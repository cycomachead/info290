o
a
pretty
good
brew
though
like
many
ig
beers
not
quite
perfect
soso
looks
shame
the
head
disappears
too
rapidly
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
a
pleasant
mix
of
caramel
malt
dried
fruit
yeast
esters
and
mild
woodiness
the
cherrywood
adds
something
but
the
effect
is
subtle
body
is
ok
the
biggest
problem
is
that
the
character
seems
too
clean
and
polished
i
reckon
bottle
conditioning
would
add
a
layer
of
complexity
that
would
give
it
a
boost
however
it
goes
down
easily
enough
on
a
winters
evening
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
m
thick
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
yet
with
plenty
of
carbonation
to
keep
my
palate
relatively
cleansed
the
flavors
are
robust
and
full
and
never
let
you
truly
forget
what
you
are
tasting
i
feel
like
this
could
be
part
of
a
compote
for
pancakes
or
something
breakfasty
i
like
it
but
not
quite
to
the
same
extent
as
other
ig
fare
still
a
very
good
beer
that
is
innovative
using
the
canadian
cherrywood
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
overall
its
another
great
beer
by
ig
wellbalanced
and
no
traces
of
alcohol
despite
its
8
3
abv
o
once
again
innis
and
gunn
have
produced
a
winner
for
me
smooth
and
flavoursome
this
is
a
wonderful
ale
and
i
find
it
to
be
very
good
with
potato
and
leek
dishes
if
you
are
vegetarian
then
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
a
stew
o
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
one
im
rather
disappointed
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
a
scottish
canadian
so
i
felt
it
represented
both
very
well
the
cherrywood
adds
a
nice
twist
to
the
regular
oak
aged
innis
gunn
its
a
kind
of
beer
where
you
would
like
2
or
3
at
the
pub
watching
the
game
served
from
the
bottle
at
the
toronto
festival
of
beer
this
like
several
ig
offerings
hit
me
as
immediately
really
overwhelmingly
sweet
with
a
woody
vanilla
tone
a
lot
of
candied
woody
character
you
definitely
pick
up
a
lot
of
the
cherry
wood
aspects
which
is
interesting
but
also
frustratingly
overpowering
i
found
it
too
sweet
and
woody
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
things
they
have
done
overall
one
of
the
better
and
more
enjoyable
ones
from
ig
but
still
doesnt
blow
me
away
like
the
original
did
when
i
first
had
it
but
with
some
slightly
different
nuances
and
a
well
hidden
abv
you
could
do
far
worse
than
this
at
its
price
point
a
definite
try
for
ig
fans
overall
an
excellent
end
to
a
long
saturday
day
of
work
in
the
house
cheers
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
porter
glass
a
nice
beer
and
similar
in
a
lot
of
ways
to
the
breweries
original
beer
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
despite
the
huge
alcohol
content
and
the
touches
of
alcohol
dotted
throughout
the
taste
sweet
and
sugary
with
plenty
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
and
the
warming
alcohol
feel
to
the
palate
was
very
nice
overall
its
a
lovely
idea
that
wasnt
executed
well
bottle
poured
a
clear
but
dark
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
notes
with
light
woody
notes
taste
is
also
quiet
sweet
which
probably
originated
from
the
maple
syrup
body
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
too
sweet
for
the
style
but
nice
used
of
cherry
wood
o
its
a
tasty
brew
with
both
the
cherry
and
the
wood
making
itself
known
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
some
but
it
suits
me
just
fine
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
one
again
no
problem
not
overly
complex
but
has
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
8
3
overall
a
decent
somewhat
complex
beer
but
it
still
misses
the
mark
for
me
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
and
somewhat
limits
drinkability
still
a
nice
effort
by
innis
and
gunn
quite
good
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
as
a
beverage
is
rates
higher
than
how
it
matches
the
style
but
no
one
will
complain
carbonation
could
be
higher
overall
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
but
i
found
it
very
smooth
tasty
oak
aged
old
ale
well
worth
the
6
dollar
price
for
more
than
a
bombers
worth
overall
okay
i
guess
perhaps
a
little
cloying
in
a
way
something
about
reminds
me
of
an
icewine
flavour
wise
anyways
worth
a
shot
but
wouldnt
pick
up
again
od
that
medicinal
note
was
a
bit
off
putting
and
the
cherry
note
came
out
as
blueberry
later
too
althought
it
wasnt
too
bad
it
didnt
impress
me
all
that
much
bought
this
because
my
wife
has
a
soft
spot
for
maple
beers
pleasantly
surprised
cant
taste
much
hops
or
maple
sweet
cherry
predominates
first
sip
seems
a
bit
too
sweet
but
after
that
it
just
becomes
delicious
you
can
certainly
taste
the
alcohol
but
its
very
drinkable
although
others
suggest
it
as
a
dessert
wine
we
had
it
with
sweet
and
savory
pizza
with
good
results
i
will
definitely
buy
again
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
i
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
around
me
so
that
i
could
always
have
it
in
reserve
when
i
want
to
take
a
break
from
my
standard
ipa
for
something
on
the
sweeter
side
this
beer
would
also
pair
well
with
a
smoked
pulled
pork
or
a
thick
hunk
of
pork
belly
mouthfeel
medium
body
low
carbonation
feels
sort

had
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
with
fish
chips
not
much
of
a
head
with
a
little
lacing
this
was
a
very
light
tasting
beer
with
a
distinct
cherrywood
flavor
somewhat
woody
but
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
the
beer
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
would
make
a
good
sipping
ale
for
the
summertime
overall
this
beer
was
somewhat
of
a
let
down
and
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
i
still
hold
hope
for
the
company
though
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
overall
it
is
sweet
of
maple
fruit
and
other
sugars
but
is
balanced
out
by
some
of
the
wood
boozy
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
of
the
brew
a
nice
one
to
give
a
go
to
found
this
beer
on
display
in
my
local
distributor
intrigued
by
the
cherrywood
cracked
it
open
with
a
friend
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
the
thick
reddish
head
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
admired
its
coppery
red
orange
color
took
a
sip
and
absolutely
loved
it
not
sure
about
tasting
any
cherrywood
but
definitely
a
lot
going
on
slightly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
nice
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
smooth
recommend
it
750

an

head
retention
and

are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
cherries
wood
maple
and
bready
malt
i
think
the
taste
mostly
follows
the
aroma
with
the
cherry
and
wood
flavors
being
the
strongest
its
a
sweet
fruity
ale
theres
also
some
caramel
and
candied
fruit
flavors
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
i
liked
this
brew
its
definitely
worth
a
try
7
99
a
bottle
the
1
pint
9
oz
bottle
took
a
long
time
to
down
and
much
of
it
had
to
do
with
the
alcohol
it
could
be
viewed
as
too
similar
to
the
other
more
popular
beers
from
these
guys
but
for
me
this
was
a
nice
example
of
what
an
english
strong
ale
should
be
the
hops
arent
here
but
everything
else
is
and
someone
looking
for
a
good
dessert
beer
to
split
without
the
sour
tartness
of
the
cherries
would
be
wise
to
start
here
innis
and
gunn
beers
are
different
and
not
for
everyone
but
those
who
are
patient
will
be
well
rewarded
with
a
subtly
smooth
and
strong
beer
thats
worth
the
time
it
takes
to
finish
it
off
much
like
the
rum
cask
version
of
innis
and
gunn
this
fits
solidly
into
the
after
dinner
beer
category
a
sweet
maltforward
ale
thats
not
all
that
complex
but
quite
enjoyable
i
like
that
taste
its
honestly
difficult
to
say
whats
going
on
but
rest
assured
i
like
it
still
a
bit
sweet
overall
a
full
flavored
but
fairly
light
bodied
beer
not
my
favorite
from
ig
but
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
a
variety
of
cuisine
pours
ruby
red
with
a
nice
white
red
head
the
smell
is
a
cherry
oak
smell
that
is
very
pleasant
actually
i
really
didnt
think
this
would
be
all
that
good
but
from
the
look
and
smell
it
seems
it
could
be
ok
the
taste
is
better
than
ok
by
far
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
with
hints
of
sweet
cherry
kind
of
an
oak
presence
that
fit
very
well
too
overall
i
went
from
thinking
of
this
as
a
gimmic
beer
to
one
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
nice
work
by
innis
gunn
which
i
havent
had
much
of
before
but
will
try
more
now
very
much
an
innis
and
gunn
beer
all
of
their
limited
editions
are
really
just
twists
off
of
their
malty
complex
sweet
wood
style
of
brewing
this
is
no
different
im
really
not
sure
what
the
cherrywood
is
giving
to
the
equation
theres
maybe
a
light
amount
of
cherry
flavor
but
that
might
be
me
imagining
it
due
to
the
cherry
on
the
label
but
the
maple
syrup
contributes
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
to
the
finish
very
tasty
as
expected
from
ig
but
doesnt
bring
too
much
new
to
the
table
o
very
enjoyable
a
desert
beer
for
sure
lots
of
bright
fruit
and
can
be
quite
complex
82
overall
nice
enough
not
sure
what
the
cherrywood
treatment
has
done
for
it
tasty
for
what
its
worth
if
youre
ok
with
the
sweetness
this
is
one
almost
slavish
ode
to
canadian
sensibilities
which
im
sure
was
the
intent
all
along
maple
wood
and
strong
beer
whats
a
hoser
not
to
like
other
than
that
this
happens
to
be
made
outside
our
borders
imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
and
all
that
i
suppose
an
above
average
ale
with
some
nice
aroma
and
body
and
a
decent
flavor
nothing
special
but
certainly
enjoyable
and
refreshing
o
ultimately
a
little
too
lightweight
for
my
tastes
but
id
drink
it
again
oa
boring
bland
beer
makes
me
wonder
why
i
pick
up
middle
ages
when
i
see
it
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
fits
well
in
the
winter
but
could
use
some
more
oomph
if
i
am
to
put
on
my
wizards
hat
and
peer
into
the
future
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
i
enjoyed
it
but
theres
just
not
that
much
magic
to
it
it
is
another
beer
that
fits
squarely
into
the
ambit
of
middle
ages
abilities
which
is
to
provide
nothing
less
and
nothing
more
than
agreeable
if
slightly
more
hoppy
englishinspired
offerings
o
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
or
maybe
from
last
year
no
bottle
date
but
if
this
is
what
was
intended
it
is
not
good
got
through
half
the
glass
before
opting
to
drain
pour
overall
i
want
badly
to
like
this
beer
and
have
since
i
discovered
middle
ages
winter
styles
are
some
of
my
favorites
and
this
is
an
interesting
take
its
definitely
got
their
signature
style
and
has
elements
that
bring
to
mind
both
kilt
tilter
and
swallow
wit
but
it
drinks
something
like
what
i
imagine
an
imperial
macro
lager
to
be
which
is
decidedly
painful
for
me
to
say
theres
something
worthwhile
there
but
it
needs
to
be
tweaked
before
it
stacks
up
against
the
brewerys
other
excellent
offerings
i
definitely
recommend
drinking
it
at
room
temp
or
just
below
o
for
what
i
paid
im
a
bit
disappointed
still
its
better
than
adjunct
stuff
by
far
not
that
that
says
much
middle
ages
has
had
some
good
selections
and
some
that
are
just
okay
i
feel
like
this
ale
falls
into
the
latter
still
not
sad
that
i
at
least
tried
it
unfortunately
ive
got
another
5
to
try
after
this
round
a
nice
winter
warmer
smells
less
spiced
and
sweet
than
most
but
has
a
beautiful
aroma
like
a
strong
red
ale
with
generous
hop
additions
tastes
like
a
winter
warmer
but
again
not
spiced
and
sugary
english
malts
and
what
feels
like
dry
hopping
make
this
one
very
sessionable
have
had
this
on
tap
from
the
brewery
as
well
and
is
even
better
a
great
local
holiday
brew
and
a
nice
warm
body
buzz
the
taste
while
malty
and
sweet
as
the
nose
would
suggest
is
rather
dry
compared
to
what
id
expected
from
such
there
is
a
bit
of
harsh
assertive
carbonic
acid
behind
the
gently
sweet
malt
backbone
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
relatively
light
body
of
this
beer
as
to
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
winter
beer
varieties
it
is
rather
light
weight
and
prickly
in
texture
though
all
in
all
a
very
decent
brew
pours
with
a
nice
reddish
body
thin
wispy
head
as
expected
from
a
cask
beer
the
aroma
has
good
strong
maltiness
without
much
bitterness
this
is
somewhat
different
than
the
taste
which
has
a
distinct
bitterness
the
body
is
quite
thin
even
for
a
cask
beer
it
ready
detracts
from
the
beer
not
their
best
showing
wizards
winter
ale
is
a
very
clear
sparkling
copper
ale
with
a
thin
off
white
foam
that
quickly
fades
to
a
blotchy
bubbly
film
and
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
malty
toasty
aroma
its
pretty
light
bodied
a
little
flat
and
a
little
watery
the
finish
is
a
little
scratchy
it
doesnt
taste
as
sweet
as
it
smells
a
pretty
strong
green
bitterness
dominates
the
taste
its
quite
well
balanced
and
no
particular
flavor
really
sticks
out
the
toastiness
is
prominent
and
its
perhaps
a
bit
nutty
its
not
too
bad
d
goes
down
pretty
sweet
and
smooth
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
though
in
some
ways
it
seems
more
like
a
belgian
style
dubbel
dfairly
drinkabke
if
i
wanted
to
have
it
again
pours
amber

with
a
good
amount

hangs
around
smells
bitter
and
fruity
like
a
poorly
made
lager
overall
not
very
tasty
the
herbs
and
spices
are
covered
by
a
undesirable
taste
that
i
cant
describe
well
overall
an
undesirable
brew
s
i
think
its
worth
the
price
less
than
1
50
a
bottle
and
i
might
buy
it
again
in
a
mixed

i
dont
think
id
search
it
out
or
recommend
it
but
id
share
it
d
i
wont
be
picking
up
any
more
of
this
when
i
go
back
up
to
ny
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
and
i
never
heard
anything
back
from
the
brewery
after
i
sent
them
an
email
about
my
bottle
bomb
not
sure
why
its
sold
as
a

an
interesting
coppery
amber
sticky
but
certainly
not
a
malty
beer
in
itself
hops
serve
merely
as
bittering
and
balance
more
toward
a
fine
english
strong
ale
big
malt
profile
with
hints
of
molasses
and
raisin
mild
alcoholic
taste
with
good
balance
of
goldings
hops
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
i
find
it
quite
yummy
way
too
light
bodied
and
lacking
the
rich
flavors
i
look
for
in
the
style
some
definite
off
flavors
with
metallic
and
bitter
fruity
hints
throwing
off
the
malts
and
becoming
a
distraction
far
bigger
beer
than
most
browns
bordering
on
the
imperial
stout
realm
not
as
black
and
balanced
a
little
dryer
im
kicking
myself
that
i
bypassed
this
one
as
often
as
i
have
in
the
past
damn
good
beer
at
an
excellent
price
point
i
think
this
beer
is
very
understated
it
starts
out
with
hop
notes
and
then
complexly
traverses
an
earthy
porter
finish
it
is
a
fresh
beer
that
could
be
drank
year
round
as
it
is
fresh
but
also
dark
and
could
be
appreciated
in
the
winter
time
after
a
day
working
outside
or
by
the
campfire

with

rye
medium

the

i
bet
its
really
good
on

not
a
style
that
im
typically
interested
in
but
i
can
see
the
appeal
o
decent
english
strong
ale
lots
of
alcohol
but
blended
in
nicely
with
the
malt
o
a
flavorful
english
style
pub
ale
with
remarkably
well
hidden
alcohol
recommended
goes
down
real
easy
in
spite
of
the
high
alcohol
content
be
careful
overall
my
favorite
offering
from
nimbus
i
would
like
to
try
this
from
a
caskbeer
engine
or
on
nitro
i
think
it
would
compliment
bread
pudding
brie
mashed
potatoes
and
game
hen
defiantly
a
good
beer
to
nurse
in
a
pub
on
a
rainy
day
while
watching
cricket
or
rowing
overall
outstanding
nose
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
that
this
is
a
mellow
strong
ale
from
nimbus
and
an
acceptable
one
at
that
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
somewhat
the
same
but
there
is
a
metallic
flavor
that
overwhelms
everything
else
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
a
fine
beer
dont
age
it
in
the
12
oz
bottle
though
overall
lacks
complexity
depth
and
more
importantly
some
much
needed
smoothness
for
a
second
i
thought
maybe
some
age
would
smooth
it
out
but
i
changed
my
mind
finish
is
a
bit
disappointing
but
overall
not
bad
pours
a
pretty
deep
brown
mahogany
hue
head
basically
doesnt
exist
maybe
a
little
bit
of
brown
foam
but
thats
about
it
smells
like
deep
roasted
malts
dont
detect
any
fruit
citrus
pine
or
any
hint
of
hops
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
has
a
full
and
thick
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
beer
no
complexity
but
no
flaws
either
just
a
good
beer
a
bit
funky
in
tastesmell
which
keeps
the
mystery
throughout
the
glass
and
keeps
me
drinking
it
trying
to
figure
out
the
ingredients
very
lightly
carbonated
and
the
mouthfeel
keeps
throwing
me
off
not
a
bad
sipping
beer
at
all
but
i
dont
think
i
can
handle
more
than
one
in
a
session
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
a
few
flaws
with
not
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
drinkability
is
high
this
is
my
favorite
nimbus
ale
by
a
long
shot
loads
of
character
flavor
yet
still
dangerously
quaffable
i
monkeyed
around
to
much
with
their
lesser
offering
before
this
o
a
very
tasty
beer
that
could
be
drank
on
its
own
it
could
go
with
a
burger
or
fish
and
chips
nice
job
nimbus
this
beer
rocks
poured
from
a
standard
bottle
into

not
much
of
an
aroma
but
good
deep

i
liked
the
taste
a
little
hoppy
with
a
slightly
astringent
taste
and
good
fullbodied
mouthfeel
very
little

good

i
am
a
sucker
for
full
bodied
beers
a
very
nice
malty
treat
i
could
see
kicking
a
few
of
these
back
in
an
evening
old
monkeyshine
is
intriguing
it
provides
subtle
yet
enjoyable
flavors
amidst
a
big
body
an
an
equally
hefty
abv
i
like
the
nimble
hand
nimbus
played
with
this
one
heavy
carbonation
with
a
light
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
i
would
say
that
old
monkeyshine
has
a
mediumlight
body
with
light
carbonation
that
aids
the
kent
golding
hops
in
creating
a
mild
spiciness
throughout
the
drink
the
hops
really
shine
more
in
the
mouth
than
under
the
nose
but
they
mix
really
well
with
the
strong
roasted
malts
and
caramel
neither
overpowering
nor
lingering
in
the
depths
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
is
that
although
it
holds
a
hefty
8
2
avb
in
a
12oz
bottle
the
only
time
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
is
when
your
head
becomes
airy
and
delicately
fuzzy
halfway
through
there
is
no
trace
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
and
the
roasted
malts
do
a
fantastic
job
of
keeping
the
taste
out
good
example
of
the
style
almost
too
easy
to
drink
for
what
it
is
drink
well
done
a
simple
beer
that
when
fresh
is
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
for
the
higher
abv
pretty
impressive
for
the
style
one
of
the
best
english
strong
ales
ive
had
old
monkeyshine
my
sister
had
a
bottle
of
this
one
in
her
fridge
already
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
drinking
some
local
tucson
brewed
beer
from
nimbus
brewing
co
it
poured
a
deep
teak
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
it
smelled
like
light
vanilla
light
roast
and
a
bit
caramely
it
tasted
light
at
first
then
a
nice
roasted
malt
with
bourbon
notes
come
in
and
leave
a
little
burn
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
was
looking
on
their
website
and
apparently
they
have
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
of
this
at
least
at
the
brewery
i
wish
we
had
made
it
out
to
the
brewery
as
our
visit
to
the
barrio
brewing
co
seemed
a
bit
wasted
overall
i
really
like
this
style
because
it
is
nearly
but
not
quite
many
other
styles
almost
like
a
jack
of
all
trades
but
master
of
none
for
oldstrong
ales
this
example
is
a
good
one
and
worth
trying
to
you
can
get
a
bottle
poured
mahogany
with
a
two
finger
very
frothy
head
lively
carbonation
emanates
from
the
body
of
the
beer
nose
faintly
picks
up
melted
caramel
and
cinnamon
oatmeal
which
disappoints
only
in
that
i
would
love
to
have
had
these
two
aromas
violently
collide
against
my
senses
hops
are
in
the
background
again
faint
to
the
nose
raisins
cherries
are
dominate
the
taste
which
is
accompanies
the
malt
and
finishes
with
a
delicate
touch
of
hops
that
disguises
the
alcohol
well
what
i
notice
is
that
the
aftertaste
is
mainly
caramel
which
doesnt
please
me
that
much
since
i
dont
find
that
flavor
to
work
well
with
the
initial
raisincherry
taste
that
said
it
is
a
pleasure
to
have
this
after
a
very
long
day
because
the
malthop
balance
along
with
the
interesting
flavors
makes
this
ale
symbiotically
dance
across
my
palate
having
one
or
two
max
would
be
a
pleasure
on
any
random
weeknight
any
more
would
be
a
bit
risky
due
to
the
abv
thanks
goes
out
again
to
bennetj17
for
the
hookup
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
rich
copper
chestnut
color
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
off
white
foam
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
rich
roasted
grains
deeply
caramelized
malt
nuts
such
a
hazelnut
hints
of
brown
sugar
a
bit
fruity
the
ale
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
pretty
tasty

overall

the

this
is
a
decent
beer
at
a
good
price
would
try
again
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
was
good
even
with
the
8ish
abv
its
a
semi
session
beer
if
that
even
makes
sense
d
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
an
interesting
taste
that
pretty
enjoyable
worth
trying
sometime
moderate
malts
continue
to
the
taste
somewhat
complex
with
caramel
nut
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
a
sweetness
envelops
it
all
making
the
flavors
a
bit
difficult
to
ascertain
the
same
sweetness
certainly
not
overdone
helps
give
the
beer
a
smooth
feel
finishes
dry
with
a
quick
close
good
carbonation
and
richer
in

than
most
ales
of
the
style
my
brother
in
law
raves
about
this
stuff
as
he
is
from
tucson
pours
dark
brown
almost
looks
like
a
porter
aroma
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
some
dried
fruits
taste
is
dominated
by
alcohol
then
the
sweet
malt
and
caramel
flavors
come
through
earthy
finish
decent
beer
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
2
at
one
time
like
tucson
more
is
not
better
d
it
goes
down
good
i
dont
get
hung
up
on
all
the
nuances
of
beer
if
it
tastes
good
i
will
drink
it
not
too
impressed
but
it
works
i
could
really
see
it
being
a
more
cold
weather
beer
something
to
warm
you
up
a
bit
it
does
pack
a
decent
abv
although
i
couldnt
really
taste
it
worth
a
try
this
is
an
interesting
brew
and
though
the
flavours
i
mentioned
say
it
is
very
complex
i
feel
the
flavours
are
actually
on
the
subdued
side
thats
ok
for
an
english
brown
but
with
the
bigger
abv
content
than
is
the
norm
i
guess
i
expected
more
still
pretty
tasty
brew
though
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
and
it
hides
its
strong
8
2
abv
quite
well
enjoy
a
bottle
but
i
would
probably
only
go
for
one
maybe
two
at
most
that
a
small
quibble
as
this
is
utterly
enjoyable
and
monstrously
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
complexity
and
uniqueness
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
easytoconsume
beer
overall
nice
balance
bet
it
would
drink
well
with
food
such
as
a
good
nutty
aged
cheese
or
something
off
the
grill
id
give
this
another
go
when
we
next
pay
az
a
visit
as
brown
ales
go
this
is
one
of
the
strangest
ive
tasted
not
a
bad
flavor
just
strange
i
dont
quite
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
pciked
this
up
in
sedona
saw
the
name
old
monkeyshine
and
thought
it
was
a
bwine
did
not
read
the
label
dooooh
it
was
a
good
english
ale
poured
a
darkbrown
with
a
ruby
highlight
nice
dirty
white
head
average
carbonation
taste
was
of
some
coffee
choc
and
something
else
that
i
could
not
pick
up
on
maybe
the
taste
uds
were
off
it
was
a
good
drink
and
the
abv
is
perfect
good
beer
md
carbonation
is
just
right
and
helps
to
produce
a
creamy
medium
bodied
beer
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
as
well
i
have
to
admit
after
my
first
experience
with
nimbus
i
am
quite
surprised
by
this
offering
it
has
a
lot
going
on
for
it
with
the
hop
character
and
although
maybe
not
totally
appropriate
for
the
style
really
go
a
long
way
an
interesting
flavor
especially
considering
the
style
the
only
real
deterrent
is
the
tartness
which
is
fine
but
it
creates
an
unwelcome
pucker
in
the
mouth
otherwise
this
is
a
real
enjoyable
rather
unique
take
on
a
style
that
could
use
a
few
cracks
upside
the
head
thanks
to
msubulldog25
he
with
the
righteous
beercloset
for
sending
and
allowing
me
to
sample
my
firstever
arizona
beer
thanks
to
tayner
another
extra
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
type
beer
itd
be
good
on
a
cold
day
but
how
many
of
those
are
there
in
tucson
good
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
nimbus
but
not
all
that
remarkable
easy
to
drink
for
a
big
brown
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
is
ok
very
drinkable
for
an
8
abv
beer
i
finished
the
whole
growler
in
a
sitting
when
i
visit
nimbus
on
my
birthday
i
pretty
much
drink
as
many
as
are
bought
for
me
and
the
last
one
is
as
good
as
the
first
bottom
line
this
is
the
beer
that
should
make
nimbus
famous
and
if
youve
only
had
old
monkeyshine
in
bottles
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
it
on
tap
d
i
enjoyed
this
ale
from
nimbus
my
first
from
this
company
makes
me
interested
to
try
their
other
beers
12
oz
stubbie
the
beer
is
a
deep
and
sinister
amber
color
with
a
2finger
ivory
head
that
sits
nicely
as
a
finger
of
foam
over
after
settling
clarity
is
good
and
there
are
nice
fine
bubbles
cascading
up
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
rife
with
raisin
malt
moderate
caramel
sweetness
and
a
healthy
smokey
phenolic
character
that
i
wasnt
expecting
its
not
bad
at
all
just
was
a
shock
the
flavor
is
spot
on
to
the
aroma
hitting
with
raisin
and
smoke
initially
moving
to
a
more
rounded
caramel
sweetness
ladened
with
peppery
hop
that
may
have
been
more
brilliant
when
this
was
closer
to
the
bottling
date
the
finish
moves
back
to
a
caramelsoaked
rainsin
and
a
mild
bitter
bite
there
is
a
touch
of
orangey
sweetness
throughout
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
very
mild
carbonation
with
a
fairly
strong
drying
quality
on
the
finish
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
one
im
just
starting
to
feel
a
little
warmth
in
my
stomach
after
making
my
way
through
most
of
the
bottle
i
think
the
phenols
add
a
nice
touch
to
it
the
color
was
a
medium
dark
brown
when
poured
with
tan
foam
and
lots
of
lace
the
smell
of
tobacco
was
evident
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
but
after
the
first
sip
i
got
a
tart
tobaccochocolate
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
i
think
the
tobacco
was
the
main
stand
out
on
this
brown
ale
i
never
tasted
a
brown
ale
with
this
kind
of
flavor
at
all
a
nice
brew
sent
by
bennetj17
and
solomon420
for
my
ba
annv
a
little
overly
sweet
but
enjoyable
kinda
what
youd
expect
from
a
southern
style
brown
ale
hovering
around
8
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
just
because
it
gets
a
little
tiresome
towards
the
end
mouthfeedrinkability
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fuller
thatn
im
used
to
for
a
brown
but
it
seems
to
fit
this
flaover
profile
just
right
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
the
only
thing
than
would
keep
this
from
be
a
good
session
beer
for
me
is
the
alcohol
notes
astringent
at
times
tobacco
and
slightly
oxidized
i
didnt
particularly
like
its
lack
of
focus
as
it
jumps
from
taste
to
taste
and
when
it
tries
to
meld
together
it
doesnt
work
well
ok
d
very
drinkable
too
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
d
could
have
a
few
of
these
not
too
many
because
they
are
a
tad
pricey
and
suprisingly
high
in
the
abv
percentage
a
good
beer
would
drink
again
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
which
does
not
last
long
some
islands
and
sticky
lacing
remained
the
nose
is
malty
roasty
and
some
caramel
going
on
in
there
the
taste
is
very
nice
of
slight
roasted
malts
and
a
nice
bitter
dry
hop
finish
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
medium
body
very
drinkable
the
best
nimbus
by
far
for
me
a
nice
surprise
this
beer
has
morphed
quite
a
bit
over
the
last
year
and
i
find
that
most
of
the
changes
are
positive
ones
i
will
probably
call
this
experiment
a
success
and
will
buy
more
of
this
to
age
across
a
span
of
a
few
years
just
out
of
curiosity
glad
i
tried
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
carbonation
levels
seem
to
be
good
pretty
easy
to
drink
much
more
so
than
my
previous
try
at
this
brewery
alcohol
is
well
hidden
basically
nonexistant
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
easily
thanks
to
solomon420
for
enabling
me
to
try
this
as
a
throw
in
pours
a
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
short
lived
tan
head
scents
of
dried
fruit
malt
and
weak
coffee
roasted
flavors
prevalent
throughout
coffee
prunes
and
sweetness
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
a
big
fan
of
coffee
scented
or
darker
roasted
brews
thanks
to
solomon420
for
the
bottle
this
drinks
very
easy
for
the
8
2abv
this
posesses
probably
the
best
az
beer
i
had
more
reviews
to
follow
will
save
the
rest
of
these
for
the
too
soon
cold
nights
that
precede
winter
id
give
this
one
a
try
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
tasty
potent
brew
i
could
easily
make
a
session
out
of
this
one
if
it
was
available
in
my
cool
climate
i
would
always
have
some
of
these
on
hand
very
yummy
brew
anyone
who
likes
this
style
should
find
a
way
to
check
it
out
d
bigtime
thanks
to
damian
for
sending
me
a
bunch
of
these
very
happy
ive
got
a
few
left
a
good
change
of
pace
in
these
hot
summer
months
highly
recommended
overall
and
outstanding
session
brew
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
and
very
nice
for
the
style
this
is
the
last
of
the
nimbus
beers
i
was
sent
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
damn
nice
brewery
and
i
have
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
these
nimbus
beers
malty
spicy
aroma
with
hints
of
tobacco
caramel
and
bread
pudding
deep
brown
with
a
small
head
but
ample
lacing
sweet
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
flavors
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
plesant
thick
breadiness
very
nicely
done
beer
from
a
brewery
worthy
of
more
notice
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
with
a
tankhaki
color
head
that
foams
very
nicely
and
leaves
nice
lace
good
head
retention
just
to
my
liking
smell
is
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
gives
a
good
indication
of
the
taste
the
taste
is
excellently
balanced
a
perfect
mix
of
malt
sweetness
and
bitter
aftertaste
feels
exceptionally
smooth
in
your
mouth
with
nice
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
i
love
this
beer
it
is
definately
my
favorite
beer
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
it
is
8
2
abv
so
you
have
to
be
careful
with
how
much
you
drink
it
catches
up
with
you
this
beer
is
definately
worth
a
try
my
favorite
beer
i
have
tried
so
far
notes
drinkability
is
much
higher
than
i
expected
from
the
aroma
this
seems
highly
sessionable
for
an
8
beer
not
unbelievably
outstanding
or
anything
but
definitely
worth
your
time
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
good
creamy
maltiness
even
at
slightly
over
8
alcohol
im
finding
this
quite
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
thanks
to
autumnaldave
for
the
sample
being
it
my
first
but
hopefully
not
last
from
nimbus
beer
is
good
happy
big
esb
beering
drinkability
notes

overall
an
interesting
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
despite
the
elevated
alcohol
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
pretty
god
retention
aroma
contains
lots
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
toffee
the
sweet
roasted
malt
also
dominates
taste
with
a
light
hop
presence
at
the
end
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
liking
but
alcohol
is
well
hidden
first
what
is
an
english
style
ale
i
would
not
have
had
to
have
lived
in
yorkshire
to
know
that
there
is
no
single
englihs
style
ale
and
even
if
there
is
a
typical
english
pub
ale
say
a
bitter
this
beer
would
not
be
it
in
fact
i
would
argue
that
old
monkeyshine
more
closely
resembles
a
strong
scotch
ale
getting
nimbus
taxonomy
the
beer
is
not
bad
it
has
a
plesant
deep
mahagony
color
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sweet
and
alcoholic
but
not
unapatising
hints
of
rasions
and
caramel
finishes
slightly
tart
supprisingly
drinkable
for
its
strength
it
might
do
quite
nicely
on
a
cool
desert
winters
night
this
beer
really
surprised
me
while
its
listed
as
a
brown
ale
on
here
on
nimbus
website
its
called
a
strong
ale
at
8
2
abv
you
cant
really
disagree
with
nimbus
when
i
poured
it
and
saw
that
it
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
my
mind
flashed
back
to
tommyknockers
imperial
nut
brown
a
highlytouted
highlyalcoholic
brown
ale
that
i
really
didnt
like
monkeyshine
is
completely
different
though
in
the
tommyknocker
the
alcohol
was
the
dominant
flavor
while
here
its
just
a
hint
im
amazed
how
well
its
hidden
im
more
amazed
that
it
tastes
so
good
malty
sweet
and
brown
sugary
in
the
beginning
with
a
lingering
bitter
finish
i
gave
it
a
4
5
in
drinkability
simply
because
its
as
easy
to
drink
as
the
yuengling
traditional
lager
i
had
last
night
but
with
more
flavor
and
double
the
alcohol
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
here
its
right
up
there
with
the
best
hearty
thanks
go
out
to
gueuzedude
for
allowing
me
to
try
this
wonderful
beer
nice
malty
taste
with
a
little
more
hop
bite
than
expected
maybe
too
much
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
until
it
hits
the
gut
middle
of
the
sip
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
hints
of
raisins
and
sugars
finish
is
of
slight
alcohol
and
hops
well
to
be
honest
at
first
i
didnt
like
the
taste
too
much
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
it
at
first
i
think
i
drank
the
first
bottle
too
cold
the
next
day
i
drank
another
bottle
more
towards
room
temperature
and
wow
what
flavour
it
had
its
noted
as
a
brown
ale
but
if
you
hold
it
up
the
sunset
the
colours
come
alive
more
of
a
dark
redhoney
hue
i
have
to
think
that
it
was
partly
the
mood
i
was
in
and
the
setting
that
allowed
me
to
enjoy
it
this
time
i
would
definately
buy
some
more
this
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
it
is
fairly
clear
with
just
a
hint
of
chill
haze
it
smell
malty
sweet
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
nose
nice
full
bodied
with
a
malty
expression
this
beer
tenderly
coats
your
mouth
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
as
an
english
expression
of
a
strong
ale
should
be
there
is
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
that
helps
to
carry
the
maltiness
of
this
brew
tasted
at
the
2002
oregon
brewers
festival
light
brown
color
aroma
is
small
white
and
foamy
aroma
is
malty
nutty
and
very
sweet
deep
malt
flavor
not
very
hoppy
lighter
bodied
nice
flavor
rich
and
round
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
would
be
interesting
to
know
if
they
use
high
alphahigh
cohumulone
hops
in
all
their
beers
there
was
a
harsh
taste
in
both
beers
i
tried
a
nice
deep
mahogany
color
on
the
pour
the
head
is
moderate
in
size
the
texture
spumescent
beige
in
color
and
as
it
dissipates
the
left
over
lace
a
nice
coating
on
the
glass
floral
nose
sweet
malt
caramel
and
quite
fresh
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
with
the
start
sweet
and
malt
the
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
a
hop
heads
delight
boom
right
in
the
palate
as
the
hops
over
run
your
taste
buds
mildly
acidic
dry
as
a
desert
bone
aftertaste
and
a
real
treat
for
this
old
strong
ale
lover
a
very
fine
beer
seems
more
like
a
barley
wine
than
a
brown
ale
to
me
probably
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
and
im
fairly
picky
when
it
comes
to
the
style
a
terrific
beer
was
very
excited
to
pop
this
open
amongst
friends
however
the
bottle
that
was
dated
2013
was
most
definitely
infected
horribly
sour
finish
i
know
its
not
fair
to
judge
on
one
bad
bottle
it
happens
i
will
revisit
and
update
my
review
at
some
time
sweet
and
rich
flavours
vanilla
oak
malt
sultanas
caramel
dries
out
in
the
finish
creating
a
slightly
abrasive
contrast
to
the
initial
flavours
exceptional
beer
great
look
taste
and
feel
good
head
that
dissolves
to
a
low
but
laces
the
glass
first
time
having
this
beer
and
i
will
definitely
keep
one
in
my
beer
fridge
from
here
on
out
exceptional
on
all
levels
glad
i
was
able
to
experience
this
balanced
tasteful
and
smooth
find
one
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
highly
recommend
everything
from
this
masterful
companies
offerings
will
not
disappoint
at
least
not
me
or
my
taste
buds
a1
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
i
am
on
the
fence
as
to
if
i
would
pay
12
again
for
this
it
is
a
very
good
brew
but
does
not
command
a
world
class
price
bottle
poured
a
deep
amber
color
ale
with
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
nice
caramelized
malt
notes
with
subtle
toffee
notes
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
caramelized
malt
notes
with
light
toffee
notes
with
a
hint
of
residual
sugar
notes
malt
notes
are
really
well
balanced
and
showed
clear
cereal
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
good
example
of
a
style
that
should
be
brewed
more
often
overall
just
a
darn
good
beer
to
drink
with
some
crackers
o
as
noted
earlier
theres
a
lot
of
similarities
to
english
barleywine
but
lacks
the
warmth
additional
alcohol
and
fuller
body
as
well
as
some
carbonation
of
those
brews
very
complex
and
interesting
though
oone
of
the
best
big
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
alcohol
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
other
traits
ridiculuously
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
good
luck
trying
to
recreate
a
clone
as
you
need
open
air
stone
vats
and
centuries
old
oak
barrels
a
special
occasion
beer
another
sam
smith
winner
o
great
beer
albeit
quite
different
from
my
expectations
would
buy
again
as
far
as
i
know
this
beer
is
not
obtainable
in
my
town
but
was
bought
at
wordens
market
in
missoula
montana
in
the
wake
of
a
beatdown
by
my
alma
mater
university
of
montana
the
griz
formerly
bruins
in
their
old
rivalry
with
the
montana
state
bobcats
formerly
aggies
an
excellent
beer
that
i
just
had
to
try
stingo
is
one
of
those
crazy
styles
thats
different
every
time
you
see
one
which
is
all
too
infrequently
these
days
this
is
one
of
the
classics
maybe
the
longest
running
in
our
market
and
just
phenomenal
in
every
way
whether
they
take
some
of
this
out
and
do
it
with
cherries
or
blend
some
lacto
soured
beer
back
into
the
mix
there
is
no
denying
its
complexity
dried
fruity
finish
and
tannic
pucker
uncommon
in
english
beer
amazingly
rich
malt
forward
but
so
interesting
not
chocolate
or
caramel
or
normal
english
yeast
but
somehow
drawing
on
all
of
these
its
more
mature
aged
in
oak
and
mellowed
and
better
integrated
than
most
others
i
get
a
ton
of
cherry
in
the
finish
through
the
rich
but
tannic
froth
on
the
back
end
and
there
is
just
a
slight
tartness
like
fruit
from
the
tree
a
few
weeks
before
its
pickable
stingo
means
something
different
to
every
brewer
but
for
me
this
is
the
one
by
which
all
others
must
be
judged
the
original
and
still
the
best
brewed
in
2011
was
my
bottle
thanks
for
this
beauty
best
in
the
morning
or
in
the
icy
cold
overall
gotta
say
at
the
start
of
it
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
however
like
most
complex
beers
it
takes
a
few
sips
to
come
around
to
how
good
it
actually
is
the
way
the
flavors
work
together
going
from
alcoholdark
fruit
to
a
malt
caramel
nuttiness
was
superb
and
truly
left
me
wanting
more
with
each
sip
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
prevalent
perhaps
but
its
still
one
of
the
best
english
strongs
ive
had
sam
smith
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
brews
started
with
a
big
barleywine
smell
oak
was
also
big
on
the
nose
then
i
got
vanilla

poured
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
beige
head
it
was
full
bodied
had
a
nice
creaminess
and
low
level
of
carbonation
tasting
it
dark
fruits
and
raisins
were
upfront
for
me
there
was
plum
pomegranate
caramel
and
a
vanilla
finish
with
a
hint
of
oak
i
also
noticed
a
subtle
tartness
that
was
similar
to
raspberries
for
me
this
was
very
much
an
english
barleywine
i
thought
it
didnt
have
an
astounding
level
of
complexity
but
what
was
there
was
big
and
flavorful
very
nice
beer
this
is
the
arrogant
bastard
of
england
overall
i
dont
know
how
i
have
overlooked
this
beer
for
so
long
its
just
the
kind
of
beer
i
love
nice
sweet
malty
notes
along
with
great
spirit
like
character
and
just
a
bit
of
age
to
it
great
balance
and
taste
o
wellbalanced
and
complex
will
get
this
again
when
colder
weather
sets
in
slightly
tart
dry
with
an
almost
sweet
aftertaste
enjoyable
and
savory
clear
dark
amber
with

been
wanting
to
try
this
for
long
time
but
didnt
want
to
pay

i
did

im
not
really
going
to
go
into
what
i
got
on
flavor
or
aroma
but
if
you
dig
trying
to
figure
out
what
your
tasting
this
is
the
beer
to
experience
that
with
the
taste
is
complex
more
so
than
my
girlfriend
and
i
who
i
do
all
of
my
tastings
with
have
ever
experienced
just
as
a
teaser

its
fun
as

just
to
try
and
figure
out
what
youre
tasting
highly
recommended
i
would
unquestionably
buy
this
again
two
fans
through
and
through
were
made
tonight
cant
wait
to
try
their
entire
lineup
especially
the
stouts
had
not
had
this
for
many
years
until
tonight
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
used
to
drink
it
along
with
guinness
and
scotch
20
plus
years
ago
and
i
had
forgotten
what
a
complicated
beer
this
is
because
it
seems
like
the
distribution
is
heavy
on
all
samuel
smith
products
i
am
guilty
of
overlooking
this
one
too
many
times
since
then
this
is
a
unique
beer
malty
strong
alcohol
presence
with
some
raisin
and
toast
smells
definitely
in
my
book
it
is
a
strong
beer
chaser
to
straight
scotch
dont
pass
up
a
chance
to
savor
a
full
bottle
of
this
beer
and
dont
be
afraid
to
take
a
wee
dram
of
whiskey
along
with
it
taste
is
a
smooth
fruity
strong
ale
more
refined
than
most
and
goes
down
with
incredible
ease
the
hard
water
gives
it
a
little
something
for
the
complexity
that
most
american
strong
ales
miss
completely
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
though
not
a
distraction
at
all
its
an
excellent
beer
bordering
on
great
i
do
have
a
problem
with
the
pricing
though
as
mine
was
14
for
a
500
ml
definitely
worth
getting
once
to
try
maybe
even
another
to
put
back
for
a
few
years
but
as
much
as
i
like
it
i
will
likely
pass
on
it
in
the
future
just
too
much
for
my
budget
this
is
a
brew
worth
drinking
and
worth
waiting
for
never
refuse
one
of
these
another
very
good
samuel
smiths
beer
strong
from
the
start
but
it
didnt
overpower
went
down
surprisingly
easy
with
a
good
balance

i
felt
the
stingo
and
i
loved
it
thanks
to
my
sheffieldborn
professor
for
directing
me
towards
this
staple
brewing
company
i
will
certainly
buy
this
brew
again
if
you
like
english
strong
ales
or
barleywines
this
will
be
a
treat
its
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
a
very
good
if
not
mindblowing
beer
poured
from
550
ml
bomber
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
o
a
complex
and
warm
flavoured
beer
owing
to
the
use
of
old
oak
casks
making
an
interesting
sipping
beer
and
would
be
well
paired
with
dessert
and
cigars
poured
a
rich
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
slowly
to
an
offwhite
ring
leaving
little
lacing
it
looks
excellent
yeasty
and
traditional
scents
of
caramel
toffee
sour
green
apple
rich
dark
bread
fruity
esters
brown
sugar
yeasty
aromas
and
hints
of
oak
a
wonderful
well
rounded
rich
complex
and
alluring
aroma
truly
excellent
showcasing
the
malt
forward
nature
of
the
beer
the
yeast
and
the
oak
cask
aging
flavor
begins
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
and
honey
alongside
some
mellow
notes
of
apple
fruity
flavors
including
apple
but
also
dark
fruit
raisin
and
prune
mostly
appear
in
the
middle
and
continue
into
the
finish
also
appearing
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
is
a
nice
bready
malt
flavor
towards
the
finish
and
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
bit
of
oak
and
some
faint
wild
yeast
funk
a
rich
complex
combination
of
flavors
hitting
all
the
notes
i
enjoy
in
a
malty
sweet
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
drying
yet
also
sticky
feel
and
light
carbonation
a
very
easy
to
drink
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
and
quick
hiding
its
abv
overall
this
is
an
excellent
strong
ale
it
has
a
rich
complex
and
truly
wonderous
aroma
and
flavor
profile
combination
aided
in
drinkability
by
its
mellow
carbonation
and
semidrying
mouthfeel
the
barrel
aging
makes
this
beer
a
complex
yet
not
overwhelming
ale
a
wonderful
beer
and
well
worth
the
somewhat
steep
price
poured
from
the
classic
samuel
smith
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
orange
amber
brew
looks
like
moderately
strong
english
breakfast
tea
with
around
four
fingers
of
resilient
beige

is
sublime
sweet
dark
and
fruity
smells
greet
the
drinker
with

toffee
herbal

and
sour

notes
all
blending
together
to
yield
a
pretty
distinctive
nose
that
is
not
easily
forgotten
palate
is
similarly
sweet
and
fruity
i
might
describe
the
overall
impression
as
more
fruity
herbal
and
tealike
than
expected
although
there
is
certainly
a
rich
rum
cake
component
that
peeks
out
of
the
mix
evokes
marmalade
and
toast
crabapple
lemon
licorice
candy
walnut
and
floral
darjeerling
tea
some
goldings
hop
character
apparent
richly
complex
but
weighted
towards
the
fruit
and
herb
flavors
rather
than
the
malts
not
particularly
sweet
almost
light
and
fresh
with
a
decent
chewy
body
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
and
a
very
smooth
low
carbonation
mouthfeel
faint
alcohol
presence
although
this
grows
over
time
includes
the
usual
samuel
smith
kiss
of
diacetyl
and
some
oak
wood
in
the
dryish
finish
well
done
and
rather
unique
in
the
universe
of
english
style
old
ales
and
barleywines
o
excellent
strong
ale
half
a
550
ml
into
a
pint
glass
my
first
stingo
bottled
in
2010
so
a
few
years
on
it
from
open
pour
and
throughout
the
first
glass
the
aroma
is
amazing
very
precise
smell
wont

it
taste
is
so
mellow
and
sweet
very

not
much
to
not

about

overall
a
great
english
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
world
of
hop
centric
beers
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
not
much
more
toffee
vanilla
oak
raisiny
grape
date
cognac
fig
bready
malts
some
buttery
flavors
and
dried
tobacco
leaf
hearty
like
a
good
strong
english
ale
with
a
slurpy
mouthfeel
filled
with
textured
carbonation
delicious
plummy
flavors
add
to
the
sweeter
malt
notes
which
spring
up
everywhere
robust
and
not
candied
keeps
an
easier
drinkability
the
body
is
merely
medium
but
it
feels
a
bit
fuller
than
that
alcohol
tries
to
peak
but
the
aging
has
really
mellowed
that
out
this
drinks
great
and
i
recommend
laying
down
a
bottle
or
two
for
a
few
years
for
yourself
o
great
the
oak
aging
really
adds
depth
to
the
beer
i
must
say
i
was
very
impressed
with
complexity
of
this
ale
again
samuel
smiths
has
yet
to
disappoint
and
with
an
abv
of
8
this
ale
makes
a
great
addition
to
colder
months
of
the
year
o
a
definitive
english
strong
ale
rich
and
flavorful
with
a
damn
near
perfect
mouthfeel
and
that
lovely
touch
of
butter
common
to
many
a
british
ale
o
interesting
and
tasty
brew
lots
of
toffee
not
super
overpowering
just
the
dominant
flavor
pretty
decent
complexity
between
the
maltiness
and
the
oakiness
nice
balance
of
flavor
nothing
stupendous
but
probably
the
best
english
strong
ale
ive
ever
had
rjt
cheers
o
good
drinkability
another
british
masterpiece
from
samuel
smith
i
think
this
is
the
oldest
beer
ive
ever
imbibed
and
it
was
quite
quite
good
this
stingo
stuff
aint
too
shabby
the
taste
was
a
mild
plum
and
fig
overall
disappointing
the
bottle
was
brewed
in
2011
perhaps
a
fresher
bottle
would
have
better
the

dark

floral
hops
thru
the

followed
by
ripe

toward
the

yeast
and
fruit
flavors
are
similar
to

strong
dark
ale
but
not
as
prominent
finishes
incredibly
dry
with
lingering
floral
hop
and
dry
and
ripe
fruit
aftertaste
somehow
the
intense
maltiness
and
hop
character
subdue
the
booziness
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
i
always
wanted
them
to
do
something
bigger
than
a
5
not
knowing
this
was
out
there
and
now
i
know
what
it
would
taste
like
still
havent
tried
their
strawberry
or
fruit
stuff
but
im
afraid
ill
lose
the
respect
for
everything
ive
tasted
from
them
so
far
they
are
always
a
safe
goto
when
im
not
sure
what
i
feel
like
drinking
o
this
is
a
big
delicious
beer
very
complex
but
smooth
clean
and
refined
outstanding
overall
a
real
gem
a
delightful
ale
i
recommend
theres
a
nice
firm
malts
base
giving
this
beer
a
medium
body
that
doesnt
get
thinned
out
thoguh
a
bit
of
a
sting
hits
the
palate
its
pretty
smooth
with
a
little
something
to
the
feel
from
the
crispness
too
despite
the
sweetness
it
actually
goes
a
bit
dry
into
the
finish
which
is
surprising
sorry
sam
smith
still
love
ya
though
lighter
than
expected
and
lacking
distinct
flavors
or
notes
very
muddled
o
close
to
perfection
o
a
refined
strong
ale
overall
a
nice
evening
sipper
has
as
touch
of
elegance
to
it
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddishorange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
candied
fruit
aromas
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
sour
aroma
that
becomes
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
woody
flavor
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
better
smell
in
my
opinion
o
this
had
a
level
of
richness
to
it
that
many
of
the
imperial
stouts
i
had
that
day
lacked
its
not
super
easy
to
drink
and
its
kind
of
pricey
but
its
a
great
one
to
savor
slowly
o
phenomenal
blend
of
flavors
pretty
expensive
but
its
a
nice
treat
to
have
on
special
occasions
be
careful
with
the
pour
or
you
will
get
half
a
glass
of
frothy
loosely
knit
foam
mostly
medium
to
large
bubbles
which
is
sort
of
unusual
for
its
size
retention
is
excellent
and
it
simmers
down
at
a
slow
pace
as
a
result
though
the
lacing
is
close
to
nonexistent
first
because
theres
no
space
second
because
the
head
is
glued
together
so
tightly
the
liquid
is
a
cloudy
copper
red
hard
to
see
any
bubbles
captures
light
well
particularly
as
it
takes
on
a
more
orange
rust
to
clay
cast
near
the
glass
sides
the
nose
is
infused
with
vanillin
oak
and
toffee
molasses
notes
pralines
and
figs
just
short
of
dates
fruitcake
lightly
boozy
not
overly
roasted
and
actually
comes
out
on
the
demure
side
not
short
but
compact
in
the
mouth
its
close
to
fullbodied
and
super
creamy
in
texture
rises
to
coat
every
pore
in
your
mouth
that
noted
not
too
carbonated
and
theres
ample
opportunity
for
the
vanilla
caramel
caramelized
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
to
settle
in
not
that
sweet
indeed
finishes
on
the
dry
side
stays
in
the
range
of
fig
golden
raisin
dried
apples
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
no
perceptible
alcoholic
heat
tactful
without
impairing
your
ability
to
simply
enjoy
it
brewed
in
2011
it
was
somewhat
expensive
at
12
for
a
550ml
bottle
so
i
dont
know
that
ill
be
buying
regularly
but
im
glad
i
treated
myself
to
one
tonight
for
my
birthday
d
a
little
surprised
that
this
body
isnt
a
bit
fuller
however
still
plenty
of
aroma
and
flavor
carb
is
spot
on
nicely
done
with
the
bottle
conditioning
a
nice
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
if
i
went
into
it
without
any
expectations
i
would
have
been
better
off

possesses
all
the
best
characteristics
of
a
classic
english
winter
warmer
only
much
more
malty
and
with
a
smooth
oaky
character
it
isnt
cheap
but
its
well
worth
a
try
very
well
balanced
complex
and
smooth
flavor
with
a
silky
feeling
while
going
down
great
for
cold
weather
felt
nice
when
i
had
it
during
a
cold
day
in
trip
to
london
an
interesting
strong
ale
definitely
heavy
on
the
alcohol
flavor
but
with
an
equally
bold
malt
and
hop
bitterness
character
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
a
must
try
for
lovers
of
big
bold
ales
good
i
could
have
sworn
this
was
an
old
ale
im
not
sure
why
its
listed
as
an
english
strong
ale
it
certainly
tastes
like
an
old
ale
and
was
barrel
aged
for
a
year
the
primary
difference
i
noticed
was
that
it
was
the
best
old
ale
i
had
ever
tasted
this
thing
was
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
which
was
perfect
because
i
was
hungry
at
the
time
each
sip
was
like
the
next
bite
into
a
hamburger
it
was
quite
sweet
with
flavours
of
rotting
fruits
but
it
was
also
malty
and
earthy
at
the
same
time
but
not
in
a
sweet
belgian
brew
sort
of
way
it
was
a
tiny
bit
sour
like
someone
added
a
few
drops
of
warcestershire
sauce
into
the
beer
and
had
an
umami
flavour
to
it
as
well
these
are
really
what
distinguished
it
as
tasting
meallike
it
could
easily
vie
for
the
position
of
the
most
wellbalanced
highalcohol
sweet
beer
that
ive
ever
had
though
boulevards
dark
truth
and
probably
a
couple
others
would
still
provide
stiff
competition
this
beer
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
i
knew
it
must
be
good
but
it
was
absolutely
astounding
only
11
oz
of
it
really
made
my
night
i
have
has
this
bottle
in
the
cellar
for
about
2
years
and
the
extra
age
has
really
created
a
wondrous
beer
that
is
rounded
yet
full
of
flavour
the
young
stingo
was
a
bit
scattered
imo
but
i
loved
this
bottle
the
nose
is
full
of
hops
and
malt
but
you
can
tell
that
a
british
brewer
made
it
rather
than
the
new
world
hops
often
found
in
north
american
barley
wines
the
finish
is
long
and
very
smooth
but
i
never
felt
a
thinness
of
mouthfeel
in
this
beer
with
thomas
hardy
no
longer
made
this
might
be
my
favourite
british
barley
wine
overall
i
like
this
beer
this
aged
one
is
better
than
fresh
the
taste
is
powerful
with
a
barleymalted
sweetness
almost
akin
to
a
barleywine
toward
the
front
followed
by
a
shortlived
lingering
finish
this
tastes
good
now
but
it
is
one
of
those
beers
i
should
buy
now
and
stash
it
away
for
a
year
or
so
and
try
it
then
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
deep
rubyamber
coloring
with
a
thin
offwhite
ring
of
film
aromas
of
rich
dark
toffee
honey
sweetness
old
world
fruits
fig
and
date
foremost
and
some
earthy
overtones
flavors
are
bold
and
forward
on
a
surprisingly
thin
body
roasty
first
and
foremost
with
a
toffee
underlay
that
supports
the
earthy
old
world
fruit
sweetness
fig
raisin
and
date
all
impart
a
subtle
blending
of
rich
and
sweet
that
is
kept
balanced
by
the
clean
thin
body
oaky
highlights
also
add
a
rustic
feel
to
the
palate
smooth
rich
sweet
aftertaste
blending
all
of
the
fruit
and
earth
characteristics
into
a
nice
balanced
bouquet
smooth
clean
finish
that
is
light
and
only
slightly
lingering
great
cool
weather
sipping
beer
8
seemed
like
more
but
it
was
most
welcoming
o
its
nice
but
nothing
outstanding
a
very
rich
beer
one
that
is
best
enjoyed
in
small
doses
it
took
me
the
better
part
of
hour
to
work
through
my
bottle
and
even
then
i
ended
up
leaving
3
or
4
ounces
in
my
glass
just
too
much
of
a
good
thing
for
me
overall
this
has
become
one
of
my
new
favorites
just
picked
up
my
5th
and
6th
bottle
of
it
this
afternoon
this
beer
tastes
like
it
has
the
legs
to
last
a
couple
more
years
and
still
improve
would
definitely
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
or
6
of
these
its
typical
samuel
smith
quality
and
price
o
not
as
spectacular
as
i
was
expecting
but
very
well
made
and
quite
delicious
on
a
cold
evening
my
friend
thought
it
was
amazing
though
o
the
last
time
i
tried
a
samuel
smith
beer
was
6
months
ago
and
i
really
tasted
hard
water
on
this
beer
i
wish
the
beer
tasted
as
it
smelled
because
it
was
much
more
subtle
and
sweet
smelling
but
it
tastes
quite
dry
and
somewhat
harsh
in
comparison
o
a
great
holiday
beer
would
go
so
well
with
christmas
goose
or
a
thanksgiving
pumpkin
or
pecan
pie
this
is
a
real
treat
of
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavors
i
may
have
benefitted
from
this
being
an
aged
bottle
it
was
very
mellow
and
easydrinking
way
more
drinkable
than
i
remember
nice
o
excellent
brew
by
samuel
smith
i
had
been
searching
for
this
one
for
awhile
oi
really
like
this
beer
i
think
is
might
be
my
first
english
strong
ale
and
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
style
i
will
have
to
try
more
very
good
p
a
murky
dark
amber
copper
body
with
continents
of
bubbles
encompassing
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
puffy
layer
of
dark
khaki
head
that
quickly
escapes
into
the
murky
abyss
leaving
behind
a
khaki
swirl
o
this
reminds
me
of
sitting
around
a
warm
fire
in
the
woods
a
great
warming
sensation
and
a
very
well
hidden
abv
a
strong
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
complex
and
refined
i
have
instantly
became
a
fan
of
samuel
smith

some
what
sweet
but
also
refined
and
not
in
your
face
o
this
is
a
definite
goto
as
a
holiday
beer
or
a
fireside
sipper
there
are
elements
of
it
that
remind
me
of
a
good
whiskey
if
there
is
anything
really
to
critique
its
that
the
oak
comes
on
just
a
tad
too
strong
overall
good
never
had
another
of
the
style
so
its
tough
to
compare
nice
english
strong
ale
finally
got
to
try
this
after
hearing
alot
pours
a
beutiful
color
of
cherry
amber
colors
but
zerohead
retention
and
the
aromas
of
caramel
malts
were
faint
great
oaky
flavor
lots
of
caramel
but
not
much
else
its
a
solid
beer
but
the
oxidation
barrel
age
flavor
is
there
which
i
expected
from
a
long
barrel
aged
beer
apple
aciditc
type
flavors
on
the
back
its
solid
but
didnt
live
up
to
hype
id
be
happy
to
drink
any
time
but
wouldnt
seek
out
overall
an
excellent
sipper
abv
is
well
masked
with
little
or
no
warming
or
burning
as
a
side
note
too
much
sugar
and
not
enough
hops
to
be
called

this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
tiny

the
aroma
is
fantastic
its
full
of
fruits
caramel
oak
and
the
mineral
quality
that
threads
together
all
of
the
samuel
smiths
beers
the
taste
is
full
and
complex
with
bright
fruits
caramel
and
oak
comprising
the
bulk
of
the
taste
theres
a
slight
bit
of
roastiness
and
a
little
bit
of
sourness
as
well
a
whole
lot
of
everything
all
held
together
by
the
mineral
water
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
lightly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
and
interesting
ale
thats
worth
trying
for
fans
of
british
ales
o
complexly
delicious
yorkshire
stingo
is
just
what
i
thought
it
would
be
only
more
pungent
in
its
alcoholic
tendency
caskaged
british
ales
should
definitely
be
a
part
of
my
drinking
routine
from
now
on
on
ratebeer
com
this
beer
has
a
score
of
98
i
really
like
this
beer
when
im
not
having
a
hoppy
beer
this
would
currently
be
my
1st
choice
it
def
has
a
raisin
taste
but
not
overpowering
product
of
uk
etoh
8
aged
in
an
oak
casks
for
over
1
year
makes
this
beer
unique
i
havent
had
a
beer
similar
to
this
one
yet
i
bought
my
1
pint
bottle
at
whole
foods
for
12
99
my
whole
foods
is
close
to
churchky
so
they
def
have
a
great
selection
this
is
an
excellent
beer
overall
distinctly
unpleasant
beer
even
independently
of
the
price
brings
out
the
worst
aspects
of
both
belgian
and
english
brewing
didnt
really
get
a
sense
of
the
barrel
i
really
hated
this
beer
deeply
and
drainpoured
the
vast
majority
of
the
bottle
very
complex
nose
and
delicate
but
bold
malt
flavors
truly
enjoyable
d
more
balanced
than
expected
didnt
expect
this
almost
sour
raisin
vinous
like
note
at
all
lovely
sweetness
provides
excellent
complexity
dangerously
drinkable
o
a
really
amazing
beer
very
complex
and
kind
of
the
style
example
i
like
it
i
like
it
a
lot
samuel
smith
might
have
just
found
a
way
back
in
to
my
fridge
o
more
like
drinking
a
pudding
really
slightly
sweet
but
quite
decadent
slow
sipper
than
just
draws
you
in
even
though
slightly
thin
the
year
in
oak
casks
does
wonders
for
the
beer
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
nice
malty
complex
beer
that
being
said
it
was
hyped
up
a
lot
to
me
and
im
not
sure
if
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
expected
a
bigger
body
the
beer
seemed
thinned
out
with
maybe
sugar
not
sure
what
the
barrel
aging
is
doing
not
picking
up
a
lot
of
oak
or
wood
flavors
there
is
some
flavors
i
really
like
in
it
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
could
be
from
the
barrel
but
im
guessing
it
is
the
yeast
flavors
from
the
yorkshire
squares
really
worth
a
try
if
you
like
big
complex
malty
beers
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
present
and
helps
the
flow
of
things
but
doesnt
make
a
big
deal
of
itself
it
is
very
smooth
and
the
flavor
masks
the
9
abv
good
stuff
550
ml
bottle
from
voldby
købmandsgård
denmark
2009
brew
bb
june
2012
abv
is
9
copper
to
chestnut
coloured
beer
large
offwhite
head
strong
sweetish
malty
and
vinous
aroma
notes
of
raisins
caramel
and
oak
the
flavour
is
also
malty
oaky
and
vinous
with
notes
of
old
sherry
treacle
and
raisins
tolerable
hops
in
the
finish
harmonious
elegant
and
very
enjoyable
o
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
not
very
noticeable
in
the
taste
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
winter
day
the
bottle
i
tried
was
brewed
in
2010
o
yorkshire
stingo
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
hype
it
is
both
a
big
beer
and
light
and
refreshing
one
at
the
same
time
i
goes
down
smooth
each
and
is
as
close
to
a
true
to
a
traditional
style
british
as
you
can
get
o
its
nice
its
very
substantial
its
sweet
which
i
like
its
potent
and
makes
my
face
feel
good
and
warm
as
for
value
its
way
overpriced
i
paid
12
for
mine
for
one
18
7oz
bottle
not
worth
it
the
taste
is
very
good
but
not
interesting
enough
to
justify
paying
that
price
again
to
anyone
out
there
wondering
i
do
recommend
you
try
it
once
just
so
you
know
but
as
others
have
said
i
doubt
youll
buy
it
twice
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
complexity
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
samuel
smiths
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
they
did
not
disappoint
with
this
one
o
very
drinkable
but
not
complex
i
like
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
another
bottle
more
than
probably
any
ale
in
memory
this
seems
meant
to
be
sampled
as
warm
as
possible
this
would
maybe
benefit
from
an
additional
year
or
two
of
aging
provided
it
started
clean
of
course
what
is
happening
that
a
9
ale
is
becoming
infected
an
early
invasion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
to
have
while
celebrating
the
holidays
with
friends
and
family
as
it
is
essentially
fruitcake
in
a
glass
should
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
turns
out
after
some
time
in
the
cellar
one
of
those
times
when
expectation
exceeded
the
reality
no
matter
how
much
i
may
have
wanted
a
deeply
intoxicating
experience
of
the
senses
theres
a
nice
deep
brown
colour
to
the
eye
some
malty
medicinal
caramel
notes
to
the
nose
and
tongue
and
a
suprising
zing
too
but
the
yeast
is
really
miscast
and
the
mediumish
body
just
struggles
to
deal
with
all
that
weight
and
content
disappointing
considering
i
was
really
expecting
epicness
though
any
uk
ba
who
doubts
the
quality
of
sam
smiths
products
must
feel
vindicated
by
this
notes
drinks
like
a
fortified
wine
complex
woody
fruity
a
sipper
a
winter
warmer
i
think
its
a
good
idea
to
drink
this
slightly
below
room
temperature
but
much
cooler
than
that
and
youd
miss
out
on
a
lot
of
the
interesting
flavors
overall
this
is
a
fine
british
strong
ale
its
just
slightly
sweeter
than
i
had
hoped
but
well
worth
the
price
i
have
to
wonder
what
setting
aside
a
bottle
or
two
in
a
cool
dark
place
could
do
to
enhance
things
a
bit
further
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
strong
ale
o
nice
beer
i
want
to
try
another
one
that
has
a
bit
less
age
personally
i
rate
this
as
a
very
good
beerit
tastes
like
a
wellaged
strong
beer
ive
cellared
many
a
strong
ale
and
many
have
come
out
far
worse
than
this
very
good
addition
to
the
sam
smith
lineup
notes
hurt
by
hype
and
surely
by
the
stingo
of
the
price
plenty
more
outside
that
will
jump
ahead
of
this
one
in
terms
of
pq
ratio
it
has
a
nice
flow
strong
english
ale
old
ale
kind
of
thing
but
was
a
bit
subdued
if
reliable
given
the
overhyped
expectations
finsh
aftertaste
that
lingers
just
long
enough
for
my
tongue
to
say
take
another
sip
i
looked
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
a
while
having
seen
it
advertised
last
year
but
unable
to
find
it
its
initial
batch
appears
to
have
been
made
in
limited
supply
now
having
had
the
opportunty
to
have
had
a
try
ill
be
heading
out
to
the
store
tomorrow
for
more
if
theres
any
left
if
you
like
the
warmth
of
alcohol
and
scotch
by
all
mean
try
this
beer
pricey
at
11
00
but
worth
it
one
last
note
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
nov
2011
the
lable
says
its
8
abv
description
above
says
9
abv
abv
may
have
changed
between
2010
2011
take
note
d
i
accidentally
purchased
this
it
was
rather
tasty
but
a
bit
pricier
than
i
would
have
liked
traditional
old
world
oak
treatments
sure
seem
laid
back
compared
to
upstart
new
world
versions
and
those
who
would
emulate
them
wow
where
have
i
heard
that
before
cough
australian
cough
red
wine
wheeze
anyways
this
is
a
lovely
warming
but
not
boozy
strong
ale
lots
going
on
with
the
native
grain
and
piled
on
further
in
the
barrel
exposure
its
quite
nice
to
be
able
once
in
a
while
to
say
that
the
dear
sticker
price
was
surely
worth
it
o
one
the
whole
this
is
a
solid
wellmade
beer
drinkable
the
appearance
was
a
dark
hazelhead
punyadmit
poor
bad
good
aromasweet
fruitybread
odor
with
a
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
similarreminded
me
of
a
quad
maybe
its
considered
a
quad
for
all
i
knowbut
not
as
flavorful
good
sensationtingles
as
it
goes
down
definitely
would
have
again
especially
with
the
right
foods
overall
this
is
a
real
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
it
is
working
well
on
a
cold
night
like
tonight
for
me
not
crazy
about
this
one
but
it
is
a
very
solids
brew
o
a
delicious
warming
ale
another
win
for
samuel
smith
overall
this
is
a
good
complex
beer
i
enjoyed
reading
about
the
production
and
extensive
aging
but
at
10
99
per
bottle
im
not
sure
how
often
i
will
be
revisiting
it
o
an
interesting
brew
pretty
sour
and
zesty
odd
a
bit
intense
needs
to
warm
up
a
bit
before
it
really
hits
its
prime
i
think
gonna
age
a
bottle
for
a
year
and
see
where
we
end
up
o
this
is
a
top
shelf
brew
albeit
a
little
pricey
overall
loved
the
beer
but
hated
the
price
11
99
for
550ml
of
beer
wont
be
visiting
this
one
again
anytime
soon
or
at
least
until
my
wallet
grows
this
brew
had
been
one
that
i
wanted
to
try
for
quite
some
time
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
red
color
with
a
fizzy
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
head
quickly
vanishes
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
the
smell
is
of
some
soft
earthy
notes
nothing
too
extreme
here
i
expected
the
smell
to
be
much
stronger
than
it
was
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
not
sour
like
i
expected
there
is
some
semisweet
caramel
flavors
with
some
earthy
malts
and
a
light
wooden
barrel
flavor
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
has
a
pretty
good
body
to
it
the
carbonation
isnt
too
bad
overall
this
brew
wasnt
as
good
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
its
a
decent
brew
but
im
struggling
a
little
bit
to
see
the
hype
o
the
overall
mellow
sweetness
and
light
carbonation
cover
the
alcohol
making
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
even
at
9
abv
overall
i
got
another
one
of
these
and
im
going
to
try
it
in
a
few
days
or
weeks
if
its
different
than
i
will
know
it
was
just
that
one
bottle
if
not
then
this
beer
brewed
in
2010
definitely
lost
its
carbonation
over
time
maybe
not
but
the
stingo
ate
my
beer
allowance
i
did
not
realize
the
price
until
i
checked
out
but
this
thing
was
12
compared
to
4
or
5
for
most
sam
smith
brews
at
least
in
san
antonio
i
realize
this
is
more
of
a
commentary
than
a
review
so
i
will
say
this
i
was
immensely
disappointed
although
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
expecting
more
barrel
to
come
through
but
sammy
didnt
hit
the
mark
o
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
dark
belgian
and
a
glass
of
port
definitely
has
a
uniqueness
about
it
was
a
tad
on
the
pricey
side
but
i
deserve
it
i
only
picked
this
one
up
because
it
was
5
99
normal
price
is
13
99
i
really
doubt
id
pay
14
for
this
but
its
definitely
worth
it
for
6
the
7up
comparison
is
not
unfounded
as
theres
a
residual
sweetness
to
this
beer
as
well
nothing
as
syrupysugary
as
a
pop
however
its
more
of
a
mellow
malty
flavor
with
only
the
slightest
bit
of
oakwood
this
was
a
curiosity
pick
that
wasnt
worth
the
price
overall
nice
and
strong
beer
from
sammy
smith
has
alcohol
backbone
which
im
not
used
to
from
sammy
smith
this
beer
totally
reminds
me
of
a
old
ale
the
oak
fruits
caramel
and
its
tasty
its
a
little
sweeter
then
i
figured
it
would
be
but
not
overpowering
a
sipper
and
this
bottle
is
enough
for
one
sitting
conclusion
i
hoped
that
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
a
i
enjoy
the
idea
of
it
and
i
wasnt
let
down
i
love
this
beer
it
is
mellow
and
complex
and
wonderfully
subtle
aged
strong
ales
from
england
are
for
me
some
of
the
most
pleasing
drinkable
liquids
on
this
planet
and
this
beer
is
one
of
the
greats
for
me
it
trounces
j
w
lees
because
it
doesnt
sway
to
far
into
the
syrupysweetheadache
area
although
i
respect
that
as
i
know
many
people
love
it
thomas
hardys
still
holds
the
gold
medal
in
my
book
but
this
fullers
vintage
ale
and
fullers
1845
are
all
solid
alternatives
which
are
still
produced
overall
the
best
sam
smiths
i
have
had
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
is
very
well
put
together
and
quite
tasty
but
perhaps
my
favorite
aspect
of
it
is
that
i
am
hardly
able
to
perceive
any
of
its
considerable
strength
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
even
as
it
warms
definitely
the
best
offering
i
have
had
from
samuel
smiths
o
a
tasty
beverage
its
a
little
steep
in
price
but
im
pleased
o
not
the
best
beer
i
have
had
but
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
english
strong
ale
right
up
there
with
fullers
vintage
ale
and
without
a
doubt
the
best
i
have
had
from
samuel
smith
i
can
see
this
being
a
great
warmersipper
for
a
drab
and
cold
night
or
a
special
occasion
excellent
and
highly
recommend
everything
about
this
beer
screams
unique
so
for
that
i
rate
it
highly
its
a
tad
to
sweet
for
me
but
so
interesting
that
i
cant
stop
sipping
it
the
oak
aging
has
done
so
well
to
calm
the
fruits
down
that
this
beer
is
a
need
to
buy
if
seen
i
think
i
got
lucky
in
randomly
finding
it
one
day
definitely
worth
a
shot
or
two
o
very
nice
a
sipper
but
good
through
the
whole
bottle
edit
not
really
finishes
like
a
snickers
bar
yummers
o
while
this
isnt
the
best
beer
out
there
the
nose
and
flavors
are
pretty
complex
due
to
the
oak
aging
i
wouldnt
spend
the
9
again
but
i
would
recommend
it
o
a
very
nice
beer
indeed
but
not
one
for
every
day
now
that
ive
drunk
half
the
550ml
bottle
in
order
to
review
it
im
getting
out
the
cheese
and
some
crusty
bread
to
go
with
the
rest
of
it
incredibly
wellbalanced
had
to
save
my
nickels
but
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
fairly
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
an
excellent
brew
by
almost
any
standard
highly
recommend
o
this
is
good
quality
beer
ill
definitely
look
for
this
again
a
very
nice
ale
indeed
this
is
one
i
have
eyeballed
for
quite
some
time
but
the
normal
11
price
tag
always
kept
me
away
however
as
soon
as
it
went
on
sale
i
had
to
pick
up
at
least
one
and
now
that
ive
tried
this
delicious
brew
ill
be
back
for
more
d
very
complex
and
tasty
i
love
all
the
fruits
present
this
is
very
dry
the
other
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
and
provide
plenty
of
taste
while
not
being
powerful
in
the
true
english
ale
style
o
overall
quite
good
the
alcohol
is
barely
present
which
at
9
abv
makes
this
a
little
dangerous
if
youre
not
paying
attention
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
i
split
a
550
ml
lousy
brits
probably
7030
with
my
wife
and
was
able
to
knock
back
my
13
oz
or
so
pretty
quick
so
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
as
the
carbonation
dies
down
and
the
glass
warms
up
it
feels
less
like
a
beer
and
more
like
a
nice
brandy
a
very
nice
surprise
with
this
beer
this
was
the
only
sam
smith
i
had
yet
to
try
their
oatmeal
stout
got
me
on
to
the
style
i
like
this
one
its
good
its
all
there
but
i
suppose
not
as
pronounces
as
id
like
it
to
be
something
leaves
me
wanting
more
perhaps
the
lacking
finish
for
an
ale
like
this
i
want
the
gooey
comforting
caramel
fig
to
sit
with
me
at
the
back
of
the
palate
for
some
time
after
a
gulp
instead
the
bitterness
is
there
with
just
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
holding
on
ahh
its
pleasing
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
quite
so
i
dont
get
this
beer
at
all
the
oak
flavors
are
off
putting
the
hops
and
the
malt
dont
work
at
all
with
this
oak
i
would
like
to
read
what
others
think
but
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
worst
uses
of
oak
ive
had
as
it
warms
it
just
is
too
sweet
and
the
oak
doesnt
work
anymore
than
to
start
i
dont
get
this
love
at
all
value
is
a
part
of
this
score
at
12
bucks
it
really
doesnt
help
anything
overall
just
a
whit
shy
of
an
english
barleywine
this
is
an
excellent
brew
that
has
a
lot
of
complexity
o
loved
the
oak
and
was
surprised
by
the
nose
o
the
nose
was
a
major
turnoff
but
the
complex
flavor
profile
roped
me
back
in
after
a
few
sips
the
flavors
in
my
mouth
started
to
come
through
more
intensely
in
the
nose
and
it
lost
most
of
its
bandaid
character
which
made
it
much
easier
to
drink
bottle
note
this
was
brewed
in
2009
and
aged
in
oak
casks
for
over
a
year
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
for
an
occasional
drink
im
new
to
the
style
so
i
have
no
others
to
compare
with
at
this
time
but
it
was
delicious
and
warming
nice
beer
thick
and
creamy
with
great
level
of
carbonation
good
complexity
with
layers
of
toffee
malt
oak
vanilla
date
fig
raisin
and
prune
slightly
dry
finish
with
decent
length
sharp
and
brisk
malts
with
a
bit
of
acidity
in
the
middle
easy
sipper
drinkability
another
solid
effort
from
sam
smiths
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
for
sipping
it
filled
me
up
so
the
drinkability
is
not
as
high
as
some
others
from
the
brewery
rather
sweet
also
i
would
have
it
again
with
ease
but
its
not
a
brew
i
would
want
on
a
regular
basis
a
few
times
a
year
would
be
nice
though
its
worth
a
try
its
a
pretty
good
beer
you
wont
find
me
complaining
anytime
i
have
one
of
these
to
drink
interesting
but
not
quite
where
i
would
have
liked
it
could
actually
use
more
rich
malt
character
here
as
the
oak
really
seems
to
dominate
the
flavor
a
bit
more
than
i
would
prefer
not
bad
and
certainly
worth
finishing
if
you
are
happy
with
just
having
a
beer
and
it
is
not
like
this
doesnt
have
some
interesting
flavors
in
it
though
this
is
an
awesome
sipping
beerdelicious
and
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
of
this
heft
love
it
o
really
good
this
is
a
great
english
strong
pours
a
dense
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
which
recedes
rather
quickly
but
does
leave
lace
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
nose
hits
with
a
maltyoaky
bomb
of
white
raisin
and
baked
fruits
with
numerous
bourbon
spice
and
ripe
tropical
notes
throughout
the
palate
starts
as
a
splended
malty
mix
of
italian
christmas
panettone
and
caramel
latte
leading
to
an
oaky
dryness
before
finishing
sweet
again
with
butterscotch
and
nutty
notes
highly
complex
and
wonderfully
sweet
drinkability
i
thought
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
the
ale
was
thin
and
the
booze
overpowering
and
onedimensional
o
complex
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
at
least
68
months
its
15
but
well
worth
the
price
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
just
so
spectacular
and
wellbalanced
that
i
couldnt
wait
until
my
next
one
as
soon
as
i
finished
the
first
the
barrelaging
imparts
less
of
a
flavor
than
in
others
and
it
blends
perfectly
with
the
deep
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
the
complex
character
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
can
see
being
the
perfect
choice
for
any
season
or
mood
i
was
expecting
viscous
but
this
beer
has
a
lighter
mouthfeel
than
that
but
its
still
mouth
filling
im
amazed
at
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
at
9
and
i
should
stop
this
review
before
my
spelling
really
takes
a
downslide
im
wishing
the
bottle
was
a
wee
bit
smaller
because
i
will
drink
the
whole
thing
pours
a
bright
copper
color
eggshell
colored
head
which
diminishes
fairly
fast
to
a
thin
creamy
surface
swirl
the
smell
is
incredible
malts
and
sweet
sweet
caramel
taste
is
a
little
boozy
but
the
caramel
brown
sugar
and
malt
come
through
nicely
little
to
no
hop
taste
but
slight
bitterness
to
offset
the
malty
profile
the
booziness
made
it
a
little
hard
to
do
more
than
sip
but
it
was
a
fine
sip
id
buy
this
one
again
d
man
if
i
ever
saw
this
in
a
store
at
a
reasonable
price
68
dollars
i
would
pick
it
up
so
quickly
sadly
the
only
place
close
by
is
trying
to
squeeze
12
dollars
a
bottle
for
the
rarity
another
solid
brew
by
samuel
smith
thanks
again
onedropsoup
for
the
amazing
beer
what
a
great
beer
poured
a
massive
3
head
which
was
slow
to
dissipate
hazy
light
brown
color
quite
nice
smell
with
malt
and
caramel
taste
has
that
again
plus
a
tart
zing
and
a
sort
of
raisin
or
fig
fruitiness
i
respect
the
tradition
behind
the
way
it
was
brewed
in
stone
yorkshire
squares
and
then
aged
a
couple
of
years
a
unique
dark
beer
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
sa
perfect
pint
glass
i
was
surprised
the
beer
pours
a
deep
garnet
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
oak
and
molasses
lots
of
oak
up
front
dates
and
some
booze
the
finish
is
drying
the
body
is
medium
nice
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
worth
pursuing
you
gotta
try
somethin
that
goes
by
the
name
of
stingo
sounds
like
some
crappy
spaghetti
western
from
the
70s
it
pours
though
a
lightly
hazed
russetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
chocolate
walnut
oak
and
flowers
the
taste
hold
notes
of
toffee
caramel
wood
and
greens
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
bit
o
britishness
nuff
said
d
medium
overall
flavorful
and
interesting
but
too
mild
to
be
great
a
nice
complex
old
ale
but
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
especially
with
such
a
high
price
feels
very
thick
and
rich
not
the
easiest
to
get
down
but
not
bad
by
any
means
just
a
very
unsessionable
beer
that
is
good
but
just
not
my
thing
d
not
sure
why
this
one
is
so
talked
up
i
thought
it
was
pretty
mediocre
d
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
tag
decently
drinkable
at
9
d
this
one
has
lots
in
common
with
a
barleywine
i
think
it
was
just
ok
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
drop
another
13
on
a
second
bottle
pretty
mediocre
if
you
ask
me
too
strong
to
consider
having
another
one
d
wow
all
of
the
notes
blend
together
so
well
in
this
delicious
and
complex
brew
i
wish
sam
smith
took
more
chances
like
this
deep
malty
sweetness
breadcrust
date
raisin
and
a
whole
oak
tree
ok
not
that
oaky
an
easy
9
to
drink
for
sure
quaffable
while
hearty
and
thoroughly
delicious
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
malty
with
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
the
appearance
is
hazy
medium
brown
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
average
overall
a
good
beer
that
somehow
doesnt
score
that
high
it
just
seems
rather
good
at
first
and
declines
with
time
i
am
a
big
fan
of
other
samuel
smith
beers
and
the
stingo
is
perhaps
the
best
of
the
bunch
d
really
dug
this
for
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
but
it
started
to
get
a
little
tiresome
after
i
think
this
may
be
due
to
the
weight
of
it
overall
a
really
nice
brew
from
sam
smith
d
each
sip
left
me
wanting
another
you
could
get
a
little
full
on
this
one
but
it
is
very
drinkable
absurdly
drinkable
for
the
9
abv
with
loads
of
character
and
depth
there
should
be
three
in
your
beer
cellar
to
surprise
the
next
three
guests
in
your
home
who
have
not
tried
this
beer
yet
cheers
d
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
one
that
im
surprised
sam
smith
makes
this
is
a
big
beer
with
a
lot
of
good
flavors
working
together
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
worth
picking
up
sometime
to
give
it
a
try
mouthfeel
is
intermediate
with
a
nice
amount
of
natural
carbonation
there
is
absolutely
no
sign
of
this
thing
being
9
abv
so
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
the
most
exciting
beer
ive
had
from
the
uk
since
meantime
ipa
highly
recommended
asked
for
and
received
a
bottle
of
this
one
as
a
christmas
gift
after
reading
an
awesome
review
poured
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
big
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
oak
leather
dark
fruits
and
wine
soaked
wood
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
slightly
tart
with
nice
vinuous
flavors
figs
plums
oak
and
caramel
a
very
good
beer
this
is
admittedly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
at
8abv
it
really
isnt
a
session
beer
but
its
my
favorite
session
beer
this
beer
has
a
very
pronounced
oak
character
malty
but
the
sweetness
isnt
derived
solely
from
it
finishes
clean
not
boozy
very
slight
warming
sensation
slightly
tart
as
it
warms
up
love
the
caramel
and
toffee
notes
thats
why
i
have
a
case
of
it
in
my
basement
wish
it
cost
a
lot
less
mfd
slightly
creamy
and
very
smooth
went
down
well
dispite
the
9abv
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
oaky
and
light
bourbon
like
notes
in
the
taste
vanilla
oaky
light
bourbon
notes
without
the
burn
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
hint
of
oak
and
vanilla
nice
oak
and
like
the
bourbon
notes
without
the
burn
it
lacks
depth
but
does
hide
the
alcohol
well
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
in
that
ive
enjoyed
sipping
my
way
through
it
and
id
certainly
be
willing
to
have
it
again
that
said
it
is
a
good
but
not
a
great
beer
so
in
this
case
im
not
likely
to
buy
it
all
that
often
at
11
per
500
ml
verdict
very
good
and
worth
tracking
down
most
folks
myself
included
probably
dont
know
that
stingo
is
an
older
word
that
means
old
ale
or
old
beer
seems
appropriate
for
this
beer
which
is
apparently
aged
for
an
entire
year
in
samuel
smiths
famous
yorkshire
squares
im
using
a
goblet
for
this
one
tonight
as
a
special
beer
deserves
a
special
glass
pours
a
murky
and
ruddy
amber
carbonation
levels
are
pretty
high
as
theres
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
popping
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
no
real
head
on
this
beer
just
bubbles
on
the
outer
rim
of
the
glass
aroma
is
rich
deep
and
pungent
you
can
really
pick
out
the
oak
which
adds
a
nice
earth
characteristic
the
first
taste
is
simply
incredible
flavor
profile
is
stunningly
complex
with
loads
of
molasses
dark
cherry
raisin
oak
and
tobacco
clamoring
for
attention
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
the
mouthfeel
balanced
as
the
heavy
flavor
profile
and
malt
profile
could
easily
become
syrupy
if
left
alone
happily
thats
not
the
case
here
though
the
heavy
alcohol
warmth
makes
this
a
sipping
beer
samuel
smiths
has
done
it
again
creating
a
textbook
example
of
a
classic
english
style
in
the
case
of
yorkshire
stingo
the
old
ale
highly
recommended
tasty
at
times
overbearing
at
others
drinkability
suffers
due
to
harshness
nice
carbonation
want
to
go
back
for
another
drink
to
find
more
flavors
drinkability
fantastic
not
one
i
can
have
too
many
of
just
because
of
the
9
alcohol
but
id
recommend
it
im
glad
to
have
tried
a
english
strong
ale
poured
a
translucent
hazelnut
brown
with
a
good
finger
of
foamy
offwhite
head
that
laced
and
retained
well
sugary
notes
of
leather
and
molasses
with
a
good
dose
of
toasted
malts
toffee
and
caramel
up
front
with
the
alcohol
warmth
right
in
the
middle
and
a
nutty
tobaccolike
finish
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
that
fades
quickly
yet
retains
well
enough
to
give
a
trademark
english
bite
to
it
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
may
not
be
a
true
everyday
staple
for
me
not
because
its
bad
but
because
of
personal
preference
still
an
awesome
beer
for
those
who
take
interest
in
traditionalstyle
beers
picked
this
up
at
stew
leonards
in
clifton
nj
brewed
in
2009
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
frothy
cream
colored
head
great
retention
smell
very
fruity
sweet
raisins
plums
burned
sugar
taste
sweet
bready
malts
up
front
then
sweet
like
a
fruit
cake
finished
with
some
roasted
barley
dryness
very
complex
fantastic
winter
beer
scarily
smooth
and
drinkable
for
9
abv
definitely
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
stingo
unmistakeably
english
in
its
character
and
exhibiting
such
a
fine
balance
of
esbesque
bitterness
with
a
splendid
dessert
quality
this
poured
a
nice
and
thick
orange
beige
head
that
slowly
became
non
existent
unless
swirled
again
it
smelled
of
toffee
and
dark
fruit
with
a
slight
hint
of
earthiness
and
alcohol
the
most
prominent
flavor
was
the
toffee
flavor
a
hint
of
raisin
and
a
oakysmokey
flavor
like
tobacco
and
leather
at
the
finish
it
felt
great
in
the
mouth
and
went
down
easy
leaving
the
alcohol
presence
behind
jake
an
all
around
good
beer
this
isnt
the
homerun
that
i
had
been
hearing
about
it
but
it
is
a
good
beer
for
the
price
though
i
would
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
overall
pretty
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
notes
bottle
clearly
says
8
abv
in
a
couple
spots
not
the
9
thats
currently
listed
here
but
still
its
ridiculously
tasty
way
too
much
goodness
mmmm
give
me
more
give
me
more
give
me
more
quite
nice
pours
a
murky
honey
brown
color
with
a
smallish
airy
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
has
some
pruney
notes
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
nothing
mind
altering
here
the
flavor
is
definitely
more
bold
there
is
a
big
prune
presence
the
malt
is
bready
but
fairly
unassuming
there
is
some
honey
and
other
nondescript
fruity
flavors
there
is
some
slight
dry
oaky
flavors
but
they
are
very
subtle
compared
to
some
of
those
oak
aged
monsters
out
there
the
prune
and
oak
actually
blend
to
a
very
smooth
and
mellow
flavor
the
feel
is
moderate
with
spritzy
carbonation
abv
well
hidden
drinks
and
finishes
sweet
perhaps
a
tad
dry
from
the
oak
a
subtle
yet
tasty
brew
nothing
earth
shattering
but
the
flavor
profile
works
so
it
drinks
quite
well
a
lovely
creation
herekudos
to
samuel
smith
for
making
us
beer
geeks
happy
yet
again
this
is
a
yearly
release
so
hunt
this
one
down
and
cellar
a
bottle
or
two
for
the
hell
of
it
into
the
snifta
yorkshire
spits
forth
a
dirty

faucet
water

with
some

some

nuts

whispers
and
a
hint
of
oakwood
a
first
time
with
this
type
of
barrel
beer
barrels
but
it
comes
off
old
world
style
which
i
dig
feel
is
mediumish
with
the
slightest
carb
to
keep
it
alive
i
drank
the
whole
thing
mommy
ima
pick
up
more
while
the
getting
is
good
d
very
drinkable
i
could
have
these
all
of
the
time
clear
dark
reddish
color
under
a
solid
sticky
tan
head
that
lasts
as
a
creamy
ring

ripe

brown

and
a
little
sting
of
alcohol
beautifully
smooth

rich

dried

tea
a
slight
dry
hit
of

still
a
touch
of
leafy
hop
bitterness
all
very
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
satisfying
dryness
at
the
end
of
every
sip
really
nice
curious
to
how
this
one
ages
it
might
smooth
it
out
even
more
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
of
sour
cherries
taste
is
a
tart
and
sour
fruit
up
front
with
a
hint
of
bread
in
the
middle
and
a
earthy
mouth
puckering
finish
a
taste
of
butter
is
present
as
well
mouthfeel
is
rich
nice
low
carbonation
good
drinkability
i
was
not
tired
of
the
beer
by
the
end
of
the
glass
though
the
price
is
insanely
high
over
10
dollars
i
doubt
i
will
get
this
again
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
no
trace
of
the
increased
abv
and
especially
tasty
beer
for
the
size
of
the
head
and
the
overall
malty
ale
character
this
beer
is
almost
belgianesque
in
many
ways
the
body
is
shockingly
thin
perhaps
served
in
a
cask
this
is
a
marvel
of
beer
antitechnology
but
from
the
bottle
fizzles
just
a
touch
still
wonderfully
fine
drinking
and
recommended
for
europeanbeer
fans
of
more
than
just
the
english
stripe
d
quite
enjoyable
malt
and
caramel
with
some
nice
oak
notes
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
very
tasty
nothing
like
the
watneys
stingo
of
old
the
color
is
a
particularly
refractive
cognacamber
and
there
are
esters
of
raisin
plum
cherry
treacle
toffee
vanilla
plum
pudding
in
hard
sauce
and
oak
the
body
is
medium
and
oily
and
the
flavor
and
carbonation
are
very
soft
its
a
sweet
brew
on
balance
but
never
cloying
with
just
enough
flowery
hop
dryness
in
the
finish
and
a
lot
of
finesse
samual
smiths
yorkshire
stingo
aged
in
100
year
old
oak
barrels
for
a
year
pours
a
hazed
ruby
in
color
with
little
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
i
am
immediately
greeted
with
a
complex
aroma
of
oak
cedar
malt
and
a
distant
fruityness
in
the
flavor
english
ale
yeast
with
all
due
fruityness
and
faintly
tart
oak
adds
a
subtle
wood
flavor
to
the
beer
coupled
with
a
moreish
finish
makes
this
a
fine
drinking
experience
this
is
a
lovely
beer
one
of
samuel
smiths
best
and
thats
saying
something
it
has
all
the
big
flavoursome
characteristics
you
expect
in
a
strong
ale
but
done
with
all
the
subtlety
and
selfeffacing
nature
that
an
english
ale
provides
gorgeous
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
and
not
as
robustgrounded
as
id
hoped
for
but
it
is
complex
and
i
feel
like
by
the
time
im
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
after
its
warmed
a
bit
some
different
impressions
will
shine
through
and
another
bottle
a
year
down
the
road
will
likely
be
quite
different
than
this
stingo
is
a
beer
to
practice
vertical
tastings
with
no
doubt
this
is
a
real
nice
beer
but
one
is
enough
to
my
tastes
though
if
it
tasted
quite
as
good
as
it
smelled
i
would
probably
be
stocking
up
right
away
pours
with
a
large
beige
head
that
lingers
for
a
long
while
hazy
deep
honey
copper
color
strong
aroma
of
apples
granny
smith
and
raisons
and
prunes
taste
is
almost
like
a
mellow
port
or
fortified
wine
but
kinder
on
the
pallate
and
much
more
easier
to
drink
than
a
fortified
wine
im
not
overwelmed
or
overpowered
by
the
8
0
alcohol
which
is
a
really
good
thing
because
i
dont
generally
like
real
boozy
beers
this
is
a
cool
weather
warmer
too
i
am
drinking
my
stingo
at
around
4550
degrees
f
and
its
making
me
warm
at
this
temperature
many
new
layers
of
flavors
like
tea
and
pure
vanilla
extract
surprise
my
taste
buds
i
wasnt
sure
id
ever
find
a
bottle
of
stingo
ive
been
searching
up
and
down
the
east
coast
us
for
several
months
but
i
finally
found
it
in
baltimore
last
week
if
you
enjoy
a
complex
and
rich
full
bodied
beer
experience
stingo
is
worth
hunting
for
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
good
fine
carbonation
this
beer
feels
very
nice
on
the
palate
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
on
this
one
and
at
8
abv
it
goes
down
probably
too
smoothly
nice
and
smooth
low
natural
carbonation
let
this
one
warm
a
bit
and
its
very
nice
my
bottling
was
9
abv
and
you
can
feel
it
my
hope
was
that
yorkshire
stingo
would
give
fullers
vintage
ale
a
run
for
its
english
big
beer
money
twas
not
to
be
the
fullers
beer
is
amazing
and
is
well
worth
the
purchase
price
this
one
is
merely
good
and
is
surpassed
by
any
number
of
samuel
smith
old
brewery
offerings
well
done
jd
i
find
drinkability
to
be
easy
in
my
opinion
it
has
similar
qualities
of
an
old
ale
there
are
only
2000
cases
shipped
worldwide
a
year
so
if
you
see
one
buy
it
taste
is
spicey
fruits
up
front
rich
and
complex
with
caramelised
fruits
leafytoasty
after
the
upfront
sweetspicey
fruitiness
then
more
leafytoasty
character
faint
woodiness
growing
by
the
finish
full
rich
maltiness
is
balanced
with
nice
hop
character
and
it
finishes
balanced
and
dryish
feel
and
body
are
full
and
slightly
oily
but
not
heavy
slick
or
truly
oily
it
is
very
smooth
and
yet
complex
picks
up
a
bit
of
bite
as
it
reaches
room
temperature
but
up
until
that
point
its
a
great
old
ale
full
of
character
and
depth
masking
the
high
alcohol
well
and
having
it
work
to
its
advantage
expensive
but
worth
picking
a
bottle
up
if
you
can
beer
is
kind
of
oddly
bitter
almost
tannic
its
a
big
beer
just
like
the
other
one
but
its
slightly
more
watery
interesting
mouthfeel
overall
its
got
some
lead
off
sweetness
and
some
a
little
bit
of
fruit
flavors
in
the
midpalate
comparing
it
to
the
1845
its
not
as
flavorful
and
slightly
less
body
both
are
good
but
imo
1845
is
better
i
would
drink
this
again
but
its
so
high
in
alcohol
its
not
a
recreation
drink
generally
sam
smith
wont
let
you
down
and
this
is
yet
another
example
of
a
solid
english
ale
would
be
interested
to
have
this
on
cask
someday
overall
i
was
dissappointed
in
this
offering
nothing
really
stood
out
as
great
and
the
blend
of
flavors
seemed
inconsistent
for
the
price
tag
this
was
one
and
done
for
me
d
this
beer
is
interestingly
odd
all
of
the
off
flavors
seem
purposeful
and
work
together
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
little
more
malt
flavor
to
add
to
the
buttery
cidery
cherry
oxidized
flavors
this
is
a
quarky
brew
that
taste
like
a
historic
artifact
dyes
drinks
i
was
recommended
this
by
someone
whose
beer
knowledge
i
greatly
respect
but
i
cant
see
the
allure
i
can
think
of
several
better
strong
ales
drinkabilitydrinking
it
more
slowly
than
i
could
to
savor
the
flavors
and
that
glorious
aftertaste
but
its
a
struggle
to
wait
between
sips
gotta
rate
this
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
overall
a
fantastic
beer
i
need
to
go
out
and
get
some
more
drinkability
the
enjoyable
dark
sweet
fruit
flavors
are
nicely
paired
with
the
subtle
bitter
finish
this
really
is
something
that
can
only
be
enjoyed
slowly
i
love
samuel
smith
beers
but
the
10
dollar
price
tag
has
kept
me
away
from
this
beer
but
while
visiting
a
friend
in
michigan
i
found
a
retailer
selling
it
off
for
4
99
a
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
dense
somewhat
dusty
brown
head
of
foam
the
nose
is
strong
almost
brandylike
the
alcohol
is
evident
smelling
of
cherries
plums
and
raisins
there
is
a
little
sourness
going
on
with
the
oak
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
very
complex
nose
suggesting
a
heavy
warming
brew
the
taste
and
body
of
this
beer
was
crazy
one
of
the
few
brews
ive
had
that
didnt
drink
the
way
it
smelled
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
that
characteristic
samuel
smith
fruitiness
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
toffee
some
sourness
a
good
vanillamellowness
from
the
oak
all
around
a
very
drinkable
not
to
heavy
complex
brew
that
hide
its
8
percent
alcohol
quite
well
i
could
of
easily
drank
this
beer
all
night
glad
i
got
it
for
the
price
i
did
but
i
would
defiantly
purchase
this
beer
again
at
regular
price
wish
i
would
of
tried
it
sooner

good

55cl

sandbach
poured
into
an
oversize
moors
brewery
glass
with
slight
lacing
on
the
pour
appearance
is
a
rich
ruby
colour
the
fruity
aroma
hits
you
immediately
prunes
cherries
damsons
with
caramel
prominent
the
aroma
is
a
real
promise
of
whats
to
come
the
complex
nature
of
this
ale
abounds
in
the
taste
as
in
the
aroma
dried
dark
fruits
dominate
the
palate
a
chewy
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
experience
with
lingering
soft
bitterness
a
rather
expensive
beer
that
would
inhibit
drinking
it
too
often
but
as
its
brewed
as
a
special
its
definitely
worth
a
go
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
and
is
also
has
a
lot
of
sugar
notes
the
flavor
is
strong

with
some
toffee
and

i
dont
know
if
i
can
really
suggest
buying
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
a
good
one
its
very
deep
if
youre
drawn
in
by
the
label
and
buy
this
despite
its
hefty
price
tag
chances
are
youre
doing
so
because
youre
looking
for
exactly
what
this
beer
is
ready
to
deliver
you
can
find
similarly
big
and
deep
beers
for
less
money
but
if
you
favor
such
beers
you
might
want
to
try
this
at
least
once
since
it
could
turn
out
to
be
your
favorite
beer
good
as
a
desert
beer
can
need
e
g
a
stilton
as
complement
drinkability
is
ok
it
is
hurt
some
by
that
slight
sour
taste
drinkability
is
good
i
prefer
lower
abv
english
ales
but
this
one
is
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
real
pleasure
this
was
the
2008
vintage
and
i
wish
i
had
found
it
sooner
i
will
be
getting
another
bottle
to
cellar
for
a
rainy
day
great
beer
pairs
well
with
venison
it
was
a
nice
change
to
focus
on
a
beer
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
rather
than
the
latest
uberhoppy
or
maltmonster
on
the
scene
after
reading
the
bottle
and
noting
the
barrel
conditioning
and
stonevat
fermentation
i
expected
somethign
with
an
odd
flavor
profile
my
bottle
was
two
years
old
and
was
exceptionally
mellow
raisin
and
caramel
malt
mildly
sweet
and
calling
to
mind
a
longaged
barleywine
d
a
nice
beer
but
i
regret
that
i
didnt
put
it
in
my
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
no
its
to
alcoholic
and
a
bit
unbalanced
this
will
probably
evolve
into
something
great
if
cellared
properly
drinkability
quite
a
drinkable
beer
i
rather
enjoy
it
and
would
gladly
have
again
this
is
a
great
beer
its
a
deep
mahongany
colour
with
some
lacing
and
a
creamy
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
warm
and
inviting
almost
reminiscent
of
roasting
chestnuts
the
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
flavours
of
caramel
almonds
and
bourbon
vanilla
although
i
wish
it
had
a
creamier
texture
however
the
spicy
hop
finish
and
slightly
lighter
feel
to
this
beverage
allowed
it
to
be
smooth
and
drinkable
as
opposed
to
syrupy
dpretty
solid
this
was
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
but
a
little
expensive
12
so
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
without
loving
it
of
toffee
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
nose
a
little
boozy
but
its
fresh
and
meant
to
be
aged
so
some
booziness
is
forgivable
little
touches
of
candied
fruit
if
you
look
for
them
flavors
of
oak
vanilla
and
candied
fruit
tastes
like
an
old
ale
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
remarkably
softwith
gentle
carbonation
not
all
i
hoped
it
would
be
but
i
will
try
it
again
in
a
year
i
barely
wanted
to
finish
the
bottle
perhaps
aging
would
allow
some
of
the
hop
presence
to
fade
and
produce
a
better
beer
but
i
was
a
little
bummed
by
the
lack
of
barrel
presence
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
money
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
wouldnt
buy
again
only
because
of
the
price
served
from
bottle
into
a
euro
pint
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
no
lacing
was
apparent
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
oak
hint
the
flavor
of
this
brew
was
sweet
and
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nicely
flavored
brew
that
was
quite
refreshing
this
was
a
very
nice
offering
from
samuel
smith
too
bad
it
is
a
limited
release
d
very
nice
all
around
havent
been
disappointed
by
sam
smith
yet
overall
like
most
of
the
samuel
smith
brews
pretty
tasty
drinkability
its
pretty
filling
but
i
cant
stop
drinking
this
its
so
dang
tasty
sort
of
a
more
sessionable
version
of
an
old
ale
one
of
the
first
examples
of
the
style
i
recall
reviewing
but
this
seems
like
a
excellent
point
of
departure
2008
vintage
this
poured
a
hazy
light
mahogany
with
some
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
raisin
and
honey
wheat
with
light
caramel
and
some
toffee
and
delicate
oak
and
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
nutty
malt
and
bready
yeast
it
tasted
like
succulent
caramel
and
candied
cherries
and
vanilla
oak
with
some
honey
wheat
and
raisin
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
mellow
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
what
i
would
consider
to
be
the
flagship
for
samuel
smith
it
had
a
great
complex
but
subtle
scent
and
taste
that
i
could
savor
for
a
long
time
i
wish
this
beer
had
more
body
but
it
hid
the
alcohol
very
well
so
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
and
a
delight
to
sip
this
is
an
old
alebarleywine
that
rivals
harvest
ale
or
thomas
hardys
and
could
probably
age
for
as
many
decades
as
those
drinkability
not
as
special
as
sam
smith
ris
but
this
is
still
a
spectacular
english
classic
just
not
a
very
good
value
at
12
a
bottle
overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
again
d
starts
out
awesome
but
the
more
i
got
into
it
the
more
i
started
to
think
of
this
as
a
treat
beer
that
is
better
in
small
doses
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
if
this
had
a
stronger
finish
then
this
would
be
a
stunner
this
is
one
tasty
well
crafted
beer
thats
meant
to
be
sipped
lots
of
flavor
which
really
develops
as
it
warms
it
would
go
great
with
a
steak
dinner
could
i
see
myself
ordering
one
of
these
in
a
smoky
english
pub
damn
skippy
a
perfect
beer
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
very
well
done
ss
d
it
warms
as
it
goes
down
but
doesnt
feel
overpowering
in
any
way
i
like
it
a
lot
cheers
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
creamy
yellow
stained
head
forceful
pour
reveals
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
but
minimal
retension
smells
of
vanilla
oak
malt
and
the
slightest
amount
of
hops
faint
amount
of
lace
clngs
to
the
glass
taste
has
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
upfront
that
blends
right
into
a
pleasant
mixture
of
oak
vanilla
grain
and
some
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
medium
smooth
feel
with
low
carbonation
as
it
warms
more
caramel
notes
come
out
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
not
too
bad
worth
a
try
d
a
solid
strong
ale
great
aroma
lends
itself
more
to
a
better
drinkability
score
due
to
a
lower
abv
than
alot
of
strong
ales
out
there
thicker
than
most
too
but
it
fits
it
well
this
might
benefit
from
further
aging
but
its
great
now
notes
a
rival
for
nut
brown
ale
for
my
favorite
samuel
smith
beer
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
one
all
in
all
i
really
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
of
the
stuff
ill
definitely
be
keeping
my
eyes
out
for
it
in
the
future
very
drinkable
nice
beer

i

i

drinkability
a

good

good

good

this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
get
when
you
want
to
mix
it
up
a
bit
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
beer
many
times
but
it
is
always
like
13
around
here
so
i
always
decide
against
it
but
i
was
feeling
down
tonight
so
i
got
it
as
a
treat
to
myself
and
i
am
glad
i
did
because
it
is
delicious
d
this
is
fantastic
beer
man
i
wish
this
was
56
a
bottle
but
alas
its
not
to
be
i
can
only
see
this
getting
more
complex
with
time
i
dont
know
how
long
it
will
last
but
id
like
to
be
with
it
on
the
journey
sam
smiths
introduced
me
to
english
beers
and
with
this
effort
is
reminding
me
that
the
english
make
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
especially
with
their
strongoldebarleywine
type
ales
this
is
a
beer
that
harkins
back
200
years
to
tradtional
english
brewing
with
true
lactic
character
minerality
and
complexity
a
must
buy
even
at
the
13
pricetag
open
up
a
book
of
tennyson
or
hardy
and
relax
and
reminisce
on
a
cool
winter
evening
d
flavorwise
very
drinkable
but
then
you
try
to
stand
up
and
it
hits
you
share
with
a
friend
if
possible
extremely
tasty
and
interesting
overall
presentation
one
that
i
will
seek
out
again
na
zdravje
overall
this
is
like
somebodys
first
high
abv
homebrew
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
and
the
old
ale
style
so
i
was
really
psyched
when
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
and
paid
pretty
handsomely
for
it
i
was
ready
to
love
this
brew
all
night
long
but
most
of
it
will
be
destined
for
the
drain
it
really
pains
me
to
slam
a
sam
smith
beer
when
i
so
often
defend
them
to
other
beer
nerds
but
this
is
just
bad
news
if
you
are
an
english
old
ale
fan
fullers
vintage
is
cheaper
easier
to
find
and
far
superior
drinkability
i
view
this
as
an
experience
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
either
i
have
to
develop
a
better
palate
or
this
beer
just
has
way
too
much
going
on
for
me
to
appreciate
all
of
its
nuances
its
good
it
went
well
with
a
meal
quiche
lorraine
and
salad
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
will
be
awhile
before
i
try
this
again
its
certainly
like
no
beer
ive
had
before
could
be
much
better
thicker
its
certainly
a
strong
ale
but
i
wonder
if
this
batch
is
off
or
something
drinkability
the
8
abv
is
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
scoring
this
one
at
4
5
in
this
category
a
solid
beer
but
doesnt
taste
quite
as
good
as
the
aroma
had
me
hoping
also
somewhat
overpriced
aside
from
that
its
certainly
worth
a
try
comment
i
consider
the
yorkshire
stingo
as
a
historical
brewing
artifact
this
is
what
i
believe
a
quality
english
brown
ale
was
like
250
years
ago
and
drinking
this
is
like
a
trip
back
in
time
the
methods
materials
ingredients
are
essentially
a
replica
from
that
period
and
the
necessary
economy
then
would
call
for
the
longterm
reuse
of
expensive
oak
casks
these
old
barrels
imparted
a
unique
character
and
i
believe
it
to
be
shown
skillfully
in
this
brew
good
stuff
has
a
sweet
sticky
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
properly
carbonated
this
is
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
even
though
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticeable
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
pricy
for
what
it
is
drinkability
some
warming
ensues
after
the
first
few
sips
most
welcome
with
the
temps
outside
being
in
the
single
digits
but
other
than
that
it
is
hidden
pretty
well
i
like
it
a
lot
and
if
you
like
malt
forward
brews
as
much
as
i
do
you
will
favour
this
one
a
firm
thumbs
up
from
me
probably
one
of
the
surprise
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
i
am
fully
dismayed
and
bummed
i
am
generally
not
very
impressed
by
stingo
and
when
the
10
9918
7
oz
price
tag
is
factored
in
it
cannot
be
recommended
im
definitely
digging
this
one
as
its
definitely
a
very
sweet
beer
but
with
a
nice
balancing
job
being
done
by
the
barrel
character
really
nice
beer
a
muddy
golden
ruby
color
with
a
lasting
two
finger
light
tan
head
some
spotty
lacong
left
behind
light
to
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
apple
skins
raisons
sweet
toffee
malt
oak
burbon
and
a
hint
of
horse
blanket
flavor
is
malty
with
a
light
anount
of
funk
yeasty
bready
with
a
little
more
of
the
burbon
type
note
coming
through
rasins
and
at
times
hints
of
apple
fairly
bitter
malty
medium
body
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
and
a
spicy
hop
finish
this
was
a
strange
brew
for
sure
but
the
more
of
it
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
not
sure
i
would
call
it
sessionable
but
quite
interesting
drinkability
the
easy
going
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
drinkable
powerful
and
rich
thick
with
raisins
honey
caramel
and
sweet
wine
nicely
oaked
quite
buttery
and
even
a
bit
coconutty
complex
and
quite
dense
balanced
with
a
bit
of
whiskey
heat
and
a
lemony
hop
bitterness
in
the
background

lovely

fact
though
at
the
price
tag
of
around
eleven
bucks
per
bottle
the
real
source
of
the
stingo
i
dont
see
myself
returning
to
it
anytime
soon
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
burnt
toffee
scent
along
with
slightly
fruity
english
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
an
incredibly
malty
flavor
that
screams
burnt
toffee
and
and
oak
aging
the
oak
compliments
the
warm
malty
flavor
and
adds
a
level
of
complexity
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
wonderful
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
english
strong
ales
and
barleywines
the
oak
aging
is
a
bonus
as
far
as
im
concerned
pours
a
three
finger
light
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some

with
a
slightly

texture
is
fairly
rough
and
fizzy
and
it
leaves
a
somewhat
bitter
but
not
nasty
aftertaste
worth
a
try

medium

with

pretty
interesting
stuff
i
wonder
if
they
used
something
like
the
wyeast
old
ale
strain
with
some
brett
in
it
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
was
somewhat
enjoyable
though
i
dont
think
this
is
a
style
i
would
often
choose
it
fits
a
lot
of
the
style
components
pretty
well
but
seems
to
lack
in
the
boldness
of
aroma
flavor
d
i
rated
drinkability
was
average
a
bit
boozy
with
a
limited
complexity
and
particularly
didnt
make
my
tongue
dance
with
excitement
didnt
go
down
as
easy
as
old
ale
should
at
8
0
i
might
be
in
the
minority
here
but
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
dont
think
the
bottle
is
bad
but
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
its
an
interesting
challenging
beer
but
not
up
to
sam
smiths
usual
standards
caramel
and
breadiness
are
met
by
a
similar
fresh
green
apples
note
odd
not
very
sweet
almost
on
the
drying
end
of
things
slightly
tart
faint
earthiness
light
body
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
though
an
odd
one
to
pin
down
d
its
intriguing
but
not
something
id
have
pints
of
in
my
imperial
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
cherry
amber
color
with
a
mediumsized
light
tan
head
it
had
an
aroma
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
taste
of
raisin
caramel
and
a
bit
of
late
hops
other
than
feeling
a
little
sharp
in
my
mouth
i
very
much
liked
this
beer
ive
always
liked
samuel
smith
nice
to
see
theyre
trying
some
different
things
i
was
glad
to
try
a
more
extreme
version
of
an
english
ale
nice
to
see
such
a
classic
brewery
staying
creative
though
at
8
for
a
barrel
aged
ale
it
is
still
decidedly
english
in
comparison
to
strong
american
ales
the
main
difference
here
is
it
maintains
balance
despite
its
respective
extremes
and
the
drinkability
is
resultantly
still
very
high
i
am
a
fan
of
this
one
pours
a
hazy
crimsonbrown
color
with
light
khaki
colored
head
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
scent
is
of
traditional
english
cask
brown
ale
biscuity
malts
roasted
nuts
with
hints
of
dark
dried
fruits
vanilla
and
oak
as
well
as
faint
spicing
in
the
taste
the
dried
fruit
raisin
prune
are
more
pronounced
and
balance
with
the
biscuity
and
nutty
flavors
the
vanilla
oak
and
spicing
are
in
the
background
and
it
finishes
with
a
distinct
shot
of
boozyness
medium
bodied
fully
carbonated
semidry
finish
good
beer
slightly
too
heavy
on
the
dark
dried
fruit
and
booze
for
me
to
appreciate
it
complex
yes
well
balanced
maybe
not
so
much
pours
a
wonderful
warm
color
like
stained
wood
a
small
tanbrown
head
rest
atop
the
brew
rich
but
somewhat
restrained
initially
in
the
nose
notes
of
butterscotch
caramel
vanilla
rum
raisin
and
whiskey
fill
the
bouquet
as
the
beer
warms
creamy
mouthfeel
a
satisfying
candy
sweetness
finished
off
by
warming
alcohol
waves
layered
and
complex
the
wood
flavors
are
interesting
a
special
beer
for
sure
highly
recommended
the
beer
is
modestly
carbonated
decently
so
for
the
style
the
taste
has
a
pronounced
oakiness
an
old
fashioned
toffee
caramel
flavor
with
sweet
malts
permeating
the
beer
there
is
a
definite
abv
presence
in
the
beer
a
touch
of
throatiness
a
slight
sourishness
and
plenty
of
boozy
retention
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
palate
of
flavors
this
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
but
it
is
good
complex
well
made
and
very
drinkable
d
this
didnt
wow
me
especailly
considering
the
high
price
tag
it
just
tasted
like
a
malty
strong
ale
with
little
to
no
complexity
d
not
worth
12
on
top
of
that
i
found
it
pretty
hard
to
finish
before
i
was
even
a
third
of
the
way
through
too
sweet
for
me
this
is
a
very
solid
effort
from
samuel
smith
i
wasnt
surprised
that
this
was
a
good
beer
as
this
particular
brewery
seems
to
put
out
nothing
but
solid
if
unspectacular
brews
worth
acquiring
unless
the
12bottle
price
tag
scares
you
d
letting
this
beer
warm
up
really
does
the
trick
i
let
it
cool
a
bit
too
long
in
the
fridge
which
stunted
its
flavors
the
more
it
warmed
the
better
it
got
a
most
excellent
accompaniment
to
a
cold
and
snowy
night
pours
pale
amber
colur
with
tan
head
nose
has
a
delightful
candied
character
almost
reminding
me
of
holiday
candy
cane
peppermint
on
the
palate
the
malt
comes
through
with
a
biscuity
quality
perhaps
black
tea
and
a
soft
candied
sweetness
easy
drinking
d
hides
the
8
perfectly
one
of
the
best
english
ales
ive
had
550ml
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
bottle
conditioned
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
malty
aroma
with
some
carmelized
sugar
and
a
bit
of
hops
medium
to
full
bodied
malt
predominates
with
dark
fruit
some
hops
in
the
finish
just
a
hint
of
the
oak
i
had
really
high
expectations
for
this
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
british
beers
but
i
found
it
a
bit
lacking
and
overpriced
overall
pretty
tasty
good
look
about
the
brew
the
bubbles
are
sticking
to
the
middle
of
the
glass
for
some
reason
huh
the
body
is
a
ruby
orange
with
slight
turbidity
and
thick
cream
colour
head
the
foam
is
pretty
creamy
and
lasts
a
good
while
forming
into
big
bubbles
and
breaking
up
that
way
the
nose
is
like
that
of
a
esb
that
has
been
aged
in
oak
hoppy
a
bit
sweet
with
a
good
rustic
oak
note
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
but
has
a
good
bunch
of
hops
to
even
out
the
taste
the
oak
also
adds
a
nice
touch
adding
depth
and
an
additional
character
to
the
malts
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
brew
had
8
abv
it
is
just
too
damn
silky
smooth
the
feel
is
medium
thick
with
medium
carbonation
i
really
like
this
and
wish
the
price
tag
wasnt
so
damn
high
samuel
smiths
really
did
an
impressive
job
with
yorkshire
stingo
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
suffice
it
to
say
its
damn
good
very
close
to
being
a
flatout
amazing
beer
the
slight
bandaid
like
flavor
is
its
sole
shortcoming
im
sure
thats
a
natural
result
of
the
oak
aging
and
some
may
find
it
quite
appealing
im
not
so
enamored
with
it
nonetheless
yorkshire
stingo
is
a
very
nice
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
have
the
opportunity
you
wont
be
disappointed
wow
i
did
not
want
to
like
this
enough
to
spring
for
another
bottle
but
i
will
thanks

getting
these

you
this

goes
down
dangerously
easily
good
stuff
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
im
not
sure
it
would
be
worth
the
price
tag
to
have
regularly
if
you
werent
paying
too
close
attention
you
could
drink
through
this
pretty
quickly
as
a
drinkable
somewhat
average
ale
though
you
might
get
hit
by
the
8
abv
youd
miss
a
lot
of
the
complexity
by
doing
that
however
id
buy
it
again
though
im
not
sure
ill
make
it
a
regular
purchase
it
is
however
absolutely
a
worthwhile
beer
to
try
lots
of
taste
and
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
one
will
set
you
back
a
few
bucks
but
the
splurge
is
worth
it
another
top
notch
offering
from
the
folks
at
sam
smith
moreish
as
the
brits
say
a
sipper
but
one
youll
go
back
to
sip
after
sip
looking
for
another
nuance
i
wish
i
had
a
fireplace
and
a
fur
rug
right
now
one
of
the
best
english
ales
i
have
had
right
up
there
with
fullers

remarkable
oh
before
i
forget
i
found
the
oak
everyone
overall
this
is
just
a
fantastic
strong
beer
unbelievably
complex
yet
very
elegant
its
nice
to
drink
a
strong
beer
that
isnt
overthetop
extreme
like
many
of
the
american
interpretations
seem
to
be
a
medium
plus
body
with
complimentary
carbonation
give
this
brew
a
welcomed
drinkability
its
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
but
if
your
into
samuel
smith
you
must
try
this
one
i
honestly
think
that
some
additional
age
on
this
brew
would
be
a
good
thing
although
its
more
than
good
to
go
right

this

very

slight

to
the
taste
could
not
drink
more
than
a
pint
of
this
great
brew
in
one
sitting
but
still
an
awesome
ale
a
really
easy
beer
to
enjoy
fresh
but
i
am
excited
to
try
to
cellar
this
one
for
a
while
the
price
tag
makes
this
one
i
wont
be
able
to
enjoy
often
but
as
i
finish
this
glass
i
am
definately
glad
that
i
got
to
experience
it
sam
smith
has
never
disapointed
me
and
with
great
beer
like
stingo
i
dont
see
how
they
ever
can
d
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
tasty
oak
aged
english
strong
well
worth
a
try
but
probably
wont
be
revisiting
immediately
the
flavors
are
great
and
i
think
sharing
the
16oz
is
the
way
to
go
i
found
the
price
to
be
slightly
high
but
i
recommend
trying
this
ale
from
samuel
smiths
oaky
warm
balanced
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
samuel
smiths
beers
but
this
yorkshire
stingo
has
won
me
over
with
its
intense
oak
flavor
the
beer
pours
pumpkin
candle
orange
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
quickly
it
smells
sweet
and
oaky
like
an
old
rocking
chair
at
your
grandmothers
house
there
are
some
nice
earth
and
fruit
notes
lingering
in
the
aroma
as
well
it
reminds
me
of
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
more
in
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
but
both
have
that
same
pervasiveness
almost
overwhelming
oak
note
that
i
associate
with
jps
beers
and
i
say
that
with
nothing
but
affection
for
oaky
beers
particularly
jps
of
course
stingo
doesnt
really
seem
to
have
been
soured
at
all
the
flavor
is
still
quite
dry
but
there
are
hints
of
caramel
malt
pushing
through
it
tastes
mostly
of
fruit
and
oak
the
fruit
flavors
are
citric
cidery
and
a
bit
floral
in
a
fruitish
way
its
an
excellent
beer
and
im
happy
to
have
found
myself
a
bottle
i
may
just
have
to
go
back
and
see
if
i
overlooked
any
other
beers
from
sam
smith
bottle
from
bevmo
poured
dark
mahogany
with
nice
red
edges
puffy
creamy
offwhite
head
minimal
lacing
on
the
dimpled
mug
flattish
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
kind
of
thin
malty
caramel
and
some
crystal
malt
but
everything
is
glossed
over
with
a
vanillaoak
flavor
its
very
pleasant
but
i
wanted
more
hops
or
something
to
pop
out
in
all
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
left
me
kind
of
disappointed
additional
point
this
paired
very
well
with
a
nicelyaged
mimolette
cheese
d
this
is
much
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
i
was
expecting
a
slow
sipper
but
the
flavors
arent
as
in
your
face
as
i
was
expecting
and
the
feel
and
carbonation
levels
really
keep
it
easy
drinking
the
beer
is
good
but
its
not
amazing
by
any
stretch
i
guess
i
may
have
been
expecting
too
much
because
i
love
sammy
smith
brews
so
much
with
that
said
its
still
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pay
that
price
again
for
this
thats
for
certain
still
an
enjoyable
experience
just
not
all

it

to
this
drinkability
excellent
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
of
these
samuel
smiths
always
does
a
wonderful
job
with
their
fine
brews
quite
respectable
i
need
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
as
i
didnt
quite
get
the
whole
show
first
time
out
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
great
thick
and
deep
brown
color
with
great
initial
head
although
no
lacing
great
scent
thick
and
malty
with
wonderful
vanilla
tones
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
bourbon
very
deep
flavor
malty
and
thick
very
barleywinish
with
a
very
noticable
bourbon
cask
finish
goes
down
very
well
with
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
finish
very
warming
very
good
this
one
seemed
to
hold
up
pretty
well
in
the
oak
barrel
and
could
probably
last
another
year
in
the
cellar
recommended
very
very
nice
to
see
this
offering
from
samuel
smiths
in
the
atlanta
area
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
aged
in
oak
casks
for
over
a
year
i
wonder
what
sort
of
casks
they
used
and
if
they
were
new
or
used
previously
a
whole
year
is
long
enough
for
some
critters
to
infect
the
wood
and
bring
a
little
sourness
to
the
beer
which
this
has
even
in
new
oak
this
has
a
note
of
apples
in
the
smell
and
taste
however
and
i
wonder
if
a
cider
or
scumpy
barrel
was
used
or
a
calvados
barrel
this
pours
a
slightly
turgid
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
the
beer
smells
nicely
of
stored
apples
a
bit
of
brandy
and
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
oak
and
some
sweet
rich
bready
malt
on
the
end
the
taste
is
lean
and
woody
with
more
of
that
apple
fruit
dry
oak
notes
a
touch
of
sherry
vinegar
and
some
very
dry
crackery
malt
nicely
taut
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
pleasing
old
ale
in
my
book
of
a
style
not
often
seen
on
these
shores
very
nice
md
sam
smith
doesnt
disappoint
a
layered
smooth
complex
yet
not
overpowering
this
is
a
great
beer
too
bad
its
11
a
bottle
or
id
get
it
more
d
i
was
really
exited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
did
not
disappoint
a
really
nice
example
of
an
english
ale
with
a
twist
they
should
never
stop
production
of
this
beer
really
great
d
a
wonderful
strong
ale
possibly
my
favorite
yet
from
this
venerable
uk
brewery
8
strength
and
woody
resplendence
make
this
more
of
a
sipper
than
anything
but
its
one
i
want
again
and
again
will
definitely
pick
up
more
though
lofty
bottle
prices
around
9
as
i
recall
prevent
this
from
being
the
fallwinter
staple
it
otherwise
could
be
im
excited
to
see
the
english
doing
some
barrelaged
brews
although
im
under
the
impression
these
are
ancient
beer
barrels
this
is
definitely
a
mellow
chillout
dessert
kind
of
brew
so
dont
expect
to
be
putting
these
back
even
with
the
midlevel
abv
poured
a
clear
leather
brown
body
with
a
faomy
tan
head
that
died
slowly
and
left
lace
on
the
glass
a
rich
malt
smell
of
sweetness
and
breadiness
along
with
roasted
and
oakwood
and
minor
floral
hops
english
beers
always
give
off
that
slight
tea
smell
to
me
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
this
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
is
real
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
has
some
fruit
notes
and
even
something
like
a
fig
or
raisin
taste
in
there
as
the
yeast
and
oak
complements
the
beer
in
both
going
down
and
taste
also
has
that
dry
breadiness
to
it
along
with
some
minor
sweetness
like
caramel
or
molasses
has
a
easy
dry
finish
and
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
an
8
beer
i
will
have
to
have
this
again
next
year
d
thick
and
heavy
this
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
it
borders
on
being
overly
sweet
and
the
thick
malt
is
almost
too
much
it
is
possible
to
pick
out
some
oak
character
but
it
is
not
out
in
front
and
only
serves
to
mellow
and
compliment
the
malt
the
dark
malt
flavors
are
quite
rich
and
complex
and
it
is
almost
like
a
belgian
dubble
or
quad
not
bad
overall
i
like
the
malt
complexity
though
i
probably
wont
be
looking
for
another
bottle
of
this
flavor
is
pretty
similar
to
arom
but
a
touch
sweeter

with
a
nice

as
well
as
some

is

drinkable
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
highly
recommended

and
a
touch
of
buttery

up

with

lending
a
slight

mid
palate
fruit
cake
more
specifically
a
bit
nutty
with
just
a
hint
of
that
tartness
i
pick
up
in
the
nose
theres
a
touch
of
diacetyl
but
in
that
pleasant
english
way
it
pops
up
for
a
moment
and
then
disappears
before
the
finish
on
the
fuller
side
of
mediumbodied
rich
without
even
approaching
cloying
and
very
mellow
in
the
finish
with
a
subtle
tartness
balancing
the
lingering
caramel
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
wood
from
this
one
beyond
a
hint
of
tannin
but
from
the
sounds
of
it
this
one
is
aged
in
old
oak
barrels
that
have
lost
much
of
their
natural
character
delicious
stuff
all
the
same
rich
mellow
and
easy
to
sip
on
over
the
course
of
a
couple
hours
great
beer
i
will
never
spend
another
12
on
it
but
if
i
could
get
it
maybe
104pack
id
be
a
happy
repeat

devestatingly

flavors
amazing
d
this
is
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
it
is
good
and
i
enjoy
drinking
it
but
i
dont
want
another
this
moment
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
into
a
sam
smiths
pint
glass
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
smells
of
caramel
and
stonefruit
tastes
of
peaches
apricots
and
vanilla
with
other
lurking
flavors
like
oak
and
plum
and
im
surprised
that
im
not
getting
the
stony
flavor
that
ive
gotten
from
those
yorkshire
squares
in
some
of
their
other
offerings
most
likely
due
to
the
oak
barrel
aging
after
the
yorkshire
squares
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
warming
at
the
same
time
its
wonderful
to
drink
and
im
glad
i
got
2
i
will
be
getting
at
least
2
more
so
they
can
warm
me
up
in
those
northeast
winter
months
overall
this
is
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
the
alcohol
level
is
lower
than
some
yet
it
does
retain
all
of
the
elements
of
a
strong
ale
drinks
fairly
well
but
i
bet
another
year
or
3
would
help
this
more
down
the
road
not
sure
i
would
ever
cough
up
12
for
this
again
it
is
always
nice
to
see
new
beers
from
the
brewers
at
samuel
smith
this
is
a
strong
ale
aged
in
barrels
this
is
a
rose
colored
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
white
heading
that
lasts
a
long
while
as
the
label
indicates
i
get
smells
of
prunes
and
christmas
pudding
more
of
the
same
in
the
flavor
with
some
mild
alcohol
notes
and
a
bit
of
sweet
molasses
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
alcohol
never
seeming
hot
a
sipper
of
a
beer
too
this
is
one
to
sit
in
front
of
the
fire
to
sip
and
enjoy
this
is
a
stellar
beer
from
samuel
smith
and
perfectly
fits
the
criteria
for
what
i
look
for
in
a
strong
ale
i
highly
recommend
laying
a
fwe
of
these
down
to
age
in
the
cellar
i
can
imagine
a
little
time
would
do
wonderful
things
to
this
beer
cheers
d
very
despite
the
8
abv
i
found
this
550
ml
bottle
disappearing
quickly
i
really
like
sours
and
old
ales
and
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
old
style
brew
that
deserves
plenty
of
modern
attention
very
drinkable
now
while
its
fresh
but
i
think
that
it
will
become
even
more
delicious
with
some
extended
cellar
time
ill
let
you
know
in
a
few
years
hazy
amber
colored
brew
forms
a
2
inch

which
dissipates
slowly

tight

themselves
in
a
hypnotic
fashion
nose
is
enticingly
complex
with
notes
of
toffee
malt
sour
cherries
vanilla
and
bread
pudding
taste
has
an
overall
sweetness
to
it
but
some
mild
bitterness
sneaks
itself
in
and
out
of
the
drink
effortlessly
oak
lends
itself
nicely
through
the
finish
medium
bodied
creamy
brew
exceeded
my
expectations
and
i
would
recommend
it
overall
i
believe
this
is
my
first
english
strong
ale
and
the
flavors
were
a
bit
of
a
shock
as
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
english
barleywine
once
you
become
acquainted
with
with
the
fruit
flavors
this
turns
into
a
decently
complex
beer
worth
a
shot
pours
a
clear
russet
with
a
twofinger
white
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
but
not
much
with
a
lingering
white
rim
the
smell
is
sort
of
like
mincemeat
without
so
much
of
the
spicing
savory
and
sweet
with
notes
of
dried
currants
and
indeed
a
little
nutmeg
there
is
a
definite
alcohol
presence
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
strong
hits
of
maybe
juniper
added
in
that
comes
up
at
the
finish
with
the
alcohol
burn
its
highly
carbonated
a
little
thick
very
full
in
the
mouth
ive
been
an
hour
working
on
this
pint
not
a
sipper
exactly
but
slow
and
pleasant
going
a
very
nice
beer
the
beer
is
good
and
a
decent
drink
yet
the
parts
are
actually
better
than
the
whole
on
this
one
its
decent
in
fact
its
very
good
but
there
is
a
body
texture
solidity
missing
i
confess
that
it
gets
better
and
better
and
seeminly
more
complex
and
attractive
the
more
one
drinks
it
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
most
english
brews
this
is
one
of
englands
best
even
with
criticism
this
is
a
complex
well
made
and
well
conceived
brew
this
is
a
distinctive
and
unique
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
it
is
sharp
and
somewhat
strong
as
the
name
implies
an
interesting
brew
and
another
musttry
brew
from
sam
smith
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
fantastically
complex
beer
that
is
perfectly
balanced
and
has
a
lot
of
unique
flavors
going
on
whereas
many
oakaged
beers
ive
tried
have
been
overpowering
the
oak
here
takes
a
back
seat
and
provides
a
wonderful
background
for
all
the
other
flavors
id
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
you
can
get
over
the
high
price
a
good
sipper
pounding
this
beer
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
money
as
it
is
fairly
pricey
t
m
d
the
first
sip
of
this
took
me
back
a
little
theres
quite
a
few
flavours
going
on
and
it
is
most
certainly
robust
the
malt
profile
like
many
english
styles
are
modest
in
comparison
to
many
american
beers
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
oak
aging
has
added
a
big
flavour
of
vanilla
and
damp
wood
theres
quite
a
tartness
to
it
almost
even
a
bit
sour
and
quite
intense
as
it
breathes
it
can
become
a
little
cloying
and
challenging
to
drink
and
is
more
appropriate
to
be
taken
very
slowly
or
shared
with
good
company
been
waiting
for
stingo
to
hit
our
shores
for
about
a
year
now
really
excited
to
finally
try
this
one
a
550ml
bottle
purchased
for
9
poured
into
my
standard
tulip
glass
the
ale
appears
a
crystal
clear
bright
crimson
color
with
about
an
inch
of
off
white
head
truly
awesome
looking
when
help
up
against
a
light
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
raisins
prunes
dried
cherries
treacle
toffee
brown
sugar
vanilla
oak
figs
slight
alcohol
fruity
dry
with
a
medium
to
full
body
and
rather
light
carbonation
excellent
stuff
and
quite
easy
to
drink
all
strong
ale
fans
need
to
seek
this
one
out
pours
a
light
cherry
red
with
a
large
and
furious
pure
tan
head
which
begins
to
fade
quickly
then
about
halfway
down
stops
and
slowly
disintigrates
before
settling
into
a
thick
covering
some
small
jagged
lines
of
lace
are
scattered
to
and
fro
big
sweet
malts
and
spice
hit
the
nose
up
front
as
some
dark
sweet
and
sour
fruits
and
some
booziness
float
around
in
the
back
tastes
of
spice
big
sweet
malts
vinegar
brown
sugar
and
sour
grapes
a
lingering
but
not
at
all
bothersome
alcohol
heat
sticks
to
the
tongue
and
the
back
of
the
throat
its
medium
bodied
yet
goes
down
fluidly
with
a
little
airiness
involved
our
british
droogs
should
be
way
proud
of
this
one
a
sipper
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
interestingparticularly
in
the
nose
the
wood
from
the
cask
aging
really
comes
through
in
the
smell
a
bit
cloying
and
oddly
sort
of
boring
in
taste
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
worth
a
try
d
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
brew
as
sam
smiths
has
always
been
a
quality
brewery
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
though
the
flavor
wasnt
up
to
the
standard
that
i
am
accustomed
from
s
ss
especially
considering
the
high
price
tag
final
thoughts
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
the
nose
is
a
little
light
but
the
taste
starts
very
curiously
with
tangy
but
sweet
and
rich
fruits
as
well
as
deep
malts
its
almost
like
the
staple
beer
for
a
british
old
ale
some
nice
sugary
tastes
as
well
as
some
slight
oak
and
other
rich
flavors
and
follows
with
a
slight
bitterness
its
very
complex
and
tasty
but
perhaps
just
a
touch
too
sweet
on
the
finish
d
exquisite
and
worldly
this
is
a
sophisticated
brew
an
enjoyable
experience
slightly
more
than
a
sipper
but
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
and
relished
slowly
overall
comes
with
my
high
recommendation
the
best
sam
smith
beer
ive
had
and
deceptively
drinkable
if
you
can
find
this
one
id
say
buy
one
for
the
experience
though
i
dont
know
if
ill
be
getting
more
given
the
price
tag
drinkability
very
enjoyable
the
high
gravity
at
8
makes
it
a
bit
heady
after
a
full
bottle
first
off
its
got
a
great
dark
copper
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
yellowishtan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quick
nose
is
sweet
with
pronounced
hop
and
fruit
characters
and
a
background
of
leather
starts
off
with
an
oaken
malty
spiciness
that
progresses
to
some
nice
flavoring
hops
then
some
slightly
roasted
and
nutty
characters
before
finishing
with
an
alcoholic
warmth
and
lingering
floral
bitterness
reminiscent
of
a
lambic
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
effervescent
almost
like
a
bubbly
cognac
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
balanced
its
a
great
example
of
what
an
old
ale
can
strive
to
be
theres
a
fine
balance
between
an
old
ale
english
barleywine
and
flanders
ale
if
you
have
a
chance
to
purchase
a
bottle
get
two
it
pours
a
dark
amber
hue
its
well
carbonated
and
has
nice
creamy
pale
head
it
smells
bready
and
sweet
with
lots
of
vanilla
almost
like
a
fresh
baked
cake
the
taste
is
very
sweet
again
with
vanilla
is
very
present
along
with
toffee
dark
fruits
there
is
a
little
bit
of
oak
less
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
barrel
age
it
goes
down
super
smooth
its
just
creamy
enough
the
high
abv
mixed
with
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
makes
me
feel
that
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
too
often
but
overall
it
was
very
enjoyable
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
strong
ale
from
ss
a
clear
british
influence
in
this
beer
and
the
barrel
aging
is
nice
and
subtle
leaving
one
able
to
enjoy
quite
a
bit
of
it
rather
than
12oz
followed
by
heartburn
i
love
me
some
bourbon
soaked
us
gnarliness
but
a
good
traditional
strong
ale
is
good
for
the
soul
a
fine
beer
however
the
13
pricetag
is
pretty
damn
ridiculous
give
it
a
shot
though
its
pretty
good
and
could
probably
do
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
d
not
bad
at
all
but
its
not
excellent
from
such
a
great
brewery
i
think
i
would
have
expected
more
but
still
recommended
md
being

beer
oakbarrels

that
this
is
not
the
type
of
big

honeyish
or
peaty
whiskybarrel
aged
ales
that
are
leading
the
beery
fashion
of
late
rather
the
oakageing
here
enriches
the
flavour
in
a
conventional
manner
where
the
sweet
edge
of
malts
is
greatly
softened
by
the
attack
of
sour
elements
accumulated
in
the
oak
barrels
through
decades
of
service
showing
the
similar
kind
of
smooth
woodiness
to
the
brewerys
old
brewery
bitter
not
in
the
same
way
as
wadworths
6x
more
aromatic
sweetwoody
or
marstons
pedigree
more
sulphurous
importantly
through
the
ageing
process
the
alcoholic
content
has
been
totally
tamed
what
ends
up
in
the
glass
is
a
truly
mellow
malt
wine
for
my
palate
benefiting
a
lot
from
the
creamy
carbonation
too
this
old
barley
wine
has
some
really
lovely
finesse
that
requires
patience
to
unwrap
and
fresh
palate
to
appreciate
just
give
it
a
try
beware
of
the
price
though
as
i
paid
almost
6
quid
for
this
bottle
overall
a
superb
example
of
an
old
ale
and
also
of
barrel
aging
done
well
my
favourite
s

with

is

of

trails
off
with

probably
wouldnt

again

and
go
giving
space
to
the
next
one
thornbridge
is
one
of
my
favorites
breweries
and
this
is
an
interesting
brew
to
wake
up
your
senses
o
there
are
things
i
like
about
this
beer
but
there
are
almost
just
as
many
things
that
i
dont
like
kind
of
all
over
the
place
d
nice
complex
and

strong

o
beautifully
complex

o
i
thought
this
a

beer
truly
unique
flavors
and
a
lucious
body
gotta
grab
one
if
you
spot
it
i
would
shell
out
the
dough
to
pick
up
another
one
if
its
still
on

i
go

something
unique
and
special
outstanding
and
rich
without
being
cloying
bold
flavor
and
in
a
different
way
than
other
english
beers
overall
bracia
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
easily
the
most
interesting
one
i
have
had
recently
i
would
love
to
see
a
barrelaged
version
maybe
a
peated
whisky
barrel
in
the
future
i
will
be
buying
a
few
more
of
these
for
the
cellar
some
misses
in
the
smell
is
well
compensated
in
the
taste
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
dry
fruits
with
dry
toffee
notes
are
quite
unique
and
quite
strong
taste
is
a
strange
mix
between
some
dry
toffee
notes
with
caramel
malt
with
some
molasses
notes
with
some
light
fruity
ester
and
some
chestnut
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
complex
beer
with
maybe
a
tad
too
much
going
on
overall
this
one
was
really
tough
to
score
its
very
unique
and
extremely
flavorful
with
lots
going
on
and
plenty
to
contemplate
but
the
aggressiveness
does
make
it
somewhat
difficult
to
enjoy
an
entire
half
litre
yourself
perhaps
this
is
something
better
off
shared
with
a
buddy
regardless
this
brew
has
definitely
made
me
interesting
in
trying
more
of
their
stuff
very
impressive
if
the
opportunity
arises
dont
pass
this
one
up
highly
recommended
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
deep
black
pour
with
a
gorgeous
two
finger
caramelcolored
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
very
unique
roasty
nutty
and
subtly
sweet
nose
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
espresso
licorice
molasses
and
peat
the
taste
is
complex
and
unique
a
lot
going
on
that
ive
never
experienced
lots
of
roasty
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
specifically
black
cherries
licorice
peat
tobacco
and
hazelnuts
theres
something
else
in
there
that
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
perhaps
its
the
chestnut
honey
which
im
unfamiliar
with
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
chewy
and
oily
with
a
bittersweet
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
10
beer
its
a
little
expensive
but
definitely
another
unique
and
great
offering
from
thornbridge
the
feeling
is
not
thick
like
a
stout
there
is
a
lot
of
body
in
the
flavor
but
not
as
much
in
the
feel
there
is
a
light
vinous
feel
to
it
overall
a
pleasure
to
sample
and
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
but
at
the
price
i
dont
think
i
will
again
however
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
d
ive
been
in
a
english
sort
of
mood
having
had
this
and
courage
ris
on
backtoback
days
this
doesnt
have
the
brett
character
of
the
courage
but
its
got
that
wellattenuated
dryness
and
quintessential
english
character
to
it
in
spades
unique
and
somewhat
hard
to
categorize
more
of
a
smoked
beer
than
a
strong
ale
or
stout
but
with
elements
of
all
of
them
i
was
initially
slightly
turned
off
by
the
aroma
but
this
grew
on
me
quite
a
bit
over
the
course
of
a
halfliter
yes
i
drank
it
all
by
myself
pricey
challenging
but
ultimately
rewarding
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
complex
even
though
it
is
not
a
fullbodied
beer
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
fantastic
breweries
if
come
across
that
consecutively
make
traditional
english
beer
in
poignant
and
unique
form
for
anyone
hoping
for
a
courage
ris
just
get
this
o
this
is
a
seriously
impressive
effort
and
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
love
the
complex
flavors
imparted
by
the
heavy
hopping
and
italian
chestnut
honey
whats
even
better
is
that
everything
is
wellbalanced
unlike
many
other
american
double
stouts
this
one
manages
to
be
complex
without
being
overthetop
overall
pretty
good
the
only
issue
i
see
is
the
peat
smoke
always
gives
it
a
weird
flavor
the
more
beer
i
have
with
peat
smoke
the
more
i
dont
like
it
in
beer
and
im
a
peatophile
when
it
comes
to
scotch
but
nice
flavors
otherwise
great
dark
malts
oats
light
nuts
and
spices
chocolate
and
roast
the
sawdust
flavor
i
think
comes
from
the
peat
smoke
but
not
sure
which
is
also
not
the
best
flavor
if
regular
smoked
malts
instead
of
peat
i
think
this
would
be
an
a
the
bottles
of
the
original
batch
are
still
dry
and
drinkable
and
a
splash
onto
vanilla
ice
cream
is
the
kind
of
beer
food
pairing
that
excites
my
gentleman
area
bottle
from
the
free
table
at
woodshop
5
0
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
is
licorice
black
malts
and
an
odd
note
that
took
me
forever
to
figure
out
but
that
i
believe
is
soy
sauce
i
wrote
fishy
in
my
initial
notes
but
thats
not
quite
it
flavor
is
much
better
with
tons
of
roast
and
vivid
dark
chocolate
peat
is
mild
and
i
dont
really
get
any
honey
caramel
and
chalk
make
an
appearance
thick
bitter
and
dry
overall
a
superb
example
of
an
imperial
stout
could
maybe
do
with
a
few
more
months
just
to
mellow
things
out
a
little
but
definitely
recommended
the
honey
and
hazelnuts
are
obvious
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
while
chocolate
roast
and
cocoa
dominate
the
flavor
yum
appears
pitch
black
with
a
milk
chocolate
head
theres
a
long
espresso
aftertaste
hot
damn
this
is
good
beer
theres
a
paler
malt
notes
that
pop
up
in
the
aftertaste
but
theres
a
whole
lot
of
roasted
malt
going
on
that
dives
into
roast
chestnuts
honey
and
spicy
british
hops
delicious
overall
quite
a
nicely
put
together
ale
reasonably
dear
at
au80
a
case
2012
but
i
think
this
one
is
worth
it
food
match
again
im
going
off
what
the
ale
was
like
when
i
first
drank
it
rich
foods
like
roast
lamb
beef
venison
with
heavy
gravys
and
lyonnaise
potatoes
with
yorkshire
puddings
and
glazed
carrots
good
though
not
exceptional
brew
to
start
off
the
evening
probably
not
one
id
return
to
very
often
if
i
were
lucky
enough
to
frequent
this
sydney
institution
but
certainly
worthy
of
a
good
pint
every
now
and
then
malt
driven
amber
ale
style
lightish
chocolate
tan
in
colour
reasonably
fizzy
palate
keeps
the
weight
surprisingly
light
for
a
6
7
beer
malty
chocolate
notes
come
across
the
palate
really
well
very
appealing
beer
best
of
the
marque
in
my
opinion
if
you
ever
been
to
aussie
then
you
understand
the
above
as
a
common
response
to
most
questions
anyway
the
old
admiral
is
a
nice
tasty
beer
not
to
strong
but
noticeable
the
aroma
is
sweet
malty
and
caramelly
color
is
a
dark
amber
with
nice
white
head
the
taste
is
ever
bit
what
the
aroma
was
hinting
a
very
good
beer
with
red
meat
i
would
give
this
beer
a
go
at
a
session
why
not
cheers
mate
drinkability
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
i
did
have
two
both
before
and
during
dinner
that
said
even
if
i
were
still
in
sydney
id
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
one
again
carbonation
is
too
high
for
the
flavours
in
my
opinion
d
one
6
pack
is
enough
not
again
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
with
a
lot
of
sugar
once
the
beer
sits
in
you
for
a
while
a
really
sweet
taste
begins
and
it
is
like
being
a
kid
who
has
had
too
much
candy
on
halloween
has
a
really
nice
look
and
smell
but
after
that
if
goes
downhill
quick
another
craft
brewed
australian
beer
that
fails
to
win
me
over
lots
of
flavour
full
of
character
but
i
suppose
i
have
been
spoiled
by
drinking
real
ales
in
england
this
is
far
from
a
bad
beer
and
it
is
streets
ahead
of
what
most
people
are
drinking
in
australia
vb
ted
corona
etc
but
still
falls
well
short
of
the
international
benchmarks
not
to
mention
offerings
from
little
creatures
james
squire
etc
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavor
but
they
are
a
bit
thin
this
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
half
finger
head
with
subtle
lacingit
has
aromas
of
burnt
toffeeroasted
malts
and
dried
fruitsit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
a
toffee
taste
first
up
followed
by
some
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
touch
of
hop
bitterness
towards
the
enda
very
well
balanced
beer
and
could
easliy
drink
a
few
of
these
i
missed
the
lord
nelson
on
a
trip
to
sydney
a
while
back
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
be
certain
to
get
to
the
pub
on
my
next
trip
this
would
be
a
must
try
on
tap
note
almost
seems
like
an
old
ale
and
certainly
a
night
cap
for
my
evening
d
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
a
goodlooking
decent
tasting
brew
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
an
ok
ale
for
a
winters
day
d
nice
enough
beer
but
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
ive
had
this
on
tap
over
the
years
through
a
few
different
brewers
and
recipes
the
first
release
in
the
bottle
was
disappointing
but
i
have
to
say
that
the
latest
bottled
batch
lives
up
to
the
memories
of
the
best
on
tap
at
the
lord
bottled
conditioned
hazelnut
brown
in
colour
with
an
off
white
head
great
nutty
english
ale
yeast
nose
with
roasted
malt
great
balance
of
hops
and
toasted
malt
flavour
a
bit
heavy
to
be
really
sessional
but
i
never
drank
old
admiral
to
be
social
the
bottle
is
6
1
big
malty
character
in
this
brew
its
really
chewable
rather
pleasant
there
is
a
high
sugar
taste
that
makes
it
a
little
less
enjoyable
as
you
continue
i
wonder
what
the
final
gravity
is
as
it
stands
its
a
reasonable
dark
ale
but
little
more
than
average
would
be
an
excellent
sipper
on
a
cool
evening
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
could
be
a
bit
stronger
on
the
malt
but
again
you
cant
falt
to
balance
of
these
brewed
they
are
very
decent
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
grainyness
with
some
toffee
mixed
in
as
well
i
also
get
some
earthy
hops
that
i
couldnt
find
on
the
nose
the
beer
finishes
clean
but
a
little
empty
the
beer
is
decent
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
still
worth
swingin
by
as
they
have
others
on
tap
to
try
has
a
bit
of
body
but
the
watery
characteristics
are
there
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
roastiness
not
enough
hints
of
coffee
caramel
chocolate
but
not
well
noticed
some
mollasses
but
generally
has
a
sweet
watery
texture
not
really
too
pleasant
to
drink
no
enough
balance
and
flavour
too
watery
beer
hd
higher
expectations
of
this
one
o
an
excellent
esb
very
drinkable
and
full
of
malty
goodness
with
just
enough
slightly
bitter
fruit
notes
to
keep
the
malt
from
being
overly
sweet
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
o
another
great
brew
from
wynchwood
lots
of
great
characteristics
that
are
typical
of
an
english
style
bitter
malt
forward
but
complimented
nicely
with
a
slight
bitterness
wynchwoods
hobgoblin
is
much
more
flavourful
in
my
opinion
but
king
goblin
is
quite
similar
but
with
that
added
alcohol
kick
i
recommend
beer
is
ok
and
acdc
are
showing
all
the
posers
in
the
audience
how
it
is
done
this
is
a
malt
forward
beer
with
notes
of
cookie
honey
toffee
and
some
toasted
grains
the
hops
is
very
subdued
but
tastes
of
grass
and
herbs
the
yeast
lends
flavors
of
dough
and
earth
the
scents
of
cookie
toffee
toasted
grains
and
earth
are
noticeable
when
bringing
the
glass
to
your
mouth
tastey
beer
should
try
it
one
of
the
best
from
this
brewer
lots
of
lovely
hops
waft
over
the
big
malt
backbone
tastes
quite
a
bit
like
bah
humbug
o
more
sophistication
in
there
than
the
nose
suggests
maybe
i
drank
it
too
cold
to
get
the
full
effect
would
recommend
as
it
represents
value
for
money
and
offers
a
notch
above
the
average
english
ales
of
45
abv
overall
if
this
brew
is
truly
only
brewed
under
a
full
lunar
moon
then
thats
awesome
this
is
not
really
of
any
benefit
to
the
substance
of
the
beer
but
it
is
still
an
attractive
gimmick
the
sweetness
is
there
but
unfortunately
it
isnt
solely
in
the
form
of
fruitiness
it
comes
more
from
residual
sugars
and
ethanol
making
for
a
harshfinishing
beverage
otherwise
it
is
hearty
enough
and
full
enough
to
keep
you
happy
and
warmed
throughout
perhaps
we
should
have
waited
for
the
full
moon
so
as
to
realized
its
full
potential
not
a
nice
beer
overly
bitter
and
lacking
in
flavour
compared
to
other
goblins
i
thought
age
was
responsible
for
the
of
flavors
but
other
reviews
indicate
otherwise
this
is
going
to
be
a
little
difficult
to
enjoy
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
o
its
good
and
on
the
right
path
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
alcohol
and
it
was
unfiltered
which
in
my
opinion
would
have
made
it
a
little
more
interesting
overall
a
decent
english
heavy
if
a
little
onedimensional
still
a
decent
sessional
beer
not
sure
the
price
is
worth
it
though
the
massive
import
taxes
in
australia
really
hurt
else
i
would
have
this
one
a
bit
more
often
this
is
the
regular
hobgoblin
on
steroids
serving
type
bottle
i
tend
to
favor
malty
heavy
brews
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
clone
of
hobgoblin
small
rapidly
diminishing
head
somewhat
lowers
the
visual
appeal
for
me
but
still
a
reasonably
priced
reasonable
ale
picked
up
after
my
fall
hobgoblin
purchase
good
feel
to
this
beer
i
make
no
secret
about
my
preference
towards
malty
sweeter
brews
and
this
sits
right
in
that
slot
for
me
if
this
was
brewed
by
some
fancy
dan
brewery
people
would
be
pontificating
about
it
for
ages
well
they
should
do
so
even
if
its
from
a
marstons
subsidiary
like
wychwood
overall
beers
like
this
are
what
sparked
my
interest
in
beer
very
nice
dark
beer
and
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
on
the
tongue
i
could
guzzle
down
a
few
pints
of
these
at
a
good
english
pub
any
day
overall
very
nice
beer
rather
enjoyed
this
one
and
think
its
the
best
product
ive
had
from
this
brewery
definitely
would
repurchase

o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
loved
this
brew
and
how
its

had

very

however
i
appreciate
the

it
out
not
as
good
as
the
other
common
brew
here
hobgoblin
but
very
good
indeed
overall
id
have
to
do
a
sidebyside
but
similar
to
what
the
hobgoblin
is
flavorwise
though
obviously
stronger
not
better
though
less
balance
in
this
one
more
brute
malt
force
leading
to
a
sweeter

attack
o

finished
with

and
overall
its
not

very

and
ill
buy
again
cheers
just
what
the
doctor
needed
during
a
cool
night
like
this
full
moon
or
not
mo
the
carbonation
level
is
generally
very
decent
well
complementing
the
rich
body
of
malts
and
fruitiness
but
the
palate
is
still
semilight
this
fullbodied
premium
bitter
or
strong
ale
is
richlyflavoured
and
decently
dryish
bitter
in
the
finish
easily
living
up
to
the
standards
of
wychwoods
craftsmanship
in
general
not
bad
o
very
solid
beer
for
not
a
lot
of
money
and
good
for
any
occasion
love
the
only
brewed
under
a
full
moon
schtick
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
amberrusset
topped
by
a
finger
of
wan
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
maple
syrup
light
brown
sugar
light
red
apple
skin
light
toasted
biscuit
and
the
vaguest
possible
sense
of
candied
orange
peel
this
is
a
strange
amalgam
of
general
fruitiness
sweetness
and
spiciness
diggin
the
complexity
even
if
it
means
i
cant
pinpoint
things
entirely
the
taste
continues
the
complexity
but
in
a
sideways
direction
hints
of
old
orange
rind
dusty
toasted
biscuit
brown
sugar
bad
carrots
dark
and
musty
greens
and
grass
its
a
sharply
painful
flavor
at
times
basically
taking
an
evil
mirror
to
the
elements
of
the
aroma
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
this
stuff
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
flavors
break
the
promises
made
by
the
smell
and
rub
my
face
in
their
deceit
o
a
good
beer
but
i
think
its
a
little
closer
to
average
maybe
slightly
above
my
first
couple
of
sips
i
thought
it
was
much
better
but
with
the
long
aftertaste
it
turns
to
a
bitter
coffee
still
a
decent
option
im
harsh
on
beer
ratings
so
maybe
im
rating
this
lower
than
it
deserves
d
its
ok
not
something
i
would
seek
out
food
match
i
know
the
festive
season
is
over
but
the
traditional
christmas
fare
would
work
a
treat
with
this
oh
well
next
year

a

with

that
persists

and

to
the

smells
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
hints
of
earthy
hops
provide
some
balance
but
this
one
leans
to
the
malts
side
of
the
equation
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
with
toffee
in
spades
along
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
batting
cleanup
hints
of
earthy
hop
flavor
burnt
sugar
and
mineral
water
attempt
to
provide
a
balance
to
the
sweetness
but
its
not
enough
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
decent
enough
beer
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
o
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
a
good
starter
for
those
getting
into
the
microcraft
brews
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
with
nothing
standing
out
but
still
enjoyable
imagine
drinking
a
newcastle
brown
ale
that
was
crossed
with
an
ipa
very
dark
red
in
color
not
much
of
a
head
tastes
very
rich
with
caramel
notes
but
is
yet
still
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
good
beer
to
curl
up
by
a
fire
with
during
the
long
winters
up
here
in
vermont
this
is
simply
great
stuff
and
in
my
list
of
the
top
english
strong
ales
to
date
o
a
good
beer
having
it
right
now
with
a
steak
sandwich
and
its
very
complementary
o
this
is
a
nice
english
ale
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
a
strong
ale
though
the
taste
starts
as
the
smell
indicates
some
residual
caramelized
sugars
but
theres
a
good
dollop
of
bittering
hops
which
take
over
the
flavor
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
a
blend
of
the
aforementioned
hop
along
with
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
very
rich
body
almost
oily
moderate
carbonation

i
used
to
love
hobgoblin
back
before
i
really
got
into
craft
and
was
mostly
drinking
british
ales
so
i
thought
id
try
this
for
nostalgias
sake
dark
ruby
red
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
of
malt
vinegar
hits
me
almost
immediately
and
this
is
what
i
usually
pick
up
from
british
ales
not
a
fan
flavor
is
very
fruity
malty
not
bad
at
all
overall
i
wish
i
had
my
5
back
because
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
anymore
o
decent
beer
to
try
i
never
picked
up
wychwood
until
today
i
may
give
their
wit
a
go
in
the
future
but
nothing
too
extraordinary
about
this
ale
for
a
fair
price
its
a
fair
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
if
possibly
miscategorized
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
quite
enjoyable
for
a
hot
summer
night
the
fruity
qualities
help
in
this
regard
the
beer
pours
an
amber
red
with
nice
amounts
of
carameling
and
some
yellow
along
the
edges
it
also
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
and
good
thick
lacing
that
dissipates
at
a
medium
pace
smells
of
sweet
malts
almost
an
apple
juicelike
smell
with
a
faint
hint
of
biscuit
in
the
back
tastes
again
of
sweet
malts
with
a
nice
caramel
backbone
and
an
ever
so
slight
tingle
of
hops
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
flavor
in
the
initial
swig
that
reminds
me
of
sweet
vegetables
unfortunately
that
is
the
most
specific
i
can
be
on
the
taste
its
swigs
nicely
on
the
tongue
a
bit
watery
but
with
just
enough
oomf
to
suggest
its
caramel
flavor
overall
this
is
decent
beer
im
not
as
taken
with
it
as
i
was
with
the
hobgoblin
the
wateriness
of
the
beer
is
a
little
disappointing
though
im
sure
it
holds
out
well
as
an
almost
sessionable
ale
overall
good
session
beer
in
taste
if
not
abv
o
this
one
is
everything
its
weird
little
brother
hobgoblin
wants
to
grow
up
to
become
a
very
solid
flavorful
unique
dark
english
ale
i
could
just
see
sipping
this
by
a
fireplace
in
some
quaint
little
pub
in
the
english
countryside
im
a
fan
would
recommend
if
you
enjoy
english
style
ales
o
probably
not
something
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
in
the
future
m
starts
balanced
and
shows
some
bitterness
or
to
say
it
better
is
a
bittersweetness
sensation
is
long
enough
for
a
good
ending
nothing
short
andor
simple
overall
they
definitely
oversell
it
a
bit
this
special
reserve
is
not
particularly
interesting
but
the
hop
profile
is
nice
a
good
bitter
but
nothing
more
than
that
a
malt
job
nothing
special
to
look
at
slight
amber
colour
neutral
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
caramel
light
toffee
light
toast
ok
drinkable
but
nothing
special
another
lcbo
choice
from
their
limited
palate
where
are
the
nice
balanced
english
ales
overall
boring
as
hell
poured
a
1
5
beige
head
with
moderate
lifespan
the
body
is
a
clear
deep
amber
the
smell
is
good
but
a
little
less
complex
than
hobgoblin
with
malt
and
toffee
the
taste
mirrors
the
malt
and
toffee
smell
plus
theres
lots
of
dried
fruit
and
even
a
bit
of
banana
esther
in
there
the
moderate
length
finish
highlights
sweet
toffee
not
slow
burn
bitter
hops
like
hobgoblin
all
in
all
i
like
it
i
just
find
it
less
interesting
than
their
hob
to
which
im
comparing
it
o
it
is
bold
and
delicious
and
much
better
than
hobgoblin
this
beers
better
than
hobgoblin
im
a
fan
of
traditional
english
beers
and
this
is
another
one
that
ive
really
enjoyed
o
very
mellow
brew
this
is
probably
my
favorite
from
wychwood
brewery
very
simple
also
nice
to
see
wychwood
using
brown
bottles
now
hopefully
their
other
beers
are
coming
in
such
bottles
now
too
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
quite
my
style
a
little
too
heavy
and
sweet
o
improved
a
bit
with
warming
great
strong
ale
that
was
enjoyed
by
myself
father
and
grandfather
i
dont
typically
come
across
a
beer
that
all
three
of
us
would
find
outstanding
but
this
was
one
a
traditional
english
ale
turned
up
up
a
notch
with
big
malt
and
a
assertive
hop
character
would
definitely
recommend
overall
a
beer
that
definitely
needs
to
warm
up
to
reach
its
full
potential
for
the
price
i
cannot
see
myself
buying
it
again
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
went
well
with
a
ploughmans
lunch
the
hops
in
this
are
interesting
piney
at
times
and
also
classic
english
bitter
and
are
well
balanced
again
the
higher
level
of
malt
well
king
goblin
ill
pay
my
respects
to
you
but
will
not
pledge
my
fealty
o
i
wouldnt
call
it
extraordinary
as
the
label
does
but
it
is
a
flavourful
and
easy
drinking
strong
ale
well
worth
a
purchase
o
a
tasty
seasonal
ale
some
unique
spiced
characteristics
definitely
worth
a
try
definitely
a
must
try

comes
through
again
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
touch
drying
but
sweet
throughout
as
well
medium
heavy
body
decent
drinkability
this
was
nice
to
try
but
i
dont
know
how
often
id
revisit
this
as
with
most
wychwood
offerings
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
ok
i
gotta
say
this
the
beer
is
nearly
5
bucks
and
frankly
i
cant
justify
doing
this
beer
again
at
anything
close
to
that
16
6
oz
so
yeah
im
used
to
the
premium
that
somehow
gets
placed
on
singles
but
it
is
absurd
this
beer
is
about
the
same
price
of
bastard
which
btw
if
you
over
hopped
this
i
might
compare
it
to
i
hear
this
is
a
brown
ale
and
im
missing
the
nutty
flavors
i
expect
in
that
style
regardless
of
style
i
really
enjoy
this
one
half
point
deduction
for
price
overall
not
bad
provides
a
bit
more
of
well
everything
to
fill
the
woeful
void
of
character
the
standard
hobgoblin
harbors
perfect
concept
for
halloween
but
probably
not
a
beer
ill
purchase
again
king
goblin
makes
a
wonderful
beer
for
a
moondance
whatever
that
means
it
has
a
strong
and
actually
fairly
distinct
flavour
profile
has
a
certain
english
character
to
it
that
extends
beyond
the
overtly
earthy
herbal
nobleesque
quality
of
its
sovereign
hops
it
is
an
inherently
good
companion
to
dark
chilly
evenings
overall
an
above
average
beer
that
was
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
think
i
was
expecting
the
taste
to
be
a
little
more
bold
and
over
the
top
based
on
the
whole
king
thing
but
it
was
still
good
nonetheless
im
not
going
to
rush
out
to
buy
more
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
variant
of
the
hobgoblin
pick
it
up
if
you
like
robust
malty
english
strongs
body
seems
pretty
thin
yet
another
quality
product
from
wychwood
and
one
of
the
best
english
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
took
me
two
just
to
ba
ironically
the
others
ive
really
liked
lately
have
been
goliath
and
wychcraft
this
beer
had
decent
head
retention
decent
lacing
and
good
mouthfeel
nice
brown
color
a
nice
hop
profile
both
on
bitterness
and
tastearoma
good
bold
taste
and
well
balanced
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
buy
this
again
overall
another
nice
product
from
wychwood
m
light
to
medium
body
with
a
slight
chew
moderate
carbonation
this
appears
to
be
a
pumped
up
hobgoblin
its
labelled
special
reserve
and
has
6
6
alcohol
per
volume
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
fuzzy
head
kind
of
looks
like
a
cola
in
fact
the
taste
however
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
its
fine
it
has
a
chalky
texture
on
the
palette
its
a
big
bottle
so
theres
a
lot
here
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
very
drinkiable
and
tasty
totally
what
you
look
for
and
expect
in
a
english
ale
this
beer
drinks
like
a
3

if
you
enjoy
hobgoblin

will
love

it
definitley
won
me
over
as
i
kept
drinking
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
wychwood
o
ive
always
enjoyed
hobgoblin
as
an
occasional
treat
and
this
one
is
an
even
better
treat
i
really
like

been
drinking

lived

a

another
winner
from
wychwood
brewery
similar
to
the
staple
hobgoblin
from
wychwood
with
a
bit
more
flavor
and
kick
i
actually
enjoyed
this
more
than
a
hobgoblin
but
certainly
this
one
is
a
beer
that
might
get
a
bit
much
after
one
or
two
bottles
while
english
beers
are
not
my
thing
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
give
this
one
a
shot
as
well
as
the
other
fine
beers
from
wychwood
brewery
youll
be
glad
you
did

taste

and
a
bitter

finish
the
bitterness
is
very
dry
and
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
clean
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
unexpected
fruity
flavor
however
the
bitterness
on
this
one
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
o
its
my
fifth
or
sixth
beer
of
the
night
so
my
description
is
probably
a
little
lacking
i
enjoyed
finding
this
and
enjoyed
drinking
it
well
balanced
but
it
can
be
a
little
overly
sweet
at
times
good
beer
glad
i
found
it
another
good
offering
from
wychwood
o
king
goblin
is
only
brewed
on
a
full
moon
so
yeh
its
kinda
cool
a
notch
above
6
5
this
king
can
cut
loose
not
as
malty
as
its
subordinate
and
a
nice
change
up
from
the
hobgoblin
but
personally
ill
let
the
king
have
his
swill
and
drink
with
the
grunts
a
very
nice
english
brown
ale
i
like
this
english
swill
o
this
beer
is
very
mellow
with
some
soft
dry
malt
and
soft
hops
being
mostly
bitterness
there
is
an
odd
character
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
that
could
be
age
or
ringwood
yeast
it
is
slightly
vinous
aswell
but
because
the
beer
is
so
soft
that
flavor
sticks
out
this
beer
was
really
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
than
a
strong
ale
and
for
that
style
it
was
about
average
i
will
always
remember
this
beer
for
its
name
which
should
obviously
be
david
bowie
the
goblin
king
yup
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
not
overpowering
the
carbonation
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
less
but
its
not
entirely
out
of
style
a
nice
richer
version
of
the
wychwood
classic
and
one
of
their
better
beers
o
this
is
one
of
wychwoods
better
efforts
a
very
solid
drinkable
beer
with
a
mere
6
6
abv
the
beer
is
much
more
akin
to
a
more
robust
english
brown
ale
than
southern
browns
usually
exhibit
but
as
the
trend
upwards
in
gravity
strength
and
flavor
continue
perhaps
this
is
the
new
stride
in
english
browns
and
wychwood
can
say
that
they
were
there
first
all
right
i
guess
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
head
some
lacing
all
the
down
the
glass
it
smells
of
toasted
malt
with
caramel
and
a
light
chocolate
characteristic
the
flavor
is
sweet
roasted
caramel
malt
with
good
balancing
bitterness
it
finishes
with
some
toasty
toffee
accented
bitterness
this
brew
is
quite
enjoyable
smooth
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
back
end
its
been
some
time
since
i
had
a
hob
goblin
its
time
to
compare
it
to
its
big
brother
jh
this
is
an
excellent
representative
of
the
esb
style
but
it
isnt
unique
enough
for
me
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
i
tasted
it
in
comparison
with
similartasting
fullers
london
pride
and
king
goblin
is
definitely
the
better
beer
but
not
by
a
ton
it
seems
a
little
pointless
for
me
to
describe
the
characteristics
of
king
goblin
because
id
just
be
parroting
descriptions
of
the
english
esb
style
it
does
have
good
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
tastes
malty
toasty
a
bit
solvent
this
is
is
a
good
esb
and
it
wont
jump
out
and
surprise
you
either
positively
or
negatively
features
a
mature
full
bodied
flavor
and
aftertaste
but
has
too
much
carbonation
especially
at
the
outset
light
in
texture
and
easy
drinking
complex
with
nice
balance
a
well
crafted
heir
to
the
hobgoblin
throne
a
nice
bitter
and
its
actually
bitter
beyond
that
not
much
to
say
o
drinks
very
easily
very
solid
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
i
could
picture
myself
drinking
pints
upon
pints
of
this
stuff
at
a
pub
in
england
all
day
then
stumbling
my
way
back
to
the
hotel
good
stuff
a
good
strong
ale
that
probably
will
gain
of
some
cellaring
oa
solid
esb
but
it
doesnt
meet
my
expectations
for
a
beer
that
is
this
highly
touted
by
the
brewer
it
needs
to
back
it
up
with
a
higher
quality
flavor
mouthfeel
has
a
lowmedium
body
carbonation
is
mild
at
66
abv
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
one
bottle
im
not
sure
a
second
bottle
would
be
a
good
idea
it
is
probably
a
good
idea
to
switch
things
up
after
this
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
that
can
make
for
a
session
beer
o
very
smooth
a
sippingbeer
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
wychwoods
hobgoblin
so
i
was
pretty
excited
to
see
this
king
goblin
special
reserve
i
really
like
the
coloring
of
this
beer
a
really
rich
deep
brown
the
smell
is
of
faint
spices
the
taste
is
a
strong
bitter
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
an
english
beer
makes
me
wanna
go
sit
in
a
pub
and
watch
some
rugby
grade
f
purchased
at
stoneys
4
99
bottle
overall
a
typically
english
beer
i
liked
it
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
bottled
strong
bitter
but
until
i
can
try
a
cask
version
of
the
king
goblin
ill
stick
with
hobgoblin
next
time
i
buy
a
wychwood
ale
a
full
grown
esb
much
taste
and
stamina
final
notes
a
very
good
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
not
exactly
a
session
beer
but
a
great
allpurpose
beer
nonetheless
i
dig
it
taste
is
wonderful
complex
balanced
with
nuttytoasty
bread
crust
dried
fruits
caramelized
fruit
grain
and
tea
with
a
lot
of
earthytea
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
along
with
wood
spice
and
herbal
hints
powerhouse
of
a
beer
i
want
more
d
an
english
ale
of
the
highest
quality
hobgoblin
has
been
a
longtime
favorite
of
mine
and
esbs
are
one
of
my
preferred
styles
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
and
more
sessionable
despite
the
6
6
abv
ones
ive
tried
now
hopefully
i
can
find
more
a
decent
esb
and
a
nice
one
off
from
wychwood
this
beer
tastes
like
im
drinking
an
antique
shop
but
in
a
good
way
it
also
tastes
exactly
like
its
color
and
its
color
is
something
that
takes
me
back
to
before
i
was
born
and
its
so
beautiful
too
it
looks
like
it
really
is
something
looking
at
this
beer
and
then
drinking
it
and
then
looking
at
it
again
and
then
drinking
it
again
it
helps
to
counter
nihilistic
perspectives
this
beer
is
that
sort
of
thing
verdict
superunique
offering
from
this
uk
brewer
is
sure
to
please
some
and
repulse
others
find
and
try
for
weirdness
sake
quite
possibly
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
if
you
want
an
example
of
how
beer
should
be
check
this
out
drinkable
albeit
not
quite
a
session
ale
and
good
enough
for
a
couple
of
pints
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
esb
im
not
overly
versed
in
the
style
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
im
glad
i
made
the
purchase
was
hoping
this
beer
would
redeem
this
tolkeinesque
brewery
in
my
eyes
but
it
has
unfortunately
only
reconfirmed
my
longstanding
impressions
drinkability
after
reading
the
other
reviews
i
may
have
just
gotten
an
older
bottle
that
was
not
preserved
well
but
was
fairly
disappointed
wanted
more
complexity
before
the
hops
hit
me
and
also
more
bodyhead
d
this
is
a
great
esb
much
tastier
and
drinkable
than
hobgoblin
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
well
balanced
english
esb
d
let
me
first
say
that
i
love
just
about
anything
from
the
eng
sco
and
roi
this
style
is
a
favorite
but
for
some
reason
i
dont
love
it
its
a
solid
esb
but
think
the
flavor
smell
could
be
a
little
more
accessible
give
it
a
try
i
could
be
wrong
and
hey
i
may
have
to
try
it
again
just
to
be
sure
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
find
the
extremely
grassy
finish
a
little
offputting
t
toffee
caramel
malts
with
a
slight
bitterness
very
nice
tasting
beer
dr
this
beer
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
but
ultimately
there
are
better
beers
to
be
had
at
this
price
point
particularly
here
in
ireland
dont
write
it
off
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
but
dont
expect
it
to
lift
your
skirt
up
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
slightly
slick
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
a
little
too
caramely
for
an
esb
in
my
opinion
but
still
a
quality
offering
d
glad
i
tried
it
but
dont
need
to
have
it
again

beer

liked

i

that

i
am

to
try
more

a

the
drinker
in

that

a
nice
occasional
treat
poured
my
king
goblin
into
a
glass
it
poured
to
a
very
deep
reddish
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
retained
well
smells
fairly
malty
smell
with
very
light
fruity
sweetness
in
the
background
tastes
great
malty
beginning
and
gives
off
some
great
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
that
finish
fairly
mild
nicely
a
great
backbone
to
this
brew
mouthfeel
being
a
fairly
strong
beer
with
alcohol
content
its
not
as
heavy
as
i
thought
itd
be
nice
and
smooth
overall
drinability
is
an
excellent
beer
for
these
rainy
days
weve
been
having
warms
you
up
nicely
and
tastes
great
note
apparently
the
first
beer
ive
given
straight
4s
interesting
but
in
keeping
with
my
experience
with
this
beer
everything
was
good
very
little
was
either
mediocre
or
excellent
take
this
as
you
will
d
hobgoblins
big
brother
although
it
is
available
year
round
it
is
a
good
winter
warmer
a
little
pricey
but
still
nice
to
have
one
every
so
often
the
style
seems
more
of
an
old
ale
than
a
combo
of
strong
ale
and
old
ale
a
classic
taste
and
worth
checking
out
i
will
try
to
find
another
bottle
repeatable
very
good
dark
for
an
ale
with
complex
spice
notes
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
these
are
limited
release
and
usually
go
fast
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
brew
and
i
can
definitely
see
it
serving
the
advertised
purpose
a
fall
evening
sipper
perfect
for
the
holidays
it
could
easily
fill
the
role
of
your
evening
belgian
nightcap
if
you
have
one
incredibly
smooth
very
well
balanced
a
little
malty
and
a
little
sweet
with
a
really
great
head
this
was
the
first
legal
beer
i
ever
got
and
ive
been
trying
to
find
it
again
ever
since
but
its
tricky
to
find
still
remains
my
favorite
beer
ive
ever
had
yeast
and
malty
brew
with
a
spiced
flavor
reminding
me
of
the
pumpkin
brews
in
a
way
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
everyone
that
did
beer
tastings
during
the
day
loved
just
the
right
amount
of
richness
and
flavor
not
too
heavy
but
certainly
not
light
i
wouldnt
want
this
with
turkey
its
too
much
like
bourbon
in
character
and
i
think
that
would
clash
with
turkey
and
mash
potatoes
but
its
really
good
to
sip
and
have
during
the
day
when
conversing
with
the
relatives
good
job
on
this
one
mayflower
well
done
enjoyed
this
bottle
and
will
share
the
next
with
a
friend
around
christmas
its
an
odd
flavor
not
at
all
hoppy
the
malts
are
all
there
its
not
bad
but
its
not
quite
my
bag
maybe
its
the
bitter
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
something
here
doesnt
quite
work
d
theres
a
bit
too
much
oak
character
even
after
a
year
but
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
its
just
not
all
that
special
if
there
were
limited
options
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
can
think
of
numerous
beers
id
rather
drink
first
o
thanks
e
i
really
liked
this
one
i
dont
think
ive
had
anything
quite
like
it
o
a
very
tasty
beer
unfortunately
its
8
and
only
comes
in
bombers
poured
into
my
lost
abbey
tulip
glass
pours
an
attractive
auburn
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
leaves
no
lacing
behind
smell
is
bread
vanilla
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
banana
taste
is
very
pungent
taste
is
all
of
that
with
some
toffee
and
booze
mixed
in
body
is
medium
enough
carbonation
not
dry
and
pretty
good
drinkability
this
is
a
different
and
good
beer
odgod
i
can
just
picture
this
next
to
a
cut
of
dark
meat
and
some
voluptuous
stuffing
i
have
avoided
this
for
about
four
years
after
trying
this
i
really
regret
the
wait
i
like
how
this
is
one
of
the
only
beers
i
have
ever
come
across
that
has
been
aged
on
oak
and
such
a
proclamation
hasnt
been
stamped
onto
the
front
of
the
label
overall
i
will
definitely
purchase
one
of
these
every
year
overall
a
really
nice
english
style
old
ale
the
balance
and
toasted
character
of
the
malt
really
seperate
this
from
other
beers
works
perfectly
for
the
season
too
and
priced
nicely
d
a
good
beer
if
they
tweaked
the
mouthfeel
this
could
be
a
great
beer
id
like
this
thick
and
chewy
personally
a
solid
offering
nevertheless
good
to
see
a
local
brewery
succeeding
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
deep
amber
color
body
with
no
head
to
it
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
the
tate
is
very
malty
and
sweet
it
also
has
some
spice
to
it
cinnamonallspicenutmeg
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
winter
time
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
has
some
problems
that
may
be
due
to
age
but
then
the
flavors
wouldnt
be
nearly
as
good
conflicting
on
this
beer
conflicting
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
kind
of
reminded
me
or
a
marzen
fruity
and
toasted
malts
with
some
oak
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
reddish
brown
appearance
with
a
red
tinted
tan
head
pale
malts
bread
grannysmith
apples
brown
sugar
off
the
aroma
fresh
hops
rye
and
wheat
bread
malted
barley
on
the
initial
sip
mild
hint
of
pears
apple
pie
spices
and
oatmeal
bitter
sweet
body
with
lots
of
smooth
malts
and
bready
flavors
i
was
excited
to
try
this
when
i
received
it
as
id
never
heard
of
it
and
it
looked
like
a
different
strong
ale
it
is
a
bit
different
belgian
yeast
isnt
all
that
apparent
while
the
skillful
use
of
different
malts
is
i
recommend
it
overall
while
there
was
much
in
this
beer
i
did
like
especially
the
range
of
flavors
i
found
the
bitter
dr
pepperkola
nutwood
notes
slightly
too
strong
at
times
reminding
me
of
biting
into
dandelion
stems
a
slightly
sweeter
touch
would
have
better
served
the
beer
showing
off
the
great
sugary
esters
that
lie
beneath
this
pours
the
color
of
burnt
sienna
a
ruddy
amber
with
a
solid
layer
of
foam
that
holds
up
as
it
warms
it
has
a
pleasing
malt
profile
that
reminds
me
of
an
english
mild
it
has
a
malty
mild
flavor
with
a
lingering
mouthfeel
some
sweetness
not
chocolateflavored
but
theres
an
interesting
intriguing
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
hot
cocoa
in
its
sweetness
and
finish
fennel
fenugreek
maple
cant
quite
place
it
but
i
like
it
this
is
a
good
beer
one
im
enjoying
enough
to
wish
i
had
saved
it
long
enough
to
share
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
rich
rubycopper
coloring
with
only
the
slightest
filmy
covering
of
a
head
aromas
are
earthy
and
richly
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
characteristics
on
a
toffee
backbone
smells
rich
the
beers
flavors
are
strong
and
rich
and
they
are
conveyed
on
a
fullbodied
creamy
mouthfeel
roasted
and
toasted
the
flavors
of
caramel
butter
nut
and
vanilla
shine
through
all
very
well
blended
and
balanced
with
a
grainy
flavor
lacing
throughout
interesting
and
surprisingly
drinkable
with
all
the
strong
qualities
there
is
a
hops
presence
that
reveals
more
into
the
aftertaste
with
the
roasted
qualities
combining
to
leave
a
slight
drying
effect
giving
the
beer
a
shortlived
somewhat
clean
finish
very
tasty
brew
and
would
likely
go
well
with
just
about
any
kind
of
rich
meaty
foods
like
say
turkey
o
good
big
beer
that
will
conspire
with
turkey
to
put
you
to
sleep
for
the
afternoon
which
is
good
because
the
cowboys
always
win
the
late
afternoon
game
so
why
bother
watching
seriously
screw
the
cowboys
o
this
8
abv
american
strong
old
ale
is
a
very
interesting
blend
of
an
oakaged
acidic
englishstyle
ale
like
mixing
an
english
barleywine
with
an
oakaged
american
strong
ale
and
funky
yeasts
if
this
is
what
the
puritans
were
drinking
maybe
settling
the
states
wouldnt
have
been
so
bad
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
good
clarity
and
bubbly
carbonation
it
almost
looks
like
a
soda
the
aroma
is
subtle
and
mellow
with
a
fine
mix
of
barley
and
rye
malts
sweet
sugar
and
a
downplayed
hoppy
character
the
body
is
medium
it
has
a
nice
taste
that
doesnt
make
you
think
too
hard
which
you
dont
want
to
do
on
thanksgiving
it
is
bitter
but
mildly
hopped
overall
i
found
it
to
be
nice
and
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
another
one
available
overall
a
nice
and
malty
treat
this
seems
like
a
super
spiced
up
dubbel
with
some
of
the
flavors
of
a
christmas
beer
i
could
have
a
pint
or
two
not
something
i
would
get
year
round
but
good
for
a
cool
night
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
heads
that
displays
minimal
retention
and
lace
smells
fruity
and
sugary
lots
of
toffee
and
brown
sugar
mixed
with
some
darker
fruits
like
cherries
prunes
plums
etc
slightly
earthy
aroma
is
able
to
just
barely
cut
through
all
the
malt
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
like
the
nose
suggested
im
picking
up
an
astringency
that
is
a
bit
unpleasant
i
cant
figure
out
if
its
from
the
wood
that
i
otherwise
cant
find
or
something
else
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
in
here
as
well
medium
body
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
fruity
syrupy
mouthfeel
mayflower
keeps
making
these
22oz
bottles
and
i
keep
foolishly
buying
them
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
its
all
over
the
place
o
a
high
alcohol
flavorful
complex
brew
that
is
also
ridiculously
drinkable
thats
something
we
dont
see
enough
of
a
good
choice
to
serve
to
craft
beer
loving
and
non
craft
beer
drinking
thanksgiving
guests
alike
this
reminds
me
of
fullers
vintage
ale
one
of
my
favorite
old
ales
a
side
by
side
tasting
will
be
interesting
pours
a
twofinger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
hoppy
nose
and
flavor
is
malty
caramel
with
a
light
pine
hop
finish

22oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
this
is
a
grownup
beer
bitter
from
toasty
edges
and
not
to
be
consumed
in
gulps
a
sipper
for
the
flavor
and
not
the
booze
wow
a
real
change
im
glad
this
is
in
a
bomber
im
going
to
grab
couple
to
hold
for
the
holidays
one
to
share
with
those
who
appreciate
all
styles
marketed
as
old
ale
and
i
can
see
it
as
such
1404
ill
give
some
thanks
for
this
nice
ale
the
american
strong
umbrella
is
sooo
big
though
definitely
not
an
arrogant
or
nosferatu
in
likeness
at
all
minutes
after
finishing
this
beer
i
can
still
taste
the
beer
writing
the
review
serious
lingering
flavor
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
caramel
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
notes
the
flavor
is
toffee
caramel
malt
yeast
and
some
dark
fruit
overall
a
decent
smelling
and
tasting
beer
but
there
is
really
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
relatively
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
pretty
nice
a
bit
thick
a
bit
seasonal
a
bit
confusing
but
i
enjoyed
it
thank
you
jeff
really
pretty
color
amber
with
lots
of
red
in
it
smells
hoppy
and
a
bit
boozy
tastes
fruity
and
malty
very
malty
a
bit
boozy
on
the
tongue
as
well
probably
should
have
some
more
age
on
it
fairly
drinkable
but
too
boozy
to
be
more
than
a
sipper
a
good
interesting
plethora
of
flavors
definitely
works
as
a
holiday
beer
has
this
with
the
turkey
this
year
nice
amberbrown
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
the
smell
was
fruity
with
caramel
malts
vanilla
and
oak
the
taste
followed
with
a
fruity
body
balanced
by
delicious
hints
of
spice
very
very
good
for
a
holiday
beer
or
any
cold
night
clear
tawny
amber
with
a
hint
of
haze
dark
beige
foam
mostly
a
collar
of
soapy
bubbles
with
a
thin
skim
of
fine
bubbles
coating
the
beers
surface
some
sticky
spotty
lacing
too
the
belgian
yeast
character
is
quite
upfront
in
the
aroma
bready
and
spicy
slight
banana
and
clove
but
the
caramel
sweetness
really
cuts
through
and
provides
some
balance
light
herbal
and
grassy
notes
perhaps
some
nutmeg
same
in
the
flavour
but
with
some
raisindried
fruits
and
sturdy
bitterness
providing
a
base
for
the
malt
and
yeast
banana
was
more
prominent
as
was
caramelized
sugar
alcohol
warmth
was
apparent
in
the
finish
but
not
strong
or
hot
nice
texture
medium
plus
body
with
fine
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
flavour
profile
was
interesting
and
nicely
balanced
a
decent
little
beer
for
the
holiday
the
oak
really
plays
a
role
here
and
will
determine
how
much
you
enjoy
this
beer
22oz
bomber
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
hint
of
orange
practically
no
head
save
for
a
small
ring
aroma
was
slightly
sugary
sweet
very
small
hint
of
alcohol
touch
of
caramel
taste
was
a
tad
bitter
up
front
but
mellowed
out
not
as
sweet
as
would
be
expected
a
small
hint
of
smokiness
not
quite
what
i
would
expect
for
this
style
felt
outstanding
in
the
mouth
coated
extremely
well
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
not
overly
strong
and
not
as
syrupy
as
some
interesting
blend
of
highalcohol
darker
dryish
malts
and
spicy
hop
in
the
swallow
the
alcohol
wins
out
certainly
its
not
an
everyday
beer
somewhat
thin
for
the
style
i
do
like
the
balance
of
the
aftertaste
d
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
of
8
i
could
have
three
or
four
glasses
of
this
with
a
dinner
or
even
an
afternoon
session
in
the
fall
i
certainly
look
forward
to
getting
this
one
again
when
the
opportunity
presents
itself
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
for
an
old
ale
glad
to
have
it
could
be
a
thanksgiving
tradition
poured
into
a
tulip
on
second
thanksgiving
courtesy
of
andy
thanks
pour
is
maple
brown
with
no
real
head
just
a
bit
of
opaque
white
foam
and
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
a
bit
of
scotch
somewhat
fruity
and
toasty
malts
not
bad
just
not
as
complex
as
id
hoped
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
toasted
malts
dried
fruit
kind
of
a
scotch
finish
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
nice
carbonation
and
a
little
bit
dry
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
nice
ill
enjoy
it
with
my
turkey
and
it
drinks
pretty
well
although
not
my
favorite
of
theirs
this
thanksgiving
ale
is
exactly
what
you
need
with
your
turkey
its
mild
enough
to
taste
everything
else
but
looks
and
feels
like
a
treat
drinks
okay
but
doesnt
quite
come
together
very
well
wants
to
be
a
smooth
drinker
but
stays
too
harsh
wont
pick
up
another
one
to
drink
with
thanksgiving
dinner
a
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
few
peeks
of
harshness
alcohol
trying
to
shout
down
the
maltiness
spicing
and
barrel
character
mouthfeel
is
good
with
nice
carbonation
even
after
the
barrelaging
and
drinkability
is
pleasing
as
well
on
the
lookout
in
2010
d
not
bad
solid
but
not
great
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
lot
of
substance
and
flavor
that
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
while
md
thin
and
not
much
of
a
body
to
it
could
drink
more
but
didnt
really
want
to
with
other
good
beer
available

sipper

the
holidays

i
see
it
again
if
youre
going
into
this
beer
thinking
old
ale

will
be
disappointed
the
beer
has
some
downsides
but
the
flavor
is
definitely
there
id
say
its
worth
a
try
at
least
once
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
light
tan
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hop
note
with
some
spice
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
some
hops
bitter
slight
smoke
note
medium
body
drinkable
a
very
tasty
brew
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
it
ive
not
been
dissappointed
from
this
brewery
yet
just
like
at
thanksgiving
often
times
the
best
part
of
the
whole
day
is
tasting
the
food
piled
onto
your
plate
mayflowers
thanksgiving
ales
real
selling
point
here
is
the
taste
as
well
the
malts
that
were
present
in
the
nose
really
are
exhibited
nicely
in
the
taste
with
a
rich
roasted
caramel
to
almost
cocoa
nature
in
play
with
this
ale
the
vanilla
that
was
present
faintly
in
the
nose
really
comes
through
nicely
in
the
taste
as
it
streaks
its
way
across
the
roasted
complexities
and
brings
out
a
bit
more
of
the
hops
and
oak
barrel
uniqueness
that
launches
this
ale
into
a
category
of
thanksgiving
greatness
lots
more
rye
than
i
was
expecting
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
oak
chip
aging
isnt
in
your
face
but
helps
blend
in
the
alcohol
very
well
anyone
that
loves
rye
ought
to
seek
this
one
out
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
full
finger
loose
foamy
off
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to
surface
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
behind
the
smell
has
an
appealing
complexity
sweet
malt
vanilla
cinnamon
oak
and
spices
supported
nicely
by
a
grainy
backbone
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
smooth
tangy
and
full
bodied
complimenting
the
taste
nicely
full
flavored
the
grainy
sweet
malts
vanilla
and
cinnamon
tastes
are
very
seasonal
8
abv
yet
really
drinkable
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
many
thanks
andrew
i
would
prefer
this
one
slightly
sweeter
or
at
least
better
balanced
and
definitely
heavier
on
the
palate
still
pleasant
d
fantastic
beer
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
after
thanksgiving
dinner
my
only
regret
is
that
i
had
only
one
bottle
and
did
not
have
this
with
dinner
well
done
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
every
thanksgiving
going
forward
i
will
do
my
best
to
have
a
bottle
on
the
table
2009
vintage
served
at
50
degrees
in
my
old
stock
snifter
poured
a
translucent
mahogany
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
quarter
inch
head
the
quickly
disperses
into
a
soapy
skim
and
a
cluster
of
bubbles
around
the
perimeter
of
the
bowl
no
lacing
on
this
one
mild
nose
definitely
getting
a
little
oak
and
some
sweet
malty
goodness
taste
follows
nose
also
a
little
creamy
and
toasty
with
a
touch
of
bittering
hops
coming
out
at
the
finish
and
a
lightly
lingering
somewhat
medicinal
quality
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
and
lively
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
tasty
with
a
wellhidden
but
flavor
profile
seems
a
little
nondescript
an
american
strong
great
local
treat
worth
a
try
22oz
bottle
happy
thanksgiving
at
dinner
pours
a
nice
darker
brown
nice
lookng
carbonation
i
can
smell
the
heavier
sugars
and
can
feel
this
one
is
gonna
feel
bigger
than
the
abv
sure
enough
a
thicker
mouthfeel
but
not
overwhelming
molasses
and
honey
finish
this
beer
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
worth
first
beer
at
the
table
drinkability
excellent
beer
that
tastes
great
and
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
more
flavor
than
your
typical
english
ale
and
a
little
sweeter
as
well
decent
abv
without
being
obtrusive
incredibly
easy
to
drink
this
has
the
makings
of
a
red
ale
on
high
test
the
beer
is
low
carbonation
clear
mahogany
no
lacing
or
retention
the
beer
is
quite
syrupy
too
the
nose
has
the
slight
chicory
aroma
of
a
red
coupled
with
phenols
some
abv
whiffs
with
some
liquor
soaked
florals
there
are
some
roasted
almost
charred
notes
in
the
taste
lots
of
crystal
malts
some
english
ale
yeastiness
there
are
also
some
caramel
in
the
taste
too
as
the
beer
settles
a
bit
there
are
definite
boozy
fruit
flavors
coming
through
this
is
a
nice
beer
tasty
a
bit
strong
a
little
bit
of
abv
makes
its
way
into
the
finish
but
overall
quite
respectable
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
in
the
finish
just
to
keep
things
a
bit
more
balanced
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
relatively
flat
slightly
syrupy
crystal
malty
ale
this
is
a
good
stop
the
drinkabilty
is
fantastic
for
an
8
abv
beer
this
is
a
fairly
straight
forward
but
finely
crafted
beer
and
as
for
pairing
with
thanksgiving
dinner
id
say
this
is
spot
on
though
i
havent
tried
it
out
yet
obviously
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
brown
with
a
cherry
oak
colored
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
pretty
clear
in
color
has
a
cream
colored
head
that
was
about
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
that
goes
away
fairly
quickly
when
its
gone
it
produces
a
ring
around
the
edges
with
minimal
lacing
the
smell
isnt
what
i
expected
it
actually
smells
breadyyeasty
belgian
actually
and
almost
a
banana
aroma
malts
are
present
caramelized
has
a
very
slight
citrus
hop
that
you
really
have
to
search
for
the
taste
is
better
but
still
nothing
like
an
american
strong
ale
theres
still
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
however
heavy
on
the
malts
maybe
some
type
of
bourbon
or
scotch
flavor
to
it
very
yeasty
again
and
it
almost
seems
to
have
some
type
of
peanut
oil
aftertaste
there
are
some
hops
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
has
a
bitter
smokey
aftertaste
that
goes
along
with
the
previously
mentioned
peanut
oil
taste
with
all
thats
going
on
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
a
little
dryer
than
i
expected
but
good
its
pretty
drinkable
as
well
im
generally
a
pretty
big
fan
of
american
strong
ales
but
this
was
nothing
like
ive
ever
tasted
before
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
and
maybe
get
another
bottle
because
im
almost
not
convinced
this
is
what
it
was
supposed
to
taste
like
if
i
dont
like
it
the
second
time
it
wont
keep
me
away
from
the
brewery
though
thats
for
sure
cheers
d
this
is
a
well
balanced
well
blended
beer
goes
down
easily
and
another
solid
offering
from
mayflower
drinkability
one
bomber
will
be
plenty
im
about
halfway
through
and
im
thinking
i
wish
i
could
share
this
with
someone
else
to
savor
a
special
holiday
treat
that
should
be
enjoyed
as
such
it
is
great
to
see
mayflower
release
their
first
big
beer
in
bombers
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
this
last
year
on
tap
and
now
it
has
arrived
in
the
bottle
i
poured
it
in
to
a
duvel
glass
color
is
a
dark
rosewood
color
with
a
big
pillow
like
white
head
despite
the
color
it
still
maintains
a
lot
of
clarity
when
held
up
to
the
light
next
to
me
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
is
the
strong
wood
notes
in
the
nose
i
can
tell
right
off
the
bat
that
this
had
oak
involved
in
it
there
are
also
some
smells
of
peanut
butter
vanilla
toffee
and
a
hint
of
whiskey
man
that
peanut
butter
flavor
really
shows
up
in
the
smell
along
with
the
oak
chocolate
and
molasses
are
other
flavors
that
come
to
mind
when
sipping
it
comes
off
as
moderately
sized
with
the
malt
dominating
i
might
like
a
little
more
weight
drinkability
is
fine
but
with
the
large
flavors
and
complexity
it
definitely
is
a
brew
to
take
your
time
with
and
let
open
up
this
is
every
bit
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
last
year
perhaps
a
notch
or
two
better
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
speaks
to
the
history
of
new
england
great
stuff
here
from
mayflower
and
i
cannot
wait
to
see
how
that
barrel
aged
barleywine
turns
out
pair
this
one
with
thanksgiving
dinner
cheers
i
had
never
heard
of
this
until
i
found
it
on
tap
at
union
brewhouse
in
weymouth
very
muddled
taste
with
unknown
unpleasantness
hidden
towards
the
back
think
oak
smoke
vanilla
and
whiskey
yeah
it
didnt
really
go
together
i
like
the
concept
of
a
beer
tailored
for
thanksgiving
but
not
the
final
product
it
is
worth
noting
that
my
friend
liked
it
a
lot
more
than
i
did
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
tannins
and
a
sugary
dry
finish
i
drank
my
serving
of
this
beer
really
quickly
its
extremely
tasty
bordering
on
chuggable
a
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
that
did
not
disappoint
me
overall
a
very
nice
quality
seasonal
beer
very
sweet
and
quite
unique
from
anything
i
have
had
in
the
past
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
one
again
any
day
really
a
nice
offering
from
mayflower
great
drinkability
on
this
guy
even
with
a
nice
warming
finish
had
on
tap
at
moan
and
dove
the
appearance
was
really
perfect
a
dark
beautiful
clear
red
look
with
some
thin
lacing
aromas
were
really
really
really
good
sweet
vanilla
with
smoky
malts
and
alcohol
heavy
malt
and
vanilla
flavors
are
maintained
in
the
taste
of
the
drink
really
smooth
and
warm
structure
really
helped
me
warm
up
from
the
cold
new
england
night
overall
a
perfect
beer
for
the
thanksgiving
season
tastewise
theres
a
lot
going
on
very
light
carbonation
and
sweet
nut
flavor
make
it
seem
like
a
built
up
nut
brown
but
theres
a
lot
more
going
on
lots
of
oak
has
a
distinct
vanilla
bourbon
bite
too
thin
mouthfeel
despite
a
high
abv
thanksgiving
ale
highly
drinkable
md
i
think
this
one
is
perfectly
carbonated
not
too
heavy
and
is
something
that
i
could
sit
down
to
glass
after
glass
which
i
intend
to
do
right
now
to
finish
out
this
growler
great
drinkability
considering
the
alcohol
content
could
go
very
well
with
a
variety
of
american
fare
and
could
even
taste
great
on
a
hot
day
hopefully
i
can
snag
a
growler
for
thanksgiving
dinner
with
the
family
this
is
fantastic
i
need
to
get
back
to
the
brewery
for
another
growler
or
3
mayflower
has
hit
it
right
on
the
head
with
this
one
great
first
venture
outside
the
4
staples
this
like
the
others
are
top
notch
brews
i
picked
up
this
growler
at
the
brewery
these
guys
are
making
some
fantastic
beer
down
there
had
on
tap
at
union
brewhouse
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
darker
reddishbrown
very
thin
to
no
head
almost
looked
noncarbonated
good
strong
aromaa
i
get
oak
whiskey
and
some
vanilla
taste
is
similar
lots
of
booze
in
the
flavor
first
off
i
get
a
lot
of
vanilla
then
the
whiskey
someone
commented
i
think
someone
put
a
shot
in
my
beer
very
full
flavorwise
very
thin
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
if
it
is
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
though
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
only
7
7
its
strength
in
flavor
makes
it
seem
much
more
pretty
drinkable
though
i
had
2
and
will
definitely
have
again
sweet
fruity
beer
not
exceptional
but
also
not
bad
decent
complexity
but
a
bit
cloying
sweetly
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
and
completely
hides
any
traces
of
alcohol
its
quite
enjoyable
especially
if
you
like
aromas
and
flavors
of
fruity
yeast
o
caramelmalt
bomb
with
subtle
but
perhaps
above
average
complexity
for
a
red
ale
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
alcohol
taste
is
malty
caramel
slightly
sweet
a
hint
of
alcohol
some
molasses
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
taste
is
slightly
meaty
raisin
toast
a
bit
winy
with
pleasant
grain
caramelwiny
character
but
simple
thin
a
bit
watery
in
the
end
its
quite
simple
very
thin
a
bit
rough
and
bland
despite
som
pleasant
elements
o
overall
it
feels
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
smoothed
out
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
but
right
now
the
harshness
of
the
alcohol
i
a
bit
much
for
me
i
picked
this
up
because
im
originally
from
argentina
i
had
a
quilmes
once
and
it
was
garbage
i
read
up
on
regia
and
it
seemed
like
it
wouldnt
be
much
different
this
one
though
it
stuck
out
it
wasnt
bad
and
it
was
definitely
a
lot
better
than
the
tasteless
quilmes
lager
i
had
o
pretty
average
red
all
the
right
notes
are
hit
with
this
one
worth
looking
for
here
is
a
very
european
red
ale
its
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
all
malt
with
a
touch
of
yeast
and
alcohol
slight
toast
biscuit
very
sweet
almost
a
honeylike
scent
the
taste
is
similar
lots
of
malt
balance
to
the
sweet
side
with
serious
malt
flavor
not
really
roasted
but
rather
toasted
and
breadcrust
firm
mouthfeel
again
very
european
in
its
feel
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
certainly
a
forgettable
one
too
one
dimensional
for
me
and
even
though
i
can
appreaciate
diacetyl
the
intensity
became
overwhelming
it
was
a
fun
ride
the
first
8
ounces
but
then
i
was
ready
to
move
on
poured
a
1
5
offwhite
head
which
disappeared
pretty
quickly
looks
like
a
clear
glass
of
tea
with
just
the
faintest
hint
of
red
so
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
red
ale
smell
has
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
some
of
the
same
but
milder
and
with
a
little
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
finer
attributes
of
this
because
it
feels
kind
of
like
a
lighterweight
tripel
good
beer
just
not
a
great
beer
still
its
fun
to
try
something
from
argentina
overall
although
beers
like
this
used
to
be
commonplace
theyre
now
becoming
fairly
rare
outside
of
briton
im
not
sure
youll
find
anything
quite
like
this
and
this
is
from
argentina
how
weird
but
ok
i
love
it
its
loaded
with
flavor
and
character
and
despite
the
slightly
elevated
alcohol
you
could
easily
have
more
than
one
well
worth
seeking
out
i
agree
with
campuscrew
below
i
was
expecting
a
bit
higher
review
for
this
beer
when
i
wrote
it
up
before
visiting
the
site
o
a
solid
brew
overall
but
it
is
bordering
on
cloying
nonetheless
the
caramel
and
honey
are
delicious
and
the
brew
is
definitely
pleasant
d
not
a
terrible
beer
but
there
isnt
anything
particularly
exciting
about
it
and
its
just
simply
a
slightly
above
average
beer
for
me
would
drink
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
at
its
current
price
d
very
drinkable
for
a
such
a
large
beer
and
the
style
a
surprise
i
would
consider
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nasty
cloudy
color
kinda
rust
colored
i
guess
you
could
say
the
beer
tasted
more
like
like
some
kind
of
juice
it
was
very
sweet
also
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
after
several
hits
i
will
not
buy
again
pours
a
cloudy
dark
maize
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
grain
ciderlike
aroma
slight
metallic
hint
of
honey
and
a
hint
of
wheat
barely
fits
the
style
of
a
english
strong
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
grain
ciderlike
flavor
hint
of
honey
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
poor
appearance
and
lacking
in
aroma
and
body
aroma
is
rich
malty
and
yeasty
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
it
pours
a
clear
dark
coppery
amber
almost
mahogany
with
a
minimal
head
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
with
caramel
and
spicy
hints
and
just
a
little
honeylike
sweetness
texture
is
smooth
and
just
a
little
tingly
ok
give
the
folks
in
argentina
a
decent
chance
and
they
will
produce
a
truly
great
beer
pours
from
the
16
9
oz
bottle
which
appears
to
have
some
floaties
inside
yeast
i
dont
see
anything
on
the
label
indicating
bottleconditioning
a
hazy
apple
juice
colored
copper
with
a
1
12
finger
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
makes
quite
a
lot
of
fizzing
noise
on
the
pour
but
once
it
settles
there
are
a
quite
a
few
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
malt
caramel
and
apples
1st
sip
is
a
dry
apple
ciderish
note
followed
by
some
apple
and
caramel
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
on
the
swallow
with
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
thrown
in
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
with
a
slight
sparkle
on
the
tongue
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
high
i
could
easily
see
myself
going
through
these
one
after
another
on
a
football
sunday
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
it
appears
to
be
almost
nonexistent
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
ive
never
seen
or
heard
of
this
before
but
ill
make
sure
to
pick
up
more
of
this
on
future
beer
runs
drinkability
well
done
craft
beer
from
an
area
of
the
world
that
we
dont
see
much
good
to
see
they
are
getting
into
the
craft
kick
too
nice
beer
and
well
crafted
surprised
thi
sis
only
a
b
but
its
not
hoppy
and
only
hoppy
beers
get
rated
good
here
overly
sweet
buttery

honey
cloying
fruity
apple
juicebox
fairly
one
dimensional
as
the
carbonation
just
seems
to
ebb
away
leaving
it
lifeless
this
is
pretty
hohum
glad
it
was
a
freebie
thanks
sebastian
would
i
drink
this
again
yeah
definitely
would
i
buy
it
again
not
anytime
soon
at
this
price
given
the
small
number
of
reviews
it
looks
like
otro
mundo
strong
red
ale
isnt
available
to
most
of
you
either
that
or
you
passed
it
by
for
more
interesting
looking
ale
either
way
you
arent
missing
much
not
a
bad
beer
it
stands
up
pretty
well
with
the
other
english
strong
ales
ive
tried
but
i
probably
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
a
decent
brew
pretty
drinkable
for
7
5
percent
abv
its
balanced
with
lots
of
ale
flavors
to
stumble
upon
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
this
beer
seems
like
a
maltier
and
stronger
version
of
their
golden
ale
and
overall
just
isnt
very
good
i
was
overall
very
pleased
it
poured
a
clear
bright
amber
with
3
or
so
fingers
of
fluffy
head
and
decent
retention
it
smelled
and
tasted
malty
heavy
on
the
maplecaramel
and
light
fruits
apples
and
pears
it
was
medium
and
slightly
creamy
feeling
good
drinkability
with
7
5
abv
but
a
little
too
sweet
still
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
decent
beverage
the
aroma
is
sweet
like
malt
syrup
and
herbal
hops
the
appearance
is
amber
gold
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
its
like
cereal
with
maple
syrup
on
it
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
this
has
to
be
one
of
those
beers
that
could
use
some
help
because
i
get
the
feeling
it
has
potential
with
the
sweetness
and
not
heavy
feeling
after
drinking
this
beer
goes
down
way
to
easily
for
being
7
5
abv
pours
a
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
little
lace
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
nose
flavor
is
sweet
malty
with
hints
of
molasses
unusual
red
4
45
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
despite
minor
criticisms
this
is
interesting
flavorful
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
die
if
i
never
had
it
again
but
im
glad
i
took
the
chance
imbalanced
too
sweet
for
me
something
new
i
am
pretty
sure
i
had
any
argentininan
wares
before
last
nightthis
big
red
al
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
lighter
copper
color
more
than
red
with
a
very
thin
wispy
head
light
aromas
a
bit
of
toasty
grain
and
caramel
not
much
hop
presence
here
just
light
malt
aromas
a
near
watery
mouthfeel
kinda
killed
this
beer
not
giving
any
chance
of
big
malty
flavors
to
come
thrumildy
sweet
with
caramel
notes
as
well
as
some
firm
toasty
notes
but
its
quite
blazee
i
tried
it
wont
go
back
to
it
and
likely
wont
try
the
gold
a
clean
pale
orange
beer
has
a
small
fizzy
off
white
head
the
aroma
starts
with
a
vanilla
character
that
slides
into
a
caramel
note
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
background
there
is
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
that
masks
the
flavors
what
could
be
a
vanilla
caramel
note
is
quickly
washed
away
leaving
only
a
candy
like
sweetness
supposed
to
be
7
5
by
vol
but
the
wateriness
seems
to
hide
even
that
d
really
nice
drink
very
fruity
with
a
rich
caramel
sweetness
which
may
limit
multiples
but
nice
in
moderation
a
decent
surprise
from
argentina
not
my
style
and
kind
of
too
sweet
for
my
liking
this
beer
is
pretty
figgin
delicious
o
awesome
beer
from
block
15
this
one
gets
overlooked
because
of
previous
infections
but
should
be
seriously
looked
it
even
fresh
it
drinks
as
its
been
aged
for
years
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
you
like
winter
beers
a
little
extra
sweetness
but
awesome
beer
on
tap
at
beermongers
no
infection
noticed
so
i
cant
comment
on
how
the
bottles
taste
not
sure
if
block
15
should
have
released
it
even
if
it
was
with
the
buy
at
your
own
risk
i
prefer
when
breweries
dont
release
infected
beer
or
have
a
if
it
is
infected
we
will
refund
your
money
clause
o
this
was
clearly
an
infected
bottle
possibly
at
the
bottling
line
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
before
and
it
tasted
nothing
like
this
disappointing
would
be
an
understatement
pours
a
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
spice
and
brandy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
malt
dark
fruit
and
brandy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
and
spice
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
fairly
tasty
but
there
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
infection
going
on
with
this
one
o
its
getting
colder
outside
so
fruity
and
sweet
brandy
makes
it
sweet
a
bit
overly
sweet
but
great
flavors
drink
it
was
a
nice
idea
to
open
this
on
christmas
shared
with
my
brother
in
law
i
thought
it
was
okay
a
bit
let
down
that
it
didnt
meld
a
little
better
but
dropped
off
in
the
bottle
maybe
next
release
i
can
land
a
fresh
bottle
i
do
have
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
guess
ill
save
for
a
special
occasion
but
based
on
this
tasting
id
recommend
drinking
this
beer
now
so
you
at
least
get
some
of
the
spice
quality
from
it
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
suffice
to
say
its
very
aptly
named
fig
presence
is
very
apparent
and
it
works
well
with
the
other
flavors
present
here
a
unique
and
delicious
brew
in
every
sense
this
is
a
beer
that
rides
the
short
bus
special
never
had
anything
like
that
in
this
case
thats
a
compliment
wonderful
use
of
figs
great
barrel
presence
unique
complex
tasty
what
more
could
one
ask
excellent
beer
o
maybe
the
best
vintage
of
this
beer
yet
definitely
better
than
last
year
and
a
pity
that
they
werent
able
to
bottle
any
this
time
around
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
holiday
inspired
americanenglish
ale
the
sum
of
the
parts
spice
additions
barrel
aging
fruit
additions
are
all
done
in
balance
and
work
really
well
to
develop
the
overall
flavor
profile
for
such
a
big
beer
this
drinks
very
smoothly
definitely
a
sipper
but
an
enjoyable
and
not
overbearing
one
o
as
with
other
block
15
beers
im
at
the
point
where
i
like
them
but
im
not
blown
away
worth
trying
particularly
as
a
sipper
on
a
cold
night
but
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
to
acquire
unless
the
particular
style
is
appealing
o
0
really
enjoyable
great
meld
of
flavoring
almost
like
a
barleywine
i
really
loved
it
overall
not
as
desserty
as
i
expected
not
as
brandyy
as
i
expected
not
as
interesting
as
i
had
hoped
overall
this
beer
is
mild
and
smooth
and
easy
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
it
was
not
what
i
expected
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
a
heavy
sweet
dessert
beer
with
spiciness
from
the
cinnamin
and
nutmeg
it
was
my
first
english
strong
ale
that
i
have
ever
drank
so
i
will
just
call
it
expanding
my
palate
very
belgianquad
like
i
dont
know
it
was
alright
wouldnt
care
to
try
again
actually
thanks
for
the
share
brian
4daloveofstout
o
drink
great
sweet
and
fruity
but
the
brandy
balances
well
fig
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
i
liked
it
thanks
again
bbb099
were
edging
up
on
hyperbole
here
but
i
freaking
love
this
beer
the
5
im
about
to
give
it
puts
all
the
recent
4
5s
ive
rated
to
shame
and
that
includes
pliny
the
younger
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
drown
in
it
please
mommy
can
i
o
incredibly
sweet
beer
great
taste
for
the
high
amount
of
abv
o
good
but
it
caught
me
a
bit
off
guard
overall
pretty
good
unique
and
easy
to
drink
given
the
strength
and
richness
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
a
little
boozy
sweet
and
a
thinning
alcohol
on
the
back
end
the
overall
experience
of
the
beer
is
nice
a
little
biscuit
and
a
little
malt
sugar
syrup
a
nice
strong
ale
for
sure
id
have
it
again
everything
about
this
beer
is
above
average
but
not
great
there
are
a
fair
number
of
flavors
working
well
together
but
it
drinks
a
little
bit
light
and
has
a
light
body
if
the
flavor
was
a
little
stronger
with
a
fuller
body
i
would
like
it
better
pours
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
with
a
fair
bit
of
oxidation
theres
a
nice
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
maybe
some
brown
sugar
a
little
underwhelming
the
flavor
is
good
but
not
great
theres
a
mild
vanilla
and
oak
flavor
with
the
same
type
of
sweet
malty
notes
of
the
aroma
caramel
and
toffee
maybe
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
medium
body
with
smooth
carbonation
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
a
thin
collar
the
nose
brings
some
nice
fruity
notes
plus
a
good
dosing
of
spice
moderate
amount
of
barrel
character
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
some
stone
and
dark
fruits
plus
a
nice
bit
of
spice
and
spirit
mediumfull
body
with
a
bit
of
booze
interesting
and
fairly
tasty
d
overall
this
is
an
entertaining
and
interesting
beer
great
for
the
winter
season
it
is
mostly
well
integrated
together
though
i
think
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
a
thicker
mouthfeel
o
a
okay
beer
nothing
mind
blowing
or
impressive
i
really
wish
you
could
taste
the
barrel
or
the
brandy
there
was
no
hint
of
being
a
ba
beer
a
simple
thin
beer
just
not
what
you
would
expect
something
i
would
try
if
it
was
sitting
around
but
not
something
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
pours
a
murky
dark
amberbrown
with
a
short
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
frothy
ring
aroma
was
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
subtle
blend
of
oak
cinnamon
apple
plum
nutmeg
molasses
and
all
things
christmas
flavor
is
much
drier
and
less
sweet
than
expected
cinnamon
is
fairly
strong
though
out
and
cuts
the
sweetness
of
the
brandy
barrel
nicely
plums
figs
apples
and
light
cherry
fruit
flavors
throughout
and
a
dry
oaky
finish
medium
thick
body
smooth
and
creamy
throughout
not
nearly
as
spicy
or
fruity
or
more
generally
novel
as
imagined
but
the
balance
and
subtle
alcohol
presence
this
fresh
is
impressive
at
this
point
at
15
id
give
this
a
bb
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
to
high
level
of
carbonation
that
gets
very
frothy
inside
the
mouth
it
contains
a
nice
arrangement
of
flavor
but
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
and
overall
is
quite
good
for
what
it
is
overall
really
nice
strong
ale
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
little
disappointed
about
the
weak
brandy
presence
im
always
nervous
about
spiced
beers
but
this
is
exceptionally
well
done
o
perfect
beer
for
the
holiday
season
might
need
to
stock
up
on
this
one
im
afraid
of
what
would
happen
once
the
alcohol
and
carbonation
were
to
fade
this
beer
would
become
a
sticky
mess
o
a
really
nice
treat
for
xmas
morning
gave
to
my
wife
as
a
present
and
she
wanted
to
open
it
immediately
fortunately
for
me
she
shared
the
bottle
and
it
didnt
disappoint
great
christmas
beer
again
thanks
rob
for
making
this
happen
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
and
serves
well
as
a
winter
warmer
on
the
right
occasion
not
sure
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
but
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
this
beer
was
a
crowd
favorite
packed
with
flavor
yet
light
absolutely
wonderful
ive
averaged
my
impressions
for
the
two
and
if
reviewing
the
10
alone
would
have
given
a
higher
score
but
again
my
expectation
is
that
the
11
will
evolve
nicely
and
ultimately
end
up
as
the
better
brew
i
hope
overall
a
very
complex
beer
that
i
liked
quite
a
bit
in
small
quantities
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
this
is
really
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
and
would
probably
not
be
something
i
would
enjoy
any
other
time
except
in
the
dead
of
winter
regardless
this
is
an
impressive
effort
from
the
folks
at
block
15
a
challenging
and
tasty
beer
quite
nice
4
drinkability
such
a
complex
feat
of
delicious
brew
a
sippers
beer
lucky
to
try
this
elusive
brew
pours
a
rubydark
brown
head
stays
around
the
edge
with
no
lacing
smell
is
vanilla
figs
tobacco
and
booze
taste
is
excellent
figs
apricot
vanilla
maple
syrup
and
leather
dominate
with
some
alcohol
bite
and
mild
bitterness
to
balance
an
enduring
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
shines
exceptional
medium
body
and
smoothness
drinkability
is
good
with
the
booziness
and
the
abv
preventing
more
consumption
i
would
love
to
have
a
bottle
of
this
aged
the
best
block
15
beer
ive
had
nose
was
bready
well
spiced
cloves
cinnamon
ginger
and
light
fruits
the
initial
flavors
started
out
malty
very
sweet
toasty
and
nutty
but
really
turned
boozy
and
hot
towards
the
finish
definitely
a
brandy
kick
to
it
one
to
two
years
would
do
wonders
for
this
brew
other
notes
of
vanilla
apples
bittersweet
molasses
and
ripe
fruits
the
yeast
played
like
champagne
creating
a
very
dry
finish
and
a
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
d
no
doubt
this
is
fine
and
interesting
today
sure
its
a
bit
boozy
now
nothing
that
a
few
months
more
in
a
cellar
cant
resolve
however
review
and
scoring
will
be
revised
as
necessary
when
the
day
comes
that
i
open
a
bottle
for
now
just
seek
out
a
bottle
or
a
pour
only
64
cases
produced
and
limited
kegs
you
wont
be
disappointed
pours
a
pretty
amber
color
with
orange
highlights
without
much
of
a
head
sweet
aroma
of
pale
malt
candi
sugar
a
whiff
of
molasses

to
see
what
a

in

could
do
for
it
pretty
simply
nice
notes

they
dont
quite
mesh
well
together
ok

sort

gimmicky
and
not
really

on
its

i
think
others
have
covered
the

notes
here
not

more

heavy
not
really
getting

here
liken
it

becomes
a

definitely
worth
another
go
around
and
now
i
definitely
have
to
try
the

i
would
probably
not
drink
it
for

i
would

it

somewhat
disappointing
i
can
really
see
this
beer
except
for
the
hops
maybe
being
a
whisky
beer
as
it
has
some
whisky
qualities
to
it
albeit
weak
and
unsatisfying
but
if
its
distilled
d
suppose
this
beer
is
just
a
novelty
really
doesnt
look
appealing
to
me
lack
of
depth
in
character
and
flavour
really
made
this
one
to
forget
pass
the
beer
is
ok
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
cost
but
glad
ive
experienced
another
whisky
beer
i
am
sure
ill
really
enjoy
one
soon
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
the
whisky
elements
adds
a
different
dimension
to
classic
english
ale
style
goes
down
easily
and
a
few
of
these
would
probably
not
be
a
problem
reminds
me
of
innis
and
gunn
as
i
drink
it
if
you
like
their
beers
i
would
assume
you
would
like
this
nice
on
the
tongue
natural
carbonation
actually
a
nice
sipper
probably
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
with
a
nice
meal
md
i
can
now
imagine
why
the
label
recommends
a
cold
serving
for
this
ale
as
the
lack
of
complexity
and
certainly
underperformance
of
whiskycask
ageing
can
be
camouflaged
as
clean
and
even
integrated
if
not
entirely
original
idea
for
a
scottish
distillery
to
undertake
has
pretty
interesting
character
its
somewhat
dribkable
but

its

righteous
o
old

is
the
closest

ive
had
to
this
although
this
is
slightly
better
the
interesting
thing
is
that
its
almost
as
flavourful
when
chilled
as
when
its
warmed
up
this
is
a
somewhat
unique
brew
or
at
least
the
style
is
not
sweet
like
an
english
barleywine
such
as
the
superb
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
not
bitter
like
an
esb
and
nothing
like
an
english
porter
or
stout
although
it
looks
like
a
stout
it
starts
just
a
little
hoppy
or
sweet
but
grows
in
complexity
and
fruity
and
wine
characteristics
as
it
warms
in
fact
it
gets
better
and
better
as
it
goes
down
another
excellent
offering
from
a
superb
brewery
one
of
the
better
english
strong
ales
that
i
have
had
worth
buying
a
firstrate
effort
just
what
a
strong
ale
should
be
it
looks
lovely
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
rich
sweet
and
fruity
the
booziness
adds
depth
great
balance
and
a
smooth
body
a
perfect
sipper
for
a
winters
evening
the
age
of
the
bottle
clearly
did
this
no
harm
a
topnotch
brew
dont
pass
it
up
if
you
see
it
one
of
the
best
english
porters
awesome
a
tug
of
war
between
the
sweetness
both
fruit
and
chocolate
and
the
bitterness
both
roast
and
hop
with
the
sweetness
winning
ive
read
theres
some
impressive
hop
character
in
this
but
with
a
dec
15
12
bottling
date
that
was
never
going
to
happen
here
real
depth
even
some
old
ale
notes
out
of
a
historic
recipe
though
and
one
id
be
willing
to
investigate
again
fresh
first
off
a
porter
this
beer
is
not
sure
its
dark
and
well
thats
where
the
porter
comparison
needs
to
end
then
what
the
hell
do
we
call
this
thing
not
sure
actually
maybe
an
historical
english
black
ipa
it
is
pretty
hoppy
has
the
tell
tale
muted
well
traveled
old
school
english
hop
character
a
bit
fruity
a
bit
earthy
or
even
herbal
english
is
what
i
call
it
fairly
bitter
as
well
tastes
a
bit
like
chocolate
ok
score
another
point
for
porter
but
its
mild
smooth
nuanced
even
not
at
all
roasty
no
acrid
burntness
burntness
maybe
someday
it
will
be
a
real
word
its
sweet
chocolate
milk
chocolate
lite
hops
in
the
flavour
as
well
quite
hoppy
actually
or
perhaps
surprisingly
bitter
end
lingers
ok
perhaps
porter
might
be
the
best
place
to
put
this
thing
as
it
warms
the
roast
wakes
up
and
yawns
a
bit
before
going
back
to
sleep
also
i
have
no
idea
how
old
this
shit
is
really
fresh
im
sure
its
easier
to
define
maybe
ill
sum
it
up
here
its
very
dark
pleasantly
hoppy
has
some
nice
milk
chocolate
notes
faint
roast
bitter
and
sweet
at
the
end
its
a
super
bloody
strong
hoppy
english
porteresque
beer
oh
its
also
very
good
no
matter
what
it
is
it
is
warm
and
sunny
outside
as
i
drink
and
write
this
even
though
this
is
a
coal
fire
and
winter
brew
in
my
eyes
it
can
also
be
taken
during
the
summer
months
o
this
porter
is
quite
flavorful
but
really
sets
it
apart
is
its
drinkability
o
not
a
bad
english
porter
flavors
are
mild
but
well
integrated
and
balanced
smooth
and
drinkable
o
flavorful
and
goes
down
easily
has
some
qualities
that
overlap
with
a
baltic
porter
including
a
fairly
wellhidden
high
abv
readily
recommended
d
this
is
a
really
unusually
thick
and
dark
british
ale
with
spicy
character
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
winter
ale
like
the
other
j
w
lees
beers
i
have
had
it
stands
out
as
better
than
most
examples
of
the
style
and
it
has
a
rich
complexity
that
would
probably
do
well
with
extended
aging
o
manchester
star
is
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
it
is
easy
to
see
why
porter
was
popular
with
the
workers
of
industrial
revolution
england
this
particular
porter
blends
its
7
3alc
very
well
while
still
offering
nice
and
mild
flavor
its
nutty
slightly
smokey
and
meaty
flavor
would
do
well
with
most
food
a
small
negative
is
that
the
body
of
this
beer
could
be
a
wee
heavier
pours
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
a
tiny
head
aroma
is
a
nice
sweet
malt
with
roast
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
slightly
amped
up
english
porter
the
signature
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruits
are
everpresent
backed
up
by
some
milk
chocolate
and
just
a
touch
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
its
a
very
good
english
porter
poured
an
eighth
inch
of
mocha
head
which
vanished
fast
the
body
is
a
clear
burnt
umber
brown
almost
as
dark
as
coffee
it
smells
very
mildly
of
roasted
malt
and
im
not
picking
up
the
menagerie
of
other
smells
others
like
to
point
out
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
and
id
have
to
say
this
is
the
absolute
mildest
porter
ive
ever
had
its
best
attribute
is
the
body
which
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
a
very
sublime
english
hop
bitterness
sneaks
in
overall
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
doesnt
taste
bad
it
is
just
under
flavored
conclusion
this
is
an
excellent
english
porter
and
i
believe
it
is
the
strongest
example
of
the
style
i
have
tasted
to
date
i
like
it
is
actually
different
from
conventional
porters
and
stouts
and
tastes
like
the
original
style
is
described
man
what
a
classy
beer
o
this
is
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
english
porter
very
drinkable
though
this
is
a
full
body
beer
very
heavy
porter
this
beer
makes
some
stout
seem
light
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
but
is
way
to
heavy
to
be
called
a
porter
any
chocolate
desert
would
go
very
well
with
this
dense
mouthfeel
that
is
very
smooth
overall
great
brew
that
is
one
i
would
love
to
have
for
an
after
dinner
drink
would
pair
well
with
a
nice
mild
pipe
tobacco
taste
is
prunes
and
figs
in
brandy
dark
toast
dryish
toasty
finish
after
a
sweeter
fruity
and
more
alcoholic
start
it
has
some
dark
leafiness
and
woodiness
throughout
some
spiciness
it
is
not
super
complex
or
deep
but
is
wellbalanced
and
well
rounded
with
a
goof
firm
character
and
a
little
complexity
its
slightly
on
the
thin
side
light
for
the
abv
and
very
drinkable
o
maybe
the
bottled
version
is
better
but
the
cask
version
is
bland
and
watery
i
wouldnt
spend
money
on
this
beer
again

i
dont
drink
as
many
porters
as
i
used
to
but
its
always
nice
to
have
a
subtle
drinkable
example
d
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
a
cask
ale
not
sure
id
order
it
again
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
im
glad
i
ordered
this

of

such
a

in

pretty

mellowed

balanced
out
more
as
it

not
bad
but
too
much

and
not
enough
roast
for
me

good

licorice
mostly
some
chocolate
malts
not
very

understated
roast
and
that
bit
of
tabacco
that
remains
on
the
palate
the
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
with
some
subtle
fruit
at
the
end
looks
thick
but
has
a
very
light
body
kind
of
an
oily
texture
very
little
carbonation
makes
it
go
down
extra
smooth
not
a
fan
of
this
one
quite
a
complex
take
on
the
style
well
done
drinkable
beer
though
not
one
to
pound
all
night
in
my
opinion
i
would
enjoy
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
this
is
a
quality
product
that
many
people
love
having
said
that
its
a
little
too
much
like
drinking
molasses
water
for
me
mouthfeel
low
to
medium
carbonation
gives
it
a
smooth
texture
malty
sweet
with
the
dried
fruitfigs
and
raisins
coming
through
in
the
taste
as
well
a
froth
on
the
palate
barely
reveals
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
flavors
remain
the
same
with
some
of
the
alcohol
giving
a
mild
warmth
on
the
finish
when
i
poured
it
i
thought
it
looked
like
a
porter
and
apparently
it
is
does
not
mention
porter
on
the
bottle
that
i
recall
with
sub
zero
temps
outside
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
perfect
at
7
3
abv
i
would
also
enjoy
this
as
a
robust
cold
quaffer
not
sessionable
but
i
could
do
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
d
an
interesting
beer
with
a
robust
presence
and
could
be
food
in
another
time
and
place
a
bit
carbonated
and
heavy
for
a
daily
drinker
but
worth
a
shot
at
something
tasty
and
reasonably
unique
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
stop
after
only
one
of
these
this
is
a
quality
porter
from
j
w
lees
try
one
when
you
get
the
chance
drinkability
is
great
wow
am
i
loving
this
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
will
have
to
next
i
hang
with
simon
who
would
love
them
also
i
would
take
this
over
pretty
much
any
ris
stout
out
there
and
appreciate
the
price
and
reasonable
strength
this
is
really
a
fantastic
beer
without
even
considering
the
historical
tiein
and
back
story
i
love
how
satisfying
it
is
im
in
no
hurry
to
finish
this
and
would
surly
have
a
second
if
i
could
next
time
im
at
my
fave
packie
ill
very
likely
buy
a
bottle
or
two
unfortunately
the
price
of
this
import
dampens
my
enthusiasm
for
stocking
my
stash
with
too
much
of
the
same
brew
pours
totally
black
with
a
miniscule
browntan
head
nose
is
one
dimensional
molasses
and
malts
one
odd
thing
that
hit
me
on
the
flavor
vanilla
wouldnt
have
expected
that
with
an
english
porter
but
hey
garrett
olivers
name
is
on
the
back
label
this
is
going
to
bring
something
like
you
would
expect
it
to
as
an
american
to
the
nonamericans
this
is
a
prime
example
of
the
prowess
of
what
the
best
american
brewmasters
can
do
with
old
world
styles
just
be
ready
for
something
a
bit
more
feel
carries
a
slightly
thicker
liquid
body
carbonation
is
lower
but
its
appropriate
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
drinkability
exceptional
just
try
it
this
beer
reminded
me
of
what
was
available
several
years
ago
when
oldstyle
porters
really
started
coming
back
onto
the
scene
before
brewers
started
pumping
them
up
with
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
the
beer
has
a
pretty
substantial
malt
backbone
with
vague
coffee
and
unsweetened
cocoa
notes
in
teh
background
finish
is
firm
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
bittering
mediumbodied
milky
mouthcoating
and
just
a
bit
sticky
this
savory
drink
is
a
prince
among
porters
overall
a
very
good
and
robust
porter
good
representation
of
the
style
and
good
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
i
will
be
trying
again
i
think
im
missing
something
in
the
aroma
but
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
for
a
hearty
winter
dinner
d
a
great
english
style
body
with
a
great
drinkability
factor
hard
to
saay
how
old
this
bottle
is
no
freshnesss
date
on
the
bottle
but
it
was
pretty
dusty
when
i
bought
it
only
indication
is
the
back
that
says
this
was
brewed
again
in
2004
dont
know
if
has
been
brewed
since
or
not
definitely
some
sherry
aromas
as
i
open
the
beer
so
likely
it
is
a
little
older
pours
black
but
wwith
almost
no
head
even
with
a
hard
pour
smell
starts
out
sherried
but
quickly
opens
up
to
notes
of
cocoa
vanilla
and
sweet
malt
as
well
taste
is
somewhat
similar
definite
cocoa
and
vanilla
notes
and
quite
sweet
there
is
a
touch
of
sherry
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
and
a
low
level
of
carbonation
slightly
sticky
in
the
mouth
too
sweet
for
me
for
a
traditional
porter
and
not
very
lively
ill
go
somewhere
else
for
my
porter
fix
id
more
call
this
an
old
ale
even
then
id
like
a
little
more
bite
and
a
little
less
sweetness
from
the
500ml
bottle
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
brown
the
head
modest
and
creamy
tan
as
it
evaporates
the
lacing
provides
a
concealing
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
molasses
caramel
and
a
touch
of
earthiness
with
the
roasted
grain
present
start
is
rich
in
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
back
touch
of
bitterness
top
is
rich
and
full
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
benignant
acidity
the
hops
understated
but
noticeable
quite
dry
and
sweet
until
the
end
very
tasty
brew
malty
but
with
enough
balance
to
it
a
fine
one
to
sip
on
a
cool
evening
this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
roasty
and
robust
with
distinctive
notes
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
yeast
like
most
english
porters
this
beer
does
not
develop
any
real
definition
until
about
half
way
through
the
mouth
and
as
it
warms
up
to
room
temperature
you
notice
many
nuances
the
first
noticeable
taste
is
alcohol
followed
by
very
smooth
dark
malts
there
is
zero
sweetness
as
this
beer
goes
down
and
it
seems
as
though
the
sweet
malts
dominate
the
whole
tongue
overall
an
excellent
and
very
unique
beer
its
like
the
flavor
are
in
a
tug
of
war
but
in
a
stale
mate
i
can
see
that
some
of
the
scores
for
this
one
would
be
low
because
of
the
shock
of
the
sour
notes
but
if
you
like
lambic
and
porter
jump
on
this
one
d
pretty
high
for
a
porter
i
could
definately
have
a
couple
in
a
session
d
a
pretty
easygoing
beer
nothing
too
spectacular
about
it
but
still
solid
nonetheless
im
not
sure
this
is
good
enough
to
warrant
another
one
but
it
definitely
has
its
time
and
place
luscious
beer
full
rich
fetid
definitely
not
the
usual
porter
lots
of
character
huge
aroma
of
all
manner
of
dark
things
coffee
chocolate
dark
ripe
fruits
earth
burnt
sugar
old
leather
gnarly
beer
but
good
actually
a
velvety
texture
great
finish
very
close
to
the
commercial
description
love
to
try
it
on
draft
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
strong
kick
there
are
a
lot
of
qualities
of
this
beer
that
seem
to
border
on
the
baltic
porter
ris
styles
its
a
nice
beer
to
relax
with
sip
slowly
but
i
couldnt
really
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
beer
in
one
night
d

delicious
beer
that
has
great
flavor
and
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
id
be
likely
to
drink
it
again
that
said
it
does
not
fall
into
the
style
of
what
most
of
us
would
now
consider
to
be
a
porter
it
really
does
present
itself
as
a
sweet
and
strong
stout
500ml
brown
bottle
from
florians
in
auburn
completely
opaque
black
body
with
only
a
thin
film
of
light
tan
head
smells
of
burnt
and
caramel
malts
with
hints
of
black
licorice
burnt
malt
caramel
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
dominate
with
just
a
hint
of
black
licorice
on
the
finish
along
with
coffee
flavor
full
bodied
almost
to
the
point
of
chewiness
bears
some
similarity
to
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
imo
though
lighter
in
body
and
alcohol
slightly
and
a
bit
more
complex
fantastic
the
great
mouthfeel
and
complex
array
of
flavors
make
this
beer
a
clear
winner
ill
be
getting
it
again
a
new
favorite
porter
drinkability
a
really
interesting
combination
of
flavors
really
like
the
unusual
fruit
character
that
blends
with
the
sweet
malts
bottle
courtesy
of
hogtownharry
poured
a
light
black
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
black
chocolate
is
very
enticing
with
some
nice
english
malt
also
noticeable
taste
of
lightly
sweet
chocolate
malt
is
very
good
and
dominated
the
taste
spectrum
body
was
slightly
watery
with
some
medium
carbonation
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
it
is
lacking
a
little
something
to
be
truly
great
a
good
typical
english
porter
although
not
my
style
this
beer
is
a
deep
brownishruby
color
with
a
frothy
lightchocolate
head
the
aroma
is
enticing
molasses
and
malt
almost
a
maltsyrup
smell
with
dark
chocolate
alcohol
and
a
mix
of
fruity
esters
at
times
it
has
the
faint
aroma
of
booze
soaked
fruit
its
a
far
more
pleasing
smell
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
a
focus
on
the
malt
theres
a
little
toasted
bread
flavors
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
as
well
wonderful
complex
and
satisfying
the
carbonation
is
quite
restrained
giving
the
brew
a
smooth
body
with
medium
heft
its
very
drinkable
despite
the
sweetness
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
molasses
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
however
the
aroma
isnt
very
strong
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
i
anticipated
with
it
tasting
like
molasses
plums
caramel
and
chocolate
theres
also
a
small
coffeelike
bitter
finish
but
the
sweetness
overpowers
it
for
the
most
part
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
lowmedium
carbonation
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
the
alcohol
isnt
very
noticable
when
im
drinking
it
even
though
it
hits
you
later
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
ill
have
to
buy
it
more
often
had
this
brew
on
tap
last
night
first
time
i
have
seen
it
brew
was
poured
to
a
dark
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
chocolate
molasses
and
dark
fruit
like
cherries
which
seem
to
give
of
a
sour
like
flavor
ok
not
sure
if
this
brew
might
be
going
bad
but
i
had
noticed
a
strong
sour
taste
kind
of
like
a
flanders
mixed
in
with
nice
chocolate
and
charcoal
like
flavors
up
front
it
was
a
little
surprising
but
not
bad
i
actually
did
not
mind
it
too
much
over
all
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
do
think
it
may
have
run
its
course
and
the
ratings
here
will
show
that
i
will
have
to
get
a
bottle
of
it
to
compare
but
it
is
a
brew
i
would
get
again
as
even
though
it
had
a
sour
smell
and
taste
it
was
quite
complex
with
the
other
attributes
of
this
brew
from
the
bottle
poured
black
with
mahogany
tint
to
it
with
a
tan
head
aroma
a
slight
sourness
comes
out
than
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
brown
sugar
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
pops
out
along
with
some
dark
fruits
flavor
plums
and
orange
molasses
some
smoke
port
wine
chocolate
nutty
a
nice
dry
finish
enjoyed
this
one
manchester
star
is
interesting
beer
thankfully
its
also
good
beer
along
with
samuel
smiths
famous
taddy
fullers
london
and
original
flag
its
an
english
porter
to
be
reckoned
with
if
youre
looking
for
a
quintessential
across
the
pond
version
that
is
nothing
like
its
american
counterparts
give
this
one
a
go
tasty
stuff
notes
this
could
be
cellared
for
a
12
year
to
a
year
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
seeing
it
says

poured

sweet
burnt

smell
tastes
like

dried
fruit
raisins
and
a
little
bit
of
cocoa
overall
pretty
good
again
i
was
a
bit
surprised
since
i
was
not
expecting
a
porter
but
its
good
stuff
seek
it
out
i
have
to
admit
i
really
enjoyed
about
half
of
this
after
that
it
just
got
to
be
too
heavy
and
sweet
after
a
while
all
i
could
really
perceive
was
the
syrupy
nature
of
the
brew
good
to
split
with
someone
and
move
on
to
something
too
much
of
a
good
thing
i
could
probably
sip
a
couple
of
pints
before
the
fruit
juicelike
sweetness
got
to
be
too
much
for
me
lovely
smooth
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
taste
no

a
sweeter

version
of

london
porter
smooth
low
carbonation

drinkable
but
be
careful
of
the
abv
english
porters
are
generally
not
in
this
range
for
abv
and
this
can
hit
you
all
of
a
sudden
i
especially
like
the
mouthfeel
as
it
works
very
well
with
the
flavors
despite
the
low
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
english
porter
that
i
will
be
sure
to
revisit
d
high
unless
you
only
like
bitters
a
great
brew
to
me
very
similar
to
the
george
gale
festival
mild
ale
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
descent
tan
head
that
doesnt
retain
well
the
aroma
is
mostly
composed
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
dark
fruits
floral
hops
and
minerally
burtonized
water
the
taste
starts
off
with
expresso
and
milk
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
dark
fruit
plum
fig
raisin
burnt
bread
and
some
minerals
and
metallic
water
i
was
dissapointed
initially
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
traditional
porter
that
the
english
would
have
drank
in
the
late
19th
centruy
this
beer
feels
very
authentic
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
a
late
19th
century
english
porter

in
the

a
hint
of
leather
flavor

really
rich

malty

unique
in
its

with

excellent
malt
bill
that
adds
complexity
and
great
flavor
to
this
english
porter
its
sweet
with
a
warm
finish
a
good
drinker
this
brew
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
light
ruby
hue
but
ruby
nontheless
a
small
ring
of
head
sits
atop
but
no
real
head
formed
on
the
pour
the
nose
is
a
light
figgy
and
chocolate
with
a
light
burnt
character
but
everything
is
very
light
not
a
lot
of
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
a
little
light
there
is
a
slight
soysauce
character
with
a
slightly
dark
roasted
to
burnt
most
of
what
i
though
is
a
molases
flavor
not
too
sweet
but
very
full
in
flavor
the
feel
is
light
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
like
a
touch
more
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
nice
and
complex
tasty
brew
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
some
marshmallowdiacetyl
going
on
also
some
dark
malts
the
flavor
doesnt
have
as
much
dark
malt
character
as
i
expected
but
it
had
some
of
the
diacetyl
and
marshmallow
reminds
me
of
a
nice
sweet
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
just
short
of
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
good
drinkability

i
liked
the
last
sip
a
lot
better
than
the
first
this
one
kind
of
grew
on
me
in
the
hour
or
so
it
took
me
to
drink
it
if
you
love
porter
and
want
something
to
session
this
is
your
baby
bear
dwow
this
is
a
nice
smooth
beer
it
has
wonderful
malts
that
blend
together
but
are
not
overly
complex
a
good
solid
porter
that
has
a
nice
quality
but
shows
its
uniqueness
from
brown
ales
and
stouts
pours
a
small
dense
light
brown
colored
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
film
roasted
malt
aroma
mixed
with
some
vinuous
tobaco
notes
deep
black
colored
beer
with
a
ruby
hue
when
held
to
the
light
roasted
malts
some
cocoa
and
marshmallow
and
some
vinuous
tobacco
mix
and
mingle
up
front
soft
light
body
tons
of
flavor
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
storm
king
only
a
bit
sweeter
overall
this
is
a
really
intriguing
complex
satisfying
and
enjoyable
pint
that
would
make
a
great
finish
to
a
night
or
perhaps
an
afterdinner
drink
or
even
cigarbeer
very
nice
16
9
ounce
bottle
original
recipe
from
1884
pours
a
dark
near
opaque
brown
small
head
the
fell
to
nothing
after
a
minute
or
two
smell
is
smoky
smoky
chocolate
and
smoky
malts
taste
is
sweet
smoky
molasses
with
some
carbonic
bite
mouthfeel
is
unexpectedly
thin
but
the
flavors
provide
some
body
to
make
up
for
it
like
many
smoky
ales
one
is
plenty
to
drink
tasty
but
one
is
plenty
im
more
or
less
indifferent
of
the
actual
brew
it
is
drinkable
and
a
fair
example
but
my
wallet
holds
a
grudge
like
a
motherfucker
and
it
wont
let
me
buy
this
again
after
having
somewhat
high
expectations
for
this
brew
im
left
a
little
disappointed
i
appreciated
the
weight
of
the
empty
bottle
which
energetically
i
find
adds
to
the
rootedness
of
the
brew
cola
brown
with
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
the
aromas
remind
me
of
an
interesting
melange
of
things
tire
rubber
biscuity
malts
cocoa
weak
coffee
a
bit
of
smoke
and
more
the
taste
is
more
coffee
and
chocolate
than
the
aroma
leads
on
to
belive
but
the
malts
are
there
in
full
force
and
the
interesting
rubber
flavor
comes
back
on
the
back
side
as
well
well
integrated
and
nice
but
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
drinkability
remains
good
though
truly
an
interesting
brew
that
i
hope
to
sample
again
i
wonder
if
they
will
produce
casks
of
this
for
the
uk
market
one
can
only
hope
pretty
nimble
mouthfeel
considering
the
depth
of
the
malt
contributions
and
the
7
3
alcohol
i
would
love
to
come
across
this
on
tap
or
even
cask
conditioned
great
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nothing
was
overbearing
the
combination
of
its
features
really
made
me
wish
i
had
a
few
more
in
the
fridge
id
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
specifically
the
draft
version
brewed
in
lake
placid
the
bottle
doesnt
compare
o
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
chilly
day
in
nyc
great
finish
o
a
strong
ale
that
doesnt
really
shine
in
the
flavor
department
it
is
certainly
strong
in
some
aspects
but
unbalanced
poured
into
pint
glass
from
bottle
very
dark
almost
black
like
soda
a
strong
aroma
and
taste
long
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
sticks
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
kind
of
a
earthy
flavor
very
low
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
will
try
again
poured
into
a
12
oz
tulip
glass
not
sure
of
the
bottle
date
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
minimal
lace
smell
is
toffee
biscuit
fig
and
molasses
taste
is
similar
toffee
and
biscuit
in
the
beginning
and
fig
in
the
finish
with
some
caramel
body
is
almost
medium
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
not
overly
dry
and
drinks
easy
enough
this
is
solid
for
the
style
o
tasty
beer
a
lot
darker
than
expected
interesting
earthywoody
flavor
that
lingers
with
a
back
of
the
tongue
finish
overall
a
friend
gave
me
this
beer
to
try
a
very
ok
beer
it
really
didnt
wow
me
or
impress
me
but
i
wasnt
turned
off
by
it
either
completely
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
when
you
want
something
thats
slightly
robust
but
you
want
only
one
overall
drinkability
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
great
hearty
example
of
a
strong
ale
tit
has
a
smell
that
is
very
different
from
the
taste
drinkability
is
ok
so
little
flavor
that
it
is
effortless
to
drink
but
its
far
from
inspiring
or
anything
id
want
to
drink
again
given
a
choice
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
found
myself
in
utica
ny
for
work
and
the
trip
wasnt
so
great
but
then
i
found
this
awesome
would
drink
again
for
sure
much
better
than
expected
the
best
from
this
brewery
then
again
they
dont
have
many
other
good
options
o
pretty
good
beer
nice
firm
taste
nothing
too
special
hides
the
alcohol
well
nothing
great
but
nothing
bad
just
a
nice
good
session
beer
for
my
tastes
poured
into
nonic
pint
glass
dark
brownblack
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
fluffy
brown
head
smells
malty
sweet
and
boozy
taste
is
similar
to
a
barleywine
except
with
an
odd
bitterness
to
it
almost
like
the
aftertaste
of
cheese
is
the
only
way
to
describe
it
it
works
with
the
style
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
its
drunk
a
delicious
and
hearty
beer
o
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
considering
its
strength
and
completely
hides
any
traces
of
alcohol
the
taste
isnt
very
complex
so
i
doubt
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
overallcomments
not
a
bad
beer
overall
although
i
was
a
bit
thrown
by
the
musty
aroma
the
flavor
contained
non
of
that
must
and
proved
to
be
very
appealing
classified
as
an
english
strong
ale

o
very
impressed
probably
in
my
top
15
beers
now
lots
of
great
taste
without
being
too
sweet
or
bitter
goes
great
with
food
highly
recommend
overall
a
very
good
malty
ale
highly
flavorful
o
nothing
to
really
brag
about
with
this
brew
it
was
a
nice
tasting
beer
i
poured
this
pretty
average
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
looking
color
the
beer
really
did
not
pour
much
of
a
head
though
the
taste
was
a
combination
of
caramel
and
roasted
malty
taste
that
was
not
too
bad
im
thinking
i
will
try
this
beer
again
and
hope
i
could
find
it
on
tap
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
would
not
try
it
to
often
overall
an
enjoyable
average
strong
ale
o
an
interesting
beer
that
sort
of
resides
in
the
middle
of
a
bunch
of
styles
american
strong
ale
english
strong
ale
a
hopped
up
american
brown
and
even
an
american
black
ale
along
the
lines
of
a
victory
yakima
glory
ive
had
this
beer
dozens
and
dozens
of
times
including
at
the
brewpub
in
lake
placid
and
was
surprised
to
discover
recently
that
id
never
reviewed
it
solid
stuff
a
very
nice
english
style
ale
overall
ubu
is
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
gonna
go
to
the
brewery
tomorrow
and
try
it
on
tap
im
in
the
area
very
tasty
and
strong
with
a
slight
aftertaste
that
you
expect
from
a
stronger
ale

dissipated
clung

chocolate
it
is
semisweet
throughout
and
hops
only
bitter
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
linger
is
just
about
right
this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
brew
that
must
be
tried
only
wish
they
sold
it
locally
o
interesting
in
that
it
is
a
lighter
type
of
strong
ale
i
could
see
this
going
well
on
a
cold
northern
ny
night
overall
4
0
very
good
to
excellent
strong
ale
this
is
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
a
stout
and
just
very
enjoyable
if
you
are
a
fan
of
unique
beers
that
are
actually
enjoyable
this
is
the
brew
for
you
if
you
find
it
buy
it
pours
dark
amberred
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
haze
and
ring
malty
aromas
of
toasted
grain
caramel
toffee
and
fruity
yeast
more
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
but
not
a
ton
of
unique
character
in
this
one
just
tastes
like
a
generic
maltforward
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
decent
enough
beer
overall
doesnt
reinvent
the
wheel
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
but
still
an
ok
beer
heavy
and
rich
but
worth
the
risk
of
trying
it
notes
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
is
might
be
but
still
decently
drinkable
cheers
overall
a
beer
i
enjoy
again
and
again
would
recommend
to
anyone
especially
those
who
enjoy
a
good
porter
this
beer
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
head
and
lastin
fine
lace
its
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
flavor
leads
with
coffee
with
dark
cherry
and
plum
notes
the
coffee
fades
and
chocolate
covered
cherry
comes
through
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
there
is
a
pleasant
warmth
in
the
finish
lake
placid
ubu
ale
is
a
good
beer
recommended
o
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
am
happy
i
have
more
of
definitely
would
like
to
try
more
lake
placid
beers
ok
not
must
try
not
bad
judging
by
the
bit
of
oxidation
i
taste
this
may
be
an
old
bottle
but
the
beer
below
is
still
quality
tasty
english
strong
ale
stuff
thanks
to
mjtiernan
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
a
new
beer
i
have
not
heard
of
yet
poured
from
bottle
into
dfh
snifter
pours
a
pretty
dark
brownblack
color
thick
off
white
head
sits
on
top
and
stays
for
awhile
nice
looking
brew
smell
raisins
prunes
brown
sugar
dark
cherries
taste
raisins
prunes
brown
sugar
matches
the
nose
well
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
makes
for
great
drinkability
nothing
too
complex
here
but
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
i
would
have
again
very
tasty
american
strong
ale
kind
of
has
some
belgian
strong
ale
qualities
going
on
as
well
though
it
is
not
on
the
label
this
is
very
scotch
ale
in
style
awesome
awesome
beer
the
flagship
from
lake
placid
now
widely
reknowned
as
da
bomb
pours
dark
brown
with
a
great
thick
tan
head
smells
like
english
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
very
english
in
nature
as
well
definitely
an
ale
more
happening
than
a
standard
brown
ale
but
with
a
similar
base
notes
of
tobacco
and
brown
sugar
are
present
as
well
the
thing
that
makes
it
interesting
is
its
complexity
and
uncanny
drinkability
for
its
abv
it
is
very
strong
beer
and
while
full
bodied
it
isnt
mean
and
nasty
in
the
gut
a
six
pack
will
get
you
shitfaced
long
before
it
fills
you
up
and
its
a
very
heavy
buzz
from
this
one
i
like
to
drink
it
year
round
but
the
fall
is
most
appropriate
also
delicious
in
a
bottle
and
ultimate
on
tap
at
their
brewery
with
some
of
the
parmesean
chicken
wings
lake
placid
does
a
really
nice
job
with
this
beer
like
i
said
great
for
its
price
range
and
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
and
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
rich
malty
taste
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
back
ground
nuttytoffee
caramel
taste
and
a
rich
creamy
feel
on
the
tongue
lake
placid
is
one
of
my
favs
and
this
beer
a
go
to
when
i
feel
like
drinking
a
six
and
catching
a
nice
buzz
the
mouth
has
low
carbonation
and
midlevel
heft
overall
its
good
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
definitely
worth
a
try
drink
not
a
huge
beer
by
any
means
has
a
good
profile
but
has
a
more
english
layering
effect
a
bit
thin
in
parts
but
still
tasty
dont
know
if
i
would
have
this
again
with
stone
arrogant
in
my
back
yard
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
liked
it
more
the
mouthfeel
was
smoother
and
a
bit
creamier
and
the
booze
was
tamed
a
bit
i
understand
the
bottles
are
contract
brewed
and
are
not
done
nearly
as
well
as
the
brewery
does
it
in
smaller
batches
eh
probably
wouldnt
order
or
buy
this
one
again
not
particularly
outstanding
o
the
flavor
of
this
beer
wasnt
the
best
and
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
work
but
overall
this
wasnt
as
terrible
as
some
people
make
it
sound
i
would
certainly
drink
this
over
a
large
variety
of
other
similar
tasting
beers
out
there
thanks
again
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
it
austen
had
this
at
the
lake
placid
pub
brewery
in
the
adirondacks
and
it
was
excellent
3
50pint
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
an
inch
offwhite
foamy
head
leaving
a
consistent
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
taste
was
also
sweet
slightly
bitter
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
7
00
abv
this
was
an
exceptionally
easy
beer
to
drink
thumbs
up
it
has
a
dark
yet
smooth
taste
and
feel
to
it
it
goes
down
real
easy
it
leaves
you
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
that
left
my
mouth
watering
it
was
definitely
the
local
kind
of
taste
i
had
been
anticipating
i
will
definitely
order
it
again
when
i
see
my
brother
d
second
sixer
of
oxidized
beer
from
this
brewery
oxidized
in
the
bottle
but
not
at
the
brewery
grrr
as
is
it
still
has
some
really
good
bits
but
oxidation
is
too
distracting
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
have
the
complexity
it
should
for
the
style
overall
very
enjoyable
the
big
range
of
scores
here
seems
to
indicate
it
isnt
consistent
though
too
bad
overall
a
decent
little
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
rich
creamy
brown
head
longlasting
with
delicate
lacing
very
beautiful
in
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
then
things
begin
to
go
poorly
the
beers
taste
is
malty
yet
overwhelmingly
dominated
by
roasty
and
strange
molasses
flavors
that
dont
mesh
well
overcarbonated
with
a
sharp
stinging
carbonation
i
was
pleasently
surprized
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
like
an
amber
ale
but
this
style
took
me
back
a
bit
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
malts
a
touch
of
yeast
taste
is
malts
up
front
some
hops
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
opretty
good
if
they
had
this
beer
around
here
it
would
probably
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
but
since
they
dont
i
must
continue
my
search
and
keep
trying
other
beers
this
is
a
fairly
dark
ale
perhaps
best
described
as
reddishbrown
the
flavor
is
malty
though
this
hoplover
found
the
nutty
taste
quite
palatable
and
somewhat
sweet
i
would
not
say
it
tastes
of
chocolate
but
it
perhaps
hints
of
it
the
hops
do
arrive
by
the
end
and
i
very
much
appreciated
that
balance
it
is
an
interesting
american
version
of
an
english
strong
ale
and
worth
a
taste
the
alcohol
content
is
robust
7
0
so
the
beer
has
a
kick
o
alcohol
very
well
hidden
personally
id
call
this
a
porter
with
a
high
abv
a
good
beer
which
i
enjoyed
more
on
the
second
sitting
4
0
overall
this
type
of
strong
ale
reminds
me
of
a
smooth
summer
time
drink
that
one
turns
to
when
theyre
feeling
extremely
dehydrated
im
sorry
but
i
like
my
strong
ales
to
be
well
strong
not
in
the
abv
category
but
according
to
my
smell
and
taste
receptors
oi
havent
had
anything
else
from
lake
placid
but
this
beer
is
decent
and
was
worthy
the
retry
o
really
nice
beer
from
lake
placid
here
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
that
i
hadnt
heard
until
about
20
seconds
before
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
overall
a
nice
beer
that
i
found
enjoyable
by
the
end
of
the
review
i
wish
to
note
approval
of
the
7
abv
which
took
no
time
to
warm
me
up
also
a
pleasant
surprise
very
decent
acceptable
brew
o
this
one
is
easy
for
me
to
find
here
in
ny
and
is
reasonably
priced
so
it
makes
it
a
nice
go
to
beer
not
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
however
if
someone
asked
me
if
i
would
want
one
i
would
definitely
take
it
can
drink
45
of
these
no
problem
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
a
big
malt
body
with
nice
hop
but
all
the
balance
is
towards
the
malty
front
a
good
beer
but
not
something
id
buy
very
often
o
d
interesting
pretty
good
malt
forward
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
certainly
not
hesitate
picking
it
up
the
next
time
you
see
it
enjoy
maybe
this
past
its
prime
either
way
this
failed
to
excite
me
i
match
my
friends
sentiments
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
not
impressed
this
is
a
beer
i
am
happy
i
tried
but
not
something
that
blows
my
mind
average
ale
certainly
much
better
on
the
market
this
beer
rocks
i
am
not
an
official
beer
tester
so
i
wont
try
to
impress
you
with
terms
i
dont
normally
use
this
beer
is
thick
and
tasty
and
that
is
what
im
always
on
the
hunt
for
i
love
this
beer
if
you
l
want
to
experience
what
i
believe
beer
tasted
like
back
in
the
colonial
days
and
before
mass
produced
watery
beer
became
the
norm
then
this
is
an
excellent
selection
highly
recommended
by
me
enjoy
recommended
taken
this
camping
and
woodsmoke
in
the
air
just
kicks
it
up
another
gear
imo
the
rest
body
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
and
drinkability
is
ok
the
balance
isnt
great
on
this
beer
drink
ive
had
this
previously
on
tap
and
it
had
a
really
pleasing
scent
the
bottle
didnt
seem
to
do
it
justice
still
an
above
average
beer
and
highly
drinkable
given
the
alcohol
level
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
touch
of
foam
at
the
top
but
very
little
chocolately
smell
malty
light
coffee
taste
mild
hop
throughout
subtley
carbonated
residual
cola
taste
very
drinkable
solid
beer
the
beer
was
really
good
the
rich
flavor
probably
would
limit
me
to
only
one
or
two
of
these
black
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
chocolate
malts
taste
is
cocoahops
and
sugar
cane
the
alcohol
gives
a
nice
warming
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
day
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
and
i
would
certainly
purchase
this
again
d
very
drinkable
not
a
session
beer
for
the
faint
of
heart
7
but
a
worthy
member
of
the
rotation
d
drinkable
def
very
tasty
as
strong
ales
go
this
one
is
a
98lb
weakling
i
thought
at
first
it
was
just
too
cold
so
i
let
it
sit
for
a
while
as
it
warmed
it
gained
nothing
the
aroma
is
thin
the
taste
is
flat
except
for
a
brief
peek
from
some
cokey
pepper
lake
placid
more
like
lake
flaccid
not
a
great
choice
easy
to
drink
and
paired
well
with
a
barbaque
dinner
nice
to
finally
try
this
but
where
does
this
fit
into
my
beerin
lifestyle
noteworthy
i
suppose
d
dont
really
care
for
it
much
has
a
funny
cheap
alcohol
taste
to
it
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
dont
intend
to
try
it
again
m
extremely
smooth
carbonation
is
appropriate
and
excellently
balanced
with
the
medium
body
of
the
beer
dark
brown
body
pours
with
a
half
finger
white
creamy
head
quite
pleasant
smells
sweet
and
caramelized
a
faint
hop
smell
some
musty
quality
too
overall
good
smell
tastes
starts
sweet
and
coating
medium
full
body
average
carbing
makes
this
7
slide
down
nicely
on
the
finish
there
is
something
that
i
cant
describe
better
than
funky
not
in
a
bad
way
its
interesting
and
tasty
all
at
once
id
pick
this
up
again
1
70
a
single
at
botw
rochester
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
beers
with
this
much
dark
malt
character
this
makes
it
a
very
easy
drink
rich
in
flavor
but
the
light
body
and
carbonation
makes
it
an
easy
one
to
put
down
one
of
the
best
beers
weve
got
here
in
upstate
new
york
im
disappointed
this
is
a
shell
of
what
ubu
ale
used
to
be
d
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
together
and
the
chocolate
malt
flavor
works
well
the
beer
is
overall
pretty
creamy
but
the
carbonation
is
just
right
to
keep
it
smooth
very
drinkable
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
brew
but
the
taste
just
is
not
enough
to
really
blow
me
away
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
there
are
others
in
the
style
i
would
pick
first
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
d
i
think
this
ale
is
quite
good
and
i
could
certainly
have
more
than
one
it
felt
great
going
down
nearly
fullbodied
with
a
creamy
taste
similar
to
some
other
american
strong
ales
but
mostly
just
the
good
ones
drinkability
takes
a
hit
from
the
high
abv
but
its
a
strong
ale
so
it
should
be
a
bit
higher
and
tastewise
this
is
a
repeater
this
is
an
exceptional
brown
ale
that
is
relatively
strong
but
very
easy
drinking
its
backbone
is
solid
roasted
malt
profile
but
is
not
overly
sweet
it
finishes
dry
and
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
alcohol
a
good
pick
when
your
in
the
mood
for
a
smooth
dark
beer
d
really
high
considering
the
abv
alcohol
hides
well
behind
the
mix
of
flavours
a
good
find
d
good
ale
an
easy
drinker
nice
way
to
end
the
day
not
exactly
a
normal
ale
and
more
like
a
stout
but
a
very
good
beer
which
ive
enjoyed
several
times
the
flavor
leaves
a
nice
coffee
aftertaste
and
this
beer
always
goes
down
easy
notes
what
i
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
is
its
finishing
flavor
after
it
has
progressed
nicely
over
the
pint
the
last
sip
leaves
you
with
a
nice
bready
malt
finish
that
was
great
d
an
ok
strong
ale
some
nice
fruity
malts
would
try
again
the
beer
pours
a
redamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
with
some
earthy
and
dirty
hops
the
flavor
is
toffee
earthy
hops
and
some
fruit
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
decent
but
nothing
special
i
enjoyed
lake
placid
ubu
enough
that
i
will
probably
give
a
couple
of
their
other
beers
a
try
ubu
is
pretty
unique
it
tastes
fairly
different
than
anything
else
i
have
had
which
is
something
i
dont
come
across
very
often
ubu
is
definitely
worth
a
try
dark
roasted
malts
develop
into
a
ruby
highlighted
brown
ale
hue
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
with
evenly
spread
lacng
aroma
has
dark
english
malts
very
earthy
and
herbal
tones
going
on
i
had
no
idea
what
ubu
was
but
its
named
for
a
black
lab
from
lake
pacid
ny
cool
nose
also
has
some
deep
cocoa
dark
chcolate
tones
with
a
flavor
that
adds
some
complex
earthy
bitterness
to
a
dark
roasted
english
ale
touch
of
peated
malts
and
somkiness
but
finishes
dry
with
herbalearthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slight
alcohol
caramel
streaks
across
the
palate
smooth
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
nothing
im
reaching
for
soon
somebody
visited
england
and
wanted
to
make
english
ales
in
lake
placid
listen
up
this
is
american
we
dont
have
to
brew
to
style
i
was
unsure
of
the
style
it
surely
did
not
taste
like
and
american
strong
ale
at
all
it
was
more
like
an
american
porter
which
it
did
have
decent
flavor
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
for
the
style
clear
brown
with
a
coppery
reddish
hue
and
a
half
inch
of
dense
yellowish
beige
foam
great
head
retention
lacing
consisted
of
thick
sheets
that
really
clung
to
the
glass
malty
and
fruity
aroma
caramel
and
faint
roast
chocolate
light
citrus
and
dried
fruits
a
hint
of
smoke
mild
bitterness
with
a
lot
of
fruity
character
up
front
some
citrus
and
plum
alcohol
malty
caramel
and
bread
towards
the
end
slightly
spicy
finish
medium
bodied
with
ample
creamy
carbonation
nice
texture
i
liked
it
d
good
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
my
only
reservation
is
the
lack
of
assertiveness
with
the
alcohol
dother
than
the
smell
the
alcohol
doesnt
really
come
out
which
makes
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
complex
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
the
taste
was
mild
for
a
strong
ale
butt
very
mild
for
a
beer
this
dark
it
had
a
very
nice
aftertaste
almost
nut
like
very
pleasing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
pleasant
dark
beer
if
you
are
on
the
stoutporter
side
of
life
for
the
night
by
all
means
fill
up
a
very
drinkable
dark
ale
7
99
a
six
in
a
12
ounce
brown
bottle
overall
somewhat
flawed
and
unbalanced
a
single
was
enough
decent
beer
but
not
great
this
strong
ale
has
a
nice
big
body
light
carbonation
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
englishstyle
offering
from
a
very
small
american
brewery
kudos
to
lake
placid
m
lightmedium
bodied
smooth
all
the
way
finish
with
sweet
malt
aftertaste
a
nice
carbonation
lends
a
hand
to
a
lightness
not
expected
from
the
appearance
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
the
highlight
of
this
strong
british
brown
and
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
a
pint
at
the
brew
pub
in
lake
placid
and
i
have
quite
often
then
youve
had
a
better
experience
than
what
comes
out
of
the
bottle
d
this
is
a
great
brew
i
have
to
say
i
try
not
to
buy
it
at
home
because
i
like
to
embrace
at
the
brewery
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
the
flavors
to
keep
it
tasty
i
highly
recommend
the
trying
of
this
it
embodies
the
adirondacks
as
the
flagship
brew
12
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
reddishmahogany
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
the
aroma
is
a
bit
light
for
a
7
beer
faint
notes
of
chocolate
earthy
hops
some
other
malts
the
taste
is
pretty
good
there
arent
any
real
standout
flavors
just
a
decent
mix
to
make
a
fairly
tasty
brew
some
smokiness
and
chocolate
do
peak
out
a
slightly
sweet
taste
and
a
hair
dry
finish
i
would
have
it
again
d
goes
down
nice
not
a
bad
overall
first
impression
of
lake
placid
not
sure
if
ill
have
the
ubu
again
maybe
on
tap
if
i
ever
run
into
it
but
im
interested
in
trying
their
other
brews
this
is
simply
a
nice
smooth
strong
ale
the
malt
overwhelms
the
palate
but
theres
some
nice
complexity
too
i
taste
some
butterscotch
undertones
along
with
some
toffee
chocolate
and
plum
has
a
nice
bite
on
the
aftertaste
but
goes
down
very
smoothly
drinkability
is
better
than
the
parts
in
the
end
it
just
feels
like
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
prefer
this
much
more
than
their
ipa
single
from
ye
olde
spirit
shoppe
frederick
md
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
cloudy
dark
amber
with
red
highlights
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
that
hangs
around
a
long
time
till
it
slowly
goes
into
a
thick
film
that
has
excellent
lacing
i
could
not
detect
much
aromawise
except
a
slight
woodiness
taste
is
caramel
sweet
and
citrus
tart
with
a
just
strong
enough
hoppy
bitter
finish
nice
and
crisp
highly
drinkable
this
brew
hides
its
alcohol
well
so
beware
overall
this
a
good
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
other
lake
placid
brews
in
the
future
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
into
a
unibroue
tulip
pinky
of
light
beige
head
slides
away
after
a
moment
aroma
is
mainly
of
dark
sweet
malts
and
mild
hops
along
with
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
slightly
roasty
mildly
sweet
and
dark
fruity
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
very
pleasing
overall
cold
winter
afternoon
perfect
time
for
a
stronger
ale
this
one
pours
a
rich
reddishbrown
color
its
dark
and
deep
in
hue
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
is
great
lots
of
malt
mixed
with
a
little
alcohol
resiny
wood
scents
and
a
slight
toffee
smell
nice
the
taste
is
a
lot
drier
than
expected
its
a
good
taste
but
the
malt
flavor
didnt
continue
retain
the
prominence
that
began
in
the
smell
good
balance
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
theres
a
firmness
and
full
mouthfeel
quite
a
good
beer
all
in
all
its
very
smokey
with
a
burnt
taste
black
porter
style
carbonated
and
crisp
taste
more
like
a
stout
or
porter
than
what
i
think
of
when
the
term
ale
is
used
but
outstanding
no
matter
what
the
title
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
strong
brew
and
i
will
be
drinking
plenty
of
it
as
i
have
just
moved
up
to
saranac
lake
8
miles
west
of
lake
placid
cheers
a
delicious
smooth
maltaccented
brew
growing
up
in
ny
ubu
was
one
of
the
first
real
microbrews
i
got
into
i
still
seek
it
out
when
im
home
a
great
winter
beer
notes
i
had
this
and
lp
46er
back
to
back
and
found
this
one
much
more
enjoyable
while
still
lacking
slightly
in
smell
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
nice
slightly
darker
ale
but
good
drinkability
md
medium
to
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
very
easy
drinking
drinkablity
you
can
get
a
6pick
for
around
8
dollars
which
is
a
great
deal
and
you
may
be
able
to
find
it
cheaper
almost
drinks
like
a
barleywine
which
means
you
can
make
this
last
a
while
recommended
brings
me
home
literally
sit
around
a
open
pit
fire
on
a
cold
night
and
enjoy
the
a
smooth
chocolate
ale
not
quite
a
chocolate
stout
taste
the
hops
but
not
overpowering
not
sure
it
matches
an
english
style
ale
but
a
taste
of
its
own
will
present
on
special
occasions
to
family
and
friends
this
was
a
great
extra
and
i
was
surprised
by
how
easy
this
drank
thanks
jeff
this
beer
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
dark
beers
and
to
this
day
is
my
favorite
i
brew
my
own
have
been
to
way
too
many
micro
breweries
and
this
one
is
still
the
staple
even
though
i
find
myself
to
be
an
ipa
man
for
the
most
part
i
love
this
beer
the
most
damn
all
you
who
disagree
this
dark
reddish
brown
ale
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
toasted
biscuit
flavors
dominate
the
flavor
profile
with
lighter
caramel
slight
chocolate
and
heady
alcohol
playing
a
supporting
role
the
nose
is
tingled
with
bready
malt
and
subtle
balanced
english
hops
aggressive
malt
sweetness
is
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
that
commands
attention
but
still
allows
the
malts
to
play
the
leading
role
flavors
are
strong
and
backed
by
a
sufficiently
heavy
mouthfeel
which
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
contemplating
the
passage
of
time
overall
pretty
interesting
i
have
to
admit
again
nothing
crazy
here
but
i
was
not
really
looking
for
crazy
i
could
do
this
one
again
for
sure
d
a
delicious
brew
id
definitely
recommend
this
beer
and
of
course
id
have
another
too
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
20991253
sampled
on
october
4
2009
the
pour
is
mainly
brown
with
a
frothy
longlasting
beige
head
but
when
held
to
the
light
a
ruby
red
hue
glistens
in
the
pin
glass
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
the
aroma
that
is
there
is
sweet
and
nutty
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
and
heavy
the
taste
comes
on
strong
with
the
tangy
note
of
bitterness
evident
in
english
bitters
there
is
also
a
hint
of
caramel
and
something
nutty
about
it
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
a
happy
hop
ending
helps
it
go
down
with
a
smile
a
fine
session
ale
and
one
that
deserves
the
many
awards
and
accolades
it
has
received
over
the
years
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
makes
this
a
nice
smooth
beer
to
be
drinking
drinkability
an
above
average
strong
ale
but
really
not
interesting
enough
to
merit
trying
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
jumps
out
it
almost
drinks
like
an
imperial
english
brownif
there
is
such
a
thing
one
is
enough
d
just
ok
for
me
alcohol
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
metallic
aspect
is
rather
distracting
for
me
think
this
is
a
one
and
done
not
bad
but
id
much
rather
go
with
something
else
for
my
next
beer
the
beer
had
a
typical
mouthfeel
and
was
drinkable
if
you
like
hoppy
ale
you
would
likely
find
this
very
drinkable
notes
i
would
like
to
thank
my
good
friend
don
for
telling
me
about
the
lake
placid
pub
and
brewery
and
for
recommending
the
ubu
ale
i
really
enjoyed
very
interesting
and
complex
ale
lingering
bitter
finish
made
me
want
another
immediately
i
suspect
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
too
many
of
these
an
unexpectedly
delightful
find
d
makes
me
wonder
if
i
have
a
bad
bottle
probably
will
try
one
more
to
make
sure
ill
update
this
review
appropriately
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
fizzy
colalike
head
that
lasts
a
good
long
time
the
nose
is
dominated
by
dark
roasted
malts
but
bits
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
and
a
touch
of
ripe
fruit
sneak
through
the
flavor
begins
with
a
sweet
fruity
character
which
slowly
evolves
into
a
rich
bitter
finish
the
aftertaste
is
mainly
of
bitter
hops
and
lasts
for
a
very
satisfying
length
of
time
its
a
tad
fizzy
for
my
taste
but
id
gladly
have
another
the
abv
wasnt
noted
on
the
bottle
and
im
surprised
to
learn
here
that
its
7
dangerous
if
not
known
ahead
of
time
palate
full
bodied
which
is
expected
for
the
style
tastes
of
dark
brown
toasted
malt
with
very
subdued
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
a
little
some
caramel
but
less
than
the
nose
indicates
bitter
aftertaste
carbonation
is
low
sits
well
in
the
mouth
drinkable
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
just
a
touch
too
much
malt
in
the
balance
to
make
this
a
real
quality
strong
ale
really
enjoyed
it
though
pours
a
dark
red
almost
black
color
nice
head
to
it
which
stays
consistent
all
the
way
down
to
the
end
good
amount
of
lacing
as
well
first
impression
of
this
one
is
that
its
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
definitely
hides
its
7
abv
well
and
is
very
drinkable
style
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
as
this
beer
is
aiming
to
be
a
british
style
and
tastes
like
it
but
i
guess
there
isnt
a
british
strong
ale
category
taste
wise
you
get
some
dark
fruit
kind
of
tastes
in
there
maybe
some
figraisin
but
other
than
that
tastes
like
a
british
pale
ale
to
me
nothing
too
extreme
here
but
is
a
nice
smooth
brew
with
some
subtle
taste
not
too
bad
then
we
get
to
the
taste
and
we
have
a
too
watery
too
bland
roasted
slightly
charred
overly
musty
slightly
biting
beer
that
doesnt
go
anywhere
the
finish
is
musty
as
well
a
bit
too
lingering
with
the
charred
brown
sugar
flavors
the
beer
has
a
burnt
toffee
flavor
some
overwrought
roasted
cherry
notes
the
taste
isnt
too
good
saw
this
on
the
shelf
at
perfect
pour
and
after
reading
the
description
on
the
bottle
opted
to
pick
up
the
6er
and
carry
it
out
pleasantly
surprised
nice
dark
brown
color
almost
colalike
initial
hint
of
dark
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
rich
malt
flavor
a
decent
hop
bitterness
and
an
almost
smoky
stoutlike
aftertaste
nicely
balanced
and
genuinely
good
tasting
well
worth
trying

is
small

it

light
floral
notes
lots
of
dark
sugars
some
burnt
grain

cocoa
backed

by
a
hefty
dose
of
bitter
hops
theres
some
fruitiness
that
mingles
with
the
roasty
flavours
and
a
bit
of
acidity
but
this
beer
is
mostly
about
the
roastiness
moderate
body
is
has
a
good
carbonation
level
and
is
fairly
drinkable
although
the
hopping
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
sit
ubu
sit
overall
its
a
pretty
interesting
and
tasty
beer
though
i
think
the
alcohol
content
is
a
touch
harsh
and
overdone
d
malty
at
the
start
and
boozy
at
times
may
limit
and
hinder
consumption
and
multiples
not
a
bad
beer
overall
just
not
session
material
and
perhaps
a
bit
unbalanced
warming
boozy
and
malty
and
perhaps
more
suited
as
a
winter
warmer
not
a
bad
beer
but
far
from
good
id
never
buy
it
again
im
ashamed
of
spending
10
on
a
6
pack
for
it
the
beer
poured
into
the
glass
to
reveal
a
very
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
mildly
of
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
the
taste
was
mildmedium
in
terms
of
sweetness
with
a
slight
roastiness
this
is
a
nice
ale
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
notes
and
comments
rich
maltiness
with
a
good
hop
balance
interesting
interpretation
of
an
english
ale
this
beer
was
brewed
in
tribute
to
a
choclate
lab
named
ubu
from
the
mountain
village
of
lake
placid
good
beer
very
drinkable
what
does
ubu
mean
anyways
d
nothing
special
here
i
dont
think
id
run
out
and
buy
bunch
of
these
put
then
again
probably
wouldnt
turn
em
away
like
the
ubu
itself
this
brew
is
dark
mysterious
and
a
mutt
of
sorts
doesnt
really
fit
any
particular
style
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
a
bit
subdoed
but
the
flavors
are
there
and
its
easy
to
drink
another
good
offering
from
lake
placid
good
drinkability
i
can
hit
these
all
day
in
all
weather
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
run
from
common
to
unusual
and
they
make
this
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
with
more
carbonation
i
might
find
this
a
bit
more
to
my
liking
but
again
interesting
brew
drinkability
no
probs
drinking
this
bottle
as
the
flavours
keep
pouring
it
on
with
every
sip
making
it
a
real
joy
to
drink
my
first
sample
from
lake
placid
and
colour
me
impressed
oh
and
great
head
retention
and
super
good
lacing
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
left
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
not
much
on
the
aroma
very
very
light
toasted
malt
aroma
and
very
very
light
hop
the
taste
has
a
sour
metallic
twang
lemon
rind
not
much
of
a
malt
presence
despite
the
appearance
a
touch
nuttywoody
not
much
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
definitely
has
a
sour
twang
thing
going
on
not
sure
of
the
strong
ale
label
though
i
know
it
is
a
bit
of
a
catch
all
category
needs
more
body
and
hop
presence
not
all
that
impressed
poured
a
dark
brown
smelled
a
bit
sweet
with
hops
tasted
a
little
sweet
as
well
with
a
touch
of
hops
but
not
too
much
of
any
flavor
ive
had
it
in
a
bottle
before
and
thought
it
was
very
good
but
it
is
better
on
tap
pours
a
semicloudy
mahogany
with
a
light
brown
finger
and
a
half
finger
head
that
takes
a
good
five
minutes
to
die
down
to
a
frothy
layer
of
foam
that
lasts
throughout
a
good
dose
of
chunky
lacing

to
the
sides
of
the

earthy
malty
and
nutty
brown
sugars
and
toasted
chocolate
malts
as
well

the
nose
overall
is
pretty
weak

really
need
to
dig
down
into
the

get
a
good
whiff
taste
starts
off
with
some
caramel
malts
and
roasted
grains
midway
an
unfortunate
minor
metallic
flavor
emerges
with
some
dirty
hops
as
well
aftertaste
consists
of
cocoa
powder
rye
bread
and
molasses
i
definitely
recall
the
flavors
being
more
rich
and
chocolatey
on
tap
shucks
medium
body
with
a
surprisingly
soft
feel
in
the
mouth
carbonation
is
a
tad
high
though
the
7
abv
is
hidden
pretty
well
but
the
bottled
version
is
nowhere
near
the
deliciousness
of
ubu
on
tap
its
a
nice
dark
brownamber
with
a
slight
tinge
of
snowwhite
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
woody
and
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
hazlenut
it
may
be
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
that
contributes
to
its
drinkability
despite
a
relatively
high
abv
its
easy
to
drink

the

was

the

i

it

with
toasted

toasted

a

the
toasted

notes
were
so
dry
it
reminded
me
of
a
baked
pretzel
these
notes
also
nicely
balanced
the
brown
sugar

caramel

flavors
that
became

a
botmc
that
has
been
aging
for
a
few
months
so
lets
see
what
we
got
smells
like
some
fuggles
and
tarty
hops
with
some
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
or
dark
candies
like
a
hopped

into
my
trusty
tulip
head
is
medium
bubble
color
is
deep
translucent
brown
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
heavy
taste
is
very
complex
starts
sweet
with
cocoa
and
tart
bitterness
then
gets
sweeter
like
brown
sugar
and
zestier
hops
with
the
carbonation
released
on
the
finish
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
too
high
and
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
and
masks
the
finish
a
bit
otherwise
this
a
very
good
hg
brew
with
nice
complex
flavors
d
i
love
supporting
ny
beers
i
just
cannot
recommend
this
one
if
its
the
only
thing
in
the
fridge
go
ahead
otherwise
try
something
else
d
not
much
alcohol
taste
which
makes
this
a
nice
smooth
beer
to
be
drinking
this
english
strong
ale
was
named
after
a
legendary
chocolate
lab
while
it
falls
short
of
the
lofty
standard
known
as

it
is
damn
good

love

ubu
ale
one
of
my
favorite
ales
ubu
is
a
dark
ale
that
has
a
rich
really
nice
finish
great
out
of
a
tap
or
in
a
bottle
the
brewery
is
in
my
town
so
this
beer
is
easy
to
find
and
on
tap
at
most
bars
its
a
good
beer
to
start
the
night
off
with
sitting
there
with
friends
enjoying
an
ubu
there
is
even
a
nice
story
behind
the
beer
about
a
dog
and
such
im
not
going
to
spoit
it
for
you
read
it
yourself
highly
recomend
if
you
are
in
new
york
look
it
up
mahogany
body
with
a
small
creamy
head
aroma
of
cocoa
and
nuts
a
fair
bit
of
caramel
joings
the
chocolate
and
nut
in
the
flavour
and
the
sweetness
is
cut
somewhat
successfully
by
a
decent
hop
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
concealed
so
this
is
more
drinkable
than
i
would
expect
for
a
strong
ale
medium
body
and
carbonation
deep
amber
colored
pouring
a
moderate
tan
head
that
seemed
to
fizzle
down
rather
quickly
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
flavor
is
a
mix
of
malts
with
some
chocolate
in
there
with
mild
hops
in
the
background
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
i
guess
this
is
their
flagship
beer
but
i
liked
their
49er
ipa
or
pale
ale
a
little
bit
more
this
was
a
gem
to
find
because
i
didnt
actually
trust
the
brewery
at
a
glance
but
i
came
away
satisfied
nice
dark
color
that
reminds
me
of
a
dark
brown
ale
great
aroma
of
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
malt
mmmmmmm
aroma
gives
away
the
taste
rather
than
disguises
it
the
palate
is
filled
with
chocolate
malt
roasted
nuts
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
7
abv
is
hid
fairly
well
leaving
a
content
drinker
behind
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
overall
quite
a
decent
product
not
what
id
look
for
in
a
session
beer
although
it
seems
to
be
their
flagship
on
balance
id
opt
for
the
ipa
as
the
best
offering
ive
tasted
from
this
brewer
d
this
is
a
pretty
simple
straightforward
beer
it
has
okay
drinkability
but
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
try
it
certainly
willing
to
drink
it
again
though
very
drinkable
i
have
one
more
bottle
and
it
will
be
saved
for
a
cold
winter
evening
in
front
of
a
fire
d
i
like
it
when
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
it
was
with
a
cigar
this
really
masked
most
of
the
subtly
and
i
wasnt
very
impressed
now
enjoying
it
with
just
some
popcorn
its
quite
pleasant
and
enjoyable
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
fairly
slight
head
smells
malty
and
fruity
with
cherries
and
grapes
very
fruitcake
like
delicious
beer
if
rather
simple
slightly
sweet
with
flavors
of
mixed
glaceed
fruit
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
citrusy
hops
in
the
mix
smooth
and
creamy
and
at
7
this
a
strong
ale
you
can
put
away
without
too
much
worry
d
that
aftertaste
became
somewhat
medicine
like
as
the
beer
warmed
all
but
ruining
what
started
out
pretty
well
beer

with

of
dark
sweet
malts
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
medium
bodied
and
it
glides
across
the
palate
fairly
well
drinkability
is
good
as
the
abv
is
well
hidden
this
is
definitely
a
unique
beer
it
is
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
it
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
coller
with
a
nice
medium
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
im
not
picking
up
much
on
the
smell
it
has
a
nice
malty
taste
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
drinkability
this
is
pretty
tasty
for
a
strong
ale
i
would
definitely
recommend
especially
out
of
the
snifter
mfd
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
sampled
on

this
beer
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
and
medium
bodied
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
very
nicely
all
the
way
down
it
has
a
very
sweet
malt
aroma
underneath
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
good
it
has
a
nice
deep
but
sweet
roasted
malt
base
that
is
the
basis
for
the
slight
hints
of
caramel
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
hoppy
bitter
taste
at
the
end
it
blends
very
well
together
and
is
a
bit
darker
than
most
strong
ales
on
the
market
which
makes
it
a
little
easier
to
drink
it
has
a
very
smooth
fairly
thick
and
warming
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
strong
ale
as
i
didnt
really
detect
the
alcohol
and
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
flavor
really
saved
this
beer
in
my
eyes
rich
dark
fruits
grape
plum
fig
resinous
hops
caramel
and
a
light
citrus
note
all
combined
to
bring
an
amazing
complexity
to
this
beers
flavor
profile
the
bottle
classified
this
beer
as
an
english
ale

i

it

just
come
out

say
it

not
be
a
doubledigit
strength
barrelaged
beer
that
twists
your

it
is

to
withstand

if

have
no

identifying
it

consider
picking
up
again
at

point
a

comparable
in
quality
to
the
other
three
brews
in
this
sampler
speckled

none
are
the
hallmarks
of
their

theyre
all

at

and
should
be

some
time
for
fuller

keep
those
white
bottles
away
from
light
not
overly
exciting
but
still
very
good
and
underrated
similarly
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
off
but
it
is
pleasant
as
is
the
overall
experience
i
am
pretty
sure
this
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
this
but
i
will
seek
out
others
wont
buy
this
when
i
am
looking
for
that
british
experience
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
certainly
look
for
more
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
oh
and
just
a
suggestion
drink
this
at
or
slightly
below

temperature
an
air

poured
into
a
true
pint
glass
a
very
nice

foamy

leaves

very

sticky

is

with

slight

note
the
taste
is
very
nice
sweet

with
a
touch
of
buttery
thrown
in
medium
body
the
finish
is
sweet
on
the
lips
dry
and
very
slightly
bitter
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
would
definitely
buy
again
when
in
vegas
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s

at
that
time
disregard
those
scores

hazy
dark

with

that
settles
to

patches

form
around

on

down
smell
is
of

fruit
and
slightly
sour
brettlike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
that
i
am
not
entirely
sure
were
intended
overall
this
beer
was
part
of
a
hen
house
4pack
from
morland
reviewed
old
crafty
hen
last
night
ill
rate
hens
tooth
a
bit
below
crafty
but
i
still
like
it
and
would
look
for
it
again
as
noted
above
proper
temperature
is
important
this
is
a
lesson
im
just
beginning
to
learn
o
a
bit
sweet
for
my
palate
making
it
decidedly
average
if
the
sweetness
was
decreased
the
hop
amount
increased
it
could
be
quite
nice
o
i
can
see
this
being
an
off
putting
beer
for
some
because
of
its
bold
flavors
but
this
is
much
of
a
novelty
beer
very
maltysweet
jammed
packed
with
fruit
for
the
most
part
its
a
good
english
strong
ale
o
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
bottle
conditioned
english
ale
but
something
a
little
stronger
than
a
pale
ale
all
in
all
its
a
fine
beer
i
suppose
just
way
too
restrained
and
i
dont
believe
extended
aging
will
aid
in
revealing
much
more
overall
drinkability
quite
nice
a
very
good
english
ale
good
with
food
bangers
and
mash
in
this
case
but
i
could
easily
have
one
of
these
by
itself
quite
dangerous
in
drinkability
i
would
easily
want
another
pint
of
this
i
suspect
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
fresh
on
cask
burnished
copper
with
an
old
faintly
yellowed
linen
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
crystal
malt
jolly
rancher
fruitiness
and
a
faint
whiff
of
english
hops
mouthfeel
is
effortless
and
smooth
with
a
slight
tickle
of
carbonation
taste
is
pale
malt
apple
fruitiness
and
a
mild
herbal
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
lovely
and
delicious
beer
that
i
eagerly
savor
each
swallow
great
stuff
odefinitely
better
than
i
had
anticipated
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
an
ok
ale
but
doesnt
fulfill
its
potential
the
clear
glass
bottle
is
an
obvious
nono
it
has
an
interesting
complexity
that
raises
it
above
most
greene
king
brews
but
the
harsh
bitterness
from
the
hops
spoils
the
balance
the
fruitiness
and
caramel
notes
are
nice
but
i
would
expect
a
strong
ale
to
have
a
more
maltdominant
character
aims
high
and
falls
short
its
quite
drinkable
and
i
would
have
it
again
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
once
o
an
easy
drinker
with
decent
complexity
not
so
clean
on
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
part
o
not
executed
well
avoid
this
bad
boy
i
thought
this
beer
was
ok
but
considering
i
bought
it
in
california
i
doubt
it
was
fresh
it
might
have
received
a
better
score
from
me
if
it
was
fresher
pours
a
beautifully
clear
caramel
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
seems
to
be
sticking
around
the
first
thing
that
hits
me
in
the
aroma
is
skunk
god
damn
you
clear
bottle
behind
the
skunk
i
get
some
smokiness
some
caramel
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
this
brew
is
just
above
average
too
skunky
and
too
one
dimensional
to
be
anything
more
than
barely
above
average
this
needs
to
be
bottled
in
something
darker
i
can
tell
this
beer
has
potential
but
the
sun
sure
has
damaged
this
one
worth
a
shot
but
id
only
get
again
if
i
can
find
it
on
tap
poured
a
2
12
offwhite
head
which
floated
a
lasting
merengue
on
top
smells
like
skunking
had
just
barely
started
why
do
so
many
still
bottle
in
clear
glass
geez
but
also
smells
of
the
bitters
and
some
malt
clear
dark
amber
body
taste
follows
the
smell
hints
but
stronger
and
without
the
skunking
theres
a
higher
dose
of
the
bitter
hops
and
even
some
hints
of
cocoa
butter
body
is
velvety
but
not
as
much
as
their
old
speckled
hen
dr
expensive
but
not
bad
id
have
it
again
maybe
in
the
uk
at
a
better
price
t
soft
sweet
biscuit
and
grain
up
front
which
blend
into
a
mild
flavorful
citricorange
hoppy
center
with
a
hefty
dose
of
caramel
that
isnt
too
sweet
due
to
restrained
wellbalanced
bitterness
in
the
background
thats
just
a
touch
harsh
really
smooth
overall
and
highly
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
restrained
on
the
hop
character
even
for
an
english
ipa
malt
character
is
also
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
dull
but
not
bad
and
the
balance
is
just
right
definitely
some
diacetyl
in
there
finish
dries
out
nicely
with
bit
of
a
bite
has
a
touch
of
iron
which
isnt
ideal
but
also
has
a
nice
lightly
fruity
citrusberry
edge
to
beady
malts
thats
very
pleasant
eventually
the
not
as
pleasant
metallic
character
wins
out
as
it
lingers
though
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
english
extra
strong
ale
as
an
aside
i
wonder
if
english
ales
are
under
pressure
to
conform
to
the
tastes
of
us
drinkers
and
make
them
all
hop
bombs
the
way

wines
have
succumbed
to
certain
reviewers
preferences
for
fruit
bombs
d
not
one
for
me
too
fizzy
and
for
its
strentgh
i
think
quite
a
bland
beer
green
king
not
my
favourite
brewer
by
a
long
way
greene
king
basicaly
calls
it
cask
conditioned
ale
in
a
bottle
and
it
definately
ake
me
think
of
many
english
cask
conditioned
ales
but
really
doesnt
fit
the
bill
might
be
better
in
a
pub
in
england
maybe
we
got
one
that
has
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
too
long
because
im
sure
that
at
the
brewery
the
beer
is
really
good
funny
beer
starts
good
and
ends
rough
i
dislike
the
finish
enough
where
i
wouldnt
chase
this
too
often
not
bad
but
not
great
drinkability
quite
high
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
but
overall
a
nice
brew
d
its
a
quality
product
but
i
dont
think
ill
waste
my
time
with
this
anymore
notes
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
good
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
plenty
of
toffee
malt
and
golden
fruit
give
it
a
definite
sweetness
even
though
it
is
bottled
and
a
clear
bottle
at
that
it
has
a
casklike
taste
to
it
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
sweeter
english
beers
although
the
cost
could
be
deterring
got
it
on
sale
myself
clear

malt
dominates
the
nose
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
hints
of
tea
tobacco
and
pennies
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
caramel
malt
but
as
it
warms
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
emerges
with
a
nice
mildly
tangy
fruitiness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
chewy
but
extremely
smooth
hugely
drinkable
a
great
english
ale
d
not
an
earth
shattering
brew
but
damn
tasty
this
is
actually
a
pretty
excellent
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
in
that
the
malt
is
really
the
controlling
factor
the
caramel
is
quite
noticeable
and
pleasant
very
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
doesnt
stay
long
though
theres
a
buttery
slickness
that
i
think
works
in
its
favor
mouthfeel
as
noted
is
a
big
problem
for
me
not
sure
if
its
just
this
bottle
or
if
that
is
how
this
beer
normally
is
way
too
much
fizz
in
the
mouth
as
far
as
drinkability
again
what
might
have
been
also
the

shines
through
a
bit
more
in
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
imparts
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
burn
going
down
at
times
d
overall
the
high
carbonation
and
and
metallic
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
make
this
not
that
great
of
a
beer
probably
would
not
have
another
drinkability
is
moderate
it
tastes

a
good
mouthfeel

easy

session
hens
tooth
is
an
english
ale
for
sure
malty
all
the
way
through
with
a
finish
of
bitter
hops
not
a
bad
brew
the
lingering
alcohol
like
flavors
make
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
but
finish
this
bottle
i
will
d
a
good
solid
british
pale
ale
some
hops
and
yeast
taste
complexity
that
adds
to
the
expected
malt
flavor
and
hops
bitterness
i
appreciate
the
effort
to
bottle
condition
but
i
cant
say
the
results
directly
translate
in
this
beer
it
seems
a
bit
too
carbonated
to
me
i
have
lived
in
the
uk
and
know
these
beer
fairly
well
d
smooth
with
good
body
nice
malt
profile
but
all
this
was
somewhate
ruined
by
the
skunky
aroma
and
flavor
get
rid
of
the
clear
bottles
clearly
a
flawed
beer
hopefully
just
a
bad
bottle
why
the
clear
glass
green
king
i
thought
this
was
an
interesting
and
unusual
brew
heavier
malt
than
i
had
expected
worth
a
try
is
it
fair
to
review
a
beer
that
has
some
skunked
qualities
its
easy
to
argue
against
it
as
the
beer
is
clearly
not
in
the
state
that
the
brewer
intended
but
its
also
true
that
these
bottles
represent
the
state
of
the
beer
in
the
wild
as
it
were
they
brew
the
beer
with
significant
hops
but
not
bad
really

poured
a
pale
orange
color
with
a
large
fast
dying
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pretty
plain
with
some
alcohol
notes
budding
in
from
time
to
time
the
flavor
of
this
reminded
me
too
much
of
a
malt
liquor
such
as
colt45
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
brew
very
much
poured
very
nicely
with
an
orange
hue
and
a
rich
head
that
disapated
quickly
aroma
is
dominated
by
malt
with
a
backgound
note
of
noble
hops
taste
is
rather
sweet
but
not
unexpectedly
so
especially
after
the
malty
aroma
hopping
is
light
almost
like
a
scotch
ale
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
silky
taste
is
initially
dominated
by
the
malt
with
hints
of
carmel
but
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
lingering
aftertaste
i
detect
no
off
or
sour
notes
as
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
i
find
it
pleasing
and
well
worth
the
money
but
that
said
it
is
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
tastes
so
i
would
hesitate
to
enjoy
it
regularly
an
orangish

between
apricot
and
copper

that
feeds

substantial

smell

pretty
strong
but
also
pretty
disappointing
faint
grain
and
alcohol
scents
are
overwhelmed
by
a
smell
that
is
perhaps
best
described
as
sour
that
sourness
carries
over
to
the
finish
which
is
both
dry
and
sour
thats
not
wholly
unappealing
mind
you
as
it
cleans
up
the
mouthfeel
grains
and
citrusy
flavors
at
the
front

then
a

also
coats
the
lips

with
a
massive

taste
was
a
basic
pale
malt
with
a

is
not
the
greatest

i
have

i
would
have

more

taste
but
its
not
the
worst
my
bottle
was
certainly
fresh
i
have
managed
to
culture
the
yeast

the
beer
was

getting
use
to
took
me
awhile
to
finish
it
didnt
help
that
it
was
a
full
pint
of
the
stuff
the
taste
had
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
but
was
covered
by
the
honey
i
liked
this
beer
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
barley
wine
not
even
close
but
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
i
had
this
with
my
favorite
fishnchips
so
it
accompanied
it
well
murky
copper
color
and
giant
creamy
carbonation
of
over
an
inch
in
height
laces
in
thick
gluelike
sheets
some
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
lots
of
skunkiness
with
maybe
some
weasel
musk
added
for
good
measure
medium
buttery
diacetyl
flavors
abound
here
possibly
the
beers
best
characteristic
some
sense
of
mown
grass
and
nutmeg
as
well
hops
are
harsh
and
extremely
un
subtle
at
the
close
drying
the
beer
harshly
i
dont
know
this
bottle
was
picked
out
of
some
just
put
in
the
fridge
at
thomas
liquors
but
alas
theres
a
big
sense
of
oxidation
yeast
gone
out
of
control
and
lightstriking
skunkiness
here
ill
rerate
some
day
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
but
the
head
was
totally
missing
it
barely
had
any
aroma
tasted
rather
bland
bad
carbonation
bordering
on
none
it
had
a
nice
color
but
the
flat
bland
taste
did
nothing
for
me
did
not
even
have
a
barleywine
taste
to
it
just
plain
bad
source
gift
me
cheers
a
good
beer
for
the
price
use
for
serious
contemplation
or
rustic
farmhouse
dishes
ive
reviewed
old
speckled
hen
tanners
jack
and
this
one
together
all
tapped
on
clear
glass
bottles
they
all
have
similar
characteristics
and
appear
to
have
been
brewed
with
the
same
kind
of
malts
and
hops
hens
tooth
comes
out
as
the
winner
with
the
most
pronounced
flavor
and
character
i
might
have
to
revise
that
statement
when
i
review
a
fresher
version
of
old
speckled
it
looks
like
i
got
luckier
than
other
reviewers
and
got
a
fresh
bottle
it
has
been
a
while
since
id
had
a
hens
tooth
this
bottle
was
an
overcarbonated
conditioned
bottle
and
gushed
when
poured
gently
initial
aroma
was
nasty
musty
and
metalic
like
something
gone
bad
great
head
retnetion
and
cling
cream
colored
and
dense
over
the
copper
ale
i
liked
the
flavor
and
found
it
meduim
bodied
with
some
caramelized
malt
and
fruity
notes
and
a
solid
hop
presence
throughout
the
aroma
improved
as
it
warmed
to
a
citrusy
marmalade
like
scent
that
minus
the
musty
smell
which
lingered
reminded
me
of
fuller
esb
strong
hop
aftertaste
very
british
and
a
slight
alcohol
warm
i
think
i
caught
this
bottle
just
before
it
went
south
good
to
see
a
reasonably
strong
ale
6
5
from
the
uk
i
recommend
refridgeration
to
stall
fermentation
yipes
sourish
offmilk
flavour
and
quite
yeasty
monstrously
weird
quite
hard
to
drink
ill
give
it
a
miss
if
ever
offered
it
again
definitely
didnt
agree
with
me
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
copper
color
the
head
is
a
decent
light
tan
color
its
fizzyheavy
carboninated
and
has
a
cider
taste
which
gives
it
a
sour
finish
i
have
had
other
bitters
both
here
and
in
london
and
there
are
better
ones
out
there
it
might
be
hurt
due
to
being
in
a
clear
bottle
dark
copper
lots
of
carbonation
which
pours
out
a
nice
frothy
head
with
yeast
sediment
smells
sour
taste
is
extremely
sour
lip
puckering
to
the
point
where
im
about
to
make
faces
with
every
sip
alcohol
evident
adding
to
the
puckering
i
stirred
up
the
yeast
sediment
and
poured
it
out
too
this
is
an
english
bitter
gone
wild
sturdy
caramel
malt
body
english
hop
bittering
adding
teeth
im
trying
to
be
objective
but
this
stuff
is
wicked
not
to
my
taste
sour
mmm
curious
brew
here
huge
carbonation
i
could
barely
pour
this
stuff
without
ending
up
with
four
parts
foam
and
one
part
beer
strange
aroma
too
predominate
musty
smell
with
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
light
copper
color
prickly
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
very
unusual
stuff
i
dont
think
id
go
back
to
this
one
no
shortage
of
carbonation
here
one
of
those
bottle
conditioned
beers
where
you
have
to
belch
after
every
drink
to
make
room
for
the
next
caramel
malt
was
the
forefront
flavor
and
i
didnt
get
much
hops
working
in
this
beer
maybe
this
was
too
understated
for
me
to
appreciate
but
this
beer
didnt
do
much
to
hold
my
interest
notes
a
very
traditional
bottleconditioned
english
ale
as
real
as
it
gets
in
the
bottle
and
you
either
like
these
real
ales
need
some
palate
maturation
or
youll
hate
them
forever
me
i
like
them
theres
nothing
like
beer
thats
alive
and
maturing
in
the
bottle
vanilla
spice
and
a
faint
sherry
note
first
engage
the
nose
and
then
light
hop
aromas
malt
and
slight
caramel
with
a
hint
of
fruit
become
more
apparent
it
pours
brilliant
copper
amber
under
a
fluffy
1
off
white
foam
cap
the
palate
really
highlights
the
oak
in
a
masterful
way
with
vanilla
a
slight
mustiness
that
suggests
a
bourbon
with
considerably
less
alcohol
behind
this
lurks
a
nutty
graham
cracker
fruity
esb
flavors
above
average
carbonation
also
masks
the
esb
qualities
a
little
bit
as
does
a
creamy
texture
the
body
is
just
above
medium
almost
like
a
jazz
riff
on
an
esb
i
am
looking
forward
to
tasting
more
of
their
beers
the
beer
pours
a
nice
white
head
that
borders
between
creamy
and
bubbly
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
copper
that
borders
on
brown
and
is
clear
the
beer
has
very
strong
oak
notes
when
its
cold
but
the
vanilla
beans
really
come
through
and
work
well
with
the
oak
which
gives
a
bit
a
of
a
nice
spicy
note
to
it
the
malts
come
out
but
not
as
strongly
and
give
an
interesting
sweetness
to
the
bouquet
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
notes
but
that
the
oak
is
much
stronger
than
the
vanilla
bean
and
the
malts
are
fairly
sweet
the
notes
combine
to
give
off
a
roasted
coconut
taste
which
is
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
smooth
with
biting
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
one
that
i
will
definitely
pick
up
i
have
heard
some
great
things
about
element
this
is
not
one
o
should
have
never
been
bottled
i
detect
some
spoilage
here
a
fun
little
beer
here
very
flavorful
for
an
esb
lots
of
vanilla
lighter
malts
and
a
toasted
caramel
sweetness
towards
the
finish
that
is
really
nice
its
oaky
in
a
different
way
this
isnt
in
wine
or
bourbon
its
new
oak
that
still
has
a
lot
of
its
pop
to
it
sappy
and
full
of
flavor
thats
earthy
and
sweet
not
tainted
like
some
other
alcoholic
beverage
the
wood
goes
great
with
the
vanilla
sweet
malts
and
the
effervescent
carbonation
makes
it
drink
a
lot
lighter
than
it
is
sweet
flavor
but
does
not
stay
sweet
the
wood
and
english
malt
take
over
in
a
drying
way
a
light
amber
colored
liquid
that
stays
light
even
as
it
warms
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
rather
fairly
priced
for
what
it
is
about
10
bucks
for
a
big
bottle
get
it
if
you
can
overall
pretty
good
stuff
for
a
sweeter
style
ale
like
the
balance
and
complexity
oak
in
your
face
its
a
solid
beer
nice
caramel
backboned
strong
ale
but
as
it
warms
it
is
just
completely
dominated
by
oak
i
love
barrell
aged
beers
but
all
i
taste
is
barrell
needs
to
either
kick
up
the
abv
or
tone
down
the
barrell
it
simply
smells
and
tastes
like
a
platform
for
oak
overall
overall
the
phenolic
character
is
too
overpowering
for
me
however
after
the
initial
taste
of
solventyplastic
is
gone
there
is
a
nice
floral
sweetness
left
behind
the
second
taste
sensation
makes
me
want
more
though
and
i
did
enjoy
the
whole
glass
o
overall
a
nice
strong
ale
aged
in
oak
barrels
it
has
some
vanilla
to
it
from
the
barrels
which
i
liked
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
a
full
bottle
by
myself
but
splitting
it
with
someone
this
winter
would
be
nice
o
a
highly
driknable
brew
that
i
would
gladly
buy
again
o
pretty
much
exactly
as
described
tastes
and
smells
like
an
esb
thats
been
oak
aged
but
without
the
bitterness
nice
clean
crisp
and
balanced
flavors
relative
simplicity
keeps
it
from
scoring
higher
but
its
definitely
a
beer
i
enjoyed
super
malty
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
cheers
overall
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
not
overly
memorable
no
flaws
but
im
not
wowd
either
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
english
strong
ales
just
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
when
i
bought
the
bottle
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
maybe
not
something
id
seek
out
again
flavors
werent
anything
outstanding
and
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
much
o
unique
is
the
best
word
to
describe
this
everything
i
found
in
here
was
subtle
and
well
incorporated
thanks
for
the
treat
b
and
e
sometimes
i
dont
bother
with
writing
about
the
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
huge
part
of
the
beer
the
carbonation
instantly
stings
your
tongue
when
you
drink
this
i
like
variety
so
im
saying
this
is
a
positive
a
very
smooth
and
mellow
beer
with
interesting
and
unique
flavors
i
want
to
like
it
but
i
think
its
a
little
too
loose
on
the
palate
maybe
just
some
bittering
hops
to
tighten
things
up
the
oak
is
somewhat
odd
too
maybe
not
the
right
barrell
or
staves
or
the
right
toast
level
for
this
recipe
worth
a
look
if
you
liked
sam
smith
yorkshire
stingo
overall
the
oak
was
really
heavy
and
made
the
beer
not
enjoyable
for
me
id
like
to
try
the
base
beer
for
comparison
as
it
seems
like
an
interesting
beverage
but
the
oak
dashed
any
hopes
of
that
a
lot
of
barrel
age
beers
ive
tried
taste
more
like
bourbon
than
beer
eos
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
beer
and
the
barrel
o
very
impressive
i
dont
usually
gravitate
towards
esbsesas
but
the
oak
ageing
and
this
brewerys
track
record
with
me
made
me
really
glad
that
jax
sent
this
along
overall
this
is
a
very
good
well
put
together
brew
element
brews
cost
a
bit
more
than
some
but
they
are
definitely
worth
it
if
you
end
up
digging
the
overall
buds
offering
youll
also
find
it
somewhat
mediumfull
bodied
yet
somewhat
light
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
thought
it
was
alright
better
maybe
minus
the
above
id
try
it
again
wo
wood
d
drinkability
is
high
incredibly
easy
to
put
this
down
and
the
flavors
keep
enticing
me
back
for
more
the
alcohol
is
nonexistent
and
overall
just
a
finely
crafted
beer
not
too
shy
to
show
off
its
presentation
of
epic
lacing
and
pale
amber
sheen
oak
fruit
yeast
tone
doughy
biscuit
and
lemony
hops
are
a
great
showing
for
an
aroma
heavy
silky
smoothness
the
malt
and
oak
character
intertwine
so
much
and
so
deeply
that
they
play
off
each
other
and
compliment
each
other
subtle
hopping
evens
out
the
fruitiness
that
bounces
around
leafy
a
drier
side
shows
more
toward
the
finish
with
oaky
overtones
and
a
lingering
fruitiness
yeah
the
alcohol
warms
but
its
very
delicate
a
brush
of
greatness
they
have
created
on
this
canvas
you
have
to
take
this
one
a
little
slowly
and
it
seems
better
paired
with
a
cold
winter
day
or
after
dinner
but
very
nice
purchased
a
bottle
for
9
99
at
wine
nation
in
millbury
at
the
blackstone
shoppes
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
dark
orange
color
bordering
on
shades
of
burnt
auburn
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
a
nice
sized
head
that
surprisingly
lasts
for
quite
a
long
time
smell
has
a
subtle
hint
of
wood
and
bourbon
to
its
credit
taste
was
very
pleasant
it
had
a
mellow
bit
of
oak
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
but
that
would
fit
well
with
the
style
of
an
esb
drinkability
was
in
the
high
range
as
this
beer
was
very
smooth
and
tasty
the
eso
was
my
first
taste
of
element
brewing
and
if
i
can
find
more
i
would
certainly
be
willing
to
try
another
from
this
brewery
d
pretty
drinkable
overall
pretty
light
nothing
is
repugnant
about
it
taste
starts
with
clean
malt
character
then
find
the
off
part
of
the
nose
again
in
the
middle
then
closes
with
a
floral
bitterness
dry
bitterness
clings
to
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
over
the
tongue
but
drinkability
is
limited
for
me
by
the
flavor
and
aroma
not
quite
liking
this
one
as
much
as
their
other
offerings
which
i
have
enjoyed
f
mostly
dry
with
a
touch
of
lingering
sweetness
some
minerality
slight
bitterness
creamy
flavors
are
there
too
as
its
just
starting
to
get
the
nitro
feel
a
little
chocolate
again
with
a
lot
more
wood
esthers
oak
and
whisky
late
on
the
finish
coming
on
stronger
as
it
warms
theres
also
a
little
weird
bitterness
that
wont
go
away
either
indistinguishable
from
the
classic
english
esb
except
for
possibly
a
higher
alcohol
level
thats
nearly
imperceptible
but
i
wonder
d
for
me
just
an
average
brew
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
overall
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
beer
more
like
whiskey
with
beer
consistency
sans
the
alcohol
kick
wow
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
oak
aromas
without
any
hops
in
the
nose
creamy
texture
with
a
oak
like
never
before
finish
i
cant
tell
is
is
a
wine
port
whiskey
barrel
some
vanilla
spice
tannin
has
a
alcohol
wallop
that
you
will
not
see
coming
i
had
2
of
these
at
the
bar
and
i
was
done
there
is
no
booze
or
heat
like
you
would
expect
from
such
a
potent
beer
very
well
done
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
breaking
this
one
out
poured
with
the
appearance
of
sweet
tea
no
head
just
a
skim
and
a
frothy
band
around
the
shoulders
of
the
glass
nose
was
somewhat
subdued
light
fruity
esters
and
a
little
malt
taste
consistent
with
nose
a
little
oak
with
some
buttery
diacetyl
and
a
slightly
grainy
character
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
smooth
even
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
brew
not
sure
how
style
consistent
it
is
but
definitely
solid
interesting
and
consistent
with
the
brewers

very

to

on
this

was
lightly

but
was
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
drinkability
old
school
bliss
another
decent
but
brew
that
i
wont
remember
i
could
see
some
people
loving
the
english
balance
and
raving
about
this
one
but
its
a
one
and
done
for
this
guy
overall
this
strong
ale
is
almost
borderline
with
an
english
barleywine
fruity
malty
and
delicious
o
i
enjoyed
the
complexities
in
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
it
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
pleasant
enough
to
sip
a
decent
tipple
in
the
way
of
the
main
islands
strong
ales
fo
sho
with
the
same
uk
malt
and
hop
sensibilities
that
this
brewer
may
not
be
altogether
comfortable
with
admitting
maybe
not
my
favorite
vis
a
vis
the
same
concept
so
prevalent
here
on
our
shores
but
the
name
is
cool
and
i
would
imagine
if
i
were
in
dublin
town
center
this
would
be
a
stellar
alternative
to
well
anything
ointeresting
ale
flavors
are
decent
but
balance
is
off
doesnt
live
up
to
first
impressions
looks
good
and
smells
promising
more
boozy
than
flavorful
and
fairly
weak
body
overall
its
a
very
hoppy
and
dry
old
ale
unfortunately
i
like
my
old
ales
less
dry
and
sweet
so
i
will
not
be
getting
this
again

the
caps
on
this
brewerys
bottles
always
strike
me
as
funny
lots
of
caramel
and
malts
on
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
it
could
work
if
it
were
more
balanced
but
unfortunately
it
is
not
too
much
sweetness
and
its
cloying
really
this
is
by
far
my
least
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
the
others
i
tried
of
theirs
were
much
better
poured
into
a
macandrews
thistle
glass
pours
a
dark
coppery
red
amber
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
dark
and
light
fruit
flavor
begins
with
caramel
and
bready
malt
light
and
dark
dried
fruit
developing
a
more
nutty
malt
flavor
and
finishing
with
dark
fruit
hints
of
wood
and
hops
a
great
malty
body
and
interesting
flavor
progression
flavors
become
more
muted
as
the
glass
warms
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
some
barley
wine
elements
but
fits
as
an
english
strong
ale
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
ale
m
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
reddish
brown
color
the
head
was
a
cream
color
and
had
a
pretty
good
retention
to
it
the
lacing
wasnt
bad
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
bigger
hop
profile
than
i
expected
the
amount
of
malt
used
was
in
there
also
to
give
this
beer
a
really
nice
aroma
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
with
the
toasted
malts
as
well
as
the
lively
hops
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
really
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
worth
trying
it
was
actually
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
m
light
to
medium
bodied
great
carbonation
helps
wash
away
any
chance
of
it
being
too
boozy
not
bad
a
little
quirky
without
being
terribly
memorable

i
had
a

detailed
review
written
on
this
beer
lets
go
with
a

nut
colored
ale
with
a
light

head
forming
thick
bands
of
even
lacing
aroma
has
pine
herbal
citrus
fruitiness
that
blends
well
with
the
inviting
caramel
malts
and
slightly
sour
notes
i
explained
the
intricacies
that
the
use
in
the
hops
in
the
nose
dont
transcend
into
to
the
hop
flavor
a
strong
harsh
hop
bitterness
was
welcomed
with
each
sip
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
cohesion
like
i
did
in
the
nose
the
finish
is
green
bitter
dryness
mouthfeel
is
ilght
to
medium
bodied
with
a
harsh
level
of
carbonation
my
main
two
issues
with
the
beer
were
the
carbonation
and
the
temperature
i
served
it
at
on
cask
this
would
be
sublime
i
think
its
time
to
visit
ireland
god
bless
all
those
proud
irish
out
there
because
this
beer
is
labeled
100
irish
brewed
in
dublin
of
course
o
the
abv
on
this
beer
is
not
terribly
high
but
you
can
definitely
feel
it
warm
the
soul
a
bit
the
complexity
is
welcoming
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
especially
as
it
warms
good
job
for
the
style
my
favorite
of
all
the
ales
offered
at
the
porterhouse
o
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
not
horrible
but
porterhouse
has
done
better
work
in
the
past
o
very
decent
beer
one
to
return
to
again
and
again
o
overall
not
a
bad
or
offensive
beer
but
just
kind
of
there
not
much
going
on
in
either
the
nose
or
the
taste
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
can
you
bottle
boring
apparently
beer
is
too
thin
watery
nearly
no
flavor
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
its
like
water
big
disappointment
here
which
is
odd
because
i
didnt
have
expectations
it
doesnt
taste
bad
i
guess
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
anything
d
just
goes
to
prove
that
appearances
can
be
deceiving
what
a
let
down
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
beer
to
tell
you
it
is
a
7
ale
no
alcoholic
warmth
too
thin
bodied
and
nothing
on
the
palate
woefully
bland
a
poor
performer
all
round
d
really
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
oily
mouthfeel
and
a
sweet
finish
a
great
aperitif
to
one
of
the
many
excellent
meals
available
at
the
porterhouse
d
warming
absolutely
scumptious
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
definitely
recommended
will
drink
again
in
fact
ill
follow
this
with
a
pint
of
the
stuff
porterhouses
best
beer
dr
if
not
for
the
price
id
order
this
left
and
right
if
youre
at
the
porterhouse
this
is
the
only
beer
they
brew
themselves
thats
worth
ordering
d
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
it
probably
could
be
with
more
age
there
is
a
nice
malt
character
in
the
aroma
but
the
hops
dominate
the
flavor
profile
it
has
a
level
and
harshness
of
bitterness
that
is
surprisingly
reminiscent
of
an
american
barleywine
this
beer
tastes
a
bit
young
to
me
and
i
imagine
that
it
would
mellow
and
grow
more
complex
with
six
months
to
a
year
of
age
d
while
this
is
one
of
their
heavier
beers
it
goes
down
easily
enough
and
if
youve
already
had
a
meal
at
the
pub
you
can
still
continue
the
evening
the
body
is
moderate
but
the
sweetness
gives
it
a
perception
that
its
bigger
than
it
really
is
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
of
a
deterrent
some
slickness
as
well
which
really
hints
at
the
diacetyl
overall
some
nice
complexity
but
some
major
flaws
really
hold
this
beer
back
clean
those
out
and
now
were
talkin
overall
the
beer
felt
very
hoppy
and
bittery
harsh
sometimes
but
what
i
liked
was
that
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
quite
drinkable
i
do
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
ontap
irish
beers
that
i
have
had
here
in
ireland
but
i
cant
drink
too
much
of
it
though
because
of
the
7
abv
im
glad
that
its
so
close
as
im
going
to
be
sure
to
have
more
of
it
a
little
unbalanced
and
unrefined
slightly
harsh
also
but
solid
none
the
less
m
overall
its
a
fullbodied
and
fullflavoured
albeit
overly
onedimensional
strong
ale
yet
the
soft
mouthfeel
proves
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
me
having
said
that
its
still
enjoyable
better
enjoyed
as
a
digestif
woke
up
the
next
morning
with
little
memory
of
the
night
before
definetly
a
brain
blaster
medium
body
sweet
aftertaste
with
vanilla
and
bitter
and
toasted
too
tastysmooth
hoppy
firm
very
nice
drop
actually
disguises
the
7
alc
well
some
sweet
lightly
caramelly
hops
and
bitterish
citric
hops
i
found
it
a
bit
sticky
at
times
but
generally
pretty
soft
in
texture
and
as
i
said
before
it
disguises
the
alcohol
quite
well
pretty
tasty
o
i
d
like
this
one
a
whole
lot
more
if
it
werent
so
freakin
sweet
not
bad
but
definitely
a
one
and
done
share
with
others
so
you
wont
have
to
drink
it
all
yourself
o
just
okay
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
which
is
disappointing
o
officially
labeled
an
english
strong
ale
this
one
has
a
lot
in
common
with
a
scotch
ale
or
a
barley
wine
a
very
nice
ale
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
after
a
big
meal
with
a
fire
burning
in
the
fireplace
o
super
drinkable
and
the
heat
really
accentuated
the
beer
and
was
pleasant
very
nice
sipper
notes
super
yummy
tasty
hope
to
buy
again
odd
beer
doesnt
really
work
for
this
palate
with
somewhat
harsh
spicy
flavours
dark
brown
with
som
ruby
highlights
near
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
lots
of
sediment
which
was
hard
to
avoid
pouring
dark
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
caramel
notes
as
well
as
raisin
and
licorice
undertones
and
a
whiff
of
ethanol
the
flavor
is
malty
featuring
more
roasted
malts
adding
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
caramel
little
to
no
hop
presence
medium
body
bordering
on
being
slightly
thin
or
watery
overall
drinkability
i
wonder
if
this
would
best
on
cask
rather
than
in
a
bottle
its
tasty
smells
interesting
and
overall
i
could
see
myself
having
another
one
a
full
pint
no
less
o
so
complex
yet
very
drinkable
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
at
daleside
pleasantly
surpised
by
this
beer
maybe
not
as
good
as
stingo
or
gearys
but
definately
worth
a
try
d
certainly
a
drinkable
brew
but
definitely
unique
in
that
i
didnt
think
a
lighter
alcohol
version
of
an
ale
existed
which
had
the
same
characteristics
as
usually
much
darker
stoutsporters
the
body
was
pleasantly
full
without
being
heavy
or
filling
drinkability
was
very
nice
smooth
and
easy
overall
a
nice
easy
brew
thats
worth
your
time
quite
a
lot
of
body
on
it
but
it
does
feel
a
bit
thin
right
at
the
back
and
incredibly
drying
it
feels
like
a
big
hangoverinducing
beer
d
i
dont
understand
this
beer
it
has
a
ton
of
flavors
but
theyre
not
necessarily
the
best
im
pretty
bored
of
it
already
and
dont
anticipate
having
it
again
its
flavor
combination
is
remarkable
but
nonetheless
offputting
given
the
amount
of
soy
sauce
and
ginger
i
can
only
imagine
how
this
beer
would
taste
with
sushi
i
wouldnt
classify
this
as
an
english
strong
ale
not
at
5
5
abv
and
with
no
real
strong
alcohol
presence
i
didnt
take
notes
why
sampling
the
beer
last
night
but
two
words
pretty
much
define
the
beer
the
first
is
ginger
and
the
other
is
caramel
malts
put
the
two
together
with
some
modest
carbonation
some
complex
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
leafy
hop
in
the
finish
and
this
is
the
beer
in
a
nutshell
it
is
a
nice
complex
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
rereview
in
order
to
write
a
fuller
more
comprehensive
review
at
a
later
time
the
aroma
is
sweet
its
got
toasted
malt
cola
soya1
sauce
spicesherbs
ginger
and
fruit
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
the
aroma
but
has
a
papery
finish
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
quite
interesting
but
not
great
quite
drinkable
though
unusual
tasted
on

mouthfeel
very
light
carbonation

to
drink
pour
a
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
light
brown
head
that
settled
into
a
thick
cap
the
aroma
is
of
buttery
malt
minerals
raisins
and
spice
the
taste
is
of
rusty
water
very
slight
chocolate
raisins
pine
and
allspice
the
look
and
aroma
scream
malty
but
the
tastes
fails
to
deliver
though
there
is
a
nice
spice
kick
the
feel
is
light
and
watery
well
carbonated
and
finishes
with
a
slight
malt
bitterness
an
average
english
ale
that
looks
and
smells
great
but
disappoints
some
in
the
flavor
i
was
expecting
a
more
robust
malt
flavor
d
super
easy
drinking
i
would
kill
for
this
on
cask
that
would
be
mind
blowing
until
then
just
good
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
m
d
goes

i
would
love
to
try
this
on

oelergud
drank
it
a
couple
times
too
chilled
and
the
medicinal
notes
seemed
to
overpower
the
other
spices
when
drank
at
a
nicer
temp
very
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
pours
chestnut
brown
with

down
the

some
notes
of

dark

flavor
has
some

notes
although
mild
along
with
more
molasses
and
faint
dark
malt
and
raisins
mouthfeel
is
low
finish
is
very
slightly
cloying
another
enjoyable
offering
from
daleside
drinks
alright
but
unless
i
was
eating
christmas
cookies
all
day
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
2
at
a
session
this
all
rounded
to
a
smooth
long
and
somewhat
warming
finish
a
darn
good
beer
a
reddish
brown
beer
with
a
big
malty
nose
this
is
a
spicy
brew
with
a
real
ginger
note
to
the
finish
the
drinkability
is
high
in
part
to
the
smoothness
and
the
nice
blend
of
all
the
parts
not
an
every
day
beer
but
rather
a
treat
that
stands
apart
from
the
usual
english
ales
drinkability
very
interesting
and
worth
a
try
not
so
crazy
about
it
however
at
5
5
this
is
a
strong
ale
regardless
its
an
interesting
beer
basically
it
tastes
like
a
very
mild
english
dark
ale
or
almost
porter
with
an
overwhelming
gruit
flavor
cool
and
interesting
beer
overall
a
nice
tasty
beer
d
alright
this
beer
is
heavily
spiced
and
it
has
a
dominant
ginger
presence
not
worth
seeking
out
but
worth
a
try
if
you
stumble
across
it
it
flavor
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
typical
bland
english
ale
with
some
heavy
ginger
extract
added
maybe
brewed
with
some
molasses
in
the
malt
didnt
care
for
it
at
first
because
i
really
wasnt
expecting
something
flavored
like
this
and
i
didnt
think
it
was
too
great
until
it
warmed
up
a
bit
i
highly
recommend
letting
this
one
sit
out
of
the
fridge
for
30
minutes
it
gets
much
much
better
more
so
than
most
beers
and
becomes
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
kind
of
a
jekyll
and
hyde
brew
give
it
a
chance
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
these
with
the
low
abv
but
i
think
i
would
normally
choose
something
else
while
i
love
cardamon
coffee
and
curries
and
while
i
enjoyed
its
role
in
this
beer
i
feel
its
bitterness
affects
this
brews
sessionability
that
being
said
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
and
something
that
anyone
who
enjoys
cardamon
should
visit
from
time
to
time
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
hope
to
drink
it
again
sometime
if
nothing
else
this
is
one
very
unique
ale
a
real
spicefest
many
thanks
to
rudge75
and
fisherman34
for
sending
this
out
via
canbif

recommended
and
get
some
aged
cheddar
to
partner
this
one
notes
impressive
although
its
not
one
ill
go
back
to
the
well
for
too
often
poured
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
good
light
brown
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
with
excellent
lacing
flavors
were
of
ginger
roasted
malt
and
caramel
nutty
accents
with
a
medium
body
and
a
smooth
texture
a
little
unusual
at
the
first
taste
but
began
to
like
it
more
as
i
went
along
typical
english
stuff
but
with
some
twists
quite
dark
looking
with
a
nearly
opaque
ruby
hue
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
very
sweet
with
dark
toffee
caramel
malts
and
added
sweetness
tastes
very
sweet
nearly
worty
flavors
carry
a
strong
toffee
and
cola
flavor
that
i
found
odd
kinda
like
mr
pibbs
very
toasty
and
confectionate
sweet
the
feel
is
nearly
thick
and
cloying
with
a
light
alcohol
heat
and
spiciness
that
cut
through
the
malts
the
finish
reveals
a
gingerlike
hot
flavor
and
feel
piney
hops
and
sweet
berries
strange
that
these
flavors
show
up
only
so
late

of

deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
strange
spices
with
some
roasted
malt
taste
is
best
described
as
a
spiced
english

warmer
with
a
medium
bitter
finish
i
honestly
have
a
hard
time
identifying
the
mix
of
spices
included
here
but
would
say
that
it
was
quite
enjoyable
body
is
about
average
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
interesting
beer
is
doesnt
even
start
to
describe
this
the
color
was
dark
red
but
deeper
than
the
amber
browns
you
may
be
used
to
in
short
this
beer
is
for
those
who
are
tired
of
the
ordinary
interpretations
of
common
styles
very
original
but
maybe
not
for
everyone
i
will
purchase
it
again
morocco
ale
is
an
impressively
distinctive
beer
and
is
unlike
anything
that
ive
ever
had
its
easily
my
favorite
of
the
daleside
offerings
and
is
a
beer
that
id
love
to
drink
again
if
i
could
only
remember
where
i
bought
it
if
you
enjoy
spiced
ales
this
one
definitely
deserves
a
purchase
luck
to
levins
whilst
tkent
flows
taste
has
a
lot
of
the

characteristics
that
the
nose
suggests
lots
of
spice
and
packed
with
dark
roasted

caramelmolasses
sweetness
that
isnt
cloying
and
a
mild
earthy
hop
presence
the
ginger
is
very
evident
on
the
palate
and
in
the
dry
spicy
finish
mouthfeel
isnt
overcarbonated
but
feels
a
bit
thin
like
i
find
a
lot
of
british
beers
tend
to
regardless
a
hefty
spiced
stout
with
lots
of
flavour
and
drinkable
but
this
might
get
a
bit
much
after
a
couple
pints
dark
brown
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
ginger
soya
carrot
and
earthy
hops
more
ginger
in
the
mouth
along
with
notes
of
chocolate
coriander
roasted
malt
caramel
and
teriyaki
sauce
a
bit
too
overcarbonated
and
light
bodied
for
the
style
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
asian
salad
dressing
that
my
wife
makes
a
somewhat
bizzare
beer
but
still
pretty
good
pours
a

acton
ma
md
full
of
body
yet
soft
on
the
palate
whilst
the
freshness
from
carbonation
is
retained
just
beautifully
the
spicy
content
mingles
smoothly
with
a
potent
malty
body
making
it
a
spicy
yet
firm
dark
ale
unlike
some
other
spicy
ales
which
sadly
lose
the
foundation
an
unusual
and
quite
delicious
ale
well
worth
a
try
supple
on
the
tongue
and
easily
sent
down
the
gullet
for
those
who
enjoy
the
flavor
of
ginger
if
youre
not
one
of
those
stay
clear
away
and
shut
your
wallet
the
predominant
flavor
is
an
assertive
caramelcandy
malt
and
on
first
pass
the
beer
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
after
a
few
more
sips
however
the
judicious
spice
flavors
emerge
slightly
herbal
and
the
overall
impression
is
a
winter
warmer
as
the
beer
temperature
came
up
a
bit
more
complexity
developed
in
the
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
came
through
evolving
into
almost
porterlike
beer
quite
the
chameleon
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
strong
herbal
aroma
its
quite
refreshing
but
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
aroma
i
guess
its
ginger
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
herbal
flavor
that
is
slow
going
down
and
spicey
on
the
finish
it
has
a
ginger
beer
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
beer
with
good
aroma
im
just
not
sold
on
the
taste
coppery
red
and
clear
appearance
with
a
big
foamy
orangish
head
sticky
and
complex
lace
patterns
nice
aroma
interesting
if
slightly
phenolic
has
some
qualities
like
horehound
cough
drops
ginger
and
peppermint
light
mouthfeel
low
but
persistent
carbonation
i
have
to
say
i
dig
the
taste
of
this
beer
just
because
it
has
distinctive
qualities
prickly
pine
cone
star
anise
and
spicy
molasses
flavors
mix
in
to
give
a
restrained
perfumelike
impression
yeah
even
like
a
disinfected
shower
room
on
warming
it
even
reminds
me
of
stove
top
stuffing
mix
works
well
for
me
combining
with
the
easygoing
mouthfeel
to
give
a
nice
drinkability
when
youre
in
the
mood
drinkability
the
spices
overpower
the
ale
try
it
as
a
novelty
and
nothing
else
500
ml

medium
light
in
body
with
steady
carbonation
if
there
is
historical
accuracy
to
the
bottles
claim
this
can
readily
be
seen
as
precusor
to
many
a
modern
day
spiced
winter
warmers
a
la
anchor
our
special
ale
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
a
thin
wispy
head
leaving
no
lace
behindbig
orange
aroma
with
a
little
ginger
in
there
that
was
really
appetizing
ginger
to
the
hilt
flavor
wise
it
gets
overpowering
after
awhile
to
go
along
with
a
menthol
quality
to
make
this
brew
pretty
odd
in
the
flavor
department
and
a
little
much
to
handle
if
you
wanna
try
something
different
this
is
it
i
wont
revisit
it
but
glad
to
give
it
a
try
good
enough
as
a
spiced
ale
sure
as
hell
not
a
belgian
pale
ale
first
of
all
as
a
lover
of
belgian
ales
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
definitly
not
a
belgian
pale
ale
what
it
is
perhaps
best
described
as
is
simply
a
spiced
ale
it
is
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
it
is
one
well
worth
trying
the
beer
pours
nicely
but
is
let
down
by
the
fact
that
the
ginger
aroma
is
almost
all
empowering
leaving
no
room
for
hop
or
other
spice
aromas
to
shine
through
the
taste
is
fine
although
once
again
the
ginger
is
perhaps
a
little
dominant
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
little
watery
for
a
beer
of
such
strong
flavour
i
would
recomend
drinking
this
beer
alongside
some
heavily
spiced
red
meats
perhaps
mediteranian
style
kind
of
tasted
too
much
like
ginger
ale
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
else
just
ginger
a
bit
of
malt
and
i
really
couldnt
detect
much
hops
this
didnt
do
much
for
me
there
wasnt
much
happening
aside
from
the
ginger
flavour
quite
unpleasant
and
quite
hard
to
drink
in
the
end
not
impressed
aroma
of
ginger
and
the
taste
of
licorice
makes
for
an
interesting
combination
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
2
00
however
it
didnt
leave
me
wanting
another
isnt
that
the
sign
of
a
good
beer
you
cant
wait
to
crack
open
the
next
one
this
isnt
that
im
just
trying
to
decide
who
to
pawn
my
other
one
off
to
i
think
the
prevailing
sourness
in
the
mouth
the
the
loss
of
head
after
a
few
seconds
diminished
the
beers
complexity
also
i
have
no
idea
how
long
it
was
shelved
before
finding
its
way
to
the
discount
rack
perhaps
fresher
ones
are
a
completely
different
story
notes
interesting
and
flavorful
but
not
all
that
enjoyable
the
beer
seems
a
little
dirty
to
me
overall
it
is
a
good
english
amber
but
you
need
food
thought
a
word
i
rarely
use
in
beer
terms
smooth
finish
and
a
polished
well
produced
beer
drinkability
is
good
decent
beer
overall
that
drinks
easily
drinkability
a
very
graceful
wellbalanced
tasty
beverage
i
dug
it
maybe
you
will
too
conclusion
if
i
was
a
betting
man
id
say
this
has
probably
been
sitting
around
for
quite
some
time
nevertheless
i
can
only
rate
it
as
im
tasting
it
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
its
just
a
rather
boring
ale
in
that
nothing
stands
out
and
the
fruitiness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
the
aroma
is
nice
its
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
flowers
and
fruit
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
acidic
and
papery
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
nothing
special
i
would
probably
pass
if
offered
another
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
tan
head
the
nose
promises
plenty
of
big
malts
to
come
along
with
citrusy
hops
love
the
taste
semisweet
malts
that
are
almost
spicy
with
a
light
hoppiness
that
keeps
the
attention
on
the
toasty
and
biscuity
qualities
of
the
malts
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
as
a
session
ale
well
worth
the
3
50
i
paid
for
the
bottle
tasted
on
72708
500ml
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
translucent
lighter
amber
body
with
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
malty
with
a
strong
herbal
hop
presence
tastes
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
nut
and
roast
playing
parts
with
a
good
portion
of
herbal
english
hops
especially
in
the
finish
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
light
on
the
palate
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
tasty
and
refreshing
subtle
flavors
and
qualities
contributing
their
part
in
perfect
portion
everything
id
expect
from
a
wellcrafted
english
ale
at
5
per
bottle
this
would
not
be
an
everyday
treat
for
me
nonetheless
its
by
far
the
finest
english
beer
ive
had
in
some
time
and
i
find
nothing
wrong
with
it
drinkability
a
decent
enough
english
strong
but
there
are
other
examples
of
the
style
i
would
prefer
too
much
mineral
content
and
diacetyl
for
my
tastebuds
rereview
june
2009
the
beer
is
thin
a
bit
tart
from
some
leafy
hop
notes
a
tad
lemony
a
little
sourish
and
all
of
the
above
are
true
but
the
beer
deserves
better
than
a
c
im
going
to
up
the
taste
and
nose
of
the
beer
which
has
a
touch
of
diacetyl
and
toffee
notes
the
beer
is
just
okay
but
im
a
little
more
generous
after
trying
it
again
the
beer
poured
a
rich
gold
or
light
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
it
had
a
rich
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
of
malt
with
a
good
hop
finish
the
feel
was
light
and
dry
a
solid
ale
but
not
very
complex
the
hopping
was
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
not
much
floral
to
it
decent
but
not
one
id
search
out
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
second
beer
from
this
brewery
and
both
have
been
truly
enjoyable
interesting
clear
light
amber
in
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
if
any
lacing
smells
of
faint
hops
with
more
fruity
malty
undertones
coming
up
than
anything
clean
thirst
quenching
taste
that
is
pretty
darn
good
in
my
book
some
english
hops
are
evident
and
wellbalanced
by
a
sweet
malty
finish
somewhat
thinner
mouthfeel
though
it
was
very
smooth
and
silky
considering
id
say
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
even
though
its
on
the
high
abv
end
for
its
style
drinks
much
easier
than
youd
think
daleside
seems
to
make
some
quality
stuff
and
this
one
is
no
exception
standard
english
pale
ale
a
nice
caramel
earthy
grassy
aroma
up
front
with
fruitiness
and
sweetness
a
nearly
clear
golden
color
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
smells
malty
and
fruity
oranges
and
apricots
with
a
light
hop
spicy
flavor
and
good
bitter
balance
a
bit
heavy
and
oily
to
the
mouth
keeps
it
from
being
as
refreshing
as
it
should
be
but
a
good
feel
otherwise
finishes
with
empahasis
on
the
fruity
sweetness
and
hop
spiciness
as
with
most
of
these
particular
imports
the
price

a
500ml
bottle
is
to
steep
for
repeated
purchases
just
keep
that
in
mind
but
try
indeed
ripon
is
far
from
a
ripoff
even
though
the
bottle
cost
3
99
its
a
bit
too
tame
to
be
a
regular
purchase
but
im
enjoying
it
nevertheless
ive
now
had
two
daleside
brewery
beers
and
id
have
to
say
that
ripon
jewel
has
a
leg
up
on
old
leg
over
for
the
top
spot
more
to
come
pours
a
one

white
head
that
quickly
goes
leaving
a
trace
of

clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied

hay
starts
nicely
balanced
between
the

is

no

a

thats
plenty
drinkable
but
not
very
distinct
one
you
wish
you
could
have
on
cask
as
with
other
daleside
beers
the

are
a
little

of

the

with
a

i
disagree
with
the
labels
claim
of
full
body
its
rather
light
bodied
perhaps
even
thin
doesnt
quit
live
up
to
the
heritageecological
inspired
marketing
that
said
its
still
a
decent
ale
the
carbonation
is
medium
strong
with
soft
medium
sized
bubbles
which
is
perfect
for
an
pale
ale
body
just
shy
of
medium
with
a
smooth

carbonated
mouthfeel
500

an

that
seems
ohsosimple
at

if
it
werent
for
the
higher
alcohol
content
of

id
suggest
that
this
was
a
brilliant
session
ale
of
the
highest
order
but
it
does
remain
remarkably
drinkable
quite
nice
and
wellworth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
british
ales
a
pretty
decent
esb
all
told

with
an

is

the

through
plenty
of
sweetish
malts
present
a
buttery

backbone
with
some
apple
and
pear
skin
fruitiness
in
the
middle
finishes
dry
and
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
floral

aftertaste
very
nicely
constructed
and
more
in
the
style
of
a
good
english
bitter
or
esb
than
a
pale
ale
i
really
like
this
daleside
offering
better
than
the
old
leg
over
has
more
pizzaz
i
guess
u
could
say
pours
a
dark

with

thin

a
light
amount
of
lacearomas
of
brown
sugar
and
sweet
biscuit
dough
with
a
light
minty
note
letting
u
know
there
is
some
hops
there
a
very
nice
well
rounded
little
ale
here
strarts
out
sweet
and
cakey
but
there
is
nice
herbal
finish
that
really
saves
this
beer
a
bigger
brew
at
5
8
but
i
like
it
alot
i
will
get
more
of
this
one
clear
bottle
amber
with
a
tinge
of
red
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
with
some
floral
citrusy
hops
flavour
is
bitterishsweet
quite
cloying
sweet
at
the
start
but
the
hops
dry
it
out
towards
the
end
and
add
a
touch
of
bitterness
nothing
spectacular
and
not
even
that
interesting
a
bit
medicinal
and
cloying
at
times
taste
wise
it
was
again
malty
and
fruity
a
drier
hop
bitterness
comes
late
on
the
palate
but
this
is
a
primary
a
malty
brew
body
depth
is
good
and
the
alcohol
sits
well
within
the
whole
feel
took
a
flyer
on
this
single
pint
while
buying
other
things
and
went
back
within
a
week
to
get
several
more
as
they
went
down
great
at
a
summer
pig
roast
right
from
the
bottle
love
a
good
hearty
english
brew
especially
the
darker
stuff
where
i
feel
the
english
stuff
really
shines
recommended
a
classic
english
ale
with
lots
of
big
maltiness
and
great
esters
the
light
hop
character
adds
a
nice
dry
finish
very
good
not
a
bad
beer
could
have
been
a
little
denser
i
also
prefer
my
strong
ales
to
be
stronger
in
the
abv
a
nice
beer
and
a
slightly
more
elaborate
one
than
you
often
get
from
a
british
brewery
while
i
appreciate
a
really
good
mild
english
ale
every
now
and
then
id
prefer
one
like
this
with
just
that
little
bit
more
oomph
ive
never
seen
this
beer
on
shelves
in
toledo
so
i
was
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
at
the
one
2
lounge
in
sylvania
friday
night
it
feels
good
to
get
away
from
the
hops
after
a
pint
of
monkey
wrench
imagine
what
the
high
definition
version
cask
would
yield
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
of
foam
as
you
take
in
the
scents
of
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
drinks
much
like
a
stout
as
it
has
that
thicker
and
heavier
taste
to
it
nicely
made
and
finishes
rather
smoothly
something
to
try
if
you
like
heavier
beers
great
lacing
on
this
mahogany
colored
beer
the
aroma
is
a
soft
mix
of
malt
baking
bread
yeast
and
earth
nice
flavor
fairly
dry
with
a
mineralwater
and
carbonic
feel
plenty
of
malt
in
the
taste
as
well
touch
of
butterscotch
the
longlasting
maltcentric
finish
quite
nice
overall
the
taste
had
a
couple
issues
but
overall
it
was
quite
nice
it
looked
felt
and
drank
wonderfully
decent
beer
poured
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
settled
down
and
no
lace
color
is
a
lovely
clear
medium
red
amber
aroma
is
very
malty
roast
toffee
and
a
hint
fruity
flavor
is
like
aroma
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
medium
in
length
serviceable
beer
if
you
were
in
the
mood
for
a
straightforward
malty
ale
this
could
be
a
session
a
quite
light
body
with
a
low
soft
carboantion
make
sfor
an
easy
drink
drinkability
average
but
accessible
though
one
ill
have
to
pass
i
enjoyed
the
monkey
shenanigans
story
on
the
label
more
than
anything
else
f
finishes
a
little
drier
at
least
actually
pretty
dry
surprisingly
for
how
sweet
it
started
its
also
a
little
bitter
on
the
finish
probably
english
style
bittering
hops
the
raisinfig
fruit
seems
to
linger
a
bit
as
well
it
also
seems
to
add
an
interesting
slightly
salty
taste
at
the
end
pretty
smooth
and
light
a
good
session
beer
not
bad
at
all
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
and
on
cask
still
worth
a
try
as
is
but
i
can
see
this
being
great
under
different
conditions
d
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
the
taste
makes
up
for
what
it
lacks
in
body
and
smell
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
cool
rainy
night
just
the
right
mix
of
hops
and
malt
a
great
beer
very
wellbalanced
veritable
hops
without
any
astringency
peculiar
sourness
in
aroma
but
by
no
means
a
negative
perfect
mouthfeel
full
malty
body
endanger
of
being
too
sweet
but
this
is
offset
by
a
reasonable
amount
of
hops
d
a
nice
beer
that
goes
down
smoothly
not
the
best
beer
from
u
k
but
surely
a
very
nice
one
champion
winter
beer
of
great
britain
competition
class
winner
maybe
better
fresh
this
one
seemed
slightly
bland
stuck
between
an
english
dark
mild
and
an
english
strong
ale
or
maybe
an
english
brown
ale
still
somewhat
sessionable
and
enjoyable
and
im
sure
to
win
someone
over
d
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
but
i
dont
think
it
will
become
a
new
favorite
im
impressed
and
glad
to
have
picked
up
this
bottle
for
a
sample
bottle
from
capital
marketsalem
a
pleasant
english
strong
ale
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
whole
lot
of
distinctive
or
memorable
characteristics
i
suspect
its
a
different
experience
from
the
cask
as
im
sure
it
was
originally
intended
smooth
light
effervescence
almost
creamy

heavy
on
the
malt
flavors
with
just
enough
hops
to
even
it
out
there
are
dark
specialty
malts
all
over
the
flavor
giving
it
a
complex
malt
profile
that
develops
as
it
warms
good
smooth
mouthfeel
due
to
low
carbonation
easy
to
quaff
good
stuff

a
mild

that
goes

i
would
like
to
session
this
in
an
english
pub
one
day
a
nice
and
surprisingly
drinkable

with
nearly
an
inch

roasty
with
hints
of

the
aroma
is
not

apparent
tastes
roasty
malty
nutty
with
just
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
present
toward
the
finish
tastes
are
fairly
subtle
but
are
all
very
pleasant
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
but
not
too
much
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
at
5
per
bottle
its
a
little
pricier
than
something
id
drink
on
a
daily
basis
but
its
a
smooth
easydrinking
solid
english
beer
that
i
may
pick
up
from
time
to
time
di
like
the
flavors
and
i
thoroughly
enjoy
drinking
this
but
the
body
and
the
weak
pour
kind
of
numb
the
whole
experience
ill
still
put

i
buy

theres
nothing

wrong
with
this

smooth
not

heavy
on

aside
from
a

i
found
it
to
be
pretty
dull
and
repetitive
all
in

a
sessionable
but
more
or
less
forgettable
beverage
d
its
so
pleasant
and
smooth
you
cant
really
turn
it
down
another
english
brew
that
is
predictable
to
the
point
of
frustration
for
an
english
strong
i
was
expecting
something
more
challenging
complex
and
characterful
it
turns
out
to
taste
just
like
a
thousand
other
english
brews
that
i
over
paid
for
an
undescript
malitiness
comes
through
in
the
nose

monkey

dark
ale
which
is
how
my
label
reads
isnt
very
strong
but
it
is
very
good
while
the
abv
may
be
a
fraction
too
high
for
it
to
quality
as
a
session
beer
id
love
to
travel
to
harrogate
and
give
it
a
whirl
a
delicious
beer
named
for
a
suspected
monkey
spy
read
the
label
that
tastes
like
bananas
what
could
be
better
than
that
md
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
spritzy
not
smooth
enough
to
seamlessly
match
the
rather
soothing
rich
yet
balanced
flavour
profile
though
it
softens
a
little
as
the
carbonation
evaporates
overall
this
is
a
malty
as
well
as
fruity
strong
bitter
with
its
nice
flavour
thats
shown
by
this
presumably
inferior
interpretation
of
the
ale
im
sure
the
cask
version
would
be
absolutely
a
hit
for
autumn
named
after
an
incident
in
hartlepool
england
that
involved
the
hanging
of
a
monkey
thought
to
have
been
a
french
spy
aaah
the
good
old
days
as
one
who
favors
big
hoppy
beers
i
actually
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
a
tasty
and
super
easy
to
imbibe
beer
here
a
tad
expensive
so
it
isnt
going
to
take
the
place
that
firestone
pale
ale
occupies
in
my
refrigerator
but
i
do
recommend
that
you
try
this
if
you
see
it
a
clean
brown
beer
with
ruby
highlights
has
a
creamy
off
white
head
there
is
an
overall
smooth
sweetness
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
dried
fruit
popping
up
here
and
there
the
taste
again
has
a
strong
sweet
character
with
a
caramel
note
up
front
a
nice
cocolaty
note
in
the
middle
and
some
coffee
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
delicious
treat
notes
tasty
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
the
more
i
gobbled
this
fine
product
the
more
i
was
planning
my
next
trip
to
wallys
in
westwood
for
more
from
daleside
at
over
5
for
a
500ml
bottle
i
wont
be
visiting
this
too
often
but
i
do
recommend
it
not
bad
in
the
least
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
english
hops
and
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
very
dry
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
semisweet
roasted
taste
its
malty
but
nothing
too
bold
it
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitternessmostly
english
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again

the
people
that
made
it
put
a

into

o
not
all

a

malty

for

tastes
more

would
have
balanced
it

abv
a
great
companion
on
a

night
overall
i
found
myself
liking
this
beer
and
craving
more
almost
right
away
its
unassuming
and
gently
flavorful
nice
malts

i
thoroughly
enjoy

this

to

in
the
colder
months
this
strong
ale
could
wear
the
winter
warmer
label
in
my
opinion
hearty
malty
and
high
abv
will
make
this
even
better
later
in
the
year
recommend
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
tasty
beer
i
have
to
admit
that
brown
ale
is
among
my
favorite
beer
varieties
and
i
am
therefor
biased
however
even
among
a
genre
of
which
i
am
inclined
this
beer
sticks
out
its
flavor
is
not
only
rich
but
it
is
distinct
among
brown
ales
it
is
not
too
harsh
and
is
remarkably
smooth
for
such
a
strong
flavor
i
usually
like
to
explore
new
beers
and
breweries
and
dont
often
buy
the
same
thing
twice
however
this
will
certainly
be
an
exception
o
a
good
strongold
ale
nice
and
warming
i
will
buy
this
one
again
next
time
i
am
in
new
england
pours
less
than
brown
almost
a
burnt
amber
orange
brown
small
amt
of
sudsy
khaki
colored
head
slight
hop
and
burnt
malt
aroma
flavors
are
well
balanced
some
burnt
spicy
peppery
notes
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
and
some
roast
in
the
back
end
o
i
like
this
one
and
would
drink
again
i
wish
there
was
a
website
for
the
brewer
otter
creek
so
i
could
read
their
take
on
this
ale
but
its
currently
under
construction
i
would
enjoy
this
again
occasionally
and
can
imagine
it
pairing
with
a
hearty
beef
stew
and
crusty
dark
bread
overall
great
ale
im
glad
i
took
a
risk
and
bought
a
case
very
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
with
7
4
abv
the
price
was
fair
too
personally
i
feel
this
is
well
suited
for
the
winter
give
it
a
try
complex
with
an
easybreezy
vibe
o
a
solid
english
strong
ale
american
strong
ales
are
more
my
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer
a
good
amount
of
flavor
albeit
not
real
complex
dangerously
drinkable
at
over
7
abv
paired
this
with
very
hot
wings
and
it
was
an
outstanding
combo
certainly
recommend
this
beer
while
not
a
session
beer
it
would
be
possible
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
just
because
theres
enough
going
on
here
as
the
favors
faded
into
a
anisettelicorice
combination
in
the
end
i
couldnt
help
but
notice
that
i
hadnt
quite
had
anything
like
this
before
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
an
imperial
brown
ale
this
would
be
a
good
example
of
how
to
brew
it
right
this
isnt
a
pushover
beer
but
at
the
same
time
its
hard
to
imagine
anyone
being
offended
by
whats
going
on
here
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
smooth
malty
sweet
brownred
ale
i
look
forward
to
the
colder
days
when
this
beer
will
taste
even
better
aka
vermont
by
the
way
i
use
a
fluted
wine
glass
to
drink
all
my
high
quality
beers
like
this
one
clear
chestnut
body
with
a
thin
light
beige
cap
modest
head
retention
with
a
bit
of
shortlived
lacing
malty
aroma
toffee
was
dominant
with
fainter
brown
sugar
and
nuts
hints
of
alcohol
butter
and
toast
appeared
as
the
beer
warmed
same
malty
character
in
the
flavour
but
with
moderate
bitterness
and
more
pronounced
nuttiness
faint
cola
herbal
and
alcohol
notes
towards
the
finish
decent
texture
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
a
pleasant
beer
that
drinks
easier
than
the
abv
would
lead
you
to
believe
at
first
the
taste
is
cloyingly
sweet
but
by
the
third
sip
the
hops
become
much
more
apparent
and
aggressive
surprising
how
drinkable
this
is
very
tasty
possibly
dangerous
happy
to
have
had
it
this
is
a
really
good
tasty
brown
ale
very
nice
balance
and
flavor
goes
down
smooth
a
definite
musttry
a
decent
english
style
beer
and
worthwhile
im
glad
that
my
roommate
shared
this
with
me
overall
pretty
decent
and
real
easy
drinking
for
7
4
also
o
overall
warm
nuttiness
with
earthy
silty
tea
stands
out
making
this
pretty
good
decent
complexity
definitely
one
of
the
better
american
browns
ive
come
across
in
awhile
this
from
right
across
the
lake
in
vermont
is
a
hopped
up
version
like
few
ive
had
it
pours
as
red
as
it
does
brown
especially
in
the
light
its
got
over
an
inch
off
tan
head
but
the
retention
is
rather
poor
still
a
creamy
rich
liquid
beckons
the
nose
is
a
great
balance
between
sweeter
english
and
american
malts
and
fresh
east
coast
hops
with
mild
acidity
a
little
woody
a
little
sweet
and
a
lot
yummy
the
taste
is
the
best
parts
of
the
nose
rich
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
do
their
thing
while
the
beer
finished
on
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
with
a
wide
variety
of
hop
flavors
and
feels
including
pine
and
sticky
ganja
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
of
this
alcoholic
strength
its
fuller
in
body
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
good
its
got
a
creamy
texture
and
seems
like
a
nitro
tap
would
make
this
elite
i
like
this
better
than
the
shed
ipa
and
i
look
forward
to
more
of
their
beers
this
is
excellent
and
its
even
better
on
tap
overall
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
nice
flavor
nothing
too
flashy
but
a
decent
easydrinking
robust
brown
ale
o
this
is
ok
a
very
yeasty
english
brown
ale
toasty
and
tealike
like
a
northern
english
brown
but
big
and
full
like
an
american
brown
neat
genre
straddler
but
not
something
id
buy
again
or
buy
in
the
first
place
technically
o
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
day
it
definitely
lives
up
to
being
described
as
a
rugged
brown
ale
on
the
label
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
not
one
id
care
to
have
again
good
an
interesting
beer
with
some
nice
complexities
reminded
me
of
a
doppelbock
kinda
it
is
early
so
i
decided
to
go
with
a
heavyhanded
pour
that
ended
up
producing
some
cascading
action
in
the
glass
it
also
produced
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
foamy
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
burnt
orange
highlights
and
just
a
touch
of
haze
in
terms
of
clarity
nose
had
an
interesting
mix
of
chocolate
malt
and
minty
evergreen
hops
it
is
girl
scout
cookie
season
and
this
made
me
think
of
thin
mints
the
lacing
that
had
begun
to
form
was
wonderfully
sticky
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
full
and
the
chocolate
malt
was
immediate
on
the
tongue
with
the
minty
hops
following
as
i
breathed
in
this
was
really
good
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
and
the
finish
really
did
have
a
thin
mint
cookie
quality
to
it
i
will
be
recommending
this
one
to
others
this
is
a
pretty
nice
one
decent
body
flavor
is
bringing
something
though
its
slightly
too
tangy
just
a
wee
bit
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
as
well
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
glad
to
be
able
to
try
something
from
a
new
to
me
brewery
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
from
them

nh
o
third
time
ive
had
this
beer
now
they
were
all
given
to
me
as
gifts
its
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
that
astounded
me
or
made
me
want
to
go
out
and
get
some
but
the
experience
was
enjoyable
and
memorable
this
is
more
like
an
english
brown
than
an
english
strong
the
flavor
was
more
muted
than
you
would
expect
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
deceptive
compared
to
the
abv
starts
with
darker
malt
but
in
the
swallow
is
a
good
dose
hop
in
shortwell
balanced
thin
bodied
with
a
level
of
carbonation
above

earthy
overall
with

low

this
brew
is
deceptively
smooth
for
a
7

it
goes
down
with
grace
enjoyed
wholeheartedly
o
nice
to
see
this
brand
brought
back
from
the
dead
this
is
a
good
beer
rich
flavorful
and
smooth
highly
drinkable
despite
its
size
you
would
not
know
that
this
is
7

abv
a
great
fall
beer
though
im
glad
its
offered
year
round
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
on
the
scene
crafted
with
care
to
produce
a
palatable
taste
overall
a
nicely
done
beer
and
perfect
for
a
night
by
the
fire
these
kinds
of
brown
ales
are
rapidly
being
lost
under
the
influences
of
more
hopforward
examples
so
its
nice
to
see
the
new
england
style
come
out
to
shine
recommended
pours
dark
amber
had
it
on
tap
at
jax
right
off
killington
mountial
tastes
great
a
boarder
line
american
pale
ale
but
had
a
hint
of
dark
belgian
after
taste
i
had
never
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
coming
to
vt
but
this
was
a
great
ale
and
id
love
to
try
some
of
their
happier
offerings
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
other
similar
beers
that
i
would
choose
first
i
found
this
brown
ale
to
have
a
very
unique
character
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
im
not
completely
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
certainly
would
recommend
this
over
some
most
of
the
other
duller
brown
ales
out
there
better
example
of
an
american
brown
ale
than
most
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
rubyhighlighted
brown
coloring
that
looks
dark
and
deep
a
thin
sparse
filmy
coating
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
is
all
you
get
for
head
aromas
of
rich
toffee
molasses
and
a
touch
of
roasty
qualities
smells
very
heavybig
but
not
overpowering
on
the
nose
flavors
are
much
more
roasted
than
the
nose
lets
on
with
the
rich
dark
sweet
flavors
entering
in
after
the
forward
punch
of
earth
and
roast
malty
profiles
overall
with
a
touch
of
bitter
coffee
at
the
end
to
draw
a
bitter
close
to
the
palate
roasty
and
blended
aftertaste
with
hints
of
the
dark
earthy
sweetness
you
just
tasted
as
well
as
the
bitterness
that
brought
everything
to
a
close
smooth
and
clean
in
mouth
with
a
slight
effervescence
at
the
end
of
the
drink
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
rich
roasty
finish
that
hangs
on
just
long
enough
to
bring
you
back
for
more
pretty
good
give
it
a
try
notes
a
very
large
malty
backbone
but
still
very
smooth
and
drinkable
cheers
overall
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
brown
ale
and
if
it
was
available
i
would
drink
it
but
it
is
not
memorable
and
does
not
warrant
going
out
of
the
way
to
find
otter
creek
taking
over
the
shed
brewery
may
have
made
this
more
mainstream
but
it
is
just
ok
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
really
like
because
it
moves
through
several
sensations
as
i
drink
it
it
begins
sweet
and
slightly
malty
coats
the
tongue
in
a
creamy
way
and
then
ends
with
a
low
to
moderate
bitterness
which
lingers
and
finishes
dry
i
had
this
on
tap
once
in
vermont
but
the
bottle
is
just
as
nice
overall
middle
of
the
road
in
nearly
every
category
the
nose
held
a
faint
promise
but
nothing
really
delivered
here
o
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
a
little
flat
a
little
watery
reminds
me
of
a
can
of
cola
left
open
overnight
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
nutty
some
hops
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
some
nuts
are
present
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
but
unspectacular
pours
a
deep
brown
with
reddish
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
caramel
and
light
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
not
much
of
a
nose
on
this
one
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
caramel
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
earth
and
mineral
water
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
strong
ale
is
a
real
stretch
for
this
brew
but
at
7

i
never
noticed
the
abv
this
drinks
more
like
a
brown
ale
but
even
at
that
its
really
bland
nice
to
try
but
i
doubt
id
pick
it
up
again
oda
good
6pack
of
strong
ale
definitely
a
hybrid
tht
balances
between
styles
i
enjoyed
this
single
vermont
to
the
rescue
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
bottled
in
early
october
pours
a
a
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lace
smell
is
biscuit
brown
sugar
some
carmel
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
more
aggressive
with
burnt
brown
sugar
and
roasted
almonds
leading
the
way
body
is
medium
large
plenty
of
carbonation
not
dry
and
drinkability
is
easy
this
is
a
nice
brew
not
earth
shattering
nice
price
feels
like
an
english
brown
ale
with
a
slight
belgian
influence
thrown
in
there
and
a
decent
amount
of
hops
i
would
be
very
interested
in
what
yeast
strain
they
used
interesting
beer
for
sure
and
not
what
i
expected
going
in
after
last
weeks
disaster
with
trout
river
choclate
stout
i
was
a
little
gun
shy
about
adventuring
into
something
else
i
have
seen
shed
around
but
never
triied
it
until
tonite
the
suprise
i
got
tonite
was
one
i
would
welcome
anytime
i
spent
the
same
money
about
9
00
for
6
but
this
time
instead
of
anemic
flat
disgusting
rusty
barrel
water
i
discovered
an
amazing
beer
everything
is
right
here
pours
dark
with
a
beautiful
creamy
head
full
bodied
high
quality
malt
with
a
light
hop
finish
this
is
an
amazing
beer
they
dont
get
any
better

what
else
could
one
want
really
good
flavors
with
none
of
that
fruitiness
that
can
sometimes
take
away
from
a
good
malty
brew
really
clean
with
flavors
that
go
well
together
and
an
incredible
balance

tastes
like
it

pretty

nice
overall
robust
winter

i
could
see
downing
a
few
of
these
while
up
in
the
cold
mountains
keep
me
warm
and
decent
flavor
and
for
what
it
is
it
has
a
big
flavor
but
still
fairly
drinkable
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
pours
a
deep
chestnut
hue
with
ruby
highlights
when
backlit
head
is
three
inches
dense
offwhite
and
creamy
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
frothy

tasting

a
hint
of

datesfigs

taste
consistent
with

no
aspect
really
stands
out
per
se
but
it
all
coalesces
together
nicely
there
may
even
be
a
trace
of
coffee
present
in
the
flavor
profile
behind
the
fruit
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
overall
this
comes
off
as
a
slightly
more
flavorful
brown
ale
i
think
this
beer
would
be
quite
pleasant
oncask
but
im
afraid
it
would
be
dangerously
drinkable
the
7
40
abv
is
very
wellhidden
i
like
this
okay
id
prefer
a
mellower
more
drinkable
brown
ale
this
is
basically
just
a
stronger
brown
ale
overall
i
was
pretty
pleased
with
this
beer
hearty
yet
drinkable
medium
body
and
carbonation
feels
smooth
and
has
a
little
heft
to
it
average
drinkability
tasty
but
not
super
exciting
a
little
one
dimensional
perhaps
d
quite
drinkable
but
i
would
like
a
touch
more
balance
rather
than
a
flash
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
this
was
3
99
for
a
pint
or
basically
about
18
00
for
a
six
pack
at
that
price
level
this
beer
should
have
me
saying
wow
at
that
price
however
it
only
had
me
saying
gee
while
i
found
this
one
interesting
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
english
ales
id
love
to
try
it
again
on
tap
and
see
if
the
taste
is
different
in
draught
form
but
maybe
ill
try
other
otter
beers
and
see
if
those
are
more
my
speed
from
the
1
pt
0
9
fl
oz
bottle
and
sampled
on
july
11
2009
it
pours
amberbrown
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
carbonation
bubbles
clung
to
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
and
gave
off
an
appearance
not
unlike
tiny
ice
crystals
although
it
was
served
at
about
40
degrees
they
say
that
it
is
brewed
with
spring
water
and
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
for
this
unique
look
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
tinge
of
fruit
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
in
the
medium
range
with
the
smooth
texture
of
honey
a
good
english
bitter
taste
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
tasty
and
true
to
my
favorite
style
d
very
good
per
style
and
very
good
drinkability
this
may
make
its
way
into
the
rotation
more
often
i
like
this
a
lot
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
ice
cold
it
may
be
quenching
and
unnoticeable
but
im
goin
british
tonight
and
this
otter
is
rife
with
character
and
nutritious
goodness
my
only
gripe
is
the
addition
of
wheat
oats
and
spelt
which
add
more
flavor
but
ultimately
blend
things
together
a
little
too
much
for
me
i
like
crisp
lines
for
what
it
is
though
a
superb
pub
drink
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
caramel
nose
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
that
changes
to
a
slight
bitter
finish

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial

acton
ma
style
is
more
like
a

than
an
english

and
slippery

the
mouth
broken
up
by
a
zing
of
carbonation

although
thinly
weighted
the
beers
carbonation
is
a
bit
rough
especially
in
the
swallow
at
4
50
a
bottle
this
doesnt
warrant
another
purchase
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
overall
a
tasty
ale
that
seemed
stronger
than
the
5

abv
this
following
a
hoppy
otter
is
nice
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
orangebrown
color
with
a
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
low
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
caramel
breaddough
toffee
and
dried
fruit
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
starts
off
malty
and
then
the
hops
come
out
in
the
finish
and
linger
around
for
a
while
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
and
creamy
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
dont
know
if
id
call
this
a
strong
ale
but
im
not
complaining
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
it
again
the
label
claims
brewed
with
oats
and
rye
i
didnt
find
those
anywhere
in
the
beer
this
one
was
completely
new
to
me
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
worth
a
shot
although
it
is
certainly
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
out
there
for
my
money
fullers
1845
and
adnams
broadside
strong
original
are
still
the
cream
of
the
english
strong
ale
crop
otter
head
while
good
isnt
a
beer
that
im
tempted
to
give
another
go
round
its
still
worth
a
look
for
anyone
interested
in
the
style
drinkability
more
an
esb
than
an
english
strong
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
have
crossed
the
pond
in
recent
years
too
bad
the
weak
dollar
is
working
against
bringing
in
the
better
brews
of
the
uk
nice
copper
color
with
avergage
head
retention
and
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
hotalchol
side
for
5

malty
sweetness
is
the
first
quality
noticed
with
its
smell
and
taste
some
caramel
hints
as
well
easy
to
consume
for
a
strong
ale
enjoyed
this
one
at
the
charlotte
oktoberfest
and
would
definitely
try
again
it
smelled
a
little
like
apples
actually
and
was
slightly
bitter
and
a
little
malty
anvery
flat
tasting
will
not
buy
again
otter
head
is
a
pretty
respekkible
beer
but
seeing
as
i
can
only
find
it
sold
in
singles
for
4
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
it
often
dvery
nice
ale
one
i
would
get
again
and
would
like
to
try
on
cask
medium
bodied
overall
its
not
bad
but
cant
say
it
stands
out
when
compared
to
others
of
style
ive
had
from
england
its
been
awhile
since
i
have
had
a
true
english
pale
ale
so
i
picked
this
up
todaypoured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
a
slight
hazed
lighter
shade
of
copper
with
a
thin
wispy
head
seems
lightly
carbonated
light
aromas
mainly
english
malt
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
sweet
dough
faint
green
hop
lingersthinner
on
the
mouth
but
its
very
quaffable
a
real
sociable
pint
malt
tilted
in
my
mind
lightly
sweet
like
brown
sugar
and
faint
caramel
somewhat
drying
in
the
finish
with
geraniumlike
quality
not
a
world
beater
but
iam
quite
sure
it
wasnt
intended
to
be
i
could
drink
it
all
night
and
not
miss
a
beat
iam
surprised
at
the
alc
really
ill
keep
it
short
and
sweet
this
one
looked
ok
smelled
better
nice
sweet
malt
character
and
a
subtle
hop
taste
thas
was
not
bitter
at
all
the
soft
water
this
is
made
with
was
really
impressive
coupled
with
a
simple
modest
recipe
that
uses
great
ingredients
a
quality
beer
is
born
simple
and
pure
good
beer
all
around
d
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
more
it
seems
that
when
i
buy
one
of
these
imperial
pint
english
beers
i
expect
cloyingly
sweet
heavy
ales
that
are
high
in
quality
yet
rarely
prefered
this
beer
hits
home
for
me
with
a
lot
of
subtleties
character
and
balance
in
a
clean
and
refreshing
delight
the
beer
boasts
of
marris
otter
malts
that
shine
with
a
firm
barley
sweetness
browned
bread
not
quite
toasted
and
a
subtle
yet
firm
caramel
toffee
note
this
is
evident
in
the
aromas
with
as
esteryspicy
character
of
fresh
fruits
and
fresh
hops
decorated
with
a
creamy
head
retention
although
slight
remains
with
the
beer

the
bottom
of

glass
moderately
hazed

mildly
carbonated

the

up

whiskey
per
say
to
speak
of
but
plenty
of
charred
barrel
flavour
strange
brew
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
after
all
yes
but
after
a
while
a
bit
too
monotone
the
saints
is
an
excellent
way
to
wean
someone
onto
scotch
with
only
one
real
feature
peatiness
however
it
is
hardly
the
long
storyteller
that
a
good
single
malt
is
but
it
does
offer
at
least
a
superficial
taste
of
what
distinguishes
many
of
the
finest
whiskeys
albeit
without
any
of
the
complexity
elegance
or
alcohol
burn
st
peters
is
hit
and
miss
and
this
offering
could
fall
on
either
side
depending
on
your
tastes
deep
yellow
coloured
without
a
head
the
aroma
is
big
peat
whiskey
whiskey
and
wood
and
thats
what
i
get
in
the
taste
highly
carbonated
not
so
drinkable
like
a
cheap
watered
down
whiskey
why
drink
it
at
all
i
could
not
at
least
it
was
not
high
abv
lcbo
acquisition
brewed
ok
for
what
it
is
big
whiskey
fans
may
like
this
good
luck
light
body
decent
carbonation
ps
if
you
dont
like
heavy
peat
scotch
you
wont
like
this
but
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
the
peat
flavour
in
this
beer
as
some
reviewers
have
noted
sorry
but
what
the
hell
were
they
thinking
when
they
made
this
looks
fine
but
after
that
its
completely
offensive
wow
not
as
well
balanced
a
beer
as
ive
enjoyed
from
this
brewery
in
the
past
will
certainly
try
the
brewery
again
but
will
not
buy
a
second
one
of
these
reddish
orange
with
some
forced
white
bubbles
as
a
head
low
carbonation
it
appears
nose
has
some
skunkweed
initially
green
bottles
with
strong
peat
earth
and
burnt
firewood
upon
closer
inspection
taste
rehashes
this
a
ton
of
peat
smoke
and
light
malt
character
really
intense
and
offputting
light
breadiness
in
the
malt
light
body
bitter
and
lingering
peat
i
can
take
these
flavours
in
moderation
but
this
is
way
over
the
top
for
the
mood
im
in
drainpour
o
good
to
have
one
in
the
evening
and
sure
goes
awesome
with
cheese
and
crackers
had
it
with
smoked
gooda
blue
cheese
and
havarti
with
oysters
amazing
o
i
really
liked
the
smokey
peat
notes
but
the
ashy
finish
was
definitely
a
turnoff
worth
a
try
and
a
brew
that
would
receive
a
wide
ranging
reviews
given
the
flavour
profile
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
nonetheless
clear
golden
colour
near
2
fingers
white
head
sticky
with
lots
of
lace
smell
is
full
of
smoke
and
peat
with
a
little
bit
of
biscuity
malt
underneath
and
to
a
lesser
degree
a
bit
of
floral
hop
but
mostly
just
smoke
and
peat
taste
a
strange
mix
of
smoke
and
biscuity
malts
peat
is
certainly
there
but
this
honestly
just
tastes
like
smokey
salt
water
light
carbonation
light
mouthfeel
pretty
average
feel
didnt
get
through
much
of
this
really
not
my
thing
here
something
i
really
should
have
passed
on
hmmmm
im
not
loving
this
though
its
perhaps
a
matter
of
personal
taste
it
does
what
it
says
on
the
tin
theres
plenty
of
whisky
character
in
this
beer
however
i
find
it
excessive
and
unbalanced
you
could
be
forgiven
for
not
realising
that
this
is
a
beer
the
first
impression
is
that
someones
dumped
tcp
into
your
pint
its
a
very
strong
aromaflavour
after
a
mouthful
or
two
you
can
begin
to
tease
out
the
aromatic
components
and
analyse
them
medicinal
and
solventy
the
underlying
beer
never
stands
a
chance
to
make
an
impact
this
would
probably
benefit
from
having
the
whisky
toned
back
somewhat
though
im
sure
there
are
those
who
love
it
divisive
if
you
love
peaty
whiskies
then
this
is
the
brew
for
you
caveat
emptor
a
miss
for
me
not
sure
why
this
brew
was
part
of
the
release
other
than
for
the
sheer
novelty
an
interesting
experiment
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
balance
of
other
beers
of
the
same
style
overall
not
my
kind
of
beer
if
youre
in
the
market
for
something
oddinteresting
tasting
then
give
this
one
a
try
the
taste
grew
on
me
but
i
just
think
this
one
smells
awful
and
cant
enjoy
it
was
expecting
a
sweet
scotch
ale
type
of
beer
but
this
is
made
for
fans
of
smoke
or
chipotle
beers
the
nose
is
all
peat
smoke
and
wood
fires
as
is
the
taste
id
never
have
guessed
this
was
a
whisky
beer
if
i
hadnt
poured
it
myself
ashtray
smokey
and
much
too
much
for
my
palate
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
my
wife
took
a
sniff
and
refused
to
help
it
nearly
went
on
the
bratwursts
as
a
marinade
but
she
didnt
like
the
sound
of
that
either
im
sure
some
people
will
rave
about
it
but
it
isnt
for
me
overall
interesting
good
but
not
great
still
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
an
interesting
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
peated
whisky
so
this
flavour
worked
for
me
would
i
try
again
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
i
would
happily
raise
a
glass
if
someone
gave
me
a
bottle
quite
a
unique
beer
and
i
do
reccomend
trying
it
for
a
couple
of
quid
from
waitrose
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
scotch
ale
a
bit
high
on
the
carbonation
and
a
bit
onesided
in
the
taste
too
much
emphasis
on
the
smoky
peaty
part
of
it
and
not
enough
development
elsewhere
a
good
beer
i
might
by
it
again
but
ive
had
subtler
smoother
whisky
beers
md
the
mouthfeel
is
generally
refreshing
while
carbonation
always
at
medium
level
which
i
like
all
in
all
this
whiskyflavoured
beer
i
guess
whisky
was
added
to
the
maturation
stage
instead
of
fermentation
is
an
easydrinking
rather
well
integrated
one
for
any
peaty
whisky
lover
or
at
least
for
me
where
the
complexity
of
beer
has
been
neutralised
whisky
contributes
a
naughty
dimension
to
the
overall
tasting
experience
st
peters
brewery
works
with
st
georges
distillery
to
create
this
beer
it
pours
a
clear
brown
unexciting
with
little
to
no
head
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
however
is
quite
exciting
if
you
like
whiskey
which
you
should
if
you
bought
this
beer
the
nose
is
all
whiskey
peaty
malty
whiskey
so
much
that
i
feel
like
i
can
smell
the
alcohol
but
as
this
is
only
4
8
i
doubt
that
is
what
i
am
smelling
again
there
is
no
other
way
to
describe
this
beer
other
than
whiskey
flavored
i
mean
it
is
like
a
maltier
scotch
and
soda
with
a
hint
of
beer
the
palate
is
a
bit
thin
and
over
carbonated
and
overall
it
is
not
one
that
i
will
be
buying
again
but
it
is
exactly
as
advertised
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
this
a
big
butt
for
some
reason
it
was
decided
to
do
smoke
it
is
over
the
top
and
i
am
pushing
this
pint
away
o
a
fabulous
brew
from
rushing
duck
i
am
really
glad
we
checked
out
this
barrestaurant
capital
city
gastropub
in
albany
and
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
i
was
a
little
sad
that
the
experimental
naysayer
pale
ale
was
not
available
but
i
am
really
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
nimptopsical
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
a
great
malthops
balance
and
an
unique
superb
mouthfeel
excellent
and
check
out
more
rushing
duck
offerings
if
you
can
find
them
in
new
york
state
simple
but
refreshing
mouth
feel
a
nice
lighter
styled
darkbrown
beer
with
enjoyable
features
nothing
about
this
beer
says
holidays
to
me
or
english
strong
ale
for
that
matter
more
of
an
dark
english
mild
save
for
the
still
modest
alcohol
by
volume
dark
nut
brown
color
half
inch
of
lazy
tan
head
thats
relatively
stagnant
doesnt
go
anywhere
the
nose
is
sweet
and
earthy
english
malts
chocolate
malt
and
a
sweetness
i
dont
all
the
way
like
lots
of
stale
smelling
ale
yeast
too
give
it
a
funny
metallic
ting
i
dont
dislike
the
flavor
which
is
all
grin
forward
dark
but
not
unmalted
roast
barley
dark
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
either
which
i
appreciate
no
holiday
spice
at
all
somewhat
of
a
letdown
in
a
beer
thats
not
particularly
flavorful
it
reminds
me
of
a
lower
quality
sam
smiths
product
from
a
yeast
standpoint
which
some
may
love
but
i
dont
favor
it
lacks
the
properties
that
make
a
holiday
beer
special
for
me
rich
and
robust
in
body
though
which
helps
a
lot
and
only
gently
carbonated
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
much
bigger
ale
nothing
special
here
overall
in
my
eyes
o
a
terrific
beer
ticks
near
all
the
boxes
required
for
this
class
a
full
flavored
sweet
yet
well
balanced
strong
english
brown
ale
which
packs
a
punch
a
delightful
beer
and
one
of
my
favourites
from
england
yet
much
credit
and
respect
to
the
brewing
team
at
hook
norton
overall
its
fine
but
really
not
that
exciting
when
an
english
ale
like
this
is
good
it
can
really
be
phenomenal
this
one
is
not
that
howeverit
feels
like
a
bythenumbers
brown
perhaps
with
a
little
more
weight
behind
it
than
youd
usually
get
but
missing
the
edge
that
would
make
it
something
special
pours
just
like
kola
beer
with
a
one
finger
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
rim
of
lacing
and
leggy
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
dried
fruitsraisinsbooze
and
cotton
candythe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
tastes
are
pretty
much
just
like
any
other
dark
english
ale
without
the
booze
its
basically
toffeedried
fruitsraisins
and
finished
with
a
herbal
earthy
bitternessoverall
if
you
havnt
tried
it
you
aint
missing
much
cheers
o
very
enjoyable
beer
well
worth
checking
out
pours
dark
brown
beer
with
tan
head
good
foam
retention
nice
smell
dark
fruits
chocolate
roasted
malts
decent
taste
close
to
porters
roasted

in
the

some

roundness
rather
warming
with
evident
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mediumbodied
balanced
and
fullflavoured
esa
o
promised
alot
at
first
with
pleasant
aromas
upfront
i
was
slightly
disappointed
with
the
taste
which
lacks
a
little
intensity
and
complex
flavours
to
that
of
a
good
dark
ale
but
nonetheless
very
drinkable
on
a
cold
winters
evening
rare
dud
for
hn
a
decent
english
ale
full
of
flavour
but
not
overly
complex
good
right
up
my
alley
this
one
so
a
little
biased
nice
deep
dark
red
tan
colour
with
thick
head
and
some
lacing
on
a
pint
handle
aroma
is
a
little
fruitcake
and
roast
im
olfactorily
challenged
so
aroma
scores
are
a
bit
sketchy
flavour
is
roasted
malt
with
plum
and
fruitcake
as
youd
expect
good
bitterness
on
the
back
palate
so
i
didnt
find
it
cloying
at
all
boozy
according
to
doktorhop
i
guess
it
is
a
little
but
the
flavour
is
big
enough
to
pull
it
off
a
bit
chewy
at
the
end
but
thats
just
lipsmackin
style
and
i
found
that
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
pleasant
ale
and
i
would
like
some
more
food
match
the
bottle
states
cheese
platter
and
i
dont
disagree
other
than
that
a
nice
game
bird
roast
would
work
well
jamie
olivers
roast
of
incredible
game
birds
with
proper
polenta
is
a
great
place
to
start
overall
an
interesting
english
ale
with
a
reasonably
restrained
flavour
the
flavours
that
do
come
through
however
are
well
considered
and
bounce
off
each
other
nicely
overall
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
dry
add
0
5
for
the
aus
price
point
o
its
alright
for
a
uk
beer
but
not
spectacular
the
body
is
medium
and
has
a
bit
of
smoothness
but
opts
for
crispness
in
the
overall
feel
from
a
carbonation
thats
just
right
for
this
beer
i
came
in
with
moderate
expectations
and
they
were
blown
off
the
hinges
this
is
one
of
the
better
english
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
long
long
time
an
interesting
christmas
ale
with
a
restrained
character
all
the
aromas
and
flavours
are
subtle
yet
this
beer
achieves
a
nuanced
complexity
no
spice
but
a
definite
chocolate
note
makes
itself
known
lovely
body
rewards
the
perceptive
beer
drinker
well
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
notes
magnificent
tasty
a
brown
ale
with
richness
and
malty
goodness
dark
copper
with
a
decent
if
somewhat
porous
white
head
earthy
malts
raisin
hints
of
spice
and
christmas
pudding
nice
earthy
malts
light
buttery
character
raisin
and
even
a
bit
of
brandy
quite
pleasant
but
a
little
rough
on
the
finish
at
first
this
is
a
little
too
carbonated
but
it
eases
off
as
the
beer
breathes
good
dessert
beer
but
a
bit
rough
and
high
in
alcohol
to
be
a
true
session
ale
overall
this
is
an
average
offering
but
it
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
for
the
strong
ale
category
and
the
foreign
pricepointsmall
bottle
size
also
detracts
from
needing
to
revisit
this
anytime
soon
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
brownish
red
color
with
a
tan
head
the
head
sinks
down
to
a
thin
white
film
that
lays
over
the
top
of
the
beer
this
beer
wasnt
really
a
holiday
beer
to
me
i
suppose
there
were
some
spices
in
it
but
it
wasnt
very
pronounced
this
brew
get
a
little
better
tasting
once
it
warms
up
a
bit
this
beer
might
be
ideal
having
it
from
a
cask
d
very
drinkablewould
certainly
buy
this
again
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
it
wont
be
the
last
i
would
love
to
visit
oxfordshire
to
see
the
source
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
christmas
ales
ive
had
this
year
d
not
something
i
would
repeat
it
was
fun
for
a
while
but
this
beer
becomes
quite
cloying
after
just
a
small
glass
drinkability
i
was
having
a
hankering
for
a
beer
with
a
distictive
english
flavor
and
a
winter
beer
this
is
both
wrapped
into
one
and
is
definitely
recommended
overall
a
great
winter
warmer
just
like
their
stout
d
on
the
whole
a
solid
drinkable
beer
an
ok
beer
lacked
that
x
factor
which
i
hoped
for
another
chesnut
colored
winter
warmer
into
a
imperial
nonica
well
formed
creamylike
tan
colored
head
atop
big
juicy
fruit
malt
in
the
nose
mixed
with
caramelbiscuit
maltthe
fruit
really
jumped
in
your
face
and
was
nice
flavors
are
of
fruit
cakes
with
a
tinge
of
nuttinessvery
fruit
forward
its
a
nice
winter
beer
thats
not
hot
or
overly
sweeta
very
nice
winter
beer
in
my
opinion
conclusion
a
wonderful
tasty
winter
warmer
in
classic
english
style
went
wonderfully
with
a
grilled
red
leicester
and
tomato
sandwich
clear
deep
redbrown
pour
with
quickly
fading
head
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
hazelnut
vanilla
figs
and
caramel
the
taste
is
much
the
same
but
more
of
a
roasty
almost
burnt
chocolate
comes
out
as
it
warms
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
nothing
special
a
little
disappointing
d
terrific
silky
buttery
malty
nutty
goodness
all
in
a
5
5
package
its
much
more
than
a
xmas
enjoyment
ill
be
sipping
this
all
summer
found
a
supply
for
3
99
a
bottle
on
sale
one
of
my
few
repeat
purchases
d
two
or
three
around
the
holidays
would
definitely
be
enjoyed
overall
a
very
nice
and
quite
festive
brew
recommended
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
color
with
a
big
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
laces
rather
nicely
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
spices
mostly
dark
fruits
in
taste
but
hints
of
ginger
spice
and
caramel
also
some
buttery
notes
slight
but
pleasant
bitter
finish
very
interesting
and
complex
brew
drinkable
but
not
one
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
in
one
sitting
of
overall
a
pleasant
experiance
d
its
drinkable
but
not
in
the
good
way
d
goes
down
easily
probably
could
do
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
but
ill
take
my
time
with
it
not
your
typical
christmas
ale
not
very
christmassy
at
all
really
but
enjoyable
one
additional
note
i
really
like
the
bottle
design
with
the
label
and
back
panel
description
of
the
brewery
extra
kudos
dark
chestnut
amber
with
a
pock
marked
sand
colored
head
that
lasts
awhile
and
sticks
to
the
glass
this
beer
smells
of
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
black
licorice
with
mild
minty
hops
roasty
dark
chocolate
and
toasted
nuts
with
cocoa
and
herbal
hop
notes
balance
nicely
and
finish
fairly
dry
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
im
not
sure
about
the
style
but
make
no
mistake
twelve
days
is
indeed
a
good
ale
the
bottle
says
english
christmas
ale
the
ba
description
is
english
strong
ale
but
i
think
it
tastes
more
like
a
nut
brown
ale
poured
into
a
squatters
true
pint
glass
and
it
still
was
left
short
of
a
true
pint
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
good
dose
of
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
sweet

with
some
vanilla

a

nutty
note
medium
body
a
nice
smoothcreamy
brew
drinkable
a
nice
one
d
a
good
brew
with
some
interesting
tastes
but
could
definitely
be
a
bit
more
festive
d
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
christmas
ale
it
isnt
very
strong
as
its
classfied
but
it
is
very
good
and
easy
drinking
slightly
toasty
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
silky
chocolate
malt
toffee
caramel
hazelnut
roasted
coffee
and
burnt
toast
theres
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
chocolate
and
deep
roasted
flavor
that
somewhat
dominates
the
palate
slightly
bitter
with
a
subtle
lactic
creaminess
with
all
of
the
dark
roasted
malts
the
body
is
still
slightly
thin
and
the
nut
profile
and
roasted
bitter
notes
are
a
bit
much
i
wish
the
sweetness
was
a
little
more
prominent
creating
more
balance
pretty
complex
for
a
british
brown
ale
but
still
kind
of
underwhelming
drinkability
its
fairly
decent
and
delightfully
nutty
like
many
of
my
exgirlfriends
while
nothing
beyond
the
label
and
name
inspires
any
christmastime
imagery
it
is
a
decent
wellbalanced
ale
regardless
of
season
a
good
englishstyle
ale
with
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
for
its
size
twelve
days
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
malt
with
some
earthy
tones
theres
probably
a
touch
of
english
hops
in
there
but
its
light
its
somewhere
between
a
bock
and
a
good
english
brown
ale
the
flavor
is
relatively
sweet
but
nowhere
near
cloying
i
can
see
what
theyre
getting
at
with
the
nutty
descriptor
but
its
more
earth
to
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
gets
pretty
thin
as
i
drain
the
glass
i
imagine
its
a
lot
better
from
a
cask
m
this
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
no
alcohol
heat
d
a
little
fruity
i
the
dark
malts
but
thin
until
the
bitter
finish
d
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
decent
flavor
and
drinkability
a
typical
english
ale
really
i
dont
get
why
its
christmas
but
its
decent
nonetheless
drinkability
is
just
ok
as
this
is
a
bit
one
sided
on
the
sugary
maltyness
tasty
drinkable
bottle
obtained
recently
from
premiere
gourmet
pours
reddish
brown
with
spicey
nose
nicely
integrated
spiciness
though
not
thick
mouthfeel
caramel
makes
it
a
breeze
to
drink
reports
in
nicely
with
its

you
can
still
function
satisfying

a
bit
of

the

would
be
money
well
spent
ive
had
this
bottle
sitting
in
my
cellar
since
middle
of
last
year
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
lacking
in
body
and
flavour
but
i
was
surprised
maybe
this
needs
to
age
overall
great
malt
nice
but
not
overwhelming
fruity
hops
im
not
big
on
superhopped
stuff
and
a
great
full
flavour
typically
im
drinking
stuff
in
the
higher
alcohol
range
so
i
wasnt
expecting
as
solid
a
beer
in
an

this
is
like
most
english
beers
a
medium
bodied
beer
that

this
is
a
friendly
drinkable
ale
that
should
make
any
holiday

a
bit
more
jolly
d
notes
i
would
not
define
this
as
a
strong
ale
maybe
a
kicked
up
brown
still
good
though
a
bold
beer
this
is
dark
and
strongas
the
label
states
very
drinkable

might
need
to
buy
this
again
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
labeled
as
a
christmas
ale
good
drinkable
beer
some
more

a

would
be

a
step
above
from
a
standard

warmer
with

quite
nice
this
is
a
very
good
christmas
beer
it
has
elements
of

english
christmas

is
both
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
bombastic
big
beer
is
all
well
and
good
but
restraint
is
sometimes
the
way
to
go
for
what
its
worth
ive
had
this
bottle
for
more
than
a
year
and
it
has
held
up
beautifully
merry
christmas
to
all
and
to
all
a
good
nap
pours
a
clear
brown
with
no
head
the
nose
stays
mostly
caramel
nice
smooth
and
even
earthy
and
leafy
character
on
the
flavor
profile
smooth
feel
but
not
a
mess
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
ale
its
even
and
smooth
which
makes
it
a
great
one
to
try
aroma
is
strong
and
richly
malty
with
a
strong
overtone
of
brown
sugar
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thick
finebubbled
offwhite
head
that
stays
around
flavor
is
malty
with
ribbons
of
brown
sugar
or
molasses
and
smoky
and
nutty
hints
aftertaste
is
rather
sweet
but
not
cloying
there
is
just
a
whisper
of
hop
bitterness
a
delightful
ale
notes
i
wouldnt
classify
this
as
approachable
even
with
its
laid
back
style
it
has
some
issues
with
the
bitter
side
that
doesnt
translate
well
on
the
palate
malt
bill
is
the
best
part
of
this
and
would
make
it
worthy
if
they
can
figure
out
the
other
side
pass
a
tasty
very
drinkable
smooth
maltaccented
with
a
nice

english

chestnut
with
a
thin

that
fades
to
a
ring
caramel
aromas
as
well
as
a
nuttiness
and
slightly
spicy
tastes
of
hazlenuts
and
cream
with
a
slight
sweetness
round
and
mild
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
mild
christmas
brew
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
drinks
really
nice
shame
this
was
about
6
a
pint
one
of
the
best
winter
beers
ive
had
this
year
so
far
the
guys
at
cloverleaf
wine
really
pushed
this
beer
as
something
great
im
skeptical
of
british
beers
because
they
usually
lack
the
strong
flavors
of
american
brews
however
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
as
a
christmas
beer
the
appearance
is
reminiscent
of
liquid
gingerbread
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
sweet
the
taste
is
very
nice
like
spice
cookies
with
some
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
nothing
objectionable
with
the
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
christmas
beer
easy
drinking
with
very
nice
flavors
recommended
pours
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
slim
finger
of
head
and
light
lacing
smells
of
nutty
toasted
malts
and
gentle
herbal
hops
flavor
is
more
maltforward
a
base
of
toasted
caramel
malt
develops
nutty
and
doughy
notes
in
the
center
and
slightly
bitter
herbal
hop
and
hard
water
tones
in
the
finish
faintly
smoky
aftertaste
lingers
body
is
creamy
and
mediumlight
with
only
slight
carbonation
pleasant
but
not
particularly
noteworthy
i
like
this
english
ale
but
one
is
enough
at
a
time
poured
from
a
uniquelooking
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
dark
brown
clear
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
was
mostly
toasted
malt
biscuity
and
nutty
same
with
the
flavor
toasted
and
burnt
malts
and
a
hint
of
some
light
fruits
the
beer
was
fullbodied
and
filling
nicely
complex
but
not
really
my
style
the
pour
is
a
somewhat
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
modest
light
tan
creamy
head
that
fails
quickly
leaving
a
velum
like
coating
of
lace
nose
has
a
sweet
rich
malt
aroma
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hops
spicy
and
pleasant
front
is
quite
sweet
decently
malted
with
a
touch
of
the
bittering
hops
at
the
back
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
fair
to
middling
acidity
the
hops
delectable
in
their
spiciness
sweet
and
dry
aftertaste
lingers
long
on
the
palate
a
quite
nice
beer
drinkability
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
quite
drinkable
i
wonder
to
what
degree
the
apparent
perfection
of
this
beer
depends
on
its
freshness
it
just
arrived
from
england
by
way
of
normal
state
distribution
the
aromas
of
this
reddish
brown
liquid
are
an
alluring
mixture
of
caramel
malts
vanilla
cream
butter
baked
red
apples
red
currants
sweet
strawberries
brown
bread
crust
mashed
hazelnuts
and
almonds
coffee
and
straw
voluptuous
creamy
texture
with
a
biscuity
crumb
lifts
the
bread
and
fruit
flavors
until
they
meet
with
oozing
bitter
tannins
the
resolution
is
bright
and
fresh
bittersweet
and
fascinating
irresistable
texture
and
organization
astonishing
drinkability
recommended
easily
a
session
beer
as
it
is
somewhat
thin
bodied
and
lighter
in
flavors
pours
a
clear
deep
reddish
brown
cheery
wood
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
sugary
sweet
candied
pears
taste
is
lightly
toasted
grain
and
mild
pear
not
nearly
as
slick
and
syrupy
as
expected
body
is
medium
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
an
astringent
bite
but
that
fades
rather
quickly
into
a
tart
slightly
sour
rather
nice
not
sure
if
5
5
qualifies
as
a
strong
ale
but
i
was
not
disappointed
ha
i
just
noticed
the
pears
on
the
front
label
i
guess
the
pear
was
intentional
md
softlycarbonated
for
a
bottled
ale
and
the
body
is
just
medium
for
its
alc
strength
overall
this
is
a
quality
nutmalty
as
well
as
fruity
premium
bitter
and
the
ideal
body
and
balanced
flavour
make
it
a
moreish
pint
to
enjoy
a
strong
porter
chesnuts
caramel
woodsmoke
dried
fruit
like
raisins
fits
in
perfectly
with
the
holidays
as
a
warming
thick
brew
im
not
much
of
a
porter
lover
but
this
was
quite
drinkable
bottle
tasted
only
color
is
bread
crust
brown
texture
is
very
smooth
d
a
very
sessionable
ale
however
nothing
that
suggests
its
something
out
of
the
ordinary
malty
aroma
has
a
strong
overtone
of
ginger
i
like
ginger
pours
a
dark
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
thick
fluffy
wheat
head
ginger
overpowers
all
the
other
flavors
malt
and
a
hint
of
woody
hops
i
like
ginger
but
this
tastes
more
like
ginger
ale
than
the
real
stuff
smooth
texture
has
good
body
and
is
quite
fizzy
tasty
but
maybe
next
time
lighten
up
on
the
ginger
sil
vous
plait
this
beer
loses
points
for
the
rapidly
diminishing
head
and
poor
lacing
but
as
a
ginger
beer
picks
up
points
because
the
ginger
does
not
overpower
everything
else
i
love
ginger
beer
and
i
love
beer
here
we
have
ginger
beer
with
real
beer
love
it
its
a
fairly
sweet
brew
with
a
dominant
ginger
smell
and
flavor
theres
a
bit
of
malt
and
perhaps
some
hops
but
this
beer
is
about
ginger
mouthfeel
is
definitely
a
cross
between
beer
and
soda
i
am
really
enjoying
this
of
course
you
better
like
ginger
if
you
grab
one
of
these
but
if
you
do
its
a
sweet
gingery
treat
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
normal
beers
and
ales
be
careful
it
goes
down
fast
4450
overall
really
boring
and
possibly
not
really
beer
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
petrus
chalice
hmmmm
ok
but
not
amazing
it
looks
pretty
good
and
the
smell
has
a
degree
of
depth
to
it
but
the
flavour
is
mostly
spice
the
body
is
also
rather
lacklustre
for
a
stronger
beer
the
problem
is
that
the
ginger
overwhelms
the
characteristics
of
the
original
beer
i
enjoy
old
tom
and
reckon
its
a
nicely
balanced
sipper
unfortunately
a
shedload
of
ginger
spoils
the
effect
its
got
more
to
it
than
most
ginger
beers
ive
tried
but
still
lacks
that
essential
ingredient
restraint
perhaps
i
just
dont
like
ginger
beers
all
that
much
anyway
worth
trying
but
only
ginger
lovers
will
appreciate
it
this
is
an
average
looking
chestnut
colored
beer
clear
low
carbonation
and
a
modest
lightly
tan
head
it
has
a
distinctive
ginger
aroma
like
a
vest
strong
ginger
ale
there
is
a
subtle
roasts
malt
smell
too
but
it
is
distant
behind
the
ginger
the
taste
however
is
great
pear
and
malt
come
through
immediately
followed
quickly
by
the
strong
spicy
ginger
flavor
sweet
sharp
spicy
the
flavors
work
well
to
complement
each
other
and
the
spice
of
the
ginger
hangs
around
ling
enough
to
give
a
very
pleasant
lingering
finish
medium
body
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
different
overall
this
is
a
weird
beer
for
which
i
award
it
points
but
one
which
doesnt
precisely
work
well
glad
i
had
it
absolutely
however
i
dont
think
ill
be
reaching
for
another
one
anytime
soon
if
you
are
really
into
ginger
however
it
may
be
worth
a
try
finishing
up
the
tom
trilogy
with
the
ginger
version
it
pours
a
clear
ambertawny
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
light
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
ginger
as
though
twere
straightup
canada
dry
or
something
light
white
pepper
a
pinch
of
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
honeydripped
green
apple
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
honeyapple
coming
through
a
bit
more
powerfully
still
the
star
of
the
show
is
the
spicy
ginger
character
though
that
is
partially
undermined
by
the
fruit
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mildly
slick
feel
overall
a
nice
little
ginger
beer
but
i
feel
its
depressed
by
the
pear
juice
which
itself
never
really
comes
through
as
pear
per
se
to
me
feel
s
nice
firm
o
interesting
but
i
do
not
think
i
will
get
this
beer
again
the
ginger
was
overpowering
ginger
old
tom
is
an
interesting
brew
though
not
something
of
which
i
would
drink
significant
quantities
as
i
scan
their
website
i
noticed
that
they
have
several
hints
toward
and
videos
of
cooking
recipes
featuring
their
ales
this
i
think
would
be
an
excellent
use
of
such
a
beer
and
would
likely
produce
more
lauding
words
than
im
offering
here
of
the
beer
itself
that
being
said
i
am
very
interested
in
tasting
the
original
old
tom
without
pear
and
ginger
which
i
feel
would
be
a
very
tasty
treat
indeed
the
bottle
claims
that
the
ginger
old
tom
is
made
with
the
worlds
best
ale
how
could
i
refuse
a
claim
so
bold
nice
dark
copper
color
thin
cap
of
cream
colored
head
solid
ring
of
retained
head
scent
brings
strong
ginger
and
peppery
spice
notes
of
tart
underrippened
pear
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
light
caramel
taste
is
full
on
ginger
ranging
from
pickled
ginger
to
ginger
ale
strong
and
burning
unrippened
pear
and
apple
brown
sugar
and
caramel
ginger
snap
cookies
medium
bodied
prickly
carbonation
lingering
sweetness
and
ginger
most
ginger
brews
ive
sampled
are
light
and
refreshing
this
is
strong
flavored
and
near
offensive
i
really
liked
this
one
the
nose
was
of
ginger
and
pear
with
a
slight
aroma
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
ginger
throughout
with
a
note
of
pear
and
citrus
there
is
also
some
underlying
sweetness
with
a
spicy
ginger
finish
not
something
id
drink
alot
of
but
i
would
drink
it
if
it
were
to
become
available
to
me
drinkability
very
interesting
for
a
change
but
certainly
not
a
session
beer
poured
into
an
arrogant
bastard
ale
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
to
dark
ruby
amber
one
finger
offwhite
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
dominated
by
ginger
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
detectable
rich
flavor
of
fresh
ginger
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruit
finishes
sweet
and
gingery
with
a
bit
of
a
lingering
earthy
flavor
from
the
ginger
thick
almost
syrupy
bodied
i
think
this
could
have
been
too
cloying
but
the
heavy
malt
body
supports
the
strong
flavors
well
definitely
only
for
ginger
lovers
but
im
one
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
revisit
o
this
beer
is
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
really
like
ginger
because
it
is
packed
with
flavors
and
doesnt
have
anything
quite
like
the
level
of
sweetness
you
get
in
ginger
ale
soda
ginger
tom
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
ginger
and
a
touch
of
caramel
this
is
a
very
rich
flavored
sweet
and
gingery
beer
full
body
with
sweet
gingerbread
maltiness
the
ginger
really
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
throat
drinkability
is
moderate
on
this
one
overall
quite
unique
and
fun
to
try
but
make
sure
you
like
ginger
before
you
think
about
trying
it
flavours
are
pretty
unpleasant
in
comparison
with
astringent
and
sharp
herbal
notes
dominating
lots
of
ginger
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
malt
and
body
to
carry
the
massive
strength
of
the
ginger
pours
copperbrown
beer
with
good
tan
head
leaving
nice
laces
clear
ginger
aroma
fullbodied
taste
of
very
spicy
ginger
and
some
dark
fruits
high
carbonation
and
very
warm
ginger
aftertaste
definitely
beer
for
ginger
fans
however
i
dislike
ginger
but
loved
this
beer
drinkability
a
bit
too
much
ginger
for
my
taste
i
prefer
the
old
tom
overall
unique
brew
if
you
love
ginger
you
love
this
beer
a
point
for
improvement
could
be
to
add
a
little
less
ginger
though
either
way
still
fun
and
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
well
it
is
what
it
is
if
you
like
ginger
go
for
it
but
its
a
tad
one
dimensional
if
you
like
ginger
beer
this
is
a
beer
for
you
yes
a
strong
ale
but
mostly
a
spiked
ginger
beer
pours
light
coloured
body
with
significant
white
foam
ginger
aroma
and
its
the
real
thing
taste
is
a
tad
below
median
taste
is
fine
for
a
fruitvegatable
style
as
a
fan
i
found
it
had
good
drinkability
it
pours
as
a
deep
chestnut
brown
which
is
quite
clear
and
had
a
light
carbonation
the
head
is
a
fast
fading
small
creamy
offwhite
there
is
as
expected
aromas
of
ginger
much
more
like
ginger
nut
biscuits
rather
than
pure
ginger
there
is
a
slight
acidic
lemon
hint
which
sits
beside
a
very
clear
pepperiness
and
warm
herbal
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
a
weird
pepper
flavour
following
the
aftertaste
is
dominated
by
the
ginger
with
a
warming
feel
on
the
tongue
not
my
sort
of
beer
the
flavours
seem
a
bit
confused
and
the
feel
is
a
bit
astringent
much
prefer
the
original
old
tom
this
really
is
the
quintessential
christmas
brew
screw
all
the
others
of
hearty
richness
this
is
a
gingerbread
man
in
a
bottle
md
the
level
of
carbonation
comes
restrained
and
pleasant
carrying
through
the
flavour
and
rich
body
skilfully
the
ginger
ale
doesnt
seem
to
tarnish
the
overall
performance
on
the
palate
but
certainly
give
an
imbalanced
impression
on
the
nose
worth
a
try
if
its
brewed
again
d
if
you
like
ginger
beer
then
i
feel
that
you
may
love
this
but
as
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
although
i
do
not
dislike
it
so
it
was
just
okay
for
me
other
comments
an
interesting
concoction
when
i
bought
it
i
thought
it
was
old
tom
brewed
with
ginger
but
its
actually
old
tom
blended
with
a
ginger
beer
that
would
account
for
the
lower
abv
i
guess
overall
a
decent
enough
combination
not
something
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
well
worth
a
try
an
interesting
and
overall
very
enjoyable
strong
ale
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
tannins
and
phenolics
in
the
flavor
although
it
doesnt
detract
from
things
very
much
a
dark
malt
and
alcohol
focused
beer
without
any
heavyhanded
residual
sugars
or
excessive
booziness
the
body
is
a
little
bit
on
the
weak
side
but
shouldnt
matter
to
most
folks
as
the
appeal
to
the
other
senses
is
solid
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
i
could
try
aging
the
booziness
out
of
this
beer
but
dont
see
the
point
im
confident
there
are
superior
offerings
out
there
enjoyable
strong
ale
that
does
not
hide
its
alcohol
way
better
than
chocolate
old
tom
excellent
ale
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
it
had
a
better
price
point
oh
well
champagne
tastes
and
a
beer
budget
overall
this
beer
came
right
out
of
nowhere
and
made
my
night
it
is
always
a
relief
to
find
good
beers
in
okinawa
this
being
a
classic
no
less
overall
4
25
excellent
beer
big
balanced
and
no
hint
at
all
of
its
8
abv
smooth
delicious
and
just
an
excellent
ale
this
baby
may
very
well
be
the
best
of
its
kind
in
the
world
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
scottish
ale
what
with
its
deep
malt
obsession
but
it
does
have
the
english
interest
in
hops
about
it
as
well
this
beer
was
a
revelation
to
me
certainly
one
i
had
not
heard
of
before
but
certainly
one
i
will
buy
again
this
time
in
bulk
highly
recommended
o
fandamntastic
is
this
what
a
latterday
burton
ale
tasted
like
ive
found
few
british
imports
here
in
the
states
that
have
tasted
quite
like
this
cant
help
but
pick
up
another
bottle
all
old
ale
should
taste
like
this
old
tom
is
a
classic
a
genuine
no
frills
english
ale
of
the
highest
class
underrated
as
they
get
this
is
everything
we
think
about
when
we
envision
old
world
english
evenings
turning
into
late
nights
and
as
claystation
phrased
it
so
eloquently
one
sip
and
you
expect
to
be
visited
by
the
ghosts
of
christmas
past
present
and
future
all
at
once
its
got
just
enough
dark
malt
roast
without
being
bitter
like
darker
ales
rich
enough
without
being
sweet
at
all
even
dry
in
fact
and
hefty
while
still
being
sturdy
yet
sessionable
its
winter
beer
for
me
i
think
but
its
not
that
confined
the
combination
of
grain
and
yeast
in
this
is
impressive
i
dont
wish
for
anything
else
a
great
balance
between
dark
and
light
as
well
as
strong
and
approachable
are
on
display
here
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
on
the
market
at
about
five
bucks
a
bottle
it
is
an
overwhelming
success
and
a
fantastic
example
of
what
true
english
old
ale
should
taste
like
and
feel
like
a
blue
collar
treat
overall
above
average
to
good
beer
seems
fairly
true
to
a
style
that
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
ill
have
to
track
down
a
bracia
to
get
a
firmer
idea
of
the
english
strong
ale
definitely
worth
a
shot
as
i
can
see
this
beer
having
fans
o
3

this
is
a
good
old
ale
but
not
the
best
by
far
the
american
made
ones
are
more
smooth
w
less
booze
taste
like
bells
third
coast
old
ale
and
double
dba
overall
watch
out
this
has
an
unpleasant
heat
to
the
booziness
on
the
back
thats
not
matched
by
enough
flavour
to
give
it
structure
or
purpose
by
the
end
i
felt
a
little
bit
battered
this
is
so
good
so
malty
cool
calm
and
utterly
lovely
my
goodness
i
like
this
more
and
more
as
i
drink
it
down
im
practically
in
love
with
it
mmmm
o
a
well
done
oddly
likeable
beer
definitely
tasty
and
drinkable
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
molasses
and
slight
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dark
fruit
toffee
and
alcohol
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
slightly
strong
and
boozy
drank
from
a
snifter
an
average
beer
if
truth
be
told
i
did
enjoy
it
but
they
alcohol
was
a
little
strong
and
although
pleasant
the
sweetness
and
fruity
flavours
did
little
to
mask
it
the
beer
is
a
strong
and
boozy
one
that
leaves
you
with
a
warming
alcohol
taste
to
it
and
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
despite
the
alcohol
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
incredible
if
it
is
not
world
class
it
has
to
be
close
i
do
find
it
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
little
bit
high
on
the
alcohol
but
that
is
part
of
the
story
of
this
beer
it
is
an
attractive
looking
smelling
and
tasting
beer
that
is
not
hoppy
and
i
am
going
to
give
it
a
solid
4
out
of
5
well
done
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
and
recommend
it
to
others

even
out

to

warmer
and
the

combined
with
the

too

to
be

very
much
down
by

not
really
what
im
looking

mineralalcoholdry
havent
had
a

black

taste
brings
in

with
a
hint
of
tobacco
and
some
extra
pepper
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate

and
a

overall
a
very
nice

one
certainly
worth
revisiting

occasions

the

isnt
to
amp
up
or
overwhelm
but
to
satisfy
not
everyone
loves
traditional

this
is

not

i
like
a
beer
that
appears
interesting
and
then
surprises
with
an
unusual
flavor
profile
and
this
does
both
nice
ale
that
i
will
return
to
i
also
enjoyed
the
chocolate
and
ginger
versions
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
wellbalanced
ale
although
a
bit
expensive
o
this
is
a
great
english
beer
the
dryness
makes
it
really
dangerously
drinkable
a
modern
classic
as
ive
read
and
heard
about
this
beer
from
the
late
legendary
michael
jackson
but
never
had
a
chance
to
try
it
glad
i
came
upon
it
today
o
although
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
its
quite
drinkable
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
and
it
isnt
heavy
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
fullbodied
it
has
a
rich
malt
flavor
that
cuts
through
with
some
nice
fruit
flavors
and
a
bit
of
metallic
flavor
a
boozy
one
for
sure
but
with
the
complexity
of
flavor
it
really
comes
off
as
some
sort
of
delicious
malt
liqueur
could
use
a
little
more
fruitiness
on
the
palate
but
the
nose
is
stellar
o
a
good
ale
but
world
best
as
the
camra
claims
i
liked
this
but
could
have
liked
it
more
needs
some
lingering
flavors
even
though
the
complexity
is
there
flawed
but
good
and
worth
trying
o
interesting
different
definitely
try
it
its
good
but
im
not
in
love
disappointed
by
this
excessive
booze
rawness
that
pretty
well
fails
to
integrate
with
the
rich
malt
and
dark
fruit
character
similar
to
but
a
pallid
imitation
of
a
decent
scotch
or
old
ale
o
a
nice
barleywine
that
probably
will
evolve
nicely
in
my
beercellar
lucky
me
who
bought
a
whole

it

old
ale
cheers
think
charlie
sheen
would
like
this
having
said
that
its
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
one
had
a
year
or
two
to
mellow
and
is
still
harsh
which
combined
with
a
lacking
body
undermines
any
flavors
here

after
the
beer
warmed
up
the
coffeesmell
of

came
in
my
nose
pleasant
smell
and
good
taste
this
was
a
surprise
for
me
a
rather
accessible
barley
wine
this
is
certainly
not
worth
considering
as
a
barleywine
it
lacks
both
the
potency
and
depth
in
the
mouth
to
be
however
as
a
soothing
and
just
delicious
old
ale
i
think
it
sets
the
standard
smooth
and
lush
malts
meet
sticky
fruits
and
wide
custard
flavors
in
a
harmonious
and
masterfully
crafted
beer
awesome

strong
english

whos
alcoholic
warmth
soothes
the
chest
a
lovely
sipping
ale
to
have
at
hand
a
good
nightcap
dsupremely
enjoyable
on
its
own
account
could
potentially
be
even
better
with
so
mild
cheeses
or
some
savory
fruits
served
from
a
330ml

i

pours
a
rich
russet
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
that
soon
dropped
to
a
collar
nice
sweet
aroma
with
strong
notes
of
raisins
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruit
and
sherry
the
flavour
follows
up
with
the
same
elements
but
has
the
added
bonus
of
some
decent
hopping
and
a
nice
combination
of
flavours
in
a
way
it
felt
like
a
cross
between
a
barleywine
and
a
pale
ale
medium
body
and
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
quite
well
done
while
not
as
rich
and
heavy
as
some
of
the
others
we
had
i
think
this
may
well
have
been
one
of
the
most
drinkable
bottles
we
popped
which
surprised
me
after
the
disappointing
chocolate
tom
d
a
decent
drinker
overall
i
found
this
an
excellent
beer
it
was
to
me
a
belgian
strong
ale
reminding
me
of
goudon
carolus
or
even
chimay
blue
or
unibroues
maudite
it
was
not
quite
at
the
level
of
the
three
i
mention
but
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
creamy
i
could
have
it
again
but
i
am
disappointed
since
this
should
be
labelled
a
stron
barley
porter
so
you
would
know
what
to
expect
despite
the
relatively
high
abv
this
is
a
much
more
drinkable
ale
than
other
barleywines
ive
tried
there
isnt
the
strong
taste
of
alcohol
like
there
is
with
some
other
strong
ales
the
smaller
size
bottle
makes
it
easier
as
well
very
interesting
indeed
md
medium
carbonation
and
a
bit
harsh
going
down
would
have
loved
it
to
be
a
bit
smoother
and
easier
drinking
but
hey
this
is
a
barley
wine
so
i
should
stop
my
whining
a
good
example
of
this
style
but
not
really
a
style
of
beer
i
like
the
treacle
taste
is
a
bit
too
dominant
for
my
liking
and
it
is
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
does
look
lovely
and
the
smell
is
quite
intriguing
surprisingly
excellent
head
sandy
white
airy
and
smooth
with
great
retention
body
is
thick
coffee
brown
with
sparks
of
bright
redorange
lovely
nose
with
plenty
of
caramel
chocolate
raisins
and
vinous
dark
fruits
plus
a
honeybiscuit
note
reminiscent
of
graham
crackers
flavor
is
big
on
prunes
black
tea
caramel
and
dark
rum
although
the
alcohol
is
wellintegrated
not
exactly
hidden
spicy
but
not
too
hot
or
medicinal
cola
and
oaky
red
wine
round
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
balancing
act
its
mediumbodied
lush
but
also
quite
dry
it
could
be
richer
but
that
might
make
this
too
sweet
overall
this
is
very
nice
almost
belgian
in
character
fruity
spice
drinkable
and
complex
this
beer
falls
into
the
category
of
brews
that
id
wanted
to
try
for
a
very
long
time
id
read
about
the
beer
years
ago
but
never
found
a
bottle
until
coming
across
it
in
a
great
beer
shop
in
italy
the
beer
pours
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
firm
and
soapy
head
the
foam
is
densely
packed
and
a
chocolatetan
color
with
lots
of
stayingpower
the
aroma
is
solidly
good
vinous
with
plenty
of
oak
and
malt
theres
also
a
touch
of
vanilla
caramel
and
boozeinfused
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
complex
and
mildly
sweet
balance
drinkability
and
subtle
flavor
nuances
are
the
key
to
this
beer
its
quintessentially
english
in
style
not
the
inyourface
american
strong
ale
this
suits
the
beer
perfectly
smooth
and
complex
the
beer
is
a
real
joy
the
carbonation
was
a
little
more
pronounced
than
expected
but
it
fit
nicely
with
the
brew
very
enjoyable

a

by

the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
the
robinson

would
recommend
this
as
a
barley
wine
for
those
who
have
not
tried
the

presented
to
the

d

i
would
take
a
harviestoun
old

oil
over
this
any
day
its
just
too
thin
for
my
tastes
actually
reminds
me
of
a
poor
doppelbock
other
comments
this
sample
was
nearly
a
year
old
still
seems
quite
fresh
and
hasnt
changed
much
from
the
first
review
ill
have
to
let
the
third
bottle
sit
until
beyond
the
bestby
date
jun
2007
to
possibly
see
some
more
drastic
changes
d
compared
with
my
previous
note
of
this
beer
on
draught
it
seems
that
the
bottled
version
shows
less
alcoholic
warmth
and
also
less
explicit
fruity
elements
but
betterbalanced
slightly
lighterbodied
than
expected
this
beer
just
punches
above
its
weight
and
makes
a
really
smooth
yet
complex
digestive
instead
of
a
glass
of
port
to
round
off
my
xmas
celebration
wonder
how
itd
taste
if
bottleconditioned
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
a
try
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
though
old
tom
is
not
a
good
barleywine
no
matter
its
country
of
origin
it
may
have
originated
from
a
handwritten
recipe
from
1899
but
this
is
one
instance
where
historical
accuracy
should
take
a
backseat
to
common
sense
this
kitty
could
stand
to
replace
a
large
portion
of
its
soft
purr
with
a
snarling
lions
roar
a
pretty
brown
beer
with
a
nice
head
but
alas
nut
much
going
on
below
the
surface
very
smooth
and
somewhat
malty
this
beer
is
too
subdued
in
the
flavour
profile
to
being
highly
regarded
i
sensed
the
quality
but
could
not
really
grasp
the
nuances
as
they
were
too
far
down
in
the
mix
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
was
a
good
beer
up
until
the
point
that
i
took
a
drink
thanks
to
tavernjef
for
mail
this
one
to
me
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
for
myself
a
fine
ale
for
those
grim
cold
winter
nights
this
beer
is
hard
to
choke
down
after
half
a
bottle
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
and
thats
all
it
gets
a
nice
strong
ale
i
was
happy
to
find
this
on
cask
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
from
the
same
people
who
brought
us
double
maxim
brown
ale
s
couldnt
pass
this
up
at
only
1
99
a
bottle
strange
cat
on
label
and
what
appears
to
be
a
reference
to
capital
brewery
on
the
neck
label
the
appearance
was
pretty
weak
with
a
resemblence
to
flat
pepsi
the
aroma
is
pretty
malty
with
chocolate
and
sugar
undertones
pretty
uneventful
for
a
barleywine
as
far
as
taste
goes
not
as
explosive
as
i
hope
barleywines
are
decent
for
a
onetime
tasting
but
not
impressive
alright
i
dont
know
what
the
deal
with
this
beer
is
but
i
was
completely
not
impressed
this
beer
had
a
skunkish
kind
of
rotten
smell
it
poured
a
really
dark
amber
color
small
head
was
present
the
taste
is
all
malts
not
enough
hop
balance
i
even
like
my
barley
wines
to
be
more
on
the
malty
side
but
this
is
just
too
one
sided
not
recommended
big
malty
caramel
head
dark
dried
fruit
leather
and
burnt
oranges
bitterness
though
not
present
on
the
initial
palate
shows
well
on
the
after
taste
this
lacks
the
depth
of
malt
flavor
that
old
nick
has
for
some
reason
this
seems
to
be
the
barley
wine
of
choice
here
in
osaka
give
me
an
old
foghorn
or
old
nick
any
time
feels
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
rich
and
fullflavored
its
smooth
through
and
the
carbonation
is
at
the
right
level
one
of
these
is
enough
however
deep
crimson
hue
with
excellent
clarity
light
beige
soapy
head
yields
sparse
lace
mellow
ripe
fig
and
dark
caramel

in
aroma
with
a
splash
of
cocoa
trace
black
licorice
and
earthy
hop
hints
tame
and
clean
aromawise
prevalent
in
flavor
are
notes
of
toffee
drizzled
biscuit
and
prune
mild
hints
of
bakers
chocolate
and
woody
almost
oaky
hop
tones
add
a
bittersweet
contrast
mid
palate
nutty
burnt
almond
hints
lend
a
trace
astringency
late
lightly
bittered
but
well
attenuated
with
only
moderate
residual
sweetness
thinnish
in
body
with
a
mouthfeel
shy
in
viscosity
to
support
the
malt
profile
finishes
with
a
snap
of
singed
chocolate
cookie
hints
and
a
lingering
woody
sweet
fuggles
twang
a
rather
understated
but
well
rounded
strong
ale
thats
somewhat
dangerous
in
its
softness
subtle
and
rather
tasty
lovely
soft
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
carbonation
level
is
just
right
whisks
away
the
malt
in
preparation
for
the
next
sip
very
nice
barley
wine
that
doesnt
go
over
the
top
in
any
way
perilously
drinkable
for
what
it
is
this
strong
ale
poured
a
dark
ruby
and
was
very
clear
head
was
thin
and
airy
and
slightly
off
white
very
strong
alcoholic
aroma
sweet
malts
evident
some
stewed
fruit
was
in
the
taste
profile
very
malty
and
powerful
a
sipping
ale
seemed
stronger
than
it
probably
was
after
a
steady
diet
of
bitter
dark
burgandy
with
a
light
tan
ring
that
forms
a
circle
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
along
the
lines
of
raisins
or
prunes
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
slight
carbonation
flavor
seems
less
complex
than
i
expected
malt
and
the
aforementioned
fruit
flavors
seem
to
dominate
the
palate
even
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
and
you
never
really
taste
it
finish
contains
flavors
of
prune
and
is
somewhat
vinous
not
overly
complex
but
very
smooth
drinking
if
there
ever
was
a
barley
wine
to
ease
someone
into
the
style
without
bombarding
them
with
hops
like
some
american
brewers
tend
to
do
or
scaring
them
alway
with
a
noticably
high
tasting
level
of
alcohol
old
tom
might
be
the
one
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
especially
for
the
large
alcohol
content
of
an
old
ale
mostly
medicinal
taste
with
yeasty
and
sweet
cherry
tones
i
keep
expecting
more
flavor
from
the
beer
but
all
im
left
with
is
the
yeasty
aftertaste
which
isnt
bad
but
not
what
i
hoped
for
comes
in
a
9
3
oz
bottle
nice
deep
dark
russet
brown
color
with
deep
ruby
red
tones
and
highlights
crowned
with
a
tall
loose
tannish
head
that
faded
pretty
darn
quick
and
the
lace
is
very
minimal
in
spots
that
evaporate
smell
has
a
soft
caramel
malty
front
notes
lend
bits
of
fruity
darkness
of
cherry
plum
prune
and
raisin
and
a
little
covering
of
alcohol
a
simple
yet
divine
little
nose
nothing
potent
here
besides
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
thats
a
little
hard
to
get
past
taste
is
mellowing
caramel
malts
mostly
with
a
few
notes
of
darker
fruits
of
plum
and
raisin
a
slight
burnt
quality
adds
and
sweetens
more
towards
the
finish
hops
barely
detectable
something
associated
with
most
bws
from
across
the
pond
this
brew
is
uk
all
the
way
and
is
a
fine
specimen
for
a
calmer
toned
down
version
of
most
us
versions
its
mellowness
and
tamer
qualities
are
nice
but
not
something
i
was
wanting
feel
is
touch
on
the
thin
side
with
some
boldness
and
small
girth
towards
the
finish
where
the
malts
lay
a
nice
little
lingering
burntness
of
chewy
caramel
and
sweetness
nice
solid

a
pretty
nice

a

they
list
this

it

this

to

a

my

taste

sweet
a
load
of
maltiness
dark

some
nuttiness
tastes
like
a
port
somewhat
i
bet
this
would
go
great
with
a
big
thick
maduro
robusto
cigar
as
a
beer
its
not
bad
by
itself
i
think
there
are
better
old
ales
out
there
but
i
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
thanks
for
effort
cokes
this
is
pretty
decent
and
distinctively
british
just
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
barleywine
good
roasted
flavor
and
decent
winter
brew
this
was
like
an
ipa
with
a
big
thick
sticktoyerribs
maltiness
a
good
combo
for
a
cold
winters
day
which
it
was
when
i
drank
this
well
done
this
beer
drinks
a
lot
easier
than
7
abv
with
a
good
balance
of
semisweet
malts
and
tongue
biting
bitterness
it
doesnt
lose
your
interest
one
way
i
would
describe
this
beer
is
like
fat
tire
on
steroids
and
with
much
more
bittering
hops
to
pair
recommended
o
very
unique
and
tasty
winter
drinker
still
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
sockeye
is
doing
a
good
job
o
english
strong
ale
eh
tastes
pretty
damn
close
to
an
ipa
or
a
hoppy
red
or
something
either
way
its
very
tasty
nice
hop
strength
and
variety
flavorful
and
drinkable
awesome
overall
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
beer
it
lacks
a
punch
or
a
standout
feature
you
keep
sipping
looking
for
more
but
there
just
isnt
anything
else
to
make
this
memorable
in
any
way
a
very
drinkable
english
strong
ale
as
i
would
have
no
idea
this
is
7abv
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
would
be
better
served
in
a
4
or
6
pack
at
a
lower
price
point
and
would
be
much
more
popular
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
to
full
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
seemingly
creamy
in
the
feel
this
is
farily
easy
drinking
with
a
low
alcohol
impact
for
7
much
more
toasty
than
any
brew
i
have
had
recently
that
was
a
welcomed
surprise
perhaps
a
bit
more
depth
to
the
malt
would
be
encouraged
but
overall
not
bad
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
medium
dark
looking
beer
with
an
off
white
12
head
that
fizzled
down
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
pronounced
and
hinted
of
sweetness
and
malts
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
i
did
not
detect
the
spices
associated
with
many
winter
style
beers
but
a
great
blend
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
nice
sweetness
caramel
perhaps
i
will
be
returning
for
more
this
warm
glow
is
a
welcome
accompaniment
to
a
hearty
stew
on
a
frosty
northwestern
intermountain
night
edit
note
second
tasting
much
better
carmel
and
butter
played
in
their
tonight
really
liked
it
pours
a
hazy
burgundy
with
a
12
offwhite
head
smell
is
chocolate
pumpernickel
some
faint
earthy
hops
a
touch
of
roast
malt
overall
quiet
but
pleasant
hops
are
much
more
present
in
the
flavor
with
some
cascadecentennialstyle
piney
notes
the
hops
are
balanced
by
either
a
high
crystal
or
chocolate
malt
but
the
beer
is
not
particularly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
present
without
being
sticky
or
syrupy
in
any
way
highly
drinkable
but
has
a
little
bit
of
winter
spice
taste
is
reealllyy
creamy
this
is
immediately
one
of
the
better
winter
ales
i
have
tried
a
great
malt
character
here
or
i
could
have
sprung
for
another
bottle
but
i
can
always
go
back
tomorrow
sockeye
is
a
really
good
brewpub
and
the
only
one
in
the
boise
area
that
does
any
sort
of
experimentation
cheers
fellas
and
keep
up
the
good
work

taste
leaves
some
bitterness
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
although
its
not
a
hoppy
sort
of
bitter
i
find
it
heavy
and
malty
lots
of
flavor
if
there
is
molasses
sweetness
i
cant
find
it
it
goes
down
easily
enough
but
id
rather
be
drinking
the
fu
sandy
or
the
redfish
or
the
abbe
dubbel
or
a
schlitz
excellent
beer
would
drink
it
again
aroma
is
grainy
malt
and
some
bready
yeast
with
hits
of
caramel
and
a
little
earthy
hops
first
sip
is
fairly
mild
with
an
almost
bland
flavor
only
some
sweet
malt
and
a
little
brownsugar
the
body
is
thin
with
mild
rolling
carbonation
average
texture
the
flavor
lingers
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
cereal
grain
i
dont
get
too
much
of
a
hop
profile
and
the
booze
is
well
hidden
at
7
5
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
is
a
let
down
as
i
was
hoping
for
more
when
i
bought
the
bottle
in
new
jersey
i
wouldnt
pay
for
another
bottle
if
i
saw
one
enjoyable
but
huge
booziness
a
fairly
average
strong
ale
very
yeasty
and
slightly
sweet
but
lacking
in
malt
flavours
and
aroma
i
guess
id
expect
the
style
to
have
a
darker
and
more
distinct
malt
character
no
aromatic
hops
and
the
bitterness
is
dry
and
harsh
there
are
certainly
better
beers
out
there
give
it
a
miss
m
the
ending
is
the
best
part
because
it
last
really
long
it
is
very
bitter
at
the
end
and
can
be
felt
in
the
back
part
of
the
mouth
d
im
not
sure
this
beer
is
categorized
correctly
to
me
its
a
very
good
quality
epa
whatever
it
is
this
beer
is
a
very
solid
brew
dr
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
if
i
were
a
fan
of
the
style
id
have
another
its
not
horribly
ambitious
but
what
it
tries
to
do
it
does
well
500
ml
bottle
pours
nicely
into
my
300
ml
pint
glass
minimal
head
leads
to
some
lacing
in
glass
nice
dark
golden
colour
smell
is
not
overly
assaulting
to
the
senses
i
was
hoping
for
more
piney
citrusy
sensation
taste
is
average
once
again
not
as
hoppy
as
anticipated
just
a
mild
sensation
of
hops
very
mild
malts
and
some
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
finecertainly
more
desirable
to
an
american
macrobeer
from
the
big
three
i
would
try
again
but
there
are
other
strong
pale
ales
that
would
end
up
in
my
cart
first
d
if
this
was
available
on
tap
id
be
ordering
this
often
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
as
a
nice
session
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
its
refreshing
flavorful
and
is
easy
to
drink
would
go
excellent
with
pub
food
i
recommend
trying
this
one
out
i
liked
it
better
than
pedigree
and
will
probably
buy
it
again
quite
smooth
for
a
fairly
well
carbonated
beer
the
hops
only
become
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
and
then
only
with
significant
concentration
otherwise
there
is
a
pleasant
but
unremarkable
caramel
tinged
malt
domination
d
i
didnt
have
to
pour
it
down
the
sink
but
im
not
heading
back
to
the
store
for
another
one
either
overall
its
a
lot
more
drinkeable
than
you
might
expect
for
a
6
2abv
beer
clean
and
tasty
given
the
abv
very
drinkable
if
you
get
some
fresh
bottles
which
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
no
clear
bottle
skunk
here
not
a
bad
drink
at
all
but
not
something
ill
be
impressing
any
friends
with
i
have
a
feeling
the
6
2
might
come
back
to
hurt
me
later
overall
pleasant
strong
ale
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
as
a
preponderant
feature
i
liked
the
bitterness
of
this
one
not
outstanding
but
quite
an
enjoyable
experience
nevertheless
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
on
draughtcask
pours
a
medium
copper
exceptionally
clear
and
with
obvious
effervescent
carbonation
rising
in
abundance
a
fairly
bright
white
head
that
builds
to
about
two
fingers
before
subsiding
gradually
to
a
nice
thick
covering
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
which
leaves
decent
lacing
smell
is
just
a
touch
off
caramel
obvious
and
a
bit
of
butter
slight
hops
a
bit
of
light
fruits
taste
is
fuller
lots
of
malts
with
some
noticeable
alcohol
slight
hop
bitterness
nothing
to
write
home
about
mouthfeel
is
very
well
carbonated
full
bodied
and
very
pleasing
drinkability
is
quite
good
pretty
average
but
they
need
to
lose
the
clear
bottles
50
cl
bottle
pretty
copper
colour
not
much
foam
and
fades
very
quickly
the
usual
sulphur
limestone
aroma
that
can
be
found
later
in
the
mouth
too
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
fruits
medium
to
light
body
taste
besides
the
sulphur
is
fruity
pine
some
honey
and
a
bit
of
cookies
md
with
a
lively
mouthfeel
throughout
this
is
a
reasonable
not
particularly
strong
english
beer
in
need
of
a
more
assertive
character
here
and
there
not
complex
enough
for
a
6
2abv
strong
ale
and
the
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
dare
i
say
that
this
is
a
story
to
english
bitter
a
strong
malty
lager
to
pilsnerthat
is
missing
the
delicate
elements
while
not
being
bold
and
satisfying
enough
wont
buy
it
again
unless
its
on
sale
nice
deep
amber
colour
as
visible
through
the
clear
bottle
smell
is
a
flat
malty
smell
with
a
bit
of
hops
to
it
nothing
spectacular
flavour
malt
with
a
tad
of
hop
bitterness
and
an
underlying
sweetness
nothing
overwhelmingly
amazing
but
still
a
somewhat
unique
taste
i
find
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
tingly
but
not
terrible
alcohol
content
limits
the
drinkability
somewhat
this
is
quite
a
pint
to
put
away
other
comments
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
last
beer
i
reviewed
fullers
golden
promise
and
the
skunkiness
didnt
help
its
case
clear
bottles
are
inexcusable
clear
500ml
bottle
this
strong
ale
looks
somewhat
orange
in
tbe
bottle
in
the
glass
it
is
a
very
attractive
peachnectarine
colour
transparent
and
rich
in
appearance
i
had
to
pour
fairly
vigorously
to
get
the
head
a
decent
size
but
when
it
stopped
churning
at
about
1
cm
it
was
creamy
with
some
patches
and
holes
in
the
foam
cream
coloured
with
fine
slow
lacing
left
on
the
glass
delicious
english
hops
sweet
bread
and
caramel
at
first
in
the
nose
i
can
never
seem
to
get
enough
of
these
butterscotchgoldings
or
fuggles
combinations
a
lovely
hit
of
buttery
roasted
malt
just
sweet
enough
to
balance
the
spicy
vinous
hop
a
respectable
balance
raisins
and
cream
definite
vanilla
sourish
green
hop
freshness
and
roasted
nuts
the
flavour
is
all
malt
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
the
hops
make
their
dryness
quite
early
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
following
through
to
the
finish
where
it
is
all
bitter
yet
the
malt
can
still
be
detected
equally
and
the
whole
flavour
though
favouring
the
hops
is
exceptionally
balanced
caramel
some
spiciness
raisins
maple
syrup
dry
bread
lactosed
malt
in
the
finish
a
very
tasty
english
pale
but
not
as
complex
as
some
mouthfeel
is
a
perfect
carbonation
and
very
full
easy
to
quaff
cold
day
or
hot
a
respectable
beer
which
i
would
definitely
buy
again
500ml
bottle
sampled
from
a
guinness
glass
pours
with
amber
clear
colour
with
no
significant
head
retention
there
is
a
malty
sour
mash
nose
with
almost
metallic
notes
the
taste
comes
on
slow
with
the
3m
attack
malt
sour
mash
and
hints
of
maple
developing
into
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
astringency
and
a
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
the
aftertaste
is
again
in
the
sour
maltmash
vein
which
is
quite
nice
for
a
while
but
evolves
into
bitterness
after
not
too
long
overall
its
not
bad
and
has
reasonable
drinkability
but
sadly
enough
i
wouldnt
put
it
much
above
something
like
kokanee
gold
i
suppose
this
ones
just
not
for
me
this
is
the
same
colour
as
pedigree
but
the
tastes
are
very
different
the
bitterness
is
higher
and
so
is
the
taste
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
i
wished
for
more
hops
but
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
given
the
choice
though
i
would
drink
the
pedigree
as
it
offers
a
more
multifaceted
set
of
flavours
at
a
lower
alcohol
pours
out
thin
a
clear
medium
copper
hue
with
minimal
head
metallic
grains
hit
the
nose
first
some
caramel
malt
surfacing
behind
them
and
then
some
herbal
hops
behind
that
curious
combination
of
boozy
sweet
malt
accompanied
by
a
dry
husky
texture
on
the
initial
flavour
where
it
flattens
out
to
a
smoother
boozy
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
finish
and
the
hops
make
a
tardy
appearance
well
into
the
aftertaste
not
much
of
a
balancing
act
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
average
a
bit
watery
for
a
6
2
abv
ale
after
half
of
a
glass
it
is
not
sitting
very
well
with
me
a
pass
on
this
one
next
time
a
fairly
good
ale
tasty
nice
to
look
at
but
id
imagine
tough
for
some
folks
to
get
past
their
nose
drinkablilty
very
enjoyable
beer
this
could
be
had
on
a

awesome
this
is
the
beer
that
i
compare
all
other
bourbon
aged
beers
to
good
bourbon
beer
you
can
smell
the
bourbon
taste
is
smooth
and
not
overpowering
taste
is
smooth
easy
and
just
right
amount
of
bourbon
not
a
good
tasting
beer
delicious
beer
more
mellow
and
refreshing
flavor
than
expected
from
an
8
2
abv
nice
bourbon
and
caramel
notes
love
bourbon
flavor
and
high
alcohol
concentration
the
best
bourbon
ale
ive
ever
tasted
that
caramelly
almost
burnt
sweet
flavor
of
the
bourbon
thats
the
strong
flavor
here
quite
a
boozy
tasting
beer
not
much
head
clear
golden
color
very
nice
smell
of
bourbon
the
taste
has
quite
a
bit
of
bourbon
too
very
enjoyable
excellent
overall
strong
yet
smooth
highly
recommended
my
favorite
but
a
little
expensive
good
strong
ale
with
a
hint
of
bourbon
flavor
and
smell
a
smooth
crisp
beer
with
a
subtle
scent
and
taste
of
bourbon
perfectly
carbonated
bursting
with
flavor
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
very
flavorful
beer
lots
of
aroma
going
on
wood
barrel
taste
also
sip
dont
slam
or
youll
be
on
the
floor
after
2
or
3
glasses
yummy
good
beer
to
marinate
steak
tips
in
mild
hint
of
bourbon
not
over
powering
so
smooth
must
be
drank
out
of
a
glass
for
aromas
really
have
to
have
a
taste
for
the
brown
liquor
store
enjoy
these
new
beer
plus
blends
being
a
fan
of
innis
and
gunn

i
thought
id
try
this
and
whiskey
and
scotch
beer
blends
not
for
me
kills
all
bourban
barrel
beers
interesting
crazy
but
there
was
a
cool
tap
handle
pretty
good
interesting
bourbon
flavor
its
a
good
tasteing
beer
with
a
burbon
tasteing
aftertaste
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
strong
bourbon
smell
and
taste
and
light
after
taste
enjoyable
on
occasion
but
not
an
every
day
beer
despite
the
lightness
of
its
feel
overall
a
4
5
for
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
alltechs
lexington
brewing
and
distilling
co
i
will
purchase
this
beer
regularly
just
because
it
says
bourbon
barrel
doesnt
mean
its
good
definitely
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
really
not
a
great
beer
probably
the
worst
bourbon
barrel
beer
i
have
had
along
with
bluegrass
bourbon
barrel
stout
bad
stuff
this
was
a
weird
beer
it
was
creamy
on
the
tongue
and
sweeter
than
i
would
have
expected
i
got
little
hints
of
bourbon
at
first
sniff
but
afterwards
i
really
only
got
sweet
and
random
side
note
it
was
also
one
of
the
most
carbonated
bottles
of
beer
ive
ever
had
it
really
wanted
out
of
that
bottle
since
when
do
they
make
a
barrel
aged
budweiser
this
is
just
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
a
classic
ale
with
light
bourbon
aging
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
an
easy
drinking
ale
with
some
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
from
the
barrel
o
not
a
beer
id
drink
again
weak
flavors
and
body
not
a
big
fan
a
great
tasting
beer
very
enjoyable
i
actually
cant
taste
a
lot
of
bourbon
in
this
but
the
beer
is
extremely
good
regardless
tasted
like
a
crappy
mass
produced
lager
with
no
barrel
present
at
all
if
theres
a
bba
bud
light
clone
this
is
it
a
mix
of
my
two
favorite
things
beer
and
bourbon
you
can
taste
the
the
carmel
flavor
from
the
ole
barrels
and
it
has
a
wonderful
smooth
finish
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
a
bourbon
barrel
beer
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
great
taste
and
aroma
i
love
beer
and
i
love
bourbon
a
drink
just
doesnt
get
any
better
then
this
it
has
potential
nice
bourbon
notes
but
thin
in
mouthfeel
and
flavor
terrible
beer
cloudy
no
head
no
carbonation
i
poured
it
out
their
stout
was
slightly
better
c
smoke
is
way
too
overpowering
overall
pretty
mediocre
but
surprisingly
good
considering
the
price
i
was
expecting
much
worse
considering
the
rating
for
this
beer
i
taste
absolutely
zero
bourbon
notes
in
this
brew
i
honestly
dont
know
how
they
get
away
with
calling
this
bourbon
barrel
ale
i
may
get
another
one
of
these
and
age
it
for
some
time
it
seams
like
one
of
those
beers
that
will
get
much
better
with
a
little
aging
will
update
if
i
do
p
s
drink
it
warmer
and
slower
than
you
normally
would
i
didnt
even
finish
the
beer
i
barely
got
the
bourbon
aroma
out
of
it
i
couldnt
identify
the
initial
taste
but
the
finish
was
acidic
to
me
the
palate
was
watery
this
beer
is
better
for
the
age
in
my
opinion
my
brother
described
his
single
swallow
as
stiff
but
good
he
prefers
coors
light
but
i
agree
it
seemed
more
harsh
back
in
august
its
definitely
more
mellow
now
a
bit
less
char
and
id
have
given
it
even
higher
marks
an
exceptional
ale
with
a
considerable
oakiness
and
subdued
vanilla
note
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
but
not
overpowered
and
has
a
nice
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
i
truly
loved
this
4
pack
i
need
to
find
more
o
2
50
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
bourbon
barrel
beers
this
is
no
exception
this
one
is
not
very
well
executed
or
this
is
a
bad
bottle
it
is
one
dimensional
with
a
rubbing
alcohol
like
bourbon
taste
it
is
not
a
drain
pour
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
or
drink
again
awful
a
weakflavored
although
highalcohol
light
beer
with
strong
bourbon
overtones
maybe
they
just
made
a
light
beer
and
then
poured
in
the
bourbon
poured
this
in
an
8oz
cordial
glass
color
good
smell
was
ok
a
bit
too
bitter
in
the
aroma
taste
was
sharp
on
the
whiskey
and
flat
on
the
ale
a
bit
over
powering
with
the
bourbon
taste
tastes
like
a
bourbon
i
wouldnt
buy
an
excellent
example
of
a
bourbon
ale
but
beyond
its
excellence
it
is
not
particularly
imaginative
could
be
the
best
beer
deal
ever
i
picked
up
a
growler
of
this
for
4
99
at
wine
and
beyond
in
sherwood
park
this
ale
poured
nicely
with
a
reasonable
amount
of
head
that
disappeared
fairly
quickly
not
surprising
for
a
draft
growler
that
has
been
sitting
for
a
couple
of
days
the
bourbon
flavour
is
just
enough
to
give
this
ale
a
very
unique
and
pleasant
taste
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
kick
and
goes
down
very
nicely
the
combination
of
great
taste
and
killer
deal
make
this
a
highlight
reel
brew
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
bourbon
note
very
tasty
beer
and
i
would
definitely
buy
again
though
a
nice
bourbon
aged
ale
not
the
best
but
certainly
worthy
a
really
great
bourbon
ale
great
bourbon
finish
very
nice
taste
golden
with
a
fairly
decent
head
but
virtually
no
lacing
from
the
mostly
white
foam
nose
was
mostly
bourbon
not
much
else
peeking
through
tasted
pretty
nice
for
a
short
moment
as
the
hints
of
vanilla
oak
and
caramel
came
across
for
just
the
tiniest
instant
before
they
dropped
out
leaving
only
a
thin
remnant
of
tannins
had
this
on
draft
at
a
restaurant
it
was
excellent
ordered
a
second
glass
still
excellent
saw
it
on
the
shelf
of
the
local
packie
and
had
to
try
it
wow
what
a
180
nowhere
near
as
enjoyable
in
the
bottle
as
it
was
on
draft
i
will
not
buy
this
in
bottles
again
only
draft
never
had
such
a
drastic
disparity
in
taste
between
bottle
and
draft
being
a
local
brewery
i
bought
this
to
support
them
glad
i
did
good
ale
this
is
quick
a
nice
find
and
a
really
great
tasting
ale
the
aromas
and
flavors
really
do
this
beer
justice
dont
pass
it
up
one
word
butterscotch
i
wish
this
would
have
been
aged
more
than
6
weeks
too
sweet
and
not
enough
heat
to
meet
my
expectations
for
this
beer
its
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
pours
an
even
transparent
amber
a
soft
slightly
offwhite
cap
lingers
for
a
few
moments
before
retreating
to
a
thin
cover
that
remains
sloppy
patches
of
lacing
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
mug
big
smells
from
the
oak
barrel
slightly
floral
with
lots
of
vanilla
coming
through
this
is
gentle
on
the
tongue
with
a
light
creamy
touch
when
swished
around
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
but
shows
on
the
finish
vanilla
and
bread
crust
malts
up
front
bourbon
is
slightly
muted
by
a
lightly
bitter
hop
presence
again
sweet
notes
of
alcohol
and
oak
hang
on
the
pallet
until
the
next
sip
this
seems
to
be
very
drinkable
at
first
the
abv
seems
to
be
the
only
hindrance
as
the
flavors
are
never
overwhelming
or
unappreciated
solid
bourbon
ale
a
delicious
ale
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
like
the
name
says
bourbon
ale
pours
a
medium
brown
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
very
heavy
on
both
wood
and
bourbon
to
the
point
where
i
cant
smell
anything
else
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
coming
in
the
beginning
and
being
taken
over
by
the
bourbon
flavors
it
was
very
tasty
although
onedimensional
soft
smooth
smoky
and
sweet
if
you
enjoy
bourbon
and
beer
you
are
living
the
dream
with
this
one
i
had
recently
discovered
bourbon
barrel
aged
brews
at
the
yards
brewery
in
philadelphia
pa
seems
to
be
made
just
for
me
this
kentucky
brew
is
a
wonderful
tasting
beer
the
ale
is
light
and
flavorful
with
the
the
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
coming
thru
to
please
it
is
smooth
and
has
no
bad
after
taste
its
like
a
cocktail
for
real
men
try
it
not
a
fan
of
bourbon
ales
good
but
i
wont
try
again
there
was
alcohol
here
but
not
in
the
taste
and
only
when
i
polished
this
off
could
i
fell
it
subtly
kick
in
while
not
a
complete
letdown
this
beer
had
so
much
potential
to
it
but
proverbially
fell
flat
not
as
complex
as
a
true
bourbon
barrel
beer
this
is
what
id
give
someone
who
never
had
anything
of
this
sort
before
too
light
for
a
style
that
can
get
as
heavy
as
can
be
worth
a
go
once
for
for
those
who
cant
get
a
hold
of
anything
from
innis
and
gunn
o
interesting
but
more
like
a
beer
cocktail
than
a
beer
3
trying
this
out
next
week
look
forward
to
it
medium
body
and
carbonation
smooth
clear
cooper
with
white
head
about
34
inch
excellent
smell
with
vanilla
oak
bourbon
nose
pleasantly
drinkable
with
slight
alcohol
bite
blends
well
with
steak
and
sautéed
mushrooms
and
onions
overall
this
is
a
much
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
nice
malt
notes
nicely
balanced
with
toffee
and
caramel
and
the
bourbon
overtones
very
nice
id
certainly
drink
it
again
i
wouldnt
flush
it
from
the
bomb
shelter
stores
but
i
would
question
why
space
was
allotted
to
this
particular
brew
2
915
it
has
understandable
appeal
its
just
not
my
bag
baby
while
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
its
hard
to
argue
about
the
quality
this
stuff
is
exquisitely
smooth
and
is
one
of
the
most
amazing
mixing
beers
ive
found
combined
with
a
vanilla
porter
for
example
you
have
a
very
amazing
combination
outstanding
overall
i
think
this
is
a
gimmicky
attempt
to
attract
the
crossover
high
end
spirit
crowd
i
am
glad
that
i
purchased
this
as
a
single
it
just
isnt
my
thing
i
guess
again
some
of
the
positives
are
the
aroma
and
appearanceit
is
definitely
an
eye
grabber
for
the
initial
aroma
and
color
i
think
there
are
better
english
strong
ales
out
there
i
gave
it
the
mark
i
did
based
largely
on
appearance
aroma
and
effort
probably
wont
be
trying
again
o
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
mess
all
around
it
simply
wasnt
pushed
far
enough
therefore
it
was
a
thin
brew
huge
smell
of
oak
which
was
exciting
but
that
was
about
it
has
a
bright
clear
copper
color
mouthfeel
was
medium
high
carbonation
and
the
taste
was
bright
but
odd
the
high
carbonation
hurt
the
bourbon
flavors
both
beers
i
have
tried
from
this
brewer
were
disappointing
looked
good
smelled
good
fell
short
overall
and
excellent
after
dinner
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
only
one
or
two
and
to
leisurely
sip
it
tasted
fruity
banana
not
as
bourbon
like
as
it
was
last
time
i
tried
it
did
they
start
diluting
this
down
wonder
what
percent
of
the
beer
i
drank
was
ever
in
a
barrel
overall
bourbon
barreled
budwiser
yeah
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
better
no
head
on
this
one
hazy
copper
body
nose
is
of
bourbon
and
rotten
funk
with
some
vanilla
taste
is
malty
not
very
hoppy
bourbon
and
metallic
im
just
not
feeling
this
one
mouthfeel
is
ok
large
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
decent
enough
to
buy
enough
but
id
drink
it
again
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
finish
toffee
candy
with
a
light
bourbon
taste
this
beer
is
all
bourbon
and
oak
from
start
to
finish
pours
amber
with
absolutely
no
head
aroma
is
nice
and
oaky
soft
bourbon
presence
vanilla
and
a
tease
of
some
toffee
aroma
is
nice
but
i
wish
it
could
have
had
a
touch
more
depth
to
allow
it
to
be
great
nails
the
bourbon
and
barrel
influence
lacks
enough
beer
presence
flavor
is
toasty
and
spiceyy
with
oak
vanilla
toffee
and
a
soft
bourbon
presence
a
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
far
surpassed
my
expectations
i
always
saw
this
one
on
tap
at
the
craft
bars
in
colorado
but
always
passed
on
it
for
whatever
reason
i
assumed
it
was
a
dud
now
that
i
am
living
in
kentucky
and
found
singles
of
it
on
the
local
shelves
figured
id
give
it
shot
certainly
glad
i
did
decent
stuff
o
this
wasnt
the
beer
i
was
planning
on
having
at
the
pub
but
im
glad
its
the
one
that
landed
on
my
coaster
ill
be
grabbing
some
for
the
beer
fridge
o
maybe
this
beer
had
been
built
up
too
much
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
this
bba
ale
pours
a
handsome
deep
copper
color
with
very
little
head
but
decent
film
and
legs
the
aroma
is
a
rich
blend
of
vanilla
oak
leather
and
nice
warm
booze
the
flavor
is
just
as
rich
and
delicious
there
is
alot
of
bourbon
here
and
alcohol
heat
its
actually
surprisingly
hot
given
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
thick
n
sticky
in
the
best
way
i
love
this
but
i
also
love
bourbon
if
you
dont
then
youre
gonna
hate
this
if
you
do
do
yourself
a
favor
and
drink
this
at
room
temperature
practically
all
barrel
lacking
depth
something
i
would
order
if
i
wanted
a
bourbon
but
for
some
reason
couldnt
get
one
o
a
poor
mans
bba
asa
i
would
not
buy
it
again
but
its
not
awful
this
is
a
delicious
brew
i
am
a
big
fan
of
bourbon
and
the
taste
is
excellent
this
a
beer
that
you
want
to
take
your
time
and
enjoy
its
rich
flavor
i
stumbled
upon
it
and
will
most
likely
be
drinking
it
again
you
do
not
need
to
be
a
big
fan
of
bourbon
to
enjoy
this
beers
big
flavor
you
will
either
love
this
beer
or
hate
it
with
every
fiber
in
your
body
its
like
cilantro
in
that
aspect
it
pours
with
no
head
normally
id
be
wary
then
you
smell
it
what
is
this
then
you
sip
it
and
it
just
makes
sense
oak
vanilla
then
you
end
up
sculling
it
im
in
california
now
and
cant
get
it
and
i
feel
like
a
crackhead
i
love
ipas
and
almost
drink
them
exclusivley
but
this
was
my
go
to
when
i
needed
a
break
now
she
has
been
taken
from
me
most
bourbon
barrel
beers
are
stouts
that
overpower
the
oak
and
vanilla
with
coffee
and
chocolate
you
owe
yourself
to
try
this
ale
if
you
hate
it
send
it
to
me
and
ill
take
it
down
for
you
adam
from
tipped
mixology
o
wonderful
take
on
a
bourbon
barrel
idea
well
worth
looking
for
eh
not
so
great
not
terrible
this
is
clearly
a
novelty
beer
the
whiskey
taste
definitely
jumps
out
at
you
and
is
not
subtle
its
more
whiskey
than
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
sipping
but
i
would
never
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
should
note
that
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
whiskey
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
alcohol
bite
hits
you
early
but
it
changes
its
character
as
you
drink
over
all
its
a
nice
beer
that
i
wouldnt
think
twice
about
sipping
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
solid
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
typical
bourbon
stouts
although
i
truly
love
a
bourbon
stout
too
this
would
make
an
excellent
4th
course
in
a
5course
beer
dinner
especially
with
a
nice
steak
dish
overall
the
bourbon
gives
it
a
very
nice
taste
and
aroma
but
the
mouthfeel
is
significantly
lacking
it
wouldve
made
all
the
difference
o
its
slightly
better
than
their
bourbon
stout
enjoyable
nice
to
find
at
an
airport
definitely
a
sipper
o
i
can
appreciate
the
attempt
with
this
ale
and
i
can
understand
how
others
may
enjoy
it
but
this
was
not
for
me
i
could
have
likely
found
the
same
amount
of
pleasure
in
cracking
open
a
macro
and
giving
it
a
splash
of
my
old
mans
jameson
the
taste
is
a
more
promising
with
its
sweet
malty
notes
and
vague
bourbon
notes
but
nothing
extraordinary
just
a
generally
sweet
beer
but
dont
think
youre
getting
a
good
dose
of
bourbon
or
other
liquor
when
you
have
it
maybe
it
is
meant
to
be
subtle
o
its
got
a
nice
smooth
taste
but
the
flavor
isnt
as
bold
as
i
might
have
been
hoping
for
its
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
type
the
flavors
arent
assertive
and
theyre
kind
of
mundane
in
that
they
dont
blow
you
away
still
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
despite
the
grainy
feel
and
has
a
nice
abv
level
you
could
certainly
do
worse
o
i
like
this
one
because
the
bourbon
flavors
seem
to
work
with
the
beer
not
fight
it
its
not
like
simply
pouring
some
bourbon
into
a
beer
as
the
flavors
seem
well
intertwined
with
each
other
if
you
go
for
this
type
of
beer
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
not
a
big
beer
drinker
because
you
havent
found
one
you
like
i
recommend
trying
this
one
this
beer
has
all
of
the
typical
characteristics
of
an
english
strong
ale
without
any
depth
at
all
its
fairly
true
to
the
style
with
a
strong
malty
backbonebooziness
and
light
english
hops
it
fails
to
deliver
any
depth
and
and
is
fairly
one
note
especially
for
a
beer
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
pretty
good
ale
with
a
nice
bourbon
flavor
and
feel
goes
down
easy
and
is
something
i
will
probably
look
for
again
pours
a
nice
one
and
a
half
inch
head
and
a
nice
amber
color
no
lacing
on
the
glass
has
a
sweet
bourbon
smell
that
reminds
me
of
guess
what
bourbon
initial
sip
is
first
bourbon
and
then
you
get
the
beer
feel
tastes
like
guess
what
bourbon
i
ended
up
sipping
this
like
a
neat
bourbon
thats
how
bourbon
like
this
thing
tastes
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
if
you
like
bourbon
you
will
like
this
beer
they
seem
to
hit
the
bourbon
flavor
straight
on
but
as
a
beer
theres
not
much
imo
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
or
heartiness
overall
i
gave
this
beer
a
3
00
because
while
the
appearance
and
smell
are
fantastic
however
the
mouthfeel
and
short
finish
leave
both
ale
and
bourbon
lovers
wanting
more
really
shines
ontap
prominent
bourbon
aroma
almost
sweet
to
the
nose
little
to
no
head
served
in
a
snifter
the
ale
itself
is
nothing
robust
or
impressive
it
is
a
simple
vehicle
with
wich
to
deliver
the
oakiness
leached
bourbon
essences
not
one
i
reccomend
enjoying
all
the
time
but
really
nice
as
an
occasional
treat
enjoy
id
suggest
this
beer
to
a
friend
this
feels
like
a
dead
barleywine
mixed
with
flat
root
beer
its
not
horrid
to
drink
but
strangely
doesnt
remind
me
of
beer
let
alone
a
barrel
aged
one
the
only
thing
i
would
say
is
the
weak
watery
body
makes
it
super
easy
to
drink
but
my
desire
to
ever
want
to
have
this
again
is
virtually
nil
sorry
to
be
harsh
but
im
used
to
serious
bba
beers
with
a
year
in
the
barrel
like
central
waters
or
bcbs
or
founders
kbs
or
hoppin
frog
ba
boris
somehow
alltechs
lexington
feels
it
is
respectable
to
barrel
age
for
only
six
weeks
which
is
what
they
state
on
their
website
this
brew
is
a
copper
colored
mostly
clear
brew
the
head
is
white
with
some
intricate
lace
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
maltforward
and
clean
aroma
some
grain
the
taste
is
sweet
and
a
really
notable
wood
character
comes
out
woody
some
boozy
components
from
the
bourbon
and
a
bit
of
complexity
it
has
the
impression
of
dryness
from
all
of
the
wood
notes
mediumfull
and
relatively
smooth
in
body
a
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
for
the
type
will
seek
this
out
again
if
you
want
bourbon
drink
bourbon
o
a
nice
surprise
definitely
an
after
dinner
sipper
perhaps
with
a
cigar
more
like
a
bourbon
than
a
beer
smooth
fairly
rich
and
it
only
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
abv
hides
well
but
there
is
a
warming
aspect
that
develops
as
it
warms
up
stopping
short
of
becoming
cloying
i
highly
recommend
this
one
too
much
vanilla
for
my
liking
the
malt
backbone
is
nice
and
oak
provides
good
dryness
the
fruity
notes
are
somewhat
offputting
overall
an
amazing
beer
in
my
eyes
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
without
a
problem
im
a
lover
of
bourbon
so
thats
definitely
a
reason
why
but
why
would
you
even
try
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
bourbon
o
decent
brew
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
altech
please
read
this
and
revisit
your
lexington
brewery
it
seems
to
me
your
quality
control
is
very
lacking
and
lately
i
get
more
bad
batches
than
excellent
batches
i
understand
the
need
to
meet
demand
but
if
it
makes
a
stellar
beer
okay
you
are
not
doing
anyone
any
favors
o
good
for
what
it
is
think
i
still
prefer
beer
that
tastes
more
like
beer
but
it
is
a
unique
experience
to
have
a
beer
that
tastes
like
weak
bourbon
maybe
this
will
grow
on
me
though
i
loved
innis
gunn
rum
cask
aged
beer
from
the
gitgo
and
still
enjoy
it
now
and
then
but
unlike
innis
gunn
i
get
the
impression
there
is
not
much
substance
here
beyond
the
bourbon
flavor
and
aroma
still
that
flavor
is
seductive
so
ill
probably
buy
more
of
this
o
not
super
not
bad
somewhere
in
between
but
the
idea
of
this
ale
is
greater
than
what
it
actually
is
which
is
unfortunate
o
beer
is
overly
thin
and
overly
bourbonlike
without
any
beer
backbone
to
hold
it
up
o
pretty
meh
for
something
thats
been
in
a
bourbon
barrel
i
was
just
expecting
more
flavor
but
the
base
beer
is
too
thin
and
bland
to
really
hold
up
against
or
complement
a
more
substantial
bourbon
flavor
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
that
is
isnt
a
hot
mess
ive
been
more
or
less
disenchanted
with
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
over
the
last
year
and
i
really
just
bought
this
out
of
mild
curiosity
the
base
beer
is
pretty
mild
but
so
is
the
barrel
aging
this
is
far
from
a
big
burly
barrelaged
stout
and
im
sure
thats
why
some
would
scorn
at
this
but
i
think
its
worth
a
try
definitely
an
interesting
brew
its
a
great
beer
to
try
when
you
want
something
different
had
this
beer
about
3
years
ago
and
couldnt
remember
what
it
was
called
so
i
looked
it
up
the
beer
itself
was
really
good
and
has
a
nice
strong
flavor
the
color
was
rich
and
smelled
great
i
am
not
much
of
a
whiskey
can
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
first
had
kbba
on
tap
at
the
wedding
rehearsal
dinner
of
my
daughter
and
soninlaw
three
years
ago
only
recently
realized
its
marketed
in
bottles
as
well
pretty
strong
bourbony
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
kick
from
a
higher
alcohol
content
despite
its
boldness
kbba
goes
down
pretty
smooth
with
no
noticeable
aftertaste
ive
got
a
feeling
you
either
really
like
this
sort
of
thing
or
you
really
dont
count
me
in
o
id
pass
on
this
one
next
time
unfortunately
while
smooth
it
is
a
bit
too
lightly
carbonated
and
thins
out
slightly
toward
the
end
i
liked
the
previous
ones
better
no
idea
what
brand
barrel
they
used
or
if
that
is
even
true
a
well
done
beer
drink
this
fresh
for
a
nice
bourbon
beer
experience
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
beverage
doom
by
founders
is
the
best
bourbon
barrel
ive
ever
had
and
this
does
not
compare
this
beer
is
not
that
balanced
in
my
opinion
the
booziness
alcoholic
flavors
dominate
on
this
i
am
not
a
very
big
fan
i
would
not
buy
this
again
i
just
wanted
to
try
it
and
now
i
regret
buying
it
i
had
to
dump
it
in
the
sink
its
a
toasted
gold
ale
with
just
a
ring
of
soapy
white
foam
smells
of
applesauce
rich
peach
and
booze
some
caramelized
sugars
and
a
bit
of
an
immature
oak
taste
is
sweet
vanilla
nougat
and
more
sweetness
really
one
dimensional
medium
bodied
with
lighter
carb
and
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
completely
random
buy
and
completely
satisfied
in
parting
kbb
is
the
best
american
brew
ive
tasted
in
years
theres
a
revolution
going
on
here
and
im
glad
im
along
for
the
ride
pour
is
clear
orange
with
reddish
hues
and
a
creamy
bubbly
off
white
head
nose
is
interesting
heavy
bourbon
with
strong
vanilla
notes
and
wood
undertones
off
chocolate
malt
notes
and
some
charred
barrel
in
back
taste
is
heavy
wooded
bourbon
and
chocolate
malt
fair
amount
of
vanilla
behind
the
flavors
but
finish
is
a
bit
empty
thinned
out
body
in
back
with
strong
carbonation
making
an
odd
combo
fair
amount
of
running
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
somehow
not
hot
very
different
beer
d
this
one
goes
down
smoothly
but
if
you
arent
a
fan
of
bourbon
you
will
not
enjoy
this
i
would
call
this
a
cheap
bourbon
alternative
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
that
makes
it
interesting
either
plenty
of
better
beers
on
the
shelves
overall
truly
unique
had
whiskeybourbon
barrel
aged
beers
before
but
never
one
that
picked
up
this
much
whiskey
flavor
certainly
worth
trying
but
couldnt
see
myself
regularly
sipping
on
this
one
when
reaching
for
a
beer
would
go
well
on
a
cold
night
in
the
mountains
around
a
hunting
camp
fire
o
this
was
a
well
balanced
beer
but
not
overly
complex
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
an
ok
beer
very
satisfying
in
the
middle
of
the
mountains
overall
a
decent
barrel
aged
brew
good
smooth
whiskey
taste
the
base
beer
could
of
had
some
more
substance
but
it
went
well
with
the
barrel
overall
a
decent
beer
pros
its
drinkable
pretty
flavorful
and
definitely
has
a
heavy
bourbon
character
cons
onedimensional
and
a
little
too
bourbon
forward
overall
its
not
offensive
and
would
be
a
good
intro
to
bourbon
barrel
beers
give
it
a
go
if
you
can
pickup
a
single
the
taste
was
sweet
something
i
dont
know
what
exactly
i
didnt
taste
vanilla
maybe
it
was
caramel
but
it
didnt
strike
me
that
way
it
was
drinkable
not
cloying
but
not
very
exciting
overall
a
nice
package
overall
really
nice
flavor
but
not
terribly
complex
not
that
it
claims
or
needs
to
be
i
would
get
it
again
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
very
little
head
there
is
a
nice
oaky
aroma
with
hints
of
scotch
the
taste
had
a
strong
oak
like
barrel
flavor
with
strong
hints
of
scotch
like
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
and
good
full
flavor
overall
a
found
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
great
beer
definate
try
i
wouldnt
advise
consuming
many
due
to
the
alcohol
content
not
a
beer
for
a
new
beer
drinker
but
one
that
could
sway
some
to
the
light
of
good
beer
choices
this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
and
certainly
was
far
better
than
the
ba
score
would
have
led
me
to
believe
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
hue
and
a
solid
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
a
woody
and
buttery
with
a
distinct
bourbon
smell
flavor
is
bitter
from
the
bourbon
treatment
balanced
with
a
hearty
malt
and
buttery
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
the
taste
is
very
creamy
silky
milky
lactose
and
strong
coconut
i
lost
the
actual
bourbon
flavor
that
i
expected
the
feel
ended
with
a
bourbon
aftertaste
and
hints
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
but
overall
this
is
a
quality
tasting
ale
over
all
a
very
enjoy
able
ale
if
you
like
bourbon
also
you
would
be
please
to
try
this
beer
i
know
i
will
again
allaround
poor
beer
rereview
after
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
odd
sweetness
is
likely
due
to
the
oakbourbon
aging
duh
on
my
part
it
still
tastes
a
bit
odd
to
me
though
overall
a
painfully
flawed
beer
no
doubt
from
short
cuts
in
the
brewing
process
o
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
sweet
malty
and
quite
drinkable
as
a
stand
alone
quaff
definitely
not
recommended
wont
try
it
again
you
can
pass
on
this
one
with
no
remorse
its
not
offensive
but
i
dont
think
ill
make
it
through
the
bottle
its
just
not
worth
it
an
okay
change
of
pace
but
couldntwouldnt
make
a
steady
diet
of
it
cheers
o
boy
this
is
a
beer
thats
completely
all
over
the
place
its
got
such
a
big
bourbony
nose
but
falls
flat
on
the
flavor
its
thin
and
watered
down
and
the
color
is
weird
how
is
this
a
viable
beer
to
produce
did
we
all
just
get
punkd
what
is
this
world
coming
to
still
reading
yes
thanks
and
please
also
understand
that
i
quite
like
bourbon
thus
i
would
recommend
if
you
dont
then
i
would
stay
away
otherwise
its
good
stuff
overall
certainly
a
must
try
daily
drinker
no
way
i
could
never
see
that
happening
great
stuff
to
keep
on
hand
when
you
feel
like
it
and
possibly
would
like
to
share
something
a
little
different
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
o
after
just
having
had
their
kentucky
ale
and
bourbon
barrel
stout
i
am
quite
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
better
this
is
nice
combination
of
aroma
flavor
and
feel
easy
to
sip
but
not
too
heavy
on
the
abv
ill
have
this
again
if
you
like
bourbon
or
flavored
beer
its
worth
a
try
o
an
interesting
beer
that
i
would
have
again
somewhat
lacking
in
complexity
but
still
tasty
overall
a
sweet
nottoobad
strong
ale
just
a
bit
butterscotchy
for
me
a
decent
maltforward
englishstyle
ale
awash
in
beginners
bourbon
barrel
character
thats
all
fine
and
good
and
tasty
enough
to
be
a
means
to
an
end
however
for
me
to
actually
desire
another
there
needs
to
be
something
in
the
way
of
balance
to
the
well
varied
sweetness
oh
and
as
for
this
brewers
origins
i
apologize
for
intimating
that
they
are
in
the
same
league
as
world
brews
o
glad
i
got
to
try
it
for
free
not
saying
it
is
bad
its
just
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
barrel
aged
beer
this
is
definitely
something
different
and
new
to
me
i
would
pick
up
a
bottle
as
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
could
lover
or
hate
this
is
a
bourbon
beer
through
and
through
literally
tastes
like
someone
dropped
a
shot
of
bourbon
or
whiskey
into
a
malty
ale
if
bourbon
is
your
thing
youll
love
this
i
guess
its
okay
if
youre
looking
to
drink
bourbon
but
if
thats
the
case
just
drink
bourbon
poured
12oz
into
a
dogfish
snifter
pours
light
copper
orange
small
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
no
lacing
as
you
drink
smell
is
oak
vanilla
scotch
alelike
malts
taste
hits
quickly
with
sweet
vanilla
oaky
bourbon
dark
fruits
not
hoppy
at
all
not
too
malty
either
ive
never
had
the
unbarrelled
version
but
id
imagine
its
not
too
special
this
is
pretty
one
dimensional
you
get
the
flavors
you
expect
with
no
surprises
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
either
i
would
pair
this
friend
with
something
southern
maybe
bobby
bare
the
moon
was
blue
had
on
tap
at
the
grey
goose
in
lexington
ky
poured
into
a
snifter
very
attractive
clear
bourbon
color
no
head
at
all
but
thats
likely
due
to
the
care
the
bartender
took
in
pouring
the
beer
some
oaky
vanilla
on
the
nose
but
its
so
very
delicate
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
slick
wet
and
a
little
oily
the
flavor
consists
of
mild
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
it
falls
a
little
flat
but
otherwise
a
decent
beer
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
its
very
drinkable
and
the
smell
is
just
overflowing
with
complex
aromas
but
the
beer
base
cant
seem
to
hold
onto
them
and
you
just
get
a
semi
sweet
grainy
vanilla
beer
with
mild
bourbon
tones
not
bad
just
lacking
characteristics
that
would
make
it
great
the
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
notes
are
nice
but
the
base
beer
behind
that
just
cant
keep
up
bourbon
drinkers
ought
to
be
happy
with
this
the
overall
drinking
experience
is
easy
and
smooth
the
bourbon
barrel
flavor
dominates
everything
think
bourbon
chilled
mixed
with
seltzer
you
might
get
a
very
similar
thing
to
what
this
beer
is
nothing
else
is
particularly
noteworthy
about
this
brew
lots
of
wood
aged
stuff
on
the
market
come
on
guys
mouth
feel
really
its
a
beer
no
im
not
a
yellow
fizzy
beer
idiot
im
just
a
guy
who
loves
good
beer
beers
are
either
good
or
bad
only
by
personal
taste
this
one
however
wow
if
you
like
the
taste
of
vanilla
extract
this
is
the
beer
for
you
try
this
stuff
is
amazing
you
cant
go
wrong
here
try
it
write
your
one
review
oi
guess
i
would
go
along
with
the
people
calling
it
a
bourbon
bomb
in
a
duvel
glass
ive
got
to
say
i
was
excited
to
see
this
one
come
to
florida
ive
heard
about
it
being
an
unbalanced
bourbon
bomb
but
ive
enjoyed
other
beers
of
a
similar
nature
like
twisted
pines
reillys
oak
whiskey
red
so
im
hoping
this
one
will
be
to
my
liking
as
well
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
pours
much
lighter
than
i
expected
a
pretty
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
hits
right
away
with
vanilla
and
oak
with
sweet
malts
grains
and
a
distinct
boozy
note
the
taste
is
rather
remarkable
in
that
it
really
tastes
quite
like
a
bourbon
without
the
burn
not
a
great
bourbon
but
a
surely
passable
one
kinda
like
an
evan
williams
kind
of
thing
going
on
if
you
dig
its
got
vanilla
and
oak
from
the
barrel
as
well
very
unique
in
the
sheer
force
of
flavor
going
on
theres
absolutely

how
much
i
enjoyed
it

in

it
was
very

kbogacapr

good
variation
of
style
even
the
lost
ones
i
am
favoring
this
new
craft
of
using
old
bourbon
casksbarrels
to
enhance
beers
usually
this
crafty
enhancement
is
pronounced
on
the
sturdy
styles
of
beers
stouts
and
porters
this
particular
one
is
applied
on
a
what
could
be
categorized
as
a
brown
or
belgian
ale
style
the
amber
color
predicts
nothing
of
its
flavor
someone
mentioned
vanilla
oh
yeah
like
a
vanilla
womp
it
is
predicted
in
the
aroma
but
it
kicks
you
with
a
big
lil
abner
vanilla
boot
the
flavor
is
way
too
unusualy
present
in
the
beer
to
be
ignored
as
a
character
when
it
is
too
busy
banging
you
over
the
head
with
a
mallet
it
is
like
when
you
have
a
restaurant
chain
franchise
meal
and
notice
a
preservative
flavor
that
reminds
you
it
isnt
real
food
the
vanilla
masks
any
memory
of
bourbon
if
you
like
vanilla
coke
this
is
the
beer
for
you
the
beer
is
just
too
vanilla
for
me

slightly
below
average
for
me
presence
of
bourbon
is
just
too
overwhelming
and
it
was
way
too
sweet
i
would
not
recommend
it
taigornov
02
which
would
have
made
it
even
better
sykdococt
12
im
a
huge
bourbon
barrel
beer
fan
but
a
more
complex
malt
profile
would
make
this
a
much
better
beer
leaving
me
somewhat
disappointed
the
texture
is
definitely
irish
redenglish
pale
much
lighter
than
i
expected
for
a
barrel
aged
strong
ale
but
then
again
i
suppose
its
such
a
broad
style
that
it
could
still
be
appropriate
i
dont
know
carbonation
does
very
little
to
this
beer
as
it
just
sort
of
lays
flat
on
the
tongue
its
not
lively
and
bubbly
nor
is
is
mouthcoating
and
sticky
on
the
bright
side
its
a
very
easy
drinker
for
being
8
i
never
taste
even
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
the
aforementioned
light
body
gives
this
beer
the
potential
to
be
very
dangerous
all
in
all
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
despite
not
being
terribly
exciting
im
young
i
only
started
really
thinking
about
good
beer
three
years
ago
and
this
is
my
first
review
on
the
ba
so
feel
free
to
review
my
review
and
tell
me
how
i
did
i
welcome
criticism
and
advice
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
the
flavors
in
this
brew
expecting
more
from
the
malts
and
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
the
beer
seems
out
of
balance
which
is
a
shame
since
the
bourbon
barrels
have
obviously
added
a
tremendous
level
of
complexity
to
an
ale
that
doesnt
seem
quite
able
to
keep
up
all
the
familiar
characteristics
of
a
good
bourbon
hit
me
immediately
that
oakey
and
vanilla
scent
the
copper
color
it
drinks
like
the
smoothest
bourbon
youve
ever
had
with
that
unctuous
buttery
feel
going
down
and
a
hint
of
residual
warmth
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
is
delicious
smooth
and
has
an
aggressive
tricky
8
abv
the
smell
and
aroma
were
predominately
bourbon
i
enjoy
bourbon
and
this
was
an
enjoyable
experience
i
sensed
some
malt
sweetness
through
the
bourbon
but
not
much
this
is
a
rather
light
beer
altogether
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
like
drinking
a
lightly
carbonated
whiskey
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
overall
im
very
happy
with
this
beer
the
bourbon
is
the
strongest
flavor
perhaps
overpowering
the
other
flavors
of
the
ale
and
yet
what
does
one
really
expect
when
theyre
picking
up
something
called
bourbon
barrel
ale
adding
that
to
the
fact
that
bourbon
is
one
of
the
few
liquors
i
enjoy
drinking
and
you
end
up
with
a
beer
i
strongly
approve
of
great
taste
definitely
would
get
again
o
this
got
grosser
the
more
i
drank
it
perfect
example
of
a
bourbon
barrel
not
being
able
to
fix
a
crappy
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
barrelaged
beer
budweiser
would
make
od
its
something
id
definitely
try
again
pleasant
bourbon
flavor
that
doesnt
overpower
the
more
subtly
flavors
overall
this
beer
has
good
flavor
but
by
the
end
the
flavor
felt
a
bit
played
out
o
i
really
like
bourbon
so
i
enjoy
this
beer
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
bourbon
this
will
probably
not
sit
very
well
with
you
overall
a
good
beer
but
much
better
on
tap
due
to
the
increased
carbonation
mmmmm
im
not
sure
if
its
the
beer
or
my
uncontrollable
desire
for
bourbon
i
e
makers
mark
but
wow
this
beer
smells
good
i
must
admit
the
only
way
id
ever
drink
this
brew
is
on
tap
i
tried
it
once
from
a
bottle
and
it
tasted
like
moldy
cheese
totally
serious
if
you
like
bourbon
youd
probably
like
this
one
however
beware
in
the
words
of
a
famous
comedian
itll
get
ya
drunk
the
abv
is
high
i
mean
really
high
so
be
careful
because
it
tastes
good
and
you
might
want
a
few
also
its
extremely
expensive
which
may
drive
you
to
try
it
on
bottle
but
remember
itll
taste
like
poopy
cheese
so
with
all
that
said
break
the
bank
and
put
on
your
favorite
seersucker
suit
because
its
derby
day
and
youll
need
a
bourbon
ale
but
really
a
mint
julep
if
were
being
totally
honest
this
beer
is
a
trainwreck
a
huge
mess
of
butterscotch
and
booze
i
can
only
assume
that
the
bros
had
a
different
batch
than
this
one
feels
a
lot
like
a
marketing
beer
approach
to
barrelaged
beers
i
think
the
ab
winters
cask
is
better
than
this
overall
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
one
if
you
like
bourbon
you
will
probably
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
i
prefer
beers
with
a
hint
of
bourbon
not
a
smack
of
it
to
the
mouth
i
will
be
giving
out
the
rest
of
the
4pack
unfortunately
tasting
the
beer
you
will
be
strongly
introduced
to
those
sweet
bourbon
notes
in
the
middle
the
bourbon
is
still
dominant
but
some
malty
notes
are
present
at
the
end
i
only
can
guess
the
hint
of
some
hop
for
my
taste
the
bourbon
whiskey
flavors
are
just
to
much
and
powerful
i
see
no
balance
in
this
beer
and
would
not
buy
it
again
but
it
might
suit
others
d
slight
scotch
taste
but
overall
very
good
makes
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
and
goes
well
with
a
sugary
dessert
should
have
been
served
a
bit
warmer
to
let
the
bourbon
taste
and
smell
really
come
out
but
i
couldnt
help
myself
and
decided
to
drink
it
asap
good
stuff
id
have
another
for
sure
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
considering
i
would
have
never
tried
this
if
my
friend
did
not
bring
it
to
me
so
for
that
i
say
cheers
i
vacillated
between
liking
this
beer
and
loathing
it
it
has
some
nice
flavors
but
the
bourbon
portion
of
it
just
tasted
artificial
and
cheap
it
was
an
interesting
style
to
barrel
age
and
i
have
one
more
bottle
so
my
opinion
may
change
but
at
this
point
im
not
overly
impressed
pours
a
clear
bright
copper
in
color
small
ring
of
head
forms
and
recedes
away
aroma
is
full
of
vanilla
bourbon
butterscotch
and
alcohol
fumes
the
taste
follows
suit
but
does
so
nicely
there
is
a
sweetness
from
the
oaky
tannins
of
the
bourbon
barrels
vanilla
like
bourbon
flavor
makes
itself
known
with
a
vaguely
smokey
sweet
alcohol
grain
flavour
the
english
paleirish
red
base
beer
lends
itself
perfectly
in
its
lightness
to
pick
up
all
the
flavors
from
the
barrel
alcohol
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
really
highlights
what
fresh
bourbon
barrels
can
do
to
a
simple
base
ale
quite
nice
d
my
dream
is
that
someday
some
enterprising
fellows
will
come
along
and
make
trappiststyle
ale
with
crystal
malt
then
age
it
in
these
oak
barrels
on
that
day
thereon
i
will
drink
nothing
else
whatsoever
as
long
as
i
live
until
then
i
will
happily
drink
another
one
of
these
babies
whenever
i
happen
to
be
in
the
bluegrass
state
just
not
enough
beer
qualities
come
through
it
does
feature
bourbon
in
one
of
the
purest
ways
in
a
beer
o
this
is
more
or
less
a
light
version
of
a
bourbon
beer
the
most
interesting
aspect
is
the
huge
wave
of
vanilla
that
is
delayed
by
a
few
seconds
after
transition
i
had
this
on
tap
a
few
weeks
ago
and
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
not
a
bad
beer
could
be
sessionable
but
8
19
abv
is
a
bit
heavy
i
think
this
deserves
more
than
a
b
the
wood
and
whiskey
flavors
come
through
nicely
and
do
not
take
over
the
whole
flavor
a
nice
base
still
remains
after
aging
interesting
and
a
beer
that
i
had
a
lot
to
write
about
which
is
always
a
nice
thing
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
this
beer
has
benefitted
from
being
bourbon
barrel
aged
i
have
tried
the
original
a
beer
with
decent
complexity
i
would
like
to
serve
this
to
a
friend
who
drinks
nothing
but
cheap
whiskey
and
cheap
domestic
lager
and
see
if
he
digs
it
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
color
15
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
strong
bourbon
and
slight
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
strong
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
bourbon
slight
sweet
malt
and
slight
grain
overall
the
bourbon
was
overpowering
not
well
blended
in
either
aroma
or
body
medium
bodied
surprised
this
didnt
have
much
more
in
this
area
but
it
really
helps
with
the
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
a
little
different
for
the
style
but
enjoyable
pours
a

orange
colour
with
thin
white
head
not
too
much
lacing
head
dissipates
after
a
bit
smells
like
bourbon
vanilla
and
some
butter
a
lot
more
bourbon
in
the
smell
than
i
expected
but
i
guess
with
a
lighter
beer
than
typical
bourbon
barrel
aged
ones
it
makes
the
bourbon
stand
out
more
flavour
is
fairly
sweet
pretty
one
dimensionally
bourbon
smooth
mouth
feel
overall
there
are
so
many
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
out
there
i
would
be
fine
to
never
drink
this
again
the
beer
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
cannot
imagine
some
one
else
enjoying
it
this
has
a
nice
bourbon
flavor
but
i
think
it
may
be
a
tad
too
sweet
i
had
to
at
least
try
this
one
since
its
been
all
the
rage
in
indianapolis
for
the
past
couple
months
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
white
lacing
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
syrupy
artificial
bourbon
honey
and
vanilla
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
its
odd
and
wheres
the
bourbon
this
smells
fake
it
tastes
of
essentially
watered
down
bourbon
with
honey
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
flavors
are
too
mellow
and
blase
overall
why
are
people
going
crazy
about
this
the
bourbon
is
so
subtle
and
is
really
only
present
in
the
aftertaste
you
would
think
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
ale
would
be
able
to
give
off
more
bourbon
aromas
and
stronger
flavor
overall
this
beer
is
just
average
all
around
it
drinks
light
and
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
its
what
they
were
going
for
and
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
abv
or
attention
that
this
has
gotten
in
the
midwest
that
said
it
does
taste
good
i
actually
enjoyed
it
and
could
see
its
rightful
place
in
a
styrofoam
cooler
on
some
doublewides

if

in

but
it
is
also
a
one

because
of
the

of
the

bourbon
character
of
the
beer
as
an
example
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
illustrates
well
that
such
aging
need
not
be
restricted
to
stouts
and
barleywines
the
bourbon
barrel
comes
through
clearly
and
adds
a

it

i
cant

it
it
is
light
on

and
almost
flat
plus
some
banana
and

not
very
drinkable
for

i
dont
know
if
the

beer
worked
for

i
like
the
spirit

trying

barrel

rather
than
imperial

theres
bourbon
in

definitely
an

okay
so
i

a

of
this
from
old
farm
in

because
they
had
it
on
a
sale
for
1
89
a
bottle
hell
the
bottle
is
worth
a
buck
to
me
to
homebrew
so
how
the
hell
can
the
beer
not
be
worth
89
cents
had
to
try
a
few
of
the
minhas
beers
pretty
good
looking
beer
but
not
sure
what
i
am
smelling
but
i
have
had
beers
with
no
nose
that
were
tasty
well
not
so
much
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
certainly
not
what
i
would
call
good
the
funny
thing
is
that
i
am
trying
to
figure
out
if
i
would
buy
more
for
the
bottles
and
the
alcohol
i
mean
1
89
nah
rather
save
a
little
liver
mileage
for
something
else
that
said
gonna
use
the
bottle
so
nothing
lost
looks
a
lot
better
than
it
drinks
this
beer
was
less
than
expected
at
the
pour
i
had
thought
i
stumbled
on
a
gem
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
off
white
head
thats
where
the
gem
lost
its
luster
the
smell
was
biscuit
and
banana
strong
banana
the
initial
mouth
feel
was
quite
pleasing
but
the
finish
was
metallic
struggling
to
finish
maybe
it
needs
to
age
longer
maybe
the
sink
need
a
drink
i
may
have
it
again
if
given
wont
be
buying
this
again
even
though
i
did
get
it
for
2
50
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
mahogany
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malty
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
of
malts
sweet
kind
of
mild
compared
to
the
smell
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
is
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
overall
bleh
poorly
done
beer
tastes
like
an
adjunct
beer
that
was
oxidized
and
brewed
mostly
with
corn
syrup
and
straw
o
overall
this
was
uhh
meh
just
mediocre
really
not
worth
the
money
oif
you
are
throwing
a
beer
tasting
party
and
want
bombers
to
sample
to
start
out
newbies
this
would
be
an
outstanding
example
to
serve
to
show
newbies
of
what
a
slightly
above
average
beer
is
should
pair
good
with
food
if
this
were
available
in
7
oz
shorties
id
buy
again
but
otherwise
i
would
only
buy
if
under
1
a
bottle
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
huge
tan
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
toffee
and
brown
sugar
with
an
earthy
mineral
edge
to
provide
some
balance
light
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
heavy
toffee
and
caramel
up
front
theres
a
weird
back
and
forth
between
malt
and
earthy
mineral
and
metallic
flavors
that
sustains
for
most
of
the
flavor
curve
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
mineral
water
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
grew
on
me
a
bit
after
it
warmed
up
i
probably
wouldnt
try
it
again
but
thanks
for
the
opportunity
dave
i
was
surprised
others
scored
this
beer
so
low
and
looking
at
some
of
their
comments
i
think
they
got
bad
batches
poured
a
1
beige
head
of
decent
lifespan
the
body
is
a
deep
dark
burnt
umber
brown
even
held
up
to
the
light
it
smells
very
mildly
of
roasted
malt
so
far
at
this
point
its
very
typical
but
then
the
taste
blew
me
away
a
delicious
complex
sweet
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
cola
and
hopping
reminding
me
of
some
english
ales
and
this
was
a
pretty
decent
value
for
price
i
could
drink
it
all
day
overall
i
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
i
am
struggling
to
finish
it
okay
these
mice
have
had
way
too
much
blood
tea
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
dark
rubygarnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
caramel
dry
biscuit
and
ruby
red
grapefruit
syrup
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dank
tobacco
stale
toffee
bad
tomatoes
and
menthol
wow
this
went
steeply
downhill
very
quickly
ugh
it
honestly
hurts
to
drink
and
the
flavors
malinger
for
what
seems
like
decades
bad
combination
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
another
nicelooking
and
horridtasting
beer
today
just
not
my
day
this
one
poured
out
darker
than
i
expected
the
beer
looks
to
be
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
white
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
light
malt
aromas
some
spice
and
hints
of
molasses
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
upfront
with
some
roasted
notes
and
it
actually
had
a
nice
bitter
finish
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
drinkable
still
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
not
terrible
overall
this
is
the
best
brew
i
got
to
try
while
at
minhas
im
glad
i
got
to
finally
see
what
all
the
antihype
was
that
my
friend
traci
was
telling
me
about
this
brewery
o
for
some
reason
did
not
expect
much
but
pleasantly
surprised
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
beer
strong
tea
tannins
pair
with
cocoa
and
a
rich
toasted
caramel
backbone
with
an
herbal
bitterness
this
works
well
for
an
english
style
ultimately
not
really
a
beer
to
seek
out
and
as
a
budget
buy
at
nearly
6
locally
its
not
much
cheaper
than
craft
bombers
or
sixers
that
taste
much
better
if
people
are
paying
less
than
3
for
this
ive
been
ripped
off
o
th
claim
of
this
mystical
creature
has
fallen
short
delivery
an
easter
bunny
rather
than
a
powerful
fierce
creature
of
myth
and
legend
this
ale
is
not
entirely
bad
but
truly
bland
and
not
as
complex
as
should
be
the
hops
are
timid
and
the
malts
are
not
bold
either
for
what
it
is
a
3
bomber
i
can
appreciate
it
however
a
great
asa
it
is
not
clear
reddish
brown
with
some
fizzy
bubbles
that
lingered
and
formed
a
slid
cap
balance
of
sweetness
and
hops
in
the
aroma
and
flavour
hints
of
mint
and
bread
with
some
currant
and
date
fruitiness
medium
body
and
carbon
dioxide
with
decent
texture
solid
the
best
of
the
four
from
minhas
weve
had
but
thats
not
saying
a
whole
lot
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
1
5
fingers
of
soapy
tan
head
with
little
to
no
retention
and
lace
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
bootstrap
molasses
mostly
perhaps
an
extremely
ghostly
whiff
of
earthy
hops
making
me
recheck
the
label
and
goggle
in
wonder
at
the
80
ibu
printed
on
the
bottle
im
not
really
sure
i
believe
that
claim
flavor
is
sickly
molasses
sweet
also
vacant
of
the
espoused
80
ibus
on
the
label
but
has
a
disturbing
metallic
finish
on
the
strangely
astringent
monotonous
grain
flavor
for
a
strong
ale
i
was
expecting
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
complexity
than
what
i
received
here
texture
is
just
medium
bodied
carbonation
actually
is
fitting
for
support
not
too
much
nor
too
little
but
problems
exist
within
what
is
being
supported
oi
would
clasify
this
as
one
of
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
do
not
normally
drink
asas
but
i
may
have
to
give
this
beer
more
shots
in
my
beer
rotation
o
very
surprised
by
this
beer
the
perfect
strong
ale
for
someone
who
wants
to
try
the
style
or
someone
whos
new
to
craft
beer
in
general
the
price
really
cant
be
beat
either
especially
for
the
style
for
2
39
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
i
especially
love
this
beer
since
its
from
such
a
small
local
brewery
here
in
wisconsin
a
great
cheep
beer
o
this
has
some
barleywine
and
stout
characteristics
with
nice
rich
toffee
notes
and
good
support
with
the
yeast
character
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
strong
but
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
counteract
it
overall
this
is
probably
the
one
i
like
best
of
the
bombers
i
have
had
from
the
minhas
brewery
give
it
a
try
and
im
sure
youll
be
atleast
somewhat
satisfied
an
oddly
appealing
beer
with
a
heavy
emphasis
on
sweetness
without
full
maltiness
this
leaves
me
wanting
much
more
malt
crispness
and
less
raw
sweetness
the
claimed
high
hopping
rates
also
leave
me
wanting
more
wow
it
started
off
so
well
what
could
have
gone
wrong
ill
tell
you
minhas
has
found
a
new
way
to
fuck
with
me
instead
of
obviously
flawridden
bottom
of
the
barrel
lagers
theyre
now
pushing
pseudocraft
offerings
which
ring
with
the
same
sensibility
as
bmcs
similar
ilk
and
theyre
in
bombers
to
boot
this
one
looks
good
smells
decent
enough
and
then
whooosh
through
the
trap
door
you
go
like
my
previous
experience
with
their
heh
chocolate
stout
the
aphorism
lipstick
on
a
pig
was
never
more
apt
and
to
play
into
their
label
chicanery
no
i
wish
that
this
beer
was
not
for
real
cheapest
bomber
around
or
not
this
is
quite
a
strong
ale
i
cant
get
a
grasp
on
the
style
i
guess
it
is
sort
of
a
belgian
goldenpale
ale
great
looking
pour
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
and
golden
to
copper
body
scents
of
esters
of
apple
and
alcohol
maybe
some
pears
medium
bodied
with
again
a
belgian
golden
mouth
feel
pears
apples
and
apricot
the
drawback
is
a
huge
alcohol
kick
back
that
is
quite
noticeable
but
not
unpleasant
the
deist
thomas
jefferson
who
supposedly
crafted
this
beer
in
the
1700s
must
have
had
quite
a
high
tolerance
to
consider
this
one
a
tavern
ale
worth
but
still
worth
a
shot
prost
superb
drinkability
and
flavor
goes
down
like
a
session
beer
and
and
hits
like
a
velvet
hammer
just
excellent
and
if
an
accurate
recreation
jefferson
was
at
the
top
of
home
brewing
field
along
with
washington
o
i
think
its
cool
if
this
really
is
based
off
a
recipe
that
was
made
and
drunk
those
years
ago
its
nothing
crazy
but
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
and
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
that
would
make
this
a
real
nice
fireside
sipper
great
beer
price
is
affordable
higher
abv
but
not
boozy
an
overall
mild
well
balanced
ale
3
085
its
not
a
case
of
great
recipe
blah
execution
here
its
the
other
way
around
instead
i
really
like
this
one
one
of
the
best
english
ales
made
in
america
tastes
like
yuengling
but
a
little
better
without
the
dry
mouth
will
drink
again
yards
may
have
followed
thomas
jeffersons
original
recipe
but
they
obviously
veered
from
the
path
at
some
point
for
something
that
sounds
different
even
niche
on
the
surface
tavern
ale
is
actually
quite
conventional
and
entirely
approachable
for
the
average
beer
drinker
theres
nothing
at
all
revolutionary
about
it
it
seems
traditional
recipes
arent
quite
the
same
thing
when
brewed
with
modern
technologies
and
with
modern
palates
in
mind
a
good
ale
that
does
not
taste
anywhere
as
strong
8
as
it
is
holy
moly
does
not
taste
like
8
abv
very
nice
pours
a
clear
light
red
with
little
head
nice
clean
caramel
malt
aroma
with
little
hops
caramel
and
a
bit
of
toffee
amid
a
bread
crust
note
nice
caramel
flavor
with
medium
low
hop
bitterness
nice
bready
notes
throughout
a
nice
brown
ale
it
arrives
at
the
table
with
a
tight
topographically
variegated
foamy
cap
surmounting
a
perfect
amber
body
with
a
perpetual
upward
swirl
of
tiny
bubbles
the
enticing
aroma
is
of
toffee
or
perhaps
flan
the
beers
flavor
brings
home
the
aromas
promise
of
savory
sophisticated
sweetness
its
a
soft
and
smooth
tastealmost
that
of
a
comfort
foodyet
deeply
satisfying
as
beer
the
texture
is
rich
for
all
of
its
8
it
goes
down
easily
im
a
little
reticent
about
giving
a
beer
this
high
of
a
rating
but
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
a
pleasantly
refreshing
ale
which
neatly
hides
the
8
abv
this
seems
like
a
lawnmower
beer
until
it
runs
over
you
a
solid
english
strong
ale
not
entirely
forgettable
worthy
of
a
pickup
pleasing
finger
of
eggshell
white
foam
adequate
retention
the
lacing
sticks
for
a
brief
while
more
breadth
than
length
to
the
streaks
bright
zinc
orange
colored
liquid
quite
a
few
visible
bubbles
and
they
are
superfat
transparent
and
clean
throughout
theres
a
wellcooked
bread
crust
stiffness
to
the
nose
however
at
the
same
time
sweet
grapefruit
to
orange
citrus
honey
and
ripe
apricot
peach
notes
then
more
peppery
grainy
bite
definitely
has
an
earthy
funk
to
it
as
well
a
forest
floor
covered
with
pine
needles
and
fallen
leaves
and
branches
fullbodied
sweet
and
sticky
attack
even
though
the
carbonation
does
punch
as
hard
as
possible
to
get
things
stirred
up
actually
turns
appreciably
drier
through
the
midpalate
earthy
and
herbal
the
return
of
banana
and
bubblegum
seems
close
to
belgian
loses
most
of
the
honey
as
well
as
the
juiciness
in
the
apricot
peach
apple
fruit
the
citrus
in
turn
comes
off
as
more
sour
the
textural
fullness
extends
the
finish
when
most
of
the
primary
flavors
have
begun
to
trail
off
due
to
its
palate
weight
cant
say
it
is
sessionable
or
the
like
but
it
has
this
unique
just
offcenter
character
which
ultimately
keeps
you
sipping
again
and
again
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
presentation
from
yards
i
liked
the
tavern
porter
but
this
beats
it
hands
down
pours
out
a
deep
gold
with
a
shorterlived
creamy
white
head
not
much
lacing
left
the
aroma
is
pretty
minimalist
with
some
mild
light
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
robust
with
some
nice
balance
from
the
rye
and
the
honey
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
but
it
fits
with
the
almost
delicate
flavors
which
doesnt
really
include
alcohol
despite
the
8
abv
the
third
president
knew
something
about
brewing
overall
my
second
ancient
beer
of
the
evening
interesting
but
in
both
cases
they
lack
the
bitter
balance
i
prefer
hope
to
return
to
the
21st
century
tomorrow
o
decent
beer
i
would
say
this
is
my
second
favorite
in
the
ales
of
the
revolution
series
with
the
porter
being
the
best
and
the
spruce
ale
coming
in
last
the
flavor
has
a
brown
malt
toasted
quality
with
spiced
yeast
element
that
enhances
the
moderately
bitter
hop
profile
and
there
is
a
gentle
english
yeast
with
mineral
quality
that
comes
in
near
the
finish
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
overall
a
pretty
decent
strong
ale
you
get
the
english
influence
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
strength
overall
enjoyable
to
drink
i
was
surprised
since
the
smell
was
nothing
special
the
taste
was
much
more
memorable
decent
complexity
the
fact
this
was
based
off
of
thomas
jeffersons
ale
recipe
adds
intrigue
here
a
great
ale
indeed
ive
had
this
both
on
tap
and
in
bottle
the
latter
is
more
subdued
and
hopforward
while
the
tap
version
has
a
sweetness
on
the
front
end
which
was
pleasantly
surprising
either
way
this
is
a
wellbalanced
ale
which
is
imminently
drinkable
and
for
better
or
worse
never
belies
its
high
octane
nature
16
oz
draft
on
tap
at
the
victory
athletic
association
medium
carbonation
nice
lacing
great
appearance
in
my
glass
i
could
not
pick
up
as
much
of
a
smell
as
i
reach
middle
age
and
my
senses
dim
gotta
say
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
enjoyable
ale
on
a
saturday
afternoon
o
time
travel
is
interesting
but
ultimately
not
quite
all
that
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
but
then
i
wonder
how
jefferson
would
have
reviewed
firestone
walker
double
jack
when
in
the
course
of
human
drinking
affairs
overall
according
to
yards
this
beer
was
crafted
from
thomas
jeffersons
original
recipe
using
wheat
honey
and
rye
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
damn
good
beer
one
that
will
be
on
my
rotation
of
usual
beers
as
will
be
the
general
washingtons
tavern
porter
another
home
run
from
yards
o
a
hard
beer
to
pinpoint
very
unique
overall
this
beer
is
certainly
strong
though
it
does
not
taste
overpowering
and
there
is
almost
no
residual
sweetness
which
suggests
it
fermented
out
completely
this
is
one
of
a
series
of
3
traditional
ales
from
yards
so
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
other
two
compare
pours
clearish
light
copper
with
ring
of
foam
mild
malt
nose
hard
to
flesh
out
taste
is
a
funky
stale
malt
odd
bitter
close
that
is
a
bit
persistent
classic
mixture
somehow
comes
together
odd
but
it
works
overall
i
am
deeming
this
lovely
lady
world
class
she
gets
the
cate
blanchett
award
for
being
a
true
beauty
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
and
i
feel
that
it
fits
beer
advocates
criteria
to
a
t
although
they
mention
a
solvent
aroma
as
part
of
the
class
and
i
dont
get
that
or
want
that
5
out
of
5
on
this
baby
yards
i
dont
think
that
i
have
given
a
score
like
that
yet
o
pretty
boring
flavors
and
a
mediocre
beer
overall
id
pass
this
one
by
o
this
is
a
great
brew
you
do
not
taste
or
feel
the
8
at
all
if
this
is
actually
derived
from
jeffersons
recipe
then
beer
drinkers
back
then
would
be
proud
to
know
that
it
has
kept
up
with
beers
of
this
era
good
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
overall
a
rather
boring
beer
not
something
id
drink
more
of
o
always
fun
to
have
something
from
yards
these
guys
have
consistently
made
some
good
stuff
after
having
this
and
the
washington
porter
i
need
to
get
a
bottle
of
ben
franklins
spiced
ale
from
notes
72711
pours
a
translucent
medium
brownish
orange
eggshell
head
aroma
is
caramel
cider
spice
and
a
some
booze
its
not
very
good
taste
is
a
kinda
one
note
sweetness
with
a
bitter
boozy
finish
lots
of
malt
shows
up
but
it
lacks
complexity
just
sweet
caramel
feel
is
too
thin
its
not
terrible
but
it
could
be
drier
or
richer
or
more
complex
theres
just
something
missing
on
top
of
that
even
though
there
arent
a
ton
of
english
strong
ales
around
i
still
consider
it
a
strong
style
and
this
beer
just
doesnt
live
up
to
other
takes
for
me
that
said
i
do
plan
to
give
it
another
shot
flavor
profile
starts
off
with
malty
sweetness
but
its
held
nicely
in
check
by
a
mild
hop
bitterness
overall
its
quite
well
balanced
for
an
8
beer
caramel
and
toffee
for
the
most
part
with
some
bright
hops
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
straight
down
the
middle
of
spectrumand
carbonation
is
neither
lacking
nor
overly
fizzy
i
guess
id
liken
this
to
an
imperial
esb
this
beer
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
achieves
great
flavor
and
balance
for
a
strong
ale
overall
a
beautiful
simple
reminder
of
what
an
ale
can
bestrong
but
drinkable
aggressive
but
rewardingworth
the
sampler
purchase
by
itself
o
ive
had
better
english
strong
ales
but
this
isnt
bad
its
really
drinkable
o
this
strong
ale
wasnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
i
enjoyed
the
complex
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
seemed
that
it
could
have
used
a
stronger
smell
o
well
rounded
with
a
good
depth
of
flavor
seems
like
it
hits
the
mark
for
style
light
amber
in
color
with
yellow
hues
and
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
maintained
a
thick
cap
throughout
that
huge
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
earthy
malt
and
toffee
aromas
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
oily
feel
up
front
and
a
tangy
crisp

end
finishes
crisp
and
dry
with

higher
abv
is
well
hidden
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
local
yards
brewery
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
dont
think
it
really
drinks
like
an
8
percent
beer
usually
does
deceptively
strong
and
tasty
o
an
other
solid
beer
from
yards
i
will
pick
this
up
again
a
nice
unique
beer
o
interesting
but
more
spice
than
i
like
on
a
regular
basis
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
to
be
fair
this
did
live
up
to
its
style
as
this
was
quite
strong
but
as
i
said
before
the
alcohol
complemented
everything
else
nicely
the
balanced
is
here
for
those
looking
for
a
good
example
of
this
style
to
savor
this
is
a
good
beginning
the
namesake
on
the
bottle
would
be
well
pleased
if
he
could
give
this
a
go
i
poured
the
beer
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
noted
that
after
i
opened
the
bottle
the
beer
foamed
the
beer
was
slightly
below
room
temperature
by
the
way
the
color
is
a
good
amber
color
the
head
dissapated
quickly
there
wasnt
much
lace
on
the
glass
i
could
smell
something
but
it
was
weak
and
my
sense
of
smell
is
weak
i
could
taste
some
citrus
and
spice
i
was
reminded
of
an
orange
spice
bread
i
had
once
i
could
pick
up
some
caramel
the
sweetness
went
away
the
aftertaste
was
dry
overall
much
easier
to
drink
then
i
would
have
expected
with
a
decent
flavor
profile
not
too
shabby
d
strong
but
with
a
nice
bouquet
powerful
sense
of
history
throw
back
a
few
of
these
and
youre
ready
to
go
kick
some
british
ass
this
is
a
complex
and
tasty
brew
that
makes
one
dream
of
discussing
taxation
without
representation
while
knocking
down
a
pint
or
two
yards
just
keeps
on
making
great
beers
these
guys
are
truely
masters
in
most
of
their
beers
i
can
really
taste
the
pale
ale
malt
much
like
ipswich
gearys
and
the
uk
imports
o
really
cant
get
past
the
sweetness
on
this
one
its
not
a
caramelized
malt
sweetness
its
something
else
entirely
just
doesnt
taste
right
complex
approachable
great
concept
all
4s
this
is
a
throwback
to
the
turn
of
the
century
ales
that
were
brewed
back
in
the
day
one
of
my
favorite
beers
partially
cause
i
am
homer
bought
at
food
and
friends
in
philadelphia
appropriately
enough
in
the
12
oz
bottle
i
still
like
the
spruce
best
but
this
is
very
drinkable
d
this
was
a
great
historic
ale
with
a
strong
herbal
blend
that
worked
well
in
the
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
great
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
very
well
crafted
definitely
worth
a
try
o
if
jefferson
named
this
a
tavern
ale
i
would
say
he
had
good
beer
sense
in
addition
to
other
faculties
this
is
a
mellow
drinking
ale
with
a
high
abv
it
is
pretty
smooth
offering
malt
some
hops
and
a
rich
burnt
flavor
one
can
feel
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
throat
and
in
the
belly
but
it
is
not
blended
poorly
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
and
though
it
does
not
overpower
with
flavor
it
has
enough
to
allow
the
beer
to
be
a
sipper
it
fits
tavern
ale
well
a
beer
one
can
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
some
food
jefferson
knew
how
to
make
a
good
beer
as
well
as
a
good
country
o
of
the
3
beers
in
the
variety
pack
this
is
likely
my
2
choice
behind
washingtons
porter
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
i
just
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
everyday
as
it
has
a
little
too
much
sweetness
weighing
it
down
its
great
trying
to
taste
what
the
founding
fathers
drank
at
some
point
but
im
glad
that
i
can
live
and
drink
in
the
present
time
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
only
average
the
booze
was
a
little
too
assertive
even
for
the
style
and
drinkability
was
only
fair
definitely
warming
flavors
also
seemed
a
little
muddled
to
me
sweet
but
dry
in
the
finish
its
a
beautiful
golden
brown
with
tiny
specs
of
sediment
within
unfiltered
is
good
in
my
book
carbonated
with
only
a
thin
ring
of
a
head
though
aroma
fresh
soap
and
linen
somehow
toasted
malt
grainybready
interesting
dichotomy
flavor
is
sharp
on
the
tongue
and
somewhat
heavy
definitely
very
tangysour
although
there
is
surely
some
hops
in
the
finish
im
not
sure
where
that
bite
comes
from
exactly
the
alcohol
not
a
bad
thing
but
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
all
night
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
slightly
sweet
taste
is
a
bit
unusual
bready
hops
sour
some
alcohol
seems
like
lots
of
flavors
pulling
in
different
directions
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
this
obviously
quite
young
because
it
does
taste
a
little
brash
opening
up
with
candied
fruits
a
little
caramel
and
toffee
this
is
quite
nice
burnt
sugar
does
lend
a
little
bitterness
but
i
do
detect
some
hoppy
bitterness
as
well
bready
this
is
mildly
alcoholic
on
the
backend
medium
full
in
body
with
soft
carbonation
this
beer
feels
quite
nice
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
especially
nice
with
a
lingering
toffee
sweetness
and
burnt
sugar
bitterness
theres
aspects
to
it
that
make
me
think
whiskey
the
flavor
notes
are
wellintegrated
for
the
most
part
and
this
beer
is
quite
nicely
done
solid
stuff
id
drink
it
again
overall
interesting
beer
worth
trying
not
one
id
seek
out
for
a
subtle
beer
i
happen
to
enjoy
this
one
a
lot
a
touch
of
bright
fruit
balances
the
richness
of
the
beer
on
the
finish
making
the
large
body
more
approachable
pretty
damn
good
d
this
one
is
amazingly
drinkable
i
never
wouldve
guessed
the
alcohol
was
so
high
it
drinks
somewhere
between
a
refreshing
european
pils
and
a
biscuity
pale
ale
and
is
quite
good
o
i
like
this
more
than
the
rating
indicates
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
very
much
this
is
definitely
a
nice
winter
beer
though
its
warm
and
inviting
overall
for
8
this
is
a
super
easy
drinker
and
few
can
go
down
fast
and
smooth
i
also
enjoyed
the
8
six
pack
the
mouthfeel
is
grassy
hoppy
and
thick
the
bitterness
lingers
after
swallowing
but
the
bitterness
is
not
too
strong
it
is
really
just
right
i
normally
prefer
malt
forward
brews
but
yards
got
the
hop
level
in
this
one
just
right
this
is
great
for
any
time
of
the
year
but
i
believe
this
brew
would
be
best
in
summer
and
served
at
a
barbecue
or
other
outdoor
party
o
you
could
probably
warm
this
up
and
serve
it
like
tea
it
has
herbal
spice
and
sweet
characteristics
all
throughout
id
say
its
a
good
representation
of
what
they
were
drinking
back
then
o
love
the
idea
and
the
beer
is
ok
id
go
b
on
this
one
i
think
that
some
carbonation
would
help
this
out
a
bit
the
beer
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
thin
but
thick
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
smell
has
a
slight
hop
smell
to
it
with
some
malt
coming
through
the
taste
is
fruity
with
some
bitterness
of
the
hops
coming
in
right
after
wards
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
over
all
is
a
good
strong
ale
overtall
this
beer
is
enjoyable
there
are
many
fine
ales
out
there
whether
id
choose
yards
tavern
ale
over
others
is
debatable
maybe
its
thomas
jeffersons
portrait
that
will
jog
my
memory
mouthfeel
is
very
wellbalanced
for
a
beer
with
8
abv
nice
change
from
the
bottle
overall
would
have
been
so
much
better
if
it
werent
for
the
irony
taste
at
the
end
o
its
an
ok
strong
ale
nothing
really
stood
out
for
me
but
i
didnt
have
a
problem
with
it
probably
would
not
pick
it
up
again
though
still
like
the
ales
of
revolution
series
though
cool
idea
nice
worth
trying
o
an
interesting
beer
good
to
have
tried
but
not
one
ill
return
to
unless
the
pickings
are
slim
overall
at
first
this
didnt
seem
real
interesting
but
as
it
went
along
it
got
better
it
does
come
off
though
as
just
a
bit
average
for
me
the
aroma
was
rather
weak
for
me
typical
english
ale
with
a
huge
malt
bill
attached
to
it
lotso
of
bready
notes
here
coing
through
now
with
that
deep
musty
like
smell
like
wet
hey
it
would
seem
at
times
the
flavor
followed
it
up
almost
perfectl
with
a
solid
offering
of
english
malts
and
a
nice
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
albeit
not
much
but
just
enough
to
give
it
some
depth
lots
of
musky
wet
earthy
flavors
here
as
well
coming
through
with
the
finish
being
very
nice
and
drawn
out
which
suprised
me
overall
a
great
beer
d
after
making
my
way
through
this
ales
of
the
revolutiony
variety

i
guess
historically
recreated
beers
just
arent
my
thing

bitter

not
in

8
abv
overall
a
tasty
offering
from

well
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
of
these
without

cheers
d
nice
beer
i
am
really
enjoying
the
huge
malt
character
which
is
balanced
out
with
the
spicy
hop
flavor
the
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
for
8
abv
and
even
though
i
could
easily
go
a
few
rounds
i
would
prefer
it
as
a
sipping
beer
overall
a
good
strong
ale
that
is
worth
checking
out
way
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
at
8
not
especially
profound
by
any
means
but
great
as
an
after
work
i
aint
doin
shit
style
beer
o
interesting
but
i
wish
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
complex
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
its
nose
overall
its
tasty
and
interesting
overall
tavern
ale
is
definitely
a
strong
ale
the
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
notes
in
the
aoma
taste
make
you
quickly
realize
that
this
is
a
big
beer
however
those
traits
subside
into
a
more
easier
drinking
ale
that
would
make
our
ancestors
proud
id
recommend
this
to
others
to
try
overall
good
english
strong
ale
with
nice
fruit
characteristics
didnt
really
care
to
much
for
the
mouthfeel
nose
was
really
good
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
but
when
you
really
inhaled
it
was
very
nice
i
would
purchase
this
again
and
again
if
it
was
available
in
california
o
decent
english
strong
ale
good
session
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
overall
pretty
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
nice
cloudy
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
spice
notes
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
nice
little
spice
note
medium
body
a
nice
little
brew
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
it
quite
a
big
beer
the
body
was
full
and
solid
without
being
heavy
drinkability
was
very
good
especially
for
an
8
brew
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
certainly
have
this
in
my
regular
rotation
if
it
were
local
to
me
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
mo
very
good
interpretation
of
a
homely
bar
style
beer
that
has
some
good
richness
while
maintaining
some
real
drinkablilty
i
think
the
beer
seeks
to
be
a
refined
and
modern
interpretation
of
what
might
be
served
back
in
old
philadelphia
o
not
a
bad
beer
from
what
ive
had
of
yards
theyve
been
a
nice
eastern
brewery
whom
ive
not
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
but
have
recently
been
pleased
to
try
o
drinkable
and
good
flavor
worth
revisiting
again
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
my
first
offering
from
yards
brewing
co
and
its
good
enough
for
me
to
seek
out
more
of
their
beers
while
my
experience
with
this
style
is
admittedly
limited
i
would
if
asked
probably
recommend
this
one
d
malts
are
a
little
out
of
balance
with
the
finish
in
this
one
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
surprised
me
a
bit
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
little
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
basically
all
malts
and
some
other
farmhouse
grains
in
there
too
the
taste
wasnt
very
impressive
to
me
the
taste
had
an
odd
sourness
to
it
not
sour
like
a
lambic
but
something
different
it
was
an
interesting
difference
but
didnt
really
help
the
beer
at
all
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
bad
i
would
try
this
one
again
because
id
like
to
see
if
it
still
has
the
weird
flavor
to
it
d
great
easy
drinker
but
not
a
session
beer
cause
of
alcohol
content
but
easily
would
drink
another
or
ten
dr
i
like
this
stuff
i
had
no
clue
it
was
8
until
i
popped
up
the
review
window
a
decent
sipper
but
not
one
id
go
back
to
again
d
the
more
i
drink
the
less
i
like
it
ill
sleep
good
tonight
or
ill
be
praying
to
the
porceline
god
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
overall
its
a
decent
beer
i
dont
think
ive
had
very
many
beers
like
this
one
the
carbonation
is
high
which
when
coupled
with
the
relatively
heavy
consistency
of
the
beer
makes
for
quite
an
enjoyable
texture
on
the
palate
however
the
high
abv
noticeable
alcohol
and
not
enough
balance
between
the
sweet
fruits
and
caramel
and
the
strong
earthiness
its
a
hard
one
to
get
down
easily
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
wasnt
wowed
by
it
but
decent
enough
to
try
again
drinkability
to
me
this
is
more
of
siping
beer
than
a
drinking
beer
the
alcohol
is
too
noticeable
for
me
on
the
finish
it
outweighs
the
nice
strong
sweet
tastes
on
the
start
not
a
great
beer
but
a
nice
beet
that
i
am
willing
to
try
again
drinkability
great
drinkability
for
an
aboveaverage
abv
my
200th
review
that
deserves
some
merit
as
this
beer
holds
dear
to
me
as
i
had
several
of
this
beer
at
my
rehearsal
dinner
the
night
before
my
wedding
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
andor
on
tap
in
a
chilled
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
orange
body
a
little
darker
than
orange
with
a
sudsy
beige
head
aroma
of
pale
malts
slight
spices
and
candy
sugar
tastes
strongly
of
nuts
and
caramel
sweet
but
layered
earth
cracker
and
pine
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
some
bockish
grape
touch
of
smoke
touch
of
spice
in
the
back
wonderfully
crisp
just
that
perfect
medium
level
with
a
touch
of
sourness
light
bitterness
medium
body
that
can
go
either
full
or
light
depending
on
the
moment
nice
herbal
quality
a
very
authentic
english
strong
ale
that
i
understand
that
closely
aligned
with
thomas
jeffersons
creation
and
style
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
as
i
have
drank
this
beer
all
night
before
but
i
really
wouldnt
call
it
a
session
beer
d
this
beer
goes
down
easier
than
most
8
abvs
exercise
caution
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
for
an
8abv
beer
appearently
jefferson
had
it
right
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
quality
offering
from
yards
who
continues
to
impress
me
this
is
a
solid
maltheavy
ale
but
not
a
brew
for
which
i
would
make
a
point
of
seeking
in
the
future
if
someone
offered
this
to
me
at
a
party
though
i
would
be
happy
to
partake
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
slightly
below
average
carbonation
the
lower
carbonation
worked
pretty
well
for
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
and
felt
pretty
well
balanced
i
really
like
the
concept
and
the
history
behind
it
jefferson
had
a
pretty
good
beer
here
thanks
to
my
mother
for
bringing
this
from
d
c
slainte
murky
dark
orange
with
small
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
sugars
citrus
lemon
zest
some
alcohol
and
spices
clean
taste
of
citrus
floral
notes
prunes
tang
spices
slight
alcohol
burn
towards
the
finish
along
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
drink
rides
out
with
some
caramel
and
prune
flavors
medium
in
body
with
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
could
easily
go
for
another
12
oz
bottle
this
is
a
tasty
well
crafted
beer
another
style
i
am
not
quite
fond
of
but
i
do
like
this
one
pours
a
nice
moderate
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
brings
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
with
caramel
candied
fruits
light
citrus
and
some
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
definitely
sweet
with
a
bit
of
booze
light
fruits
bread
and
cake
feel
is
medium
with
lowish
carbonation
drinks
well
overall
drinkability
the
strongness
of
the
alcohol
flavor
makes
this
a
sipper
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
this
is
a
nice
amber
beer
with
a
fluffy
dense
head
with
good
retention
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
nice
the
beer
has
a
good
toffee
caramel
smell
i
also
think
i
am
getting
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruitiness
as
well
the
taste
reflects
the
smell
with
more
of
the
fruity
character
coming
through
for
me
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bigger
mouthfeel
it
is
about
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
almost
no
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
different
beer
than
when
i
had
it
fresher
it
has
5
or
6
mos
on
it
the
carbonation
mellowed
out
and
the
hops
faded
giving
way
to
the
almost
barleywineesque
character
very
easy
drinker
for
the
high
abv
d
yeah
its
8
so
what
i
liked
this
a
lot
on
draft
and
continue
to
like
it
from
the
bottle
an
intriguing
and
flavorful
beer
that
would
do
mr
jefferson
proud
i
can
imagine
him
out
in
the
fields
at
monticello
cultivating
his
crops
stirring
the
wort
sampling
the
unfinished
ale
then
finally
kicking
back
on
the
porch
for
a
tankardfull
well
really
i
cant
except
for
the
porch
part
the
rest
may
have
been
left
to
the
indentured
servants
but
who
knows
what
i
know
is
this
tjs
tavern
ale
is
an
enjoyable
brew
one
id
love
to
have
more
of
well
done
once
again
yards
d
not
bad
i
was
suprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
i
was
apprehensive
to
try
this
one
considering
yards
pale
ale
reminds
me
of
celery
and
tobacco
not
a
good
combo
this
one
is
much
better
by
comparison
a
somewhat
hazy
deep
copper
colored
brew
with
a
very
healthy
light
oatmeal
colored
head
with
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
yeasty
caramel
malt
with
apple
hops
hints
the
flavor
is
pretty
sharp
maple
syrup
with
an
interesting
juniper
burst
this
is
kind
of
thick
stuff
a
mid
to
full
body
with
a
somewhat
syrupy
feel
i
pick
up
caramel
and
tart
apple
maybe
even
butterscotch
lots
of
flavor
but
not
the
smoothest
concoction
worth
a
try
not
highly
drinkable
this
is
yet
another
winner
from
yards
they
always
have
good
looking
good
tasting
brews
good
tasting
brew
and
at
8
alcohol
makes
for
a
nice
session
that
will
hit
you
hard
later
good
stuff
interesting
concept
and
pretty
tasty
beer
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
yards
poured
into
a
pint
glass
showed
yellowish
golden
brown
with
a
good
head
and
retention
smell
of
sweet
bready
malts
some
earthy
grains
and
even
slightly
dry
and
bitter
taste
similar
to
the
smell
very
bready
and
malty
sweet
with
some
good
carbonation
no
trace
of
the
8
abv
very
drinkable
so
there
are
tradeoffs
and
you
cant
be
more
virginian
than
drinking
this
stuff
on
presidents
day
d
i
really
like
this
one
the
abv
is
a
little
high
to
make
it
a
session
kind
of
beer
but
one
or
two
would
be
great
on
a
cool
evening
jefferson
was
a
pretty
damn
good
brewer
this
beer
is
pretty
hard
on
the
palate
it
has
a
nice
and
zesty
carbonation
but
it
isnt
very
smooth
ive
tried
it
twice
but
probably
wont
be
interested
much
in
the
future
drinkability
nice
and
strong
but
not
overly
strong
certainly
would
recommend
trying
this
mild
style
of
high
abv
beer
its
fair
to
say
thomas
jefferson
got
me
a
buzz
and
could
brew
a
pretty
excellent
beer
pours
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aromas
are
more
subdued
than
i
expected
but
good
nonetheless
smells
predominately
malty
with
caramel
and
notes
of
breadiness
interesting
herbal
aromas
are
also
present
as
is
a
faint
whiff
of
alcohol
tastes
of
big
chewy
sweet
malts
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
right
up
front
feels
heavy
as
a
stone
and
couldnt
be
less
filling
if
were
a
bag
of
sand
its
biggest
drawback
is
that
it
lingers
long
on
unappealing
notes
of
mainly
alcohol
this
is
not
the
way
i
wanted
such
an
otherwise
tasty
beer
to
finish
fascinating
nonetheless
worth
trying
in
the
end
this
is
a
very
good
strong
ale
but
the
textures
could
be
smoother
and
a
fuller
rounder
flavor
and
feel
could
help
complete
the
session
drinkability
overall
its
decently
drinkable
but
not
mind
blowing
the
beer
is
good
but
not
necessarily
great
has
decent
balance
but
overall
certain
more
on
the
malty
end
a
bit
heavy
and
strong
to
make
great
session
but
its
not
unsatisfactory
either
a
good
beer
overall
but
not
sure
one
id
rush
to
have
again
drinkability
not
a
bad
drinking
brew
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
it
is
lacking
a
bit
in
the
complexity
arena
but
not
bad
its
not
a
style
im
very
familiar
with
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
poured
a
cloudy
copperamber
hue
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
and
great
lacing
smelled
sweet
caramel
apple
honey
and
malt
taste
starts
with
maltyapplemolasses
and
then
eventually
dissolves
to
a
sweet
apple
finish
wellhidden
alcohol
content
no
hint
of
it
thick
and
smooth
creamy
texture
very
good
specimen
of
a
strong
ale
d
a
really
nice
offering
from
yards
i
have
not
experienced
this
style
too
often
but
this
is
a
good
beer
a
higher
abv
makes
me
only
want
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
jefferson
indeed
were
we
to
drink
his
actual
recipe
it
would
taste
terrible
nothin
gainst
ol
tj
just
sayin
this
one
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
topped
by
a
quicklyfading
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
spruce
some
very
light
coffee
i
think
thats
what
that
is
and
a
hint
o
citrus
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
solid
caramel
backbone
but
then
quickly
spreads
out
into
a
panoply
of
citrus
and
floral
bitters
some
peppercorn
is
detectable
near
the
back
throughout
a
vague
maltiness
is
perceived
sorta
like
a
bland
old
ale
hangin
about
in
the
background
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
an
almost
chewy
feel
overall
a
decent
brew
a
good
occasional
but
not
really
a
goto
or
everyday
offering
if
you
ask
me
overall
this
speaks
to
me
as
a
brawny
pale
ale
the
idea
that
this
is
or
may
be
a
jefferson
recipe
enhances
the
experience
no
doubt
ignoring
that
though
this
is
definitely
something
different
and
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
be
warned
you
may
get
tired
of
it
if
you
buy
a
sixer
as
i
did
once
hard
to
get
through
in
any
short
amount
of
time
2
or
3
will
set
your
spirits
high
but
ill
surely
kick
this
growler
by
the
end
of
the
night
seek
and
enjoy
this
is
from
the
presidential
series
from
yards
the
beer
pours
out
a
dark
amber
with
a
bit
of
head
on
the
top
the
flavors
are
dominated
by
malt
and
the
hops
struggle
to
get
their
say
in
this
beer
however
as
the
beer
finishes
the
hops
start
to
make
their
appearance
in
a
subtle
way
the
rare
nonipa
where
the
smell
is
significantly
better
than
the
taste
good
i
love
that
it
evokes
that
specific
sense
memory
but
the
booze
character
is
a
turnoff
i
poured
this
into
a
sam
smith
nonic
it
is
a
dark
orangeamber
colour
and
like
any
good
english
ale
it
has
a
fluffy
white
head
and
good
lacing
im
detecting
some
grapefruit
and
hops
although
its
more
muted
than
your
average
ipa
but
once
you
begin
to
taste
it
there
is
a
thicky
maltiness
almost
caramel
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
dry
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
occasionally
and
i
must
give
yards
credit
for
doing
hard
to
find
british
styles
d
a
pleasant
surprisingly
quaffable
strong
ale
from
yards
kind
of
an
interesting
flavor
although
it
gets
a
little
cumbersome
in
the
body
after
a
while
another
solid
unique
offering
from
this
little
brewery
the
beer
is
a
bit
medium
to
heavy
bodied
and
is
very
smooth
but
yet
pretty
well
carbonated
in
its
finish
very
complex
very
nice
when
i
drink
this
beer
as
i
do
quite
regularly
i
feel
as
if
i
get
timewarped
back
to
a
dingy
old
english
pub
in
the
1800s
i
feel
like
i
should
always
drink
this
out
of
a
pewter
mug
or
something
might
have
to
seek
one
out
i
would
seek
this
brew
out
if
i
were
you
simply
put
if
this
8abv
golden
ale
is
even
close
to
jeffersons
tipple
then
dinners
up
at
monticello
must
have
been
fantastic
richly
fruity
and
with
smooth
caramel
flavours
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
ale
almost
like
some
of
the
best
bitters
i
enjoy
when
i
go
home
to
the
uk
just
with
an
added
alcoholic
glow
why
on
earth
one
of
the
cville
breweries
isnt
making
this
is
quite
simply
beyond
me
as
ever
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
happily
sit
by
a
fire
place
and
enjoy
copious
amounts
of
before
being
poured
into
a
taxi
home
md
full
body
again
not
sticky
or
hot
easy
to
drink
but
sneaks
up
on
ya
not
really
memorable
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
it
again
d
wow
what
a
great
beer
i
have
two
more
ales
of
the
revolution
to
try
the
tavern
spruce
and
tavern
porter
yet
no
treasury
ale
its
advertised
on
the
side
and
yet
it
was
not
included
regardless
great
brew
d
not
bad
and
a
nice
appetizer
beer
this
would
be
good
for
the
spring
session
i
poured
from
a
12ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
slight
white
head
minimal
lacing
big
toasty
malt
notes
on
the
nose
with
hint
of
caramel
and
alcohol
the
malt
really
comes
through
on
firt
sip
with
oak
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
it
finishes
dry
with
the
slightest
hint
of
booze
it
is
well
carbonated
and
a
full
bodied
brew
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
this
one
is
kinda
a
sipper
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
drinks
well
here
very
smooth
malts
make
it
drinkable
md
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
even
along
that
is
quite
pleasant
this
is
very
drinkable
with
no
alcohol
burn
and
a
complex
flavor
that
gets
better
the
longer
it
sits
on
your
tongue
a
simple
no
frills
highly
drinkable
brew
any
time
of
year
my
first
time
trying
a
beer
from
this
brewery
i
found
this
at
the
local
grocery
store
in
a
six
pack
the
beer
has
a
nice
orange
color
with
little
head
and
little
lacing
beer
had
a
nice
not
overpowering
sweetness
to
it
with
a
fairly
bitter
finish
tasted
quite
drinkable
for
its
strength
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
it
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
some
faint
particles
stuck
floating
around
in
suspension
head
appears
slightly
stained
yellow
with
less
than
a
finger
of
strength
and
retains
poorly
leaving
some
lace
clinging
to
the
glassware
nose
is
a
mix
of
herbal
hops
and
sweet
maltiness
blended
with
astringent
alcohol
the
smell
of
the
alcohol
carries
through
into
the
taste
it
has
a
slight
grainy
profile
that
is
bitter
upfront
from
a
combo
of
hops
and
alcohol
that
blends
through
the
body
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
finishes
quite
warming
from
the
alcohol
with
some
lingering
bitterness
medium
feel
with
this
beer
and
it
is
moderately
carbonated
the
alcohol
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
dominant
factor
in
this
beer
with
the
hop
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
trying
to
tame
it
overall
it
isnt
bad
d
a
really
good
beer
with
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
and
an
genrebuster
although
i
think
english
strong
ale
is
a
pretty
good
stab
at
it
a
nice
malty
brew
which
is
crisp
and
not
at
all
cloying
with
good
ale
yeast
characteristics
as
well
a
good
first
brew
from
yards
for
me
d
i
love
the
ales
of
the
revolution
concept
brewing
back
to
life
the
brewing
recipes
of
our
founding
fathers
not
sure
whether
or
not
theres
any
legitimacy
to
the
claim
but
i
would
like
to
think
there
is
quite
quaffable
as
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
easy
drinking
all
the
way
around
drinkability
i
went
through
2
pints
in
about
an
hour
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
ehh
the
alcohol
is
obvious
and
that
doesnt
help
it
says
8
and
i
can
just
tell
its
8
doesnt
mask
the
abv
which
is
probably
a
good
idea
still
its
a
good
beer
pours
copper
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
slight
but
flavor
is
strong
malty
carmelly
maple
dominates
there
is
a
low
flat
bitterness
that
develops
late
the
flavor
has
lots
of
maple
and
molasses
mouthfeel
is
slick
but
a
little
sticky
overall
i
am
a
history
and
beer
fan
so
i
decided
to
try
this
strong
englishstyle
ale
from
yards
it
is
tough
getting
us
beers
to
replicate
their
colonial
cousins
in
the
uk
but
this
is
certainly
a
good
offering
from
yards
def
worth
a
try
very
attractive
dark
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
and
good
lacing
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
but
i
did
smell
some
fruity
malty
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
what
smelled
kind
like
raw
almonds
i
found
the
taste
to
be
quite
nice
nice
and
malty
with
plenty
of
caramel
also
seemed
to
be
a
little
bit
of
toasted
malt
that
gave
it
a
nutty
flavor
it
had
a
nice
amount
of
fruityherbal
hops
that
broke
up
the
maltyness
just
enough
i
did
not
perceive
any
of
the
8
abv
it
has
a
slightly
sticky
finish
with
body
that
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
but
i
found
it
just
dry
enough
to
be
nicely
drinkable
for
its
style
and
abv
this
is
a
good
thing
since
i
can
see
myself
having
more
of
these
in
the
future
overall
this
an
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
and
another
decent
offering
from
yards
worth
a
look
picked
up
a
case
of
the
yards
ales
of
the
revolution
variety
at
the
brewery
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
copper
minimal
head
heavy
spice
and
hop
notes
this
is
a
strong
ale
citrusy
hops
spice
ginger
nutmeg
and
sweet
bready
malt
alcohol
finish
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
enjoyed
this
perhaps
more
so
because
it
is
jeffersons
original
recipe
also
makes
a
mean
cheddar
ale
soup
bottle
into
pint
glass
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
very
small
head
that
didnt
last
at
all
a
ton
of
heavy
toasted
grains
in
the
nose
but
otherwise
no
distinctive
aroma
i
might
even
venture
to
say
it
was
burnt
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
but
holy
hop
the
hop
bitterness
and
the
roast
overpowered
everything
about
halfway
through
the
glass
it
became
too
overpowering
and
i
wasnt
able
to
finish
i
dont
think
ill
be
back
to
this
one
which
is
disappointing
since
i
tend
to
like
the
yards
offerings
mouthfeel
lower
carbonation
very
smooth
quite
boozy
i
recommend
this
beer
to
people
who
tend
to
favor
english
style
ales
as
well
as
red
ales
part
of
the
ales
of
the
revolution
variety
pack
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
shaped
glass
copper
golden
color
it
appears
very
appealing
the
scent
spices
and
a
moderate
hoppiness
full
bodied
flavor
profile
includes
balanced
hops
and
some
citrus
very
well
balanced
between
hops
malts
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
ginger
alcohol
is
covered
by
the
flavor
making
this
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
kind
of
bland
and
nothing
to
outstanding
although
it
paired
well
with
a
nice
chunk
of
dark
chocolate
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
honor
of
one
of
historys
finest
d
this
is
a
ale
that
i
will
drink
again
and
again
d
being
a
strong
ale
its
hard
to
know
what
to
except
and
criticize
its
drinkable
for
8
without
much
knowledge
of
the
alcohol
and
its
reasonably
tasty
but
its
not
something
that
id
seek
out
either
this
beer
is
chewy
up
front
it
opens
right
up
into
a
huge
sweet
presence
that
fills
the
mouth
more
specifically
we
pick
up
caramalized
almonds
a
bit
of
honey
and
candied
oranges
it
arcs
with
some
herbal
sharpness
then
spreads
and
softens
in
the
finish
with
a
massive
dose
of
of
caramel
that
grows
into
roasted
territory
a
wallop
of
sugary
malt
from
start
to
finish
the
nice
surprise
is
that
it
finishes
juuust
crisp
enough
that
some
dryness
enters
the
picture
the
sweetness
doesnt
coat
much
but
instead
leaves
echoes
at
the
top
of
my
mouth
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
lazy
fall
evening
drinkability
since
jeffersons
version
of
this
beer
was
first
brewed
before
the
existence
of
the
current
style
categorizations
it
is
appropriate
that
this
incarnation
of
the
beer
be
in
a
catch
all
category
like
english
strong
ale
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
found
it
easy
to
drink
and
am
expecting
to
have
another
in
fact
im
pleased
there
is
more
left
for
another
evening
and
to
share
with
friends
i
think
jefferson
and
mrs
jefferson
who
also
brewed
in
his
absences
from
monticello
would
approve
of
this
recreation
of
their
recipe
d
pub
style
ale
that
had
that
old
time
feel
to
it
moderate
enjoyment
and
consumption
better
then
average
all
around
but
really
has
no
individual
character
that
i
would
consider
good
in
any
way
wouldnt
drink
this
in
multiples
but
decent
by
itself
though
limited
in
complexity
with
the
booziness
taking
over
the
drink
at
times
a
pretty
high
abv
and
a
big
hearty
mouthfeel
limit
the
drinkability
plus
the
flavors
arent
enough
to
have
me
clamoring
for
my
next
sip
a
sipper
on
the
syrupy
side
an
interesting
one
at
that
wellbalanced
strong
but
not
overbearing
or
harsh
its
one
that
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
overall
character
as
it
progressed
d
excellent
unique
sweet
malty
taste
with
an
agressive
feel
to
it
well
hidden
abvs
can
easily
drink
a
few
in
a
row
a
great
unique
beer
a
good
brew
for
cool
weather
great
beer
from
yards
i
will
definitely
be
searching
for
this
one
drinkablilty
i
would
definitely
drink
this
brew
again
something
i
havent
tasted
in
a
while
and
i
actually
enjoyed
perfect
to
savor
wouldnt
recommend
a
fast
drinking
style
notes
at
city
tavern
in
philly
and
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
night
well
balanced
and
rich
d
this
is
a
better
nightcap
beer
something
big
to
lull
me
to
sleep
as
it
is
i
hope
i
stay
awake
through
the
2nd
half
of
the
early
games
theres
not
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
going
on
here
but
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
though
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
ale
surprised
to
find
this
has
an
abv
of
8
because
it
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
i
like
the
sweetness
and
graininess
of
the
malt
but
its
a
little
thin
and
the
finish
is
just
a
tad
abrasive
an
interesting
beer
i
still
have
no
idea
what
this
really
is
it
seems
a
little
bland
but
with
such
a
generic
bottle
description
i
dont
even
have
an
idea
of
what
the
brewer
was
trying
to
do
the
ale
poured
into
my
tasting
snifter
with
a
golden
ruby
color
and
was
crystal
clear
there
was
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipated
i
couldnt
quite
place
the
aroma
i
could
detect
the
hops
but
other
than
that
its
a
mystery
to
me
yards
website
indicates
that
this
brew
is
made
with
ingredients
indigenous
to
jeffersons
native
virginia
its
quite
pleasing
to
taste
and
you
can
definitely
pick
up
on
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
content
its
an
enjoyable
beer
worth
checking
out
just
to
see
what
the
founding
fathers
drank
appears
a
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
an
odd
mix
of
fruit
and
herbs
the
flavor
makes
a
little
more
sense
thought
its
still
nothing
normal
i
like
that
its
juicy
at
first
then
theres
a
hit
of
biscuity
grains
followed
by
citrus
rind
and
earthy
hops
i
should
mention
the
aroma
hints
at
a
possible
infection
i
cant
tell
if
its
juicy
hops
or
something
more
acidic
and
musty
oh
well
its
good
for
now
worth
a
try
for
something
different
sort
of
like
rock
art
ridge
runner
barleywine
an
imperial
esb
if
such
a
thing
existed
move
along
nothing
to
see
here
i
find
nothing
to
recommend
this
beer
sort
of
a
sweet
bland
high
alcohol
beer
it
poured
nicely
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
but
the
head
died
quickly
it
starts
out
nice
but
ends
with
a
very
bitter
end
i
enjoyed
this
ale
but
half
way
through
the
bitterness
was
making
wish
i
was
done
with
it
pours
a
very
light
copper
to
orange
flavor
with
no
lacing
its
a
bit
overcarbonated
the
head
built
up
a
lot
quicker
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
while
causing
a
couple
of
small
messes
light
scent
its
missing
the
heady
scent
of
most
strong
ales
but
it
has
a
nice
floralfruity
scent
thats
nice
nice
taste
a
good
blend
of
grains
malts
and
hops
along
with
a
little
floral
aftertaste
but
its
a
little
weak
as
far
as
flavor
depth
goes
down
fine
but
the
carbonation
hurt
here
too
pours
a
slightly
fogged
amber
with
a
crème
head
nose
is
slight
piney
hops
full
but
not
in
my
face
flavor
is
outstanding
i
say
nice
full
hop
tones
that
stay
constant
almost
seems
to
be
a
fruity
edge
to
it
that
seems
like
apples
and
a
touch
like
cherries
feel
is
very
smooth
with
carbonation
and
has
a
nice
body
on
the
liquid
overall
this
is
extremely
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
full
character
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
mediumbodied
with
a
dry
finish
nicely
drinkable
d
quite
subtle
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
bit
more
flavor
would
be
beneficial
an
enjoyable
ale
i
hope
the
founding
fathers
enjoyed
ale
such
as
this
and
if
not
im
sure
there
are
many
people
today
who
would
be
happy
to
dont
drink
and
review
light
sweet
wheat
yeast
and
honey
flavors
give
way
to
a
full
dark
hop
profile
finishes
smooth
with
tastes
of
fresh
bread
overall
a
good
beer
with
a
surprisingly
high
alcohol
content
for
its
taste
a
little
surprised
that
this
one
was
called
an
apa
the
flavor
was
strange
certainly
not
standardish
pours
a
dark
amberish
color
nose
is
good
some
spiciness
and
then
a
good
amount
of
malty
sweetness
taste
is
good
lots
of
fruit
all
over
the
place
although
hard
to
pin
down
mostly
malt
overall
some
honey
as
well
hints
of
alcohol
in
the
back
feel
is
mediumbodied
and
good
on
carbonation
a
tasty
beer
although
one
with
a
surprisingly
high
alcohol
content
that
doesnt
really
seem
to
manifest
much
in
a
positive
way
in
the
taste
a
good
one
though
i
can
and
have
sessioned
with
this
one
its
quite
nice
that
jefferson
was
a
bright
fellow
yards
thomas
jefferson
tavern
ale
poured
a
great
amber
color
with
a
creamy
head
unfortunately
the
head
thinned
out
shortly
after
the
poor
but
it
did
not
go
completely
away
the
smell
was
clean
and
light
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
likely
from
the
honey
there
was
a
slight
note
of
caramel
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
set
this
apart
form
other
tavern
or
pub
ales
the
nonbitter
character
of
this
ale
was
a
welcome
change
from
many
ales
in
its
class
the
honey
came
through
in
the
taste
but
certainly
not
too
much
just
the
right
amount
the
smooth
feel
of
this
ale
on
the
tongue
and
its
light
finish
make
this
a
great
ale
to
enjoy
on
many
occasions
cheers
the
beer
is
a
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
for
me
which
is
less
then
average
overall
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
for
being
8
taste
is
thick
for
an
apa
really
alcoholic
but
there
is
some
malt
hop
balance
thick
finish
you
can
still
taste
everything
for
sure
after
its
gone
mouthfeel
is
intense
good
drinkability
for
a
dinner
meal
like
the
one
at
city
tavern
i
would
like
this
again
for
another
big
dinner
i
guess
those
founding
fathers
did
have
some
brewing
ideas
after
all
and
where
the
nose
is
herbal
and
such
the
mouth
is
malty
and
also
herbal
supposedly
a
truthful
rendition
of
what
the
jeff
would
have
brewed
himself
its
a
tasty
brew
that
feels
every
bit
historical
takes
a
while
to
develop
but
once
warm
the
malts
strengthen
up
hops
turn
a
bit
fruity
a
faint
but
distinct
grapefruit
in
there
still
herbal
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
which
is
surprisingly
high
and
very
well
hidden
the
mouth
is
solid
with
good
carbonation
a
decent
drying
finish
really
a
good
beer
that
could
easily
turn
into
an
everyday
beer
cheers
two
things
immediately
jumped
out
at
me
regarding
this
beer
1
no
matter
how
hard
i
tried
i
could
not
get
it
to
produce
any
head
beyond
mere
wisps
and
2
it
had
a
nebraskaquality
to
its
clarity
which
is
not
usually
the
case
for
yards
the
color
was
a
bright
copper
and
the
nose
had
a
biscuity
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
i
got
a
definite
biscuit
taste
in
the
mouth
the
finish
was
dry
and
even
a
little
grainy
it
really
belied
its
8
abv
i
found
it
entirely
drinkable
and
would
probably
have
to
be
careful
with
it
given
its
subtleness
di
like
this
stuffi
only
have
3
bottles
of
it
so
im
gonna
drink
em
real
slow
i
may
have
had
this
beer
a
long
time
ago
when
i
wasnt
a
ba
ide
buy
it
again
but
there
are
other
choices
that
i
wanna
try
first
not
too
bad
its
a
well
done
beer
for
sure
but
not
one
im
rushing
out
to
try
this
one
again
along
with
the
esa
my
favorite
of
the
yards
offerings
would
love
to
try
this
from
a
beer
engine
the
second
of
the
ales
of
the
revolution
ive
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
on
tap
at
home
pours
a
darkish
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
no
nose
to
speak
of
but
the
taste
is
delightful
very
well
balanced
sweetness
and
bitterness
and
alcohol
what
alcohol
youd
never
guess
this
was
an
8
brew
and
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
the
flavor
its
thick
enough
and
rich
enough
but
not
so
rich
as
to
fill
you
up
and
prevent
you
from
getting
another
i
will
definitely
have
this
beer
on
tap
again
very
highly
recommended
and
props
to
yards
for
another
fine
instigation
to
revolution
if
youve
ever
had
smuttynoses
wheat
wine
from
their
big
beer
series
thats
comparable
to
tjs
tavern
ale
otherwise
not
bad
theres
also
some
honey
in
it
i
believe
d
at
first
the
alcohol
taste
hit
but
then
the
hops
and
malts
combine
to
make
for
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
recommend
trying
one
even
if
its
not
your
usual
style
beer
on
tap
this
beer
poured
to
a
goldencopper
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissappeared
the
aromas
were
of
caramelmalt
and
hops
the
flavor
was
also
very
hoppy
with
a
medium
to
light
body
in
the
beer
i
personally
thought
this
beer
was
oknot
a
great
standout
though
maybe
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
at
another
time
what
i
love
best
is
its
drinkablility
this
is
an
8
beer
but
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
they
did
a
remarkable
job
of
making
a
great
tasting
classic
beer
that
puts
you
on
the
floor
right
quick
hazy
copper
topped
with
a
thick
white
head

strange
sugary
sweetness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
entirely
hidden
dryness
is
nice
but
the
grain
is
a
bit
overbearing
kinda
feels
like
rye
bread
in
the
aftertaste
lingers
forever
good
thing
im
a
fan
of
rye
bread
not
the
smoothest
but
its
decent
and
tasty
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
is
this
what
beer
was
like
back
then
odd
still
beats
bud
by
a
long
shot
drinkability
and
overall
at
first
i
didnt
quite
know
how
to
take
this
beer
but
now
i
really
like
it
its
very
intersting
and
unique
for
sure
but
its
also
quite
tasty
definitly
recommended
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different

a

spicey
just
not
really
floral
or
sweet
all
of
that
is
left
for
the
malt
you
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
but
the
body
is
good
and
this
is
very
sessionable
but
at
10
a
sixer
around
these
parts
i
dont
drink
it
very
often
m
d
mouthfeel
is
smoothness
that
makes
you
wonder
what
type
of
beer
it
is
i
thought
maybe
an
altbier
or
a
bitter
drinkability
is
real
nicegonna
work
on
the
six
pack
tonight
had
a
bunch
of
these
while
i
was
at
the
city
tavern
for
dinner
about
a
year
ago
the
rabbit
was
wonderful
into
the
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
brown
almost
dark
honey
not
much
of
a
head
but
a
think
white
foam
across
the
top
smell
isnt
too
potent
somewhat
average
lightly
malty
and
fruity
it
has
an
nice
balanced
flavor
mild
malts
with
a
little
spicy
hops
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
i
can
definatley
drink
a
sixer
appeared
a
deep
orange
color
atop
which
sat
a
quickly
dissipating
12
finger
head
slightly
cloudy
and
no
carbonation
apparent
light
roasted
malt
aroma
with
grainy
background
very
pleasant
toasted
feeling
on
the
tongue
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
perfectly
balanced
and
a
good
aftertaste
a
nice
tingling
about
the
tongue
if
jefferson
really
drank
this
beer
no
wonder
he
went
chasing
after
sally
hemmings
a
wonderful
brew
poured
a
deep
peach
color
with
nice
longlasting
head
that
stayed
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
fruity
with
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
supremely
smooth
with
a
nice
fruity
texture
finish
is
moderately
dry
and
absolutley
enjoyable
this
is
a
geat
beer
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
they
put

here

as

honestly
especed
more

but
it
never

i
did
like
the
sweet

sour

mixing
the
obvious
alchohol
notes
they
played
well
off
each

i
am
not
sure
if
thomas
jefferson
formulated
this
recipe
after
his
tour
of
paris
as
ambassador
but
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
he
did
come
up
with
this
beer
after
visiting
some
belgian
or
dutch
tavern
after
making
landfall
in
europe
bottle
describes
this
as
a
strong
golden
ale
emphasis
should
be
on
the
word
strong
the
aroma
lets
you
know
right
away
that
the
gloves
are
off
up
front
hops
bite
in
with
a
nonaromatic
bittering
that
coats
the
tongue
and
up
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
some
malt
sweetness
struggles
to
break
through
but
a
wall
of
hops
bittering
blocks
most
progress
8
abv
shouts
out
it
presence
throughout
if
this
is
what
the
founding
fathers
were
drinking
it
is
a
wonder
they
were
able
to
sign
the
declaration
of
independence
interesting
but
in
the
long
run
a
bit
too
heavy
handed
wins
the
coolest

award
though
great
ale
highly
recomended
poures
a
deep
burnt
orange
with
a
huge
billowing

that
really
takes
its
time

pick
up
some
lemon
rind
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
belgina
like
spicinessnot
sure
what
kinda
yeast
is
used
here
but
man
i
get
like
a
spiceyyeastiness
in
the
aromas
very
unexpected
wow
nice
mingling
of
flavors
very
citrusy
and
lemony
upfront
with
that
underlying
spiciness
but
finishes
with
a
dry
toastiness
with
just
a
tad
bit
of
alcohol
burn
as
it
warms
very
interesting
and
unique
ale
here
is
this
what
one
of
our
greatest
forfathers
was
brewing
at
monticellothe
bottle
says
so
damn
i
wish
i
could
have
shook
his
handjust
great
poured
from
a
nicely
designed
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
small
white
head
the
liquid
is
viscous
in
appearance
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
fruity
tones
the
beers
flavor
starts
malty
and
sweet
with
biscuity
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
grainy
bitter
finish
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
finish
is
lingering
and
a
bit
solventy
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
smooth
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
but
too
much
alcohol
burn
and
malt
sweetness
to
drink
much
of
it
im
reviewing
this
for
what
it
is
and
its
really
not
an
american
pale
ale
and
not
really
fitting
in
any
style
guidelines
id
call
it
a
american
strong
amber
ale
poured
with
a
huge
rocky
pillowy
white
head
on
a
slighlty
hazy
orangey
honeyish
color

hoppy
aroma
very
citrusy
with
some
sugarmalt
sweetness
and
a
bready
yeasty
character
develops
as
this
warms
up
very
very
smooth
body
and
a
slick

mouthfeel
sweet

very
well
defined

character
with
a
dry

very
highly
drinkable
not
a
great
beer
and
its
pretty
expensive
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
ales
of

love
this
kind

this
is
a
very
well
crafted
ale
and
highly
drinkable
watch
your
step
with
this
one
or
you
might
be
trying
to
purchase
large
tracts
of
property
from
naive
french
royals
or
potentates
another
pretty
bottle
from
the
yards
brewery
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
dies
down
fairly
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
little
maltiness
to
it
but
the
floral
hops
were
very
present
there
is
a
nice
citrus
hint
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
had
some
caramel
malt
and
citrus
finishes
a
little
dry
and
leaves
an
interesting
flavor
on
the
palate
i
would
have
this
one
again
this
one
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
just
a
cover
of
head
that
falls
to
nothing
the
nose
is
orange
but
without
the
acid
of
citrus
in
there
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
on
par
with
an
earthy
hop
flavor
pf
an
apa
the
hop
could
be
more
prevalent
but
it
works
okay
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
beers
i
dig
it
faint
apricot
color
with
a
disappearing
offwhite
head
aroma
of
biscuity
malt
not
too
sweet
with
some
fruit
and
a
touch
of
cinammon
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
leading
to
flavors
of
bitter
orange
peel
hops
followed
by
a
strong
bitter
alcohol
flavor
the
alcohol
is
too
overpowering
i
think
i
feel
fumes
going
up
the
back
of
my
throat
and
stinging
the
back
of
my
nose
its
actually
making
me
sneeze
no
other
depth
of
character
or
flavor
definitely
rough
around
the
edges
here
with
the
alcohol
potency
and
i
think
id
need
a
few
to
grease
the
chute
before
really
getting
into
this
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
12
light
beige
head
over
the
dark
amber
brew
head
is
longlasting
with
foamy
lacing
here
and
there
aroma
is
relatively
hoppy
but
somewhat
spicy
as
well
hits
me
like
cinnamon
taste
is
pretty
hardy
malts
for
an
apa
and
the
spices
are
kicking
as
well
makes
you
almost
forget
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
hoppy
offering
which
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
okay
nearing
good
a
bit
too
exotic
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
areas
for
me
to
make
an
enjoyable
apa
almost
seems
like
it
should
be
in
with
the
spiced
ales
or
something
worth
a
try
for
variety
but
not
an
everyday
for
sure
had
this
at
the
city
tavern
had
asked
what
they
had
that
was
the
strongestheaviest
and
was
told
by
one
of
the
guys
that
this
had
more
body
to
it
than
the
george
washington
stout
kinda
surprising
dark
honey
golden
with
a
white
creamy
head
tons
of
lacing
dont
see
the
carbination
too
much
but
it
is
there
in
the
taste
hoppy
scents
light
pine
bit
of
fruitcup
little
bit
of
grapefruit
nice
biteyness
alot
of
carb
in
the
taste
bit
too
much
maybe
yeah
to
me
light
grapefruit
juice
and
hops
little
bit
of
sweetness
that
jumps
from
the
background
good
alcohol
taste
i
like
that
decent
brew
not
one
i
would
go
back
especially
for
12
ounce
bottle
pours
an
amber
copper
color
with
a
carefully
poured
pillow
of
beige
head
faint
tones
of
some
american
grassy
loweralpha
hops
and
some
caramelly
malts
reasonably
well
balanced
swayed
a
slight
bit
towards
the
maltier
side
evidence
of
a
mixture
of
some
paler
and
amber
malts
with
botanical
hops
in
the
background
pretty
darn
drinkable
im
taking
a
fondness
of
the
revolutionary
era
recipes
that
yards
is
reproducing
now
if
we
could
only
get
a
john
quincy
adams
unadulterated
gruit
ale
in
the
lineup
golden
and
glistening
this
beer
leaves
thick
rings
of
lacing
around
a
pint
glass
on
the
first
taste
the
hops
seemed
a
little
overwhelming
but
after
a
few
sips
everything
seemed
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
there
are
hints
of
sweetness
and
fruit
especially
in
the
aftertaste
which
lingers
a
long
time
on
the
tongue
well
done
yards
i
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
city
tavern
this
beer
was
very
uninspiring
and
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
undercarbonation
left
it
with
a
flat
feel
in
the
mouth
it
coated
the
mouth
in
a
bad
way
wheaty
taste
but
not
much
hops
to
be
found
it
looked
great
in
the
glass
with
a
moderate
head
very
hazy
amber
with
a
thinning
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
a
little
bite
of
almost
peppery
hops
i
really
was
a
bit
surprised
that
the
beer
was
as
strong
as
it
is
its
pretty
drinkable
toasted
bread
is
the
base
of
the
malt
in
the
flavor
this
could
pass
for
a
decent
esb
drinkable
a
great
brew
and
an
interesting
pale
ale
backwash
if
this
is
indeed
authentic
i
can
see
why
the
founding
fathers
were
braver
smarter
and
more
innovative
than
the
statesmen
of
today
this
comes
pretty
close
to
the
kind
of
beer
ive
often
dreamed
of
brewing
or
drinking
a
double
or
extra
strong
esb
in
any
event
its
definitely
more
than
a
pale
ale
this
sacrifices
very
little
for
its
higher
abv
maintaining
a
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
and
a
very
nice
drinkability
i
dont
know
exactly
why
this
is
quite
so
expensive
but
i
have
to
say
that
much
of
the
cost
shows
up
in
the
glass
so
im
much
less
likely
to
quibble
about
it
maybe
its
because
i
let
this
sit
for
awhile
before
getting
around
to
drinking
them
and
they
improved
but
i
was
genuinely
surprised
that
more
people
didnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
poured
from
a
tap
at

in
phila
the
second
try
of
yards
beers
of
the
revolution
another
good
beer
that
is
a
dark
auburn
color
with
a
small
white
shortlasting
head
the
beer
was
strangely
dull
in
aroma
we
were
drinking
at
an
outside
table
and
its
possible
the
outdoor
aromas
overpowered
the
beer
but
what
aroma
existed
was
primarily
one
of
malt
the
beer
fortunately
has
a
lot
more
taste
than
aroma
it
is
a
rather
complex
ale
with
a
basic
sweet
maltiness
base
with
fruity
overtones
the
beer
has
a
hops
kick
at
the
end
that
lends
a
bitterness
that
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
it
has
a
thick
and
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
and
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
begs
for
a
second
somewhat
thick
and
fairly
heavily
carbonated
a
very
nice
quaff
thanks
to
beerluvr
for
this
great
ale
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
strong
pale
malt
scent
with
some
light
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
yet
intense
pale
malt
flavor
that
finishes
dry
and
bitter
with
a
bit
of
a
breadlike
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
it
has
a
little
too
much
abv
but
it
is
still
quite
enjoyable
a
big
thick
offwhitemocha
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
remains
substantial
leaving
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
the
color
is
slightly
darker
and
more
orange
hued
than
your
average
pale
the
aroma
is
earthy
like
farm
air
after
a
storm
with
a
hop
bitterness
that
bites
the
nose
lightly
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
syrupy
with
a
carbonated
tingle
that
compliments
the
hop
aspect
of
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
clean
but
filling
substantial
in
its
delivery
of
a
nicely
blended
citrussweet
malt
bitter
flavor
quite
enjoyable
and
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
another
beer
i
had
at
the
city

in
philly
it
is
a
cloudy
orangebrown
color
decent
sized
head
and
fruity
and
floral
aroma
with
some
sour
notes
it
is
malty
and
i
think
they
said
that
honey
is
used
and
i
detect
a
slight
amount
of
it
it
finishes
with
a
crisp
hoppines
and
a
slight
sour
dryness
quite
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
the
malt
rides
the
tongue
for
a
few
seconds
after
swallowing
carbonation
is
quite
light
medium
bodied
and
can
be
considered
a
hearty
ale

a
chilled

peach

thin
offwhite

faded
quickly
some

and
smaller
patches
of

off
a
kind
of
fruitiness
of
nectarine
red

and
very
slight
caramel
taste
has
a
very
dullish
malt
profile
slightly
chewy
smooth
and
malted
up
like
crazy
wheres
the
hops
seems
more
like
all
malts
to
me
but
i
guess
the
hops
could
be
adding
to
some
of
the
dryer
dulled
citrus
tones
that
are
coming
through
late
along
with
a
tiny
woodish
note
in
the
finish
theres
a
very
tiny
spice
and
floral
tone
coming
through
as
it
warms
nearer
the
finish
feel
is
close
to
medium
and
quite
smooth
with
a
milder
tone
of
malts
and
just
a
nudge
of
carbonation
and
husklike
texture
midway
to
finish
this
was
a
bit
more
malts
then
i
like
my
pales
like
em
much
more
hopped
up
andor
at

balanced
evenly
between
the
two
but
this
was
nice
enough

me

to
francisweizen

throwing
this

large
tufts
of
foam
on
the

its
a

more
attractive

id
expected

a
lingering
spiciness
its
remarkably
drinkable
and
all
around
quite
good
i
wonder
if
this
actually
resembles
the
brews
of
colonial
and
revolutionary
times
fill
my
blackjack
wasnt
entirely
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
pour
was
nice
with
a
very
thick
head
developing
quickly
and
dissapating
slowly
smell
was
understated
with
a
bit
of
citrus
lemon
notes
coming
through
the
payoff
was
in
the
taste
very
meaty
for
a
pale
ale
lots
of
bright
notes
in
the
beer
again
a
lemoncitrus
zing
rings
through
for
me
hops
are
present
but
not
overpowering
as
is
the
malt
very
different
from
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
this
one
down
it
hides
the
8
abv
very
well
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
over
dinner
very
drinkable
deep
copper
color
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
sweet
and
hints
at
familiar
bourbon
nuances
a
bit
of
smoky
oak
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
carmelized
sugar
the
taste
is
rather
earthy
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
strong
resurgent
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
is
also
present
on
the
finish
lingering
woody
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
makes
me
feel
like
im
using
the
old
wooden
drinking
vessels
of
colonial
america
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
robust
but
not
overpowering
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
strong
earthiness
combined
with
the
alcohol
drop
it
down
a
notch
in
my
book
nonetheless
a
pleasant
find
and
another
creative
beer
idea
brought
to
you
by
the
folks
at
yards
ales
of
the
revolution
sounds
interesting
enough
the
tavern
ale
pours
with
an
offwhite
medium
sized
head
that
retains
a
mild
stickiness
the
body
is
orangeamber
in
colour
and
looks
to
be
a
bit
high
in
the
carbonation
department
perhaps
a
nice
crisp
pale
ale
awaits
the
smell
is
somewhat
decent
here
seems
like
its
going
to
be
a
bit
thin
in
the
flavour
and
body
department
from
smell
alone
there
are
hints
of
sweetness
earth
wood
and
malt
here
the
taste
improves
upon
the
smell
though
not
by
much
it
is
more
bitter
than
the
smell
would
lead
to
believe
and
has
a
nice
earthhop
balance
to
it
still
seems
watery
but
less
so
than
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
the
carbonation
evened
out
as
well
once
the
beer
sat
for
a
while
it
actually
ended
up
being
rather
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
one
is
not
bad
not
great
just
a
decent
to
good
brew
im
actually
hoping
for
better
things
from
the
washington
porter
but
could
easily
drink
this
one
again
and
would
not
mind
it
at
all
for
a
session
brew
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
if
im
ever
in
a
bar
in
philly
this
one
pours
with
a
rocky
just
offwhite
head
settling
with
awesome
lacing
over
hazy
sunset
amber
liquid
theres
apparent
fruitiness
in
the
nose
with
lightly
toasted
maltiness
sneaking
in
as
well
the
taste
offers
rich
mouthfeel
with
lingering
hoppy
undercurrents
mixed
with
yeasty
fruitiness
malty
sugars
and
a
bit
of
warming
alcoholic
heft
finishes
toasty
fruity
and
bitter
those
colonial
boys
sure
drank
some
good
ale
back
in
the
day
another
superb
offering
in
the
ales
of
the
revolution
series
a
nice
pale
ale
thats
more
malty
than
most
were
there
not
hops
in
colonial
america
and
certainly
one
that
i
would
have
in
the
future
dark
peach
with
a
small
white
head
the
aromas
are
of
fruit
booze
melons
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
of
hops
fruit
and
booze
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
finish
is
warming
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
interesting
ale
as
well
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
sample
unfortunately
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
from
yards
oh
well
its
still
tasty
and
very
different
appearance
pours
a
glowing
golden
amber
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
cream
colored
head
leaves
thick
patches
of
evenly
strung
lacing
aroma
nice
floral
and
herb
like
hop
dosage
very
nice
flow
overall
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
supporting
sweetness
here
taste
suprisingly
more
alcohol
than
i
was
expecting
with
some
sweet
gingery
bread
notes
and
a
load
of
hops
crashing
down
on
the
palate
this
isnt
half
bad
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
yards
brews
but
this
one
named
after
ol
tommy
j
is
a
contender
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
ale
decent
carbonation
but
for
whatever
reason
its
a
bit
cloying
with
some
alcohol
notes
in
the
end
drinkability
decent
strong
golden
ale
not
a
beer
that
would
get
me
hooked
but
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
give
it
a
try
smooth
and
rich
with
very
light
carbonation
this
one
has
a
lot
of
body
and
flavor
the
hops
and
apricots
start
you
off
with
a
somewhat
earthy
flavor
it
slightly
reminds
me
of
the
hop
flavor
of
a
real
ale
i
had
on
cask
which
one
i
can
not
remember
the
alcohol
produces
a
little
bite
but
it
is
welcomed
it
adds
a
nice
warming
effect
too
some
big
spices
come
in
with
a
piney
finish
to
really
give
you
a
kick
in
the
pants
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
although
the
porter
could
have
used
a
bunch
of
work
this
one
is
a
bit
closer
to
a
great
beer
i
am
still
curious
why
this
series
of
beers
costs
an
extra
6
above
their
normal
6pack
prices
i
would
just
as
well
stick
with
their
regular
line
up
and
trubbel
de
yards
the
ben
franklin
special
ale
along
with
the
george
washington
porter
and
the
thomas
jefferson
ale
are
all
from
yards
brewing
co
and
are
brewed
exclusively
for
the
city
tavern
in
olde
city
in
philadelphia
this
beer
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
if
your
in
the
area
this
beer
is
only
available
at
the
city
tavern
in
philadelphia
it
was
originally
brewed
by
dock
street
to
a
recipe
based
on
records
of
what
was
purchased
for
the
brewing
at
monticello
the
appearance
is
crystal
clear
unusual
for
a
yards
product
and
id
guess
the
city
tavern
may
be
insisting
its
being
filtered
as
there
is
no
sediment
in
the
bottle
with
a
very
nice
deep
orangecopper
color
showing
orange
and
ruby
highlights
the
head
is
offwhite
and
needs
to
be
coaxed
a
litttle
but
builds
a
fairly
dense
14
head
once
thinned
the
whispy
head
lasts
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
belgianlace
the
nose
is
mainly
fruity
with
some
caramel
malt
in
the
background
and
some
earthymineral
notes
although
there
are
few
hops
to
speak
of
the
flavor
is
far
more
malty
than
the
aroma
suggests
but
not
very
complex
however
once
coupled
with
the
rich
fruity
flavors
its
fairly
interesting
theres
also
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
involved
but
its
well
hidden
the
taste
ends
with
a
gently
spicy
dryness
and
hop
bitterness
that
eases
away
like
the
setting
sun
similar
in
many
ways
to
their
ipa
well
worth
trying
a
beer
that
becons
you
to
keep
tasting
overall
this
is
definitely
the
best
of
coopers
beers
with
their
best
extra
stout
taking
a
close
second
a
complex
and
easydrinking
beer
for
either
a
session
or
chilling
with
for
a
halfhour
they
cellar
for
a
number
of
years
too
and
can
improve
with
age
well
worth
the
au83
for
a
case
of
24
x
375ml
fruity
apples
and
apricots
easy
drinking
hazy
amber
colour
big
head
and
big
lace
smell
is
very
faint
apples
i
think
and
caramel
medium
body
and
correct
carbonation
taste
of
fruits
apples
and
apricots
easily
drinkable
but
i
dont
feel
nothing
special
in
this
one
2009
vintage
aged
4
years
o
cannot
recommend
this
old
style
ale
despite
its
fine
aroma
o
very
tasty
and
easy
dinking
leaves
me
thirsty
after
each
sip
a
good
quality
beer
that
is
the
best
in
the
coopers
range
will
be
interesting
to
taste
again
in
a
year
or
two
overall
cellared
from
beer
of
the
month
club
this
beer
has
mellowed
throughout
the
cellaring
process
however
i
dont
believe
this
has
benefited
the
beer
not
as
developed
as
i
had
hoped
for
this
style
o
nice
easy
drinker
good
beer
the
end
the
day
with
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
malt
caramel
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
overall
a
decent
thicker
english
brew
definitely
one
which
you
need
to
step
back
and
reevaluate
before
making
a
decision
im
intrigued
by
the
sediment
sitting
on
top
of
the
thin
film
of
white
by
the
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
and
the
bitter
yet
malty
sweet
taste
on
the
palate
afterward
i
did
like
this
beer
not
too
heavy
still
flavorful
and
hoppy
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
if
i
drank
it
in
another
couple
of
years
or
younger
though
after
3
years
it
showed
up
as
a
great
beer
maybe
at
its
peak
o
the
side
of
the
bottle
did
say
to
pour
with
care
because
there
is
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
pour
first
and
read
second
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
beers
in
a
sitting
overall
a
pleasant
beer
and
i
would
buy
again
coopers
ales
and
stout
are
brewed
using
the
centuries
old
top
fermentation
method
and
natural
bottle
conditioning
resulting
in
a
characteristic
fine
sediment
forming
on
the
base
of
the
bottle
this
sediment
is
completely
natural
and
can
be
gently
mixed
before
stinking
or
poured
carefully
leaving
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
this
is
the
2008
vintage
that
i
have
been
aging
in
my
cellar
for
a
few
years
now
poured
into
a
brooklyn
brewery
snifter
i
was
extremely
careful
to
not
pour
the
thick
sediment
into
the
glass
great
amount
of
carbonation
with
excellent
lacing
garnet
ruby
red
body
with
orange
highlights
very
nice
looking
beer
smell
was
earthy
and
yeasty
taste
was
very
pleasurable
malt
raisins
toffee
and
fresh
bread
were
highlights
mouthfeel
was
the
biggest
surprise
so
extra
points
here
it
held
up
well
over
the
time
in
the
cellar
and
it
was
mighty
smooth
if
i
could
go
back
i
would
definitely
buy
a
few
more
for
a
mere
3
each
and
age
some
for
5
years
and
beyond
just
to
see
if
it
can
get
better
but
its
pretty
great
tasting
at
4
years
no
doubt
conclusion
very
nice
at
2
years
and
at
4
could
it
go
longer
yes
i
think
it
could
but
not
past
5
or
so
years
and
not
without
good
cellar
conditions
i
really
enjoyed
seeing
this
evolve
into
something
good
but
different
now
i
want
to
taste
it
fresh
o
an
interesting
beer
to
have
tried
o
somewhat
disappointed
in
this
too
hot
and
spritzy
for
what
it
offers
in
terms
of
flavour
and
complexity
i
knew
i
should
be
suspicious
of
a
5yearold
beer
in
a
twist
top
there
are
the
whiskey
notes
of
a
mature
strong
ale
yes
but
the
whole
thing
is
thin
flat
and
one
dimensional
without
even
worrying
if
its
a
bit
stale
not
the
best
from
coopers
or
oz
over
all
this
is
a
nice
vintage
ale
well
cellared
leans
towards
a
barley
wine
style
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
other
beers
in
the
coopers
fleet
of
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
as
it
is
exceptional
and
is
a
great
treat
i
didnt
age
this
one
these
09
bottles
were
purchased
yesterday
a
letdown
sixpack
purchase
never
having
had
it
fresh
i
have
nothing
to
compare
them
to
and
considering
whats
here
now
theres
no
reason
to
let
these
sit
any
longer
3
5
overall
interesting
but
cant
say
i
am
desiring
this
again
o
not
bad
but
not
overly
interesting
very
well
balanced
though
2009
vintage
so
something
like
two
or
three
years
old
at
this
point
great
burnt
orange
hue
nice
head
that
settles
down
into
a
thin
layer
of
foamy
bubbles
that
never
go
all
the
way
away
lots
of
malty
sweetness
on
the
nose
some
wood
some
dark
fruit
the
taste
follows
the
smell
fairly
closely
but
the
good
news
is
that
the
wood
and
fruit
flavors
come
on
strong
and
it
is
not
just
a
simple
malt
bomb
well
crafted
and
well
cellared
beer
here
the
only
hint
at
the
strength
of
this
beer
is
the
association
of
the
flavors
with
high
gravity
brews
im
not
really
picking
up
any
alcohol
heat
maintains
surprisingly
good
carbonation
unsure
if
the
liveliness
is
appropriate
here
or
not
but
i
for
one
appreciate
it
definitely
adds
another
dimension
to
the
beer
nice
and
full
bodied
without
being
viscous
or
too
sticky
altogether
not
a
beer
i
was
sure
i
would
like
and
certainly
one
that
exceeded
my
expectations

o
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
give
it
an
average
because
im
on
the
fence
overall
with
this
beer
which
is
how
i
feel
about
most
average
beers
o
4
overall
this
beer
is
rough
around
the
edges
in
some
ways
its
strength
and
the
forwardness
of
its
alcohol
flavors
impinge
on
its
drinkability
however
that
is
clearly
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
extra
strong
i
rather
like
it
again
a
gentle
pour
but
this
time
with
just
wisps
for
head
and
a
deepamber
color
with
just
the
hint
of
haze
nose
had
a
more
pronounced
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
fuller
and
more
carbonated
suggesting
that
fresher
may
be
better
especially
in
this
case
the
taste
was
more
pronounced
as
opposed
to
aged
and
i
really
caught
the
interaction
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
toffee
was
prevalent
but
not
overwhelming
on
the
tongue
this
was
actually
quite
pleasant
where
the
previous
vintage
was
more
of
a
challenge
finish
was
very
caramel
very
fitting
for
christmasween
o
a
very
drinkable
ale
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
interest
i
think
the
bottled
version
is
slightly
better
o
this
is
not
as
strong
as
i
had
hoped
but
the
fruitiness
is
very
pleasant
mouth
feel
was

style
but
have
a
pretty
good
and
different
taste
you
will
want
to
try
this
and
the
price
isnt
to
bad
either
o
this
was
really
quite
tasty
with
3
years
of
age
on
it
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
for
comparison
sake
overall
this
seems
a
little
bit
young
or
green
maybe
best
to
sit
on
for
a
little
while
food
match
rich
game
meats
like
venison
or
kangaroo
in
fact
a
grilled
roo
steak
with
roasted
vegetables
and
a
dark
chocolate
sauce
would
go
down
a
treat
with
this
poured
an
ambercopper
color
very
light
tan
head
but
it
doesnt
stay
long
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
malty
and
caramel
that
carries
over
well
into
the
taste
though
it
has
a
slight
bitter
edge
and
more
nuttiness
feels
pretty
good
medium
bodied
a
tad
creamy
and
sick
low
carbonation
no
real
booziness
to
it
so
it
drinks
easy
enough
but
its
just
nothing
too
spectacular
decent
enough
though
may
sit
on
a
bottle
for
a
while
as
a
comparison
i
had
a
2007
around
six
months
ago
that
i
almost
though
of
as
a
perfect
beer
and
would
have
almost
gone
5s
or
4
5s
across
the
scoreboard
board
on
such
an
integrated
christmas
cake
sweetness
to
the
flavour
that
was
to
die
for
o
so
clearly
this
is
the
pick
of
the
coopers
stable
although
it
has
a
price
to
match
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
proof
that
australians
can
make
a
decent
beer
when
we
try
overall
this
tastes
very
much
like
a
english
barley
wine
it
was
very
good
and
at
a
real
good
price
11
bucks
canadian
for
a
6
pack
coors
light
6
packs
cost
around
the
same
amount
so
i
fought
it
a
awesome
deal
drinkability
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
in
general
but
still
goodtasting
and
complexintriguing
very
decent
brew
a
somewhat
plain
vintage
ale
kind
of
flabby
all
around
the
wellintegrated
abv
helps
in
making
this
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
just
doesnt
grab
my
attention
the
staid
essence
of
english
heritage
perhaps
my
bias
to
bear
first
sip
confirms
my
suspicion
this
smell
tastes
a
lot
like
an
americanstyle
scotch
alewee
heavy
which
is
good
because
i
am
currently
in
love
with
the
style
namelylake
louies
warped
speed
and
its
kinda
turned
into
my
goto
beer
this
winter
a
rustic
sweetness
characterized
by
roasted
caramel
with
a
chilled
out
bitterness
gives
my
mouth
a
full
flavored
yet
super
easy
drinking
experience
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
drank
it
too
fast
ive
had
this
a
few
times
over
the
years
but
ive
never
held
on
to
one
for
more
than
a
yeardrank
one
older
than
a
year
and
maybe
next
time
ill
give
that
a
go
at
1
year
or
less
its
good
but
may
be
potentially
beter
this
beer
is
probably
the
best
australia
has
to
offer
beerwise
coopers
is
a
brewery
which
ive
ways
felt
was
a
tad
not
right
maybe
its
those
50s
labels
on
the
sparkling
and
pale
ales
i
think
if
they
gave
their
labels
a
makeover
they
could
be
an
australian
unibroue
drinkability
nice
beer
would
definitely
have
another
quite
heavy
and
fruity
so
not
a
session
beer
might
suit
a
cider
drinker
better
also
quite
potent
in
terms
of
alcohol
nice
to
slowly
sip
and
let
it
warm
and
expand
d
im
not
gonna
lie
this
brew
goes
down
nice
and
easy
but
it
feels
filling
so
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
would
not
seek
this
out
in
the
future
d
not
the
most
drinable
style
but
i
could
have
a
couple
in
an
evening
though
d
not
bad
but
a
little
to
week
in
smell
age
it
to
perfection
not
bad
but
honing
the
sharpness
and
increase
the
earthiness
would
improve
it
imho
drink
on
the
bottle
they
talk
about
how
ageable
and
delicious
this
beer
is
and
honestly
i
wish
it
was
after
two
years
it
hasnt
held
up
at
all
maybe
its
a
shipping
thing
or
it
wasnt
properly
stored
but
for
16
a
six
pack
i
feel
ripped
off
o
quite
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
deliver
something
special
a
bottle
left
on
the
shelf
will
maybe
change
my
opinion
later
years
this
beer
should
probably
be
cellared
for
a
few
years
but
as
it
is
now
i
have
a
hard
time
seing
that
it
would
have
any
chance
to
become
more
than
average
a
decent
strong
ale
i
think
i
prefer
it
fresh
but
this
isnt
bad
d
carbonation
hurt
the
drinkability
of
this
really
over
carbonated
flavors
and
the
texture
are
pretty
good
though
this
could
develop
into
a
really
good
beer
in
time
have
an
09
in
my
cellar
and
should
have
reviewed
that
one
will
hold
off
on
trying
a
10
again
for
at
least
a
year
i
keep
trying
to
appreciate
this
beer
more
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
i
do
appreciate
that
its
well
made
though
pours
an
unfiltered
copper
with
a
thick
cap
of
offwhite
and
attractive
head
clearly
bottle
conditioned
though
with
a
bit
of
chunkiness
to
the
yeast
aromas
of
caramel
alcohol
grapes
honey
and
maple
predominate
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
there
somewhere
flavor
has
lots
of
syrupy
malt
quite
estery
some
floral
malts
some
solvent
alcohol
finish
is
very
dry
with
some
maple
malt
and
grassy
hops
feel
is
nicely
thick
but
carbonation
seems
over
the
top
which
is
the
norm
from
coopers
it
would
seem
this
is
a
fair
strong
ale
without
much
standout
character
taste
quite
a
disappointment
i
think
perhaps
it
didnt
have
a
malty
enough
body
to
stand
up
to
2
years
of
aging
earthy
herbal
hops
and
a
decent
bitterness
in
the
finish
2009
batch
sampled
on
may
6
2010
it
pours
a
handsome
but
somewhat
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
long
lasting
luscious
looking
fluffy
head
and
excellent
clinging
lacing
but
the
most
noticeable
aspect
is
all
of
the
sedimentary
deposits
swimming
around
the
glass
it
is
significant
as
a
home
brew
caramel
malts
is
the
first
sensation
in
the
aroma
followed
quickly
by
a
pine
tree
raisiny
background
and
a
crisp
fresh
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
bold
with
the
bits
of
sediments
tickling
the
tongue
the
overall
impression
of
the
taste
is
a
kind
of
biterness
with
a
dose
of
hard
liquor
but
the
sweet
malts
and
dry
hoppy
finish
are
also
notable
it
is
complex
but
delightful
i
can
happily
announce
that
this
is
the
first
austrailian
beer
i
actually
really
enjoyed
and
would
actively
look
for
again
d
good
flavor
but
not
an
enjoyable
mouthfeel
and
no
one
really
wants
to
watch
floating
bits
sliding
into
their
mouth
from
a
beer
i
understand
drinking
sediment
but
this
is
large
particles
2009
vintage
rusty
orange
with
a
thick
billowy
head
lookin
good
nice
fruity
esters
and
some
hints
of
raisin
and
dried
fruits
a
wonderful
hit
of
rich
bitterness
and
warming
alcohol
in
perfect
balance
very
much
eglish
in
style
like
most
things
coopers
does
quite
moreish
this
is
possibly
the
best
vintage
yet
overall
this
is
pretty
average
the
appearance
risks
being
offputting
and
the
smell
is
unbalanced
the
taste
is
redeeming
but
not
enough
so
that
i
would
seek
this
out
in
the
future
i
enjoyed
it
but
believe
it
to
be
overpriced
in
my
area
of
the
country
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
it
still
is
a
bit
hot
even
2
years
old
it
could
get
better
with
age
though
it
has
the
twist
off
which
is
more
prone
to
oxygenation
overall
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
another
good
offering
from
coopers
to
go
beside
their
fine
export
stout
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
though
the
palate
needs
a
little
beefing
up
to
really
get
it
over
the
hump
one
to
try
if
you
can
find
it
bottle
poured
a
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy

with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing

of
sugar
and
light
subtle
fruity
ester
with
nice
dry

balance
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
caramelized
sugar
with
great
note
light
dry
raisins
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
done
though
additional
complexity
could
have
benefited
this
beer
the
taste
is
bad
thankfully
we
were
splitting
this
and
i
didnt
have
much
to
drink
it
was
bitter
with
bad
hops
the
feel
was
ok
but
not
drinkable
at
all
really
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
theres
certainly
something
a
bit
too
raw
about
it
perhaps
it
mellows
with
age
perhaps
is
becomes
slightly
sweeter
and
the
harsher
notes
become
blunted
maybe
hopefully
2008
poured
a
fairly
clear
tawny
amber
with
an
eggshell
cap
of
fine
bubbles
thick
chunky
lacing
with
good
head
retention
the
sediment
was
quite
loose
meaning
that
it
was
suspended
in
the
last
2oz
or
so
of
beer
even
with
a
careful
pour
fruity
aroma
toffee
bready
ripe
apple
and

skin
malty
texture
a
little
coarse
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
the
body
fell
away
a
little
bit
towards
the
end
leaving
it
a
bit
thin
medium
to
low
bitterness
that
was
more
pronounced
in
the
finish
hops
were
a
bit
grassy
and
herbal
perhaps
minty
and
lingered
on
the
palate
it
was
a
bit
earthy
and
there
was
a
hint
of
anise
midpalate
and
in
the
finish
fruity
character
was
less
prominent
and
seemed
to
be
tied
to
a
light
alcohol
flavour
there
seemed
to
be
a
hint
of
oakwood
as
well
contributing
a
light
astringency
overall
pretty
good
other
than
the
issue
i
had
with
the
body
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
little
lace
a
decent
malt
smell
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
hints
of
hops
has
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
feel
and
while
enjoyable
rather
simple
minor
fruity
hops
mix
with
mild
sweet
malts
for
a
rather
broad
brew
that
is
a
little
prickly
and
has
a
minor
dry
backbite
not
much
in
this
beer
but
it
is
a
good
one
to
try
i
would
have
this
again
though
it
would
be
mooddependent
and
i
wouldnt
pass
up
an
opportunity
to
see
what
else
this
brewery
can
do
still
this
makes
me
interested
in
trying
more
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
fairly
easy
to
drink
the
abv
doesnt
really
come
out
worth
a
try
sometime
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
if
not
an
odd
style
i
would
consider
more
on
the
light
side
of
a
barleywine
its
been
aged
as
evident
by
the
oxidation
but
it
just
doesnt
reach
the
level
of
complexity
one
might
expect
from
a
strong
ale
nonetheless
it
is
worth
trying
but
you
probably
dont
need
to
get
too
excited
about
it
nice
old
ale
id
buy
it
if
i
see
it
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
at
that
i
could
see
me
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
denjoyable
ale
solid
beer
drinkability
really
just
kind
of
strange
for
an
english
style
ale
however
i
definitely
do
enjoy
it
i
just
cant
see
myself
returning
to
it
too
often
not
bad
definitely
a
strong
ale
of
sorts
not
as
strong
as
the
american
cousin
and
slightly
closer
to
an
english
barleywine
albeit
not
quite
d
pretty
tasty
but
kind
of
green
i
should
have
waited
to
open
this
interesting
brew
not
one
to
drink
steadily
but
an
ok
experience
mouthfeel
medium
and
smooth
with
fairly
heavy
carbonation
alcohol
presence
becomes
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
fairly
good
but
lends
itself
to
sipping
notes
this
review
is
for
a
2002
vintage
tasted
in
2002
this
is
easy
to
drink
with
enough
going
on
to
keep
interest
a
nice
smoothness
and
abv
very
wellcovered
this
is
there
2009
vintage
and
it
pours
a
deep
mahoganyhoneyish
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
nice
one
finger
headit
has
aromas
of
freshly
baked
breadyeasty
malty
notes
and
suprisingly
some
fruity
notes
too
quite
impressive
for
coopersit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
and
from
my
first
sip
i
know
i
have
just
found
my
favourite
coopers
beer
in
their
range
without
a
doubt
it
has
a
strong
malty
yeast
note
first
up
followed
by
some
light
spicyfruity
hops
and
it
finishes
ever
so
smoothi
honestly
cant
believe
its
taken
me
this
long
to
discover
a
true
australian
beauty
overall
like
papaeugene
i
had
this
one
after
pliny
the
elder
so
i
was
a
bit
sick
and
tired
of
a
very
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
the
main
reason
why
i
couldnt
enjoy
this
beer
as
mentioned
by
papaeugene
for
a
fair
review
i
will
have
to
drink
it
another
time
but
this
is
not
too
high
on
my
beerpriority
list
d
i
guess
a
bad
choice
after
the
hopbomb
pliny
the
elder
to
give
it
a
fair
review
i
would
have
to
drink
this
again
this
vintage
ale
calls
for
aging
however
nothing
in
body
flavors
or
character
could
lead
one
to
conclude
that
aging
will
help
this
dull
simple
and
short
flavored
beer
with
a
fantastic
nose
smell
it
dont
drink
it
just
one
guys
opinion
interesting
beer
got
this
at
sams
in
chicago
last
week
poured
with
a
tan
head
and
a
few
drops
of
dark
sediment
color
is
a
very
hazy
dark
amber
to
brown
nose
is
some
malt
caramel
toffee
nougat
and
varnish
no
lace
and
head
mostly
subsides
quickly
flavor
is
malty
toffee
a
bit
bitter
from
yeastoids
thinner
than
i
would
have
supposed
think
itll
get
much
better
with
some
time
do
pick
up
the
alcohol
good
carbonation
finish
is
ok
this
beer
pours
a
murky
light
amber
color
the
head
is
small
and
vanishes
into
almost
no
lacing
within
seconds
the
aroma
is
burnt
caramel
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
wood
as
if
it
had
some
barrel
aging
to
it
although
i
dont
think
it
does
the
taste
is
very
malty
the
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
come
up
first
with
the
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
rounding
out
the
finish
there
is
no
hint
of
wood
like
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
too
high
for
the
style
and
really
gets
in
the
way
of
the
taste
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
could
drink
it
again
without
any
complaints
but
there
are
a
lot
of
strong
ales
out
there
with
more
complexity
maybe
not
as
unique
and
amazing
as
marketing
tries
to
make
out
this
ale
to
be
i
still
have
this
up
there
as
one
of
my
top
3
english
style
ales
made
in
australia
and
in
general
though
my
experience
with
international
varieties
are
the
more
common
garden
varieties
definitely
will
drink
this
many
times
again
though
its
not
always
quite
this
good
and
the
coopers
sparkling
ale
is
also
very
good
cheaper
and
more
consistent
with
taste
d
this
was
a
vintagedated
bottle
dated
2008
so
i
probably
drank
it
a
bit
too
soon
overall
those
higher
alcohols
were
the
dominating
flavor
in
this
beer
and
were
harsh
at
best
im
thinking
of
buying
a
few
more
bottles
and
seeing
how
it
ages
over
time
as
this
beer
definitely
needs
some
years
to
mellow
out
ill
try
to
come
back
and
rereview
this
beer
once
i
had
the
chance
to
age
a
bottle
for
awhile
2008
vintage
and
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
the
beer
pours
the
colour
of
boot
polish
and
the
nose
is
redolent
of
plums
and
dark
fruits
this
is
a
big
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
but
with
the
typical
coopers
fruitiness
and
soft
finish
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
old
ale
with
all
the
complexities
that
go
with
the
style
it
starts
off
with
a
little
bit
of
sourness
and
finishes
sweet
moderate
carbonation
with
a
slightly
sticky
mouth
feel
overall
it
is
warming
and
shows
some
depth
i
think
this
would
do
better
with
age
the
alcohol
could
mellow
a
bit
loved
this
exceptional
very
nice
taste
rich
and
malty
with
a
hoppy
finish
alcohol
is
mostly
well
hidden
but
there
is
a
bit
of
a
jolt
in
the
middle
its
well
masked
by
the
hops
finds
its
way
a
bit
slowly
through
the
mouth
a
bit
clunky
somehow
this
is
a
very
good
beer
really
impressive
yet
pleasant
and
very
fine
drinking
this
has
to
get
better
with
age
right
as
of
now
it
is
not
very
flavorful

14
inch
head
with
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
strongly
of
alcohol
and
some
strong
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
english
strong
ale
my
first
example
of
this
style
and
if
this
is
any
indication
of
what
others
will
taste
like
im
a
big
fan
has
a
thick
and
slighty
crisp
mouth
feel
there
is
a
bitterness
and
tartness
associated
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malts
strong
malts
slight
hops
and
noticeable
alcohol
content
overall
this
is
a
really
good
sipping
beer
worth
a
try
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
it
pours
a
medium
head
thats
decently
sustained
with
light
lacing
carbonation
is
light
there
is
an
taste
with
a
slight
citrus
almost
woody
with
a
very
tame
and
pleasant
underlying
sweetness
it
is
mediumbodied
and
a
fairly
thick
malty
mouthfeel
the
malt
and
hops
are
very
wellbalanced
and
i
thought
the
taste
was
very
good
i
will
try
this
again
pours
medium
amber
with
offwhite
head
that
retains
fairly
well
nose
kicks
off
with
an
immediate
resemblance
to
ceylon
black
tea
slight
citrus
and
some
metallic
components
as
well
light
bodied
ale
that
is
rather
tame
with
all
flavors
starting
with
soft
malt
and
quickly
balanced
by
the
hops
that
build
well
into
the
finish
not
sure
that
age
will
enhance
this
beer
because
it
seems
that
once
the
hops
mellow
there
isnt
much
left
that
is
contemplative
deep
rusted
amber
with
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
white
head
fades
after
a
minute
or
so
with
minimal
lacing
in
random
spots
pretty
good
nose
fruity
malt
and
an
earthy

slightly
sweet

a
touch

honey

little
sugar
earthy
crisp

a
tiny
bit
thin
but
good
mouthfeel
with
a
good
dry
finish
on
par
with
the
style
i
suppose
not
bad
by
any
means
thanks
to
intriqken
for
a
bottle
of
this
coopers
brew
that
i
havent
seen
in
my
parts
d
ok
but
not
great
strength
and
alcohol
warmth
makes
this
a
good
nightcap
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
little
clarity
develops
a
thin
brownwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
a
small
collar
and
no
laciness
nice
aroma
of
hops
and

me
a

of

light
and
crisp
with
a

around

excellent

in

expected
of

pretty
good
d
not
the
best
beer
kind
of
a
weaker
attempt
at
an
english
ale
for
a
strong
vintage
ale
i
was
expecting
much
more
i
also
dont
see
thi
sbeer
aging
very
well
at
all
it
was
a
warming
brew
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
to
it
solid
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
it
d
good
drinkability
worthy
of
a
try
pretty
tasty
and
big
for
an
australian
beer
the
taste
is
much
worse
and
seems
just
old
acrid
and
flat
it
is
mostly
just
old
leaves
and
apples
with
a
sharp
rough
alcoholic
quality
the
overall
character
is
very
flat
good
but
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
cash
you
have
to
fork
over
for
it
this
is
a
really
nice
strong
full
aussie
strong
ale
well
worth
the
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
there
are
floaties
throughout
when
held
up
to
the
light
its
a
fairly
murky
beer
the
smell
is
strong
with
some
sweetness
and
ethanol
its
somewhat
reminiscent
of
maple
syrup
with
a
bit
of
fruit
despite
this
sweetness
the
taste
carries
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
as
well
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
balance
out
ultimately
and
the
alcohol
also
shows
up
a
bit
much
its
a
strong
beer
that
drinks
even
less
smoothly
than
its
abv
of
7
5
would
suggest
there
is
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
a
bit
bracing
when
paired
with
the
bitter
notes
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
admittedly
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
good
beer
no
quite
the
standout
one
expects
from
a
vintage
ale
but
it
is
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
expected
as
well
a
bit
disappointing
overall
especially
after
shelling
out
20
can
for
a
6
of
this
it
kind
of
teases
but
doesnt
own
up
the
flavour
is
too
loose
and
disjointed
to
really
leave
a
lasting
impression
the
abv
however
tends
to
kick
like
a
mule
for
7
5
most
likely
the
best
aussie
beer
ive
ever
had
only
been
once
i
wonder
what
flavours
are
around
if
you
cellar
one
for
a
few
years
d
not
very
one
or
two
12oz
bottles
for
the
night
at
most
but
mainly
because
of
the
alcohol
content
as
the
taste
is
good
d
easy
to
drink
too
many
of
these
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavour
and
does
not
detract
from
this
well
balanced
beer
d
one
bottle
is
enough
not
great
just
good
a
nice
strong
ale
but
it
is
so
similar
to
pretty
much
everything
coopers
does
why
bother
making
it
a
vintage
the
alcohol
content
is
high
enough
and
although
i
dont
taste
it
i
certainly
feel
it
that
it
gets
docked
a
point
in
drinkability
elsewise
this
is
an
excellent
brew
that
has
aged
exceptionally
well

this

mmmm
5
more
to
go
overall
a
good

well
balanced

tasty
i
would
love
to
try
this
after
a

years
i
think
i
drank
this
too
young
another
year
might
have
mellowed
it
out
a
bit
still
i
need
to
rate
it
as
i
drank
it
not
as
i
think
it
might
turn
out
someday
d
this
is
something
that
i
would
have
one
or
maybe
two
of

i
would

liked

overall
d
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
it
was
better
with
some
age
on
it
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
either
way
thanks
for
the
trade
paul
d
definitely
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
particularly
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
this
selection
from
coppers
has
an
dark
amber
color
and
an
cream
colored
head
and
a
slightly
spicy
scent
it
starts
out
with
a
malt
sweetness
ballenced
wiht
hop
spice
and
ending
with
a
bitter
finnish
all
mixed
toghter
with
that
funky
coppers
flavor
this
australian
import
is
something
of
an
odd
duck
in
my
view
it
has
a
good
smell
and
appearance
and
an
ok
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
odd
its
almost
like
it
starts
out
with
a
very
flavorful
burst
and
gives
up
i
was
left
wanting
more
in
this
department
i
hope
this
is
somewhat
clear
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
pretty
good
but
far
from
being
transcendental
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
have
ranked
even
higher
had
the
alcohol
not
taken
over
the
flavor

so

nice

and

an
excellent
beer
and
gave
me
a
much
better
impression
of
coopers
beers
than
the
only
other
one
i
have
had
poured
a
cloudy
brown
colour
with
some
chunks
of
yeast
and
a
semi
thick
head
which
dissipated
quite
quickly
it
smelled
very
sweet
and
yeasty
and
had
a
fruity
yeasty
flavour
that
filled
the
mouth
something
that
i
probably
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
but
would
be
good
every
so
often
to
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is

the

the
brew
was
the

took
some
getting

imo
the

had
your

nothing
really
stood
out

i
am
going

have
to
try

i
got

well
some

a
tiny

and
a

theres
also
a

flavor
there
as
well
and
not

it
works
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy

creamy
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
real
ale
style
beer
ill
definitely
be
getting
more
of
this
havent
met
any
coopers
ales
that
i
havent
liked
and
this
is
no
exception
one
of
those
great
finds
while
in
atlanta
ga
a
couple
months
ago
although
the
best
by
date
says
100906
i
beg
to
differ
this
beer
shows
a
lot
of
talent
and
character
a
bottleconditioned
pour
delivers
a
strong
copper
chesnut
hue
with
a
haze
due
to
the
yeast
among
other
particles
within
the
beer
aromas
are
soft
yet
firm
with
serious
notes
of
barley
malt
overrippened
peaches
and
pears
with
a
subtle
english
hop
character
fuggles
all
blends
so
well
the
taste
gives
a
wellmatured
softly
textured
and
seriously
complex
blend
of
marris
ottertasting
malts
that
bring
out
the
soft
fruity
esters
while
contributing
a
spicy
fermented
edgy
yeasty
flavor
again
wellrippened
peaches
and
pears
all
over
the
place
leaving
a
mouth
watering
sensation
after
every
sip
each
drink
follows
with
a
soft
ride
with
aged
hops
and
a
pleasant
albeit
light
hop
flavor
and
mild
sherry
oxidized
notes
that
complemented
the
beer
well
a
mild
metalic
taste
is
the
only
deterant
the
feel
is
a
soft
creamy
malty
fullness
that
never
shows
agression
or
fusal
alcohols
finishes
with
the
same
fruity
flavors
experienced
in
the
taste
with
intermingling
notes
of
hops
and
alcohol
dryness
turned
out
to
hold
a
14
head
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
superior
lacing
this
is
how
i
expect
the
fullers
vintage
ales
to
perform
into
their
prime
this
beer
is
that
good
probably
should
have
waited
to
share
this
beer
with
a
few
local
bas
sorry
guys
but
this
one
is
all
mine
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
describe
as
its
so
simple
yet
so
complex
at
the
same
time
a
perfect
simple
big
malty
vintageold
ale
with
waves
of
big
malt
flavors
just
so
well
done
tasty
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
7
and
a
pretty
good
balance
between
malts
hops
only
missing
ingredient
is
more
flavor
drinkability
great
to
drink
on
a
cold
winters
night
full
flavoured
full
of
life
strong
tastes
with
warming
alcohol
this
is
one
funky
looking
beer
because
of
the
sediment
left
in
this
bottleconditioned
ale
the
beer
pours
a
briney
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
lot
of
sediment
floating
around
that
gives
it
a
very
malty
bready
aroma
also
lots
of
apples
bananas
dates
and
sugar
the
taste
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
traditional
english
pale
ale
but
this
one
is
a
bit
thin
theres
a
nice
bitterness
reminiscent
of
a
barley
wine
but
this
one
is
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
not
a
bad
brew
despite
its
scary
looks
but
ill
try
something
else
for
my
english
ale
fix
drank
alright
alcohol
starts
to
show
up
at
the
end
id
loved
to
found
this
back
when
i
was
in
oz
i
know
all
the
other
coopers
ive
had
were
better
fresh
if
priced
right
id
revisit
no
problem
its
an
interesting
beer
and
fairly
drinkable
for
its
strength
but
it
lacks
the
character
and
depth
of
its
superior
rivals
its
lighter
and
refreshing
and
quite
unique
in
that
way
taken
for
what
it
is
and
simply
enjoyed
hedonistically
without
reference
its
quite
enjoyable
worth
trying
drinkability
just
fine
d
average
the
aging
didnt
do
it
any
favors
one
way
or
another
maybe
i
should
have
had
it
right
away
it
has
a
silky
feel
on
the
palate
after
the
swallow
easily
drinkable
but
almost
scared
by
the
appearance
the
heavy
sediment
almost
looks
like
there
is
something
wrong
with
it
drinkability
ok
this
is
a
new
style
for
me
and
since
this
is
my
first
english
strong
ale
i
have
nothing
to
put
up
as
a
comparison
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
style
with
a
fine
sweetmalty
taste
i
have
several
more
and
will
hold
on
to
them
i
would
rather
drink
other
beers
that
are
tastier
smaller
abv
as
with
most
coopers
beers
this
is
yeastier
than
i
like
but
still
a
nice
drop
reminiscent
of
many
a
strong
yeasty
belgian
ale
good
head
retention
and
lace
quite
sweet
overall
and
not
bitter
as
i
earlier
implied
very
drinkable

i
was
much
more
generous
rating
this
beer
in
the
past
enthusiasm
affects
my
rating
system
but
it
may
have
actually
been
better
six
months
after
purchase
rather
than
two
years
i
might
just
store
a
sixpack
for
next
winter
and
see
if
it
has
changed
from
what
i
think
of
it
now
ill
happily
endorse
this
as
coopers
best
ever
product
and
quite
possibly
australias
best
ever
brew
ill
also
have
to
note
that
batches
and
years
have
varied
greatly
ive
tasted
older
batches
that
are
far
worse
d
great
drinkability
this
ale
is
welcome
in
doses
of
a
pint
or
less
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
with
relatively
low
bitterness
and
mature
maltiness
cheers
cheers
aftertaste
is
comfortable
drying
with
a
hint
of
the
cider
left
on
the
tongue
pours
a
very
murky
light
brown
and
very
little
head
there
is
also
a
lot
of
sediment
and
some
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
not
a
pretty
sight
the
nose
is
substantially
better
a
malty
sweet
smell
combined
with
a
slight
sour
sharpness
that
is
not
unpleasant
maybe
some
apricot
and
spice
as
well
its
a
little
faint
but
fine
the
taste
is
a
little
unusual
with
a
deep
but
light
maltiness
a
little
bit
of
spicy
hops
and
some
orange
peel
flavors
a
touch
of
dried
apricot
makes
another
appearance
a
little
funky
but
somewhat
tasty
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
little
light
a
little
too
off
balance
for
me
to
drink
all
the
time
but
not
bad
to
try
once
what
a
disappointment
dont
know
if
age
will
help
tame
this
beast
not
that
i
need
to
worry
as
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
got
and
dont
plan
on
going
back
for
more
notes

tastes
much
better
after
having
been
stored
at
55
degrees
for
8
months
has
aparently
absorbed
some
the
off
flavors
into
the
yeast
ive
had
this
happen
before
with
minor
heat
damage
but
of
course
there
is
no
substitute
for
proper
cellaring
verdict
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
but
it
seemed
to
lack
a
hook
that
would
make
it
stand
out
good
for
after
dinner
to
be
sipped
slowly
over
conversation
this
is
an
almost
no
flavor
aroma
brew
it
may
be
too
cold
or
old
but
it
is
worth
a
try
for
the
try
bottle
reads
best
after
jun

and
typical
of
coopers
its
a
twist
off

so
as
to
force

toffeeish
and
caramel
like
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
but
some
nice
warmth
is
provided
chewy
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
a
very
good
brew
from
coopers
and
better
than
what
i
remember
of
the
2004
2006
vintage
tasted
careful
not
to
disturb
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
it
pours
a
clear

there
is
little

which
dissipates
quickly
smell
dominated
by
synthetic
fruit
aromas

apple

and
toffee
quite
sweet
to
taste
with
alcohol
coming
through
very
strong
nice
fine
bubbles
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
okay
i
suppose
but
overly
sweet
and
i
was
expecting
more
intensity
with
this
beer
its
vary
drinkable
well
balanced
for
the
style
and
would
compliment
stong
flavored
meats
and
spiced
dishes
the
flavor
profile
was
something
i
didnt
record
in
my
notes
damn
besides
that
it
was
very
tasty
now
thats
descriptive
it
was
a
very
balanced
beer
with
a
moderate
fruit
character
that
made
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
although
if
its
truly
a
strong
ale
it
may
not
really
fit
the
style
too
well
so
what
its
a
good
beer
overall
a
tasty
fruity
beer
high
alcohol
seems
to
be
pretty
well
hidden
i
liked
it
sure
this
beer
is
drinkable
hell
i
even
like
it
i
think
it
tastes
good
but
is
it
special
no
i
just
dont
get
the
needed
complexity
to
keep
my
interest
granted
i
love
englishstyle
old
ales
strong
ales
and
barleywines
so
i
ask
for
more
out
of
them
then
other
beers
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
kansas
city
ks
for
3
i
need
not
buy
this
again
excellent
sippingspecial
beer
d
not
bad
not
good
worth
drinking
mild
malt
overtones
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
character
insipid
mouthfeel
that
is
offputting
most
of
this
went
down
the
drain
medium
mouth
is
right
in
line
with
the
style
it
has
a
little
more
carbonation
than
most
offerings
in
this
style
but
this
is
not
a
problem
at
all
when
paired
with
the
range
of
flavors
one
of
the
more
drinkable
esas

expect

not
prominant
in

somewhere
between

this

is

still
not
a

brew
worth
a
try
over
all
a
good
beer
but
there
seems
to
be
something
missing
maybe
need
an
older
vintage
an
odd
but
not
unpleasant
drinking
experience
nevertheless
i
think
one
would
suffice
for
me
during
a
drinking
session
im
curious
to
try
a
fresher
example
to
see
what
the
difference
would
be
worth
seeking
out
to
try
not
sure
it
could
become
a
favorite
of
mine
body
was
relatively
light
but
the
chunks
were
a
little
harder
to
swallow
this
pours
into
a
pint
glass
the
tan
thick
murky
yeastfilled
liquid
is
nontransparent
the
head
is
big
large
bubbles
that
slowly
dissipate
with
some
time
the
aroma
is
not
overpowering
any
way
it
just
has
some
earthy
hops
and
a
little
stale
bread
the
flavor
is
what
is
also
nice
there
is
a
lot
of
bitterness
in
there
but
the
strong
backbone
of
old
malt
that
kind
of
a
little
on
the
stale
side
also
shows
through
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
drying
bitter
aftertaste
one
is
enough
great
brew
to
switch
it
up
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
buttery
smooth
one
of
the
better
australian
beers
i
have
come
across
thats
not
saying
all
that
much
an
exceptional
brew
from
the
otherwise
barren
land
of
vb
and
fosters
strong
in
the
english
sense
i
dont
imagine
this
keeping
too
much
past
a
couple
years
but
its
one
easy
drinking
strong
ale
so
creamy
and
smooth
i
like
it
a
lot
i
let
this
one
sit
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
because
i
noticed
it
looked
a
little
sedimentymurky
well
that
was
a
bust
cause
it
poured
a
muddy
amber
to
copper
color
with
no
real
head
other
that
some
beigelike
floating
bubbles
lightly
fruity
in
aroma
with
some
dull
honeyed
breadiness
and
some
odd
mineral
notes
tastes
like
the
same
strain
of
yeast
is
utilized
from
the
sparkling
ale
leaving
a
dry
distictive
metallic
twang
lightly
cidery
without
being
appley
almost
seltzery
too
much
play
on
carbonation
and
not
enough
emphasis
on
alelike
qualities
the
only
suggestion
of
its
strength
is
a
slight
lingering
caramel
maltiness
offbalanced
and
strange
but
i
am
intrigued
by
its
dryness
and
accent
on
carbonation
without
making
a
good
pour
twistoff
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
again
coopers
vintage
ale
pours

mixing
in
the

copper

a
thin

aroma

a
bit
vinous
taste
is
slightly
vinous
but
really
more
fruity
i
think
kind
of
a
bit
of
apple
flavor
caramel
also
comes
through
prickly
carbonation
an
interesting
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
dont
tend
to
expect
much
from
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
brown
iced
tea
like
body
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
having
very
active
bubbles
running
through
the
body
the
aroma
of
this
beer
had
a
very
distinctive
lemon
nose
to
it
and
a
bit
malty
the
taste
was
a
pleasing
toasted
malty
presentation
and
some
citrus
in
the
background
with
a
medium
body
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
drinkable
but
not
overwhelming
drinkability
no
showstopper
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
joy
to
drink
the
maltyness
and
yeastyness
play
off
each
other
taste
was
malty
and
fruity
with
just
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
i
could
taste
some
notes
of
caramel
and
a
candyish
taste
in
the
finish
this
beer
seemed
rather
thin
to
me
and
not
very
complex
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
this
was
a
2005
bottle
so
maybe
it
requires
a
few
months
of
aging
the
coopers
vintage
ale
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
color
it
smelled
of
strong
hops
and
spice
the
carbonation
was
high
for
most
beers
but
felt
fairly
moderate
for
coopers
the
body
of
the
beer
was
fairly
heavy
it
is
a
very
strong
ale
the
hops
were
prominent
just
as
in
the
smell
and
it
had
a
strong
finish
with
the
ample
taste
of
spice
this
was
an
interesting
beer
it
was
delicious
while
drinking
it
but
i
really
dont
see
someone
drinking
a
lot
of
it
the
spice
was
really
strong
and
my
girlfriend
said
said
it
tasted
of
soy
sauce
which
i
can
kinda
seeit
was
not
a
bad
thing
just
a
really
spicy
finish
d
quite
easy
to
drink
and
id
definitely
buy
more
not
quite
a
session
star
the
high
abv
makes
this
a
oneortwo
only
affair
i
dont
recommend
this
one
too
much
not
bad
but
just
not
really
doing
it
for
me
i
drank
this
alongside
a
few
really
really
awesome
barleywines
so
ill
review
again
when
i
am
tasting
it
on
its
own
coopers
extra
strong
vintage
ale
reminds
me
of
a
higher
alcohol
english
pale
it
could
use
a
tad
more
depth
and
assertiveness
but
its
still
a
worthwhile
beer
that
i
found
appealing
this
is
my
favorite
coopers
brewery
offering
to
date
and
has
to
be
included
in
my
top
handful
of
aussie
beers
as
well
mouthfeel
is
spiced
dry
and
lingering
highly
reccomended
feel
is
soft
carbonation
nothing
spectacular
but
that
would
be
good
if
it
strikes
the
mood
like
a
marzen
poured
a
cloudy
coopper
copper
coler
with
only
modest
slightly
offwhite
head
quickly
fell
to
only
thing
ring
has
a
nice
fruity
smell
with
the
promise
of
great
things
to
follow
the
taste
is
truly
extraordinary
nice
maltiness
with
a
very
strong
fruitn
character
dates
plums
finish
is
very
smooth
and
although
there
is
a
distinct
lack
of
carbonation
it
ends
nice
and
creamy
for
a
7
5
beer
this
is
a
suprisingly
easy
drinker
d
im
at
a
bit
of
a
loss
with
this
one
as
i
havent
really
encountered
anything
quite
like
it
before
much
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
that
it
initially
appears
this
ale
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
its
complexity
and
elusiveness
in
being
easily
identifyable
is
a
virtue
in
this
case
i
believe
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
with
the
heavy
sediment
removed
altogether
i
suspect
this
is
a
good
part
of
its
appeal
however
a
worthy
although
odd
ale
i
can
honestly
say
i
like
it
and
would
drink
it
again
and
since
i
have
2
more
bottles
i
intend
to
do
just
that
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
very
good
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
just
dont
get
much
pleasure
drinking
it
overall
i
think
this
one
is
certainly
one
to
try
but
one
i
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
to
have
again
especially
the
price
where
i
got
it
it
was
20
a
six
pack
although
that
place
is
always
expensive
luckily
they
sold
it
singly
or
i
wouldnt
have
tried
it
drinkability
just
a
few
too
many
flaws
here
and
there
to
be
very
good
im
disappointed
as
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
aussie
is
this
supposed
to
be
a
malt
liquor
this
is
a
complete
messup
i
cant
think
of
anything
positive
about
this
brew
riddled
with
offflavors
looks
horrible
acrid
mouthfeel
bad
drinkability
its
all
there
definitely
pass
on
this
one
it
totally
sucks
drinkability
im
more
than
impressed
by
this
brew
especially
for
the
seemingly
lower
end
reviews
meaning
many
significantly
lower
than
a
total
of
4
but
i
think
this
is
complex
satisfying
original
tasty
and
altogether
a
great
drinking
experience
make
sure
you
decant
properly
if
youre
not
a
big
sediment
fan
though
because
like
smuttynose
ipa
theres
tons
and
itll
make
its
way
into
the
glass
if
youre
not
careful
then
i
ask
what
did
the
four
years
do
i
guess
it
has
to
be
good
things
either
way
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
and
even
if
youre
a
bit
wary
you
should
try
it
for
sure
drinkability
damn
good
i
will
have
to
get
another
one
and
cellar
it
until
the
date
on
the
bottle
easydrinking
and
utterly
undistinguished
is
it
a
good
beer
i
dont
think
it
is
coopers
extra
strong
vintage
ale
comes
in
a
vintage
looking
bottle
and
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
yet
cloudy
colour
with
a
humongous
head
that
crowns
up
over
the
glass
without
spilling
over
the
label
indicates
7
5
alcohol
and
that
they
achieve
it
from
choice
malts
and
an
extended
top
fermentation

the
smell
is
a
combination
of
aged
toasted
malt
and
the
sharpness
of
alcohol
the
first
taste
to
greet
you
is
the
sharpness
of
the
high
alcohol
content
its
not
particularly
well
hidden
especially
for
only
being
7
5percent
the
second
taste
is
a
toasted
malty
pseudosweetness
followed
again
by
the
alcohol
dryness
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
bodywise
and
carbonationwise
but
postswallow
the
alcohol
can
get
to
you
its
not
as
easydrinking
beer
as
you
would
hope
and
the
dryness
becomes
a
bitterness
to
sum
up
i
wont
buy
this
beer
again
although
it
looks
pretty
nice
and
smells
pretty
good
coopers
makes
their
extra
strong
vintage
ale
seem
like
the
12
belgian
that
doesnt
balance
out
the
high
alcohol
content
the
only
problem
is
that
coopers
extra
strong
is
7
5
alcohol
and
does
a
poor
job
of
balancing
it
out
all
the
more
disappointing
i
adore
their
sparkling
ale
and
stout
but
this
beer
is
not
one
of
their
best
but
this
is
not
a
bad
sipper
especially
if
you
want
something
a
bit
different
d
a
quite
strong
beer
it
somehow
is
quite
restrained
and
simplistic
in
terms
of
overall
flavour
still
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
savour
once
in
a
while
cheers
beertracker
nice
drinkable
beer
here
but
i
think
i
can
find
better
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
loads
of
floaties
and
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
traditional
english
ale
scent
which
is
sweet
but
with
a
bisquity
aroma
its
bitter
with
a
slight
warmth
and
some
burnt
toffee
character
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
toffee
flavor
with
a
slight
warmth
and
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
havent
had
any
exceptional
beers
from
these
guys
but
they
all
drink
pretty
well
swirlling
up
the
yeast
and
other
sediments
in
the
last

at

in

va
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
away
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
some
distant
malt
character
the
flavor
has
a
nice
malt
base
slightly
raisiny
and
it
also
has
a
warming
alcohol
sinsation
not
really
my
favorite
style
the
mouthfeel
was
moderate
and
the
drinkability
was
just
ok
because
of
the
apparent
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
with
a
nice
punch
of
carbonation
for
a
strong
ale
this
is
a
good
drinking
brew
i
could
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
after
a
hard
days
work
recommended
a
standup
brew
would
go
great
with
a
heaping
serving
of
heavily
spiced
apple
cobbler
and
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
i
first
had
this
beer
at
a
bar
in
north
adelaide
australia
was
a
very
special
brew
as
it
was
expensive
and
therfore
really
good
back
then
ive
seen
it
around
and
have
been
looking
for
a
single
which
i
finally
found
it
pours
an
oranged
light
brown
color
with
a
small
coat
of
head
over
top
the
nose
is
slightly
raisiney
almost
woodyoaky
with
a
tealike
tanniny
quality
to
it
the
flavor
is
slightly
spicey
very
slightly
raisiney
with
hints
of
tanniney
wood
i
like
it
i
was
right
to
enjoy
it
back
in
the
birthplace
of
this
brew
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
moderate
carbonation
i
really
dont
get
any
of
the
7
5
alcohol
this
is
a
mighty
fine
beer
really
brings
back
some
memories
to
this
young
beer
drinker
drinkability
this
one
was
very
tasty
and
went
down
super
easy
at
2
79
per
this
one
was
worth
it
for
sure
drinkability
notes
wow
very
tasty

nice
bite
from
the
hops
with
the
lingering
spicy
alcohol
to
complement
went
great
with
a
plate
of
lamb

over
fusilli
treat
with
care
and
youll
enjoy
pours
a
hazy
amber
orange
color
that
is
topped
by
a
thin
tan
colored
head
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
malty
with
some
weird
almost
vegetal
notes
as
well
as
notes
of
alcohol
cleaning
solution
caramel
the
beer
is
sweet
quite
well
carbonated
and
has
subtle
oxidation
notes
of
sherry
in
some
ways
it
is
quite
light
on
the
palate
the
taste
is
much
more
agreeable
than
the
aroma
hinted
at
this
is
definitely
slanted
on
toward
the
malty
side
of
the
spectrum
in
some
ways
it
even
reminds
me
of
diluted
malt
extract
certainly
interesting
and
i
am
glad
that
i
picked
this
up
but
i
think
that
it
might
be
a
bit
more
malty
and
fresh
tasting
if
it
was
a
bit
younger
poured
out

cloudy

peat
hops
and
alcohol
late
to
the
party
and
not
a
bloom
so
much
as
just
a
presence
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
smooth
full
bodied
with
an
effervescence
all
over
the
mouth
and
tongue
but
biased
to
the
tip
warms
the
throat
nicely
drinkability
is
very
high
the
flavor
is
very
complex
and
well
balanced
both
to
the
nose
and
the
tongue
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
sadly
the
nasty
looking
crap
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
makes
you
not
want
to
finish
it
which
really
affects
drinkability
flavor
is
sweet
ripe
fruit
and
brown
sugar
with
some
toffee
too
no
real
alcohol
presence
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
smooth
but
the
finish
is
a
little
empty
not
the
best
brew
for
aging
i
think
even
with

this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
transluscent
ambergold
the
head
was
small

ephemeral
and
there
was
no

the
subdued
aroma
contained

a

of

other
than
a

there
was
little
to
the
taste
except
some

and
a

the
finish
was
plain
just
a

i
guess
i
was

so
i
was

smooth
drinking
very
complex
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
this
is
a
pretty
strong
beer
very
nicely
done
and
im
glad
i
had
it
yum
very
drinkable
and
quietly
complex
in
its
own
way
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
vintage
ale
one
that
was
advertised
as
able
to
age
well
the
label
recommended
this
beer
be
consumed
within
18
months
so
i
was
catching
it
right
near
the
end
of
that
time
limit
still
it
appeared
to
not
have
held
up
all
that
well
word
of
advice
if
you
dont
want
a
mass
of
sediment
in
your
beer
pour
this
one
very
carefully
2000

it
is
a

with
a
thin
wisp

the
aroma
was
weak
with
some

notes
i
have
not
tasted
this
beer
when
it
was
fresh
so
i
have
no
frame
of
reference
to
compare
it
it
is
malty
and
creamy
but
it
seems
that
any
hop
character
has
all
but
disappeared
it
is
a
mellow
beer
that
goes
smooth
and
easy
but
is
just
average
in
taste
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
unless
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
i
got
a
bunk

they
move

also

sight
i
should
of
been
more
careful
pouring
this
because
expeariance
should
have
warned
me
my
very
first
coopers
was
a
stout
many
years
ago
and
it
had
about
3
tablespoons
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
that
bottle
always
good
when
coopers
put
this
out
its
a
very
nice
strong
ale
and
while
the
2002
isnt
necessarily
the
best
it
definately
improves
with
age
overall
this
one
has
clearly
aged
well
and
according
to
those
in
the
now
is
ideally
at
its
best
after
18
months
judging
by
how
good
this
was
i
cannot
disagree
with
them
quite
simply
the
best

i

and
really
enjoyed
this
beer

theres
a
yeasty
background
to
the
nose
less
so
at
the
taste
with
some

just
for

fairly

enduring

felt

i
really
liked
a

a
twist
off

an
intersting

not
captivating
beer
it
became
much
less
enjoyable
as
the
alcohol
smell

taste
took
over
i
have
one
of
these
set
aside
for
aging
that
i
will
try
in
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
it
has
changed
however
i
dont
think
that
this
brew
is
big
enough
to
age
well
for
very
long
if
this
is
coopers
top
of
the
line
including
large

it
doesnt
seem
to
play

bourbon

better
but
this
was
a

change
the
taste
seems
to
bring
out
a
little
more
wooden
musky
cellar
characters
with
those
malts
but
nothing
is
really
in
my
face
mild
finish
maybe
it
is
supposed
to
be
mellow
if
so
they
succeeded
i
think
i
wanted
more
punch
it
pours

are

a

malt

taste

smokey

with
a

definitely
unique
it

pretty

actually
not
very

not
very
bitter
either
i
let
a
few
people
who
dont
like
craft
beer
sample
it
and
they
actually
enjoyed
it
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
regularly
solid
and
definitely
worth
a
try
to
experience
something
a
little
different
cheers
nice
amber
color
with
a
very
good
aroma
its
smooth
with
a
subtle
taste
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
few
of
excelent
beer
with
oak
and
single
malt
very
nice
enjoyable
and
smooth
could
have
a
couple
more
cheers
obvious
bourbon
especially
in
tasting
but
not
so
much
as
to
completely
overpower
the
nice
malt
base
some
good
woodybarrel
flavor
too
along
with
vanilla
and
toffee
in
the
finish
o
this
is
pretty
straightforward
uncomplicated
ale
designed
to
feature
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
characteristics
the
sugars
are
forward
but
not
so
much
thats
its
overly
sweet
like
kentucky
bourbon
ale
its
quite
drinkable
without
being
distinctive
and
pairs
well
with
something
like
a
fullbodied
somewhat
spicy
cigar
which
i
enjoyed
immensely
with
this
growler
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
nose
its
to
be
savored
before
drinking
recommended
as
a
nitecap
more
fruity
and
toasty
than
i
recall
the
nuttiness
dominates
its
a
bit
hot
but
will
likely
benefit
from
some
aging
a
tad
cloying
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
session
the
feel
is
a
little
fizzy
but
it
begins
to
iron
out
near
the
end
if
your
a
real
fan
of
this
type
of
ale
than
this
is
a
must
have
overall
pretty
well
done
and
probably
worth
trying
if
you
are
into
barrel
aged
beers

the

legs

its

88
5
but
whos
to
say
do
very
different
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
here
i
struggle
to
call
this
complex
though
i
wonder
if
this
is
what
schlafly
was
shoot
for
by
mixing
their
barleywine
with
their
bourbon
barrel
aged
pale
ale
because
that
sounds
delicious
i
just
didnt
care
for
this
one
much
overall
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
drink
a
strong
ale
not
sure
what
schlafly
was
going
for
in
this
beer
are
there
infection
issues
with
this
beer
i
ask
that
because
i
have
drank
2
other
schlafly
beers
that
have
been
infected
this
brewery
does
not
have
a
great
track
record
with
me
schlafly
special
reserve
bourbon
barrel
ale
is
a
strong
inyourface
dark
ale
that
will
immediately
trick
your
nose
into
thinking
youve
poured
yourself
a
pint
of
kentucky
bourbon
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
strangely
it
is
exactly
those
bourbon
tones
that
make
this
beer
so
drinkable
when
it
hits
the
palate
the
boozey
taste
smell
from
the
high
alcohol
content
that
can
sometimes
impinge
flavor
is
masked
beautifully
behind
that
bourbon
barrel
smoke
screen
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
those
special
occasions
when
only
something
stronger
will
do
d
surprising
beer
very
drinkable
if
only
a
little
sweet
this
effort
to
put
something
other
than
stouts
into
bourbon
barrels
still
needs
some
work
but
shows
promise
as
the
vanilla
and
wood
characteristics
come
through
far
stronger
than
usual
o
glad
i
picked
this
up
on
my
most
recent
kentucky
venture
at
10
99
a
sixer
i
cant
think
of
many
better
values
a
nice
complex
bourbon
aged
ale
that
probably
wouldnt
satisfy
youre
bourbon
lovers
but
would
be
a
nice
intro
into
bba
beers
overall
a
nice
smooth
a
mellow
bourbon
aged
ale
with
no
heavy
alcohol
taste
at
all
followup
i
tried
this
again
about
7
months
later
at
a
beer
tasting
and
liked
it
much
much
better
its
possible
that
i
had
a
bad
bottle
before
or
that
this
beer
is
just
much
better
when
fresh
this
is
a
good
beer
but
still
doesnt
stand
up
to
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
if
the
sweetness
was
just
toned
down
a
bit
and
the
bourbon
a
little
more
pronounced
this
beer
would
be
amazing
o
a
good
beer
and
a
great
bargain
for
only
11
per
sixer
ive
had
worse
bbal
beers
that
cost
much
more
for
a
single
bottle
i
would
like
a
bit
more
depth
beyond
the
bourbon
characteristics
and
a
creamier
body
but
its
still
very
tasty
and
smells
great
rich
looking
copper
color
with
a
light
cloudiness
to
it
i
was
impressed
by
the
thick
look
to
it
rich
head
of
white
across
the
top
faded
quickly
leaving
behind
only
token
lace
in
its
wake
the
aroma
was
sweet
lots
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
piney
hops
make
it
just
bitter
enough
to
get
by
really
nice
profile
here
as
i
take
the
first
sips
rich
malts
smooth
easy
caramel
flavor
with
a
light
and
subtle
bitterness
that
reminded
me
of
a
nice
barleywine
medium
feel
here
as
the
syrup
like
nature
of
it
lended
itself
to
a
bit
thicker
of
a
profile
thought
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
indeed
interesting
nose
buttery
cinnamon
toast
and
canned
pumpkin
lead
the
way
at
first
with
bourbon
and
toffee
becoming
increasingly
assertive
as
it
warms
the
bourbon
aromas
stay
under
control
and
the
bourbon
flavor
does
as
well
i
think
this
might
improvesmooth
out
with
age
and
am
inclined
to
perhaps
go
find
a
couple
more
bottles
at
this
stage
its
fairly
tasty
if
slightly
disjointed
tangy
fruit
and
oak
plus
abundant
carbonation
dont
quite
let
the
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
do
their
thing
tart
and
abundant
fruitiness
almost
like
jolly
rancers
at
times
the
bourbon
is
pretty
subtle
not
quite
an
afterthought
but
close
buttered
toast
again
comes
to
mind
nuts
and
cocoa
too
leafy
and
earthy
hops
arent
shy
this
could
perhaps
turn
into
a
nice
english
barleywinetype
ale
with
a
little
time
in
ye
olde
cellar
i
wish
i
knew
the
abv
on
this
one
overall
an
excellent
beer
the
second
excellent
offering
from
schlafly
in
a
row
for
me
the
beer
is
an
awesome
value
and
this
all
culminates
in
the
sentiment
that
i
am
deeply
saddened
schlafly
doesnt
distribute
in
ohio
o
i
want
to
like
this
more
than
i
do
but
i
just
dont
find
this
overly
remarkable
not
bad
just
nothing
special
after
having
had
kentucky
ales
bourbon
barrel
ale
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
one
just
pales
in
comparison
and
whats
the
abv
even
the
web
site
dont
tell
ya
overall
well
worth
it
find
it
buy
it
pours
a
murky
dark
copper
orange
with
a
2
inch
whiteorange
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
cap
broken
rings
of
lace
form
randomly
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
coconut
vanilla
light
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
coconut
vanilla
and
cake
there
is
a
slight
hop
presence
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
as
well
this
beer
has
a
lower
carbonation
level
with
a
slightly
thick
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
nice
barleywine
characteristics
and
very
nice
coconut
and
vanilla
smells
and
tastes
my
first
beer
from
schlafly
bottle
to
snifter
looks
good
definitely
colored
at
least
in
part
by
bourbon
barreling
smells
excellent
hops
are
laced
in
nicely
with
the
bourbon
scent
tastes
good
the
ale
is
alright
but
the
bourbon
barreling
is
what
this
beer
is
all
about
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
its
definitely
a
sipper
overall
a
good
beer
especially
for
its
price
considering
its
bourbon
barreled
that
ill
be
having
again
overall
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
great
taste
that
is
a
great
fusion
of
bourbon
and
beer
the
best
parts
bourbon
vanilla
creamy
chocolate
are
fused
with
nice
sweet
malts
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
d
overall
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
taste
seemed
slightly
watered
down
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
good
i
would
certainly
have
this
one
again
d
theres
nothing
too
fantastic
about
this
beer
theres
also
nothing
i
can
fault
it
on
regardless
its
moderately
tasty
and
worth
drinking
glad
i
tried
it
lemon
zest
hops
that
i
presume
come
from
the
pale
ale
part
of
the
blend
up
front
moves
into
melted
caramel
and
vanilla
apple
juice
creeps
in
here
as
well
not
sure
if
the
meeting
of
these
two
beers
just
imparts
an
odd
slightly
off
flavor
but
it
just
doesnt
come
fully
together
what
it
is
however
is
a
good
beer
that
is
unique
and
just
misses
of
the
mark
of
being
very
good
d
as
mentioned
this
is
like
their
barleywine
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
awesome
beer
for
bourbon
barrel
lovers
i
have
been
really
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
i
wish
they
sold
this
in
st
louis
considering
thats
where
its
brewed
because
i
would
buy
this
everytime
i
went
to
the
store
solid
stuff
very
hazy
medium
brownish
orange
color
no
head
very
thin
ring
around
edge
very
oaked
aroma
with
nice
toastedness
from
barrel
highly
carbonated
very
toasty
oak
flavor
sweet
oaky
finish
some
sweet
from
the
bourbon
on
the
finish
some
smokiness
picked
up
in
the
middle
of
drink
not
much
else
in
flavor
to
pick
out
pretty
oaky
all
the
way
through
a
little
dryness
on
end
but
pretty
smooth
hides
alcohol
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
good
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
but
that
is
kind
of
nice
as
it
makes
it
more
drinkable
overall
a
well
blended
barrel
aged
brew
everything
works
well
and
achieves
a
good
balance
tasty
stuff
im
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
one
all
in
all
an
interesting
and
creative
take
on
the
barrel
d
ok
but
after
a
few
sips
i
can
tell
i
wont
want
another
after
this
one
1
bottle
is
great
but
2
bottle
is
too
much
d
a
beer
that
is
hard
to
characterize
the
label
says
a
blend
of
their
pale
ale
and
barleywine
not
sure
what
i
would
call
it
but
i
like
it
dont
love
it
a
nice
change
of
pace
if
you
want
something
with
bourbon
characteristics
but
not
a
ris
not
exactly
a
summer
beer
i
could
easily
see
reaching
for
a
2nd
if
it
was
fall
and
i
was
in
front
of
a
campfire
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
left
at
the
same
time
i
am
not
sure
i
would
buy
again
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
the
only
knock
i
have
on
this
beer
is
that
it
is
thin
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
still
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
love
the
blended
idea
curious
on
how
this
will
age
well
done
this
was
much
better
than
my
first
taste
of
the
beer
and
i
would
say
that
it
is
aging
well
i
will
check
in
on
it
in
another
6
months
pick
some
up
if
you
can
find
it
it
has
a
pretty
thin
mouth
feel
but
it
really
is
a
drinkable
beer
especially
for
a
bourbon
barrel
ale
thanks
to
gemutlichkeit
for
this
awesome
extra
for
the
style
this
beer
is
actually
immensely
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
very
high
almost
too
high
so
that
the
beer
is
incredibly
light
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
slightly
sticky
and
holds
the
flavors
well
drinkability
i
wanted
to
save
a
couple
for
aging
that
didnt
go
too
well
mouthfeel
is
as
expected
very
decent
though
nothing
particularly
outstanding
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
i
dont
think
ill
be
breaking
into
my
other
bottle
of
this
tonight
because
it
is
much
to
sweet
to
stomach
more
than
12
ounces
but
im
definitely
glad
that
i
get
to
experience
it
again
a
solid
b
and
one
the
more
interesting
beers
youll
ever
try
this
was
blind
tested
with
the
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
in
cincy
the
kbba
came
out
the
winner
but
it
was
close
nice
effort
from
schlafly
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
im
wondering
why
they
blended
their
barley
wine
with
the
pale
ale
the
pale
doesnt
seem
to
add
much
besides
that
watery
mouthfeel
towards
the
end
the
hops
dont
come
out
much
either
overall
not
mind
blowing
but
very
balanced
personally
id
like
the
bourbon
to
pop
a
bit
more
than
it
does
it
seems
to
fall
a
little
short
of
the
stronger
bourbon
flavor
id
like
good
beer
though
poured
from
the
12
oz
bottle
into
my
snifter
this
beer
is
a
dark
copper
color
with
good
clarity
but
with
a
head
that
doesnt
last
long
at
first
the
smell
is
mostly
of
the
english
hops
but
reveals
more
bourbon
scent
as
it
warms
the
smell
is
a
bit
disappointing
i
expected
more
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
lackluster
i
dont
get
much
bourbon
mostly
just
some
malty
sweetness
im
mostly
comparing
this
to
lexington
brewerys
bourbon
barrel
ale
which
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
flavors
with
this
one
just
seem
to
be
muted
even
after
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
sticky
and
i
dont
know
what
the
abv
is
but
the
alcohol
is
not
very
noticeable
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
theres
other
bourbon
barrel
ales
id
rather
be
drinking
drinkability
very
nice
flavors
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
taste
that
isnt
burning
my
throat
out
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
sadly
the
abv
is
apparently
unknown
but
im
definitely
feeling
it
so
i
dont
think
i
could
sit
through
too
many
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
decent
lacing
is
good
it
smells
like
caramel
malt
vanilla
oak
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
bourbon
aroma
isnt
as
strong
as
i
thought
it
would
be
luckily
the
bourbon
comes
out
more
in
the
flavor
i
can
taste
oak
vanilla
caramel
malt
toffee
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
theres
also
a
lingering
bittersweet
fruity
and
bourbony
aftertaste
even
though
the
label
says
the
beer
is
a
blend
of
barleywine
and
pale
ale
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
i
didnt
pick
up
a
lot
of
hops
in
the
aroma
or
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
this
was
fun
and
i
am
excited
to
see
schlafly
try
something
new
i
was
not
expecting
the
bourbon
to
be
as
strong
as
it
was
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
d
one
i
would
get
again
any
day
very
good
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
producted
by
alltechs
lexington
brewing
company
schlafly
takes
a
better
balance
between
the
strong
malt
character
and
the
bourbon
aging
and
is
a
stronger
beer
throughout
but
the
hops
struggle
to
blend
with
the
delicate
bourbon
character
causing
too
much
conflict
rather
than
balance
ocooperstown
most
flavorful
brew
but
the
balance
and
all
of
the
other
factors
do
not
make
this
the
best
clear
looking
mahogany
brown
with
a
loose
thin
tan
head
this
beer
doesnt
have
great
lacing
and
looses
its
head
relatively
quickly
the
beer
smells
like
a
strong
ale
with
a
sweet
malt
base
and
some
biting
alcohol
there
is
a
touch
of
fruitiness
in
the
nose
but
its
not
delicate
and
refined
like
a
belgian
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
toastychocolatiness
with
some
biting
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
all
wrong
and
completely
off
balance
overall
i
would
suggest
that
you
do
not
seek
out
this
beer
because
clearly
its
not
made
for
the
general
beer
drinker
its
made
for
someone
interested
in
sucking
down
an
unrefined
mess
of
beerrelated
flavors
overall
with
better
examples
of
the
style
i
am
torn
to
hate
this
but
it
did
drink
very
well
for
a
strong
ale
o
to
me
this
style
always
tastes
like
the
wort
from
a
belgian
ale
without
the
adjunct
spices
and
thats
what
im
getting
from
this
beer
its
like
a
halfbaked
belgian
ale
its
o
k
just
not
something
im
gushing
about
taste
is
quite
good
i
am
surprised
by
this
one
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
go
together
nicely
brown
aleesque
maltiness
throws
down
a
nice
base
layer
for
a
pretty
hefty
mineral
aspect
looking
at
the
label
and
brewery
i
was
thinking
this
one
would
be
a
little
on
the
gimmicky
side
ok
alot
on
the
gimmicky
side
but
this
is
quite
a
nice
little
treat
that
shows
some
nice
depth
and
some
solid
uk
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
lowly
carbonated
chad
obviously
knows
what
hes
doing
sending
this
one
around
o
overall
very
nice
tasty
and
certainly
interesting
medium
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
highly
drinkable
maybe
thats
why
i
got
a
case
of
it
recommended
o
very
enjoyable
ale
another
good
beer
from
a
regional
brewer
o
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
too
bad
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
o
it
actually
started
off
nicely
but
by
the
time
i
finished
it
was
not
as
good
the
buttery
flavor
was
a
bit
overpowering
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
overall
it
really
wasnt
special
it
certainly
does
not
stand
out
for
a
strong
ale
unfortunately
disappointing
the
best
beer
from
cooperstown
brewing
imo
wellbalanced
flavorful
all
over
a
very
good
brew
pours
slightly
reddishbrown
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
that
mostly
dissipates
rich
malty
nose
with
some
fruity
sweetness
taste
of
malts
and
implications
of
dark
dried
fruits
medium
mouthfeel
and
nicely
drinkable
light
overall
but
with
lots
of
character
had
no
problem
taking
a
few
home
with
me
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
o
meh
beer
probably
wouldnt
bother
getting
again
its
cheap
though
its
sweet
but
not
like
the
smell
also
theres
a
good
dollop
of
bittering
hop
that
gives
this
some
balance
very
rich
body
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
the
malt
has
a
good
biscuit
and
white
bread
lightly
toasted
this
is
one
of
the
better
strong
ales
ive
ever
had
i
live
just
an
hour
and
a
half
from
cooperstown
so
i
see
their
beer
on
the
shelves
all
the
time
but
have
never
before
today
committed
to
buying
any
of
their
products
next
time
i
go
on
a
beer
run
ill
for
sure
be
seeking
more
of
this
out
notes
this
beer
is
well
made
and
dangerously
drinkable
d
a
pretty
good
brew
it
warms
the
tongue
a
little
and
the
flavor
lasts
a
decent
time
the
only
negative
is
that
it
is
a
little
sweet
for
me
pours
an
effervescent
copper
color
with
a
huge
towering
head
that
dies
away
relatively
quickly
the
aroma
is
mostly
bready
maltiness
which
is
sweet
and
nutty
around
the
edges
the
flavor
is
also
very
breadynutty
a
bit
of
that
7
7
abv
shows
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
lower
than
the
pour
had
me
anticipating
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
brown
ale
that
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
notes
a
great
beer
from
an
upstate
new
york
brewery
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
cooperstown
brings
to
the
table
thanks
to
doug
and
eric
who
threw
this
in
on
a
beer
trade
clear
copper
pour
with
decent
head
and
lacing
nice
malty
nose
with
lots
of
toffee
brown
sugar
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
evolves
as
this
beer
warms
lots
of
nice
toasty
caramel
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
to
it
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
to
balance
it
out
the
slightly
higher
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
which
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
reminded
me
of
sitting
in
a
pub
in
london
really
a
well
done
beer
and
unexpected
surprise
from
a
great
beer
trade
single
pickup
from
westmere
albany
d
fairly
drinkable
strong
taste
holds
me
back
especially
since
the
flavor
sticks
around
for
so
long
d
a
decent
beer
from
a
rather
unknown
brewery
at
least
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
id
check
this
one
out
again
if
i
get
the
chance
having
six
different
beers
in
their
mixed
12
pack
makes
picking
it
up
easy
for
an
out
of
towner
like
myself
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
tap
room
colgate
inn
in
hamilton
ny
this
one
shows
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
cover
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
brings
honey
banana
toffee
pleasant
but
not
very
strong
the
flavor
matched
the
aroma
with
much
more
force
theres
cider
mash
and
maple
sugar
with
an
herbal
hop
touch
its
medium
bodied
and
medium
drinkable
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
interesting
a
worthy
entry
somewhat
of
a
cough
medicine
taste
or
maybe
bourbon
inflected
i
would
like
to
try
again
not
a
barn
burner
but
different
and
enjoyable
enough
something
dirty
about
it
and
it
has
a
perfumy
presence
on
the
weak
side
of
things
its
not
bad
an
extremely
tasty
english
strong
ale
i
see
a
collection
of
pinhead
sized
pellets
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottles
i
wonder
if
these
pellets
are
infectious
colonies
of
bacteriayeast
but
i
see
these
in
each
bottle
that
i
had
dmangtrnov
25
its
a
fairly
tasty
brew
and
it
smells
great
i
did
find
it
a
bit
boozy
as
it
went
however
the
taste
and
the
carbonation
is
not
very
aggressive
which
makes
it
smooth
and
soft
on
the
palate
im
not
sure
id
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
avoid
this
beer

is
more

and
the
flavors
and

were
much
better
when
warmer
about

vs
45
or
so
for
the

gozoct
26
top
is
medium
in
its
feel
and
the
finish
spicy
in
the
hop
category
although
not
a
bad
thing
hints
of
plum
and
a
larger
aray
of
malt
complexity
nothing
special
but
a
good
ale
poured
from
gearys
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
amber
with
a
slight
redness
it
seems
up
to
the
light
half
finger
of
white
head
and
more
than
average
lacing
long
after
the
nose
is
of
heavy
malt
bread
syrup
and
strawberry
or
raspberry
i
cant
quite
tell
the
taste
is
nothing
of
memorable
quality
strong
alcohol
taste
almost
rubbing
alcohol
malt
and
burnt
syrup
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
definitely
minimal
carbonation
overall
nothing
great
and
nothing
i
would
get
again
decent
beer
though
i
had
hoped
for
more
o
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
cheers
this
is
a
great
session
beer
but
at
7
abv
it
needs
to
be
respected
this
has
been
my
go
to
for
15
years
very
well
balanced
special
indeed
overall
rich
and
very
enjoyable
beer
honestly
im
not
huge
on
the
english
strongs
but
this
one
just
seemed
way
too
sweet
to
me
overall
this
seems
to
me
a
well
executed
beer
but
its
a
little
harsh
in
a
way
that
isnt
as
appealing
as
truly
great
big
beers
are
harsh
it
might
just
not
be
my
kind
of
style
i
lean
towards
imperial
stouts
and
ipas
when
i
want
to
go
big
fans
of
esas
might
dig
this
an
enjoyable
beer
that
seems
to
add
the
right
amount
of
american
hops
to
what
i
would
assume
would
be
a
solid
esb
or
englishstyle
ipa
styles
that
i
can
appreciate
but
rarely
wow
me
pours
a
rich
amber
with
no
head
at
all
aroma
is
of
bread
and
caramel
with
a
light
hint
of
fruit
medium
bodied
on
the
tongue
its
very
upfront
with
the
caramel
sweetness
of
the
malt
but
finished
with
a
nice
hop
bite
the
alcohol
dies
linger
for
a
while
but
is
very
satisfying
o
very
english
and
very
portland
no
matter
how
many
newer
more
inventive
breweries
pop
up
in
this
state
the
old
school
open
fermented
yorkshire
inspired
ales
with
ringwood
yeast
in
my
opinion
are
sort
of
the
foundation
of
maine
brewing
and
gears
hsa
to
me
is
some
sort
of
the
pièce
de
résistance
a
decadent
deluge
of
english
inspired
flavor
done
in
the
old
world
style
crisp
with
a
surprising
heft
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
this
beer
is
nevertheless
barely
mediumbodied
but
well
within
range
and
with
a
nice
smoothness
along
with
the
good
clean
crisp
bite
o
normally
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
these
guys
damn
near
nailed
this
its
super
clean
drinkable
yet
nicely
complex
and
savorable
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
this
is
one
of
those
hidden
gems
that
few
people
know
about
but
is
actually
really
damn
good
the
taste
has
an
upfront
roasted
malt
and
caramel
sweetness
and
a
wonderfully
lingering
dry
finish
only
7
yeah
but
some
strong
ales
still
have
a
boozy
feel
but
not
this
one
gearys
has
hit
the
mark
on
the
style
it
really
feels
like
im
drinking
it
at
a
british
pub
rather
than
at
m
y
computer
in
new
hampshire
usa
drinkability
easy
light
and
mind
blowing
complex
id
be
surprised
to
see
how
many
of
these
i
could
have
in
an
evening
before
the
weight
flavorwise
not
abvwise
got
to
me
i
guess
i
could
have
2
or
3
but
damn
try
it
for
yourself
its
something
which
hasnt
ever
not
been
not
nothing
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
get
from
time
to
time
wellbalanced
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
rubyhighlighted
caramel
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
white
head
nose
of
apricot
and
mango
fruit
sweetness
and
a
caramel
backbone
tangy
aromas
overall
flavors
of
roast
initially
with
a
biscuit
backbone
honey
and
fruit
sweetness
and
a
spicy
blend
overlay
light
bodied
with
a
roasty
and
tangy
sweet
aftertaste
clean
slightly
sharp
finish
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
despite
a
slightly
elevated
abv
and
heavy
flavor
profile
pours
a
relatively
dark
amber
with
a
light
beige
head
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
medium
length
of
time
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
rich
with
deep
caramel
malt
flavor
its
doughy
and
sweet
toffee
shortbread
raisins
prunes
dates
syrup
its
a
rich
muddling
of
toasted
malt
sugar
theres
some
booze
in
the
aroma
and
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
but
once
the
beer
hits
the
proper
temperature
it
contributes
more
warmth
than
harshness
the
taste
is
otherwise
quite
sweet
but
the
hops
are
more
apparent
than
in
the
aroma
and
besides
providing
some
respite
from
the
caramel
adds
in
a
mineralgrassy
note
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
for
a
7
abv
beer
this
is
an
interesting
beer
before
it
had
a
chance
to
warm
up
the
booze
seemed
to
come
out
in
excess
at
cellar
to
room
temp
the
sweetness
shined
and
the
booze
blended
into
the
beer
good
stuff
o
a
mega
drinkable
beer
that
could
possibly
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
to
pitch
the
strength
but
has
all
the
balls
of
a
strong
ale
with
the
balance
of
a
female
mental
structure
but
if
that
doesnt
make
total
sense
then
lets
just
say
it
goes
off
with
a
bang
but
cuddles
your
taste
buds
into
a
sweet
finish
overall
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
quite
oldschool
and
not
something
i
drink
on
a
normal
basis
but
i
dig
it
popped
one
of
these
open
tonight
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
beautiful
reddishbrown
hue
with
a
light
fizzy
head
that
disappeared
almost
immediately
wonderful
malty
aroma
and
plenty
of
malt
taste
but
with
a
decisive
bitter
finish
good
solid
beer
but
a
little
flat
gearys
beer
always
reminds
me
of
when
beer
was
beer
if
you
know
what
i
mean
a
strong
old
school
foundation
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
really
my
style
kind
of
a
malt
bomb
but
the
bitter
finish
helps
to
balance
enjoyed
it
more
the
second
time
o
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
for
the
style
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
were
it
available
in
my
area
d
actually
not
bad
i
didnt
expect
much
after
finding
this
one
in
a
local
bottle
shop
that
i
rarely
visit
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
example
of
the
style
the
malt
character
is
quite
nice
and
if
finishes
with
balanced
bitterness
that
makes
it
quite
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
hides
its
alcohol
well
although
its
complex
enough
to
enjoy
sipped
slowly
o
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
the
esters
were
nicely
balanced
with
the
grain
flavors
the
bitterness
in
the
middle
is
a
bit
acrid
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
tasty
esa
o
a
solid
beer
and
seems
to
fit
the
style
well
very
drinkable
too
its
no
fullers
but
id
buy
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
for
lack
of
other
options
in
the
particular
environment
i
drank
quite
a
few
of
these
and
they
grew
on
me
probably
not
a
trade
bait
type
beer
but
certainly
a
moderately
complex
and
very
well
balanced
one
despite
being
decent
sized
at
7
it
drinks
whacked
easy
i
like
that
there
is
some
significant
malt
quality
to
it
and
more
hops
than
a
lot
of
ipas
ill
have
it
again
i
have
a
lot
of
english
strong
ales
in
my
fridge
right
now
especially
compared
to
the
styles
availability
in
the
us
lets
start
with
the
one
american
version
i
have
pours
an
attractive
redamber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
rather
sweet
with
caramel
and
butterscotch
malts
along
with
some
floral
hops
the
taste
has
that
sweet
toffee
malt
kinda
thing
going
along
with
a
substantial
floral
english
hop
presence
aftertaste
is
fairly
nonexistant
which
is
the
biggest
knock
i
have
against
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
bodied
for
an
english
ale
and
is
very
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
nice
strong
ale
bring
the
rest
of
them
on
o
pretty
solid
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
religiously
but
would
buy
it
if
i
found
it
wouldnt
drink
too
many
at
once
either
this
heavyweight
packs
a
punch
m
buttery
smooth
light
carbonation
very
drinkable
d
solid
was
expecting
it
to
taste
a
little
bigger
and
complex
but
not
disappointed
overall
this
brew
lived
up
to
its
high
rating
in
the
esa
category
and
will
be
climbing
after
my
review
loved
this
brew
and
it
is
right
up
there
on
my
favortites
in
the
style
list
w
thomas
jeffersons
tavern
ale
from
yards
what
more
can
you
ask
for
an
esa
produced
in
maine
that
can
compete
w
if
not
edge
the
legendary
fullers
1845
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
decent
nothing
too
exciting
though
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
malts
and
grain
flavors
with
a
dry
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
i
expected
the
carbonation
wasnt
bad
either
overall
this
was
an
average
beer
in
my
opinion
d
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
stock
ale
strong
ale
whatever
gearys
has
uk
style
brews
down
solid
abundant
use
of
goldings
and
lots
of
malt
work
well
but
the
flavor
can
get
intense
o
always
love
this
one
by
gearys
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
o
another
solid
brew
from
gearys
the
style
is
done
very
nicely
and
is
definitely
a
pure
example
of
an
english
strong
ale
the
gearys
hsa
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
stickyicky
up
the
sides
and
a
beautiful
14
inch
head
it
smells
good
but
would
probably
smell
better
if
my
dishwasher
didnt
do
such
a
shitty
job
sorry
gearys
the
beer
still
tastes
great
it
almost
tastes
like
an
esb
despite
its
strong
ale
label
i
know
the
salesman
told
me
id
say
that
and
my
heart
wants
to
be
contrarian
but
it
does
taste
like
an
esb
feels
great
going
down
excellent
beer
d
this
is
an
exceptionally
well
crafted
english
strong
ale
strong
in
all
facets
if
this
were
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
it
would
no
doubt
be
in
my
go
to
rotation
i
will
gladly
invest
in
a
sixer
of
this
anytime
im
passing
through
dl
geary
territory
and
stronglys
suggest
that
you
do
the
same
definitely
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
kind
of
musty
and
old
feeling
a
little
like
i
pulled
an
old
bottle
out
of
someones
basement
ok
beer
drinkability
a
great
fusion
of
american
and
english
ales
i
sometimes
wonder
how
james
joyce
got
away
with
this
crap
for
so
long
o
didnt
even
bother
to
finish
too
flat
temperature
was
fairly
cold
that
felt
right
flavor
and
carbonation
did
not
cut
it
for
me
odmost
of
my
reviews
depict
the
battle
between
expectation
and
actuality
this
one
beats
expectations
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
cool
beer
hey
maybe
my
evading
geary
brewing
company
was
a
bad
idea
gearys
summer
pale
ale
are
you
next
o
expected
more
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
believe
i
may
have
waited
too
long
to
try
this
as
after
reading
some
reviews
my
aromas
and
flavors
seem
lacking
nice
beer
though
and
will
try
it
again
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
i
will
certainly
try
to
get
more
of
this
i
think
its
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
just
watch
your
quantity
with
that
7
abv
itll
catch
you
though
not
bad
this
certainly
isnt
a
beer
to
get
excited
about
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
even
and
goes
down
with
a
smooth
feel
some
nice
aftertaste
that
does
linger
a
little
too
long
man
i
love
this
thats
not
a
very
objective
statement
to
put
into
a
review
but
i
think
its
because
this
is
a
taste
for
yourself
kind
of
beer
it
is
unbelievably
agreeable
and
sensational
but
the
reasons
why
are
sort
of
vague
there
arent
huge
hoppy
notes
or
big
malty
sweets
there
is
just
a
balance
of
all
things
which
create
a
wonderfully
intune
song
i
guess
you
just
have
to
try
it
and
i
am
going
to
try
it
again
and
again
d
it
depends
for
me
i
love
this
beer
but
there
are
times
when
one
is
surely
enough
and
other
times
where
i
can
drink
4
of
them
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
me
but
the
buttery
taste
from
the
ringwood
yeast
can
make
this
a
sipper
spot
on
for
the
style
this
beverage
emmits
a
rich
though
pale
malting
medium
golden
coloured
body
with
a
generous
intially
enormous
foamy
white
head
above
average
mouthfeel
themalting
is
complex
and
tasty
with
a
dryish
and
slightly
bitter
finish
d
nice
malty
sipping
beer
if
not
served
too
cold
the
rich
fruity
malt
is
masterfully
balanced
by
the
grassy
hops
a
very
complex
brew
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
why
did
it
take
me
so
long
to
discover
this
beer
gearys
really
hit
it
hard
with
this
beer
right
up
there
with
yorkshire
stingo
a
recent
botmc
arrival
looks
like
a
buttkicker
at
7
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
hints
of
licorice
brown
sugar
and
molasses
pours
to
a
deep
bronze
with
a
microbubble
foamy
head
the
taste
is
a
kicked
up
brown
ale
flavor
with
a
nice
noble
hop
bite
the
ac
is
slightly
evident
in
the
lingering
but
smooth
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
sparky
carbonation
to
augment
the
hop
bite
this
is
a
very
high
ibu
special
ale
and
is
indeed
quite
tasty
a
great
drinker
but
the
7
probably
sneaks
up
fast
i
think
ill
cellar
the
other
two
bottles
i
have
and
see
how
it
tastes
a
year
from
now
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
for
sure
i
really
think
it
could
be
marketed
as
an
imperial
amber
as
i
find
the
hops
dont
seem
to
be
totally
true
english
hops
as
the
ba
classification
might
imply
nonetheless
i
like
and
think
its
really
well
done
d
could
definitely
throw
back
plenty
of
these
without
a
second
thought
very
drinkable
imo
had
on
cask
at
cambridge
common
deep
mahogany
color
that
blended
perfectly
with
the
table
topped
by
the
loosest
head
ive
ever
seen
i
could
have
dropped
a
golf
ball
between
the
bubbles
at
first
this
had
an
odd
flemishsour
bend
to
it
but
that
disappeared
after
it
warmed
up
a
bit
relative
to
its
initial
temperature
plenty
of
hops
in
the
nose
along
with
vanilla
cherries
and
a
burlappy
smell
that
reminded
me
of
a
warm
barn
hops
were
mild
in
the
taste
malt
was
dominant
with
fruit
and
figs
and
the
whole
thing
was
very
very
dry
tasty
indeed
but
i
have
a
suspicion
that
this
might
be
better
a
bit
colder
from
a
bottle
now
this
does
look
like
an
intriguing
beer
doesnt
it
it
pours
a
clear
russetruby
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
light
ecru
foam
which
doesnt
hang
around
to
chat
very
long
the
nose
comprises
vodkasoaked
buttery
biscuits
light
rye
bread
and
a
smidgen
of
orange
rind
interesting
turn
lets
see
where
it
leads
the
taste
strips
away
some
of
the
booze
which
is
replaced
by
a
stronger
version
of
the
orange
peel
everything
else
remains
fairly
static
from
nose
to
tongue
now
thats
an
image
am
i
right
the
body
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
overall
an
interesting
brew
indeed
but
not
something
i
can
see
drinking
very
much
of
in
the
future
db
i
like
the
malt
and
yeast
flavors
but
the
bitter
alcohol
finish
throws
the
balance
off
for
me
interesting
but
wears
me
down
with
a
beastly
finish
certainly
a
stronger
7
beer
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
and
it
makes
a
small
head
when
poured
i
liked
the
finish
of
the
beer
but
its
tanginess
reminded
me
of
many
german
beers
rather
than
british
ales
as
advertised
drinkabilitythis
beer
is
very
one
dimensional
all
carmel
and
malt
if
you
like
these
flavors
you
will
like
this
beer
the
carmel
is
not
overwhelming
however
so
it
does
go
down
easy
im
originally
from
new
england
and
was
never
a
huge
fan
of
gearys
pale
ale
but
this
stuff
is
incredibally
good
what
a
beautiful
pour
with
the
yellow
label
i
was
not
expecting
the
dark
amber
pour
head
was
creamy
eggshell
34
inch
dissipated
quickly
but
not
quickly
enough
to
keep
me
from
getting
that
great
creamy
first
sip
through
it
soft
grass
and
citrus
in
the
nose
with
definite
caramel
maltiness
velvety
mouth
feel
and
orange
peel
flavor
fade
into
a
delicious
fresh
grass
and
faint
alcohol
on
the
exhale
my
favorite
gearys
for
sure
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
i
am
not
very
experienced
but
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
d
average
drinkability
is
affected
by
the
evident
alcohol
and
astringency
overall
impression
not
bad
at
all
but
probably
not
something
id
revisit
a
solid
well
balanced
beer
im
a
definite
sucker
for
banana
bread
so
this
beer
had
me
from
the
start
really
while
technically
this
beer
suffers
from
the
flaw
of
smells
better
than
it
tastes
it
tastes
good
enough
pahnmay

but
there
add
some
balance
to
this
beer
how
ever
small
a
hop
presence
it
might
be
without
it
i
would
easily
confuse
this
beer
with
a
wee
heavy
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
well
done
brew
it
is
well
balanced
and
flavorful
it
has
some
strength
so
it
is
hard
to
drink
it
too
fast
so
drink
slowly

make
this

a

offering
its
a

beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
in
conclusion
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
rises
above
average
in
every
aspect
however
doesnt
quite
rise
to
the
occasion
of
being
excellent
in
any
category
except
luckily
the
taste
id
highly
recommend
this
one
i
was
quite
suprised
a
very
good
all
around
beer
drinkable
for
the
abv
to
be
sure
not
harsh
or
strong
enough
in
any
category
to
make
it
a
nono
for
any
type
off
food
from
sushi
to
pizza
this
one
does
fine
i
have
to
be
honest
theres
not
a
lot
to
say
its
a
reasonably
strong
sweetish
ale
this
is
a
pretty
onedimensional
but
extremely
well
executed
beer
a
great
pizza
football
or
chillinbyyourself
beer
12
ouncer
with
a
new
label
motif
twist
off
cap
no
freshness
dating
pours
a
nice
honeygolden
tone
of
amber
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
and
leaving
moderate
lacing
clear
with
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
for
a
good
long
while
nose
is
malty
with
some
vanilla
and
confectionary
sugar
this
is
a
sweet
flavorful
brew
goes
down
very
easy
notes
of
vanilla
mild
rum
straw
and
lightly
spicy
finish
a
bit
warming
feels
and
tastes
slightly
thin
for
the
style
understated
and
very
british
ie
subtle
and
balanced
two
fine
qualities
in
a
brew
pleasant
wintertime
sipper
notes
the
head
and
lacing
were
both
something
to
admire
the
thing
that
made
me
really
enjoy
this
beer
was
its
structure
it
is
very
balanced
not
boring
balanced
clear
orange
little
to
no
head
surprisingly
intense
aroma
extremely
sweet
fruity
apricot
pears
and
orange
hoppiness
this
is
another
fruit
blend
had
with
wachusett
winter
ale
that
seems
to
work
pretty
well
though
this
one
is
a
lot
hoppier
wet
juicy
mango
flavor
with
malt
closing
to
earthy
generous
hoppiness
is
rather
complex
something
of
a
cascade
hop
but
with
more
depth
perhaps
a
bit
cloying
at
the
end
but
still
pretty
enjoyable
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
but
the
hop
presence
balances
this
well
the
flavor
is
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
malts
but
as
in
the
aroma
it
is
well
balanced
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
it
to
be
this
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
is
slightly
thin
id
prefer
it
to
have
a
thicker
body
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
good
beer
from
the
deep
amber
color
to
the
inviting
deep
toasty
and
mildly
fruity
aroma
and
the
complex
flavor
profile
that
includes
banana
hazelnut
toasted
coconut
mocha
and
dark
chocolate
this
is
a
great
cold
weather
beverage
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
winter
session
beer
as
im
ready
for
another
and
am
feeling
nice
and
toasty
nice
coppery
colorhead
last
the
whole
way
down
decent
carbonation
level
ok
aromavery
malty
theres
almost
a
metallic
odorbordering
on
a
high
alcohol
level
but
i
wouldnt
think
thats
it
at
only
7
very
malty
flavor
caramel
like
very
slight
earthiness
to
the
finish
decent
body
an
enjoyable
beer
i
havnt
had
this
in
years
seemed
to
improve
as
it
warms
a
little
i
dont
know
how
much
id
look
to
have
this
again
as
it
has
never
been
a
personal
favorite
worth
a
try
though
in
all
honesty
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
wonderful
hop
aroma
and
warm
finish
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
warm
malty
flavor
that
is
a
bit
dry
and
hoppy
on
the
finish
it
has
a
bit
of
yeast
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
winter
seasonal
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
an
awesome
drinker
drinkability
easy
light
and
mind
blowing
complex
id
be
surprised
to
see
how
many
of
these
i
could
have
in
an
evening
before
the
weight
flavorwise
not
abvwise
got
to
me
i
guess
i
could
have
2
or
3
but
damn
try
it
for
yourself
its
something
which
hasnt
ever
not
been
not
nothing
simply
put
an
amazing
beer
i
really
think
this
can
give
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
a
run
for
its
money
a
bit
darker
and
richer
but
not
as
hoppy
even
at
7
alcohol
this
is
a
great
session
beer
ill
have
another
deep
copper
slightly
reddish
hues
with
a
small
but
persistant
light
tan
head
nice
malty
tones
dominate
the
nose
slighty
grainy
with
mild
hops
detected
good
malty
sweetness
with
a
dry
grainy
finish
reminds
me
of
a
red
ale
flavorful
and
dry
mouthfeel
not
too
heavy
quite
nice
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
make
this
a
regular
brew
for
me
but
alas
i
have
only
been
able
to
get
2
bottles
definately
recommended
thanks
to
sheepnutz
for
providing
me
this
beer
in
a
trade
it
pours
a
deep
amber
to
slightly
deep
red
in
color
the
head
starts
about
a
finger
high
but
falls
to
just
ring
the
top
with
sparse
cover
what
a
nose
i
love
malt
and
i
love
hops
this
give
me
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
malt
is
giving
me
caramel
with
a
rich
toffee
almost
buttery
tone
as
well
the
hops
blend
really
well
into
the
malt
but
i
get
some
citrusy
notes
from
those
very
rich
flavor
like
a
super
rich
caramel
floods
my
taste
buds
there
is
a
fantastic
hop
bitterness
dncing
on
my
tongue
after
swallowing
the
beer
good
good
and
good
the
beer
is
thick
but
not
as
thick
as
i
would
have
expected
this
is
a
tradeoff
in
my
book
as
it
increases
the
drinkability
for
the
full
flavor
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
just
a
good
beer
a
hearty
strong
ale
drinkable
for
the
style
at
7
abv
this
is
not
a
boring
beer
given
the
spectrum
of
flavors
very
enjoyable
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
after
my
first
couple
of
bottles
but
it
does
seem
to
grow
on
you
an
acquired
taste
in
my
opinion
the
earthy
woodiness
takes
some
getting
used
to
overall
there
still
seems
to
be
something
that
is
slightly
unbalanced
with
this
ale
a
welldone
ale
very
english
in
spirit
not
bottleconditioned
but
a
very
nice
strong
ale
i
recommend
this
one
drinkability
is
very
good
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
thanks
to
mikeys01
for
the
offerring
my
thanks
to
kfoss99
for
this
contribution
now
i
know
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
gearys
the
recycling
bin
near
the
cabin
is
full
of
your
bottles
hampshire
special
ale
from
a
stubby
brown
bottle
pours
a
reddish
brown
perfectly
clear
nice
head
off
white
that
leaves
a
little
covering
but
not
much
lace
the
aroma
is
malty
but
with
an
unmistakable
whiff
of
alcohol
as
well
the
taste
is
very
nice
malty
and
with
definite
tastes
of
dried
fruits
including
raisins
prunes
sweet
long
lasting
aftertaste
with
cidery
flavors
fairly
highly
carbonated
interesting
brew
but
the
alcohol
taste
is
notable
and
would
have
earned
this
beer
another
half
star
without
it
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
and
would
warm
me
up
just
nice
in
the
winter
can
a
beer
be
too
balanced
i
love
balance
but
the
flavors
seem
to
mix
here
and
almost
void
each
other
out
i
can
hardly
get
anything
from
the
smell
of
this
beer
maybe
an
alcohol
spicyness
i
cant
really
distinct
the
sweet
from
the
bitter
the
malt
from
the
hop
here
theres
a
fruity
flavor
that
is
both
tart
and
sweet
bittersweet
caramel
and
earthy
aspects
the
finish
is
very
strong
in
alcohol
esp
as
i
let
it
warm
but
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
atleast
for
a
couple
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
it
didnt
blow
my
socks
off
overall
a
solid
beer
thanks
to
oldfrothingslosh
for
the
bottle
poured
a
golden
orange
color
and
topped
off
with
a
thin
film
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
interesting
with
fermented
apple
wine
notes
fresh
bread
and
even
cherry
cider
the
taste
is
rich
and
complex
with
bitter
musty
fruits
in
the
forefront
and
a
semisweet
dry
alcohol
finish
medium
and
herbal
malt
body
that
leaves
a
candy
like
spiciness
on
the
tongue
creamy
and
pleasantly
bitter
with
a
nice
tang
to
boot
a
very
nice
ale
this
has
a
lot
to
offer
i
took
a
gamble
on
a
case
of
this
hsa
as
a
20022003
the
store
had
it
in
the
discounted
outofdate
section
it
poured
a
clear
dark
orangy
gold
with
a
minimal
head
the
initial
aroma
was
of
sharp
spices
and
maple
malts
theres
also
a
touch
bitter
of
hops
back
there
somewhere
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
lusciousa
medium
thickness
offset
by
modest
carbonation
the
taste
is
reasonably
well
balanced
there
a
syrupy
cherry
and
pear
sweetness
at
the
start
but
it
fades
quickly
as
the
hops
kick
in
and
the
finish
is
rather
tart
the
alcohol
is
more
evident
in
the
taste
than
i
expected
for
a
7
brew
i
think
its
more
potent
than
reported
thanks
to
doctorwu100
for
the
fresh
bottles
im
not
a
big
fan
of
strong
ales
but
this
one
is
actually
drinkable
and
enjoyable
many
of
them
are
too
solventlike
for
my
tastes
hsa
is
complex
and
tasty
too
bad
it
doesnt
have
a
wider
distribution
id
love
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
ontap
some
day
copper
colored
with
a
beige
head
of
bubbles
of
assorted
sizes
that
settle
quickly
but
leave
a
fine
layer
of
foam
across
the
top
of
the
liquid
complex
aroma
of
malt
and
spice
and
apple
and
pear
and
cinnamon
and
butterscotch
and
cotton
candy
the
more
i
sniff
the
more
i
notice
in
it
flavor
seems
to
be
made
up
of
small
parts
of
malt
hops
banana
and
spice
with
a
definite
alcohol
finish
and
lingering
bitter
this
is
a
very
warming
beer
with
a
rich
and
satisfying
flavor
i
for
one
dont
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
here
to
preface
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
far
from
it
in
fact
but
what
is
also
is
not
is
the
beer
to
end
all
beers
like
ive
heard
described
it
pours
a
sloid
dark
amber
colour
with
a
moderate
head
that
just
doesnt
last
for
very
long
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
butter
toffee
malt
and
along
with
in
the
taste
but
maybe
moreso
here
in
the
smell
is
a
weird
rubber
tire
type
presence
its
just
a
bit
off
to
me
and
that
alone
knocks
this
one
out
of
the
4
catergory
for
smell
and
taste
other
than
that
it
is
quite
nice
with
malt
and
alcohol
dominating
the
flavour
with
that
nagging
rubber
taste
in
the
back
this
is
a
moderately
bold
brew
that
id
revisit
again
for
sure
but
would
have
trouble
having
more
than
2
maybe
3
in
a
sitting
overall
id
recommend
trying
this
one
at
least
once
but
ill
stick
to
my
favourite
gearys
brew
and
one
of
if
not
my
overall
favourite
of
the
new
england
brews
their
standard
pale
ale
any
day
over
this
one
medium
body
seems
much
higher
in
abv
than
it
really
is
this
just
didnt
appeal
to
me
at
all
this
is
a
good
strong
beer
but
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
it
all
night
edit
revisiting
this
one
after
being
away
for
3
years
7
doesnt
knock
me
quite
on
my
arse
anymore
its
an
interesting
beer
theres
some
of
that
belgian
astringency
in
there
whod
a
thunk
it
its
just
beautiful
stunning
bumped
drinkability
up
a
lot
appearance
wow
what
a
beer
way
up
knocked
the
flavor
down
a
little
for
the
astringency
still
thrilled
to
have
scored
a
half
rack
its
been
three
long
years
man
this
is
a
good
beer
clear
ambercopper
hue
with
bronzybrown
influences
the
color
is
fabulous
the
head
was
very
small
at
its
apex
it
might
have
reached
a
14th
of
a
finger
in
height
it
faded
quickly
to
a
thin
soapy
collar
the
lacing
was
absent
the
nose
had
some
lovely
depth
there
was
a
mix
of
light
citrus
juiciness
sweet
maltiness
a
hint
of
biscuit
butterytoffee
a
faint
note
of
woodyalcohol
the
potency
is
modest
but
the
bouquet
is
inviting
nevertheless
the
palate
is
down
right
tasty
the
toasty
caramel
malt
really
stands
out
in
this
offering
it
is
rich
and
deep
with
just
enough
of
a
hint
of
biscuit
when
the
butterytoffee
notes
mixed
in
all
i
can
say
is
wow
the
fruitiness
was
mild
and
interwoven
perfect
citrus
and
honey
soaked
berries
the
bite
of
hops
is
surprisingly
burly
no
im
not
talking
west
coast
hoppy
but
it
is
nicely
aggressive
the
persuasion
of
alcohol
is
very
faint
the
palate
is
wellrounded
and
tremendously
gratifying
to
quaff
medium
in
body
the
carbonation
is
low
and
natural
mouthfeel
is
a
tickle
thin
maybe
i
am
knit
picking
hsa
is
a
relaxing
beer
it
fits
comfortably
like
an
old
pair
of
slippers
i
see
why
this
beer
is
so
respected
it
is
very
agreeable
if
i
had
this
beer
available
locally
i
would
treasure
it
like
gold
a
thank
you
goes
out
to
bierman9
for
the
sample
recommended
12
ounce
bottle
a
very
nice
drinkable
and
hoppy
brew
a
little
taste
of
maine
right
here
in
the
midwest
a
big
thanks
to
johnnyp
for
the
2
bottles
served
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
hsa
pours
into
my
glass
crystal
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
swirling
white
head
of
nice
tight
bubbles
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
and
also
quite
fruity
reminiscent
of
apples
and
pears
fallen
from
the
tree
in
autumn
very
little
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
initially
sweet
and
carmely
with
the
fruit
coming
in
towards
the
middle
finish
is
surprisingly
hoppy
and
bitter
amazing
how
well
the
hops
were
hidden
at
first
tast
this
is
a
different
beer
fairly
well
balanced
but
just
tipping
to
the
malty
side
of
the
scale
body
is
on
the
high
side
of
medium
to
almost
full
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
night
but
not
quite
as
bold
as
i
expected
pours
a
clear
deep
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
seems
centered
around
alcohol
with
caramel
and
malt
dry
bread
crust
and
nutswalnut
and
almond
a
little
floral
hop
character
as
well
first
taste
is
malty
and
but
quickly
turns
to
a
sharp
hopiness
and
astringency
finish
is
smooth
and
soft
very
nice
balance
as
you
drink
it
youd
swear
that
it
has
more
than
its
stated
7
abv
however
although
its
solidly
good
nothing
about
the
beer
particularly
stands
out
this
12oz
bottle
of
ale
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
an
inch
of
head
that
fizzled
out
in
a
couple
minutes
has
a
very
nice
hop
aroma
that
is
slightly
floral
and
grassy
chocolate
malt
coming
through
in
nose
also
with
notes
of
nice
fresh
grains
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
sharp
carbonation
at
the
back
of
the
throat
flavor
is
balanced
between
malt
blends
and
hops
with
a
nice
english
like
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
also
detect
some
sweetness
in
the
malts
overall
a
fine
example
of
an
english
style
one
that
could
be
a
very
nice
session
brew
thanks
david
bierman9
for
the
sample
very
nice
winter
brew
yum
city
12
oz
into
a
nonick
pint
the
aroma
is
slightly
citrusy
almost
like
pines
the
taste
slightly
caramel
reminiscent
of
better
imperial
stouts
but
with
a
lighter
body
and
a
slightly
sour
mouthfeel
that
is
almost
heavenly
the
carbonation
is
almost
ideal
i
think
im
going
out
and
getting
a
sixer
of
this
tomorrow
the
beer
restocker
guy
at
whole
foods
recommended
this
and
i
later
heard
about
the
johnnyp
fan
club
still
i
highly
recommend
this
one
good
session
beer
great
sour
hoppy

bready

slight

medium

the

strikes
me
as
extremely
nutty
almost
brazils
and
filberts
with
the
skins
on
working
with
an
odd
dryish
hop
flavor
slightly
buttery
but
ive
had
worse
finishes
full
somewhat
papery
with
a
light
molasses
tone
id
drink
it
again
especially
if
they
fiddled
with
the
hop
bill
a
little
thanks
to
who
else
johnnyp
for
the
beer
its
got
character
alright
hmmm
think
ill
go
have
another
when
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
slight
head
forms
which
quickly
dissipates
the
color
is
a
dark
and
malty
with
a
slight
tinge
of
red
to
my
untrained
eye
a
nice
aroma
with
an
obvious
alcohol
odor
in
the

taste
is
nice
with
a
slight
warming
present
an
indication
of
the
7
abv
a
benefit
of
the
brew
a
nice
unexpected
bite
of
bitterness
can
also
be
its
downfall
knocking
its
sessionability
down
a
bit
however
on

it
was
incredible

enjoy
it
while
the
weather
sucks
with
the
whole
johnnyp
hsa
thing
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
overrated
but
i
was
wrong
this
is
fantastic
thank
you
to
mydeadguy
for
shipping
this
beer
if
i
can
find
it
this
would
be
a
beer
id
have
again
a
wellpolished
topaz
color
that
lightens
on
the
edge
this
beer
pours
out
a
heaven
of
clouds
for
a
head
soft
puffy
stain
often
sticks
out
smells
sweet
abundantly
fruity
and
slightly
yeasty
taste
is
tart
with
flavors
of
big
malts
turned
funky
sweet
but
thin
tasting
of
lemony
licorice
it
has
an
atringent
dry
tart
finish
with
a
roasty
burnish
i
often
feel
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
and
it
doesnt
blend
in
well
also
the
thin
mouthfeel
is
often
bubbly
and
often
oily
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
good
for
the
style
notes
not
my
favorite
seasonal
but
easily
drinkable
pours
a
pretty
clear
amber
copper
color
it
is
topped
by
a
light
tan
head
there
is
a
nice
dry
hoppy
aroma
evocative
of
english
hops
a
bit
lemony
slightly
grassy
wow
i
was
not
expecting
so
much
hop
flavor
to
be
packed
into
this
beer
it
has
a
balancing
malt
sweetness
a
bit
of
caramel
quite
good
i
am
duly
impressed
the
hop
flavor
is
citrusy
and
floral
in
character
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
which
is
perfect
for
this
beer
this
is
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
has
enough
body
to
balance
the
stellar
hop
flavor
i
certainly
wish
that
i
had
access
to
more
of
this
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
beer
this
is
a
dark
tawny
amber
brew
with
hints
of
red
the
aromas
are
of
sweet
malts
and
spicy
hops
in
the
background
do
they
use
saaz
in
this
stuff
this
is
not
overly
hopped
nor
overly
spiced
so
that
makes
this
stuff
a
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
winter
seasonal
that
still
packs
a
bit
of
a
warming
wallop
with
its
7abv
like
i
said
the
drinkability
is
very
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
without
being
too
thick
or
cloying
i
raise
my
glass
to
johnnyp
this
hsa
is
for
you
i
guess
it
is
nice
to
have
this
available
year
round
and
cheap
up
in
maine
over
here
these
bottles
are
rarely
seen
i
had
to
beer
trade
for
this
one
this
stuff
tastes
lovely
and
is
incredibly
drinkable
the
combination
of
spiciness
and
hops
is
to
my
palate
just
challenging
enough
its
not
as
grandmotherly
as
harpoon
winter
warmer
which
showers
you
with
wonderful
pumpkin
pie
spices
neither
is
it
a
harsh
taskmaster
such
as
sierra
nevada
celebration
which
flogs
you
in
a
loving
way
mind
you
with
bitter
hops
this
stuff
walks
right
down
the
middle
its
obviously
a
fantastic
session
beer
nice
color
and
a
nice
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
toasted
grain
has
a
nice
firm
carbonation
upon
first
sip
great
flavors
that
are
dominated
on
the
sweet
side
of
butterscotch
toffe
spicy
malt
and
dried
fruits
has
a
nice
alchohol
punch
to
it
but
by
no
means
is
is
overpowering
very
rich
full
texture
and
a
nice
hoppy
finish
that
tries
to
keep
up
with
the
malt
like
this
one
another
impressive
brew
from
gearys
crystal
clear
copper
colored
with
very
minimal
head
aroma
is
bready
malt
and
fruity
hops
apples
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
butterscotch
very
smooth
with
a
buttery
buiscity
taste
toffee
and
fruit
make
an
appearance
as
before
being
rounded
out
by
big
oily
hops
mouthfeel
may
be
a
bit
thinner
than
i
prefer
but
i
sure
didnt
want
to
stop
at
one
so
i
didnt
i
like
strong
beers
so
this
is
almost
like
a
session
beer
for
me
good
stuff
backwash
the
one
word
other
than
delicious
that
really
fits
this
beer
is
balance
i
realized
after
working
my
way
through
a
few
of
these
that
it
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
fullers
1845
ba
calls
both
strongold
ales
and
i
cant
disagree
few
beers
live
up
to
their
hype
especially
from
homestate
chauvinists
but
i
was
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
lean
more
toward
malty
beers
this
hits
my
sweet
spot
goes
very
well
with
hearty
cheeses

the
12
inch
head
lasted
till
the
end
of
the
pint
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
of
husky
grain
the
taste
was
wellrounded
and
the
alcohol
was
easily
detected
in
this
one
very
smooth
and
balanced
not
a
hop
monster
i
also
noted
a
slightly
nutty
aftertaste
very
good
but
could
get

in

you
decided

johnnyp
was
right
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
holidays
let
it
snow
i
have
some
set
aside
to
age
and
cant
wait
to
see
what
happens
to
this
beer
over
time
it
appears
some
maine
beers
are
making
there
way
to
michigan
and
that
is
fine
by
me
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
will
grab
again
throughout
the
winter
pours
out
clear
deep
gold
with
little
head
to
speak
of
aroma
has
some
bready
burnt
malts
and
a
decent
citousy
hop
scent
this
is
one
of
those
scents
that
singes
the
nosehairs
with
some
spices
in
there
to
boot
taste
is
very
unique
starts
off
with
some
sweet
maltiness
and
some
spice
then
a
wallop
of
floral
hops
hits
you
yet
finishing
off
creamy
good
dry
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
wants
to
breakdance
in
your
mouth
alot
going
on
here
heavy
carbonation
makes
for
a
good
strong
mouthfeel
and
dry
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
in
part
due
to
the
creaminess
of
this
brew
this
is
a
very
sweet
full
rich
and
ungodly
drinkable
beer
i
put
away
four
of
these
on
a
sunday
afternoon
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
a
special
ale
certainly
and
a
new
favorite
for
me
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
a
bigger
advocate
of
one
beer
than
johnnyp
and
this
one
i
thank
my
lucky
stars
and
johnnyp
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
and
cellar
one
if
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
i
better
buy
up
all
i
can
this
is
one
fine
beer
huge
thanks
to
marc77
and
bierman9
who
both
submitted
samples

hands
down
for
me
while
in

a

color
with
a
slight
red
tintnot
much
head
to
it
but
what
there
was
left
some
real
nice
lace
rich
is
the
word
i
use
to
describe
this
beer
in
coloraromaand
mostly
flavor
very
malty
and
whiskyish
and
of
dried
fruit
for
a
malt
maven
or
whatever
u
wanna
call
it
this
to
me
is
a
perfect
or
near
perfect
beerrich
and
warming
a
great
winter
beer
very
tasty
and
complex
definitely
a
beer
marching
to
the
beat
of
its
own
drum
a
bit
rough
edged
with
some
strange
flavors
that
dont
entirely
go
well
together
but
as
a
whole
its
an
enjoyable
pint
i
can
certainly
notice
the
alcohol
after
a
couple
of
these
and
its
a
bit
palate
fatiguing
so
i
didnt
think
the
drinkability
was
all
that
high
20012002
edition
given
to
me
by
a
beer
store
owner
who
said
that
3
6packs
of
this
has
been
sitting
on
the
floor
of
his
store
for
2
years
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddishcopper
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
almost
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
slight
alcohol
and
sweet
caramel
and
malt
a
fairly
full
nose
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
at
first
with
little
bits
of
toffee
and
dates
then
finishes
with
a
little
hops
bitterness
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
for
a
7
brew
i
definately
need
to
go
back
and
pick
up
the
rest
of
those
lonely
6packs
from
the
beer
store
floor
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
slighlty
thin
head
the
head
slowly
receded
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
along
with
some
spotty
bubbles
on
the
surface
the
aroma
was
sweet
but
the
alcohol
was
definitely
noticable
the
flavor
was
a
great
balance
of
sweetness
spiciness
and
bitterness
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
there
is
a
slight
malt
and
alcohol
aftertaste
definitely
a
tasty
ale

nice

slight

with

coming
through

was
fairly
high
but
fit
well
with
the

of
the
beer
after
a
while
aroma
and
flavor
started
to
remind
me
of
artificial
strawberries
think
lollipops
had
this
for
the
first
time
last
night
took
a
sixpack
down
to
youngs
lobster
pound
and
drank
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
lobster
dinner
damn
good
out
of
the
bottle
and
even
better
tonight
out
of
a
proper
glass
a
lovely
copper
colored
ale
with
a
nice
but
not
thick
head
an
even
malty
sweet
aroma
greets
you
with
the
first
sip
and
stays
throughout
the
whole
glass
the
taste
is
excellently
balanced
between
a
gentle
maltyness
and
a
smooth
hop
finish
im
glad
to
hear
that
this
is
now
available
year
round
praise
be
to
preacher
sir
johnnyp
for
sending
some
of
it
to
the
west
coast
very
quaffable
for
such
a
high
abv
is
it
the
holy
grail
of
strong
ales
not
in
my
book
but
its
pretty
darn
good
note
i
tried
this
off
the
shelf
in
august
2003
as
it
is
a
seasonal
brew
i
have
to
add
that
it
certainly
held
its
character
beyond
the
march
date
mentioned
on
the
brewers
website
by
the
way
there
was
no
date
on
my
bottle
magic
in
a
glass
rich
barley
sweetness
at
the
start
yet
quite
soft
and
approachable
some
nice
delicate
spicyness
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
toffee
quite
a
hoppy
bitterish
finish
quite
alright
this
was
the
last
of
the
night
perhaps
it
didnt
benefit
as
much
as
it
could
have
because
of
this
very
reason
still
a
nice
tasty
strong
ale
a
very
violent
pour
is
the
only
way
to
get
a
lasting
head
on
this
puppy
the
buttery
flavors
of
the
ringwood
are
strongly
dominant
and
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
malts
and
hops
are
diminished
because
of
it
there
are
some
interesting
fruity
undercurrents
some
intriguing
spiciness
which
i
think
is
derived
from
the
alcohol
and
the
malts
if
you
can
discern
them
buried
underneath
all
the
butterscotch
are
sturdy
salty
and
delicious
i
would
love
a
bit
more
crispness
from
a
more
forceful
hop
presence
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
a
fair
amount
of
hoppiness
but
im
not
getting
any
of
it
the
sweetness
and
butteriness
of
this
beer
gets
cloying
especially
as
it
warms
i
preferred
it
at
a
cold
rightoutofthefridge
temperature
unusual
for
this
style
of
beer
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
it
is
overrated
that
said
it
does
grow
on
you
and
each
bottle
tastes
better
than
the
last
perhaps
a
fresher
bottle
or
a
caskconditioned
pint
or
even
a
more
wintery
setting
would
enlighten
me
as
to
why
this
beer
basks
in
universal
acclaim
pours
a
nice
amber
color
nose
is
very
inviting
a
bit
of
whiskey
some
bing
cherries
and
even
some
leather
and
mustiness
body
is
thick
and
firm
but
easy
drinking
about
perfect
feels
good
in
the
mouth
like
it
was
meant
for
me
to
drink
a
sixpack
of
this
tonight
although
i
only
have
one
which
is
a
probably
a
good
thing
a
verynice
flavor
to
match
the
nose
although
slightly
weaker
than
the
nose
same
elements
sweet

finsihes
with
a
nice
twang

that
throws
this

into

a
very
enjoyable

one
of
the
more
drinkable
barley
wines
ive
had
a
guy
could
get
in
trouble
with
this
a
lot
of
character
with
this
beer
but
a
high

as
well

to

for
providing
this
memorable
beer
this
strong
ale
poured
a
clear

brown
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
was
persistent
the
carbonation
was
lively
the
smell
was
citrusy
floral

and
sweet

very
nice
the
taste
was
sweet
caramel
malt
and
strong
floral
hops
with
a
little
biscuit
thrown
in
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
hoppy
with

very
nice

the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
was
a
very

that
left

the

thanks
to
mainebeerman
for
the
sample
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
an
ambercedar
woodruby
color
that
was
clear
the
head
was
thick
and
creamy
the
color
that
was
produced
was
a
french
vanilla
crème
that
was
fairly
sticky
and
left
a
sticky
lace
behind
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
malts
sweet
fruits
berries
slight
oranges
caramel
light
flowers
and
i
also
noticed
a
very
very
very
slight
metallic
hint
at
the
end
not
horrible
just
there
the
flavors
that
came
from
the
beer
were
of
dark
fruits
berries
plums
and
some
raisins
caramel
hops
sweet
malt
flowers
and
a
creamy
sensation
like
you
get
from
butter
this
beer
was
surprisingly
complex
when
the
first
pour
and
sip
was
taken
i
thought
it
was
fairly
simple
but
the
more
i
poured
and
tasted
the
flavors
seemed
to
arise
and
become
more
complex
a
good
beer
it
surprised
me
from
top
to
bottom
of
bottle
very
well
balanced

is
capped
by
a
thin

creamy

that

quite
well

the

displays
a
lightly
buttery

some
nice

berries
citrus
peel
and
a
touch
of
hops
fuggles
its
medium
bodied
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
that
caresses
the
tongue
very
nice
a
rich
maltiness
that
seems
to
derive
from
the
maris
otter
varity
dominates
the
flavor
its
caramelish
with
a
mild
touch
of
butter
fruity
with
light
notes
of
orange
green
raisins
plums
and
cherry
and
a
touch
of
licorice
thats
probably
created
through
a
combination
of
sweetish
malt
and
a
somewhat
minty
hop
flavor
its
rich
malt
is
balanced
by
a
bold
bitterness
and
it
lays
on
the
tongue
in
a
long
finish
with
malt
hops
and
fruit
all
making
an
appearance
nicely
complex
this

tint
of

dry

with
a

dry
hopped
for
good
measure
the
maltiness
rolls
forward
throughout
the
glass
and
begins
to
reveals
a
trace
of
berries
and
some
smoothness
an
unusual
but
nice
pine
essence
is
long
lasting
the
alcohol
is
noticed
though
not
overly
so
the
creamy
beige
head
lingers
and
nice
lace
is
formed
as
with
all
of

there
sort
of
a
raw
wildness

smell
was
wonderful
with
some
floral

sip
gives
a
hint
of

with
a
some
hoppiness
hidining
the
background
that
is
present
after
holding
in
the
mouth
at
different
times
i
thought
i
tasted
some
nutty
flavor
or
some
pepper
the
high
alcohol
is
sneaky
but
a
warming
sensation
is
noticeable
after
a
while
i
just
got
a
six
pack
and
am
thinking
of
cellaring
a
few
but
there
really
isnt
an
edge
to
pull
of
this
one
it
is
pretty
drinkable
as
is
aged
a
year
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
alas
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
poured
with

flavors
are
most
apparent
the
hops
take
a
back
seat
in
this
brew
slightly
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
not
bad
but
i
think
there
are
many
more
flavorful
barleywines
to
be
had
the
alchohol
was
notably
present
in
the
taste
this
ale
poured
a
redbrown
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
malty
sweetness
featuring
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
was
much
milder
than
many
of
the
strong
ales
i
have
had
and
only
a
bit
of
barleywine
sweetness
showed
through
as
soon
as
i
thought
the
sweetness
might
be
too
much
the
hops
kicked
in
and
balanced
the
whole
thing
out
while
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
by
hsa
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
good
winter
ale
still
not
too
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
had
it
at
redbones
on
tap
pours
a
deep
copper
color
does
not
really
taste
like
an
ale
but
does
have
a
pretty
intense
alcohol
ithad
a
taste
that
i
just
could
not
put
my
finger
on
a
taste
that
i
was
not
too
thrilled
about
definitely
got
better
as
i
kept
drinking
it
heavy
malt
and
caramel
flavor
burned

maybe
that
was
the
taste

it
tastes
even
stronger
it
has
a
soft

feel
and
leaves
a

sensation
on
the

not
a
bad
drink
better
than
most
however
it
is
not
my
first
choice
of
barley
wines
or
strong
winter
ales
i
have
only
had
their
summer
ale
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
i
must
admit
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
it
the
smooth
pour
revealed
a
beautiful
dark
amber
hue
that
had
a
thin
white
styrofoamy
head
that
clung
to
the
side
of
my
glass
all
the
way
down
the
smell
was
very
arousing
with
scents
of
a
sweet
caramel
balanced
with
a
salty
teriyaki
like
smell
the
taste
was
very
dry

the
aroma
of
maple

butterscotch
misled
me
into
thinking
it
would
taste
sweeter

with
a
sweet

taste
then
a
hint
of

and
caramel
hold
for
awhile
until
it
balances
out
with
a
dry

it

i

still
one
of
my
favorites

i
wish

would
make
it

definitely
much
better

a

might
be
interesting
a
balanced
beer
to
say
the
least
with
both
a
distinct
malty
and
hoppy
flavour
very
smooth
very
drinkable
and
very
alcoholic
on
the
breath
cant
really
go
wrong
with
a
beer
like
this
unless
you
cant
handle
a
ringwood
beer
but
its
wellblended
into
the
mix
one
of
my
favourites
and
one
of
gearys
best
beers
imo
special
indeed
this
is
a
disappointment
love
the
ads
brewed
only
while
the
weather
sucks
or
something
like
that
there
are
much
better
winter
beers
just
not
what
i
expected
notes
year
after
year
this
one
is
a
sure
thing
for
winter
seasonals
bitterness
seems
a
step
up
this
year
which
is
fine
considering
all
of
the
malt
flavour
to
deal
with
this
is
as
close
to
a
session
beer
as
you
can
get
at
7
abv
its
a
really
nice
feeling
beer
on
the
palate
and
the
toasty
biscuit
flavor
is
delicious
i
didnt
like
the
minerally
hard
water
flavors
though
you
can
actually
smell
this
too
and
i
think
the
hops
could
be
more
up
front
still
a
very
good
winter
brew
wow
this
guy
does
a
few
beers
and
does
them
well
this
is
the
showcase
beer
for
this
brewery
a
strong
ale
that
gives
off
malt
and
hop
aromas
rather
than
booze
fumes
mouthfeel
is
perfect
in
my
opinion
too
often
these
types
of
ales
are
sticky
or
too
heavily
bodied
highly
recommended
easily
their
worst
beer
not
good
at
all
another
fantastic
dfh
beer
i
think
this
beer
needs
to
be
aged
2
years
to
bring
out
its
full
potential
rich
and
viscous
beautifully
aged
2009
bottle
drank
in
2014
this
beer
stands
out
at
its
peak
as
a
beautifully
unique
deity
of
beers
the
maple
and
vanilla
are
so
heavy
and
rich
yet
so
smooth
and
not
overpowering
the
smoke
is
beautifully
present
yet
subtle
the
beer
is
a
work
of
art
at
this
point
in
its
age
its
a
5
at
this
point
overall
several
different
flavors
coming
together
on
this
beer
and
its
executed
quite
well
the
syrupy
sweetness
balances
well
w
vanillacaramel
creaminess
oakiness
and
bitter
fruits
create
a
nice
counterbalance
to
the
sweetness
nice
smoky
undertones
a
real
pleasent
and
warming
sipper
smoke
flavor
came
through
pretty
strong
and
i
do
not
like
smoked
beers
not
very
tasty
even
after
i
let
it
open
up
a
little
dogfish
head
usually
knocks
them
out
of
the
park
just
not
this
time
12oz
bottle
2012
aged
one
year
pours
a
slight
cloudy
rich
copper
amber
with
a
quickly
fading
razor
thin
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
fruity
some
toasted
vanilla
oaked
essence
and
dark
fruit
and
mild
maple
notes
some
smokey
notes
as
well
taste
the
same
as
aroma
with
a
bit
of
earthy
herbal
hops
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
brandy
like
notes
in
the
flavor
the
palate
is
a
full
and
rich
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
there
is
some
bubble
effervescence
finish
is
the
same
as
taste
with
some
smoked
flavors
as
it
warms
up
with
a
lingering
brandy
like
sweetness
and
mild
bitterness
on
the
end
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
barley
wines
as
this
is
labeled
but
very
good
overall
a
very
good
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
bw
very
nice
i
feel
immortal
already
enjoy
almost
a
rauchbier
to
me
i
get
loads
of
earthy
smoke
and
oak
o
excellent
highly
recommended
sip
and
savor
highly
recommended
for
any
kind
of
drinking
but
was
a
very
good
choice
for
aging
cheers
overall
i
think
i
would
like
this
beer
immensely
if
it
werent
for
the
smoked
malts
the
syrup
and
sweet
aspects
work
well
with
the
barrel
aspect
i
just
cant
get
the
balance
between
them
and
the
smoked
malt
overall
a
very
good
warmer
but
i
would
love
to
see
what
a
year
or
two
does
to
this
this
is
a
big
beer
with
levels
of
complexity
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
starts
out
almost
like
a
red
but
finishes
with
wood
there
was
a
serious
defect
in
the
batch
i
had
tasting
of
the
adhesive
used
in
bandaids
i
would
however
be
willing
to
try
it
again
to
reevaluate
my
score
i
would
also
appreciate
some
feedback
from
those
who
had
a
good
experience
with
this
beer
or
the
same
experience
i
had
bottle
dated
12714
beer
pours
deep
amber
with
minor
foam
ring
around
head
nose
is
lightly
fruity
mixed
with
some
earthiness
flavor
is
smoke
and
earth
rich
and
developed
with
a
smoky
tart
sweetness
rounding
out
mouthfeel
is
silky
not
too
heavy
or
boozy
for
a
strong
ale
overall
a
sipper
reminds
me
of
a
cognac
or
whiskey
o
when
i
purchased
my
4
pack
its
contents
were
already
about
5
months
old
i
wont
say
i
disliked
it
but
i
like
many
of
dogfishes
other
brews
much
better
but
i
saved
one
bottle
and
i
will
be
cellaring
it
for
another
6
months
at
which
point
im
hoping
i
will
enjoy
this
one
better
recommended
vintage
fresh1
year
both
are
fantastic
very
nice
brown
color
small
head
adequate
lacing
overpowering
smokey
taste
hides
a
sweet
aftertaste
not
my
favorite
and
i
am
usually
a
dogfish
head
fan
way
too
smokey
for
me
i
will
not
buy
again
one
thing
the
smoke
taste
is
hide
the
alcohol
which
is
saying
something
as
it
comes
in
at
a
whopping
11
o
rich
delicious
and
flavorful
overall
not
as
much
woody
notes
as
i
was
expecting
but
the
booze
is
well
hidden
for
a
11
abv
brew
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
peatyscotchy
type
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
decent
not
something
id
pick
up
again
though
o
definitely
a
sipper
in
a
blind
multiple
choice
test
i
might
just
finger
this
as
a
dfh
brew
has
a
certain
something
about
it
almost
tastes
like
an
extra
special
version
of
their
raison
detre
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
abv
greatest
dimension
of
flavor
might
be
best
at
89
instead
i
dunno
it
does
get
better
with
each
sip
more
subtleties
unfold
perhaps
this
is
best
consumed
at
room
temp
huh
overall
at
first
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
smoke
but
it
blended
well
together
with
everything
else
in
the
beer
pretty
solid
for
a
high
abv
beer
too
ill
revisit
this
one
again
oa
delicious
brew
that
aged
very
well
for
those
that
dont
enjoy
the
flavor
of
peat
this
beer
is
not
for
you
for
those
who
like
a
touch
of
smoke
this
is
possibly
the
best
peated
beer
ive
had
none
of
the
flavors
overpower
theother
and
the
smooth
interplay
of
the
oak
vanilla
peat
and
maple
syrup
making
this
a
delicious
sipping
beer
overall
somehow
there
is
a
boldness
and
almost
a
brightness
to
these
flavors
this
is
a
very
big
beer
yet
the
flavors
are
assertive
and
bold
without
being
heavy
this
is
really
an
amazing
brew
very
balanced
and
complex
you
really
need
to
try
this
an
unexpected
combo
of
flavors
that
works
so
well
a
must
try
excellent
cellar
choice
much
better
than
when
fresh
its
amazing
what
five
years
has
done
to
the
flavor
cheers
unique
beer
with
a
confusing
taste
a
bit
overly
sweet
but
still
interesting
sipper
worth
trying
grabbed
this
for
half
price
at
roast
house
cappy
hour
what
a
deal
outstanding
looking
beer
with
smell
that
was
good
boozy
excellent
taste
did
not
taste
overly
strong
and
had
a
great
flavor
overall
a
very
good
beer
would
get
at
cappy
hour
again
o
for
such
an
offkilter
unique
brew
my
straight
3
75
rating
seems
bland
and
doesnt
tell
the
full
story
on
the
plus
side
this
beer
is
unlike
any
other
and
has
some
notes
that
would
be
highly
appealing
to
a
certain
crowd
liking
peat
in
your
whiskey
is
a
good
start
on
the
bad
side
there
is
not
much
to
compel
another
immediate
swig
again
whiskey
sippers
might
feel
at
home
i
could
barely
detect
anything
but
smoke
and
alcohol
certainly
not
the
luscious
from
the
label
beer
i
was
expecting
good
as
part
of
a
flight
but
hard
to
finish
by
oneself
maybe
pick
it
up
rich
and
sticky
though
fairly
easy
to
sip
roasty
chicory
leather
dried
plums
maple
sap
traces
of
oak
and
grape
must
a
mild
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
full
bodied
with
considerable
alcohol
content
though
not
especially
boozy
and
still
relatively
balanced
overall
this
was
pretty
good
and
seems
to
be
widely
available
poured
into
a
snifter
straight
out
of
the
fridge
pours

beatutiful
flame

it

amazing

great

english
strong

cheers
o
interesting
brew
i
dont
love
it
but
then
again
its
heavy
on
the
peat
flavors
which
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
i
had
high
expectations
because
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
similar
to
palo
santo
maroon
which
it
is
not
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
probably
buy
again
overall
while
there
is
plenty
going
on
here
it
doesnt
all
work
together
to
make
a
complete
whole
the
various
adjuncts
all
make
themselves
known
in
a
positive
way
but
they
dont
really
work
together
in
making
the
beer
better
while
i
dont
care
for
smoked
beers
the
smoke
notes
in
immort
were
nuanced
and
enjoyable
also
the
fermentation
in
oak
tanks
contributed
some
nice
vanilla
and
toasted
wood
notes
overall
a
beer
that
should
be
tried
at
least
once
due
to
all
the
fun
adjuncts
good
but
not
great
dogfish
head

ale
3
55
pours
a
transparent
dark
orange
amber
with
with
a
thin
off
white
head
terrific
looking
beer
smell
is
juniper
maple
vanilla
smokey
oak
and
some
yeasty
funk
quite
a
bit
of
boozey
alcohol
on
the
nose
too
i
got
huge
maple
in
the
taste
but
it
is
not
overly
sweet
vanilla
smoke
and
a
hit
of
black
pepper
spice
linger
feel
is
actually
pretty
lightbodied
considering
the
style
and
abv
a
touch
syrupy
maybe
but
not
bad
moderate
light
carbonation
that
amplifies
the
subtle
spice
overall
another
crazy
unique
beer
from
dfh
and
one
that
for
me
falls
in
the
middle
of
the
success
spectrum
good
flavors
and
its
nice
to
see
maple
as
a
major
player
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
touch
boozey
but
i
cant
really
complain
for
11
interesting
beer
and
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
dogfish
o
okay
im
really
impressed
with
its
lack
of
booze
and
how
the
supposed
peat
isnt
really
that
bothersome
to
my
palate
this
has
some
elements
of
a
nice
scotch
whisky
having
said
that
its
not
quite
as
deep
as
i
like
my
big
boozy
monsters
to
be
still
this
has
great
aging
potential
even
with
its
currently
well
hidden
alcohol
o
while
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
another
well
made
beer
from
dfh
the
smoke
almost
overwhelmed
it
for
me
but
it
does
back
off
a
bit
and
if
you
liked
smoked
beers
this
is
probably
right
up
your
alley
theres
medium
to
lower
carbonation
and
a
medium
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
burnt
maple
oak
barrel
aftertaste
sticky
i
decided
to
try
this
aged
one
now
as
i
recently
picked
up
a
single
bottle
of
this
years
immort
ale
ill
be
aging
that
for
a
few
years
as
well
and
recommend
you
do
the
same
overall
solid
beer
definitely
a
niche
beer
something
i
would
have
if
i
was
craving
something
crazy
definitely
take
your
time
to
appreciate
this
beer
its
worth
sipping
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
otherwise
the
alcohol
with
kick
you
in
the
face
cheers
overall
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
it
is
a
good
beer
to
experience
as
it
warms
the
character
changes
noticeably
from
refrigerator
to
room
temperature
not
a
beer
to
drink
quickly
imho
but
one
to
linger
with
and
sip
slowly
felt
it
had
more
maple
character
than
many
beers
claiming
maple
as
a
key
flavor
one
to
have
on
hand
for
a
chilly
evening
did
not
have
fresh
so
cant
compare
but
i
dont
think
the
age
hurt
this
beer
at
all
and
it
would
hold
up
well
for
even
longer
than
the
year
i
had
it
stored
overall
a
very
enjoyable
strong
ale
for
sipping
i
am
enjoying
it
more
as
it
warms
up
maybe
next
time
i
will
let
it
sit
out
of
the
fridge
for
1520
minutes
before
opening
going
to
cellar
2
of
them
to
see
how
they
turn
out
in
a
year
or
two
overall
at
16
bucks
for
four
i
see
this
beer
as
more
of
an
investment
for
future
years
i
drank
one
and
felt
it
was
good
but
hoping
next
and
future
years
will
grow
to
great
nevertheless
a
strong
oak
syrup
flavor
that
is
a
solid
beer
on
its
own
and
worth
a
buy
o
sweet
and
oakey
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
which
warms
the
mouth
o
a
tad
too
treacley
for
me
but
enjoyable
reminded
me
of
a
j
w
lees
amped
up
to
the
ridiculous
overall
along
with
75
minute
this
beer
changes
and
gets
more
complex
with
age
the
maple
syrup
really
becomes
prominent
with
these
beers
and
is
pleasurable
to
taste
aside
from
the
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
perplexing
this
beer
is
great
and
im
glad
i
have
a
bit
more
available
o
overall
this
beer
holds
up
spectacularly
to
age
fresh
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
but
with
5
years
on
it
is
wonderful
man
oh
man
its
been
years
since
ive
tried
tracking
this
beer
down
and
failed
my
buddy
came
out
from
wi
and
picked
up
a
4pk
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
i
was
broke
that
day
after
spending
all
my
money
at
the
opening
of
torst
bar
he
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
keep
a
bottle
and
now
i
imbibe
heres
to
friends
overall
fantastic
and
very
complex
mixing
oak
notes
with
maple
syrup
and
vanilla
sweetness
slight
fruitiness
and
with
a
slight
smokiness
to
it
overall
super
strange
beer
but
id
kinda
like
it
and
would
like
to
experiment
with
aging

offering
i
am
a
big
fan
of
dogfish
heads
beers
but
his
one
was
quite
a
disappointment
it
was
so
smoky
i
would
compare
it
to
chewing
on
charcoal
as
most
of
dogfish
heads
beers
this
one
was
somewhat
pricier
than
other
beers
on
the
shelf
but
i
decided
to
go
with
it
because
i
like
to
try
beers
that
are
different
risky
beers
per
say
after
drinking
several
sips
and
allowing
it
to
breathe
my
husband
and
i
did
not
want
to
waste
what
money
we
put
into
it
so
we
just
downed
it
not
an
enjoyable
beer
not
my
cup
o
tea
o
very
tasty
and
unique
a
big
beer
with
massive
flavor
special
treat
and
nice
to
drink
once
o
sip
it
like
whiskey
as
a
night
cap
very
complex
the
brew
pours
a
dark
bronze
under
a
modest
offwhite
head
that
provides
a
solid
amount
of
lace
the
peatsmoked
barley
and
vanilla
standout
in
the
nose
but
they
do
not
overshadow
hints
of
maple
caramel
and
alcohol
the
smokiness
leads
on
the
palate
with
the
richer
malt
flavors
of
caramel
and
toasted
biscuits
joining
in
to
simmer
down
the
smokiness
as
the
beer
warms
maple
and
vanilla
flavors
begin
to
become
more
assertive
s
well
as
a
nice
little
hop
profile
in
the
finish
lighter
in
carbonation
this
11er
has
a
fairly
heavy
mouthfeel
a
great
sipper
from
the
folks
at
dfh
o
another
very
well
done
dogfish
beer
will
definitely
buy
again
m
softer
on
the
palate
than
i
recall
expected
and
wanted
for
that
matter
but
it
retains
its
flavor
and
presence
well
after
initial
contact
although
there
is
some
alcohol
heat
midway
that
fades
in
the
aftertaste
light
carbonation
dfh
says
it
ages
with
the
best
and
i
think
it
should
at
least
to
tame
the
heat
a
little
i
love
dogfish
head
brewery
but
had
i
had
a
difficult
time
with
this
one
this
beer
tastes
like
if
one
of
your
friends
left
their
chewing
tobacco
spit
in
a
cup
and
you
accidently
picked
it
up
and
drank
it
i
couldnt
think
of
any
other
way
to
describe
this
beer
i
will
never
purchase
this
again
o
its
definitely
worth
grabbing
a
single
and
trying
it
i
dont
like
smoky
beers
so
i
wont
have
this
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
another
crazy
beer
with
tons
of
wild
ingredients
from
dogfish
head
whoda
thunk
it
well
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
a
complete
convoluted
mess
with
all
of
the
ingredients
that
were
used
in
crafting
this
massive
ale
but
it
turned
out
to
be
artfully
balanced
with
hardly
any
alcohol
presence
at
all
with
an
11
beer
that
is
pretty
hard
to
do
all
of
the
components
shine
through
very
well
in
the
this
beer
and
come
to
a
very
nice
crescendo
in
the
finish
im
looking
forward
to
cellaring
a
few
bottles
of
this
to
see
how
the
ale
develops
over
time
highly
recommended
for
a
curious
drinker
who
doesnt
mind
a
big
sweet
and
contemplative
ale
drinks
smooth
and
chewy
with
a
warming
finish
not
bad
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
terribly
underrated
and
has
so
much
complexity
just
as
the
bottle
says
its
vast
in
character
the
maple
vanilla
and
oak
all
combine
to
make
such
a
wonderfully
different
brew
that
i
think
its
worth
at
least
a
1time
investment
overall
i
was
a
little
too
optimistic
going
into
this
brew
i
was
a
little
excited
to
see
something
new
i
havent
had
before
from
this
brewery
but
unfortunately
this
beer
wasnt
for
me
too
much
smokiness
and
the
maple
flavors
didnt
fit
well
along
with
slight
traces
of
vanilla
not
the
easiest
beer
to
put
down
as
it
should
for
the
abv
for
this
brew
maybe
next
time
dogfish
head
can
put
out
something
that
is
drinkable
i
highly
doubt
i
would
have
this
beer
again
and
most
likely
would
not
recommend
to
a
friend
cheers
d
an
interesting
brew
solid
and
enjoyable
all
the
way
around
with
an
absolutely
stellar
aroma
an
enjoyable
sipper
with
a
hefty
11
abv
not
my
favorite
dfh
brew
but
definately
worth
investigating
for
the
curious
ba
paid
a
little
under
4
for
a
single
bottle
at
my
local
store
that
will
split
up
any
4
or
6
pack
was
definitely
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
a
beet
ill
get
back
to
any
time
soon
if
ever
bottom
line
worth
the
scratch
to
obtain
the
experience
great
color
despite
a
noticeable
lack
of
head
smells
more
like
a
barleywine
than
anything
else
the
heat
is
pretty
apparent
definitely
doesnt
taste
like
a
barleywine
though
the
vanilla
is
nice
but
i
seem
to
recall
enjoying
this
a
lot
more
last
time
i
tried
it
probably
best
served
with
a
meal
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
too
busy
and
robust
to
just
have
on
its
own
a
lot
going
on
here
found
this
in
a
grocery
store
in
tyler
tx
and
in
my
opinion
it
was
about
as
good
as
bottled
beer
not
fresh
from
the
brewery
can
get
very
dark
rich
taste
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
excellent
balance
of
hops
and
malt
and
significant
alcohol
aroma

maybe
im

of
smoked
beers
this
one
in
particular
is
super
gamey
and
im
not
a
fan
i
wish
the
vanilla
would
be
more
present
as
well
as
the
maple
though
i
believe
the
maple
does
help
in
the
mf
ill
have
to
go
back
to
this
in
a
year
or
two
to
see
if
it
develops
for
my
liking

the

are
quickly
over
powered
by
smoke
and
maple
flavors
too
much
maple
for
me
enjoyed
having
such
a
unique
beer
and
had
a
combination
of
sweet
flavors
that
were
a
little
much
for
my
beer
tastes
the
english
strong
ale
is
one
of
those
categories
with
a
lot
of
leeway
they
can
range
from
the
stoutish
like
a
bracia
to
a
dark
ale
like
a
yorkshire
stingo

for

flavor
you
get
a
scense
of
honey
and
vanilla
flavor
not
the
best
dogfish
head
for
my
personal
taste
but
still
a
very
solid
beer
i
kinda
think
that
dogfish
head
on
a
bad
day
makes
beer
better
than
most
on
a
good
day
over
all
i
think
the
immortale
is
a
very
good
cold
weather
sippin
beer
mattkoondec
21
but
as
always
overall
another
very
unique
beer
from
the
boys
and
girls
at
dfh
i
like
it
some
may
not
but
its
tasty
and
complex
to
me
the
only
downside
on
drinkability
is
the
big
11
abv
this
isnt
a
session
beer
but
i
like
it
just
fine
how
it
is
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
32310
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
small
head
no
lacing
strong
aroma
of
berries
some
vanilla
as
well
this
thing
tastes
like
smokey
berries
aftertaste
of
cough
medicine
id
probably
rather
drink
robitussin
though
this
beer
is
not
all
that
drinkable
and
not
all
that
good
dogfish
head
is
a
hit
or
miss
brewery
this
one
is
a
miss
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
leaves
a
sticky
coating
in
the
mouth
and
although
it
has
a
nice
flavor
the
alcohol
and
mouthfeel
will
definitely
catch
up
to
you
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
think
its
a
bit
busy
i
would
rather
have
1
or
2
less
things
going
on
and
be
able
to
pick
out
the
flavors
better
d
wow
very
drinkable
at
11
i
havent
even
noticed
the
abv
this
could
be
great
on
a
cold
night
around
the
fireplace
d
very
good
considering
the
high
abv
and
dark
thick
flavors
going
by
the
taste
id
say
i
could
pound
a
4pack
of
these
with
no
problem
but
abv
and
price
are
pretty
significant
limiting
factors
d
absolutely
drinkable
but
definitely
not
a
session
beer
perfect
as
an
after
dinner
fall
winter
relaxer
packs
a
punch
this
ale
pours
a
thin
tan
head
and
dissapears
fast
the
body
is
a
cloudy
ambercopperish
the
smell
is
flat
nothing
big
slight
vanilla
big
abv
the
flavour
is
fairly
intense
big
woody
tastes
with
fruity
sweetness
and
teh
tartness
form
the
abv
you
can
taste
the
maple
in
the
front
with
a
vanilla
taste
and
some
citrus
notes
this
beer
is
juciy
and
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
quenched
not
the
best
that
dogfish
makes
but
worth
trying
wow
this
beer
is
good
im
having
it
a
bit
old
since
it
was
bottled
on
32610
and
today
is
101810
ive
only
seen
this
in
one
store
and
they
put
it
on
the
shelves
pretty
late
i
assume
anyways
it
smells
like
the
peat
smoked
barley
they
are
speaking
plus
a
thick
smell
i
guess
thats
the
maple
syrup
they
put
into
it
i
can
also
smell
a
hint
of
oak
and
vanilla
in
there
the
taste
is
like
a
scotch
ale
with
that
smoked
barley
taste
and
hints
of
oak
maple
and
vanilla
just
like
the
bottle
says
i
cannot
believe
how
well
this
11
is
masked
it
has
a
bit
of
a
thick
kind
of
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
what
do
you
expect
they
put
maple
syrup
in
it
i
can
even
taste
the
vine
like
hops
in
the
background
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
to
see
how
those
hops
are
since
obviously
they
have
subdued
because
of
the
age
i
just
cant
believe
im
never
let
down
by
this
brewery
its
not
even
all
the
hype
around
it
either
ive
just
never
tasted
beers
that
are
this
full
of
flavor
and
mask
the
alcohol
so
well
for
having
way
higher
percentages
than
your
average
beer
they
do
it
again
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
that
i
can
see
ageing
well
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
in
a
few
months
it
is
a
strong
ale
at
11
best
for
sipping
complex
and
hard
to
place
still
each
sip
reveals
more
character
another
winner
from
dfh
drinkability
is
average
yes
it
was
good
yes
id
have
another
if
offered
and
yes
id
be
trashed
after
two
in
a
night
not
to
mention
the
hefty
15
price
tag
on
this
12oz
bottle
dont
think
ill
be
spending
that
kind
of
cash
on
this
beer
again
ill
stick
to
the
much
more
interesting
fresh
version
thank
you
dpretty
drinkable
for
an
11
brew
that
is
to
say
its
easy
to
drink
1
in
a
sitting
but
thats
about
it
overall
this
brew
is
a
little
heavy
handed
in
abv
and
lacks
a
certain
complexity
i
desire
from
and
11
brew
maybe
i
should
have
let
this
one
warm
a
little
longer
so
fully
appreciate
it
theres
always
next
time
it
eventually
started
to
leave
a
buring
sensation
in
my
chest
maple
gives
an
odd
unique
taste
its
drinkable
fairly
tasty
but
idk
and
thats
all
i
can
say
this
is
the
perfect
time
to
pick
of
immort
ale
i
love
a
beer
with
a
great
story
and
sam
you
seem
to
get
me
every
time
props
to
redbrook
for
some
awesome
300
year
old
acer
saccharum
d
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
seems
to
me
to
be
in
the
same
league
as
founders
dirty
bastard
andor
backwoods
bastard
however
in
comparison
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
these
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
strong
ale
that
i
will
definitely
revisit
though
alcohol
isnt
too
strong
in
the
flavor
profile
and
doesnt
really
provide
much
warmth
in
the
feel
either
this
goes
down
way
way
too
easy
for
an
11
beer
this
just
isnt
right
thinking
one
is
all
im
gonna
do
tonight
reminds
me
of
dfhs
raisin
dextra
in
a
way
but
id
sooner
reach
for
that
than
this
beer
again
although
a
fresher
bottle
would
be
interesting
to
try
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
each
component
is
enjoyable
but
not
significant
enough
to
really
captivate
me
modestly
easy
to
drink
primarily
related
to
the
flavor
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
copper
with
little
head
smells
sweet
treacly
and
with
a
bit
of
smoke
the
taste
also
has
quite
a
bit
of
smoke
very
hot
at
the
end
and
some
bandaid
flavors
clearly
a
bit
of
infection
here
but
right
off
the
tap
at
a
fine
establishment
this
is
the
brewers
fault
not
up
to
snuff
but
the
infection
is
very
faint
and
the
standard
flavors
are
still
present
quite
hot
so
not
old
i
actually
enjoyed
this
a
bit
a
little
farther
along
would
be
a
different
matter
d
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
offers
a
myriad
of
flavours
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
considering
the
abv
personally
i
would
prefer
a
bolder
taste
the
body
is
medium
or
slightly
heavier
the
carbonation
is
fantastic
beer
feels
creamy
and
smooth
almost
velvety
wow
not
noticing
any
of
the
11
abv
on
this
one
this
is
a
beer
that
could
lead
to
a
divorce
if
you
know
what
i
mean
5th
d
a
great
brew
that
i
could
drink
anytime
what
a
great
brew
to
have
on
tap
at
a
beer
bar
a
session
brew
no
but
could
have
this
over
any
other
asa
any
day
note
this
is
my
initial
review
of
this
beer
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
am
aging
which
will
be
reviewed
on
a
later
date
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
d
for
11
this
one
is
very
drinkable
after
2
or
3
of
these
you
will
think
you
can
live
forever
it
is
a
must
try
for
those
that
want
to
try
something
differnt
and
inho
will
enjoy
d
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
this
is
a
pretty
good
unique
brew
i
would
pick
this
up
again
but
woudlnt
go
crazy
trying
to
obtain
it
dpleasantly
boozy
one
is
plenty
but
i
could
have
one
often
dfh
maybe
its
me
not
you
but
im
tired
of
being
let
down
nah
its
you
drinkable
for
the
abv
just
not
as
flavorful
as
i
had
hoped
poured
into
a
perfect
pint
this
beer
has
the
color
of
maple
syrup
with
red
and
amber
highlights
with
a
twofinger
head
it
smells
sweet
and
sugary
much
like
oak
with
maple
and
vanilla
notes
and
a
strong
malt
presence
the
oak
comes
forward
in
taste
as
well
almost
giving
it
a
smoked
characteristic
the
beer
is
very
sweet
and
malty
as
expected
from
the
smell
the
carbonation
of
the
beer
is
light
in
this
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
fairly
well
hidden
abv
if
i
werent
feeling
so
generous
on
this
night
i
wouldve
drank
the
whole
4pack
on
my
own
d
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
to
drink
too
many
of
but
this
might
just
be
the
weather
right
now
rich
and
complex
beer
that
deserved
to
be
sipped
drinkability
very
quaffable
ale
but
i
wouldnt
suggest
pouring
it
over
pancakes
as
tempting
as
it
may
be
this
is
pretty
good
and
extremely
whiskeylike
d
i
could
definitely
sit
through
a
few
bottles
of
this
one
a
pretty
good
substitute
when
im
craving
bourbon
beer
is
medium
bodied
raisins
and
plums
in
the
palate
sweetness
up
front
very
drinkable
very
good
seriously
i
thought
this
would
be
too
strong
for
me
but
im
loving
it
a
very
good
beer
barleywine
like
d
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
although
the
first
time
wasnt
that
memorable
it
did
enough
to
prompt
me
to
buy
a
second
an
interesting
beer
id
like
to
try
it
again
after
it
has
had
some
time
and
after
my
palette
grows
up
a
bit
drinkabilitythis
beer
is
so
delicious
and
drinkable
that
it
would
be
sessionable
if
not
for
the
high
abv
all
in
all
this
is
not
as
good
the
second
time
around
the
first
was
so
much
better
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
not
amazing
id
say
dont
hunt
it
down
but
try
it
if
you
have
access
to
it
notes
surprised
by
how
divisive
this
brew
seems
in
some
contexts
it
may
not
feel
outstanding
compared
to
other
offerings
but
it
sure
is
close
to
the
top
bracket
of
craft
brews
it
is
true
that
on
a
first
tasting
a
couple
of
years
ago
or
so
i
found
it
ok
but
not
too
inspiring
on
this
occasion
although
it
is
not
a
brew
to
rave
about
i
find
it
rather
pleasing
drinks
easily
immort
ale
is
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavors
blending
seamlessly
and
acting
as
an
alltooeffective
alcohol
distribution
system
it
just
might
be
my
new
favorite
from
dogfish
head
theres
alot
of
layers
going
on
and
id
love
to
buy
a
few
of
these
to
shove
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
they
develop
over
time
its
a
very
interesting
beer
definitely
unique
and
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
have
to
say
this
beer
was
a
tough
one
for
me
to
pick
out
all
the
flavors
because
they
all
blend
incredibly
well
would
be
a
good
nightcap
but
not
in
texas
in
august
i
find
it
an
enjoyable
brew
but
it
is
definitely
a
oneanddone
for
the
day
thus
it
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
youll
be
happy
to
drink
another
just
on
another
day
d
starts
off
a
bit
harsh
but
evolves
into
a
truly
pleasant
easytodrink
ale
after
about
2030min
the
beer
pours
a
amberred
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
smoke
wood
anise
fruit
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
smoke
oak
fruit
and
maple
syrup
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
very
impressed
with
that
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
formed
a
nice
2
finger
thick
head
that
quickly
disappeared
and
left
minimal
traces
of
lacing
amber
colored
and
clear
looking
smells
of
raisins
a
lot
of
raisins
pretty
detectable
alcohol
smell
as
well
but
its
not
overpowering
tastes
pretty
sweet
malty
with
vanilla
and
alcohol
is
present
as
well
much
the
same
as
the
smell
there
is
also
some
oak
tucked
away
here
with
a
sour
aftertaste
which
was
unexpected
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
definitely
a
sipper
but
an
easy
sipper
though
goes
down
very
smooth
worth
the
money
in
my
opinion
dark
ruddy
brown
in
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
yellowishwhite
head
aromas
of
vanilla
nutiness
and
a
bit
of
rumsoaked
fruit
flavor
brings
the
impression
of
caramelly
pralines
and
an
earthy
woodiness
ends
with
a
semisweet
creamy
finish
delicious
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
pours
amber
with
a
minimal
white
head
present
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
present
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
of
subtle
malt
sour
and
alcohol
it
has
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
for
one
at
this
abv
definitely
one
of
the
better
seasonals
ive
had
and
worth
trying
if
you
can
poured
brilliantly
clear
a
deep
red
hue
with
a
short
lived
off
white
head
the
nose
is
immensely
complex
with
lots
of
vanilla
oak
toffee
and
figs
a
sweet
maplebrown
sugar
aroma
too
this
is
almost
like
a
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
but
not
quite
there
is
a
raisiny
character
to
it
as
well
taste
is
however
somewhat
lacking
compared
to
the
nose
alcohol
is
prominent
with
all
the
complexities
somewhat
subdued
although
there
is
a
chocolatey
robustness
coming
around
the
raisins
lots
of
maple
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
slick
and
big
body
with
moderate
carbonation
hot
finish
id
let
this
sit
for
a
while
drinkability
a
very
flavorful
sipping
beer
that
reminds
you
of
the
woods
overall
a
decent
brew
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
sweetness
here
i
really
anticipated
more
oak
flavors
as
i
love
burton
baton
and
the
oak
profile
i
really
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
some
bitterness
to
offset
the
sweet
but
what
do
i
know
d
very
sweet
but
not
overly
and
for
11
abv
its
rather
easy
to
drink
hell
i
had
two
dogfish
heads
immort
ale
has
a
strong
character
that
could
easily
overwhelm
most
palettes
the
combination
of
oak
and
vanilla
tastes
very
similar
to
beers
with
raisins
and
other
fruit
the
beer
has
a
dark
copper
coloring
and
smells
of
a
bourbon
barrel
its
not
a
session
beer
as
exhibited
by
its
heavy
mouthfeel
and
that
it
is
sold
in
4
packs
d
i
have
tried
many
of
dfhs
wild
experiments
when
it
comes
to
unique
ingredients
and
found
that
some
of
them
fell
short
and
ingredients
got
lost
theobroma
comes
to
mind
this
on
the
other
hand
features
all
the
ingredients
mentions
and
does
so
in
an
incredibly
unique
way
glad
i
picked
this
up
would
drink
again
the
11
is
also
very
well
hidden
which
could
be
dangerous
pretty
big
disappointment
from
dfh
easily
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
from
them
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
tastes
with
a
couple
years
on
it
im
betting
it
would
be
a
lot
better
it
arrived
at
the
table
with
a
dark
brown
appearance
and
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
was
very
hoppy
with
lighter
malts
tones
there
was
a
certain
sweetness
that
i
couldnt
place
there
also
was
a
definite
smell
of
juniper
the
taste
was
very
complex
strong
hops
with
a
strong
dfh
alcoholic
bite
the
hops
were
followed
by
a
very
nice
sweetness
from
the
maple
syrup
and
juniper
berries
its
a
very
nice
medium
bodied
ale
overall
i
am
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
one
another
unique
brew
from
the
kings
of
unique
hope
to
taste
one
with
some
age
on
it
as
the
booze
was
a
bit
much
and
made
it
hard
to
imagine
enjoying
more
than
one
d
that
being
said
it
makes
a
beer
that
could
be
an
out
and
out
monster
more
refreshing
than
it
deserves
to
be
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
could
see
putting
down
two
or
more
of
these
in
a
night
and
then
not
waking
up
until
the
weekend
is
over
its
good
not
great
id
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
ive
picked
up
a
four
pack
to
age
for
a
couple
years
to
see
how
the
flavors
mellow
this
beer
suffers
from
just
having
too
much
going
on
seriously
you
can
tell
it
was
crafted
with
care
and
i
sense
both
the
vanilla
and
maple
as
ingredients
but
do
they
really
go
together
i
enjoy
drinking
it
but
find
it
painfully
complex
with
oakiness
and
sweetness
generally
speaking
i
would
prefer
something
a
little
more
simple
that
highlights
the
individual
ingredients
a
bit
more
body
is
a
mediumlight
and
the
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
to
me
throughout
the
drink
age
has
really
done
wonders
for
this
fine
brew
i
wish
i
would
have
rated
the
fresh
bottles
of
this
when
i
had
them
for
comparison
but
i
recall
it
being
quite
boozy
although
very
complex
and
malty
drinkability
not
overpowering
which
these
strong
ales
can
be
but
the
alcohol
does
give
you
a
kick
strong
pour
gets
you
a
fingers
worth
of
light
tan
head
mix
of
bubble
sizes
average
retention
at
best
same
for
the
lacing
reddish
mahogany
color
murkily
opaque
but
plenty
of
visible
bubble
beads
mild
brightening
to
zinc
orange
at
the
outermost
limits
the
nose
is
like
its
been
deep
smoked
for
a
day
or
two
charcoal
peat
moss
wood
kindling
ash
vanillin
whiskey
cane
sugar
if
it
was
meat
it
would
slide
right
off
the
bone
the
peach
apricot
and
any
other
fruit
lost
in
the
mix
same
for
any
citrus
you
could
stuff
a
pinch
of
lichens
up
your
nose
and
it
might
not
differ
too
much
fullbodied
thickly
layered
not
slothlike
however
nowhere
near
nimble
the
tar
charcoal
peat
damp
black
earth
components
overwhelming
here
its
like
being
passed
through
a
filter
that
said
honey
molasses
caramel
not
shy
about
taking
the
stage
either
lets
call
them
the
earthy
qualities
whatever
they
are
they
chain
up
the
apricot
cherry
banana
fruit
flavors
although
these
are
in
no
way
evanescent
not
much
breadiness
nor
yeastiness
brush
of
orange
peel
basically
its
like
standing
next
to
a
road
crew
laying
new
tar
in
august
d
cant
get
another
drop
down
i
like
beers
that
are
oak
aged
but
this
is
like
wood
extract
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
and
paid
5
for
the
single
but
this
is
just
terrible
d
the
smoke
is
wearing
on
me
a
little
its
tasty
and
one
bottle
is
nice
but
this
wont
be
a
regular
for
me
dogfish
head
ale
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
brew
houses
and
im
lucky
enough
to
live
within
5
minutes
of
one
the
bartender
there
suggested
this
for
me
unfortunately
it
wasnt
on
tap
but
it
was
still
an
amazing
beer
like
most
dogfish
beers
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
that
i
really
kind
of
like
a
lot
of
kick
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
all
around
great
beer
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
buying
it
every
time
i
go
there
is
the
price
at
11
a
bottle
its
right
up
there
with
their
120
in
price
and
i
still
feel
that
is
a
better
beer
however
if
you
havent
tried
it
it
is
totally
with
the
11
for
taste
you
will
not
be
disappointed
at
all
poured
deep
mahogany
with
a
large
twofinger
offwhite
head
head
settle
into
a
coating
which
lasted
til
the
end
lacing
is
there
but
light
heavy
carbonation
is
clearly
visible
nose
is
figs
dates
raisins
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
very
sweet
maple
vanilla
and
some
woodiness
spice
and
smoke
finish
tempers
the
sweetness
thank
goodness
or
it
would
be
overbearing
no
real
alcohol
burn
commensurate
with
11
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
allinall
a
decent
offering
and
one
i
will
retry
for
sure
pretty
thick
beer
heavy
mouthfeel
sweetness
lingers
on
the
finish
drinks
very
well
almost
too
well
for
the
flavors
and
abv
i
want
it
to
be
a
little
more
filling
and
satisfying
aroma
is
not
very
strong
and
though
flavor
is
great
it
could
almost
stand
to
be
richer
as
such
i
find
myself
sipping
mouthfuls
much
faster
than
i
want
to
good
beer
very
much
worth
a
try
and
for
me
definitely
speaks
to
some
of
the
flavors
i
frequently
crave
which
makes
it
one
id
keep
around
and
drink
regularly
if
i
had
it
d
much
better
than
most
of
the
other
b
ig
beers
ive
had
from
dfh
the
flavor
was
a
bit
more
controlled
and
less
in
your
face
this
to
me
is
a
novelty
beer
that
you
try
once
or
twice
like
most
of
the
other
bigger
beers
from
dfh
imo
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
compared
to
the
others
ive
had
goes
great
with
chocolate
covered
bacon
overall
this
is
another
interesting
offering
from
dogfish
head
however
like
some
of
their
others
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
once
but
cant
see
myself
returning
to
it
multiple
times
in
the
future
it
was
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
will
look
forward
to
having
it
with
some
time
to
mellow
out
i
recommend
those
who
seek
a
ton
of
flavor
in
what
i
think
is
a
mix
between
and
imperial
brown
ale
and
a
bsda
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
032910c
sampled
on
may
22
2010
it
pours
a
nice
looking
amberbrown
color
with
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
tan
head
it
has
excellent
clarity
the
aroma
is
full
of
berries
vanilla
malts
and
oak
a
decent
enough
mouthfeel
the
taste
has
a
sharp
bitterness
but
it
has
more
of
a
bareky
wine
quality
than
anything
else
it
came
across
as
too
boozy
for
my
tastes
it
is
something
to
drink
slowly
its
a
little
oily
but
as
youd
expect
from
a
big
beer
like
this
i
couldnt
see
myself
ordering
these
very
often
but
it
was
definitely
a
good
beer
experience
d
a
nice
sipping
beer
due
to
the
noticeable
alcohol
and
overall
flavors
present
notes
would
love
to
age
this
and
see
how
it
does
enjoy
and
get
it
on
from
notes
hence
the
ridiculous
straightforwardness
pours
a
mostly
clear
ruby
amber
with
nearly
no
real
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
of
raisins
figs
maple
syrup
whiskey
didnt
see
that
one
coming
and
oak
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
notes
of
raisins
whiskey
its
back
molasses
brown
sugar
nutmeg
and
stainless
steel
ever
lick
a
spoon
the
body
is
far
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
thickly
smooth
feel
it
is
a
bit
much
for
regularheavy
consumption
though
immort
ale
pours
a
nice
looking
mahogany
into
my
duvel
tulip
turns
ruby
if
held
up
to
the
light
theres
not
much
of
the
off
white
head
and
theres
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
is
largely
of
alcohol
with
some
maple
and
vanilla
lurking
in
the
background
this
isnt
promising
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
malts
but
theyre
welcome
here
because
its
something
thats
not
alcoholic
heat
as
with
the
nose
the
maple
and
bourbon
mentioned
on
the
bottle
are
ancillary
flavors
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
but
the
body
is
a
little
too
thin
for
such
a
big
beer
any
beer
this
overtly
boozy
is
going
to
be
a
slow
sipper
and
right
now
im
feeling
glad
that
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
instead
of
a
four
pack
drinkability
drinks
extraordinarily
well
for
being
11
abv
not
all
that
heavy
and
certainly
not
too
hot
or
dry
nice
snag
zach
a
bit
prickly
on
the
feel
due
to
the
carbonation
and
a
bit
lighter
than
i
thoughtwanted
it
to
be
i
guess
this
isnt
a
big
stout
or
barleywine
or
anything
so
thats
ok
decent
drink
definitely
a
different
beer
as
it
goes
on
i
think
that
it
borrows
a
bit
from
the
quad
style
some
of
the
roasted
notes
and
the
spicing
reminds
me
of
quads
glad
to
be
able
to
try
it
im
gonna
grab
a
couple
more
and
put
them
down
for
a
while
d
its
a
sipper
without
a
doubt
the
flavors
of
the
beer
are
just
so
strong
that
you
really
cant
drink
more
than
a
couple
without
getting
a
little
overwhelmed
d
i
can
understand
this
brew
getting
a
divided
reaction
dfh
often
elicits
polarizing
receptions
in
this
case
i
am
solidly
with
the
dfh
crowd
aroma
dominated
by
alcohol
oak
and
maple
syrup
medium
carbonation
initial
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
dominated
by
smokiness
that
gives
way
to
dates
raisin
malt
and
a
long
finish
of
woody
vanilla
and
more
alcohol
very
fullflavored
and
pleasant
to
sip
though
it
does
grow
quite
sweet
after
a
while
though
paradoxically
the
finish
is
actually
somewhat
bitter
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
with
decent
drinkability
overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
taste
immort
i
think
ill
get
a
few
more
bottles
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
well
polished
warming
on
the
body
and
the
soul
overall
a
decent
seasonal
brew
from
one
of
americas
best
craft
breweries
for
the
most
part
it
is
very
good
but
would
be
much
better
paired
with
a
good
food
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
an
11er
can
be
if
you
like
the
strong
ale
style
this
is
a
good
one
d
a
solid
strong
ale
it
is
smooth
yet
sweet
i
like
the
smokiness
in
this
it
gives
it
a
dynamic
edge
taste
its
just
a
tad
too
rich
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
of
it
took
me
about
an
hour
to
finish
a
sipper
for
sure
i
am
curious
how
this
ages
i
should
note
that
i
love
the
labels
on
dogfish
head
because
they
tell
you
exactly
what
the
beer
is
brewed
with
if
like
me
youre
just
starting
to
learn
about
beer
theyre
very
helpful
in
picking
out
exactly
what
that
nice
flavor
you
cant
quite
put
your
finger
on
is
coming
from
on
the
other
hand
they
may
bias
my
review
so
i
suppose
its
a
wash
final
impressions
great
woody
earthy
ale
big
complex
front
but
with
a
puzzling
tartbitter
finish
quite
the
unique
beer
as
dogfish
head
would
this
brew
would
benefit
big
time
from
some
food
accompanying
it
a
great
compliment
to
a
mostly
hoppy
and
nontraditonal
line
of
big
beers
from
dhead
made
me
crave
bacon
lightly
seasoned
pork
should
age
very
well
at
11
abv
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
tried
very
hard
i
very
much
like
the
somewhat
similar
palo
santo
and
burton
baton
is
a
stellar
example
of
why
oakaging
beer
can
be
a
great
idea
immort
ale
though
if
dfh
hadnt
already
won
me
over
with
their
other
beers
i
would
be
downright
insulted
that
i
was
charged
like
13
for
a
4pack
of
this
nonsense
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
stong
beer
overall
a
decent
effort
from
dfh
however
for
the
price
i
would
likely
not
get
another
4
pack
of
it
also
did
not
care
for
it
t
all
as
it
warmed
up
even
slightly
it
started
to
get
a
bad
medicine
taste
to
it
from
the
sweetness
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
dfh
i
respect
their
fearlessness
and
will
fearlessly
try
anything
they
offer
but
to
me
this
tasted
like
someone
was
trying
to
make
a
sweeter
scottish
ale
with
a
massive
apv
d
will
have
to
try
this
again
soon
really
was
a
great
beer
and
surprisingly
affordable
taste
is
very
intense
and
strong
theres
some
light
woodiness
and
a
fairly
sweet
and
warming
feel
to
it
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
thats
quite
creamy
with
a
very
nice
amount
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
for
quite
awhile
with
dried
fruits
here
and
a
bit
of
bready
yeastiness
abv
is
very
well
hidden
its
a
really
great
brew
and
hard
to
believe
this
was
one
of
their
first
brews
delicious
for
what
it
is
not
nearly
as
abrasive
as
many
strong
ales
and
a
top
competitor
in
the
10
category
welldone
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
11
abv
like
most
dfh
the
high
alcohol
is
well
hidden
having
just
one
of
these
in
a
night
is
enough
for
me
due
to
the
11
abv
and
the
price
for
a
four
pack
really
complex
interesting
beer
maple
licorice
vanilla
light
wood
biscuit
and
toffee
malt
light
twigginess
that
im
guessing
comes
from
the
juniper
light
citrus
hop
profile
juniper
jumps
out
as
it
warms
reminds
me
of
gin
lemon
twist
drinks
like
a
barleywine
with
a
rich
silky
body
but
hides
the
abv
extraordinarily
well
and
seems
much
more
complex
less
sweet
i
think
i
would
choose
this
one
as
a
night
cap
more
often
than
not
love
getting
into
it
glad
i
have
more
for
11
abv
this
is
crazily
drinkable
makes
for
a
wicked
nightcap
really
smooth
although
obviously
not
sessionable
overall
a
nice
off
pace
beer
that
would
never
be
in
my
regular
rotation
still
some
how
dfh
pulls
off
these
weird
beer
and
makes
them
work
this
is
no
different
d
i
could
do
2
or
3
of
these
if
cost
were
not
an
issue
but
i
dont
think
id
try
to
seek
this
out
again
still
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
always
look
forward
to
what
dfh
puts
out
tastea
lot
happening
heresmokysubtle
vanilla
earthy
hop
notespeat
moss
tobacco
maple
and
a
shapeshifting
smokiness
that
seems
to
fade
in
and
out
with
each
sip
and
this
is
a
definite
sipper
huge
character
and
very
complex
have
one
fresh
and
cellar
one
for
later
this
brew
will
definitely
give
your
tastebuds
a
wonderful
workout
dhigh
alcohol
and
high
price
doesnt
make
it
the
common
goto
beer
but
its
definitely
a
nice
treat
once
every
few
months
to
compare
aging
if
you
like
the
palo
santo
im
pretty
sure
you
will
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
d
i
put
this
in
a
perfect
pint
not
knowing
what
to
expect
this
beer
would
be
better
split
into
two
snifters
and
shared
its
one
boozy
hot
beer
notes
it
took
a
few
weeks
to
find
this
but
it
was
worth
it
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
that
i
may
put
some
time
on
to
see
how
they
turn
out
if
i
can
resist
drinking
them
for
any
great
length
of
time
pours
a
cloudy
copperamberish
color
with
light
fizzy
off
white
head
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
and
some
good
lacing
smells
of
oak
and
carmel
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
hints
of
vanilla
very
smooth
and
full
body
with
a
bit
of
a
syrup
like
finish
alcohol
is
well
hidden
as
this
beer
is
bursting
with
flavor
probably
one
of
my
favorites
beers
i
tried
so
far
poured
a
deep
amber
color
topped
off
with
a
nice
cap
of
white
foam
aromas
of
oak
vanilla
dark
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
on
the
palate
i
get
lots
of
cherries
oak
and
dark
fruit
with
some
astringency
coming
through
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
05
version
i
had
at
gabf
a
few
years
back
pours
dark
amber
with
ruby
highlights
by
accident
i
dumped
the
yeast
dregs
into
my
snifter
smells
vinous
almost
red
winelike
or
slightly
bourbon
in
character
smells
somewhat
sour
with
notes
of
plum
sour
cherry
dark
fruit
wild
yeast
tastes
similar
in
smell
although
it
tastes
slightly
sour
some
woody
notes
along
with
very
light
peat
malt
feels
mediumfull
with
alcohol
prevalent
towards
rhe
end
im
just
wondering
if
this
batch
got
innoculated
with
some
wild
yeast
or
if
a
few
years
aging
really
transformed
this
one
into
something
different
wow
completely
different
beer
than
from
what
i
remembered
the
1st
time
i
had
it
cant
wait
for
the
next
bottle
after
a
few
more
years
of
aging
while
the
oak
and
alcohol
are
certainly
pleasant
flavors
to
work
with
they
are
very
strong
however
the
other
flavors
add
a
new
dimension
to
it
this
is
a
challenging
beer
to
drink
not
because
it
tastes
bad
but
it
challenges
your
taste
you
have
to
work
to
get
all
the
flavors
out
of
it
so
it
is
not
something
to
just
drink
and
forget
well
worth
the
effort
on
the
occasion
you
want
something
to
savor
full
in
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
im
not
sure
this
is
something
id
reach
out
and
grab
on
my
own

most
hoppy
cheers
if
i
havent
impressed
upon
it
before
i
will
again
this
beer
is
really
boozy
there
is
a
very
nice
smoked
peaty
woody
roasted
quality
to
the
malts
that
makes
this
beer
very
different
and
interesting
there
are
some
vanilla
caramel
berry
flavors
that
are
quite
pronounced
there
is
a
touch
of
unripened
green
apples
too
this
beer
is
one
that
could
probably
flambe
and
it
has
that
overall
quality
to
it
there
is
a
straw
roasted
peaty
almost
very
light
scotch
quality
to
this
beer
if
nothing
else
the
beer
shows
the
extent
to
which
brewers
can
really
push
the
envelope
in
interesting
directions
this
is
worth
seeking
out
for
its
uniqueness
alone
but
it
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
lchaim
overall
a
very
solid
beer
dfh
makes
some
nice
oak
aged
beers
and
this
is
a
fine
example
i
highly
recommend
this
one
one
of
the
better
strong
ales
out
there
very
drinkable
overall
ive
had
this
beer
three
times
now
and
each
time
the
flavor
seems
to
shift
a
bit
this
time
there
was
a
good
smokey
presence
to
the
beer
whereas
with
others
in
the
past
sweet
maltiness
and
syrup
have
been
the
dominant
players
either
way
i
always
end
up
enjoying
this
offering
from
dfh
and
look
forward
to
having
more
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
good
not
much
carbonation
left
after
the
initial
head
development
drinks
pretty
easily
for
an
11
abv
its
not
overpowering
but
definitely
a
sipper
bottle
pours
with
a
fizzy
soapy
white
head
brown
body
with
good
carbonation
smell
is
very
sweet
with
some
alcohol
dark
fruit
too
malty
sweet
and
bready
not
a
lot
of
hops
but
just
enough
smoke
flavor
is
rather
light
a
perfect
amount
the
oak
maple
syrup
and
vanilla
all
come
through
to
make
a
very
balanced
and
delicious
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
m
d
ive
never
tried
a
barley
wine
that
is
so
easy
to
drink
its
vast
in
character
as
promised
a
little
different
but
interesting
enough
to
keep
my
wanting
the
next
sip
when
all
was
said
and
done
im
not
sure
if
i
had
this
beer
figured
out
in
the
end
a
big
thanks
to
adil
for
sending
this
one
my
way
drinkability
this
is
a
big
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
and
is
quite
a
heavy
drink
however
the
taste
of
the
alcohol
is
not
overbearing
and
the
drink
goes
down
quite
smoothly
i
would
definitely
enjoy
this
beverage
again
drinkability
so
not
so
great
im
all
for
pushing
the
envelope
and
they
get
credit
for
that
it
just
comes
out
a
little
weird
though
i
dont
think
its
as
bad
as
my
review
will
probably
indicate
but
the
off
flavors
are
prominent
and
tiresome
mouthfeel
is
on
the
full
side
of
medium
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
this
drinks
pretty
well
for
an
11
beer
good
balance
between
the
sweetness
of
the
maple
and
the
charred
finish
very
solid
beer
overall
although
not
really
a
standout
drinkability
is
just
average
this
was
interesting
for
the
education
and
challenge
but
id
like
a
bit
less
going
on
but
if
this
flavor
mudslide
fits
your
liking
youd
be
hard
pressed
not
to
indulge
in
another
this
was
okay
after
having
world
wide
stout
i
was
excited
about
trying
some
other
dfhs
that
i
hadnt
had
before
i
thought
this
was
too
sweet
wasnt
really
impressed
enjoyed
at
plan
b
in
simsbury
a
couple
months
back
i
found
this
to
appear
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
and
very
little
if
any
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
thick
caramel
and
alcohol
with
deep
raisin
notes
the
flavor
was
full
of
nutty
red
wine
with
lots
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
in
a
medium
bodied
finely
carbonateed
brew
not
highly
drinkable
but
quite
a
drink
just
another
high
quality
effort
from
dfh
overall
impressions
interesting
complex
flavors
not
something
i
would
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
probably
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
but
i
am
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
just
not
really
a
great
match
for
my
palate
the
drinkability
is
good
because
it
tastes
good
but
is
very
alcoholic
forward
in
the
mouthfeels
having
this
alongside
the
09
the
09
was
much
hotter
and
not
nearly
as
well
integrated
maple
notes
were
much
more
prevalent
in
the
2008
this
review
reflects
the
2008
this
is
a
delicious
beer
certainly
one
of
my
dfh
faves
aging
notes
the
2008
vintage
was
much
better
overall
than
the
2009
when
fresh
its
a
bit
hot
and
boozy
with
a
lot
going
on
after
a
year
the
beer
was
still
big
but
not
overwhelming
the
flavors
were
easier
to
detect
and
didnt
seemed
muddled
d
fairly
drinkable
the
flavors
are
strong
so
if
you
have
to
enjoy
them
it
drink
this
beer
also
the
abv
is
high
but
well
hidden
overall
its
a
great
beer
worth
a
try
reviewed
by
daniel
ended
my
session
at
monks
with
this
and
wha
a
great
choice
big
but
not
overbearing
a
great
beer
overall
was
expecting
a
little
better
not
bad
i
like
big
beer
but
wthe
high
booziness
and
thin
mouthfeel
might
as
well
just
have
brandy
in
the
brandy
snifter
a
12
ounce
bottle
yanked
from
my
cellar
bottled
on
40606
poured
into
my
basic
snifter
glass
immort
appears
a
hazed
crimson
chestnut
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
tan
foam
the
head
has
good
staying
power
lasting
almost
half
way
through
the
glass
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
vanilla
just
about
the
right
amount
of
smoke
oak
dark
brown
sugar
molasses
light
notes
of
cocoa
raisins
and
figs
approaching
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
levels
this
ale
is
coming
along
quite
nicely
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
down
there
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
contained
two
of
my
favorite
odditiesspecialties
smoked
malt
and
juniper
however
they
didnt
go
together
as
well
as
id
hoped
still
its
worth
a
shot
very
powerful
good
but
i
cant
have
too
much
or
too
often
d
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
i
tend
to
think
dfhs
pursuit
of
extreme
beer
styles
as
a
selfparody
but
they
do
produce
some
pretty
decent
brews
id
say
this
is
one
beer
3
in
my
week
of
dfh
tastings
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
less
than
a
fingers
worth
of
head
that
faded
quickly
smells
of
chocolate
slightly
medicinal
most
likely
due
to
the
alcohol
and
faint
hints
of
woodiness
this
beer
starts
out
thick
and
heavy
on
your
pallet
before
a
lot
of
competing
flavors
start
making
their
presence
known
mild
bitterness
some
smokiness
and
a
lot
of
body
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
the
finish
is
mildly
astringent
and
slightly
bitter
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
quite
well
per
tasty
d
this
was
a
sipper
but
drinkability
benefited
from
the
fact
that
it
tasted
so
damn
good
drinkability
this
is
tasty
but
its
one
to
savor
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
does
go
down
well
sliding
into
your
throat
with
a
bit
of
a
resiny
feel
to
it
even
with
the
big
bourbon
flavor
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
tamed
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
for
all
things
considered
a
well
done
beer
i
would
have
this
again
and
would
love
to
age
it
ho
boy
this
heah
is
a
thang
to
be
reckoned
with
a
friend
was
both
kind
and
sharp
enough
to
remind
me
it
was
one
of
my
dads
favs
it
was
poured
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
head
that
just
sat
there
for
a
while
before
fading
to
a
nice
fuzzy
coating
on
top
and
lots
of
great
lace
color
is
a
clear
dark
amber
aroma
is
malty
smokey
dark
fruits
toffee
caramel
and
wickedly
enticing
flavors
very
similar
but
plainly
the
work
of
satan
i
go
happily
to
my
doom
with
this
beer
yammy
body
is
uh
divine
easy
to
get
in
trouble
with
this
brew
get
behind
me
satan
sooo
tasty
d
its
tough
to
knock
points
off
of
drinkability
solely
because
of
the
high
abv
but
the
alcohol
for
this
is
not
well
hidden
compared
to
some
others
overall
this
was
a
complex
brew
worth
trying
certainly
worth
a
try
this
seems
to
be
an
almost
perfect
interpretation
of
the
jw
lees
harvest
ales
a
delicious
desert
beer
one
of
my
preferred
dfh
brews
this
bottle
has
been
aged
for
over
a
year
pours
a
dark
copper
with
3
8764
inch
head
smells
like
a
smoky
peat
bog
with
oak
and
maple
syrup
taste
very
sweet
sugar
maple
and
oak
trees
smoke
and
brown
sugar
pretty
thick
body
and
high
levels
of
stickiness
quite
delicious
but
one
bottle
is
sufficient
pours
a
iced
tea
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
or
lace
smells
of
alcohol
caramel
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
and
the
alcohol
is
up
front
and
center
has
a
sweet
flavor
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
are
also
present
this
beer
is
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
it
smacks
the
taste
buds
in
a
good
way
this
is
nicely
drinkable
even
though
the
alcohol
is
high
overall
one
of
the
better
dfh
beers
ive
tried
and
one
thats
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
a
great
brew
flavors
meld
well
together
and
i
will
definitely
put
some
age
on
the
other
bottles
d
this
is
definately
a
treat
i
can
see
this
aging
beautifully
and
i
look
forward
to
updating
my
review
after
it
has
for
an
11
the
alcohol
was
very
nicely
hidden
this
is
a
quality
nightcap
and
has
many
interesting
qualities
a
fun
review
d
a
nice
postdinner
sipper
i
could
enjoy
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
probably
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
too
d
one
maybe
less
than
one
is
enough
for
me
dogfish
head
isnt
always
great
but
theyre
rarely
boring
moderately
drinkable
i
could
have
a
couple
but
probably
wouldnt
choose
to
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
one
finger
head
and
some
good
carbonation
the
head
disappears
quickly
leaving
just
a
blanket
on
top
of
the
beer
no
really
apparent
lacing
in
the
beer
smells
very
sweet
with
some
dark
fruits
oak
and
definitely
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
of
oak
very
sweet
alcohol
maybe
some
wine
and
some
vanilla
very
complex
unlike
anything
i
have
really
had
before
wood
taste
is
a
bit
overpowering
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
smoke
taste
on
the
beer
too
the
taste
is
not
my
style
mouthfeel
is
good
creamy
and
medium
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
and
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
low
for
me
on
this
one
because
of
the
smokey
flavor
and
the
alcohol
warming
both
get
a
bit
old
after
a
while
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
this
beer
but
interesting
after
all
d
extremely
drinkable
for
an
eleven
percent
beer
i
could
get
lost
in
this
poured
into
a
snifter
a
little
lacing
has
an
amber
color
to
it
maybe
a
tad
darker
has
a
strong
but
sweet
smell
has
some
alcohol
to
it
for
sure
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
for
taste
followed
by
a
sweet
smokey
after
taste
feels
great
on
the
tongue
kind
of
a
tart
feel
to
it
ive
tried
to
like
this
one
but
the
flavor
makes
it
something
i
cant
really
drink
a
lot
of
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
dogfish
head
is
known
for
putting
themselves
out
there
with
some
crazy
and
wild
beers
some
are
simply
awesome
like
the
120
minute
ipa
and
others
like
chateau
jiahu
fall
a
bit
flat
and
just
make
it
as
average
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
in
my
humble
opinion
one
of
their
best
the
malt
profile
is
very
complex
yet
melds
well
with
the
wood
character
and
alcohol
d
okay
but
not
really
for
me
the
beer
looks
alright
smells
terrific
but
the
taste
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
12
oz
that
said
i
wouldnt
mind
cellaring
one
for
a
few
years
and
trying
it
again
d
complex
flavor
profile
and
high
abv
put
this
as
a
once
in
a
while
type
brew
drinks
incredibly
well
at
11
the
vanilla
and
maple
make
very
little
booze
taste
on
this
strong
ale
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
one
and
wishing
i
bought
more
than
just
one
when
i
spied
it
d
drinkable
but
way
too
heavyhanded
with
the
smoke
the
value
is
just
not
there
and
i
wont
be
cellaring
any
of
this
one
im
sticking
to
olde
school
instead
is
just
too
overpowering
of
flavors
for
me
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
amber
with
nice
lasting
foam
nose
is
big
on
caramel
molasses
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
reminiscent
of
a
bourbon
barrel
beer
very
thick
and
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
on
this
bigbodied
beer
the
taste
is
very
complex
delivering
exactly
what
the
bottle
describes
maple
syrup
and
vanilla
definitely
come
through
along
with
the
big
chewy
malts
theres
a
very
present
aged
oak
vibe
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
with
a
pretty
spicy
dry
finish
this
beer
is
very
big
and
definitely
not
for
all
occasions
but
its
wonderful
as
i
sip
it
after
dinner
drinkability
what
another
excellent
brew
from
dfh
so
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
like
a
charm
i
can
easily
session
off
a
4
pack
of
these
in
one
sitting
another
reason
why
dogfish
head
is
on
top
of
its
game
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
this
this
one
is
a
creeper
another
home
run
in
the
dfh
club
drinkability
a
sipper
nice
when
it
warms
up
a
definite
keeper
in
my
fridge
overall
another
good
beer
from
dogfish
head
its
not
my
favorite
beer
from
them
but
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
that
id
drink
again
when
the
occassion
is
right
verdict
once
again
dogfish
head
have
pushed
the
boundaries
and
come
up
with
something
special
immort
ale
really
is
a
complex
and
unique
brew
but
also
probably
one
of
those
love
it
or
hate
it
beers
luckily
for
me
i
love
it
overall
a
very
solid
and
complex
beer
very
similar
to
a
barely
wine
style
definitely
worth
a
try
off
the
tap
at
american
flatbread
for
their
dogfish
event
this
beer
was
a
garnetchestnut
color
with
a
beige
head
the
retention
was
good
as
a
collar
and
thin
skim
and
it
left
curtains
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
oak
caramel
malt
sweet
malt
chocolate
malt
alcohol
esters
alcohol
heat
raisins
dark
fruit
and
light
spices
the
flavors
were
quite
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
surprisingly
clean
i
tasted
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
raisins
figs
and
dark
fruit
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
peat
smoke
on
the
end
quite
malty
but
not
misbalanced
and
the
sweetness
hid
the
alcohol
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
soft
a
challenging
complex
and
totally
typical
big
offering
from
this
maker
of
extreme
beers
highly
recommended
thanks
to
my
girlfriend
for
packing
this
bottle
into
her
luggage
back
to
minnesota
from
her
trip
to
nyc
overall
an
exellent
beer
my
favorite
strong
ale
to
date
excellent
combination
of
flavors
congrats
dogfish
this
brew
is
certainly
enjoyable
but
is
hardly
a
session
brew
i
would
treat
it
much
like
i
might
treat
a
barley
wine
or
other
strong
ale
definitely
a
new
favorite
i
hope
it
becomes
more
available
in
my
area
soon
if
you
enjoy
strong
ales
you
should
try
this
one
fantastic
bottle
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
smal
off
white
head
the
head
evaporates
quickly
has
a
sweet
aroma
of
juniper
berries
smokey
bread
touch
of
maple
syrup
i
tried
but
could
not
find
the
vanilla
has
a
good
carbination
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
robust
it
smacks
you
right
up
front
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
has
a
full
body
and
a
syrupy
texture
has
a
touch
of
sourness
to
it
a
strong
finish
with
a
good
aftertaste
d
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
this
just
might
be
the
perfect
afterdessert
drink
but
only
when
it
warms
up
to
close
to
room
temperature
dits
a
sipper
for
sure
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
will
put
one
away
to
age
drinkability
i
think
liked
it
but
its
just
not
the
best
solid
and
i
apprecitae
the
effort
d
humm
i
tried
to
drink
a
second
and
in
this
heat
i
did
not
really
want
another
one
sweet
as
malt
lol
its
a
sipper
a
very
complex
beer
that
i
enjoyed
would
be
tough
for
me
to
have
more
than
1
at
a
time
though
due
to
its
sweetness
this
is
more
than
likely
a
one
and
done
beer
but
i
really
appreciated
the
one
very
tasty
taste
is
like
chewing
on
a
vanilla
bean
roasted
on
a
cedar
plank
over
a
mesquite
bbq
pit
a
little
dash
of
scotch
whiskey
here
a
little
bit
of
homemade
vanilla
rum
over
there
the
07
sure
as
shit
beats
the
hell
outta
the
09
the
09
is
hot
and
mean
tempered
the
07
is
much
more
integrated
with
a
smoky
more
refined
wood
characteristic
the
brown
sugary
malt
sweetness
comes
out
to
play
a
bit
more
as
well
for
sure
it
is
a
beer
that
ages
gracefully
this
is
a
fine
example
of
how
americans
can
do
great
strong
dark
ales
nearly
as
tasty
as
the
belgians
d
sour
malt
a
little
maple
low
hops
aroma
not
bitter
fairly
yeasty
drinkability
not
especially
high
its
an
interesting
beer
and
its
got
a
somewhat
unique
flavor
but
for
some
reason
i
feel
like
it
should
have
been
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
the
abv
is
quite
high
so
it
definitely
has
an
effects
poured
dark
amberbrown
left
1
finger
head
then
creamy
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
nose
of
maple
vanilla
smokeyoaky
aftertaste
taste
of
maple
and
the
vanilla
but
i
loved
that
smokey
aftertaste
light
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
but
watch
out
for
that
11
abv
really
sneaks
up
on
you
dogfish
has
yet
another
winner
here
ill
recommend
it
to
all
taste
is
toffee
like
thick
sweet
definite
vanilla
smoke
the
smokiness
grows
as
you
drink
and
becomes
more
pronounced
a
roastiness
in
the
back
and
some
malt
ends
dry
and
slightly
bitter
this
beer
is
tough
to
put
in
to
any
type
of
style
guideline
so
its
hard
to
say
exactly
where
it
falls
typically
one
of
the
strengths
of
a
dfh
brew
this
one
just
seems
to
miss
the
mark
the
oak
is
a
bit
too
aggressive
for
my
liking
creating
a
somewhat
burnt
taste
that
seems
to
bury
some
of
the
other
flavors
i
would
guess
are
great
certainly
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
will
revisit
d
definite
sipper
shows
its
alcohol
and
there
is
a
ton
of
wood
future
outlook
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
pleasantly
flavorful
and
complex
and
unlike
many
barrelwood
aged
beers
ive
had
the
oak
characteristics
were
subtle
and
enjoyable
i
might
have
to
nab
a
few
of
these
to
squirrel
away
for
a
year
or
three
ill
be
picking
up
a
4
pack
of
this
very
soon
d
this
is
a
brew
that
one
is
enough
another
well
done
dfh
highly
phenolic
and
not
in
an
enjoyable
chimay
blue
kinda
way
phenols
are
molecules
which
give
those
funny
flavors
in
belgian
ales
sometimes
described
as
yeasty
sugary
or
smokey
they
are
here
due
to
the
peatsmoked
malt
as
it
warms
the
phenols
recede
into
the
background
and
the
malt
thankfully
takes
over
maple
oak
vanilla
i
taste
peated
malt
overall
not
terribly
drinkable
and
rather
expensive
this
is
a
big
sweet
beer
with
a
high
abv
its
not
to
my
taste
but
its
not
definingly
badjust
another
middling
brew
from
dogfish
head
the
mouthfeel
is
great
silky
smooth
thick
beautiful
dangerously
drinkable
as
well
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
disappointed
that
my
son
only
brought
one
from
virginia
for
me
to
try
i
really
love
this
beer
a
contemplator
for
sure
this
one
is
certainly
no
quaffer
and
more
likely
than
not
a
onebottle
sipper
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
even
served
in
small
doses
a
perfect
aperitif
first
impression
you
get
of
the
taste
is
that
is
has
a
definite
edge
to
it
it
seems
like
its
going
to
be
a
sipper
but
then
you
see
how
all
of
the
aspects
are
brought
out
the
bananamarshmellowoakiness
that
you
get
the
same
way
from
palo
santo
marron
whatever
it
is
dogfish
does
with
their
barrels
for
aging
they
need
to
keep
it
up
that
bananaoakey
flavor
blends
very
nicely
with
the
vanilla
making
for
a
very
smootjh
drink
sort
of
a
smokey
but
sweet
burntmalt
but
still
smooth
thing
going
on
very
woodey
got
a
slight
bit
of
tobacco
going
on
like
an
old
alelite
full
bodied
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
envelop
quite
as
well
as
it
could
still
despite
the
high
abv
and
so
many
things
going
on
extremely
drinkable
not
as
nice
on
the
senses
and
not
quite
as
tastycomplex
as
palo
santo
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
as
a
sipper
i
could
sip
on
this
forever
notes
well
made
but
not
subtle
pretty
aggressive
and
will
definitely
improve
with
some
age
but
will
go
flat
overall
this
is
quite
enjoyable
i
wanted
to
try
just
a
single
however
my
local
market
forced
me
to
buy
a
quadpack
no
problem
though
this
is
good
stuff
to
be
honest
dh
has
seldom
let
me
down
decent
beer
that
is
made
up
of
some
decent
parts
but
overall
this
is
a
boozy
mess
that
should
be
flagged
for
something
flagrant
i
wonder
if
another
year
or
three
in
the
cellar
would
meld
the
unwieldy
parts
together
who
knows
it
really
depends
on
how
you
serve
this
beer
but
warmer
temperatures
seem
to
bring
out
more
flavors
alcohol
is
strong
as
mentioned
by
other
reviews
and
with
some
aging
will
allow
the
other
flavors
to
show
more
its
decent
and
a
sipper
and
once
again
sam
succeeds
at
challenging
the
palate
nice
feel
its
definitely
a
sipper
i
can
imagine
it
being
much
easier
to
drink
after
some
aging
im
just
amazed
how
11
can
be
masked
so
well
in
the
nose
yet
overpower
the
taste
had
a
sample
of
this
beer
at
the
alehouse
on
tap
lets
just
say
i
like
my
peat
smoked
barley
in
my
scotch
i
think
sam
has
gone
way
overboard
with
this
brew
as
he
attempts
to
combine
the
peat
smoked
barley
taste
with
maple
syrup
and
juniper
berries
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
smoked
barley
the
aftertaste
is
maple
syrup
softened
by
the
juniper
berries
unfortunately
i
my
response
was
that
was
good
but
ill
have
a
75
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
pint
but
it
was
tasty
and
interesting
but
not
a
session
beer
at
all
maybe
just
a
sample
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
decent
head
to
it
not
much
lacing
though
surprisingly
smell
gives
off
some
vanilla
and
maple
nice
sweet
aroma
to
it
nice
full
body
and
great
mouthfeel
a
nice
creamy
beer
a
nice
woody
flavor
in
there
with
more
of
the
vanilla
and
maple
tastes
finishes
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
effect
whoa
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
kind
youd
have
to
be
careful
about
having
too
many
at
one
sitting
a
nice
sipper
its
one
of
the
stronger
dfh
offerings
ive
had
but
the
taste
is
superb
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
an
easy
to
drink
one
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
color
with
an
average
eggshell
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
brown
bready
malt
vinous
oak
and
vanilla
a
bit
boozy
the
taste
is
of
maple
sweetness
and
earthy
oak
which
intermingle
nicely
the
vanilla
chimes
in
at
times
perhaps
a
touch
rough
at
the
ends
and
boozy
there
is
enough
of
a
bitter
hop
to
add
some
balance
moderate
feel
lightly
chewy
nice
carbonation
definitely
hot
with
the
abv
could
use
some
mellowing
a
big
boozy
brew
nice
flavors
which
i
can
only
imagine
would
get
better
with
some
age
look
forward
to
trying
this
a
year
or
so
from
now
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
but
unique
in
its
own
right
i
could
see
enjoying
this
more
next
to
a
fire
on
a
cold
winters
day
than
i
am
on
this
warm
spring
evening
i
love
the
color
of
this
one
a
darker
amber
that
looks
tasty
not
much
head
on
this
one
just
some
lacing
around
the
top
the
aroma
is
sweet
as
expected
of
fruits
and
vanilla
along
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
one
has
a
lot
going
on
some
sips
you
get
the
strong
wood
flavor
but
on
most
it
is
maple
sweetness
and
malt
the
alcohol
is
there
not
bad
the
immort
ale
is
not
my
favorite
of
any
of
a
variety
of
styles
an
analogy
can
be
made
to
an
islay
scotch
in
terms
of
the
strong
oak
presence
not
bad
on
its
merits
but
also
not
a
personal
preference
note
theres
a
chance
my
bottle
was
oxidized
since
most
other
reviews
arent
nearly
as
harsh
on
this
beer
but
im
pretty
sure
i
drank
one
bottled
this
year
very
strange
d
a
single
bottle
is
definitely
drinkable
its
a
sipping
beer
that
you
can
savor
to
enjoy
the
complexity
i
wouldnt
go
for
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
overall
very
good
very
interesting
strong
beer
what
else
to
expect
from
dogfish
but
something
totally
different
d
the
description
is
thicker
than
its
actual
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
complicated
brew
and
certainly
requires
many
sips
to
deconstruct
even
a
semblance
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
that
it
has
going
on
as
far
as
drinkability
im
rating
this
relative
to
other
such
strong
ales
barleywines
for
example
and
i
find
it
easier
to
drink
than
many
in
such
tangentially
related
fields
i
like
alot
of
dogfish
offerings
but
this
one
is
very
average
and
certainly
not
worth
the
price
the
beer
color
is
a
deep
amber
with
a
light
beige
head
good
belgian
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
strong
strong
caramel
malt
with
no
hoppiness
the
flavor
of
the
beer
also
starts
off
with
caramel
and
sweet
maltiness
typical
of
a
strong
ale
the
body
is
full
and
light
carbonation
a
good
beer
but
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
because
of
the
stregnth
an
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
like
strong
english
style
ales
i
do
enjoy
it
but
not
in
the
upper
tier
for
strong
ales
barleywines
scotch
ales
ect
it
seems
like
a
want
to
be
skullsplitter
to
me
d
much
better
with
age
than
fresh
off
the
line
but
a
nice
interesting
ale
all
around
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
dt
tulip
poured
a
hazy
plum
with
a
1
5
inch
offwhite
lattelike
head
that
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
skim
generous
thick
strands
of
lacing
adhered
to
the
glass
during
the
tasting
nose
is
fairly
mild
but
suggests
dark
fruit
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
towards
the
back
taste
is
consistent
with
nose
but
some
dark
sugar
is
also
present
in
the
mix
and
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
comes
out
as
the
brew
warms
mouthfeel
is
just
shy
of
mediumbodied
and
effervescent
a
little
prickly
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
comes
out
drinkability
is
good
and
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
however
this
beers
drinkability
is
enhanced
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
ok
the
peat
was
to
sharp
at
first
but
i
adjusted
and
enjoyed
it
more
still
not
really
my
bag
i
dont
recall
but
i
may
have
another
one
will
probably
forget
about
it
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
slightly
creamy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thick
and
very
chewy
the
finish
is
bitter
and
a
tad
sweet
this
beer
is
one
heck
of
a
train
wreck
coming
the
alcohol
is
hidden
and
i
really
couldnt
tell
how
much
was
in
it
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
great
i
like
a
little
bit
more
aggressive
hops
in
my
strong
ales
d
if
youre
in
to
sweet
beers
this
is
the
beer
for
you
i
much
prefer
the
more
american
style
of
the
strong
ale
with
more
hop
presence
if
that
makes
any
sense
a
stellar
sipper
to
end
the
night
makes
the
drinkability
go
up
a
notch
recommended
to
those
who
like
the
yeast
and
that
there
sugar
chill
hazed
ruby
with
a
good
head
of
tan
foam
aroma
is
fruity
with
grapes
herbs
molasses
very
sweet
but
well
balanced
with
a
solid
hop
bitterness
and
deep
maltiness
some
tartness
up
front
matches
well
with
a
light
fruitiness
and
some
oaky
flavours
hints
of
honey
herbs
and
dark
sugars
lots
of
complex
miniflavours
i
cant
really
place
lasting
impressions
are
of
a
sweet
grapelike
flavour
with
lots
of
depth
and
balance
its
very
acidic
and
bitter
kind
of
tastes
like
a
sweet
tart
was
dropped
in
it
or
something
unique
taste
but
the
flavor
was
just
too
intense
really
enjoying
the
balance
of
oak
with
the
subtle
flavors
none
too
strong
to
pick
out
feel
and
drinkability
carbonation
is
low
and
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
as
afore
mentioned
it
warms
the
belly
and
clears
my
sinuses
maybe
its
just
me
body
is
what
id
say
is
medium
not
as
heavy
or
as
syrupy
as
the
etre
for
that
i
am
glad
it
makes
it
more
drinkable
in
my
opinion
carbonation
is
low
as
befits
a
beer
of
this
type
for
me
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
sure
were
i
to
try
to
session
it
id
get
fucked
up
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
its
any
less
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
especially
now
in
the
fallwinter
i
think
its
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
not
sure
how
id
react
to
this
one
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
i
think
that
this
one
has
pretty
much
everything
going
for
it
give
it
a
try
i
know
ill
be
coming
back
to
it
before
too
long
especially
because
i
see
this
one
to
have
a
warming
quality
which
is
perfect
for
the
now
frigid
temperatures
that
many
so
called
winter
warmers
dont
have
delicious
beer
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
perfect
balance
without
using
a
heavy
hop
content
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
very
little
head
yellowishwhite
fine
bubbles
dark
fruit
dark
woody
smell
of
medicine
bandage
alcoholy
not
too
strong
that
same
mediciney
bandage
taste
similar
taste
as
the
aroma
dark
fruit
smooth
not
like
other
barley
wines
ive
had
altogether
another
good
one
from
delaware
the
aroma
is
the
show
with
this
one
although
it
serves
as
a
solid
sipper
a
bit
too
boozey
d
this
might
not
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
err
beer
but
it
was
mine
the
taste
of
this
beer
phenomenal
i
wish
i
could
get
it
here
a
nice
reddish
orange
brew
with
a
decent
head
and
active
carbonation
the
smell
is
grapefruit
and
lemons
this
beer
has
been
aging
for
a
couple
years
and
is
still
pretty
sharp
the
abv
really
shows
and
i
wouldnt
try
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
a
tad
overkill
as
is
the
case
sometimes
with
dfhs
bigger
beers
worth
a
trycertainlyand
im
sure
ill
try
more
still
it
fails
to
provide
the
i
gotta
get
another
one
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
bigtime
beers
worthy
of
significant
ba
attention
d
hmmm
decent
beer
but
as
far
as
drinkability
its
average
high
abv
and
thick
mf
huge
thanks
to
johngalt1
for
throwing
this
one
in
as
an
extra
great
trader
poured
into
a
snifter
for
a
dark
brown
body
with
onefinger
tan
head
that
left
lace
patches
everywhere
a
smoky
and
roasted
malt
presence
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
sweet
malts
smells
thick
and
fullbodied
viscous
even
to
the
degree
of
sticky
and
syrupy
roasted
toasted
carame
burnt
chocolate
malt
sensations
hit
my
tongue
as
it
passes
for
a
sweet
and
perplexing
taste
and
the
minor
hop
presence
balances
it
out
for
a
drying
backbite
i
had
no
idea
this
beer
was
11
abv
until
i
saw
the
label
they
hid
it
that
well
this
a
definite
sipper
that
smoothes
out
even
more
as
it
warms
d
yum
yum
yum
yum
this
is
surprisingly
smooth
for
the
alc
content
11
it
would
be
hard
to
to
do
a
whole
night
of
these
but
thats
because
youd
pass
out
before
the
sixer
was
gone
say
hello
to
a
sharpie
phallic
on
your
face
saw
this
little
gem
at
my
local
beer
store
and
had
to
pick
it
up
just
cause
the
name
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
other
than
its
gonna
be
high
in
alchol
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
amber
brown
color
very
little
head
that
went
away
almost
instantly
minimal
carbonation
which
is
prolly
a
good
thing
for
this
beer
the
smell
is
pretty
pleasent
smells
like
a
good
whiskey
lots
of
alcohol
some
wood
or
even
smoked
wood
malts
oak
and
maybe
a
little
maple
syrup
the
taste
is
very
good
very
very
complex
and
it
gets
so
much
better
as
it
gets
warmer
lots
of
the
oak
upfront
a
heavy
malt
presence
a
pleasent
alcohol
taste
and
a
little
bit
of
maple
syrup
there
so
much
more
goin
on
here
that
i
cant
put
any
words
on
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
dogfish
head
brings
it
everytime
and
this
is
no
exception
i
loved
this
one
so
much
i
put
some
away
in
the
cellar
i
think
this
one
will
age
beautifully
this
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
a
barlywine
solid
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
hence
the
aging
and
great
review
and
all
love
the
dogfish
carbonation
and
experimentation
complexity
is
the
name
of
the
game
set
this
one
back
for
at
least
a
year
ive
been
aging
these
guys
back
since
06
give
it
a
year
trust
me
two
is
better
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
slightly
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
maple
syrup
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
red
with
a
quickly
fading
tan
head
the
head
starts
strong
then
fades
to
a
dusting
and
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
wow
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
flavor
wise
there
is
a
strong
smokey
flavor
with
some
sweetness
biting
at
the
edge
of
it
that
smoke
flavor
goes
great
with
the
vanilla
flavor
the
two
together
are
magic
i
tell
you
definately
one
dogfish
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
all
the
time
this
will
never
be
confused
with
a
sessionable
beer
notes
couldnt
finish
it
too
strong
and
too
smoky
interesting
yes
but
not
for
me
even
on
a
very
cold
winter
night
but
if
you
like
whiskeyscotch
this
would
probably
be
an
enjoyable
experience
yep
its
complex
one
bottle
will
do
for
now
but
i
found
it
immensely
drinkable
what
does
that
mean
anyway
of
course
im
not
going
to
session
it
but
id
rather
have
one
of
these
than
5
boring
brown
ales
or
something
unfortunately
i
only
grabbed
one
and
will
have
to
correct
that
error
next
visit
to
the
local
dfh
supplier
tremendous
stuff
one
of
dfhs
best
cloudy
copper
pour
slightish
white
head
that
quickly
dissappated
very
malty
aromas
with
maybe
some
cherry
also
pretty
sweet
maltiness
raisins
maple
apple
cinnamon
waffle
a
stickiness
to
it
but
i
would
call
it
medium
bodied
mild
spiciness
through
the
finish
with
only
a
bit
of
tart
and
carbon
not
usually
a
huge
barleywine
fan
which
some
consider
this
but
this
was
pretty
good
for
a
strong
ale
also
pretty
good
and
worth
trying
date
consumed
16
july
2008
poured
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
big
soft
head
which
lasted
for
quite
some
time
some
lacing
on
the
glass
my
first
smell
resulted
in
huge
oak
taste
up
front
was
of
the
oak
but
as
the
beer
made
its
way
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
vanilla
came
through
nicely
very
rich
and
deep
flavor
thick
and
wholesome
mouthfeel
not
sure
if
drinkability
is
even
a
topic
for
an
11
beer
but
it
is
ery
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
strong
one
that
said
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
as
a
treat
appearance
was
very
good
with
a
long
lasting
head
the
color
is
dark
amber
with
tiny
bits
of
spice
or
yeast
floating
around
spotty
lacing
is
immediately
noticed
the
malty
aroma
is
extremely
complex
yielding
notes
of
vanilla
and
assorted
fruits
the
first
sip
wakens
you
right
up
and
is
harsh
with
strong
abv
along
with
a
strong
sweetness
i
do
not
like
strong
syrupy
sweet
beers
but
this
seems
to
mellow
out
after
a
few
sips
high
11abv
is
hidden
nicely
there
is
a
nice
balanced
carbonation
on
the
finish
to
this
fullbodies
ale
bitterness
is
moderate
and
lingers
but
is
not
overpowering
the
finish
is
dry
as
would
expect
given
the
high
abv
and
malt
content
this
brew
is
quite
drinkable
despite
its
strength
it
is
remarkably
wellcrafted
and
complex
the
taste
doesnt
reflect
the
complexities
of
the
aroma
however
this
is
no
brew
for
beginners
transparant
amber
in
color
with
a
an
offwhite
head
bouquet
of
alcohol
esters
oak
raisins
taste
is
ver
very
sweet
and
oaky
feel
is
very
very
creamy
and
a
tingling
carbonation
alcohol
is
ever
so
present
but
is
nicely
matched
with
the
sweet
and
oaky
notes
so
it
feels
somewhat
balanced
this
is
an
extreme
beer
but
the
different
characters
are
all
so
bold
that
they
play
well
together
the
flavors
and
the
alcohol
is
so
so
strong
that
this
is
a
nice
sipper
cant
have
more
than
one
pours
the
color
and
consistency
of
wonderful
vermont
maple
syrup
taste
and
smell
are
very
malty
with
some
of
that
syrup
and
alcohol
along
with
dried
fruit
has
all
the
above
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
kick
of
vanilla

winner

d
this
is
a
powerful
takenoprisoners
type
of
beer
its
complex
flavorful
and
drinkable
first
sip
and
this
is
superjammed
with
flavor
so
it
is
a
definitely
sipper
and
not
a
gulper
warms
the
body
nicely
sweet
maple
malts
greet
the
tastebuds
first
followed
by
vanilla
and
a
tinge
of
raisin
pretty
hearty
body
and
full
feeling
in
the
mouth
but
surprising
not
as
thick
as
expected
when
basing
the
myriad
of
flavors
and
complexities
it
is
packed
with
blech
pours
auburn
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
aroma
of
vanilla
wood
and
smokey
malt
i
really
did
not
like
the
taste
shoeleather
and
baseball
gloves
galore
with
dirty
socks
given
that
i
like
islay
scotch
a
lot
this
was
nothing
like
the
peat
i
was
hoping
for
very
disappointing
overall
very
unique
treat
d
flavors
linger
higher
alcohol
not
bad
but
wouldnt
want
another
overall
not
much
that
was
unique
about
this
but
i
thought
it
was
solid
md
this
one
was
alot
smoother
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
the
alcohol
is
very
prominent
and
that
keeps
me
from
having
more
than
a
few
d
not
dfhs
finest
moment
almost
solventlike
in
the
end
warming
did
not
do
it
justice
maybe
age
would
help
it
out
some
just
too
much
sugar
d
a
nice
beer
from
dfh
though
it
wasnt
exactly
what
i
expected
from
the
bottle
very
much
a
sipper
worth
a
try
d
the
potency
of
this
one
would
prevent
me
from
having
another
one
very
complex
beer
that
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
develops
over
time
check
this
one
out
if
given
the
chance
this
is
definitely
a
malt
bomb
and
has
the
body
to
prove
it
the
alcohol
content
alone
makes
this
not
very
drinkable
pretty
good
drinkability
for
such
a
high
gravity
beer
d
for
11
this
one
has
a
very
high
drinkability
you
might
even
think
youll
live
forever
easy
to
drink
the
the
consistency
and
warmth
will
let
you
savor
this
large
ale
slowly
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
in
the
middle
of
an
ohio
winter
as
with
a
lot
of
dogfish
they
tried
too
hard
and
overkilled
the
flavor
i
see
where
they
were
going
with
it
and
i
am
a
big
fan
of
most
of
their
brews
but
not
this
one
perhaps
its
the
vanilla
maple
mix
they
dont
go
well
together
though
each
comes
off
strongly
in
this
beer
it
pours
nicely
with
a
slight
head
and
smells
as
advertised
but
again
its
not
a
good
mix
of
flavors
as
with
most
dfh
beers
they
either
hit
a
home
run
or
strike
out
and
this
one
strikes
out
overall
i
find
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
i
also
applaud
dfh
for
doing
something
different
big
surprise
right
and
throwing
a
bunch
of
tasty
ingredients
into
one
beer
unfortunately
i
am
not
sure
that
they
really
all
come
through
and
in
the
end
it
really
isnt
that
much
more
unique
than
an
old
ale
as
the
weather
is
getting
a
bit
colder
outside
in
the
40s
here
now
in
atlanta
i
find
the
warming
alcohol
to
be
enjoying
we
will
see
how
this
one
holds
up
with
a
few
years
d
perfect
this
made
an
enjoyable
sipper
while
cooking
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
sweet
but
not
sugary
barrelish
but
not
pure
bourbon
and
full
and
rich
id
be
curious
to
see
how
this
one
mellows
with
age
could
be
even
more
impressie
definitely
worth
a
go

a

not

good
offering
from
dfh
as
usual
one
is
enough
for
me
though
i
got
this
while
at
the
dfh
brewpub
it
was
a
special
reserve
06
it
had
a
nice
darksyrupy
brown
color
like
the
palo
santo
marron
it
was
a
big

the
aroma
was
figs
dark

very
sweet
the
taste
was
sweet
with
a

i
had
a
hard
a
good
buzz
from
that
one
beer
it
was
served
in
a
snifter
at
cellar
temp
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
limited
drinkablitity
due
to
the
weight
of
the
beer
drinkability
is
great
for
a
sipping
brew
vastly
complex
and
rich
this
brew
provides
a
plethora
of
flavors
and
aromas
composed
into
a
liquid
masterpiece
of
malt
complexity
not
unlike
a
barleywine
or
an
eisbock
a
brew
to
be
savored
on
a
cold
night
cheers
one
of
my
personal
favs
hard
to
put
this
into
a
category
although
with
all
the
woodaged
beers
coming
out
these
days
youre
starting
to
see
more
like
it
a
benchmark
pours
a
hazy
copper
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
smells
of
alcohol
and
sweetness
the
initial
taste
hits
me
like
a
barleywine
then
the
sweet
and
high
abv
flavor
smooths
out
to
oak
and
smokeyness
finishes
like
a
nut
brown
with
smooth
malts
and
some
caramel
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
d
another
impressive
one
from
dfh
it
has
a
lot
of
kick
and
for
the
price
was
very
good
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
regular
rotation
but
maybe
during
these
upcoming
fall
and
winter
seasons
i
will
give
it
a
few
more
whirls
aging
one
is
worth
a
go
not
bad
from
dfh
interesting
how
they
blur
the
lines
between
barelywine
and
strong
ale
pours
a
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
fading
head
it
settles
to
a
ring
of
foam
it
smells
and
tastes
much
like
an
old
ale
i
can
imagine
that
people
love
to
age
this
stuff
the
label
is
pretty
descriptive
in
the
flavor
big
body
with
oak
vanilla
maple
not
as
smooth
as
a
couple
of
bigger
maltbombs
ive
had
but
it
is
smooth
nonetheless
for
a
11er
overall
nothing
mindblowing
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
age
a
few
of
these
for
a
couple
of
years
to
open
on
christmas
eve
or
something
maybe
i
will
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
by
the
fireside
on
a
cold
winter
evening
this
is
a
great
beer
for
all
times
though
im
glad
i
will
have
the
opportunity
to
get
this
again
in
a
four
pack
great
aged
and
great
fresh
d
its
quite
enjoyable
as
a
sipper
would
probably
be
tasty
with
apple
strudel
this
was
a
great
beer
but
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
this
is
a
meal
the
high
abv
and
the
almost
syrupy
sweetness
of
this
brew
makes
for
a
nice
nightcap
or
sipping
beer
but
not
something
to
drink
all
night
long
very
impressed
this
one
was
quite
an
interesting
concoctionthe
main
reason
i
ordered
it
in
the
end
however
it
seemed
like
too
much
stuff
in
one
pot
the
end
result
was
a
pretty
good
tasting
brew
but
any
one
particular
flavor
was
difficult
to
distinguish
from
peat
to
juniper
berries
to
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
i
found
it
really
difficult
to
properly
identify
what
i
was
tasting
its
still
worth
a
try
though
because
it
tastes
pretty
good
d
much
more
drinkable
now
i
could
easily
put
a
few
down
definitely
worth
aging
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
very
strong
and
sweet
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
good
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
think
if
left
to
sit
for
a
few
years
and
if
drunk
on
a
cold
winter
day
this
beer
would
be
great
in
the
middle
of
summer
this
beer
is
definately
out
of
place
but
i
just
couldnt
wait
to
try
it
oh
well
life
is
full
of
disappointments
it
could
have
been
much
much
worse
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
moderate
sized
head
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
tangy
fruits
some
hops
alcohol
with
some
vanilla
and
spices
strong
somewhat
alcoholic
sweet
and
tangy
fruity
flavor
with
a
ton
of
brown
sugars
maple
syrup
and
a
touch
of
wood
a
touch
too
sweet
and
tangy
and
this
is
definitely
not
a
hoppy
barleywine
unique
and
quite
interesting
very
good
beer
great
night
cap
beer
d
incredible
in
its
young
rough
state
i
can
only
imagine
what
13
years
would
do
to
improve
this
ale
i
will
be
cellaring
some
of
this
pronto
d
easy
to
drink
the
booze
in
this
beer
does
have
a
kick
so
this
is
one
best
served
up
at
room
temp
and
for
sipping
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
last
night
it
had
a
strong
aroma
of
maple
and
vanilla
sweetness
with
a
milder
underlying
smoke
aroma
from
the
peat
smoking
the
flavour
is
very
complex
leading
with
alcohol
malt
vanilla
and
maple
sweetness
there
is
still
an
underlying
smoke
and
woody
aroma
on
the
finish
i
found
it
very
drinkable
surprisingly
so
for
such
a
sweet
and
complex
beer
it
went
down
very
smoothly
and
it
didnt
become
harder
to
drink
as
it
warmed
either
i
was
quite
happy
to
drink
it
very
slowly
and
it
was
enjoyable
to
the
last
sip
drinkability
is
average
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
and
as
intriguing
as
it
was
i
wont
be
drinking
it
again
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
malty
milk
chocolatey
woody
smoked
meatscheeseand
has
a
faint
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
malty
chocolatey
and
woody
there
is
a
huge
presence
of
smoked
meat
or
cheese
here
it
is
a
fullbodied
alcoholic
warming
beer
this
is
a
very
complex
brew
and
very
good
i
want
another
too
sweet
making
it
tough
to
enjoy
and
even
finish
overall
i
have
to
say
it
was
better
then
i
remember
it
though
no
doubt
suffered
from
the
leakage
i
am
sure
fresh
this
would
be
awesome
still
for
11
this
was
excellent
and
i
look
forward
to
getting
it
again
on
tap
one
day
drinkability
good
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
this
ones
really
complex
i
dont
know
if
i
really
appreciated
everything
thats
allegedly
there
which
perhaps
means
there
was
a
little
too
much
going
on
in
this
beer
that
being
said
you
still
have
to
appreciate
the
thoughtcraftsmanship
that
goes
into
something
like
this
and
what
was
there
was
enjoyable
recommended
trying
what
a
joy
to
be
able
to
drink
interesting
beers
like
this
god
bless
dogfish
head
off
centered
indeed
complex
beer
dogfish
never
fails
to
suprise
me
pours
a
dark
brown
with
cranberry
when
held
in
the
light
head
sticks
around
hazing
the
top
of
the
beer
nose
is
strong
and
juicy
but
nutty
in
the
background
taste
is
smokey
and
puckering
high
alcohol
ads
spiciness
pretty
good
somewhat
unique
certainly
worth
a
try

drinkability
again
very
enjoyable
and
pleasure
to
drink
one
but
would
not
want
to
drink
this
beer
all
night
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
2
cm
of
offwhite
head
that
is
slowly
diminishing
aroma
of
maple
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
spice
initial
flavor
is
sweet
with
dark
fruits
and
maple
flavor
becomes
more
balanced
with
smoke
and
a
distance
touch
of
hops
light
carbonation
moderate
lacing
medium
body
and
tons
of
alcohol
especially
as
it
warms
overall
an
interesting
beer
as
they
all
tend
to
be
from
dogfish
head
boy
is
this
baby
thick
like
a
milkshake
slow
whiskey
burn
on
the
way
down
it
is
superheavy
maple
vanilla
really
do
balance
not
only
each
other
but
also
the
alcohol
and
the
oak
as
well
its
delicious
but
i
can
have
one
basically
every
6
months
if
not
for
the
high
alcohol
content
this
could
be
my
number
one
beer
as
it
is
that
makes
it
all
the
more
enjoyable
since
ill
only
drink
it
every
now
and
then
d
the
sweet
and
spicydry
flavors
and
aromas
do
a
fantastic
job
of
masking
the
11
of
this
beer
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
i
started
to
feel
it
not
so
much
a
buzz
per
se
more
like
a
slowly
intensifying
heat
in
my
face
i
must
say
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
11
abv
this
is
terribly
drinkable
im
really
enjoying
this
brew
another
jobwelldone
for
the
dogfish
head
people
the
highest
praise
dogfish
has
outdone
themselves
once
again
a
faint
smell
of
blackberry
soda
and
plum
humbly
float
over
a
silk
lace
head
the
syrupy
body
is
well
balanced
with
a
crip
delivery
that
fades
to
a
whisp
of
oak
smoke
a
bouquet
of
fermented
fruit
demands
respect
and
i
am
seduced
to
raise
my
snifter
slower
and
gently
reminded
to
sip
a
little
less
what
a
grand
ale
reigning
supreme
alongside
a
handfull
of
its
elder
european
brethren
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
the
stomach
stands
to
attention
knowing
a
powerful
force
has
entered
a
well
orchestrated
whirlwind
that
sedates
the
palate
and
leaves
the
drinker
comfortably
numb
i
will
not
dare
to
insult
or
inquire
further
immort
ale
commands
me
to
be
quiet
i
have
no
choice
but
to
sit
in
silence
and
listen
nice
tasty
just
didnt
blow
me
away
2010
again
the
smoke
has
become
overwhelming
you
barely
taste
the
other
characteristics
not
very
good
anymore
drinkability
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
on
the
strangest
ales
ive
ever
tried
but
i
found
it
pretty
satisfying
not
something
i
would
drink
3
or
4
of
but
i
could
handle
one
every
now
and
again
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
and
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
however
this
didnt
quite
live
up
to
its
potential
for
me
and
dfh
has
set
the
bar
quite
high
for
itself
pours
a
deep
brown
ruby
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
a
slight
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
that
lasts
till
the
end
of
the
beer
the
aroma
consists
of
maple
raisin
brown
sugar
and
caramel
taste
starts
off
with
strong
notes
of
alcohol
brown
sugar
and
caramel
that
leads
to
a
light
toffee
taste
and
even
lighter
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
beer
also
finishes
less
boozy
than
it
starts
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
quite
carbonated
with
a
slight
burn
to
it
this
is
definately
a
sipper
and
might
need
some
time
to
age
to
become
more
drinkable
pours
a
dark
golden
brown
head
is
a
slight
off
white
with
good
lacing
smell
offers
hints
of
vanilla
maple
and
just
a
tad
of
smokiness
flavor
is
pretty
complex
sweet
up
front
maple
flavor
is
very
dominate
to
start
spiciness
of
the
oak
and
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
finish
smokey
flavor
is
there
but
very
faint
i
really
liked
this
beer
all
the
flavors
balance
each
other
nicely
very
smooth
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
pretty
harsh
mix
of
alchohol
oak
forrest
with
bits
of
vanilla
and
cardboard
tree
bark
soil
dark
fruit
and
big
abv
taste
are
the
main
drive
of
this
beers
flavor
theres
a
minute
hint
on
vanilla
but
its
overwhelmed
by
the
smoky
campfire
taste
cant
say
i
care
for
it
first
dogfish
i
didnt
like
mouth
feel
thick
body
with
light
carbonation
compliments
the
taste
perfectly
looks
like
a
belgian
trip
or
quad
really
has
a
nice
ruby
ready
color
to
it
a
huge
head
but
has
a
decent
about
of
carbonation
taste
is
very
strong
the
alcohol
content
really
slaps
you
in
the
face
then
again
as
you
swallow
ive
had
beers
with
higher
abv
but
none
that
hit
me
like
this
one
does
taste
is
very
similar
to
a
whiskey
in
flavor
like
an
earthy
taste
very
interesting
brew
overall
just
a
note
i
chilled
this
beer
then
let
it
sit
a
half
hour
before
opening
to
allow
it
to
warm
a
tad
overall
another
great
beer
in
dogfish
heads
impressive
lineup
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
is
a
definite
sipper
and
if
you
treat
it
that
way
it
will
be
kind
d
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
really
like
how
the
oak
flavors
come
out
in
this
beer
however
the
alcohol
is
very
present
and
i
dont
think
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
12
oz
bottle
aroma
nice
big
malt
characteristic
vanilla
oak
somewhat
of
a
yeast
aroma
and
a
bit
of
hops
appearance
is
a
clear
brownishamber
with
a
full
tan
head
that
lingers
taste
is
hot
got
a
decent
alcohol
bite
to
it
then
the
vanilla
and
oak
the
malt
characteristics
linger
on
through
the
aftertaste
overall
i
just
got
this
new
so
its
a
bit
hot
will
age
two
of
them
cheers
d
due
to
the
alcohol
content
i
would
watch
myself
carefully
if
i
were
to
have
more
than
one
but
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
i
could
definitely
down
a
couple
of
these
with
no
problems
d
great
beer
chock
up
another
great
beer
for
dogfish
head
overall
impression
this
ones
a
sipper
this
beer
has
spent
over
a
year
in
the
bottle
and
it
still
needs
to
cool
down
the
cloying
qualities
are
a
bit
overwhelming
this
would
be
better
served
in
56
oz
servings
good
beer
for
a
very
cold
night
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
a
beer
of
its
type
though
this
is
certainly
a
sipping
beer
one
is
enough
though
drinkability
is
moderate
alcohol
level
is
high
and
flavors
are
strong
but
palatable
nice
job
guys
d
a
very
good
beer
incredibly
smooth
and
balanced
not
exactly
my
style
but
very
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
very
god
offering
from
dfh
the
strong
naked
oak
flavor
keeps
it
from
being
great
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
burnt
wood
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
woody
smoky
with
raisin
and
cherry
qualities
alcohol
is
front
and
center
oak
flavor
is
very
strong
enough
so
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
smoke
ale
a
full
bodied
intense
beer
i
enjoyed
it
okay
but
think
its
too
complex
and
high
in
alcohol
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
md
full
bodied
syrupy
slick
low
carbonation
nice
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
high
abv
will
catch
up
to
you
eventually
though
great
beer
not
bad
has
a
smoky
taste
to
it
smells
like
a
belgian
sort
of
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
really
a
nice
smooth
bitter
sweet
malt
flavor
going
over
my
tongue
as
i
sip
at
it
then
after
several
swigs
it
gets
a
spicy
taste
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
warming
in
a
way
it
is
alot
like
the
rasin
de
estra
only
sweeter
for
a
strong
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
good
job
as
usual
dogfish
head
d
good
beer
alcohol
content
and
price
affects
its
overall
drinkability
but
definately
worth
a
try
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
like
the
general
complexity
and
that
great
maltiness
d
well
this
is
certainly
an
after
in
this
case
it
is
before
though
haha
dinner
beer
complex
warming
and
enjoyable
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
but
sipping
it
and
letting
it
warm
as
new
flavors
and
aromas
emerge
is
enjoyable
recommended
despite
the
required
for
a
4
pack
11
are
we
sure
maybe
thats
why
its
been
growing
on
me
so
it
really
doesnt
taste
or
feel
at
all
alcoholic
like
i
would
expect
after
reading
others
reviews
i
must
conclude
that
either
my
senses
are
dull
or
i
found
a
mightily
mellow
4pack
this
stuff
is
fairly
light
still
i
would
treat
it
as
a
sipper
i
had
one
last
week
after
another
possibly
stronger
beer
and
poor
immort
felt
like
a
cheap
used
belgian
dark
ale
that
to
me
is
proof
that
this
brew
is
subtle
and
delicate
and
is
something
to
be
enjoyed
carefully
with
a
squeaky
clean
pallet
and
head
kudos
this
is
a
heavy
duty
extreme
very
good
craft
brew
however
its
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
maybe
after
dinner
sitting
in
a
real
comfortable
chair
with
a
nice
piece
of
chocolate
some
classical
music
on
the
stereo
dim
lighting
in
january
with
a
snowstorm
going
on
outside
or
maybe
not
very
well
crafted
brew
from
dfh
this
is
an
awesome
american
strong
d
pretty
good
considering
this
beer
is
11
alcohol
pours
dark
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
of
vanilla
dark
fruits
and
smoke
flavor
has
some
complexity
starting
of
sweet
with
a
combination
of
vanilla
and
fruit
with
smoke
coming
through
in
the
middle
descending
into
an
alcohol
finish
with
some
bitterness
theres
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
pours
a
vibrant
amber
cherry
oak
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
that
stacks
up
a
good
inch
thick
disk
on
the
beer
the
head
leaves
sheets
of
lace
across
the
walls
of
the
glass
smell
is
maple
carmel
hints
of
raspberry
a
bit
of
oak
taste
begins
with
some
smoke
quickly
touches
some
sweet
vanilla
brown
sugar
that
when
mixed
with
the
smoke
give
the
element
of
barbque
some
oaked
raspberry
sweetness
and
tartness
touches
the
end
of
the
pallet
this
oaky
sweettart
gives
me
memories
of
a
tame
jolly
pumpkin
la
roja
finish
that
being
a
bitter
sweet
dry
finish
oh
yeah
that
alcohol
it
sure
is
hidden
if
i
was
blind
tasting
i
would
peg
this
at
7
abv
seriously
smooth
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
extremely
creamy
bitter
and
smoothly
carbonated
this
one
is
most
certainly
a
sipper
and
a
very
nice
one
at
that
has
a
sticky
dryness
about
it
on
the
end
that
hurts
the
otherwise
solid
mouthfeel
a
bit
the
sweetness
grows
to
cloying
level
after
a
while
but
this
is
an
undeniably
interesting
and
complex
brew
d
overall
a
big
beer
thats
a
tad
bit
overly
sweet
for
my
taste
drinkability
is
therefore
limited
to
a
one
and
done
due
to
alcohol
and
sweetness
taste
was
full
and
sweet
maple
and
vanilla
are
upfront
in
the
taste
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
flavors
are
also
present
a
little
time
might
do
this
one
some
good
id
be
curious
to
see
how
itd
taste
after
a
year
or
two
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
was
a
clear
ruby
color
with
a
weak
tan
head
the
nose
has
some
dark
fruits
caramel
candy
and
strong
alcohol
the
taste
has
a
cloying
sweetness
with
again
the
harsh
alcohol
the
balance
is
way
off
on
this
one
i
am
reminded
of
my
experience
with
old
school
barleywine
not
good
a
medium
body
would
go
down
nicely
if
this
tasted
better
i
drank
one
bottle
and
returned
the
rest
of
my
4
pack
smell
is
sweet
notes
of
faint
vanilla
and
slight
woodiness
maple
makes
its
presence
known
on
palate
and
maple
and
very
light
oak
fill
mouth
very
nice
texture
and
bubbles
really
play
great
in
this
brew
as
brew
warms
maple
become
more
active
really
a
good
brew
worth
the
wait
all
in
all
its
not
terrible
but
its
not
my
favorite
worth
a
try
because
it
is
quite
intruiging
but
i
will
look
elsewhere
in
the
future
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
as
its
flavors
are
close
to
over
the
top
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
overall
not
a
bad
effort
you
get
a
little
bit
of
oak
as
it
stays
with
you
pours
a
hazy
medium
to
dark
amber
color
with
a
solid
half
inch
of
off
white
head
with
decent
sustain
aroma
is
signature
high
gravity
dfh
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
and
fruity
estery
alcohol
notes
the
belgian
yeast
character
is
quite
predominant
in
the
aroma
with
its
dark
fruit
notes
masking
whats
left
though
my
cold
im
sure
is
problematic
here
on
the
palate
is
where
this
beer
really
opens
up
the
smokey
peat
is
the
first
thing
and
last
that
really
hits
me
its
at
my
threshold
for
cloying
the
juniper
is
really
not
too
strong
while
the
vanilla
and
oak
provide
the
background
this
is
a
complex
beer
and
what
they
likely
spent
a
lot
of
time
developing
but
im
not
sure
it
really
is
to
my
liking
im
glad
the
finish
is
cloyingly
sweet
though
its
actually
quite
nice
along
with
a
smooth
low
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
another
chapter
to
close
in
my
tryings
of
dfh
and
another
one
ill
likely
not
revisit
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
with
a
splash
of
belgian
strong
dark
in
it
complex
a
pretty
good
brew
from
dogfish
though
definitely
not
for
everyone
drinkability
is
ok
here
but
the
high
abv
makes
you
just
want
one
or
two
bottles
d
very
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
very
nice
all
around
i
actually
love
this
beer
d
a
strongly
flavored
and
very
different
beer
that
may
be
hit
or
miss
for
many
palates
alcohol
becomes
a
factor
when
drinking
an
entire
bottle
worth
trying
to
experience
something
different
especially
since
its
not
quite
as
costly
as
some
of
the
other
dogfish
singles
drinkability
very
good
beer
the

could
hold
you
back
but
nothing
else
i
had
a
12
oz
and
wished
i
had
a
bomber
at
least
highly
recommended
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
although
the
intense
sweetness
might
slow
me
down
fairly
quickly
its
also
not
as
complex
as
a
lot
of
other
dfh
brews
still
a
nice
one
curious
how
it
would
do
after
some
aging
o
good
sipper
for
a
nightcap
a
bit
too
sweet
and
too
much
abv
for
more
than
one
d
at
11
abv
this
one
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
very
off
centered
odd
but
different
enough
to
be
good
not
something
you
find
everyday
kudos
to
dfh
for
bucking
the
system
and
putting
out
a
fine
beer
i
bought
a
couple
of
these

i

see

poured
a

with
a

the

has
a

feel

drinkability
is
ok
for
a
beer
this
big
but
it
definately
wouldnt
be
a

and
beer
beer
this
is
a
sipping
dessert
beer
cinnamon
vanilla
and
oak
are
all
blended
into
the
smell
it
comes
out
very
well
the
taste
starts
with
spice
and
malt
and
oak
carries
through
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
sharp
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
is
apparent
immort
ale
makes
for
a
fine
nightcap
the
strength
and
complexity
makes
this
a
sipper
i
do
not
believe
that
i
could
quaff
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
tasty
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
opportunity
i
would
say
try
it
if
you
havent
had
it
before
its
worth
a
tasting
personally
im
going
to
wait
on
trying
this
again
until
next
year
so
i
can
compare
the
07
batch
to
an
aged
05
batch
and
see
if
it
works
for
me
bottled
on
040506
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
offwhite
lace
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
oakey
wood
and
vanilla
flavors
woody
flavors
dominate
the
sweet
taste
much
like
the
aroma
overall
this
is
another
creative
brew
from
dfh
that
is
worth
the
try
because
of
the
creativity
it
is
really
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
had
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
cold
rainey
night
in
the
beginning
immort
ale
veers
close
to
its
epic
goal
dark
succulence
only
to
flatten
in
the
mouth
and
slither
sickly
sweet
after
a
promising
opening
glissando
it
sweeters
out
it
arrives
like
adam
but
exits
like
candyman
in
a
lowrent
smoking
jacket
the
beer
pours
copper
with
some
reddishruby
tints
not
much
of
a
head
with
this
beer
but
what
little
head
it
did
have
went
away
quickly
it
smells
like
vanilla
maple
and
malt
this
is
a
sweet
tasting
beer
with
it
tasting
like
vanilla
maple
oak
caramel
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
its
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
even
with
the
high
abv
its
still
pretty
drinkablesippable
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
but
overall
its
pretty
good
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
bad
beer
from
dogfish
head
mouthfeel
is
good
though
slightly
drying
light
carbonation
a
very
interesting
beer
its
really
not
for
me
but
id
recommend
trying
it
just
because
its
so
unique
i
think
ill
try
aging
a
bottle
and
see
what
its
like
after
a
year
or
two
i
kept
this
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
and
the
abrasive
hops
went
away
since
if
i
had
rated
that
it
would
have
been
much
worse
cheers
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
oak
and
smoke
flavors
and
aromas
are
strong
this
was
a
pretty
fresh
beer
so
perhaps
it
could
benefit
from
aging
like
i
stated
above
the
feel
is
thick
and
heavy
its
active
and
rather
lively
but
still
feels
dense
and
thick
the
most
amazing
thing
about
this
beer
experience
is
that
after
my
first
12
oz
i
noticed
my
lips
were
actually
sticky
from
this
brew
the
11
abv
and
heavy
feel
limit
this
one
from
a
really
good
drinkability
score
this
is
a
big
rich
brew
with
complex
flavors
and
is
quite
drinkable
if
the
sweetness
were
a
bit
subdued
i
woud
have
scored
this
much
higher
across
the
board
i
still
enjoy
it
very
much
but
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
cloying
and
distracts
from
the
overall
experience
nice
medium
chestnut
colordecent
level
of
carbonation
nice
oakey
and
vanilla
aroma
going
on
not
real
prominant
but
a
nice
presence
big
malty
flavor
with
a
smokiness
i
liken
to
a
dirty
ashtray
trace
of
vanilla
with
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
the
smokiness
is
just
too
way
out
there
for
me
body
is
oknothing
real
specialthe
off
flavors
sort
of
detracts
the
whole
picture
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
and
i
love
the
big
beers
compared
to
most
other
dfh
beers
this
is
a
huge
dissapointment
had
it
years
ago
when
it
first
came
out
and
dont
remember
muchthis
might
be
why
it
is
pretty
drinkable
imo
and
is
definately
worth
a
try
this
would
age
great
drinkability
too
boozy
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
i
did
like
that
oaky
finish
if
you
dig
the
tire
rubber
or
bandaid
flavor
in
scotch
youll
dig
this
one
for
sure
mdlight
carbonation
syrupy
smooth
on
the
heavy
side
of
a
medium
bodied
beer
alcohol
not
to
noticeable
for
such
a
big
beer
an
interesting
brew
red
amber
not
much
head
heavy
oak
and
prune
and
alcohol
odor
very
strong
massive
and
weird
flavor
not
much

anything

ive
had
hickory
maple

oak
and
vanilla
lots
of
fruitiness
too
alcohol
right
up
front
and
sticky
on
the
back
end
not
easy
to
drink
but
a
good
sipper
definitely
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
hickory
smokiness
is
what
sticks
with
me
as
well
as
the
syrupiness
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
a
special
occasion
after
dinner
drink
not
as
over
the
top
sweet
as
120
min
or
wws
which
makes
it
easier
to
handle
a
very
intense
smoky
sweet
treat
i
like
it
but
one
will
do
not
very
drinkable
at
all
ive
had
8oz
and
i
dont
know
what
the
fate
of
the
other
4
will
be
still
a
beer
everyone
should
try
my
first
beer
since
being
back
in
the
states
pours
a
copperish
red
color
with
little
to
no
head
only
a
barely
traceable
white
laceing
that
is
tough
to
spot
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
complex
with
traces
of
honeymolasses
raisins
something
curious
as
well
that
seems
to
numb
the
nose
slightly
taste
was
of
milk
and
honey
some
tropical
fruit
characters
and
a
noticeable
medicinal
taste
the
latter
taste
does
not
dominate
so
much
as
it
seems
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
other
flavors
deserving
more
merit
nice
solid
mouthfeel
with
this
beer
mediumheavy
bodied
just
where
i
like
it
for
such
a
style
certainly
a
beer
to
try
maybe
not
on
a
regular
basis
but
still
very
tasty
and
interesting
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
to
smokey
very
malt
and
rich
go
good
with
bbq
almost
need
a
new
category
for
this
beer
like
smoked
barleywine
or
some
such
heading
dogfish
head
continues
to
rack
up
creativity
points
but
this
one
is
a
little
pricey
to
buy
more
than
this
single
very
interesting
if
i
was
more
of
a
fan
of
rauchbier
i
would
undoubtably
love
this
beer
but
im
not
i
can
handle
smoked
porter
but
the
smoked
malt
in
lighter
styles
adds
too
much
of
a
smoked
ham
and
sulfur
flavor
that
renders
the
beer
undrinkable
to
my
palate
d
quite
interesting
makes
you
want
to
sip
and
ponder
again
and
again
for
the
record
my
score
is
for
the
recent
immort
not
the
aged
one
overall
impression
this
one
is
lost
on
me
the
smoke
and
wood
are
too
oppressive
it
tastes
overattenuated
to
me
as
well
i
admire
dfh
for
melding
the
high
abvs
in
their
big
brews
unfortunately
this
one
is
hidden
under
a
cloud
of
smoke
worth
a
try
i
suppose
wont
revisit
this
one
i
recommend
you
at
least
taste
this
beer
but
just
for
the
experience
and
make
your
own
opinions
as
its
obvious
from
the
reviews
below
some
people
like
it
okay
not
me
but
who
am
i
but
on
sole
ba
on
this
planet
d
this
beer
is
complex
and
creative
i
just
dont
care
for
the
taste
i
have
tasted
infected
beers
that
have
a
bandaid
taste
but
it
wasnt
the
same
bandaid
taste
as
this
beer
this
was
more
cloth
breathable
than
plastic
i
thought
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
when
i
had
it
at
the
barrel
aged
beer
festival
when
it
called
imoak
ale
but
the
wood
flavors
were
much
nicer
and
the
malt
was
a
bit
different
overall
i
dont
know
what
to
expect
anymore
from
the
category
strong
ale
with
a
slight
underlying
creaminess

this
is

not

though
considering
its

is
just

the

is
a

that
is
balanced
by

this
is
a
very
excellent
beer
this
beer
had
a
sweet
mouthfeel
had
hints
of
maple
throught
and
actually
finished
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
strong
vanilaa
flavor
that
lingered
on
i
tried
this
beer
years
ago
with
a
novice
palette
and
thought
it
tasted
as
if
alcohol
was
added
after
brewing
this
brew
actually
turned
me
off
to
dogfish
but
i
have
since
gladly
returned
to
thier
great
experimental
style
well
hundreds
of
brews
later
i
decided
to
give
this
brew
another
shot
here
goes
appearance
is
typical
of
a
high
abv
brew
no
head
really
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
a
deep
golden
colored
brew
that
looks
thick
the
smell
is
instantly
alcoholic
with
a
sweet
malt
in
the
background
somewhat
expected
at
11
very
sweet
taste
with
a
lingering
bitter
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
kick
is
still
there
in
a
major
way
did
they
add
vodka
to
this
brew
the
alcohol
seems
separate
from
the
beer
here
other
brews
at
higher
abv
are
much
more
drinkable
even
other
dogfish
head
brews
olde
school
comes
to
mind
and
i
really
cant
taste
much
past
the
vodka
bite
and
sweet
maltiness
perhaps
a
bit
of
vanilla
cake
in
there
maybe
like
they
say
go
with
your
first
instinct
a
big
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
i
love
big
beers
but
this
one
whiffed
comments
for
me
this
beer
was
very
different
and
enjoyable
would
like
to
have
it
again
just
to
try
and
unlock
the
mysteries
of
those
spices
yeehaw
this
is
such
a
potent
brew
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
away
very
fast
there
was
virtually
no
lace
left
aroma
is
very
sweet
scents
of
maple
syrup
plums
vanilla
and
smoked
wood
entice
the
olfactory
senses
surprisingly
there
is
barely
any
smell
from
the
11
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
complex
as
is
the
aroma
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
of
hops
followed
by
a
sweet
taste
of
brown
sugar
and
dried
fruit
but
wheres
the
alcohol
i
still
cant
taste
it
then
i
stood
uptheres
the
alcohol
it
creeps
up
on
you
like
a
tiger
hunting
down
its
prey
and
then
whammo
this
is
a
great
and
complex
brew
just
dont
have
too
much
or
the
abv
will
kick
you
in
the
arse
it
is
crisp
and
tingly
with
a
great
full
body
and
intense
flavors
it
is
very
drinkable
but
i
would
imagine
some
people
would
differ
in
opinion
on
that
subject
since
we
are
beer
drinkers
with
opinions
drinkable
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
packing
11

not
evident
in

this

mainly
because
both
it
and
i
are
from

for

this
is

quite
a

i
truly
loved
every

of
it
my
bottles
are

i
cant

to
see
what
theyre
like
after
a
little
cellaring
notes
a
barley
wine
of
no
other
so
extreme
and
complex
this
could
easily
use
another
year
or
two
to
mellow
out
though
it
is
fine
to
sip
in
the
brash
form
that
it
is
in
now
outstanding
pours
a
very
dark

almost
brown
decent
head

but
it
didnt
stay
all
that
well
faded
down
to
a
thin
lace
smells
of
vanilla
smokiness
alcohol
and
a
very
light
maple
the
first
sensations
to
hit
my
tongue
are
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
at
the
same
time
a
light
smoke
character
throughout
the
taste
traces
of
vanilla
and
alcohol
for
the
strength
of
this
brew
you
dont
really
taste
the
alcohol
all
that
strongly
very
drinkable
for
its
potency
i
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
of
this
brew
and
lay
it
down

11
sipping
brew
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
barley
winestyle
ale
overall
pretty
good
this
is
up
there
with
the
great
barleywines
sweet
and
tangy
yet
not
overpowering
a
lot
like
victorys
old
horizontal
mediocre
barleywines
are
out
there
everywhere
and
immort
ale
is
way
above
that
category
whoa
holy
poop
what
a
helluva
beer
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
cant
compare
it
to
anything
in
recent
memory
its
a
one
of
a
kind
distinctive
beer
you
must
try
before
you
die
a
treasure
of
the
brewers
art
as
an
aside
check
this
out
after
discovering
this
new
arrival
at
the
local
liquor
store
a
few
years
back
i
bought
the
sixpack
up
to
the
counter
where
the
clerk
couldnt
find
a
price
on
it
and
honestly
i
had
no
idea
how
much
it
was
later
to
find
it
was
13
bucks
asked
where
i
found
it
i
replied
in
the
warm
beer
aisle
overall
this
beer
isnt
completely
to
my
taste
theres
lots
of
bread
and
biscuit
and
not
much
of
the
fruitiness
i
often
enjoy
in
the
style
there
is
a
what
is
this
moment
for
a
couple
of
gulps
but
then
it
turns
into
a
different
but
very
pleasant
brew
hoppy
and
warm
with

and
hazelnut
lovely
quite
lovely
great
palate
to
this
onelow
carbonation
and
smooth
finish
a
very
good
english
esb
really
better
than
any
i
have
tasted
from
american
brewer
the
body
was
nicely
full
and
smooth
although
there
was
just
a
bit
of
stickiness
on
the
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
this
big
beer
went
down
easily
and
there
may
be
another
in
my
future
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
certainly
worth
your
time
if
you
see
it
and
very
close
to
being
a
must
try
smells
mostly
of
the
expected
english
style
earthytoffeebready
malt
blend
with
a
small
side
serving
of
chocolate
and
pitted
fruits
the
flavor
is
more
dry
leafy
and
nutty
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
and
it
has
hardly
any
of
the
fruitiness
from
the
nose
at
all
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
a
fairly
nice
beer
but
not
really
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
acquire

not

poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
an
average
off
white
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
very
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
aroma
is
super
mild
with
only
a
hint
of

and
hop
flavors
like

carbonic

up

followed
by

not
a

going

body
and
carbonation
are
good
finish
is
like
flavor
average
length
and
forgettable
while
the
beer
is
still
very
drinkable
im
not
sure
how
much
a
person
will
be
able
to
drink
in
one
sitting
give
it
a
go
if
youre
curious
but
dont
expect
to
have
the
most
frabjous
day
on
account
of
this
ale
overall
an
ok
beer
which
is
my
first
from
this
brewery
i
am
not
that
impressed
with
this
beer
but
it
is
not
bad
by
any
means
i
will
look
out
for
more
beers
from
this
brewery
body
is
fairly
rich
and
creamy
a
nice
example
of
an
englishstyle
pub
ale
amped
up
to
american
standards
the
high
abv
limits
how
much
i
would
want
to
consume
in
an
evening
but
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
the
husky
bitterness
is
a
little
troubling
but
overall
this
is
a
wellexcecuted
ale
this
englishstyle
old
ale
begins
with
a
faint
darkmalt
aroma
not
roasted
as
such
but
melanoid
it
is
glazed
mahogany
with
low
suds
and
a
light
sugarplum
taste
though
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
comes
across
as
indistinct
and
lacking
any
formative
identity
the
flavors
are
too
understated
to
evoke
sustained
enthusiasm
pretty
tasty
and
interesting
beer
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
appreciate
how
well
made
this
one
is
taste
is
very
smooth
and
somewhat
mild
for
a
strong
ale
pleasant
malt
and
orchard
tastes
low
carbonation
and
nice
body
make
for
a
very
drinkable
ale
surely
this
is
a
winter
delight
this
beer
has
its
act
together
beautiful
colour
substantial
lingering
head
sweet
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
hard
candy
this
really
is
like
fruitcake
in
a
glass
caramel
malt
dark
bread
cherry
and
plum
are
all
prominent
in
the
flavour
profile
i
love
the
overall
packaging
and
complexity
of
this
beer
once
again
fullers
shows
exactly
how
to
craft
a
multi
layered
substantial
ale
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
with
a
great
interplay
of
flavors
ranging
from
the
spicy
hop
finish
to
the
toasted
malt
and
fruity
esters
from
the
yeast
hands
down
a
great
even
amazing
beer
in
my
books
and
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
very
good
beer
which
has
a
few
notes
that
are
a
bit
off
the
earthy
tastes
dont
blend
well
would
prefer
a
sweeter
aftertaste
more
like
the
more
prominent
flavors
rather
than
the
bitterness
i
pickup
a
bit
less
carbonation
would
be
nice
as
well
good
beer
poured
an
almost
muddy
tan
to
start
with
but
then
cleared
a
little
and
was
more
of
a
caramel
nice
fluffy
head
that
dissipated
slowly
and
then
left
a
very
nice
lacing
that
stuck
around
as
i
drank
the
beer
outstanding
looking
beer
i
dare
say
beautiful
the
smell
is
not
overly
strong
there
appears
to
be
some
caramel
with
the
malt
smell
and
there
seems
to
be
some
dark
fruit
of
some
sort
taste
is
outstanding
but
not
overly
complex
an
easy
and
very
smooth
drinking
strong
ale
but
lacks
wow
more
of
a
lighter
version
of
strong
ales
the
feel
is
also
kinda
light
not
real
creamy
or
thick
it
also
leaves
you
kinda
dry
which
is
weird
overall
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
have
anytime
dont
remember
the
cost
as
to
whether
it
was
a
good
value
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
know
this
is
a
uality
ale
if
fullers
cant
do
it
whocan
ive
had
this
in
my
beer
inbox
for
quite
a
while
poured
a
brown
caramel
colour
with
a
light
brown
small
head
aromas
of
caramel
tastes
of
caramel
roasted
nut
slight
spice
there
is
lacings
left
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
more
you
drink
which
is
fairly
quickly
because
im
really
enjoying
this
the
beer
pours
a
nice
tannish
and
creamy
head
that
dissipates
moderately
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
orangish
brown
the
beer
smell
has
strong
bread
notes
and
nice
toasted
malt
notes
as
well
as
a
light
and
bitter
hop
note
that
is
concealed
under
the
other
notes
the
beer
taste
is
phenomenal
the
bitter
hop
notes
are
stronger
than
in
the
smell
and
works
very
well
to
balance
out
the
same
toasted
notes
present
in
the
smell
however
the
malted
notes
are
a
bit
weaker
and
not
as
diverse
the
malt
notes
have
a
slight
caramel
note
and
a
lightly
toasted
bread
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
very
light
carbonation
despite
the
vigorous
head
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
nice
to
sit
down
with
after
a
tough
day
at
work
beautiful
looking
beer
with
a
nice
malty
smell
and
taste
smooth
all
the
way
down
this
ones
a
keeper
the
beer
is
unusually
clear
for
a
bottle
conditioning
oddly
it
says
on
the
label
its
bottle
conditioned
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
or
the
glass

i
could
and
would
drink
this
one
all
night
in
a
pub
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
pours
a
dark
brown
body
there
is
a
sweet
malt
characteristic
in
the
taste
and
flavor
this
beer
also
has
a
tingle
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
the
jaw
as
it
goes
down
nice
dark
redbrown
color
with
good
offwhite
head
aroma
of
caramel
and
hops
taste
is
bitter
with
sweetness
in
finish
long
bitter
aftertaste
good
beer
awesome
a
classic
from
one
of
the
all
time
great
breweries
hard
to
find
so
make
sure
to
pick
one
up
if
you
see
it
overall
a
really
well
balanced
beer
with
solid
malt
profile
that
finishes
dry
enough
that
you
can
several
pints
of
it
really
good
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
92
overall
as
with
many
of
these
beers
its
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
very
pleasant
beer
this
is
a
very
fine
ale
very
well
crafted
and
bold
on
flavors
with
good
complexity
above
my
initial
expectations
a
must
for
malt
lovers
its
a
fullers
kind
of
evening
and
this
one
finally
emerges
from
my
cellar
poured
into
an
old
school
english
pint
glass
this
venerable
and
potent
ale
is
a
reddish
amber
hue
with
a
nice
solid
tan
head
that
reminds
one
of
lightercolored
sponge
toffee
my
wife
wondered
what
was
wrong
with
it
haha
aroma
is
expectedly
rich
and
malty
with
some
spicy
esters
and
tangy
goldings
hops
combining
to
evoke
rich
fruitcake
and
dried
apricots
palate
is
correspondingly
rich
and
complex
with
a
gorgeous
honeyed
malt
flavor
and
a
rather
light
body
does
coat
the
mouth
and
the
earthy
woody
finish
lingers
for
quite
a
while
some
shortbread
sponge
toffee
treacle
and
tree
nuts
pecans
provide
the
sweet
dark
backdrop
but
there
is
also
a
bright
almost
sour
fruitiness
like
cranberries
and
even
a
whiff
of
smoke
the
alcohol
is
wellconcealed
but
it
does
peek
through
to
add
yet
another
layer
of
complexity
certainly
reminds
one
of
its
big
brother
fullers
vintage
albeit
brighter
fruitier
and
maybe
less
multifactorial
still
why
compare
this
one
stands
on
its
own
considerable
merits
o
flavors
ive
come
to
expect
from
fullers
though
this
one
has
a
bit
more
intriguing
complexity
compared
to
some
of
their
vintage
ales
ive
tried
their
aged
beersbottles
can
be
a
bit
of
a
crap
shoot
with
quality
and
stability
but
when
theyre
on
theyre
often
some
of
the
finest
ales
around
and
certainly
some
of
my
favorites
of
those
uk
brews
more
readily
available
over
here
overall
despite
the
growth
of
cask
conditioned
ales
available
here
in
the
colonies
very
few
i
can
count
them
on
one
hand
duplicate
the
smell
body
and
flavor
of
the
great
real
ales
of
england
this
beer
allows
those
of
you
who
have
not
made
the
trip
to
england
to
better
understand
what
the
rest
of
us
are
talking
about
1845
is
not
an
exact
duplicate
of
those
handpumped
ales
it
doesnt
possess
the
silky
smooth
carbonation
of
a
real
ale
but
the
flavors
are
all
there
what
a
treat
caramel
and
toffee
notes
followed
by
a
mix
of
cooked
fruits
jam
and
raisin
take
a
hold
of
your
nose
and
invite
you
to
take
a
sip
of
this
exemplary
version
of
an
english
strong
ale
all
of
the
notes
present
in
the
aroma
are
revisited
in
the
flavor
the
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
are
only
enhanced
by
the
fantastic
almost
creamlike
mouth
feel
the
light
toffee
and
dried
fruits
esters
linger
into
the
after
palate
followed
by
the
mild
bitterness
of
the
english
hops
used
o
an
excellent
strong
ale
everything
you
want
for
this
style
very
nice
a
sterling
effort
from
fullers
and
a
modern
classic
it
looks
lovely
with
a
creamy
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
well
balanced
with
fruity
malt
dominating
the
proceedings
and
a
satisfying
touch
of
alcohol
great
body
smooth
and
mildly
viscous
not
one
to
down
in
a
hurry
but
a
pleasant
sipper
that
suits
the
autumn
weather
definitely
worth
your
time
if
you
come
across
it
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
lentil
soup
and
crusty
whole
grain
bread
rjt
o
an
awfully
good
brew
even
if
it
is
tasting
quite
different
on
a
second
pint
a
couple
days
separated
from
the
first
both
have
english
brown
ale
notes
and
both
are
good
malt
bombs
even
if
my
palette
is
accepting
it
more
as
a
darker
more
oldalelike
brew
than
the
bit
lighter
brown
ale
fine
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
and
again

overall
this
is
a

excellent

strong

big
complexity

balance
of
robust

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
slightly
improves
with
warming
despite
the
emergence
of
clear
alcohol
tones
in
the
aroma
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
thought
it
had
a
wellbalanced
consistency
not
too
thick
or
thin
the
taste
was
wonderful
however
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
refreshing
warmweather
beer
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
it
on
a
crisp
autumn
evening
i
tend
to
equate
beer
styles
with
the
seasons
and
this
is
a
fullbodied
and
fullflavored
brew
best
enjoyed
in
cooler
weather
i
noted
a
boozy
but
clean
finish
overall
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
ale
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
in
the
future
o
great
beer
to
start
the
new
year
with
o
nothing
complex
but
absolutely
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
a
good
example
of
a
british
and
definitely
worth
your
time
a
perfect
example
of
style
however
not
worth
a
premium
price
over
the
standard
english
import
a
very
welldone
big
ale
malt
character
dominates
throughout
with
hops
and
alcohol
presence
comingling
in
a
wellbalanced
fashion
rich
complex
warm
and
inviting
wonderful
beer
highly
recommended
hope
to
try
this
one
fresher
but
even
after
a
trip
cross
pond
this
beer
fucking
rocks
d
drinkable
to
the
extreme
i
wish
i
knew
a
bar
closeby
that
had
this
on
draft
as
i
would
be
a
frequent
repeat
customer
there
i
am
definitely
buying
this
again
its
like
a
cross
between
an
english
bitter
and
an
english
barleywine
lots
of
malt
flavor
with
really
good
balance
if
you
must
have
lots
of
hops
in
your
beer
then
avoid
this
if
you
like
malty
beers
like
bocks
and
english
barleywines
and
old
ales
then
by
all
means
pick
this
one
up
it
is
delightful
o
fuller
smith
turner
are
not
going
to
make
mistakes
these
people
have
been
brewing
on
site
for
over
300
years
this
is
a
classy
beer
makes
me
think
working
mans
beer
as
in
something
you
quaff
in
a
pub
after
a
day
of
labor
that
brings
as
much
toughness
and
heart
to
the
brew
as
you
do
to
the
work
day
quality
craftsmanship
poured
from
bottle
into

reddish
brown
with
a
finger

smell
is
sweet
malty
with
some
fruity
esters
taste
is
sweet
malty
but
very
tart
and
somewhat
fruity
its
tasty
dry
and
slightly
sour
its
a
solid
beer
but
its
a
slight
miss
for
me
overall
i
like
this
one
all
of
fullers
are
very
good
just
not
so
high
in
the
abv
this
one
is
a
tad
higher
at
6
3
which
is
a
blast
more
than
the
flagship
fullers
at
4
9
or
whatever
it
is
this
is
a
really
good
beer
good
for
a
few
in
a
row
and
not
too
gaggingly
sweet
but
it
is
sweet
creamy

sweet

creamy

semidry
aftertaste
smooth

topside
this
has
an
easy
good
loose
magnolia
head
which
sends
up
subtle
waves
of
toffee
orange
copper
brown
appearance
in
the
mouth
and
to
taste
there
is
an
unfolding
complexity
of
some
castrol
sugary
sweetness
back
and
forth
ending
firmly
with
a
dry
dark
gentle
bitterness
a
bit
raw
but
juicy
too
and
firm
and
that
roastiness
doesnt
quite
lead
into
anything
too
stern
doesnt
at
all
appeal
to
my
emotions
but
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
just
shy
of
sessionable
but
that
is
because
of
the
higher
abv
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
overall
great
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
without
blinking
you
get
everything
you
could

i
am
going
to
explore
more
of
the

o
a
truly

english
ale
between
the
taste
and
the
name
its
definitely
not
hard
to
imagine
sipping
some
of
this
in
a
pub
at
room
temperature
in
some
bygone
age
currently
my
favorite
english
beer
ill
be
buying
again
looking
over
my
bottle
this
is
way
past
best
before
date
by
5
months
and
its
still
dang
impressive
even
still
this
beer
is
delivering
will
be
trying
this
again
for
sure
o
possibly
my
new
favourite
beer
o
this
really
is
remarkable
the
beer
fresh
was
awesome
but
this
is
breath
taking
its
easy
drinking
smooth
flavourful
and
overall
just
excellent
overall
fullers
brews
never
disappoint
they
are
good
solid
beers
i
imagine
that
they
represent
what
beer
was
like
back
in
the
day
so
not
to
sound
corny
but
it
s
like
a
brief
view
into
the
history
of
english
brewing
the
fact
that
they
are
so
well
received
in
current
times
says
it
all
a
nice
beer
with
good
color
and
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
flat
without
a
lot
of
head
and
what
head
there
was
dissipated
quickly
caramel
notes
as
well
as
some
fruit
and
herbal
notes
not
a
lot
of
hop
a
bit
alcoholic
but
not
excessive
considering
this
beer
is
6
3
abv
o
mediocre
i
dont
get
what
everyones
raving
over
a
nice
soft
powerful
real
ale
this
was
o
another
very
high
quality
product
from
fullers
a
few
have
mentioned
the
alcohol
but
the
duel
cocoahop
bitterness
keeps
this
in
check
in
my
opinion
the
drinkability
is
very
high
and
id
love
to
enjoy
this
on
tap
at
a
pub
any
time
another
delightful
ale
from
the
uk
and
i
highly
recommend
this
one
an
enjoyable
beer
though
it
did
seem
subdued
at
times
o
a
truly
excellent
and
classic
beer
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
beer
that
is
a
must
drink
for
anybody
exploring
the
world
of
beer
truly
a
classic
and
truly
worth
the
acclaim
this
beer
pours
out
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
english
with
dark
fruits
toffee
caramel
honey
chocolate
and
some
spicing
very
complex
yet
distinctly
english
the
taste
is
good
with
a
complex
banquet
of
slightly
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
chocolate
spices
toffee
and
cream
that
comes
just
as
fast
as
it
goes
leaving
just
the
slightest
hint
of
roast
fruit
and
creaminess
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
prickly
for
the
style
at
first
but
is
strongly
drying
overall
its
a
very
good
english
ale
thats
a
bit
more
aggressive
than
i
expected
its
strong
flavors
make
it
a
good
beer
for
the
steadfast
american
craft
drinker
to
aquatint
themselves
with
some
english
flavor
o
wow
hard
to
find
big
fresh
aggressive
british
ales
and
this
is
one
of
them
im
going
to
wipe
the
store
out
of
them
o
a
great
aged
beer
still
some
nice
elements
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
certainly
overaged
overall
a
nice
ale
but
would
be
better
if
its
strength
was
covered
up
more
o
nice
beer
well
balanced
nice
comfort
beer
overall
nice
bigger
beer
that
doesnt
demand
a
lot
of
attention
good
casual
drinker
lav
a
ley
overall
if
you
like
english
malt
this
is
a
must
try
excellent
flavor
and
well
balanced
overall
this
beer
is
strong
but
creamy
and
smooth
as
well
has
some
excellent
features
and
well
balanced
the
strength
and
booziness
makes
this
seem
similar
to
a
port
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
overall
a
classic
that
i
finally
took
the
time
to
review
and
one
that
i
would
visit
again
anytime
i
dont
think
it
is
the
best
english
strong
ale
in
the
worlddespite
being
rated
so
but
definately
top
5
overall
this
strong
ale
is
anything
but
this
has
wonderful
flavors
and
is
easy
to
drink
do
yourself
a
favor
and
have
this
ale
o
i
love
this
beer
the
balance
of
flavors
is
great
leaning
a
little
bit
towards
the
sweeter
side
fantasticcomplex
and
awesome
english
ale
from
fullers
though
i
would
expect
no
less
incredible
malt
and
yeast
profile
simply
splendid
o
a
lot
of
flavour
in
this
smooth
english
strong
ale
prickly
carbonation
with
a
mediumfull
body
a
touch
of
stickiness
very
rounded
and
smooth
really
excels
in
this
department
an
extremely
wellmade
beer
that
has
an
understated
alchol
punch
deceptively
strong
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
smooth
and
rich
a
substantial
but
not
heavy
beer
with
great
depth
complexity
and
integration
o
just
ok
but
not
something
i
will
buy
again
sorry
fullers
this
one
is
a
miss
for
me
notes
this
may
not
be
as
complex
or
as
winey
as
yorkshire
stingo
but
it
is
so
toe
curlingly
yummy
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
o
body
aside
this
is
pretty
nice
the
person
who
sold
it
to
me
described
this
as
barleywine
light
and
i
think
thats
a
solid
read
this
is
a
nice
nightcap
beer
for
people
with
responsibilities
the
next

it

level

a
session
beer
that
said
i
could
have
a
couple
more
poured
a
500ml
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
dishwater
brown
color
with
a
surprisingly
large
beige
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
down
the
entirety
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
far
more
citrus
then
i
would
have
expected
while
i
have
had
this
beer
before
this
is
the
first
time
i
remember
getting
this
much
lemon
out
of
the
nose
toffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
also
come
through
the
taste
is
bready
off
the
bat
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
the
tail
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
astringent
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
lemon
sent

which
throws
off
the
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
if
it
werent

the
astringency
in
the

of
the

this
beer
would
have
received

enjoy

more

they
sit
out

about
30
min
i
think
the

brew
to
try
im
usually
not
too
keen
on
true
english
beers
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
wasnt
too
dry
hoppy
or
malty
it
had
all
the
right
levels
for
each
and
every
one
of
them
i
would
probably
go
back
to
this
one
again
if
i
was
ever
in
the
mood
for
an
english
strong
ale
great
strong
ale
very
well
done
i
havent
had
one
in
a
year
or
so
with
a
visit
to
great
britain
in
between
this
one
is
a
fine
fine
example
of
a
common
british
ale
complex
tasty
brew
will
definitely
be
having
more
high
quality
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
full
flavored
ale
with
good
concentration
and
a
solid
profile
another
great
brew
from
fullers
cheers
this
is
a
very
tasty
well
balanced
beer
i
had
some
on
cask
at
nerax
and
soon
picked
up
a
bottle
for
myself
i
tried
this
beer
on
november
2
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
generous
tan
coloured
head
which
dissipated
into
little
foam
islands
on
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
malty
with
some
hints
of
fruit
tones
and
cloves
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
little
carbonation
and
some
bitterness
the
flavour
is
mainly
malty
a
little
licorice
and
a
little
bitterness
the
beer
is
little
heavy
but
feels
magnificent
and
tastes
delicious
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
meal
in
a
bottle
but
i
doubt
i
would
have
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
d
a
nice
well
rounded
ale
not
something
to
drink
everyday
but
every
now
and
then
would
be
good
im
always
pleased
with
fullers
offerings
and
this
is
no
different
definitely
recommended
the
taste
on
the
sweet
side
but
nicely
balanced
with
a
hoppy
bite
has
elements
of
caramel
fruit
very
floral
hops
with
a
bite
light
citrus
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
spice
that
lingers
faintly
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
wonderfully
rich
and
complex
while
being
incredibly
balanced
drinkable
and
smooth
mfd
creamy
and
delicious
this
is
a
exceptional
ale
highly
recommended
d
a
solid
english
strong
ale
but
i
feel
like
for
me
this
is
consistent
with
a
fullers
beer
and
many
others
from
england
i
e
it
is
solid
but
fails
to
wow
the
drinker
defiantly
one
i
will
be
seeking
again
if
i
had
another
id
drink
it
right
now
the
only
downside
came
when
i
attempted
a
second
this
beer
is
a
meal
in
a
glass
it
was
rich
and
full
bodied
and
beatiful
while
it
lasted
similar
to
a
steak
dinner
however
i
found
the
second
one
very
hard
going
and
i
had
to
move
onto
desert
a
lovely
beer
but
not
one
that
you
will
stay
on
all
night
taste
sweet
but
still
very
clean
it
became
mellower
as
it
warmed
the
light
carbonation
and
the
creamy
head
gave
it
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
pours
maroon
and
clear
with
a
medium
sized
lasting
beige
head
smell
is
biscuity
slightly
tart
malt
taste
is
surprisingly
hoppy
compared
to
the
nose
with
dark
bready
and
caramel
malt
flavor
to
accompany
the
hops
slightly
full
bodied
and
crisp
yet
soft
carbonation
pretty
balanced
and
drinkable
with
a
nice
mild
hop
character
pleasantly
surprised
this
beer
acts
bigger
than
it
really
is
id
love
to
drink
it
all
night
ive
had
to
restrain
myself
from
drinking
at
the
pace
i
wanted
to
in
order
to
finish
my
review
as
you
can
see
by
the
scores
i
think
this
is
great
stuff
and
ill
certainly
buy
again
rather
limited
availability
is
a
bit
of
a
downer
though
definitely
worth
seeking
out
for
those
who
havent
tried
it
yet
the
beer
keeps
some
lacing
and
has
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
ale
and
i
think
fullers
pulls
it
off
better
than
most
d
a
very
interesting
and
not
common
style
i
could
drink
this
regularly
carbonation
is
a
little
high
body
is
medium
finish
is
dry
and
encourages
the
next
sip
drinkable
but
kinda
bland
poured
from
16
9oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
darkish
brownred
color
fat
head
that
could
be
my
bad
pouring
skills
but
i
dont
think
so
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
very
similar
with
a
bit
of
roasted
flavor
added
in
aftertaste
has
some
bitterness
and
fruit
perhaps
prunes
medium
thick
mouthfeel
seems
pretty
drinkable
and
somewhat
complex
but
i
prefer
other
fullers
beers
i
later
noticed
the
best
if
consumed
by
july
19
2005
on
the
label
needless
to
say
i
am
not
going
back
to
the
place
that
sold
me
this
threeyearold
beer
it
would
be
interesting
to
edit
this
review
with
a
fresher
beer
very
tasty
and
ive
only
enjoyed
this
brew
34
times
before
i
will
certainly
pick
up
again
very
nice
overall
a
good
sample
but
certainly
not
above
and
beyond
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
particular
fan
of
english
brews
d
very
nice
and
drinkable
this
is
an
interesting
tasting
strong
ale
full
rich
flavors
but
not
too
overpowering
i
would
recommend
that
you
try
this
if
you
get
the
chance
i
would
consider
this
one
of
the
better
strong
ales
that
ive
had
but
still
not
my
favorite
good
for
sure
not
a
session
beer
but
very
good
and
interesting
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
nice
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
was
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
entire
evening
verdict
certainly
my
favorite
out
of
the
three
fullers
beers
ive
had
ill
probably
buy
another
bottle
to
age
because
its
bottle
conditioned
very
drinkable
i
would
buy
it
again
whoa
what
a
taste
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
far
different
than
this
but
am
glad
i
was
surprised
the
malt
sweetness
hits
the
palate
with
the
intensity
of
a
freight
train
and
then
is
reduced
to
rubble
by
the
slow
bite
of
the
hops
a
fine
ale
indeed
for
those
brits
drinkability
this
is
a
very
classy
wellmade
beer
strong
yet
balanced
and
contained
a
unequivocal
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
delicious
again
enormous
thick
chewy
resilient
malt
burnt
caramel
flavors
with
bigger
toffee
backing
a
very
minute
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
mollasses
almost
turning
to
brown
sugar
gooey
date
and
prune
with
some
black
figs
thrown
in
big
mouthfeel
with
a
long
long
finish
a
easy
drinking
delicous
english
brew
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
nice
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
film
atop
the
beer
aroma
was
nice
maltiness
that
implied
fruit
caramel
and
spices
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
has
a
nice
dry
fruity
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
extremely
high
left
nice
lacing
around
glass
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
ive
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
as
long
as
i
could
which
is
not
as
long
as
i
should
cracked
open
to
savour
while
blowing
heads
off
zombies
on
the
wii
ahh
shes
a
beaut
a
russet
coloured
body
with
a
thinnish
white
head
the
smell
is
delectable
and
packed
full
of
all
manner
of
dark
sensuous
fruits
and
there
it
is
in
the
flavour
figs
dates
raisins
abound
against
a
malty
backbone
cut
through
with
a
medium
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
an
excellent
quality
beer
but
the
zombies
keep
coming
fullers
always
manages
to
please
this
one
is
no
exception
dark
amberbrown
with
a
tan
head
that
held
well
and
left
pretty
nice
lace
nose
is
caramelly
burnt
toffee
some
pale
malt
a
little
dried
fruit
and
orangy
marmaladish
hop
scent
taste
was
pretty
much
what
the
nose
suggested
with
a
touch
of
a
bite
at
the
finish
medium
full
and
mighty
pleasurable
d
quite
complex
as
im
sure
im
missing
out
on
the
finer
points
of
this
beer
but
the
mellow
aspect
of
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
beers
that
focus
on
one
aspect
of
taste
this
a
very
drinkable
and
at
the
same
time
a
beer
that
demands
your
full
attention
as
you
drink
it
chestnut
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
caramel
treacle
toffee
and
earthy
hops
the
flavors
are
similar
with
a
juicy
chewy
caramel
malt
ridden
by
the
noticeable
bittering
hops
i
detect
a
slight
metallic
flavor
that
is
not
unwelcome
as
it
warms
there
is
more
nutty
toffee
flavors
and
some
livestock
farm
smells
almost
a
washedrind
cheese
aroma
maybe
that
would
be
a
good
match

i
did
not
want
to
delete
this
and
review
again
but
i
did
want
to
add
that
i
have
determined
i
like
this
beer
more
when
it
is
served
at
about
60
degrees
in
a
snifter
than
out
of
the
fridge
in
a
pint
glass
it
is
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
fullers
vintage
ale
but
it
is
an
excellent
old
ale
creamy
nutty
milk
chocolate
good
bitter
balance
one
of
my
new
stand
by
beers
so
i
do
not
go
through
ones
i
really
want
to
age
d
another
good
beer
from
fullers
not
as
drinkable
and
tasty
as
their
regular
esb
in
my
opinion
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
a
nice
slightly
strong
beer
for
all
occasions
finish
is
dry
and
long
hoppy
overall
a
tasty
and
deep
ale
almost
like
a
honed
and
more
drinkable
version
of
the
golden
pride
designed
for
session
rather
than
one
off
drinks
like
a
cask
beer
let
this
one
warm
to
cellar
temperature
tastes
of
toasted
bread
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
spices
wood
fruits
and
a
hoppy
zing
i
can
only
imagine
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
have
this
ale
on
cask
the
fullers
name
continues
to
impress
me
with
this
ale
and
i
found
the
drinkability
to
be
very
much
to
my
liking
highly
recommended
to
all
especially
lovers
of
english
ales
pours
a
deep
garnet
with
a
decent
head
that
sticks
around
awhile
and
leaves
some
respectable
lacing
a
beautiful
looking
beer
especially
in
the
light
the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
gentle
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
also
somewhat
gentle
as
well
as
being
bready
with
a
nice
subtle
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
nicely
integrated
and
much
more
subtle
than
an
american
strong
but
beautifully
executed
for
what
it
is
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
integrated
flavors
and
a
reasonable
abv
make
this
quite
drinkable
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
that
sustains
well
nose
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
malts
fruits
and
hops
first
taste
was
slight
alcohol
warming
a
malty
treat
with
hints
of
apple
balanced
nicely
by
a
dry
woody
hop
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
a
very
impressive
brewery
this
has
a
lovely
rich
dark
amber
body
the
head
was
foamy
and
tan
and
had
some
staying
power
a
very
smooth
ale
with
lots
of
malty
goodness
and
strong
hop
aftertaste
i
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
to
having
had
some
so
so
brews
from
fullers
before
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
a
wonderful
brew
that
certainly
deserves
its
rating
strongly
recommended
pours
a
clear
red
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
half
inch
head
smell
is
mild
but
is
sweet
and
estery
taste
is
sweet
slightly
fruity
and
a
little
estery
too
somewhat
complex
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
being
very
malty
but
has
a
extremely
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
wonderfully
beer
but
some
might
miss
the
complex
taste
being
distracted
by
the
high
amount
of
hops
in
this
one
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
great
on
cask
overall
i
love
it
its
a
very
complex
and
well
balanced
beer
fullers
never
fails
this
is
a
very
nice
strong
british
bitter
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
plenty
of
head
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
muted
but
what
you
do
get
is
fruity
esters
candy
like
aroma
toasted
malts
and
a
barley
wine
style
syrupy
sweetness
the
smell
is
more
subtle
than
pronounced
and
i
believe
it
creeps
out
more
as
the
beer
settles
and
warms
the
taste
is
quite
dry
and
bitter
with
hints
of
chocolate
bready
malts
tart
datesraisins
and
lots
of
background
hops
the
tartness
and
bitterness
is
not
your
typical
burnt
caramel
variety
and
for
that
i
am
very
pleased
this
is
more
your
medium
bodied
slightly
carbonated
dry
creamy
dark
chocolate
variety
of
bitterness
and
it
is
very
pleasant
the
aftertaste
is
quite
noticeable
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
the
beer
does
not
have
even
that
warming
alcohol
note
to
it
because
it
doesnt
have
to
i
was
surprised
at
the
6
3
abv
thinking
it
was
quite
a
bit
lower
this
is
a
very
good
british
strong
ale
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
such
and
have
an
appreciation
for
the
style
lchaim
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
somewhat
cloudy
due
to
being
unfiltered
smells
earthy
you
first
taste
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
then
a
tiny
bit
of
diacytal
then
a
toasty
flavor
with
a
nice
bitterness
to
match
carbonation
is
a
little
high
for
the
style
but
if
you
let
it
sit
out
for
awhile
it
gets
to
authentic
british
levels
its
a
shame
that
fullers
doesnt
bottle
condition
all
their
beers
like
this
as
the
yeast
adds
a
great
flavor
simply
fantastic
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
have
to
grab
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
one
before
its
gone
d
very
drinkable
for
its
weight
nicely
balanced
an
enjoyable
beer
d
my
first
taste
of
this
fine
ale
definitely
not
the
last
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
at
the
same
time
i
found
the
alcohol
backdrop
interfered
and
where
i
expected
bitterness
at
the
finish
i
got
a
bit
of
sour
tartness
i
cant
help
but
think
that
a
bit
of
aging
and
maturation
are
all
thats
needed
to
turn
all
my
scores
to
4
5
this
was
just
released
at
the
lcbo
and
im
going
to
pick
up
and
cellar
a
few
to
open
in
consecutive
years
i
see
this
improving
with
age
and
scoring
much
higher
although
having
one
right
now
is
quite
alright
too
more
than
recommended
essential
d
this
is
a
big
big
beer
not
in
any
was
sessionable
but
massive
assault
on
the
tastebuds
good
all
around
solid
strong
ale
ive
had
some
that
a
more
assertive
taste
but
if
fullers
1845
lacks
at
all
in
flavor
it
makes
up
for
it
in
drinkability
the
nice
orangy
brown
body
is
topped
with
a
lovely
but
not
too
long
lasting
foamy
head
the
scent
is
minimal
and
probably
its
weakest
point
good
mix
of
hops
bittering
and
flavorful
maltiness
the
flavor
bounces
from
a
sweet
honey
taste
to
a
burnt
smokiness
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
pasty
on
the
tongue
leaving
a
cotton
mouth
but
other
than
that
it
goes
down
just
fine
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
dense
tan
head
that
left
a
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
figsplums
burnt
toastcharcoal
woody
the
taste
is
of
fig
a
hint
of
dark
cherry
carob
roasted
malt
with
slight
espresso
notes
the
feel
is
well
bodied
has
a
creamy
texture
to
it
finishes
quite
bitter
which
lingers
a
bit
too
long
good
flavor
range
and
aroma
a
very
nicely
built
beer
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
liking
but
that
wont
stop
me
from
trying
again
purchased
at
city
super
in
shatian

huge
amount

same
can
be
said
for
the
flavor
vinuous
and
boozy
at
first

improving
as
it
warms
to
a
quite
nice

ale
bitterness
is
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
is

wellcarbonated
drinkability
is
aided
by
the
justright
alcohol
content
soul
i
dig
it
a
very
nice
english
strong
ale
with
a
lot
of
character
enjoy
neat
stuff
happened
wow
period
nice
english
strong
ale
decent
head
and
retention
and
a
strong
malty
smell
taste
is
very
balanced
between
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
mild
biterness
and
slight
alcohol
backbone
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
crisp
and
doesnt
leave
enough
of
an
aftertaste
however
this
is
one
strongale
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
definetly
worth
a
try
overall
impression
plenty
of
interesting
flavors
this
one
got
even
better
as
it
warmed
up
d
overall
this
beer
was
enjoyable
but
i
wasnt
really
sure
of
what
to
expect
not
bad
but
not
overly
impressive
either
still
a
solid
option
provided
by
fullers
and
i
think
this
would
suit
certain
occasions
better
than
others
this
is
fullers
flagship
ale
though
im
sure
some
advocates
will
make
a
case
for
their
esb
or
london
porter
go
ahead
and
try
them
all
and
judge
for
yourself
i
cant
recall
if
ive
ever
had
an
english
strong
ale
but
if
this
beer
sets
the
bar
for
them
then
i
will
be
inclined
to
pick
up
some
others
fullers
does
it
again
with
another
nicely
balanced
and
full
flavored
beer
overall
decent
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
notes
there
was
just
something
a
little
unbalanced
with
this
one
definitely
let
this
warm
up
significantly
maybe
ill
give
it
another
try
sometime
bit
of
a
bitter
beginning
but
smooth
on
the
palate
tiny
alcohol
burn
with
a
coffeelike
dry
finish
nice
caramel
aftertaste
quite
nice
d
divine
example
of
an
old
ale
bottle
conditioning
means
this
ones
alive
and
experiences
may
vary
but
this
one
certainly
should
be
revisited
with
frequency
id
like
more
of
this
but
its
pretty
expensive
and
hard
to
find
in
my
area
though
nice
in
some
respects
this
beer
has
much
too
strong
a
flavor
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
the
bitterness
seems
unbalanced
and
excessive
as
well
ill
pass
next
time
around
my
notes
reveal
that
by
the
third
sip
it
reminded
me
of
an
exceptional
cask
conditioned
ale
superb
aroma
of
caramel
nice
head
retention
and
sticky
lacing
another
reviewer
said
fish
n
chips
would
work
well
with
it
and
i
agree
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
decent
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
smells
perhaps
of
apricots
and
caramel
taste
hints
of
toasted
rye
malt
peat
grapefruit
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
very
full
bodied
not
overly
carbonated
as
it
is
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
this
is
quite
good
makes
me
want
some
fish
and
chips
i
would
like
to
have
one
more
to
settle
a
few
issues
but
all
in
all
a
good
beer
overall
great
strong
english
ale
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
yet
again
fullers
impress
you
want
this
stuff
very
fine
ale
this
is
a
great
beer
that
does
not
dissapoint
complex
and
tasty
this
one
is
definitely
for
the
malt
lovers

the

my
god
the
head
on
this
thing
is
out
of
control
ive
been
pouring
a
bit
here
and
there
over
the
past
few
minutes
but
the
head
just
continues
to
grow
ive
now
got
what
looks
from
afar
like
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
floating
on
top
of
a
red
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
is
good
or
bad
but
it
looks
pretty
cool
aromas
are
very
subtle
with
honeydew
kiwi
pressed

and
a

floral
not
what
i
expected
for

nice

honeyed

dull

a

some

int

aftertaste
quite
a

understated
beer
nothing
id
crave
very
regularly
but
a
wholly
unique
experience
nonetheless
recommended
at
least
once
drinkability
for
drinkability
its
probably
the
best
strang
ale
around
its
neither
as
complex
nor
as
heavy
as
most
of
the
better
ones
which
is
a
2edged
sword
for
someone
just
getting
into
stong
ale
this
is
probably
the
one
i
would
stear
them
towards
a
flavorful
bigger
english
ale
but
tastes
slightly
oxidized
although
6
months
prior
to
best
before
date
some
nice
old
ale
type
complexity
might
do
better
to
let
it
warm
more
completely
degas
a
bit
and
sip
it
slowly
i
would
gladly
recommend
this
to
any
ale
enthusiast
without
reservation
if
i
come
across
this
in
a
pub
you
can
bet
i
will
buy
at
least
2
pints
if
not
then
for
a
full
night
of
drinking
though
some
may
find
this
to
be
slightly
heavy
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
make
for
a
very
good
session
d
excellent
drinkability
i
really
like
this
one
alot
d
extremely
drinkable
give
me
anutha
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
first
ive
had
of
the
style
so
i
have
no
other
beer
to
compare
it
to
but
it
has
a
great
flavor
i
love
how
this
beer
can
manage
to
be
fruity
and
malty
without
being
sweet
even
more
remarkably
it
manages
this
feat
without
showing
any
overt
hoppiness

im
dissappointed
in
the
alcohol

after
all

the

beer
from
this
brewery
that
ive
had
yet
vintage
ale
is
still
to
come
and
is
easily
the
best
version
of
the
english
strong
ale
style
that
ive
ever
had
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
side
to
side
it
simply
oozes
quality
i
dont
see
it
often
but
when
i
do
ill
be
sure
to
stock
up
highly
recommended

is
good
and

says

served

the

color
with
a
decent
sized
frothy
offwhite
head
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
that
stays
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
raisins
nuts
caramel
and
toffee
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
but
theres
also
a
slight
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
slightly
slick
and
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
somewhere

this
beer

samuel
smithsomewhat
the
head
lasted
to

the

side
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
very
enjoyable
i
bought
this
on
the
recommendation
of
a
beer
store
clerk
who
said
this
was
the
beer
he
went
for
when
he
just
felt
like
having
a
beer
i
totally
know
what
he
is
talking
about
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
the
smell
is
overloaded
with
malts
and
little
else
the
taste
is
much
the
same
little
carbonation
as
its
a
real
ale
and
not
a
notice
of
hops
just
straight
dark
and
moderate
malts
there
is
a
bit
of
burntness
too
it
but
i
imagine
this
is
one
of
the
malts
just
a
good
basic
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
definitely
something
to
try
d
this
is
not
one
to
pound
rather
savor
one
bottle
over
the
course
of
a
night
fairly
potent
yet
highly
drinkable
a
remarkably
crafted
english
brew
great
flavor
and
well
balanced
a
strong
ale
from
england
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
i
highly
recommend
and
look
forward
to
having
another
one
soon

taste
it
four

after
the

before

while
i
was
pleased
with
this
ale
i
thought
the
bitterness
at
end
might
limit
it
to
a
one
or
two
rounds
in
the
scope
of
a
normal
american
bar
setting
the
long
term
drinking
of
this
ale
would
be
enhanced
by
finding
this
on
draft
good
stuff
d
tasty
brew
which
is
definitely
worth
trying
its
quite
fine
though
timid
for
a
strong
ale
yea
its
very
malty
yea
its
very
bold
and
firm
yea
its
very
complex
and
varying
but
it
just
lacks
strength
power
and
maturity
looks
a
very
deep
amber
copper
color
with
a
fresh
carbonation
that
is
over
compensated
for
its
style
taste
however
is
boldly
malty
balanced
with
earthy
hops
and
heavy
on
the
bredy
yeastiness
age
should
bring
a

maltiness
smooothness
rich
and
heavy
characters
that
are
now
masked
with
youth
will
improve
with
a
year
of
cellering
but
now
a
bit
too
young
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
soft
orange
brown
and
yellow
hues
at
the
bottom
of
my
mug
a
big
head
developed
quickly
and
just
seemed
to
sit
there
stable
and
creamy
heavy
lacing
left
behind
as
well
aromas
of
alcohol
pepper
hops
and
dried
fruit
the
taste
was
milder
than
the
nose
indicated
with
a
smoked
malt
sweetness
contrasting
nicely
with
the
hops
fruit
flavors
added
nice
depth
and
blended
very
well
with
the
peppery
spice
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
smooth
crisp
and
slighly
bitter
finish
an
excellent
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeeldrinkability
heavy
in
the
mouth
there
is
not
much
carbonation
to
support
the
density
of
the
beer
with
the
hops
as
prevalent
as
they
are
especially
in
the
middle
and
finish
it
could
use
some
effervescence
to
keep
things
alive
the
alcohol
is
especially
noticable
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
which
keeps
this
tasting
moving
at
a
slow
pace
overall
a
very
nice
bottle
conditioned
ale
to
cap
off
the
night
altogether
a
unique
and
delicious
find
wellworth
trying
for
fans
of
either
british
ales
or
belgian
dubbels
i
find
it
has
some
of
the
best
characteristics
of
both
drinkability
eminently
drinkable
personally
i
consider
a
smooth
english
bitter
to
be
the
benchmark
of
drinkability
and
fullers
knows
something
about
that
although
its
a
strong
ale
the
balance
is
considerable
theres
no
unpleasant
flavors
no
excessive
yeastiness
and
no
overcarbonation
to
create
any
of
the
unpleasant
tanginess
that
can
creep
in
bottleconfditioned
beers
the
higher
alcohol
content
had
no
impact
on
this
beers
drinkability
the
best
bottleconditioned
english
ale
i
ever
had
hazy
with
unusual
and
very
pleasant
aroma
extremely
wellbalanced
leaving
a
delcate
aftertaste
and
a
solid
reason
for
another
bottle
or
two
fruits
nuts
and
malts
lots
of
them
all
still
leave
a
place
for
hoppy
accent
which
is
most
welcome
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
a
must
for
all
alelovers
overall
a
nice
beer
good
one
to
sip
on
after
a
nice
steak
dinner
but
it
isnt
one
i
would
stock
up
on
drinkability
at
around
4
a
bottle
this
stuff
isnt
cheap
but
yes
its
damn
good
and
despite
the
4s
i
gave
it
throughout
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
unfortunately
too
fast
for
the
price
especially
due
to
the
fairly
low
abv
at
least
for
my
taste
these
english
strong
ales
are
an
odd
sort
as
hard
to
drink
as
11
00
abv
beers
only
half
as
strong

pours
to
an

and
somewhat

mostly

strong
slightly

very
good

very

really

like
to
find
on

somewhere
dark
fruit
flavors
raisin
prune
with
some
orange
and

in
the
finish
slàinte
overall
a
very
good
beer
recommended
overall
a
tasty
ale
highly
recommended
if
you
want
an
alternative
to
american
hop
bombs
as
this
one
lets
the
malt
shine
through
a
well
constructed
brew
and
one
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
nice
full
tan
head
reddishamber
color
pretty
beer
the
aroma
has
some
hints
of
tobacco
and
licorice
some
very
slight
esters
its
interesting
but
not
as
appealing
as
some
others
ive
had
the
flavor
is
good
big
and
bold
and
not
subtle
at
all
it
doesnt
have
the
delicate
malthop
blend
you
get
out
of
american
pale
ales
and
ipas
yes
i
mean
delicate
in
the
sense
that
you
get
a
soft
maltiness
under
the
hops
the
maltiness
in
this
one
is
more
caramelly
burnt
toffeelike
and
the
hops
are
not
floral
they
are
more
aggressive
than
that
but
i
find
that
appealing
this
is
a
british
pale
ale
after
all
i
think
its
really
good
and
id
like
to
have
several
of
these
although
its
a
nice
strong
beer
the
scent
of
malt
hit
me
right
after
i
open
the
bottle
very
powerfull
and
full
smell
was
of
malt
sweet
and
carmel
like
also
some
butterscotch
like
scents
mixed
in
with
the
floral
and
somewhat
herbal
like
smells
from
the
hops
so
much
to
smell
taste
much
like
the
scent
very
powerfull
sweet
and
malty
hints
of
carmel
and
floral
like
in
the
aftertaste
nice
bittering
to
offset
the
initial
sweetness
a
very
well
balanced
beer
imo
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
mouthfeel
was
perfect
not
to
much
carbonation
and
not
to
smooth
just
right
awesome
beer
taste
very
malty
good
malty
i
like
the
taste
of
this
ber
lots
of
sweet
malts
and
light
hops
very
balanced
the
beer
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
beige
head
that
laces
well
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
malt
but
does
have
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruit
in
the
background
the
taste
has
a
strong
malt
that
is
nicely
bittered
and
i
find
just
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
hiding
back
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
heavy
and
oily
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
in
the
end
and
a
dry
finish
while
i
tend
to
lean
towards
maltier
and
sweeter
beers
this
is
a
bitter
that
could
tempt
me
the
hops
has
been
used
to
make
the
beer
nicely
bitter
the
feel
is
pleasant
and
makes
for
a
beer
you
could
find
yourself
drinking
all
evening
this
is
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
the
color
is
a
nice
brown
there
was
a
medium
sized
head
the
smell
is
of
molasses
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
and
the
molasses
show
up
here
too
there
is
also
a
caramel
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lot
smoother
that
i
was
expecting
there
is
no
harshness
at
all
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
was
a
bit
timid
at
first
now
i
wish
i
had
another
bomber
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
lately
d
awesome
tasty
brew
well
balanced
very
affordable
a
great
and
versatile
brew
to
just
have
hanging
in
the
fridge
drinkability
pretty
decent
all
this
and
more
in
a
bottle
of
fullers
1845
app
a
big
frothyyeasty
head
body
of
a
nice
brown
ale
sm
great

cedar
saw
dust
and
cinnamon
ta
dry
cedar
again
eggy
cinnamon
and
spice
mf
low
carbonation
otherwise
smooth
sailing
da
drinkable
enough
but
the
dryness
gangs
up
and
takes
away
from
the
overall
effect
probably
best
as
a
nightcap
first
time
trying
this
and
im
very
impressed
appearance
is
lovely
head
and
lacing
are
beautiful
as
a
bottle
conditioned
brew
should
be
scent
is
nutty
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
tastes
very
appropriate
for
the
smell
nutty
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
delicious
brew
a
nearly
perfect
example
of
the
style
could
be
a
touch
more
complex
but
it
goes
down
so
easily
that
i
really
cant
complain
this
was
not
what
i
expected
at
all
and
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
need
to
take
another
look
at
a
few
other
offerings
from
fullers
to
date
ive
only
had
this
and
their
esb
both
were
very
good
and
i
imagine
they
have
much
more
to
offer
as
well
best
by
date
of
20mar06
somewhat
of
a
hoppy
characteristic
but
of
the
grassy
type
light
malt
and
i
thought
pepper
and
allspice
rather
than
the
nutmeg
from
the
desciption
frothy
lightbrown
head
that
completely
vanished
the
taste
was
right
on
style
i
can
imagine
having
this
on
cask
in
a
good
local
yum
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
as
this
is
classified
as
an
english
strong
ale
one
would
think
that
cellaring
this
would
be
good
i
dont
think
the
chracteristics
would
really
lend
themselves
to
get
any
better
with
age
i
have
another
bottle
i
bought
in
2004
that
ill
have
to
rate
soon
aroma
is
very
hard
to
detect
very
faint
cola
notes
is
all
i
pick
up
light
brown
with
a
firm
finger
thick
head
i
get
the
fruit
cake
notes
mentioned
in
the
commercial
descrip
and
in
fact
this
is
very
bready
mild
spice
in
there
as
well
the
cakebread
notes
are
extremely
long
lasting
and
start
from
the
middle
and
stay
well
into
the
aftertaste
i
like
beers
like
this
that
have
a
feel
good
aftertaste
that
lingers
a
long
while
adam
one
is
certaintly
enough
for
me
i
have
no
desire
for
another
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
buttery
but
the
water
is
rich
in
minerals
which
creates
a
killer
bite
when
combined
with
the
hoppiness
the
body
is
quite
full
has
a
nice
bitter
nutty
roasty
finish
very
enjoyable
i
usually
am
not
a
big
fan
of
hopped
up
by
british
standards
buttery
estery
and
mineralrich
english
ales
but
this
one
was
very
interesting
to
me
for
some
reason
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
however
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
which
can
get
to
me
at
times
well
worth
coming
back
to
time
and
time
again
i
found
this
brew
to
be
quite
distinct
and
interesting
another
winner
from
fullers
although
it
isnt
for
the
uninitiated
i
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
flavor
really
comes
into
its
own
as
it
warms
wonderful
very
nice
poured
a
nice
rich
amber
with
a
fluffy
lasting
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
rich
choc
like
godiva
choc
malts
and
a
hint
of

very
nice
flavor

a

good
beer
a
very
enjoyable
and
satisfying
ale
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
definately
enjoy
the
bottle
conditioning
a
great
ale
for
my
100th
review
this
beer
is
like
a
brain
and
body
massage
mellow
and
fulfilling
and
wholesome
i
need
to
get
this
off
a
british
tap
drinkability
a
tad
heavy
to
be
something
id
call
highly
drinkable
one
bottle
will
be
about
enough
for
the
evening
bottle
obtained
from
lquor
malt
boulder
for
0

because
the
best
before
date
had
just
passed
by
pours
a
1
5
finger
dark
tan
head
over
a
cloudy
dark
amber
liquid
smells
richly
of
caramel
toffee
and
chocolate
has
that
notable
smell
i
find
only
in
fullers
products
tastes
like
a
fullers
product
too
soured
caramel
some
coffee
and
a
toffeechocolate
dry
cocoa
and
a
grassy
edge
some
rough
alcohol
burn
and
fusel
taste
enjoyable
and
one
i
might
pick
up
again
since
its
only
99
cents
md
body
and
modest
carbonation
good
effort
worthy
of
fullers
tradition
of
excellence
the
color
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
its
rich
deep
caramel
very
inviting
but
the
nose
is
too
too
grainy
when
i
first
nosed
this
beer
the
thing
that
came
to
mind
was
dog
kibble
and
not
in
a
good
way
flavorwise
the
mix
of
brown
ale
and
bitter
ale
flavors
in
the
fullers
1845
just
dont
work
for
me
the
grainy
flavor
carrying
over
from
the
nose
ruins
the
bitter
hop
flavor
and
the
hop
flavor
doesnt
work
with
the
grain
either
way
i
look
at
this
it
seems
an
unwise
mix
of
flavors
not
recommended
good
copperred
color
but
no
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
raisins
wine
and
fresh
hops
mildly
alcoholic
has
a
complex
flavor
sweet
fruity
malt
with
a
crisp
bitterness
notes
of
cherries
grapes
nuts
and
floral
hops
present
finish
is
somewhat
dry
it
has
medium
thickness
and
is
a
little
low
on
carbonation
great
balance
of
flavors
and
not
overpowering
so
its
very
drinkable
overall
a
decent
beer
for

cheers2beers
great
drinkability
i
still
think
that
fullers
esb
is
better
but
given
sufficient
quantity
i
could
easily
session
it
all
night
long
cloudy
brown
with
orange
highlights
small
white
head
leaving
a
solid
ring
and
bigbubble
islands
large
malt
and
alcohol
nose
nutty
and
sweet
sweet
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
and
segues
into
a
ashy
hoppiness
for
the
finish
lingering
alcohol
but
not
burningly
so
fine
drinking
beer
none
of
the
flavors
dominate
so
this
can
be
a
multibottle
affair
not
too
expensive
either
toasted
malt
and
moderately
bitter
hops
combine
with
a
smooth
round
mouthfeel
that
make
the
drinking
experience
quite
pleasureable
full
of
flavor
and
posessing
an
even
balance
this
is
a
great
cold
weather
english
pub
ale
and
i
can
definitely
see
watching
six
nations
rugby
in
february
armed
with
a
few
pints
of
this
another
winner
from
the
boys
in
chiswick
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
certainly
was
left
wanting
another
although
it
was
definitely
something
to
be
sipped
on
given
the
higher
alcohol
content
besides
it
is
so
fun
to
savor
and
roll
around
on
your
tongue
that
you
wouldnt
want
to
rush
through
it
best
before

mediumfull

very
drinkable
brew
my
first
strong
english
ale
to
date
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
quite
different
in
alot
of
respects
highly
recommend
a
tasty
wellcrafted
english
ale
it
has
a
great
malt
character
that
shines
without
totally
taking
over
due
to
the
judicious
hop
additions
d
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
complex
malt
layers
but
they
are
all
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
toasting
scale
the
hops
balance
well
but
the
harshness
of
the
grain
is
overpowering
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
that
is
not
that
heavy
my
first
from
fullers
and
i
will
definately
be
trying
more
the
pour
is
a
bright
reddishbrown
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
great
retention
tons
of
sweet
yet
spicy
fruity
malt
aroma
fills
the
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
with
molasses
and
mild
fruit
and
sharp
from
the
malts
as
well
as
the
hops
this
could
be
an
imperial
esb
its
quite
complex
but
still
quaffable
opinion
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
british
style
beers
except
the
porters
and
stouts
i
normally
dont
care
for
the
bitters
as
the
water
is
too
minerally
so
you
are
left
with
a
metallic
and
harsh
aftertaste
this
beer
finishes
very
well
balanced
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
1845
is
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
large
thick
light
brown
head
the
retention
is
excellent
and
leaves
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
a
combination
of
english
malt
and
hops
is
noted
the
flavor
is
very
malty
toasty
english
malts
are
first
noted
and
are
followed
by
a
strong
fruitiness
plumlike
and
notes
of
chocolate
dry
english
hop
flavors
come
in
towards
the
finish
the
alcohol
flavor
seems
very
strong
for
something
that
is
only

overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
if
it
werent
for
a
weak
aroma
1845
would
have
fared
better
ahh
tasty
nice
bit
of
hop
on
the
finish
was
a
bit
unexpected
but
quite
welcome
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
but
not
too
slick
and
its
finished
off
nicely
by
a
mild
hop
bite
a
very
good
english
ale
that
i
will
seek
out
again
drinkability

the
beer
is
fine
but
nothing
about
it
compels
me
to
continue
after
one
this
brew
pours
a
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
creamy
and
white
the
aroma
is
malty
with
piney
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
quite
balanced
with
the
malt
being
a
little
more
pleasant
the
aftertaste
is
nice
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium

this
is

quite

taste
followed
by
caramel
and
butterscotch
flavours
malt
hit
you
first
then
followed
by
a

and

you

ends
up
with
a
bust
of

is
primarily
hops
bitterness
but
with
persistant
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
note
that
this
beer
is
not
a
strong
ale
its
a
classic
19th
century
pale
ale
i
dont
know
why
everyone
gets
so
confused
the
brewery
clearly
said
that
they
were
trying
to
recreate
a
pale
ale
from
1845
i
think
they
did
a
wonderful
job
the
bottle
over
flowed
when
i
opened
it
oh
well
whats
more
is
it
poured
with
a
weak
head
that
quickly
disipated
this
is
a
really
special
ale
i
think
its
crazy
so
many
tastes
sweet
malt
and
heavy
hops
with
wood
and
bread
i
dont
really
understand
how
those
chemicals
like
phenols
and
diacytal
and
ester
taste
but
i
think
these
are
probably
in
here
because
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
that
i
can
acount
for
that
show
up
in
just
about
every
english
ale
i
taste
the
color
is
almost
like
some
one
took
ale
and
poured
either
blood
or
transmition
fluid
in
it
definitely
complex
as
with
most
english
ales
ive
tasted
it
gets
smoother
as
it
warms
up
i
wouldnt
really
drink
alot
of
these
the
way
i
would
other
beers
oh
wait
yes
i
would
i
can
imagine
most
people
drinking
this
to
inebreation
thats
not
to
say
it
isnt
drinkable
but
when
compared
with
drinkable
beers
its
definitely
not
as
drinkable
really
pay
attention
to
the
recommended
50
degree
serving
temperature
tastes
lovely
coffee
chocolate
and
very
biscuity
which
adds
more
lovely
to
the
mouthfeel
which
is
bubbley
and
chewy
a
good
amount
of
maltyness
in
there
and
some
bitter
hops
near
the
end
a
slight
amount
of
dark
fruityness
hidden
kind
of
the
backbone
to
the
beer
i
really
liked
it
lots
going
on
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
too
a
sipper
for
sure
but
i
enjoyed
taking
my
time
with
this
one
id
do
it
again
this
is
a
must
have
in
the
stable
no
boredom
here
as
each
drink
is
a
blast
of
flavor
cheers
to
ding
what
an
amazing
beer
if
this
is
what
beer
tasted
like
in
1845

perhaps
just
the

all
of
the
richness
of
this
beer
is
well
balanced

some
nice
bittering

i
am
interested
in
cellaring
one
of
these
for
a
year
to
see
what
happens
drinkability
very
tasty
smooth
complex
and
well
balanced
even
if
its
not
perfect
i
like
this
style
more
than
the
barleywine
or
pale
ale
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
ive
always
thought
this
is
one
of
the
finest
british
imports
finally
gotten
around
to
reviewing
it
it
pours
a
dark
amberbrownish
color
with
a
not
too
thick
tan
head
the
color
goes
along
with
the
substantial
nature
of
the
beer
itself
making
it
a
good
representation
it
smells
of
malt
and
fruit
with
a
slight
caramel
aroma
to
boot
not
a
terribly
strong
smelling
beer
but
pleasant
none
the
less
tastes
bold
with
a
deep
and
malty
flavor
distinguished
by
more
than
hints
of
caramel
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
is
completed
by
a
chocolatetype
finish
very
flavorful
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
sweet
with
a
good

carbonation

this
is
a
good
and
tasty
beer
to
me
it
is
a
good
beer
to
begin
the
night
before
moving
on
to
hoppier
session
brews
one
at
a
time
is
enough
for
me
but
to
each
his
own
this
is
one
tasty
ale
and
now
that
ive
found
a
local
source
ill
certainly
have
this
in
my
regular
rotation
ive
got
something
of
a
nostalgia
for
english
pale
ales
as
bass
was
one
of
my
favorites
back
in
college
and
ive
got
a
real
appreciation
for
that
fruity
malty
experience
drinking
fullers
1845
or
fullers
london
pride
or
youngs
special
london
ale
makes
me
realize
that
there
are
much
more
complex
and
artful
expressions
of
the
english
pale
ale
holy
smoly
what
a
bourbon
brew
looks
like
an
amber

slow

brew
here
taste
boozy
and
round
with
pale
malt
character
and
a
crisp
bitterness
that
was
short
but
the
hooch
stayed
on
a
while
in
the
aftermath
very
well
balanced
and
rounded
brew
that
develops
nice
complexities
as
it
warms
a
bottle
conditioned
gem
that
i
wish
was
available
in
quebec
drinkability
easy
to
guzzle
this
stuff
and
not
even
realize
it
i
cant
say
i
would
make
it
my
session
beer
but
a
few
rounds
to
get
the
night
going
would
be
perfect
poured
witha
cream
head
and
small
bubbles
on
a
clear
deep
amber
body
rich
toffeeish
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
nutty
biscuity
flavors
smooth
well
balanced
witha
excellent
mouthfeel
sweet
malt
with
some
toasted
malt
and
a
good
solid
hop
character
in
the
taste
definetly
worth
getting
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
with
head
that
sits
pretty
small
the
nose
is
of
esters
floral
hops
and
i
know
this
might
sound
weird
but
it
also
smells
of
pennies
if
youve
ever
had
to
put
pennies
in
your
mouth
youll
know
what
i
mean
the
taste
has
some
crispness
i
pick
up
on
the
hops
and
some
citrus
and
there
is
a
slight
metalicness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
medium
carbonation
i
think
this
is
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
tastes
like
a
scaled
down
version
of
a
popular
christmas
beer
ive
had
if
youve
ever
had
it
im
sure
you
know
which
one
im
talking
about
overall
though
its
a
good
beer
i
like
it
i
cant
say
im
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
give
it
a
3
5
for
taste
because
the
style
describes
it
as
such
pours
a
reddish
brown
out
of
the
bottle
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
some
fruit
some
diacetyl
reminiscent
of
the
hsa
scent
and
some
major
earthy
hops
very
hopped
for
an
english
ale
but
it
has
that
noncitrusy
nonpiney
scent
to
it
flavour
is
big
some
caramels
and
fruit
with
a
nice
roastiness
that
gives
way
to
the
taste
of
english
water
and
the
carbonation
dissipating
on
the
tongue
and
then
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
at
the
end
that
soothe
the
tongue
instead
of
agressively
attacking
it
like
american
hops
do
some
lingering
and
faint
roastinesshoppiness
leave
the
mouth
happy
at
the
aftertaste
i
think
the
water
used
contributes
to
this
almost
metallic
mouthfeel
that
is
typical
of
english
ale
good
drinkability
though
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
eight
of
these
during
one
session
haha
pours
a
deep
amber
thats
pretty
clear
and
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
a
beautiful
english
ale
smell
is
citrusy
hops
fruity
esters
and
a
lightly
sweet
caramel
background
the
taste
has
an
agressive
hop
profile
for
an
english
ale
anyway
with
big
grapefruit
flavors
and
a
hint
of
lemon
there
is
a
lightly
sweet
malt
profile
with
hints
of
caramel
vanilla
and
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
juicy
wiith
light
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
english
ale
overall
im
a
huge
fullers
fan
london
pride
is
my
favorite
beer
but
1845
is
a
big
disappointment
just
too
much
alcohol
it
ruins
the
beer
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
ale
pours
a
lovely
deep
copper
hue
with
a
frothy
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
but
never
disappears
left
a
lot
of
lacing
in
the
the
process
of
entertaining
my
palate
aroma
is
a
subdued
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
fruit
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
maltiness
followed
by
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
a
subtle
fruitiness
thats
almost
spicy
in
nature
a
pleasant
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
nasty
rainy
day
like
today
medium
bodied
and
creamy
light
carbonation
keeps
it
in
balance
very
drinkable
and
now
my
absolute
favorite
english
strong
ale
a
truly
exceptional
and
subtle
strong
bitter
the
best
of
the
regular
fullers
lineup
in
my
opinion
though
the
london
porter
is
a
personal
favorite
as
well
the
body
is
medium
with
tickling
pinpoint
bubbles
and
a
silky
creamy
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
filled
with
floral
hops
the
best
english
ale
of
this
kind
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
laying
my
lips
across
good
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
refreshing
a
good
beer
despite
the
disgusting
goo
floating
around
in
it
not
my
kind
of
beer
but
it
must
have
been
good
cause
i
drank
it
all
in
no
time
flat
hence
the
oddness
if
you
love
hop
flavour
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
is
your
beer
this
poured
from
he
bottle
into
the
shaker
pint
glass
a
deep
copper
to
amber
with
a
decent
sized
cream
colored
head
the
head
receded
quickly
into
the
glass
and
left
a
great
sheet
of
lace
on
the
side
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
citrus
grapefruit
but
there
is
caramel
malt
there
along
with
something
a
little
tougher
to
detect
maybe
a
hint
of
cherry
the
taste
is
more
complex
definitely
caramel
toffee
some
citrusgrapefruit
and
almost
a
licorice
flavor
and
a
hint
of
brandy
on
the
finish
richer
and
fuller
than
i
expected
from
the
aroma
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
they
dont
match
up
on
style
description
but
both
have
a
similar
tastesmellappearance
profile
this
one
actually
has
a
better
appearance
of
dark
mahogany
and
amberburnt
sienna
almost
but
more
red
woody
earthy
smell
but
more
malty
than
the
aforementioned
brew
it
is
very
pleasant
and
may
actually
have
a
nicer
mouthfeel
too
but
taste
and
smellwise
i
give
the
nod
to
smutty
maybe
its
just
that
much
fresher
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
higher
abv
in
this
one
too
i
tend
to
prefer
lower
abv
beers
as
a
rule
because
if
i
like
them
i
dont
have
to
worry
about
having
too
many
of
them
as
much
as
i
do
with
a
real
high
abv
beer
wow
pours
with
a
frothy
head
which
goes
down
as
you
drink
it
beautiful
deep
amber
color
great
freakin
great
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
ripe
fruits
mostly
couldnt
pick
one
out
that
stood
out
in
my
head
though
taste
is
english
hop
driven
slightly
vinous
mouthfeel
is
good
though
a
touch
thin
for
a
strong
ale
good
classic
beer
one
of
the
few
drawbacks
was
the
fact
that
the
dryness
stays
on
your
tongue
longer
than
the
rest
of
the
drinking
experience
if
you
dont
want
to
wind
up
feeling
all
dried
up
afterwards
id
recommend
you
have
some
water
milk
or
a
wetter
beer
after
this
one
oh
my
god
heaven
in
a
bottle
i
could
drink
it
all
day
if
i
had
the
money
from
a
bomber
uk
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
actively
rising
bubbles
and
a
dense
head
of
heavy
foam
patchy
thin
lacing
left
behind
from
fluffy
dissolve
aroma
here
is
smoky
malt
some
coffee
and
maple
notes
rounded
out
with
a
slight
hoppy
smell
taste
is
bitingly
bitter
with
banana
and
coffee
paying
a
visit
to
my
mouth
cavern
chocolate
malt
and
cherry
notes
in
the
background
a
bit
too
bitter
for
the
sweet
tastes
going
on
here
a
quality
beer
but
confusing
overall
and
somewhat
unwelcomely
overpowering
rich
dried
fruits
where
purchased
a
fresh
bottle
at
whole
foods
in
arlington
va
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
head
smell
has
a
little
bit
of
the
afore
mentioned
fruits
but
the
taste
is
dry
bitter
and
finishes
like
charcoal
mixed
with
water
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
fullers
vintage
ales
and
ive
heard
that
those
are
based
upon
the
1845
maybe
im
wrong
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
was
utterly
undrinkable
to
me
the
bitter
dryness
at
the
end
made
me
yearn
for
something
to
clense
my
pallete
people
seem
to
love
this
stuff
though
so
take
this
with
a
grain
of
salt
pours
a
reddish
coppery
color
with
a
generous
white
head
that
lingers
for
quite
some
time
smells
of
nutty
caramel
malt
slight
bready
yeast
and
a
very
slight
astringency
tastes
of
smooth
malty
goodness
kind
of
like
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
along
with
biscuitlike
yeast
flavors
rounded
out
by
a
nice
smooth
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
finish
is
dry
and
clean
a
quality
english
ale
from
fullers
this
beer
got
better
and
better
as
it
warmed
but
was
not
my
pint
of
beer
at
the
start
i
think
i
just
need
a
little
more
time
away
from
beer
from
jolly
old
to
rest
my
taste
buds
and
purge
a
bad
memory
of
a
crappy
english
beer
cheerio
poured
from
the
1pt
9oz
bottle
this
beer
comes
out
as
a
clear
brownish
garnet
color
the
head
goes
down
slowly
leaving
light
lacing
a
very
small
head
remained
throughout
my
sampling
of
this
beer
the
smell
was
hoppy
with
hints
of
fruit
and
possibly
caramel
the
taste
was
excellent
and
was
wonderfully
bitter
but
not
overpowering
bready
hops
and
fruity
notes
were
also
found
mouthfeel
is
not
light
but
leaves
a
good
feeling
on
the
tongue
a
great
beer
one
id
come
back
to
again
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
bit
more
than
medium
anything
thicker
would
throw
this
one
off
quite
drinkable
i
wish
it
came
in
bigger
bottles
this
seems
to
be
the
baseline
of
the
english
strong
ale
category
all
others
should
be
classified
as
either
better
or
worse
than
fullers
1845
and
from
where
i
stand
most
will
fall
short
real
eye
candy
nice
dark
ruby
red
amber
color
with
a
substantial
frothy
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
and
taste
are
going
crazy
intensly
complex
up
front
fruityness
apples
and
ripe
dark
cherries
but
also
with
a
nice
dusty
mustyness
and
creamy
english
tea
element
soft
mellow
malts
and
herbal
floral
hops
this
beer
really
has
so
many
subtle
complexities
to
it
that
im
going
to
have
to
start
drinking
it
all
the
time
to
really
take
it
all
in
and
i
have
no
problems
with
that
its
excellent
balance
flavor
texture
its
all
there
bottle
conditioned
goodness
a
near
perfect
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
full
bodied
delicious
indeed
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
be
careful
this
is
good
stuff
i
only
see
this
beer
once
in
a
while
in
stores
too
bad
i
dont
see
it
more
often
comments
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
is
a
masterful
mix
of
subtlety
and
brashness
overall
a
nice
brew
that
id
pare
with
something
like
a
beef
stew
or
shephards
pie
strong
and
on
the
bitter
side
reminds
me
a
lot
of
anchor
osa
just
not
so
spiced
the
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
weak
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
some
crystal
malts
it
seems
dry
and
a
bit
breadlike
with
little
hops
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
dry
and
bitter
flavor
that
is
bland
and
stale
it
goes
down
slow
and
reveals
its
elevated
abv
in
the
finish
it
has
a
decent
malt
palate
that
consists
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
there
is
also
english
hops
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
i
dont
care
for
the
grain
bill
or
the
hop
selection
its
one
and
done
for
me
ill
tell
you
that
i
dont
think
my
tastebuds
are
quite
developed
enough
to
truly
appreciate
the
subleties
of
this
one
i
may
come
back
in
a
couple
of
years
to
see
if
it
has
changed
have
to
remember
to
buy
another
tommorrow
nice
dark
copper
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
real
nice
looking
malty
nutty
and
mild
roasted
coffee
qualities
to
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
nutty
caramel
maltiness
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
the
is
a
pear
like
fruitiness
mid
range
followed
by
more
hops
than
expected
lending
some
balance
and
herbal
flavor
a
little
sweet
alcohol
at
the
finish
one
thing
i
notice
is
that
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
which
definitely
adds
to
its
drinkability
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
as
my
english
mates
would
say
this
stuff
is
fukin
brilliant
lol
great
stuff
highly
recommended
this
stuff
is
like
medicine
not
the
kind
of
stuff
you
had
to
be
forcefed
as
a
kid
but
the
kind
you
just
feel
better
after
drinking
if
food
for
the
soul
had
a
beverage
this
would
be
it
it
had
been
years
since
i
last
tried
this
beer
and
it
was
just
as
great
as
i
remembered
it
when
i
think
of
a
classic
english
ale
this
is
the
beer
that
immediately
jumps
into
my
mind
man
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
pours
a
deep
coppery
red
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
full
head
that
laces
the
glass
nicely
and
takes
some
decent
time
to
recede
aromas
are
quite
malty
giving
off
some
plummy
dark
fruit
tones
along
with
some
caramel
and
biscuity
malts
initial
flavors
start
off
decently
sweet
with
some
dark
fruity
notes
giving
off
flavors
of
plums
figs
and
slight
grape
the
body
of
this
brew
is
quite
full
and
very
malty
there
are
additional
tones
of
of
a
slight
roasty
chocolate
flavor
but
they
are
quickly
consumed
by
more
fruity
tones
and
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
finish
is
just
slightly
hoppy
and
balances
the
flavor
of
this
brew
nicely
overall
a
great
beer
full
of
flavors
that
just
balance
out
nicely
a
must
try
very
good
extra
strong
bitter
deceptively
strong
in
fact
its
nice
but
somehow
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
taste
very
tasty
ale
very
drinkable
aroma
is
unique
very
understated
but
is
predominated
by
a
spicey
treacle
smoked
oakfruity
aroma
front
is
very
smooth
with
a
good
caramel
malt
presence
and
a
good
malt
mix
punctuated
by
smokeyoak
coffee
nutty
sweetness
balanced
with
the
piney
hops
that
become
more
prominent
in
the
finish
as
the
malts
drop
away
and
the
piney
hops
become
slightly
bitter
long
lingering
metallic
after
taste
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
ale
nicely
balanced
complexity
and
warming
care
and
effort
have
been
taken
in
the
production
and
ingredients
and
it
shows
fully
recommended
this
beer
is
worth
every
hard
earned
penny
that
it
cost
it
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
and
has
a
very
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
in
my
glass
it
smells
very
yeastyfruity
and
malty
and
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
in
there
too
it
has
a
very
smooth
complex
taste
that
shows
the
brewers
skills
the
hoppiness
is
balanced
well
with
the
spicymalty
flavors
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
a
fullers
brew
and
this
is
the
best
i
have
tried
so
far
i
will
be
revisiting
this
beer
often
a
very
drinkable
ale
its
a
strong
ale
but
doesnt
kick
very
hard
id
probably
switch
to
something
a
bit
more
adventurous
before
the
night
is
over
though
tastes
of
soft
fruit
grapeinfused
bread
malts
notes
of
oak
minerals
earth
and
sweetish
brandy
come
out
in
the
middle
near
the
finish
herbal
hops
provide
a
bitter
floral
taste
good
balance
here
finish
is
bitter
with
a
side
of
brandyish
malt
and
hints
of
yeast
flint
and
alcohol
yum
soft
minerally
yet
creamy
feel
to
this
modestly
bigbodied
ale
highly
recommended
overall
quite
good
definitely
recommended
but
not
exceptional
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
thats
creamy
and
long
lasting
with
nice
lacing
makes
this
look
like
a
great
english
ale
the
smell
is
sweet
butterscotch
with
a
creamy
tangy
sweet
taste
mainly
of
caramel
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
spicy
tangy
maybe
a
little
too
much
and
while
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
because
others
in
the
style
i
enjoy
are
much
more
drinkable
this
is
subtle
yet
bold
a
very
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
this
is
an
excellent
strong
english
ale
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
the
malthop
complexity
i
was
surprised
by
the
assertive
hops
in
this
one
but
it
comes
off
well
balanced
an
excellent
pairing
for
stilton
blue
cheese
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
as
well
goes
down
easy
and
found
myself
finishing
the
pint
much
more
quickly
than
i
would
have
expected
for
this
style
of
ale
brown
500
ml

label
bottle
conditioned
one
of
the
best
english
ales
ive
ever
had
good
session
beer
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
ale
with
minimum
head
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
roastiness
also
noticeable
taste
is
what
im
always
looking
in
a
bitter
even
though
this
isnt
one
per
say
but
can
rarely
find
i
e
sharp
bitterness
mixed
with
some
roasted
malts
the
alcohol
even
thought
not
noticeable
at
first
gives
it
a
great
feeling
probably
one
of
the
best
fullers
apart
from
the
vintage
series
brownish
amber
low
carbonation
provides
almost
no
head
very
malty
aroma
totally
dominates
the
old
hops
hints
fruity
plums
grapes
toasted
bread
and
roasted
nuts
maltiness
notes
of
cake
oak
cloves
nutmeg
surprisingly
has
a
moderate
acid
bite
that
hurts
a
bit
the
roundness
and
development
of
the
deep
malt
flavors
slight
smoke
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
low
carbonation
this
is
not
as
well
elaborated
as
the
vintages
in
terms
of
flavor
balance
and
appears
a
bit
disappointing
to
me
deep
plummy
brown
color
and
coiling
creamy
foam
formations
on
top
the
aromas
are
of
brandy
fruits
and
liqueur
it
is
very
much
like
a
plump
jammy
red
wine
only
toss
in
more
mocha
and
toffee
more
than
an
oak
barrel
could
account
for
that
must
be
from
the
toasted
grain
bitter
bitter
and
exotically
nuanced
with
asian
incense
buttered
charred
pastries
fruit
preserves
and
shoe
leather
quite
tannic
and
boozy
the
save
comes
from
the
generously
gassy
beaten
cream
texture
it
lifts
away
on
the
finish
lightly
leaving
a
deep
scar
of
ash
mushroom
and
forest
flavor
brown
bottle
is
a
good
idea
good
color
well
hopped
very
drinkable
roasted
without
overt
coffee
some
smoke
in
aftertaste
an
example
of
great
bottle
conditioning
nice
lace
and
graininess
bit
of
harsh
bitterness
but
still
very
balanced
some
spicy
malt
barelywine
notes
a
must
try
frothy
eggshell
head
nice
and
bubblebathy
amber
colored
with
beading
no
retention
though
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
mainly
with
a
slight
covering
on
the
top
very
light
arona
not
much
coming
out
at
you
slight
scents
of
yeast
nice
smooth
feeling
medium
bodied
maybe
a
tad
more
makes
me
think
of
a
porter
with
its
body
and
flavors
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
hops
bit
of
red
wine
just
good
decent
drinkability
not
much
intensity
of
flavor
or
too
heavy
good
stuff
drinkability
a
complex
wellbalanced
ale
with
a
big
malt
flavor
that
is
best
sipped
for
full
enjoyment
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
a
brilliant
red
color
with
a
massive
rocky
head
and
loads
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
jam
toffee
and
barley
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
definite
fruit
character
theres
a
lot
of
berries
and
and
none
of
the
toffee
found
in
the
nose
there
a
very
weak
hop
profile
literally
just
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
apparently
its
brewed
with
only
goldings
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
almost
oily
a
very
solid
beer
but
tied
with
golden
promise
as
my
least
favorite
fullers
brew
1845
is
light
cherry
coloured
in
the
glass
rosewood
dark
honey
amber
pouring
with
just
enough
head
which
is
thick
and
spiderweblike
but
recedes
rather
quickly
leaving
entrails
of
offwhite
lace
some
of
it
clinging
to
the
glass
for
good
sweet
lightly
scented
malt
in
the
aroma
at
first
buttery
and
lightly
roasted
spicy
and
biscuity
with
definite
butterscotch
notes
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
aroma
though
there
is
very
little
to
complain
about
the
taste
is
the
same
sweet
roasted
malt
with
butter
and
cream
followed
by
strong
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
in
between
are
some
subtle
fruits
yeasty
esters
and
the
warming
phenolic
presence
burnt
cereal
and
caramel
adequate
carbonation
and
smooth
substantial
feel
in
the
mouth
for
some
reason
i
am
finding
the
robust
bitterness
a
bit
much
this
night
limiting
its
drinkability
for
me
personally
not
my
favourite
of
fullers
but
still
so
much
better
than
a
great
deal
of
other
ales
fullers
never
disappoints
me
to
me
this
is
the
standard
of
the
esa
style
its
a
thing
of
beauty
to
see
smells
like
an
amped
up
english
bitter
adds
some
complex
fruiting
and
alcohol
to
the
taste
big
in
the
mouth
but
not
heavy
and
goes
down
smooth
as
silk
a
winner
in
all
categories
this
is
one
of
those
rare
brews
that
taste
more
alcoholic
than
it
actually
is
i
would
have
guessed
8abv
really
a
nice
beer
a
well
made
english
ipa
not
quite
the
american
overhoppy
apa
but
just
an
in
your
face
yummy
beer
with
hops
cheers
pours
a
nice
dark
hazle
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
incredible
lacing
coats
the
glass
the
smell
is
complex
yet
perfectly
right
the
english
hops
and
the
nice
caramel
malts
really
stand
out
hints
of
roasted
malts
as
well
bread
citrus
cinnamon
is
noticable
the
taste
is
incredible
the
hop
bitterness
is
refreshing
and
will
bring
you
coming
back
to
more
while
the
molasses
sweetness
fills
the
stomach
and
fulfills
the
sweetooth
medium
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
i
went
to
the
beer
store
today
and
i
decided
to
hit
up
some
classics
this
one
was
a
big
one
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
pours
a
deep
redbrown
that
glows
orange
held
up
to
the
light
head
is
moderate
light
lace
and
offwhite
i
dont
smell
anything
particularly
distinct
taste
is
extremely
different
from
most
beers
ive
tried
the
hop
profile
is
there
and
quite
distinct
but
so
unusual
i
have
a
hard
time
putting
my
tongue
on
it
at
first
i
was
so
shocked
by
the
taste
that
i
was
ready
to
criticize
but
nearing
the
end
of
my
bomber
ive
found
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
its
wild

exactly
like
my
experience
learning
to
love
ipas
mouthwatering
and
full
of
that
unique
hop
profile
from
first
sip
until
the
aftertaste
20
seconds
later
a
must
try
for
serious
beer
advocates
this
is
a
style
im
inspired
to
imitate
homebrewing
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
puppy
this
is
a
very
hoppy
ale
you
can
really
taste
the
english
hops
in
this
one
the
alcohol
presence
is
also
very
high
which
hurt
its
drinkability
significantly
the
malty
backbone
is
solid
but
just
cant
do
enough
to
mask
the
alcohol
taste
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
just
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
full
halfinch
of
head
which
did
not
last
the
tasting
poured
a
medium
amber
based
color
nutty
aromas
taste
is
slow
at
first
but
then
when
it
goes
down
the
full
flavor
appears
it
tastes
like
nuts
and
malt
and
a
hint
of
raisin
with
many
nice
lovely
green
hops
adding
to
that
bitter
bite
which
i
love
this
beer
goes
down

with
a

head
flavor
was
very
mellow
and
smooth
raisins
coffee
chocolate
dates
nuts
were
all
present
in
this
amazing
sample
alcohol
gave
it
a
satisfying
warming
feeling
still
had
some
hops
finish
to
it
but
it
was
evident
that
it
was
somewhat
diminished
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
delicious
stuff
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
would
have
to
wait
3
years
for
it
to
taste
this
good
again
this
is
a
very
nice
and
bold
ale
from
the
old
country
a
must
try
for
those
who
can
find
it
now
if
i
could
only
get
like
45
pints
of
this
on
cask
fantastic
ale
something
to
savour
a
real
classic
one
of
my
favourite
ales
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
english
ale
its
outstanding
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
light
orange
hintawesome
aromas
of
brown
sugar
and
orange
big
and
expressive
for
sure
taste
is
rich
and
complex
even
more
so
as
it
warms
more
towards
room
temp
great
malt
tilted
beer
i
get
big
brown
sugar
and
nutty
flavors
and
a
long
fruity
finish
with
a
yeasty
note
a
great
beer
to
savorman
fullers
make
some
truley
great
ales
incredibly
dry
mouth
feel
earthy
too
earthy
the
bitterness
is
rampant
and
the
caramel
is
too
weak
to
balance
either
the
alcohol
or
the
hops
which
is
surprising
considering
it
is
only
6
3
percent
i
do
not
see
any
of
the
butteryness
or
complexity
everyone
is
talking
about
very
nice
but
heavy
session
beer
if
you
like
getting
drunk
doesnt
scream
drink
me
but
is
robust
enough
to
satisfy
nothing
spectacular
but
quite
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
earthenbrown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
floral
hops
yeast
and
roasted
malts
the
flavors
are
incrediblesoft
doughy
maltiness
great
hop
balance
yeast
and
grains
ripe
fruit
up
frontcaramel
and
cracker
and
spice
its
a
wonderful
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
soft
and
moderately
oily
solidly
drinkableevery
sip
invites
a
followup
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
and
from
which
im
sure
i
wouldnt
be
tempted
to
stray
very
smooth
very
easy
drinking
exceptionally
enjoyable
this
beer
is
consummately
refinedthe
perfect
british
ale
this
fullers
1845
is
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
it
pours
a
little
hazy
copper
colour
into
the
glass
the
head
is
long
lasting
creamy
white
leaving
a
nice
ring
of
lace
on
the
glass
it
has
a
big
fruity
hoppy
smell
and
some
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
is
rich
and
fruity
with
some
roasted
aftertaste
the
bitterness
is
quity
massive
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
is
perfect
for
this
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
from
fullers
at
least
it
was
drinkable
to
say
the
least
ill
be
having
this
one
again
soon
drinkability
excellent
true
classic
example
of
a
brittish
strong
ale
pint
as
true
as
you
can
get
over
here
without
it
coming
from
a
cask
anyway
i
shall
have
to
have
another
not
much
of
a
head
but
a
fine
copper
color
with
a
hazy
yeast
appearance
it
smells
good
a
mild
but
nice
malt
flavor
which
finishes
with
a
hops
explosion
at
the
end
quite
nice
it
may
be
mellow
from
age
and
bottle
conditioning
not
sure
the
taste
is
complex
yet
i
found
it
somewhat
avoiding
and
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
its
special
character
i
have
to
compare
it
with
fullers
esb
one
of
my
favourite
ales
and
my
conclusion
is
that
1845
is
common
ale
with
some
extra
alcohol
while
esb
is
ale
with
extra
everything
more
alcohol
more
malt
more
hops
and
more
grit
550ml
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
thick
foamy
head
some
english
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
bready
malt
palate
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
yet
smooth
flavor
seemed
fairly
simple
and
nothing
that
i
was
hoping
for
i
really
think
the
esb
is
better
than
this
one
overall
a
decent
english
ale
however
nothing
deserving
of
an
exceptional
rating
the
1845
poured
a
copperred
with
a
thick
creamy
lighttan
head
that
retained
well
with
decent
lacing
it
has
a
yeasty
biscuit
aroma
with
some
fruitiness
and
some
sherrylike
alcohol
notes
its
taste
was
initially
toasted
malt
and
caramel
with
some
fruitiness
and
then
a
late
crisp
slighty
bitter
finish
it
was
pretty
fullbodied
and
went
down
really
smooth
overall
the
1845
is
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
bottle
marked
best
before
30
sept
2002
pours
with
a
very
substantial
head
nearly
out
of
control
enormous
and
sticky
dense
yellowwhite
bubbles
surge
and
froth
pillowing
into
a
crowning
mesa
rather
auburn
in
color
when
held
to
light
shimmers
an
electric
bronze
and
metallic
apricot
with
streamers
everywhere
racing
to
the
lip
of
the
glass
stunning
smells
of
a
tropical
marmalade
of
sweetnesses
mango
and
papaya
when
cool
shifting
to
cantaloupe
with
warmth
a
tad
of
biscuity
maltiness
beneath
this
an
underlayer
of
grass
and
loam
as
if
inhaling
a
meadow
nosefeel
is
ambrosial
wafting
biscuit
is
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
up
front
followed
by
an
affirmative
citric
and
grassy
bitterness
gets
quite
yeasty
in
the
midpalate
with
the
flavor
of
rising
dough
displacing
an
initial
light
fruitiness
apricot
finishes
with
a
pointed
earthy
bitterness
with
suggestions
of
mint
mouthfeel
is
slightly
plain
in
body
with
a
ticklish
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
resiny
and
the
drinkability
after
a
few
initial
sips
i
went
straight
into
quaffing
oh
for
another
bottle
its
mellow
and
warm
and
round
theres
nothing
harsh
or
overpowering
but
it
never
lacks
for
flavor
and
it
slides
semisweetly
as
the
bitterness
idles
softly
throughout
its
not
so
much
balanced
as
artfully
blended
a
testament
to
craftmanship
and
the
simple
combination
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
has
just
enough
going
on
to
intrigue
but
not
so
much
that
it
ever
overwhelms
i
may
be
getting
a
bit
too
old
to
jump
through
hoops
for
this
beer
but
i
would
certainly
walk
a
mile
this
is
the
beer
to
have
nailed
this
british
old
ale
style
perfectly
aggressively
poured
this
beer
is
gorgeous
gives
it
a
beautiful
white
head
atop
the
deep
orange
body
dont
tilt
the
glass
much
dry
fruity
and
very
malty
aroma
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bit
dry
though
it
remains
rather
soft
with
a
hint
of
acidity
has
that
full
robust
english
ale
flavor
character
rich
and
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
bitterness
is
quite
present
but
is
tamed
by
the
massive
toasted
malt
character
i
would
love
to
have
this
with
some
roasted
chicken
to
me
this
would
pair
so
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
very
well
balanced
the
definition
of
english
ale
drinkable
if
you
like
an
astringent
dry
ale
this
is
an
exceptionally
colored
beer
deep
sunset
amber
color
with
a
puffy
offwhite
head
full
of
crags
and
bubbles
with
tiny
rocky
lack
wherever
the
head
stuck
the
aroma
was
rather
enticing
with
huge
complex
and
balanced
notes
of
juicy
fruits
deep
rum
soaked
raisins
slight
floral
hops
with
tantalizing
notes
of
juicy
estery
alcohol
taste
had
a
more
smokey
metallic
taste
with
grainier
malts
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
warming
alcohol
presence
as
the
liquid
moved
down
my
throat
and
a
bready
full
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
pleasantly
carbonated
without
any
intrusion
this
is
an
exceptional
and
understated
old
ale
from
england
and
a
welcome
companion
on
a
cold
christmas
season
night
innew
england
tastes
of
caramel

a

bonus

oh
baby
where
have
you
been
all
my
life
this
is
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
lingers
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
sweetness
with
undecurrents
of
toffeecaramel
fortunately
the
taste
manages
to
exceed
the
high
expectations
the
smell
creates
in
addition
to
the
toffee
flavor
a
bit
of
toasted
biscuit
flavor
is
present
it
all
works
together
perfectly
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
superb
creamy
and
fulfilling
but
somehow
eminently
drinkable
at
the
same
time
why
did
i
buy
just
one
beautiful
dark
caramel
color
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
malts
the
greatness
of
this
beer
is
that
the
aroma
is
what
you
get
in
the
taste
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
is
in
tune
with
each
other
theres
a
bit
of
burnt
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
malt
in
the
finish
i
like
this
beer
this
celebration
english
ale
pours
a
darker
shade
of
amber
with
a
small
head
that
stays
the
smell
is
malty
and
strong
the
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
all
around
a
top
notch
english
ale
that
has
put
in
its
time
in
the
bottle
wow
superb
pours
a
clear
deep
ambercaramel
color
with
a
modest
tan
head
the
smell
of
roasted
caramel
buttered
bread
and
malt
smells
delicious
the
taste
is
that
of
burnt
caramel
with
a
biscuity
and
nutty
flavor
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
out
of
this
world
the
balance
of
hops
in
this
brew
is
a
perfect
match
fullers
esb
was
one
of
my
favorites
and
this
one
i
like
even
better
this
beer
suits
me
perfect
cheers
i
likened
this
to
a
scottish
ale
with
more
hops
than
usual
it
has
a
very
dark
copper
hue
with
a
nice
head
and
leaves
great
lace
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
cask
conditioned
ale
very
malty
at
first
and
then
hops
start
to
come
out
a
bit
more
nice
solid
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
good
goes
well
with
a
hearty
meal
nice
offering
from
fullers
i
was
not
impressed
w
this
beer
the
1st
time
i
had
it
several
years
ago
i
found
it
out
of
balance
with
a
harsh
bitterness
this
bottle
has
been
aged
im
not
sure
for
how
long
but
its
well
over
a
year
and
the
perceived
bitterness
is
greatly
reduced
and
the
flavor
is
much
rounder
really
nice
rich
but
also
quite
drinkable
due
in
great
part
to
its
lightly
tart
fruitiness
id
definitely
recommend
aging
this
beer
for
at
least
6
month
prior
to
tasting
mostly
clearish

close

many
of

there

things
on
the
palate
you
can
detect
the

toasted

a

emmmm
so
good
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
fullers
very
interesting
beer
more
subtle
i
think
than
the
esb
where
the
esb
hits
you
with
its
full
chewy
maltiness
the
maltiness
in
this
beer
is
more
subdued
and
youre
actually
slammed
by
the
bitterness
the
first
couple
of
sips
as
you
get
used
to
the
bitterness
youll
start
to
notice
the
sweet
maltiness
although
this
is
still
more
subdued
than
in
the
esb
a
little
later
especially
after
the
beer
warms
up
youll
start
to
notice
some
toffee
notes
starting
to
mix
with
the
maltiness
and
slightly
citric
bitterness
i
even
noticed
the
occasional
slight
hint
of
banana
but
im
not
sure
if
i
wasnt
just

and
formed
a

that
left

as

subsided
the

all
of

beers
balanced
or
what
ive
tried
this
and
the
esb
and
have
been
big
time
impressed
with
both
i
cant
wait
to
try
their
other
brews
now
were
talking
the
best
from
fullers
for
me
better
than
there
vintage
ale
lots

perhaps
a
buit
to
easy
to
drink
for
the
amount
of
flavour
there
is
as
another
fullers
product
this
ale
demands
comparison
to
my
alltime
favorite
esb
not
quite
as
full
in
flavor
a
little
less
fruity
a
little
less
carbonated
a
little
more
yeasty

a

notes
this
ale
has
been
bottled
conditioned
since
1995
in
celebration
of
fullers
150th
anniversary
ale
a
well
made
balanced
ale
especially
for
putting
it
though
so
much
travel
dark
and
quite
sweet
with
a
great
body
and
quite
a
rich
flavoursome
taste
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
cask
beers
ive
had
and
another
i
wouldnt
might
trying
a
bottle
of
in
future
good
body
feel
and
depth
a
very
pleasant
beer
all
round
this
review
is
an
unabashed
attempt
to
levelout
the
ridiculous
reviews
of
bottles
that
are
1215
years
old
this
beer
shouldnt
be
aged
and
those
that
have
and
then
have
unfairly
rated
it
should
be
ashamed
if
i
came
on
here
and
slated
an
aged
bottle
of
pliny
then
id
get
slated
in
return
so
why
is
this
any
different
to
quote
a
previous
reviewer
suck
it
good
stuff
all
round
overall
is
this
the
same
damnnear
lifechanging
beer
i
had
back
in
2005
on
cask
at
the
york
brewery
well
not
quite
i
managed
to
pop
into
the
brewery
this
past
summer
to
grab
a
halfpint
after
a
whirlwind
tour
of
yorks
city
center
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
if
not
remarkable
i
also
had
a
bottle
this
summer
in
york
and
it
was
meh
this
on
the
other
hand
i
believe
from
a
fresher
batch
is
really
quite
tasty
if
as
i
said
a
bit
more
bitter
than
id
like
for
the
style
i
tasted
this
blind
and
man
was
i
confused
whod
have
guessed
a
black
bitter
plenty
of
roast
very
umami
but
light
enough
to
be
drinkable
satisfying
this
ones
seen
better
days
though
it
wasnt
even
the
most
vile
beer
i
drank
that
evening
overall
this
beer
is
13
years
old
and
i
cant
believe
i
had
the
chance
to
actually
drink
this
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
never
thought
i
would
be
able
to
try
but
thanks
to
mrvonzipper
i
got
the
chance
and
i
am
eternally
in
his
debt
oh
yeah
the
beer
sucks
overall
its
pretty
bad
but
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
the
nose
is
still
great
but
everything
else
has
turned
to
crap
an
excellent
ale
i
reckon
this
to
be
the
best
of
york
brewerys
fine
offerings
it
has
a
rich
flavour
that
would
round
off
a
session
nicely
well
worth
seeking
out
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
on
cask
at
the
brick
store
pub
gravity
pour
as
well
which
was
nice
pours
a
beautiful
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
has
a
relatively
thick
pancake
head
that
is
offwhite
some
nice
lacing
smells
grainy
including
a
touch
of
grain
sourness
as
well
as
some
gentle
cocoa
and
roasted
notes
perhaps
a
little
touch
of
coffee
as
well
the
taste
is
really
very
nice
rich
and
full
but
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
pleasant
light
nuttiness
more
cocoa
notes
and
some
very
light
creamy
roastiness
sweet
and
creamy
on
the
finish
with
some
light
earthy
hops
there
is
a
touch
of
copper
throughout
as
well
as
some
subdued
dried
fruit
very
pleasant
pleasantly
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
just
wonderful
overall
a
very
nice
sessionable
brew
well
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
very
nice
cask
ale
with
a
excellent
malt
character
the
combination
of
light
toffee
and
red
apple
yeast
character
is
perfect
and
manages
to
work
with
the
mouthfeel
to
create
a
very
satisfying
drinking
experience
the
bitterness
is
stiff
but
just
enough
so
to
balance
everything
out
and
make
for
a
quaffable
brew
in
many
ways
this
is
exactly
the
sort
of
beer
that
i
think
of
when
i
imagine
drinking
in
a
british
pub
and
i
will
gladly
drink
it
again
whenever
i
have
the
chance
notes
best
before
28august2010
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
its
definitely
english
although
i
dont
think
it
fits
neatly
into
a
style
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
beer
worth
grabbing
one
if
you
can
rich
earthy
malt
flavour
and
low
hop
profile
very
nice
mouthfeel
low
natural
carbonation
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
but
it
is
a
little
heavy
and
even
the
brewery
itself
admits
its
not
really
for
session
drinking
this
was
a
very
tasty
highly
drinkable
brew
i
wasnt
about
to
mention
this
there
but
reminded
me
of
murphys
the
taste
was
light
and
pleasant
subdued
toasted
malt
tobacco
and
an
essence
of
honey
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
toned
down
and
mild
for
a
strong
ale
pretty
light
bodied
yet
went
down
very
easy
this
was
a
nice
cask
ale
nothing
too
wild
but
tasty
nonetheless
hmm
this
approaches
porterstout
territory
d
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
ales
of
the
festival
great
drinkability
also
when
in
york
make
sure
to
tour
the
brewery
very
interesting
and
informative
pours
dark
brown
earthy
and
woody
flavor
that
carries
a
slight
nut
tone
bitter
edge
is
there
for
sure
but
its
mature
enough
to
be
able
to
keep
it
pleasant
feel
is
smooth
with
a
low
but
slightly
biting
carbonation
its
pretty
smooth
and
nice
to
drink
d
an
impressive
ale
truly
deserving
a
medal
although
i
didnt
try
the
runnerup
and
bronzemedalist
in
the
same
category
to
make
a
detailed
comparison
somehow
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
revisit
that
beautiful
historical
city
again
maybe
combining
it
with
a
proper
pubbrewery
tour
in
keighley
and
yorkshire
countryside
i
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
on
my
trip
to
york
i
loved
this
beer
and
it
was
the
best
i
had
while
i
was
there
i
also
had
this
beer
from
a
bottle
at
a
later
date
and
i
must
say
cask
is
much
better
and
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
from
a
bottle
agin
but
i
very
much
want
to
go
back
to
york
for
this
beer
and
some
tourist
things
this
ale
poured
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
brown
with
light

persisted

the
smell
was

the
taste
was
mild
dark

with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a

of

hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium

and
low

the
hoppy
malty
flavor
lingered
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
very
nice
ale
a
solid
offering
from
adnams
to
be
sipped
in
the
colder
months
which
i
could
have
again
any
day
it
reminds
of
the
stronger
stouts
and
easily
the
best
ive
had
on
this
style
at
the
moment
had
to
edit
my

this

ideal
for
those
with
a

tooth
like
myself
overall
not
the
usual
beer
i
would
go
for
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
i
would
not
have
guessed
the
strong
alcohol
content
and
it
wasnt
as
thick
or
filling
as
i
expected
which
is
a
good
thing
for
me
a
beer
which
is
very
different
to
most
which
i
would
recommend
i
really
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
and
it
turned
out
to
be
pretty
solid
im
wondering
what
else
this
brewerys
getting
up
to
and
i
may
just
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
out
smells
of
an
even
blend
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
with
a
general
toasted
nuttiness
and
plenty
of
dark
fruits
the
bottle
wasnt
kidding
when
the
label
boasted
of
a
fruit
cake
aroma
the
flavor
follows
suit
mostly
with
a
touch
of
balancing
herbal
medicinal
hopping
a
faintly
metallic
ghostly
flavor
nuance
does
appear
as
the
glass
warms
up
but
rather
than
being
a
flaw
it
surprisingly
seems
to
provide
a
dab
of
extra
counterbalance
to
the
malt
sweetness
its
really
good
right
up
there
amongst
my
other
personal
favorite
english
offerings
an
approachable
and
conquerworthy
oldworld
strong
ale
the
subtly
of
it
all
clear
in
the
restraint
in
the
main
players
getting
lost
in
the
timid
though
distracting
enough
offflavours
to
note
mineral
and
must
which
sounds
like
an
old
judas
priest
song
still
rather
good
though
and
duly
representative
of
the
style
one
like
its
kin
having
lost
its
place
to
the
more
effusive
american
take
on
things
sadly
i
suppose
overall
interesting
pretty
much
a
good
example
of
an
english
strong
beer
that
has
characteristics
of
a
bitter
and
a
brown
ale
with
tons
of
molasses
cake
fruity
esters
biscuit
etc
and
the
hops
add
a
nice
bitterness
and
herbal
earthy
flavor
that
doesnt
go
to
the
icky

i
dont
like

with
a
bitter
finish
on
the
palate
body
is
good
with
a
satisfying
feel
and
not
over
carbonated
one
of
these
beers
was
enough
for
me
dnot
terrible
but
the
tartness
accumulates
overtime
making
the
bitter
aspects
somewhat
abrasive
could
be
slightly
more
balanced
overall
this
was
a
good
find
and
id
get
it
again
to
enjoy
once
in
a
while
with
a
heavy
meat
dish
overall
a
solid
brew
but
seems
to
be
in
need
of
some
minor
tweaking
i
was
surprised
at
how
pronounced
the
alcohol
was
in
both
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
considering
that
its
not
much
higher
than
the
standard
percentage
the
sweet
fruit
cake
character
in
the
nose
was
the
highlight
of
the
beer
for
me
this
ones
a
good
alternative
in
terms
of
pricing
to
fullers
offering

in

stick
with

over
warming
balanced
ale
notes
good
balanced
beer
most
of
the
flavor
is
malt
and
fruit
but
it
has
enough
hop
flavor
to
balance
out
d
not
the
most
drinkable
ale
and
definitely
not
a
session
one
however
it
was
quite
pleasant
to
drink
i
also
paired
it
with
some
aged
cheddar
cheese
which
was
an
excellent
combination
the
flavour
is
like
the
smell
very
clean
the
malt
is
light
and
not
too
sweet
some
mild
caramel
molasses
tones
the
finish
is
more
prominent
with
enough
hop
to
give
it
a
good
lowlevel
of
grapefruit
bitterness
which
lingers
well
after
the

with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some

aroma

light
dry
fruits
and
some
dry

is
mildly
interesting
taste
is
also
a
balanced
mix
between
some
medium
dry
figs
and
raisins
with
some
notes
of
dry
caramel
malt
body
si
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
signs
of
alcohol
i
thought
the
aroma
had
some
fruity
ester
that
could
have
lead
tom
something
interesting
but
the
taste
couldnt
really
match
up
with
the
rest
not
bad
overall
but
i
wont
seek
this
again
necessarily
a
solid
example
of
a
british
ale
great
and
at
6
3
abv
good
for
warming
one
up
this
time
of
the
year
not
a
bad
after
dinner
drink
but
the
carbonation
might
be
a
bit
filling
ill
pick
up
a
few
more
before
theyre
gone
overall
its
a
satisfying
drink
for
colder
weather
the
remaining
sugars
make
this
a
sweet
but
not
sickly
sipper
with
just
the
right
amount
of
body
to
provide
the
depth
and
meat
of
a
heavy
hitter
dark
ruby
body
topped
by
a
pile
of
beige
foam
the
head
is
moderately
retentive
and
leaves
behind
a
spotty
lace
lots
of
dried
fruit
in
the
aroma
scents
of
raisin
current
prune
and
toffee
remind
me
vaguely
of
fruitcake
maybe
thats
just
the
power
of
suggestion
given
by
the
blurb
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
regardless
this
stuff
smells
pretty
good
it
tastes
of
malt
bread
and
toffee
fruit
flavours
at
first
seem
more
mute
than
the
scent
suggests
but
come
forward
more
as
the
beer
warms
earthy
floral
finish
provides
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
smooth
flavourful
and
balanced
i
plan
on
drinking
more
of
these
while
its
still
to
be
found
on
lcbo
shelves
the
mouthfeel
is
adequate
but
nothing
special
and
the
hops
leave
a
slightly
unpleasant
bitter
aftertyaste
which
makes
the
beer
challenging
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
just
a
terrific
ale
well
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
certainly
good
for
a
session
although
the
abv
is
certainly
high
enough
to
warrant
caution
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
with
pizza
but
by
itself
its
a
respectable
ale
drinkability
worryingly
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
could
easily
see
my
drinking
more
than
recommended
in
one
night
the
heavily
malt
driven
flavours
are
rich
and
full
offering
a
superb
classic
english
ale
i
tried
this
beer
on
august

2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brownish
red
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
was
caramel
malt
and
wood
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
creamy
and
medium
carbonated
the
flavour
was
caramel
malt
some
spice
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
would
drink
again
but
only
under
the
right
circumstances
abv
on
my
bottle
actually
read

so
slightly
higher
than
listed
here
my
last
pick
at
the
beer
store
it
had
an
attractive
price
what
a
nice
suprise
thanks
to
shigadeyo
for
this
one
pours
a
murky
dark
redbrown
and
has
a
small
but
lasting

is

ripened
fruits
ashy
hints
mild
licorice
flavors
of
sweet
candied
malts

light
oaky
hints

sort
of
reminded
me
of
a
milder
youngs
old
nick
lightly
dry
and
bitter
in
the
finish
i
liked
this
one
alot
thanks
again
craig
for
this
nice
suprise
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
solid
malty
base
and
great
english
hop
character
good
stuff
even
with
the
moderate
abv
im
tempted
to
throw
a
few
of
these
in
the
cellar
and
see
how
they
change
i
think
that
caramelmalt
would
really
come
to
life
once
the
bitterness
mellowed
a
little
likely
approaching
more
of
an
old
ale
character
still
a
fine
brew
as
it
stands
today
d
this
is
a
great
strong
ale
smooth
and
complex
my
expectations
where
met
the
aroma
has
raisins
yeast
brown
sugar
and
carrots
the
appearance
is
redbrown
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
plenty
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
there
are
also
the
elements
from
the
aroma
the
palate
is
just
slightly
chewy
despite
some
good
qualities
it
has
a
medicinal
aftertaste
this
is
alright
a
good
english
strong
ale
something
i
would
recommend
this
may
be
a
lot
more
tame
than
something
like
the
fullers
vintage
ale
but
it
reminds
me
strongly
of
it
it
doesnt
have
the
peeking
alcohol
or
the
intensity
of
flavour
but
it
does
have
the
same
kind
of
satisfaction
come
an
empty
glass
this
works
for
me
on
so
many
levels
pints
at
the
pub
a
full
goblet
near
the
fireplace
or
with
a
hearty
meal
come
cool
weather
d
somewhat
complex
not
a
sessioning
beer
fairly
tasty
and
worth
trying
feel
is
quite
thick
and
syrupy
with
malt
sweetness
on
the
palate
a
bit
of
heat
very
smooth
though
carbonation
is
appropriate
finish
is

toasted

burnt

hmmm
i
like
the
look
and
aroma
more
but
this
isnt
too
bad
d
very

but
the
flavour
was
a
little

big
malty
brew
thats
easy
to
drink

kind

simplistic
and
the
alcohol
is

nice

but
carbonation
seems
a
little
much
too
spritzy
for
the
malty
flavours
you
get
imho
interesting
worth
a
try
quite
substantial
interesting
brew
but
ill
have
to
seek
out
more
examples
of
this

with

is

drinking
for

had
again
a

but
well
balanced
drinks
very
easy
despite
the
hops
not
really
being
simpatico
with
me
cask
broadside
about
1
2
weaker
was
one
of
my
go
to
real
ales
when
i
lived
in
england
this
isnt
a
bad
substitute
although
cask
will
always
be
better
a
solid
sessionable
strong
ale
overall
this
one
is
certainly
onpoint
for
an
english
strong
ale
one
of
the
best
representations
ive
come
across
this
one
is
the
real
thing
definitely
recommended
with
an
ultraeasy
level
of
drinkability
that
combined
great
flavor
and
taste
without
any
cloying
or
interfering
flavors
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
better
english
strong
ales
ive
had
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
if
there
is
a
cask
version
this
needs
to
be
found
fours
across
the
board
nice
auburn
color
with
a
small
but
firm
head
the
distinct
smell
includes
syrup
cake
and
preserved
fruits
the
palate
is
a
very
interesting
mixture
of
smoked
dark
wood
tropical
blueberries
and
tandoori
chicken
with
6
8
abv
this
is
rather
strong
stuff
broadside
is
best
enjoyed
as
a
after
dinner
digestive
where
it
faces
fierce
competition
from
some
belgian
trappist
brews
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
was
reasonably
strong
smooth
one
fine
english
strong
ale
i
look
forward
to
the
next
starts
of
tasting
rather
like
a
belgian
beer
as
the
nose
suggests
before
a
rather
more
sweet
kick
then
back
to
the
yeast
again
before
a
faintly
bitter
finish
the
feel
is
smooth
rendering
a
beer
which
could
otherwise
prove
cloying
relatively
drinkable
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try

this

im
quite
impressed
and
will
deffinitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
d
not
great
the

of
one
makes
you
not
really
want
another
not
crisp
and
refreshing
or
particularly
true
to
the
style
its
a
good
beer
but
not
really
what
it
says
it
is
recommended
for
dark
belgian
ale
fans
moreso
than
british
ipabitter
fans
adnams
broadside
is
a
good
example
of
the
english
pale
ale
enjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
beer
style
a
beer
i
think
would
be
much
better
on
cask
in
a
london
pub
on
a
warm
rainy
summer
afternoon
deep
rich
redbrown
color
slightly
cloudy
with
a
small
head
that
left
quickly
rich

in
the
nose
thin

taste
was
first
rich
malt
then
sweet
carmel
then
buttery
malt
then
slight
hop
tartness
with
a
bitter
solvent
aftertaste
very
complex
and
interesting
but
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
have
liked
still
worth
trying
12
oz

poured
into

looking

color
that
is
slightly
and
evenly
cloudy
very
little
visible

the

is
full
of
yeasty

theres
also
a
small
amount

noticeable
alcohol
medium

that
is
creamy
smooth
with
a
little
bit
of
stickyness
the
beer
seems
to
be
fuller
through
the
back
pronouncing
its
big

back
bone
after
getting
a
quick
blast
of
buttery
fruity
yeast
esters
and
english
hop
flavor
slight
medicinalsolvency
aftertaste
not
too
drinkable
in
my
opinion
but
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
alas
to
sweet
for
my
taste
but
a
nice
product
for
those
who
prefer
the
malts
in
my
humble
opinion
poured
to
a
brown
color
with
hints
of
ruby
red
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
lingereed
midway
and
left
okay
lacing
aroma
was
muted
but
slightly
nuts
and
caramel
flavor
was
somewhat
malty
sweet
and
while
body
was
fairly
creamy
any
true
flavor
was
diifficult
to
ascertain
although
only
6
3
the
alcohol
made
itself
known
toward
the
end
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
and
the
palate
and
finish
were
just
soso
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
mellow
for
the
style
adding
to
drinkability
a
fine
classic
example
of
an
english
strong
ale
a
powerful
beer
whose
characteristics
play
off
each
other
well
complex
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
pours
a
brilliant
goldenamber
with
a
generously
fruity
maltdriven
nose
and
a
dense
tan
head
of
a
rather
lengthy
duration
sharp
tangy
sweet
and
sour
are
words
that
come
to
mind
at
first
sip
this
strong
ale
6
has
plenty
of
character
and
tastes
darker
and
heavier
than
it
looks
if
that
makes
any
sense
flavorful
aromatic
malts
and
hops
tug
at
the
tastebuds
vying
for
your
undivided
attention
avery
subtle
hop
bitterness
lingers
at
the
end
of
the
palate
inviting
sip
after
glorious
sip
fruity
esters
abound
thanks
in
part
to
adnams
proprietary
yeast
strain
and
notes
of
citrus
joint
the
melee
struggling
for
attention
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
touch
of
creamy
smoothness
and
rather
lively
carbonation
in
some
ways
this
compares
favorably
with
fullers
1845
although
theres
no
such
yeast
deposit
nor
is
there
quite
the
booze
deposit
either
but
you
catch
my
drift
wonderful
stuff
edit
adnams
were
also
among
the
first
dozen
brewers
imported
by
minneapolisbased
all
saints
brands
i
hope
this
brew
sticks
around
for
a
while
this
time
too
bitter
for
me
actually
but
otherwise
a
fine
beer
adnams
broadside
original
ale
was
a
slightly
hazy
dark
redamber
color
with
a
large
light
tan
head
the
head
was
thick
and
longlasting
with
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
and
a
little
toasty
the
taste
was
malty
toasty
fruity
and
a
touch
peppery
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
malt
it
started
fairly
sweet
with
a
semidry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
full
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
was
very
good
but
i
still
feel
somewhat
disappointed
after
the
almost
amazing
appearance
stiill
a
highly
regarded
english
pale
ale
notes
tasted
pretty
damn
nice
missed
alot
of
the
other
categories
in
my
opinion
rather
heavy
for
the
style
in
the
mouthfeel
kinda
syrupy
at
times
bit
of
a
tinny
presence
as
well
all
told
this
is
probably
the
last
ill
have
of
this
in
order
to
pay
import
prices
ill
have
to
have
a
stunner
to
keep
up
the
purchases
all
kinds
of
hefty
malts
in
this
beer
this
would
probably
make
a
great
fall
season
ale
overall
an
excellent
strong
ale
recommended
it
looks
like
smithwicks
when
poured
yet
it
tastes
nothing
like
it
at
first
sip
you
can
tell
its
a
strong
ale
the
alcohol
and
hops
work
together
to
give
a
spicy
tang
and
warmth
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
two
pints
of
this
brew
a
lingering
hop
aftertaste
is
pleasurable
and
is
what
i
think
a
beer
should
taste
like
d
a
nice
ale
to
be
had
though
nothing
outstanding
im
not
huge
on
bottled
english
ales
that
have
made
the
journey
over
to
the
us
but
this
one
surprised
me
caramel
color
cappuccinolike
lacing
left
on
the
glass
great
bold
toffee
malt
and
biscuit
flavor
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
as
well
im
just
glad
this
didnt
turn
out
to
be
one
of
those
bland
forgettable
english
ales
which
it
certainly
is
not
and
actually
reminded
me
a
bit
of
fullers
esb
only
3
a
bottle
at
my
local
bar
not
bad
at
all
mouthfeel
a
little
dry
and
sweet
but
mostly
refreshing
this
beer
kind
of
made
my
palate
feel
relaxed
this
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
with
a
large
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
has
a
strong
dark
fruitprune
or
raisin
and
alcohol
aroma
the
taste
is
malty
with
dark
fruit
flavors
the
flavors
are
strong
except
for
the
malt
which
is
too
weak
for
my
tastes
the
mf
is
light
with
flavors
that
dont
mix
well
at
all
the
fruit
is
much
too
strong
with
the
malt
sweetness
being
an
afterthought
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
it
is
flawed
d
very
tasty
brew
alcohol
while
in
the
nose
seems
to
be
fairly
well
hidden
in
this
one
at
6
a
very
quaffable
strong
ale
has
that
unique
adnams
tangy
flavor
keep
up
the
good
work
lads
a
dark
amber
coloured
brew
with
a
white
cap
of
foam
the
aromas
are
hoppy
fruity
and
very
very
wellbalanced
the
taste
is
maltier
than
the
cask
version
and
the
added
abv
kick
is
noticeable
though
this
beer
still
stays
very
true
to
its
uk
roots
as
it
is
jam
packed
with
malt
complexity
and
sweetness
but
there
is
still
some
hop
character
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harder
edged
than
on
cask
but
the
drinkability
remains
lovely
or
is
that
lurvly
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
very
drinkableaye
me
buckoes
big
wink
better
yet
bottle
condition
it
age
it
a
year
and
youve
got
yourself
a
damn
fine
strongold
ale
come
on
you
know
you
want
to
pours
a
lovely
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
decent
head
nice
aroma
with
hints
of
fruit
and
sweet
malts
the
fruit
found
in
the
aroma
makes
a
return
in
the
front
end
of
flavor
and
fades
to
a
slightly
roasted
malt
flavor
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
the
flavor
was
the
peppery
finish
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
my
favorite
a
real
bargain
with
good
go
with
a
meal
quality
if
you
find
this
for
a
buck
go
for
it
indeed
a
good
decent
beer
and
at
5
99
for
a
four
pack
of
12
oz
bottles
this
one
is
a
great
value
theres
some
degree
of
alcohol
present
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
pretty
good
bringing
plenty
malt
flavor
to
the
mouth
alcohol
can
be
tasted
but
its
not
as
strong
in
the
taste
as
it
is
in
the
smell
hops
are
definitely
apparent
in
the
finish
drinkability
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
one
of
the
better
british
brews
i
have
tasted
d
less
satisfying
than
my
last
bottle
i
reckon
that
i
serve
this
one
slightly
warmer
15
c
and
that
might
be
the
culprit
nevertheless
this
is
still
a
quality
brew
worth
sipping
once
in
a
while
esp
now
in
winter
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
doesnt
make
too
many
demands
on
the
palate
but
at
the
same
time
is
more
interesting
tasting
than
a
typical
english
pale
ale
it
would
go
well
with
a
hearty
earl
of
sandwich
and
youd
probably
fare
better
than
mr
montagu
if
you
chose
this
tasted
110705
brought
back
from
uk
this
is
a
beer
with
a
distinctive
profile
the
beer
tasted
slightly
of
caramel
with
a
real
semisweet
malty
finish
i
really
liked
the
fact
that
it
created
its
own
identity
with
the
toffee
richness
big
head
on
a
pretty
light
brown
body
this
beer
is
a
real
charmer
in
the
90s
i
spent
a
few
months
every
year
in
england
and
scotland
and
made
a
point
of
drinking
as
many
different
beers
as
possible
so
i
am
surprised
that
i
never
had
adnams
before
poured
a
medium
copper
with
abundant
offwhite
head
smell
is
very
malts
combined
with
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
taste
is
fruity
mixed
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
finishes
smooth
good
drinking
beer
thanks
to
ba
mtanji
for
the
sample
i
like
this
one
a
lot
an
easy
drinker
that
is
worth
seeking
out
6
abv
is
well
hidden
but
could
catch
up
if
sessioning
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
strong
ale
that
i
would
buy
again
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
denmark
deep
copper
coloured
very
good
offwhite
head
nice
aroma
of
dark
fruits
leather
oak
and
caramel
malts
flavour
is
malty
sweet
with
a
certain
alcoholic
burn
but
not
unpleasant
some
raisin
notes
too
decent
hops
and
a
peppery
finish
not
bad
at
all
beautiful
looking
beer
a
red
tinged
brown
with
a
creamy
dense
head
that
is
of
mild
medium
size
smell
is
wondefully
complex
musky
lighly
hopped
aroma
some
nice
roasty
things
in
there
slight
fruitiness
on
the
nose
if
you
look
for
it
more
intensity
of
smell
than
most
beers
ive
had
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
base
malt
and
an
appropriate
degree
of
roast
malts
underneath
giving
way
to
a
sharp
little
hop
bite
when
the
slight
seetness
fades
good
slick
fullness
in
the
mouth
and
stays
in
the
mouth
for
a
long
time
it
has
all
the
intensity
and
complexity
i
love
in
a
world
class
beer
but
a
light
enough
hand
in
it
that
i
could
find
a
lot
of
these
empty
in
a
night
if
all
the
bottles
are
this
good
especially
for
1
79
pint
bottle
im
stocking
up
nice
beer
overall
pours
out
a
deep
amber
brew
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
smells
of
beer
i
thought
i
smelled
a
slight
bit
of
skunk
at
first
but
if
it
was
it
left
quickly
taste
of
sweet
malt
nicely
rounded
out
by
hops
very
subtle
goes
down
smooth
nice
sweet
lingering
aftertaste
pretty
good
brewwouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
around
500
ml
bottle
3
months
after
the
best
before
date
but
have
no
fear
this
beer
is
in
great
shape
dark
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
sweet
malt
aroma
with
subtle
fruit
and
toffee
chewy
malt
flavor
flavor
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
a
nice
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
great
balance
complexity
and
drinkability
its
hard
to
put
this
one
down
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
cask
it
must
be
orgasmic
until
that
day
keep
the
500
ml
bottles
coming
great
beer
burnt
reddishbrown
with
a
bubbly
creamcolored
head
that
fades
away
to
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
brute
aromatic
force
asserts
itself
through
the
tiny
opening
of
the
bottle
right
from
the
get
go
sweet
rotting
pine
forest
smothered
in
sap
flowers
and
alcohol
the
slightest
roasted
flavor
provides
a
welcome
accompaniment
to
the
sweetness
of
the
generally
smooth
sweet
malty
taste
almost
fruity
really
some
grassiness
and
a
mild
astringency
leads
to
a
potent
but
brief
burst
of
hops
very
thick
and
beefy
overall
an
interesting
ale
of
quiet
intensity
surprisingly
warming
with
only
6
abv
it
seems
to
me
this
ale
would
be
done
utmost
justice
straight
from
the
firkin
will
seek
this
out
on
tap
in
the
future
really
nice
deep
auburn
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
fruity
aroma
with
some
hops
but
a
little
vegetable
note
in
there
as
well
taste
is
very
creamy
on
the
mouth
with
a
rich
caramel
sweetness
and
good
english
hop
hit
on
the
backside
that
provides
a
fruityness
slight
buttery
note
actually
helps
the
smoothness
of
this
really
thick
chewy
bready
body
it
all
works
here
depth
is
an
issue
and
the
richness
could
be
overwhelming
after
a
few
but
overall
this
is
simply
a
really
well
made
english
ale
drinkability

this
one
is
a
mouthfull
thats
for
sure
it
is
thick
and
chewy
and
almost
needs
a
knife
and
fork
i
like
this
beer
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
while
adnams
ssb
was
pretty
good
stuff
broadside
strong
original
is
a
cut
above
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
the
whole
adnams
line
but
im
not
sure
theyre
available
on
this
side
of
the
pond
recommended
overall
this
beer
is
decent
though
nothing
special
its
worth
a
try
but
its
a
little
one
dimensional
with
the
malts
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
worth
a
try
i
couldnt
finish
this
beer
i
gave
it
to
my
friends
dog
it
was
like
drinking
metal
shavings
the
water
was
so
metallic
like
many
other
english
beers
it
had
a
decent
pour
with
a
decent
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
little
while
the
first
sip
was
like
licking
the
body
of
a
rusty
ford
once
i
got
past
the
metal
fragments
stuck
in
my
tongue
i
tasted
a
lot
of
what
i
smell
which
was
an
average
amber
ale
they
should
keep
this
one
in
england
other
comments
after
living
in
belgium
i
was
used
to
6
abv
as
the
norm
in
the
uk
this
is
considered
strong
sort
of
like
a
barley
wine

rather
complex
ale
thats
seemingly
a
hybrid
of
a
true
esb
and
english
old
ale
not
every
flavor
component
coalesces
and
ohanlons
this
isnt
quite
up
to
snuff
id
certainly
give
it
a
try
if
i
saw
it
on

i

a

golden

with
a

the

had
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
in
it
but
also
had
some
dark
fruits
and
apple
scents
to
it
as
well
the
taste
was
semisweet
with
almost
no

the

and
even
then
it
paired
well
enough
with
the
other

rjt
o
interesting
strong
ale
very
malty
not
my
favorite
brew
buy
worth
a
try
seriously
bad
indeed
an
okay
but
rather
blah
strong
ale
the
alcohol
presence
comes
across
as
the
most
distinctive
characteristic
which
for
my
preferences
id
rather
go
with
a
bourbon
a
more
maltlike
profile
with
a
more
distinctive
yeast
character
would
go
a
long
way
in
improving
this
beer
not
bad
per
se
and
drinkable
but
hardly
memorable
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
but
this
is
something
that
needs
to
be
done
slowly
because
its
rather
strong
and
there
are
some
notes
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
almost
slick
with
a
watery
feel
no
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
goes
down
easy
considering
the
heat
and
abv
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
perfect
for
washing
down
the
christmas
feast
with
a
little
bit
of
british
humor
o
this
beer
wasnt
bad
for
a
strong
ale
it
was
a
little
bit
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
little
bit
too
syrupy
however
at
least
these
characteristics
hid
the
alcohol
fairly
well
overall
not
bad
would
have
again
but
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
o
not
a
really
really
bad
beer
but
not
even
close
to
be
good
it
has
a
bit
of
a
nice
warming
feel
and
has
some
flavour
range
but
its
a
mess
and
its
not
that
much
drinkable
either
drinkability
it
is
okay
not
seriously
good
but
not
seriously
bad
seriously
though
i
doubt
i
will
ever
buy
it
again
o
someone
think
light
colored
beers
cant
be
strong
and
characterful
hand
em
onea
these
a
smooth
cold
weather
sipper
the
strong
alcohol
is
present
but
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
to
let
you
know
its
there
this
is
a
perfect
sipper
for
a
cold
winters
evening
pours
a
medium
gold
color
w
a
one
finger
white
head
the
head
quickly
disappears
not
much
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
this
beer
is
fairly
clear
in
appearance
you
can
see
right
through
it
the
nose
has
grain
malt
apple
and
a
slight
honey
smell
as
well
improves
as
it
warms
but
not
much
more
than
average
here
wow
the
taste
is
completely
different
than
the
nose
big
malt
and
honey
take
over
here
a
little
better
than
the
nose
i
dont
really
get
any
of
the
9
abv
in
the
taste
at
all
feel
is
light
syrupy
and
carbonated
w
a
hops
bite
on
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
style
i
havent
had
before
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
one
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
though
cheers
i
got
this
beer
for
a
good
price
and
have
never
had
a
british
beer
with
9
abv
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
the
pour
is
pretty
standard
with
more
of
a
soapy
head
that
dissipates
it
is
a
golden
beer
the
smell
is
faint
honey
and
grain
not
bad
the
taste
is
subtle
grain
malt
medicinal
and
more
honey
i
am
actually
surprised
i
dont
taste
much
alcohol
in
this
beer
pretty
good
i
would
just
prefer
a
bit
more
esters
to
spice
up
the
flavors
a
bit
worth
a
try
if
you
like
british
and
belgium
beer
d
to
me
this
is
a
lot
like
drinking
a
very
alcoholic
ale
version
of
most
big
time
industrial
lager
brews
before
you
put
it
up
to
your
nose
to
smell
it
the
lingering
odor
in
the
air
is
of
generic
beer
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
though
and
is
great
as
the
kickoff
to
a
good
session
but
other
than
that
and
getting
knocked
onto
your
ass
that
may
be
all
its
good
for
appearance
the
same
aroma
and
taste
have
softened
no
longer
boozy
improved
but
still
not
a
good
beer
body
is
somewhat
creamy
not
bubbly
but
still
a
bit
thinner
than
is
usually
expected
from
a
highalcohol
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overwhelming
but
does
help
mask
the
alcohol
content
i
am
kind
of
glad
that
i
split
the
bottle
with
my
wife
but
its
not
exactly
a
chore
to
drink
maybe
not
the
most
festive
holiday
ale
though
d
a
very
nice
strong
ale
happy
christmas
with
a
lot
of
flavors
borrowed
from
both
a
english
pale
ale
and
an
english
barlwyine
with
with
more
flavor
and
feel
than
the
pale
but
with
less
syrupiness
than
barleywines
the
beer
does
a
good
job
of
straddling
the
fence
nothing
to
remember
medium
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
slight
lemony
flavor
no
hops
hint
of
spice
and
an
overpowering
alcohol
aftertaste
they
definetly
got
the
strong
part
of
the
ale
d
high
abv
but
not
as
bold
as
i
like
its
okay
for
the
one
or
two
and
the
novelty
but
thats
about
it
d
good
brew
probably
low
drinkability
in
my
opinion
due
to
sweetness
alone
abv
second
drinkability
the
relatively
okayness
of
very
bad
elf
had
inspired
me
to
give
the
rest
of
these
goofy
beers
a
go
but
after
the
seriously
poor
showing
of
seriously
bad
elf
this
may
be
it
for
me
and
ridgeways
christmastime
lineup
mouthfeel
is
a
mediumlight
and
could
be
boosted
a
little
more
to
be
fuller
decent
beer
drinkable
curious
about
the
other
elves
i
also
bought
the
insanely
bad
elf
after
this
tasting
i
am
getting
a
little
nervous
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
a
bit
of
active
carbonation
keeping
things
interesting
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
pale
clear
amber
with
a
moderate
white
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
all
alcohol
rubbing
alcohol
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
strong
barley
wine
the
main
flavor
is
alcohol
but
it
is
not
overpowering
the
brew
is
a
medium
bodied
sipper
this
elf
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
d
this
beer
has
some
full
flavor
but
they
all
taste
a
bit
off
and
clash
together
there
are
no
real
malt
flavors
and
it
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
maybe
time
could
help
pull
things
together
but
i
dont
know
if
there
are
other
flavors
underneath
that
would
come
through
not
a
huge
body
medium
viscosity
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
fine
beer
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
ones
leans
toward
a
belgian
style
to
me
strong
pale
ale
or
something
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
very
faintly
of
caramel
malt
and
sweet
yeast
it
tasted
stronger
like
sweet
caramel
and
cultured
yeast
and
banana
with
a
bit
of
lemon
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
creamy
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
fairly
unique
and
clean
flavor
but
still
wasnt
as
bold
as
i
hoped
it
had
good
body
and
it
definitely
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
was
somewhat
enjoyable
but
was
generally
underwhelming
not
seriously
bad
number
three
of
the
fourpack
for
xmas
spicy
malty
fruity
taste
with
almost
no
head
on
the
pour
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
pretty
easy
to
identify
though
its
not
overpowering
to
the
point
of
uneasy
drinking
smell
is
nice
while
the
taste
is
not
to
my
liking
it
has
a
nice
copper
brass
like
color
it
has
a
soso
head
but
good
lace
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
scotch
or
irish
whiskey
there
is
a
processed
malt
aroma
with
just
a
bit
of
crisp
hops
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
whiskey
as
well
it
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
alcohol
to
the
flavor
there
is
not
much
for
bitterness
at
all
this
beer
has
some
fruity
esters
to
the
aftertaste
it
feels
almost
medium
bodied
but
not
quite
and
has
some
warmth
put
off
from
the
alcohol
i
love
the
elf
wearing
a
lumberjack
shirt
firing
a
christmas
ball
with
his
slingshot
this
bad
elf
is
a
cottonheaded
ninnymoggins
but
i
would
i
pass
through
the
seven
levels
of
the
candy
cane
forest
through
the
sea
of
swirly
twirly
gum
drops
and
then
i
walk
through
the
lincoln
tunnel
for
some
of
this
beer
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
the
alcohol
is
too
prominent
in
both
aroma
and
taste
its
also
a
bit
overspiced
in
my
opinion
but
not
terribly
so
not
a
bad
brew
but
if
the
booze
were
toned
down
a
bit
itd
be
much
better
drinkability
well
it
knocks
out
a
style
at
least
cant
say
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
a
little
chemically
in
places
alcoholy
in
others
and
just
decent
in
the
rest
my
first
ridgeway
beer
but
id
gladly
give
up
this
shelton
brothers
import
in
exchange
for
getting
any
of
their
others
here
in
virginia
drinkability
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
couple
pints
of
however
after
the
second
one
it
would
be
difficult
to
stomach
the
overall
sweetness
of
this
beer
not
to
mention
it
might
become
difficult
to
walk
after
32
ounces
of
9
beer
d
this
is
a
very
sweet
brew
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
drink

of

if
you
ask

despite

this

is

with
just
enough

to
keep

d

a
beer
by

that

not

for

at

an

certainly
has
a

feel
to
it
after
a
while
it
becomes
a
bit
on
the
big
side
almost
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
of
a
burden
to
work
through
so
perhaps
only
one
at
a
time
the
drinkability
is
just
average
there
are
many
better
choices
out
there
for
the
price
of
this
brew
to
recommend
it
mk
d
i
really
liked
it
it
was
a
very
easy
beer
to
finish
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
overall
not
bad
and
definitely
a
different
take
on
what
i
was
used
to
this
style
actually
intrigues
me
and
if
it
were
a
little
sweeter
i
think
it
would
have
turned
out
much
better
for
me
overall
but
still
i
cannot
say
it
was
bad
at
all
pretty
cool
actually
and
would
be
a
good
call
for
sure
finished
thin
and
watery
no
sign
of
any
alcohol
warmth
here
extremely
disappointing
and
gimmicky
drinkability
i
drank
about
half
of
it
for
some
reason
it
gave
me
a
headache
and
i
couldnt
drink
anymore
it
didnt
seem
strong
to
me
either
was
alright
i
only
bought
it
because
it
was
on
sale
like
40
off
slick
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
low
drinkability
i
predict
that
half
the
bottle
will
find
the
sink

else

id
go
back
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
fine
english
ale
i
would
not
have
guessed
it
would
have
been
9
however
at
8
50
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
on
again
wont
search
this
one
out
again
but
glad
i
gave
it
a
go
d
intriguing
aroma
and
interesting
flavor
though
it
doesnt
interest
me
enough
to
come
back
or
recommend
this
to
anyone
overall
not
enjoyable
for
me
taste
is
a
very
well
balanced
hop
countered
with
the
coriander
and
winter
spice
with
some
apple
pie
tossed
in
the
mix
another
fine
brew
give
it
a
try
whenever
possible

esp
when
they
toss
it
in
the

closeout
bin
har
drinkability
just
ok
this
one
threw
me
off
a
bit
i
was
expecting
something
different
after
the
pour
and
smell
than
what
was
delivered
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
creamy
offwhite
head
ligh
clear
color
aroma
was
just
plain
sweet
very
very
sweet
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
and
apple
as
with
the
aroma
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
it
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
up
at
9
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
there
were
a
couple
of
other
elfs
at
bullocks
but
i
wont
buy
any
more
green
apple
may
be
a
turnoff
to
some
with
beer
but
i
actually
found
this
to
be
quite
interesting
not
an
everydaydrinker
but
one
to
have
when
the
whim
hits
drinkability
just
not
very
beckoning
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
golden
yellow
color
the
taste
was
rather
sweet
and
several
people
tooka
taste
of
it
and
did
not
care
for
this
beer
it
was
high
alcohol
and
was
just
not
very
tasty
to
all
that
sampled
i
will
not
buy
again
pours
a
pale
gold
brilliantly
clear
with
a
good
size
persistent
head
that
leaves
lace
all
the
way
down
aroma
is
sharp
alcoholic
fruityestery
and
with
a
hint
of
hops
bit
too
sharp
really
there
is
also
some
green
apple
in
the
aroma
acetylaldehyde
flavor
is
alcoholic
upfront
but
with
some
nice
malt
along
with
crystal
and
some
hops
tail
is
rather
harsh
with
more
green
apple
acetylaldehyde
contributes
to
a
dry
astringent
mouthfeel
the
lower
alcohol
beers
in
the
series
are
better
perhaps
this
one
shows
the
limit
of
the
yeast
they
are
using
at
least
at
the
temperature
they
ferment
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
thick
white
fairly
persistent
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
whispers
of
fruit
maltiness
dominates
the
flavor
which
has
apple
undertones
rather
like
a
cider
and
a
strong
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
edgy
aftertaste
is
fruity
and
alcoholish
with
just
a
little
bitterness
this
english
strong
ale
pours
a
medium
orange
color
from
a
50cl
bottle
medium
sized
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
caramel
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
hops
a
medium
bodied
english
strong
ale
the
malts
are
caramel
fruity
and
sweet
the
hops
are
slightly
earthy
and
floral
a
weird
tasting
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
orange
peel
and
spices
but
there
are
also
a
bunch
of
stuff
that
tastes
like
vegetables
grain
and
something
that
might
be
better
left
unidentified
whats
even
more
distressing
is
the
bad
flavors
intensify
as
it
warms
again
one
cant
help
but
wonder
if
hepworth
spent
as
time
in
designing
the
beer
as
the
label
design
and
marketing
the
name
if
they
would
have
a
better
product
i
still
buy
them
once
and
am
usually
disappointed
but
i
still
buy
them
yet
again
another
ho
hum
bah
humbug
beer
ah
well
one
more
to
go
the
beer
is
a
little
watery
and
a
touch
thin
as
well
as
that
weird
taste
mouthfeel
is
thin
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
and
a
touch
vegetative
pours
a
yellowish
copper
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
gingerbread
and
a
hoppy
presence
in
the
taste
a
sweet
maltiness
and
a
very
nice
hop
presence
a
mellow
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
medium
hop
aftertaste
a
nice
hop
presence
and
a
bit
sweet
alcohol
overall
not
to
shabby
this
is
interesting
but
too
extreme
on
the
upfront
sweetness
this
beer
is
bad
elf
all
over
again
pours
a
slight
bit
darker
with
less
head
nose
is
the
same
ridgeway
funkiness
tastes
just
like
bad
elf
loaded
with
liquor
first
taste
is
funky
maltiness
almost
a
rotten
hop
or
citrus
flavor
to
it
the
finish
is
dominated
by
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
creamy
but
still
odd
drinkability
is
not
there
for
me
at
all
this
was
a
fine
winter
ale
it
has
a
typically
high
alcohol
content
as
many
winter
brews
however
it
was
extremely
drinkable
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
yet
without
as
much
of
a
bitter
edge
the
aftertaste
was
pleasant
and
nonoffensive
the
color
was
a
true
amber
not
yellow
not
exactly
orange
and
with
no
cloudiness
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
very
much
i
have
bought
a
few
more
of
these
even
though
the
price
tag
for
the
21
oz
bottle
was
a
bit
spendy
the
more
i
had
it
though
the
magic
seemed
to
fizzle
it
was
worth
the
time
and
effort
but
i
have
reevaluated
my
assessment
after
trying
additional
fine
english
ales
since
poured
a
medium
dark
amber
with
some
foam
and
also
a
little
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
spices
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
was
a
surprise
being
that
this
is
a
english
strong
ale
the
flavor
of
spices
was
a
little
weak
not
like
the
aroma
little
bitterness
and
sweetness
had
a
decent
balance
but
a
very
short
finnish
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
ale
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
soapy
white
head
after
a
rather
hard
pour
that
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
faint
i
pick
up
some
sweet
caramel
malt
and
perhaps
some
alcohol
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
and
boozy
and
has
a
cherry
cough
drop
characteristic
has
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
the
feel
is
light
and
almost
watery
fizzy
carbonation
and
finishes
slick
sticky
and
boozy
this
beer
is
what
i
imagine
english
malt
liquor
would
taste
like
the
malt
presence
is
not
big
enough
to
handle
the
strong
abv
of
this
brew
and
the
sweetness
is
almost
cloying
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
again
d
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
again
if
it
werent
so
pricey
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
if
it
werent
so
strong
the
only
reason
i
marked
this
lower
in
drinkability
than
the
other
factors
was
becasue
of
its
strength
otherwise
i
think
it
is
just
an
outstanding
beer
i
havent
had
many
english
strong
ales
malty
candyish
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
top
is
moderate
to
light

this
beer
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
mild
barleywine
or
a
spiced
cider
the
500
ml
bottle
of
seriously
bad
elf
poured
out
quite
similar
looking
to
the
very
bad
elf
i
tied
yesterday
about
the
same
orange
amber
color
but
carbonation
was
more
active
in
this
one
the
smell
of
this
beer
let
me
know
that
this
was
a
different
animal
altogether
the
aroma
was
significantly
stronger
here
as
a
result
of
more
hop
presence
and
more
alcohol
the
taste
was
closer
to
the
other
beer
than
the
aroma
indicated
but
it
was
less
sour
and
more
bitter
which
made
it
taste
a
touch
better
the
metallic
tinge
however
was
still
very
jarring
on
the
taste
buds
i
also
did
not
find
this
to
be
as
rich
and
soothing
in
texture
as
the
weaker
sibling
better
overall
beer
but
not
worth
purposefully
seeking
out
at
full
price
no
matter
how
bad
the
elves
get

chased
by
a

thick

not

but
perhaps
with
too
much
carbonation
tasty

good
job
covering
the
big

without
making
it
syrupy
for
a
beer
that
i
saw
and
thought
was
a
joke
these
elfs
certainly
are
worth
a
revisit
cheers
too
much
going
on
for
me

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
unless
youre
not
into
wild
spikey
spicy
brews
its
definitely
not
an
every
day
goto
beer
but
i
found
it
unique
and
interesting
and
it
gives
the
whole
truetostyle
thing
the
finger
yeah
a
seriously
bad
elf
a
medium
mouthfeelvery
creamy
the
alcohol
makes
for
a
bit
of
roughness
on
the
palate
a
good
beer
overallif
you
dont
mind
the
alcohol
tastes
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
went
down
very
good
even
with
the
alcohol
taste
i
would
drink
anotherbut
that
would
be
it
a
creeping
alcohol
effect
to
this
beer
id
recomend
this
beer
if
you
like
em
strong
drinks
very
easy
for
the
abv
this
beer
seems
to
have
north
american
influnces
on
it
most
strong
english
ales
skew
much
more
malty
to
me
pretty
good
one
to
enjoy
a
pint
or
2
pass
that
night
night
im
not
going
to
lie
this
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
heineken
and
i
dont
know
what
that
means
considering
its
an
english
double
ale
itd
be
a
good
heineken
though
but
thats
not
a
glowing
review
from
me
not
a
big
heineken
fan
and
ive
had
heineke
on
draft
in
holland
so
i
think
i
gave
it
an
honest
try
this
seriously
bad
elf
is
actually
seriously
bad
granted
it
has
some
nice
features
the
appearance
is
pleasant
clean
and
crisp
and
has
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
the
9
is
wellbalanced
too
and
there
are
some
other
characteristics
consistent
with
the
style
but
its
missing
something
i
dont
know
maybe
my
bottle
was
old
but
the
head
retention
and
clarity
makes
me
think
that
that
was
not
the
case
i
didnt
think
that
this
was
a
very
creative
product
outside
of
the
name
an
ok
to
good
strong
ale
to
enjoy
mild
and
english
toned
all
the
way
drinkability
its
quite
nice
at
first
but
not
really
out
of
the
ordinary
its
very
straightforward
in
its
maltiness
and
theres
not
much
yeasty
fruitiness
either
almost
like
a
strong
malty
lager
its
clean
and
wellbalanced
but
not
that
exciting
and
thats
where
it
falters
its
an
enjoyable
brew
for
the
first
pint
but
with
the
strength
that
it
carries
and
the
flavor
it
delivers
id
probably
stop
at
one
definitely
not
worth
the
paid
for
a
single
and
not
something
i
would
revisit
again
in
the
future
at
least
i
got
the
bottle
with
that
scary
elf
shooting
xmas
decorations
at
santas
sleigh
and
reindeer
pretty
funny
notes
at
9
abv
and
a
largerthanaverage
bottle
it
provides
a
good
buzz
but
the
alcohol
is
too
dominant
in
the
taste
after
sampling
this
one
and
the
very
bad
elf
earlier
this
week
im
not
all
that
inclined
to
try
the
rest
of
the
series
i
will
certainly
pass
on
this
beer
tastes
almost
exactly
like
the
very
bad
elf
with
more
alcohol
this
one
seems
less
balanced
and
more
flawed
surprisingly
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
the
overall
taste
isnt
good
and
lends
a
low
drinkabilty
in
my
opinion
perhaps
i
am
in
the
wrong
mood
but
this
one
really
missed
is
9
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
this
ridgeway
beers
lately
and
you
can
really
see
how
very
similar
they
are
each
the
bad
elf
seriously
bad
criminally
bad
etc
beer
just
brings
up
the
alcohol
and
malt
a
bit
but
for
the
most
part
they
all
taste
about
the
same
labels
are
nice
looking
but
the
beer
is
average
a
50cl
bottle
poured
an
orange
color
with
a
small
head
it
had
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
as
well
as
something
vaguely
caramel
a
fruity
apple
taste
noticeable
alcohol
which
i
thought
was
a
bit
intrusive
some
hops
tart
in
the
mouth
an
ok
beer
not
one
id
want
regularly
a
mild
flavored
english
ale
most
notable
for
its
toasted
malt
character
and
unmasked
alcohol
presence
a
strong
ale
that
ill
only
remember
for
its
9
abv
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
soapsuds
type
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
apricot
with
spicy
and
floral
hops
in
an
english
manner
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
is
concealed
fairly
well
taste
has
some
fruity
peach
notes
competing
with
an
unpleasant
metalic
note
and
a
dry
floral
hoppiness
a
hint
of
cardboard
is
distracting
the
9
abv
stays
hidden
all
the
way
through
and
that
may
be
the
major
plus
with
this
one
not
really
a
bad
effort
puts
me
in
mind
of
an
esb
on
steroids
the
taste
is
almost
ciderlike
very
alcoholic
with
a
noticeable
english
hop
presence
however
the
taste
is
far
too
thin
and
gives
way
to
overpowering
fusel
alcohols
the
alcohol
stands
out
too
much
and
doesnt
blend
into
any
other
flavors
pretty
blah
tangy
sour
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
definitely
worth
a
try
if
your
adventurous
ontap
at
the
blind
tiger
very
special
keg
night
and
indeed
it
was
this
was
an
interesting
dude
not
the
most
tasty
ever
but
then
it
is
a
bad
elf
alcohol
is
exceptionally
sneaky
got
some
red
wine
flavor
some
sweet
fruits
a
hint
of
sourness
light
and
goes
down
easy
and
creamily
though
a
bit
watery
not
my
favorite
but
im
glad
to
have
had
it
and
probably
will
again
seriously
bad
elf
is
a
serious
strong
ale
it
has
all
of
that
good
english
malt
flavor
a
little
bit
of
yeasty
aroma
and
a
solid
amount
of
hops
the
beer
is
copper
colored
with
a
white
head
and
bottle
conditioned
this
beer
falls
somewhere
between
a
barleywine
and
an
imperial
ipa
right
on
spot
with
what
i
would
consider
a
strong
ale
the
9
is
definitely
a
creeper
i
would
have
guessed
it
closer
to
7
5
if
you
blindfolded
me
16
9
ounce
bottle
the
beer
has
a
certain
heft
to
it
as
it
rests
in
my
mouth
but
is
certainly
not
heavy
it
is
a
bit
viscous
though
not
overly
sweet
it
is
quite
fruity
as
well
a
mix
between
green
grapes
raisins
a
bit
of
plum
and
a
finish
that
in
combination
with
the
alcohol
reminds
me
a
bit
of
rum
there
is
a
bit
of
hoppiness
here
though
not
much
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
character
with
a
hint
of
mint
and
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
in
the
end
the
beer
seems
a
bit
thin
in
the
finish
the
meat
of
flavors
of
this
beer
disappears
way
to
quickly
and
all
that
is
left
is
some
flabby
malt
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
which
lingers
on
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
felt
a
very
subdued
yet
very
textural
malt
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
aded
a
very
warming
sensation
to
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
taste
was
soso
i
could
not
quite
call
this
an
english
strong
seemed
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
seems
to
straddle
the
line
between
english
strong
and
imperial
ipa
mouthfeel
was
fairly
good
round
and
warming
the
finish
was
unmemorable
i
would
not
buy
another
bottle
of
this
ive
had
the
bad
elf
and
the
very
bad
elf
and
like
them
both
more
with
i
think
the
very
bad
elf
being
my
favorite
of
the
three
drinkability
is
good
enjoying
this
one
as
i
sip
it
this
is
my
third
ridgeway
holiday
brew
this
season
and
by
far
the
best
the
other
two
were
dissappointments
after
the
good
one
i
had
last
year
enjoyed
this
one
was
worried
again
after
seeing
the
score
but
going
against
the
grain
on
this
one
its
gooood
despite
the
high
abv
this
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
until
room
temperatures
warm
it
up
a
bit
too
much
at
that
point
the
alcohol
creeps
into
the
forefront
its
tough
to
say
which
between
the
two
very
bad
elf
or
seriously
bad
elf
i
liked
better
both
are
pretty
potent
and
easily
enjoyable
on
a
cold

night

a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
finger
of

that
vanishes
fast
some
slight
lacing
on
the

nose
is
a
weird
offputting
sourness
rather
strong
at
second
whiff
there
is
some
bready
malt
for
a
sort
of
sourdough
effect
but
must
too
sour
taste
is
better
a
light
butterscotch
malt
some
slight
citrus
and
green
apple
but
the
sourness
still
rears
its
head
not
nearly
as
offputting
as
the
smell
but
still
enough
to
detract
from
the
taste
slightly
bitter
grassy
hop
finish
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
low
carbonation
level
this
is
an
all
around
stinkertasted
better
when
i
held
my
nose
but
thats
not
the
way
beer
is
to
be
drunk
i
could
only
finish
half
the
bottle
before
i
poured
this
somethings
seriously
wrong
with
this
beeri
checked
other
reviews
to
see
if
i
may
have
received
a
mishandled
bottle
but
im
not
alonei
wont
be
duped
into
buying
this
again
just
based
on
the
amusing

pleasant
nor
offensive
the
beer
is
without
any
defining
flavors
odd
for
a
winter
strong
ale
no
heavy
bready
british
malt
flavor
no
estery
appley
yeast
flavors
and
no
strong
hop
profile
it
is
almost
like
a
muddy
brew
that
just
goes
down
the
hatch
not
an
offensive
brew
but
not
one
to
crow
about
i
could
be
wrong
on
those
though
a
good
holidaychristmas
beer
but
not
one
i
would
drink
too
often
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
have
had
by
this
brewery
so
far
but
that
is
not
saying
a
lot
drinkability
is
very
nice
a
very
potent
sipping
beer
perfect
for
the
cold
days
of
winter
i
will
revisit
this
one
on
cask
at
the
blind
tiger
ale
house
nyc
nice
size
head
for
a
cask
pour
hazy
orange

sharp
powerful

ale
flavor
did
not
disappoint
might
be
just
a
bit
too
tangy
though
a
nice
beer
to
have
as
a
change
of
pace
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
regularly
slick
mouth
that
is
just
below
moderate
in
feel
im
drinking
this
one
then
im
done
with
this
little
troll
i
might
buy
another
bottle
just
to
see
what
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
would
do
poured
a
nice
deep
bronze
color
with
a
thinner
white
headbig
sour
green
apple
in
the
aromas
really
hit
the
nose
with
a
band
also
picked
up
some
underlying
caramel
as
well
flavors
start
out
with
that
green
apple
elemant
up
front
but
gets
caramelly
sweet
with
brown
suger
as
late
to
the
point
that
after
awhile
it
got
somewhat
cloying
nice
flavors
dont
get
me
wrong
a
good
sipper
and
after
meal
beer
to
savor
but
it
is
quite
sweetthe
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
for
9
alc
as
well
deep
smoky
pine
and
cedar
aromas
emerge
from
the
red
liquid
this
is
booze
it
posesses
a
sweet
jawbreaker
candy
and
dried
red
fruit
jam
aroma
alongside
pepper
nuts
and
cream
very
clean
and
bittersweet
in
the
mouth
the
tannins
are
ripe
and
supple
an
absence
of
dirty
earthy
traits
balanced
with
viscous
creamy
texture
that
controls
clean
bitterness
taught
candied
fruit
and
modest
buttery
richness
this
is
something
of
a
bargain
considering
volume
price
and
quality
at
little
over
5
for
a
pint
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
in
the
neighborhood
of
my
childhood
in
lower
nyc
im
gonna
miss
this
place
but
enough
sentimentality
this
pours
semi
cloudy
medium
golden
with
an
off
white
head
not
much
lacing
noticed
nose
here
is
of
hoppy
spicy
goodness
tasty
aggresivly
hopped
british
brew
quite
dry
and
flavorful
up
front
then
more
spice
and
citrus
in
the
middle
and
finish
cant
say
this
one
is
balanced
but
for
a
brit
brew
this
one
will
please
the
hop
and
flavorful
brew
fans
worth
a
try
especially
if
yoiu
see
it
on
tap
pretty
good
actually
clear
dark
orange

bigbubbled
head
is
faintly
yellow
but
doesnt
last
long
looping
ring
laces
on
the
pint

bready

vague
off

and
oddly
sweet
orange
marmalade
low
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
less
than
medium
but
oddly
slick
gravelly
and
warbling
flavor
tone
overall
like
sweetened
black
and
green
teas
alternating
handinhand
with
orange
and
slight
spice
very
leafy
noticeable
hop
bittering
some
sense
of
alcohol
but
not
a
burning
impression
frankly
this
brew
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
its
got
some
odd
characteristics
in
combination
aroma
of
caramel
malt
buttery
faint
spice
citrus
floral
notes
biscuit
taste
sweet
malt
biscuit
toffee
slight
grassiness
pours
a
bright
orange
color
with
little
head
that
fizzes
away
pretty
clean
the
smell
was
slightly
sour
with
a
cherry
scent
to
it
the
taste
was
interesting
with
alcohol
burn
in
the
beginning
and
mellowing
out
into
sour
cherries
and
orange
peel
could
have
used
a
bit
more
balanced
but
made
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
poured
from
550
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
222014
really
not
much
going
on
with
this
one
some
decent
malt
flavors
but
overall
very
tame
and
uninteresting
overall
drinkability
its
alright
but
ive
had
much
better
strong
ales
in
fact
other
than
the
higher
abv
id
classify
this
as
a
bitter
or
an
english
pale
ale
before
id
call
it
a
strong
ale
not
good
enough
to
get
again
again
not
a
great
smell
just
okay
in
the
other
categories
but
is
strangely
drinkable
i
finished
this
off
rather
quickly
despite
the
smell
i
found
it
went
quite
well
with
food
and
maybe
that
is
what
makes
it
drinkable
good
for
washing
down
a
meal
not
good
on
its
own
so
overall
average
and
maybe
slightly
below
average
but
strangely
drinkable
go
figure
overall
man
i
am
just
inundated
with
all
the
christmas
brews
in
the
front
at
total
wine
sinister
elf
criminal
elf
neurotic
reindeer
easy
drinking
brew
a
little
more
hoppy
than
i
usually
prefer
but
a
really
nice
brew
they
do
all
seem
the
same
however
lots
o
hops
taste
like
a
christmas
tree
this
beer
cost
me
5
49
just
for
one
bottle
smells
mostly
of
semidry
toffee
malt
morning
bun
dough
and
brown
sugar
with
chopped
pecans
sprinkled
on
top
and
a
subtle
earthy
noble
hop
accent
in
the
background
tastes
of
the
same
doughytoffee
sweetness
but
doesnt
have
a
great
portion
of
the
nuts
and
hopping
strength
that
was
present
in
the
nose
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
christmas
ale
as
the
label
of
the
bottle
claims
and
not
just
another
dark
ale
as
i
could
not
really
detect
any
sort
of
holiday
spicing
element
in
particular
onothing
in
it
that
really
makes
it
seem
like
a
christmas
beer
to
me
it
is
light
enough
that
it
can
be
had
most
of
the
year
without
feeling
heavy
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
malts
bready
taste
is
malts
nutty
caramel
some
hops
a
light
bitterness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
makes
for
a
solid
offering
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
effervescence
up
front
previews
a
drying
finish
hops
holds
sway
here
especially
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
is
very
subdued
for
6
abv
a
good
solid
brew
though
i
see
nothing
to
back
up
the
christmas
ale
on
the
label
no
spices
nothing
that
typically
comes
as
a
winter
seasonal
brew
had
some
of
that
been
present
i
could
have
easily
gone
higher
in
several
areas
rjt
not
really
christsmasy
this
could
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
year
easy
drinking
and
good
looking
the
alcohol
shows
up
but
is
subtle
and
adds
dimension
appears
a
pale
copper
hue
with
a
slight
hazed
overcast
visually
pretty
appealing
forms
a
light
tan
head
with
fine
even
bands
of
lacing
aroma
is
super
fruity
with
layers
of
baked
christmas
bread
and
an
oak
barrel
aged
cherry
syrup
back
ground
note
earthy
herbal
hops
seem
to
blend
within
the
style
as
well
pretty
interesting
smelling
beer
i
like
the
concept
of
the
label
and
the
idea
of
a
reindeer
rebelling
against
christmas
and
santas
dominion
flavor
as
a
whole
is
pretty
nondescript
english
style
without
too
many
bells
and
whistles
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
syrup
like
finish
even
keeled
drinkability
not
outwardly
too
flavorful
a
nice
christmas
beer
marketing
brew
with
more
commercial
dollar
incentive
than
substinence
d
the
nice
aroma
is
rich
and
similar
to
the
the
softer
flavor
that
comes
through
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
quafting
in
the
winter
overall
an
average
strong
ale
probably
would
pass
on
future
purchase
great
label
on
the
bottle
which
is
the
highlight
of
this
beer
the
cpj
one
finger
head
receding
to
a
semi
clinging
lace
color
is
a
17
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
beer
is
slightly
cloudy
smell
of
clover
honey
malt
citrus
and
damp
wheat
taste
offers
flavors
of
nuts
nutmeg
cinnamon
raisin
citrus
peel
roasted
wheat
and
barley
mouthfeel
is
alright
but
not
great
some
creaminess
and
carbonation
but
a
little
dry
on
my
tongue
this
would
go
good
with
fish
and
rice
but
for
drinking
one
after
another
i
will
pass
strong
aroma
is
spicy
with
an
overtone
of
caramel
and
honey
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thick
and
fairly
persistent
offwhite
head
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
leaving
behind
a
nice
fizzy
and
spicy
finish
i
poured
this
awful
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
sort
of
golden
orange
color
the
beer
poured
no
head
at
all
and
it
had
a
fruity
smell
to
it
the
brew
was
bitter
with
also
a
very
sweet
hit
to
it
very
strange
brew
that
i
will
not
buy
again
as
i
think
i
know
what
was
in
this
bottle
that
came
from
the
deer
d
the
beer
isnt
difficult
to
drink
although
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
from

the
pour
is
copperorange
with
a
beige
colored
bubbly
head
yeast
caramel
malts
and
a
general
sweetness
are
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
also
pretty
sweet
with
toffee
and
butterscotch
candy
there
is
also
some
kind
of
overripe
fruit
in
the
background
with
a
slight
hopped
finish
nothing
like
what
i
would
expect
from
an
english
strong
ale
the
first
sip
is
much
more
dry
than
i
had
expected
there
is
a
light
caramel
taste
as
well
as
roasted
malt
and
heavy
biscuit
characteristics
finishes
dry
as
well
with
english
hops
the
alcohol
also
comes
out
a
bit
near
the
end
probably
more
than
it
should
considering
the
abv
while
parts
of
this
beer
are
entertaining
i
am
somewhat
disappointed
as
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
more
traditional
winter
warmer
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
tempted
to
get
it
again
anytime
soon
thick
full
body
feeling
kinda
chewy
maybe
i
should
have
a
fork
tastes
dry
bitter
burnt
chalk
with
a
very
harsh
alcohol
taste
afterwards
very
strong
pretty
average
would
probably
not
get
this
again
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
to
rave
about
but
still
enjoyable
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
milky
white
head
head
clung
to
the
side
extremely
well
aroma
was
banana
and
white
bread
and
small
amounts
of
sweetness
taste
was
slightly
hoppy
bitter
with
a
very
small
amount
of
citrus
after
flavor
felt
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
slighty
over
carbonated
slow
sipper
but
not
by
choice
just
wasnt
very
drinkable
d
not
bad
but
i
will
not
be
seeking
out
again
pours
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
faint
but
appears
to
be
mainly
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
you
also
get
some
caramel
candy
flavor
the
finish
is
somewhat
dirty
thin
body
and
highly
carbonated
not
much
of
a
beer
d
drinkability
is
a
mixed
bag
starting
out
interesting
but
again
like
their
pickled
santa
was
just
to
sweet
limiting
this
to
a
one
and
done
deal
almost
half
way
through
the
initial
offering
you
will
find
yourself
slowing
down
the
pace
and
wanting
to
check
your
bloodsugar
levels
a
pounder
is
plenty
dpretty
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
a
gimmicky
rather
bland
beer
another
average
beer
from
ridgeway
that
always
seems
to
have
those
fun
and
whimsical
offerings
every
holiday
season
i
want
to
like
these
i
really
do
but
they
always
fall
a
bit
flat
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
but
not
good
enough
to
give
it
another
try
d
easy
to
drink
but
its
a
sipper
not
one
to
have
more
than
one
bottle
of
in
a
given
session
overall
its
pretty
solid
ill
be
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
at
some
point
drinks
easy
i
could
probably
accept
this
better
as
a
bipa
or
even
a
pale
ale
reminds
me
a
bit
of
theakstons
xb
from
back
in
the
day
but
tasty
enough
better
than
expected
pour
is
on
the
side
of
orange
amber
with
a
nice
healthy
head
and
lace
a
bit
cloud
in
the
glass
nose
is
a
tad
boozy
and
citrus
there
is
a
bready
earthy
quality
that
sit
in
the
bitter
finish
and
hangs
on
the
center
of
the
tongue
dry
apple
honey
malt
finish
drinkability
its
pretty
good
but
it
is
just
a
little
too
bland
and
basic
affordable
but
i
would
probably
skip
this
one
if
i
saw
it
again
feel
is
very
english
to
it
being
the
first
enlish
strong
ale
ive
had
i
can
only
compare
it
to
other
strong
ales
ive
had
feel
is
light
carbonation
is
great
though
very
subtle
exceptional
drinkability
easy
to
drink
mass
quantities
of
this
one
the
aroma
was
a
little
subdued
but
you
got
some
hint
of
hop
smell
with
some
fruitiness
the
was
real
nice
pretty
bitter
but
was
extremely
smooth
on
the
other
hand
it
was
real
juicy
throughout
the
hop
presence
made
itself
known
at
the
end
of
the
drink
overall
it
was
a
tasty
brew
and
worth
the
price
fairly
good
d
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
i
have
no
desire
to
go
and
buy
it
again
it
does
not
stand
out
the
flavor
is
a
bland
version
of
the
aroma
apple
juice
spice
skinless
red
table
grapes
and
some
floral
notes
hops
or

idk
with

this
poured
clear
gold
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
skunked
at
first
but
that
subsided
to
a
typical
lager
smell
with
scents
of
earthy
barley
and
fresh
wheat
malts
and
lemon
and
copper
hops
as
it
warmed
the
smell
of
creamy
yeast
became
quite
noticeable
it
tasted
like
earthy
barley
and
cultured
yeast
with
some
copper
hops
and
a
bit
of
grassy
and
lemon
hops
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
unimpressive
it
definitely
seemed
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
and
there
was
nothing
christmas
about
it
it
had
a
boring
flavor
that
was
a
bit
muddled
and
a
decent
body
i
wouldnt
call
it
terrible
but
it
was
tedious
to
finish
the
glass
seasonal
obviously
but
a
lacking
overall
flavor
is
compounded
by
the
iwouldntwanttostickmynoseinthisbeerfortoolong
effect
maybe
appealing
to
an
ipa
drinker
that
doesnt
like
a
round
balanced
hop
flavor
and
a
whole
lot
more
bitterness
than
i
desire
overall
a
very
average
brew
purchased
in
a
4bottle
gift
pack
and
all
the
beers
were
about
the
same
anyways
reindeers
revolt
is
strikingly
delicious
in
my
opinion
it
poured
i
guess
a
slightly
unimpressive
golden
or
maybe
ruby
color
with
a
gorgeous
head
i
have
a
sam
adams
glass
that
i
love
to
drink
just
about
any
beer
from
that
wants
to
have
a
lot
of
head
and
a
slow
pour
this
has
great
flavor
consistent
with
most
british
strong
ales
that
ive
had
and
even
though
it
was
a
bit
pricy

for
this
bottle
i
believe
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
special
and
out
of
the
ordinary
to
enjoy
during
these
dreary
and
stressful
holiday
times

that
particularly
sticks
out
to
me
and
is
expensive
but
i
do
enjoy
this
bottle
its
getting
me
ready
for
the
fallwinter
seasonals
now
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
which
does
leave
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
then
nose
is
big
and
malty
slight
spices
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
big
on
malts
slight
spicyness
with
some
caramel
notes
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
recommended
d
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
as
a
nonspiced
holiday
brew
it
is
delicious
just
as
well
perfect
to
drink
at
a
colder
gettogether
taste
is
rather
similar
to
the
smell
malty
with
not
much
spice
rather
disappointing
considering
the
cool
label
it
is
slick
and
buttery
and
goes
down
smoothly
but
thats
the
best
part
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
smell
and
displays
little
of
the
depth
or
complexity
that
the
aroma
promises
it
is
mostly
alcholic
the
malt
thin
weak
and
onedimensionally
caramelly
the
hops
seem
slightly
acrid
bitter
hops
with
no
real
character
aside
from
of
stale
leaves
however
it
thnen
finishes
with
a
decent
light
bread
character
as
it
warms
the
acrid
quality
decreases
and
the
beer
becomes
more
smooth
but
despite
this
it
is
consistently
too
bland
and
too
alcoholic
update
i
had
this
earlier
in
the
year
and
while
i
enjoyed
its
quaffability
i
thought
it
was
too
boozy
to
be
a
really
good
ale
well
i
popped
another
bottle
towards
the
end
of
the
year
and
it
was
much
smoother
without
the
distraction
of
the
stinging
alcohol
this
was
a
grade
a
brew
i
raised
a
few
of
my
scores
and
put
this
on
my
definite
to
buy
list
cropton
rudolphs
revenge
and
ridgeway
reindeers
revolt
coincidence
or
conspiracy
they
have
similar
names
an
identical
abv
and
neither
one
stands
out
in
any
meaningful
way
as
far
as
overall
quality
the
slight
nod
goes
to
rudolph
since
this
english
strong
ale
makes
me
want
to
revolt
and
demand
better
beer
overall
not
half
bad
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
i
thought
this
was
rather
solid
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
again
but
if
i
had
no
alternative
certainly
a
good
call
not
bad

overall
just
an

d
definitely
one
of
the
better
english
beers
i
have
had
in

long
time

with
traditional

thanks
to
heather
and
alan
for
the
gift
pack
one
of
the
lower
rated
beers
from
the
ridgeway
xmas
pack
d
pretty
alcoholic
but
managable
a
light
buzz
from
the
bottle
this
is
a
good
generic
golden
ale
but
its
nothing
special
enjoyable
i
like
it
but
to
me
its
not
terribly
christmasy
but
to
be
honest
im
ok
with
that
drinkability
i
must
admit
i
came
into
this
review
a
little
jaded
having
had
two
other
christmas
beers
from
ridgeway
and
finding
them
nothing
more
than
crap
with
a
silly
label
however
i
tried
to
remain
objective
and
am
glad
i
did
this
beer
is
fairly
good
showing
some
of
what
i
would
consider
typical
indiactors
of
a
solidly
made
english
ale
i
will
have
to
remember
to
not
avoid
this
one
next
holiday
season
i
have
found
many
of
ridgeways
brews
to
be
at
the
very
least
interesting
although
theres
really
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
it
certainly
doesnt
stand
out
for
any
particular
reason
and
the
flavor
is
too
onedimensional
to
induce
ones
palate
to
a
new
experience

but
i
cant
say
i
was
anticipating
my
next
drink
of
this
either
its
not
bad
but
theres
nothing
about
it
that
would
make
me
want
to
seek
it
out
again
other
than
the
appearance
its
an

beer
not
worth
the
price
thats

good

would

a

kind

feels
like
a
english

nice

and
quite
surprised
with
the

drinkability
perfectly
acceptable
wouldnt
go
out
and
spend
another
4
on
it
but
was
glad
i
tried
it
not
really
impressed
with
this
ale
although
it
poured
a
medium
amber
and
had
a
fair
amout
of
foam
and
some
lace
it
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
the
smell
of
mild
roasted
malts
and
hops
seem
to
be
a
little
weak
the
taste
had
the
flavor
of
mild
roasted
malts
and
hops
but
the
bitter
flavor
was
there
then
gone
a
very
short
finish
with
not
a
lot
of
flavor
in
fact
the
flavor
and
everything
about
it
was
a
disapointment
not
to
buy
again

if
you
ask

another

of
the

of
an

lots
of

and
a
pleasant

this
beer
really
wore
on
me
as
i
drank
more
mildly

good

complexity
christmas
ales
typically
make
me
think
of
spices
heavy
ales
although
this
beer
is
a
solid
pure
english
pale
ale
i
was
wanting
something
with
more
christmas
character
the
beer
is
a
lightly
colored
pale
golden

with
creamy
head
formation

aromas
are
a
solid
blend
of

spiciness
maltiness

on
a

hops
are

grassy

with
a
spicy

note
the
balance
doesnt
prefer
either
but
round
eachother
out
nicely
very
clean
medium
texture
with
a
snappy
refreshing
finish
good
experience
but
there
is
nothing
that
makes
this
beer
any
more
christmas
than
any
other
good
english
ale
im
not
sure
what
an
english
xmas
ale
is
but
this
is
a
nice
british
bitter
that
is
worth
seeking
out
it
pours
a
very
clean
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
head
with
bubbles
retention
and
copious
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
malts
some
hop
bitterness
some
vague
citrus
but
overall
rather
subtle
and
insubstantial
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
decently
carbonated
and
starts
on
the
crispy
dry
side
right
after
the
pour
but
tilting
towards
a
more
mellow
sweetness
as
thing
settle
the
taste
is
a
bit
tinny
as
well
when
its
cold
although
this
dissipates
as
things
settle
down
a
bit
the
beer
has
nice
bready
malts
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
some
sweet
and
floral
tones
coming
through
in
the
middle
and
increasing
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
some
buttery
consistency
on
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
mild
yet
the
beer
feels
heavier
than
it
is
at
6
abv
worth
seeking
out
lchaim

nice

light
carbonation
and
medium

not
much
with
the

maybe
faint
malts

is
a

of

a

offwhite
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
very

theres
a

the

starts
off
boozy
with
some
toffee

some

the

it

just
seems

unfortunately
so
does
the
overall
flavor
of
this
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
syrupy
and
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
this
isnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
exactly
good
either
maybe
it
needs
more
age
on
it
who
knows
its
worth
trying
once

i
likely
wouldnt
buy
this
again
a

but
considering
the

not
bad
at
all
the
rye
malt
is
very
pleasant
and
strong
i
should
mention
that
the
bottle
i
purchased
in
december
of
2014
is
from
2010
so
maybe
this
beer
needs
some
time
to
mature
before
its
true
potential
is
reached
two
years
old
and
still
undercooked
needs
at
least
five
i
reckon
my
wife
likes
it
but
im
not
too
fond
of
the
sweetness
pours
a
bright
orange
with
an
off

the
smell
is
all
alcohol
with
only
some
light
fruit
smells
coming
through
in
the
end
the
taste
is
very
sweet
in
the
beginning
before
giving
in
to
a
lot
of
burn
from
the
booze
it
was
very
heavy

with

sorry
folks
not
my
cup

you
may
need
to
age
this
for
a
bit
too
hot
and
unrefined
for
this
2013
vintage
syrup
texture
pretty
much
kills
the
drinkability
cloying
soft
carbonation
full

bitter
earthy
finish
stays
on
with
an
alcohol
burn
overall
if
your
buying
this
novelty
brew
put
some
age
on
it
before
cracking
it
ive
seen
some
good
reviews
on
bottles
a
year
and
older
overall
a
good
special
high
abv
beer
to
enjoy
when
all
is
said
and
done
oh
ya
did
i
mention
the
holidays
are
over
oh
ya
cheers
unique
in
many
respects
it
almost
wants
to
be
sweet
but
ends
up
smooth
and
goes
down
with
a
caramel
malt
finish
with
hints
of
cognac
the
higher
abv
makes
this
one
an
attention
getter
as
in
pay
attention
or
it
will
kick
your
tail
i
really
appreciate
the
brits
giving
a
go
to
such
a
different
beer
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
upon
pouring
and
the
hops
are
left
way
in
the
background
barely
noticeable
what
does
that
say
the
aim
i
believe
for
ridgeway
was
to
create
a
good
seasonal
able
to
stand
up
to
the
holiday
beverage
lists
and
yet
smooth
enough
to
keep
ones
interest
so
insanely
bad
elf
is
not
an
everyday
but
certainly
way
above
average
for
special
occasions
deep
copper
color
with
a
1

not

aroma
has
notes
of
fruit
preserves
or
maybe
fruit
liqueur
big
malty
flavor
with
hints
of
fruity
liqueur
then
it
mellows
on
your
palette
to
a
dry
clean
hop
finish
with
noticeable
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
bodied
very
lightly
carbonated
this
beer
really
fits
an
english
barleywine
flavor
profile
more
so
than
an
english
strong
ale
whatever
the
intended
style
this
is
an
amazing
beer
m
mediumtothick
body
with
smooth
carbonation
very
drinkable
for
12
but
also
strays
toward
the
cloying
side
tone
down
the
malt
or
tone
up
the
hops
and
this
would
be
much
better
so
far
this
one
very
bad
elf
and
bad
elf
are
the
ridgeway
brews
that
i
feel
are
worthwhile
the
others
somewhat
less
so
o
this
is
a
big
beer
with
a
high
abv
and
it
is
not
very
well
hidden
this
is
definitely
a
beer
you
need
to
sip
slowly
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
due
to
the
strong
flavors
and
high
abv
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
and
it
was
a
great
deal
as
it
was
a
freebie
thrown
in
from
a
beer
store
when
purchasing
a
bunch
of
others
the
beer
pours
a
yellowgold
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grain
and
something
that
resembles
dirty
socks
not
a
nice
combination
the
flavor
is
not
any
better
there
is
some
grain
and
malt
sweetness
as
well
as
some
grass
from
the
hops
unfortunately
the
dirty
sock
quality
is
still
present
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
sweet
and
fruity
brew
with
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
which
took
the
edge
off
of
the
sweetness
overall
not
bad

best
of
the

and
a
touch
of
booze
things
seem
strangely
clashy
for
such
usually
matching
scents
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
booze
coming
through
and
clashing
a
bit
with
an
even
stronger
sweetness
than
before
its
an
overly
roasted
sweetness
at
that
just
odd
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
muddle
of
a
beer
one
that
seems
like
it
just
wants
to
be
strong
for
the
sake
of
it
like
a
pretentious
holidaythemed
british
malt
likkah
o
this
makes
me
think
of
an
english
barleywine
blended
with
a
quad
in
a
blind
tasting
i
would
have
guessed
a
poorly
executed
quad
its
parts
are
decent
but
they
do
not
work
well
together
for
some
reason
something
is
just
a
bit
off
on
this
beer
and
it
is
such
a
big
beer
that
it
is
very
noticeable
and
makes
the
beer
a
bit
undrinkable
fun
for
a
try
but
really
not
something
i
will
have
again
crystal
clear
with
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
off
white
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
lace
honey
and
pears
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
bourbon
lots
of
residual
sugars
almost
candy
like
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
only
shows
up
slightly
at
the
finish
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
vintage
2011
could
have
used
time
to
develop
insanely
bad
elf
was
an
interesting
experience
i
recommend
trying
a
single
bottle
over
picking
up
a
six
pack
overy
interesting
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavor
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
would
seek
it
out
again
a
very
good
english
strong
ale
very
enjoyable
hope
the
others
in
the
series
are
just
as
good
final
thought
i
love
this
ale
2
a
pop
and
close
to
12
percent
with
weird
crazy
and
fun
flavors
wish
i
had
a
six
note
2011
vintage
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
very
little
head
barely
any
retention
and
no
lacing
that
however
does
not
prevent
it
from
having
decent
carbonation
this
brew
smells
very
strongly
of
light
malts
theres
something
else
there
thats
a
little
more
pungent
but
its
hard
to
decipher
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
too
intricately
related
to
me
to
describe
separately
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
wave
of
carbonation
washing
over
my
tongue
which
then
dissolves
into
a
very
sweet
malty
alcohol
taste
certainly
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
but
its
interesting
o
reminds
me
a
lot
of
big
worst
and
120
minute
a
very
warming
thin
maltyfruity
winter
brew
poured
a
light
copper
with
no
noticeable
head
the
taste
of
the
alcohol
overpowered
almost
all
other
flavors
it
hits
you
in
the
nose
right
our
of
the
bottle
and
is
very
prevalent
throughout
the
drink
no
real
balance
to
speak
of
but
i
was
able
to
detect
a
little
bit
of
a
toffee
and
molasses
flavor
warming
brought
the
alcohol
out
even
more
i
expected
a
bit
of
the
bold
flavor
from
an
11
2
but
would
have
loved
to
see
this
aspect
toned
down
a
bit
to
let
some
of
the
other
flavors
shine
it
is
a
rather
sweet
tasting
beer
however
and
as
a
sipper
spread
over
an
evening
might
have
some
merit
o
might
be
too
sweet
for
some
however
for
many
this
would
be
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
winters
eve
very
tasty
but
i
cant
help
but
think
about
how
the
flavors
could
really
shine
if
the
alcohol
was
dialed
back
a
few
degrees
o
overall
it
was
very
hard
to
decide
where
i
stood
on
the
beer
i
like
the
flavor
and
color
but
it
seems
very
light
and
airy
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
would
be
on
the
rare
occasion
and
i
probably
wouldnt
stock
this
one
overall
this
is
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
but
again
though
as
your
much
better
served
by
a
sn
bigfoot
or
even
a
brooklyn
monster
after
6
sips
i
will
bury
this
one
into
the
depths
of
the
greensboro
water
treatment
plant
this
is
a
solid
d
brew
for
me
and
hoping
that
i
never
walk
this
way
again
o
to
sum
it
up
on
this
one
alcohol
candied
fruits
medium
heavy
stickiness
in
the
mouth
o
nothing
really
too
exciting
about
this
one
worth
a
try
for
something
different
if
you
dont
mind
the
booze
o
interesting
beer
but
not
for
the
weak
this
stuff
could
put
you
in
the
puzzle
factory
after
more
than
1
or
2
glad
to
try
but
a
rare
treat
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
stare
at
the
wall
laughing
overall
this
beer
is
honestly
a
hot
mess
a
pretty
high
abv
though
its
delivered
without
an
overwhelming
flavor
of
alcohol
if
it
came
cheaper
i
would
buy
more
to
sip
knowing
that
i
will
end
up
drooling
and
sitting
on
the
floor
like
the
elf
on
this
label
this
beer
pours
a
bright
amber
in
color
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
my
snifter
and
is
very
translucent
the
nose
is
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
i
initially
got
some
smoke
the
alcohol
isnt
present
at
all
but
the
aromas
themselves
are
muted
it
tastes
of
watered
down
spices
mixed
with
honey
tea
it
is
just
a
weird
mix
the
alcohol
again
isnt
present
at
all
and
im
hard
pressed
to
believe
that
this
is
really
11
2
it
drinks
light
in
body
and
is
overly
sweet
this
beer
just
isnt
worth
my
time
its
a
drain
pour
just
an
overmalted
simple
winter
warmer
o
i
would
like
to
try
another
beer
in
this
style
to
see
if
this
is
what
it
should
taste
like
something
tells
me
this
is
just
a
very
poor
representation
d
not
so
sure
this
is
worth
the
price
however
i
think
this
will
be
much
better
in
a
year
or
two
i
will
keep
a
few
bottles
of
the
2010
batch
around
and
try
to
open
one
around
christmas
2011
and
2012
dim
not
surprised
that
the
carbonation
is
scarce
since
this
is
a
3
year
old
beer
drinks
surprisingly
well
and
the
only
indication
of
the
abv
is
in
a
slight
warming
feel
in
the
throat
mouthfeeldrinkability
while
i
still
managed
to
finish
the
bottle
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wasnt
a
big
beer
drinker
i
love
all
kinds
of
beer
especially
strong
ones
but
this
beer
was
just
too
much
its
not
very
drinkable
and
its
mouthfeel
is
not
that
enjoyable
disappointed
for
the
first
time
by
ridgeway
d
cant
wait
to
have
this
next
year
d
very
sweet
but
very
drinkable
and
well
masked
on
the
alcohol
for
an
11
beer
interesting
beer
definitely
more
imperial
than
other
imperial
reds
that
i
have
had
before
the
malt
equivalent
of
a
hop
bomb
malt
massacre
big
complex
definitely
best
enjoyed
while
sipping
decent
beer
though
id
say
a
solid
b
despite
what
the
above
denotes
verdict
like
strong
ales
this
one
has
a
good
deal
of
strength
but
isnt
overwhelming
for
the
average
runofthemill
drinker
who
is
looking
for
something
different
heavy
on
the
alcohol
side
but
a
fair
balance
of
sweets
and
bitters
rounds
out
this
beer
well
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
strong
ale
for
my
first
review
give
it
a
shot
b
3

d
im
glad
i
only
picked
up
one
of
these
doesnt
meet
my
expectations
for
a
well
aged
beer
quite
the
let
down
edit
after
allowing
this
beer
to
warm
up
to
proper
ale
temperature
it
has
taken
on
a
very
boozy
character
it
is
still
good
but
this
does
affect
my
impression
of
taste
and
drinkability
negatively
a
very
nice
ale
from
ridgeway
id
buy
again
perfect
for
the
colder
weather

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
d
this
a
decent
version
of
an
englishstyle
barleywine
it
is
complex
but
not
overly
so
the
yeast
is
probably
the
most
prominent
star
here
but
the
pale
malts
are
rich
and
have
their
own
sort
of
complexity
watch
out
though
this
one
will
grab
you
quickly
egads
its
too
much
alcohol
too
much
sugar
too
much
richness
i
find
it
difficult
to
finish
2009
vintage
very
thick
in
pouring
so
head
or
any
signs
of
bubbles
to
come
at
pour
microscopic
ring
at
edge
of
glass
even
looks
syrupy
when
it
moves
in
the
glass
has
a
bright
sour
aroma
with
malt
immediately
following
and
subtle
hint
of
roasta
little
after
the
first
sweeter
malt
aroma
apple
also
in
aroma
with
warmth
alcohol
becomes
very
very
present
with
almost
a
small
roasty
note
thick
brownish
cider
color
heavy
at
start
moderate
carbonation
syrupy
feel
when
sloshing
it
around
but
doesnt
sit
as
heavy
as
i
was
expecting
mild
to
medium
dry
finish
slightly
appley
aftertaste
but
aftertaste
doesnt
have
the
alcohol
i
was
expecting
it
to
have
warmth
bring
a
metallic
taste
to
the
end
of
a
drink
more
alcohol
on
middle
and
end
and
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
to
the
beginning
did
enjoy
the
smooth
finish
and
the
ability
to
hide
the
alcohol
content
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
raisins
there
is
nothing
else
here
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
gets
to
be
really
over
barring
as
i
get
deeper
into
this
not
something
i
would
recommend
a
decent
sipping
beer
but
one
is
definitely
enough
on
a
side
note
my
wife
even
said
not
horrible
which
is
a
huge
step
up
from
most
beers
pours
a
reddishamber
with
a
thin
head
had
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
appearance
on
the
pour
thin
to
no
head
minimal
lace
smell
is
nonexistent
maybe
some
alcohol
in
there
taste
is
slapyomama
alcohol
whoa
astringent
and
bitter
but
not
a
good
hop
bitter
kinda
chemically
as
for
mouthfeel
remember
that
syrupy
pour
it
kinda
coats
your
mouth
there
are
malt
and
hops
in
there
but
the
thick
mouthfeel
and
overpowering
alcohol
make
this
red
difficult
to
drink
so
in
the
end
you
just
dont
care
about
the
rest
the
mouthfeel
is
very
slick
and
doesnt
add
any
plesure
to
the
drinking
experience
this
beer
is
a
boozy
wine
flavored
mess
and
the
only
insane
thing
about
it
is
someone
calling
it
a
good
beer
this
one
is
a
pass
and
almost
drain
pour
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
id
definitely
try
it
again
its
not
perfect
but
a
good
winter
brew
to
have
at
least
once
every
season
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beers
then
dont
bother
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
very
fruity
somewhat
sweet
taste
also
has
a
mixture
of
fruits
alcohol
is
present
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
3
5
d
not
bad
but
you
need
to
be
in
a
certain
type
of
mood
to
drink
this
beer
i
wouldnt
want
one
of
these
too
often
not
really
that
complex
in
taste
this
offers
apple
brandy
and
too
much
sugar
worth
a
try
but
not
much
else
ive
been
hearing
about
these
beers
for
a
while
and
was
glad
to
see
it
in
my
local
bottle
shop
im
not
sure
what
the
difference
is
between
an
english
strong
ale
and
and
english
ipa
but
i
liked
this
a
lot
a
lot
of
flavor
character
while
not
being
to
overwhelming
in
any
area
also
a
very
good
beer
to
mix
with
others
i
look
forward
to
getting
this
one
again
drinkability
amazing
here
alcohol
is
really
masked
maybe
the
insanity
starts
after
downing
a
few
this
brew
was
very
one
definitional
sweet
i
think
it
was
to
coy
to
drink
more
than
one
this
one
was
a
one
and
done
for
me
d
it
was
fun
to
try
but
i
didnt
finish
it
the
taste
and
moreso
the
syrupness
was
too
overwhelming
i
dont
think
i
would
try
this
one
again
nice
to
sip
but
one
is
plenty
and
preferably
shared
drinkable
for
the
style
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
unless
im
starting
a
cellar
of
christmas
ales
or
having
a
tasting
of
10
christmas
ales
it
is
pretty
straightforward
as
i
find
many
english
style
beers
to
be
mostly
it
is
sweet
alcohol
fruity
in
the
middle
with
a
sweet
finish
id
classify
this
more
as
a
barelywine
with
its
sweetness
and
abv
d
not
highly
drinkable
boozy
and
sweet
a
combo
that
doesnt
really
appeal
much
to
me
the
elf
beers
may
be
fun
stocking
stuffers
or
holiday
novelties
but
if
youre
buying
it
for
the
beer
inside
they
are
a
waste
11
2
oz
brown
bottle
poured
copper
in
color
with
a
red
hue
thin
head
as
expected
with
no
retention
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
aromas
were
sweet
caramel
and
alcohol
tastes
were
sweet
also
with
notes
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
some
spice
and
pepper
on
the
finish
alcohol
is
overly
present
here
and
takes
away
from
any
sort
of
enjoyment
that
this
extreme
ale
offers
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
bodied
and
was
actually
a
little
better
than
i
expected
after
observing
the
pour
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
and
would
not
recommend
it
okay
for
an
english
strong
ale
but
more
of
a
barleywine
a
fairly
well
put
together
beer
very
sweet
without
being
too
cloying
great
full
flavors
wouldnt
mind
just
a
touch
more
hops
to
bring
it
all
together
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
at
that
i
love
english
beers
and
i
love
big
beers
but
this
just
seems
like
a
malt
base
waiting
for
something
else
to
be
added
to
it
im
not
really
sure
why
i
keep
trying
these
ridgeway
elf
beers
their
novelty
is
just
so
attracting
but
the
taste
is
always
lacking
oh
well
its
only
a
11
2oz
still
decent
beer
very
heavy
and
thick
on
the
feel
as
expected
oh
yeah
big
body
and
sipability
is
high
its
warm
and
inviting
in
appearance
not
so
much
in
aroma
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
redeeming
this
is
definitely
in
the
old
ale
category
for
me
not
sure
how
it
could
be
listed
as
an
english
strong
ale
the
abv
alone
is
old
alebarleywine
territory
but
it
definitely
has
the
taste
of
other
oldstock
ales
ive
had
i
wasnt
expecting
much
here
but
i
was
surprised
it
has
a
unique
sweet
flavor
and
is
pretty
drinkable
overall
this
is
pretty
poor
i
suppose
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
fresh
one
but
frankly
i
cant
imagine
it
was
every
too
tasty
far
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
my
liking
d
one
and
done
drinkability
poop
this
beer
needs
an
overhaul
i
would
not
purchase
this
beer
again
strength
is
too
obvious
so
drinking
it
is
a
bit
of
a
chore
this
is
a
crappy
beer
it
isnt
terribly
offensive
but
definately
sucks
d
this
bad
boy
is
strong
the
strong
overpowering
presence
of
the
alcohol
takes
away
for
me
it
feels
like
im
drinking
a
mixed
drink
of
rum
and
beer
d
drinkability
is
not
all
that
great
average
maybe
some
of
the
complex
aromas
and
flavors
are
present
in
this
beer
that
would
make
it
a
pretty
solid
brew
but
the
11
2
is
a
real
kick
in
the
teeth
actually
it
just
comes
across
as
slightly
out
of
balance
with
a
couple
mild
changes
this
could
be
aa
very
nice
brew
or
maybe
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
would
help
too
at
this
point
though
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
drink
is
good
but
i
surely
couldnt
handle
more
than
a
few
d
very
drinkable
not
one
to
have
more
then
one
if
you
need
to
hit
the
road
afterwards
but
if
you
are
home
for
the
evening
well
i
could
be
tempted
to
having
another
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
lingers
on
top
i
get
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
some
sweet
malt
and
fruit
is
also
noted
this
beer
comes
alive
a
little
in
the
flavor
instead
of
a
hot
boozy
affair
there
is
a
solid
sweet
malt
base
with
hints
of
apricot
and
pear
a
definate
alcohol
warmth
at
the
end
solid
body
with
a
creamy
texture
low
carbonation
lets
of
flavors
soak
in
the
mouth
too
much
alcohol
for
a
regular
drink
but
a
good
beer
if
looking
for
something
with
a
kick
hopefully
ridgeway
is
finished
with
increasingly
alcoholic
variations
on
this
theme
as
far
as
im
concerned
they
peaked
with
bad
elf
and
very
bad
elf
everything
that
followed
has
been
either
abysmal
seriously
bad
and
criminally
bad
or
barely
above
average
insanely
bad
best
to
stick
with
fullers
1845
or
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
if
you
want
to
experience
big
english
ale
done
right
the
feel
is
thick
and
slippery
oily
and
slick
like
honey
very
strong
thick
sweet
and
decent
too
strong
for
repeats
but
a
good
oneoff
a
good
brew
for
a
mellow
evening
not
something
you
can
knock
back
more
than
two
during
a
sitting
pretty
nice
d
this
beer
is
well
blended
in
flavor
and
smooth
making
it
a
good
sipper
with
just
a
right
bit
of
alcohol
to
take
the
chill
of
the
winter
i
couldnt
tell
it
was
11
until
i
looked
at
the
bottle
nothing
extreme
in
this
bottle
just
a
tasty
solid
english
strong
ale
feel
and
drinkability
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
a
bit
warming
as
it
goes
down
very
nice
brew
well
crafted
and
well
drunk
the
finish
doesnt
last
that
long
whole
lot
of
nothing
after
its
swallowed
it
leaves
the
palate
feeling
empty
and
dry
there
is
very
little
if
any
flavor
that
lasts
after
it
is
swallowed
the
finish
isnt
dry
but
the
lack
of
any
lasting
flavor
gives
a
weird
sensation
that
ive
not
encountered
beforemaybe
a
swollen
tongue
but
not
swollen
because
its
parched
a
full
throat
like
all
the
muscles
are
a
bit
larger
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
it
just
makes
me
want
to
take
another
drink
this
is
one
that
ill
most
definitely
buy
again
a
great
beer
give
it
a
shot
notes
this
brew
was
just
a
little
unbalanced
in
the
finish
nothing
to
get
crazy
aboutyet
this
beer
to
me
felt
like
a
strong
ale
and
nothing
else
perhaps
not
the
greatest
english
strong
alebut
a
good
one
the
finish
could
have
been
better
though
and
that
may
have
hurt
the
rating
it
just
tasted
out
of
order
towards
the
end
and
the
solvent
taste
of
the
alcohol
made
this
one
a
slow
sipper
in
the
final
moments
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
again
if
i
have
to
spend
7
but
i
enjoyed
it
it
reminded
me
of
the
same
brewerys
beer
lump
of
coal
stay
away
from
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
sweet
pours
a
clear
amber
color
15
inch
head
with
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
sweet
of
rye
and
some
muted
grass
aromas
fits
the
style
of
an
english
strong
ale
i
guess
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
low
carbonation
level
present
tastes
very
tart
up
front
then
the
alcohol
comes
through
strongly
slight
hop
bitterness
is
noticeable
and
some
sweetness
from
caramel
maybe
is
present
once
your
past
the
alcohol
and
tartness
the
beer
is
pretty
good
the
sweetness
is
balanced
by
the
hop
bitterness
for
a
good
finish
overall
its
just
too
hard
to
get
past
the
initial
flavors
to
its
credit
the
beers
tartness
does
wane
as
you
progress
and
increases
its
quality
of
taste
the
nose
of
the
beer
is
fruity
with
some
esters
rolling
up
you
also
get
some
solvent
like
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
and
of
caramel
it
has
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
the
high
alcohol
volume
is
smoothed
out
by
the
sweetness
overall
for
the
what
the
beer
is
not
too
bad
consumed
on

this
beer
is
insanely
bad
so
bad
in
fact
that
after
joining
ba
almost
a
year
ago
without
any
motivation
for
reviewing
it
motivated
me
to
start
simply
to
warn
my
fellow
beer
connoisseurs
i
almost
grabbed
the
barleywine
from
this
series
and
i
wish
i
had
instead
of
this
one
because
i
doubt
it
could
be
worse
than
this
ill
be
the
first
to
say
to
each
his
own
and
there
are
plenty
of
things
i
do
contrary
to
popular
opinion
on
this
site
ie
aging
maharaja
but
in
my
personal
opinion
this
beer
is
simply
really
bad
the
appearance
is
dark
brownred
with
virtually
no
head
the
smell
is
nothing
particularly
unique
rich
in
malt
and
alcohol
but
the
taste
is
simple
flat
and
completely
unimaginative
ill
admit
the
alcohol
burn
was
very
slight
which
is
pretty
impressive
for
something
this
big
but
the
complete
and
utter
lack
of
carbonation
which
i
didnt
even
think
i
would
care
about
and
the
foul
aftertaste
of
stale
beer
are
quite
enough
to
motivate
me
to
write
this
review
i
truly
hope
this
is
helpful
and
while
i
have
not
tried
the
other
beers
from
this
brewer
im
willing
to
bet
that
they
are
better
than
this
moral
of
the
story
get
the
barleywine
d
i
did
not
like
this
i
actually
did
not
drink
it
all
the
way
through
will
not
look
this
direction
again
dont
really
like
this
one
that
much
the
fruity
taste
just
clashes
with
the
melon
and
bitterness
pours
a
clear
appealing
reddishamber
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
aroma
is
strong
and
more
fruity
than
malty
like
a
strong
cider
or
brandy
flavor
is
surprisingly
sweet
but
not
cloying
fruity
mainly
apple
and
lacking
the
kind
of
alcohol
bite
i
expected
from
such
a
highgravity
beer
texture
is
tingly
and
lively
and
it
leaves
a
pleasingly
sweet
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
bitterness
if
youre
looking
for
any
sort
of
hops
get
another
beer
if
your
looking
for
something
more
akin
to
brandy
or
sherry
this
would
be
a
nice
yearly
treat
winter
beer
yes
it
warms
yes
but
not
too
pleasantly
it
poured
in
to
my
glass
a
hazy
brown
color
and
then
turned
a
beautiful
shade
of
dark
red
the
head
and
bubbles
started
from
the
middle
and
worked
their
way
to
the
top
before
settling
the
head
went
fast
but
formed
a
nice
tight
lace
it
has
a
sweet
candy
and
malt
aroma
with
some
fruity
esters
the
taste
is
almost
all
malt
there
is
virtually
no
bitter
flavor
to
this
beer
at
all
it
has
a
slick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
there
is
some
fizz
in
the
feel
but
i
would
not
call
it
bite
i
like
it
it
is
incredibly
smooth
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
edit
i
let
my
wife
have
a
sip
her
reaction
was
that
of
a
cat
that
just
ate
the
most
terrible
thing
ever
followed
by
who
killed
a
bison
an
threw
it
in
a
beer
priceless
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
minimal
head
smell
is
malty
and
slightly
fruity
taste
is
sweet
but
the
alcohol
presnece
is
a
bit
too
harsh
mouthfeel
is
viscuous
and
dry
due
to
alcohol
drinkability
is
ok
after
all
it
is
a
sipper
but
ive
had
smoother
even
with
high
abvs
overall
the
beer
is
syrupy
and
overall
sweet
the
mouth
feel
is
warming
from
the
alcohol
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
the
beer
is
very
strong
and
solvent
like
the
beer
is
not
to
bad
and
very
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
i
think
i
would
like
the
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
syrupy
the
finish
does
linger
on
the
palate
for
a
little
bit
i
would
like
the
beer
to
be
more
refined
and
not
so
syrupy
i
like
the
beer
although
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
orange
absent
any
head
and
lacing
has
a
strong
smell
of
fruit
and
i
think
maple
a
bit
thin
and
a
strong
aftertaste
of
sweet
and
alcohol
a
decent
beer
to
try
once
in
a
while
but
not
one
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
or
likley
to
drop
5
on
a
bottle
of
again
a
good
brew
for
holiday
sipping
by
a
fire
and
sharing
family
stories
d
on
the
whole
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
pretty
well
made
but
didnt
blow
me
away
would
try
it
again
and
recommend
if
you
like
english
strong
ales
hv
d
at
almost
12
one
warmed
me
up
rather
nicely
but
i
could
muster
four
or
five
if
a
celebration
was
in
order
if
you
like
sweet
and
alcoholic
thin
feeling
beers
this
is
up
your
alley
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
and
the
alcohol
is
very
evident
think
fruit
punch
with
everclear
and
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
really
didnt
like
this
one
d
this
comes
across
just
too
sweet
and
boozy
to
rank
much
higher
on
the
drinkability
scale
it
was
worth
a
try
one
but
i
dont
think
ill
need
another
d
maybe
a
little
on
the
toosweet
side
for
my
taste
d
very
sweet
and
syurpy
definatly
a
slow
sipper
very
interesting
taste
that
would
make
me
have
again
good
on
a
cold
night
but
not
an
every
day
drinker
cheers
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
the
insanely
bad
elf
and
im
going
to
go
pick
up
another
few
bottles
for
the
holidays
it
is
kind
of
pricey
im
not
sure
id
have
two
in
a
row
but
i
might
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
enough
that
id
consider
doing
so
that
said
for
me
the
drinkability
was
high
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
love
to
nip
at
while
reading
before
bed
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
is
alright
unless
youre
looking
for
cool
bottles
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
bottle
at
the
bayou
pours
a
very
nice
bright
red
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
the
nose
is
very
nice
sweet
caramel
candies
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
the
flavor
was
also
quite
nice
sweet
candies
dark
and
sweet
candies
cherries
and
more
sugars
more
of
a
aperitif
but
still
enjoyable
went
down
pretty
easy
for
11
2
good
drinkability
one
for
me
thank
you
certainly
a
strong
offering
and
i
can
see
this
as
a
good
christmastime
by
the
fire
beer
but
it
lacks
any
wow
factor
poured
a
tawny
gold
with
a
little
offwhite
head
from
a
hard
pour
aroma
of
toffee
aldehyde
apple
and
spirit
complex
sweet
flavor
like
toasted
toffee
rich
and
sweet
but
with
just
enough
carbonation
and
drying
alcohol
to
keep
it
not
so
much
balanced
but
just
far
enough
away
from
listing
to
the
malt
side
and
capsizing
nicely
complex
caramelized
and
aged
sugar
flavors
to
keep
it
interesting
there
might
have
been
some
hops
in
there
to
aid
the
balance
but
they
play
a
very
minor
role
id
definitely
drop
this
one
into
the
barleywine
category
for
an
11
abv
beer
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
that
does
not
say
its
anywhere
near
sessionable
nor
would
that
be
particularly
wise
amber
color
with
a
very
small
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
light
with
sweet
malts
and
fruity
hops
the
taste
is
much
fuller
lots
of
residual
sugars
along
with
mellow
hops
and
fruity
malts
medium
body
drink
easily
i
think
ridgeway
tries
to
replicate
hardys
and
jw
but
falls
short
they
are
just
not
quite
there
taste
has
a
slight
metallic
quality
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
and
lots
of
sweetness
slight
bitterness
combined
with
a
warming
alcohol
presense
cuts
through
it
a
bit
but
it
stays
sweet
in
the
finish
a
lingering
sweetness
really
quite
smooth
id
say
its
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
red
not
dry
or
hoppy
like
most
american
red
ales
but
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
its
fun
to
try
to
decipher
it
all
good
malty
body
interesting
spices
good
fruit
definitely
original
overall
smooth
but
it
could
still
use
a
bit
more
time
for
the
sugars
to
die
down
but
i
would
drink
another
in
a
flash
3
99
for
11
2abv
and
i
look
forward
to
putting
a
few
away
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
rich
and
creamy
smooth
light
effervescence
fullbodied
warms
mouth
and
throat
an
amazingly
good
beer
d
probably
after
a
meal
by
the
fire
on
a
cool
evening
would
never
buy
this
again
nor
serve
it
with
food
it
would
work
with
cigars
however
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
really
quite
different
from
the
rest
of
the
lineup
and
that
was
really
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
really
a
top
notch
beer
that
is
worth
every
penny
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
ales
the
color
was
a
reddish
mahogany
color
with
no
foam
and
not
a
drop
of
lace
but
the
roasted
malty
caramel
flavor
made
up
for
it
along
with
a
hint
of
sour
apple
and
just
a
well
balanced
strong
ale
it
didnt
have
that
alcohol
bite
even
with
the
11
plus
percent
alcohol
content
expesensive
but
well
worth
the
price
its
drinkable
if
you
like
your
beers
sweet
and
alcoholic
if
you
like
a
more
hoppy
and
balanced
beer
then
look
elsewhere
d
i
really
liked
this
one
and
would
drink
it
again
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
golden
orangeamber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
litte
fizzy
offwhite
head
which
does
leave
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
very
nice
malty
some
dark
fruits
especially
cherries
slight
spices
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
sour
cherries
and
some
caramel
medium
body
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
for
a
brew
this
high
in
abv
very
well
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
recommended
for
sure
pours
a
mahogany
with
very
little
head
earthy
aroma
very
little
hop
definite
alcohol
effect
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
carbonic
bite
and
alcohol
nice
smooth
and
round
mouthfeel
drinkable
for
this
level
of
alcohol
reminds
me
a
bit
of
dfh
120
minute
good
but
not
exceptional
another
ridgeway
beer
that
triumphs
through
marketing
rather
than
taste
d
kind
of
like
thomas
hardys
but
with
more
sweet
malts
definitely
an
interesting
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
worth
trying
d
hands
down
the
best
of
the
elf
series
but
still
not
something
that
id
recommend
i
have
mixed
feelings
on
this
the
flavor
profile
and
the
complexity
of
it
is
pretty
interesting
but
the
alcohol
burn
thats
the
third
time
ive
mentioned
it
is
overpowering
and
worrisome
but
he
fact
that
i
have
written
this
much
means
that
generally
i
like
it
good
stuff
drinkability
this
sipping
ale
is
so
big
and
flavorful
that
it
might
even
be
too
much
for
the
novice
the
biggest
esa
ive
had
to
date
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
some
syrupy
texture
and
very
mild
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
brings
out
some
red
vinous
grape
mixing
with
brown
sugar
and
general
sweetness
the
sweetness
is
almost
too
much
and
i
am
glad
to
have
split
the
bottle
some
boozy
peppery
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
sweetness
and
booziness
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
overall
a
nice
winter
brew
drinkability
a
most
enjoyable
sipper
but
the
abv
is
too
high
and
overtakes
the
beer
instead
of
enhancing
it
id
rather
have
more
beer
flavor
less
hootch
too

with
notes

a
very
nice
malt
sweetness
with
significant
licorice
liquor
character
very
sweet
but
not

aftertaste
is
pleasant
sweetness
but
balanced
by
the
dryness
of
the
alcohol
by
far
the
best
of
the
elf
series
looks
medium
brown
from
the
top
f
the
beer
when
held
to
the
light
it
looks
like
a
syrupy
amber
with
a
little
ruby
mixed
in
loomkssort
of
a
barley
wine
the
aroma
has
lots
of
dark
deep
fruits
figs
brown
sugar
and
plums
the
first
sip
gives
off
notes
of
plums
prunes
and
frozen
grapes
lots
of
carmelized
malts
and
sweet
syrup
the
alcohol
intgrates
very
well
with
the
sweet
flavors
in
this
beer
a
little
nutty
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
very
smooth
warmth
great
sipping
beer
d
not
very
much
it
was
5
99
and
i
would
maybe
have
2
but
thats
it
i
would
rather
find
another
beer
for
that
price
this
beer
needed
carbonation
and
some
balance
to
it
for
a
very
high
abv
this
is
smooth
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
at
a
fast
clip
its
impressive
delicious
and
a
bit
dangerous
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
character
yet
this
is
still
very
tasty
and
well
worth
buying
d
good
drinkablility
for
11
2
but
the
sweetness
can
become
cloying
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
very
good
very
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
big
beer
might
have
to
stash
a
couple
of
these
in
the
cellar
i
could
personally
use
the
alcohol
dialed
down
a
few
notches
and
the
hops
upped
just
for
good
measure
to
even
out
this
strong
brew
a
little
bit
more
not
bad
not
great
good
brew
but
too
intensely
sweet
and
cloying
to
drink
more
than
one
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
i
could
see
sucking
back
a
few
by
the
fire
or
with
my
dessert
or
cheese
course
solid
english
strong
ale
imperial
red
ale
pours
an
amberorange
color
and
has
sweet
notes
of
malt
with
including
prune
raisin
molasses
an
almost
barleywine
flavor
which
is
unexpected
when
the
color
is
considered
some
hoppy
bitterness
towards
the
end
but
is
smooth
going
down
not
a
session
brew
and
a
little
disappointing
after
the
seriously
bad
elf
experience
which
i
found
enjoyable
not
a
typical
english
brew
in
my
experience
a
bit
too
pricey
for
the
quality
but
good
for
a
quick
strong
buzz
without
a
wine
or
harder
beverage
and
easily
drinkable
considering
the
11
2
great
label
near
fullbodied
and
syrupy
this
is
strong
stuff
im
not
complaining
about
the
strength
but
would
like
more
balance
and
depth
to
accompany
it
gimmicky
not
a
fan
of
this
one
this
beer
really
surprised
me
great
quality
flavors
are
unified
with
no
harshness
at
all
the
alcohol
is
amazingly
well
hidden
making
this
one
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
winner
i
guess
i
have
to
go
insane
to
enjoy
the
bad
elf
series
i
beleive
this
one
to
be
the
best
by
far
of
the
series
pours
ruby
red
and
tranparent
with
a
decent
head
the
nose
does
have
the
ridgeway
funk
but
its
not
as
prominent
you
can
actually
taste
things
in
this
one
it
is
quite
a
bit
nuttier
than
the
other
elves
strong
nut
flavors
and
i
can
actually
taste
some
hops
on
the
finish
in
this
one
sugary
residue
on
the
lips
isnt
as
rotten
as
the
other
elves
a
decent
brew
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
keep
one
in
my
cellar
notes
once
again
with
ridgeway
in
my
opinion
for
the
price
per
value
scale
this
falls
short
it
has
a
barleywine
feel
to
it
mixed
with
a
belgian
fruity
profile
in
a
nutshell
im
slowly
but
surely
souring
on
the
whole
import
portfolio
there
is
just
too
much
good
beer
out
our
backdoors
now
average
very
clean
and
if
it
werent
so
darn
warm
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
however
with
the
5
50
cost
per
bottle
i
would
rather
spend
my
money
elsewhere
for
mass
quantities
this
is
the
last
of
the
naughty
elf
brews
on
me
list
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
faint
almost
nonexistant
perhaps
a
very
light
caramel
malt
scent
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
big
sweet
caramelhoney
blast
it
is
followed
by
some
nutty
and
wine
like
flavors
the
feel
is
moderate
with
light
carbonation
finishes
slick
almost
like
a
dessert
liquor
you
can
sense
the
alcohol
but
the
11
2
doesnt
burn
the
buds
the
finish
feels
like
you
have
just
had
about
5
lollipops
so
needless
to
say
the
sweetness
can
be
cloying
an
average
brew
and
worth
a
go
to
get
the
bottle
into
my
collection
i
must
say
the
very
bad
elf
has
been
my
favorite
the
beer
departs
the
330ml
bottle
a
crystalline
golden
amber
with
a
smallish
creamy
white
head
that
erodes
quickly
leaving
a
thin
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
malt
sweet
aroma
a
bit
of
alcohol
also
present
a
tad
bit
of
hops
spicy
and
earthy
crisp
and
pleasant
start
is
sweet
with
a
nice
malt
profile
alcohol
bitter
at
the
back
with
a
medium
feel
finish
has
a
stern
acidity
the
hops
present
but
overpowered
by
the
11
20
abv
dry
sweet
aftertaste
and
a
definite
tummy
warmer
this
one
and
a
real
hoot
drinkability
the
over
11
abv
is
very
well
hidden
drink
this
at
room
temp
and
let
it
decant
for
a
good
30
minutes
overall
its
a
very
good
brew
and
would
have
it
again
although
its
4
99
price
tag
was
too
steep
for
what
you
get
how
about
3
and
you
bot
yourself
a
deal
body
is
smooth
and
full
not
too
dense
and
not
too
foamy
this
is
a
complex
yet
approachable
beer
and
certainly
a
pleasure
to
drink
possibly
my
favorite
of
the
holiday
elf
series
overall
delicious
full
warm
sweet
english
style
barleywine
with
a
strong
sweetness
very
very
nice
and
something
id
absolutely
buy
again
even
at
a
very
high
price
per
bottle
nice
mouthfeel
this
one
works
as
an
imperial
red
as
advertised
too
sweet
and
sugary
to
pass
as
an
american
strong
ale
way
too
much
syrup
to
pass
as
an
english
strong
ale
pours
a
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
plum
and
a
small
sweet
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
again
plum
yet
dry
and
a
bigger
alcohol
presence
a
smooth
malty
alcohol
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
darkk
fruit
alcohol
aftertaste
big
in
alcohol
and
quite
plummish
thank
god
for
a
12oz
not
a
half
liter
like
the
rest
i
was
prepared
for
the
worst
after
reading
the
first
few
reviews
below
mine
but
in
my
opinion
it
turned
out
to
taste
pretty
good
smells
of
alcohol
toasted
nuts
and
maple
syrup
the
alcohol
is
quite
wellmasked
in
the
taste
which
is
itself
sweet
and
smooth
not
that
complex
but
the
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
and
theres
enough
carbonation
to
take
the
edge
off
the
boozy
maltiness
the
taste
improves
as
it
warms
oh
yeah
and
you
get
another
xmas
themed
bottle
with
a
disturbed
looking
elf
in
a
straightjacket
awesome
personal
score
58100
d
good
marketing
that
is
pushing
a
beer
that
is
difficult
to
tolerate
even
as
a
sipper
and
never
more
than
one
in
a
holiday
season
it
is
insanely
bad
id
almost
prefer
a
health
dose
of
cough
syrup
another
in
the
line
of
elf
brews
from
ridgeway
poured
into
a
snifter
a
orange
infused
copper
with
a
well
formed
one

head
that
is
gone
quickly
leaving
no
lace
as
it
settled
quicklybig
english
malt
aromas
very
cakey
with
alcohol
infused
dark

of
buttery
caramel
and
a
whiff
of
leafy
hop
lingers
a
great
cold
evening
sipping
brew
it
warms
the
inside
with
somewhat
sweet
malt
profileit
starts
out
with
that
dark
fruit
element
like
raisins
and
prunes
in
a
holiday
cake
a
hint
of
vanillalike
rum
as
well
all
overtop
of
a
caramel
base
light
bittering
keeps
it
from
becoming
overly
cloying
a
great
seasonal
sipper
it
will
likely
help
put
me
to
bed
pretty
early
tonight
the
latest
in
the
bad
elf
series
and
likely
the
best
the
previous
elfs
became
more
cluttered
and
rough
as
the
alcohol
increased
and
the
flavors
intensified
but
this
one
is
different
a
sweet
bready
toasty
aroma
shows
no
hint
of
higher
alcohols
or
abrasion
flavors
are
malty
sweet
but
the
toasty
character
keeps
the
beer
from
cloying
sweetness
hopped
for
a
bitter
balance
and
little
sweetness
but
never
competes
with
the
complex
malt
profile
as
the
beer
warms
a
sweet
rumlike
alcohols
adds
to
the
mix
in
favorable
light
well
melded

complement
the
heavy

well
never
fusal
phenolic
and
moderately
estery
smoothly
textured
but
not
without
strong

textures
and
alcohol
warming
finishes
toastysweet
and
warm
a
very
good
beer
despite
the
intimidating
namesake
this
is
very
interesting
reminds
me
of
an
eisbock
definitely
a
good
beer
yet
not
outstanding
perhaps
a
year
or
more
of
age
will
be
very
kind
to
this
beer
and
it
will
show
its
grand
potential
ill
be
checking
back
to
visit
this
one
next
winter
guaranteed
i
hope
to
see
this
every
year
probably
the
best
of
the
elf
series
to
date
overall
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favourite
english
beers
it
ticks
all
the
right
boxes
nicely
complex
great
feel
great
package
great
aroma
easy
drinking
and
can
be
a
slowsipper
if
you
want
a
decent
price
too
for
a
topend
brit
at
au8
definitely
worth
the
having
copper
colour
with
no
head
theree
seems
to
be
dried
fruit
apple
lemon
and
sherbet
in
the
nose
this
is
certainly
on
the
citric
side
for
an
english
strong
ale
but
there
is
a
pleasant
variety
of
discernible
flavours
aside
from
lemon
including
vanilla
oak
brown
sugar
and
a
little
mint
good
stuff
pours
a
dark
copper
hue
with
a
off
white
two
finger

and
very
nice

still

the

with

and
overall
i
like
it
and
the
perfect
after
dinner
drop
and
would
buy
again
as
would
age
well
cheers
an
excellent
beer
with
tonnes
going
on
and
a
beer
that
strikes
a
great
balance
between
the
rich
malty
flavours
and
the
sweet
dark
fruit
like
ones
the
caramel
that
both
the
aroma
and
taste
start
with
are
a
lot
stronger
than
i
would
have
expected
but
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
in
the
near
future
o
its
a
good
beer
but
far
from
outstanding
while
i
might
still
get
this
beer
every
now
and
then
i
could
live
my
life
without
ever
having
this
again
a
good
beer
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
something
easy
but
with
character
o
not
overly
complex
but
perfect
tasting
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
ive
ever
had
absolutely
beautiful
o
nice
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
strong
ale
but
still
nice
actually
too
boozy
and
sweet
lacks
freshness
pretty
one
dimensional
meh
i
had
expected
a
heavier
and
sweeter
brew
but
i
got
a
tremendously
drinkable
and
quite
hoppy
one
will
probably
gain
some
complexity
over
the
next
years
overall
great
texture
and
complex
taste
keeps
you
guessing
at
what
the
flavour
is
which
is
exciting
a
really
really
good
tasty
ale
o
a
rich
complex
full
flavoured
beer
best
sipped
and
savoured
nice
a
quaffable
strong
ale
subtle
and
sweet
a
good
sipping
ale
that
suits
winter
more
than
summer
the
reduced
score
for
appearance
was
due
to
the
excess
of
floating
yeast
i
like
this
one
and
commend
it
to
all
who
encounter
it
pours
mahogany
with
a
bubbly
cream
coloured
head
translucent
body
with
moderate
head
retention
and
good
lacing
nose
is
bready
alcohol
sweet
and
mildly
acidic
grape
skins
a
very
fine
and
extremely
mild
acetic
note
and
caramel
overriding
most
of
this
notable
english
character
in
the
mild
hopping
and
malt
taste
is
interesting
again
an
english
caramel
and
bready
quality
with
some
slightly
sharp
alcoholic
notes
a
fine
hint
of
balsamic
vinegar
some
pear
and
a
general
fruitiness
berries
and
some
other
dark
fruits
touch
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
medium
high
carbonation
alcoholic
for
the
most
part
however
interesting
yet
quite
confusing
as
to
what
i
should
be
rating
this
as
foreign
to
almost
anything
ive
tried
pleasant
to
try
doubtful
that
id
revisit
overall
i
would
not
seek
out
this
beer
again
but
am
happy
to
drink
the
bottle
that
i
have
i
knew
going
into
it
that
this
was
not
a
belgian
tripel
but
i
wish
it
had
been
bought
2
bottles
reviewed
the
first
march
2011
half
litre
bottle
dark
ruby
mahogany
colour
clear
the
head
goes
fairly
quickly
the
malts
dominate
the
smell
but
some
sour
pear
comes
out
as
well
the
7
2
percent
comes
through
strongly
its
too
much
it
dominates
i
got
a
bit
of
smoke
with
some
apple
this
isnt
a
smooth
beer
not
easy
to
drink
have
to
say
i
expected
a
bit
more
second
bottle
reviewed
one
year
later
aging
the
beer
really
worked
it
had
a
nice
fruity
aroma
a
much
smoother
texture
and
the
alcohol
was
so
well
hidden
this
is
definately
a
beer
to
age
before
drinking
nose
is
exceptionally
floral
and
fruity
loads
of
green
apples
and
flowers
hints
of
honey
and
caramel
malt
flavor
is
clean
and
approachable
while
not
altogether
noteworthy
middling
sweet
pleasant
hints
of
bread
and
honey
light
cocoa
caramel
quite
a
bit
of
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
which
provides
a
really
grassy
dry
finish
extremely
light
body
for
the
abv
which
is
hidden
nowhere
to
be
found
except
in
your
head
as
the
bottle
progresses
drinkable
and
pleasant
could
use
a
little
more
complexity
but
for
what
it
is
its
a
pleasant
beer
why
has
it
got
a
bee
on
it
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
thin
creamy
white
head
that
settles
at
the
edges
with
slight
lacing
showing
up
smells
malty
with
caramel
toffee
slight
lemon
zest
with
hops
revealing
themselves
toward
the
end
tastes
malty
with
caramel
sweet
candy
like
notes
noticeable
alcohol
with
a
medium
bitterness
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
medium
to
thin
mouthfeel
that
was
watery
at
times
good
light
carbonation
though
this
is
above
average
but
thats
it
i
feel
like
this
would
be
good
on
tap
as
opposed
to
bottle
i
would
have
it
again
but
not
for
some
time
though
the
alcohol
is
also
hitting
me
really
hard
im
gonna
go
high
on
this
even
though
im
not
sure
exactly
what
i
am
tasting
it
is
very
flavorful
and
compelling
but
has
some
mystery
to
it
that
i
cant
quite
grasp
very
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
one
ill
definitely
seek
out
a
few
more
bottles
could
do
with
being
a
bit
more
supple
but
still
tastes
pretty
good
to
me
drink
the
beer
really
had
a
fantastic
appearance
not
sure
ive
ever
seen
so
much
lacing
the
taste
reminded
me
of
an
esb
with
a
higher
level
of
alcohol
its
an
above
average
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
very
interesting
beverage
smooths
out
after
repeated
sips
though
you
still
end
up
feeling
the
booze
d
this
is
a
top
quality
english
strong
ale
drinkability
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
from
the
appearance
to
the
tasting
this
was
a
full
package
beer
something
i
would
seek
out
and
have
on
hand
it
pours
nice
and
serves
well
d
oustanding
ale
here
and
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
bought
this
while
on
a
recent
trip
to
toronto
and
will
have
to
see
if
i
can
get
this
locally
in
chicago
the
mouthfeel
is
gently
carbonated
and
not
overly
creamy
or
thick
it
glides
easily
over
your
palate
and
has
just
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
you
the
whole
way
overall
it
is
a
nice
round
medium
body
with
a
smoothly
rich
palate
the
finish
is
sweet
with
a
short
hint
of
bitter
hops
this
would
be
a
nice
accompaniment
to
roast
game
dishes
or
rich
cheeses
but
really
i
think
it
was
built
to
stand
on
its
own
500ml
bottle
from
the
lcbo
poured
into
a
goblet
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
ring
of
cream
white
head
smell
and
taste
are
cherry
bubblegum
toffee
rich
malts
barley
red
plums
dark
fruit
sweetness
fig
christmas
cake
butterscotch
citrus
hop
bitterness
quite
spicy
and
astringent
warming
alcohol
to
end
fuller
than
medium
palate
coats
the
mouth
with
foamy
citric
and
drying
textures
an
unusually
hoppy
english
strong
which
isnt
surprising
given
the
generous
use
of
cascade
hops
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
the
style
can
be
but
still
an
outstanding
sipper
this
will
now
be
a
regular
purchase
for
me
i
cant
see
asking
anything
more
from
an
english
strong
ale
many
british
brewers
operate
on
illusions
of
grandeur
but
few
actually
create
the
succulent
refined
ales
they
boast
to
brakspear
triple
along
with
fullers
vintage
ale
1845
and
greene
king
strong
suffolk
are
the
beers
that
truly
define
what
it
means
to
drink
to
the
fullest
extent
not
a
bad
little
strong
ale
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
isnt
masked
perfectly
but
the
corresponding
flavors
certainly
get
the
job
done
a
bit
strong
for
a
session
but
it
works
as
a
good
finish
to
a
long
day
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
colour
with
thick
offwhite
head
tons
of
lacing
has
a
sweet
roasted
fruit
smell
taste
has
a
lot
of
banana
and
raisin
with
some
sort
of
spices
little
bit
of
hop
presence
too
very
smooth
carbonation
level
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
moderately
strong
beer
im
glad
i
randomly
picked
this
up
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
strong
ale
d
very
sippable
and
pleasant
but
perhaps
too
big
and
complex
to
be
enjoyed
for
a
lengthy
stretch
notes
not
like
a
belgian
tripel
and
quite
british
in
flavor
also
vaguely
reminds
me
of
a
euro
strong
lager
lots
of
apple
and
some
alcohol
pretty
dominate
resulting
in
a
tangy
tasting
beer
overall
definitively
not
a
typical
belgiumstylelike
tripel
more
a
boozy
ale
not
bad
to
try
once
but
a
too
flat
and
too
boring
drinkability
is
alright
but
would
not
want
more
than
a
bottle
coffee
brown
mahogany
along
the
edges
with
a
yellowed
ivory
head
not
very
good
retention
for
a
bottleconditioned
ale
nose
is
mostly
cola
with
a
good
smack
of
citrus
especially
lime
and
grapefruit
intersected
by
grape
and
pearlike
fruitiness
and
unusual
notes
of
dark
honey
varnish
and
fresh
pineapple
tastes
rather
sweet
and
surprisingly
bland
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
quiet
fruity
and
spicy
notes
a
surge
of
whiskeylike
alcohol
fires
up
the
finish
which
along
with
a
consistently
hoppy
bitter
orange
flavor
and
a
light
airy
dry
body
helps
to
add
balance
not
bad
but
not
very
interesting
way
too
bland
to
warrant
the
strength
d
even
though
this
is
relatively
high
alcohol
beer
it
is
not
overbearing
in
any
way
from
the
alcohol
the
hops
or
the
malt
everything
about
this
beer
is
balanced
if
slightly
pronounced
i
could
enjoy
this
all
night
long
this
was
a
lucky
find
for
me
old
leather
armchairs
gentlemens
clubs
and
money
that
is
what
this
beer
reminds
me
of
i
can
imagine
warm
lounges
smoking
jackets
and
cigars
when
drinking
this
a
very
good
beer
the
7
2
is
well
hidden
and
balanced
nicely
a
beer
for
people
who
like
the
better
things
in
life
3
m3
d
even
smoother
than
the
last
bottle
yet
the
texture
turns
a
bit
thin
at
the
tail
of
each
sip
while
the
body
is
not
yet
threedimensional
it
seems
ageing
hasnt
done
a
great
deal
to
improve
its
overall
complexity
and
especially
the
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
for
my
taste
palate
is
hot
stinging
generally
fruity
and
sweet
finish
is
even
hotter
with
some
yeasty
bitterness
and
lots
of
alcohol
not
bad
but

a
dark
gold
with
just
a
couple
of
floaties
from
swishing
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
solid
malty
aroma
solid
malty
flavour
as
well
but
with
a
slight
bit
of
tangy
fruitiness
as
well
however
the
aftertaste
is
all
malt
which
isnt
quite
my
thing
rerate
in
april
08
man
its
going
down
nicely
still
malty
but
seemingly
richer
and
satisfying
an
itch
as
it
goes
down
the
throat
upped
the
ratings
a
bit
i
would
probably
want
this
in
a
330ml
bottle
as
well
as
after
finishing
the
500ml
the
alcohol
was
very
apparent
bottle
conditioned
from
the
lcbo
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
which
diminishes
to
a
fine
film
really
fresh
aroma
apples
oranges
and
pine
needles
the
taste
has
a
nice
apple
edge
to
the
malt
body
but
i
can
also
detect
the
presence
of
darker
fruits
as
well
as
caramel
and
nut
the
finish
is
refreshingly
bitter
with
a
slight
warmth
from
wellhidden
alcohol
excellent
beer
that
seems
to
gain
complexity
with
each
sip
drinkability
is
good
excellent
balance
almost
completely
hiding
the
alcohol
nice
malt
depth
a
fine
beer
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
small
traces
of
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
is
very
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
nice
biscuit
malt
notes
with
medium
sweetness
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
nicely
done
but
nothing
earth
shattering
in
here
pours
a
slightly
hazed
amber
almost
golden
decently
thick
off
white
head
forms
not
as
voluminous
as
most
triples
but
still
decent

some

strawberries

and

in
the

some

as
well
just
a

but
its
nicely
hidden
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
smooth
nice
dry
finish
little
bit
of
warmth
surprisingly
great
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
english
triple
but
it
tastes
like
a
tripel
with
british
influence
well
done
d
im
not
particularly
fond
of
the
earthymineral
flavour
and
the
alcohol
warmth
despite
the
fiziness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
thin
but
in
that
loveable
english
ale
sort
of
way
this
i
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
the
british
ability
to
completely
mask
alcohol
is
unnerving
id
drink
this
again
perhaps
would
be
interesting
to
try
when
wellaged
this
is
a
tastey
strong
ale
vibrantly
hoppy
and
full
of
malt
and
yeast
goodness
my
only
criticism
is
the
alcohol
could
be
more
hidden
love
it
d
pretty
good
english
ale
that
had
decent
balance
between
hops
malts
worth
a
try
has
a
smooth
drinkable
feel
on
the
palate
notes
of
citrus
sweet
malt
dried
herbs
and
a
yeasty
fruitiness
another
great
beer
from
the
u
k
the
triple
tag
is
not
unjustified
although
this
beer
is
not
as
complex
as
the
top
belgians
id
say
this
is
between
a
tripel
and
strong
ale
in
style
for
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
i
can
get
at
the
supermarket
easily
this
is
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
i
thought
overall
a
decent
brew
mayme
more

like
any
ontario
beer
drinker
in
the
early
00s
or
the
two
decades
prior
i
was
weaned
onto
craft
beer
by
granite
brewery
back
when
that
was
one
of
the
only
games
in
town
at
that
time
peculiar
was
about
as
rich
and
complex
as
beer
got
in
toronto
how
far
weve
come
sadly
while
i
still
maintain
fond
memories
of
this
old
ale
it
hasnt
translated
well
from
cask
to
the
bottle
overall
the
odd
tartlacticvinegar
flavour
threw
me
off
with
this
one
just
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
o
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
lets
you
know
right
up
front
that
this
is
a
british
style
ale
the
flavor
and
body
are
just
screaming
pub
ale
to
me
and
i
would
happily
have
a
pint
or
two
again
if
offered
clearreddish
brown
colour
one
finger
of

s
a

this
is

but
not

interesting
though
would
not
pass
up
if
offered
but
not
somethign
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
surprisingly
easy
for
a
beer
this
dark
one
of
my
alltime
favourites
poured
a
dark

bordering
on
burgundy

a

underlying
dark

with
some

and

to
the

great
mouthfeel
full
good
drink
something
to
check
out
a
really
nice
pint
that
is
made
for
cask
light
grassy
bitterness
with
a
pleasant
hop
bite
in
the
finish
but
this
not
about
the
hops
cocoa
earth
a
hint
of
rust
caramel
toast
light
flavored
but
nuanced
and
pleasant
the
almost
complete
lack
of
carbonation
suits
it
as
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
pleasing
drawing
out
the
flavor
an
easy
pint
to
finish
and
i
would
gladly
have
another
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
dry
but
sweet
dense
but
light
a
nice
caramel
undertone
which
i
feel
balances
the
fuggle
hops
that
are
used
in
the
mix
just
fantastic
a
great
beer
to
have
with
some
bangers
and
mash
a
pretty
sturdy
fullflavoured
beer
i
could
see
the
appeal
of
having
this
as
an
old
standby
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
not
bad
on
tap
at
the
granite
brewery
in
toronto
deep
ruby
red
liquid
underneath
a
huge
rocky
head
beautiful
to
look
at
aroma
and
flavour
both
have
strong
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
this
beer
is
also
pleasantly
smooth
and
fresh
tasting
a
very
sessionable
drink
pulled
from
a
hand
pump
not
two
feet
from
my
seat
this
beer
pours
out
a
beautiful
deep
red
with
brownish
hints
and
a
light
tan
head
that
settles
out
from
a
foamy
body
and
lasts
very
well
leaving
solid
lacing
some
light
citrusy
hops
come
on
top
of
a
deep
and
resiny
malt
base
almost
an
old
ale
but
well
classified
i
think
as
an
english
strong
the
complexity
showing
with
the
very
moderate
abv
is
impressive
coffee
and
piles
of
thick
caramel
sticky
and
sweet
taste
only
improves
upon
the
promise
held
in
the
scent
vinous
notes
pour
forth
the
hoppiness
showing
well
in
a
balancing
role
but
not
distracting
from
the
real
show
the
strong
malts
and
barleywine
character
nuttiness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
typical
for
cask
plenty
of
body
though
and
quite
warming
drinkability
is
excellent
my
favourite
granite
brew
just
great
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
and
low
alcohol
presence
make
it
very
drinkable
this
was
the
whiskey
barrel
aged
offering
at
volo
cask
days
there
was
a
faint
smoke
aroma
in
addition
to
the
regular
malty
profile
the
barrel
added
a
bit
of
whiskey
sweetness
to
the
flavour
as
well
as
a
sharp
smokiness
that
was
a
bit
out
of
balance
it
was
great
to
see
the
brewer
trying
something
new
with
a
long
established
product
hopefully
well
see
this
one
again
d
quite
good
enjoyable
overall
i
preferred
this
to
the
bottle
version
nice
compliment
to
an
enjoyable
meal

this
is
a

canadian
ale
closely
based

from
the
uk
its
a
little
to
sweet
from
me
and
the
malts
a
little
too
plummy
served
on
tap
at

brewery
peculiar
is
a
nutty
reddish

colour
with

when
poured
smells
interesting
maltiness
and
a
little
bit
of
citrusy

i
love
the
taste
of
this
brew
dark
malty
sweet
with
some
fruitiness
and
a
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
very
full
and
creamy
i
love
this
beer
very
much
and
i
think
it
has
very
high
drinkability
i
suggest
anyone
in
toronto
who
hasnt
been
to
granite
yet
does
so
this
review
supplements
my
bottle
review
below
the
ontap
is
more
carbonated
bit
more
of
a
head
fresher
and
served
colder
for
taste
i
prefered
the
bottle
the
ontap
would
go
better
with
food
and
was
a
good
mix
in
the
session
still
coffee
toastiness
apparent
less
brown
appearance

english

not
spectacular
o
a

flavoured
offering
from
this
brewer
a
worthy
beer
indeed
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
nothing
complex
or
overpowering
but
delivers
on
flavour
and
even
though
it
seemed
very
carbonated
when
poured
after
drinking
over
half
i
had
no
excess
gas
or
boating
which
seemed
likely
would
have
again
when
looking
for
something
smooth
to
relax
d
this
is
a
solid
drinking
ale
however
i
found
humor
in
this
being
styled
as
enlish
strong
ale
dr
very
good
very
pricey
the
beer
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
with
some
lighter
fruit
the
flavor
is
grain
grassy
hops
and
earthy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
to
much
going
on

and
a
good

a
very
drinkable

i
will
definitely
purchase
this
one
again
from

this
beer
pours
a
pale
see
thru
amber
colour
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
with
sporadic
lacing
here
and
thereit
has
big
aromas
of
nice
fruity
hopsit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
a
very
dominant
fruity
hop
driven
taste
that
finishes
quite
sweet
for
the
style
with
a
barleywinish
finish
and
no
hint
of
alcohol
whatsoevera
very
easy
beer
to
drink
that
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
wouldnt
knock
back
if
offered
more
intricate
than
the
average
english
strong
ale
and
the
hops
make
it
a
good
summer
drinker
to
boot
great
drinkability
i
could
stay
on
this
for
3
pints
no
problem
not
a
great
english
strong
ale
but
worth
a
try
and
so
now
you
know
professor
homer
may
not
love
the
english
so
much
but
he
sure
does
love
their
beers
especially
those
from
the
lake
district
of
england
approaching
his
beloved
scotland
ah
scotland
home
to
men
in
skirts
kilts
and
those
fine
winter
wee
heavies
pours
a
clear
tanorange
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
smell
is
a
hint
of
malt
taste
is
toasty
malt
a
hint
of
butter
definite
british
yeast
strain
a
hint
of
earthy
hop
flavor
as
well
bitterness
levels
match
up
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
high
carbonation
though
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
it
usually
is
with
english
ales
labeled
as
a
strong
ale
at
5
2
abv
it
is
by
british
standards
for
cask
ale
but
in
the
us
its
average
gravity
would
drink
again
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
large
dirty
white
head
a
huge
rush
of
carbonation
keeps
the
head
holding
on
for
a
while
nice
chunky
webbed
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
of
bubble
gum
hops
and
malts
tastes
much
better
than
expected
with
some
fruit
a
decent
malt
backbone
and
a
little
candy
sweetness
in
the
background
a
very
faint
bitterness
is
also
noticed
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
nicely
and
just
a
tad
on
the
dry
side
ill
admit
im
not
a
big
fan
of
british
brews
but
this
one
is
just
unique
enough
and
tasty
enough
to
win
me
over
and
i
have
to
wonder
if
its
heritage
might
cost
it
some
points
i
dont
think
of
this
as
a
strong
ale
at
all
it
seems
more
like
a
good
pale
ale
well
coordinated
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
this
one
slides
down
very
easily
tasting
almost
exactly
as
the
nose
suggests
a
simple
beer
done
well
pours
a
light
amber
with
relatively
thin
head
and
some
light
lacing
smells
quite
malty
and
relatively
dry
but
not
biscuity
oddly
there
is
a
smell
of
alcohol
despite
the
relatively
tame
abv
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
copper
rounds
it
out
tastes
pretty
light
for
a
strong
ale
and
there
is
a
touch
of
grainy
sourness
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
finish
is
a
bit
of
soapiness
in
between
is
malty
and
round
but
a
bit
thin
a
little
boring
for
the
style
and
not
as
rich
or
pleasing
as
it
could
be
okay
this
is
one
of
the
two
beers
i
brought
back
with
me
from
europe
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
proper
reviews
purchased
in
eastern
london
the
day
before
flying
back
to
the
states
halfliter
bottle
brewed
with
english
golding
fuggles
and
brambling
cross
it
pours
a
crystalclear
amber
with
low
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
frothy
offwhite
head
very
pleasant
aroma
with
soft
perfumy
and
citric
notes
and
a
late
malt
sweetness
on
the
palate
its
a
barrage
of
delicious
hops
that
deliver
a
big
dose
of
orange
along
with
some
herbal
and
perfumy
notes
the
hops
become
more
pungent
as
i
go
and
impart
a
slowlyincreasing
bitterness
pretty
dry
medium
body
with
adequate
carbonation
and
a
longish
finish
not
the
best
beer
from
my
two
months
in
europe
but
far
from
the
worst
and
it
makes
for
a
tasty
hoppedup
english
ale
that
is
worth
the
purchase
if
you
ever
come
across
it
pours
an
orange
amber
with
a
considerable
head
which
settles
after
a
while
it
leaves
a
good
lacing
on
the
glass
moderate
nose
malty
and
fruity
strong
tasting
beer
with
hints
of
spice
amidst
the
malt
and
touch
of
caramel
lot
of
body
makes
for
a
good
mouthful
i
havent
had
thwaites
before
i
think
it
brings
more
of
a
northern
style
i
drink
with
all
my
senses
this
didnt
look
great
and
the
mouthfeel
let
it
down
too
not
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
or
long
for
a
very
flavourful
big
english
ale
its
no
1845
or
special
london
ale
but
its
good
other
comments
this
is
nice
a
commemorative
beer
that
actually
steps
out
a
bit
as
opposed
to
just
tasting
like
any
other
typical
english
ale
scrumptious
overall
a
very
good
strong
not
really
that
strong
ale
i
initially
thought
it
was
going
to
be
too
sweet
but
thankfully
it
became
much
more
balanced
after
the
first
few
mouthfuls
recommended
