an
excellent
bitter
surpassed
only
by
their
old
marcus
if
you
like
beer
with
flavor
youll
like
this
one
i
would
love
to
try
another
to
get
a
more
objective
review
until
then
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
give
it
a
try
im
really
getting
into
english
bitters
these
days
and
i
love
this
one
a
lot
overall
very
enjoyable
i
would
drink
this
again
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
esb
it
has
a
nice
estery
citrusyhop
character
as
well
as
a
solid
hoppy
bitter
finish
the
flavor
isnt
as
full
as
i
would
like
but
this
definitely
has
a
solid
flavor
profile
and
tremendous
drinkability
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youd
like
something
refreshing
and
sessionable
i
like
it
even
if
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
check
it
out
though
this
esb
doesnt
have
the
masculine
complexities
and
authentic
nutty
malt
taste
of
fullers
esb
the
taste
and
simplicity
of
american
specialty
malts
and
restrained
yeast
character
keeps
its
palate
a
little
short
and
simple
notes
looks
fine
smells
great
tastes
pretty
good
this
is
a
fine
little
beer
and
priced
right
almost
more
like
an
american
ipa
in
style
than
an
english
bitter
smells
like
big
west
coast
hops
fresh
and
bold
some
sturdy
english
malts
underneath
flavor
is
beastly
and
bitter
but
not
in
an
imperial
only
drink
one
kind
of
way
its
hoppy
and
dry
refreshingly
crisp
and
more
drinkable
than
the
name
implies
its
got
a
great
pine
hop
profile
only
really
getting
bitter
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
body
with
some
caramel
notes
and
prominent
carbonation
which
is
uncommon
in
the
english
style
ales
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
difficult
to
categorize
perfectly
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
mixed
12pack
oa
nice
esb
there
are
better
beers
out
there
it
was
worth
the
try
beast
bitter
is
actually
very
tame
but
striking
nonetheless
its
floral
earthy
resinous
hopping
and
mineralrich
water
make
it
as
refreshing
as
a
premoistened
towelette
its
definitely
the
kind
of
beer
worth
buying
six
of
and
probably
the
kind
most
people
could
just
sit
down
and
drink
six
of
to
themselves
too
o
breat
bitter
not
sure
why
it
is
called
the
beast
but
it
beats
out
most
other
of
this
style
highly
recommended
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
given
the
disparity
in
the
bros
and
the
peoples
ratings
and
my
relative
lack
of
experience
with
esbs
it
was
alright
drink
worthy
but
nothing
that
stopped
me
the
beer
has
a
gorgeous
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
carwash
lacing
nose
is
pungent
with
cereal
and
only
the
mildest
detection
of
hops
the
taste
is
much
the
same
but
the
honey
very
present
honeycomb
is
robbed
of
its
sweetness
and
is
instead
replaced
with
a
very
cereal
oaty
taste
that
has
an
iron
touch
which
maybe
where
the
hops
come
in
i
didnt
not
enjoy
drinking
it
but
it
never
made
me
think
or
savor
good
compared
to
other
esbs
ive
had
but
i
think
the
buck
stops
there
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
pretty
good
looking
head
on
it
the
head
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
but
not
too
much
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
malty
its
a
little
sweet
and
earthy
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
lot
of
the
same
features
as
the
smell
mostly
malts
dominate
the
flavors
here
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
decent
id
say
its
average
for
an
esb
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
probably
worth
a
try
i
cant
say
that
id
run
out
for
more
right
away
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
esb
easy
to
drink
and
some
light
fruit
with
the
light
bitterness
would
have
it
again
medium
body
a
bit
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
a
bit
chewy
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
nice
esb
and
nice
balance
of
bitter
hops
and
bready
malt
o
while
i
think
this
could
stand
to
contain
a
little
more
of
a
malt
character
to
help
balance
out
the
heavier
bitterness
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
enjoy
over
an
evening
its
definitely
flavorful
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
it
is
actually
quite
clean
on
the
palate
i
recommend
this
one
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
middle
ages
product
this
is
the
sort
of
esb
that
can
renew
or
ignite
ones
love
of
the
style
as
well
as
make
me
really
appreciate
different
interpretations
a
fantastic
effort
from
these
guys
d
good
tasting
bitter
hints
of
orange
peel
and
caramel
glad
i
had
this
medium
bodied
brew
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
those
who
like
bitters
overall
a
decent
americanized
pale
ale
light
malts
that
are
distinguishable
nice
grassy
hop
profile
semi
bitter
but
not
astringent
o
d
good
and
tasty
but
dryness
slows
you
down
a
true
bitter
in
terms
of
flavor
the
malt
is
present
but
it
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
smooth
but
thin
there
is
heightened
level
of
carbonation
naturally
the
aftertaste
is
mild
bitterness
i
detect
a
touch
of
sourness
overall
a
balanced
bitter
very
decent
brew
never
had
an
esb
style
before
this
is
the
highest
rated
so
i
hope
others
can
keep
up
pours
golden
orange
with
a
lot
of
white
head
a
good
combination
of
big
and
small
bubbles
on
the
head
nice
lacing
smells
hoppy
and
bitter
with
a
nice
balance
tastes
malty
hoppy
bitter
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
really
a
very
well
balanced
beer
geat
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
bitter
overall
i
much
more
agree
with
the
bros
rating
of
this
one
a
phenomenal
representation
of
style
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
yet
it
is
prickly
and
effervescent
for
a
bit
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
and
fairly
good
representation
of
the
style
quite
a
clingy
resinous
bitterness
hangs
on
the
tongue
i
dont
know
how
fresh
this
sample
was
but
it
was
quite
unique
and
enjoyable
d
esbs
arent
really
my
thing
but
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
the
style
that
drinks
really
well
this
is
a
delicious
brew
from
middle
ages
brewery
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
have
anytime
anyplace
the
drinkability
of
this
one
in
my
books
is
very
high
and
it
comes
highly
recommended
body
is
medium
higher
carbonation
drinkibility
is
low
an
odd
flavor
but
i
would
try
it
again
as
this
appears
to
maybe
be
an
old
or
off
bottle
this
clear
deep
orangered
brew
gives
a
healthy
inch
of
frothy
stable
light
tan
head
from
a
moderate
pour
smell
has
a
semisweet
sugar
and
honey
background
supporting
and
balanced
by
a
nice
dose
of
dry
mixed
citrus
and
pine
hops
the
taste
is
less
sweet
than
the
nose
implied
pretty
dry
it
has
equal
amounts
of
bitter
and
sour
makes
me
think
of
those
sour
patch
kids
gummi
candy
things
the
body
is
pretty
thin
but
the
feel
still
comes
across
as
creamy
to
some
extent
great
thick
lacing
throughout
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
great
combination
of
bitter
and
sour
with
enough
malt
body
to
back
it
up
without
interfering
this
drinks
pretty
well
not
a
bad
beer
to
session
nothing
extremely
flavorful
but
its
pretty
true
to
style
i
would
drink
this
again
but
im
prolly
not
going
to
go
searching
for
it
if
im
offered
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
drinkability
i
could
have
several
of
these
super
clean
and
surprisingly
very
fruity
i
like
this
one
alot
for
the
style
middle
ages
beast
bitter
is
a
very
clear
and
very
lively
amber
ale
with
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
looks
like
theres
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
on
this
beer
it
has
a
very
wooden
aroma
it
kind
of
smells
like
an
old
attic
there
is
a
note
of
toffeelike
sweetness
and
tart
green
apple
in
the
nose
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
very
smooth
the
finish
is
dry
a
little
watery
and
a
little
chalky
its
amply
bitter
wooden
and
herbal
the
tart
green
apple
note
is
present
in
the
taste
its
slightly
sweet
but
the
bitterness
keeps
it
in
check
the
aftertaste
seems
fruity
its
not
totally
pulled
together
but
its
a
pretty
inoffensive
session
ale
it
kind
of
seems
like
a
home
brew
md
foamy
in
the
mouth
not
very
pleasant
at
all
i
will
not
be
trying
this
one
again
d
ive
been
looking
for
my
daily
drinking
beer
with
a
moderate
abv
and
a
taste
that
suggests
an
eagerness
to
be
sessioned
i
think
ive
found
it
at
9six
its
not
the
cheapest
beer
but
its
a
very
local
brew
and
one
of
their
very
best
highly
recommended
d
the
finish
of
this
beer
kind
of
turned
me
off
i
was
hooked
with
the
name
and
after
smelling
the
beer
but
once
i
took
that
first
sip
my
impression
was
lowered
i
love
this
brewery
but
this
one
was
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
bad
bottle
maybe
i
hope
so
d
this
is
a
great
brew
the
presentation
combines
with
the
appearance
and
taste
to
create
a
great
brew
middle
ages
is
geared
towards
their
other
brews
at
times
i
think
this
is
hands
down
their
best
brew
and
a
great
treat
for
the
bitter
profile
enthusiast
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
with
flavor
and
substance
that
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
while
d
very
good
considering
the
style
i
could
go
for
another
although
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
d
an
awesome
esb
great
sessionable
beer
that
is
balanced
very
well
d
very
drinkable
quite
a
nice
esb
i
bought
one
to
try
it
but
definitely
wouldve
enjoyed
a
couple
more
drinkability
overall
i
give
it
a
3
for
drinkability
as
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
i
believe
with
a
better
mouthfeel
it
would
really
bring
out
the
flavors
and
smells
a
bit
more
drinkability
a
fairly
solid
esb
though
id
prefer
it
slightly
maltier
i
could
session
a
few
of
these
though
the
aroma
is
hoppy
as
expected
after
reading
the
bottle
a
biscuity
malt
and
bitter
aroma
are
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
it
is
well
balanced
once
it
warms
and
the
malt
characters
come
through
there
is
a
faint
bit
of
apple
and
black
pepper
flavor
in
there
fairly
interesting
if
you
look
for
it
carbonation
is
low
contributing
to
the
smoothness
very
easy
drinking
pours
a
very
nice
hazy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hop
note
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slight
hop
bitterness
with
some
caramel
medium
body
the
finish
is
drybitter
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
esb
d
good
tasty
and
sessionable
note
great
label
featuring
a
sleeping
dragon
and
a
witty
poem
about
the
liquid
libation
inside
the
bottle
middle
ages
continues
to
be
a
highly
underrated
brewery
in
my
opinion
d
very
good
beautiful
pour
from
the
cask
big
foamy
lasting
head
with
some
lacing
dark
amber
hue
smells
floral
but
not
overly
intense
first
sip
had
a
very
nice
thick
and
buttery
mouthfeel
finish
is
definitely
bitter
and
sour
as
well
apple
grape
some
fruit
there
very
drinkable
though
it
could
use
a
better
aftertaste
in
my
opinion
my
first
esb
and
will
have
to
try
again
overall
a
nice
little
light
ale
not
really
what
i
was
looking
for
but
decent
none
the
less
monster
head
beautiful
lacing
about
which
i
usually
could
care
less
deep
amber
color
a
nose
that
penetrates
even
my
deadened
sense
of
smell
crisp
outdoorsy
kind
of
peachy
the
taste
is
sharp
doesnt
get
old
mouth
feel
is
clean
with
a
nice
light
hoppiness
imperial
stout
is
my
choice
but
i
could
definitely
get
into
drinking
this
5
3
abv
a
little
light
for
my
likes
makes
it
a
beer
you
could
stay
with
a
while
this
is
a
very
traditional
and
representative
beer
of
the
style
there
is
a
slight
butterscotch
and
sour
dough
breadiness
to
the
beer
there
is
also
a
bit
of
course
graininess
maybe
a
bit
husky
as
well
most
pronounced
is
the
nice
bittering
hop
presence
there
is
a
grapefruity
tangy
and
estery
hop
characteristic
in
the
background
but
a
more
traditional
leafy
and
bittering
hop
presence
up
front
the
beer
is
slightly
crisp
but
not
overly
so
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
actually
quite
carbonated
for
the
style
the
beer
has
a
nice
balance
between
cream
and
crispness
and
between
the
drying
and
leafy
hops
and
the
more
floral
estery
hop
the
beer
is
fairly
complex
and
very
nice
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
bittering
mouthfeel
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
drinkability
the
initial
taste
of
the
beer
was
great
but
the
aftertaste
really
killed
my
opinion
of
this
bitter
i
would
have
another
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
all
in
all
not
an
everyday
beer
but
definitely
a
refreshing
break
from
the
usual
styles
that
are
prevalent
this
time
of
year
would
definitely
try
again
but
not
a
regular
beer
for
me
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
dthis
is
a
decent
beer
but
a
so
so
esb
still
i
would
not
refuse
one
if
offered
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
its
brethren
across
the
pond
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
3
fingers
of
frothy
khaki
colored
head
ok
retention
spotty
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
caramel
bread
dough
spices
and
butter
taste
starts
out
with
a
touch
of
citrus
before
lots
of
caramel
malt
and
bread
take
over
finishes
with
spicy
and
earthen
hops
with
lots
of
buttery
notes
medium
in
body
with
some
fizzy
carbonation
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
dough
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
presence
and
odd
butter
flavors
in
the
finish
not
very
bittering
not
one
i
would
get
again
head
very
drinkable
due
to
the
balanced
nature
solid
yet
understated
esb
that
shows
a
good
beer
doesnt
have
to
feature
stark
contrasts
to
stand
out
a
first
try
at
this
brewery
for
me
and
im
looking
forward
to
a
few
more
i
could
see
fish
and
chips
pairing
well
drinkability
is
quite
nice
and
i
enjoy
it
more
as
it
warmed
slightly
definitely
recommended
the
taste
is
earthy
tealeafy
and
citric
grapefruitlemon
there
is
a
caramelish
backing
wellbalanced
leaning
towards
bitterish
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
easy
to
drink
an
esb
with
an
american
flair
a
nice

this
beer
is

a
person
with
a
spray
tan
unnatural
looking
and
tasting
pours
a
slightly
hazy
icedtea
orange
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
pool
of
irridescent
bubbles
that
dont
really
stick
to
the
sides
of
my
nonic
a
fruity
lemontangerinelike
smell
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
and
alcohol
a
decent
hop
bite
initially
that
drifts
into
a
nice
noble
hop
flavor
some
subtle
hints
of
cereal
grain
and
darker
fruits
a
bit
citrusy
and
mineral
in
the
finish
a
lightmed
body
with
moderate
carbonation
feels
creamy
on
the
tounge
a
pretty
decent
esb
and
quite
drinkable
d
solid
offering
lots
of
flavour
and
good
balance
drinkability
is
a
bit
less
than
the
bottled
as
the
carbonation
on
tap
will
just
about
kill
you
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
orangeamber

decent

halfinch
offwhite

quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin

skim

the
remnants
of

mostly
pooling
around
the
edges
lots
of
effervescence
present
in
the
glass
virtually
no

during
the
tasting
mild

is
significantly
more
pronounced

itself
as

of
apricot
present
as
the
brew
warmed
finish
is
somewhat
astringent
and
lingers
lively
mouthfeel
without
the
carbonation
burn
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
however
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
d
excellent
drinking
brew
drinkability
is
okay
strong
aromas
of
citrusy
piney
hops
come
right
to
the
front
of
this
beer
caramel
malts
and
some
horse
blanket
come
to
mind
as
well
slight
oak
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
the
aromas
and
some
other
off
flavors
as
well
i
want
to
say
diacytel
but
it
is
not
buttery
caramel
lemonygrapefruit
citrus
flavors
really
nice
warm
combo
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
med
and
carbonated
maybe
a
little
too
much
overall
one
of
the
best
i
think
to
come
out
of
middle
ages
i
love
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
all
the
time
other
very
impressed
where
have
you
been
all
my
life
pours
a
hazed
amber
gold
nose
is
a
sweet
tone
with
a
bitter
hoppy
edge
flavor
is
doughy
with
a
slight
bitter
tone
and
a
slightly
larger
sweet
edge
feel
is
slightly
thick
with
bubble
on
the
tongue
and
a
thicker
liquid
feel
overall
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
i
have
had
a
few
of
this
breweries
beers
over
the
past
day
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
fairly
impressed
d
this
beer
is
almost
as
sweet
as
it
smells
its
not
quite
as
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
but
its
pretty
wellbalanced
not
a
bad
bitter
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
hs
a
nice
caramel
maltiness
and
a
pleasant
aroma
i
like
this
beer
but
dont
think
i
will
search
it
out
again
not
that
it
is
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
dont
do
anything
for
me
mabey
its
just
the
style
sorry
middle
ages
d
i
wouldnt
drink
this
brew
all
day
maybe
now
and
then
but
not
a
fridgestocker
this
one
isnt
really
my
favorite
i
dont
hate
it
but
its
an
ok
brew
middle
ages
has
yet
to
impress
me
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
relatively
weak
head
kind
of
disappointed
by
the
head
the
smell
is
very
citrusy
which
tells
me
hops
are
abundantly
present
good
thing
taste
is
very
strange
little
citrus
earthy
maybe
even
actually
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
strange
taste
mouthfeel
is
rather
flat
and
unappealing
drinkability
is
average
picked
this
up
at
half
time
in
ny
pours
a
clear
burnt
orange
maybe
sienna
leaving
a
frothy
tan
head
that
stays
and
clings
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nice
grassy
honey
earthy
hops
bread
perhaps
grain
and
full
of
character
the
taste
is
strong
bitter
upfront
but
balanced
with
a
nice
honey
doughy
malt
feel
this
is
a
strong
bitter
def
not
your
typical
english
bitter
it
has
just
enough
balance
to
keep
it
from
being
an
ipa
and
is
pretty
tasty
nice
light
color
with
an
ok
head
a
few
trails
of
lacing
first
wiff
is
very
appealing
strong
grapefruit
hops
odor
during
the
pour
mixed
with
some
piney
notes
by
halfway
down
the
glass
the
smell
has
become
mostly
biscuity
bready
malts
and
is
much
less
appealing
taste
is
very
earthy
with
some
hay
like
notes
and
then
i
pick
up
that
typical
middle
ages
flavor
buttery
and
somewhat
mettalic
i
want
to
like
their
beers
but
they
just
dont
do
it
for
me
not
a
terrible
beer
but
what
started
out
with
such
promise
at
first
wiff
from
the
bottle
ended
up
dissapointing
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
hue
with
a
huge
fluffy
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
slowly
dies
down
a
while
after
pour
love
the
lacing
on
this
one
stickiness
is
all
over
the
place
smell
is
a
sweet
buttery
aroma
with
the
typical
middle
ages
ringwood
yeast
thats
always
there
taste
starts
off
with
a
sweet
bready
malt
thats
followed
by
a
grassy
hop
bite
finishes
crisp
and
smooth
love
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
put
these
down
one
after
another
middle
ages
represents
this
style
so
well
so
happy
i
basically
live
next
door
to
this
place
keep
it
up
guys
make
the
cuse
proud
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
although
not
outstanding
ale
one
thing
i
definitely
find
with
these
english
ales
is
that
it
is
best
to
drink
them
after
theyve
warmed
slightly
only
then
does
their
true
character
come
out
flavor
is
deadon
english
bitter
not
heavy
on
the
malts
or
hops
until
the
finish
when
the
hops
just
rise
out
of
the
back
of
the
throat
and
waft
to
the
forefront
of
the
tongue
and
then
a
water
crackerlike
finish
comes
out
to
balance
off
the
bitterness
fairly
light
body
and
nice
to
drink
on
a
warm
evening
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
refreshing
i
wish
the
malts
were
a
little
bit
more
on
the
sweet
side
nothing
bad
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
again

a

it

to

with
bitterness
once
again
a
pithy

aftertaste
lingers
carbonation
is
a
bit
aggressive
almost
abrasive
drinkability
is
average
the
least
impressive
offering
ive
had
from
middle
ages
but
still
a
good
beer
creamy
and
with
good
body
pleasant
aftertaste
with
no
film
left
over
this
is
a
magnificent
brew
its
hoppy
but
doesnt
make
a
fetish
out
of
it
subdued
but
lets
you
know
the
hops
are
there
the
taste
starts
to
a
bitter
peach
and
stays
there
to
end
this
product
would
be
much
better
if
they
could
shorten
the
lingering
aftertaste
that
said
a
nice
brew
with
lingeringto
much
character
thanks
plaid75
for
the
opportunity
pours
a

is
lots
of

little

some
toffeebuttery

mostly
citrus

more

put
this

ringwood
if
you
like
the
two
of
those
youll
like
this
beer
easy
drinking
with
citrusy
hops
and
fruity
ringwood
with
a
little
butterscotch
not
terribly
complex
but
wellmade
and
wellbalanced
to
put
it
in

on
the
bitter

a
notch
down

smells
a

with

bit
of

smooth
hoppy
with
a
bit
of

perfect

so
crisp
clean
and
light
on

palate
i
could
drink
it
all
night
this
is
at
this
point
in
time
my
favorite
beer
i
have
moved
to
pa
but
go
to
the
brewery
at
least
once
a
month
to
pick
up
some
more
beast
bitter
i
love
it
overall
my
2nd
favorite
beer
in
the
case
a
good
beer
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
with
a
huge
head
on
it
the
color
is
a
slightly
hazt
slightly
darker
golden
color
the
aroma
is
a
bit
floral
with
some
sweetness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
mishmash
of
flavors
they
all
seems
to
collide
and
dont
balance
well
at
all
definitely
bitter
and
dry
at
the
end
ok
but
i
probably
wont
be
coming
back
to
this
one
overall
a
nice
spicy
esb
a
very
sessionable
upstate
ny
beer
one
of
the
few
esbs
ive
had
that
was
actually
bitter
not
sure
of
the
ibus
here
but
theyre
probably
in
the
60s
or
above
nice
grapefruite
flavor
pervades
with
a
slight
pine
finish
no
malt
characteristic
at
all
which
is
somewhat
surprising
for
an
esb
this
one
plays
more
like
an
ipa
and
is
a
better
example
of
that
style
hazy
burnt
sienna
pour
appears
very
carbonated
with
lots
of
bubbles
headed
skyward
from
the
bottom
and
a
circular
pool
of
strange
bubbles
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
beer
all
exactly
the
same
in
size
and
shape
its
aliiive
very
floral
aroma
strawberries
and
peaches
a
bit
chalky
on
the
palate
but
the
solid
flow
of
herbal
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
and
tingling
carbonation
in
the
finish
make
that
go
away
quickly
toffee
and
strawberry
are
noticeable
but
the
hops
do
their
best
to
dominate
the
other
flavors
and
smack
around
the
palate
a
bit
a
pretty
nice
drinker
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
very
drinkable
this
would
make
for
an
awesome
session
beer
i
cant
get
this
in
my
area
so
ill
be
keeping
my
eye
open
for
it
next
time
im
out
of
town
for
sure
mouthfeel
needs
work
overly
carbonated
and
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
pours
a
cloudy
pale
copper
under
a
one
finger
white
head
with
lots
of
bubbles
the
head
fades
quickly
to
thick
film
but
leaves
lots
of
lace
spots
the
nose
is
coniferous
with
a
touch
of
malt
fighting
its
way
through
the
sap
the
mouth
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
the
flavor
profile
is
about
right
with
mild
sweet
plum
in
the
malt
chased
by
pretty
strong
pine
bitterness
the
finish
is
strong
and
dry
while
the
aftertaste
fades
quickly
to
a
dry
tickle
at
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
is
enjoyable
enough
but
something
lacks
here

is
nicely
balanced

nice
smooth

not
over
powering
recommended
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
with
no
complaints
middle
ages
is
an
excellent
brewery
with
superior
products
they
are
truly
a
joy
to
drink
dont
be
fooled
by
its
name
this
is
by
no
means
a
hop
bomb
very
tasty
bitter
reminds
me
of
a
true
english
pint
a
la
fullers
sweet
and
hoppy
all
at
the
same
time
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
leafy
aftertaste
and
somewhat
oily
pleasant
all
around
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
beer
thats
very
easy
to
quaff
nice
another
nice
english
style
ale
from
middle
ages
happy
to
have
access
to
them
again
after
too
many
years
pours
goldenamber
with
an
inch
or
so
of
frothy
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
to
a
thin
surface
aroma
is
yeasty
buttery
diacetly
and
some
mild
hops
the
taste
is
quite
good
butterscotch
and
noticably
bitter
with
hops
more
bitterness
at
the
end
with
a
slight
mineral
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
also
very
good
sort
of
oily
with
the
hop
bitterness
and
tingly
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
complex
but
goes
down
very
easily
i
picked
up
a
single
to
compare
this
with
fullers
since
im
trying
to
educate
myself
about
esbs
and
this
one
is
definitely
the
superior
brew
next
time
ill
go
for
a
whole
sixer
nice
i
really
need
to
drink
more
esbs
this
beer
is
excellent
more
buttery
than
malty
but
its
an
aspect
that
i
really
enjoyed
bitter
but
not
overdone
super
drinkable
more
please
a
quality
esb
and
well
worth
drinking
beer
is
good
happy
esb
beering
drinkability
of
this
is
good
not
a
stereotypical
esb
by
any
means
and
im
not
sure
if
i
would
classify
it
as
such
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
one
of
the
best
bitters
in
the
world
imo
middle
ages
has
set
the
standard
with
the
ringwood
yorkshire
yeast
and
not
many
brewers
have
come
even
close
drinkability
eh
tastefeel
very
dry
mouthfeel
almost
makes
you
more
thirsty
as
you
drink
good
amount
of
sweetness
and
real
clean
bitterness
though
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
bitterness
was
a
little
too
clean
very
sterile
unleashed
out
of
the
12
oz
brown
bottle
the
beast
came
out
with
cleat
pale
orange
body
with
a
foamy
two
finger
head
that
lasted
a
short
while
before
leaving
wispy
lace
spread
out
all
around
the
rim
very
little
latent
carbonation
lingered
around
the
aroma
was
well
balanced
between
fruity
and
bready
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
delicate
and
subtle
with
some
toasted
biscuit
like
malts
and
earthy
bittering
hops
there
was
a
touch
of
buttery
flavor
indicative
of
diacetyl
but
it
was
well
in
check
and
felt
quite
appropriate
here
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
with
the
fine
light
carbonation
aftertaste
was
slightly
sour
followed
by
a
long
drawn
out
bitter
fade
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
thankfully
left
out
or
masked
a
lot
of
the
funky
flavors
associated
with
the
ringwood
yeast
thanks
to
shippos
for
bringing
this
one
my
way
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
caramel
character
but
is
mostly
comprised
of
an
american
hop
that
dominates
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
and
is
slightly
unbalanced
in
this
way
for
an
esb
it
has
too
much
american
hops
its
a
tasty
brew
but
too
much
hop
flavor
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
again
thanks

this
my

this
pours
a
fine
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
big
in
citrusy
hops
with
a
small
caramel
backbone
the
flavor
is
rather
hoppy
too
hoppy
for
an
esb
in
my
humble
opinion
the
hop
is
nice
and
citrusy
sweet
not
lingereing
and
very
crisp
the
hop
fades
to
a
nice
orange
sweetness
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
i
like
it
its
more
of
an
ipa
to
me
but
still
a
refreshing
and
tasty
beer

a
medium
amber
with
a
relatively
good

quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
aroma
is
not
very
pronounced
there
is
just
a
hint
of
a
citrus
mingled
with
very
crisp
roasted
malt
this
is
a
bitter
for
sure
starts
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
but
as
it
hits
the
middle
of
the
tongue
the
pleasantly
intense
hop
bitterness
hits
surprisingly
this
leaves
little
aftertaste
very
nice

the
aroma
but
they
are
a
tad
bit
subdued
it
seems
that
cluster
and
fuggles
hops
were
used
in
this
brew
the
taste
is
fruity
up

with
a
grainy
buttery
bready

in

finish
that

to
take
another

seem
a
little
watery
at
first
but
after
the
hop
pulverize
your
mouth
it
doesnt
feel
so
pronounced
some
bitter
and
malt
and
hops
and
yeast
ok
bitter
somehow
going
off
in
different
directions
drawn
and
quartered
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
not
best
of
the
line
but
not
bad
carbonation
instead
of
high
hops
unusual
for
the
line
golden
with
head
beast
bitter
is
a
pretty
good
effort
and
is
a
solid
esb
a
little
more
malt
would
give
the
hops
a
sturdier
springboard
to
bigger
and
better
things
and
is
the
first
change
that
id
make
if
they
let
me
i
cant
wait
to
taste
the
middle
ages
take
on
a
whole
range
of
styles
thanks
to

lightly
carbonated

perhaps
a

grainy

noted
up

thin
malt
to
the
rear
hops
linger
on
the
tongue
through
the
finish
slight
metallic
flavor
note
again
lurks
somewhere
in
this
brew
nothing
super
impressive
here
but
a
middle
of
the
road
passable
ale
true
medium
amber
topped
by
a
fairly
thick
sandy
head
with
a
yellowish
cast
hops
top
the
aroma
and
are
very
fresh
grassy
and
lemony
with
the
lemons
verging
on
cleaning
fluids
but
not
yet
offensive
the
flavor
is
loads
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
apple
especially
the
peels
this
is
an
excellent
bitter
but
i
think
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
a
pleasant
session
worthy
beer
the
ringwood
is
really
starting
to
grow
on
me
pours
a
crisp
looking
orangeamber
colour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
buttery
and
rubbery
at
the
same
time
i
picked
up
some
caramel
and
malt
as
well
not
bad
flavour
is
decent
not
great
but
decent
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
some
earthy
maltiness
and
subtle
sweet
caramel
flavouring
and
finished
with
some
more
bitterness
fairly
simple
overall
but
midly
tasty
this
one
is
fairly
light
and
easy
dirnking
for
the
most
part
but
just
doesnt
do
much
to
separate
itself
from
the
pack
you
can
tell
a
beers
relative
mediocrity
when
one
doesnt
have
much
to
say
about
it
and
i
dont
this
is
certainly
not
the
beast
of
my
good
old
college
days
milwaukees
beast
rather
this
is
wellcrafted
and
balanced
esb
it
pours
a
rich
honeygold
with
a
sticky
light
head
the
first
aroma
to
the
nose
is
its
definitive
hoppiness
followed
by
creamy
butter
notes
but
there
are
present
some
light
ginger
and
citrus
tones
too
the
taste
follows
suit
its
modestly
tart
the
lemony
influence
but
mostly
it
is
yeasty
nor
is
the
bitterness
all
that
profound
even
at
the
finish
but
its
there
in
all
a
straightshooter
of
a
brew
while
the
beast
conjures
images
of
cheap
booze
and
college
parties
lived
through
a
funnel
this
one
certainly
gives
the
beast
a
new
connotation
and
a
much
better
one
at
that
the
color
is
a
hazy
orange
and
the
head
which
starts
small
certainlyl
doesnt
get
any
bigger
in
fact
it
was
gone
in
about
a
minute
leaving
just
a
thin
top
and
ring
smell
is
tons
of
sweet
buttery
popcorn
with
roasted
malts
and
a
tiny
hop
presence
the
taste
is
less
than
i
had
hoped
for
but
its
still
good
i
think
i
need
to
drink
it
less
chiled
next
time
its
a
unpronounced
chalky
nut
flavor
with
definatley
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
not
quite
enough
from
the
hops
the
buttery
malts
come
through
here
too
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
medium
body
with
a
whole
lot
of
small
stinging
bubbles
looks
smell
and
moutfeel
are
good
however
the
taste
which
needs
a
bit
more
to
it
although
it
does
have
a
pleasant
aftertaste
cool
bottle
pours
a
nice
dark
gold
with
a
heavy
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
smells
hoppy
very
carbonated
body
sweet
and
smooth
with
good
hops
quite
drinkable
a
good
beer
but
nothing
particularly
outstanding
fun
to
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again

big
thanks
to
ofs
for
hooking
me
up
with
this

coast
beauty
shop
some
caramel
toffee
notes
appear
as
the
glass
warms
and
more
hops
both
in
the
nose
and
mouth
the
beast
within
the
glass
has
revealed
himself
as
hops
now
coat
my
mouth
and
spar
with
the
malt
be
patient
with
this
stealthy
creature
and
you
will
find
a
fine
example
of
a
bitter
pale
straw
gold
in
color
with
a
bit
of
a
chill
haze
nice
finger
high
head
of
solidly
firm
froth
that
changed
some
as
it
drifted
down
started
whitish
as
a
soft
beigelike
yellow
but
as
it
settled
the
yellow
vanished
and
went
greyish
a
thin
collar
and
broken
thickly
webbed
curtains
of
lace
stick
well
around
most
of
the
glass
aroma
has
a
very
dulled
lemony
citrus
mixed
with
a
grassy
edge
and
just
a
tad
on
the
dry
side
taste
is
a
little
short
lived
mostly
located
mid
palate
to
the
finish
is
where
most
of
the
flavors
decide
to
take
effect
with
a
slight
sharp
grassy
hop
bitterness
with
citrus
and
wood
poking
around
the
edges
malts
come
through
light
but
present
with
a
dryness
of
paper
not
all
that
appetizing
to
me
for
some
reason
it
picks
up
some
strange
notes
of
iced
tea
watery
cola
and
cardboardish
things
as
it
warms
feel
is
alright
i
guess
weakened
front
thin
and
a
tad
watery
but
the
middle
and
finish
gain
some
slight
fullness
and
smudges
of
hopped
bitterness
and
some
light
dryness
fading
off
but
the
thinwatery
feel
seems
to
stay
within
through
out
the
stint
of
each
sip
andor
gulp
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
slightly
better
then
average
for
an
esb
but
not
by
much
in
my
book
the
brew
was
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
big
old
white
head
the
aroma
of
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
different
smells
going
on
the
ones
that
i
can
pick
out
are
citrus
butterscotch
and
a
strong
sense
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
all
about
the
hops
hops
and
more
hops
also
has
some
nice
flavors
of
malt
fruit
and
spice
over
all
a
nice
beer
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
char
pours
an
orange

color
that
is
quite
hazy
and
almost
opeuque
the
head
almost
didnt
exist
there
was
a
clean

smell
with
subtle
hints
of
sweetness
the
taste
was
very
much
on
the
bready
side
with
mild
grain
and
hop
tastes
it
was
also
semi
sweet
the
aftertaste
had
a
bitter
kick
to
it
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
wow
anyone
a
hazy
peach
with
an
impressive
offwhite
white
head
that
sticks
around
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
pineygrassy
hops
and
diacetyl
taste
is
pleasing
and
rather
complex
grassy
and
earthy
hops
that
are
slightly
spicy
a
sweetness
appears
to
be
there
from
the
bready
malt
and
the
buttery
diacetyl
but
the
finish
is
definitely
bitter
feel
is
smooth
with

beer
but
not

and
more
like
an

beer
with

slight

abv
but
somehow
it
feels
more
this
is
very
different
beer
then
most
pale
ales
ive
had
its
darker
than
most
pale
ales
as
well
three
floyds
alpha
king
shares
the
darkness
its
a
lot
heavier
to
drink
than
it
should
be
but
this
brew
just
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
it
just
wasnt
enjoyable
a
very
interesting
slightly
different
apa
to
me
big
malt
quality
with
a
unique
spicy
undertone
something
with
the
hops
hey
its
always
nice
to
find
something
tasty
easily
drinkable
and
somewhat
unique
in
flavor
to
tickle
the
ol
beer
taste
buds
while
definitely
off
the
beaten
path
for
an
american
pale
ale
i
still
think
this
is
good
moerlein
tends
to
take
more
of
the
european
route
with
many
of
the
beers
so
the
flavor
profile
of
this
wasnt
a
total
surprise
truth
be
told
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
english
style
pale
ale
anyway
its
slightly
miscategorized
as
an
american
pale
ale
in
taste
profile
but
nonetheless
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
sessionable
beer
overall
i
do
not
like
this
apa
compared
to
all
the
others
ive
tried
o
a
good
brew
for
a
pale
ale
it
has
some
interesting
taste
characters
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
o
while
this
is
a
very
maltforward
pale
ale
it
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
and
quite
flavorful
for
the
style
the
beer
has
all
the
notes
of
a
standard
apa
but
all
in
all
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
most
apas
its
actually
kind
of
hard
to
pinpoint
though
the
finish
isnt
exactly
what
i
wanted
o
delicious
but
not
so
great
for
the
last
few
sips
just
an
ok
beer
that
i
dont
really
care
about
having
again
avoid
at
all
cost
i
took
two
sips
and
poured
it
out
o
worth
buying
again
i
love
malty
ocktoberfest
beer
this
will
now
join
my
usual
rotation
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
although
not
your
typical
pale
ale
o
there
is
a
good
reason
this
is
christian
moerleins
flagship
ale
as
i
said
with
the
smells
the
beer
seems
like
a
tradition
i
think
this
beer
would
be
more
suitably
classified
under
esb
it
is
certainly
not
pale
in
appearance
and
in
malt
bill
in
the
end
it
is
definitely
a
great
choice
from
a
hometown
brewery
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
slight
amount
of
fruity
malts
in
the
nose
possibly
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
mild
but
relatively
balanced
not
overly
sweet
like
basically
all
of
the
other
offerings
just
a
touch
of
hops
with
biscuit
caramel
malts
i
actually
had
no
idea
this
was
a
pale
ale
when
i
tried
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
lightmedium
carbonation
overall
i
did
say
this
was
my
favorite
but
this
is
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
not
sure
why
they
feel
like
these
beers
need
to
be
so
sweet
this
is
not
like
most
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
style
is
either
wrong
or
brewed
poorly
it
seems
light
enough
to
drink
multiples
of
thats
a
plus
i
would
try
this
again
as
an
extended
tasting
a
12
pack
a
bold
easydrinking
offering
from
cm
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
the
brewery
yet
nice
homage
to
a
neighborhood
deep
in
brewing
history
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
pairs
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
and
at
6
i
can
have
a
few
and
not
be
completely
knocked
off
my
feet
appears
a
clear
copper
hue
with
a
light
off
white
khaki
head
forms
fine
speckled
lacing
evenly
up
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
is
very
tame
with
a
mild
herbalcitric
hop
accent
and
light
caramel
maltiness
flavor
is
dominated
by
sticky
sweet
carmamelized
sugars
that
simply
coat
the
palate
in
a
very
much
ovebearingly
unbalanced
way
the
hop
bite
really
doesnt
make
it
across
because
of
the
extent
of
the
sweetness
of
the
sticky
sweet
caramelized
malts
maybe
in
the
back
end
theres
a
touch
of
herbal
citric
hop
character
but
nothing
pungently
bitter
mouthfeel
may
be
the
worst
part
it
almosts
gags
me
to
gulp
this
down
very
harsh
sticky
unrefined
caramelized
malts
on
the
palate
make
the
whole
experience
unbearable
overall
this
is
a
really
mediocre
example
of
an
apa
and
i
question
that
style
branding
for
a
beer
called
over
the
rhine
bright
copper
ale
with
a
finger
or
so
of
head
that
leaves
wisps
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
dissolves
candied
grapefruit
dominates
the
aroma
also
notice
spices
and
caramel
tastes
of
sweet
grapefruit
caramel
and
bread
the
reasons
that
this
ale
is
a
favorite
among
cincinnatians
are
apparent
this
beer
is
quaffable
but
not
many
the
sweetness
really
hits
a
bit
too
much
but
i
recommend
tasty
and
fairly
solid
but
polar
opposite
of
the
apa
style
that
i
am
used
to
still
growing
on
this
beer
and
trying
to
give
the
local
guys
a
shot
d
4
this
is
a
wellrounded
ale
very
smooth
and
a
good
balanced
aroma
and
taste
it
leaves
me
a
tad
dryer
than
id
prefer
but
a
good
offering
from
moerlein
nonetheless
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
for
sure
one
of
the
best
options
available
at
great
american
ball
park
if
you
have
not
had
this
beer
then
try
it
overall
balanced
towards
the
malty
caramel
side
but
still
a
good
hop
punch
i
really
like
this
beer
i
always
get
it
when
i
go
to
cincinnati
reds
games
a
well
thought
out
beer
with
good
flavor
recommend
with
pork
dishes
and
mellow
cheeses
the
drinkabilty
is
great
on
this
one
would
have
no
trouble
going
through
these
poured
a
delightful
bright
ambercopper
sweet
malt
aroma
very
maltforward
with
moderate
roasted
notes
and
a
touch
of
cerial
sweetness
hopping
was
firm
with
a
subtle
pine
note
nicely
drinkable
a
worthy
effort
other
than
northern
liberties
nothing
from
christian
moerlein
has
knocked
my
socks
off
but
they
are
proving
to
have
a
solid
line
drinkability
this
was
a
nice
little
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
wasnt
sure
what
to
expct
but
i
came
out
satisfied
to
me
this
was
closer
to
an
ipa
than
a
regular
pale
ale
it
was
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
i
would
be
happy
to
pick
this
up
again
this
is
a
good
apa
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
dry
with
a
lot
of
hops
but
not
much
bitterness
the
balance
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
more
an
interesting
hop
bill
with
fuggles
and
cascades
but
the
malt
presence
here
is
a
bit
overbearing
eric
overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
for
apa
the
huge
maltbackbone
lends
plenty
of
sweetness
to
counter
the
hop
spice
but
it
isnt
the
most
balanced
ale
drinkability
this
beer
is
best
when
cold
but
for
me
it
had
a
very
narrow
temperature
window
after
which
i
did
not
care
for
it
so
when
cold
very
drinkable
but
past
that
temperature
it
becomes
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
finish
i
recently
relocated
to
cincinnati
and
found
this
as
a
slightly
more
expensive
alternative
to
macros
at
a
reds
game
when
i
saw
it
in
my
cheap
plastic
cup
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
but
realized
lacing
and
head
are
not
ideally
presented
in
this
situation
what
did
catch
my
taste
buds
was
the
full
body
and
lasting
flavor
in
subsequent
trips
i
have
gone
straight
to
this
vendor
but
unfortunately
was
not
as
impressed
at
home
when
buying
the
bottled
version
good
mouth
for
the
typecarbonation
could
have
a
bit
more
zipa
bit
more
cascade
would
add
some
finish
not
boozyor
real
fillinga
good
workday
beer
the
drinkability
is
good
but
not
one
i
could
see
as
a
session
beer
even
with
its
relatively
low
abv
if
i
were
drinking
apa
i
would
certainly
gravitate
tp
sierra
nevada
in
a
heartbeat
over
this
one
good
effort
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
so
to
speak
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
drinkable
for
sure
the
carbonation
is
going
strong
lending
a
nice
flavorenhancer
across
the
tongue
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
cool
fall
night
or
even
one
for
the
campfire
in
the
early
summer
over
the
rhine
isnt
at
all
what
you
might
expect
from
an
apa
so
i
have
to
dock
some
for
style
however
its
a
good
beer
nonetheless
the
german
influence
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
i
think
worth
a
shot
as
long
as
you
arent
expecting
an
aggressively
hopped
apa
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
all
day
every
day
all
year
long
great
flavors
and
a
nice
sticky
mouthfeel
it
can
be
fillingwarming
and
refreshing
all
at
the
same
time
and
the
moderate
abv
makes
it
perfect
for
getting
through
23
in
a
night
poured
from
a
chilled
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
amber
colored
it
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbles
clinging
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
every
so
often
one
releases
and
rises
to
the
surface
atop
the
beer
is
a
thin
tan
foam
head
that
quickly
disappeared
i
can
now
see
the
rising
bubbles
reach
the
surface
and
pop
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
oaklike
there
is
also
an
aspect
to
it
that
reminds
me
of
cookie
dough
the
beer
is
light
and
malty
at
first
with
a
big
sweet
finish
it
reminds
me
of
melted
chocolate
chips
im
not
sure
the
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
im
afraid
the
bottle
may
have
turned
the
beer
has
a
lighter
body
and
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
a
little
bit
of
coating
but
nothing
significant
im
finding
this
one
a
bit
hard
to
drink
but
as
i
said
above
i
think
this
may
be
a
bad
bottle
ill
have
to
try
another
and
modify
my
review
as
needed
the
body
on
this
crisp
but
its
a
tad
heavy
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
is
much
maltier
than
expected
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
some
tea
and
a
little
charring
on
the
finish
hop
presence
is
surprisingly
absent
bitterness
is
moderate
this
is
odd
i
guess
im
probably
pushing
the
limits
on
the
the
freshness
of
this
bottle
as
springreleases
are
probably
released
in
the
winter
so
i
could
expect
the
hops
to
fade
but
upon
further
inspection
of
other
reviews
this
seems
to
be
the
norm
for
this
beer
i
most
likely
wouldnt
chase
this
one
down
but
it
still
was
an
ok
beer
overalli
was
not
really
pleased
with
this
beer
as
it
does
not
in
my
opinion
adhere
to
the
pale
ale
genre
of
beer
i
have
had
the
moerlein
ipa
and
it
is
much
better
overall
just
too
damn
inconsistent
loved
it
half
the
time
i
spent
drinking
it
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
the
other
half
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
pale
ale
nothing
really
ground
breaking
but
a
solid
apa
all
around
i
would
not
say
no
if
i
stumbled
upon
this
again
over
the
rhine
ale
is
not
christian
moerleins
most
accomplished
ale
and
is
pretty
far
off
the
beaten
path
for
the
apa
style
that
would
be
fine
if
it
tasted
good
but
im
struggling
to
find
anything
that
would
bring
me
back
for
a
second
bottle
md
mouthfeel
is
actually
the
high
point
of
this
beer
very
smooth
and
rich
aka
just
right
this
is
reasonably
drinkable
and
easy
findable
around
cincinnati
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
with
the
green
apple
taste
i
would
not
purchase
it
again
perhaps
my
bottle
came
from
a
batch
with
some
off
flavors
honey
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lace
on
the
glass
this
beer
smells
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
with
an
underlying
faint
fruity
piney
note
toffee
maltiness
with
a
bready
quality
and
some
nice
floral
hop
flavors
to
balance
decent
heft
and
mild
carbonation
make
for
an
easy
drinking
ale
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
an
apa
its
more
like
an
english
pa
this
beer
is
something
different
than
your
typical
pale
ale
i
feel
it
has
a
flavor
closer
to
an
old
alestrong
ale
but
with
a
lower
abv
its
a
good
beer
worth
a
shot
and
favorite
of
many
2
5
d
not
a
big
fan
of
breadiness
in
an
apa
overall
very
drinkable
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
this
is
my
first
from
this
brewery
from
my
first
time
in
cincinnati
and
it
was
a
pretty
nice
offering
drinkability
a
reasonably
decent
quaffable
ale
though
i
will
say
its
the
best
of
the
moerleins
lot
that
ive
had
thus
far
i
will
also
say
thats
not
saying
much
i
would
consider
it
an
esb
though
before
labeling
it
as
an
apa
but
hey
its
a
good
beer
so
who
cares
light
to
medium
body
lower
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
not
overly
exciting
but
not
bad
i
cant
find
any
indication
of
how
old
this
beer
is
and
id
really
love
to
hear
that
its
way
better
fresh
if
i
was
grading
it
as
an
englishstyle
ale
id
rank
it
half
a
point
higher
across
the
board
as
is
this
is
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
beers
to
revisit
d
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
session
beer
or
not
the
experienced
drinker
probably
wouldnt
have
a
problem
putting
away
a
six
pack
but
i
suspect
it
would
get
pretty
filling
overall
a
pretty
unique
interpretation
of
an
apa
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
fairly
mild
version
of
an
apa
balance
is
towards
malt
as
the
hop
bitterness
seems
a
little
too
restrained
for
a
pale
that
said
if
you
judge
it
strictly
as
an
apa
it
falls
short
other
than
that
it
is
a
very
pleasant
enjoyable
beer
smooth
easy
to
drink
certainly
sessionable
needs
more
hop
presence
to
qualify
as
a
decent
apa
but
might
be
a
better
fit
in
another
category
d
i
could
definately
try
this
beer
again
but
was
a
little
let
down
in
the
end
a
good
beer
thats
very
drinkable
but
not
exciting
in
the
flavor
department
thanks
kirok1999
for
the
opportunity
this
beer
is
lack
luster
and
boring
the
bitterness
has
less
bite
then
i
would
like
for
an
apa
a
drying
of
the
palate
and
mouth
hole
in
general
also
displeases
me
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
that
doesnt
really
like
a
strong
aftertaste
or
maybe
someone
that
is
trying
to
develop
their
taste
for
ales
deep
cherry
wood
amber
underneath
a
thin
yet
all
encompassing
film
of
foam
only
a
few
sporadic
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
carameled
crystal
malts
with
just
a
dash
of
citrus
pretty
malty
smelling
apa
sweet
yet
dry
caramel
malts
that
have
a
great
toasted
character
make
up
the
malt
bill
the
hops
give
some
balance
to
the
sweet
bready
flavors
maybe
a
dash
of
mint
julelp
very
clean
malty
palate
and
one
of
the
best
session
apas
ive
ever
had
overall
it
was
an
average
beer
that
is
just
above
a
nonlight
bmc
id
heard
good
things
about
this
one
from
a
friend
but
it
missed
the
mark
for
me
one
and
done
except
that
i
got
3
in
the
box
can
you
say
extras
for
trades
dont
recommend
unless
you
can
get
a
free
taste
just
too
many
other
great
apas
out
there
to
bother
with
this
one
this
was
a
good
ale
while
its
listed
as
a
pale
ale
i
would
say
this
is
more
of
a
straight
malt
ale
that
blended
its
hops
and
malt
nicely
very
solid
beer
overtherhine
is
an
unusual
offering
but
its
quite
solid
and
by
the
end
of
my
glass
im
rather
wishing
this
was
locally
available
a
unique
take
on
a
pale
ale
this
is
good
beer
bottle
from
party
source
the
bottle
had
some
weird
crustys
around
the
cap
after
i
removed
it
so
that
is
not
a
good
sign
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
luminous
orangeamber
color
with
absolutely
no
head
or
lacing
also
not
a
good
sign
light
malt
and
pine
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
and
fruity
with
some
toasted
malt
and
piney
hops
flavor
however
the
flavors
are
buried
by
tartness
the
finish
is
tart
fruit
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
i
have
to
conclude
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
will
need
to
try
again
to
be
sure
poured
an
amber
color
very
clear
with
a
fluffy
creamcolored
head
the
smell
was
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
it
was
sweet
piney
and
buttery
all
at
once
and
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
the
taste
was
excellent
full
of
flavors
but
well
balanced
the
dominant
taste
was
the
malty
flavor
which
was
bready
buttery
and
sweet
and
there
was
a
hop
presence
as
well
which
had
piney
and
citrus
taste
to
is
and
left
a
pinch
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
spicey
linger
the
beer
had
a
smooth
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
all
in
all
this
was
a
great
beer
one
that
i
could
sip
and
savor
yet
still
keep
drinking
plenty
of
it
recommended
smell
is
a
deliciously
citrusy
hop
combined
with
a
sweet
malt
smell
underneath
pours
to
a
bright
reddish
copper
color
with
a
big
bubble
head
that
disappears
quickly
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
without
too
much
hopping
evident
at
the
start
then
building
in
the
middle
to
the
end
where
a
bullion
like
bitterness
comes
through
the
bitterness
is
not
sharp
but
earthy
not
much
cascade
like
taste
as
anticipated
from
the
smell
very
different
i
dont
really
think
it
is
balanced
as
they
state
it
is
more
complex
definitely
quaffable
though
theyre
on
the
money
with
this
one
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
although
it
tastes
more
like
an
esb
its
good
though
so
whos
arguing
d
a
highly
drinkable
ale
although
i
think
it
fits
a
little
better
into
the
esb
or
english
pale
ale
category
a
quality
brew
with
an
interesting
blend
of
both
english
malt
and
american
hops
influences
12
oz
bottle
from
beer
of
the
month
club
copper
pour
with
a
large
off
white
head
nose
of
citrus
and
malt
aroma
taste
of
apples
citrus
hops
malt
and
faint
spices
really
mild
finish
definately
one
that
would
pair
well
with
food
or
for
a
session
brew
my
only
concern
is
that
for
a
pale
ale
i
think
it
should
have
a
stronger
hop
presence
both
in
flavor
and
aroma
i
could
drink
anywhere
between
one
and
eight
of
these
one
is
going
great
with
some
indian
cuisine
right
now
but
this
one
could
also
be
a
good
session
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
inch
of
head
forming
on
the
pour
really
looks
good
in
the
glass
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
but
mostly
bready
malts
are
present
taste
is
very
biscuity
bready
malts
crisp
and
tasty
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
offering
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
a
hazy
copper
colored
body
hosts
a
one
inch
fuzzy
light
tan
head
that
fades
in
minutes
leaving
almost
no
lace
nose
is
a
nice
soft
mix
of
sweet
malt
marmalade
and
syrupy
maltiness
thick
citrus
rind
notes
enter
the
mouth
with
some
mineral
based
maltiness
and
a
healthy
dose
of
woodsy
almost
piney
hops
all
on
first
sip
this
flavor
porfile
is
very
unique
as
it
really
shows
some
complexity
and
flare
really
dont
konw
where
this
falls
rye
ale
pale
ale
wheat
maybe
all
in
one
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
very
pleasant
would
make
a
very
good
summer
beer
nicely
drinkable
d
the
amount
of
carameltoffee
taste
has
the
potential
to
grow
tiresome
but
this
one
is
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
brownishred
beauty
is
a
great
beer
for
any
weather
and
season
it
doesnt
form
much
of
a
head
or
cling
to
the
glass
very
well
but
the
distinctive
color
especially
for
an
apa
is
delightful
the
sweet
malty
nose
carries
this
brew
onto
the
palate
where
the
fullbodied
malt
is
joined
and
balanced
by
a
complex
hoppy
note
that
carries
all
the
way
beyond
the
finish
into
a
pleasant
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
unusually
thick
almost
jammy
and
smooth
for
an
apa
it
is
a
nice
beer
in
warmer
weather
but
will
be
even
more
drinkable
in
those
early
autumn
days
when
the
warming
character
of
its
6
abv
and
somewhat
higher
gravity
would
perfectly
balance
its
modestly
carbonated
hoppy
overtones
in
any
season
it
would
be
refreshing
and
drinkable
heres
another
interesting
and
tasty
brew
from
christian
moerlein
im
very
happy
that
i
decided
to
seek
some
out
worth
a
try
thanks
to
pimpp
for
the
sample
amber
color
with
a
frothy
head
and
some
prickle
it
has
a
hoppy
nose
that
is
very
pleasant
and
i
would
say
just
about
right
crisp
and
clean
attack
with
late
presenting
hops
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
but
clean
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
some
faint
lemony
notes
i
would
call
it
a
b
decently
quaffable
d
good
session
beer
real
easy
to
drink
the
watchwords
are
basic
balance
and
blending
and
the
result
is
very
enjoyable
with
just
enough
complexity
but
not
too
much
to
make
it
busy
it
speaks
of
care
and
attention
to
detail
its
smooth
satisfying
and
it
goes
down
especially
easily
i
drink
it
and
i
think
of
old
world
brewing
pride
and
passion
its
a
session
beer
that
anyone
purist
or
otherwise
can
find
pleasing
d
a
tasty
beer
very
quaffable
but
a
bit
ordinary
i
like
the
flavor
it
has
just
wish
it
had
more
of
it
thanks
brewdlyhooked13
for
this
fine
ale
i
would
not
have
pegged
this
as
a
pale
ale
but
whatever
it
is
it
is
pretty
darn
good
the
flavor
is
a
complete
surprise
after
the
fresh
vibrant
hoppy
nose
i
wish
the
balance
of
up
front
hop
and
supporting
malt
had
been
carried
through
to
the
flavor
instead
the
flavor
is
just
way
unbalanced
with
this
way
underattenuated
malt
character
thanks
to
pimpp
for
this
thanks
to
pimpp
for
letting
me
get
a
taste
i
was
happy
to
see
an
ale
introduced
by
moerlein
so
i
had
to
try
this
beer
poured
an
amber
brownish
color
with
a
light
color
head
the
smell
is
of
nice
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
the
taste
brings
much
maltiness
and
not
enough
hops
for
my
liking
for
an
apa
d
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
would
want
everyday
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
enjoyed
my
first
by
this
brewery
overall
this
was
not
bad
at
all
i
could
have
thrown
this
down
all
night
but
i
stopped
to
go
upstairs
to
my
room
and
crack
a
double
bastard
but
still
this
was
definite
quality
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
anyday
nice
offering
from
cincinnat
having
grown
up
in
the
town
its
a
pleasure
to
see
this
old
staple
come
back
a
wellrounded
beer
and
would
gladly
enjoy
again
would
a
good
session
choice
d
great
tasting
and
very
sessionable
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
and
i
love
bringing
this
to
poker
games
and
having
other
want
to
try
it
overall
like
candy
i
could
drink
and
drink
this
til
i
got
sick
final
thought
this
to
me
was
a
hybrid
apadoppelbock
the
balance
of
malts
and
hops
were
about
equal
and
very
complementary
a
fantastic
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
beer
that
would
be
good
to
drink
for
the
duration
of
an
evening
i
could
certainly
drink
several
of
these
a
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
about
a
quater
inch
high
but
quickly
dissolves
away
carbonation
is
strongly
visible
in
the
glass
the
sweet
scent
of
malt
comes
out
along
with
bread
and
fruity
esters
at
the
end
that
sweetness
comes
out
in
the
flavor
it
stays
with
you
till
almost
the
very
end
when
when
a
mild
smck
of
bitterness
crosses
the
palate
the
medium
bodied
feel
starts
at
the
front
of
each
taste
but
thins
out
as
it
reaches
the
back
of
the
palate
a
strong
offering
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
brewery
solid
flavor
make
this
a
good
go
to
beer
when
nothing
can
be
found
plus
a
good
cross
over
beer
to
get
macro
drinkers
to
try
this
certainly
more
complex
and
fullbodied
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
keep
thinking
i
am
drinking
a
quality
more
accented
esb
overall
i
am
really
impressed
by
this
ale
wonderful
job
and
an
excellent
value
at
5
99
a
6pack
would
never
have
put
this
beer
in
the
pale
ale
catagory
but
this
wont
keep
me
from
rating
this
beer
highly
it
a
good
beer
the
pour
brings
a
typical
pale
ale
look
with
a
more
tightyly
knit
carbonation
promising
creaminess
and
maltyness
the
smells
bring
out
a
lot
of
soft
malt
aromas
with
some
english
hops
flavor
prove
that
maltiness
prevails
but
with
a
crisp
northern
brewer
hop
flavor
which
proved
to
be
very
fresh
and
palate
cleansing
the
beers
flavor
never
reached
compexity
but
stays
pure
clean
and
crisp
nothing
to
fault
here
only
a
mild
astringency
could
play
a
part
in
lower
ratings
agreed
that
this
beer
resembles
esb
proportions
and
character
this
may
c
m
s
best
brew
a
great
counterpart
to
a
lot
of
the
oktoberfest
beers
comming
up
ill
certainly
have
my
share
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
very
good
medium
body
the
beer
has
full
flavors
and
doesnt
punk
out
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
killing
a
sixer
of
this
no
problem
a
dam
fine
brew
from
a
resurgent
moerlein
12
ounce
bottle
bought
from
belmont
party
supply
dayton
oh
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
thick
one
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
very
good
a
nice
aroma
mostly
grassyfloral
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
sweet
malt
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
but
theres
more
of
a
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
in
the
taste
not
that
im
complaining
good
full
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
rich
and
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
great
session
beer
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
lately
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
drinkable
apa
with
good
balance
christian
moerleins
overtherhine
ale
is
a
great
choice
drinkability
this
is
on
the
short
list
for
constant
supply
in
my
fridge
this
is
my
new
goto
beer
good
job
cm
on
the
otr
get
some
if
you
can
what
a
wonderful
suprise
i
had
when
i
opened
this
beer
for
the
first
time
the
aroma
was
perfect
and
it
poured
very
well
with
a
thin
head
i
love
drinking
ales
and
i
really
loved
drinking
this
one
the
taste
was
so
smooth
a
nice
balance
a
treat
i
hope
all
will
be
able
to
enjoy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
creamy
and
full
bodied
they
dont
get
much
better
than
this
carbonation
is
in
check
lower
levels
with
finer
bubbles
dont
get
in
the
way
of
the
flavor
and
feel
of
this
brew
this
is
a
brew
id
definitely
buy
again
however
im
always
looking
for
something
new
so
it
might
be
awhile
i
picked
up
and
split
with
my
brother
a
6
of
this
the
weekend
after
it
was
released
and
now
im
wishing
id
gotten
another
6
not
quite
as
hoppy
but
a
little
maltier
and
considerably
darker
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
its
probably
my
new
favorite
pale
ale
a
nice
addition
to
the
christian
moerlein
line
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
out
during
the
official
first
tapping
at
the
makeshift
brewpub
christian
moerlein
set
up
at
findley
market
this
was
a
very
tasty
adult
beverage
it
was
very
malty
in
my
opinion
and
that
is
a
good
thing
it
has
a
nice
aroma
and
a
lasting
aftertaste
my
wife
did
not
like
it
much
but
what
does
she
know
abour
beer
anyway
hehe
overall
a
welcome
beer
to
the
christian
moerlein
stable
drinkability
a
fineflavored
brew
with
plenty
of
session
potential
went
very
well
with
some
chipotle
chow
chips
salsa
on
cinco
de
mayo
impressive
offering
from
cm
their
craftiest
beer
yet
the
folks
at
oktoberfest
will
love
this
in
the
fall
very
nice

overall
a
really
nice

ale
ive
come
to
appreciate
goose
island
for
their
balance
and
subtlety
rather
than
nailing
you
over
the
head
with
expeditious
overpowered
concoctions
and
this
ale
doesnt
disappoint
extremely
tasty
hopmalt
balance
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
knock
these
back
all
night
o
this
is
like
an
ipa
in
training
if
there
was
ever
a
hopheads
session
beer
this
would
be
it
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
for
straddling
the
divide
and
leaning
toward
the
hoppy
end
of
the
esb
english
pale
ale
style
like
it
a
lot
if
it
had
been
labeled
as
an
ipa
that
wouldve
been
a
good
description
and
id
say
it
meets
the
same
chemical
after
twinge
as
the
majority
of
massproduced
average
ipas
easy
drinking
spicily
hopped
give
it
a
try
overall
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
an
excellent
offering
lots
of
good
hops
aroma
flavor
and
with
a
sweet
malty
body
to
keep
it
all
together
a
easy
4
255
and
personally
give
it
a
91100
hope
that
the
rest
of
goose
islands
stock
beers
can
come
out
like
this
o
ive
had
harvest
ale
before
from
goose
island
but
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
i
really
appreciate
the
classic
take
on
classic
styles
while
goose
island
can
blow
you
away
with
some
of
their
more
creative
ales
they
also
really
do
extremely
well
crafting
great
beer
in
the
somewhat
forgotten
styles
harvest
ale
is
perfect
for
the
fall
season
and
i
am
almost
greatly
appreciative
that
we
get
a
wider
variety
of
goose
island
brews
here
at
home
ill
buy
a
pack
of
this
every
single
autumn
its
one
of
the
best
esbs
ever
created
no
more
to
say
try
it
this
is
a
good
beer
from
goose
island
and
while
not
much
like
other
harvest
ales
it
is
still
good
in
its
own
way
the
body
is
medium
and
the
beer
is
easier
drinking
than
other
examples
of
its
style
which
are
often
a
little
too
bitter
goose
island
harvest
succeeded
in
locating
a
good
balance
for
this
style
and
it
is
easily
one
of
the
brewerys
better
products
the
verdict
not
bad
a
well
balanced
beer
that
goes
along
well
with
a
crisp
fall
day
a
good
solid
brew
othe
balance
of
the
beer
was
great
not
too
much
hops
or
too
much
sweetness
nothing

about

i
may
change
some
of
the
review
points
when
i
have
finished
the
sixer
overall
an
interesting
and
tasty
brew
but
lacking
in
the
malt
department
for
the
style
overall
this
is
an
okay
harvest
ale
nothing
bad
but
nothing
really
blows
me
away
o
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this

i
can
again
a
really
nice

pretty
decent
beer
a
little
no
a
lot
more

than
i
was
expecting
and
even
prefer

heads
should
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
im
glad
i
had
it
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
overall
an
average
to
good
harvest
ale
that
provides
enough
hop
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
if
i
was
rating
strictly
to
style
itd
be
much
worse
so
pass
if
youre
looking
for
a
traditional
esb
with
that
said
its
worth
a
shot
very
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
but
nothing
special
overall
i
was
surprised
by
the
very
good
rating
even
though
i
agree
it
is
indeed
very
good
because
its
an
anheuserbusch
product
produced
at
their
baldwinsville
ny
plant
and
unfortunately
that
sometimes
skews
people
ratings
this
however
is
not
an
adjunct
lager
by
any
means
its
tasty
put
together
well
not
mind
blowing
but
decent
you
need
to
try
this
as
proof
that
a
macro
can
actually
make
good
beer
if
they
just
try
thanks
mike
for
the
great
fall
offering
the
taste
is
great
lots
of
herbal
piney
hop
flavors
meld
well
with
the
mild
caramel
from
the
malt
with
a
nice
mild
caramel
accent
lending
a
balanced
quality
with
the
slight
grapefruit
essencefrom
the
hops
mild
spice
and
mellow
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
even
though
this
may
be
more
intense
the
usual
for
the
style
it
is
still
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beyond
my
expectations
o
overall
goose
island
created
a
great
seasonal
here
this
one
screams
fall
and
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
as
the
weather
begins
to
change
pours
a
dark
copper
tone
with
a
fingerwidth
beige
head
notes
of
grains
floral
hops
and
touch
of
metallic
notes
on
the
finish
crisp
and
clean
easy
on
the
palate
nothing
to
note
really
here
nice
dry
bittering
flavor
start
this
off
typical
for
the
style
light
fruity
quality
some
semisweet
grains
with
a
lingering
bitter
pull
on
the
palate
at
its
finish
nice
simple
beer
here
thats
a
decent
break
away
from
the
typical
marzens
of
the
fall
brewed
and
bottled
by
goose
island
beer
co
in
baldwinsville
ny
okay
i
guess
they
are
doing
some
contract
brewing
in
baldwinsville
ny
or
ab
is
brewing
at
one
of
their
locations
to
increase
production
regardless
the
beer
in
this
bottle
is
good
so
far
heres
some
more

giving
perfect

to
my
first
few
sniffs
striking

freely
through
with

a
nice
smooth
level

with

roasted
specialty
grains
under
8
bucks
a
sixer
and
readily
available
now
due
to
the
ab
distribution
network
i
was
nervous
to
try
this
seasonal
because
the
12
packs
brewed
in
ny
were
not
matching
up
this
summer
this
however
shows
promise
for
future
endeavors
and
specialty
releases
not
brewed
in
chicago
the
oktoberfest
i
get
in
ohio
says
brewed
and
bottled
in
chicago
il
its
stellar
this
year
i
havent
had
one
brewed
in
baldwinsville
ny
to
compare
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
smooth
even
carbonation
slightly
slick
hop
oils
glide
across
the
palate
this
pairs
well
with
pizza
meat
and
cheese
trays
steaks
and
just
about
anything
a
very
versatile
well
brewed
harvest
ale
esb
that
should
be
sessioned
and
enjoyed
by
all
price
point
is
right
quality
is
on
par
its
going
to
be
a
great
stand
by
this
fall
season
great
stuff
passed
on
the
sixer
for
weeks
now
and
im
hoping
they
still
have
some
left
enjoyed
this
beer
but
in
my
opinion
acts
and
feels
more
like
an
i
p
a
pours
out
a
copper
body
with
not
much
head
smell
a
lot
of
crystal
malt
a
lot
of
toast
pretty
big
citrus
hit
in
the
nose
taste
is
light
in
the
malt
flavor
but
fairly
heavy
on
the
sweetness
theres
some
good
balancing
bitterness
but
the
citrus
and
herbal
combination
of
the
hops
kind
of
clashes
carbonation
is
pretty
prickly
the
big
sweetness
and
fairly
jarring
bitterness
doesnt
work
for
me
in
this
autumn
amber
in
color
with
a
fizzy
sticky
2
finger
head
that
settles
to
a
sticky
soapy
foam
on
top
citrus
and
floral
aromas
wonderful
balance
between
hops
and
malts
in
the
flavor
i
dont
know
why
i
love
this
beer
so
much
nothing
really
stands
out
but
its
the
perfect
combination
of
flavors
that
make
this
beer
great
for
any
season
nice
crisp
mouth
feel
overall
great
beer
where
one
is
simply
not
enough
great
session
beer
to
welcome
the
fall
season
overall
a
great
fall
beer
definitely
would
have
again
hard
to
know
exactly
why
but
this
beer
does
remind
me
of
fall
it
just
has
the
look
and
overall
character
of
a
fall
beer
it
does
go
down
pretty
easy
although
is
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
for
my
tastes
there
is
enough
balance
to
keep
the
hops
from
overwhelming
the
taste
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
toned
down
ipa
not
a
bad
beer
but
with
my
personal
tastes
would
prefer
a
bit
more
malt
and
a
little
less
hops
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
tea
citrus
and
floral
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
slight
floral
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
brew
to
welcome
cool
autumn
with
o
a
fresh
take
on
autumn
brews
and
done
pretty
well
everything
is
balanced
pretty
well
and
the
that
undefinable
something
in
the
aroma
is
both
intriguing
and
intoxicating
just
not
sure
how
well
it
matches
this
time
of
year
i
think
warm
spicesmalts
not
hops
maybe
pick
up
a
case
and
age
it
til
mid
june
this
ale
starts
out
with
promise
but
ultimately
falls
short
despite
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hops
the
overall
flavor
isnt
very
intriguing
and
i
feel
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
before
ive
even
finished
the
glass
o
id
like
some
more
of
a
malt
backbone
in
this
beer
its
comes
off
as
a
too
light
in
malt
flavor
with
a
little
too
much
hop
bitterness
because
of
it
however
it
is
easy
drinking
a
good
beer
its
just
not
amazing
o
it
tastes
very
similar
to
a
regular
goose
island
ipa
with
just
a
hint
of
an
burnt
autumn
taste
overall
some
roast
some
sweet
and
some
hop
all
melding
very
nicely
a
rather
enjoyable
esb
a
solid
harvest
ale
although
not
as
hopcentric
as
i
would
personally
choose
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
clear
coppered
amber
colour
that
near
glows
it
has
a
respectable
offwhite
head
that
lingers
for
a
respectable
length
of
time
aroma
is
maltforward
as
suitable
for
the
listed
esb
style
although
not
what
id
hoped
for
in
an
american
harvest
ale
it
has
a
decent
caramelized
malt
graininess
and
breadth
the
flavour
also
showcases
the
malt
spectrum
with
a
bittering
hop
presence
that
lingers
into
the
finish
few
of
the
citrus
or
tropical
fruit
hop
notes
for
which
id
hoped
but
still
a
decently
bitter
beer
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
worth
checking
out
overall
fine
for
what
it
is
and
it
is
a
very
light
tasting
esb
which
makes
for
easy
drinking
a
ver
nicely
balanced
mild
wonderful
british
malt
character
with
a
nice
splash
of
american
hops
as
a
prior
reviewer
says
would
go
great
with
a
meal
do
this
beer
is
a
bold
hybrid
american
amber
ale
that
manages
to
cultivate
some
traditional
english
qualities
appropriately
maltfocused
it
is
unapologetic
in
the
way
it
does
not
try
to
subdue
or
conceal
the
full
force
of
its
flavor
qualities
while
repetitive
by
itself
this
beer
would
be
good
company
for
a
savory
meal
the
only
knock
is
in
the
body
a
bit
watery
before
developing
a
seriously
sticky
coating
of
the
upper
palate
and
back
of
the
tongue
medium
bodied
at
best
lightly
effervescent
slightly
drying
with
a
citrusy
note
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
quite
appealing
good
stuff
o
a
really
nice
fall
seasonal
malty
and
yet
slightly
hoppy
and
crisp
and
perfect
for
the
changing
of
the
seasons
yet
another
dandy
by
gi
goose
island
harvest
ale
35
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
frothy
head
which
lasted
was
tan
in
color
with
good
lacing
color
was
a
clear
copper
amber
hue
and
aroma
was
malty
and
sweet
taste
was
malty
and
sweet
with
caramel
notes
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
with
the
aftertaste
having
a
hoppy
slightly
bitter
character
o
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
id
pick
a
lot
of
other
seasonal
beers
over
this
od
something
that
can
get
a
nice
hop
fix
with
an
abv
under
6
00
for
a
widely
distributed
beer
its
a
good
six
pack
to
pick
up
and
drink
for
the
dayevening
this
harvest
ale
could
easily
make
for
a
session
beer
as
long
as
one
takes
their
time
it
is
also
a
better
alternative
during
a
tailgate
party
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
you
get
a
decent
amount
of
maltiness
in
the
harvest
there
isnt
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
this
would
be
a
good
choice
for
an
oktoberfest
party
overall
2
55
i
was
very
unimpressed
maybe
i
just
had
an
old
bottle
but
the
beer
was
very
bitter
and
was
not
well
balanced
this
beer
is
clear
amber
orange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
nose
doesnt
do
much
for
the
beer
but
does
light
compliment
the
taste
the
beer
is
quite
hop
forward
for
an
esb
a
bit
of
pine
and
pineapple
an
abundance
of
lemon
and
lemongrass
flavors
from
the
hops
the
malt
backbone
is
non
offensive
and
rather
light
its
quite
sugary
and
has
a
slight
bit
of
grainyness
overall
this
is
decent
fresh
hop
ale
doesnt
stick
out
from
the
rest
but
will
make
for
a
fine
drinking
brew
for
a
nice
price
the
beer
is
transparent
and
copper
hued
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
brings
biscuity
malt
caramel
subtle
alcohol
and
spice
the
flavor
is
ok
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
with
a
sturdy
malt
bill
leading
the
way
residual
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
pine
it
certainly
tastes
english
in
style
but
i
do
prefer
most
brit
offerings
to
this
lacking
the
delectable
character
and
drinkability
i
look
for
in
a
fairly
low
abv
beer
overall
this
is
ok
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
it
again
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
there
are
some
very
enjoyable
notes
of
hops
along
with
the
toasted
malts
a
nice
fall
seasonal
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tall
500ml
glass
pours
a
nice
red
amber
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
and
choco
really
pleasant
taste
a
little
dark
roasted
malt
but
also
some
nice
hop
bite
beer
is
perfectly
carbonated
for
its
light
body
and
finishes
really
well
overall
an
excellent
beer
reviewed
by
beth
over
all
good
not
great
easy
drinking
and
would
make
for
a
good
sixer
to
drink
on
a
fall
day
watching
football
i
wouldnt
but
this
one
again
but
mainly
because
im
not
a
fan
of
bitter
beers
in
general
for
those
of
you
that
are
this
is
probably
a
nice
mild
one
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
like
to
drink
it
again
and
again
overall
this
was
a
highly
flavorful
highly
drinkable
fall
brew
superb
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
sessionable
pick
some
up
o
i
think
this
is
my
first
esb
and
while
it
isnt
a
style
that
blows
me
away
i
could
see
drinking
this
offering
again
m
medium
bodied
but
drinks
really
easy
o
an
above
average
esb
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
body
and
a
smoother
finish
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
honestly
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
in
the
fall
there
are
just
so
many
excellent
brews
this
time
of
year
which
of
course
is
a
good
thing
this
is
kind
of
middle
of
the
pack
a
hazy
amber
ale
that
pours
with
a
light
fluffy
head
it
has
fruity
nose
with
some
orange
in
particular
and
maybe
a
touch
of
candied
ginger
i
love
the
fresh
leafy
cascade
hoppiness
of
this
ale
i
love
how
the
candy
corn
sweetness
mixes
with
fruitiness
imparted
by
the
yeast
and
citrus
and
pine
hoppiness
this
beer
starts
out
hoppy
and
ends
hoppy
but
with
a
hard
candy
dollop
of
sweetness
right
at
the
end
a
hoppy
esb
but
not
that
bitter
at
just
38
ibus
o
a
very
welldone
harvest
ale
by
goose
island
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
every
year
now
that
dc
gets
goose
island
distro
oone
i
would
drink
again
with
the
proper
accompanying
food
the
more
that
i
drink
this
the
more
that
i
want
pretzels
o
im
taken
aback
by
how
sweet
this
beer
is
as
an
esb
this
is
a
pretty
disappointing
beer
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
little
bitter
for
my
tastes
but
still
good
beer
o
this
is
an
excellent
fall
beer
the
slight
bitterness
adds
just
the
right
amount
of
bite
to
the
malty
profile
it
is
also
one
of
the
nicest
beers
i
have
seen
presentation
wise
i
am
almost
finished
with
the
glass
and
it
still
has
a
nice
cap
overall
worth
at
least
trying
especially
before
it
gets
too
cold
outside
as
a
session
beer
this
would
easily
suffice
even
though
its
a
bit
strong
to
be
categorized
as
one
this
wont
blow
anyone
over
but
like
so
many
of
goose
islands
other
offerings
its
nice
to
have
this
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
its
a
welcome
change
from
the
other
fall
beers
that
are
currently
available
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
to
it
combines
features
of
earthy
hops
lightly
toasted
and
caramel
malts
and
bready
biscuity
flavors
in
a
highly
balanced
whole
freshness
im
sure
plays
a
role
but
great
beer
all
the
same
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
overall
not
anything
that
i
was
expecting
but
also
that
was
part
of
what
made
it
unique
and
enjoyable
lots
of
other
harvest
ales
id
rather
have
but
this
one
definitely
occupies
its
own
place
in
harvest
ale
history
o
a
very
nice
tasty
esb
hits
all
the
marks
for
the
style
a
winner
from
goose
island
and
another
one
of
those
beers
that
amazes
me
with
its
availability
and
consistency
great
choice
for
a
fall
seasonal
i
love
that
i
can
buy
it
in
a
12pack
m
medium
smooth
a
bit
fizzy
but
nothing
to
whine
about
overall
a
little
disappointed
maybe
if
i
had
it
fresher
the
hops
would
be
more
prominent
not
a
terrible
beer
but
a
let
down
and
not
really
my
style
decent
head
and
pours
well
appearance
is
nice
and
taste
is
good
hoppy
with
a
fair
finish
for
an
autumn
harvest
ale
it
ranks
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
flavor
is
good
and
it
is
not
too
heavy
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
good
barbecue
or
steak
goose
island
did
well
with
this
beer
overall
otoo
malty
for
my
taste
the
hops
very
nice
but
the
malt
was
too
much
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
balance
of
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
hop
presence
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
that
provides
some
lingering
dry
bitterness
this
is
countered
by
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
buttery
diacetyl
before
a
slightly
dry
finish
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
i
found
if
pretty
boring
and
mediocre
overall
a
decent
if
not
forgettable
harvest
beer
its
a
good
brew
to
down
a
sixer
of
on
a
late
september
friday
night
on
the
deck
nothing
to
wow
me
but
nothing
offensive
o
its
a
decent
brew
nothing
to
brag
about
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
subtle
characters
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
so
if
your
looking
for
something
that
is
more
dynamic
this
might
not
be
the
one
for
you
however
it
is
a
nice
introductory
brew
to
the
fallseason
brews
for
those
who
are
just
staring
out
in
the
craftmicro
brew
world
quite
good
o
the
abv
keeps
it
out
of
sessioning
range
but
this
is
a
good
pair
with
food
or
drink
a
six
pack
because
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
on
a
sunday
afternoon
damnit
kind
of
beer
dont
expect
anything
mindblowing
but
its
incredibly
solid
nonetheless
quite
good
worth
grabbing
some
a
lot
of
english
maltiness
going
on
has
a
dry
hopped
sort
of
taste
somewhat
astringent
but
not
too
much
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
a
deep
burnt
copper
color
with
a
very
sturdy
white
layer
of
bubbles
on
top
and
respectable
lacing
the
aroma
sends
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
brown
bread
and
mild
grass
hops
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
slightly
skunky
herbal
hopped
malt
with
a
nutmegturnip
spice
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
smooth
yet
tingly
feel
finely
carbonated
and
finishing
with
a
delicate
hint
of
dryness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
spicey
sort
of
esb
with
a
tasteful
hop
edge
a
great
fall
treat
for
the
long
haul
close
to
two
fingers
of
loose
frothy
foam
mild
dimpling
as
it
settles
down
strong
retention
across
the
surface
the
lacing
is
not
very
broad
however
displays
good
stickiness
clear
copper
brown
in
color
with
a
few
trace
bubbles
lazily
rising
more
of
a
yellow
cast
around
the
rims
in
the
nose
you
get
pretzel
dough
salt
and
miscellaneous
bread
crust
then
honey
cocoa
malts
peach
pits
and
lemon
rinds
oddly
neither
sweet
nor
grassy
like
it
doesnt
want
to
commit
to
a
specific
direction
slightly
better
than
average
staying
power
mediumbodied
its
firmness
creates
additional
palate
presence
malts
cocoa
caramel
honey
yet
not
that
sweet
the
carbonation
is
subtle
but
effective
scrubs
the
tongue
well
the
lemon
citrus
brings
out
more
earthiness
and
likely
more
pit
aspect
to
the
apricot
peach
apple
fig
fruit
the
well
baked
bread
never
a
major
factor
just
one
of
many
drying
elements
leaves
you
wishing
it
showed
more
exuberant
personality
not
that
its
playing
it
safely
but
you
just
sense
it
could
have
been
more
complex
with
some
effort
o
a
good
fall
beer
that
falls
under
the
category
of
an
easy
fall
drinker
that
isnt
either
an
octoberfest
or
pumpkin
beer
solid
poured
from
a
bottle
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
deep
burnt
orange
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
offwhite
colored
head
aromas
of
pumpkin
sweetness
both
rich
and
creamy
with
some
very
subtle
spicing
to
accent
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spicing
that
doesnt
come
anywhere
close
to
cleaning
this
thing
up
tangy
bitter
overtones
throughout
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
background
this
beer
is
getting
more
muddled
the
more
i
drink
unbalanced
aftertaste
as
well
with
a
roasty
spiced
and
cloyingly
sweet
character
slick
slightly
bitter
finish
but
there
is
a
filmy
sweetness
that
lingers
behind
not
good
o
a
pleasant
esb
brewed
with
citrusy
american
hops
with
what
was
probably
fresh
wet
hops
the
astringency
might
be
avoided
by
using
a
high
alpha
hops
this
was
brewed
by
ab
because
i
know
goose
island
didnt
build
a
brewery
there
but
it
looks
like
goose
island
still
has
a
good
hold
on
controlling
the
recipe
as
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
id
expect
from
them
medium
body
decent
carbonation
crisp
and
slick
on
the
tongue
its
nice
to
see
something
other
than
some
sort
of
pale
ale
during
the
harvest
season
although
this
was
barely
above
average
for
me
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
deep
orange
color
the
head
was
an
average
size
and
white
in
color
the
retention
was
pretty
good
on
this
beer
as
well
as
the
lacing
in
the
beginning
not
much
nearing
the
end
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
some
caramel
notes
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
moderate
roasted
sweetness
up
front
that
finishes
bitter
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
a
little
over
carbonated
i
think
the
beer
was
still
very
drinkable
though
overall
i
think
the
bitterness
was
a
little
too
high
but
all
in
all
its
still
a
solid
brew
o
very
well
balanced
not
much
for
aroma
and
flavor
but
very
drinkable
none
the
less
slightly
soapy
at
first
sour
citric
fruit
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
touch
of
banana
strangely
cinnamon
raised
bread
with
touches
of
caramel
some
toasted
grain
very
balanced
and
smooth
but
the
flavors
dont
all
meld
together
layers
of
strangeness
that
arent
offensive
but
just
dont
seem
to
work
full
body
interesting
but
i
just
feel
the
flavors
arent
melding
properly
oda
bit
let
down
i
think
i
was
expecting
too
much
here
its
very
very
solid
but
i
wanted
a
bit
more
hop
variety
and
intensity
still
i
am
not
upset
but
my
purchase
of
a
6pack
neither
the
malts
nor
the
hops
really
jumped
out
but
rather
coexisted
so
that
there
was
a
balance
of
flavors
it
was
nice
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
was
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
and
a
pretty
nice
beer
overall
o
a
nice
ale
but
i
feel
like
it
could
have
used
more
kick
in
the
flavot
an
easy
to
find
and
nicely
price
ale
makes
it
drinkable
along
with
the
low
abv
well
done
all
around
not
extraordinary
but
another
solid
beer
from
goose
island
baste
your
turkey
in
this
and
you
wont
regret
it
overall
different
take
on
a
harvest
beer
malt
elements
are
there
with
the
hops
and
bitters
of
an
ale
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
very
good
offering
notes
goose
islands
harvest
ale
proves
not
all
fall
seasonals
are
sprinkled
with
pantry
spices
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
goose
island
and
this
one
is
very
good
the
beer
definitely
reminds
of
autumn
and
has
nice
flavors
that
are
balanced
well
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
its
a
hoppier
take
on
a
harvest
ale
compared
to
what
ive
experienced
from
other
breweries
id
enjoy
having
this
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
a
little
bite
on
the
tongue
with
each
sip
overall
a
decent
brew
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
that
is
overly
impressive
or
blows
me
away
not
a
bad
brew
i
was
expecting
more
of
the
butterscotch
and
leathery
traits
i
find
in
most
english
versions
of
the
esb
genre
it
is
interesting
from
goose
island
who
i
find
to
be
right
on
in
specific
styles
and
miss
with
others
too
bad
they
are
macro
now
poured
into
my
new
lagunitas
mason
jar
small
topping
of
offwhite
head
fizzles
down
slowly
but
sticks
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
deep
copper
hues
in
the
body
of
the
ale
aromas
are
piney
hops
herbal
and
a
far
away
backdrop
of
caramel
malt
i
was
hoping
the
hops
would
dominate
in
flavor
here
and
they
most
definitely
do
bready
malt
is
present
just
enough
to
balance
out
the
herbal
smack
of
hops
and
the
toasted
biscuit
really
comes
out
with
a
bit
of
warmth
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
beer
and
id
definitely
have
another
sometimes
less
than
great
hits
the
spot
this
is
a
real
nice
bitter
brings
some
very
good
depth
and
flavor
on
both
the
aromas
and
flavors
with
a
nice
toffee
finish
o
not
a
bad
esb
the
flavor
was
better
than
the
aroma
however
tastes
wellbalanced
with
a
biscuity
malt
profile
at
first
followed
by
a
hoppy
sharp
bitter
finish
very
good
and
a
welcome
break
from
the
usual
fall
marzenoktoberfest
styles
this
one
reminds
me
a
lot
of
zombie
dust
i
have
to
say
less
hops
goes
without
saying
but
they
have
similar
bodies
mouth
feels
and
they
both
have
a
clean
change
from
the
hops
to
the
malt
profiles
certainly
different
flavors
but
very
similar
drinking
experiences
o
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
a
mustbuy
for
me
every
season
o
this
beer
is
good
refreshing
and
tasty
very
simple
yet
well
made
o
a
decent
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
too
great
there
are
many
other
fall
seasonal
beers
i
prefer
paired
with
an
armands
chicago
style
combo
pizza
the
body
is
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
more
smooth
and
creamy
than
crisp
though
there
is
a
touch
mo
very
dark
and
crisp
carbonation
filling
but
not
overpowering
great
for
the
time
when
the
temperature
lowers
and
the
leaves
are
falling
pours
a
nice
orangebrown

a

bread
caramel
slightly
bitter
taste
and
the
taste
goes
along
with
the
nose
profile
very
nice
especially
for
the
style
taste
wise
feel
is
a
little
off
to
me
thus
the
3
5
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
knows
what
its
supposed
to
be
its
decent
but
i
probably
wont
look
for
this
one
again
notes
this
is
another
classic
example
of
a
traditional
english
ale
by
goose
island
medium
bodied
and
flavorful
yet
wellbalanced
and
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
that
fits
the
season
overall
for
a
fall
beer
i
was
expecting
a
marzen
surprised
to
get
a
slap
of
hop
bitterness
i
now
see
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
esb
it
is
ok
but
nowhere
near
my
favored
fullers
esb
i
prefer
the
english
version
i
suppose
o
overall
good
brew
for
the
style
i
like
the
lower
intensity
and
good
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
i
was
disappointed
to
see
it
was
an
esb
and
not
a
wethopped
pale
ale
but
for
the
style
it
exceeded
my
expectations
a
beer
to
drink
really
any
time
but
definitely
has
me
pumped
up
and
wanting
typical
harvest
ales

this

i
was
a

and
low

but
the
flavor
made
up
for
it
very
tasty
and
should
be
enjoyed
year
round
d
this
is
very
nice
on
its
own
and
could
undoubtedly
take
on
several
courses
from
a
fall
feast
bravo
goose
island
ill
be
kicking
back
with
this
next
autumn
living
in
chicago
i
usually
have
this
as
my
fall
go
to
beer
when
i
need
that
seasonal
taste
drink
is
great
id
happily
consume
this
one
any
cold
autumn
or
winter
day
poured
from

golden

with
notes
of
fresh

a

and
a

the
flavor
predominantly
dry
nutty
malt
with
lots
of
peppery
spicy
hops
and
some
grassy
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
dont
really
taste
any
cascade
in
there
it
tastes
more
like
a
big
dose
of
hallertau
medium
body
dry
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
crisp
lager
style
finish
ive
had
better
autumn
beers
nice
offering
from
goose
island
too
bad
it
isnt
yearround
smells
almost
like
sawdust
starts
smooth
and
lightly
sweet
with
a
velvetyness
to
it
then
it
finishes
dry
bitter
and
lightly
chalky
a
predominant
alcoholic
zing
to
it
as
well
medium
body
that
fits
the
style

flavors
and

is
really
nice
rich

and
a
sharp
but
malty

flavor
is

and
hoppy
but
not
overpoweringly
so
great

combination
here
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
this
beer
pours
a
orangeamber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
with
a
nice

backbone
the
taste
is
hoppy

balanced
the

this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
drink
again

interesting
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
autumn
esb
the
taste
was
something
like
mixing
an
american
ipa
and
an
esb
or
adding
a
lot
of
american
hops
to
an
esb
not
bad
and
an
interesting
beer
probably
wont
blow
you
away
but
for
the
price
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
really
an
esb

sipping

to
create
a
very
drinkable
beer
not

as
well
as
a
bit
of
bitterness
for
balance
drinks
well
and
this
was
always
a
fall
favorite
of
mine
notes
the
subtle
complexity
and
great
drinkability
make
for
a
fun
rounded
drinking
session
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
this
is
an
esb
but
i
dont
really
get
the
typical
diacytel
thats
so
pervasive
in
most
its
drinkable
though
and
really
not
all
that
different
than
many
pale
ales
out
there
taste
is
a
full
fresh
orange
without
any
sweetness
coming
through
followed
by
a
bitter
grapefruit
taste
and
finnishing
dry
the
effect
awakens
the
palate
leaving
lingering
popping
flavors
mainly
floral
and
citrus
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
a
dry
spritzy
beer
thin
bodied
the
story
here
is
the
bitter
swallow
and
finish
relatively
brief
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
is
really
growing
on
me
im
a
big
fan
of
goose
island
but
im
not
crazy
about
their
honkers
ale
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
it
was
perfectly
amped
up
in
all
the
right
places
and
although
it
isnt
extremely
memorable
it
certainly
isnt
forgettable
either
at
such
a
great
value
its
my
goto
autumn
session
beer
such
a
great
and
refreshing
beer
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
this
one
is
a
drinker
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
satisfying
to
the
very
last
drop
i
had
always
been
weary
of
goose
island
but
lately
theyve
been
changing
my
mind
from
their
awesome
brewpub
on
clybourn
to
their
chef
collaboration
series
featured
at
the
brewpub
they
keep
on
bringing
me
back
thank
you
gi
good
fall
beer
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
and
have
a
great
night
doing
so
on
the
palate
mediumtolight
bodied
nicely
done
maltiness
mixed
with
hops
carbonation
is
spot
on
delicious
and
supersessionable
goose
island
really
continues
to
impress
me
d
well
balanced
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
but
not
in
a
way
that
will
make
you
feel
stuffed
and
bloated
a
warming
beer
that
will
leave
you
wanting
more
d
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
fall
seasonal
from
goose
island
works
extremely
well
as
a
sessionable
fall
brew
simple
and
straightforward
but
in
a
good
way
simultaneously
hoppy
and
toasty
resulting
in
excellent
balance
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
ale
moreys
bottom
line
a
flavorful
fall
beer
to
be
sure
reminiscent
of
southern
tier
harvest
so
much
so
that
if
it
was
poured
into
a
glass
and
i
was
told
thats
what
it
was
i
wouldnt
question
it
and
i
drink
st
harvest
fresh
every
year
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
represents
it
has
the
right
appearance
maltyhoppy
smell
and
nice
clean
bitter
finish
this
beer
pours
dark
amber
with
a
little
over
2
fingers
of
white
head
that
has
pretty
good
retention
and
good
lacing
the
only
thing
that
i
would
knock
this
beef
for
in
terms
of
appearance
is
its
haziness
the
smell
is
mostly
of
citrus
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
pine
maybe
lacking
some
of
the
roasty
or
malty
notes
that
i
would
like
in
an
esb
its
taste
mirrors
more
of
the
piney
resiney
hops
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
more
of
a
roasty
malt
presence
this
beer
seems
a
bit
too
carbonated
to
me
but
overall
it
just
seems
too
light
this
beer
does
have
great
drinkability
though
thoroughly
enjoyable
fall
harvest
beer
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
found
it
to
be
a
wonderful
representation
of
the
style
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
fall
brew
to
awaken
the
soul
overall
meh
just
an
okay
beer
nothing
remarkable
or
special
about
this
one
just
could
not
get
past
the
overwhelming
grapefruit
taste
hops
were
there
but
the
grapefruit
was
simply
too
overwhelming
for
me
would
drink
again
only
if
i
had
too
recommended
poured
into
a
nonic
with
a
2finger
head
color
is
clear
amberorange
with
a
hint
of
ruby
excellent
head
retention
and
lacing
both
seem
typical
of
goose
island
bottles
that
ive
firmly
poured
after
a
hit
of
nasal
decongestant
inhaler
thank
you
girlfriend
for
that
nose
remedy
i
am
going
to
marry
the
hell
out
of
you
and
a
few
swirls
of
the
glass
i
began
to
smell
great
big
aromas
of
caramel
and
oatmeal
and
only
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
of
oatmeal
is
fantastic
it
is
like
eating
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
without
the
raisins
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
a
session
beer
even
as
it
seems
to
leave
a
film
of
malty
flavor
in
my
mouth
this
beer
doesnt
zap
the
tongue
and
kill
the
mood
even
with
the
higherthanusual
carbonation
a
very
solid
esb
quite
quenchable
and
for
the
style
is
just
americanized
enough
by
gi
to
make
it
worth
drinking
more
then
two
or
so
sure
its
usually
a
fairly
boring
style
but
sometimes
the
basics
are
well
worth
establishing
i
love
this
beer
and
think
if
the
bitterness
intensity
would
match
the
nose
this
would
make
an
incredible
american
ipa
as
this
stands
as
an
esb
very
nice
option
for
the
style
drinkability
there
is
not
too
much
going
on
but
harvest
ale
is
probably
the
most
balanced
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
hops
though
more
noticeable
in
the
scent
are
in
complete
equilibrium
with
the
caramel
malts
which
offers
all
the
citrus
flavors
without
the
explosion
of
offputting
bitterness
db
goose
island
delivers
solid
beer
for
a
good
price
i
am
starting
to
think
of
them
like
a
sierra
nevada
type
brand
the
hops
in
this
are
very
nice
and
make
for
an
overall
good
experience
its
almost
like
a
west
coast
ipa
mixed
with
an
oktoberfest
medium
body
good
carbonation
interesting
as
from
the
nose
i
expected
a
big
slick
juicy
ipa
but
the
mouth
is
more
like
a
well
hopped
esb
tasty
and
i
like
the
toasty
flavors
this
time
of
year
worth
a
shot
honestly
with
a
name
like
harvest
ale
i
wasnt
expecting
an
esb
oh
well
good
times
either
way
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
butter
flowers
light
citrus
and
caramel
the
taste
follows
closely
though
adding
a
decent
amount
of
orangerind
bitterness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
too
special
but
tasty
enough
for
an
occasional
quaff
pours
a
copper
brown
with
tan
head
i
am
in
the
chicago
area
and
i
can
get
this
beer
very
fresh
and
it
is
smells
like
citrus
hops
cascade
and
some
grain
from
the
malt
now
call
me
crazy
i
drank
one
of
these
yesterday
and
i
tasted
some
fresh
roasted
malts
not
sure
how
the
brewery
handles
this
but
it
all
came
together
exceptionally
fresh
and
it
was
very
very
pleasant
i
would
say
this
is
certainly
an
american
esb
interpretation
with
a
strong
west
coast
influence
from
the
choice
of
hops
with
their
citrus
and
pineyness
however
it
is
quite
nice
and
fruity
tasting
and
almost
kinda
refreshing
i
would
say
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
mouthfeel
as
with
almost
all
standard
goose
offering
is
slightly
thin
which
could
be
intentional
to
increase
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
strong
offering
from
goose
island
kinda
reminds
me
of
their
midway
ipa
but
more
balanced
this
is
a
really
good
beer
hats
off
this
one
poors
a
dark
rich
copper
in
color
and
had
a
one
finger
off
white
head
it
smells
very
dry
and
hoppy
with
good
bitterness
to
it
it
drinks
very
well
and
is
an
excellent
esb
it
boasts
excellent
bitterness
and
has
an
excellent
dry
appeal
its
extremely
drinkable
for
an
esb
and
probably
my
favorite
i
love
it
i
dont
really
know
much
about
bitters
but
i
did
like
this
beer
its
got
a
lot
of
toasted
bready
malt
some
caramel
maybe
some
tea
like
flavors
with
some
nice
grapefruity
hops
to
bring
some
bitterness
in
and
make
the
flavor
punch
its
very
sweet
and
malty
without
ever
being
heavy
thanks
to
those
hops
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
as
a
fall
beer
would
have
again
one
of
goose
islands
best
seasonal
offerings
d
very
drinkable
beer
it
has
more
flavor
than
the
honkers
ale
and
does
not
bore
me
as
fast
also
the
abv
is
still
rather
low
so
you
can
drink
lots
of
them
a
really
nice
beer
to
session
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
you
longing
for
another
sip
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
the
honkers
ale
both
are
nice
english
styles
with
a
slight
american
hop
twist
id
come
back
to
this
in
the
same
family
of
styles
i
preferred
honkers
ale
by
a
good
deal
but
once
in
a
while
this
makes
for
a
good
alternative
to
the
tyranny
of
the
pale
ale
without
being
on
an
altogether
different
planet
a
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
from
goose
island
but
a
decent
seasonal
diversion
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
autumn
beer
definitely
session
worthy
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
hops
with
a
touch
of
pine
quite
nice
but
wish
it
was
stronger
the
taste
is
of
grapefruit
hops
which
is
met
with
a
bready
malt
that
adds
some
fruity
and
toasted
notes
light
lemon
twang
and
finishes
with
a
piney
hop
the
beer
has
a
moderate
feel
with
tingly
carbonation
finishes
with
a
slightly
sour
feel
from
the
malt
and
slightly
bitter
from
the
hops
goose
island
seems
to
nail
the
esb
style
with
this
beer
some
nice
american
hops
with
a
traditional
esb
malt
profile
works
well
this
is
a
refreshing
and
rather
complex
esb
that
is
perfect
for
the
first
weekend
of
october
goose
island
always
makes
quality
products
d
this
one
is
ok
at
best
seems
like
a
work
in
progress
not
what
i
expected
at
all
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
that
will
taste
better
with
every
sip
so
drinkg
a
few
is
probably
a
good
idea
i
cant
do
that
today
overall
i
found
this
beer
enjoyable
but
not
in
my
mind
a
true
to
form
esb
more
of
a
pale
ale
imho
i
think
this
would
pair
awesome
with
some
excellent
wings
or
barbecue
but
hey
im
pretty
new
in
the
game
so
dont
take
my
word
for
it
give
her
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
hops
stand
out
as
the
dominant
flavor
but
theres
nothing
about
them
to
write
home
about
but
still
its
a
good
seasonal
i
always
like
to
see
a
decent
hop
profile
in
a
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
an
apa
or
ipa
pours
a
beautiful
amberorange
slight
haze
with
a
fresh
beige
head
the
smell
was
hops
and
caramel
with
pine
and
citrus
some
bread
and
some
sweet
malts
taste
is
much
the
same
pine
citrus
hops
are
balanced
with
sweet
malts
but
it
is
not
the
freshest
or
most
explosive
harvest
ale
out
there
its
average
but
lost
imo
in
a
sea
of
harvest
beers
its
good
its
drinkable
and
its
recommended
but
it
just
a
b
b
pretty
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
but
i
dont
see
myself
ordering
this
again
d
this
is
quite
good
and
i
always
love
picking
up
a
superfresh
sixer
before
the
hop
aroma
fades
strangely
its
hoppier
than
many
of
gooses
american
pale
ales
nicely
drinkable
for
an
esb
the
bitterness
does
not
overwhelm
but
it
is
dominant
however
it
doesnt
leave
you
with
so
much
aftertaste
as
to
be
unpleasant
in
anyway
d
a
good
tasting
ale
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
one
a
good
session
beer
but
not
necessarily
for
fall
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
largescale
seasonal
gi
beers
the
kolsch
is
too
watery
and
the
mild
winter
suffers
from
the
same
thin
weakness
i
think
this
is
a
beer
i
actually
enjoy
again
theres
nothing
paradigmshifting
at
all
about
this
beerits
just
a
bit
above
average
by
craft
standards
however
it
admirably
lives
up
to
the
harvest
feel
of
the
name
even
if
it
isnt
quite
a
perfect
exemplar
of
the
esb
style
thick
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
very
nice
retention
and
lacing
throughout
ultraclear
golden
amberred
color
with
many
carbonation
trailers
a
pleasant
smell
greets
the
nose
almost
woody
sweetness
both
as
malt
and
hops
very
balanced
beer
with
a
great
smooth
malt
balanced
with
excellent
yet
nondemanding
hops
definitely
plenty
enough
of
both
though
overall
very
darn
tasty
the
style
almost
seems
like
an
amber
ipa
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
and
nicely
carbonated
finishes
dry
and
begs
for
another
sip
i
am
very
very
impressed
with
this
one
in
2010
moreso
in
any
other
year
that
ive
had
it
an
absolute
winner
d
etd
easy
to
drink
is
this
esb
this
is
a
damn
good
tasting
ale
but
thats
about
it
if
this
were
sold
as
a
pale
ale
it
would
be
phenomenal
it
is
delicately
hopped
and
quite
smooth
but
it
also
lacks
that
oomph
i
would
expect
for
a
harvest
ale
just
leaving
more
to
be
desired
id
buy
it
again
but
wouldnt
be
in
tears
if
i
couldnt
get
this
d
highly
recommend
this
one
can
definitely
sip
on
these
all
night
long
if
your
watching
football
on
a
saturday
or
sunday
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
i
would
recommend
cheers
it
finishes
with
a
little
more
bitterness
than
the
initial
taste
bringing
more
of
the
hop
oils
and
resin
more
spicy
hops
a
little
bit
more
of
the
lemongrass
and
citrus
but
not
much
a
very
light
sticky
sweetness
lingering
it
dried
a
bit
as
well
all
the
flavors
linger
for
a
little
while
and
the
dryness
creeps
up
to
get
pretty
dry
accentuating
the
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
overall
good
lacing
and
very
good
brew
id
give
it
a
b
solid
drinkability
nice
tasty
seasonal
a
great
beer
from
a
great
company
an
appropriate
seasonal
and
fine
example
of
common
sense
brewing
experimentation
overall
goes
well
on
temperate
summer
nights
as
well
otherwise
this
is
the
best
fallthemed
beer
ive
tried
this
is
my
first
g
i
beer
it
was
on
sale
being
a
harvest
beer
and
its
feb
so
i
gave
it
a
whirl
the
initial
smell
i
know
its
going
to
have
a
great
bitternesshops
taste
i
get
the
smell
of
toasted
malts
maybe
a
little
bit
of
malts
and
caramel
the
back
end
also
gives
me
that
citrus
smell
that
intrigues
me
the
most
when
i
smell
a
beer
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
me
i
am
not
overwhelmed
by
any
one
taste
good
carbonation
on
this
beer
keeps
it
fresh
during
the
entire
bottle
i
enjoyed
this
beer
only
thing
that
wouldve
made
it
better
wouldve
been
enjoying
it
on
a
fall
evening
at
wrigley
field
watching
the
cubs
sew
up
the
pennant
d
good
session
brew
decent
taste
and
mouthfeel
harvest
ale
is
a
great
seasonal
though
im
not
sure
its
best
termed
an
esb
if
the
beer
has
no
english
hops
in
it
then
theres
no
reason
to
call
it
an
esb
its
clearly
a
pale
ale
with
american
hops
and
no
english
yeast
i
could
recognize
the
only
thing
is
that
its
a
bit
deeper
red
and
more
carbonated
than
a
traditional
pale
ale
i
didnt
take
off
points
per
se
but
if
you
are
looking
for
an
esb
then
you
might
be
disappointed
in
this
offering
enjoy
it
as
a
good
example
of
a
middle
of
the
road
pale
american
ale
d
a
terrific
bitter
well
rounded
with
lots
of
character
i
would
gladly
welcome
this
offering
in
my
glass
on
a
regular
basis
i
only
wish
it
was
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis

i
like
this
beer
very
much
for
the
style
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
esbs
but
i
found
this
brew
to
be
interesting
flavorful
and
sessionable
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
a
gi
beer
served
in
a
pint
glass
with
about
a
12
of
frothy
white
head
orange
to
light
brown
in
color
to
me
it
looks
the
color
of
autumn
opens
with
a
heavy
caramel
malt
that
lingers
for
a
bit
before
the
hops
kick
in
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
light
to
moderate
but
the
hops
definitely
take
a
more
predominant
spotlight
in
this
beer
than
i
would
have
expected
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
with
appropriate
carbonation
level
overall
a
good
autumn
beer
full
of
flavor
and
hops
though
i
did
find
the
malt
sweetness
to
be
a
bit
distracting
and
while
ive
had
this
beer
on
many
occasions
i
can
never
seem
to
drink
two
in
a
row
a
good
highly
drinkable
sessionworthy
beer
although
usually
known
for
their
stronger
more
extreme
beers
goose
island
did
surprisingly
well
at
achieving
a
wellbalanced
brew
that
goes
extremely
with
a
wide
variety
of
dishes
would
definitely
recommend
it
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
could
session
these
and
have
a
great
time
doing
it
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
not
overly
bold
or
anything
but
a
really
nice
drinking
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
kicking
back
and
drinking
a
few
of
thought
this
was
going
to
be
more
of
a
marzen
stlye
beer
but
turned
out
to
be
esb
it
was
pretty
refreshing
tho
poured
into
pilsner
glass
copper
color
white
head
tan
tinge
smells
bit
spicy
some
hops
also
get
some
bready
malts
along
with
it
tastes
like
bread
malts
to
start
and
ends
on
pine
hop
note
nice
taste
me
like
mouth
feel
is
light
enough
to
put
down
a
couple
few
of
these
so
that
ends
up
with
it
nice
and
drinkable
good
for
a
fall
night
d
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
i
didnt
know
how
the
cascades
would
play
on
a
classic
english
style
but
it
works
out
quite
well
in
this
one
in
fact
im
making
this
my
new
session
brew
poured
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
with
some
carbonation
has
a
small
fruity
hop
aroma
with
some
toasted
malt
it
tastes
very
light
for
an
esb
with
nothing
really
popping
out
at
me
besides
some
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lighter
then
expected
not
hard
to
drink
but
doesnt
appeal
to
me
very
well
drinkability
like
most
gi
brews
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
i
see
myself
going
back
to
the
fridge
repeatedly
before
the
night
is
over
d
goose
island
is
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
even
better
that
its
local
harvest
ale
is
another
fine
example
from
gi
enticing
to
the
eyes
and
wonderful
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
but
doesnt
overpower
i
liked
it
so
much
i
ordered
another
this
will
become
one
of
the
first
seasonal
beers
i
look
for
next
fall
d
very
high
these
are
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
ill
definitely
return
to
and
the
price
point
doesnt
hurt
either
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
well
done
gi
drinkability
not
a
favorite
and
i
will
be
passing
on
this
one
in
the
future
it
almost
drinks
like
a
pale
ale
notes
a
good
beeri
could
have
another
i
think
i
will
captures
the
fall
spirit
without
over
doing
it
overall
i
really
like
this
offering
from
gi
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
still
good
and
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
id
easily
have
more
d
very
drinkable
one
of
the
beers
i
look
forward
to
during
the
fall
d
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
straightforward
and
simple
but
enjoyable
and
great
for
the
fall
season
good
drinkability
a
nice
beer
overall
pretty
hoppy
for
a
bitter
its
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
gets
points
for
being
the
best
one
i
have
tried
from
this
style
taste
yum
for
my
palate
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
ale
with
the
hops
dominating
the
maltiness
but
not
overwhelming
it
im
so
glad
i
went
to
that
lousy
football
game
at
11
99
a
twelvepack
this
is
a
tasty
bargain
drinkability
is
good
nice
low
sessionable
5
6abv
probably
not
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
a
fine
example
of
the
style
this
beer
would
go
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
but
could
get
overpowered
with
highly
seasoned
fare
it
is
however
interesting
enough
to
go
solo
or
with
light
snacks
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
excellent
hop
nose
thats
well
balanced
with
a
solid
malt
aroma
it
smells
like
pale
and
40l
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
good
as
well
its
nothing
spectacular
in
the
malt
department
pale
and
a
low
lovibond
crystal
but
the
hops
are
a
plenty
and
really
make
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
harvest
ale
its
a
hop
lovers
beer
and
i
love
me
some
hops
one
nice
sip
of
this
and
the
adjective
machine
goes
to
work
plenty
of
toastybready
malt
sweetness
that
blends
well
with
the
hops
i
smelled
the
cascade
flavor
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
you
might
expect
from
the
smell
but
theres
a
nice
citrus
bite
if
my
eyes
were
closed
or
there
was
no
label
on
this
beer
id
probably
guess
it
was
a
pale
ale
still
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
to
be
honest
i
dont
really
care
what
style
category
its
in
i
find
the
smell
hoppy
with
much
more
subdues
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
very
much
citrus
hops
some
light
roast
and
fairly
thin
seems
more
like
a
pale
ale
to
me
and
i
found
it
too
bitter
to
enjoy
i
would
have
assumed
this
a
pale
ale
like
most
harvest
ales
but
im
not
sure
how
an
esb
really
differs
particularly
when
made
in
the
us
this
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
too
memorable
it
was
new
to
the
beer
bar
so
i
ordered
it
average
but
good
on
all
accounts
color
carbonation
smell
taste
mouthfeel
everything
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkable
for
sure
however
the
beer
is
quite
hoppy
and
the
flavor
sticks
around
a
while
leaving
little
room
to
taste
much
else
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
kind
of
frothy
head
after
a
few
minutes
the
head
goes
down
but
is
still
there
leaves
ok
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
to
me
at
first
then
the
hops
come
out
after
theres
also
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
taste
is
a
little
hoppy
mainly
citrus
hops
the
caramel
is
there
and
ends
kind
of
malty
bitter
but
finishes
easily
kind
of
has
that
familiar
goose
island
taste
at
least
of
the
honkers
ale
mouthfeel
may
be
a
bit
thin
but
it
could
just
be
the
style
im
not
to
sure
on
these
a
lower
abv
this
one
is
drinkable
like
i
said
it
reminds
me
of
the
honkers
ale
which
i
love
so
this
one
i
could
do
all
night
good
stuff
from
goose
island
again
which
ive
pretty
much
come
to
expect
conclusion
nice
hoppy
example
of
the
style
straightforward
and
tasty
drinks
easy
not
really
buying
this
as
an
esb
but
damn
tasty
drinkability
easy
drinking
autumn
ale
it
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
marzens
pumpkins
beers
and
brown
ales
very
solid
esb
overall
not
my
favorite
esbmarzen
whatever
it
is
the
odd
combo
of
watery
mouthfeel
and
high
bitterness
make
this
a
no
go
in
my
book
d
i
will
give
goose
island
this
with
thier
beers
i
have
tried
in
that
they
are
very
drinkable
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
drinker
but
to
me
it
drinks
more
like
a
ipa
that
is
past
its
prime
but
not
altogether
past
its
flavor
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
bitterness
to
this
beer
and
less
sweetness
oh
well
cant
have
it
all
though
this
is
a
completely
shock
from
what
i
expected
a
harvest
ale
to
be
i
thought
this
would
be
october
fest
but
instead
i
landed
in
something
id
say
is
akin
to
a
east
coast
ipa
booyah
very
surprised
by
this
beer
this
is
a
nice
fall
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
sessionable
taste
very
drinkable
beer
dits
an
everyday
beer
when
its
in
the
harvest
season
not
in
midaugust
it
seems
that
the
distribution
gi
are
a
bit
rushed
getting
the
beers
out
there
im
pleased
because
im
more
of
a
full
flavor
fan
very
bitter
but
sweet
and
not
overly
dry
i
dont
see
how
this
would
be
something
i
reach
for
on
the
shelf
just
not
that
much
going
on
not
my
favorite
interpretation
of
the
style
and
not
my
favorite
goose
island
beer
but
i
always
have
to
give
the
seasonals
a
go
d
its
a
good
fall
beer
that
would
go
down
well
as
you
watch
the
leaves
fall
quenching
not
largely
but
its
not
bad
at
all
another
decent
offering
from
chitown
nothing
really
stood
out
about
this
beer
and
indeed
ive
tasted
better
esbs
that
said
its
fairly
enjoyable
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
it
to
set
the
world
afire
could
be
a
good
steppingstone
beer
as
well
drinkability
super
sessionable
beer
here
nice
balanced
flavor
puts
a
smile
on
your
face
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
hops
some
spice
all
spice
or
ginger
and
some
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
extra
special
strong
bitter
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
up
front
some
all
spice
next
then
some
slight
tart
malt
in
the
background
a
general
dryness
is
associated
with
this
brew
but
the
great
mouth
feel
makes
complements
the
dryness
nicely
easy
to
drink
real
nice
flavors
sampled
this
fall
brewed
beer
in
march
and
it
was
a
pleasure
d
at
5
6
and
the
flavors
representing
this
style
of
beer
nicely
this
would
be
a
go
to
for
sure
when
its
available
but
alas
goose
island
is
not
distrbuted
to
pa
this
is
quite
a
sessionable
esb
is
not
overdone
like
some
other
attempts
at
this
style
this
offering
pours
amber
with
a
rocky
two
fingered
head
there
is
a
slight
chill
haze
but
some
nice
lacing
emitting
an
aroma
of
wet
hops
honey
and
grapefruit
and
sticky
sweetness
the
malts
are
strong
enough
to
support
the
the
spice
hops
a
good
bold
yet
ballenced
harvest
ale
the
fresh
hops
have
a
chance
to
shine
but
dont
steel
the
show
the
sweetness
plays
well
off
the
citric
spicy
bitterness
of
the
hops
d
this
is
a
really
tasty
possibly
my
favorite
harvest
ale
this
season
the
flavors
speak
to
falling
leaves
and
campfires
d
very
drinkable
not
really
the
best
esb
but
not
really
horribly
off
like
many
have
been
for
the
style
booyah
solid
stuff
here
i
was
really
digging
the
more
earthy
edge
this
had
plus
the
body
just
felt
fantastic
in
the
mouth
really
helping
bring
the
flavors
up
a
really
nice
fall
seasonal
from
goose
island
deep
copper
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
a
thin
cap
and
left

issweet

followed
by
a
citrus
fruit
hop
aroma
some
toffee
and
dark
fruits
in
the
background
flavor
is
malt
forward
for
sure
and
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
esb
then
this
is
right
on
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
hops
and
carameltoffee
taste
medium
body
with
a
nice
smoothness
from
the
rather
soft
carbonation
a
decent
amount
of
lingering
sweetness
and
mild
hop
bitterness
good
with
plenty
of
caramel
flavour
mixing
well
with
just
enough
of
a
hop
kick
to
make
this
one
interesting
very
good
big
ups
goes
out
to

for
a
great

another
great
delivery
from

am
afraid
the

is
a

too
sweet

this
is
a
good
session

i
will
be
picking
up
a

to
the
begining
of
the
respective
season
late
aug
early
sept
for
this
one
a
hidden
gem
from
goose
island
this
beer
has
a
superb
taste
and
no
stylistic
flaws
smell
consists
of
strong
hops
very
much
like
an
ipa
theres
a
sweet
malt
flavour
with
a
subtle
bitterness
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
zesty
fruity
hop
aftertaste
lacing
is
solid
and
clings
to
the
glass
in
halfinch
rings
an
impressive
american
extra
special
bitter
tastes
ok
for
a
fall
type
seasonal
brew
the
hops
definitely
come
through
and
this
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
liked
it
but
not
sure
the
drinkability
was
very
high
it
smells
very
hoppy
but
it
is
a
good
hop
blend
much
like
the
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
earthiness
coming
from
the
background
it
has
a
bronze
red
hue
with
a
tan
almost
brown
head
there
is
a
lot
of
head
and
lace
to
this
beer
i
would
say
about
two
and
a
half
fingers
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
earthier
but
still
a
good
use
of
hops
is
very
apparent
in
the
flavor
it
is
almost
like
an
ipa
with
some
bitter
citrus
tones
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
with
that
comes
a
decent
amount
of
burn

hops
citrus

dominate
the

with
a
slight
yeastyness
and
earth
when
i
swirl
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
but
remains
very
drinkable
crisp
slightly
malty
and
a
kick
of
hops
for
flavor
fading
quickly
to
a
bit
dry
and
bitter
on
the
after
taste
in
fact
it
leaves
my
mouth
slightly
dry
but
wanting
for
more
not
a
bad
esb
d
pretty
high
goes
down
easy
abv
is
manageable
light
and
refreshing
great
no
but
pretty
good
i
am
going
to
run
to
the
store
and
try
to
get
another
6pack
of
this
before
it
is
gone
and
then
i
will
look
forward
to
autumn
2009
when
i
can
get
this
beer
again
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
harvest
ale
usually
these
fresh
hop
brews
smell
quite
a
bit
hoppier
than
they
taste
but
this
one
manages
both
it
was
a
good
beer
to
start
the
day
with
and
im
glad
it
was
on
special
poured
from
a
bottle
this
has
my
mind
blown
color
is
brown
with
a
hint
of
amber
light
head
smell
is
malty
light
hops
the
taste
is
what
throws
me
off
hoppy
up
front
light
ipa
but
the
finish
is
very
malty
reminds
of
an
oktoberfest
light
carbonation
i
must
say
this
caught
me
off
guard
this
is
very
sessionable
harvest
ale
is
an
easy
drinker
you
could
easily
put
back
a
handful
of
this
stuff
in
an
evening
its
pleasant
if
not
overly
great
solid
but
thats
good
enough
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
that
pairs
well
with
food
well
worth
the
price
i
am
again
very
impressed
with
this
offering
i
had
it
at
goose
island
wrigleyville
last
year
on
draft
and
i
hope
to
get
back
there
again
to
enjoy
it
it
is
almost
as
good
in
bottles
as
it
is
on
draft
excellent
brew
pours
a
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
very
light
tan
head
the
hops
are
definitely
apparent
from
the
smell
of
this
one
it
is
a
thickmedium
body
and
seemingly
lightly
carbonated
the
taste
is
delicious
very
crisp
and
hoppy
with
a
solid
hop
aftertaste
but
not
really
bitter
at
allmore
of
a
sweethop
that
lingers
this
one
i
will
definitely
buy
again
and
recommend
to
others
without
a
doubt
creamy
and
fizzy
nice
rich
body
a
terrific
harvest
balanced
and
hoppy
very
good
example
of
the
harvest
ale
style
dgood
with
plenty
of
caramel
flavour
melding
well
with
just
enough
of
a
hop
kick
to
make
this
one
interesting
not
a
classic
harvest
brew
but
if
this
is
to
be
more
of
a
fresh
hopped
esb
then
this
hits
the
mark
for
sure
d
this
is
a
unique
harvest
ale
that
really
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
while
it
is
quite
malty
overall
the
flavor
is
complex
with
plenty
going
on
to
hold
my
interest
this
one
possessed
more
of
a
subtle
hop
character
that
was
still
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
d
bottom
line
could
drink
all
day
every
day
respect
beer
nice
beer
a
very
drinkable
ale
with
a
nice
clean
finish
i
can
have
a
couple
of
these
but
i
think
its
a
little
bit
onenote
to
have
more
than
two
rounds
i
ended
up
using
a
bottle
to
cook
some
bratwurst
in
because
i
was
bored
of
the
flavor
but
knew
it
was
good
enough
to
add
a
little
something
to
the
sauasage
drinkability
pretty
high
the
stickiness
is
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
calling
this
session
great
hop
profile
well
balanced
would
prefer
a
slightly
lower
abv
for
sessions
and
i
am
secure
in
my
manhood
saying
that
hey
goose
island
i
got
your
willi
glass
right
here
but
this
is
tasty
beer
goose
island
harvest
ale
was
amber
in
color
with
and
offwhite
head
the
head
had
good
retention
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
citrus
hops
with
a
little
toasted
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
was
sweet
toasty
malt
followed
closely
by
citric
hops
it
was
balanced
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
a
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
a
fall
seasonal
that
i
will
be
drinking
a
lot
more
of
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
bottled
82508
into
my
blue
point
shaker
glass
appears
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
smells
of
fresh
citrusy
hops
and
toasted
malts
tastes
of
lemon
pine
caramel
malt
as
well
as
a
mild
floral
note
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
pretty
tasty
harvest
beer
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
fresh
full
hops
flavor
with
good
support
from
toasted
malt
a
good
autumn
sipper
goose
island
has
always
been
a
sentimental
favorite
probably
one
of
the
first
craft
outlets
i
ever
encountered
courtesy
of
my
crazy
cousin
in
the
far
north
burbs
for
all
the
intense
flavor
profile
and
abundance
this
drinks
quite
clean
extremely
clean
one
of
the
most
wellbalanced
offerings
ive
come
across
recently
well
done
d
very
easy
to
drink
good
flavor
i
really
enjoy
this
time
of
year
and
all
of
the
seasonal
harvest
ales
that
hit
the
shelves
this
is
solid
release
in
the
bunch
theres
a
few
others
i
prefer
simply
due
to
stylistic
differences
but
this
ones
good
i
think
the
hop
and
citrus
fruit
flavors
could
be
amped
up
a
little
but
its
a
small
complaint
this
is
a
good
beer
definitely
recommended
its
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
ill
probably
buy
again
a
pretty
decent
american
version
of
an
esb
balanced
and
smooth
with
an
interesting
earthy
quality
a
good
session
brew
easy
to
drink
pretty
good
job
at
creating
that
classic
esb
flavor
a
nice
change
of
pace
fall
seasonal
this
beer
is
delicious
a
great
hop
finish
i
get
a
little
apricot
taste
on
the
finish
great
effort
by
goose
island
it
pours
an
amber
color
and
has
a
great
smell
i
equate
this
beer
as
a
mix
between
60
minute
magic
hat
9
and
a
splash
of
octoberfest
i
love
this
beer
any
hopheads
must
try
this
as
an
ofestautumn
beer
light
brown
color
great
creamy
head
nose
is
amazing
from
addition
of
wet
hop
cascades
very
earthy
musty
and
oily
taste
is
nothing
like
i
expected
im
not
a
big
fan
of
cascade
hops
but
this
really
grew
on
me
spicy
earthy
taste
that
didnt
have
the
intense
grapefruit
backbone
doesnt
linger
on
the
tongue
either
which
i
liked
a
bit
thin
in
the
finish
but
allinall
a
very
decent
beer
pours
a
very
solid
amber
and
nicely
carbonated
with
a
thick
two
finger
head
and
lacing
strong
whiff
of
cascades
and
centenial
hops
dominate
the
aroma
a
firm
smooth
body
balance
the
citrus
bitterness
of
the
hops
the
malt
base
provided
enough
balance
the
finish
was
a
bit
dry
and
not
at
all
cloying
one
of
goose
islands
finest
served
at
cellar
temps
5055
deg
in
pint
glass
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
small
head
on
an
amber
body
smells
very
sweet
maple
syrup
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
bit
of
hop
bite
although
the
hoppiness
wasnt
too
overpowering
in
the
taste
none
of
the
other
elements
could
rise
to
the
hops
level
much
less
above
it
a
bit
if
a
disappointment
a
medium
bodied
esb
with
a
orange
color
reminiscent
of
the
fall
leaves
the
brew
is
more
carbonated
then
other
ales
i
have
had
and
the
foamy
top
dissipating
slowly
overtime
the
taste
is
rather
unique
style
that
is
not
really
an
esb
but
rather
a
hoppy
orange
ale
the
malt
introduces
the
beer
and
the
clean
hops
seem
to
punctuate
the
taste
the
taste
didnt
disappoint
just
a
drinkable
brew
that
finishes
clean
mid
body
with
good
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
the
hop
aroma
knocked
me
down
very
fresh
smelling
could
drink
many
more
i
will
try
to
pick
another
sixer
up
before
the
end
of
the
season
i
do
not
want
to
wait
for
my
broinlaw
to
send
more
my
way
draught
old
chicago
this
one
pours
an
orangishamber
color
that
was
pretty
clear
there
was
a
decent
sized
white
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
lots
of
hops
to
the
nose
they
are
mainly
piney
but
there
is
a
caramel
sweetness
comong
to
the
top
also
some
spiciness
too
the
taste
is
quite
good
also
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malts
piney
bitterness
some
spiciness
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
easy
to
drink
and
easier
to
love
a
perfect
beer
for
the
fall
season
i
actually
thought
this
was
a
really
good
esb
and
its
worth
saying
its
good
value
for
the
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
6
99
well
worth
trying
in
my
book
d
another
solid
beer
that
i
wish
goose
that
i
wish
was
more
than
a
seasonal
easy
enough
to
finish
one
maybe
even
two
thats
when
i
would
look
to
see
what
else
i
had
in
the
fridge
highly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
regularly
while
it
is
around
i
almost
wish
i
was
outside
in
the
cold
to
enjoy
this
first
bit
of
seasonal
briskness
with
the
harvest
ale
d
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
and
one
whose
release
i
look
forward
to
every
year
definitely
a
fantastic
session
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
crisp
day
nothing
spectacular
here
but
a
solid
offering
d
this
drinks
well
it
has
a
good
balance
and
isnt
overpowering
that
it
overwhelms
after
a
while
it
is
a
good
autumn
beer
and
i
will
look
forward
the
rest
i
purchased
d
very
drinkable
and
low

not
a

nice
tasting
beer
but
closer
to
an
english
pale
ale
ala
bass
ale
than
a
true
esb
o
in
no
way
shape
or
form
is
this
an
esb
its
way
too
roasty
and
theres
barely
any
hop
profile
but
it
is
a
good
brown
ale
very
toasty
almost
roasted
malt
aroma
flavor
is
similar
with
a
lightly
bitter
finish
nice
malt
character
this
was
a
solid
effort
it
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
and
maybe
a
more
noble
hop
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
filmy
clingy
white
head
nose
of
roasted
caramel
and
toffee
with
hints
of
coffee
in
the
backbone
too
flavors
are
a
toffee
and
coffee
blend
forward
with
a
bittersweet
balance
throughout
smooth
and
light
bodied
with
a
richly
sweet
and
roasted
aftertaste
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
sweet
solid
simple
balanced
well
crafted
brew
overall
a
great
esb
very
smooth
with
strong
sweet
malt
o
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
buy
locally
its
rich
and
bold
but
not
overpowering
which
you
would
expect
from
a
nice
craft
ale
i
still
prefer
the
green
man
ipa
which
i
have
not
reviewed
yet
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
this
lovely
malty
ale
with
its
rich
flavor
and
dark
color
reddish
copper
color
with
a
small
but
nicely
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
toasted
nutty
malts
spicy
earthy
hops
and
cocoa
balanced
flavor
of
biscuity
malts
chocolaty
sweetness
toasted
caramel
and
some
grassy
floral
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
feel
thanks
to
a
lower
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
nice
little
easy
drinker
here
ive
come
to
appreciate
green
man
more
over
the
last
couple
of
years
i
would
drink
this
again
especially
if
i
see
it
on
tap
at
a
megacasino
nice
local
alternative
to
the
usual
bmc
fare
overall
pretty
drinkable
but
just
missing
enough
to
not
be
good
the
sweetness
is
fought
off
by
the
hops
but
still
win
by
a
landslide
almost
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
is
cut
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
and
leaves
it
pretty
soft
and
highly
drinkable
very
light
bitterness
lets
the
malt
really
come
out
overall
its
fine
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
not
very
good
tastes
like
a
homebrewed
brown
ale
no
real
yeast
character
and
way
too
much
carbonation
ill
pass
next
time
this
one
was
ok
but
nothing
mind
blowing
not
something
id
get
again
o
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
flavor
that
is
not
too
malty
but
not
bitter
either
well
balanced
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
have
several
during
a
session
and
i
think
it
would
pair
very
nicely
with
pub
food
i
really
enjoyed
this
smells
great
and
flavorful
this
is
a
really
great
lower
end
abv
beer
o
tasty
guzzled
4
or
5
sips
at
once
and
am
enjoying
it
more
not
amazing
but
decent
flavor
lots
going
on
and
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
both
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
it
has
just
enough
underlying
hops
to
prevent
this
from
being
too
malty
i
wouldnt
get
again
overall
a
well
made
esb
this
is
a
nice
beer
if
you
like
esbs
and
ill
order
it
again
when
i
see
it
on
tap

i
will
change
up
on
my
next
order
good
selection
here
at
the
bier
garten
english
in
spirit
but
not
in
complexity
a
smooth
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
i
had
this
on
draft
at
twelve
bones
in
asheville
nc
nice
beer
with
a
great
brown
color
and
decent
head
not
as
much
on
the
aroma
side
of
things
as
i
would
expect
but
that
could
have
been
part
of
sitting
outside
i
got
a
malty
backbone
to
this
and
not
so
much
of
the
hoppiness
that
i
would
have
expected
out
of
an
esb
tasty
beer
just
not
what
i
had
expected
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
little
head
nose
detects
caramel
and
nutty
malts
taste
is
robust
offering
caramel
and
nutty
malts
but
a
clean
hop
bitterness
to
finish
clean
and
well
balanced
medium
to
full
bodied
a
nice
first
introduction
to
green
man
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
have
like
some
more
hops
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
d
a
very
quaffable
esb
rock
solid
esb
from
the
growler
to
the
pint
glass
pours
a
light
amber
with
thin
whitish
head
green
man
malts
are
easily
identifiable
and
this
makes
for
a
very
distinctive
taste
the
malt
is
very
similar
to
their
ipa
but
tones
of
caramel
distinct
bitterness
but
reduced
hoppiness
provides
the
distinction
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
and
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
ontap
at
jack
of
the
wood
in
a
shaker
pint
a
hazy
aged
copper
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
and
deposited
a
thin

decently

apricot
mildly

finishes

and
a
little

drying
decent
its
funny
at
first
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
esb
however
through
finishing
the
glass
casually
i
learned
to
enjoy
it
maybe
it
was
the
brewmaster
giving
the
history
of
esbs
or
just
grew
to
liking
the
beer
but
i
believe
i
could
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
its
a
nice
caremely
color
like
a
golden
amber
if
that
makes
any
sense
mouthfeel
is
about
what
i
expected
from
a
beer
of
its
stature
but
after
a
few
sipsgulps
i
really
liked
it
ive
been
excited
to
try
this
beer
for
a
few
reasons
one
its
a
local
place
and
i
appreciate
that
two
it
comes
recommended
by
a
friend
this
beer
was
good
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
intense
hoppy
flavor
which
i
was
not
expecting
it
had
a
robust
natural
element
i
enjoyed
the
rawness
and
heaviness
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
only
5
3
maybe
there
is
power
of
suggestion
in
the
name
but
earthy
and
organic
came
to
mind
as
well
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
green
mans
other
beers
drinkability
was
fantastic
this
beer
had
more
flavor
than
some
beers
ive
tried
twice
its
size
fantastic
beer
served
on
tap
at
the
brewery
into
an
aviator
shaker
poured
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
subtle
roasted
malt
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
esb
the
flavor
was
nicely
balanced
with
the
sweet
and
roasted
malts
the
aroma
was
a
little
lacking
as
far
as
intensity
but
still
wasnt
bad
worth
trying
for
an
esb
fan
out
there
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
this
beer
is
certainly
sessionable
and
makes
for
good
drinking
overall
a
very
solid
and
really
well
put
together
ale
i
would
not
mind
at
all
getting
to
try
this
one
again
anyday
on
cask
at
jack
of
the
wood
poured
a
clear
rich
bronze
with
a
thin
soapylike
head
atopfruity
malt
notes
in
the
nose
with
light
toastand
lingering
leafy
hop
although
light
a
tad
thin
in
the
feel
with
malt
tilted
fruit
on
the
palatesome
biscuit
and
caramel
sweetness
as
well
makes
it
more
malt
tilteda
leafy
hop
smack
comes
in
the
finish
a
decent
esb
but
i
have
had
better
da
very
well
done
american
version
of
this
english
classic
the
cask
delivery
is
iconic
and
makes
this
quite
the
session
brew
d
real
easy
drinking
like
most
green
man
offerings
its
a
well
crafted
ale
and
certainly
enticing
enough
for
me
to
want
to
try
some
more
from
green
man
the
next
time
i
find
myself
in
asheville
copper
brown
color
and
kind
of
hazy
there
was
almost
no
head
and
i
believe
this
was
the
last
of
the
cask
left
which
may
have
contributed
to
the
low
carbonation
the
smell
is
wonderful
at
least
to
me
smells
kind
of
like
raw
beer
like
boiled
wort
very
sweet
smell
and
a
bit
estery
kind
of
like
a
tea
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
woody
you
can
tell
its
from
a
cask
tastes
very
sweet
without
a
whole
lot
of
bitterness
but
it
balanced
out
the
beer
to
keep
the
sweetness
from
being
cloying
tastes
a
bit
like
sweet
tea
from
the
floral
esters
in
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
though
there
was
almost
no
carbonation
i
actually
started
to
like
this
beer
once
i
got
into
it
there
was
good
balance
and
drinkability
and
i
may
have
a
second
one
or
revisit
it
but
not
something
id
want
all
the
time
the
esters
were
just
a
bit
too
dominant
for
me
drinkability
a
decent
esb
deep
amber
with
a
somewhat
fizzy
head
and
fading
pretty
quick
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
good
smell
of
grain
lightly
toasted
bread
caramel
and
earthy
hops
taste
is
a
bit
more
expansive
than
the
smell
which
was
a
somewhat
muted
lots
of
roast
flavor
more
than
i
expected
form
the
nose
or
a
beer
of
this
type
some
chocolate
and
caramel
toasted
bread
finishes
fairly
bitter
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
in
the
mouth
its
fairly
smooth
but
a
chalky
bitterness
from
the
hops
takes
away
from
that
at
times
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
the
entire
growler
simply
because
this
stuff
is
hard
to
put
down
tasty
enough
and
while
theres
not
much
to
it
this
helps
drinkability
one
that
you
can
figure
out
pretty
quickly
and
then
sit
back
and
enjoy
glad
i
grabbed
it
overall
have
i
mentioned
yet
that
i
think
im
in
love
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
its
an
easy
to
drink
session
beer
ontap
at
jack
of
the
wood
its
a
fine
beer
however
there
are
a
few
things
about
it
that
offsets
the
style
a
good
firm
malt
base
seems
to
headge
on
sweet
barley
grains
with
a
bit
of
astringency
husks
in
the
mouthfeel
the
hops
also
seem
a
bit
high
citrus
pine
and
biteey
but
the
beer
comes
together
nicely
with
a
cleanly
brewed
taste
of
fermentation
and
attenuation
nearly
minty
in
the
finish
body
could
be
maltier
with
a
higher
gravity
use
english
malts
would
have
sweetened
the
beer
and
rounded
out
the
american
hop
abrasion
call
it
beer
and
its
pretty
tasty
stuff
call
it
an
esb
and
it
stumbles
a
bit
this
beer
was
a
bit
lighter
than
most
esbs
the
smell
was
bitter
the
taste
was
bitter
with
a
sweet
ending
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
the
drinkability
was
good
i
could
drink
these
again
i
was
going
to
get
this
in
my
growler
but
the
oatmeal
stout
was
awfully
good
o
a
good
esb
a
bit
more
fruit
notes
and
overall
bitterness
than
i
would
prefer
but
the
basic
malt
flavor
is
fine
and
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warms
beer
of
the
month
club
pours
a
pretty
red
color
with
small
quickly
receding
head
sweet
fruit
aroma
with
lots
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
a
buttery
tone
flavor
is
malty
sweet
up
front
followed
by
buttery
floral
taste
and
ends
with
some
bitter
hops
though
these
are
pretty
toned
down
a
little
metallic
flavor
takes
away
from
things
easy
drinking
with
plenty
of
carbonation
ok
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
slightly
pale
ambercopper
coloring
with
a
steady
fast
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
and
a
filmy
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
surface
coating
nose
of
tangy
caramel
and
hints
of
nut
sweetness
subtle
roastiness
on
an
overall
subtle
aroma
flavors
are
roast
and
rich
sweet
forward
with
nutty
and
caramel
tang
in
the
backbone
and
not
much
to
help
balance
a
bit
jumbled
and
a
bit
cloying
light
frothy
bodied
due
to
the
carbonation
the
beer
has
an
overly
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
cloying
effervesced
frothy
finish
a
little
too
focused
on
the
sweetness
for
me
with
nothing
to
really
balance
o
a
nice
solid
straightforward
brew
highly
sessionable
and
great
balance
perhaps
could
use
this
as
a
gateway
brew
to
newbies
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
didnt
love
it
its
pretty
straightforward
caramel
grainlike
taste
tastes
like
it
smells
with
a
decent
hop
to
it
but
not
overpowering
or
too
bitter
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
wouldnt
search
it
out
pretty
good
work
woodstock
inn
its
pretty
good
for
the
style
theres
a
nice
balance
between
contasting
ingredients
mostly
a
session
beer
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
nutty
with
caramel
and
fruity
notes
and
a
hint
of
bread
the
flavor
leads
with
caramel
followed
through
by
grapefruit
and
bread
crust
its
a
bit
more
bitter
than
most
esbs
but
still
good
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
woodstock
red
rack
ale
is
a
decent
brew
crisp
and
refreshing
recommended
pours
a
clear
golden
garnet
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
and
laces
on
the
way
down
smells
of
caramel
mineral
and
a
bit
of
earth
and
spice
with
a
hint
of
butter
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
with
caramel
being
the
dominant
taste
earth
tart
and
butter
provide
a
bit
of
counter
to
the
malty
sweetness
but
this
one
really
leans
to
the
malty
side
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
a
buttery
malt
bomb
how
shipyardish
ok
for
what
it
is
but
there
are
better
red
ales
out
there
the
focus
of
the
taste
is
on
the
caramel
malts
and
yeast
with
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
not
a
bad
esb
in
the
long
run
oda
mellow
yet
attractive
beer
that
i
enjoyed
fresh
from
a
growler
i
was
a
fan
but
i
have
had
many
like
this
before
o
decent
beer
not
a
ton
going
on
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
an
average
beer
the
aroma
is
fruity
a
sign
of
some
good
english
yeast
with
a
little
bit
of
diacetyl
coming
out
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
mildly
bitter
and
again
fruity
however
as
this
beer
reaches
cellar
temp
the
nose
and
flavor
are
thereabouts
of
a
tub
of
move
theater
popcorn
butter
holy
crap
this
is
the
second
woodstock
inn
beer
that
i
have
had
and
they
were
both
diacetyl
bombs
needless
to
say
they
have
to
get
their
processes
under
control
to
fix
this
otherwise
it
is
a
fairly
solid
beer
drink
this
colder
if
you
have
it
its
a
shame
i
didnt
3
5
o
too
much
diacetyl
for
my
tastes
not
half
bad
id
love
to
try
the
noncontract
brewed
version
of
this
good
use
of
malts
perhaps
a
more
defined
hop
flavor
would
help
here
overall
nothing
special
in
terms
of
a
red
ale
the
lack
of
any
prominent
aromas
is
horribly
disappointing
but
the
rest
is
nice
if
i
was
a
local
of
this
brewery
i
would
drink
plenty
but
i
am
not
so
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
a
nice
surprise
certainly
worth
a
second
glance
overall
a
simple
solid
example
of
a
sessionable
enjoyable
amber
the
yeast
works
with
this
brew
pretty
well
but
its
not
like
the
woodstock
flavor
of
old
d
not
for
me
butterscotch
bomb
still
its
easydrinking
but
i
cant
handle
that
much
diacetyl
db
feels
all
over
the
place
not
much
balance
of
flavor
and
could
use
some
hops
doesnt
drink
ad
smoothly
as
many
ambers
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
amber
ale
but
really
leans
towards
a
scottish
ale
loads
of
buttery
notes
in
the
finish
taste
near
identical
to
the
smell
but
dryer
not
over
the
top
but
noticeable
buttery
sweet
caramel
flavor
while
still
being
clean
and
refreshing
a
very
pleasant
combination
flavorful
but
finishes
easy
sharp
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
powerful
creates
a
metallic
like
experience
but
does
add
an
interesting
kapow
barely
noticeable
hoppy
bitterness
lingers
at
the
very
end
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
it
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
cloying
fruity
the
beer
is
sweet
and
fruity
midway
it
is
nice
and
biscuity
it
has
a
lingering
sweetish
finish
the
beer
has
medium
body
kind
of
a
sticky
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
work
for
me
not
terrible
but
not
my
kind
of
brew
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
butter
with
some
sugar
notes
the
combination
makes
the
beer
smell
like
circus
peanuts
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
not
much
better
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grass
sugar
and
toffee

once

is

this

it
is
a
good
tasty
session
ale
that
works
well
if
you
like
them
on
the
maltier
side
overall
pretty
good
beer
d
goes

the
beer
pours
a

color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite

that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is

scent
along
with

of

taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
malt
sweetness
that
goes
down
with
little
effort
and
finishes
dry
with
some
light
esters
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
not
loaded
with
complexity
but
it
does
have
a
solid
malt
bill
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
amber

i
love
the
caramel
malt
character
as
well
as
the
light

its
just
the
right
amount
of
fruitiness
to
compliment
the
malts
and
hops
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
decent
offwhite

very
nice

i
pick
up
tangy
yeast
malt
and
a
little
herbal
hop
in
the
aroma
decent
enough
the
taste
brings
leafy

nutty

of
roasted

theres
lemon

feel
with

that
refreshes
pretty
drinkable

not
greatly
attractive
for
a
session
in
my
book
the
hops
are
nice
but
the

syrupy
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
like
a
mix
of
maraschino
cherries
and
caramel
taste
is
not
as
sweet
dry
muddy
indistinguishable
hops
and
malt
fizzy
carbonation
with
a
soapy
finish
nothing
interesting
going
on
pretty
bland
and
unremarkable
saving
grace
is
that
theres
nothing
particularly
offensive
meh
d
can
put
a
couple
back
no
problem
d
looks
good
and
feels
good
but
many
other
american
amber
or
red
ales
out
there
just
doesnt
feel
to
style
to
me
but
is
more
of
a
scottish
ale
dwasnt
sure
if
i
would
enjoy
this
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
perfect
beer
after
a
long
day
of
work
before
drinking
some
of
the
heavier
higher
grav
stuff
d
overall
this
beer
wasnt
that
great
i
thought
they
smell
and
taste
were
kind
of
bland
and
lacking
but
at
least
it
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
would
not
look
for
again
but
since
it
came
with
the
ac
gift
this
month
an
ok
beer
cheers
drinkability
this
one
i
find
to
be
ok
for
the
style
i
do
not
get
the
same
balance
here
that
i
get
with
other
ambers
not
overly
distinguishable
taste
wise
or
smell
wise
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
i
will
most
likely
not
be
revisiting
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
hazy
orange
red
with
thin
skim
of
a
tan
head
that
lingered
well
and
okay
lacing
nose
is
malty
citrus
fruit
with
a
hint
of
roasted
nuts
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
just
a
hint
of
a
tingle
taste
starts
out
okay
by
picking
up
the
flavors
of
the
nose
but
quickly
urns
grainy
and
skunky
finish
is
no
better
as
the
sweet
malty
fruit
is
quickly
overtaken
by
a
dry
cottony
taste
unfortunately
the
finish
outweighs
the
nice
start
on
this
one
and
ill
avoid
in
the
future
pours
a
medium
copper
color
quarter
inch
off
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
beer
and
a
light
wispy
lace
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
metalic
note
taste
about
the
same
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
held
well
even
with
a
strong
pour
average
at
best
not
worth
the
price
keep
looking
i
would
and
will
buy
this
again
medium
body
mediumtohigh
carbonation
carbonation
is
a
little
bright
and
would
make
this
more
enjoyable
if
it
was
turned
down
a
notch
i
honestly
cant
get
any
real
feel
for
the
finish
due
to
the
prickly
nature
of
this
beer
not
likely
to
have
again
sweet
orange
citrus
malt
with
faint
citrus
hop
balanced
by
toasty
malt
not
that
bitter
bitter
hop
in
back
smooth
juicelike
mouthfeel
although
it
is
accompanied
by
mild
a
syrupy
astringency
usually
seen
in
higher
abv
beers
overall
a
pleasantly
balanced
amber
with
high
drinkability
d
decent
not
bad
just
kind
of
bland
12oz
bottle
from
barbs
beer
emporium
in
concord
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body
with
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
aroma
is
very
very
subdued
but
hints
of
hops
and
malt
make
it
out
caramel
malt
with
some
herbal
hops
in
the
flavor
medium
in
both
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
with
moderate
drinkability
i
wonder
if
i
may
have
a
slightly
less
than
fresh
bottle
which
would
be
more
the
fault
of
where
i
got
it
than
the
brewer
but
all
i
can
see
here
is
a
fairly
standard
middle
of
the
road
american
amber
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
lots
and
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
two
fingers
of
dijontan
foam
that
retained
beautifully
as
a
cap
and
the
lacing
was
also
quite
good
the
aroma
was
toasted
malt
with
a
slight
mustiness
floral
hops
and
a
light
minerallike
quality
the
flavors
were
les
than
impressive
citrus
hops
and
hints
of
caramel
malt
amongst
cereal
grains
and
a
slight
earthiness
not
bad
but
rather
washed
out
and
illdefined
the
carbonation
was
a
little
too
high
which
roughed
up
the
mouthfeel
and
the
body
was
medium
just
ok
amber
colored
pour
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
aroma
of
sweet
malt
taste
of
caramel
malt
and
sugar
sharp
mouthfeel
though
not
overpowering
sweet
malt
flavor
gradually
blends
with
a
subtle
hop
finish
with
a
dirty
citrus
tang
to
it
nice
for
a
session
very
drinkable
mouth
feel
was
mediumlight
and
it
was
very
drinkable
a
nice
amber
ive
grown
partial
to
the
more
hoppy
of
this
style
but
this
certainly
with
well
within
style
guidelines
and
a
good
representation
poured
a
brownishred
color
that
looked
better
up
against
the
light
had
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
the
smell
was
dominated
by
hops
a
little
floral
but
mostly
a
strong
spicy
tangy
hop
smell
there
was
also
plenty
of
a
sweet
caramel
maltiness
in
there
too
it
was
an
interesting
mix
the
taste
combined
these
two
flavors
as
well
one
one
hand
there
were
bready
buttery
tasted
malts
that
ended
with
a
touch
of
caramel
on
the
other
hand
there
was
dry
bitter
hop
flavor
but
to
me
unlike
the
smell
the
taste
did
not
work
out
the
mixture
sounds
nice
and
should
have
produced
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
the
taste
was
just
a
little
off
to
me
and
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
seemed
contrary
to
one
another
as
opposed
to
complimentary
i
think
that
the
flavors
were
a
bit
too
strong
and
the
beer
could
have
benefitted
from
some
more
subtle
tastes
i
ended
up
finishing
the
beer
but
i
didnt
really
want
to
pours
to
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
and
no
lace
rich
aroma
very
pleasant
this
is
my
second
red
amber
over
the
past
few
days
and
this
is
definitely
a
style
i
enjoy
a
bold
flavor
yet
not
a
heavy
beer
at
all
i
expected
it
to
be
heavier
but
it
does
not
detract
one
bit
from
the
flavor
mild
to
light
carbonation
seems
to
work
well
with
this
beer
i
can
see
having
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
great
flavor
and
drinkability
i
would
definitely
buy
this
if
available
in
a
local
beverage
center
d
a
very
drinkable
pretty
good
representation
of
the
amber
style
this
is
a
fine
medium
balanced
brew
that
really
hits
the
spot
the
hop
profile
is
just
big
enough
to
be
tasted
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
malts
i
like
the
slight
twinge
of
sourness
that
bites
the
sides
of
your
tongue
well
done
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
had
it
for
the
first
time
with
a
dinner
of
fish
and
vegetables
and
it
went
great
its
not
overly
heavy
or
filling
so
it
wont
make
you
feel
weighed
down
a
great
beer
which
is
delicious
when
cold
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
a
great
tasting
beer
that
would
not
overpower
the
taste
buds
or
be
so
dominant
as
to
distract
from
what
you
are
doing
d
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
amber
ale
not
very
complex
but
tasty
enough
d
average
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
this
all
day
at
a
pub
should
the
opportunity
arise
its
not
too
filling
to
not
want
to
drink
more
another
selection
from
the
botmc
smells
oktoberfestlike
malty
with
earthy
centenniallike
hopping
pours
to
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
decent
clingy
head
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
carbonation
well
done
not
too
much
nor
too
little
good
body
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
ale
reminds
me
alot
of
a
sams
but
with
a
bit
more
bitterness
for
the
style
this
hits
the
mark
refreshing
and
balanced
from
start
to
finish
nothing
complex
but
a
good
down
to
earth
ale
i
would
return
to
this
brew
drinkability
nothing
to
write
home
about
theres
not
much
good
beer
flavor
even
once
you
strip
away
the
banana
esters
its
not
a
world
beater
but
its
multipurpose
tasty
and
makes
for
a
pretty
solid
pairing
with
foods
tomatobased
foods
solid
carbonation
a
little
thin
very
easy
to
have
a
number
of
these
mediumbodied
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
and
just
a
little
bit
of
lace
rich
malty
flavor
with
some
spices
mixed
in
there
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
malty
aroma
too
with
malts
overall
dominating
this
one
all
around
pretty
average
pours
a
vibrant
amber
oaky
hue
nice
buck
hide
colored
head
rises
up
and
then
falls
to
a
nice
thick
12
tightly
held
head
smell
begins
with
a
nice
caramel
covered
red
apple
a
touch
of
pine
resin
hints
of
hay
and
fresh
cut
grass
taste
is
rounded
out
with
a
balance
between
the
caramel
sweet
apple
touch
of
dark
wheat
bread
some
pined
up
earthy
notes
and
a
nice
refreshing
finish
great
gulper
easy
to
drink
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
just
an
ordinary
beer
overall
but
its
still
worth
drinking
for
a
while
taste
is
mostly
malty
with
some
burnt
bitterness
to
it
hard
to
describe
but
its
not
entirely
pleasant
or
offputting
though
just
indifferent
best
drunk
dancing
at
woodstock
this
was
nice
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessioned
but
to
be
honest
if
youve
tried
the
pigs
ear
there
is
no
need
to
try
this
its
a
little
different
slightly
more
bitter
drier
but
there
is
no
mistaking
the
same
qualities
it
shares
with
the
pigs
ear
i
would
think
there
would
be
a
noticeable
difference
imho
there
is
not
a
significant
one
could
see
this
working
well
with
simple
bar
food
cheddar
or
just
enjoying
a
nice
easy
to
drink
ale
drinkability
i
think
it
was
the
best
one
of
of
the
case
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
adding
amber
ales
to
my
list
now
this
beer
pours
a
mild
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
aroma
stands
out
as
being
big
and
malty
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
nice
biscuity
malt
flavor
that
becomes
thin
and
somewhat
buttery
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
interesting
taste
not
too
impressive
but
a
solid
beer
altogether
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
resulting
in
beer
with
little
to
no
head
the
color
is
bright
red
whose
nose
is
slightly
sweet
but
very
faint
the
resulting
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
red
that
is
a
big
malty
big
mouth
feel
the
mouthfeel
comes
from
a
very
carbonated
beer
not
in
a
bad
way
but
the
bubbles
do
dance
on
your
tongue
and
from
a
appearance
look
like
a
glass
of
soda
with
a
constant
trail
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
form
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
surface
the
finish
is
a
mix
of
the
malt
fading
into
a
dry
finish
that
has
a
subtle
alcohol
flavor
depending
on
the
abv
i
could
see
this
beer
a
as
session
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
either
worth
a
try
pours
a
red
brown
amber
with
a
short
offwhite
headskie
sweet
but
not
too
too
sweet
a
real
basic
red
ale
good
but
not
great
im
stoked
to
see
woodstock
inn
beers
at
the
store
but
they
should
really
bottle
their
better
ones
still
worth
snagging
at
a
good
price
a
12oz
bottle
with
best
by
june
2007
on
the
label
it
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
had
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
maybe
a
little
malt
fruity
taste
like
cherries
some
hops
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
too
fruity
but
still
enjoyable
to
drink
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
watery
with
a
bit
of
grainyness
good
drinkability
the
best
beer
of
the
sample
pack
i
had
from
woodstock
inn
easily
drinkable
this
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
flavor
i
can
see
pairing
this
with
the
doughiness
and
spiciness
of
a
brickoven
pizza
this
beer
is
pleasant
in
its
simplicity
but
it
is
cleary
a
one
trick
pony
d
a
decent
session
brew
but
i
couldnt
get
past
the
caramel
sweetness
d
drinkable
beer
glad
i
enjoyed
this
in
the
bottle
will
be
looking
forward
to
visiting
the
inn
this
winter
pours
with
a
thin
head
that
disappates
quickly
aroma
is
not
strong
but
the
maltiness
comes
through
the
first
taste
is
definitely
more
malt
than
hops
but
a
slightly
bitter
finish
brings
the
hops
im
a
fan
of
a
strong
malthop
balance
and
this
brew
fits
the
bill
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
buy
this
one
again
flavor
is
toffee
and
roasted
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
on
the
finish
very
easy
drinker
and
nice
well
crafted
brew
overall
i
would
buy
this
one
again
purs
a
very
nice
color
with
a
very
fruity
smell
tastes
of
caramel
and
other
fruit
flavors
that
leave
a
very
good
taste
in
your
mouth
doesnt
put
much
head
in
the
glass
and
it
is
really
not
that
hoppy
however
there
is
a
little
sour
taste
in
the
back
of
yout
mouth
otherwise
it
is
a
very
good
ale
despite
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
not
much
head
to
be
seen
dissapates
quickly
to
a
thin
border
or
foam
lots
of
maltiness
in
the
aroma
upon
tasting
its
an
onslaught
of
maltiness
with
a
caramel
taste
and
a
hint
of
fruitiness
theres
an
odd
underlying
sourness
in
the
taste
as
well
hops
are
very
subdued
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
in
the
future
d
not
bad
at
all
but
it
doesnt
leave
you
absolutely
craving
more
like
some
of
the
really
fine
beers
aoso
as
it
warms
a
grainy
comes
out
a
bit
too
much
however
overall
its
not
a
bad
ale
id
take
this
over
a
macro
and
some
other
micro
ales
iuve
tried
any
day
worth
a
try
is
fairly
accurate
no
real
faults
with
this
but
no
ohmigod
you
must
try
it
touches
either
pours
a
two

that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good

color

6
99
for
a
six
pack
from
market
basket
concord
nh
brewed
for
woodstock
inn
by
shipyard
brewery
i
received
a
bottle
of
this
in
a
trade
from
pete
ppoitras
this
poured
with
a
slight
haze
and
was
a
bright
orangey
copper
color
the
head
was
firm
and
had
a
tint
of
almond
in
it
the
smell
is
sweet
with
buttery
caramel
malts
rich
and
a
bit
solvent
like
bold
and
assertive
the
taste
is
rich
bitter
and
nutty
this
seems
to
have
some
doppelbock
characteristics
with
the
vienna
or
victory
malts
coming
through
theres
a
nice
roasted
almond
nuttiness
and
a
pretty
solid
body
of
malt
underneath
overall
a
very
nice
ale
and
one
i
would
seek
out
again
thanks
p
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
beige
head
over
the
clear
coppery
amber
brew
head
is
frothy
and
lasts
well
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
buttery
and
fruity
notes
taste
starts
with
grain
husks
which
carry
all
the
way
through
with
some
light
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
closing
with
a
tinge
of
butteriness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
pretty
good
enjoyable
representative
of
the
style
the
only
offering
i
didnt
have
on
tap
while
staying
at
the
inn
i
figured
id
take
their
most
popular
brew
home
in
a
growler
its
a
decent
looking
beer
with
a
darkish
amber
body
with
a
reddish
tint
the
head
was
thin
but
finely
beaded
and
well
proportioned
very
malty
and
somewhat
floral
and
breadlike
nose
enticing
to
say
the
least
really
a
full
bodied
well
incorporated
mouthfeel
its
crisp
malty
with
a
tremendous
sense
of
freshness
to
the
brew
theres
a
nice
breadlike
quality
that
serves
the
beer
well
the
finish
comes
off
balanced
with
a
true
mellonlike
flavor
really
impeccably
crisp
and
quenching
this
is
a
great
sociable
beer
very
tasty
yet
another
surprise
from
the
basket
of
goodies
brought
back
by
my
parents
a
no
brainer
really
this
is
an
easy
tasty
brew
light
to
medium
bodied
a
good
solid
average
red
wyll
a
surprising
bottled
offering
this
brew
is
bottled
by
shipyard
shipyard
brews
generally
are
aok
so
an
endorsement
of
this
product
by
their
willingness
to
bottle
it
i
knew
it
would
be
better
than
ok
and
it
was
the
appearance
was
a
nice
amber
red
with
a
very
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
was
a
hoppy
fruity
combination
an
initial
malt
taste
lasted
to
midpalate
then
the
citrus
hops
expressed
themselves
and
the
brew
had
a
light
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
and
very
smooth
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
very
smooth
and
easy
on
the
palate
i
mean
heck
i
bet
it
would
be
great
on
cask
or
something
like
that
but
again
not
as
an
amber
more
as
an
oldthumper
wannabe
this
is
a
good
flavored
drinkable
beer
but
i
was
disappointed
that
the
head
faded
so
quickly
to
never
be
seen
again
found
this
on
a
sales
trip
to
nh
pours
a
deep
amber
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
almond
colored
head
nice
and
clear
aroma
is
vaguely
roasty
sweet
somewhat
nutty
and
bready
nice
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
pale
malt
sweetness
touched
with
a
bit
of
roasty
bittersweetness
and
breadiness
hops
are
mild
balance
the
malts
nicely
and
really
only
lend
bitterness
at
the
very
end
of
the
sip
slight
pear
esters
mostly
in
the
back
end
and
in
the
finish
id
have
another
cheers
256
my
bottle
was
full
of
sediment
dreadful
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
and
tealike
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
there
is
a
bit
of
an
astringent
and
drying
quality
of
the
beer
in
the
mouth
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
extreme
or
strong
going
on
here
im
not
too
sure
why
this
particular
beer
is
sold
in
the
small
7
oz
bottle
size
the
flavor
is
very
malt
forward
the
hopping
is
there
but
the
malt
is
the
story
with
this
one
i
like
the
balance
in
all
of
this
one
this
is
a
good
beer
rogue
did
a
good
job
with
this
esb
good
medium
body
very
good
beer
just
not
what
i
expected
o
a
good
beer
but
i
expected
so
much
more
out
of
a
beer
with
that
many
letters
and
adverbs
in
its
name
in
such
a
tiny
bottle
very
open
ended
its
in
the
bottle
then
the
glass
then
after
a
sip
your
left
thinking
hmm
now
what
trim
the
abv
to
5
5
or
6
and
you
could
have
a
great
easy
drinking
flagship
beer
but
again
a
good
beer
overall
o
pretty
balanced
flavor
profile
that
finishes
with
an
odd
harshness
and
bitterness
i
got
this
bottle
for
free
but
imagine
this
one
is
worth
skipping
on
considering
how
much
these
tiny
rogue
bottles
usually
are
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
thin
head
this
is
a
7
beer
that
feels
a
bit
stronger
its
not
so
bitter
as
it
is
fruity
but
theres
a
mild
bite
to
it
that
keeps
you
from
drinking
too
quickly
a
12oz
draft
was
more
than
enough
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
wouldnt
likely
buy
it
again
o
this
was
a
one
tasty
esb
nice
balance
and
well
rounded
an
angry
little
7oz
bottle
keenly
stolen
from
global
brews
or
international
taphouse
cant
remember
which
in
downtown
st
loius
later
enjoed
in
lake
champlain
new
york
pours
a
mean
and
viscious
looking
caramel
color
with
a
ton
of
body
and
major
sediment
small
tan
head
rests
precariously
on
top
smells
like
a
huge
english
brew
tons
of
malt
earthy
and
sweet
on
top
of
a
very
bitter
brew
some
kent
goldings
in
here
for
effect
as
well
i
suspect
flavor
is
similar
less
complex
than
you
kinf
of
want
it
to
be
with
just
an
elementary
level
of
curiosity
inspired
oddball
finish
to
this
one
with
an
apparent
maltbittering
hops
war
going
on
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
i
think
i
need
more
than
7oz
to
make
a
fair
judgement
lots
of
body
though
and
it
aint
flat
overall
i
like
this
it
feels
like
the
base
of
the
maple
bacon
and
id
definitely
have
another
maybe
ill
pay
for
the
next
one
maybe
not
o
what
are
these
guys
doing
while
rogue
products
are
expensive
they
typically
have
some
value
for
the
money
this
is
like
bad
homebrew
o
four
bucks
for
only
seven
ounces
its
not
bad
but
gearys
hampshire
special
hits
all
the
same
notes
and
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
cheaper
in
new
england
at
least
enjoyable
but
the
price
makes
this
one
not
even
close
to
worth
it
o
usually
esbs
are
one
dimensional
but
this
one
has
a
bit
of
depth
to
it
the
fruit
comes
out
a
bit
as
it
warms
overall
a
tasty
ale
although
imperial
esbs
approach
crime
against
nature
status
pretty
good
beer
but
at
the
price
not
nearly
worth
it
poured
into
a
duchesse
de
bourgogne
goblet
pours
a
cloudy
red
orange
amber
thin
white
head
with
light
lacing
leaves
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
dominated
by
sweet
and
caramel
malt
slight
fruit
component
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
flavor
also
dominated
by
mild
neutral
and
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
hops
slight
hop
bite
in
the
finish
fairly
low
key
flavors
light
to
medium
bodied
pleasant
but
tastes
like
a
watered
down
old
ale
would
not
buy
again
at
this
price
point
overall
this
is
a
really
decent
beer
i
was
glad
i
didnt
pass
it
up
a
solid
take
on
the
style
with
nice
balance
and
the
only
real
drawback
for
me
was
the
price
final
thought
the
price
isnt
very
awesome
a
4
a
8oz
best
beer
rogue
makes
as
far
as
ipa
goes
o
its
hard
to
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
well
worth
the
price
the
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
winter
months
and
so
warm
not
bad
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
a
7
oz
bottle
that
has
fiery
burnt
orang
color
and
a
colloidal
suspension
of
granular
yeast
smell
is
sweet
and
abounds
with
caramel
and
light
citrus
some
bready
malt
flow
underneath
taste
is
quite
nice
with
an
english
malt
core
that
gives
good
smoothness
toasted
malt
with
a
tea
leaf
bitternes
a
touch
of
very
light
grapefruit
like
hop
oiliness
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
toasted
grains
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
gentle
creaminess
but
just
a
touch
light
on
the
bubbles
for
me
a
hair
more
carbonation
and
the
feel
becomes
like
velvet
a
nice
beer
overall
with
a
mild
character
and
definite
english
profile
o
tastes
like
a
hoppier
pale
ale
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
and
nothing
to
write
home
about
worth
a
shot
literally
like
a
small
small
bottles
worth
but
dont
feel
shorted
pun
intended
if
you
cant
find
or
try
this
one
d
decent
not
quite
sure
how
old
it
is
but
its
still
good
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
does
carry
a
nice
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
medium
drinkability
due
to
the
bitterness
this
was
good
tasty
and
enjoyable
just
not
a
session
beer
a
nice
little
treat
literally
due
to
the
small
bottle
size
this
would
be
much
better
if
the
ethanol
was
a
bit
more
masked
and
the
aromas
a
bit
more
expressive
of
note
the
head
is
still
there
and
i
am
half
way
through
nice
o
a
beautiful
drop
with
good
complexity
a
real
smooth
nectar
from
rogue
nice
balance
but
the
high
alcohol
was
the
predominant
take
away
big
fan
of
rogue
but
in
this
case
i
would
avoid
this
choice
again
ive
consciously
refused
to
shell
out
the
crazy
expensive
amounts
rogue
charges
for
the
pretty
ceramic
bombers
of
this
one
but
glad
to
give
it
a
try
even
if
the
serving
size
was
on
the
comical
side
overall
i
am
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
just
wish
it
was
a
little
cheaper
or
came
in
larger
sizes
this
is
a
great
esb
really
great
stuff
rich
fullbodied
mouthfeel
the
taste
starts
off
creamy
the
swallow
is
bitter
but
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
shortlived
overall
good
esb
only
wish
the
bottle
was
bigger
caramel
malts
right
up
from
balanced
well
against
a
pine
tar
like
touch
as
it
warms
some
more
grassy
and
herbal
notes
begin
to
show
their
nose
and
provide
some
really
nice
balance
to
the
overall
profile
as
it
warms
more
and
more
come
through
and
it
actually
picks
up
a
great
deal
of
hoppiness
by
the
end
huge
malt
bomb
at
first
followed
the
aroma
quite
nicely
becoming
hoppy
and
bitter
as
i
progressed
though
nice
touch
of
boozy
in
it
as
well
now
overall
very
nicely
done
well
balanced
and
nice
and
strong
a
nice
esb
with
solid
flavour
but
as
much
as
i
like
it
something
seems
to
be
lacking
for
me
grade
bb
if
you
prefer
a
greater
ratio
of
hops
to
malts
then
you
can
thank
rogue
for
tinkering
with
the
proportions
a
beer
like
xs
imperial
youngers
special
bitter
is
quite
telling
about
both
the
capabilities
as
well
as
the
mentality
of
this
rogue
brewery
they
can
brew
classic
established
recipes
as
fine
as
anyone
else
but
they
prefer
to
do
it
their
own
bolder
way
instead
clear
orange
body
multiple
streams
of
carbonation
thin
layer
of
white
head
on
top
some
lacing
nose
is
pretty
malty
and
dry
bready
some
grassy
hop
notes
taste
mirrors
nose
a
bit
of
sweetness
comes
through
some
bitterness
from
the
amarilllos
abv
fairly
noticeable
especially
in
comparison
with
regular
cask
version
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
sticky
pretty
boozy
for
an
esb
but
given
the
heritage
of
the
beer
one
that
should
be
tried
by
all
o
quite
enjoyable
but
not
sessionable
surprisingly
true
to
esb
o
a
solid
effort
overall
not
sure
it
holds
up
to
the
cost
of
the
bottle
normally
this
one
was
free
for
me
which
is
substantial
given
the
size
tasty
beer
pretty
good
drinkability
despite
the
boozy
aspects
good
balance
and
smooth
poured
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
or
lacing
from
a
7
ounce
nip
bottle
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
but
has
great
flavor
excellent
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
pleasant
very
nice
full
mouthfeel
strong
but
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
one
as
a
oneoff
dont
know
if
id
need
more
than
a
single
nip
bottle
at
any
one
time
though
d
interesting
beer
but
a
little
too
much
for
me
the
flavor
profile
was
good
but
ultimately
i
couldnt
finish
it
it
was
too
rich
pours
a
hazy
medium
brown
color
with
a
decent
lasting
head
scent
has
a
mixture
of
semisweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
taste
is
rather
smooth
and
mild
and
works
its
way
to
a
bold
ending
has
a
smooth
carmel
taste
that
ends
in
a
dry
slighty
bitter
taste
very
well
made
and
tasty
i
just
cant
understand
why
they
put
such
a
good
tasting
beer
in
only
a
7oz
bottle
definetly
worth
trying
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
which
i
cant
be
terribly
surprised
about
given
the
fact
that
i
enjoy
the
subtlety
of
the
little
beer
and
the
imperial
version
is
lacking
that
not
terrible
but
not
worth
seeking
taste
starts
sweet
but
quickly
gives
way
to
citrus
closes
with
lemony
bitterness
slight
numbing
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
glad
these
are
back
in
the
nonceramic
bottles
those
were
just
too
much
of
a
investment
a
solid
bitter
surprisingly
smooth
with
an
abv
of
7
1
o
great
high
octane
version
of
my
favorite
style
would
be
an
excellent
pairing
with
some
spicier
food
that
normally
you
would
not
have
a
special
bitter
with
o
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
because
theres
an
excellent
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
and
there
are
no
traces
of
alcohol
perceptible
in
the
taste
considering
its
strength
this
was
decent
enough
with
a
bold
bitterness
to
it
that
was
mostly
well
balanced
unfortunately
this
showed
a
bit
too
much
of
its
abv
in
spots
which
took
some
of
the
drinkibility
and
overall
enjoyment
of
this
away
from
me
the
7
oz
bottle
here
was
a
more
than
enough
of
this
though
an
interesting
concept
an
imperial
esb
to
be
frank
i
dont
think
this
style
needs
any
intensifying
as
this
offering
shows
this
is
the
third
or
fourth
of
the
7
oz
splits
xs
beer
ive
had
from
rogue
while
i
generally
like
their
beers
this
xs
series
has
been
underwhelming
particularly
given
that
each
tiny
bottle
is
costing
me
45
ive
not
had
one
yet
where
id
say
the
taste
was
such
that
id
want
to
buy
and
drink
another
7oz
glass
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
nice
dark
brown
body
with
a
red
tint
head
quickly
leaves
with
little
noticeable
carbonation
on
the
nose
i
pick
up
pineyforest
hoppy
bitterness
and
some
fruity
esters
the
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
with
sweet
malt
and
a
warming
dry
finish
very
nice
balanced
though
i
dont
get
the
pine
or
fruit
on
the
taste
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
beer
but
at
4
plus
for
7oz
i
doubt
i
will
revisit
esb
are
not
known
for
their
drinkability
unless
its
one
of
your
favorite
styles
its
not
one
that
you
go
running
back
to
either
especially
in
the
us
where
we
get
our
ibu
fix
from
our
ipas
which
can
exceed
esbs
threefold
a
very
enjoyable
strong
bitter
the
balance
keenly
struck
any
purported
extra
points
of
alcohol
are
all
but
invisible
but
for
the
strength
of
the
flavours
notwithstanding
the
booze
we
have
here
an
agreeable
multirounder
oh
wait
this
sithbottle
provides
just
that
itself
had
this
one
in
the
cooler
for
at
least
4
years
i
love
the
rogue
ceramic
bottles
as
theyre
perfect
for
aging
pours
a
very
deep
apple
cider
like
color
cloudy
to
the
point
of
being
almost
opaque
head
was
initially
very
creamy
but
gradually
reduced
to
only
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
rich
caramel
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
piney
hop
notes
in
the
background
some
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
up
taste
is
a
deep
malty
base
with
a
wonderful
lingering
hop
finish
caramel
malts
come
through
the
most
but
it
has
a
good
hop
bitterness
even
for
52
ibu
the
one
thing
holding
this
beer
back
is
that
it
feels
a
little
thin
by
that
i
mean
that
a
beer
with
this
heft
in
its
taste
should
be
a
little
thicker
also
a
suprising
amount
of
alcohol
comes
through
at
only
7
overall
though
a
great
beer
and
one
that
has
aged
really
well
d
this
was
a
decent
esb
but
as
for
being
imperial
and
in
the
xs
series
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
drinks
easy
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
but
a
bit
too
boozey
for
such
a
big
beer
its
rather
weak
in
all
the
flavor
departments
there
is
some
lead
off
sweetness
and
malt
character
but
overall
its
just
not
happening
in
the
taste
department
its
almost
flat
and
plasticy
on
the
palate
i
did
not
dislike
it
but
there
is
almost
nothing
to
enjoy
about
it
at
the
same
time
overall
a
very
nice
beer
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
the
excellent
flavor
along
with
the
moderate
abv
make
for
a
beer
that
i
really
wish
i
could
get
locally
lucky
i
have
friends
that
remember
me
when
they
travel
d
very
nice
this
is
an
interesting
interpretation
of
an
odd
style
i
would
normally
think
that
an
imperial
bitter
would
turn
out
to
be
a
illconceived
frankenstein
of
a
brew
but
this
works
much
better
than
expected
the
red
apple
yeast
character
melds
nicely
with
the
rich
malt
and
there
is
just
enough
hop
character
to
keep
things
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
beer
im
very
pleased
with
the
overall
goodness
in
each
sip
it
starts
good
and
finishes
just
as
good
notes
this
is
quite
a
hearty
beer
cheers
could
so
easily
drink
this
all
night
unfortunately
that
would
be
seriously
detrimental
to
my
finances
a
good
esb
but
it
doesnt
taste
any
different
than
the
regular
youngers
to
me
at
over
four
dollars
for
this
tiny
bottle
i
wont
be
buying
any
more

pah
no
such
thing
this
is
a
smooth
and
sessionable
ale
roaring
with
character
but
smooth
and
supple
on
the
palate
a
fabulous
esb
and
a
stylistically
true
one
oh
america
you
never
cease
to
amaze
me
taste
is
sharp
and
fairly
bitter
its
a
bit
funky
and
odd
but
pretty
tasty
and
creamy
its
got
a
sharp
bitterness
pretty
decent
beer
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
is
perhaps
sub
par
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
nothing
particularly
special
a
decent
drinker
a
touch
syrupy
being
so
sweet
but
a
fine
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
but
i
dont
see
myself
asking
for
seconds
right
away
definitely
worth
revisiting
in
the
future
though
rogue
imperial
youngers
special
bitter
ale
is
cloudy
and
amber
with
a
thin
sand
colored
head
that
vanishes
quickly
it
has
a
hoppy
aroma
with
notes
of
grapefruit
and
juniper
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
its
quite
bitter
topheavy
and
dry
it
tastes
like
grapefruit
peel
juniper
and
grass
the
grapefruit
peel
bitterness
lingers
its
very
drinkable
but
probably
a
little
too
bitter
to
be
a
session
ale
d
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
brew
would
definitely
drink
it
again
final
notes
a
delicious
esb
even
if
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
bordering
ipa
with
the
hops
and
alcohol
content
but
still
has
that
super
sweet
esb
front
end
not
really
a
session
beer
save
it
for
a
cold
night
interesting
and
pretty
good
bottle
poured
a
deep
hazy
copper
color
ale
with
good
carbonation
and
good
head
retention
with
some
lacing
as
well
aroma
of
dry
and
lightly
bitter
hops
is
interesting
with
a
nice
bready
dry
caramel
malt
backbone
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
and
bitter
notes
though
not
as
bitter
as
expected
with
a
huge
dry
caramel
malt
backbone
with
bready
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
interesting
though
not
necessarily
something
i
would
need
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
if
your
thinking
about
buying
this
beer
dont
it
was
pretty
average
not
bad
per
say
but
at
a
rip
off
price
this
is
a
gimmicky
beer
a
very
average
beer
with
nothing
special
to
speak
of
then
considering
the
ridiculous
price
of
this
it
really
brings
it
down
why
is
this
so
expensive
there
are
no
special
or
rare
ingredients
that
would
drive
the
price
up
also
no
special
barrel
aging
or
time
constraints
that
would
drive
the
price
up
easily
one
of
the
most
overpriced
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
makes
me
feel
embarrassed
for
purchasing
it
when
i
was
so
completely
sure
this
would
be
the
case
another
in
the
line
of
way
overpriced
7
oz
bottles
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
some
haze
from
the
bottle
conditioning
no
head
or
lacing
at
all
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
some
honey
notes
some
alcohol
and
overripe
melon
flavor
is
expressive
and
powerful
hits
instantly
with
great
tangy
bitterness
pretty
complex
also
this
is
really
good
beer
well
balanced
between
the
biting
hop
bitterness
in
the
front
and
mellows
out
into
a
long
smooth
bitterin
a
good
way
finish
punctuated
here
and
there
with
some
fruitiness
and
lots
of
malt
great
beer
but
way
over
priced
which
brings
down
its
drinkability
for
me
d
this
is
a
very
good
esb
overprice
like
most
rogue
products
but
good
pours
a
clear
burnt
honey
with
some
mahogony
the
head
is
large
with
frothy
tan
colors
and
lacing
that
lasts
the
smell
is
strong
with
roasted
maltbrown
sugarbread
yeastand
alcohol
the
taste
has
a
bitter
alcohol
flavor
along
with
roasted
malthoneybrown
sugarand
a
bit
of
a
weak
watery
aftertaste
the
mf
is
light
with
the
flavors
mixing
ok
not
a
bad
beerbut
not
my
favorite
rogue
had
on
draft
at
taco
mac
prado
pours
a
hazy
rust
color
initial
taste
is
caramel
and
a
sweet
yeasty
ness
the
mouthful
definitely
gives
you
more
of
the
yeastyness
with
nice
sweet
hops
in
the
after
taste
definitely
recommend
it
does
kind
of
remind
me
of
a
sweet
sour
dough
roll
overall
a
unique
well
rounded
brew
that
would
do
great
as
an
appetizer
or
dessert
from
the
7
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
july
31
2010
it
pours
a
mahogany
treelike
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
malts
with
a
a
sidebar
of
hops
the
taste
comes
across
as
bitter
with
a
nice
wallop
of
hops
at
the
end
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
the
larger
bottle
overall
its
two
saving
graces
were
the
bottle
size
and
the
carbonation
i
would
say
its
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
and
definitely
not
one
to
session
7
oz
bottle
interesting
beer
it
has
a
big
biscuit
apricotplum
and
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
good
dose
of
piney
hops
the
hops
seem
a
bit
faded
but
still
manage
to
reign
in
the
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
though
drier
than
expected
given
all
the
malt
carbonation
is
average
there
is
a
good
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
a
darkened
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
unfortunately
the
little
nip
bottle
isnt
really
appropriate
in
my
opinion
its
not
a
terribly
strong
beer
and
the
flavor
doesnt
tire
the
palate
quickly
or
anything
so
i
dont
really
see
the
point
if
the
special
malt
and
hops
that
rogue
used
are
expensive
or
limited
in
quantity
they
should
have
just
put
it
in
more
limited
distribution
in
my
opinion
there
should
be
a
point
to
using
such
small
bottles
drinkability
not
bad
simple
and
fairly
refreshing
with
the
bitterness
abv
is
a
tad
high
but
because
of
the
ridiculously
small
bottle
wtf
rogue
getting
through
a
couple
of
these
wouldnt
be
a
problem
not
the
best
offering
from
this
brewery
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
end
musings
this
sample
came
from
a
7oz
nip
bottle
which
i
think
is
probably
the
bare
minimal
to
base
a
review
of
but
somehow
still
didnt
seem
enough
for
me
at
the
price
they
charge
4
60
i
would
say
its
not
worthy
of
its
high
price
for
its
limited
volume
and
appeal
d
a
nice
brew
from
rogue
that
straddles
the
line
between
esb
and
strong
ale
pretty
nicely
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
and
this
beer
has
a
little
something
for
everyone
definitely
sweet
and
malty
but
with
a
hoppy
focus
and
a
fruity
character
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
toffee
and
caramel
upfront
along
with
peppery
and
floral
hops
fruity
ale
esters
mineral
orange
zest
and
alcohol
the
flavor
kicks
it
up
a
notch
bam
with
some
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
upfront
along
with
caramel
and
toffee
biscuit
fruity
esters
minerals
orange
marmalade
and
a
little
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
considering
the
abv
a
very
tasty
beer
even
though
it
bears
little
resemblance
to
an
authentic
english
bitter
but
being
a
rogue
beer
i
expected
that
going
in
i
really
question
the
7oz
serving
size
and
will
not
be
purchasing
this
again
as
the
price
of
the
bottle
was
as
much
as
many
larger
bottles
of
better
beer
poor
decisions
rogue
i
feel
like
you
ripped
me
off
by
making
such
a
small
7oz
bottle
id
understand
if
it
was
a
10
bomb
but
this
makes
no
sense
johns
head
must
have
swelled
and
now
hes
trying
to
make
a
wallet
to
match
none
the
less
decent
beer
albeit
nothing
exceptional
or
beer
hunter
worthy
would
drink
this
one
again
served
from
7
oz
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
pours
a
hazy
redorange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
maintains
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
malt
hops
and
skunky
the
flavor
is
of
malt
subtle
hop
and
wood
it
is
medium
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
i
did
not
really
enjoy
this
brew
much
the
flavor
was
quite
harsh
and
not
appealing
i
think
the
skunky
aroma
was
also
a
turnoff
on
this
one
i
was
expecting
more
but
was
unfortunately
let
down
a
rare
miss
from
rogue
impression
yet
another
superb
oregon
beer
im
moving
to
oregon
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
again
i
dont
see
the
imperial
part
and
youd
be
better
off
to
just
buy
the
regular
youngers
special
bitter
14
99
this
is
close
to
worth
it
imo
i
wish
they
would
make
this
in
normal
bombers
instead
of
the
ceramic
ones
but
hey
buggers
cant
be
choosers
amazingly
wellbalanced
for
an
esb
of
this
strength
lots
of
hops
sure
particularly
goldings
but
with
a
great
biscuity
malt
balance
that
really
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
experience
a
bit
intense
for
people
devoted
to
traditional
english
beers
but
american
beer
fans
should
find
this
a
very
nice
bottle
cheers
overall
impression
meh
i
dont
think
i
let
it
cool
enough
would
be
otherwise
quite
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
despite
its
imperial
existence
i
think
i
need
to
try
more
esbs
to
see
how
this
compares
drinkability
awesome
beer
and
all
of
the
xs
beers
i
have
had
so
far
have
been
awesome
second
of
the
rogue
imperial
series
that
ive
tried
and
this
one
is
just
as
good
as
the
last
imperial
ipa
due
to
my
increasing
love
of
a
nice
bitter
beer
this
one
scores
high
on
the
charts
excellent
malty
backbone
and
hits
all
the
right
spots
as
it
kind
of
engulfs
your
taste
buds
probably
the
only
time
ill
want
to
spend
the
18
bucks
on
one
but
well
worth
the
money
and
the
experience
unfortunately
it
just
leaves
you
wanting
just
a
little
bit
more
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
stronger
english
bitter
scent
which
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
better
than
average
dose
of
hops
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
dry
bitter
flavor
that
screams
hops
with
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
malt
to
balance
it
out
its
extremely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
even
at
7
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
takes
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
and
gives
it
some
attitude
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
nice
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
adding
a
little
extra
strength
this
is
a
good
beer
with
substance
and
flavor
to
drink
for
a
long
time
d
a
really
easy
drinker
perfect
for
the
fall
months
as
it
is
malty
for
the
fall
but
the
bitterness
and
slight
alcoholic
warmth
makes
this
a
comfort
food
type
beer
that
would
go
well
with
any
hearty
stew
i
may
have
to
return
to
get
more
of
this
while
it
is
on
sale
plus
the
bottles
are
awesome
for
homebrew
a
definite
winner
if
i
wasnt
paying
attention
i
could
drink
3
pints
of
this
real
quick
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
im
glad
jay
picked
up
a
half
case
for
like
30
normal
price
booyah
beautiful
bottle
but
pricey
definitely
like
it
better
the
the
ysb
more
hops
is
a
good
amelioration
for
me
drinkability
an
esb
crossed
with
american
hops
rogues
typically
higher
bitterness
and
a
solid
bump
of
alcohol
which
im
continually
being
told
is
what
folks
are
into
these
days
personally
i
found
the
full
entire
sixteen
ounces
to
be
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
finish
pours
a
very
deep
copper
color
although
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
deep
hoppy
scent
a
good
amount
of
amarillo
with
some
nice
ek
in
there
too
fairly
deep
hoppy
taste
some
nice
floral
and
slight
pine
attributes
with
enough
malt
to
keep
it
thick
and
balanced
goes
down
fine
if
not
overly
smooth
honestly
it
reminds
me
of
my
own
first
try
at
an
apa
recipe
as
a
homebrewer
not
sure
if
that
means
good
things
to
me
or
that
this
is
just
a
decent
beer
thats
not
worth
the
huge
cost
of
one
bomber
tasty
enlish
ale
that
could
easlily
be
mistaken
for
an
english
ipa
a
pleasure
to
drink
nice
and
enjoyable
but
not
a
standout
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
rich
clear
reddish
copper
with
a
not
very
thick
but
finebubbled
head
malty
aroma
has
undertone
of
cinnamon
rich
malty
spicy
and
lively
flavor
has
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
firm
cinnamon
undertone
texture
is
lively
fizzy
and
edgy
leaving
a
spicy
finish
i
wish
it
had
a
date
on
it
so
i
could
get
it
aged
d
very
good
went
down
easily
notes
seems
like
a
lot
of
bittering
hops
were
used
and
the
flavor
hops
must
be
something
without
the
citrus
notes
this
beer
is
dry
and
lovely
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
a
little
pricey
but
a
great
brew
this
was
a
tuff
one
to
finish
very
bitter
and
by
the
end
of
the
glass
my
gums
were
numb
a
god
beer
but
also
a
one
at
a
time
beer
note
abv
is
74
according
to
the
label
at
52
ibus
this
one
is
probably
not
going
to
excite
the
extreme
hopheads
but
the
bitterness
is
noticeable
and
most
importantly
it
works
in
concert
with
the
other
elements
in
the
brew
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
newport
i
wish
i
could
have
had
this
in
the
bottle
so
i
could
have
that
beautiful
image
of
don
younger
on
a
horse
but
anyway
this
is
where
my
notes
start
to
get
a
little
less
legible
appearance
was
good
red
in
color
this
off
white
head
not
too
much
lacing
my
notes
say
it
was
mostly
malty
with
a
faint
taste
of
hops
in
the
middle
thin
to
medium
bodied
im
not
a
huge
bitter
fan
but
this
was
good
i
bought
this
crazy
looking
flip
top
white
ceramic
750
ml
bottle
about
a
year
ago
at
wallys
wine
for
around
fifteen
dollars
decided
to
crack
this
open
a
few
minutes
ago
splitting
it
with
my
dad
poured
into
my
rubicon
snifter
color
is
a
mix
between
a
dark
orange
and
copper
color
34
inch
soapy
off
white
head
that
stays
around
a
few
minutes
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
hops
caramel
sweetness
grassy
accents
musk
mild
booze
and
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
dry
all
the
way
through
and
enjoyable
little
complexity
thrown
in
with
the
malts
and
very
mild
fruit
mostly
citrus
finish
is
bitter
and
can
be
harsh
until
it
warms
fully
you
have
to
like
bitter
and
dry
beers
to
be
able
to
enjoy
this
one
if
you
do
then
it
is
a
nice
brew
to
sit
back
and
sip
on
went
well
with
all
the
garlic
we
are
eating

a
friend
of
mine
brought
this
bottle
to
me
it
pours
a
hazy
tan
color
looks
very
much
like
their
other
imperial
offerings
it
smells
like
a
bitter
lots
of
hops
and
a
distinctly
european
maltyness
tastes
like
a
strong
bitter
ale
which
is
exactly
what
i
expected
crisp
and
light
it
dances
all
the
way
down
to
your
belly
the
bottle
was
gone
all
too
fast
a
pretty
bang
on
esb
even
with
the
extra
high
octane
behind
it
it
packs
a
bit
of
a
whallop
but
is
smooth
not
rough
around
the
edges
very
well
contained
d
goes
down
very
easy
as
mentioned
above
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
another
ceramic
bottle
that
i
wish
were
a
glass
that
way
i
could
drink
it
again
just
too
costly
in
the
ceramic
an
interesting
brew
and
very
good
too
nice
balance
an
american
esb
that
mixes
english
and
american
characteristics
dont
know
if
its
quite
worth
the
price
tag
though
the
cool
ceramic
bottle
probably
has
something
to
do
with
that
worth
picking
up
to
try
it
at
least
once
though
black

750ml
bottle
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
pours
a
crisp
dark
amber
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
is
slow
to
diminish
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
crisp
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malt
with
that
unmistakable
pacman
yeast
tinge
the
taste
is
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
esb
but
like
many
people
have
said
an
imperial
esb
cannot
truly
be
an
esb
the
taste
is
dominated
by
crisp
pine
hops
and
burnt
caramel
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
alcohol
presence
that
is
not
too
overbearing
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
but
like
the
other
expensive
rogue
xs
bottled
beers
i
wont
be
drinking
it
that
often
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer

so
bitter
not

if
i
could
have
more
than
one

for
the
opportunity
pours
a
nice
slightly
hazed
rich
copper
topped
by
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
lingers
around
smells
pretty
tame
could
be
that
it
is
a
year
or
so
old
bur
considering
that
its
from
a
ceramic
bottle
i
wont
hold
age
too
much
against
it
malty
sweetness
is
all
that
i
am
really
getting
from
the
nose
some
earthy
hops
subtly
excite
the
tongue

intial

noticable

cant
imagine
it
being
too
badly
affected
by
the
age
considering
the
root
style
special
bitter
yum
just
picked
this
up
i
got
lucky
and
found
it
hidden
in
the
back
of
the
beer
store
thought
i
couldnt
find
this
beer
anymore
love
the
ceramic
bottles
that
rogue
has
been
doing
it
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
amazing
clarity
nice
thick
fluffy
head
not
much
retention
but
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
it
has
a
nice
aroma
very
floral
and
fresh
awesome
taste
nice
subtle
bitterness
with
perfectly
balanced
sweetness
also
a
bit
of
floral
flavors
i
bet
this
would
go
great
with
spicy
food
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
velvety
and
good
carbonation
awesome
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
drink
it
drinkability
though
its
a
fine
beer
its
certainly
a
bit
cost
prohibitive
to
having
much
in
stock
i
could
drink
another
one
but
it
isnt
really
necessary
to
have
an
excess
of
these
unless
youre
looking
for
some
spiffy
bottles
to
hold
your
homebrew
im
happy
to
have
this
one
served
on
cask
with
a
lot
of
friendly
sass
at
the
horse
brass
in
portland
one
of
the
finer
esbs
ive
tasted
all
i
can
say
is
wow
pours
a
burned
orangegold
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
rich
with
caramel
light
fruit
and
amarillonw
hops
yum
body
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
booze
is
invisible
breakfast
tea
and
orange
are
big
flavors
caramel
is
also
present
somewhat
bready
and
biscuity
hints
of
grapefruit
downable
by
the
gallon
simple
but
exceptional
imperial
youngers
special
bitter
ale
brewed
to
commemorate
the
30th
anniversary
of
the
horse
brass
pub
in
portland
is
wait
just
a
minute
ive
just
emptied
the
last
of
the
750
into
my
glass
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
disappearing
that
fast
on
second
thought
maybe
a
second
bottle
is
in
order
hey
rogue
put
this
beer
in
bombers
and
watch
it
fly
off
the
shelves
this
was
quite
drinkable
especially
for
something
labeled
imperial
interesting
that
most
nw
breweries
jack
up
the
abv
on
their
esbs
beyond
the
traditional
range
and
even
more
unusual
for
rogue
to
nod
towards
tradition
and
acknowledge
this
does
not
abide
still
it
is
pretty
light
and
easy
drinking
tasty
enough
thatll
youll
want
another
got
this
one
for
free
at
the
rogue
public
house
looks
nice
in
the
glass
smells
extremely
inviting
and
backs
everything
up
with
a
kick
ass
balanced
flavor
theres
almost
a
caramel
sweetness
that
balances
the
bitterness
and
makes
every
sip
extremely
enjoyable
i
personally
think
this
is
better
than
the
brutal
bitter
which
i
felt
is
an
awesome
beer
in
its
own
right
good
job
rogue
this
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
but
rogue
makes
much
better
brews
so
dont
spend
14
bucks
on
a
bottle
of
this
unless
you
save
bottles
i
really
like
the
bready
flavors
in
this
beer
very
unexpected
considering
the
style
hops
are
also
a
tad
more
subdued
than
expected
and
balance
out
the
malty
wholeness
with
a
slight
spruceness
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
is
not
very
well
concealed
though
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
a
tad
thinner
than
ideal
but
no
great
knock
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
i
can
definitely
enjoy
more
of
these
mild
and
creamy
this
bitter
ale
is
quite
drinkable
pours
a
dark
and
murky

a
small

a
very
nice

sweet

enhanced
by
some
hops
grapefruit
in
the
nose
much
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
extremely
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
malt
and
the
citrusy
hop
flavors
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
hidden

this
is
another
great
brew
from

deep

topped
by
a

the

formed

down

the

was
mostly
hops
citrus

earthy
with
a
little
grainy
malt
solid
bitterness
that
was
still
quite
soft
and
balanced
plus
lots
of
grapefruit
and
tangerine
hop
flavours
that
kicked
in
part
way
through
and
lingered
into
the
finish
the
malt
was
bready
and
there
was
a
fruity
sweetness

moderate
carbonation

still
remained

this
was

the
taste
reveals
a
decent
backbone
of
hops
and
citrus
to
go
along
with
the
dominant
caramel
malt
flavor
great
mouthfeel
on
this
one
the
medium

and
moderate

make
it
incredibly
drinkable
for
an
imperial

beer
i
greatly
prefer
this
over
the
standard
ysb
its
a
shame
that
rogue
isnt
adding
this
to
their
regular
lineup
d
this
beer
was
served
very
cold
so
it
was
hard
to
pull
out
the
subtle
flavors
but
it
was
a
very
smooth
nice
session

and
would
be
amazing

im
a

fan
of
the

special
bitter
in
fact
i
think
its
one
of
the
most
sessionable
ales
in
rogues
stable
this
imperialized
version
is
very
tasty
but
its
increased
size
and
alcohol
content
lacks
a

of

nevertheless
ill
have
no

well

bill
balanced
by
the

it
does
lack
more
depth
in
the

department
and
the
carbonation
could
be
lower
to
enhance
the
other

d
definitely
doesnt
have
enough
sweeter

lots
of
tea
floral
herbal
flavors
very
balanced
flavors
nothing
overpowers
and
it
is
a
little
thin
for
me
but
a
good
all
around
everyday
beer
a
good
solid
typical
english
brew
pours
as
a
deep
red
colour
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
and
good
carbonation
there
is
a
quite
sharp
nose
to
it
with
a
hint
of
sugary
sweet
toffee
beneath
and
a
noticeable
yeast
aroma
the
flavours
are
quite
fruity
upfront
lots
of
sour
berries
there
is
lots
of
bitterness
in
the
flavours
a
dry
hoppiness
and
a
carbonic
texture
nothing
special
very
average
and
slightly
underwhelming
beer
loved
it
in
the
glass
and
on
the
nose
but
not
as
convinced
when
i
put
it
in
my
mouth
i
think
its
well
made
but
just
not
what
i
like
a
good
solid
beer
wish
it
was
bottled
in
a
brown
or
coloured
glass
though
it
might
help
to
keep
it
in
good
nick
longer
this
is
a
household
beer
at
my
house
a
good
english
ale
and
mild
hops
character
keeps
this
beer
interesting
even
with
the
dry
finish
its
still
refreshing
d
500ml
seems
like
an
appropriate
serving
goes
down
pretty
easy
low
abv
decent
taste
inoffensive
texture
md
despite
the
filtered
pasteurised
form
presented
in
a
clear
bottle
ouch
the
true
quality
of
this
famous
fruity
bitter
ale
has
not
been
compromised
greatly
fortunately
the
body
is
full
and
the
taste
is
well
structured
and
it
still
tastes
absolutely
light
and
refreshing
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
the
texture
of
course
is
the
relatively
high
level
of
fizziness
a
problem
sn
seems
unable
to
address
for
a
long
long
time
now
nevertheless
honestly
im
biased
for
shepherd
neames
ales
particularly
this
one
thin
mild
but
pleasant
overall
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
more
of
a
traditional
english
take
not
bad
stuff
and
pick
it
up
only
if
its
easy
to
find
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
had
it
is
rich
yet
drinkable
fresh
clean
and
perfectly
balanced
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
well
after
the
bottle
i
cannot
place
but
not
unpleasant
would
go
well
with
most
foods
i
think
perhaps
especially
crumpets
would
drink
again
but
only
after
i
try
everything
else
i
wouldnt
make
this
and
everyday
beer
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
what
i
usually
drink
overall
interesting
beer
dominated
by
the
bitter
flavour
too
focused
on
the
bitter
side
and
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
could
expect
from
earlier
reviews
i
drank
this
straight
from
the
fridge
and
it
was
only
in
the
second
half
of
the
glass
i
could
truly
appreciate
what
a
good
beer
it
is
not
cheap
but
certainly
worth
it
for
the
quality
an
excellent
parting
shot
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
esb
i
had
a
pint
of
this
on
cask
during
a
recent
trip
to
london
its
a
beautiful
rich
amber
colored
brew
with
a
thin
dense
head
the
aroma
is
great
a
nice
malt
backbone
a
little
toasted
qualities
crackers
bread
and
very
very
slight
herbal
hops
if
you
search
for
them
the
taste
is
equally
satisfying
moderately
dry
but
with
plenty
of
malt
goodness
in
the
flavor
theres
a
steady
bitterness
that
settles
in
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
the
midtaste
very
little
hop
taste
smooth
very
smooth
wonderfully
fresh
and
drinkable
i
could
have
many
of
these
i
am
convinced
in
my
haste
to
get
into
this
i
overchilled
it
and
lost
the
initial
impression
the
colour
though
is
beautiful
clear
clean
copper
with
a
creamy
head
that
hung
around
leaving
fine
lacing
i
must
be
olfactorily
challenged
because
i
am
weak
on
aromas
so
i
didnt
get
what
other
reviewers
said
its
toasty
and
malty
with
a
hoppy
lift
but
i
just
cant
pick
any
more
detail
than
that
on
the
flavour
side
i
found
a
perfectly
balanced
malt
and
hop
toasty
again
and
a
bit
metallic
back
of
the
palate
i
love
the
bitterness
just
right
and
great
length
with
a
lipsmacking
finish
i
must
confess
to
being
an
esb
noob
so
i
cant
really
compare
with
many
others
but
i
like
this
a
lot
this
is
an
english
bitter
with
some
attitude
and
unconventional
hopping
this
clear
coppery
ale
maintains
a
white
head
that
leaves
lace
behind
the
hops
are
rather
interesting
going
beyond
the
usual
fuggles
and
goldings
into
some
more
minerallike
notes
the
yeast
has
a
decided
fruity
flavor
to
it
that
carries
into
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
heavy
with
biscuity
malt
and
hop
flavors
for
only
5
abv
it
is
quite
fullbodied
a
second
or
third
bottle
would
be
most
welcome
but
it
does
not
fall
into
the
realm
of
the
truly
sessionable
a
solid
if
unspectacular
beer
would
definitely
be
interested
in
trying
a
cask
version
had
this
beer
at
my
reliable
lord
moon
pub
in
london
bishops
finger
is
a
clear
deep
amber
topped
by
a
dense
off
white
head
that
leaves
excellent
patterns
of
lace
aroma
is
very
mild
but
inviting
very
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
subtle
hopping
over
a
solid
malt
base
touch
of
fruit
typical
of
the
brewer
is
present
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
tastes
malty
with
a
very
pleasant
dry
bitter
aftertaste
i
really
enjoyed
this
nice
fullbodied
beer
could
definitely
have
a
few
more
of
this
but
since
i
live
in
queensland
ill
have
to
wait
until
winter
i
wish
lax
had
places
like
this
to
grab
a
pint
o
good
hearty
ale
big
profile
probably
leave
it
at
one
i
think
for
me
an
average
bitter
just
decent
stuff
overall
i
love
the
uk
we
just
dont
get
to
see
brews
like
this
unless
we
go
on
a
weekend
cask
expedition
in
the
us
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
night
i
do
love
the
little
bit
of
extra
alcohol
in
this
too
that
last
bottle
i
had
must
have
been
a
bad
one
but
this
one
was
great
im
sure
ill
be
greeting
my
fridge
with
another
one
of
these
sometime
soon
d
much
better
than
i
remember
a
good
solid
session
beer
the
pint
was
very
disapointing
and
seriously
lacked
any
body
it
had
a
very
bland
taste
with
only
a
hint
of
fruity
aftertaste
that
gave
it
any
note
this
was
a
very
disapointing
watery
beer
the
fact
that
it
did
lack
any
body
may
result
in
this
being
a
decent
all
night
beer
but
not
for
me
i
didnt
even
finish
the
bottle
appearence
well
intact
nice
looking
bottle
good
colour
and
proper
head
foam
stuck
around
and
would
leave
good
lacing
shinning
rubybrown
colour
aroma
is
kent
hops
could
be
stronger
especially
considering
the
lovely
scent
these
hops
lend
mouthfeel
in
the
same
manner
that
is
to
say
developed
and
good
character
but
somewhat
restrained
like
its
trying
to
be
too
well
mannered
flavour
is
light
buttery
texture
some
nutty
notes
highmedium
bodied
some
bitterness
the
kent
malt
makes
up
the
majority
of
flavour
tasty
with
satisfying
finish
however
flavours
seem
to
trail
off
taste
kinda
falls
apart
and
really
wears
thin
near
the
end
carbonation
is
decent
but
i
think
this
would
be
better
on
tap
this
is
very
much
within
the
british
manner
a
beer
full
of
character
but
still
mild
mannered
and
more
concerned
with
being
quaffable
than
bold
or
distinct
its
drinkable
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a
larger
off
white
head
thats
compact
but
dwindles
down
after
a
few
minutes
tons
of
lacing
along
the
glass
aroma
has
an
earthy
base
to
it
with
a
floral
edge
and
caramel
maltiness
seems
quite
balanced
and
quite
nice
taste
follows
suit
but
adds
more
of
a
fruity
character
apples
and
bananas
a
slight
buttery
flavor
comes
with
the
earthyness
from
the
yeast
there
is
a
slight
mineral
flavor
which
rides
along
the
whole
time
the
hops
are
always
there
floral
and
fragrant
but
they
never
really
come
out
and
shine
finish
is
drying
a
bit
citric
with
a
slight
english
toffee
sweetness
well
balanced
and
smooth
the
hops
and
malts
and
yeast
work
nicely
here
enjoyable
but
not
the
most
complex
or
intriguing
beer
out
there
still
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
a
wonderful
pour
gives
a
firm
long
lasting
head
almost
as
in
a
belgian
abbey
brew
smell
is
exceptional
well
matured
hops
with
hints
of
banana
the
taste
is
matching
the
expectations
of
the
bouquet
offering
some
charcoal
grilled
tomatos
paired
with
mango
chutney
and
rye
bread
in
the
palate
quite
exotic
a
very
interesting
example
of
a
strong
ale
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
appearence
an
attractive
gold
and
ruby
colour
it
had
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
a
smooth
lace
most
of
the
way
down
however
the
smell
and
taste
was
less
impressive
had
a
sweet
malty
flavour
my
associate
said
it
was
quite
plain
it
lacked
a
range
of
flavours
it
would
go
well
with
sweeter
foods
like
a
tomato
based
pasta
nothing
special
in
the
taste
department
but
what
the
heck
its
a
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
m
smooth
and
mild
carbonation
had
this
on
cask
at
a
pub
in
bath
it
was
a
solid
ale
but
a
little
on
the
uninspired
side
it
had
a
dark
reddish
color
with
an
offwhite
head
its
smell
packed
way
more
of
a
wallop
that
the
taste
as
it
was
rather
fullbodied
overall
the
is
a
good
bitter
and
very
easy
to
drink
if
i
ever
see
it
on
cask
in
america
ill
definitely
have
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
which
is
part
of
what
makes
this
so
easy
to
drink
taste
is
a
little
bitter
up
front
with
some
plants
earth
and
pepper
very
little
aftertaste
and
whats
there
is
not
bitter
at
all
her
taste
is
very
alcoholic
roasted
malt
flavours
shy
bitter
hoppy
malt
is
dominant
in
this
beer
and
the
finish
is
very
dry
some
floral
notes
are
present
from
the
hops
but
the
malt
take
much
more
of
the
taste
a
piney
taste
is
present
and
very
oily
brew
bishops
finger
is
a
good
esb
its
plenty
flavorful
and
was
a
joy
to
consume
i
picked
up
the
only
bottle
that
ive
ever
seen
i
just
wish
i
could
remember
where
that
was
im
sure
its
even
better
fresh
and
oncask
this
is
a
very
tastey
esb
that
i
highly
recommend
if
you
like
english
ales
its
maltier
than
most
but
not
underhopped
unfortunately
its
in
a
clear
bottle
fortunately
theres
lots
of
brewery
and
beer
info
on
it
bottle
poured
a
clear
redbrown
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
great
retention
which
is
quite
a
surprise
since
all
my
previous
bitter
had
no
head
really
aroma
of
floral
malt
with
some
nut
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
with
some
robust
malt
floral
hops
and
some
nice
nutty
and
subtle
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
this
is
an
above
average
bitter
golding
hops
great
hoppy
aroma
some
barley
initially
pale
copper
colour
with
lace
and
aestheticly
pleasant
transparent
bottle
keep
out
of
sunshine
drying
tad
metallic
understated
carbonation
drinkable
but
a
500
ml
for
3
is
more
than
enough
not
a
bad
british
esb
but
nothing
particularly
stands
out
either
500
ml
clear
bottle
no
best
before
date
that
i
could
spot
good
session
beer
ill
buy
a
few
cases
of
it
next
time
bishops
finger
pours
a
dark
wooden
red
colour
stained
mahogany
a
huge
fluffy
head
appears
that
slowly
disipated
to
about
a
half
finger
thickness
still
thick
and
creamy
leaving
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
at
first
is
awful
clear
bottle
skunked
beer
and
this
was
a
terribly
skunked
beer
however
after
a
few
minutes
of
air
the
skunk
smell
died
downor
my
nose
grew
accustomed
and
i
could
smell
the
beer
caramel
toffee
malts
sugar
and
flowery
herbal
hops
the
skunk
smell
was
still
their
but
not
nearly
as
dominant
as
that
first
initial
sniff
the
smell
is
probably
worthy
of
a
higher
score
but
because
of
the
skunk
smell
i
must
take
it
down
a
point
the
taste
is
excellent
light
nicely
balanced
and
a
perfect
blend
of
sweet
and
dryness
it
almost
tastes
like
caramel
and
honey
spread
over
whole
grain
toast
their
is
also
a
dry
herbal
and
flower
taste
in
the
end
and
because
of
its
light
taste
id
consider
it
a
perfect
session
beer
lightly
carbonated
smooth
mouthfeel
definitely
drinkable
as
stated
above
i
must
buy
this
by
the
case
nice
fancy
500ml
clear
bottle
put
a
dark
copperbrown
ale
in
my
pint
glass
modest
head
but
good
lacing
fairly
pungent
aromas
of
fruit
apricot
over
a
musty
burlap
undertone
good
malt
spine
of
caramel
malts
upfront
but
it
is
quickly
ballanced
off
by
resinous
pinelike
hops
that
continue
to
get
increasingly
bitter
until
the
finish
where
they
leave
a
lasting
metalic
after
taste
this
is
a
quality
bitter
but
these
styles
of
ale
are
not
my
favorite
so
that
bias
may
explain
my
overall
rating
it
reflects
my
impression
that
this
brew
has
nothing
unique
to
distinguish
itself
in
this
style
overall
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
normally
go
for
but
a
pleasant
experience
none
the
less
pretty
good
this
is
the
2nd
time
ive
had
it
and
reviewed
it
and
it
wasnt
bad
i
must
say
ng
got
a
bottle
at
the
cafe
in
the
tower
of
london
brown
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
little
lacing
to
be
had
very
sweet
aroma
of
malt
along
with
a
hint
of
sourness
medium
body
with
an
odd
flavoring
it
is
mostly
sweet
caramel
malt
with
an
underlying
sour
fruit
and
smoke
character
the
finish
is
on
the
thin
side
overall
this
beer
is
lacking
in
many
areas
but
it
is
not
terrible
overall
impression
dinged
this
one
on
the
aroma
for
the
inexcusable
skunkiness
when
will
they
ever
learn
brown
bottles
an
ok
beer
which
is
probably
a
delight
on
cask
its
aftertaste
is
quite
simple
at
first
but
grows
into
a
large
amount
of
bitterness
well
this
review
should
probably
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
three
pretty
horrible
russian
beers
i
had
before
finally
cracking
this
open
my
what
a
refreshing
change
even
the
clear
glass
bottle
didnt
seem
to
effect
the
situation
as
i
poured
this
beautiful
clear
copper
liquid
into
my
pint
glass
a
nice
offwhite
contoured
head
built
to
just
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
before
settling
at
about
one
centimeter
which
deposited
some
nice
lace
rings
as
the
liquid
descended
theres
a
nice
strong
malty
nose
with
an
enticing
touch
of
flowery
hops
the
mouth
is
prickly
and
heavy
theres
a
good
crisp
malty
opening
followed
by
a
full
hoppy
bitterness
that
leaves
a
nice
fresh
aftertaste
thanks
i
needed
that
not
bad
a
bit
too
dry
and
bitter
for
my
taste
however
impressive
it
appears
this
beer
comes
from
an
interesting
yeast
because
there
are
little
esters
in
the
nose
but
some
great
flavors
but
the
point
is
that
this
is
a
tasty
bitterale
unfortunately
watch
out
for
it
skunking
before
it
gets
to
america
due
to
their
use
of
clear
glass
must
be
unbelievable
on
draught
in
england
a
stylistic
midpoint
between
london
pride
and
anchor
liberty
perhaps
from
englands
oldest
brewery
poured
a
bownish
color
with
minimal
headkind
of
a
funky
smell
almost
skunked
and
a
little
musty
taste
is
slightly
fruity
with
some
dryness
in
the
finishpretty
drinkable
but
nothing
spectacular
its
still
nice
to
find
ales
from
the
island
across
the
pond
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
offwhite
head
some
trails
and
some
spotty
sticky
lace
medium
sweet
caramel
maltiness
sharp
bitter
and
tealike
hops
balanced
smooth
sweet
and
very
drinkable
nicely
blended
towards
the
end
nice
beer
i
drank
this
one
in
the
the
wilton
arms
pub
in
westminster
it
is
a
great
ale
but
found
it
to
be
a
little
bland
it
probably
would
have
gone
better
with
my
fish
and
chips
than
what
i
did
have
it
had
a
deep
rubybrown
color
with
some
creamy
head
it
smelled
very
full
bodied
and
as
i
said
i
found
the
taste
a
little
lacking
but
overall
it
was
a
good
bitter
and
quite
drinkable
i
hope
to
have
it
again
in
the
future
looks
very
docile
in
the
bottle
pours
a
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
which
disapates
somewhat
quickly
while
i
did
not
get
te
same
smell
noted
in
other
reviews
it
was
not
overly
very
impressive
and
inviting
as
other
beers
very
dry
taste
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
overall
a
mild
bitter
worth
a
taste
but
not
much
more
i
must
admit
the
name
of
the
beer
is
more
intriguing
than
the
beer
itself
i
just
hope
it
was
not
a
catholic
bishop
the
nuns
delight
clear
bright
amber
with
a
reddish
tint
and
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
the
body
is
moderately
light
with
a
gentle
carbonation
the
flavor
is
assertive
with
a
strong
malt
presence
and
an
assault
of
hops
the
hops
win
out
in
the
finish
leaving
it
dry
and
long
lasting
though
its
not
a
very
complex
ale
it
is
full
of
bold
malt
and
hop
an
excellent
beer
to
pair
with
english
cheeses
pretty
nasty
stuff
i
drank
it
in
england
and
it
was
still
bad
does
not
look
appealing
at
all
no
head
and
looks
like
shit
bitter
aftertaste
and
smells
like
someone
pulled
the
bishops
finger
yuuuuuuuck
pours
an
appealing
dark
amber
color
nice
pillow
head
that
lingers
for
a
bit
then
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
lace
there
are
nice
fruity
aromas
on
the
nose
as
well
as
caramel
and
or
vanilla
on
the
palate
the
flavors
really
come
through
towards
the
middle
bold
malt
flavors
fruitiness
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
notes
and
maybe
raisins
too
nice

to
it
excellent

feel
this
stuff
is
good
weird
mixed
reviewsimo
a
good
brew
i
think
its
ok
but
its
a
bit
smelly
the
body
is
thin
but
theres
some
nice
flavours
of
citrus
roasty
chocolate
in
there
i
think
its
ok
but
theres
better
stuff
from
the
mother
country
descent
but
nothing
special
slight
maltiness
slight
bitterness
and
a
unsweet
cider
quality
overalli
thought
is
was
a
bit
light
i
found
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
nothing
really
impressed
me
either
the
best
thing
it
had
going
for
it
was
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
the
bottle
is
kinda
cool
does
not
live
up
to
the
price
though
thats
for
sure
absolutely
a
classic
english
ale
beautifully
balanced
malt

i
am
excited
to
have
a
beer
from
maine
this
beer
is
okay
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
there
are
others
in
this
category
that
are
much
more
enjoyable
this
one
was
lacking
on
the
nose
and
a
little
on
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
worked
ok
but
still
wasnt
out
of
the
park
beautiful
color
the
smell
of
a
bitter
with
sweet
malty
undertones
interesting
choice
of
hops
not
quite
floral
enough
malt
balance
is
perfect
not
a
clean
hoppy
finish
but
a
tad
too
bitter
head
and
lacing
perfect
overall
a
beer
its
own
very
good
overall
pretty
average
beer
not
much
of
a
beast
like
the
label
says

it

mouthfeel
is

with

too
not
really

either
not
a
huge
fan
of
this

this
is
dissapointing
i
grabbed
one
of
these
on
a
whim
during
an
ohio
buying
trip
bur
kinda
wish
i
hadnt
this
offering
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
funky
with
lots
of
malt
and
a
very
slight
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
all
roasted
malts
and
a
little
hops
but
they
seem
very
stale
this
is
dissapointing
and
i
hope
just
a
little
old
id
try
again
if
i
knew
this
was
fresh
o
this
beer
tastes
a
little
lighter
in
body
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
tastes
a
little
like
a
hybrid
between
an
esb
and
an
irish
red
ale

is
a

a

this
is
a
fairly
well
balanced
beer
medium
in
body
and
pleasant
overall
even
if
youre
not
a
diehard
buckeye
fan
you
will
find
many
things
to
like
about
this
beer
it
may
not
rank
in
your
all
time
top
ten
for
its
style
but
there
is
certainly
enough
quality
here
to
recommend
a
sample
or
two
pours
medium
amber
with
a
1
inch
khaki
head
the
head
stays
longer
than
i
expected
over
a
minute
sweet
malty
aroma
which
turns
a
little
hoppy
at
the
end
the
hop
bitterness
seems
to
be
equally
matched
with
the
malt
here
very
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
im
quite
impressed
with
this
one
not
every
beer
needs
to
knock
your
socks
of
with
hops
and
strong
abv
this
is
just
a
plain
down
and
dirty
beer
on
a
side
note
i
do
think
the
name
is
kinda
lame
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
as
balanced
as
the
rest
though
i
can
see
where
someone
might
prefer
to
go
a
touch
creamier
and
drop
off
a
little
bit
of
the
thickness
on
the
palate
its
not
slick
but
it
comes
close
the
medium
body
holds
it
together
well
if
youre
not
a
hop
fiend
or
simply
want
a
change
of
pace
this
should
do
the
trick
not
exceptional
but
not
at
all
bad
overall
very
enjoyable
esb
kind
takes
some
of
the
best
of
an
irish
red
and
combines
it
with
a
regular
red
ale
i
like
the
mix
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
here
certainly
a
beer
i
would
do
a
six
of
if
i
was
in
the
area
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
earthiness
and
notes
of
spice
in
the
taste
a
caramel
like
roast
and
somewhat
spicy
yet
a
bit
thin
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
spice
like
aftertaste
hint
of
earth
and
some
spice
decent
and
average
medium
body
with
some
soft
carbonation
a
simple
beer
here
nothing
outstanding
in
either
direction
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
does
not
taste
like
any
esb
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
pretty
good
one
of
my
hophead
friends
really
likes
this
so
i
was
wary
he
loves
ipa
and
i
dont
this
beer
looks
good
smells
good
and
is
a
pleasure
to
the
mouth
and
tongue
it
has
a
great
balance
between
malt
and
hops
both
can
be
enjoyed
the
finish
is
clean
and
refreshing
not
as
neat
as
pilsner
urquell
or
as
malty
as
paulaner
oktoberfest
but
a
harmonious
blend
of
hops
and
malt
i
am
excited
because
it
is
also
made
right
down
the
road
in
columbus
i
will
make
a
trip
there
soon
hv
d
at
first
was
a
bit
put
off
by
the
brew
as
i
was
expecting
something
different
after
i
adjusted
my
expectation
not
a
bad
beer
nicely
balanced
crisp
finish
a
beer
you
can
easily
drink
o
this
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
based
on
the
packaging
i
thought
they
were
going
for
more
of
an
irish
red
but
apparently
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
esb
id
prefer
they
were
a
bit
more
forward
with
the
style
instead
of
leaning
heavily
on
the
status
of
the
ohio
state
university
to
sell
this
beer
overall
impression
nothing
wrong
with
an
decent
easydrinking
brew
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
d
a
fairly
priced
red
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
pretty
darn
drinkable
d
although
i
got
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
style

i
dont
care
for
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
but
would
be
better
if
that
metallic
taste
wasnt
there
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
something
id
drink
very
often
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
well
balanced
and
fairly
drinkable
with
the
mineral
quality
being
the
only
thing
that
is
a
bit
offputting
i
notice
this
is
listed
as
an
esb
which
conflicts
with
the
new
style
label
that
advertises
this
as
a
red
ale
regardless
it
was
decent
and
worth
a
try
if
you
dig
the
styles
m
dryer
than
a
sunbleached
bone
all
of
the
effervescent
is
an
indication
of
what
this
beer
might
feel
like
its
quite
prickly
overly
so
this
beer
would
be
right
in
line
with
its
english
kin
if
it
werent
for
this
drinkability
is
good
a
rich
tasty
malty
beer
i
could
see
this
in
someones
rotation
in
areas
where
this
beer
is
sold
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
if
i
could
get
this
distributed
to
my
area
i
would
be
a
six
pack
regular
pours
a
copper
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
one
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
some
pale
malts
with
hints
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
along
with
some
pale
malt
at
the
backend
is
a
slight
citrus
and
pine
hop
bite
with
a
little
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
to
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
nice
flavor
a
little
weak
aroma
the
sweetness
and
hop
bite
bring
the
middle
and
end
through
nicely
an
easy
drink
reasonably
good
drinkability
its
nothing
special
but
not
bad
i
much
prefer
their
horus
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
good
for
a
style
that
you
dont
see
much
cheers
in
the
end
its
a
nice
beer
but
the
qualities
that
make
irish
reds
great
has
a
hard
time
showing
here
bizarre
carmelly
citrus
taste
with
a
thinner
than
average
finnish
reminds
me
of
a
very
heavy
and
less
bright
killians
pours
much
thicker
but
head
has
no
retention
whatsoever
at
least
not
on
my
glass
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
average
as
well
for
some
reason
i
expected
more
of
a
candybar
feel
drinkability
is
simply
average
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
they
themselves
can
do
much
better
drinkability
a
good
beer
with
solid
yet
tame
flavors
by
far
the
best
beer
at
the
restaurant
i
was
in
my
wife
had
a
killians
irish
red
and
it
tasted
like
water
next
to
this
one
drinkability
is
outstanding
ill
probably
have
to
get
growlers
of
this
since
thats
the
only
way
i
know
of
apart
from
ontap
that
they
sell
it
in
drinkability
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
for
the
swilling
needs
well
worth
a
revisit
one
day
i
had
a
pint
of
this
beer
at
luckys
on
court
street
in
downtown
athens
oh
it
pours
a
nice
scarlet
red
with
a
good
head
it
tasted
like
a
fresh
microbrew
should
it
was
hoppy
but
not
so
overpowering
it
was
smooth
with
a
lasting
tang
then
a
quick
finish
it
was
a
great
accompaniment
to
the
italian
sub
it
was
served
with
what
a
great
paring
if
you
are
ever
in
athens
stop
by
and
grab
a
bite
and
a
buckeye
red
overall
id
gladly
pick
this
one
up
again
although
ive
tasted
stronger
ales
and
have
other
favorites
at
the
elevator
d
very
drinkable
beer
well
being
a
psu
fan
in
columbus
was
hoping
for
the
buckeyes
to
bleed
a
bit
but
wasnt
the
case
that
day
but
an
apropos
name
nonetheless
a
solid
beer
and
one
that
id
probably
have
again
should
i
be
in
the
neighborhood
elevator
changed
the
name
on
this
one
from
bott
brothers
esb
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
scaring
customers
away
with
the
word
bitter
and
to
cash
in
on
osu
whatever
on
draught
at
players
sports
bar
in
the
adams
mark
hotel
in
downtown
columbus
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fairly
hoppy
with
malt
undertones
mediumbodied
and
really
not
all
that
bitter
after
all
slightly
sweet
finish
after
you
get
through
the
initial
hops
aftertaste
not
a
great
beer
but
i
wish
every
hotel
bar
had
an
option
like
this
this
is
a
new
name
for
the
former
esb
the
publican
rita
told
me
that
they
had
to
change
the
name
because
too
many
people
would
not
try
something
with
the
name
extra
special
bitter
bitter
this
is
not
in
fact
it
tends
more
to
its
malt
side
than
the
bittering
hops
it
has
a
good
flavor
indeed
and
is
quite
drinkable
the
look
is
of
clear
amber
under
an
ivory
head
it
shows
good
lacing
effect
and
is
smooth
on
the
palate
a
good
refreshing
beer
that
is
none
the
less
for
its
name
this
beer
poured
out
a
medium
amber
color
formed
a
white
head
with
a
decent
lace
even
if
the
head
subsided
more
than
i
would
like
light
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
body
for
an
esb
i
would
consider
it
too
sweet
for
an
esb
but
not
bad
as
a
side
note
they
offered
to
make
it
a
sour
apple
esb
by
adding
the
necessary
liqour
if
you
look
at
an
earlier
beerfly
review
of
flavored
beer
here
i
am
not
happy
with
this
trend
as
i
said
before
last
i
checked
that
was
not
how
its
done
dark
slightly
hoppy
great
feel
t
nice
toffee
and
malt
biscuit
character
treacle
comes
to
mind
not
overly
aggressively
sweet
has
an
aged
portlike
flavor
of
dried
raisins
apple
pear
spicy
hop
notes
woody
cinnamon
nuanced
chocolate
hobgoblin
isnt
quite
my
favourite
esb
but
it
definitely
stands
out
from
the
crowd
probably
the
best
beer
wychwood
have
to
offer
mehsoso
beer
not
baddont
need
to
drink
it
againunless
youre
visiting
the
shire
with
gandalf
the
grey
and
frodo
baggins
overall
tons
of
flavors
and
good
freshness
well
balanced
excellent
craft
prost
i
have
a
new
segment
where
my
fiance
takes
a
sip
of
my
beer
and
reviews
shes
more
of
a
cidermead
fan
but
she
tries
slightly
dry
but
balanced
this
has
some
really
interesting
flavors
happening
it
looks
nice
smells
of
candy
and
has
plenty
of
layers
in
the
mouth
burnt
grains
toffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
combine
nicely
with
some
bitter
hops
to
finish
things
off
it
is
clear
that
this
recipe
has
stood
the
test
of
time
overall
its
a
fairly
average
esb
its
an
import
so
im
willing
to
try
it
again
if
i
can
get
it
fresh
it
didnt
have
as
much
of
a
caramel
overtone
as
many
other
esbs
that
ive
had
but
it
has
a
nice
biscuit
quality
which
is
pleasant
enough
to
make
it
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
its
in
that
middle
ground
of
not
recommending
but
not
warning
against
drinking
really
nice
cool
looking
beer
lacks
smell
but
taste
amazing
good
beer
classic
dark
english
a
bit
fruity
barley
winish
great
tasting
beer
very
enjoyable
i
really
enjoyed
this
ruby
fantastic
beerthank
you
pours
a
dark
brown
amber
with
a
thin
creamy
head
smells
are
faint
but
has
a
malt
backbone
there
is
a
mild
taste
of
raisins
and
sweet
malt
kind
of
leaning
towards
a
mild
barleywine
there
is
a
little
syrup
in
the
mouthfeel
with
mild
carbonation
overall
a
beer
that
is
a
little
complex
but
very
drinkable
i
dont
usually
get
excited
about
a
beers
aroma
but
this
one
really
stands
out
it
has
as
much
complexity
as
a
lot
of
bigger
beers
superior
drinkabilty
i
could
drink
this
all
day
enjoyed
2115
for
first
time
in
very
long
time
consistency
upheld
good
beer
thats
reminiscent
of
a
kolsch
or
even
a
heineken
decent
interesting
but
just
so
so
a
bit
malty
and
sudsy
body
is
a
bit
light
carbonation
is
at
good
level
its
just
a
three
not
all
that
rosted
flavor
deep
brown
color
light

half
finger
head
deep
redishbrown
pour
with
clingy
white
head
nose
is
all
malt
and
slight
caramel
bright
semisweet
body
with
lingering
malty
finish
very
smooth
and
way
too
drinkable
a
classic
english
bitter
which
comes
across
with
big
toffee
and
nutty
notes
light
and
thin
in
mouthfeel
goes
down
very
easily
with
enough
a
faint
hop
presence
to
keep
things
ticking
along
nice
flavour
after
taste
to
sharp
nice
malty
taste
interesting
undertones
not
too
bitter
despite
name
please
ignore
this
not
review
overall
this
is
an
interesting
dark
ale
there
are
a
lot
of
subtle
flavors
in
this
beer
and
it
doesnt
have
the
bite
at
the
end
that
many
dark
ales
tend
to
have
has
a
slight
malt
smell
a
little
sweet
with
maybe
nut
not
a
strong
smell
taste
was
bland
would
have
preferred
a
lot
more
malt
a
little
toasted
bread
with
a
bitter
dry
finish
overall
i
would
say
only
okay
with
not
a
lot
to
offer
i
will
not
be
having
this
one
again
unless
there
were
severely
limited
choices
a
bit
drab
and
tasteless
used
to
like
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
used
to
overall
a
really
enjoyable
esb
for
me
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
nice
beer
with
a
bitterness
i
wasnt
expecting
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
an
odd
flavor
profile
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
prefer
a
maltier
nuttier
brown
ale
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
wouldnt
be
compelled
to
stock
up
on
this
one
maybe
not
as
rounded
as
the
esb
from
fullers
but
still
a
great
sweet
ale
to
be
tasted
on
a
night
like
this
as
the
winter
is
actually
coming
great
love
it
one
of
the
first
i
tried
i
drink
this
beer
a
bit
rose
tinted
but
overall
i
still
think
its
a
very
solid
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
flavors
with
some
floral
notes
from
the
hops
the
taste
has
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
notes
well
balanced
by
the
floral
hops
making
for
a
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
clear
brown
creamy
lacey
head
malty
coffee
aroma
deep
dark
bitter
chocolate
flavour
slight
coffee
and
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
overall
enjoyable
beer
not
an
everyday
drinker
for
me
but
highly
recommended
toasted
lightly
fruity
aroma
vegetal
flavor
with
a
tangy
character
thats
offputting
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
tiny
amount
of
sweetness
at
the
end
o
a
fine
esb
overall
i
cannot
pretend
this
beer
is
anything
other
than
outstanding
it
has
a
brilliant
flavour
profile
with
excellent
balance
and
it
is
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
it
is
simply
perfect
for
those
long
autumn
and
winter
nights
with
a
roaring
fire
and
plate
of
roasted
pork
ribs
or
a
cheese
platter
i
just
tried
this
and
its
fall
close
to
halloween
in
new
york
state
and
its
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
the
color
is
evocative
of
the
season
the
flavors
complement
the
weather
especially
the
cool
nights
and
its
just
fun
drinking
a
beer
called
hob
goblin
in
october
this
is
a
very
nice
strong
ale
from
england
pleasant
scent
and
sweet
finish
are
the
most
impressive
part
to
me

this

brew
i

not

i
was

nothing
really
unpleasant
here
just
nothing
pleasant
for

either
i
could
drink
it
just
wasnt
a
particular
enjoyment
to
do
so
for
me
the
biggest
drawback
to
the

is
its
sharp
fizzy
carbonation
together
with
the
lemon
bitterness
it
can
wear
out

the

problem
to
me

i
dont
smell
much
maybe
some
caramel
in
the
mouth
i
find
it
a
bit
watery
taste
of
caramels
the
same
limestone
and
some
medicinal
thing
esay
drink
but
nothing
more
that
would
make
me
want
to
repeat

drinking

not
a

that
i

multiple
mouthfeel
is
great
for
the
style
taste
this
beer
is
light
on
malty
flavor
which
lets
the
flowery
hops
dominate
much
of
the
experience
d
very
drinkable
for
my

wouldnt

to
have
too
many
in

it

maybe
some

but
not

brown
ale
ive

d
not
one
i
will
go
back
to
especially
for
the
price
the
flavor
and
feel
are
more
along
the
lines
of
the
mild

the
feel
of
this

ill
have
again

had
this
a

times
from

insisted
i

try
it

it

an
english
brown
medium
mouthfeel
this
definitely
stands
out
among
english
brown
ales
for
my
personal
preferences
im
not
sure
it
is
for
the
better
but
it
is
still
an
interesting
and
well
crafted
beer
that
many
may
enjoy
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
red
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aromas
of
steaming
butter
and
sweet
dark
fruits
a
bit
chocolatey
as
well
a
very
promising
nose
a
rich
and
interesting
flavor
sweet
fruity
and
toffeeish
malts
are
dominant
faint
hops
bring
up
the
rear
those
hops
need
to
speak
up
a
little
more
to
give
this
beer
some
balance
but
with
that
said
i
enjoy
its
offkilter
taste
a
smooth
fullbodied
brew
whose
presentation
is
beautiful
to
behold
and
almost
as
fun
to
drink
this
beer
pours
with
a
great
amount
of
head
and
reduces
to
a
great
amount
of
lacing
the
ruby
red
brown
beer
gives
a
great
aroma
and
taste
as
the
aroma
greats
the
nose
with
brown
sugars
caramel
and
malts
a
great
balance
has
been
found
within
this
beer
for
the
aftertaste
it
leaves
a
wonderful
taste
if
a
bit
dry
a
very
nice
beer
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
has
a
nice
rich
malt
presense
that
i
feel
lacks
in
many
brown
ales
truly
representative
of
an
english
brown
ale
definitely
have
again
wychwood
hobgoblin
is
a
very
clear
reddish
brown
ale
with
a
creamy
dense
yellowbeige
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
leaves
thick
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
looks
perfect
the
aroma
is
nutty
and
a
little
sweet
it
has
a
roasty
quality
and
there
may
be
a
note
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
it
smells
slightly
herbal
and
medicinal
and
very
english
it
is
mediumlight
bodied
very
smooth
with
a
dry
slightly
scratchy
finish
its
a
simple
flavor
thats
very
pulled
together
its
slightly
sweet
slightly
bitter
and
perhaps
a
touch
sour
there
may
be
a
little
nuttiness
this
is
very
sessionable
clear
orangebrown
color
bright
presence
in
the
glass
with
a
large
loose
head
of
large
quick
to
pop
bubbles
above
average
lacing
the
nose
has
an
admirable
balance
between
malts
and
hops
even
with
light
cocoa
powder
and
dark
fruits
could
pass
for
a
pilsner
with
its
grains
straw
and
tobacco
wrapper
lightbodied
quite
smooth
with
a
creamy
texture
given
its
lack
of
heft
mixed
berry
nuts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
however
in
no
way
sweet
here
malt
dominates
the
attack
with
hops
gaining
the
lead
through
the
finish
the
high
level
of
carbonation
doesnt
disturb
the
flavor
clarity
fits
the
weight
and
keeps
the
brew
refreshing
a
floral
side
comes
through
with
the
aftertaste
very
tactful
and
easy
to
consume
drinkability
definitely
sessionable
for
sure
interesting
and
complex
enough
to
not
get
bored
with
it
especially
if
starting
off
cold
and
seeing
how
it
progresses
as
it
warms
up
overall
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
tasty
with
a
longer
hop
presence
at
the
end
definitely
drinkable
and
would
make
an
enjoyable
session
beer
thought
the
abv
is
technically
a
little
high
this
was
probably
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
so
id
revisit
this
one
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
can
see
myself
getting
some
more
of
this
when
i
am
looking
for
a
brown
ale
it
represents
the
style
quite
well
the
body
is
pretty
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
ranks
high
on
my
drinkability
meter
interesting
smell
unique
flavor
and
low
abv
good
combo
d
a
great
session
beer
granted
its
not
trying
to
mask
a
terribly
high
abv
but
it
still
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
while
remaining
quite
drinkable
pours
a
rubymahogany
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
left
moderate
lacing
malty
smell
that
was
smooth
on
the
taste
buds
with
mild
bitterness
to
finish
very
smooth
and
balanced
but
hobgoblin
is
an
unispiring
brew
for
me
i
just
felt
that
one
was
enough
and
it
was
time
to
move
on
to
something
else
pours
a
very
deep
ruby
red
with
about
a
two
finger
tan
coloured
head
that
slowly
settles
smells
of
chocolate
and
biscuits
and
a
bit
fruity
the
taste
is
buttery
malt
and
chocolate
accompanied
with
a
nice
level
of
bitterness
nice
lacing
that
follows
the
beer
to
the
end
of
the
glass
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
very
well
balanced
i
would
definately
grab
this
again
merry

conclusion
a

english
brown
fresh
on
tap
is
even
better
than
out
of

drinkability
the
consistency
of
the
taste
and
the
mild
nuttiness
make
this
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
not
the
best
out
there
but
a
worthy
choice
midfull

okay
carbonation
i
like
this
beer

a
little

sweet

more

this

good
brew
this
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
other
brewer
that
uses
similar
bottles
and
similar
art
to
cover
up
the
crap
inside

for
an

note
mine
came
in
a
brown
bottle
not
the
clear
bottle
as
pictured
above
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
its
a
nice
example
of
the
style
if
you
are
into
english
ales
i
would
recommend
this
for
sure
dvery
drinkable
beer
maybe
not
the
greatest
but
one
that
i
go
back
to
occassionally
for
a
changeup
to
the
old
and
familiar
i
love
the
500
ml
bottles
the
perfect

d
very
good
beer
and
very

poured
from
a

bottle
a
deep
brown
and
ruby
red
in
color
with
a
decent
foamy
off
white
head
that
disapated
to
a
swirly
lather
the
lacing
left
on
the
glass
was
splattered
like
paint
spots
smell
of
toasted
malts
and
caramel
taste
similar
to
the
smell
with
some
slight
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
not
much
carbonation
and
very
reminescent
to
an
englishstyle
brew
nice
brown
ale
and
worth
trying
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
with
almost
no
head
it
smelled
like
subtle
roasted
barley
with
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
oak
it
tasted
like
molasses
and
bittersweet
chocolate
and
earthy
barley
with
some
creamy
yeast
and
a
bit
of
copper
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
pretty
good
flavor
and
body
it
was
still
kind
of
dirty
but
it
was
easy
to
drink
this
was
the
best
wychwood
ive
tried
but
thats
not
saying
much
id
like
to
try
this
with
a
nutty
cheese
maybe
gruyere
on
the
palate
hobgoblin
has
a
smooth
brown
ale
flavor
its
full
without
overpowering
while
its
a
darker
beer
its
pleasingly
light
on
the
finish
definitely
make
me
want
to
enjoy
another
and
leaves
a
slight
lingering
note
of
hobs
nothing
terribly
complex
going
on
and
certainly
could
be
enjoyed
as
a
session
beer
if
that
is
your
budget
allows
drinkability
a
could
drink
these
all
night
i
hesitate
giving
it
a
5
just
because
im
new
to
beer
drinking
but
its
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
drinking
not
the
most
complex
taste
but
a
very
satisfying
beer
i
wish
now
i
didnt
share
my
bottle
with
a
friend
came
in
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
frothy
onefinger
tan
head
that
slowly
died
and
left
some
lace
patches
had
mild
smells
of
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
with
a
hint
of
herbalness
and
more
sweet
malts
mildy
sweet
not
overbearing
the
cocoa
and
coffee
are
subdued
real
smooth
almost
slick
with
a
little
bit
of
creaminess
and
no
dryness
to
it
as
it
passes
down
easily
and
enjoyable
hints
of
caramel
andor
butterscotch
around
the
backend
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
have
sometimes
all
in
all
a
delicious
and
very
drinkable
dark
english
ale
notes
very
unique
in
the
sense
that
it
was
brewed
with
a
lot
of
thought
flavors
that
pound
the
tongue
and
make
themselves
present
in
every
sip
overall
a
well
balanced
beer

brew
pours
a
wonderful
rich

brown
with
a
hefty
tan
head
that
retains
very
well
aromoas
of
very
rich
malts
slight
chocolate
and
hintss
of
maple
and
toasted
nuts
flavor
is
maltolicious
thick
chewy
and
packed
with
sweetness
balanced
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
middle
slight
hints
of
yeeasta
tiny
butterscotch
note
but
predominantly
the
malts
produce
tons
of
rich
flavor
this
beer
has
low
carbonation
which
makes
it
very
very
smoothalmost
creamy
in
the
mouth
ridiculously
smooth
and
very
fullbodied
in
flavor
its
a
heavy
brew
but
very
drinkable
this
will
be
a
constant
in
my
house
for
certain
drinkability
i
think
you
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
very
light
if
you
have
the
money
id
go
these
over
every
crappy
macrocrap
for
a
party
id

to
see
this
in

dark
ale
that
i
will

again

i
remember
drinking
this
some
years

really
enjoying
it

i
would
gladly
drink
another
d
this
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
with
a
interesting
complexity
in
the
taste
and
smell
it
reminds
me
of
cask
beer
and
i
bet
it
would
be
amazing
if
it
were
served
on
cask
poured
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
copper
brown
in
color
with
a
two
finger
milky
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
caramel
and
slightly
nutty
taste
is
also
sweet
with
a
toasted
malty
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
fairly
hoppy
dry
finish
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
creamy
carbonation
chewy
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
english
brown
ale
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
for
a
session
or
two
or
three
or
very
pleasant
brew
it
pours
very
smooth
and
has
a
deep
dark
brown
look
when
it
is
poured
it
is
just
as
smooth
as
you
drink
it
and
with
a
slight
chocolate
taste
to
it
feels
perfect
for
a
late
calm
evening
brew
its
all
round
a
dark
deep
and
rich
just
as
a
good
english
brown
ale
should
be
all
around
a
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
head
subdued
malt
with
little
hop
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
wet
cask
some
biscuit
comes
through
in
the
flavor
both
at
the
beginning
and
the
finish
very
light
carbonation
gives
a
smooth
mouthfeel
when
i
started
drinking
i
thought
it
was
an
excellent
session
beer
after
a
few
tastes
i
revised
the
drinkability
downward
because
of
a
kind
of
wet
dog
aftertaste
that
builds
up
over
time
the
clear
very
attractive
bottle
may
have
allowed
some
skunkiness
to
build
up
but
it
is
just
at
the
threshold
of
my
perception
as
a
side
note
ive
had
both
the
hobgoblin
and
fiddlers
elbow
before
in
the
old
clear
bottles
and
they
always
had
at
least
a
little
skunk
to
them
i
have
just
had
both
in
the
new
brown
bottles
and
its
a
world
of
difference
ill
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
of
this
one
if
you
were
unhappy
with
this
one
in
a
clear
bottle
give
it
another
try
in
the
brown
you
wont
be
disappointed
somewhat
drinkable
but
a
little
sticky
and
bland
for
my
taste
as
mentioned
before
this
is
by
no
means
a
great
beer
it
is
however
a
decent
enough
drinker
and
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
enjoying
another
one
from
time
to
time
same
in
the
aftertaste
with
even
some
roasted
hint
licorice
and
dried
frutis
quite
long
the
name
and
the
transparent
bottle
has
kept
me
away
from
this
beer
for
a
long
time
but
recently
my
wife
bought
one
by
mistake
she
was
looking
for
scottish
beer
in
edinburgh
and
returned
with
it
im
ashamed
to
admit
it
poured
with
a
darkish
redbrown
color
a
small
amount
of
foam
settled
quickly
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
sweet
bread
herbs
and
citrus
the
bitter
ipaish
taste
was
of
sweet
oranges
with
bread
notes
maybe
a
hint
of
that
advertized
chocolate
too
i
did
not
think
i
would
like
this
beer
but
i
actually
do
it
was
refreshing
but
seemed
confused
like
a
roller
coaster
it
peaked
early
then
all
downhill
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
didnt
really
impress
or
wow
me
it
did
go
well
with
my
burger
fries
i
would
recommend
trying
it
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
nothing
else
caught
my
eyes
and
tastebuds
overall
the
flavors
and
aromas
arent
extremely
bold
or
complex
but
distinct
and
clean
easy
drinking
and
tasty
i
had
no
problem
ordering
more
than
one
of
these
tonight
problem
at
this
location
is
that
it
has
serious
competition
on
tap
next
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
retry
but
for
me
they
just
fell
short
of
perfection
by
trying
to
be
too
many
things
at
once
the
beer
is
smooth
silk
like
yet
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
yeasty
finish
a
solid
english
ale
all
around
this
one
seemed
like
it
was
missing
some
of
the
characteristics
that
i
usually
find
in
english
brown
ales
it
also
seemed
a
little
bland
and
watered
down
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
pretty
good
not
a
bad
brew
that
i
may
purchase
again
da
not
exactly
hard
to
drink
very
drinkable
in
my
book
still
prefer
the
draught
but
after
a
hard
days
work
and
3
hours
on
a
university
course
and
then
a
drive
home
this
beer
did
the
trick
and
i
was
normal
again
half
way
through
it
when
i
first
spotted
this
beer
i
thought
this
would
be
a
winner
but
i
really
wasnt
impress
nice
ruby
red
pour
w
a
hint
of
toffee
and
maple
syrup
but
that
is
about
all
for
this
brew
sweet
start
and
ending
w
not
enough
body
or
taste
remember
this
is
only
my
opinion
drinkability
good
perhaps
a
bit
less
robust
than
the
label
boasted
but
a
solid
brown
ale
even
skunked
i
find
this
is
a
likeable
beer
but
it
could
be
much
more
d
session
session
session
thats
this
beers
calling
and
for
my
tastes
its
only
good
purpose
this
beer
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
was
malty
sweet
and
slightly
floral
the
taste
is
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
thick
or
chewy
id
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
clockwork
compared
to
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
lighterthanexpected
brown
with
ruby
and
golden
highlights
well
carbonated
and
shows
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
tap
blends
the
flavors
into
a
very
suble
yet
heavied
sweetness
hiding
the
chocolates
fruits
and
nutty
flavors
the
flavors
take
on
malty
sweetness
without
the
differentiating
flavors
that
i
noticed
in
the
bottle
though
nice
smooth
and
malty
rich
the
character
is
a
bit
empty
without
the
individual
flavors
and
fruitiness
noticed
but
this
wont
keep
me
from
trying
another
original

it

i
may

rr
ty
wychwood
seems
to
have
a
problem
their
marketing
is
easily
able
to
sell
the
first
bottle
but
for
me
at
least
theyve
never
been
able
to
seal
the
deal
and
sell
me
the
second
one
i
might
sample
their
other
varieties
but
i
cant
say
ill
ever
be
on
the
lookout
for
one
of
their
beers
worth
a
try
i
suppose
but
colour
me
generally
unimpressed
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
tart
to
session
however
this
doesnt
linger
after
the
drink
is
done
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
that
gets
a
bit
too
tart
at
times
but
still
moderatly
drinkable
id
buy
again
but
only
if
it
was
not
in
summer
it
and
the
styles
unique
taste
pallette
offer
something
different
than
what
i
can
get
up
here
normally
and
for
this
i
am
grateful
the
nose
promises
a
lot
but
the
taste
doesnt
really
live
up
to
it
it
is
drinkable
but
for
9
au
it
is
not
worth
it
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
very
mellow
roasted
cocoa
dark
chocolate
caramel
butter
nuts
fruitcake
almost
a
bit
christmassy
hop
character
is
extremely
mild
theres
a
slight
metallic
acidity
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
it
all
but
if
not
for
that
and
the
roasted
flavour
this
would
be
way
too
sweet
for
my
liking
fortunately
its
not
that
bad
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
extremely
creamy
with
a
mild
carbonation
i
find
this
a
refreshing
change
from
so
many
thinbodied
english
ales
maybe
a
bit
sweet
but
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
reddish
brown
color
and
i
have
to
give
it
an
extra
half
point
for
the
label
smells
a
little
woody
with
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
buttery
smell
as
well
it
tastes
like
an
average
brown
ale
nice
and
mallty
with
low
hop
character
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
really
easily
it
leaves
a
slight
aftertaste
nothing
overpowering
and
all
it
does
is
make
you
want
to
take
another
sip
my
overall
opinion
is
that
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
that
i
would
probably
buy
again
easy
to
drink
and
just
as
tasty
in
a
can
as
the
bottle
a
quality
english
brown
flavors
are
are
complex
and
tasty
definitely
recommended
smell
nothing
special
the
taste
is
a
malty
caramel
with
some
background
plums
maybe
a
little
thin
in
the
body
and
extremely
drinkable
i
will
get
this
again
lightbodied
but
not
watery
very
nice
finish
on
the
palate
and
the
hops
strong
as
they
are
are
nicely
held
in
check
by
the
malt
excellent
session
beer
hobgoblin
is
among
my
favorite
dark
english
ales
but
as
i
noted
in
the
begining
this
is
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
definitely
worth
a
try
no
matter
what
your
tastes
are
poured
a
dark
red
color
with
a
good
1
inch
head
that
stuck
to
the
glass
aroma
was
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
but
not
much
else
taste
was
malty
chocolatey
and
caramelly
with
a
faint
hint
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
kind
of
light
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
smoothness
and
the
overall
light
body
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
but
if
offered
a
pint
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
that
promises
an
excellent
beer
a
promise
which
is
definitely
fulfilled
this
beer
is
typically
considered
an
esb
and
not
a
brown
ale
i
strongly
disagree
with
its
classification
here
despite
the
color
the
taste
is
rich
with
spicy
hops
hints
of
citrus
till
it
almost
dances
on
the
tongue
very
refreshing
and
with
a
full
developed
and
mature
taste
not
normally
found
in
this
sort
of
beer
from
22
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
good
head
pleasant
aroma
though
hard
to
describe
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
very
tasty
and
a
great
finish
despite
the
clear
bottle
which
im
still
not
sure
why
they
use
this
beer
with
the
funny
label
has
a
great
taste
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
well
done
english
brown
ale
i
will
enjoy
this
one
again
overall
a
decent
english
brown
ale
very
samuel
smith
like
and
a
beer
i
wouldnt
hesitate
having
again
this
came
in
a
500ml
brown
bottle
that
cost
3
99
an
ok
but
not
very
great
beer
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
was
all
sweet
malt
fair
taste
toffee
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
good
as
was
drinkability
but
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
i
enjoyed
fiddlers
elbow
more
nice
enough
beer
to
look
at
dark
brown
with
a
splotchybubbly
creme
coloured
head
aroma
for
me
is
very
very
light
malty
least
its
not
horrible
flavour
is
malty
and
slightly
fruity
slight
hopping
doesnt
have
they
typical
flavoursome
tastes
that
most
englishh
made
esbs
have
its
quite
dull
really
palte
is
alright
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
drinkable
but
i
am
very
dissapointed
for
me
the
fiddlers
elbow
was
better
and
2
a
bottle
cheaper
i
will
stick
to
black
sheep
for
my
english
beer
drinking
pleasure
up
here
in
salem
for
something
different
give
it
a
try
its
quite
tasty
and
reasonably
priced
tastes
of
dark
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
mingle
with
the
maltyness
of
ale
a
new
take
on
the
concept
of
bitter
to
a
newbie
like
me
it
isnt
drinkable
in
that
its
not
a
watery
lite
beer
you
can
just
chug
down
with
little
difficulty
the
flavour
is
so
vibrant
that
you
need
to
sip
it
despite
how
difficult
it
was
for
me
to
finish
the
bottle
i
would
reccomend
it
for
its
powerfully
distinct
taste
alone
hobgoblin
poured
a
brown
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
small
off
white
head
from
a
clear
bottle
the
aroma
is
nutty
a
bit
of
caramel
is
noticeable
too
tastes
okay
nutty
flavor
is
present
nothing
particularly
exciting
about
this
beer
nothing
really
bad
either
an
average
brown
ale
worth
a
try
a
simple
example
of
the
style
but
just
because
something
is
simple
doesnt
mean
you
shouldnt
try
it
for
yourself
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
pleasant
surprise
recommended
poured
a
semiopaque
brown
color
with
rust
colored
highlights
and
a
billowing
offwhite
colored
head
that
left
some
nice
rings
of
lacing
behind
in
my
glass
aromas
of
alcohol
toffee
malt
and
caramel
were
detectable
the
taste
was
somewhat
creamy
with
malt
sweetness
followed
quickly
by
fruitderived
sweetness
with
a
subtle
toffee
caramel
notes
underneath
the
finish
was
dry
and
slightly
bitter
easy
to
drink
but
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
after
the
1st
glass
making
it
harder
to
drink
the
entire
bottle
overall
this
beer
seemed
more
like
a
combination
of
old
ale
and
english
brown
ale
styles
i
found
it
more
pleasant
at
a
cool
temperature
not
frigerator
temperature
but
definitely
above
room
temp
warm
enough
to
bring
out
the
creaminess
but
cool
enough
to
temper
the
bitterness
and
open
hoppiness
if
that
makes
sense
pours
a
clear
dark
cola
brown
under
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
slowly
leaving
nice
spots
and
strings
the
nice
spicey
nose
iwth
caramel
and
plum
is
very
enticing
indeed
the
mouth
is
well
but
not
excessively
carbonated
and
fairly
light
the
taste
is
characterized
by
smooth
sweet
caramel
and
plum
wiht
maybe
a
touch
of
grape
the
hops
are
very
subdued
generating
just
the
beginnings
of
dryness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
good
refreshing
tasty
brew
worthy
of
a
few
pints
deasy
to
drink
and
another
would
be
welcomed
an
excellent
gift
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
a
fantastic
interpretation
of
brown
ale
it
has
entered
into
the
rotation
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
ever
pours
tamely
the
ruby
highlighted
amber
beer
is
topped
with
a
sand
and
khaki
colored
head
made
up
of
fine
and
medium
bubbles
that
slowly
settle
leaving
moderate
lacing
and
a
smattering
of
floating
head
dust
the
smell
is
vacant
faintly
of
mild
hops
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
are
present
along
with
some
restrained
chocolate
interlaced
the
finish
is
tame
relaxed
hop
spice
tones
and
doesnt
linger
kind
of
like
the
party
guest
who
shows
up
eats
some
food
and
then
leaves
youre
left
scratching
your
head
wondering
if
they
actually
came
or
if
you
only
imagined
it
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
punctuated
with
some
prickly
carbonation
medium
bodied
with
a
little
bit
of
heft
behind
it
this
was
an
enjoyable
english
ale
and
a
welcome
diversion
from
the
standard
bitters
all
together
a
decent
brew
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
lots
of
character
for
a
52
beer
this
is
a
nice
english
session
ale
edit
im
getting
some
oxidation
from
it
as
i
finish
it
but
im
not
modifying
the
review
unfortunately
every
other
bottle
ive
had
has
been
terribly
skunked
mouth
feel
is
light
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
an
intriguing
brown
very
balanced
and
certainly
not
devoid
of
flavors
even
though
it
took
me
a
while
to
pick
up
on
some
of
the
elements
boy
was
i
happy
to
see
this
on
cask
the
pour
presented
a
nice
mediumdark
brown
beer
nice
and
clear
with
a
soft
head
resting
on
top
the
nose
presented
some
funkiness
dirty
socks
with
a
hint
of
roasted
maltchocolate
but
really
not
much
at
all
the
taste
was
pedestrian
not
much
going
on
a
very
slight
malty
backbone
with
some
fairly
uninteresting
flavors
going
on
no
alcohol
kick
at
all
just
a
bland
brown
ale
you
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
as
almost
a
session
beer
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
tops
in
its
class
this
was
ok
but
nothing
immense
to
seek
out
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
light
caramel
applejuice
colored
brew
which
gives
little
in
the
way
of
head
or
smell
it
tastes
of
light
but
full
flavored
caramel
malt
with
a
unique
robustness
there
is
a
subtle
apple
fruitiness
and
spicy
hops
clench
the
finish
very
drinkable
there
is
definately
something
special
about
this
beer
but
most
days
id
take
a
sam
smith
nut
brown
for
about
the
same
price
per
serving
drinkable
but
just
didnt
pull
together
the
way
i
know
this
ale
can
on
cask
im
sure
the
clear
bottle
aint
helping
the
cause
poured
a
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
a
little
boring
looking
smell
is
a
bit
malty
with
no
skunk
which
is
definitely
a
bonus
taste
is
good
complex
raisins
and
light
prunes
certainly
very
nice
its
not
overly
carbonated
and
holds
its
flavor
all
the
way
through
this
is
easy
going
down
not
bad
at
all
just
had
this
one
on
nitrous
draught
at
otters
pub
in
torrington
ct
very
smooth
and
drinkable
nice
malty
start
with
some
hops
thrown
in
at
the
end
but
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
maltysweeter
side
far
superior
to
the
bottle
version
will
definitely
have
thos
one
again
good
stuff
this
is
just
a
good
honest
english
ale
welcome
at
my
table
anytime
i
get
some
hoppiness
among
the
roasted
flavors
but
not
much
by
any
means
minimal
esters
so
the
light
maltbased
flavors
can
shine
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
refreshing
this
beer
was
considering
the
heavy
smell
i
was
greeted
with
it
started
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
finished
with
a
crisp
bitterness
with
a
slight
alcoholic
aftertaste
it
had
a
lively
carbonation
without
being
too
bubbly
all
in
all
a
pleasant
brew
pours
dark
amber
not
much
headand
minimal
lacing
not
much
of
a
smell
here
light
malts
and
that
about
it
mouthfeel
is
lightalmost
waterywith
a
bit
of
carbanation
taste
is
light
and
malty
from
start
to
finish
it
seems
like
they
could
have
done
more
with
this
beer
light
and
bubbling
head
off
white
in
color
with
spotty
lacing
the
color
looks
great
its
a
ruby
red
and
clear
would
of
liked
more
from
the
aroma
the
aroma
is
faint
with
hints
of
malt
and
bread
finish
has
a
real
bitterness
but
goes
down
smooth
and
dry
no
real
hop
character
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
id
like
it
to
be
a
bit
thicker
tastes
of
raisinsmaltand
bread
an
average
brown
ale
it
is
very
drinkable
however
finish
leaves
a
puckering
bitterness
after
awhile
drinkability

i
would
expect
a
beer
in
this
style
to
be
a
little
more
mild
and
balanced
more
sticky
sweet
and
tart
that
i
like
in
a
drinkable
english
beer
good
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
creamy
palate
that
sticks
around
enjoyably
ill
have
this
one
again
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
year
round
a
nonoffensive
brew
this
is
a
good
session
beer
but
not
something
id
want
for
a
special
occasion
pours
with
a
nice
head
with
big
frothy
bubbles
and
a
nice
caramel
color
the
nose
is
filled
with
spicy
cookie
fragrances
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
bitter
than
expected
but
nothing
assertive
the
slightly
sweet
malt
flavor
mixes
with
the
unassertive
hops
to
create
something
very
mild
and
drinkable
a
brew
that
can
be
consumed
in
many
pints
over
an
evening
i
bet
this
would
be
better
on
tap
pours
flat
with
very
little
head
is
amber
milk
chocolate
in
color
smells
of
carmel
coffee
and
chocolate
are
apparent
tastes
somewhat
watery
but
you
can
pick
out
the
nutty
flavors
with
chocolate
and
malts
i
like
this
brown
ale
about
most
that
i
have
had
cheers
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
and
would
indeed
make
for
a
good
session
nothing
terrific
stands
out
about
it
but
it
also
was
not
lacking
in
any
key
way
enjoyable
but
i
will
more
likely
than
not
stick
to
other
perhaps
more
local
examples
of
the
style
i
e
old
brown
dog
there
is
a
slight
toffee
like
malty
taste
much
like
the
bottles
boasts
however
i
didnt
detect
any
chocolate
or
any
other
flavor
that
stood
out
there
was
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
in
there
pours
a
transparent
auburn
with
a
light
offwhite
head
nose
is
pretty
faint
with
butter
and
caramel
sweetness
coming
through
taste
is
not
really
what
i
expected
much
lighter
and
easy
drinking
than
i
had
envisioned
with
a
soft
flavor
profile
and
somewhat
fizzy
mouthfeel
im
pretty
sure
this
bottle
was
at
least
partially
light
stricken
because
im
really
not
finding
much
going
on
here
besides
a
light
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
puckering
bitterness
that
i
dont
really
think
is
natural
ill
have
to
come
back
to
this
if
they
ever
start
using
colored
bottles
for
export
to
the
u
s
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
smooth
as
newcastle
brown
ale
given
a
choice
id
choose
newcastle
over
this
drinkability
i
imagine
getting
a
good
bottle
is
a
bit
of
a
crapshoot
but
barring
that
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
wouldnt
mind
another
it
seems
a
bit
thin
though
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
the
beer
has
good
flavor
i
just
want
more
of
it
i
dont
want
to
have
to
strain
myself
to
get
a
flavor
profile
if
you
like
light
tasting
dark
beers
give
this
one
a
try
d
this
is
a
quality
brew
something
you
dont
want
to
drink
too
warm
on
cask
i
know
its
a
disaster
as
ive
often
suffered
you
could
still
bump
into
a
decent
wychwood
tiedhouse
somewhere
in
oxfordshire
but
for
people
out
of
that
region
this
bottle
is
decent
enough
just
curious
why
wouldnt
they
consider
using
brown
bottles
to
maintain
a
better
consistency
of
the
quality
of
this
beer
dont
think
i
would
buy
againbut
will
not
have
any
problem
finishing
this
six
pack
other
comments
i
definitely
prefer
the
canned
version
to
the
bottled
one
if
they
used
brown
bottles
it
might
be
a
different
story
havent
found
it
on
cask
yet
though
all
in
all
its
a
nice
easydrinking
brew
overall
a
pretty
standard
ale
doesnt
really
do
anything
wrong
but
it
doesnt
try
to
push
the
envelope
with
whats
possible
either
oelergud
i
actually
find
this
quite
drinkable
i
still
dont
know
if
its
worth
12
99
for
a
six
but
ill
probably
buy
a
single
or
two
every
now
and
then
nice
beer
the
level
of
carbonation
adds
to
the
overall
mouthfeel
for
a
refreshing
taste
of
mother
england
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
beers
ive
had
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
beer
to
seek
out
for
session
drinking
when
you
want
something
with
a
little
more
bitterness
than
the
typical
uk
brew
the
best
thing
hobgoblin
has
going
for
it
is
its
serving
size
of
500ml
for
the
same
price
as
many
other
10
oz
craft
beer
everything
else
is
just
so
so
for
its
style
does
not
possess
anything
special
plain
with
litte
head
or
lacing
no
redeeming
flavors
or
smells
and
a
just
a
tad
better
than
avergae
with
drinkability
though
not
a
session
beer
the
clear
glass
and
lack
of
buyers
at
the
palce
i
gfot
it
may
have
caused
it
to
be
a
bit
skunked
dont
plan
to
get
this
one
again
i
dont
think
this
is
one
ill
have
again
ive
had
one
time
to
move
on
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
w
an
inch
of
head
that
quickly
settled
to
less
than
a
quarter
inch
laced
well
had
to
sniff
really
hard
to
appreciate
any
smell
malty
loved
the
taste
slightly
sweet
w
a
hint
of
hops
finished
chocolatety
with
a
faint
hint
of
licorice
good
mouthfeel
w
a
lot
of
fine
fizzy
carbonation
could
have
easily
thrown
back
quite
a
few
of
these
wait
a
minute
i
did
if
its
on
the
shelf
in
front
of
you
at
the
store
i
wouldnt
be
afraid
to
pick
it
up
later
on
in
my
travels
i
met
up
with
one
who
called
himself
kinjushkeka
one
of
the
rare
and
famed
seers
wise
men
and
eunuchs
from
the
mid
east
when
asked
about
the
quality
of
this
beer
he
replied
only
this
ale
in
clear
bottle
is
no
good
idea
is
easliy
transformed
by
great
alchemist
sunuv
ray
to
black
rodent
with
white
mohawk
and
terrible
ass
perfume
this
brew
glides
its
way
around
the
palate
from
start
to
finish
milky
mouthfeel
and
an
oily
finish
drink
one
today
a
very
poor
brew
apart
form
the
initial
appearance
doesnt
leave
me
eager
to
try
the
breweries
other
products
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
cheers
really
quite
drinkable
just
not
too
exciting
preferable
to
all
macro
lagers
but
not
something
i
plan
on
revisiting
again
anytime
soon
uf
thanks
mark
you
oculd
easily
drink
three
or
four
of
these
in
a
couple
of
hours
but
begins
to
get
heavy
after
a
few
really
fills
you
up
brown
with
some
slight
ruby
hints
aromas
are
of
black
licorice
rose
apple
and
some
soft
fruit
the
flavors
are
fairly
malty
with
some
minor
grassy
hop
notes
and
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
making
a
brief
appearance
however
there
is
very
little
body
to
this
beer
at
all
and
not
much
of
a
finish
to
speak
of
overall
quite
disappointing
pours
a
standard
brown
ale
amber
with
dark
garnet
highlights
a
nice
tan
head
and
some
lacing
smell
is
a
little
offputting
at
first
adjuncty
macro
cornheineken
skunk
fades
into
caramel
malts
taste
sadly
does
the
same
skunky
then
caramel
malts
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
crisp
body
is
a
little
light
overall
the
skunky
heineken
aspect
of
this
beer
kind
of
drowned
out
the
sweet
caramel
malty
tones
that
i
like
in
a
brown
i
cant
help
but
think
those
damn
clear
bottles
that
british
breweries
love
to
use
adds
to
this
unfortunate
characteristic
has
potential
but
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
a
tasty
and
drinkable
ale
this
has
a
nice
strong
flavor
that
isnt
fatiguing
on
the
tongue
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
tan
head
above
the
clear
dark
amber
brew
head
fades
quite
slowly
with
excellent
foamy
lacing
aroma
is
balanced
of
grains
and
hoppiness
taste
is
light
maltiness
upfront
and
as
with
the
nose
well
balances
but
with
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
not
off
but
not
exactly
a
benefit
either
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
average
to
good
but
could
even
be
a
bit
better
if
the
close
was
smoother
nice
brew
nonetheless
which
i
imagine
would
be
even
better
on
handpull
great
lablel
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
tannish
puffy
head
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruitcherries
plums
and
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
fruity
malt
with
little
hops
noted
finish
is
very
light
and
leaves
a
mild
malt
sweetness
in
the
mouth
easy
to
drink
taste
is
initally
a
little
skunky
but
this
fades
immediately
leading
to
a
solid
malt
feel
with
a
toasted
finish
and
dates
in
between
nothing
that
really
spins
my
cap
too
expensive
theres
way
better
local
stuff
for
cheaper
i
like
the
low
levels
of
carbonation
average
enough
drinker
but
i
would
prefer
something
a
bit
more
complex
i
wonder
if
this
one
is
better
if
it
didnt
have
to
make
a
trip
across
the
pond
perhaps
a
road
trip
is
in
order
a
nice
mahogany
maple
syrup
color
a
little
ring
of
foam
is
all
youve
got
for
a
head
for
most
of
the
glass
with
spotty
lacing
smells
malty
and
little
raisiny
taste
is
really
sweet
malty
with
some
prunes
finish
is
a
little
roasted
weak
dead
mouthfeel
nothing
to
see
here
folks
what
a
unpleasent
little
english
beer
nice
label
about
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
it
comes
out
of
a
clear
bottle
and
into
a
imperial
pint
glass
pours
like
water
and
looks
like
a
standard
brown
and
i
got
a
ok
head
of
off
white
fluff
after
the
head
sank
quickly
i
was
smelling
the
beer
and
it
has
a
slight
sulfur
smell
that
distract
from
the
decent
malt
drinking
it
is
somewhat
of
a
challegne
as
it
is
yet
another
slated
british
beer
not
too
bad
like
sammy
smiths
but
i
think
the
sulfur
smell
might
come
from
one
of
these
the
hops
are
pleasently
mild
and
the
malt
was
not
too
malty
and
i
am
quite
sure
there
was
some
adjuct
sugar
used
in
making
this
at
least
this
beer
is
thin
so
i
could
chug
the
rest
dont
bother
with
this
beer
drinkability
overall
it
was
good
but
bland
it
started
out
alright
but
finished
off
rather
lacking
in
character
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
again
especially
considering
the
price
very
drinkable
especially
for
cooler
weather
a
bit
sweet
and
heavy
for
hot
weather
great
label
dont
forget
this
one
for
halloween
this
one
pours
much
darker
than
i
expected
dark
brown
with
coppercolored
accents
there
is
virtually
no
head
retention
at
first
but
a
little
begins
to
appear
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subtle
i
notice
a
faint
nut
smell
alongside
extrasweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
wild
theres
a
lot
more
going
on
in
my
glass
than
i
thought
there
was
the
overwhelmingly
sweet
malt
flavor
is
definitly
in
command
of
this
ship
but
there
are
some
hops
raisins
dried
fruit
and
nuts
and
maybe
hints
of
toffee
and
chocolate
as
well
almost
one
too
many
flavors
crammed
into
a
bottle
interesting
though
im
not
so
sure
all
the
different
tastes
in
this
beer
are
mixing
well
on
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
maybe
more
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
the
intense
flavor
gives
this
beer
a
rough
drinkablility
id
have
a
hard
time
knocking
back
a
whole
lot
of
these
not
bad
by
any
means
just
hard
to
really
put
em
down
rich
dark
ruby
color
and
a
sticky
tan
head
smells
like
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
and
fruit
silky
mouthfeel
malts
are
dominant
up
front
hints
of
toffee
and
fruits
a
little
chocolate
malt
can
be
found
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
hop
bitterness
is
light
but
balances
out
the
maltiness
just
enough
a
dry
slighty
buttery
aftertaste
a
damn
good
brown
ale
well
worth
the
3
50
a
pint
small
light
khaki
colored
head
left
a
decent
smattering
of
lace
transparent
chestnut
colored
beer
with
an
orange
hue
mild
floral
and
hoppy
tea
aroma
flavor
is
mild
and
clean
as
well
pale
malts
and
english
tea
hop
flavor
midway
through
it
becomes
just
barely
bitter
finish
is
pretty
clean
just
a
bit
of
lingering
hops
very
nice
beer
that
became
more
enjoyable
halfway
through
the
first
glass
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
good
brown
ale
that
leaves
the
mouth
clean
with
a
refreshing
taste
and
feel
pours
a
ruby
brown
with
a
tannish
head
that
dwindles
to
lacing
the
clear
bottle
definetely
had
an
effect
on
this
brew
a
nice
roasted
nut
glazed
with
caramel
aroma
hints
of
deep
fruit
plums
and
alcohol
aroma
hints
of
caramel
muffin
the
taste
is
suprisingly
light
hints
of
plum
and
caramelized
nectar
honey
bread
with
sugar
medium
bodied
but
goes
down
and
refreshes
very
refreshing
for
dark
ale
not
as
thick
as
most
while
this
is
not
the
best
brown
i
have
had
its
not
bad
i
can
imagine
this
being
very
nice
straight
from
the
source
the
trip
across
seems
to
have
gotten
to
this
one
its
ok
dog
nothing
stand
out
about
this
beer
nothing
wrong
but
the
smell
an
average
typical
english
brown
drinker
thats
altogether
bland
and
boring
with
meager
but
acceptable
flavors
and
body
to
get
ya
to
finish
the
pint
poured
copper
brown
from
brown
12
oz
bottle
with
unreadable
date
printed
on
neck
aroma
very
unpleasant
saying
horseblanket
would
be
too
kind
redeeming
taste
of
rich
malts
with
faint
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
some
diacetyle
but
correct
for
style
nice
hop
bitternes
in
aftertaste
slick
mouthfeel
i
would
suggest
trying
a
single
bottle
clear
redbrown
nice
carbonation
holds
it
and
laces
well
smells
malty
and
fruity
very
pleasant
has
a
fruity
taste
that
i
really
enjoy
sweet
malty
backbone
slight
alcohol
taste
and
taste
of
maybe
its
dark
cherries
smooth
carbonation
and
goes
down
easy
definately
a
session
beer
i
really
enjoy
this
one
for
everyday
drinking
a
nice
brew
but
there
were
aspects
of
the
smell
that
disappointed
this
is
a
brown
ale
that
is
scared
of
its
own
shadow
its
incredibly
meek
if
it
doesnt
run
and
hide
from
you
in
the
beer
store
theres
not
much
point
in
picking
it
up
ive
stayed
away
from
wychwood
beer
until
now
for
a
host
of
reasons
clear
glass
bottles
foremost
among
them
overpricing
is
another
the
bottles
are
well
done
with
an
attractive
shape
and
embossed
witches
on
broomsticks
as
are
the
colorful
cartoony
tolkeinesque
labels
it
has
always
looked
to
me
however
that
the
brewery
is
trying
too
hard
putting
more
emphasis
on
the
packaging
than
the
beer
now
that
ive
had
my
first
bottle
i
cant
say
that
i
was
that
far
off
the
mark
i
take
back
what
i
said
about
bud
dark
but
i
have
no
desire
to
go
hobnobbin
with
this
hobgoblin
again
thin
watery
light
carbonation
does
not
do
it
for
me
the
taste
is
kind
of
bland
with
no
tingle
of
carbonation
at
all
it
almost
tastes
flat
it
is
kind
of
fruity
the
aftertaste
brings
up
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
also
a
slight
toffee
malty
bitterness
as
well
damn
a
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
style
nevertheless
this
brew
is
a
brown
bodied
brew
big
bubbly
cream
head
results
from
a
nice
cascade
show
lots
of
rising
bubbles
the
scent
is
mainly
sweet
caramel
malt
some
butteryness
to
it
as
well
quite
rich
taste
chocolate
and
sweet
caramel
malts
some
nutty
and
buttery
notes
slight
hop
bitterness
not
a
horrible
brown
but
these
beers
just
dont
do
it
for
me
was
able
to
try
hobgoblin
on
tap
last
evening
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
amber
with
a
nice
sized
offwhite
brown
head
that
broke
down
and
left
a
haze
over
the
brew
leading
to
lacing
through
out
the
aromas
from
this
brew
were
very
malty
with
a
fairly
heavy
concentration
of
caramel
with
a
noticeable
scent
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
is
dominated
by
malt
which
tends
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
can
notice
some
fruit
like
flavors
that
complement
the
brew
nicely
also
can
notice
a
nice
hop
like
taste
at
the
end
of
the
sip
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
one
that
can
be
a
session
type
brew
with
its
nice
taste
and
medium
alcohol
amount
much
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
imo
a
very
enjoyable
beer
taste
is
reminding
me
a
of
strong
nutty
brown
ale
i
like
the
sweet
and
chewy
malt
presence
here
buttery
caramel
smoothness
with
a
noticable
hop
snap
the
ale
poured
a
thick
opaque
reddish
brown
with
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
was
light
but
smelled
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
was
very
appealing
it
was
truly
sweet
malt
with
a
great
cherry
finish
and
a
strong
alcohol
burn
throughout
its
feel
was
thick
and
syrupy
almost
medicinal
i
normally
avoid
beers
with
the
most
fanciful
names
so
i
found
myself
in
the
intermezza
cafe
in
atlanta
and
the
selections
lacked
a
little
umph
this
ones
promise
of
chocolate
malt
fet
my
thoughts
and
so
it
was
ordered
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
it
was
quite
a
treat
clear
500
ml
bottle
with
best
before
date
stamped
on
the
rear
label
overall
a
most
enjoyable
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
clear
dark
chestnut
body
reveals
glimmering
highlights
of
orange
beneath
a
short
but
creamy
head
of
ivory
colored
foam
the
head
retention
is
fairly
good
and
it
holds
well
before
dropping
to
a
standard
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
that
leaves
minor
spotty
lace
about
the
pint
the
nose
reveals
dark
fruit
plumprune
red
graperaisin
a
smear
of
buttery
diacetyl
an
edge
of
ironlike
minerals
and
a
dusting
of
dark
chocolate
its
smooth
and
light
across
the
palate
with
a
delicate
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
the
flavor
is
not
as
rich
as
the
nose
might
suggest
but
its
lightly
vinous
fruit
appears
first
on
the
palate
followed
by
some
light
notes
of
toffee
and
some
mild
diacetyl
and
leafy
hop
in
the
finish
its
quite
well
balanced
and
the
bitterness
simply
balances
what
notparticularilysweet
malt
is
there
its
interesting
and
has
enough
character
and
drinkability
to
make
it
a
decent
session
ale
sweet
malts
toffe
and
chocolate
seemed
to
dominate
the
taste
profile
fruitiness
came
out
as
well
as
the
beer
warmed
hops
were
subtle
a
decent
enough
beer
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
youngs
fullers
or
even
some
sam
smith
beers
that
we
get
here
in
the
states
not
a
bad
brew
but
rather
hohum
the
dryness
did
make
it
fairly
drinkable
pours
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
malitness
with
grainy
nunances
a
suprising
lack
of
taste
here
i
get
some
sweetness
with
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
like
watered
down
club
soda
and
i
could
drink
few
but
not
overly
impressed
i
like
the
goblin
on
the
bottle
though
clear
bottle
pours
faintly
cloudy
nice
toasted
almond
color
nutty
malty
nose
leaves
well
dispersed
lacing
malty
british
brown
ale
lots
of
malt
evident
moderate
sweetness
balance
is
the
british
way
and
this
one
is
a
nice
example
nicely
rounded
mouthfeel
smooth
finish
fine
sessioner
good
drinking
this
is
something
i
buy
every
year
especially
around
halloween
maybe
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
i
wasnt
expecting
so
much
alas
maybe
this
should
be
a
lesson
to
me
to
not
overhype
beers
to
others
and
let
them
judge
for
themselves
for
they
may
experience
the
same
thing
i
did
with
this
selection
everything
about
this
brew
is
truly
fantastic
i
seem
to
think
so
anyway
smashing
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
mahogany
color
that
had
ruby
red
highlights
on
the
edges
and
seemed
to
be
well
carbonated
after
a
normal
pour
a
beigecream
colored
head
was
formed
light
cloud
like
texture
not
very
dense
lasted
some
time
but
not
overly
long
then
it
falls
to
a
light
ring
on
the
edges
there
was
some
lace
present
mostly
in
presented
in
creamy
sheet
form
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
chocolates
caramels
dark
malts
roasted
nut
fall
leafs
and
some
earth
tones
the
tastes
were
much
like
the
aromas
it
started
off
with
a
dry
leaf
landing
on
the
tongue
followed
by
roasted
nuts
and
malts
a
sweet
caramel
taste
comes
in
and
leaves
just
as
fast
light
bitter
chocolates
through
out
earth
notestones
as
it
heads
to
the
back
of
the
throat
then
gets
nutty
as
it
leaves
the
aftertaste
was
mostly
malty
the
overall
impression
of
the
taste
was
it
started
off
on
the
dry
side
then
slid
into
a
watery
feel
the
rest
of
the
way
the
body
was
on
the
light
to
lightmedium
side
this
is
a
simple
beer
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
bottles
look
like
theyve
changed
mine
was
brown
not
clear
like
the
picture
on
this
page
beer
was
a
nice
rich
amber
red

relatively
clear
not

much

just
the
right
amount
of
hoppiness
for
me
less
than

sierra

pale

very
bubbly
in

theres
a
quite
strong
sweet

aftertaste
i
like
this
taste
though
i
think
its
something
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
overall
id
recommend
this
as
definitely
worth
a
try
with
the

enough
sweetness
without

i
smell
a
little
chocolate
but
it
is
not
predominant
i
can
smell
the
salinity
of
the
water
in
this
beer
as
well
sea
salt
taste
is
woodtoned
alcohol
at
first
for
me
which
i
found
odd
subsequent
sips
reveal
definite
butter
some
light
cinnamon
bbqlike
spiciness
at
the
back
along
with
the
roasted
sourness
of
the
sweet

malt
the
yeast
makes
itself
known
in
the
fruity
ester
and
vanilla
richness
excellent
balance
with
the
hops
in
the
finish
adding
just
enough
dryness
to
balance
the
malt
with
sweetness
edging
out
bitterness
just
by
a
margin
floral
grassiness
as
the
aftertaste
creamy
with
carbonation
at
a
minimum
very
drinkable
on
an
autumn
day
or
a
cold
winter
night
or
even
in
the
summer
and
i
imagine
it
would
pair
well
with
indian
food
still
a
decent

a

biscuity

as

awesome

on
this
full
of
sugary
malt
and
treacle
absolutly
fantastic
hops
are
in
there
but
leave
the
malt
to
dominate
this
beer
which
in
my
mind
works
wonders
ive
had
this
on
tap
as
well
and
id
say
go
for
the
bottle
an
average
beer
all
around
hoppy

this
is
good
stuff
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
it
tastes
a
bit
bitter
at
first
but
then
that
coffeechocolate
flavor
kicks
in
with
a
little
spice
the
aftertaste
is
wonderful
and
rich
its
actually
better
as
you
get
towards
the
bottom
maybe
because
its
better
when
its
not
too
cold
i
would
rate
it
as
my
top
3
a
tasty
treat
for
any
beer
lover
bit
of
coffeechocolate
in
the
taste
with
just
a
trace
of
hop
in
the
finish
it
is
smooth
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
nothing
to
make
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
crowd
but
not
a
bad
brew
pours
a
pretty
deep
rubyamber
color
that
is
topped
by
a
creamy
light
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
predominantly
malty
with
a
deep
fruitiness
reminiscent
of
raisins
and
cherries
perhaps
a
bit
of
cough
syrup
as
well
quite
light
on
the
palate
up
front
which
moves
to
a
soft
malty
sweetness
and
the
same
type
of
fruitiness
as
in
the
nose
actually
this
is
pretty
nice
it
is
easy
drinking
and
is
driven
by
the
light
maltiness
and
the
aleyeast
derived
fruitiness
definitely
a
good
session
beer
dark
amber
with
a
good
head
almost
looked
like
it
was
nitrous
poured
dark
caramel
apple
peels
and
wood
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
nice
flavor
but
it
was
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
thin
and
light
side
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
tap
though
ive
heard
some
horror
stories
about
the
wychwood
clear
bottles
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
short
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
and
bubbly
lace
lots
of
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
along
with
notes
of
chicory
moderate
in
bodya
bit
thin
towards
the
finish
taste
begins
with
semisweet
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
molasses
followed
by
some
flavors
of
bitter
dayold
coffee
and
a
trace
amount
of
spicy
hops
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
special
very
tasty
brew
indeed
love
the
flavor
profile
and
creamy
body
easily
consumed
in
mass
quantities
i
think
i
could
do
some
damage
to
this
funky
little
beer
hobgoblins
beware
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
ever
had
an
array
of
different
flavors
ranging
from
floral
to
sweet
to
smooth
earthy
textures
to
dark
chocolate
flavors
beautiful
auburn
colour
and
a
dense
rich
head
i
honestly
cannot
say
enought
about
this
amazing
brew
highly
recommended
wish
it
was
more
available
and
not
quite
expensive
nonetheless
its
worth
it
a
lighter
more
consumable
ale
all
in
all
a
let
down
imo
and
not
one
i
will
return
to
get
it
fresh
or
in
a
bottle
thats
never
seen
sunlight
and
i
think
this
would
be
rather
good
different
although
i
did
see
some
of
their
other
offerings
in
clear
vessels
at
the
same
store
curious
drinkability
is
extremely
high
great
balance
and
flavor
an
absolutely
superb
english
ale
its
tasty
enough
but
not
somethign
i
will
seek
out
again
the
balance
of
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
is
too
far
towards
the
sweet
end
for
me
if
it
fermented
a
bit
dryer
i
think
i
would
like
it
alot
better
this
is
something
i
buy
every
so
often
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
honestly
one
12
oz
bottle
was
enough
for
me
500
ml
bottle
pours
with
a
dark
brown
colour
low
head
aroma
of
malts
and

either
the
gift
pack
my
wife
got
for
me
had
two
bottles
and
a
pint
glass
i
thought
the
gift
pack
was
pretty
cool
but
its
not
a
beer
ill
run
out
and
look
for
again
the
beer
becomes
a
very
enchanting
clear
deep
chestnut
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
its
capped
by
a
large
creamy
perforated
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
chocolate
caramel
and
toasted
malt
can
be
found
in
the
bouquet
there
is
a
definite
sweetness
to
it
although
mild
light
flowery
hops
are
hiding
behind
that
although
become
sharp
on
occassion
the
flavour
really
comes
out
once
it
warms
up
a
honey
sweetness
with
toasted
malt
in
the
middle
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
and
a
return
of
the
sweetness
to
accompany
the
hops
on
the
aftertaste
there
is
an
astringent
character
that
lingers
on
after
everything
else
fades
away
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
it
rolls
over
smooth
until
the
aftertaste
becomes
sticky
and
herbal
this
ale
runs
the
gamut
from
sweet
to
astringent
and
is
not
shy
about
it
my
lasting
impression
after
finishing
the
pint
has
all
of
that
sweet
malt
forgotten
and
has
me
feeling
like
ive
been
chewing
on
dandelion
leaves
all
afternoon
only
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
for
me
and
perhaps
once
every
blue
moon
as
well
came
in
another
wychwood
trendoid
clear
glass
artsy
labeled
extravaganza
clear
bottle
thankfully
it
was
not
skunked
poured
a
crystal
clear
brownamber
with
a
smallish
off
white
cap
which
reduces
to
a
nice
surface
covering
lace
aromas
are
fairly
pronouncedroasted
caramel
malts
grassy
hops
some
spice
notes
and
a
slight
mustiness
nice
nose
to
this
brew
starts
with
a
large
buttery
mellow
malt
bodygreat
burnt
toffee
tastes
that
give
way
to
a
wonderful
licorice
taste
as
the
hops
kick
infinish
drops
off
rather
quickly
with
the
lingering
licorice
taste
that
hangs
in
as
an
after
taste
a
nice
brown
alei
love
how
they
got
the
licorice
effect
with
the
hopmalt
balance
but
over
priced
and
with
the
clear
bottle
there
is
a
chance
of
getting
a
skunked
bottle
its
a
deep
brownishred
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
very
low
carbonation
nice
malty
aroma
chocolate
subtle
hops
caramel
hints
of
fruit
in
the
first
sips
then
the
beer
turns
to
a
nutty
mildly
malty
taste
its
a
smooth
creamy
and
has
a
very
soft
restrained
finishbalanced
with
english
hops
its
extraordinarily
drinkable
i
could
have
countless
of
these
still
id
be
leery
of
the
bottle
ive
had
mixed
results
with
this
brewery
and
lightstruck
beer
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
for
mass
consumption
but
this
is
much
better
than
i

interesting

oved
this
beer
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
an
unfiltered
bottle
but
sense
then
they
have
changed
hands
and
our
now
more
easily
found
but
i
have
to
say
this
beer
lacked
something
it
was
thin
and
tinny
with
an
undesirable
off
character
maybe
a
bad
keg
but
the
bottles
ive
had
recently
were
disappointing
as
well
a
quick
pick
when
nothing
looked
exciting
and
the
graphics
caught
my
eyes
figuring
that
it
was
just
a
gimmick
brew
just
to
note
this
beer
had
been
skunked
but
was
not
horrible
poured
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
head
that
dissipated
after
a
few
minutes
smell
was
slightly
skunk
but
you
could
make
out
a
faint
smell
of
sweet
malt
tasted
sweet
with
little
hop
to
it
mouthful
was
decent
sad
part
is
this
beer
was
in
a
brown
bottle
and
purchased
in
a
store
that
has
a
very
high
turnover
had
been
distinctly
light
struck
i
would
drink
again
insuring
storage
was
better
on
the
part
of
the
importer
and
distributor
as
this
beer
would
be
infinitely
better
had
it
not
been
mishandled
im
not
going
in
to
detail
about
aroma
flavors
and
what
not
as
i
dont
have
one
in
front
of
me
ill
just
say
it
was
not
by
any
means
an
offensive
beer
however
id
never
buy
it
again
unless
the
only
other
things
to
choose
from
where
the
big
three
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
seems
a
bit
skunky
but
i
can
detect
a
hint
of
roasted
barley
and
victory
malt
the
taste
is
good
but
not
great
the
beer
just
does
nothing
for
me
sure
i
can
drink
it
but
where
is
the
complexity
they
have
these
really
cool
labels
but
the
beer
just
isnt
as
good
when
will
the
european
breweries
quit
with
the
clear
glass
bottles
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
is
a
good
sessions
ale
this
one
poured
a
light
brown
color
and
had
chunks
of
yeast
in
it
the
head
was
an
offwhite
color
and
faded
abruptly
the
nose
was
kind
of
skunky
and
a
little
sweet
caramel
the
taste
was
very
bready
up
front
it
also
had
a
buttery
slickness
to
it
hops
were
very
strong
in
the
finish

very
unspectacular

a

the
taste

starts
off
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
to
a
dry
hop
finish
the
finish
is
a
bit
sour
but
not
a
nasty
spoiled
sour
there
are
slight
hints
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
decent
mouth
feel
dirnkability
is
average
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
buy
again

unless
it
was
on
draft
on
tap
at
eli
cannons
in
middletown
ct
i
was
excited
to
see
this
so
i
could
actually
try
an
unskunked
version
of
hobgoblin
clear
bottles
anyways
the
beer
flowed
out
of
the
tap
looking
amber
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
settled
into
a
thin
haze
over
the
beer

plenty
of
fruitiness
particularly
pear
and
perhaps
a
little

but
that
might
have
just
been
from
the
dryness
of
the

wrong
i
first
encountered
this
ale
when
i
went
to
the
great
british
beer
festival
in
2000
however
i
have
to
say
i
do
not
remember
to
much
of
that
tasting
since
i
consumed
more
then
my
share
of
ales
that
day
i
have
since
had
a
bottle
at
my
favorite
drinking
establisment
and
enjoyed
it
it
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
the
better
tasting
brown
ales
that
i
had
in
northern
england
i
did
not
notice
a
strong
nose
to
it
but
it
did
a
full
malt
flavor
that
i
do
like
there
was
that
very
english
bitter
flavor
to
it
but
that
did
not
last
on
the
whole
i
would
recomend
this
beer
for
some
one
that
wants
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
not
heavy
this
came
in
a
500ml
bottle
with
a
picture
of
the
creature
it
was
named
after
on
the
front
honestly
the
picture
is
what
first
drew
me
to
this
in
the
cooler
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
very
nice
head
with
good
retention
aroma
was
similar
to
a
brown
ale
newcastle
to
be
exact
and
had
the
soft
nose
characteristics
of
other
english
ales
the
taste
begins
as
almost
pure
hop
bitterness
however
it
quickly
takes
on
a
malty
fruitfilled
character
and
finishes
off
with
a
balance
between
the
two
the
way
the
flavors
changes
multiple
times
and
with
such
contrast
all
in
one
sip
is
something
i
find
unique
about
this
ale
while
it
isnt
something
i
would
buy
again
its
worth
a
try
and
would
likely
be
favorable
to
anyone
that
enjoys
this
particular
style
thanks
for
reading
asides
from
the
cool
axe
weilding
label
the
only
thing
going
for
this
beer
is
the
colour
and
the
smell
i
got
a
fresh
bottle
so
skunkiness
was
nonexistent
as
it
was
for
some
reviewers
beautiful
dark
amber
glow
i
fell
in
love
with
aroma
was
sweet
enough
to
be
pleasant
but
not
so
sweet
that
it
smells
like
a
calorie
stuffed
dessert
that
was
all
i
enjoyed
from
this
beer
it
tasted
bland
id
give
it
a
lower
taste
score
but
after
a
few
sips
i
guzzled
it
then
guzzled
it
tastes
okay
but
not
enough
to
save
it
mouthfeel
was
sticky
chewy
and
dry
drinkability
no
way
will
i
ever
be
drinking
this
beer
again
which
sucks
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
dont
know
why
but
really
i
did
oh
well
dark
clear
garnetcolored
body
with
just
a
bit
of
apparent
co2
not
much
of
a
head
and
that
fades
pretty
quickly
though
a
fine
lace
stays
atop
the
beer
nearly
until
the
end
malty
chocolate
aroma
with
spicy
floral
hops
hints
of
fruit
present
as
well
rather
hoppy
flavor
spicy
and
somewhat
fruity
with
a
smooth
malt
backing
chocolate
flavor
is
subdued
but
comes
through
strong
in
the
finish
where
it
blends
with
a
rich
fruity
flavor
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
but
somewhat
saved
by
an
oily
hop
finish
very
interesting
ale
id
purchase
again
if
it
didnt
come
in

a
dark

are

taste
coffee
flavouring
is
not
so
apparent
in
the
smell
but
is
definitely
noticeable
in
the
flavour
a
very
smooth
ale
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
as
i
had
a
friend
who
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
i
can
now
say
the
same
a
good
english
brown
hobgoblin
lives
up
to
its
name
its
a
little
known
beer
that
causes
a
great
uproar
in
your
mouth
it
has
a
nice
golden
brown
color
to
it
and
has
a
golden
taste
the
taste
is
somewhat
remeniscentsp
of
a
chocolate
malty
flavor
mixed
with
fruit
which
is
deep
and
strong
it
has
a
good
head
to
it
and
ofcourse
isnt
carbonated
and
comes
off
fresh
give
it
a
try
and
youll
be
suprised
pours
a
nice
brown
hue
with
a
whitetan
head
possibly
a
little
bit
light
stuck
due
to
a
slight
skunkiness
in
the
smell
a
good
english
brown
ale
nothing
that
knocks
my
socks
off
a
very
cool
bottle
however
points
for
a
cool
label
and
name
very
pretty
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
light
skunk
aroma
buried
the
malt
and
caramel
that
should
have
been
more
within
reach
luckily
my
bottle
wasnt
lightstruck
long
enough
for
the
flavor
to
be
affected
as
well
even
so
the
flavor
was
a
little
unbalanced
on
the
butterymalty
side
there
was
a
slight
nutty
and
hoppy
flavor
but
not
enough
in
my
opinion
this
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
get
it
again
nice
color
poured
well
the
head
held
nicely
but
it
wasnt
the
ale
taste
that
i
expected
not
hoppy
at
all
it
was
a
very
hot
day
and
it
did
hit
the
spot
but
for
the
price
and
the
availability
of
other
brews
id
choose
something
else
the
next
time
good
attention
getter

maltychocalate

some

flavor
in

smell
was
a

the
appearance

taste
was
real
nice
it
pours
with
a
2cm
head
that
dissipates
to
a
persistent
thin
layer
of
tan
foam
the
colour
is
amazing
a
beautiful
deep
dark
coppery
red
the
taste
is
smooth
with
some
bitterness
and
also
a
nice
sweet
leading
edge
certainly
something
i
would
drink
again
lol
as
with
previous
post
i
have
to
agree
this
beer
has
a
very
bad
scent
or
should
i
say
smell
to
it
not
impressed
with
the
color
either
was
very
opaque
the
taste
saved
it
somewhat
while
it
didnt
have
near
enough
hops
for
me
my
friend
said
it
was
very
bitter
i
will
drink
this
brew
agian
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
cheers
as
with
wychwoods
fiddlers
elbow
i
got
a
big
noseful
of
skunk
probably
because
of
the
clear
bottle
its
got
a
decent
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
hops
a
slight
amount
of
chocolate
comes
through
it
seems
a
bit
thin
one
of
the
smellliest
beers
ive
ever
had
kind
of
had
a
rotten
smell
which
didnt
really
make
me
want
to
drink
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
ok
quite
malty
and
bitter
hop
finish
just
a
bit
strange
oh
yeah
lose
the
clear
bottles
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
solid
tan
head
on
the
nose
there
are
aromas
slight
hops
and
a
pinch
of
chocolate
could
be
detected
after
reading
the
description
on
the
back
label
on
the
palate
hops
nutty
slight
caramel
and
rounds
out
with
some
fruitiness
mouth
feel
is
smooth
overall
good
stuff
but
a
bit
high
in
price
16
9oz
bottle
rich
ruby
colored
brew
impressive
appearance
nice
bubbly
cascading
effect
when
poured
lumpy
head
reduces
to
a
persistent
layer
of
tan
foam
sweet
wort
caramel
and
hoppy
aroma
slick
and
full
on
the
palate
chocolate
malt
is
evident
as
well
as
molasses
with
an
orangey
hoppy
flavor
in
the
finish
id
love
to
try
this
cask
conditioned
notes
a
tasty
rounded
and
full
bodied
brown
ale
first
off
love
the
label
and
bottle
design
wychwood
certainly
has
some
colorful
labels
hobgoblin
has
great
deep
brown
color
with
very
little
head
taste
was
really
good
most
dark
beers
taste
heavy
but
not
this
one
murky
dark
amber
with
a
slight
lace
initially
fruity
nose
gets
lost
in
a
sea
of
malts
toasted
hazelnut
malt
body
finishes
with
a
hint
of
hop
and
fruityester
creamymellow
form
makes
this
brown
a
drinker
a
really
nice
malty
brown
ale
a
slightly
buttery
flavor
combined
with
a
smooth
chocolate
taste
made
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
not
worth
me
drinking
really
and
i
do
not
think
it
will
d
complex
and
at
the
same
time
not
really
easy
to
drink
t
very
nice
subtle
and
easy
going
a
simple
and
enjoyable
beer
d
easy
to
down
and
a
pretty
good
choice
for
people
into
fully
natural
beer
i
didnt
mind
this
but
wasnt
blown
away
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
the
aromas
very
subdued
picking
up
faint
hints
of
grain
and
floral
hops
caramel
malt
becomes
more
apparent
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
the
flavour
is
predominantly
caramelbiscuity
malt
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
from
the
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
alot
crisper
and
less
creamy
than
i
expected
but
is
altogether
quite
enjoyable
drink
the
beer
could
be
promising
with
a
few
adjustments
it
lacks
severely
in
the
flavour
department
ive
seen
this
on
the
lcbo
shelves
for
a
bit
now
and
finally
decided
to
pick
one
up
as
it
sounded
interesting
pours
a
golden
colour
that
starts
with
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
of
faint
floral
hops
with
some
earthiness
to
it
taste
has
a
very
mild
bitterness
much
less
than
expected
little
bit
of
hops
and
bread
in
the
flavour
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
it
is
in
ontario
when
you
can
get
fullers
for
cheaper
mellow
slightly
hoppy
flavor
with
good
character
and
depth
nicely
balanced
malts
well
crafted
a
good
session
beer
to
kick
back
on
an
afternoon
of
cricket
or
football
overall
a
decent
attempt
but
boring
ultimately
it
does
nothing
to
endear
itself
d
very
drinkably
makes
a
good
pint
for
a
warm
day
after
work
drinkability
simple
subtle
but
easy
to
drink
its
a
satisfactory
beer
to
wile
away
the
time
with
so
about
as
much
as
anything
rolling
out
of
wychwood
aspires
to
be
tastes
similar
to
the
nose
hops
are
a
little
more
pronounced
caramel
and
buttered
toast
i
think
thats
what
it
is
nothing
to
really
keep
coming
back
to
in
my
opinion
pours
a
tan
to
orange
color
with
modest
head
and
a
bit
of
haze
nose
has
some
black
tea
herbal
components
with
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
on
the
palate
the
tea
flavor
returns
with
some
apple
cidery
flavors
and
a
modest
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
creamy
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
and
rather
easy
drinking
this
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
american
palate
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
more
than
one
would
be
out
of
the
question
i
have
many
more
belgians
lying
in
wait
to
satisfy
my
need
for
sour
picked
up
a
500
ml
bottle
at
lcbo
cool
barley
and
hop
art
illustrated
on
the
bottle
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
funky
aging
cheese
smell
with
a
metallic
twinge
pours
to
a
gold
colour
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
the
head
is
off
white
and
fades
quickly
taste
is
quite
basic
good
malt
backbone
bitterness
starts
slow
then
builds
into
a
dull
bitter
aftertaste
no
big
hop
bite
actually
quite
balanced
i
was
expecting
more
kind
of
disappointed
not
a
brew
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
basic
by
all
means
on
the
second
pour
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
improved
dramatically
it
is
on
target
for
the
style
but
in
my
opinion
still
just
an
average
brew
not
an
offensive
brew
fairly
easy
drinking
just
a
bit
dull
very
drinkable
all
things
considered
with
enough
interest
to
keep
me
titillated
its
not
a
beer
that
is
going
to
cause
me
apoplexy
or
fanaticism
but
its
smooth
easydrinking
and
inoffensive
d
drinks
pretty
easily
as
youd
expect
for
a
bitter
poured
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
brilliant
bronze
with
aminimal
white
headnice
rich
clarity
big
fruity
malts
in

along
with
some

toastiness
is
in
there
as
well
if
you
life

english
esbs
this
is
for
youfruity
as
all
get
outgreen
apple
mainly
with
a
tinge
of
vanilla
and
caramela
passing
leafy
hop
comes
in
late
its
bigtime
quaffable
and
subtlelike
it
should
be
the
bottles
i
have
are
not
esb
certainly
a
fine
epa
but
i
dont
get
the
attributes
of
previous
posters
but
i
do
get
a
fair
ale
regardless
not
bad
your
highness
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
little
head
and
there
is
very
little
head
retention
this
beer
has
a
pronounced
caramel
flavor
with
some
very
faint
sweetness
underneath
it
tastes
mainly
of
caramel
with
very
little
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
i
could
see
this
being
a
pretty
good
session
beer
overall
this
one
leaves
me
wanting
of
another
to
validate
the
experienceenjoyable
and
yet
so
swiftly
gone
was
the
beer
that
good
or
that
ignorable
i
will
admit
my
sense
of
tast
has
been
eluding
me
lately
so
in
all
fairness
this
one
might
need
another
review
after
a
trip
to
the
doctors
honestly
for
now
i
can
say
thatim
in
a
better
place
having
drained
it
d
quite
good
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
only
pleasant
that
it
is
organic
as
well
overall
quite
enjoyable
beer
d
highly
drinkable
due
to
character
and
flavor
and
the
5
makes
this
sessionable
enough
for
a
few
imperial
pints
libation
very
smooth
clean
and
drinkable
the
flavor
profile
is
not
as
complex
as
id
like
but
its
quite
good
for
the
style
id
be
interested
in
trying
the
other
duchy
organics
if
not
necessarily
this
one
again
its
very
sessionable
and
i
guess
the
organic
aspect
is
good
also
t
it
has
a
thick
alcohol
taste
to
it
its
carbonated
malty
actually
very
malty
rich
beer
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
good
balance
of
flavours
i
feel
more
british
with
every
sip
d
overall
a
solid
brew
its
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
i
can
picture
drinking
one
or
two
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
other
nice
characteristics
a
topnotch
example
of
the
style
thats
very
sessionable
and
most
interesting
plus
its
organic
promotes
sustainability
and
profits
a
worthy
cause
to
boot
its
brewed
for
hrh
the
prince
of
waless
duchy
originals
duchyoriginals
com
with
profits
donated
to
hrhs
charitable
foundations
made
with
organic
barley
including
some
from
the
home
farm
at
highgrove
princeofwales
gov
ukthe
country
home
of
hrh
the
taste
was
fairly
bland
fizzy
middry
the
malts
and
hops
are
there
but
neither
grabs
the
beer
by
the
neck
and
sorts
it
out
the
5
0
abv
doesnt
feature
or
show
in
any
way
the
body
suffers
because
of
that
it
seemed
watery
and
lacking
in
the
creamy
rich
stakes
drinkable
but
a
mild
disappointment
good
beer
overall
personally
not
impressed
with
the
whole
organic
thing
since
the
whole
organic
thing
is
not
that
impressive
since
that
i
am
not
that
impressed
with
oh
never
mind
i
believe
this
beer
was
much
more
stout
than
i
was
looking
for
but
i
truely
can
say
that
do
not
hold
out
too
much
for
this
as
you
would
a
fat
tire
in
oklahoma
for
some
reason
i
didnt
find
this
as
drinkable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
good
to
see
it
gone
and
im
not
sure
why
perhaps
its
simply
that
while
its
better
than
most
bitters
its
still
not
that
interesting
ive
always
found
this
style
to
be
one
of
the
best
for
the
cask
format
and
one
of
the
worst
for
the
bottled
in
the
glass
the
beer
seems
stripped
of
all
vitality
without
the
added
depth
that
cask
conditioning
brings
a
lot
of
american
examples
make
up
for
this
by
deviating
from
the
style
and
increasing
the
hopping
but
the
english
stay
true
to
the
template
and
the
beer
suffers
accordingly
as
for
drinkability
good
i
wouldnt
pound
back
a
bunch
of
them
but
id
have
a
few
if
offered
the
opportunity
a
smooth
clean
bitter
mild
all
around
but
thats
what
its
all
about
worth
revisiting
again
although
not
overwhelmingly
memorable
d
a
great
bitter
any
time
of
dayyear
excellently
priced
if
you
live
in
ontario
as
well
a
decent
esb
overall
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
in
comparison
to
other
organic
ales
i
have
tried
however
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
desb
is
a
style
i
really
like
when
done
well
duchy
originals
is
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
it
the
hop
variety
not
sure
which
ones
seem
somewhat
out
of
place
here
still
an
enjoyable
brew
and
worth
a
shot
a
perfectly
decent
bitter
and
suitable
for
vegetarians
unlike
most
beer
which
contains
meat
maybe
its
just
my
antimonarchist
views
and
dislike
for
charlies
architectural
meddling
and
even
worse
his
new
age
nonsense
but
we
really
should
not
be
buying
this
its
okay
to
shoplift
it
though
pours
a
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
tan
head
smell
is
of
ripe
fruit
a
hint
of
sourness
and
an
english
yeast
strain
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
a
grape
like
middle
and
a
earthy
bitterness
a
touch
of
sourness
and
saltyness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
levels
appropriate
to
the
style
drinkability
is
very
good
a
good
example
of
an
english
ale
though
there
are
better
examples
out
there
this
one
is
worth
trying
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
think
is
a
bit
closer
to
an
english
pale
ale
whatever
it
is
it
isnt
great
but
its
worth
a
shot
for
an
organic
beer
mouthfeel
good
body
and
moderatelow
carbonation
as
it
should
have
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
drinkable
although
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
the
appearance
as
i
poured
this
one
was
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
dissolved
quickly
it
had
a
faint
scent
of
sugary
bread
like
an
old
cake
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
good
ale
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
happen
to
come
across
it
this
is
ok
not
awesome
not
horrible
ok
drinks
easily
enough
nothing
ill
seek
out
actively
but
i
dont
mind
it
too
terribly
much
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
to
be
sure
but
its
hard
to
make
a
strong
case
against
it
the
fact
that
its
organic
doesnt
really
matter
much
to
me
but
what
this
beer
lacks
in
overall
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
mouthfeel
and
in
its
bitter
dry
finish
this
is
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
nothing
really
to
get
too
excited
about
smooth
mouthfeel
and
flavours
worth
savouring
make
this
a
pretty
drinkable
bitter
sessionable
at
5abv
d
a
pretty
average
english
ale
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
there
is
nothing
to
complain
about
here
it
is
a
bit
dull
but
that
is
really
par
for
the
style
this
ale
is
typical
of
its
style
everything
that
should
be
there
is
there
a
solid
choice
this
beer
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favourites
i
am
not
particularly
drawn
to
organic
but
this
beer
has
caused
me
to
seek
out
others
that
are
similar
this
pours
nice
with
and
produces
a
1
inch
head
settling
into
slight
fine
foam
i
liked
that
it
wasnt
clear
giving
it
a
little
rustic
look
the
hops
were
exceptional
with
a
leaning
towards
another
favourite
kentish
ale
served
at
41
degrees
f
the
second
tasted
better
then
the
first
a
very
satisfying
beer
that
will
earn
further
fans
nice
bitter
got
this
bottle
at
sams
in
chicago
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
poured
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
settled
down
to
a
partial
thin
cover
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
nice
medium
honey
amber
aroma
is
tropical
fruits
at
first
then
a
little
hoppy
malty
and
burnt
sugar
flavors
very
similar
but
more
dominant
burnt
sugar
and
hops
good
carbonation
and
mouth
nice
bittersweet
finish
session
beer
doesnt
quite
pull
the
entire
package
together
as
well
as
some
esbs
still
worth
a
try
medium
darkbrown
in
color
similar
to
cloudy
iced
tea
with
a
tan
head
somewhat
smoky
aroma
along
with
some
yeasty
background
and
a
small
amount
of
fruit
the
taste
was
boozier
than
i
expected
given
the
style
and
the
abv
and
the
alcohol
covered
up
most
of
the
flavor
some
malt
managed
to
sneak
through
but
not
enough
flavor
of
any
kind
managed
to
survive
there
are
better
british
ales
available
in
the
u
s
d
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
either
drink
nice
and
quickly
or
let
it
sit
and
let
it
open
itself
up
not
too
complex
but
everything
comes
together
very
well
i
could
definitely
drink
another
of
these
and
at
5
its
certainly
not
going
to
affect
me
too
adversely
nice
light
summer
beer
nothing
too
complex
going
on
dr
it
doesnt
have
an
outstanding
or
unusual
flavortaste
but
its
very
good
and
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
drink
this
often
overallthis
is
something
i
could
see
having
on
the
golf
course
on
a
nice
spring
afternoon
light
enough
to
drink
while
being
active
yet
interesting
enough
to
remember
the
fact
that
its
organic
uses
barely
grown
on
the
prince
of
wales
home
farm
and
goes
to
charity
makes
it
a
keeper
in
my
book
pours

colored

very

tasting
d
easy
drinker
nicely
balanced
ale
high
marks
for
drinkability
i
could
definitely
handle
this
one
as
a
session
beer
on
a
warm
day
wish
i
had
another
bottle
have
to
say
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
i
was
quite
disappointed
to
finish
it
as
it
was
my
only
one
d
this
is
a
session
brew
of
the
highest
order
i
can
imagine
sitting
in
an
old
woody
pub
and
sipping
a
few
pints
on
a
rainy
day
maybe
with
a
plowmans
plate
loaded
with
stilton
and
some
buttered
crumbly
bread
good
stuff
future
outlook
this
was
ok
and
completely
unoffensive
but
there
are
too
many
much
better
choices

drinkability
an
interesting
beer
glad
i
was
given
the
opportunity
to
try
it
fairly
solid
though
a
little
heavy
on
the
fruity
esters
for
my
tastes
is
that
just
an
unavoidable
english
thing
nice
that
its
organic
too
and
the
alcohol
is
both
manageable
and
well
hidden
so
its
solidly
drinkable
dull
hazy
copper
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
some
toastycaramel
maltiness
with
green
apple
tartness
hay
and
earthyfloral
hops
are
hanging
out
in
the
background
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
muted
biscuity
malts
with
a
lemongrass
twang
and
a
lingering
earthy
bitterness
medium
in
body
without
much
carbonation
so
it
is
rather
smooth
going
down
and
finishes
long
and
dry
smooth
mild
and
refreshing
but
lacking
a
bit
in
flavor
overall
a
very
well
crafted
and
balanced
ale
a
fair
amount
of
depth
and
it
certainly
opens
up
the
more
it
warms
all
organic
and
the
profits
are
donated
to
charity
so
that
is
certainly
something
as
well
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
will
definitely
be
getting
this
somewhat
regularly
to
savor
and
enjoy
i
do
wish
it
was
available
in
6packs
instead
of
only
singles
check
it
out
d
pros
and
cons
but
nonetheless
a
tasty
very
clean
beer
with
a
non
offensive
profile
i
bet
the
prince
drinks
this
out
of
the
bottle
when
he
scoops
up
some
bitches
and
goes
sailing
nice
dark
gold
almost
brown
colour
with
a
tight
head
the
nose
is
fairly
malty
with
some
hops
in
the
background
nice
to
see
the
use
of
organic
elements
in
this
beer
this
is
malt
forward
drinking
ale
with
some
complexity
let
it
warm
up
and
enjoy
with
food
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
makes
you
want
another
bottle
nice
beer
nice
carbonation
but
a
strong
alcohol
character
and
a
noticeable
aftertaste
on
this
one
regardless
a
good
beer
and
worth
buying
again
all
done
right
the
drink
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
slightly
astringent
finish
reminiscent
of
strong
black
tea
the
beer
features
very
good
drinkability
and
is
a
particularly
excellent
pairing
with
a
link
of
spicy
pork
sausage
on
wheat
bread
with
yellow
mustard
tasted
on
61808
quite
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
on
what
has
become
a
warm
and
sunny
evening
d
this
is
an
uneven
beer
it
has
its
good
qualities
but
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
it
could
be
better
500ml
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
in
toronto
pours
an
attractive
slightly
clouded
dark
copper
very
little
head
mild
typical
english
pale
ale
aroma
the
flavour
is
also
rather
typically
english
and
decent
mild
hoppiness
well
balanced
low
carbonation
d
drinkabibily
is
good
nice
dry
flowery
hop
makes
for
a
good
english
ale
that
is
good
in
multiples
the
taste
is
a
solid
bitter
flavour
bittersweet
with
beautiful
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
great
balance
clean
crisp
it
tastes
of
toast
with
pine
hints
of
toffee
earth
nuts
and
fruit
d
great
beer
for
session
drinking
a
nice
representation
my
only
gripe
is
the
aftertaste
nice
standard
sessionable
esb
flavor
is
a
little
bit
bland
with
a
hard
mineral
character
and
lots
of
sticky
sweet
malts
hops
are
assertive
but
somewhat
unclear
in
particular
flavor
the
pleasant
floral
notes
from
the
nose
arent
there
while
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
thick
and
chewy
the
flavor
doesnt
raise
this
one
much
above
average
a
decent
session
ale
a
very
nice
representation
of
they
style
and
also
nice
to
see
a
beer
that
is
both
organic
and
whose
sale
contributes
to
charity
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
good
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
some
lacing
looks
true
to
style
smells
earthy
slightly
coppery
quite
rounded
and
with
somenice
soft
hops
intermingling
with
the
firm
light
malt
taste
is
similar
very
well
integrated
and
balanced
and
with
more
of
the
typical
metallic
earthiness
soft
hops
and
roundedness
mouthfeel
is
soft
but
with
a
subtle
bite
at
the
eend
very
drinkable
and
quite
nice
indeed
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
organic
two
other
great
things
going
for
this
beer

organic
2

drink
up
d
decent
overall
it
was
a
little
disappointed
w
the
organic
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
although
always
a
good
idea
to
support
organic
dont
know
much
about
english
ales
but
this
is
rather
bland
and
i
think
it
needs
a
bit
more
punch
wether
it
be
alcohol
or
hops
from
a
1
pint
09
fl
oz
bottle
copped
in
morris
county
nj
this
organic
english
ale
pours
an
apricotcolored
hue
with
minimal
head
smell
is
of
fresh
hops
and
flowers
with
a
crisp
clear
inviting
taste
that
is
both
refreshing
and
appealing
the
clear
and
natural
organic
taste
is
certainly
present
as
this
beer
goes
down
as
smooth
as
water
without
a
trace
of
sedatives
or
bitterness
can
definitely
see
this
as
a
good
session
brew
although
its
superior
quality
certainly
warrants
respect
a
good
represenation
of
the
style
worthy
of
recognition
and
definitely
worth
a
try
good
flavor
crisp
refreshing
satisfying
and
wholeseome
recommended
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
in
it
that
stands
out
as
one
to
get
again
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
but
there
are
plenty
out
there
that
i
would
take
above
it
including
from
the
same
brewery
pours
a
small
head
and
a
very
murky
copper
color
somewhat
sweet
smelling
with
hints
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
the
exceptionally
bitter
hop
flavor
hits
you
at
the
back
of
the
throat
i
certainly
like
that
sensation
but
i
dont
taste
very
many
other
flavors
at
all
only
after
the
beer
starts
to
warm
a
bit
do
i
start
to
taste
hints
of
malt
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
a
bit
reminiscent
of
a
carbonated
cola
i
suppose
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
i
expect
more
from
an
esb
and
i
wish
there
were
something
to
attract
me
besides
the
admittedly
attractive
fact
that
its
organic
d
not
at
the
top
of
my
esb
list
but
would
definitely
drink
again
if
offered
pours
a
caramel
color
with
a
slight
red
tone
to
it
smell
has
a
barley
tone
to
it
with
a
mild
sweet
edge
to
it
taste
is
somewhat
interesting
with
a
pronounced
barley
flavor
to
it
it
has
a
frothy
mouth
to
it
that
feels
good
you
could
drink
a
lot
in
a
sitting
and
it
is
worth
trying
but
i
have
to
say
i
doubt
this
is
the
finest
example
of
the
style
drinkability
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
to
be
honest
some
have
hated
it
for
its
awkward
mineral
and
medicinal
flavors
while
i
cant
say
i
truly
enjoyed
them
i
did
appreciate
the
direction
the
beer
was
heading
and
tip
my
hat
to
the
brewers
creativity
pours
a
dark
shade
of
copper
and
a
small
beige
cap
of
large
bubbles
looks
thickish
aromas
of
honey
sweetness
slight
caramel
light
florals
and
some
slight
funk
on
the
horse
blanket
side
a
distinct
perfumy
herbal
note
catches
you
midway
and
initially
is
hard
to
shake
loose
but
soon
becomes
very
enjoyable
toasted
grains
toffee
notes
at
a
nice
level
and
balanced
well
with
some
mild
hops
that
has
delicate
notes
of
pepper
tea
herbals
florals
and
a
faint
pine
finishes
pretty
mildly
with
a
slight
twang
woodsy
smooth
mouthfeel
for
a
light
body
an
easy
drinker
and
seemingly
parable
to
a
variety
of
foods
i
appreciate
the
subtlety
given
to
this
its
nice
to
have
something
thats
not
punching
me
in
the
grill
with
every
sip
pours
a
mild
amber
color
with
a
smallish
head
aroma
is
mainly
just
malt
somewhat
fruity
i
cant
detect
much
else
taste
is
strong
and
bitter
upfront
but
fades
into
a
fruitymalty
aftertaste
that
lingers
i
dont
detect
paint
thinner
like
one
reviewer
though
just
tastes
average
for
the
style
a
decent
esb
that
gets
the
job
done
if
nothing
else
not
a
bad
organic
ale
from
england
and
the
proceeds
go
to
charity
i
guess
so
thats
a
good
thing
md
softlycarbonated
medbodied
juicelike
on
the
texture
all
befit
a
fresh
cask
ale
all
in
all
the
performance
is
better
than
the
bottled
version
and
quite
delicious
as
a
cross
bw
pale
ale
and
best
bitter
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
better
esbs
that
i
have
had
i
like
the
balance
and
though
the
water
has
a
significant
amount
of
minerals
it
doesnt
rake
across
your
palate
like
chalk
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
drinkability
its
not
horrible
overall
impression
very
delicate
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
about
9
pints
of
this
beer
well
brewed
with
the
second
pour
im
getting
a
slight
haze
and
the
flavours
are
still
holding
my
interest

balanced
by

with
the

balancing
the
bit
of
tannic

just
a
hint
of
apricot
mild
bitterness

states
that
the

foundation
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
thought
this
was
one
the
better
examples
of
an
esb
or
bitter
that
ive
had
to

highly
recommend
trying

and

some

a

the
taste
much
like
the

is
dominated
by
the
malt
with
some
faint
metallic
notes
running
in
the
background
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
as
i
would
probably
get
bored
with
it
pretty
quickly
definately
worth
a
try

a

pretty
quick
minimal

nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
decently
refreshing
not
bad
at
all
nothing
to
write
home
about
fairly
forgettable
beer
i
dont
know
why
this
has
received
such
negative
ratings
as
i
rather
enjoyed
it
it
poured
a
red
copper
colour
with
a
twofinger
sand
coloured
head
that
died
down
to
a
frosty
blanket
in
a
few
seconds
smell
was
both
sweet
malt
and
nice
earthy
hops
the
sweet
malts
had
a
warm
toasted
grain
smell
to
them
with
a
bit
of
english
toffee
almost
reminding
me
of
an
english
barleywine
almost
the
taste
was
rather
sweet
as
well
at
first
then
turning
pleasantly
bitter
i
rather
enjoyed
this
ale
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
actually
based
on
other
reviews
i
would
likely
buy
this
again
oelergud
organic
certification
is
a
very
good
thing
but
youre
still
wasting
resources
and
doing
the
environment
a
disservice
brewing
a
beer
that
isnt
worth
buying
while
the
contents
of
my
glass
are
worth
finishing
and
helping
charity
and
mother
earth
are
both
worthy
causes
i
cant
see
donating
my
liver
or
money
to
this
beer
again
this
is
ok
nothing
spectacular
it
could
use
a
cleaner
malt
profile
and
heftier
hops
a
nice
session
beer
and
probably
the
best
of
the
spring
release
that
ive
had
so
far
overall
i
like
it
and
ill
drink
it
again
it
would
go
well
with
something
like
a
deli
sandwich
slightly
hoppy
nose
but
not
a
big
aroma
drinks
well
big
dose
of
hops
a
touch
of
fruitiness
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
begging
to
be
paired
with
a
good
lunch
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
solid
beer
i
dont
know
that
being
organic
makes
any
difference
though
generous

shade
of

update
i
caught
a

more
malt
in
this
2009
vintage
its
a
nice
drinkable
ale
that
is
still
hell
to
look
at
d
the
solid

of
this
restrained
brew
make
for
one
that
will
satisfy
without
sating
for
a
dangerously
long
time
the
price
and
my
own
stock
of
homebrew
is
what
keeps
this
from
becoming
a
standard
house
brew
pours
a
small
head
and
a
very
murky
copper
color
somewhat
sweet
smelling
with
hints
of
caramel
and

the
exceptionally

besides
the
admittedly
attractive
fact
that
its
organic
amber
hue
with
a
small

with
good
lacing
and
retention
for
a
beer
im
so
fond
of
the
smell
comes
as
little
of
a
let
down
when
reviewing
it
with
some
sherbety
citrus
hops
but
the
taste
is
beautifully
balanced
hops
and
caramelbiscuit
malt
not
particularly
strong
flavours
but
great
easy
everyday
drinking
i
can
ask
for
little
more
from
the
lovely
fine
carbonation
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
great
summer
bitter
ill
have
another
please
your
royal
highness
murky
copper
body
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
malt
and
enlish
hops
tastes
malty
with
a
fair
bit
of
hops
rather
wellballanced
flavor
is
not
overpowering
medium
bodied
rather
tasty
imo
a
solid
ale
definitely
see
myself
getting
this
one
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
crisp
and
clean
not
terribly
complex
but
very
satisfying
not
even
a
hint
of
off
flavors
an
organic
beer
that
is
head
and
shoulders
above
other
organics
ive
tried
my
girlfriend
picked
this
one
out
for
me
on
the
basis
that
it
was
organic
figured
id
give
it
a
go
pours
golden
copper
with
a
slight
head
that
goes
away
fairly
quickly
hardly
any
smell
to
this
beer
maybe
its
me
but
it
just
kind
of
smells
like
beer
taste
is
fairly
smooth
pretty
well
balanced
with
some
slight
fruit
notes
coming
through
in
the
end
decent
enough
beer
something
id
certainly
try
again
but
not
something
that
is
the
object
of
fantasies
nice
the
beer
pours
a
palerthanexpected
straw
to
light
copper
color
with
a
light
haze
very
nice
carbonation
retention
and
lacing
smells
quite
fruity
and
not
as
malty
caramelly
as
anticipated
a
bold
hop
aroma
gives
off
earthy
and
grassy
notes
tastes
malty
with
pilsnertype
malts
and
never
shows
brittish
pale
malt
caramel
toasty
flavors
shows
nearly
tart
apple
and
appricot
flavors
follows
up
with
ripe
oranges
and
lemons
much
more
fruity
than
i
expected
a
strong
grassy
hop
flavor
ties
it
all
together
from
sip
to
finish
otherwise
a
beer
with
segmented
flavors
that
needs
melding
clean
and
crisp
in
the
finish
with
a
light
lingering
citrus
and
hop
note
this
is
one
of
those
ales
for
which
it
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
if
you
detest
ringwood
yeast
as
some
do
then
do
not
buy
this
ale
you
will
be
very
angry
if
you
like
ringwood
yeast
then
you
will
probably
love
this
great
package
classy
label
rich
amber
copper
color
crisp
foamy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
good
long
while
not
much
to
the
nose
a
touch
of
florals
a
bit
of
citric
acid
surpreme
maltiness
hoppiness
finishes
the
sip
with
a
dryness
that
brings
it
all
together
you
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
great
beer
pours
a
brilliant
amber
in
color
with
a
tan
head
of
impressive
duration
and
excellent
lacing
nose
is
subtle
but
inviting
and
combined
with
the
first
sip
is
reminiscent
of
the
british
mild
style
definitely
a
mild
maltforward
brew
with
a
hint
of
subtle
aromatic
and
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
even
delicate
and
perfect
for
the
style
restrained
bitterness
along
with
a
very
subtle
yeast
tang
ala
a
nut
brown
highlight
the
flavor
profile
bitterness
although
slight
lingers
very
nicely
this
brew
is
all
about
balance
and
is
one
of
the
most
immediately
impressive
organic
brews
one
that
i
would
buy
and
recommend
to
others
time
and
time
again
a
very
very
good
brew
perfect
for
sessioning
average
beer
being
organic
makes
it
slightly
above
very
refreshing
beer
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
bleh
i
dont
like
the
pin
prick
carbonation
here
it
feels
like
mineral
water
this
overwhelms
the
rather
subtle
but
pleasant
herbal
flavour
which
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
suggest
this
beer
is
largely
ruined
by
the
carbonation
and
at
10
of
the
total
score
my
rating
will
inevitably
fail
to
recognise
the
magnitude
of
this
weakness
its
very
flavorful
as
a
whole
reminds
me
of
a
gently
spiked
caramel
apple
but
it
does
have
its
flaws
the
appearance
could
be
better
more
of
a
head
especially
and
it
could
use
a
fuller
body
still
in
all
a
good
brew
that
i
buy
on
occassion
because
its
something
different
from
england
and
has
a
nice
unique
taste
a
round
ale
that
goes
down
easily
while
it
may
not
be
complex
it
is
easily
quaffed
i
am
reminded
of
samuel
smiths
pale
ale
on
this
one
sample
at
alefest
dayton
this
beer
is
a
pale
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
thin
spotty
lacing
bready
malt
aroma
mediumbodied
with
earthy
slightly
stale
malt
flavor
along
with
some
caramel
the
finish
is
malty
and
metallic
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
not
very
enjoyable
mmmmm
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
delicious
brew
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
so
well
balanced
this
beer
would
be
great
on
cask
500ml
brown

with

unintelligible

transparent

with
insignificant

and
light

medium

in
the

nice
toasted

biscuit
malt
flavors
with
gentle
drying
mineral
water
and
hop
finish
body
balances
carbonation
with
medium
creaminess
not
at
all
complex
but
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
as
a
session
beer
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
wychwood
i
have
a
tendency
to
slant
my
gazes
in
beer
stores
toward
the
american
and
belgian
brews
but
its
nice
to
grab
a
good
esb
like
this
periodically
duchy
originals
organic
english
ale
pours
almost
the
same
color
brown
as
the
bottle
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
one
pint
and
nine
tenths
ounces
bottle
malt
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
good
malthop
balance
but
the
finish
is
less
than
great
being
a
bit
metallic
not
bad
not
exciting
either
just
kind
of
average
worth
a
try
picked
up
from
beers
of
the
world
in
rochester
this
brew
has
a
classy
label
and
a
nice
appearance
its
a
slightly
amber
tawny
color
very
clear
with
a
shallow
dullwhite
head
fairly
low
carbonation
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
fruit
and
roasted
malts
toast
and
bread
crust
caramel
apple
and
dried
fruits
its
a
little
rustic
and
subdued
but
very
pleasing
the
taste
is
dry
with
a
slant
toward
malt
flavor
in
the
foretaste
significant
bittering
and
a
resiny
hop
flavor
takes
over
by
the
finish
which
has
a
lingering
bitterness
a
dry
and
estery
brew
with
a
moderate
malt
taste
and
a
considerable
hop
finish
not
a
bad
beer
its
restrained
and
well
put
together
it
doesnt
grab
you
from
the
onset
but
i
found
it
enjoyable
notes
a
balanced
brew
that
ends
up
being
on
the
malty
side
not
one
ill
hunt
down
by
any
stretch
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
light
bit
hazy
good
combo
of
sweet
and
bitter
flavor
light
and
airy
carbonation
in
the
mouth
nicely
balanced
smooth
and
easy
drinker
label
boasts
that
it
exclusively
uses
organic
barley
which
is
great
but
i
didnt
notice
anything
in
the
flavor
different
from
others
in
this
style
nearly
medium
bodied
when
enjoyed
at
room
temp
and
maybe
a
bit
over
bittered
but
i
aint
complaining
this
is
a
fine
if
a
bit
pricey
session
beer
i
think
profits
go
to
help
poor
english
kids
learn
to
play
polo
this
is
was
a
big
let
down
considering
it
was
a
beerofthemonth
pick
at
plump
jacks
home
of
the
best
beer
selection
in
sf
aftertaste
was
full
and
bitter
so
i
had
to
swallow
each
sip
a
couple
of
times
very
good
example
of
the
style
16
9
ounce
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
slightly
bitterfruity
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
malty
flavor
that
is
easily
drinkable
it
goes
down
with
ease
and
finishes
with
some
light
hops
and
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
it
has
a
nice
english
ale
yeast
fruitiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
light
and
easily
drinkable
with
a
decent
malthop
character
had
this
at
a
beer
and
cheese
tasting
it
was
matched
with
quickes
goat
cheddar
devon
virtually
zero
head
some
hop
aroma
but
mostly
faint
malt
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
it
did
have
a
nice
fresh
taste
to
it
though
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
mouthfeel
is
destinctively
thin
and
lacking
body
this
lack
of
body
intesifies
the
dry
hoppy
character
i
had
quite
some
expectations
on
this
brew
as
duchy
originals
claims
to
offer
uncompromisingly
good
food
but
one
again
as
with
their
biscuits
i
must
admit
to
be
rather
disappointed
someone
earlier
on
described
this
as
a
piss
now
i
wouldnt
go
that
far
it
definitely
is
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
label
it
as
enjoyable
too
watery
too
sweety
sweety
as
in
marshmallows
or
cheap
toffees
well
sure
not
up
to
its
ambition
as
the
profits
of
the
sales
of
this
brew
go
to
prince
charles
charitable
foundation
it
would
have
been
great
if
they
could
have
found
a
better
brewer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
comprised
of
floral
european
hops
with
a
bit
of
a
biscuit
thing
the
flavor
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
solid
esb
nice
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
nothing
spectacular
but
solid
everything
one
would
expect
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
stodgy
and
stiff
with
straightforard
esbish
hopping
and
basic
caramel
malt
flavors
nothing
to
excess
in
any
direction
if
one
is
looking
for
what
i
would
think
a
classic
baseline
esb
then
this
would
pretty
much
be
it
im
sure
that
on
cask
or
less
well
traveled
this
beer
would
be
quite
good
but
as
it
is
it
is
a
bit
better
than
average
an
almost
horrible
example
of
an
esb
extremely
light
bodied
lack
of
malt
flavors
unbalanced
astringent
a
striking
hoppy
aroma
immediately
comes
through
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
but
this
is
not
followed
by
any
malt
whatsoever
taste
is
like
a
bad
overhopped
lager
no
complexity
bland
thin
not
good
and
will
definitely
not
buy
this
again
the
bottle
looked
nice
thats
about
it
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
tight
head
that
falls
to
just
under
a
finger
over
the
beer
clarity
is
good
and
bubbles
release
from
the
bottom
every
few
seconds
nose
is
pretty
subtle
i
get
solid
toasty
british
malt
base
with
a
light
earthy
hop
and
very
slight
fruity
character
smells
nice
flavor
is
okay
the
same
characteristics
from
the
nose
are
here
but
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
character
first
to
hit
is
an
incredible
toasty
malt
character
lightly
grainy
but
very
tasty
this
is
followed
by
crisp
and
clean
bittering
from
noble
hops
the
finish
is
a
nice
combination
of
toastyness
and
very
light
bitter
the
metallic
taste
from
the
first
sip
is
not
carrying
through
in
the
rest
of
the
beer
enjoyable
feel
is
moderate
with
very
light
carbonation
keeps
drinking
very
easy
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
bitters
i
have
had
off
a
handpull
but
from
a
bottle
id
have
this
one
again
a
nice
bitter
pour
out
an
amber
with
a
flat
white
headskie
flavor
is
mild
bit
of
a
biscuit
chew
in
the
malt
hops
are
not
but
front
but
add
the
bitter
balanceing
mouthfeel
is
average
not
super
smooth
at
all
i
was
very
excited
to
see
a
new
organic
beer
choice
as
i
try
to
limit
my
entire
diet
to
only
organic
sources
but
alas
this
brew
does
not
deliver
it
aint
bad
but
it
is
just
a
very
simple
ale
i
suppose
it
doesnt
have
any
lofty
claims
so
i
cant
fault
them
for
that
but
its
just
not
special
in
any
way
meh
not
bad
as
a
black
tan
with
some
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
the
ale
poued
a
clear
amber
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
floral
hops
it
was
very
light
and
nothing
else
really
came
thourgh
the
taste
though
had
a
start
of
light
malt
with
just
a
tad
of
vanilla
then
a
nice
light
hop
finish
the
feel
was
medium
and
oily
yet
it
had
a
pleasantly
dry
finish
this
is
a
delicate
session
beer
it
had
very
distinct
yet
subtle
features
an
enjoyable
beer
one
thinks
that
this
is
bloody
awful
no
wonder
prince
charles
drinks
timothy
taylors
landlord
delicately
balanced
and
teetering
on
falling
away
from
flavor
this
is
a
massively
drinkable
pint
that
could
easily
take
you
through
many
toasts
in
a
night
at
the
local
im
not
surprised
that
duchy
originals
original
english
ale
not
a
very
poetic
name
now
is
it
is
brewed
by
wychwood
it
has
their
okay
but
little
better
than
average
fingerprints
all
over
it
oh
well
at
least
a
portion
of
my
3
49
went
to
the
prince
of
waless
charitable
foundation
itd
be
nice
if
a
little
something
went
to
the
brewerys
rd
department
as
well
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
i
did
enjoy
but
it
could
use
a
fuller
flavor
and
body
in
my
opinion
the
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
became
a
little
distracting
by
the
time
i
finished
the
bottle
im
not
so
sure
that
this
beer
is
different
from
the
brewerys
original
organic
ale
i
think
that
they
just
slapped
the
word
english
on
the
label
as
added
evidence
for
this
argument
this
is
definitely
a
bitter
like
their
original
organic
ale
and
not
a
brown
this
has
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
low
to
medium
white
head
the
smell
is
mainly
of
brown
sugar
and
malts
with
a
slight
tang
from
the
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
with
well
rounded
malty
flavors
light
hops
and
even
subtle
yeast
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
and
certainly
refreshing
this
is
perhaps
a
bit
light
but
tasty
none
the
less
not
a
bad
ale
nothin
spectacular
but
solid
all
round
almost
like
a
poor
mans
fullers
1845
with
less
alcohol
flavour
and
class
mouthfeel
medium
body
fine
carbonation
crisp
a
bit
astringent
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
denmark
amber
colour
moderate
head
lovely
hoppy
aroma
hints
of
heather
tobacco
and
spices
flavour
is
nutty
and
biscuity
a
hint
of
toffee
but
not
really
sweet
good
bitterness
which
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
very
nice
savoury
barley
flavour
quite
sticky
mouthfeel
even
a
little
bit
cloying
some
grainyness
with
some
resiny
hops
in
the
finish
shares
a
lot
of
same
characters
as
other
beers
from
wychwood
a
bit
unexciting
and
pretty
boring
in
the
end
im
glad
i
didnt
have
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
served
via
nitro
pour
ontap
this
esb
is
fine
looking
but
otherwise
unexceptional
body
is
smooth
but
too
thin
extremely
colorful
beer
and
has
full
flavor
had
nitro
tapped
a
good
esb
and
quite
smooth
compared
to
others
hazy
amber
color
with
a
think
head
most
likely
due
to
the
nitro
tapping
very
full
bodied
and
surprisingly
not
so
bitter
a
higher
abv
is
always
appreciated
but
the
smoothness
from
this
esb
made
it
very
drinkable
perhaps
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
is
the
execution
of
the
style
overall
a
refreshing
change
from
run
of
the
mill
esbs
had
it
on
nitro
at
the
brewery
fresh
smooth
an
extra
tasty
extra
special
bitter
much
like
fillers
esb
with
slightly
richer
caramel
tones
great
head
and
lightly
carbonated
like
all
good
english
rand
should
be
next
to
no
flavor
or
smell
for
me
has
an
awesome
look
to
and
super
smooth
flavor
with
great
drinkability
the
nitro
really
does
this
beer
good
as
i
dont
think
it
would
be
as
good
without
it
would
get
this
again
if
i
saw
it
had
on
draft
nitro
at
the
brewery
nice
looking
nitro
head
nice
rich
color
very
little
smell
maybe
a
bit
musty
great
creamy
nitro
mouthfeel
but
very
little
taste
admittedly
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
so
my
rating
is
really
just
for
my
personal
remembrance
of
what
i
thought
of
the
beer
i
am
sure
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
or
at
least
better
than
my
rating
suggests
on
nitro
at
the
brewery
pours
dark
copper
with
a
creamy
white
head
light
malt
and
spice
aroma
smooth
with
low
carbonation
malty
mostly
with
ever
so
slight
hops
lingering
malt
flavor
and
a
clean
finish
not
much
going
on
here
and
i
am
not
really
a
fan
very
boring
and
not
much
flavor
i
feel
like
the
nitro
takes
away
from
a
beer
like
this
making
it
more
bland
than
it
otherwise
would
be
on
nitro
at
pingleheads
dark
coloured
tasty
stuff
the
hops
and
of
course
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
survived
fine
on
nitro
a
little
creamy
fun
stuff
that
still
hit
the
spot
after
a
long
day
and
night
and
day
of
drinking
beer
i
could
drink
this
for
two
days
i
dont
usually
like
esbs
so
it
took
als
recommendation
for
me
to
order
this
surprisingly
balanced
as
the
malted
barley
meets
earthy
yeast
and
tangy
fruit
creamy
as
hell
thanks
to
the
nitro
i
enjoyed
this
but
gimme
my
pour
of
huna
back
im
not
a
big
fan
of
english
style
bitters
but
this
was
a
great
beer
as
one
poster
commented
and
i
agree
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
my
general
complaint
with
esbs
are
they
tend
to
be
on
the
bland
side
and
lacking
in
flavour
no
worries
here
this
beer
delivers
some
very
very
intense
flavors
starts
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavormouthfeel
and
finishes
with
a
nice
very
bitter
hop
bite
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
i
will
look
for
it
again
it
is
available
only
on
tap
o
this
is
a
very
flavorful
esb
that
is
also
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
exceeded
expectations
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
brew
othe
best
esb
i
have
had
so
far
grant
it
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
flavorful
and
an
easy
drinker
highly
recommended
overall
an
interesting
and
easy
drinking
beer
o
usually
ccs
session
beers
are
unimpressive
to
me
but
minaret
hits
the
mark
probably
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
nice
esb
but
not
my
favorite
cc
offering
admittedly
esb
isnt
my
favorite
style
not
bad
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
head
into
my
ccb
snifter
caramel
malts
with
a
great
balance
of
bitter
hops
on
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
intensified
this
is
a
well
crafted
easy
drinking
session
able
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
o
nice
well
balanced
brew
here
that
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
enjoyed
this
one
well
worth
a
try
very
nice
beer
im
pretty
sure
this
was
my
first
esb
a
nice
style
i
will
be
exploring
a
little
more
o
solid
beer
im
impressed
to
find
a
gem
like
this
in
the
heart
of
florida
buy
it
if
you
find
it
and
you
like
esbs
i
had
this
at
the
kickbacks
cigar
cityst
somewhere
dinner
im
reviewing
this
by
memory
on
this
i
had
this
at
the
kickbacks
cigar
cityst
somewhere
dinner
i
have
had
most
of
ccs
regular
beers
but
i
have
not
tried
this
yet
toasty
flavors
as
style
suggests
with
some
nice
american
citrus
hop
flavors
worth
trying
but
not
there
best
want
to
try
again
overall
good
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
had
while
i
havent
had
a
ton
i
know
this
one
is
good
worth
trying
pours
a
lovely
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
white
head
nice
aromas
of
roasted
caramel
malt
and
bitter
orange
peel
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
nicely
lots
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
bitter
citrus
hops
that
linger
on
the
palate
for
some
time
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
pleasant
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
bitter
and
exceptionally
drinkable
0
was
very
pleased
like
how
the
bitterness
did
not
ruin
the
fruitiness
of
the
beer
overall
decent
example
of
a
true
english
esb
dryness
is
too
much
however
o
this
is
the
first
weak
beer
ive
tried
from
cigar
city
its
not
bad
but
compared
to
the
other
offerings
its
lacking
some
character
unless
you
are
fan
of
the
style
pass
this
one
out
and
try
their
other
choices
d
not
bad
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
taste
and
the
bitterness
is
slightly
soapy
still
a
much
more
authentic
bitter
than
one
usually
finds
at
an
american
brewery
warming
with
a
dry
finish
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
mediumlight
effervescence
some
oak
notes
in
the
aftertaste
are
nicely
cleansing
without
removing
all
remnants
of
flavor
a
decently
balanced
flavorful
brew
that
holds
fairly
true
to
my
recollection
of
the
style
not
overly
hoppy
but
it
is
the
lead
guitar
in
the
band
o
sure
the
style
of
this
one
doesnt
exactly
appeal
to
the
masses
but
it
was
still
tasty
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
nice
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
retention
mild
lacing
aroma
amazingly
reminds
me
of
topps
brand
bubble
gum
like
the
kind
that
was
in
baseball
card
packs
from
25
years
ago
maybe
even
the
specific
smell
of
the
gum
combining
with
the
cardboard
from
the
cards
talk
about
memory
lane
taste
is
mildly
bitter
no
alcohol
noted
mild
sweetness
nice
balance
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
nice
light
hop
profile
was
highlighted
by
hints
of
grapefruit
and
fresh
grass
as
it
warmed
it
got
tremendously
more
balanced
with
a
light
bready
malt
character
coming
through
and
a
light
herbal
like
quality
to
it
smooth
flavor
here
though
the
hops
did
seem
a
touch
off
to
me
light
with
a
grapefruit
peach
lemon
like
tartness
coming
through
in
the
front
and
an
almost
green
tea
leave
like
flavor
in
the
mid
palate
intresting
mix
of
flavors
here
some
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
light
grain
coming
through
now
smooth
mellow
and
consistent
carbonation
never
failed
and
allowd
this
very
sessionable
lager
to
really
be
a
smooth
and
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
a
fine
esb
and
another
of
the
recent
approachable
normal
beers

it
poured

the

is

it
almost
has
some
coffee
notes
as
well
sour
and
bitter

o
i
think
couldve
better
the
metal
characteristics
in

are
the
beers
downfall
it
had
the
potential
to
be
good
just
fell
short
skal
a
colossal
esb
as
hoppy
as
any
ipa
but
still
very
much
done
in
the
english
tradition

a

around

super
fair
here
an
aroma
of
grassy
bittering
hops
in
aggressive
proportion
and
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
my
nostrils
as
i
sniff
malt
is
big
too
some
probably
60
crystal
as
well
as
some
maris
otter
or
the
like
its
bready
and
fat
i
the
middle
and
a
higher
gravity
english
ale
yeast
dries
it
up
pretty
good
the
hops
are
center
stage
throughout
though
and
the
balance
that
the
style
usually
demonstrates
is
ignored
thats
okay
through
the
magnum
is
a
fun
varietal
not
often
used
in
such
hefty
doses
and
i
think
the
result
is
good
rock
art
has
evolved
nicely
over
the
years
and
this
extreme
series
is
all
worth
checking
out
love
the
hoppy
vermont
stuff
and
rock
art
deserves
more
attention
for
its
hoppy
beers
top
quality
appears
a
clear
bright

with
bright
white

that

smells
earthy

and
oxidized

is
biscuity

medium

moderate

overall
a

disappointing
in
the
flavors
sorry
rock
art
but
i
wont
be
buying
anything
from
you
anytime
soon
i
almost
wonder
why
this
beer
made
the
list
some
might
like
this
style
but
i
aint
one
of
them
i
used
aint
twice
in
this
blog
post
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
name
might
be
the
longest
beer
name
out
there
the
nose
and
flavorsaftertaste
very
much
remind
me
of
gigantic
ipa
from
oregon
but
this
is
a
vermont
product
and
a
decent
one
at
that
a
good
value
and
worth
a
try
bottom
line
its
not
worth
the
money
more
hype
than
anything
else
here

d
not
quite
up
there
with
vermonster
but
an
excellent
rock
art
offering
that
i
always
try
and
grab
when
im
in
the
area
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
really
bold
flavored
and
hop
forward
esb
not
like
any
other
ive
had
it
was
well
done
and
had
a
good
layering
of
flavors
with
a
sweet
bitterness
on
the
end
good
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
not
your
typical
esb
this
one
poured
out
with
a
nice
deep
orange
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
definitely
dry
hopped
and
gives
off
plenty
of
floral
hop
aromas
in
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
nice
but
again
not
a
traditional
esb
flavor
big
amounts
of
bitter
flavors
dominate
the
maltiness
of
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
texture
with
a
sharp
crisp
finish
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
if
youre
expecting
a
true
esb
style
beer
look
elsewhere
because
this
one
is
more
like
an
ipa
overall
it
is
what
i
expected
from
an
esb
i
enjoyed
this
brew
from
begining
to
end
i
would
buy
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
o
the
saying
on
the
bottle
says
it
all
this
aint
for
no
mamas
boy
or
daddys
girl
this
is
my
first
rock
art
and
i
am
a
bit
impressed
by
the
complexity
of
this
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
good
to
experience
at
least
once
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
one
inch
white
with
some
floaties
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
pear
pine
hard
candy
and
some
grass
taste
is
better
a
good
amount
of
grapefruit
in
the
finish
some
carmel
in
the
beginning
to
go
with
the
flavors
detected
in
the
nose
body
medium
large
plenty
of
life
not
dry
and
for
a
hop
lover
very
drinkable
not
really
sure
what
style
this
reminds
me
most
of
but
a
nice
somewhat
different
beer
tastes
like
copius
amounts
of
pale
malt
extract
nose
is
the
same
very
litter
carbonation
borderlining
on
none
body
is
big
up
front
but
thundering
out
big
time
on
the
swallow
earthy
english
hops
provide
some
fleeting
bitterness
but
theres
no
malt
sweetness
to
balance
it
just
malt
blandness
seriously
tastes
like
unfermented
home
brew
probably
not
finishing
this
bottle
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
getting
mostly
good
beer
from
these
guys
but
this
and
infusco
are
gross
really
enjoyed
this
brew
though
great
take
on
an
esb
definitely
extreme
as
the
label
promises
dial
up
some
english
malt
flavor
and
youve
got
a
serious
winner
here
overall
very
decent
brew
interesting
to
think
about
and
goodtasting
i
will
try
to
braise
a
little
bottom
round
roast
and
create
a
beef
carbonade
with
it
maybe
add
some
root
veggies
and
wild
mushrooms
into
the
mix
o
although
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
rock
art
check
out
my
other
reviews
i
just
dont
think
the
esb
style
especially
this
hypedup
interpretation
is
pleasing
to
my
palate
however
i
encourage
fans
of
esbs
to
give
this
one
a
try
and
rate
it
for
yourselves
you
just
might
find
something
wonderful
in
this
brew
however
i
will
stick
with
other
offerings
from
rock
art
d
a
very
well
done
job
of
pushing
the
envelope
you
can
definitely
see
the
ipa
comparisons
with
the
significant
hop
punch
however
i
feel
that
this
one
demonstrates
the
style
differences
quite
well
an
ipa
this
size
would
be
more
flabby
more
lip
coating
sugar
tack
more
sweetness
more
caramel
and
hopefully
with
a
more
forward
hop
nose
esb2
is
still
robust
but
more
taut
and
less
decadent
is
this
an
esb
i
dont
know
the
hoppiness
is
right
in
your
face
it
is
however
a
very
good
beer
first
of
all
its
not
esb3
its
esb2
second
of
all
this
may
be
the
best
of
the
best
in
bottled
vt
bombers
nothing
mcneils
produces
can
touch
the
flavor
this
beer
leaves
on
the
palate
anything
from
long
trail
magic
hat
wolavers
otter
creek
simply
dont
compare
and
should
all
bow
to
this
absolute
monster
all
in
all
a
great
beer
and
vastly
overlooked
hill
farmstead
not
included
as
they
dont
really
bottle
yet
this
extreme
beer
is
well
made
and
highly
drinkable
and
is
a
fine
example
of
an
esb
be
it
amped
up
that
is
i
wonder
how
this
would
be
on
cask
picked
this
and
few
other
rock
art
beers
up
in
vt
for
the
phish
phlood
benefit
show
glad
i
got
this
one
for
sure
get
it
if
you
can
very
good
seek
it
out
oanother
one
of
those
answers
to
a
question
that
nobody
asked
i
dig
extreme
beers
but
this
one
just
didnt
have
any
reason
to
make
me
want
to
try
this
again
overall
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
but
more
complex
than
some
a
really
nice
beverage
i
had
to
rereview
because
my
palate
was
off
the
first
time
and
im
glad
i
did
good
refreshing
brew
after
a
long
ride
on
kingdom
trails
in
east
burke
it
was
great
to
walk
in
to
a
gas
station
market
and
snag
a
local
beer
in
a
22ounce
bottle
highly
recommended
strong
enough
to
mellow
me
out
after
logging
miles
best
part
solid
flavor
from
start
to
finish
worst
part
i
split
the
bottle
with
a
friend
and
only
had
half
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
in
just
about
any
context
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
in
a
session
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
slightly
cream
texture
and
helps
mask
the
8
abv
well
overall
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
ipa
of
wait
no
i
mean
esb
it
just
not
quite
as
malty
or
balanced
as
i
would
have
thought
for
the
style
not
a
bad
brew
overall
the
aroma
is
the
highlight
here
the
taste
is
not
bad
i
like
bitter
but
its
not
as
balanced
as
it
should
be
leaving
with
a
metalic
taste
d
drinkability
is
moderately
low
much
too
bitter
in
the
taste
without
extracting
much
flavor
from
the
loads
of
hops
in
this
the
flavor
is
uninspired
and
not
overly
pleasant
to
drink
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
definitely
much
hoppier
than
other
more
traditional
esbs
i
want
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
drinkability
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
esb
style
if
the
nose
were
better
on
this
itd
give
three
floyds
lord
admiral
nelson
a
run
for
the
title
of
my
favorite
of
the
style
might
pick
up
again
an
ok
beer
i
might
drink
it
again
but
there
are
better
esbs
out
there
i
like
esbs
notes
this
is
my
first
offering
from
rock
art
a
good
find
and
a
good
one
pick
up
again
cheers
drinks
average
at
best
kind
of

meets

meets
an

will
pass

this
if
you
can
you
wont

the

a

with

from

medium
level
of
carbonation
pretty
good
ipa
but
it
could
probably
use
a
bit
more
malt
backbone
im
not
sure
i
would
ever
attach
a
british
style
designation
to
a
clearly
american
take
on
a
beer
i
enjoyed
it
overall
not
like
any
other
esb
ive
ever
had
the
hoppiness
is
distinctly
american
i
am
not
complaining
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
will
probably
drink
this
again
this
summer
especially
since
its
3
99
a
bomber
drinkability
one
is
enough
for
me
i
struggled
to
finsih
the
one
i
was
on
d
will
definately
have
again
not
a
bad
price
for
a
bomber
either
overall
i
got
a
12
oz
single
and
that
was
enough
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
and
it
fell
o
a
weaker
american
strong
ale
than
esb
not
sessionable
at
all
very
good
but
another
example
of
extreme
beer
that
is
beginning
to
bore
me
id
definitely
have
this
again
but
my
guess
is
that
i
just
wont
d
a
pretty
drinkable
ale
however
i
could
probably
find
many
that
are
more
drinkable
in
this
category
i
consider
this
less
and
esb
and
more
in
the
strong
ale
vein
it
probably
has
a
couple
months
age
on
it
but
it
didnt
really
hinder
the
hop
flavor
that
much
and
i
do
think
it
is
a
relatively
easy
quaff
for
the
8
it
packs
a
nice
balance
compared
to
others
of
its
ilk
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
nonic
pint
amber
color
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
nice
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
toasted
malt
nuts
and
a
bit
of
hop
the
hops
really
come
through
on
the
palate
along
with
biscuity
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
fullbodied
with
some
good
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
bisquit
malt
scent
its
sweet
smelling
with
some
mild
bready
notes
the
hops
are
present
but
take
a
back
seat
to
the
malts
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
solid
malt
bill
thats
big
on
caramel
and
bisquit
malts
its
bitter
but
not
overly
so
at
least
its
balanced
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
piney
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
im
not
sure
its
the
best
esb
but
its
complex
bitter
and
quite
enjoyable
pours
hazy
deep
copper
with
a
dense
cream
colored
head
that
rises
an
inch
above
the
beer
smell
is
dense
and
hoppy
with
pine
and
grapefuit
and
a
thick
caramel
malt
backbone
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
hoppy
with
piles
of
caramel
and
thick
grapefruity
hops
there
is
a
rich
peppery
bitterness
that
clings
to
the
back
of
the
throat
but
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
thin
in
the
middle
with
a
surprising
tealike
quality
d
overall
a
beer
that
does
nothing
to
offend
but
also
doesnt
do
too
much
to
step
away
from
the
pack
good
balance
but
doesnt
come
off
as
smooth
as
many
other
top
esbs
pours
a
very
nice
hazy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice
thickcreamy
twofinger
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
very
nice
thickcreamy
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
note
nice
little
citrus
note
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
a
nice
hop
note
citrus
and
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
my
bottle
has
a
2
on
it
taste
is
extremely
bitter
this
one
lives
up
to
its
reputation
not
really
enough
juicy
hop
flavor
to
go
along
with
it
though
so
it
becomes
a
somewhat
empty
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
levels
a
very
interesting
beer
i
wish
there
was
some
more
depth
and
complexity
to
keep
the
bitterness
from
completely
taking
over
definitely
a
beer
worth
checking
out
though
a
true
extreme
esb
d
moderate
but
enjoyable
i
think
this
is
one
ell
of
a
beer
with
major
points
for
style
and
originality
rock
art
has
really
started
to
impress
me
not
sure
if
id
call
it
a
triple
bitter
but
its
a
malty
dipa
with
some
fantastic
hops
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
stronger
than
average
beer
with
some
good
substance
to
it
that
makes
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
a
decent
esb
id
drink
another
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
very
solid
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
this
was
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
weekend
for
me
overall
smoother
than
i
was
expecting
and
too
easy
to
drink
awesome
beer
and
my
favorite
from
rock
art
notes
the
drinkability
is
not
for
session
i
like
big
beers
and
i
love
beers
that
are
between
8
and
9
and
have
the
booze
well
maskedbut
two
of
these
would
be
fine
for
me
not
hard
to
drinknot
a
sipper
yet
this
could
sneak
up
on
you
a
fine
beer
update
i
did
a
better
pour
on
the
next
bottle
clear
of
all
yeast
it
looks
great
a
nice
deep
amber
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
just
be
careful
when
you
pour
from
a
12oz
bottle
this
one
had
been
aging
for
the
better
part
of
a
year
before
i
finally
tapped
it
its
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
with
a
modicum
of
random
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
thick
piney
hops
and
licorice
alcohol
grapey
malt
beautiful
the
flavor
is
maltwheat
along
the
lines
of
a
barleywine
with
a
mellow
herbal
hop
bitter
edge
and
some
nutty
warmth
it
really
improves
as
it
warms
smooth
and
viscous
mildly
carbonated
very
good
overall
especially
for
a
barleywine
guy
like
me
fair

a
first
taste
for

thanks
kyle
this
is
a
very
respectable
brew
not
for
the
fainthearted
or
for
everyday
but
certainly
interesting
and
pleasant
enough
for
sipping
it
falls
slightly
short
of
greatness
d
average
its
a
big
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
feel
it
if
it
actually
is
8
and
i
doubt
it
it
will
slow
you
down
without
giving
you
a
real
run

your
money
thick

both

almost
want
to
just

it
in

just
long
enough
to
beg
for
another
sip
overall
this
beer
rocks
my
socks
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
bitter
bite
on
the
way
down
its
a
little
too
bitter
with
no
balance
as
a
respite
good
taste
but
a
tad
too
much
if
this
was
labeled
ipa
i
probably
would
have
believed
it
more
than
it
being
labeled
an
esb
so
in
that
respect
it
was
a
let
down
for
a
bitter
fan
like
myself
hop
fans
will
love
it

this
prevails
in
the
taste
as
well
while
the
bitterness
is
in

with
standard
esb
it
lacks
the
malty
backbone
that
makes
me
love
fullers
and
other
standout
beers
of
this
variety
it
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beernothing
offensive
here
but
a
chalky
aftertaste
persists
and
can
only
be
alleviated
by
drinking
more
i
suppose
thats
the
idea
light
to
moderate
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
not
bad
not
excellent
but
i
wouldnt
be
turning
my
nose
up
at
this
in
a
pinch
i
love
a
good
looking
ale
and
this
one
sure
is
pretty
but
aroma
taste
mouthfeel
etc
are
just
slightly
better
than
average
or
maybe
after
all
the
hype
i
was
expecting
more
anyway
if
you
can
pick
it
up
on
sale
or
have
one
offered
to
you
give
it
a
try
the
lingering
sweetness
is
a
bit
odd
but
this
one
is
ok
by
and
large
there
are
better
esbs
out
there
lacking
in

aroma
is
good

this
with

definitely

had
better
representations

this
style
slightly
malty
with
a
weird
sweet
after
taste
not
my
style
i
guess
a
revelation
when
i
first
tasted
this
in
college
in
the
80s
and
to
think
the
brewery
then
was
a
few
blocks
from
my
grandmothers
house
in
ballard
area
was
so
cool
especially
compared
to
the
other

choices

by

are
judged
in
my
experience
really
not
too
bitter

for

i

it
is

then
mellowing
out
into
a
sweeter
scent
the
taste
was
very
good
i
thought
with
all
of
the
notes
being
balanced
very
well
to
make
a
smooth
beer
not
bad
a
nice
pale

bitter

something
with

with
a
slight

goes

american
notes
are
obvious
the
build
of
this
beer
is
actually
very
english
better
than
many
esbs
from
the
old
continent
overall
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
noble
name
of
esb
i
think
it
stands
toe
to
toe
with
any
english
esbs
i
have
ever
tried
i
could
drink
this
everyday
goes
well
with
food
also
great
job
redhook
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
my
problem
is
that
it
is
sort
of
wimpy
dial
up
the
malt
profile
about
50
and
the
hop
profile
100
and
it
would
be
a
winner
as
it
is
its
just
another
average
easy
to
drink
beer
this
beer
is
special
the
red
hook
medicine
bottle
look
is
so
fitting
for
the
thick
sweetness
of
this
beer
i
agree
with
how
many
have
already
noted
it
is
a
beer
you
want
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
how
session
able
it
is
its
a
more
modest
esb
but
it
still
defines
the
genre
in
its
principle
tastes
yet
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
it
its
my
favorite
beer
because
there
is
not
a
beer
that
i
enjoy
have
one
after
the
another
more
than
this
one
o
a
pretty
good
esb
not
as
tasty
as
some
but
ok
at
least
as
a
meal
accompaniment
first
impression
was
that
this
tasted
more
like
beer
than
most
beers
midpack
at
best
o
major
dissapointment
theres
nothing
english
nor
esb
about
this
brew
it
tastes
like
a
corn
tortilla
chip
dipped
in
nyquil
as
macrobrew
tasting
as
any
craft
beer
ive
tried
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
if
the
taste
followed
the
nose
more
it
would
be
better
it
is
kind
of
plain
but
sessionable
i
could
drink
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
dont
love
it
o
a
quality
esb
if
you
are
enticed
by
ipas
but
dont
want
as
much
bitterness
start
here
wont
be
disappointed
pours
a
nice
amber
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
lots
of
bubbles
streaming
up
from
the
bottle
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
grains
with
a
light
fruity
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
actually
mild
and
not
bitter
as
i
was
totally
expecting
for
this
one
very
surprised
for
sure
no
bitter
or
harsh
finish
as
i
thought
when
first
opened
goes
down
pretty
easy
tastes
like
a
good
ale
clear
light
amber
with
a
fine
beige
cap
decent
head
retention
aromas
of
grain
fruity
and
earthy
hops
biscuit
malt
mild
overall
medium
to
low
bitterness
balanced
to
the
sweet
side
a
bit
of
fruity
spicy
hop
character
mineral
finish
with
a
hint
of
lemon
slightly
coarse
light
bodied
average
carbonation
pretty
average
overall
othis
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
beer
this
one
is
okay
but
not
great
deep
head
but
lacks
much
of
an
aroma
if
anything
its
a
little
nutty
decent
carbonation
but
light
body
taste
is
rather
bland
actually
without
any
noticeable
finish
could
definitely
choose
a
better
beer
by
red
hook
im
new
to
beer
advocate
since
i
just
turned
21
i
live
in
woodinvillewa
where
redhook
has
a
big
brewery
so
ive
been
waiting
to
legally
try
them
out
for
a
long
time
i
really
like
the
ebs
by
redhook
nice
beer
to
sip
and
relax
i
buy
them
in
pints
and
will
go
through
the
pint
in
about
35
to
40
mins
it
has
a
warm
bitter
taste
with
just
the
right
amount
of
boldness
a
very
smooth
beer
but
not
creamy
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
only
2
69
for
a
pint
of
good
beer
its
pretty
much
a
steal
just
polished
off
my
first
sixpack
of
this
beer
over
the
past
week
im
very
surprised
by
the
lukewarm
ratings
and
reviews
i
think
its
an
excellent
beer
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
in
fact
it
inspired
me
to
attempt
to
homebrew
a
clone
of
this
beer
if
it
comes
out
anywhere
near
as
good
as
this
beer
then
i
will
be
a
very
camper
in
45
weeks
from
now
i
was
pleased
with
the
first
taste
and
a
bit
surprised
this
is
a
beer
you
car
take
to
the
party
and
share
and
everyone
will
be
glad
you
did
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
for
all
those
weekend
occasions
a
tailgate
or
even
a
baby
shower
where
the
guys
are
invited
d
a
decent
esb
and
nice
job
of
staying
true
to
the
style
nothing
particularly
flawed
however
nothing
very
stand
out
either
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
this
is
a
nice
beer
im
happy
i
had
it
id
have
it
again
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
to
cap
off
a
long
day
i
think
the
best
review
came
from
my
wife
who
said
its
a
beer
i
agree
the
reddhook
esb
is
a
beer
not
a
particularly
an
overthetop
beer
but
its
drinkable
im
just
not
rushing
to
the
store
to
purchase
another
one
anytime
soon
overall
nice
complex
and
malty
with
enough
hops
to
add
some
balance
a
solid
if
not
spectacular
beer
that
is
better
than
most
of
the
rest
of
what
i
have
had
from
redhook
i
could
do
a
couple
on
a
hot
day
but
am
in
no
rush
to
get
it
again
o
it
seems
like
this
beer
has
changed
slightly
over
the
years
but
still
is
one
of
the
industry
standards
in
the
category
due
to
its
lovely
color
solid
malt
body
and
subtle
bitter
finish
redhook
esb
is
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
prefect
for
any
activity
or
season
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
bubbly
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
the
nose
emanated
a
definite
malty
sweetness
with
an
underlying
pinelike
hoppiness
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
could
be
fun
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
malt
and
the
hops
seemed
to
be
having
a
wrestling
match
on
my
tongue
to
see
which
would
emerge
dominant
i
am
going
to
declare
it
a
pleasant
draw
i
could
not
discern
between
one
or
the
other
especially
on
the
finish
i
would
totally
enjoy
this
if
they
put
it
in
a
can
i
liked
it
from
the
bottle
but
i
would
be
hardpressed
to
choose
it
for
away
from
home
in
this
format
the
beer
is
a
light
amber
color
a
foamy
white
head
recedes
to
a
wisp
with
light
white
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subdued
but
toasty
grains
and
a
faint
tealike
hop
presence
emerge
the
beer
tastes
of
toasted
grains
biscuits
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
up
front
some
floral
and
citrusy
hops
bring
in
balance
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
overall
this
isnt
world
class
but
its
balanced
and
complex
enough
to
not
regret
a
6
pack
i
could
see
where
it
hung
around
since
the
80s
when
there
was
nothing
else
like
it
fresh
anyway
but
this
isnt
anything
more
than
average
as
an
amber
or
a
special
bitter
o
good
but
average
this
was
my
first
esb
and
from
what
i
read
it
is
to
be
expected
from
this
style
i
enjoyed
it
but
there
are
just
so
many
other
good
beers
overall
this
beer
provides
a
good
session
beer
it
doesnt
overwhelm
any
of
the
senses
but
gives
you
enough
to
think
over
while
the
glasses
are
going
down
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
is
an
extra
special
bitter
so
dont
go
into
expecting
the
hop
character
and
depth
of
flavor
of
an
american
ipa
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
finger
smells
of
malt
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
toffee
crisp
and
refreshing
feel
to
it
a
tasty
malt
character
with
hops
and
caramel
in
the
background
this
isnt
an
exciting
beer
but
for
its
style
its
a
good
beer
a
good
session
beer
easy
to
forget
this
is
my
first
bottle
in
some
years
a
reminder
oextremely
drinkable
and
pretty
well
balanced
i
am
not
very
well
versed
in
this
style
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
well
done
i
like
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
so
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
not
bad
o
i
like
it
its
not
amazing
but
its
a
fair
esb
id
consider
this
a
session
beer
for
sure
i
could
see
myself
ordering
it
in
a
bar
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
a
six
pack
o
nothing
too
fancy
reminds
me
of
a
smithwicks
or
killians
not
bad
hangout
beer
but
nothing
that
will
blow
your
mind
the
best
of
the
winter
sampler
sans
the
ipa
after
the
atrocious
pilsner
and
amber
this
isnt
half
bad
this
is
a
better
amber
than
their
amber
redhook
extra
special
bitter
3
55
overall
a
pretty
unoffensive
esb
definitely
drinkable
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
without
really
a
thought
nothing
great
but
not
bad
poured
from
a
12
oz
glass
into
a
snifter
pours
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
slight
red
tint
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
in
the
glass
smells
of
fruit
and
not
much
else
tastes
of
grain
mainly
not
much
bitterness
at
all
slight
fruit
flavor
carbonation
is
fine
for
its
light
body
and
finish
is
smooth
overall
a
very
average
beer
o
overall
a
tasty
esb
but
a
tad
too
mild
for
my
liking
much
like
their
ipa
offering
i
feel
as
though
theyve
held
back
a
bit
making
this
mediocre
the
flavour
profile
is
there
it
just
needs
a
bit
more
oomph
olike
i
said
not
a
big
pale
ale
fan
but
if
this
is
an
average
esb
then
i
would
love
to
try
a
good
or
great
esb
could
be
my
exposure
is
mostly
to
nwpa
and
apa
here
in
oregon
but
i
think
i
like
me
some
english
pale
a
good
solid
beer
but
nothing
special
although
it
is
a
tad
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
drinkable
brew
good
for
a
year
round
beer
that
goes
well
with
many
foods
i
always
enjoy
this
one
but
have
had
better
a
decent
esb
basic
flavor
notes
that
are
expected
an
average
beer
all
around
besides
the
disappointing
lack
of
any
head
retention
this
was
a
mediocre
beer
i
would
probably
compare
this
one
to
any
of
the
quasicraft
brews
out
there
like
anything
from
dundee
or
stegmaier
pours
a
clear
goldamber
with
froathy
white
head
good
retention
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of

hops
a
subdued
almost
hidden
earthy
and
citrus
clean
tasting
up
front
light
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
something
darker
hops
take
a
backseat
but
are
earthy
in
character
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
thin
doesnt
have
the
body
i
was
expecting
overall
ok
nothing
special
only
slightly
above
average
overall
in
my
book
great
appearance
but
falls
flat
as
far
as
any
distinctive
standout
appeal
in
the
taste
and
smell
department
a
decent
beer
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
hayward
abbey
rating
74
o
nice
balance
to
everything
with
some
floral
hoppyness
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
minimal
bittering
i
found
this
very
enjoyable
and
would
love
to
compare
it
to
a
tap
version
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
golden
with
a
twofinger
lenght
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
indicating
abundant
carbonation
in
this
beer
i
pick
up
sweet
malts
and
some
citrusy
hops
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
end
its
quite
bready
and
the
citrus
from
the
aroma
comes
through
in
the
taste
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
abundant
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
hits
the
right
notes
what
it
lacks
is
the
wow
factor
but
it
indeed
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
malty
beer
o
very
good
for
that
real
malty
brew
seeker
yum
overall
this
beer
has
is
going
right
at
the
beginning
but
all
the
flavor
just
fades
away
too
quickly
otherwise
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
o
well
i
like
the
beer
but
havent
had
a
whole
lot
of
esbs
over
my
beer
tasting
career
so
to
speak
so
i
will
say
this
ill
have
this
again
hopefully
thats
fair
enough
along
with
other
sides
a
keeper
if
you
like
well
hopped
ales
fairly
good
representation
of
the
style
not
bad
but
not
great
a
worth
afternoon
drink
for
sure
this
is
a
rather
disappointing
beer
it
has
good
hop
character
but
the
malt
character
is
faint
and
more
caramel
than
anything
ill
probably
avoid
this
one
in
future
odecent
wouldnt
search
out
again
descent
and
enjoyable
overall
overall
a
rather
tasty
brew
with
a
bit
more
of
and
an
alcohol
ending
than
the
abv
suggests
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
arrives
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
finger
worth
of
offwhite
head
some
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
average
and
rather
weak
hints
of
caramel
malt
and
a
citrus
hop
but
not
much
to
report
similarly
the
taste
is
lacking
sweet
from
the
caramel
malt
but
nothing
character
faint
bitterness
and
hop
character
lighter
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
middle
of
the
road
brew
overall
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
any
occasion
whether
its
relaxing
in
the
evening
or
watching
a
football
game
its
got
a
simple
yet
rich
flavor
and
a
crisp
feel
to
it
overall
i
still
dont
understand
why
these
things
are
called
extra
special
bitters
but
whatever
this
is
an
approachable
beer
nothing
special
just
an
ok
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
better
it
had
its
moments
but
nothing
too
spectacular
id
probably
try
it
again
though
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
i
noticed
but
from
what
ive
seen
its
garnered
a
hard
following
not
a
bad
esb
for
a
company
that
can
be
bought
just
about
anywhere
i
am
not
big
on
red
hook
but
this
isnt
too
bad
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
sessionable
theres
a
good
amount
of
malts
in
the
beer
but
it
doesnt
feel
filling
only
three
bucks
for
the
22
oz
bottle
i
went
to
their
tour
in
portsmouth
nh
a
little
while
ago
and
they
do
a
great
job
and
you
get
to
try
a
bunch
of
their
beers
all
of
which
are
really
good
as
a
tip
if
you
take
a
map
out
of
the
little
mud
room
there
is
a
coupon
which
will
give
you
a
free
tour
not
that
it
is
expensive
to
begin
with
i
think
it
is
only
like
2
or
something
but
i
figured
id
share
pours
out
a
standard
amber
color
with
very
high
levels
of
transparency
but
only
a
single
finger
of
foam
white
head
with
low
levels
of
lacing
and
poor
retention
aroma
and
flavor
has
some
medium
levels
of
floral
and
citric
hopping
on
top
of
a
biscuit
malt
with
some
mineral
aspects
the
diacetyl
levels
are
stronger
in
the
flavor
than
they
seem
in
the
aroma
still
the
butter
doesnt
get
nearly
as
overwhelming
as
ive
experienced
in
other
beers
and
in
this
case
is
actually
appropriate
to
the
style
i
just
wish
that
the
malt
bill
was
more
interesting
than
the
ambiguous
bread
feel
i
am
presented
with
mediumlight
body
but
not
quite
as
well
carbonated
as
i
would
have
liked
feels
thin
on
the
tongue
pours
light
orangecopper
with
a
half
finger
of
white
head
the
nose
is
quite
bready
there
is
a
distinct
sweet
malty
flavor
accompanied
by
a
little
dryness
on
the
finish
a
refreshing
sessiontype
offering
but
this
beer
is
certainly
nothing
special
o
an
easydrinking
beer
the
flavors
are
not
exceptional
but
it
goes
down
well
and
is
welldone
overall
impression
a
moderately
good
beer
no
major
flaws
but
just
not
very
lively
drinkability
isnt
bad
doesnt
slow
you
down
doesnt
invite
you
back
for
another
d
not
very
drinkable
will
not
have
again
there
seems
to
be
quite
a
bit
going
on
here
for
an
esb
but
it
just
does
not
blend
well
and
leads
to
a
disjointed
mess
of
a
drink
there
also
seems
to
be
some
diacetyl
that
really
ruins
the
flavor
throughout
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
great
for
in
between
foods
or
brews
as
a
palate
cleanser
and
as
a
nice
session
beer
at
the
end
of
a
nice
shift
or
at
a
bbq
pours
a
hazed
amber
ale
with
a
fleeting
finger
of
off
white
foam
smells
of
grain
metal
and
a
hint
of
a
frosted
flakes
tastes
sweet
and
malty
with
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
im
not
really
impressed
with
the
flavor
of
this
beer
i
remember
back
when
i
first
got
into
craft
and
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
nowadays
this
thin
bodied
hi
carbed
sweet
beer
is
mediocre
for
me
imo
an
esb
should
be
only
subtly
sweet
and
have
a
pronounced
complimentary
bittering
on
it
that
results
in
a
feeling
of
slaked
satisfaction
every
esb
i
have
had
tastes
very
different
and
redhook
esb
is
no
exception
its
unique
but
ultimately
it
is
too
sweet
its
a
little
too
malty
given
the
other
flavors
regardless
its
not
bad
odi
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
even
a
few
months
older
than
i
would
have
liked
enjoyable
but
not
extraordinary
would
like
to
try
this
fresher
o
as
an
esb
it
is
kinda
meh
there
is
nothing
astonding
about
it
its
drinkable
but
dont
be
looking
for
something
that
fits
the
english
model
of
what
an
esb
is
it
is
also
very
sweet
a
bit
too
much
for
style
overall
an
ok
esb
a
great
session
beer
id
get
it
at
a
bar
watching
a
game
overall
drinkability
not
my
style
of
beer
but
its
pretty
drinkable
nevertheless
first
few
sips
were
questionable
and
i
didnt
think
id
be
able
to
polish
off
a
sixer
but
after
half
a
bottle
i
adjusted
to
the
profile
and
find
it
more
than
tolerable
overall
this
is
a
solid
option
for
the
price
starts
sweet
and
finishes
bitter
good
brew
this
one
gets
it
mostly
right
though
caramelish
nose
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
in
the
bottle
but
a
slightly
tart
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
not
much
heavier
than
an
american
lager
but
with
buttery
notes
slightly
tart
aftertaste
in
the
finish
if
theres
a
flaw
in
this
its
in
the
aroma
hops
i
can
tell
its
american
hops
in
the
nose
fortunately
not
enough
lemon
pledgepine
sol
flavor
to
be
objectionable
o
this
is
hoppier
than
other
esbs
that
i
have
tried
i
kind
of
prefer
it
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
breweries
out
of
the
northwest
us
the
beers
are
always
a
little
to
malty
for
my
tastes
first
off
this
is
not
an
britishstyle
esb
i
was
hoping
for
it
tastes
similar
but
has
too
much
hop
and
too
much
carbonation
which
makes
it
not
a
smooth
as
the
esb
i
had
in
the
uk
having
it
from
a
bottle
as
opposed
to
a
cask
might
have
something
to
do
with
that
would
try
again
if
i
could
get
it
hand
pumped
o
i
think
this
is
a
good
attempt
at
an
english
esb
but
it
just
falls
a
little
short
of
being
truly
great
i
dont
really
have
any
qualms
with
this
beer
but
wish
it
was
just
a
little
more
balanced
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
its
easy
to
drink
and
yeah
id
buy
this
again
i
just
couldnt
handle
too
much
in
a
sitting
as
it
does
fill
you
up
rather
well
but
oh
well
o
got
the
holiday
pack
in
tucson
over
thanksgiving
break
this
and
the
copperhook
are
the
only
two
i
would
want
again
distinct
tastes
and
smells

a

of

the

that

a

metallic

easy
enough
to

and
certainly
a
step
above
bmc
beers
nothing
to
blow
away
an

could
be
a

but
now
that
it
has
shown
up
in
oklahoma
im
thankful
for
an
easydrinking
flavorful
ale
that
shows
up
at
even
the
most
lite
lager
laden
bars
and
at
3
a

the
price
is
about
right
one
thing
i
really
liked
was
the
drinkability
very
high
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
very
easy
to
have
a
couple
o
redhook
esb
though
not
the
most
amazing
beer
you
will
ever
drink
is
a
bit
underrated
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
in
its
price
range
bottom
line
it
is
a
pleasant
and
wellbalanced
esb
dr
its
very
drinkable
average
abv
and
of
above
average
quality
id
like
to
try
it
on
draught
its
a
very
pleasant
if
understated
brew

slight

this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

clean

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
esb
but
the

are
a

subdued
overall
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
for
its
low

6

99
its
a
decent
fridge
beer
not
the
best
but
it
gets
me
by
not
very
bitter
for
an
extra
special
bitter
o
just
a
fantastic
beer
for
any
occasion
a
rich
complex
flavor
complements
this
approachable
delicious
brew
excellent
ebs
pours
a
almost
hazy
copper

little

the

is
malty

almost
a
little
sweet
the
taste
starts
light
and
sweet
very
malty
but
finishs
more
a
bit
more
bitter
easy
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
mind
grabing
another
one
overall
i
found
this
one
good
and
enjoyable
overall
not
a
bad
little
beer
by
redhook
i
am
glad
i
got
this
one
for
free
because
i
honestly
have
no
reason
to
pay
for
this
cheers
a
shame
the
nose
doesnt
help
the
case
at
hand
a
lawnhousechore
esb
for
all
seasons
meaning
nice
good
acceptable
more
highs
than
lows
but
it
could
be
a
little
more
complex
and
the
hallmark
of
a
great
esb
balanced
poured
from
a
cask
at
the
nh
redhook
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
light
yellowbrown
color
with
no
head
looks
like
muddy
water
aromas
of
buttery
sweet
malt
and
not
much
of
anything
else
the
flavor
is
round
and
muddled
on
a
watery
body
with
characters
of
caramel
and
chocolate
coming
forward
and
a
very
subtle
hops
undertone
remaining
slightly
underbalanced
the
aftertaste
is
a
nutty
caramelchocolate
blend
with
continues
to
remain
smooth
with
a
lingering
slightly
sour
and
citrus
character
the
beers
finish
is
bitter
and
a
little
tart
overall
i
am
left
with
an
underwhelmed
meh
feeling
this
is
certainly
palatable
but
as
far
as
esbs
go
it
falls
a
bit
short
as
a
regular
old
beer
its
serviceable
but
there
are
better
looking
cleaner
tasting
more
delicious
options
out
there
the
feel
is
light
with
good
lively
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
for
me
money
ill
take
some
bitters
from
the
other
side
of
the
pond
thats
just
a
bias
though
another
random
single
from
the
local
binnys
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
sunrise
golden
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuits
orange
peel
flowers
buttery
caramel
and
grass
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
flesh
light
grass
light
buttery
biscuits
and
honey
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
chunky
feel
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
not
too
bad
a
brew
not
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
but
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
in
no
way
offensive
o
this
is
a
winner
for
me
refreshing
but
not
light
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
but
simple
enough
to
just
have
with
your
meal
without
killing
it
im
having
it
with
my
homemade
chive
pancakes
yes
i
cook
so
what
its
a
nice
staple
to
have
in
the
fridge
even
though
i
dint
need
to
stock
up
on
beers
for
the
storm
where
i
am
nothing
happened
but
a
breeze
im
glad
i
did
ill
definitely
go
for
this
again
o
this
was
my
first
beer
from
redhook
and
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
in
the
bottle
cheers
a
very
good
middle
of
the
road
ale
when
you
want
moderate
abv
without
going
too
hoppy
lagery
or
to
a
more
specialty
style
this
beer
definitely
surprised
me
especially
for
such
a
lower
score
and
its
cheap
6
99
a
six
pack
price
you
can
definitely
tell
they
have
the
right
recipe
down
for
this
beer
which
is
why
its
been
brewed
since
i
think
1987
an
exceptional
esb
right
here
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
it
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
scotch
ale
with
shades
of
an
esb
i
wouldnt
go
out
my
way
to
get
this
beer
again
but
im
happy
i
tried
it
overall
this
beers
existence
caused
the
london
riots
poured
a
3
slightly
yellowed
head
clear
light
amber
body
color
medium
malty
smell
taste
was
more
malt
and
minimal
hops
still
this
has
a
lot
more
look
smell
and
flavor
than
most
of
the
bmcs
out
there
and
i
like
the
price
the
bottling
and
the
labeling
so
i
could
see
this
a
great
choice
for
an
everyday
any
purpose
beer
pretty
standard
stuff
i
suppose
nothing
exciting
but
eminently
drinkable
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
with
slight
tinges
of
fruit
from
the
yeast
there
is
a
mild
toasted
taste
with
some
caramel
sweetness
but
the
diacetyl
is
present
it
is
present
but
not
out
of
place
a
good
taste
but
lacks
a
little
in
the
hops
enough
to
bitter
but
lacks
hop
flavor
i
consider
this
just
a
slight
notch
above
most
but
has
little
to
really
separate
it
from
the
pack
overall
decent
beer
awesome
night
would
definitely
do
it
again
o
nicely
done
brew
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
enjoyed
it
more
than
the
bottled
version
however
pours
to
a
oneinch
head
and
bright
coppergold
color
aroma
suggests
caramel
malt
and
sweet
biscuits
there
are
also
some
slight
buttery
and
alcohol
notes
in
the
nose
flavor
is
a
balanced
blend
of
crystal
malt
and
bittering
and
flavor
hops
some
sweet
alcohol
presence
as
well
its
only
5
8
abv
so
why
the
naked
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
good
co2
an
acceptable
us
level
though
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
can
think
of
at
least
two
other
esbs
id
rather
be
drinking
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
breweries
out
of
the
northwest
us
the
beers
are
always
a
little
to
malty
for
my
tastes
first
off
this
is
not
an
britishstyle
esb
i
was
hoping
for
it
tastes
similar
but
has
too
much
hop
and
too
much
carbonation
which
makes
it
not
a
smooth
as
the
esb
i
had
in
the
uk
having
it
from
a
bottle
as
opposed
to
a
cask
might
have
something
to
do
with
that
would
try
again
if
i
could
get
it
hand
pumped
im
struggling
to
figure
out
an
adequate
way
to
describe
the
taste
the
flavors
are
ok
but
they
dont
seem
to
synchronize
i
get
mild
generic
ale
fruitiness
a
minute
amount
of
hops
and
then
a
touch
of
butterscotch
i
feel
like
it
skips
around
a
little
too
quickly
still
enjoyable
even
if
its
far
from
perfect
wouldnt
seek
out
wouldnt
turn
down
it
pours
an
burnt
orange
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
reduced
to
just
a
ring
the
smell
consists
of
sweet
frain
a
hint
of
caramel
and
some
spicy
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
similar
but
first
you
get
the
spicy
hops
and
then
smooth
malt
washes
over
leaving
a
balanced
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
perfect
and
it
has
a
nice
lingering
finish
that
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
this
is
an
all
around
solid
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
the
mouthfeel
follows
the
trend
of
just
above
average
with
some
ok
carbonation
and
ok
bitterness
i
dont
have
great
things
to
say
about
this
beer
its
boring
dull
and
plain
but
still
drinkable
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
im
not
thinking
id
ever
get
some
again
like
any
kind
of
pale
ale
the
fresher
the
better
this
is
just
over
a
month
old
and
i
think
quite
acceptable
im
starting
to
appreciate
attempts
as
subtle
balanced
beers
more
good
brew
overall
easily
accessible
decent
price
i
would
recommend
picking
up
a
sixpack
overall
drinkability
for
a
beer
5
months
after
bottling
not
too
bad
not
a
spectacular
esb
but
it
was
nice
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
despite
my
ambivalence
its
actually
quite
a
drinkable
beer
not
overpowering
in
any
flavor
and
i
could
go
for
another
or
at
least
a
serving
larger
than
12oz
prosit
o
flavorful
and
fairly
clean
in
the
finish
with
a
bitter
that
doesnt
linger
past
its
welcome
medium
crisp
body
taste
is
of
piney
earthy
hops
and
bready
malt
and
caramel
the
finish
is
long
and
bitter
in
my
opinion
the
brew
lacks
some
fruitiness
of
esb
on
the
palate
quite
pleasant
light
without
being
thin
and
easydrinking
pours
golden
with
medium
head
high
lacing
smells
of
chlorine
which
is
why
i
rated
the
smell
low
it
is
pretty
odd
that
it
does
smell
like
chlorine
tastes
of
hops
great
session
beer
ive
only
had
one
other
esb
and
i
loved
it
this
is
a
close
second
disappointing
overall
impression
with
the
light
hopping
this
comes
across
as
a
fairly
average
amber
its
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
the
feel
of
this
beer
medium
to
light
with
a
good
a
crispy
finish
this
happens
to
be
pretty
drinkable
and
would
not
disappoint
a
lover
of
the
style
clear
coppery
orange
color
moderate
carbonation
and
white
to
offwhite
head
fruit
and
hops
aroma
citrus
berry
and
a
touch
of
pine
resin
slightly
floral
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
hops
good
fruit
flavors
with
some
caramel
sweetness
a
touch
of
bitterness
toward
the
end
a
very
decent
wellbalanced
beer
at
a
pretty
nice
price
ok
not
a
must
have
serving
type
bottle
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
the
head
was
creamy
and
white
the
la
in
was
pretty
good
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
grainy
and
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
good
bitterness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watered
down
overall
i
liked
the
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
d
okay
but
really
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
after
a
few
sips
i
cant
tell
if
this
is
some
kind
of
caramel
malts
or
some
off
buttered
popcorn
issues
maybe
a
bit
of
both
there
has
to
be
an
issue
there
is
alot
of
butter
in
here
and
honestly
it
masks
alot
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
hops
come
in
for
a
slight
pine
note
and
the
malts
barely
poke
over
low
carb
and
mod
mouthfeel
something
ill
pass
on
from
now
on
the
mouthfeels
good
though
decent
head
retention
hoppy
aroma
bitter
but
fairly
well
balanced
i
do
agree
with
whomever
made
the
comment
that
this
is
probably
overfiltered
not
as
refined
as
other
examples
but
a
decent
example
for
the
price
and
overall
a
good
beer
for
hot
weather
appearance
is
a
very
light
copper
amber
with
a
fair
head
and
spotty
lace
smell
has
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
giving
way
to
a
sweet
grapefruit
aroma
taste
seems
easy
going
nothing
complex
but
tasty
nontheless
with
light
sweet
malt
with
a
mild
bitter
hop
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
satisfying
easy
going
esb
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thick
head
the
nose
has
a
bunch
of
fruity
hops
and
a
bit
of
sourdough
the
flavor
is
smooth
over
a
creamy
body
after
the
initial
sourdough
bread
body
there
is
a
tingle
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
these
flavors
dissipate
quickly
and
turn
into
a
bitter
bite
that
finishes
rather
dry
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
become
so
sharp
after
such
a
smooth
first
impression
overall
it
is
what
it
is
not
bad
but
not
great
would
do
it
again
but
the
fact
i
only
paid
12
99
for
a
12count
variety
pack
probably
influences
that
decision
quite
a
bit
bottled

nh
this
used
to
be
a
beer
i
enjoyed
but
i
got
into
hoppier
and
more
interesting
beers
i
found
that
i
enjoy
the
really
hoppier
ipas
and
pale
ales
to
this
esb
i
also
prefer
american
hop
varieties
over
european
ones
i
think
this
is
the
standard
for
dms
but
i
cant
remember
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
one
rather
light
bodied
with
decent
bitterness
but
not
much
complexity
its
true
session
beer
but
i
have
tasted
many
better
esbs
on
the
market
during
a
visit
to
portsmouth
we
took
the
opportunity
to
visit
redhook
brewery
tried
the
redhook
esb
the
color
was
golden
clear
with
nice
carbonation
that
gave
way
to
a
decent
white
head
and
lacing
the
nose
was
a
very
faint
citrus
if
any
the
taste
was
good
there
was
a
little
bit
of
hop
and
touch
of
lemon
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
i
certainly
could
do
a
session
with
this
beer
im
surprised
someone
said
this
was
the
clearest
beer
theyve
seen
the
one
i
had
is
very
hazy
little
head
tops
this
orangeyellow
brew
the
smell
and
taste
have
strong
grain
aroma
and
taste
with
hops
mostly
on
the
aftertaste
also
a
little
tart
fruitiness
on
the
aftertaste
but
i
really
taste
the
barely
in
this
beer
its
not
bad
i
probably
wouldnt
get
a
six
pack
of
it
o
i
can
drink
this
if
its
handed
to
me
but
there
are
better
options
so
you
wont
find
it
in
my
fridge
i
thought
about
letting
it
warm
up
so
i
could
pretend
i
was
at
an
overpriced
concert
festival
and
it
was
110
degrees
outside
and
this
was
the
only
option
i
enjoyed
the
taste
overall
but
it
struck
me
as
a
bit
thin
and
mild
and
generally
not
full
bodied
enough
for
an
esb
very
drinkable
though
oh
right
my
taxes
glassware
pint
first
esb
beer
i
have
tried
great
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
and
good
carbonation
smells
of
carmel
malts
taste
a
little
bitter
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
a
smooth
metallic
flavor
lighter
beer
to
drink
not
my
favorite
redhook
beer
i
had
like
i
said
before
maybe
seattle
should
stick
to
coffe
and
throwing
fish
maybe
my
6
monthold
bottle
is
skunked
im
just
not
impressed
here
at
all
an
above
average
micro
id
say
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
similiar
not
a
bad
brew
but
only
a
little
above
average
drinks
decently
pretty
average
for
the
style
a
nice
beer
but
there
are
way
better
choices
for
the
style
usually
out
of
the
bottle
but
tastes
better
draft
into
a
pint
glass
pours
light
amber
with
almost
no
head
at
the
start
but
this
lasts
and
leaves
a
little
weak
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
hint
of
caramel
and
grain
but
mostly
apple
juice
the
taste
is
malt
grain
apple
juice
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
1st
it
seems
too
bitter
and
drying
on
the
toungue
but
this
goes
away
after
the
1st
couple
sips
with
all
mellowing
out
and
blending
togther
into
a
solid
drinkable
beer
with
a
fairly
well
rounded
body
a
decent
session
beer
but
had
way
better
and
it
has
a
grainy
aftertaste
appearance
is
a
orangyamber
color
nice
two
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
looks
like
its
giving
ok
lacing
nice
hop
bite
in
the
nose
and
a
definite
sweet
malt
note
in
the
back
end
of
the
smell
wow
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
at
all
i
was
expecting
a
generic
ale
taste
but
i
got
something
weird
i
hardly
get
any
hop
bite
like
almost
none
at
all
instead
i
get
a
malt
mixed
with
sweetness
taste
its
almost
a
little
gross
i
dunno
its
really
weird
i
mean
you
get
the
sweetness
before
you
even
get
the
malt
the
malt
is
in
the
back
end
and
like
i
said
the
hop
is
almost
non
existent
for
a
beer
this
color
and
with
this
smell
i
was
expecting
much
more
hops
than
anything
else
not
very
impressive
here
at
all
d
was
given
to
me
as
a
gift
im
glad
i
didnt
go
out
and
buy
it
on
my
own
there
just
isnt
a
lot
of
taste
or
character
to
this
quaff
wont
be
having
another
on
any
set
frequency
i
hadnt
had
a
redhook
esb
in
awhile
remembered
it
as
a
solid
brew
after
my
growth
as
a
beer
drinker
i
find
it
now
to
be
a
decent
mediocre
beer
still
not
bad
nice
and
sessionable
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
quite
like
it
used
to
this
isnt
good
but
not
bad
enough
that
i
would
turn
away
a
free
one
redhook
isnt
a
stellar
brewery
by
any
means
but
this
is
not
good
compared
to
their
other
beers
overall
this
is
ok
but
not
stellar
live
and
learn
enjoy
with
meats
and
fish
notes
recommended
though
i
have
had
only
a
few
esb
style
beers
to
compare
this
one
with
stylistically
but
it
seems
like
a
generally
good
reliable
beer
rjt
not
highly
drinkable
didnt
care
for
this
beer
overall
the
esb
from
deschutes
is
much
more
pleasant
i
used
to
drink
this
quite
a
bit
back
in
the
90s
and
finally
revisited
it
what
a
disappointment
i
guess
either
the
recipe
changed
or
my
palate
grew
final
notes
an
average
beer
not
one
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
definitely
much
better
esbs
out
there
its
ok
average
in
all
areas
better
than
the
big
guys
but
not
comparable
to
a
lot
of
craft
breweries
this
poured
copper
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
it
smelled
and
tasted
malty
and
sweet
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
similar
to
winterhook
only
not
as
good
there
was
a
certain
grainynutty
flavor
that
set
it
apart
from
winterhook
however
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
bitter
i
did
drink
this
after
a
celebration
ale
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
this
beer
was
fine
but
i
cannot
see
myself
buying
this
again
db
has
a
solid
flavor
but
the
watery
body
makes
the
overall
experience
weaker
maybe
a
bit
more
citrus
than
i
would
expect
in
the
style
as
well
flavor
sort
of
loses
balance
as
i
drink
more
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
im
drinking
alone
on
the
weekends
at
the
same
time
its
something
id
order
at
a
bar
if
i
didnt
feel
like
choosing
from
the
selection
not
too
strong
not
too
weak
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
making
for
a
very
good
allpurpose
beer
usually
can
find
it
decently
priced
too
which
is
also
important
d
a
nice
relaxing
brew
to
pass
the
time
good
session
beer
md
nice
drinking
brew
good
deapth
kinda
hard
to
place
my
finger
on
the
actual
flavors
drinks
smooth
and
leaves
a
slight
maltiness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
quite
drinkable
ale
i
am
actually
much
happier
with
this
than
i
expected
great
price
with
a
sixer
for
nine
bucks
not
a
bad
brew
or
anything
special
just
not
one
i
would
seek
out
all
in
all
this
is
nothing
you
need
to
worry
about
extra
special
bitter
this
is
an
esb
there
is
not
bitter
anywhere
in
here
shouldnt
a
brewery
know
how
to
categorize
there
beer
this
is
false
advertising
in
my
opinion
ive
had
a
boat
load
of
more
bitter
brews
and
this
is
not
bitter
by
any
means
d
the
drinkabililty
of
this
beer
is
fairly
decent
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
could
definitely
put
back
6
or
more
of
them
in
a
sitting
if
i
had
the
inclination
to
d
im
not
an
expert
on
esbs
but
i
think
this
one
isnt
too
bad
sure
not
perfectly
to
style
or
maybe
even
close
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
price
is
decent
enough
but
i
would
never
pay
more
than
7
for
a
6er
of
this
hopefully
they
dont
dumb
it
down
any
further
pours
a
light
caramelcopper
color
with
a
faint
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
through
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
notes
as
well
as
some
light
earthy
and
herbal
hops
the
taste
adds
in
a
touch
of
citrus
atop
a
bit
of
light
bread
some
slight
but
noticeable
bitterness
resides
within
the
feel
drinks
pretty
well
id
be
willing
to
go
for
seconds
i
could
easily
swirl
1012
back
overall
a
very
decent
brew
ill
buy
it
when
its
on
sale
as
i
do
with
fat
tire
or
sam
adams
ales
or
lagers
wouldnt
turn
one
down
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
nice
orangish
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
crown
with
some
errant
bubbles
little
lacing
smell
of
some
spice
and
pepper
mixed
with
malts
a
faint
fruit

as
well

is
malty
with
the
fruit
a
little
more
pronounced
and
a
spicy
finish
feel
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
be
having
it
again
d
pretty
good
beer
decent
price
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
esbs
overall
stellar
color
and
clarity
really
help
the
experience
d
pretty
drinkable
got
a
little
sweeter
than
i
normally
like
as
it
warmed
up
to
room
temp
d
would
be
good
if
not
for
that
sticky
sweet
residue
that
it
leaves
in
my
mouth
i
couldnt
drink
much
of
this
even
though
its
light
doverall
this
is
a
huge
disappointment
this
was
the
first
microbrew
i
ever
had
over
20
years
ago
i
used
to
like
this
either
my
tastes
have
changed
since
joining
ba
probable
or
this
beer
is
not
brewed
the
way
it
used
be
likely
or
both
the
redhook
website
calls
this
an
amber
ale
it
wouldnt
rate
any
better
under
that
style
i
was
hoping
this
might
have
a
place
since
it
was
my
craft
beer
introduction
unfortunately
it
will
only
be
a
memory
there
is
a
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
that
adds
to
the
balance
and
overall
quality
definitely
not
a
session
beer
due
to
being
filling
and
with
a
mild
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
redhook
esb
original
ale
is
a
good
representation
of
the
esb
style
recommended
pours
clear
amber
with
a
small
soapy
white

good
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma

smooth

spicy

medium
crisp

the
flavor

with

woody
spicy

and
light

the
finish
is
peppery
and
has
cotton
candylike
sweetness
refreshing
what
can
i
say
i
think
this
is
better
than
other
reviews
have
suggested
not
that
my
taste
buds
are
better
than
others
but
it
makes
me
wonder
if
most
tastings
should
be
blind
including
my
own
d
drinkable
in
the
way
of
a
couple
pints
for
me
anyway
i
didnt
like
the
sweet
flavor
profile
with
the
absence
of
hop
flavors
bitterness
to
balance
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
recommend
or
would
come
back
to
unless
i
was
on
a
budget
pass
d
high
co2
makes
this
hard
to
drink
for
me
i
could
probably
only
have
one
them
move
on
to
a
more
session
able
beer
overall
this
is
much
better
than
i
remember
it
being
from
the
bottle
far
from
great
but
easy
to
drink
with
a
light
but
solid
flavor
profile
worth
a
shot
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
toasty
notes
slightly
fruity
and
nutty
with
just
a
hint
of

bitterness
lightmedium
bodied
and
well
almost
overly
carbonated
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
lacking
any
real
character
not
bad
but
not
spectacular
d
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
but
would
try
again
perhaps
on
tap
schizo
blandtasty
richthin
refreshing
depending
on

year
mood
drinks
like
an
absolute
champ
i
have
to
stop
myself
from
drinking
it
really
quickly
all
around
a
nice
flavor
and
i
can
understand
why
this
is
the
commercial
standard
for
the
style
in
the
u
s
if
they
amped
the
flavor
up
a
couple
notches
it
could
be
fantastic
a
beer
that
falls
into
that
particular
nomans
land
well
above
bmc
sure
and
definitely
drinkable
but
lacking
in
the
roundness
and
fullness
that
would
land
it
among
the
ranks
of
the
crafty
golden
boys
of
the
genre
poured
into
10oz
glass
poured
a
clean
clear
goldamber
color
with
just
a
thin
cap
of
white
head
that
low
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
benignly
balanced
combination
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
slight
hop
tang
the
taste
is
likewise
neutral
and
semibland
the
body
is
nicely
crisp
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
theres
been
times
when
ive
had
several
of
these
over
the
course
of
the
day
and
enjoyed
every
one
overall
a
decent
solid
unspectacular
beer
much
better
than
bmc
type
brews
taste
is
sweet
again
fruity
with
a
sour
rather
than
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
a
little
flat
surprising
based
on
the
looks
drinkable
good
for
a
baseball
game
on
a
hot
day
i
suppose
d
i
could
cuddle
up
to
this
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
my
wonderful
fiance
always
cuddling
up
to
me
its
nothing
unique
but
its
tasty
so
who
cares
d
this
is
a
beer
that
is
actually
not
too
shabby
it
doesnt
get
much
respect
by
some
but
overall
i
find
it
to
be
a
worthy
intro
to
craft
beer
this
is
a
damn
good
approximation
of
a
british
bitter
its
quaffable
and
makes
me
interested
in
their
brown
ale
drinkability
is
high
ill
buy
again
easy
to
down
and
on
par
with
other
beers
of
the
same
price
range
i
used
to
think
this
was
a
classy
brew
when
i
didnt
know
about
beer
now
its
pretty
average
revisiting
a
beer
that
was
an
early
1990s
staple
for
me
pours
amber
in
color
with
modest
carbonation
that
forms
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipate
leaving
a
few
little
bits
of
lace
behind
and
a
thin
collar
of
foam
smells
of
apricot
and
marmalade
and
touch
sour
lactic
which
is
odd
tastes
of
buttery
malt
and
a
bit
of
caramel
balanced
by
fruity
yeastiness
and
lightly
bitter
hops
tastes
british
and
is
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
really
exciting
going
on
here
a
good
first
beer
in
a
session
or
an
ale
to
session
while
something
else
is
going
on
like
a
chicago
blackhawks
game
drinkability
i
am
not
impressed
seems
weak
for
a
micro
brew
drinkability
not
an
offensive
beer
but
nothing
exciting
this
is
one
of
the
more
affordable
esbs
out
there
but
i
still
cant
see
myself
buying
this
one
again
the
bottle
is
fairly
transparent
and
you
can
see
how
clear
the
beer
is
without
even
the
courtesy
of
a
pour
continuing
in
the
trend
of
moulded
glass
the
bottle
shows
wheat
in
relief
along
with
what
i
have
to
assume
are
mountains
from
their
logo
the
beer
is
the
colour
of
clear
honey
with
a
light
beige
head
that
stretches
tall
after
even
the
lightest
agitation
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
hops
and
little
else
sipping
it
this
beer
personifies
the
trend
towards
a
strong
hops
flavour
with
a
background
of
grains
its
very
dry
in
the
mouth
and
the
bitter
qualities
seem
to
leave
the
palate
more
bereft
of
moisture
after
drinking
than
it
had
before
the
beer
is
a
little
too
simple
and
a
little
too
one
directional
while
it
would
be
easy
to
learn
to
appreciate
this
beer
id
prefer
to
avoid
having
to
do
so
dvery
easy
drinking
and
could
be
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
for
someone
as
it
gets
all
of
the
great
esb
qualities
and
is
not
overwhelming
picked
up
a
mix
twelve
pack
this
past
friday
for
a
bbq
with
my
brother
there
were
three
esb
bottles
included
poured
into
an
irish
style
pint
glass
dark
brownish
red
color
moderate
white
head
that
quickly
faded
down
to
nothing
good
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
a
bit
of
prickly
black
pepper
taste
was
very
agreeable
very
nice
upfront
malt
profile
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
slight
caramel
flavor
also
noticed
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
it
helped
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
the
very
mild
flavor
and
the
overall
smoothness
made
this
beer
a
nice
afternoon
brew
to
drink
with
our
burgers
overall
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
great
color
but
the
taste
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
there
is
a
nice
malthops
flavor
that
stays
with
you
though
pours
a
copper
color
with
about
a
1
inch
head
that
doesnt
leave
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
predominantly
malt
with
some
fruitiness
some
grain
and
slight
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
but
i
pick
up
an
unpleasant
metallic
taste
also
a
little
too
watery
for
my
tastes
decent
mouthfeel
and
pretty
good
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
regret
buying
a
6
pack
of
this
by
any
means
as
it
was
worth
trying
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again

pressed

poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
copper
with
a
loose
fizzy
one
inch
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dispersed
into
a
fairly
consistent
skim
before
settling
into
a
swirl
and
a
thin
band
around
the
shoulders
some
spots
of
lacing
but
no
legs
nose
reveals
caramel
malt
up
front
with
a
suggestion
of
aromatic
hops
in
the
background
with
the
addition
of
some
light
fruity
esters
dispersed
in
the
mix
taste
consistent
with
nose
much
maltier
than
i
anticipated
for
the
style
starts
out
sweet
upfront
with
some
bitterness
coming
out
towards
the
finish
fruity
quality
reveals
itself
as
the
brew
begins
to
warm
but
is
overshadowed
by
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
assertive
almost
prickly
carbonation
that
does
a
nice
job
of
adding
some
crispness
and
breaking
up
the
maltiness
in
the
flavor
profile
i
was
anticipating
a
less
malty
more
subdued
brew
with
a
little
more
hops
presence
however
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
maybe
not
spot
on
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
but
not
bad
carbonation
and
malty
backbone
make
it
a
little
difficult
to
session
though
this
beer
pours
a
goldenamber
color
clear
but
my
beer
seemed
to
have
a
bit
of
yeast
still
in
the
bottle
but
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
the
head
was
about
a
half
inch
tall
and
stayed
around
for
a
while
with
a
good
bit
of
lacing
taste
is
very
good
but
the
bitterness
wasnt
as
extreme
as
i
had
expected
this
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
very
drinkable
it
think
this
would
have
gone
great
with
some
hot
wings
and
is
a
good
beer
to
just
sit
on
the
back
porch
and
enjoy
taste
is
malty
and
bready
with
a
nice

finish
the
entire
mouthfeel
is

at

this

i

had

a

then
many

of

the

in
what
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
style
tasting
it
now
i
get
notes
of
sweet
malts
but
still
that
little
kick
of
bitterness
to
me
this
a
good
sessionable
beer
at

that
is
still
a
step
up

above
the
low

and
can
save
you
a

bucks
if
trying

watch
the
budget
found
it
didnt
dazzle
me
at

but
is
a
beer
that
really
grows
on
you
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
and
think
it
would
be
a
good
first
step
into

an

works

with

for
the

pass
if
you
have
another
option

which
is
clean
with
some

and
not
much
else
to
taste
all
the
flavors
of

esb
are
there
per
se
malty
drinkable
enough
when
you
are
in
the
budweiser
lounge
at
the
las

airport
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
havent
had
one
in
awhile
not
bad
in
a
pinch
d
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinking
esb
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
a
bit
light
in
some
flavor
departments
still
a
decent
choice
any
day
plenty
of
flavor
here
but
it
just
doesnt
come
together
quite
right
does
taste
fresh
doubt
i
would
turn
this
down
at
a
party
none
too
complex
this
would
make
a
very
good
beer
for
quaffing
very
wellbalanced
simple
yet
complex
enough
to
stray
from
boring
with
an
alcohol
content
in
just
the
right
range
i
am
starting
to
like
pale
ales
and
ipas
more
now
that
i
drink
with
a
reviewing
eye
and
mouth
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
one
beer
pours
an
attractive
burnt
orange
with
a
small
amount
of
head
and
decent
lacing
however
was
expecting
more
of
a
hops
bitterness
and
was
surprised
by
this
beers
mild
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
well
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
someone
handed
me
one
but
i
wont
be
actively
seeking
out
this
brew
in
the
future
overall
a
rather
boring
brew
nothing
exceptional
or
offensive
i
find
myself
writing
this
a
lot
when
reviewing
redhook
beers
probably
will
never
buy
again
considering
the
multitude
of
choices
available
drinkability
it
is
a
beer
that
i
could
buy
just
to
drink
a
pretty
good
beer
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
thought
it
might
be
though
copper
color
and
poured
a
small
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
a
strong
hoppy
flavor
some
sweet
malts
with
a
bitter
fruity
finish
pretty
nicely
balanced
and
easy
drinking
id
have
it
again
d
this
is
a
good
beer
its
a
really
really
solid
brew
you
can
get
relatively
cheap
its
just
not
a
good
esb
buy
to
enjoy
but
dont
buy
fullers
or
something
else
if
you
want
a
good
example
of
what
an
esb
is
supposed
to
be
i
did
manage
to
drink
my
pint
without
issue
but
it
was
not
a
particularly
enjoyable
beer
experience
i
enoyed
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
i
will
buy
again
this
beer
has
a
pleasant
clear
copperyamber
color
in
the
glass
but
this
translates
far
too
literally
into
a
flavor
suggestive
of
a
red
tea
steeped
with
grubbyhere
i
echo
previous
reviewers
pennies
on
top
of
this
odd
and
utterly
unrewarding
metallic
flavor
it
is
sweet
with
an
overbearing
unintegrated
sweetness
like
a
shot
of
molasses
added
at
the
end
of
brewing
i
think
i
have
liked
other
beers
by
these
guys
summer
rye
in
particular
but
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
by
a
major
brewer
i
have
had
bad
batch
overall
this
is
one
of
redhooks
better
offerings
its
not
bad
at
all
and
is
worth
a
try
for
a
flagship
beer
not
a
bad
style
or
representation
but
it
should
be
near
perfect
and
its
not
the
diacetyl
is
a
bit
much
and
slightly
askew
leaving
flavors
and
aftertastes
out
of
whack
at
times
pours
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
scent
that
isnt
over
powering
the
bitter
aspect
to
this
beer
is
minimal
and
makes
a
great
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
dthis
one
will
go
high
on
my
list
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
lightmedium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
plenty
drinkable
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
d
good
not
bad
i
would
definitely
try
this
on
tap
redhook
esb
i
hadnt
had
one
in
a
long
time
so
i
figured
i
would
revisit
while
available
on
draft
this
specimen
was
served
on
tap
in
a
16
oz
pint
glass
it
smells
slightly
sweet
and
very
malty
but
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
shines
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
has
a
smooth
subtle
hop
bitterness
hidden
behind
the
maltiness
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
has
a
overall
smoothness
in
mouthfeel
like
very
few
beers
ive
ever
had
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
many
pints
of
this
esb
there
is
nothing
terribly
exciting
or
special
about
this
beer
but
it
is
very
good
edit
just
read
through
some
other
reviews
and
i
am
more
confused
nobody
seems
to
have
the
spiciness
and
most
seem
to
mention
citrus
hops
tastes
of
quality
hops
with
hints
of
citrus
that
balance
with
sweeter
malts
a
well
balanced
tasty
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
light
to
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
overall
i
enjoyed
this
but
its
not
anything
that
deserves
to
be
sought
out
other
it
is
what
it
isgood
example
of
what
an
esb
is
supposed
to
be
a
beer
that
has
wellbalanced
maltyhoppy
characters
d
its
drinkable
and
certainly
wont
offend
anyone
but
the
lack
of
character
left
me
bored
about
34
of
the
way
through
the
glass
could
i
drink
another
sure
would
i
want
to
if
given
the
choice
between
this
and
other
craft
beers
probably
not
a
good
beer
to
share
with
your
friends
and
enjoy
early
but
youll
want
to
move
on
from
this
d
a
decent
esb
but
not
overwhelming
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
a
better
beer
than
it
is
an
esb
if
that
makes
any
sense
for
me
it
will
be
for
occasional
use
only
cheers
d
it
is
fairly
drinkable
although
its
uncomplicated
and
lightly
flavored
d
this
is
an
okay
esb
it
served
as
a
gateway
beer
for
me
in
college
that
led
to
drinking
better
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
little
head
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
kind
of
fruity
thats
all
i
can
really
say
about
it
theres
a
really
delicate
caramel
malt
taste
which
is
kind
of
nice
it
starts
and
finishes
really
dry
which
i
dont
really
care
too
much
for
medium
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
this
would
probably
be
a
decent
summertime
beer
but
i
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
again
pretty
good
ale
worth
a
try
d
i
could
put
these
down
nothing
too
crazy
but
it
does
mix
it
up
a
bit
has
some
complexity
but
nothing
that
is
going
to
kill
your
palate
dig
it
d
easily
a
great
session
beer
i
may
make
this
part
of
my
regular
purchases
nothing
overwhelming
or
mindblowing

very
nice
dry
bitter
ale
paired
well
with
a
meal
of
seared
scallops
poured
into
a
pint
glass
ambercopper
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
stays
a
14
the
entire
session
the
aroma
is
sort
of
bland
but
i
have
yet
to
smell
and
esb
that
has
a
great
aroma
the
taste
is
a
sharp
bitter
bite
upfront
and
drying
effect
to
the
palate
from
the
hops
the
malt
is
sufficent
to
help
balance
but
the
hops
dominant
the
body
is
spot
on
the
drying
effect
is
little
much
after
two
a
great
version
of
the
style
and
maybe
the
best
brew
i
have
had
from
redhook
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
touch
of
amber
color
nice
sized
persistant
head
aroma
is
herbal
hops
with
a
touch
of
toasted
maltiness
light
toasted
malt
flavor
fairly
low
sweetness
herbal
hops
with
a
citrus
note
not
all
that
much
going
on
medium
bodied
pretty
drinkable
overall
this
is
pretty
average
not
particularly
exciting
but
not
bad
at
all
d
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
try
again
this
has
about
80
of
the
total
package
going
for
it
just
a
gaping
hold
in
the
middle
enjoy
one
of
these
it
wont
disappoint
prosit
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
faint
mineral
citrus
then
vague
light
caramel
vague
apple
mineral
citrus
and
leaf
it
has
a
lightly
bitter
finish
that
fades
pretty
fast
to
a
grainy
aftertaste
all
elements
are
rather
light
and
thin
a
bit
vague
and
the
aftertaste
dos
not
take
long
to
fade
to
a
general
watery
character
and
the
whole
thing
is
rather
thin
and
watery
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
good
session
that
i
will
pick
up
again
while
just
hanging
out
not
one
you
have
to
think
too
hard
about
but
still
has
some
substance
to
it
d
it
was
refreshing
but
i
remembered
this
beer
being
a
lot
better
a
few
years
back
when
i
first
had
it
perhaps
my
standards
are
higher
now
a
decent
beer
but
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
it
up
but
at
the
same
time
would
not
refuse
if
offered
to
me
try
it
out
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
very
refreshing
this
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
good
session
beer
i
could
spend
a
night
drinking
this
with
no
problems
doesnt
overpower
you
drinkability
very
drinkable
simple
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
and
still
want
for
more
great
great
beer
well
done
redhook
verdict
redhook
esb
is
a
very
drinkable
and
complex
bitter
ale
dont
be
spooked
by
the
new
packaging
this
beer
is
still
a
worldclass
icon
i
can
see
enjoying
a
few
rounds
of
this
in
a
beer
garden
during
a
sunny
saturday
afternoon
or
in
a
pub
with
some
mates
on
a
saturday
night
i
guess
the
takeaway
here
is
that
this
is
a
great
beer
for
saturdays
d
it
is
more
interesting
than
a
bad
beer
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
go
for
a
sixpack
i
imagine
it
would
go
well
with
a
dinner
though
maybe
chicken
d
drinkability
was
very
good
not
overly
complex
or
flavorful
imo
but
good
nonetheless
drinkability
is
excellent
i
drank
every
last
drop
of
this
beer
and
would
gladly
have
gone
for
a
few
more
rounds
given
the
opportunity
but
ill
definitely
be
searching
for
more
of
this
beer
to
add
to
my
personal
rotation
poured
a
nice
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
very
inviting
a
little
malt
on
the
nose
and
not
much
hops
very
light
aroma
though
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
little
more
hop
than
malt
on
the
finish
really
no
detectable
alcohol
taste
but
a
bit
of
warming
as
it
went
down
very
nice
really
suits
my
taste
medium
light
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
very
drinkable
will
buy
more
of
this
one
again
i
appreciate
where
the
brewers
are
coming
from
making
this
type
of
beer
but
once
i
got
about
75
of
the
way
through
i
honestly
didnt
even
want
to
finish
it
the
taste
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
dont
plan
on
trying
this
again
out
of
a
bottle
i
am
still
willing
to
get
this
on
tap
as
i
may
have
just
had
a
bad
bottle
as
long
as
someone
else
is
willing
to
pay
overall
it
was
a
tasty
esb
id
certainly
try
it
not
bad
and
not
bland
served
in
a
lager
glass
looks
a
nice
amber
with
a
slight
haze
and
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
very
sweet
bready
malts
almost
like
a
sweet
bread
the
flavor
carries
the
same
bready
taste
and
finishes
with
mild
grassy
and
citrus
hops
this
beer
could
also
me
a
very
smooth
american
amber
but
also
works
as
an
american
adaptation
of
an
esb
d
very
drinkable
if
the
taste
was
a
little
more
powerful
i
would
make
a
point
of
having
this
one
around
regularly
d
good
beer
to
have
during
this
time
of
year
will
definitley
keep
this
in
mind
for
times
to
come
honey
colored
with
almost
no
head
unique
malty
smell
almost
almond
like
or
amaretto
sweetness
to
it
maybe
toffee
taste
is
light
nuttiness
again
maybe
of
almonds
is
smooth
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
and
fairly
good
overall
easy
drinking
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
1
of
these
d
pretty
good
nothing
overly
outstanding
but
a
great
session
brew
good
to
enjoy
when
doing
something
remedial
as
it
is
tasty
but
you
dont
necessarily
have
to
think
about
it
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinkablity
easily
sessionable
tasty
brew
plenty
of
flavor
to
satisfy
d
an
okay
beer
but
not
a
great
and
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
revisit
the
earthy
tones
were
not
for
me
could
probably
put
a
few
back
without
being
too
dissapointed
but
there
is
too
much
better
beer
to
try
nothing
bad
about
this
one
but
nothing
great
overall
pretty
dull
and
bland
a
pattern
im
starting
to
detect
from
red
hook
seems
like
they
were
better
before
the
anheuserbusch
buyin
im
not
sure
why
some
people
have
commented
on
the
beers
lack
of
head
because
after
shaking
the
jug
the
first
half
of
the
beer
was
nothing
but
head
anyway
this
americanized
version
of
an
esb
was
somewhat
too
bitter
for
my
liking
but
overall
it
was
a
yummy
beer
sans
the
stupid
milk
jug
dcould
enjoy
any
time
night
or
dayone
or
fourwhos
countingthis
is
a
simple
brew
with
plenty
of
characternot
amazingbut
well
done
m
d
very
low
carbonation
as
standard
for
most
bitters
very
smooth
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
i
would
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
good
carbonation
meduim
bodied
beer
leaves
a
little
lace
i
really
like
this
beer
visited
the
washington
location
a
while
back
great
time
took
my
wife
and
our
7
month
old
on
the
tour
we
all
had
fun
good
session
beer
will
drink
again
follows
style
nicely
dispite
the
bitter
fruit
taste
the
beer
was
very
smooth
with
so
many
beers
still
to
try
in
the
world
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
one
overall
a
good
and
easy
drinking
esb
at
first
pour
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
as
the
aroma
though
complex
wasnt
very
aggressive
at
all
the
first
taste
wasnt
incredibly
aggressive
either
i
took
a
long
pull
and
mulled
it
and
found
what
makes
this
ale
special
for
a
bitter
this
is
an
exceptionally
smooth
and
balanced
ale
its
smooth
drinking
and
i
appreciated
the
depth
of
flavors
more
and
more
with
each
swig
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
wasnt
anything
special
after
reading
some
reviews
im
beginning
to
think
maybe
i
received
a
not
so
fresh
bottle
d
always
tastes
pretty
good
but
makes
you
wish
redhook
spent
more
time
on
beer
and
less
time
on
advertising
and
distribution
because
they
have
a
nice
starting
point
for
this
beer
but
it
could
be
a
lot
better
better
ontap
than
in
the
bottle
but
it
depends
on
the
pour
also
had
a
pint
ontap
at
mellow
mushroom
in
chattanooga
tn
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
good
retention
smells
and
tastes
were
pretty
basic
although
not
bad
sweet
malt
honey
a
little
grainy
no
real
balancing
bitterness
loose
mouthfeel
but
not
watery
an
easy
drinker
lots
of
honey
sweetness
but
no
exceptional
character
a
very
enjoyable
esb
surprisingly
complex
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
if
offered
at
a
friends
house
i
would
drink
it
this
is
a
really
safe
beer
to
offer
friends
who
would
like
to
try
something
other
than
a
bmc
deliciously
hoppy
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
and
probably
my
favorite
overall
from
redhook
very
well
balanced
by
the
caramel
malt
finishes
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
as
it
should
not
a
big
beer
in
terms
of
the
hop
flavor
but
is
easily
drinkable
and
a
good
starter
beer
for
those
trying
to
get
into
beers
that
have
more
hops
and
bitterness
poured
a
very
golden
light
amber
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
that
surprisingly
left
a
thin
ring
of
spotty
and
fine
lacing
the
beers
nose
was
kind
of
tame
and
uneventful
and
the
flavor
was
a
balanced
light
hoppiness
with
a
malt
character
that
transitioned
to
a
iced
tea
like
character
as
it
slid
across
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
hindered
by
my
own
personal
lack
of
interest
in
this
particular
beer
i
like
this
style
but
better
examples
of
it
exist
pours
very
cloudy
with
virtually
no
head
in
the
glass
it
has
an
orangered
color
smell
is
sweet
sharp
and
light
starts
oily
bitter
and
rather
crisp
medium
body
with
a
slight
caramel
flavor
somewhat
sour
but
the
bitters
increase
as
it
settles
on
your
tongue
finishes
like
cough
syrup
and
quite
wet
presents
a
strong
and
bitter
aftertaste
that
lasts
copped
a
12oz

very
slight

and
slight

was

the
taste
with

certainly
not
as
bitter
as
i
thought
it
would
be
more
on
the
sweetside
if
anything
a
really
good
american
brew
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
good

and
a
good

make
for
easy

a
hazy

almost
no

is
what
i
expect
from
a
bitter
flowers
and
citrus
light
and
refreshing
taste
its
a
very
drinkable
session
bitter
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
and
its
one
that
ill
probably
drink
again
soon
this
is
an
easytodrink
esb
from
redhook
the
redhook
brewery
in
woodinville
wa
is
across
the
street
from
the
chateau
ste
michelle
winery
and
the
columbia
crest
winery
a
wonderful
place
to
relax
being
originally
a
seattleite
i
came
of
age
drinking
redhook
when
it
was
one
of
the
first
breakthrough
micro
brew
which
brought
craft
brewing
to
the
mainstream
i
digress
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
from
the
bottle
a
reddish
gold
color
with
a
head
which
dissipates
to
a
lace
quickly
hoppiness
is
the
first
thing
that
grabs
me
followed
by
sweet
maltiness
the
taste
follows
the
nose
except
the
malty
characteristics
are
slightly
more
pronounced
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
it
has
changed
over
the
years
definitely
like
it
on
tap
better
and
i
like
the
look
of
the
original
bottle
much
better
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
fruitiness
to
balance
the
wonderful
maltiness
of
this
beer
purchased
as
a
single
bottle
in
the
discount
basket
at
my
local
store
poured
into
a
pint
glass
maybe
it
was
because
i
paired
it
with
my
wifes
amazing
spaghetti
and
meatballs
or
because
i
compared
it
to
a
bottle
of
full
sail
ale
that
did
nothing
for
me
but
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
dont
mean
loved
but
liked
a
lot
the
hops
were
nicely
present
on
the
nose
and
well
balanced
with
the
nice
malt
flavor
and
decent
carbonation
i
didnt
sit
and
contemplate
the
beer
with
a
pen
and
notebook
at
hand
i
drank
it
with
my
pasta
dinner
and
enjoyed
it
the
pour
is
light
copperred
with
a
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissapated
to
a
thin
white
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
medium
hop
spice
in
the
nose
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
an
esb
to
me
the
drink
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
hops
come
in
mid
mouth
the
finish
is
a
lingering
hop
oil
to
clean
all
and
all
a
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
d
a
little
high
on
the
abv
side
for
me
to
want
to
session
but
certainly
wouldnt
mind
quaffing
more
than
one
pint
of
this
in
an
evening
at
all
good
stuff
a
nice
beer
to
have
around
lacking
complexity
but
solid
comment
i
expected
a
more
pronounced
bitter
experience
as
the
beer
warmed
the
malts
dominated
and
the
beer
became
less
bittery
and
more
malty
also
it
was
a
tad
over
creamy
for
my
taste
i
have
to
say
i
was
impressed
at
how
balanced
and
drinkable
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
was
in
perfect
harmony
and
balance
with
hops
creating
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
one
that
was
certainly
palatable
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
was
smooth
not
too
carbonated
and
clean
this
is
the
definition
of
a
sessioner
and
one
of
the
better
american
esbs
ive
had
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
okay
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
seems
to
hit
the
major
traits
of
style
without
any
pomp
and
circumstance
worth
a
repeat
buy
if
youre
looking
for
an
inexpensive
esb
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
half
of
one
of
these
i
had
trouble
making
myself
drink
that
much
of
it
d
pretty
darn
good
sessionable
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
i
cant
say
i
loved
it
but
i
also
cant
say
that
it
was
bad
i
think
it
definitely
deserves
to
be
rated
above
average
but
to
call
it
good
might
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
d
love
this
beer
when
hanging
out
with
friends
or
watching
sports
etc
not
nearly
as
complex
as
fullers
esb
but
a
good
flavor
nonetheless
this
is
a
solid
consistent
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
came
to
me
in
a
pint
looked
light
amber
with
a
thin
head
it
had
a
slight
fruit
and
malty
smell
i
enjoyed
the
taste
it
was
malty
and
a
little
bitter
after
taste
it
has
a
medium
carbonation
that
goes
down
pretty
smooth
to
me
i
think
it
had
a
great
taste
to
it
and
could
drink
it
for
some
time
but
it
does
get
a
little
bitter
a
decent
enough
beer
but
missing
any
distinction
that
might
bring
me
back
to
it
or
keep
my
interested
no
knock
on
the
beer
but
its
just
a
little
one
demensional
pours
a
twofinger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
slight
hoppy
nose
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor

the

a
ok
brew
not
the
highlight
of
the
offerings
but
and
all
around
good
beer
taste
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
a
bud
or
the
like
more
robust
but
still
very
light
esb
is
not
very
appropriate
for
what
i
had
still
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
easy
drinking
didnt
leave
a
bad
or
lingering
aftertaste
d
a
good
beer
to
kick
back
with
and
enjoy
some
pizza
with
your
boys
nothing
special
but
who
cares
overall
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
choose
given
other
nonmacro
options
i
even
let
the
beer
warm
up
as
per
the
alstrom
bros
suggestion
this
beer
did
not
compare
to
even
the
standard
bitters
that
i
have
tried
in
the
uk
an
orange
amber
the
initial
two
fingers
of
light
orange
head
fad
to
a
wispy
covering
some
retention
on
the
glass
hop
aromas
are
light
and
fruity
toasted
malts
a
bit
of
caramel
the
smooth
diacetyl
butters
up
the
smell
but
its
too
present
on
the
tongue
a
little
oily
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
i
dont
think
it
really
does
credit
to
the
style
i
dont
mind
that
its
simple
but
its
not
super
flavorful
and
i
think
theres
too
much
diacetyl
not
bad
but
nothing
special
i
wasnt
sure
id
like
a
bitter
but
a
friend
of
mine
had
been
telling
me
about
them
for
a
while
so
i
finally
broke
down
and
got
a
sixpack
of
redhook
esb
about
a
week
ago
my
nightly
beer
for
most
of
the
past
few
nights
has
been
this
it
has
a
very
nice
molten
copper
color
for
a
bottled
beer
it
has
good
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
good
not
great
but
does
give
a
pleasant
hint
of
the
hops
the
taste
is
wonderful
it
goes
down
smooth
has
an
excellent
hoppy
flavor
without
being
overly
bitter
if
you
want
to
try
a
bitter
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
one
that
is
easy
to
find
overall
not
something
ill
probably
drink
again
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
thats
good
if
theres
absolutely
nothing
else
got
this
one
on
tap
at
joe
kools
in
troy
mi
pours
a
good
looking
amber
color
with
a
nice
finger
of
whiteish
head
on
top
a
touch
of
lacing
nose
is
weak
very
light
malt
presence
but
beyond
that
not
much
not
bad
just
not
really
there
taste
is
a
little
better
although
still
fairly
mild
caramel
malt
some
light
saltiness
and
then
very
mild
hop
character
at
the
back
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
solid
carbonation
i
like
what
the
alstrom
bros
said
about
this
one
and
am
in
agreement
its
a
starter
beer
for
the
style
although
not
one
youd
really
recommend
to
a
longtime
beer
drinker
pours
a
light
honey
color
with
some
decent
carbonation
smells
good
with
roasted
malts
dominating
the
smell
tastes
good
some
maltiness
to
it
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
but
the
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
has
a
full
mouthfeel
and
has
a
good
malty
tasty
much
like
red
hooks
other
beers
good
beer
at
a
great
price
cant
go
wrong
the
beer
is
dark
gold
it
has
a
nice
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
lingers
for
a
minute
the
smell
of
hops
is
the
most
dominant
aroma
characteristic
tastes
good
a
touch
bitter
as
its
supposed
to
be
but
not
overpowering
i
like
this
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
it
agian
d
no
matter
how
many
times
ive
tried
this
beer
i
always
seem
to
be
comming
back
to
it
i
must
have
had
this
beer
on
at
least
a
dozen
different
occasions
which
is
a
big
deal
for
me
because
i
am
always
looking
for
new
beers
to
try
drinkability
not
bad
but
its
quite
a
bland
beer
i
suppose
this
could
be
a
transitional
beer
for
those
just
getting
into
craft
brew
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
seeking
out
d
for
everything
thats
there
the
taste
seems
diluted
which
offsets
the
slightly
thick
consistancy
in
a
weird
way
drinkin
one
makes
me
want
something
different
something
more
english
drinkability
i
remember
tasting
this
beer
about
10
years
ago
i
believe
it
was
called
ballard
bitter
and
thought
the
beer
was
strong
in
hops
and
alcohol
perhaps
i
was
only
a
novice
then
but
this
beer
is
incredibly
light
on
the
palate
difficult
to
believe
the
5
8
alcohol
level
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
refreshing
for
the
summer
also
i
like
the
clearly
marked
stencilled
freshness
date
via
bottle
got
minimal
head
and
lacing
flavor
more
earthy
and
also
got
a
sourish
off
flavor
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
nice
head
and
lacing
on
glass
didnt
like
this
that
much
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
it
was
served
to
cold
flavors
really
intensify
as
it
warms
very
balanced
flavor
smooth
and
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
makes
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
trying
something
other
than
bmc
not
really
much
of
an
esb
but
not
bad
either
give
me
a
fullers
or
stouts
scarlet
lady
over
this
anyday
red
hook
again
gives
a
good
macro
but
not
a
great
macro
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
mild
in
all
departments
nothing
too
special
here
just
a
generally
well
balanced
ale
d
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
while
it
was
full
of
flavor
it
felt
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
scale
its
something
i
would
come
back
to
when
i
want
to
have
more
than
a
beer
or
two
in
a
sitting
d
not
too
bad
i
had
this
before
and
was
not
impressed
not
a
bad
middle
of
the
road
beer
though
not
too
malty
not
too
hoppy
very
sessionable
it
is
my
beer
of
choice
for
any
summer
bbq
the
taste
pairs
very
nicely
with
grilled
jerk
pork
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
in
the
beer
cuts
the
spicyness
of
the
jeck
pork
without
being
to
heavy
and
filling
enjoy
ive
had
a
lot
of
this
brew
and
note
that
if
its
not
ultra
fresh
the
malt
is
uninteresting
and
the
veryimportant
toasted
note
dissapears
making
this
beer
booring
fresh
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
its
really
impressive
get
a
real
fresh
one
when
you
give
this
beer
a
go
and
while
youre
at
it
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
its
truly
worth
it
mouthfeel
is
full
and
on
par
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
high
for
me
i
ususally
give
her
a
rousing
pour
so
that
the
carbonation
doesnt
overwhelm
the
flavors
goes
well
with
food
from
wings
to
burgersanother
big
plus
one
of
the
few
paler
ales
that
can
actually
keep
me
interested
and
at
that
i
seem
to
drinking
this
beer
2x
more
often
than
many
others
i
stock
in
my
fridge
i
love
this
beer
the
only
challenge
is
finding
her
as
fresh
as
id
like
and
keeping
her
that
way
smooth
well
carbonated
bitter
alcohol
is
manageable
overall
a
decent
stab
at
an
esb
this
beer
came
out
of
the
bottle
a
very
clear
tan
color
with
good
commerciallooking
small
consistent
bubbles
head
aroma
was
very
minimal
some
sweet
maltiness
flavorwise
i
could
not
get
over
this
coppermetallic
flavor
this
beer
tasted
like
a
penny
or
like
water
that
had
snaked
through
a
bunch
of
copper
piping
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
harsh
and
unremarkable
i
was
very
not
impressed
with
this
beer
d
it
wasnt
bad
and
i
didnt
have
any
problems
drinking
it
it
certainly
wasnt
a
bad
experience
but
i
cant
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
all
that
much
either
one
was
enough
its
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
like
the
bitterness
here
as
it
isnt
overly
sweet
very
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
possibly
a
little
overcarbonated
for
the
style
i
think
but
great
otherwise
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
actually
i
have
on
many
occasions
overall
a
good
middleoftheroad
esb
tasty
and
drinkable
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinkability
nice
beer
if
you
dont
like
a
thick
malt
beer
something
to
start
off
on
the
malt
side
if
you
are
a
hop
head
enjoyed
this
beer
i
understand
why
this
is
the
flagship
of
the
company
drinkability
not
the
best
esb
but
well
worth
trying
this
is
a
lot
of
peoples
1st
esb
and
even
some
peoples
1st
real
beer
i
recently
picked
up
this
beer
at
a
local
target
of
all
places
it
has
a
wonderful
amber
color
the
head
is
great
and
hung
around
for
a
very
long
time
i
dont
know
why
they
call
this
esb
there
is
little
to
no
bitterness
it
has
a
malty
flavor
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
i
drank
this
beer
with
some
mild
cheddar
i
picked
up
from
the
kroger
deli
what
a
great
combo
the
cheese
really
brings
out
the
flavor
in
the
beer
this
could
be
the
gateway
esb
i
now
want
to
try
others
a
swig
reveals
my
worst
fears
founded
about
the
carbonation
with
it
too
active
up
front
particularly
the
aftertaste
is
marred
by
a
metallic
tint
otherwise
you
have
a
par
for
the
course
esb
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
moderate
hopping
and
a
nice
smooth
texture
drinkable
but
far
from
essential
served
in
standard
pint
glass
clear
golden
reddish
color
with
a
white
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
this
strings
of
lace
slightly
fruity
aroma
with
lots
of
citrus
hops
a
bit
of
caramel
also
present
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
flavor
malt
sweetness
combined
with
hop
bitterness
grapefruit
in
the
taste
with
sharp
bite
in
the
finish
very
nice
sessional
esb
drinkability
not
the
best
esb
i
have
sampled
but
a
nice
attempt
i
would
definitely
order
this
one
in
a
barrestaurant
and
occasionally
pick
up
a
sixer
from
the
package
store
a
good
entry
beer
into
the
style
but
it
is
a
fairly
easy
style
to
enjoy
with
a
short
learning
curve
so
dont
dwell
on
this
offering
too
long
if
you
are
going
to
dwell
on
an
esb
i
suggest
fullers
i
got
a
free
sample
from
an
ab
rep
friend
so
im
pretty
happy
i
didnt
spend
any
ching
on
this
brew
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
was
reminiscent
of
stale
bread
with
some
faint
fruit
odors
as
well
the
taste
is
a
defined
improvement
on
the
smell
sweet
light
fruit
malts
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
hop
backing
not
spectacular
in
any
way
but
a
wellflavored
balanced
brew
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
nice
fine
carbonation
this
is
actually
quite
drinkable
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
did
not
like
it
all
but
i
find
it
pretty
tasty
now
pours
orange
amber
color
with
a
large
egg
shell
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
covering
on
the
beer
and
moderate

very
slight
buttery
aroma
with
some
toasted
malt
and
some
caramel
present
sweet
malty
caramel
just
covering
the
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
balanced
with
good
carbonation
maybe
not
the
best
but
a
good
session
beer
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
of
weak
amber
malts
with
a
slight
hop
backbone
the
taste
was
decently
balanced
just
not
that
far
above
average
the
beer
is
a
good
textbook
example
of
the
style
its
just
not
anything
spectacular
it
is
enjoyable
for
the
price
if
your
in
a
pinch
or
if
the
place
your
at
doesnt
have
anything
better
appearance
is
a
clear
light
copper
colored
hue
with
a
generous
head
lacing
is
minimal
to

throughout
tasting
smell
is
of
weak
hops
citrusy
with
an
overpowering
scent
of
buttervanilla
that
comes
from
the
malt
taste
is
quite
smooth
with
a
slight
hop
bite
malt
seems
to
be
most
present
with
this
esb
tastes
of
vanillacaramel
is
present
as
well
carbonation
is
quite
powerful
which
seems
to
take
away
from
the
beer
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unpleasant
as
well
i
normally
enjoy
esbs
but
red
hook
is
definitely
lacking
on
this
one
from
a
bottle
purchased
at
the
local
safeway
in
eureka
this
poured
an
attractive
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
and
left
decent
lacing
nose
is
mostly
hops
with
some
citrus
mouthfeel
clean
and
crisp
and
favor
is
malts
and
a
nice
bitter
hops
finish
is
just
about
right
for
a
bitter
with
just
the
correct
amount
of
bite
this
is
a
great
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
should
please
people
who
like
brews
to
be
uncomplicated
poured
pale
amber
with
an
inch
of
grainy
white
listless
head
aroma
is
mild
with
a
little
hops
and
malt
taste
is
also
pretty
mild
i
would
call
this
a
light
pale
ale
not
an
esb
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
either
a
nice
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
but
its
a
mild
pale
ale
for
a
taste
of
sublime
esb
try
fullers
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
setting
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
a
bright
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
leaving
very
little
lace
the
aroma
is
slight
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
similar
pretty
one
dimensional
with
the
toasted
malt
although
some
hop
bitterness
and
lots
of
minerals
on
the
finish
leaving
an
almost
lagerish
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
as
well
there
was
nothing
about
this
beer
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
another
although
it
wasnt
particularly
bad
just
not
that
good
poured
bottle
into
stien
the
color
was
a
nice
copper
tone
that
looked
very
tasty
there
was
about
one
finger
width
of
head
the
disappeared
in
about
4560
sec
the
smell
was
nice
and
inticed
my
tase
buds
the
first
sip
went
down
smooth
i
recommend
and
would
buy
again
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
pours
out
a
tangerine
tinted
honey
color
with
a
14
head
that
is
fed
by
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
within
the
body
of
the
beer
stringy
lacing
nose
is
extremely
toasty
with
a
kick
of
citrus
and
herbs
a
little
medicinal
flavor
starts
off
with
a
metallic
twang
mixed
with
toasted
malt
and
sickly
sweetness
hops
dont
offer
so
much
in
the
area
of
flavors
aside
from
a
muddy
bitterness
ends
medicinal
and
cloying
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
prickly
all
at
once
ill
finish
this
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite

and
no
lacing
to
be
seen
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
faitly
simple
and
doesnt
quite
indicate
what
is
to
come
in
the
taste
taste
is
initially
of
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
spices
bittering
slightly
piney
hops
quickly
make
their
presence
felt

body
and
a
good
amount

is
good

relatively
simple
esb
but
easy
to
drink
pours
to
a
color
of
honey
with
decent
carbonation
one
solid
inch
of
head
is
a
even
tan
color
that
leaves
a
slight
lace
nose
is
soft
and
subtle
but
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
nuttiness
slightly
bitter
as
it
first
touches
the
tongue
but
mellows
quickly
as
the
palate
develops
even
yeilds
a
bit
of
soft
sweetness
this
is
a
testament
to
how
tastes
do
change
i
can
remember
not
liking
this
one
many
years
ago
before
i
was
an
advocate
mellow
mineral
feel
on
the
mouth
not
hugely
complex
but
easy
to
drink
rather
potent
for
the
sytle
of
beer
but
the
after
taste
is
very
dry
to
just
make
you
drink
more
you
clever
brewers
some
of
the
flavor
is
missing
in
this
one
because
of
a
filtering
process
still
its
a
decent
esb
and
one
worth
trying
i
got
this
pint
ontap
at
malones
restraunt
in
old
boston
lexington
virginia
it
poured
a
pretty
very
light
brown
color
there
was
about
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
head
that
produced
very
thin
lacing
the
retention
wa
also
fast
the
smell
was
very
bitter
and
had
a
great
hoppy
blend
the
taste
was
also
bitter
but
not
as
well
blended
as
the
smell
a
solid
esb
d
yes
and
i
think
thats
the
whole
point
this
isnt
a
sipping
beer
its
easy
to
drink
though
not
unique
enough
where
id
ever
be
in
the
mood
for
this
and
only
this
beer
still
its
widely
available
and
there
have
been
more
than
a
few
times
when
ive
found
myself
in
a
smalltown
hotel
where
the
only
gas
station
open
late
at
night
had
nothing
good
in
the
cooler
except
this
is
often
the
best
thing
on
tap
at
restaurants
a
good
crisp
uncomplicated
ale
this
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
is
everybit
as
appropriate
in
the
middle
of
summer
or
the
dead
of
winter
or
anytime
in
between
marriage
of
all
components
worked
quite
well
giving
this
standard
a
good
drinkability
d
not
great
but
not
bad
a
solid
choice
if
pressed
for
time
a
dense
head
formed
about
1
5
inches
after
the
pour
which
was
quite
pleasing
the
beer
was
an
orangebrown
color
and
looked
beautiful
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
caramel
notes
were
abundant
with
a
slight
floral
background
the
beer
has
simple
malt
characteristics
with
good
mouthfeel
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
comes
through
with
the
first
sip
and
a
slight
bitterness
finishes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
like
all
redhook
beers
drinkability
i
was
hoping
to
still
find
this
beer
which
had
impressed
me
so
much
a
couple
of
years
ago
at
least
moderately
tasty
but
this
failed
to
do
much
of
anything
for
me
it
led
me
in
the
right
direction
and
for
that
it
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
redhook
esb
was
a
golden
orange
color
with
very
good
clarity
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
but
a
little
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
was
there
the
taste
was
lightly
bitter
with
some
crystal
malt
and
english
hops
the
finish
was
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
it
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
a
pretty
simple
and
easy
drinking
bitter
that
would
work
well
as
a
session
beer
i
cannot
recall
details
from
the
bottles
i
had
a
year
or
so
ago
but
this
is
definitely
better
than
the
bottle
version
a
decent
beer
somewhat
lackluster
but
certainly
alright
some
caramel
malt
in
the
beginning
but
bitterness
is
a
little
too
dry
and
some
metallic
taste
is
present
i
thought
at
first
this
beer
would
shine
in
its
drinkability
but
i
didnt
seem
to
get
through
it
that
quickly
the
taste
left
on
the
palate
is
a
bit
unsettling
and
doesnt
provoke
immediate
revisitation
could
be
a
mediator
for
those
who
only
drink
macros
cheers
i
will
say
this
if
they
would
say
its
an
amber
ale
it
would
pass
but
an
esb
poor
attempt
a
slightly
redish
golden
amber
with
a
creamy
smooth
head
there
is
a
slight
but
noticeable
hops
aroma
the
ale
has
a
taste
of
hops
and
a
full
bodied
flavor
this
is
a
good
flavorful
beer
a
potential
gateway
beer
if
you
are
trying
to
convince
some
friends
to
move
beyond
pilsners
i
had
this
beer
previosuly
with
a
basic
plate
of
pasta
and
marinara
sauce
and
ive
been
recommending
as
a
good
italian
food
beer
ever
since
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
esb
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
tasted
reasonably
priced
and
one
of
redhooks
better
offerings
i
personally
liked
it
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
searching
for
the
flavor
was
right
where
i
thought
it
would
be
hops
were
absolutly
the
overall
taste
with
a
nutty
background
that
was
trying
its
best
to
show
that
it
was
there
the
mouthfeel
was
what
got
me
to
not
jump
up
and
down
it
was
lacking
structure
watery
thats
what
i
meant
and
almost
no
aroma
from
the
little
head
that
was
there
not
awful
but
not
impressed
very
drinkable
with
a
lighter
meal
like
baked
chicken
but
not
good
for
grills
or
pastas
da
not
too
bad
at
all
not
bad
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
not
offensive
and
easy
going
with
a
good
balance
this
beer
is
a
translucent
light
brown
color
maintains
a
small
thin
head
and
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
fairly
mild
and
balanced
mildly
sweet
malts
are
countered
with
equally
mil
hops
nothing
overwhelms
carbonation
is
low
and
its
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
maybe
a
tad
sour
on
the
finishthis
is
another
workmanlike
brew
from
redhook
decent
for
the
style
but
nothing
special
enjoy
this
one
with
a
meal
drinkability
you
could
slamem
back
but
i
doubt
you
would
really
care
for
the
taste
pours
a
clear
amber
coppery
color
with
a
sticky
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
a
fair
layer
of
hops
as
well
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
good
just
a
little
too
faint
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
esb
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
the
only
gripe
i
have
with
it
is
that
it
is
just
too
conservative
in
the
flavor
department
overall
a
pleasant
esb
it
was
great
to
be
with
friends
for
a
season
opener
bengals
game
but
my
beer
left
me
wanting
more
this
one
poured
a
very
golden
light
amber
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
that
surprisingly
left
a
thin
ring
of
spotty
and
fine
lacing
the
beers
nose
was
kind
of
tame
and
uneventful
and
the
flavor
was
a
balanced
light
hoppiness
with
a
malt
character
that
transitioned
to
a
iced
tea
like
character
as
it
slid
across
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
hindered
by
my
own
personal
lack
of
interest
in
this
particular
beer
i
like
this
style
but
better
examples
of
it
exist
get
my
buzz
on
n
overall
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
not
robust
enough
to
take
this
beer
seriously
perhaps
this
would
make
a
crossover
beer
for
a
macro
drinker
thumbs
up
d
not
the
best
esb
so
id
pass
on
it
again
thank
you
redhook
for
making
something
really
tasty
the
subliminal
messages
on
the
labels
are
fun
too
a
dissapointing
esb
will
avoid
in
the
future
good
taste
but
a
little
bitter
in
the
end
chocolate
meets
bitter
meets
red
amber
lager
with
stronger
alcohol
finish
needs
to
be
cold
and
fresh
to
be
acceptable
but
when
it
is
its
above
average
for
its
class
missing
somethinggets
a
little
overwhelming
if
not
drank
before
temp
change
or
flattening
d
i
could
drink
this
in
session
not
for
those
in
search
of
excitement
but
great
for
someone
happy
to
find
a
good
consistent
drinkable
pleasure
had
with
italian
subs
juicy
burgers
fish
all
sorts
of
things
and
it
seems
to
go
well
with
all
d
nothing
to
say
wow
about
however
a
pleasing
beer
flavors
and
aromas
seem
subdued
for
the
style
but
the
result
is
style
a
good
tasting
a
drinkable
beer
have
had
it
both
from
the
bottle
and
ontap
and
recommend
the
ontap
version
drinkability
given
its
medium
body
and
crisp
taste
i
could
drink
several
of
these
no
problem
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
and
would
also
be
paired
well
with
a
spicy
food
i
may
think
about
picking
this
up
again
d
good
i
enjoyed
this
it
is
far
from
great
but
it
is
pleasant
its
bitter
taste
makes
it
excellent
for
countless
food
pairings
easy
to
session
as
well
ive
had
it
before
and
i
will
probably
have
it
again
largely
due
to
availability

don
the
edge
of
being

sweet

a
very
good

can
drink
these

a
good

if
you
can
get
someone
to
drive
you

with
the

still
good

esb
tastes
a
lot
like
a
sierra

pale
ale
im
wonder
if
they
get
the
same
batch
of
hops
because
it
is
amazingly
similar
in
bitterness
and
taste
pours
an

red
color
with
an

is
among
the
thickest
ive

element

me
very
impressed

the

the

very
edgy

be
noble

ill
say
it
again
a

a

myself

it
gets
its

it
kicks

cant

this

just
what

red
hook
esbs
only
major
drawback
was
the
neutral
aroma
otherwise
it
is
a
pretty
good
ale
im
not
a
big
bitter
fan
so
i
subtracted
on
drinkability
hop
heads
may
think
the
bitterness
is
too
subdued
for
an
esb
and
i
cant
let
the
review
go
without
stating
that
red
hook
has
one
of
the
best
microbrew
websites
that
ive
seen
cheesy
sure
but
take
a
look
at
the
details
of
their
beers
and
you
can
find
out
all
kinds
of
good
stuff
from
what
malts
and
hops
they
use
to
original
gravity
ibus
carbs
and
even
calories
per
12oz
serving
most
unusual
but
kudos
to
red
hook
for
not
hiding
the
facts
redhook
esb
is
overall
an
average
representation
of
the
style
its
a
pretty
damn
good
brew
and
worth
a
try
i
thought
i
might
enjoy
this
more
but
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
an
average
beer
with
not
much
aroma
or
appearance
its
flavor
and
price
are
such
that
i
could
see
having
several
at
a
party
or
at
the
lake
but
not
really
decent
enough
to
enjoy
sipping
and
truly
savoring
probably
best
looked
at
as
a
gateway
esb
for
people
just
starting
to
discover
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
not
filling
at
all
perfect
for
this
summer
heat
im
glad
i
came
back
to
this
one
after
about
a
year
of
not
having
it
overall
its
an
okay
beer
but
not
very
compelling
has
some
interesting
elements
to
it
which
make
it
worth
trying
not
particularly
my
style
in
general
but
i
wouldnt
be
averse
to
having
this
again
especially
with
friends
not
bad
but
not
great
either
i
definitely
prefer
this
over
any
macro
good
to
wash
down
pizza
or
what
have
you
recommended
for
mindless
quaffing
but
dont
expect
too
much
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
hops
are
almost
more
of
a
spice
an
accent
though
not
the
only
featured
predominant
flavor
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
an
oilybuttery
slipperyness
smoothness
that
makes
it
drink
faster
than
it
should
with
its
bitterness
level
there
is
yet
more
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
and
it
lingers
almost
as
long
as
the
heavy
curtain
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
all
in
all
this
is
a
clean
crisp
and
wellbrewed
beer
beer
is
a
very
clear
light
amber
color
has
a
weak
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
has
a
malty
smell
the
kind
of
malty
smell
you
get
from
a
shake
slight
hint
of
citrus
very
little
hop
aroma
tastes
thicker
than
i
expected
it
to
very
malty
with
a
bitter
after
taste
a
bit
over
carbonated
i
think
overall
its
a
decent
beer
not
too
impressed
but
its
my
first
esb
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
think
after
a
another
one
or
two
it
may
start
growing
on
me
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
biege
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
has
some
hints
of
caramel
but
is
mostly
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
the
flavor
is
also
initially
sweet
with
caramel
malt
flavors
followed
by
a
floral
and
mineraly
hops
flavor
some
toasted
bread
and
some
fruity
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
drinkability
is
good
a
descent
esb
pales
in
comparisson
to
fullers
but
like
half
the
price
seemed
a
bit
similar
to
their
ipa
not
great
not
horrible
the
willamette
tettnang
hops
gave
it
an
interesting
bittering
character
although
im
not
sure
i
liked
it
that
much
you
do
get
some
malt
up
from
but
the
hop
bitterness
really
overshadowed
any
malt
character
on
the
plus
side
this
doesnt
have
a
harsh
feel
on
the
tongue
in
fact
it
is
rather
gentle
and
pleasing
drinkable
but
why
bother
at
least
it
was
cheap
d
where
is
the
buttery
flavor
that
this
beer
once
had
what
a
shame
musings
bought
this
stuff
dirt
cheap
at
costco
its
not
a
total
failure
but
has
major
misgivings
and
some
might
be
downright
scared
by
the
taste
the
poor
finish
is
hardly
enough
to
ruin
the
flavor
but
it
doesnt
help
it
i
really
dont
know
what
to
expect
from
a
good
esb
since
the
majority
of
the
authentic
ones
imported
here
from
the
uk
taste
either
stale
or
pasteurized
by
the
time
i
get
to
drinking
them
and
since
the
majority
of
the
ones
made
in
the
usa
are
usually
just
bland
apas
reedhook
seems
to
capture
what
ive
been
led
to
believe
is
a
solid
esb
flavorful
with
a
definite
hop
character
but
not
so
bitter
as
to
inhibit
pounding
at
5
7
this
is
a
little
overthetop
for
a
true
session
beer
but
nonetheless
it
is
rather
easily
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
bringing
a
couple
6packs
along
to
a
party
when
i
dont
feel
like
drinking
the
macro
swill
they
have
there
its
too
sweet
to
be
a
good
example
of
this
style
while
it
wasnt
terrible
nothing
is
telling
me
to
grab
another
a
session
beer
for
the
masses
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
and
not
get
bored
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
raw
quality
to
it
its
a
great
hoppy
beer
but
also
very
drinkable
for
any
occasion
it
would
be
good
with
some
hot
wings
to
cut
through
the
spice
but
not
overwhelm
the
meal
redhook
esb
is
a
delightful
brew
pouring
a
rich
reddishgold
color
with
a
generous
foamy
head
aromas
of
whoppers
you
know
those
malted
milk
balls
asends
from
the
glass
with
a
soft
hop
binding
wrapped
tightly
around
it
malty
and
moderately
rich
this
brew
drinks
very
well
as
the
balance
of
the
slightly
roasted
malt
and
the
ample
hops
make
for
uninhibited
quaffing
slightly
dry
and
crisp
this
esb
is
user
friendly
and
insistent
on
turning
this
tasting
into
a
session
perhaps
lacking
some
of
the
hardware
of
the
finest
british
examples
this
brew
deserves
applause
for
what
it
is
a
truly
decent
version
of
the
real
mccoy
overall
a
nice
simple
session
beer
not

the
aroma
along
with
a
medium
body
that
is
slightly
drying
and
a
taste
that
reflects
the
aroma
leaving
a
medium
bitterness
and
finish
its
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
probably
good
for
sessions
but
doesnt
seem
too
complex
and
might
have
lost
some
of
its
bitterness
since
the
last
time
ive
tried
it
including
both
bottled
and
ontap
maybe
they
changed
the
recipe
or
maybe
the
nh
brewery
isnt
up
to
par
with
the
washington
one
who
knows
a
good
balanced
and
tasty
beer
looks
refreshing
coming
out
of
the
bottle
but
gives
very
complex
flavors
in
the
smell
and
taste
disappointing
on
tap
didnt
finish
my
pint
by
the
time
the
meal
was
done
and
didnt
hang
around
afterwards
to
finish
it
either
it
had
a
nice
orangey
golden
look
to
it
with
a
small
white
head
had
a
decent
orange
scent
and
the
taste
was
citrusyorangey
as
well
its
not
too
strong
a
taste
sometimes
these
esbs
can
get
too
fruity
for
me
but
these
one
wasnt
overwhelming
in
that
regard
this
would
be
an
easy
sunny
day
drinker
this
beer
poured
a
light
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
and
leaves
a
little
lace
the
smell
is
all
pale
malts
the
taste
also
hits
you
with
the
malts
and
comes
acorss
very
sweet
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
the
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
with
the
thickness
and
the
carbonation
overall
not
too
drinkable
i
am
really
not
crazy
about
the
sweetness
tastes
of
fruity
biscuity
malt
low
level
herbal
hops
that
build
as
you
drink
mouth
is
lightly
sticky
pretty
easy
drinker
not
bad
hits
the
spot
drinkability
a
few
sips
and
the
sweetness
seems
to
overpower
me
a
bit
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
1
serving
at
a
time
im
new
to
the
style
but
it
just
seemed
a
little
extreme
to
me
not
a
bad
american
esb
but
i
like
the
british
ones
ive
had
much
better
also
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
redhook
beers
ive
tried
but
here
in
houston
its
by
far
the
easiest
to
find
d
superb
a
true
session
beer
and
at
5
77
abv
it
will
ensure
a
good
time
i
would
drink
this
until
i
couldnt
see
and
my
liver
begged
me
to
take
a
break
in
my
younger
years
read
yesterday
feels
a
little
heavy
in
the
mouth
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
for
the
metallic
taste
this
is
a
good
tasty
thirst
quencher
simple
and
undemanding
poured
a
nice
dark
gold
the
creamy
white
head
left
some
decent
lacing
aroma
wise
this
one
has
a
nicely
balanced
toasty
malt
and
spicy
hop
aroma
taste
is
a
spicy
mix
of
pine
and
citrus
with
a
toastynutty
backdrop
light
bodied
smooth
and
very
drinkable
opinion
this
beer
was
a
bit
more
unusual
for
me
than
most
to
nail
down
about
the
only
thing
that
i
can
figure
is
that
there
is
a
lot
of
flavoring
hops
here
to
give
the
impression
of
an
esb
while
the
bittering
hops
are
lessened
to
accentuate
the
alcohol
and
malt
other
than
this
about
the
only
time
i
have
drunk
this
beer
is
at
a
renaissance
festival
judging
from
my
impression
now
it
is
better
than
most
of
the
rotgut
beers
they
have
there
but
this
isnt
one
that
i
will
be
drinking
outside
of
the
2030
a
ticket
confines
da
high
this
is
a
perfect
session
ale
for
this
brewery
you
cant
expect
anything
over
the
top
but
i
think
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
their
selections
a
very
delectable
beer
very
creamy
buttery
mouthfeel
slight
butterscotch
edge
with
intense
malt
flavors
extremely
smooth
extremely
drinkable
enjoyable
every
day
type
of
beer
ordered
a
60
minutes
and
the
bar
wench
as
she
calls
herself
pours
me
this
instead
i
wouldnt
have
ordered
it
on
purpose
but
now
that
i
have
had
it
i
would
do
so
by
choice
nice
light
amber
color
and
large
white
head
and
some
lacing
in
the
glass
smells
slight
caramel
malt
with
a
metallic
twist
in
with
a
hop
citrus
splash
the
taste
is
not
too
metallic
but
there
is
more
in
here
than
i
care
for
i
am
guessing
to
help
with
the
dryness
still
it
is
a
good
solid
esb
all
way
round
not
something
to
crave
but
something
to
be
enjoyed
for
sure
d
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
id
drink
this
again
but
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
the
overall
bitter
flavor
however
would
get
to
me
after
two
or
three
oelergud
plenty
of
better
esbs
to
choose
from
this
one
is
getting
the
hook
pun
intended
as
far
as
esbs
go
this
one
was
a
little
weak
the
color
was
a
nice
translucent
red
the
smell
was
fruity
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
hoppy
spiced
beer
the
beer
seemed
fine
but
started
to
turn
a
bit
sour
as
it
warmed
i
could
drink
these
again
not
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
but
overall
a
good
brew
this
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
into
the
world
of
craft
beers
its
an
ale
that
is
safe
enough
for
a
drinker
of
macros
looking
to
expand
a
little
something
that
i
would
only
choose
again
if
i
didnt
want
to
get
too
fancy
or
wanted
something
during
the
summer
months
i
love
winterhook
but
the
other
redhook
brews
that
ive
tried
have
been
pedestrian
at
best
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
good
little
esb
this
evening
unfortunately
i
didnt
find
one
inside
this
bottle
good
mouthfeel
kind
of
marshmellowy
with
a
clean
light
alcohol
finish
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
good
for
sessions
as
well
as
a
crowd
pleaser
definitely
worth
your
while
pours
a
very
solid
copper
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
light
coating
of
white
head
sits
atop
with
just
a
few
rogue
bubbles
boiling
up
from
the
bottom
the
nose
is
light
orange
citrusy
light
caramel
light
toastyness
with
a
faint
peppery
hop
character
nothing
seems
to
want
to
take
the
lead
in
the
aroma
flavor
shows
a
moderate
toasty
bread
quality
on
the
start
moving
to
a
light
caramel
moderate
citrusy
orange
hop
finishing
again
with
the
toastyness
and
a
very
mild
bitter
also
on
the
finish
the
hopping
gives
this
one
a
slight
metallic
tinge
that
im
not
enjoying
all
that
much
the
feel
is
on
the
light
end
of
moderate
with
a
light
carbonaiton
id
like
to
see
a
touch
more
body
and
a
touch
more
carbonation
its
not
as
lively
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
overall
this
one
isnt
bad
but
its
not
doing
anything
to
make
a
major
impression
for
me
the
metallic
finish
really
puts
me
off
d
again
would
be
better
with
food
but
otherwise
drinkable
not
my
favorite
esb
but
tasty
enough
would
buy
again
dgood
flavor
but
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
after
i
finish
the
6
pack
i
bought
one
of
the
driest
beers
that
i
have
had
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
one
of
my
lowbrow
favorites
drinkability
a
little
too
thick
strong
to
have
too
many
of
maybe
a
couple
the
butterscotch
flavor
became
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
started
to
warm
and
left
imprints
even
after
i
was
done
with
the
beer
pours
a
crystalclear
reddishorange
hue
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
surprisingly
considering
the
hoppedup
nature
of
most
redhook
brews
the
taste
however
is
where
the
hops
come
into
play
theres
a
mild
initial
sweetness
followed
by
grassy
woody
earthy
tannins
from
the
hops
this
one
is
overly
bitter
for
the
style
to
me
and
just
way
offbalance
leathery
on
my
palate
and
just
not
enjoyable
to
me
especially
when
i
think
of
other
esbs
i
truly
enjoy
overall
i
think
i
prefer
this
on
tap
i
used
to
not
get
this
much
because
of
their
ties
with
anheiserbush
but
their
blackhook
and
winterhook
won
me
over
plus
its
good
so
why
not
buy
it
presented
in
a
redhook
pint
a
34
beige
head
over
the
dark
golden
brew
with
excellent
lacing
for
such
a
nice
brew
especially
since
the
head
itself
wasnt
particularly
longlived
aroma
is
more
or
less
generic
pale
malts
and
bitterness
taste
is
quick
pale
grains
sweetness
followed
and
overcome
by
somewhat
nondescript
but
strong
hops
bitterness
which
carry
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
more
approachable
but
drinkability
was
still
pretty
good
not
a
bad
brew
and
against
competition
of
amber
bock
bud
bud
light
a
winner
hands
down
for
the
flavors
i
got
that
spoiled
an
otherwise
decent
offering
lets
just
hope
i
got
an
old
batch
drinkability
run
of
the
mill
esb
but
still
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
many
others
i
like
better
than
this
one
though
pours
a
dark
blonde
and
leaves
a
2in
white
head
with
giant
bubbles
in
it
the
aroma
is
sour
musty
like
a
wet
blanket
there
is
no
trace
of
hops
or
sweetness
initally
the
taste
is
pale
very
weak
and
watery
but
strong
in
a
sourness
aspect
that
isnt
pleasing
as
i
let
this
beer
warm
up
some
i
smell
a
little
sweetness
some
honey
and
the
taste
begins
to
strengthen
a
bit
with
some
toasty
wheat
notes
but
not
much
the
taste
still
finishes
watery
a
very
pour
offering
from
redhook
note
the
bottle
has
been
redesigned
since
the
ba
picture
was
taken
its
a
little
classier
looking
bottle
and
label
these
days
but
i
hear
the
beer
might
have
been
better
some
years
ago
all
in
all
this
is
a
beer
i
could
have
2
of
but
thats
it
if
im
stuck
in
macroland
thisll
do
pours
a
nice
copper
color
out
of
a
twelve
ounce
longneck
bottle
with
the
newer
packaging
the
label
says
chill
above
esb
and
i
dont
think
thats
a
serving
suggestion
but
an
attempt
to
be
hip
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
nicely
balanced
ale
that
i
could
drink
all
night
doesnt
really
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
good
solid
quaffing
beer
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
especially
after
youve
had
a
couple
already
to
get
started
i
was
reasonably
impressed
its
not
earthshattering
and
im
not
sure
how
well
it
fits
into
the
esb
category
but
its
worth
a
try
this
beer
was
a
pretty
copper
color
with
a
very
small
head
it
had
a
subtle
sweet
odor
to
it
but
really
didnt
have
much
of
a
smell
there
was
a
vague
sweet
taste
with
a
little
hoppiness
the
hops
tended
to
linger
so
the
beer
tasted
bitter
to
me
it
was
mildly
carbonated
altogether
an
uninspiring
esb
sorry
the
taste
is
a
hoppy
sweet
beginning
that
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
with
some
bitter
aftertones
and
a
more
bitter
than
sweet
finish
carbonation
is
good
not
too
much
nor
too
little
this
ale
would
be
preferrred
by
the
european
drinker
who
prefers
more
bitter
finish
at
the
start
the
finish
of
this
beer
seemed
too
bitter
for
me
but
i
think
it
may
grow
on
me
this
poured
a
nice
redgold
with
maybe
a
finger
of
head
that
lasted
maybe
a
third
of
the
way
through
the
glass
very
attractive
i
thought
smell
was
ok
but
not
very
strong
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
without
much
hops
taste
was
pretty
good
sweet
and
slightly
malty
with
floral
maybe
fruity
hops
its
hard
to
get
more
specific
than
that
im
not
really
sure
what
kind
of
friut
the
hops
suggest
maybe
a
green
apples
very
vaguely
though
the
sweet
aspect
definately
tasted
like
honey
the
finish
and
only
the
finish
is
bitter
that
bitterness
does
linger
but
its
not
sharp
and
its
balanced
by
the
sweetness
which
lingers
as
well
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
first
sip
is
as
good
as
the
last
better
actually
i
thought
the
head
tasted
a
little
wierd
the
reason
why
i
rated
it
only
a
little
above
average
in
this
area
is
beause
its
kind
of
high
on
alcohol
and
i
think
the
otherwise
easy
drinking
nature
of
this
beer
could
ambush
you
by
all
means
if
you
have
a
driver
and
dont
have
to
get
up
in
the
morning
then
drink
up
but
otherwise
i
reccomend
switching
to
something
else
after
one
to
avoid
adverse
consequences
but
alcohol
content
aside
this
was
definately
a
good
beer
sort
of
like
an
ale
version
of
killians
oh
since
this
is
the
first
beer
labeled
esb
that
ive
ever
had
and
its
an
american
craft
type
brew
i
have
no
idea
how
well
this
fits
the
style
i
can
tell
you
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
no
clue
if
fans
of
esb
will
like
it
anyway
if
youre
just
looking
for
something
a
little
different
on
a
night
out
with
your
friends
this
is
definately
worth
a
shot
all
in
all
an
easy
beer
to
drink
in
fact
it
drank
like
a
flavorful
mass
produced
american
lager
and
with
that
ease
and
the
5
8
alcohol
content
i
can
see
this
as
being
a
beer
that
would
get
me
in
trouble
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
for
a
esb
but
definetly
dynamic
pours
a
clear
medium
brownishamber
with
a
small
offwhite
frothy
head
with
good
retention
the
smell
is
moderately
malty
with
light
hops
light
bread
some
caramel
and
herbs
and
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
the
taste
is
more
like
what
i
expect
from
an
esb
much
larger
herbal
hop
presence
and
a
moderately
bitter
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
soft
carbonation
slightly
above
average
as
far
as
esbs
go
but
nothing
special
upon
tasting
i
realise
that
there
is
a
subtle
bitterness
underlying
the
rather
pleasant
malty
flavour
to
be
a
good
esb
the
hops
would
have
to
have
much
more
impact
this
is
passable
but
ultimately
rather
humdrum
there
is
a
slightly
creamy
finish
even
though
i
generally
go
for
more
robust
brews
i
always
end
up
having
this
one
at
least
a
couple
times
a
year
next
to
anchor
steam
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
session
beers
out
there
highly
recommended
i
will
admit
that
i
bought
this
beer
because
the
price
was
right
they
were
having
a
sale
sixer
for
5
it
surprised
me
though
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
have
to
use
as
a
springboard
into
more
hoppy
beers
the
bitterness
is
nice
the
malt
is
enjoyable
it
almost
reminds
me
of
an
ale
or
maybe
even
a
cider
all
around
a
good
beer
not
great
but
a
good
one
to
comeback
to
every
now
and
then
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
ith
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
bottle
is
a
departure
for
redhook
which
until
recently
had
employed
a
thin
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
the
new
bottle
style
is
eminently
suited
for
bottling
homebrewed
beer
this
was
one
of
the
first
micros
ive
ever
had
back
in
ca
around
1996
then
it
was
in
the
smallerrounder
bottle
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
color
nice
carbonation
small
head
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
throughout
scents
of
hops
malt
bananna
the
taste
is
bitter
sweet
but
theres
a
flatness
that
i
dont
remember
from
about
the
last
time
i
had
it
maybe
2
years
ago
from
a
liquor
store
in
sliverthorne
co
medium
body
still
very
drinkable
but
its
not
the
same
as
it
use
to
be
not
sure
if
i
will
buy
it
again
drinkability

just
better
than
average

maybe
a
little
better
on
cask
this
beer
should
be
dry
hopped
redhook
could
stand
to
be
less
conservative
on
this
solid
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
esb
that
i
would
have
again
it
is
the
color
of
tarnished
but
not
oxidized
brass
and
has
a
small
white
head
made
of
miniscule
bubbles
that
stick
alright
to
the
side
actually
rather
nice
looking
the
smell
is
not
as
pleasant
caramels
with
hints
of
sour
lemon
lots
of
chewy
malt
flavor
but
pretty
one
dimensional
hop
finish
is
biting
rather
than
bettering
a
bit
sharp
in
the
mouth
and
it
leaves
a
metallic
aftertaste
but
carbionated
alright
i
think
i
am
being
a
bit
hard
but
i
am
really
disappointed
because
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
previously
copper
in
color
decent
sized
head
creamy
and
lasting
good
hoppiness
about
it
finish
is
sweet
and
bitter
good
beer
a
floral
scent
and
somewhat
citrus
with
a
decent
bitter
bite
on
the
hops
but
not
extra
bitter
maybe
a
little
spice
in
the
mix
it
definately
finishes
dry
i
wouldnt
kick
this
beer
out
of
bed
im
giving
it
a
three
for
drinkability
because
i
like
it
just
fine
will
finish
this
one
with
no
problems
but
dont
find
myself
really
wanting
another
anytime
soon
if
i
find
it
on
sale
maybe
pours
a
very
clear
red
amber
the
dense
two
finger
head
shows
good
retention
but
very
weak
lacing
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
cascade
hops
and
amber
malts
with
a
touch
of
molasses
soft
caramel
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
sharp
but
balanced
hop
bite
dry
and
earthy
hop
aftertaste
the
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
keep
the
mouthfeel
smooth
while
the
ratio
of
sweet
malt
to
bitter
hops
puts
the
finish
somewhere
between
dry
and
residual
but
easily
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
good
amber
color
with
about
one
finger
of
white
head
i
really
like
the
new
bottle
design
with
the
split
label
and
the
design
in
the
glass
between
the
2
halves
of
the
label
very
nice
it
smells
nice
and
sweet
and
a
bit
hoppy
as
well
it
tastes
somewhat
sweet
at
first
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
a
little
thin
but
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
it
is
quite
easy
to
find
and
not
terribly
expensive
there
are
better
esbs
but
i
can
always
find
this
one
for
the
price
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
revisit
this
but
nevertheless
it
was
pleasant
this
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
whitetannish
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
as
hell
and
sweet
the
taste
is
quite
citrusy
that
includes
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
mouthgeel
is
moderate
yet
creamy
fairly
drinkably
too
yes
i
will
have
to
say
this
is
the
only
beer
ab
will
ever
get
my
money
from
anymore
and
folks
this
is
a
good
one
pours
a
rich
amber
color
smells
like
a
true
esb
microbrew
very
floral
laces
down
the
glass
the
whole
way
taste
is
exceptional
with
initial
malts
followed
by
a
hoppy
finish
and
yearns
for
you
to
take
the
next
sip
very
quaffable
beverage
here
and
redhooks
ipa
is
a
decent
beer
as
well
this
is
a
damn
poundable
beer
malty
lightly
hopped
and
very
clean
yes
its
25
owned
by
ab
i
dont
care
objectively
its
a
good
beer
and
ill
gladly
have
another
cheers
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
just
okay
sure
it
goes
down
easy
but
so
does
water
pours
up
ok
with
a
1
12
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
lacing
is
marginal
color
is
a
very
nice
amber
with
red
highlights
decent
looking
brew
would
be
nicer
if
it
had
a
little
better
head
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistant
grainy
with
some
slight
hop
presence
the
taste
is
oddly
refreshing
somewhat
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
finish
with
mild
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
creamier
than
i
had
expected
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
should
keep
this
one
around
as
a
crossover
for
some
of
my
buddies
the
mouthfeel
is
the
hallmark
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
grab
you
from
the
start
but
it
slowly
pulls
you
in
after
the
first
taste
and
swallow
i
havent
seen
very
many
beers
yet
with
this
frothiness
and
it
has
the
warmth
and
charm
of
a
good
octoberfest
without
the
spices
and
of
course
this
is
available
yearround
a
wonderful
introduction
to
an
esb
for
the
inexperienced
or
seasoned
beer
drinker
taste
was
sweet
malt
with
slightly
buttery
tone
following
seemed
pretty
light
on
the
hops
to
me
and
finished
mildly
had
a
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
ample
carbonation
all
in
all
a
good
start
to
this
case
of
brews
an
ok
bitter
i
suppose
but
completely
unbalanced
the
initial
malts
are
overwhelmed
by
the
grain
and
hop
flavors
and
the
two
dont
blend
instead
lingering
and
competing
for
your
attention
definately
needs
some
work
taste
was
very
sweet
and
crisp
followed
by
some
hops
a
dry
and
clean
aftertaste
remains
still
sweet
i
had
a
hard
time
putting
my
glass
down
enjoyable
drinkable
a
decent
and
readily
available
brew
next
time
you
see
it
pick
one
up
if
you
havent
already
for
some
reason
one
is
enough
for
me
in
a
sitting
very
pleasant
indeed
poured
a
hazy
medium
copper
color
with
red
tints
moderate
offwhite
head
that
fell
to
thin
ring
smell
is
sweet
maltiness
with
notes
of
caramel
taste
is
fruity
and
malty
but
the
hops
slowly
begin
to
show
their
presence
finishes
with
a
caramel
dryness
that
is
very
enjoyable
very
easy
to
drink
the
beer
extracts
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
deep
clear
amber
color
with
a
modest
frothy
light
tan
head
that
after
depletion
leaves
a
thin
but
concealing
sheet
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
with
malt
crisp
and
clean
start
is
also
sweet
with
a
light
but
adequate
grain
presence
which
leaves
a
pleasant
feel
at
the
top
finish
is
prickly
in
its
acidity
the
hops
adequate
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
after
taste
drinkable
and
a
nice
refreshing
beer
after
a
long
and
tiring
day
in
the
desert
beer
is
good
happy
beering
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
in
no
way
reflects
what
an
esb
should
be
imho
bland
but
unoffensive
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
if
offered
overall
not
the
best
esb
you
can
find
out
there
i
drank
the
whole
thing
without
a
problem
but
for
a
buck
or
two
more
a
sixer
you
can
get
lots
of
much
better
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
bland
but
inoffensive
beer
bottled
9
months
previous
to
when
i
boughtdrank
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
red
hue
decent
head
loses
life
quickly
while
lacing
remains
carbonation
remains
throughout
smells
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
rich
amber
ale
hops
pungent
signs
of
fruit
taste
is
that
of
overwhelming
hoppiness
mixed
with
citrus
beer
goes
down
leaving
a
strong
taste
of
alcohol
behind
carbonation
feels
good
on
the
tongue
making
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
if
an
ipa
and
dark
ale
mated
it
would
be
redhook
esb
im
quite
surprised
that
this
beverage
is
so
good
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
brew
with
a
bit
of
a
snap
go
for
this
it
poured
a
very
amberish
clear
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
took
a
while
to
settle
it
smelled
rather
overly
hoppy
and
just
about
nothing
else
it
was
very
creamy
and
went
down
smooth
with
good
taste
i
found
it
to
be
slightly
more
of
a
medium
bodied
beer
when
i
was
expecting
a
fullbodied
the
beer
was
tasty
but
a
little
to
bitter
and
nothing
spectacular
about
it
appearance
is
an
amber
with
white
foam
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
citrus
hops
brown
sugar
and
malt
initial
taste
is
a
smooth
blend
of
fruit
and
herbs
only
marred
by
the
excessive
diacetyl
that
coats
your
tongue
bitter
hops
and
electrolytes
are
sharp
leaving
the
tongue
a
bit
sore
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
too
raspy
to
have
more
than
one
a
tasty
brew
but
the
dry
finish
along
with
how
filling
it
gets
knock
it
down
a
bit
totally
different
than
the
bottled
version
seems
sweeter
esb
is
a
style
i
havent
sampled
many
of
so
im
not
sure
what
it
offers
but
i
feel
having
read
about
the
style
that
this
may
serve
as
a
decent
introduction
to
the
style
but
not
necessarily
a
good
example
of
it
drinkable
enjoyable
enough
this
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
for
introducing
noncraft
people
to
better
beer
much
better
esbs
out
there
in
my
not
so
humble
experience
medium
to
light
in
body
with
excessive
carbonation
almost
seltzer
like
this
is
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
tried
good
head
and
lacing
nose
of
fruit
and
hops
taste
was
less
bitter
than
expected
and
the
citrus
flavor
came
through
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
it
had
a
good
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
but
without
the
bite
it
finishes
quite
smooth
and
left
me
wanting
for
another
will
have
to
remember
this
esb
pours
a
light
hazy
bronze
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
it
has
a
faint
aroma
nothing
much
at
all
the
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
but
not
nearly
as
ferocious
as
i
was
hoping
for
you
can
taste
a
few
hops
and
a
mild
malt
character
almost
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
pale
ale
there
also
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
chemical
aftertaste
it
only
lasts
for
a
second
but
it
finds
its
way
into
every
sip
hmmm
the
mouthfeel
is
definitly
thin
and
lightbodied
not
incredibly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
than
one
clear
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
good
head
retention
sticks
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
fruit
tartness
sweet
malts
are
present
kind
of
buttery
the
taste
is
balanced
a
fair
amount
of
fruity
hops
are
balanced
by
a
buttery
malt
meduim
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
an
ok
esb
for
the
style
it
is
average
not
enough
hoppiness
for
an
esb
but
over
all
it
is
drinkable
a
very
drinkable
esb
all
in
all
not
100
to
style
but
good
pours
a
medium
amber
nice
head
and
great
clarity
nice
hoppy
taste
and
a
very
smooth
feel
on
the
tongue
not
very
bitter
compared
to
other
bitters
but
is
more
accessible
to
the
novice
than
say
fullers
esb
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
it
feels
like
the
beer
turned
flat
quicker
that
it
should
have
ive
only
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
before
i
was
attracted
to
it
because
of
their
winterhook
truely
a
great
beer
i
just
dont
see
any
of
the
specialness
in
this
beer
that
i
found
in
the
winterhook
overall
its
an
above
average
beer
thats
worth
drinking
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
not
heavy
enough
for
the
style
and
drinkablility
suffers
from
the
nearly
awful
finish
had
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
pour
when
served
was
very
light
copper
in
color
it
came
topped
with
a
faint
frothy
head
that
did
stay
around
long
enough
to
deliver
rings
of
lace
in
my
glass
clean
aroma
while
drinking
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
some
initial
metallic
notes
that
seemed
more
like
cleaning
agents
mostly
the
malt
came
through
and
i
thought
the
finish
was
a
bit
sweet
i
did
enjoy
watching
the
slow
bubbles
of
carbonation
rise
in
my
glass
drinkability
a
pleasant
if
sweet
swill
its
a
nice
brew
on
the
palate
and
pleasantly
drinkable
i
certainly
prefer
my
beer
a
little
more
adventurous
but
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
tasty
and
accessible
drinkability
while
i
am
not
well
versed
in
the
style
i
imagine
that
this
has
to
be
a
lightly
hopped
easy
drinker
that
is
what
this
beer
is
to
me
it
seems
to
fit
well
as
an
apa
not
overly
bitter
and
well
balanced
a
good
beer
for
the
masses
to
wean
them
off
bmc
purchase
on
sale
for
4
99
a
six
regularly
6
99
overall
a
decent
if
average
beer
it
probably
should
go
for
4
99
otherwise
it
is
overpriced
imo
upon
the
pour
this
looked
to
be
a
promising
beer
it
came
out
in
a
fine
white
3
inch
head
and
is
leaving
a
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
malts
with
almost
a
spicy
hint
to
it
taste
is
very
malty
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
hops
not
much
in
terms
of
the
bitter
as
advertised
in
the
esb
mouthfeel
is
average
in
weight
and
somewhat
lively
overall
drinkability
is
not
bad
this
is
definitely
a
quaffable
brew
but
one
i
will
not
seek
out
in
the
future
picked
up
a
6
pack
last
christmas
in
w
va
and
this
was
the
last
bottle
apparently
it
has
a
great
shelf
life
when
kept
cool
overall
a
decent
offering
when
surrounded
by
bud
miller
and
coors
wouldnt
purchase
a
6
of
it
but
wasnt
disappointed
ps
the
bottle
i
tasted
for
this
review
was
bottled
on
11302004
and
consumed
on
2182005
poured
out
to
a
very
light
orange
color
with
a
short
lived
white
lacey
head
that
quickly
disappeared
odors
of
oranges
and
fruit
with
a
touch
of
hops
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
weak
ale
even
mouth
feel
with
flavors
of
bitterness
malt
and
hops
has
a
watery
quality
to
it
that
is
not
all
that
undesireable
in
a
brew
of
this
nature
nothing
special
but
in
no
way
a
short
coming
worth
a
try
born
on
date
120704
in
my
opinion
redhook
esb
has
really
gone
down
hill
since
being
aquired
by
ab
very
faint
hop
aroma
that
used
to
dominate
this
brew
pours
a
pale
amber
brown
very
little
hop
bitterness
that
i
remember
when
it
was
packaged
in
stubby
brown
bottles
i
wont
waste
my
time
with
this
one
again
this
is
one
of
the
best
readily
available
beers
that
i
have
ever
consumed
i
recommend
it
for
a
great
session
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
also
it
is
an
amazing
deal
for
the
price
a
keg
of
esb
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away
well
maybe
not
but
close
taste
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
weak
malt
presence
up
front
and
a
nice
clean
hop
finish
that
is
more
akin
to
a
pale
ale
than
an
esb
so
in
this
regard
it
comes
short
it
kind
of
tastes
like
bass
with
more
malt
quite
carbonated
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
in
general
its
like
drinking
semi
flat
beer
soda
not
bad
beer
soda
but
soda
nevertheless
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
this
a
session
brew
only
in
a
pinch
and
only
if
they
didnt
have
sierra
which
would
be
impossible
if
they
had
this
and
not
that
theres
a
chance
that
something
could
have
been
wrong
with
this
sixer
but
the
date
said
that
it
wasnt
bottled
too
long
ago
so
go
figure
typical
appearance
amber
color
nothing
particularly
outstanding
so
i
wont
waste
any
space
smell
is
pretty
nondescript
a
definate
hop
profile
fruity
citrusy
maybe
and
a
tad
buttery
or
oily
or
something
also
a
little
metalic
and
dusty
but
not
in
that
desirable
saison
funkyness
way
if
you
know
what
i
mean
that
metalic
smell
definately
comes
through
in
the
taste
as
well
and
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
whole
experience
too
watery
for
sure
watery
watery
watery
i
really
hate
to
bash
a
beer
but
this
one
really
didnt
impress
me
at
all
and
before
my
beeradvocate
days
i
remember
having
a
liking
for
red
hook
but
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
go
back
to
this
one
clear
copper
firm
tan
head
with
great
fortitude
maltyfruity
scent
that
was
slightly
subdued
full
flavored
not
as
aggresively
hopped
as
others
which
i
enjoyed
very
satisfying
well
balanced
deserves
its
popularity
ill
buy
it
again
nice
pale
ale
but
nothing
too
exciting
drinkability
good
drinkability
because
it
does
go
down
rather
smooth
and
is
a
nice
thirstquencher
if
you
reach
into
your
fridge
and
happen
to
grab
one
drinkability
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
brew
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
overall
just
lacking
in
typical
esb
qualities
and
any
real
defining
character
pretty
run
of
the
mill
i
guess
i
know
why
ba
frowns
upon
rating
from
memory
i
find
that
i
prefer
to
drink
redhook
out
of
the
bottle
cant
explain
that
drinkability
yes
heck
of
a
session
beer
not
something
you
want
to
sit
down
and
analyze
cause
theres
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
its
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
whilst
doing
something
else
thats
engaging
this
might
be
a
good
transition
brew
to
give
your
bmc
friends
skein
of
initial
head
with
lacing
though
that
disappears
quickly
likely
due
to
improper
rinsing
of
the
glassware
amber
and
lilting
gold
to
hue
with
some
constant
action
though
difficult
to
discern
in
the
poor
lighting
of
the
joint
soapy
droopy
malt
and
rancid
pork
rinds
to
bouquet

perhaps
unclean
lines
challenged
malt
to
taste
with
only
suggestions
of
bitterness
however
after
warming
some
bitter
character
did
manage
to
power
its
way
through
in
the
end
simply
cannot
recommend
this
as
a
result
of
its
dreary
allaround
profile
it
poured
a
slightly
burnt
orangeamber
in
color
without
any
head
to
mention
the
hops
were
very
much
present
but
they
did
not
linger
too
long
into
the
aftertaste
not
as
bold
a
hoppiness
as
i
find
myself
liking
lately
but
i
was
not
displeased
in
any
way
definitely
would
make
a
good
session
beer
there
were
also
hints
of
citrus
in
the
taste
definitely
a
great
backup
beer
it
is
a
nice
american
esb
not
extreme
but
a
decent
example
of
the
style
imho
it
has
a
nice
full
malty
extremely
hoppy
flavor
that
i
find
extremely
refreshing
it
is
not
my
first
choice
among
readily
available
beers
but
it
is
a
strong
second
and
its
only
drawback
is
that
i
prefer
other
styles
of
beer
that
said
when
i
am
in
the
mood
i
am
more
than
willing
to
enjoy
this
fine
beer
color
is
light
amber
really
weak
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
smell
is
hoppy
with
hint
of
citrus
but
seems
fairly
mediocre
taste
is
pretty
hopped
with
a
strong
citrus
flavor
citrus
taste
might
be
just
a
tad
bit
too
strong
for
me
still
i
enjoyed
redhook
esb
it
isnt
great
just
very
good
i
havent
had
any
esbs
before
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
this
beer
poured
an
amber
that
wasnt
very
dark
and
you
could
see
through
it
it
poured
a
fairly
sizeable
head
that
stayed
around
with
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
its
aroma
was
similar
to
other
esb
style
ales
but
with
a
slight
citrus
to
it
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
as
it
wasnt
as
bold
as
i
expected
but
not
bad
by
any
means
i
did
like
the
hops
bite
that
these
type
of
beers
are
known
for
an
altogether
good
beer
i
could
see
my
self
sitting
down
and
drinking
a
few
for
some
reason
its
not
rated
too
well
here
and
i
have
a
few
ideas
on
why
that
might
be
the
case
it
is
nothing
unique
that
is
for
sure
and
there
are
many
better
beers
to
be
had
however
i
strongly
feel
that
the
popularity
of
this
beer
is
a
huge
step
in
the
right
direction
for
the
state
of
beer
consumption
in
the
us
in
a
country
where
bud
and
the
silver
bullet
reign
supreme
for
a
beer
like
this
to
become
so
popular
and
have
such
a
wide
distribution
is
really
quite
significant
overall
this
is
a
little
too
raw
and
harsh
on
the
palate
for
my
tastes
though
overall
is
a
decent
beer
and
is
worth
a
try
it
presents
a
very
good
example
of
its
style
too
theres
one
inch
of
yellowishwhitetan
dense
pillowy
head
on
top
of
the
clear
amber
body
a
slight
redpink
blush
runny
spots
and
bigger
structures
of
lacing
nose
is
reminiscent
of
grape
soda
really
fruity
grapes
again
in
the
slightly
metallic
front
middle
is
thinning
with
some
tangy
malt
finishes
nicely
nutty
hoppy
bitter
its
not
bad
nothing
really
special
more
like
a
plain
american
micro
amber
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
its
a
very
nice
beer
but
a
bit
outside
my
style
preferences
if
youre
an
ipa
drinker
or
even
a
pa
drinker
this
has
plenty
of
that
nice
hop
crispness
with
the
added
bonus
of
a
very
nice
complex
malt
taste
with
a
respectable
body
id
certainly
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
i
dont
think
id
ever
drink
more
than
one
in
a
day
this
beer
was
a
very
nice
amber
color
with
an
impressive
head
i
was
not
quite
as
impessed
with
the
taste
it
is
a
malty
taste
with
a
very
mild
hop
taste
it
does
not
have
quite
as
full
a
body
or
as
rich
a
taste
as
i
would
have
expected
with
an
esb
do
not
get
me
wrong
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
simply
unimpressive
like
many
of
redhooks
offerings
the
taste
is
definitely
hoppy
with
a
distinct
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
fairly
good
bitter
considering
how
ubiquitous
it
is
in
the
retail
markets
overall
a
good
brew
this
is
good
enough
beer
i
suppose
its
not
terrible
its
not
great
its
just
a
little
on
the
bland
side
the
color
head
and
smell
are
nice
the
taste
is
of
chocolate
bitterness
and
malt
its
actually
a
decent
taste
but
there
is
just
not
enough
of
it
to
warrant
a
good
review
if
it
were
a
little
bit
stronger
this
could
be
a
very
good
beer
quite
flavorful
the
hoppiness
that
was
present
in
the
aroma
is
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
malt
that
subtley
tickles
the
tongue
along
with
the
carbonation
from
this
brew
enjoyed
at
the
2003
nit
basketball
championship
game
georgia
tech
was
victorious
this
was
my
first
sampling
of
the
esb
style
and
i
think
that
it
might
not
have
been
a
good
place
to
start
i
was
expecting
a
hoppy
beer
on
par
with
an
ipa
what
i
got
was
a
beer
that
was
hopped
more
like
an
average
pale
this
is
not
to
say
that
i
didnt
enjoy
the
beer
just
that
i
think
it
is
wrongly
categorized
a
good
session
beer
because
of
its
subdued
hop
character
the
taste
is
mostly
of
malt
hops
peak
through
in
the
finish
but
just
barely
i
cant
tell
of
this
was
supposed
to
be
more
of
an
amber
or
more
of
an
esb
it
doesnt
stack
up
that
well
against
my
favorites
of
either
however
had
this
on
tap
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
monster
that
remained
throughout
the
glass
clunks
of
lacing
surrounded
the
glass
reminding
you
how
far
you
have
come
the
smell
is
of
citrus
orange
and
lime
hints
of
lemon
with
a
powerful
tone
of
hops
a
bit
of
rawness
as
well
the
taste
is
a
super
creamy
smooth
refreshing
bite
of
citrus
and
hops
and
malts
a
hint
of
creamy
heavy
cream
a
medium
bodied
refreshing
brew
i
usually
stock
a
few
of
these
in
the
basement
fridge
a
good
ballgame
beer
here
in
seattle
this
one
ends
up
in
my
fridge
once
in
a
while
then
i
remember
that
it
is
good
to
have
a
decent
brew
around
to
keep
things
in
perspective
the
great
clarity
comes
from
the
ultra
filtering
they
do
to
increase
the
shelflife
unfortunately
it
takes
a
bit
of
flavor
out
of
the
brew
simple
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
an
aleish
like
quality
clean
a
refresing
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
just
not
something
that
i
go
crazy
for
an
average
interpretation
of
the
style
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
stayed
around
awhile
as
a
thin
layer
of
foam
on
top
the
smell
has
hints
of
hoppiness
but
is
mostly
made
up
of
sweet
malt
scents
the
flavor
is
very
smoothe
and
nonintrusive
the
malt
flavors
overpower
the
hops
quite
a
bit
but
there
is
still
a
touch
of
hops
in
there
i
give
this
one
high
marks
for
drinkability
since
is
tastes
like
a
good
session
beer
but
not
one
i
will
be
buying
on
a
regular
basis
this
strikes
me
as
a
wannabe
fullers
esb
only
they
stopped
short
way
short
maybe
its
the
filtering
as
mentioned
in
other
reviews
or
ive
heard
this
beer
has
lost
a
lot
of
character
since
making
the
big
time
its
easy
on
the
palate
so
it
could
be
a
great
beer
for
nonbas
to
start
with
i
was
looking
for
a
maltier
hoppier
beer
try
the
redhook
ipa
a
very
good
looking
beer
and
a
good
beer
in
general
but
not
great
a
esb
in
my
estimation
should
have
been
better
for
draught
the
bottle
i
find
are
better
at
least
with
food
its
a
travesty
on
tap
poured
into
a
redhook
esb
pint
glass
it
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
lots
of
lacing
left
over
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
but
a
little
light
though
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
with
some
sweetness
the
finish
is
fairly
hoppy
the
body
is
a
little
light
but
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
not
a
bad
esb
not
a
halfbad
sessioner
anything
with
this
bitterness
goes
so
well
with
spicy
food
the
two
flavors
just
seem
to
open
you
up
for
each
other
nice
little
beer
although
i
see
myself
making
many
stops
at
other
beers
before
i
return
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
new
winking
lizard
in
columbus
decent
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
barely
any
hops
to
smell
or
rather
any
smell
at
all
expected
a
little
citrus
or
spice
kind
of
bland
unfortunately
decent
taste
nothing
extraordinary
to
brag
about
decent
use
of
hops
and
a
little
sugary
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
type
of
esb
too
bland
i
enjoyed
the
drink
and
would
have
another
but
not
when
theres
other
offerings
redhook
esb
sits
in
your
glass
with
a
ambercopper
color
the
head
is
small
and
fleeting
the
scent
is
just
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
you
wont
be
bowled
over
by
hops
or
malt
youll
probably
notice
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
the
overall
product
is
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
again
does
its
job
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
i
had
never
seen
this
in
my
area
until
yesterday
at
a
local
virginia
grocery
bottled
on
date
was
only
a
month
ago
and
it
was
obviously
a
new
arrival
not
even
chilled
down
in
the
stores
cooler
poured
into
a
redhook
pint
glass
its
a
clear
shiny
copper
amber
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
islands
of
lace
aroma
is
subdued
with
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
mouthfeel
has
medium
to
high
carbonation
is
a
bit
creamy
and
coating
and
has
a
bitter
hops
bite
taste
is
biscuity
malt
and
bitter
english
style
hops
not
very
complex
and
missing
the
nuttiness
of
a
good
esb
this
is
closer
to
an
amber
ale
in
character
but
not
at
all
bad
and
very
drinkable
i
had
this
on
tap
about
3
weeks
ago
at
pazzos
in
lexington
ky
and
my
notes
from
the
draft
tasting
are
virtually
identical
to
this
fresh
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
an
orangebrown
and
forms
a
substantial
but
shortlived
white
head
it
smells
like
beer
and
showcases
a
slight
pacific
northwest
twist
on
a
traditional
british
brew
style
the
hopping
is
not
over
the
top
its
balanced
by
some
mild
malt
flavors
its
a
solid
beer
which
i
wouldnt
travel
far
to
acquire
but
would
accept
as
a
reasonable
substitute
for
more
intricately
crafted
beers
nice
orangegold
color
little
head
that
leaves
quickly
smells
like
a
sweetwater
ipa
for
those
who
have
had
one
crisp
citrus
hops
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
strong
hops
feel
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
obviously
not
really
what
i
would
describe
as
an
exceptional
beer
but
not
anything
noticably
bad
taste
im
not
all
that
impressed
not
too
offensive
and
has
some
flavor
but
that
flavor
is
just
average
at
best
has
some
taste
characterics
of
a
lager
its
a
little
bit
grainy
the
start
is
buttery
malts
fine
here
then
sournessand
a
pinch
of
hops
that
helps
then
alchohol
then
more
sourness
in
back
but
different
sweet
bready
fruity
slightly
metallic
but
all
combined
to
one
simple
flavor
aftertaste
is
strangely
bitter
and
bready
this
is
wierd
because
there
was
almost
no
bitterness
when
the
beer
was
in
my
mouth
or
throat
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
oily
all
in
all
to
me
this
is
acceptable
joey
beef
notes
the
first
redhook
beer
ive
tried
and
from
what
i
can
see
one
of
their
most
popular
brews
not
impressive
but
easy
to
get
along
with
maybe
ill
buy
it
if
i
see
it
on
sale
now
if
i
can
just
get
my
hands
on
some
of
that
double
black
stout
very
drinkable
brew
not
the
best
at
anything
but
a
solid
competent
beer
nothing
special
here
a
decent
middle
of
the
road
brew
not
as
hoppy
as
the
style
would
suggest
faint
hop
nose
english
malt
and
semi
hoppy
in
the
middle
and
a
dud
of
a
finish
this
one
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
this
brewery
is
a
mystery
to
me
i
think
there
beers
have
gone
to
the
middle
of
the
beer
road
lately
the
taste
is
assertively
hoppy
and
citric
initially
with
notes
of
lime
and
tangerine
dominating
the
taste
settles
down
into
a
nice
smooth
maltiness
that
sticks
to
the
palate
nice
and
chewy
in
the
mouth
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
both
refreshing
and
potent
pours
a
kinda
ruddy
reddish
brown
with
very
minimal
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
malty
with
a
touch
of
spice
but
not
much
too
it
at
all
the
flavour
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
the
malt
it
just
doesnt
have
the
bitter
that
an
esb
needs
not
a
bad
beer
just
something
lacking
a
bit
off
style
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
average
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
enough
a
bit
oily
though
drinkability
is
average
can
drink
a
few
of
them
but
after
a
time
kinda
get
tired
of
the
one
track
flavour
also
i
noticed
about
an
hour
later
i
could
still
taste
it
in
my
mouth
which
was
not
good
a
watered
down
esb
shame
certainly
this
is
not
the
best
example
of
an
esb
youre
going
to
run
across
however
given
the
easy
drinking
and
relatively
cheap
price
its
a
good
substitute
for
a
wretched
macro
during
a
footballwing
fest
i
hadnt
had
this
one
in
awhile
but
it
is
always
a
good
standby
when
other
better
beers
are
unavailable
this
one
has
a
decent
copper
color
to
it
a
bit
of
a
head
an
ok
aroma
of
malts
and
hops
a
fair
bitterness
to
it
with
a
good
malt
body
i
remember
when
i
thought
that
this
was
a
very
bitter
beer
still
quite
drinkable
it
will
be
like
in
a
bottle
because
of
the
situation
i
drank
this
striaght
from
the
bottle
has
a
light
body
and
not
enough
of
a
bitterness
that
is
important
for
an
esb
still
this
was
an
above
average
beer
and
id
definitely
get
it
again
if
chosing
between
that
or
macros
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
is
dry
and
malty
it
has
the
musty
smell
that
a
lot
of
english
ales
posess
the
taste
is
good
it
also
is
dry
and
malty
it
is
quite
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
rather
enjoyable
a
good
esb
for
a
bottled
beer
this
is
extremely
excellent
the
amber
color
was
beautiful
head
was
thick
at
first
but
disipated
quickly
although
the
lacing
was
distinct
as
the
glass
emptied
smelled
pallatable
but
not
memorable
tasted
bitter
but
smooth
lingering
bitterness
but
pleasant
in
the
mouth
quite
drinkable
in
the
end
an
amber
color
with
a
quick
disolving
head
that
leaves
pleanty
of
lace
a
smell
that
was
fruity
citrusy
and
nutty
the
taste
was
similar
yet
it
was
very
clean
tasting
a
nice
bitter
taste
going
down
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
without
a
doubt
buy
it
again
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
head
that
had
to
be
agressively
conjured
up
quickly
desolved
to
a
thin
bubbly
film
lacing
was
good
aroma
was
nice
with
a
hoppy
citrus
and
slightly
hidden
malts
a
very
mild
taste
from
theis
beer
not
very
bitter
but
still
had
nice
balance
and
finished
with
a
good
dryness
that
didnt
tire
the
palate
drinkable
was
a
plus
although
a
bit
different
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
its
drinkability
is
its
high
point
nothing
special
but
pretty
good
the
redhook
website
says
this
has
a
sweet
finish
but
i
found
it
decidedly
dry
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
this
is
an
ok
session
beer
its
a
little
over
priced
for
that
however
theres
really
nothing
about
this
that
would
make
me
replace
kokanee
as
my
beer
for
macrodrinking
thin
fizzy
appearance
but
with
a
pleasing
bright
amber
color
hints
of
a
citrus
acidity
and
malt
on
the
nose
one
of
the
less
bitter
beers
to
carry
a
bitter
name
those
notes
are
mostly
overpowered
by
a
good
balance
of
cereal
and
citrus
flavors
mouthfeel
is
good
if
somewhat
fizzy
quite
drinkable
by
far
this
beers
strongest
point
not
a
terribly
complex
brew
but
a
good
standby
and
something
you
can
easily
serve
to
company
who
may
think
a
lager
is
man
who
cuts
down
trees
drinkability

this
is
the
beers
strong
point
imho
i
dont
know
if
id
call
it
a
strong
bitter
but
the
presence
of
bitter
hops
along
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
and
a
nonoffensive
fruity
sweetness
makes
this
well
balanced
and
an
easy
drinker
bottled
on
081203
slightly
hazy
amber
gold
color
pours
with
an
offwhite
head
that
is
fairly
persistant
but
with
largish
bubbles
aroma
is
of
a
hoppy
floral
citrus
one
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
thrown
in
the
mix
a
nutty
malty
taste
mixed
with
a
solid
hop
flavor
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
a
certain
dryness
this
beer
has
a
fullness
of
body
to
it
that
coats
ones
mouth
as
you
sip
it
eminantly
quaffable
i
am
not
a
fan
of
hoppybitter
beers
but
i
am
a
big
fan
of
redhook
esb
this
was
the
second
beer
i
tried
from
rh
the
first
was
the
double
black
stout
which
i
liked
alot
the
esb
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
my
swilling
beer
of
choice
in
the
winter
good
flavor
decent
price
i
have
liked
everything
that
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
they
make
good
beer
i
like
this
one
on
a
hot
day
a
good
thirst
quencher
pours
dark
with
amber
high
lights
the
head
is
extremely
white
and
foamy
nice
and
thick
good
bitter
taste
you
can
almost
feel
the
hop
popping
in
every
sip
very
nice
finnish
malty
and
dry
as
soon
as
i
was
done
i
was
looking
for
another
medium
gold
color
slightly
cloudy
medium
head
medium
hopped
and
malted
smooth
beer
some
malt
sweetness
light
taste
full
flavor
excellent
balance
of
hops
and
malts
full
smooth
round
mouthfeel
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
hoppy
on
my
top
10
list
of
everyday
beers
looks
rather
pale
with
a
clear
orangeamber
color
lots
of
carbonation
as
well
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
whith
the
aroma
is
metallic
the
taste
seems
to
be
a
bit
grainy
with
that
same
metallic
flavor
thankfully
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
flavor
in
there
as
well
but
its
just
tastes
to
think
to
be
very
enjoyable
too
bad
i
cant
find
the
double
black
stout
anymore
this
redhook
was
pretty
much
a
disappointment
overall
impression
a
moderately
good
beer
no
major
flaws
but
just
not
very
lively
drinkability
isnt
bad
doesnt
slow
you
down
doesnt
invite
you
back
for
another
a
really
average
beer
i
msut
admit
it
was
my
first
esb
so
i
dont
have
much
to
weigh
it
against
the
packaging
says
its
an
esbamber
ale
i
think
amber
ale
might
be
more
appropriate
cause
i
find
little
variation
between
this
and
other
amber
ales
its
a
fine
ber
dont
get
me
wrong
goes
down
easy
smooth
looks
niceredish
amber
color
with
quickly
disapating
head
id
say
its
worth
an
attempt
if
your
at
a
bar
but
dont
bother
with
a
6er
of
it
as
you
will
be
let
down
that
you
spent
7
bucks
on
such
an
average
beer
f
an
average
beer
that
is
jammed
into
the
esb
category
in
name
only
it
pours
a
slight
amber
with
a
moderate
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
filled
with
citrus
notes
but
not
overthetop
the
flavor
seems
a
bit
harsh
with
the
malty
flavors
not
blending
particularly
well
with
the
hop
bitterness
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
more
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
what
a
disappointment
it
looks
decent
in
the
glass
witha
copper
color
and
fine
white
head
but
when
the
serious
evaluation
begins
this
beer
just
cant
stand
up
the
hop
aroma
is
nonexistent
in
fact
this
beer
is
devoid
of
almost
all
aroma
at
first
sip
there
is
a
barely
perceptable
hop
bitterness
and
a
light
malt
presence
but
thats
it
no
complex
fruity
esters
or
spicy
hop
flavors
that
i
normally
associate
with
e
s
bs
this
beer
is
completely
neutral
in
flavor
i
was
barely
able
to
finish
my
first
bottle
and
luckily
i
was
able
to
foist
off
the
rest
of
the
sixpack
on
my
unsuspecting
neighbor
notes
thin
mouthfeel
good
clean
session
beer
not
outstanding
not
too
noteworthy
color
is
a
clear
yellowy
amber
with
a
inch
high
head
of
offwhite
spongy
foam
that
settles
down
slowly
to
leave
spots
of
lace
smell
is
faint
of
roasty
malts
kinda
breadish
like
soft
pretzels
with
a
nice
light
dry

backing
taste
is
toasty
malts
and
dry
hops
balanced
together
well
a
slight
bread
tone
to
the
malts
with
a
note
of
saltynessnutty
and
a
small
bitterness
lingers
from
the
hops
thats
quite
easy
to
handle
and
favors
some
herbal
qualities
and
dryness
feel
is
close
to
medium
with
a
small
kick
just
past
midway
not
a
bad
esb
id
have
it
again
if
offered
so
far
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
redhook
pours
a
deep
goldenamber
color
with
a
light
somewhat
fizzy
headaroma
is
lightly
sweet
but
not
much
there
taste
is
malty
and
a
little
nutty
with
some
caramel
tonesthe
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
taste
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
hoping
it
would
be
better
but
it
never
is
at
one
time
i
guess
this
was
topnotch
when
this
beer
was
poured
into
my
glass
the
head
was
small
ivory
and
it
contained
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
was
carbonated
and
murky
the
hue
was
copper
and
the
lacing
was
sparse
the
nose
was
hoppy
and
the
flavor
consisted
of
alcohol
hops
and
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
on
my
tongue
smooth
and
somewhat
thin
not
terribly
aweinspiring
pretty
bland
nose
with
some
very
subdued
hints
of
citrus
from
the
hops
a
little
leafiness
and
some
malt
flavor
is
plain
starts
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
but
finishes
with
a
slightly
grating
hop
bitterness
herbal
then
bitter
bitterness
lingers
and
not
in
a
pleasant
way
a
little
off
for
the
style
i
think
i
think
they
should
have
opted
for
a
little
more
of
the
extra
special
and
a
little
less
of
the
bitter
clear
medium
amber
big
tan
head
that
diminishes
at
the
speed
of
light
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
fairly
well
balanced
by
some
mildsweet
maltiness
and
a
mild
floral
hop
aroma
flavor
starts
sweet
clean
and
crisp
ends
with
some
hoppiness
and
a
little
acidity
slightly
thin
body
some
metallic
hints
showed
up
middleend
this
has
an
light
red
almost
amber
color
to
it
smells
like
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
malts
the
hops
and
malts
have
a
lot
of
interplay
in
this
one
almost
like
they
are
each
fighting
to
be
the
dominant
flavor
i
cant
tell
what
is
dominant
in
this
beer
though
i
notice
dextrin
sweetness
and
some
caramel
malts
floral
hops
are
there
and
citrus
fruit
hops
seem
to
be
there
finishes
grainy
and
decent
but
not
exceptional
an
all
around
solid
beer
but
nothing
great
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
drinkable
to
reiterate
a
good
but
not
great
esb
i
really
think
this
is
the
crown
jewel
of
the
red
hook
line
pours
a
clean
looking
light
orange
a
soft
white
lace
rests
atop
it
i
like
the
nose
sweet
fruit
and
floral
notes
in
the
aroma
wish
it
was
a
tich
stronger
but
still
nice
body
is
about
right
for
an
esb
firm
and
tight
flavors
combine
a
nice
malt
balance
to
the
sweet
fruit
hops
on
the
finish
a
nice
west
coast
citrus
hop
flavor
emerges
im
drinking
this
out
of
my
brand
new
english
style
pint
glasses
and
am
happy
to
baptise
them
with
the
underrated
esb
honey
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
excellent
lacing
around
the
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
strong
hop
with
floral
and
pine
notes
flavor
is
strong
hop
not
bitter
with
pine
and
mild
citrus
very
nice
lingering
hop
aftertaste
malt
flavor
seems
to
broaden
and
creep
up
on
my
tongue
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
not
overly
complex
but
a
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
beer
a
beer
by
popular
reputation
that
was
worth
trying
i
wasnt
dissappointed
aroma
was
lighter
than
expected
but
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
hops
sweet
a
little
with
a
little
citrus
but
also
flowery
nice
looking
beer
with
a
bold
amber
color
medium
head
a
little
fizzy
good
stability
and
nice
lacing
bold
enough
flavor
with
a
good
mix
of
malt
foundation
with
some
sweetness
surrounded
by
complex
hops
character
some
sour
bitter
citrus
but
all
pleasing
nice
smoothness
in
spite
of
the
bitterness
and
the
beer
softens
as
it
warms
pleasant
richness
without
excessiveness
im
pretty
impressed
may
be
a
little
sweet
at
times
otherwise
very
well
rounded
beer
that
i
wont
hesitate
to
purchase
or
imbide
again
overall
its
a
long
survived
classic
for
a
reason
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
just
enough
character
to
keep
you
awake
but
not
so
much
as
to
frighten
the
natives
a
decent
choice
in
limited
selections
i
liked
it
better
on
draught
its
amberorange
with
a
small
head
my
nose
is
horrible
right
now
but
i
do
get
some
fruity
notes
out
of
it
nothing
all
that
great
its
creamy
at
first
with
some
sweet
malts
medium
bodied
and
then
crisp
carbonation
and
mild
hops
finishes
the
gulp
it
comes
across
as
bland
for
an
esb
its
a
pretty
boring
beer
but
i
got
it
for
4
99
a
sixer
so
it
was
worth
a
try
at
that
price
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
short
lasting
and
little
lace
mostly
malt
aroma
slight
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
butterscotch
lightly
toasted
malt
smooth
and
drinkable
not
your
typical
esb
but
drinkable
overall
a
slight
bit
above
average
note
the
brewery
must
be
doing
less
filtering
as
the
beer
was
definitely
cloudy
i
drank
it
slowly
and
noticed
a
small
amount
of
light
brown
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
pours
a
nice
head
about
a
centimeter
but
very
creamy
it
settles
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
medium
amber
color
smells
of
malts
and
tastes
the
same
and
a
little
bitter
very
thick
as
it
rolls
around
my
tongue
it
feels
as
if
i
almost
have
to
chew
it
this
experience
is
nice
but
it
makes
the
beer
a
little
less
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
poured
a
gold
orange
in
color
with
very
little
head
fruity
sweet
smell
with
some
hints
of
caramel
the
more
it
warms
the
more
the
butterscothdiacetyl
aromas
and
flavors
come
through
and
the
more
apparent
it
is
that
this
beer
is
all
about
the
diacetyl
biscuity
grain
and
caramel
were
also
percieved
on
the
tongue
i
suppose
i
am
spoiled
in
that
i
find
this
beer
only
slightly
better
than
average
there
are
so
many
wonderful
beers
at
my
disposal
that
through
no
fault
of
its
own
this
beer
falls
by
the
wayside
i
went
into
a
new
packie
tonight
to
see
how
the
stock
was
and
was
dismayed
to
find
only
bud
miller
heineken
o
wait
this
is
bud
redhook
was
the
only
drinkable
alternative
other
than
sams
st
pauli
im
tired
of
sams
and
brown
bottles
always
win
over
green
class
im
surprised
to
discover
it
as
satisying
as
i
am
right
now
superclear
with
decent
head
and
lace
a
citrusy
buttery
thirstquenching
brew
certainly
one
of
redhooks
better
beers
too
bad
that
the
rye
is
no
longer
available
now
thats
one
beer
that
didnt
often
fall
by
the
wayside
lots
of
lemon
flavors
bolstered
by
diacetyl
butter
quite
sweet
from
malts
and
some
tartness
at
finish
which
becomes
obliterated
by
lingering
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
smooth
and
persuasive
perhaps
the
high
point
of
the
brew
drinkability
good
too
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
remember
this
is
my
goto
beer
at
mustang
harrys
whenever
im
in
the
neighborhood
of
madison
square
garden
for
a
game
or
a
concert
although
i
really
should
try
to
squeeze
in
a
visit
to
the
gingerman
if
im
in
that
area
id
suggest
bringing
this
to
a
gathering
where
obscure
microbeers
have
a
low
penetration
ratio
redhook
beers
are
very
user
friendly
this
beer
now
comes
in
longnecks
all
the
better
for
that
lets
get
hammered
scenario
when
your
favored
pint
glass
is
unavailable
drinkability
gimme
more
anyone
who
is
even
remotely
aware
of
budweisers
slanderous
and
unlawful
attack
against
samuel
adams
use
of
contract
brewers
has
to
laugh
at
the
irony
of
budweisers
partnership
with
red
hook
ale
brewery
of
woodinville
washington
brewing
beer
in
portsmouth
new
hampshire
brewers
of
fine
beers
who
wish
to
expand
operations
in
order
to
provide
consumers
fresh
quantities
of
their
product
should
be
commended
not
vilified
that
said
red
hook
a
beer
with
ties
to
budweiser
is
despite
all
the
negative
connotations
a
good
beer
the
deep
amber
color
represents
a
full
rich
body
the
hops
while
not
overly
potent
provide
tealike
and
citrus
bitterness
the
malty
and
light
hop
aroma
is
mild
but
pleasant
the
white
head
dissipates
at
an
average
rate
wherever
this
ale
was
made
and
whoever
brewed
it
did
a
good
job
this
beer
came
with
a
fair
head
it
was
a
bright
clear
amber
the
aroma
was
at
best
average
i
did
not
notice
a
particularly
strong
aroma
of
any
type
the
bitterness
in
the
taste
was
quite
nice
and
offset
the
sweetness
the
beer
finished
moderately
bitter
but
not
overpowering
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
over
conversation
with
friends
this
beer
poured
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
had
sort
of
a
fruity
tone
to
it
and
perhaps
some
floral
hops
it
seemed
to
have
that
grainy
macro
swill
aroma
as
well
although
it
wasnt
bad
smelling
the
taste
for
me
was
sort
of
a
let
down
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
good
bitterness
but
there
was
little
of
that
here
the
taste
up
front
had
hints
of
caramel
and
citrus
flavors
the
finish
had
little
hops
bitterness
but
it
was
more
prevalent
than
anything
else
the
mouthfeel
was
sort
of
sharp
up
front
but
went
down
fairly
smooth
overall
i
liked
this
brew
and
would
drink
it
again
but
there
are
many
other
beers
to
try
first
looking
again
at
the
bottle
it
is
called
redhook
esb
but
it
also
says
rich
amber
ale
this
beer
is
definitely
more
inline
with
what
i
would
call
an
amber
even
considering
that
like
an
ab
yeast
strain
the
finishing
hops
are
completely
different
with
hints
of
corn
and
fusel
alcohols
a
completely
different
beer
a
fall
back
beer
at
best
markfeb

but
the
bottle
was
a
little
old
cloudy

great

microbrew

with

this
is
a

on

not

finishing
rather

just
the

one
of
the
better
esbs

much
more

than
id
expect
it
to
carry
especially
at
just
5
abv
smell
and
taste
both
have
a

of
caramel
some

a

finishes
bitter
with
a
piney
hop
bitter
and
dry
with
a
really
bright
carbonationwe
both
really
liked
it
it
didnt
wear
down
the
palate
easily
i
dont
think
its
as
creamy
as
other
esbs
but
i
kind
of
like
this
lighter
version
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
with
a
hint
of
grass
thrown
in
definitely
a
malty
beer
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
some
toffee
and
biscuit
malt
with
a
bit
of
grass
and
earth
mixed
in
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
esb
overall
a
really
nicely
balanced
beer
between
sweet
malt
and
bitter
coppery
hops
i
really
nice
beer
to
drink
ive
been
saving
this
bottle
for
a
while
to
review
because
i
ended
up
drinking
the
rest
of
the
sixpack
over
a
week
it
was
just
the
kind
of
beer
i
wanted
after
a
day
of
working
its
got
a
nice
sweetness
without
being
too
sweet
to
drink
and
a
nice
bitter
without
being
offensive
to
people
who
might
mind
bitterness
in
beer
its
really
a
great
example
of
the
esb
style
and
a
really
great
canadian
beer
o
one
of
the
better
esbs
from
north
america
extremely
drinkable
i
would
have
this
one
again
super
easy
drinkability
good
session
beer
not
as
good
as
i
remember
but
it
could
be
because
i
kept
this
one
too
long
overall
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
and
tasty
esb
a
solid
offering
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
but
a
nice
drink
none
the
less
o
a
decent
esb
although
i
would
like
it
a
little
hoppier
d
will
be
picking
this
up
again
every
once
in
a
while
as
its
a
very
nice
and
sessionable
esb
would
like
to
try
this
ontap
but
i
guess
will
have
to
wait
until
a
trip
out
east
od
not
bad
probably
to
style
but
not
close
to
fullers
the
fruity
notes
in
the
aroma
dont
carry
through
to
the
taste
a
good
one
but
not
close
to
the
benchmark
gets
a
little
heavy
the
more
you
drink
overall
enjoyed
it
this
isnt
usually
one
of
my
favourite
styles
but
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
now
and
then
a
wellmade
very
drinkable
bitter
not
the
best
esb
ive
had
but
definitely
a
great
representation
of
the
style
looking
forward
to
try
more
of
their
beers
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
creamy
and
chunky
offwhite
head
moderate
retention
and
lace
nose
is
malty
nutty
with
some
nice
caramel
notes
straightforward
and
plain
taste
has
some
light
hopping
some
malt
that
offers
some
earthy
notes
nutty
a
slight
roastiness
which
is
weird
for
the
stlye
and
dark
bread
higher
carbonation
than
id
like
in
the
mouthfeel
that
has
a
mediumlight
weight
to
it
moderate
bitterness
stays
around
for
a
bit
pleasant
and
simple
needs
more
hop
character
if
anything
maybe
my
bottle
is
just
a
wee
bit
old
but
im
a
little
nonplussed
by
the
hop
character
in
this
esb
the
bitterness
is
there
but
manifests
more
in
the
fruit
character
from
the
also
not
all
that
biscuity
malt
rather
than
from
the
hops
wait
a
sec
is
that
what
its
supposed
to
do
maybe
still
a
decent
enough
worldviewbending
tipple
but
yet
not
an
eyeopener
meh
so
sad
to
um
say
pours
a
copperamber
colour
with
thick
white
head
nice
head
retention
as
it
lasts
all
the
way
down
the
glass
some
mild
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
quite
bready
with
lots
of
caramel
and
mild
earthy
hops
nice
sweetness
level
with
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
mouhtfeel
a
very
sessionable
esb
maybe
a
bit
heavy
on
the
tongue
and
stomach
as
a
session
beer
but
highly
enjoyable
and
something
ill
be
sure
to
get
more
of
have
had
this
many
times
but
wasnt
really
feeling
this
bottle
will
review
again
sometime
d
overall
a
very
tasty
offering
from
propeller
this
stuff
is
easily
drinkable
and
is
super
flavourful
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
esbs
d
very
full
flavours
but
with
a
great
malthop
balance
very
easy
and
pleasurable
to
consume
again
and
again
overall
propeller
has
really
accomplished
the
goal
of
making
a
true
englishstyle
esb
overall
nothing
complex
here
just
a
nice
balanced
and
bitter
pud
ale
worth
trying
drink
a
nice
esb
that
im
happy
i
had
the
chance
to
try
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
id
drink
it
again
anytime
taste
is
that
of
a
traditional
esb
bitter
with
a
malty
feel
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
not
a
heavy
beer
and
quite
drinkable
i
would
have
this
again
bomber
from
the
nslc
store
in
wolfville
nova
scotia
on
our
way
around
the
bay
lots
of
healthy
lacing
sits
around
in
the
glass
of
this
amber
colored
beer
the
beer
has
a
huge
aroma
especially
when
you
consider
the
size
of
it
theres
the
diacetyl
toffee
and
generous
amounts
of
malts
and
sweet
bread
it
seems
like
a
bock
mixed
with
esb
more
so
in
the
taste
ale
yeast
diacetyl
a
kiss
of
fruity
esters
a
lightly
hopped
note
bread
crust
and
dont
forget
the
huge
maltiness
present
and
accounted
for
a
little
crisp
in
the
mouth
malty
chewy
tasty
i
like
it
d
a
very
solid
esb
and
one
that
id
be
happy
to
have
again
im
glad
i
revisited
this
beer
now
that
im
more
familiar
with
the
style
d
nice
lacing
and
a
great
smell
it
pours
a
very
luscious
head
and
displays
a
sultry
rubyamber
body
you
can
smell
the
hops
and
some
gently
roasted
malt
deeply
bitter
with
a
lot
of
flavour
washing
over
the
palette
it
ends
with
a
distinct
bitterness
and
scotchiness
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
very
happy
with
this
brew
glad
i
have
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
to
get
through
ill
be
back
for
this
brew
again
i
can
definitely
see
myself
drinking
this
esb
for
an
entire
evening
even
if
the
lcbos
improper
handling
of
this
beer
has
sucked
some
of
the
life
out
of
it
propeller
esb
is
an
excellent
offering
a
nicely
nuanced
britishstyle
quaffer
with
enough
complexity
on
the
one
hand
and
malt
flavour
on
the
other
to
satisfy
both
experienced
beer
nerds
and
micro
newbs
alike
this
is
going
to
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
nice
beer
another
hidden
gem
from
the
east
coast
and
a
big
thanks
to
long813
for
this
one
at
one
point
i
could
buy
this
in
alberta
but
at
20
for
6
i
dont
think
i
ever
did
had
i
known
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
this
much
i
may
have
d
the
bitterness
is
not
profound
and
seems
to
be
very
well
balanced
i
can
and
will
buy
many
of
these
for
sessions
an
underrated
brew
in
my
opinion
tastes
of
mildmedium
hop
bitterness
malts
and
a
bit
of
fruits
well
balanced
and
a
good
drinkable
beer
overall
fantastic
i
recommend
everyone
coming
for
a
visit
to
halifax
nova

for
some
excellent
beer
and
maritime
hospitality

decently
balanced
but
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
fairly
drinkable
but
a
touch
light
in
body
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
perhaps
it
hasnt
aged
the
best
in
my
fridge
and
i
would
recommend
it
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
exceptional
though
by
any
means
certainly
if
you
are
in
the
area
pick
up
one
for
yourself
after
sampling
many
many
different
beers
from
a
respective
style
you
like
to
think
youve
got
a
handle
on
what
that
type
of
beer
should
ideally
taste
like
every
so
often
however
something
like
this
comes
along
and
just
turns
everything
on
its
head
no
this
is
what
esb
should
taste
like
i
can
hear
the
brewmaster
utter
from
up
on
high
im
not
one
to
make
brash
statements
but
this
is
frickin
fantastic
its
the
brewerys
best
seller
for
a
reason
decent
example
of
the
style
not
somthing
id
seek
out
but
not
a
terrible
beer
either
lighten
up
on
some
of
those
salty
off
notes
and
this
would
be
a
real
winner
doh
man
i
could
have
these
all
night
long
my
only
regret
is
that
i
only
bought
a

not

i
would
rave
about
if
these
were
available
in
ontario
id
add
them
to
the
shopping
cart
right
next
to
fullers
as
a
summer
esb
overall
a
decent
brew
from
propeller
with
fullers
esb
being
my
only
other
esb
ive
had
prior
to
this
i
had
somewhat
high
expectations
the
malt
presence
was
very
nice
but
i
couldnt
get
into
the
grassy
hops
that
the
malt
was
being
followed
by
nothing
seemed
to
have
stood
out
about
this
brew
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
but
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
at
the
same
time
i
would
recommend
this
for
anyone
down
in
nova
scotia
interested
in
trying
some
crafts
da
nice
brew
full
of
spicy
bitterness
and
caramel
maltiness
this
is
a
flavourful
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
poured
into
a
mug
as
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
two
fingers
of
head
head
had
decent
staying
power
and
left
plenty
of
lacing
a
slightly
pleasant
sweet
smell
which
accompanies
the
slightly
sweet
taste
slightly
earthy
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
not
quite
as
bitter
as
i
expected
with
minimal
carbonation
turns
it
into
a
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
special
bitter
this
is
much
to
big
to
slam
back
quickly
pace
yourself
and
enjoy
a
decent
offering
and
mild
enough
to
stay
true
to
the
original
style
a
fuller
mouthfeel
would
manage
to
turn
it
up
a
notch
but
it
still
makes
a
decent
session
beer
as
it
presently
is
plus
it
gets
hipster
points
for
being
in
the
trailer
park
boys
movie
as
was
previously
mentioned
i
was
slightly
underwhelmed
by
this
east
coast
brew
that
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
for
quite
some
time
the
flavour
seemed
a
little
subdued
and
no
one
element
really
pushed
it
towards
greatness
dark
orange
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
head
providing
some
lacing
on
the
way
down
caramel
malt
and
grassy
hops
in
the
aroma
much
the
same
in
the
flavour
along
with
some
light
fruity
esters
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
suggested
or
as
bitter
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
wellbalanced
nonetheless
the
focus
seems
to
be
more
on
the
malt
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
easily
drinkable
colour
is
hazy
brown
with
some
red
and
orange
hues
plenty
of
offwhite
head
develops
reducing
to
a
thin
ring
and
haze
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
smells
of
caramel
roasted
malts
and
florals
taste
is
a
mellow
caramel
more
smooth
and
roasted
than
cloying
with
hints
of
bitterness
balancing
throughout
sweet
on
the
finish
full
bodied
but
low
carbonation
feel
makes
it
smooth
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
while
not
the
epitome
of
a
session
beer
its
one
of
my
faithful
standbys
and
its
not
hard
to
see
why
this
decent
brew
is
according
to
the
bottle
propellers
best
seller
really
rather
dark
for
a
bitter
usually
has
a
halfinch
of
fairly
creamy
tan
head
on
it
smell
is
rich
malt
some
dark
crystal
complexity
a
touch
of
chocolate
a
touch
of
mild
grassy
hops
flavour
is
dominated
by
toasty
malt
with
balanced
bitterness
water
doctoring
is
often
too
obvious
with
a
slightly
chemically
sulfate
bite
sometimes
apparent
i
docked
it
for
mouthfeel
it
does
crisp
up
the
bitterness
nicely
though
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
mercifully
easy
to
find
on
draught
in
halifax
this
is
a
decent
esb
it
wont
floor
you
or
clear
you
a
path
to
elightenment
but
it
did
the
trick
and
was
clean
and
crisp
thanks
to
mmansfield
for
the
bottle
i
really
enjoy
this
esb
because
it
has
backbone
and
plenty
of
flavour
a
dark
colour
for
the
style
with
a
nice
hoppy
nose
this
beer
exudes
hops
but
backs
it
up
with
a
malt
backbone
nice
example
of
a
canadian
bitter
with
an
upfront
flavour
profile
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
this
is
definitely
a
beer
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
were
it
available
locally
drinkability

quaffable
as
any
great
beer
ive
tasted
this
is
easily
savored
but
could
be
used
in
a
session
as
well
what
a
session
that
would
be
i
cant
keep
this
beer
in
the
glass
it
seems
to
beg
another
sip
before
you
can
even
put
it
down
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
could
down
a
six
pack
of
this
in
one
sitting
and
still
be
pleased
by
the
taste
i
am
probably
a
bit
biased
but
beer
always
tastes
better
when
there
is
a
story
behind
acquirng
it
the
anticipation
and
waiting
for
it
to
cross
the
country
makes
it
taste
even
better
d
this
is
easy
i
will
have
another
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
easily
one
of
my
favourite
canadian
esbs
i
had
a
couple
bottles
of
this
one
the
last
time
that
i
was
in
newfoundland
its
a
nice
looking
esb
golden
amber
coloured
brew
with
a
pretty
thick
cap
of
white
foam
aromas
are
british
styled
esb
notes
fruity
hops
a
little
buttery
with
a
nice
backbone
of
supporting
malts
chewy
and
bready
and
not
too
sweet
but
certainly
not
hoppy
what
canadian
beer
is
taste
is
sweet
but
leafy
and
totally
passable
mouthfeel
is
good
in
a
medium
bodied
kinda
way
drinkability
is
good
as
well
solid
on
all
accounts
but
nothing
mind
blowing
in
my
opinion
there
is
a
bit
too
much
of
the
carastan
25
in
this
beer
when
it
would
be
left
out
the
beer
becomes
more
drinkable
and
would
fall
into
the
esb
catagory
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
orangecopper
colour
with
a
wispy
white
head
a
huge
malt
aroma
very
pleasant
taste
of
caramel
candy
and
is
very
sweet
finishes
quite
clean
not
much
lingering
after
taste
has
an
element
of
dark
fruit
to
it
not
too
bitter
and
very
drinkable
quite
a
nice
beer
from
propeller
edit
im
not
its
really
quite
different
recognizable
as
being
the
same
beer
only
if
youre
trying
to
find
the
similarities
final
statement
fantastic
brew
one
of
the
best
session
ales
around
highly
recommend
brought
this
back
from
newfoundland
in
2006
341
ml
bottle
with
a
simple
label
showing
the
propeller
same
on
the
cap
this
poured
into
my
glass
forming
a
perfectly
sized
creamwhite
head
with
just
enough
compactness
not
to
spill
over
the
top
tight
little
bubbles
churned
slowly
while
the
head
dimples
and
stays
very
thick
for
the
longest
time
without
sipping
the
head
flattens
eventually
and
looks
like
a
widgetcan
pour
magnificent
the
lacing
is
extremely
viscous
and
hardens
like
meringue
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
warm
deep
tawnyredchestnut
brown
colour
an
exceptional
looking
esb
licorice
root
beer
cappuccino
and
cream
when
i
first
smell
the
beer
the
aroma
is
quite
spicy
like
sprigs
of
pine
or
tree
bark
the
hopping
adds
to
that
and
adds
a
grassy
note
nice
roasted
malts
with
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
toasted
wholegrain
bread
some
of
the
aromas
almost
suggest
a
subdued
barleywine
strong
oily
meaty
malts
in
this
esb
the
taste
at
first
is
all
about
the
heavy
malting
burnt
bread
being
the
dominant
flavour
at
first
the
middle
balances
that
out
with
some
creaminess
and
the
bittering
of
the
hops
and
by
the
finish
the
hops
are
not
so
much
tasted
but
felt
wonderfully
dry
aftertaste
in
the
middle
are
hints
of
root
beer
roast
beef
black
licorice
coffee
and
very
grainy
bread
the
malts
are
actually
quite
dusty
making
the
finish
all
the
more
dry
and
limiting
drinkability
a
little
for
me
personally
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
low
in
carbonation
and
full
a
really
splendid
esb
from
nova
scotia
and
it
would
be
a
regular
of
mine
if
it
were
available
here
in
alberta
well
balanced
although
very
dry
and
grainy
on
the
finish
still
a
great
beer
to
quaff
taste
is
full
of
dark
roasted
caramel
malts
and
a
very
well
balanced
hop
bitterness
some
dark
fruitiness
as
well
plums
particularly
this
is
an
extremely
pleasant
brew
good
thick
full
mouthfeel
feisty
carbonation
on
the
tongue
dry
and
sticky

the

this

i
could

this
a

and
a
great
compliment
to
the
year
round
session

now
grace

ill
be
putting
a
dozen
of
these
bombers
in
the
cellar
taste
is
akin
to
fullers
esb
but
with
considerably
more
malts
very
tasty
but
a
bit
too
malty
for
an
esb
regardless
this
is
an
easy
drinking
excellent
beer
dark

just
short
of

light
citrusy

bitterness
is
forward

well
balanced
with
some
caramel
and
the
roasted
malt
character
that
dominates
the
aroma
fruitiness
appears
as
it
warms
mostly
apple
the
dryness
at
the
finish
is
contributed
by
hops
and
dark
grains
with
roasted
carrying
all
the
way
through
some
lacing
good
head
retention
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
of
average
but
makes
its
presence
felt
in
the
texture
i
like
this
one
good
combination
of
aromas
and
flavours
without
things
getting
too
crazy
and
the
roasted
malt
was
a
pleasant
surprise
tastes
of
burnt
caramel
and
lemon
peel
with
a
hoppy
celery
finish
toned
with
copper
has
a
very
good
balance
between
the
bitter
and
malt
hitting
some
of
the
same
malty
notes
as
the
london
porter
that
propeller
has
brewed
i
find
the
roasted
malt
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
im
used
to
with
a
bitter
but
i
like
it
quite
nice
taste
caramel
malt
not
as
bitter
as
i
thought
it
would
be
in
fact
the
finish
was
rather
sweet
and
with
its
low
carbonation
it
almost
made
me
think
of
an
alt
or
maybe
its
just
me
craving
an
alt
pretty
good
beer
altogether
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
punch
and
maybe
a
bit
more
biscuit
bitter
all
right
your
session
ale
medium
mouthfeel
not
a
top
english
esb
but
quite
nice
balanced
with
flavourful
food
nice
dark
colour
nice
carbonation
drinkable
for
its
style
easy
mouthfeel
bit
of
raspberry
liquorish
make
note
of
the
refrigeration
clause
recommended
this
is
a
well
crafted
ale
certainly
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
if
you
like
english
style
brown
ales
this
one
is
for
you
as
a
bitter
or
esb
this
does
not
succeed
i
plan
to
contact
the
brewery
with
some
queries
about
the
change
of
styles
in
the
past
year
i
like
this
bitter
it
could
be
paler
and
dryer
but
its
still
excellect
so
much
thicker
and
richer
than
most
ontario
micros
this
ones
a
treat
if
you
can
find
it
recommended
pours
out
a
rust
colour
red
yet
is
surprisingly
transparent
nice
head
that
stays
around
until
the
end
very
tan
in
colour
not
a
lot
of
lacing
what
a
great
nose
hops
dark
roasted
ganongs
chocolates
and
it
all
gives
way
to
a
mouthfeel
of
thick
tasty
black
licorce
i
do
like
this
beer
aftertaste
is
my
thing
and
this
has
thing
i
love
it
it
screams
down
the
throat
lots
of
strong
malt
and
maybe
some
real
tangy
orange
man
this
is
good
very
difficult
to
put
down
impressive

hmmmm
its
december
23
and
it
still
tastes
great
used
to
drinking
this
in
my
college
town
basement
bar
whenever
it
would
drop
into
town
this
beer
has
got
the
flavors
i
love
in
a
beer
it
has
the
toastiness
of
fat
tire
and
the
hop
flavor
of
an
apa
i
wish
i
could
get
it
year
around
clear
amber
nice
head
weird
malt
flavors
like
fat
tire
and
dirty
earthy
hops

secret
beer
in
my
new
belgium
12
pack
interestingly
it
seems
like
every
time
i
have
this
beer
i
notice
more
going
on
than
i
did
the
previous
timethe
first
time
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
had
difficulty
distinguishing
different
flavors
the
second
time
i
could
tell
there
was
both
a
nutty
taste
and
a
vague
something
else
must
be
hops
going
on
and
now
on
my
third
bottle
im
noticing
all
kinds
of
smaller
details
i
never
really
did
before
its
so
odd
how
this
one
didnt
really
stand
out
to
me
much
on
my
first
bottle
but
by
the
third
bottle
it
might
just
be
my
secondfavorite
beer
from
the
variety
pack
im
hoping
that
trend
continues
as
i
still
have
one
more
left
in
the
fridge
o
great
for
sitting
by
the
fire
in
yuletide
a
12
oz
bottle
a
light
terracotta
liquid
with
a
creme
fresh
head
light
toasted
biscuits
and
mild
belgofunk
fruitiness
toffee
tinged
sweetness
herbaceous
hops
taste
follows
like
a
winters
fat
tire
well
balanced
malt
body
with
a
dry
graininess
light
caramel
sweetness
herbal
earthiness
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
clinging
to
my
palate
feel
is
nicely
weighted
for
winter
with
a
light
creaminess
smooth
and
drinkable
it
is
a
satisfying
and
delicious
brew
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
pours
a
bright
shiny
gold
that
is
so
clear
head
is
real
nice
and
marshmallowy
lacing
is
some
of
the
best
i
have
ever
seen
hops
hit
the
nose
first
followed
by
some
sweet
malts
taste
hits
first
with
the
malt
of
a
bitter
then
finishes
real
nice
with
the
sterling
and
liberty
hops
creating
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
not
quite
like
any
other
esb
i
have
had
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
not
sure
what
is
really
winter
about
it
but
its
a
decent
enough
brew
it
has
an
esbbitter
character
about
it
and
on
the
hoppy
side
but
it
just
didnt
mesh
well
together
enough
to
be
anything
great
in
my
opinion
still
in
all
glad
enough
it
was
in
the
winter
variety
pack
and
to
have
had
four
bottles
of
it
this
isnt
my
favorite
winter
warmer
simply
because
its
kind
of
light
but
still
somehow
too
bitter
for
my
taste
if
you
like
that
then
give
it
a
shot
but
i
prefer
other
winter
seasonals
more

overall
for
whatever
reason
i
just
personally
like
alot
of
the
typical
new
belgian
flavors
that
i
find
from
the
similar
yeast
and
malt
profiles
used
in
their
beers
at
least
it
certainly
tastes
like
it
this
in
many
ways
is
like
an
amped
up
fat
tire
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
in
my
book
i
believe
this
is
a
seasonal
release
check
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
an
excellent
bitter
perfect
for
the
winter

o
a
good
beer
but
a
little
disappointing
to
me
when
billed
as
a
winter
warmeresb
i
think
it
could
use
more
malt
presence
to
provide
balance
and
complexity
still
it
is
clean
wellmade
and
enjoyable
a
decent
try
o
one
of
the
less
impressive
esbs
ive
had
it
really
is
a
difficult
style
to
nail
properly
and
bring
out
the
subtle
nuances
nothing
offensive
going
on
though
so
it
doesnt
lose
out
on
too
many
points
if
handed
this
at
a
party
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
would
not
pay
money
for
it
a
second
time
overall
i
love
that
nb
is
bringing
back
their
seasonals
and
this
beer
had
a
special
place
for
me
before
every
winter
not
a
horrible
beer
but
there
are
lots
of
better
winter
beers
this
beer
was
all
over
the
place
i
originally
dug
it
but
it
became
too
much
like
a
toneddown
rampant
imperial
ale
i
settled
on
a
3
75
overall
rating
but
it
probably
should
have
been
a
3
50
i
like
this
looks
bland
but
surprises
you
after
every
sip
a
good
bitter
beer
bready
did
i
already
say
that
i
like
the
apple
notes
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
be
happy

very
good
beer
new
belgium
is
a
brewery
that
is
hot
and
cold
with
me
but
with
this
beer
it
is
running
hot
in
spite
of
its
name
great
blending
of
hops
and
malt
and
just
a
drinkable
and
sessionable
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
and
would
love
to
find
it
on
tap
o
enjoyable
and
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
winter
evening
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
stronger
version
of
the
beers
i
would
drink
on
cask
in
the
uk
when
i
was
getting
something
stronger
nice
flavors
i
dont
see
this
as
a
particularly
wintery
seasonal
beer
but
it
is
a
solid
tasty
esb
happy
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
it
o
overall
its
ok
but
nothing
special
ill
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
other
3
that
were
in
the
sampler
but
i
dont
think
id
but
it
again
pours
out
a
nice
dark
orange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
fairly
good
retention
smells
of
fruit
i
get
some
pineapple
and
orange
when
i
think
of
what
sticks
out
actually
smells
fairly
nice
taste
is
pretty
mellow
and
turned
down
definitely
a
session
beer
as
i
bought
it
for
that
not
very
hoppy
at
all
i
definitely
get
more
from
the
malt
bill
here
taste
is
hard
for
me
to
pin
down
but
malt
forward
and
not
very
hoppy
its
very
drinkable
wish
i
could
get
more
out
of
this
but
its
not
a
big
beer
like
im
used
to
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
but
it
seems
well
for
the
style
overall
a
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
basically
a
good
session
beer
overall
a
decent
approximation
to
a
bitter
or
esb
or
whatever
new
belgium
is
marketing
this
as
i
would
classify
it
as
a
more
hopforward
version
of
fat
tire
which
is
difficult
enough
to
classify
by
itself
i
might
have
this
again
but
with
bass
being
so
cheap
id
probably
stick
to
the
authentic
english
pub
beers
o
this
winter
ale
has
a
ton
of
hop
character
and
big
malt
backbone
that
really
balance
each
other
out
well
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
much
maltier
version
of
celebration
ale
it
seemed
like
the
hop
profile
and
hop
bite
was
pretty
similar
o
again
this
reminded
me
of
fat
tire
but
perhaps
a
lighter
version
i
do
enjoy
fat
tire
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
original
to
this
version
i
got
this
as
part
of
the
nb
winter
12
pack
foam
was
white
in
color
thin
and
a
little
lacey
it
had
a
dominate
hops
and
citrus
aroma
with
hints
of
anise
and
wheat
the
color
was
a
beautiful
orange
amber
the
taste
was
a
complete
translation
of
the
smell
a
complete
balance
of
hops
and
citrus
with
spices
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
crisp
drinkability
not
to
bad
to
me
a
simple
balance
of
hops
and
citrus
with
some
added
flavors
ok
session
friend
walks
in
with
a
growler
of
this
fresh
from
the
mountains
i
jumps
up
and
downs
und
serve
it
in
my
2
pinter
that
looketh
like
the
one
pinter
beer
has
traveled
15
hours
and
3
finger
head
with
a
shit
ton
of
lacing
that
lasts
the
whole
day
through
i
mean
the
whole
glass
through
nice
copper
body
with
perfect
clarity
sterling
and
liberty
hops
with
nice
roasted
malty
warmth
fill
the
nostrildomis
i
predict
this
motherfucker
is
gonna
taste
yummier
than
chuck
it
does
the
hops
and
malts
are
balanced
pretty
near
perfectly
enough
dry
hopping
that
brings
the
horsehoofed
malt
taste
away
and
finishes
with
a
super
nice
bright
and
dry
christmas
green
hop
gremlin
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
nicely
carbonated
again
balancing
the
malt
hop
bitterness
a
great
present
from
a
special
fwend
overall
the
beer
is
mild
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
choice
for
this
fairly
warm
evening
reviewed

this
pleases
the
pale
aleipa
lover
in
me
but
my
taste
buds
are
yearning
for
darker
malts
when
you
say
winter
ale
however
as
i
strive
to
judge
beers
on
their
own
versus
what
i
wish
they
were
its
hard
to
really
complain
overall
i
didnt
like
very
much
but
didnt
hate
either
its
one
of
those
in
general
not
a
bad
beer
from
a
good
brewer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
fine
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
nothing
sectacular
but
still
a
very
good
i
would
recommend
trying
this
if
the
chance
arises
a
fairly
decent
drinker
but
probably
not
one
i
will
await
with
bated
breath
next
winter
d
very
easy
to
drink
because
it
isnt
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
rich
overall
a
well
made
beer
a
lawnmower
beer
for
the
wintertime
my
guess
is
that
this
one
will
be
a
love
it
of
hate
it
for
bas
it
had
me
at
hello
and
then
lost
me
in
too
many
competing
flavors
overall
this
is
an
excellent
winter
seasonal
and
it
took
me
many
trips
to
the
store
before
i
finally
picked
up
a
six
pack
needless
to
say
i
drank
the
whole
thing
without
any
difficulty
and
was
very
glad
to
have
finally
tried
2
below
out
drink
this
beer
good
bitter
ale
not
great
but
very
good
worth
trying
sort
of
mild
c
good
esb
d
the
aforementioned
body
does
not
serve
it
well
here
as
it
sits
on
the
stomach
strange
could
only
have
two
overall
hoppy
winter
warmer
interesting
beer
its
a
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
having
in
the
winter
in
a
sampler
pack
of
winter
beers
it
will
stand
out
and
add
to
the
batch
dont
know
is
i
would
classify
this
as
an
extraspecial
or
strong
bitter
give
it
a
try
orange
in
color
pretty
clear
with
some
bubbling
the
head
is
sticky
and
fairly
tall
for
its
style
with
a
pleasant
craggy
recession
glass
lacing
is
minimal
aromatic
with
the
nose
deep
in
the
glass
somewhat
toasted
barley
note
with
an
herbal
hop
character
the
flavor
is
pretty
mild
lead
by
a
toasted
barley
and
general
earthiness
hopping
is
quite
faint
and
somewhat
herbal
a
little
too
faint
in
the
mouth
and
light
overall
to
make
a
good
impression
well
balanced
enjoyed
this
one
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
looks
great
smells
good
and
drinks
very
easy
d
this
is
a
very
nice
esb
and
one
that
i
will
seek
out
again
this
beer
i
have
seen
on
tap
but
never
tried
it
i
went
to
the
beer
store
and
saw
that
it
was
available
in
bottles
and
decided
to
pick
it
up
the
semell
is
fairly
hoppy
an
to
my
surprise
is
pretty
drinkalbe
it
leave
no
aftertaste
and
is
has
a
really
good
moutjfeel
this
is
a
light
but
not
to
light
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
had
some
of
these
during
christmas
and
was
blown
away
nice
hop
flavor
and
use
of
light
spices
i
then
saved
a
bottle
for
now
about
2
12
months
later
im
not
sure
if
it
went
bad
despite
the
bottles
date
being
fresh
i
really
did
like
it
which
is
why
my
review
is
above
average
i
felt
like
it
was
a
lighter
bodied
more
hoppy
fat
tire
ill
be
sure
to
buy
it
again
next
year
and
also
compare
it
to
this
batch
like
i
said
the
last
ones
i
had
werent
watery
at
all
for
those
who
say
hoppy
winter
beer
try
sierra
nevada
celebration
very
roasty
malty
flavor
finishes
with
a
light
dryness
clean
and
smooth
going
down
not
chalky
at
all
notes
of
subtle
spice
hard
for
me
to
distinguish
any
real
predominant
flavor
maybe
its
to
well
balanced
d
a
nice
winter
beer
as
advertised
i
would
gladly
enjoy
another
bottle
although
it
is
not
spectacular
appearance
is
pretty
awful
for
a
winter
beer
its
almost
transparent
not
much
going
on
in
the
look
it
is
a
dark
orange
color
nice
head
though
the
head
is
the
only
redeeming
quality
the
head
is
fading
quickly
however
looks
like
it
might
be
leaving
good
lacing
the
smell
is
hoppy
hoppier
than
i
would
expect
a
winter
beer
to
be
in
the
back
end
of
the
smell
you
get
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
malt
sweetness
not
a
bad
smell
though
pretty
good
actually
wow
the
taste
is
interesting
it
tastes
a
little
watery
with
the
hops
trying
to
cover
it
up
i
know
that
doesnt
make
much
sense
but
bare
with
me
like
the
body
is
really
thin
and
watery
and
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
too
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
very
present
hop
bite
not
much
malt
at
all
you
get
a
tiny
tiny
bit
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
would
expect
in
a
winter
beer
you
do
however
get
some
of
that
winter
warmer
warmth
from
this
beer
which
is
nice
you
also
get
a
taste
of
spices
drinkability
is
average
nothing
special
there
overall
an
average
beer
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with

picked
up
aroma
of

and
and
toasted
white
bread
starts
out
with
a
dominant
toasted
malt
bread
bisquit
and
maybe
wild

caramel
flavor
has
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
will
continue
throughout
with
that
trademark
toasted
bread
malt
backbone
nice
dry
hopped
aroma
of
orange
but
flat
finish
not
something
i
would
pick
up
often
but
i
was
a
good
break
from
my
stout
and
porter
stint
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
with
an
american
hop
touch
good
to
sip
next
to
a
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
a
great
mix
that
amply
combines
the
best
attributes
of
a
pale
ale
with
a
belgian
seasonal
lovely
and
delicious
fourthbeer
potential
average
as
there
are
other
good
esbs
but
this
is
worthy
of
the
new
belgium
name
d
a
mediocre
pale
ale
from
new
belgium
this
beer
exchanges
some
of
the
more
assertive
hop
flavors
present
in
their
other
seasonals
for
a
doubledose
of
fermentationfrom
mixed
fruit
to
detectable
alcohol
the
final
product
isnt
really
remarkable
coming
across
as
a
fruity
version
of
boston
lager
but
it
might
make
a
good
cooking
ingredient
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
more
of
a
higher
end
abv
sessionish
beer
for
me
not
something
i
would
savor
of
course
more
something
me
and
my
friends
might
share
a
case
of
at
a
winter
bbq
the
malt
is
super
complex
with
variations
of
breads
cracker
and
simple
caramel
to
make
this
beer
a
standout
the
hops
play
their
role
but
dont
get
in
the
way
of
the
excellent
malts
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
esbs
or
any
beer
i
cant
say
enough
about
the
malt
profile
had
this
one
at
happy
hour
at
a
bbq
spot
in
the
northwest
denver
recently
and
thought
it
was
pretty
solid
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
somewhat
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
floral
hops
and
caramel
medium
bodied
somewhat
hoppy
with
toffee
and
caramel
on
the
finish
d
this
is
a
very
sessionable
brew
for
the
abv
content
and
the
light
bodied
taste
i
find
this
one
to
clear
out
of
my
fridge
quick
that
says
something
about
drinkability
foam
was
white
in
color
thin
and
a
little
lacey
it
had
a
dominate
hops
and
citrus
aroma
with
hints
of
anise
and
wheat
the
color
was
a
beautiful
orange
amber
the
taste
was
a
complete
translation
of
the
smell
a
complete
balance
of
hops
and
citrus
with
spices
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
crisp
drinkability
not
to
bad
to
me
a
simple
balance
of
hops
and
citrus
with
some
added
flavors
ok
session
d
it
is
very
well
balanced
reminds
me
of
an
apa
d
nice
for
a
winter
session
a
very
smooth
and
surprisingly
noy
bitter
for
a
bitter
style
beer
great
lacing
color
is
amberlight
copper
some
good
grain
mild
hops
flavor
is
noy
unlike
a
regular
amber
ale
with
less
spice
a
bit
less
hop
punch
good
body
and
carbonation
quite
tasty
but
not
a
spectacular
example
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
suggest
it
if
you
like
a
fairly
strong
hoppiness
its
nothing
compared
to
some
hop
bomb
ipas
or
double
ipas
but
its
an
enjoyable
brew
that
accents
one
of
beers
great
ingredients
d
very
drinkable
with
its
pleasant
taste
and
fair
crispness
the
abv
might
keep
it
lower
d
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
d
good
but
not
great
another
esb
that
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
bar
fullers
has
set
this
oddly
reminds
me
a
lot
of
southern
tier
phin
and
matts
extraordinary
ale
d
drinkable
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
nothing
amazing
but
a
solid
offering
i
remember
it
being
more
bitter
in
years
past
as
this
bottle
seemed
a
bit
sweeter
than
in
years
past
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
biscuity
malt
flavor
that
most
of
new
belgiums
beers
have
d
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
this
was
very
good
on
tap
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
overall
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
just
not
up
to
par
with
what
i
hold
nb
to
doesnt
taste
like
a
winter
warmer
to
me
at
all
go
for
it
if
its
at
a
party
or
youre
really
curious
but
definitely
no
reason
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
some
this
is
not
a
winter
warmer
some
may
be
expecting
that
but
it
is
in
fact
a
very
nice
winter
ale
devoid
of
many
of
the
spices
some
might
expect
no
cloves
no
nutmeg
and
an
abv
south
of
7
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
revisit
next
winter
light
to
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
nothing
to
special
here
i
will
not
seek
this
out
again
it
is
a
good
session
beer
that
is
not
particularly
strong
or
bitter
at
all
orangeamber
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
hoppy
i
get
some
pine
and
grassy
hops
as
well
as
some
toffee
malt
the
flavor
is
much
maltier
than
the
aroma
i
get
a
bunch
of
toffee
and
some
nuttyness
as
well
as
some
grassy
hops
very
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice

extra
special
bitter
that
is

to
see
a

ale
that
isnt
full
of

more

there

the

i

its

this

pours
a

by
a

offecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
light
grapefruit
white
grapes
light
lemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
sugary
caramel
the
taste
doesnt
deviate
too
far
from
this
appointed
route
though
the
caramel
is
stronger
acting
as
a
nice
chassis
for
the
fruitier
notes
and
the

also
accentuate
themselves
the
body
is
fairly
light
with

a

i
couldnt

myself
drinking
more
than
a

it

good

not

to
keep
me
wanting
more

drinkability
i
got
this
in
there
winter
mix
12
pack
and
the
2
below
is
always
the
first
to
go
one
my
favorite
new
belgium
beers
probably
behind
abbey
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
that
i
could
probably
drink
5
or
6
of
and
forget
that
it
was
6
6
i
sure
wish
new
belgium
distributed
to
pennsylvania
md
not
sure
about
this
beer
being
an
esb
there
isnt
much
fruity
flavors
to
justify
that
label
still
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
once
for
the
unique
hop
flavors
nice
beer
good
brewery
some
seem
to
shine
on
drinkable
others
on
big
beers
new
belgium
seems
strong
on
the
former
d
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
definitely
a
decent
esb
perhaps
a
bit
light
in
body
though
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
its
not
really
marketed
as
an
esb
more
like
session
ice
beer
however
the
esb
style
seems
to
fit
it
is
quite
tasty
regardless
of
the
context
and
it
does
go
down
easy
it
perhaps
lacks
a
little
complexity
to
be
truly
outstanding
but
it
is
well
done
not
bad
not
great
to
me
lacks
the
body
of
a
true
esb
although
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
close
served
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
good
lacing
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
aroma
is
malt
a
bit
nutty
toffee
caramel
flavor
is
like
aroma
body
is
good
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
short
to
medium
length
better
review
for
closer
to
style
very
nice
session
beer
with
all
the
right
bitterness
that
youd
like
to
see
out
of
an
esb
all
around
well
done
this
is
a
nice
variation
within
the
brand
and
of
similar
consistency
and
quality
based
on
the
ones
i
have
had
so
far
i
would
order
this
before
some
of
the
other
nb
brews
but
i
still
liked
the
hoptoberfest
from
nb
more
i
think
we
cant
find
any
more
so
it
must
be
the
season
has
ended
for
nb
hoptoberfest
this
year
d
initially
enjoyed
the
hops
and
bitterness
on
the
way
in
regretted
the
thick
and
sticky
aftertaste
overall
it
had
the
look
and
smell
of
a
good
esb
and
enough
abv
to
do
some
damage
but
just
a
tad
sweet
to
really
go
nuts
on
drinkability
quite
decent
brew
not
terribly
complex
but
a
good
taste
in
general
clear
copper
with
a
thin
bone
colored
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
herbal
hops
with
some
bready
malt
notes
caramel
and
bread
crusty
malt
flavors
with
some
nice
earthy
hop
spice
to
keep
it
interesting
medium
light
bodied
with
aggressive
carbonation
a
different
brew
but
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
light
amber
in
color
the
initial
aroma
is
pleasant
but
soon
generates
a
bitter
smell
the
first
taste
goes
down
well
and
the
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
at
all
then
it
almost
develops
a
bitter
taste
with
each
taste
after
that
it
is
a
wellbodied
beer
but
it
is
not
one
high
on
my
list
the
finish
was
good
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
pours
a
bit
thin
in
color
for
a
typical
winter
warmer
but
not
a
bad
light
copper
color
huge
and
wonderful
head
with
great
lacing
throughout
nice
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
orange
peel
and
nutmeg
in
the
nose
very
nice
flavor
a
great
sweet
maltiness
with
wonderful
citrus
and
spices
orange
nutmeg
a
bit
of
cinnamon
is
mostly
what
im
getting
and
maybe
mace
goes
down
very
smoothly
but
with
a
bit
of
a
funky
aftertaste
although
i
cant
tell
if
its
from
hops
or
a
spice
crisp
but
medium
in
body
and
a
little
tart
for
an
esb
but
not
sour
description
but
i
dont
get
any
of
that
at
all
mostly
a
lot
of
roastiness
and
a
little
bit
of
metallic
taste
as
well
just
another
below
average
that
was
a
freebie
from
my
n
belgium
rep
thank
goodness
pretty
decent
beer
out
of
new
belgiums
winter
pack
it
and
1554
are
probably
my
favorite
definitely
some
better
esbs
out
there
that
are
in
the
same
price
range
though
so
not
sure
id
try
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
but
it
was
nice
to
have
in
the
winter
pack
btw
props
to
my
brother
pat
in
california
for
letting
me
know
this
is
a
great
beer
that
packs
a
whollop
brohem
overall
this
is
what
i
might
consider
the
perfect
winterholiday
beer
to
session
this
was
my
first
esb
this
beer
is
even
more
indicative
of
winter
than
magic
hats
howl
it
was
smooth
and
easy
drinking
since
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
i
do
not
have
much
to
say
about
the
appearance
i
will
be
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
seasonal
gem
before
the
winter
is
over
d
two
sips
and
its
already
hitting
me
as
a
bloat
beer
the
flavor
and
experience
isnt
pulling
me
to
withstand
the
bloat
that
i
am
envisioning
d
very
nice
and
complex
mellow
and
nutty
throughout
with
a
slight
sweetness
the
sweet
and
hoppiness
are
very
nicely
balanced
very
good
winter
beer
although
not
very
complex
2
below
provide
the
drinker
with
an
enjoyable
session
due
mostly
to
its
impeccable
balance
and
drink
ability
definitely
a
great
choice
for
fall
and
winter
nights
this
beer
pours
a
light
and
bright
copper
in
color
with
threequarters
inch
of
head
which
laces
the
glass
the
aroma
is
hoppy
brassy
strangely
almost
a
hint
of
fishiness
the
flavor
is
hoppy
firmly
founded
on
a
nice
malt
and
follows
the
aroma
flavorful
yet
light
and
brassy
this
beer
is
intriguing
i
am
interested
to
try
it
again
on
another
day
and
double
check
my
impressions
nice
flavor
starts
with
a
crisp
bitter
mellowed
by
a
sweetness
before
some
grapefruit
and
spicy
hops
roll
in
followed
quickly
by
the
earthiness
from
the
yeast
i
believe
the
hops
linger
on
through
the
end
the
toasty
malt
character
staying
true
too
lots
of
flavor
going
on
mostly
working
well
together
it
actually
might
be
better
a
month
from
now
with
the
hops
mellowed
a
bit
into
the
beer
perhaps
better
integrated
drinkability
is
so
so
with
so
many
other
great
seasonal
beers
out
this
time
of
year
it
would
too
easy
to
pass
this
over
but
the
joy
quickly
fades
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
the
overall
effect
is
a
very
mild
unimpressive
drink
ill
put
away
a
couple
of
these
with
dinner
but
they
arent
a
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
pours
a
very
transparent
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
of
malted
caramel
and
a
little
of
hops
taste
reflects
the
smell
but
has
a
little
bit
of
a
coffee
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
end
that
surprised
me
has
a
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
i
am
still
unsure
what
style
this
beer
is
but
people
who
enjoy
a
winter
beer
with
a
bitter
finish
should
give
it
a
try
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
i
mean
very
drinkable
the
abv
on
the
beer
is
well
hidden
with
the
alcohol
coming
through
more
as
beer
warms
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
very
impressed
drinkability
good
this
is
a
very
nice
beer

leaves
somewhat
of
a
hop
finish
somewhat
floral
but
not
much
lingers
on

is

a

is
the
classic
sense
no
is
it
good
yes
is
it
a
good
beer
for
winter
to
my
tastes
borderline
but
definitely
unique
and
worth
a
try
d
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
worth
getting
to
try
sometime
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
period
of
time
d
ok
what
is
this
beer
it
is
pretty
good
but
what
is
it
ba
says
esb
nb
says
winter
warmer
neither
of
these
really
seems
to
be
spot
on
to
me
it
seems
more
like
an
oktoberfest
done
in
a
big
bad
way
malt
profile
seems
to
have
good
does
of
munich
and
to
be
germanesque
overall
the
hops
are
liberty
and
sterling
hallertau
hybrids
the
bottle
label
describes
a
lagering
process
both
quite
malty
and
quite
bitter
and
bit
toward
the
hefty
side
an
ofest
for
the
after
after
after
after
party
notes
it
doesnt
have
nearly
the
amount
of
flavor
that
i
was
expecting
i
love
esbs
but
this
one
falls
a
little
short
it
is
better
than
average
but
nothing
great
mediumbodied
with
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
not
really
an
exciting
beer
but
its
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
good
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
it
seems
less
malty
and
more
harsh
than
past
years
d
not
bad
a
unique
beer
interesting
combination
of
characteristics
nutty
bitter
and
stronger
than
most
session
beers
o
im
not
sure
if
this
is
not
the
best
stored
bottle
or
not
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
could
be
the
style
too
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
oily
and
leaves
a
slight
cling
d
very
drinkable
would
be
great
for
session
especially
if
a
tap
was
flowing
brownishorange
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
rocky
white
head
the
aroma
isnt
offensive
but
not
all
that
great
either
not
much
complexity
all
i
really
get
is
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
fruity
almost
raspberry
quality
they
lost
me
on
the
first
sip
the
hops
come
through
in
unpleasant
ways
as
far
as
im
concerned
as
theres
an
almost
metallic
bitterness
needs
a
lot
more
malt
to
balance
things
out
the
fruitiness
from
the
aroma
is
still
there
but
it
tastes
like
watered
down
berries
light
body
pretty
unremarkable
mouthfeel
overall
in
general
this
one
was
very
forgettable
and
not
one
that
id
recommend
i
think
even
fat
tire
is
better
than
this
one
and
im
no
fan
of
ft
pick
something
else
i
do
like
the
dry
finish
and
nutty
aftertaste
which
atones
slightly
for
a
flavor
that
leaves
me
wanting
in
all
its
a
nice
accessible
beer
on
the
sweet
end
of
esb
and
really
more
of
a
nice
comfortable
warmer
but
among
winter
seasonals
there
are
far
better
it
would
add
considerably
to
2
below
if
new
belgium
were
to
shovel
in
some
more
malt
and
hops
to
boldly
go
where
nb
had
only
safely
gone
before
with
2
below
i
could
drink
this
all
winter
as
the
mild
hoppiness
suites
my
palate
as
i
drink
it
the
hoppiness
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
some
but
this
still
isnt
hitting
the
spot
for
me
better
than
i
initially
though
but
still
pretty
average
and
i
love
a
good
bitter
or
esb
tastes
like
like
an
amber
ale
with
more
hops
what
more
can
i
say
nothing
spectacular
about
this
interesting
to
drink
seasonally
d
very
easy
to
down
several
of
these
it
had
a
good
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
i
guess
my
biggest
surprise
was
that
this
beer
was
an
esb
one
of
my
favorite
styles
because
i
thought
i
was
buying
a
more
traditional
winter
warmer
even
after
reading
the
label
i
still
didnt
know
this
was
an
esb
after
my
first
taste
i
realized
i
really
liked
this
beer
then
it
dawned
on
me
that
wait
wheres
the
cinnamon
and
spice
this
aint
no
winter
warmer
its
an
esb
sweet
hey
new
belgium
this
needs
to
be
one
of
your
regular
offerings
i
think
ill
grab
a
case
or
2
before
this
is
gone
drinkability
interesting
hybrid
type
beer
i
am
going
to
steal
the
german
esb
term
from
buckeyenation
although
i
like
it
better
than
him
as
it
seems
to
have
marzen
qualities
to
it
it
also
really
seems
as
if
they
add
heather
to
it
good
not
great
beer
overall
if
it
wasnt
for
the
aftertaste
it
would
have
been
better
onto
the
next
beers
in
the
folly
pack
from
nb
d
the
alcohol
is
moderate
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
its
just
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
certainly
not
bad
would
love
some
more
if
it
were
more
readily
available
in
ohio
a
greatly
balanced
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
which
i
would
expect
from
an
esb
but
come
on
where
are
the
hops
man
hop
bill
needs
to
be
reworked
to
get
more
bitterness
aroma
and
flavor
malt
although
tastes
good
needs
to
be
punched
up
a
bit
more
they
have
a
good
base
but
there
needs
to
be
more
of
it
but
i
could
easily
throw
back
4
of
these
while
watching
a
game
or
something
d
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
but
too
average
to
drink
too
many
d
a
drinkable
beer
if
youre
into
esbs
not
a
particularly
complex
brew
but
good
enough
drinkability
i
was
very
suprised
and
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
a
hoerum
but
fefinitly
a
solid
selection
d
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
and
its
never
received
that
well
by
others
all
cause
of
the
hops
the
makings
of
a
good
winter
brew
but
overshadowed
by
grass
clippings
my
opinion
this
will
probably
be
my
last
encounter
with
the
2
below
well
it
was
definitely
nice
to
sit
down
and
review
a
beer
again
after
a
weeks
worth
of
sickness
and
even
nicer
to
start
off
with
a
fine
beer
such
as
this
one
i
look
forward
to
the
days
when
new
belgium
finally
enters
the
philadelphia
market
the
day
will
come
eventually
this
one
may
well
find
its
way
onto
my
shopping
list
when
the
weather
starts
getting
cold
d
pretty
drinkable
maybe
the
most
refreshing
beer
ive
ever
had
the
powerful
citrus
combine
with
the
bitter
hoppy
kick
quenches
a
thirst
like
none
other
drinkability
very
drinkable
poured
into
a
snifter
left
12
offwhite
head
pretty
nice
lacing
going
down
smell
is
very
nice
like
fresh
bread
grains
and
a
good
amount
of
maltiness
wo
being
sweet
taste
is
a
little
surprising
theres
an
unavoidable
artificial
spiciness
that
i
guess
is
supposed
to
be
wintery
not
really
my
bag
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
it
becomes
evident
in
the
smell
i
read
another
review
that
described
the
taste
as
being
like
redhots
candy
that
is
exactly
what
this
tastes
like
eh
mouthfeel
is
medium
typical
carbonation
drinkability
is
soso
if
you
like
this
taste
you
would
want
to
drink
more
i
guess
im
not
a
fan
had
on
tap
at
burger
jones
in
a
12
0z
nb
goblet
the
pour
was
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
fresh
head
and
clinging
lace
the
smell
is
malt
toast
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
is
hops
in
the
mouth
with
some
citrus
some
nice
malts
with
bread
and
toffee
in
the
background
very
crisp
and
fresh
this
is
one
good
winter
seasonal
esb
it
is
on
the
lighter
side
both
in
color
and
taste
none
the
less
is
was
very
good
recommended
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
uninticing
at
times
which
doesnt
bring
me
back
for
another
sip
the
abv
is
moderate
but
well
incorporated
so
it
doesnt
sway
me
either
way
just
a
meh
beer
for
me
drink
ability
was
good
pretty
sessionable
beer
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
pretty
odd
choice
for
a
winter
beer
but
its
a
good
substitute
for
all
the
dark
ales
that
pop
up
this
time
of
the
year
the
palate
opens
mildly
bitter
with
a
combination
of
hop
and
burnt
whole
wheat
toast
bitterness
before
the
brown
sugar
and
a
light
molasses
character
come
in
mildly
spicy
i
swear
i
taste
nutmeg
but
it
could
be
the
combination
of
the
alcohol
and
the
bitterness
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
grainy
astringency
this
mediumlight
bodied
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
solid
stuff
im
not
sure
id
drink
an
awful
lot
though
notes
bbcsd0910timl
not
bad
rather
easy
drinking
beer
quite
drinkable
a
bit
boozy
one
or
two
of
these
on
a
chilly
night
would
be
just
right
im
a
poet
and
i
dont
even
no
it
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
an
esb
and
this
one
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
very
nice
beer
drinkability
is
decent
but
flavor
could
be
better
d
i
was
very
much
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
beer
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
standard
at
all
the
redhot
fake
cinnamon
flavor
was
offputting
which
is
odd
because
not
many
of
the
reviews
for
this
beer
mention
cinnamon
but
thats
definately
what
i
got
out
of
this
kinf
of
a
let
down
unfortunately
pours
a
fairly
orangeamber
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
no
or
minimal
lacing
aroma
has
that
roasty
malty
note
typical
of
new
belgiums
offerings
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
slightly
bready
or
woody
taste
its
decent
but
not
really
exceptional
the
interesting
notes
of
this
brew
can
all
be
found
in
fat
tire
which
is
a
better
beer
all
around
imo
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
for
the
style
but
medium
overall
appropriate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
but
could
be
better
looks
more
like
an
amber
ale
dark
amber
good
carbonation
making
champagne
like
tiny
bubbles
aroma
is
woody
taste
malt
predominance
a
little
hop
presence
that
cant
resonate
on
the
palate
because
of
the
assertiveness
of
the
roasted
malt
wood
flavored
almost
to
the
point
you
would
think
there
was
minimal
aging
inside
such
a
vessel
o
not
my
favorite
from
nb
but
its
harmless
and
enjoyable
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
maltforward
or
scots
styles
i
still
dont
get
the
esb
labeling
try
this
one
with
roasted
almonds
or
maybe
good
mexican
food
got
this
on
draft
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
columbia
sc
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
2finger
light
beige
head
medium
lacing
smell
is
caramel
malts
with
some
grassy
hints
the
taste
a
mix
of
honey
caramel
malts
and
grassy
hops
not
that
bitter
mouthfeel
is
crisp
mediumbodied
this
is
ok
in
the
drinkability
dept
not
as
spicy
as
i
would
have
expected
single
from
whole
foods
cary
if
i
was
not
on
a
mission
of
trying
as
many
bars
as
possible
i
would
have
had
another
but
alas
not
to
knock
new
belgium
too
hard
their
mothership
wit
is
pretty
tasty
keep
at
it
fellas
youre
showing
improvement
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
finebubbled
slightly
orangy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
fruity
and
slightly
spicy
lively
mouthfilling
flavor
is
spicy
with
woody
and
hoppy
undertones
texture
is
tingly
fizzy
and
sassy
definitely
worth
at
least
a
try
not
sure
what
i
would
compare
this
beer
to
in
terms
of
style
but
man
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
tastes
good
thats
what
the
majority
of
beer
drinkers
are
looking
for
isnt
it
pours
a
high
clarity
golden
yellow
maybe
a
hint
of
amber
the
head
is
tight
and
foamy
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
as
well
nose
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
the
hops
are
intermingled
with
the
sweetness
which
is
a
nice
effect
taste
is
also
pretty
sweet
and
sticky
hoppy
not
too
bitter
but
bitter
enough
malt
backdrop
is
nice
as
well
serving
type
bottle
a
seasonal
esb
eh
not
bad
but
unremarkable
solid
contribution
to
the
esb
discussion
poured
into
pint
glass
amber
colored
and
very
clear
with
a
short
white
head
teh
head
fell
away
quickly
smells
of
biscuity
malt
and
lemony
floral
hops
tastes
of
bready
malt
with
strong
hop
finish
well
balances
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
level
of
carbonation
drinkability
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
ok
its
light
bodied
and
has
an
ok
bitterness
and
carbonated
bite
that
being
said
its
only
slightly
above
average
and
doesnt
really
shine
with
true
character
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
a
solid
pleasing
beer
but
nothing
special
worth
trying
but
i
wont
be
buying
again
d
easy
to
drink
not
heavy
like
you
would
expect
from
something
designated
as
a
winter
beer
overall
this
is
a
easily
drinkable
beer
the
abv
is
hidden
and
the
flavors
balance
nicely
it
is
something
i
will
enjoy
a
few
times
but
would
get
tired
of
it
until
the
next
year
comes
d
very
easy
to
sip
on
and
goes
down
quite
fast
d
good
clean
brew
nicely
balanced
and
something
i
could
drink
all
night
good
not
great
but
good
d
no
great
drinkability
i
would
probably
look
for
something
else
new
belgiums
release
in
the
myrtle
beach
area
has
been
marketed
towards
gateway
craft
beer
drinkers
you
dont
expect
any
extreme
hop
blasts
or
malt
bombs
or
alcohol
kicks
with
their
beers
so
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
other
than
a
nice
holiday
beer
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
hops
up
front
with
the
sweet
malt
body
followed
by
a
nice
clean
finish
definately
more
character
than
i
expected
not
too
heavy
and
has
kind
of
a
belgian
trippel
vibe
to
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
is
very
drinkable
all
in
all
a
very
decent
offering
i
actually
thought
it
was
2
below
at
some
point
when
i
was
drinking
this
yes
it
was
cold
outside
actually
i
wasnt
surprised
when
i
read
the
alcohol
content
on
the
side
being
at
6
6
i
could
really
taste
it
at
one
point
and
was
getting
a
little
worried
but
it
got
a
little
smoother
as
i
drank
more
very
nice
brew
if
you
are
fan
of
hops
but
dont
like
to
chew
them
through
your
beer
experience
give
this
a
shot
very
enjoyable
and
recommended
i
prefer
ipas
over
this
so
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
the
sixer
i
have
is
going
to
be
a
pleasant
experience
regardless
another
strong
brew
from
new
belgium
good
for
the
winter
season
it
warms
up
the
gut
this
is
worth
trying
as
a
seasonal
it
would
not
make
my
regular
rotation
it
drinks
easily
for
6
6
abv
notes
much
closer
to
an
ipa
than
i
expected
its
similar
to
sierra
nevada
celebration
but
doesnt
seem
quite
as
balanced
to
me
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
bitterness
and
high
carbonation
the
hoppyness
limits
this
one
for
a
session
beer
one
glass
was
just
fine
with
me
mediumbodied
with
medhigh
carbonation
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
an
ok
offering
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
unibroue
tulip
best
by
march
26
2010
one
inch
of
soapy
fluffy
white
head
rests
for
quite
a
while
atop
a
golden
body
aroma
is
of
of
fresh
piney
hops
and
some
light
sweet
malts
taste
has
some
nice
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
front
and
a
touch
of
sweet
malts
with
some
light
spicing
abv
is
not
noticeable
whatsoever
in
this
extremely
pleasing
winter
ale
extremely
thick
mouthfeel
kinda
strange
in
a
clear
beer
but
noticeably
thick
pretty
nice
beer
across
the
board
pours
a
dark
yellow
light
orange
from
the
bottle
no
haze
at
all
in
the
glass
foamy
head
disappears
fairly
quickly
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
light
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
bubbly
theres
something
interesting
up
front
in
the
taste
that
im
not
sure
how
to
describeits
pleasantly
earth
almost
pungent
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
winter
session
beer
this
would
make
a
good
choice
i
think
d
not
too
harsh
on
the
palate
but
pretty
boring
taste
that
could
use
some
kind
of
a
hop
presence
to
balance
out
the
maltiness
and
breadiness
a
bit
12
oz
fairly
bright
orange
pour
some
white
head
nice
malty
aroma
some
citrus
and
christmas
cookie
taste
has
some
malt
herbal
tones
but
an
overwhelming
cardboard
and
metallic
flavor
finish
kind
of
blah
some
fading
maltyness
body
is
fairly
light
nice
carbonation
though
the
cardboardgrass
like
flavors
are
really
hard
to
get
by
drinkability
tasty
and
overall
nice
but
in
my
mind
more
of
a
spring
of
fall
brew
not
enough
body
and
too
much
hop
for
winter
style
like
a
hoppy
fat
tire
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
even
being
an
esb
when
i
ordered
it
and
more
surprised
at
the
hop
levels
a
solid
if
nontraditional
esb
drink
is
ok
not
a
fave
so
i
wish
i
could
have
bought
a
single
instead
of
a
6
i
remember
having
this
on
tap
a
year
ago
march
and
i
thought
it
was
much
hoppier
and
smooth
just
an
average
offering
and
the
weird
flavors
make
this
substandard
imo
not
bad
but
not
particularly
interesting
either
this
is
a
great
beer
for
winter
not
too
hoppy
like
the
widmer
but
not
quite
as
dark
as
i
like
for
christmas
even
still
a
great
winter
beer
d
pretty
high
at
6
6
this
isnt
exactly
a
session
beer
but
its
a
refreshing
alternative
to
the
malt
bombs
everyone
seems
to
put
out
this
time
of
year
the
carbonation
is
the
only
sore
spot
for
me
its
high
enough
to
be
a
bit
unpleasant
in
my
book
i
like
two
below
one
of
the
lighter
drinking
more
hoppy
winter
efforts
youll
find
overall
this
is
the
best
new
belgian
bier
i
have
had
to
date
this
was
very
enjoyable
and
one
i
recommend
strongly
prosit
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
offwhite
head
aroma
is
bitter
hops
and
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
earthy
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malts
that
maintains
its
balance
all
the
way
to
the
finish
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
its
6
6
well
hidden
this
one
is
an
enjoyable
beer
for
a
cold
night
overall
this
beer
is
the
perfect
winter
seasonal
a
little
bite
with
some
equal
sweetness
definitely
conjures
up
some
feelings
of
warmth
and
happiness
drinkability
the
price
is
right
on
this
beer
and
it
is
very
sessionable
i
think
even
alot
of
nonbeer
folk
could
enjoy
this
one
d
nice
easy
flavor
that
was
quite
different
than
i
was
expecting
d
no
bitterness
mild
sweetness
good
mouthfeel
pleasent
aroma
and
flavors
all
add
up
to
an
easy
drinking
beer
d
this
brew
continues
to
be
a
winter
warmer
favorite
of
mine
exceptional
balance
and
flavor
make
this
a
nobrainer

other
comments
this
is
kind
of
a
sleeper
hit
of
a
beer
looking
at
it
you
dont
expect
much
but
then
youre
treated
to
a
nice
flavor
complexity
and
a
really
palatable
beer
i
drink
a
lot
of
fat
tire
and
enjoy
the
new
belgium
products
will
try
it
again
when
the
snow
flies
to
see
if
my
opinion
changes
drinkability
one
of
those
odd
ales
that
falls
between
the
cracks
its
not
a
great
representation
of
an
esb
and
doesnt
perform
too
well
as
a
winter
warmer
though
as
just
a
pleasant
easydrinking
beer
its
alright
very
tasty
beer
that
i
will
be
getting
more
of
thanks

this
is
not

and
overall
it
tastes
pretty
good
d
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
that
is
hopped
up
i

this
is
one
of
nbs
stronger
offerings
as
it
provides
that
hop
craving
one
may
have
during
the
winter
months
the

isnt
the
best
as
it
is
a

sharp

hot
nice

though
i
will
probably
buy
it
again
but
it
definitely
wont
be
something
that
i
seek
out
t
hops
arent
as
in
your
face
in
the
flavor
more
of
a
tangy
maltiness
with
just
faint
traces
of
mildly
bitter
pine
hops
in
the
background
the
flavor
doesnt
overwhelm
or
fill
the
palate
it
seems
half
absent
you
kind
of
have
to
work
for
it
this
however
creates
an
easy

drinkable
sensation
anyway
cheers
2
left
in
my
6
pack
and
then
its
off
to

not
the
best
but
decent
imo
drinkable
not
to
shabs
mouthfeel
had
a
distinctive
pucker
to
it
medium
bodied
some
malt
stickiness
and
definite
alcohol
warming
in
the
mix
it
made
for
a
drinkable
beer
but
a
mysterious
experience
overall
id
have
it
again
but
it
makes
me
yearn
for
more
hops
serving
temp
38
1
degrees
di
could
polish
of
a
sixer
with
no
problem
overall
its
a
really
nicely
done
malty
beer
that
never
gets
sweet
and
isnt
too
bitter
additionally
its
really
pretty
unique
in
that
it
kind
of
suggests
spices
where
there
are
none
quite
nice
d
a
very
average
beer
wouldnt
buy
again
drinkabilitythe
nose
gives
an
english
pale
ale
type
aroma
as
the
glass
comes
to
you
but
then
a
weird
mixture
of
beer
ingredients
hits
the
taste
buds
in
well
a
different
way
it
tastes
like
somebody
threw
a
mystery
recipe
together
and
this
is
what
came
out
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
amazing
offwhite
almost
tan
head
the
head
poured
about
two
fingers
and
was
almost
perfectly
level
this
smooth
and
frothy
beer
has
a
red
amber
body
it
has
a
piney
and
inviting
aroma
there
are
also
some
spice
and
bean
esters
there
is
definitely
clove
and
malt
tones
the
taste
is
also
piney
clove
like
and
herbal
there
is
sort
of
a
vegetable
aftertaste
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
bite
which
is
weird
because
you
do
not
see
the
bubbles
hazy
scarlet
red
thin
off
white
head
lacing
is
thin
grassy
hop
nose
with
a
toffee
like
malt
aroma
too
snappy
hop
presence
gives
this
esb
some
character
english
malt
backbone
is
sufficient
lending
toffee
notes
to
the
flavor
profile
dry
and
grassy
finish
easy
drinking
esb
nice
stuff
overall
i
like
this
one
i
think
i
would
pick
up
some
for
my
friends
at
9
bucks
a
six
pack
its
a
bit
pricey
but
it
is
a
nice
ale
pours
a
really
great
looking
reddish
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
on
it
has
a
wonderful
mixture
of
hops
and
biscuity
maltiness
to
it
really
looks
and
smells
great
taste
is
just
as
impressive
the
hops
and
malt
conteract
eachother
wonderfully
has
a
rich
full
flavor
to
it
just
awesome
all
around
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
great
too
my
favorite
offering
from
new
belgium
and
something
to
which
ill
return
each
winter
to
come
i
love
new
belgium
brewery
and
this
is
a
fine
release
from
them
once
again
d
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
however
im
not
sure
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
esb
this
beer
was
served
a
light
clear
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
of
white
rocky
head
thick
sticky
lacing
was
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
nose
is
of
yeast
and
breadiness
with
some
citrusy
hops
taste
starts
with
the
hops
spiciness
and
kick
and
then
leads
in
to
tastes
of
bread
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
i
expected
a
bit
heavier
feel
to
it
it
was
almost
watery
but
not
quite
watery
overall
a
decent
beer
that
went
down
smoothly
and
could
sit
with
for
an
evening
stylistically
i
think
this
beer
misses
however
i
do
find
this
a
very
interesting
try
this
comes
poured
in
a
pint
glass
at
the
airport
brewpub
in
denver
as
a
clear
bright
light
amber
with
a
fair
fuzzy
offwhite
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
toasted
floral
hops
with
some
rye
bread
thrown
in
the
flavor
brings
out
more
of
the
hops
almost
more
of
an
orange
citrus
with
a
floral
finish
sweet
and
nice
there
is
a
goodly
peppery
accent
throughout
very
refreshing
with
a
decent
creamy
feel
that
brings
a
subtle
touch
of
clove
nutmeg
but
is
entirely
drinkable
this
could
fit
in
with
some
folks
idea
of
an
ipa
and
i
did
like
it
very
much
recommended
thank
you
new
belgium
this
brew
pours
a
clean
golden
amber
with
about
about
a
finger
of
head
in
my
pilz
glass
and
is
inviting
nose
is
malty
with
some
must
hop
backing
on
my
tongue
the
malts
flavors
come
out
first
followed
by
the
musty
earthy
hopyness
that
im
not
altogether
sure
about
in
the
mouth
the
body
is
medium
but
finishes
with
a
bit
of
a
zingy
after
taste
all
in
all
this
beer
is
just
ok
to
good
for
me
pretty
much
the
same
as
all
the
other
new
belgium
beers
not
counting
erics
or
la
folie
all
in
all
a
solid
if
not
spectacular
offering
from
new
belgium
a
winter
ale
i
dont
see
how
more
like
a
hoppy
belgian
blonde
imho
pours
a
straight
up
orange
peeko
tea
copper
hardly
any
bubbling
film
of
foam
head
slightly
funky
hop
and
toasty
dry
bisuit
malt
aroma
well
hopped
but
somewhat
dry
on
the
palate
a
little
off
putting
plus
the
hopping
delves
into
the
skunky
bitter
of
hops
that
i
dont
really
care
for
the
finish
is
smooth
but
dont
let
this
beer
get
to
warm
unless
you
like
funky
hops
it
is
now
my
favorite
new
belgium
the
taste
is
bitter
citrusy
a
bit
on
the
hop
the
taste
then
is
of
malt
definite
alcohol
taste
making
this
i
suppose
a
bit
of
a
winter
warmer
the
taste
finishes
with
a
bitter
cleansing
hoppiness
overall
this
tastes
very
fresh
and
great
i
think
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
enjoy
it
while
it
lasts
another
quality
product
from
new
belgium
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
i
would
suggest
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
worth
the
timedollars
different
from
the
mountains
of
colorado
d
drinkable
was
given
a
sixpack
as
a
gift
though
i
will
not
be
buying
this
on
my
own
another
beer
i
would
not
have
sought
out
but
was
on
sale
so
i
grabbed
it
an
example
of
a
beer
that
may
advertise
as
esb
but
isnt
overwhelming
like
some
similar
in
that
regard
to
new
glarus
american
pale
ale
organic
revolution
grassy
and
citrus
hop
flavor
comes
out
on
top
in
the
taste
but
very
nice
sweet
malt
presence
balances
things
out
quite
well
gets
lost
in
the
shuffle
of
winter
warmers
but
really
is
a
great
brew
easily
my
favorite
new
belgian
beer
that
they
put
in
12
oz
bottles
taste
is
very
fresh
and
crisp
with
a
mellow
creamy
carbonation
feel
to
it
definitely
an
everyyear
purchase
for
me
served
chilled
straight
from
fridge
pours
a
good
big
head
foamy
good
lacing
malty
brownish
reddish
color
very
hoppy
aroma
some
malty
aroma
somewhat
spicy
malty
taste
good
taste
but
not
much
unlike
other
malty
beers
like
fat
tire
just
a
little
spicier
pours
a
dark
orangeamber
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
a
nice
collar
slight
laciness
and
moderate
clarity
aroma
is
very
piney
mixed
with
a
slight
maltiness
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
slight
bitterness
their
is
a
rough
unfinished
taste
that
adds
an
interesting
flavor
to
the
beer
good
body
with
a
good
not
heavy
texture
i
enjoyed
this
beer
an
excellent
and
interesting
flavor
light
body
and
texture
that
make
it
a
good
session
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
quite
quaffable
the
well
balanced
flavor
and
thinner
mouthfeel
gives
this
a
better
than
average
drinkability
usually
i
like
a
dry
finish
but
it
didnt
seem
to
fit
with
the
overall
concept
this
beer
was
going
for
d
well
last
time
i
had
this
i
had
3
and
i
really
liked
it
i
enjoyed
the
hoppiness
but
this
batch
i
dont
like
as
much
possibly
just
a
slight
variation
or
age
im
not
sure
or
maybe
it
was
what
i
was
eating
at
the
time
i
gave
it
another
shot
actually
this
is
its
other
shot
while
warmer
and
well
the
sweet
corn
taste
finally
gives
way
to
some
bitterness
but
i
can
still
pick
up
a
faint
whiff
of
the
aroma
and
i
know
its
there
in
the
taste
and
its
distracting
to
me
definitely
dont
drink
this
below
cellar
temp
but
if
you
do
i
would
drink
it
close
to
freezing
as
it
suggests
on
the
label
shoulda
known
a
friend
turned
me
on
to
this
beer
and
i
was
happy
he
did
this
beer
pour
very
clear
with
a
light
amber
color
it
has
a
very
bold
but
clean
hop
aroma
and
flavor
malts
are
also
in
ballance
although
a
winter
ale
i
could
see
this
beer
being
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
take
on
a
strong
bitter
here
with
more
of
an
assertive
hoppiness
than
i
would
have
thought
and
i
actually
didnt
mind
the
beefier
feel
as
it
added
some
warmth
to
the
glass
and
made
for
some
good
winter
drinking
solid
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
6
50
a
six
in
oregon
nice
orangered
color
with
a
foamy
thick
white
head
smells
alright
hmm
tastes
liek
a
little
hops
then
some
maltiness
good
and
seems
hoppy
for
an
esb
which
is
just
fine
with
me
overall
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
beer
to
drink
while
shooting
a
game
of
pool
which
is
exactly
what
i
did
drinkability
in
one
sense
good
light
on
the
mouth
but
after
a
while
the
taste
is
just
too
weak
palate
offers
a
nice
balance
with
malt
and
hops
again
the
cherry
citrus
flavors
come
through
nicely
rounded
and
it
ends
on
a
slightly
sweet
finish
exceptionally
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
very
approachable
too
for
those
not
fully
invested
in
craft
ales
d
not
all
that
bad
it
seems
that
new
belgium
specializes
solely
in
toasted
attributes
in
their
beers
or
at
least
what
i
have
sampled
from
the
collection
they
offer
i
find
that
the
seasonal
release
of
2
below
is
somewhat
strange
for
a
winter
warmer
style
type
beer
but
with
all
that
aside
this
beer
is
tasty
ok
but
not
great
well
i
tried
it
warmer
but
i
didnt
like
it
that
way
either
this
just
isnt
my
favorite
beer
sorry
if
you
really
love
it
but
its
just
not
my
thing
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
dthis
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
a
wellbalanced
brew
good
flavors
and
a
great
feel
flavors
are
appropriate
and
smooth
though
perhaps
not
very
complex
pours
a
clear
red
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
and
lacing
looking
good
i
like
this
beer
the
aroma
and
malt
background
have
a
chocolate
biscuit
character
while
juicy
citrus
hops
run
throughout
the
beer
it
finishes
with
a
mild
rind
bitterness
the
hops
are
pretty
big
for
an
esb
or
whatever
this
is
but
theyre
wonderfully
balanced
this
is
a
fine
winter
ale
d
though
i
could
probably
put
down
a
few
of
these
its
a
bit
underwhelming
and
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
cheers
and
hoppy
holidays
my
overall
impressions
are
mixed
good
almost
overwhelming
hop
bitterness
but
the
malt
profile
was
lacking
in
stature
definitely
a
winter
warmer
type
of
esb
recommended
if
you
like
boozy
bitterness
d
this
beer
didnt
do
much
for
me
certainly
good
as
a
session
beer
but
nothing
about
it
stood
out
to
me
very
middle
of
the
road
jk
conclusion
definitely
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
nb
its
definitely
a
different
take
on
a
winter
beer
and
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
to
me
it
seems
unfortunately
that
lots
of
nb
beers
taste
pretty
similar
this
is
a
richerhoppier
version
of
a
fat
tire
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
a
spicy
alcohol
warming
the
finish
is
bitter
but
pleasant
it
leaves
a
nice
lasting
wonderful
note
on
the
palate
i
dont
really
like
esbs
but
this
is
one
i
particularly
enjoyed
it
is
nice
for
a
cold
winter
day
d
highly
drinkable
flavorful
but
not
as
heavy
as
other
winter
beers
this
combined
with
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
good
one
to
have
a
couple
of
or
to
share
pitchers
with
friends
not
a
bad
brew
not
really
impressed
though
just
an
average
esb
with
an
american
twist
not
sure
if
i
enjoyed
it
that
much
d
a
solid
beer
nothing
too
special
about
it
but
its
a
pleasurable
drink
d
very
nicely
done
mnalt
and
hop
balance
makes
for
a
fine
beer
abv
is
limiting
another
thank
you
to
flexabull
for
the
chance
to
try
this
via
secret
santa
this
is
a
fine
beer
pours
a
very
thin
head
and
a
bright
orange
color
the
hops
power
through
the
taste
and
hints
of
spices
come
through
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
and
though
it
doesnt
have
as
thick
a
mouthfeel
as
many
winter
ales
it
is
certainly
still
full
of
bright
citrusy
and
spicy
flavor
d
im
moving
on
a
very
drinkable
quenchable
brew
to
have
a
few
of
while
in
need
of
something
favorably
sessionable
for
winter
or
really
whenever
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
nonic
kind
of
an
apple
juicegolden
amber
color
eggshell
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
earthy
and
somewhat
vegetal
malt
aroma
with
an
herbal
spicy
hop
profile
toasty
bready
malt
flavor
with
a
very
english
hoppiness
caramel
sweetness
and
nice
subtle
balance
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
really
extremely
easy
to
drink
not
bad
and
not
off
the
mark
stylistically
but
i
have
to
ask
why
the
hell
would
you
make
your
winter
beer
an
esb
its
not
hearty
fullbodied
or
especially
strong
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
rocky
white
head
the
nose
is
floral
citrus
notes
of
milk
chocolate
and
toasted
white
bread
comes
across
the
palate
with
a
dominant
toasted
malt
bread
biscuit
and
wild
flower
flavor
this
has
a
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
and
continues
throughout
still
havent
had
anything
bad
from
new
belgium
great
winter
seasonal
d
this
is
probably
one
of
new
belgiums
best
beers
while
it
probably
wouldnt
be
great
for
a
session
beer
at
6
6
abv
it
tastes
good
enough
youll
never
want
to
use
it
as
one
anyway
someone
below
commented
that
this
beer
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
because
it
doesnt
fit
neatly
into
one
particular
style
i
hope
that
was
a
joke
thank
gd
some
breweries
out
there
are
still
pushing
the
envelope
and
breaking
the
rules
overall
this
beer
is
decent
but
nothing
that
i
plan
on
reaching
for
again
if
i
had
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
i
would
be
thrusting
them
into
the
hands
of
friends
overall
a
drinkable
bitter
but
not
a
resounding
winner
for
a
seasonal
offering
pours
orange
with
a
thin
head
faint
nose
with
slight
hints
of
hops
that
get
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
tastes
more
like
a
winter
warmer
to
me
than
anything
else
but
with
twinges
of
a
pale
ale
at
times
finishes
malty
at
first
and
then
the
hops
kick
in
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
over
6
md
very
drinkable
light
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
hoppness
at
the
finish
highly
recommended
over
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
probably
a
one
and
done
for
me
however
d
fairly
drinkable
i
think
some
people
wouldnt
have
more
than
23
in
a
sitting
but
you
could
definitely
have
more
i
had
this
as
part
of
the
old
chicago
winter
beer
tour
i
have
been
eyeing
this
for
a
while
and
was
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
i
found
it
to
be
quite
a
drinkable
brew
although
i
am
not
a
fan
of
hops
this
was
nicely
balanced
with
just
enough
hops
to
cut
through
the
sausage
pasta
i
was
eating
very
good
pours
light
orange
just
as
the
bottle
says
grass
pepper
and
hops
in
the
nose
smooth
flavor
though
the
flavors
seem
to
compete
good
malt
character
you
expect
from
an
esb
but
a
lot
of
hops
that
you
expect
from
a
west
coast
ipa
its
like
the
beer
doesnt
know
what
it
shoud
be
when
cool
its
a
malty
ipa
as
it
warms
the
esb
qualities
emerge
doesnt
really
matter
its
still
a
pretty
good
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
fluffy
white
head
retention
and
lacing
were
minimal
smell
is
nice
at
first
sniff
i
detect
a
good
amount
of
hops
with
a
bit
of
a
biscuity
malt
backbone
the
hops
did
smell
nice
and
fresh
i
thought
the
taste
was
good
but
something
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
there
were
some
hops
at
first
but
it
finished
with
a
caramel
malt
taste
which
is
weird
it
seems
like
most
beers
you
get
the
malt
first
and
then
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
light
a
little
too
thin
i
thought
overall
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
my
favorite
beer
from
new
belgium
thus
far
still
all
of
their
beers
are
overyeasted
imho
theres
better
winter
beers
out
there
but
a
solid
offering
from
the
new
belgium
staff
give
it
a
try
the
base
is
in
place
for
a
solid
rotund
esbtype
ale
but
i
question
the
hop
varieties
that
are
used
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
surprisingly
bright
rich
gold
color
the
head
was
white
retained
well
as
a
collar
and
left
solid
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
was
nice
blend
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
plus
caramel
malt
the
flavors
were
also
mostly
hoppy
but
it
started
with
a
flash
of
biscuitlike
malt
and
some
hints
of
caramel
followed
by
the
crisp
citrus
hop
presence
some
brown
sugar
showed
up
as
it
warmed
but
it
generally
remained
rather
acidic
an
odd
combination
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
the
same
an
interesting
beer
but
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
go
looking
for
winter
brews
and
it
never
really
came
together
for
me
a
good
offering
from
new
belgium
good
drinkability
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
at
first
i
really
was
impressed
with
it
it
had
a
great
taste
to
it
one
that
would
go
good
with
a
nice
thanksgiving
meal
but
after
having
the
1554
it
just
felt
weak
i
felt
cheated
with
the
2
below
it
seemed
like
the
half
way
point
of
a
great
beer
loved
it
dont
get
me
wrong
new
belgium
still
is
doing
good
but
i
just
felt
like
i
was
hanging
there
should
remain
a
seasonal
d
drinks
great
for
me
but
hops
might
be
a
bit
much
for
some
folks
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
new
belgium
its
the
first
one
ive
had
from
them
where
the
hops
take
on
a
prominent
role
very
good
aroma
and
quite
tasty
d
an
esb
is
a
pretty
unique
choice
for
a
winter
seasonal
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
this
one
i
could
have
a
couple
of
in
a
sitting
and
id
like
to
have
it
a
few
times
before
its
gone
for
the
year
this
stuff
was
pretty
decent
kind
of
like
fat
tire
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
for
some
but
its
not
really
to
my
tastes
for
me
a
difficult
beer
to
put
into
words
but
i
enjoyed
it
ive
noticed
a
few
times
that
people
think
its
really
similar
to
fat
tire
to
my
tastes
its
a
pretty
big
departure
with
much
more
hops
a
good
thing
in
my
book
a
dark
pumpkin
ring
of
foam
along
the
edges
3
50
s
bready
and
grainy
the
aroma
definitely
favors
the
malt
though
there
is
a
noticeable
hop
bite
3
50
t
the
palate
is
quite
a
bit
more
bitter
than
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
strong
bitterness
some
dark
cherries
and
slightly
medicinal
3
25
m
light
to
medium
bodied
3
50
d
a
very
nonconfrontational
beer
decent
but
nothing
to
rant
and
rave
about
3
50
dnotes
to
be
honest
i
actually
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
thinking
it
would
be
different
than
fat
tire
as
i
am
really
not
a
big
of
it
before
i
even
had
a
chance
to
try
it
i
was
hearing
it
was
similar
to
fat
tire
and
i
almost
fell
into
the
trap
of
judging
it
before
i
tried
it
for
myself
come
to
find
out
it
is
somewhat
like
fat
tire
but
unlike
the
flagship
brew
this
winter
release
has
ample
hops
to
balance
out
the
excessive
biscuit
like
malt
flavor
i
dont
care
for
in
fat
tire
this
is
overall
a
very
good
winter
beer
perfectly
balanced
and
has
enough
abv
to
be
warming
but
two
or
three
of
these
for
most
beer
lovers
shouldnt
be
too
much
either
cant
wait
to
visit
colorado
for
the
first
time
this
december
as
i
plan
to
try
this
on
tap
close
to
where
it
brewed
pours
a
clear
copper
orange
color
with
a
huge
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
recedes
slowly
becoming
rocky
and
leaving
some
nice
sheets
of
lacing
well
rounded
aroma
of
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
certainly
balanced
in
the
nose
taste
is
quite
sweet
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toasty
malts
and
the
hopping
seems
to
be
a
bit
light
with
casual
flavors
of
citrus
and
light
pine
fairly
well
balanced
but
could
have
used
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
light
carbonation
a
nice
winter
ale
but
doesnt
taste
much
like
an
esb
too
much
caramel
malt
and
too
little
hop
bitterness
to
be
considered
such
but
still
tasty
overall
this
wasnt
a
particularly
memorable
brew
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
and
when
its
gone
that
will
be
all
id
really
care
to
have
of
this
not
a
beer
which
beckoned
me
back
for
more
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
between
caramel
malt
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
leans
a
little
more
toward
the
malty
side
but
there
is
still
a
nice
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
nicer
new
belgium
beers
i
have
tasted
i
could
happily
drink
this
beer
again
d
if
youre
craving
a
dumbeddown
fat
tire
this
beers
for
you
i
really
like
this
bitter
a
smooth
lightly
malty
and
sharp
hop
bite
at
the
end
that
is
really
delicious
a
great
sipper
that
i
wish
was
more
available
around
here
a
definite
huge
winner
from
new
belgium
crisp
hop
presence
gives
a
really
nice
lingering
character
with
a
lovely
view
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
terminal
with
the
white
peaks
that
emulates
said
mountains
i
ordered
a
2
degrees
below
this
beer
appeared
a
medium
copper
with
a
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
was
of
muted
floral
hops
the
taste
showed
caramel
malt
and
more
floral
hops
the
beer
had
a
mild
carbonation
with
a
medium
weight
body
this
reminded
me
of
brewsters
beer
style
only
a
little
bit
hoppier
it
was
a
nice
quaff
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
while
waiting
for
a
connection
flight
or
otherwise
d
this
ale
is
no
doubt
very
similar
to
fat
tire
but
i
have
to
say
i
liked
this
one
more
the
toasted
nut
flavor
is
found
in
both
but
this
ale
had
a
delicious
little
hop
bite
that
was
just
right
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
my
fav
nb
brew
is
still
the
1554
the
new
abby
pours
a
crisp
copper
color
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
it
smells
almost
like
a
crisp
winter
morning
with
a
fresh
layer
of
snow
reminds
me
of
outdoor
hockey
games
tastes
like
a
wonderful
simple
bitter
with
a
well
balanced
flavor
im
not
really
sure
why
its
a
winter
beer
but
its
good
d
not
terribly
complex
a
good
winter
seasonal
im
not
a
huge
new
belgium
fan
but
this
one
definitely
shines
a
solid
winter
brew
i
think
the
malt
character
shop
hopping
and
spiciness
make
it
a
perfect
winter
brew
definitely
fits
the
bill
and
worth
warming
up
to
this
winter
a
nice
esb
and
a
bit
different
but
just
a
bit
thin
and
the
abv
is
too
high
for
sessionability
i
would
drink
this
again
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
new
belgium
current
seasonals
beautiful
hop
smell
and
taste
not
over
the
top
but
a
strong
malt
balance
good
color
only
problem
was
the
tap
was
over
carbonated
and
the
resulting
pour
was
poor
not
the
beers
fault
but
the
pub
im
not
sure
why
this
doesnt
score
better
on
ba
but
i
think
its
an
idea
winter
warmer
it
looks
good
with
an
attractive
amberorange
color
whispy
lacing
on
the
glass
as
its
consumed
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
clean
with
some
citrus
and
toffee
the
taste
is
a
hybrid
of
american
and
english
charactersits
it
starts
clean
with
some
bready
malts
caramel
come
in
then
diacetyl
the
hop
flowers
provide
clean
hop
bitterness
the
tailend
of
the
journey
leaves
a
buttery
feel
and
taste
in
the
mouth
dont
worry
theres
none
of
that
buttered
popcorn
taste
right
on
target
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
must
try
cheers
to
new
belgium
for
how
cheap
this
is
i
enjoy
picking
this
up
in
the
winter
an
easy
drinking
beer
poured
with
a
good
finger
width
head
reducing
down
to
a
light
lacing
of
foam
good
deep
amber
great
smelling
hops
beer
and
barley
odor
the
beer
tastes
of
fresh
hops
with
hints
of
rye
this
is
a
great
seasonal
beer
that
new
belguim
pumps
out
each
and
every
year
that
i
cannot
wait
till
it
comes
out
sixer
from
the
vacaville
nugget
pours
a
glimmering
amberbrown
not
really
much
of
a
head
a
little
white
lace
on
top
mildly
toasted
barley
odor
hint
of
rye
green
hops
taste
is
also
very
bisctuiy
like
a
digestive
biscuit
for
those
of
you
who
grew
up
in
england
hint
of
grassy
hop
finish
is
reminiscent
of
eating
some
dry
whole
wheat
toast
medium
bodied
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
want
to
say
its
interesting
but
only
marginally
i
dont
know
if
id
but
this
again
but
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
sixer
id
rather
drink
it
on
a
summer
evening
on
the
porch
its
more
of
an
ipa
then
anything
else
d
the
first
half
of
the
beer
tasted
pretty
good
then
from
there
on
it
went
downhill
wont
get
this
again
worth
trying
just
dont
expect
this
to
be
a
big
winter
beer
a
friend
brought
me
some
new
belgium
brewerys
2
below
which
was
really
quite
tasty
it
was
my
first
beer
of
the
night
and
i
dug
it
a
lot
since
this
is
an
esb
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
more
aggressive
than
your
average
beer
in
terms
of
hops
and
alcohol
content
but
nothing
overpowering
it
is
really
not
bitter
at
all
but
balanced
between
hops
and
malts
i
drank
it
right
out
of
the
bottle
like
a
classy
broad
so
i
didnt
really
look
at
color
or
head
but
it
is
a
basic
copper
colored
ale
and
it
was
quite
quite
tasty
a
coppersih
body
with
a
tan
head
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
basic
with
light
hops
and
faint
smalts
no
big
flavors
here
either
slight
hoppy
bitterness
pretty
light
body
a
good
session
beer
i
suppose
but
nothing
special
how
can
they
sell
this
for
the
same
price
as
1554
seeing
that
it
is
classed
as
an
esb
here
makes
sense
to
me
its
got
a
robust
body
with
plenty
of
flavour
and
both
malt
and
hops
sweet
and
bitter
with
great
balance
d
it
isnt
an
offensive
beer
and
by
no
means
is
it
undrinkable
but
this
beer
falls
a
little
short
for
me
this
is
my
least
favorite
new
belgium
beer
by
far
the
drinkability
is
good
i
would
try
this
again
prosit
mk
i
dont
get
the
typical
winter
warmer
feel
from
this
beer
but
it
is
an
esb
typical
german
hops
add
a
spice
that
isnt
usually
in
an
esb
but
it
is
still
a
good
balance
and
has
a
good
body
slight
warming
as
i
drink
but
6
6
seems
to
hide
well
pours
a
five
finger
rocky
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
hoppy
nose
flavor
is
not
as
hoppy
as
brewer
says
not
the
usual
esb
hints
of
sweetness
very
drinkable
1
49
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
johns
marketplace
portland
or
smells
of
malts
and
very
light
herbaceous
smell
taste
is
sweet
but
hoppy
nice
smooth
finish
but
nothing
worth
waking
the
kids
or
calling
the
neighbors
over
is
a
very
easy
drinker
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
major
d
it
started
out
strong
leaving
a
great
first
impression
however
it
was
down
hill
from
there
it
lacked
a
bitter
profile
but
was
creamy
and
smooth
it
was
interesting
but
not
worth
a
long
session
the
aroma
didnt
do
much
for
me
as
i
only
seemed
to
get
a
strong
maltiness
to
it
the
flavor
was
malt
dominated
crisp
on
the
finish
and
gave
a
slight
hop
taste
that
lingered
as
the
brew
went
down
it
was
nicely
carbonated
and
overall
a
nice
average
winter
warmer
overall
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
given
the
ease
of
the
drink
and
moderate
alc
at
6
6
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
if
this
was
available
to
me
365
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
keep
it
stocked
in
my
collection
mouthfeelit
is
surprising
with
a
hoppy
nose
it
immediately
gives
way
to
a
healthy
malty
body
that
tastes
richer
and
darker
than
it
looks
a
froth
on
the
palate
livens
up
the
hops
and
leaves
a
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
tasty
and
quaffable
solid
transluscent
amber
pour
with
a
medium
sudsy
white
head
smell
is
metallic
and
subtle
toasty
toffee
like
malt
with
a
nice
bright
hop
presence
as
well
body
is
surprisingly
fuller
than
expected
and
perfectly
carbonated
nice
toffee
maltiness
faint
tartness
then
a
very
light
lingering
bittersweetness
in
the
finish
a
pretty
nice
esb
and
better
and
hoppier
than
expected
notes
this
beer
seems
very
similar
to
fat
tire
that
same
biscuit
flavor
is
very
apparent
tasted
like
a
heartier
version
of
the
new
belguim
classic
drinkability
this
was
like
velvet
liquid
it
was
stiff
enough
to
earn
the
esb
moniker
yet
easy
enough
to
go
down
freely
its
probably
one
of
the
bestdrinking
esbs
that
ive
ever
had
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
white
2finger
head
that
left
a
nice
amount
of
laceing
all
the
way
down
the
smell
was
very
malty
and
the
taste
was
slightly
hoppy
and
bitter
the
overall
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
light
not
really
much
carbonation
detected
either
overall
this
beer
was
decent
i
expected
more
from
new
belgium
fairly
drinkable
its
not
my
favorite
style
on
the
planet
but
i
do
enjoy
an
esb
from
time
to
time
this
one
fits
the
style
pretty
well
minus
just
a
bit
more
bitterness
that
would
help
it
i
think
maybe
some
golding
hops
would
help
it
i
purchased
a
six
pack
for
my
super
bowl
viewing
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
and
dark
looks
nice
the
nose
is
malty
with
nice
hoppy
background
notes
and
some
faint
cinnamon
nutmeg
or
something
it
is
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
is
a
bit
strange
out
of
balance
in
my
opinion
first
hit
with
strong
malt
and
then
over
the
top
hoppiness
and
a
strong
alcohol
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
initial
creamy
then
very
carbonated
i
only
drank
4
of
the
six
pack
and
it
was
enough
this
beer
is
probably
better
on
tap
but
in
over
the
top
and
out
of
balance
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
for
most
winter
brews
out
there
the
malt
flavor
is
awesome
its
clean
but
has
plenty
of
flavor
good
balance
of
toastiness
and
sweetness
just
enough
hops
for
me
perhaps
a
little
low
for
the
style
but
i
think
thats
what
the
beer
is
going
for
excepting
rabid
hopheads
an
interesting
brew
that
should
satisify
most
hop
cravings
fine
for
mine
drinkability
new
belgium
has
put
forth
a
very
enjoyable
esb
sitting
here
in
my
cosy
condo
while
its
snowing
outside
enjoying
a
2
below
couldnt
get
any
better
cheers
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
sharp
prickly
carbonation
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
but
it
doesnt
really
end
up
wowing
me
id
have
little
trouble
drinking
another
but
have
no
desire
to
do
so
pretty
average
bad
bottle
damaged
in
transit
who
knows
this
wasnt
good
ill
try
it
again
if
possible
cause
i
know
new
belgium
can
do
better
than
this
overall
a
nice
little
dry
hopped
winter
beer
not
my
favorite
but
i
pick
up
a
sixpack
every
year
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
had
a
little
bolder
aromas
and
flavors
overall
i
credit
them
for
trying
something
a
little
different
but
it
just
came
out
weird
to
me
wouldnt
buy
again
d
its
alright
but
not
one
ill
go
for
again
the
flaws
seem
to
outweigh
the
good
parts
of
this
beer
sadly
overall
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
a
clean
yelloworange
colored
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
creamy
white
head
and
lacing
that
looks
like
a
milk
mustache
the
aroma
has
a
strong
spicy
hop
character
and
an
light
biscuit
malt
note
with
a
hint
of
clove
in
the
background
the
start
of
the
taste
begins
with
a
light
biscuit
malt
note
on
the
front
of
your
tongue
followed
by
that
nice
spicy
hop
character
on
the
back
edges
of
your
tongue
and
mouth
that
leads
to
a
crisp
and
refreshing
finish
the
taste
is
similar
if
i
were
to
describe
it
in
3
words
or
less
id
say
fat
tire
light
a
nice
beer
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
hoppy
based
on
the
blurb
on
the
label
i
used
a
bit
of
this
to
baste
and
steam
the
inside
of
a
roasted
chicken
and
it
provided
a
perfect
complement
to
the
bird
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wont
necessarily
look
forward
to
each
year
great
option
to
match
with
poultry
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
clear
light
bronze
appearance
with
thin
white
head
smells
like
what
i
remember
fat
tire
tasting
like
very
distinguishable
yeast
flavor
tastes
much
the
same
a
bit
hoppier
perhaps
i
dont
care
much
for
the
flavor
definitely
too
similar
to
fat
tire
which
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
either
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
probably
pay
money
for
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
all
night
i
would
buy
it
again
not
really
a
session
beer
though
pretty
high
alcohol
content
for
an
e
s
b
all
in
all
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
fat
tire
or
new
belgium
brewing
after
all
the
craze
but
this
beer
changed
my
mind
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
tiny
offwhite
head
that
quickly
drops
into
some
patchy
lacing
aroma
is
toasty
caramel
and
earthy
hops
light
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
tase
has
lots
of
earthy
hops
bitterness
with
a
toasted
caramel
malt
presence
underneath
a
hint
of
pear
fails
to
fully
emerge
nicely
drinkable
but
pedestrian
i
served
this
beer
right
at
the
recommended
temp
of
38
degrees
i
think
for
this
medium
bodied
ale
a
warmer
temp
allows
more
flavor
to
come
out
after
the
initial
sip
i
let
mine
sit
for
15
minutes
allowing
the
spiced
flavor
to
become
more
complex
2
below
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
a
full
off
white
head
the
head
lingers
just
on
the
surface
as
the
beer
becomes
less
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
reminiscent
of
homemade
pumpkin
pie
on
thanksgiving
day
there
is
also
a
noticable
smell
of
pears
and
earthiness
that
i
just
cant
ignore
no
real
hop
presence
in
the
smell
but
the
spices
noted
cinnamon
allspice
and
cloves
are
pleasant
the
taste
is
good
with
a
sweetness
similar
to
spiced
rum
the
hops
create
a
bitterness
that
balances
but
there
is
not
a
noticable
hop
flavor
the
6
6
abv
bites
just
after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
thicker
than
you
would
think
for
such
a
clear
beer
it
floats
around
the
cheeks
and
dances
over
the
tongue
warming
the
throat
as
it
is
swallowed
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
a
chilly
desert
night
surrounded
by
good
friends
pours
pale
amber
with
little
head
aromas
of
apricot
with
a
bit
of
funk
and
a
little
christmas
spiciness
thought
this
is
quite
restrained
tastes
of
mandarin
oranges
apricots
and
a
bit
of
metal
slightly
sweet
but
not
overly
so
light
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
this
somewhat
refreshing
but
the
spice
and
sweetness
less
so
not
bad
but
ive
enjoyed
a
number
of
other
winter
ales
more
bright
copper
apricot
body
with
a
thick
finger
of
marshmallowy
light
beige
head
terrific
lacing
up
the
glass
vibrantly
green
hop
nose
mint
pine
needles
and
herbal
tea
doughy
biscuit
malt
background
with
light
fruits
nutty
malt
and
floral
hop
flavors
up
front
marmalade
and
honeydew
melon
follow
toffee
edges
herbal
minty
hop
bitterness
is
a
tad
underwhelming
in
the
finish
moderate
body
with
a
watery
flat
feel
a
little
off
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
biere
du
boucanier
snifter
poured
a
clear
copper
with
a
thick
white
head
classic
esb
apperance
however
the
smell
was
off
with
a
musty
malt
smell
mixed
with
a
slight
citrus
hp
aroma
taste
is
really
earthy
with
little
hop
flavor
but
with
a
slight
mushroom
and
chalky
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
i
cant
saw
for
me
this
beer
is
a
good
match
i
like
esb
and
funk
but
just
not
funky
esb
although
my
friend
loves
this
beer
to
each
his
own
it
pours
a
remarkably
clear
copper
color
the
head
is
pretty
nice
to
begin
with
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
but
it
doesnt
last
long
smell
is
of
bready
malts
molasses
faint
earthy
and
piney
hops
somewhat
unusual
somewhat
appetizing
if
sweet
i
find
this
to
be
a
pretty
well
balanced
beer
flavorwise
the
label
says
that
it
contains
a
bright
warming
blast
of
sterling
and
liberty
hops
along
with
tawnyroasted
malts
im
not
sure
if
its
the
wintery
packaging
but
i
taste
some
spices
in
here
while
other
reviewers
draw
comparisons
to
fat
tire
this
tastes
to
me
more
like
something
from
the
anchor
catalog
a
higher
abv
offering
from
new
belgium
that
is
both
sessionable
and
fairly
tasty
one
of
these
was
more
then
enough
and
i
dont
plan
to
ever
order
it
again
i
was
trying
to
choose
between
the
trippel
in
bottle
and
something
on
draft
at
the
airport
and
made
the
mistake
of
going
with
this
ho
hum
so
here
it
says
its
an
esb
but
you
can
see
form
the
nameimage
that
nb
is
marketing
this
as
some
kind
of
winter
warmer
well
i
guess
esb
is
probably
pretty
close
other
than
the
toopale
color
and
the
toobitter
mouth
this
might
make
a
decent
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
a
lawnmower
beer
but
its
way
not
enough
anything
for
a
day
below
50f
for
me
ah
right
other
than
bitter
but
id
definitely
say
that
the
bitterness
was
all
of
of
proportion
unless
again
this
is
for
the
sweaty
hot
days
of
summer
just
change
the
label
and
marketing
and
youll
be
all
set
d
what
a
nice
winter
brew
ive
always
felt
that
esbs
are
some
of
the
most
sessionable
if
not
the
most
complex
or
mindboggling
beers
and
this
one
is
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
with
the
added
bonus
of
come
really
nice
mellow
spices
i
had
this
at
my
parents
house
over
the
holidays
the
label
states
this
is
a
winter
warmer
and
ba
lists
it
as
an
esb
but
i
think
its
more
of
a
pale
ale
it
smells
nicely
hopped
sterling
and
liberty
apparently
but
the
malt
backbone
adds
some
sweetness
to
the
taste
as
well
easily
drinkable
as
an
apa
in
my
opinion
pours
crystal
clear
with
an
amber
color
with
a
ruby
touch
to
it
decent
sized
head
nose
is
extremely
heavy
on
the
hops
just
overpowering
almost
flavor
is
even
and
smooth
but
i
get
something
odd
on
there
i
just
cant
place
it
inexperience
but
its
almost
like
a
port
like
character
that
peeks
out
at
you
at
the
start
you
get
an
almost
thin
layer
of
pine
which
fades
to
what
i
think
is
an
alcohol
tone
after
some
time
feel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
think
would
be
appropriate
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
though
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
by
any
means
beautiful
beer
a
must
for
hop
heads
sneak
a
little
more
malt
in
the
taste
and
youve
got
an
a
i
dont
think
a
lot
of
breweries
make
a
winter
seasonal
out
of
an
esb
new
belgium
did
and
i
think
it
worked
great
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
would
recommend
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
smells
of
sweet
tarts
a
slight
hint
of
hops
and
flowery
notes
last
first
taste
is
not
as
tart
as
one
would
seem
but
the
bite
of
hops
is
there
this
beer
warms
the
belly
a
highly
drinkable
offering
from
new
belgium
that
changes
with
each
taste
as
the
beer
gets
warmer
and
is
exposed
to
more
air
the
more
it
develops
or
becomes
more
complex
3rd
taste
its
starting
to
settle
down
not
as
much
of
a
bite
this
years
version
is
better
than
last
year
much
better
this
time
of
year
in
fc
this
beer
is
a
great
choice
d
it
took
me
some
getting
use
to
before
really
liking
it
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
i
like
this
beer
could
drink
a
few
too
many
the
6
6
abv
could
creep
up
on
you
maybe
a
little
off
for
an
esb
but
i
dig
it
d
oh
yes
its
drinkable
in
fact
im
going
to
be
a
scrooge
and
not
share
hahahaha
im
not
sorry
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
ale
unfortunately
the
metallic
burnt
maltbread
taste
diminishes
my
enjoyment
of
this
so
id
want
a
change
of
taste
after
two
or
so
and
even
then
id
only
be
having
this
once
in
a
while
in
the
first
place
12
oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
solid
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
over
top
the
clarity
on
this
is
fantastic
and
there
are
large
bubbles
forming
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
and
cascading
up
to
the
top
the
aroma
is
very
earthy
with
a
strong
toasted
german
malt
character
along
with
some
biscuitlike
qualities
that
i
associate
with
other
beers
from
this
brewery
the
hop
only
comes
through
to
me
in
the
earthy
character
the
flavor
accentuates
the
toasted
and
biscuity
malt
character
there
is
a
mild
earthy
hop
in
there
that
comes
through
on
the
finish
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
a
little
herbal
character
as
well
from
the
hop
i
find
as
a
i
drink
this
the
malt
seems
to
diminish
and
the
hop
seems
a
bit
more
upfront
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
of
fine
bubbles
overall
this
one
is
not
bad
the
malt
character
is
and
never
will
be
my
favorite
but
i
think
it
is
what
the
brewer
wants
so
i
can
take
that
as
it
is
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
the
6
i
got
will
be
consumed
without
much
worry
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
brews
ive
had
only
because
it
tastes
like
christmas
it
really
does
have
a
feeling
of
having
a
spruce
or
pine
in
your
mouth
totally
weird
but
true
pours
a
nice
caramel
with
a
little
bubblely
head
and
fair
lace
head
dissipates
rapidly
smells
of
light
floral
hops
nothing
impressive
here
tastes
the
way
christmas
trees
smell
odd
but
interesting
nonetheless
pours
copper
brilliant
orange
flecks
of
vermilion
foamy
and
bubbly
blondewhite
head
medium
in
size
lacing
forms
two
wide
intricately
drippy
arcs
frosty
looking
aroma
is
warm
and
lightly
hoppy
with
a
spicy
sweet
touch
toast
suds
apples
caramel
sweet
grass
liquor
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
juicy
with
a
very
light
carbonation
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
subtle
bread
malt
woodiness
with
overtones
of
peach
citrus
flour
and
dust
earthy
for
sure
malts
and
hops
are
balanced
in
pretty
good
stride
here
a
touch
of
bitter
cinnamon
spice
comes
in
at
the
finish
aftertaste
is
light
and
a
touch
syrupy
with
a
gentle
bitterness
md
medium
body
carbonation
is
a
little
hight
but
not
bad
drinkability
is
a
little
low
due
to
taste
being
off
balance
but
the
beer
still
maintains
a
good
amount
of
drinkability
slowly
i
finish
my
second
one
of
the
night
and
decide
to
head
for
a
fat
tire
you
know
how
animals
grow
a
heavy
winter
coat
well
this
beer
is
fat
tire
before
the
spring
molt
our
cows
used
to
get
frisky
too
with
the
onset
of
winter
this
beer
is
a
bit
wild
drinkability
just
okay
easy
to
drink
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
slightly
hoppy
fat
tire
overall
not
the
best
among
new
belgiums
many
excellent
labels
skip
this
one
and
go
for
one
of
the
others
d
nice
to
drink
and
has
exceeded
my
expectations
i
had
set
them
low
this
time
around
not
really
knowing
too
much
about
the
beer
i
may
be
back
at
the
liquor
store
for
this
one
this
time
more
than
1
bottle
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
white
head
settling
fairly
quickly
some
lacing
aroma
is
less
fruity
than
i
remember
from
last
year
a
bit
heavier
on
the
malt
a
nice
malty
brew
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
everything
out
mouthfeel
is
fairly
mild
not
too
complex
drinkability
is
high
flavor
is
easy
on
the
palate
would
definetly
buy
this
againand
again
all
in
all
i
will
buy
it
again
passes
the
session
test
and
a
good
addition
to
my
upcoming
winter
options
d
this
is
a
very
good
esb
it
almost
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
it
is
some
hoppy
this
was
had
on
a
trip
to
colorado
very
near
fort
collins
exceptional
hop
malt
combination
with
caramel
and
coffee
balanced
wonderfully
with
the
alcohol
this
dubbel
has
eluded
me
in
my
area
ive
found
other
brews
from
new
belgium
brewery
buy
some
today
d
a
little
forward
to
drink
much
of
but
nice
if
you
want
something
different
someone
suggested
that
this
is
just
a
heavier
fat
tire
not
to
me
it
is
its
own
fine
self
and
a
good
warmer
to
keep
around
all
winter
taste
is
mild
and
grassy
with
a
brief
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
tasted
a
little
thin
to
me
for
something
advertised
as
a
winter
ale
more
of
a
boozy
fat
tire
to
enjoy
at
an
aftersunset
cookout
mild
flavor
and
low
carbonation
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
im
not
sure
if
this
is
accurately
categorized
as
an
extra
specialstrong
bitter
but
its
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
basically
this
is
a
heavier
version
of
fat
tire
very
nice
in
appearance
but
in
no
way
remarkable
smell
and
taste
are
biscuity
as
is
the
tire
but
with
a
little
more
spice
a
little
bit
of
fennel
and
some
grassiness
mouthfeel
is
round
but
hollow
this
isnt
bad
i
just
fail
to
see
how
it
qualifies
as
a
winter
warmer
a
lazy
illconceived
offering
from
an
otherwise
fine
brewery
smell
was
malt
and
a
little
yeast
tastes
is
malty
and
hoppy
a
little
fruit
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
seasonal
choice
i
like
to
have
some
of
this
in
my
fridge
for
the
holiday
season
drinks
pretty
easy
the
boozey
warmth
does
slow
you
down
a
bit
a
fair
esb
that
is
much
better
on
tap
imo
the
esb
offering
from
new
belgium
poured
a
radiant
clear
copper
a
fluffy
head
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
as
i
consume
smell
is
typical
malty
biscuit
that
nb
is
known
for
an
additional
amount
of
subdued
fruity
hops
taste
is
essentially
fat
tire
with
a
fair
amount
of
bittering
hops
the
fruitiness
apparent
in
the
nose
is
lost
on
me
here
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
fresh
and
i
found
the
brew
to
be
drinkable
tho
a
bit
boring
d
its
smooth
not
overly
hoppy
or
sweet
goes
down
pretty
easy
wouldnt
have
guessed
its
abv
6
60
not
too
filling
i
could
definitely
put
down
several
in
one
sitting
but
the
alcohol
does
creep
up
on
you
d
overall
drinkable
and
you
could
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
but
a
good
version
of
a
winter
warmer
maltiness
could
make
it
difficult
to
put
down
too
many
but
overall
drinkable
the
beer
pours
forth
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
a
shimmering
gold
with
a
prestigious
bright
white
creamy
head
after
its
evaporation
the
lace
forms
an
encircling
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
sweet
malt
dominates
the
nose
citrus
like
crispness
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
start
has
a
pleasing
malt
presents
somewhat
sweet
and
bit
of
bite
at
the
back
top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
has
an
authoritarian
acidity
the
hops
vigorous
in
their
acidity
dry
aftertaste
ends
it
all
and
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
look
for
more
in
a
winter
ale
smells
like
fat
tire
with
a
citrus
edge
taste
is
dominated
by
citrus
flavors
for
me
with
some
spices
and
hops
but
seems
to
lack
complexity
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
sort
of
unusual
not
bad
but
not
extremely
appealing
to
me
mouthfeel
is
adequate
theres
a
citrusy
aftertaste
for
me
that
is
reminiscent
of
watereddown
orange
juice
that
detracts
from
its
positives
maybe
its
just
because
im
coming
off
nbs
abbey
which
i
was
quite
impressed
with
but
im
not
quite
feeling
this
one
not
bad
or
anything
but
nothing
ill
seek
out
mouthfeel
has
a
crisp
medium
body
this
seems
to
be
lighter
fare
than
most
winter
seasonals
for
an
abv
of
6
6
you
cant
really
tell
i
think
i
could
drink
a
six
of
this
with
no
problems
no
wonder
everyone
wants
to
get
their
hands
on
it
i
am
glad
i
can
get
this
beer
locally
ill
be
stockin
up
on

i
was
expecting
a
nice
big
barlywine
to
take
the
chill
of
the
day
but
i
was
let
down
at
first
this
beer
grew
on
me
and
has
some
nice
fresh
hops
flavors
that
are
really
crisp
but
the
biscuit
malt
is
a
bit
too
much
thanks

into
a
kitchen
glass
nice
medium
amber
color
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
declared
esb
style
the
balance
is
leaning
heavier
on
the
nutty
malt
side
the
initial
finish
was
of
citrusy
hops
but
that
has
been
reduced
to
be
predominately
a
malty
beverage
as
i
continue
to
sample
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
and
complex
smell
includes
roasted
oats
and
wheat
i
find
it
to
be
slightly
sweet
and
simply
mouthwatering
starts
deliciously
sharp
but
very
smooth
settles
fullbodied
with
a
surgary
caramel
flavor
finish
is
strong
but
without
a
lasting
aftertaste
it
is
a
bold
mix
of
hop
bitters
that
leaves
you
wishing
for
the
next
sip

i
would
recommend
trying
this
at

once
beeragentdec

with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
behind
the
taste
was
led
by
hop
power
citrus
and
pine
with
nothing
dominating
or
overpowering
my
biggest
complaint
was
the
complete
lack
of
aftertaste
once
it
was
down
medium
body
with
a
fairly
malty
flavor
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
and
caramelly
but
in

no

this
beer
really
grew
on
me
first
sip
and
i
prepared
myself
for
some
boring
malt
bomb
with
no
depth
this
beer
actually
has
a
lot
going
on
i
can
confidently
say
this
is
my
favorite
new
belgium
beer
to
date
westsidethreatnov

which
in
most
breweries
was
a
stronger
version
of
their
basic
beers
very
nice

taste
is
the
same
grasseypineydandelion
green
taste
i
assume
there
is
malt
in
this
beer
since
it
is
a
winter
ale
but
i
cant
taste
it
because
of
the
dominance
of
the
oily
vegetable
drawer
hop
taste
no
balance
to
the
taste
at
all
although
it
gets
more
tolerable
towards
the
end
and
there
are
some
pleasant
spicy
notes
i
cant
say
i
am
happy
i
bought
6
of
these
maybe
if
your
a
serious
hop
head
youll
disagree
but
i
am
wishing
i
had
tried
another
brewers
winter
offering
it
looks
good
ill
give
it
that
leedorhamnov
18
but
not
very
enjoyable
i
think
they
used
a
little
too
much
biscuit
malts
if
they
toned
it
down
a
bit

was
a
fairly
clear
unbalanced
too
sweetymalty
leads
too
sweet
becomes
cloying
by
halfway
through
the
pint
wouldnt
order
again
the
style
overall
this
is
not
an
esb
this
is
an
ipa
without
aroma
hops
i
cannot
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
out
of
balance
overall
i
recommend
everyone
to
sample
this
others
may
really
like
it
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
wont
buy
too
often
due
to
competition
overall
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
anderson
valley
the
first
being
their
amber
ale
and
neither
are
even
a
decent
beer
let
alone
worth
the
topend
boutique
price
one
brewery
to
scratch
off
the
list
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
goblet
thin
head
but
nice
lacing
coppery
amber
color
and
hazy
aroma
is
citrus
and
malt
i
dont
quite
get
the
floral
notes
in
aroma
and
flavor
that
are
advertised
on
the
label
the
flavor
is
delightfully
bitter
grapefruit
with
pine
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
fair
amount
if
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
to
outstanding
bitter
ale
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
brewery
makes
several
styles
that
i
really
like
anderson
valley
still
remains
one
sneaky
brewery
they
are
producing
some
good
stuff
the
esb
while
not
my
favorite
style
is
quite
taste
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
12
finger
thick
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
is
slightly
sweet
with
bitter
hops
present
the
taste
is
bitter
at
the
front
then
smooths
with
a
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
glad
i
tried
it
golden
color
lots
of
white
lacing
but
could
be
due
to
that
fact
i
used
a
narrow
glass
disappeared
quickly
the
nose
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
floral
the
bottle
describes
it
as
lilacs
white
pepper
and
bartlett
pears
with
blueberry
honey
and
roses
not
sure
if
i
get
all
that
but
can
believe
the
floral
as
it
is
flavorful
but
dry
spicy
but
mild
in
my
opinioncrisp
finish
slightly
hops
fairly
standard
stuff
overall
tasty
but
nothing
really
intriguing
going
on
o
good
beer
i
like
the
black
pepper
notes
a
lot
thats
not
something
ive
really
tasted
in
beer
before
i
really
enjoy
the
spicy
tingle
in
the
mouthfeel
and
id
love
to
try
more
beers
with
similar
characteristics
prost
lampertland
o
a
delicious
and
authentic
esb
great
to
see
a
us
company
do
this
so
well
i
like
the
additional
citrus
hoppyness
makes
it
slightly
american
slightly
modern
would
go
well
with
british
pub
foods
amber
orange
color
with
a
two
finger
head
with
medium
retention
and
leaving
some
laces
delicious
citric
aroma
of
grapefruit
oranges
and
slightly
toasted
malts
nice
bitter
and
citric
taste
flavor
of
grapefruit
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
peppery
yeast
earthy
hops
and
burnt
italian
bread

abv
is
completely
hidden
this
belks
esb
version
gave
me
the
impression
to
be
better
than
the
previously
named
boont
esb
probably
due
to
the
fact
this
is
much
fresher
anyway
not
sure
i
was
lucky
but
i
tasted
an
excellent
beer
flavorful
balanced
quite
assertive
and
pleasant
to
drink
an
american
interpretation
of
an
english
esb
and
in
my
opinion
very
well
done
aroma
is
mellow
you
pick
up
the
grains
and
some
hop
but
not
a
lot
this
is
also
the
case
with
the
taste
smooth
malty
grainy
with
a
solid
bitterness
but
not
a
lot
of
floral
or
citrus
hop
character
this
is
a
heavier
beer
than
i
expected
with
significant
body
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
many
esbs
or
english
beers
in
general
unless
they
are
firkin
cask
real
ale
etc
this
one
was
a
bit
harsh
and
i
think
it
had
an
oxidation
problem
if
that
was
fixed
i
might
have
scored
it
higher
but
for
now
meh
one
of
these
days
im
gonna
suggest
to
one
of
my
linguistics
contacts
that
a
paper
on
boontling
is
a
good
idea
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
orange
zest
buttery
caramel
and
soft
grass
think
the
lush
hills
of
rolling
verdance
in
the
general
northumberland
area
yeah
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
grass
now
clearly
overshadows
the
evenmilderthanbefore
citrus
character
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
esb
one
of
the
better
ones
coming
from
the
states
more
bitter
than
my
palate
cares
for
and
the
minerally
character
was
overwhelming
malt
flavor
was
pretty
understated
notes
very
drinkable
quite
good
for
a
warm
day
or
even
a
cool
night
cheers
a
rather
enjoyable
little
experiment
this
forcing
a
west
coast
idealism
down
a
traditional
english
bitters
trusting
throat
anyways
the
extra
oomph
here
ensures
that
this
particular
esb
doesnt
fall
prey
to
the
corner
cutting
prevalent
in
such
offerings
of
late
from
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
session
worthy
errrr
maybe
but
by
the
third
round
or
so
one
might
come
to
disagree
even
if
the
robust
flavour
seems
to
indicate
otherwise
this
is
a
very
good
somewhat
robust
example
of
the
style
overall
it
quite
quaffable
despite
the
high
abv
the
head
poured
a
finger
full
of
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
and
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
body
was
a
hazy
orange
color
with
light
carbonation
the
brew
looked
a
little
more
like
a
wheat
beer
to
me
than
an
esb
the
nose
had
a
bit
of
malt
and
some
orange
notes
as
well
this
definitely
didnt
smell
like
a
typical
esb
to
me
the
taste
had
some
bitter
and
grassy
hops
followed
up
with
some
biscuit
and
malty
sweetness
the
nose
wasnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
the
taste
was
pretty
good
the
body
was
on
the
thicker
side
with
low
carbonation
the
finish
was
relatively
quick
this
wasnt
the
best
esb
that
ive
ever
had
but
id
have
it
again
worth
a
shot
overall
complex
it
is
not
it
is
however
a
highly
drinkable
and
very
tasty
beer
its
a
beer
for
any
occasion
simply
because
of
its
simple
yet
rich
flavor
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
copper
hue
with
a
froffy
white
head
about
2
fingers
smells
of
grain
and
very
light
hops
not
very
pronounced
tastes
of
nice
grain
and
hop
balance
with
earth
hop
tones
dominating
in
a
very
tasty
combination
light
bodied
beer
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
expected
a
bit
more
not
terribly
complex
at
the
same
time
not
much
wrong
with
it
a
standardized
esb
for
reference
sake
overall
i
would
consider
getting
this
again
anderson
valley
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
pounding
for
a
long
time
overall
excellent
balance
and
execution
definitely
the
best
esb
ive
had

it
is
an
extremely
well

a
smooth

bubbly
brew
overall
i
like
this
one
it
is
very

the
malty
side
try
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance

pretty
full

beer
maybe
not

its
very
enjoyable
and
fun
to
drink
nevertheless
very
drinkable
but
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
i
would
like
pours
an
amber
with
a
finger
of
light
cream
foam
this
falls
in
a
couple
minutes
to
a
beer
with
moderate
lace
smells
of
malts
english
tone
with
a
bit
of
a
hit
of
bitter
burnt
caramel
this
is
the
nose
i
generally
look
for
in
an
esb
but
this
is
a
little
too
subdued
flavor
is
of
malts
and
a
weird
over
powering
flavor
i
place
akin
to
sushi
wrap
seaweed
really
this
flavor
is
overpowering
anything
else
i
am
tasting
unfortunately
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
with
high
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
im
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
and
would
not
likely
order
again
on
my
own
buck
this

theres
a
pleasing
biscuity

aroma
with
a
hoppy
kick
at
the
end
on
the
flavor
i
find
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
up
front
with
a
pleasing
toasted
biscuit
malt
backbone
that
comes
through
on
the
finish
theres
an

at

not
the

this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of

with
a
prickly

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
probably
get
again
o
received
for
christmas
in
a
gift
pack
with
a
few
good
beers
but
a
60
min
ipa
that
was
a
year
old
so
this
beer
is
at
least
that
but
considering
the
age
not
too
bad
except
for
the
slight
skunkiness
and
the
malt
being
so
forward
o
i
like
it
it
feels
like
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
at
6
8
i
dont
think
there
is
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
responsibly
ps
i
dont
know
if
its
a
joke
or
a
label
misprint
but
on
the
label
it
reads
extra
special
beer
rather
than
extra
special
bitter
interesting
o
i
like
this
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
kinda
like
the
dryness
of
it
o
nice
drinking
well
balanced
tasty
beer
if
your
a

your

of

come
in
towards
the

and
have

them
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
heavy
and
wears
you
down
a
bit
the
more
you
drink
this
was
a
tasty
beer
though
id
definitely
do
another
vthis
beer
poured
out
as
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
scattered
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
character
to
it
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
on
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
reminded
me
a
bit
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
esb
in
my
opinion
the
flavors
were
a
little
sweet
upfront
with
a
touch
of
caramel
that
faded
into
a
strong
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
i
found
to
be
pretty
good
with
a
nice
easy
going
drinkability
to
it
overall
i
like
the
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
i
wouldnt
run
out
to
buy
a
case
though
overall
quite
a
hefty
beer
here
alcohol
comes
through
rather
strong
along
with
some
phenolic
flavors
which
makes
it
slightly
resemble
something
of
the
belgian
variety
could
be
more
balanced
though
overall
its
relatively
bland
o
really
good
esb
but
its
most
definitely
a
west
coast
interpretation
heavy
on
the
hops
for
this
style
but
still
really
nice
beer
o
a
great
drinking
beer
that
i
ended
up
having
a
few
of
although
not
my
favorite
i
love
this
brewery
though
and
while
none
of
their
beers
blow
my
socks
off
they
are
constantly
one
of
my
go
to
breweries
because
everything
they
make
is
so
drinkable
a
good
hop
composition
nearly
an
english
character
but
more
floral
notes
poured
out
with
an
instant
accumulation
of
frothy
head
vibrant
orange
in
color
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
sun
burnt
grass
and
some
bready
notes
some
small
amounts
of
earthy
hops
a
ton
of
malt
on
the
palette
a
darker
malt
but
not
chocolate
roasted
but
not
too
much
there
are
other
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
notes
a
mediumfull
body
and
an
assertive
bitter
hop
dryness
for
a
finish
a
roastedearthy
finish
that
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
esb
its
up
there
was
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
is
very
drinkable
a
must
try
for
fans
of
esbs
unique
brew
to
say
the
least
not
really
my
style
but
worth
trying
overall
drinkability
ha
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
im
still
learning
about
this
style
this
is
my
very
first
so
im
not
sure
how
much
of
a
goto
esb
it
is
everything
is
balanced
well
body
is
clean
and
smooth
and
a
touch
sudsy
alcohol
hidden
well
as
well
a
good
drinking
beer
has
its
place
and
time
drinkability
this
beer
is
pretty
good
honestly
i
thought
it
might
be
a
little
bit
better
its
nothing
bad
decently
solid
worth
a
try
i
guess
to
change
things
up
i
could
have
a
few
no
problem
d
pretty
drinkable
though
fairly
full
bodied
quite
mild
for
an
esb
and
smooth
you
get
the
initial
slap
of
sour
but
it
mellows
quickly
it
has
high
carbonation
with
caramel
undertones
to
smooth
out
the
hops
a
solid
offering
for
any
ipa
or
pa
lover
dokay
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
this
is
the
1st
esb
ive
ever
had
and
it
wasnt
as
bitter
as
i
expected
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
think
ipas
should
be
more
like
this
not
so
strong
on
the
hops
but
nice
balance
of
strong
malt
and
hops
the
malt
just
has
a
familiar
taste
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
drinkability
major
you
could
spend
time
with
a
few
of
these
this
has
a
special
touch
of
beerness

have

its
like
an

with
an
extra
helping
of

a

in
my
opinion
brandon
having
prior
knowledge
and
enjoyment
from
anderson
valley
brewing
companys
delicious
beers
once
stated
that
this
beer
might
be
the
best
ever
sold
at
trader
joes
i
personally
enjoy
almost
every
av
brewing
co
release
and
this
is
among
my
favorites
in
fact
a
trader
joes
employee
once
said
this
is
the
best
beer
we

great

happy

good
brew
notes
from
61304
i
big
beer
in
taste
and
heft
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
inviting
with
caramelized
malt
leading
the
way
with
a
slight
hop
note
the
taste
is
smooth
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
its
definitely
a
big
beer
therefore
not
one
that
i
can
drink
in
great
numbers
very
enjoyable
and
worth
the
buy
overall
i
think
this
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
an
esb
very
malty
with
a
resinous
and
floral
hoppy
finish
i
like
it
and
the
quality
is
unmistakable
but
it
is
too
strong
compared
to
what
i
expect
from
and
esb
and
i
dont
think
it
is
as
drinkable
as
an
esb
is
intended
to
be
d
yep
the
taste
is
caramelly
bready
and
fruity
up
front
fairly
tasty
and
interesting
with
clear
sweetness
that
is
a
little
too
thick
and
unbalanced
but
then
an
overly
strong
bitterness
of
grapefruitpulp
flavour
takes
over
this
bitterness
loses
some
of
its
flavour
but
becomes
more
sharp
and
lasts
through
the
fairly
quick
finish
of
cracker
and
bread
to
leave
a
lingering
overly
bitter
almost
acrid
aftertaste
the
worst
part
is
this
overly
bitter
sharp
grapefruitpulp
end
it
also
lacks
balance
in
that
it
is
simply
sweet
up
front
and
bitter
in
the
end
without
the
two
meshing
this
is
too
bad
becomes
it
has
some
nice
flavours
and
zestiness
up
front
has
a
promising
start
and
has
enough
bitterness
and
sweetness
to
be
interesting
they
just
need
to
blend
and
balance
these
better
and
tone
down
the
sharpness
of
the
bitterness
unlike
any
other
esb
ive
ever
had
certainly
a
california
version
of
the
style
and
it
is
brilliantly
executed
by
avbc
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
can
recommend
it
to
both
existing
esb
lovers
as
well
as
those
looking
to
try
the
style
i
believe
this
is
a
very
fine
example
of
an
american
esb
d
pretty
drinkable
but
needs
a
little
more
balance
in
order
to
receive
a
higher
mark
good
carbonation
a
little
fizzy
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
to
be
sessionable
but
very
enjoyable
altough
on
the
fizzy
side
its
a
pretty
solid
esb
i
felt
a
little
special
at
least
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
way
outside
of
what
an
esb
is
i
would
put
this
under
the
american
ipa
category
mouthfeel
drinkability
diminished
by
noticeable
sweetness
for
style
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
in
england
this
would
be
considered
an
ipa
or
even
more
with
perhaps
too
little
maltiness
in
sum
this
beer
is
too
hoppy
for
my
girlieman
taste
buds
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
esb
by
av
very
smooth
and
medium
in
body
anderson
valleys
esb
is
a
fine
and
refreshing
drink
very
drinkable
and
could
be
a
session
if
it
was
about
1
less
alcohol
a
good
4
seasons
beer
md
crisp
medium
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
i
was
suprised
by
the
hoppiness
although
the
more
more
you
drink
the
more
it
is
like
an
esb
delicious
and
worth
a
try
the
drink
settled
with
a
murky
orange
appearance
with
a
thin
head
but
some
good
lacing
malty
aromas
were
decently
high
but
nothing
else
seemed
to
be
on
the
radar
i
was
surprised
by
the
taste
of
this
esb
much
more
of
a
ipa
almost
bittersweet
hops
were
prevalent
in
the
taste
department
a
pretty
good
carbonation
helped
make
this
a
nice
and
crisp
beer
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
really
deviated
from
an
esb
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
something
i
would
get
all
the
time
might
be
better
with
a
meal
i
may
be
way
off
base
but
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
arrogant
bastard
than
a
traditional
esb
i
like
it
i
like
it
a
lot
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
billowy
head
leaving
nice
lacing
smells
of
toasted
grains
spicy
hops
caramel
lemon
citrus
and
alcohol
the
spicy
hops
hit
the
tongue
first
followed
by
a
deliciously
balanced
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
finishes
very
dry
at
first
sip
this
seemed
overpowered
by
bitterness
but
as
i
drink
more
it
developes
great
balance
the
malt
character
intensifies
with
each
sip
and
i
love
the
complexity
of
flavors
two
big
thumbs
up
here
for
this
brew
and
anderson
valley
its
bahl
hornin
nicely
balanced
not
to
sweet
and
lets
the
hops
do
their
thing
not
a
bad
esb
quite
traditional
in
many
ways
the
beer
is
copper
colored
with
a
nice
creamy
head
lacing
retention
and
modest
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
in
the
mouthfeel
and
has
some
biscuity
and
bready
malt
aromas
and
tastes
the
hops
are
a
bit
biting
a
bit
musty
a
bit
tea
like
in
their
harshness
the
beer
has
some
floral
notes
in
the
aroma
a
definite
sweetness
comes
through
as
well
the
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
a
little
on
the
musty
side
the
acerbic
hop
and
the
biscuity
malt
do
blend
quite
well
the
beer
could
benefit
by
being
more
crisp
and
it
does
have
a
taste
as
though
it
may
have
been
sitting
around
a
bit
too
long
there
is
a
slight
spiciness
to
the
beer
perhaps
it
is
a
peppery
flavor
that
comes
through
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
maybe
lingers
a
bit
longer
than
wanted
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
exceptional
a
decent
esb
has
a
distinct
english
malt
character
certainly
damp
kilned
malts
and
a
soft
carbonation
and
quite
clear
copper
brew
nice
spicy
hop
character
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
pretty
decent
as
far
as
american
esbs
go
really
cant
complain
a
good
representation
for
an
esb
with
good
hop
balance
definitely
worth
a
try
id
call
this
a
cool
american
interpretation
of
the
esb
the
appearance
is
pretty
much
normal
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
and
dry
biscuit
malts
with
peppery
and
herbal
hops
a
big
spicy
hops
flavor
dominates
the
palate
and
develops
into
the
aftertaste
the
biscuit
notes
from
the
aroma
come
out
under
the
hops
with
a
bread
multigrainlike
taste
all
together
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
worth
a
try
for
a
different
sort
of
esb
clear
caramel
color
appearance
with
a
little
under
2
fingers
worth
of
white
foamy
head
it
could
be
the
change
in
temperatures
are
messing
with
my
sinuses
because
i
couldnt
smell
much
from
this
beer
aside
something
a
hint
of
something
sugary
sweet
followed
by
the
aroma
of
hops
tastes
quite
good
you
get
hit
first
with
a
little
sweetness
followed
by
a
a
blast
of
bitter
hops
not
too
hoppy
but
dont
drink
with
something
light
because
it
will
just
get
overpowered
md
very
drinkable
and
the
mouth
feel
is
very
good
with
the
sweet
touch
as
well
as
the
bitterness
that
goes
with
any
esb
d
decent
drinkability
though
nothing
to
exciting
and
wasnt
as
bitter
as
i
expected
leading
to
a
only
moderate
enjoyability
an
okay
esb
and
very
close
to
the
traditional
english
version
good
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
its
tasty
and
easy
on
the
way
down
but
that
6
8
will
catch
up
with
you
eventually
d
this
is
a
killer
session
brew
despite
the
6
8
abv
in
fact
i
was
pretty
surprised
to
see
such
a
high
level
of
booze
in
what
is
usually
a
lighter
sessioningtype
beer
style
and
i
didnt
detect
any
alcohol
in
the
flavor
or
feel
either
well
done
definitely
recommended
the
taste
is
of
molasses
with
a
bitter
end
the
horehound
hard
candy
comes
to
mind
the
bitterness
is
not
overwhelming
and
adds
a
good
balance
to
the
sweetness
this
had
good
drinkability
not
my
style
but
it
had
no
off
flavors
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
think
this
is
the
first
anderson
valley
brew
ive
ever
had
although
ive
seen
them
around
for
quite
some
time
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
small
chunks
of
sediment
floating
throughout
the
beer
like
a
snow
globe
the
head
is
white
and
foamy
but
not
very
active
the
smell
that
comes
to
mind
right
away
is
green
tea
but
there
is
also
toasted
notes
and
a
slight
unidentifiable
hop
presence
the
taste
also
reminds
me
to
a
lesser
degree
of
green
tea
there
is
also
a
definite
hop
bitterness
slightly
grassy
and
floral
that
balances
pretty
nicely
with
the
toasted
malty
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
foamycreamy
carbonation
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
better
than
average
but
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
means
p
s
as
others
have
mentioned
this
beer
is
actually
named
belks
esb
and
not
boont
which
is
avs
amber
it
has
been
reported
d
tart
grapefruit
thats
the
flavor
that
dominated
the
experience
for
me
quite
enjoyable
i
could
easily
drink
another
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
such
a
large
west
coast
esb
i
always
expect
a
quite
a
bit
more
hoppiness
out
of
this
one
if
youre
using
english
hops
then
let
me
taste
them
that
being
said
the
above
negatives
are
only
suggestions
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
a
great
body
i
would
not
suggest
making
it
a
session
lest
the
alcohol
smacks
you
right
in
the
motor
skills
this
beer
poured
a
yellowy
amber
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
a
little
malty
the
taste
is
pleasantly
hoppy
with
some
floral
and
piney
notes
with
a
not
unpleasant
bitter
hop
bite
toward
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
i
would
consider
this
to
be
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
amazing

my
antigravity

great
an
ipa
addicts
take
on
an
esb
good
carbonation
and
medium
smooth
mouthfeel
d
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
esb
that
focuses
a
bit
more
on
the
bitter
than
most
other
esb
offerings
ive
had
nice
floralcitrus
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
with
sweet
malts
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
classic
clean
bitter
finish
very
enjoyable
what
an
unusual
brewery
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
dense
head
stacked
smell
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
specifically
vanilla
vanilla
is
also
the
cheif
trait
of
the
flavor
which
ends
with
a
firm
zippy
saaz
finish
very
creamy
and
fat
throughout
puckers
up
nice
at
the
end
i
would
love
to
know
where
av
gets
this
vanilla
characteristic
from
as
it
is
a
recurrent
theme
in
their
beers
strange
but
nice
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
little
strong
for
the
style
but
still
tasty
and
good
have
a
few
dark
golden
with
a
white
head
dissipates
relatively
quickly
but
never
dissapears
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
smell
is
biscuity
malt
and
some
hop
in
the
background
it
seems
pretty
balanced
to
me
good
malt
character
and
not
to
strong
on
the
hops
although
there
is
a
nice
citrusy
piney
herbal
flowery
and
just
a
bit
bitter
taste
in
the
finish
nice
medium
body
on
the
light
side
of
medium
a
great
choice
for
my
session
beer
at
a
bbq
although
it
may
be
a
little
strong
for
most
12

6
8
abv
is
pretty
high
for
something
i
would
want
in
a
session
beer
if
i
was
served
this
in
a
group
drinking
pitchers
i
would
probably
be
wasted
before
i
found
out
the
real
octane
level
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
could
not
drink
too
many
of
these
maybe
another
bottle
max
interesting
interpretation
here
an
american
twist
to
a
classic
english
style
malty
with
a
touch
of
pacific
nw
hops
the
metallic
tinges
do
not
help
it
overall
its
okay
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
others
of
the
style
or
other
offerings
ive
had
from
this
brewery
overall
an
interesting
zestyflavored
hoppy
beer
that
would
certainly
fit
nicely
with
some
spicy
food
or
hors
doeuvres
by
itself
though
the
aftertaste
is
too
dry
and
cottony
to
have
more
than
one
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
a
mild
grapefruit
hop
taste
of
bitterness
dry
end
and
a
small
hint
of
fruit
clean
and
a
dry
end
but
not
overly
bitter
a
very
nice
bitter
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
hop
presence
i
think
it
might
be
good
for
newbies
that
what
to
try
hops
not
an
esb
ill
be
revisiting
but
an
alright
beer
a
clear
orange
hue
was
the
first
to
make
its
appearance
clear
with
a
sudsy
head
the
smell
was
not
all
that
great
the
taste
was
okay
but
a
little
flat
which
seems
to
be
a
characteristic
for
esbs
at
least
for
me
mouthfeel
was
good
and
it
lasted
quite
a
while
i
will
try
again
to
compare
d
good
drinkability
for
its
heft
another
winner
from
anderson
valley
d
an
enjoyable
well
balanced
beer
the
alcohol
in
this
is
pretty
well
masked
so
be
careful
if
you
are
planning
on
drinking
a
load
of
these
d
another
great
brew
from
anderson
valley
great
esb
highly
recommended
great
drinkability
delicious
overall
a
decent
malty
esb
i
orefer
my
esbs
a
bit
hoppier
and
the
diacytl
didnt
help
out
either
pours
a
slightly
amber
copper
coor
a
little
foggy
with
a
finger
of
white
head
on
top
that
dissolves
fairly
quickly
nose
is
balanced
hops
and
malt
both
show
up
and
a
hint
of
saltiness
in
the
background
definitely
bready
as
well
nose
is
good
but
mild
taste
is
solid
esb
ish
salt
is
what
hits
you
immediately
and
then
again
in
the
fairly
salty
hop
aftertaste
in
the
middle
there
is
that
slightly
sweeter
toffee
malt
flavor
not
bad
feel
is
standard
medium
body
with
solid
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
one
although
the
saltiness
kind
of
a
staple
for
the
style
i
realize
might
limit
the
drinkability
a
little
mediumbodied
and
pretty
complex
going
from
bright
on
the
front
palate
to
a
sweet
middle
act
but
the
hops
are
present
throughout
yet
provide
different
sensations
on
the
way
dense
but
drinkable
and
unlike
any
esb
ive
had
overall
a
nice
entry
into
this
style
i
like
the
balance
and
the
appearance
is
superior
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
and
medium
to
lower
carbonation
smell
is
of
sugary
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hops
taste
is
balanced
with
malts
and
a
little
hop
bite
mouthfeel
seems
good
to
me
crisp
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
medium
drinkability
is
good
as
well
i
like
anderson
valleys
beers
greatly
this
one
isnt
necessarily
the
best
that
they
have
to
offer
but
its
a
good
esb
bottle
courtesy
of
plucier
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
big
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
pnw
hops
is
well
balance
with
caramel
malt
taste
is
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
with
light
toffee
and
some
great
hops
presence
with
provide
mild
bitterness
and
a
great
floral
aspect
to
this
beer
great
carbonation
with
a
full
body
which
really
fit
the
style
i
really
like
and
enjoy
the
balance
in
the
beers
from
this
brewery
notes
my
first
try
of
an
anderson
valley
brew
and
a
solid
esb
with
some
great
unexpected
flavor
characteristics
ill
definitely
check
out
their
other
two
brews
that
became
available
in
my
local
store
recently
dry
finish
but
a
wet
drink
very
clean
no
film
overall
very
dry
biscuity
and
balanced
bitterdry
malt
sweet
hops
quite
good
really
the
defnition
of
what
an
esb
should
be
da
this
is
not
my
favorite
esb
but
its
not
very
hard
to
drink
either
the
is
not
the
most
drinkable
esb
in
my
book
its
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
even
if
it
is
totally
hidden
and
not
so
tasty
that
i
just
couldnt
get
enough
although
its
a
smooth
and
easy
drinker
the
bittering
hops
build
on
the
tongue
and
could
have
used
more
aroma
to
balance
them
out
all
and
all
not
bad
but
not
one
ill
be
buying
again
most
likely
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
not
particularly
wellbalanced
for
an
esb
rather
disappointing
in
fact
i
like
many
of
anderson
valleys
beers
this
one
and
the
belgians
are
not
at
the
top
however
appearance
is
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
with
a
generous
khaki
head
lacing
is
quite
sticking
and
remains
well
throughout
tasting
very
clean
scent
a
little
weak
but
has
mild
hop
aroma
with
a
buttery
undertone
taste
was
much
different
than
expected
hops
appear
powerful
in
smell
but
weak
in
taste
malt
seems
to
overpower
the
flavor
of
this
esb
with
a
fair
hop
bite
to
the
aftertaste
that
remains
well
after
swallow
carbonation
is
quite
mild
throughout
tasting
to
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
esb
at
6
8
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
very
smooth
enjoyable
beer
my
first
brew
from
anderson
valley
and
i
now
look
forward
to
trying
more
in
their
lineup
this
is
avery
nice
esb
i
think
i
will
buy
it
again
taste
is
interesting
with
subtle
notes
of
eggplant
metallic
hops
and
wheat
a
tough
one
to
pin
down
mouthfeel
is
acidic
and
wellcarbonated
with
an
immensely
bitter
aftetaste
some
may
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
especially
extra
bitter
bottom
line
ill
have
this
one
again
at
some
point
in
time
but
im
not
enamorated
with
it
give
it
a
try
it
wont
disappoint
update
less
complex
than
i
remember
buttery
bready
malts
in
the
aroma
and
taste
with
a
gingery
bitterness
balancing
out
the
light
to
moderate
malt
sweetness
simple
but
sessionable
other
than
that
id
expect
more
from
a
beer
of
this
abv
big
thanks
to
wasatch
for
this
one
as
well
much
stronger
than
what
i
expect
from
an
esbactually
stronger
than
their
apa
a
wonderfully
americanized
version
of
the
classic
uk
style
another
brew
obtained
via
wasatch
thanks
bud
mouthfeel
was
stylewise
appropriate
with
mild
carbonation
not
a
standout
in
any
characteristic
but
drinkable
ive
had
a
couple
anderson
valleys
and
havent
been
let
down
yet
this
is
a
really
nice
looking
beer
great
lacing
and
a
head
that
never
dies
down
has
a
slight
oftred
color
with
nice
caramel
malts
to
it
that
are
heavy
fullbodied
flavor
with
some
northern
brewer
hops
kicking
in
at
the
end
to
balance
this
beer
out
a
great
price
a
maltyhoppy
nose
and
a
maltyhoppy
taste
great
offering
im
finding
that
esbs
are
slowy
going
the
way
of
the
ipa
here
in
the
states
and
it
was
refreshing
to
see
this
beer
not
only
be
good
but
rather
true
to
its
roots
another
fine
beer
from
anderson
valley
the
drinkability
is
ok
a
hard
beer
to
brew
and
keep
my
attention
mk
poured
out
a
cloudy
orange
golden
color
topped
by
a
thin
white
lacey
head
not
much
in
the
nose
some
slight
hop
bitterness
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
the
taste
echoes
the
nose
little
bit
of
malt
some
hop
bitterness
spicy
to
some
degree
but
not
much
else
a
fairly
crisp
dry
mouthfeel
good
pleasent
beer
but
nothing
special
overall
impression
definitely
bigger
than
your
average
esb
the
alcohol
is
just
a
bit
to
prevalent
for
this
to
be
highly
drinkable
for
me
pours
dark
amber
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
and
sticky
lacing
relatively
faint
aromas
for
the
style
with
little
in
the
way
of
hop
aromatics
on
the
palate
quite
grainy
first
off
with
hop
bitterness
at
the
midpalate
and
slight
ale
sourness
at
the
finish
full
dextrine
mouthfeel
this
is
a
bit
out
of
character
from
anderson
valleys
other
offerings
as
the
esb
is
perfectly
solid
but
lacks
depth
which
i
see
as
one
of
the
house
characteristics
of
theirs
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
in
some
ways
its
quite
decent
but
i
see
no
reason
to
pick
this
beer
over
some
of
the
other
av
staples
syrupy
and
juicy
flavors
take
over
the
palate
with
hints
of
toasted
grains
black
pepper
spice
caramel
swirls
and
a
freshly
peeled
orange
blend
together
heavy
presence
on
hops
of
this
brew
that
supply
a
biting
snap
finish
this
beer
pours
a
real
beautiful
cloudy
amber
gold
with
a
huge
2
finger
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
very
pungent
with
high
aromas
of
citrus
hops
along
with
a
bready
bisquity
aroma
the
taste
is
very
much
like
an
ipa
with
a
big
hop
presence
citrus
hops
really
dominate
this
beer
with
grapefruit
and
a
buttery
creamy
sweet
malt
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
very
well
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beerone
that
could
be
an
everyday
session
beer
pours
a
bright
goldenamber
color
topped
by
a
creamy
stark
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
in
a
minutes
time
nice
balanced
aroma
of
sweet
fruity
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malt
palate
is
again
wellbalanced
with
tangy
fruity
hops
blending
with
the
mellow
caramel
malt
to
create
a
smooth
enjoyable
flavor
a
bit
of
biscuity
character
is
evident
on
the
smooth
finish
medium
body
is
creamy
and
velvety
great
for
an
esb
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
a
great
session
beer
albeit
just
a
tad
strong
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
a
night
d
very
tasty
and
smooth
to
drink
recommended
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
americanized
version
of
an
esb
flavors
are
bold
but
balanced
and
harmonized
good
job
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
very
nicely
done
anderson
valleys
esb
is
quite
unique
in
their
lineup
it
lacks
the
rich
caramel
maltiness
that
the
pale
amber
and
ipa
have
its
more
bitter
the
alcohol
shows
at
just
6
8
and
its
drier
than
most
theres
a
harshness
to
it
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
its
heavy
handed
with
bitterness
but
lacks
hop
flavor
and
aroma
and
its
not
nearly
as
balanced
as
their
other
beers
that
said
its
still
pretty
decent
just
not
up
to
their
normally
spectacular
level
this
was
my
favorite
esb
of
the
day
anderson
valley
is
a
great
brewery
imo
and
i
will
definitely
be
getting
some
more
of
this
12
oz
single
nice
looking
ale
here
dark
golden
hazy
with
a
large
rockycreamy
off
white
head
good
hoppy
aroma
but
balanced
with
maltiness
smooth
well
balanced
flavour
to
this
one
its
hard
to
really
untangle
the
spicy
hop
from
the
toffeeishcaramel
style
malts
they
sort
of
intertwine
each
others
like
two
rather
slippery
snakes
in
the
end
the
hops
do
peek
out
and
leave
a
nice
long
lasting
bitter
afterglow
nice
mouthfeel
well
done
quite
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
well
balanced
indeed
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
soft
white
colored
head
moderate
level
of
carbonation
was
present
a
bit
of
lacing
could
be
seen
in
my
pint
glass
aromas
of
roasted
malt
dried
fruit
apricot
and
meadhoney
seemed
to
come
out
nicely
the
taste
was
that
of
malt
with
a
subtle
hop
presence
that
grows
over
time
quite
dry
and
a
bit
over
carbonated
in
my
mouth
but
still
good
the
smokedburnt
flavors
also
gained
strength
as
i
continued
to
drink
this
beer
overall
an
good
beer
but
one
that
i
would
not
have
several
of
mouthfeeldrinkability
great
carbonation
active
yet
it
subsides
elegantly
in
the
mouth
easy
and
refreshing
a
bit
too
strong
to
session
but
great
alone
or
with
pub
fare
drinkability
above
average
poured
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
magnificient
white
puffy
head
head
was
extremely
longlasting
and
left
great
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
summer
fruity
with
peach
and
apricot
notes
present
taste
is
sweet
malt
more
summer
fruit
and
a
progressive
hop
bitterness
that
slowly
takes
over
nice
complex
taste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
the
pleasant
sweetness
giving
way
to
the
hops
an
extremely
nice
drinking
beer
i
found
it
creamy
with
delicate
blending
of
flavors
and
very
satisfying
i
think
i
could
session
this
or
at
least
go
through
a
picher
with
no
problem
pours
a
dark
copper
tone
with
a
creamy
head
that
settles
to
a
sticky
white
cap
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
grain
notes
with
a
slight
hop
aroma
as
well
taste
is
hoppier
then
anticipated
but
malts
come
through
and
balance
things
out
nicely
also
noticed
a
slight
alcohol
bite
at
the
finish
this
one
sticks
to
your
palate
after
the
finish
and
actually
gets
better
as
it
warms
dont
know
if
id
drink
more
then
2
or
3
in
a
sitting
but
i
guess
i
shouldnt
rule
it
out
either
only
downfall
for
this
brew
is
that
it
may
be
a
bit
pricey
in
some
opinions
but
still
worth
a
try
otop
notch
bitter
in
my
book
gonna
be
in
my
rotation
right
next
to
the
youngers
special
and
the
sawtooth
excellent
beer
for
an
excellent
price
well
worth
a
try
must
have
a
name
change
on
this
one
as
my
bottle
says
boont
esb
not
belks
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
light
coating
of
head
over
top
and
moderate
clarity
nose
is
moderately
toasty
and
lightly
earthy
from
british
hop
lightly
biscuit
flavor
is
more
aggressive
hops
are
earthy
with
a
light
kiss
of
citrus
playing
over
a
very
strong
toasty
and
biscuit
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
caramel
behind
it
feel
is
moderate
with
a
lightmoderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
id
like
to
see
the
malt
character
be
a
little
more
reserved
as
its
really
aggressive
with
a
bit
more
hop
carry
through
amber
in
color
fairsized
head
dissipates
quickly
to
not
much
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
smells
like
cheese
a
little
pungent
taste
is
well
balanced
with
caramel
malt
and
bitter
hops
all
around
nice
and
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
seek
it
out

and
hopswith
a
bitter

smoothbut
leaves
a
bit
of
a
after
taste
not
a
beer
of
choice
for
mebut
worth
a
try
drinkability
seems
balanced
at
first
but
a
bit
too
much
on
the
hop
side
of
things
tastes
ok
and
drinks
fairly
well
just
wouldnt
be
my
top
choice
or
top
ten
for
thius
style
for
that
matter
quaff
was
malty
and
earthy
with
a
spicy
hop
backbone
finished
with
a
vine
aftertaste
tangy
acidic
on
the
tongue
not
quite
as
es
as
i
anticipated
but
still
a
sturdy
and
drinkable
drinkability
huh
6
8
is
a
bit
high
for
an
esb
but
im
not
complaining
this
stuff
is
gonna
go
down
great
not
many
breweries
do
an
esb
but
i
for
one
can
enjoy
a
nice
extra
special
bitter
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
good
esb
very
drinkable
though
probably
a
bit
too
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
still
maintains
a
nice
clean
balance
lighter
body
and
through
the
roof
drinkability
while
this
is
not
the
jesus
christ
of
esbs
its
a
good
find
and
worth
a
buy
certainly
must
be
smokin
hot
on
tap
i
think
i
got
an
old
bottle
and
perhaps
i
should
try
another
one
before
deciding
that
this
is
not
a
particularly
good
esb
but
the
beer
is
whats
in
the
bottle
and
i
will
review
it
as
such
if
i
try
another
sometime
and
see
a
difference
i
will
update
this
review
for
now
not
a
particularly
good
example
of
an
esb
other
than
the
appearance
if
you
ignore
the
style
this
is
a
somewhat
drinkable
ipa
but
out
of
whack
for
an
esb
imho
overall
a
decent
esb
unfortunately
the
sweetness
practically
ruins
it
you
can
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
or
when
ever
will
drink
again
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
were
more
available
in
my
area
are
all
anderson
valleys
this
good
pours
a
little
hazy
deep
golden
color
some
carbonation
small
head
which
dissapates
quickly
there
is
some
nice
lacing
through
out
the
drink
scents
of
hops
and
malts
very
nice
taste
for
the
style
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
at
the
end
medium
body
another
excellent
brew
from
anderson
valley
do
they
even
make
a
bad
brew
if
so
ive
not
had
one
yet
this
is
very
drinkable
at
6
8
abv
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
this
is
a
nice
twist
on
a
style
that
i
enjoy
simple
and
flavourful
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
definitely
recommended
if
you
happen
to
see
it
at
your
store
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
and
seek
it
out
as
its
not
that
unique
and
you
can
find
several
other
high
quality
beers
of
similar
nature
still
this
one
is
right
up
with
the
best
this
esb
pours
a
cloudy
ambercopper
color
with
only
a
slight
head
the
head
stays
around
for
a
little
while
but
there
is
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
citrusy
the
flavor
has
a
bite
there
is
a
solid
finish
which
stays
with
you
for
a
while
nice
hops
blend
with
the
sweetness
the
bite
of
the
hops
with
the
scent
and
flavor
of
the
alcohol
are
quite
noticable
nice
esb
overall
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
glad
to
try
this
one
not
your
typical
english
esb
but
still
most
drinkable
must
try
a
little
more
agressive
that
the
average
esb
look
is
fine
just
a
little
lighter
rust
color
than
most
low
carbonation
dainty
head
fair
lacing
smells
malty
sweet
and
biscuity
light
caramel
tones
good
hop
spiciness
and
bittering
tastes
lightly
malty
caramelly
and
a
little
toasty
good
dosage
of
spicy
and
bitter
hops
against
light
grain
bill
lends
to
agressive
hopping
for
style
maybe
american
hop
varieties
i
like
it
warming
alcohol
rides
from
sip
to
swallow
finishes
crisply
bitter
lightly
sweet
and
alcoholic
and
slick
like
buttered
popcorn
a
little
less
dry
than
expected
alochol
becomes
a
little
medicinal
in
the
aftertaste
d
very
good
esb
nice
and
strong
anderson
valleys
esb
pours
golden
in
color
with
some
head
that
dissapates
fairly
quickly
very
minimal
lacing
balanced
between
solid
malt
flavor
and
strong
hop
bitterness
nice
crisp
bitter
finish
this
is
my
first
esb
so
i
will
have
to
try
more
to
compare
but
to
me
it
is
like
a
light
ipa
with
little
hop
oil
flavor
and
more
full
malt
flavor
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
i
enjoy
it
paired
with
jarlsberg
cheese
taste
the
bitterness
really
grabs
the
top
of
the
palate
the
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
but
it
sharpens
into
some
hoppiness
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
fine
carbonation
means
it
probably
was
not
forced
or
at
least
it
feels
that
way
which
is
fine
with
me
this
is
quite
drinkable
the
next
time
im
hankering
for
a
good
dose
of
euro
style
hops
and
theres
not
a
high
quality
pils
nearby
ill
most
likely
reach
for
a
belks
overall
great
drinkable
brew
very
complex
with
several
distinct
flavor
layers
are
succesfully
intigrated
into
a
smooth
unifiyng
drink
great
balance
and
a
great
esb
the
first
sip
eliminates
any
doubt
that
this
will
be
a
boring
beer
as
a
full
mouthfeel
and
a
wonderful
dry
malt
profile
mixes
with
hints
of
nuts
and
fruity
sweetness
the
finish
commences
with
a
floral
hop
bite
and
a
long
slow
eurohop
fade
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
giant
white
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
smells
rich
with
spicy
hops
bready
grains
and
alcohol
tastes
very
hoppy
citrus
and
piney
hops
dominate
at
first
but
are
soon
balance
by
a
big
biscuity
malt
the
body
is
meduim
and
the
drinkablity
is
great
what
a
beefy
esb
at
6
8
and
i
do
not
know
how
i
even
found
this
in
nc
it
gets
you
buzzed
really
quick
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
a
hop
background
that
smells
citrusy
the
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
molasses
malt
followed
by
an
herbal
and
citrusy
hops
bitterness
that
lingers
throughout
the
taste
the
hops
flavor
has
hints
of
grapefruit
pine
sap
and
lemon
rind
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
warming
effect
the
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
with
an
almost
7
abv
an
orange
amber
beer
with
just
a
slight
haze
has
a
small
creamy
off
white
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
has
strong
vanilla
and
fruit
notes
with
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
background
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
blast
of
hoppy
bitterness
followed
by
a
nice
caramel
malty
sweetness
and
finishing
off
with
a
smooth
tea
like
bitterness
theres
somewhat
of
an
accumulating
effect
by
the
hops
though
that
dries
the
mouth
out
a
little
much
by
the
end
of
the
glass
so
youre
ready
to
move
on
delightful
though
poured
a
nice
deep
orange
with
a
strong
head
that
is
leaving
a
nice
lacing

is
of
bread
at
of
floral
hops
taste
is
a
great
representation
of
an
american
esb

with
an
extreme
amount
of
malts
and
finishes
with
a
generous
amount
of
floral
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
most
extreme
sampling
of
this
style
to
date
nice
full

this
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
it
gets
better
the
more
it
warms
up
anderson
valley
has
yet
to
dissapoint
me
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
esb
yet
again
anderson
valley
has
wowed
me
quite
sweet
grainy
rough
raw
hops
mediumfull
bodied
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
comes
right
through
a
brash
american
interpretation
of
an
esb
that
leaves
me
wanting
gave
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
poured
to
a
clear
golden
color
with
orange
highlights
had
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
had
some
retention
but
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aromas
of
this
brew
seem
to
be
buttery
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
seems
to
have
very
similar
characteristics
to
the
aromas
definite
sweet
malt
tastes
nice
spicy
hop
taste
that
seems
to
help
this
brew
out
quite
a
bit
also
can
really
notice
a
strong
alcohol
taste
as
it
finishes
not
my
favorite
brew
but
is
pretty
solid
not
sure
if
i
would
get
it
again
i
had
tried
this
on
tap
over
a
year
ago
and
wasnt
really
all
that
impressed
with
it
but
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
alot
better
out
of
the
bottle
poures
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
nice
almost
creamylike
head
head
that
leaves
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
behind
as
it
settlessome
citrus
and
piney
hop
really
come
thru
in
the
nose
with
some
light
caramel
as
well
taste
seems
to
be
more
well
balanced
out
of
the
bottle
there
is
still
a
big
west
coast
hop
profile
pine
and
grapefruit
but
thereis
a
nice
big
firm
slighty
sweet
maltiness
to
it
that
makes
it
a
very
solid
well
rounded
ale
glad
to
not
only
try
the
bottled
version
but
to
find
it
here
in
greensboro
pours
an
orangy
amber
color
with
a
rocky
beige
head
butterscotchy
malt
profile
with
a
moderate
amount
of
hops
in
the
aroma
light
floral
fruitiness
as
well
lots
of
caramel
and
crystal
malts
in
the
flavor
with
a
transition
towards
a
soft
fruitier
spicy
hop
finish
with
some
citrus
suggestions
carbonation
is
average
to
above
average
but
good
for
its
style
its
a
bit
big
for
its
style
too
but
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
by
any
means
bottle
pretty
tasty
esb
firm
mouthfeel
bready
citric
tangy
resiny
hops
failry
english
in
style
an
averagely
drinkable
and
well
made
esb
slightly
aromatic
american
style
ale
but
true
to
the
style
it
is
generally
pretty
english
in
taste
drinkable
stuff
in
the
end
light
orange
in
hue
some
sediment
lurking
slowly
thin
yet
bubbly
white
head
a
spicy
and
hop
based
nose
a
hop
blast
up
front
delicate
malt
based
body
a
bit
carbonated
grainy
notes
with
some
alcohol
offerings
finishes
a
bit
dry
a
pretty
decent
stab
at
the
style
just
nothin
to
write
mama
bout
heavy
duty
esb
nearly
as
big
as
rogues
brutal
bitter
but
in
a
much
different
way
drinkability
the
harsh
bitternes
brings
this
beer
down
a
notch
and
draws
it
out
fo
style
this
one
definately
pushes
the
boundaries
of
an
esb
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
creamy
little
head
on
top
smells
of
hop
oil
and
nutty
malts
grassy
at
times
and
with
a
doughy
bready
hint
in
there
its
pretty
malty
on
the
palate
although
the
bitter
hops
are
definately
there
nutty
flavor
malt
blends
well
with
the
floral
and
also
citrussy
hops
also
has
that
classic
english
esb
buttery
toffee
taste
to
it
which
creates
and
interesting
balance
the
one
thing
i
think
is
the
most
strange
is
that
the
6
8
percent
alcohol
not
particularly
high
seemed
very
noticable
to
me
i
usually
like
that
in
a
beer
but
it
seemed
a
bit
odd
here
and
believe
me
i
really
like
beers
where
you
can
taste
a
kick
of
alcohol
this
really
is
a
pretty
big
honkin
esb
in
my
opinion
definately
unique
and
pushes
the
envelope
of
this
traditional
style
i
like
that
in
a
beer
go
git
some
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
huge
thick
white
fluffy
head
the
head
on
this
lasted
the
entire
beer
and
left
a
great
amount
of
lace
slightly
grainy
nose
with
notes
of
both
citrusy
hops
and
piney
hops
taste
has
some
biscuity
maly
but
the
hops
seem
to
take
over
quickly
spicy
and
slightly
grapefruit
like
hop
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
not
the
esb
i
was
expecting
but
anderson
valley
seems
to
be
all
about
the
hops
medium
body
maybe
a
bit
too
carbonated
overall
a
very
different
esb
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
sure
was
pretty
tasty
i
didnt
think
it
was
as
balanced
as
the
label
says
but
no
matter
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
esb
poured
a
light
and
completely
clear
copper
color
with
a
frothy
pinky
thick
head
with
a
just
a
bit
of
lacing
to
complete
the
package
the
nose
was
dry
smelling
with
notes
of
grapes
butterscotch
and
english
hops
the
taste
was
sharp
up
front
with
some
metallic
hoppiness
that
faded
slowly
into
a
more
traditional
buttery
flavored
english
esb
the
mouthfeel
was
properly
carbonated
without
being
everly
so
good
interpretation
of
an
esb
i
am
an
admitted
esb
lover
this
is
a
striking
attempt
by
an
american
brew
at
an
english
favorite
fullers
adnams
anyone
the
difference
here
is
the
hops
and
carbonation
signature
where
a
lot
of
esbs
may
seem
flat
to
a
lot
of
people
this
one
certainly
is
not
it
has
the
classic
esb
flavour
but
more
bite
on
nose
and
pallate
more
american
i
suppose
excellent
lace
of
head
on
the
glass
smells
like
it
tastes
and
yet
after
leaving
it
out
for
awhile
smells
like
a
clasic
brit
esb
beautiful
color
amberbrown
mixed
hue
though
very
clear
this
is
an
american
take
on
an
english
standard
the
english
types
tend
to
lack
the
bite
this
does
so
imagine
your
sierra
nevada
pale
crashed
a
fullers
party
and
you
have
this
brew
if
you
leave
it
out
to
breathe
for
15
min
at
least
it
settles
more
into
a
traditional
esb
all
around
but
still
has
a
better
hop
signature
than
most
esbs
hop
lovers
will
love
this
out
of
the
12
oz
typical
bottle
as
is
and
immediate
esb
loverstraditionalists
should
let
it
sit
for
a
while
in
a
snifter
before
imbibing
to
enjoy
it
fully
recommended
note
this
is
a
6
8
brew
barely
noticeable
in
the
taste
this
is
the
best
looking
beer
i
have
ever
seen
since
i
began
reviewing
the
carbonations
like
champagne
the
bubbles
flowed
to
the
top
of
the
glass
for
the
twenty
minutes
that
i
slowly
consumed
the
head
also
stayed
a
perfect
quater
inch
until
it
rested
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
had
a
wonderful
aroma
of
fresh
hops
after
that
everything
else
could
have
improved
a
little
too
bitter
even
for
an
esb
a
little
flat
in
term
so
fo
mouthfeel
and
due
to
the
time
it
took
me
to
finish
i
would
have
to
say
the
drinkability
was
below
average
moderately
good
esb
ng
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
pleasant
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
or
carapils
malts
it
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
flavor
layed
over
a
complex
malt
arrangement
it
seems
a
bit
citrusy
but
goes
down
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
esb
it
drinks
well
although
i
prefer
more
malts
and
less
hops
for
this
particular
style
debatable
if
its
a
true
esb
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
drinkability

a
pleasant
surprise
ive
avoided
this
one
for
a
while
because
of
the
cheesy
label
gold
medal
winner
but
this
is
a
quality
americanized
esb
this
beer
however
is
now
on
my
list
for
something
to
try
again
and
may
change
my
mind
about
esbs
overall
a
nice
experience
and
i
easily
slid
into
another
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
i
like
boont
esb
quite
a
bit
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
of
experience
with
the
style
but
this
one
is
solid
across
the
board
and
is
better
than
most
i
could
see
it
in
my
regular
rotation
if
it
was
available
locally
i
really
though
this
brew
had
alot
of
promise
it
looked
great
it
smelled
good
the
carbonation
level
was
spoton
for
the
style
and
then
the
alcohol
metallic
finish
and
overwhelmingly
herbal
albeit
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
ruined
it
for
me
this
is
a
wierd
brew
still
i
think
esb
lovers
would
probably
really
get
into
this
in
general
i
dont
like
esbs
but
this
is
probably
the
best
one
ive
had
so
far
change
the
yeast
and
they
may
have

was

the
nose
was
vibrant
and
bright
presenting
a
nice
array
of
resiny
and
tingly
citric
hop
notes
and
an
underlying
warm
maltiness
the
taste
was
suprisingly
robust
with
a
lightly
tart
toffeeish
malt
body
that
opened
up
with
citric
hoppy
bitterness
which
increased
significantly
in

as
the

decreased

up
with

and

felt

in

from

to

score
a

around
here
very

brew
ends
with
a
very
palette
cleaning
quality
really
more
of
a
complex
ale
than
an
esb
this
esb
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
minimal
light
malt
the
taste
was
fruity
hops
and
sharp
up
front
then
came
the
malt
and
then
a
fruity
hops
finish
there
was
a
touch
of
oak
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
fruity
hop
flavor
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
pretty
good
esb
though
a
bit
more
fruity
than
commonly
found
in
an
esb
this
tastes
just
like
a
pale
ale
and
if
that
is
what
you
are
in
the
mood
for
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
i
was
expecting
something
closer
to
a
classic
fullers
esb
i
mean
hell
the
whole
style
is
based
on
fullers
therefore
i
graded
down
on
drinkability
also
the
6
8abv
is
a
little
high
for
sustained
consumption
this
is
an
allaround
fine
example
of
the
esb
style
hearty
and
well
balanced
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
redbones
last
week
pour
was
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
golden
i
thought
it
had
a
clean
sweet
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
i
thought
the
taste
was
based
on
a
piney
hop
note
the
carbonation
was
slightly
prickly
i
did
not
realise
that
the
alcohol
was
that
high
decent
beer
but
not
overwhelmingly
wow
the
mouthfeel
was
very
tingling
as
the
carbonation
level
seemed
high
bitterness
lasts
long
into
the
finish
i
felt
the
bitterness
got
stronger
after
the
swallow
than
during
the
initial
taste
the
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
a
medium
bodied
beer
nicely
drinkable
for
flavor
but
the
mouthfeel
was
not
as
smooth
as
others
in
the
esb
category
belks
esb
was
a
cloudy

color
with
a
very
substantial
head
that
was
a
little

was
a

was
floral
and
citrusy

a
hint
of
maltiness

it
was
bitter
citrusy
lemon
and
orange
peels
yeasty
and
a

there
was

some

the

could

i
was

trying
this

i
like
evolution
but
then
i
realized
lol
esb
and
passed
it
up
time
after
time
well
after
finally
giving
this
a
chance
i
can
now
say
that
this
is
an
okay
example
of
an
esb
that
fact
i
actually
halflike
this
is
a
minor
miracle
take
note
i
dont
like
esbs
still
theres
a
good
chance
im
going
to
forget
about
this
beer
a
month
from
now
o
a
bit
too
malty
for
an
esb
the
body
is
fine
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
thin
o
the
beer
starts
off
strong
with
straightforward
aroma
and
a
nice
pour
but
just
doesnt
deliver
the
overall
impression
is
that
the
beer
is
unfinished
o
worth
a
try
its
attributes
come
together
rather
well
but
overall
it
could
come
off
as
subdued
for
some
o
3

overall
this
esb
is
surprising
in
how
much
like
an
esb
its
not
that
being
said
its
a
tasty
beer
very
sessionable
and
pleasant
but
nothing
special
either
very
drinkable
every
day
beer
moderate
carbonation
and
a
body
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
with
a
dry
finish
overall
this
beer
is
good
nothing
stands
out
about
it
being
great
though
its
my
first
evolution
beer
and
ive
heard
good
things
maybe
i
just
chose
the
wrong
beer
for
my
first
one
overall
nothing
really
great
here
it
has
a
flavor
profile
that
im
not
in
love
with
but
i
could
drink
a
few
none
the
less
o
its
ok
nothing
great
but
something
that
might
be
sessionable
if
it
were
at
your
local
bar
i
think
the
cidery
flavor
really
is
a
little
too
pronounced
for
me
to
enjoy
it
fully
id
have
this
esb
again
but
probably
not
on
a
regular
basis
pouring
this
into
a
pint
glass
reveals
a
surprisingly
murky
darker
amber
colored
liquid
topped
with
a
12
inch
cap
of
creamy
offwhite
head
that
sinks
to
a
thin
layer
but
still
retains
well
a
bit
of
soapy

aroma
of
grains
and
pretty
much

but
not

for
the

didnt
make
me

after
playing
in

game
good
sign
decent
offering
but
not
one
id
get
again
o
i
found
evos
exile
esb
to
be
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
traditional
esb
but
definitely
has
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
style
i
had
this
one
down
in
rehoboth
on
a
vacation
that
i
was
on
there
i
hadnt
ever
heard
of
the
brewery
so
i
figured
id
give
them
a
try
this
was
the
only
brew
i
could
get
at
the
time
from
evo
so
i
ordered
one
up
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
copperish
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
was
malty
and
had
some
sweetness
of
caramel
to
it
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
malty
dry
and
bitter
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
nothing
too
impressive
overall
this
brew
was
decent
i
didnt
hate
or
love
it
but
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
had
this
on
tap
at
buckleys
deep
copper
pour
2
white
head
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
bready
malty
nutty
and
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
the
taste
follows
the
nose
lingering
bitter
finish
the
body
is
light
medium
good
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
was
easy
drinking
and
it
went
well
with
my
steak
o
when
thinking
of
a
bitter
beer
i
typically
think
of
hop
heavy
in
flavor
this
was
heavy
in
the
malts
and
light
in
hops
not
my
cup
of
tea
still
not
bad
just
wouldnt
drink
it
again
unless
someone
sent
it
to
me
thanks
smokeypeat
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
hazy
copper
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
supporting
its
foamy
head
enticingly
rich
malty
aromas
of
caramel
and
toffee
hit
me
right
off
the
bat
along
with
a
subtle
earthiness
thats
very
appealing
the
caramel
notes
are
extremely
prominent
and
the
overall
impression
is
that
of
a
very
sweet
beer
toasty
malts
take
a
backseat
to
the
more
sugary
and
fruity
notes
the
hops
are
more
complex
on
the
palate
than
the
nose
would
suggest
with
herbaceous
and
faintly
citrusy
notes
coming
in
but
never
quite
balancing
out
the
malts
this
is
certainly
one
heck
of
a
tasty
beer
but
its
lacks
the
balance
that
esbs
supposedly
aspire
to
overall
as
long
as
i
ignore
its
supposed
style
i
like
this
quite
a
lot
its
extremely
flavorful
and
as
pleasurable
to
drink
on
its
own
as
with
food
eep
orange
amber
a
very
dark
color
which
took
me
a
little
by
surprise
to
be
honest
a
very
nice
three
inches
of
head
formed
on
the
top
in
a
good
light
tan
to
off
white
color
great
retention
had
this
thing
hanging
around
for
what
seemed
like
forever
some
sediment
actually
poured
out
of
the
bottom
and
graced
over
the
top
of
the
foam
at
the
end
a
very
hazy
and
cloudy
brownish
amber
this
was
and
it
had
a
very
full
look
to
it
a
very
nice
aroma
of
deep
caramel
malts
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
a
nice
subtle
hoppiness
as
well
though
sweet
the
flavor
was
very
full
almost
a
hoppy
scotch
ale
of
sorts
very
big
with
a
grainy
and
chewy
kind
of
feel
to
it
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
led
to
a
great
rich
feel
and
this
was
just
a
superb
drinker
o
a
middle
of
the
road
esb
i
like
evolutions
lot
3
so
i
will
be
giving
these
guys
another
shot
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
faded
too
quickly
but
did
leave
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
as
expected
a
nice
caramel
and
biscuit
flavor
with
a
nice
hint
of
citrus
hops
that
ultimately
ended
in
a
nice
balanced
finish
the
taste
was
good
well
balanced
a
nice
malt
body
biscuit
with
a
light
hop
the
beer
had
a
medium
mouth
feel
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
special
not
complex
by
any
means
but
a
well
done
beer
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
great
esb
would
certainly
drink
over
others
if
the
choice
was
limited
but
can
drink
far
better
beer
also
than
this
overal
a
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
nothing
complex
simple
and
slightly
boring
o
highquality
esb
good
balance
and
flavor
not
that
great
incredibly
thin
mouthfeel
nice
aroma
but
fails
in
the
taste
quite
disappointed
o
a
little
on
the
malty
side
but
still
comes
out
fairly
balanced
its
ok
nothing
mindblowing
about
it
o
not
bad
but
it
never
really
blew
me
away
it
was
easy
drinking
but
i
am
not
sure
if
it
was
an
old
keg
or
not
but
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
hops
o
very
drinkable
and
would
have
several
others
if
i
had
them
sadley
i
only
brought
one
home
from
de
with
some
others
from
their
brewery
mmm
overall
kinda
meh
yeasty
doesnt
go
well
with
an
esb
and
it
wasnt
very
bitter
the
hops
also
didnt
seem
to
mesh
well
with
teh
overall
beer
and
style
although
the
malts
werent
bad
d
not
as
bossy
as
other
esbs
but
not
a
bad
entry
definitely
gives
the
general
mindset
of
drinking
in
an
old
english
pub
overall
a
great
tasting
brew
with
better
head
retention
and
aroma
characteristics
this
could
be
world
class
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
tasty
and
very
solid
i
like
a
nice
esb
and
this
fits
in
that
category
id
definitely
like
to
have
one
of
these
on
tap
nice
amber
color
head
doesnt
stickl
around
for
long
nice
bready
sweetness
from
the
malts
on
the
nose
followed
by
a
little
hop
profile
taste
resembles
the
smell
but
the
hops
are
a
little
more
prominent
this
time
around
overall
a
decent
brew
fro
evolution
o
very
easy
drinking
and
balanced
i
could
session
a
sixer
of
this
over
the
course
of
an
afternoon
very
good
or
excellent
your
mileage
may
vary
its
damn
good
easy
to
sip
amazing
that
more
brewers
cant
get
down
into
the
low
abv
numbers
brew
beer
this
good
kudos
to
evo
again
the
beer
poured
a
beautiful
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
and
light
floral
hops
the
taste
had
a
nice
biscuity
sweetness
with
caramel
undertones
with
a
nice
floral
hoppy
finish
the
feel
was
light
and
dry
what
a
great
beer
i
have
found
this
scattered
about
throughout
maryland
and
everytime
its
the
same
wonderful
experience
hopefully
the
availability
will
stay
up
as
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
fine
esb
d
long
time
to
pour
but
eventually
settled
down
this
one
needs
some
work
but
the
potential
is
there
o
a
good
esb
to
add
to
the
regulars
it
is
an
easy
drinker
with
all
the
correct
flavors
if
there
is
one
complaint
the
beer
might
be
a
little
green
still
one
that
i
would
accept
without
hesitation
my
eventual
pour
created
a
finger
of
thick
ecru
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
had
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
up
front
with
a
slightly
malty
sweetness
underlying
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
was
a
really
wellbalanced
esb
in
terms
of
flavor
on
the
tongue
there
was
some
bitterness
but
not
enough
to
overwhelm
the
malt
finish
was
likewise
pleasant
slightly
bitter
initially
then
allowing
the
malt
a
chance
on
the
extreme
finish
drinkable
yep
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
malts
taste
is
dominated
by
hops
no
malt
at
all
considerable
bitterness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
overall
its
a
fairly
decent
beer
in
terms
of
its
sum
parts
but
production
problems
leave
it
sloppy
and
unfocused
with
a
limited
drinkability
this
is
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
it
is
a
beautifully
done
recreation
of
this
classic
style
it
is
no
more
or
less
than
a
perfectly
brewed
extra
special
bitter
while
it
is
difficult
to
find
state
line
liquors
in
elkton
maryland
almost
always
has
it
in
stock
d
i
love
the
esb
style
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
after
a
strong
start
in
terms
of
appearance
and
aroma
this
one
quickly
drops
off
not
an
offering
i
would
drink
again
let
alone
recommend
drinkability
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
enjoyed
the
thick
foamy
head
gave
it
a
nice
old
fashioned
feel
after
each
sip
from
my
snifter
i
was
able
to
lick
away
my
foam
mustache
and
enjoy
another
taste
of
this
fine
ale
poured
a
nice
pumpkin
orange
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
left
spots
of
lacing
here
and
there
very
clear
with
bubbles
streaming
from
the
apex
of
the
glass
very
fruity
with
hints
of
lychee
pears
and
white
grapes
touch
of
metallicness
and
honey
flavor
is
highly
fruitforward
with
the
aforementioned
flavors
highly
pronounced
not
much
malt
detectable
except
more
clover
honey
and
bitterness
is
clean
in
the
finish
dry
and
well
carbonated
alcohol
warmth
is
slightly
noticeable
odd
for
a
beer
less
than
6
drinking
like
its
89
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
evolution
and
i
am
impressed
with
what
they
are
doing
d
easy
to
drink
could
definitely
down
a
lot
of
these
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
cap
good
clarity
caramel
light
cherries
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
in
the
nose
light
to
medium
body
with
adequate
carbonation
for
the
style
the
malt
stands
tall
throughout
a
touch
of
biscuity
sweetness
fruit
and
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
they
found
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
fruity
sweetness
left
lingering
behind
the
flavor
is
rich
with
malt
and
has
accents
of
toasted
grain
w
light
cocoa
and
biscuit
sweetness
the
hop
flavor
is
pleasant
and
accents
the
taste
of
the
malt
with
a
gentle
pine
quality
there
is
a
mild
tinge
of
yeast
which
brings
to
mind
orange
rind
and
subtle
apple
notes
w
a
dry
nutty
flavor
following
it
up
i
enjoy
how
the
malt
flavor
becomes
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
w
a
mild
dark
sugar
taste
and
hint
of
wood
in
the
hop
flavor
to
keep
pace
there
is
gentle
stone
fruit
elements
faintly
in
the
taste
w
a
light
coffee
tinge
this
is
a
seriously
good
esb
a
complex
well
brewed
ale
w
high
drinkabilitya
taste
i
could
enjoy
many
of
i
wish
this
were
brewed
closer
to
me
exile
esb
bright
orange
amber
seems
to
be
paler
in
color
than
the
fullers
version
and
without
the
exploding
fruitiness
that
is
characteristic
of
that
london
beer
the
pour
garnered
a
little
bit
of
head
that
quickly
fell
off
the
beer
has
a
rounded
earthy
malt
aroma
that
is
spiked
with
a
little
red
apple
the
beer
is
bready
sweet
with
ripe
fruit
that
gives
way
to
a
balanced
minty
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
chewy
mouthfeel
with
some
contributions
from
tannins
from
the
grain
husk
and
hops
mouthfeel
matches
taste
perfectly
with
the
slight
carbo
and
creaminess
making
this
another
quite
drinkable
brew
from
the
first
state
easy
to
session
in
a
nice
pub
in
new
castle
i
wonder
if
any
carry
this
on
draft
i
imagine
mouth
and
drink
is
on
for
an
american
esb
so
even
carbonation
with
an
apa
and
able
to
drink
a
few
the
taste
was
an
even
balance
between
understated
hops
and
rich
toasty
malt
the
hops
were
rather
delicate
with
floral
and
phenolic
notes
but
little
lasting
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
included
a
little
sourness
and
tang
but
was
overall
pleasant
overall
pretty
delicious
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
could
see
a
sixer
make
its
way
into
my
fridge
if
i
could
find
one
and
im
not
the
type
that
has
the
patience
for
a
sixer
of
the
same
thing
very
simple
and
very
tasty
a
good
beer
from
evo
i
look
forward
to
tasting
some
of
there
other
beers
drinkability
this
isnt
a
tough
bird
to
drink
just
needs
a
bit
of
a
flavour
boost
in
the
right
direction
to
make
things
more
interesting
md
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
alot
of

i
wasnt
expecting
a
pretty
solid

from

i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
decent

i
figure
the

lost
something
in
the

light
brown
muddy

in
the
glass
with
a
subtle

light
body
and
somewhat
spritzy

nothing
really

a
somewhat
onedimensional

definitely
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
ill
have
to
try
it
on
tap
had
this
beer
as
part
of
a
tasting
at
the
brewery
the
5oz
glass
i
tried
had
nice
carbonation
head
retention
and
color
the
aroma
was
good
with
malt
and
hops
that
were
present
but
not
too
strong
for
an
english
style
beer
i
did
think
that
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
were
a
little
too
malty
even
for
an
english
style
beer
it
was
on
its
way
to
having
the
maltiness
of
a
bock
a
little
more
attenuation
would
make
it
a
very
good
esb
drinkability
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
bolder
than
normal
flavors
for
the
style
worth
giving
this
one
a
try
very

this

irons
m
poured
from
a
can
tastes
like
old
style
even
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
overall
pretty
good
typical
british
ale
style
beer
nice
malt
profile
typical
yeast
profile
decent
hops
although
wish
the
hops
came
through
a
bit
more
but
pretty
much
right
where
it
should
be
nothing
too
special
going
on
either
though
just
average
ale
the
pour
was
a
murky
chestnut
brown
with
a
light
orange
hue
and
a
frothy
off
white
head
it
possesses
notes
of
toasted
malts
caramel
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
and
a
light
floral
hop
this
brew
starts
with
a
nice
malty
caramel
flavor
and
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
that
lessens
slightly
giving
way
to
a
mild
hop
backbone
a
smooth
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
brew

definitely
has
the
feel
of
a
decent
bitter
although
the
yeast
isnt
all
that
clean
for
me
i
like
the
idea
but
some
slight
refinement
would
go
a
long
way
eh
really
only
worth
it
for
the
sweetass
label
big
time
maiden
fans
would
be
wise
to
buy
a
bottle
and
just
leave
it
may
i
suggest
they
throw
their
name
behind
something
wicked
and
bitter
as
opposed
to
droll
and
tastless
english
style
session
ale
first
class
wasnt
expecting
much
with
all
of
the
low
ratings
however
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
tasted
almost
like
an
amber
ale
which
are
among
my
favorites
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
plus
its
iron
maide
come
on
i
love
this
british
beer
im
a
big
maiden
fan
so
i
was
drawn
to
the
bottle
too
bad
whats
inside
didnt
match
the
awesomeness
of
the
outside
muddy
color
terrible
head
giggity
not
crazy
about
the
honey
taste
even
though
i
dig
honey
bummer
exactly
this
the
body
is
watery
with
low
carbonation
was
hoping
for
more
a
more
aggressive
taste
not
bad
at
all
just
nothing
memorable
about
this
5
99
pint
was
surprisingly
mellow
and
tame
best
part
was
the
artwork
and
history
lesson
on
the
back
really
good
casual
drinking
lager
plus
its
iron
maiden
inspired
o
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
you
expect
something
aggressive
or
strong
with
a
strong
bitter
style
of
beer
this
one
isnt
strong
nor
bitter
o
2
75
this
is
just
a
timid
beer
the
nose
delivers
the
hope
of
something
good
but
it
ends
there
no
real
flavor
or
feel
on
the
palate
up
the
irons
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
nice
as
i
hoped
it
was
pretty
odd
as
it
was
both
light
and
coarse
overall
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
but
would
be
greatly
appreciated
as
a
gift
this
isnt
a
beer
thats
trying
to
offer
an
intense
experience
or
change
your
life
its
simply
a
traditional
british
bitter
and
a
very
decent
one
at
that
definitely
recommended
whether
youre
a
fan
of
iron
maiden
or
not
nicely
balanced
a
hint
of
toffee
maltiness
that
finishes
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
sad
to
say
i
thought
this
was
not
good
at
all
smells
of
caramel
and
citrus
has
a
smooth
taste
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
bugle
sounds
the
charge
begins
as
a
mopheaded
teenager
i
was
a
huge
iron
maiden
fan
so
i
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
i
purchase
one
from
time
to
time
when
i
have
a
hankering
for
simpler
times
really
this
is
a
decent
british
bitter
nothing
special
just
a
good
pint
like
you
would
find
on
tap
at
any
pub
i
find
the
malthop
balance
quite
pleasant
and
the
finish
is
nice
and
dry
this
beer
is
best
suited
to
cranking
up
some
british
metal
throwing
on
the
1980s
concert
shirt
and
letting
er
rip
with
your
mates
cmon
dickinson
overall
not
a
bit
bitter
its
just
missing
some
of
the
depth
and
complexity
of
others
in
the
style
worth
a
shot
and
has
awesome
iron
maiden
artwork
to
boot
serving
type
bottle
while
wearing
a
trooper
beer
tshirt
while
listening
to
the
trooper
hellz
yes
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
a
couple
fingers
of
creamy
lightkhaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
berries
light
green
apple
mild
biscuit
and
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
biscuit
malt
mild
grass
flowers
light
stonefruits
and
a
twinge
of
green
apple
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
rather
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
pretty
damn
solid
brew
im
not
entirely
sure
it
lives
up
to
the
bombast
of
its
sametitled
song
but
it
certainly
provides
an
enjoyable
experience
overall
could
do
with
just
a
bit
more
caramel
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
esb
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
friends
first
off
bought
this
as
a
novelty
because
i
love
me
some
maiden
kept
the
bottle
around
a
while
so
i
was
not
sure
if
the
taste
would
be
totally
fresh
or
not
what
i
will
say
is
that
all
novelty
factor
aside
this
beer
rocks
it
is
extremely
smooth
the
right
mix
of
carbonation
foam
and
lace
mixed
with
a
soft
aroma
of
hops
very
well
pleased
and
totally
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
is
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
clean
and
not
bitter
at
all
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
surprises
i
have
tried
in
a
long
while
hope
to
find
more
soon
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
medium
white
head
moderate
lacing
aroma
and
taste
is
grass
with
grain
undertones
citrus
and
fruity
notes
upfront
yeast
bready
and
lightly
toasted
biscuit
malt
a
medium
body
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
same
as
taste
with
some
mild
hops
bitterness
on
the
end
for
balance
not
the
best
esb
but
it
slowly
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
overall
still
crisp
and
slightly
refreshing
an
ok
brew
overall
this
is
an
ok
esb
but
it
doesnt
really
blow
me
away
its
got
a
bit
of
a
generic
character
and
is
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
pretty
decent
beer
love
the
label
too
the
main
problem
is
that
it
is
all
hop
and
no
midpalate
there
should
be
more
maltiness
to
fatten
out
the
flavour
but
the
hops
are
too
dominant
and
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
much
it
drinks
well
though
and
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
balanced
well
enough
keeping
the
bottle
pretty
decent
beer
even
though
label
is
way
way
better
than
the
beer
tastes
better
while
listening
to
iron
maiden
dark
color
was
hoping
for
more
with
this
brew
but
hey
its
a
bands
beer
i
expected
a
rather
disappointing
beer
while
looking
through
the
other
reviews
well
it
wasnt
too
disappointing
but
its
a
shame
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
didnt
live
up
to
what
the
appearance
and
aroma
suggested
okay
for
what
it
is
which
seems
to
me
more
of
a
marketing
thing
with
its
iron
maiden
label
theme
rather
than
a
really
good
beer
for
the
style
strong
presentation
but
weak
flavored
a
bit
boring
for
being
an
esb
i
think
not
bad
just
what
i
was
expectingi
think
the
english
do
better
smooth
ales
appearance
is
crystal
clear
amber
with
an
appropriate
head
smell
is
nothing
special
but
for
this
style
i
dont
expect
it
to
be
this
is
an
easydrinking
well
balanced
british
ale
that
tastes
like
a
british
ale
should
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
marred
only
by
the
high
price
tag
o
i
have
noticed
that
every
beer
label
that
has
to
proclaim
itself
a
premium
beer
is
usually
not
good
this
is
no
exception
well
done
beer
balanced
classic
easy
to
drink
overall
an
okay
beer
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
even
enjoyable
on
this
hot
summer
day
just
so
much
better
stuff
out
there
really
cool
bottle
and
band
nostalgia
if
your
into
iron
maiden
even
remotely
i
would
definitely
grab
it
iron
maiden
will
it
have
me
screaming
for
vengeance
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
very
bready
malt
smell
pours
to
a
deep
golden
brown
with
a
three
finger
head
that
has
a
creamy
top
on
the
taste
i
get
a
nice
balanced
slightly
bitter
solid
brew
that
is
common
but
tasty
mouthfeel
is
solid
if
any
beer
is
a
sessioner
its
this
one
nice
abv
4
7
and
good
ordinary
but
inoffensive
taste
for
an
everyday
drinker
this
one
is
a
winner
appearance
is
amber
and
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
with
a
hint
of
lemon
taste
is
bitter
and
has
a
light
aftertaste
to
it
iron
maiden
trooper
is
a
good
beer
has
plenty
of
character
but
i
found
the
aftertaste
a
bit
underwhelming
i
would
say
that
trooper
is
a
type
of
beer
that
takes
its
time
to
get
used
to
in
other
words
the
more
you
have
have
it
the
more
youll
enjoy
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
decent
flavors
and
aromas
ferocious
brand
and
label
but
a
very
mild
and
inoffensive
beer
poured
from
500
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
june
2014
overall
being
a
big
iron
maiden
fan
i
wanted
this
to
be
a
great
beer
but
it
is
only
a
soso
esb
at
least
the
bottle
will
make
the
display
in
the
music
room
o
okay
beer
but
not
something
i
will
revisit
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
kind
of
mild
malts
some
citrus
very
light
hops
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
warm
weather
beer
but
it
gets
a
full
extra
5
points
because
it
has
frickin
eddie
on
the
bottle
overall
an
average
beer
but
i
didnt
buy
it
for
any
reason
but
the
bottle
impressive
its
accessible
enough
for
even
the
most
uninitiated
of
drinkers
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
for
the
beer
savvy
tastes
more
like
a
euro
pale
lager
than
anything
else
im
not
crazy
about
it
but
it
would
probably
be
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
a
deck
worth
a
try
half
pint
at
spoons
as
part
of
their
latest
real
ale
festival
a
dark
amber
colour
with
a
nose
which
reminds
me
of
peach
but
is
also
floral
an
overly
negative
spin
on
it
would
say
it
sounded
like
an
old
ladys
bathroom
the
taste
is
rather
a
let
down
after
that
rather
soapy
reminding
me
of
apples
the
only
plus
point
is
a
hint
of
nuttiness
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
quite
a
good
beer
though
its
quite
expensive
for
what
you
get
o
overall
fairly
clean
malt
profile
lightly
dry
flowery
easy
drinkability
though
not
neccessarily
exciting
can
be
a
respectable
light
lager
style
drink
with
some
hop
appeal
but
hard
to
imagine
this
as
as
an
esb
and
yes
im
going
to
keep
the
bottle
its
gonna
be
displayed
on
a
shelf
in
the
mancavebrewhaus
not
bad
but
not
great
im
not
particularly
experienced
with
many
english
style
ales
so
i
can
only
speak
to
the
overall
taste
and
experience
rather
than
putting
it
in
context
against
style
its
certainly
not
bad
i
have
no
idea
how
it
has
been
received
in
the
uk
at
4
7
i
could
drink
this
frequently
if
it
were
on
draft
but
i
wont
again
shell
out
5
a
bottle
stateside
a
beer
that
is
probably
selling
so
well
more
because
of
its
label
and
tribute
to
iron
maiden
than
because
of
the
beer
inside
the
bottle
but
the
beer
itself
isnt
at
all
bad
and
is
in
fact
a
nice
example
of
the
english
bitter
or
pale
ale
style
coppery
in
color
with
great
carbonation
and
a
sudsy
white
head
the
grains
come
in
ahead
of
the
hops
in
both
nose
and
taste
but
this
is
a
display
of
balance
mineral
heavy
on
the
grain
front
copper
and
tin
as
it
swallows
but
the
hops
brighten
it
up
and
actually
put
a
lot
more
fruity
flavors
into
this
beer
than
most
of
the
traditional
english
buttering
hop
types
i
most
enjoy
the
feel
though
which
is
robustly
carbonated
and
creamy
on
the
palate
very
hearty
and
satisfying
and
while
the
flavors
arent
my
favorite
i
appreciate
the
session
ability
of
this
english
pale
at
under
5
its
on
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
still
medium
buried
at
least
and
long
finishing
good
not
great
all
up
pours
a
bright
brassy
color
with
a
loose
head
of
sticky
white
bubbles
sweet
toasty
toffee
biscuit
honey
cherry
and
fruity
yeast
aromas
with
a
bit
of
hops
toasted
grain
lemon
tea
nuts
and
a
floral
earthy
hop
bitterness
mediumlight
and
dry
a
little
watery
in
the
finish
not
bad
pretty
simple
and
could
use
a
better
malt
profile
but
a
solid
little
mellow
esb
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
on
cask
scream
for
beer
i
had
high
hopes
for
trooper
and
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
it
both
as
a
devout
metal
head
and
a
fan
of
the
british
brewing
tradition
unfortunately
i
found
it
to
be
highly
unremarkable
and
in
general
highly
disappointing
will
have
to
buy
another
bottle
from
a
different
source
as
i
suspect
this
one
was
mishandled
the
flavor
was
not
consistent
at
all
with
a
premium
british
beer
vague
watery
more
aftertaste
than
flavor
closer
to
budwieser
than
beer
with
none
of
the
complexity
and
well
defined
flavor
reported
in
other
reviews
o
an
enjoyable
session
beer
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
that
stands
out
lots
of
malt
with
just
enough
a
woody
spicy
english
hop
75
overall
a
bit
watery
with
some
less
than
appealing
flavors
in
the
finish
really
could
use
a
fair
bit
more
carbonation
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
theres
now
way
im
going
to
pay
5
50bottle
when
i
can
get
a
6er
of
fullers
for
10
recommended
if
cost
is
not
a
factor
flavorful
easy
drinking
tasty
and
refreshing
ignore
the
ratings
this
is
a
damn
good
esb
the
flavors
are
somewhat
subdued
but
that
helps
make
this
brew
smooth
and
sessionable
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
foamy
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
aroma
of
butterscotch
and
toffee
with
an
herbal
element
in
the
taste
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
give
way
to
a
lemony
citrus
lingering
into
a
woody
dryness
lemon
citrus
toffee
and
wood
dry
tannic
finish
on
a
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
up
the
irons
and
the
beers
pretty
decent
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
options
within
the
style
clear
copperamber
pour
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
minimal
retention
with
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
typical
for
the
style
with
lots
of
bready
malt
and
caramel
along
with
hints
of
butterscotch
apple
and
subtle
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
bready
and
malty
with
hints
of
butter
tea
apples
caramel
toffee
biscuit
and
mild
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
buttery
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
subtly
bitter
finish
overall
the
label
is
definitely
better
than
the
beer
but
its
a
solid
sessionable
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
just
okay
and
definitely
not
worth
the
price
perhaps
a
decent
beer
to
get
macro
drinkers
away
from
budweiser
etc
trooper
ale
isnt
bad
enough
to
have
you
for
the
hills
but
like
so
much
heavy
metal
is
something
you
grow
out
of
pretty
quickly
the
odd
surge
of
lemony
floral
hops
doesnt
make
up
for
the
austere
maltiness
the
only
head
banging
this
tedious
ale
induces
is
against
a
wall
this
beer
didnt
try
to
be
that
it
wasnt
the
boozy
metal
tasting
dreg
it
could
have
been
instead
it
is
subtle
in
all
respects
not
over
the
top
in
any
area
just
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy

with

draws
fans
of

to
try
craft
beer
even
though
it
does
lack

it
is
not
watery
or
metallic
so
points
for
that
cheers
overall
this
is
a
straightforward
traditional
beernot
bad
but
not
really
great
either
will
we
next
see
aces
high
or
run
to
the
hills
well
im
a
big
fan
of
iron
maiden
and
that
was
enough
for
me
to
want
to
taste
this
beer
and
for
my
big
surprise
it
is
fucking
outstanding
i
mean
it
comes
in
a
very
cool
bottle
and
all
but
it
actually
tastes
really
good
it
is
kinda
sweet
very
smooth
and
although
the
alcohol
percentage
is
quite
high
you
cant
get
easily
drunk
with
this
one
totally
recommend
it
pours
lightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
good

long

head
the
sticks
a
moderate
amount
of

on

aromas
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
hints
of
butterscotch
a
bit
of
light
fruit
and
a
touch
of
mineral
and
sulfur
the
flavor
is
rich
and

lots
of
darker

earthy
and
citrus
hop
flavor
with
a
firm

bitterness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sweet
mouthfeel
decent
english
ale
i
could
drink
this
without
too
much
of
a
problem
this
is
a
light
bodied
ale
and
overall
its
ok
nothing
seems
to
stand
out
but
it
does
go
down
easy
a
bit
more
flavor
would
be
nice
o
ah
well
ill
always
have
the
bottle
to
remember
this
beer
by
no
seriously
though
at
5
its
a
terrible
value
but
if
these
were
23
or
so
id
have
one
every
now
again
probably
should
have
let
it
warm
a
bit
more
to
get
that
british
mild
feel
but
otherwise
a
very
very
average
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
light
coppergold
coloring
with
a
filmy
sparse
white
surface
coat
of
head
aromas
of
toffee
sweet
tangy
caramel
toasted
notes
and
floral
highlights
very
sweet
nose
flavors
are
toffee
rich
and
sweet
forward
with
a
roasted
backbone
some
bitter
undertones
and
a
very
mild
hops
presence
there
are
hints
of
citrus
notes
at
the
very
end
of
the
brew
but
more
acidic
than
anything
midbodied
but
slightly
effervesced
by
the
slow
carbonation
giving
it
a
sharp
filmy
feel
at
times
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
sweet
and
roasted
malt
notes
the
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
fairly
unremarkable
ill
start
by
saying
being
a
huge
maiden
fan
that
i
bought
this
for
the
bottle
it
could
have
eddies
piss
in
it
and
i
still
would
have
bought
it
pours
a
brown
copper
color
not
much
head
smell
is
bread
and
malt
faint
smell
of
hops
smells
like
boddingtons
to
me
taste
is
typical
english
ale
biscuits
malt
not
much
hop
kinda
tangy
which
is
odd
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
not
sure
eddie
would
drink
it
up
the
irons
overall
a
pretty
average
brew
some
diacetyl
would
have
been
nice
as
would
have
been
the
advertised
lemon
hints
it
is
nice
to
see
eddies
branching
out
overall
drinkability
not
bad
not
great
again
a
decent
session
the
name
makes
it
attractive
enough
i
guess
this
beer
probably
put
robinsonsunicorn
on
the
map
and
introduced
them
to
a
wider
audience
too
bad
the
beer
wasnt
better
overall
as
expected
a
very
average
passable
english
ale
that
proves
that
one
should
avoid
any
beer
endorsed
by
musicians
not
bad
stuff
but
certainly
not
brilliant
and
the
incredibly
high
price
is
simply
laughable
all
things
considered
one
to
avoid
o
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
and
i
gotta
say
theres
not
much
to
it
there
is
absolutely
nothing
offensive
in
here
but
it
tastes
like
a
pretty
standard
if
not
weaker
esb
cool
label
art
but
nothing
special
inside
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
40
degrees
hoping
i
had
something
great
uhhh
no
not
really
at
all
the
beer
was
amber
in
color
looked
okay
except
for
the
fact
it
had
noo
head
at
all
the
headless
beer
the
beer
was
flat
tasting
with
a
little
bit
of
a
malty
taste
nope
not
going
to
buy
again
o
a
good
example
of
the
esb
that
isnt
fullers
that
is
fruitier
and
hoppier
not
maltforward
also
a
good
example
because
its
definitely
the
english
brand
of
the
style
no
extraadded
hops
or
americanized
alpha
acid
kick
very
traditional
and

with

bitter

pith
and
dish
soap
all
culminates
in
a
steely
shallow
end
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
the
flavor
of
this
ale
is
more
of
an
ordinary
bitter
not
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
taste
up
front
the
malt
adds
a
sweetness
to
balance
the
slight
piney
herbal
hops
in
the
mix
but
the
yeast
is
the
main
flavor
giving
the
bitter
more
of
a
mineral
aspect
and
some
spiciness
but
mild
fruitiness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
traditional
take
on
an
english
style
drinkable
but
more
of
a
novelty
with
the
iron
maiden
label
there
are
others
that
may
be
just
as
good
or
better
i
found
the
use
of
bobec

interesting

there
is

pleasant

classic

kickass
label
on
the
bottle
overall
a
good
example
of
an
esb
and
a
good
session
beer
although
i
always
considered
esbs
a
great
session
type
of
beer
there
are
many
examples
out
there
that
spoil
the
fun
i
thought
trooper
only
had
a
pretty
label
but
it
wasnt
the
case
more
than
decent
esb
great
example
as
with
so
many
great
beers
if
you
try
drinking
this
beer
super
cold
youll
miss
out
not
sure
this
beer
should
be
classified
as
an
esb
its
flavor
profile
is
more
like
a
pale
ale
still
its
a
solid
rocker
and
worth
a
try
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
english
ales
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
i
can
see
this
flying
off
the
shelves
here
in
alberta
with
all
the
closet
maiden
fans
that
reminds
me
watch
flight
666
its
one
of
the
greatest
rock
docs
ever
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
in
an
iron
maiden
beer
good
for
the
lovers
of
english
ale
that
cannot
get
it
close
to
the
source
for
an
esb
this
does
well
not
to
embarrass
itself
bringing
the
biscuit
and
wielding
the
hops
like
a
musket
maybe
a
tad
sweet
for
the
style
and
more
generally
for
extended
sessions
but
agreeable
enough
as
a
onefer
in
the
world
of
promotional
or
popcultural
tieins
and
fade
out
with
to
tame
a
land
simply
an
average
brew
overall
simple
but
sufficient
if
a
bit
pricey
overall
this
what
i
expected
a
solid
english
ale
meant
for
drinking
in
mass
quantity
at
a
pub
bruce
would
not
put
out
a
shit
product
and
this
was
a
solid
english
brew
not
sure
why
its
listed
under
esb
in
ba
as
it
seems
more
like
an
ale
or
rich
lager
to
me
but
either
way
it
tastes
and
drinks
very
british
nothing
exciting
but
easy
to
drink
o
this
required
a
doublecheck
of
the
label
it
clearly
says
ale
but
this
really
drinks
more
like
a
lager
as
an
esb
as
listed
here
i
dont
see
that
indicated
on
the
label
its
even
less
appealing
it
really
isnt
particularly
good
nothing
id
say
you
need
to
avoid
but
nothing
to
even
consider
going
out
of
your
way
for
o
a
serviceable
drink
for
sure
but
probably
not
one
that
draws
notice
save
for
by
virtue
of
the
label
and
name
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
but
not
exceptional
good
overall
british
beer
nothing
that
wowed
me
but
it
is
real
nice
and
easy
to
drink
id
love
to
see
some
metalheads
at
a
maiden
show
drink
this
beer
i
just
dont
know
if
the
price
put
on
it
would
justify
drinking
it
in
my
necks
of
the
woods
in
the
us
it
was
a
little
over
5
00
so
in
that
sense
not
good
for
what
you
get
but
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
overall
it
just
was
mostly
like
an
esb
and
not
unique
enough
to
stand
apart
from
the
rest

500
ml

amber

leaves

sticks

the

and

not
bad
but
very
onedimensional
maybe
to
please
everyone
but
a
beer
you
drink
easily
o
definitely
on
the
british
side
of
an
esb
drinking
this
more
for
the
novelty
of
the
iron
maiden
part
but
its
actually
a
pretty
decent
esb
5
isnt
too
bad
at
all
to
get
a
sweet
bottle
containing
some
brew
regardless
of
how
good
or
bad
it
is
if
youre
a
fan
of
iron
maiden
its
a
good
purchase
the
reminds
me
of
the
bristish
ales
served
in
every
little
pub
throughout
london
weak
in
body
and
flavor
but
with
an
easiness
that
serves
a
day
of
drinking
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
that
was
very
true
to
style
it
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
better
english
beers
ive
had
with
that
really
malty
flavor
and
signature
english
ale
yeast
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
or
two
would
be
enough
for
me
i
think
more
than
that
and
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
its
just
a
good
example
of
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
one
dimensional
it
was
i
think
a
little
more
hops
would
add
some
balance
and
more
complexity
to
this
brew
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
it
often
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
who
like
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
it
simple
and
malty
i
would
think
a
darker
more
extreme
beer
would
better
suit
the
persona
of
this
band
but
this
is
probably
the
style
they
enjoy
drinking
so
i
cant
knock
them
for
that
this
made
for
a
decent
first
impression
for
this
brewery
and
ill
be
interested
to
see
if
they
put
out
anymore
iron
maiden
beers
for
a
bottled
english
esb
this
one
is
quite
decent
oreminds
me
of
one
of
my
first
attempts
at
home
brewing
pretty
displeased
with
this
offering
o
not
bad
a
drinkable
effort
for
sure
maybe
a
bitt
too
sweet
and
light
bodied
though
o
an
esb
isnt
exactly
a
complex
style
to
begin
with
and
trooper
isnt
a
super
example
of
it
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
very
exceptional
kind
of
a
novelty
presumably
if
youre
an
iron
maiden
fan
youll
have
a
different
opinion
of
it
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
halffinger
fine
white
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
nice
aroma
of
bready
lightly
biscuit
malt
light
caramel
and
light
citrus
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
follows
milder
than
the
aroma
with
biscuit
malt
lightly
grainy
mild
grassy
hops
light
citrus
finishes
with
a
brief
amount
of
stone
fruit
and
citrus
with
light
lingering
grassy
hops
light
bodied
a
fairly
standard
light
esb
with
perhaps
a
bit
more
fruit
juice
flavor
but
mild
hops
and
malt
a
bit
too
lightly
flavored
to
be
very
interesting
a
satisfactory
light
esb
that
would
not
stand
out
without
the
iron
maiden
backstory
kind
of
odd
for
me
to
have
a
heavy
metal
band
naming
a
light
almost
bland
esb
but
i
guess
those
guys
are
old
enough
to
settle
down
and
yell
at
kids
in
their
yard
just
a
little
incongruous
not
even
as
good
as
the
opening
riff
but
not
many
things
are
i
almost
ignore
the
trooper
moniker
as
all
i
can
think
is
eddies
back
with
his
abrasive
and
in
your
face
attitude
i
was
looking
for
a
beer
to
suit
instead
we
are
merely
rewarded
by
a
pleasant
and
highly
rewarding
crisp
and
refreshing
ale
no
wonder
eddie
looks
so
pissed
off

very
good
i
thought
the

zest
was
quite
refreshing

iron
maiden
is
one
of
my
favorite
bands
great
beer
o
nothing
outrageous
but
nothing
offensive
a
decent
drinking
brew
but
i
really
just
bought
it
for
the
gimmick
if
i
was
forced
to
drink
this
again
i
wouldnt
be
unhappy
than
trooper
a
bit
of
a
novelty
beer
for
those
metal
enthusiasts
out
there
you
would
think
this
beer
would
have
been
an
aggressive
imperial
stout
or
something
more
extreme
for
a
bottle
donning
an
iron

nothing

with
this

ale
with

head
leaves
behind

speckled

on
the
sides
of
my
chalice
aromatics
are
nice
earthy
cereal
malts
with
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
from
the
hop
additions
the
fruity
esters
bring
out
hints
of
cherry
with
caramelized
sugars
bringing
some
perceived
sweetness
as
well
flavor
is
okay
a
nice
solid
british
ale
fruit
adds
some
complexity
a
zing
of
hops
but
seems
less
cohesive
and
flavor
forward
than
i
enjoy
its
hard
to
knock
it
but
it
doesnt
excite
me
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
a

on

washes
most
of
any

on

away
overall
a
beer
i
cant
picture
purchasing
unless
it
was

a

but
it
was
still
nice
to
try
this
one
o
nothing
special
about
the
beer
but
man
the
label
kicks
ass
this
one
is
going
on
the
shelf
this
esb
from
robinsons
was
alright
at
best
nothing
memorable
about
the
beer
except
for
the
label
overall
a
very
good
bitter
and
it
was
fun
reminiscing
about
my
old
metal
days
from
the
80s
whilst
enjoying
this
one
youll
take
my
life

ill
take
yours
too

some
maiden
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
clear
rich
golden
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
was
gone
in
a

colordissapointing

aromas
of
deep
caramel
biscuit
and
hint
of
brown
sugara
faint
green
applelike
sourness
as
well
a
light
mouthfeel
near
being
watery
but
not
quite
nice
flavors
for
what
it
isa
subtle
english
esbcaramel
and
buttery
tones
with
a

of
ironthe
green
apple
notes
come
through
again
in
the
finish
along
with
a
light
smattering
of
leafy
hops
the
beer
is
eh
okthe
band
kicks
ass
and
the
charge
of
the
light
brigade
was
very
heroic
o
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
sessionable
and
has
an
excellent
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
up
the
irons
o
this
is
a
classic
example
of
an
esb
nice
fruity
malt
flavors
and
aromas
with
just
a
light
hint
of
hops
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
bet
this
would
be
really
nice
on
cask
wish
i
was
over
in
the
uk
getting
this
at
a
pub
but
alas
im
sitting
at
home
drinking
it
from
a
bottle
i
had
to
pick
this
up
as
i
was
huge
iron
maiden
fan
in
the
late
1980s
and
still
listen
to
them
when
doing
yard
work
bottom
line
cool
bottle
if
your
a
maiden
fan
this
is
a
must
have
overall
garbage
flavorless
sucks
i
bought
this
cause
its
a
iron
maiden
beer
but
jesus
christ
did
the
band
drink
this
first
then
agree
on
it
or
was
it
just
them
saying
they
can
use
our
name
and
thats
all
they
had
in
it
almost
5
for
one
of
the
lightestflavorless
beers
outside
a
american
macro
ive
ever
had
this
beer
sucks
and
f
you
robinson
brewing
for
associating
this
beer
with
iron
maiden
okay
so
i
admit
it
i
bought
this
beer
because
of
the
iron
maiden
art
on
the
bottle
esbs
are
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
american
ipas
and
i
do
not
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
them
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
enjoyable
and
refreshing
im
not
sure
its
meant
to
be
anything
more
than
that
i
like
to
combine
my
favorite
things
in
life
and
i
cannot
wait
to
open
this
on
the
finish
of
my
next
iceclimb
in
new
hampshire
the
next
time
i
drink
this
ill
be
listening
to
piece
of
mind
on
vinyl
o
ok
drinkability
but
very
far
from
the
classic
and
original
songs
of
iron
maiden
meh
a
disappointment
looks
ok
but
the
aromaflavour
are
dull
and
uninspired
while
the
body
doesnt
offer
much
to
sink
your
teeth
into
coming
from
robinsons
i
suppose
i
should
have
expected
this
but
i
was
hoping
that
the
iron
maiden
connection
might
make
for
a
more
uncompromising
brew
oh
well
no
need
to
rush
out
and
buy
it
this
beer
didnt
really
offer
much
out
of
the
ordinary
it
was
pleasant
enough
but
nothing
stuck
out
and
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
where
pretty
light
and
hard
to
detect
pours
a
clear
copper
color
23
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
caramel
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
hint
of
earthy
malt
hint
of
yeast
slight
hops
hint
of
tea
and
a
hint
of
sugar
fits
the
style
of
an
extra
special
strong
bitter
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
earthy
malt
caramel
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
slight
subtle
hops
and
a
hint
of
yeast
my
wife
says
it
tastes
like
dirty
socks
nice
tasting
but
nothing
special
not
good
at
all
had
a
strange
metallic
taste
to
it
aroma
was
decent
but
completely
fell
apart
when
i
tasted
it
o
nice
balanced
ale
well
done
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
this
tastes
like
other
esbs
that
ive
tried
it
pours
nicely
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
and
displays
some
head
and
lacing
but
when
i
tried
it
with
a
nonic
there
was
virtually
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
color
is
amber
with
a
hint
of
orange
the
taste
and
aroma
are
hard
to
describe
but
i
would
lean
toward
earthy
i
will
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
beer
it
seems
to
be
a
nice
transition
to
the
fall
for
me
although
i
would
prefer
a
slightly
darker
color
rjt
i
would
love
to
know
the
story
behind
both
the
beers
name
and
its
label
but
it
was
time
for
more
important
things
like
the
crack
i
love
a
brimful
can
and
when
this
one
revealed
itself
i
was
ready
to
go
i
initiated
an
inverted
glug
leading
to
a
nearrebellious
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
i
sat
back
as
the
battle
raged
sticky
lacing
appearing
in
the
wake
of
the
fighting
rebellion
should
not
be
without
casualties
the
first
rule
of
the

is
to
talk
about

thanks
to
the
brewery
for
providing
that
bit
of
411
nose
had
a
grassy
honeysweetness
that
really
put
me
more
in
mind
of
a
lager
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
although
i
was
still
getting
that
honey
flavor
it
was
accompanied
by
an
earthy
maltiness
and
an
intensely
grassy
hoppiness
ibu
42
holy
rebelliousness
i
can
drink
this
all
day
the
grassy
bitterness
was
offset
nicely
by
the
biscuit
maltiness
on
the
tongue
it
was
on
the
finish
that
it
really
came
together
though
it
was
like
summer
in
the
country
with
biscuits
and
honey
after
mowing
the
grass
i
really
am
a
fan
of
this
one
and
wish
that
it
were
more
widely
available
a
big
shout
out
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
bready
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
also
bready
some
caramel
sweetness
a
touch
of
hops
is
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
this
beer
was
tasty
and
enjoyable
if
need
be
ill
revise
the
review
serving
type
12
ounce
can
o
i
will
be
trying
the
rest
of
what
french
broad
has
to
offer
the
regular
ipa
was
twice
if
not
moreso
as
bitter
as
the
13
rebels
so
it
begs
the
question
what
has
french
broad
done
with
the
rest
of
their
brews
for
the
record
though
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
o
taste
is
not
bad
but
otherwise
unremarkable
from
notes
51313
o
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
and
i
think
this
is
fbs
best
beer
the
taste
was
sweet
malty
and
fruity
there
was
a
breadiness
to
this
bitter
but
a
bit
of
apple
plum
and
sweetness
that
really
caught
my
eye
not
a
bad
example
of
the
genre
but
perhaps
a
bit
to
bubbly
for
my
liking
o
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
flavor
and
a
low
abv
a
little
sweeter
than
other
offerings
in
the
style
but
definitely
one
to
try
or
have
again
overall
a
very
good
and
balanced
ale
o
overall
this
is
plenty
drinkable
tasty
and
interesting
though
i
dont
think
i
am
in
love
with
the
flavor
there
is
almost
a
light
licorice
character
to
it
that
seems
out
of
place
to
me
overall
its
a
very
solid
beer
plenty
of
flavor
good
balance
nothing
overpowering
fun
lacing
too
o
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
given
to
me
by
a
friend
from
asheville
a
random
pick
at
the
store
a
muchappreciated
effort
the
beer
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
citrus
with
some
orange
and
lemon
notes
there
is
also
a
strong
biscuit
malt
component
the
flavor
is
fairly
malt
heavy
with
both
biscuit
and
toffee
there
is
also
some
bitter
orange
character
and
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thin
mild
carbonation
smooth
in
the
mouth
a
pretty
solid
esb
o
a
decent
esb
to
try
though
not
very
complex
overall
not
bad
at
all
a
bit
heavier
body
would
make
it
nicer
but
again
not
bad
very
enjoyable
this
in
my
opinion
was
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
its
one
dimensional
and
that
one
dimension
was
burnt
toast
the
hops
were
noticeable
but
were
unable
to
tame
the
intense
malt
character
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
overall
an
ok
esb
o
kind
of
wish
it
was
a
little
bit
more
bold
but
definitely
a
tasty
super
drinkable
brew
o
13
rebels
esb
is
not
a
bad
effort
in
fact
it
displays
many
of
the
classic
traits
of
english
esbs
unfortunately
the
lack
of
head
retention
and
the
lack
of
a
heavier
hop
profile
are
not
forgivable
in
the
end
its
not
bad
but
not
great
either
o
pretty
decent
esb
but
not
spectacular
that
being
said
i
would
gladly
have
a
few
of
these
a
good
example
of
the
style
not
a
heavily
hopped
americanized
version
good
stuff
i
had
several
bombers
of
this
over
several
days
and
would
add
this
to
my
must
try
list
o
overall
this
is
a
style
that
has
been
growing
on
me
and
this
one
is
pretty
decent
and
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
into
the
style
mostly
malty
and
spicey
nothing
crazy
checking
through
other
reviews
my
overcarbonated
bottle
seems
to
be
an
anomaly
a
pretty
decent
esb
its
no
rye
hopper
but
not
too
shabby
this
beer
poured
copper
and
was
average
in
appearance
it
had
a
very
bitter
feeling
throughout
as
described
by
a
friend
also
drinking
this
brew
it
has
the
qualities
that
you
crave
in
an
ipaminus
the
sweetness
and
syrup
qualities
i
really
like
this
beer
as
a
session
choice
it
was
an
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
bitter
beer
that
provoked
continuous
sipping
it
is
a
great
beer
and
great
for
the
style
an
alright
esb
a
few
pronounced
flaws
hold
this
one
back
overall
a
decent
easy
drinking
esb
nothing
to
blow
you
away
but
it
hits
the
spot
a
few
of
these
can
be
consumed
in
a
session
i
may
not
be
getting
too
deep
into
details
but
this
tasted
really
good
a
hoppier
version
of
the
esb
great
color
great
taste
it
really
made
folding
the
laundry
doing
the
dishes
and
making
lunches
for
the
kids
go
smoothly
overall
i
would
say
that
you
will
enjoy
this
and
be
happy
its
the
golden
age
of
american
brewing
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
because
of
its
low
alcohol
content
the
sweetness
provides
for
an
interesting
taste
13
rebels
esb
is
pretty
solid
certainly
an
easy
sipper
the
reasonable
abv
is
appreciated
too
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
the
moderate
malt
sweetness
and
a
rather
big
hop
character
as
with
the
nose
the
hop
character
just
isnt
to
my
liking
moderately
soapy
intensely
earthy
almost
minerallike
this
is
very
very
green
bitterness
is
on
the
lower
side
of
medium
theres
an
almost
resiny
hop
character
here
grain
and
yeast
are
secondary
here
especially
the
latter
mediumlight
in
body
with
fairly
high
carbonation
this
finishes
with
plenty
of
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
decent
though
not
particularly
enjoyable

eventually
dissipates
into
a
cluster
of
foam
around
the
edges

the
glass
thick
slashes
of

were
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
suggests
toasted
light
malt
with
a
trace
of
fruit
taste
expresses
quite
a
but
of
grain
somewhat
close
to
a
sour
mash
flavor
but
not
quite
its
also
slightly
tart
with
perhaps
a
trace
of
caramel
malt
and
a
light
lingering
bitterness
between
quaffs
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
consistency
is
mediumlight
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
a
decent
esb
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
quite
respectable
nonetheless
overall
impression
really
like
the
malt
profile
but
really
would
love
to
see
an
injection
of
earthy
and
leafy
hop
goodness
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
e
s
b
drain
pour
after
a
few
sips
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
here
notes
well
definitely
leaning
british
heavily
but
it
seems
like
it
might
not
be
so
fresh
ah
well
decent
beer
but
not
great
had
this
one
on
cask
at
the
borough
during
raleigh
beer
week
dry
hopped
with
cluster
hops
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
very
murky
dark
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
a
nice
amount
of
floral
hops
with
sweet
malts
noticeable
as
well
the
taste
was
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
caramel
malts
earthy
mild
citrus
hops
and
a
dash
of
sweet
fruits
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
smooth
and
enjoyable
as
much
as
enjoy
a
good
hoppy
cask
ipa
like
the
2
hearted
cask
i
tried
the
other
day
this
is
what
cask
beer
is
truly
all
about
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
toasted
aspect
of
the
malt
needs
toned
down
to
allow
more
bitter
hoppiness
to
at
least
pull
even
in
the

very

in
this
brew
all
in
all
it
is
a
decent
beer
not
outstanding
but
decent
so
far
my
least
favorite
of
the
french
broad
beers
that
i
have
had
the
taste
is
very
watery
with
just
a
little
bitter
this
is
very
boring
overall
i
was
disappointed
i
thought
it
would
be
much
hoppier
honestly
it
tasted
a
lot
like
fat
tire
i
would
pass
on
drinking
this
again
unless
there
were
no
better
options
not
very
impressed
here
definitely
a
lot
of
flavors
happening
but
they
all
tend
to
clash
with
each
other
ive
had
any
number
of
better
esbs
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
the
first
time
was
a
few
years
ago
out
of
a
growler
and
this
time
its
out
of
a
bomber
pours
a
hazy
browncopper
thin
head
smells
faintly
like
sweet
malt
and
caramel
earthy
flavors
from
the
hops
are
very
prominent
with
a
warming
sweetness
and
mild
alcohol
fairly
malt
forward
and
really
on
target
for
the
style
i
think
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
other
breweries
overhop
their
bitters
which
doesnt
really
make
sense
to
me
this
ones
an
exception
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
beers
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color

a

the

has
malt
fruity
esters
and
some
hops
taste
has
upfront
malt
with
some
background
notes
of
banana
and
apple
the
backbone
of
this
beer
is
a
delicate
hop
flavor
that
is
not
overly
aggresive
the
mouth
is
nice
with
a
medium
level
of
carbination
a
good
and
very
drinkable
esb
d
moar
plox
very
enjoyable
e
s
b
hits
the
style
on
a
sweet
note
worth
sharing
d
very
high
can
be
paired
with
anything
and
consumed
all
day
and
night
very
very
good
beer
i
can
see
how
this
would
not
appeal
to
everyone
its
unique
quite
a
bit
off
the
beaten
path
ill
be
sad
to
see
this
glass
go
its
moving
off
at
quite
a
pace
nothing
horrible
but
nothing
outstanding
either
it
has
maybe
suffered
from
a
little
too
much
time
on
the
shelf
but
i
think
theres
more
to
it
than
that
worth
a
try
french
broad
brewing
is
a
credit
to
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
said
13
rebels
esb
is
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
and
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
a
second
time
coming
at
it
from
a
different
direction
most
craft
breweries
would
kill
to
have
a
worst
beer
thats
this
good
drinkability
a
worthy
attempt
at
the
style
and
an
okay
perfectly
drinkable
beer
personally
id
prefer
a
slightly
bigger
body
and
greater
inclusion
of
caramel
flavor
but
again
thats
just
me
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
but
not
very
persistent
light
tan
head
aroma
is
mainly
malty
with
a
good
hoppy
undertone
and
just
a
hint
of
apples
and
yeast
flavor
is
malty
with
a
good
bitter
undertone
not
complex
but
still
satisfactory
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
a
little
fizzy
not
too
shabby
actually
pretty
nice
no
over
powering
characteristic
to
turn
you
off
easy
drinking
fairly
simplistic
but
complex
enough
to
enjoy
imho
i
believe
this
would
be
an
enjoyable
session
beer
md
there
is
a
pretty
good
amount
of
bite
on
the
tongue
from
this
one
but
relatively
low
in
carbonation
which
confuses
me
overall
though
very
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
as
an
everyday
beer
good
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
pretty
good
esb
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
its
hoppier
than
a
traditional
esb
so
its
definitely
an
american
version
its
no
substitute
for
a
nice
fullers
but
at
only
4
a
bomber
its
a
nice
alternative
hmmm
well
this
is
definitely
an
american
style
esb
there
is
the
typical
nuttiness
and
dry
biscuity
malt
but
also
far
more
hoppiness
than
usual
for
the
style
that
being
said
it
works
here
unlike
ding
i
wont
be
hung
up
on
the
style
parameters
here
and
simply
enjoy
the
beer
for
what
it
is
pouurs
a
nice
coppery
color
but
the
head
fades
a
little
too
quickly
nice
slightly
nutty
aromas
with
some
of
that
biscuity
malt
and
some
earthyspicy
hops
the
taste
to
my
mind
nicely
balances
the
classic
esb
flavors
with
a
nice
and
surprising
jolt
of
hops
they
by
no
means
dominate
the
beer
but
merely
add
another
dimension
and
take
the
beer
into
a
more
indeterminate
style
good
carbonation
and
a
very
nice
drink
the
aroma
is
odd
for
the
style
it
is
grassy
and
paper
like
with
some
biscuits
fruit
and
yeast
the
appearance
is
deep
gold
with
an
amber
hue
and
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
and
astringent
the
palate
is
thin
overall
this
beer
has
some
good
qualities
but
the
negative
ones
bury
them
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
doesnt
go
very
far
off
of
the
path
of
a
traditional
esb
but
where
it
does
it
succeeds
this
is
a
decent
slightlyhoppedup
esb
that
i
quite
enjoyed
thanks
ding
d
with
the
low
abv
and
mild
flavor
i
could
put
away
several
at
a
sitting
nothing
amazing
with
respect
to
the
flavor
or
aroma
but
this
is
a
solid
esb
that
ill
likely
buy
again
pours
copperread
with
a
moderately
sized
head
the
bubbles
are
loose
and
fades
to
a
thin
head
quickly
there
is
some
decent
retention
and
lacing
but
it
looks
just
about
right
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
but
lacks
a
real
hop
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
earthiness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
a
floral
character
the
taste
is
nice
and
sweet
like
golden
raisins
a
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
but
not
overpowering
not
much
in
terms
of
buscuity
flavors
minimal
bitterness
with
an
earthy
spiciness
nice
and
balanced
without
a
hint
of
alcohol
no
estery
flavors
good
burst
of
carbonation

not
incredibly
full
very
easy

even
at

i
could
see
myself
going
through
quite
a
few
of
these
i
really
enjoyed
having
it
and
would
revisit
it
if
the
price
were
right
d
pretty
decent
though
not
great
esb
overall
it
was
decent
ok
maybe
but
nothing
i
would
really
go
after
again
anytime
soon
i
have
had
worse
though
and
much
better
as
well
if
i
am
being
honest
pretty
thin
on
the
body
too
thin
finishes
really
dry
as
well
extraordinarily
ordinary
nothing
special
here
not
a
terrific
beer
13

keeps
plugging

before
you

could
do
much
worse

if

remain

come

be

create

this
bomber
is
going
down
quicker
than
i
imagined
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
this
again
especially
if
i
found
it
ontap
maybe
a
fresh
one
from
the
tap
would
improve
the
smell
rating
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
underwhelming
it
does
get
tastier
after
a
few
bites
of
food
however
some
grainy
breaded
malts
and
a
mineral
note
reminiscent
of
sourdough
give
way
to
a
bit
of
sweet
fruity
esthers
from
the
yeast
that
add
pear

mango
finishes
very
dry

it
poured
a

it

of

i
think
that
this
was
due
in
part
to
the
mini
glasses
that
we
were
werving
them
in
however
the
head
did
hang
around
for
a
good
amount
of
time
this
was
the
first
esb
i
had
ever
tried
so
im
not
totally
sure
if
it
was
100
true
to
its
characteristics
overall
though
it
had
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
good
maltiness
to
it
with
very
sweet
overtones
not
much
on

did

still

i

my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
staples
at
the
federal
and
on
the
first
real
nice
weekend
in
durham
this
spring
i
couldnt
help
but
give
this
a
try
while
taking
in
the
good

out
on

it
poured
a
light
golden

with
no

to

it

however
leave
good

was
of
honey

possibly
some
hops

everything
was
very
muted

taste
was
extreme

bittering

honey
some

a
very
nice
esb
from
three
floyds
pleasantly
bitter
and
big
lots
of
malt
plenty
of
underlying
hops
a
nice
balance
is
struck
i
appreciate
that
the
traditional
malty
esb
backbone
is
still
in
the
forefront
when
it
comes
to
a
three
floyds
beer
perhaps
one
of
their
least
not
normal
beers
but
it
makes
this
a
success
o
lord
rear
admiral
is
hands
down
the
greatest
esb
in
the
world
it
combines
brewing
talent
and
creativity
in
a
bottle
and
provides
a
lovely
experience
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
the
english
esb
style
and
this
just
blows
it
wide
open
so
tasty
and
thick
i
was
excited
to
see
bottles
heading
my
way
so
i
hope
to
get
more
in
the
future
if
i
could
pick
a
beer
to
drink
every
day
with
any
meal
it
would
be
this
one
a
complex
yet
balanced
masterpiece
from
three
floyds
tasted
from
a
1
pt
12
oz
bottle
on
april
3
2015
alright
not
the
best
from
3
floyds
lord
horatio
nelson
after
whom
this
beer
takes
its
name
is
celebrated
as
one
of
britains
most
heroic
naval
figures
and
has
monuments
all
over
the
country
including
trafalgar
square
in
london
im
not
sure
what
the
munster
indiana
equivalent
would
be
the
parking
lot
of
the
hilton
off
the
brewerys
industrial
strip
but
this
lord
admiral
is
deserving
of
a
statue
too
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
bitterness
but
was
only
getting
light
hops
its
still
an
easy
drinker
with
a
clean
finish
great
beer
glad
i
tried
it
good
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
bitter
hit
but
not
a
full
blown
stone
beer
overall
a
nice
bitter
ale
that
goes
down
extremely
smooth
another
winner
for
fff
looking
forward
to
having
more
of
this
cant
go
wrong
with
an
8
bomber
of
this
if
you
like
a
nice
bitter
ale
overall
solid
but
i
dont
really
think
this
is
my
style
even
with
a
nice
citrusy
hop
profile
deep
golden
almost
amber
color
with
fluffy
white
head
that
delivers
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
drinking
experience
the
smell
jumps
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
cap
big
bright
hop
punch
that
has
some
fruitiness
and
bitterness
that
hits
hard
then
fades
away
this
beer
was
even
better
than
i
remember
it
from
last
year
hop
forward
like
many
3
floyds
but
there
is
balance
with
the
malt
an
esb
that
would
satisfy
hop
heads
for
sure
overall
although
i
like
the
esb
style
i
found
this
way
too
hoppy
and
bitter
compared
to
english
versions
like
fullers
i
wouldnt
have
expected
any
less
from
three
floyds
and
while
i
like
hops
as
much
as
the
next
guy
this
beer
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
pours
a
nice
copperburnt
orange
color
fluffy
slightly
off
white
head
good
retention
great
whiffs
of
bready
nutty
toasty
biscuity
caramely
malts
blend
whith
whiffs
of
orange
and
light
berry
taste
brings
above
notes
together
in
a
fantasticly
balanced
blend
wonderful
malt
base
with
fruity
notes
throughout
medium
bodied
a
touch
more
heft
would
be
welcome
fantastic
unique
flavorful
esb
o
a
solid
bitter
from
fff
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
but
brings
a
lot
of
flavor
worth
getting
a
bottle
if
you
are
near
when
they
have
it
out
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
copper
brown
offwhite
head
with
dense
creamy
retention
and
webbed
lace
nose
has
an
abundance
of
caramel
sweet
and
bready
a
good
dose
of
citrus
hops
but
some
earthier
and
spicier
notes
too
light
on
the
palate
citrusy
and
rindy
still
an
abundace
of
caramel
and
toasty
biscuit
medium
feel
quite
low
carb
this
is
very
drinkable
cask
treatment
would
be
awesome
o
very
flavorful
and
great
balance
this
is
my
first
beer
from
three
floyds
and
it
is
very
good
overall
decent
but
not
particularly
memorable
glad
that
i
tried
it
but
not
rushing
out
to
pick
itup
agin
tastes
like
an
ipa
past
its
prime
o
i
was
expecting
something
good
but
i
got
something
great
a
unique
esb
and
an
amazing
beer
all
around
thank
the
gods
i
took
that
trip
to
the
brew
pub
overall
not
being
the
biggest
esb
fan
no
no
not
esb
i
said
ipa
i
only
drink
hoppy
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
awesome
beer
o
winner
here
definitely
a
great
bitter
beer
that
is
not
over
the
top
by
any
means
as
fff
does
they
didi
a
greta
job
with
this
brew
giving
a
slight
american
twist
to
a
english
import
style
very
nice
job
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
head
the
scent
lives
up
to
its
name
as
it
has
a
strong
bitter
scent
of
hops
starts
off
with
a
refreshing
wet
taste
that
is
bready
and
malty
it
moves
into
a
crisp
bitter
finish
that
is
dry
and
complex
like
other
3
floyds
beers
that
i
have
had
this
one
is
blended
nicely
together
that
is
makes
it
hard
to
pick
out
individual
attributes
as
they
compliment
each
other
very
well
only
complaint
is
this
was
a
little
more
watery
then
i
was
expecting
but
the
dry
finish
makes
up
for
it
fresh
bottle
in
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
an
inch
thick
off
white
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
light
citrus
toffee
and
malt
flavor
is
excellent
a
nice
cutting
piney
hop
blends
with
a
smooth
malt
and
caramel
and
toffee
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
and
it
lingers
it
sort
of
makes
you
salivate
for
another
very
very
good
beer
o
delicious
and
a
bit
hard
to
place
fruity
and
malty
goodness
o
a
very
tasty
wellbalanced
esb
with
a
fff
twist
one
of
several
brews
that
proves
that
fff
is
a
very
solid
brewery
adept
at
creating
exceptional
brews
in
a
variety
of
styles
overall
i
just
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
this
brew
i
think
it
has
great
characteristics
all
around
with
nice
balance
included
o
another
good
well
made
beer
from
3
floyds
that
paired
quite
nicely
with
homemade
carnitas
tacos
o
my
first
esb
and
i
am
a
fan
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
hops
would
be
a
tough
one
to
have
more
than
a
bottle
of
in
one
sitting
especially
considering
this
bottle
is
bomber
size
because
of
the
upfront
bittertarttangy
element
but
damn
its
a
good
one
and
surely
one
of
three
floyds
more
interesting
and
nonconformist
brews
for
sure
a
good
beer
something
different
than
i
am
used
to
from
fff
thanks
to
a
buddy
for
sharing
this
with
me
pours
a
hazy
reddish
orange
into
a
snifter
glass
has
a
mellow
citrusfloral
taste
up
front
with
a
bready
malt
background
at
the
finish
could
be
insanely
sessionable
as
its
so
easy
to
drink
interesting
american
take
on
a
esb
love
how
hazy
3fs
beers
are
overall
admiral
lord
nelson
is
an
excellent
north
american
interpretation
of
an
extra
special
bitter
it
combines
many
standard
esb
qualities
with
an
overthetop
hoppiness
and
insanely
robust
aromas
a
complete
joy
to
drink
i
would
recommend
this
to
hop
heads
and
english
ale
lovers
alike
o
a
pretty
good
offering
from
the
three
floyds
lineup
this
one
has
the
characteristic
three
floyds
hop
touch
but
is
still
utterly
drinkable
and
reasonably
faithful
to
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
expensive
for
what
it
is
i
still
happily
gulp
this
stuff
down
o
a
solid
hoppy
bitter
clean
and
easy
drinking
with
a
solid
malty
base
id
definitely
buy
more
of
this
for
springfall
if
it
was
locally
available
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
will
definitely
be
picking
myself
up
some
next
time
i
can
make
it
to
3f
o
a
really
good
ipa
a
really
off
esb
but
damn
good
nonetheless
heavy
side
of
light
bodied
lively
carbonation
one
of
the
better
american
versions
ive
had
of
this
style
falls
right
into
3fs
wheelhouse
drinkability
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
bitter
malt
bombs
definitely
the
most
impressive
offering
from
fff
for
me
because
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
definitely
the
best
esb
ive
had
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
if
youre
looking
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
good
esb
even
if
it
is
a
bit
americanized
we
are
seeing
exactly
what
the
brits
had
intended
with
this
beer
something
on
the
left
side
of
malty
and
smooth
with
excellent
ale
characteristics
like
fruitiness
from
the
esters
and
a
bitterness
that
pushes
back
great
american
craft
beer
would
completely
recommend
this
beer
drink
it
was
a
tasty
esb
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
an
esb
and
this
was
pretty
money
on
flavor
and
balance
ive
liked
a
lot
of
the
three
floyds
stuff
i
have
had
this
was
a
nice
simple
clean
beer
for
me
o
not
a
style
i
drink
a
lot
of
but
this
one
is
fantastic
a
hopped
up
esb
another
job
well
done
by
three
floyds
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
drink
all
the
time
lord
admiral
nelson
pours
a
roasted
chestnut
color
a
bit
dark
for
the
style
and
lightens
to
amber
when
heldo
to
light
the
off
white
foam
that
caps
the
beer
approaches
three
fingers
in
height
has
displays
decent
retention
and
is
nice
and
sticky
the
nose
has
some
crisp
biscuity
and
caramel
malty
notes
as
well
as
some
herbal
hop
notes
a
light
citric
aroma
enters
the
picture
as
well
and
serves
as
a
nice
accent
rather
than
taking
over
the
whole
beer
the
nose
serves
as
a
pretty
good
preview
of
whats
to
come
the
bready
and
caramel
sweetness
lead
things
off
before
a
modest
bitterness
lets
itself
be
known
mid
palate
the
balance
is
superb
i
couldnt
describe
this
beer
as
either
overtly
hoppy
or
malty
the
same
predominantly
noble
herbal
hop
with
a
light
touch
of
american
citrus
blend
is
on
display
at
the
back
end
of
each
sip
props
the
3
floyds
for
showing
restraint
and
keeping
this
one
essentially
british
with
just
enough
american
influence
to
liven
things
up
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
overall
the
body
is
sturdy
relatively
full
for
the
abv
and
the
carbonation
is
slightly
understated
a
great
spin
on
a
classic
style
o
if
one
of
the
criteria
for
this
style
is
balance
this
is
right
on
hops
arent
overbearing
malt
isnt
overbearing
they
just
come
together
to
make
a
tasty
medium
bodied
beer
little
heavy
for
me
on
a
summer
release
but
the
taste
helped
me
get
past
that
o
overall
a
very
solid
offering
for
an
esb
can
certainly
hang
with
the
best
of
them
when
it
comes
to
esbs
overall
a
decent
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
but
didnt
dissapoint
only
thing
i
dont
care
much
for
is
the
floral
hop
notes
in
the
flavor
a
pretty
solid
beer
though
easy
to
drink
my
onyl
drawback
was
i
wanted
it
to
be
even
more
bitter
than
it
was
o
this
is
a
good
beer
however
it
used
to
be
better
i
swear
this
thing
is
darker
and
not
as
dry
this
year
than
in
years
past
in
fact
this
beer
is
incredibly
similar
to
alpha
king
this
year
im
going
to
drink
and
ak
after
this
for
comparison
go
back
to
the
old
way
fff
neighbor
brougth
home
a
growler
of
sir
lord
admiral
nelson
from
three
floyds
it
was
about
a
day
and
ahlf
old
the
appearance
was
nice
great
head
and
a
caramel
clear
color
the
nose
offered
hop
alcohol
and
some
malt
the
taste
was
very
sweet
to
me
definitely
bitter
and
some
hops
the
bitterness
really
affected
the
mouthfeel
score
for
me
at
least
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
3fs
other
offerings
o
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
somehow
missed
last
year
despite
looking
for
it
overall
another
nice
offering
from
fff
would
i
consider
it
100
esb
maybe
not
but
it
definitely
more
english
than
the
blackheart
english
ipa
both
are
great
beers
that
i
have
no
reservations
about
drinking
again
i
bought
a
few
bombers
of
lan
to
being
home
o
pretty
good
beer
esbs
are
a
style
i
enjoy
when
theres
a
good
one
and
id
consider
this
a
good
one
will
definitely
drink
when
available
medium
body
with
some
hop
resins
present
on
the
palate
extremely
drinkable
another
great
one
in
fffs
awesome
line
of
hoppy
beers
i
would
not
have
guessed
the
6
5
abv
none
detected
at
all
poured
from
bomber
no
date
stamp
on
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
glass
pours
a
nice
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
small
and
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
of
hops
grapefruit
citrus
sweet
bready
and
caramel
malts
and
some
toffee
flavor
is
nice
picking
up
juicy
hops
with
flavors
of
citrus
white
grapes
grapefruit
herbs
with
a
tealike
taste
sweet
candy
type
maltiness
caramel
and
toffee
bready
and
biscuity
malts
the
body
is
medium
with
a
nice
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
good
esb
with
an
american
twist
to
it
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
overall
decent
beer
with
an
enjoyable
flavor
profile
but
the
look
was
just
too
average
and
the
palate
was
worth
forgetting
the
taste
didnt
really
match
the
nose
either
it
was
actually
a
halfdecent
dark
ipa
but
not
really
good
representation
of
an
english
esb
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
dont
need
it
again
thanks
again
thomashardy
atmosphere
very
nice
great
color
and
a
giant
head
with
some
great
lacing
nose
is
not
complex
but
has
an
interesting
river
water
or
seawater
character
thats
tough
to
place
but
makes
it
quite
unique
bitter
character
but
a
nice
slightly
sweet
balancing
act
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
d
this
is
a
typical
fff
hopfest
whereby
they
take
a
style
and
hop
the
shit
out
of
it
to
create
an
awesome
beer
yeah
thats
not
to
say
that
the
beer
itself
is
typical
quite
the
contrary
its
also
not
just
a
hop
bomb
as
there
is
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
that
is
typical
of
the
esb
style
you
could
call
it
an
eesb
i
guess
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
heavy
in
the
front
and
thin
at
the
back
there
is
a
lot
of
piny
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
with
only
a
minimal
sweetness
up
front
the
hop
flavors
fill
out
the
midpalate
so
thoroughly
the
beer
falls
flat
on
the
finish
pretty
good
drinking
beer
very
enjoyable
bitterness
is
minimal
but
thats
ok
for
the
style
id
have
it
again
the
more
i
drink
the
more
resiny
the
beer
gets
but
thats
from
the
high
hop
presence
it
is
good
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
smooth
feel
and
light
level
of
carbonation
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
46
d
a
very
under
the
radar
offering
from
fffs
and
i
dont
know
why
to
me
its
a
very
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
brew
its
probably
the
most
ipaish
esb
on
the
planet
and
it
totally
works
because
of
balance
theres
a
very
pleasant
flavor
that
runs
through
the
brew
that
gives
it
a
great
personality
the
malts
and
hop
flavors
work
perfectly
together
hard
to
find
but
woth
the
hunt
pours
deep
orange
w
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
clover
honey
sharp
minerals
autumn
leaves
the
taste
is
clean
mineral
water
herbal
honey
tangelo
tang
orange
skin
bitter
finish
its
highly
carbonated
midweight
body
really
too
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
this
big
well
done
d
high
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
be
perfectly
happy
id
return
to
this
beer
gladly
at
any
time
d
very
good
clean
and
refreshing
quite
poundable
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sure
average
mouthfeel
and
decent
drinkability
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
would
probably
only
try
it
again
if
i
could
do
so
on
tap
though
got
this
as
an
awesome
extra
in
a
trade
recently
with
a
very
generous
midwest
ba
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
big
frothy
looking
white
head
that
shrinks
down
to
soapy
lacing
im
not
really
loving
the
smell
on
this
sweet
malts
are
really
front
runners
on
this
i
get
a
kind
of
apple
sauce
smell
but
it
seems
really
out
of
place
behind
all
that
is
a
slight
smell
of
piney
hops
id
really
love
a
bit
more
of
a
hoppy
smell
big
malts
on
this
with
a
decent
bittering
finish
of
floral
piney
hops
its
pretty
nice
drinking
but
i
overall
am
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
one
right
now
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
would
imagine
but
the
carbonation
is
nice
overall
this
beer
drinks
fair
enough
but
im
not
in
love
with
it
i
poured
this
one
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
it
poured
a
watery
light
amber
very
translucent
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
floral
hops
bitterness
and
light
dry
sweetness
the
taste
is
good
but
its
not
mind
blowing
by
any
means
i
remember
this
being
better
last
year
it
drinks
very
thin
and
isnt
as
crisp
as
id
like
it
to
be
its
very
drinkable
because
its
a
very
solid
beer
but
this
bottle
at
least
disappointed
me
a
little
bit
its
good
but
nothing
too
crazy
overall
a
great
esb
it
doesnt
hurt
im
having
it
extremely
fresh
as
well
not
too
sweet
a
perfect
balance
of
hopssweet
malts
the
first
time
i
reviewed
this
i
wasnt
much
of
a
hophead
i
preferred
stouts
and
that
was
about
it
my
palate
has
definitely
changed
and
for
the
better
d
a
very
good
beer
lots
of
citrus
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
one
again
another
great
3f
that
should
be
sought
out
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
even
if
on
the
high
end
abvwise
but
brings
a
lot
of
english
character
with
the
ingredients
used
love
this
beer
da
very
delicious
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
beer
that
i
could
take
down
all
the
time
no
problem
especially
with
the
decent
price
tag
and
abv
another
great
brew
from
fff
as
usual
just
a
lot
of
pleasant
hop
action
that
is
very
balanced
at
the
same
time
highly
recommended
drinkability
there
is
a
lot
of
overlap
in
flavor
profile
between
lord
admiral
nelson
and
alpha
king
nelson
shares
the
big
hop
profile
of
alpha
king
but
with
more
subdued
caramel
malt
sweetness
not
a
perfectly
dry
esb
but
still
quite
quenching
love
it
overall
this
is
another
extremely
fine
offering
from
three
floyds
if
this
became
the
mold
for
an
american
esb
i
would
not
complain
i
am
very
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
drinkability
great
d
a
very
good
brew
from
fff
why
am
i
not
shocked
d
goes
down
easily
somewhat
filling
mild
kick
this
is
one
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
a
medium
amber
color
is
poured
in
the
glass
with
a
light
beige
colored
head
that
is
about
a
half
inch
high
the
laces
slowly
down
the
glass
and
settles
to
a
thin
layer
citrus
and
grass
right
into
the
nose
at
every
scent
then
gradually
fading
away
slowly
a
cracked
grain
and
breadyyeasty
flavor
attacks
the
palate
come
to
the
front
but
is
soon
overtaken
by
the
hops
the
hops
bring
a
strong
grapefruit
flavor
that
attacks
the
palate
that
is
followed
up
by
a
piney
resin
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palate
a
watery
thin
texture
at
the
front
then
gradually
gaining
weight
and
becoming
more
medium
bodied
staying
that
way
till
the
finish
a
strong
bitter
how
about
an
extreme
bitter
this
one
crosses
over
into
the
ipa
realm
everything
is
very
good
about
this
beer
though
an
inviting
look
and
a
fragrant
aroma
invites
one
to
the
glass
the
taste
just
backs
up
those
aspects
with
strong
hop
flavor
and
intensity
the
feel
stays
consistent
all
the
way
through
so
hop
heads
drink
up
d
very
good
and
drinkable
esb
from
fff
and
will
definitely
seek
out
another
bottle
another
good
fff
brew
that
im
really
happy
i
got
to
try
i
would
have
loved
to
sample
this
fresh
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
hope
fff
decides
to
brew
this
again
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
esb
and
another
great
beer
from
three
floyds
if
you
see
this
beer
grab
a
bottle
or
two
and
enjoy
recommended
hey
nick
floyd
if
you
are
reading
this
make
more
of
this
gem
and
make
it
often
seasonal
springtime
six
packs
of
this
stuff
would
be
fantastic
oh
and
since
i
have
your
ear
distribute
to
ohio
again
that
is
all
d
this
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
6
5
is
wellhidden
and
the
texture
and
flavors
are
conducive
to
multiple
pours
wish
id
found
this
when
it
was
fresher
i
tried
it
ontap
and
the
hops
really
popped
back
then
look
for
a
rereview
next
time
this
is
bottled
d
low
enough
abv
and
not
too
overbearing
would
session
cheers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
an
esb
per
se
but
taken
in
context
with
the
3f
pantheon
it
fits
right
in
all
the
malt
character
of
an
esb
with
some
american
hopping
d
this
was
a
pretty
easy
drinker
polished
off
the
bomber
no
problem
i
probably
wont
look
to
have
it
again
though
just
more
hoppy
than
i
like
in
an
esb
mediumbodied
with
good
effervescence
slightly
warming
and
smoother
than
expected
though
i
dont
know
why
i
thought
that
a
decent
tasting
brew
though
it
needs
more
body
to
it
d
phenominal
not
much
more
i
can
say
about
that
thanks
cheezdawg
drinkability
is
super
high
no
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
taste
of
this
wellbalanced
and
fullflavored
beer
it
was
odd
to
me
that
an
esb
had
such
citrusy
hops
but
it
is
an
american
esb
just
like
apas
differ
from
epas
d
an
allaround
good
drinker
md
not
as
rough
on
the
palate
as
appearance
shows
medium
body
and
a
slight
dry
finish
not
as
dry
as
expected
with
the
gratuitous
amount
of
hops
super
drinkable
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
was
excited
to
see
it
at
the
tasting
the
beer
pours
an
orange
iced
tea
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
resiny
hops
very
impressive
for
a
beer
of
this
style
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
along
with
the
same
resiny
hops
from
the
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
poured
a
clear
copper
with
a
little
tan
head
it
smelled
like
apricot
and
papaya
and
candied
grapefruit
with
some
light
caramel
and
orange
it
tasted
like
orange
and
apricot
with
some
grapefruit
and
papaya
and
honey
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
unlike
any
other
esb
ive
had
but
it
was
certainly
both
extra
special
and
bitter
it
was
also
very
sweet
and
hoppy
and
clean
this
is
what
english
ipas
should
be
rather
than
the
boring
earthy
underhopped
drinks
they
tend
to
be
great
beer
drinkability
no
alcohol
burn
great
hop
flavor
nice
citrusy
zest
very
easy
to
drink
i
hope
i
can
obtain
this
one
again
poured
clear
copper
color
with
an
average
frothy
offwhite
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
moderate
earthy
hop
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
spicy
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
solid
drinkable
beer
d
this
is
not
always
my
favorite
style
but
three
floyds
has
done
well
here
a
nice
hop
component
which
allows
a
bit
of
malt
to
come
through
but
not
all
that
much
in
terms
of
sweetness
an
ambercopper
colour
with
small
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
really
strong
here
some
piney
hops
and
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
like
a
classic
bitter
just
hopped
up
with
the
american
style
hops
i
had
split
this
bottle
and
wish
i
could
have
drank
more
i
really
enjoy
this
jons
bottle
the
aroma
is
he
first
to
hit
amarillo
orange
like
and
then
some
odd
acidity
beautiful
head
on
cloudy
orange
a
creamy
taste
it
is
a
nice
orange
tangerine
ipa
bitterness
unique
although
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
lacey
nice
orange
aftertaste
d
overall
is
a
very
good
beer
however
is
a
little
hoppier
than
i
typically
expect
in
an
esb
its
not
bad
just
a
general
observation
extremely
drinkable
another
great
one
in
fffs
awesome
line
of
hoppy
beers
what
an
amazing
american
style
english
bitter
respects
the
style
yet
adds
a
nice
twist
to
it
a
great
session
beer
what
the
abv
is
6
5
oh
really
well
this
is
a
great
session
beer
still
a
real
soft
yeasty
start
on
the
lips
i
love
that
feeling
carbonation
gases
exposing
the
creamy
body
right
off
the
bat
just
beyond
its
a
cool
sweep
of
breadishly
sweet
malts
keeping
things
moving
on
an
even
keel
the
taste
sharpens
becoming
distinctly
cu
metallic
a
soft
floral
note
takes
hold
right
as
the
beer
peaks
the
sharp
copper
and
the
softly
bitter
hop
dance
wonderfully
towards
my
throat
a
charge
of
citric
sweet
lemon
spreads
quickly
becoming
earthy
and
bitter
buttery
and
then
more
pointedly
bitter
in
the
finish
puckering
now
with
some
high
notes
sticking
around
the
top
of
my
mouth
a
fun
beer
to
swirl
around
those
full
buttery
notes
take
their
toll
nearing
the
end
of
the
bomber
my
lips
are
sticky
along
with
my
throat
no
denying
though
that
this
beer
is
fun
as
it
looks
pours
with
a
light
fluffy
head
just
a
bit
of
lace
as
the
head
falls
near
crystal
clear
light
gold
in
color
with
plenty
of
fizz
smells
wonderful
lots
of
tropical
fruits
mango
papaya
pineapple
etc
whoa
remarkably
thin
and
exceptionally
drier
than
i
anticipated
lots
of
tropical
fruit
flavors
up
front
some
malt
and
then
i
dunno
it
just
sort
of
evaporates
extremely
drinkable
at
first
until
i
get
a
nasty
bit
of
hot
alcohol
fusels
in
the
aftertaste
which
fortunately
dissipates
rather
quickly
this
could
be
called
alpha
king
light
world
class
d
a
good
esb
with
a
good
maltiness
that
smoothes
out
some
of
the
harshness
the
massive
hops
might
impart
definitely
an
easy
drinker
the
22oz
bottle
didnt
last
lont
i
dont
know
why
but
when
my
buddy
always
recommends
a
beer
from
fff
i
always
hesitate
just
a
bit
finally
he
gets
tired
of
me
doubting
and
we
end
up
splitting
a
bomber
i
have
finally
stopped
doubting
the
fff
because
this
beer
is
awesome
i
like
esbs
and
their
harsh
bitter
finishes
and
this
one
is
not
a
let
down
pours
a
copper
reddish
orange
with
a
decent
2
finger
head
it
start
out
with
a
nice
caramel
malty
sweetness
then
transitions
to
an
intense
tart
then
it
takes
you
back
down
the
mountain
and
finishes
with
a
long
long
harsh
bitter
ending
everything
one
could
want
in
an
esb
i
bow
to
you
fff
admiral
lord
nelson
strong
bitter
is
yet
another
winner
from
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
the
hops
hit
hard
but
theres
also
a
more
than
solid
brew
supporting
them
if
you
like
your
esbs
to
be
extra
special
and
extra
bitter
seek
this
one
out
awesome
label
art
as
always
drinkability
is
good
and
would
be
even
better
if
they
put
it
in
6packs
a
little
thin
and
bubbly
in
the
mouth
this
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
d
the
lower
abv
on
this
makes
it
a
easy
drinker
in
fact
i
cracked
open
another
one
after
i
was
done
with
this
one
good
work
like
usual
three
floyds
if
you
have
the
chance
to
snag
this
one
do
it
you
wont
regret
it
at
all
drinkability
is
goodthe
bitterness
is
well
balanced
with
the
malty
finish
and
the
floral
hints
complement
the
bitterness
nicely
i
could
drink
this
all
night
nicely
balanced
for
a
floyds
beer
no
real
malt
character
just
a
breadiness
same
nectarine
notes
with
some
floral
aspects
as
well
nothing
id
seek
out
but
definitely
glad
i
tried
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
if
i
could
the
sweet
citrus
flavor
of
hops
was
very
nice
and
worked
well
with
the
bitter
finish
overall
one
of
the
best
esb
i
have
ever
had
seriously
this
is
nuts
and
everyone
needs
to
try
this
drinkability
22oz
of
this
nectar
and
im
yearning
for
more
id
like
to
see
3f
try
doing
a
regular
bitterif
they
havent
already
done
so
id
bet
london
to
a
brick
on
that
it
would
be
another
thing
of
beauty
d
not
really
true
to
style
but
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
3f
esb
i
know
fff
is
all
about
doing
things
a
little
different
and
for
me
this
beer
expands
my
concept
of
this
style
definitely
strong
on
hops
but
with
considerable
sensitivity
to
some
of
the
other
character
of
the
beer
it
varies
between
fullon
strength
and
finely
subtle
nuance
quite
worth
the
try
in
my
opinion
this
is
nothing
far
from
a
amazingly
crafted
work
of
art
easily
up
there
with
the
dreadnaughts
and
behemoths
an
immediate
favorite
pours
clear
and
a
dark
copper
color
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
with
an
off
white
color
and
emits
a
big
and
bold
citrus
and
floral
hop
aroma
a
preview
of
another
deliciously
hoppy
brew
from
fff
the
taste
is
sweet
and
hoppy
a
touch
tart
and
harsh
bitterness
alongside
the
mild
body
and
high
carbonation
make
this
brew
dance
on
the
palate
and
explode
with
sweet
hoppy
flavor
the
finish
is
also
tart
and
bitter
but
it
fades
slowly
and
gently
great
session
strength
and
flavor
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
its
definitely
a
bitter
but
not
overly
bitter
to
where
you
cant
enjoy
the
beer
the
beer
had
a
nice
aroma
surrounding
it
after
the
pour
and
it
produced
very
little
head
the
finish
was
clean
and
not
overpowering
a
great
beer
by
three
floyds
this
might
be
the
easiest
beer
from
three
floyds
to
drink
yes
i
enjoy
the
giant
hop
bombs
and
the
9
abv
beers
but
this
is
a
hit
at
only
6
percent
this
is
a
session
beer
for
me
i
hope
this
is
a
year
long
product
and
not
just
a
seasonal
i
will
say
that
my
point
of
view
is
a
little
skewed
because
i
only
paid
3
99
for
the
bomber
i
dont
know
if
the
price
was
wrong
or
that3floyds
is
trying
to
market
this
new
beer
but
at
3
99
i
will
make
this
a
regular
in
my
rotation
if
not
the
only
beer
i
drink
im
rereviewing
this
beer
just
had
this
yesterday
at
three
floyds
on
tap
its
quite
different
from
what
i
remember
pours
a
nice
hazy
orangegold
with
good
lacing
taste
is
much
more
mild
than
i
remember
very
pleasant
and
balanced
with
great
malt
character
bitter
but
not
what
i
would
call
hoppy
in
a
big
way
the
yeast
is
awesome
in
this
beer
very
biscuity
it
really
stays
with
you
this
is
a
great
representation
of
an
esb
enough
to
convince
me
to
brew
one
of
these
after
my
belgian
trappist
completes
primary
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
nice
creamy
head
although
not
as
much
as
is
normal
for
the
style
the
nose
is
definitely
dominated
by
some
great
citrus
hops
atop
semisweet
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
an
ipa
but
with
a
decidedly
english
influence
though
still
different
from
an
english
ipa
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
the
drinkability
on
this
was
excellent
and
im
really
looking
forward
to
being
able
to
try
the
bottled
edition
pours
a
nice
maple
syrup
brown
with
two
inches
of
sandy
head
great
lacing
and
retention
smell
is
largely
grapefruit
big
hops
though
there
is
something
thats
a
bit
off
and
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
taste
here
is
great
big
piney
hops
a
bit
of
weedy
hops
finished
with
some
biscuitybready
malta
hoppedup
esb
great
stuff
here
i
guess
this
review
is
to
style
because
as
a
beer
overall
i
would
call
this
an
a
but
as
an
esb
this
is
definitely
an
a
mf
is
medium
coating
creamy
maybe
a
tad
overcarbonated
very
drinkable
a
great
session
brew
if
i
had
it
in
me
i
could
easily
have
three
bombers
of
this
i
do
not
but
thats
the
kind
of
drinkability
this
thing
has
this
was
great
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
night
i
hope
they
end
up
bottling
this
d
easy
to
drink
and
an
awesome
brew
i
drink
this
one
every
time
im
in
the
brewpub
and
never
get
tired
of
it
dvery
well
balanced
favoring
the
hops
make
this
a
super
tasty
beer
that
is
backed
by
a
great
mouthfeel
attention
three
floyds
are
you
listening
you
must
make
as
a
hand
pulled
cask
ale
version
of
this
d
very
good
id
order
another
and
buy
a
sixer
i
tried
to
buy
a
growler
but
the
batch
was
too
small
to
allow
that
they
said
bottles
are
coming
out
in
january
apparently
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
and
slight
with
a
good
strong
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
i
understand
that
this
one
will
be
bottle
bound
soon
unique
product
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
once
this
controversial
potentially
notorious
british
maritime
hero
is
preserved
forever
as
another
3floydian
caricature
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
breaks
all
of
the
rules
this
was
just
right

this
beer
was
a
really
good
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
liked
the
cream
color
and
the
fluffy
amber
color
head
that
it
has
i
enjoyed
the
pine
citrus
hops
smell
that
it
had
it
had
a
dry
finish
with
this
beer
i
could
taste
the
pine
citrus
floral
earthy
hops
that
it
has
it
also
had
a
caramel
sweetness
to
it
that
i
liked
a
lot
as
well
overall
great
job
sweetwater
overall
very
well
done
esb
great
way
to
represent
a
style
quite
bitter
hoppy
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
malts
pine
grass
w
grapefruit
flavors
the
usual
good
quality
from
sweetwater
this
would
be
a
decent
occasional
brew
when
a
better
selection
is
not
available
overall
a
very
nice
beer
from
sweetwater
really
fits
the
fall
season
and
a
nice
alternative
to
pumpkin
brews
and
oktoberfests
the
feel
is
a
bit
bubbly
but
smooth
nicely
crisp
but
a
touch
light
the
motor
boat
love
motor
boating
is
a
great
beer
it
poured
a
rich
clear
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lace
the
scent
is
fresh
bitter
hop
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
not
sure
if
its
of
caramel
or
citrus
nature
perhaps
a
combo
of
both
the
taste
starts
and
finishes
with
a
very
nice
sweetness
the
middle
is
a
punch
of
bitterness
that
is
lovely
there
is
a
presence
of
caramel
biscuit
and
pine
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
really
like
this
one
its
bitter
yet
sweet
much
like
my
wife
rjt
o
i
thought
this
was
quite
enjoyable
nothing
crazy
or
outstanding
here
but
a
solid
esb
to
grab
off
the
shelf
i
style
i
dont
revisit
enough
overall
havent
really
had
too
many
esbs
but
this
one
is
okay
not
something
id
want
a
6
pack
of
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
esbs
o
i
enjoy
this
more
than
any
other
esb
ive
ever
had
but
i
think
thats
due
to
the
overly
hoppy
take
on
the
style
although
the
word
bitter
is
part
of
the
acronym
esbs
are
generally
not
this
bitter
this
is
more
of
a
dark
pale
ale
if
that
makes
any
sense
imo
but
regardless
of
what
sweetwater
wants
to
call
it
its
very
good
i
admit
when
i
bought
this
variety
12pack
the
esb
was
what
i
was
desiring
the
least
but
now
i
know
im
thoroughly
enjoying
every
beer
in
the
box
o
an
okay
beer
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
the
flavor
is
fine
but
just
leaves
me
looking
for
a
little
more
substance

this
offering
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
nose
is
primarily
citrus
especially
oranges
with
some
pine
and
resin
there
too
taste
delivers
the
bitterness
upfront
and
the
sweetness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
with
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
a
pretty
decent
beer
o
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
pairs
well
with
many
different
foods
while
it
has
an
american
twist
with
the
use
of
the
pine
and
citrus
hops
this
still
keeps
a
somewhat
authentic
british
feel
to
it
definitely
worth
trying
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
a
style
i
dont
think
is
done
enough
an
easy
drinking
esb
is
the
cure
for
whatever
ales
ya
this
baby
is
the
cure
thats
for
sure
makes
me
wanna
go
motor
boat
o
overall
a
nice
wellbalanced
fall
beer
always
look
forward
to
this
one
had
while
out
and
about
at
my
buddys
bachelor
party
tick
all
day
every
day
served
from
tap
into
a
samuel
adams
sampler
shaker
poured
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
spice
earth
earth
hop
spicy
hop
and
bread
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
spice
earth
spicy
hop
earth
hop
bread
and
floral
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
quite
surprised
that
i
have
not
reviewed
this
one
yet
there
was
a
really
nice
few
things
going
on
in
the
flavor
of
this
one
with
the
bread
and
floral
hop
notes
that
kept
my
palate
looking
for
what
was
going
to
happen
next
this
fact
definitely
made
it
rather
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
throughout
definitely
worth
your
time
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
very
well
balanced
smooth
but
refreshing
not
over
the
top
with
hops
mild
acidic
aftertaste
is
only
drawback
o
very
hoppy
for
an
esb
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
definitely
get
it
on
tap
again
o
a
stellar
session
brew
the
flavor
profile
is
simple
and
clean
but
well
defined
and
delicious
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
mug
initially
produced
a
good
3
finger
light
tan
colored
head
that
slowly
dissipated
to
1
finger
head
and
left
plenty
of
lacing
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
that
is
not
quite
clear
and
somewhat
cloudy
there
was
slight
carbonation
and
fine
bubbles
the
taste
is
a
definitive
esb
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
i
my
opinon
not
as
good
as
the
red
hook
esb
but
still
a
good
esb
worth
another
try
o
great
offering
here
from
sweetwater
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
o
unfortunately
the
outstanding
appearance
only
led
to
a
decent
beer
not
bad
but
not
memorable
either
d
decent
drinking
but
not
exactly
what
i
think
of
for
the
style
seems
more
like
a
pale
ale
to
me
georgeous
copper
colored
beer
with
a
massive
lasting
lightly
tanned
colored
head
subtle
aromas
of
caramel
biscuit
herbal
and
just
a
touch
of
grass
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
in
its
subtleness
but
is
a
bit
more
complex
caramel
and
sweet
with
just
enough
spicy
herbal
hops
to
make
it
interesting
light
mouthfeel
yet
crisp
and
slick
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
and
an
easy
drinker
i
wish
i
had
more
overall
impression
first
of
all
what
style
is
this
the
sweetness
is
way
to
strong
and
way
to
overpowering
needed
to
be
more
balanced
with
hop
i
probably
wont
be
even
giving
this
one
another
chance
and
not
sure
if
you
should
either
sorry
curtis
but
this
one
wasnt
my
favorite
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
sweetwater
beers
that
ive
had
to
date
well
balanced
and
tasty
from
start
to
finish
not
overly
bitter
at
all
and
possibly
a
bit
out
of
style
but
really
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
id
love
to
get
more
of
o
over
all
a
pretty
solid
esb
here
wouldnt
mind
visiting
this
one
again
probably
not
as
bitter
as
the
style
would
suggest
but
it
nice
just
to
have
a
well
crafted
balanced
ale
i
am
happy
i
picked
this
brew
up
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
the
nose
gives
a
piney
hop
profile
as
to
flavor
it
really
is
an
esb
as
the
label
suggests
but
with
the
hop
character
of
an
american
ipa
it
has
a
medium
body
that
originally
covers
the
tongue
with
malt
sweetness
before
changing
to
a
bitter
and
dry
hop
finish
the
bitterness
lingers
nicely
for
quite
a
while
very
drinkable
doesnt
explode
with
flavor
but
a
decent
option
when
i
am
looking
for
something
sessionable
and
malty
thats
not
a
malt
bomb
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
well
crafted
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
citrus
notes
in
this
one
more
hops
than
i
expected
from
an
esb
i
would
have
another
o
good
beer
recommended
drinkable
despite
the
bitterness
refreshing
interesting
combo
of
leafy
bittering
hops
and
rich
malty
flavors
very
drinkable
goes
down
almost
too
easy
toffee
is
practically
burnt
in
its
lingering
toastiness
interesting
take
on
a
summer
seasonal
certainly
not
floating
the
mainstream
its
tasty
but
different
than
most
esbs
kinda
like
an
esb
meets
a
marzen
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
sixer
of
this
each
year
but
certainly
no
more
than
that
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
other
esbs
and
other
fall
offerings
alright
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
personally
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
if
offered
o
nice
straightforward
bitter
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
this
is
an
easygoing
everyday
beer
for
me
o
a
fairly
good
esb
nothing
outstanding
but
good
for
the
price
o
dudes
are
right
round
the
bend
did
a
solid
on
this
overall
this
one
feel
a
little
short
for
me
because
of
the
flavor
but
with
that
being
said
it
is
definately
worth
a
try
all
in
all
a
fair
esb
a
bit
hoppy
for
my
liking
or
rather
lacking
in
malt
but
its
certainly
tasty
and
an
enjoyable
brew
overall
i
havent
figured
sweetwater
out
yet
i
feel
like
the
are
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
but
i
really
like
this
brew
prickly
as
it
enters
watery
mid
body
and
an
oily
finish
not
that
impressed
by
this
one
d
it
starts
out
strong
with
an
unusually
nice
appearance
and
an
aroma
that
is
encouragingly
close
to
spoton
for
a
traditional
esb
things
kind
of
fall
apart
in
the
finish
as
the
malt
is
too
dark
and
lacking
in
subtly
while
the
hops
are
mostly
bitterness
with
an
oddly
woody
note
not
bad
for
an
american
esb
but
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
it
really
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
proper
british
versions
of
the
style
o
a
really
nice
seasonal
from
sweetwater
tasty
affordable
easy
drinking
and
a
style
that
you
dont
see
a
ton
of
from
american
breweries
o
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
normally
i
consider
esbs
an
inferior
style
it
was
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
surprising
complexity
to
it
overall
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
fruity
sweet
and
bitter
now
its
time
to
pour
another
notes
a
good
solid
beer
from
sweetwater
thanks
to
steven
and
allison
for
bringing
it
along
overall
a
decent
try
misses
some
of
the
yeast
esters
typical
of
an
english
yeast
strain
overall
a
very
solid
ale
and
one
that
could
be
drank
over
and
over
with
much
ease
no
trouble
here
at
all
smells
bready
and
tangy
with
toasted
nutty
and
leafy
notes
as
well
rather
hoppy
for
the
style
with
a
fair
amount
of
citrus
and
pine
flavors
plus
a
distinct
leafy
bitterness
all
this
hoppy
business
distracts
from
the
bready
and
nutty
malts
a
tasty
beer
although
one
that
frankly
tastes
more
like
an
east
coast
ipa
than
an
esb
and
im
docking
points
accordingly
this
beer
is
a
tarnished
copper
color
with
a
head
to
be
proud
of
it
has
a
toasty
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
healthy
herbal
hop
twang
in
the
back
its
sublimely
smooth
and
perhaps
a
tad
slick
with
toasted
grain
all
around
there
are
quick
flashes
of
caramel
sweetness
and
more
of
a
dried
grassiness
in
the
end
the
tamed
hops
add
some
spiciness
and
a
mildly
bitter
herbal
flavor
theres
also
vague
fruitiness
within
the
folds
it
finishes
relatively
dry
with
that
dried
grass
toasted
grain
flavor
this
is
an
offbase
seasonal
we
love
it
because
the
norm
doesnt
need
to
be
the
path
for
everyone
pours
a
deep
russet
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
bitter
citrus
hops
and
some
large
amounts
of
orange
tastes
bitter
from
the
hops
a
little
sweet
from
the
malts
and
a
little
biscuit
and
some
hidden
citrus
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
d
very
drinkable
good
flavor
and
hop
presence
a
wellexecuted
placement
within
the
style
perhaps
leaning
just
a
bit
toward
an
americanized
hoppyness
pleasant
moderately
roasted
caramel
malt
quickly
followed
by
firm
slightly
resinous
hops
flavor
quite
smooth
and
a
good
session
ale
candidate
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
with
some
orange
citrus
hops
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
which
i
was
not
expecting
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
toffee
malt
but
there
are
some
citrus
hops
to
keep
the
beer
nice
and
balanced
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
an
appealing
first
mouthful
and
lots
of
flavors
settles
down
to
an
astringent
bitterness
that
keeps
it
from
being
really
likable
m
vastly
overcarbonated
this
beer
is
sharp
and
painful
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
slick
finish
d
they
go
down
pretty
easy
and
have
a
lower
abv
than
im
use
to
so
decent
beer
for
not
being
to
strong
overall
if
the
smell
of
beer
was
equivalent
to
the
cover
of
a
book
this
would
be
the
gold
standard
in
not
judging
a
book
or
a
beer
by
its
cover
the
taste
turns
out
to
be
far
different
from
the
smell
and
unlike
some
other
esbs
the
motorboat
is
genuinely
bitter
although
the
bitterness
does
level
out
at
the
end
of
each
sip
at
5
6
it
might
be
a
bit
much
to
be
considered
a
true
session
beer
but
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
hot
summer
evening
in
the
southeast
with
a
sixpack
of
motorboats
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
from
a
local
brewery
that
ive
come
to
love
im
happy
to
be
one
of
the
first
100
to
review
this
and
im
even
happier
that
my
local
store
has
a
steady
supply
of
it
while
i
may
not
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
ill
definitely
revisit
it
in
a
mixer
every
now
and
then
another
good
offering
from
sweetwater
this
is
a
very
pleasant
blend
of
caramellike
malt
with
a
flowery
hop
smell
this
continues
through
the
taste
although
the
hops
are
more
prickly
the
aftertaste
is
bitter

d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
outstanding
this
is
a
pretty
colored
brew
pouring
a
thick
light
brown
head
of
fluff
took
a
good
two
minutes
until
i
could
see
the
top
of
the
beer
color
rates
a
great
22
on
the
srm
scale
smell
of
caramel
spice
apple
malt
and
hops
good
rich
bold
taste
of
citrus
caramelized
wheat
sweet
malt
and
a
bitter
hop
finish
lots
of
rich
feel
across
my
tongue
and
the
back
of
my
throat
this
is
a
good
bitter
ale
lots
of
flavor
and
body
give
me
another
got
it
in
the
sweetwater
tackle
box
so
i
have
two
more
yea
went
to
my
local
brewspot
and
had
a
pint
or
three
of
this
sweetwater
original
color
was
dark
red
i
couldnt
see
through
it
but
i
dont
know
the
significance
of
that
in
this
style
of
beer
good
inch
and
a
quarter
thick
head
smell
was
somewhat
dull
not
a
lot
there
not
a
heavy
beer
sat
on
the
stomach
like
a
light
beer
didnt
feel
like
i
had
eaten
a
meal
new
experience
for
me
the
second
gulp
was
significantly
better
than
the
first
one
had
me
ready
for
another
sip
the
only
major
downer
i
could
recognize
was
when
i
burped
it
released
this
awful
smelling
fume
kinda
like
rotten
vegetables
lacing
was
weak
and
i
believe
i
definitely
have
this
one
a
time
or
two
more
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
overpowering
in
the
carbonation
department
a
couple
good
swirls
has
forced
it
to
calm
down
a
bit
im
liking
it
more
the
taste
is
pretty
quite
good
there
was
a
nice
bitter
flavor
followed
up
with
some
sweet
malts
this
to
me
would
be
more
hop
forward
than
most
esb
i
have
drank
it
had
good
carbonation
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
the
problem
i
have
with
this
brew
was
it
meddled
for
the
style
i
just
dont
think
it
that
true
to
a
esb
i
guess
thats
why
i
dont
judge
at
the
gabf
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
very
good
brew
its
a
bitter
yet
its
not
bitter
kind
of
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
style
imo
dont
worry
about
this
one
overall
a
nice
little
beer
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
be
ok
mouthfeel
ws
somewhat
dry
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
a
solid
esb
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
subtle
bitter
hops
in
front
of
mild
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
eathy
hops
just
overpowering
mild
sweet
caramel
malts
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
decent
esb
but
not
one
i
would
likely
pick
that
often
d
without
a
very
complex
taste
against
that
nose
it
loses
drinkability
points
for
me
d
very
drinkable
good
flavor
and
hop
presence
dreally
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
really
like
this
as
a
summer
beer
and
could
see
it
being
a
nice
fishing
beer
my
keg
fridge
is
about
20
for
me
and
80
for
making
my
friends
who
visit
happy
and
festive
this
beer
was
a
huge
hit
with
guests
last
night
when
tapped
i
loved
it
last
night
and
even
more
today
its
flavorful
and
smooth
with
a
great
pour
into
ceramic
mug
i
dont
want
it
to
run
out
which
is
always
the
best
quality
a
home
keg
beer
can
have
really
enjoying

that

disappeared
quickly
some

and
a

of
spicy

waft
up
towards
my
nostrils
as
well
at
first
smell
it
was
a
dead

for
an
american
ipa

as
it
sat
the
nose
definitely
morphed
into
a
more
english

taste
is
malty
with
caramel

brown

minerally
with
that

an
almost
citrusy

in
there
as
well
medium

medium

with
a

this
is
a
weird
little
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
its
like
an
americanized
version
of
an
esb
that
is
still
true
to
its
english
roots
the
good
balance
here
is
what
made
it
work
for
me
with
a
healthy
dose
of
spicy
bitterness
that
kept
things
interesting
and
just
enough
malts
and
citrus
flavor
to
keep
it
in
check
nice
little
take
on
the
style
my
first
tasting
from
sweetwater
and
definitely
not
disappointed
not
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
but
a
very
drinkable
esb
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
big
smell
is
not
too
hoppy
in
the
taste
silky
smooth
mouth
with
nice
midlevel
carbonation
super
session
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
well
done
very
easy
to
drink
stronger
than
expected
body
brings
it
down
just
a
tad
this
is
one
i
could
drink
more
than
my
share
in
one
seating
reddish
copper
hue
under
a
fat
sturdy
head
smells
pretty
green
with
a
toasted
grainy
sweetness
underneath
citrus
and
grass
sweet
malt
flavor
balanced
with
tealike
and
juicy
citrus
hops
not
really
something
to
compare
to
authentic
esbs
this
is
more
like
a
solid
amber
ale
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
gritty
and
creamy
thanks
to
the
low
carbonation
finishing
dry
and
bitter
again
theres
way
too
much
green
hoppy
bitterness
for
this
to
be
a
good
esb
this
is
americanstyle
stuff
but
its
pretty
tasty
whatever
it
is
so
i
have
trouble
faulting
it

leafy

a
nice

esb
but
with
the
citrus
it
feels
more
like
a
caramel
heavy
ipa
i
think
this
is
my
first
esb
so
i
cant
judge
according
to
the
style
from
what
i
gather
from
most
of
the
reviews
this
is
not
at
all
your
typical
esb
so
ill
have
to
sample
some
others
whether
or
not
to
style
its
a
tasty
brew
quite
tasty
if
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
expected
i
dont
know
a
lot
about
esbs
but
you
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
beers
i
think
a
bit
more
malt
in
the
bill
might
make
it
a
bit
more
to
my
liking
but
southern
beers
tend
to
perhaps
understandably
be
somewhat
on
the
light
side
in
body
man
i
like
a
good
esb
and
there
just
isnt
enough
aroundthis
poured

this

ale
is
extremely
well

and
contains
enough
flavor
to
appeal
to
staunch
beer
enthusiasts
but
refined
enough
to
win
over
the
swill
swiggers
as
well
with
a
blend
of
american
and
english
malt
and
hops
it
easily
appeals
to
a
large
audience
an
okay
esb
although
i
would
prefer
the
version
from
england
this
one
had
a
good
amount
of
hops
with
a
decent
amount
of
malts
but
not
enough
balance
in
my
opinion
overall
the
wethopping
influenced
this
beer
more
than
the
cask
conditioning
as
the
carbonation
levels
were
almost
identical
to
the
draught
version
regardless
this
beer
was
hoppy
already
but
the
extra
chinook
pushed
it
to
a
new
level
i
cant
wait
to
try
wet
dream
after
tasting
this
d
i
would
like
to
have
one
or
three
of
these
a
night
not
something
to
drink
a
6
pack
of
in
one
sitting
but
very
enjoyable
drinkability
tasty
brew
that
i
did
enjoy
quite
a
bit
i
do
like
esbs
quite
a
bit
and
although
maybe
its
not
prototypical
it
is
tasty
im
also
bumping
the
score
a
half
a
point
for
the
awesome

and
hilarious

on

side
thanks
much

abitch
notes
only
my
second
english
bitter
and
what
can
i
say
this
must
be
one
of
my
more
favorite
styles
this
beer
tastes
very
nicely
balanced
and
very
good
overall
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
all
of
the
other
sweetwater
pale
ale
varieties
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
try
very
noticable
citrus
hop
scent
backed
by
a
lightly
roasted
caramel
sweetness
all
of
this
is
mirrored
in
the
taste
a
nice
roastiness
to
it
but
the
flavor
falls
short
i
understand
that
this
style
is
not
meant
to
be
a
hop
bomb
but
i
wish
there
was
less
balance
in
this
area
thats
not
to
underplay
this
beer
because
the
lemon
and
light
grapefruit
comes
out
really
nicely
in
the
taste
i
just
wish
there
was
more
there
another
decent
offering
from
sweetwater
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
a
classic
but
rather
enjoyable
misses
the
boat
as
an
esb
no
malt
character
or
no
apple
or
pear
notes
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
esb
way
too
hoppy
for
style
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
overhopped
and
leaves
something
to
be
desired
on
the
malt
side
of
things
it
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
really
what
i
would
prefer
in
an
esb
md
a
nice
sessionable
esb
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
a
solid
beer
pretty
good
but
not
as
bitter
as
it
could
be
overall
very
drinkable
the
texture
is
full
as
well
d
very
smooth
for
craft
drinkers
but
novices
may
have
a
problem
with
the
thickness
future
outlook
for
a
beer
that
is
past
its
prime
this
has
held
up
pretty
well
with
no
off
or
offensive
flavors
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
to
see
if
the
sweetness
is
met
with
more
balance
all
things
considered
a
solid
showing
and
one
that
leaves
me
interested
in
trying
more
sweetwater
product
should
it
become
available
to
me
this
one
pours
out
like

it
has

mild

up

with

this

did

nicely

ill
have
to
remember
this
one
overall
wow
what
a
difference
a
year
makes
either
southern
tier
has
changed
the
recipe
for
this
beer
and
amped
up
the
malt
presence
while
dialing
down
the
hops
which
i
doubt
or
my
palate
has
really
grown
over
the
past
year
to
be
much
more
tolerant
of
hops
as
i
found
this
years
edition
to
be
really
really
tasty
bitter
and
hoppy
with
a
clean
and
dry
finish
very
enjoyable
i
picked
up
this
beer
because
i
saw
in
some
random
internet
article
that
this
was
one
of
10
beers
you
need
to
have
this
fall
well
that
article
was
totally
wrong
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
it
tastes
just
like
a
standard
ipa
even
though
i
dont
think
its
classified
as
such
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
overall
kind
of
an
oddball
but
enjoyable
quaff
taken
on
its
own
another
solid
offering
from
s
t
but
nothing
spectacular
cheers
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
simple
drinker
and
a
more
simple
beer
from
this
brewery
which
tends
to
make
phenomenal
brews
good
taste
and
refreshing
mixed

from

i
was
expected
more

from
this

beer
very

great

overall
a
fine

that
is
certain
plenty
delicious
and
enjoyable
and
the
alcohol
here
is
remarkably
well

but
got
a
nicely

very

and
satisfiying
this
is
a
disappointment
by
southern
tier
standards
its
just
not
as
good
as
a
lot
of
their
other
stuff
that
said
its
still
southern
tier
so
its
still
very
good
and
definitely
worth
trying
its
just
not
on

this
is
definitely
on

esb
which
helps
the

out
a

good
but
i
went
in
with
wrong
expectations
pumpkin

that
is
why
they
need
to
label
a

outside
of
harvest
special
ale
and
seasonal
love
the

of
this
beer
with
all
the
nice

it
off
great
beer
a
marvelous
concoction
if
you
like
this
then
give
fegleys
always

a
try
which
i
believe
is
truly
closer
to
this
esb
style

really
good
beer
lovers
beer
nothing
showy
but
the
mouthfeel
but
i
would
have
another
i
think
this
is
a
great
it
has
a
nice
subtle
sweetness
to
the
smell
which
is
then
complemented
by
a
good
bitter
piney
taste
a
very
nice
seasonal
offering
indeed
i
would
get
this
again
the
taste
begins
briefly
with
a
breaded
toasted
malt
sensation
bu
the
bitter
hops
take
over
in
short
order
lingering
bitter
bite
it
was
not
bad
overall
a
decent
excellent
example
of
an
esb
although
my
bottle
wasnt
too
fresh
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
as
this
would
be
a
good
sessionable
ale
ooverall
a
wellmade
beer
again
by
southern
tier
fairly
moderate
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
nice
citrus
underpinnings
not
the
best
of
the
fresh
hopped
beers
but
a
decent
brew
light
copper
colored
very
fine
carbonation
minimal
bubbles
on
top
theres
a
heavy
citrus
and
pine
smell
sharp
but
pleasing
a
dry
tasting
beer
bitter
but
with
just
enough
malty
sweetness
not
to
make
you
pucker
not
overly
complex
in
terms
of
its
flavors
theres
a
grassyvegetable
flavor
and
some
caramel
notes
too
for
an
esb
it
is
light
in
its
body
very
drinkable
especially
late
in
the
year
pungent
citrus
hoppy
resinous
tones
permeate
throughout
this
beer
it
is
tremendously
hop
forward
the
smell
reminds
me
of
opening
a
hop
bag
before
i
pour
the
contents
into
boiling
wort
this
is
very
crisp
but
not
too
dry
the
hops
linger
on
the
tongue
for
a
good
while
substantially
bitter
and
very
refreshing
o
not
a
bad
esb
i
have
had
a
few
and
this
is
just
above
average
good
beer
good
seasonal
warmer
pours
a
neariridescent
coppered
amber
with
limited
white
head
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
primarily
of
caramelized
malts
the
flavour
starts
with
the
sweet
caramelization
but
transitions
into
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
body
and
finish
although
i
cant
pick
out
specific
varietals
pleased
this
is
an
esb
that
has
met
more
than
just
bittering
hops
o
very
solid
beer
great
fitting
aroma
o
i
guess
i
had
something
else
in
mind
when
i
saw
harvest
ale
written
on
the
six
pack
reminded
me
of
a
runofthemill
ipa
similar
to
harpoon
ipa
however
the
strong
alcohol
bite
turned
me
off
i
like
southern
tiers
other
offering
but
i
can
not
recommend
this
o
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
hops
have
a
little
more
bite
than
id
expect
and
the
malt
base
stays
a
little
safe
and
simple
theyre
well
in
the
ballpark
of
what
the
style
should
be
though
and
its
still
enjoyable
to
drink
o
liking
hop
flavor
makes
me
like
this
one
its
close
to
an
ipa
o
its
not
really
an
esb
in
the
english
beer
sense
but
it
is
quite
good
and
well
worth
trying
as
a
seasonal
rjt
souther
tier
brewery
has
another
wonderful
beer
on
tap
nice
grapefruit
hoppiness
that
seems
to
make
for
a
wonderful
fall
beer
i
actually
thought
it
would
be
a
little
more
bitter
than
what
it
was
maybe
just
because
of
the
food
i
was
eating
with
it
it
is
a
great
go
to
beer
for
the
fall
overall
it
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
a
bitter
but
its
still
an
ok
brew
for
drinking
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
very
carbonated
off
white
head
leaving
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
smell
is
probably
this
beers
best
feature
just
that
typical
great
fall
hoppy
aroma
with
a
nice
grapefruit
twist
i
didnt
think
the
taste
was
all
that
bitter
for
an
esb
this
was
actually
very
easy
to
drink
very
well
balanced
in
addition
to
the
citrusy
taste
i
also
detected
a
sweet
caramel
undertone
think
this
would
be
a
great
thanksgiving
day
session
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
1
inch

smell
is
of
mild
hops
some
malts
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
some
bitterness
a
touch
of
caramel
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
very
drinkable
and
solid
beer
overall
a
very
well
done
strong
bitter
style
ale
the
scent
is
subtle
and
flavors
are
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
nice
fallwinter
style
ale
overall
i
always
seem
to
like
what
southern
tier
is
doing
and
this
is
another
example
of
a
well
made
and
well
balanced
ale
overall
yet
another
good
beer
from
southern
tier
havent
had
anything
from
these
guys
that
i
dont
like
o
pretty
good
as
a
fall
ipa
but
too
many
other
good
ones
out
there
to
search
this
one
out
again
overall
this
is
just
a
great
beer
overall
a
beer
that
would
have
no
problem
with
both
hops
lovers
and
malt
lovers
the
almost
perfect
blend
of
flowery
and
spicy
hops
paired
with
the
sweet
caramellike
malt
is
just
awesome
highly
recommended
for
any
fan
of
craft
beer
cheers
good
stuff
i
like
esb
with
a
bit
more
kick
and
this
has
it
now
o
americanized
esb
anyone
on
the
high
end
for
both
hoppiness
and
alcohol
in
terms
of
the
style
but
it
works
very
well
in
the
context
of
the
beer
it
makes
for
a
great
fall
seasonal
brew
as
it
has
the
slightly
higher
abv
and
the
maltiness
to
go
with
it
st
does
a
great
job
imperializing
some
regular
styles

this

no

psyched

this

one
of
my
favorite
fall

looks
the
color
of

dont
get
a
huge
smell
but
it
could
be
my
dry
nostrils
anyway
i
love
the
taste
of
this
esb
its
definitely
hop
forward
for
an
esb
and
that
makes
it
stand
out
its
not
an
ipa
but
the
hops
and
light
malt
flavor
really
work
here
getting
an
earthy
flavor
along
with
slight
citrus
hops
im
loving
southern
tiers
six
packs
lately
this
is
true
to
the
esb
style
just
a
more
hop
forward
representation
as
is
customary
for
american
beers
ample
amenable
friendly
tasty
and
fat
this
is
a
great
esb
that
you
could
sip
all
day
and
never
tire
of
the
immense
flavor
southern
tier
has
done
a
good
thing
here
you
could
have
a
few
of
these
a
most
excellent
seasonal
from
southern
tier
o
a
fall
seasonal
favorite
excellent
brew
though
its
shelf
life
is
extremely
short
found
that
out
last
year
so
if
you
dont
plan
on
drinking
what
you
have
of
it
fast
stick
to
a
smaller
quantity
overall
quite
an
extreme
esb
that
lingers
in
ipa
territory
im
a
hophead
so
thats
no
issue
for
me
highly
recommended
light
copper
nice
hoppy
nose
the
flavor
profile
and
body
are
a
bit
thin
however
this
is
very
sessionable
but
the
key
to
an
esb
for
me
is
the
mutual
coexistence
between
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
there
is
not
enough
of
a
malt
backbone
here
to
make
me
happy
overall
a
very
odd
beer
for
me
not
sure
really
what
style
to
compare
it
to
there
is
a
lot
going
on
very
complex
beer
southern

overall
a
great
esb
which
will
please
hopheads
but
is
balanced
an
smooth
a
well
blended
beer
id
pick
it
up
again
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
take
to
a
fire
on
a
cool
evening
and
totally
enjoythe
malt
and
hops
balance
each
other
very
well
creating
a
flavorful
beer
without
being
too
robust
and
only
for
the
microbrew
lovera

i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
surprisingly
light
for
better
or
for
worse
in
this
instance
i
actually
preferred
it
light
but
i
could
see
it
being
a
put
off
and
pretty
well
balanced
this
was
a
presumably
slightly
older
bottle
as
harvest
is
pretty
out
now
but
it
was
still
good
was
surprised
to
see
that
this
was
an
esb
for
a
fall
seasonal
calling
itself
harvest
guess
i
missed
that
special
ale
above
an
easy
drinking
beer
as
a
winddown
from
a
day
of
work
this
one
is
just
right
for
a
cool
wet
autumn
evening
this
is
definitely
a
quality
beer
but
the
powerful
and
distinct
flavor
is
almost
too
much
for
my
pallet
the
flavor
doesnt
seem
quite
in
line
with
what
i
would
expect
from
the
name
rather
than
being
a
fallseasonal
beer
it
has
more
of
a
spring
or
summer
vibe
it
is
quite
refreshing
which
would
make
it
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
summer
night
that
said
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
took
weeks
to
get
through
it
because
it
just
wasnt
something
i
wanted
to
taste
regularly
skirts
the
novelty
realm
a
little
too
closely
to
make
it
something
i
would
want
to
revisit
often
but
it
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
overall
the
cloying
smoke
flavor
is
not
for
me
but
it
is
an
average
to
above
average
beer
depending
on
how
much
you
like

extremely

to

for

level
definitely
one
of
the
best
esbs
i
have
had
highly
enjoyable
offering
i
reckon
this
is
far
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
but
nevertheless
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
pumpkin
ale
color
with
a
khaki
head
thick
as
hell
and
about
an
inch
tall
the
nose
is
a
little
bland
maybe
my
bottle
is
a
little
older
than
is
optimal
but
it
smells
like
wheat
and
pale
malt
with
fresh
hops
on
the
floral
side
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
caramely
from
the
malt
but
still
a
little
bitter
and
fruity
from
some
generous
hop
additions
a
little
light
on
the
carbonation
i
thought
but
with
a
nice
round
medium
body
and
a
smooth
feel
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
fall
beer
despite
its
higer
abv
id
gladly
down
a
6er
its
somehow
filling
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
everything
a
fall
beer
should
be
and
nothing
that
it
shouldnt
much
prefered
on
tap
though
o
this
one
had
some
great
balance
and
was
very
drinkable
just
solid
overall
o
no
complaints
here
this
is
a
good
one
subtle
differences
make
this
a
distinct
esb
for
me
overall
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
the
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
is
very
well
done
id
definitely
have
more
in
the
future
bethanys
review
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
somewhat
filling
nice
kick
ok
representation
of
style
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
pints
of
this
brew
o
nice
offtwist
on
a
seasonal
beer
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
brown
ale
or
pumpkin
type
but
definitely
comes
off
like
an
ipa
during
a
season
of
pumpkin
beers
this
fall
ipa
takes
the
cake
as
innovators
of
its
class
o
an
clearly
american
take
on
the
esb
while
staying
fairly
true
to
style
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
would
be
needed
for
the
style
but
i
dont
care
i
like
it
just
the
way
it
is
a
tarnished
gold
body
with
very
little
white
bubbly
head
not
a
whole
lot
of
retention
or
lacing
and
somewhat
uninteresting
aroma
is
of
earthen
hops
even
a
few
months
out
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
allspice
some
other
muddled
grain
and
a
bit
of
lemon
citrus
in
there
as
well
tastes
of
lemon
orange
a
bit
of
corriander
caramel
cardamom
allspice
wheat
and
some
earthen
hops
theres
a
strange
almost
gritty
bitterness
to
it
that
resembles
unintegrated
spices
more
than
alpha
acids
mouthfeel
is
relatively
crisp
and
finishes
clean
save
for
some
lingering
flavors
mostly
the
cardamom
overall
a
decent
beer
thats
refreshing
enough
id
drink
more
of
it
but
wouldnt
exactly
seek
it
out
d
diverse
flavors
and
aromas
makes
this
pretty
enjoyable
nice
to
have
a
fall
seasonal
that
isnt
an
oktoberfest
the
hop
presence
is
significant
as
is
the
malt
diversity
this
is
a
very
good
hoppy
sessionable
brew
here
a
perfect
brew
to
have
on
a
fall
evening
well
this
is
a
wellbrewed
beer
but
its
not
an
esb
its
more
like
an
ipa
for
all
practical
purposes
quite
a
bit
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
not
good
enough
for
me
to
buy
again
the
body
was
crisp
and
smooth
with
the
hops
lingering
on
the
back
for
bit
drinkability
was
good
you
could
too
easily
drink
several
of
these
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
this
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
whiteish
head
its
a
malty
lightly
hopped
smell
with
some
fresh
earth
grain
and
fruit
peach
and
apricot
maybe
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
some
toasted
sweetness
in
the
front
followed
by
a
hop
bitterness
some
herbal
flavors
interesting
beer
very
drinkable
and
full
in
flavor
the
appearance
is
an
amber
color
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
precedes
the
taste
with
a
bunch
of
dark
hops
and
maltiness
after
that
the
dark
bitter
hops
wont
quit
this
is
an
amazing
value
such
a
great
beer
overall
solid
good
beer
for
a
harvest
ale
the
hops
taste
so
fresh
and
crisp
and
the
malted
barley
seems
like
it
just
came
from
the
malt
house
too
happy
to
have
picked
up
this
single
at
the
store
the
other
day
an
enjoyable
beer
a
bit
hopforward
for
the
style
but
still
well
balanced
overall
overall
really
not
the
best
esb
out
there
but
not
bad
either
it
has
a
decent
flavor
profile
with
some
nice
flavors
it
is
well
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
i
was
getting
a
bit
tired
of
marzens
this
fall
and
harvest
provides
a
really
nice
alternative
for
the
season
another
good
one
from
southern
tier
the
taste
has
some
pine
hop
flavors
with
herbs
and
slight
grassy
tinges
with
a
light
dried
fruit
element
from
the
yeast
the
malt
flavor
is
mostly
dry
with
slight
toastiness
you
may
expect
in
a
pale
beer
with
some
nice
caramel
accents
and
the
hops
become
citrus
as
the
finish
arrives
with
some
light
lemon
and
possibly
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
malt
and
yeast
anchor
the
beer
with
some
very
gentle
pear
and
pine
returns
in
the
hop
flavor
as
it
warms
the
overall
take
is
a
good
pale
ale
or
esb
as
it
is
listed
here
with
plenty
of
drinkability
a
very
quaffable
brew
to
my
taste
overall
a
good
seasonal
beer
that
really
comes
across
as
different
than
most
you
might
get
in
the
fall
o
a
good
mix
of
decently
balanced
flavors
that
come
together
for
a
good
autumn
taste
i
found
hints
of
a
pumpkin
ale
slighter
hints
of
an
ipa
and
even
a
brown
ale
interesting
profile
even
if
it
might
be
a
bit
all
over
the
place
for
me
its
not
quite
there
but
its
close
o
i
really
like
this
as
a
fall
beer
especially
as
a
more
simple
alternative
to
a
pumpkin
ale
or
similar
spiced
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
flavor
and
smell
has
a
little
too
much
of
a
leaning
towards
an
ipa
though
another
good
beer
from
southern
tier
o
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
slightly
too
strong
to
be
sessionable
but
from
a
tastesmell
perspective
i
want
to
have
several
of
these
for
some
reason
this
seems
like
a
great
beer
for
an
early
fall
cool
evening
very
loose
foam
rises
quickly
to
around
a
finger
and
falls
back
just
the
same
very
little
retention
offwhite
color
close
to
no
lacing
as
well
the
liquid
is
crystal
clear
and
sparkles
like
freshly
cleaned
glass
for
as
fast
as
the
head
rises
close
to
zero
visible
bubbles
inside
the
glass
light
amber
orange
in
hue
the
nose
features
orange
peel
ginger
root
scones
and
baked
bread
hoppy
in
an
herbaceous
way
not
much
sweetness
here
black
tea
leaves
more
metallic
than
earthy
light
to
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
average
at
best
while
clean
theres
little
life
and
spring
to
its
step
malty
with
cocoa
coffee
bean
toffee
accents
the
orange
to
lemon
citrus
noticeable
more
pine
here
as
well
as
peach
apricot
cherry
fruit
about
half
and
half
grains
versus
fullon
bread
lacks
honey
or
bread
glaze
finishes
with
an
increase
in
florality
and
blanched
nuttiness
that
metallic
edge
about
as
close
to
bitter
as
it
gets
flat
mouth
presence
contributes
to
its
inability
to
interest
you
still
no
real
annoying
flaws
just
the
absence
of
any
superlative
element
o
wonderful
beer
that
is
the
last
esbipa
summer
season
perfect
beer
to
sit
on
the
back
porch
watching
the
leaves
turn
colors
and
enjoy
some
last
rays
of
light
before
winter
gets
in
full
swing
this
beer
really
does
remind
me
of
fall
the
subtle
smokiness
along
with
the
aroma
given
off
by
the
hops
is
kind
of
like
autumn
in
a
glass
a
really
wonderful
seasonal
beer
and
one
i
would
really
like
to
have
again
harvest
is
a
bit
more
bitter
than
expected
which
i
like
toffee
coats
the
palate
with
brown
sugar
and
a
kind
of
pinelike
mixed
with
herbs
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
and
body
bring
this
one
home
and
make
it
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
kinda
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
bottle
o
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
beer
that
is
pleasant
but
it
does
not
go
out
the
way
to
impress
me
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
will
not
be
one
i
seek
out
again
small
head
quickly
dissipates
with
minimal
lacing
golden
amber
color
beer
has
a
nice
earthy
taste
to
it
with
some
hopiness
reminiscent
of
a
pale
ale
definitely
a
different
option
from
many
of
the
other
fall
beers
available
in
my
opinion
a
good
fall
option
for
fans
of
esbs
and
pale
ales
i
enjoyed
the
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
i
thought
the
pine
and
woody
and
earthy
characteristics
blended
very
well
together
bit
too
bitter
for
me
though
and
wish
their
was
more
malt
backbone
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
bitter
a
good
bitter
and
a
reminder
that
its
a
great
style
to
drink
in
the
fall
4
0
o
decent
and
an
interesting
fall
seasonal
but
i
would
take
pumking
over
this
anytime
this
is
a
decent
pub
beer
on
a
cool
autumn
night
o
a
tasty
and
well
rounded
beer
definitely
one
to
keep
on
my
seasonal
radar
o
this
is
a
fantastic
autumn
ale
to
break
up
my
pumpkin
and
oktoberfest
binge
definitely
on
the
verge
of
being
an
ipa
but
who
cares
about
the
style
if
its
a
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
can
surprise
you
when
you
notice
a
different
taste
hiding
amongst
the
others
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
brew
was
the
fresh
aroma
the
hops
were
beautiful
and
the
malts
crisp
and
unique
this
showed
great
complexity
preparing
us
for
a
lighter
beer
than
what
was
delivered
it
was
pretty
heavy
and
appropriate
for
an
autumn
evening
but
certainly
not
after
a
hearty
meal
as
you
might
be
too
full
to
move
i
dont
expect
a
powerhouse
of
flavor
with
this
style
all
i
look
for
is
balance
and
this
beer
definitely
has
that
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
simply
because
esbs
are
not
a
style
i
enjoy
regularly
o
great
brew
going
to
session
this
during
week
1
of
the
2012
nfl
season
in
fact
im
ready
for
another
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
this
is
actually
pretty
close
to
3f
zombie
dust
in
both
taste
and
quality
i
highly
recommend
this
one
make
sure
to
get
it
fresh
its
a
bit
odd
really
but
likeable
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
it
has
a
nice
malt
and
hop
profile
that
is
suited
for
a
fall
day
earthy
and
floral
aromas
and
flavors
rather
than
tons
of
tropical
fruits
i
think
the
apple
esters
also
add
a
nice
touch
to
the
flavor
another
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
from
southern
tier
flavorful
pale
ale
at
a
pretty
reasonable
price
will
get
again
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
was
surprised
how
hoppy
it
was
for
an
esb
it
was
hoppier
than
hopsun
ironically
load
of
citrus
to
it
would
love
to
have
it
again
drinks
too
easy
a
nice
if
not
totally
truetostyle
esb
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
body
with
a
small
1
white
head
that
layed
down
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
has
some
pine
notes
the
taste
has
a
nice
pinehop
taste
up
front
then
finishes
with
a
bitter
taste
the
hop
and
the
malt
are
well
balanced
in
this
one
this
has
a
great
mouth
feel
and
overall
is
pretty
good
beer
very
nice

liked
this
quite
a

as
a

medium

interesting
domestic
variant
on
the
style
very
wellbalanced
esb
thats
a
nice
easy

overall
a
good
beer
for
the
end
of

drinkable
with
out
feeling
like
you
are
drinking

and
hops
are

nicely
creating
a

nothing

very

very
drinkable

overall
a
very

to
make
it

good
robust
flavors
funny
this
one
pleases
on
every
level
although
falls
behind
just
a
couple
steps
where
southern
tier
usually
excels
taste
just
a
little
too
onedimensional
and
who
the
hell
called
this
an
esb
someone
at
southern
tier
really
do
i
need
to
crawl
to
their
website
to
find
out
nah
i
wont
bother
but
its
not
an
esb
even
though
its
bitter
but
quite
good
for
what
it
is
whatever
it
is
somewhere
between
an
american
west
coast
amber
and
pale
ale
hybrid
far
away
from
england
thats
for
sure
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
it
was
smooth
and
the
beer
seemed
a
bit
under
carbonated
but
i
suppose
that
is
more
typical
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
a
bold
and
flavorful
fall
seasonal
o
good
esb
that
is
crisp
refreshing
and
malty
overall
this
is
probably
the
first
beer
that
i
didnt
like
from
st
real
good
stuff
here
even
better
on
tap
with
a
juicy
nectarlike
quality
exceptional
flavor
complexity
and
depth
i
think
this
fits
better
in
the
ipa
category
had
a
decent
bitter
taste
not
overly
bitter
but
a
nice
balance
of
grassy
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
pale
biscuity
malts
to
help
add
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
palate
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
beer
smooth
drinkable
medium
carbonation
dry
finish
a
nice
hoppierbitter
offering
as
opposed
to
most
other
autumn
beers
overall
subtle
flavours
and
good
balance
make
this
brew
tasty
and
smooth
a
solid
american
recreation
of
an
often
overlooked
british
classic
drink
tasty
but
not
wowing
i
like
this
in
12oz
format
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
6
7
is
well
hidden
making
a
potent
beer
but
smooth
none
the
less
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
fast
not
a
lot
going
on
its
a
pretty
simple
brew
that
said
what
is
there
is
done
well
if
youre
looking
for
a
straight
forward
nofrills
esb
then
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
really
up
to
the
standard
ive
come
to
expect
from
southern
tier
not
much
experienice
in
tasting
esbs
but
found
this
brew
to
be
pretty
nice
better
than
some
of
the
pumpkin
flavoured
harvest
beers
that
seem
to
fall
off
the
shelf
this
time
of
year
disappointed
i
only
purchase
a
single
bottle
i
recommend
this
beer
for
the
style
a
nice
alternative
to
the
myriad
of
fall
browns
and
pumpkins
a
clear
pale
orange
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
covering
and
light
lacing
smell
is
rich
with
bready
malt
light
fruitiness
and
and
earthy
hoppiness
taste
is
smooth
and
full
of
bread
and
toasted
grains
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
crisp
hops
that
yield
a
bit
of
grapefruit
and
mild
brown
bread
not
overly
hopped
and
well
balanced
as
it
warms
the
flavors
get
bigger
and
the
malt
blossoms
feel
is
a
light
crisp
signature
with
a
smooth
carbonation
and
medium
weight
a
nice
fall
beer
with
wonderful
drinkability
and
character
odissapointing
southern
tier
makes
another
good
beer
d
not
sure
if
southern
tier
changed
the
recipe
on
this
but
the
bottle
i
had
was
grossly
unbalanced
they
have
plenty
of
better
beers
to
choose
from
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
sizzle
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
for
an
esb
overall
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
brew
starts
like
a
traditional
english
bitter
and
finishes
like
an
american
ipa
it
almost
is
like
a
mimosa
with
a
ipa
replacing
the
champagne
not
bad
at
all
quite
enjoyable
id
had
this
before
in
a
bottle
but
it
must
not
have
been
as
fresh
as
this
because
a
fresh
hop
aroma
really
shined
in
the
draft
version
not
bad
missing
that
depth
in
esbs
and
a
bit
too
hoppy
but
not
bad
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
usstyle
esbs
that
ive
sampled
while
its
not
quite
up
there
with
lord
admiral
nelson
its
certainly
comparable
to
goose
island
harvest
ale
charlevoix
vache
folle
esb
and
cest
what
als
cask
ale
a
fantastic
drinker
o
not
bad
very
unique
for
sure
i
could
drink
this
again
just
nothing
too
special
overall
an
easy
drinking
good
tasting
balanced
beer
pretty
tasty
i
wouldnt
say
its
as
outstanding
as
others
from
southern
tier
like
pumking
and
creme
brulee
stout
though
o
a
nice
drinking
beer
alcohol
hardly
noticeable
nothing
stands
out
here
especially
and
here
this
is
a
strength
moreys
bottom
line
this
beer
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
ontap
and
i
like
it
just
a
bit
better
than
this
years
bottles
very
nice
pours
a
darker
orange
with
yellow
highlights
and
a
small
off
white
head
smell
is
mostly
citrus
hops
and
sweet
notes
some
malty
tones
in
there
as
well
taste
starts
with
the
hops
up
front
the
malt
comes
through
in
the
middle
and
a
semi
sweet
citrus
comes
in
at
the
end
with
the
hops
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
not
much
bitter
going
on
but
nice
flavor
overall
a
nice
medium
body
good
carbonation
always
nice
to
get
one
fresh
off
the
tap
overall
a
good
beer
good
flavor
that
wont
overpower
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
id
drink
it
again
if
i
didnt
have
better
options
i
might
even
buy
it
again
there
are
almost
always
better
options
though
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
could
use
more
in
the
taste
department
other
than
the
bitterness
unique
and
great
makes
me
think
of
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
combined
with
an
oktoberfest
o
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
if
this
was
a
year
round
beer
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
recommend
picking
it
up
of
you
havent
had
it
o
a
decent
malty
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
worth
a
try
o
not
a
particularly
interesting
beer
and
having
one
doesnt
interest
me
in
another
the
abv
doesnt
come
through
but
the
flavor
doesnt
at
all
justify
the
abv
either
i
expect
a
6
7
beer
to
have
a
much
more
robust
flavor
o
very
good
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
at
a
party
or
ballgame
its
partly
the
style
but
i
find
this
beer
to
be
rather
well
meh
its
balanced
and
it
tastes
fine
but
nothings
jumping
out
at
me
its
not
super
flavorful
or
full
of
subtle
complexity
or
refreshing
or
anything
else
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
one
that
i
dont
need
to
revisit
the
flavor
just
didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
but
it
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
hoppy
aroma
brings
to
mind
an
american
pale
ale
not
sure
i
understand
the
esb
classification
here
taste
is
cascadey
hops
with
the
requisite
amount
of
sweetness
from
a
southern
tier
beer
carbonation
was
a
little
low
for
my
liking
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
refreshingly
flavorful
alternative
to
oktoberfests
im
sure
its
even
better
fresh
o
not
a
bad
beer
nice
and
light
with
a
great
flavor
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
taste
follows
nose
pale
try
malt
balanced
by
some
hop
bitterness
nice
balance
and
the
water
in
this
beer
is
a
key
ingredient
too
super
drinkable
beer
an
excellent
session
beer
for
fall
id
seriously
have
considered
sticking
with
this
for
happy
hour
if
there
hadnt
been
so
many
other
choices
to
try
o
this
wont
pass
my
favorite
esb
beast
bitter
however
this
is
way
more
unique
seems
like
harvest
is
a
mad
scientist
type
brew
with
all
the
flavors
going
on
i
will
come
back
to
this
every
single
fall
very
lively
in
the
mouth
the
hops
are
forward
awake
fresh
alive
taste
buds
dance
with
sweet
and
bitter
orange
grapefruit
balanced
by
lively
sweet
bitter
floral
taste
taste
fresh
and
lively
like
a
fall
harvest
very
interesting
in
the
hops
not
being
overly
bitter
yet
very
prominent
pours
a
pale
yellow
amber
with
a
slight
white
head
a
citrus
kick
of
an
aroma
lemon
peel
orange
and
grapefruit
hints
of
spicy
hops
too
flavor
begins
with
crisp
bitter
kick
of
earthy
and
pine
hops
transforms
into
a
sweeter
citrus
blend
a
more
traditional
fall
malt
comes
next
mostly
caramel
and
some
toasted
grain
and
then
some
spicy
hops
and
a
bit
more
citrus
bring
it
home
flavah
similar
spice
character
of
some
marzens
but
has
an
interesting
tussle
with
the
hops
and
loses
decent
malting
balances
well
with
inoffensive
bitter
hops
gives
a
wee
bit
of
the
toasty
warmth
i
would
expect
from
the
nose
but
i
dont
think
it
can
compete
with
the
hopping
and
carbonation
until
it
warms
up
then
the
toasty
comes
through
more
with
a
hint
of
caramel
feels
like
an
american
ale
take
on
an
oktoberfest
which
is
what
i
think
they
were
gong
for
pretty
good
fall
seasonal
offering
taking
a
different
angle
than
most
breweries
overall
not
a
true
fall
beer
but
a
decent
offering
warming
enough
for
the
cooler
months
in
fall
but
the
citrus
was
a
bit
overwhelming
and
kind
of
gave
me
sour
stomach
after
two
if
you
want
a
true
harveststyle
beer
pass
this
one
up
better
suited
for
the
summer
imo
cheers
not
my
favorite
wet
hop
ale
but
still
a
solid
offering
that
i
try
to
knock
back
every
year
o
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
the
season
absolutely
easy
to
down
with
a
wonderfully
balanced
taste
and
pleasant
aroma
o
easy
drinker
tasty
beer
a
good
seasonal
beer
another
solid
beer
from
southern
tier
pours
a
nice
bold
gold
very
few
carb
trailers
but
a
whitish
head
rears
back
to
a
ring
and
sticks
smell
is
a
sweet
floral
hop
and
good
bread
taste
is
very
good
a
good
mixture
of
jagged
hops
with
a
nicely
toasted
malt
backing
effervescent
lively
drinks
well
a
keeper
very
similar
to
gis
harvest
offering
decent
head
retention
light
hop
aroma
nice
hop
presence
with
just
enough
malt
to
balance
light
to
medium
in
body
smooth
carbonation
overall
not
the
best
example
of
a
harvest
ale
it
is
quite
quaffable
nice
as
a
palate
break
in
between
darker
maltier
beers
medium
body
and
carbonation
sticky
a
little
chewy
and
drinkable
solid
fall
beer
which
strikes
a
balance
between
the
seasonal
element
and
the
style
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
decent
but
simple
its
a
good
representation
for
the
style
and
an
easy
drinker
the
rest
a
great
interpretation
of
an
esb
the
combination
of
a
tradational
english
hop
profile
with
a
more
assertive
american
profile
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
quite
tasty
overall
a
very
impressive
americanized
esb
overall
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
around
notes
very
nice
seasonal
surprise
from
st
i
should
have
picked
up
this
one
last
year
overall
a
decent
bitter
beer
but
would
like
to
see
a
more
assertive
malt
presence
transparent
orange
in
body
with
bubbly
white
head
smells
of
grains
corn
and
slight
honey
tastes
of
grains
slight
honey
sone
malt
sweetness
grass
and
hop
resin
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
pleasant
autumn
beer
but
a
terrible
aroma
and
cheap
malt
taste
make
for
an
average
experience
a
highly
drinkable
easy
going
brew
nice
sessionable
brew
easily
accessable
for
parties
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
went
down
smooth
easy
and
is
quite
sessionable
not
a
fall
or
harvest
beer
in
the
typical
sense
this
breaks
the
mold
and
to
me
was
a
great
surprise
and
extremely
drinkable
another
nice
product
by
southern
tier
which
i
recommend
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear

a
small
fizzy

not
hang
around
long
but
good

on

of
green
hops
are
dominating
with
some
nice
floral
notes
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
also
hoppy
but
they
taste
more
like
noble
hops
a
grainy
backbone
asserts
itself
rapidly
battling
with
the
hoppy
bitterness
almost
no
hint
of
the
maltiness
i
detected
on
the
nose
instead
a
delicious
spiciness
adds
a
wonderful
new
element
to
this
esb
texture
is
medium
mediumhigh
carbonation
very
lively
on
the
tongue
texture
is
somewhat
oily
a
wonderfully
different
beer
very
tasty
overall
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
and
a
great
fall
seasonal
southern
tier
has
another
hit
o
impressed
a
nice
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
be
getting
again
the
southern
tier
beers
have
always
impressed
me
with
their
interesting
big
flavored
beers
coming
with
an
affordable
price
tag
this
is
a
nice
and
welcome
change
from
the
seasonal
pumpkin
ales
oa
decent
fall
beer
but
there
seemed
too
much
malt
and
not
enough
bitterness
this
so
much
beer
then
one
fall
beer
that
is
equal
in
style
enjoy
easy
to
drink
harvest
ale
which
is
not
the
best
esb
but
is
worth
a
try
oan
interesting
tasty
ale
for
harvest
time
drinkability
i
really
lie
kthis
beer
and
it
was
a
pleasant
suprise
not
extreme
just
well
done
o
good
easy
to
drink
poured
dark
golden
with
some
reddish
hue
and
moderate
head
retention
great
lacing
and
carbonation
that
sticks
around
as
a
ring
of
foam
around
the
pint
glass
agitating
the
brew
kicks
up
a
nice
creamy
head
and
aromas
of
piney
floral
and
citrusy
hops
great
malt
backbone
lends
a
toasty
biscuity
flavor
becomes
a
little
boozey
as
it
warms
abv
definitely
detectable
here
the
hop
profile
follows
through
to
the
palate
where
piney
and
resiny
flavors
are
present
moderate
bitterness
in
a
finish
that
lingers
for
a
good
amount
of
time
mediumfull
bodied
chewy
for
this
style
of
beer
carbonation
is
low
and
leaves
the
brew
slick
and
syrupy
drank
more
like
a
wellhoped
pale
ale
rather
than
a
bitter
still
a
good
sturdy
brew
for
celebrating
the
harvest
season
o
a
pretty
decent
harvest
ale
has
some
nice
flavors
and
is
a
well
balanced
beer
d
insanely
quaffable
i
was
shocked
to
notice
the
6
7
abv
i
could
drink
several
in
a
sitting
while
enjoying
each
and
every
sip
along
the
way
this
is
a
quality
offering
from
southern
tier
nice
color
clear
efferensence
with
good

lacing
color
a
honeyed
amber
the
smell
speaks
hops
beer
listed
as
an
esb
but
description
focuses
on
the
hops
and
the
hops
i
would
say
is
the
defining
characteristic
of
this
beer
not
an
esb
per
say
but
a
hop
forward
ale
i
really
liked
this
beer
great
mouthfeel
and
a
subtle
complex
flavor
profile
the
malt
is
there
but
the
hops
is
the
lingering
taste
still
does
not
dominate
like
the
balance
and
the
body
of
this
beer
i
would
agree
hoppy
enought
to
satisfy
and
stand
up
to
spicymexican
but
with
a
deep
enough
body
to
speak
of
fall
first
harvest
of
the
season
and
a
good
one
3rd
favorite
st
so
far
after
pumking
and
chokolat
o
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
impressed
by
it
first
time
having
this
one
and
i
enjoyed
it
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
enojoyable
for
the
style
but
the
aromas
take
this
one
to
another
level
imo
recommended
o
another
tweener
beer
from
southern
tier
i
much
prefer
when
they
stay
true
to
style
their
ipas
stouts
than
hop
up
an
existing
style
good
but
not
great
not
really
an
esb
imo
but
its
all
good
by
me
hoppy
pale
ale
with
english
malt
is
what
im
thinking
glad
i
found
this
within
a
month
of
bottling
as
its
quite
delicious
and
flavorful
in
its
own
southern
tier
way
without
all
the
alcohol
i
would
do
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
sunday
in
a
second
hop
intensity
allows
for
an
extended
finish
and
carrying
only
the
most
modest
hint
of
caramel
into
aftertaste
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
whets
the
whistle
on
these
hot
autumn
days
but
satisfying
for
cooler
nights
as
well
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
pumpkin
and
marzen
soaked
market
that
fall
brings
its
definitely
a
hop
heads
fall
beer
o
pretty
good

with

i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
my
bad
for
ordering
this
i
was
hoping
for
a
hopped
to
hell
harvest
ale
this
wasnt
bad
just
more
balanced
the
the
name
led
me
to
believe
i
expected
a
bit
more
out
of
this
brew
theres
no
bottle
date
anywhere
to
be
seen
on
the
packaging
but
its
relatively
fresh
ive
had
better
esbs
pours
a
solid
clear
clean
copper
with
a
2
finger
head
that
fades
to
a
14
inch
tight
bubbled

the

feel

medium
feel
creamy

smooth
going
down
crisp
and
bitter
going
down
all
in
all
this
beer
is
great
lots
of
nice
hop
flavors
with
a
solid
malt
back
solid
bitter
from
st
o
was
looking
for
a
good
fall
seasonal
and
chose
this
because
i
was
a
big
fan
of
souther
tiers
2x
ipa
definitely
not
bad
by
any
means
however
it
left
a
little
to
be
desired
just
didnt
have
as
much
of
the
autumn
tones
and
feel
i
was
expecting
would
definitely
recommend
to
a
noncraft
drinker
however
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
it
but
it
felt
like
it
was
right
on
the
verge
of
being
a
very
good
beer
but
quite
quaffable
and
refreshing
this
beer
poured
a
nice
creamy
head
kinda
white
lasting
a
long
time
covering
an
orangebrown
bright
brew
that
looked
so
good
kudos
to
the
brewer
for
that
head
which
holds
out
beautiful
aroma
big
time
hop
fruit
tropical
citrus
pine
totally
west
coast
so
to
speak
flavor
has
a
huge
hop
presence
that
easily
stomps
out
the
malt
get
more
balance
in
the
finish
as
some
specialty
malts
bust
through
lots
of
hops
went
into
making
this
beer
ah
cool
idea
although
it
was
different
from
what
i
usually
look
for
in
my
autumn
beer
enjoying
this
anyway
a
bit
early
for
a
harvest
ale
supposed
fresh
english
hops
not
likely
nice
fall
look
and
color
nose
is
the
first
give
away
that
something
is
missing
first
taste
confirms
metallic
pineapple
juice
finish
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
stand
out
in
the
harvest
category
overall
harvest
ale
is
an
enjoyable
quaffable
brew
for
early
sunday
morning
drinking
o
would
have
loved
to
have
this
one
fresh
ill
probably
pick
up
more
this
coming
fall
45
of
these
in
one
sitting
easy
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
hard
on
the
wallet
good
representative
of
the
style
and
easy
to
find
the
harvest
ale
pours
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
yellowish
colored
head
on
top
the
heads
a
little
foamy
and
kind
of
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
on
the
nose
theres
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
there
too
to
counter
the
sweetness
the
taste
is
also
a
little
sweet
but
has
a
good
backbone
of
malts
and
some
spices
also
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
has
a
medium
body
overall
its
a
nice
drinkable
brew
that
id
probably
drink
again

a

of
what

aipas
almost
ipas
the

is
still
where
much
of

the

is

really

be
keeping

that
st
has
got
it
right
on
this

with
a
nice

the

it
almost
makes
it
as

as
2xipa

not
as
much
since
it
is

have
to
try
next

the
spot

rank
it
as
my

far
up
there
with

as
one
of
their
most
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
d
a
very

was
a
just
a

over

for
my
liking

not
bad
thanks
again
michael
for
sending
me
these
d
im
definitely
a
hop
head
and
this
has
a
great
hop
flavor
without
being
overpowering
with
the
light
body
and
moderate
flavor
i
could
drink

easily
d
a
solid
esb
pours
a
light
amber
with
some
copper
highlights
and
a
fairly
thin
head
smells
somewhat
grainy
and
a
touch
buttery
some
clean
malt
and
some
light
earthy
hops
rounds
it
out
tastes
pretty
similar
with
buttery
overtones
and
a
firm
malt
and
grain
base
somewhat
savory
as
well
almost
like
salted
caramel
but
not
all
that
sweet
smooth
somewhat
chewy
and
with
a
nice
salty
sweet
finish
interlaced
with
some
bitterness
i
like
it
and
it
seems
appropriate
for
the
fall
d
this
is
a
pretty
high
octane
esb
by
any
standard
but
i
certainly
didnt
detect
any
of
that
good
stuff
d
very
high
i
sought
out
a
case
of
this
after
enjoying
a
single
but
all
i
could
turn
up
was
two
sixpacks
this
is
a
solid
easydrinking
brew
that
is
well
worth
a
try
in
the
fall
it
has
some
interesting
hop
flavors
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
my
only
disappointment
is
that
i
didnt
buy
more
overalli
enjoyed
the
beer
a
different
kind
of
esb
than
ive
had
a
lot
more
fruit
and
spice
character
but
it
pulls
it
off
worth
your
time
this
is
an
interesting
fall
seasonal
its
not
my
personal
favourite
but
i
cant
really
see
too
much
to
fault
with
it
give
it
a
shot
a
tasty
refreshing
and
delicious
esb
fruity
citrus
aroma
with
light
grainy
malt
clear
bright
goldenyellow
pour
with
a
thick
white
head
and
some
lacing
light
and
fresh
on
the
palate
mellow
and
easy
going
its
a
real
drinkable
beer
flavor
of
pine
with
with
a
mild
bite
fresh
hop
taste
with
a
mild
malt
backbone
sort
of
has
a
dry
grassywheat
quality
as
well
another
good
one
from
southern
tier
i
have
to
admit
after
my
first
tasting
a
few
yrs
ago
rt
has
totally
changed
my
mind
they
really
produce
some
world
class
brew
pours
a
nice
golden
copper
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
good
ringy
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
a
good
amount
of
hops
forward
with
some
earth
pine
and
herbal
notes
coming
through
slight
caramel
and
toffee
in
there
as
well
hops
take
center
stage
in
the
flavor
as
well
though
not
to
the
extent
that
they
had
in
the
nose
really
nice
body
and
carbonation
well
nice
bitterness
really
smooth
and
a
great
fall
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
brew
over
the
summer
lighter
wheat
beers
are
not
my
preferred
style
but
this
fills
the
gap
between
those
and
a
medium
bodied
ipa
drinkability
wow
very
surprised
when
i
first
researched
this
beer
after
drinking
it
a
few
nights
ago
goes
down
deliciously
and
effortlessly
but
is
also
delicious
and
not
very
offensive
if
you
enjoy
roasted
but
sweet
beers
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
can
get
a
hold
of
it
before
fall
is
over
cheers
thanks
again
joe
light
side
of
medium
bodied
really
slides
down
with
enjoyment
similar
to
the
goose
harvest
ale
but
this
has
more
flavor
drinkability
is
great
this
is
my
favorite
fall
beer
its
got
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
but
is
way
easier
to
drink
a
bunch
of
than
most
ipas
drinkability
goes
down
a
but
with
that
lingering
astringent
bitterness
and
cotton
mouth
finish
other
than
the
finish
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
drinks
pretty
well
d
overall
southern
tier
harvest
is
a
wonderful
fall
seasonal
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
this
comes
out
the
right
time
of
year
because
it
is
a
perfect
football
beer
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pine
resin
and
fresh
grapefruit
it
is
so
fresh
smelling
it
makes
me
feel
as
though
i
am
actually
in
a
forest
of
pine
and
grapefruit
trees
the
taste
is
similar
in
character
but
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
there
is
also
a
hint
of
orange
in
the
finish
bitterness
is
well
integrated
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
surely
drink
again
a
real
aggressive
pour
yielded
about
three
inches
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
atop
a
clear
honey
colored
brew
the
smell
is
fantastic
theres
a
big
pine
hit
followed
by
tropical
fruits
and
a
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
really
crisp
and
refreshing
i
know
this
is
a
fall
seasonal
but
id
love
to
have
this
in
the
dog
days
of
summer
citrus
up
front
followed
by
a
slightly
sweet
mango
note
and
a
lingering
bitterness
fused
with
pine
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
all
in
all
i
really
liked
the
crisp
feel
and
refreshing
flavors
despite
the
typical
fall
seasonal
most
expect
id
like
to
see
this
around
all
the
time
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
finebubbled
offwhite
head
aroma
is
seriously
hoppy
with
evergreen
and
yeasty
hints
hoppy
flavor
is
evergreen
but
not
too
bitter
and
has
hints
of
fruit
and
even
coffee
tingly
fizzy
texture
fairly
dances
on
the
tongue
this
is
my
second
harvest
ale
in
the
last
few
weeks
the
other
being
from
goose
island
while
i
prefer
the
goose
island
ale
this
is
well
worth
trying
this
one
is
well
balanced
for
me
yum
d
decent
american
esb
a
lighter
drinker
that
isnt
overly
exciting
d
at
6
4
it
aint
quite
sessionable
but
i
can
see
myself
happily
trying
anyway
the
taste
is
delicious
it
is
a
wonderful
fall
beer
that
keeps
the
hops
at
the
forefront
this
is
not
often
done
or
at
least
i
havent
found
this
happening
often
will
the
harvest
beers
mouth
feel
is
definitely
creamy
and
smooth
if
i
had
more
to
drink
i
would
drink
a
few
more
of
these
tonight
very
drinkable
and
will
be
bought
again
copper
in
color
with
an
amber
hue
poured
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
strong
white

reduced
to
a
thick

cap
sweet
biscuity

and
grapefruit
hop
aromas
smooth

feel
with
healthy
carbonation
nice
balance
of

flavors
with
a
grapfruit
hop
finish
wnet
down
smooth
and
quickly
southern
tier
never
disappoints
if
you
didnt
tell
me
this
was
an
esb
i
would
have
classified
it
as
an
apa
either
way
this
quickly
became
one
of
my
favorites
drink
well
my
friends
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
clean
with
an
adequate
amount
of
carbonation
d
very
nice
this
esb
manages
to
hit
all
the
right
notes
and
it
remains
quite
drinkable
despite
being
a
significantly
stronger
than
average
example
of
the
style
interestingly
it
has
a
somewhat
american
hop
aroma
but
the
hops
turn
a
bit
more
musty
and
british
in
the
flavor
the
malt
character
is
well
done
as
well
there
is
a
huge
note
of
toasted
malt
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
to
keep
it
form
becoming
burnt
tasting
and
cloying
in
the
finish
as
it
has
a
tendency
to
do
in
some
drier
beers
i
would
happily
recommend
this
beer
and
drink
it
again
pours
a
clear
light

toasty

toasted

mouthfeel
carbonation
is
good
but
it
thins
out
pretty
fast
hoppy
with
a
musty
nutty
note
works
as
a
fall
seasonal
aug
rel
d
this
is
a
wee
bit
about
average
ale
the
mouth
feel
is
really
the
only
thing
that
suffers
but
at
the
same
time
it
makes
this
category
suffer
slightly
also
dgreat
truly
drinkable
to
the
last
drop
and
i
drank
it
rather
quickly
its
gone
now
and
im
sad
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
drink
another
above
average
beer
by
southern
tier
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
good
a
very
pleasant
experience
especially
for
a
hophead
mostly
clear
coppery
and
slightly
amber
color

sticks
around

some
roasted

as
well
plenty
of
sweetness
mixes
well
with
floral
hops
medium
bodied
with
a
slightlytoo
crisp
mouthfeel
but
refreshing
nonetheless
overall
a
nice
warming
brew
for
the
season
overall
this
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
once
it
warms
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
i
would
drink
it
again
d
this
is
something
i
could
go
with
all
night
overall
a
very
nice
offering
from
st
pretty
drinkable
i
really
like
the
fruit
flavors
in
this
one
poured
this
into
a
tulip
slightly
hazy
amber
body
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
with
nice
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
full
of
floral
hops
and
is
slightly
citrusy
mostly
hops
though
with
nice
bitterness
and
a
slight
malt
aroma
kicking
around
the
background
the
taste
is
upfront
with
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
citrus
the
finish
is
bitter
and
rather
earthy
good
mouthfeel
on
this
one
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
ill
pick
up
more
of
these
d
a
good
esp
in
fact
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
id
say
its
a
nice
drinking
fall
beer
that
has
good
balance
and
a
harmonious
flavor
profile
d
the
drinkability
is
decent
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
i
dunno
how
interested
it
would
keep
me
good
beer
but
a
one
and
done
for
me
d
wonderful
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
seasonals
so
much
flavour
it
fits
the
time
of
year
so
perfectly
the
perfect
beer
to
have
on
the
patio
with
a
nice
sweater
on
a
cool
breeze
in
the
air
and
the
leaves
all
changed
d
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
harvest
would
have
liked
more
than
the
pine
to
come
through
but
oh
well
still
a
solid
beer
this
is
a
repeat
performer
for
sure
flavor
not
too
big
refreshing
enough
to
come
back
for
more
if
i
can
wax
poetic
for
a
minute
its
great
to
see
fall
evoked
in
a
different
way
from
the
pumpkin
ales
oktoberfests
both
of
which
i
also
love
this
brings
to
mind
the
crinkle
of
fallen
leaves
the
crispness
of
autumn
evening
air
the
fading
daylight
more
of
farewell
to
summer
beer
i
appreciate
that
this
is
reminiscent
of
the
season
actually
changing
id
like
to
say
more
but
ive
gotta
finish
savoring
this
beer
drinkthis
brew
taste
alot
like
troegs
nugget
nectar
i
thought
with
a
bitter
and
somewhat
sweet
delivery
would
not
consider
this
to
be
a
session
beer
due
to
the
odd
balance
it
has
md
soft
on
the
tongue
basically
an
india
brown
ale
not
to
infringe
on
anyones
copyrights
good
beer
ill
gladly
drink
it
tonight
overall
from
the
appearance
and
aroma
i
expected
good
things
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
a
let
down
i
would
drink
again
if
offered
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
very
good
esb
and
it
works
as
a
fall
beer
too
nicely
balanced
with
surprising
complexity
both
in
the
hop
and
malt
tastes
fall
nights
are
looking
better
already
d
good
drinkable
beer
nothing
super
special
but
not
bad
d
nothing
outstanding
here
but
a
good
beer
d
this
was
a
good
harvest
beer
but
one
that
is
a
little
lower
on
my
list
good
for
what
it
is
very
drinkable
thats
for
sure
not
much
going
for
it
i
would
say
although
ive
had
a
lot
of
harvest
beers
d
this
beer
has
a
big
spicy
hop
flavor
that
is
supported
by
some
interesting
pale
malt
flavors
the
green
bean
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
the
hops
and
malt
just
dont
seem
to
work
together
but
on
their
own
they
are
not
bad
a
great
earthy
heartiness
to
this
beer
floral
aroma
transcends
into
sweet
backbone
very
good
harvest
ale
nice
and
hoppy
d
i
shall
look
forward
to
this
release
for
years
to
come
damn
nifty
if
i
do
say
so
myself
d
a
solid
drinkable
version
of
an
esb
this
beer
is
great
alternative
to
the
more
malty
altbiers
that
are
typically
offered
in
the
autumn
but
one
or
two
should
suffice
on
a
nice
autumn
afternoon
highly
drnikable
one
of
my
favorites
thus
far
this
fall
very
good
entry
as
an
esb
lots
of
bitterness
good
starting
malt
flavors
spot
on
body
but
with
a
lower
level
of
a
carbonation
long
lasting
aftertaste
of
peppery
hop
bitterness
as
mentioned
several
times
above
very
light
in
its
characteristics
certainly
more
could
have
been
done
with
this
recipe
an
unfortunately
average
offering
from
an
otherwise
excellent
brewery
great
beer
to
drink
very
pleasant
flavors
nice
body
and
just
all
around
enjoyable
tough
to
judge
in
the
esb
category
but
great
in
general
d
this
is
an
interesting
brew
again
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
by
the
end
it
tastes
like
an
esb
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
great
effort
by
southern
tier
i
dont
really
know
anything
about
this
beer
i
just
saw
it
at
total
wine
and
figured
id
pick
it
up
its
extremely
flavorful
and
a
nice
showcase
for
some
tasty
hops
recommended
overall
a
delicious
surprise
from
an
otherwise
dull
and
uninviting
style
st
yet
another
great
brew
d
good
flavor
with
no
alcohol
noticeable
pretty
light
on
tongue
but
refreshing
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
and
this
leads
me
to
believe
the
bottle
i
had
earlier
was
not
all
that
fresh
or
the
batch
variations
are
quite
large
either
way
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
ontap
or
in
the
bottle
near
the
release
date
a
very
nice
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
head
that
smells
quite
hoppy
zesty
aromas
are
stronger
than
the
toasty
malt
aromas
but
the
taste
is
more
balanced
citrusy
and
earthy
hops
dominate
the
front
palate
and
finish
but
toasty
and
lightly
sweet
malts
shine
through
on
the
middle
and
make
the
overall
experience
much
rounder
a
pleasantly
bold
seasonal
prost
md
carbonation
is
slightly
prickly
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
balanced
beer
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
copper
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
earthy
malt
hops
and
a
hint
of
spice
fits
the
style
of
an
extra
special
strong
bitter
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
floral
hops
sweet
malt
slight
earthy
malt
slight
yeast
and
a
hint
of
spice
overall
decent
aroma
body
and
blend
overall
this
is
a
killer
brew
a
fresh
hop
brew
or
just
a
killer
amber
with
some
bad
ass
hops
i
dont
know
but
it
is
full
of
hop
flavors
and
i
like
them
edit
i
just
came
across
some
notes
from
a
previous
tasting
likely
last
fall

had
very

isnt

but
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
around
all
the
time
easy
drinking
and
flat
out
delicious
my
favorite
beer
from
southern
tier
if
you
can
find
this
while
its
in
season
dont
pass
it
up
di
can
see
this
being
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
not
bad
either
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
have
to
say
even
for
someone
who
doesnt
particularly
care
for
hops
thanks
to
the
balanced
taste
and
pleasing
mouthfeel
my
first
esb
experience
was
an
enjoyable
one
might
actually
have
to
give
some
more
of
these
a
shot
mouthfeel
is
generously
carbonated
and
lightbodied
with
the
drinkability
being
deservingly
high
basically
this
beer
is
not
as
bitter
as
one
might
expect
and
fulfills
the
flavor
responsibility
quite
nicely
bravo
southern
tier
m
d
nice
and
lightmedium
body
with
a
good
tasty
and
spicy
mouthfeel
that
is
very
appropriate
for
the
season
yet
not
bad
for
warmer
hours
of
the
day
drinkability
is
very
high
delicious
t
i
was
expecting
more
harvest
taste
from
this
whatever
that
means
but
overall
its
a
pleasant
beer
balanced
hops
with
some
roasted
malt
undertone
its
certainly
appropriate
for
fall
weather
not
getting
the
spices
on
the
tongue
that
i
was
able
to
smell
serving
type
bottle
d
sessioning
is
possible
very
good
overall
an
drinking
easy
drinking
esb
a
very
golden
color
with
a
sexy
pure
white
head
smells
likes
autumn
i
feel
like
im
stepping
out
of
my
warm
apartment
into
the
crisp
october
morning
air
very
up
front
hoppy
taste
which
gives
way
to
a
more
traditional
ocktoberfest
brew
with
a
hint
of
spice
very
thick
when
swooshing
it
around
the
mouth
but
i
think
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
a
solid
contender
for
the
style
definatly
fit
my
hop
needs
well
and
is
balanced
to
boot
pale
and
hazy
golden
light
and
fluffy
white
head
lacing
is
pretty
full
cascade
like
grapefruit
aroma
mixed
in
with
some
light
toffeeish
malt
firm
malt
base
of
toffee
and
caramel
bright
and
exuberant
hop
flavor
resiny
and
spicy
and
a
little
of
that
garliconion
character
medium
bodied
at
best
and
creamy
solid
beer
drinks
well
a
bit
too
strong
abvwise
to
have
many
in
a
sitting
but
i
want
to
tastes
like
a
good
harvest
this
year
a
really
nice
option
when
you
want
something
with
lots
of
hops
without
the
serving
being
too
heavy
theres
a
refreshing
quality
to
southern
tiers
harvest
ale
its
a
bit
of
a
shame
that
this
isnt
available
year
round
but
its
something
to
look
forward
to
at
the
end
of
summer
its
also
a
nice
reminder
that
pumking
is
just
around
the
corner
mmmmm
pumking
i
needed
another
bottle
to
finish
my
mixed
sixer
at
ricks
so
i
picked
this
guy
exciting
i
know
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
cotton
flowers
and
buttery
biscuits
the
taste
holds
notes
of
banana
orange
peel
hoppy
bitterness
and
wheat
the
body
is
light
with
a
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
offering
one
to
grab
again
if
i
ever
need
to
finish
another
mixed
sixer
d
easy
drinking
could
throw
back
a
few
of
these
d
incredibly
high
thought
i
might
get
sick
of
it
but
its
a
delicious
beer
with
an
abv
below
7
great
beer
a
must
try
taste
more
pine
and
resiny
flavors
coming
through
than
i
got
in
the
smell
still
pretty
fruity
i
expected
higher
bitterness
bitterness
seems
kinda
mild
highly
drinakable
a
great
refreshing
hoppy

balanced
apaesb
d

4
5
overall
ive
had
better
from
southern
tier
maybe
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
the
guys
at
mugs
use
dish
soap
to
clean
their
glasses
or
maybe
esb
is
just
not
their
thing
my
sister
sent
me
some
harvest
from
my
hometown
brewery
clear
golden
yellow
pour
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
and
great
lacing
really
big
nose
for
an
esb
lots
of
pine
grapefruit
and
grass
with
just
a
touch
of
bread
dough
taste
is
quite
like
the
nose
with
lots
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
to
nicely
compliment
the
biscuity
malt
fruitier
than
most
esbs
with
a
hint
of
tea
also
nice
dry
finish
and
a
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
a
cask
ale
a
very
unique
and
drinkable
esb
brilliant
glimmering
golden
white
head
fizzes
a
bit
but
settles
nicelya
ring
and
some
stringy
horizontal
strands
of
lace
appear
with
a
wispy
centre
nose
is
sweet
tangerine
mango
peach
tropical
fruit
marmalade
the
big
smell
is
impressive
wow
taste
is
citrus
rind
with
big
hoppy
first
impressions
bold
yet
very
drinkable
this
tastes
like
a
stone
fruit
orchard
passed
through
it
with
a
dash
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
sharp
earthy
malty
edges
bitter
aftertaste
is
dry
very
pleasant
interesting
presentation
but
again
theres
a
spicy
backdrop
im
getting
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
not
quite
nutmeg
or
cinammon
but
moving
in
that
direction
another
fine
brew
from
southern
tier
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
brewery
picked
up
as
a
single
in
wi
pours
a
pale
clear
golden
color
with
two
inches
of
white
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
i
have
noticed
that
most
of
these
harvest
ales
are
very
pale
and
this
one
is
no
exception
nice
hoppy
aroma
of
pine
grass
and
citrus
a
touch
of
graininess
as
well
the
flavor
is
likewise
hopcentric
bitterness
is
a
bit
high
for
an
esb
i
would
put
it
at
apa
levels
there
is
a
bit
of
bready
malt
that
helps
balance
the
pine
and
citrus
flavors
nice
smooth
body
and
carbonation
nicely
compliments
the
flavors
in
this
beer
i
would
consider
this
one
of
my
favorites
when
it
comes
to
these
harvest
ales
slightly
more
balanced
and
drinkable
as
mentioned
several
times
above
very
light
in
its
characteristics
certainly
more
could
have
been
done
with
this
recipe
an
unfortunately
average
offering
from
an
otherwise
excellent
brewery
pours
a
light
pale
straw
color
with
no
carbonation
activity
after
the
pour
i
am
not
getting
any
head
or
cling
to
the
glass
after
the
pour
i
am
getting
subtle
alcohols
notes
in
the
smell
there
is
a
good
hoppy
bitterness
that
is
backed
by
a
citrus
orange
maybe
note
to
finish
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
if
you
like
the
bitterness
that
is
associated
with
esbs
overall
an
average
beer
probably
something
i
wouldnt
get
again
but
it
was
nice
to
have
an
opportunity
to
drink
it
received
this
as
an
extra
from
billab914
and
i
am
thankful
to
try
any
sothern
tier
offerings

leaving
no

bright
rich
golden
color
very
clear
with
a
scattering
of
lazy
bubbles
rising
the
aroma
is
a
bit
mild
fresh
hops
and
a
light
orangey
citrus
no
real
malt
character
coming
through
the
taste
hits
me
with
tangerine
hops
lightly
sweet
kinda
reminds
me
of
those
little
orange
bubble
gums
that
came
in
those
mini
juice
cartons
good
sturdy
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
actually
a
little
noticeable
which
isnt
the
best
quality
in
a
smaller
session
beer
finishes
with
a
good
juicy
bitterness
and
a
faintly
grainy
toastiness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
with
a
deep
lingering
bitterness
this
beer
drinks
nice
and
easy

a
sixer
is
a

high
but
whatev
drinkability
off
the
hook
this
is
a
super
tasty
fresh
hop
or
wet
hop
and
done
really
well
its
not
brashly
bitter
but
it
has
a
nice
fruity
hoppiness
that
is
really
tasty
i
feel
that
a
lot
of
sts
beers
have
taken
a
turn
for
the
worse
lately
but
this
one
is
still
good
or
got
better
maybe
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
thanks
much

pours
a

gold
color
with
a
modest
amount
of
head
good
clarity
and
overall
a
very
nice
looking
beer
hop
aroma
is
fantastic
i
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
a
lot
of
sweet
citrus
aroma
that
is
very
appealing
taste
is
also
very
good
lots
of
sweet
citrus
hops
up
front
with
some
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
finish
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
id
like
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
that
isnt
compromised
by
a
carbonation
bomb
i
think
i
could
get
a
better
handle
on
it
still
theres
enough
here
to
let
me
know
that
this
is
a
beer
id
have
again
recommend
an
excellent
session
beer
without
having
to
sacrifice
flavor
reminds
me
a
little
of
their
hop
sun
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
im
a
fan
poured
way
to
light
it
was
a
pale
yellow
color
like
a
pils
with
a
small
white
head
it
all
dissipated
and
left
just
a
flat
yellow
liquid
in
the
glass
not
impressed
the
smell
was
faint
in
all
areas
faint
hops
and
malt
no
real
aroma
here
just
plain
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
not
a
strong
or
bitter
brew
not
hoppy
or
malty
pretty
much
tasted
like
a
budwieser
just
awful
do
not
recommend
this
one
at
all
poured
this
one
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
comes
out
a
very
pale
yellow
gold
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
i
was
actually
really
dissapointed
on
first
glance
till
i
took
a
2nd
look
at
it
there
was
a
really
thick
frothy
head
to
it
with
lots
of
different
sized
bubbles
almost
a
creamy
frothy
look
a
good
chunk
of
the
froth
goes
away
about
a
fourth
of
the
way
through
the
drink
and
a
ring
stays
on
the
edges
with
a
skim
of
froth
across
the
surface
you
get
a
little
bit
of
lacing
that
sticks
in
small
patches
all
over
the
glass
you
can
also
see
in
the
haze
what
looks
like
citrus
zest
floating
around
all
over
the
smell
is
great
hops
dominate
the
smell
here
primarily
citrus
hops
smell
dry
hopped
much
like
the
famous
hazed
and
infused
by
boulder
the
taste
is
also
phenomenal
still
pleasantly
hoppy
with
again
primary
citrus
hops
likely
some
pine
hops
but
im
thinking
mostly
citrus
dry
hops
the
malts
are
clearly
present
but
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
it
strikes
me
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
esb
it
has
some
bitter
bite
to
it
from
the
hops
but
all
in
all
pretty
darn
good
this
one
extremely
drinkable
beer
willing
to
go
with
flawless
for
drinkablity
very
little
to
pick
on
about
this
beer
maybe
it
could
have
been
a
little
maltier
and
heavier
but
overall
its
a
pretty
well
thought
out
brew
this
could
easily
be
a
year
round
beer
i
like
southern
tier
going
hoppy
for
their
fall
seasonal
good
idea
on
their
part
na
zdravje
when
i
poured
this
beer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
expected
more
the
head
was
almost
nonexistant
and
the
color
as
very
light
almost
orange
i
really
expected
something
more
golden
with
a
more
pronounced
head
with
that
said
it
does
leave
a
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
the
aromoa
is
very
pleasing
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
taste
and
after
all
that
is
really
whats
most
important
the
taste
of
hops
really
came
through
and
the
finish
very
pleasant
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
another
tomorrow
with
the
fried
turkey
dinner
i
am
preparing
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
a
lot
bigger
than
the
color
suggests
carbonation
is
nice
and
light
this
is
made
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
and
i
drank
both
of
my
bottles
consecutively
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
less
bitterness
as
that
would
really
put
this
beer
over
the
top
feel
and
drinkabilty
light
on
the
palate
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
this
is
one
incredibly
drinkable
beer
not
sure
of
the
alochol
here
but
i
feel
that
this
one
would
make
a
good
session
this
almost
drinks
like
an
american
macro
its
that
easy
to
drink
its
much
tastier
and
all
the
more
drinkable
than
that
swill
the
carbonation
isnt
obnoxious
as
in
bmc
brews
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
or
have
with
food
or
just
to
session
light
and
refreshing
cant
beat
that
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
up
the
glass
very
floral
and
citrus
hop
aromas
flavors
of
sweet
citrusgrapefruit
and
orange
honey
and
apricot
with
a
lemon
rind
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
a
clean
crisp
and
dry
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
harvests
ive
ever
had
suprised
its
not
a
marzan
but
for
an
esb
and
specially
hopped
pretty
good
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
this
grab
it
before
it
runs
out
overall
very
enjoyable
flavorful
beer
i
could
drink
this
one
quite
steadily
d
this
is
definitely
a
late
summer
early
fall
beer
i
wouldnt
label
it
as
an
esb
but
rather
a
pale
ale
almost
anyways
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
favors
the
hops
and
has
a
dash
of
sweetness
d
drinkable
but
not
that
fun
to
drink
too
low
in
body
makes
me
feel
like
im
drinking
water
or
budweiser
overall
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
and
will
have
this
again
this
beer
just
feels
so
good
with
a
creamy
texture
and
inoffensive
carbonation
the
hop
is
the
highlight
of
the
beer
but
the
bitterness
is
kept
in
check
an
amazing
beer
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
d
a
really
good
apa
and
a
decent
value
with
a
bright
spicy
hops
flavor
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
pale
clear
amber
with
a
stciky
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
and
pine
the
taste
follows
more
heavy
on
pine
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
lingers
the
brew
is
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
and
oh
so
drinkable
the
beer
has
the
aroma
of
a
dipa
and
it
taste
like
a
bigger
beer
imo
a
real
good
harvest
style
beer
mini
growler
pour
from
deciccos
in
ardsley
ny
pours
glowing
golden
lighter
amber
clear
in
the
glass
under
a
frothy
off
white
nose
that
stays
around
and
leaves
a
thick
collar
and
copious
spotted
lace
bright
citrus
nose
highlighted
by
notes
of
oranges
nice
looking
and
smelling
brew
healthily
hopped
with
citrus
infused
hops
flavorful
and
quite
tasty
ale
bright
hop
notes
supported
and
balanced
by
a
more
then
ample
malt
under
caraige
more
high
quality
and
well
worth
trying

dense
white

lasting
retention
sits
on
a
glodan
beer
with
great
clarity
plenty
of
fresh
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
nice
soft
aroma
very
balanced
between
light
citrusy
hops
and
a
nose
full
of
caramel
and
toasty
grain
more
of
the
same
in
the
flavor
citrus
hops
some
pine
flavor
and
a
very
nice
light
malt
backing
medium
bodied
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
hitting
me
just
right
at
the
moment
it
is
delicious
i
could
drink
this
all
day
great
job
i
normally
prefer
a
heavier
mouthfeel
but
this
light
mouthfeel
suits
me
just
fine
drinkability
is
as
good
as
it
gets
ive
had
2
six
packs
and
a
few
bar
pints
of
this
in
the
past
month
which
is
probably
more
of
any
single
beer
in
a
month
period
than
any
other
beer
over
the
past
10
years
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
expected
it
to
be
id
like
a
little
more
out
of
my
beer
on
a
chilly
fall
evening
pervasive
hop
taste
throughout
mixed
with
mild
sweetness
bitterness
lingers
long
after
the
finish
modestly
carbonated
in
the
mouth
taste
is
good
but
the
close
if
difficult
making
this
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
other
esbs
out
there
for
example
a
red
hook
but
a
well
made
beer
overall
a
great
refreshing
session
beer
not
overly
complicated
but
well
done
d
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
this
drinks
really
nicely
i
am
beginning
to
notice
that
i
enjoy
southern
tiers
more
basic
offerings
over
their
imperial
series
its
a
decent
beer
but
with
less
of
a
malt
backbone
than
i
like
in
an
esb
if
southern
tier
wants
us
to
understand
one
thing
about
themselves
its
that
they
can
brew
fantastic
beers
tremendously
well
apart
from
a
couple
lackluster
offerings
in
their
yearround
lineup
which
is
to
be
expected
this
brewery
is
responsible
for
a
number
of
my
favourite
stouts
and
hop
bombs
if
they
keep
slugging
out
more
of
these
firstrate
ales
im
going
to
be
needing
more
fingers
and
maybe
toes
to
count
all
of
my
favourites
on
d
a
much
lighter
beer
than
i
was
expecting
i
am
even
more
surprised
to
see
this
one
listed
as
an
esb
given
how
light
it
is
never
the
less
for
being
on
the
lighter
side
this
beer
does
have
a
good
bit
of
flavor
but
is
not
overly
aggressive
an
easy
drinker
and
a
good
session
beer
very
tasty
for
a
lighter
ale
i
was
expecting
a
more
spicy
taste
like
the
other
fall
styles
a
pleasant
hoppy
ale
for
autumn
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
upfront
finishes
crisp
and
tingly
tasty
beer
pretty
drinkable
not
quite
on
the
style
i
had
to
go
back
and
change
everything
about
this
review
i
dont
know
why
i
didnt
like
this
one
the
first
time
around
bad
bottle
bad
timing
bad
food
pairing
who
knows
i
loved
this
beer
tonight
and
i
really
enjoy
esbs
in
general
as
a
foodsession
beer
this
is
a
winner
for
sure
drinkable
flavor
profiles
balance
well
mouthfeel
is
good
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
ale
i
was
very
impressed
at
first
but
found
that
as
it
continued
to
warm
some
weird
flavors
came
out
the
cookietasting
malts
however
the
hops
are
more
bold
in
their
presence
than
their
malt
counterparts
good
beer
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
very
nice
for
the
style
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
cold
fall
day
certainly
worth
a
try
certainly
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
would
make
a
perfect
beer
to
sip
on
while
sitting
outside
and
watching
the
leaves
fall
and
with
the
hot
georgia
summer
lingering
well
into
autumn
it
is
a
great
thirstquencher
as
well
a
great
beer
to
straddle
the
seasons
d
this
is
one
flavorful
harvest
ale
especially
fresh
on
tap
it
also
produced
some
tasty
hop
burps
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
for
sure
cheers
drinkability
great
drinkability
thanks
to
the
5
7
percent
abv
moderate
abv
and
good
taste
makes
this
brew
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodiedvery
easy
drinking
really
nice
fall
release
that
strays
from
the
pumpkin
aleoktoberfest
norm
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
wispy
pure
white
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
nice
juicy
hops
nice
citrus
profile
very
fresh
aroma
pretty
much
all
hops
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
good
grapefruit
citrus
hop
flavor
some
lemon
and
pine
and
a
barely
noticable
malt
body
however
it
does
a
good
job
balancing
out
the
hops
the
brew
has
a
moderate
feel
tingly
carbonation
and
only
finishes
slightly
bitter
which
is
surprising
considering
all
of
the
hop
flavor
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
probably
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
but
it
works
well
recommended
this
beer
is
a
little
one
noted
for
my
taste
it
lacks
some
complexity
it
would
make
for
a
very
nice
session
beer
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
in
one
word
it
would
be
bright
that
may
make
you
think
it
is
light
on
flavor
but
that
would
be
far
from
the
truth
this
will
sound
silly
but
the
mouthfeel
on
this
just
makes
you
happy
there
are
strong
hop
flavors
but
they
are
balanced
out
by
a
crisp
clean
flavor
that
makes
this
a
superior
beer
once
you
drink
it
you
will
know
exactly
what
i
mean
try
it
for
sure
edit
upon
reading
others
reviews
i
must
say
im
a
bit
confused
but
i
stick
to
my
review
its
the
last
of
a
sixer
and
all
have
tasted
the
same
so
no
paletteproblems
on
this
one
ill
have
to
check
this
out
again
sometime
to
see
if
its
the
batch
or
if
my
taste
buds
really
are
that
different
from
others
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
is
super
citrusy
hoppy
it
is
slightly
cloudy
it
has
a
great
hop
aroma
it
has
a
nice
2
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
it
is
nice
and
sweet
to
balance
the
hoppy
overtones
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
for
any
hop
head
it
focuses
on
my
favorite
aspect
of
the
hopflavor
and
aroma
if
you
come
across
this
beer
pick
it
up
taste
in
spite
of
what
you
saw
and
smelled
this
beer
has
an
awesome
balance
its
wicked
hoppy
but
not
over
the
top
i
want
to
make
this
a
damn
nice
beer
from
southern
tier
but
its
sure
an
interesting
take
on
an
esb
styles
be
damned
though
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
worth
trying
for
sure
drinkability
really
high
ive
been
looking
for
a
good
esb
to
replace
a
discontinued
favorite
and
this
one
could
be
a
decent
standin
it
is
bright
refreshing
and
flavorfully
balanced
i
really
enjoy
southern
tiers
seasonals
and
this
is
great
transition
from
hop
sun
in
the
summer
to
the
fall
i
would
100
recommend
this
to
anyone
even
nonhopheads
i
think
my
first
words
were
oh
man
thats
good
this
is
one
crazy
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
have
three
without
blinking
i
have
no
idea
where
they
get
off
classifying
it
as
an
esb
because
its
nothing
like
any
esb
ive
ever
had
its
more
like
a
pale
ale
or
even
ipa
the
hops
are
so
floral
and
citrusy
a
nice
hint
of
clementine
but
theres
also
this
sweetness
that
is
what
makes
it
so
drinkable
it
is
in
no
way
overpowering
but
its
what
makes
it
a
bit
harder
to
categorize
im
not
sure
if
they
changed
the
recipe
from
last
year
but
judging
by
the
comments
it
seems
a
lot
of
people
like
this
seasons
batch
dwithout
a
doubt
my
most
favorite
harvest
ale
out
there
fairly
low
abv
and
that
sharp
citrus
hop
zing
that
i
love
there
must
be
amarillo
hops
in
here
my
number
one
hop
variety
simply
outstanding
and
a
brew
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
every
fall
d
pretty
good
one
of
the
easiertodrink
bitters
out
there
this
isnt
too
bad
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
oktoberfests
that
dominate
the
fall
scene
its
a
solid
esb
although
its
somewhat
unique
for
that
style
as
well
not
a
bad
brew
worth
picking
up
excellent
fall
beer
never
had
a
esb
quite
like
this
one
taste
like
amarillo
hopswhich
i
love
mixed
with
the
taste
of
fall
this
is
my
favorite
fall
beer
better
than
any
pumpkin
or
oktoberfest
for
my
taste
dont
expect
a
esb
when
you
try
it
nothing
like
an
esb
i
have
tasted
much
better
drinkability
moderately
high
the
bitterness
is
nice
and
its
fairly
refreshing
the
abv
doesnt
feel
too
high
and
this
would
be
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
yummmooo
wow
great
beer
poured
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
thick
white
head
and
good
lace
color
is
18
k
yellow
gold
aroma
is
very
fresh
citrus
hop
flavor
is
super
fresh
hop
but
not
so
citrus
more
earthy
chewy
hop
some
malt
and
bread
body
is
good
a
little
soft
carbonation
is
good
finish
is
excellent
satisfying
yet
leaves
me
with
a
yearning
for
more
and
more
and
thank
you
southern
tier
drinkability
i
found
myself
liking
this
beer
more
and
more
after
the
initial
shock
of
the
hops
i
do
like
the
hoppiness
and
the
slight
fruit
taste
i
could
have
two
or
so
but
certainly
not
a
six
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
harvest
is
fresh
and
clean
on
the
whole
and
a
beer
ill
gladly
pick
up
again
drinkability
is
outstanding
i
will
be
going
back
to
the
store
for
more
d
i
could
definitley
have
a
few
of
these
nice
and
refreshing
for
what
it
is
most
definitely
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
another
stellar
beer
from
the
st
cheers
first
with
a
name
like
harvest
ale
you
are
expecting
some
type
of
oktoberfest
which
this
is
not
however
what
you
will
get
is
a
really
nice
pale
ale
very
hoppy
and
smooth
a
great
hop
bite
with
a
nice
bitter
spicy
finish
just
another
fine
offering
from
southern
tier
d
its
hard
not
to
want
to
gulp
this
beer
down
it
is
refreshing
hoppy
and
quite
delicious
im
glad
i
bought
a
6er
but
it
definitely
wont
last
long
nice
hoppy
beer
to
enjoy
as
the
days
become
cooler
ill
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
next
year
a
harvest
ale
should
be
bready
and
complex
howerver
southern
tiers
is
pale
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
was
told
by
the
bartender
that
it
was
a
wheat
ale
but
i
assumed
by
the
name
harvest
that
it
was
a
fresh
hop
pale
ale
although
this
is
called
an
esb
this
is
really
like
a
pale
ale
great
hop
aroma
great
bitterness
and
all
around
very
good
beer
a
nice
change
from
a
brewery
with
so
many
extreme
beers
md
light
to
medium
bodied
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
something
different
than
an
apa
d
verydrinkable
and
a
nice
change
compared
to
most
other
fall
seasonals
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
it
is
which
isnt
much
of
an
esb
more
like
a
light
ipa
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
nice
for
watching
the
bills
kick
some
ass
this
year
harvest
this
is
my
favorite
time
of
year
the
northeast
weather
is
starting
to
cool
leaves
gaining
the
fall
colors
football
season
about
to
begin
and
southern
tier
releases
the
harvest
ale
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
a
light
golden
color
that
surprisingly
sits
a
bit
heavy
in
mouthfeel
the
floral
hops
create
an
amazing
smell
which
complements
this
brews
extraordinary
taste
you
cant
just
enjoy
one
as
each
after
the
first
just
exponentially
get
better
this
brew
awakens
taste
buds
that
have
laid
dorment
since
last
falls
harvest
the
only
thing
better
than
enjoying
a
harvest
is
enjoying
it
off
a
tap
with
friends
cheers
dthis
is
a
quite
drinkable
effort
from
southern
tier
and
probably
the
best
beer
that
i
have
had
from
them
there
is
not
much
that
says
autumn
here
for
me
but
a
solid
beer
to
enjoy
any
time
a
bright
golden
orange
pour
with
a
lasting
foamy
white
head
lost
of
lacing
left
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
citrus
zest
and
light
floral
notes
with
a
hint
of
pine
flavor
of
light
toasted
caramel
malt
orange
and
citrus
with
some
piny
resin
nice
level
of
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
clean
mouthfeel
nice
hoppy
finish
very
good
and
sessionable
a
very
good
brew
from
southern
tier
had
a
rich
golden
apperance
some
what
standard
had
a
very
unique
smell
to
my
nose
reminds
me
of
mango
sherbert
it
had
a
very
complex
taste
with
a
multitude
of
flavors
sweet
bitter
fruity
were
the
main
tastes
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
was
a
solid
beer
would
drink
again
mouth
is
crisp
and
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
slight
oily
finish
drinksincredibly
easy
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
is
suprising
4
5
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
put
down
i
probably
should
have
given
a
bigger
penalty
for
the
lack
of
body
but
this
is
so
damn
drinkable
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
drinkable
sessionable
overall
a
good
brew
nice
to
see
another
good
interpretation
of
the
style
d
oh
so
drinkable
i
am
astounded
by
the
big
aromas
and
flavors
packed
into
such
a
lowalcohol
beer
i
picked
up
two
6packs
of
this
in
columbus
9
99
each
first
off
it
must
be
said
that
this
is
not
an
esb
the
style
currently
entered
on
ba
this
strikes
me
as
an
apa
or
something
of
that
ilk
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
golden
colored
with
a
thin
1finger
head
that
laces
onto
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
amarillo
hops
at
least
as
far
as
i
can
tell
based
on
smell
alone
i
dont
think
i
could
distinguish
this
from
gumballhead
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
im
getting
lots
of
citrus
like
grapefruit
orange
and
maybe
some
noncitrus
mango
the
taste
is
nearly
equal
to
the
smell
and
again
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
gumballhead
lots
of
sweetness
from
the
hops
and
abundant
malt
based
on
mouthfeel
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
seems
to
come
from
the
hops
again
the
body
is
on
the
thicker
side
for
such
a
light
looking
and
smelling
beer
this
is
a
big
winner
from
southern
tier
definitely
worth
a
repeat
oh
its
an
esb
regardless
it
poured
a
golden
straw
color
lighter
than
i
expected
with
the
modest
white
head
it
looks
like
a
pils
plenty
of
citruspine
hops
and
stone
fruits
in
the
aroma
same
goes
for
the
flavor
with
earthy
hops
dominating
malts
give
it
balance
and
there
is
a
touch
of
banana
with
a
medium
body
and
oily
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
way
to
ease
into
fall
as
this
one
reminded
me
of
my
favorite
summer
apas
im
always
glad
to
see
this
one
on
the
shelves
get
it
while
its
available
super
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
hop
scent
that
balances
the
malt
aroma
nicely
it
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
bisquit
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
bitter
and
earthy
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
and
bisquity
it
has
a
nice
breadlike
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
really
good
seasonal
ive
heard
of
it
mentioned
the
last
couple
of
years
but
could
never
get
any
this
is
a
fine
drinker
d
smooth
refreshing
d
i
could
easily
session
with
this
one
i
dont
think
esb
is
an
appropriate
title
for
this
beer
but
i
cant
think
of
anything
else
this
is
a
really
great
beer
all
around
id
love
to
find
more
of
this
thanks
john
fantastic
sessionability
light
but
delicious
pours
a
pale
seethru
gold
body
that
is
gives
off
a
little
head
that
dies
quickly
a
mild
fruit
aroma
of
apple
and
pear
along
with
some
citric
tealike
hop
notes
smooth
and
mediumbodied
with
fruit
notes
ranging
from
pear
to
citric
orange
banana
lightly
contains
some
graininess
and
sweet
malt
sensations
that
are
balanced
for
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
as
it
passes
the
tongue
and
contains
a
grat
prickly
dry
backbite
i
must
say
that
this
didnt
remind
me
of
an
esb
at
all
as
the
hops
are
much
more
dominant
than
anything
else
a
mislabeled
ipa
still
another
good
beer
from
southern
tier
taste
is
primarily
bitter
with
some
orange
flavor
and
a
fair
amount
of
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
despite
the
bitterness
due
to
the
moderately
high
carbonation

easily
sessionable
a
breeze
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
quenching
with
a
dry
finish
malt
and
hops
are
balanced
but
this
is
way
off
its
supposed
style
i
will
revisit
this
one
a
very
american
interpreatation
of
an
esb
id
call
this
an
ipa
for
sure
pours
a
radiant
burnished
gold
with
a
large
sticky
white
head
that
laced
prodigiously
stunning
looks
huge
hoppy
aroma
all
sorts
of
citrus
in
abundance
the
flavour
revelaed
much
of
the
same
lots
of
citrus
going
on
and
lending
an
impressive
bitterness
some
solid
malts
to
back
it
up
and
balance
everything
sticky
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
this
is
another
excellent
offering
from
southern
tier
and
sure
to
satisfy
all
you
hopheads
thanks
for
sharing
shawn
do
this
has
sts
distinctive
hop
presence
cranked
up
a
notch
or
two
though
not
overly
so
drinkability
is
high
if
youre
a
hophead
and
even
if
youre
not
theres
plenty
to
appreciate
in
this
brew
i
struggle
with
reviewing
this
as
an
esb
though
as
the
malt
backbone
or
lack
thereof
really
remind
me
more
of
an
american
pale
ale
the
hops
are
there
as
you
would
expect
but
i
think
a
bit
more
malt
character
would
make
them
really
stand
out
in
the
taste
like
the
do
on
the
nose
overall
this
was
a
very
very
good
beer
rich
and
loaded
with
hoppy
goodness
easy
to
session
and
a
joy
to
drink
i
will
most
certainly
have
this
one
again
d
i
really
like
this
beer
i
could
session
this
one
all
day
long
with
ease
this
is
my
introduction
to
southern
tier
and
i
hope
the
other
5
styles
i
have
in
the
fridge
will
be
just
as
good
d
pretty
decent
and
enjoyable
even
though
its
freezing
outside
right
now
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
this
time
of
the
year
i
could
easily
see
myself
downing
a
few
of
these
in
a
given
night
and
there
arent
any
spices
or
terribly
complex
flavors
to
interrupt
things
here
this
does
remind
me
of
the
hop
sun
in
more
than
one
way
but
nevertheless
this
is
a
fine
brew
to
grab
when
transitioning
from
the
fall
into
the
winter
i
only
wish
it
was
a
bit
darker
and
fuller
a
nicely
refreshing
take
on
the
esb
doesnt
seem
very
authentic
at
least
compared
to
fullers
but
a
good
beer
nevertheless

very
good
beer
just
slightly
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
hops
in
the
taste
excellent
job
southern
tier
d
not
bad
but
not
very
exciting
either
simple
and
easy
enough
to
drink
though
this
was
an
easy
drinking
and
affordable
southern
tier
hoppy
ale
it
wasnt
overly
hopped
up
but
it
was
getting
there
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
southern
tier
beer
again
mediumtofull
body
easy
to
drink
glad
to
have
these
at
the
local
beer
store
i
dont
think
of
a
harvest
ale
being
an
esb
but
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
also
sessionable
sometimes
average
is
good
and
sometimes
one
expects
more
for
the
stylebrewery
decentbut
better
finds
in
this
style
are
available
fullers
esb
md
i
really
enjoy
this
one
and
could
get
myself
into
trouble
drinking
many
of
these
in
a
night
notes
i
wasnt
expecting
a
esb
for
a
harvest
beer
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
another
very
fine
brew
from
southern
tier
once
again
for
a
harvest
ale
this
beer
seems
to
be
just
too
light
there
is
a
very
smooth
and
flowing
mouth
feel
to
the
beer
that
holds
true
throughout
the
high
level
of
carbonation
upon
the
pour
carries
its
way
throughout
the
offering
and
perhaps
if
the
carbonation
was
toned
down
a
bit
this
beer
would
have
been
a
bit
better
of
a
story
to
tell
drinkability
a
perfectly
decent
and
drinkable
harvest
ale
with
a
surprisingly
low
level
of
alcohol
a
good
array
of
fresh
oily
hop
notes
a
pleasant
aroma
and
mouthfeel
yep
not
southern
tiers
best
but
definitely
a
good
beer
a
pale
yellow
almost
the
color
of
a
light
honey
thin
layer
of
foam
across
the
beer
3

s
some
very
earthy
and
musty
aromas
which
i
can
assume
are
largely
the
result
of
the
fresh
hops
used
for
dry
hopping
quite
citrusy
possibly
some
grapefruit
and
pineapple

t
a
touch
more
bitterness
than
id
expect
from
an
esb
grapefruit
nice
balance
of
caramel
and
malt
the
back
of
the
tongue
really
jumps
alive
which
again
points
to
the

d
if
i
wasnt
going
to
grab
an
ipa
and
wanted
to
take
in
some
hops
this
may
well
be
the
beer
id
grab
4

i
gave
this
all
3s
because
this
really
wasnt
an
esb
in
my
humble
opinion
perhaps
i
am
wrong
but
based
on
the
other
15
or
so
examples
of
esb
i
have
had
this
one
is
nowhere
close
to
the
others
too
light
in
color
lots
of
fresh
hop
aroma
light
bitterness
light
body
if
this
were
an
apa
i
would
give
around
4

but
with
style
in
consideration
i
dont
think
this
fits
at
all
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
apricot
and
orange
hops
with
light
yeast
and
a
bit
of
malt
it
tasted
like
bittersweet
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
honey
malt
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
an
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
pretty
good
clean
flavor
and
nice
body
it
was
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
octoberfest
and
there
wasnt
anything
terribly
unique
about
it
but
it
was
still
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable

very
nice

i
really
like
this

very

d
a

taste
combination
makes
this
beer
pretty
easy
going
down
the
lacing
is
nice
and
the
flavor
of
the
beer
seems
to
come
out
more
as
you
drink
it
a
decent
brew
definitely
worth
a
go
poured
into
my
blue
point
shaker
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
thick
white
foam
aroma
is
dominated
by
fresh
hops
with
lightly
toasted
grains
present
as
well
very
nice
tastes
of
bitter
piney
hops
citrus
fruits
such
as
lemon
and
mild
bready
grains
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
body
is
fuller
than
the
color
of
this
beer
would
lead
you
to
believe
finish
is
crisp
and
slightly
dry
with
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
a
very
well
done
beer
that
has
session
written
all
over
it
dont
pass
this
one
by
highly
sessionable
for
me
try
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
thick
in
the
mouth
all
adding
to
the
experience
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
im
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
it
bottom
line
yum
i
had
my
doubts
when
i
took
my
first
whiff
but
my
first
taste
told
me
that
this
is
a
well
crafted
esb
look
my
glass
is
empty
already
bummer
pours
a
slightly
orangeish
gold
with
a
medium
sized
sudsy
head
that
dies
back
fairly
quickly
aromas
are
fairly
crisp
pine
and
citrus
but
they
are
kind
of
subdued
while
those
hops
dominate
the
nose
and
would
make
you
think
you
were
headed
down
the
ipa
path
flavor
is
more
consistent
with
an
english
esb
kind
of
a
sweet
honey
and
bread
malt
body
with
a
bitter
hops
to
hold
it
in
check
it
stays
nice
and
crisp
throughout
and
is
pleasant
enough
i
was
surprised
when
i
poured
this
beer
out
because
i
was
expecting
some
sort
of
oktoberfest
or
something
really
malty
instead
i
got
a
really
nicely
yellow
beer
with
some
fragrant
white
head
that
dies
down
quickly
i
definitely
like
the
color
for
this
style
a
lot
more
pilsnerlike
but
with
a
slightly
unique
touch
of
amber
too
it
smells
hoppy
like
a
west
coast
ipa
with
good
balance
the
taste
is
rich
and
hoppy
but
well
balanced
by
the
malt
grassy
hops
that
finish
very
clean
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
overly
bitter
beers
but
this
is
so
clean
and
full
of
flavor
a
little
watery
towards
the
finish
id
like
some
more
malt
there
to
really
get
the
full
experience
mouthfeel
is
a
perfect
balance
of
carbonation
on
a
medium
body
i
want
some
more
just
keep
me
away
from
that
spicy
pumpkin
flavored
shit
people
call
beer
happy
birthday
hyland
i
bet
its
good
with
chinese
delivery
food
hammer
the
beer
poured
a
clear
honeyamber
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
of
fresh
piney
hops
so
far
so
good
for
an
esb
the
taste
was
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
sweetness
hop
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
with
a
snack
or
while
sitting
back
relaxing
i
wouldnt
drink
this
with
dinner
but
maybe
beforehand
to
get
my
taste
buds
rocking
not
my
favorite
esb
but
not
the
worst
ive
had
either
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
and
more
drinkable
side
with
a
really
nice
creaminess
that
goes
all
the
way
through
each
sip
overall
a
refreshing
brew
with
a
nice
hoppy
bite
that
goes
down
easy
i
could
see
a
six
pack
of
this
going
very
well
with
a
crisp
fall
evening
thanks
to
afterexile
for
the
chance
to
sample
this
one
pours
an
unimpressive
yellow
color
with
a
good
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
the
appearance
is
easily
the
weakest
point
the
aroma
is
heavily
of
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
dominated
by
hops
with
a
great
bitterness
to
it
pretty
good
beer
definitely
happy
i
was
able
to
try
it
drinkability
very
nice
beer
on
the
hoppybitter
side
but
has
a
wonderful
citrus
smell
and
graoefruit
taste
i
liked
it
and
would
drink
it
again
a
fall
seasonal
beer
thats
more
or
less
a
tweaked
ipa
and
not
a
spectacular
one
at
that
id
be
reluctant
to
get
this
one
again
just
because
there
are
far
better
yearround
ipas
available
out
there
southern
tiers
crafted
a
rather
unique
harvest
ale
its
not
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
a
release
this
time
of
year
i
question
the
style
classification
here
this
is
much
more
of
an
apa
than
an
esb
in
any
event
its
a
really
good
beer
thats
worth
checking
out
mfd
good
carbonation
and
a
slick
oily
mouthfeel
although
i
would
hardly
consider
this
ale
an
esb
i
really
enjoyed
it
reminded
me
a
litte
of
nugget
nectar
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
better
hoppy
beers
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
d
overall
a
light
bodied
but
heavily
hopped
beer
that
be
limited
in
multiples
unless
you
are
a
major
hophead
liked
it
but
not
one
i
would
consider
session
material
drinkability
seemed
almost
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
an
esb
but
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
as
the
freshness
of
the
hops
are
pretty
striking
southern
tiers
climbing
their
way
out
of
a
hole
theyd
dug
for
me
after
the
last
few
brews
ive
had
from
them
this
drinks
like
a
lighter
ipa
powerful
and
fulfilling
yet
extremely
clean
awesome
stuff
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
was
left
with
an
almost
aspiriny
bitterness
without
much
else
the
flavor
started
out
fine
but
slipped
to
almost
soapish
and
aspiriny
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
dont
know
if
i
would
say
it
makes
me
think
of
oktoberfest
but
thats
quite
alright
a
very
tasty
brew
that
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
of
one
very
drinkable
beer
their
is
a
nice
creaminess
to
this
beer
with
moderate
carbonation
that
helps
makes
this
beer
a
decent
session
beer
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
style
but
this
is
a
nice
esb
d
what
a
nice
surprise
the
listed
style
of
esb
had
me
expecting
one
thing
and
this
delivered
something
completely
different
i
like
surprises
drinkability
is
great
at
the
begining
of
this
ale
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavours
lack
and
become
even
more
unbalanced
overall
a
fine
harvest
ale
to
drink
on
any
given
day
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
sharp
of
medium
build
as
noted
above
the
feel
does
seem
to
thin
out
midway
through
makes
for
an
enjoyable
and
very
quaffable
beer

a
very
clear

remain
on

and
a
moderate

a
very
nice
fall
brew
from
southern
tier
that
displays
very
fresh
ingredients
from
the
recent
harvest
unfortunately
this
one
sample
beer
i
was
provided
with
is
the
last
of
it
breed
at
the
bottle
shop
seek
out
very
nice
this
is
a
damn
solid
beer
one
of
the
best
nonimperial
offerings
ive
had
from
st
a
golden
brew
whose
light
color
took
me
by
surprise
as
i
had
expected
something
amberorangeish
thin
white
head
but
with
decent
structure
and
lace
there
is
a
distinct
yet
mild
hop
aroma
a
bit
citrusy
and
a
bit
tealike
by
turns
i
also
catch
a
faint
and
pleasant
whiff
of
autumn
leaves
perhaps
just
a
fancy
the
flavors
are
much
the
same
with
a
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
and
lighttomedium
body
this
beer
has
october
written
all
over
it
september
if
you
live
up
north
great
stuff
recommended
edit
from
9712
tried
again
and
was
reminded
quite
vividly
that
this
beer
differs
from
year
to
year
the
current
version
is
decent
but
pales
in
comparison
to
the
beer
i
sampled
back
in
2008
unfortunately
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
hue
with
some
small
yet
steady
bubble
very
faint
foam
that
sticks
around
for
just
a
little
bit
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
herbal
and
citrus
hops
and
some
toasted
caramel
breads
the
taste
starts
with
lots
of
orange
zest
that
slowly
gives
way
to
soft
english
caramels
and
toffee
just
o
be
overtaken
by
the
herbal
and
orange
hoppy
finish
the
start
is
hoppy
then
mixes
a
little
with
the
malt
bill
then
finishes
hoppy
again
the
hops
are
a
little
too
bright
almost
metallic
tasting
but
still
a
nice
amrican
version
of
an
esb
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
glass
color
was
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
white
one
finger
head
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
but
yet
bitter
sometimes
i
could
smell
creamy
or
vanilla
and
sometimes
a
bit
of
berry
fruit
but
usually
bitterness
taste
was
bitter
reminded
me
of
pine
but
not
over
poweringly
so
felt
reasonably
good
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
and
not
excess
carbonation
to
deal
with
very
easy
to
drink
could
do
a
few
in
a
sitting
i
should
have
bought
a
case
of
this
when
i
was
at
the
brewery
d
a
nice
hoppy
brew
and
enjoyable
to

abv
fantastic
drinkability
here
im
picking
up
a
case
of
this
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
youd
want
to
drink
outside
leaves
burning
with
the
hot
and
sticky
summer
just
a
distant
memory
love
this
d
this
beer
is
great
tons
of
taste
and
low
abv
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
want
to
have
a
keg
of
really
well
done
by
southern
tier
i
know
they
have
a
reputation
for
their
big
beers
but
this
one
is
worth
trying
hazy
deep
golden
yellow
color
the
aroma
is
something
i
wouldnt
normally
expect
from
a
beer
dubbed
harvest
ale
it
is
very
hop
forward
true
to
style
it
is
not
but
i
love
the
nose
on
this
beer
some
mild
spice
is
hidden
beneath
the
hop
characteristics
a
huge
hop
pungency
hits
at
the
onset
of
the
taste
followed
by
a
very
smooth
malt
sweetness
across
the
middle
the
hops
finish
on
the
tail
end
with
the
bitterness
some
good
spice
characteristics
are
also
mixed
subtly
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
an
easy
drinkability
and
it
feels
like
it
would
fill
me
up
after
a
few
of
them
i
have
to
say
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
others
i
would
describe
it
as
medium
hoped
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
md
light
body
high
amount
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
tingley
mouthfeel
5
2
abv
and
the
light
nature
of
the
beer
make
for
a
good
drinkability
overall
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
out
in
the
yard
but
just
ok
for
the
style
skal
straw
colored
with
a
nice
think
head
that
just
floats
on
top
with
ring
around
the
glass
that
firmly
hangs
on
smells
fruity
apple
pineapple
orange
papaya
with
a
hint
of
pine
grapefruit
citrusy
and
very
smooth
theres
some
kind
of
malty
sweetness
that
gives
it
a
nice
wellrounded
body
some
nice
bitterness
that
lingers
momentarily
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
much
more
bitter
surprisingly
flavorful
and
hoppy
for
the
light
color
proof
that
you
cant
judge
a
beer
by
its
appearance
pours
yellowish
gold
with
a
lasting
white
head
lighter
than
expected
and
looks
much
like
a
lager
smell
is
grassy
earthy
hoppiness
and
mildly
so
taste
is
somewhat
mild
and
not
very
green
or
spicy
like
i
like
fresh
hop
beers
melon
and
tea
flavored
hops
mostly
with
some
earthiness
and
mild
bitterness
a
bit
watery
and
muted
flavorwise
but
this
is
very
drinkable
with
no
offensive
qualities
decent
pale
the
hops
are
piney
and
citrusy
and
go
very
well
will
the
light
esb
features
of
this
beer
a
great
beer
overall
to
bad
it
is
a
seasonal
thing
nice
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
decent
starkwhite
head
flowery
hop
aromas
and
then
a
floral
taste
as
well
some
maltiness
in
the
back
bitterness
nice
beer
i
wouldnt
have
suspected
this
is
an
esb
thanks
to
vwcraig
for
including
this
on
a
recent
trade
bitter
yes
though
im
not
sure
id
call
this
an
esb
ipa
aspects
as
well
possibly
akin
to
troegs

whatever
st
harvest
ale
made
a
solid
everyday
beer
for
me
between
the
octoberfests
of
sept
and
oct
and
thanksgiving
when
snca
took
over
bottle
courtesy
of
jerc
poured
a
deep
hazy
dirty
yellow
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aromas
of
green
hops
are
dominating
with
some
nice
floral
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
bitter
green
hops
with
some
floral
notes
body
is
full
with
some
limited
filtration
and
great
carbonation
very
well
done
for
the
style
and
something
that
i
wish
was
available
more
readily
around
me
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
that
has
some
staying
power
nose
is
perfumed
floral
hops
in
abundance
but
not
shoving
it
all
down
errr
up
your
nose
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
though
it
is
a
bit
hop
forward
mild
bitter
tone
there
more
than
mild
but
not
overly
pronounced
leafy
character
as
well
feel
has
a
pretty
full
carbonation
to
it
and
a
decent
liquid
body
a
definite
fall
time
brew
even
though
it
is
still
summer
weather
i
drink
this
on
and
feel
like
fall
is
almost
on
me
another
good
one
by
st
i
have
a
feeling
this
one
might
not
age
or
travel
well
but
here
in
upstate
ny
it
tastes
really
good
overallan
apa
that
drinks
like
a
little
america
ipa
fantastic
freah
hops
throughout
top
nothc
brew
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
that
are
hoppy
with
a
small
grapefruity
presence
in
the
taste
a
fresh
hop
taste
and
a
nice
malty
backing
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
nice
fresh
hop
yet
looks
like
a
pilsner
a
good
crossover
from
summer
to
fall
light
body
carbonation
seems
low
pretty
tame
at
both
ends
not
as
juicy
as
i
was
expecting
worth
trying
d
excellent
i
find
it
difficult
to
put
the
glass
down
a
thirst
quencher
that
doubles
up
as
a
sipper
depending
on
what
you
are
in
the
mood
for
i
got
about
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
from
the
pour
the
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
the
nose
was
spicy
and
citrusy
specifically
cinnamon
and
orange
zest
and
i
was
put
in
mind
of
potpourri
plus
my
mouth
started
watering
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
full
and
i
got
a
really
tangy
orange
flavor
in
the
mouth
the
finish
was
more
piney
and
lingeringly
hoppy
shazam
boy
was
this
a
good
beer
i
really
recommend
it
excellent
drinkability
just
sharp
enough
to
make
this
beer
refreshing
and
fulfilling
at
the
same
time
could
easily
work
through
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
2
finger
white
head
and
some
of
that
lacing
really
sticks
around
smell
is
of
amazing
hops
and
sweet
citrus
taste
is
of
a
crisp
hop
juice
i
really
liked
this
one
overall
a
total
session
beer
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasant
flavor
tasty
stuff
definitely
recommended
highly
unique
but
not
in
a
challenging
way

however
and
it
reminded
me
in
many
ways
of
a
pilsner
not
sure
whether
thats
a
german
or
czech
pilsner
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
could
make
a
great
fall
session
beer
for
hopheads
another
success
story
from
southern
tier
edit
i
am
really
noticing
more
of
a
citrus
hop
taste
and
scent
than
the
pine
i
originally
experienced
with
an
earlier
beer
from
the
pack
i
picked
up
also
when
i
first
poured
this
last
beer
i
noticed
a
clear
pineapple
smell
which
was
a
little
difficult
to
pinpoint
i
just
could
not
figure
it
out
not
sure
why
i
am
picking
up
the
different
flavors
and
scents
now
still
a
very
interesting
brew
in
my
book
drinkability
a
tasty
ale
a
little
much
for
extended
sessions
but
worth
a
sixer
dont
put
too
much
emphasis

the

of

a

these

are

i
could

a
very
pleasing
esb
which
hits
all
the
characteristics
dont
know
if
this
ever
won
any
gabf
awards
but
it
should
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
rave
about
bit
too
bland
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
persistent
foamy
head
and
some
nice

nose
is
nutty
and
buttery
with
some

light
and
bready
with
a
slightly
bitter

balanced
with
a
slight

a
little
shallow
and
bland
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
this
is
a
very
sessionable
esb
malty
and
not
terribly
better
i
would
have
given
it
higher
marks
for
a
more
fruity
or
nutty
taste
than
for
the
soapy
taste
in
the
middle
overall
not
bad
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
get
this
again
caramel
and
bready
malt
character
with
earthy
and
floral
hop
character
a
good
start
for
any
beer
but
this
just
seems
to
be
somewhat
poorly
executed
overall
a
straight
and
narrow
ale
despite
the
esb
moniker
this
beer
is
not
bitter
at
all
malty
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
towards
the
end
fruity
aromas
dont
make
their
way
into
the
taste
of
the
beer
i
consider
this
a
wonderful
session
brew
worthy
of
more
than
one
chestnut

in
color
faint
nose
in
the
std
pint
glass
nice
sweet

with
hops
bringing
up
the
rear
not
many
brewers
do
the
esbstyle
this
is
a
fine
example
worthy
of
your
time
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
think
it
fits
into
the
style
very
well
and
would
recommend
trying
it
to
anyone
who
likes
english
beers
the
only
thing
that
detracts
from
this
beer
for
me
is
the
tannin
taste
and
its
not
over
the
top
at
all
so
i
am
going
to
give
this
beer
a
solid
4
out
of
5
rjt
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddishamber
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
little
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of

the
brew
smells
like

and
some
nuts
and

mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
with

i
think
its
a
solid
beer
its
definitely
worth
a
try
o
average
esb
o
very
bitter
brew
from
stoudts
that
is
drinkable
this
a
decent
esb
but
it
has
a
few
off
notes
the
medicinal
underpinnings
im
not
fond
of
its
also
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
would
have
liked
i
did
the
big
fruity
notes
provided
by
the
yeast
and
i
thought
it
had
a
decent
grain
bill
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
then
you
definitely
have
to
check
it

drinking
though
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
this
aftertaste
oa
decent

just
a
little
too
much
sweetness
for
me
to
want
to
seek
it
out
overall
stoudts
does
beers
like
this
lower

than
most

lots

so
well
its
rare
to
find

this
robust
in
american
beers
that
arent

this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley

othis
is

beer
it
is

for
the

i
know
it
comes
in
bottles
but
wow
a
few
cans
of
this
and
a
fishing
trip
would
be
pure
happiness
the
flavors
arent
unique
or
very
bold
but
they
are
crisp
and
smooth
stoudts
always
seems
to
impress
me
and
this
esb
hits
the
spot
give
er
a
try
overall
its
rather
average
in
my
opinion
i
would
have
it
if
offered
to
me
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
i
poured
this
one
itno
a
pint
glass
it
has
a

color
body
with
not
head
or
lace
the
smell
is
of
toasted
bread
and
a

aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
nuttiness
to
it
and
some
carmel
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
closer
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
well
balanced
and
overall
is
a
good
beer
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
the
flavors
were
a
little
light
but
not
displeasing
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
simple
brew
and
would
be
easy
to
drink
all
day
its
a
decent
but
not
great
example
of
an
esb
but
would
probably
be
better
suited
to
use
in
the
spring
or
fall
as
opposed
to
the
summer
due
to
its
fullness
its
a
little
different
than
a
standard
esb
that
doesnt
mean
better
or
worse
just
a
little
different
than
i
expected
overall
a
pleasing
beer
if
this
was
readily
available
i
would
have
no
problem
with
having
a
few
of
these
but
for
now
its
off
to
more
adventures
in
beer
tasting
pours
a
nice
reddish
copper
amber
color
white
fluffy
head
smells
of
caramel
malts
grassy
and
earthy
hops
bready
taste
i
get
some
citrus
earthy
hops
along
with
sweet
malt
nicely
balanced
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nice
dry
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
esb
this
is
becoming
a
favorite
style
for
myself
o
its
an
average
boring
esb
with
weird
twists
here
and
there
i
love
pa
brews
loved
the
balance
on
this
one
poured
a
nice
copperred
color
into
a
standard
pint
fluffy
white
head
disippated
to
half
inch
foam
soft
aroma
typical
of
esb
with
bready
malt
followed
by
moderate
hops
like
i
mentioned
above
nice
balance
drinkability
was
high
due
to
the
smooth
carbonation
and
light
body
would
seek
out
to
try
on
tap
overall
i
have
had
a
few
esbs
in
my
time
but
this
is
surely
the
driest
one
and
less
sweet
than
all
the
others
still
if
you
like
iced
tea
without
honey
or
sugar
this
dry
esb
could
be
right
up
your
alley
for
me
i
will
stick
to
their
pale
ale
or
lagers
o
this
beer
sort
of
tastes
like
home
brewed
iced
tea
this
is
a
solid
esb
but
is
nothing
special
however
it
is
very
refreshing
and
would
make
for
an
easy
session
ale
moreys
bottom
line
a
good
fall
beer
imo
especially
if
youre
burned
out
on
oktoberfest

12oz

a

some

of

the

sweet

with

balanced
by
some
late
hoppiness
in
the
ending
overall
a
good
drinkable
esb
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
like
all
the
other
stoudts
i
have
had
they
still
dont
stay
true
to
their
styles
this
is
not
a
esb
tasting
at
all
a
good
well
tasting
brew
overall
med
to
light
body
good
drinkability
finishes
clean
maybe
over
carbonate
final
thoughts
a
nice
little
brew
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
head
i
got
and
the
lacing
but
its
not
bad
just
like
a
fine
woman
this
is
a
fine
brew
o
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
flavors
are
pretty
light
and
this
should
be
an
easy
one
for
someone
not
all
that
into
beer
to
enjoy
and
kind
of
broaden
their
horizons
this
beer
is
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
stoudts
thus
far
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
crimson
red
color
with
a
clear
look
to
it
the
head
is
fizzy
and
white
but
leaves
a
pretty
good
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
very
inviting
lots
of
malts
and
a
pretty
good
smelling
hop
aroma
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
with
some
caramel
malts
upfront
that
fade
into
a
much
more
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sharp
on
the
tongue
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
very
good
one
from
stouts
i
havent
had
another
one
since
that
has
even
come
close
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
a
decent
esb
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
amber
color
with
orangecopper
highlights
and
small
bubbly
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
light
aroma
of
biscuity
malts
and
resinous
hops
some
sugar
sweetness
lightly
toasted
bready
malts
in
the
taste
caramel
and
nuts
easygoing
pine
bitterness
and
a
somewhat
acrid
aftertaste
not
really
too
flavorful
but
not
necessarily
bad
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
easily
drinkable
for
a
basic
beer
o
decent
beer
not
bad
but
far
from
spectacular
easy
drinking
light
beer
very
quaffable
because
of
its
tastiness
and
low
alcohol
content
copper
pour
with
reddish
hues
and
a
small
head
aroma
is
quite
malt
forward
with
caramel
and
biscuit
along
with
touches
of
floral
and
perfume
hops
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
malt
continuing
as
the
primary
player
this
strikes
me
as
more
of
an
amber
or
red
ale
as
opposed
to
an
esb
not
bad
but
not
great
either
the
appearance
is
a
rich
amber
with
a
decent
had
and
really
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
caramel
and
a
slight
sweetness
the
taste
is
really
smooth
smell
follows
taste
and
color
not
much
more
to
say
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
amber
esb
very
drinkable
and
tasty
not
an
esb
but
still
decent
nice
simple
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
lot
to
complain
about
worth
a
try
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
cant
compare
this
to
some
of
the
really
good
esbs
propeller
for
example
worth
a
try
for
the
taste
but
not
recommended
for
those
wanting
a
standard
esb
d
decent
not
stellar
will
try
a
fresher
one
not
quite
refreshing
overall
average
beer
o
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
and
id
have
to
say
its
a
below
average
brew
maybe
im
just
missing
something
from
the
style
but
i
wasnt
pleased
with
this
one
nothing
earthshattering
here
i
was
not
too
impressed
by
this
one
esbs
are
supposed
to
be
uber
drinkable
and
yet
still
relatively
complex
i
think
this
one
falls
short
in
both
regards
1
and
done
it
works
but
not
true
to
style
could
not
do
a
6
of
this
didnt
hate
it
but
i
wanted
something
different
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drinknothing
really
interesting
stands
out
in
the
taste
but
its
quite
sessionable
o
a
very
nice
brew
with
good
balance
and
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
for
5
ill
revisit
for
sure
d
very
sessionable
beer
no
presence
of
alcohol
fairly
simple
beer
but
an
easy
drinker
like
i
said
in
the
taste
kind
of
equally
good
bad
aspects
to
this
cant
say
i
love
the
taste
but
overall
the
beers
not
strong
enough
to
make
the
negatives
show
too
brightly
decently
drinkable
goes
down
pretty
smooth
cant
say
id
rush
to
try
it
again
but
id
still
take
it
over
noncraft
alternatives
this
was
my
first
beer
from
stroudts
saw
the
name
on
the
menu
and
i
said
what
the
hell
im
in
johnstown
kickin
it
easy
the
beer
has
a
red
tint
to
it
but
it
could
also
be
the
hugh
from
the
red
mahogany
bar
razor
thin
head
leaves
a
lot
to
be
determined
it
certainly
can
be
session
ale
if
nothing
else
is
available
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
far
superior
to
standard
lite
beers
but
not
your
major
microbrews
hey
an
oxymoron
right
there
these
days
and
especially
in
the
us
esbs
seem
hard
to
come
by
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
those
looking
to
broaden
their
beer
experiencea
flavorful
session
beer
it
tastes
to
me
like
more
of
an
amber
ale
but
very
good
nonetheless
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
it
still
leaves
something
to
be
desired
i
would
drink
this
one
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
d
drinkable
and
tasty
but
the
lower
carbonation
than
desired
is
somewhat
disappointing
a
nice
drinkable
sixer
non
the
less
db
i
usually
enjoy
esbs
and
this
is
no
exception
the
malt
profile
is
multidimensional
and
what
i
find
to
be
most
enjoyable
a
good
example
of
the
style
upon
pouring
with
no
head
i
checked
the
bottle
for
freshness
date
and
none
was
present
smelled
very
herbal
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
tasted
mostly
the
same
flavor
was
rather
bland
herbals
malt
and
a
hint
of
fruity
bitterness
but
not
to
much
as
previously
stated
there
was
no
head
upon
pouring
and
no
lacing
whatsoever
new
to
esbs
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
id
say
this
is
an
ok
session
beer
but
i
felt
that
there
is
too
much
malt
and
too
little
hops
here
for
an
esb
im
inclined
to
believe
scarlet
lady
ale
would
make
a
pretty
enjoyable
offering
when
on
cask
in
the
bottle
however
theres
something
a
little
too
light
too
banal
and
too
plain
about
it
to
warrant
either
recommendation
or
repeat
purchase
ill
be
happy
to
finish
whats
left
though
and
this
offering
notwithstanding
i
still
hold
stoudts
in
good
regard
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
this
beer
is
burnt
orange
in
color
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
some
floral
hops
the
taste
is
some
caramel
malt
with
a
mild
bitter
hops
finish
this
beer
goes
down
real
smooth
it
is
a
great
session
beer
solid
esb
but
trying
this
after
yards
esa
makes
it
pale
in
comparison
good
toasted
malt
and
caramel
flavor
and
the
hops
are
very
subtle
and
mellow
fine
by
me
light
sweetness
with
a
mild
bitterness
and
some
nice
earthy
undertones
carbonation
was
a
little
sharp
for
the
style
no
complaints
but
there
are
better
esbs
from
pa
very
excited
to
try
their
imperial
oatmeal
stout
soon
i
probably
need
to
revisit
this
one
at
some
point
as
it
wasnt
at
all
impressive
dthis
is
a
tasty
brew
nice
balance
and
easy
drinking
pretty
on
point
for
the
style
and
follows
the
standards
d
tasty
and
enjoyable
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
solid
esb
to
be
sure
this
is
highly
drinkable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
stoudts
i
prefer
esbs
with
a
little
more
punch
and
more
of
a
lingering
finish
d
drinkability
is
good
would
not
mind
revisiting
this
brew
again
especially
on
cask
or
when
a
long
period
of
imbibement
is
anticipated
worth
a
taste
for
sure
dthis
is
a
perfect
session
beer
all
the
way
i
would
have
had
another
pint
but
my
friend
didnt
like
it
and
he
wanted
to
split
a
pitcher
however
the
next
time
i
see
this
on
tap
i
will
gladly
enjoy
some
more
pints
the
taste
is
ok
mild
like
the
lady
but
ill
bet
if
you
drank
a
bunch
of
them
she
would
be
talking
to
you
and
it
seems
like
the
taste
would
start
to
sink
in
its
more
of
a
subtle
thing
than
hit
you
up
side
the
head
tasty
single
from
whole
foods
short
pump
glen
allen
va
t
its
very
dry
with
a
lagery
aftertaste
somewhat
sour
but
quality
its
too
dry
for
my
taste
and
the
bitter
is
not
really
there
clear
reddishcopper
pour
with
creamy
quickly
fading
head
and
nice
lacing
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
besides
some
earthy
malt
and
biscuit
toasty
caramel
malts
sweeten
the
taste
but
the
hops
are
pretty
subdued
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
its
fairly
drinkable
but
a
little
sweet
for
an
esb
d
a
winner
from
stoudts
this
is
a
pleasant
drinker
with
surprising
complexity
definitely
flew
in
under
the
radar
d
could
drink
this
all
night
abv
is
low
and
the
taste
is
good
considering
the
bar
im
at
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
no
head
retention
of
lacing
smell
is
of
carmel
malts
some
earthy
hops
and
a
kiss
of
nuts
and
grapes
taste
is
rather
muddy
carmel
nuts
brown
sugar
earthy
hops
light
herbal
touch
and
grapes
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
under
carbonated
pretty
average
ale
that
doesnt
do
justice
to
the
esb
style
really
enjoyed
this
esb
more
of
an
american
version
of
it
liked
the
esters
in
this
one
of
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
have
had
this
one
plenty
of
times
over
the
years
but
am
finally
getting
to
the
review
would
like
to
add
that
i
think
the
recipe
has
changed
a
little
from
recent
memory
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
vigorously
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
nice
white
head
and
good
carbonation
head
sticks
around
a
good
bit
before
finally
fading
smells
of
caramel
malts
with
a
breadytoasty
aroma
faint
hop
aroma
is
there
but
you
really
have
to
look
for
it
slight
chocolate
aroma
too
tastes
a
little
more
sweet
than
dry
again
the
caramel
malts
dominate
for
me
not
a
hoppy
beer
but
is
bitter
the
hop
presence
isnt
a
dominating
factor
a
solid
beer
but
a
little
one
dimensional
an
average
mouthfeel
in
getting
a
variety
case
from
stoudts
this
is
now
my
least
favorite
from
what
i
remember
this
one
used
to
be
a
lot
richer
and
tastier
from
a
few
years
ago
recipe
could
use
a
tweak
or
two
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
that
doesnt
leave
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
caramel
and
grain
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
hop
bitterness
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkablilty
a
pretty
standard
esb
not
amazing
but
still
pretty
solid
and
easy
drinking
wouldnt
buy
this
regularly
but
from
time
to
time
when
im
in
the
mood
i
would
harsh
flavor
of
a
very
dry
beer
astringent
the
hop
is
surprisingly
subtle
it
doesnt
match
the
typical
tastes
i
expect
for
an
esb
the
body
is
as
expected
the
aftertaste
dies
quickly
but
it
is
initially
dryish
d
a
decent
esb
but
more
hops
contribution
would
provide
a
more
interesting
beer
overall
midrange
for
the
style
at
best
not
bad
but
many
others
are
better
to
take
on
should
this
mahogany
colored
brew
be
compared
with
fullers
esb
i
do
not
think
so
that
is
apples
to
oranges
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
goes
into
a
film
with
some
lacing
malty
biscuty
aroma
a
caramel
sweetness
of
the
malt
first
then
the
slight
hops
bitterness
at
the
finish
drinkable
but
better
esbs
out
there
goes
down
ok
falls
between
styles
it
seems
that
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
it
seems
to
fail
to
create
its
own
identity
nothing
revolting
but
also
nothing
drawing
me
back
again
di
was
pretty
excited
as
this
was
my
first
beer
from
stoudts
i
really
like
esbs
and
was
expecting
good
things
but
the
complete
lack
of
carbonation
is
killing
this
beer
for
me
im
hoping
the
other
bottle
i
got
of
stoudts
is
more
impressive
drinkability
maybe
this
should
have
sat
longer
to
mellow
out
or
it
should
have
been
in
the
fermentor
a
bit
longer
i
dont
think
ill
be
giving
this
another
shot
d
great
for
a
few
in
my
early
days
of
craft
beer
consumption
not
that
long
ago
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
local
beers
sessionable
tasty
and
has
good
flavour
and
character
without
being
too
bold
for
a
newbie
plus
it
has
a
cool
name
and
label
alot
of
reviews
that
i
have
read
here
say
this
is
not
a
true
to
style
esb
i
havent
had
enough
esbs
to
really
have
an
opinion
in
this
regard
but
to
me
it
tastes
similiar
to
alot
of
brown
ales
that
ive
had
slighty
sweet
and
malt
forward
with
toasty
and
nutty
notes
maybe
a
little
buttery
too
dark
brown
and
gold
in
color
nice
head
but
no
lacing
and
minimal
retention
pretty
good
mouthfeel
not
too
slick
not
too
heavy
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
is
a
solid
session
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
esb
nothing
crazy
but
very
drinkable
for
sure
not
a
bad
way
to
open
up
the
afternoon
that
was
for
sure
d
definitely
drinkable
due
to
the
wellbalanced
nature
and
low
abv
but
not
much
here
to
keep
me
asking
for
more
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
two
inches

to
a

amount
of
sticky
lacing

left
on
the

aroma
is
full
of
crystal

the
hops
linger
in

but
do
give
herbal

the
flavor
does
not
suit
me
a
lot
of
crystal
malt
low
hop
flavor
and
mild
bitterness
somewhat
sweet
overall
a
bit
medicinal
has
a
nice
body
for
an
esb
carbonation
is
lively
without
being
harsh
the
malt
bill
in
this
one
does
not
suit
my
tastes
nice
abv
and
body
raises
the
drinkability
score
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
to
a
good
session
beer
but
the
biscuit
malt
tends
to
grow
to
strong
and
overpowers
the
other
flavors
this
is
very
quaffable
and
mostly
refreshing
yet
there
are
many
better
examples
of
the
style
available
for
the
price
i
have
enjoyed
all
of
the
products
from
this
brewery
this
one
is
not
at
the
same
level
as
their
other
offerings
12oz

in
a
standard
pint
glass
no

dating

poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
offwhite

that
dissipates
into
a
slick
and
a
band
no

on
this
one

is
light
but
getting
a
combination
of
cereal
grains
a
slightly
skunky
quality
and
some
light
aromatic
hops
taste
follows
nose
with
perhaps
some
caramel
malt
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
more
to
the
light
side
of
the
spectrum
and
lively
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
not
sure
if
this
is
an
off
bottle
but
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
dark
burgundy
color
with
minimal
head
still
appears
to
be
a
very
thick
brew
familiar
smell
like
cookies
something
sweet
going
on
here
not
sweet
like
a
barlywine
though
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
here
some
dark
fruits
at
first
sip
but
the
hops
are
helping
disappear
the
flavor
quickly
but
leaves
a
metal
like
flavor
in
the
after
taste
very
low
drinkable
nature
carbonation
really
hurts
the
mouth
flavor
d
good
aroma
fantastic
flavor
and
good
mouthfeel
combine
with
a
sessionable
alcohol
level
to
make
this
brew
exceptionally
drinkable
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
brew
is
a
clear
scarletamber
in
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
bready
but
not
a
lot
going
on
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
sweet
up
front
with
enough
hops
for
a
bitter
finish
alot
of
bready
grassy
notes
the
beer
is
lightmedium
body
and
paired
well
with
my
steak
tonight
overall
impression
somewhat
lacking
in
hop
presence
but
goes
down
easy
kind
of
sweet
nutty
toasty
maltiness
that
is
unmistakably
maris
otter
pretty
estery
here
too
a
little
too
much
actually
as
it
gets
in
the
way
of
the
other
elements
some
citrus
and
slightly
herbal
similar
too
the
aroma
not
too
english
with
hopping
maybe
willamette
at
best
enough
bitterness
to
make
this
nicely
balanced
carbonation
is
high
for
the
style
but
not
annoyingly
bubbly
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
fine
session
beer
in
my
opinion
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
pretty
refreshing
and
tasty
i
certainly
plan
to
pick
this
up
again
d
fits
right
in
there
for
the
style
but
there
is
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
to
make
this
memorable
a
good
all
around
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
malts
some
hops
taste
is
malty
up
front
hops
kicking
in
at
the
finish
slightly
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
takes
on
the
american
style
of
esbs
with
a
nice
full
hop
kick
but
it
makes
is
that
much
more
drinkable
with
the
balance
a
very
solid
beer
from
stoudts
that
i
would
drink
any
time
pretty
hop
forward
with
earthy
floral
bitter
hops
that
are
decently
balanced
by
the
morris
otter
malt
backbone
hints
of
caramel
biscuit
rye
hazelnut
and
toast
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
in
the
malt
that
counters
the
bitterness
up
front
pretty
well
dry
earthy
hop
finish
decent
session
beer
taste
is
very
malty
and
earth
a
bit
nutty
and
a
little
sweet
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
but
a
big
step
below
an
ipa
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
pleasant
but
not
overstated
in
any
facet
of
flavora
nice
case
filler
or
case
by
itself
though
smoother
nuttier
more
buttery
esbs
can
be
found
this
pleases
the
tastebuds
just
fine
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
that
absolute
best
esb
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
nice
sessionable
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
reddish
amber
hue
to
it
and
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
floral
hop
presence
rounding
out
the
smell
the
taste
is
of
floral
hops
up
front
which
yield
to
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
flavorful
but
it
is
not
overly
hoppy
like
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
and
what
you
would
expect
from
an
esb
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
is
slightly
better
than
most
in
this
class
i
liked
this
beer
good
quality
noted
that
the
best
by
date
was
listed
as
51909
enjoyed
in
aug
of
2009
so
a
bit
past
its
prime
i
didnt
feel
that
this
took
away
from
the
beer
at
all
was
pretty
complex
well
balanced
and
would
like
to
try
it
again
first
beer
of
the
night
at
kinsale
served
on
tap
in
a
imperial
pint
glass
it
had
quite
a
different
look
for
an
esb
the
color
was
a
lot
more
reddish
than
i
would
have
expected
almost
looked
like
an
amber
ale
not
much
noticed
when
i
took
a
deep
smell
taste
was
fairly
pleasing
slight
more
hoppiness
than
an
amber
ale
hint
of
fruit
on
the
palate
at
only
5
abv
and
with
a
deceivingly
good
drinkability
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
to
start
the
night
off
with
i
dont
often
order
esb
but
i
would
have
another
of
these
again
the
mouth
is
sturdy
and
a
bit
slick
this
went
really
well
with
my
tasty
food
well
done
a
refreshing
solid
beer
from
stoudts
that
is
nothing
too
extreme
but
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
bad
but
somewhat
odd
to
me
at
least
could
have
gone
a
more
traditional
and
stronger
route
with
this
d
very
drinkable
i
could
session
easily
super
refreshing
another
great
stoudts
brew
you
really
cant
go
too
wrong
with
the
variety
case
glad
that
they
are
a
local
brewery
for
me
overallsolid
esb
example
though
not
outstanding
does
retain
the
quality
i
have
come
to
expect
from
stoudts
mouth
is
bubbly
and
crisp
tastes
slightly
burnt
and
bitter
nice
crisp
bitter
hops
fade
to
a
toasted
sweetness
that
is
pleasant
not
bad
not
my
favorite
of
styles
but
a
good
representation
gave
this
one
a
little
to
vigorous
of
a
pour
but
this
has
great
head
retention
and
lots
of
fluffy
sticky
lacing
dark
brownish
red
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
bitter
slighly
sweet
aroma
there
is
a
nice
roasted
tone
in
the
taste
that
i
didnt
expect
from
the
scent
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
english
mild
low
abv
makes
this
very
drinkable
overall
good
flavors
but
just
a
little
boring
and
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
hops
drinkability
i
didnt
realize
i
was
drinking
an
esb
until
i
saw
the
classification
of
this
beer
its
too
heavy
on
the
malt
for
an
esb
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
it
was
a
real
smooth
drinking
beer
it
just
doesnt
fall
into
the
esb
category
well
body
is
lighter
than
most
good
esbs
that
i
have
had
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
good
malt
aftertaste
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
overall
i
am
fairly
new
to
esbs
so
im
not
sure
if
scarlet
lady
is
a
pristine
interpritation
of
the
style
or
not
however
after
half
a
case
or
so
i
think
it
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
it
has
moved
into
my
top
5
go
to
beers
not
too
bitter
but
it
does
well
to
satisfy
a
hop
craving
overall
she
is
my
favorite
esb
i
love
the
malt
flavor
and
aroma
on
this
one
a
wonderful
example
of
what
an
esb
should
be
like
love
that
scarlet
lady
overall
a
fine
esb
better
than
many
i
have
tried
would
not
have
anticipated
that
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
so
much
thanks
to
skinnyelvis
for
the
bottle
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
best
by

appears
a
clear
crimsonamber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
ecru
foam
the
head
settles
to
a
thin
layer
within
a
few
moments
leaving
minimal
lacing
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
smell
is
dominated
by
caramel
malts
and
bread
tastes
of
bitter
grassy
hops
toasted
grains
biscuity
caramelized
malts
and
sourdough
bread
towards
the
end
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
bitter
and
dry
from
start
to
finish
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
d
this
is
decent
though
i
really
like
the
stouts
versions
of
german
brews
which
are
totally
in
their
wheelhouse
nonetheless
we
were
surprised
it
was
not
skunky
or
bad
at
all
poured
a
nice
amber
with
light
tan
head
that
retained
very
and
laced
decently
smell
was
of
bold
malts
caramel
sourcerealness
barely
asserting
taste
was
actually
good
with
some
malty
sweetness
wellbalanced
with
the
slight
bitterness
nice
depth
for
sure
not
too
carbonated
a
little
thin
but
pleasantly
so
thus
making
this
quite
drinkable
will
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
soon
i
am
sure
it
is
even
better
d
easy
drinking
as
is
to
be
expected
from
an
esb
personally
however
i
dont
know
that
i
would
have
several
in
a
single
go
though
i
might
i
will
enjoy
the
others
in
the
fridge
though
d
rather
average
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
a
brew
with
an
excellent
appearance
that
is
a
slight
let
down
in
all
other
categories
aside
from
the
less
then
clean
finish
the
slightly
off
smell
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
esb
just
enough
hop
presence
a
good
backing
of
malt
without
adding
unnecessary
body
drink
is
realtively
good
but
couldnt
see
myself
have
anymore
than
a
few
really
dont
like
esbs
ontap
at
woodys
served
in
a
standard
pintglass
the
beer
is
served
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
some
slight
malts
but
a
little
weak
the
taste
is
a
decent
blend
of
caramel
malts
and
bitter
hops
leave
a
decent
finish
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slight
dryness
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
ive
had
better
of
the
style
hops
arent
really
detectable
at
all
the
balance
or
lack
thereof
swings
towards
the
malts
in
this
one
very
light
and
dry
somewhat
watery
hardly
any
bitterness
pretty
disappointing
nothing
spectacular
but
a
solid
session
brew
disclaimer
this
is
not
a
style
i
am
well
versed
in
and
i
typically
drink
fairly
big
beers
pours
a
dark
orange
brown
color
with
a
small
beige
head
that
leaves
some
soapy
sticking
malty
nose
for
an
esb
rye
bread
toasted
grain
really
husky
and
slightly
bready
in
the
nose
could
easily
be
confused
for
a
funk
of
sorts
but
i
dont
hate
it
bright
and
lively
upon
sipping
cinnamon
sugar
non
offensive
cider
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
late
leafy
hop
bitterness
that
sticks
around
and
blends
an
earthy
after
taste
with
a
coating
malty
sweetness
very
nice
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
out
playing
the
light
body
good
drinkability
d
nice
low
abv
and
a
decent
taste
make
for
a
good
two
pints
not
my
favorite
style
but
ill
look
for
this
again
in
the
summertime
not
excessively
bitter
pours
a
clear
deep
copperamber
color
with
steady
carbonation
and
a
thick
off
white
head
with
nice
retention
and
thick
lines
of
lacing
grainy
toasted
malt
aroma
slightly
sweet
with
little
bitterness
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
with
active
carbonation
and
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
flavor
is
bready
and
malty
nothing
exciting
but
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
d
light
bodied
as
far
as
some
bitters
go
but
overall
medium
thats
easy
to
drink
drinks
amazingly
well
solid
malt
backbone
with
crisp
not
overpowering
hop
accents
a
great
beer
for
someone
looking
to
explore
the
world
of
hops
and
bitter
beer
in
general
golden
amber
with
a
medium
head
and
decent
retention
some
spots
of
lacing
and
slow
steady
carbonation
good
smell
somewhat
fruity
with
light
caramel
and
bready
undertones
earthy
hop
presence
tastes
great
too
lightly
toasted
grains
and
a
biscuity
malt
carry
throughout
and
compliment
well
again
some
fruity
flavors
a
bit
herbal
and
tea
like
along
with
the
hops
very
well
balanced
solid
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
never
too
much
thirst
quenching
sessionable
beer
in
my
book
i
wouldnt
mind
some
more
the
drink
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
stickiness
that
limits
its
drinkability
a
bit
not
bad
smooth
feel
and
very
drinkable
as
i
said
before
i
like
what
stoudts
does
drinkability
yep
this
ones
fourpointohs
all
the
way
down
a
very
enjoyable
esb
perhaps
a
bit
weak
on
the
bitters
for
the
style
but
overall
very
nice

feels
very
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
sampled
out
of
a
bottle
at
the
beverage
warehouse
beer
tasting
event
this
beer
was
a
slightly
cloudy
bronzecopper
color
the
head
was
a
thin
offwhite
cap
that
retained
fairly
well
and
left
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
semisweet
blend
of
roasted
malt
and
pale
malt
the
flavors
were
also
semisweet
but
indeed
bitter
as
well
though
i
found
the
hop
profile
understated
for
the
style
being
slightly
masked
by
the
biscuitlike
malt
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
very
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
carbonation
onpoint
not
bad
but
i
believe
ive
had
better
examples
its
still
drinkable
but
for
some
reason
i
cant
seem
to
figure
out
the
flavors
and
no
i
dont
have
a
cold
still
worth
a
shot
but
you
can
do
better
for
the
style
its
a
good
solid
beer
thats
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
but
no
the
kind
of
beer
i
will
remember
and
think
about
as
special
or
a
must
have
d
average
at
best
on
the
fence
on
this
one
a
decent
example
but
wont
wow
you
in
the
process
d
this
is
my
first
esb
and
from
what
i
got
i
think
i
could
enjoy
it
especially
being
from
stoudts
i
must
admit
this
is
my
favorite
beer
style
but
stoudts
esb
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
has
a
nice
malty
taste
to
it
and
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
appearance
is
a
little
drab
just
pouring
a
cloudy
reddish
orange
and
smell
isnt
too
prominent
the
rest
of
stoudts
lineup
is
much
better
imo
poured
a
coppereqsue
body
with
a
twofinger
head
that
dropped
to
onefinger
and
stuck
around
a
large
hoppy
smell
with
some
floral
notes
and
also
hints
of
caramel
and
maybe
even
a
roasted
malt
or
two
very
light
and
a
little
watery
almost
herbal
tealike
while
smooth
and
creamy
there
is
only
a
slight
sweet
malt
taste
and
there
isnt
much
of
a
hop
punch
at
all
to
talk
about
a
decent
beer
but
not
really
a
great
representive
of
the
esb
style
d
this
one
is
very
sessionable
it
goes
down
very
easy
this
poured
a
dark
amber
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
barley
and
red
malt
with
earthy
wheat
and
slight
lemon
and
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
earthy
barley
and
roasted
malt
balanced
with
sour
copper
hops
it
was
watery
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
clean
and
mellow
malty
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
beer
there
was
nothing
too
impressive
about
it
but
it
was
fairly
enjoyable
especially
in
the
late
summer
or
early
fall
this
seems
like
a
pretty
weak
esb
color
is
light
brown
maybe
some
orange
in
there
not
much
head
or
lacing
sweet
fruity
aroma
such
as
oranges
or
mango
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
pretty
good
balance
but
it
just
seems
a
little
bland
theres
a
fruity
malt
note
with
some
faint
bitter
hops
and
a
pretty
clean
finish
but
the
whole
thing
just
seems
watered
down
a
little
overall
its
ok
but
its
not
a
very
good
esb
cheers
d
pretty
drinkable
as
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
i
could
enjoy
this
as
a
nice
session
brew
d
call
this
a
starter
bitter
for
those
just
moving
into
categories
certainly
wont
scare
you
off
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
stoudts
has
an
interested
and
low
key
take
on
this
style
nice
sized
dirty
white
head
that
left
patchy
lacing
its
ahazey
orangeamber
color
smell
is
mainly
carmel
malts
with
fruity
and
herbal
hops
i
also
semll
some
toasted
malts
as
in
the
nose
the
carmal
and
toasted
malts
come
through
with
a
little
fruity
hop
flavor
to
go
with
some
bitter
hop
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
being
neither
thin
nor
full
bodied
its
not
one
id
drink
a
lot
of
purelly
because
it
seemed
a
little
mild
to
me
all
the
way
around
pours
a
deep
cherry
red
with
good
head
that
falls
to
light
lacing
the
beer
has
almost
no
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
strong
malty
almost
ryelike
with
a
woody
edge
and
a
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
given
the
strength
of
the
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
beautiful
dark
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
toasted
biscuity
malt
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
aroma
with
malt
some
caramel
and
hops
in
the
finish
overall
stoudts
scarlet
lady
is
a
decent
esb
but
nothing
that
i
would
purchase
again
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
a
beer
from
this
brewery
i
wish
i
could
get
some
of
their
higher
rated
stuff
as
they
seem
to
be
much
hyped
this
one
is
easy
enough
to
drink
though
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
with
a
tickly
finish
good
session
beer
very
drinkable
overall
not
bat
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
d
not
overly
drinkable
but
decent
i
could
session
this
in
the
winter
but
not
in
this
heat
good
drinkability
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
which
dissapates
fairly
quickly
the
smell
was
of
toasty
malts
fruits
and
a
nice
hints
of
hops
the
malty
sweetness
dominates
and
the
hops
dont
really
show
up
to
the
dance
which
i
expect
from
an
esb
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
falls
short
of
being
a
great
esb
and
is
just
average
i
expect
more
from
an
esb
in
terms
of
hops
like
the
stoudts
brews
and
this
is
my
latest
try
this
beer
has
a
scarlet
and
rust
color
but
not
much
head
sorta
laces
the
glass
ring
aroma
is
dry
crackers
and
other
malts
not
much
in
the
hops
department
taste
is
quite
malty
but
with
a
nice
bitter
backbone
and
after
taste
a
bit
more
bitter
than
most
of
this
style
hoppy
and
a
little
dry
a
good
brew
d
when
fresh
this
pretty
good
but
my
close
proximity
to
stoudts
means
that
something
i
like
more
is
usually
available
d
easily
drinkable
and
nice
to
have
on
hand
for
a
nice
hot
day
goes
down
and
smooth
and
no
forcing
either
poured
clear
brownish
red
with
a
decent
head
with
minimal
lacing
there
was
an
earthy
smell
with
some
underlying
malt
and
breadiness
toasted
malt
with
some
hop
bittnerness
on
the
finish
kind
of
watery
and
thin
and
very
easy
to
drink
finishes
dry
and
crisp
not
quite
the
same
as
an
english
esb
but
not
bad
and
quite
drinkable
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
definitely
makes
this
beer
drinkable
worth
a
sixer
or
a
session
englishstyle
esb
and
american
esb
final
thoughts
i
liked
this
one
very
nice
interpretation
of
an
esb
drinkability
is
average
on
this
beer
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
better
tasting
beer
when
i
ordered
this
esb
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
alright
but
doesnt
blow
you
away
not
bad
but
not
great
either
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
very
slightly
spiced
and
caramel
the
taste
is
too
watery
for
me
malty
with
some
caramel
light
body
almost
drinkable
this
is
a
disappointment
to
me
since
ive
had
better
brews
from
stoudts
overall
decently
drinkable
but
certainly
nothing
fantastic
d
another
one
of
stoudts
delicious
offerings
this
one
is
easy
to
session
and
also
great
with
a
meal
worked
well
with
salmon
and
roasted
potatoes
poured
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
light
head
with
poor
retention
and
not
a
lot
of
lacing
smelled
of
sweet
sweet
malts
and
yeast
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
with
a
good
balancing
bitterness
there
is
a
dry
hop
finish
with
a
lemon
water
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
not
great
for
the
style
but
still
good
d
decent
i
could
put
a
few
away
before
having
to
move
on
not
an
outstanding
esb
but
certainly
an
enjoyable
one
worth
a
try
stoudt
makes
much
better
beers
than
this
one
mouthfeel
is
good
nothing
spectacular
but
a
rather
drinkable
beer
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
decidedly
average
i
may
try
a
fresher
on
to
see
if
it
changes
my
opinion
at
all
decent
mouthfeel
this
esb
has
good
body
and
is
a
great
drinkable
example
of
the
style
i
could
definitely
hit
these
all
day
long
if
the
calling
arose
overall
a
decent
esb
good
drinkability
on
cask
d
solid
esb
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
stoudts
first
time
on
cask
nothing
mildblowing
but
still
very
nice
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
in
a
session
as
it
goes
down
easy
but
theres
not
much
there
in
terms
of
yearning
for
flavor
with
each
sip
but
for
a
balanced
and
fairly
tasty
and
tame
session
brew
this
could
work
for
a
lot
of
people
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
medium
dark
brown
slightly
reddish
with
a
short
tan
head
left
a
little
lacing
as
it
disappeared
smells
malty
and
sweet
a
little
toasty
malty
in
taste
some
bread
like
flavors
maybe
a
little
hops
in
the
finish
also
slightly
metallic
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
crisp
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
when
i
was
first
introduced
to
the
scarlet
lady
in
2000
it
was
my
first
taste
of
an
esb
or
really
anything
not
from
a
north
american
macro
plant
i
was
smitten
with
the
fact
i
could
taste
the
hops
and
that
beer
didnt
need
that
funny
aftertaste
that
i
eventually
found
to
be
corn
even
so
the
beer
was
very
good
and
very
clean
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
last
two
cases
i
have
had
have
some
bottling
issue
the
scarlet
lady
is
a
little
metallic
from
the
bottle
i
stopped
by
stoudts
over
the
summer
about
4
months
ago
and
the
beer
from
the
tap
did
not
have
this
taste
i
fear
stoudts
is
trying
to
bottle
more
beer
than
their
line
can
handle
alas
i
shall
re0review
the
old
girl
the
bottle
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
white
head
about
one
finger
deep
the
smell
is
light
and
floral
but
has
a
hint
of
a
metallic
edge
in
it
the
taste
is
great
up
front
it
hits
with
a
floral
hop
taste
and
aroma
that
is
pleasant
and
not
overbearing
the
malt
begins
to
work
its
way
through
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
it
finishes
clean
unfortunately
just
as
you
are
enjoying
the
taste
of
he
sip
alight
metallic
taste
disrupts
the
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
this
beer
is
super
drinkable
even
with
the
off
aftertaste
scarlet
lady
is
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
i
simply
hope
stoudts
clears
out
their
bottling
lines
soon
cheers
i
really
think
this
beer
would
be
great
if
it
werent
so
attenuated
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
and
the
appearance
appealing
the
dryness
just
adds
harshness
and
masks
any
malt
flavors
try
it
for
yourself
pours
a
nice
rubycopper
color
with
very
little
head
but
nice
lacing
and
pleasant
earth
and
malt
aroma
similarly
the
taste
is
both
malty
and
heavy
but
the
mouthfeel
while
not
light
is
crisp
and
balanced
the
density
of
the
malt
is
cut
by
the
slightly
hoppy
flavor
that
is
present
this
beer
skirts
the
line
of
a
heavy
malty
beer
and
a
lighter
ale
and
is
a
nicely
put
together
esb
it
is
definitely
full
bodied
and
nicely
nuanced
in
my
experience
it
is
probably
on
the
heavier
side
of
esbs
but
i
really
like
it
a
good
beer
from
a
very
good
brewer
d
an
ok
beer
good
not
great
probably
wont
buy
again
but
worth
a
shot
for
the
esb
fan
2007
bottle
youd
think
the
hop
shortages
had
already
started
after
drinking
this
one
pours
a
slightly
clouded
ruby
brown
with
a
lighter
tan
head
nose
is
hopped
and
slightly
cherry
sweet
with
a
stronger
overall
sugary
tone
to
it
flavor
is
lacking
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
traditional
but
it
falls
off
way
too
fast
almost
tastes
like
semi
stale
pretzels
or
just
pretzels
in
general
there
is
an
overall
bitter
tone
to
it
but
i
just
think
it
lacks
feel
is
nice
with
a
decent
carbonation
drinkable
yes
isnt
horrid
but
its
definitely
not
the
best
esb
youve
ever
had
medium
body
fairly
drinkable
might
not
be
the
best
esb
weak
on
the
hops
combining
the
sweetness
of
cherries
with
a
hearty
wiff
of
alcohol
scarlet
lady
smelled
delicious
from
the
word
go
and
tasted
just
as
awesome
each
sip
offered
up
a
cinnamony
flavor
maybe
that
was
just
the
hops
with
an
awesome
aftertaste
that
seemed
nutty
at
first
but
eventually
reminded
me
of
the
taste
of
ginger
beer
was
nothing
short
of
surprising
and
stood
out
among
the
many
esbs
ive
tried
as
superbly
flavorful
original
and
drinkable
feels
a
bit
bubbly
and
thick
leaves
a
light
film
its
really
delicious
bitter
but
sweet
and
bready
excellent
one
of
the
more
english
american
esbs
ive
had
id
certainly
enjoy
another
pretty
good
especially
as
it
warms
up
which
is
probably
appropriate
given
the
english
origins
of
the
style
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
fromt
stoudts
off
white
small
head
sits
atop
of
a
nice
ruby
colored
body
grassy
hops
and
malts
in
the
nose
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
and
sweet
malts
pretty
easy
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
its
not
bitter
like
i
thought
it
would
be
good
stuff
though
tasty
burps
caramel
tasting
malts
not
my
favorite
beer
from
stoudts
pours
very
dark
with
a
bit
of
coffee
colors
in
the
middle
and
redamber
tinges
on
the
outsides
of
the
liquid
no
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
buttery
yeast
notes
rye
bread
and
earthy
hops
the
hops
are
a
background
component
though
on
the
palate
things
are
malty
and
onedimensional
with
a
touch
of
slightly
metallic
hops
sitting
atop
heavy
teaish
malts
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
flat
and
unlively
overall
this
is
lackluster
with
little
to
recommend
it
overall
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
and
i
feel
as
if
ive
had
a
better
esb
from
stoudts
on
tap
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
here
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
im
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
another
brew
from
stoudts
but
i
found
this
one
weak
i
prefer
a
bolder
esb
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
aromas
a
small
sweet
malt
presence
and
a
small
peppery
hop
it
has
a
small
bitterness
sweet
malty
and
a
bit
earthy
taste
very
clean
aftertaste
just
a
small
sweet
malt
presence
lingers
easy
to
drink
kind
of
hoping
for
more
bitterness
but
it
is
nice
a
very
nice
esb
overall
bitterness
and
sweetness
balance
each
other
nicely
and
the
overall
flavor
is
wonderful
i
could
drink
these
all
day
with
the
100f
heat
we
have
here
today
i
just
might
do
that
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
slighlty
dry
finish
make
this
a
perfect
sessioner
d
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
while
the
component
flavor
appearance
etc
arent
fantastic
a
good
mouthfeel
and
taste
combine
well
into
a
beer
thats
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
aroma
is
not
strong
but
pleasantly
malty
from
the
bottle
it
pours
a
lovely
dark
brownish
gold
with
a
nice
thick
head
flavor
is
richly
malty
and
has
a
smoky
undertone
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
no
bitterness
in
the
flavor
or
aftertaste
a
pleasantly
drinkable
ale
drinkability
makes
for
light
refreshing
drinking
d
yes
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
would
venture
to
have
this
one
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rustic
copper
with
a
fuffy
head
that
leavs
some
thick
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
citrusy
hoppy
with
a
burnt
woody
smell
mild
taste
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
weed
and
bark
with
some
citrus
fruits
not
overwhelming
in
taste
and
pretty
smooth
going
down
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
a
great
offering
not
enought
flavor
in
my
book
drinkability
definitely
drinkable
but
fairly
light
sessionable
but
not
something
to
enjoy
just
one
bottle
of
d
the
cask
serving
brings
out
the
simple
beauty
of
this
ale
a
chewy
ale
that
has
a
strong
hop
bite
its
subtle
which
can
be
such
a
strength
but
subtlety
demands
an
underlying
depth
and
complexity
that
really
isnt
present
here
the
result
is
an
enjoyably
drinkable
bitter
that
doesnt
have
enough
oomph
to
inspire
one
to
seek
out
more
id
have
no
reason
to
say
no
to
another
but
it
could
easily
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
of
more
notable
offerings
typical
thinner
mouthfeel
being
a
caskconditioned
beer
very
easy
drinking
and
highly
enjoyable
d
its
alright
i
dunno
i
havent
really
been
that
impressed
with
any
stoudts
ive
had
yet
so
im
not
that
surprised
d
pretty
good
beer
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
hoppy
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
fat
tire
actually
thanks
to
jasonm
for
this
one
via
trade
soudts
makes
wonderful
beers
but
this
is
one
of
ther
least
worthy
efforts
it
doesnt
hve
the
body
i
expect
from
an
esb
it
doesnt
hold
up
against
food
as
well
as
other
esbs
that
i
have
had
it
has
a
nice
deep
red
color
and
the
head
was
rather
nice
there
was
little
in
the
smell
to
appeal
to
me
it
had
a
clean
taste
but
lacked
the
maltiness
i
expect
from
the
style
i
can
drink
this
but
with
stoudts
other
offerings
i
dont
pours
a
red
coppery
brown
with
a
medium
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
constant
thin
head
has
almost
no
scent
kind
of
disappointing
slightly
bitter
fairly
malty
nice
mouthfeel
thick
with
light
carbonation
not
a
typical
esb
not
a
bad
brew
very
tasty
good
but
there
are
better
brews
from
stoudts
medium
bodygrainysome
sourness
goes
down
fairly
easy
just
nothing
to
really
make
me
want
to
drink
more
d
yeah
its
drinkable
but
i
wish
the
hops
were
more
apparent
and
malts
gave
off
more
flavor
pretty
average
here
this
was
another
pleasant
experience
with
stoudts
they
make
some
quality
beer
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
white
head
and
laces
all
the
way
down
the
glass
a
nice
looking
brew
smells
of
some
caramel
and
perhaps
a
little
chocolatey
spice
a
little
peppery
spice
also
decent
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
it
tastes
like
a
baby
brother
of
an
american
strong
ale
but
of
course
not
nearly
as
strong
medium
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
it
doesnt
fit
with
style
well
but
is
a
decent
beer
especially
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeter
beer
with
just
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
it
does
go
down
pretty
easily
and
though
sweet
never
becomes
cloying
in
all
they
nearly
missed
the
mark
completely
on
style
but
turns
out
to
be
a
decent
easy
sessionable
poured
to
a
hazy
orangered
with
mdium
offwhite
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
and
left
okay
lacing
initial
aroma
was
hoppy
citrus
grapefruit
and
floral
however
this
dissipated
and
becme
muted
as
the
beer
warmed
flavor
was
likewise
the
hoppy
floral
with
a
nice
bitter
palate
true
to
form
the
dry
bitter
finish
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
for
me
d
pretty
drinkable
easy
to
knock
back
but
not
my
favorite
esb
by
far
overall
impression
this
is
a
decidely
average
beer
not
bad
and
id
be
able
to
drink
quite
a
few
but
it
just
really
doesnt
excite
me
this
esb
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
and
provides
a
nice
drinking
experience
a
good
session
choice
the
drinkability
is
good
i
like
this
beer
but
not
enough
to
but
a
lot
mk
nice
initial
bittering
levels
that
tone
down
slowly
as
the
beer
settles
onto
your
tongue
less
pervasive
hop
flavor
than
most
esbs
but
hop
bittering
is
good
and
the
hops
that
do
come
through
are
earthier
rather
than
robust
or
floral
the
aftertaste
has
faint
notes
of
raspberry
tea
subtle
tastes
throughout
but
taste
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
all
quite
serviceable
drinkability
decent
a
completely
forgettable
beer
this
is
a
shame
stoudts
makes
many
great
beers
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
d
i
was
surprised
when
my
glass
was
empty
goes
down
very
easily
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
was
a
red
ale
both
before
and
after
i
drank
one
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
a
small
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
spice
with
herbal
accents
tastes
sweet
and
of
spice
a
little
heavy
going
down
but
it
still
finished
very
crisp
a
very
drinkable
esb
im
a
little
torn
on
how
to
review
it
though
if
reviewing
as
an
esb
i
wouldnt
score
it
very
high
as
the
bitterness
just
isnt
there
but
if
i
never
read
the
label
and
assumed
it
was
a
red
ale
id
score
it
appropriately
so
i
decided
to
review
it
based
purely
on
its
characteristics
and
not
its
style
whew
hope
that
makes
sense
so
in
summary
a
rather
enjoyable
offering
from
the
folks
in
adamstown
ive
hear
others
say
that
as
esbs
go
this
one
isnt
as
hoppy
im
not
a
hops
fanatic
though
i
love
a
nice
hop
flavor
this
one
delivers
stoudts
makes
some
great
beers
but
this
one
is
unique
in
their
lineupat
least
among
those
commony
found
nice
redamber
color
with
decent
head
of
foam
hops
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
is
at
first
maltflavorful
carmel
maltand
then
the
hops
hits
you
like
a
mild
chili
sauce
that
keeps
delivering
a
punch
the
hops
stays
with
you
for
awhile
but
its
definitely
not
overpowering
and
very
drinkable
very
good
crystal
clear
deep
copper
thick
dense
head
of
off
white
foam
that
dimples
profusely
while
settling
to
a
thick
cap
with
a
tall
popped
collar
bands
of
sticky
lacing
rim
the
glass
with
sheets
clinging
as
the
glass
is
emptied
fine
lines
of
snaking
carbonation
aromas
of
caramel
maltiness
and
spicy
hops
that
are
a
touch
with
a
bit
of
fruit
fill
the
nose
a
brief
spicy
hop
flavor
leads
into
an
ample
malt
body
before
reverting
back
to
a
slightly
fruityspicy
lemony
hop
bite
the
finish
is
short
and
only
moderately
crisp
with
a
light
edge
that
is
also
a
bit
drying
mediumlight
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
nonoffensive
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
decent
but
did
not
stand
out
and
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
try
on
draft
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
longlasting
moderate
head
smell
is
faint
but
has
notes
of
sweet
malts
im
not
able
to
tease
any
other
taste
out
of
this
brew
taste
is
a
lot
like
honey
with
an
allencompassing
mouthfeel
of
sweetness
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
as
well
there
is
a
strange
other
taste
about
34
of
the
way
through
that
makes
it
a
bit
sour
almost
like
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
yeast
or
it
was
contaminated
in
addition
to
this
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
diversity
in
the
beer
however
it
goes
down
easy
and
thats
always
a
good
thing
final
thought
i
like
it
but
it
is
nothing
special
brewed
from
one
of
the
greatest
breweries
in
the
country
but
i
cant
label
this
as
an
esb
more
like
a
doppelbock
light
ill
have
a
gl
moondog
ale
instead
flavor
is
very
malty
and
sweet
nice
biscuit
tones
hold
this
beer
together
very
well
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
very
end
but
not
quie
like
most
other
esbs
i
have
tasted
full
body
and
a
bit
sticky
actually
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
it
was
very
simple
easily
drinkable
could
make
a
session
beer
but
there
really
wasnt
much
going
on
in
here
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
want
another
one
of
these
aroma
is
malty
but
ever
so
slightly
toasty
warm
smelling
really
whcih
gives
it
a
baked
bread
smell
some
herbal
accented
hops
i
assume
it
is
hops
are
also
present
body
is
a
rich
amber
and
holds
a
thumb
thick
tan
head
that
is
mostly
lasting
sweet
but
subtle
malt
is
even
in
intenisty
from
start
to
finish
light
hops
ride
atop
and
balance
the
malt
nicely
its
kind
of
plain
but
in
a
nice
easy
drinking
way
that
i
find
enjoyable
the
ever
so
slightly
toasted
breadbiscuit
notes
are
just
damn
comforting
a
stab
at
a
traditional
english
style
esb
tealike
herbal
hops
small
hop
bite
fruity
and
biscuity
malt
medium
bodied
hoppy
finish
and
aftertaste
hops
linger
on
a
low
level
good
stuff
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
nice
session
beer
moderately
creamy
mouthfeel
keeps
this
interesting
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
easy
drinker
but
not
a
lot
of
wow
factor
fairly
smooth
but
not
too
exciting
its
not
too
bad
in
the
end
but
not
what
id
expect
from
a
good
esb
more
hops
better
malt
profile
and
maybe
a
bit
more
carbonation
d
im
liking
this
a
good
session
brew
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
great
for
a
hot
day
just
not
the
most
complex
thing
in
the
world
even
for
the
style
a
nice
esb
nice
and
quenching
but
nothing
great
easily
forgotten
cheers
thanks
to
maltygoodness
for
another
fine
pa
brew
peace
another
solid
offering
pretty
average
in
the
style
well
balanced
leaning
towards
bitter
in
the
end
im
in
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
have
gone
back
to
this
one
many
times
over
the
years
nothing
really
to
write
home
about
after
sampling
this
beer
again
i
can
say
ill
probobly
never
drink
it
again
pours
a
deep
red
almost
brown
with
a
small
head
that
fades
to
a
bubblecover
after
a
minute
or
so
smell
is
oddly
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
mild
but
not
bad
some
citrusy
and
piney
hops
which
is
a
bit
odd
for
the
style
but
ok
smooth
mouthfeel
but
a
dull
bitter
aftertaste
that
detracts
a
bit
does
clarks
just
have
an
old
keg
here
what
gives
this
is
another
good
beer
from
stoudts
lets
just
say
i
wont
regret
the
one
night
stand
but
i
wouldnt
take
her
home
to
mom
a
goodbutnotgreat
beer
i
know
stoudts
brews
better
beers
this
is
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
esb
but
its
not
an
awardwinner
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
in
fact
it
is
really
hitting
the
spot
right
now
it
is
light
enough
and
quite
quaffable
with
lots
of
hop
and
malt
character
to
keep
the
flavors
intriguing
and
interesting
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
from
the
initial
50f
the
hop
character
becomes
a
bit
more
assertive
perhaps
leaving
a
touch
less
well
balanced
overall
a
nice
esb
not
1
thatll
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
pleasant
just
a
hair
above
mediocre
bitter
d
a
pretty
good
session
beer
but
not
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
its
unique
and
exciting
still
pretty
good
drinkability
overall
i
have
had
nixed
experiences
with
this
beer
in
the
past
but
now
that
i
have
had
a
fresh
bottle
this
beer
appeals
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
make
up
the
flavor
alcohol
peeks
through
which
is
surprising
as
this
is
a
relitively
low
abv
ale
this
looks
and
smells
nice
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
in
the
flavor
department
ruddy
and
bland
its
not
something
i
would
care
to
have
again
a
less
than
average
esb
like
something
millerab
would
have
came
up
with
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
hefty
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
frothy
head
that
left
behind
bits
of
lacing
various
hues
in
the
beer
gave
it
a
distinct
glow
and
shimmer
aromas
of
burnt
wood
hops
citrus
and
roasted
malts
together
these
scents
seemed
to
suggest
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
doppelbock
it
seemed
interesting
at
first
but
quickly
became
somewhat
repugnant
and
unappealing
the
taste
however
is
enjoyable
and
smooth
with
a
refreshing
citrus
character
that
works
very
well
with
the
roasted
malt
flavors
adding
depth
and
wonderful
texture
to
the
beer
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
with
a
lingering
sensation
in
my
throat
good
drinkabilty
due
to
the
flavors
and
lower
abv
but
the
aromas
given
off
by
the
beer
can
be
a
big
distraction
it
was
for
me
unfortunately
this
isnt
one
of
stoudts
better
offerings
an
infusion
of
hops
is
the
obvious
fix
if
nothing
else
that
would
put
some
much
needed
b
in
this
esb
as
is
the

worth

much
less

on

for
me
though
its
not
bad
just
pretty
average
lots
of
toasty

upfront
a

middle
that
washes
away

and
leads
through

this
beer
appeared
a

which
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
for
a

it
tasted
very
malty
with
a
decent
but
certainly
not
overwhelming
hop
backbone
which
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
what
im
used
to
this
is
a
nice
bitter
the
likes
of
which
all
pubs
should
have
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
brew
but
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
mouthfeel
is
really
lovely

well

with

aftertaste
a
good
second
drink
after
my
porter
though
others
may
want
more
strongly
bitter
brew
despite
mediocre
labels
this
is
a
good
brewery
poured
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
copper
color
wit
a
large
head
to
start
that
fell
to
a
sticky
lacy
ring
smell
is
a
perfect
combination
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
with
some
caramel
noted
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
the
malt
and
hops
coming
together
nicely
with
neither
dominating
but
really
complimenting
each
other
in
good
proportions
finish
is
a
bit
subtle
for
my
liking
but
still
enjoyable
i
found
this
to
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
was
thirst
quenching
would
make
a
great
session
beer
a
decent
mild
esbmalty
upfront
some
sourness
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
pleasant
still
there
are
hints
of
apples
in
the
flavor
too
pretty
smooth
mfthere
is
a
seltzerish
feel
to
the
carbonation
drinkable
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
am
dying
to
stock
up
on
overall
i
will
always
try
a
new
beer
at
least
once
but
i
wont
be
bothering
with
this
one
again
either
way
quite
drinkable
not
sure
if
any
of
the
six
pack
survived
the
tailgate
notes
not
my
favorite
esb
probably
just
average
the
expiration
date
on
this
bottle
is
122005
so
this
is
very
fresh
beers
like
this
change
fairly
quickly
this
is
an
exemplary
representation
of
the
style
and
the
freshness
had
something
to
do
with
that
i
believe
darn
fine
esb
which
is
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
drinkability
very
good
unlike
many
esbs
ive
had
in
the
past
this
one
is
not
oppressively
bitter
which
makes
the
prospect
of
a
second
a
reality
as
opposed
to
a
hopeful
fantasy
mouthfeel
is
medium
nice
to
drink
a
decent
esb
even
if
it
does
lean
more
towards
the
malt
i
could
session
this
one
i
would
recommend
giving
this
a
try
not
my
favorite
but
like
i
said
i
am
just
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
good
esb
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
slight
tan
lace
that
lingers
for
awhile
the
look
of
the
beer
is
nice
and
clear
with
a
smell
of
toffee
and
nuts
the
taste
on
the
palate
is
sweet
malty
with
some
hop
kick
to
it
i
taste
caramel
toffee
and
nuts
i
like
this
beer
i
would
def
get
it
again
worth
a
try
as
mentioned
this
one
isnt
bad
but
needs
some
tinkering
ive
had
better
from
stoudts
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
about
as
average
of
an
esb
as
possible
this
is
not
a
hard
style
to
make
complex
or
fun
and
this
one
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
test
stoudts
hasnt
been
impressing
me
as
much
as
they
used
to
its
either
the
fact
that
these
beers
are
brewed
in
adamstown
now
instead
of
fredericksburg
or
my
taste
in
beer
and
my
palate
has
matured
lets
hope
its
the
latter
a
burnt
amber
color
with
a
dense
head
of
firmly
packed
baby
bubbles
that
produces
a
head
of
ample
froth
aroma
is
laden
with
caramel
notes
and
toasty
nuts
mouthfeel
is
medium
flavor
is
sweet
and
then
followed
by
enough
bitterness
to
make
this
a
good
example
of
a
real
esb
great
beer

the
sediment
into
the
glass
so
its
faily
cloudy
smells
quite
hoppy
with
woody
and
citrus
notes
kgoldings
some
fruity
esters
carry
the
hops
and
i
think
i
get
some
vienna
malt
too
tastes
mild
malt
sweet
witha
mild
tang
in
the
middle
after
the
swallow
a
fantastic
fruity
malt
rises
up
my
throat
and
hangs
on
the
back
part
of
my
tongue
wow
that
was
a
neat
experience
its
got
some
rougher
hop
character
citrus
and
grassy
not
grapefruit
like
american
hops
woody
citrus
and
sour
piney
the
bitter
is
more
than
i
like
in
an
esb
but
im
a
hohead
it
adds
an
interesting
dimesnion
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
light
not
macroswill
light
its
soft
with
mild
carbonation
lifint
any
viscosity
so
the
beer
doesnt
coat
the
tongue
very
nice
with
searching
i
guess
its
mediumbodied
but
appears
less
because
of
the
creamy
and
carbonation
gives
it
the
experience
of
lightness
on
sale
today
at
spirit
haus
it
was
a
good
deal
and
i
like
esbs
so
i
thought
id
check
it
out
surprised
its
not
really
an
esb
in
my
opinion
more
of
an
amber
really
but
ill
review
it
anyway
reddish
amber
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
on
it
actually
it
fizzed
right
out
of
the
bottle
smell
is
pretty
light
but
theres
some
nice
doughy
malty
notes
and
some
prescence
of
herbal
hops
and
a
bit
dusty
the
taste
is
very
mellow
much
as
it
smells
but
the
hops
are
even
more
subdued
nice
warm
wheaty
and
barlyish
flavor
with
a
soft
malty
palate
but
not
at
all
normal
for
the
esb
style
a
little
toffee
maybe
reminiscent
of
the
english
style
esbs
but
like
i
said
if
this
was
an
amber
i
would
be
totally
pleased
with
it
but
this
beer
isnt
bitter
at
all
whats
the
deal
this
esb
is
a
beautiful
medium
copper
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
mostly
diminishing
head
and
some
lacing
early
the
aroma
is
rather
light
some
toasted
malts
and
a
little
floral
hops
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
from
an
esb
theres
also
some
sort
of
herbal
aroma
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
taste
is
smooth
and
mild
more
grainy
than
hoppy
but
it
has
a
nice
crisp
but
short
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
good
slightly
oily
maybe
medium
body
soft
carbonation
surprisingly
good
though
this
beer
isnt
anything
that
wow
you
and
i
dont
think
it
is
a
good
representation
of
its
style
however
it
is
a
wellrounded
beer
that
is
very
inviting
i
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
nicely
with
a
thin
and
delicate
tan
head
the
red
amber
color
is
pleasing
as
is
the
odor
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
not
extra
specially
bitter
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
the
hops
rounded
out
well
the
scarlet
lady
has
a
good
consistency
but
is
a
little
too
bubbly
i
like
a
woman
who
is
a
bit
more
reserved
this
could
be
due
to
the
bottle
overall
a
solid
beer
with
excellent
value
1bottle
but
then
again
i
live
30
minutes
from
the
brewery
goes
well
with
a
meal
or
on
its
own
and
is
a
good
choice
in
general
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
above
the
copper
brew
head
exhibits
reasonable
retention
with
averagetogood
lacing
aroma
is
sweetly
malty
with
little
hops
character
evident
taste
continues
in
the
same
vein
with
the
balance
leaning
towards
grain
an
oddity
for
an
esb
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
okay
but
in
this
brews
case
the
maltiness
just
limits
the
easeofdrinking
factor
a
bit
an
acceptable
brew
that
seems
miscategorized
but
its
hard
to
switch
when
esb
is
in
its
name
basically
if
you
like
bass
ale
then
this
should
be
a
good
choice
in
comparison
the
scarlet
lady
is
less
carbonated
and
more
hoppy
then
bass
but
strikingly
similar
for
the
most
part
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
at
the
start
and
finish
the
toasted
caramel
tones
linger
briefly
a
decent
brew
that
could
be
better
with
a
touch
more
bitterness
this
is
a
beautiful
clear
amber
colored
liquid
with
a
moderate
tan
head
the
nose
is
dominantly
of
toasted
malts
theres
a
subtle
hop
floralness
in
the
background
framed
with
a
dough
and
crackerlike
smell
the
aroma
is
not
particularly
strong
but
its
solid
and
stable
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
balanced
very
nicely
with
the
hops
the
toasted
character
stands
out
in
the
taste
with
a
little
nut
and
fruit
it
all
comes
together
as
a
very
drinkable
beer
an
outstanding
session
brew
carbonation
is
pretty
high
which
i
thought
detracted
from
the
excellent
taste
and
lowered
the
drinkability
pours
out
a
ambercopper
color
with
some
nice
carbonation
visible
and
stays
with
you
a
good
amount
of
time
smell
consisted
of
malts
mostly
some
toasted
aromas
hung
around
in
the
backround
some
hops
and
citrus
aromas
hang
around
in
the
background
as
well
but
faint
compared
to
the
other
aromas
taste
was
ok
malts
toffee
and
toasted
flavors
show
up
with
some
hops
kicking
in
the
middle
and
finishes
on
the
dry
side
not
a
bad
example
by
any
means
but
this
needed
a
little
more
bitterness
to
it
afterall
its
called
an
extra
special
bitter
but
not
bad
for
a
session
beer
it
pours
a
creamy
copper
amber
with
a
slightly
tan
well
carbonated
head
that
fades
quick
lace
in
spots
at
best
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
strawberry
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
toffee
with
a
thick
over
the
top
buttery
toasted
malt
i
find
little
to
no
bitterness
or
hop
to
balance
this
beer
i
find
the
drinkability
hard
for
its
just
too
sweet
my
scorenot
inpressed
by
this
lady
poured
out
a
great
amber
color
there
is
alot
going
on
in
that
glass
millions
of
floater
like
sediment
shooting
around
this
bottle
was
shared
and
the
pourer
did
not
think
to
even
out
the
pour
and
we
had
a
fun
experience
in
that
my
glass
caught
the
sediment
and
another
was
clear
the
amount
of
yeasty
taste
was
sooo
different
between
the
2
glasses
also
lesson
learned
very
balanced
brew
and
very
very
tastey
and
nicely
sweet
but
not
overly
so
juicey
finish
medium
bodied
needs
to
bring
in
some
more
bittering
hop
to
equal
the
aroma
and
taste
of
the
beers
that
came
in
my
stoudt
variety
case
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
or
at
least
tied
with
the
american
pale
ale

goes
quickly
and
leaves

color
medium

1
40
for
a
12oz
bottle
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
malt
body
and
an
additional
dose
of
dry
hops
this
beer
has
a
great
feel
to
it
when
you
are
drinking
it
this
is
defiantly
the
best
esb
that
i
have
had
yet
this
esb
has
the
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
it
isnt
too
bitter
its
just
right
the
head
that
you
get
when
you
pour
it
out
is
there
but
it
isnt
too
great
as
for
the
aroma
nice
and
strong
when
i
first
opened
this
bottle
up
i
just
knew
that
it
would
be
good
after
i
showed
this
to
my
buddy
who
loves
esbs
this
is
for
the
most
part
the
only
esb
that
he
drinks
now
this
is
highly
recommendable
colorful
bottle
pours
a
nice
amber
with
little
head
but
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
this
starts
sort
of
crisp
and
light
then
the
hoppiness
kicks
in
it
is
a
sort
of
cherry
currant
fruit
hoppiness
that
is
mellow
but
certainly
present
this
is
truly
a
session
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
but
has
great
qualities
if
your
looking
for
mega
hops
and
flavor
its
not
here
but
if
you
want
a
quality
drinking
beer
this
is
it
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
not
much
of
a
head
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
but
leaves
attractive
sheets
of
lace
aroma
of
sweet
buttery
malts
floral
hops
balance
and
walnuts
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
minimal
carbonation
and
slightly
watery
taste
lives
up
to
the
bouquets
promise
of
a
fine
esb
excellent
toffee
malt
sweetness
nutty
walnut
superb
mild
hops
bitterness
perhaps
a
bit
of
watered
down
effect
midway
through
but
this
doesnt
distract
from
the
exceptional
flavors
going
on
here
ive
not
been
impressed
with
many
north
american
esbs
but
this
one
reminds
of
the
topnotch
propeller
esb
from
nova
scotia
this
one
has
some
very
minor
flaws
but
taste
and
drinkability
make
this
ale
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
had
from
north
america
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
fine
esbs
this
is
a
transparent
burnt
orange
topped
with
a
small
frothy
head
of
persistent
bubbles
the
aroma
is
an
earthy
hopiness
with
slight
spice
over
a
modest
malt
base
the
first
sip
reveals
a
smooth
lightish
body
with
a
mild
bitterness
quickly
evident
the
hops
only
become
more
prevalent
as
the
finish
brings
a
somewhat
dry
hop
spice
and
maybe
even
a
very
slight
hint
of
a
lightly
toasted
malt
this
dark
ruby
colored
beer
pours
with
an
off
white
head
and
very
notciable
carbonation
the
smell
is
that
of
sweet
and
citrus
hops
with
an
overall
sweetness
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
again
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
smooth
and
mellow
body
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
bitter
as
youd
imagine
with
and
aftertaste
that
is
lightly
bitter
but
the
fruitiness
takes
over
and
leaves
the
hops
overshadowed
my
only
wish
it
that
it
was
a
bit
more
bitter
but
its
still
a
nice
brew
taste
wise
it
starts
off
with
a
fair
amount
of
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
a
toastednutty
flavor
the
middle
seems
somewhat
sweeter
in
the
diacetyl
kind
of
way
smooth
and
buttery
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
hoppy
a
well
rounded
brew
id
like
to
have
a
few
more
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
there
are
plenty
of
floaties
here
the
aroma
is
clean
hoppy
and
full
of
malty
character
it
smells
of
roasted
pale
and
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
boasts
of
bitterness
along
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
which
means
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
is
good
tasting
and
has
an
even
better
mouthfeel
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
drinking
esb
a
good
beer
just
isnt
blowing
me
away
very
easy
drinking
and
something
i
think
i
will
come
back
to
the
taste
is
well
balanced
lightly
malted
to
begin
finishing
to
a
light
bitter
the
substance
of
the
taste
comes
to
an
abrupt
halt
leaving
you
wanting
some
continuence

is
quite
full
and

this

got
a
nice
little

to
it
and
some

as
well
the
taste
is
quite
subtle
toffee

backbone
is
sufficient
very
slight
diactyl
a
little
fruitiness
dryness
on
the
finish
and
just
a
little
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
slick
easy
going
mouthfeel
medium
body
decent
enough
bitter
id
guess
more
like
a
bitter
than
an
esb
though
the
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
reddish
color
to
it
with
a
slight
haze
there
is
a
small
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
that
of
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
to
it
there
is
a
good
malty
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
a
pretty
decent

than
it
is
in
the
12oz
bottle
very
nice

the
nose
had
a
really
nice
sweet
biscuity
smell
with
a
real
nice
malty
base
and
floural
hop
hint
taste
seemed
a
bit
subdued
on
the
hop
side
for
an
esb
nice
malty
flavors
but
nothing
jumped
ouit
at
me
hop
flavors
were
very
tame
with
some
mild
floural
undertones
there
were
tiny
particulates
sitting
in
suspension
in
the
entire
beer
not
sure
what
that
was
all
about
overall
not
very
complex
and
i
was
hopping
to
have
more
of
a
hop
element
very
quaffable
and
a
down
right
solid
brew
i
personally
like
my
esbs
to
have
a
big
and
bold
fresh
hop
character
sadly
this
one
did
not
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
sufficient
flavoring
and
great
drinkability
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
is
well
under
control
for
those
nonhopheads
out
there
the
sweet
flavors
from
the
malts
balances
very
well
there
is
certainly
nothing
amazing
about
this
beer
but
it
is
definitely
a
solid
brew
it
is
above
average
in
every
aspect
and
it
is
therefore
a
good
one
to
drink
sometimes
i
really
dont
know
what
to
expect
from
esbs
just
inconsitence
in
taste
i
suppose
pours
nicely
looks
like
yuengling
lager
dont
ask
oddly
enough
it
has
a
crisp
clean
taste
with
more
malts
then
hops
present
imo
it
has
a
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
flavor
very
crisp
through
and
through
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
sit
down
with
and
relax
need
to
try
some
more
cheers
brown
12oz

colorful
with
no

on
dating
the
color
poured
out
a
cloudy
deep
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
the
18
inch
head
dissipated
almost
immediately
maybe
a
bad
pour
the
first
time
but
after
the
6th
one
still
nothing
noteworthy
the
scent
was
of
light
hops
with
a
very
slight
fruit
accent
the
taste
was
bitter
with
a
nice
bite
but
a
very
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
bright
and
crisp
with
a
nice
tingle
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
my
first
real
esb
i
think
i
had
a
petes
esb
before
i
really
started
tasting
beer
it
was
just
bitter
enough
very
crisp
and
clean
and
nice
and
smooth
at
the
tail
end
im
very
interested
in
sampling
some
of
the
other
stoudts
creations
soon
this
one
is
a
keeper
and
i
will
continue
to
explore
esbs
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
a
good
all
around
beer
to
have
in
the
house
when
you
just
want
to
drink
a
brew
well
a
little
confusing
i
think
this
beer
may
be
mislabeled
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
color
was
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
odd
oily
perhaps
i
couldnt
pinpoint
it
taste
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
with
no
hop
burst
or
maltiness
somewhat
neutral
but
not
balanceddue
to
lack
of
hoppiness
or
maltiness
mouthfeel
was
good
smooth
drinkability
was
ok
no
pronounced
aftertaste
smooth
once
again
not
a
bad
brew
but
as
others
have
said
not
an
esb
thanks
to
nerofiddled
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
an
impressive
head
the
aroma
is
distinctly
of
sweet
chocolate
malt
the
initial
glug
settles
a
smooth
medium
body
along
the
palate
with
a
mellow
malty
character
the
mild
bitterness
is
very
mellow
and
pairs
nicely
with
the
malt
presence
and
a
floral
hop
spice
the
brew
stays
smooth
right
through
a
sweet
flush
toward
the
last
few
sips
and
a
nice
clean
finish
this
ale
poured
a
clear
dark
redamber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
caramel
malt
odd
for
an
esb
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
with
caramel
malt
a
dominant
flavor
but
balanced
with
a
good
shot
of
bitter
hops
and
some
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
a
bit
chalky
from
the
hops
with
otherwise
smooth
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
the
aftertaste
was
dry
and
hoppy
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
more
like
a
redamber
ale
than
an
esb
still
decent
though
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
red
color
that
had
some
light
orange
tones
to
it
when
held
to
the
light
the
beer
was
well
carbonated
from
opening
to
last
pour
it
produced
a
light
beigeoff
white
head
that
started
off
fairly
thick
then
fell
to
a
small
layer
and
a
ring
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
that
lasted
o
the
last
sip
and
produced
a
somewhat
watery
lace
in
parts
of
the
glass
the
aromas
were
on
the
light
side
but
were
noticeable
i
nosed
sweet
malt
flowers
hops
light
fruit
in
parts
grains
and
bread
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
pronounced
then
the
aromas
tastes
of
hops
flowers
sweet
malt
caramel
barley
grain
light
fruits
and
bread
were
all
present
and
became
more
noticeable
as
it
warmed
it
left
a
light
hop
aftertaste
in
the
first
few
sips
then
it
became
more
bread
like
as
it
warmed
it
was
light
to
medium
bodied
a
slightly
bitter
slightly
hoppy
slightly
sweet
and
creamy
beer
all
these
were
evident
from
the
opening
of
the
cap
to
the
last
sip
in
the
bottle
was
not
the
kind
of
beer
to
get
if
you
were
looking
for
tons
of
flavors
but
not
a
bad
representative
of
the
style
and
a
drinkable
beer
had
a
thin
body
but
a
true
nut
core
to
it
as
a
good
esb
should
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
tasted
and
felt
like
a
true
english
ale
cask
and
all
but
it
did
feel
like
it
was
coming
close
to
the
end
of
its
quick
halflife
i
applaud
stoudts
effort
at
an
esb
casking
and
making
something
special
for
monks
cafe
pa
wow
first
i
must
say
that
this
beer
on
cask
improves
it
so
much
i
have
had
in
the
bottle
on
tap
but
on
cask
this
is
a
different
animal
alltogether
appears
copper
amber
with
an
off
white
toffee
toned
head
leaving
full
even
wonderful
rings
of
lace
around
my
pint
aroma
is
heavenly
with
buttered
kent
goldings
the
mixture
of
the
malts
they
use
with
the
english
hops
in
this
english
style
ale
blend
to
form
one
full
inviting
aroma
the
tste
is
mellow
with
hops
and
rich
with
mallt
yet
it
remains
hoppy
just
not
to
hoppy
very
balanced
session
brew
that
i
is
a
treat
to
all
very
creamy
silky
texture
to
it
with
the
oily
resins
trickling
lightly
on
the
palate
giving
this
medium
bodied
true
to
the
style
esb
one
amazing
mouthfeel
wow
i
could
have
easily
had
at
least
three
of
these
wonderful
creations
great
representation
of
an
awesome
style
thanks
carol
i
was
impressed
with
the
apa
so
i
figured
id
give
the
scarlet
lady
a
try
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
fair
bit
of
head
the
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
wheat
and
flower
and
simply
smells
wonderful
fortunately
the
taste
of
the
beer
doesnt
disappoint
either
the
original
taste
fades
into
a
lovely
bitter
wheat
aftertaste
i
could
certainly
have
more
than
one
of
these
if
i
wasnt
testing
as
it
seems
to
overwhelm
the
pallette
with
flavor
id
buy
another
of
these
any
day
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
well
retained
medium
headsmell
was
sweet
and
malty
and
biscuity
really
appetizing
on
the
palatemalty
with
a
touch
of
friuty
hopending
with
a
very
biscuity
quality
firsy
beer
from
stoudts
and
was
not
let
downi
really
think
iam
gonna
enjoy
this
areas
selection
of
beers
quite
a
handsome
brew
dark
amber
to
copper
that
is
quite
hazy
or
lightly
cloudy
and
capped
by
a
very
nice
golden
tan
head
the
head
diminishes
fairly
slowly
and
leaves
nice
deposits
of
lace
the
nose
starts
quite
caramel
malty
from
the
robust
head
but
hops
poke
through
as
the
head
weakens
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
between
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
hop
bitterness
a
pleasant
refreshing
brew
that
starts
well
and
ends
well
just
a
tad
thin
on
the
body
but
still
crisp
enough
good
for
a
go
or
two
poured
a
nice
ambercopper
in
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
fruit
and
lighlty
toasted
malt
flavor
was
that
of
caramel
malt
with
a
nice
bitterness
but
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
liked
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
watery
for
my
liking
but
was
not
too
far
off
very
enjoyable
and
an
interesting
label
to
boot
hazy
copper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
mild
hop
flowery
and
caremel
malt
aroma
caremel
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
mild
hop
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
creamy
soft
mouthfeel
fishes
with
a
very
dry
bitterness
not
a
bad
esb
imho
not
the
best
still
drinkable
the
aroma
is
a
perfect
balance
of
malts
and
hops
i
got
a
mild
floral
aroma
upon
sniffing
this
one
along
with
a
fruity
raspberry
aroma
the
taste
initially
is
nearly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
caramel
malt
flavor
as
well
as
some
mild
fruit
flavoring
which
is
delicious
the
hops
dont
seem
to
hit
until
after
i
swallow
then
they
seem
to
bite
down
nicely
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
very
nice
balanced
brew
pretty
amber
color
with
a
thin
but
creamy
offwhite
head
and
minimal
lace
mildly
bitter
hops
aroma
the
flavor
was
not
as
bitter
as
some
but
does
have
a
nicely
sweet
malt
presence
an
interesting
esb
to
say
the
least
scarlet
lady
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
offwhitelight
tan
head
this
is
a
very
attractive
lady
tgere
are
some
nice
hops
aromas
mixed
with
malt
sweetness
not
as
strong
aromas
as
some
ales
but
its
a
very
nice
perfume
the
lady
wears
she
plays
somewhat
hardto
get
with
the
flavor
i
can
taste
some
nice
hops
and
then
a
bit
of
malt
jumps
in
some
mouthfuls
are
sweeter
than
others
but
i
would
not
call
this
a
sweet
beer
she
has
a
wonderful
bitter
finish
and
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
stoudts
produces
yet
another
good
beer
definitely
a
nice
lady
to
spend
an
evening
with
5kd
after
all
this
weeks
discussion
of
growlers
bombersand
minikegs
i
have
to
start
with
a
765ml
bottle
direct
from
the
brewery
pours
a
bright
red
copper
with
gold
highlights
a
lively
free
form
off
white
head
which
settles
down
fine
carbonation
a
very
strong
fruity
nose
highlighted
by
apples
and
pears
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
some
butter
and
just
enough
hops
to
give
it
balance
wonderful
full
rich
body
very
british
could
easily
do
another
bomber
of
this
in
a
sitting
extra
special
indeed
she
is
quite
a
lady
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
some
buttery
diacetyl
with
absolutely
no
hops
the
brew
start
off
sweet
and
creamy
and
then
goes
into
a
buttery
flavor
but
never
manages
to
show
me
even
one
hop
flower
the
lack
of
bitterness
kills
the
balance
of
this
brew
smooth
and
chewy
the
lack
of
any
bitterness
makes
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
sticky
and
cloying
as
well
and
brings
down
the
drinkability
some
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
definitely
needs
to
find
some
balance
after
the
good
reviews
this
esb
had
received
i
was
somewhat
excited
to
try
it
and
to
be
honest
it
let
me
down
i
will
probably
try
it
again
but
not
for
quite

is

the

amazingly
english

are
fairly
mild

lend
some
supercomplex

while
the

beckons

this

and
fans
of

should
definitely
give
it
a

going

misnomer
of
being
called
bitter

in

these
are
sweeter
grain
driven
beers
perhaps
in
my
case
bitter
has
a
very
different
more
diabolical
meaning
it
was
brew
that
started
as
a
celebration
of
a
big
win
in
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
last
night
guzzling
the
sweet
copper
colored
liquid
right
from
the
bottle
in
jovial
preparation
for
what
was
sure
to
be
a
winnable
game
7
forthcoming
to
me
it
was
a
beer
that
would
taste
awful
good
out
of
the
cup
itself
in
a
few
more
months
however
as
the
aromas
of
burnt
sugar
english
toffee
and
old
world
ale
yeast
moved
into
flavors
of
maple
syrup
candied
apples
and
werthers
candies
the
unthinkable
happened
the
home
team
gives
up
two
goals
in
the
final
two
minutes
and
lost
early
in
overtime
a
situation
that
had
less
than
a
0
4
chance
of
occurring
as
jubilation
turned
to
head
in
hands
curses
to
the
powers
that
be
and
soft
goaltending
anvil
esb
went
from
a
celebratory
quaff
to
a
sorrow
drowning
full
bodied
sweet
beer
i
almost
resented
as
much
as
i
liked
it
to
start
and
as
a
playoff
beard
that
began
on

and
razor
burn
irritation
set
in
the
final
lukewarm
dregs
of
this
beer
were
of
little
comfort
this
beer
like
the
play
of
my
team
was
good
for
some
95
of
its
performance
but
it
ends
up
middling
by
the
end
an
all
too
frequent
collapse
not
only
for
my
team
but
for
this
underwhelming
style
the
parallels
are
too
many
to
name
22
ounces
never
experienced
to
much
emotion
from
the
summit
of
the
greatest
mount
to
hopeless
dejection
that
will
span
the
entire
summer
overall
a
tasty
beer
not
as
drinkable
as
other
esbs
though
d
insanely
quaffable
a
very
nice
esb
and
another
solid
offering
from
alesmith
there
is
a
reason
i
consider
them
to
be
one
of
the
top
breweries
going
solid
for
the
style
solid
regardless
of
style
just
a
solid

here
with

abv
good
stuff
if
theres
one
thing
i
find
about
bitters
is
they
usually
have
a
good
malt
presence
and
this
one
while
relishing
some
great
herbal
presences
is
really
missing
some
malt
depth
some
depth
or
crackery
or
biscuit
and
caramel
oomph
to
this
would
really
set
this
beer
on
fire
excellent
treat
yourself
overall
alesmith
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
in
my
previous
review
i
damned
alesmiths
ipa
with
faint
praise
this
beer
however
is

a
tang
to
it
that
i
would
describe
as
faintly
metallic
sweet

fruity
in
the
mouth
british
malts
are
fairly
subtle
lending
some
caramel
and
slight
breadiness
lots
of

to
be
the
dominant
set
of
flavors
here
oily
texture
that
coats
the
tongue
some
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
they
dont
show
up
strong
in
the

profile
id
like
it
better
with
more

less

and
maybe
even
a

mileage
may
vary

it
off
has
a
character
reminiscent
to
me
a
bit
of
a

heavy
mouthfeel
was
much
to
thick
and
syrupy
for
me
and
did
not
suit
the
style
well
mild
carbonation
and
my
mouth
was
left
feeling
sticky
o

for
an

a

between
an
english
porter
and
a
belgian
dubbel
the
smoky
porter
taste
which
dominates
later
is
pleasant
enough
but
lacks
the
malt
dominance
one
might
expect
from
an
esb
probably
the
issue
is
a
combination
of
bottle
conditioning
and
age
on
the
bottle
where
the
remaining
yeast
eventually
bore
some
unintended
fruity
esters
ill
try
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
and
give
this
another
whirl
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
darker
amber
color
accompanied
by
a
small
offwhite
head
maybe
1
finger
which
was
not
well
retained
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
sweet
toasted
malt
aroma
that
was
balanced
nicely
with
some
earthy
hops
very
nice
if
only
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
the
beer
was
much
maltier
than
expected
i
expected
much
more
balance
but
it
was
a
nice
bready
malt
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
toasted
malt
the
beer
did
have
a
really
nice
feel
medium
body
smooth
creamy
and
very
drinkable
overall
i
think
that
i
need
to
give
this
one
a
shot
again
but
from
this
tasting
it
was
not
bad
medium
bodied
with
slightly
below
normal
carbonation
there
is
a
toasted
malt
and
caramel
aftertaste
this
is
a
well
made
beer
as
all
alesmith
beers
are
and
i
would
buy
this
again
i
just
wish
there
was
more
complexity
poured
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
nice
ring
offwhite
that
left
good
lacing
quite
nice
scents
of
sweet
caramel
malt
honey
light
toasty
notes
and
hints
of

appealing

earthy

moderate
floral

bitterness
slight
toffee
on
the
finish
and
aftertaste
also
some
grain
husk
on
the
aftertaste
a
very
good
flavor
with
a
bit
going
on
but
not
too
much
that
the
beer
is
overwhelming
it
remains
extremely
drinkable
while
having
a
pleasant
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fitting
an
english
pub
ale
overall
its
an
excellent
session
beer
with
a
good
aroma
flavor
and
drinkability
and
an
excellent
example
of
a
classic
british
style
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
muddled
slightly
hazed
rubyhighlighted
amber
coloring
with
a
frothy
filmy
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
surface
coating
aromas
of
sugary
sweetness
in
front
with
toffee
and
caramel
notes
abound
highlighted
by
hints
of
chocolate
and
an
almost
egg
nog
like
character
very
rich
and
sweet
flavors
of
roast
forward
with
a
strong
nutty
character
blending
with
a
rich
milk
chocolate
profile
very
interesting
very
sweet
and
bitter
balanced
and
a
touch
earthy
an
overall
roasted
character
prevails
with
a
bitter
build
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
combining
with
a
tangy
caramel
highlight
the
body
is
thin
but
robust
and
supportive
of
all
the
flavors
aftertaste
of
tangy
sweet

a
more
toffee
feel
to
it
thin
slightly
cloying
and
lingering

with
a
touch
of
dry
at

not
overly
exciting
but
nicely
executed
anvil
is
an
effortless
ale
thats
well

for
near
sessionable
quality
but
is
sturdy
enough
for
that
decadent

bangers
mash
o

esb
is
an
interesting
take
on
the

from
alesmith
incorporating
a
complex
english

profile
with
subtle
but
clearly
american
hops
nice
and
drinkable
anvil
esb
finishes
smooth
an
instant
favorite
this
beer
keeps
all
its
qualities
in
balance
so
that
none
boast
of
themselves
above
the
others
its
big
hearted
and
natural
with
a
mild
flavor
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
all
day
d
super
drinkable
and
well
made
ale
while
this
is
really
drinkable
and
tasty
it
is
not
particularly
englishy
in
character
i
am
guessing
this
wasnt
made
with
an
english
yeast
strain
and
the
toasty
character
is
a
bit
much
that
being
said
though
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
perfectly
illustrates
the
style
i
recently
had
a
homebrew
from
a
friend
that
was
close
to
this
so
i
was
looking
for
a
sessionable
beer
that
fit
that
mold
very
easy
drinking
beer
def
check
it
out
ive
been
avoiding
reviewing
this
beer
for
years
and
tonight
i
figured
lets
give
it
a
shot
i
guess
the
fact
that
alesmith
is
finally
putting
a
date
on
the
bottle
is
why
i
was
willing
to
pick
it
up
i
could
trust
it
wasnt
like
2
years
old
or
something
like
that
in
the
end
i
wasnt
too
impressed
the
vegetal
notes
are
a
bit
offputting
and
overall
its
just
not
well
rounded
enough
to
score
highly
considering
this
is
5
a
bomber
i
would
much
rather
get
a
sixer
of
gi
honkers
or
something
like
that
worth
a
try
peace
o
the
nice
clean
easy
drinking
session
beer
has
a
good
hop
profile
and
a
nice
fresh
dry
malt
character
to
boot
even
though
it
was
a
large
bottle
it
didnt
last
long
o
a
malt
forward
bready
beer
with
a
mild
bitterness
it
lacks
the
english
funky
yeast
but
it
is
a
good
american
interpretation
of
the
style
a
well
done
esb
enjoyable
though
fairly
standard
flavor

for
the
style

the

excellent

im
super
excited
that
alesmith
is
now
available
30mins
from
home
last
time
i
had
one
from
this
brewery
i
ordered
it
online
their
ipa
crisp
clean
very
drinkable
it
is
watery
refreshing
up
front
with
a
bitter
bite
in
the
back
that
leaves
your
mouth
tingling
for
more
as
it
warms
some
toffee
sweet
malt
notes
come
out
to
give
a
little
balance
to
the
bitter
dominance
the
pine
lemon
and
bitter
herb
hit
simultaneously
with
one
punch
a
very
interesting
beer
fun
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
notes
strikes
a
strong
balance
between
powerful
malts
and
complex
hops
this
is
a
bold
risk
taking
delicious
beer
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
beer
is
wonderful
all
round
rich
complex
flavor
that
are
well
developed
i
really
wish
i
had
more
of
these
beer
in
my

because
i
could
see
me
drinking

there

ordered
3
alesmith
beers
from
letspour
this
is
just
outstanding
c
i
havent
had
an
esb
in
a
while
so
this
is
a
treat
to
behold
nofrills
easy
drinking
not
too
high
in
abv
either
the
flavor
mimics
the
taste
incredibly
well
with
big
emphases
on
toasted
almonds
and
cashews
smooth
and
surprising
light
with
a
medium
carbonation
level
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
completely
satisfying
this
is
a
pretty
good
ale
better
its
counterfactual
as
a
lager
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
its
quality
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
but
im
really
not
a
fan
of
this
really
biscuity
malt
bill
overall
pretty
solid
esb
fullers
and
hobglobin
i
have
had
a
lot
but
happy
to
add
this
one
to
the
mix
overal
an
enjoyable
if
not
exception
esb
theres
a
decent
chance
ill
buy
it
again
o
a
nice
esb
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
pours

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild

on
the

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
beer
seems
more
flavorful
and
fullerbodied
compared
to
other
esbs
but
it
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
m
medium
bodied
brew
low
abv
i
assume
anvil
ale
esb
is
a
really
nice
release
from
alesmith
brewing
company
it
really
is
a
tasty
representation
of
the
style
if
it
has
any
shortcomings
the
nose
could
use
a
little
more
strength
thats
about
it
its
impressive
otherwise
definitely
worth
checking
out
doa
while
the
aroma
and
taste
are
not
overwhelmingly
exciting
this
beer
is
absurdly
quaffable
especially
for
the
style
i
was
not
necessarily
planning
on
drinking
this
bomber
in
one
sitting
but
its
definitely
going
to
happen
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
an
exceptionally
crafted
beer
and
great
complexity
of
flavor
for
such
a
drinkable
low
abv
beer
buy
it
if
you
see
it
overall
not
bad
better
than
i
expected
i
kinda
put
this
one
off
for
a
little
while
as
i
was
afraid
it
would
have
that
herbal
u
k
like
hop
that
i
dont
like
in
most
esbs
decent
grainy
malts
nice
grassy
hops
a
bit
floral
earthy
and
tasty
without
too
much
bitterness
or
sweetness
overall
nice
complex
and
malty
esb
i
scored
this
according
to
style
and
this
is
probably
my
favorite
in
the
style
if
nothing
else
it
is
my
favorite
bottle
from
alesmith
in
this
bottle
size
i
will
get
this
again
if
not
marking
to
style
this
would
probably
be
about
a
3
8
overall
is
very
good
quaffable
and
tasty
another
solid
brew
from
alesmith
yep
thats
a
bitter
thats
what
struck
my
mind
at
the
very
start
with
this
beer
and
its
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
decent
citrus
and
woodyleafy
tones
ill
say
that
it
seems
mildly
clogged
and
almost
too
thick
on
the
body
but
the
whole
thing
does
work
cant
really
say
it
isnt
worth
trying
naturally
id
be
interested
to
try
this
on
cask
since
visiting
the
alesmith
brewery
back
in
summer
of
11
i
am
hooked
to
this
brewery
every
beer
is
amazing
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
little
chewy
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
drinkable
tasty
beer
although
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
too
often
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
style
to
say
the
least
the
fact
that
its
american
brewed
is
even
better
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
over
the
course
of
the
22
but
its
never
tedious
drinks
like
a
champ
and
then
some
here
is
an
esb
with
a
touch
of
porter
lots
cocoa
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
as
one
should
expect
for
the
style
o
nice
esb
perhaps
the
best
one
ive
had
nutty
and
toasty
like
a
brown
hoppy
like
an
epa
all
while
coming
in
at
only
5
5
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
i
like
the
great
malty
flavor
the
body
is
light
with
somewhat
prickly
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
tasty
one
real
enjoyable
odanything
i
have
tried
by
alesmith
is
a
blast
for
me
speedway
stout
and
their
ipa
are
among
the
peaks
of
their
respective
styles
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
exceptional
esb
and
6
for
a
bomber
is
not
a
ludicrous
price
either
success
o
a
very
tasty
very
drinkable
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
really
tasty
example
of
a
style
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
barely
consider
these
days
in
the
world
of
hyperhopping
a
nice
change
of
pace
really
well
made
as
it
seems
is
everything
alesmith
does
overall
nice
esb
but
too
carbonated
in
the
bottle
which
threw
things
off
a
bit
and
added
unnecessary
carbonic
prickliness
and
bite
another
bottle
properly
conditioned
could
change
my
mind
enjoyable
esb

this

it

is
the
perfect
counterpoint
to
the

everyday
i
want
this
everyfreakinday
tastes
like
a
very
dilute
amber
ale
i
get
too
much
of
the
dishwater
taste
for
this
to
be
enjoyable
o
middle
of
the
road
bitter
that
doesnt
have
enough
malt
or
balance
for
my
taste
too
bitter
and
dry
for
me
also
lacks
depth
overall
i
enjoyed
the
doughy
fruitiness
this
beer
offered
really
solid
esb
in
my
opinion
but
more
of
a
heavy
americanized
version
than
a
crisp
bitter
traditional
english
version
good
but
not
monumental
worth
a
go
if
you
stumble
across
it
but
my
favorite
domestic
esb
is
still
the
tallgrass
version
a
good
beer
overall
and
one
i
could
keep
going
back
to
over
an
evening
a
good
esb
but
far
from
alesmiths
best
offering
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
aroma
is
floral
hops
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
wellbalanced
but
not
incredibly
interesting
caramel
malt
and
a
sourbitter
finish
with
some
citrusy
hops
smooth
palate
medium
body
o
like
most
alesmith
beers
really
solid
stuff
i
could
have
used
a
little
less
sweetness
but
the
beer
was
still
enjoyable
from
notes
21009
good
except
for
a
sweet
medicinal
off
note
caramel
malt
dominates
the
flavor
hops
are
evident
and
chime
in
with
floralmetallicearthy
aromas
and
flavors
more
refined
and
british
than
any
other
san
diego
area
beer
that
ive
tried
the
bitterness
is
excellent
but
the
medicinal
note
just
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
enjoy
the
beer
fully
i
might
try
to
grab
a
second
bottle
to
see
if
i
got
an
off
example
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
decent
white
head
feel
is
smooth
and
fairly
round
t
pretty
interesting
very
mellow
but
good
the
taste
starts
with
some
hop
bitterness
but
before
the
bitterness
can
peak
some
malts
come
in
with
some
toffee
and
rye
bread
the
carbonation
is
really
interesting
i
wouldnt
call
it
prickly
more
like
tingly
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
amazing
anvil
esb
certainly
drops
a
ton
of
flavour
considering
its
a
beer
designed
with
quaffability
in
mind
indeed
rather
than
rush
through
it
i
actually
took
my
time
with
the
bottle
and
savored
each
and
every
one
of
the
22
ounces
growing
more
and
more
enamored
with
it
as
the
glass
emptied
although
more
bitter
than
most
it
is
still
as
pleasant
a
beer
than
any
other
o
overall
not
at
all
what
i
expected
of
this
beer
though
i
have
only
had
a
couple
of
other
esbs
so
perhaps
this
is
what
they
should
be
like
definitely
unique
but
a
little
too
astringent
and
fruity
for
me
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
acidic
beverages
dont
sit
well
in
my
stomach
perhaps
im
just
not
in
the
mood
for
this
one
moouthfeel
relatively
thin
but
intense
hops
require
a
break
for
air
between
sips
o
very
good
not
especially
exciting
but
very
solid
rich
and
creamy
very
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
yields
about
a
finger
of
deep
tan
foam
high
percentage
of
larger
bubbles
results
in
a
swift
dissipation
to
scattered
islands
across
the
surface
the
lacing
too
slick
and
crystalline
to
cling
to
the
glass
walls
deep
bronzed
color
reddishbrown
until
a
bright
orange
develops
at
the
glass
bottom
trim
with
a
mild
translucent
blurring
rivulets
of
tiny
active
bubbles
along
the
insides
the
nose
barely
betrays
any
bitterness
a
novice
would
be
confused
by
the
category
name
all
softer
malts
and
caramel
butterscotch
heavy
cream
milk
chocolate
buttermilk
biscuits
and
nuts
nearer
to
room
temperature
you
get
peat
and
earth
accents
and
a
lifting
florality
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
works
hard
to
prevent
things
from
congealing
and
for
the
most
part
succeeds
that
said
it
is
not
a
thirst
quenching
refreshing
quaff
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
chocolate
butterscotch
joined
here
by
fig
raisin
cherry
apricot
fruit
flavors
the
nuttiness
likewise
has
more
of
a
candied
than
roasted
nature
the
floral
notes
swell
in
the
middle
then
segue
into
mineral
water
earth
grass
still
no
sense
waiting
on
any
bitterness
as
its
not
really
coming
as
a
quality
beer
its
tasty
enough
does
wear
you
down
some
through
the
second
pint
not
sure
its
a
classic
esb
i
love
when
an
american
brewer
nails
a
foreign
style
and
this
is
just
what
alesmith
did
a
perfect
example
of
an
esb
do
fresh
anvil
is
not
extreme
but
it
is
a
real
treat
because
it
is
a
relatively
rare
style
of
pale
ale
that
is
done
well
and
even
bottled
there
is
no
attempt
to
adapt
or
spin
it
into
being
some
bastardized
californiaversion
of
the
style
this
is
a
dark
and
traditional
rendition
featuring
the
best
that
the
english
ingredients
have
to
offer
careful
craftsmanship
is
also
evident
in
the
general
cleanliness
of
the
sensory
profile
particularly
the
lack
of
diacetyl
and
also
little
in
the
way
of
esters
it
strikes
a
favorable
balance
often
missed
by
the
finest
of
american
ales
being
a
natural
compliment
to
a
wide
variety
of
foods
yet
still
hoppy
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
i
only
review
it
now
because
i
am
tired
of
waiting
and
hoping
to
encounter
it
on
cask
another
brewery
ive
never
tried
before
anyway
with
a
very
gentle
pour
it
pours
a
cherry
redlight
mahogany
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
doesnt
really
leave
a
head
at
all
its
more
one
frothy
island
right
in
the
middle
and
no
lacingthe
smell
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
cherrycaramellight
toffee
and
medicinal
hopsit
has
a
lightmedium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
but
in
my
mind
lacks
a
little
backbone
and
has
tastes
of
dark
cherriescaramel
fudgesticky
toffeelight
liquorice
and
finishes
with
a
medicinalherbal
hoppy
bitterness
and
overall
its
a
nice
enterpretation
of
an
english
esb
but
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
just
abit
more
from
this
brew
cheers
i
admittedly
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
the
restrained
flavors
are
a
nice
change
to
the
overhopped
west
coast
beers
im
used
to
the
minerality
gives
this
a
unique
twist
not
great
but
doesnt
disappoint
overall
an
easy
drinking
esb
that
is
well
made
but
not
something
i
would
go
for
that
often
i
would
love
to
see
a
bit
more
hoppiness
to
balance
out
the
nice
malt
character
d
overall
alesmith
anvil
esb
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
a
shot
recommended
overall
a
very
good
esb
that
was
highly
drinkable
the
mouth
feel
was
lacking
something
i
couldnt
my
finger
on
it
but
it
was
still
an
above
average
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
esbs
seek
this
one
out
simple
direct
tasty
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
pretty
sure
i
could
put
this
entire
bomber
down
in
under
ten
minutes
very
good
beer
d
good
beer
if
was
served
around
here
i
would
drink
honestly
i
could
session
this
beer
all
day
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
your
interest
overall
not
really
a
fan
of
this
style
so
not
one
i
regularly
drink
but
i
did
like
the
all
english
version
of
this
they
did
d
at
this
abv
and
no
palate
killers
in
the
mix
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
d
an
easy
drinking
quaffable
beer

d
a
while
ago
i
made
the
mistake
of
comparing
every
bitter
to
east
ends
bitter
end
the
2nd
running
of
gratitude
and
so
very
few
have
been
able
to
meet
the
complexity
and
straight
up
great
taste
this
is
no
different
anvil
is
a
pedestrian
attempt
at
a
pedestrian
style
d
a
pretty
good
esb
but
not
my
favorite
had
some
nice
caramel
and
bready
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
would
try
again
alesmith
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
by
far
and
im
glad
to
get
around
to
rate
some
of
their
beers
can
barely
put
a
pint
of
this
down
not
very
exciting
grabbed
a
bomber
from
bevmo
in
west
hollywood
for
4
or
5
the
beer
looks
slightly
hazy
and
amberred
with
a
tall
head
and
lacing
honestly
i
cant
get
much
aroma
from
this
most
of
the
time
but
as
it
warms
i
get
hints
of
pine
sweet
cherries
and
toast
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
robust
theres
a
bready
caramel
malt
backbone
with
drier
toffee
notes
on
top
and
mild
spicy
hop
finish
this
is
a
great
session
beer
unlike
most
american
red
or
americanmade
esbs
the
body
is
light
while
it
still
packs
a
flavorful
punch
m
d
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
smooth
nice
light
body
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
as
well
a
great
drinkable
brew
overall
more
hopcentric
than
i
expected
and
as
a
result
nothing
special
d
this
may
be
authentic
but
it
is
not
very
memorable
a
good
beer
and
it
drinks
decently
well
for
the
style
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
going
on
three
or
four
years
nowafter
having
it
i
feel
maybe
a
little
underwhelmed
poured
into
a
imperial
nonic
a
slight
hazed
copperbronze
with
a
creamylike
light
tan
colored
one
finger
head
that
left
broken
rings
of
lace
as
it
settled
into
a
creamy
mass
aromas
are
the
best
trait
of
the
beerthe
sweet
caramel
really
burst
out
at
yajuicy
fruitinessand
leafy
hop
provide
the
other
elements
seemed
just
a
tad
watery
in
the
mouthnot
earth
shattering
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
rich
as
some
others
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
nice
flavors
but
it
seemed
to
miss
a
punch
in
the
finishstarts
out
fruity
and
deeply
caramellya
pretty
good
shot
of
leafy
hop
rides
thru
the
finishthe
water
gives
that
certain
sulpheric
element
that
iam
not
overly
fond
of
its
a
good
esb
but
there
are
better
american
versionsi
like
a
big
bready
malt
character
to
mine
d
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
it
has
a
good
taste
making
it
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
trying
sometime
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
that
keeps
you
guessing
an
ipa
without
the
heavy
oils
an
herbal
stout
a
cooling
antibelgian
this
is
a
super
piece
of
work
under
the
radar
looking
forward
to
more
from
the
brewers
and
of
this
style
drinkability
while
i
generally
like
the
esb
style
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
burton
beers
and
i
am
afraid
this
one
reminds
me
too
much
of
its
antecedents
wellcrafted
just
not
to
my
taste
d
flavorful
enough
to
need
only
one
yet
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
it
was
a
quite
delicious
beer
since
its
relatively
local
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
to
support
the
southern
california
brewers
chewy
full
malty
body
with
a
prominent
caramel
malt
presence
that
is
slightly
roasty
as
well
as
some
toffee
rye
and
milk
chocolate
character
its
also
pretty
hop
forward
with
a
strong
citrus
peel
presence
and
some
earthy
pine
notes
this
is
quickly
countered
by
the
prominent
malt
profile
but
it
lingers
throughout
into
a
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
pretty
well
balanced
with
a
slightly
more
prominent
hop
profile
kind
of
like
a
roided
up
american
version
of
an
english
esb
22oz
bottle
clear
redbrown
with
a
medium
rocky
offwhite

that
laces
a
little
the
aroma
hit
me
as
a
little
off
a
first
with
a
definite
lemon
iced
tea
character
i
think
its
was
the
yeast
kinda
cool
but
strange
the
flavor
had
a
little
of
the
same
with
subtle
hops
that
balanced
it
out
nicely
some
grape
tartness
too
medium
body
with
ample
but
soft
carbonation
an
odd
esb
but
very
drinkable
and
interesting
at
the
same
time
ill
definitely
get
another
the
next
time
im
down
in
sd
overall
a
very
good
esb
that
i
recommend
if
you
like
the
style
or
are
looking
to
try
one
in
it
for
me
its
good
but
not
something
id
seek
out
that
often
rotation
not
avail
in
tx
so
had
shipped
would
try
again
during
the
brewery
tour
but
no
more
bottles
or
tap
at
bar
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
dogfish
shaped

glass
pours
a
dark
brown
slightly
red
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
very
nice
head
retention
and
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
the
sweet
malts
and
the
english
hops
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
sweetness
of
the
malt
there
is
some
nice
roastedness
and
chocolate
flavore
to
the
malt
to
the
malts
as
well
im
also
getting
some
slight
fruit
characteristics
maybe
some
apple
enjoyable
beer
from
alesmith
as
usual
thank
you
alesmith
however
drink
this
warmer
cellar
temperature
preferably
it
is
an
esb
and
like
most
good
esb
loses
much
of
its
character
when
colder
than
that
d
another
good
showing
from
alesmith
esb
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
generaly

this
is
a

id
easily
go

alesmith
since
im
not
sure
how
to
gauge
them
yet
mouthfeel
is
light
weirdness
of
the
taste
to
me
detracts
from
its
drinkability
maybe
a
few
of
these
spread
out
over
a
couple
weeks
would
help
acquire
a
taste
for
it
but
i
dont
have
that

the

i
get
a
hint
of
peat
in
there
too
medium
bodied
lots
of
flavor
an
esb
for
maltheads
this
is
a
very
good
esb
to
my
mind
an
english
style
the
english
would
be
proud
of
if
theyd
brewed
it
i
think
its
particularly
good
that
the
rowdy
extremebeer
culture
of
american
craft
brewing
takes
a
deep
breath
now
and
again
and
brews
something
like
this
quality
esb
from
alesmith
that
while
it
took
a
bit
to
warm
up
this
offered
some
solid
flavors
and
stayed
easy
drinking
nice
thanks
go
out
to
jgap
for
sending
this
one
to
pa
and
to
psycohops
for
sharing
this
bomber
with
me
we
still
had
a
good
amount
of
sharp
cheddar
left
after
we
finished
a
barley
wine
so
we
figured
wed
see
how
it
fared
up
against
an
esb
poured
into
an
adnams
imperial
pint
glass
the
bitter

need
to

another

hopefully
it
will
not
be
so
high
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
sticky
soft
and
prickley
near
perfect
drinkability
is
good
a
tasty
beer
if
you
like
sweet
english
style
ales
i
do
and
havent
had
a
sweet
brown
ale
in
a
while
theyre
just
not
to
common
here
but
i
really
dig
this
one
luckily
for
this
american
glutton
the
abv
doesnt
reflect
their
goofy
tax
system
or
wait
they
make
weak
beer
for
the
nuance
yea
right
still
theres
no
reason
to
but
this
in
an
overpriced
bomber
a
6
pack
beer
if
i
ever
saw
one
so
minus
5
for
value
do
a
perfect
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
herbal
hops
the
balance
and
backandforth
of
flavors
are
what
kept
me
coming
back
a
highly
quaffable
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
id
love
to
try
this
caskconditioned
the
rollicking
pour
did
hurt
the
overall
score
here
nice
to
see
an
even
balanced
beer
from
a
brewery
known
for
its
more
overthetop
offerings
overall
another
solid
offering
from
alesmith
only
had
two
of
their
beers
so
far
but
im
extremely
impressed
would
definitely
have
again
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
fair
amount
of
lacings
aroma
is
fruity
almost
perfume
like
fruity
taste
with
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
smooth
mouthfeel
perhaps
a
bit
under
carbonated
since
there
is
no
date
on
this
bottle
that
i
can
decipher
and
given
the
good
reviews
that
most
alesmith
products
recieve
i
can
only
assume
this
is
an
old
bottle
overall
fairly
sweet
fruity
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
great
beer
i
enjoyed
this
the
smell
was
that
unique
esb
smell
with
an
american
hop
profile
the
taste
was
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
it
was
juicy
in
the
mouth
and
had
a
good
hop
aroma
on
the
finish
well
crafted
brew
what
i
came
home
to
is
an
extremely
well
balanced
refreshing
beer
ive
been
drinking
an
awful
lot
of
ipa
lately
and
the
break
from
the
extreme
hops
was
lovely
and
yet
the
beer
is
bold
flavorful
memorable
to
me
as
a
beer
that
could
define
what
it
is
to
be
an
esb
i
could
drink
this
beer
very
very
regularly
its
a
perfect
balance
of
the
flavors
that
make
beer
great
maybe
its
been
having
so
many
ipas
russian
imperial
stouts
and
a
few
smoked
porters
that
really
feature
individual
aspects
of
the
beer
and
it
was
incredibly
refreshing
to
have
an
incredibly
well
rounded
flavorful
full
bodied
ale
that
i
picked
for
primarily
for
being
a
southern
california
brewer
that
i
had
not
tried
before
i
will
definitely
buy
alesmith
the
next
time
i
see
it
for
sale
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
tasty
brew
id
gladly
have
again
extremely
easy
to
drink
great
mouthfeel
a
great
offering
by
alesmith
md
nicely
done
brew
evenly
mixed
hops
and
malts
to
make
a
well
balanced
esb
mine
left
way
too
much
foam
and
took
several
pours
just
to
fill
a
glass
what
a
left
field
beer
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
i
really
enjoyed
it
for
being
so
weird
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
an
enjoyable
glass
o
brew
another
solid
beer
from
anvil
to
me
it
isnt
quite
as
impressive
as
its
ipa
brothers
but
still
one
that
id
buy
again
taste
follows
the
nose
touch
of
fruit
and
with
a
nice
malt
finish
firm
carbonation
and
a
good
malt
balance
yield
a
solid
medium
feel
to
the
brew
yet
it
doesnt
have
the
slick
syrupy
finish
that
often
deters
me
from
the
style
perhaps
there
is
hope
for
me
and
the
style
after
a
few
redhook
esbs
sent
me
running
for
a
glucose
meter
in
the
past
quite
drinkable
and
another
fine
brew
from
alesmith
pours
a
darker
copper
with
a
frothy
creamcolored
head
aroma
of
malts
and
yeast
taste
is
a
lighter
esb
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
stong
malt
and
yeast
make
for
a
crisp
bite
with
an
easy
aftertaste
doubles
as
a
great
marinade
for
streaks
and
brats
d
hell
yeah
a
nice
hoppy
american
esb
this
is
a
standout
brew
all
around
a
very
good
beer
not
quite
knocking
my
socks
off
but
im
certainly
happy
to
have
tried
it
notes
from
32605
drinkability
is
fairly
high
this
is
a
tasty
esb
and
certain
sessionable
as
well
as
enjoyable
this
poured
a
copperbrown
with
a
fat
tan
head
and
very
rich
lacing
the
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
slick
and
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
nose
is
of
malts
and
some
pine
hops
very
well
balanced
brew
flavor
is
not
complex
but
enjoyable
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
thie
beer
is
how
drinkable
it
is
it
gets
even
better
as
it
warms
up
dont
drink
this
one
too
cold
pours
a
light
reddish
brown
body
small
light
tannish
head
quickly
diminishing
hoppy
aroma
somewhat
piney
somewhat
maty
but
not
too
strong
malty
piney
acrid
taste
almost
dusty
taste
maybe
some
banana
watery
drinkable
maltiness
more
hops
as
it
warms
up
too
malty
for
my
taste
but
very
drinkable
dark
copper
brown
in
color
one
finger
head
good
retention
and
lacing
on
the
glass
light
aroma
of
hops
but
nothing
is
standing
out
and
in
your
face
on
my
second
pour
from
the
bottle
first
time
down
had
the
bittering
hops
either
they
killed
my
palette
of
i
needed
to
drink
so
water
not
getting
them
anymore
really
smooth
beer
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
without
over
complicating
it
a
good
esb
pours
a
hazy
dark
chestnut
with
an
orange
tinge
and
a
nice
tightly
beaded
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
nice
gentle
aroma
of
biscuity
malt
soft
minerality
and
light
citrus
flavors
the
taste
is
similar
and
pretty
soft
there
is
also
a
bit
of
slightly
grainy
sourness
on
the
end
mellow
and
correctly
carbonated
this
is
decent
for
the
style
but
not
anything
special
pours
clear
amber
with
a
hint
of
red
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
with
little
lacing
the
smell
has
citrus
hops
up
front
with
a
bready
malt
background
and
some
fruity
sweetness
in
there
as
well
the
taste
really
caught
me
off
guard
with
an
immediate
tonguetingling
bitterness
that
actually
has
a
noticeable
lemon
tartness
to
it
there
is
a
strong
spiciness
toward
the
finish
as
well
with
only
a
hint
of
the
bread
behiind
the
massive
bitter
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
strong
carbonation
that
accentuates
the
tartness
the
drinkability
is
limited
a
little
by
the
bitterness
but
this
is
a
decent
bitter
and
a
very
unique
offering
from
alesmith
nice
full
flavor
with
some
bready
malts
and
a
decent
bite
on
the
finish
good
session
beer
d
overall
alesmith
anvil
esb
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
a
shot
recommended
i
love
esbs
and
i
love
alesmith
so
i
figured
the
anvil
esb
would
be
amazing
i
was
sort
of
let
down
i
guess
poured
from
a
22oz
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
bitterness
was
well
hidden
and
i
really
never
found
it
most
domestic
esbs
rival
their
english
counterparts
this
was
very
light
in
flavor
and
in
body
no
real
hop
presence
for
me
very
little
malt
overall
i
was
not
impressed
really
cask
at
ritual
in
sd
fantastic
brew
out
of
cask
was
at
the
brewery
picking
up
some
08
summer
yules
and
learned
a
bit
more
on
how
they
prepare
a
beer
for
cask
conditioning
thanks
for
that
info
alesmith
must
like
the
bottle
but
better
texture
head
was
solid
and
a
bit
tan
very
very
easy
to
drink
there
are
many
good
esbs
out
there
and
unfortunately
this
outstanding
brewery
doesnt
make
one
of
them
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
scant
layer
of
swirly
small
bubbles
over
the
slightly
cloudy
reddish
amber
brew
what
head
there
is
remains
with
sticky
lasting
lace
aroma
is
grain
husks
which
flow
right
into
the
flavor
with
the
maltiness
being
balanced
in
the
middle
by
a
sedate
hopping
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
and
drinkability
is
very
easy
another
nice
offering
from
alesmith
d
very
drinkable
and
a
solid
effort
at
a
real
esb
from
a
nonbritish
brewery
as
with
most
beer
it
goes
better
with
food
happy
drinking
i
will
say
that
i
bought
2
bottles
of
this
and
the
first
bottle
was
not
sealed
correctly
and
had
gone
flat
but
the
flavor
was
fine
ive
noticed
other
reviews
talking
of
off
flavors
etc
alesmith
may
need
to
work
on
some
quality
control
the
tasteof
the
actual
beer
is
a
lot
like
what
i
tasted
in
the
foam
surprise
citrus
that
goes
from
tart
to
just
plain
sour
and
im
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
malt
here
at
all
hey
i
love
sour
ales
but
in
a
brew
thats
supposed
to
be
an
esb
i
dont
think
so
perhaps
this
is
a
bad
bottle
yeah
that
must
be
it
as
i
couldnt
fathom
this
being
what
the
brewer
intended
not
being
locally
available
a
revisit
may
be
a
long
time
coming
im
pouring
the
rest
down
the
drain
this
beauty
pours
a
huge
head
that
laces
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
nose
had
a
large
fresh
caramel
apple
scent
mixed
with
a
floral
hoppy
note
the
taste
starts
with
silky
caramel
that
fades
into
a
fresh
apple
rhine
mixed
with
a
spicy
hop
accent
the
mouthfeel
is
med
body
that
leaves
a
long
finish
on
the
tongue
the
drinkabillity
is
great
low
alcohol
with
a
smooth
malt
driiven
finish
that
leaves
you
thirstin
for
more
i
can
see
why
this
brew
is
there
flagship
beer
there
ipa
has
more
complexety
but
for
a
esb
this
a
world
class
winner
bubbles
look
heavy
in
this
but
carbonation
is
pretty
balanced
on
the
palate
nice
finish
no
aftertaste
ill
take
another
lots
of
bubbly
carbonation
tingly
on
the
tongue
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
ill
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
rich
amber
to
maroon
color

a
light
beige

big
floral

hibiscus
tea
and
some

and
flavor

unique
i
love
this
beer
another
fine
alesmith
brew
would
love
to
have
more
of
these
perfect
session
beer
if
only
a
little
bland
very
americanized
version
i
was
expecting
big
things
from
this
one
i
have
never
had
any
alesmith
products
and
i
have
heardread
great
things
esb
is
one
of
my
favorite
style
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
have
it
again
served
in
a
dimpled
pilsner
glass
cause
that
is
the
only
thing
i
had
around
at
the
time
aroma
is
bready
malts
and
lemonny
hops
some
cinnamon
too
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
light
amberbrown
lacing
was
excellent
the
glass
was
a
history
of
every
sip
taken
inital
flavor
is
a
touch
salty
and
then
lightly
sour
at
the
finish
after
taste
is
a
bit
prunny
light
to
medium
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
mighty
refreshing
md
very
easy
on
the
palate
medium
to
light
bodied
carbonation
serves
to
present
a
creamy
texture
good
drinkability
really
nothing
to
complain
about
another
winner
from
alesmith
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
yeast
sediment
floating
around
anvil
has
a
big
tan
head
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
and
effervescence
the
head
shrinks
to
a
substantial
covering
on
the
surface
a
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
is
present
as
the
head
stays
on
top
of
the
beer
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
pleasant
yeasty
sourness
notes
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
are
present
too
a
nice
hop
aroma
is
there
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
balances
well
a
fruity
taste
is
apparent
with
cherries
being
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
this
medium
bodied
beer
fills
the
mouth
and
tickles
the
tongue
with
mini
bubbles
and
a
perfect
carbonation
level
roasted
flavors
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
give
anvil
a
pleasant
smokeybitter
aftertaste
this
is
one
ill
be
drinking
again
drinks
okay
i
like
my
esbs
maltier
this
one
is
just
okaygood
im
shocked
ale
smith
has
made
at
least
one
beer
that
im
not
crazy
about
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
very
nice
i
could
drink
this
all
day
spicey
herbal
tea
flavors
really
stand
out
and
is
quite
enjoyable
a
lightly
sweetened
bready
malt
rounds
out
the
middle
and
finishes
with
a
persistent
bitterness
that
accents
and
balances
nearly
perfectly
some
fruity
aspects
come
thru
on
the
finish
as
well
refreshing
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
highly
sessionable
what
a
great
thing
to
be
trying
a
new
alesmith
brew
this
one
poured
a
very
vigorous
deep
orange
amber
a
very
dark
color
which
took
me
a
little
by
surprise
to
be
honest
a
very
nice
three
inches
of
head
formed
on
the
top
in
a
good
light
tan
to
off
white
color
great
retention
had
this
thing
hanging
around
for
what
seemed
like
forever
some
sediment
actually
poured
out
of
the
bottom
and
graced
over
the
top
of
the
foam
at
the
end
a
very
hazy
and
cloudy
brownish
amber
this
was
and
it
had
a
very
full
look
to
it
a
very
nice
aroma
of
deep
caramel
malts
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
a
nice
subtle
hoppiness
as
well
though
sweet
the
flavor
was
very
full
almost
a
hoppy
scotch
ale
of
sorts
very
big
with
a
grainy
and
chewy
kind
of
feel
to
it
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
led
to
a
great
rich
feel
and
this
was
just
a
superb
drinker
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
much
more
full
bodied
then
some
of
the
esbs
i
have
had
in
the
past
this
one
really
had
a
body
on
it
and
was
very
filling
great
hoppy
finish
and
a
very
well
rounded
feel
a
great
esb
and
a
great
addition
to
the
alesmith
lineup
this
one
was
definitely
a
keeper
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
a
forced
1
inch
head
comprised
of
tiny
bubbles
it
reduces
quickly
leaving
behind
a
solid
coat
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
the
malts
waft
out
and
present
themselves
in
the
form
of
molasses
vanilla
wood
and
earth
the
hops
bring
floral
and
fruity
notes
to
the
table
i
can
also
smell
the
yeast
the
taste
isnt
very
bitter
at
all
quite
balanced
but
probably
leaning
more
on
the
malt
in
addition
to
the
characteristics
previously
mentioned
there
is
also
a
sweetness
resembling
orange
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
with
very
little
carbonation
bite
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
could
not
drink
too
many
of
these
pretty
heavy
and
sweet
not
a
session
beer
for
sure
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
esb
worth
a
try
and
would
be
a
nice
sessionable
beer
six
packs
please
d
a
good
englishstyle
bitter
i
enjoyed
this
experience
thouroughly
its
nice
to
see
a
west
coast
brewery
not
make
a
giant
monster
ale
every
time
and
instead
concentrate
on
the
subtle
fragrant
wonders
and
complexities
of
a
sessionable
style
like
english
bitter
though
i
do
like
those
big
monster
ales
good
beer
but
not
up
to
what
i
expect
from
alesmith
beautiful
color
perhaps
a
one
fingered
head
that
quickly
dissipates
good
could
drink
all
day
but
not
overly
striking
bottle
courtesy
of
naven
poured
a
medium
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
as
well
aroma
of
dry
malt
with
some
fresh
lightly
bitter
hops
taste
is
also
well
balance
between
dry
malt
with
some
very
light
sweet
notes
and
a
dry
light
bitter
finish
average
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
was
simple
without
much
complexity
but
well
made
to
quench
thirst
a
medium
bodied
ale
which
was
sweet
and
malty
drinkability
was
good
i
would
most
definately
recommend
this
ale
to
anyone
looking
for
an
enjoyable
esb
pours
a
dark
rich
copper
hue

a
huge
two

colored

very
nutty

a
nice
caramel

balances
out
the
initial

extremely
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
really
enjoy
this
brew
cant
say
ive
had
an
esb
quite
like
this
alesmith
amazes
everytime
pick
this
one
up
for
sure
this
isnt
so
bad
if
you
keep
it
very
cold
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
giant
like
alesmith
a
coworker
brought
some
alesmith
bombers
back
from
ca
for
me
very
cool
dude
and
this
was
one
of
them
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
orange
which
was
almost
brown
the
head
was
large
white
and
rocky
the
bottle
conditioning
really
carbonates
this
beer
as
i
got
way
too
much
foam
even
though
i
poured
slowly
and
gently
the
smell
was
a
little
malty
and
caramel
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
aromas
the
taste
was
good
with
caramel
coming
into
play
and
maybe
it
was
citrus
i
was
detecting
the
drinkability
was
very
good
as
my
pint
was
gone
fast
mouthfeel
really
benefits
from
the
bottle
conditioning
as
the
beer
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
lighttomedium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
seems
good
the
metallic
finish
is
a
little
oftputting
its
not
there
constantly
but
when
it
sneaks
through
it
kind
of
overwhelms
the
rest
of
the
flavors
factoring
that
in
that
pulls
down
the
score
drinkability
is
good
and
id
be
interested
in
trying
out
another
example
to
see
if
the
metallic
characteristic
is
always
this
evident
its
a
reddish
orange
in
color
but
the
head
is
barely
adequate
enjoyable
smell
of
crisp
fresh
hops
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
caramel
are
picked
up
by
the
nose
taste
is
both
fruity
and
hoppy
but
more
bitter
than
hoppy
peach
flavor
can
be
traced
and
has
a
yeasty
finish
by
the
feel
of
the
beer
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
english
so
props
to
alesmith
for
that
pretty
good
stuff
though
the
style
doesnt
blow
me
away
d
rather
easy
to
drink
esb
but
the
high
level
of
carbonation
almost
foamy
in
mouth
detracts
from
the
overall
taste
i
am
a
big
fan
of
alesmith
but
this
beer
lacks
overall
character
that
would
warrant
repeat
performances
given
other
options
in
the
esb
category
as
well
as
other
more
desirable
alesmith
choices
thinner
medium
body
with
very
active
carbonation
almost
a
little
too
active
this
bomber
will
be
finished
off
rather
easily
very
sessionable
brew
d
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
part
of
that
is
because
its
a
rather
bland
beer
all
in
all
its
rather
unmemorable
probably
not
something
ill
be
picking
up
in
the
future
pours
a
dark
coppery
orange
slight
sediment
makes
it
hazy
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
nice
light
sweet
malty
aroma
musk
melon
fruity
and
candy
sweetness
nice
and
light
also
some
citrus
notes
but
definitely
more
melony
sweetness
taste
is
more
of
the
melon
and
fruity
sweetness
a
little
candy
like
some
slight
peppery
and
dry
bitterness
balances
very
nicely
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
light
to
medium
and
creamy
body
is
balanced
by
a
peppery
tingle
on
the
tongue
from
the
hops
and
what
carbonation
is
present
very
nice
highly
sessionable
beer
a
very
nice
esb
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
enjoy
this
one
and
its
rather
refreshing
too
ill
likely
get
this
again
and
it
leaves
me
curious
about
the
other
alesmith
beers
as
well
this
arrived
at
my
table
basically
lacking
a
head
this
could
have
been
due
to
a
wait
time
but
it
detracted
from
the
overall
look
of
the
beer
there
really
wasnt
much
smell
to
speak
of
slight
malt
but
really
dull
in
the
aroma
area
as
you
sip
in
the
malt
provides
you
with
the
first
note
followed
by
some
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
subtle
like
a
good
english
esb
there
also
was
not
much
carbonation
to
this
brew
even
for
an
esb
this
could
be
the
reault
of
a
poor
kegtap
but
the
liars
club
is
usually
on
point
still
at
2
50
a
pint
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
something
id
reach
for
drinkability
definitely
sessionable
and
worthy
of
a
session
too
many
thanks
to
intriqken

a
great
esb

not
my
favorite

since
i
am
a
bit
of
a
hop
head
scores
are
more
reflective
of
stylistic
accuracy
rather
than
my
personal
preference
easy
to
drink
would
session
quite
well
very
pleasant

esb
true
to
style
and
a
very
nice
product
indeed
medium

with
a
light

with
some

bitterness
as
well
mouth
excellent
sweet
honey
flavor
up
front
with
a
bitter
grassy
finish
the
hops
are
really
herby
and
fresh
from
front
to
back
tastes
kind
of
like
tea
and
honey
with
a
bitter
roasted
finish
mouthfeel
is
superb
running
enjoyable
carbonation
from
front
to
back
as
well
this
beer
is
insanely
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
and
its
so
flavorful
i
am
very
tempted
to
this
is
a
great
beer
from
alesmith
and
i
will
seek
it
out
again
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
mellow
change
of
pace
from
those
hop
bombs
look
no
further
this
is
one
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
d
mellow
well
crafted
this
would
go
well
with
a
cheese
and
cracker
snack
or
at
a
relaxing
dinner
this
brew
now
has
me
wanting
to
dig
into
this
esb
style
some
more
delightful
d
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
i
have
had
if
only
the
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
stood
out
a
little
more
this
would
be
very
impressive
d
not
a
bad
esb
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
style
or
alesmith
beer
the
esb
probably
would
have
been
my
least
choice
to
throw
on
cask
but
who
am
i
to
complain
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
great
session
beer
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
esbs
and
they
are
more
watery
than
i
like
this
one
is
very
drinkable
but
the
mouthfeel
is
not
reallly
what
i
prefer
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
the
color
is
nice
it
poured
with
literally
no
head
at
all
i
dont
know
if
that
is
normal
for
an
esb
or
not
but
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
it
theres
not
doubt
that
this
is
a
quality
beer
but
it
just
isnt
my
favorite
style
still
since
the
taste
is
good
and
it
is
very
drinkable
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
also
want
to
say
thanks
to
peter
for
running
a
great
company
alesmith
drinkability
was
just
great
a
very
solid
beer
by
alesmith
best
esb
ive
had
a
damn
fine
ale
ive
only
had
a
few
esbs
and
this
one
is
great
very
easy
to
drink
very
light
with
a
bit
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
really
see
why
id
want
to
next
time
i
have
a
craving
for
an
esb
ill
go
for
a
fullers
or
youngs
tastes
williamette
hoppy
very
dirty
earthy
hops
with
an
underlying
malt
sweet
there
is
a
bitterness
im
not
fond
of
i
cant
tell
if
the
bitter
is
from
hops
or
failed
malt
malt
tastes
like
rancid
caramel
and
leaves
a
plastic
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
some
dry
chocolate
and
biscuit
qualities
now
that
im
giving
a
more
detailed
examination
dry
finish
is
grassy
from
hops
without
hop
bitter
very
weedy
rough
toasted
grain
finish
comes
across
almost
as
burned
this
was
not
an
enjoyable
beer
imo
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
mdlight
carbonation
is
mild
and
a
thin
layer
of
head
hung
around
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
beer
is
good
happy
beeing
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
that
indicates
it
could
be
dry
hopped
also
it
has
a
small
head
despite
an
agressive
pour
head
goes
down
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
in
its
wake
smell
is
suprisingly
light
some
malts
and
a
citris
hop
profile
but
not
in
big
quantities
taste
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
tastes
like
a
well
hopped
brown
ale
smoky
malts
make
the
first
impression
followed
by
a
nice
hop
profile
but
not
over
the
top
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
despite
the
low
abv
and
the
drinkability
is
also
nice
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
not
at
all
drinkability
was
fairly
good
with
a
little
more
body
and
some
heft
in
the
bittering
department
it
would
be
excellent
as
is
it
is
a
very
drinkalbe
brew
but
not
a
fullon
esb
for
me
delightful
summer
ale
so
fresh
tasting
and
very
quenching
mild
ale
sweetness
amd
wholesome
bready
notes
in
the
aroma
orangeamber
body
with
a
wispy
oil
slick
of
a
head
graintinged
fore
is
mild
on
the
tongue
with
an
equally
mild
hop
profile
very
grainy
feeling
and
tasting
and
that
invokes
bread
some
biscuit
and
a
general
heartiness
to
the
beer
thicker
feel
than
many
esbs
ive
had
and
good
overall
flavor
intensity
22oz
pours
a
clear
amber
with
not
much
head
very
little
carbonation
scents
of
apples
and
hops
on
the
nose
roasted
carmelized
slightly
coffee
flavors
mixed
in
with
bitter
notes
that
continue
into
the
finish
thought
the
roasted
flavors
overwhelmed
the
fruit
and
predominated
the
taste
buds
bottle
courtesy
of
zorro
overall
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
well
crafted
i
would
enjoy
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
when
poured
it
was
a
medium
orange
brown
in
color
with
no
foam
or
lace
the
smell
was
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
mild
hops
the
taste
was
the
same
a
the
smell
but
lacking
any
quality
of
taste
like
i
said
a
weak
and
flat
taste
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
fruit
this
is
not
what
i
expected
with
alesmith
so
far
this
is
the
worst
beer
that
ive
tasted
from
alesmith
not
impressed
give
it
a
try
i
was
plesantly
suprised
by
this
not
one
of
their
bigger
beers
from
alesmith
cheers
quite
a
drinkable
number
though
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
some
cheers
picked
up
this
gem
at
wild
oats
in
scottsdale
az
what
a
rare
treat
this
was
i
was
out
hiking
in
the
desert
all
day
and
got
back
to
the
hotel
in
time
to
order
room
service
they
asked
if
i
needed
anything
to
drink
with
my
meal
and
i
said
no
thanks
i
was
already
supplied
with
some
of
this
brew
and
some
alaskan
smoked
porter
great
brew
this
one
nicely
balanced
clean
on
the
palate
deep
chestnut
and
faint
carbonation
a
great
session
brew
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
session
beer
for
sure
id
buy
this
again
22oz
bomber
that
i
purchased
on
my
trip
to
socal
a
few
weeks
back
pours
a
deep
clear
copper
frothy
head
that
dies
slowly
and
leaves
lace
in
its
wake
as
i
drain
the
glass
sweet
malt
and
hazelnut
in
the
nose
and
subtle
smattering
of
hops
flavor
yields
one
of
the
most
balanced
brews
ive
ever
sampled
dry
toasted
biscuity
malt
up
front
balanced
perfectly
with
a
very
mild
bitter
finish
orange
peel
and
blueberry
linger
in
the
aftertaste
ever
so
sweet
carbonation
is
very
light
and
tingling
and
the
beer
manages
to
be
quite
smooth
on
the
palate
though
has
enough
before
it
gets
anywhere
near
creamy
relatively
low
abv
plus
the
aforementioned
balance
and
deliciousness
make
this
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
alesmith
please
send
kegs
to
pa
bomber
with
a
silk
screen
label
poured
into
a
0
5l
stein
this
is
a
bottled
conditioned
beer
so
i
left
about
at
the
bottom
to
keep
the
sentiment
out
of
my
glass
this
esb
is
a
rich
caramel
color
with
medium
white
head
made
of
small
bubbles
that
dissipated
but
kept
a
nice
thing
rim
of
foam
around
the
side
understated
aroma
with
notes
of
maple
syrup
plumb
and
faint
hints
of
bitter
citrus
the
flavor
is
a
rich
bled
of
caramel
and
bread
crust
apples
and
leaf
tea
which
finishes
with
a
medium
bettering
hopprofile
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
a
very
good
american
example
of
this
classic
british
style
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
full
almost
creamy
but
not
too
viscous
good
drinkability
consistent
with
the
style
a
good
session
beer
taste
is
very
simple
just
swirling
sweet
midspectrum
malt
with
a
citrusy
hop
bitterness
and
slight
yeast
near
the
finish
this
is
a
good
esb
but
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
right
on
if
it
had
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
pours
a
hazy
copper
colour
with
a
wonderful
creamy
white
head
toasty
sweet
and
very
fresh
very
fruity
and
herbal
medium
bodied
nice
fluffy
mouthfeel
muted
carbonation
and
great
drinkability
very
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
very
nice
and
flavourful
esb
the
carbonation
almost
stings
my
tongue
which
is
good
because
the
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
brings
out
the
best
of
the
sugary
malts
and
rounds
out
the
flavor
with
flying
colors
drinkable
you
bet
viva
la
esb
just
a
joy
to
drink
this
would
easily
be
a
favorite
around
my
place
were
it
more
easily
available
as
is
its
something
to
look
forward
to
when
travelling
through
those
areas
where
it
is
available
great
beer
esbs
are
evidently
not
my
preference
although
i
like
the
option
i
would
opt
for
something
else
being
unfamiliar
with
the
esb
style
i
really
have
nothing
to
compare
this
to
but
my
own
tastebuds
from
that
i
can
say
anvil
is
a
smooth
crisp
drinker
with
loads
of
hop
and
malt
character
bright
amber
color
very
clear
this
beer
came
from
the
bottle
with
a
thin
tan
head
wonderfully
complex
nose
fruity
with
green
apples
figs
and
light
toffee
the
flavor
a
light
caramel
note
followed
by
more
of
the
fruit
red
delicious
rather
than
green
apples
silky
light
mouth
feel
is
a
huge
surprise
this
beer
would
be
incredible
on
a
warm
summer
day
thankfully
i
know
a
place
where
i
can
get
a
bunch
of
these
guys
and
i
can
only
hope
to
see
it
on
tap
anywhere
i
go
i
would
buy
this
again
i
respect
alesmith
for
perfectly
replicating
a
british
esb
with
no
compromises
no
americanization
etc
definitely
an
amazing
brew
by
virtue
of
the
skill
of
its
crafters
overall
impression
highly
drinkable
and
nicely
reminsecent
of
cask
conditioned
beers
very
well
done
wish
i
could
get
it
locally
drinkability
so
damn
smooth
i
could
drink
this
every
day
anvil
has
become
the
esb
to
top
in
my
book
and
holds
its
own
against
pretty
much
anything
else
as
well
in
my
top
5
easily
orangeyamber
color
with
a
fine
sticky
offwhite
head
aromas
of
candied
citrus
fruit
and
lightly
toasted
caramel
soft
mellow
nose
with
a
slightly
juicy
ripe
citrusorange
blossom
hoppiness
on
an
estery
caramel
malt
frame
mouthfeel
is
excellent
supple
spicy
very
light
spiced
bread
sweetness
towards
the
back
with
a
fresh
cleansing
finish
maybe
just
a
bit
watery
nicely
integrated
flavors
true
to
the
english
style
and
very
quaffable
its
reminiscent
of
stoudts
scarlet
lady
with
its
mellow
orange
spicyness
excellent
esb
one
of
my
favorites
orangeamber
in
colour
with
a
slightly
lower
than
average
carbonation
level
aromas
are
quite
fruity
from
both
the
yeast
and
the
fruityfloral
english
maybe
goldings
hops
theres
a
good
balance
between
the
caramel
malt
and
hop
flavors
and
some
additional
mineral
and
yeast
notes
too
the
mouth
feel
is
quite
unusual
very
smooth
and
rounded
almost
salty
but
not
overly
heavy
doesnt
quite
pack
the
same
flavor
punch
as
the
best
esbs
that
ive
had
but
this
is
still
highly
drinkable
stuff
it
was
great
with
steak
another
awesome
brew
for
alesmith
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
small
head
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
through
out
nice
scents
of
hops
malt
and
some
sweetness
this
esb
tastes
quite
a
bit
different
than
other
esbs
ive
had
but
its
still
very
good
whats
missing
is
the
bitterness
and
bite
at
the
end
this
esb
is
sweet
and
light
dry
like
i
said
this
is
an
awesome
brew
from
alesmith
give
it
a
try
just
to
be
different
lol
slightly
disappointed
by
this
one
i
was
expecting
more
but
it
is
still
very
good
again
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
is
preventing
this
esb
from
breaking
through
into
the
upper
tier
of
beers
maybe
that
aforementioned
butter
aftertaste
is
too
strong
maybe
the
hops
need
to
be
more
noticeable
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
with
an
incredible
flavour
and
in
my
opinion
perfect
alcohol
level
will
definitely
be
having
more
of
this
one
after
the
incredibly
wonderful
delightfully
delicious
alesmith
ipa
and
yulesmith
dipa
my
expectations
for
anvil
ale
were
sky
high
although
it
failed
to
meet
those
expectations
its
far
from
disappointing
beer
in
the
final
reckoning
its
a
good
example
of
the
american
esb
style
and
should
appeal
to
a
wide
range
of
people
drinkability
bar
none
the
best
of
a
lone
few
esbs
i
have
ever
had
still
new
to
this
style
but
this
was
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
clear
warm
amber
with
one
finger
of
eggshell
head
anvil
has
a
light
fruity
nose
melded
to
a
cidery
smell
and
a
strange
taste
thats
too
fruity
to
be
traditional
yet
too
quirky
to
appease
innovative
artistry
the
flavor
tilts
towards
apricot
with
a
bittering
element
sharper
than
historic
trends
anvil
tastes
like
an
american
pale
with
overconditioned
water
and
left
me
in
no
hurry
for
another
the
smell
is
dominated
by
malts
in
the
taste
this
one
starts
to
shine
with
a
great
balance
between
malts
and
hops
light
hints
of
fruitiness
come
though
with
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
pleasing
while
the
drinkability
is
very
high
notes
almost
average
across
the
board
i
think
i
rank
the
beers
low
compared
to
others
but
i
like
to
think
im
consisten
so
it
doesnt
matter
i
enjoyed
the
maltyhop
contrast
and
it
has
a
nice
lingering
aftertaste
they
hide
the
alcohol
well
and
a
decent
appearance
incredibly
smooth
and
refreshing
against
perhaps
lacking
slightly
in
charactercomplexity
nice
beer
the
taste
is
benevolent
with
its
flavors
sweet
malts
finish
in
a
toffee
and
caramel
kiss
the
mouth
is
left
immediately
wanting
it
takes
a
second
sip
to
realize
that
the
flavor
wants
to
hide
but
cant
quite
fully
whats
amazing
is
this
beer
is
so
uniuqe
not
only
as
an
esb
but
as
any
beer
and
it
emplores
you
to
pay
it
all
the
attention
it
deserves
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
colour
topped
by
a
thin
lace
of
offwhite
head
even
with
the
minimal
head
from
the
pour
the
retention
was
excellent
and
resulted
in
lace
all
the
way
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
little
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
along
with
a
complex
hop
profile
consisting
of
floral
pine
citrus
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
the
flavour
was
very
nicely
balanced
between
malt
and
hop
character
nice
base
of
malt
sweetness
with
caramel
and
biscuit
evident
bitterness
was
assertive
but
without
any
resinous
quality
and
a
nice
pineyfloral
flavour
the
finish
was
short
but
maintained
its
balance
body
was
mediumlight
and
carbonation
was
moderate
smooth
texture
overall
a
really
nice
session
beer
mouthfeel
all
around
this
is
a
truly
remarkable
beer
the
flavors
are
well
crafted
and
balanced
to
provide
a
wonderful
drinking
experience
nothing
is
overdone
while
nothing
is
also
under
represented
excellent
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
this
beer
excels
in
flavor
where
others
simply
cannot

wheres

i
am
surprised
i
was
able

i
did
it

thanks
don
for
bringing
back
fresh
from
san

major
props
to

this

me
a
chance
to
experience
some
west
coast
brews
not

accessible
in

parts
appearance

a
solid

color
that
is
leaving
little
lacing
behind

is
subtle
of
malts
hops
and
a
light
wiff
of

taste
is
of
caramelly
malts
slight

and
a
light
fruity
finish
mouth
feel
is
full
and
lively
overall
drinkability
is
near
perfect
as
the
abv
is
quite
harmless
the
beer
is
flawlessly
smooth
and
my
palate
has
lots
to
contemplate
with
this
complex
well
brewed
beer
as
esbs
go
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
light
floral
hopping
as
well
as
a
toasty
malt
the
flavor
is
very
dry
and
somewhat
mild
toasty
malts
and
a
light
hopping
make
it
easy
to
drink
but
its
lacking
some
flavors
very
enjoyable
but
it
could
use
something
to
kick
it
up
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
rubied
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
nicely
coats
the
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
nice
lots
of
sweet
caramel
balanced
out
with
a
light
bitter
from
the
hop
the
flavor
is
somewhat
light
for
my
liking
the
caramel
and
hops
are
there
but
feel
rather
distant
and
not
quite
as
brilliant
as
i
would
like
them
to
be
the
feel
is
moderate
and
nice
with
a
very
light
carb
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
well
the
beer
is
very
smooth
not
too
filling
and
very
easy
to
put

3
finishes
sweet
my
first
beer
whilst
visiting
san
diego
for
the
first
time
the
convenient
store
near
my
hotel
had
a
few
alesmiths
the
esb
is
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
head
relatively
low
carbonation
the
smell
is
pleasant
nothing
mindblowing
just
some
sweet
malt
with
the
faintest
grassy
hops
background
this
drinks
like
an
esb
that
has
been
brewed
with
some
brown
sugar
or
molasses
or
something
like
that
it
has
that
slightest
cloying
flavor
that
goes
away
just
before
it
becomes
too
much
as
it
warms
this
is
accentuated
and
the
hops
profile
drops
significantly
there
are
definitely
some
toffee
notes
here
overall
a
nice
session
beer
this
would
make
with
some
fish
and
chips
it
reminded
me
of
old
peculiar
but
slightly
lighter
and
less
cloying
drinkability

this
is
a
great
session
beer
that
came
across
as
a
bit
bockish
but
went
down
well
absolutely
wonderful
the
only
more
i
would
ask
for
is
some
additional
yeast
character
maybe
hints
of
phenolics
or
diacetyl
even
could
bring
this
beer
over
the
edge
as
it
is
though
it
is
something
i
really
wish
i
could
have
all
the
time
sampled
on
tap
at
fathers
office
in
santa
monica
appeared
a
deep
copper
with
a
sticky
white
head
that
converted
to
a
creamy
ring
left
an
intricate
web
of
lacing
down
the
pint
glass
earthy
hops
caramel
malt
sweet
fruit
in
the
nose
rich
malts
everywhere
loads
more
caramel
with
toasted
almonds
toffee
fantastically
balanced
by
spicy
peppery
intheground
floral
hops
beautifully
balanced
seriously
complex
ale
especially
for
a
fairly
low
gravity
brew
medium
to
light
bodied
almost
airy
in
the
mouth
it
was
tough
for
me
to
have
just
one
of
these
what
a
treat
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
had
this
poured
out
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
of
white
head
that
left
virtually
no
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
smell
of
sweet
caramel
with
a
bit
of
earthy
toned
hops
peaking
every
now
and
then
the
flavor
was
very
mild
with
caramel
malt
and
balancing
earthy
hops
that
added
a
nice
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
about
lightmedium
with
a
super
creaminess
about
it
that
allowed
it
to
go
down
of
so
smoothly
very
light
refreshing
sessionable
brew
here
that
can
be
put
down
all
night
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
very
fine
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
of
slight
hops
taste
is
kind
of
like
the
malt
backbone
of
a
pale
ale
that
almost
sour
wateriness
with
hints
of
slight
citrus
but
then
you
get
the
hop
aftertaste
it
isnt
aggressive
and
it
isnt
sharp
but
its
definitely
bitter
not
in
your
face
bitter
but
a
slight
earthy
bitter
that
acts
as
a
nice
counterpoint
the
carbonation
is
low
nice
and
smooth
but
maybe
id
want
more
intensely
quaffable
though
and
if
i
were
out
in
california
id
drink
this
as
a
session
brew
overall
im
kinda
on
the
fence
about
alesmiths
take
on
the
esb
it
seemed
so
low
in
carbonation
that
it
had
me
thinking
it
was
caskconditioned
the
flavors
struck
me
as
being
backward
from
how
i
normally
taste
beer
that
said
id
probably
look
elsewhere
for
my
next
esb
brown
22
oz
bomber
with
a
bit
of
information
about
the
beer
on
the
back
side
the
pour
into
a
standard
pint
glass
is
deep
reddish
amber
in
color
and
clear
in
texture
with
a
light
carbonation
level
forming
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
notes
of
honey
and
a
delicate
flowery
hoppyness
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
sweet
caramel
malts
a
decent
dose
of
bittering
citric
english
hops
and
a
touch
of
roasted
nuts
smooth
and
soothing
on
the
palette
with
a
medium
creamy
thick
body
that
has
a
dry
aftertaste
very
sessionable
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
often
a
great
beer
easily
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
a
tasty
brew
highly
recommended
thanks
to
xlperro
for
the
bomber
my
2nd
alesmith
and
a
solid
style
of
a
small
beer
though
im
not
a
huge
esb
fan
i
still
like
this
beer
and
id
have
it
again
especially
if
alesmith
shipped
west
we
can
dream
cant
we
i
could
drink
a
keg
in
one
sitting
and
still
be
thirsty
for
reals
appearance
poured
into
my
aventinus
glass
after
sitting
out
of
the
fridge
for
awhile
allowing
it
to
warm
up
a
bit
forms
a
nice
caramel
tan
head
that
compliments
the
deep
plum
ruby
tone
of
the
body
nice
and
cloudy
some
yeasties
floating
around
lacing
chunky
patches
spread
unevenly
with
each
sip
not
bad
aroma
hops
have
a
very
herbal
tone
with
some
caramel
malts
seeking
through
and
a
mineral
note
to
add
as
well
a
bit
metallic
but
not
in
an
off
way
taste
fair
mix
of
big
flavors
with
a
great
amount
of
hoppiness
that
is
almost
tame
due
to
the
amount
of
malts
used
here
perfect
sparring
match
between
the
caramel
malts
and
piney
hops
great
balance
is
where
this
beer
got
its
reputation
not
in
your
face
flavor
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
mellow
carbonation
nice
texture
going
down
drinkability
the
balance
of
flavors
is
what
makes
this
beer
great
overall
esb
fits
the
style
while
still
adding
its
own
flavor
this
was
an
extraordinarily
nutty
beer
and
otherwise
reminded
me
of
fullers
esb
amber
copper
opaque
body
with
a
thin
head
and
amazing
lace
hop
flavor
is
to
complementary
to
the
nutbread
malt
back
bone
and
not
as
bracing
as
many
other
reviewers
state
the
thin
creamy
carbonation
was
delightful
this
was
a
great
brew
had
at
fathers
office
in
santa
monica
went
wonderfully
with
food
but
had
enough
personality
to
love
on
its
own
a
lightly
chillhazed
rubyambercopper
color
that
is
topped
by
a
tan
head
aromas
of
caramel
malt
and
subtle
hop
aromas
perfectly
carbonated
for
a
beer
called
esb
nice
and
light
malty
with
some
toasted
malt
biscuit
notes
lightly
sweet
in
the
finish
accompanied
by
a
pleasing
bitter
hop
finish
pretty
well
balanced
leaning
perhaps
a
bit
more
to
the
hop
side
of
the
spectrum
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
would
love
to
sample
from
the
cask
there
is
a
very
nice
pleasing
fruitiness
that
expresses
itself
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
shows
a
sense
of
balance
subtlety
that
is
too
often
overlooked
by
many
american
micros
this
nice
esb
pours
a
cloudy
amber
head
retention
is
excellent
and
lacing
is
beautiful
aroma
is
pretty
mellow
with
malt
dominating
very
smooth
malty
taste
profile
with
a
touch
of
hop
very
grainy
too
ultradrinkable
esb
from
a
brewer
whose
beers
i
have
been
very
curious
about
very
nice
beer
thanks
to
rkhaze
who
is
a
part
of
some
great
guys
at
the
whole
foods
meat
department
i
shop
at
a
decent
appearance
with
a
tawny
amber
body
and
a
nice
cream
head
and
nice
lace
the
nose
is
light
and
gives
off
malt
with
light
floral
hops
in
the
background
mild
flavoring
with
a
decent
balance
but
little
bittering
the
feel
is
fairly
creamy
with
little
crispness
in
the
finish
easily
drinkable
session
brew
as
the
liars
brew
at
the
liars
club
drinkability
a
poor
showing
imo
from
alesmith
but
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
there
is
no
born
on
or
drink
by
date
so
maybe
it
sat
too
long
on
somebodys
shelf
might
try
again
but
not
likey
mouthfeel
is
lush
and
well
rounded
great
balance
here
and
just
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hop
head
this
ale
drinks
well
and
would
be
a
fine
session
beer
i
feel
this
ale
could
be
a
nice
crossover
ale
for
macro
drinkers
because
it
is
smooth
and
not
too
strong
it
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
i
originally
sampled
this
beer
on
27
may
2003
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
this
pours
a
nice
copper
color
it
is
smooth
on
the
palate
in
my
opinion
this
would
be
a
very
good
session
beer
its
nice
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
given
that
other
alesmith
beers
are
world
class
this
one
isnt
worth
seeking
out
sweet
fruity
taste
rings
through
and
through
the
length
of
the
large
bottles
contents
a
surprising
treat
though
ive
heard
so
many
good
things
about
alesmith
i
shouldnt
have
been
shocked
one
of
the
best
esbs
to
have
met
my
lips
big
thanks
to
bierriese
for
providing
f
medium
brown
color
medium

aroma
is
brown
sugar
and

a
lighter

more
in
the
english
style
of
bitter
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
this
is
one
classy
brew
its
almost
casky
creamy
smooth
beautiful
not
much
of
a
head
on
this
one
with
only
slight
lacing
in
the
glass
which
sems
typical
of
an
esb
reminds
me
alot
like
fullers
esb
has
that
english
thing
going
on
just
not
as
bitter
as
an
english
esb
overall
nice
tasting
beer
and
another
great
ale
from
alesmith
copper
in
color
with
a
frothy

is
pretty
mild
though
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
and
herbal
hops
flavor
is
much
the
same
surprisingly
sweet
midpalate
for
an
esb
though
the
hop
finish
balances
things
off
nicely
i
havent
much
to
say
about
this
beer
really
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
but
not
as
impressive
and
deep
as
i
would
expect
from
alesmith
well
done
alesmith
i
wish
this
was
available
in
the
midwest
more
please
very
nice
looking
beer
here
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
nicely
sized
offwhite
head
leaves
lots
of
lace
and
head
retention
is
pretty
decent
the
aroma
features
floral
hops
galore
along
with
a
healthy
dose
of
biscuity
and
grainy
malt
quite
nice
the
flavors
are
even
more
impressive
starts
off
with
just
a
little
bitterness
then
goes
to
a
nice
biscuity
maltiness
in
the
middle
the
bitterness
returns
showing
more
hop
character
its
oilyresiny
and
slightly
leafy
the
leafiness
increases
in
the
back
and
in
the
aftertaste
malt
is
a
little
sweet
and
grainy
in
places
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
smooth
finishes
with
a
final
stroke
of
bitterness
one
excellent
esb
right
here
grab
it
if
you
can
orange
in
color
poured
very
not
agressive
this
beer
still
came
out
with
a
gigantic
thick
white
big
bubbled
head
suprisingly
their
was
no
sediment
in
the
bottle
which
from
previous
reviews
i
thought
there
would
be
the
aroma
was
alright
the
head
bubbles
kind
of
hid
it
but
what
i
got
from
it
with
a
slightly
fruity
hop
and
rust
mixture
it
was
in
a
clean
glass
the
taste
itself
was
pretty
good
malty
with
a
nice
hop
bitter
highly
carbonated
maybe
too
much
even
fruity
little
citrus
orangeish
super
creamy
in
mouth
feel
still
it
had
a
slight
metallic
taste
the
body
was
medium
and
left
a
nice
aftertaste
carefully
poured
off
of
the
yeast
sediment
its
only
slightly
hazy
the
body
is
a
standard
amber
color
and
the
head
is
a
short
creamy
light
tan
cap
that
holds
well
keeping
a
thin
and
creamy
14
surface
covering
throughout
the
pint
very
nice
appearance
the
aroma
comes
on
strong
its
sharply
fruity
and
citrusy
orange
apricot
some
lemon
over
a
sweet
caramel
and
honeyish
malt
definitely
attention
getting
the
body
is
medium
with
a
lightly
zesty
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
fruity
citrusy
orange
grapefruit
and
floral
flavors
from
yeast
and
hops
married
with
a
softly
sweet
and
lightly
toasty
malt
thats
backed
by
a
supportive
bitterness
it
finishes
fruity
but
drying
with
some
residual
toffeeish
malt
and
swirling
hop
flavors
very
nicely
balanced
quite
supple
and
alive
with
bold
flavors
very
clean
and
clearly
well
brewed
its
a
bit
of
an
american
interperetation
and
dare
i
say
it
a
touch
onesided
although
that
goes
partly
to
the
style
but
also
highly
drinkable
well
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
perfect
12
tan
head
that
sloslw
sinks
down
to
a
nice
film
slightly
bitter
earthy
hops
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
nice
backdrop
of
sweet
malt
sweet
toasty
malt
is
the
first
to
land
on
the
tongue
as
it
smooths
over
the
interior
of
the
mouth
and
slides
down
the
throat
in
all
its
silkiness
as
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
descends
a
bit
the
subtle
hops
emerge
and
provide
just
the
right
dose
of
bitterness
through
the
slightly
bitter
lingering
finish
this
brew
has
a
great
balance
and
excellent
medium
body
although
no
single
characteristic
stands
out
as
being
amazing
or
remarkably
memorable
the
balance
and
drinkability
of
this
brew
make
it
special
for
its
overall
qualities
nice
copper
color
with
a
small
but
appropriate
head
for
the
style
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
nice
hop
background
everything
comes
together
nicely
in
the
taste
which
has
currents
of
toasted
bread
and
just
a
bit
of
fruity
flavor
the
malt
flavor
is
well
balanced
when
the
hops
hit
the
back
of
the
tongue
on
the
way
down
it
has
a
wonderful
creamy
feel
and
is
profoundly
drinkable
whod
have
thought
that
guys
out
of
san
diego
would
be
able
to
hold
their

there

seen
before
not

like
it
i
really
like
this
taste
husky
grainy

a

raw

also

there
is
a
really
mellow
bitterness
this
beer
is
really
nice
and
easily
drinkable
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
had
notes
do
this
beer
some
justice
serve
it
at
cellar
temp
and
in
a
big
mug
to
give
nice
firm
pouring
highly
drinkable
with
back
and
forth
flavours
from
the
malt
and
hops
right
on
target
for
the
style
back
and
forth
of
hops
and
malt
this
one
is
a
keeper
overall
very
much
lie
bells
amber
but
with
firmer
bittering
hops
on
the
end
would
consider
this
more
an
amber
than
an
esb
a
very
american
take
on
the
style
plan
on
making
this
or
the
nonnitro
a
yearly
regular
this
was
a
flat
bitter
mess
poured
the
beer
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
no
head
aroma
was
bitter
and
stale
i
had
one
sip
and
poured
it
out
it
could
have
been
a
bad
bottle
the
entire
nitro
line
with
left
hand
is
groundbreaking
quality
great
beer
quality
flow
and
great
flavor
very
average
bottle
of
beer
good
good
good
good
good
12
oz
bottled
poured
hard
into
an
english
pint
good
flavor
great
texture
as
expected
nice
mouthfeel
not
as
flavorful
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
nice
body
and
head
nitro
always
yields
a
good
feel
not
as
tasty
and
crafty
as
their
other
offerings
disappointing
glad
i
tired
it
but
wont
purchase
again
the
look
is
unsatisfying
hardly
any
smell
tastes
flat
it
does
taste
more
smooth
as
i
drink
it
this
glass
more
i
dont
think
ill
get
this
beer
again
not
as
good
as
the
stout
but
the
feel
of
it
is
similar
if
i
dont
feel
like
drinking
the
milk
stout
i
go
for
this
one
another
horrible
flat
ale
couldnt
finish
it
to
give
any
review
how
are
they
still
in
business
after
the
reviews
ive
read
all
say
the
same
thing
i
feel
ive
been
cheated
great
beer
youve
got
to
dump
it
into
a
glass
to
get
any
head
all
their
nitros
are
that
way
hence
the
pour
hard
but
overall
a
very
silky
smooth
feel
and
great
taste
one
of
my
favorites
not
anything
to
write
home
about
overall
like
the
regular
sawtooth
this
nitrod
version
is
a
delicious
malty
slightly
sweet
englishstyle
esb
a
maltbomb
for
sure
its
another
great
beer
from
colorado
and
another
great
beer
from
left
hand
which
is
fastley
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
colorado
breweries
i
just
prefer
the
regular
version
of
sawtooth
over
the
nitroversion
this
beer
is
good
man
this
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
as
the
nitro
milk
stout
is
a
favorite
this
one
has
a
similar
texture
though
it
poured
flatter
and
has
more
of
a
hollowed
out
palate
if
the
abv
were
a
little
lower
it
would
make
sense
as
a
session
beer
if
this
isnt
a
mistake
by
left
hand
brewing
than
its
shameful
to
produce
let
alone
distribute
this
swill
this
was
just
boring
the
mouthfeel
was
great
and
it
didnt
taste
nasty
just
underwhelming
and
boring
light
watery
slightly
sweet
hops
then
light
watered
down
slightly
sweet
malts
thats
it
this
review
was
generous
i
know
ledt
hand
is
capable
of
better
just
not
thrilled
with
the
style
overall
the
one
time
i
had
this
beer
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
a
week
or
two
and
i
thought
that
made
it
as
flat
as
it
was
maybe
its
just
not
that
great
a
beer
based
on
its
ratings
id
try
it
again
just
to
see
but
if
its
in
the
neighborhood
of
where
i
had
it
the
first
time
id
say
its
just
an
okay
beer
malt
forward
beer
balanced
by
hops
not
much
of
a
head
though
looks
better
than
it
tastes
but
the
bottles
were
past
best
by
taste
is
what
turned
me
off
tasted
like
bad
weak
tea
not
skunked
but
not
sure
if
the
taste
was
impaired
by
age
not
a
brew
id
do
again
poured
aggressively
from
bottle
into
my
favorite
tulip
i
usually
enjoy
nitros
but
this
was
very
flat
and
not
too
flavorful
decent
hop
aroma
but
uninspiring
thin
almost
watery
grassy
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
enjoy
the
left
hand
milk
stout
nitro
very
much
but
the
sawtooth
is
a
miss
for
me
oh
well
i
like
nitros
but
this
one
seemed
flat
tasted
grassy
bought
a
sampler
six
and
this
was
my
least
favorite
i
was
actually
surprised
how
bad
this
was
o
i
enjoyed
the
brew
but
there
are
many
other
esbs
that
id
seek
before
this
one
bottle
says
to
pour
hard
i
did
and
as
an
esb
i
got
very
little
head
and
golden
amber
color
that
did
not
impress
flavor
up
front
was
malt
sweetness
flavor
was
sort
of
flat
not
very
bitter
and
overall
seemed
to
be
watered
down
also
felt
flat
on
the
palate
and
definitely
lacked
something
was
very
week
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
ok
example
of
the
style
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
in
a
really
good
direction
but
when
it
got
to
the
taste
it
seemed
to
go
off
course
and
that
made
it
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
very
creamy
a
little
velvety
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
on
would
be
enough
for
me
i
dont
really
have
the
urge
to
drink
another
one
right
now
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
nice
and
it
was
what
i
wish
the
taste
was
like
it
was
the
highlight
og
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
also
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
it
could
be
im
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
and
i
would
say
its
worth
trying
to
see
where
you
stand
with
it
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
this
beer
i
started
to
expect
some
good
things
after
that
nice
aroma
but
i
was
let
down
when
i
got
to
the
taste
this
isnt
my
favorite
left
hand
beer
and
its
by
far
not
a
favorite
esb
in
the
end
i
did
think
the
nitro
aspect
was
nice
and
i
will
have
to
try
the
regular
version
and
the
nitro
side
by
side
one
of
these
days
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
think
with
a
just
a
little
bit
of
work
this
could
be
a
pretty
good
beer
beautiful
golden
brown
hue
incredibly
smooth
the
nitro
system
produces
a
fantastic
mouth
feel
and
superb
longlasting
creamy
head
pours
a
clear
amber
with
an
orange
tint
the
head
is
creamy
white
but
a
little
thin
given
the
nitro
pour
the
aroma
is
almost
a
blank
slate
with
just
a
bare
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
equally
bland
the
body
does
have
a
nice
weight
and
silky
feel
courtesy
of
the
nitro
given
the
quality
of
the
nitro
milk
stout
this
one
is
big
letdown
seemingly
thick
on
the
early
palate
its
finish
dissolves
effortlessly
and
allows
the
beer
to
finish
semidry
highlighting
a
broad
and
woodsy
bitterness
for
a
smooth
and
delicate
finish
a
return
of
biscuit
and
orange
keep
the
palate
rewarded
in
aftertaste
o
nicely
done
esb
i
think
the
nitro
is
a
little
lacking
though
i
tried
a
vigorous
pour
slightly
sweet
but
overall
well
done

i
like
that

has
started
putting
these
beers
out
on
nitro
although
im
not
sure
its
as
good
as
a
real
nitro
tap
in
fact
its
definitely
not
while
the
beer
looks
really
nice
the
liquid
itself
is
rather
flat
after
all
the
little
nitro
bubbles
come
out
clear
copper
color
whipped
cream
head
the
nose
is
a
little
more
malty
than
i
remember
sawtooth
being
in
fact
its
got
an
almost
metallic
vibe
but
its
not
at
all
unpleasant
english
ale
yeast
breaks
down
most
of
the
sweetness
and
a
very
clean
and
clear
beer
results
very
autumnal
in
nature
with
a
hearty
body
and
flavors
of
fresh
grain
and
faint
cider
i
prefer
the
nonnitro
edition
and
here
is
why
sawtooth
is
made
by
its
feel
and
that
lively
carbonation
is
has
is
missed
here
the
smoother
but
stiller
nitro
makes
it
more
like
a
classic
esb
but
the
regular
version
is
more
intriguing
to
me
keenly
skirting
style
guidelines
in
favor
of
an
attention
holding
session
ale
this
is
a
little
more
generic
despite
the
format
still
a
worthwhile
endeavor
poured
this
nitro
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
hard
pour
to
activate
the
nitro
action
sadly
this
one
really
fell
flat
literally
which
is
a
pity
since
i
love
regular
sawtooth
ale
carbonation
was
lacking
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
the
delicious
smooth
slightly
sweet
taste
present
in
regular
sawtooth
but
was
a
week
presence
in
this
nitro
version
o
nitro
lends
to
a
great
appearance
and
mouthfeel
although
potentially
at
the
expense
of
smell
and
taste
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
esb
style
good
nutty
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
touch

and

note

i
had
this
with
a
fatty
hotdog
dish
i
threw
together
and
it
was
a
very
nice
bitter
bite
to
accompany
the
sweet
mustard
notes
of
the
sauce
i
prepared
since
i
like
to
drink
my
beer
separately
i
dont
change
my
overall
analysis
but
i
did
want
to
add
that
this
beer
has
decent
promise
as
a
something
to
have
with
a
meal
with
robust
bright
flavors
its
okay
but
has
a
butterscotch
twang
that
im
not
too
fond
of
o
a
very
good
beer
here
well
balanced
and
good
abv
make
this
a
pretty
session
worthy
beer

d
solid
beer
and
super
drinkable
overall
a
smooth
and
decent
example
of
of
the
style
with
a
big
emphasis
on
the
improvement
in
feel
this
nitro
pour
simulates
a
tap
pretty
damn
well
o
i
picked
this
up
as
well
as
the
nonnitro
version
at
the
same
time
i
bought
both
milk
stouts
from
left
hand
my
plan
was
to
compare
both
styles
and
see
how
that
effects
flavor
etc
while
the
flavor
here
may
be
crisper
and
smoother
than
the
original
it
seems
as
though
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
this
bottle
detracts
from
the
brew
more
than
one
would
think
i
think
in
the
future
ill
stick
with
the
original
overall
its
got
some
interesting
qualities
but
i
dont
think
the
deliver
system
is
giving
this
thing
justice
i
am
not
so
worried
about
the
age
dating
on
this
but
there
might
be
a
better
way
to
do
this
i
guess
the
nitro
consistency
is
the
point
of
this
beer
anyway
which
is
as
close
to
the
real
thing
as
you
can
hope
for
o
its
a
decent
party
beer
no
more
no
less
if
someone
buys
a
case
of
this
other
than
me
for
obvious
reasons
bland
esb
for
a
celebration
and
its
the
only
thing
available
damn
right
ill
kill
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
it
went
fast
and
i
wish
i
had
another
or
a
larger
bottle
at
least
simple
well
done
flavor
profile
tastecreamy
mouthfeel
floral
hop
note
toasted
malt
finishes
clean
and
quiet
a
nice
effort
but
i
wished
for
a
little
more
flavor
profile
a
nitro
ipa
would
fit
the
bill
nicely
hint
hint
perhaps
what
i
purchased
was
flawed
but
with
delivery
of
head
and
retention
of
same
it
wasnt
flat
in
any
case
i
wont
bother
to
sample
it
again
too
many
others
out
there
to
look
into
so
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
last
night
what
a
letdown
i
probably
should
have
expected
it
to
be
nothing
like
the
original
sawtooth
i
really
hate
to
say
anything
bad
about
left
hand
but
the
nitro
sawtooth
was
very
underwhelming
pretty
much
indistinguishable
from
an
old
speckled
hen
this
beer
need
more
hops
really
nice
balanced
ale
just
enough
sweetness
and
hops
hands
down
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
the
body
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
velvety
due
to
the
nitro
with
a
low
but
soft
carbonation
and
super
clean
finish
the
hops
longer
for
a
moment
but
are
neither
floral
nor
super
bitter
more
of
a
compliment
than
a
focus
point
overall
i
tend
to
like
left
hands
nonnitro
versions
but
this
is
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
sawtooth
ale
nice
creamy
smooth
and
tasty
beer
very
good
session
ale
with
a
dry
finish
that
make
you
want
to
take
another
sip
this
beer
is
good
and
clean
smells
amazingbut
wasnt
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
not
even
e
n
the
best
beer
i
had
tonight
love
it
great
flavor
dry
hoppy
o
very
nice
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
bitterness
overall
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
a
great
introductory
craft
brew
i
like
the
sweetness
of
the
flavor
with
a
brown
sugar
characteristic
caramel
and
bread
and
a
muted
but
dry
hop
bitterness
nicely
balanced

i
love
left
hand
milk
stout
this
is
my
second
offering
from
left
hand
and
it
is
no
where
near
the
milk
stout
the
flavors
are
muted
the
aroma
is
even
more
muted
a
recent
reviewer
wondered
if
he
stumbled
upon
a
bad
batch
i
think
we
got
the
same
one
no
flavor
at
all
thankfully
i
just
purchased
a
single
drain
pour
not
sure
if
i
had
a
bad
batch
but
it
tastes
like
dirty
river
water
smelled
sweet
and
doughy
tasted
smooth
and
a
little
on
the
stoutporter
side
finished
thin
and
easy
very
good
would
buy
this
one
again
smell
and
taste
are
bland
one
of
all
time
favorites
from
a
brewery
im
dying
to
get
to
overall
what
a
delicious
englishstyle
esb
malty
and
slightly
sweet
its
a
maltbomb
for
sure
its
another
excellent
beer
from
colorado
and
another
excellent
beer
from
left
hand
which
is
fastley
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
colorado
breweries
beer
very
smooth
on
nitro
pours
hazy
with
little
head
malty
fruity
aroma
with
bread
yeast
note
malt
and
biscuit
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
slight
lingering
bitterness
one
of
my
favorites
from
left
hand
excellent
example
of
an
esb
as
far
as
im
concerned
delicate
malty
with
a
hint
of
floral
and
piney
hops
to
balance
would
buy
six
packs
of
this
for
the
fall
overall
a
sessionable
esbamber
ale
that
will
not
provide
a
lot
of
punch
with
maltiness
or
hoppiness
but
is
very
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
pours
nicely
with
a
decent
head
nice
honey
color
subtle
biscuity
nose
slight
carbonation
and
caramel
in
the
front
but
then
nothing
much
disappointing
finish
nothing
offensive
but
rather
a
boring
beer
wont
buy
again
but
will
save
to
serve
to
friends
who
dont
like
beer
im
not
a
huge
esb
guy
but
this
ones
pretty
good
its
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
and
it
is
very
drinkable
on
its
own
this
is
another
beer
that
left
hand
has
made
as
a
nitro
so
id
like
to
give
that
a
shot
to
see
how
different
it
tastes
i
like
other
brews
from
this
brewery
more
but
im
ok
with
this
one
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
beyond
my
usual
try
the
nitro
enjoyable
same
basic
flavor
as
the
nitro
but
the
nitro
is
soso
much
better
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
shortlasting
creamy
white
head
that
still
managed
to
leave
some
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
bland
with
just
a
faint
hint
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
equally
lifeless
it
doesnt
quite
qualify
for
ok
based
on
the
flavoraroma
profile
if
it
doesnt
taste
good
whats
the
point
this
was
truly
a
treat
not
at
all
what
i
thought
it
would
be
like
from

what
i
know
about
esbs
ive
had
redhook
beforeand
i
expected
a
pacific
northwestwest
coast
hop
slam
to
my
mouth
but
this
was
so
malty
and
well
rounded
that
im
going
to
have
to
pick
up
some
more
try
this
beer
flavors
of
bisucit

minimal
the
smell
is
malty
sweet
cloying
ehhh
nothing
great
the
taste
is
definitely
sweet
there
is
a
bready
feel
to
this
one
there
is
a
dryness
that
complements
the
sweetness
and
rounds
things
out
a
bit
there
is
some
hop
on
the
back
end
but
you
need
to
really
search
for
it
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
average
quite
frankly
i
was
disappointed
thinking
this
was
so
much
more
in
part
this
is
due
to
the
ubiquitous
availability
of
left
hand
which
seems
to
be
on
the
shelves
everywhere
as
the
beer
warms
im
getting
a
goodly
dose
of
caramel
and
leather
this
one
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
1
head
that
reduced
into
a
very
thin
collar
big
bubbles
eat
up
little
bubbles
and
yield
tight
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
toast
and
citrus
bitterness
taste
is
biscuity
and
sweet
with
grassy
hop
notes
in
the
finish
fruit
flavors
like
pear
and
citrus
are
present
medium
bodied
a
fine
beer
tasty
without
being
overpowering
anyways
the
sawtooth
has
a
inviting
orangetawny
color
but
the
head
is
small
and
fizzles
out
quick
the
co2
fizzle
also
made
the
mouthfeel
less
pleasurable
but
still
good
this
beer
on
nitro
or
hand
pull
would
be
outstanding
the
aroma
is
malt
balanced
with
caramel
and
light
roast
type
notes
the
hops
are
subdued
and
there
is
a
light
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
that
follows
throught
in
to
the
flavor
i
like
this
beer
alot
and
find
it
quite
easy
to
drink
the
colour
was
amber
and
it
poured
with
a
centimeter
of
creamy
foam
my
first
impression
of
the
smell
was
how
much
like
an
ipa
it
was
with
that
sticky
citric
and
yeast
whiff
as
well
as
notes
of
plums
and
licoricetoffee
the
taste
had
a
kind
of
lemon
note
to
it
with
a
bitter
bite
at
the
end
the
weak
point
was
the
lack
of
body
which
allowed
for
a
certain
amount
of
bad
and
flat
mineral
water
character
maybe
fixable
through
a
more
generous
dose
of
malts
a
fine
sessionbrew
nice
try
but
no
cigar
a
highly
drinkable
and
very
american
ale
this
takes
like
an
american
pale
ale
to
me
a
decent
beer
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
an
esb
wellbalanced
and
on
the
spot
for
flavor
a
tame
esb
with
a
rather
flavorless
hop
profile
despite
the
obligatory
spice
for
the
style
nothing
memorable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
lower
levels
of
very
fine
carbonation
bubbles
goes
down
easily
and
well
this
is
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
makes
a
great
session
brew
however
i
think
that
there
are
better
examples
out
there
definitely
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
again
until
ive
tried
other
brews
of
the
same
style
in
my
opinion
moondog
from
glbc
is
better
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
yet
there
is
nothing
that
makes
me
go
wow
either
overall
an
easy
drinker
that
makes
for
a
good
long
session
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
become
my
standard
replacing
rogues
dead
guy
ale
for
a
daily
drinker
not
outstanind
in
any
single
way
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
cheers
a
nice
brew
not
spectacular
but
certainly
worthwhile
for
a
lower
alcohol
brew
this
aint
a
bad
choice
malt
is
big
here
slightly
sweet
and
toasted
fruit
and
biscuit
some
hops
but
not
very
powerful
okay
balance
a
little
watery
in
the
mouthfeel
and
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
diacetyl
note
good
bitter
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
with
the
hops
and
malt
both
getting
equal
billing
it
reminded
me
of
a
cleaner
version
of
their
pale
ale
to
be
honest
somewhat
fruity
in
spots
and
caramelsweet
in
others
overall
a
wellbalanced
and
solid
esb
drinkability
highly
drinkable
an
abv
less
than
5
with
good
taste
makes
this
one
very
sessionable
as
well
i
am
definistely
happy
to
see
this
in
nebraska
and
will
have
to
make
a
6
pack
purchase
next
time
d
a
very
nice
esb
one
of
the
better
beers
from
left
hand
easy
on
the
tongue
not
too
sweet
good
hop
bittering
balance
drinkability
is
quite
high
the
beer
is
lightbodied
but
shows
some
complexity
with
the
contrast
of
the
caramel
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
very
drinkable
and
overall
a
solid
brew
poured
a
dark
orange
copper
colour
with
a
nice
looking
pillowy
head
nice
head
retention
on
this
one
with
that
good
looking
foamy
cap
hanging
around
for
several
minutes
smell
was
both
a
floral
hoppy
as
well
as
some
definite
sweet
malt
making
for
a
well
balanced
smelling
brew
taste
too
was
very
well
balanced
with
a
pronounced
but
not
too
assertive
hoppy
profile
up
front
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
and
a
nice
subtle
sweet
malt
turning
to
dry
biscuity
malt
on
the
finish
i
was
rather
impressed
with
this
offering
and
i
must
admit
i
went
into
this
thinking
i
wasnt
going
to
care
much
for
it
shame
on
me
as
this
turned
out
to
be
a
good
beer
as
well
as
a
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
this
is
an
excellent
esb
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
d
a
satisfying
nofrills
all
a
fair
example
of
the
style
that
id
probably
get
again
this
is
also
very
much
true
of
the
taste
but
it
is
followed
by
a
nice
but
mild
bitterness
it
all
balances
out
very
well
its
light
to
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
never
a
bad
decision
drinkability
is
good
nice
brew
although
not
100
inline
with
the
style
is
represents
poured
medium
amber
color
three
finger
light
tan
head
held
very
well
with
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
pine
hops
tasted
more
like
a
ipa
than
a
esb
some
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malts
with
some
hop
balance
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
and
carbonation
ok
didnt
like
the
fact
i
thought
i
was
buying
a
esb
and
got
something
else
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
pours
a
nice
redorange
with
a
lively
light
beige
head
carbonation
was
good
and
those
nice
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
persisted
until
all
the
drink
had
been
drunk
dissipated
head
left
a
sticky
ring
of
lace
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
hoppiness
is
nice
and
round
not
crisp
and
contain
hints
of
citrus
overall
a
very
balanced
beer
sure
to
please
many
a
palate
pours
with
a
surprisingly
thick
2
finger
head
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
it
is
a
light
amber
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
mostly
malts
and
that
is
what
comes
though
in
the
mouth
i
would
like
a
little
more
hops
this
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
there
are
good
flavors
but
something
seems
to
be
lacking
i
suspect
that
i
could
give
this
to
my
father
in
law
the
wine
drinker
and
i
dont
think
he
would
have
a
problem
i
could
see
drinking
this
at
a
baseball
game
or
some
other
hot
day
a
nice
beer
and
worth
trying
but
not
one
i
will
buy
again
the
beer
is
ok
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
night
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
gentle
carbonation
only
4
75
abv
but
not
something
i
could
session
on
d
i
really
like
it
and
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
ive
tasted
left
hands
imperial
stout
and
i
know
they
can
craft
a
decent
brew
but
a
forprofit
brewery
should
not
be
letting
this
kind
of
thing
happen
drinkability
a
very
mellow
and
easy
drinking
amber
ale
a
descent
amount
of
complexity
allows
for
an
interesting
evening
while
it
retains
enough
simplicity
to
be
quaffed
with
a
few
friends
over
dinner
this
brew
pours
to
a
slightly
hazy
dull
amber
color
with
a
nice
sized
head
that
has
pretty
good
retention
and
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
at
the
top
pf
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nice
lots
of
malt
come
through
with
biscuit
and
caramel
scents
also
i
am
picking
up
a
nice
hop
aroma
that
while
subtle
is
there
and
mixes
very
nicely
this
is
a
very
good
aromatic
brew
very
inviting
the
taste
while
very
nice
seems
to
be
missing
my
expectation
from
the
aromas
i
was
expecting
a
more
robust
flavor
but
is
seems
somewhat
dull
while
this
being
said
it
is
a
nice
tasting
brew
just
does
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
some
hop
taste
up
front
is
noticeable
but
does
not
live
up
to
the
smell
agree
that
for
this
style
that
they
should
not
be
overwhelming
but
should
have
a
little
better
punch
imo
also
the
malts
seem
to
be
somewhat
bland
and
i
feel
that
this
is
what
is
causing
my
thoughts
on
this
brew
to
be
soso
somewhat
sweet
flavor
but
very
plain
to
almost
feeling
watery
i
would
say
that
this
brew
is
fair
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
fair
choice
for
a
sessional
brew
a
middle
of
the
road
esb
from
left
hand
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
enjoyed
it
just
the
same
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
very
smooth
east
to
drink
esb
not
as
harsh
as
others
of
this
style
that
ive
experienced
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
during
a
session
overall
this
one
was
kind
of
a
surprise
but
the
kind
of
good
surprise
im
experiencing
more
and
more
lately
a
good
from
left
field
no
pun
intended
solid
pale
ale
that
definitely
worth
your
time
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
with
a
decent
persistent
head
the
smell
is
quite
malty
with
a
touch
of
bitter
notes
the
taste
is
malty
and
bitter
it
is
a
good
balance
between
the
two
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
carbonation
is
noticeable
the
balance
of
this
beer
along
with
its
body
makes
this
a
nice
drinking
beer
overall
im
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
like
to
try
it
again
this
beer
was
a
nice
surprise
not
very
familiar
with
esbs
but
i
found
this
very
drinkable
the
copper
color
had
a
big
tan
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
head
settled
down
to
a
half
inch
or
less
this
beer
had
a
light
hop
and
faint
fruit
and
red
grapefruit
i
found
this
beer
to
finish
nicely
and
while
this
may
be
considered
average
i
enjoyed
the
brew
nothing
necessarily
memorable
but
a
good
solid
beer
and
very
drinkable
not
overbearing
enjoyed
it
and
a
fun
change
of
pace
pours
a
nicel
clear
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
one
finger
foamy
tannish
head
which
then
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacying
afterwards
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
hoppy
and
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
slightly
hoppy
and
a
nice
undertone
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
esb
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
out
taste
seems
a
bit
thin
but
its
nothing
to
sneeze
at
i
was
coming
off
a
sample
of
rogues
brutal
bitter
hops
are
prominent
but
not
supersharp
they
retreat
quickly
settling
way
in
the
the
back
of
the
mouth
malts
are
mild
and
theres
a
decent
balance
between
hops
and
malt

good

a
really
competent
brew
mouthfeel
was
very
light
but
unremarkable
md
body
and
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
and
way
overcarbonated
for
the
style
unfortunately
i
found
another
beer
that
has
the
tealike
metallic
bitterness
that
i
just
dont
like
i
usually
find
these
flavors
in
english
ales
and
many
us
ambers
dont
know
if
its
the
hops
or
the
malt
that
gives
it
the
flavor
that
i
dont
like
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
one
it
is
tasty
low
in
abv
and
could
be
very
session
worthy
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
a
brewed
on
date
on
the
front
label
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
clear
cooper
it
had
a
average
head
that
dissipated
into
a
permanent
thin
head
mild
carbonation
got
this
as
part
of
a
sampler
and
i
know
that
2
of
the
others
had
something
off
in
the
smell
department
so
guessing
this
one
is
off
a
little
as
well
as
a
result
nothing
really
stands
out
but
good
background
aromas
will
rerate
flavor
after
better
sample
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
standard
the
taste
was
really
good
and
improved
as
it
warmed
up
started
too
cold
damn
mini
fridge
esbs
traditionally
havent
been
my
favorites
but
ive
been
tasting
a
lot
of
them
lately
and
they
are
growing
on
me
this
one
rates
up
their
with
the
best
ive
had
so
far
not
a
surprise
since
its
from
left
hand
which
is
vaulting
to
the
top
of
my
favorite
breweries
list
going
for
a
tour
in
feb
and
cant
wait
highly
recommend
4
rr
ty
overall
impression
a
fair
beer
not
a
style
that
i
get
too
excited
about
but
this
is
a
good
representation
in
my
book
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
clear
copper
with
good
head
for
a
while
pretty
nice
lacing
aroma
is
subtle
but
nicely
fruity
with
pale
malt
taste
is
nicely
bitter
floral
and
fruity
and
pale
malts
some
grapefruit
good
body
i
guess
and
overall
just
a
pretty
good
beer
beer
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
strong
white
head
that
is
leaving
lacing
behind
nose
is
heavily
perfumed
with
sweet
malts
taste
leans
more
toward
the
malty
side
than
the
bitter
side
although
there
is
a
decent
hop
finish
left
lingering
mouthfeel
is
resonably
full
for
the
style
and
it
is
fresh
and
lively
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
good
the
lower
abv
makes
this
an
interesting
sessionable
beer
recommended
to
esb
fans
da
pretty
good
esb
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
and
would
have
it
again
drinkability
would
be
a
great
session
beer
but
for
the
astringency
the
beer
has
a
slightly
slick
and
thick
mouth
this
is
a
session
beer
for
sure
easy
drinking
enjoyable
beer
could
be
divine
on
cask
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
but
decent
drinkability
would
seem
to
be
a
good
session
beer
slides
down
easy
nice
dose
of
flavor
but
highly
quaffable
perhaps
a
bit
too
dry
on
the
finish
for
my
taste
for
an
esb
but
im
getting
picky
very
nicely
done
beer
overall
different
from
other
esbs
ive
tried
but
nonetheless
nice
and
enjoyable
this
is
the
first
beer
that
the
fellas
at
left
hand
ever
brewed
and
imo
its
their
best
offering
by
far
its
a
good
beer
but
i
have
concerns
whether
it
will
be
memorable
enough
my
bottle
came
out
of
left
hands
mixer
and
according
to
the
stamp
on
the
bottle
its
only
a
month
old
dvery
nice
for
a
light
session
pretty
tasty
and
really
easy
to
drink
strong
malty
base
with
spicy
understones
hops
aroma
and
presence
is
good
fills
the
nose
when
held
there
for
a
bit
but
understated
compared
to
the
malt
giving
a
slightly
sweet
taste
the
light
golden
colored
ale
is
also
a
bit
light
in
the
mouth
but
not
bad
front
end
carbonation
bite
that
goes
flat
off
the
back
of
the
tongue
good
taste
to
the
beer
but
not
multidimensional
and
a
beer
to
get
when
it
pops
up
but
dont
hunt
it
down
a
very
easydrinking
beer
im
thinking
this
would
be
very
good
for
sessioning
not
so
much
flavor
that
your
palate
gets
tired
but
enough
there
to
keep
your
tastebuds
interested
with
a
low
enoug
abv
that
you
could
still
stand
after
a
few
it
looks
nice
enough
and
smells
even
better
but
the
flavor
is
a
disappointment
its
a
shame
it
doesnt
deliver
more
the
disconnect
from
smelling
to
drinking
causes
a
stark
dropoff
and
such
a
let
down
is
hard
to
get
past
still
its
not
totally
devoid
of
drinkability
its
just
that
you
come
away
thinking
it
could
have
been
so
much
more
this
beer
actually
suprised
me
a
little
as
i
was
expecting
something
average
to
mediocre
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
without
being
too
over
the
top
in
any
area
as
some
brewers
attempt
it
has
a
great
drinkability
and
is
something
i
would
pick
up
in
a
heartbeat
for
a
good
malty
session
beer
would
love
to
find
it
on
draft
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
amber
color
with
one
inch
white
head
that
leaves
little
lace
smell
is
of
malted
barley
with
hint
of
some
citrus
smells
taste
is
of
a
bitter
malt
with
hints
with
some
wheat
in
the
background
very
good
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
leaves
a
good
aftertaste
as
well
another
good
brew
from
left
hand
brewing
company
d
it
is
so
balanced
and
uncomplicated
it
seems
over
before
it
began
i
was
done
before
i
could
really
decide
if
it
compared
with
some
of
the
other
esbs
out
there
that
could
be
a
good
thing
id
grab
it
again
but
i
think
i
prefer
redhook
more
citrus
hops
and
chalkydoughy
malts
thought
throughout
the
drinking
experience
that
it
was
rather
uneventful
nice
and
goes
down
smooth
and
drinkable
enough
just
not
something
id
knock
anyone
over
to
try
again
this
was
a
weird
beer
to
drink
i
have
never
been
into
esbs
and
this
came
in
a
sampl
pack
so
im
giving
it
a
try
purs
an
amber
color
into
my
glass
with
a
sligh
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
lacing
small
is
of
slight
pine
more
bread
chalky
malts
smells
ok
but
something
is
off
the
taste
was
of
a
nutty
slightly
hoppy
and
sweet
flavor
some
kinda
buttery
caramel
was
the
main
flavors
i
think
i
might
have
gotten
an
old
batch
of
this
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
coating
and
weight
the
drinkablity
is
average
right
now
im
going
to
have
to
review
this
beer
again
for
a
full
picture
now
overall
it
is
an
easy
drinking
esb
though
with
the
nutty
and
maybe
a
slight
spice
being
the
main
flavors
comments
a
very
good
bitter
in
its
own
right
but
i
am
partial
to
the
draft
version
of
this
beer
dark
gold
or
copper
colour
in
the
glass
offwhite
head
that
settled
quickly
a
strange
aroma
sort
of
grassy
and
earthy
flavour
is
a
little
odd
as
well
i
opened
a
couple
of
them
to
see
if
they
all
tasted
like
that
my
first
impression
was
that
it
tasted
a
lot
like
iced
tea
sweet
biscuity
malt
flavours
to
start
with
some
light
pine
and
fruitiness
it
finishes
quite
dry
but
with
only
a
light
hoppiness
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
just
cant
get
rid
of
that
tealike
flavour
that
i
seem
to
get
from
it
maybe
ill
give
it
a
try
again
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
12
oz
bottle
beer
was
a
dark
gold
color
crystal
clear
moderate
size
head
off
white
in
color
aroma
was
malt
on
top
with
some
citrus
style
of
hops
coming
through
as
well
as
i
inhaled
i
also
picked
up
a
vinegar
smell
made
me
wonder
about
the
beer
i
pushed
on
to
tasting
where
the
hops
outweighed
the
malt
quite
a
bit
sweetness
only
came
through
towards
the
end
for
me
primarily
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
fairly
drying
and
the
carbonation
seemed
rather
high
body
was
light
and
it
was
fairly
refreshing
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
wasnt
that
impressed
and
the
smell
was
rather
offputting
i
will
probably
try
again
in
case
this
one
was
damaged
in
some
way
poured
from
12
0z
bottle
reddish
apearance
true
to
style
but
little
head
and
no

bitter
throughout
as
expected
with
a
very
dry
palate
to
begin
with
that
but
became
less
so
near
the
end
left
a
good
finish
not
my
favorite
beer
but
at
4

abv
a
good
one
to
have
if
drinking
several
drinakability
was
average
just
a
rather
bland
brew
nothing
offensive
just
not
one
that
captures
your
imagination
or
leaves
you
wanting
another
very
much
recommend
this
beer
for
a
nice
balance
and
fresh
flavor
i
dont
know
how
i
really
feel
about
this
one
i
guess
it
is
ok
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
really
shine
in
any
areas

12

in
a
nonic
it
pours
a
solid
chestnut
hue
with
a
finger
of
khaki
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
but
retains
a
14
cap
of
bubbles
throughout
the
aroma
is
of
citricpineyfloral
hops
sweetbuttery
malts
dark
fruits
and
roastedchocolate

the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
the
addition
of
tropical
grapefruit
orange
faint
mango
hops
that
contribute
a
mild
to
medium
bitterness
on

of
a
medium

that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
it
is
a
morethanadequate
esb
that
is
quite
balanced
in
both
scent
and
flavor
definitely
worth
the
price
and
im
sure
it
would
make
a
great
session
brew
mouthfeel
was
a
full
medium
body
probably
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
flavor
really
lingered
good
drinkability
overall
a
fairly
solid
esb
that
was
nonoffensive
in
the
taste
department

still
went
down

above

take
on

a

find

id
perhaps
like
a
more
pronounced

malt
presence

the
absence
of
these
doesnt
break
the
beer
its
good
o
a
decent
beer
nothing
extraordinary
but
its
worth
trying
poured
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
that
left
no
lacing
it
looks
decent
but
not
spectacular
scents
of
caramel
fruity
esters
apple
tea
and
some
floral
hops
a
nice
appealing
pub
ale
aroma
nothing
too
complex
but
balanced
and
inviting
taste
begins
with
some
nice
caramel
malt
before
moving
into
floral
hop
bitterness
that
is
sustained
throughout
there
is
also
a
distinct
herbal
hop
flavor
and
some
pine
resin
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
on
the
finish
and
aftertaste
along
with
bitter
hops
the
overall
flavor
is
rather
bitter
for
an
esb
but
its
not
bad
a
little
more
sweet
malt
would
make
it
better
though
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
lightly
carbonation

semidrying
with
a

overall
this
is
a
nice
esb
and
hits
all
the
notes
i
want
this
esb
has
a
great
balance
and
is
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
its
not
big
and
or
bold
but
it
has
very
nice
balance
and
subtle
complexity
as
noted
above
it
has
more
and
better
hop
character
than
that
beer
they
call
an
ipa
the
body
is
odd
some
sweetness
up
front
but
finishes
dry
carbonation
is
light
but
good
for
style
overall
i
would
like
a
bit
more
english
character
in
the
malt
hops
and
yeast
but
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
dark
amber
or
light
brown
in
color
it
has
an
autumn
orange
type
of
hue
similar
to
some
wood
furniture
you
see
some
prickle
and
little
to
no
head
malty
nose
with
a
faint
hint
of
hops
the
attack
is
clean
but
then
the
flavor
hammers
you
with
a
strong
bitter
nut
flavor
the
nut
and
the
bitter
would
be
fine
in
the
correct
proportions
and
balance
but
it
seems
that
the
nut
overpowers
the
bitter
and
i
dont
feel
that
its
a
good
thing
the
aftertaste
is
consistent
with
the
flavor
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
when
you
get
the
nuts
in
the
mixed
nuts
around
thanksgiving
that
are
dried
or
gone
bad
and
they
give
a
huge
tart
flavor
that
dries
the
mouth
i
am
appreciative
that
my
father
hauled
this
beer
to
me
from
alaska
but
its
not
my
favorite
of
those
he
brought
me
d
very
drinkable
definitely
one
to
session
on
sample
in
the
alaskan
tap
room
this
brew
is
a
lightly
hazed
copper
color
with
a
medium
thin
and
foamy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
steadily

on
the

earthy
malt
aroma
mediumbodied
and
moderately
bitter
with

caramel
and

flavors
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
lingering
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
mix
above
average
overall
notes
from
112705
it
began
with
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
mediumtan
head
with
low
retention
but
a
good
bit
of
lacing
nose
had
a
good
bit
of
caramel
accompanied
by
a
mild
bitterness
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
bitterness
softly
tempered
by
a
caramelmalt
sweetness
finish
had
the
same
commingling
of
bitter
and
sweet
that
i
got
on
the
tongue
in
fact
as
it
warmed
i
got
a
really
pronounced
biscuitiness
on
the
extreme
finish
a
very
good
esb
and
a
beer
that
nicely
offset
their
amber
the
esb
is
crisp
and
smooth
rich
enough
mouthfeel
for
the
style
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
balances
everything
out
drinkability
is
really
good
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
that
goes
down
real
easy
an
ideal
session
beer
and
a
good
transition
from
swill
to
a
well
constructed
beer
with
an
actual
flavor
d
very
nice
beer
not
overpowering
thank
you
i
will
have
another
this
is
an
excellent
concoction
by
ak
it
has
incredible
hop
flavor
and
all
the
bitterness
the
hopheads
like
pours
dark
yet
transparent
amber
with
good
carbonation
i
like
the
initial
hop
taste
that
really
kicks
your
ass
suprisingly
drinkable
for
an
esb
many
will
mistake
it
for
an
ipa
aside
from
the
color
the
finish
shows
a
little
malt
but
still
very
hoppy
great
brew
the
first
beer
that
i
had
after
getting
off
the
plane
in
las
vegas
this
turned
out
to
be
a
pure
simple
and
very
desirable
beer
it
pours
a
brilliant
sparkling
copper
amber
hue
with
a
steady
offwhite
head
formation
that
laced
well
as
the
beer
line
fell
moderate
aromas
of
caramel
malts
and
aletypical
fruity
esters
mild
fermented
flavors
swirl
around
the
malts
for
a
rich
aroma
flavor
and
feel
an
herbal
pungent
english
hop
character
cleans
the
beer
up
a
bit
while
offering
some
complexity
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
not
preferencing
the
hops
nor
the
malts
the
feel
is
also
moderate
not
too
heavy
or
thick
but
not
watering
either
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
mild
hop
lingering
and
flavor
i
certainly
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
beer
again
d
richness
of
brew
my
make
it
hard
to
session
but
absolutely
delicious
beer
and
an
fine
example
of
an
esb
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
alaskan
brews
perfect
balance
of
boldness
and
drinkability
makes
a
great
beer
batter
and
compliments
alaskan
seafood
perfectly
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
easily
drinkable
fizzy
carbonation
on
the
tongue
bitter
hops
up
front
a
metallic
astringent
flavor
with
the
the
hops
there
good
malt
balance
slightly
lingers
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
sessionable
brew
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
would
definitely
be
alright
if
i
had
nothing
else
better
it
seemed
more
like
an
american
amber
than
a
true
esb
not
bad
this
ones
pretty
good
thanks
beerrun13
i
must
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
esb
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
a
taste
to
match
with
the
hops
creating
a
pleasant
bitterness
with
a
tangy
sour
flavor
to
match
a
good
taste
but
onelayered
the
bitterness
and
the
sour
is
all
you
get
and
any
deeper
search
for
taste
yields
nothing
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
like
club
soda
its
weak
mouthfeel
lends
itself
to
being
an
easy
drinker
a
positive
aspect
of
this
brew
nothing
horrible
but
you
can
certainly
do
better
as
far
as
the
esb
style
is
concerned
worth
a
try
nothing
youll
find
in
my
fridge
quite
often
though
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
fullflavored
version
of
an
american
macro
maybe
but
it
has
a
distinct
character
as
well
its
not
a
super
beer
but
an
above
average
bitter
just
the
same
d
drinkable
a
nice
little
esb
from
alaskan
would
recommend
the
smell
is
strong
and
full
of
malt
the
taste
is
smooth
starting
with
amber
malts
and
finishing
with
just
enough
hops
to
pronounce
themselves
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
sharp
while
drinkability
is
good
all
in
all
a
very
nice
brew
thats
getting
me
excited
about
what
the
northwest
has
to
offer
small
white
head
very
good
grapefruit
aroma
bitter
more
than
malty
but
overall
balanced
decent
nicely
drinkable
bitter
though
a
bit
watery
a
few
days
after
expirey
though
i
wouldnt
blame
it
on
that
nor
on
liquid
solutions
who
shipped
it
with
just
a
few
weeks
to
go
cheers

some
staying
power
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
tangy
fruity

that
become
more
assertive
as
the
beer
warms
from
fridge
temperature
palate
is
dominated
by
mellow
sweet

accented
slightly
by
some
fruity
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
english
ale
yeast
body
is
just
rich
enough
to
complement
the
flavors
without
being
too
thick
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
more
of
this
all
of
the
alaskan
brewing
company
beers
are
solid
and
drinkable
although
with
the
exception
of
smoked
porter
and
stout
ive
never
been
overly
impressed
it
took
nearly
the
entire
bottle
to
come
to
this
conclusion
but
alaskan
esb
is
my
favorite
nondark
offering
from
this
brewery
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
esb
with
an
american
citric
hop
edge
your
search
ends
here
i
think
the
lack
of
head
may
have
been
due
to
the
pour
coming
from
an
older
bottle
the
tastes
and
feel
held
up
wonderfully
though
bottom
line
a
very
solid
esb
that
ill
gladly
drink
more
of
and
recommend
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
imagine
this
would
be
great
as
a
session
beer
or
with
a
nice
bbq
dinner
or
even
spicy
thai
food
another
tasty
beer
from
alaska
notes
hell
yes
this
is
an
above
average
esb
borderline
greatness
a
bit
more
depth
and
this
would
be
4
good
stuff
the
taste
is
quite
good
with
food
that
theres
a
kind
of
sweet
almost
honey
like
flavor
from
the
malt
that
flavor
is
quickly
over
ran
by
the
hops
which
fill
the
mouth
smoothly
the
star
here
is
the
delectable
smoothness
which
is
kept
interesting
by
spikes
of
hops
and
carbonation
it
feels
grat

it

up
alaskans

a
wellcrafted

finely
balanced
dark

suggests
thats
peppered
with

backed
by

one
of
the
best
american
esbs
ive
ever
had
been
sitting
on
this
beer
for
a
little
bit
its
time
to
drink
it
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
ring
around
the
top
the
nose
is
slightly
citrusy
slightly
dirty
in
the

with

the
flavor
is
pretty
spot

with

though
the
dirty
hop
may
be
a
bit
more
forceful
in
the
flavor
everything
is
pretty
mellow
not
taste
taking

stage
the
feel
is
just
shy
of
moderate

moderate
smooth

not
a

beer
at
all
i
would
really
find
it
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
goes
down
easily
but
not
much
here
to
hold
my
interest
the
drinkability
is
too
watery
for
me
and
can
be
a
session
beer
if
one
likes
the
watery
feel
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
stays
around
long
enough
to
enjoy
the
glass
smell
is
of
hops

yeasty

taste
is

than
a
subtle

lasts

thats

cheers
i
consider
most
esbs
to
be
food
beers
by
that
i
mean
that
they
usually
are
really
good
compliments
of
spicy
food
but
are
not
the
greatest
by
themselves
this
beer
provides
the
example
i
had
two
of
these
one
by
itself
and
one
with
some
spicy
mexican
food
the
flavor
in
this
beer
matched
really
well
with
the
spicyness
of
the
mexican
food
there
was
a
spicy
hop
dominance
in
the
beer
which
was
annoying
alone
but
good
with
food
the
malts
play
a
perfect
role
in
providing
flavor
and
holding
bitterness
back
but
yet
letting
the
hops
do
their
thing
the
bitterness
is
on
the
light
side
but
that
only
means
more
hop
spicyness
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
on
a
acidic
quality
in
there
as
well
the
hops
linger
in
here
lots
of
earthy
flavors
underneath
this
is
a
really
well
made
esb
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
babies
another
great
brew
from
alaskan
brewing
co
another
pleasant
brew
from
alaskan
i
dont
think
they
know
how
to
make
bad
beer
man
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
esb
a
while
ago
alaskan
has
a
quality
brew
here
to
go
with
their
smoked
porter
at
least
with
the
esb
i
can
get
it
yearround
a
first
class
session
brew
with
a
dry
finish
and
great
quenching
qualities
many
thanks
to
my
buddy
pierre
archambault
who
lugged
a
6er
of
this
and
the
amber
back
from
his
expedition
on
the
summit
of
mt
mckinley
poured
a
deep
amber
one
of
the
darkest
bitter
i
have
evere
encountered
head
was
thin
but
lasted
nicely
good
lacing
was
present
nice
malty
and
subtle
hop
aroma
was
apparent
somewhat
grainy
very
smooth
nice

pesence
with
solid
backbone
of
caramel
malts
alaskan
brewing
co
was
always
kind
of
passed
over
by
yours
truly
big
mistake
these
beers
have
become
a
real
joy
to
drink
their
trademark
is
outstanding
smoothness
and
drinkability
and
this
might
be
the
best
domestic
esb
out
there
get
this
fine
ber
if
you
ever
see
it
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
it
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
an
off
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lace
hops
dominate
the
smell
malt
sweetness
is
just
noticeable
under
a
hop
bitterness
that
is
especially
pronounced
at
the
end
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
more
or
less
par
for
the
course
for
an
esb
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
distinguishes
it
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
but
the
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
this
would
be
the
perfect
session
beer
as
the
taste
is
more
than
interesting
enough
to
hold
your
attention

this

for

than
the
traditional

hops
are

creep
up

this
isnt
initally
as
easy
drinking
as

the

i
love
big

with
a

character
this
is
one
of
them
and
a
perfect
pairing
at
lunch
time
would
be
with
a
roast
beef
on
rye
with
horseradish
mayo
this
is
really
one
of
the
only
brews
by
alaskan
that
i
didnt
enjoy
all
that
much

leaving
minimal

this
had
a
taste
of
generic
aspirin
in
the
finish
that
i
just
didnt
like
i
highly
doubt
it
was
a
bad
batch
cuz
all
the
others
i
had
by
alaskan
were
great
had
a
good
smell
of
floral
sweetness
and
light
malt
but
that
didnt
carry
over
in
the
taste
department
for
me
ive
diffenately
had
better
esb
but
esbs
are
not
my
forte
the
color
on
the

is
a

the

again
a
bit
of
a
spicy
hop
taste
emerges
midway
through
very
good
esb
not
exceptional
but
very
good
this
beer
is
a
nice
shade
of
scarlet
red
a
small
creamy
beige
head
recedes
to
a
thin
coating
in
seconds
lacing
is
adequate
the
aroma
is
about
half
and
half
between
piney
hop
notes
and
caramelbiscuity
malt
tones
this
beer
displays
some
nice
balance
for
the
style
and
types
of
hops
utilized
centennial
and
cascade
hops
impart
some
bitterness
piney
tones
and
some
rind
qualities
to
a
lesser
degree
malt
provides
a
beautiful
underlying
and
balance
in
this
beer
although
bread
like
and
doughy
at
times
the
malt
profile
is
primarily
caramel
and
very
nice
beautiful
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
low
drinkability
is
high
its
been
months
since
i
tried
a
beverage
from
alaskan
and
they
have
picked
up
right
where
they
left
off
in
my
mind
very
good
stuff
182
another
great
alaskan
brew
hops
give
a
great
flowery
aroma
and
extemely
smooth
finish
goes
down
real
easy
a
good
esb
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
and
a
flowery
fresh
hop
finish
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
scents
of
roasted
chestnuts
on
the
nose
with
a
floral
hop
note
lacing
with
every
sip
huge
hop
flavor
for
an
esb
a
bit
out
of
balance
for
the
style
toasted
nutty
with
a
hint
of
hazelnuts
on
the
front
with
an
explosion
of
citrusy
hops
on
the
back
very
sessionable
beer
an
especially
nice
in
the
fall
yards
english
style
ales
stand
up
to
the
big
ones
from
great
britain
would
pair
well
with
steak
cask
offering
at
oneals
pub
the
cask
variety
adds
an
element
of
sourness
to
the
normally
bitter
nature
of
this
beer
nice
woody
dried
fruit
aroma
more
dried
fruit
in
the
taste
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
bringing
to
mind
dubbels
and
sours
nicely
done
pours
a
deep
rich
clear
brown
like
nice
handmade
antique
furniture
brown
has
a
good
cap
of
creamy
offwhite
head
that
just
sits
there
throughout
and
provides
a
lot
of
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
dark
bread
malt
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
the
taste
starts
with
the
malt
sweetness
and
transitions
into
the
nice
hops
bitterness
theres
a
great
weight
to
the
body
and
a
silky
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
esb
o
not
a
worldclass
brew
but
a
damn
good
offering
from
fellow
philly
locals
this
one
would
truly
shine
in
a
bar
setting
or
even
at
a
dinner
table
on
its
own
theres
better
choices
but
this
definitely
isnt
disappointing
worth
a
shot
the
flavor
has
a
subtle
toffee
and
toasted
malt
presence
with
yeast
bringing
out
a
woody
hop
flavor
near
the
middle
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
in
the
taste
with
slight
spice
and
creamy
caramel
overall
not
a
bad
beer
pretty
malty
example
of
the
style
and
on
the
high
end
of
the
alcohol
for
and
esb
but
pretty
tasty
i
would
enjoy
this
on
draft
if
offered
overall
very
enjoyable
as
part
of
the
yards
variety
pack
i
enjoy
it
as
often
as
all
the
others
in
the
pack
except
the
brawler
a
good
but
not
great
beer
o
a
very
good
american
representation
of
an
english
style
esb
not
as
malty
sweet
as
it
might
be
or
rather
more
bitter
than
it
might
be
but
that
may
be
the
result
of
the
american
influence
i
would
buy
this
again
next
time
im
in
the
philadelphia
area
since
although
it
is
highly
a
regarded
brewery
in
the
eastern
panj
area
it
is
not
widely
distributed
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
yards
i
much
prefer
the
tavern
ale
tavern
spruce
and
george
washington
tavern
porter
over
this
esa
overalli
may
get
this
again
or
the
ipa
but
most
likely
the
dipa
damn
tasty
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
seems
to
have
a
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
overall
i
am
not
too
happy
with
this
beer
its
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
dont
think
i
will
seek
this
out
in
bottle
again
i
have
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
a
different
experience
a
much
better
one
the
corn
aroma
and
the
bandaid
flavours
really
put
me
off
as
well
as
it
was
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste
and
i
feel
the
style
if
indeed
it
is
an
extra
specialstrong
ale
i
will
still
give
it
a
mid
to
high
3s
out
of
five
its
not
crap
but
its
just
not
for
me
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
malts
taste
is
well
balanced
malts
an
hops
a
bit
light
easy
drinking
but
just
seems
to
be
lacking
any
punch
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
great
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
full
of
malty
goodness
a
slight
bitter
hop
character
tames
the
sweetness
very
soft
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
served
in
a
big
english
imperial
pint
nonic
pulled
from
the
fake
hand
pump
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
sudsy
foam
with
lots
of
lacing
in
the
glass
no
aroma
to
speak
of
winey
and
tastes
like
some
new
kind
of
long
island
iced
tea
on
the
cask
at
local
44
in
philadelphia
interesting
but
i
dont
get
it
transcribed
from
notes
written
on
05302012
visit
o
nicely
brewed
to
style
easily
drinkable
pleasant
flavors
smell
is
strong
noble
hop
and
nice
sweet
malt
taste
is
smooth
easy
hop
and
malt
so
smooth
and
drinkable
really
nice
brew
on
cask
just
not
sure
how
it
would
translate
to
bottle
very
worth
it
from
cask
toffee
malt
and
fruity
esters
on
the
palate
hops
contribute
a
a
pronounced
bitterness
but
one
thats
well
below
ipa
levels
a
slight
solvent
presence
on
the
finish
detracts
from
the
experience
i
think
id
pay
a
little
extra
and
pick
up
some
fullers
esb
over
this
a
fairly
solid
esab
but
the
dark
fruit
seems
to
get
a
bit
more
medicinal
feeling
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
towards
the
end
of
the
experience
still
another
addition
to
a
solid
yards
lineup
from
what
i
have
tasted
o
pretty
good
esb
looks
nice
in
the
glass
and
has
the
right
flavor
a
bit
mild
though
kind
of
an
odd
combination
with
fruity
esters
and
floral
hops
really
dominating
dont
think
ive
had
a
beer
with
more
floral
hop
flavor
the
minerally
quality
and
pretty
bitter
finish
make
things
even
weirder
honestly
all
of
there
beers
were
steller
including
this
one
colour
taste
smell
and
mouth
feel
i
wouldnt
put
at
a
traditional
esb
british
but
for
a
american
take
pretty
spot
on
eh
this
had
a
great
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
as
per
par
and
for
most
british
esbs
in
the
5
3
5
range
at
6
they
hid
this
very
well
a
hint
of
staleness
but
the
flavor
grows
on
you
theres
an
interesting
tangyness
in
the
first
one
i
drank
it
seemed
stronger
maybe
its
what
i
was
eating
airy
bitterness
on
the
finish
lingers
nicely
tangyness
yes
but
very
little
sweetness
which
is
something
i
like
first
drinks
felt
flat
but
then
it
got
a
bit
more
body
do
beers
change
like
wine
after
theyre
open
o
if
i
had
the
option
of
yards
on
long
island
id
be
happy
a
nice
craft
beer
that
could
eaily
lure
the
bmc
crowd
substantial
brew
but
not
my
favorite
from
yards
o
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
love
to
try
on
cask
i
am
really
starting
to
try
esb
and
i
am
really
enjoying
this
definitely
will
be
pick
this
up
again
overall
flavorful
esb
true
to
the
style
for
sure
paired
well
with
my
dinner
of
pork
mashed
potatoes
and
gravy
o
now
that
i
verified
it
is
an
esb
im
quite
impressed
overall
easy
drinking
and
a
pretty
good
taste
a
brew
and
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
a
pretty
good
attempt
of
the
style
but
hop
character
was
a
bit
withdrawn
and
the
malt
sweetness
was
big
almost
could
be
considered
a
dessert
beer
this
would
pair
best
with
sweet
and
savory
dishes
the
beer
pours
a
rich
and
deep
caramelreddish
brown
with
a
tiny
head
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
it
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rich
with
candy
sweet
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
noticeable
the
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
between
bold
and
robust
malt
sweetness
with
flavors
of
molasses
and
twizzlers
noticeable
that
is
very
balanced
with
a
delicate
and
lingering
hop
bitterness
the
hops
taste
earthy
and
grassy
but
are
mostly
just
noticeable
through
the
bitterness
the
mf
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
decent
e
s
a
and
quite
enjoyable
very
nice
attempt
at
the
style
tasty
and
drinkable
im
glad
that
i
have
some
bottles
left
o
it
was
never
gonna
be
stellar
however
this
beer
lost
its
opportunity
to
be
my
gotobeer
with
the
lousy
finish
ill
try
it
again
but
i
suspect
the
bittering
hops
had
a
lot
to
do
with
that
freshcutlawn
taste
gag
clean
and
dry
just
that
damn
overbearing
fruit
overall
this
is
fairly
well
balanced
yards
claims
this
is
their
first
ale
and
it
is
a
good
start
extra
special
ale
came
to
me
looking
real
nice
out
of
the
firkin
the
color
is
a
bold
brown
with
light
golden
hues
towards
the
sides
up
to
the
light
rising
bubbles
with
a
off
white
dense
head
that
stuck
around
smell
is
on
the
malty
side
with
caramel
and
some
faint
pale
malt
this
fresh
version
brings
out
nice
earthy
hoppy
appeal
with
some
citrus
ive
never
had
this
as
fresh
before
and
it
shows
taste
hits
the
spot
refreshing
with
a
mix
of
malt
a
apparent
english
yeast
strain
some
nutty
appeal
and
some
earthy
hops
towards
the
end
it
all
melds
nicely
leaving
me
sipping
more
feel
is
mediumish
with
some
bright
bubbles
felt
on
the
tounge
after
all
the
hubbub
the
aftertaste
is
earthy
and
fresh
and
nice
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
in
this
one
a
beer
i
always
thought
was
sub
par
actually
has
class
it
all
depends
on
the
serving
type
and
freshness
bottles
of
this
would
be
a
no
go
for
me
as
they
degrade
quickly
yards
esa
is
a
philly
classic
one
of
the
beers
that
got
philly
on
the
map
the
beer
pours
medium
amber
topped
with
a
modest
white
head
the
head
diminishes
somewhat
yet
retains
throughout
the
entire
pint
the
aroma
is
perfectly
malty
with
some
bready
toastiness
and
some
caramel
notes
tastes
initially
malty
toasted
caramel
with
some
biscuit
notes
basically
a
classic
bitter
a
must
have
especially
in
philly
it
is
simply
the
beer
that
made
yards
and
tom
kehoe
famous
overall
a
very
good
ale
that
id
undoubtedly
have
again
dark
and
robust
in
flavor
its
definitely
a
beer
that
ill
continue
to
enjoy
throughout
the
holiday
season
the
flavor
begins
quite
malty
with
lots
of
toasted
bread
and
sweet
caramel
but
finishes
with
a
surprising
dose
of
bitterness
hops
are
mostly
of
the
grassy
herbal
variety
and
are
very
much
in
a
traditional
english
style
to
my
palette
this
beer
has
a
particularly
long
and
lingering
aftertaste
with
strong
bitterness
and
herbal
flavors
hanging
around
for
some
time
carbonation
and
body
and
both
moderate
making
this
an
easy
one
to
drink
although
its
a
bit
higher
on
the
abv
scale
than
its
counterparts
booze
is
not
noticed
in
the
nose
or
taste
fresh
bottle
from
super
buy
right
extremely
generous
off
white
head
on
a
golden
body
creamy
yeasty
on
english
hops
great
drinkability
drying
finish
not
the
style
bang
on
but
a
good
englished
up
ale
above
average
mouthfeel
satisfying
and
good
by
itself
or
with
food
very
nice
worth
picking
up
a
decent
beer
from
the
bottle
is
made
much
better
from
the
cask
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
head
smells
malty
and
delicious
a
little
bready
and
sweet
palate
is
sharper
than
expected
with
a
noticeable
hop
presence
sweet
malty
and
earthy
pretty
nice
flavor
profile
overall
mouthfeel
is
mildly
creamy
with
adequate
body
a
solid
brew
from
yards
great
representation
of
an
english
esb
all
ill
say
is
seek
it
out
on
cask
or
hand
pump
always
available
the
abbaye
in
my
hood
its
a
different
experience
from
the
bottled
version
and
the
result
is
much
more
enhanced
i
overlook
this
brew
at
the
abbaye
due
to
excellent
rotating
taps
and
when
i
come
back
to
this
favorite
standby
i
ask
myself
why
the
separation
overall
this
style
of
beer
might
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
feel
as
if
it
still
could
have
been
done
better
im
definitely
not
disappointed
but
due
to
the
b
rating
here
and
the
packaging
of
the
beer
my
hopes
were
kind
of
high
slightly
above
average
beer
but
overall
drinkability
is
outstanding
6
have
a
few
enjoy
the
phils
and
stay
taught
surprisingly
i
dont
see
this
one
available
much
on
tap
or
single
bottles
for
take
out
oh
well
pours
a
slightly
hazed
amber
with
a
goodsized
fluff
of
white
head
that
recedes
a
bit
leaving
some
moderate
lacing
behind
nice
smell
basic
caramel
malts
and
a
good
balance
of
nonthreatening
hops
good
caramel
hops
on
the
tongue
earthy
and
herbal
hops
giving
a
great
mild
bitterness
to
balance
the
malty
sweetness
i
really
like
this
beer
medium
body
and
quite
good
for
a
relaxing
session
overall
a
decent
esb
probably
nothing
i
would
search
out
again
o
overall
its
a
decent
beer
easy
drinking
and
tasty
nothing
amazing
or
unique
simply
a
wellmade
easy
drinking
beer
o
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
esb
i
would
totally
order
this
in
a
bar
i
wish
this
was
distributed
here
in
ca
final
thoughts
a
very
nice
extra
special
the
nose
was
ever
changing
on
me
enjoy
this
one
with
a
nice
english
dinner
worth
the
buy
ovrerall
solid
sexy
looking
and
tastes
great
o
not
a
bad
brew
from
yards
the
lightness
of
this
beer
is
good
to
go
with
bolder
foods
such
as
bbq
this
beer
tends
to
be
right
on
as
far
as
mixing
the
bitterness
and
the
rich
maltiness
the
brew
also
tends
to
be
lighter
on
the
pallet
as
well
the
only
downfall
was
the
fact
that
you
couldnt
get
a
good
aroma
to
sway
the
sweetness
or
bitterness
of
the
beer
i
just
wish
that
there
was
more
to
the
smell
but
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
true
to
style
esb
poured
this
beer
into
my
new
palm
tulip
it
has
little
bit
of
head
which
leaves
a
film
on
the
beer
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
beer
has
a
nice
nutty
mildly
roasty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
is
similar
light
yet
substantial
nutty
and
mildly
roasty
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
as
well
but
it
seems
to
be
mostly
for
balance
which
it
does
very
well
it
has
a
medium
to
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
it
is
a
very
refreshing
well
made
esb
great
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
i
havent
experienced
many
esbs
hopefully
others
are
similar
to
this
one
the
extra
alcohol
doesnt
detract
either
and
can
barely
be
felt
in
this
beer
this
is
about
as
well
balanced
as
an
esb
gets
and
would
be
a
great
choice
for
someone
trying
this
style
for
the
first
time
all
of
the
flavors
may
not
mesh
well
together
but
the
earthy
hops
that
softly
linger
in
the
aftertaste
serve
as
a
reminder
of
what
this
beer
is
i
certainly
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
in
the
near
future
pours
a
deep
redamber
color
with
a
thick
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
without
being
overly
sweet
with
a
combination
of
dried
strawberries
toffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
much
more
balanced
if
not
a
little
hopheavy
with
characteristics
of
pine
and
earth
being
contrasted
by
malty
notes
of
burnt
caramel
toffee
and
some
berry
sweetness
the
beer
has
a
nice
medium
body
that
stands
up
against
the
blend
of
flavors
but
the
fine
prickly
carbonation
at
least
in
this
bottle
detracts
somewhat
overall
though
this
one
is
a
satisfying
hopforward
bitter
that
drinks
like
a
light
barleywine
a
good
example
of
the
e
s
b
style
for
sure
a
more
aggressive
bitter
i
am
really
enjoying
the
less
appreciated
style
quest
though
o
solid
beer
and
my
first
yards
and
es
o
a
great
mixture
of
flavor
and
texture
nice
chewy
grains
and
a
slick
ride
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
brownish
copper
color
that
looks
quite
nice
in
the
glass
the
head
in
pretty
good
too
it
kinda
shrinks
down
to
a
thin
film
that
lays
on
top
of
the
beer
as
you
drink
the
aroma
wasnt
too
bad
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
good
on
the
nose
the
flavor
kinda
disappointed
me
a
bit
i
felt
that
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
wasnt
all
there
i
feel
that
it
was
kind
of
avoided
or
forgotten
to
me
this
just
didnt
taste
much
like
an
esb
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
its
a
medium
body
with
some
light
carbonation
appearance
is
an
amber
tone
with
little
head
its
smell
has
caramel
fruit
grass
and
pleasant
in
general
for
the
taste
i
noted
roasted
malts
some
hops
more
sweetness
mf
is
a
bit
silky
with
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
esb
from
yards
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
was
happy
with
it
this
was
easy
and
flavorful
drinking
here
on
the
cask
especially
for
the
size
and
im
glad
that
i
gave
this
yards
take
on
an
esb
a
shot
i
think
that
i
could
have
put
a
couple
of
these
down
easily
do
not
too
overpowering
to
the
palate
but
does
have
a
decent
aftertaste
decent
alcohol
content
that
doesnt
really
come
over
the
top
very
drinkable
which
pairs
well
with
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
pours
a
nice
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hop
note
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
nice
little
hop
note
and
caramel
medium
body
nice
little
bitterdry
finich
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
a
great
sipper
to
enjoy
while
contemplating
the
days
events
some
time
in
a
cellar
would
round
out
its
rough
edges
d
theres
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
most
of
which
i
find
enjoyable
its
definitely
malty
and
sticky
with
some
moderate
sweetness
theres
also
a
nice
medium
hop
profile
along
with
some
yeasty
esters
it
manages
good
balance
without
necessarily
being
overly
smooth
or
subtle
medium
bodied
with
a
very
good
balance
of
earthy
and
citrus
hops
countered
by
a
sweet
malt
backbone
again
this
beer
is
hoppier
than
anticipated
with
a
nice
blast
of
bitter
earthy
pine
needle
flavor
as
well
as
some
subtle
citrus
rind
flavor
this
is
quickly
countered
by
a
sweet
caramel
malt
presence
with
hints
of
toffee
biscuit
and
hazelnut
d
easily
could
have
several
very
drinkable
classic
tasting
beer
thats
loaded
with
style
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
at
least
on
cask
yards
extra
special
ale
is
the
original
beer
that
yards
made
in
1994
so
it
has
a
special
significance
to
philadelphia
and
the
drinkers
that
call
the
city
of
brotherly
love
home
it
was
one
of
the
instrumental
beers
that
kicked
off
the
craft
beer
movement
here
this
is
a
classic
beer
it
has
a
deep
reddishamber
color
with
a
longlasting
film
of
white
foam
that
sticks
around
the
beer
smells
like
rich
caramelized
malt
with
a
earthy
woody
hop
aroma
there
is
a
hint
of
browned
apple
skins
and
lightly
toasted
bread
the
beer
tastes
malty
with
a
graininess
in
the
front
with
a
slightly
molassess
sweetness
hints
of
apple
cider
bruised
pears
and
then
finishes
a
little
sticky
with
residual
sweetness
and
a
nice
herbal
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
nice
and
soft
and
with
a
mediumfull
body
i
feel
like
there
are
a
few
defects
compared
to
the
bet
esb
examples
first
the
fruit
quality
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
subdued
me
and
tastes
slightly
oxidized
the
beer
is
probably
also
a
little
too
bitter
and
the
bitterness
is
too
harsh
and
lingers
on
your
tongue
too
long
leaving
weird
almost
metallic
aftertaste
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
can
only
imagine
drinking
this
after
having
only
light
american
lagers
to
drink
for
decades
and
then
trying
this
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
ale
balanced
flavors
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
deep
copper
in
color
with
a
dense
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
cap
leaving
some
lacing
this
looks
great
the
nose
has
caramel
toast
light
leafy
hops
as
it
warms
up
some
cocoa
appears
the
palate
opens
moderate
sweet
with
some
caramel
toasted
white
bread
and
light
coffee
a
little
bet
of
mineral
character
seems
to
be
present
as
well
hops
are
present
on
the
finish
lending
a
green
flavor
and
bitterness
medium
in
body
great
finish
with
mild
hops
and
sweetness
this
beer
is
wellbalanced
and
is
quite
enjoyable
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
drinkability
a
good
beer
that
tastes
like
a
hearty
dubbel
a
sipper
for
a
cool
night
maybe
one
or
two
per
session
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
that
looks
thick
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
has
excellent
retention
smells
like
hops
that
seamlessly
blends
with
caramel
smoothness
and
breadiness
tastes
bready
with
caramel
maltness
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
middle
and
hops
bitterness
coming
in
in
the
end
feels
very
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
with
the
taste
lingering
on
the
tongue
long
after
the
beer
is
empty
overall
this
beer
is
on
the
higher
end
of
the
abv
spectrum
for
an
esb
but
at
least
it
leads
to
a
robust
and
fullflavored
beer
for
the
style
worth
a
shot
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
an
off
whore
head
the
nose
is
good
yet
fragile
with
some
light
caramel
and
some
herbal
and
pine
hops
the
taste
brings
some
slight
bitterness
to
a
toasted
body
with
caramel
and
toffee
light
to
medium
body
with
flood
drinkability
only
had
a
chance
to
drink
one
of
these
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
it
is
generously
hopped
and
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
malt
i
would
prefer
a
bit
creamier
of
a
finish
but
it
does
have
a
a
hint
of
a
creamy
taste
i
think
a
good
creamy
finish
makes
an
esb
perfect
the
bear
laces
very
nicely
in
the
glass
has
a
fine
deep
amber
color
i
hope
to
make
to
the
brewery
sometime
while
visiting
philly
if
this
one
is
as
good
and
drinkable
as
it
was
then
im
confident
they
have
some
other
keepers
d
high
abv
makes
this
one
a
good
drinker
but
not
a
session
beer
worth
the
trip
to
yards
and
having
to
share
with
friends
bottle
pours
a
very
deep
reddish
rust
mahagony
color
with
surprisingly
a
very
small
head
of
slight
tan
that
collars
around
the
glass
lots
of
wheat
in
the
nose
but
thats
really
all
i
am
getting
no
real
hops
aroma
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
hop
and
wheat
flavored
after
taste
lingering
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
kind
of
just
ok
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
smooth
going
down
nothing
fancy
but
pretty
drinkable
drinkability
is
nice
alcohol
is
a
touch
high
for
an
esb
and
not
entirely
balanced
nice
malt
character
d
not
a
bad
little
beer
abv
is
pretty
good
a
1
a
session
beer
for
me
worth
looking
up
ill
try
some
of
their
other
stuff
doverall
a
solid
showing
a
good
beer
to
drink
whenever
went
down
smooth
and
easy
and
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
will
definitely
order
again
enjoying
this
beer
with
a
plate
of
bangers
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
head
the
color
of
white
cheddar
sweet
aromas
are
big
on
molasses
and
garden
soil
with
lighter
spicy
notes
coming
through
as
well
taste
of
big
toasted
and
sweet
malts
intermingled
with
hops
that
are
initially
earthy
and
then
linger
like
orange
zest
on
the
finish
very
interesting
hefty
body
is
perfectly
suited
to
a
beer
of
its
flavor
profile
and
taste
amplitude
a
beer
whose
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
into
an
american
pint
glass
poured
amberbrown
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
smelled
of
molasses
honey
and
malt
the
taste
revealed
caramel
apple
maple
syrup
honey
and
maltiness
dissolving
to
a
sweet
finish
creamy
mediumbodied
modestlycarbonated
texture
good
session
beer
couldnt
help
but
wonder
how
this
would
taste
on
cask
one
of
the
most
drinkable
domestic
esbs
ive
come
across
and
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
it
packs
a
little
more
of
everything
that
is
hops
malt
and
alcohol
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
give
this
a
5
on
drinkability
it
starts
to
wear
thin
after
45
pints
but
i
strongly
endorse
nonetheless
poured
dark
amber
maple
syrup
color
with
a
thin
off

spotty

but
quite
clear
nice
biscuity

with
a
pinch
of
roast
and
clean
herbal
hops
maybe
a
slight
citrus
twang
light
bodied
and
slick

a
decent

color
with
spare
off

and
and
spare

lively
fizzy

smell
and

that

slightly
bitter

like

average

duration
great
session
beer
quite
dark
for
an
ale
but
nonetheless
tasty
if
consumed
properly
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
attempt
again
this
is
a
very
good
brew
has
a
very
nice
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
also
looks
good
very
good
drinkability
as
well
would
be
good
any
time
of
year
another
fine
brew
from
yards
this
may
be
my
favorite
one
i
have
tried
from
them
so
far
certainly
not
the
light
drinker
i
was
expecting
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
thanks
vince
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
no
identification
as
to
the
freshness
it
appears
a
somewhat
clear
amber
color
that
has
some
noticeable
small
particles
stuck
in
suspension
keeping
it
from
being
totally
clear
presents
2
fingers
of
slightly
tanned
fluffy
head
with
fair
retension
that
leaves
a
sticky
about
of
lace
clinging
to
the
glassware
in
patches
aroma
is
quite
malty
grainy
and
has
a
little
bit
of
mineral
character
to
it
before
the
hops
come
into
play
taste
is
slightly
bitter
upfront
with
a
nice
malt
presence
and
again
some
mineral
flavors
come
into
play
along
with
the
flavors
of
the
hops
this
beer
leaves
a
lingering
hop
flavor
in
your
mouth
without
having
much
bitterness
hops
are
somewhat
spicy
and
herbal
which
exaggerates
the
mineral
flavor
in
this
beer
light
feel
with
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
overly
exciting
about
this
beer
but
nothing
to
complain
about
either
as
it
warms
the
6
alcohol
starts
to
come
through
a
bit
12
oz

glass
pours
a
rich
opaque
brown
with
1
5
fingers
of
head
not
very
much
in
the
aroma
maybe
a
little
burnt
sugar
the
first
taste
is
toasted
malt
character
the
rest
of
the
sips
i
get
only
bitterness
nothing
too
complex
but
probably
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
poured
a
dark
orange
to
brown
with
beautiful
clarity
nice
head
retention
and
foam
lacings
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
not
very
aromatic
no
hop
aromas
but
experienced
light
coffee
and
caramel
scents
coffee
flavors
up
front
that
taper
to
pleasant
carmel
flavors
and
finish
faint
licorice
undertones
and
the
end
as
well
lazy
carbonation
a
smooth
bodied
feel
in
the
beginning
with
a
mild
hoppy
finish
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
d
nice
tame
drinkable
beer
with
good
taste
makes
a
very
good
session
beer
d
not
bad
but
pretty
mundane
i
wish
the
flavor
matched
the
nice
mouthfeel
with
something
more
interesting
in
either
the
hops
or
the
malt
department
ddespite
my
lower
rating
for
thisi
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
enjoyable
beer
to
meit
seems
to
be
more
of
a
novelty
beer
than
anything
else
but
its
still
something
id
like
to
revisit
its
nice
to
see
yards
beers
around
again
on
my
next
trip
to
pa
or
nj
ill
definitely
be
purchasing
this
esa
again
very
drinkable
my
type
of
stronger
than
normal
session
ale
session
ale
drinkability
from
the
second
you
open
one
of
these
up
it
begs
you
to
drink
it
very
inviting
disposition
both
in
taste
and
smoothness
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
overall
this
ale
is
deserving
of
its
extra
specialness
light
enough
to
session
but
by
no
means
light
nice
big
flavors
medium
body
mixed
fruit
and
bittering
hop
finish
it
aint
bad
but
if
i
was
at
a
bar
and
ordered
a
pint
of
this
id
be
bummed
ooh
that
was
unexpected
modest
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
wellconcocted
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
roasty
earthy
finish
the
aftertaste
is
almost
like
a
coffee
or
espresso
i
really
dont
get
a
lot
of
bitterness
from
it
but
that
may
be
my
mind
playing
tricks
on
me
as
a
result
of
the
lasting
impression
of
the
caramel
and
coffee
flavors
overall
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
moderate
body
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
this
beer
is
a
smooth
drink
with
nice
but
soft
flavors
the
tart
hops
come
through
as
the
beer
warms
but
the
malt
stays
soft
d
extra
special
as
in
esa
sounds
promising
as
if
this
combination
of
words
shouldnt
be
thrown
around
honestly
i
feel
like
they
could
have
left
the
es
out
of
the
name
and
simply
called
it
an
ale
overall
a
pretty
average
brew
maybe
it
doesnt
really
belong
on
cask
as
the
result
seemed
underwhelming
and
contrived
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
ton
better
than
i
remember
it
from
my
previous
sampling
lots
of
flavor
and
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
this
is
an
outstanding
esb
and
i
would
actually
buy
a
case
of
this
which
is
saying
something
because
there
are
very
few
beers
id
want
a
whole
case
of
at
a
time
great
session
beer
worth
seeking
out
a
dark
chestnut
color
slightly
cloudly
with
a
mellow
orange
glow
the
head
is
a
modest
offwhite
cover
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nutty
malt
with
a
pleasant
floral
hops
nice
the
flavor
brings
a
great
paradox
of
bitter
granny
apple
and
orange
blended
with
sweet
caramel
malt
the
bitterness
is
clear
and
prominent
yet
there
is
plenty
of
mellow
grain
medium
bodied
but
a
slight
resinous
feel
quite
right
for
the
style
in
my
book
plenty
drinkable
but
it
has
good
personality
spot
on
for
an
english
esb
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
to
enjoy
i
feel
as
though
i
should
be
in
an
olde
tavern
enjoying
this
thanks
to
edbeer
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
deep
translucent
mahogany
with
a
half
inch
loose
offwhite
head
that
reduced
its
volume
in
seconds
before
settling
into
a
fairly
consistent
skim
some
slashes
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
mild
nose
aromatic
hops
on
a
malt
backbone
taste
was
caramel
malts
interspersed
with
some
bittering
hops
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
with
a
consistent
background
effervescence
not
my
favorite
style
per
se
but
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
esb
well
worth
seeking
out
id
love
to
try
this
one
on
cask
d
manageable
abv
and
tasty
definitely
some
odd
flavors
for
the
style
pretty
dark
lower
hop
profile
lower
than
average
carbonationfor
a
bottled
es
bitter
and
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
deep
for
the
style
even
though
its
not
overly
sweet
it
kind
of
sucks
to
take
points
off
a
tasty
beer
because
its
too
far
out
of
style
a
pretty
good
selection
in
the
class
of
moderately
dark
ales
my
first
in
the
esb
style
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
like
pours
a
copper
brown
color
with
a
nice
slight
off
white
frothy
head
that
is
around
one
finger
in
size
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
a
little
sweet
malt
with
some
floral
hops
taste
has
a
roasted
and
caramel
malt
backbone
which
mid
way
through
gives
way
to
the
bitterness
of
floral
hops
the
hop
bite
is
subtle
and
slightly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
the
taste
isnt
exceptional
but
there
is
also
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
the
beer
and
it
looks
very
nice
moreys
bottom
line
a
pleasent
surprise
very
well
crafted
ale
highly
recommend
for
fans
of
red
ales
this
beer
is
just
as
much
a
red
as
it
is
an
esb
dont
drink
and
review
definitely
a
very
sessionable
brew
despite
the
abv
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
mellow
is
medium
bodied
and
is
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
personally
the
beer
that
made
yards
famous
for
me
a
long
time
ago
i
had
one
of
these
at
oneals
on
south
street
and
was
instantly
hooked
esa
is
a
consistent
beer
in
my
fridge
the
gravity
pour
created
only
thin
wisps
of
head
color
was
a
hazy
amber
kind
of
like
weak
tea
the
nose
was
lightly
malty
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
mild
bitterness
but
mothing
worth
getting
excited
about
personally
i
felt
it
was
the
least
of
the
three
to
include
brawler
and
phl
pa
on
that
particular
cask
night
note
hand
pumped
is
the
way
to
go
on
this
one
but
the
bottles
although
slightly
more
mild
are
still
very
good
in
their
own
right
a
nice
amber
color
not
much
head
to
it
the
aroma
was
very
faint
but
i
picked
up
some
hops
and
something
else
raisinlike
i
couldnt
be
sure
what
it
was
the
beer
a
nice
light
roasted
taste
easy
on
the
mouth
and
easy
to
drink
i
noticed
a
slight
warm
feeling
from
the
alcohol
but
nothing
overwhelming
poured
with
a
light
head
that
didnt
stick
around
with
a
little
aroma
i
really
liked
the
first
sip
on
this
one
the
carbonation
strikes
the
tongue
just
right
that
the
sweet
malts
mix
wonderfully
with
the
hop
bite
the
carbonation
i
have
noticed
on
these
yards
brews
is
a
bit
more
than
expected
but
it
seems
just
right
here
enjoyable
fresh
12oz
bottle
pours
with
a
hazy
amber
body
with
a
large
sticky
off
white
head
like
an
english
mild
should
strong
caramel
malt
aromas
biscuity
with
grassy
hop
character
in
the
background
good
toasty
malt
flavors
with
plenty
of
caramel
somewhat
earthy
with
a
nice
palatable
amount
of
bittering
hops
full
body
and
lowish
carbonation
give
it
a
nice
feel
overall
it
drank
pretty
good
probably
one
of
the
nicer
takes
on
an
esb
to
come
from
the
states
a
cask
version
with
lower
abv
and
a
bit
less
hopping
would
be
phenomenal
very
interesting
and
well
done
for
the
style
coppery
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
light
carbonation
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
of
grassy
hops
and
toasty
malt
with
some
yeast
evident
as
well
taste
is
toasty
and
malty
with
plenty
of
grassy
floral
hops
and
a
firm
bitterness
at
the
end
some
caramel
taste
as
well
fairly
well
balanced
with
a
medium
body
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
not
too
sticky
but
with
a
nice
malty
finish
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
i
just
know
it
is
ten
times
better
on
cask
will
have
to
head
into
philly
sometime
and
get
it
the
way
it
is
meant
to
be
this
is
just
an
all
around
well
made
beer
d
average
drinkability
the
carbonation
and
bite
make
it
a
slower
drink
d
everything
an
esb
should
be
really
fantastic
brew
theres
nothing
exotic
about
this
its
just
a
solid
through
and
through
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
year
round
simple
and
well
executed
can
be
a
wonderful
thing
the
taste
is
of
strong
malt
and
alcohol
with
a
light
hop
finish
goes
down
very
well
and
tastes
great
this
is
yards
first
beer
and
its
a
great
amber
ale
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
had
high
hopes
going
in
but
a
big
letdown
in
the
end
poured
from
the
bottle
right
down
the
center
frothy
head
disappeared
too
quickly
it
did
leave
a
nice
ring
around
the
outside
but
very
little
to
no
lacing
a
nice
coppery
amber
color
that
is
very
clear
with
a
smattering
of
little
bubbles
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
a
complex
mix
of
fruit
highlighted
by
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
souring
or
bitterness
a
smooth
but
thin
feel
with
slightly
sweet
malts
and
a
crisp
bitter
dry
finish
there
is
very
slight
to
no
noticeable
alcohol
even
though
this
is
an
extra
special
an
excellent
american
version
of
a
great
english
style
im
glad
theyre
located
so
close
by
this
is
a
tasty
brew
d
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
makes
a
decent
session
beer
but
i
think
ill
stick
with
their
brawler
for
that
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
easily
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
given
a
choice
i
think
id
pick
a
one
or
two
beers
from
yards
over
this
one
if
i
were
buying
a
case
with
only
one
style
of
beer
in
it
poured
hard
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
this
beer
leaves
a
modest
but
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
grainy
tannic
with
hints
of
grapes
figs
dark
fruit
the
taste
starts
out
with
the
smooth
round
fruit
up
front
accented
by
a
very
slight
hint
of
roasted
malts
that
cuts
through
it
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
firm
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
with
medium
carbonation
that
turns
a
bit
creamy
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
this
beer
could
easily
have
a
few
though
there
are
plenty
of
other
session
beers
id
go
to
before
this
well
worth
trying
though
pours
a
crystal
clear
i
say
it
even
tho
itis
generic
amber
color
with
a
34
white
head
that
afte
a
bit
drops
to
a
14
aroma
is
malt
and
some
spice
taste
is
malt
toast
some
hop
bitterness
dry
on
the
finish
body
and
mouthfeel
is
fine
would
like
to
try
this
in
the
cask
condition
style

15
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
and
slight
sour
the
flavor
is
a
big
slap
of
amber
malt
deliciously
bready
with
bitter
hop
backbone
the
finish
is
thin
and
bitter
good
d
a
safe
moderate
beer
that
strives
to
be
middle
of
the
road
this
beer
has
a
mild
but
pleasant
nose
mostly
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
with
notes
of
raisin
and
grain
it
has
a
terrific
malt
flavor
punctuated
with
some
fruity
notes
plum
which
is
immediately
smacked
down
by
some
wicked
as
in
wicked
good
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
solid
enjoyable
esb
pours
a
hazy
dirty
brown
color
with
an
over
active
light
brown
head
that
left
some
nice
foamy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
rust
minerals
perhaps
some
fig
or
light
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
a
strong
metallicrust
flavor
earthy
must
have
some
hardass
water
in
philly
some
light
honeysuckel
and
brown
sugar
notes
followed
by
a
bittering
hop
flavor
typical
of
an
esb
the
feel
is
fairly
light
with
very
fizzy
carbonation
has
a
very
airy
feel
to
it
the
finish
is
on
the
slightly
bitter
side
of
the
spectrum
the
metallic
flavor
is
probably
a
bit
strong
but
resembles
the
true
english
ales
a
very
solid
offering
worth
a
try
a
little
tough
because
of
the
carbonation
but
a
very
smooth
and
solid
beer
i
had
some
yards
esa
today
hand
pumped
at
standard
tap
it
had
a
solid
finger
plus
head
and
a
clean
red
amber
color
the
first
taste
was
good
but
the
last
was
exceptional
lots
of
malt
beautifully
complements
the
tangy
hops
i
am
definitely
going
back
for
more
d
easy
to
enjoy
anytime
i
like
me
some
hops
d
i
like
this
one
nice
depth
complex
but
easy
drinking
if
i
could
get
this
where
i
lived
i
would
buy
more
d
quite
enjoyable
spices
make
it
a
little
strong
for
multiple
servings
d
i
like
the
taste
and
look
of
this
beer
but
something
just
seems
a
little
out
of
whack
in
the
body
all
of
the
appropriate
flavors
are
there
but
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
seem
to
be
fighting
each
other
dark
amber
colored
ale
with
a
thin
foam
that
is
quickly
gone
sweet
smelling
aroma
and
taste
of
toasted
malt
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
all
around
decent
beerwould
recommend
to
anybody
i
am
eager
to
sample
other
beers
from
this
breweryive
heard
good
things
about
them
pours
a
clouded
amber
that
has
strong
orange
tones
and
a
bit
of
brown
in
the
mix
as
well
nose
is
a
slight
sugary
leaf
flavor
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
staying
power
that
holds
a
mildly
mature
sweet
woody
tone
very
slight
bitter
edge
on
the
end
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
pretty
standard
on
the
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
nothing
wild
or
crazy
but
it
is
fairly
even
and
smooth
would
probably
be
interesting
on
cask
really
disappointed
with
this
one
i
have
had
their
ipa
before
and
i
remember
enjoying
it
but
this
beer
was
a
mess
way
too
carbonated
and
not
balanced
at
all
the
hops
and
carbonation
drown
out
any
malt
character
i
also
got
a
metallic
taste
to
this
one
that
stayed
for
some
time
not
an
enjoyable
beer
medium
body
with
a
light
dry
finish
refreshing
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
final
thought
cool
brew
i
like
everything
that
is
going
on
and
it
gets
higher
grades
for
originality

but
there
is
no
voting
option
for
that
pretty
nice
and
drinkable
beer
but
i
like
others
in
the
style
better
d
nothing
special
but
solid
now
this
is
beer
i
could
buy
again
oh
wait
the
brewery
is
splitting
up
heres
hoping
the
next
incarnation
of
yards
can
make
this
beer
just
as
delicious
nice
looking
almost
bourbon
colored
ale
with
modest
slightly
offwhite
head
all
slightly
obscured
by
condensation
on
my
glass
subtle
smell
that
starts
with
hops
and
as
i
inhale
aroma
turns
to
malt
and
perhaps
slight
alcohol
note
nothing
over
powering
all
pretty
subtle
nice
smooth
taste
dominated
by
the
malt
again
nothing
really
jumps
out
very
smooth
very
drinkable
beer
with
good
mouthfeel
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
ale
however
nothing
dominates
or
emphasizing
any
aspect
of
the
beer
im
guessing
yards
designed
this
ale
to
be
their
standard
gateway
ale
it
seems
as
though
they
were
less
interested
in
making
a
quality
esb
but
instead
were
trying
to
turn
an
esb
into
an
american
amber
ale
the
results
are
good
but
not
by
any
means
spectacular
other
info
as
with
many
yards
brews
ive
had
in
the
past
at
least
one
beer
out
of
every
6er
appears
to
have
some
sort
of
quality
related
problem
i
really
like
the
beers
when
good
but
wont
be
hashing
out
big
bucks
for
this
micro
when
i
can
trust
some
others
which
also
detracts
from
drinkability
overall
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
on
the
way
home
from
work
this
is
a
very
nice
tasting
esb
and
it
has
a
great
drinkable
quality
as
well

is

solid
white

one

with
a

very
mild

is

although
not

that
standard

taste
is

good

saltiness
and
then
some

in

d
highly
balanced
makes
this
esb
easy
to
drink
not
too
high
abv
either
to
have
a
couple
easy
to
understand
why
there
is
so
many
reviews
on
this
one
compared
to
some
of
the
others
d
the
alcohol
is
creeping
upward
with
the
ale
limiting
the
drinkability
the
strange
spicy
body
would
most
likely
cause
me
to
pass
on
a
2nd
pint
pours
a
solid
copper
with
a
thin
head
and
bunches
of
lacing
aroma
is
faint
but
grassy
hops
and
vague
malts
it
is
taste
is
better
grassy
grainy
hops
and
pale
malts
a
bit
yeasty
maybe
solid
bitterness
i
can
imagine
this
being
phenominal
on
cask
the
mouth
is
solid
good
body
and
carbonation
a
very
very
easy
drinker
and
impressive
for
a
style
that
doesnt
get
me
all
that
excited
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
firing
on
all
cylinders
and
has
great
drinkability
it
has
quickly
become
a
year
round
resident
in
my
refrigerator
buy
pour
and
enjoy
also
if
by
chance
you
can
find
this
beer
on
cask
do
yourself
a
favor
and
have
a
pint
cheers
poured
a
cloudy
dark
burnet
amber
almost
brown
in
color
no
real
head
but
there
were
some
visible
chains
of
bubbles
streaming
up
the
sides
no
lace
present
on
the
glass
although
there
was
a
decent
film
left
on
top
for
a
little
while
smell
was
a
little
light
but
what
was
there
was
not
too
bad
breads
and
grains
predominated
as
it
warmed
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
started
to
come
out
as
well
as
some
hints
of
spices
maybe
a
little
cinnamon
overall
not
bad
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
a
bit
slickoily
and
somewhat
watery
and
thin
aside
from
that
which
would
be
more
of
a
mouthfeel
observation
there
is
a
decently
bitter
hoppiness
to
be
found
here
albeit
a
bit
muted
bread
flavors
as
well
come
into
the
fold
and
it
did
leave
a
slightly
lingering
aftertaste
which
was
nice
again
though
the
feel
fell
a
bit
flat
with
no
real
carbonation
and
the
slick
feeling
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
overall
i
could
see
this
as
a
sessionable
brew
though
a
little
flat
for
me
nice
pour
thick
rich
head
and
lots
of
lace
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
very
faint
caramel
and
not
much
else
taste
is
pretty
nice
with
rich
caramel
some
toffee
and
some
hops
its
6
5
abv
which
is
a
bit
high
for
the
style
but
youd
never
know
taste
wise
id
buy
this
every
now
and
then
for
sure
if
i
could
overall
a
good
standard
esb
or
at
least
it
tastes
like
the
other
esbs
like
mas
old
macus
ive
tried
mildly
fruity
malts
with
herbal
hops
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
if
youre
in
a
british
sort
of
mood
this
is
a
good
goto
beer
another
fine
beer
from
pennslyvania
drinks
pretty
easy
a
nice
englishinflunced
esb
this
would
be
easy
to
session
on
if
the
6
3
abv
doesnt
sneak
up
on
you
a
bit
thin
but
a
nice
drinkable
beer
5
00
pint
this
one
is
very
flavorful
and
quite
different
from
the
cask
version
we
visited
the
yards
brewery
the
day
before
i
had
this
and
the
brewer
josh
being
a
huge
fan
of
low
alcohol
english
session
beers
named
the
esa
and
the
jefferson
tavern
ale
as
his
personal
favorites
of
the
fine
yards
pantheon
he
said
that
he
had
tried
producing
real
englishstyle
session
ales
at
3
5
abv
or
so
but
there
just
isnt
a
market
for
them
in
the
us
while
i
sometimes
appreciate
a
hugely
hopped
ipa
its
really
not
the
style
i
favor
so
i
am
with
josh
in
finding
the
esa
really
nice
and
the
jefferson
even
better
despite
its
8
abv
overall
a
good
esb
with
a
nice
abv
very
drinkable
the
abv
distinguishes
it
from
other
versions
overall
man
this
was
good
i
drank
it
in
7
or
8
gulps
this
goes
into
my
top
10
easily
on
tap
at
coles
coppered
orange
with
a
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
subtle
soapy
ekg
hops
and
a
slightly
buttery
toasted
biscuit
scent
predominate
the
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
emerges
right
away
assertive
but
quite
enjoyable
given
the
style
then
soapyleafyearthy
hops
come
in
almost
immediately
followed
by
a
wonderful
biscuity
malt
middle
and
slightly
mineral
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
moderately
prickly
carbonation
and
medium
body
all
around
a
great
beer
experience
that
warranted
a
second
and
third
round
i
ordered
this
expecting
something
enjoyable
but
middleoftheroad
all
the
same
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
real
knockout
extremely
drinkable
perhaps
only
when
fresh
esb
recommended
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
easily
however
theyre
not
my
favorite
i
would
probably
reach
for
something
else
over
this
mostly
because
of
the
bitter
aftertaste
flavor
is
similarly
complex
with
caramel
malts
washed
away
with
a
nice
cascadelike
hoppiness
in
the
finish
mediumheavy
body
with
a
perfectly
complementing
medium
carbonation
drinkable
complex
and
a
lovely
mix
of
aromas
and
flavors
drinkability
what
can
i
say
other
than
i
would
have
this
as
a
steady
sessioner
oh
yeah
this
would
do
well
in
session
and
also
with
novice
beer
drinkers
it
has
everything
in
it
but
is
not
overpowering
i
wish
more
bars
around
here
would
have
it
on
tap
because
i
really
think
it
would
catch
on
with
everyone
medium
bodied
with
a
chewy
creamy
mouthfeel
and
soft
carbonation
very
difficult
for
me
to
finish
due
to
the
unpleasant
bitterness
which
doesnt
happen
too
often
this
reminds
me
of
samual
smiths
organic
ale
not
a
fav
this
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
if
this
had
less
alcohol
it
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
cheers
d
at
6
3
abv
and
with
such
a
strong
burnt
taste
this
might
not
be
the
best
session
beer
but
it
will
certianly
go
along
well
with
strongly
flavored
foods
i
can
see
this
riding
high
with
some
barbecue
or
some
really
spicy
wings
drinkability
wellbalanced
example
of
the
style
a
great
session
beer
light
fruity
scent
i
definatley
detect
malts
but
not
too
much
roasting
going
on
the
most
nocticable
thing
is
a
lingering
bitterness
but
its
well
balanced
i
would
say
i
can
readily
call
this
a
smooth
and
sessionable
brew
this
pours
a
reddish
coppery
color
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
pretty
strong
with
a
bisquity
aroma
and
some
fruitapples
the
taste
has
a
definite
hop
feel
that
mellows
the
maltbut
leaves
a
nice
sweetness
the
mf
is
light
and
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
was
once
down
on
yardsbut
ive
changed
my
mind
good
job
overall
the
yards
esa
is
to
me
a
good
solid
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
for
leisurely
slightly
detached
enjoyment
in
the
end
this
offering
is
certainly
above
average
but
nothing
about
it
really
jumps
out
and
grabs
you
the
taste
follows
through
and
is
nice
and
malty
with
the
perfect
amount
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
not
too
bitter
and
not
too
sweet
the
carbonation
makes
it
feel
wonderful
in
the
mouth
too
the
six
pack
of
this
disappeared
very
quickly
slight
medium
tan
head
settles
over
clear
amber
tinged
reddish
liquid
excellent
classic
esb
nose
biscuitysweet
malt
and
fresh
hoppiness
balanced
to
perfection
the
taste
was
more
hoppy
than
malty
sweet
the
dryness
of
the
hops
really
compliments
the
malt
base
the
complex
flavors
were
all
the
more
complex
on
this
cask
version
finished
long
and
bittersweet
poured
a
murky
reddishcopper
color
with
moderate
yet
oong
lasting
tannish
head
smell
seems
to
be
a
combination
of
malts
caramel
and
hops
with
none
dominating
the
other
good
blend
taste
starts
with
toasty
malt
but
slowly
evolves
into
a
strong
hop
bitterness
finishes
very
hoppy
and
bitter
nice
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
with
a
finger
of
loose
head
which
sticks
around
as
a
ring
all
the
way
through
the
beer
aroma
is
a
little
caramel
a
little
floral
hops
and
unforunately
a
little
soy
sauce
this
is
the
second
esb
ive
tried
where
i
smelled
soy
sauce
so
it
might
be
something
with
me
but
its
definitely
offputting
luckily
the
smell
doesnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
the
taste
is
a
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
buttery
flavor
and
a
fairly
strong
floral
hop
finish
leaving
some
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
the
smell
ruins
this
beer
for
me
but
even
without
it
id
say
its
only
an
average
brew
too
bad
the
wait
is
so
long
because
the
airy
foam
head
has
a
nice
casky
look
to
it
and
heavy
sticky
foam
is
the
rule
not
the
exception
here
aroma
is
fruity
hops
with
a
malty
undercurrent
taste
is
smooth
malt
with
fruity
hops
adding
character
but
not
dissolving
your
tongue
more
casklike
attributes
here
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
is
where
i
had
to
ding
this
one
as
i
want
more
but
just
cant
wait
that
long
when
i
could
finally
get
it
in
the
glass
this
beer
had
a
cloudy
gold
color
the
head
was
just
huge
and
frothy
im
about
12
way
through
a
case
and
they
have
all
been
this
way
so
it
isnt
just
an
isolated
bottle
very
pungent
grapefruitypiney
hops
smell
the
grapefruit
is
the
primary
taste
the
bitterness
gives
it
a
dry
finish
that
puckers
your
cheeks
slightly
above
average
beer
that
is
ok
but
nothing
special
from
reading
other
reviews
it
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
variability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
asked
to
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
hop
bite
a
good
session
beer
the
smell
is
very
good
with
hefty
malt
content
and
great
smoothness
some
of
that
smoothness
is
lost
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
good
flavors
remain
the
taste
adds
caramel
and
a
light
hint
of
nuts
to
the
malt
hop
content
is
mild
and
pleasing
it
pours
a
murky
muddy
color
with
a
rather
large
head
of
foam
definitely
an
enticing
sight
solid
hop
aromas
permeate
the
nostrils
a
bit
fruity
with
some
slight
sweet
maltness
same
goes
for
the
flavors
solid
hop
character
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
overly
so
it
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
the
enjoyment
factor
is
solidly
there
im
sure
its
quite
a
treat
on
cask
pours
out
a
dark
amber
brewski
with
a
2
finger
head
smells
sweet
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
tastes
a
bit
dry
with
bitter
hops
thrown
innot
horrible
but
could
be
rounded
out
a
little
bit
better
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
drinkable
beerbut
i
expected
better
maybe
another
one
of
their
styles
ill
try
a
few
more
yards
i
think
more
subtlety
and
complexity
will
be
shown
on
the
cask
versions
of
this
beer
which
can
be
found
all
over
philly
but
for
some
reason
ive
not
partaked
of
those
yet
overalla
passable
bitter
better
as
it
warms
very
malty
as
it
should
be
nothing
of
the
style
that
leaps
out
and
wows
me
but
a
very
solid
attempt
at
the
style
another
solid
part
of
the
variety
pack
bittering
hops
dominate
the
palate
theres
a
touch
of
dark
caramel
and
fruit
as
well
finish
is
crisp
and
the
bitterness
lingers
not
particularly
bad
but
kinda
boring
a
good
fallback
option
yards
esa
shines
on
draft
and
a
fresh
cask
or
keg
can
can
deliver
a
marvelous
pint
that
draws
you
back
again
and
again
this
dark
ambercopper
ale
reveals
slightlyhazy
orange
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
and
a
creamy
dollop
of
short
but
longlasting
offwhite
froth
atop
bright
grassy
leafy
and
floral
hops
greet
you
in
the
nose
along
with
the
signature
yards
fruit
and
mineral
yeastiness
and
wafts
of
hoplaced
caramelaccented
malt
its
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
medium
body
and
a
delicately
zesty
gently
restrained
carbonation
fruitiness
and
malt
combine
upfront
in
the
flavor
before
it
becomes
a
bit
more
complex
as
the
leafygrassyfloral
hop
flavors
and
a
solid
bitterness
arrive
to
dry
things
out
its
not
overly
complex
but
this
is
not
a
onesided
beer
by
any
means
and
that
leads
to
a
great
drinkability
when
its
on
its
on
and
its
always
worth
the
price
of
admission
to
see
if
youve
found
your
pint
for
the
night
always
delicious
and
sometimes
brilliant
this
is
a
slightly
strong
sessionale
thats
not
to
be
missed
edit
wow
this
beer
received
the
lowest
score
ive
ever
given
ive
only
reviewed
craft
beers
up
to
this
point
time
for
me
to
dig
into
some
macroswill
on
cask
at
several
philly
bars
over
the
past
few
months
standard
tap
mcmenamins
etc
dark
amber
and
slightly
muddy
in
appearance
with
an
unusually
fluffy
head
for
a
cask
brew
the
aromas
are
all
sweet
uk
bready
malts
and
some
nice
uk
hopping
is
in
use
here
as
well
the
taste
is
lovely
with
a
sweet
maltiness
in
the
foreground
and
a
slightly
nutty
hopiness
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
cask
greatness
and
the
drinkability
is
great
as
well
one
of
the
best
nonuk
sessions
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
poured
a
lot
darker
than
i
was
expecting
with
just
enough
of
a
head
to
create
a
halfway
decent
lace
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
after
i
learned
it
was
an
esb
and
not
an
ale
or
amber
i
said
aaah
the
aroma
is
strong
in
yeast
and
slightly
old
blackened
bananas
the
yeast
follows
through
into
the
tongue
of
the
beer
and
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
wood
varnish
flavor
the
hops
are
quite
pleasantly
bitter
and
they
hang
around
the
back
of
the
mouth
well
after
i
was
finished
kind
of
like
sucking
on
orange
peels
unless
one
likes
esb
you
may
be
turned
off
by
the
hop
kick
but
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
tasting
to
introduce
someone
to
a
bitter
without
it
being
too
over
the
top
drinkability
and
overall
a
strong
solid
beer
that
has
a
flavor
that
is
purely
american
but
that
flavor
is
nothing
special
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
other
than
that
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
the
drinkability
is
held
down
by
the
lack
of
a
really
good
taste
my
first
offering
from
yards
and
i
must
say
im
a
bit
dissapointed
i
note
that
this
is
classified
as
a
strong
bitter
and
that
it
is
i
dont
find
it
to
be
in
the
english
style
but
its
worth
a
try
super
heads
tops
a
light
murky
brown
appearance
floral
citrus
hop
on
the
nose
very
inviting
light
initial
sweetness
is
followed
by
a
hoppy
tasty
bitter
flavor
finishes
dry
mouthefeel
is
dominated
by
hops
and
dryness
i
like
both
easy
to
drink
smooth
enough
to
have
another
soft
dry
foam
head
that
seemed
to
dry
up
more
and
more
against
the
glass
sharp
malts
smell
deep
on
flavor
of
spicy
molassas
and
low
sweetness
taste
held
a
medium
malts
flavor
without
too
much
flair
something
of
bitter
oranges
and
citrus
but
not
too
much
touches
of
bitter
earthy
hops
arrive
late
medium
to
heavy
body
a
solid

nothing
too
exciting
bringing
me
back
for
more

gets
out

the
sweet

moderate
british
malt
flavor
through
and
through
a
little
bready
and

on
the
finish
there
are
slight
hints
of
the
phenolic
funkiness
that
is
rampant
in
the
bottles
of

and
tj
ale
that
were
oh
so
bad
carbonation
is
light
and
prickly
and
the
body
is
light
as
well
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
can
image
being
wonderful
if
cask
conditioned
as
i
have
heard
from
schoolteacher
if
somehow
i
can
be
assured
that
the
beer
isnt
going
to
be
one
of
the
woeful
ones
i
have
come
across
several
times
i
would
certainly
get
this
again

exceptional

for
this

a
perfect
summerfall
beer
and
better
from
the
cask
i
missed
the
chance
to
have
this
on
cask
in
philadelphia
so
i
brought
home
a
bottle
of
it
to
try
later
tasting
this
makes
me
wish
i
had
gone
to
the
standard
tap
and
dared
the
hangover
gods
this
is
good
heavily
hazed
brownamber
with
a
big
airy
head
that
fades
slowly
the
aroma
is
heavily
fruity
with
apricots
grapefruits
and
plums
riding
over
the
malt
the
flavor
turns
maltier
with
a
strong
toasty
presence
supported
by
a
mild
bitterness
and
that
great
fruitiness
tasty
beer
interesting
ale
unique
and
drinkable
yeast
flavors
may
be
excessive
for
some
beer
is
good
happy
beering
drinkability
a
classic
quite
satisfying
as
it
is
not
overly
heavy
but
not
thin
in
anyway
if
there
wasnt
another
beer
i
wanted
to
try
id
drink
these
all
evening
long
and
be
content
however
im
usually
inclined
to
switch
things
up
given
the
chance
excellent
as
a
session
beer
though
this
brew
from
yards
starts
out
wonderfully
by
building
expectations
with
a
stellar
appearance
but
tanks
back
into
the
land
of
average
thereafter
pours
a
great
looking
cloudy
amber
colour
with
a
big
creamy
offwhite
head
nice
stickiness
and
great
overall
appearance
smells
of
malt
hop
and
a
bit
of
fruit
sweetness
plum
or
grape
perhaps
the
taste
is
average
at
best
much
like
the
smell
theres
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
in
here
along
with
a
bitter
malt
finish
that
is
on
the
dry
side
again
this
ones
nothing
special
but
its
not
bad
either
theres
nothing
striking
that
would
warrant
my
seeking
this
one
out
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
to
me
thanks
to
beerluvr
for
another
yards
creation
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
14

head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma

it

carbonation
this
is
a
fine
esa
it
is
really
smooth
and
flavorful
first
sip
reveals
mild
carbonation
and
an
thicker
than
average
body
the
flavor
is
slight
hit
of
caramel
and
then
a
rush
of
pineygrassy
hops
not
overwhelming
but
definitely
the
strongest
flavor
i
get
the
hops
leave
a
lingering
bitter
coat
in
my
mouth
and
urge
me
to
quest
for
the
hit
of
sweetness
at
the
front
of
this
beer
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i

a
darkish
amberhued
haze
with
a
huge
creamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
smelled
of
sweet
hay
with
pumpkin
spice
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
an
oddly
pleasant
combination
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
like
molassas
but
not
quite
as
syrupy
it
felt
very
good
on
the
palate
and
allowed
the
flavor
to
coat
the
taste
was
spicy
i
detected
orange
clove
and
some
floral
characteristics
quite
complex
actually
with
a
complimentary
level
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
too
heavy
to
be
a
session
brew
perhaps
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
i
enjoyed
this
one
unfiltered
and
cloudy
color
of
old
pennies
creamy
eggshell
colored
head
that
sticks
around
somewhat
interesting
aroma
that
seems
kind
of
schizophrenic
weird
medium
chewy

sort

fruity

flavors
are
all
over
the
place
very
english
esb
in
character
finishes
with
a
decent
hopleaf
twang
that
tied
this
beer
together
interesting
to
say
the
least
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
this
brew
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
an
old
english
style
ale
with
character
try
it
i
first
had
this
on
the
handpump
at
standard
tap
in
philly
the
handpump
seems
to
make
everything
taste
better
i
originally
gave
it
a
5
for
drinkability
but
have
since
edited
it
to
4
5
after
having
the
beer
on
ordinary
taps
still
a
great
beer
but
the
handpump
gave
it
a
sweetness
and
drinkability
that
made
the
beer
a
little
better
overall
this
was
a
damn
good
esb
if
i
have
ever
had
one
poured
a
dark
cloudy
mixture
of
brown
and
copper
hues
with
an
offwhite
head
that
was
not
overly
large
smelled
wonderful
with
heavenly
notes
of
dried
raisins
mollassas
and
sweet
esters
taste
was
biscuity
with
a
firm
hop
bite
coming
out
towards
the
middle
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
buttery
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
and
smooth
if
i
ever
find
this
on
cask
it
may
be
the
best
bitter

a
rare

you

youd
like
to
go
to

in

where
its
the
cheapest
and
best
beer
on
draught
wellappreciated
a
deep
cloudy
amber
ale
with
a
fluffy
head
that
vanishes
a
little
too
quickly
but
with
nice
traces
of
lace
along
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
decently
hoppy
with
scents
of
fruit
the
taste
was
a
nice
blend
of
fruits
obscured
by
hops
and
finishing
off
with
a
dry
taste
the
hops
were
not
overpowering
but
still
gave
your
taste
buds
a
nice
jolt
a
nice
beer
by
any
means
and
one
that
screams
to
be
enjoyed
by
all
deep
dark
amber
with
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
the
lace
clung
to
the
glass
heavy
all
the
way
down
the
smell
was
slightly
fruity
with
an
earthy
quality
the
taste
was
of
carmel
malt
and
slight
hops
with
a
clean
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
bright
crisp
and
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
esb
style
not
too
sharp
and
extremely
drinkable
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
and
hope
to
find
it
on
tap
soon
appearance
it
pours
murky
brown
with
a
bullwinkle
sized
off
white
head
it
has
a
little
bit
of
tingle
on
the
roof
of
your
mouth
it
starts
out
wanting
to
be
hoppy
but
finishes
crisp
it
went
very
well
w
the
lamb
stew
id
made
this
is
a
nice
esb
a
traditional
english
ale
with
complexity
and
flavor
that
really
stands
out
from
the
crowd
one
of
the
best
versions
of
an
esb
made
in
the
us
i
think
i
cant
begin
to
imagine
how
good
this
beer
would
be
when
served
cask
conditioned
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
creamy
head
a
heavy
yeast
aroma
is
predominant
and
hints
at
improper
storage
before
purchase
the
brew
is
overly
hoppy
with
a
harsh
mouthfeel
and
minimum
malt
presence
a
floral
hop
spice
starts
to
work
it
way
though
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
an
old
bottle
that
has
been
stored
at
a
tohigh
temperature
the
whole
brew
hints
at
a
great
beer
but
the
flaws
of
this
bottle
eclipse
the
goodness
reddish

hazy
the
yeast

i
reviewed
this
in
the
bottle
and
finally
tried
this
out
of
the
machinevery
very
nice
poured
a
amber
color
with
nice
medium
sticky
head
the
aroma
was
nice
and
fruity
with
a
chocolate
background
the
taste
shines
in
this
form
very
sweet
and
chocolaty
up
front
with
that
fruitiness
in
the
rear
and
the
hop
dryeness
in
the
wonderful
finish
a
definent
malt
based
beer
just
10
times
better
on
cask
a
great
experience
for
a
beer
geek
the
yards
beers
are
likely
better
served
on
cask
but
this
esa
is
a
fairly
good
taste
even
within
the
bottle
and
may
well
be
my
favorite
beer
out
of
the
variety
case
ive
had
this
from
the
bottle
and
its
much
much
better
on
cask
huge
thick
frothy
head
retains
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
pint
floral
hop
nose
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
a
well
balanced
brew
on
cask
its
that
way
in
the
bottle
as
well
but
so
much
more
flavorful
this
way
fruity
malty
start
gives
way
to
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
finish
this
one
rates
high
on
drinkability
the
pint
i
had
was
gone
much
quicker
than
usual
definitely
recommended
especially
on
tap
or
on
cask
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
the
term
esa
is
a
bit
confusing
to
me
im
assuming
they
just
dont
want
to
use
the
word
bitter
the
aroma
is
malty
with
little
hops
at
all
there
is
bitterness
from
the
hops
in
the
taste
but
i
would
have
like
to
have
a
little
more
hop
flavor
and
aroma
rather
than
just
the
bitterness
appears
amber
ruby
brown
with
a
vibrant
fluffy
copper
white
head
and
i
must
note
the
marathon
head
retention
leaves
a
nice
trickled
lace
aroma
is
a
full
bouquet
of
pine
cone
scented
hops
along
with
tones
of
caramel
malt
underneath
the
hops
taste
is
predominantly
hops
of
earthy
pine
cone
variety
with
a
trace
of
buttery
caramel
malt
to
complement
the
bitterness
a
little
off
balanced
just
way
too
much
hop
bitterness
in
my
book
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
fluffy
textured
with
hop
resins
creating
a
slightly
oily
texture
in
each
sip
the
drinkability
is
kicked
down
a
notch
due
to
the
fact
that
the
hops
a
tad
overbearing
but
overall
this
beer
should
be
experienced
this
one
has
little
head
and
had
a
lot
of
chunky
setiment
on
the
bottom
for
this
reason
i
think
it
may
have
turned
flavor
wasnt
horrible
though
tasted
much
like
an
english
esb
and
works
well
within
that
style
which
really
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
anyways
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
one
that
i
will
try
again
this
is
a
good
brew
the
head
is
quite
creamy
and
full
the
nose
is
a
complex
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
quite
unique
definitely
extra
special
i
think
this
is
probably
my
favorite
esb
i
have
ever
had
although
it
is
called
esa
definitely
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
hops
are
present
and
quite
dominant
but
there
is
still
a
strong
malt
backround
to
balance
the
bitterness
this
gem
is
bottleconditioned
and
that
brings
in
some
other
tastes
that
are
not
common
to
esbs
but
adds
a
nice
touch
the
beer
is
definately
worth
seeking
out
very
britishold
ale
style
in
charactor
tho
hoppier
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
find
yourself
in
its
limited
distribution
range
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
dark
straw
color
that
had
hues
of
amber
the
head
was
creamy
and
beige
in
color
fairly
thick
as
well
there
was
lace
present
as
well
the
aroma
was
semi
sweet
malt
dark
caramel
citrus
and
floral
hops
sugar
coated
almonds
bread
and
yeast
the
flavors
that
hit
my
tongue
were
of
dandelions
hops
fruit
roasted
nuts
and
semisweet
dark
malt
it
had
a
semidry
finish
and
a
hoppy
after
taste
not
strong
but
present
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
absolutely
drinkable
taste
was
bready
doughy
with
a
hearty
yeast
flavor
tossed
in
the
tea
characteristic
found
its
way
into
the
flavor
as
well
also
present
was
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
and
some
biscuit
the
beer
starts
bitter
then
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
ends
bitter
and
dry
with
the
herbal
hops
coming
forth
once
more
i
thought
the
beer
was
just
a
bit
sharp
overall
and
could
have
used
a
bit
more
roundness
i
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
solid
as
a
rock
like
the
city
in
which
it
is
brewed
the
flavor
is
a
tad
thin
but
i
cant
complain
because
there
is
are
a
few
good
things
going
on
the
hops
are
nice
and
spicy
that
could
have
used
a
little
more
help
from
the
carbonation
to
make
this
brew
even
more
crisp
i
did
not
find
this
beer
to
be
really
bitter
maybe
the
malts
balanced
out
the
bitter
flavors
but
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
as
you
get
right
down
to
the
end
of
a
swallow
then
the
bitterness
comes
in
it
adds
some
needed
complexity
to
the
brew
i
was
also
picking
up
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
of
this
one
i
dont
know
the
abv
but
i
would
hope
it
is
pretty
high
since
the
alcohol
comes
through
thanks
to
frank4sail
for
the

fine

this
one

all
of
the
good

esb
should
have

it
is

there
more

that
a
lot
of
esbs
and
i
appreciated
that
fresh
clean

yes
an

no
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
certainly
nothing
to
complain
about
however
its
not
topshelf
dont
pass
on
one
if
its
offered
but
dont
go
too
far
out
of
your
way
to
buy
it
i
was
going
to
present
a
very
detailed
review
but
i
decided
just
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
any
beer
lover
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
real
ale
which
is
saying
a
lot
real
ale
is
an
accomplished
brewery
with
some
great
offerings
i
would
put
this
in
their
top

dry
and
hoppy
as
heck
that
was
unexpected
o
not
a
huge
fan
the
smell
and
taste
are
very
different
that
and
its
inconsistent
with
the
style
better
with
food
d
o
this
beer
has
an
amazingly
complex
aroma
and
lots
of
good
elements
but
the
flavors
arent
as
complex
and
somehow
it
doesnt
quite
hit
it
out
of
the
park
for
me
still
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
this
is
an
updated
review
from
a
long
time
ago
since
then
i
have
reviewed
many
more
beers
and
come
to
appreciate
the
esb
style
far
more
i
think
my
updated
numbers
reflect
a
better
estimation
of
this
beer
i
also
have
come
to
appreciate
the
skill
and
care
that
rabc
puts
into
their
beers
and
the
delicious
consistency
inherent
in
their
regular
offerings
great
job
rabc
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
does
not
measure
up
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
ounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
good
enough
that
ill
need
to
try
this
again
next
winter
season
when
it
returns
i
like
it
enjoyed
it
immensely
on
an
unexpectedly
chilly
spring
night
o
not
the
most
unique
esb
out
there
but
it
does
what
its
supposed
to
and
delivers
without
being
overly
bitterwhich
is
what
i
was
originally
thinking
real
ale
does
a
good
job
at
providing
consistency
they
have
never
amazed
me
but
i
can
always
count
on
them
to
always
be
good
at
providing
something
decent
that
doesnt
completely
break
the
bank
will
drink
again
color
is
copperish
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
more
i
drink
from
real
ale
company
the
more
i
am
impressed
they
really
know
what
they
are
doing
there
in
blanco
texas
definitely
a
peculiar
brew
and
its
one
for
the
adventure
seekers
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
pinkies
in
san
angelo
rjt
the
taste
also
had
a
lot
of
sugary
raisincharacter
to
it
with
hop
balance
taking
over
the
finish
my
only
problem
with
this
is
that
the
hops
taste
dry
they
give
a
dry
character
to
an
otherwise
sweet
beer
i
like
the
bitter
character
it
just
brings
a
little
more
dryness
than
i
want
i
really
like
the
idea
though
of
making
an
esb
thats
thick
and
sugary
i
guess
thats
what
makes
it
double
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
doubly
bitter
instead
and
it
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
other
esbs
ive
had
but
not
by
a
whole
lot
overall
it
really
comes
off
like
an
alt
well
balanced
exceptional
drinkability
its
got
something
of
the
imported
englishy
character
but
i
would
expect
a
fresherdomestically
produced
beer
to
taste
well
fresher
its
certainly
a
good
beer
and
i
hate
to
knock
it
but
it
seems
like
from
my
perspective
they
are
attempting
to
mimic
the
spent
three
months
in
an
unrefrigerated
cargo
container
flavor
common
to
most
import
beers
im
sure
it
comes
down
to
customer
expectations
that
being
said
its
very
reasonably
priced
pretty
darn
good
and
ill
certainly
pick
it
up
again
big
toasted
malt
on
first
taste
some
dark
fruits
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
a
bit
dry
too
this
is
certainly
not
what
i
would
call
a
refreshing
beer
a
bit
too
dry
and
biscuity
i
can
see
this
being
a
one
and
done
winter
warmer
type
of
beer
but
not
recommended
for
a
hot
day
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
a
nice
enough
brew
it
really
is
like
an
esb
turned
up
a
notch
though
that
doesnt
automatically
make
it
any
better
than
good
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
as
a
double
esb
but
what
the
hell
do
i
know
this
was
a
bit
of
a
tossup
between
a
3
5
and
a
4
0
overall
as
this
beer
seems
to
have
some
decent
flavor
and
aroma
i
would
imagine
drinking
this
beer
again
and
again
would
warrant
the
slightly
higher
overall
score
depending
on
freshness
and
serving
origin
it
also
hides
its
alcohol
content
nicely
a
good
malty
bitter
beer
id
definitely
go
for
some
more
this
one
had
some
off
flavors
really
didnt
enjoy
it
much
a
below
average
beer
in
just
an
average
style
a
hybrid
style
beer
from
the
real
ale
folks
in
texas
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orangecopper
color
from
the
12
oz
bottle
smelled
like
an
esb
with
clear
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
greeting
the
sense
first
english
hops
lend
that
british
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
earth
rather
than
the
dank
pine
or
citrus
from
the
west
coast
varietals
i
dont
detect
the
over
7
abv
on
this
ale
a
touch
watery
if
anything
finishes
with
lingering
bitterness
a
plus
in
my
book
the
phoenixx
is
labeled
a
seasonal
release
but
my
bottle
claims
to
be
good
until
september
of
this
year
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
creamy
no
bitterness
but
a
mild
hoppiness
on
the
midpalate
there
is
a
mild
oxidation
on
the
finish
a
little
papery
interesting
but
ive
had
better
esb
and
dont
think
this
is
a
repeat
overall
i
wasnt
wowed
but
i
certainly
drink
another
o
i
have
always
supported
this
beer
cause
i
am
partial
to
esbs
and
to
beers
made
in
texas
i
have
found
that
if
i
was
going
to
buy
any
real
ale
beer
for
myself
it
would
be
this
one
firemans
four
is
over
rated
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
light
fruity
hops
the
flavor
is
smooth
spicy
and
light
naturally
fruity
flavors
earthy
toasted
malts
slightly
hot
a
great
example
of
an
english
strong
ale
i
have
been
getting
some
brews
in
trades
from
real
ale
and
i
have
been
pleasantly
surprised
o
a
semibig
malty
brew
pretty
much
all
malt
no
real
noticeable
hops
toast
and
caramel
more
or
less
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
o
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
wont
say
that
it
is
an
amazing
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
worthy
o
this
beer
seems
to
fall
in
a
weird
spot
there
are
moments
that
you
feel
like
youre
drinking
a
bock
for
the
body
darkness
and
alcohol
but
the
taste
is
def
a
reference
to
a
bitter
its
worth
giving
a
try
but
probably
not
a
daily
drinker
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
below
average
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
one
the
flavors
just
didnt
come
together
that
well
for
me
and
the
malty
base
just
seemed
a
little
overpowering
and
one
dimensional
decent
beer
overall
the
extra
x
means
this
stuff
means
business
it
pours
a
hazy
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
and
grass
that
is
all
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
burnt
grass
musty
wheat
and
a
kinda
meek
snap
of
orangepeel
bitterness
ask
mlady
sitting
next
to
me
while
drinking
this
my
face
went
negative
pretty
quickly
after
this
stuff
was
put
on
my
tongue
now
i
dont
wanna
exaggerate
it
wasnt
godawful
just
unpleasant
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somehow
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
i
did
not
have
a
good
experience
with
this
beer
the
flavors
seemed
rather
sideways
and
everything
was
just
too
i
guess
big
would
be
the
word
here
o
well
ill
give
this
one
points
for
originality
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
unfortunately
it
kinda
ends
up
tasting
like
a
watereddown
porter
overall
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
like
it
but
when
you
say
double
bitter
i
expect
bitter
not
an
ipa
o
soild
esb
would
drink
another
o
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
one
nothing
bad
about
it
but
for
a
7
2
abv
esb
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
pours
a
warm
ruddy
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
recessed
smell
is
of
dark
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
taste
starts
with
smooth
dark
malts
then
in
the
second
half
if
the
taste
i
get
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
this
i
an
interesting
take
on
the
esb
but
i
am
not
sure
if
inwill
revisit
it
again
overall
interesting
take
on
an
esb
the
flavors
are
overwhelming
in
a
negative
sort
of
way
too
bitter
of
a
finish
and
the
malts
are
too
burnt
tasting
i
get
that
its
a
double
esb
i
just
dont
love
how
it
comes
together
o
although
this
is
not
a
style
a
usually
like
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
buy
and
drink
this
again
often
if
it
was
available
here
in
ca
o
ok
but
the
astringency
and
firm
bitterness
are
distracting
and
its
kind
of
a
chore
to
drink
this
beer
when
it
gets
warm
the
cpj
d
malty
flavor
and
overall
balanced
but
leaning
more
towards
the
malts
than
hops
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
being
a
fan
of
esbs
i
didnt
have
much
to
compare
this
with
this
is
an
amped
up
esb
to
be
sure
and
i
wouldnt
call
it
terribly
drinkable
for
the
style
but
it
more
complex
than
most
so
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
notes
phoenixx
is
a
stellar
beer
of
this
style
very
wellbalanced
and
fullbodied
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
i
could
almost
mistake
this
beer
for
a
session
brew
despite
its
abv
a
rocksolid

one
that
i
wish
i
had

are

not

if
such
a

exists

a

i

wouldnt

again
i
am
going
to
have
to
try
another
one
i
think
this
was
somehow
a
bad
batch
i
like
real
ale
products
but
this
was
just
sub
par
for
them
highly
recommend
this
beer
im
glad
i
listened
to
the
clerk
at
wheatsville
coop
in
austin
where
i
bought
this
beer
his
recommendation
was
spot
on
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
probably
drink
again
i
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
but
i
might
pick
up
another
single
before
they
stop
selling
them
for
the
year
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
sure
i
would
consider
it
a
double
esb
nothing
seemed
amped
up
to
me
to
warrant
that
label
but
it
was
a
good
refreshing
drink
taste
is
similarly
hoppy
and
i
found
just
a
little
watery
grain
in
the
finish
phoenixx
is
mediumbodied
wellcarbonated
and
dries
the
mouth
in
its
bitterness
im
left
a
little
disappointed
not
because
the
beer
was
awful
but
because
i
wanted
more
caramelmalt
goodness
from
this
esb
and
less
of
an
american
pale
ale
overall
i
loved
this
beer
and
i
think
real
ale
is
putting
out
some
solid
brews
here
in
tx
malts
come
out
to
play
more
in
the
flavor
plenty
sweet
and
somewhat
toasty
still
a
hopforward
beer
though
grassy
and
citric
as
lime
peel
and
wheatgrass
juice
come
to
mind
there
are
some
chalky
mineral
flavors
as
well
as
a
light
fruitiness
that
give
it
a
bit
of
british
feel
to
it
but
the
hops
seem
to
be
copiously
added
in
true
american
spirit
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
is
particularly
bold
resinous
and
longlasting
a
bit
overthetop
compared
to
most
esbs
but
i
guess
that
what
they
were
aiming
for
with
the
double
i
prefer
mine
more
on
the
sessionable
side
still
a
fun
beer
to
try
though
md
kind
of
thin
and
watery
it
is
unlike
any
other
esb
ive
had
where
i
got
more
of
a
fruity
flavor
a
rare
miss
from
real
ale
d
another
pretty
impressive
beer
from
real
ale
felt
that
it
needed
half
a
point
bonus
for
great
complexity
and
balance
something
a
lot
of
esbs
struggle
with
quite
enjoyable
d
extremely
drinkable
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
this
could
replace
their
rye
pale
ale
or
the
coffee
porter
as
my
favorite
beer
overall
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
an
aged
big
hoppy
monster
just
that
super
sweet
and
dripping
caramel
flavor
malt
that
balances
it
so
well
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
any
day
dvery
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
was
suprized
and
expecting
something
dissapointing
but
got
a
wonderful
beer
d
overall
this
beer
underwhelmed
me
d
well
i
finished
the
pint
fairly
quickly
and
enjoyed
it
but
i
was
ready
to
try
something
else
the
alcohol
feels
and
tastes
stronger
than
it
really
is
my
palate
was
pretty
skewed
which
is
something
to
keep
in
mind
if
this
is
not
your
last
drink
of
the
night
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
would
say
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
but
i
would
rather
have
something
with
a
little
more
oomph
excellent
beer
from
real
ale
too
bad
its
a
limited
released
this
supplants
their
rye
as
a
favorite
bottled
offering
for
me
d
a
very
well
done
brew
and
quite
drinkable

an

for
an

in

with
some

aroma
and
taste
are
very
similar
mild
chocolate
notes
with
raisins
and
faint
toffee
worsens
as
it
warms
and
becomes
borderline
unpleasant
average
mouthfeel
nothing
special
or
standout
lacking
compared
to
other
fine
examples
what
do
you
expect
from
a
mediocre
texas
brewery
trying
to
brew
a
european
classic
good
beer
overall
nothing
to
seek
out
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
so
i
was
excited
to
finally
find
it
at
the
central
market
in
ft
worth
pours
with
a
dark
amberish
color
almost
brown
the
head
was
fizzy
very
light
and
it
dissipated
quickly
faster
than
i
expected
anyways
it
smells
nice
a
good
blend
of
the
hops
and
malts
nothing
too
fancy
at
first
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
i
had
a
few
the
other
night
and
didnt
appreciate
the
taste
but
after
giving
it
a
second
chance
and
writing
this
review
it
has
grown
on
me
ive
always
loved
supporting
real
ale
and
ive
enjoyed
both
of
their
seasonal
beers
so
far
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
is
next
i
cant
wait
for
next
years
pours
a
copperish
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
hops
with
some
toffee
and
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
earthy
hops
along
with
caramel
malt
and
toffee
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
another
good
seasonal
beer
from
real
ale
that
was
recently
released
in
bottles
for
the
first
time
mfd
certainly
a
session
brew
phoenixx
comes
up
a
bit
short
on
body
for
me
overall
a
decent
beer
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
some
esbs
ive
had
good
effort
but
unfortunately
it
falls
short
oh
well
at
least
the
packaging
is
kick
ass
as
for
the
taste
the
hops
were
ripetasting
and
juicy
almost
as
if
this
were
a
fresh
hop
beer
nice
balance
of
toasted
caramel
and
toffee
malts
with
fruity
yeast
esters
and
a
hint
of
that
medicinalesb
twang
that
added
some
pep
to
the
finish
the
medium
body
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
quite
smooth
given
the
style
making
for
an
easy
drinking
esb
real
ale
is
churning
out
some
excellent
beer
these
days
and
the
seasonal
offerings
real
heavy
lost
gold
ipa
and
now
dbl
phoenixx
are
all
worth
seeking
out
d
happily
this
is
produced
locally
sadly
it
is
not
bottled
and
a
seasonal
effort
at
that
i
like
this
beer
there
are
better
in
the
style
to
be
sure
but
still
a
strong
effort
decently
balanced
big
esb
give
it
a
try
pours
a
medium
brown
colored
body
clearish
with
a
big
creamy
offwhite
head
hoppy
grapefruity
aroma
very
bitter
and
dry
smelling
creamy
hoppy
bitter
dry
taste
some
strawberry
maltiness
too
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
for
some
more
flavor
some
more
flavor
not
too
bad
much
more
flavor
no
aftertaste
it
just
fades
a
very
good
esb
in
my
opinion
and
something
id
order
several
pints
of
in
an
evening
overall
exactly
as
advertised
an
esb
with
more
malt
and
hops
but
still
within
the
style
real
ale
youve
made
another
excellent
beer
on
tap
at
the
draught
house
pours
a
dark
maroon
color
with
a
medium
beige
lasting
head
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
fruity
hoppy
gummy
with
big
hop
presence
for
the
style
not
what
i
expected
from
something
called
an
esb
or
labeled
as
an
esa
either
way
extremely
drinkable
fruity
and
hoppy
but
smooth
with
alcohol
hidden
well
very
nice
beer
i
went
to
the
brewery
and
tried
all
the
beers
this
one
stuck
out
the
most
from
my
trip
it
had
a
wonderful
hop
infused
taste
it
wasnt
hoppy
enough
to
blow
my
socks
off
but
the
blend
of
hops
and
amber
malts
was
great
the
aroma
had
a
hop
and
carmel
smell
overall
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
the
phoenix
again
or
order
it
at
a
pub
i
even
bought
a
tshirt
of
the
beer
after
the
tour
not
impressed
at
the
start
but
it
improved
considerably
as
the
temperature
increased
nice
balance
would
drink
again
pours
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
sticky
lace
nose
is
dominated
by
fresh
grassy
hops
along
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
nuttiness
taste
begins
with
some
toasted
malts
but
the
hops
are
the
key
players
however
the
hops
present
themselves
in
a
very
earthy
mannermore
so
than
in
just
about
any
beer
i
can
remember
trying
this
beer
definitely
improves
as
it
warmsin
fact
near
roomtemperature
is
ideal
one
youd
repeat
in
the
same
night
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
in
fort
worth
poured
a
murky
brown
into
a
22
oz
glass
with
a
tenacious
1
5
finger
head
the
aroma
was
mainly
of
the
hops
with
some
undertones
of
hazelnut
and
caramel
taste
was
nice
and
bitter
heavy
on
the
hops
with
a
malty
toffeelike
sweetness
balancing
the
bitter
floral
hops
there
was
some
hint
of
a
roastednut
twinge
to
it
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
phenolic
with
a
little
bit
of
bite
from
the
alcohol
drinkability
was
average
meaning
that
it
was
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
another
round
mouthfeel
is
medium
clean
with
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
good
if
you
like
this
style
but
too
dry
to
really
session
and
strays
far
from
a
traditional
esb
drinkability
labeled
as
a
double
esb
whatever
that
may
mean

i
had
a
review
it
was
pretty
good
somehow
it
did
not
upload
despite
hitting
review
the
beer
is
amber
and
has
a
white
head
smells
mildly
of
malt
tastes
about
the
same
with
a
nutty
quality
to

nice

one
of
the
better
ones
from
full

comparable
in
quality
to
the
amber
i
think
funny
i
find
myself
thinking
this
is
just
short
of
great
but
only
because
its
so
solid
in
appeal
nothing
sharpish
or
spiky
solid
is
what
im
left
with
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
good

more
novice
beer
nut
or
a
good
one
for
large
gettogethers
this
pours
out
a
clear
walnut
amber
color
with
a
small
very
white
head
the
nose
offers
a
moderate
malt
scent
a
little
grainy
with
a
faint
hop
presence
and
though
faint
in
aroma
bitterness
comes
through
well
to
taste
providing
a
good
offset
to
the
strong
malt
flavor
its
too
bad
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
lacking
this
feels
more
like
a
generic
amber
american
ale
than
an
esb
its
drinkable
enough
but
not
worth
a
special
release
this
is
a
typical
example
of
the
style
with
a
good
grain
profile
it
simply
does
not
set
itself
apart
from
say
a
fullers
esb
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
i
will
have
to
get
another
six
pack
of
this
for
the
weekend

it

wow
full

what
went
wrong
here
i
am
a
fan
of
your
amber

or
something
is
not
right
with
the
yeast

i
was
hoping
for
an
english

overall
id
say
a
solid
710
for
the
most
part
i
feel
full
sail
offers
a
good
quality
for
a
good
price
this
beer
is
just
that
it
follows
the
style
is
a
good
beer
but
i
prefer
to
drink
esbs
in
either
early
spring
or
autumn
i
think
for
the
rest
of
the
public
this
beers
idea
to
offer
for
the
summer
months
may
not
be
as
profitable
as
possible
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on

of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
grain
and
nutty
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
smells
slightly
better
than
it
tastes
o
a
great
esb
that
is
paired
nicely
with
the
hops
the
sweet
toffee
and
carmel
balance
the
orange
citrus
bite
of
the
hops
pretty
big
for
and
esb
but
coming
from
and
american
brewer
it
is
nothing
new
balance
is
this
beers
most
noticeable
trait
and
it
works
from
start
to
end
solid
beer

nothing
to
write

wish
id
bought
a
case
id
love
to
see
this
in

someday
medium
bodied

much
more
flavorful
and
interesting
that
the
aroma
suggests
surprisingly
hop

a
nice
dry
bitterness
that
counters
the
strong
malt
sweetness
resinous
with

flavor
along
with

character
this
is
countered
midpalate
by
sweet

hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
as
in
the
nose
the
fruit
notes
become
more
apparent
in

the
taste
was
not
quite
what
i
wanted
its
more
bitter
than
id
like
for
an
esb
i
prefer
more
balance
the
variety
of
hops
is
not
one
im
particularly
fond
of
either
however
given
some
breathing
time
i
got
a
bit
more
malt
flavour
out
of
it
it
went
well
with
pork
so
it
wasnt
at
all
a
bad
experience
i
just
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
it
either
its
just
got
that
typical
american
craft
hoppiness
to
it
that
annoys
me
very
good
session
beer
very
approachable
and
good
to
meet
the
range
of
a
broad
beer
audience
it
went
over
well
and
now
there
are
a
few
more
people
who
declare
themselves
interested
in
esbs
my
job
as
a
ba
was
done
taste
shows
none
of
the
astringency
i
was
smelling
just
a
nice
toasty
breadbiscuit
malt
with
a
nice
sidecar
of
hop
flavor
finishes
balanced
and
mild
mouthfeel
might
be
the
best
part
of
this
beer
full
sail
nailed
it
its
fullbodied
but
not
sweet
and
has
a
awesome
creamy
mouthfeel
i
really
like
this
one
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
the
esb
category
and
also
one
of
the
better
full
sail
offerings
i
have
had
good
price
as
well
ill
have
another
please
sir
overall
this
is
a
very
good
esb
from
an
american
brewery
it
doesnt
stray
too
far
from
the
style
guidelens
while
still
throwing
its
own
twist
into
the
mix
it
also
donates
some
proceeds
to
charity
check
it
out
if
you
see
it
it
really
is
quite
good
overall
not
bad
better
than
a
lot
of
other
esb
beers
decent
copper
reddish
malts
toffee
and
caramel
and
decent
earthy
hops
fairly
drinkable
with
interesting
hop
characteristics
that
get
a

interesting

weird
and
a
bit
bitter
o
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
beer
will
pick
this
up
again

with
surprising
faint

and
belgian
spices
flavor
also
full
bready
and
biscuity
malt
with
slightly
citrus
hops
and
light
fruit
finishes
with
malt
a
nice
hop
kick
and
a
bit
of
drying
citrus
nice
mellow
flavor
progression
and
finish
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
on
a
esb
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
malty
some
bread
and
caramel
malts
with
a
little
hop
presence
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
the
taste
is
of
bread
and
caramel
malts
a
little
citrus
some
more
bitterness
on
the
way
down
light
bitterness
though
overall
this
is
a
very
easygoing
exceptionally
wellbalanced
e
s
b
it
is
the
strongest
offering
i
have
tasted
from
full
sail
so
far
some
toffee
and
caramel
malt
flavors
definitely
not
a
flavor
bomb
type
of
beer
should
be
very
pleasing
to
old
timers
who
like
tradition
and
mild
flavors
o
this
is
my
first
full
sail
brew
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
like
the
ideas
of
singlehop
beers
for
educational
purposes
and
the
label
indicated
challenger
uk
hops
with
5
malts
worth
a
try
strong
aroma
is
malty
with
fruity
earthy
and
woody
notes
it
pours
a
clear
coppery
with
a
pale
yellowtan
head
of
about
average
thickness
and
persistence
flavor
has
a
woody
core
with
a
fairly
but
not
fiercely
bitter
overtone
and
hints
of
caramel
grass
and
horehound
smooth
firm
texture
is
quite
fizzy
and
lively
this
initial
pub
offering
is
worth
an
investment
o
well
executed
nice
to
see
an
esb
as
a
special
edition
overall
its
just
a
nice
balanced
tasty
beer
sometimes
its
a
long
wearying
road
to
finish
off
a
bomber
but
not
the
case
here
as
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
o
a
lovely
pint
at
the
pub
a
bit
heavy
to
be
a
session
beer
but
a
very
approachable
easy
drinking
esb
a
wonderfully
consistent
producer
nice
blend
of
bitter
and
sweet
very
tasty
and
easydrinking
good
beer
but
this
is
something
i
would
prefer
in
a
6
pack
rather
than
a
bomber
size
something
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
session
worthy
without
the
session
availability
unfortunately
overall
a
good
wellrounded
beer
not
a
bad
e
s
b
at
all
this
beer
is
solid
and
is
something
i
will
certainly
be
buying
more
of
while
i
can
i
would
recommend
you
do
the
same
solid
balance
flavor
and
sweetness
and
doesnt
contain
full
sails
flagship
yeast
character
that
so
many
of
their
other
beers
have
certainly
a
nice
change
for
them
overall
this
is
a
great
esb
perhaps
the
best
ive
ever
had
nice
and
bitter
but
not
overly
powerful
the
beer
is
strong
at
6
5
yet
still
feels
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
highly
recommend
this
anyone
who
otherwise
enjoys
a
strong
pale
ale
or
ipa
o
hard
for
me
to
place
but
it
tastes
pretty
good

just
right
slips
over

yet
still

excellent
a
tasty
well
balanced
beer
very
english
in
its
palate
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
without
doubt
ps
the
other
two
previous
griped
mildly
about
price

at
our
neighborhood
fred
meyer
is
completely
reasonable
to
me
the
taste
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
and
the
mouthfeel
finished
a
bit
watery
for
my
liking
not
worth
the
price
nor
do
i
want
22
ounces
of
it
all
4s
this
beer
is
not
that
bad
fosters
premium
ale
brewed
by
fosters
group
limited
with
an
abv
of
5
50
this
brew
pours
out
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
i
like
the
color
of
this
brew
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
malts
and
sweetness
you
pick
up
on
a
hit
of
hops
at
the
end
now
for
the
taste
it
is
bold
but
rich
with
flavor
fosters
premium
ale
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
extra
special
strong
bitter
esb
fosters
group
limited
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
fosters
premium
ale
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
rich
and
bold
i
like
how
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
justify
rating
with
a
review
ehh
more
like
motor
oil
than
beer
looks
great
in
a
glass
though
i
actually
am
enjoying
this
beer
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
left
lacing
in
the
glass
the
smell
was
average
and
the
taste
was
better
than
average
in
my
opinion
i
tasted
a
little
dirty
grain
hiding
behind
the
malt
and
hops
other
than
that
id
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
at
the
beach
i
honestly
didnt
expect
this
to
be
even
worse
than
the
lager
utterly
putrid
macro
swill
fosters
australian
for
ass
overall
decent
but
certainly
not
outstanding
overall
this
isnt
anything
bad
id
rather
drink
a
pale
lager
or
some
of
the
malt
liquors
out
there
than
this
it
is
5
5
so
itll
get
the
job
done
after
3
cans
but
i
think
some
lagers
and
malt
liquors
have
more
consistency
throughout
a
canbottle
this
one
just
had
the
weirdest
bitter
grainy
yeasty
flavor
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
but
id
just
rather
drink
the
fosters
lager
fosters
premium
ale
gets
a
79100
for
me
its
not
terrible
aroma
is
a
bit
funky
and
grainy
pour
is
nice
clear
light
amber
with
a
full
white
head
head
dissipated
quickly
but
left
attractive
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
however
it
is
bitey
and
grainy
best
drunk
ice
cold
it
becomes
more
bitter
and
less
fulsome
as
it
warms
2

c
overall
this
is
better
than
i
imagined
i
really
dont
want
to
finish
this
whole
can
time
to
guzzle
overall
if
you
havent
tried
the
oil
can
frim
ft
worth
you
need
to
give
it
a
go
tasty
esb
this
beer
is
purely
a
novelty
i
picked
one
up
at
the
store
with
that
in
mind
no
high
expectations
it
looks
amazing
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
everything
else
went
downhill
smells
like
a
40
of
malt
liquor
tastes
kind
of
like
one
as
well
im
not
going
to
get
into
detail
its
just
not
worth
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
better
than
the
taste
overall
i
give
this
a
2
5
below
average
i
havent
tried
fosters
before
this
oil
can
i
was
told
this
tastes
just
like
vb
victoria
bitter
another
australian
beer
thats
hard
to
find
in
the
us
i
didnt
like
it
too
sour
too
flat
no
smell
i
did
not
enjoy
perhaps
i
would
like
regular
fosters
in
the
blue
can
i
dont
think
i
am
going
to
be
trying
that
out
anytime
soon
o
i
am
really
surprised
by
this
one
didnt
think
fosters
had
it
in
them
at
two
dollars
its
a
good
bargain
might
buy
this
again
pours
a
deep
copper
gold
with
a
thin
beige
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
but
just
near
the
top
of
the
brew
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
malts
with
some
hops
nothing
special
the
taste
is
the
same
with
the
malts
right
up
from
followed
by
a
hint
of
corn
sweetness
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
that
was
a
little
hoppy
overall
not
a
big
deal
o
got
this
for
2
beats
the
snot
out
of
the
bland
heineken
that
costs
a
buck
more
if
you
enjoy
a
pleasant
hoppy
brew
like
me
kick
back
and
enjoy
overall
the
beer
looks
decent
but
not
much
of
a
flavor
profile
this
is
so
not
a
fair
dinkum
premium
and
i
bought
5
cans
of
this
stuff
like
another
reviewer
said
this
is
better
than
their
lager
i
like
the
appearance
but
the
smell
oh
my
god
it
smelled
like
the
florida
everglades
after
a
rainy
day
the
taste
was
ok
mouthfeel
a
bit
grassy
and
skunky
yeah
overall
i
will
drink
it
again
nice
lawnmower
beer
and
remember
folks
keep
drinking
beer
and
support
your
local
brewery
hog
overall
this
beer
is
on
the
verge
of
being
a
really
good
tasting
ale
its
definitely
better
than
the
fosters
lager
this
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
there
is
a
slightly
bitteryeasty
aroma
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
body
was
pretty
average
but
the
overall
taste
was
pretty
good
given
the
rating
quite
a
bit
better
tasting
than
regular
fosters
o
worth
a
try
actually
fits
well
within
the
style
of
esb
for
what
i
know
premium
ale
tries
to
be
something
more
significant
and
meaningful
but
takes
the
fun
out
of
the
refreshing
and
mostlymindless
fosters
lager
i
will
say
the
alcohol
warming
was
neat
and
memorable
perhaps
st
bernard
dogs
can
replace
their
brandy
casks
with
this
cheaper
alternative
this
beer
is
a
cheap
macrobrew
import
please
keep
that
in
mind
as
you
buy
it
if
you
go
in
expecting
craftmicrobrew
quality
you
are
going
to
be
disappointed
that
being
said
i
was
rather
surprised
at
how
drinkable
and
even
enjoyable
this
beer
is
its
basically
an
esb
with
a
bitter
but
not
too
aggressive
hop
bite
and
some
nice
malty
flavors
the
smell
is
not
so
good
but
everything
else
is
rather
better
than
i
would
have
expected
from
the
price
2
50
for
an
oilcan
where
i
live
and
thats
from
a
grocery
store
if
youre
feeling
a
bit
pinched
in
the
wallet
and
cant
afford
anything
better
consider
giving
this
a
try
its
miles
ahead
of
the
regular
fosters
lager
and
no
more
expensive
drinkability
as
far
as
macros
go
this
is
a
good
deal
its
totally
quaffable
bitter
without
being
overpoering
and
very
smooth
oil
can
from
specs
in
houston
this
was
brewed
in
fort
worth
texas
under
contract
from
fosters
pours
out
to
a
decent
1
inch
head
that
falls
to
a
permanent
yet
thin
head
with
minimal
lacing
color
is
admittedly
artificial
caramel
color
added
to
give
this
ersatz
esb
a
goldenamber
hue
aroma
is
classic
fosters
lager
with
bready
notes
and
grassy
hops
and
loud
grains
flavor
is
musty
crackery
and
strangely
boozy
with
a
dry
honey
graham
cracker
finish
dont
ask
me
to
explain
mouthfeel
is
light
it
appears
they
took
a
higher
gravity
warmer
fermented
fosters
lager
and
doctored
the
flavor
and
appearance
up
a
bit
after
a
long
day
of
stress
anxiety
problem
solving
and
working
for
the
man
i
arrive
home
and
crack
open
a
25
4oz
can
of
fosters
premium
ale
wow
life
is
good
again
im
not
a
connoisseur
of
beer
but
man
o
man
i
do
like
this
stuff
after
a
can
of
fosters
premium
ale
ive
got
a
nice
buzz
on
and
no
harm
done
perfect
taste
perfect
size
perfect
buzz
perfect
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
times
when
you
dont
want
a
super
complex
beer
but
still
want
something
you
can
actually
taste
its
above
quite
a
few
other
beers
in
its
respective
price
point
and
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
body
it
leaves
the
tongue
dry
especially
in
the
center
light
body
medium
effervescence
nothing
to
really
recommend
this
beer
at
best
its
lawnmower
beer
their
lager
is
better
and
i
am
not
a
lager
fan
overall
this
is
not
an
esb
i
think
this
fits
more
into
the
cream
ale
category
with
its
low
bitterness
light
flavors
and
light
body
not
impressed
but
i
think
its
better
than
regular
fosters
o
this
beers
seems
a
little
more
bitter
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
this
isnt
necessarily
bad
as
it
helps
to
mask
the
adjunct
aromas
and
flavors
an
okay
yet
spotty
beer
the
strange
aroma
really
detracts
from
an
otherwise
great
looking
and
decently
drinkable
brew
the
pluses
still
outweigh
the
negatives
and
for
the
price
2
19
for
the
oil
can
this
is
still
a
good
bargain
for
a
brew
o
i
still
love
the
fact
that
fosters
sells
their
beers
in
the
oil
cans
one
of
my
favorite
formats
for
beer
even
if
the
actual
brew
that
comes
in
them
is
not
great
i
much
prefer
this
to
the
traditional
blue
and
gold
can
version
of
fosters
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
beer
but
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
fosters
premium
ale
2013
it
simply
cannot
be
summer
unless
i
have
a
fosters
thats
just
the
way
it
is
for
me
though
no
longer
brewed
in
australia
and
imported
a
few
years
back
they
switched
to
inspired
breweries
in
georgia
and
texas
the
taste
is
more
or
less
the
same
thick
creamy
head
mellows
to
good
lacing
straw
colored
with
a
hint
of
ruby
light
airy
aroma
barely
there
soft
smooth
mouthfeel

wafts
into

midtaste
and
then
finished
with
a
bitter

finish
sour
and
bitter

linger
slight
copper
and
just
a
hint
of

spice
very
drinkable
good
hot

hot
night
drink
clean
aussie
ale
taste
its
lager
cousin
comes
in
the
blue
can
this
is
green
the
oil
can
supersized
beer
makes
you
feel
manly
its
a
marketing
ploy
but
ill
bite
into
it
just
has
that
feel
or
real
beer
though
it
is
arguably
the
budweiser
of
australia
either
way
as
a
commodity
drink
it
is
enjoyable
and
just
right
for
this
time
of
year
despite
its
middle
of
the
road
quality
3
25
out
of
5
good
yeah
not
the
best
but
i
could
imagine
quite
good
on
a
hot
day
and
served
iced
cold
mine
was
cold
but
it
could
have
used
another
hour
in
the
freezer
but
at
325
4oz
can
you
really
complain
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
dont
take
the
bitter
ale
labeldesignation
very
seriously
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
with
a
bit
more
flavor
and
color
than
usual
however
i
would
take
it
over
any
typical
watery
adjunct
beer
overall
this
is
not
a
truly
offensive
beer
its
quite
light
and
drinkable
and
for
its
flaws
it
ends
up
being
pretty
alright
actually
struth
od
bought
this
one
for
the
novelty
wasnt
appalled
but
definitely
wasnt
impressed
and
didnt
find
this
one
memborable
didnt
finish
the
can
o
alcoholic
water
anyone
this
is
actually
5
5
abv
but
none
in
the
taste
always
give
points
for
above
average
abv
a
tiny
little
bit
bitter
guess
this
was
considered
an
esb
before
the
rise
of
the
craft
brew
scene
a
bit
more
malty
breadyness
and
this
would
be
a
keeper
not
bad
for
a
adjunct
the
appearance
was
nice
the
taste
did
not
mach
it
you
need
to
be
a
beers
beer
drinker
to
like
it
in
any
way
overall
this
beer
is
somewhat
refreshing
but
it
just
seems
a
bit
artificial
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
premium
my
ass
final
thoughts
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
macroale
tastes
like
look
no
further
than
fosters
premium
ale
would
i
drink
it
again
unlikely
the
taste
is
perfect
lower
appearance
score
is
because
of
the
can
i
just
phoned
the
company
and
asked
for
bottles
the
rep
sounded
excited
at
the
thought
could
happen
with
some
help
this
is
my
first
posting
ever
on
this
site
i
am
looking
forward
to
that
first
bottle
its
light
and
not
very
pale
i
am
not
a
fan
of
ipa
but
i
do
like
bitter
ales
and
this
ale
holds
up
to
my
standards
cool
and
refreshing
o
overall
pretty
bad
not
horrendous
though
ill
pass
on
having
this
one
again
overall
fosters
premium
ale
is
an
average
beer
there
is
light
carbonation
with
fosters
premium
ale
the
carbonation
does
not
diminish
with
time
the
alcohol
content
was
not
very
strong
people
who
enjoy
beers
that
conatain
low
alcohol
should
try
fosters
premium
ale
drink
meh
i
know
why
i
didnt
review
it
before
last
night
i
forgot
i
didnt
want
to
drink
it
again
at
least
it
was
free
hope
the
blue
can
is
maybe
a
bit
better
overall
ok
if
it
wasnt
for
the
paper
taste
that
comes
to
the
tongue
at
the
end
it
would
actually
be
a
beer
i
would
go
to
on
more
occasion
as
a
session
but
since
the
taste
is
there
i
would
likely
take
something
else
this
isnt
great
but
its
probably
the
best
beer
produced
by
this
brewery
not
a
bad
deal
at
1
99
at
the
supermarket
taste
this
is
better
then
the
smell
for
sure
it
starts
with
that
alcohol
type
taste
but
it
changes
to
a
slight
malty
sweetness
that
ends
with
a
slight
bitterness
with
not
very
much
aftertaste
overall
not
the
best
ale
in
the
world
but
certainly
drinkable
and
goes
good
with
a
nice
partagas
or
cohiba
i
enjoyed
it
overall
geez
i
havent
had
a
fosters
green
can
in
well
over
two
years
and
now
i
know
ive
graduated
into
fullon
beer
snob
i
could
smell
the
cheap
ingredients
from
a
mile
away
and
the
taste
was
no
different
once
upon
a
time
i
thought
this
beer
had
a
nice
distinct
bitterness
now
i
find
it
disappointing
at
best
laughable
at
worst
overall
its
certainly
drinkable
and
has
a
good
body
and
a
decent
sweetness
but
if
my
review
were
a
few
years
ago
i
probably
wouldve
rated
this
higher
and
i
was
drinking
great
beer
at
the
time
which
begs
the
question
has
this
beer
gone
downhill
or
has
my
palate
taken
a
considerable
leap
25
4
oz
oil
can
pours
a
really
nice
copper
color
along
the
lines
of
a
microbrewed
pale
ale
i
was
going
to
rate
this
higher
in
appearance
until
i
saw
the
words
caramel
color
added
on
the
side
of
the
can
kinda
like
cheating
imho
im
not
getting
much
of
an
aroma
at
all
on
this
brew
but
there
is
some
rather
lively
carbonation
first
sip
brings
a
sharp
metallic
bitterness
almost
saaz
hops
like
with
a
mild
malty
backbone
and
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
decent
not
heavy
or
watery
overall
for
a
mass
produced
beer
this
is
well
decent
not
up
to
the
standards
of
snpa
or
dales
pale
ale
but
i
could
see
myself
being
quite
content
being
at
a
cookout
washing
down
some
grilled
food
with
these
overall
good
beer
it
is
simple
and
doesnt
hurt
to
drink
had
it
after
a
meal
because
didnt
want
anything
too
strong
salud
o
well
ive
actually
had
this
beer
a
fair
amount
of
times
throughout
my
lifetime
and
recently
saw
it
for
a
1
35
for
a
25
4
oz
can
and
thought
well
ive
never
reviewed
this
beer
might
as
well
sit
down
and
see
how
she
does
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
could
have
all
of
the
time
however
im
only
wondering
why
this
is
an
esb
because
it
just
seems
more
of
an
adjunct
o
honestly
for
1
50
a
25
4
oz
can
there
are
many
many
worse
options
very
easy
drinking
as
a
kicking
around
a
bbq
or
couch
not
exactly
stunning
but
not
bad
all
things
considered
i
wouldnt
rank
it
that
much
higher
in
drinkability
than
other
beers
tastewise
its
just
confusing
if
you
need
to
get
drunk
its
servicable
with
its
5
5
abv
drink
ice
cold
and
with
something
salty
like
pretzels
to
work
out
a
balance
in
taste
the
beer
looks
great
when
its
poured
but
doesnt
have
anywhere
near
the
character
youd
expect
theres
almost
no
smell
and
other
than
a
hint
of
malt
theres
no
taste
its
a
heavy
beer
its
not
a
thirst
quencher
and
its
too
heavy
to
drink
much
but
having
one
or
two
with
a
friend
would
be
nice
nothing
to
brag
home
about
though
fosters
premium
ale
pours
a
nice
amber
color
although
it
is
aided
by
caramel
color
being
added
as
noted
on
the
can
the
head
is
pillowy
off
white
and
actually
sticks
around
for
a
while
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
this
further
this
medium
bodied
brew
has
a
nice
malty
taste
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
a
mild
hop
bitterness
rounds
out
this
solid
offering
this
is
certainly
one
to
try
and
the
oil
can
is
a
nice
touch
tastes
light
and
pretty
bland
some
crackers
and
bread
vague
apple
from
the
yeast
seems
more
like
an
oktoberfest
or
vienna
lager
dry
aftertaste
sort
of
a
foamy
thin
feel
overall
its
not
terrible
seems
free
of
adjuncts
but
its
nothing
unique
or
flavorful
either
no
off
flavors
just
pure
and
simple
beer
likely
an
easy
match
with
most
foods
not
something
id
go
for
again
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
lacing
or
anything
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
malty
but
nothing
much
else
really
stands
out
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonated
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
brew
all
that
much
goes
down
pretty
good
probably
one
of
the
best
beer
i
can
find
in
my
grocery
store
o
i
dont
know
why
i
chose
to
pick
this
up
tonight
but
i
did
kinda
glad
too
this
isnt
that
darn
bad
for
an
overmarketed
with
a
gimmicky
campaign
intended
to
appeal
to
off
center
hipsters
that
dont
want
to
commit
to
actual
good
imports
and
micros
beer
not
a
great
esb
but
definitely
better
than
your
regular
fosters
its
enjoyable
and
drinkable
plus
its
in
an
oil
can
which
can
really
add
some
manliness
to
a
tailgate
o
just
average
not
bad
not
great
much
better
than
their
lager
appears
a
pale
copper
color
with
a
light
white
head
forming
thick
and
sticking
around
for
quite
awhile
fine
loosely
formed
speckled
lacing
around
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
cereal
grains
with
some
cooked
vegetable
notes
with
hints
of
caramel
flavor
pretty
harsh
flavor
a
bit
of
grainy
sweetness
filtered
through
some
dirty
husky
malts
probably
a
better
idea
to
serve
this
cold
out
of
the
oil
can
than
drinking
it
from
a
glass
more
harsness
cooked
vegetables
and
everything
unenjoyable
in
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
highly
carbonated
quite
a
boring
experience
overall
not
well
made
beer
in
any
regards
why
drink
this
with
so
many
craft
options
out
there
bought
a
25
ounce
can
at
the
local
gas
station
and
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
is
definately
a
better
beer
than
the
adjunct
mainstream
fosters
but
i
cant
get
past
the
smell
of
this
one
everytime
i
take
a
sip
from
the
glass
i
get
a
mild
fart
smell
otherwise
the
color
head
texture
and
taste
is
acceptable
nice
oilcan
packaging
pours
nicely
to
an
amber
color
with
good
head
nice
nose
has
some
grains
and
cooked
vegetable
perhaps
cabbage
tingly
herbal
hops
mingle
with
sweet
grain
flavors
on
the
palate
some
fruity
flavors
too
wish
i
had
left
beer
in
can
so
it
would
feel
cooler
drinking
this
i
dont
drink
many
esbs
so
its
tough
to
describe
but
when
this
is
fresh
its
a
great
beer
with
bolder
bitter
flavors
that
can
be
had
alone
or
to
follow
heavier
ipas
a
big
can
of
this
is
a
great
counterpart
to
a
powerful
ipa
where
most
regular
beers
wouldnt
hold
up
flavorwise
an
above
average
outing
for
fosters
i
will
take
this
one
over
their
regular
lager
any
day
nice
pour
with
a
light
amber
color
and
respectable
lace
that
hung
around
for
awhile
smell
was
of
grain
and
sweetness
but
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
as
well
flavor
is
smoothe
yet
not
too
complex
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
in
the
front
and
your
standard
astringency
in
the
middle
decent
clean
finish
and
balanced
carbonation
round
out
this
brew
a
simple
and
effective
brew
nothing
more
nothing
less
overall
offers
a
good
taste
not
a
deep
beer
in
respect
to
is
flavor
profile
but
more
than
i
was
expecting
which
is
nice
o
good
beer
that
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
summer
day
much
better
than
i
remember
or
expected
when
you
need
a
manly
beer
to
impress
your
buddies
this
is
it
the
artificial
coloring
added
does
tarnish
the
image
a
bit
but
no
one
reads
the
labels
anyhow
o
right
on
the
can
ale
with
caramel
color
added
well
there
goes
the
appearance
decent
drinkability
do
i
think
this
really
should
be
in
the
esb
style
probably
not
ill
place
this
a
notch
above
bmc
macros
decent
flavor
with
decent
drinkability
if
nothing
i
preferred
was
available
i
would
drink
this
again
3
5
o
not
very
good
at
all
thanks
but
ill
buy
a
beer
that
is
colored
through
the
brewing
process
i
should
have
read
the
label
before
purchasing
it
as
i
never
would
have
then
purchased
it
pours
a
clear
copper
orange
with
a
2
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
random
patterns
and
legs
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
grains
light
fruit
aromas
and
a
metallic
essence
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
the
metallic
flavor
lingering
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
very
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
flat
and
astringent
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
but
now
i
can
finally
say
that
i
tried
fosters
finally
i
would
not
buy
this
one
again
i
think
this
is
a
great
easydrinking
ale
i
know
most
say
its
another
crappy
macro
hey
i
love
a
pungent
and
hoppy
brew
as
much
as
anyone
else
but
occasionally
it
is
nice
to
enjoy
a
simple
beer
without
a
flavor
overload
the
third
entry
in
swillfest
2011
it
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
plenty
of
dirty
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mud
bad
hops
wallaby
sweat
soap
and
stale
biscuits
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toffee
dirt
greens
balsa
egg
white
grass
and
flowers
its
not
as
bad
as
the
smell
let
on
but
it
sure
as
hell
aint
very
good
either
the
body
is
a
mediumlight
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
an
almost
grainy
feel
overall
not
a
good
beer
all
around
especially
if
you
really
consider
this
an
esb
this
beer
looks
golden
amber
with
some
white
foam
that
l
think
is
deceptive
because
as
i
go
to
smell
it
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
rotting
kangaroo
this
is
not
that
great
on
the
front
im
scared
that
i
actually
taste
hops
in
here
though
there
is
some
biscuit
the
rotten
hops
are
getting
progressively
worse
i
dont
like
drinking
this
beer
its
a
bad
example
of
the
style
a
very
bad
example
for
those
of
you
who
havent
had
this
beer
you
should
definitely
try
it
i
for
one
am
not
a
big
fan
of
overbearing
hops
but
while
this
brew
is
heavy
on
hops
its
also
perfectly
balanced
with
malts
and
sweetness
this
is
definitely
one
beer
to
try
if
you
havent
had
it
i
really
think
beeradvocate
gives
it
a
worser
rating
than
its
due
i
mean
i
know
this
isnt
the
place
for
macros
and
i
like
macros
but
this
is
the
most
fullflavored
macro
beer
ive
ever
had
simple
cheap
and
enjoyable
the
oversized
can
makes
it
hard
to
get
a
good
pour
but
it
is
still
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
considering
the
price
about
equivalent
to
bud
here
at
2
for
the
can
with
a
tastes
that
puts
our
macros
to
shame
an
all
around
average
esb
but
it
might
be
nice
to
pick
up
a
can
to
sip
on
while
watching
a
movie
with
some
popcorn
or
something
overall
i
figured
i
would
try
this
ive
never
had
this
before
and
have
always
wanted
to
since
i
was
younger
due
to
those
commercials
well
if
fosters
is
actually
australian
for
beer
i
feel
bad
for
the
aussies
this
unenjoyable
cheap
brew
leaves
nothing
to
say
except
no
thanks
this
beer
feels
its
only
made
for
college
frat
boys
who
want
to
get
drunk
the
flavor
is
generic
and
sour
not
smooth
one
bit
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
also
the
can
has
too
big
of
a
mouth
hole
its
sure
to
cause
drunkard
sloppy
spillage
dpretty
easy
drinking
but
not
complex
in
the
least
bit
reminds
me
more
of
an
amber
lager
than
an
esb
the
bitterness
leaves
a
taste
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
that
is
not
interesting
in
short
its
a
bland
beer
with
no
exceptional
qualities
that
can
be
worth
discussion
out
with
the
bad
in
with
the
good
its
taste
maybe
be
bland
but
leaves
one
with
a
buzz
that
makes
on
efeel
on
top
of
the
world
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
briskly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
alright
overall
not
the
best
brew
id
take
a
fosters
lager
over
this
any
day
this
is
just
too
sweet
rjt
i
love
these
gigantor
cans
cause
the
crack
is
massive
like
racking
a
shell
into
a
shotgun
in
a
dark
alley
the
glug
can
be
problematic
however
due
to
the
positioning
of
the
opening
a
little
further
back
than
on
smaller
cans
sure
enough
i
had
some
minor
spillage
along
with
a
massive
twoplus
fingers
of
thick
tawny
head
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
was
slightly
sulfurous
with
some
faint
malt
underlying
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
pleasant
admixture
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
it
was
not
quite
as
balanced
as
the
wells
esb
i
had
last
night
but
it
was
not
bad
either
finish
was
tending
more
toward
sweet
than
bitter
and
i
quickly
realized
that
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
would
be
plenty
i
might
have
a
cooler
full
of
fosters
premium
ale
if
i
wanted
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
but
otherwise
i
am
not
devoting
a
whole
lot
of
space
to
it
not
too
bad
for
a
2
75
oilcan
ive
had
far
worse
although
id
have
trouble
identifying
this
as
an
esb
update
ive
gone
back
after
over
a
year
of
further
beer
drinking
experience
and
had
to
lower
my
score
a
bit
it
is
still
a
surprising
gem
considering
the
presentation
in
my
area
it
is
sold
only
in
25
4
oz
single
cans
alongside
budget
beers
and
malt
liquors
though
for
a
slightly
higher
price
tag
ive
still
never
seen
it
available
in
6packs
it
is
many
many
times
better
than
fosters
lager
could
ever
hope
to
be
as
well
however
it
does
have
shortcomings
it
tastes
very
very
fake
while
the
astringency
may
taste
perfect
it
doesnt
taste
like
its
necessarily
imparted
by
hops
it
could
just
as
well
be
some
artificial
chemical
bittering
agent
im
really
picky
about
hops
getting
too
upfront
with
their
own
flavour
and
masking
the
beers
so
this
doesnt
bother
me
too
much
the
malt
flavour
is
sort
of
oddly
fake
too
though
the
sweetness
while
once
again
in
the
perfect
amount
tastes
oddly
of
red
grapes
just
a
wee
bit
which
makes
no
sense
in
a
beer
i
still
dont
find
that
offensive
but
both
of
those
things
combined
just
makes
this
beer
reek
of
fake
flavours
and
a
lack
of
freshness
however
i
stand
by
my
original
proclamation
that
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
and
for
the
price
is
totally
worth
it
every
time
it
is
really
a
gem
in
the
budget
beer
isle
i
challenge
you
to
give
it
a
try
overall
a
good
drink
but
nothing
special
a
so
so
session
beer
but
rather
boring
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
onefinger
fizzyfoamy
white
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainy
ricy
with
some
malt
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
kinda
malty
grainy
lightmedium
body
not
a
bad
brew
but
still
would
not
try
again
i
drank
this
right
from
the
can
so
cannot
comment
on
its
appearance
the
taste
reminded
me
more
of
an
american
malt
liquor
more
than
anything
else
with
a
strong
hop
presence
not
one
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
anymorei
was
able
to
finish
the
can
over
an
hours
time
but
would
not
want
a
second
one
in
one
sitting
overall
it
seems
like
they
wanted
to
make
an
ale
but
ended
up
with
a
mediocre
tasting
vienna
lager
or
something
i
didnt
hate
it
but
not
sure
why
theyd
mass
produce
this
stuff
at
least
it
was
cheap
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
although
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
are
better
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
i
had
anticipated
and
would
be
an
acceptable
alternative
if
i
were
in
a
situation
where
this
beer
was
one
of
a
few
limited
choices
i
think
this
beer
isnt
a
very
accurate
type
of
esb
but
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
for
a
cheap
beer
and
from
the
reviews
it
seems
to
be
better
than
fosters
lager
this
beer
would
be
good
if
they
didnt
use
the
caramel
color
you
can
see
they
use
it
and
taste
they
use
it
it
pretty
much
tastes
fake
maybe
if
i
never
had
a
good
beer
before
and
didnt
know
they
used
caramel
color
additive
i
would
think
this
is
good
but
really
its
not
it
tries
to
be
something
its
not
it
smells
grainy
with
a
hint
of
floral
the
taste
is
just
this
oily
fake
caramel
taste
with
the
sharp
hops
it
tastes
like
a
fake
boston
lager
but
in
no
way
does
this
compare
to
that
quality
beer
i
would
rate
this
double
if
it
werent
for
this
odd
taste
that
beer
shouldnt
have
it
has
a
mouthfeel
that
you
can
tell
is
off
i
bought
an
oil
can
of
this
and
finished
the
first
glass
but
now
that
i
have
the
rest
of
the
can
poured
im
thinking
of
not
even
finishing
it
and
just
grabbing
another
beer
thats
in
the
fridge
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
ive
had
because
of
this
odd
additive
not
a
bad
version
of
an
esb
nice
fluffy
white
head
on
the
glass
with
a
very
clear
amber
fluid
decent
lace
and
no
real
carbonation
evident
smell
is
light
malt
and
floral
hops
not
much
presence
taste
has
a
bigger
malt
presence
with
a
toasted
grainy
quality
a
touch
of
metallic
sourness
that
works
here
sweet
roll
breadiness
flowing
into
floral
hops
a
bit
of
earth
and
a
clean
finish
with
a
light
bread
and
hop
linger
pretty
well
balanced
with
a
tilt
toward
the
english
hoppy
side
feel
is
a
bit
light
but
nicely
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
and
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
decent
brew
and
reasonably
priced
sidenote
i
dont
read
the
reviews
on
here
before
or
when
im
reviewing
a
beer
but
i
swear
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
bit
fake
while
i
was
sampling
it
i
come
to
find
that
there
is
caramel
color
added
lol
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
attempts
ive
seen
at
an
esb
from
the
big
guys
i
just
dont
think
that
macro
breweries
do
ales
all
that
well
and
this
isnt
much
of
an
exception
i
would
however
take
this
over
regular
fosters
lager
any
day
of
the
week
or
any
other
macro
import
lager
for
that
matter
drinkability
i
could
drink
another
its
pretty
good
after
i
drink
one
i
always
feel
like
i
conquered
a
mountain
d
not
very
good
the
weird
bitterness
doesnt
do
it
for
me
m
d
drinkable
for
the
price
not
a
typical
ale
someone
mentioned
that
the
color
is
due
to
added
coloration
but
i
missed
that
if
it
was
in
fact
mentioned
on
the
can
if
so
maybe
that
would
be
the
reason
for
the
sweetness
as
well
edit
immediately
after
reviewing
this
beer
i
checked
out
the
can
and
found
the
description
ale
with
caramel
color
added
in
my
eyes
this
is
cheating
since
this
copper
color
was
based
on
lies
rather
than
malt
i
am
deducting
2
5
points
from
the
appearance
score
bringing
it
from
a
4
5
to
a
2
this
is
the
first
and
last
of
these
i
will
be
drinking
not
recommended
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
booze
and
maybe
some
barley
maybe
a
little
sweet
tastes
bitter
and
sweet
really
malty
and
very
one
note
quite
terrible
a
lot
like
piss
mouthfeel
is
less
than
desirable
drinkability
is
poor
this
is
a
good
beer
very
surprising
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
a
bit
watery
its
light
and
easy
drinking
overall
its
a
decent
macro
beer
its
refreshing
though
dnot
very
drinkable
i
would
never
purchase
this
again
the
taste
was
not
very
good
on
the
can
it
reads
carmel
color
added
to
me
that
said
it
all
the
taste
was
not
genuine
and
like
the
smell
it
tasted
manufactured
i
did
not
taste
the
esb
quality
in
this
at
all
i
would
never
under
any
circumstance
purchase
this
again
nor
would
i
encourage
others
to
try
it
there
are
better
tasting
mass
produced
beers
out
there
skip
this
one
because
it
is
trying
to
hard
to
be
premium
drinkability
i
could
drink
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
before
tiring
of
it
probably
wont
buy
it
again
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
slightly
over
medium
this
beer
is
way
off
course
for
a
good
esb
the
hops
are
muddled
the
inital
flavor
is
odd
and
there
is
a
funky
taste
there
is
no
distinction
in
the
beer
and
the
odd
aftertaste
gives
the
beer
bad
vibesdude
d
i
kinda
wish
that
i
grabbed
the
special
bitter
but
overall
for
this
style
its
not
half
bad
drinkability
not
a
terrible
beer
but
nothing
i
would
get
too
excited
about
maybe
worth
a
taste
but
not
a
second
look
not
bad
at
all
good
price
at
2
50
for
this
oil
can
i
know
ill
have
another
somewhere
down
the
road
taste
is
better
than
expected
little
malt
corn
possibly
with
the
type
of
sweetness
works
ok
but
a
good
bitter
twang
to
it
all
bittering
hops
feel
to
the
beer
little
to
evaluate
mouthfeel
wise
its
a
one
trick
pony
for
better
andor
worse
cheap
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
to
a
degree
skål
overall
a
crappy
beer
trying
to
look
like
a
craft
beer
but
it
fails
hard
buy
this
again
hell
no
i
was
coming
into
this
with
a
memory
of
the
beer
being
great
this
is
no
esb
bitch
creek
is
the
way
to
go
d
this
is
quite
a
good
value
at
2
for
a
750
a
beer
to
pick
up
on
the
cheap
for
sure
d
a
perfect
session
ale
that
has
a
nice
abv
to
it
if
i
had
to
drink
a
sub
par
beer
this
one
would
fit
the
bill
kinda
hard
to
pour
out
of
this
big
ol
25
5
oz
can
slow
from
the
start
appearance
has
a
nice
amber
glow
with
a
thick
slowly
dissapating
head
and
surprising
lace
smell
of
malty
bitter
graininess
with
a
faint
caramel
note
taste
of
thin
watered
down
malts
that
brings
out
more
of
the
hop
that
linger
a
bit
mouthfeel
has
almost
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
or
great
but
a
fairly
easy
drinker
this
is
a
fairly
tame
esb
its
watery
with
a
sweet
malt
i
dont
find
it
to
be
very
bitter
at
all
though
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
has
enough
hops
in
it
to
get
a
proper
bitter
flavor
overall
this
this
ale
is
a
let
down
i
doubt
most
whod
drink
this
would
know
its
supposed
to
be
in
the
esb
style
buy
again
yes
what
we
have
here
is
another
beer
that
tastes
great
is
inexpensive
and
rewards
me
well
at
the
end
of
a
hard
days
worth
of
work
in
the
field
pours
out
a
dark
honey
color
with
a
sticky
3
finger
head
of
foam
that
sticks
around
awhile
thick
gooey
lacing
smelled
like
lightly
smoked
malt
tasted
watered
down
with
a
faint
hopmalt
tone
not
impressed
with
this
beer
drinkability
was
good
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
if
this
is
their
premium
ale
i
will
pass
on
the
midgrade
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
easy
mostly
very
boring
and
disappointing
for
this
ale
to
be
so
light
and
similar
to
its
lager
sister
never
again
but
everything
gets
a
chance
drinkable
but
sort
of
average
it
has
a
lot
of
lager
qualities
particularly
the
smell
and
taste
it
is
a
lot
better
that
the
fosters
lager
d
rather
easy
putting
the
can
down
faster
than
expected
it
is
naturally
dark
in
color
is
medium
in
carbonation
the
smell
is
nice
at
firt
with
a
nice
smell
of
hops
which
finised
to
a
metallic
smell
it
taste
pretty
decent
it
has
a
good
mouth
feel
and
finishes
clean
which
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
long
it
was
on
sale
i
would
buy
but
not
at
full
price

the
color
of
the
pour
is
honeycopper
with
a
very
bubbly
beige
had
that
pops
and
fizzles
and
slowly
fades
away
lively
carbonation
the
aroma
has
comfortable
aura
of
sweet
malts
but
also
an
offputting
corny
and
grassy
scent
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
slight
dry
mild
hop
finish
i
used
to
love
this
beer
a
long
time
ago
before
i
got
into
the
world
of
crafts
i
am
less
awestruck
now
than
i
was
then
drinkability
not
as
bad
as
it
couldve
been
but
certainly
nothing
special
ill
have
to
try
some
other
esbs
as
im
sure
that
this
isnt
a
very
representative
sample
this
beer
was
a
surprise
love
the
regular
fosters
on
tap
and
the
oil
can
isnt
a
bad
way
to
drink
it
at
least
when
poured
into
a
glass
so
i
figured
id
try
the
ale
that
apparently
is
only
sold
in
our
area
in
the
oil
can
i
expected
something
less
than
i
got
nice
color
amber
with
a
lot
of
foam
in
the
glass
subtle
malt
smell
taste
was
one
dimensional
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
surprisingly
moderate
mouthfeel
and
nice
carbonation
all
in
all
a
refreshing
if
somewhat
boring
beer
i
finished
the
glass
but
didnt
finish
the
can
one
was
enough
and
it
was
time
to
try
something
with
a
little
more
interesting
flavor
profile
d
if
it
werent
for
that
metallic
note
this
would
be
extremely
drinkable
with
the
metallic
taste
it
still
does
all
right
would
probably
session
it
though
it
is
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
for
that
notes
ok
mouthfeel
but
really
just
a
plain
old
dumb
beer
when
i
stopped
for
some
brew
these
babys
where
1
79
per
oil
can
at
the
local
mercado
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
can
is
big
impressive
bright
red
opener
as
to
quickly
identify
where
to
open
pours
into
a
pint
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
nice
pillow
top
colour
is
a
light
brown
or
a
yellow
with
a
brown
twinge
glass
is
too
small
but
then
again
it
is
fosters
smell
is
malty
but
macromalty
taste
is
malty
but
with
a
hint
of
bitters
off
the
bat
it
builds
to
a
more
bitter
finish
but
is
not
overly
bitter
the
head
on
this
brew
is
to
be
commended
it
sticks
to
the
end
the
lacing
is
a
work
of
art
overall
for
this
being
a
macro
ale
it
is
palatable
and
not
too
bad
i
would
drink
again
who
else
has
a
25
4
oz
can
the
novelty
won
me
over
poured
from
a
25
4
oz
can
has
an
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
head
aroma
is
well
missing
for
the
most
part
some
very
mild
malts
taste
is
also
a
bit
light
some
malts
not
a
lot
of
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
soso
drinkability
overall
a
fairly
average
beer
now
if
i
could
only
have
some
more
of
those
emus
and
swans
from
down
under
cheers
this
beer
has
a
light
amber
color
is
clear
and
has
light
to
medium
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
head
as
far
as
aroma
goes
im
getting
nuttiness
a
bit
malty
and
carmel
earthy
ness
the
bodys
light
to
medium
and
bears
the
flavor
of
slight
carmel
blending
nicely
into
a
rounded
hop
taste
that
finishes
in
a
marrying
blend
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
decent
session
sipper
taste
is
very
grape
juicelike
with
a
dry
kind
of
sweetness
not
unlike
champagne
the
hops
provide
some
bitterness
but
not
really
any
flavor
or
presence
at
all
this
is
not
a
good
esb
at
all
hell
its
not
even
a
decent
beer
as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
it
i
would
rather
have
a
fosters
lager
than
this
foul
concoction
i
wonder
if
i
can
finish
the
whole
can
feel
and
drink
as
expected
nice
flavor
but
atypical
for
the
style
tastes
like
a
modified
fosters
lager
not
a
great
brew
for
some
reason
though
i
am
sucker
for
the
oil
can
the
mouth
is
thin
and
watery
hints
of
caramel
but
very
subtle
finishes
bitter
and
drying
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
flavor
department
pretty
average
beer
that
i
will
most
likely
never
get
again
d
the
price
was
right
but
i
could
have
gone
to
trader
joes
with
2
and
come
back
happier
i
hope
that
people
starting
to
get
into
craft
beers
dont
try
this
and
get
turned
off
to
esbs
its
a
horrendous
representation
of
the
style
my
can
looks
different
than
the
one
in
the
picture
ok
final
summary
id
take
another
if
offered
for
free
or
over
an
american
macro
lager
but
thats
as
far
as
it
would
go
youre
hurting
if
you
have
to
add
caramel
color
to
a
beer
d
its
ok
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
again
or
not
its
worth
the
money
however
for
2
99
for
25
oz
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
when
compared
to
other
things
in
the
price
rang
bmc
yet
overall
all
average
a
barely
adequate
beer
not
much
flavor
and
the
crappy
mouthfeel
makes
drinking
a
can
this
big
a
chore
maybe
it
wouldnt
seem
so
bad
in
a
12oz
can
i
dont
know
but
theres
no
reason
in
terms
of
flavor
to
try
one
should
i
see
one
poured
from
the
oil
can
a
messy
pour
maybe
its
meant
to
be
drunk
from
the
can
looks
really
good
deep
darkish
amber
with
fluffy
head
that
reduces
to
lace
smells
metallic
and
tastes
the
same
almost
a
sink
pour
here
ill
not
seek
this
out
the
last
style
id
have
guessed
this
was
an
esb
usually
balanced
style
oil

this
is
definitely
a

its
not

in

and
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
so

its
smooth
and
easy

just
a
beer
foamy
regular
old
beer
not

bad
on

not

but
would
go
any

ive
had
better

not

overall
drinkable
but
uninspiring
there
are
too
many
great
esbs
out
there
to
pick
this
one
up
again
the
drinkability
is
ok
and
a
slight
improvement
over
the
blue
can
but
pales
in
comparison
to
a
typical
english
esb
gotta
drink
the
bad
to
appreciate
the
good
right
i
dont
know
why
but
i
saw
this
and
thought
what
the
heck
oops
this
wasnt
terrible
but
it
was
a
slightly
tastier
macro
thats
all
appearance
was
copper
with
fluffy
white

no
retention
little

smell
wasnt
terrible
lots
of
straw
grass
andor

with
some

taste
was
pretty
bad
again
some
malt
slightly
biscuity
with
some
grain
as
well
actually
a
bit
of
a
ceral
taste
dont
think
ive
experienced
that
yet
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
light
but
not
as
a
light
as
many
american
macros
overall
drinkable
if
you
have
to
nothing
great
but
at
least
its
not
corona
australias
version
of
a
bmc

mate
good
crisp

very
easy
to

750ml
can
from
the
local
hannaford
pours
a
crystalclear
light
amber
body
with
an
impressive
inch
and
a
half
of
offwhite
head
that
persists
much
longer
than
expected
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
hints
of
citrus
hops
characterize
the
aroma
tastes
like
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
kind
of
a
simple
sugary
malty
sweetness
flavor
and
body
hint
at
adjunct
use
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
specific
taste
fairly
light
in
body
with
nothing
really
offensive
or
challenging
in
the
flavor
make
this
a
very
quaffable
beer
for
the
style
this
is
definitely
about
the
most
pedestrian
and
simple
you
can
get
but
as
a
beer
its
not
a
bad
drinker
and
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
it
again
mouthfeel
is
bitter
sweet
malt
adjuncts
add
more
sweetness
dry
crisp
slight
creaminess
not
bad
overall
but
not
amazing
mfd
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
its
not
terribly
offensive
but
its
really
not
too
good
this
beer
fails
bad
at
being
an
esb
but
i
dont
think
it
was
the
intention
of
the
brewer
to
make
an
esb
so
ill
be
lenient
with
it
overall
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
all
i
get
is
bad
macro
lager
worth
the
price
which
isnt
much
this
was
a
very
disappointing
beer
not
only
as
an
ale
but
also
as
a
beer
the
only
taste
was
metallic
there
were
no
hops
or
anything
close
to
making
it
an
esb
definetly
not
recommended
as
a
session
beer
or
as
a
kickaround
beverage
d
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
not
bad
aroma
is
fine
sweet
bread
pudding
upfront
ever
so
slight
tinge
of
hops
at
the
end
flavor
at
first
was
reviling
it
was
a
bit
strange
to
me
a
light
bitter
hop
that
hits
and
dies
instantly
followed
by
a
ton
of
maltiness
its
not
overly
complex
but
i
can
taste
some
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
middle
finishes
very
sweet
almost
cloying
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
sort
of
a
strange
aftertaste
that
lingers
after
the
sip
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
there
is
no
way
i
could
drink
more
that
one
of
these
things
mediumbodied
and
refreshing
fosters
premium
is
inoffensive
lacking
distinction
and
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
interesting
there
is
a
moderate
bitterness
with
a
slightly
numbing
quality
to
it
despite
the
poor
scent
and
questionable
additions
this
beer
is
not
impossible
to
drink
in
fact
it
gets
easier
as
you
get
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
combine
that
with
a
low
price
and
this
is
a
great
beer
to
get
the
party
started
overall
an
ok
beer
it
has
more
flavor
than
the
bigname
american
brews
but
there
is
so
much
better
beer
out
there
go
for
one
of
the
english
or
american
esbs
instead
d
there
are
already
2
beers
called
fosters
special
bitter
and
although
this
is
definitely
a
bitter
the
can
is
different
from
the
other
pics
and
the
abv
is
way
higher
this
can
says
premium
ale
and
special
bitter
and
the
reviews
from
the
others
do
not
do
this
beer
justice
therefore
leading
me
to
believe
this
is
a
different
beer
and
thats
why
im
adding
it
just
seems
strange
that
fosters
would
brew
3
different
esbs
but
at
2
5
3
5
and
5
5
i
suppose
i
could
see
the
sense
in
that
or
the
session
so
to
speak
all
in
all
a
very
surprising
brew
from
a
big
ass
can
that
quenched
my
thirst
and
left
me
wishing
this
was
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
imo
the
only
thing
lacking
is
the
aroma
probably
will
not
seek
out
but
would
drink
again
just
did
not
care
for
it
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
considering
the
great
balance
and
flavor
of
schlaflys
kolsch
style
ale
one
of
the
best
american
kolschstyles
ive
tasted
ive
come
to
expect
at
least
a
touch
of
diacetyl
in
an
esb
and
a
bit
more
than
a
touch
is
acceptable
in
the
style
but
there
is
none
here
what
is
in
this
brew
is
a
huge
mouthful
of
hops
way
more
hops
than
belong
in
any
low
gravity
english
style
ale
this
is
not
an
esb
its
an
an
american
ipa
posturing
with
a
fake
accent
if
you
tried
to
drink
this
beer
at
cellar
temps
the
hops
would
saturate
your
palate
so
you
couldnt
taste
any
malt
at
all
thats
not
to
say
others
wont
like
it
if
your
idea
of
craft
beer
is
yet
another
ipa
youll
probably
like
this
too
considering
the
shelves
in
my
area
are
overflowing
with
ipas
my
opinion
of
this
beer
is
almost
definitely
in
the
minority
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
the
flavor
is
different
than
anything
ive
tasted
before
best
way
i
can
describe
this
excellent
esb
is
crisp
with
light
fruit
aromas
and
floral
apricot
finish
overall
slightly
lighter
more
fruity
than
most
esbs
with
a
lighter
roasted
malt
flavor
very
drinkable
and
nice
but
not
really
a
typical
esb
5

abv
this
is
apparently
an
americanized
version
of
this
style
i
will
say
this
is
the
only
brew
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
but
i
would
bet
a
weeks
pay
that
i
would
find
a
better
one
pretty
easily
not
into
this
one
very
much
at
all
i
have
had
better
esbs
overall
a
pretty
decent
esb
and
great
for
the
price
i
really
do
recommend
getting
his
beer
at
least
once
just
to
contrast
with
the
fullers
esb
i
remember
this
beer
being
a
lot
more
bitter
last
year
and
having
a
much
better
overall
flavor
im
not
sure
if
they
changed
up
the
recipe
or
what
but
it
was
definitely
better
last
year
not
much
flavor
disappointed
o
an
interesting
esb
the
mixture
of
american
and
british
hops
in
this
ale
is
pretty
unique
i
especially
appreciate
what
pilgrim
brings
to
the
table
this
is
very
much
worth
a
try
for
those
who
enjoy
britishstyle
ales
andor
unique
hop
varietals
o
this
winter
esb
schlafly
winter
esb
is
lighter
than
your
average
winter
warmer
providing
another
good
choice
for
the
holidays
if
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
on
a
hot
spring
day
as
well
overall
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
too
much
fruit
and
overly
sticky
make
this
a
bit
of
a
mess
drinkability
is
very
limited
and
it
just
doesnt
seem
that
well
put
together
ill
pass
next
time
light
brown
hued
with
a
good
half
inch
head
of
khaki
colored
foam
brussels
lacing
i
get
a
bit
of
biscuity
malt
and
faint
pine
like
hops
in
the
nose
i
get
some
dark
malt
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
it
is
quickly
followed
by
sharp
bittering
hops
i
get
a
bit
of
a
dry
chalky
mouth
i
get
more
hops
and
a
copper
penny
like
malt
fade
othe
level
of
fruity
flavor
really
caught
me
off
guard
was
expecting
a
maltier
beer
but
the
fruit
flavors
were
rather
nice
overall
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
personally
but
then
again
im
not
really
into
highlyhopped
beers
this
one
was
very
drinkable
just
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
overall
pretty
decent
and
quite
drinkable
seems
to
the
fit
the
style
well
o
not
a
terrible
beer
in
and
of
itself
but
lacking
in
the
malt
richness
of
a
traditional
esb
i
love
esbs
and
most
winter
beers
in
general
this
sounds
and
looks
great
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
im
from
missouri
and
i
like
to
support
the
locals
but
this
is
awful
syrupy
sweet
and
undrinkable
for
me
it
seems
purposely
aggressively
flavored
to
cover
up
any
redeeming
qualities
it
reminds
me
of
their
christmas
ale
they
are
both
way
too
flavored
and
they
both
taste
like
how
a
cheap
christmas
candle
smells
im
a
schalfly
fan
boy
but
have
to
say
this
was
disappointing
a
rich
translucent
brown
with
a
thin
cap
this
beers
smells
sweet
and
bready
the
flavor
is
somewhat
off
there
is
almost
a
buttery
characteristic
to
this
beer
midpalate
that
i
cant
seem
to
shake
sweeness
starts
but
the
buttery
note
cuts
right
through
finish
is
caramel
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
but
the
butteriness
just
lingers
forever
cant
say
id
pick
this
up
again
overall
i
just
love
this
beer
lots
of
variety
in
the
palate
and
not
overloaded
still
a
good
esb
regardless
of
the
month
maybe
my
favorite
schlafly
offering
ever
this
is
an
all
around
well
crafted
beer
it
has
a
rich
doughy
character
with
a
bright
fruity
side
as
well
i
would
enjoy
this
anytime
of
the
year
this
beer
is
labeled
at
an
extra
special
bitter
but
it
is
actually
quite
well
balanced
for
the
style
it
also
is
not
what
i
would
expect
in
any
beer
that
claims
to
be
a
winter
seasonal
the
taste
is
not
spicy
like
other
winter
brews
and
it
is
actually
more
indicative
of
an
everyday
session
type
of
beer
so
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
demands
you
leave
your
preconceived
notions
behind
it
isnt
what
you
think
it
will
be
but
the
results
are
still
satisfying
o
a
nice
brew
the
aroma
was
probably
the
highlight
for
me
it
was
a
smooth
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
would
be
nice
to
put
a
few
glasses
of
these
back
while
hanging
with
good
company
at
a
pub
it
gets
the
job
done
for
sure
nothing
i
would
insist
other
must
try
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
its
not
not
what
i
expected
from
this
style
but
it
is
still
a
good
brew
this
esb
poures
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poures
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
a
average
white
head
decent
retention
and
it
left
behind
a
very
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
ale
contains
malted
grain
and
caramel
medium
bodied
foundation
of
malted
grain
sweet
caramel
and
citrusherbal
bitterness
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
a
nice
session
beer
the
taste
was
a
perfect
winter
variety
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
sweet
malt
backdrop
the
taste
was
well
placed
and
well
balanced
very
nice
subtle
tones
this
drank
easy
with
little
heaviness
in
the
finish
o
a
tasty
brew
but
the
flavor
didnt
quite
match
up
to
the
aroma
would
definitely
get
again
overall
malt
forward
for
the
style
by
my
tastes
and
definitely
full
flavored
whereas
many
of
these
are
watery
poured
from
cask
into
nonic
pint
at
the
taproom
in
stl
pours
a
murky
burnt
orange
with
thick
white
foamy
head
really
sweet
malt
and
lots
of
hop
aroma
taste
is
citrusy
hop
with
sweet
malts
bready
and
mild
smooth
as
silk
really
great
brew
and
im
sure
cask
makes
this
a
bit
smoother
than
bottle
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
nice
representative
of
the
esb
style
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
next
winter
as
it
is
readily
available
locally
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
not
much
head
some
lacing
is
on
the
glass
some
visibility
through
the
pour
smells
of
lemons
soap
some
hops
as
well
as
floral
notes
not
overpowering
but
enjoyable
taste
is
pretty
smooth
nice
hop
presence
with
lemons
and
doughs
up
front
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
mediocre
carbonation
from
the
tap
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
definitely
sessionable
taste
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
sweetness
also
some
kind
of
a
blend
between
orange
and
dark
fruit
for
lack
of
better
words
very
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
delicious
overall
the
breadiness
fruitiness
earthy
hoppiness
and
touch
of
booze
near
the
end
make
this
seem
to
me
pretty
damn
spoton
for
the
style
pours
a
moderate
caramelcopper
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
nice
bit
of
floral
and
earthy
hops
with
some
light
breadiness
behind
that
flavor
was
nice
and
hoppy
and
had
a
good
backbone
though
the
latter
wasnt
too
heavy
lightmedium
body
with
a
semidry
finish
quite
good
overall
this
beer
does
match
its
style
well
the
only
problem
is
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
at
least
in
the
esbs
i
have
drank
so
far
i
thought
the
fruit
flavor
was
a
little
overpowering
although
i
am
sure
some
find
this
to
be
a
redeeming
quality
enjoy
it
for
what
its
worth
its
not
bad
all
in
all
solid
microbrew
think
ill
have
another
overall
with
this
beer
it
is
good
that
the
flavors
are
the
most
impressive
part
it
makes
for
a
much
more
enjoyable
experience
m
thin
to
medium
body
with
good
drinkability
they
hit
the
right
level
of
carbonation
for
this
brew
too
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
one
of
many
from
this
fine
brewer
overall
i
actually
really
like
this
but
its
sort
of
not
what
i
expect
in
this
style
its
an
excellent
beer
no
question
and
ill
have
it
again
someday
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
just
not
quite
hearty
enough
for
me
more
like
a
summer
drink
as
i
could
see
myself
drinking
four
or
five
of
these
pretty
easily
6

abv
is
a
bit
deceptive
id
have
guessed
5
or
less
i
will
get
definitely
get
pick
this
up
again
beer
is
light
to
medium
in
body
mildly
sweet
a
little
spice
perhaps
mild
hops
not
bitter
at
all
an
interesting
little
beer
i
may
have
it
again
but
i
wont
go
far
for
it

thin

creamy
soft

bitter
long
finish
excellent
on
the
palate
with
lots
of
flavor
in
the
finish
this
beer
gets
better
with
warmth
body
is
light
and
crispy
with
plenty
of
tangy
carbonation
easy
to
drink
leaves
you
wanting
another
amber
in
color
with
a
smooth
even
head
of
white
on
top
that
faded
off
after
a
couple
of
moments
light
lacing
was
left
by
the
side
aroma
is
bready
hints
of
caramel
and
grassy
notes
and
warming
brought
out
tons
of
grains
light
crisp
and
clean
taste
light
grassy
hops
and
a
smooth
even
caramel
malt
base
made
up
the
bulk
of
the
profile
light
body
nice
carbonation
and
a
smooth
even
and
clean
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
enjoyable
another
great
beer
from
schlafly
d
very
drinkable
each
sip
brings
something
new
either
malty
sweet
or
bitter
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
i
think
easily
drinkable
and
solid
i
could
handle
a
few
of
these
with
ease
like
most
this
brew
really
shows
its
characteristics
after
it
warms
a
bit
could
be
enjoyed
both
in
the
fall
and
in
the
winter
drinkability
once
again
wondering
why
this
is
a
winter
esb
ale
it
should
be
their
pale
ale
and
i
would
drink
this
weekly
such
a
great
beer
i
split
all
six
with
a
friend
in
two
hours
and
will
have
again
at
the
wolf
public
house
in
ballwin
mo
d
great
esb
the
rye
comes
through
nicely
and
spices
it
up
almost
perfectly
make
this
your
first
if
you
are
going
to
try
a
large
hop
beer
at
the
same
sitting
d
a
very
nice
beer
it
sort
of
works
as
a
winter
beer
not
huge
like
a
ris
but
feels
very
season
appropriate
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
pale
ale
definitely
worth
trying
an
enjoyable
winter
ale
i
dont
really
see
how
this
is
an
esb
but
it
is
still
good
this
reminds
me
of
new
belgium
2
below
with
the
cinnamon
and
vanilla
which
is
a
good
thing
but
not
really
to
style
still
i
really
enjoy
it
and
something
i
would
recommend
overallnotes
the
brew
is
well
constructed
and
pretty
much
straightforward
its
far
from
my
favorite
schlafly
beer
though
the
tartness
of
the
whole
drink
was
really
surprising
it
felt
kind
of
rough
around
the
edges
but
its
still
appealing
enough
for
me
to
go
through
a
couple
without
complaining
which
is
exactly
what
i
did
this
brew
feels
medium
in
body
and
has
a
good
smooth
crispness
very
satisfying
to
the
palate
which
is
left
refreshed
poured
from
the
bottle
a
coppery
amber
hue
with
a
tight
white
rocky
head
that
subsided
into
lacing
for
much
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
dominated
by
the
smell
of
wet
sweet
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
floral
hops
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
and
to
be
honest
there
isnt
as
much
hop
as
i
was
expecting
for
the
esb
from
schlafly
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
quite
not
overly
carbonated
a
tad
on
the
slick
side
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
beer
it
is
a
very
easily
sessionable
beer
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
to
lacing
it
has
a
pleasant
grain
aroma
mixed
with
light
caramel
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
just
enough
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
that
does
not
overpower
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
is
easy
to
have
more
than
one
without
even
thinking
about
it
would
get
this
again
to
try
fresher
but
not
bad
even
with
the
age
drinkability
is
high
with
this
one
due
to
the
drying
effect
it
has
as
well
as
the
conservative
amount
of
hops
quite
an
impressive
ale
with
lots
of
interesting
flavors
going
on
very
refreshing
during
the
winter
months
or
any
time
of
year
for
that
matter
well
done
drinkability
more
of
a
winter
warmer
than
an
esb
i
might
have
rated
it
higher
as
a
winter
warmer
but
i
was
really
looking
for
the
bitter
balance
of
an
esb
that
just
wasnt
there
overall
an
unoffensive
and
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
not
my
favorite
esb
however
and
i
would
have
hoped
for
more
in
the
flavor
nonetheless
nothing
really
off
about
this
one
d
drinkability
is
good
for
this
beer
good
flavor
with
a
dry
ending
that
makes
you
want
to
keep
drinking
more
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
way
to
warm
up
with
friends
on
a
winter
night
mouthfeel
begins
to
take
on
tobacco
notes
with
the
dark
almost
doppelbock
light
feel
to
it
remains
drinkable
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
with
a
negative
heavy
effect
thanks
to
rob
for
bringing
this
up
from
st
lous
i
am
not
normally
an
esb
fan
but
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
have
good
things
from
this
brewery
this
was
nice
and
fairly
straightforward
would
buy
again
overall
a
really
easy
drinker
from
schlafly
good
complexity
with
a
good
balance
d
higher
than
some
other
esb
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
glad
that
my
timing
was
right
to
catch
it
on
cask
drinkability
is
good
while
not
very
bitter
this
beer
is
very
tasty
the
aroma
is
very
mild
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
maybe
some
hops
it
has
a
hazy
brown
body
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
and
sediment
it
had
a
rocky
head
at
first
that
settled
nicely
and
quickly
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
it
has
a
bitter
taste
that
is
more
in
the
aftertaste
than
the
primary
flavoring
nice
malt
flavor
with
some
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
pretty
slick
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
i
know
its
not
carbonation
i
see
in
there
about
a
one
finger
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
rather
faint
hops
may
have
faded
a
bit
as
all
i
am
left
with
is
a
bit
of
spice
and
malt
taste
is
a
well
balanced
caramel
malt
with
a
nice
zesty
kick
of
spice
some
piney
hop
is
still
there
too
a
pleasant
light
creamy
mouthfeel
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
i
guess
the
spice
is
what
makes
it
a
winter
esb
as
it
is
summer
and
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
appearance
is
a
orangereally
light
copper
color
and
has
a
nice
white
head
that
has
nice
retention
leaves
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
the
smell
is
at
first
i
wasnt
impressed
but
after
smelling
it
a
few
more
times
it
smells
not
bad
hint
of
spices
kind
of
bready
taste
is
kind
of
bitter
but
wont
turn
you
away
from
this
beer
and
has
a
sweet
taste
to
it
as
well
not
very
hoppy
but
you
can
taste
them
sneaking
out
a
bit
really
dont
know
what
to
say
about
the
taste
of
this
one
but
all
i
can
say
is
its
not
bad
at
all
like
most
schlafly
beers
ive
had
its
not
amazing
but
its
not
bad
or
even
average
its
good
and
worth
trying
also
bottled
on
date
was
8
months
ago
dont
know
how
well
this
ages
but
i
would
like
to
have
tried
it
more
fresh
none
the
less
i
still
enjoyed
it
taste
is
similar
to
most
bitters
but
the
rye
element
adds
a
little
something
like
all
bitters
i
could
drink
and
enjoy
one
but
no
more
than
one
in
an
evening
d
quality
across
the
board
from
the
first
pour
to
the
last
sip
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
to
consume
i
consider
myself
a
fan
of
the
saint
louis
brewery
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
i
particularly
like
the
balance
in
the
ingredients
at
6
2
its
a
little
strong
to
be
considered
a
session
beer
but
the
drinkability
is
certainly
high
i
look
forward
to
picking
these
up
every
winter
drinkability
quite
drinkable
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
beer
didnt
discern
any
spices
but
that
may
have
faded
over
time
good
beer
but
i
also
have
trouble
with
esbs
because
i
really
enjoy
some
goose
island
harvest
ale
this
beer
was
served
a
burnt
orangecopper
slightly
hazy
there
is
a
nice
pillowy
white
one
finger
head
that
retains
well
nice
wispy
lacing
the
whole
way
down
nose
is
of
sweet
caramels
some
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
fantastic
malted
backbone
on
this
beer
gives
is
a
nice
strong
feel
pretty
full
bodied
there
are
definite
spices
and
hops
present
slightly
hoppier
than
i
anticipated
but
was
so
well
balanced
with
the
malts
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
smooth
with
a
good
kick
full
bodied
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
a
solid
but
kinda
forgetful
esb
as
it
warms
i
get
more
of
a
fruitiness
in
it
a
good
one
to
try
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
but
i
will
not
seek
out
for
it
and
would
pick
others
ahead
of
it
maybe
the
4
months
have
worn
out
the
hops
in
it
but
i
was
just
hoping
for
something
just
a
little
more
hoppy
conclusion
this
reminds
me
of
england
and
all
those
english
beers
i
was
something
of
a
novice
and
not
a
true
ba
at
that
time
that
i
couldnt
remember
the
names
of
once
i
got
home
but
the
impression
of
which
ill
never
forget
this
beer
is
like
a
trip
to
a
yorkshire
pub
classic
english
esb
i
know
this
is
utter
blasphemy
but
i
like
it
better
than
fullers
by
a
wide
margin
pours
a
clear
amber
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
grass
slight
fruit
and
a
hint
of
spice
fits
the
style
of
an
extra
special
bitter
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
low
carbonation
level
bitterness
in
noticeable
tastes
of
sweet
malt
up
front
then
strong
grass
flavors
then
there
are
nice
floral
hops
with
a
slight
fruit
finish
overall
well
balanced
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
full
on
the
palate
easy
to
drink
to
a
fault
when
i
had
this
i
felt
that
it
smelled
and
tasted
somewhat
like
schlaflys
kolsch
just
a
tad
maltier
and
darker
in
color
i
dont
think
thats
too
far
off
i
expected
some
spice
and
malt
heft
with
the
moniker
winter
preceding
esb
the
esb
part
i
get
and
it
isnt
bad
the
winter
part
mystifies
and
disappoints
me
id
beef
up
the
malt
and
spice
considerably
that
would
get
it
rocking
as
it
stands
its
just
ok
dnice
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
ill
look
forward
to
grabbing
a
6
of
at
least
once
a
year
mouth
is
medium
and
smooth
crisp
highly
drinkable
just
a
very
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
standby
session
brews
when
available
i
can
easily
put
back
a
few
and
not
get
tired
of
it
too
bad
the
abv
isnt
posted
dvery
hoppy
and
flowery
slow
drinker
drinks
easy
enough
nice
intro
to
the
style
d
this
beer
is
a
great
session
beer
one
can
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
get
tired
of
it
very
enjoyable
no
fancy
labels
no
clever
names
just
good
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
to
look
at
and
smell
its
nothing
special
but
once
in
the
mouth
its
not
bad
d
this
is
a
decent
esb
and
very
sessionable
another
fine
beer
from
schlafly
pours
a
bright
copper
with
some
light
golden
accents
around
the
edge
the
bone
colored
cap
is
light
and
fluffy
and
leaves
some
nice
even
lacing
marking
my
pace
with
each
sip
the
nose
is
rye
bread
lightly
toasted
and
butterywith
some
light
hoppy
esters
the
flavor
profile
is
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
had
expectednor
that
flavorful
either
it
is
good
and
not
offensive
in
any
manor
of
the
wordi
just
expected
something
a
little
bolder
in
flavor
subtle
caramel
and
rye
offset
one
another
in
a
sweet
and
salty
sort
of
way
not
a
lot
of
hopbut
just
a
touch
of
citrus
keeps
this
interesting
an
odd
subtle
spinach
tang
on
the
finish
is
unique
and
enjoyablesomething
ive
never
tasted
before
in
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
course
at
the
same
time
and
is
really
where
i
think
this
deserves
its
highest
marks
not
what
i
expectedyet
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
definately
a
beer
that
can
be
imbibed
on
a
regular
basis
although
i
would
hesitate
to
drink
to
many
in
one
night

on

loved
drinking
this
during

winters
its
not
the
same
in
the
hot
desert
of
southern

but
it
does
bring
back
friendly
memories
a
great
drink
id
have
another
anytime

very
alluring
ale
nice
nod
to
the
english
flavor
i
could
enjoy
one
after
another
prosit
mk
tasted
on
3908
this
was
a
comfortable
beer
with
a
good
marriage
of
the
hops
and
malt
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink

up
for

expected
a

i
was
certainly
not

this
would
make

pours
an

color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
citrusy
hops
toasted
malt
honey
and
grainbread
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
pine
and
butterscotch
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
slightly
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
good
mixture
of
bitter
and
sweet
and
decent
balance
too
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
allaround
beer
id
buy
schlafly
products
more
often
too
bad
they
dont
distribute
to
ohio
yet
all
in
all
a
good
beer
to
have
a
light
amber
color
with
slight
signs
of
carbonation
in
the
glass
a
small
white
head
forms
but
quickly
dissolves
away
a
cracked
roasted
fragrance
of
barley
comes
out
at
first
that
is
followed
by
bread
and
biscuity
scents
anf
finishing
off
with
light
cirusy
and
pine
fragrances
the
taste
starts
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
then
halfway
across
the
palate
a
mild
citrus
bitterness
takes
over
but
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
a
medium
bodied
feel
at
the
start
and
gains
weight
as
it
crosses
the
palate
finishing
much
heavier
than
one
would
expect
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
strong
qualities
in
a
bitter
which
makes
this
an
excellent
selection
as
session
beer
it
isnt
the
most
exciting
brew
but
its
really
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
one
of
those
that
you
could
enjoy
all
night
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
drinkable
esb
sessionale
that
would
be
enjoyable
sitting
by
the
fire
or
watching
a
bowlplayoff
game
d
a
very
average
and
uninspired
brew
imo
nothing
really
wrong
with
that
but
i
dont
really
see
why
its
considered
a
christmas
beer
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
has
a
hoppy
scent
to
it
with
malt
undertoes
taste
is
really
damn
good
has
a
pleasent
mixture
of
bitterness
as
well
as
a
sweet
maltiness

it
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
drinkability
is
high

very

i
like
this
beer
its
very
sessionable
and
quite
enjoyable
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
flavors
but
not
much
depth
this
is
a
nice
esp
that
is
very
drinkable
and
there
is
no
palate
fatigue
even
after
a
few
pints
d
of
the
ones
ive
been
able
to
sample
from
this
brewery
this
is
my
favorite
found
a
sixpack
of
this
at
a
schnucksst
louis
based
grocery
in
evansville
bottled
dec

2006
according
to
a
stamp
on
the
label
pours
a
lightly
hazed
amber
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
very
good
retention
with
some
spotty
lacing
on
the

aroma
is
toasty
malts
citrusy
and
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
spicy
rye
medium
carbonation
supports
the
light
medium
body
taste
is
ruled
by
a
floral
hop
bitterness
that
is
complimented
by
toasty
toffee
maltiness
some
citrus
and
a
welcome
bite
of
spicy
rye
nice
not
exactly
an
english
style
esb
but
very
nicely
done
and
highly
drinkable
id
definitely
have
this
again
and
several
if
possible
but
evidently
not
until
late
fall
bummer
this
was
a
good
beer
although
i
struggle
to
call
it
either
a
winter
beer
or
a
bitter
im
not
sure
what
makes
winter
esb
a
winter
esb
other
than
the
fact
that
it
was
brewed
in
late
october
and
was
released
in
time
for
the
season
i
was
waiting
for
a
hoptastic
ryefilled
experience
that
never
really
materialized
adding
twice
as
many
hops
and
twice
as
much
rye
would
be
a
great
place
to
start
and
would
turn
this
beer
into
something
to
be
reckoned
with
thanks
jpm30
d
the
bitter
roastiness
of
this
beer
might
prevent
it
from
being
an
allday
drinker
but
i
could
easily
put
back
a
few
of
these
quite
a
nice
beer
d
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
good
beer
better
than
most
american
attemps
at
this
english
classic
style
the
beer
begins
with
moderate
yet
pronounced
bready
maltysweet
lightly
syrup
aromas
and
flavors
soon
followed
up
with
a
light
nutty
character
soon
giving
way
to
solid
but
not
overbearing
piney
hops
hops
offset
the
malts
well
while
contributing
a
defined
bitterness
that
cleanses
the
palate
and
contributes
a
light
dryness
though
moderate
flavors
the
body
seems
to
fall
apart
a
little
too
quickly
leaving
a
sticky
feel
and
a
colalike
finish
though
a
bit
less
than
clean
in
the
end
its
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
bottles
with
love

mouthfeel

bodied
with
zesty

i
will
return
to
this
one
thanks
jpm30
for
this
wonderful
example
of
an
american
esb
edit
as
beer
warms
taste
of
alcohol
is
definitely
present
still
stick
by
my
initial
review
this
esb
poured
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
creamy
foam
with
a
hint
of
yellow
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
there
was
good
carbonation
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
biscuity
malty
the
taste
was
good
and
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
grain
in
the
malt
flavors
and
a
hint
of
tangy
sweetness
almost
like
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
coarse
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
moderate
hoppiness
persisted
in
the
finish
together
with
a
light
biscuity
malt
this
was
a
decently
drinkable
esb
though
not
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
ontap
12
oz
bottle
pured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
massive
chunky
off
white
head
had
to
wait
a
moment
for
the
head
to
go
down
to
finish
the
pour
head
receded
to
a
light
lace
clear
amber
color
sweet
malt
smell
with
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
taste
is
mildly
bitter
mostly
in
the
back
a
little
floral
mouthfeel
is
very
mild
no
real
carbonation
bite
more
of
a
creaminess
this
is
a
nicely
refreshing
beer
it
doesnt
really
seem
like
a
winter
beer
to
me
though
this
beer
makes
the
grade
a
nice
amber
hue
from
the
bottle
with
an
off
white
head
that
caps
the
beer
and
a
thin
lace
that
follows
the
beer
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
faint
a
bit
metallic
sugary
plums
sweet
brown
sugarcocoa
an
interesting
aroma
for
this
beer
the
taste
still
has
the
powdery
sweet
malt
flavoring
the
copper
metallic
is
still
present
in
the
aftertaste
but
there
is
an
endearing
presence
of
full
malts
and
some
light
hops
the
finish
is
where
this
one
dissapoints
there
is
nothing
there
watery
and
bland
the
finish
is
distant
this
one
is
decent
at
best
my
first
from
schlafly
it
is
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
the
age
has
to
be
a
factor
here
cellared
at
around
65
degrees
and
subject
to
constantc
light
i
am
sure
that
it
had
been
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
if
i
could
find
more
schlafly
in
ne
i
would
definately
drink
more
schlafly
in
ne
its
probably
a
little
heavy
on
the
rye
to
make
it
a
quaffer
but
then
it
is
a
winter
beer
meant
to
be
sipped
on
cold
nights
for
what
it
is
it
would
seem
to
work
perfectly
while
i
couldnt
kill
a
sixer
in
a
sitting
id
pony
up
for
this
one
again
another
good
beer
from
schlafly
pours
an
amber
color
with
some
ruby
and
golden
hues
fluffy
cream
colored

that
rises

smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
sweetness
taste
is
very
balanced
the
hops
nor
malts
are
overpowering
its
sweet
yet
nicely
bitter
feels
good
in
the
mouth
its
a
very
filling
beer
the
most
drinkable
esb
ive
had
this
is
a
fine
offering
from
schlafly
one
of
the
best
esbs
that
ive
had
and
i
have
dertbert
to
thank
for
it
thanks
for
the
esb
markjr
the
beer
poured
with
minimal
head
the
color
is
a
light
reddish
amber
the
smell
is
fairly
bitter
the
taste
reveals
hops
lots
of
em
as
far
as
esbs
go
this
is
among
the
better
ones
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
any
harshness
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
with
one
exception
this
is
the
last
one
i
got
without
driving
to
st
louis
i
could
drink
more
if
they
were
more
readilly
available
i
would
like
to
explore
this
brewer
better
full
bodied
and
smooth
very
drinkable
great
alternative
after
being
disappointed
with
the
ipa
this
beer
is
a
very
clear
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
in
the
form
of
caramel
and
just
a
little
apple
the
flavor
is
light
caramel
apple
and
just
a
little
tangy
citrus
to
wake
up
the
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
slick
but
rich
and
it
is
very
drinkable
nice
interpretation
of
this
style
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
medium
although
labeled
as
a
winter
esb

makes
a
nice
summer
session

well

the

pulled
through

the

eased
on

this
is
best
one
this
brewery
has
to
offer
o
tried
quite
a
few
of
their
beers
in
the
3
visits
i
made
to
the
pubs
this
definitely
stuck
out
something
that
anyone
could
enjoy
something
with
some
memorable
character
this
isnt
going
to
blow
you
away
flavorwise
but
its
definitely
flavored
enough
and
the
cask
conditioning
nicely
melds
the
flavor
here
and
just
gives
this
an
all
around
kickass
drinkability
id
always
be
good
for
a
pint
of
this
if
i
saw
it
here
on
cask
nice
stuff
o
good
but
not
great
pretty
decent
and
likely
a
bit
of
homer
in
my
grading
as
deschutes
is
one
of
my
favorites
o
not
as
hop
forward
or
bitter
as
i
remember
but
still
a
tasty
maltforward
beer
i
dont
quite
know
how
it
holds
the
line
to
the
style
though
what
we
have
here
seemingly
is
a
decent
amber
ale
it
needs
a
fair
bit
more
biscuit
edge
and
noble
hop
bitterness
to
slide
into
the
esb
zone
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
enjoy
many
of
in
one
sitting

head
in
length
the
head
is
slightly
off
white
but
just
barely
mostly
big
bubbles
in
the
head
but
there
are
a
fair
amount
of
small
bubbles
underneath
that
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
head
isnt
hanging
around
too
long
but
its
not
going
away
completely
something
that
i
have
found
common
in
deschutes
beers
the
body
is
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
very
little
visibility
through
this
beer
the
color
is
unique
a
little
dark
for
the
style
but
i
dont
really
care
the
carbonation
looks
just
about
right
overall
the
look
is
pretty
impressive
on
the
smell
its
pretty
malt
based
very
small
hop
note
in
there
but
that
works
for
the
style
does
it
smell
good
yeah
great
not
at
all
pretty
standard
you
can
tell
the
malts
will
taste
good
but
still
not
an
amazing
smell
maybe
its
just
the
style
im
not
a
fan
of
but
the
smell
is
only
ok
for
me
i
expect
this
to
be
a
solid
beer
just
not
my
thing
but
ill
give
it
a
fair
chance
yeah
not
my
kind
of
beer
here
i
have
had
better
esbs
though
so
im
a
little
confused
here
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
too
great
either
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
prominent
in
this
beer
for
only
5
3
the
hops
are
very
minute
and
the
malt
is
just
not
the
type
i
like
all
over
its
just
not
very
balanced
and
its
kinda
all
over
the
place
the
alcohol
is
probably
the
most
dominant
factor
really
which
is
never
good
then
after
the
alcohol
its
just
a
random
mixture
of
malts
and
small
hops
im
trying
to
rate
this
beer
in
terms
of
the
style
and
i
think
that
its
just
messing
with
my
head
as
far
as
a
beer
goes
its
just
not
that
great
for
me
a
little
sour
which
is
unwanted
and
the
carbonation
adds
to
the
weirdness
despite
all
these
flavors
it
does
have
some
watery
characteristics
to
it
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
mix
between
a
scotch
ale
and
a
ipa
its
a
very
weird
beer
and
perhaps
its
just
the
style
but
like
i
said
i
have
had
better
esbs
so
i
dunno
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
big
enough
to
support
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
right
drinkability
is
ok
but
these
weird
flavors
for
sure
dont
help
overall
im
very
confused
with
this
beer
and
im
sure
im
just
over
thinking
things
and
confusing
myself
but
only
to
some
extent
its
a
very
weird
beer
with
all
that
being
said
its
still
not
a
terrible
beer
id
drink
it
again
but
only
if
nothing
else
was
available
strange
beer
the
aroma
was
light
lots
of
grain
and
light
spice
with
a
smooth
mellow
and
light
fruity
hint
that
popped
up
toward
the
finish
smooth
mellow
flavor
with
a
n
even
cosistency
my
only
knock
is
it
came
off
as
more
of
a
mild
ale
to
me
as
the
hop
flavor
was
not
really
too
high
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitter
flavor
easily
drinkable
though
as
no
real
heavy
feeling
or
flavor
another
addition
from
one
of
the
old
notebooks
brought
back
to
us
from
oregon
by
my
exwifes
uncle
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
little
light
tan
head
aromas
of
light
hops
sweet
malt
and
caramel
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
citric
hops
caramel
and
sweet
malt
o
im
dissapointed
i
have
to
say
deschutes
normally
crafts
devine
brews
but
this
comes
up
short
its
above
average
but
not
to
the
level
i
expect
from
deschutes
i
love
a
good
esb
too
it
may
be
my
favorite
style
needs
a
little
punching
up
since
i
cant
find
this
locally
and
there
are
some
other
good
local
esbs
around
it
might
not
be
a
bad
thing
drinkability
is
great
while
i
might
be
a
huge
fan
for
this
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
an
entire
session
had
this
on
tap
at
the
deschutes
brewpub
in
portland
pours
a
copper
colour
with
thin
white
head
leaving
small
patches
of
lacing
smells
of
earthy
hops
and
caramel
malt
flavour
has
very
mild
bitterness
nice
carbonation
level
on
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
no
where
near
the
level
of
many
of
the
other
beers
on
tap
at
deschutes
for
some
reason
these
arent
distributed
as
much
as
they
used
to
be
probably
the
most
drank
esb
in
my
lifetime
anderson
valley
close
second
id
guess
pours
a
moderate
orangecopper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
has
some
light
malt
as
well
as
some
floral
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
with
the
mouthfeel
surrendering
to
a
bit
of
bitterness
drinks
quite
well
and
this
would
be
one
nice
brew
to
have
locally
very
drinkable
and
very
good
overall
d
overall
a
very
well
balanced
beer
very
good
do
they
make
married
man
desb
do
they
even
make
double
esbs
regardless
this
brew
pours
a
mostly
clear
reddishamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
flowers
light
orange
peel
and
light
slightly
blackened
biscuits
they
were
only
left
in
the
oven
a
few
seconds
too
long
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
the
bitterness
mostly
from
citrus
hops
eliciting
a
sensation
of
orange
peel
is
stepped
up
to
a
greater
degree
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
wet
feel
overall
a
nice
esb
that
lives
up
to
its
third
letter
bachelor
esb
poured
an
impressive
dark
amber
with
significant
red
undertones
from
the
bottle
that
i
purchased
at
a
local
portland
store
the
head
was
modest
but
present
with
good
lacing
i
was
somewhat
less
drawn
to
the
scent
of
this
one
when
compared
to
many
of
the
other
reviewers
it
seemed
a
bit
flat
for
my
tastes
with
an
acetic
lemon
smell
accompanied
by
faint
pine
and
other
resins
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
much
more
rewarding
with
a
bold
yet
balanced
carbonation
and
predominant
flavors
of
grapefruit
dry
herbs
and
malts
d
very
good
drinkability
at
5

this
is
a
nice
beer
to
go
through
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
will
definitely
get
again
d
a
worthy
offering
from
deschutes
but
not
my
favorite
by
far
pleasant
citrus
and
floral
aromas
fairly
thin
in
the
mouth
not
overly
carbonated
some
distinct
malty
bite
at
first
this
quickly
faded
into
a
deceptively
watery
finish
that
expanded
into
a
lingering
grapefruity
bitterness
pretty
drinkable
although
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
might
grow
to
be
a
bit
much
after
a
pint
or
so
one

with
a

on

end

is
a
bit
thin
decent
effervescence
really
drinkable
at
this
abv
very
sessionable
tasty
worth
a
try
another
winner
from
deschutes
md
the
taste
doesnt
cloy
or
stick
to
your
mouth
it
goes
down
well
and
stays
like
that
the
drinkability
is
above
average
perhaps
its
just
the
style
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
more
kick
to
the
hop
taste
drinkability
this
is
a
solid
beer

im
really
enjoying

wouldnt

classic
english

doesnt
try
to
be

its
not
i
e
stray
from
the
malthop
balance
in
a
context
of
2010
or
2009
where
hoppiness
seems
to
be
a
primary
virtue
this
brew
may
not
measure
up
its
not
exciting
but
in
a
context
of
perfect
hopmalt
balance
this
offering
from
deschutes
is
near
perfection
easy
to

very
easy
to
enjoy
i
could
drink
it
all
springsummerfall
d
emphasis
on

the

lowers
the
drinkability
for
me

a
decent
to
good
esb
overall
impression
well
balanced
sessionable
and
enjoyable
esb
a
more
tannic
version
of
a
british
style
esb
but
with
the
same
mellow
hop
flavor
expected
drinks
well
with
a
long
finish
great
for
conversation
with
the
out
of
town
guy
sitting
next
to
me
poor
sap
lives
in
north
carolina
this
is
the
last
of
deschutes
year
round
ales
for
me
to
review
their
consistency
and
value
are
extraordinary
well
done
again
a
brew
i
often
overlook
in
deschutes
lineup
but
im
awful
glad
i
grabbed
a
sixer
of
worth
going
back
for
more
this
is
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
wellbalanced
hoppy
with
a
firm
malt
backbone
english
character
in
aroma
and
taste
an
enjoyable
brew
nice

a
small
amount
of
head
smells
of
bread
slightly
piny
hop
scent
malts
tastes
bready

a
nice

hops
are
more
piney
than
citrus
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
amount

this
is
a
decent
beer
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
deschutes
stuff
ive
had
but
not
bad
d
very
drinkable
a
great
representation
of
an

lingering
bitterness
poured
into
12oz
glass
poured
with
about
an
inch
of
khaki
colored
head
made
of
lots
of
tight
tiny
bubbles
the
head
lingered
leaving
good
sticky
lacing
a
pretty
dark
orangelight
brown
color
very
nice

foundation
in
the
aroma
with

hint
of

a
smooth

with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bittering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
great
body
smooth
balanced
and
full
wonderfully
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
companion
for
whatever
youre
doing
on
an
afternoon
the
moderate
alcohol
will
not
make
you
foggy
so
you
can
concentrate
on
your
other
pleasure
d
good
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
but
a
bit
monotone
and
lacking
complexity
in
flavor
department
d
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
beer
no
big
powerful
flavors
to
make
this
difficult
just
a
nice
esb
a
little
light
bodied
for
my
tastes
but
it
has
good
mild
hoppiness
combined
with
a
nice
malt
body
true
to
style
this
extra
special
bitter
makes
for
a
great
semisession
beer
share
a
pitcher
with
a
friend
if
you
can
find
it
on
draft
or
order
a
few
pints
for
yourself
deschutes
delivers
again
despite
my
misscue
on
the
pour
mouthfeel
is
fine
with
a
certain
crispness
from
the
hop
bitterness
drinkability
is
good
due
in
part
to
the
relatively
low
abv
of
5
3
somewhat
hard
to
find
unless
your
beer
store
carries
the
full
line
of
deschutes
standard
beers
well
recommended
d
this
is
the
first
of
these
that
ive
had
and
im
quite
a
fan
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
and
ringing
in
at
5
2
makes
for
an
even
better
session
great
beer
drinkability
my
oh
my
what
a
great
beer
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
been
blessed
to
enjoy
from
the
same
brewery
my
first
was
their
porter
and
this
is
a
beer
that
reminds
me
of
how
well
an
american
brewery
can
interpret
an
english
esb
if
they
want
to
no
expense
was
spared
in
this
one
nice
job
folks
really
good
clean
esb
also
pairs
well
with
food
dark
gold
with
little
head
this
cask
version
really
shows
off
the
malt
in
the
finish
the
hops
seem
to
move
to
the
back
ground
compared
to
the
bottled
version
i
like
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
smoothness
to
the
finish
tastes
a
lot
like
a
more
english
esb
juicy
mango
and
citrus
notes
hit
the
front
of
the
palate
followed
by
fresh
resinous
hops
and
a
mineral
crispness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
at
first
but
the
hop
bitterness
that
rides
the
back
of
the
tongue
makes
up
for
it
all
in
all
this
wasnt
bad
but
id
be
keen
to
reach
for
other
deschutes
brews

the
taste
is
incredibly

an
extremely
well
crafted
beer
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
if
was
available
here
in
fl
overall
bachelor
esb
is
another
outstanding
brew
from
deschutes
quickly
moving
up
my
list
of
favorite
breweries
highly
recommended
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
very
light
brown
head
smells
mildly
of
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
pine
tastes
of
malt
a
little
bit
of
herb
and
a
solid
coppery
bitterness
with
some
citrus
as
well
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
carbonation
was
about
right
for
my
tastes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
ive
had
poured
a
second
if
id
had
one
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
nice
sweet
bitter
balance
a
malty
caramelly
body
and
flowery
citrusy
hops
deschutes
makes
some
quality
brew
and
this
is
no
exception
its
tough
to
find
good
american
esbs
but
this
fits
the
bill
thanks
again
for
the
sample

drained
into
a
glass
to
yield
a
roasted
mahogany
hue
with
one
fingers
width
of

foamed
head
good
retention
with
some
lacing
a
beautiful
brew
indeed
with
an
aroma
of
bready
warmth
and
spicy
hops
the
smooth
and
luxurious
mouthfeel
offers
some
sweetness
making
way
for
a
bitter
and
slightly
tangy
finish
delish
great
one
to
have
on
cask
still
very
sessionable
i
remember
this
having
a
bit
more
fruittyness
but
a
super
solid
esb
that
rivals
many
brewed
across
the
pond
imo
drinkablity
one
of
the
best
standard
issue
deschutes
brews
i
have
had
i
will
buy
this
again
the
taste
was
a
maltiness
up
front
and
some
fruitiness
from
a
hopness
the
bitterness
stays
in
the
mouth
a
long
time
and
the
malt
hits
the
mark
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
overall
a
solid
brew
and
one
that
is
mellow
but
complex
and
is
very
true
to
fullers
style
one
of
my
first
trips
into
the
esb
realm
in
quite
a
while
wow
what
a
great
beer
i
had
forgotten
how
good
an
esb
could
be
this
is
one
my
all
time
favorites
bitter
like
an
ipa
but
a
little
more
smooth

color
a
lighter

bit
more
fizzy
than
i
would
like
to
see
but
not

make
this
a
very
sessionable
brew
one
that
could
easily
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
bachelor

another
stablemate
of
standard
brews
in
my
fridge
you
can
get
it

a
very
good

game
of
the
year
as
previous
ba
did
pours
a
rich
amber
hue
with
a
nice
one
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
lacing
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
smell
is
pretty
damn
citrusy
for
this
style
you
can
tell
its
a
west
coast
brewery
under
the
initial
hoppy
burst
follows
a
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
is
amazing
such
a
complete
balance
all
around
the
caramel
malt
is
more
present
on
the
tongue
than
i
had
expected
after
giving
this
one
a
whiff
starts
off
sweet
but
not
bitter
towards
the
end
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
dryness
emerges
leaving
a
somewhat
citrus
like
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
pretty
creamy
overall
at

abv
i
could
easily
put
these
away
one
after
another
drinkability
a
very
well
balanced
brew
that
i
really
enjoy
goes
well
with
almost
anything
and
always
goes
down
smooth
not
what
i
really
expected
in
an
esb
the
color
of
it
when
poured
was
an
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
the
smell
of
hops
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
fruity
was
just
sitting
there
when
poured
it
had
very
little
foam
and
while
drinking
no
lace
what
so
ever
the
taste
was
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
bitter
hoppy
flavor
with
not
spice
or
fruit
flavor
that
was
evident
i
really
expect
more
out
of
the
esb
a
little
dissapointed
but
i
guess
thats
how
it
goes
rich
amber
color
with
a
good
head
of
white
suds
mostly
clear
with
a
filtered
polish
smell
was
gently
malty
and
fruity
with
a
good
measure
of
bright
floral
hops
though
not
as
much
hop
aroma
as
youd
expect
form
a
pale
or
ipa
the
bittering
was
nicely
balanced
and
allowd
this
beer
to
hold
onto
a
lingering
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
pretty
normal
not
really
too
chewy
i
drank
three
bottles
and
enjoyed
all
of
them
from
start
to
finish
so
id
say
the
drinkability
is
ideal

with

would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
a
very
nice
esb
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
the
mouthfeel
for
me
is
spot
on
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
esb
and
im
glad
that
its
back
in
town
after
being
absent
for
many
years
im
just
hoping
that
i
can
get
some
fresher

a

citrus

sweet

a
nice
subtle

not
at

solid
take
on

has
the

hops
to
make
for
a
good
couple
of

i
find
the

just
an
allround

you
could
make

out
of
it

esb
orange
aroma
with
a
splash
of
hop
bitterness
nothing
overly
lively
or
present
pleasant
but
slightly
timid
more
assertiveness
on
the
mouthfeel
an
interrupting
bitterness
upfront
might
interrupt
the
flavour
except
there
isnt
much
very
aggressive
bitterness
that
abrupts
the
drinkablility
no
need
for
such
hops
the
malt
is
nice
i
wish
it
was
showcased
a
little
more
i
think
for
this
style
my
first
choice
would
be
the
british
brewer
i
think
this
could
be
more
if
tried
to
be
less
the
smell
is
somewhat
light
but
nice
and
full
of
biscuit
and
malt
flavor
the
taste
is
classic
and
bold
while
giving
way
to
a
substantial
hop
flavor
in
the
end
its
solid
in
the
mouth
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
wellcrafted
and
nicely
balanced
a
great
session
beer
very
bitter
and
some
malting
in
finish
grapefruit
chop
aroma
golden
with
white
head
consumed
three
days
past
expiration
date
more
bitter
than
i
would
like
so
not
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
some
citrus
dry
aftertaste
was
not
what
it
could
be
with
food
quite
median
brew
notes
ehhhh
its
above
average
for
the
style
but
from
deshutes
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
to
be
fair
its
a
decent
brew
that
is
without
a
doubt
is
reccomended
i
would
pass
this
to
someone
trying
a
esb
for
the
first
time
without
hesitation
but
nothing
for
me
to
get
overly
excited
about
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
perhaps
the
best
deschutes
product
i
have
tried
ill
be
looking
for
more
bachelor
esb
pop
the
cap
and
witness
a
pour
that
results
in
an
inch
thick
head
and
copper
body
nose
is
full
of
caramel
and
extremely
mild
grapefruit
hops
lacing
follows
the
progress
of
the
consumption
taste
is
caramel
up
front
grapefruit
and
pine
mouth
is
a
pleasing
full
body
yep
this
could
be
consumed
over
and
over
a
winner
for
deschutes
who
have
continued
to
kick
ass
moreso
as
time
rolls
on
props
to
you
deschutes
please
keep
giving
us
in
the
northwest
the
brews
we
dream
of
clear
amberdark
copper
color
with
pillowy
head
that
has
great
retention
and
kept
a
nice
thin
foam
layer
the
whole
time
smell
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
good
earthy
hop
aroma
medium
body
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
great
deep
hoppy
bitterness
all
over
taste
is
well
balanced
between
a
great
malty
character
and
serious
bitterering
aftertaste
is
awesome
after
each
drink
you
can
keep
on
enjoying
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
i
will
have
another
now
quite
a
nice
mouthfeel
making
this
a
very
nice
brew
more
of
a
wintery
one
or
one
for
accompanying
food
than
a
summer
cooler
drinkablity
go
give
this
a
shot
as
your
session
beer
i
think
the
variety
of
flavors
achieved
in
this
brew
will
give
even
a
seasoned
palate
a
run
for
their
money
the
beer
poured
copper
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dissapeared
about
half
way
through
the
beer
so
it
retained
fairly
well
the
head
left
fine
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
pour
the
nose
was
a
doughy
malt
character
with
some
citrus
as
well
the
taste
was
super
balanced
caramel
and
floral
hops
the
beer
just
bettered
as
it
warmed
and
ill
admit
to
finishing
one
from
this
six
pack
earlier
in
the
week
at
room
temperature
a
medium
bodied
but
full
flavored
brew
that
is
super
drinkable
overall
a
great
treat
to
have
a
friend
bring
me
this
one
from
the
northwest
really
a
fantastic
esb
that
drinks
easily
while
still
being
really
interesting
drinkability
a
very
well
done
esb
super
easy
to
drink
could
use
a
touch
more
bitterness
though
drinkability
as
i
said
i
couldnt
put
this
one
down
and
could
have
another
right
away
superb
beer
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
fine
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
also
has
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
that
refreshes
and
balances
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
is
light
but
full
flavored
it
has
a
floral
hop
flavor
that
adds
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
nothing
over
the
top
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
esb
it
is
well
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
a
good
drinker
thanks
to
my
stepcousin
who
is
now
a
brewer
at
deschutes
for
bringing
me
this
fine
brew
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
nice
fluffy
two
finger
head
that
settles
nicely
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacebig
aromas
going
on
some
dry
biscuit
malt
with
a
little
caramel
and
big
juicy
citrus
to
balance
i
even
get
some
metallic
in
there
very
solid
brew
hoppier
than
say
a
true
english
esb
but
there
is
a
firm
lightly
sweet
maltiness
and
nuttiness
that
keeps
it
pretty
well
balanced
a
real
nice
beer
well
rounded
and
very
flavorful
my
first
ale
from
deschutes
was
pretty
darn
good
medium
bodied
good
session
beer
quite
drinkable
doesnt
wear
out
your
tastebuds
a
nice
sweet
assertive
carmel
taste
on
the
first
sip
leadsd
nicely
into
the
firm
hop
taste
and
bite
the
medium
body
of
the
beer
adds
to
the
flavor
and
charcter
profile
of
this
beer
a
true
winner
in
my
fridge
bachelor
esb
is
clear
deep
bronze
has
a
sudsy
head
and
is
wellbalanced
and
easy
to
drink
it
is
suited
to
popular
tastes
for
all
the
best
reasons
im
sure
ive
said
it
before
but
ill
just
have
to
risk
repeating
myself
deschutes
brews
very
good
beer
bachelor
esb
doesnt
beat
out
brutal
bitter
for
top
esb
in
my
book
but
it
wins
the
silver
medal
quite
comfortably
mmmm
a
fine
esb
from
one
of
the
nations
finest
breweries
it
pours
a
rich
glowing
amber
with
large
fluffy
head
and
tons
of
beautiful
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
malts
and
a
light
hop
twinge
the
beer
is
hugely
flavorful
with
lots
of
strong
tasty
malts
and
a
crisp
hoppiness
that
is
just
about
perfectly
balanced
both
elements
are
forceful
but
that
is
the
northwest
way
the
malts
put
forth
bready
flavors
that
are
reminiscent
of
english
ales
but
a
bit
more
in
your
face
hops
linger
on
the
tongue
for
a
great
aftertaste
mouthfeel
perfectly
soft
and
smooth
the
beer
is
nourishing
and
very
drinkable
a
success
on
every
level
and
yet
another
example
of
deschutes
brewing
prowess
the
copper
with
a
slight
haze
is
topped
by
a
soupy
white
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
light
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
mostly
the
malt
the
caramel
again
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
hops
just
peek
around
the
edges
of
the
malt
but
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
pours
dark
amber
with
some
orange
tint
thick
fine
white
head

down
to

counters
into

and
some
fruity
sweetness
as
well

is
superb
aftertaste
is
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
some
moderate
lacing
very
good
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
but
rather
unexciting
making
it
a
bit
boring
for
my
tastes
pours
a
hazed
copper
and
burnt
orange
with
a
very
nice
frothy
creamcolored
head
with
a
mix
of
small
dense
areas
and
large
massive
bubbles
making
it
obvious
this
one
has
body
the
smell
consists
of
nice
caramel
floral
and
citrus
hops
biscuity
malt
and
a
dry
bitterness
the
taste
consists
of
a
hop
bite
with
smooth
toasty
malts
and
caramel
with
some
citrus
notes
tapering
into
a
thin
but
dry
finish
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
it
finshes
slightly
dry
this
is
a
nice
brew
however
this
one
did
not
make
me
crave
another
maybe
too
satisfying
or
it
becomes
less
complex
as
i
work
my
way
through
still
good
cheers
very
drinkable
unless
one
cant
stand
any
kind
of
bitterness
i
enjoyed
the
piney
dimension
to
this
esb
and
think
its
a
nice
change
of
pace

and
syrupy
and
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
mild
up
until
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
its
not
bad
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
fairly
drinkable
but
more
due
to
its
lack
of
offensiveness
than
a
real
desire
to
drink
it

over

biscuity
malt
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
its
quite
creamy
in
the
mouth
no
doubt
due
in
part
to
its
very
fine
and
moderate

the
flavor
is
as
the
aroma
suggests
it
may
be
with
a
dryish

thats
laced
with
fruitiness
soft

some
cherry

infused

it

ushers
in
a
dry

that
lingers
shortly
with
a
dollop
of
gently
caramelish
malt
quite
nice
and
surprisingly
authentic
english
in
character
a
flavorful
beer
that
doesnt
step
over

thus
retains
a
great

like
the
style
and
wish
more
were
brewed
and
easily
available
i
am
really
impressed
with
deschutes
and
the
consistency
that
they
display
in
their
overall
production
of
quality
beers
a
decent
beer
but
lacked
some
flavor
for
my
tastes
the
beer
looks
awesome
in
the
glass
with
its
copper
color
with
some
reddish
tones
smells
fruity
with
bready
grain
aromas
for
an
esb
i
thought
it
was
lacking
in
the
malt
department
and
wasnt
all
that
bitter
carbonation
was
high
maybe
this
was
detracting
from
the
flavor
of
the
beer
copper
in
color
with
minimal
head
nice
huskyoily
hop
nose
along
with
some
caramel
malt
tones
in
the
aroma
i
also
get
some
alcohol
on
the
nose
too
taste
is
pretty
good
that
huskyoily
hop
bite
emerges
but
there
is
a
good
malt
back
bone
here
a
quality
esb
with
some
above
average
bitterness
notes
very
flavourful
quite
impressive
i
must
say
this
is
a
great
ale
it
goes
great
with
marinated
grilled
flank
steak
the
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
chill
haze
is
barely
evident
but
there
nonetheless
this
beer
has
a
nice
little
hop
boquet
fruity
and
floral
theres
some
bitter
tones
here
but
they
dont
blow
me
away
fruity
esters
present
and
some
sweet
caramel
malt
backing
or
so
it
seems
body
is
medium
finish
is
somewhat
dry
but
o
k
another
great
deschutes
beer
nice
amber
color
and
lasting
head
like
the
other
deschutes
brew
this
one
has
a
strong
maltiness
with
a
fine
hop
flavor
balance
quite
enjoyable
im
smelling
a
spicey
concoction
of
hop
and
clover
rich
and
complex
malty
body
with
a
good
kick
of
bitters
definate
clover
notes
intermingle
with
your
palate
another
great
beer
by
deschutes
enjoy
ill
have
another
good
taste
smell
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
cheapest
ales
out
there
in
my
area
will
certainly
be
buying
more
of
this
average
beer
without
any
special
features
an
awesome
brew
to
have
off
cask
appearance
stylish
bottle
coppercolored
translucent
oily
liquid
good
training
dense
full
bodied
foam
aroma
excuse
me
but
i
felt
nothing
taste
hop
bitterness
wood
reminded
me
whiskey
alcohol
is
properly
inserted
leaving
the
taste
for
hops
very
nice
bitter
i
just
love
english
beer
so
i
might
be
a
bit
prejudiced
lovely
malty
brew
deep
color
smooth
malt
with
enough
hops
to
make
it
what
its
supposed
to
be
ive
bought
up
all
the
bombardier
that
beer
run
had
subtle
bitterness
from
english
challenger
hops
with
color
and
aromas
from
crystal
malt
give
rich
rounded
biscuity
flavor
and
deep
copper
color
plus
love
the
tap
with
cannon
ball
on
it
and
the
new
pint
glasses
huzzahh
overall
a
very
disappointing
beer
pours
a
deep
ruddy
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
the
head
has
great
retention
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
deep
and
rich
malt
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
a
faint
earthy
whiff
the
taste
follows
in
line
with
a
delicious
malt
forward
flavor
and
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
to
round
it
out
the
beers
body
weight
is
perfect
not
too
heavy
or
thin
and
it
has
a
smooth
finish
a
great
pint
of
bitter
if
youre
in
england
always
good
on
cask
rjt
o
overall
its
a
nice
beer
but
not
something
id
probably
pick
up
again
finishes
with
a
medium
bitterness
slight
spices
also
bittery
but
then
again
not
too
bittery
ok
i
guess
the
beer
deserves
a
bit
more
attention
as
a
goto
brew
of
choice
given
its
quality
and
affordability
extremely
solid
drink
overall
a
rather
nice
drier
and
crisper
esb
that
has
a
good
flavor
profile
and
drinkability
a
nice
more
session
style
brew
this
beer
is
simple
to
describe
smooth
feel
faint
bitter
aftertaste
and
easy
going
you
can
knock
down
several
of
these
before
you
realize
that
youve
done
so
it
pairs
best
with
spicy
food
or
any
type
of
food
doused
in
hot
sauce
i
know
for
an
english
pub
beer
youre
probably
thinking
really
spicy
food
pairing
trust
me
spicy
peanuts
steak
with
your
favorite
hot
sauce
or
even
sushi
with
spicy
sauces
are
what
you
need
to
bring
the
most
out
in
this
beer
its
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
the
name
would
suggest
and
the
color
is
not
as
dark
as
you
would
suspect
either
its
just
a
good
beer
a
dark
english
ale
minimal
head
but
laces
nicely
it
does
have
a
full
bodied
taste
can
taste
the
carmel
and
toffee
aftertaste
is
pleasant
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
one
first
tasted
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
it
was
good
enough
to
buy
again
when
i
couldnt
find
a
limited
i
was
looking
for
tonight
and
good
enough
to
buy
again
500
ml
bottle
brown
colour
not
very
big
head
but
it
leaves
a
crown
smells
of
toffee
floral
maybe
some
fruit
medium
body
fizzy
palate
good
carbonation
taste
of
fruits
with
some
chocolate
and
fruits
some
liquorish
dry
finish
but
in
all
in
all
id
just
say
a
good
beer
not
an
extraordinay
one
overall
not
a
bad
english
bitter
at
all
though
perhaps
a
bit
light
in
both
aroma
and
on
the
palate
for
my
liking
a
case
of
16
x
500ml
bottles
is
au90
2013
which
isnt
too
bad
for
i
think
one
or
two
every
now
and
then
full
disclosure
my
numbers
are
probably
0
25
to
0
5
high
because
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
style
also
i
cant
get
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
in
my
hometown
so
this
one
serves
as
a
fine
replacement
crisp
with
a
semidryness
brought
on
not
by
herb
or
leaf
like
many
bitters
but
encouraged
by
the
hops
its
also
softly
but
firmly
carbonated
with
a
solid
crisp
bite
to
it
and
some
creaminess
too
prost
lovely
amber
hues
with
a
nice
frothy
head
some
lacing
one
of
the
best
balanced
bitters
i
have
had
where
the
hops
goldings
i
think
come
forth
at
just
the
rate
level
breadlike
toasty
malt
flavors
develop
throughout
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
indian
food
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
with
high
drinkability
classic
english
bitter
with
great
balance
of
malts
and
noble
hops
english
beers
grew
on
me
and
i
dig
their
traditional
sessionable
like
this
one
and
us
tweaks
that
are
usually
turbinated
i
will
definetley
be
having
this
beer
in
the
near
future
great
bitterness
to
just
overwhelm
the
malt
character
at
the
finish
the
fruity
character
was
unexpected
and
is
not
my
favorite
characteristic
overall
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
no
wonder
that
most
of
the
wells
and
youngs
board
likes
bombardier
could
definitely
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
throughout
the
night
overall
if
youre
expecting
a
nice
easydrinking
english
bitter
such
as
fullers
london
pride
go
elsewhere
this
ale
is
a
little
on
the
aggressive
side
very
tasty
i
like
it
nice
enjoyable
pint
the
brown
notes
of
aroma
and
flavor
are
interesting
and
the
bitterness
in
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
and
helps
to
support
everything
else
that
the
beer
is
giving
well
done
mild
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
esters
primarily
evocative
of
dried
fruit
toffee
malt
backbone
texture
is
soft
but
not
quite
creamy
while
not
a
session
beer
per
the
classic
definition
this
is
something
you
could
enjoy
for
pint
after
pint
compares
quite
favorably
to
fullers
esb
i
have
to
credit
this
beer
to
turning
me
on
to
english
bitters
when
i
first
tried
it
a
couple
years
ago
and
its
something
i
still
go
back
to
every
now
and
then
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
it
is
definitely
a
nice
solid
all
around
enjoyable
session
ale
with
a
discernible
and
respectable
yeast
and
malt
character
could
probably
serve
as
a
gateway
of
sorts
between
sessionable
beers
and
more
dexterous
maybe
even
dextrinous
brews
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
o
good
solid
bitter
light
but
flavorful
and
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
turns
into
a
great
one
as
the
drinking
experience
goes
on
at
first
i
felt
there
was
an
aftertaste
that
was
slightly
offensive
but
as
i
continued
to
sample
the
beer
i
could
no
longer
detect
it
and
that
gave
way
to
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
malt
flavor
is
the
highlight
of
this
libation
with
strong
british
character
the
noble
hops
and
british
yeast
contribute
their
roles
and
play
them
well
as
second
fiddle
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
am
left
wishing
i
had
more
not
for
tonight
but
another
that
i
wanted
a
nice
british
ale
to
improve
it
i
would
like
to
see
a
more
pronounced
head
and
something
to
clean
up
the
slight
dms
aroma
that
is
present
o
bitterness
is
not
rich
as
the
malt
but
still
is
good
but
the
malt
steal
the
show
here
with
an
average
abv
make
this
beer
perfect
as
a
session
beer
still
its
is
complex
enough
to
delight
the
most
demanding
taste
very
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
balanced
short
on
complexity
but
a
nice
session
bitter
satisfying
malt
body
easy
to
drink
with
lots
of
malt
and
hobs
you
can
nearly
taste
some
fresh
tobacco
not
too
strong
so
ideal
beer
for
people
with
some
thirst
and
also
beerconnaisseurs
food
match
just
had
mexican
soft
tacos
which
you
wouldnt
normally
associate
with
an
english
bitter
but
surprisingly
it
works
ole
overall
very
nice
taste
and
very
pleasing
typical
range
of
abv
content
expected
and
pleasing
i
like
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
it
is
not
a
standout
brew
but
is
one
that
can
be
had
in
succession
easily
o
decent
brew
nothing
special
but
a
good

the
aroma
is
awesome
and
just
what
i
want
from
the
style
its
got
an
assertive
but
not
overwhelming
amount
of
caramel
malt
along
with
some
nuts
bright
fruits
and
a
touch
of
pepper
the
taste
is
a
little
less
assertive
than
the
nose
and
comes
on
gently
with
a
bit
of
caramel
before
revealing
everything
from
the
nose
at
once
the
caramel
and
nutty
malts
the
bright
fruits
and
the
bit
of
pepper
rush
right
in
leaving
a
nice
flavorful
yet
mellow
aftertaste
maybe
a
touch
too
much
on
the
fruits
but
otherwise
solid
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
overcarbonated
but
otherwise
nice
the
drinkability
is
very
good

this
is
a
great

from

its
hard
to

these

this
is
more
of
a
lager
than
what
you
would
find
on

in
a

however
its
a
highly
drinkable
sudsy

the

seems
to
be
a
trader
joes
regular

this
beer
was
not
as
i
expected
it
was
a
little
more
sweet
but
still
had
some

in
it
its
very
drinkable
i
got
a
4

pick

this
is
a
good

is
tasty

easy

nice

leaning
more
towards
the
sweet

side
of
things
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
english
ale
it
has
an
incredible
drinkability
owing
to
the
beers
balance
every
element
has
an
integral
place
i
want
to
drink
the
entire
4pack
of
cans
right
now
this
is
lovely
o
very
sessionable
o
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
quite
complex
for
a
lightbodied
beer
there
is
also
a
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
because
it
doesnt
taste
overly
malty
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
o
very
enjoyable
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
gladly
have
another
of
these
i
only
wish
i
could
find
this
one
on
cask
overall
4
5
this
beer
gets
it
right
what
is
it
it
is
how
a
quality
beer
tastes
it
isnt
about
jamming
as
much
hops
and
barley
into
every
aspect
of
the
beer
pallet
its
about
following
tradition
and
keeping
it
right
once
you
have
gotten
it
right

bombardier
hits
the
mark
excellent
english
ale
and
highly
recommended
wonderful
beer
i
wish
youngswells
would
start
sending
it
to
the
us
overall
next
to
anderson
valleys
version
this
one
is
equally
as
good
with
smooth
flavors
and
crisp
taste
worth
trying
if
you
love
the
style
overall
a
solid
brew
from
england
making
its

to
the
states
probably
the
type
of
beer
you
would
expect
to
find
at
english
pubs
good
flavor
good
feel
everything
is
just
about
right
and
proper
with
this
beer
overall
an
easily
quaffable

it

an
earthy
bitter
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
even
sturdy
carbonation
flowing
smooth
i
cant
complain
about
anything
while
drinking
this
beer
overall
very
enjoyable
flavorful
introduction
to
english
ales
damn
good
and
fresh
in
the
can
o
this
is
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
and
it
is
not
bad
yet
i
do
not
think
i
will
pursue
it
again
in
the
future
one
of
best
english
esbs
money
can
buy
very
british
tasting
nice
strong
hops
bite
with
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
a
little
pepper
like
the
smell
but
bitter
hops
is
prevailing
kindoff
a
simple
taste
but
quite
nice
a
good
classic
bitter
o
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
with
lunch
it
would
compliment
most
sandwiches
well
such
as
a
roast
beef
and
cheddar
with
a
soft
horseradish
sauce
or
even
fishnchips
with
a
tasty
tangy
tartar
sauce
more
hopforward
than
the
typical
english
brew
but
not
an
american
hopfest
either
its
an
interesting
juxtaposition
of
lightly
toasted
malts
against
straightforward
bittering
hops
that
delivers
both
sides
of
the
coin
nothing
spectacular
and
not
worth
seeking
out
but
solidly
british
bitter
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
this
was
a
fairly
average
beer
for
me
i
cant
say
id
recommend
it
but
judging
from
other
reviews
ive
seen
online
some
people
really
like
it
so
i
cant
say
its
to
be
avoided
either
either
way
average
beer
for
me
overall
this
is
a
fairly
solid
beer
but
not
up
to
par
compared
with
other
esbs
i
have
had
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
maltiness
overall
pleasant
and
wellbalanced
englishstyle
esb
good

beer
550ml

a
crystalclear
copper
body
with
a
thin
crown
of
khakicolored
head
smells
bready
and
slightly
spicy
freshbaked
bread
permeates
the
tastebuds
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
too
but
only
slightly
light
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
not
much
going
on
here
but
a
passable
beer
nonetheless
o
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
am
not
huge
into
bitters
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
conclusion
this
is
a
good
mass
produced
beer
easy
to
drink
with
pretty
good
flavors
but
why
would
one
ever
drink
it
when
fullers
esb
is
the
same
style
and
not
only
one
of
the
best
bitters
ever
brewed
but
hands
down
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
regularly
available
anywhere
d
very
nice
esb
thats
easydrinking
surprised
at
the
smoothness
and
mellow
taste
sessionable
liking
the
contrasting
back
and
forth
malt
and
hop
nature
oa
good
looking
and
drinkable
bitter
dark
reddish
amber
pour
with
a
thin
head
scant
stickage
smells
of
dark
dried
fruits
plummy
and
figgy
the
taste
has
all
this
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
good
body
to
the
beer
but
not
the
best
esb
ive
had
my
vote
is
with
fullers
but
i
do
need
to
drink
more
of
this
style
a
middle
of
the
road
esb
feels
a
bit
too
dry
and
roasty
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
o
a
really
rich
and
sweet
english
ale
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
tap
or
out
of
the
bottle
because
the
metallic
taste
brought
this
down
some
for
me
o
very
nice
ale
not
as
much
head
retention
as
id
hoped
and
little
aroma
hops
but
still
fine
ale
ill
have
another
man
i
like
this
beer
yummmm
served
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
decent
sized
light
tan
head
that
slowly
settled
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
copper
with
some
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
very
toffee
caramel
malt
fresh
beer
along
with
a
little
leather
and
roast
flavor
is
like
nose
plus
a
little
carbonic
tang
and
biscuit
body
carbonation
are
just
right
for
this
style
finish
is
like
flavor
of
medium
lenght
and
readies
me
for
another
quaff
super
drinkable
beer
i
want
more
o
really
nice
i
enjoyed
it
im
a
big
believer
in
english
ale
and
now
a
believer
in
english
ale
from
a
can
wells
bombardier
is
a
freshtasting
offering
cold
from
the
fridge
and
as
it
warms
a
bit
as
with
any
good
ale
you
can
feel
its
glory
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
glad
this
was
not
a
widget
can
with
a
nitrogenated
head
doesnt
need
that
the
head
is
fine
the
aroma
of
malt
and
english
hops
plenty
evident
the
only
bitter
i
can
compare
this
to
from
my
limited
experience
is
fullers
esb
which
i
have
had
quite
a
few
times
on
tap
in
canterbury
ales
in
huntington
ny
so
far
the
malt
and
hop
flavor
profile
of
ales
in
the
bitter
family
are
among
my
absolute
favorites
in
beerdom
you
will
get
that
oneofakind
malty
aromatic
goodness
even
from
this
can
of
bombardier
perhaps
the
only
thing
better
is
real
ale
freshly
casked
from
the
brewer
barring
that
give
this
a
try
very
recommended
o
easy
to
drink
only
roughly
5
abv
really
kinda
bland
for
my
taste
buds
cheers
d
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
a
hold
of
this
one
i
guess
the
opportunity
never
presented
itself
it
looks
absolutely
amazing
feels
just
as
good
tastes
and
smells
awesome
and
drinks
like
a
champ
and
the
modest
abv
means
this
4pack
will
not
live
to
see
the
morrow
old
chap
a
real
treat
from
across
the
pond
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
little
boring
and
one
dimensional
it
basically
just
maltscaramel
and
some
dry
hops
ill
stick
with
a
fullers
esb
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
o
i
found
the
bombardier
to
be
a
classic
and
great
example
of
the
style
its
an
inviting
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
as
a
oneoff
or
as
a
session
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
on
cask
again
o
good
but
that
smoky
flavor
detracts
also
a
bit
too
fruity
for
my
preference
o
decent
bit
on
the
bland
side
an
old
faithful
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
it
didnt
have
the
taste
profile
i
was
expecting
or
had
hoped
for
a
quality
bitter
balanced
with
good
bitter
tones
and
a
long
finish
o
pretty
easy
drinking
english
ale
nothing
remarkable
about
it
to
make
it
stand
out
but
its
good
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
would
be
good
with
any
pubenglish
fare
final
grade

an
a
good
beer
albeit
a
tad
sweet
hence
down
a
bit
in
drinkability
after
the
initial
flavour
burst
medium
bodied
lingering
malty
finish
great
sessioner
a
good
ol
drinking
beer
when
you
just
want
something
tasty
and
wet
and
are
in
no
rush
to
challenge
your
taste
buds
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
really
nice
poofy
head
luxurious
like
thick
cream
the
beer
was
amber
colored
and
had
a
slight
bit
of
a
malty
taste
that
i
really
liked
it
was
not
bitter
i
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
it
really
should
be
served
at
cellar
not
fridge
temperatures
its
an
excellent
english
esb
and
i
prefer
the
canned
version
to
the
bottled
i
applaud
the
brewery
for
not
succumbing
to
the
widget
gimmick
the
beer
is
however
perhaps
a
bit
over
carbonated
notes
wow
what
a
beer
a
great
looking
beer
with
multiple
layers
of
flavor
well
constructed
delicious
soul
lifting
ill
be
buying
more
this
pours
a
very
nice
looking
dark
amber
dark
reddish
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
head
the
smell
is
much
more
malty
and
toasty
than
anything
else
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
like
the
smells
lots
of
toasty
malts
a
little
sweet
for
a
esb
the
bitters
hop
presence
is
low
and
nothing
very
noticeable
overall
this
one
was
good
but
i
prefer
a
fullers
esb
overall
one
of
the
better
british
ales
and
worth
trying
overall
not
a
bad
english
beer
if
nothing
special
definitely
not
as
hoppy
as
some
other
english
esbs
im
looking
at
you
fullers
but
the
malt
notes
are
nice
here
not
really
anything
wrong
with
it
and
it
certainly
kicks
the
butts
of
some
other
easytofind
english
imports
and
the
fact
that
the
brewery
dates
them
is
awesome
but
theres
not
really
anything
that
would
lead
me
to
purchase
this
again
if
some
other
english
options
were
available
black
sheep
fullers
etc
that
being
said
if
someone
handed
me
one
id
gladly
accept
happy
drinking

the
pour
is
a
handsome
darker
amber
with
just
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
classic
british
ale
with
brightly
sweet
caramel
malts
and
cleanliness
the
body
was
smooth
and
in
the
medium
territory
with
a
powerful
sweet
malty
taste
and
a
decent
bitter
hop
bite
on
the
end
a
fine
example
of
the
style
as
an
aside
i
think
the
can
is
the
correct
delivery
method
for
this
beer
its
cheaper
than
the
bottle
and
has
a
freshness

says

all
hail
bombardier
o
a
decent
tasting
beer
that
looks
better
than
it
tastes
oi
havent
had
a
large
amount
of
esbs
but
im
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
them
its
very
easy
to
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
the
lacing
on
the
glass
was
very
nice
i
also
like
that
the
can
is
a
bit
big
why
not
more
is
better
o
a
solid
esb
very
drinkable
and
tasty
the
bottle
describes
it
as
england
in
a
glass
and
i
have
to
agree
totally
worth
trying
especially
at
just
over
3
a
bottle
poured
a
2
offwhite
head
which
took
a
while
to
settle
down
lovely
clear
reddish
amber
color
when
held
to
the
light
smells
of
malt
taste
is
mild
and
pleasant
with
a
crispness
like
a
lager
but
a
little
more
malt
in
the
flavor
and
theres
a
moderately
long
finish
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
a
popular
classic
d
a
textbook
esb
in
all
facets
a
very
solid
offering
that
doesnt
disappoint
but
also
doesnt
excel
either
not
too
shabby
brown
esb
head
is
a
bit
creamy
but
dissipates
the
smell
is
grain
and
bread
the
taste
is
heavy
malt
more
grain
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
east
kent
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
butteriness
low
carbonation
standard
for
the
style
but
a
little
bit
prickly
not
bad
not
great
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
i
was
closer
to
the
source
i
have
a
feeling
if
this
beer
was
fresh
it
would
be
a
whole
different
experience
no
freshness
date
listed
quality
beer
but
with
price
being
equal
ill
buy
a
fullers
esb
everytime
d
not
quite
what
i
was
imagining
but
not
bad
either
perhaps
i
should
have
had
this
one
at
a
more
traditional
rooms
temperature
but
seeing
as
how
its
100f
now
that
didnt
seem
like
the
best
option
taste
was
quite
malty
tad
bitter
and
a
tad
sweet
good
drinkability
good
carbonation
overall
pretty
enjoyable
o
a
decent
bitter
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
felt
very
good
in
the
mouth
little
carbonation
but
a
pleasure
to
swallow
overall
i
give
this
beer
an
a
a
quality
bitter
with
alot
going
on
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
decent
drop
nice
with
some
good
old
english
fish
and
chips
thin
bodied
with
a
sweet
malt
profile
and
a
faint
floral
hop
presence
providing
balance
hints
of
caramel
toffee
but
and
biscuit
nice
dry
hop
presence
provides
subtle
balance
not
really
bitter
but
enough
to
counter
sweetness
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
complex
really
watered
down
and
bland
i
really
like
cask
conditioned
beers
but
this
was
like
slightly
malty
water
d
outstanding
i
could
drink
this
all
day
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
highly
recommended
cheers
nores
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
traditional
english
esb
moderate
to
medium
in
body
and
quite
easy
to
drink
maybe
the
best
english
beer
to
come
out
of
a
can
that
i
have
tried
very
well
puttogether
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
copperish
amber
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
there
was
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
had
some
nice
malt
aromas
and
grains
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
pretty
mellow
and
had
a
good
bitterness
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
overall
its
pretty
good
esb
i
liked
it
but
at
twice
the
price
of
the
fosters
bitter
imo
the
better
tastevalue
for
a
bitter
ale
goes
to
the
fosters
bitter
pour
is
steady
with
very
little
head
produced
cask
brew
in
a
can
beer
is
dark
brown
producing
some
nice
lacing
after
the
first
few
sips
malty
buttery
and
some
very
light
butterscotch
flavor
here
nice
dry
bitter
finish
and
refreshing
as
can
be
at
just
over
5
alcohol
this
is
pretty
light
by
todays
standards
but
the
amount
of
flavor
from
this
beer
is
pretty
amazing
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
easy
drinking
english
ales
glad
to
see
this
in
a
can
will
be
on
this
a
good
deal
this
summer
generally
a
classic
beer
this
one
of
my
early
favorites
when
i
first
discovered
beer
could
taste
good
mahogany
pour
tan
to
black
with
little
head
malt
sweetnes
on
the
nose
with
little
other
hints
as
to
flavor
a
tasty
esb
and
a
very
even
brew
a
nice
well
rounded
malt
character
with
a
nice
subtle
hop
finish
the
body
is
slight
and
nearly
thin
though
the
style
seems
to
demand
it
for
this
reason
i
cannot
judge
negatively
on
lack
of
texture
over
all
this
is
a
good
drinkin
brew
with
moderate
abv
and
a
really
casual
flavor
and
feel
i
like
it
the
crack
glug
surprised
me
with
two
thick
fingers
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
nose
had
a
bready
biscuity
maltiness
to
it
and
suddenly
my
mouth
was
watering
color
was
a
deep
ruby
red
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mildly
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
initially
followed
by
a
wash
of
grassy
hops
finish
was
more
malty
than
bitter
very
pleasant
with
a
mild
chocolatiness
that
seemed
to
linger
i
would
definitely
want
this
in
my
cooler
and
i
will
have
to
pick
some
more
up
on
my
next
foray
starts
of
tasting
quite
hoppy
but
the
hops
fades
while
drinking
it
and
the
carbonation
dominates
most
of
the
taste
after
a
few
sips
towards
the
last
sips
when
most
of
the
carbonation
is
gone
it
tastes
a
little
bit
like
dirty
coins
this
should
be
what
budweiser
tastes
like
super
quaffable
and
high
quality
good
wtfever
beer
to
go
with
a
simple
meal
or
a
movie
but
i
wish
i
could
try
it
on
cask
maybe
then
it
would
have
some
complexity
and
real
aroma
extreamly
drinkable
solid
mouthfeel
the
right
amount
of
lively
carbonation
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
which
is
not
a
lot
admittidly
d
a
tasty
easydrinking
esb
with
low
enough
abv
to
be
easily
sessionable
strong
example
of
the
style
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
ontap
but
the
cask
conditioning
takes
it
to
another
level
very
much
worth
a
shot
if
you
find
it
served
on
cask
dr
too
pricey
for
how
relatively
unremarkable
it
is
o
a
decent
session
beer
but
nothing
special
i
could
drink
this
at
any
time
its
aboveaverage
but
not
great
in
my
books
drinkability
good
version
of
the
style
this
was
a
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
as
i
finish
the
pint
i
note
that
the
flavors
smooth
out
nicely
with
warming
dont
sample
this
too
cold
d
very
much
an
esb
but
not
in
the
realm
of
fullers
classic
for
me
the
taste
is
pretty
good
though
drink
this
above
55f
for
the
full
experience
drinkability
for
this
whole
style
is
way
up
for
me
i
really
love
the
assertive
hops
balanced
with
bready
malts
and
this
particular
beer
is
just
that
balanced
and
highly
quaffable

drinkability
fairly
drinkable
about
what
id
expect
from
an
ale
overall
a
very
nice
brew
a
worthy
companion
for
a
comfortable
session
at
your
local
or
home
worth
trying
a
very
dry
finish
rounds
this
beer
out
very
nicely
i
think
i
could
easily
sit
at
the
local
pub
all
night
drinking
these
back
without
batting
an
eyelid
great
beer
a
decent
esb
and
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
like
this
kind
of
beer
a
decent
ale
not
likely
to
become
my
regular
but
representative
of
english
beer
poured
a
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
bready
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
pepper
the
ale
was
thick
malty
and
smooth
bittering
hops
came
through
in
the
middle
before
fading
somewhat
in
the
finish
a
very
nice
full
body
session
ale
watch
the
alcohol
as
you
will
not
notice
it
until
you
stand
an
offering
that
teeters
well
away
from
the
banality
that
i
unfortunately
encounter
too
much
in
imported
british
ales
i
sure
wouldnt
pass
up
a
few
rounds
of
this
as
the
local
pub
bitter
option
if
that
sort
of
thing
actually
existed
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
drinkablity
could
drink
it
all
day
dpleasant
one
of
the
lightest
bitters
ive
had
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
with
the
pals
drinkability
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
had
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one
drinkability
for
an
esb
the
bitterness
is
prevalent
here
which
works
well
i
think
i
prefer
a
beer
with
a
bit
more
malt
present
but
overall
i
like
this
one
although
with
the
strong
bitter
finish
im
definitely
done
at
one
pint
went
very
well
with
turkey
spiced
sweet
potatoes
and
green
beans
a
solidly
good
english
ale
d
great
session
beer
enough
flavor
for
beer
geeks
and
something
adventurous
for
your
newbies
not
usually
great
beer
for
the
warmer
months
give
this
english
brew
a
try
its
worth
it
solid
brew
here
is
a
very
clear
light
chestnut
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
notably
malty
with
a
caramel
and
toasted
malt
character
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
a
very
englishstyle
biscuit
and
toffee
scent
the
taste
is
more
on
the
dry
side
than
the
smell
presumes
its
moderately
bitter
and
very
satisfying
all
around
this
is
fine
englishstyle
ale
d
an
unassuming
but
eventually
delicious
beer
more
depth
than
i
have
come
to
expect
of
british
ales
perhaps
unfairly
bombardier
bitter
is
well
worth
your
time
and
attention
i
will
be
having
a
few
more
pours
a
copper
brown
colour
with
thick
off
white
head
head
takes
a
long
time
to
dissipate
some
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
raisin
biscuit
malt
and
mild
earthy
hops
flavour
has
mild
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
nice
medium
bodied
carbonation
i
like
that
the
control
board
in
ontario
has
this
so
i
can
frequently
have
this
dpretty
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
decent
but
the
price
tag
does
not
match
up
with
the
quality
of
this
one
a
nice
mouth
feel
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
rainy
evening
looks
to
be
a
good
dark
red
amber

lovely

it
slides

my

the

nice
sweetness
on
the
aftertaste
that
really
impresses
me
one
of
the
few
beers
that
has
given
me
the
belches
this
is
one
to
impress
the
guests
a
little
pricey
but
worth
the
expense
to
round
out
a
good
meal
not
one
i
would
serve
at
the
typical
backyard
gathering
or
time
in

the

watching

this
beer
deserves
more
than

aroma
has
some
biscuity
maltness
and
muted
fruits
and
baked
bread
in
it

is
perfectly
balanced
leaning
toward
the
malty
with
a
nice
fruitiness
common
in
most
bitters
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
from
the
hops
a
nearperfect
british
ale
here
perfect
for
just
having
a
pint
or
three
id
drink
this
again
and
its
not
to
much
money
so
no
reason
not
to
try
it
this
is
a
competitive
segment
for
me
i
feel
its
a
worthy
beer
but
not
sure
how
well
it
stacks
up
against
the
other
esbs
in
the
neighborhood
i
really
enjoyed
the
oldschool
feel
of
this
strong
bitter
and
felt
that
it
captured
its
british
roots
quite
well
id
love
to
drink
this
as
a
session
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
this
was
thirst
quenching
a
very
good
english
ale
a
little
different
but
nice
i
feel
like
it
begs
to
be
paired
with
some
chocolate
nibs
or
some
other
desserty
confection
of
small
quantity
andor
volume
a
well
balanced
and
good
bitter
wells
bombadier
comes
off
the
pump
looking
burnt
orange
with
a
slight
copper
hue
with
a
few
cenimeters
of
bubbles
leaing
faint
stick
smells
of
toasted
malt
faint
sugars
and
banana
slight
caramel
taste
is
very
slightly
bitter
but
very
authentic
some
cereal
and
toasted
malt
with
faint
biscuit
bread
bananas
and
caramel
simple
and
semi
sweet
feel
is
a
real
smooth
criminal
no
interference
whatsoever
less
than
medium
bodied
carb
on
the
light
side
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
something
in
the
taste
dept
is
lacking
this
is
plain
tasting
great
beer
if
that
makes
any
sense
d
so
easy
to
drink
it
might
as
well
be
water
but
even
better
this
is
what
the
uk
does
every
day
i
can
get
down
with
that
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
worth
a
look
amber
to
brown
in
color
but
clear
with
visible
carbonation
the
buoyant
34
head
began
to
dissipate
quickly
but
then
settled
into
a
foamy
coating
that
lingered
while
i
drank
the
rest
of
the
beer
very
prominent
caramel
and
toffee
aromas
carry
over
to
the
palate
and
there
is
a
pleasant
balance
of
these
flavors
along
with
some
nutty
flavors
against
some
toasted
malt
and
dry
hoppiness
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
that
is
a
great
food

anything

of

of

with
touches
of

green

and
and
almost
avocado

smell
little
to
none
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
just
a
bit
average
really
maybe
its
just
the
style
medium
dry
finish
with
a
body
just
a

too
watery
from
my
liking
d
i
really
wish
our
breweries
over
here
could
match
the
greatness
of
true
english
bitters
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
textures
are
subtle
yet
distinctive
the
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
and
its
a
perfect
session
beer
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
any

of
pale
malts
and
somewhat
bready
thought
it
was
a
little
bland
as
i
was
expecting
more
pronounced
malt
character
mouthfeel
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
creamy
cask
flavored
english
ale
a
great
session
beer
to
chat
over
with
some
friends
overall
i
was
disappointed
as
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
malts
normally
characterful
english
yeast
didnt
really
taste
that
bitter
nor
was
it
strong
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
label
seemed
to
mislead
me
but
its
probably
just
the
traditional
vs
the
last
15
years
digression
cheers
d
easy

interesting
flavours
best
fresh
i
expect
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
copper
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dwindled
to
a
ring
caramel
malts
mingled
with
some
fruity
esters
mainly
apple
and
pear
most
of
the
malt
taste
has
a
caramel
quality
to
it
with
a
slight
roasted
andor
burnt
quality
it
sat
in
good
balance
with
the
bitter
hops
and
the
smooth
medium
body
seemed
right
for
the
style
this
is
an
easy
drinking
esb
and
the
perfect
beer
to
introduce
the
style
to
some
one
i
can
recommend
this
one
i
would
call
this
one
mediumbodied
there
is
a
good
level
of
carbonation
all
around
a
good
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
nothing
is
overpowering
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
oldfashioned
english
esp
with
a
distinct
flair
this
is
how
a
picture
a
steady
session
style
english
brew
i
like
it
and
pretty
good
considering
how
old
this
beer
is
ill
have
to
try
a
fresher
sample
soon
overall
otter
maris
pale
malt
stays
only
slightly
ahead
of
the
east
kent
golding
hops
tasty
and
easytodrink
i
have
only
found
in
singles
but
this
one
should
be
in
12
oz
6packs
as
it
makes
for
a
nice
sessionable
beer
drinkability
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
i
could
quaff
this
baby
all
night
long
the
flavors
are
very
pleasant
yet
mellow
begging
for
another
big
sip
md
to
me
the
texture
is
more
fizzy
than
necessary
making
this
med
full
flavoured
ale
slightly
offbalance
on
the
palate
it
reminds
me
of
plenty
of
youngs
ales
all
wellcrafted
sharing
the
fruity
yeastiness
and
solid
flavoursome
hopmix
using
nothing
but
fuggles
sussex
goldings
and
styrian
goldings
a
solid
premium
ale
this
is
i
wish
it
wont
be
discontinued
with
the
rams
moving
north
overall
this
is
a
good
esb
its
best
strength
is
definitely
its
balance
recommended
drinkability
i
could
definitely
commit
myself
to
a
night
of
these
very
pleasant
taste
nice
mouthfeel
and
its
not
too
filling
in
fact
after
having
one
i
want
a
second
right
now
an
ok
sessionable
esb
could
be
worse
but
could
be
alot
better
i
really
liked
this
from
the
first
sip
the
initial
sweet
flavor
is
very
gradually
replaced
by
a
little
hop
bitterness
but
not
overpowering
this
one
is
more
subtle
which
makes
it
pretty
easy
drinking
really
all
in
all
i
liked
it
would
i
buy
it
again
only
after
i
try
it
on
cask
if
they
even
it
put
it
on
cask
anywhere
a
nice
english
bitter
pours
a
bronzed
copper
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
a
pleasure
to
look
at
smell
is
of
buttery
toffee
and
light
caramel
malts
a
nice
floral
hop
nose
the
taste
is
smooth
and
delightful
a
creamy
taste
of
milk
and
caramel
with
a
buttered
toast
hops
are
light
but
pleasant
enjoyable
drinkability
is
high
i
like
this
style
a
lot
for
a
session
beer
as
with
other
esbs
if
they
were
more
availablecheaper
here
in
the
us
i
would
drink
them
more
as
it
is
i
find
it
hard
to
come
back
from
the
beer
store
without
at
least
one
after
being
somewhat
turned
off
by
this
beer
i
looked
at
the
best
before
date
and
im
drinking
this
5
months
too
late
i
dont
know
the
magnitude
of
the
change
in
taste
but
ill
give
this
one
another
chance
later
note
this
makes
me
think
of
super
troopers
why
well

500
ml
bottle
best
by
august
2005
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
this
is
a
crystal
clear
copper
with
a
big
head
that
billows
up
slightly
over
the
top
of
the
glass
nice
retention
moderate
amount
of

is
a
little
musty
with
some
light
floral
notes
and
an

with
a

taste
is
very
mellowa
slightly
buttery

a
gentle
leafy

and
an

melded
togatherlingering
finish
is
slightly
bitter
slightly
caramelly
medium
bodied
with
a
gentle
carbonation
and
a
silky
smooth
feel
this
is
a
real
solid
esb
easily
a
sessionable
beer
the
taste
can
be
described
as
a
slightly
above
average
taste
and
has
a
definite
fruity
tone
one
interesting
characteristic
i
noticed
is
that
after
about
10
seconds
you
get
a
taste
on
your
palate
that
feels
and
tastes
kind
of
like
mango
wack
it
should
be
noted
that
the
date
on
the
bottle
says
best
before
march
05
im
going
to
review
this
one
again
when
i
get
a
fresher
bottle
though
i
dont
think
this
one
tasted
old
recommended
so
this
is
a
traditional
english
bitter
would
love
to
try
on
tap
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
great
session
brew
an
aboveaverage
brew
that
like
i
said
would
be
great
to
have
a
session
with
not
as
tasty
or
complex
as
its
esb
cousins
but
then
again
thats
why
they
are
esbs
and
this
is
not
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
but
will
probably
opt
for
the
esb
next
time
or
the
youngs
special
london
ale
5
makes
for
a
good
session

i
would
not
classify
this
one
as
an
esb
ram
rod
is
copper
colored
with
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
for
carbonation
the
goodsized
head
is
creamy
and
off
white
the
aroma
is
an
inviting
combination
of
english
malts
and
fruity
hops
the
taste
has
plenty
of
english
malt
flavor
somewhat
earthy
with
notes
of
caramel
hops
provide
a
moderate
bitterness
and
some
dry
fruity
flavor
the
finish
leaves
a
lingering
caramel
sweeetness
this
is
definently
an
ale
i
could
use
as
a
session
beer
there
are
plenty
of
very
good
flavors
but
nothing
here
blows
my
mind
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
foamy
tan
head
really
attractive
beer
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
herbal
character
big
caramel
malt
sweetness
up
front
with
a
little
bit
of
fruity
and
buttery
characteristics
hop
bite
is
strong
and
herbal
but
not
unbalanced
or
unpleasant
in
the
least
some
have
called
the
hop
flavor
tealike
and
i
can
definitely
see
that
mouthfeel
is
slightly
metallic
at
the
finish
really
delicious
english
ale
fully
deserving
of
its
reputation
a
quintessential
bitter
and
a
good
session
beer
an
amberorange
ale
with
a
nice
cap
and
modest
carbonation
nose
carries
notes
of
sweet
ripe
fruit
and
a
musty
earthy
tone
sweet
chewy
malt
up
front
subdued
hops
add
tartness
to
sweet
cidery
tastes
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
gets
slightly
dry
with
the
bittering
coming
in
and
leaving
a
metalic
after
taste
well
crafted
a
sweet
but
mellow
bitter
for
those
who
really
dont
like
bitter
ales
drinkability
good
session
bitter
excellent
midstrength
ale
from
youngs
and
definitely
one
ill
drink
again
light
bodied
assertive
carbonation
not
as
good
as
i
expected
but
a
reliable
basic
british
ale
pours
a
golden

with
a
thick
frothy
head
not
an
inuendo
sweet
to
the
smellvery

wow
very
nice
beer
the
sweetness
is
in
the
taste
as
well
this
beer
is
much
thicker
than
i
would
think
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
really
try
it
lightly
carbonated
and
easydrinking
a
bit
restrained
in
aroma
and
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
a
nice
session

regardless

sample
and
enjoy
its
understated
britishness
notes
of

breadyyeasty

minerally
and
smooth
in
the

wont
do
much
for
over
hopped

lovers
as
i
consider
myself
but
its
a
pleasant
respite
and
a
quaffable
enjoyable
brew
after
stumbling
across
youngs
dirty
dicks
which
i
liked
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
i
was
disappointed
pours
a
dark
brown
maybe
a
hint
of
red
not
much
head
to
speak
of
the
taste
was
overpowering
and
not
a
good
taste
at
that
everyone
has
different
tastes
so
i
am
sure
others
may
like
this
i
did
not
find
this
as
something
i
could
drink
many
of
at
a
sitting
in
fact
i
found
that
i
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
it
instead
of
grabbing
something
else
medium
brownamber
body
topped
by
a
thick
creamy
head
aroma
of
bourbon
malts
accented
by
a
slight
fruitiness
flavor
is
rather
aggressive
with
a
strong
wood
component
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
is
also
present
up
front
the
finish
has
a
lingering
earthiness
slight
amount
of
higher
alcohols
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
im
not
thrilled
with
this
beer
another
value
pickup
i
consider
myself
a
youngs
appreciater
and
this
does
not
leave
me
wanting
more
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
slight
tinge
of
gold
a
2
finger
head
subsides
to
a
small
foam
cap
pleasant
albeit
weak
aromas
of
toffee
and

provide
a
sweet

taste
is
well
balanced
starting
off
with
toffee
notes
before
fading
into
the
slightest
hop
bitterness
nice
and
malty
this
one
is
superbly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
nicely

smooth

a

bitterness
there
but
understated
and
sweetened
down
unusual
and
something
we
could

overall
taste
is
apricot

finish
is
nice
and
bitter
like
it
should
be
pretty
straightforward
with
nothing
exceptional
about
it
an
ok
bitter
very
good
session
beer
when
im
in
london
i
always
make
a
trip
to
one
of
the
youngs
pubs
which
have
excellent
quite
affordable
food
and
you
can
get
both
this
and
their
ordinary
bitter
in
cask
few
things
are
better
the
beer
upon
its
release
from
the
500ml
brown
bottle
pours
a
clarion
copper
color
with
a
moderate
sized
semicreamy
light
tan
head
and
the
resultant
lace
a
concealing
sheet
nose
is
sweet
malt
hints
of
yeast
clean
and
fresh
to
the
senses
start
is
sweet
with
a
full
malt
profile
top
feel
light
to
moderate
finish
is
stern
in
its
acidity
the
hops
pleasantly
spicy
and
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
a
fine
esb
in
its
own
right
and
a
style
i
find
pleasing
time
to
start
the
new
year
off
with
watching
a
little
football
and
drinking
some
beers
this
one
begins
my
day
pours
a
yellow
orange
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
smell
is
kinda
sweet
and
earthy
taste
begins
really
nice
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
fullers
esb
but
after
a
few
sips
it
really
falls
apart
theres
a
bready
flavor
and
some
earthy
spicy
hops
but
both
are
overshadowed
by
this
candy
corn
tasting
sweetness
that
really
gets
cloying
theres
seems
to
be
some
diacetyl
here
as
well
shit
this
was
good
at
first
but
now
i
can
barely
finish
it
i
think
12
oz
would
have
been
enough
drinkability
which
is
the
perfect
segue
into
this
characteristic
easy
enough
to
drink
i
drank
the
pint
in
little
to
no
time
whatsoever
if
you
like
english
pub
ales
this
is
a
must
try
solid
offering
from
youngs
really
good
beer
perfect
for
sitting
down
and
putting
a
few
away
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
bready
malts
carmel
flavors
with
a
sweet
buttery
note
solid
mouthfeel
without
being
heavy
carbonation
was
low
but
enough
to
provide
a
healthy
cap
of
white
foam
over
the
clear
copper
body
great
drinkability
one
of
the
few
english
ales
i
really
enjoy
ideal
for
a
session
ale
and
a
topnotch
english
bitter
this
is
a
very
drinkable
esb
given
the
abv
and
how
smooth
it
goes
down
nothing
to
really
seek
out
in
terms
of
the
style
but
you
wont
be
disappointed
if
you
order
a
pint
this
poured
an
orangey
amber
color
huge
and
hefty
head
of
tan
creamy
foam
nice
intricate
lacing
on
the
glass
low
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
bitter
tannic
and
has
some
slightly
metallic
and
fruity
notes
along
with
some
sharp
graininess
actually
this
has
the
pungent
aroma
of
old
wet
cardboard
interesting
the
taste
is
bittersweet
with
dry
and
fruity
malt
base
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
it
becomes
increasing
more
flavorful
solid
malt
body
and
a
nice
dryness
emerges
in
the
finish
a
nicely
pleasant
english
ale
and
one
that
i
like
to
revisit
once
in
awhile
blood
red
color
with
highlights
of
orange
in
the
glass
poured
with
a
small
white
head
and
did
not
leave
much
lacing
smells
of
butterscotch
discs
toffee
and
something
lightly
soapy
taste
is
dry
with
strong
butterscotch
grassy
malt
and
light
hops
mouthfeel
is
buttery
slick
moderate
carbonation
a
different
and
delicious
ale
doesnt
taste
quite
as
good
as
it
smells
though
smooth
and
caramel
sweet
upfront
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
bitternessreally
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
flavors
fizzy
carbonation
but
with
a
full
body
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
at
just
a
little
bit
below
room
temp
this
would
be
a
great
food
beer
ram
rod
is
a
quality
esb
even
if
it
doesnt
overly
impress
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
flavor
but
thats
all
right
sometimes
on
occasion
we
all
need
a
beer
that
we
can
settle
into
like
an
old
pair
of
slippers
and
enjoy
for
its
simple
pleasant
drinkability
this
is
just
such
a
beer
pouring
from
the
500ml
a
transparent
coppery
honey
a
little
brown
and
a
little
red
just
what
is
expected
colourwise
brilliant
and
clear
the
head
was
a
healthy
size
and
has
ample
duration
churning
from
twofingers
down
to
a
thin
1
cm
but
creamy
and
complete
covering
of
cream
coloured
foam
after
pouring
it
formed
quite
large
bubbles
on
top
the
lacing
is
screenlike
full
immediately
after
tilting
then
it
patches
and
runs
the
glass
quite
quickly
definitely
a
better
than
average
appearance
perfect
amount
of
fruit
on
the
nose
with
subtle
sweethoney
smells
some
dusty
smells
caramel
but
with
subtle
but
wellbalanced
hop
the
fruitiness
is
hard
to
pinpointsubtle
apple
plum
perhaps
and
sweeter
fruits
such
as
peach
there
are
also
some
definite
yeast
characteristics
revealed
by
the
somewhat
dusty
earthy
aromas
i
immediately
taste
the
dusty
quality
too
on
my
first
sip
both
from
the
generous
hop
and
the
yeast
the
finish
is
exceptional
hop
flavournot
overdone
but
definitely
the
defining
feel
in
the
aftertaste
three
cheers
for
balance
here
the
crystal
malt
leaves
the
tongue
just
sweet
enough
to
counterbalance
the
dryness
left
by
the
hops
whilst
not
supressing
the
full
and
robust
hoppiness
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
is
the
sweetness
and
myriad
fruits
as
well
as
some
sugary
butterscotch
a
dryer
mouthfeel
but
not
so
dry
that
it
inhibits
further
drinking
and
all
this
combines
for
firstrate
drinkability
for
hopheads
or
maltheads
this
would
be
perfect
over
a
good
ploughmans
lunch
and
it
goes
extraordinarily
well
with
smoked
jarlsberg
cheese
i
might
add
overall
not
too
bad
i
feel
obligated
to
rereview
this
one
making
sure
to
find
a
bottle
that
hasnt
passed
its
expiration
date
500

the
offwhite

large
tufts
of

to
the

of

the
color
on
this
brew
is
a
light
dark
wheatchestnut
color
woody
relatively
low
carbonation
im
into
the
aroma
but
the
beer
has
to
be
warm
for
the
smells
to
come
out
english
hops
malt
and
a
yeastybreadiness
the
taste
is
nutty
with
butterscotch
and
caramel
notes
its
not
really
a
sweet
beer
but
has
a
malt
and
dough
like
flavor
finish
is
clean
and
a
little
flowery
no
complaints
with
this
beer
the
top
of
the
foamy

as
it
fades
to
a
thin
film
clear
liquid
copper
colored

with
no
sign
of

of
crisp

hops
and
a

takes
over

esb
nothing
else
really
stands
out
dn
my
thanks
again
to
max
at
ds
six
packs
for
being
my
beer
guru
this
one
was
purely
at
his
recommendation
and
as
always
he
leadeth
me
to
good
beer
nice
flavors
nice
aromas
very
drinkable
drinkability
pretty
tasty
a
nice
beer
for
the
macro
swillers
wanting
something
to
bridge
them
to
better
beers
this
brew
is
a
clear
dark
gold
colored
drink
with
a
big
bubbly
white
head
bitter
hops
and
dark
malts
on
the
nose
as
for
the
taste
it
starts
off
with
a
nice
delicious
whack
of
bitter
english
hops
sweet
malt
med
to
full
mouth
all
you
need
to
know
is
english
and
esb
and
excellent
brew
one
you
could
drink
till
the
sun
come
up
good
nofrills
esb
overall
a
decent
ale
that
wasnt
quite
up
to
par
with
youngs
other
offerings
my
bottle
did
say
best
before
end
of
jan
2004
so
this
could
have
handicapped
it
slightly
regardless
youngs
makes
awesome
beers
brew
poured
to
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
disappeared
quickly
with
hardly
any
lacing
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
of
haybuttery
like
malt
a
floral
hop
and
a
fruit
sweetness
that
i
think
i
am
picking
up
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
it
has
just
enough
carbonation
and
tastes
of
the
malt
and
fruit
sweetness
that
push
through
nicely
with
a
good
hop
bite
that
brings
this
brew
together
nice
brew
not
a
favorite
but
is
would
be
one
that
i
could
have
a
nice
evening
with
a
drinkable
brew
but
not
a
big
beer
i
like
more
tastes
than
are
present
here
the
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
amber
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
it
had
a
straight
up
smell
of
malt
and
hops
just
a
good
beer
semll
the
taste
was
sharp
and
hoppy
it
was
light
clean
and
just
slightly
oily
this
beer
had
a
distinct
quality
about
it
the
bitterness
let
you
know
you
were
experiencing
a
classic
british
bitter
this
was
the
first
i
really
tried
and
will
have
to
explore
some
more
the
high
amount
of
hops
is
not
high
on
my
list
so
i
dont
see
me
becoming
a
regular
consumer
but
definately
a
beer
i
will
try
again
is
red
hook
esb
to
much
for
you
try
this
one
atruly
great
beer
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
i
rarely
order
the
same
beer
twice
especially
with
a
selection
of
30
craft
beers
but
i
drank
this
all
night
one
pint
is
not
nearly
enough
for
me
every
sip
is
amazing
just
savoring
the
perfect
flavor
i
really
cant
think
of
a
flaw
with
this
stuff
but
i
reserve
my
perfect
score
for
the
cask
conditioned
version
finish
is
a
long
and
mellow
hop
bitter
dry
and
satisfying
encouraging
another
imho
one
of
the
best
session
beers
available
excellent
youngs
beer
pours
a
very
nice
head
that
slowys
dissapates
and
laces
quite
well
a
very
clear
amber
color
smell
is
malty
and
of
carmel
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
mild
bitterness
goes
very
well
with
malty
taste
at
the
end
of
the
taste
is
a
warmimg
note
amber
color
with
an
orange
hazy
tinge
the
head
was
light
beige
and
dissipated
to
lacing
very
quickly
the
smell
was
dry
and
bitter
with
slight
notes
of
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
light
and
very
dry
all
the
way
through
in
the
beginning
there
is
a
splash
of
fruitiness
that
quickly
gives
way
to
malt
and
a
little
hops
but
very
very
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
bitter
and
lingered
on
way
after
the
glass
was
done
overall
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
i
liked
the
500ml
bottle
serving
cool
looking
bottles
like
to
try
this
on
tap
some
day
im
beginning
to
rediscover
english
brew
and
this
ones
a
winner
pours
a
nice
orange
amber
color
head
that
leaves
some
lace
to
the
very
end
this
beer
has
a
nose
of
malt
grass
taste
is
mostly
malty
and
somewhat
dry
on
the
finish
i
dont
know
where
the
bitter
comes
from
very
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
14
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
dry
bitter
malty
and
fruity
from
the
english
ale
yeast
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
it
has
a
dry
finish
the
taste
is
weak
and
musty
this
is
similar
to
most
englishstyle
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
light
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
is
a
good
drinking
beer
youngs
beers
are
all
pretty
decent
you
almost
cant
go
wrong
notes
excellent
esb
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
a
special
bitter
though
the
massive
carbonation
reminds
me
of
how
much
i
miss
the
myriad
of
caskconditioned
ales
i
could
get
in
the
uk
the
hop
character
is
very
pronounced
throughout
more
so
than
most
traditional
english
bitters
i
have
come
across
the
overt
hop
presence
keeps
this
5
0
alcohol
beer
from
being
feeling
too
sweet
making
it
a
very
nice
session
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
1
finger
thick
offwhite
head
which
diminishes
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
medium
to
fine
bubbles
has
a
mild
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
smell
so
far
not
a
particularly
impressive
beer
although
this
begins
to
change
a
bit
with
the
first
sip
which
tastes
initially
of
sweet
malt
and
ends
nicely
with
a
drybitter
finish
somewhat
smooth
and
fairly
drinkable
nothing
particularly
special
but
a
nice
session
beer
i
passed
this
one
up
many
times
but
my
wife
brought
a
bottle
home
from
the
store
it
looks
nice
enough
light
copper
with
an
intially
foamy
white
head
that
dimishes
quite
quickly
the
smell
is
on
the
light
side
its
a
bit
sweet
smelling
and
the
hops
are
discreet
waiting
for
more
hop
bite
left
me
a
bit
disappointed
for
no
good
reason
i
tend
to
compare
youngs
beers
to
fullers
and
this
one
doesnt
quite
hold
to
good
old
fullers
esb
a
good
beer
from
youngs
certainly
a
beer
that
id
have
a
few
more
of
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
england
good
stuff
thick
white
head
subsided
quickly
atop
a
light
amber
ale
aroma
of
esters
and
swee
light
malt
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
at
first
which
moves
into
a
sweet
maltyness
and
it
then
impeded
by
a
harsh
iron
water
flavor
it
reminds
me
of
blood
a
little
bit
and
it
detracts
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
a
lot
finish
is
very
clean
with
no
hops
in
the
finish
i
have
had
many
better
english
ales
though
maybe
i
am
biased
towards
a
liking
of
less
authentic
english
ales
appearance
forms
with
a
copper
orange
body
and
a
frivilous
fluffy
cream
tinted
thicket
of
foam
on
top
that
begins
to
dwindle
leaving
even
specks
of
lace
as
it
empties
aroma
caramel
sweetness
with
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
very
nice
not
in
your
face
or
anything
just
completely
harmonizes
is
so
nice
taste
upfront
the
creamy
sweet
malt
profile
is
entwined
with
the
hop
bitterness
definitely
one
of
the
better
english
ales
i
have
had
in
awhile
blends
flavors
so
well
mouthfeel
medium
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
but
carbonation
is
dead
on
making
each
sip
nice
as
the
next
drinkability
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
again
i
wanna
try
these
samplings
on
cask
that
would
be
an
experience
im
sure
also
this
is
listed
as
an
extra
specialstrong
bitter
esb
which
is
not
incorrect
but
maybe
slightly
misleading
may
lead
one
to
think
of
fullers
esb
ram
rod
is
actually
more
of
a
pale
ale
strong
bitter
rather
than
an
esb
comments

i
thought
this
was
well
done
but
off
the
esb
style
pours
to
a
copperorangish
color
with
a
chill
haze
it
forms
a
tan
head
that
quickly
diminishes
the
aroma
is
wonderful
with
a
malty
floral
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
of
english
malts
caramel
with
the
floral
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
f
best
before
october
2003
drinkability
isnt
high
too
much
body
to
really
be
a
great
session
ale
but
lots
of
flavor
nonetheless
not
quite
so
sour
and
bready
as
some
other
english
esbs
very
drinkable
pours
out
browish
red
with
a
small
head
taste
is
slightly
sour
a
little
metallic
feel
to
it
some
hop
bitterness
but
well
rounded
body
is
not
that
complex
but
it
remains
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
once
in
a
while
beer
for
me
not
something
that
i
will
likely
keep
in
the
fridge
i
enjoyed
this
ale
it
is
not
one
i
will
purchase
frequently
though
i
do
have
a
friend
who
i
am
going
to
recommend
this
ale
to
overall
not
too
bad
for
the
style
easily
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
this
brew
has
a
nice
aroma
and
when
poured
yields
a
medium
white
head
of
medium
bubbles
and
an
amber
color
with
a
slight
cloudiness
it
has
a
pleasant
smooth
taste
with
only
a
slight
after
bite
it
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
allinall
it
was
a
very
smooth
and
a
nice
brew
to
sit
and
drink
all
night
long
pours
out
a
quite
hazy
deep
copper
colour
foamy
head
appears
and
doesnt
want
to
die
down
any
time
soon
fair
amount
of
lace
oh
i
like
the
aroma
lots
of
fresh
fruit
smells
coming
forth
from
my
glass
very
enticing
lots
of
ripe
fruit
flavours
in
the
taste
department
quite
layered
and
complex
in
the
amounts
of
different
flavours
shining
through
damn
tasty
medium
mouthfeel
props
up
the
malt
load
hard
to
discern
the
bittering
hops
but
there
is
some
balance
to
the
malt
sweetness
its
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
and
quite
the
tasty
and
refreshing
ale
certainly
this
is
no
monster
but
a
perfectly
crafted
balanced
easy
drinking
ale
with
plenty
of
flavour
to
keep
my
taste
buds
interested
this
is
my
idea
of
the
perfect
session
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
very
malty
on
the
palate
where
some
crystal
joins
the
maris
otter
lots
of
earthy
hop
here
as
well
as
decent
bitterness
could
use
a
touch
more
bitterness
for
my
taste
nice
chalky
mineral
taste
on
the
finish
an
excellent
bottled
best
bitter
bottle
condition
it
and
id
be
a
real
fan
a
pleasant
light
copper
hue
it
has
a
medium
sized
head
that
dissipates
a
little
too
soon
although
it
does
leave
a
ring
that
follows
through
nose
is
light
all
the
way
light
floral
hops
light
spices
light
hay
and
herbs
light
citrus
perhaps
mild
would
be
a
better
term
flavour
is
mild
for
a
bitter
as
well
and
very
drinkable
floral
hops
grapefruit
and
herbage
found
in
the
taste
an
impressive
ale
but
not
exceptional
although
looking
back
now
with
the
well
blended
mild
characteristics
i
should
have
scored
this
higher
just
not
bold
enough
for
me
to
up
the
ante
this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
copper
the
head
was
off
white
but
thinned
rather
quickly
while
the
head
lasted
there
was
a
little
lace
the
aroma
was
muted
with
little
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
also
evenly
balanced
with
the
slight
maltiness
winning
out
there
was
no
hop
bitterness
the
beer
tingled
the
tongue
with
just
a
litte
bit
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
light
all
and
all
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
i
was
hesitant
about
trying
this
ale
but
after
a
good
outing
with
the
double
chocolate
stout
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
poured
brown
with
a
tightly
compacted
head
wich
laced
the
glass
a
little
great
english
tasting
ale
and
surprisingly
well
balanced
good
malt
flavor
and
only
a
slight
bitterness
decidedly
english
in
flavor
and
a
good
selection
of
an
ale
started
with
a
crisp
but
mellow
malt
that
led
to
a
creamy
brown
sugar
there
was
light
minerals
and
wood
with
a
slight
hop
finish
that
was
very
pleasant
the
body
was
medium
to
mediumfull
in
texture
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
finish
a
great
beer
and
i
can
never
pass
up
a
caskconditioned
ale
its
been
some
time
since
ive
had
this
one
and
now
that
weve
been
reacquainted
it
wont
be
long
again
cherrytinted
bronze
hue
very
small
and
underdeveloped
white
head
spare
bubbly
retention
no
lace
a
crisp
malty
nose
notes
of
hops
slight
fruitiness
a
clean
aroma
with
minimal
depth
but
it
is
still
inviting
any
of
the
afore
mentioned
flaws
are
all
forget
upon
the
first
sip
oh
yeah
lovely
palate
surprisingly
sharp
bitterness
that
slices
quickly
through
the
tongue
the
gash
is
quickly
engulfed
with
a
lightly
caramel
malt
and
fruity
hints
sweetness
faintly
earthy
pleasant
finish
the
excellent
balance
continues
nice
lingering
hoppy
influence
superbly
drinkable
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
beer
is
a
classic
ram
rod
is
a
damn
nice
esb
recommended
had
this
from
a
16
9oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
dark
copper
with
about
2
fingers
of
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
a
deep
nutty
aroma
but
not
as
strong
as
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
a
sweet
nutty
flavor
not
very
high
in
hops
almost
a
hint
of
ginger
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
heavy
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
the
lace
large
rings
were
left
all
the
way
down
the
side
of
the
glass
very
impressive
drinkability
quite
wonderful
find
a
comfortable
chair
a
glass
of
ram
rod
and
a
volume
of
dickens
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
19th
century
everything
i
have
sampled
from
this
brewery
and
youngs
in
general
have
been
superb
and
ram
rod
famous
ale
is
no
exception
i
love
the
rich
amber
color
and
the
full
caramel
sweet
malt
body
pour
12
the
glass
at
a
tilt
then
let
the
last
12
pour
straight
down
to
create
a
full
lustrous
head
the
sweet
malty
aroma
has
hints
of
pears
and
tea
the
complex
hops
have
tealike
citrus
and
some
fruity
esters
the
velvety
smooth
and
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
is
a
pleasure
balanced
yet
complex
with
hints
and
traces
of
banana
milk
chocolate
pears
limes
and
cherries
this
is
a
must
try
had
this
at
just
a
random
philadelphia
bar
pours

taste

hoppy
with
a
fair
amount
of
astringency
the
sweetness
of
the

come
through
as
well
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
beer
has
supremely
well
balanced
malt
and
hops
flavours
nothing
really
leaps
out
and
grabs
me
particularily
but
if
this
stuff
was
cheaper
or
somewhere
near
me
on
tap
i
could
sink
this
stuff
like
nobodys
business
many
other
reviewers
have
complained
about
a
lack
of
bitterness
i
really
dont
know
enough
about
beer
styles
to
comment
on
this
but
drinking
it
as
a
person
inexperienced
with
british
ales
its
probably
the
best
ive
had
so
far
its
fairly
clear
copper
in
color
close
to
burnt
orange
even
mellow
is
the
aroma
a
little
malty
i
enjoy
the
flavor
lots
its
a
little
malty
and
a
little
more
hoppy
nothing
is
overpowering
i
almost
think
of
it
as
a
reserved

still
extremely
pleasant
the
taste
is

fades
into
a

a

on

has
a

poured
a
cloudy

with
a
very
thin

the
smell
was
transparent
and
hard
to
define
the
initial
taste
was
of
slight
citrus
woody
and
had
a
full
flavored
pale
ale
throughout
after
several
sips
a
nice
bitter
feel
a
very
drinkable
beer
somewhat
of
a
classic
english
pale
ale
i
will
look
for
6
packs
of
this
in
the
larger
markets
it
was
a
nice
amberorange
color
with
very
little
foam
the
smell
was
of
a
maltyhoppy
aroma
the
first
couple
of
sips
brought
a
malty
caramel
flavor
but
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
i
couldnt
taste
the
malty
caramel
or
spicies
the
sweetbitter
flavor
was
well
balanced
the
beer
failed
to
turn
me
on
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
what

with
a
very
even
creamy
complexion
midsized
head
that
leaves
consistent
lacing
along
the
glass
aroma
is
very
enjoyable
but
lends
itself
much
closer
to
a
mild
ale
than
that
of
bitter
taste
too
is
quite
mild
and
lacks
the
hoppy
kick
expected

dominates
but
hops
are
distinct
enough
to
lend
prickliness
to
the

a
nice
sense
of
light

a
huge

in
this
one
but
good
balance

this
beer
pours
with

clear
too
the
nose
is
lightly
malty
with
some

capped

the

it
quite
smooth

the
flavor

offers
broad

rather
than

somewhat
rich

only
lightly
caramel

a
supple

some
woody

and
a
leafy

flavor
thats
backed
by
solidly
supportive
bitterness
finishes
with
a
short
lingering
composite
of
the
above
characteristics
nicely
balanced
the
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it

so
much

recommended
a
damn
fine
ale
and
i
am
very
glad
to
find
a
place
that
has
it
on
tap
a
tasty
and
traditional
bitter
that
would
also
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
nice
find
on
tap
cloudy
tan
color
with
decent
head
and
excellent

the
aroma
was
big
on
malt
with
slight
hop
undertones
the
hops
came
through
in
the
flavor
however
but
they
were
well
balanced
by
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
is
only
slightly
beat
out
by
fullers
esb
but
a
damn
good
beer
in
its
own
right
another
pretty
good
beer
from
youngs
slightly
spicyherbal
hops
were
in
complete
balance
i
liked
this
brew
a
lot
but
for
the
price
a
would
go
with
a
fullers
esb
over
this
since
i
think
it
is
a
superior
beer
and
costs
about
the
same

my
area

i
definitly
had

it

this

would
be

what

its

very

it

with

slight

this
is

12

just
wouldnt

it
my
favorite
ale
with
the
exception
of
youngs
bitter
cask
conditioned
in
the
u
k
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
encourage
all
you
fellow
beer
lovers
out
there
to
try
this
fine
breweries
products
i
just
had
a
very
fresh
bottle
that
i
brought
home
from
the
shrine
a
beautiful
deep
amber
copper
nice
head
and
great
lacing
very
toasted
freah
malts
and
perfect
hopping
to
create
that
youngs
smoothness
a
total
classic
delicious
sooo
smooth
all
the
classic
english
ale
characteristics
notes
an
really
nice
bitter
true
to
style
we
almost
forgot
what
a
real
english
bitter
tasted
like
a
cloudy
amber
poured
into
an
ipa
glass
head
diminished
but
left
about
a
fingers
width
in
the
glass
s
nice
fruity
aroma
with
hops
coming
through
t
beautifully
balanced
beer
with
light
fruitiness
and
hops
in
just
the
right
proportion
hard
to
believe
it
is
over
6
bv
as
i
couldnt
detect
the
alcohol
coming
through
m
again
spot
on
with
carbonation
limited
enough
to
keep
a
smooth
almost
creamy
feel
o
overall
this
was
a
lovely
beer
which
could
be
a
great
session
beer
even
given
the
strength
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
my
favorite
english
ale
ahh
those
golding
hops
stars
with
a
ligth
bitter
taste
which
turns
into
a
comfortable
but
not
too
sweet
aftertaste
all
in
all
ill
confess
ive
not
always
been
blown
away
by
youngs
brewery
in
the
past
not
because
their
beer
is
bad
but
simply
not
that
memorable
either
this
is
a
clear
exception
and
well
worth
seeking
out
if
you
enjoy
traditional
english
ale
with
a
bit
more
omph
than
usual
i
do
like
this
brewery
but
this
surpassed
my
expectations
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
82
500
ml
bottle
it
pours
a
deep
golden
to
amber
colour
with
a
medium
head
that
leaves
both
good

and
lace

great
body
full
and

taste

really
good
good
straight
up
tasty
ale
o
overall
sad
example
of
style
tainted
overall
a
very
nice
ale
bitterness
is
present
in
a
classical
english
style
refreshing
beer
too
o
enjoyable
beer
very
nice
for
the
style
overall
its
a
nice
british
brew
though
for
something
this
strong
today
id
expect
a
little
more
hops
bitterness
o
excellent
drinkability
great
british
ale
recommended
all
in
all
a
very
balanced
beer
with
high
drinkability
but
with
lots
of
taste
excelent
beer
a
classic
impressed
with
this
and
how
well
it
has
held
up
especially
given
the
journey
was
saving
this
for
an
english
tasting
night
that
didnt
get
off
the
ground
been
a
good
5
years
or
more
since
ive
had
a
glass
of
this
and
even
better
than
i
remember
it
to
be
super
impressed
food
match
the
national
dish
of
the
united

fish
chips
no
wait
curry
overall
a
nicely
made
higher
profile
english
bitter
ale
reasonably
expensive
but
also
reasonably
brilliantly
made
o
i
passed
by
this
one
so
many
times
before
sampling
it
it
deserved
better
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
basic
for
my
taste
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
because
its
very
flavorful
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style

i
realize

is

this

really
does
not

any
risks
theres
nothing
offensive
about
the
taste
like
many
macro
brews
but
nothing
really
stands
out
enough
to
make
the
beer
special
either
its
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
in
a
perfect
beer
world
this
is
what
the
worst
macro
beers
should
taste
like
o
pretty
good
o
i
love
this
beer
and
it
gets
even
better
after
it
has
been
in
the
bottle
for
about
a
year
im
not
sure
id
call
it
an
esb
though
ive
always
thought
of
it
as
more
of
an
english
strong
ale
o
quite
a
nice
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
from
this
brewery
i
poured
as
gently
as
possible
resulting
in
only
wisps
for
head
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
smelled
of
honey
and
caramel
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thick
and
the
hops
were
long
gone
but
it
had
a
very
pleasant
caramelhoney
flavor
on
the
tongue
finish
was
relatively
sweet
with
the
caramel
flavor
really
standing
up
it
had
aged
well
and
i
enjoyed
meeting
up
with
it
after
all
these
years
od
meh
fairly
run
of
the
mill
didnt
jump
out
at
me
and
i
was
happy
to
move
onto
something
else
but
mainly
its
just
sort
of
blah
nothing
stands
out
its
not
particularly
refreshing
although
its
not
actively
bad
the
alcohol
is
evident
and
makes
it
somewhat
less
drinkable
than
it
might
be
otherwise
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
but
i
cant
see
much
reason
to
ever
order
another
one
hopefully
its
better
on
cask
or
tap
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
extra
strong

carbonation
is

than
i
would
have
chosen
but
not
by
much
d
a

tasty

i
was
very
suprised
that
it
took
me
so
long
to
review
it
mouthfeelthis
bottleconditioned
esb
has
much
more
carbonation
probably
from
the
bottle
conditioning
process
i
imagine
that
would
help
its
pairing
with
certain
fatty
foods
like
cheeses
drinkability
is
good
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
nuanced
offering
from
youngs
that
is
a
fine
way
to
enjoy
a
quiet
evening
even
at
6
40
you
barely
notice
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
dcomplex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
without
over
doing
it
a
good
balance
of
character
and
subtlety
notes
really
nice
balanced
beer
not
as
bitter
as
other
esbs
but
definitely
is
as
tasty
and
drinkable
as
other
ones
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
session
type
beer
though
lots
of
balanced
crisps
flavors
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
solid
beer
that
isnt
too
light
or
too
heavy
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
best
esb
ive
had
thus
far
d
the
more
i
drank
the
more
this
grew
on
me
got
better
as
it
got
warmer
a
little
bit
of

warmth
but
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
at

very
high
regards
for
this
puppy
my
friend
brought
me
this
beer
from
england
in
a
bottle
the
color
is
a
pretty
golden
amber
there
is
a
slight
cap
to
this
ale
and
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
very
nice
it
is
hoppy
enough
that
you
smell
some
floral
notes
and
the
malts
bring
out
a
nice
fruity
smell
also
there
is
a
slight
metallic
smell
the
taste
carries
some
of
the
same
smells
and
has
a
nice
bitterhoppy
finish
its
mild
in
its
carbonation
and
i
think
it
is
a
great
session
beer
served
at
55
degrees
farenheight
the
alcohol
seemed
to
dominate
and
for
me
this
was
not
a
good
beer
d
this
is
a
great
beer
that
definitely
should
be
sought
out
the
higher
abv
makes
it
less
sessionable
though
for
those
seeking
moderation
d
this
beer
was
not
bad
hoppy
enough
to
placate
the
hop
head
types
but
still
relaxing
filling
and
complex
enough
for
other
types
too
too
hoppy
for
my
personal
tastes
but
it
does
grow
on
you
a
fine
sipping
beer
nice
in
the
mouth
definitely
drinkable
a
unique
little
beer
this
one
plenty
of
interesting
herbal
hop
action
on
the
nose
which
is
hard
to
place
or
compare
to
any
other
beers
the
balance
on
the
palate
of
the
malt
sweetness
the
bitterness
and
hop
flavour
is
really
quite
cool
its
a
beer
im
happy
to
only
have
occasionally
but
its
be
a
pleasure
on
each
occasion
this
is
a
totally
well
balanced
brew
and
a
great
hops
profile
im
slowly
becoming
a
fan
of
these
british
esbs
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
good
bit
of
flavour
it
goes
down
relatively
smoothly
and
offers
enough
to
justify
drinking
it
50
cl
bottle
pours
clear
and
golden
orange
with
a

flavour
is

mainly
sweet
caramel

a
light

hops
note
appears
before
the
finish
goes
rather
dry
and
bitter
into
the
finish
mild
wood
note
too
not
outstanding
in
any
area
but
good
to
great
in
all
i
feel
that
i
am
underscoring
this
beer
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
ales
available
in
england
rivalling
fullers
for
the
title
of
best
extra
strong
bitter
overall
quite
enjoyable
id
definitely
drink
it
again
d
i
could
drink
this
in
the
same
way
i
drink
coopers
sparkling
i
e
all
day
a
good
drop
drinkability
yes
this
has
held
up
quite
nicely
as
i
hoped
it
would
i
dont
have
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
but
this
is
definitely
great
stuff
and
its
probably
great
fresh
too
drinkability
is
probably
the
best
thing
mouthfeel
is
perfect
carbonation
and
thickness
exactly
right
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
start
tomorrow
off
with
more
drinkabilityi
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
its
interesting
to
see
compare
it
with
a
non
bc
esb
it
went
down
smooth
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
cheers
i
wasnt
planning
on
submitting
a
review
for
this
because
its
an
older
bottle
of
a
style
thats
not
supposed
to
be
aged
but
it
was
so
good
even
5
years
later
that
i
thought
i
should
let
it
be
known
im
surprised
how
well
this
has
held
up
over
time
thank
god
for
bottle
conditioning
great
beer
this
one
fabulously
drinkable
despite
its
6
a
very
good
beer
now
one
of
my
favourites
drinkability
i
found
this
a
refreshing
esb
that
combines
a
good
malt
and
hop
element
without
going
too
overboard
with
one
another
its
got
a
smoothness
and
a
warmness
from
the
esters
that
is
inviting
a
must
have
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves
d
good
brew
with
a
nice
taste
smell
and
head
d
cannot
see
a
problem
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
considering
its
a
6
4
this
beer
felt
lighter
d
i
have
to
admit
i
found
myself
finding
it
hard
to
concentrate
on
reviewing
this
beer
because
i
just
wanted
to
drink
it
and
not
think
about
it
it
was
really
delicious
and
so
easy
to
drink
even
the
short
halflife
of
the
aftertaste
made
me
want
to
drink
more
i
guess
there
is
a
complexity
to
this
beer
but
it
is
so
well
balanced
they
have
taken
all
the
work
out
of
it
for
the
drinker
just
enjoy
it
i
think
you
could
find
yourself
drinking
it
down
and
forgetting
the
strength
dangerous
it
is
my
new
goto
esb
d
a
nice
treat
but
in
no
way
is
this
a
session
beer
alcohol
is
concealed
splendidly
and
at
6
4
this
is
an
extremely
pleasant
beer
to
drink
one
of
my
favorites
also
works
great
as
a
marinade
for
pork
loin
beautiful
deep
amber
colour
with
creamy
head
that
stayed
for
most
of
the
glass
there
was
a
fruity
aroma
that
was
quite
nice
but
spoiled
a
bit
by
some
disturbing
detergent
character
on
tasting
i
got
into
the
awesome
balance
of
malt
and
hop
fruity
and
yeast
but
there
was
that
soapy
thing
in
the
taste
as
well
i
know
my
glass
was
clean
and
rinsed
and
this
sample
was
within
the
date
stamp
so
i
cant
explain
this
no
other
reviewer
picked
it
so
think
it
was
this
sample
only
my
wife
picked
it
straight
away
other
that
that
it
was
perfectly
balanced
and
a
classic
esb
with
all
that
fuggly
goodness
carbonation
was
a
bit
higher
than
a
normal
bitter
but
perfect
for
this
very
drinkable
ill
review
it
again
for
sure
best
before
date
30112008
low
carbonation
mid
body
tastes
good
i
was
a
bit
nervous
because
the
best
before
date
was
a
few
months
ago
gotta
love
the
turnover
at
the
beer
store
would
like
to
drink
a
fresher
one
to
compare
this
poured
a
clear
amber
with
thick
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
salt
and
cultured
yeast
almost
like
playdoh
with
citrus
hops
and
a
light
nutty
malt
it
tasted
quite
different
like
copper
hops
with
hazel
nut
and
apple
cider
malts
with
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
it
was
fairly
thick
with
slight
carbonation
and
had
a
moderate
bittersweet
nutty
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
clean
ale
with
a
great
classic
flavor
very
nice
great
beer
classic
esb
this
is
a
beer
that
ive
always
loved
but
never
really
got
a
chance
to
review
until
now
its
a
fantastic
beer
at
any
time
of
year
ive
heard
some
scuttlebutt
about
it
no
longer
being
available
in
the
us
in
a
short
while
due
to
youngs
and
wells
trying
to
cut
cost
but
it
would
be
a
shame
if
this
gem
came
off
the
market
mfd
medium
bodied
and
slightly
sticky
definitely
worth
trying
d
very
drinkable
as
it
is
not
overpowering
in
any
department
and
has
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
drinkabilityi
would
go
back
for
more
ranks
right
up
there
with
fullers
esb
maybe
even
better
there
is
a
distinct
fruity
flavor
and
aroma
that
i
dont
really
remember
from
fullers
offering
a
great
beer
drinkability
not
a
bad
lil
english
ale
thats
certainly
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
quite
drinkable
and
sessionable
very
drinkable
great
flavor
low
fill
factor
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
6
of
these
no
problem
right
now
in
taste
it
has
amazing
deep
complexity
with
a
perfect
bittersweet
balance
and
plenty
of
malt
and
hops
in
great
balance
it
has
lots
of
light
zesty
fruit
with
citrus
plus
lightly
caramelly
malt
toasty
bread
pine
a
light
earthiness
and
consistent
flavour
from
start
to
finish
its
flavour
is
strong
and
complex
yet
clean
very
crisp
lively
and
extremely
satisfying
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
it
has
an
incredibly
fresh
quality
to
it
i
shall
add
though
that
i
have
gotten
a
couple
bum
bottles
however
thats
out
of
many
the
drinkability
is
great
it
is
smooth
and
floral
and
has
a
decent
abv
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
and
again
as
an
esb
great

without
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
all
the
makings
of
a
worldclass
brew
its
balance
is
perfection
overall
pretty
good
esb
that
i
would
have
again
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
tastes
better
because
we
are
reviewing
it
from
the
brewery
but
i
like
it
i
also
like
that
the
manager
introduced
herself
to
us
and
keeps
telling
us
stories
about
their
beers
shes
fun
this
brewery
is
fun
this
beer
is
fun
i
hope
the
next
two
are
as
good
as
this
one
cheers
pours
a
nice
amber
ale
with
some
surface
foam
and
a
spotty
lace
smells
of
amber
malts
some
metal
some
herbal
hops
some
hints
of
herbs
really
overall
nose
is
inoffensive
and
approachable
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
as
i
believe
an
esb
should
be
fine
work
dick
flavor
hits
with
well
steeped
black
tea
some
sweet
and
english
malts
and
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
sans
bitterness
nice
esb
flavor
medium
bodied
with
reserved
carb
and
a
semi
wet
finish
nice
beer
esbs
are
one
to
feel
good
drinking
and
drinking
and
drinking
this
has
that
unobtrusive
and
approachable
not
the
most
unique
but
thats
what
makes
it
good
wow
easily
and
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
ever
had
very
sweet
and
creamy
a
nice
hopbite
to
balance
it
all
out
overall
very
tasty
and
super
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
papaya
with
some
biscuit
malt
and
grassy
hops
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
full
of
hop
flavor
i
get
a
lot
of
juicy
orange
notes
but
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
negated
by
the
biscuit
and
toffee
malt
overall
the
bitterness
is
pretty
low
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
well
balanced
esb
very
nice
o
this
is
a
smooth
esb
that
could
benefit
from
a
better
mouthfeel
the
ramped
up
hops
are
nice
sure
but
an
esb
needs
a
corresponding
strong
biscuit
malt
which
is
lacking
here
good
beer
just
a
little
too
offstyle
im
glad
to
say
that
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
complex
caramel
right
up
front
with
a
country
white
bread
sweetness
following
up
the
hops
are
mostly
floral
with
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
earth
and
citrus
it
has
a
slightly
fizzy
moderate
body
very
easy
going
down
i
paired
this
lady
with
some
nathans
hot
dogs
with
a
spicy
horseradish
mustard
good
choice
for
cutting
the
spice
im
not
always
down
for
the
esb
but
tonight
i
was
and
this
hit
the
spot
d
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
much
i
dont
know
the
bottling
date
but
i
imagine
it
is
a
bit
old
since
when
i
picked
it
off
the
shelf
it
was
dusty
and
the
label
a
bit
wrinkled
i
think
itd
be
better
if
fresher
as
the
bitterness
would
be
more
present
than
the
sweetness
drinkability
at
first
i
thought
the
biscuitiness
in
the
aroma
was
going
to
make
this
low
on
my
list
of
esbs
but
in
the
end
that
characteristic
melds
well
with
a
crisp
strong
bitterness
and
a
wellbalanced
flavor
profile
i
could
quaff
a
good
deal
of
this
brew
d
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
in
fact
next
time
i
get
to
that
bottle
shop
i
am
getting
another
bottle
d
an
aggressive
pour
in
an
oversized
glass
may
be
a
good
idea
abv
is
manageable
not
much
in
the
nose
but
good
malty
flavors
and
a
little
more
floral
character

i
fear
this
beer
may
have
aged
too
long
to
be
worthwhile
it
just
wasnt
right
all
the
way
around
i
brought
it
back
from
id
2
months
ago
which
makes
me
wonder
about
its
history
before
then
it
hurts
to
knock
a
beer
w
this
great
of
credentials
so
badly
but
based
on
the
beer
in
front
of
me
i
have
to
i
finished
a
bomber
tonight
while
playing
cards
with
friends
this
is
a
very
nice
esb
with
molasses
and
toasty
malt
and
jammy
fruit
flavors
augmented
with
pungent
and
assertive
hops
the
wise
esb
was
definitely
malt
forward
but
with
enough
hop
balance
its
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
judging
from
the
gabf
awards
the
label
brags
about
its
been
a
good
beer
for
a
very
long
time
delicious
overall
really
true
to
the
style
and
not
bad
for
a
style
i
really
dont
care
that
much
for
i
love
bitter
hops
but
even
more
so
in
an
ipa
style
preference
doesnt
affect
my
judging
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
esb
though
i
am
not
a
fan
of
brews
that
use
an
excessive
amount
of
different
malts
md
both
on
for
an
bottled
esb
could
use
a
touch
less
carbonation
but
i
just
feel
an
esb
should
have
less
than
an
apa
d
a
solid
esb
one
that
i
would
gladly
enjoy
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
alone
makes
this
one
to
seek
out
an
enjoy
a
solid
american
version
of
an
esb
i
like
the
addition
of
american
citrus
hops
to
compliment
the
caramel
like
malt
nice
balanced
flavors
solid
very
easy
drinker
well
done

to

some

a
flavorful
session
that
hits
the
esb
style
on
the
head
a
great
interpretation
d
very
drinkable
esb
its
a
departure
to
the
hops
ive
been
drinking
nonstop
lately
this
esb
is
more
floral
fruity
than
others
ive
had
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
good
one
elysian
d
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
and
i
will
definitely
pick
up
a
few
more
enjoyable
american
version
of
an
esb
i
will
certainly
keep
a
couple
in
the
cellar
i
e
garage
the
body
is
full
without
being
heavy
drinkabilty
is
very
good
having
a
session
with
these
would
be
easy
overall
a
good
solid
beer
worth
trying
pours
copper
colored
with
a
thick
pancake
head
smells
of
earthy
hops
sweet
biscuity
malt
and
a
light
nuttiness
tastes
on
the
hoppier
side
with
even
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
in
addition
to
the
earthiness
the
sweet
biscuity
malts
are
very
well
done
and
classic
to
the
style
nice
long
finish
as
well
very
smooth
definitely
an
american
interpretation
of
an
esb
but
plenty
of
honest
homage
to
old
england
as
well
i
love
english
esbs
especially
the
southern
ones
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
them
like
the
old
gales
ales
gone
but
not
forgotten
this
beer
is
beautifully
balanced
all
the
components
strong
but
in
harmony
which
i
think
makes
esbs
the
hardest
thing
to
get
right
this
is
the
only
american
esb
ive
had
that
holds
its
own
with
the
brits
not
that
im
going
to
quit
looking
after
reading
other
reviews
i
fear
that
the
waitress
served
me
the
wrong
beer
i
liked
it
enjoyed
drinking
it
after
a
nice
softball
game
nothing
crazy
but
good

the

a

american

nice
with

caramelly
malty
sweetness
including
fruit
and
a
little
caramelized
toast
plus
peppery
leafiness
and
grapefruity
bitterness
the
grapefruit
taste
and
bitterness
are
a
little
too
strong
though
throwing
off
the
balance
a
bit
and
pushing
the
beer
in
the
direction
of
being
a
little
onedimnesional
with
the
other
elements
somewhat
fading
into
the
background
it
doesnt
quite

down

a

normally

too
often
nice
take
on
a

minimal

bittering
is
formidable
and
integrates
well
into
a
somewhat
feral
yeasted
tang

hop

for
a

emanates
gentle
sweetness
with
an
irascible
tug
of
bitter
cherry
largely
traditional
yet
successfully
challenging
to
ones

sensibilities
i
really
like
this
beer
it
looks
nice

drinkability
drinkable
bt
a
little
to
carbonated
for
my
taste
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
i
would
be
curious
to
try
some
of
elysians
other
offerings
this
bottle
may
have
been
bad
because
i
got
an
extreme
amount
of
head
when
i
poured
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
bitter
aroma
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
boat
load
of
english
noble
hops
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
well
balanced
malt
and
hop
taste
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
touch
of
toastedroasted
character
and
finishes
quite
bitter
with
some
grassy
hop
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
its
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
recommended
drinkability
this
was
by
far
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
ive
never
had
an
esb
that
was
this
hoppy
before
all
the
other
ones
were
too
subtle
in
the
hop
department
this
cool
beer
goes
well
with
the
cool
label
over
it
i
could
see
this
as
a
session
esb
why
because
its
a
top
notch
beer
its
not
expensive
and
you
get
more
bang
for
your
buck
with
the
22

bottle
this
esb
is
extra
special
in
my

this
is
a
must
d

and
very

too
a
superb
american
depiction
of
a
classic
english
style
d
not
that
familiar
with
this
type
of
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
not
entirely
high
but
it
is
one
of
those
that
you
can
drink
a
few
of
and
be
extremely
happy
with
the
decision
i
look
forward
to
trying

bigger
and
bolder
then
many
esbs
i
have
had
a
good
esb
used
to
be
my
favorite
style
ages
ago
when
i
got
deeply
into
craft
beer
at
one
time
it
seemed
every
micro
had
one
one
of
my
favorites
was
from
the
now
defunct
mountain
valley
brew
pub
in
ny
this
one
has
a
lot
going
for
it
really
not
much
of
an
esb
at
all
it
drinks
much
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
say
stone
with
a
big
hop
bite
immediately
dominating
the
biscuit
flavor
of
the
malts
it
pours
a
deep
red
not
much
of
a
head
smell
is
pungent
and
tangy
its
thicker
than
others
of
the
style
and
the
alcohol
bite
too
pronounced
to
invite
multiple
glasses
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
again
not
much
of
an
esb
flavor
notes
light
toast
and
malt
grainy
hops
provide
the
balance
and
quite
a
dry
finish
not
bad
decent
take
on
the
style
drinkable
everyday
kind
of
beer
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
ale
im
a
hophead
and
i
usually
think
of
esbs
as
an
ipas
little
brother
not
so
with
this
ale
which
had
a
character
of
its
own
highly
recommended
pours
a
clear
brick
red
copper
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
slowly
falls
to
a
layer
of
creamy
bubbles
a
solid
layer
of
lace
is
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
making
this
a
very
nice
looking
brew
smell
begins
with
sweet
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
earth
and
dirt
caramel
malts
and
nutty
aromas
tickle
the
nose
as
well
with
some
pepper
and
bread
to
round
it
out
taste
starts
off
with
an
initial
citrus
hop
bite
that
is
quickly
overthrown
by
crystal
malts
and
a
caramel
sweetness
midway
are
mild
nutty
flavors
and
freshly
brewed
tea
on
the
tongue
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
with
some
gritty
hops
and
more
tea
like
flavors
soft
creamy
feel
with
a
light
to
medium
body
the
carbonation
adds
a
good
amount
of
life
to
the
beer
as
well
very
easy
beer
going
down
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
night
thanks
rick
for
this
west
coast
treat
another
style
that
seems
to
be
slightly
overlooked
because
its
not
imperial
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
amber
with
a
nice
creme
head
the
nose
seems
subdued
to
me
and
doesnt
give
much
gives
a
great
even
and
bitter
flavor
that
carry
minor
grasses
on
the
end
feel
is
good
with
a
fairly
full
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
damn
fine
esb
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
d
a
bit
stronger
than
i
would
like
alcohol
wise
but
still
pretty
refreshing
drinks
pretty
good
a
bit
too
americanized
for
me
plus
i
was
looking
for
more
malt
depth
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
d
maybe
a
touch
fruity
for
me
but
pretty
solid
overall
different
label
than
the
one
posted
on
ba
also
states

a
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
and
some
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
backing
the
stronger
than
typical
bitter
hop
finish
for
an
esb
the
drinkability
is
extremely
high
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
bottles
of
this
in
an
evening
without
getting
bored
overall
a
very
nice
esb
with
a
nice
west
coast
twist
starts
with
an
orangereddish
appearance
with
decent
lacing
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
with
a
grapefruitlike
finish
that
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
this
was
such
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
and
its
a
shame
that
its
not
available
throughout
the
country
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
great
head
and
nice
lace
the
nose
is
very
malty
and
creamy
with
only
slight
hop
flavors
the
first
taste
is
real
malty
suprisingly
creamy
flavors
and
a
very
interesting
malt
taste
the
hops
come
around
through
the
middle
and
finish
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
thick
goes
down
smooth
a
very
drinakble
esb
good
offering
from
elysian
overall
an
amazing
beer
definietly
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
in
a
way
it
reminds
me
of
a
dry
irish
stout
ill
be
hitting
this
one
over
and
over
but
i
probably
wont
be
getting
any
smarter
ive
sold
this
beer
short
very
short
ive
had
access
to
it
for
years
and
only
bought
it
45
times
ive
even
gone
out
of
my
way
to
not
trade
it
with
people
because
my
memory
of
it
was
less
than
stellar
that
will
not
happen
again
the
wise
will
be
come
part
of
my
fridge
rotation
for
sure
really
a
nice
pnw
take
on
an
esb
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
tan
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
bitter
a
touch
of
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
nice
malts
kick
in
nice
bitterdrytoffeecaramel
finish
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
esb
would
buy
again
the
hops
and
carbonation
make
this
a
bit
rough
on
the
tongue
but
this
is
still
quite
drinkable
a
nice
sipper
and
almost
sessionable
overall
impression
delicious
beer
pushes
the
envelope
between
an
esb
and
ipa
if
were
being
picky
this
is
a
lot
like
some
of
the
bolder
pale
ales
out
there
but
its
got
just
enough
of
that
english
esb
character
to
convince
in
any
case
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
with
a
big
bold
flavor
that
anheuserbush
are
currently
advertising
but
not
delivering
seek
it
out
here
instead
reason
for
the
ab
angst
their
bud
commercial
playing
during
baseball
playoffs
is
ludicrous
think
of
the
best
beer
youve
ever
had
now
get
ready
to
top
it
are
they
serious
bottle
courtesy
of
ss
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
large
fluffy
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
nw
bitter
hops
is
dominating
with
some
nice
caramel
taste
is
probably
bitterer
then
the
style
would
suggest
but
who
cares
caramel
malt
is
present
and
provides
a
nice
balance
good
carbonation
with
a
full
body
d
a
beauty
to
sip
on
but
easy
to
gulp
too
rich
flavors
and
mouthfeel
and
hotlooking
in
the
glass
athena
i
feel
smarter
for
having
tasted
of
your
delicious
brew
may
i
have
another
pretty
drinkable
this
esb
is
tasty
yet
inoffensive
and
went
down
like
water
the
presentation
from
the
appearance
and
aroma
is
the
allstar
here
whereas
the
rest
is
forgettable
fairly
dark
cloudy
amber
hue
good
hoppy
smell
smooth
tasting
bitter
taste
lingered
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
back
upper
portion
of
the
mouth
excellent
esb
it
is
a
beer
i
will
drink
again
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
to
have
one
or
two
or
three
received
this
beauty
from
liquid
solutions
very
very
good

a
lovely
clear

frothy

come
out
mild

sweet
almost
caramel
body
rolling
into
a
sharp
mouthfeel
with
a
hoppy
finish
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
d
a
good
session
beer
on
the
strong
side
malty
but
covered
with
excellent
hop
flavors
bitterness
is
in
line
and
not
overdone
the
flavors
are
not
bland
but
interesting
and
this
is
a
beer
worth
having
since
it
has
enough
sweetness
to
give
it
balance
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
elysian
so
flavorful
so
balanced
and
oh
so
damn
drinkable
theyve
changed
the
label
and
the
newer
one
is
much
more
colorful
and
interesting
drinkability
is
quite
high
just
about
the
perfect
bittering
that
makes
you
want
more
rather
than
being
at
all
difficult
to
drink
i
like
a
glass
of
this
particular
style
to
be
clear
and
not
full
of
yeast
in
which
case
pour
carefully
as
there
is
quite
a
bit
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
not
available
locally
but
i
always
try
to
grab
a
few
when
in
seattle
overall
a
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
esb
that
would
be
great
for
everyday
drinking
i
think
this
one
would
be
really
good
on
cask

a
bright
orange
hue

a
small
tan

subsides

immediately
wonderfully
enticing

a
little

and
sweet
yet
also
dry

a
great
beer
for
sessions

strong
on

with
only
a
slight
malt
presence
detected
also
noted
some
dark
fruitiness
taste
is
exptremely
enjoyable
with
the
big
maltiness
nocely
balanced
by
the
hops
nice
full

very
drinkable
a
near
perfect
beer
a
damn
fine
beer
pours
a
dark
mohogany
with
layers
of
caramel
syrup
a
nice
frothy
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
throughout
the
session
the
smell
is
of
pine
and
slight
honey
and
citrus
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
citrus
and
deep
caramelized
malts
a
very
nice
well
rounded
beer
very
drinkable
on
any
day
easily
consumed
with
wishes
i
had
another
solid
across
the
board
wow
i
first
tried
this
in
my
ba
infancy
i
did
not
like
it
trying
it
now
almost
2
years
later
has
made
a
world
of
difference
the
body
is
a
gorgeous
amber
caramel
topped
with
a
creamy
white
head
nose
is
sharp
hoppy
orange
and
lemon
mingled
with

by
pleasant
hops
i
get
orange
pine

is
full
of
intricate
tiny
bubbles
just
a
lovely
beer
drinkability
another
fine
session
brew
from
these
guys
really
enjoyed
it
on
tap
drinkability
not
a
true
esb
but
a
glorious
quaffer
that
makes
you
thirst
for
more
thanks
to
cvschaller
for
the
chance
to
have
at
it
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
nice
rocky
white
head
with
sticky
lacing
everywhere
nose
was
mild
and
fruity
with
the
hops
taking
center
stage
taste
was
nicely
balanced
between
some
bready
malts
in
the
beginning
which
are
followed
by
a
fruitypiney
hop
zing
which
enhance
the
dry
mouthfeel
and
make
you
reach
for
the
next
swig
overall
a
very
strong
effort
from
this
brewery
which
is
a
local
favorite
for
me
btw
i
think
they
changed
their
bottles
from
the
one
shown
my
bottles
label
is
green
with
some
type
of
female
warrior
image
the
flavor
is
so
good
that
id
probably
chock
the
aroma
problems
up
to
it
being
toward
the
end
of
the
cask
will
try
a
few
more
times
and
see
if
i
get
a
fresher
beer
and
how
it
differs
drinkability

very
good
this
is
a
very
drinkable
esb
though
im
biased
toward
the
style
i
could
drink
these
all
night
pours
a
hazy
ruby
orange
color
that
is
topped
by
a
two
finger
thick
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
herbal
hops
and
fruity
notes
of
cherry
currants
and
raisins
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
but
quickly
moves
to
a
sharp
biting
hop
note
the
finish
has
a
solid
bitterness
to
it
that
comes
to
dominate
the
beer
i
was
really
quite
surprised
by
the
bitterness
found
in
this
beer
it
is
actually
quite
nice
i
just
had
to
readjust
from
my
initial
expectations
there
is
a
definite
red
currant
note
here
that
seems
to
be
hop
derived
as
well
as
notes
of
pine
light
citrus
notes
of
grapefruit
the
sharp
hoppy
bitterness
of
this
beer
really
dries
out
the
finish
and
makes
you
want
to
take
another
draught
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
begins
to
pick
up
some
sweetness
in
the
finish
that
is
a
mix
of
fruity
and
carameltoffee
notes
beer
is
good
happy
beering
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
definately
recommend
it
so
not
your
traditional
esb
but
more
akin
to
an
ipaesb
hybrid
and
for
that
it
is
very
good
very
drinkable
stuff
wish
i
could
get
it
in
6
packs
i
really
enjoyed
this
e
s
b
pours
thick
with
mininal
head
color
is
a
dark
mahogany
with
reddish
tones
smell
is
of
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
is
oh
so
rich
with
nicely
biting
bitter
aftertaste
great
mouthfeel
maybe
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
for
my
taste
a
topnotch
e
s
b
for
sure
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
beige
head
over
the
amber
brew
head
is
resilient
and
lacing
is
sticky
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
aroma
is
dominated
by
those
citrusy
hops
but
theres
no
denying
the
malt
presence
either
taste
is
reasonably
wellbalanced
with
the
scales
tipping
slightly
towards
the
hops
with
a
nice
grain
backbone
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
fitting
for
the
style
an
interpretation
of
the
style
that
is
to
be
appreciated
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
the
flavour
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
a
little
smokiness
and
a
delightful
subtle
hoppiness
backing
them
up
this
wasnt
as
strong
or
overpowering
as
i
had
expected
rather
i
would
describe
it
as
pleasantly
understated
this
is
a
english
bitter
done
with
a
pnw
flair
there
is
not
a
huge
use
of
the
typical
citrus
hops
but
rather
an
english
profile
with
the
flavour
cranked
up
very
complex
but
drinkable
this
is
much
better
than
the
dissapointing
ipa
from
elysian
goes
well
lots
of
food
types
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
i
really
like
the
label
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
ok
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
strong
aroma
of
noble
hops
with
some
slight
caramel
in
the
back
good
esb
aroma
the
flavor
is
right
on
for
a
good
esb
slightly
bitter
with
some
hop
flavors
and
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
nice
caramel
backbone
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
good
big
thanks
to
orbitalr0x
for
getting
this
for
me
this
pours
an
orange
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
about
a
finger
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
caramel
slightly
orangey
sweet
and
a
very
nice
pepperyspicey
noble
hop
damn
smells
really
nice
the
flavor
is
nice
and
mellow
with
a
slight
sweet
orange
with
a
really
great
peppery
hop
i
really
like
the
balance
and
the
hop
finish
very
nice
brew
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
nice
carbonation
i
find
this
to
be
a
highly
drinkaboe
everything
is
smooth
and
well
blended
i
do
like
it
d
very
nice
built
beer
it
has
a
good
hop
profile
with
many
dimensions
and
a
nice
sweet
malt
to
really
make
them
pop
i
wish
there
would
have
been
a
bit
less
carbonation
as
it
added
an
extra
fizzyness
that
got
in
the
way
very
good
beer
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
only
other
offering
from
this
brewery
that
ive
sampled
the
immortal
ipa
the
wise
esb
doesnt
quite
reach
those
heights
but
that
undoubtedly
has
more
to
do
with
my
preference
for
ipas
as
a
style
two
beers
are
hardly
a
comprehensive
sampling
but
if
my
first
two
elysians
are
any
indication
these
guys
know
what
the
hell
theyre
doing
big
spicy
hops
grapefruit
rinds
pink
grapefruit
juice
the
hop
burst
is
a
little
larger
then
i
expected
for
an
esb
but
theres
a
good
balance
in
the
ample
malt
base
warmed
to
the
upper
40s
this
is
at
its
best
strong
carbonation
kicks
the
grass
around
like
a
lawn
mower
immediately
liked
her
because
its
named
after
my
company
west
coast
micro
so
hard
to
get
out
of
here
amber
insane
amount
of
head
pretty
hoppy
bitter
i
could
drink
more
of
this
i
would
make
this
a

pours
a
great
clear
copper
with
a
big
fluffysticky
head
leaving
globs
down
my
pint
glasspacific
nw
aroma
of
pine
and
grapfruit
aong
with
some
underlying
nuttiness
more
of
a
hop
tilted
esb
very
resiny
and
herbal
with
a
sweet
caramelness
to
balance
out
the
hop
bitterness
keeping
the
hops
from
taking
over
to
much
nothing
really
bad
to
say
hear
very
nice
beer
very
northwest
highly
hopped
and
tasty
this
was
on
tap
this
weekend
at
redbones
it
poured
a
bright
copper
color
with
very
little
head
and
a
light
lace
very
fruity
nose
definitely
more
malt
in
this
than
other
esbs
ive
had
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
hopmalt
balance
more
hop
than
i
expected
from
the
nose
it
comes
across
as
apples
and
pear
flavors
along
with
a
nice
bitterness
medium
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
it
did
however
have
a
thinness
and
apparent
alcoholyness
that
wasnt
as
nice
all
said
pretty
enjoyable
but
not
perfect
thanks
to
skyhand
for
the
bomber
this
was
ok
to
have
a
pint
of
but
i
wasnt
moved
to
want
another
so
far
the
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
arent
bad
but
they
do
nothing
to
really
impress
me
this
esb
poured
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
offwhite
creamy
foam
that
coated
the
glass
thoroughly
the
smell
was
modest
floral
hops
the
taste
was
mild
floral
hops
up
front
followed
by
bitter
hops
which
were
nicely
balanced
with
malt
and
then
fruity
floral
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
and
slightly
astringent
with
medium
body
and
mediumlow
carbonation
this
was
a
nicely
drinkable
esb
not
bad
but
not
overly
outstanding
either
pour
was
of
a
caramel
color
topped
with
a
faint
head
aroma
was
very
faint
of
the
flowery
hop
sort
full
mouthfeel
nice
balance
of
malt
to
hops
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
one
i
really
needed
to
get
two
of
22oz
bomber
this
one
poured
a
fairly
clear
pretty
much
copper
color
there
was
a
decent
head
offwhite
but
it
dissapated
quickly
there
was
very
little
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mainly
grapefruit
hops
with
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
was
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
bitterness
a
pretty
decent
esb
very
nice
mouthfeel
although
the
mineral
treatment
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
very
drinkable
22
oz
bomber
with
classical
label
scheme
hazy
copper
pour
with
head
dissipating
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
citrusy
hop
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
invite
the
senses
a
bold
initial
bitterness
greets
the
consumer
then
gives
way
to
a
heavy
caramel
malt
all
this
supported
by
a
smooth
body
overall
a
hoppy
bitter
with
a
nice
malt
balance
flavorful
medium
amber
color
large
head
aroma
is
caramel
malts
fruits
cherries
and
spices
a
medium
bodied
esb
malts
are
nutty
fruity
and
sweet
hops
are
grapefruity
and
piney
a
nice
esb
its
bitter
enough
so
that
it
has
all
the
esb
qualities
but
it
has
a
nice
nutty
and
fruity
sweetness
it
very
smooth
for
being
as
bitter
and
hoppy
as
it
is
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
update

i
decided
to
rereview
this
for
2004
the
appearance
was
definitely
up
a
notch
as
the
tanned
head
forthed
up
nicely
held
well
and
left
some
great
lacing
the
aroma
was
much
bigger
than
i
remembered
it
too
all
it
all
it
came
in
a
few
notches
higher
and
im
glad
to
live
so
close
to
the
brewery
light
bronze
hue
with
a
slight
haze
mountainous
rocky
belgianesque
vanilla
white
head
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
rough
frazzled
lace
a
waft
of
juicy
citric
hops
with
an
herbal
tinge
at
first
in
aroma
ensued
by
token
light
caramel
sweetness
and
hints
of
biscuit
pleasant
pearish
and
minerally
esters
become
discernible
as
the
hop
oils
dissipate
flavorwise
an
initial
snap
of
sharp
but
clean
pine
laced
hop
bitterness
yields
to
stately
notes
of
light
caramel
malt
and
mild
butterscotch
judiciously
fruity
with
an
undertone
of
mellow
ripe
perceptibly
acidic
pear
light
bodied
with
a
passably
dextrinous
mouthfeel
despite
the
full
dryish
attenuation
and
overly
high
carbonation
expected
resiny
citrusy
and
herbal
hop
flavor
perhaps
from
ample
late
kettle
additions
of
columbus
finishes
with
thirst
inducing
drying
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
minerally
sulfates
the
wise
is
rich
in
hop
character
with
a
simple
but
adequate
malt
backbone
it
has
the
framework
of
an
ipa
but
with
a
british
yeast
ester
profile
quite
unique
and
certainly
highly
quaffable
malty
fruity
and
oh
so
sweet
a
complex
and
evenly
bodied
beer
with
a
soft
hoppy
flavour
and
feel
that
balances
out
the
malts
while
also
letting
them
do
their
own
thing
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
esb
deep
copper
hue
with
reddish
tones
straight
up
off
white
lace
that
sticks
to
the
glass
malty
fruity
and
mildly
placed
hop
aroma
mirror
of
aroma
in
the
taste
of
fruity
malty
and
a
hop
presence
that
balances
a
down
right
good
n
solid
esb
i
was
sadly
not
very
impressed
with
this
must
just
not
be
my
style
great
beer
not
too
heavy
i
enjoyed
this
one
not
sure
if
it
outsanding
i
had
it
from
a
bottle
this
time
i
will
rerate
when
i
have
it
from
the
cask
in
my
experience
british
ale
is
a
much
better
from
the
cask
than
the
bottle
im
willing
to
believe
im
not
familiar
enough
with
the
silly
to
be
fair
but
i
just
dont
like
this
overall
not
sure
if
this
is
how
the
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
just
tasted
like
unfiltered
apple
juice
to
me
which
usually
means
acetaldehyde
is
present
label
says
marmalade
fruitiness
but
again
nothing
but
apple
for
me
since
its
well
before
the
best
by
date
and
was
properly
stored
i
cant
give
it
a
good
score
2
75
paws
perfection
top
favorite
of
mine
didnt
want
to
finish
it
not
a
huge
esb
fan
i
either
like
or
love
them
fullers
i
love
it
has
a
nice
bready
taste
and
goes
down
fast
and
easy
just
like
an
esb
should
good
beer
for
those
nights
when
you
know
your
going
to
be
drinking
a
lot
of
beer
this
beer
has
a
shockingly
good
mouth
feel
to
it
a
smooth
and
crisp
feel
that
is
refreshing
its
hard
not
to
say
ahhhhh
after
a
big
gulp
substantial
bitter
thats
flavorful
nicely
bittered
had
this
on
tap
and
was
excellent
rich
and
refreshing
esb
definitely
a
classic
example
if
that
even
needs
to
be
stated
o
my
first
real
esb
not
bad
and
pretty
balanced
lots
of
malt
favor
with
caramel
and
decent
bitterness
a
good
esb
although
a
bit
higher
abv
than
i
prefer
for
the
style
for
not
having
this
fresh
its
still
impressive
and
enjoyable
it
seems
the
nose
takes
the
biggest
dive
with
some
time
on
the
shelf
and
thats
okay
because
it
still
drinks
well
ive
rated
ca
650
beers
and
this
is
just
average
in
my
opinion
real
ales
phoenix
esb
blows
this
way
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
can
see
why
it
has
won
many
awards
it
is
very
well
crafted
and
aesthetically
pleasing
and
delicious
i
definitely
recommend
trying
one
o
a
straight
malt
and
fruity
yeast
bomb
like
others
are
mentioning
overall
fully
bodied
beer
with
well
balanced
flavors
truly
a
blast
to
drink
o
one
of
my
great
regrets
is
spending
a
week
in
england
and
not
taking
full
advantage
of
the
pubs
andor
not
taking
note
of
the
experiences
i
did
have
as
such
i
expect
my
foray
into
british
beers
to
be
eyeopening
and
to
only
strengthen
my
regret
and
what
a
start
this
esb
is
sublime
the
perfect
pint
to
quaff
on
a
hot
day
or
to
put
down
next
to
a
warm
fire
consider
me
blown
away
pours
goldamber
with
thin
white
head
toffee
and
malt
in
the
nose
and
flavor
wellbalanced
with
a
mild
stylistic
bitterness
on
the
finish
overall
a
supremely
easy
to
drink
beer
strongly
recommend
this
definitely
sets
the
standard
for
english
bitter
it
is
delicious
full
flavored
and
consistently
enjoyable
overall
do
i
really
need
to
hop
the
atlantic
to
find
this
on
cask
somewhere
o
superfine
drinking
experience
here
lads
and
lasses
make
sure
to
find
your
way
around
to
this
yet
another
fine
ale
from
fuller
smith
final
thoughts
i
had
i
expectations
going
in
to
this
one
based
on
fullers
other
offerings
my
expectations
were
met
by
this
esb
with
all
the
upandcoming
breweries
these
days
its
nice
to
drink
a
beer
with
a
history
spanning
several
generations
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
o
could
be
improved
by
secondary
fermentation
in
the
bottle
overall
light
but
flavorful
i
could
easily
have
another
after
finishing
the
first
one
4050
a
very
characterful
and
sophisticated
beer
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
consistent
throughout
and
allaround
satisfying
the
structure
of
the
flavor
is
largely
well
balanced
pours
a
brilliant
deep
copper
with
a
lingering
frothy
cream
head
floral
and
lightly
fruity
notes
counter
a
light
caramel
malt
backbone
in
the
aroma
very
perfumey
flavor
echoes
the
aroma
with
a
toasted
finish
which
becomes
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
effort
that
sadly
is
marred
by
those
odd
notes
in
the
taste
amber
color
pleasing
malty
aroma
light
carbonation
slight
hop
bitterness
is
present
but
this
is
dominated
by
the
slightly
sweet
malts
excellent
body
wonderful
bitter
even
considering
this
was
the
usa
import
version
rather
than
the
cask
version
very
nice
malty
finish
with
some
hops
presence
interesting
fact
english
bitter
despite
the
name
is
not
particularly
bitter
all
of
the
american
bitters
i
have
tasted
thus
far
are
too
hoppy
to
be
a
true
englishstyle
bitter
o
very
well
made
and
this
beer
has
no
apparent
faults
very
drinkable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
beer
all
other
esbs
should
be
compared
to
nice
and
malt
toasty
with
enough
bitterness
to
make
my
exwife
proud
always
ready
to
try
another
esb
but
i
dont
find
them
particularly
bitter
or
interesting
and
id
move
in
direction
of
old
ale
or
strong
ale
as
a
preference
served
from
bottle
in
a
tulip
glass
the
foam
is
thick
and
it
looks
golden
yellowamber
the
smell
is
very
fruity
with
hints
of
blackberries
cranberries
and
a
bit
of
malt
the
sip
stick
to
your
tongue
and
has
some
delightful
bitterness
its
has
a
nice
full
body
and
it
simple
taste
a
lot
of
berries
malt
and
hops
in
a
great
combination
i
think
this
ale
s
one
of
the
best
i
had
in
a
long
time
ofirst
time
having
this
and
its
really
pretty
good
whenever
i
make
it
to
england
ill
be
comfortable
knowing
that
its
there
to
catch
me
052612
on
tap
at
beer
authority
nyc
imo
this
is
as
bitter
as
i
like
my
beers
to
be
on
tap
its
nice
polite
no
need
to
slap
me
across
the
face
to
get
my
attention
i
can
be
impressed
with
subtlety
and
this
one
did
just
that
wanted
to
try
this
for
awhile
as
i
was
thinking
of
brewing
an
esb
in
the
near
future
now
i
am
on
the
fence
again
poured
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
my
tulip
glass
nice
appearance
with
a
clear
amber
body
and
small
whitish
head
which
left
some
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
kind
of
generic
hop
bitterness
on
the
nose
it
also
had
a
bit
of
the
wet
cardboard
funk
on
the
nose
as
well
glad
it
didnt
show
up
in
the
taste
they
definitely
hit
the
bitterness
just
right
i
like
bitter
and
the
overall
taste
was
just
a
bit
grassy
and
light
nice
light
easydrinking
mouthfeel
quite
refreshing
to
the
palate
on
a
hot
afternoon
bit
lacking
in
flavor
overall
though
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
the
style
or
the
fuller
from
my
understanding
esb
should
be
a
little
lighter
and
straightforward
what
can
i
say
i
am
a
big
ipa
fan
this
was
an
ok
beer
probably
a
nice
beer
to
offer
to
someone
who
is
not
a
craft
drinker
who
wants
to
try
something
a
little
different
from
their
everyday
bmc
beers
overall
in
my
opinion
this
sets
the
standard
for
esbs
of
course
i
would
have
this
again
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
goes
down
easy
has
beautiful
sunburst
color
that
reminds
me
of
a
gibson
les
paul
hoppy
aroma
balanced
by
a
soft
caramel
smell
soo
good
taste
is
of
malty
goodness
along
with
grassy
hops
full
of
flavors
for
its
medium
body
low
in
carbonation
but
manages
to
keep
a
very
thin
head
on
top
overall
this
brew
rocks
i
can
see
myself
coming
home
from
a
long
day
of
work
and
having
one
or
two
of
these
pint
bottles
in
a
nonic
definately
will
be
buying
this
again
excellent
my
mark
out
of
100
is
79
o
a
good
beer
worthy
of
somewhere
between
a
3
75
and
4
00
on
my
list
nothing
mindblowing
but
if
i
were
in
england
and
saw
this
guy
on
draft
id
definitely
want
to
give
it
a
shot
i
feel
that
some
quality
may
have
been
lost
in
bottling
and
importing
poured
a
clear
brown
with
a
shortlived
white
head
the
head
lingers
on
though
and
leaves
nice
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
with
malt
tones
and
fruit
the
taste
though
is
more
developed
and
has
a
nice
interplay
of
malt
bready
and
fruity
with
a
subtle
earthiness
the
body
has
a
nice
full
feeling
to
it
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
from
the
hops
all
in
all
a
great
pint
of
bitter
and
example
of
an
esb
highly
recommended
on
cask
if
you
can
find
it
its
a
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
not
a
bad
ale
overall
solid
and
flavorful
o
another
archetype
from
fullers
a
near
perfect
pub
beer
the
beer
pours
some
light
creamy
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
copper
brown
that
is
clear
the
beer
leaves
very
little
if
any
lacing
the
beer
has
a
deep
luxurious
caramel
smell
with
some
light
hop
pine
backbone
to
take
the
edge
off
a
little
and
vanilla
notes
to
mix
things
up
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
a
weaker
vanilla
profile
and
stronger
hop
profile
the
hop
is
bitter
and
the
caramel
malt
dulls
the
hops
a
bit
low
carbonation
with
a
creamy
finish
overall
a
great
bitter
and
worth
getting
again
very
few
bitters
compare
to
this
one
its
just
a
ridiculously
flavorful
and
satisfying
ale
i
can
see
why
its
stuck
around
as
a
classic
o
wow
this
is
how
an
english
bitter
is
supposed
to
taste
the
malt
profile
is
bright
and
distinct
with
a
well
balanced
bitterness
that
tingles
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
it
finishes
the
complexity
of
this
beer
allows
you
to
pick
out
the
different
ingredients
which
present
themselves
in
a
layered
fashion
the
low
carbonation
that
is
the
hallmark
of
english
ales
allows
you
to
pick
up
the
complex
flavors
easily
this
is
indeed
a
perfect
example
of
an
english
session
ale
i
can
and
do
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
has
in
a
long
time
complex
but
easily
drinkable
this
as
far
as
im
concerned
is
the
definition
of
an
esb
i
might
babble
about
the
ratings
on
each
aspect
at
some
point
but
i
really
think
the
whole
of
a
beer
is
much
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
hopefully
this
narrative
inspires
someone
to
go
out
and
try
this
classic
for
the
first
time
do
pay
attention
to
the
freshness
though
it
does
decline
eventually
o
love
it
highly
recommended
on
tap
at
a
good
british
alehouse
if
they
know
what
theyre
doing
and
keep
the
tap
lines
clean
you
should
have
a
great
experience
overall
quite
a
decent
english
ale
but
the
flavours
a
a
little
muted
for
my
taste
not
sure
its
worth
the
cost
of
au85
a
case
of
12
x
500ml
2012
o
one
of
the
standards
for
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
for
being
a
point
under
6
and
really
keeps
you
wanting
more
despite
the
quite
simplistic
flavor
profile
probably
a
good
intro
to
esbs
if
youre
looking
for
one
chewy
caramel
candy
taste
in
a
beer
body
rich
and
flavorful
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
unobtrusive
hop
bitterness
warm
and
inviting
pours
dark
amber
color
with
a
half
finger
width
foamy
head
smells
like
apples
pine
and
freshly
cut
grass
malty
taste
with
slight
hops
at
the
beginning
followed
by
more
of
a
piney
hoppy
aftertaste
overall
a
good
beer
never
tried
an
esb
before
but
it
seems
like
an
english
version
of
an
american
pale
ale
it
has
a
more
malty
taste
though
would
definitely
enjoy
again
my
palate
has
changed
but
i
am
sure
id
still
be
able
to
drink
too
many
pints
of
this
from
the
cask
o
theres
definitely
a
bit
more
bite
here
than
in
the
assortment
of
english
pale
ales
i
love
but
it
also
touches
base
with
the
fruity
sweet
bready
malt
goodness
of
those
english
pale
ales
if
i
could
get
this
beer
in
my
hometown
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
often
the
english
pale
ale
is
my
favorite
style
and
this
nails
all
of
those
notes
with
that
extra
bitter
bite
everpresent
on
the
back
end
of
each
swallow
so
in
essence
its
perfect
overall
very
balanced
crew
between
the
mats
and
hops
i
have
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
over
the
years
and
many
more
in
the
future
too
o
quite
refreshing
nice
bitterness
without
being
overpowering
o
with
all
the
craze
being
insanely
hopped
beers
and
new
hop
varieties
its
a
great
change
of
pace
to
have
such
a
classic
absolutely
love
this
beer
a
classic
and
a
must
try
as
the
defining
example
of
the
style
i
expected
a
stronger
hops
bitterness
and
the
diacetyl
to
be
completely
absent
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
well
balanced
cheers
o
this
is
my
favorite
english
bitter
that
ive
had
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
general
it
is
really
drinkable
and
bready
and
lightly
sweet
would
like
go
to
england
some
time
and
have
some
on
cask
if
i
could
i
would
drink
this
beer
instead
of
water
to
stay
hydrated
this
had
a
way
of
drinking
that
grows
on
you
its
subtle
in
some
ways
the
fruity
quality
of
the
hops
was
terribly
pleasant
alongside
the
rich
but
easy
drinking
malt
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
i
am
happy
i
tired
this
one
overall
taste
excellent
never
had
a
fullers
masterpiece
before
and
i
gotta
say
im
sold
very
smooth
great
mouthfeel
and
a
unique
and
perfectly
crafted
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
all
definitely
recommend
this
one
tastes
good
smells
bad
overall
a
nice
beer
thats
full
of
flavor
thirst
quenching
and
one
of
the
better
esbs
that
ive
had
mf
well
carbonated
but
a
flat
mouth
feel
medium
bodied
dry
finish
4
light
body
full
of
sweet
fruits
and
some
chewy
malt
goodness
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
just
a
smooth
lightly
malted
brew
pours
a
translucent
amber
brow
with
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
beautiful
color
its
very
light
to
the
nose
i
cant
really
distinguish
much
of
an
odor
great
taste
its
sweet
like
honey
but
smooth
like
rootbeer
just
the
right
balance
smooth
and
light
bodied
there
isnt
much
depth
to
it
but
its
a
good
it
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
overall
its
a
great
light
bodied
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
a
friend
o
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
esb
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
simple
flavor
profile
thats
clean
and
crisp
nothing
about
it
is
very
exciting
its
just
a
simple
beer
done
very
very
well
overall
the
best
part
this
beer
is
that
it
is
that
it
will
quench
you
thirst
if
your
thirsty
in
a
flavorful
manner
but
retains
full
flavor
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
clean
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
wonderful
clean
hoppy
flavor
overall
very
nice
and
flavourful
clearly
underrated
by
most
bas
this
is
one
of
the
true
world
classics
i
was
fortunate
to
drink
it
on
tap
in
england
at
least
once
a
week
when
i
lived
there
but
i
find
that
even
the
bottled
versions
exported
to
the
u
s
retain
most
of
the
complex
character
that
makes
this
beer
so
great
i
marvel
when
folks
in
the
u
s
tell
me
that
they
have
had
a
better
version
made
here
each
time
i
try
their
favorites
i
cannot
help
but
think
it
is
national
bias
or
perhaps
that
this
beer
is
so
famous
and
there
is
some
kind
of
reaction
to
that
it
is
pretty
affordable
too
so
i
would
highly
encourage
people
to
give
it
a
shot
and
try
not
to
serve
it
too
cold
the
taste
has
that
bitter
caramel
yeasty
taste
that
i
consider
a
requirement
for
the
style
i
think
it
is
as
authentic
as
can
be
loads
of
character
that
sticks
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
helping
transport
my
mind
to
the
other
side
of
the
pond
right
now
but
i
could
drink
this
any
time
o
probably
the
second
best
esb
ive
ever
had
very
smooth
and
drinkable
light
noble
hops
great
grainy
toasty
malt
all
around
nicely
crafted
o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
readily
available
esbs
o
this
beer
is
great
in
its
subtleness
and
balance
extremely
easydrinking
but
every
sip
is
interesting
prost
lampertland
used
this
a
replacement
for
a
pairing
with
brats
and
sauerkraut
stood
up
just
fine
nice
color
smell
could
have
been
more
brash
on
the
mouthfeel
good
hoppy
flavor
adapted
nicely
to
the
meal
notes
of
caramel
drew
out
slight
sweetness
in
the
sauerkraut
which
was
cooked
with
apples
a
nice
solid
beer
beautiful
deep
copper
color
but
the
smell
doesnt
follow
up
and
is
fairly
faint
slightly
sweet
with
balanced
bitterness
just
a
shade
toward
dark
but
not
overly
so
the
malt
wins
but
not
by
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
good
nice
carbonation
but
nothing
very
strong
avoids
being
fizzy
bright
clear
copper
colour
and
thick
foamy
head
that
dissipates
slowly
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
begins
very
smooth
and
light
carries
a
rich
malty
flavour
with
metallic
and
subtle
caramel
notes
and
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
flavour
aroma
of
tangy
hops
and
honey
well
balanced

of
the
style

finish
along
with
a

body
thinnish
as
per
the
style
but
flavor
robust
distinctive
and
salient
some
dry
yeast
on
the
palate
to
close
a
must
have
for
traditional
bitter
fans
i
like
the
caramel
moutiness
in
combinations
with
the
piney
hops
this
flavoraroma
is
what
i
have
been
looking
for
for
some
time
in
american
dipas
and
boom
here
it
is
now
give
me
an
imperial
version
with
incredible
amount
of
hops
and
i
am
slave
pours
a
brilliant
copper
color
some
red
hues
a
slight
ruby
shine
reflecting
around
the
center
a
quickly
dissapating
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
that
doesnt
linger
the
nose
is
fruity
yeasts
and
breast
malts
tart
sourdough
bread

sour
apples
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
tangy

toasted

very
floral

finish
a
slightly
alcoholic
warmth
is
detected
carbonation
feels
very
appropriate
and
pleasant
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
and
slightly
dry
a
very
tasty
and
pleasing
beer
that
is
very
different
than
american
esbs
and
is
welcome
in
my
refrigerator
anytime
overall
just
above
average
in
my
opinion
as
i
wrote
before
im
sure
this
classic
is
a
good
representation
i
might
just
not
like
esbs
if
you
do
im
sure
you
should
give
this
a
try
i
will
not
be
returning
to
this
however
would
have
again
overall
this
is
a
huge
surprise
for
the
amount
of
character
in
characterless
genre
fullers
is
always
good
but
even
for
them
im
impressed
overall
a
wellbalanced
bitter
that
reminds
me
of
at
least
one
amber
ale
warm
and
cheerful
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
bitter
it
remains
the
standard
of
the
style
overall
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
its
simply
a
satisfying
solid
enjoyable
beer
no
flashiness
nothing
super
complex
and
theres
something
comforting
about
that
a
perfect
beer
to
share
and
enjoy
with
a
group
of
friends
in
a
relaxed
environment
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
belying
the
moderate
abv
just
a
tad
disappointed
there
was
not
a
more
distinctive
taste
for
accompanying
meals
however
thats
good
this
was
one
time
the
beer
surpassed
the
meal
by
a
significant
margin
overall
lives
up
to
the
hype
a
magnificent
quaffable
ale
perfect
for
summertime
overall
a
wonderful
beer
another
good
reason
to
be
an
anglophile
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
beer
is
a
touch
underwhelming
overall
excellent
beer
its
traditional
with
a
twist
its
both
unique
and
the
archetype
of
esbs
at
any
rate
pay
particular
attention
to
the
serving
temperature
as
this
beer
really
opens
up
at
slightly
cold
ambient
temperatures
o
decent
balance
i
like
the
bitterness
the
sweetness
hides
but
its
there
smooth
as
hell
this
is
a
good
brew
i
would
order
it
again
overall
a
very
drinkable
english
pale
very
specific
to
the
style
the
malt
favored
balanced
made
this
beer
sweet
and
delicious
perhaps
a
slight
addition
to
the
flavoring
and
aroma
hops
to
showcase
the
very
english
characteristics
of
earth
and
resin
but
definitely
is
still
within
style
parameters
great
beer
o
one
of
my
favorites
and
something
i
can
drink
anytime
anywhere

anyplace

overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
top
notch
esb
i
do
need
to
drink
more
as
i
have
only
had
a
handful
of
others
and
this
is
probably
the
best
that
i
have
had
save
for
some
local
boys
yards
that
make
a
mighty
mighty
fine
offering
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
theirs
this
beer
is
world
class
for
sure
and
it
will
garner
a
solid
4
25
or
better
from
me
it
is
so
easily
drinkable
and
the
only
thing
that
lets
me
down
in
the
least
is
that
i
dont
taste
cherries
like
in
the
aroma
big
whoop
as
much
as
i
love
citrusy
powerful
apas
and
aipas
i
love
me
a
welldone
english
ale
fullers
esb
is
a
wellbalanced
ale
that
i
highly
recommend
o
id
say
its
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
even
with
the
qualifiers
of
a
the
style
doesnt
tickle
my
fancy
and
b
i
havent
had
enough
good
offerings
of
the
style
for
it
to
tickle
my
fancy
in
the
first
place
out
of
personal
preference
id
much
rather
have
their
london
porter
but
just
in
terms
of
objective
quality
theyre
at
the
same
level
this
beer
looks
amber
with
a
slightly
tanned
head
the
aroma
is
estery
and
hoppy
working
very
well
together
the
slim
silky
body
relatively
wellcarbonated
for
the
style
has
hops
suitably
balanced
with
the
other
features
of
this
beer
the
aftertaste
is
neither
strong
nor
subtle
but
is
definitely
long
and
showing
a
hoppy
tone
what
an
excellent
session
beer
o
a
vibrant
and
smooth
bitter
that
starts
maltysweet
like
caramelcandy
and
finishes
with
just
enough
bitter
to
remind
you
of
the
namesake
but
for
me
the
sweet
remained
throughout
and
made
me
want
another
swish
an
interesting
note
is
this
beer
smelled
more
hoppy
fruity
scents
to
me
than
it
drinks
maltysweet
pleasant
beverage
indeed
o
a
nice
reacquaintance
with
an
old
friend
before
hoppy
ales
became
the
mainstay
of
micro
breweries
english
ales
were
always
a
favorite
and
fullers
esb
was
in
the
top
of
my
list
its
nice
to
try
this
and
feel
it
hasnt
changed
a
great
flavorful
drinker
with
malt
and
hop
characters
in
abundance
aftertaste
there
isnt
much
of
an
aftertaste
i
am
sure
this
beer
would
taste
better
warm
and
maybe
even
benefit
from
being
served
on
cask
but
this
is
1001
bottles
not
1001
draft
beers
maybe
that
should
be
our
next
project
anyway
this
beer
is
really
nice
easy
to
drink
has
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
at
the
start
and
finishes
with
a
malty
flavor
leaving
a
clean
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
coming
all
the
way
from
the
uk
i
am
impressed
with
the
production
good
work
fullers
update
i
noticed
later
that
the
bottle
i
drunk
was
6
months
out
of
date
an
outstanding
legendary
beer
a
must
try
id
forgotten
just
how
good
esb
can
be
overall
id
suggest
it
to
everyone
considering
getting
a
couple
or
even
if
you
arnt
thinking
about
it
its
got
character
for
days
i
wouldnt
call
this
session
beer
unless
the
session
involved
beef
stew
but
if
you
want
something
of
a
great
style
and
tastes
awesome
this
fits
the
bill
everytime
overall
i
actually
liked
it
better
this
time
around
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
esb
so
maybe
the
age
toned
the
bitterness
down
some
overall
it
shows
it
can
agree
some
and
still
be
good
fullers
esb
is
refreshing
balanced
and
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
ale
a
must
try
for
those
that
like
the
style
nice
beer
very
well
balanced
sweet
english
malts
with
a
refreshing
hop
flavor
you
got
to
taste
this
one
if
you
want
to
better
know
esbs
o
a
wonderful
bitter
that
can
be
found
most
anywhere
im
not
a
superhuge
fan
of
esbs
but
i
havent
really
had
enough
to
make
a
judgement
call
i
will
say
however
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
wish
i
would
have
tried
this
one
before
all
the
others
to
get
more
acquainted
with
the
style
this
one
goes
down
smooth
and
quick
high
drinkability
it
probably
wont
be
in
my
regular
rotation
but
its
still
pretty
good
overy
sessionable
and
well
balanced
in
fact
could
be
a
benchmark
for
balanced
ales
overall
sublimely
subtle
in
a
world
of
off
kiltered
beers
this
one
pours
up
a
deep
clear
amber
with
an
initial
off
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
nose
is
spices
some
notes
of
alcohol
and
grasses
taste
is
quite
interesting
it
delivers
a
huge
sweetness
up
front
moving
into
an
equally
huge
bitterness
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
very
full
although
there
is
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
a
worthy
offering
o
its
a
very
interesting
beer
its
bitter
and
has
a
kick
to
it
but
its
not
offensive
or
overbearing
always
like
to
try
something
new
its
really
good
if
it
comes
by
your
way
do
take
the
advantage
of
it
food
match
the
balance
of
this
ale
puts
it
in
good
stead
for
numerous
types
of
cuisine
be
it
a
spicy
thai
lemongrass
chicken
or
a
subtle
roasted
game
bird
with
roast
vegetables
a
versatile
variety
of
volitions
with
this
brew
the
worlds
standard
for
the
esb
balanced
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
pretty
tasty
stout
with
it
not
being
too
heavy
it
having
a
creamier
feel
and
nice
sweeter
finish
it
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
and
a
nice
beer
to
sip
after
a
meal
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
possibly
would
seek
it
out
for
a
six
pack
but
i
would
not
rush
it
overall
drinkability
very
good
i
will
try
more
from
fullers
the
taste
of
the
toasted
malt
of
fullers
esb
may
offer
the
finest
which
is
to
say
cleanest
or
most
obvious
example
of
what
beer
reviewers
describe
as
a
toffee
browned
butter
butterscotch
and
caramel
flavors
try
it
with
roasted
pears
or
apples
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
stuff
o
its
a
beer
and
a
half
one
of
the
great
mass
produced
english
ales
pours
a
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
short
lived
white
head
aroma
is
nice
good
hop
aromas
with
nice
malt
and
biscuit
character
taste
is
esb
all
the
way
up
front
maltiness
that
fades
to
a
strong
bitterness
with
lingering
sweetness
moderately
carbonated
with
a
very
smooth
texture
a
very
good
and
classic
example
of
an
esb
gorgeous
clear
golden
copper
color
with
a
short
off
white
foamy
head
mild
toffee
and
sorghum
aroma
pleasant
full
bodied
and
complimentary
mouthfeel
surprisingly
large
flavor
consisting
of
brown
sugar
toffee
earthiness
and
perhaps
some
banana
and
some
stainless
steel
age
at
the
finish
do
i
buy
again
in
a
crowded
import
market
or
not
that
is
the
question
o
its
ironic
that
one
of
the
seemingly
stronger
english
brews
is
almost
the
base
standard
for
alcohol
level
in
american
this
iconic
esb
is
quite
a
drinkable
session
brew
but
its
a
little
steep
costwise
12
a
6er
isnt
ridiculous
but
even
in
the
craft
world
i
find
it
a
bit
high
regardless
fullers
esb
almost
defines
the
esb
style
with
its
natural
burtonontrent
water
that
really
creates
a
standout
feel
with
this
beer
and
ties
the
malty
sweetness
with
moderate
earthy
hop
bitterness
nicely
my
pour
created
just
better
than
a
finger
of
dense
tawny
head
with
excellent
retention
it
was
making
me
wait
before
i
could
take
my
first
sip
and
as
it
fell
it
was
already
leaving
sticky
lacing
behind
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
the
shade
that
makes
me
think
of
some
of
my
former
redheaded
gfs
nose
had
a
butterytoffee
smell
very
soft
somewhat
sweet
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
definitely
toffeelike
on
the
tongue
finish
was
mellow
slightly
sweet
very
satisfying
i
must
try
and
find
this
in
a
can
o
this
was
probably
the
best
esb
i
have
ever
had
went
down
way
to
easy
odfinally
tried
this
forefather
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
it
was
enjoyable
i
have
found
that
a
few
of
the
american
interpretations
of
the
esb
that
i
have
tried
suit
me
better
o
i
havent
tried
an
english
ale
in
a
long
time
and
im
glad
i
did
the
subtlel
malt
sweetness
and
bitter
finsih
is
perfectly
balanced
this
is
a
winner
overall
a
commendable
esb
not
the
best
but
a
tried
and
true
original
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
if
this
were
on
tap
at
a
few
of
the
local
pubs
body
is
lighter
than
desired
just
lighter
than
medium
as
is
the
carbonation
some
alcohol
presence
after
the
swallow
drying
finish
and
a
bit
crisp
a
bit
bitter
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
even
better
on
cask
o
this
is
a
great
esb
would
like
to
have
it
fresh
vs
1000
miles
away
via
boat
d
beer
drinks
very
easily
nothing
to
sophisticated
here
comes
with
all
the
traditional
tastes
and
mouthfeel
you
would
you
expect
from
an
english
bitter
overall
this
is
an
exceptionally
wellbalanced
beer
the
flavor
is
crisp
clean
and
extremely
drinkable
o
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
and
am
wishing
i
bought
the
whole
six
pack
but
only
wanted
to
buy
a
single
because
i
didnt
know
anything
about
this
beer
i
would
have
this
beer
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
a
classic
english
esb
this
is
making
me
seriously
crave
a
hot
greasy
basket
of
fish
chips
o
while
this
is
not
my
favor
style
or
mixture
of
flavors
i
feel
obligated
to
praise
this
beer
given
the
type
of
beer
the
griffin
brewery
was
going
for
this
is
truly
spectacular
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style

i
remember
putting
down
quite
a
few
of
these
while
i
was
watching
some
premier
league
in
a
pub
in
london
quite
a
fond
memory
for
me
the
beer
has
enough
complexity
to
not
be
a
one
note
kind
of
and
a
very
nice
balance
happy
to
have
many
of
these
in
session
and
will
have
to
get
some
of
this
again
hopefully
in
london
and
on
tap
overall
this
is
a
really
great
esb
with
a
good
balance
of
bitter
and
malt
oall
very
nice
smooth
and
mild
you
can
get
several
of
their
products
in
quebec
the
esb
london
pride
london
porter
and
the
honey
ale
are
all
available
at
the
saq
in
ontario
they
sell
them
in
cans
and
are
much
more
reasonably
priced
which
is
where
i
got
this
one
o
certainly
passable
but
not
the
best
in
its
class
by
a
long
stretch
i
think
they
do
a
much
better
job
with
their
london
pride
offering
this
is
a
great
beer
to
accompany
a
meat
and
potatoes
type
meal
o
its
too
sweet
and
malt
forward
for
me
but
it
is
drinkable
in
about
6oz
portions
which
i
had
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
best
esbs
out
there
o
one
of
the
best
esbs
i
have
had
a
beer
thats
certain
to
please
everyone
excellent
special
bitter
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
an
esb
overall
a
great
legendary
beer
from
fullers
well
worth
seeking
out
today
was
the
first
time
id
had
it
in
a
quite
a
few
years
and
i
can
truly
say
we
wont
be
strangers
for
anywhere
near
as
long
next
time
o
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
i
felt
it
could
use
a
little
more
head
and
lacing
but
thats
minor
the
flavor
and
smell
of
the
beer
are
great
i
would
buy
it
again
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
rjt
o
a
delightful
english
ale
best
bitter
as
i
said
taken
a
while
to
get
into
theses
since
ive
been
in
england
nd
this
bad
boy
is
the
king
fullers
does
it
again
this
brewery
is
the
buisness
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
hop
with
a
sweet
gingerbread
like
malt
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
gingerbread
malt
and
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
end
a
nice
bitterness
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
hop
and
sweet
malt
in
the
aftertaste
an
easy
pint
with
a
small
hop
presence
o
very
nice
and
i
consider
this
one
the
standard
for
the
class
o
seems
like
a
beer
that
would
really
shine
on
tap
or
cask
a
nice
break
from
the
palate
wreckers
has
a
nice
mild
english
flavor
if
thats
a
thing
more
sweet
than
bitter
though
flavorful
drinkable
though
not
quite
on
the
same
level
as
the
london
pride
still
its
another
really
good
beer
from
this
brewery
o
very
nice
beer
easy
drinking
and
nicely
balanced
better
on
draft
dvery
drinkable
yet
complex
and
interesting
if
i
could
this
one
a
little
more
reasonable
and
fresher
i
would
probably
get
it
all
the
time
o
this
is
a
simple
delicious
beer
the
king
of
session
beers
in
my
opinion
well
i
will
still
rock
this
out
hardcore
when
back
in
the
pubs
but
over
here
i
will
probably
look
elsewhere
very
well
balanced
and
malty
compared
to
my
normal
beers
this
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
has
enough
going
on
to
mull
over
each
sip
but
extremely
smooth
and
inoffensive
enough
to
make
it
a
session
no
single
facet
of
it
stands
out
but
it
works
so
well
together
one
of
the
best
not
in
your
face
beers
ive
had
reminds
me
of
england
drinkablity
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
is
the
gold
standard
o
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
this
is
the
best
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
in
this
style
even
though
i
am
not
a
fan
of
very
bitter
beers
pours
our
a
medium
copper
color
some
minor
lacing
on
the
glass
bottle
says
best
before
sept
23
2012
i
would
guess
this
beer
is
probably
three
months
old
right
now
smells
is
slightly
faint
of
roasty
caramel
notes
and
faint
floral
earthy
grassy
hops
taste
is
more
dark
toffee
and
some
citric
bitter
hops
i
always
think
english
hops
have
a
more
earthy
taste
than
most
with
a
slight
lemon
citrus
aftertaste
it
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
malty
backbone
and
the
cleansing
hops
the
mouthfeel
like
a
lot
of
fullers
is
extremely
smooth
in
chicago
there
is
a
really
good
clone
of
this
beer
called
honkers
ale
but
this
beer
complete
with
the
soft
english
water
and
the
original
yeast
is
to
be
sought
out
if
you
want
to
find
the
standard
esb
overall
a
really
nice
drinkable
english
beer
overall
a
deceptively
potent
beer
really
packs
a
lot
of
flavour
definitely
obvious
why
this
one
gets
so
much
respect
fans
of
english
beer
would
probably
rate
this
even
higher
a
moderate
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
bread
and
caramel
i
also
was
able
to
detect
a
hint
of
orange
the
head
was
a
a
creamy
off
white
that
didnt
last
too
long
with
average
lacing
body
was
a
clear
amber
orange
with
little
noticeable
carbonation
had
a
sweet
caramel
beginning
with
a
dash
of
sourness
and
bitter
on
your
tongue
the
finish
is
lightly
sweet
and
doesnt
last
too
long
a
nice
brew
over
all
and
worth
your
time
o
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
good
stuff
here
not
an
all
night
drinker
but
a
damn
fine
beer
makes
me
nostalgic
for
fish
and
chips
and
arguing
about
the
queen
and
various
other
british
stereotypes
that
i
have
no
idea
about
o
this
is
fairly
well
balanced
maybe
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
that
could
just
be
my
american
palate
thats
used
to
being
slammed
with
hops
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
mind
you
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
experience
and
if
i
ever
am
fortunate
enough
to
find
my
self
in
london
i
will
absolutely
pop
into
a
pub
to
try
a
pint
off
the
cask
otherwise
i
think
i
prefer
the
american
interpretation
of
bitter
overall
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
in
hand
while
involved
in
a
good
conversation
that
required
little
attention
be
paid
to
the
beer
with
a
thorough
analysis
however
it
is
a
bit
uninspiring
if
this
is
the
model
for
all
esbs
they
should
stop
brewing
this
style
o
very
good
again
not
really
bitter
but
has
a
special
taste
doesnt
seem
as
hoppy
though
its
not
particularly
bitter
nor
citrussy
some
citrus
along
with
the
sweet
crystal
malt
with
the
ibus
makes
for
an
almost
marmaladelike
character
to
it
but
none
of
the
fresh
dryhop
sort
of
flavour
that
i
remember
in
the
bottled
version
tastewise
this
seems
like
an
excellent
session
beer
perfect
balance
between
smooth
full
malt
flavor
and
subtle
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
at
nearly
6
abv
though
i
imagine
this
ale
could
catch
up
to
one
in
a
hurry
considering
how
drinkable
it
is
a
good
esb
overall
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
esbs
and
i
do
love
it
brings
everything
you
want
from
a
bitter
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bite
to
it
as
well
final
grade
4
30
an
a
pour
orange
and
hazy
with
a
giant
tight
head
great
retention
lacing
with
a
nice
bright
cream
color
i
smell
apricot
and
peach
schnapps
and
some
dextrin
sweet
and
grainy
fruity
and
pale
on
the
palate
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hops
and
creamy
feel
like
the
smell
the
peach
and
apricots
are
really
noticeable
leaves
a
metallic
lingering
aftertaste
the
feel
is
furry
and
very
smooth
this
thing
just
feels
great
hard
to
describe
but
very
unique
this
is
a
classic
from
the
pour
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
is
always
enjoyable
great
representation
of
the
style
and
very
well
made
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
recommendation
from
a
brewer
friend
of
mine
who
keyed
me
into
english
beers
this
is
a
great
hoppy
and
malty
beer
full
of
flavor
very
refreshing
and
smooth
dont
let
its
reputation
as
a
strong
beer
fool
you
because
it
is
not
strong
in
the
tradition
of
stone
beers
overall
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
11
2oz
of
copper
beauty
topped
with
a
descent
cream
white
head
and
lacing
to
compliment
a
good
nutty
biscuit
aroma
with
hints
of
creamy
caramel
sweet
butterscotch
and
light
floral
hops
beautiful
up
front
is
a
strong
english
yeast
presence
mixed
nuts
caramel
malts
that
leads
way
to
a
drying
floral
hop
finish
with
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
soft
feel
and
slightly
drying
out
back
just
very
drinkable
this
is
my
idea
of
a
perfect
session
beer
even
though
it
is
5
9abv
i
could
definitely
drink
45
of
these
in
a
sit
in
this
is
one
to
go
back
to
for
sure
overall
this
is
the
classic
esb
in
my
opinion
an
easy
drinking
hoppy
ale
with
great
flavour
its
a
winner
every
time
for
me
overall
a
tasty
beverage
this
is
great
if
you
dont
know
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
as
it
toughes
quite
a
few
bases
great
with
food
o
overall
a
nice
esb
that
is
heavy
on
the
malts
worth
checking
out
and
something
i
would
have
again
mouthfeel
is
rather
full
bodied
for
a
sub6
abv
ale
goes
down
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
overall
quite
possible
the
benchmark
for
the
style
a
nice
departure
from
the
hopheavy
american
ales
comparing
this
to
american
esbs
can
be
unfair
this
to
me
is
the
quintessential
esb
in
the
world
pours
nice
copper
hue
with
decent
head
and
good
retention
and
lace
smells
typical
of
english
ales
lots
of
those
english
hops
and
malts
on
the
nose
very
pleasant
the
palate
centers
on
the
english
malts
with
that
faint
bitterness
that
is
well
integrated
nice
red
fruit
and
caramel
notes
texture
is
great
with
nice
thickness
without
being
weighty
and
fat
pretty
great
beer
overall
its
maybe
not
the
very
best
english
esb
but
its
a
worthy
yardstick
to
measure
others
by
this
pours
a
tan
auburn
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
on
the
nose
some
crisp
bittering
comes
through
what
is
otherwise
a
very
sweet
beer
this
is
a
crisp
clean
britishstyle
pale
ale
thats
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
and
sweet
for
my
expectations
of
the
style
a
very
enjoyable
english
beer
quite
balanced
and
easy
drinking
a
great
simple
sessionable
beer
a
perfect
beer
to
come
home
to
after
a
late
long
night
at
work
when
a
big
super
high
abv
beer
just
wont
work
a
classic
and
definitive
esb
o
a
tasty
beer
maybe
a
little
more
expensive
than
it
should
be
but
id
reach
for
it
again
at
the
right
occasion
o
im
not
experienced
with
english
beers
but
this
one
reminds
me
very
much
of
sammy
smiths
nut
brown
ale
and
its
a
very
good
satisfying
easy
drinking
ale
a
bit
heavy
in
body
which
is
nice
for
the
low
abv
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
it
is
one
my
standbys
it
pours
a
reddish
golden
hue
with
a
big
fluffy
head
and
rising
carbonation
that
never
quits
it
smells
of
malt
and
hard
candy
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
finishing
on
the
bitter
side
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
loose
carbonation
o
this
is
fairly
well
balanced
maybe
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
that
could
just
be
my
american
palate
thats
used
to
being
slammed
with
hops
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
mind
you
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
experience
and
if
i
ever
am
fortunate
enough
to
find
my
self
in
london
i
will
absolutely
pop
into
a
pub
to
try
a
pint
off
the
cask
otherwise
i
think
i
prefer
the
american
interpretation
of
bitter
fullers
esb
really
lives
up
to
its
semiiconic
status
great
beer
at
a
great
new
local
pub
o
what
a
beerwhat
a
great
simple
flavorful
beer
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
day
especially
if
i
were
in
england
i
cant
even
imagine
how
good
this
would
be
from
a
cask
if
you
could
put
my
love
of
british
beer
into
a
single
bottle
this
would
be
it
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
my
second
time
trying
it
the
first
time
i
was
not
a
fan
but
the
second
time
around
it
has
grown
on
me
as
stated
the
initial
bitterness
is
almost
to
much
but
it
finishes
nicely
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
hops
taste
is
also
very
well
balanced
malts
up
front
then
some
hops
kicking
in
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
brew
o
solid
esb
but
i
can
imagine
better
not
that
ive
had
it
but
one
can
dream
a
fairly
simple
beer
but
cleanly
executed
and
immediately
appealing
to
the
taste
at
5
90
and
wellbalanced
this
is
incredibly
easydrinking
to
the
point
where
i
doubt
id
notice
putting
down
a
few
while
having
a
conversation
at
a
bar
if
the
aroma
was
a
bit
more
inviting
then
it
would
be
improved
all
the
more
overall
a
good
beer
not
exactly
my
favorite
type
of
beer
very
drinkable
high
carbonation
nice
brew
i
personally
would
not
buy
this
one
again
i
think
my
preference
for
stronger
brews
makes
this
beer
less
impressive
not
knocking
the
beer
just
not
my
taste
o
great
esb
this
is
a
good
benchmark
to
measure
other
esbs
by
i
would
like
to
has
this
from
cask
taste
i
want
this
on
cask
in
london
before
i
meet
my
maker
i
need
to
make
that
happen
somehow
this
is
just
one
of
the
classics
no
other
words
about
it
this
is
the
beer
that
changed
it
all
for
me
wonderful
everything
from
mouth
feel
aroma
taste
color
if
this
beer
is
on
tap
anywhere
i
go
it
is
the
first
one
i
will
ever
order
ive
noticed
just
a
few
people
do
serve
the
beer
way
too
cold
so
sometimes
you
might
have
to
let
it
sit
a
few
to
get
the
true
flavor
out
of
it
do
this
beer
is
clearly
drinkable
and
i
am
quite
sure
when
it
was
released
that
it
offered
a
welcome
change
in
taste
with
its
slightly
elevated
hops
presence
overall
it
is
a
good
beer

this
beer
is
all
about
the

for
me
its
great
to
have
a
nice
drinkable
malty
beer
like
this
every
once
in
a
while
as
a
change
of
pace
from
highly
hopped
american
craft
beers
for
me
this
is
a
benchmark
for
the
style
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
more
of
malts
than
hops
i
get
some
caramel
toffee
and
a
little
floral
hops
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
good
i
get
the
caramel
and
a
little
hop
bite
on
the
way
down
overall
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
but
i
prefer
the
1845
or
the
porter
from
them
but
all
are
good
beers
othis
is
a
classic
beer
very
smooth
and
creamy
its
better
on
cask
but
from
the
bottle
it
is
still
a
really
quality
beer
cant
believe
i
didnt
rate
a
lot
of
the
fullers
stuff
before
some
of
my
all
time
favs
their
esb
in
cask
is
a
standard
wouldve
preferred
to
let
this
warm
a
bit
first
but
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
sized
cream
to
light
tan
fine
creamy
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
light
cover
and
some
lace
color
is
a
lovely
medium
dark
amber
with
good
bubble
trails
aroma
is
very
malty
caramel
toffee
a
bit
of
hops
and
fruit
flavor
is
similar
and
has
this
thing
where
i
almost
think
its
sweet
but
not
really
and
ah
there
it
is
lurking
behind
some
gentle
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
tang
to
keep
it
lively
body
is
great
and
so
is
carbonation
especially
for
the
style
although
again
much
better
via
cask
finish
is
like
flavor
and
tapers
quickly
but
actually
hangs
around
for
a
while
session
beer
extraordinaire
d
phenomenal
simple
yet
phenomenal
cant
wait
to
have
more
final
thoughts
great
beer
im
not
blinded
by
the
light
but
im
squinting
its
the
esb
so
you
know
its
done
right
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
with
the
word
bitter
in
the
name
very
well
blended
and
balanced
beer
will
definatly
recommend
to
others
overalldefinitely
worthy
of
a
top
esb
expected
a
little
more
bitterness
but
nonetheless
a
very
nice
drinkable
ber
overall
i
simply
enjoyed
this
offering
from
fullers
a
nice
drinkable
flavorful
beer
overall
its
been
too
long
since
i
have
had
a
good
english
bitter
this
is
a
real
treat
i
have
to
again
mention
the
balance
of
flavors
very
drinkable
the
beer
hunters
great
beer
guide
indicates
that
in
london
e
s
b
is
a
fullers
brand
name
rather
than
a
style
if
this
is
true
then
this
is
the
beer
to
compare
others
to
rather
than
the
other
way
around
it
is
arguably
the
original
and
this
beer
is
no
less
than
a
world
classic
appearance
perfect
smell
malty
clean
hop
nose
taste
just
like
it
should
it
is
an
excellent
balance
of
ingredients
including
the
amount
of
carbonation
i
imagine
that
the
only
way
to
improve
on
this
beer
is
to
get
it
in
london
fresh
o
there
is
quite
a
bit
going
on
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
more
complex
than
any
esb
i
have
had
deep
copper
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
dissipates
to
a
foamy
and
thick
ring
around
the
glass
that
sticks
around
the
entire
glass
aroma
is
sweet
honey
and
mildly
roasted
malts
tangy
fruits
are
also
present
as
well
but
it
is
all
malts
here
smooth
creamy
but
almost
thin
body
is
full
of
rich
malt
characters
mild
roast
caramel
and
toasty
bread
dry
but
crisp
finish
a
lot
of
the
hoppy
fruit
flavors
linger
but
they
are
subtle
so
smooth
full
of
flavor
and
with
a
finish
that
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
i
must
restrain
myself
on
this
sixer
a
classic
and
it
shows
d
very
nutty
but
good
complexity
between
the
malt
and
hops
good
start
to
the
night
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
probably
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
it
has
all
the
right
characteristics
of
a
great
beer
and
is
drinkable
any
time
of
the
year
overall
i
can
totally
see
why
this
is
a
favorite
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
can
easily
see
myself
getting
again
and
again
nice
to
see
something
so
vaunted
show
up
at
the
local
tjs
especially
given
their
awesome
pricing
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunrise
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
grass
flowers
light
orange
peel
very
light
cocoa
very
light
mild
coffee
minerals
and
a
touch
of
oak
the
taste
holds
notes
of
biscuits
mandarin
oranges
flowers
grass
buttery
caramel
light
wheat
light
banana
very
light
chocolate
powder
and
that
same
light
touch
of
oak
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
esb
clearly
worthy
of
its
reputation
now
to
find
some
on
cask
overall
this
is
handsdown
one
of
my
favorite
beers
on
earth
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
i
first
tried
it
from
the
bottle
which
was
quite
good
but
just
no
comparison
to
the
nitrotap
the
way
its
meant
to
be
served
o
solid
beer
and
i
would
buy
again
only
thing
is
next
time
id
want
try
one
that
is
fresher
overall
nice
brew
very
similar
to
the
london
pride
only
more
hops
taste
caramel
butterscotch
plum
sharp
hops
near
the
end
and
a
bittersweet
caramel
hops
finish
pours
a
very
clear
deep
amber
an
offwhite
rings
patches
up
the
glass
smell
is
a
blend
of
rich
fruitiness
and
rich
toasted
molasses
a
touch
of
straw
keeps
it
grounded
yet
complex
taste
is
a
lot
of
mediumcolored
fruit
and
something
that
i
can
only
descibe
as
agave
finishes
dry
and
bitter
feel
is
the
only
thing
left
hanging
in
acridboozeland
a
robust
esb
for
sure
fullers
scores
again
what
this
beer
lacks
in
complexity
is
compensated
by
its
overall
pleasantness
i
ended
up
drinking
this
quicker
than
i
expected
just
because
it
was
so
smooth
this
is
a
pleasant
strong
pale
with
gentle
yeast
flavor
which
is
mildly
pearapple
tinged
and
slight
herbal
quality
of
the
hops
giving
a
nice
balance
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
which
is
slightly
caramel
in
flavor
i
like
the
semi
toasted
note
which
keeps
the
flavor
form
seeming
sweet
and
the
tinge
of
woodiness
of
the
hops
adds
some
contrast
which
is
nice
the
ale
finishes
more
dry
than
anything
with
some
yeast
flavors
lingering
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
was
complimentary
to
the
food
without
overpowering
the
flavor
of
the
shellfish
i
recommend
this
with
dinner
or
on
its
own
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
12
inch
light
beige
head
that
fades
to

thin

lacing
forms
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
biscuitlike
malt
and
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
honey
and
a
very
nice
citrus
and
citrus
zest
hop
flavor
a
slightly
acidic
citrus
aftertaste
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
one
from
fuller
o
very
enjoyable
esb
i
would
get
this
again

nice
again
creamy
but
not
heavy
smooth
the
next
time
i
am
in
the
uk
i
will
be
all
over
this
o
a
very
solid
drinking
beer
which
i
imagine
would
be
heaven
on
cask
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
popular
this
beer
poured
out
as
copper
color
with
a
thick
looking
white
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
nice
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
not
much
else
really
but
had
plenty
of
malts
and
some
other
fresh
grains
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
and
had
a
nice
caramel
like
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
its
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
had
over
the
years
worth
a
try
this
is
the
beer
that
actually
got
me
into
import
beers
over
10
years
ago
esb
is
one
of
my
fav
styles
of
beer
that
many
american
breweries
dont
seem
to
do
anymore
pop
open
a
bottle
of
this
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
that
wonderful
smell
of
malt
and
hops
gets
me
everytime
but
overall
the
best
way
to
have
this
beer
is
on
cash
which
they
do
at
the
blue
anchor
in
delray
beach
fl
it
comes
out
with
a
wonderful
creamy
head
that
lingers
on
the
glass
and
leaves
nice
lacing
still
in
my
favs
of
all
time
this
beer
it
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
bringing
me
into
the
beer
world
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
pleasantly
surprised
again
by
this
one
not
as
bitter
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
it
is
well
balanced
i
actually
liked
this
one
although
the
smell
was
a
little
better
than
the
taste
overall
it
was
still
a
very
quality
brew
again
thanks
fullers
you
have
shown
me
that
you
really
do
actually
make
very
good
beers
rich
and
robust
this
beer
is
packed
with
flavor
and
a
very
smooth
drinker
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
overall
this
beer
is
not
very
complex
by
any
stretch
but
it
a
very
good
easy
drinking
well
balanced
with
good
flavored
beer
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
about
1011
years
ago
when
i
was
first
getting
into
craft
beer
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
now
i
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
but
just
a
very
good
go
to
beer
to
keep
around
for
an
everyday
beer
or
for
friends
that
arent
huge
into
beer
o
a
great
beer
with
a
nice
balance
that
you
dont
see
very
often
the
malt
and
hops
go
very
well
together
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
notes
i
am
a
daily
london
pride
drinker
but
not
so
much
with
the
esb
this
is
a
slightly
maltier
slightly
fruitier
and
slightly
more
bitter
version
of
london
pride
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
plan
to
drink
it
more
often
going
forward
i
never
understand
why
beers
like
this
always
come
so
highly
rated
here
on
ba
plenty
of
caramel
taste
and
flavour
smooth
and
a
little
thick
i
drank
one
cold
and
one
warm
to
compare
taste
niether
was
better
than
the
other
pretty
bland
really
overall
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
the
original
esb
very
good
beer
overall
good
to
the
last
drop
really
exceptional
one
is
hardpressed
to
name
a
better
proper
esb
el
puta
madre
really
hard
to
find
faults
in
this
one
overall
this
feels
like
a
good
solid
malty
thirst
quencher
before
i
knew
it
and
was
trying
to
figure
more
about
it
i
drank
the
thing
in
seconds
flat
guess
ill
have
another
someday
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
english
style
extra
strong
bitter
o
this
beer
is
simple
but
simple
is
not
always
easy
and
this
beer
does
it
better
than
almost
any
other
brew
excellent
balance
great
flavor
and
supremely
drinkable
just
a
good
everyday
type
beer
probably
a
little
overrated
for
all
the
hype
it
receives
its
better
than
most
massproduced
beers
but
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
i
can
see
why
this
falls
in
the
beers
of
fame
very
good
beer
worth
seeking
would
be
perfect
ice
cold
on
a
july
afternoon
great
sessionable
beer
o
an
easy
drinking
esb
and
at
5
9
abv
very
sessionable
drink
up
and
enjoy
the
fermented
character
comes
through
in
the
taste
interesting
but
not
great
i
have
a
bad
habit
of
drinking
beer
very
slowly
fullers
esb
does
not
stand
up
to
that
it
goes
flat
pretty
quickly
and
can
smell
and
taste
like
a
bad
macro
if
left
sit
too
long
so
at
5
90
abv
drink
up
cheers
can
i
have
another
love
pretty
good
stuff
nothing
like
a
good
esb
when
you
dont
know
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
poured
clear
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
receded
rather
quickly
smooth
malts
and
nuts
on
the
nose
malty
taste
with
some
toasted
bread
and
mild
bitterness
finishes
pretty
dry
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
not
too
memorable
but
nice
o
went
great
with
pizza
i
was
eating
excellent
to
quaff
alone
overall
ive
referenced
mead
in
this
review
i
love
mead
mead
is
far
sweeter
so
this
beer
is
great
its
so
smooth
and
drinkable
it
isnt
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
yet
it
doesnt
taste
simple
either
this
is
excellent
to
introduce
to
friends
who
dont
like
beer
cause
its
bitter
hopefully
theyll
get
over
it
hops
are
almost
nonexistant
but
thats
ok
this
beer
hits
the
spot
quite
nicely
od
quite
a
good
session
beer
what
i
recognize
as
the
benchmark
for
the
style
wonderfully
balanced
and
always
tasty
o
one
of
the
better
english
offerings
that
ive
had
thus
far
solid
beer
m
very
candi
like
robust
with
an
average
body
drinkable
but
filling
as
well
a
pleasant
beer
and
prototypical
it
seems
of
the
esb
epa
i
can
see
now
that
the
next
step
is
the
low
porters
o
this
isnt
bad
but
i
remember
it
being
much
better
o
this
is
my
first
esb
and
i
think
i
made
a
good
choice
been
focused
on
dubbels
and
tripels
lately
and
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
have
not
been
disappointed
by
fullers
yet
i
am
sure
it
will
catch
my
eye
again
as
i
scour
the
aisles
looking
for
something
to
slay
my
taste
an
excellent
strong
ale
smooth
and
tasty
wellrounded
character
with
an
great
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
ive
only
tried
fullers
ales
a
few
times
so
this
is
a
discovery
for
me
but
highly
drinkable
well
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
o
very
solid
brew
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
exactly
what
i
expect
an
esb
to
look
smell
and
taste
like
i
especially
like
the
dry
herbal
finish
o
excellent
beer
for
the
style
there
may
be
nothing
better
clean
crisp
and
straightforward
with
flavors
of
sweetness
malt
nuttiness
spiciness
and
a
bite
of
bitterness
o
fullers
e
s
b
is
often
touted
as
a
classic
and
quite
deservedly
so
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
brew
with
a
nice
full
flavor
with
a
solid
mouthfeel
and
its
highly
sessionable
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
defining
beer
in
its
category
but
it
could
certainly
be
better
this
is
a
really
good
beer
its
simple
balanced
and
true
to
style
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
the
london
pride
for
a
session
beer
but
this
is
a
nice
one
too
o
this
is
very
flavourful
and
balanced
more
sweet
than
bitter
compared
to
many
other
esbs
ive
had
and
it
works
extremely
well
this
would
be
a
delight
to
session
overall
imho
this
is
one
of
the
finer
english
premium
bitters
available
here
in
the
states
a
regular
in
my
fridge
and
a
very
sessionable
ale
even
at
5
9
can
never
have
just
one
or
even
two
or
three
overall
this
is
quite
good
dang
i
forgot
how
tasty
and
drinkable
these
simple
british
ales
are
ill
have
to
grab
a
couple
more
the
next
time
i
go
shopping
served
from
bottle
into
a
warsteiner
mug
poured
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
wheat
subtle
sweet
hop
and
slight
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
and
subtle
sweet
hop
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
esb
the
flavor
was
very
mild
and
enjoyable
definitely
didnt
have
the
dropkick
of
hops
that
im
used
to
and
i
was
quite
thankful
for
that
fact
this
really
made
this
one
easy
drinking
and
would
be
friendly
for
all
beer
drinkers
of
any
palate
design
i
actually
picked
up
on
a
belgian
influence
in
this
one
which
surprised
me
an
absolute
must
try
brew
that
seems
to
have
lasted
the
test
of
time
o
allegedly
a
classic
its
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
plenty
of
and
well
balanced
there
are
some
things
about
it
that
i
am
not
such
a
fan
of
almost
no
head
the
metallic
touch
that
being
said
i
find
it
a
decent
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
very
true
to
style
but
then
again
this
must
be
the
standard
take
home
scale
is
a
case
on
hand
at
all
times
i
really
like
it
and
will
hopefully
have
more
as
time
progresses
not
quite
as
much
my
favorite
for
pale
aleesb
is
why
not
higher
but
really
good
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
short
head
that
is
creamy
smells
of
fruit
bread
toffee
a
bit
and
some
hops
it
tastes
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
some
fruit
and
citrus
hops
getting
along
quite
nicely
and
a
bit
of
that
citrusy
hops
bitterness
lingering
at
the
end
very
smooth
which
may
def
have
something
to
do
with
drinking
it
off
the
cask
overall
a
great
standard
british
bitter
i
get
this
ove
rthe
pride
most
of
the
time
but
think
there
are
plenty
of
the
style
around
that
are
just
as
good
or
better
o
overall
if
youre
in
search
of
a
sample
of
a
proper
esb
this
is
something
you
should
seek
out
a
crisp
esb
with
the
proper
malt
and
hop
characteristics
to
please
even
the
toughest
critic
o
disappoints
as
the
sometimes
gold
standard
for
esb
still
amazingly
good
their
is
no
reason
not
to
have
this
one
on
hand
very
smooth
altoghether
nice
beer
to
drink
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
pretty
big
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
pale
and
english
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
caramel
and
hop
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
mainly
of
malt
but
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
after
a
few
sips
wow
this
stuff
is
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
i
havent
had
one
of
these
in
about
8
yrs
and
this
is
still
a
fine
brew
d
it
might
be
a
bit
strong
to
session
but
its
very
wellbalanced
and
the
lasting
finish
almost
begs
a
followup
pint
drinkability
the
balance
is
remarkable
making
this
quite
smooth
with
a
crisp
but
not
overly
dry
finish
a
true
session
beer
without
compromising
flavor
pours
a
brillantly
clear
copper
color
with
a
low
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
some
yeast
character
and
as
it
warms
up
more
fruity
esters
hop
bitterness
is
evident
in
flavor
and
balanced
nicely
with
the
fruity
esters
a
low
alcohol
flavor
with
light
mineral
notes
toward
the
finish
which
is
dry
and
lightly
lingering
there
are
some
nutty
notes
which
are
understated
i
would
love
to
try
this
out
of
a
cask
with
slightly
less
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
most
food
and
most
occasions
d
considering
this
beer
is
on
the
precipice
of
6
abv
it
could
make
a
nice
session
beer
very
nice
flavors
that
balance
quite
nicely
in
your
mouth
the
cpj
i
am
very
happy
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
as
a
real
ale
simply
delicious
and
i
feel
like
i
got
a
chance
to
step
back
in
time
its
good
but
so
grapelike
is
this
how
most
of
the
english
esbs
are
ive
had
others
that
i
liked
but
if
this
is
par
for
the
style
then
i
may
not
like
esbs
as
much
as
i
thought
i
did
d
a
delicious
brew
that
is
exceptionally
drinkable
half
litre
bottle
dark
ruby
colour
it
had
a
slight
haze
the
head
goes
fairly
quickly
grassy
smell
tasted
hints
of
applesome
wheat
the
bitterness
is
definatly
there
medium
mouthfull
would
like
more
than
one
even
if
its
too
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
an
english
classic
drinkability
this
is
a
beverage
that
i
would
be
happy
to
revisit
as
this
is
an
excellent
representer
of
the
style
the
beer
was
a
dark
copper
dark
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
it
smells
og
tangy
orange
with
some
roasted
toffee
undertones
when
i
took
a
sip
lemon
hit
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
tanginess
bites
at
the
mouth
then
some
roasted
malt
sweeps
through
its
just
a
bit
sweet
it
finishes
nice
and
bitter
the
beer
is
low
carbonated
and
full
bodied
at
first
it
juicy
but
has
a
snice
long
bitter
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
overall
this
is
an
impressive
beer
have
i
mentioned
that
the
taste
is
excellent
yet
a
bit
pricey
for
a
single
bottle
but
would
definatly
recommend
great
beer
overall
drinkability
a
solid
beer
this
could
be
a
regular
go
to
beer
it
would
be
a
very
refreshing
after
dinner
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
orangeamber
coloring
with
a
airy
white
loose
one
half
inch
head
the
aromas
from
the
beer
noted
while
pouring
were
caramel
toffee
a
slight
sour
tone
and
some
hops
the
caramel
malt
flavor
is
first
on
the
tongue
with
a
subtle
hoppy
background
to
help
balance
it
some
toasted
flavor
characters
also
the
beer
is
slick
and
smooth
in
mouth
with
a
crisp
and
light
finish
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
disappears
once
the
beer
clears
your
mouth
and
you
are
left
with
a
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
on
the
aftertaste
which
is
extremely
pleasant
this
is
one
easy
brew
to
consume
goes
well
with
anything
from
grilled
meat
dinners
to
pizza
one
of
the
best
bitters
around
rerate
cask
conditioned
at
the
blackbird
earls
court
london
copper
coloured
no
head
minimal
carbonation
moderate
aroma
with
malts
and
fruit
initial
mellow
flavour
then
a
dominant
but
pleasant
hoppiness
throughout
very
pleasant
to
drink
light
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
it
isnt
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
though
i
imagine
many
would
disagree
with
me
in
a
lineup
of
the
usual
draft
suspects
and
yuengling
lager
i
would
spring
for
this
again
though
no
doubt
in
my
mind
dvery
drinkable
im
looking
for
a
pub
in
the
orlando
region
that
would
have
it
on
cask
slightly
cloudy
copper
appearance
wonderful
caramel
smell
full
and
rich
flavor
with
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
highlights
plus
some
fruit
notes
peeking
through
very
drinkable
in
fact
just
by
sampling
ive
nearly
emptied
my
glass
one
of
the
best
of
the
fuller
collection
perhaps
second
only
to
their
vintage
ale
though
i
should
also
note
that
ive
noticed
a
bit
of
variation
in
this
brew
and
it
may
be
worthy
to
experiment
with
different
serving
types
temperatures
and
glasses
pours
clear
amberorange
with
a
thin
beige
head
aroma
pine
hop
lemon
caramel
light
grain
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
earthy
malt
and
floral
hops
thicker
texture
than
usual
for
an
esb
great
balance
juicy
malt
lingers
with
pine
resin
and
sweet
citrus
overall
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
my
first
esb
and
im
definitely
happy
i
started
with
fullers
id
recommend
checking
this
beer
out
drink
see
mouth
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
fine
carbonation
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
still
come
together
nicely
d
50cl
its
only
the
beginning
for
this
strong
bitter
perhaps
an
enlgish
pale
ale
despite
what
the
maker
says
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
if
this
is
what
true
english
beers
are
supposed
to
taste
like
im
surprised
at
how
accurate
american
versions
are
unfortunately
i
dont
this
for
sure
and
wont
until
i
go
to
england
and
have
one
there
myself
malty
and
slightly
sweet
at
first
sip
the
bitterness
kicks
in
at
the
back
palate
and
chases
the
ale
down

tongue
robust
in
flavor

has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
i
always
go
to
this
when
i
see
it
on
tap
as
it
never
lets
down
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
produces
a
one
finger
off
white
head
when
poured
aggressively
nose
is
decently
hoppy
with
notes
of
floral
spices
grassy
and
some
malt
taste
is
almost
like
an
amber
pale
grain
slight
maltiness
mild
bitterness
with
some
fruity
characteristics
kind
of
bland
light
carbonation
lighter
mouthfeel
and
bodied
it
has
some
appeal
to
it
but
not
one
i
am
likely
going
to
return
to
medium
drinkability
sure
you
can
drink
a
couple
but
the
desire
to
for
me
isnt
there
underwhelmed
d
very
drinkable
and
true
to
style
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
but
given
the
availability
only
1
case
available
at
the
distributor
and
above
average
price
im
willing
to
normally
pay
for
a
craft
case
i
dont
think
this
one
will
make
my
regular
rotation
schedule
anytime
soon
a
great
drinking
session
beer
nonetheless
cant
wait
to
look
for
this
on
cask
over
in
london
drinkabilitysmooth
flavorful
and
delicious
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
this
one
brought
over
on
a
plane
and
it
was
treated
well
and
very
fresh
its
a
lovely
blend
of
smoothness
complexity
depth
and
raw
flavour
great
beer
and
one
which
accentuates
just
how
good
the
english
styles
can
be
poured
from
a
16
9oz
bottle
with
an
ambercopper
body
and
2
finger
white
head
which
dwindled
to
a
thin
trace
of
foam
smelled
of
bready
malt
yeast
and
cold
etoh
also
slightly
metallic
taste
begins
with
a
slight
hit
of
alcohol
then
you
get
the
malty
presence
the
beer
finishes
bittersweed
and
yeast
is
tasted
throughout
feels
very
smooth
and
is
overall
a
very
good
esb
d
very
good
goes
down
like
a
charm
djust
okay
drinkability
great
beer
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
beer
necessarily
but
easy
to
drink
and
good
beer
to
start
the
night
on
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
easy
to
drink
given
the
sterling
reputation
of
fullers
esb
was
was
kind
of
disappointed
by
this
beer
it
was
really
sort
of
generic
tasting
and
seemed
to
have
neither
the
sort
of
bolder
flavors
that
might
be
enabled
by
its
relatively
high
abv
nor
the
subtle
pleasures
of
other
english
ales
ive
tasted
perhaps
it
wasnt
fresh
enough
to
do
it
justice
although
it
was
on
tap
at
the
same
bar
as
the
the
other
english
ales
im
comparing
and
if
anything
id
expect
a
stronger
beer
to
last
longer
a
very
nice
english
ale
i
had
this
on
cask
once
and
i
still
enjoy
it
even
out
of
a
bottle
theres
definitely
a
reason
this
is
considered
the
definitive
english
esb
i
especially
loved
the
esters
and
the
mouthfeel
simply
a
joy
to
drink
d
i
will
openly
say
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
its
right
in
my
wheelhouse
of
body
and
flavor
and
i
find
it
to
be
consistently
outstanding
mouthfeel
in
tingly
and
and
thin
it
had
a
nice
dry
finish
correct
to
style
drinkability
is
high
a
great
publican
beer
d
i
enjoyed
the
glass
i
had
and
would
consider
this
a
good
beeresb
but
it
doesnt
offer
anything
outstanding
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
it
more
than
any
other
good
beer
or
particularly
want
to
have
another
one
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
charlottesville
at
the
court
square
tavern
but
its
been
a
while
i
picked
up
bottles
recenlty
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
esb
at
home
however
i
recall
it
was
a
littel
better
on
draft
it
is
a
very
nice
rich
and
deep
golden
color
and
you
wont
find
a
beer
that
smells
any
better
the
aroma
is
truly
the
best
part
it
is
smooth
and
malty
but
carries
slightly
more
character
than
a
plain
english
ale
dont
shy
away
because
of
the
bitter
label
this
is
a
delightful
beer
and
great
for
entertaining
when
preparing
a
hearty
meat
potatoes
meal
d
definately
sessionable
a
quality
beer
but
not
quite
a
top
tier
for
my
taste
drink
probably
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ive
had
ill
be
buying
much
more
of
this
to
get
me
through
the
holidays
worth
seeking
out
d
tasty
as
hell
i
would
love
to
dry
this
on
a
cask
or
dry
hopped
d
this
is
truly
a
world
class
esb
and
a
paragon
that
has
defined
the
style
it
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
need
another
cheers
d
i
could
drink
a
few
but
they
are
a
bit
heavy
its
to
be
expected
with
the
style
but
this
one
may
not
be
quite
as
easydrinking
as
other
esbs
ive
had
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
recommended
a
very
good
rich
tasting
brew
the
sweet
malts
and
yeasts
on
top
with
a
nice
kick
of
hops
pretty
decent
balance
a
brew
worth
of
visiting
pretty
good
drinkability
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
true
session
beer
i
will
give
it
a
good
under
drinkability
because
i
really
want
an
other
smooth
ale
to
drink
very
enjoyable
and
one
of
my
top
10s
poured
from
a
solid
11
2
oz
bottle
with
the
best
by
date
and
abv
on
the
label
have
to
say
the
bottle
is
very
impressive
poured
a
nice
deep
clear
copperred
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
disappears
slowly
aroma
is
predominantly
fruity
more
along
the
lines
of
apple
juice
very
good
lacing
and
very
complex
beer
to
review
for
taste
starts
off
fruity
but
finishes
crisply
with
a
perfect
bittertart
aftertaste
taste
gets
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
very
good
solid

absolutely
worth
a
try
highly
recommended

drinkability
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
was
77
sekpint
though
so
i
didnt
i
would
guess
that
this
is
due
to
being
in
sweden
and
not
typical
pricing
drinkability
esbs
are
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
fullers
esb
is
fairly
drinkable
incredible
balance
even
the
high
level
of
alcohol
is
not
too
assertive
just
a
great
beer
to
drink
wish
i
could
have
hung
around
for
a
couple
more
pints
d
love
the
balance
of
this
beer
im
in
love
with
this
beer
d
very
drinkable
and
incredibly
well
balanced
if
you
find
this
beer
ontap
dont
miss
it
d
i
didnt
get
a
chance
to
check
the
freshness
date
but
it
seems
like
this
beer
was
past
its
prime
i
would
love
to
give
it
another
go
with
a
fresh
batch
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
to
pounding
them
but
with
something
this
sweet
i
might
not
want
to
anyways
d
would
not
drink
more
than
a
half
bottle
again
perhaps
on
cask
would
be
better
the
flavors
were
really
too
out
of
balance
for
me
the
abv
is
a
little
higher
than
what
id
prefer
for
a
sessionable
ale
otherwise
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
fresh
on
cask
this
beer
would
be
a
masterpiece
a
classic
of
the
style
for
sure
i
remembered
it
having
more
diactyl
to
it
but
it
is
far
from
bad
i
would
just
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
drinkability
this
is
one
extremely
tasty
and
very
quaffable
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
and
again
awesome
drinkability
tons
of
complex
flavors
but
the
best
part
is
the
delicate
balance
this
one
is
a
winner
in
my
book
drinkability
i
wish
i
had
a
proper
pint
bottle
rather
than
a
small
one
it
goes
fast
and
is
pleasant
enough
that
i
want
another
i
suspect
it
would
be
best
on
tap
or
cask
but
pretty
good
in
the
bottle
i
think
the
meal
i
picked
clashed
with
it
a
bit
pesto
pork
chops
and
mashed
potatoes
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
by
itself
an
all
around
good
beer
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
one
finger
of
light
tan
head
the
beer
is
amber
in
color
and
clear
the
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
toffee
malt
and
floral
hops
i
swear
i
get
some
pear
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
mostly
caramel
malt
there
is
a
slight
floral
hops
presence
that
balances
it
out
i
think
this
style
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
out
there
it
offers
nothing
offensive
in
any
manner
id
prefer
just
a
bit
more
bitterness
that
ive
experienced
with
other
samples
of
this
style
pours
a
bubbly
copper
head
hints
of
toast
caramel
malts
fruits
has
lots
of
malts
and
varied
sugars
with
an
overall
layer
of
toast
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
probably
the
best
esb
out
there
i
plan
on
drinking
this
many
times
again
drinkabilitygoing
through
the
six
pack
pretty
quickly
and
its
perfectly
sessionable
too
perfect
unfortunately
the
bottled
varietal
is
only
an
approximation
from
the
cask
this
is
as
near
perfection
as
a
beer
gets
ive
marked
other
beers
higher
but
sometimes
scores
will
be
false
it
is
pretty
silky
and
almost
a
bit
syrupy
in
the
mouth
but
just
about
medium
bodied
flavour
of
caramel
nuegat
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
a
chewy
finish
give
this
beer
an
enjoyable
warmth
and
a
nice
complexity
d
takes
a
hit
because
its
in
bottle
form
but
still
esbs
practically
define
the
session
style
for
a
pure
session
abv
is
a
little
high
there
are
better
esbs
but
theyre
probably
only
available
in
the
uk
on
hand
taps
d
nice
and
balanced
definately
malt
forward
but
there
are
enough
continental
hops
in
there
to
balance
it
out
classic
example
of
the
style
balance
its
the
measure
of
life
right
when
things
are
out
of
balance
they
miss
the
sweet
spot
in
the
middle
balance
this
beer
is
balance
drinks
well
nowhere
near
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
id
choose
this
over
many
other
beers
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
but
that
does
not
detract
a
bit
thin
but
it
kind
of
works
for
the
subtle
flavors
creamy
carbonation
suits
the
beer
well
hugely
malt
forward
kinda
right
up
my
alley
of
personal
tastes
totally
dig
this
beer
very
flavorful
and
a
flavor
profile
i
really
enjoyed
fullers
really
does
it
for
me
d
extremely
drinkable
it
certainly
disappears
pretty
quickly
as
i
want
a
drink
soon
after
ive
finished
my
last
one
the
5
9
seems
nowhere
to
be
found
im
quite
impressed
with
this
brew
and
would
love
to
try
it
again
as
an
english
strong
bitter
that
seems
to
be
quite
respected
in
the
beer
world
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
it
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
and
will
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
overall
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
profile
but
i
have
to
give
some
points
for
uniqueness
a
very
interesting
beer
thats
everywhere
and
often
overlooked
but
is
worth
a
shot
i
spent
the
week
in
england
last
week
and
of
all
the
beers
i
tried
and
i
tried
a
lot
this
was
the
strongest
its
funny
because
i
usually
dont
drink
beers
weaker
than
this
in
the
states
anyway
i
think
the
extra
alcohol
tends
to
balance
the
intensity
of
the
malt
and
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
brew
that
after
five
or
so
drafts
i
was
really
feeling
i
also
tried
this
in
bottle
and
enjoyed
that
as
well
11
2
ounce
bottle
pours
a
bright
orange
sort
of
the
color
of
fresh
rust
with
a
sturdy
foam
head
that
pocks
the
longer
it
sits
there
lacing
can
best
be
described
as
average
doesnt
stick
around
long
aroma
catches
you
off
guard
its
almost
sweet
smells
a
bit
like
freshly
baked
french
bread
malt
followed
up
by
an
interesting
green
apple
apple
cider
type
character
huh
wasnt
expecting
that
at
all
medium
body
heavier
than
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
with
a
good
level
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
guess
they
dont
call
it
an
esb
for
nothing
flavor
is
pretty
damn
impressive
complex
malt
washes
over
the
mouth
first
before
giving
way
to
a
refreshing
green
apple
looks
like
thats
what
i
was
smelling
hop
finish
malt
character
makes
the
beer
almost
sweet
but
it
never
heads
into
that
syrupy
area
so
many
others
find
themselves
further
drinking
yields
this
pleasant
earthiness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
bready
wow
after
just
a
few
tastes
i
can
appreciate
why
this
brew
is
considered
the
prototype
against
which
all
other
esbs
are
measured
my
only
regret
is
not
trying
it
sooner
fullers
esb
comes
in
a
sturdy
unique
12
oz
bottle
with
a
cool
design
and
raised
lettering
the
pop
top
comes
off
with
a
bit
of
hiss
and
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
toasty
with
hints
of
butterscotch
and
green
apple
the
ale
tastes
juicy
with
ripe
fruity
esters
a
crisp
woodsy
bitterness
and
thick
caramel
malt
the
beer
was
soft
on
the
palate
with
a
little
carbonation
and
chewy
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
with
very
little
carbonation
this
delicious
beer
is
easily
drinkable
all
beers
of
the
style
should
be
based
around
this
gem
fullers
esb
is
a
sunburst
orange
hue
the
beer
has
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
has
lasting
retention
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
about
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
english
malts
and
a
very
enticing
biscuit
scent
this
beer
has
a
terrific
flavor
it
is
very
malt
forward
and
remarkably
smooth
the
feel
is
fantastic
and
the
aftertaste
is
of
subtle
spices
and
malts
i
could
easily
enjoy
several
of
these
in
a
session
taste
again
sweet
and
dry
a
degree
of
complimentary
euro
hops
small
bubbles
typical
fullers
yeast
i
imagine
is
what
makes
this
work
minimal
citrus
some
breadiness
good
degree
of
bitterness
more
than
most
esbs
out
of
the
island
a
neat
beer
to
change
it
up
for
a
hophead
or
extreme
beer
guy
or
whatnot
the
beer
has
a
light
to
medium
body
its
quite
smooth
minimal
carbonation
in
the
mouth
overall
its
highly
drinkable
there
is
a
mild
aftertaste
overall
its
quite
good
this
was
just
another
random
beer
in
a
mixnmatch
sixpack
but
im
sure
glad
i
stumbled
upon
it
i
believe
this
is
my
first
fullers
and
the
quality
of
this
beer
even
though
its
supposedly
a
few
months
past
its
prime
according
to
the
date
makes
me
want
to
try
some
more
of
their
brews
a
definitely
recommendation
drinkability
the
mixture
of
the
pleasingly
sweet
initial
taste
and
the
nicely
bitter
finish
makes
this
an
excellent
esb

nice

the
whole
time
i
was
drinking
the
beer
i
was
trying
to
place
all
the
flavors
i
was
tasting
d
high
as
a
good
british
ale
should
be
light

with
a
touch
of

and
a
fizzy

esb
couldve

id
already
reviewed
this

love
this
beer

benchmark

bitter

the
main
feature
of
this
beer
mostly
caramel
malt
driven
but
some
floral
hop
aromas
holding
theirown
too
smooth
assertive
and
moreish
classic
an
excellent
beer
that
seems
to
be
overlooked
alot
to
me
it
drinks
like
an
incredibly
wellmade
beer
the
balance
and
smoothness
are
so
welldone
belongs
in
the
same
tier
as
ayinger
celebrator
and
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
picked
up
a
case
of
this
while
in
london
beautiful
clear
copper
pour
with
a
great
head
and
nice
lacing
huge
wonderful
toasty
complex
nose
with
dark
caramel
malt
up
front
along
with
butterscotch
tea
and
biscuits
the
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
and
complex
with
malty
caramel
butterscotch
brown
sugar
nuts
and
biscuit
combined
with
a
nice
subtle
hop
bitter
bite
on
the
finish
all
of
that
combined
with
the
smooth
fullers
mouthfeel
that
seems
to
be
present
in
all
their
stuff
make
this
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
world
class
drinkabilitythe
definitive
esb
and
a
great
english
ale
overall
very
drinkable
in
the
can
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
hardly
a
game
changer
on
tap
its
an
entirely
different
beast
dispaying
a
great
balance
of
flavour
and
an
excellent
consideration
of
both
the
hops
and
the
malt
not
only
is
this
a
great
esb
but
its
a
fine
advert
for
the
english
sensibility
when
it
comes
to
brewing
lovely
stuff
and
the
epitiomy
of
the
style
this
is
stronger
than
most
english
session
beers
but
here
in
the
states
we
like
our
chugging
beers
to
have
a
bit
more
muscle
and
this
definitely
fits
the
bill
probably
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
definitely
the
best
commercial
example
maybe
slightly
too
heavy
to
be
a
superb
session
beer
plus
i
never
wouldve
guessed
5
9
abv
but
this
is
a
real
winner
in
my
book
dont
care
that
its
not
bitter
since
thats
not
what
the
style
is
about
considering
these
guys
wrote
the
book
on
esbs
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
smooth
creamy
ale
with
a
moderately
bitter
finish
the
carbonation
is
very
soft
a
highly
drinkable
ale
one
of
the
very
best
bitters
i
have
ever
tasted
price
d
a
good
level
of
bitterness
with
a
crisp
carbonation
id
prefer
an
american
ipa
mostly
because
i
prefer
the
fresh
american
hop
flavors
more
but
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
refuse
drinkable
evenhanded
beer
not
an
exuberant
style
but
a
good
pub
kind
of
beer
d
really
top
notch
esb
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
would
pick
up
this
beer
again
for
sure
final
statement
enjoyed
the
beer
good
to
have
a
couple
of
but
would
not
repeat
all
that
often
dan
interesting
beer
all
in
all
sophisticated
and
doesnt
hide
behind
blandness
you
wil
never
forget
it
but
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
ofin
one
night
but
definetly
something
i
would
get
again
a
very
wellbalanced
brew
goes
very
well
with
robust
food
creamy
sweet
butter
and
english
toffee
blend
with
musty
fruity
hops
and
that
signature
uk
yeast
note
for
which
fullers
is
famous
toasted
malts
and
a
slight
nuttiness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
but
crisp
at
the
same
time
as
the
tight
carbonation
works
magic
on
the
mediumthin
body
all
in
all
a
delicious
beer
and
one
that
keeps
me
coming
back
time
after
time
not
sure
why
i
took
so
long
to
review
this
classic
but
better
late
than
never
dits
pretty
well
balanced
def
not
very
bitter
as
the
name
might
imply
and
leans
more
towards
a
nuttylight
caramel
malt
flavor
beer
than
pine
or
citrus
hops
some
people
may
get
turned
off
by
the
traditonal
english
ale
flavor
of
that
butterbutterscotch
flavor
that
indescribable
twang
but
its
quite
nice
overall
d
a
very
sessionable
ale
would
be
no
problem
to
drink
this
all
evening
this
goes
down
fast
and
smooth
especially
for
an
esb
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
like
but
it
coats
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
heavy
aftertaste
so
it
makes
up
for
it
top
marks
its
not
as
bitter
as
youd
expect
however
its
smooth
balanced
and
the
whole
drink
is
very
refreshing
i
might
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
and
rereview
d
i
think
this
was
a
very
good
well
rounded
beer
d
this
beer
reminded
me
of
fullers
london
pride
very
similar
to
me
just
bumped
up
a
notch
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
of
this
beer
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
i
might
buy
this
one
again
sometime
recommended
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
esb
this
does
taste
a
whole
lot
like
london
pride
though
just
a
little
punchier
as
of
now
this
is
my
second
beer
from
fullers
id
like
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
that
step
away
from
these
flavor
profiles
overall
great
beer
though
flavors
are
well
balanced
in
this
beer
with
slight
favoring
of
ale
fruitiness
malt
sweetness
is
cut
through
by
pleasant
hop
bitterness
just
the
way
it
should
be
d
just
from
the
first
sip
i
can
tell
i
can
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
d
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
not
hard
to
drink
it
quick
drinkability
for
a
beer
with
5
9
abv
you
certainly
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
this
can
certainly
be
a
session
beer
just
take
your
time
with
these
easy
to
drink
and
youll
want
to
continue
to
do
so
500ml
can
from
the
lcbo
identical
in
colour
to
the
abbot
ale
i
just
finished
a
deep
copper
hue
with
amber
edges
and
a
thin
ring
of
cream
white
head
spots
of
lacing
on
the
shaker
smell
and
taste
are
peaches
sweet
and
doughy
pale
malts
floral
hops
toffee
englishstyle
biscuits
and
a
citrus
orange
peel
bitterness
to
end
mouthfeel
is
soft
lush
thickish
medium
caramellike
a
little
juicy
and
resinous
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
one
of
my
favourite
fall
back
beers
when
theres
nothing
decent
available
at
my
local
liquor
store
in
my
mind
fullers
is
synonymous
with
reliable
high
quality
session
beers
thank
god
they
export
to
ontario
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
strong
candidate
for
a
session
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
and
so
good
that
youll
want
more
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
out
again
somebody
recommend
an
american
made
ale
that
tastes
like
this
lordy
its
good
drinkability
without
the
label
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
if
i
was
drinking
esb
or
london
pride
esb
is
just
a
tiny
bit
hoppier
and
a
tiny
bit
bitterer
but
other
than
that
the
experience
is
much
the
same
no
doubt
its
the
original
esb
but
fullers
gave
birth
to
a
watered
down
little
brother
boo
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
d
this
beer
does
not
put
on
airs
it
comfortable
like
a
cotton
sweater
sessionable
but
not
shallow
drinkability
the
word
drinkability
was
made
for
a
beer
like
this
absolutely
a
world
class
beer
for
sessioning
despite
slightly
high
alcohol
level
balance
balance
balance
just
superb
this
is
the
prototype
for
the
esb
style
and
i
cant
see
my
self
reaching
for
any
other
esb
over
this
one
just
superb
the
nose
was
fairly
mild
but
maltdominant
sweet
with
slight
undertone
of
bitter
hops
the
taste
nice
and
malty
caramel
raisiny
with
a
bitter
edge
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
spice
overall
a
balanced
beverage
extremely
enjoyable
smooth
light
refreshing
excellent
drinkability
i
had
to
refrain
from
chugging
this
bad
boy
a
definite
session
beer
as
the
bottle
says
its
the
original
i
feel
its
the
standard
by
which
other
or
american
esbs
should
be
measured
ill
admit
that
until
now
ive
sampled
and
enjoyed
mostly
bitters
by
midatlantic
breweries
flying
fish
yards
stoudts
etc
ive
had
a
few
english
bitters
here
and
abroad
and
its
tough
to
mistake
the
smoothness
and
mouthfeel
of
an
english
ale
the
fullers
esb
is
quite
representative
of
its
breed
if
you
want
a
detailed
description
of
the
nuances
of
its
flavor
check
some
other
reviews
below
i
felt
it
necessary
to
just
suggest
where
it
stood
among
the
others
thats
all
this
is
a
really
good
esb
and
in
the
future
i
will
compare
other
esbs
to
this
fine
offering
from
fullers
good
stuff
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
falls
back
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
the
sweet
biscutty
malt
nose
is
inviting
the
flavor
rolls
softly
across
the
toungue
soft
buttery
malts
caramel
sweetness
and
a
finish
of
hop
bitterness
to
perk
the
nose
softly
carbonated
and
easy
on
the
palate
i
could
drink
this
all
night
pleasant
soft
carbonation
that
is
typical
of
english
brews
makes
this
all
the
more
drinkable
is
a
nicely
balanced
choice
to
put
back
in
quanitity
except
for
the
slightly
high
abv
for
a
session
beer
dthis
has
a
great
balance
with
malt
and
hop
more
bitterenss
than
i
am
accustomed
too
but
it
seems
to
work
pretty
well
solid
beer
drinkability
enjoyable
drinking
experience
smooth
and
satisfying
has
a
high
abv
but
alchohol
certainly
doesnt
overpower
poured
a
dark
redorange
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
that
dwindled
to
a
ring
rather
quickly
continued
bubbles
throughout
the
drink
aroma
was
a
mix
of
butter
and
malts
taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma
definitely
a
strong
malty
character
to
it
flavored
with
a
buttery
biscuit
taste
it
also
had
a
slight
kick
to
it
as
well
well
carbonated
and
great

wonderful
taste
and
perfect
amount
of
body
which
means
i
could
have
one
of
these
anytime

that
mostly
lasted
with

aroma

with
tones
of

and

session
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
beers
a
session
beer
there
flavor
is
light
but
good
and
has
a
pretty
low
alcohol
ive
had
this
on
cask
in
london
and
preferred
it
but
it
is
still
nice
in
the
can
cheers
a
quite
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
refreshing
yet
warming
and
interesting
drink
pours
nicely
with
a
copper
color
and
decent
head
but
the
head
does
not
last
long
well
balanced
bitterness
to
go
with
the
maltiness
the
hops
give
a
slight
citrusy
flavor
and
aroma
but
are
not
overpowering
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
low
levels
of
carbonation
mediumbodied
with
very
little
carbonation
this
delicious
beer
is
easily
drinkable
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
very
lively
dissipating
white
head
the
smell
is
yummy
dominated
by
strong
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
caramel
chocolate
and
bitter
light
and
nice
a
bit
watery
and
short
though
nothing
really
lingers
on
the
palate
pretty
good
for
the
style
still
but
its
not
admiral
lord
nelson
d
ive
read
that
fullers
esb
is
actually
quite
different
from
other
strong
bitters
even
though
they
kind
of
invented
the
style
i
can
see
the
difference
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
pours
a
clear
amberbrown
with
a
nice
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
the
head
is
pretty
creamyfrothy
and
leaves
medium
lacing
behind
smell
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
smell
with
a
bit
of
laid
back
hops
in
the
background
the
malts
are
not
overly
caramel
in
aroma
like
some
other
beers
i
have
had
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
nutty
and
bready
characteristic
to
the
smell
taste
is
nice
the
malts
shine
through
very
very
well
and
they
should
the
caramel
stays
behind
a
bit
and
lets
some
fruitycitrus
and
earthy
hops
shine
through
the
bitterness
is
low
and
is
expected
to
be
in
the
misleadingly
named
style
the
nutty
and
bready
plays
a
minor
role
in
the
taste
also
i
think
this
beer
has
one
of
the
best
malthop
balances
ever
very
nice
the
caramel
starts
to
take
a
front
seat
but
never
kills
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
great
for
the
flavor
the
body
is
lightmoderate
and
the
carbs
are
moderately
high
the
only
thing
i
would
add
here
is
a
bit
more
creaminess
and
it
would
be
perfect
i
would
love
to
session
this
beer
the
price
and
taste
make
for
a
very
highly
drinkable
beer
i
am
mad
that
my
first
bottle
was
old
or
just
went
bad
during
shipping
the
fresh
version
of
this
beer
is
very
good
deep
gold
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
mainly
fruity
taste
is
fruity
jamtoast
and
a
hint
of
caramel
tasty
and
smooth
goes
down
like
cool
spring
water
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
i
would
recommend
and
i
can
see
myself
purchasing
this
again
sometime
in
the
short
future
overall
tastes
and
feels
like
a
supreme
session
beer
but
at
5
9
abv
it
is
a
little
high
for
comfort
drinking
this
shows
fullers
skill
in
hiding
the
alcohol
a
very
good
esb
d
this
beer
is
empressively
drinkable
with
little
to
deter
you
from
drinking
pint
after
pint
in
a
pub
cheers
notes
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
english
beer
overall
i
want
this
to
be
a
bit
more
bitter
but
it
is
flavorful
and
smooth
so
maybe
im
just
nitpicking
its
drinkable
in
that
its
under
6
and
pretty
tasty
but
im
still
kind
of
disappointed
that
it
wasnt
as
bitter
so
that
takes
some
points
away
still
worth
a
try
i
think
if
not
just
to
get
your
take
on
perhaps
the
mosthyped
esb
and
its
down
like
sugar
water
m
d
light
with
lower
co2
but
good
refreshing
crispness
overall
great
beer
fullers
always
delivers
d
not
bad
but
not
mindblowing
either
maybe
i
like
other
esbs
more
very
drinkable
and
quite
sessionable
balance
is
excellent
in
some
ways
feels
and
tastes
lighter
than
the
5
9
listed
good
beer
worth
sipping
an
enjoying
high
marks
for
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
smell
kind
of
lacks
but
not
arguing
pours
copper
brown
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
with
some
spicy
earthy
hops
there
is
also
some
fruit
character
the
beer
ends
with
a
sweet
nutty
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
pours
a
clear
red
with
a
little
bit
of
foam
at
the
top
of
the
pint
glass
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
strong
bitter
beer
either
but
it
served
its
purpose
as
a
session
beer
when
there
was
no
other
options
so
i
was
a
little
suprised
with
that
thought
it
would
have
been
more
of
a
struggle
to
put
these
down
d
im
somewhat
new
to
the
style
but
from
what
ive
had
this
outshines
all
the
rest
d
great
beer
to
have
several
of
i
enjoyed
this
one
d
its
good
mouthfeel
and
inoffensive
flavour
make
this
one
easy
to
drink
ambercolored
body
with
a
big
twofinger
cream
colored
head
a
nice
amount
of
lace
and
good
head
retention
the
aroma
is
decent
but
could
be
better
most
of
what
i
get
is
caramel
and
a
faint
earthy
hop
both
of
those
aromas
are
there
in
the
flavor
with
a
big
burst
of
carameltoffee
type
malt
flavors
the
hops
show
through
with
an
earthiness
and
a
twist
of
an
offbitter
citrus
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
smooth
and
adds
a
bit
of
warmth
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
the
best
around
if
you
like
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
and
earthy
hops
this
might
be
the
one
for
you
otherwise
you
can
probably
find
a
better
beer
for
the
cost
really
a
beautiful
malt
accented
real
ale
a
classic
the
downside
its
very
expensive
running
at
about
12
bucks
a
sixpack
thats
absurd
for
a
pale
ale
even
for
an
import
d
although
more
typical
for
an
esb
the
higher
abv
as
compared
to
other
english
styles
makes
this
less
appealing
however
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
ah
yes
this
is
simply
a
treat
so
much
going
on
truly
balanced
as
an
esb
should
be
caramel
malts
hoppy
spikes
even
a
sour
dough
sense
it
actually
is
bitter
but
in
a
way
that
serves
the
whole
and
its
not
so
much
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
in
sync
with
this
nice
and
smooth
too
much
carbonation
would
hide
the
already
bristling
bitter
sense
amazingly
delicious
and
refreshing
an
all
year
round
ale
for
sure
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
and
highly
recommended
will
have
to
revisit
snevadas
spring
version
and
other
takes
on
this
style
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
i
would
definitely
be
ok
drinking
this
for
an
evening
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
flavors
on
the
palate
are
quite
mindblowing
in
their
delicacy
opening
with
a
blend
of
slightly
burnt
toast
caramel
and
butterscotch
there
is
also
a
firm
hop
bitterness
providing
a
backbone
for
all
the
malt
flavors
to
play
off
bitterness
is
herbal
and
earthy
and
theres
also
a
touch
of
leafy
hop
character
drying
and
mildly
bitter
on
the
finish
theres
a
melange
of
flavors
a
touch
of
sugar
caramel
and
butterscotch
to
go
with
the
hops
closer
to
medium
in
body
than
light
this
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
and
has
a
mildly
creamy
mouthfeel
thoroughly
drinkable
im
almost
done
with
this
in
10
minutes
i
need
to
track
this
down
on
cask
d
seems
like
a
hopped
up
version
of
london
pride
which
i
suppose
is
to
be
expected
a
lovely
light
tan
head
with
lacing
all
around
sits
atop
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
fluid
a
light
aroma
featuring
caramel
earthy
and
floral
hops
sandwich
yeasty
fruit
esters
and
breads
taste
is
superbly
malty
with
a
light
floral
hop
finish
sooo
balanced
a
light
dryness
that
flows
into
more
earthy
and
lightly
herbal
hoppiness
feel
is
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
crispness
that
cuts
though
medium
weight
dry
and
quenching
superb
drinkability
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
i
was
shocked
to
see
the
abv
as
i
started
my
review
still
goes
down
like
a
session
ale
this
is
a
beer
for
all
seasons
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
of
this
beer
after
all
these
reviews
i
do
enjoy
esbs
i
enjoyed
southern
tiers
very
much
but
to
me
this
one
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
danother
great
representation
of
the
style
from
fullers
and
a
great
tasting
complex
beer
to
boot
the
flavor
is
all
sweet
hints
of
candy
flavors
with
a
strong
sweetbread
flavor
slight
hints
of
fruits
with
toffee
and
caramel
it
matches
its
scent
well
the
mouth
feel
of
this
truly
stands
out
to
me
the
flavor
maybe
on
the
mild
side
but
it
still
feels
very
full
and
well
crafted
the
beer
delivers
the
flavor
in
an
awesome
consistency
this
is
a
good
beer
d
the
sweetness
kinda
kills
the
drinkability
for
me
i
find
it
wearing
but
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
beer
i
could
see
myself
downing
this
one
with
ease
d
the
definition
of
poundable
color
is
a
light
brown
heavy
gold
with
nice
luminosity
and
clarity
aroma
is
malt
heavy
some
caramel
notes
in
there
slightly
sweet
in
aroma
and
flavor
theres
a
light
and
delicate
contra
presence
of
fuggle
or
another
mild
hop
however
it
comes
a
bit
stronger
through
in
flavor
than
aroma
some
greasy
biscuit
like
flavor
gives
a
full
presence
on
the
tongue
entertaining
but
no
means
overwhelming
i
havent
had
this
one
in
quite
some
time
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
tasty
that
being
said
im
thinking
i
will
need
to
drink
it
again
soon
and
perhaps
the
rest
of
fullers
lineup
overall
exceptional
ale
it
is
a
session
beer
all
the
way
that
deserves
its
place
as
a
classic
esb
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
d
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
it
goes
down
easy
glass
a
light
tan
head
forms
on
top
about
a
quarter
inch
high
staying
there
and
not
moving
from
that
height
the
malt
is
striking
at
first
scent
followed
by
a
light
grassy
scent
and
the
brief
fragrance
of
citrus
at
the
end
bread
and
yeast
burst
from
the
glass
at
first
taste
that
is
soon
followed
by
a
red
grapefruit
bitterness
that
is
very
mild
in
strength
it
finishes
with
grassy
and
tobacco
flavors
and
those
flavors
linger
for
some
time
the
feel
is
a
tad
watery
at
the
front
growing
to
medium
bodied
feel
it
thickens
even
more
as
it
reaches
the
back
of
the
palate
this
is
an
easy
sipping
english
ale
a
great
session
beer
that
brings
flavor
aroma
and
texture
to
the
table
plus
it
goes
really
well
with
fish
and
chips
t
it
has
a
kind
of
caramel
taste
to
it
and
the
bitter
while
strong
is
smooth
and
balanced
by
the
caramel
and
perhaps
a
slight
fruitiness
in
there
the
flavors
are
all
present
just
not
in
the
abundance
i
was
looking
for
caramel
and
sweet
fruits
with
a
tickle
of
hops
bitterness
ramp
up
the
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweet
flavors
and
youd
have
a
solid
beer
it
felt
good
was
enjoyable
to
drink
but
was
just
too
forgettable
really
good
beer
like
a
bass
pale
with
all
the
good
stuff
amped
up
a
bit
malt
is
heavier
more
sweet
and
actually
get
some
hop
bitterness
sort
of
half
way
between
an
english
pale
and
american
pale
but
really
well
balanced
i
wouldnt
really
change
anything
i
do
get
that
special
mineraly
thing
supposedly
from
the
water
which
i
like
its
got
a
bit
more
abv
kick
than
bass
so
not
sure
its
quite
a
session
beer
but
for
pure
delicious
flavor
this
is
a
benchmark
beer
for
sure
available
at
the
lcbo
in
ontario
this
may
be
the
archetypical
esb
but
i
can
think
of
two
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
are
much
better
stone
cat
bitch
creek
still
pretty
good
though
notes
extremely
quaffable
and
delicious
a
tasty
brew
that
focuses
on
balance
without
being
over
the
top
like
american
pales
can
be
d
hell
i
could
drink
a
12
pack
of
those
very
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
great
malt
hops
balance
rich
flavor
but
still
a
sessionable
ale
d
very
good
esb
i
was
expecting
something
one
dimensional
but
the
malts
and
hops
in
here
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
time
this
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
beer
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
this
is
a
good
brew
overall
the
excellence
of
this
beer
can
be
credited
to
the
combination
of
rich
treacley
malt
character
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bittering
hops
its
quite
simply
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
and
beautifully
balanced
so
much
so
its
greatest
strength
is
arguably
its
biggest
weakness
its
just
far
too
easy
to
drink
for
an
ale
of
this
strength
a
supreme
esb
a
supreme
beer
a
very
good
beer
that
im
glad
to
find
if
im
every
in
the
olde
country
again
ill
watch
for
this
in
every
pub
i
enter
thatll
be
more
than
one
im
sure
fullers
esb
pours
a
crisp
copper
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
caramel
and
some
toffee
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
some
metallic
hops
followed
by
caramel
and
finished
with
a
nice
moderate
bitterness
there
is
a
bit
of
metallic
nice
earthy
hop
flavor
that
really
rounds
out
the
sweetness
living
in
northern
ontario
i
am
glad
to
see
a
good
beer
like
this
at
the
local
lcbo
good
beer
however
in
my
experience
freshness
is
a
huge
part
of
a
great
esb
hugely
under
rated
style
leads
to
low
shelf
turnover
but
if
you
find
yourself
with
a
six
pack
of
fresh
esb
not
much
else
is
better
for
a
good
session
a
flagship
bitter
that
most
bitter
are
compared
to
a
quintessential
flavor
of
bitter
earth
toffee
and
citrus
does
get
milder
as
it
gets
warmer
although
the
malt
is
nice
and
mild
without
too
much
yeast
bready
but
not
protein
in
taste
well
balanced
i
imagine
incredibly
nice
in
cask
to
accent
the
bitter
earth
d
enjoyable
definitely
sessionable
drinkability
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
the
bitterness
is
spot
on
i
have
to
say
i
love
this
beer
definitely
worth
a
repeat
pours

a

rests
in
the
glass
with
a
dark
caramel
color
topped
by
thick
offwhite

retains
impressively
well
the
nose
brings
to
mind
butterscotch
dark
honey
and
light
esters
theres
a
touch
of
floral
earthy
hoppiness
but
its
buried
beneath
the
malt
the
taste
is
neither
as
rich
nor
sweet
as
the
aroma
implies
its
amply
malty
but
balanced
by
a
big
hop
bitterness
theres
a
hint
of
buttery
diacetyl
up

but
its
quickly
overwhelmed
by
flavors
of
roasted

abv
flavors
of

linger
on
in
the
long

finish
very
enjoyable
stuff
id
love
to
try
this
on
handpump
the
mouthfeel
is
medium

with
low
carbonation
easy
quaffing
ale
a
superb
brew
one
of
my
favourite
bitters
definitely
worth
a
go
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
was
unimpressed
aroma
promises
more
richness
than
is
delivered
malt
profile
is
overly
sweet
yet
its
a
pretty
dry
beer
that
was
odd
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
would
have
had
another
but
i
wouldnt
get
up
and
drive
to
the
store
for
it
if
you
see
this
one
on
tap
dont
hessitate
d
great
to
drink
could
even
call
it
a
session
beer
smooth
and
creamy
with
no
courseness
and
low
carbonation
starts
caramel
malty
and
is
very
well
balanced
with
nice
herbal
hops
that
are
not
overly
bitter
in
the
semidry
finish
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
well
balanced
good
aftertaste
with
a
little
mineral
and
then
diactyl
i
will
buy
again
d
this
is
the
quintessential
pub
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
great
with
that
wonderful
melange
of
bitterness
and
freshness
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
you
could
easily
sit
and
blissfully
down
pint
after
pint
of
the
brew
d
as
i
said
very
quaffable
i
could
see
putting
back
quite
a
few
of
these
m
moderate
carbonation
good
summer
drink
and
a
solid
english
esb
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
sit
and
drink
a
case
but
the
best
beers
shouldnt
be
consumed
like
that
anyway
a
couple
or
few
of
these
would
be
great
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
medium
size
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
glass
its
aromas
of
toffee
and
autumn
leaves
is
very
pleasant
flavors
of
minerals
herbs
and
leafy
hops
do
an
excellent
job
of
supporting
its
toasty
and
fruity
malt
profile
reminiscent
of
trail
mix
with
dried
apricots
im
sold
on
this
classic
dalthough
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
hotness
i
think
this
beer
could
be
quite
sessionable
its
a
good
beer
just
not
all
i
was
expecting
cheers
dnot
as
bitter
as
i
expected
and
thus
more
drinkable
this
is
very
nice
but
not
a
favored
style
of
mine
overall
great
strong
bitter
perhaps
this
one
doesnt
get
the
notoriety
it
deserves
because
its
so
easy
to
find

lived
up

quaff
all

out
a
shade
darker

beer
also
a
very
good
example
of
what
this
style
should
be
cheers
future
outlook
not
really
too
into
most
esbs
so
itll
probably
be
awhile
before
i
revisit
this
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
so
easy
to
put
this
one
away
and
with
a
big
smile
doing
so
im
going
to
buy
this
often
i
want
the
lcbo
to
keep
carrying
it
mfd
a
good
creamy
beer
really
coats
the
mouth
could
be
a
bit
more
chewy
but
the
amount
of
carbonation
was
perfect
a
great
beer
overall
light
mouthfeel
with
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
brew
out
again
however
as
i
got
closer
to
the
end
of
the
glass
and
my
throat
seemed
more
then
a
little
parched
near
the
end
then
frankly
it
should
be
its
a
good
beer
yes
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
really
this
beer
is
perfect
session
ale
because
sadly
that
is
the
only
time
i
could
see
wanting
or
receiving
another
one
of
these
maybe
this
is
another
case
of
not
having
enough
experience
with
the
style
to
fully
appreciate
it
still
as
i
said
it
is
still
a
good
beer
just
not
a
great
one
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
special
beer
and
one
that
should
be
reserved
for
limited
enjoyment
in
that
sense
it
aint
fit
for
a
session
beer
in
my
books
on
the
other
hand
a
real
pleasure
to
consume
and
i
would
definitely
seek
it
out
again
d
i
like
everything
about
this
esb
except
the
finish
sticky
mouthfeel
its
definitely
something
i
will
pick
up
again
its
been
a
few
years
since
i
sampled
this
one
fullers
esb
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
about
half
an
inch
thick
carbonation
is
vigorous
with
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
floral
with
fruity
hop
character
and
a
sweet
malt
backbone
this
is
a
very
balanced
beer
sweet
and
malty
with
toast
and
caramel
notes
followed
by
a
nice
dry
hop
finish
its
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
and
the
flavors
remain
on
the
palate
for
a
good
amount
of
time
very
drinkable
this
esb
is
a
great
session
beer
a
nice
stong
malt
flavor
with
a
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
to
it
much
as
an
esb
should
be
an
aftertaste
that
is
subtle
but
doesnt
let
you
forget
what
youre
drinking
definitly
one
i
will
have
again
i
was
quite
surprised
with
the
tastiness
of
this
brew
and
the
fact
they
have
champion
ale
on
their
label
makes
a
little
sense
to
me
now
poured
a
light
copper
body
with
a
twofinger
white
head
that
disipated
quickly
a
nice
smell
of
malts
and
hops
for
a
breezy
aroma
a
mediumboded
beer
that
is
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
with
a
fruity
taste
picked
up
something
akin
to
applespears
malts
are
in
there
but
subdued
with
some
sweetness
and
a
little
dry
leafiness
for
balance
overall
an
easydrinking
beer
that
passes
tasty
and
smooth
and
has
a
nice
crisp
backbite
simple
but
effective
drinkability
is
awesome
its
a
hot
day
today
and
im
sure
i
could
if
given
the
opportunity
consume
the
entire
supply
of
my
bev
distributor
and
still
want
more
overall
a
very
good
esb
really
strong
atmosphere
appearance
is
great
and
outstanding
nose
flavor
has
a
really
good
balance
nothing
really
overpowers
or
stands
out
but
really
profound
taken
together
overall
really
good
quaff
granted
it
is
a
nice
bitter
but
surely
not
my
favourite
and
calling
it
the
extra
special
champion
ale
is
exaggerating
a
little
in
my
opinion
perhaps
itll
take
a
trip
to
england
to
convince
me
otherwise
and
i
likely
will
continue
to
revisit
the
esb
every
so
often
to
be
sure
but
i
wouldnt
consider
this
even
the
champion
of
the
fullers
lineup
either
fullers
chiswick
andor
the
fullers
1845
are
far
far
more
deserving
of
that
title
this
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
esb
and
with
good
reason
it
manages
to
possess
the
perfect
balance
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
creamy
malty
smoothness
with
caramel
vanilla
and
oatmeal
notes
i
could
drink
this
one
7
days
a
week
and
never
tire
of
it
it
is
an
expensive
brew
but
well
worth
the
price
i
might
be
inclined
to
drink
this
over
any
trappist
belgian
it
is
that
good
divine
nectar
here
drinkability
i
found
this
a
quite
drinkable
bitter
and
would
be
willing
to
make
this
the
beer
of
the
evening
if
i
were
out
for
drinks
and
conversation
with
friends
whether
id
prefer
it
to
another
bitter
i
cant
really
answer
in
the
us
and
without
being
able
to
sample
it
in
its
natural
habitat
along
side
other
bitters
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
enough
interest
to
make
this
a
beer
worth
drinking
and
a
refreshing
quality
which
is
quite
nice
pours
brownish
amber
leaves
a
thin
white
lace
very
little
head
smells
caramellike
and
of
some
earthy
or
kind
of
metallic
notes
theres
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
medium
hop
bitterness
flavors
from
the
hops
are
earthy
and
quite
refreshing
semisweet
caramel
flavors
and
brown
sugar
dominate
the
palate
but
are
no
where
near
cloying
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
when
i
think
of
english
beer
this
is
what
i
picture
bright
copper
orange
in
the
glass
mostly
clear
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
it
stays
thin
but
laces
a
bit
the
smell
is
good
caramel
grain
and
toasted
buttery
biscuit
and
coarse
hops
with
a
touch
of
metallic
sharpness
the
taste
is
solid
malt
with
a
good
deal
of
sweet
grain
perfectly
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
its
never
really
bitter
but
shows
a
great
malt
presence
throughout
which
is
accented
by
just
enough
english
hop
to
make
it
really
pleasant
the
low
carbonation
in
this
beer
gives
it
a
great
level
of
smoothness
throughout
that
stays
sweet
until
the
finish
which
is
fairly
dry
and
slightly
bitter
maybe
im
just
a
sucker
for
old
school
british
beer
and
styles
but
i
really
like
this
one
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
one
category
but
when
all
put
together
its
a
pretty
good
beer
d
this
beer
transports
me
to
a
different
place
and
time
it
makes
me
wish
for
british
pub
life
perfectly
drinkable
and
great
balance
just
recently
available
in
ontario
in
a
can
cognac
colour
red
tinges
beige
or
light
sand
head
moderate
carbonation
bubbles
are
medium
large
a
bit
of
lace
and
a
ring
smell
is
malt
mild
floral
hops
taste
is
malt
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
long
bitter
finish
balance
is
just
about
right
ive
never
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
cant
comment
on
whether
the
can
or
the
trip
overseas
diminished
it
by
the
15
minutes
mark
it
was
quite
flat
but
the
taste
got
only
better
easily
a
sessional
id
be
happy
to
have
this
available
just
about
anytime
mouthfeel
the
beer
seemed
not
far
from
flat
perhaps
by
design
perhaps
by
bad
regulator
settings
this
is
my
first
beer
here
tonight
ill
see
how
the
rest
are
in
any
case
not
much
fizziness
in
the
beer
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
said
since
the
first
timothy
taylor
i
have
tried
nearly
100
different
beers
the
fullers
esb
was
one
of
the
first
i
tasted
and
really
liked
the
brew
i
admit
i
am
not
perfect
yet
at
detecting
aroma
color
etcetera
but
loved
the
drinkability
taste
and
aftertaste
of
the
fullers
an
amazing
beer
so
well
balanced
and
just
great
flavors
overall
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
really
cranks
up
the
drinkability
as
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
truly
a
perfect
esb
and
one
of
the
greats
d
highly
drinkable
but
a
bit
light
in
body
and
flavor
needs
a
little
modernization
and
an
injection
of
modern
brewing
energy
london
porter
is
a
much
better
representation
of
its
style
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
still
an
easy
drinker
light
copper
amber
with
white
head
caramel
butterscotch
woodchips
in
the
scent
flavors
are
mellow
but
satisfying
vanilla
butterscotch
malt
biscuits
mild
hops
in
the
finish
a
smooth
amiable
mouthfeel
in
a
medium
bodied
brew
highly
sessionable
and
light
on
the
stomach
easy
drinking
for
easy
living
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
as
mentioned
it
was
my
gateway
beer
so
it
will
always
have
a
small
place
in
my
heart
d
a
solid
and
respectable
esb
all
the
way
around
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
particular
category
but
it
also
doesnt
fall
short
in
any
areas
i
would
gladly
enjoy
in
the
future
not
a
beer
that
i
would
consider
a
session
beer
it
is
fairly
light
on
the
palate
and
is
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
decent
esb
it
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
for
me
d
very
drinkable
well
made
big
box
beer
pretty
carbonated
at
first
but
finishes
creamy
and
smooth
this
is
not
my
favourite
style
of
beer
but
this
represents
it
very
well
pretty
sure
fullers
coined
the
name
esb
anyways
poured
from
the
bottle
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
half
an
inch
of
head
that
didnt
last
long
loads
of
carbonation
at
first
then
the
glass
looks
as
much
like
colored
water
as
it
does
beer
immediately
after
the
pour
i
smelled
a
terrific
breadiness
but
after
a
minute
i
only
smell
a
hint
of
minerals
the
taste
blows
away
any
blandness
of
smell
however
a
buttery
toffee
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced
by
a
light
hop
note
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
smooth
with
just
a
slight
hop
note
the
balance
in
flavor
and
overall
subtlety
just
makes
this
a
delicious
incredibly
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
silky
smooth
and
it
goes
down
in
gulps
overall
a
very
solid
drinkable
beer
moderately
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
head
and
some
irregular
prickle
that
seems
to
populate
the
body
of
the
beer
in
fits
and
starts
hoppy
nose
with
undertones
of
roasted
malts
nice
balance
to
the
nose
smooth
attack
and
creamy
mouthfeel
some
hops
explodes
in
the
mouth
as
the
finish
approaches
with
that
hops
explosion
the
finish
is
still
decidedly
smooth
i
had
the
opportune
or
misfortune
depending
on
your
perspective
to
not
only
sample
this
for
review
in
a
glass
but
also
to
pull
a
bottle
from
the
cooler
at
a
barbeque
and
i
am
able
to
comment
that
this
beer
is
far
better
when
allowed
to
breath
in
a
glass
than
when
sucked
out
of
the
bottle
pouts
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
frothy
white
head
head
quickly
dissipates
to
a
small
layer
leaving
minimal
lacing
smell
is
slightly
sweet
and
floral
starts
out
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
with
some
bitterness
and
caramel
flavor
and
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
only
mildly
carbonated
it
is
fairly
smooth
and
doesnt
leave
a
thick
aftertaste
a
very
good
esb
overall
very
smooth
with
a
crispness
low
on
the
carbonation
to
make
this
guy
very
sessionable
gotta
love
a
good
esb
and
for
me
this
is
a
prime
example
of
the
style
d
although
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
hops
fan
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
not
very
drinkable
the
main
problem
for
me
is
the
overall
fruity
sweetness
of
this
brew
if
the
sweetnessbitterness
of
the
brew
was
toned
down
a
bit
making
it
mellow
yet
flavorful
i
think
it
could
be
a
winner
unfortunatly
as
is
i
am
nowhere
near
impressed
all
in
all
its
not
an
experience
that
i
wish
to
repeat
any
time
soon
i
mean
no
disrepect
of
course
its
just
my
opinion
d
pretty
drinkable
although
something
is
missing
all
around
a
quite
good
readilyavailable
beer
d
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
before
now
i
drink
this
quite
often
a
classic
indeed
pours
a
crystal
clear
coppery
orange
some
ruby
highlights
thin
off
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
collar
no
real
lacing
looks
alright

and
nutty

esb
but
ive
hadmade
better
nice
to
have
this
in
cans
though
i
just
recently
had
my
first
fullers
esb
and
i
loved
it
a
very
good
looking
beer
with
an
outstanding
taste
and
great
smell
my
brother
and
i
tried
to
replicate
it
and
we
were
nowhere
close
to
it
but
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
fullers
esb
and
hopefully
many
more
to
come
d
it
is
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
went
down
smoothly
this
would
be
an
enjoyable
brew
while
watching
some
football
and
by
football
i
mean
soccer
i
have
had
many
other
esbs
before
sampling
the
original
i
am
really
glad
to
have
tried
this
to
see
the
standard
as
a
reference
point
for
the
style
this
is
going
to
be
a
beer
that
i
come
back
to
many
times
the
foam
was
wheat
in
color
the
smell
malty
and
nutty
with
nice
fruity
overtones
the
color
was
a
orange
brown
and
hint
of
red
in
the
light
the
taste
was
fruity
nutty
malty
crisp
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
little
bitter
mouthfeel
smooth
and
light
drinkability
was
good
d
understated
tasty
the
sweetness
might
gnaw
on
me
after
a
while
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
to
date
the
balance
between
the
buttery
sweet
malts
and
the
dry
subtle
hops
is
unparalleled
without
doubt
the
best
fullers
brew
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
cant
wait
to
crack
open
the
vintage
ale
ive
got
sitting
down
in
my
cellar
next
time
i
see
this
bad
boy
im
buying
in
mass
quantaties
being
one
of
my
first
esbs
im
almost
scared
to
buy
another
thinking
that
it
wont
compare
to
this
highly
recommended
pours
a
copper
color
with
very
little
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
very
buttery
and
malty
i
was
very
surprised
i
expected
much
more
bitterness
considering
the
style
but
there
is
very
little
bitterness
and
very
little
taste
of
hops
the
flavor
is
of
fruit
maybe
plum
and
it
has
a
buttery
flavor
there
is
a
hint
of
bitter
behind
the
flavor
and
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
bitter
but
it
definitely
is
not
the
bitterness
i
expected
the
mouth
is
quite
nice
there
is
little
carbonation
but
still
there
is
a
tart
feeling
to
this
beer
its
quite
drinkable
though
with
the
6
and
the
size
of
the
bottle
one
is
enough
for
me
its
all
around
an
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
creamy
and
buttery
come
to
mind
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
classic
fullers
mouthfeel
one
of
the
nicest
versions
of
one
of
my
favourite
styles
of
beer
its
almost
too
drinkable
pours
a
dark
hazy
opaque
coppery
brown
with
a
decent
finebubbled
beige

aroma
is
spicy
slightly
smoky
slightly
hoppy
with
a
strong
undertone

at

fairly
bitter
but
not
fiercely
so
and
has
undertones

edgy
and
lively
spent
some
time
looking
for
a
fresh
bottle
finally
found
one
with
a
few
months
until
the
best
before

pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
to

carmelized

with
some
mineral
qualities
until
the
wonderful
floral
and
herbal
hop
aroma
takes
over
i
love
the
aroma
of
english
hops
the
flavor
does
not
disapoint
either
herbal
hop
flavor
from
the
get
go
but
there
is
a
solid
malt
backbone
that
lends
a
sweetness
throughout
even
some
fruity

the
end
definate

nice
carbonation
that
compliments
the
body
the
texture
is
not
perfect
but
very
good
for
a
session
beer
i
think
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
for
an
esb
i
will
find
more
fresh
bottles
and
enjoying
this
again
soon
a
nice
drinker
and
a
bit
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
one
to
savor
great
selection
for
this
one
nice
hearty
beer
overall
my
impression
was
pretty
much
a
good
stew
beer
or
nice
cold
weather
meal
beer
fairly
decent
as
far
as
taste
goes
i
really
could
go
for
another
one
bought
this
in
a
sampler
pack
at
the
local
beer
shop
overall
this
is
definately
one
i
will
be
getting
again
overall
a
pleasant
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
but
certainly
not
spectacular
this
would
and
indeed
does
for
me
at
least
make
quite
a
fine
session
ale
in
those
places
where
hoppy
north
american
offerings
arent
featured
by
design
anyways
its
sure
nice
to
enjoy
this
beyond
earlyday
euro
cup
game
times
around
these
parts
medium
to
full
bodied
rounds
out
in
the
mouth
chewy
extraordinary
length
it
just
never
stops
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
will
give
it
a
revisit
every
now
and
then
d
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
bitter
from
fullers
named
extra
special
bitter
esb
it
lives
up
to
that
naming
a
strong
somewhat
bitter
beer
without
lingering
bitterness
i
found
it
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
only
beer
of
this
style
that
might
exceed
it
is
a
beer
i
believe
is
called
six
x
in
the
uk
the
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
are
outstanding
best
on
draft
d
this
is
a
very
good
english
ale
tasty
and
goes
down
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
from
the
fuller
line
up
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
i
friend
any
time
drinkability
this
one
grew
on
me
my
first
impression
was
very
bitter
but
its
complexity
came
out
after
the
first
few
sips
this
is
a
sipper
but
one
that
i
will
have
again
d
fair
drinkability
i
think
that
these
might
hit
you
pretty
hard
after
3
or
4
d
pretty
nice
brew
and
worth
getting
again
dvery
easy
to
drink
something
to
keep
around
for
when
the
mood
strikes
or
on
a
warm
day
mouth
is
so
smooth
and
delicate
with
a
medium
to
low
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
very
easy
and
is
one
of
the
most
delicate
and
enjoyable
esbs
ive
ever
had
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
one
of
the
true
classics
imo
dnow
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
esb
style
i
like
it
a
lot
since
im
a
big
fan
of
bitters
in
general
perfect
for
anyone
who
likes
pale
ales
and
bitters
had
this
one
on
cask
at
the
memphis
taproom
as
part
of
their
no
repeat
beer
week
during
philly
beer
week
served
to
me
in
a
shaker
glass
and
appeared
a
cloudy
amberbrown
color
with
a
solid
two
fingers
of
fluffy
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
bread
and
biscuits
with
a
touch
of
caramel
super
smooth
and
fulfilling
a
fantastic
esb
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
all
day
dthis
beer
on
cask
has
got
to
be
the
benchmark
esb
it
is
simple
yet
delicious
and
quaffable
beyond
belief
when
obtained
fresh
and
on
cask
this
is
one
of
the
great
beers
on
the
planet
d
this
beer
was
made
to
be
pulled
from
a
handpump
the
flavors
really
blossom
here
id
imagine
fullers
would
have
to
be
the
benchmark
esb
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
simple
classic
and
delicious
in
the
mouthfeel
theres
only
coffee
very
good
to
accompany
with
blue
cheese
d
very
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
good
taste
that
goes
down
smoothly
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
in
one
sitting
worth
trying
the
beer
felt
a
little
undercarbonated
but
not
really
to
the
detriment
of
the
beer
i
would
say
that
it
had
a
medium
body
to
it
smooth
creamy
and
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
easily
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
to
date
and
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
tried
to
date
period
excellent
beer
appearance
is
like
a
cider
clear
and
golden
with
little
head
the
nose
is
a
little
buttery
straw
and
wheat
some
spices
that
i
cant
quite
pick
out
mild
flavor
buttery
and
smooth
the
hops
dont
really
sink
in
until
the
finish
full
round
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
generally
a
pleasant
brew
i
could
easily
sip
this
one
the
whole
night
a
perfect
session
brew
for
a
british
pub
not
the
best
esb
i
have
ever
had
but
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
a
classic
english
beer
hazy
copper
color
3
finger
head
nice
brew
smelled
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
malt
taste
a
bit
more
maltly
but
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
bitterness
doesnt
stick
around
in
my
mouth
so
its
okay
clean
and
crisp
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
its
good
but
i
prefer
the
london
pride
to
this
one
drinkability
ok
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
over
a
good
drinking
esb
theres
a
noticeable
presence
of
floral
hops
maybe
a
bit
much
for
my
tastes
easy
to
drink
for
a
while
but
i
might
get
bored
of
this
after
a
few
for
an
esb
this
is
a
prime
example
though
d
good
drinkability
nice
balance
of
caramel
malt
and
bitter
hops
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
ale
i
probably
wont
grab
it
first
as
i
often
fall
prey
to
highly
hopped
and
high
alcohol
beers
i
must
make
a
point
to
go
for
this
one
more
often
and
it
is
quite
nice
has
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
behind
on
the
glass
but
doesnt
last
terribly
long
odd
theres
plenty
of
malt
in
the
aroma
with
some
peaches
and
raisins
but
whats
really
present
in
the
nose
is
alcohol
the
same
is
true
for
the
taste
while
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
strong
malt
content
and
the
balanced
hops
hit
the
alcohol
overshadowed
much
of
the
flavor
for
a
5
9
beer
i
was
surprised
overall
this
had
the
boozy
feel
of
a
belgian
quad
with
a
malty
intensity
that
came
close
to
matching
that
style
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
not
bad
frankly
i
expected
something
a
bit
less
dense
still
since
i
bought
two
bottles
ill
have
to
give
this
one
another
swing
soon
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
ambercopper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
thin
white
film
on
top
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
yeast
also
slight
note
of
alcohol
is
also
evident
but
barely
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
and
malt
with
some
fruity
taste
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
but
works
with
this
beer
this
brew
is
wellbalanced
overall
and
very
drinkable
certainly
a
beer
for
a
session
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
mild
carbonation
creamy
this
is
seriously
drinkable
and
my
favorite
english
bitter
of
all
i
have
tried
i
could
easily
sip
these
all
night
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
smells
strongly
of
raisins
in
my
opinion
taste
is
very
malty
and
fruity
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
expected
medium
mouthfeel
that
kind
of
coats
the
mouth
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
would
tire
of
it
after
more
than
3
not
bad
but
definitely
not
a
goto
beer
if
you
havent
had
a
taste
of
this
great
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
a
couple
up
trust
me
youll
want
more
than
one

i
dont
drink
this
one
nearly

it
is
quite
expensive
but
it
is
worth
seeking
out
it
is
at
its
very
best
on
tap
which
brings
out
all
of
its
complexities
drinkability
well
im
no
e
s
b
connoisseur
but
this
was
a
very
good
d
this
is
so
so
well
balanced
quite
different
from
your
standard
american
craft
beer
that
tends
to
be
dominated
by
a
specific
characteristic
this
is
as
close
to
an
ideally
wellbalanced
beer
ive
had
500ml
brown
bottle
from
barbs
beer
emporium
in
concord
pours
a
translucent
copper
body
with
a
good
inch
of
offwhite

that
leaves
some
good

caramel
and
toffee
share
the
aroma
with
some
herbal
and
floral
hops
caramel
toffee
nut
chocolate
and
coffee
all
jump
out
initially
with
a
good
amount
of
herbal
floral
grassy
hops
with
just
the
slightest
hints
of
licorice
banana
and
butterscotch
medium
to
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
super
drinkable
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
esb
i
have
ever
had
flavor
is
so
complex
and
yet
complimentary
and
balanced
i
can
find
almost
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
phenomenal
overall
this
is
in
the
english
tradition
of
a
seemingly
simple
ale
with
many
subtle
flavors
nothing
overpowering
or
in
your
face
just
a
very
pleasant
standard
bearer
of
the
stylequiet

reserved

this

the

underneath
the
sweetness
lies
some

scents
medium
to
fullbodied
level
of
carbonation
matches
the
weight
and
allows
the
beer
to
pause
in
the
mouth
for
consideration
here
theres
more
of
a
dry
chocolate
powder
and
malt
thing
going
on
than
sweeter
caramel
maybe
raw
coffee
beans
fruitcake
kind
of
flavoring
neither
fully
candied
nor
fresh
the
fruit
does
feel
formed
presence
extends
from
tongue
to
mouth
roof
more
hops
present
as
mouth
residue
but
wouldnt
necessarily
call
it
bitter
a
delicious
beer
and
the
best
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
light
white
head
brews
a
very
nice
dark
but
clear
golden
hue
smells
like
rich
caramel
and
british
malts
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
not
too
sweet
but
deep
malty
and
inviting
crisp
and
hoppy
in
all
the
right
places
on
the
palate
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
d
reminds
me
of
visits
to
the
churchill
arms
it
doesnt
get
any
more
drinkable
than
this
this
beer
feels
great
to
drink
its
very
refreshing
and
the
mouthfeel
seems
spoton
a
great
session
beer
as
esbs
should
be
this
is
a
beer
you
can
rely
on
pours
a
bright
white
head
and
a
golden
rust
color
not
much
of
a
scent
here
but
banana
caramel
and
malt
characters
emerge
after
some
inspection
so
smooth
great
malt
character
that
is
complex
but
extremely
drinkable
cut
with
delicate
hop
flavor
this
beer
takes
excerpts
from
brown
ales
english
milds
and
belgian
doubles
which
culminates
into
a
favorite
flavor
combination
overall
not
bad
if
the
alcohol
content
was
a
bit
lower
this
would
be
a
good
session

classic

flavors
of

poured

has
an

a

some
sweetness

some
maltiness
an
excellent
beer
big
and
bold
in
the
hops
and
malt
department
with
a
large
dollop
of
toffee
sweetness
one
thing
i
noticed
in
particular
was
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
which
makes
it
more
of
a
beer
for
taking
your
time
over
especially
in
the
middle
of
a
rainy
afternoon
watching
the
rugby
was
very
good
with
dinner
and
had
we
not
be

i
definitely
would
have
had
another

its

this
is
a
beer
im
glad
to
have
available
i
see
why
my
professor
raves
about
this
one
rich
hearty
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the

hate

they
get
to

i
will
drink
again
this
poured
a
clear

it
smelled
like
nutty
malt
and
sweet
yeast
with
mild
citrus
hops
it
tasted
like
nutty
and
caramel
malt
with
earthy
yeast
and
copper
hops
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
much
bigger
taste
than
smell
which
was
a
pretty
good
flavor
but
it
was
generic
and
a
bit
dirty
it
had
pretty
good
body
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
it
was
just
not
very
rewarding
although
it
improved
as
it
warmed
d
high
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
that
puts
it
all
together
in
a

with
a
luscious
malt
backdrop
immediately
seduced
by
english
hop
varieties
pure
class
in
a
glass
d
great
to
drink
somewhat
complex
but
easy
to
down
thorougly
enjoyed
this
drop
delish
d
i
was
expecting
something
different
perhaps
not
for
it
to
be
so
sweet
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
and
will
have
to
stumble
down
the
block
soon
and
get
it
on
tap
taste
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
beer
a
bitter
smooth
and
malty
with
some
apple
flavor
i
think
that
the
apple
flavor
is
supposed
to
be
a
defect
in
beer
but
i
like
it
caramel
malts
and
light
toasted
sourdough
bread
over
herbal
bitter
hops
well
balanced
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
carbonated
and
a
tad
oily
in
the
mouth
a
pleasant
astringent
aftertaste
a
good
albeit
mediocre
esb
sessionable
nonetheless
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
hooked
on
craft
brew
and
is
truly
the
standard
for
this
particular
style
i
usually
pour
1
5
fullers
12
oz
bottles
into
an
english
pint
and
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
flavor
is
complex
with
mellow
english
hops
some
earth
tones
and
a
slight
toffee
flavor
all
play
into
the
mix
overall
the
drinkability
is
excellent
and
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
its
even
better
when
served
on
tap
highly
recommended
i
bought
it
because
i
was
told
it
is
the
one
true
esb
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
esb
under
my
belt
but
i
like
it
better
than
red
hooks
its
a
good
beer
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
sure
the
style
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
for
the
most
part
this
beer
strikes
a
good
balance
though
leans
towards
the
bitter
side
as
it
should
to
be
a
fairly
mild
ale
the
alcohol
hit
in
the
finish
is
a
little
unexpected
and
definitely
detracts
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
supurbly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
esb
with
a
rich
and
well
balanced
profile
aftertaste
is
rich
and
creamy
a
brilliant
esb
cheers
d
this
first
and
still
the
benchmark
for
the
style
i
love
this
beer
and
think
of
this
as
the
ultimate
english
session
ale
d
a
great
example
of
an
english
bitter
but
this
is
about
the
best
there
is
in
bottled
form
d
very
drinkable
flavorful
without
being
heavy
in
the
slightest
would
gladly
drink
this
any
time
d
a
well
balanced
bitterness
and
easy
consumption
makes
this
a
very
special
bitter
indeed
good
per
style
and
worthy
by
all
means
my
sample
seemed
particularly
fresh
from
the
international
beer
shop
west
leederville
ambercaramel
color
smells
fruity
and
hoppy
but
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
sort
of
like
a
hesitant
ipa
the
balance
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
im
sure
this
takes
a
lot
of
skill
to
perfect
i
wanted
to
like
this
i
really
did
but
this
was
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beers
ive
had
it
smelled
and
looked
alright
but
the
taste
was
so
bitter
and
rough
i
actually
couldnt
take
more
than
a
few
sips
and
i
had
to
pour
it
i
was
actually
gagging
i
tried
another
bottle
a
few
days
later
and
got
the
same
result
i
hope
i
just
bought
some
bad
bottles
because
this
seems
like
a
well
respected
historic
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
fullers
but
havent
had
the
esb
in
at
least
2
or
3
years
bitters
are
really
meant
to
be
drank
fresh
and
from
a
cask
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
malt
and
hops
are
well
balanced
and
both
have
a
complex
profile
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
im
most
definitely
having
again
easy
drinker
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
variety
to
keep
you
interested
throughout
did
a
minitasting
with
redhook
and
great
divide
esb
and
fullers
is
by
far
the
best
of
that
bunch
this
is
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
being
very
malty
and
semi
sweet
while
having
a
pronouced
bitterness
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
it
is
expensive
in
australia
but
most
definitely
worth
it
as
no
bitter
i
have
ever
tasted
comes
close
to
this
excellent
stuff
great
beer
that
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
d
very
very
drinkable
an
excellent
esb
i
hope
to
have
more
in
the
future
d
a
little
more
malty
than
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
beer
that
has
the
word
bitter
in
its
style
i
was
never
able
to
find
a
double
bock
that
i
liked
and
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
one
but
fixes
most
everything
i
disliked
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
interesting
malt
character
the
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
and
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
than
can
be
a
little
metallic
at
times
certain
characteristics
of
this
beer
come
through
as
world
class
but
little
annoyances
such
as
the
diacetyl
and
metallic
qualities
hold
it
back
i
understand
that
diacetyl
is
a
characteristic
of
the
style
but
at
times
it
doesnt
sit
comfortably
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
at
first
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
but
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
pint
bottle
i
had
i
began
to
enjoy
it
more
and
more
amber
colored
with
a
medium
foamy
head
but
it
lasts
throughout
the
entire
beer
and
forms
a
nice
amount
of
lace
somewhat
malty
aroma
and
a
little
fruity
malty
flavor
sour
with
crisp
hoppy
bitterness
rerate
8908
hand
pulled
at
the
frosty
mug
maybe
my
palate
has
changed
but
this
isnt
as
great
as
i
remembered
nice
creamy
head
and
lacing
more
malty
than
hoppy
caramel
a
bit
bready
with
light
bitterness
but
a
bit
thin
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
big
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
malty
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
big
and
lush
and
just
shy
of
chewy
overall
this
beer
has
great
balance
and
is
a
good
drinking
beer
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
high
price
i
would
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
at
the
bar
though
its
not
all
the
time
im
in
the
mood
for
an
esb
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
both
are
fairly
rugged
due
to
minerality
d
very
drinkable
finish
was
very
pleasing
a
nice
warming
esb
for
the
style
this
is
a
favorite
decided
to
try
this
from
the
tap
as
compared
to
the
bottle
very
different
tap
is
creamier
and
softer
i
like
this
one
and
could
put
a
couple
back
but
i
think
i
would
get
a
little
bored
after
a
few
worth
a
shot
a
decent
brew
m
d
soft
creamy
a
little
zing
of
carbonation
quite
smooth
this
is
an
astonishingly
easy
to
drink
beer
and
one
that
id
session
hands
down
excellent
this
beer
had
a
nice
reddishbrown
hue
to
it
good
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
of
course
there
is
a
bitter
kick
to
this
beer
but
its
surprisingly
balanced
with
a
certain
creaminess
that
adds
to
the
experience
admittedly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
variety
but
found
it
pretty
tasty
in
general
burntamber
orange
and
brown
color
cream
colored
short
head
malty
smell
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
earthy
bitter
hop
smell
bittersweet
taste
creamy
toffee
malt
lightly
buttery
bitter
hop
slightly
pine
slightly
earthy
this
stuff
is
going
down
pretty
quick
moderately
thin
yet
again
slightly
creamy
and
oily
sessionable
for
me
i
suggest
it
id
like
to
explore
more
bitters
after
this
a
very
good
pale
ale
but
not
the
standard
i
think
overall
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
with
a
crisp
mildly
bitter
finish
perfect
for
any
occasion
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
orange
color
with
a
frothy
and
long
lasting
tan
head
the
malty
aroma
is
complex
with
hints
of
caramel
and
butter
kinda
smells
like
a
lipton
brisk
ice
tea
the
taste
is
amazingly
rich
very
malty
and
sweet
with
slight
hop
flavor
light
metallic
flavor
weird
the
bitterness
is
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
but
still
nice
very
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
with
a
long
lasting
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
tell
me
that
this
is
an
authentic
esb
low
levels
of
carbonation
are
really
key
here
giving
this
beer
a
perception
that
it
is
a
cask
ale
this
is
one
ill
be
picking
up
again
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
and
esb
though
im
sure
ill
be
looking
for
others
to
try
as
well
this
is
a
damn
finelooking
beer
very
impressive
head
which
slowly
subsides
to
a
thick
film
of
bubbles
that
last
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
pint
a
good
dark
amber
colour
plenty
of
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
promise
of
hops
to
come
a
good
balance
of
both
in
the
taste
tending
towards
the
malty
sweetness
id
have
preferred
it
to
go
the
other
way
in
the
direction
of
the
hops
but
thats
merely
a
personal
preference
and
im
not
going
to
mark
it
down
for
that
this
is
a
very
wellbrewed
beer
i
do
have
to
take
off
half
a
point
for
the
mouthfeel
though
which
i
find
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
beer
as
good
as
this
i
think
the
body
should
be
a
few
dress
sizes
bigger
had
on
tap
at
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
a
good
dark
amber
appearance
with
minimal
lacing
and
a
thin
head
throughout
aromas
were
typically
malty
and
a
slight
nutlike
flavoring
definitely
roasty
tastes
were
creamy
and
balanced
really
well
executed
pretty
sweet
as
well
the
mouthfeel
helped
a
lot
in
making
this
an
enjoyably
light
and
creamy
beverage
overall
pretty
good
d
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
bitter
i
can
see
why
it
receives
the
acclaim
that
it
does
definitely
sets
a
standard
and
makes
most
bitters
that
ive
had
in
the
past
a
few
strokes
under
par
another
selection
from
the
new
local
pub
that
is
attracting
beer
lovers
in
droves
served
in
an
imperial
pint
20
oz
color
is
dark
bronze
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
smell
is
rich
and
malty
with
slight
earthy
tones
like
peat
taste
is
a
smooth
bitterness
followed
by
a
sweetness
accompanied
by
the
bitterness
still
lingering
and
a
nutty
flavored
finish
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
brew
d
a
great
esb
that
ive
been
looking
for
i
bought
a
6
and
drank
several
not
all
in
a
row
before
finally
sitting
down
to
write
the
review
this
tells
me
ill
be
keeping
this
stocked
in
my
fridge
so
long
as
i
can
afford
it
fulers
esb
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
with
its
distinctive
colour
and
taste
with
a
wonderful
hint
of
marmalade
to
give
it
a
slight
sweetness
i
like
all
of
the
fullers
brands
and
i
live
a
couple
miles
from
there
impressive
brewery
and
with
esb
there
may
be
many
imitations
but
only
one
original
i
like
fullers
a
lot
the
only
problem
is
their
beer
is
on
the
high
end
of
the
price
scale
so
it
is
rare
that
i
get
to
enjoy
them
as
often
as
id
like
this
esb
is
nearly
perfect
nice
deep
amber
color
and
a
strong
molasses
aroma
are
perfect
complements
to
the
sweet
roasted
flavor
complex
like
a
good
scotch
but
much
easier
to
drink
a
really
great
beer
highly
recommended
d

great
drinker
hope
to
have
this
in
the
fridge
in
the
near
future
d
decently
drinkable
just
too
malty
sweet
and
rich
for
me
i
would
like
it
a
little
more
bitter
and
dry
but
i
am
not
going
to
try
and
reinvent
the
wheel
either
for
me
this
is
a
benchmark
of
what
an
esb
ought
to
be
really
smooth
and
drinkable
with
great
flavors
from
all
the
ingredients
a
nice
medium
body
and
all
in
good
harmony
d
great
alone
or
with
food
makes
a
good

d
very
good

pretty
good
esb
indeed
loads
of
flavor
impressive

more
nuttiness
butterscotch
on
the
palate
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
and
well
balanced

not
bad
d
definitely
a
drinkable
brewi
put
this
one
down
very
quickly
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
but
not
an
ideal
session
beer
for
mei
gotta
have
my
hops
simple
and
refreshing
and
well
done
all
round
notes
not
especially
bitter
and
i
am
glad
for
that
good
beeri
hope
to
enjoy
more
of
this
style
d
definite
sessionability
here
one
goes
down
very
quickly
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
but
i
prefer
more
complexity
d
a
really
pleasant
experience
as
it
went
down
very
nicely
im
looking
forward
to
another
one
another
keeper
from
fullers
d
extraordinarily
drinkable
a
brilliant
example
of
the
style
i
now
understand
the
potential
of
an
esb
and
what
it
should
truly
represent
if
as
their
label
boasts
fullers
have
given
us
the
original
esb
then
we
are
presented
with
a
case
of
the
source
never
being
outstripped
by
its
scions
this
beer
is
incredibly
more
refined
and
wellrounded
than
any
american
esb
ive
ever
had
all
of
which
usually
seem
by
comparison
to
be
overly
hoppy
and
bitter
simply
for
the
sake
of
the
hops
and
bitterness
fullers
on
the
other
hand
utilises
the
hops
and
bitterness
to
a
completepicture
end
it
gives
them
a
purpose
and
a
meaning
and
has
something
to
say
with
them
i
drank
this
with
an
amazing
pork
tenderloin
dish
at
the
purple
onion
café
in
saluda
nc
and
the
pairing
was
spoton
d
very
drinkable
finishes
with
a
nice
sweetness
but
not
cloying
di
wish
i
had
another
one
of
theseclassic
example
of
english
esb
i
am
sure
there
is
more
of
this
in
my
future
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
great
very
sessionable
very
english
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
its
very
english
very
subtle
it
dint
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
can
be
recommended
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
style
that
has
been
steadily
growing
on
me
and
this
beer
is
a
nice
one
that
i
could
drink
for
a
long
time
2
thoughts
the
esb
i
last
had
and
know
best
is
from
rogue
im
used
to
the
american
stlye
so
this
is
maybe
too
subtle
for
me
which
leads
me
to
my
next
thought
not
so
fresh
everything
ive
read
on
ba
leads
me
to
believe
this
beer
is
well
deserving
of
its
high
score
although
perhaps
i
didnt
get
the
freshest
sample
id
really
like
to
try
it
fresh
on
tap
d
a
very
drinkable
classic
example
of
the
style
the
malt
character
is
particularly
enjoyable
d
an
excellent
session
beer
this
is
great
on
its
own
and
would
be
great
with
a
meal
with
its
full
flavors
and
rich
texture
i
would
fill
up
on
this
beer
so
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
but
other
than
that
this
one
definately
ranks
up
there
one
of
my
faves
for
sure
d
one
of
the
best
of
the
fullers
offerings
and
a
classic
example
of
this
very
english
style
this
beer
is
surely
deserving
of
its
reputation
and
was
even
better
on
cask
fullers
esb
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
the
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
it
is
lightly
carbonated
and
rolls
nicely
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
nice
blending
of
hops
and
malt
the
flavour
is
just
bitter
enough
to
be
great
the
beer
poured
with
a
small
white
head
and
an
amber
body
the
smell
was
a
muted
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
featured
a
bit
less
hop
flavor
than
id
expect
for
the
style
allowing
the
strong
malt
flavor
to
come
through
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
considering
the
somewhat
high
abv
served
in
a
imperial
pint
glass
reddishbrown
in
color
quite
clear
smell
is
of
malt
taste
is
malty
buttery
with
a
hint
of
tea
from
the
hops
you
get
an
earthy
character
bitterness
levels
are
excellent
clean
tasting
and
match
up
well
to
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
rich
carbonation
levels
are
slightly
high
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
drink
several
of
these
esbs
this
is
an
excellent
ale
from
fullers
i
just
wish
i
could
have
it
from
the
cask
rather
than
the
keg
appearance
was
gold
with
reasonable
head
that
stayed
for
a
little
while
dunno
about
smell
much
but
i
did
get
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
had
a
nice
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
complement
the
slight
malt
and
caramel
there
was
some
fruitiness
that
ive
come
to
associate
with
english
beers
very
drinkable
this
is
what
it
is
a
classic
for
a
reason
wonderful
beer
coppery
and
clear
with
only
faint
carbonation
good
hoppy
notes
off
the
head
but
not
huge
flavour
is
well
balanced
with
toffee
malt
and
well
integrated
hop
bitterness
i
drank
this
straight
after
a
spitfire
and
though
its
not
as
big
in
flavour
or
aroma
its
got
better
body
and
a
little
better
balance
i
like
this
a
lot
but
its
pretty
dear
in
oz
i
dont
think
ive
tasted
one
of
these
since
i
first
started
really
appreciating
good
beer
four
or
five
years
ago
i
was
impressed
then
and
remain
so
now
the
balance
and
fullness
of
flavor
are
unparalleled
for
the
style
big
caramel
malts
provide
a
sturdy
base
for
the
earthy
hop
bitterness
finish
is
dry
and
sits
well
great
beer
i
love
a
good
esb
to
me
it
is
a
totally
underappreciated
style
and
this
one
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
delivering
a
very
pleasing
wellbalanced
brew
a
great
session
beer
find
and
drink
this
beer
if
you
havent
already
well
this
is
a
classic
for
the
style
isnt
it
its
a
good
solid
beer
to
drink
it
does
not
reinvent
the
wheel
but
it
certainly
keeps
the
good
time
rolling
cheesy
i
know
d
tremendously
balanced
good
taste
excellent
mouthfeel
reasonable
alcohol
content
a
perfect
session
beer
the
color
is
copper
with
a
slight
head
smells
of
malt
grains
and
a
bit
tart
the
first
taste
is
bitter
rich
and
malty
but
bitter
nothing
really
outstanding
about
this
beer
thinking
that
it
may
be
extra
bitter
because
of
its
age
an
average
drinkable
beer
d
an
well
balanced
easy
drinking
and
tasty
esb
you
really
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
though
theres
nothing
to
dislike
about
this
beer
d
great
drink
can
enjoy
one
after
the
other
d
outstanding
i
could
do
this
one
all
night
and
not
get
bored
at
all
ive
tried
one
of
my
bottles
since
and
it
was
just
as
good
fear
not
if
you
see
this
one
for
it
is
a
wonderful
beer
d
very
easily
drinkable
ale
an
easily
sessionable
beer
and
very
easily
drinkable
by
many
different
people
a
really
great
example
of
the
style
verdict
whoever
said
that
a
bitter
couldnt
be
a
good
session
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
its
simple
and
yet
fulfilling
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
from
a
tap
at
5
9
classic
notes
biscuity
flavor
reminds
me
of
sixpoints
sweet
action
d
one
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
not
really
a
session
beer
but
im
still
glad
i
have
another
bomber
in
the
fridge
11
2
oz
slender
bottle
copped
from
buy
rite
in
south
plainfield
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
particular
beer
and
brewery
and
this
sample
certainly
lives
up
to
its
hype
nice
coppercolored
appearance
with
minimal
head
leads
to
a
decent
aroma
of
bittersweet
hops
citrus
and
fresh
florals
taste
strongly
complements
the
aroma
with
a
noticeable
bittersweet
hop
flavor
bursting
through
along
with
citrus
grapefruit
and
grains
a
very
good
depiction
of
the
style
that
is
easily
drinkable
without
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
setting
flavor
was
uncloying
and
subtle
yet
really
flavorful
with
a
strong
mouthfeel
certainly
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
sampled
good
stuff
definitely
recommended
more
copper
clearish
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mostly
caramel
like
malt
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
times
with
the
caramel
tastes
like
lightly
bitter
smooth
liquid
caramel
almost
a
light
burnt
sugar
taste
because
of
the
light
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
preferred
style
this
beverage
just
has
classy
all
over
it
for
a
brew
this
full
it
sure
does
go
down
easy
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
and
im
really
liking
it
the
flavors
stay
solid
throughout
the
experience
and
it
just
seems
to
get
better
with
every
pull
so
far
i
havent
been
disappointed
with
a
fullers
product
d
this
is
a
fine
brew
gotta
have
it
on
tap
though
recommended
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
what
i
would
hold
to
be
an
exemplar
of
the
esb
style
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
this
is
well
in
the
the
session
range
big
props
to
the
guys
from
the
craft
beer
radio
podcast
for
hyping
this
beer
well
before
the
freshness
date
this
is
a
fine
beer
a
damn
fine
session
beer
just
another
solid
brew
by
fullers
great
sessionability
almost
perfect
hop
to
malt
balance
fruity
yet
so
toffee
malty
bitterness
is
sustained
on
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
citrus
bright
lively
carbonation
really
helps
out
in
the
overall
showing
of
this
beer
i
like
this
much
better
on
draught
but
eithe
way
a
sure
winner
rereview
2009
i
want
to
bump
the
taste
score
to
4
5
im
fully
6
months
away
from
the
best
by
date
on
this
beer
or
id
be
tempted
to
call
it
an
aged
bottle
is
it
the
same
as
it
was
fresh
i
doubt
it
do
i
love
it
anyway
absolutely
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
mostly
nice
sweet
malts
and
some
toffee
the
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
toasty
malts
that
is
cut
by
just
a
little
hop
bite
and
leading
to
even
more
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
pleasant
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
a
great
example
of
the
style
picked
up
a
single
to
see
how
i
would
like
this
after
a
few
years
of
not
having
it
it
didnt
disappoint
still
a
great
beer
now
if
i
could
only
find
some
london
porter
around
here
perfectly
clear
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
toasty
caramel
malt
aroma
flavor
is
of
toasted
malt
with
caramel
undertones
slight
bittering
from
the
hops
medium
body
with
a
slick
smooth
presence
on
the
palate
finishes
crisp
and
clean
with
a
slightly
lingering
stickiness
a
definitively
sessionable
brew

2

with
a
2
to
3
cm
white
head
that
is
quickly
diminishing
aroma
is
very
light
mostly
caramel
flavor
is
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
but
lasting
great
lacing
no
noted
carbonation
no
hints
of
alcohol
very
drinkable
but
i
would
prefer
the
london
pride
over
this
selection
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
whim
and
wasnt
disappointed
a
solid
beer
all
over
and
also
a
good
esb
by
style
definition
id
recommend
pairing
it
with
some
fries
with
malt
vinegar
thrashers
for
example
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumblker
at
50
degrees
the
beere
was
a
pretty
wood
risin
color
the
bber
had
a
fine
bubbly
head
but
went
awat
pretty
fast
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
i
thought
a
bit
sour
however
i
was
pleased
the
tase
was
not
in
fact
it
was
a
nice
rich
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
nuttyness
ther
was
just
so
ever
a
hoppy
note
but
not
bad
in
the
least
i
like
this
breww
and
am
going
back
to
get
the
rest
in
the
store
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
esb
it
is
bitter
but
there
is
also
a
lot
of
flavor
and
good
balance
between
sweeter
nuttier
malt
flavor
and
the
hops
sharper
bitter
tones
another
great
fuller
beer
this
is
one
that
should
not
be
missed
pours
nice
clear
copper
touch
of
a
haze
very
large
thick
head
2
fingers
with
lots
of
lace
staying
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
lots
of
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fruit
in
the
nose
also
some
citrus
hop
flavoring
taste
is
dominated
with
malt
sweetness
earth
tones
along
with
a
large
amount
of
grain
flavors
hence
the
name
lots
of
good
hop
bite
towards
the
finish
kent
goldings
and
fuggles
flavors
hops
linger
after
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
clean
full
mouth
feel
extremely
drinkable
excellent
representation
of
the
syle
quelque
peu
déçu
vu
le
prix
de
la
bouteille
d
pretty
solid
ale
not
as
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
but
the
maltiness
made
up
for
it
overall
refreshing
and
light
with
very
well
disguised
alcohol
i
must
say
that
this
bottle
that
i
rated
was
not
how
i
remembered
esb
from
the
cask
i
think
perhaps
that
this
bottle
was
a
little
offish
im
almost
tempted
to
increase
the
rating
based
on
my
past
experience
of
this
beer
but
i
will
leave
it
for
now
and
rerate
when
i
try
it
again
flavor
is
much
better
complex
for
such
a
low
abv
brew
bonus
points
toasted
malts
and
caramellite
toffee
some
raisin
very
low
brown
malts
mix
into
the
earthy
hops
from
there
the
lite
spicy
hops
finish
with
a
lingering
pale
malt
palate
suprisingly
lite
butterscotch
bigger
body
than
expected
very
drinkable
for
an
experienced
beer
drinker
but
i
believe
if
you
were
trying
to
convert
a
macro
person
it
would
be
a
hard
sell
just
too
much
going
on
to
be
saleable
to
an
inexperienced
palate
that
being
said
i
need
to
pick
up
the
fullers
more
often
i
often
dont
because
of
the
increased
ticket
price
but
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
i
probably
should
be
enjoying
more
english
brews
very
drinkable
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
if
not
the
best
medium
body
very
soft
on
the
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
classic
session
beer
overall
very
sophisticated
well
crafted
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
english
bitters
notes
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
brew
was
my
first
venture
into
esbs
and
it
was
a
good
one
to
start
with
had
this
one
to
go
with
a
lunch
in
a
city
pub
the
food
battered
cod
and
chips
wasnt
worth
the
mention
however
the
brew
was
a
medium
to
full
bodied
strongly
flavored
ale
with
quite
strong
bitterness
quite
strong
in
alcohol
too
which
you
will
not
feel
while
drinking
perhaps
afterwards
pours
the
deepest
shade
of
copper
burnished
and
gleaming
head
is
big
and
billowing
just
a
shade
off
of
white
and
leaving
great
lacing
behind
surfacing
carbonation
leaves
trails
of
bubbles
running
up
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
bang
on
esb
as
one
would
expect
from
the
archetype
of
them
all
light
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
with
breadiness
and
nuts
a
hint
of
light
fruits
and
berries
taste
is
more
of
the
same
malty
at
first
the
toffee
and
butter
come
first
and
lead
into
a
dry
nuttiness
hops
arent
assertive
but
theyre
everpresent
and
provide
the
lightest
spicycitrus
backdrop
to
everything
finish
is
nice
and
long
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
plenty
of
body
with
great
levels
of
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
perfect
an
excellent
beer
and
deserving
of
its
reputation
drinkability
enjoyable
my
first
esb
i
am
hoping
that
this
is
not
my
last
but
it
is
certainly
a
pleasant
first
experience
a
pleasant
and
nonabrasive
brew
after
the
beers
warms
up
a
bit
the
taste
mellows
out
quite
a
bit
to
make
this
a
great
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
more
so
than
to
begin
with
if
possible
belle
couleur
cuivré
la
mousse
est
blanche
consistante
au
début
mais
se
dissipe
assez
rapidement
le
goût
est
parfaitement
équilibré
entre
le
malt
et
les
houblons
la
finale
houblonnée
est
particulierement
bonne
et
longue
un
classique
dans
le
genre
this
beer
is
pretty
darned
good
give
it
a
try
if
you
happen
upon
it
i
may
have
to
try
it
again
just
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
one
or
that
it
needs
to
grow
on
you
d
very
drinkable
enjoyed
this
very
much
the
drinkability
was
surprisingly
good
due
again
to
its
balance
i
agree
with
a
previous
post
that
you
could
drink
these
in
a
session
quite
easilly
although
the
higher
abv
compared
to
london
pride
lends
itself
to
being
a
comforting
beer
for
an
esb
man
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
i
am
no
fan
of
most
english
beers
but
this
one
is
a
thing
of
beauty
great
session
brew
you
can
down
50
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
not
get
sick
of
it
pours
a
decent
head
disappates
quite
quickly
not
much
lacing
nice
nice
bittering
hops
at
the
end
with
a
fruity
almost
cherry
like
maltiness
with
a
slight
nutty
palate
as
well
smells
of
some
toasty
almonds
and
cherries
and
bittering
hops
an
all
around
terrific
beer
a
drinkable
brew
but
its
too
rich
and
robust
to
be
very
sessionable
im
also
not
much
on
the
style
so
perhaps
its
an
acquired
taste
still
a
very
nice
brew
anywho
it
has
a
good
thickish
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
is
light
good
stuff
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
brilliant
it
is
a
complex
melange
of
sorts
and
it
is
an
interesting
ale
well
worth
trying
out
it
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
decent
head
and
some
retention
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
lots
of
toasted
caramel
amber
malts
and
dryness
the
smell
reminds
me
of
newcastle
but
it
is
a
much
better
variation
overall
the
taste
is
widely
complex
it
begins
with
a
toasted
maltiness
bready
sweet
caramel
and
some
interesting
sweet
malts
the
taste
segues
into
a
more
burnt
caramel
taste
more
dryish
on
the
palate
more
firm
bodied
it
finishes
being
much
hoppier
bitter
more
a
traditional
style
british
ale
the
aftertaste
does
linger
quite
awhile
the
beer
is
pretty
substantial
medium
bodied
moderately
carbonated
and
quite
heavy
on
the
tongue
in
parts
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
for
no
other
reason
than
its
complexity
and
nice
finish
lchaim
d
it
really
is
one
of
the
best
esbs
around
just
great
flavor
and
it
is
easy
drinking
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
the
trademark
of
the
style
and
loved
it
everything
was
well
done
it
helped
it
was
nice
and
fresh
a
best
by
date
of
may
2008
ill
buy
this
again
and
strive
to
make
something
close
even
fairly
close
will
be
delicious
this
is
a
solid
english
ale
every
bit
as
good
today
as
it
was
the
first
time
i
sampled
it
in
london
while
in
the
army
back
in
75
just
an
exceptional
esb
from
fuller
i
drank
two
pints
with
brunch
and
enjoyed
it
a
lot
its
a
fine
esb
better
than
say
redhooks
this
is
an
esb
that
seems
to
do
everything
right
the
appearance
leans
more
toward
the
dark
copper
tint
making
it
very
appealing
to
the
eyes
the
smell
is
about
average
not
really
giving
off
much
aroma
tasting
this
beer
is
a
very
balanced
experience
with
a
somewhat
malty
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
was
exceptional
with
just
the
right
amount
of
body
this
beer
is
a
drinkable
beer
mainly
on
those
cold
nights
not
really
on
a
hot
day
a
tasty
hoporiented
british
ale
id
prefer
a
touch
more
malt
to
balance
but
its
plenty
good
asis
revisiting
a
personal
favorite
before
the
psu
brew
fest
solid
amber
body
with

i

wrong
this
is
a
different
beast
all
together
and
is
a
very
strong
bitter
this
a
beer
worth
recommending
overall
the
opinion
i
had
was
ill
founded
this
was
actually
a
pretty
decent
brew
very
sweet
flavor
which
suprised
me
and
had
a
good
session
quality
about
it
i
would
not
mind
ordering
this
up
anywhere
really
will
have
to
try
some
of
the
others
as
well
thanks
ric
ger
d
great
sessionability
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
with
straightforward
hops
and
bitterness
make
it
quite
easy
to
drink
just
a
good
ale
here
not
much
else
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
easily
quaffable
you
could
stay
on
this
particular
bitter
all
night
a
little
taste
of
england
in
these
here
united
states
this
is
the
hallmark
of
the
style
and
pretty
much
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
certainly
one
of
the
beers
i
drink
the
most
just
wish
it
was
a
little
less
expensive
4
a
pint
bottle
but
youd
do
worse
in
a
bar
wow
i
cant
believe
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
try
this
beer
i
must
say
this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
this
is
a
topnotch
ale
and
one
i
would
be
glad
to
drink
any
time
it
is
definitely
about
the
maltiness
pour
me
another
one
please
d
a
very
fine
beer
deserving
of
its
reputation
slightly
strong
for
sessiondrinking
but
excellent
flavors
superb
balance
a
winner
all
around
and
one
ill
certainly
have
again
d

medium
i
could
have
a
few
d
this
was
pretty
good
and
pretty
drinkable
it
was
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
but
it
was
a
good
balanced
beer
i
will
probably
have
this
one
again
poured
a
very
clear
pale
reddish
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
there
were
some
small
yeast
particles
suspended
in
solution
since
i
poured
the
whole
bottle
the
smell
was
toasted
malt
and
sweet
strong
caramel
presence
in
the
taste
the
bitterness
is
quite
low
and
not
much
hops
come
through
the
drinkability
is
actually
pretty
good
though
as
you
may
find
yourself
drinking
this
one
pretty
fast
i
wouldnt
spend
too
much
time
with
it
though
at
5
9
abv
this
esb
was
surprisingly
sessionable
ive
got
mixed
feelings
on
this
one
but
its
hard
to
tell
if
it
had
bad
handling
in
transit
the
malt
flavor
just
seemed
a
little
off
a
bit
medicinal
or
plastic
still
there
was
the
nice
subtle
malt
and
hops
flavors
that
make
a
great
esb
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
overall
id
try
it
again
drinkability
a
very
fine
beer
but
the
higher
alcohol
content
5
9
percent
would
keep
this
from
being
a
session
beer
for
me
deep
red
brown
in
color
with
no
real
head
smell
is
hoppy
and
sweet
there
is
a
caramel
note
that
just
makes
me
want
to
pour
it
over
ice
cream
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
hops
dominate
but
the
bitterness
refreshes
more
than
it
puckers
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
light
but
not
watery
drinkability
is
damn
good
for
something
this
hoppy
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
get
it
on
tap
if
you
can
fullers
esb
is
bright
amber
with
orange
hues
a
sweet
gummy
beer
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
raisins
and
pine
theres
also
a
little
tropical
fruit
and
chocolate
in
it
maltiness
is
detectable
but
all
the
other
byflavors
overpower
it
very
creamy
and
satin
smoothness
from
the
olde
ships
taps
good
stuff
was
able
to
have
this
brew
on
tap
which
was
nice
as
i
normally
only
see
it
in
bottles
it
had
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
fairly
good
sized
light
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
some
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nice
malt
is
the
first
thing
that
i
notice
which
seem
to
give
of
a
scent
of
caramel
while
also
having
a
pretty
clear
hop
smell
that
seems
to
catch
up
the
hop
aroma
really
makes
you
think
that
this
is
a
classic
english
beer
with
the
challenger
northdown
and
golding
hops
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
as
it
has
a
very
smooth
feel
with
taste
highlights
of
caramel
nuts
and
additional
malt
flavors
noticeable
upfront
and
carrying
through
to
the
end
around
the
middle
i
notice
the
hops
which
give
it
a
nice
accompanying
flavor
while
they
seem
to
try
to
take
over
a
little
bit
over
all
this
is
a
very
good
brew
one
that
is
an
english
classic
not
my
favorite
syle
but
about
as
good
as
this
style
gets
not
tried
this
style
very
often
but
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
start
on
perfectly
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
highly
drinkable
and
another
reason
fullers
selection
are
jumping
up
my
list
of
favorites
poured
from
a
25oz
bottle
into

the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
forming
a
creamy
12
inch
head
spots
of
light
lace
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
fruit
and
caramel
from
the
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
followed
by
smooth
caramel
and
finishing
with
a
slight
fruit
finish
medium
smooth
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
and
with
the
low

this
is
a
great
session

d
its

good
for

on
about
any
occassion
i
was
reminded
to
try
this
after
tasting
another
beer
which
was
benchmarked
by
this
esb
i
liked
this
very
much
and
i
would
like
to
find
this
on
tap
or
even
better
on
cask
im
not
generally
a
huge
fan
of
these
subdued
british
styles
but
this
is
ridiculously
sessionable
liver
notwithstanding
one
person
could
put
away
a
case
of
these
in
a
night
medium
bodied
and
extremely
drinkable

may
very
well

the
most
sessionable

bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
rich
amber
leaning
toward
red
big
bubbles
in
the
head
which
does
not
retain
well
the
beautiful
color
of
this
beer
would
earn
it
a
better
appearance
score
were
it
not
for
the
nearcomplete
lack
of
any
lacing
the
first
whiff
is
dried
fruit
with
a
very
subtle
tartness
and
astringency
these
aromas
subside
as
a
complex
maltiness
reveals
itself
on
the
back
half
of
my
tongue
lightly
roasted
malt
is
complimented
by
a
sweet
earthy
flavor
and
the
understated
hops
are
obviously
doing
quite
a
balancing
act
a
surprisingly
light
mouthfeel
contrasts
with
the
rich
but
not
overpowering
flavors
of
fullers
esb
making
it
extremely
drinkable
and
ill
second
whoever
said
that
even
at
5
9
abv
this
could
still
do
nicely
in
sessions
albeit
very
hazy
ones
overall
a
good
beer
although
im
not
quite
sold
on
english
beers
ill
definately
have
to
try
it
again
this
was
one
of
my
first
favourites
but
in
recent
times
it
has
dropped
in
quality
but
until
i
can
rerate
i
will
go
with
my
original
gangster
review
a
brilliant
dark
bitter
beer
that
looks
great
but
lacks
alot
of
head
it
has
a
full
flavor
and
good
after
taste
one
of
my
favs
dont
look
before
you
laugh
this
is
unbelievably
good
goes
down
smooth
and
at
5
9
it
might
still
be
bordering
on
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
several
bottles
of
this
for
sure
this
is
a
very
bitter
beer
and
definitely
recommended
if
you
enjoy
the
bitterness
can
be
a
bit
much
for
some
but
i
sure
enjoyed
it
there
are
strong
notes
of
diacetyl
in
this
brew
which
is
largely
evident
in
the
buttery
flavors
but
it
is
of
course
intended
and
really
gives
this
beer
a
great
character
and
i
really
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
an
true
english

a

ive
had
this
beer
on

and
it
tastes
exactly
the
same
that
says
a
lot
about
one
or
the
other
im
inclined
to
say
that
fullers
does
an
exceptional
job
at
bottling
it
is
a
good
beer
just
being
served
in
a
suboptimum
medium

a
clear
amber
with
a
very
nice
fluffy
head
that
sticks
nicely
to
the
sides
of
the

has
a
nice

sweetness
with
a
touch

taste

a
touch
of

this
brew
is

ridiculously
drinkable

of
my
favorites

just
a
superb
example
of
an
esb
a

just
a
great
and
simple

beer
in
my
opinion
its
a
great
if
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
a
fantastic
beer
overall
i
would
very
much
like
to
try
the
unfiltered

of
this

failing
that
at

a

has

it
has
about

that
retains
pretty

is
a

the

is

leaving
the

with

now
this
is
what
i
remember
bitter
to
taste
like
when
i
was
in
the
uk
sitting
in
a
pub
drinking
pint
after
pint
not
the
over
hopped
american
versions
this
is
what
bitter
should
be
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
that
finishes
clean
and
dry
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
all
night
i
need
to
find
this

i
had
this

in

into

it

an

with
one

of
head
that
dies
down
to
a
little
ring
pretty
quickly
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
seems
to
be
a
mix
of
caramel
pine
and
hops
the
taste
is
a
good
bite
of
hops
but
not
so
much
as
an
ipa
with
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
spicy
flavors
together
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
but
this
is
still
a
smooth
ale
with
a
good
drinkability

you

this

quickly
backs
off
and
finishes
smooth
and
lets
you
appreciate
its
complex
character
more
than

this
smoothness
lends
to

esb

one
of
the

ales
it
seems
to
have
been
somewhat

some
of
the
more
hopped
american
micros
and
some
have
stated
that
it
is
superior
in
the
u
k
if
so
i
would
love
to
try
it
because
i
love
this
beer
as
is
the
smoothness
is
unmatched
in
an
ale
and
the
wonderful
winelike
flavor
stands
out
just
bitter
enough
without
overdoing
it
i
have
never
once
been
disappointed
when
ive
bought
esb
much
copied
but
still
the
best
this
sample
poured
from
cask
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
white
foam
the
smell
was
an
aromatic
hop
aroma
with
a
good
bit
of
malt
the
taste
was
malty
but
with
a
good
dose
of
floral
hops
and
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
extremely
smooth
and
clean
with
a
good

the
body
was

modest
carbonation

was

with
a
smallish
head
the
original
but
not
my
favorite
of

style
by
any
means
too
malty
in
my
opinion
the
chewy
malt
flavors
are
however
well
balanced
by
a
nice
crisp
hop
sensation
a
very
nice
beer
perhaps
im
too
bias
towards
the
overhopped
american
versions
of
this
style
to
fully
enjoy
this
beer
for
what
it
is
a
beautiful
amberish
teak

with
a
rich
full
malty
body
and
light
wood
notes
wonderful

some

very

has

the
taste
is

a

that
rounds
out
with

and
a

theres
alot
of
bitterness
to
this
and
alot
of
punch
very
indicitive
to
the
style
this
can
be
a

beer
but
the
5
9
sneaks
up
on
you
soon
after
taking
many
swigs
which
is
easy
to
do
cuz
this
stuff
is
pretty
darn
smooth
for
being
pretty
darn
bitter
its
a
very
clear
copper
color
with
some
gold
mixed
in
for
good
measure
the
head
is
large
at
first
but
very
quickly
dissipates
a
mellow
hoppy
aroma
is
a
wonderful
greeting
fullers
beer
always
has
the
best
aromas
the
hops
come
through
in
the
flavor
of
course
kind
of
similar
to
the
london
pride
in
a
way
but
also
unique
the
maltiness
comes
first
then
a
hoppy
finish
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
bitterness
isnt
overpowering
but
definitely
solid
much
to
my
liking
since
im
not
much
for
overthetop
hops
fullers
is
one
awesome
brewery
all
of
their
beers
are
amazing
try
them
all
and
expect
your
senses
to
be
treated
like
royalty
this
is
a
great
brew
from
start
to
finish
nice
sweet
malts
are
at
the
start
i
expected
a
much
hoppier
flavor
the
hops
to
come
in
nicely
but
i
expected
more
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bit
more
bitter
and
spicy
the
aftertaste
brings
in
a
bit
of
that
bitterness
i
was
looking
for
but
not
at
a
huge
level
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
near
perfect
the
flavors
dont
blend
but
perform
more
of
a
kamaeleon
sp
like
act
changing
from
malts
to
hops
the
body
is
medium
with
a
pretty
hearty
flavor
complexity
is
at
a
decent
level
it
is
very
drinkable
and
overall
very
enjoyable
fullers
has
done
a
great

on
every
brew
i
have

from
them
including
this
one
pretty
good
esb
easy
drinking
but
i
have
others
that
i
like
more
and
pay
less
for
fullers
esb
it
kind
of
sets
the
bar
for
the
esb
flavor
one
that
many
american
brewers
try
to
emulate
this
beer
looks
great
in
a
glass
i
pity
the
person
who
might
think
to
drink
it
out

quite
malty

ill
come
back
to
this
one
time
and
time
again
a
good
session
beer
too
although
its
a
bit
pricey
in
the
boston
area
still
absolutely
great
my
wife
insisted
i
try
this
she
claimed
it
was
the
hardest
to
find
beer
in
northern
new
england
the
original
esb
poured
well
not
great
carbonation
though
it
was
bitter
but
not
as
good
as
i
exspected
i
bet
this
beer
kicks
ass
on
tap
i
will
be
looking
for
it
at
first
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
of
this
beer
while
the
initial
taste
is
not
what
i
usually
expect
from
an
esb
there
was
still
a
good
hop
bite
on
the
finish
if
the
rich
amber
color
of
the
beer
doesnt
do
the
trick
the
first
sip
of
the
beer
will
take
you
straight
to
a
dark
low
ceiling
pub
in
britain
the
malty
and
almost
fruity
yeast
flavor
are
a
real
treat
and
really
should
only
be
enjoyed
on
draught
an
imperial
pint
glass
is
the
perfect
vessel
for
this
beer
throughout
the
balance
is
admirable
yet
the
maltiness
is
up
front
in
the
character
of
this
brew
classically
english
this
brew
evidences
the
reverse
of
the
american
pale
ales
where
the
hops
dominate
this
to
my
mind
results
in
a
more
comforting
mellow
ale
great
for
a
session
beer
a
world
classic
that
we
should
all
return
to
if
weve
been
away
sampling
newer
brews
with
more
bells
and
whistles
excellent
brewing
if
i
were
living
in
england
this
beer
would
be
my
daily
session
beer
it
is
just
so
amazing
in
the
sense
that
it
is
so
balanced
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
that
i
dont
think
i
could
pass
up
an
opportunity
to
sip
on
this
one
especially
on
nitro
this
beer
pours
cream
toned
head
that
along
with
the
deep
ruby
amber
hue
looked
magnificant
in
the
fullers
imperial
pint

this
beer
had
a
really
smooth
hop
character
that
blends
perfectly
with
the
sweetness
it
offers
the
drinker
a
creamy
full
mouthfeel
forms
with
each
sip
and
the
flavors
are
full
of
hop
bittering

a
great

could
not
ask

the

was

cant

had
this

copper

with
a
not

it
wasnt

bitter
it
was
still

im

not

bloody
as

atop
its
rich
caramel
maltiness
and
then
slowly
falls
away
to
a
dry
bitter
and
hoppy
finish
that
showcases
the
earthy
grassy
and
leafy
hop
character
that
runs
throughout
a
very
bold
beer
with
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
lots
of
brash
bitter
hops
and
yet
its
incredibly
balanced
and
rather
easy
to
drink

beer

overall
one
of
the
better
esbs
that
i
have
tired
this
copper
colored
ale
shows
nice
clarity
and
pours
with
a
strong
head
with
excellent
retention
and
develops
a
nice
rocky
quality
as
it
subsides
the
lace
clings
to
the
glass
and
refuses
to
slide
down
content
to
stay
put
throughout
the
entire
glass
the
aroma
is
almost
all
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
hops
to
lend
a
spicy
note
the
taste
is
exquisite
with
a
very
pronounced
caramel
sweetness
like
i
have
never
tasted
before
there
is
some
nice
hop
spice
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
lingering
but
very
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thick
but
it
matches
the
flavor
profile
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
as
this
glass
went
down
very
quickly
and
left
me
craving
more
this
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
which
quickly
settles
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
mild
very
malty
in
aroma
and
flavor
some
sweetness
with
mostly
carmel
malt
but
some
toasted
malt
flavor
also
sneaks
through
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
and
some
floral
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
not
very
bitter
for
an
esb
but
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
was
lucky
to
get
the
draught
version
dark
amber
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
hops
aroma
very
conspicuous
on
the
scale
of
esbs
i
have
had
this
was
better
than
average
but
it
doesnt
beat
the
crooked
river
i
had
not
too
long
ago
it
just
didnt
have
the
bitterness
i
was
expecting
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
the
london
pride
has
more
bite
there
is
more
malt
in
the
mix
here
which
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
just
less
esb
than
i
was
expecting
all
that
aside
this
is
still
a
good
beer
the
pour
a
deep
amber
too
almost
brown
color
the
head
is
massive
creamy
with
thick
glutinous
lace
that
clings
to
the
glass
nose
is
light
malt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
citrus
start
is
malt
lightly
sweet
the
top
flimsy
and
the
finish
pleasantly
hopped
mildly
acidic
with
a
long
lasting
malt
dry
aftertaste
quite
drinkable
and
well
worth
a
sample
and
a
beer
i
sample
often
the
esb
has
a
bit
more
sting
than
fullers
london
pride
which
is
nice
but
it
covers
up
some
of
the
more
subtle
notes
of
the
london
pride
too
i
simply
love
this
beer
better
cask
conditioned
than
from
the
bottle
but
have
had
good
samples
on
cask
and
have
had
bad
ones
at
its
best
its
quite
resiny
bittersweet
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
quite
good
but
perhaps
a
touch
overated
this
beer
seemed
to
pour
a
little
flat
but
still
left
a
bit
of
head
outstanding
amber
color
excellent
full
well
bablanced
flavor
for
a
person
who
is
not
big
on
english
style
beers
i
was
quite
impressed
with
the
taste
of
this
one
for
a
company
whose
botle
mentions
that
fullers
esb
is
the
worlds
original
esb
they
certainly
have
it
done
right
pours
to
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
seemed
to
disappear
rather
quickly
i
noticed
that
biscuitymalty
aroma
that
others
described
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
between
a
mild
hop
flavor
and
some
caramel
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
little
carbonation
its
easily
drinkable
and
i
dont
know
who
could
resist
a
second
offering
of
this
this
is
a
classic
esb
pours
with
an
offwhite
head
clear
golden
liquid
with
highlights
of
red
nose
is
of
very
biscuity
malt
clean
too
taste
is
a
bit
of
butterscotch
diacetyl
with
great
hoppy
dryness
taking
it
all
the
way
to
the
finish
which
is
pleasantly
bitter
and
long
this
original
e
s
b
still
stands
above
all
others
i
m
o
served
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
tiny
creamy
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
great
smooth
biscuity
malt
aroma
but
not
much
else
leaving
the
aroma
with
a
little
to
be
desired
the
biscuity
malt
opens
up
the
brew
and
carries
it
most
of
the
way
as
their
is
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
that
holds
up
the
brew
well
very
smooth
but
slightly
overcarbonated
none
the
less
this
is
one
awesomely
drinkable
brew
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
try
on
cask
clear
amber
with
thin
short
lasting
offwhite
head
smell
was
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
with
delicate
malt
undertones
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
which
became
less
bitter
as
it
warmed
more
balanced
there
was
a
nice
degree
of
carbonation
and
longlasting
flavor
good
drinkability
as
i
could
drink
a
couple
per
night
a
rich
and
tasty
esb
medium
amber
with
thick
lace
and
head
aroma
balanced
between
sweet
carmel
and
floral
hops
taste
is
rich
and
complex
with
a
sweet
carmel
malt
sweetness
almost
a
trace
of
what
to
me
tastes
like
a
tootsie
roll
strong
hop
presence
backs
up
with
full
floral
bite
very
drinkable
and
a
my
session
brew
for
the
other
day
this
beer
poured
a
nice
copper
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
bubbley
off
white
head
that
left
some
lace
it
had
an
aroma
of
hops
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
a
taste
of
hops
malt
caramel
lighter
than
some
of
the
other
esbs
i
have
tried
a
slightly
bittersweet
aftertaste
to
it
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
others
which
i
prefer
another
picnic
choice
22
oz
bottle
had
to
be
the
best
i
had
today
amberishred
making
up
words
here
dry
and
hoppy
from
start
to
finish
and
to
me
the
perfect
refreshing
and
still
dry
taste
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
expected
but
for
todays
outing
it
was
perfect
moving
right
up
to
the
top
of
the
list
for
a
summer
quaff
there
was
definitely
no
metallic
taste
that
some
others
have
mentioned
on
first
taste
you
get
a
hint
of
malt
followed
by
lively
mouth
and
bitter
smooth
finish
the
aftertaste
is
mellowed
by
a
smooth
coated
tongue
with
hints
of
fruit
this
is
the
standard
english
bitter
its
copper
with
a
trace
of
red
and
a
healthy
head
the
smell
is
caramel
with
a
little
spice
and
a
nice
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
with
a
strong
malt
flavor
notes
of
caramel
and
fruit
and
a
healthy
hop
kick
fullers
is
surprisingly
easy
going
down
this
is
a
fine
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
firm
foamy
head
that
dies
pretty
quicklyleaves
a
nice
ring
of
lace
on
the
nose
is
hops
and
slight
caramel
aroma
mouth
feel
is
fairly
smooth
but
a
bit
tingly
on
the
palate
slightly
sweet
bitterness
some
fruitiness
earthy
graininess
and
caramel
and
roasted
malt
in
the
background
very
enjoyable
brew
i
like
it
a
lotvery
flavorful
the
worlds
original
extra
special
bitter
perhaps
but
theres
better
interpretations
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
still
the
quintessential
esb
and
a
beer
everyone
should
try
at
the
very
least
for
the
sturdy
impressive
bottle
clear
darker
amber
approaching
ruby
head
is
bigbubbled
and
about
14
of
an
inch
after
a
minute
slightly
spicy
aroma
a
little
nutmeg
nice
medium
mouthfeel
and
restrained
carbonation
flavors
are
pretty
complex
and
range
from
allspice
through
traces
of
chocolate
nice
floral
bittering
really
nice
but
not
overblown
esb
may
be
my
favorite
fine
brew
as
if
fullers
would
do
anything
else
balance
is
great
very
subtle
compared
to
many
american
renditions
another
sentimental
favorite
one
of
the
first
good
beers
i
stumbled
accross
very
appealing
copper
color
i
thought
the
head
left
too
quickly
smell
was
nice
and
bitter
big
hops
just
a
very
hop
full
bitter
as
expected
read
the
label
easy
to
drink
several
at
a
time
and
goes
with
chicken
very
well
i
think
the
six
pack
bottles
are
little
overpriced
about
910
here
there
is
usually
something
different
to
try
for
a
better
price
but
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
but
unfortunately
it
depends
on
when
you
have
it
i
have
had
it
on
tap
and
it
was
superb
and
then
when
i
went
back
it
tasted
and
smelled
of
metal
i
have
a
feeling
it
depends
on
the
water
used
if
you
get
it
when
its
good
youre
in
for
a
good
beer
not
too
hoppy
good
balance
very
well
balanced
malthop
tones
mouthfeel
was
excellent
thin
head
dissipated
quickly
pleasant
copper
color
this
is
a
good
beer
but
rather
pricey
at
10
a
six
pack
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
i
dont
know
if
this
is
the
average
price
for
this
brew
or
not
this
beers
a
clear
copper
with
a
very
slight
head
carbonation
is
evident
as
a
small
quantity
of
bubbles
surface
a
small
herbal
aroma
mixed
with
a
slight
perfume
smell
you
can
tell
this
is
an
english
brew
theres
quite
the
stinging
hop
presence
almost
annoying
but
not
quite
some
decent
malt
tones
but
nothing
stands
out
to
me
with
this
one
its
not
extra
special
in
my
opinion
it
may
be
the
original
esb
but
certainly
is
not
the
best
esb
as
rogues
brutal
bitter
and
alesmiths
anvil
esb
are
much
better
really
an
attractive
looking
beer
with
nice
clear
redgoldbrown
color
and
good
full
head
aroma
is
rather
light
overall
and
largely
malt
without
much
hint
of
hops
full
malt
flavor
but
hops
stronger
than
i
expected
and
maybe
a
little
out
of
balance
for
my
tastes
i
do
like
the
dry
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
perceptible
can
note
the
alcohol
in
warming
and
a
bit
in
taste
too
id
like
to
try
this
again
especially
on
tap
if
i
can
find
it
fullers
esb
had
a
great
week
found
and
enjoyed
several
fullers
beer
esb
in
imperial
pint
brown
bottle
big
malt
and
big
hop
tastes
strong
aromas
rich
huge
body
bit
of
bitter
hops
bite
at
the
end
fullers
brews
very
very
good
beers
very
highly
recommended
first
beer
that
ive
ever
had
that
i
could
see
someone
describing
it
as
having
a
chewy
maltiness
definite
malt
presence
but
you
dont
really
notice
that
until
after
a
few
sips
as
the
bitterness
hits
you
first
and
as
you
get
used
to
it
the
malt
starts
rearing
its
lovely
head
very
nicely
balanced
despite
the
bitterness
its
interesting
to
see
what
the
different
hops
do
in
beers
the
hops
in
this
beer
offer
little
to
the
flavor
of
the
beer
except
bitterness
while
in
victorys
hopdevil
they
give
it
a
very
floralperfumey
smell
and
taste
and
in
most
apas
they
lend
a
grapefruity
taste
man
do
i
ever
like
this
stuff
nice
clear
amber
color
with
an
ample
head
smells
great
with
its
malty
carmel
aroma
when
i
tasted
it
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
was
carmel
apples
very
well
balanced
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
than
carries
into
the
aftertaste
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
the
entire
line
of
fullers
beers
are
incredible
especially
the
esb
this
beer
has
wonderful
balance
between
the
aroma
to
the
final
taste
for
me
all
other
esb
beers
fail
to
measure
up
to
the
fullers
appealing
both
visually
and
olfactorily
is
that
a
word
with
a
pleasing
earthy
scent
superb
mouthfeel
and
wonderful
firm
malt
flavor
that
is
hearty
and
rousing
finish
is
perfectly
balanced
with
a
rounded
bready
dryness
kent
goldings
does
not
linger
long
on
the
palate
the
metallic
undertaste
does
get
to
me
though
and
it
is
the
one
stumbling
block
of
this
beer
some
may
not
mind
it
i
do
perhaps
it
is
a
symptom
of
adjuncts
at
any
rate
this
is
otherwise
a
splendid
beer
each
sip
is
a
slightly
different
experience
and
that
is
always
the
sign
of
a
very
good
beer
the
head
dissapates
quickly
into
a
thin
layer
that
leaves
a
sparse
web
down
the
glass
perfectly
bronze
in
color
exhibiting
excellent
clarity
lots
of
fruity
and
bready
esters
hit
the
nose
at
first
but
are
then
followed
by
a
earthy
fuggles
hop
nose
as
the
beer
warms
an
almost
licorice
note
can
be
perceived
the
moderate
carbonation
seems
to
lighten
the
body
at
first
but
as
co2
escapes
the
body
seems
to
increase
the
hop
bitterness
is
quite
mild
and
clean
serving
to
balance
the
very
pleasant
maltiness
hop
flavor
is
signature
british
and
is
characterized
by
rustic
earthy
leafy
and
slightly
floral
components
quite
complex
toasted
malt
flavors
round
out
the
finish
this
very
well
crafted
and
highly
drinkable
esb
is
another
quality
fullers
beer
ill
place
this
just
a
notch
below
youngs
sla
and
london
pride
since
its
more
subdued
in
yeast
fruity
esters
something
i
love
in
a
bitter
or
english
pale
a
very
complex
beer
this
is
not
just
a
bitter
but
a
flavorful
bitter
the
flavor
hops
were
a
bit
flowery
like
saaz
i
believe
but
i
know
that
fullers
does
not
use
saaz
this
has
a
great
lingering
finish
the
malt
and
hop
balance
is
superb
this
is
one
that
grows
on
you
my
first
drink
i
thought
pretty
good
beer
my
second
pretty
damn
good
beer
a
friend
introduced
me
to
this
beer
and
now
i
buy
it
now
i
love
it
very
smooth
makes
you
want
to
roll
it
around
before
you
send
it
down
the
hatch
it
has
a
nice
head
that
leaves
traces
of
it
down
the
side
of
the
glass
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
it
has
a
brilliant
medium
amber
color
and
clarity
the
taste
is
almost
buttery
and
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
by
far
the
best
ive
had
from
any
beer
period
this
is
the
beer
i
claim
as
my
fallback
beer
and
i
mean
that
with
the
greatest
of
compliments
one
of
the
most
satisfying
beers
i
have
ever
had
great
rich
colorgreat
malty
taste
with
good
hop
ending
maybe
the
standard
for
an
english
esb
with
its
fruity
maltiness
and
subtle
hops
in
the
finish
a
mellow
sessionable
beer
that
i
need
to
try
on
cask
an
outstanding
beer
the
deep
amber
color
defines
what
a
bitter
is
supposed
to
look
like
slightly
tangy
almost
metallic
smell
the
initial
taste
is
also
a
bit
tangy
and
metallic
then
gives
way
to
a
bready
slightly
sweet
finish
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
lingers
i
love
it
there
is
no
other
esb
in
my
opinion
probably
my
favorate
beer
period
my
drinking
buddys
fridge
was
perpetually
filled
with
bud
only
a
few
months
ago
and
now
he
swears
by
this
stuff
a
truly
great
beer
appeals
to
the
gourmet
and
novice
alike
so
well
balanced
i
want
to
shout
with
joy
i
like
this
beer
taste
many
of
the
aromas
make
a
flawless
transition
onto
the
palate
you
ever
had
that
experience
sure
you
have
there
isnt
an
off
balanced
feature
in
this
brew
including
the
hopmalt
balance
if
there
was
a
perfect
marriage
between
these
contrasts
fullers

succeded

a
superb
beer
overall
the

all
esbs

i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
i
have
never
had
a
brew
with
a
better
malt
to
hop
balance
neither
overpowers
the
other
and
both
compliment
each
other
quite
nicely
a
nice
amber
color
in
the
glass
with
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
this
beer
is
just
plain
flavorful
without
any
residual
bitterness

is
beginning
to
be
a

the
definitive

sorry
but
this
is
an
english
style
and
i
have
never
found
an
american
version
that
comes
anywhere
close
it
does
need
to
be
fresh
though
a
rush
of
distinctive
flavors
malty
nutty

with
a
good
hop
bite
extraordinarily
wellbalanced
london
pride
on
steroids
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
a
very
nice
bitter
with
a
finish
that
is
both
sharp
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
of
the
style
it
was
flavorful
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
d
at
5
this
is
a
quaffable
ale
the
hop
profile
will
keep
the
hophead
happy
while
the

pleases
the
sessioners
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
bready
and

slightly

not

this
brew
is
light

and
crisp
on
the

many
floral
notes
accompany
rich
caramelized
breads
very
refreshing
to
have
on
a
spring
afternoon
d
this
beer
was
really
really
good
esbs
are
interesting
to
me
in
either
they
are
good
or
else
they
terrible
abv
on
this
makes
it
a
easy
drinker
for
the
night
which
i
had
no
problem
drinking
a
couple
pints
of
this
this
is
a
classic
great
lakes
beer
moondog
is
king
i
still
havent
come
across
a
tastier
and
more
enjoyable
esb
highly
recommended
drinkability
isnt
even
debatable
goes
down
so
easy
and
makes
me
want
more
read
the
description
of
an
esb
give
this
a
try
and
im
sure
you
will
find
this
beer
better
than
average
and
expected
drinkability
was
about
perfect
the
on
distraction
may
be
that
its
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
for
my
tastes
for
the
style
but
is
a
wonderful
session
type
brew
and
its
sad
that
this
has
been
taken
out
of
the
rotating
bottle
releases
on
tap
of
the
brewpub
tons
of
offwhite

beer
with

english
hops
and
bready

a
very
nice

to
it

this
an
awesome
beer
to
drink
on

i
wish
i
had
another

with
great
lacing
and
a
small

about
one
finger
a
clean
flowery
hop
aroma
is
heavy
in
the
nose
tastes
of
munich
and
crystal
malts
semi
sweet
with
a
slightly
citrus
hop
kick
and
a
thin
body
overall
very
drinkable
but
very
underwhelming
after
hearing
so
many
good
things
about
this
brew
notes
interesting
to
have
on
tap
at
the
brewery
others
have
lamented
the
brewerys
decision
to
discontinue
bottling
of
this
beer
i
can
see
why
it
is
very
drinkable
and
delicious
drinkability
downright
quaffable
a
pleasant
refreshing
ale
i
could
drink
all
damn
day
im
reviewing
and
grading
based
on
what
i
experience
while
id
like
more
to
this
beer
the
taste
and
drinkability
are
both
good
like
all
great
lakes
beers
its
very
well
done
this
one
happens
to
be
on
the
bottom
end
of
my
style
preference
drinkability
much
lighter
in
color
than
i
would
expect
from
an
esb
but
is
does
deliver
in
flavor
if
this
were
a
little
darker
and
a
little
less
carbonated
it
would
be
spot
on
as
it
is
it
is
still
pretty
good
d
goes
down
easy
notes
wow
i
really
enjoyed
this
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
esb
its
nowhere
near
a
fullers
but
it
still
makes
me
feel
extra
special
drinkability
is
huge
i
could
down
a
6
of
this
over
the
course
of
a
vacation
day
and
only
feel
a
little
guilty
very
moreish
this
ale
pours
a
clear
golden
with
thick
clingy
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
hoppy
with
mediumlow
sweetness
the
flavor
is
moderately
hoppy
but
balanced
by
a
moderate
biscuity
malt
flavor
the
swallow
is
smooth
and
fruity
esters
emerge
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
with
a
mediumthin
body
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
with
extraordinary
drinkability
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
stuff
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
ill
drink
if
i
see
again
d
a
very
nice
play
on
the
style
definitely
a
perfect
summer
beer
for
those
hot
and
muggy
days
i
strongly
reccommend
trying
this
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
good
carbonation
and
hop
resins
slightly
sweet
and
super
easy
to
drink
amazing
wish
we
had
easier
access
to
it
over
here
i
would
buy
it
more
often
d
at
5
this
is
a
quaffable
ale
the
hop
profile
will
keep
the
hophead
happy
while
the
low
alcohol
pleases
the
sessioners
d
highly
drinkable
i
really
loved
this
a
very
drinkable
esb
in
fact
when
on
tap
moondog
is
probably
my
favorite
esb
d
first
go
with
an
esb
and
it
was
nice
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
other
beers
ive
had
not
a
bad
beer
for
8
50
a
six
just
not
all
that
memorable
overall
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
great
lakes
i
think
i
would
take
burning
river
any
day
over
this
brew
this
to
me
is
a
solid
version
of
a
uniquely
american
session
ale
easy
to
drink
yet
has
serviceable
complexity
and
hop
presence
d
notes
this
is
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
take
on
a
british
esb
moondogs
a
very
solid
esb
im
not
traditionally
a
huge
fan
of
esbs
but
this
is
a
good
one
frankly
its
pretty
impressive
save
for
the
nose
its
just
too
weak
to
really
impress
in
that
department
otherwise
very
solid
beer
pours
gold
in
color
with
a
white
ring
around
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
subtle
hops
and
nothing
else
very
bitter
in
the
taste
lots
of
bittering
hops
in
this
beer
bubbly
almost
a
heavy
carbonated
feel
due
to
the
hops
its
that
bitter
not
a
whole
lotta
flavor
just
a
very
bitter
beer
easy
drinking
very
good
web
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
after
a
few
sips
this
is
a
highly
hopped
beer
it
really
is
noticeable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
later
into
a
pils
glass
the
pils
is
the
way
to
go
dark
bronze
color
with
a
thin
white
head
tons
of
sticky
lacing
and
bountiful
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
favored
by
a
sharp
hop
scent
backed
by
some
subtle
malts
nice
scent
but
it
should
be
more
abundant
mouthfeel
is
also
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
ample
fullness
the
flavor
is
real
nice
generous
amounts
of
flowery
hops
are
present
the
malts
are
subtle
and
there
are
tiny
overtones
of
citrus
hop
flavors
somewhat
similar
to
their
dortmunder
gold
this
is
an
enjoyable
ale
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
eric
drinkability
is
outstanding
its
probably
the
first
beer
ive
ever
had
that
i
wished
i
had
gotten
a
case
of
instead
of
a
single
now
ive
got
to
go
buy
more
of
it
before
they
pull
it
off
the
shelves
due
to
the
season
changing
golden
amber
body
with
creamy
white
head
that
falls
somewhat
quickly
leaving
random
spots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
nice
fresh
nose
with
floral
perfume
and
light
citrus
notes
a
biscuity
essence
and
hints
of
caramel
are
underneath
taste
is
nice
and
well
balanced
moderate
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
the
malts
which
keep
it
in
check
it
ends
with
a
slightly
drying
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
good
carbonation
to
it
and
slides
down
quite
easy
overall
this
is
quite
the
session
brew
i
would
love
to
have
this
available
at
all
times
quality
esb
light
mouthfeelpepperywith
a
mouthwatering
drying
finish
making
for
an
exceptional
drinker
not
a
huge
esb
fanthis
esb
makes
my
feel
different
about
that
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
next
yearas
soon
as
it
comes
out
mf
creamy
goodness
nice
mouth
coating
appropriately
carbonated
d
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
should
stop
you
from
putting
a
few
of
these
away
overall
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
the
bangforthebuck
beer
and
is
my
daily
beer
in
the
early
summer
months
it
would
be
year
round
if
only
they
made
it
however
after
many
sixes
of
this
its
getting
old
for
me
very
much
a
session
beer
for
a
short
while
every
season
it
becomes
my
favorite
then
fades
maybe
thats
why
its
limited
release
wish
i
could
have
this
on
cask
would
be
outstanding
overal
experience
is
like
every
other
glbc
product
ive
had
excellent
a
wellcrafted
session
esb
cant
wait
to
try
this
with
food
t
dry
biscuit
like
background
with
a
strong
grassy
floral
hop
bite
much
drier
and
hoppy
than
malty
and
sweet
relatively
light
body
with
active
carbonation
and
very
strong
lingering
malty
biscuit
flavor
very
drinkable
a
nice
esb
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
and
probably
my
least
favorite
glbc
bottled
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
overall
a
pretty
good
session
esb
from
great
lakes
im
thinking
that
this
is
the
same
as
their
moondog
ale
just
renamed
twelve
ounce
bottle
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
patchy
lace
aroma
is
toasted
malt
peppery
hops
and
a
hint
of
florals
light
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
taste
has
some
caramel
sweetness
toasted
bread
peppery
hops
and
some
fruity
pear
bitterness
is
tame
but
assertive
very
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
better
american
stabs
at
an
esb
the
mouth
is
tart
and
slightly
thick
could
be
a
session
beer
if
you
wanted
to
go
very
easy
moondog
pours
a
bright
yelloworange
color
with
lots
of
visible
active
sodalike
carbonation
and
a
big
2
finger
dense
white
head
stale
hops
corn
and
pale
malts
make
up
the
nose
very
punchy
and
bright
tasting
the
hops
are
in
great
balance
with
the
malts
and
it
is
not
that
bitter
faint
hints
of
fruit
and
bread
it
leaves
a
slight
sweetness
on
the
tongue
its
very
seltzerlike
in
body
and
mouth
feel
very
refreshing
zingy
beer
d
tasty
and
clean
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
with
on
a
hot
day
a
nice
treat
certainly
one
of
the
more
refreshing
beers
i
have
had
this
year
good
for
the
summer
another
quality
great
lakes
brew
i
could
drink
this
esb
all
day
overall
i
would
have
to
say
meh
maybe
it
would
shine
on
cask
maybe
d
i
really
like
this
beer
its
just
another
good
beer
from
the
guys
at
great
lakes
nice
beer
but
not
a
typical
esb
flavor
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
a
warmweather
ale
which
goes
easy
but
is
not
particularly
interesting
i
may
purchase
this
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
otherwise
its
one
of
the
lesser
productions
from
the
great
lakes
camp
excellent
esb
i
love
great
lakes
beers
and
it
was
awesome
to
try
them
on
tap
d
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
its
exactly
what
i
expect
from
an
esb
with
the
right
balance
and
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
but
nevertheless
a
great
very
balanced
drinkable
beer
i
could
and
did
drink
these
all
night
i
have
yet
to
try
anything
from
great
lakes
i
havent
liked
and
here
the
streak
continues
highly
recommended
classic
great
lakes
excellence
at
work
in
a
very
fine
and
unique
esb
will
kick
back
and
probably
overeagerly
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
sixer
na
zdravje
good
feel
to
this
beer
i
will
drink
it
again
poured
a
gold
color
with
a
generous
amount
of

that
fizzles
and
leaves
some
lacing
around
aroma
is
very
crisp
with
some
light
grain
build
plenty
of
lacing
for
this
taste
is
very
hop
filled
with
a
grassyfloral
back
drop
mouth
feel
is
very
clean
and
crisp
i
think
i
have
found
a
new
fave
session
beer
might
have
to
pickup
some
more
of
this
one
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
this
is
a
great
session
or
lawn
mower
beer
goes
great
with
the
ohio
spring
weather
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
session
beers
that
great
lakes
brews
like
most
of
glbc
brews
this
is
beer
is
very
appealing
to
the
eye
poors
a
nice
golden
color
with
many
bubbles
the
smell
does
seems
a
bit
off
almost
grassy
not
to
bad
though
the
taste
exemplifies
a
solid
a
esb
great
brew
glbc
pours
a
clear
light
copper
hue
with
a
big
bubbled
one
finger
head
that
remains
for
a
quite
sometime
stickiness
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
but
its
there
a
whole
bunch
of
bubbles
race
to
the
top
of
the
glass
as
well
smell
is
very
glbcesque
peanut
butter
in
the
nose
yes
peanut
butter
just
like
the
burning
river
pale
mild
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
sweet
citrus
malts
tingle
the
nose
as
well
very
subtle
overall
aroma
with
this
one
nicey
flavor
begins
with
a
sweet
nutty
taste
followed
by
a
bit
of
grapefruit
and
pine
caramel
malts
midway
through
leading
to
a
lemongrass
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
spice
light
to
medium
body
with
a
sharp
feel
carbonation
is
a
bit
strong
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
overall
quality
of
this
brew
another
solid
drinkable
beer
from
glbc
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
their
beers
are
available
in
ny
lets
hope
its
sooner
rather
than
later
poured
a
clear
amber
with
1
inch
of
frothy
offwhite
head
good
retention
some
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
a
bit
of
malty
biscuit
and
honey
not
a
lot
of
aroma
though
had
to
dig
deep
tastes
of
honey
toasted
grain
and
floral
hops
medium
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
not
too
bitter
and
has
a
crisp
finish
but
all
the
flavors
seem
a
little
muted
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
but
needs
a
little
more
oomph
in
the
flavor
department
mf
d
at
first
effervescent
and
thin
bodied
but
as
the
fizz
quickly
fades
on
the
tongue
a
slight
thickness
is
revealed
as
this
suddenly
medium
bodied
ale
coats
the
palate
with
a
drying
hop
film
the
pros
and
cons
for
me
here
are
kinda
tough
to
distinguish
since
theyre
not
really
good
or
bad
from
2007
memories
i
remember
a
slightly
thicker
body
that
was
not
quite
syrupy
but
i
could
possibly
be
getting
that
mixed
in
with
memories
of
the
feel
of
the
several
other
traditional
esbs
ive
had
and
a
slightly
thicker
less
carbonated
brew
is
somewhat
desired
on
the
flipside
this
relatively
highly
carbonated
beer
keeps
my
attention
and
is
much
more
crisp
and
quenching
than
those
from
the
past
maybe
this
batch
is
a
little
different
or
maybe
im
just
a
scatterbrain
great
lakes
is
pretty
much
my
favorite
brewery
and
theyve
never
presented
me
with
a
drink
not
to
my
liking
with
the
exception
of
christmas
ale
due
to
my
personal
preferences
but
in
the
end
2008
moondog
still
feels
like
pale
ale
to
me
its
d
is
incredible
however
and
what
it
may
lack
in
style
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
enjoyment
an
extremely
sessionable
brew
and
one
i
will
certainly
seek
out
as
the
months
grow
warmer
just
another
solid
offering
from
the
people
at

is
good

it

easy
and
with
a

abv
its
a
good
choice
as
a
session
beer
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
its
nice
and
refreshing
id
definitely
pick
up
some
of
this
again
d
very
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
for
summer
sessions
and
converting
true
to
some
lighter
bristish
versions
with
an
american
twist
very
floral
finish
drinkability
this
is
very
good
goes
down
well
and
is
very
sessionable
i
dont
necessarily
want
lots
of
these
but
its
pretty
refreshing
and
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hop
recommended
not
bad

enjoyable
easy
drinking

not
a
extra
strong

up

mostly
malt
with
some
spicy

in
the

worth
a
try
crisp
tangy
and
dry
medium

i
would
go
for
this
one
again
and
as
a
session
brew
with
the
5
not
overpowering
by
any
means
drinkability
i
found
myself
drinking
this
pretty
quickly
and
sans
the
carbonation
this
beer
is
lacking
any
flaws
the
malt
profile
in
this
beer
is
excellent
easy
drinking
balanced
session
brew
great
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
mild
but
flavorful
worth
the
wait
for
me
indeed
slàinte
light
amber
with
an
absolutely
massive
offwhite
head
primarily
fruity
nose
with
scents
of
fresh
melon
strawberries
apples
caramel
and
brown
sugar
malts
and
a
distinctly
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
although
the
carmelly
malts
and
floral
hops
are
more
prominent
many
fruits
abound
as
well
light
body
and
lively
but
not
overbearing
carbonation
great
authentic
rendition
of
a
classic
style
i
bet
this
stuff
is
superb
on
cask
if
it
ever
is
presented
that
way
notes
very
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
not
my
favorite
but
still
nothing
i
would
be
embaressed
to
serve
to
my
beer
loving
friends
drinkability
goes
down
fairly
easily
average
alcohol
content
and
light
body
makes
it
a
decent
session
beer
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
big
hops
with
noble
and
american
qualities
but
the
great
malt
flavors
are
lost
to
quickly
in
the
hops
final
thought
a
subtle
flavored
esb
that
has
session
written
all
over
it
a
great
brew
by
great
lakes
medium
bodied
and
light
and
delicate
carbonation
give
this
beer
a
great
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
is
a
great
canidate
to
be
a
session
beer
this
is
one
that
i
will
definitely
comeback
to
in
the
future
perhaps
in
a
few
weeks
or
next
year
when
the
next
batch
comes
out
either
way
i
can
see
myself
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future
its
a
great
beer
to
enojy
on
warm
springsummer
nights
last
swigs
where
this
is
not
a
plae
ale
is
quite
a
trick
just
enough
bready
malt
to
keep
it
in
check
a
decent
american
example
of
an
english
classic
exceptionally
clean
refreshing
mouthfeel
big
invigorating
carbonation
with
a
perfect
blend
of
malt
and
hop
some
lemon
rind
orange
and
flowers
round
out
the
taste
i
cant
say
enough
about
how
wonderful
this
beer
is
to
drink
all
day
bottom
line
another
success
from
great
lakes
i
suppose
that
someday
ill
run
across
something
of
theirs
i
dont
like
but
not
today
apparently
its
a
spring
release
so
get
it
now
while
you
can
highly
recommended
its
a
good
esb
the
malt
is
nice
and
hops
let
it
stand
out
great
aroma
like
many
bitters
you
could
drink
these
forever
and
a
day
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
true
esb
its
almost
like
a
vienna
lager
but
nonetheless
it
is
very
good
very
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
slight
hoppiness
caramel
leads
the
malts
initially
followed
by
extreme
smoothness
and
a
nice
refreshing
finish
i
must
say
ive
been
in
the
cleveland
area
2
months
have
tried
about
6
styles
of
glbc
and
havent
been
disappointed
in
one
this
is
a
nice
looking
dark
gold
beer
with
an
almost
white
head
the
smell
is
subtle
but
good
it
has
an
almost
german
lager
type
malty
smell
mixed
with
the
aroma
of
english
hops
at
first
there
is
very
little
taste
then
there
is
a
slightly
dry
hoppy
taste
that
gets
a
bit
more
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
never
truely
bitter
in
the
pale
ale
sense
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
drinkability
is
very
good
quite
pleasant
albeit
ordinary
very
pilsner
like
with
other
attributes
golden
yellow
color
with
very
nice
head
retention
flowery
and
lightly
spicy
aroma
with
an
underlying
sweetness
and
hop
character
tastes
moderately
malty
bready
and
a
little
grainy
with
a
honeysuckle
like
sweetness
a
light
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
substantiate
this
brew
becomming
a
very
balanced
pleasant
brew
finishes
very
clean
and
crisp
despite
the
light
powdery
sweetness
very
smooth
crisp
finish
leaves
as
good
as
it
starts
ill
definitely
have
this
again
score
another
for
the
glbc
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
enjoyed
in
this
style
very
drinkable
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
foamy
layer
on
the
top
the
nose
is
of
fruits
and
has
a
slightly
sweet
malty
presence
it
tastes
good
strong
of
fruits
and
hops
maybe
a
little
malty
in
the

the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
shy
of

and
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
feels
just
right
drinkability
is
good
i
wish
i
had
several
of
these
to
enjoy
tonight
good
beer
here
id
have
a
hard
time
finding
anything
wrong
with
this
one
cheers
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
has
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
an
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
hops
and
a
little
fruit
toasted
malt
flavor
a
little
buttery
hops
come
in
midway
and
provide
a
solid
flavor
and
bitterness
fruit
flavor
comes
in
the
finish
not
overly
bitter
drinkability
is
good
this
is
yet
another
solid
offering
from
glbc
drinkability
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
would
also
make
a
good
choice
for
a
esb
session
drink
if
you
can
find
it
drinkability
moondog
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
is
only
mildly
bitter
its
aroma
also
gets
noticeably
worse
as
it
warms
still
its
pretty
good
and
you
could
session
several
of
these
easily
very
nice
crossstyle
a
yeasty
delight
with
a
supporting
bitterness
and
well
malted
initially
large
head
that
evaporated
to
a
crown
of
yeast
nice
yeast
aroma
and
creaminess
easy
satisfying
drink
at
the
end
of
another
hot
summer
day
malted
milk
aftertaste
second
botle
on
incredible
hot
day
a
year
later
and
agree
with
everything
very
drying
aftertaste
moderate
tingly
mouthfeel
another
great
session
brew
from
glbc
drinkability
a
good
session
beer
and
another
solid
brew
from
my
for
the
moment
great
lakes
brewing
company
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
they
dont
talk
down
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
goes
down
smooth
i
could
drink
this
brew
all
night
a
nice
deep
mix
of
flavors
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
yet
another
winner
from
great
lakes
drinkability
im
not
blown
away
by
this
one
but
it
could
be
a
good
session
beer
as
it
is
easy
going
down
dn
i
feel
a
fool
for
thinking
this
would
be
too
bitter
not
had
too
many
esbs
yet
i
was
expecting
a
lemon
i
got
a
surprisingly
delicate
beer
with
great
balance
aromas
could
be
kicked
up
a
notch
or
two
but
otherwise
this
is
another
highly
drinkable
beer
from
a
rock
solid
brewery
man
i
love
glbc
stuff
drinkability
is
good
easy
drinking
style
good
flavors
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
esb
least
memorable
beer
of
all
the
ones
i
tried
for
some
reason
does
have
a
kick
on
the
tongue
and
loos
nice
but
everything
else
was
just
above
average
relatively
speaking
my
least
favorite
great
lakes
brew
but
this
is
coming
from
a
great
brewery
my
5
ounce
taster
was
enough
for
me
the
beer
slides
uphill
initially
mild
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
then
slowly
peaks
to
a
nice
rich
crescendo
and
finish
on
the
throat
there
are
not
a
lot
of
peaks
and
valleys
but
still
an
enjoyable
ride
and
a
nice
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
this
brew
has
a
hazy
oragne
body
topped
by
a
big
bubbly
white
head
excellent
bitter
hop
aroma
boing
sweet
malt
front
coupled
by
a
nice

i
wish
this
beer
was
here
in
mich
sooner
i
would
like
to
have
had
this
for
the
summer
to
have
on
those
hot
days
and
when
bbqing
a
very
drinkable
beer
moondog
ale
may
not
be
a
worldclass
version
but
its
next
to
impossible
for
a
brewery
to
nail
each
and
every
style
they
choose
to
brew
it
is
however
a
rock
solid
tasty
as
hell
esb
that
maintains
great
lakess
place
as
a
shining
star
in

thanks

in

for
bringing
me
a
sixer
on
your
most
recent
trip
west
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
short
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
citruslike
very
pleasant
the
orange
character
is
quite
noticeable
in
the
flavor
dry
finish
nice
body
on
this
one
interesting
brew
and
good
to
drink
but
nothing
spectacular
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
half
an
inch
wow
the
nose
is
very
orange
and
fruity
the
flavor
is
good
there
is
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
in
there
and
a
subtle
hop
that
comes
through
on
the
finish
i
dont
think
this
is
an
esb
but
i
think
its
good
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
a
bit
creamy
i
do
like
it
drinkability
is
high
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
a
good
offering
this
has
some
very
good
hop
aroma
with
a
nice
balance
of
caramel
malt
peeking
through
for
those
interested
in
specific
styles
it
could
probably
passoff
as
an
apa
even
though
its
supposed
to
be
a
bitter
flavor
has
a
great
balance
of
bitterness
and
caramel
malt
the
noticeable
presence
of
northern
brewer
hops
makes
this
a
nice
example
of
northern
brewers
versatility
for
both
bitterness
and
flavor
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
smooth
balance
making
this
an
easy
brew
to
drink
this
is
another
quality
beer
from
great
lakes
this
is
a
good
session
beer
a
very
well
crafted
and
smooth
beverage
ng
mouth
is
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
beer
was
gone
before
i
even
realized
it
very
clean
and
refreshing
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
small
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
throughout
smells
like
bread
with
some
flowery
hops
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
bready
malt
followed
by
a
doughlike
center
the
finish
is
a
flowery
slightly
herbal
hop
flavor
with
a
modest
amount
of
bitterness
finish
is
pretty
dry
medium
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
what
a
session
beer
nothing
overwhelming
makes
this
perfect
to
drink
all
evening
another
quality
beer
from
glbc
this
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
nice
white
head
that
disappears
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
with
nice
white
carbonation
atolls
the
smell
is
kinda
flowery
and
caramel
sweet
the
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
is
very
subtle
very
relaxed
as
it
moves
across
the
pallet
the
floral
hoppiness
gives
way
to
some
slight
fruit
flavors
and
malty
sweetness
as
far
a
mouthfeel
is
concerned
the
carbonation
is
perfect
and
its
a
little
thin
as
it
rolls
around
my
mouth
the
mouthfeel
and
the
mildness
of
the
flavor
make
this
very
drinkable
easily
looking
for
more
to
enjoy
when
the
sixpack
is
empty
well
done
as
usual
by
great
lakes
brewing
company
very
nice
esb
the
sugar
cookie
finish
and
floral
hops
really
do
it
for
me
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
more
drinkable
with
a
little
less
bitterness
still
this
is
an
awesome
brew
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
dead
guy
ale
or
boston
ale
recommended
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
color
and
is
topped
by
a
dark
cream
colored
head
a
fairly
clean
aroma
that
has
a
faint
citrus
aroma
with
a
bit
of
grassiness
as
well
as
the
aroma
suggests
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
hop
flavor
here
but
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
hint
of
toasty
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
tastes
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
this
is
a
rather
plain
almost
boring
beer
i
had
reviewed
this
when
i
was
starting
my
journey
as
a
ba
and
recently
had
this
again
and
well
4
years
and
500
beers
later
makes
a
difference
i
was
only
comparing
this
with
twothree
esbs
and
fullers
and
the
broad
ripple
were
two
of
the
few
so
now
with
an
update
may
2008
ill
say
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
esb
but
still
does
not
match
the
best
i
think
i
just
found
my
light
beer
for
my
dream
tap
line
this
is
a
dandy
in
its
own
way
from
great
lakes
hey
cokes
thanks
for
setting
up
the
huge
dog
with
the
moon

drinkability
is
very
solid
and
very
refreshing
nice
summer
beer
not
sure
i
agree
on
the
esb
designation
but
very
nice
beer
12oz

is

left
on
this
one
the
smell
is
grassy
and
hoppy
with
a
little
sweet
malt
present
it
really
smells
more
like
an
amber
lager
than
an
ale
the
taste
starts
with
sweet
caramel
malt
little
bits
of
cherry
and
citrus
present
the
finish
has
a
good
little
dose
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
very
very
smooth
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
and
i
could
down
many
of

absolutely

organic

that

they
are
certainly
present
the

increases
on

does
not
really
pack
a
noteworthy
punch
in
the
end
this
is
a
light
and
drinkable
offering
that
is
good
but
clearly
lacks
the
attributes
of
the
best
versions
of
this
style
o
a
nice

if

are

your
choice
it
is
a
nice
beer
to

with
almost
any

i
would
definitely
get
this
beer
on

at
a
restaurant
but
would
not
buy
it
in
the
bottle
to
drink
at
home
as
a

this

its

there
are
others
in

style
that
i
would
choose
first
kinda
hurts
to
give
a
brewery
i
really
like
a
negative
review
i
think
for
some
the
word
organic
on
the
front
is
license
to
charge
a
bunch
for
an
underwhelming
product

overall
it
seems
to
be
that
i
liked
this
one
more
than
most
i
thought
it
was
good
regardless
of
whether
it
was
organic
or
not
i
cant
quite
tell
where
this
missed
but
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
stronger
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
giver
this
beer
some
teeth
i
downed
it
pretty
quick
but
i
prefer
to
savor
my
beer
as
i
search
for
the
distinctions
in
it
unfortunately
theres
not
much
memorable
to
this
even
if
organic
was
printed
on
the
bottle
a
disappointment
to
say
the
least
o
meh
its
fine
but
all
components
are
just
a
a
tad
shy
of
exceptional
o
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
esb
with
a
a
bit
of
fruitienss
and
a
nice
malt
flavor
a
little
cloudy
for
an
esb
it
lost
a
bit
on
appearance
o
this
was
an
absolute
disappointment
for
me
all
around
lacking
unfortunately
this
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
amber
color
with
a
thin
very
minimal
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
it
had
some
nice
caramel
like
aromas
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
other
grains
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
earty
semisweet
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
the
beer
was
drinkable
and
easy
going
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
not
my
favorite
esb
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
its
pretty
fucking
average
ive
had
worse
and
ive
had
better
than
this
one
o
the
underrated
and
humble
lakefront
scores
again
with
the
first
usda
certified
organic
beer
while
this
esb
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
classics
from
england
organic
esb
features
a
nice
tasty
malt
base
with
subtle
earthy
hop
overtones
and
a
refreshing
bitterness
along
the
finish
a
great
session
beer
to
put
pint
after
pint
back
while
chatting
up
the
blokes
at
the
bar
id
say
this
was
straightforward
and
pretty
good
needs
a
little
more
hops
but
drinks
nice
caramel
malts
and
a
sweet
grain
flavor
dominate
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
easy
drinking
and
balanced
but
seems
to
be
missing
something
o
this
is
hands
down
not
only
the
worst
esb
ive
ever
had
but
also
the
worst
organic
beer
of
any
type
ive
ever
had
i
dont
know
what
the
people
at
lakefront
were
thinking
maybe
they
werent
ive
never
been
so
happy
to
pour
a
bottle
down
the
drain
as
i
am
now
o
this
is
not
what
i
expected
in
an
esb
i
guess
im
just
not
in
to
organic
beer
o
a
little
light
to
be
an
esb
not
very
complex
in
flavor
or
smell
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
cool
with
all
organic
ingredients
nice
not
must
have
overall
i
dont
mind
this
beer
but
the
dominance
of
sweet
caramel
makes
it
a
bit
of
a
onetrick
pony
i
would
probably
not
want
to
drink
several
over
the
course
of
one
evening
while
i
am
happy
to
support
an
organic
beer
i
must
say
that
the
esb
moniker
sets
up
some
expectation
of
toasty
maltiness
and
hoppy
bitterness
and
aroma
that
just
dont
seem
strong
enough
to
me
in
this
example
it
is
much
more
like
a
caramelly
american
amber
or
even
an
irish
red
d
good
for
the
style
not
overly
hopped
well
balanced
and
sessionable
while
rather
easy
to
put
back
on
the
esb
scale
this
offering
is
quite
lacking
not
crisp
not
really
bitter
not
biscuity
ergo
not
a
proper
esb
drink
this
while
not
thinking
too
hard
nothing
special
going
on
here
it
went
down
without
any
problems
but
i
dont
think
id
bother
buying
it
again
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
the
nose
is
mostly
malt
with
a
small
hop
note
the
beer
is
decent
but
there
is
a
lack
of
complexity
with
the
hops
that
makes
an
esb
interesting
drinkable
for
sure
and
no
real
faults
but
it
gets
a
little
boring
over
time
unlike
most
reviewers
i
thought
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
favors
well
when
compared
to
fullers
e
s
b
id
seek
this
out
again
if
i
wanted
a
smooth
highly
drinkable
ale
ambercolored
liquid
topped
by
a
shortlived
cap
of
foam
smell
is
lightly
malty
at
best
taste
similarly
is
malt
forward
biscuits
but
mostly
nondescript
not
particularly
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
floral
hop
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
overall
its
not
at
all
bad
but
really
doesnt
distinguish
itself
in
any
way
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
it
lacks
in
depth
beef
this
one
up
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
and
this
could
be
really
really
good
from
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
caramel
cider
like
color
smells
of
yeast
and
sweet
apples
excessively
carbonated
and
taste
strongly
of
apple
cider
with
lemony
notes
the
theme
here
being
apple
cider
cloyingly
sweet
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
intended
to
be
an
esb
o
not
bad
but
not
doing
anything
to
wow
me
o
overall
a
moderately
pleasing
esb
the
organic
label
does
little
for
me
in
terms
of
taste
as
your
not
gonna
really
taste
the
naturalness
of
the
organic
wheat
now
are
you
its
the
sugars
thats
being
converted
but
works
if
you
an
ecofriendly
craft
drinker
owell
it
starts
off
tasty
but
quickly
the
quality
seems
to
deteriorate
in
fact
towards
the
end
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
this
is
just
a
bad
esb
body
is
thin
average
carbonation
and
it
lacks
depth
not
really
bitter
or
hoppy
not
malty
either
seems
to
lack
ingredients
altogether
m
mediumlight
bodied
with
pretty
high
carbonation
after
mostly
enjoying
our
homebrewed
esb
im
excited
to
bite
into
another
commercial
example
to
compare
it
to
this
one
pours
a
clear
straight
amber
im
still
looking
for
the
mosquito
its
so
ambery
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
grass
flowers
mild
caramel
and
buttery
biscuits
the
taste
adds
some
mandarin
orange
character
and
wheat
to
the
foundation
set
by
the
smell
whatever
maltiness
that
was
there
before
is
mostly
oercome
by
the
orange
and
lemongrass
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
justlight
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
a
decent
esb
but
a
bit
too
fruity
and
slightly
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
i
applaud
the
organic
effort
but
the
mix
doesnt
really
produce
a
hit
nor
a
beer
i
would
drink
regularly
overall
an
ok
beer
but
this
is
not
what
i
look
for
in
an
esb
it
is
ok
but
i
will
not
buy
this
again
the
yeasty
smell
hit
my
nose
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
and
i
liked
it
this
beer
has
a
nice
amberbrown
more
brown
appearance
with
a
two
finger
head
and
lovely
bubbles
i
havent
had
that
many
esbs
before
not
sure
why
but
it
has
a
nice
rounded
taste
some
malty
sweetness
but
also
a
biscuitybready
tatse
with
hints
of
fruit
but
not
fruity
i
would
drink
it
again
good
carbonation
and
moist
to
the
palate
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
get
this
as
an
esb
im
not
getting
the
leathery
feel
with
lemony
tea
flavors
drinkability
is
exceptional
and
evidently
the
target
its
a
bit
too
subtle
to
be
the
headline
beer
of
the
day
but
istasty
and
likeable
even
if
a
bit
shy
of
the
fizzies
i
will
admit
that
the
whole
esb
genre
is
a
newer
find
for
me
i
just
started
taking
interest
in
them
having
just
had
greenmans
version
which
was
hoppy
and
flavor
packed
i
may
have
been
expecting
the
same
with
this
organic
esb
it
is
in
no
way
similar
they
are
both
beer
this
beer
pours
cloudy
copper
and
has
a
nice
foamy
head
that
lasts
a
little
longer
than
the
other
beers
form
this
brewery
the
nose
is
fruit
and
caramel
i
can
definitely
expect
some
sweetness
if
the
smells
are
indicative
at
all
not
the
case
this
beer
is
pleasantly
bitter
and
mild
it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
one
of
the
easiest
drinkers
that
ive
had
to
date
i
really
felt
like
i
was
having
an
iced
tea
if
iced
tea
had
a
delicious
malt
aftertaste
the
medium
body
and
crispness
make
this
enjoyable
throughout
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the
title
e
s
b
but
at
least
its
decent
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
slight
scent
of
wheat
has
a
good
strong
wheat
flavor
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
to
it
drinks
rather
smooth
and
is
quite
different
from
the
taste
of
many
other
of
lakefronts
beers
organic
esb
is
well
balanced
and
drinkable
but
somewhat
lacking
in
character
cheers
to
the
fact
that
its
organic
so
drink
up
this
is
a
beer
that
was
what
i
expected
its
sold
as
an
organic
beer
so
that
makes
me
question
whether
or
not
it
has
the
needed
qualities
of
a
fully
rounded
good
beer
it
looked
good
poured
from
the
bottle
just
fine
and
had
a
nice
aroma
the
taste
was
where
it
started
to
fall
apart
it
lacked
the
depth
of
flavor
and
full
bodiness
that
the
name
secondarily
implied
it
sounds
as
though
im
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
which
im
not
but
a
beer
being
marketed
as
an
organic
isnt
destined
to
be
great
and
this
beer
proves
that
a
disappointing
offering
from
a
usually
dependable
brewer
fullers
has
nothing
to
worry
about
here
overall
not
especially
representative
to
the
style
as
ive
had
before
but
a
decent
beer
certainly
better
than
others
ive
had
in
the
style
but
not
the
best
by
a
long
shot
d
honestly
i
drained
poured
the
last
half
of
the
second
one
out
of
two
12
oz
bottles
i
only
consumed
about
10
ounces
because
of
overflow
and
drain
pouring
went
down
smooth
enough
butter
and
oil
like
texture
it
tastes
diluted
a
little
heavy
on
the
water
ive
tasted
comparable
kit
beers
so
is
thats
what
holding
so
many
bottled
esbs
back
their
insistence
on
using
english
hops
maybe
if
it
werent
for
a
mute
aroma
this
would
be
a
world
class
exemplar
of
its
style
but
at
any
rate
its
a
spectacular
session
d
well
you
really
cant
find
it
here
so
low
but
if
i
crossed
paths
with
a
fresh
bottle
i
would
have
to
try
it
again
hmmm
bitter
or
sweeter
this
beer
has
no
hop
presence
save
for
a
mild
barely
balancing
bitterness
the
rest
is
sweetness
and
not
really
a
good
sweetness
its
kinda
tart
and
unrefined
not
a
great
esb
or
beer
imo
pours
a
nice
cloudy
copper
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
spice
notes
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
bitter
slightly
spicy
with
a
good
dose
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
not
bad
at
all
d
definitely
not
what
i
would
expect
from
an
esb
i
appreciate
breweries
trying
to
make
more
organic
beers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
particularly
when
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
d
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
makes
this
pretty
drinkable
personally
i
have
not
tried
too
many
beers
of
this
style
but
i
may
try
more
now
like
everything
else
about
this
beer
the
body
is
on
the
weak
side
though
manages
to
hold
up
enough
i
would
have
been
happy
with
a
single
but
the
sixpack
wont
go
to
waste
d
satisfying
and
delicious
this
is
one
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
stuck
on
a
desert
island
with
for
the
rest
of
my
life
overall
a
nice
beer
from
lakefront
it
took
me
long
enough
to
finally
review
this
one
overall
i
really
like
this
bier
and
recommend
it
to
everyone
enjoy
prosit
so
i
dont
really
know
if
being
organic
has
anything
to
do
with
this
beer
flavor
is
kind
off
dull
maybe
from
not
being
genetically
freaky
malt
and
hops
pours
an
amber
color
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
that
has
a
slight
yellowish
tint
to
it
the
head
has
almost
no
retension
whatsoever
lacing
is
nonexistant
initial
smell
suprised
the
hell
out
of
me
as
it
was
just
like
vinegar
that
eventually
gave
way
to
a
more
pinelike
aroma
taste
is
a
little
bitter
upfront
with
the
pine
taste
and
a
slight
bit
of
citrus
in
there
as
well
really
a
crisp
finish
with
this
and
a
lingering
taste
of
the
citruspine
combo
feel
of
this
beer
is
quite
light
little
to
no
malt
presence
here
but
picking
up
on
a
bit
of
grainbiscuit
as
it
warms
this
is
just
leaving
me
looking
for
something
more
in
this
beer
but
it
just
isnt
delivering
purchased
from
trader
joes
pours
a
deep
copper
body
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
flavors
of
sweet
toffee
upfront
with
some
malt
spiciness
leads
to
a
low
bitterness
at
mid
tongue
followed
by
sweetness
again
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
very
good
but
ill
like
to
see
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
from
this
one
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
lighter
golden
color
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
pale
hops
yeast
grain
herbs
and
slight
spice
fits
the
style
of
an
esb
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
hops
herbs
slight
spice
and
slight
yeast
overall
a
decent
brew
but
the
blend
hurt
by
being
too
heavy
on
the
herbs
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
hops
taste
is
refreshing
hops
with
some
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
but
has
enough
hop
undertones
to
balance
the
beer
pretty
nicely
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
and
decent
carbonation
maybe
just
a
tad
bit
undercarbonated
overall
its
pretty
decent
stuff
if
i
ever
get
in
the
mood
for
an
e
s
b
which
admittedly
is
not
often
id
go
for
this
one
again
d
this
one
is
pretty
much
average
all
around
its
not
horrible
but
it
really
isnt
that
great
and
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
to
drink
another
at
all
pretty
glad
i
just
bought
a
single
because
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
bitter
appears
a
murky
amber
akin
to
iced
tea
with
an
inch
of
fluffy
off
white
foam
a
decent
looking
pour
nose
and
flavor
are
of
toasted
bread
sweet
and
fruity
caramel
a
touch
of
nuts
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
not
too
shabby
it
has
a
really
good
grainy
taste
with
a
small
following
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
watery
considering
how
thick
the
head
is
but
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
still
not
found
a
good
sessionable
esb
drinkability
its
pretty
decent
the
flavors
while
albeit
a
little
off
as
theres
that
bit
of
artifical
grape
aspect
to
it
the
acidic
fruitiness
is
actually
alright
and
the
malty
backing
is
quite
pleasant
the
carbonation
could
be
just
a
bit
softer
but
still
not
too
bad
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
one
or
two
bottles
of
this
on
my
next
trip
to
va
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
very
cloudy
amber
color
with
lots
of
visible
sediment
the
twofinger
fluffy
beige
head
retained
pretty
well
as
a
cap
and
left
very
good
lacing
in
curtains
at
first
then
bands
the
aroma
was
of
light
citrus
hops
spices
grapefruit
caramel
malt
and
a
little
doughy
malt
the
flavors
were
a
little
odd
starting
with
hoppy
bitterness
it
then
went
into
a
little
spice
followed
by
doughy
and
biscuity
malt
the
finish
was
crisp
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
to
come
together
properly
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
light

had
so
far
though
thats
not

all
that
much

a
great
e

a
style
that
doesnt

attention
these
days
these
were
the
session
beers
just
20
years
ago
and
i
sure
could
go
for
another
nicely
done
and
organic
too
one
finger
of
tan
foam
on
a
fairly
hazy
rusty
brown
body
the
lacing
is
okay
syrupy
candylike
malty
sweet
aroma
im
enjoying
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
right
now
really
smooth
and
easydrinking
quality
all
around
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
beautiful
clear
copper
almost
mahogany
with
a
thick
sandy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
malty
with
an
undertone
of
cinnamon
and
a
sharp
hint
of
fruit
flavor
is
on
the
thin
side
strongly
but
not
fiercely
bitter
texture
is
smooth
and
just
a
bit
watery
not
very
tingly
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
acceptable
the
feel
is
creamy
almost
in
the
vein
of
guinness
very
substantial
warming
alcohol
its
an
englishstyle
all
the
way
has
a
weird
musty
funk
but
drinkable
if
you
dont
think
about
that
part
pours
clear
copper
with
a
decent
head
that
collapses
to
nothing
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
a
weird
sour
hoppy
character
that
is
not
appetizing
the
flavor
is
sticky
and
malty
bready
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
slightly
sour
with
a
flavor
i
associated
with
inexpertly
produced
homebrew
there
is
relatively
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
more
like
a
hop
sourness
with
an
overripe
floral
hop
aroma
that
is
not
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
runny
with
little
carbonation
and
a
sour
finish
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
mouthfeel
is
a
little
chewy
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
the
bitter
really
showing
up
on
the
finish
not
exceptional
but
definitely
above
average
at
28
for
the
case
i
was
very
pleased
with
qualityprice
ratio
hazy
orange
hued
amber
color
lots
of
bubbles
shooting
up
from
the
bottom
some
floaties
slightly
fruity
smell
not
much
else
in
the
aroma
department
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
has
a
hint
of
apple
juice
slightly
peppery
but
just
for
a
second
hardly
any
noticable
hop
bitterness
just
enough
to
try
to
balance
it
out
nice
carbonation
level
crisp
but
not
overwhelming
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
not
extremely
well
balanced
d
nothing
offensive
really
but
then
again
nothing
at
all
little
smell
little
taste
little
redeeming
qualities
d
uninspired
version
of
an
esb
the
appearance
is
the
most
redeeming
quality
of
this
brew
the
scent
and
taste
arent
bad
they
are
just
incredibly
subdued
and
weak
this
beer
while
not
terrible
lacks
any
discernable
personality
smooth
crisp
well
structured
i
prefer
a
bit
more
hoppiness
but
its
a
very
good
stylistic
esb
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
imo
it
doesnt
suite
the
flavors
to
make
a
crisp
drinkable
esb
the
beer
is
very
muted
has
some
bittering
hop
flavors
but
is
mostly
a
pretty
uniform
malty
slightly
bittering
caramel
biscuity
beer
this
isnt
much
of
an
esb
but
on
its
own
the
beer
is
decent
enough
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
tangy
aftertaste
there
maybe
some
florals
wrapped
around
the
hops
somewhere
in
this
beer
but
there
isnt
enough
flavor
to
really
call
it
out
drinkable
sure
thing
i
think
this
would
be
incredible
fresh
on
tap
extremly
drinkable
and
refreshing
despite
my
flaming
disdain
for
anything
from
milwaukee
lakefront
continues
to
impress
me
a
perfect
balancing
act
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
any
type
of
meal
a
job
well
done
for
sure
d
one
of
a
sampler
but
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
more
drinkability
soso
at
best
as
with
most
organic
beers
the
flavors
seem
muted
this
needed
some
more
balancing
hop
bitterness
imho
large
light
tan
head
well
carbonated
clear
orange
brown
color
smells
like
bananas
nuts
starts
with
a
sweet
nuttiness
almonds
and
hazelnuts
toasty
mild
bitterness
predominates
moderate
alcohol
medium
body
finishes
with
some
astringency
not
quite
to
style
but
not
bad
d
an
average
beer
i
like
the
organic
nature
of
it
but
other
than
that
not
much
special
here
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
follow
style
which
in
some
cases
is
good
just
not
this
one
heres
where
i
got
confused
i
was
expecting
a
very
bitter
flavored
beer
but
that
is
not
what
i
got
it
was
actually
very
smooth
which
i
dont
know
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
its
a
good
hoppy
beer
but
not
what
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
didnt
really
taste
like
most
of
the
esbs
that
ive
had
before
but
still
wasnt
bad
d
drinkable
yes
but
to
call
this
an
esb
wtf
this
is
a
terrible
example
of
the
style
and
even
if
one
takes
it
at
face
value
its
still
a
mediocre
overly
sweet
beer
while
there
was
nothing
to
actually
dislike
about
this
beer
there
was
nothing
much
that
stuck
out
either
and
it
has
a
lot
of
growing
up
to
do
to
become
a
bitter
drinkability
really
does
not
suit
my
tastes
i
may
have
a
bad
beer
here
because
this
is
not
good
pretty
average
i
wouldnt
purposefully
get
this
again
flavor
is
not
unified
resulting
in
an
unimpressive
beer
unusual
flavors
for
an
esb
but
a
refreshing
beer
nonetheless
another
dud
from
lakefront
i
will
be
steering
clear
of
this
down
the
road
this
is
above
average
for
the
organic
beers
ive
tried
but
not
great
among
the
better
esbs
out
there
tell
ya
what
a
little
crystal
malt
to
provide
some
deeper
caramel
maltiness
and
darken
the
color
and
were
almost
there
perhaps
this
along
with
a
higher
mash
temp
would
keep
the
abv
the
same
and
add
to
the
body
if
finding
organic
crystal
malts
is
a
problem
perhaps
the
same
could
be
achieved
with
decoctions
i
know
this
adds
to
the
expense
but
it
would
be
closer
to
an
esb
d
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
a
refreshing
beer
i
could
see
putting
them
back
during
the
heart
of
summer
drinkability
is
fairly
high
flavors
are
decent
and
the
low
alcohol
makes
this
brew
pretty
sessionable
not
a
bad
choice
although
probably
not
the
best
example
stylewise
i
will
pass
on
this
one
next
time
dnot
bad
i
have
poor
luck
with
this
brewery
overall
but
this
one
was
rather
enjoyable
i
havent
had
a
great
amount
of
esbs
to
compare
this
to
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
probably
the
best
tasting
organic
beer
i
have
had
at
least
its
not
gonna
blow
you
away
but
its
certainly
drinkable
ddecent
but
not
great
esb
drinkability
i
dont
want
more
lots
of
better
esbs
out
there
overall
very
wellbalanced
beer
good
beer
from
the
boys
at
lakefront
this
is
not
a
terribly
good
esb
although
i
do
like
the
attempt
to
do
it
organic
it
did
start
to
wear
on
me
but
the
initial
funky
fruity
flavor
held
it
back
a
bit
the
combination
of
the
funky
fruit
character
and
the
buttery
diacetyl
pretty
much
kill
the
nose
for
me
as
well
a
decent
beer
but
still
not
something
id
likely
revisit
taste
is
malty
at
first
good
crisp
mouthfeel
good
caramel
presence
slight
citrusy
bitterness
at
the
end
in
the
end
though
its
fairly
onesided
copper
to
almost
red
in
color
with
lots
of
prickle
that
is
mildly
active
no
head
to
speak
of
after
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
banana
hints
in
the
nose
that
knuckle
under
to
the
dominant
smell
of
hops
clean
attack
and
smooth
flavor
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
it
presents
as
a
malty
beer
and
finishes
hoppier
no
significant
aftertaste
i
would
call
it
a
c
myself
reflection
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
likes
good
beer
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
someone
handed
me
a
free
one
notes
buy
ittry
it
and
just
remember
that
it
is
a
decent
brew
and
not
to
expect
anything
special
the
organic
label
may
be
a
temptation
for
a
lady
friend
who
is
not
so
much
into
beer
so
keep
a
few
around
i
thought
it
was
very
sweet
and
caramelized
12oz
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
as
part
of
this
brewerys
sampler
8pack
pours
amberred
with
a
quarter
inch
or
so
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
tastes
like
caramel
and
nut
with
chocolate
notes
toward
the
finish
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
a
good
example
of
the
style
for
sure
and
quite
drinkable
a
solid
esb
d
this
definitely
doesnt
taste
like
an
esb
to
me
so
regardless
to
say
i
will
not
being
having
this
again
dont
drink
and
review
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
tight
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
very
light
i
pick
up
some
caramel
malt
rust
and
some
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
of
bready
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
and
honey
this
is
followed
by
earthy
tea
like
hops
there
is
a
metallic
twang
that
runs
throughout
this
brew
the
feel
is
light
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitterness
seems
to
be
fairly
close
to
the
style
on
par
with
the
other
lakefront
offering
that
i
had
nothing
stands
out
with
this
brew
the
taste
is
similar
with
candied
citron
caramel
a
fraintly
sour
light
earthiness
a
lightly
spicey
piney
bitterness
and
a
bready
finish
its
light
and
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
and
with
a
little
too
much
of
a
candied
fruitcaramel
quality
but
has
persistent
flavour
some
complexity
and
pretty
good
balance
its
better
than
many
us
esbs
that
ive
had
d
although
nothing
really
stands
out
this
is
a
perfectly
enjoyable
and
easy
beer
to
drink
drinkability
an
off
taste
seems
to
interfere
with
the
goodness
of
this
brew
and
keeps
the
low
complexity
from
making
this
very
drinkable
d
i
kinda
liked
this
one
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
its
a
pretty
mild
drink
that
has
some
flavor
i
havent
had
many
lakefront
brews
but
the
ones
i
have
had
have
not
impressed
and
this
was
borderline
awfulpoured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
bull
copper
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
white
head
that
nver
really
tottaly
subsidedfrom
there
it
goes
way
down
hill
sour
aromas
like
apple
cider
vinegar
because
a
bit
of
green
apple
in
there
some
residual
toastiness
as
wellflavors
are
sour
and
astrigent
makeing
me
pucker
a
little
that
apple
is
really
pronounced
its
got
a
firm
toastiness
but
it
cant
help
cut
thru
the
astringency
of
this
beer
ehh
a
drain
our
nuff
said
its
not
bad
at
all
but
could
bring
a
little
more
as
far
as
flavor
good
session
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
i
dont
know
if
its
spot
on
for
the
esb
style
but
its
something
id
recommend
and
purchase
again
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
toasted
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
is
biscuity
malt
with
a
citrusy
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
decent
esb
but
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
drinkability
fairly
middleoftheroad
when
it
comes
to
the
noble
esb
style
dnot
bad
but
a
bit
too
malty
not
enough
hop
bite
and
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
certainly
drinkable
but
could
be
more
d
nice
malt
and
hop
character
but
a
bit
sweet
for
me
overall
it
is
a
reasonable
session
beer
and
a
nice
esb
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
a
lakefront
beer
after
using
their
pint
glass
for
about
a
year
a
pretty
good
sessionable
esb
here
maybe
leans
a
little
more
towards
citrus
than
herbal
hops
and
not
as
much
breadiness
or
fullness
as
other
esbs
d
this
is
a
tasty
organic
brew
with
a
nice
toasted
finish
that
i
enjoyed
id
definitely
pick
up
more
of
these
in
the
future
if
i
come
across
it
d
very
good
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
and
be
quite
content
very
nicely
balanced
esb
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
eric
poured
a
soft
head
which
disappears
completely
after
a
moment
color
is
a
golden
amber
initial
taste
is
a
slight
bitterness
with
some
malt
which
fades
away
with
the
finish
not
a
lot
of
body
nor
is
it
highly
carbonated
lacks
alotbad
esb
in
my
opinion
lakefronts
organic
esb
pours
a
clear
amber
copper
and
is
topped
by
a
smooth
beige
head
that
persists
as
a
film
the
aroma
is
clean
overall
theres
a
bit
of
breadiness
and
some
sweeter
malts
but
the
hoppiness
is
subdued
to
just
a
hint
of
resin
the
taste
was
disappointing
biscuity
malts
moderate
sweetness
throughout
and
light
herbal
resiny
bitterness
this
beer
is
lightbodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
thin
feel
on
the
palate
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
thats
because
its
lacking
in
bitterness
overall
while
the
flavors
werent
bad
at
all
the
thin
overly
sweet
body
made
this
beer
not
all
that
enjoyable
i
like
esbs
and
the
lighter
sessionability
of
them
but
this
one
seemed
to
lack
it
if
you
will
there
are
much
better
esbs
out
there
this
is
not
bad
for
a
hot
day
session
beer
but
for
a
esb
its
on
the
weak
side
worth
drinking
again
and
not
feeling
bad
about
just
no
wow
factor
appears
a
sligh
hazed
caramel
copper
with
a
cream
cofee
head
the
lacing
comes
forms
even
and
thick
with
each
sip
aroma
has
leafy
obacco
notes
with
caramel
bready
malts
a
slight
lingering
tartness
combined
with
a
metallic
citrus
hop
twang
flavor
full
of
cereal
notes
as
in
i
gotta
eat
my
wheaties
esque
with
sweetcaramel
notes
more
leafy
herbal
qualites
tea
like
really
after
few
sips
the
flavor
grew
on
me
but
it
wasnt
textbook
esb
sort
of
interesting
but
so
so
in
the
end
mouthfeel
smooth
natural
carbonation
medium
bodied
flows
nice
with
a
touch
of
acidity
lingering
drinkability
is
decent
a
nice
variety
twelve
pack
offering
but
definitely
note
a
highlight
pours
a
foggy
orange
brown
nose
is
kind
of
a
tangy
woody
earthy
kind
of
thing
flavor
is
not
smooth
way
too
much
zing
on
the
mouth
too
much
of
a
citric
edge
to
it
the
bitter
is
too
much
so
and
not
smooth
enough
to
enjoy
feel
is
decent
but
this
one
lacks
any
kind
of
smooth
aspect
to
really
be
enjoyable
i
just
have
to
say
i
dont
really
like
it
altough
quite
serviceable
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
well
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
it
looks
so
look
long
a
nice
copper
color
with
an
ok
head
that
fades
quick
the
nose
has
a
very
malty
character
with
a
little
citrus
maybe
they
lose
me
totally
on
the
taste
an
initial
malt
flavor
followed
imediatly
by
a
sour
taste
that
really
is
not
all
that
pleasant
ill
send
the
rest
of
this
beer
to
hotterthanhell
kudos
for
the
organic
angle
though
d
its
ok
i
got
it
in
a
variety
8
pack
and
its
one
of
the
better
from
lakefront
in
the
pack
but
nothing
special

2007
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
ruddied
hickory
brown
with
a
rim
of
offwhite
aroma
was
a
whiff
of
sea
salted
grain
sugars
and
light
tannic
hop
character
mellow
flavor
was
a
nice
middle
ground
with
clean
fresh
earth
bright

character
and
suave
drinkability
founded
in
a
crisp
lemony
hop
presentation
noble
and
fresh
im
actually
rather
enthused
by
the
quality
of
this
particular
example
nothing
stellar
but
good
ester
formation
nice
bright
salty
touches
and
a
fresh
presentation
underrated
in
my
book
paired
nicely
with
a
turkey
burger
final
thoughts

clean
and
refreshing
brew
its
good
but
not
special
pours
a
copper
amberish

of
a
small
hop
and
kind
of
tea
like
in
the
taste
like
iced
tea
a
bit
sweet
and
citrusy
lemon
flavor
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
lemon
citrusy
aftertaste
very
much
like
iced
tea
and
not
much
bitter
d
one
of
those
beers
that
you
drink
that
at
the
end
of
it
youre
really
not
impressed
with
it
but
its
not
bad
either
an
average
beer
ive
had
better
bitters
but
drinkable
d
not
good
i
dont
know
if
this
is
in
fact
a
bad
beer
or
not
fresh
probably
the
latter
wtf
is
going
on
here
thin
and
watery
a
hint
of
tartness
that
has
no
place
whatsoever
in
an
esb
hops
are
hiding
and
the
malt
is
weak
nothing
extra
special
nor
strong
about
this
one
lakefront
just
hit
bham
with
about
10
different
beers
maybe
they
should
focus
less
on
quantity
and
worry
more
about
quality
i
bought
singles
of
a
bunch
of
different
ones
well
see
how
the
others
hold
up
drinkability
is
good
though
this
is
a
rather
sweet
brew
overall
this
brew
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
the
hippies
will
love
that
it
is
organic
but
there
is
little
else
to
credit
this
brew
with
while
i
like
beers
that
are
a
bit
more
on
the
heavy
side
of
flavor
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
even
found
myself
taking
the
glass
out
to
my
patio
where
it
seemed
to
fit
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
like
my
last
lakefront
brew
review
id
really
like
to
give
this
a
try
from
the
tap
because
i
have
to
believe
the
bottle
might
be
taking
something
away
the
craft
of
this
beer
seems
to
be
so
well
thought
that
i
look
forward
to
another
chance
at
a
trial
pours
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
breaks
down
into
nice
lacing
looks
very
carbonated
smells
like
orange
rind
slightly
soapy
when
tasted
my
first
thought
was
subpar
homebrew
taste
is
bitter
citrus
with
some
caramel
malt
and
nothing
spectacular
lots
of
hops
medium
bodied
and
is
indeed
very
carbonated
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
something
id
pick
up
again
certified
organic
it
youre
keeping
score
an
easy
to
drink
beer
the
taste
is
somewhat
lacking
this
is
an
easy
ale
to
like
there
are
not
any
distractions
past
the
appearance
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
this
one
isnt
really
bad
in
any
aspects
but
it
is
straight
on
average
everywhere
boring
and
fairly
uninspired
id
skip
it
for
a
livelier
more
flavourful
esb
poured
a
clear
amberbrown
with
moderate
head
development
that
dissapeared
a
little
too
quickly
smell
exhibits
a
mild
hop
aroma
and
is
somewhat
malty
a
nicely
balanced
aroma
between
hops
and
malt
taste
is
malty
at
the
front
with
a
clean
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
with
adequate
levels
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
sessionquality
esb
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
organic
esb
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
not
much
else
in
the
nose
flavor
is
all
over
the
place
starts
off
sour
then
a
bit
of
butter
then
a
bit
bitter
id
skip
this
one
theres
better
beer
to
be
had
out
there
hohum
not
unpleasant
but
a
truly
forgettable
beer
pours
copper
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
very
light
with
only
a
slight
metallic
note
and
a
touch
of
dry
malt
bland
taste
with
the
faaintest
tracee
of
malt
aand
hop
flavors
but
clean
mouthfeel
is
okay
could
be
crisper
or
have
more
body
boring
i
finished
the
one
i
had
but
no
reason
to
go
back
for
more
i
know
its
a
relatively
light
style
but
there
needs
to
be
something
else
here
drink
a
fullers
instead
pours
an
orangegolden
color
with
a
faint
white
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
biscuity
malt
with
some
mildly
fruity
hops
blending
in
palate
is
again
mildly
sweet
with
notes
of
biscuit
and
light
almost
tropical
fruit
body
is
smooth
and
just
a
tad
creamy
an
easydrinking
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
ok
so
this
is
a
pleasant
tasting
brew
but
my
smell
and
taste
scores
reflect
how
well
it
fits
the
style
and
not
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
fairly
tasty
brew
but
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
blow
this
thing
out
of
the
esb
category
really
it
should
be
called
an
american
amber
because
thats
what
it
looks
and
tastes
like
give
it
a
try
but
dont
expect
to
drink
an
esb
uninteresting
drinkability
though
the
sweetness
does
maybe
make
this
less
than
a
highly
anticipated
session
beer
i
enjoyed
the
experience
and
this
is
quite
different
from
a
lot
of
esbs
ive
had
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
try
it
but
you
may
want
to
hold
back
on
more
than
that
crisp
and
sharp
mouthfeel
but
not
particularly
smooth
drinkable
in
a
pinch
but
overall
pretty
poorly
balanced
and
bland
not
typically
what
i
look
for
in
an
esb
for
a
fan
of
the
style
definitely
not
thrilled
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
orangishred
color
with
a
minimal
head
smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
amber
malt
taste
is
very
well
balanced
an
initial
sweet
maltyness
followed
by
a
dry
hoppy
slight
citrus
finish
excellent
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
but
it
goes
down
light
and
has
little
carbonation
a
definite
winner
drinkable
for
sure
i
suppose
if
you
were
on
some
organic
kick
this
beer
would
definitely
be
worth
trying

still

to
this
surprisingly
fullflavored

nice

basis
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
like
my

off
more
like
an

only
a

poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
date
on
the
side
of
the
front
label
poured
an
orangish
amber
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
went
away
in
fairness
the
bottled
on
date
was
1st
week
of
june
and
this
is
last
week
of
december
so
review
might
be
hurt
by
the
age
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
standard
the
aroma
was
biscuity
malt
with
some
sweetness
but
was
pretty
weak
overall
the
taste
was
just
average
and
not
leading
me
to
want
to
seek
out
another
mildly
recommend
3
rb
tie
o
pours
a
dull
amber
in
color
with
notable
chill
haze
creamy
off
white
head
settles
rather
quickly
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
semisour
maltdriven
nose
malty
and
yeasty
on
the
first
sip

theres
something
to
be
said
for
a
proprietary
character
which
is
evident
in
many
of
lakefronts
brews
and
i
dont
know
if
its
a
matter
of
compromised
yeast
strains
or
the
fact
that
they
use
a
lot
of
the
same
malts
in
all
of
their
brews
but
the
same
character
is
present
in
both
their
ales
and
their
lagers
its
a
sour
tangy
tinny
yeasty
quality
the
organic
esb
has
always
struck
me
as
the
single
best
idea
this
brewery
has
come
up
with
a
means
to
serve
and
cater
to
a
very
vocal
and
increasingly
powerful
segment
of
the
consumer
marketplace
that
being
the
organic
consumer
a
fresh
bottle
of
lakefronts
organic
esb
beats
the
pants
off
the
fresh
tap
of
stone
mill
pale
ale
i
had
recently
and
is
about
as
close
to
stylespecific
as
you
can
get
organic
grains
and
hops
notwithstanding
but
this
bottle
is
off
the
sour
tinny
tangy
yeasty
quality
i
noted
above
is
present
here
to
an
almost
overwhelming
degree
sure
theres
some
malt
sweetness
here
and
even
a
notable
degree
of
hop
bitterness
but
what
is
this
funky
tangy
weirdness
it
cant
be
a
water
quality
issue

can
treated
lake
michigan
water
produce
such
a
quality
someday
ill
take
their
brewery
tour
again
which
is
a
great
tour
and
try
this
stuff
fresh
from
the
brewery
versus
a
fresh
bottle
hey
a
guy
can
dream
right
at
any
rate
i
will
rerate
this
again
in
the
future
after
securing
a
fresher
bottle
but
even
as
it
stands
its
a
better
organic
ale
than
the
a
b
what
a
nice
beer
well
balanced
though
slightly
better
suited
for
the
malt
lover
than
the
hop
head
this
esb
could
be
a
good
session
beer
as
well
so
many
other
great
esb
out
there
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
not
really
for
anything
spectacular
but
because
it
is
plain
jane
this
was
my
first
of
the
lakefront
beers
i
havent
seen
them
sold
around
washington
dc
much
before
so
id
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
a
pleasant
discovery
to
say
the
least
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
1
5
finger
head
not
much
lace
left
down
the
glass
but
a
thin
film
of
head
stayed
with
with
me
a
while
longer
than
expected
nice
citrusy
aroma
with
distinct
notes
of
orange
lemon
and
tangerine
taste
was
light
but
malty
not
so
much
what
id
call
an
esb
but
definitely
not
bad
the
bitterness
kicks
in
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
after
youve
already
swallowed
sturdy
mouthfeel
overall
a
solid
session
brew
im
not
so
sure
it
deserves
to
be
called
an
esb
but
its
a
nice
beer
nevertheless
one
of
the
certified
organic
beers
out
there
like
bison
or
wolavers
which
does
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
by
the
way
an
orangeamber
beer
with
a
slight
haze
has
a
big
foamy
off
white
head
there
is
a
light
sweet
cereal
grain
character
to
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
background
the
sweetness
carries
thru
to
the
taste
where
the
caramel
note
is
more
pronounced
with
just
a
light
sting
of
bitterness
on
the
outer
edges
of
your
tongue
the
finish
is
both
sweet
and
dry
with
a
light
tea
like
note
in
the
background
the
mouth
begins
brightly
then
just
dies
on
the
palate
lacking
sufficient
carbonation
i
think
and
then
finishes
with
the
aformentioned
aftertaste
thus
the
drinkablility
is
pretty
low
overall
an
okay
beer
but
a
bit
disappointed
after
hearing
so
many
other
beer
drinkers
talk
it
up
out
of
the
esbs
ive
tried
to
date
this
was
just
not
doing
it
for
me
clear
copper
amber
body
is
topped
by
a
small
beige
head
good
retention
and
some
spiderweb
lacing
aroma
is
biscuity
caramel
malt
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
and
a
hint
of
red
apple
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
but
unfortunately
thins
considerably
to
the
point
of
being
watery
by
the
end
of
the
glass
taste
is
pretty
good
for
style
with
bready
caramel
maltiness
that
is
balanced
well
by
fruity
and
citrusy
hops
a
hint
of
pear
is
noticed
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
effort
and
very
sessionable
way
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
category
however
mohagany
colored
with
a
medium
fizzy
egg
foam
head
smell
is
yeasty
with
notes
of
yeast
phenols
and
a
bready
aroma
solid
fruit
precense
and
some
butterscotch
sweetness
flavor
is
similar
but
less
yeast
driven
a
bit
of
minty
flavors
in
there
and
even
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
but
its
more
of
a
light
fruit
complexity
beer
bready
base
floral
hop
notes
at
the
top
zip
in
finish
is
my
only
real
problem
as
it
gets
metallic
body
is
smooth
and
slick
medium
in
feel
not
heavy
at
all
flavors
arent
heavy
either
almost
too
little
really
although
the
yeast
gives
medium
weight
the
flavors
dont
quite
hold
their
own
a
bit
more
malts
and
hops
the
same
proportion
already
used
and
this
could
be
really
good
for
now
its
decent
to
solid
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1

white
head
over
the
clear
coppery
amber
brew
thick
head
lasts
very
nicely
with
tons
of
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
ample
grains
with
light
hops
character
taste
begins
with
average
malt
levels
hits
with
a
tart
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
then
balances
with
some
soft
bitterness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
hurt
by
the
seemingly
outofplace
tartness
in
the
middle
made
me
not
want
to
revisit
this
one
overall
a
very
drinkable
esb
unique
because
it
is
organic
however
does
not
stand
out
among
other
esbs
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
somewhat
lacking
in
complexity
but
very
good
none
the
less
the
lack
of
complexity
is
probably
what
makes
it
so
easy
to
suck
down
less
thinking
and
more
drinking
drinkability
fairly
good
actually
one
of
the
better
organic
beers
insert
grain
of
salt
i
have
tried
drinkability
not
my
favorite
esb
and
not
super
drinkable
im
hoping
i
got
a
bad
bottle
as
the
tart
finish
was
distracting
and
the
beer
lacked
all
the
subtlety
that
i
normally
expect
of
esbs
as
a
style
there
was
definitely
a
nice
set
of
flavors
in
there
but
they
often
had
a
hard
time
coming
through
more
initially
palate
development
might
have
helped
here
im
planning
on
returning
to
this
beer
and
will
hopefully
have
reason
then
to
adjust
my
review
this
esb
is
nice
in
the
fruityhoppy
foot
forward
but
i
would
like
to
see
a
more
complex
malt
profile
that
perhaps
a
marris
otter
malt
can
give
also
more
east
kent
goldings
or
fuggle
hop
aroma
and
flavor
could
be
a
welcome
12
ounce
bottle
a
pretty
drinkable
esb
pours
out
to
an
orange
brown
color
with
a
small
head
of
white
foam
that
calms
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
that
sit
atop
the
beer
lower
levels
of
carbonation
some
notes
of
lace
aroma
is
weak
but
traces
of
malty
bread
and
spices
were
noted
with
a
touch
of
mild
hops
taste
is
enjoyable
malty
carmel
notes
blend
with
roasted
grain
and
some
hoppy
oil
notes
mouthfeel
was
unremarkable
but
acceptable
drinkability
is
slightly
north
of
average
i
dig
that
this
is
an
organic
beer
worth
trying
this
brew
pours
a
clear
dark
red
color
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
creamy
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
well
what
is
there
isnt
bad
it
is
just
faint
if
you
try
really
hard
you
ccan
smell
dark
fruits
with
a
generic
malty
sweetness
but
the
extra
effort
it
takes
to
smell
the
aroma
is
worth
what
you
get
in
return
the
taste
is
not
unlike
the
aroma
faint
and
underwhelming
again
it
isnt
bad
but
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
is
a
bit
watery
overall
this
isnt
a
very
good
esb
and
i
do
not
plan
on
drinking
it
again
well
put
together
beer
that
makes
you
want
more
will
look
for
this
one
again
d
seems
like
the
flavors
dont
mesh
as
they
should
taste
more
like
and
altbier
to
me
rather
than
and
esb
drinkability
very
drinkable
one
could
easily
throw
back
a
few
on
a
pleasant
friday
summer
evening
after
work
while
sitting
on
the
porch
this
is
the
second
sixpack
ive
purchased
the
first
pack
i
tried
was
excellent
this
time
around
the
beer
tastes
more
common
like
a
miller
high
life
it
could
be
that
ive
been
spoiled
by
drinking
a
lot
of
ipas
and
imperial
ipas
though
still
a
great
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
is
looking
to
move
up
from
macro
beers
to
the
finer
micros
drinkability
im
captivated
by
this
beers
aromait
must
be
similar
to
some
perfume
my
mom
wore
when
i
was
a
baby
because
im
irresistably
drawn
to
it
other
than
that
the
beer
is
good
but
unexceptional
drinkability
why
no
complexity
no
balance
no
depth
no
reason
to
buy
it
doesnt
even
stick
very
close
to
the
style
drinks
like
a
megabrew
attempt
at
a
real
beer
back
to
the
drawing
board
folks
this
is
a
decent
beer
worth
trying
lakefront
organic
esb
isnt
extra
special
it
isnt
strong
and
it
isnt
all
that
bitter
given
the
fact
that
im
drinking
this
bottle
at
what
should
be
the
peak
of
its
powers
it
was
bottled
about
one
month
ago
its
lackluster
showing
is
even
more
disappointing
of
course
its
a
damn
sight
better
than
lakefronts
execrable
pumpkin
lager
the
flavor
flashbacks
from
that
one
still
cause
me
to
break
out
in
a
cold
sweat
id
say
avoid
this
one
even
if
you
like
esbs
delicate
lightly
sweet
caramelaccented
and
subtly
toasty
malts
combine
with
a
thin
thread
of
yeasty
fruitiness
and
billowing
grassy
and
floral
hops
to
give
this
crystalclear
dark
amber
brew
a
quaffability
thats
worth
noting
its
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
with
just
enough
character
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
it
makes
an
excellent
session
ale
serves
as
a
great
introductory
beer
to
the
uninitiated
and
also
works
well
for
a
backyard
bbq
or
sunny
sporting
event
its
worth
trying
and
it
gets
bonus
points
for
being
organic
overall
this
is
a
rather
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
phenominal
ive
had
better
esbs
but
this
is
still
worth
a
try
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
probably
the
least
enjoyable
of
the
sampler
ill
sticky
with
my
unorganic
stuff
instead
as
far
as
esbs
go
this
is
decent
for
the
style
but
i
dont
like
them
in
general
clear
copper
color
small
white
head
fades
fast
swwet
carmel
malts
combined
with
a
metallic
tang
and
slight
floral
hops
taste
is
very
smooth
and
nonintrusive
pretty
bland
they
shouldve
called
it
organic
kob
kind
of
bland
needs
to
be
served
warmer
than
i
did
cellar
temp
so
maybe
room
temp
not
very
interesting
but
not
bad
either
clear
gold
in
hue
there
is
a
nice
yeast
haze
that
glitters
when
held
to
a
light
it
is
like
looking
a
vegas
from
an
airplane
okay
not
quite
the
head
was
white
in
color
about
a
finger
in
height
head
retention
was
acceptable
the
foam
slowly
faded
to
a
fizzy
cap
this
cap
lasted
a
few
more
seconds
before
during
to
a
thin
collar
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
infrequent
the
first
couple
sniffs
of
the
nose
were
very
nice
fruity
bready
toasty
caramel
grassyflowery
hoppiness
and
then
i
set
my
glass
down
when
i
picked
it
up
again
a
moment
later
a
vegetable
aroma
was
noticeable
yuck
this
scent
is
very
very
weak
but
i
could
still
make
it
out
overall
the
potency
of
the
nose
is
low
it
is
kind
of
clean
too
the
bouquet
has
a
flaw
but
it
still
tolerable
not
quite
inviting
though
the
palate
is
decent
no
flaws
there
isnt
much
going
on
really
what
flavors
are
in
play
is
a
balanced
offering
of
mildly
zest
citrus
hints
some
flowers
and
a
kiss
of
grass
from
the
hops
light
bitterness
the
malt
offers
a
weak
suggestion
of
caramel
and
toasty
bread
this
beer
falls
in
the
realm
of
an
esb
it
could
be
way
more
flavorful
malts
could
be
richer
drier
as
well
hops
could
offer
more
bitterness
more
liveliness
it
is
the
balance
that
saves
this
beer
and
like
i
said
it
is
okay
mediumlight
in
body
thin
light
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
empty
sad
drinkability
is
limited
one
bottle
will
be
enough
for
me
it
is
another
yawner
from
lf
it
was
purchased
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
in
milwaukee
wi
its
a
very
nice
break
from
the
usual
beers
and
might
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
a
person
into
the
world
of
ipas
and
hoppier
beers
tolerable
and
easily
enjoyed
pours
a
soft
head
which
disappears
completely
after
a
moment
color
is
a
pleasant
amber
initial
taste
is
a
slight
bitterness
with
some
malt
which
fades
away
with
the
finish
not
a
lot
of
body
nor
is
it
highly
carbonated
makes
a
decent
session
beer
but
theres
little
unique
about
it
this
beer
has
a
dark
orangebrown
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
topping
it
the
scent
is
floralbitter
hop
with
a
buttery
tone
to
it
the
taste
has
a
buttery
feel
caramel
malts
bitter
hops
somewhat
of
a
weird
flavor
present
like
tobacco
or
wellwater
or
something
the
organic
aspect
leads
to
a
unique
taste
but
i
cant
say
its
the
best
in
the
land
fluffy
white
head
with
heavy
lacing
nice
rust
color
with
little
aroma
the
taste
itself
was
pretty
bitter
with
decent
hoppiness
this
is
a
very
crisp
beer
with
a
grainlike
finish
the
taste
left
on
the
tongue
is
very
dry
and
somewhat
unrefreshing
this
is
not
my
favorite
but
i
do
believe
it
is
a
decent
brew
by
lakefront
i
do
like
the
whole
organic
thing
clear
orangey
copper
color
frothy
pale
creamcolored
head
sticks
in
nice
fluffy
patches
on
the
glass
pleasant
brown
sugarcinnamon
smell
slightly
buttery
a
little
on
the
fleeting
side
for
mouthfeel
more
would
be
better
malt
dominates
the
profile
toffee
maybe
bare
molasses
but
the
thin
texture
makes
it
go
away
too
fast
this
leaves
you
wanting
because
the
hoppiness
is
light
for
the
style
just
lightly
prickly
and
not
enough
to
save
the
finish
from
being
pretty
ordinary
could
use
more
body
and
spicy
elements
for
an
esb
though
its
attractive
and
decently
drinkable
i
may
begin
advocating
pesticides
a
sudden
arid
grip
of
stemmy
tannins
shuts
down
the
finish
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
light
and
of
malt
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
light
hops
medium
body
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
nicely
bittered
by
the
hops
and
have
a
pleasant
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
in
quantity
poured
a
chilled
hazed
amber
with

middle

flavors
also
emerge
at
this
point
and

themsleves
for
a

not
a

just
boring
thanks

lakefront
organic
esb
decent
thick
offwhite

great
color
on
this
beer
deep
brassy
color
and
the
beer
is
virtually
clear
pleasant
aroma
initially
very
sweet
with
hints
of
new
mown
hay
lingering
nice
malty
taste
with
some
initial
sweetness
however
the
beer
goes
dry
fairly
quickly
with
a
clean
aftertaste
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
interesting
alcohol
warmth
towards
the
end
decent
pours
a
clear
light
copper
has
a
head
that
stays
at
around
14
inch
and
leaves
patches
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
pretty
mild
with
some
grass
and
bread
notes
flavor
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
some
breadlike
flavors
a
pleasant
earthy
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
low
carbonation
this
is
very
subtle
for
an
esb
but
makes
for
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
and
formed
a
nice
white
head
that
subsided
quickly
and
left
some
lace
the
aroma
was
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
slight
fruit
aspect
the
flaor
was
of
hops
and
malt
with
citrus
overtones
the
finish
was
astrigent
but
not
bad
very
light
golden
and
very
clear
doesnt
look
the
way
i
expect
an
esb
to
look
smell
is
soft
nutty
and
toasty
sweet
tasting
at
the
start
with
a
spicy
finish
the
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
interesting
beer
nutsslight
caramel
hits
you
first
but
then
quick
burst
of
spicy
hops
hit
you
on
the
finish
i
downgraded
a
little
for
the
look
and
the
aroma
but
overall
this
is
worth
drinking
this
beer
is
absolutely
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
definite
orange
highlights
nice
frothy
white
head
a
bit
of
a
fruitiness
on
the
nose
some
definite
earthy
hop
tones
on
the
tongue
a
shallow
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
in
a
bitter
nicely
balanced
has
a
unique
taste
that
i
think
stems
from
the
organic
nature
of
this
beer
golden
beer
with
some
chill
haze
and
a
thin
lacy
head
smell
is
clean
and
malty
with
some
floral
hop
aroma
cutting
through
upfront
floral
hop
and
sweet
maltiness
cleaned
up
by
a
pleasantly
piercing
bitterness
a
very
clean
beer
light
yeast
character
strong

and
thick

an
excellent

with
a
good
sized

that
persists

quite
a

decent

a
litle
not
enough

overall
pretty
average
esb
a
nice
change
of
pace
amid
all
the
browns
and
pumpkin
ales
that
hit
the
market
every
fall
but
also
a
pretty
passable
offering
very
sorry
i
went
to
this
pub
food
was
ok
but
the
beers
were
mediocre
to
poor
o
mediocre
at
best
lacks
character
and
pumpkin
flavor
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
and
it
has
a
reddish
color
body
with
a
very
small
head
to
it
the
smell
has
a
malty
carmel
taste
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
and
malty
a
little
velvety
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
get
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
smooth
and
overall
is
a
ok
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
non
stoutporter
beers
odreally
gotta
respect
their
fall
seasonal
is
an
esb
i
think
more
brewers
should
experiment
with
this
style
enjoyable
beer
and
its
been
around
for
quite
a
whole
too
surprised
its
taken
me
this
long
to
try
o
great
caramel
malt
base
is
run
down
a
bit
by
the
sharpness
of
the
hops
still
a
fine
dinner
or
holiday
brew
when
you
want
something
slightly
different
but
still
basically
very
english
not
a
pumpkin
beer
but
a
fall
spiced
english
bitter
type
orange
copper
in
color
looks
the
part
but
again
from
grittys
where
is
the
head
no
foam
at
all
this
beer
looks
entirely
flat
it
smells
like
an
esb
with
some
brown
ale
type
of
malts
and
a
touch
of
amber
sweetness
gentle
but
definite
clove
and
allspice
notes
and
perhaps
vanilla
or
honey
sweetness
on
the
closing
not
extremely
complex
or
unique
but
a
plenty
palatable
heap
of
flavors
thrown
together
here
like
all
of
their
beers
at
grittys
it
needs
a
lot
more
carbonation
and
texture
to
it
this
feels
like
a
glass
of
water
with
a
better
feel
this
beer
could
do
it
for
me
but
for
now
there
are
so
many
other
higher
quality
fall
seasonals
that
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
one
for
awhile
maybe
a
good
brew
for
those
new
to
spiced
ales
as
the
flavors
are
quite
relaxed
on
that
front
a
drinkable
fall
offering
and
at
7
99
a
12
pack
from
supreme
liquors
im
really
glad
i
decided
to
try
this
out
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
orangey
amber
thin
off
white
head
with
a
bit
of
side
cling
a
few
sad
streams
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
primarily
malts
a
small
bit
of
smokey
sweetness
also
able
to
pick
up
a
bit
of
sour
something
like
a
lime
flavor
was
a
slightly
bitter
tangey
malt
nicely
developed
to
want
one
to
keep
drinking
felt
good
in
the
mouth
well
coated
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
it
was
a
nice
beer
but
really
had
nothing
to
tie
it
to
halloween
overall
great
brew
i
usually
find
my
self
having
a
few
of
these
around
september
and
october
goes
great
wiht
some
fresh
game
meat
or
poultry
o
i
cant
see
why
they
would
market
an
esb
far
inferior
to
the
grittys
bitter
i
suppose
youve
got
to
do
some
market
pandering
but
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
than
a
halloween
label
and
a
its
not
a
pumpkinbeer
presentation
o
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
unique
take
on
a
halloween
beer
the
lack
of
pumpkin
and
the
style
are
quite
unusual
choices
sessionable
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
another
of
these
perfect
for
fall
o
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
fall
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
seasonal
but
dont
want
a
pumpkin
ale
or
a
märzen
it
is
also
rather
easy
to
drink
o
fullflavored
beer
that
i
always
come
back
every
season
it
comes
out
since
ive
lived
in
maine
sweet
and
caramelly
like
halloween
candy
d
i
can
sort
of
see
the
woodsy
caramel
apple
thing
a
few
folks
mention
maybe
with
a
less
bitter
beer
i
might
get
that
too
or
tone
down
the
butter
and
keep
it
an
esb
as
is
i
find
it
a
discordant
muddled
mess
usually
i
like
a
touch
of
diacetyl
in
certain
styles
but
this
one
was
hard
to
finish
o
a
nicely
sessionable
esb
not
sure
what
makes
it
halloween
but
its
good
nonetheless
o
a
delicious
brew
could
be
renamed
something
else
and
kept
on
as
a
year
long
the
cpj
had
it
again
in
2012
still
very
nice
we
had
it
with
pot
roast
tonight
and
i
can
tell
you
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
have
with
a
new
england
pot
roast
d
one
of
my
favorite
autumn
ales
and
a
solid
bitter
ale
not
over
flavored
and
spiced
like
many
halloween
ales
thanks
bendurgin
for
the
opportunity
i
love
the
idea
of
a
halloween
ale
without
spices
this
beer
conjures
up
scenes
of
fallen
autumn
leaves
swirling
in
a
cold
breeze
freshly
turned
black
soil
destined
for
a
hard
winter
freeze
spicy
toast
flavor
like
wood
fired
stoves
mingling
with
a
damp
rain
halloween
in
new
england
indeed
rich
full
caramel
flavor
its
sweet
but
theres
enough
hop
to
keep
this
from
being
coy
full
bodied
and
below
average
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
more
bitter
than
the
taste
but
the
sweetness
remains
toffeeish
revised
review
im
not
sure
what
happened
the
last
time
but
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
much
better
this
time
around
its
got
a
spicy
caramel
flavor
to
it
with
a
creamy
medium
body
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
good
the
second
time
around
initially
confused
by
the
name
halloween
ale
and
subsequently
confused
by
its
listing
as
an
esb
pours
a
rusty
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
scent
is
a
light
touch
of
buttery
caramel
earthy
and
herbally
hop
notes
light
musty
and
damp
earth
a
bit
of
watery
fruit
and
a
faint
kiss
of
peppery
spice
taste
follows
scent
faintly
bitter
with
a
definite
presence
of
english
hops
its
star
attraction
the
apple
fruitiness
throws
the
taste
off
a
touch
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
smooth
and
maybe
a
touch
to
caramelly
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
stands
out
decent
brew
here
although
the
autumn
color
is
really
the
nicest
part
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
rich
ruby
coloring
that
starts
with
a
thin
quarterinch
head
of
offwhite
foamy
froth
that
quickly
settles
into
a
ring
the
nose
is
rich
with
crystal
malt
and
there
is
a
slight
grain
richness
to
it
also
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
in
mouth
and
the
flavors
are
a
roasted
caramel
sweetness
and
bitter
bite
of
hops
at
the
end
the
light
body
and
increased
carbonation
makes
the
end
flavors
sharp
and
clean
leaving
an
aftertaste
of
rich
nut
and
caramel
the
finish
is
neat
and
quick
with
a
slight
tang
left
bouncing
around
the
palate
decent
brew
pours
brown
with
some
orange
hue
there
was
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
there
is
the
light
smell
of
caramel
along
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
which
is
a
surprise
considering
the
abv
is
not
terribly
high
the
taste
has
nuts
bread
and
caramel
in
it
with
a
slight
alcohol
finish
not
unpleasant
or
cidery
at
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
id
be
more
apt
to
call
it
an
aggressive
brown
ale
not
an
esb
o
ive
had
this
brew
plenty
of
times
i
recommend
the
22
oz
the
most
for
some
reason
it
never
ends
up
coming
out
as
good
on
tap
which
i
know
is
odd
maybe
im
just
unlucky
i
reviewed
this
before
but
it
seemed
to
have
disappeared
i
look
forward
to
getting
this
beer
every
year
very
drinkable
recommended
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
soft
gives
off
a
lingering
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
not
to
bad
i
tend
to
grab
a
sixer
of
this
at
some
point
in
the
season
d
very
good
and
easy
drinking
wish
i
had
more
than
just
a
bottle
a
great
example
of
a
well
balanced
esb
tastes
like
autumn
quite
drinkable
d
this
is
a
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
ale
not
sure
if
its
a
good
example
of
an
esb
but
a
solid
offering
nonetheless
a
masterpiece
that
well
miss
soon
enoughall
good
seasonals
seems
to
be
that
way
every
day
cant
be
halloween
either
hands
down
one
of
our
most
favorite
esbs
ever
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
think
this
works
very
well
overall
still
slightly
traditional
while
at
the
same
time
being
nicely
adventurous
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
just
disappointing
after
such
a
great
first
impression
tasting
experience
needs
to
match
the
aroma
experience
somewhat
surprised
to
see
a
cask
of
this
in
philly
i
thought
casks
have
but
a
short
life
span
guess
im
wrong
this
was
a
pretty
stand
up
esb
i
have
no
idea
where
the
special
spices
phrase
used
in
the
description
on
the
beer
menu
came
into
play
this
drank
like
a
straightup
bitter
nothing
fancy
without
any
subtle
unique
twist
pours
with
an
excellent
thick
creamy
head
leaving
pictureperfect
sheets
of
lacing
the
color
is
a
blandish
coppery
hue
which
i
suppose
is
deadon
with
a
real
english
bitter
from
my
experience
round
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
aroma
delicious
fruity
moderately
malty
flavor
in
the
immediate
background
a
wonderfully
balanced
bitterness
against
the
other
flavors
drinks
a
little
thicker
than
a
real
low
gravity
session
ale
but
to
my
american
palette
it
was
superb
if
its
6
id
be
hardpressed
to
notice
i
hope
this
is
around
philly
more
often
really
enjoyed
it
d
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
something
that
can
be
enjoyed
with
food
or
on
its
own
drinkability
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
not
more
refreshing
and
different
the
bitterness
at
the
end
that
comes
from
the
hops
doesnt
do
it
for
me
that
being
said
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
other
seasonal
beers
at
this
time
of
year
drinkability
the
spicy
and
dark
roasted
malts
keep
me
coming
back
for
me
after
every
sip
i
kept
this
review
short
and
sweet
but
i
did
enjoy
this
brew
cheers
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
tasty
esb
props
to
grittys
for
making
an
esb
fall
seasonal
in
a
sea
of
marzen
and
pumpkin
beers
cheers
the
abv
was
a
tad
higher
that
i
would
have
been
led
to
believe
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
a
few
of
these
couldnt
be
downed
in
a
sitting
while
its
not
as
bold
or
smoky
as
the
other
seasonals
that
are
out
now
this
would
be
great
for
the
slightly
more
experienced
beer
drinker
that
wants
something
fitting
for
this
time
of
the
year
mine
will
be
long
gone
by
halloween
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
despite
all
the
carbonation
i
could
see
it
doesnt
feel
too
strongly
carbonated
there
is
a
noticeable
coat
that
leaves
some
flavor
to
linger
each
sip
goes
down
well
enough
i
find
the
effects
of
the
ringwood
yeast
to
be
lesser
than
in
other
beers
that
use
this
yeast
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
but
probably
only
if
it
was
all
thats
available
in
my
fridge
otherwise
i
think
i
would
mix
it
up
with
some
of
grittys
other
beers
if
i
were
at
one
of
their
pubs
halloween
stout
bitter
halloween
etc
i
do
think
it
would
be
quite
good
on
cask
all
in
all
worth
trying
if
you
are
not
a
drinker
who
immediately
writes
off
all
ringwood
beers
id
drink
a
6pack
of
this
on
halloween
i
guess
half
the
reason
would
be
because
of
the
label
though
clear
deep
mahogony
with
nicely
structured
thick
tan
head
aromatic
nutty
toastiness
overlays
of
sweet
caramelbutterscoth
rich
spicy
toasty
malt
start
followed
by
a
slick
butternessdiacetyl
finishes
with
a
nice
bitterness
towards
the
back
of
the
throat
nice
little
alcohol
warmth
afterwards
overall
a
fine
complex
brew
from
maine
served
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
deep
amber
in
colour
with
a
little
head
retention
sweet
aroma
with
no
discernable
hops
noticeable
residual
sugars
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
nice
up
front
malt
character
with
a
nutty
finish
balanced
very
lightly
with
hops
overall
a
nice
fall
beer
difficult
drinkability
on
a
hot
day
but
excellent
with
food
this
beer
is
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
good
lacing
sweet
maltyness
to
start
and
finishes
with
a
easy
bitterness
and
a
nuttyness
there
is
another
taste
i
couldnt
place
my
girlfriend
described
it
as
all
spice
and
gum
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
grittys
best
my
server
brought
it
to
me
with
a
light
dusting
of
offtan
head
that
hung
around
as
wisps
throughout
color
was
a
deep
rich
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
ginger
like
halloween
at
a
lot
of
places
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
lightly
musty
spicy
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
mildly
spicy
and
pumpkin
pieish
but
a
ive
had
better
halloween
ales
and
b
grittys
offers
much
better
beers
ill
have
one
of
those
next
just
a
fantastic
esb
maybe
the
best
american
one
ive
ever
tasted
d
the
beer
is
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
a
couple
will
treat
you
right
2009
batch
with
an
expiration
date
of
october
2010
sampled
on
november
5
2009
it
poured
a
good
looking
brown
with
tinges
of
ruby
red
and
mahogany
the
head
is
thin
but
the
overall
appearance
is
of
great
clarity
sweet
malts
and
fresher
hops
balance
out
the
aroma
but
they
balance
each
other
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
and
full
of
substance
the
taste
sports
a
bit
of
caramel
along
with
bitterness
roasted
malts
and
hops
if
i
had
not
seen
the
label
and
tasted
it
blindly
i
might
have
thought
it
was
an
english
strong
ale
rather
than
an
autumn
or
pumpkin
spice
ale
it
has
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
really
a
great
beer
to
sit
enjoy
on
a
crisp
fall
night
noticeable
alcohol
but
not
so
much
to
prevent
you
from
enjoying
more
than
one
d
this
would
be
a
really
nice
esb
to
session
at
a
halloween
party
when
you
dont
feel
like
an
oktoberfest
or
pumpkin
ale
but
dont
want
to
reach
for
a
stout
or
porter
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
a
good
showcase
of
malt
complexity
and
a
nice
abv
to
boot
its
a
shame
halloween
only
comes
once
a
year
numbers
my
opportunities
to
have
a
grittys
esb
would
i
buy
more
of
it
next
halloween
ill
go
back
and
buy
some
more
if
you
have
access
to
this
give
it
a
shot
happy
halloween
drinkability
a
decent
brew
that
is
a
good
drinkerm
but
doesnt
provide
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
or
contemplation
okay
medium
body
with
a
good
bit
of
spiciness
up
front
with
some
subtle
hop
notes
im
picking
up
some
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
as
well
as
some
subtle
clove
and
vanilla
there
is
a
nice
toasty
biscuit
maltiness
that
provides
nice
body
and
very
subtle
dry
bitterness
from
the
hops
based
on
the
aroma
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
hops
but
the
maltiness
and
autumnal
pumpkin
pie
spices
dominate
the
flavor
of
this
beer
the
abv
is
very
well
masked
and
theexcellent
balance
make
this
brew
very
drinkable
drinkability
overall
i
can
see
drinking
halloween
ale
while
scaring
the
crap
out
of
trick
or
treaters
or
just
hanging
out
on
a
cool
fall
night
its
drinkable
interesting
and
combines
the
perfect
components
for
a
good
cool
weather
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
reccommend
you
do
to
d
very
easy
to
sit
down
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
and
enjoy
this
beer
d
moderate
good
with
some
grillin
some
bbq
etc
id
actually
prefer
this
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
than
a
cool
oct
afternoon
but
still
a
decent
brew
if
youre
looking
for
an
esb
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
with
a
bit
of
spin
put
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
grows
on
you
at
first
i
was
a
bit
confused
but
i
was
solidly
behind
it
by
the
end
of
the
pint
d
i
enjoyed
it
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
time
very
unique
beer
drank
it
slowly
as
i
didnt
want
too
many
ghosts
and
goblins
inside
me
at
the
same
time
thanks
to
ryan
rrheisler
for
sending
me
this
bottle
as
an
extra
thanks
a
ton
drinkability
minus
the
slight
carbonation
its
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
could
drink
steadily
it
begins
to
border
a
stout
but
yet
has
slightly
more
flavor
then
i
expected
worth
the
try
drinkability
i
cannot
wait
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
halloween
night
but
will
have
some
before
and
after
that
day
its
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
fall
seasonals
it
has
such
a
great
malty
flavor
yet
light
on
the
palate
so
awesome
on
the
cool
fall
evenings
its
awesome
looking
forward
to
having
it
off
cask
at
the
grittys
in
freeport
taste
is
good
not
sure
what
the
style
is
upon
tasting
i
now
see
its
an
esb
interesting
for
a
fall
beer
its
nice
and
warm
and
fairly
complex
reminds
me
of
long
trail
harvest
d
rated
high
as
this
was
always
a
goto
beer
for
me
that
i
liked
to
drink
a
bunch
of
not
to
overpowering
but
delightful
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
i
threw
two
pints
of
this
down
with
dinner
easy
i
could
have
had
more
had
i
not
had
to
drive
medium
body
smooth
overall
with
acidic
and
resinous
texture
in
the
finish
mildly
prickly
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
autumn
beer
with
the
caramel
flavors
and
descent
abv
its
a
great
way
to
be
ready
for
the
colder
months
of
fall
reddish
brown
leaning
more
towards
brown
lacy
light
head
light
hops
caramel
and
maybe
some
citrus
in
aroma
tastes
better
as
it
warms
up
but
still
not
anything
special
balanced
earthy
tones
malt
and
light
hops
eh
its
ok
maybe
what
would
be
better
with
more
body
served
from
a
longneck
into
an
american

after
warming
up
a

with

and
a
metallic
toffee
flavor
grassy
bitter
finish
pops
up
with
a
dextrinous
grainy
note
mediumfull
feel
with
smooth
carbonation
a
pretty
easy
ale
to
drink
with
a
good
balance
of
bittering
and
sweet
malts
it
came
across
as
an
english
style
copper
ale
to
me
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
but
i
may
have
gotten
it
if
i
had
opened
it
a
month
ago
it
has
had
a
bit
of
a
rest
in
the
fridge
its
a
seasonal
offering
worth
a
try
nothing
to
search
out
for
though
good
beer
gritty
mcduffs
halloween
ale
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
malty
the
flavor
has
a
strong
malty
presence
but
the
hops
balance
it
out
nicely
toward
the
end
there
is
also
a
touch
of
spicyness
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
there
is
also
a
buttery
taste
that
fits
this
beer
well
pretty
enjoyable
definitely
worth
a
try
decent
because
it
does
not
taste
too
strong
a
wellbalanced
offering
but
not
memorable
not
overwhelmingly
flavorful
or
interesting
but
still
a
fine
experience
would
have
again
very
cool
halloween
label
as
well
drinkability
i
rather
liked
this
one
i
thought
the
maltystyle
esb
was
done
very
well
and
its
definately
not
your
runofthemill
october
beer
if
your
an
esb
fan
and
want
to
try
one
that
has
an
autumn
style
to
it
check
this
one
out
i
most
certainly
will
be
again
gotta
love
the
label
though
dfairly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
decent
session
beer
this
is
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
its
a
fall
seasonal
but
isnt
an
octoberfest
or
a
pumpkin
ale
what
do
we
have
on
our
hands
then
i
detected
almost
a
hybrid
it
has
the
pumpkin
ale
spices
but
the
maltiness
and
mouthfeel
of
an
octoberfest
i
thought
it
was
lacking
a
bit
on
the
body
as
it
was
a
bit
too
thin
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
pours
a
dark
caramel
with
an
initially
decent
head
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
malt
with
hop
undertones
taste
follows
the
smell
nice
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
that
allows
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
that
is
good
easy
enough
on
the
drinkability
scale
overall
a
decent
above
average
brew
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
deep
auburn
color
with
sticky
chunky
creamy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
forever
smooth
mellow
maltiness
and
slightly
creamy
there
a
slight
hops
scent
smooth
mildly
sweet
malts
and
slight
citrusness
followed
by
sharp
bitterness
with
mild
malty
and
bitter
aftertaste
very
rich
and
smooth
this
is
nearly
a
full
bodied
yet
not
filling
beer
great
autumn
beer
easy
to
drink
i
only
had
the
one
bottle
so
the
bitterness
may
have
limited
me
if
i
had
more
but
overall
a
very
solid
beer
overall
this
sample
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
know
they
call
the
style
an
extra
special
bitter
yet
the
finish
had
too
much
bitterness
and
lacked
an
enticing
flavor
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
reasonably
complex
you
will
experience
a
fairly
carbonated
esb
which
is
medium
bodied
loads
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malts
there
is
a
buttery
quality
to
the
beer
probably
from
the
yeast
and
a
spicy
nutmeg
sharpness
that
is
more
than
just
tea
like
hops
in
the
finish
there
is
an
oaky
quality
to
this
beer
too
that
adds
some
complexity
to
the
caramel
malts
this
is
a
tad
sweeter
than
most
of
esb
style
ales
i
have
had
but
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
medium
body
fair
carbonation
a
great
fallcooler
weather
beer
sometimes
tough
to
find
grab
this
when
you
can
the
taste
is
sweet
upfront
toffee
herbal
slightly
bitter
a
perfect
blend
of
earthy
bitterness
and
toffee
sweetness
that
melts
on
the
tongue
delicious
and
bready
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
but
nothing
that
takes
away
from
the
beer
this
is
a
solid
esb
i
will
de
be
visiting
again
d
a
gentle
burbon
boozy
alcohol
fade
is
pretty
much
the
only
redeeming
quality
this
beer
has
to
offer
and
not
worthy
of
a
recommend
average
at
best
drinkability
and
enjoyment
and
would
of
never
have
guessed
this
to
be
an
esb
d
this
one
was
an
easy
drinker
and
quite
tasty
too
id
definitely
get
this
again
next

not
a
huge
fan
of
esbs
but
this
one
was
all
right
the
spice
addition
definitely
kept
it
interesting
and
drinkable
and
made
for
a
nice
fall
beer
even
as
i
sit
here
drinking
it
in
january
drinkability
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
worth
a
try
but
i
remember
this
being
better
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
than
in
the
bottle
drinkability
the
dominant
bitterness
and
mouth
coating
take
away
from
what
is
a
perplexingly
sweetsmelling
beer
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
balanced
and
tasty
with
a
nice
body
i
could
see
this
as
a
yearround
brew
though
the
spiciness
body
and
mild
warmth
do
make
this
an
appropriate
autumnhalloween
beer
ushering
in
the
cold
months
ahead
had
this
on
tap
at
the
marriott
hotel
in
south
portland
maine
it
poured
a
golden
brown
slightly
cloudy
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
good
even
lacing
throughout
it
has
a
nice
but
subtle
maltbrown
sugar
aroma
with
spicey
hints
although
this
is
not
supposed
to
be
anything
to
do
with
pumpkin
i
still
get
a
bitter
pumpkin
spice
taste
mixed
with
a
little
citrus
hop
and
malt
this
is
very
crisply
carbonated
and
brings
a
black
pepper
taste
there
is
a
dry
breadiness
at
the
finish
its
good
for
drinking
a
few
i
think
but
the
spice
may
limit
going
too
far
into
sessioning
this
nice
holiday
offering
probably
my
favorite
grittys
so
far
very
solid
and
recommended
for
a
try
a
nice
beer
that
has
2
gears
i
liked
the
shift
from
initial
taste
to
palate
but
didnt
particularly
care
for
what
transpired
after
that
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
just
not
particularly
good
simple
pub
fare
like
burgers
deli
sandwiches
etc
are
the
rule
here
or
maybe
some
nice
cheddar
id
certainly
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
stock
up
on
it
just
like
the
holiday
its
named
after
its
definitely
fun
once
a
year
check
out
the
22oz
bottles
before
like
a
ghost
they
disappear
cool
idea
and
very
drinkable
brew
cheers
a
darker
amber
pours
out
from
this
one
balanced
smells
of
spice
and
cinnamon
without
an
explicit
pumpkin
ideal
the
taste
is
fuller
than
most
halloweenpumpkin
ales
i
have
had
so
far
this
season
a
great
crisp
aftertaste
also
fills
your
mouth
with
every
sip
not
sure
how
a
general
audience
would
enjoy
the
seasonal
flavor
but
i
think
its
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
for
the
halloween
atmosphere
all
things
considered
a
good
but
but
a
bit
too
dry
a
very
nice
esb
probably
the
best
i
had
this
side
of
the
atlantic
love
the
beer
somehow
i
also
get
a
hint
of
pumpkin
or
pumpkin
spice
in
it
but
dont
know
if
that
is
really
coming
from
the
power
of
suggestion
since
it
is
a
halloween
ale
or
if
it
is
something
actually
coming
off
of
the
ringwood
yeast
either
way
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
poured
a
deep
rich
amber
with
a
tinge
of
crimson
head
was
thick
but
faded
quickly
sweet
caramel
and
doughy
malt
notes
mix
with
hints
of
herbals
up
front
hop
bitterness
coats
the
mouth
then
fades
into
a
dab
of
toffee
malt
flavor
overall
pretty
easy
drinking
a
real
session
beer
not
sure
i
get
the
halloween
theme
overall
a
definite
session
beer
very
flavorful
this
goes
down
very
easily
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
ample
head
aroma
is
nice
and
bitter
with
some
maltiness
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
bitter
to
an
extent
the
hops
show
through
well
in
this
brew
and
leave
a
nice
dry
feeling
at
the
back
of
the
throat
its
basically
a
very
smooth
beer
that
has
the
trappings
of
an
esb
very
drinkable
im
impressed
by
this
beer
for
sure
pours
a
medium
amber
hue
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
that
lasts
throughout
lacing
is
almost
nonexistant
smell
is
of
sweet
autumn
spices
with
caramel
malt
and
some
nutty
undertones
some
earthy
hops
emerge
on
the
nose
as
well
taste
seems
to
have
a
good
hop
bite
in
the
beginning
after
that
a
butterynut
flavor
emerges
with
a
very
smooth
caramel
aftertaste
that
lingers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
feel
to
it
not
your

poured
into
a

glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
deal
of
lacing
the
smell
is
fairly
sweet
and
malty
some
caramel
flavors
but
overall
and
am
usually
not
too
impressed
however
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
smells
of
light
roasted
malts
a
dense
head
was
quickly
formed
on
top
of
the
swirling
orangey
colored
contents
of
this
bottle
the
head
was
not
terribly
longlived
fresh
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
nay
i
say
desert
dry
and
the
hops
stick
on
your
buds
to
the
very
end
mildly
carbonated
with
a
mediumish
body
very
nice
and
drinkable
thanks
to
bennybrew
for
this
taste
of
the
east
coast
beg
anyone
you
know
going
through
maine
to
stop
and
get
you
some
of
this
this
beer
poured
a
clear
red
chestnut
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
fruity
and
malty
the
taste
was
also
fruity
and
malty
with
a
good
mild
hoppiness
throughout
this
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
was
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
this
sample
from
tap
was
much
superior
to
the
bottled
version
that
i
had
tasted
previously
a
nicely
drinkable
ale
this
poured
a
deep
reddish
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
and
lacing
a
sweet
malty
smell
and
taste
with
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
and
floral
hop
character
to
my
tastes
this
beer
got
better
as
it
warmed
as
it
helped
smooth
some
of
the
upfront
bite
maybe
thats
why
this
is
a
halloween
brew
seems
scary
at
first
but
not
so
bad
afterall
and
quite
drinkable
so
before
i
finished
the
first
one
i
grabbed
another
bottle
from
frig
and
cracked
it
open
it
worked

my

could
have
been

but
the
fusel

and
chemical
notes
ruin
it
for
me
a
good
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
up
front
an
interesting
blend
of
butterscotch
apples
raisins
a
healthy
dose
of
bitterness
moves
in
leads
to
a
finish
that
dries
out
nicely
and
leaves
a
touch
of
floral
hops
to
linger

bodied

quite
drinkable

a

with

i
picked
up
on
a

harshness
that
even
its

butterscotchlike

could
not
mask
from
using

to
johnny
p
for
the
halloween
treat
straight
4s
on
this
offeringhad
this
first
at
a
restaurant
in

and
found
it
very
appetizing
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
light
rocky
headaroma
is
caramelly
and
fruitythe
flavor
of
this
beer
is
alot
like
a
marzen
it
made
me
wonder
about
the
style
a
sweet
malty
brew
with
strong
hints
of
caramel
and
lightly
bready
with
very
little
bittering
a
real
good
beer
but
is
it
an
esb
an
okotoberfest
feel
to
it
but
its
a
bit
stronger
esb
i
would
recommend
this
beer
no
problem
full
of
character
a
very
hearty
well
balanced
esb
a
bit
on
the
heavier
side
full
bodied
and
more
robust
definitely
a
great
beer
i
absolutely
love
grittys
so
you
can
either
see
this
as
biased
or
simply
an
affirmation
of
my
faith
from
the
dark
rubymahogany
body
to
the
fine
silky
head
its
just
plain
beautiful
the
nuttymolases
taste
characteristic
of
most
of
grittys
beers
is
there
as
expected
this
time
with
its
bitter
yet
welcomed
guest
señor
aftertaste
this
is
a
fine
addition
to
the
mcduff
household
and
a
beer
that
ill
put
on
my
list
of
seasonal
musthaves
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
could
have
a
lot
of
dont
be
fooloed
by
the
halloween
name
of
pumpkin
colors
on
the
bottle
this
is
not
a
pumpkin
ale
a
blend
of
amber
pale
and
a
touch
of
scotch
ale
clear
deep
mahogony

nicely
structured

finishes
with
a

bitterness
towards
the

of
the
throat
nice
little
alcohol
warmth
afterwards
overall
a
fine
complex
brew
from
maine
really
overall
a
very
nice
tank
conditioned
brew
that
is
well
worth
your
time
the
bottle
has
great
artwork
with
the
grittys
bartender
handing
his
own
head
across
the
bar
with
bats
and
halloween
colors
fancy
labels
tend
to
make
me
suspect
the
beer
isnt
that
good
and
this
is
how
they
have
to
market
it
to
sell
any
i
am
wrong
in
this
case
very
good
brew
right
up
there
with
the
black
fly
stout
as
the
best
grittys
products
this
beer
comes
with
a
great
halloween
theme
label
with
headless
man
and
lots
of
bats
it
pours
halloween
orange
with
a
nice
tan
foam
earthy
hops
a
little
sugary
malt
and
a
touch
of
fruit
cherry
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
malty
and
grainy
with
a
toasted
malt
finish
at
the
first
half
glass
with
the
mellow
bitterness
coming
out
much
later
as
the
glass
empties
the
texture
is
mediumlight
and
the
esb
flavors
are
there
but
the
hops
are
a
bit
muted
in
this
bottle
it
definitely
grew
on
me
over
the
whole
bottle
thanks
to
bierman9
for
some
tastes
of
the
upper
northeast
intrigued
by
the
name
i
had
to
purchase
this
beer
it
poured
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
faint
hoppy
smell
the
taste
consists
of
a
pale
dry
bitterness
spiked
with
portions
of
spiced
pumpkin
fortunately
grittys
does
not
go
overboard
on
the
pumpkin
flavor
as
it
stays
low
key
throughout
the
session
hoppiness
is
prevalent
and
i
would
say
that
this
brew
is
fairly
comparable
to
an
octoberfest
overall
this
was
a
pleasurable
experience
overall
a
nice
ale
i
personally
would
like
a
little
more
complexity
but
it
is
still
very
drinkable
i
was
a
bit
mislead
when
buying
this
while
on
vacation
in
maine
i
was
told
it
was
like
a
pumpkinspiced
seasonal
brew
it
pours
a
nice
creamy
thick
white
head
which
slowly
disappears
the
color
is
a
caramel
dark
amber
it
offers
a
bitter
hoppy
smell
with
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
right
upon
tasting
i
realize
how
strong
and
thick
it
is
its
definately
bitter
but
thick
and
very
malty
with
a
wheat
overtone
upon
swallowing
i
find
that
after
finishing
one
or
maybe
two
of
these
they
will
leave
you
gasping
with
thirst
it
is
somewhat
smooth
and
offers
some
bite
of
alcohol
when
swallowing
not
a
bad
brew
i
probally
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
pours
a
clear
mahogany
body
topped
by
a
frothy
ivory
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
lightly
roasty
and
caramel
tinged
malt
with
some
herbal
and
mildly
spicy
character
that
does
not
appear
to
be
from
hops
but
might
be
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
thats
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
complex
with
a
sweet
applelike
fruitiness
that
later
combines
with
the
spiciness
to
really
tie
this
beer
together
and
make
it
interesting
a
rich
honeyish
lightly
buttery
and
softly
carameltinged
maltiness
what
appears
to
be
nutmeg
and
a
spicy
bitterness
that
allows
the
flavors
to
come
through
before
appearing
more
solidly
in
the
long
lasting
finish
very
nicely
done
exceptionally
well
balanced
really
full
of
flavor
and
character
for
a
beer
with
such
a
light
body
and
im
guessing
median
alcohol
content
definitely
worth
trying
one
of
the
tastier
seasonal
brews
this
year
the
deep
color
is
topped
with
a
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
the
lightly
malty
taste
is
well
supported
by
a
good
body
and
a
hint
of
autumn
spice
very
tasty
cheers

and
for
handing

really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
full

but
not
overwhelming
i
did
not
leave
you
with
a
full
feeling
the
spices
seemed
to
blend
in
harmony
like
a
good
pumpkin
pie
a
delight
a
masterful
brew
that
is
not
only
a
great
rendition
of
the
esb
style
but
a
perfect
change
up
from
the
onslaught
of
oktoberfest
beers
during
the
fall
notes
once
you
get
over
the
sameness
of
and
get
to
like
the
ringwood
aka
shipyard
yeast
strain
in
many
of
the
new
england
beers
youll
find
the
most
interesting
and
unique
flavours
this
is
no
exception
a
wonderful
esb
and
a
masterful
seasonal
drink
up
happy
halloween

front
quickly
followed
by
dark
malt
with
chocolate
notes
earthy
floral
hop
flavors
emerge
through
the
middle
to
the
end
with
buttery
and
toasted
malt
character
finished
crisp
and
dry
with
light
hop
bitterness
this
was
excellent
it
reminded
me
how
much
i
enjoy
this
style
o
the
first
couple
of
sips
were
pretty
good
but
it
became
pretty
uninteresting
pretty
quickly
i
much
prefer
the
regular
esb
that
said
its
still
not
a
bad
beer
o
a
good
robust
esb
for
the
winter
months
the
ringwood
yeast
makes
most
of
grittys
beers
taste
alike
and
this
one
is
no
different
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
brewery
or
ringwood
yeast
this
has
a
hoppy
malty
mix
dark
brown
and
foaming
in
color
it
has
a
robust
fullbodiedness
that
sits
nicely
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
faint
hoppy
aroma
it
is
rich
but
mild
for
a
christmas
beer
it
is
almost
a
whisper
of
a
christmas
beer
this
is
probably
a
good
christmas
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
christmas
beers
pretty
robust
beer
i
forgot
this
was
an
esb
a
really
big
esb
at
that
prickly
carbonation
nice
pale
and
caramel
malts
big
nice
caramel
malts
toffee
sugared
biscuit
balanced
by
big
earthy
hop
presence
a
really
great
brew
o
a
good
beer
overall
not
a
huge
grittys
fan
but
this
one
is
pretty
darn
good
would
recommend
o
this
is
close
to
a
tie
the
heavy
seas
looked
prettier
and
smelled
nicer
but
this
beer
had
a
comparable
taste
and
a
slightly
better
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
plus
a
good
value
overall
really
like
this
grittys
offering
now
the
hard
part
halloween
ale
or
christmas
ale
better
yet
keep
6
of
each
on
hand
overall
pretty
good
marketed
as
a
winter
warmer
but
definitely
feels
esb
like
mentioned
here
on
ba
it
all
makes
sense
now
and
feels
alright
o
average
for
the
style
but
acutally
i
liked
it
and
went
nicely
with
some
christmas
cookies
o
when
i
first
started
drinking
beer
this
was
my
favorite
while
not
a
great
beer
the
sentimental
value
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
the
holiday
season
nowadays
o
good
to
the
style
of
esb
not
your
typical
christmas
or
holiday
ale
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
away
from
normal
spiced
up
holiday
ales
thought
for
sure
this
beer
would
have
been
much
better
the
whole
idea
of
the
christmas
beers
is
to
have
all
these
spicy
rich
flavors
mixed
with
some
fruits
and
alcohol
all
together
for
one
big
bang
of
flavors
i
ha
this
one
as
my
opened
on
1411
and
to
be
honest
i
wasnt
sure
that
i
believed
i
got
the
right
beer
i
asked
the
bar
tender
about
it
and
they
assured
me
it
was
the
right
one
the
color
was
a
nice
reddish
tone
that
works
for
me
the
smell
was
a
little
spicy
but
nothing
at
all
strong
and
the
flavor
was
just
not
there
rather
upsetting
d
i
could
drink
a
few
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
db
not
bad
a
bit
different
from
what
i
am
used
to
for
the
style
bust
still
within
the
boundaries
for
the
most
part
the
taste
has
a
toasty
malts
and
some
biscuit
along
with
a
smooth
vanilla
buttery
flavor
it
finishes
with
a
smooth
bitterness
some
good
hop
balance
with
a
robust
base
drinkability
i
can
see
having
23
of
these
in
a
session
but
certainly
not
the
whole
sixer
this
is
another
solid
brew
from
grittys
reminds
me
a
bit
of
their
halloween
ale
but
its
different
enough
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
might
pick
up
another
sixer
dthis
is
an
exceptionaly
drinkable
beer
and
while
not
the
most
complex
thing
on
the
shelf
is
charming
in
its
quality
and
its
drinkability
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
their
halloween
ale
although
i
think
this
may
be
a
tad
bit
smoother
poured
from
bottle
with
freshness
date
nov
2010
into
tulip
glass
chestnut
copper
color
opaque
at
top
and
clears
towards
the
bottom
sweet
caramel
smell
but
not
too
strong
bready
caramel
flavor
with
hints
of
raisin
unique
for
christmas
ales
in
that
its
not
really
spicy
crisp
dry
feel
easily
drinkable
espeicially
for
christmas
ales
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
reddish
highlights
with
a
small
thick
head
that
slowly
goes
into
a
film
with
very
good
lacing
buttery
toffee
aroma
slight
malty
sweetness
mixed
with
a
little
citrus
with
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
finish
really
enjoyed
this
brew
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
there
was
only
a
trace
of
foam
laying
across
the
top
of
the
beer
when
it
was
brought
to
me
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
and
ruby
highlights
nose
was
much
spicier
than
i
anticipated
i
liked
the
intermingling
of
the
cinnamon
with
some
sort
of
mint
spearmint
perhaps
definitely
not
peppermint
mouthfeel
was
full
with
a
taste
like
a
chocolate
candy
cane
maybe
i
was
wrong
about
it
not
being
peppermint
it
had
a
minty
flavor
on
the
tongue
at
any
rate
finish
had
a
breathtakingly
minty
quality
damn
was
this
tasty
do
they
bottle
this
one
or
better
yet
put
it
in
a
can
very
refreshing
in
a
minty
sort
of
way
a
dark
mahogany
color
relatively
clear
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
and
little
sign
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
deep
malt
and
light
peach
hops
and
juniper
the
flavor
brings
malty
licorice
evergreen
slightly
resinous
but
generally
on
the
light
side
and
fairly
drinkable
the
hop
goodness
is
sweet
and
theres
a
bready
barleymalt
base
with
a
touch
of
licorice
though
slightly
different
from
the
bottle
version
still
a
very
solid
holiday
brew
d
d
pleasant
easy
to
drink
a
nice
example
of
an
american
esb
theres
a
tug
of
war
between
the
tealike
hoppiness
and
the
sweet
malt
last
time
i
had
this
it
was
perfectly
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
good
butter
flavor
from
the
ringwood
yeast
biscuity
malt
flavor
but
it
seems
that
the
ringwood
yeast
in
this
bottle
dominates
too
much
and
the
balance
of
the
previous
bottle
i
had
has
been
lost
this
is
one
of
the
december
craft
beers
of
the
month
at
west
on
centre
a
local
restaurant
in
west
roxbury
served
in
the
bottle
and
poured
into
a
pilsner
style
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
smelled
of
cinnamon
and
pine
trees
taste
was
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
nutmeg
brown
sugar
and
other
christmas
spices
much
heartier
mouthfeel
than
other
xmas
ales
on
the
market
due
to
its
rich
body
and
robust
flavor
it
may
not
be
the
best
beer
to
pair
with
dinner
more
of
a
dessert
beer
a
great
cold
weather
holiday
brew
i
just
wish
i
could
find
more
of
it
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
just
right
got
this
time
of
year
it
has
a
bit
more
of
a
body
than
a
fall
of
summer
beer
its
something
to
have
during
the
holiday
season
that
is
a
bit
more
filling
but
drinks
really
well
it
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
for
the
amount
of
bitterness
i
have
had
more
unique
winter
ales
but
this
one
has
a
strong
sense
of
completion
and
flavor
character
which
is
memorable
a
really
nice
beer
heavy
on
the
caramel
for
an
esb
but
the
hops
provide
a
nice
balance
not
sure
if
i
love
the
dark
fruits
presumably
from
high
lovibond
crystal
but
overall
a
solid
beer
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
november
2010
sampled
on
december

2009
the
pour
is
an
attractive
ruby
red
with
excellent
clarity
and
ab
out
a
quarter
inch
light
tan
head
that
fizzles
after
a
couple
moments
the
aroma
is
moderately
hopped
with
a
variety
of
bitter
scents
along
with
caramel
malts
a
mouthfeel
that
can
be
characterized
as
medium
to
heavy
and
maybe
a
tad
creamy
the
taste
is
more
like
a
stong
ale
and
less
like
a
spicy
christmas
ale
but
it
is
likeable
gritty
mcduffs
makes
a
decent
bitter
ale
and
this
is
a
slightly
more
pungent
variation
on
their
most
recognized
recipe

the

is
a

with
low
carbonation
and
a
finger
of

little
sweet
in
the
nose
malty
with

similar
on

sweet

a

a
sturdy
bitterness
flashes
of
alcohol
here
and
there
it
has
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
beer
is
a
nice
blend
of
esb
and
winter
warmer
characteristics
that
while
not
a
quaffer
is
definitely
not
a
sipper
either
a
tasty
winter
ale
a
little
round
in
the
mouth
balanced
by
a
wheatlike
taste
and
some
crispness
in
the
carbonation
finishes
pretty
well
again
like
an
ipa
with
winter
spices
hard
to
argue
with
a
few
of
these
this
is
definitely
one
of
grittys
best
offerings
similar
to
the
halloween
ale
but
better
with
a
different
hop
profile
and
more
maltiness
i
think
i
prefer
the
halloween
ale
a
bit
more
even
though
they
are
quite
similar
so
if
you
enjoyed
that
beer
from
grittys
then
youll
definitely
enjoy
this
one
as
well
pours
a
deep
amberred
with
nary
a
head
to
be
found
carbonation
is
very
subdued
malty
aroma
with
little
hops
detected
taste
is
on
the
malty
side
hops
are
way
in
the
background
a
somewhat
cloying
sweetness
diacetyl
seems
a
little
out
of
control
resulting
in
a
butterscotch
aftertaste
i
dont
really
care
much
for
this
beer
and
would
not
purchase
it
again
served
ontap
at
the
great
lost
bear
in
portland
maine
the
beer
is
a
clear
brown
color
with
hints
of
ruby
almost
no
head
just
a
skim
of
bubbles
on
top
the
aroma
isnt
anything
significant
just
some
maltiness
and
a
few
spices
but
nothing
strong
enough
to
identify
the
flavor
is
driven
by
the
malts
it
has
a
molasses
sweetness
present
throughout
there
are
some
bitter
spices
the
make
their
way
forward
in
the
flavor
near
the
end
although
they
are
present
as
soon
as
you
taste
the
beer
they
arent
as
strong
there
is
a
crisp
clarity
to
the
flavor
that
also
has
some
esters
it
has
a
fairly
light
body
and
maybe
a
slightly
above
medium
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
you
could
grow
tired
of
i
feel
that
the
grittys
christmas
is
a
pretty
unique
winter
beer
in
the
portland
microbrew
landscape
it
isnt
strong
like
the
shipyard
prelude
or
gearys
hsa
nor
is
it
full
of
winter
spices
like
the
gearys
and
shipyards
standard
winter
ales
and
for
that
it
is
a
recommendable
session
beer
for
those
cold
maine
nights
cheers
i
was
absolutely
blown
away
by
this
seasonal
having
it
off
cask
it
was
an
awesome
experience
a
total
flavor
explosion
that
cannot
be
recreated
via
a
bottle
from
a
6
pack
although
still
delicious
when
i
say
it
smelled
like
a
bouquet
of
flowers
dammit
im
telling
you
it
did
always
a
huge
fan
of
this
grittys
seasonal
and
probably
my
favorite
with
the
halloween
ale
a
close
2nd
md
overall
not
a
bad
beer
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
in
the
spice
department
something
more
holiday
like
i
guess
this
is
winter
warmer
meets
esb
robustly
bitter
at
the
end
with
hints
of
the
spice
of
a
winter
warmer
initial
hit
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
predominating
the
taste
in
the
middle
then
the
bitters
kick
in
like
a
good
esb
thanks
donkeyrunner
off
the
tap
this
one
was
a
deep
garnet
color
with
a
light
beigeoff
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
of
the
collar
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
dry
roasted
malt
and
sweet
malt
with
some
general
hops
the
flavors
were
similar
lots
of
caramel
malt
and
roasted
malt
with
a
bitter
hops
finish
rather
standard
but
pleasant
enough
my
main
complaint
was
it
had
nothing
particularly
christmaslike
about
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
for
the
style
the
carbonation
was
good
and
the
body
mediumfull
drinkability
a
decently
filling
and
warming
beer
for
winter
but
one
that
definitely
allows
for
a
second
pint
not
a
bad
esb
overall
the
biggest
flaw
is
the
hop
flavors
for
the
most
part
the
citrus
flavors
are
watery
and
overshadow
some
of
the
very
pleasantly
dry
rich
malt
flavors
i
would
order
another
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
esb
enjoyable
drinkability
very
good
i
usually
dont
like
winter
ales
but
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
pretty
complex
and
smooth
a
beer
worth
drinking
in
multiples
heck
yes
my
girlfriend
got
this
for
me
along
with
some
other
random
singles
and
i
probably
never
wouldve
ever
bought
this
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
is
extremely
sessionable
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
candied
warmer
to
drink
a
few
of
reach
for
this
very
nice
deep
bronze
color
fairly
decent
aromamalty
with
a
slight
metallic
odor
solid
malt
flavor
with
an
adequete
hop
bite
somewhat
fruity
still
with
the
metallic
twinge
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
decent
enough
body
slightly
creamy
and
fairly
smooth
really
a
notch
above
average
overall
poured
like
a
root
beer
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
was
very
faint
taste
has
maybe
some
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
with
some
graininess
and
a
faint
metallic
twang
to
it
a
little
thinner
bodied
than
i
expected
not
my
first
choice
for
a
warmer
but
worth
a
shot
this
beer
poured
a
deep
chestnut
with
some
ruby
highlights
to
it
the
is
clear
throughout
with
a
fine
thin
head
there
is
a
slight
reminent
of
lacing
nose
has
a
touch
of
caramellike
malt
and
spices
but
hops
are
more
prevalent
flavor
has
some
caramel
aspects
hops
and
spices
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
mouthfeel
was
great
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
the
beer
is
a
bit
creamier
than
crisp
but
the
traditional
malts
blend
nicely
with
some
spiceness
there
is
a
good
amount
of
caramel
butterscotch
some
spices
perhaps
in
the
allspice
family
some
drying
hop
presence
towards
the
finish
the
beer
is
a
traditional
interpretation
of
an
english
esb
with
a
nice
efforvesence
in
the
mouthfeel
a
nice
drying
finish
slightly
bittering
hops
coupled
with
the
nice
buttery
diacetyl
a
nice
find
lchaim
good
drinkable
beer
this
is
another
interesting
christmas
ale
and
a
very
enjoyable
esb
its
also
my
first
offering
from
gritty
and
ill
definitely
be
trying
to
find
some
others
d
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
above
average
in
all
categories
and
slightly
unique
in
terms
of
typical
winter
beers
highly
drinkable
and
still
sessionable
at

abv
i
had
never
heard
of
this
beer
or
brewery
prior
to
receiving
this
as
part
of
a
recent
sepa
case
split
but
am
highly
impressed
with
my
introduction
to
gritty
mcduff
d
it
went
down
pretty
easy
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
hue
with
a
thick
two
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
takes
a
while
to
die
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
a
fair
amount
of
sticky
lacing
remains
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
nice
looking
beer
for
sure
typical
esb
smell
with
some
butter
caramel
malts
and
floral
hops
a
sweet
nutty
aroma
with
a
good
amount
of
earth
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
starts
with
some
spicy
hops
toffee
and
tart
apples
midway
some
roasted
malts
and
biscuits
emerge
aftertaste
is
slightly
metallic
with
some
gritty
hops
and
a
sweet
nutty
flavor
medium
body
with
a
creamy
feel
and
a
stronger
than
needed
carbonation
a
nice
drinking
esb
but
i
do
prefer
the
halloween
ale
to
this
d
pretty
drinkable
as
the
malt
mixing
is
really
nice
d
i
was
hoping
for
a
touch
more
hoppiness
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
the
lively
mouthfeel
more
than
made
up
for
it
enjoyable
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
toasted
malt
caramel
nuts
hops
and
yeast
the
appearance
is
amber
brown
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
and
slightly
watery
the
flavor
is
decent
but
not
great
the
palate
is
smooth
from
the
carbonation
but
too
thin
overall
i
am
not
that
crazy
about
it
but
i
can
drink
it
more
drinkable
than
most
holiday
brews
due
to
subtlty
of
xmas
spices
good
beer
d
good
for
a
try
at
best
as
with
most
xmas
beers
but
not
one
you
want
to
continually
drink
a
fair
and
good
drink
overall
with
its
warm
and
toned
down
nature
lets
you
enjoy
this
without
being
assaulted
by
a
barrage
of
spices
that
distracts
from
the
flavor
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
a
pretty
good
esb
if
youve
tried
the
halloween
beer
this
one
is
very
similar
to
it
i
liked
this
one
better
though
pours
a
reddish
brown
in
color
small
light
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
faint
smell
mostly
of
roasted
malt
and
touch
of
caramel
crisp
and
dry
tasting
on
the
palate
with
a
roasted
malt
and
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
easy
to
drink
and
a
enjoyable
christmas
ale
this
a
beautiful
beer
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
nice
head
to
it
taste
is
somehow
subtle
yet
present
all
the
way
through
the
drinking
in
a
good
way
no
overly
abundant
tastes
that
stand
out
but
juts
lots
of
hops
and
malts
shining
through
making
for
a
great
tasting
beer
a
unique
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
out
super
drinkable
rich
very
thick
creamy
and
fullbodied
mouthfeel
however
drinkability
took
a
slight
hit
due
to
the
presence
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
drinkability
nothing
bad
but
i
could
definitely
stand
a
bit
more
more
of
everything
even
if
i
get
my
ass
thrown
onto
santas
naughty
list
i
just
had
to
speak
my
mind
about
it
perhaps
the
oil
crunch
is
hitting
us
even
jolly
old
saint
nick
in
ways
we
never
could
have
imagined
but
i
have
a
sneaky
suspicion
hes
holding
back
beeaye
2800
gritty
mcduffs
halloween
ale
is
good
and
gritty
mcduffs
christmas
ale
is
equally
tasty
two
beers
probably
arent
enough
for
a
sweeping
generalization
to
be
made
but
this
brewery
appears
to
be
solid
id
love
to
see
what
else
they
can
do
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
think
i
am
into
esb
beers
interesting
spice
taste
to
it
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
amber
color
voluminous
offwhite
head
settled
to
a
quarter
inch
and
ending
in
a
thin
layer
of
foam
sticky
lacing
adhered
to
side
of
glass
during
the
tasting
scent
of
hops
and
something
sweet
i
would
have
to
reiterate
the
burnt
toffee
described
in
previous
reviews
taste
similar
to
nose
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
carbonation
but
also
a
smooth
fullbodied
feeling
i
really
like
this
offering
from
grittys
and
would
definitely
consider
this
an
excellent
seasonal
session
brew
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
burnt
toffee
scent
along
with
a
light
hop
aroma
its
dry
with
a
nice
roasted
character
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
element
this
seems
a
bit
malty
for
a
bitter
but
it
tastes
good
there
is
a
roasted
malt
element
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
and
a
fine
seasonal
but
a
marginal
esb
at
that
the
taste
is
toffeeish
with
an
earthy
minty
hop
background
near
fullbodied
it
is
a
tasty
wellbalanced
very
easy
drinking
ale
the
alcohol
is
just
enough
to
give
it
a
nice
warming
touch
without
interfering
in
the
taste
or
drinkability
drinkability
nice
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
day
that
isnt
an
alcohol
bomb
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
and
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
not
the
most
full
flavored
esb
but
it
seems
to
be
well
balanced
with
a
nice
assortment
of
hearty
festive
flavors
for
the
holidays
plus
it
drinks
pretty
well
ive
been
impressed
with
the
few
offerings
that
ive
tried
from
gritty
mcduffs
their
halloween
ale
renewed
my
interest
in
esbs
and
prompted
my
renewed
interest
in
balance
over
extreme
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
winter
warmers
im
very
pleased
to
see
them
stick
with
the
esb
style
that
they
do
so
well
pours
a
bright
cherrymahogany
brown
with
a
goodsized
head
that
fades
to
almost
nothing
quite
quickly
the
nose
is
sweet
nickel
caramel
malts
and
a
light
seemingly
ringwood
note
on
the
palate
dry
malts
play
with
sour
english
ale
notes
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
bitterness
roasted
malts
in
the
back
hops
come
out
toward
the
end
but
never
achieve
any
really
juicy
tasty
volume
levels
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
acidic
in
a
good
way
but
the
malts
are
not
fleshed
out
very
well
and
the
carbonation
is
just
medium
which
in
this
case
seems
either
too
weak
or
too
strong
but
not
just
right
overall
this
is
an
inoffensive
beer
but
also
a
very
mediocre
one
drinkability
obviously
this
was
a
loser
but
for
the
head
a
total
yawn
fest
if
im
offered
one
gratis
ill
review
this
one
again
but
cmon
gritty
you
can
do
much
better
than
this
overall
the
beer
was
decent
it
is
a
good
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
in
little
pats
pizza
in
orono
maine
on
tap
there
are
no
flaws
in
this
beer
yet
i
believe
that
it
is
not
anything
more
than
middle
of
the
road
i
can
enjoy
it
but
am
not
overjoyed
by
it
steve
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
had
a
feeling
this
was
going
to
taste
a
lot
like
their
halloween
ale
but
while
there
are
some
similarities
its
not
close
to
it
as
i
thought
it
would
be
this
is
a
good
hearty
winter
seasonal
thats
worth
drinking
for
while
drinkability
likely
sticking
to
one
of
these
grittys
seems
to
be
fairly
consistent
with
esbs
with
which
my
tasting
experience
is
limited
pours
a
dark
rubyred
color
with
a
onefinger
head
aroma
is
kind
of
spicy
with
a
subtle
bitterness
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
bitter
with
some
spiciness
upfront
and
fades
to
a
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
second
sip
confirms
many
of
the
same
characteristics
it
is
definitely
a
bitter
but
for
some
reason
i
cant
really
taste
much
beyond
a
decent
drinkable
bitter
that
goes
well
on
a
cold
winter
night
not
bad
overall
this
is
an
esb
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
to
it
but
is
still
fairly
tame
and
simple
overall
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
delicious
brew
one
i
highly
recomend
overall
the
2007
batch
just
hit
the
stores
not
bad
ill
be
drinking
this
on
tap
from
the
brewpub
when
i
go
up
to
portland
d
cant
ask
for
any
better
from
an
esb
for
drinkability
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
note
this
beer
seems
more
belgian
dubbel
in
style
to
me
than
esb
mabye
they
change
the
recipe
from
year
to
year
i
will
have
to
do
some
investigating
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
into
this
style
but
it
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
tonight
i
would
probably
pass
if
i
came
across
it
again
leftover
christmas
beer
from
jesss
market
here
in
town
pours
quite
dark
brown
smells
a
bit
nutty
but
not
very
strong
tastes
like
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
nutty
flavor
and
finishes
a
little
bitter
but
all
very
well
balanced
a
pretty
decent
beer
if
i
can
find
more
which
i
probably
can
ill
get
more
notes
if
you
like
esbs
or
english
brown
ales
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
its
not
extreme
in
any
way
or
terribly
unique
but
its
a
decently
balanced
malty
beer
that
is
pretty
drinkable
it
seemed
to
go
very
well
with
smoked
cheddar
cheese
thick
and
syrupy
feels
like
a
liqueur
or
nonbeer
too
sweet
to
have
too
many
of
these
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
yesterday
and
decided
id
try
it
on
tap
at
coles
to
see
what
its
like
fresh
and
as
intended
before
opening
a
bottle
the
pint

to
the
hops
also

no

i

of

there
are
others
that
are
better
but
the
distribution
here
in
the
u

is
pretty
thin
at
the
moment
this
is
one
of
the
best
available
from
my
perspective

also
makes
an
appearance
just
delicious
rjt
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
to
date
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
english
bitters
generally
i
find
english
bitters
way
overpriced
and
pretty
boring
but
this
one
is
full
on
flavour
and
a
very
decent
price
an
equivalent
price
of
24
x
330ml
case
for
au55
2014
is
almost
unheard
of
for
something
this
good
surely
this
must
be
an
introductory
price
as
this
is
a
new
ale
to
queensland
i
will
likely
pick
up
a
couple
more
soon

of
how
great

can

time
the
nose
was
indeed
quite
malty
and
fruity
and
the
descriptor
of
fruitcake
definitely
applied
to
both
myself
and
the
beer
the
order
to
release
batteries
was
given
and
the
ship
rocked
sideways
in
the
water
as
i
hefted
the
glass
to
my
lips
and
let
fly
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
semisweet
at
most
with
the
malt
having
done
its
thing
and
the
yeast
having
had
a
field
day
the
taste
was
very
biscuity
and
fruity
and
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
fruitcake
deelish
in
the
meantime
we
had
the
bloody
dutch
on
their
heels
our
doublecrackd
cannons
left
those
clogwearing
punks
on
their
heels
and
they
had
no
choice
but
to
tack
away
and
northward
from
whence
they
came
one
of
our
lads
incurred
a
splinter
which
will
almost
assuredly
cost
him
his
arm
though
the
finish
was
fittingly
dry
and
as
we
headed
for
safe
harbour
i
toasted
our
brave
lads
in
a
job
well
done
overall
a
very
good
but
not
outstanding
beer
i
would
not
consider
this
beer
sessionable
as
it
is
quite
filling
it
would
be
best
served
as
a
dessert
beer
or
paired
with
proper
food
such
as
strong
cheese
or
roast
beef
smells
fantastic
and
like
the
bottle
says
of
fruitcake
with
no
real
hop
aroma
to
speak
off
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
reasonably
quickly
and
is
a
dark
rich
brown
with
a
tinge
of
red
to
it
nice
and
malty
with
a
lingering
bitterness
overall
a
very
nice
drop
oh
my
as
advertised
ruby
with
a
tan
head
and
smells
like
a
stinkin
fruitcake
well
if
we
here
in
america
dont
like
fruitcakes
what
makes
em
think
we
wanna
drink
something
that
tastes
like
a
fruitcake
the
cool
thing
is
they
did
not
add
the
flavors
i
think
but
rather
it
comes
from
the
malts
they
use
which
is
forgivable
original
and
almost
commendable
cherry
fig
sticky
sugary
lickable
fruitiness
on
the
nose
and
palate
leave
it
to
the
brits
kind
of
wish
i
had
opened
the
mango

instead
of
this
one
now
typical
british
tangy
malts
sweet
yet
bitter
fruity
and
rich

metallic
aftertaste
all
in
all

although
quite
filling
ale
could
be
better
but
it
could
be
much
worse
served
at
hunger
thirst
in
lancaster
pa
this
was
an
excellent
presentation
of
a
classic
beer
very
pretty
dark

and
heady
in
the
glass
malty
but
not
sweet
also
caramel
flavors
but
not

very
well
balanced
i
almost
thought
i
was
drinking
a
heavy
lager
this
beer
was
so
smooth

a
nice
malty
mildly
grassy
hop
finish
medium
bodied
with
light
creaminess
a
tasty
esb
with
great
malt
and
nicely
balanced
hops
i
dont
know
this
gold
hop
variant
but
it
is
very
subtle
at
first
but
reveals
itself
nicely
in
the
finish
and
there
is
great
malt
support
for
it
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
and
will
buy
it
again
nicely
done
o
a
solid
bottled
esb
that
is
almost
certainly
superior
on
cask
served
up
this
lovely
fullpint
ale
in
a
pub
glass
the
color
is
an
intensely
clear
redbrown
with
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
light
tan
head
that
fades
away
quickly
the
nose
offers
up
caramel
malts
and
sweet
berry
notes
there
is
more
of
the
same
as
you
take
that
first
taste
although
these
flavors
quickly
fade
to
a
drying
moderate
bitterness
revealing
a
respectable
underlying
hoppiness
the
feel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
the
overall
result
is
a
decently
complex
nicely
enjoyable
semibitter
ale
absolutely
worth
trying

a
hefty
beer
with
great
flavor
o
this
is
a
nice
esb
with
plenty
of
aromas
and
flavors
running
around
in
it
it
is
a
bit
too
thick
and
chewy
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
than
one
but
its
a
nice
sipper
ive
not
had
fullers
esb
for
a
while
and
that
might
just
be
better
this
is
a
moreish
beer
id
definately
buy
again
i
am
selfconfessed
big
fan
of
the
esb
style
i
find
it
to
be
a
highly
underrated
style
with
balanced
and
i
dare
say
often
nuanced
flavor
profile
this
beer
presents
as
a
clear
rubytinged
brown
brew
with
an
offwhite

that
quickly
retreats
leaving
a
billowy
island
in
the
center
of
my
tulip
glass
i
utilize
for
evaluation
sweet
malts
very
subtle
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
breadiness
commands
me
to
take
a
sip
malt
sweetness
a
hint
of
hop
spice
and
candied
fruits
abound
in
the
palate
with
a
finish
a
touch
dryer
than
anticipated
medium
mouthfeel
no
obvious
flaws
and
the
desire
to
have
another
which
really
is
the
hallmark
of
a
good
beer
well
done
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
as
a
solid
session
ale
edit
26
mar
2014
im
wondering
now
if
this
cask
was
a
mislabeled
southwold
bitter
having
had
broadside
earlier
in
the
month
on
draft
it
tasted
quite
a
bit
different
than
what
ive
described
above
the
southwold
bottle
i
just
drank
was
much
more
similar
to
my
description
above
sweet
and
bitter
aftertaste
a
bit
dry
ogreat
all
around
beer
and
one
definitely
worth
trying
pours
an
rubybrown
a
really
nice
color
head
is
decent
at
pour
but
disappates
somewhat
quickly
somewhat
expected
with
this
style
of
beer
smell
is
bready
malt
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
good
for
this
traditional
english
beer
but
from
a
bottle
taste
is
like
a
english
bitter
but
with
a
deeper
depth
of
flavor
stronger
malts
some
mild
hoping
and
in
addition
to
the
notes
picked
up
on
aroma
the
taste
adds
a
bittersweet
finish
a
honey
or
a
nice
dark
sugar
good
beer
not
bad
i
dont
hate
this
and
the
brew
isnt
flawed
with
a
bad
decision
just
too
many
elements
as
rich
as
this
is
the
entire
fruit
basket
kinda
kills
this
even
with
the
bitter
at
the
end
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
esb
ive
had
beautiful
polished
amber
color
topped
with
fine
head
and
retention
on
top
the
nose
is
fruity
nutty
and
has
some
raw
malt
sweetness
that
leads
to
a
flavor
which
is
dominate
of
a
duet
of
malty
and
fruity
notes
accents
of
pineapple
work
into
the
profile
some
butterscotch
and
toffee
crisp
appear
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
a
little
raw
at
first
eventually
smoothing
out
to
become
more
pleasant
and
and
more
fun
to
drink
overall
its
a
fine
choice
to
drink
broadside
drinkability
a
very
good
brew
british
bitters
are
not
my
specialty
and
i
would
much
rather
have
it
from
the
cask
but
i
suppose
this
will
do
across
the
pond
sweet
grainy
flavors
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
some
light
fruitiness
apricot
and
melon
rind
notes
supple
feel
mellow
and
smooth
not
too
sweet
simple
but
well
put
together
and
enjoyable
overall
a
solid
esb
lives
up
to
its
benchmark
reputation
nothing
stands
out
in
this
beer
its
balanced
but
it
has
nothing
to
hang
its
hat
on
needs
some
spice
and
maybe
steer
it
back
towards
the
style
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
a
perfect
example
of
an
english
esb
with
true
to
style
flavors
and
a
time
tested
recipe
broadside
is
one
of
the
best
english
ales
that
comes
to
the
states
and
honestly
can
be
enjoyed
for
almost
any
occasion
top
notch
o
crazy
this
was
so
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
honestly
i
saw
the
labeling
about
worlds
best
brewery
so
i
assumed
it
wouldnt
be
great
but
it
is
this
for
me
constitutes
a
pretty
perfect
afternoon
drinking
beer
rich
but
not
heavy
with
a
good
kick
and
easily
quaffed
love
it
a
real
pleasant
beer
ive
been
wanting
this
for
awhile
and
glad
to
have
finally
tried
it
fantastic
o
it
was
great
to
revisit
this
legendary
effort
still
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
well
worth
the
4
for
a
pickup
glad
they
came
back
to
the
states
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
with
some
darker
malt
elements
theres
not
much
hop
in
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
is
short
lived
the
body
is
above
average
like
a
typical
british
ale
although
this
ale
is
a
bit
toastier
and
richer
in
malt
character
than
im
used
to
in
most
esbs
especially
my
benchmark
fullers
esb
this
beer
seems
of
a
stronger
mild
ale
or
a
hoppy
and
soft
brown
ale
of
england
overall
drinkability
i
suspect
the
simplicity
of
the
one
malt
one
hop
combination
here
would
really
stick
out
if
this
was
on
cask
dont
let
it
get
too
warm
though
gets
flat
and
a
little
too
sweet
towards
the
end
so
with
a
full
pint
i
think
one
is
enough
to
savor
and
call
it
done
worth
revisiting
though
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
malty
and
flavorful
for
the
style
note
labeled
as
5
1
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
mouthfeel
that
makes
the
beer
a
pleasure
to
drink
hops
add
a
nice
drying
finish
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
english
strong
ales
i
have
had
in
recently
memory
abv
is
well
masked
and
the
flavors
and
pleasant
bitter
finish
make
up
for
the
average
aromas
recommended
over
the
esb
from
adanams
both
are
good
but
not
revolutionary
but
that
is
not
their
purpose
cheers
its
a
decent
esb
but
something
isnt
quite
clicking
for
me
the
fruitiness
is
a
bit
too
all
over
the
place
and
the
sweetness
needs
a
creamier
mouthfeel
notes
tastes
as
much
like
a
strong
ale
as
an
esb
the
bitterness
while
not
overpowering
clearly
dominates
this
beer
it
is
a
satisfying
sipper
overall
fairly
nice
balanced
ale
a
rich
fruity
good
tasting
beer
well
balanced
no
surprises
i
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
plough
in
london
this
is
a
fairly
average
esb
it
has
a
decent
aroma
of
hops
and
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
light
tangy
taste
but
not
much
body
there
more
to
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
but
it
was
also
served
pretty
cold
it
did
go
pretty
well
with
the
fish
and
chips
perfectly
complemented
the
fish
and
chips
i
also
had
will
definitely
order
again
could
go
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
the
malts
are
really
quite
nice
as
the
beer
progresses
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
clear
mahogany
ruby
red
pour
with
two
finger
head
nice
lacing
and
decent
retention
strong
fruity
malty
nose
overpowers
any
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
much
the
same
dark
fruit
dominates
along
with
molasses
and
maple
syrup
with
hints
of
nuts
vanilla
cherries
rasins
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
i
get
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
overall
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
which
really
hurts
the
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
quite
easy
to
knock
back
nice
on
a
winters
eve
this
is
an
excellent
esb
the
abv
of
this
on
cask
is
much
lower
than
the
bottle
the
bartender
and
brewery
clip
said
4
7
still
far
outside
the
traditional
session
beer
range
but
much
more
managable
than
what
is
listed
here
overall
just
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
perfect
example
of
an
esb
smooth
rich
body
with
low
creamy
carbonation
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
white
horse
in
london
the
beer
was
bright
copper
colored
with
a
thin
head
that
laced
all
over
the
glass
as
it
emptied
the
aroma
was
nice
difficult
to
compete
with
my
benchmark
for
the
style
fullers
esb
but
still
very
nice
some
fresh
hops
on
top
with
a
toasted
malt
background
the
taste
was
similar
with
some
sweet
and
dark
fruits
apples
plums
raisins
providing
complement
to
the
hops
the
creamy
mouthfeel
from
the
cask
completes
the
experience
a
strong
contender
in
the
style
d
a
moreish
malty
ale
lovely
toasted
malt
backbone
would
go
delicious
with
chocolate
flavours
remind
me
of
a
dunkel
but
with
the
british
velvety
texture
of
a
creamy
ale
delicous
this
is
very
refreshing
a
clean
representation
of
the
style
and
id
love
to
try
this
cask
conditioned
all
n
all
a
great
bitter
d
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
served
with
a
small
cream
colored

and
some

very
clear

about
the
same
with
some

and
good

very
easy

ditto

session
brew
drinkable
sure
i
didnt
really
toss
my
pint
out
the
door
or
anything
went
well
with
my
fish
and
chips
but
compared
to
other
brews
i
had
on
my
trip
it
didnt
stand
out
in
the
least
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
that
i
probably
wont
get
again
bottle
from
the
lcbo
deep
chestnut
pour
unleashed
a
frothy
mocha
cap
leaving
pretty
spiderweb
lace
the
aroma
that
i
was
first
greeted
with
was
caramel
and
then
molasses
dark
fruits
plum
prune
follow
with
a
bit
of
char
and
fruitcake
tastes
of
sweet
fruitcake
and
sugary
nutty
malts
prune
and
dark
plum
come
in
and
add
more
sweetness
which
is
semi
balanced
by
some
metallic
hops
problem
is
i
hate
the
taste
of
fruitcake
this
is
not
really
good
looks
fantastic
tawny
with
ruby
highlights
topped
with
a
massive
creamy
offwhite
head
left
a
great
lacing
all
the
way
to
end
chocolate
mixed
with
some
raisin
like
fruitcake
notes
a
bit
of
old
hop
action
going
on
palatewise
it
jumps
out
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
flecking
chico
and
coffe
and
chocolatecherry
ripe
long
finish
with
a
rounded
bitterness
wish
i
had
some
chocolate
truffles
to
go
with
it
overall
broadside
is
pretty
enjoyable
stuff
that
i
could
drink
on
the
regular
with
no
hesitation
the
aroma
was
a
little
subdued
smelled
like
fruit
the
taste
was
sweet
malty
goodness
with
a
bitterness
that
came
on
down
the
finish
line
in
the
mouth
it
was
pretty
well
carbonated
and
this
would
be
a
brew
if
i
lived
in
england
i
would
sessionize
good
drinkable
brew
overall
this
one
looks
like
apple
cider
and
doesnt
taste
far
from
it
this
may
be
your
style
but
it
didnt
do
it
for
me
well
worth
a
try
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
which
was
slightly
larger
than
a
12
oz
and
smaller
than
a
bomber
cost
about
3
us
if
this
was
a
bit
less
expensive
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
well
recommended
would
really
like
to
try
the
ontap
version
sometime
drinkability
high
what
a
great
enjoyable
beer
a
bit
like
the
2eme
or
3eme
gc
bordeaux
everything
is
perfectly
balanced
and
smooth
no
rough
edges
no
lumps
and
bumps
if
you
are
looking
for
a
perfectly
executed
medium
bodied
fruity
ale
this
one
might
be
just
as
good
as
it
gets
drinkability
too
much
body
for
a
session
beer
heaviness
hurts
its
quaffability
walnut
brown
clear
with
nice
sudsy
head
in
the
glass
tasted
sidebyside
with
a
london
pride
the
quintessence
of
english
bitter
the
extra
body
and
content
of
this
beer
was
very
evident
nice
balance
of
malty
fruitiness
and
hop
on
draft
it
slips
down
with
unreal
ease
very
high
marks
for
this
of
course
i
have
long
had
a
soft
spot
for
adnams
it
could
make
a
good
session
ale
like
most
british
browns
but
i
much
prefer
youngs
or
samuel
smith
which
go
down
smoother
with
a
bit
more
flavor
overall
a
decent
brew
definitely
sessionable
worth
a
try
d
nice
flavourful
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
is
really
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
before
but
i
love
it
one
of
the
finest
esbs
ive
ever
had
although
im
not
sure
i
would
lump
this
beer
into
the
esb
category
so
hastily
it
is
really
a
strange
cross
between
a
hoppy
brown
ale
and
a
dopplebock
in
my
opinion
very
tasty
i
will
go
back
for
more
taste
is
very
malty
lots
of
dark
toasted
malts
that
are
moderately
sweet
break
to
a
drying
hop
on
the
finish
but
never
enough
to
overpower
the
wonderful
toasty
malts
that
are
the
base
of
this
beer
not
a
session
beer
but
i
do
like
a
couple
of
this
one
on
a
cold
queensland
night
18c
or
64f
b
looking
forward
to
visiting
southwold
seems
this
beer
would
be
great
from
a
cask
hazy
dark
copperbrown
hue
a
large
beige
head
is
initially
produced
which
settles
to
a
light
frothy
layer
that
produces
some
good
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
vinous
dark
fruits
and
toffee
flavours
are
rich
with
dark
fruits
and
apples
alcohol
noticeable
the
bitterness
is
fairly
restrained
produces
a
clean
finish
with
some
lingering
bitter
notes
full
creamy
mouthfeel
with
great
fine
carbonation
which
creates
just
enough
liveliness
on
the
tongue
it
sounds
like
a
normal
bitter
but
there
is
something
different
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
the
beer
boasts
plenty
of
body
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
was
designed
for
the
cask
the
bottled
edition
boasts
a
very
bitter
and
sharp
aftertaste
that
actually
spoils
the
enjoyment
overall
strong
and
warming
yet
very
pleasant
drinking
perfect
for
a
session
beer
on
a
cold
day
a
strong
beer
with
the
caramelly
maltiness
either
barely
dominating
or
holding
the
assertive
bitterness
in
check
adnams
are
pushing
their
beers
into
the
free
trade
more
and
more
at
the
moment
and
are
expanding
their
beers
are
now
available
all
over
the
uk
i
have
not
detected
any
lowering
of
standards
or
tastes
of
any
of
their
beers
i
try
them
whenever
i
come
across
them
broadside
at
its
best
is
a
very
very
good
beer
simply
english
premium
cask
bitter
at
its
best
spicy
notes
of
challenger
hops
malty
and
rich
but
not
overpowering
after
the
first
pint
the
second
is
enevitable
if
you
find
it
on
a
bar
in
england
it
would
be
rude
not
to
try
it
think
warm
summer
evening
in
a
english
country
pub
garden
after
a
hard
game
of
tennis
broadside
is
a
drink
to
sip
gently
talk
about
then
finish
off
in
large
mouthfuls
adnams
have
acheived
a
perfect
balance
of
robust
and
easy
to
drink
dont
buy
the
bottled
version
thinking
its
the
same
drink
it
is
very
different
very
good
indeed
but
very
different
okay
i
have
had
the
cask
version
a
number
of
times
in
april
2007
while
visiting
london
i
found
it
to
be
an
excellent
session
ale
so
my
drinkability
score
would
be
a
4
oh
my
what
a
terrific
ale
i
must
say
this
poured
much
darker
than
i
was
anticipating
a
dark
cloudy
bronze
red
colour
with
a
lovely
khaki
coloured
head
it
looked
wonderful
the
smell
is
delicious
with
loads
of
caramel
and
other
sweet
candylike
nuances
there
is
also
a
pleasant
measure
of
hops
detectable
as
well
the
taste
is
a
magnificent
balace
of
caramel
and
hops
as
both
the
sweetness
and
the
hops
bitterness
seem
to
manifest
themselves
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
making
this
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
measure
of
carbonation
in
a
truly
wonderful
english
esb
smashing
and
a
special
thanks
to
ba
ding
for
being
kind
enough
to
provide
me
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
lovely
treat
poured
a
nice
crimson
color
with
an
eggshell
colored
head
that
left
behind
some
lacing
and
contained
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
sugar
plums
roasted
malt
and
sea
salt
seemed
apparent
the
taste
was
somewhat
smokey
with
strong
malt
flavors
the
beer
was
engaging
with
a
bitterness
that
grows
with
each
sip
and
dominates
the
finish
slightly
chewy
texture
with
a
smooth
and
refreshing
good
flavors
and
low
alcohol
content
make
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
all
in
all
this
is
ok
but
im
not
terribly
impressed
this
just
doesnt
strike
me
as
very
english
i
hadnt
had
an
english
beer
in
a
long
time
adnams
broadside
is
a
good
way
to
get
reacquainted
drinkability
a
great
beer
at
a
great
price
99
cents
a
bottle
on
sale
at
jungle
jims
woo
hoo
md
mediumbodied
and
lively
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
is
rounder
than
round
and
softer
than
soft
with
a
touch
of
oil
against
its
wellbalanced
flavour
profile
its
simply
a
bliss
as
far
as
a
draught
ale
is
concerned
after
having
tried
this
fantastic
draught
version
of
broadside
five
years
ago
in
a
sussex
village
this
is
my
first
time
to
bump
into
the
same
ale
in
such
perfect
condtion
a
distinctive
ale
imo
from
its
own
stronger
cousin
and
equally
impressive
its
mild
easy
to
drink
one
or
two
but
i
wouldnt
finish
the
case
with
this
one
not
a
party
beer
overall
well
worth
a
try

this

reminds
me
why
i
love
a
good
solid
english
esb
its
a
mahogany
color
with
a
rocky
stable
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
malt
and
fruity
faint
butterscotch
in
the
smell
as
well
and
hint
of
ethanol
sweet
malt
tastes
caramel
lightly
toasted
malts
and
a
medium
hop
balance
combine
in
the
flavor
relatively
low
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
creamy
fullbodied
mouthfeel
its
substantial
and
very
satisfying
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
wows
you
but
it
is
thoroughly
compelling
and
would
be
a
hell
of
a
session
brew
very
well
executed
english
bitter
though
past
the
freshness
date
it
has
been
stored
well
and
exhibits
no
hint
of
oxidation
wonderful
brew
from
the
sunrise

of
england
this
is
something
that
should
not
be
missed
if
it
is
available
in
your
area
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of

but
this
was
a

consumption
this

a

the

this
was
a

color
when
poured
it
had
this
great
frothy

that
covered
the

it
had
a
wonderful
fresh
bready
aroma
i
found
the
taste
mild
biscuity
and
astringent
in
the
finish
very
enjoyable
and
nice
to
see
on

this

beer
some
muted

character
with
an
aroma
of
caramel
the
medium
body
is
nutty
and
tastes
of
cherry
fruitiness
and
is
quite
malty
it
finishes
dry
with
tastes
of
mint
and
hay
which
balances
the
malty
body
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
because
it
is
quite
appetizing
and
easy
on
the
palate
excellent

that
receded
into
some
elegant

smell
was
wonderfully
full
of
raisins
and
biscuity
maltiness
taste
was
much
more
distinctly
bitter
with
a
goof
hop
presence
despite
the
cask
effect
and
a
good
full
bodied
flavor
that
was
ripe
and
estery
but
by
no
means
over
the
top
a
wonderful
session
brew
that
is
worthy
of
several
pints
that
i
sadly
did
not
have
time
for
hopefully
it
will
be
there
still
on
sunday
night
flavor
is
some
caramel
with
almost
a
buttery
toffee
flavor
and
texture
a
light
piney
hop
finish
at
the
end
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
great
drinkability
and
a
perfect
english
session
beer
with
a
bit
more
malt
going
on
than
most
ordinary
or
special
bitters
a
nice
surprise
at
montys

last
evening
and
cask
conditioned

boot
impressive
and
rich
in
appearance
with
a
deep
caramel
and

colour
incredibly
creamy

that
decorates

sides

i
quaff
my
20oz

from

the
nose
is
bready
sweet
suggesting
the
grains
and
steaming
hot
wort
from
which
the
brew
originated
also
evident
is
a
fruity
aroma
with
notes
of
grape
and
plum
hops
take
a
back
seat
here
the
taste
is
a
delicate
mix
of
the
intricate
aromas
and
a
surprising
warming
for
a
brew
at
4
7
abv
hops
provide
balance
only
exhibiting
a
subtle
pine
hint
here
and
there
the
ease
of
drinkability
is
scary
cheers
to
publican
william
taggert
for
this
gem
and
often
having
the
knack
for
providing
something
different
and
interesting
i
really
dug
this
beer
i
must
say
that
this
beer
makes
me
a
little
disappointed
i
expected
a
wellcrafted
complex
and
generous
strong
ale
but
what
i
got
was
just
an
aggressive
yet
plain
bitterness
with
a
taste
of
alcohol
that
belongs
to
much
cheaper
beers

to
a

by

never

anchors
the

dry
with
some
subtle

a
note
of
yeasty

and
a
residual
bitterness
that
leaves
the

refreshed
and
ready

quite
tasty
and
a
surprisingly
drinkable
ale
considering
its
6
abv
the
draft
version
is
4
7
abv
the
alcohol
remains
almost
completely
cloaked
throughout
a
bit
strong
for
an
all
night
session
ale
but
maybe
one
to
get
you
started
well
worth
trying
thick
foamy
light
brownish
tan
colored
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
beer
is
syrupy
brown
in
color
almost
like
cola
the
aroma
is
a
little
bit
chocolately
mixed
with
lightly
sweet
malt
caramel
and
sweet
malt
dominate
the
initial
flavor
i
think
theres
some
hops
in
there
that
cut
the
initial
sweetness
but
they
never
make
themselves
fully
known
a
good
flavorful
beer
a
bit
on
the
sweetside
but
not
too
much
drinkablity
very
solid
english
ale
good
everyday
brew
on
cask
at
the
famous
white
horse
in
parsons
green
this
stuff
rocks
a
dark
amber
coloured
brew
with
a
white
cap
of
foam
the
aromas
are
very
hoppy
fruity
and
very
very
wellbalanced
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
fruity
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
and
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
ohso
smooth
the
drinkability
you
may
ask
wonderful
i
really
never
notice
that
its
quite
strong
even
for
a
traditional
english
ale
but
that
is
yet
another
thing
about
broadside
that
makes
me
give
it
consideration
every
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
top
quality
beer
from
the
u
k
i
cant
wait
to
head
over
there
next
year
and
get
into
some
of
this
from
the
keg
the
beer
is
a
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
amber
to
it
i
had
to
try
real
hard
to
get
some
head
out
of
it
and
it
dissapated
right
away
maybe
some
fruitiness
to
the
nose
not
much
else
the
taste
is
mostly
a
medium
maly
sweetness
i
also
get
the
taste
of
alcohol
suprising
since
the
beer
is
only
6
3
maybe
some
bitterness
at
the
end
it
is
almost
trying
to
be
a
barleywine
but
it
doesnt
really
impress
at
all
this
totally
british
ale
is
dull
gold
in
color
and
possesses
a
moderately
smooth
herbal
malt
with
woody
notes
amply
hopped
with
a
complex
blend
providing
some
tea
citrus
and
hints
of
metallic
bitterness
the
aroma
is
fresh
and
pleasantly
malty
this
is
a
mild
ale
well
balanced
with
nothing
jumping
out
the
head
bubbles
are
larger
than
expected
and
dissipate
rapidly
a
wellmade
ale
pretty
good
quiet
smooth
malty
flavour
quite
a
nice
caramelly
roasty
flavour
a
bit
sweet
but
balanced
by
a
decent
bitter
finish
i
kn
dof
like
it
quite
smoooth
aswell
decent
i
tried
this
at
the
famous
whitehorse
pub
in
london
a
midbrown
beer
that
was
very
very
smooth
hops
were
on
the
restrained
side
and
there
was
hint
of
fruitiness
i
found
the
flavor
lacked
distinction
but
it
was
very
very
drinkable
lace
was
nonexistent
which
accounts
for
the
lower
appearance
ranking
overall
for
12
bucks
a
4
pack
this
is
just
rediculous
and
only
3
7
abv
pass
this
up
sweet
finish
with
some
very
soft
applelike
finish
with
moderate
carbonation
a
solid
beer
of
its
style
decent
finish
though
a
bit
dry
and
sparse
tasting
it
smelled
of
caramel
and
a
slight
hoppiness
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
scotch
ale
which
has
that
unique
taste
to
it
it
had
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
which
rounded
it
out
nicely
to
me
overall
a
good
esb
and
i
would
recommend
it
conclusion
not
bad
not
great
its
pretty
on
target
for
a
special
bitter
but
its
a
little
tart
and
aggressively
bitter
without
much
hop
flavor
for
my
taste
id
really
like
a
fresh
sample
to
compare
this
to
as
i
think
this
beer
might
have
greater
potential
than
shown
here
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
well
made
esb
with
a
solid
taste
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
a
good
amount
of
bitter
hops
some
leather
minor
citrus
and
a
medium
dry
finish
not
a
bad
esb
overall
quite
sessionable
considering
the
4
5
abv
i
enjoyed
this
pretty
much
everything
you
want
in
the
style
i
just
find
it
a
bit
typical
though
i
will
take
a
typical
esb
over
most
anything
else
a
mix
bag
here
there
is
some
tartness
and
fruit
notes
from
the
hops
yet
this
fullerbodied
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
and
has
some
sweet
malt
taste
to
it
finishes
with
a
dry
backbite
a
great
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
pours
a
nice
slightly
clear
ruby
reddeep
orange
amber
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
good
lace
nose
is
mostly
malty
taste
has
a
good
malt
profile
with
some
decent
british
hop
presence
almost
some
toffee
or
caramel
hints
in
here
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
a
bit
thick
nice
dry
finish
drinkability
is
good
but
not
the
best
overall
a
good
english
bitter
and
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
im
not
that
crazy
about
it
but
it
is
a
good
representation
i
think
this
bottle
may
be
a
bit
old
a
good
brew
but
there
are
enough
better
bitters
available
that
i
probably
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
again
except
maybe
at
a
bar
mfd
a
creamy
and
smooth
medium
bodied
esb
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
sam
smiths
nut
brown
great
flavor
coats
mouth
well
and
left
a
sweet
taste
on
my
lips
highly
recommended
drinkability
smooth
and
very
drinkable
good
for
warm
or
cold
weather
i
could
deal
with
this
beer
just
fine
in
a
session
i
hope
our
paths
cross
again
on
this
beer
i
will
enjoy
a
great
many
more
this
reminds
me
very
much
of
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
this
is
a
good
beer
but
is
very
much
a
british
bitter
not
an
american
one
drinkability
is
hampered
somewhat
by
the
slightly
bittersour
taste
but
otherwise
a
nice
esb
and
probably
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
recommended
ok
beer
is
the
best
i
can
do
on
this
one
this
esb
pours
a
dark
foggy
copper
with
a
nice
1
5
offwhite
colored
head
stickiness
is
pretty
good
here
and
there
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
quite
buttery
with
a
nice
toffee
undertone
i
also
detect
some
pepperspice
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
a
nice
nutty
malt
with
a
unique
pearmango
flavoring
as
well
there
seems
to
be
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
that
tries
to
surface
but
the
malt
pushes
it
back
down
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
could
use
a
few
m
ore
bubbles
drinkability
is
scary
good
could
easily
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
hmmmm
note
to
self
16
9oz
brown
bottle
from
florians
hazy
redorange
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
caramel
malt
and
diacetyl
characterize
the
aroma
tastes
like
grassy
hops
and
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
to
make
a
butterscotchlike
flavor
medium
bodied
somewhat
aqueous
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
one
other
than
being
slightly
astringent
its
fairly
drinkable
and
a
pretty
solid
english
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
smooth
good
amount
of
carbonation
is
very
nice
terrific
bitter
id
love
to
have
it
in
a
local
pub
expensive
but
ive
already
bought
it
again
drinkability
an
average
but
tasty
beer
i
reviewed
this
one
the
day
after
reviewing
the
broadside
strong
ale
and
while
its
similar
in
some
regards
from
its
coloration
to
its
generous
tan
head
and
lacing
it
differs
in
many
others
the
nose
is
different
for
one
exhibiting
a
pronounced
hop
bitterness
and
restrained
malt
profile
the
mouthfeel
wow
seriously
this
is
one
ofthe
most
complex
and
generous
tipples
ive
had
for
a
while
in
this
regard
so
soft
and
easydrinking
youd
swear
it
was
nitropushed
its
also
one
of
the
creamiest
beers
ive
ever
put
my
lips
to
more
biscuity
malt
in
the
profile
as
it
warms
making
for
a
sweetsour
and
tangy
but
not
really
so
sweet
ale
light
in
body
much
more
of
a
snack
than
a
meal
and
plenty
refreshing
all
the
way
to
its
dry
bitternesslingering
finish
bitter
is
in
the
name
and
this
ale
is
true
to
style
and
as
with
the
brakspears
i
reviewed
a
few
days
ago
i
really
wish
there
were
more
wellmade
bitters
produced
domestically
on
the
micro
front
because
its
a
wonderful
style
when
executed
properly
and
by
properly
i
mean
everything
from
nose
and
mouthfeel
to
bitter
hoprestrained
malt
balance
and
low
alcohol
from
my
experience
a
good
bitter
doesnt
usually
top
5
and
some
of
the
better
ones
ive
downed
barely
hit
4
now
this
sort
of
admiration
of
a
lowalcohol
brew
might
sound
strange
coming
from
a
guy
who
likes
his
big
beers
once
in
a
while
but
the
term
session
beer
originated
with
the
british
practice
of
quaffing
just
such
lowalcohol
pints
of
ale
for
long
afternoons
in
a
pub
a
practice
almost
unthinkable
to
young
american
drinkers
weaned
on
keg
stands
40s
and
natty
ice
america
as
we
all
know
by
now
tends
to
be
the
land
of
more
and
faster
and
this
holds
true
to
our
partying
tactics
as
we
typically
try
to
liven
things
up
by
consuming
more
alcohol
faster
than
other
cultures
but
dont
worry
the
british
bitters
im
raving
about
here
are
imports
and
on
the
expensive
side
their
lowalcohol
kin
will
never
appeal
to
joe
sixpack
nor
will
they
supplant
the
american
premium
and
popular
brands
out
there
complete
with
their
highgravity
brewing
methods
adjuncts
and
6
abv
to
get
you
fooked
up
in
the
back
seat
of
yer
chevy
deep
copper
coloured
very
slightly
cloudy
with
a
large
fluffy
head
that
retains
well
throughout
and
produces
some
lacing
the
aroma
does
not
seem
particularly
strong
at
first
but
later
livens
up
with
caramel
malt
herbal
hops
and
some
fruit
aromas
the
taste
is
superb
good
malt
and
hops
flavours
well
balanced
with
a
very
pleasing
long
bitterness
on
swallowing
moderately
carbonation
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
taste
better
on
tap
a
very
enjoyable
ale
us
east
anglians
should
be
very
proud
of
i
cant
wait
to
go
home
and
go
to
southwold
overall
a
pleasing
beer
not
a
standout
but
a
more
than
adequate
example
adnams
suffolk
special
bitter
was
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
lots
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
malty
the
taste
was
a
good
blend
of
malts
and
english
hops
with
some
fruity
and
toasted
flavors
the
finish
was
dry
and
slightly
bitter
the
body
was
medium
to
full
with
medium
carbonation
it
was
sort
of
creamy
drinkability
was
good
it
would
work
fine
for
a
session
beer
d
refreshing
with
a
great
taste
get
out
your
loafers
this
ones
a
session
beer
a
well
made
beer
d
very
drinkable
indeed
good
session
beer
this
one
drinkability
very
glad
to
have
had
this
friendly
pour
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
brew
again
and
i
truly
hope
to
partake
of
a
pint
or
more
of
this
on
tap
one
day
a
fine
english
bitter
no
yeast
on
the
bottom
or
bottling
date
dammit
oh
well
cant
have
everything
it
did
have
a
lot
number
but
that
crap
is
worthless
still
an
exceptional
drinking
brew
surprisingly
thick
feel
but
of
course
with
very
low
carbonation
a
lovely
easy
drinking
bitter
this
beer
pours
a
wonderful
amberrust
color
with
a
thick
firm
white
head
the
liquid
is
slightly
hazy
and
the
lace
is
fantastic
toasted
malts
and
caramel
are
the
center
of
the
aroma
theyre
met
with
a
slight
and
fitting
butterscotch
smell
and
a
little
hops
the
aroma
is
solidly
malty
however
and
very
enticing
the
taste
is
moderately
sweet
with
a
buiscuit
and
toffee
character
theres
a
slight
bitterness
that
doesnt
come
into
its
own
until
the
finish
giving
the
beer
a
nice
balance
on
the
whole
the
beer
is
slanted
toward
the
sweet
side
of
things
full
body
with
relatively
low
carbonation
this
brew
is
essentially
right
on
target
its
got
a
lot
of
character
and
is
delicious
mouth
enters
with
a
prickly
mouthfeel
that
mellows
out
to
a
smooth
finish
in
the
back
its
a
dry
finish
with
a
bitterness
that
takes
over
the
whole
mouth
grassy
flavors
abound
bringing
some
feelings
of
a
hay
field
in
the
summer
the
roasty
flavors
of
the
malts
add
a
taste
of
banana
and
good
balance
midmount
through
the
finish
the
swallow
mixes
earthy
mint
and
chocolate
flavors
overall
a
first
class
bitter
one
of
my
favourites
everything
is
perfectly
balanced
very
drinkable
recommended
the
taste
is
well
bitter
great
hops
and
a
lovely
toasted
maltiness
caramel
while
very
muted
is
certainly
present
if
youre
looking
for
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
indeed
with
a
fantastic
level
of
carbonation
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
finishes
very
gently
without
any
sort
of
powerful
or
otherwise
offensive
flavour
or
carbonation
sting
i
think
this
is
a
fabulous
example
of
the
style
i
am
glad
i
revisited
it
pours
a
deep
cloudy
amber
with
a
starkingly
white
head
it
has
a
immediate
hoppy
and
malty
aroma
when
poured
very
drinkable
and
pleasurable
the
definition
of
a
special
bitter
decent
hops
good
malt
low
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
obviously
more
than
if
it
was
on
cask
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
more
than
a
few
on
englands
east
shore
when
i
have
drunk
other
beers
from
admans
i
have
often
found
an
odd
funny
chemical
hoppy
taste
that
i
didnt
like
at
all
but
in
this
one
the
powerful
malt
balanced
that
flavour
a
nice
special
bitter
the
dryness
made
this
a
relatively
drinkable
beer
this
poured
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
the
color
was
a
lighttomedium
amber
with
a
slightly
cloudy
cast
to
it
the
nose
was
both
malty
sweet
and
yeastdriven
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bordering
on
creamy
i
got
a
great
nutty
flavor
like
almonds
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
had
a
lemony
tartness
to
it
a
really
wonderful
beer
this
pours
a
dark
cloudy
orange
amber
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
the
smell
has
a
sweet
malt
aromanot
too
strong
but
a
nice
scent
the
taste
has
a
creamy
malt
sweetness
to
it
then
a
hop
bitterness
thats
not
bad
this
is
a
quality
beer
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
the
mf
is
medium
with
a
good
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
a
classic
english
brew
that
will
not
be
overlooked
cheers
very
english
very
good
recommended
the
head
quickly
disipated
after
only
a
minute
or
two
the
flavor
was
slightly
oxidized
and
stale
with
a
significant
yeast
bite
right
at
the
start
hmmm
wonder
if
this
one
was
in
the
beer
fridge
too
long
about
910
months
if
i
remember
correctly
oh
well
not
something
i
would
persue
for
flavor
the
aroma
and
appearance
gave
me
better
expectations
but
ill
still
finish
it
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
actively
carbonated
d
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
the
flavor
is
startling
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
if
im
looking
for
an
esb
i
will
absolutely
choose
fullers
over
this
but
this
is
a
uniquely
tasty
beverage
this
wonderful
bitter
pours
rather
dark
with
a
cherry
wood
color
and
an
appealing
head
the
nose
is
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
malts
and
floral
nectary
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
flowery
bitterness
that
has
nice
earthy
undertones
mouthfeel
is
rather
still
but
very
smooth
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
multiple
sips
and
multiple
pints
very
good
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
copper
tone
the
heads
a
beaut
nice
and
frothy
while
slowly
settling
away
and
leaving
a
white
lace
on
the
glass
first
smell
is
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
coming
through
in
the
background
this
is
am
awesome
bitter
that
has
nice
malt
flavors
that
eventually
dissipate
to
hoppy
fun
this
one
is
all
about
balance
this
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
that
in
tandem
with
the
balanced
flavor
and
relatively
low
abv
make
it
painlessly
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
being
only
the
second
beer
ive
tried
from
the
adnams
brewery
i
will
have
to
try
the
remaining
selections
from
this
brewery
hopefully
their
strong
ale
is
better
this
is
a
very
solid
bitter
ale
mouthfeel
is
juicy
with
biscuit
flavors
there
is
a
grainy
quality
to
each
sip
too
sweet
orange
juice
presence
with
a
biting
hop
snap
on
the
finish
good
drinkability
level
very
enjoyable
beer
all
around
please
pick
this
up
much
better
than
the
sawtooth
when
compare
bottle
to
bottle
but
the
sawtooth
is
much
better
compared
bottle
to
draft
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
drinkability
quite
enjoyable
if
you
like
the
english
style
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
with
a
definite
astringency
on
the
sides
of
my
mouth
typical
of
this
kind
of
a
session
beer
i
can
drink
this
and
in
the
right
session
i
would
probably
enjoy
it
just
fine
but
overall
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
500
ml
bottle
adnams
ssb
pours
out
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
all
dark
malt
and
caramel
creamy
malt
flavor
with
soem
gentle
leafy
hops
a
little
nuttiness
in
the
flavor
caramel
flavor
throughout
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
in
this
beer
not
much
fruit
a
little
buttery
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
great
drinkability
not
quite
as
delicious
as
the
broadside
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
note
i
was
able
to
get
this
adnams
at
a
close
out
99
cent
price
a
real
quality
bargain
in
my
book
i
went
back
for
more
ive
been
buying
accouple
every
time
i
stop
in
and
see
them
poured
an
orangeyamber
color
with
a
sticky
carbonation
that
clings
to
the
glass
nice
sandy
colored
head
of
toffee
cream
the
aroma
is
simply
spicy
with
some
sweet
malts
mixed
in
flavor
is
light
spicy
sweet
and
malty
full
of
simple
flavors
and
comes
through
as
appealing
overall
very
easy
to
drink
the
finish
has
a
spicy
lemon
snap
of
crisp
malt
bitterness
is
dead
on

flavorful
and
overall
very
nice
md
very
refreshing
and
lively
mouthfeel
throughout
without
turning
thiner
mediumbodied
and
mediumflavoured
best
bitter
this
beer
has
shows
a
healthy
balance
of
malts
and
hops
and
maintains
a
moderate
profile
throughout
exceptionally
quaffable
and
tasty
esp
for
bestbitterlovers
yet
another
fantastic
beer
by
adnamsrecommended
a
nice
beer
i
thought
it
was
good
for
a
buttery
english
ale
every
once
in
a
while
i
go
through
phases
where
i
enjoy
that
taste
and
when
that
time
comes
i
will
likely
revisit
adnams
tasted
090305
poured
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
slightly

foamy

smell
is
fruity
and
doughy
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
toasty
malt
also
present
finished
creamy
and
refreshing
very
good
beer
overall
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
would
make
a
fantastic
session
beer
given
the
low
abv
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
i
would
buy
this
one
again
could
be
a
staple
in
the
beer
fridge
could
also
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
those
new
to
craft
beers
i
will
be
rereviewing
it
with
a
fresh
bottle
soon
just
an
excuse
to
have
more
of
it
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
flat
in
taste
a
bit
tad
watery
sharp
hoppish
and
bitter
of
course
with

flavours
shy
banana
and
apple
flavours
too
a
low
malted
character
of

shy
notes
of

are
also
present
reminds
me
of
a
very
bitter
ice
tea
enjoyed
this
one
first
during
my
fourth
of
july
bbq
went
well
with
the
grilled
chicken
being
served
nice
and
smooth
one
of
its
best
characteristics
was
how
well
it
went
down
frothy
head
to
start
and
it
seemed
to
be
lighter
on
the
bottom
than
the
top
nice
balance
of
hops
drinkable
for
the
style
quite
an
interesting
esb
not
bad
at
all
and
definitely
worth
trying
this
is
a
solid
british
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
worth
a
try
nice
light
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
tingle
from
the
carbonation
make
this
a
good
session
brew
good
dinner
beer
d
this
is
a
wonderful
esb
it
has
nice
hops
and
good
malt
that
balance
each
other
it
is
a
little
low
on
alcohol
and
i
think
that
would
give
it
just
the
right
finish
pours
a
yellowbrown
color
with
good
but
light
head
smell
is
primarily
hoppy
taste
is
good
a
good
mix
of
sweetness
and
hops
extra
special
bitters
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
drinkable
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
but
tasty
enough
to
bring
some
real
flavor
highlights
to
a
meal
not
my
absolute
favorite
esb
but
a
much
better
beer
than
many
recommended
best

a

in

for

on
this

i
like
it
pours

color
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
thin
rings
of

mild
aroma
of

and
really
not
very
bitter
for
a
bitter
fuggles
hops
citrus
and
malt
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
leading
to
an
understated
character
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
fruity
and
clean
not
really
extraordinary
but
i
had
no
problems
drinking
it
at
all
pours
what
a
typical
english
ale
should
look
like
in
my
opinion
caramel
in
color
with
a
touch
of
orange
hue
an
average
white
head
which
reduced
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
smell
is
light
mainly
of
hops
with
some
malty
sweetness
a
touch
of
pine
and
resin
hops
again
typically
english
in
nature
taste
is
nice
with
an
initial
hop
drynessbitterness
up

which
transitions
to
a
bit
of
butter
finishes
malty

im
really
digging
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
not
really
thin
at
all
and
actually
a
bit
creamy
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
nice
light
flavor
with
a
full
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
easy
should
be
good
with
the
ribs
and
brunswick
stew
im
having
with
it
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
decent
foamy
head
which
lingers
a
bit
lacey
too
the
nose
is

citric
grapefruity
the
taste
is
malt

hops
in

balance
a
bit

caramel
at
the
back
and
a
great
bitter
hops
kick
at
the
finish
a
full
bodied
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
and
its
quite
drinkable
yes
gives
the
fullers
a
run
for
the
money
overall
truly
excellent
english
ale
a
great
brew
the
perfect
levels
of
carbonation
and
great
buttery
mouthfeel
mean
this
beer
goes
down
well
highly
recommended
pours
a
honeyed
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
light
beige
colored

head
good
hop
to

ratio
in
the
nose
the
malt
has
reminisces
of
honey
and
has
a
light
buttery
diacetyl
scent
the
hops
are
meadowy
and
lightly
spicy
aside
from
it
being
malty
and
hoppy
it
has
an
underlying
mineral
taste
midswallow
that
blends
well
with
the
astringency
from
the
hops
in
the
finish

tastes
quite
a
bit
different
than
the
can
of
it
that
i
had
two
nights
ago
more
hoppy
strange
because
its
from
the
same
fourpack
my
palate
must
have
been
in
a
different
condition
at
that
point
than
it
was
tonight
in
any
case
an
enjoyable
beer
that
ill
probably
drink
again
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
that
leaves
lots
of
patches
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
digestive
discuits
honey
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
of
biscuits
spicey
herbal
hops
and
buttery
diacytl
the
diacytl
is
quite
evident
though
its
not
overpowering
the
carbonation
is
very
vigorous
but
leaves
a
subtle
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
definitely
better
than
adnams
broadside
perhaps
because
of
the
higher
level
of
hops
making
a
more
balanced
beer
a
good
english
bitter
im
usually
suspicious
of
fancy
packaging
the
snazzy
bottle
this
came
in
had
me
thinking
that
it
enclosed
another
standard
or
unremarkable
beer
i
was
wrong
on
this
one
pours

the
front
of

with

with

showing
up

the

the

only
comes
in
at
the

in
the
after
taste
a
wonerfully
buttery
smooth
malt
pronounced
bitter
that
is
not
really
bitter
but
drying
in
its
finish
its
satisfying
without
being
heavy
a
very
well

nice

up

then
the

i

is
that
my

not

imparted

from

except
the
biting
bitterness
lightly
metallic
in
the
finish
crisp
and
dry
lingering
hoppiness
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
solid
special
bitter
but
not
enough
to
knock
my
socks
off
a
good
change
of
pace
though
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
in
a
style
i
dont
usually
seek
out
i
was
very
pleased
with
my
choice
this
evening
sampled
5104
drinkability
is
a
very
good
need
to
on
draught
or
cask
to
assess
how
good
but
very
nice
brew
ill
be
honest
with
this
brew
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
because
i
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
luckily
this
is
a
really
good
beer
pours
out
a
dark
copperamber
color
with
some
nice
carbonation
visible
that
stays
with
you
the
entire
time
smell
consists
of
roasted
malts
mostly
with
some
nutty
aromas
and
some
spiciness
as
well
which
was
interesting
taste
consists
of
malts
upfront
and
stays
with
you
into
the
aftertaste
but
some
caramel
nutty
flavors
and
some
slight
fruit
notes
also
ride
along
the
palate
this
is
pretty
balanced
aftertaste
had
some
hop
kick
to
it
which
seemed
to
belong
in
this
brew
and
at
the
very
end
some
peppery
flavors
show
up
and
last
for
a
long
time
this
is
a
good
example
of
esb
and
do
pick
some
up
when
you
see
this
brew
a
great
bitter
something
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
probably
good
with
a
variety
of
food
also
just
fantastic
the
beer
was
obtained
in
a
500
ml
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
28
december
2004
the
beer
poured
out
with
a
reddish
amber
clear
body
and
a
1
inch
thick
foamy
beige
head
that
was
pretty
persistent
and
left
pretty
nice
lace
the
aroma
was
very
mild
and
unremarkable
with
mostly
fruity
smelling
malt
and
little
to
no
hops
the
taste
was
also
pretty
sweet
with
cherries
and
plums
there
was
also
quite
a
bit
of
roasted
nutty
background
to
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
creamy
at
the
start
of
the
sip
with
a
sticky
feel
mid
palette
but
the
finish
was
quite
watery
and
weak
a
passable
session
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
one

into
an
imperial

around
for

aroma
is
slightly
malty
backed
with
a
minimal
but
sharp
hops
scent
taste
is
initially
of
the
grains
but
the
hops
chime
in
and
provide
a
crisp
end
to
the
experience
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
very
good
this
brew
is
representative
of
what
i
would
expect
a
standard
bitter
in
the
uk
would
be
like
hunkered
down
at
a
dark
pub
in
front
of
the
fire
possibly
watching
some
sports
sessionability
is
superb
the
taste
was
quite
bitter
yet
crisp
and
not
overly
malty
it
lived
up
to

very

ive
heard
good
things
about
adnams
so
i
figured
id
give
them
a
try
this
one
pours
an
iced
tea
like
cloudy
amber
colour
its
topped
with
a
foamy
head
that
looks
light
and
short
lasting
and
it
is
for
the
most
part
smells
of
malt
caramel
and
wet
wood
with
a
touch
of
sourness
present
pretty
standard
fare
here
the
taste
is
as
well
only
slightly
above
average
theres
a
basic
watery
taste
that
dominates
and
holds
off
any
real
flavour
what
flavour
is
there
is
in
the
back
and
consists
of
what
was
described
in
the
smell
above
malt
in
the
front
caramel
in
the
middle
still
mixed
with
malt
so
not
too
sweet
and
a
dry
bitter
wood
finish
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
high
here
i
would
have
expected
something
a
bit
smoother
and
creamier
for
an
esb
not
at
all
bad
but
not
one
id
run
immediately
back
to
this
pours
a
reddish
and
clear
amber
with
a
fluffy
whitish
head
lots
of
bubbles
evident
spring
up
in
the
pint
class
to
replenish
as
the
head
recedes
the
aroma
is
slighlty
metallic
malts
with
light
citrus
hops
and
definitive
caramel
underneath
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
expected
and
the
taste
is
a
little
smoky
but
not
all
that
distinct
otherwise
frankly
it
does
not
start
with
much
flavor
though
it
is
appropriately
bitter
and
a
touch
buttery
at
the
finish
pleasantly
average
this
beer
had
no
offensive
qualities
i
feel
its
the
perfect
representative

its

a

i
havent
tasted
a
big
variety
of
esbs
so
my
opinion
of
this
one
may
change
after
i
try
a
bunch
more
it
pours
a
dark
amber
colour
into
the
glass
the
head
is
pretty
thick
and
tan
coloured
it
disappeares
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
little
fruity
and
you
can
also
smell
some
caramel
in
the
first
zip
i
took
i
could
taste
appels
even
half
way
through
the
beer
i
taste
appels
it
also
has
a
crisp
taste
and
a
nice
hoppy
feeling
there
is
also
some
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
like
the
broadside
better
poured
an
amber
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
subsided
nice
lacing
coated
the
glass
and
held
on
for
dear
life
smells
of
hops
herbs
and
malt
and
tastes
the
same
smooth
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
with
the
tiniest
hoppy
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
and
goes
down
wicked
easy
hey
i
like
it
boy
oh
boy
this
is
a
real
drinker
one
slug
and
i
have
to
declare
this
as
a
perfect
refresherdelicious
and
hard
to
put
down
the
glass
that
is
the
color
is
bright
and
kristal
clear
deep
amber
not
a
ton
of
head
but
real
nice
elegant
lace
patterns
emerge
aromas
are
clean
malty
and
decidedly
bitter
in
a
most
compelling
sort
of
way
the
mouthfeel
is
razor
sharpclean
as
a
whistle
ah
so
crisp
and
cleansing
this
is
a
delicious

i
love

here
is

for
me
everything

fade
in

a

mineral
flavors
and
chalkiness
noted
the
foretaste
makes
this
selection
a
great
companion
for
lobster
or
boiled
salt
potatoes
with
butter
a
wonderful
english
ale
it
is
copper
in
color
and
has
a
great
hoppy
aroma
that
makes
me
think
that
a
generous
amount
of
fuggles
were
used
the
smooth
creamy
body
is
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
it
is
balanced
very
well
and
finishes
with
some
bitterness
very
nice
for
a
low
abv
initial
smell
of
citrus
then
as
it
warmed
more
a
light

presence
was
evident

with
an
initially
nice
head
that
dissipated
into
just
a
bit
of

was
very
good
slight
maltly
sweetness
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
presence
that
linger
in

mouthfeel
was
not
watery

medium

very
easy
on

the

is
quite
bitter
with
a
malty
core
it
goes
down
smooth
with
a
dry

the

it

this
would
really
benefit
from
the

brings
as

make

wants
to
hunt
down
some
more
products
from
adnams
company
brewery
an
awesome
quaffer
and
a
very
very
nice
bitter
this
is
a
good
ale
to
have
when
youre
having
more
than
one
slightly
hazed
deep
amber
with
a
scarlet
red
accent
as
well
carbonation
is
visible
and
moderate
a
thin
wispy
beige

leaves
sparse
but
adequate
lace
nice
blend
of
floral
hops
herbal
earthy

and
slight
butter
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
great
almost
like
it
was
pulled
from
a
cask
creamy
and
dreamy
quite
easy
drinking
the
flavor
of
this
bitter
is
quite
appealing
as
well
a
little
fruity
some
botanicals
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
herbal
and
earthy
hop
tones
yeah
this
ones
a
keeper
adnams
makes
damn
good
beers
initially
disappointed
in
the
taste
which
was
lightly
of
caramel
to
begin
then
it
happened
a
charge
of
bitterness
that
never
let
go
chased
the
caramel
awaya
hop
heads
delight
my
compliments
to
the
brew
master
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
memorable
got
one
more
to
try
so
well
see
how
it
comes
up
on
the
second
go
around
a
session
beer
thats
got
everthing
on
its
side
easy
to
chug
down
this
brew
all
night
and
remain
thoroughly
satisfied
throughout
may
not
impress
straight
up
but
after
a
decent
inspection
sneaks
right
up
on
ya
in
terms
of
its
class
pouring
a
dull
and
orangehazed
chestnut
color
this
beer
displayed
nothing
else
but
some
carbonation
it
smelled
of
caramel
nuts
and
lots
of
grassy
hops
with
light
dried
flower
accents
fading
every
minute
tasted
of
a
soft
roasty
base
with
pleasant
bitter
twang
had
a
fruity
turn
to
the
earthiness
while
the
lingering
bitters
turn
and
change
constantly
but
never
pleasantly
so
strange
nutty
flavor
in
the
finish
too
a
decent
bitter
with
no
memorable
qualities
darn
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
offwhite
foam
the
head
retention
is
decent
and
it
slowly
drops
to
a
wide
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
some
spotty
lace
also
adds
to
its
appearance
the
nose
delivers
earthy
leafy
and
grassy
hops
fuggles
and
probably
some
goldings
with
a
pinch
of
yeasty
sulphur
thrown
in
over
a
caramelish
malt
its
firm
bodied
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
fine
and
natural
bottleconditioned
moderate
carbonation
that
gently
caresses
the
tongue
and
rouses
the
tastebuds
some
yeasty
fruitiness
that
wasnt
noticed
in
the
aroma
makes
an
appearance
in
the
flavor
followed
by
a
mellow
toffeeishcaramelbiscuity
malt
thats
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
and
peppered
with
a
leafy
hop
flavor
it
finishes
dry
with
some
residual
bitterness
that
leaves
the
palate
refreshed
and
ready
for
food
or
more
beer
simple
satisfying
refreshing
an
excellent
session
ale
i
liked
it
not
over
the
top
malty
then
hoppy
and
bitter
well
balanced
not
in
your
face
a
bit
nutty
and
oaky
another
solid
brew
from
adnams
whom
may
not
make
some
of
the
most
sought
after
brews
but
brew
some
very
solid
little
ales
which
i
like
them
for
well
done
adnams
o
horrid
example
of
an
esb
river
horse
needs
to
go
back
to
the
books
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
decent
flavorful
and
balanced
esb
nothing
to
mindblowing
but
quite
satifying
considering
the
abv
but
nothing
close
to
the
traditional
quality
english
examples
or
even
as
good
as
many
american
interpretations

toasted

with
a
bit
of

the

clearly
taking
control
medium

leaves
a
bit
of
a
film
in
the
mouth
but
still
fairly
drinkable
notes
my
overall
thought
is
that
it
may
not
be
the
prettiest
beer
but
it
has
some
good
flavor
notes
and
nice
balance

i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
then
a

of
these
at

abv

out
a

this
beer
has
virtually
no
head
on
it
the
pour
and
appearance
is
rather
boring
the
smell
is
mostly
caramel
malts
has
a
sweet
aroma
there
is
basically
no
hop
aroma
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
medium
really
not
much
else
to
brag
about
this
one
not
the
best
esb
out
there
o
somewhat
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
amazing
here
but
nothing
horrid
either
cheers
disappointed
in
a
brewery
im
usually
high
on
seems
like
a
poor
blend
of
malts
i
dont
know
if
its
old
or
what
not
a
fan
at
all
not
an
esb
at
all
i
suppose
this
is
drinkable
but
it
really
just
doesnt
ring
my
bell
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
very
good
one
either
tasty
good
drinnker
nice
ale
d
i
got
halfway
through
and
decided
enough
was
enough
12
drain
pour
d
nice
mild
flavors
and
low
abv
would
make
this
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
esb
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
one
that
i
would
try
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
such
a
thing
i
did
enjoy
it
more
than
the
ship
inn
esb
i
had
earlier
in
the
day
d
i
really
liked
the
body
on
this
one
but
with
almost
no
flavor
and
a
nightmare
pour
id
give
it
a
pass
everytime
redesigned
bottle
says
nothing
about
being
an
esb
pours
a
dark
amber
wich
looks
brown
at
certain
angles
small
head
that
fizzles
quickly
smell
throws
me
for
a
loop
since
i
was
expecting
an
american
amber
which
is
what
the
bottle
says
heavy
toffee
malts
with
some
toasted
grain
and
a
little
butterscotch
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
malt
forward
a
little
buttery
and
some
caramel
and
licorice
tastes
much
bigger
than
4
5
as
i
notice
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
a
little
chewy
went
down
easy
enough
but
im
glad
i
only
have
one
ok
i
can
see
where
these
guys
are
going
with
this
beer
theyre
trying
to
turn
a
classic
esb
into
a
fullflavored
american
amber
it
doesnt
work
the
body
is
too
thick
either
from
low
attenuation
or
possibly
and
too
much
crystal
malt
it
comes
off
with
a
thick
body
like
a
67
beer
which
sort
of
negates
the
sessionability
mouthfeel
aside
the
beer
tastes
like
toffee
malt
with
a
dash
of
herbal
citrus
hops
at
the
finish
so
even
for
all
that
unfermented
sugar
thickening
the
beer
it
doesnt
seem
terribly
complex
id
avoid
this
if
i
were
you
its
not
offensive
there
are
just
better
options
out
there
poured
a
midnight
copper
with
a
long
lasting
fluffy
head
looks
pretty
good
in
a
pint
glass
smell
is
average
at
best
nothing
to
write
home
about
has
a
caramel
taste
but
falls
a
little
flat
overall
nothing
really
jumps
out
about
this
beer
almost
like
you
really
have
to
search
for
its
character
in
the
end
though
its
not
that
bad
it
basically
comes
off
as
just
an
average
beer
to
me
river
horse
overdoes
it
more
often
than
not
hop
a
lot
a
mus
for
example
but
this
beer
does
the
opposite
it
doesnt
do
enough
the
finish
is
like
eating
an
actual
caramel
sticky
and
sweet
would
i
buy
this
again
no
but
would
i
say
its
crap
no
its
just
an
average
beer
md
carbonation
is
there
but
not
a
ton
pretty
average
mouthfeel
not
too
thin
not
really
silky
or
chewy
its
just
there
not
much
residual
sugar
which
when
coupled
with
its
balanced
flavor
and
low
abv
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
my
only
gripe
is
that
its
still
close
to
10
at
my
local
shop
rh
would
make
a
killing
if
they
could
undercut
other
craft
brews
a
pretty
good
beer
my
1st
from
this
brewer
sometimes
i
feel
like
i
expect
every
beer
to
be
a
huge
monster
of
a
beer
and
it
shouldnt
be
so
if
you
are
looking
for
a
huge
hop
bomb
this
isnt
it
but
in
every
way
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
its
just
unfortunate
that
i
picked
up
no
scent
at
all
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
clear
with
a
light
brown
color
there
was
a
large
head
of
small
offwhite
bubbles
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
rising
within
a
lot
of
bubbles
are
clinging
to
the
sides
and
bottom
of
the
glass
it
looks
as
though
it
is
over
carbonated
it
has
a
mild
hop
aroma
that
is
slightly
off
in
some
way
maybe
it
is
all
the
gas
coming
form
the
dissipating
head
that
is
influencing
the
smell
there
is
touch
of
hop
to
the
flavor
but
its
hardly
strong
enough
to
call
this
an
esb
otherwise
it
tastes
watery
and
slightly
piney
it
has
a
light
body
and
a
ton
of
carbonation
i
can
feel
bubbles
in
every
corner
of
my
mouth
there
is
a
little
coating
but
nothing
memorable
what
is
more
noticeable
is
the
feeling
my
stomach
has
with
all
of
this
gas
in
it
even
after
just
a
few
sips
im
afraid
this
beer
is
going
to
make
me
burp
a
few
times
all
of
this
carbonation
makes
this
glass
hard
to
finish
i
will
say
that
this
bottle
is
a
little
old
and
that
may
be
why
the
flavor
isnt
that
bitter
and
there
is
so
much
carbonation
i
dont
think
i
get
another
bottle
of
this
unless
i
knew
it
was
very
fresh
very
drinkable
with
a
low
abr
d
easy
to
drink
quenching
nothing
special
despite
name
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz

a

with
a
12
inch

malts

is
mostly
of
malts
some
hops
present
not
overly

overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent

my
reviews
river

has
never
released
what
i
would
consider
to
be
an
impressive

special

keeps
that
dubious
streak
alive
sorry
but
your
money
is
better
spent
elsewhere
drinkability
overall
a
very
drinkable
esb
i
like
the
notes
of
honey
like
sweetness
and
caramel
in
here
they
really
smooth
things
out
at
4
5
its
very
drinkable
and
east
to
throw
back
a
few
a
good
offering
from
a
very
solid
brewery
pours
a
dark
amber
that
would
be
pretty
clear
if
there
wasnt
so
much
sediment
floating
around
and
seriously
theres
a
lot
of
sediment
if
i
swirl
the
glass
it
moves
as
if
trapped
in
jello
the
head
is
big
and
frothy
and
leaves
behind
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
melon
caramel
and
something
thats
indescribable
like
that
smell
of
clean
when
you
walk
into
a
walmart
the
taste
is
again
very
sweet
theres
caramel
honey
light
fruits
and
theres
that
clean
feeling
again
its
actually
reminding
me
of
a
really
crisp
apple
when
you
first
bite
into
the
skin
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
acidic
but
pretty
smooth
overall
im
puzzled
by
the
lessthanaverage
reviews
of
this
beer
i
really
liked
it
even
though
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
any
esb
ive
ever
had
maybe
its
that
mysterious
crispness
that
makes
me
enjoy
it
so
much
wait
a
minute
after
a
second
glass
i
figured
it
out
apple
crispness
caramel
malt
it
tastes
like
a
candy

a
darn
solid

right
here

a

some

of
one
of

canned

i

its

i
will
have
to
pass
on
this
one
drink
is
decent
a
good
beer
to
try
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
moderate
white
head
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
grassy
the
beer
is
a
bit
sweet
on
the
palate
nothing
real
complex
the
bottle
is
right
it
almost
taste
like
it
has
honey
in
it
the
beer
is
a
light
bodied
session
beer
that
is
very
easily
drinkable
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
the
crispness
is
refreshing
and
a
slight
muskiness
of
the
sweet
malts
did
well
to
balance
the
beer
later
on
from
the
sampler
pack
from
perfect
pour
of
course
poured
a
soft
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
of
foam
that
fell
quickly
but
left
a
nice
lacing
of
foam
all
the
way
down
a
touch
more
carbonation
than
expected
but
a
nicely
drinkable
mouthfeel
mild
biscuity
malt
flavor
with
a
subtle
malt
bitterness
to
round
out
the
flavor
profile
no
strange
aftertastes
and
was
easily
quaffed
even
after
it
warmed
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
nothing
fancy
just
flavorful
and
refreshing
overall
no
insult
but
cant
think
of
something
more
to
say
either
wayworks
as
the
twelvepack
filler
with
a
sessionable
sweetness
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
though
i
think
it
could
be
a
bit
bolder
without
sacrificing
drinkability
otherwise
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
pretty
drinkable
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
a
tasty
highly
drinkable
brew
medium
body
feel
starts
out
creamy
then
is
broken
up
by
the
lively
carbonation
decently
smooth
although
its
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
it
all
overall
a
decent
esb
not
something
i
would
search
out
the
feel
aftertaste
and
lingering
impression
of
river
horse
special
ale
esb
is
like
cotton
candy
sticky
sweet
and
not
so
special
d
very
low
abv
and
not
much
extreme
flavor
going
on
very
good
session
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
carbonation
is
well
to
do
but
that
alone
wont
help
me
finish
this
the
pale
is
a
so
much
better
sessioner
then
this
weak
reach
around
not
really
offensive
but
just
impossiblefor
me
at
least
probably
could
waste
the
rest
of
this
on
an
orange
glaze
for
some
chicken
though
i
feel
slightly
seduced
by
this
beer
its
like
the
hot
girlfriend
i
never
had
every
time
you
take
asip
you
get
a
nice
forthy
head
back
on
top
it
doesnt
taste
like
hop
soda
like
a
lot
of
american
craft
beers
and
doesnt
have
the
consistency
of
diet
coke
this
is
a
real
beer
with
some
real
flavors
will
definitely
pick
up
some
more
later
pours
a
lightly
hazed
copper
with
a
mediumsmall

husky
grain
and
some

fairly
dry
in
flavour
with
a
light
toast
and
some
faint
herbal
notes

in

but
not
overcarbonated
and
finishes
fairly
cleanly
good
sessionable
ale
orange
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading

aroma
is
malty
taste
is
malty
with
a
bready
aftertaste
overall
theres
not
much
going
on
its
kind
of
bland
and
boring
this
is
where
you
can
use
the
term
run
of
the
mill
i
wouldnt
waste
my
time
with
another
one
nor
would
i
waste
anybody
elses
time
by
recommending
it
d
low
abv
and
carbonation
make
this
highly
drinkable
although
the
metallic
taste
is
a
little
off
putting
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
exciting
im
guessing
this
is
not
what
they
were
going
for
its
got
a
distinct
lemony
funk
to
it
but
with
nothing
else
going
on
this
beer
it
is
not
pleasant
kind
of
an
off
weird
tasting
beer
that
has
little
to
no
hop
flavor
and
on
the
lighter
watery
side
drinkability
a
decent
esb
not
necessarily
the
best
but
also
not
terrible
its
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
worth
a
one
time
shot
but
probably
wont
blow
you
away
to
crazily
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
certainly
a
decent
option
as
a
session
beer
but
for
the
price
better
could
be
found
for
my
own
preference
pours
a
hazy
brown
orange
color
with
a
small
screen
of
a
white
head
some
soapy
sticking
sweet
bready
malts
in
the
nose
with
a
spicy
hop
character
the
beers
malt
character
over
powers
the
semibitter
hop
character
it
has
going
on
a
good
and
welcomed
hop
bite
just
before
the
finish
although
not
true
to
the
esb
style
this
ale
remains
light
drinkable
and
some
what
refreshing
a
well
balanced
beer
i
like
a
few
river
horse
beers
this
is
not
one
of
them
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
head
and
lots
of
sediment
smell
reminds
me
of
the
essence
of
a
watermelon
sucker
with
a
tootsie
roll
in
the
middle
it
doesnt
smell
beerlike
at
all
no
trace
of
hops
tastes
not
at
all
like
and
esb
in
fact
it
hardly
tastes
like
a
beer
at
all
cloying
malts
and
overyeastiness
is
not
tasty
to
me
in
the
slightest
i
hope
that
rh
either
reworks
this
beer
or
else
scraps
it
because
i
know
from
other
styles
that
they
are
able
to
make
some
pretty
good
beer
this
poured
a
hazy
honey
color
with
tons
of
offwhite
head
foamed
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
it
smelled
like
polished
copper
and
grass
and
lemon
hops
with
fresh
wheat
and
dusty
barley
it
tasted
like
copper
and
wild
yeast
and
lemon
hops
with
some
barley
it
was
watery
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
super
fizzy
beer
that
had
decent
flavor
but
was
pretty
bland
it
was
tough
to
enjoy
or
critique
through
all
the
carbonation
im
not
a
fan
this
brew
is
just
boring
and
while
it
was
really
great
looking
it
was
a
lot
like
a
hot
babe
with
a
great
rack
and
no
brains

i

during
the
holiday
leave
block
we
all
said
we
would
bring
back
a
six
pack
from
the
state
we
were
taking
leave
in
this
was
my
selection
after
reading
some
mediocre
reviews
i
decided
to
test
it
i
wish
i
bought
the
oatmeal
stout
instead
the
appearance
is
the
only
thing
good
about
this
beer
it
pours
a
bright
gold
to
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
head
ample
lacing
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
i
dont
get
too
much
in
the
aroma
maybe
a
little
grainyness
and
no
real
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
the
same
a
little
malt
sweetness
but
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
weird
drying
happenning
to
my
mouth
i
guess
it
has
drinkability
due
to
its
light
nature
but
the
flavor
is
not
there
i
would
rather
spend
a
dollar
or
two
less
and
get
yuengling
if
i
am
looking
for
something
light
and
quaffable
looks
like
i
am
going
to
have
to
purchase
something
else
because
i
am
not
giving
this
to
my
students
d
average
mid
atlantic
esb
not
a
terrible
beer
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
clean
drinkable
and
subtle
with
its
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
water
shares
a
few
of
these
attributes
as
well
i
could
have
stood
a
bit
more
spiciness
and
bitter
english
malts
but
instead
was
left
with
a
mediocre
esb
all
in
all
its
worth
a
try
full
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
aromas
fruity
malty
and
slightly
nutty
with

tastes
totally

going

more
on

with
a
slight

medium

and
a
great
u
s
copy
of
a

k
style
not
for
american
craft
lovers
of
hoptown
d
may
make
a
good
session
beer
for
some
but
its
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
have
again
i
like
this
beer
and
i
also
dont
really
care
for
it
at
the
same
time
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
a
good
presence
pours
a
nice
pale
amber
color
but
even
while
dumping
the
beer
straight
into
my
glass
i
couldnt
get
a
decent
head
to
form
and
there
is
very
little
lacing
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
full
but
watery
in
the
end
solid
malt
here
rather
sweet
for
an
esb
caramel
and
a
honey
flavor
are
dominant
its
tasty
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
decent
but
lacking
this
ale
has
bee
with
river
horse
since
the
beginning
of
the
brewery
in
1996
ample
quantities
of
caramel
malt
give
this
english
ale
a
soft
copper
colour
and
the
addition
of
carapils
adds
tghe
sweetness
you
might
mistake
for
honey
low
bitterness
combines
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
not
a
bad
brew
the
feel
is
thick
almost
like
a
cream
ale
full
bodied
its
a
drinkable
special
ale
they
call
it
an
esb
but
its
far
stronger
nice
and
substantial
nothing
to
write
home
about
tmd
some
sparse
flavours
lacking
the
smooth
maltiness
often
associated
with
the
style
a
touch
of
citrus
zing
but
fairly
watery
both
in
flavour
and
body
consistency
a
moderate
carbonation
offers
some
added
life
to
keep
things
interesting
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
unfortunately
and
the
brew
ends
up
a
little
boring
and
the
experience
uneventful
spot
on
and
eversotasty
with
a
great
aesthetic
to
the
label
this
smells
beter
than
it
acualy
tastes
it
is
a
nice
amber
color
and
pours
with
minimal
head
this
is
a
little
sweet
then
bland
than
a
hop
kiss
this
one
is
avarage
its
beter
than
any
macro
brew
budwiser
but
its
nouthing
special
i
gess
that
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
taste
pours
a
nice
amber
color
mostly
clear
with
a
short
lived
white
head
smell
is
fruity
nutty
and
toffee
like
with
light
chocolate
really
nice
for
an
esb
taste
is
lightly
chocolatey
with
toffee
and
some
pecan
like
flavor
and
fruity
tones
richer
than
expected
and
much
better
that
the
ratings
indicate
i
liked
this
one
d
solid
but
unspectacular
a
nice
brew
worthy
of
consideration
but
not
one
to
be
sought
out
or
reverred
d
decent
drinkability
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
option
not
sure
it
was
true
to
style
when
poured
into
a
flying
fish
standard
pint
glass
this
river
horse
is
a
clear
copper
orange
with
a
miniature
head
of
white
fizzy
bubbles
these
bubbles
quickly
fizzled
away
that
had
to
be
somewhere
else
when
they
fizzled
away
they
only
left
behind
5
to
8
fizzy
rings
along
the
edge
and
no
lace
not
even
one
spot
of
lace
it
had
a
very
crispy
and
dry
aroma
of
floarl
hops
a
drop
of
perfume
subtle
lemon
and
grapefruit
and
then
it
finished
up
with
a
small
touch
of
toffee
the
taste
of
this
esb
was
more
dry
than
hoppy
and
featured
lightly
hoppy
floral
hops
a
smidge
of
toasted
malts
and
ended
just
like
the
aroma
did
with
a
small
touch
of
toffee
the
mouthfeel
feel
was
light
and
crispy
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
faint
aftertaste
of
grapefruit
and
toffee
sometimes
the
carbonation
was
so
loud
that
it
covered
up
what
little
taste
this
beer
had
in
the
end
its
just
another
average
decent
ale
from
river
horse
08
long
island
brew
festival
poured
into
heffe
glass
the
color
was
beautiful
caramel
with
dark
red
accents
a
somewhat
disappointing
small
head
which
faded
into
a
cap
quickly
almost
no
lacing
the
taste
was
low
sweetness
and
mouthfeel
was
very
light
pleasant
experience
overall
and
would
recommend
as
a
nice
starter
a
12
ounce
bottle
of
river
horse
esb
poured
into
a
pint
glass
revealed
a
fairly
attractive
dark
amber
ale
with
a
nice
appropriate
head
the
aroma
was
very
light
but
i
think
there
was
some
barely
detectable
hints
of
grain
and
a
smaller
hint
of
hops
nice
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
fairly
light
bodied
the
flavor
was
similar
to
the
aroma
mainly
grain
with
almost
no
hops
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
not
a
standout
but
a
nice
beer
this
beer
looked
a
little
better
then
it
tasted
after
taking
a
few
sniffs
i
didnt
pull
a
whole
lot
very
light
hops
and
a
little
grain
aroma
the
taste
was
light
and
not
a
whole
lot
to
it
as
well
it
didnt
taste
bad
there
just
wasnt
a
lot
of
content
there
was
slim
not
of
bitterness
when
it
warmed
up
usually
from
a
extra
special
bitter
i
tend
to
expect
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
over
all
i
just
think
its
a
light
copper
ale
pours
a
decent
copper
with
a
touch
of
chill
haze
not
much
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
extremely
light
but
with
a
touch
of
metal
and
dry
malt
taste
isnt
bad
clean
slightly
metallic
very
slight
hint
of
dry
malt
touch
of
bakers
chocolate
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
pretty
drinkable
session
beer
not
very
alcoholic
fairly
lightly
flavored
and
clean
but
with
a
touch
of
decent
flavor
not
my
favorite
but
i
wouldnt
complain
if
this
was
a
fallback
at
a
bar
with
mostly
bmc
d
coud
be
a
good
session
beer
at
4
5
abv
but
more
flavor
would
be
nice
drinks
slow
too
astringent
not
sure
how
long
this
one
was
sitting
in
a
fridge
in
that
store
but
this
failed
to
impress
makes
me
hesitant
to
try
anything
else
from
these
guys
this
really
reminds
me
of
one
of
my
first
crappy
batches
of
homebrew
avoid
i
understand
that
styles
are
open
to
interpretation
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
its
not
very
good
esb
or
not
it
does
have
something
a
lightness
about
it
perhaps
or
a
mildness
that
doesnt
make
it
drain
pour
but
it
comes
pretty
close
taste
was
not
much
there
everysofaint
hops
presence
and
kinda
flabby
malt
flavor
that
gave
a
kind
of
sourish
finish
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
watery
at
least
the
carbonation
was
ok
have
i
been
drinking
so
much
dfh
that
ive
burned
out
my
taste
buds
i
dont
think
so
this
is
just
kinda
ordinary
beer
like
the
rating
says
not
impressed
one
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
there
wasnt
anything
good
around
and
it
would
be
better
than
bmc
but
not
much
i
got
this
esb
in
a
varietypack
case
a
pennsylvania
special
would
never
have
tried
the
stuff
if
not
for
wanting
to
get
some
of
the
hop
hazard
this
stuff
is
a
nohop
hazard
drinkability
not
bad
the
weird
aroma
and
uber
sweet
characteristics
of
this
brew
are
amongst
the
reasons
i
hadnt
sampled
a
river
horse
brew
in
quite
some
time
until
recently
their
limited
amount
of
seasonalsspecial
beers
are
pretty
good
to
very
good
but
the
regular
lineup
has
always
seemed
to
be
littered
with
various
problems
cant
really
recommend
this
one
not
one
i
will
buy
again
pours
a
lightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
of
medium
off
white
bubbles
aroma
is
sour
smell
reminds
me
of
a
flemish
red
taste
is
watery
with
a
mild
sourness
in
the
background
sourness
and
some
bitterness
linger
long
into
a
dry
aftertaste
interesting
just
about
the
farthest
thing
from
the
esb
i
was
expecting
you
will
be
massively
disappointed
with
this
as
an
esb
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
bit
of
sourness
this
is
ok
the
flavor
was
slightly
dissapointing
it
was
neither
pronounced
nor
subtle
in
other
words
it
wasnt
there
you
could
easily
sense
the
sweet
undertones
but
it
was
very
impossible
to
identify
any
flavors
per
se
this
ale
has
such
a
light
body
and
feels
just
like
water
especially
right
after
you
swallowed
it
i
had
part
of
this
ale
with
blueberry
waffles
and
ended
up
appreciating
it
a
little
bit
more
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
ale
anything
but
slightly
above
average
so
much
for
it
being
the
flagship
ale
of
river
horse
cheers
this
one
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
very
watery
taste
with
no
real
malt
or
hop
surge
to
be
found
definitely
has
hints
of
honey
the
smell
became
worse
after
each
sip
to
the
point
of
a
vinegar
like
smell
i
definitely
would
call
this
an
esb
and
there
is
really
nothing
special
about
it
i
will
say
it
is
drinkable
mainly
because
it
is
so
light
a
pretty
weak
effort
overall
glad
i
only
purchased
a
single
bottle
i
wont
revisit
this
one
again
this
isnt
a
horrible
effort
but
needs
to
focus
the
aim
and
produce
a
unifying
taste
that
can
be
strengthened
by
continual
repetition
this
is
just
not
quite
right
however
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
worth
taking
a
flyer
on
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
i
would
certainly
drink
if
i
was
offered
one
i
wouldnt
buy
it
a
previous
review
sums
this
beer
up
perfectly
forgettable
this
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
amber
with
a
very
small
short
lived
head
the
smell
is
average
with
some
roasted
maltbut
thats
about
it
the
taste
has
some
roasted
malt
nuttiness
and
a
slight
citrus
aftertaste
the
mf
is
light
and
leaves
your
mouth
a
little
watery
this
is
an
average
beer
and
i
doubt
ill
try
this
again
river
horse
poured
a
hazy
red
which
i
found
as
a
positive
sign
as
it
means
the
beer
was
not
filtered
the
head
was
a
good
white
color
but
faded
half
way
through
the
beer
the
smell
was
very
malty
with
a
sight
caramel
note
a
fruity
hop
nose
complemented
the
sweetness
the
taste
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
i
expect
a
pronounced
hop
character
in
an
esb
but
i
did
not
find
it
here
the
mouth
feel
was
good
a
nice
bodied
beer
special
ale
is
a
good
drinking
beer
but
the
sweetness
of
it
limits
me
to
only
one
or
two
in
a
session
definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
know
about
buying
it
case
after
case
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
beige
head
above
the
mostly
clear
copper
brew
head
settles
down
a
layer
of
foam
with
nice
lacing
aroma
is
almost
sickly
sweet
for
the
style
little
evidence
of
hops
taste
unfortunately
continues
along
this
road
somewhat
corny
sweetness
with
the
slightest
of
bitterness
not
even
close
to
doing
its
job
of
balancing
or
more
here
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
but
the
sweetness
just
puts
a
damper
on
the
whole
experience
pours
deep
orange
with
a
small
white
head
its
hazy
and
cloudy
apparently
unfiltered
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
but
whats
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
strange
soapy
note
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
underwhelming
theres
not
much
there
past
a
vague
malty
sweetness
hops
seem
nonexistent
it
finishes
like
it
starts
theres
a
serious
lack
of
flavor
here
this
is
clearly
a
crossover
beer
but
i
think
it
fails
at
even
that
there
isnt
very
much
taste
and
whats
there
isnt
terribly
interesting
or
appealing
upon
its
emergence
from
the
botlle
the
beer
presented
itself
as
a
deep
amber
liquid
with
boisterous
white
puffy
head
that
fell
to
a
chunky
coating
that
refused
to
leave
the
aroma
is
a
toasty
sweetness
that
was
immensely
pleasureable
to
the
nose
where
is
the
taste
i
can
detect
a
slight
presence
of
malt
but
i
feel
its
really
trying
to
hide
finish
is
sweet
and
a
bit
dry
but
reallly
is
unremarkable
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
because
there
flavor
was
so
light
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
vintage
cellar
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
but
theres
nothing
truly
outstanding
here
the
metallic
taste
fades
away
after
about
half
a
bottle
i
could
definitely
drink
this
one
all
night
i
hardly
noticed
that
i
was
almost
finished
with
the
second
beer
almost
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
this
reminds
me
of
a
hundred
other
forgettable
ales
that
wont
make
you
sick
and
can
be
had
again
and
again
and
again
and
well
you
get
the
idea
im
surprised
at
how
low
this
beer
is
rated
its
really
drinkable
and
pleasant
granted
its
not
interesting
or
provocative
but
not
all
beers
can
be
or
should
be
this
is
a
textbook
session
ale
overall
eh
pretty
weak
especially
to
call
itself
an
esb

i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
fairly
well
just
not
sure
if
you
were
looking
for
a
standard
esb
if
this
would
fit
also
not
being
overly
versed
in
the
style
maybe
the
offerings
ive
had
are
a
bit
more
heavy
on
the
bitter
than
expected
bitter
too
much
for
me
and
i
like
heavy
seas
not
this
one
the
feel
is
a
bit
abrasive
and
bitter
on
cask
at
rattle
n

nyc
great
well
rounded
flavor
a
touch
of
the
bitter
but
all
in
a
great
pour
as
with
most
cask
presented
brews
there
is
not
much
head
or
lacing
but
the
flavor
is
there
it
is
unquestoinably
an
ale
so
hop
heads
take
heed
different
very
interesting
it
starts
off
very
pleasant
with
a
malty
taste
that
quickly
goes
into
a
caramel
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
very
very
bitter
and
keeping
my
liking
of
the
beer
at
a

i
was
not
crazy
about
this
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
with
what
looked
to
be
something
like
yeast
floating
as
thick
as
a
snow
glob
taste
was

with
a
alcohol

taste
over
all
a
poor
beer
pouring

color
leaning
into

winter
storm
gives
an
initial
top
note
of
hops
as
it
opens
up
theres
elements
of
orange
peel
subtle
woodsy
notes
and
elements
of
cacao
theres
just
the
slightest
trace
of
bread
on
the
palate
it
starts
bright
slightly
bitter
with
flavors
of
citrus
pine
and
an
earthiness
thats
almost
slightly
herbal
the
hop
flavors
are
plentiful
the
but
the
malt
plays
back
up
with
notes
of
subtle
biscuit
burnt
sugar
and
toast
the
body
is
thick
noticeably
carbonated
bright
and
focused
on
hops
leaning
into
the
bitter
side
of
the
spectrum
the
ending
comes
alive
has
elements
of
unlit
mild
cigars
dried
herbal
notes
bread
burnt
sugar
and
hits
of
citrus
pith
the
finish
is
long
and
complex
o
a
little
hoppier
that
your
average
esb
which
makes
me
happy
had
beer
on
tap
was
good
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
a
lot
more
than
i
did
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
behind
it
is
a
bit
on
the
boozy
side
for
an
esb
and
has
a
strong
caramel
aftertaste
that
just
doesnt
work
for
me
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
overly
bitter
and
very
bright
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
esb
style
beers
so
this
review
may
need
to
be
tweaked
a
bit
over
time
as
i
taste
more
o
an
interesting
take
on
an
esb
much
hoppier
than
any
of
the
others
that
i
have
tried
slightly
too
much
alcohol
and
that
alcohol
is
not
well
enough
hidden
for
me
probably
would
not
grab
another
one
of
these
but
it
can
definitely
be
enjoyed

slightly

esb
o
decent

id
drink
another
one
o

definitely
one
you
want
to
drink
quickly
and
not
age
as
7
5
is
a
bit
under
the
abv
for
aging
and
due
to
the
hop
content
will
definitely
oxidize
in
6
months
or
so
i
look
forward
to
next
year
for
this
seasonal
like
most
heavy
seas
offerings
it
was
underwhelming
overall
very
good
a
gray
companion
to
a
winter
stew
exhibiting
great
malt
character
some
delicious
spices
and
a
fitter
finish
this
is
a
great
rendition
of
of
an
esb
bold
enough
to
be
set
as
their
winter
seasonal
pours
a
nice
medium
amber
with
red
hue
that
has
a
nice
head
that
laces
and
retains
well
nice
light
nose
of
biscuit
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
balanced
flavor
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
bitterness
against
a
mild
hop
flavor
which
i
believe
is
east
kent
goldings
finishes
clean
with
malt
sweetness
followed
by
the
bitters
my
first
sampling
of
heavy
seas
products
and
this
one
outstanding
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
winter
warmers
that
is
expertly
done
i
forgot
about
this
one
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
light
reddish
color
body
with
a
cc
full
2white
head
the
was
of
dark
fruits
and
malt
the
taste
has
some
dark
fruit
notes
and
caramel
to
it
the
malt
comes
in
on
the
tail
end
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
overall
it
is
ok
beer
just
not
my
style
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
what
id
expect
from
an
imperial
esb
let
it
warm
up
and
flatten
a
bit
before
drinking
however
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wished
for
more
focus
on
the
esb
aspects
of
the
beer
o
its
nice
to
have
your
expectations
met
before
reviewing
this
i
thought
meh
esb
and
after
finishing
this
i
thought
meh
esb
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
this
one
but
thats
due
to
my
dislike
of
the
style
forgot
i
had
this
one
in
the
fridge
decide
to
crack
it
open

this
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
but
id
much
prefer
a
fullers
esb
which
is
fruitier
less
hoppy
and
easier
to
drink
with
that
distinct
orange
marmalade
and
toast
flavor
that
i
love
in
wellcrafted
esbs
o
decent
brew
not
my
favorite
heavy

brew
but
worthy
of
a
try
pours
a
darker

with
a
decent

at

decent

retention
and
good

aroma
is

and

syrup
taste
is
sweet
again
darker
malts
and
syrup
present
starts
sweet
and
finishes
on
a
slightly
bitter
note
but
not
over
powering
for
those
that
like
milder
hops
great
beer
for
a
cold
day
the
taste
begins
mildly
sweet
with
a
balanced
but
slight
hop
bitterness
kicking
in
to
round
things
off
like
the
aroma
there
is
an
array
of
dark
malts
and
dark
fruits
showing
up
in
the
flavor
quite
nice
and
authentic
to
a
strong
british
bitter
overall
id
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
with
all
the
stouts
and
porter
flooding
the
market
during
the
winter
months
its
nice
to
find
something
a
little
lighter
this
opens
up
the
window
for
a
good
winter
drinking
session
with
some
buddies
certainly
not
on
par
with
their
loose
cannon
but
regardless
heavy
seas
has
impressed
me
yet
again
touche
hs
o
good
beer
having
had
this
beer
before
i
know
it
has
shown
better
than
this
bottle
overall
ok
but
not
great
not
my
fav
style
although
this
shies
away
from
the
over
herbal
vegetal
grassy
hops
i
really
dont
like
in
most
esbs
its
quite
bitter
and
a
nice
malty
balance
though
although
it
does
get
a
bit
too
sweet
but
overall
done
pretty
well
lovely
clear
rusty
color
with
a
light
khaki
head
nose
is
bready
with
a
healthy
dose
of
what
smells
like
maris
otter
malt
a
melange
of
spices
to
compliment
the
malt
body
alcohol
esters
and
english
fruitiness
taste
is
caramel
malt
sweet
with
a
toasted
light
and
roasted
dark
grain
compliment
holiday
spices
abound
and
flow
into
the
alcohol
edge
big
hops
show
here
and
give
an
earthy
dry
finish
that
has
a
good
amount
of
grapefruit
feel
is
velvety
and
lightly
chewy
creamy
carbonation
makes
this
on
highly
drinkable
a
superb
winter
ale
a
good
worthy
brew
overall
a
pretty
bitter
brew
sweet
initially
then
boozy
and
bitter
the
hop
character
adds
a
little
intrigue
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
esb
on
its
own
but
the
use
of
citrus
hops
makes
it
unique
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
overall
a
nice
winter
interpretation
of
the
esb
style
definitely
wellbalanced
between
earthy
hops
and
caramelchocolate
malts
certainly
something
id
have
again
and
recommend
to
others
beer
is
medium
bodied
it
doesnt
coat
the
mouth
or
tongue
has
a
dry
finish
over
all
i
have
to
say
this
esb
is
delicious
big
malty
and
spicy
flavor
with
no
spice
added
i
love
esbs
and
this
brew
is
at
the
top
of
my
list
overall
i
really
enjoy
a
high
quality
esb
but
unfortunately
this
just
was
not
one
of
them
there
is
an
overly
assertive
minerally
alcohol
dryness
that
overwhelms
the
flavor
profile
the
hops
are
also
too
american
for
the
style
comes
across
as
a
muddled
ipa
overall
decent
a
different
kind
of
winter
beer
compaired
to
everything
else
that
comes
out
its
flavorful
and
a
nice
mix
of
bitter
hoppy
and
sweet
malty
alcohol
is
minor
in
each
drink
the
spices
really
are
strong
and
stand
out
nice
change
of
pace
worth
a
drink
o
a
decent
sit
around
the
fire
fall
brew
flat
on
the
tongue
and
nothing
very
special
about
this
brew
bitter
as
it
should
be
but
the
nose
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
all
very
underwhelming
poured
into
dfh
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
deep
reddish
amber
with
desne
micro
bubbles
up
top
and
a
coating
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
skews
in
the
direction
of
herbal
with
notes
of
spruce
pine
and
molasses
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
more
molasses
and
spruce
the
sweetness
doesnt
give
way
to
any
bitterness
and
is
very
sweet
all
the
way
to
the
finish
not
really
getting
the
esb
quality
here
this
tastes
much
more
like
a
winter
warmer
which
is
what
the
name
implies
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
heavy
overall
i
dont
feel
that
this
qualifies
as
an
esb
and
it
definitely
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
i
would
pass
on
this
originally
reviewed
11302011
overall
i
guess
its
not
really
an
esb
but
its
still
a
pretty
good
beer
and
better
than
expected
heavy

and
has
the
smell
of

this
one
came
in
a
heavy

sampler
pack
i
picked
up
sometime
in
march
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hop
overtone
there
is
also
raisins
and
molasses
in
the
mix
a
good
tasting
beer
to
be
sure
may
be
a
tad
sweet
for
me
very
nice
approachable
interpretation
of
the
esb
which
i
normally
cant
stand
at
least
in
its
macro
version
found
in
europe
this
is
my
second
product
from
this
heavy

line
both
are
good
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
o

a
quality

served
from

into
a

tumbler
poured
a
dark
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
nutty
wheat
alcohol
perfume
and
bitter
hops
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
i
really
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
there
was
something
about
the
combination
of
the
flavors
going
on
in
this
one
that
really
turned
it
off
to
my
palate
i
even
let
others
try
it
and
they
agreed
that
something
was
off
on
the
flavor
of
this
one
that
wasnt
very
palate
pleasing
glad
i
finally
got
to
tick
it
but
doubt
i
will
be
having
it
again
overall
this
is
a
very
creative
and
effective
approach
to
a
winter
beer
overall
absolutely
appropriate
as
a
winter
offering
nothing
too
inspiring
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
what
is
an
imperial
esb
a
barleywine
junior
o
easy
drinking
good
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
i
dont
think
id
get
it
again
not
a
huge
esb
fan
final
thoughts
very
simple
but
pretty
nice
the
nose
was
a
little
light
and
the
beer
itself
is
more
hop
forward
then
what
i
would
consider
perfect
for
a
esb
but
on
the
whole
a
very
simple
but
good
brew
what
a
great
appearance
worth
a
buy
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
looking
amber
color
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
bitter
aroma
at
all
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
interesting
i
felt
like
i
was
getting
hints
of
pine
in
there
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
basically
normal
not
anything
that
really
impressed
me
on
that
level
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
i
think
its
one
that
id
try
again
just
to
give
it
another
go
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
the
hop
department
but
overall
its
a
pretty
tasty
beer
kind
of
forgettable
however
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
am
thrilled
i
got
to
try
on
cask
will
definitely
seek
out
again
overall
a
nice
beer
a
nice
strong
esb
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
this
brewery
overall
this
mustve
been
a
tough
beer
to
capture
but
clipper
city
nailed
it
really
tasty
refreshing
stuff
one
of
their
best
seasonals
the
body
is
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
crispness
is
light
up
front
and
a
bit
of
a
gentle
smoothness
picks
up
for
such
a
delicious
beer
i
do
wish
it
flowed
a
little
better
its
not
flat
by
any
means
but
does
seem
to
lay
down
just
a
bit
when
it
could
be
more
interesting
overall
it
is
a
bit
too
bold
for
a
bitter
in
my
book
still
a
fairly
pleasant
winter
drink
overall
taste
says
it
all
i
love
this
beer
any
shortcoming
are
made
up
by
the
taste
and
i
cant
rate
this
any
lower
overall
without
kidding
myself
heavy

category
5
ale
is
a
crystal
clear
and
very
sparkling
copper
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
off
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
a
sweet
grainy
bready
raisin
aroma
is
kind
if
muffled
by
the
head
the
soft
smooth
full
body
has
a
bone
dry
finish
its
creamy
a
spicy
bitterness
is
at
the
front
first
like
juniper
and
then
like
wood
resin
theres
a
slight
baklava
sweetness
lingering
but
the
bitterness
keeps
it
opressed
this
is
a
big
burly
beer
good
stuff
overall
well
crafted
just
what
i
would
expect
for
an
extra
special
bitter
to
sip
on
during
a
cold
winter
day
locked
inside
the
house
try
it
with
some
dark
smoked
meats
o
a
little
too
disjointed
for
me
some
nice
characteristics
but
they
fail
to
play
nicely
together
and
leave
me
searching
too
hard
for
the
highlights
o
this
beer
looked
fantastic
and
had
a
great
nose
taste
was
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
close
to
a
tie
between
this
and
gritty
mcduffs
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
it
was
smooth
and
the
beer
seemed
a
bit
under
carbonated
but
i
suppose
that
is
more
typical
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
average
esb
that
really
didnt
interest
me
that
much
the
flavor
was
heavy
on
the
malts
the
malt
profile
wasnt
bad
it
just
needed
more
hops
to
balance
it
out
and
it
needed
more
bitterness
i
could
probably
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
dull
and
doesnt
hold
my
attention
so
i
doubt
i
would
want
to
drink
more
then
one
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
spot
on
for
an
esb
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
hops
in
this
beer
the
aroma
and
taste
could
have
benefited
from
more
hops
the
malts
are
just
too
dominating
for
an
esb
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
much
rather
have
saugatucks
or
shorts
esb
if
your
a
big
fan
of
esbs
you
may
find
this
beer
disappointing
but
if
you
like
malty
beers
this
may
be
worth
a
try
i
havent
had
a
whole
lot
of
experience
with
esbs
but
the
ones
i
have
had
had
a
much
better
hop
presence
and
thats
where
this
beer
was
lacking
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
it
seems
like
i
have
much
better
luck
with
the
mutiny
fleet
instead
of
the
smaller
format
bottles
a
pretty
meh
beer
and
so
far
my
least
favorite
esb
i
am
starting
to
think
that
the
better
beers
from
clipper
city
come
in
the
mutiny
fleet
since
i
have
yet
to
be
impressed
by
their
12oz
bottles
not
your
average
winter
seasonal
im
not
so
sure
it
really
gets
me
in
the
mood
for
a
winter
storm
but
in
and
of
itself
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
not
really
as
balanced
as
an
esb
typically
might
be
but
its
got
an
interesting
interplay
between
flavors
recommended
to
try
at
least
once
jh
m
firm
robust
and
yet
delicate
the
superb
hop
highlights
add
another
dimension
to
both
flavour
and
feel
adding
dryness
to
complement
the
carbonation
o
this
seems
to
be
a
recurring
theme
with
most
of
the
heavy
seas
brews
they
have
great
ideas
for
beers
but
dont
execute
them
well
imho
their
two
cannon
beers
are
the
best
things
theyve
done
and
the
rest
is
just
eh
wins
points
for
the
pleasant
aroma
but
other
than
that
just
another
dud
overall
a
nice
beer
not
one
i
would
kill
myself
trying
to
get
a
hold
of
but
does
not
disappoint
either
this
is
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
pretty
good
and
definitely
does
what
it
set
out
to
do
whoever
heard
of
an
imperial
esb
we
did
a
large
christmas
and
winter
beer
tasting
panel
and
this
was
one
of
the
many
that
we
tried
most
of
the
beers
we
tried
we
solid
including
this
one
that
the
panel
liked
i
havent
acutally
had
a
real
one
in
some
time
this
one
is
strong
and
sweet
and
full
and
mild
i
like
it
a
lot
good
strong
ale
i
would
say
get
some
and
have
a
taste
o
pleasantly
suprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
m
good
carbonation
medium
body
less
smooth
than
desired
spot
on
try
this
treat
d
defiantly
a
beer
that
you
want
to
let
warm
as
you
drink
it
so
the
experience
changes
a
sipper
for
sure
final
thoughtsoverall
i
really
like
this
i
think
its
something
youd
again
only
have
a
couple
of
but
it
really
is
worth
trying
though
if
you
drink
lighter
beers
the
taste
of
this
may
be
overwhelming
for
you
it
does
have
a
decent
amount
of
the
mentioned
flavors
but
for
the
dark
or
stronger
beer
drinkers
this
is
surely
a
good
beer
worth
trying
beer
is
a
little
rough
to
drink
though
harsh
sulfur
midpalate
flavor
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
but
overall
it
is
a
decent
little
beer
not
my
favorite
but
i
might
have
it
again
overall
a
tasty
and
hearty
winter
delight
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
light
tan
foamy
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
molasses
hops
and
bitter
coffee
with
some
smoky
aspects
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
caramel
and
candy
sugar
like
molasses
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
slightly
sweet
with
a
slight
burnt
aspect
overall
described
as
earthy
but
doesnt
feel
like
that
so
much
to
me
it
is
a
real
nice
drink
but
definitely
hop
forward
for
this
style
i
think
if
you
are
a
bit
of
a
hop
head
and
want
to
try
and
esb
this
might
be
your
perfect
beer
at
first
the
extremely
bitter
finish
hit
me
unexpectedly
but
my
palate
adjusted
nicely
after
a
few
more
sips
its
not
quite
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
an
interesting
one
definitely
imperial
like
the
label
says
d
admittedly
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
the
esb
style
so
this
imperial
version
hits
alot
of
the
right
notes
for
me
balanced
unique
a
brew
worth
having
o
this
beer
has
flavors
that
call
to
mind
the
season
yet
would
be
enjoyable
all
year
round
this
will
probably
be
near
the
top
of
my
list
for
this
season
guess
its
kind
of
a
shame
that
we
dont
really
have
seasons
in
florida
to
truly
appreciate
it
odpretty
good
i
enjoyed
it
definitely
one
of
the
more
solid
winter
6
packs
i
will
enjoy
all
six
of
these
i
believe
nothing
amazing
but
solid
overall
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
great
flavor
present
its
a
bit
spiceheavy
but
i
think
it
ends
up
balancing
pretty
well
a
very
good
beer
for
a
chilly
evening
91
overall
a
good
beer
from
heavy
seas
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
some
of
their
others
but
its
a
good
strong
beer
that
is
just
right
on
the
abv
o
good
stuff
and
the
first
time
i
have
really
had
this
brewery
will
try
more
o
nice
beer
a
little
off
on
some
characteristics
but
overall
i
would
get
this
again
not
something
i
would
search
for
but
if
there
was
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
heavy
but
understandably
so
a
very
enjoyable
offering
and
perfect
for
cold
weather
i
dig
it
overall
not
a
bad
esb
but
definitely
not
the
best
i
bet
most
would
like
it
but
i
like
a
little
more
of
an
english
style
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
very
little
carbonation
and
slight
bitter
finish
good
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
winter
beer
that
went
down
smooth
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
and
a
solid
esb
prost
a
welldone
wintertime
imperial
esb
this
brew
has
pretty
decent
drinkability
its
a
nice
well
rounded
brew
its
a
nice
hardy
winter
brew
i
would
surely
reach
for
this
brew
again
drinking
this
beer
reminded
me
of
smoking
a
clove
cigarette
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
solid
like
other
heavy
seas
beers
but
a
bit
too
chewy
i
like
this
kind
of
chewy
feel
in
heavy
seas
weizenbock
where
it
combines
with
banana
molasses
and
light
spice
in
winter
storm
it
combines
with
an
overpowering
range
and
intensity
of
spice
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
a
pleasant
experience
d
decently
drinkable
not
going
to
seek
this
one
out
or
anything
its
a
bit
too
sweet
without
many
interesting
elements
that
said
half
a
glass
wasnt
too
hard
to
get
down
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
slight
crisp
hot
that
still
tastes
like
the
water
was
melted
from
ice
i
liked
this
beer
a
little
more
than
i
anticipated
overall
see
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
satisfyingly
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
also
quite
good
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
id
peg
this
closer
to
a
5
based
on
taste
i
was
all
prepared
to
write
a
terrible
review
of
this
this
was
the
last
of
a
six
pack
i
bought
a
few
months
ago
which
quickly
became
my
drink
when
already
wasted
beer
because
i
really
didnt
enjoy
it
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
toostrong
hops
fighting
with
dark
fruits
and
assertive
bready
malts
pulling
in
every
direction
but
never
quite
reaching
anywhere
approaching
good
now
with
three
months
of
age
on
it
the
flavors
have
considerably
mellowed
out
and
melded
together
to
something
thats
actually
quite
nice
give
it
a
shot
especially
if
you
see
any
lingering
bottles
on
the
shelf
now
d
ive
grown
fond
of
this
style
in
the
last
couple
of
years
and
this
is
a
fine
example
of
that
jeez
an
esb
with
a
7
5abv
wow
drink
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
flavours
going
on
with
this
beer
and
that
definitely
makes
it
interesting
to
drink
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
fairly
enjoyable
it
was
the
first
heavy
seas
beer
ive
tried
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
others
from
their
lineup
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
poured
a
transparent
honey
brownamber
pour
with
creamy
bubbly
offwhite
head
with
sticky
lacing
and
soft
carbonation
very
sweet
and
fresh
earthy
hop
aroma
flavor
is
of
a
slow
starting
but
ultimately
potent
grapefruit
and
pine
hop
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
bitter
drag
soft
with
the
decent
amount
of
carbonation
ah
and
the
alcohol
will
slowly
but
surely
warm
you
up
drinkability
this
brew
is
really
pretty
good
i
think
very
solid
and
well
rounded
obviously
this
is
a
winter
beer
but
i
think
i
could
enjoy
this
on
occasion
throughout
the
year
drinkability
i
rather
liked
this
beer
and
wished
id
had
the
time
for
a
second
the
balance
of
flavors
is
very
good
but
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
basically
a
mixture
of
an
english
and
an
american
style
esb
since
it
includes
the
american
hops
not
quite
what
id
expected
in
an
esb
but
i
enjoyed
it
none
the
less
d
goes
down
nicely
but
the
alcohol
slows
you
down
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
it
was
a
nicely
flavored
winter
seasonal
it
was
malty
hoppy
and
spicy
and
worked
all
of
those
flavors
together
nicely
nice
beer
for
the
style
and
season
i
really
like
this
one
it
is
much
more
balanced
than
a
lot
of
esbs
ive
had
before
and
i
think
it
is
nice
for
a
change
there
is
hop
spice
but
not
the
elaborate
coriander
ginger
nutmeg
etc
that
you
find
with
other
winter
brews
i
prefer
when
a
brewery
can
let
the
hops
speak
in
the
beer
without
tweaking
the
natural
aromas
and
flavors
id
buy
this
again
definitely
a
beer
to
keep
you
warm
when
it
is
below
freezing
outside
now
if
only
breweries
in
the
usa
would
brew
a
real
esb
d
this
was
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
it
seemed
a
little
watery
for
the
style
or
i
should
say
because
they
made
it
seem
big
that
i
figured
it
would
have
a
big
body
the
abv
makes
no
real
fuss
in
the
beer
at
all
which
once
again
i
expected
overall
a
nice
wintertime
beer
that
is
a
little
out
of
the
norm
had
this
last
year
and
couldnt
wait
for
them
to
put
it
out
again
this
should
be
available
all
year
round
its
just
what
i
imagined
an
imperial
bitter
would
taste
like
domestic
bitters
tend
to
be
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
liking
this
one
is
slightly
sweet
somewhat
similar
to
a
fullers
heavy
seas
has
made
another
excellent
beer
baltimore
should
be
proud
d
i
am
actually
thinking
about
getting
a
six
pack
as
i
type
if
its
still
around
my
local
place
i
should
get
it
for
around
10
bucks
not
a
bad
price
for
such
a
great
brew
d
pretty
good
was
it
necessary
to
have
such
a
high
abv
im
not
sure
but
despite
the
faults
it
was
enjoyable
enough
to
order
another
i
was
impressed
by
the
two
rocky
fingers
of
lighttan
head
that
i
got
off
of
my
pour
not
only
was
it
markedly
different
than
the
fizzy
head
that
i
usually
see
from
american
adjunct
lagers
but
its
retention
was
fabulous
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
initially
big
with
malt
but
there
was
also
a
good
bit
of
piney
hops
in
the
mix
yum
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
wild
juxtaposition
of
caramel
sweetness
and
pine
hops
on
the
tongue
dang
but
this
was
really
good
and
wayyyy
too
smooth
i
could
see
putting
a
couple
of
these
away
before
i
even
knew
what
had
happened
finish
was
more
hoppy
than
malty
but
it
was
the
interplay
between
the
two
that
really
made
this
a
unique
beer
i
really
should
not
poohpooh
bottled
beers
the
way
that
i
had
been
i
would
drink
this
pretty
routinely
during
the
winter
im
normally
wary
of
anything
labeled
imperial
that
doesnt
have
russian
to
the
left
and
stout
to
the
right
especially
if
it
comes
from
an
american
brewery
that
will
practically
guarantee
that
its
overly
boozy
and
hamfistedly
hopped
however
the
imperial
part
of
this
beer
was
nearly
absent
none
of
the
usual
smelly
alcohol
no
thick
and
gooey
body
no
blackhole
gravity
none
of
the
smackyourface
hops
in
fact
this
was
as
light
and
fruity
as
a
good
uk
esb
and
only
slightly
more
alcoholic
7
50
seems
generous
in
fact
as
there
was
very
little
warmth
to
this
brew
worth
a
try
especially
because
it
is
not
imperial
anything
d
nice
runofthemill
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
while
there
are
decent
but
disappear
much
too
quickly
in
lieu
of
the
bitterness
and
overall
i
would
best
describe
this
beer
as
relatively
bland
i
chased
a
celebration
ale
wthis
fine
esb
drank
this
straight
from
the
bottle
as
it
was
from
the
fridge
a
holiday
party
wa
very
interesting
mix
of
craft
beers
i
had
my
doubts
about
following
the
celebration
ale
wthis
esb
but
it
actually
was
a
nice
brew
that
was
actually
a
perfect
step
back
if
only
slightly
from
the
celebration
ale
which
is
hop
cone
right
off
the
branch
would
definitely
have
again
and
recommend
to
all
those
looking
for
a
winterholiday
beer
thats
just
that
beer
wo
the
trimmings
clove
nutmeg
and
the
like
good
drinkability
for
a
stronger
beer
wa
hop
kick
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
big
sweet
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
fruity
hops
theres
a
strong
green
bitterness
that
dominates
from
start
to
finish
with
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
trying
to
make
itself
known
but
not
succeeding
too
well
the
finish
is
lingering
with
a
slightly
harsh
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
body
is
medium
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
nice
to
try
a
winter
beer
that
doesnt
involve
cloves
or
nutmeg
but
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
green
for
my
liking
d
this
is
like
every
other
esb
only
bolder
this
is
definitely
an
original
i
havent
really
seen
any
breweries
attempt
an
imperial
esb
so
credit
to
heavy
seas
good
beer
give
this
one
a
shot
in
the
winter
time
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
pours
a
clear
deep
orange
copper
color
with
a
thick
off
white
slightly
yellow
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
a
little
floral
and
bitter
hops
tastes
much
the
same
tons
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
slight
sweetness
from
the
malts
a
little
alcohol
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
somewhat
easy
to
drink
great
beer
overall
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
during
the
holiday
season
out
of
the
bottle
would
be
nice
for
christmas
eve
night
and
christmas
eve
dinner
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
fans
of
heavy
seas
while
not
spectacular
it
does
provide
a
some
subtle
complexity
that
is
hard
to
find
i
got
some
carmel
from
the
malt
and
bitter
with
a
little
floral
from
the
hops
it
has
a
very
nice
and
delicate
mouth
feel
the
carbonation
was
nice
in
this
beer
it
stood
up
to
is
type
extra
special
bitter
not
bad
at
all
easy
enough
to
drink
id
say
a
good
solid
brew
d
despite
its
abrasivish
flavor
and
highish
abv
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
a
good
beer
for
the
winter
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
offering
from
clipper
city
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
floral
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
present
just
a
tad
bit
sweet
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
dm
nice
crisp
carbonation
that
helps
bring
out
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
the
hops
not
really
too
overpowering
but
really
does
not
feel
much
like
a
winter
beer
great
hoppy
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
winter
beer
drinkability
not
bad
not
great
interesting
imperial
esb
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
light
toffee
taste
is
buttertoffee
and
caramel
malts
there
is
a
bitterness
at
the
end
the
alcohol
is
covered
up
by
the
bitterness
a
pretty
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
d
very
well
balanced
type
of
beer
would
definitely
enjoy
it
again
a
nice
seasonal
brew
too
bitter
at
the
back
of
my
palate
not
an
ale
for
my
taste
all
other
aspects
were
very
good
the
aroma
of
the
freshly
opened
bottle
was
very
hearty
and
pleasant
at
first
the
taste
was
nutty
like
most
ales
but
the
overwhelming
bitterness
was
too
much
might
be
an
ale
to
be
paired
with
food
probably
not
buy
this
product
again
ps
friscos
is
my
new
favortite
place
to
go
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
dose
of
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
hoppy
with
some
floral
and
earthy
notes
nice
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
a
mild
hoppiness
feel
is
light
and
a
tad
bit
harsh
drinks
fairly
well
and
is
a
nice
concept
very
unique
tasting
beer
drinkability
its
a
good
casual
drinking
beer
i
enjoyed
the
overall
experience
this
beer
company
makes
very
nice
beersnever
had
one
i
didnt
like
im
not
even
going
to
finish
reviewing
this
beer
and
save
myself
some
headache
trying
to
pick
it
apart
very
disappointed
i
love
just
about
everything
these
guys
do
but
i
gotta
say
this
fell
hard
on
its
face
not
sure
why
the
last
beer
i
just
got
done
reviewing
was
of
similar
structure
so
its
not
like
my
buds
were
like
a
deer
in
headlights
from
an
enormous
blast
of
hops
but
perhaps
ill
still
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
come
back
to
this
beer
again
some
time
my
overall
impression
was
that
this
was
a
bit
heavyhanded
heavyhanded
you
say
but
isnt
that
the
point
of
an
imperial
esb
well
i
suppose
so
no
question
that
they
pumped
this
beer
up
on
some
sort
of
beer
steriod
but
in
that
regard
it
came
across
like
a
similarly
pumpedup
body
builder
no
balance
appropriately
big
malt
but
in
an
effort
to
keep
pace
with
hopping
the
bittering
came
across
as
rough
and
a
bit
raw
the
etoh
similarly
was
not
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
and
rode
atop
with
a
warming
harshness
given
to
me
by
a
generous
onbaer
thanks
kelli
winter
storm
pours
a
beautiful
brown
with
ruby
undertones
there
is
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
moderate
lacing
on
this
i
found
the
scent
somewhat
nondescript
with
pine
and
sweet
resin
dominating
the
taate
is
where
this
one
truly
shines
for
me
an
introduction
of
sweet
sugary
maple
gives
way
to
tart
grapefruit
and
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
nearperfect
but
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
the
subtler
notes
i
am
very
sad
clipper
city
is
not
local
as
this
would
be
a
very
welcome
six
pack
to
be
always
on
hand
to
be
fair
i
must
be
very
partial
to
the
imperial
esb
style
as
i
loved
velvet
underground
esb
when
hopworks
had
it
on
draft
i
wish
more
brewers
would
work
with
this
beautiful
style
reviewers
edit
i
just
noticed
that
the
purchase
by
date
was
4
months
old
at
the
time
of
reviewing
this
may
have
affected
important
characteristics
and
will
try
to
amend
this
review
with
a
fresher
batch
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
for
a
strong
bitter
so
this
is
what
an
imperial
esb
tastes
likeamerican
brewing
at
its
best
here
even
with
excessively
creative
madeup
styles
impressive
yet
another
seasonal
we
wish
was
yearround
give
this
one
a
go
especially
if
you
are
already
sick
of
the
spiced
winter
warmers
that
taste
like
organic
toothpaste
brownish
red
light
off
cream
colored
head
slightly
opaque
mild
aroma
mostly
flowery
and
earthy
hops
big
beer
taste
sharp
chocolatey
malts
rounded
out
with
indescernable
hop
bitterness
the
hop
bite
lasts
long
moderate
mouthfeel
pretty
well
done
this
would
be
nice
in
the
winter
drinkability
this
is
like
every
other
heavy
seas
beer
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
drink
more
then
one
pours
an
ambercopperish
color
semitransparent
with
less
than
a
fingers
width
of
light
tan
head
very
light
on
the
carbonation
it
has
an
array
bitter
citrus
hoppy
and
malty
flavors
the
hops
most
present
in
the
smell
tons
of
yeast
floating
about
the
beer
makes
it
very
interesting
to
look
at
while
drinking
drinkability
definitely
an
above
average
esb
love
the
smooth
alcohol
finish
easy
to
have
two
or
three
at
a
time
warms
you
when
it
is
cold
outside
drinkability
an
above
average
bready
esb
i
could
have
two
or
three
nothing
extraordinary
but
nothing
bad
either
d
nice
drinking
winter
ale
at
7
5
abv
these
will
definitely
keep
you
warm
on
those
cold
new
england
nights
overall
i
cant
compare
this
to
others
of
the
style
as
it
isnt
a
style
ive
tried
it
is
however
a
very
nice
beer
and
another
good
member
of
the
heavy
seas
sampler
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
have
had
very
few
esbs
to
compare
it
to
d
decently
blended
and
tasty
it
didnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
though
ive
been
impressed
with
all
the
clipper
city
beers
ive
tried
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
bought
one
single
bottle
but
i
could
have
drank
2
or
3
of
this
fine
imperial
esb
d
3
i
could
not
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
the
hops
are
harsh
with
a
long
draw
at
the
end
of
bitterness
it
was
a
good
style
of
esb
and
im
impressed
with
clipper
city
this
was
the
first
imperial
esb
i
have
had
and
i
now
have
an
idea
a
bench
mark
of
what
an
imperial
esb
should
taste
like
giving
this
a
shot
on
the
tongue
sharp
carbonation
at
the
start
is
a
plus
taste
starts
with
a
honey
and
caramel
maltiness
thin
on
the
tongue
a
citric
acidity
shows
up
at
some
point
then
goes
back
into
hiding
a
nice
slight
touch
of
dark
fruit
appears
towards
the
balance
ends
with
a
potent
but
long
toasted
caramel
note
on
the
tongue
this
is
the
dominant
taste
here
overall
hints
of
bitterness
pool
in
the
corners
of
my
mouth
a
bit
of
alcohol
present
at
the
top
of
the
throat
this
beer
is
too
nondescript
to
really
impress
a
solid
brew
but
lacking
bright
or
deep
notes
one
saving
grace
is
the
strong
carbonation
the
activity
on
the
tongue
enhances
the
beers
bitter
character
and
impedes
the
toasted
malts
from
becoming
cloying
in
light
of
this
beers
shortcomings
at
7
5
abv
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
choose
to
drink
often
d
a
really
impressive
esb
enjoyable
sip
after
sip
hides
the
7
5
abv
rather
well
i
would
gladly
welcome
again
and
again
doverall
in
a
longer
3
beer
session
i
could
fit
this
in
towards
the
end
but
id
skip
it
if
i
had
lots
of
options
not
bad
but
not
super
memorable
good
drinkability
and
a
nice
change
for
a
winter
warmer
d
its
okay
but
very
thin
and
unimpressive
its
not
as
bold
as
the
bottle
lead
me
to
believe
overall
i
guess
this
one
drinks
pretty
easy
but
it
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
another
and
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
another
one
soon
considering
the
plethora
of
options
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
wish
clipper
city
the
best
in
its
endeavors
winter
storm
has
a
beautiful
reddish
color
a
sweet
vanillalike
flavor
and
leaves
very
little
behind
not
bad
but
not
worthwhile
number
five
holds
a
burnt
copperish
brown
color
thats
resembles
a
very
dark
lager
just
a
bit
of
foam
on
the
top
of
this
off
a
tap
lace
does
not
cling
well
leaving
a
loose
spider
web
design
smells
like
a
bigger
version
of
a
simple
style
its
mainly
sweet
malty
with
caramel
and
some
mild
spicing
the
hops
give
off
a
scent
thats
faint
but
not
dead
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
minimal
holiday
spices
with
just
a
sense
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
i
really
cant
say
that
though
cause
the
hops
really
dont
come
in
at
all
the
feel
is
smooth
going
down
with
no
sight
of
the
alcohol
and
the
carb
seems
muted
it
works
well
this
is
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
lightly
spiced
simple
beer
with
a
great
feel
sometimes
less
is
more
overall
a
drinkable
beer
winter
beer
that
has
a
solid
flavor
i
wish
it
wouldve
given
me
a
bit
more
head
though
a
robust
drinker
for
these
cold
winter
months
d
pretty
good
i
might
get
a
little
bit
bored
with
it
after
a
few
or
maybe
just
full
easy
drinking
brew
this
pours
a
dark
but
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
solidly
bitter
swampy
malt
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
jumps
out
with
lots
of
malty
pumkin
spice
a
little
bayberry
fruitiness
it
mellows
nicely
and
provides
a
smooth
midbodied
feel
with
a
very
tiny
bubbled
but
lively
carbonation
it
grows
on
you
full
of
dark
coffeekahlua
and
holiday
accents
that
blend
into
a
satisfying
libation
to
usher
in
the
holidays
with
aplumb
drinkable
enough
too
i
would
buy
this
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
almost
anyone
very
accessible
drinkability
its
alright
i
suppose
its
sweet
its
got
ample
bitterness
and
alcohol
though
thankfully
not
anymore
than
it
does
personally
ive
never
been
overly
enamored
with
the
heavy
seas
lineup
but
you
could
certainly
do
alot
worse
than
this
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
warm
translucent
coppery
amber
with
a
fine
copperytan
head
aroma
is
strong
spicy
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
flavor
is
rich
malty
and
spicy
with
an
undertone
of
hops
that
is
only
slightly
bitter
texture
is
sharp
lively
sassy
and
tingly
and
leaves
a
hoppybitter
and
spicy
finish
i
wouldnt
buy
a
6pack
but
its
nice
to
have
a
chance
encounter
poured
to
a
brownish
orange
with
medium
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
nose
was
very
hard
to
detect
and
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
on
the
thin
side
taste
tried
to
bring
out
some
caramel
hints
as
well
as
a
touch
of
hoppy
fruit
but
didnt
exceed
well
at
7
3
abv
i
would
have
expected
either
a
whiff
or
taste
of
alcohol
but
got
neither
not
surprisingly
finish
was
somewhat
on
the
short
and
watery
side
have
realoly
enjoyed
the
others
ive
had
from
clipper
city
this
one
just
missed
the
mark
slightly
drinkability
actually
pretty
good
drinkability
smooth
and
at
7
5
abv
is
certainly
impressive
if
you
like
southern
tier
old
man
winter
then
i
highly
reccomend
this
beer
very
similar
in
style
and
taste
drinkability
im
glad
i
bought
this
beer
its
a
tasty
well
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
sneaky
7

abv
good
stuff
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
enjoyed
this

drinkability
is
good
could
have
a
couple
more
tonight

alcohol
very
nicely
masked
here
notes
imperial
esb
or
not
this
is
a
rather
nice
malty
brew
with
a
nice
hop
counterbalance
the
cask
profile
gives
it
quite
a
nice
character
d
i
actually
like
this
beer
a
lot
nice
americanization
of
a
classic
british
style
d
easy
to
drink
with
mellow
flavors
this
beer
goes
down
easy
even
though
it
may
be
lacking
in
some
other
catagories
pours
a
blood
orange
color
hazy
with
a
rather
small
tight
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
bready
some
pepper
and
a
muted
citrus
hop
fairly
large
honey
malt
presence
in
the
taste
bready
very
light
pepper
and
a
grassy
slightly
piney
hop
has
a
bit
of
a
funk
taste
from
the
yeast
funk
as
in
off
not
farmhouse
kind
of
like
a
buttery
apricot
flavor
moderate
feel
bordering
on
full
soft
carbonation
sweet
overall
but
finishes
with
a
slight
bitter
twang
a
so
so
brew
decent
flavors
but
some
odd
flavors
as
well
they
seem
to
go
with
a
imperial
esb
which
seems
counter
to
the
style
why
take
a
lighter
style
brew
and
imperialize
it
i
dont
get
this
imperial
pils
esb
helles
why
imperial
bud
light
here
we
come
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
while
much
hoppier
than
classic
esbs
i
think
the
hops
worked
in
this
beers
favor
and
the
malt
profile
itself
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
well
worth
a
shot
pours
a
clear
ruby
red
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
head
dissipates
fast
but
gives
off
a
light
hoppy
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
the
flavor
begins
with
sweet
semitart
maltyness
and
transitions
smoothly
into
a
tart
hoppy
flavor
well
balanced
this
brew
has
a
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
finish
fades
into
a
slight
alcohol
taste
as
the
flavor
fades
away
a
tart
after
taste
remains
mfd
good
carbonation
a
little
rough
and
unrefined
going
down
bitter
hop
finish
d
very
high
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
i
could
go
for
another
served
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
dark
copper
color
almost
brown
there
was
about
a
finger
of
tan
bubbles
when
first
poured
that
quickly
dissipated
there
is
a
strong
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
it
evokes
grass
and
caramel
its
quite
pleasant
when
you
first
taste
the
beer
youre
greeted
by
a
smooth
maltiness
this
quickly
gives
way
to
bitter
hops
the
bitterness
lingers
on
after
you
swallow
and
evolves
to
a
slightly
burnt
flavor
its
complex
and
interesting
the
beer
has
a
fuller
body
than
i
expected
it
really
coats
your
mouth
theres
also
more
carbonation
than
i
thought
there
would
be
i
find
the
winter
storm
to
be
very
drinkable
it
isnt
a
beer
id
want
to
drink
quickly
but
it
has
some
great
characteristics
that
make
me
think
i
could
slowly
enjoy
a
number
of
bottles
over
the
course
of
an
evening
drinkability
greatly
refreshing
but
also
a
good
brew
for
cold
weather
thanks
to
some
nice
malt
flavors
drinkability
a
very
good
esb
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
night
very
drinkable
besides
the
7
5
abv
but
the
hints
of
spiciness
paired
with
the
good
balance
of
hoppiness
and
malt
is
a
key
factor
in
this
beers
complexity
definetley
a
beer
ill
be
having
more
of
this
winter
tastes
fine
mouthfeel
is
all
good
drinkable
give
it
a
try
d
if
you
like
bitter
ales
then
you
will
find
this
very
drinkable
for
this
style
cask
at
churchkey
cloudy
amber
with
chunks
and
floaties
medium
light
tan
bubbles
just
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
of
bread
and
caramel
nicely
hopped
but
with
a
good
malt
balance
taste
has
a
few
splinters
of
oak
very
subtle
longish
bitter
finish
nice
enough
pours
an
attractive
orangeamber
color
transparent
with
some
visible
carbonation
and
a
medium
sized
sticky
peach
colored
head
perfumey
nose
mint
leaves
planty
hops
and
an
alcoholsolvent
character
a
round
sweetness
balances
the
very
hoppy
profile
peppery
assertive
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
content
is
apparent
only
in
the
nose
and
it
does
become
off
putting
after
a
while
not
the
best
ive
had
in
this
imperial
esb
style
but
then
again
not
the
worst
a
strawberry
jam
colored
beer
with
a
cappuccino
colored
head
smell
is
hoppy
a
big
old
hop
smell
kicking
the
nostrils
taste
starts
out
a
deeply
bitter
taste
which
sweetens
as
it
finishes
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
the
beer
gets
to
be
much
sweeter
as
you
move
through
the
glass
this
is
a
medium
bodied
bubbly
beer
the
beer
is
sweet
enough
to
settle
my
desires
for
a
bitter
brew
while
sweet
enough
to
keep
me
interested
poured
a
perfectly
clear
deep
amber
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
to
a
very
thin
collar
i
couldnt
get
much
of
anything
for
aroma
the
taste
was
lightly
malt
and
even
more
lightly
hops
in
other
words
a
little
bit
sweet
and
a
little
less
bitter
not
a
real
stand
out
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
not
bad
i
have
found
the
clipper
city
beers
to
generally
be
good
valued
beers
this
one
grows
on
you
or
me
at
least
nicely
balanced
medium
body
with
some
caramel
malt
and
hazelnut
countering
a
bitter
earthy
hop
presence
the
hop
bitterness
is
pretty
tame
and
not
too
overpowering
but
lasts
throughout
the
abv
is
pretty
well
masked
with
only
some
slight
alcohol
warmth
d
for
this
style
id
drink
this
all
the
time
drinkability
not
quite
as
sessionable
as
id
like
i
could
enjoy
more
but
would
prefer
a
less
hoppy
esb
for
a
session
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
one
very
drinkable
alcohol
was
warming
but
not
overbearing
on
the
taste
a
nice
drinking
beer
overall
drink
ability
is
good
for
7
5
percent
the
alcohol
was
hidden
nicely
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
overall
a
good
beer
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
a
very
sessionable
beer
medium
body
medium
to
almost
light
carbonation
nice
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
nice
good
drinkable
beer
i
recommend
this

all

nicely
with

had
d
pretty
solid

ever

pretty
good

of

this
brew

abv
i
guess
you
could
call
this
am
imperial
esb
sadly
there
were
only
three
to
enjoy
pours
a
slightly
hazy
rich
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
strongly
of
hops
then
some
sweet
malt
come
through
theres
some
nutty
and
biscuit
aromas
as
well
fits
the
style
of
a
extra
special
strong
bitter
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
a
noticeable
dryness
is
present
as
well
tastes
of
hops
up
front
then
sweet
malt
then
the
nut
flavors
and
dryness
are
present
an
interesting
yeast
flavor
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
come
through
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
again
hops
overall
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
esb
but
surprisingly
good
dark
reddish
orange
with
a
big
fat
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
rings
of
sticky
lace
all
down
the
glass
smells
nice
and
hoppy
with
some
caramel
malt
tastes
more
like
a
dipa
than
iesb
to
me
but
who
cares
tasty
and
richly
malty
with
gobs
of
grapefruity
hops
slathered
on
top
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
hop
heads
delight
for
sure
poured
amber
with
gold
shimmers
not
much
of
a
head
and
there
was
some
spotty
lacings
left
on
the
glass
oaky
smell
mixed
with
honey
somewhat
sweet
citrus
and
honey
mixed
with
malt
taste
nice
hop
bitterness
seems
a
little
bitey
for
an
esb
but
still
very
tasty
slick
oily
mouthfeel
slides
down
nice
and
easy
overall
nice
beer
worth
a
try
different
from
other
esbs
that
i
have
tried
while
id
like
the
nose
to
exhibit
a
bit
more
specific
hop
character
i
want
the
bitterness
to
not
be
as
harsh
in
the
finish
impossibly
to
please
i
suppose
even
with
those
complaints
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
id
happily
down
a
few
d
tasty
beer
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
its
even
better
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
slightly
stronger
beer
in
this
style
pours
a
clear
amber
red
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
small
thin
ring
with
some
legs
and
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
some
dark
fruits
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
fruity
with
some
yeast
and
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
bitter
hoppiness
at
the
end
but
mostly
an
alcohol
sting
another
reviewer
stated
this
is
more
like
a
light
barleywine
since
this
is
billed
as
a
imperial
esb
i
would
agree
but
it
needs
more
hops
to
become
a
true
bwine
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
from
the
alcohol
and
could
be
a
little
thicker
in
the
body
drinkability
is
good
for
a
cold
snowy
night
i
could
finish
off
a
sixer
by
the
fire
before
bed
d
feels
like
the
key
to
this
beer
is
to
serve
it
just
lightly
chilled
so
much
larger
flavor
profile
than
when
its
cold
its
says
esb
but
tastes
more
like
a
light
barleywine
either
way
i
like
it
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
the
nose
but
the
bitter
hops
are
more
prevalent
and
floral
has
a
british
feel
to
it
but
without
the
mineral
flavors
there
is
a
heavy
malt
backbone
here
and
has
a
big
beer
feel
to
it
not
bad
but
not
particularly
memorable
either
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
winter
seasonal
d
i
am
a
fan
of
big
bitterness
but
with
the
alcohol
being
quite
inyourface
i
feel
it
is
best
sipped
instead
of
guzzled
but
thats
just
me
blipped
children
of
the
sea
by
black
sabbath
the
finish
is
nothing
but
the
warming
alcohol
it
gets
my
attention
like
i
just
took
a
shot
of
something
harsh
not
the
strongest
in
terms
of
alcohol
ive
ever
had
but
it
tasted
like
it
halfway
through
carbonation
seems
to
fade
and
the
drinkability
subsides
a
bit
for
my
liking
d
pretty
good
tastes
like
it
says
it
is
a
strong
esb
notes
from
122407
ive
had
these
before
and
ill
have
them
again
within
minutes
like
all
the
other
heavy
seas
beers
this
is
recommended
drinkability
fair
i
guess
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
my
idea
of
a
good
winter
brew
probably
wont
have
another
but
worth
the
try
and
experience
of
having
this
type
of
beer
easy
drinking
smooth
and
an
enjoyable
winter
esb
i
do
look
forward
to
this
seasonal
from
clipper
city
it
is
balanced
and
one
of
the
more
approachable
brews
in
their
heavy
seas
series
a
solid
brew
poured
a
twofinger
head
with
seethru
body
that
left
a
lace
ring
as
it
went
down
my
mug
small
minor
aromas
of
both
sweet
malts
and
citric
hop
notes
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
subdued
malt
sensation
that
is
wellbalanced
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
caramel
the
hops
are
noticeable
too
with
a
leafy
bitter
feeling
that
leads
to
a
balanced
beer
and
a
spicy
dry
backbite
both
mellowsweet
and
with
some
hop
pickmeup
the
abv
is
tucked
away
well
and
this
beer
picked
me
up
on
a
very
cold
pittsburgh
afternoon
superclear
almost
shiny
amber
red
to
orange
in
hue
you
could
read
an
eye
chart
through
it
the
head
disappears
real
real
quick
with
no
real
lacing
left
behind
nothing
archly
bitter
about
the
nose
green
hops
spices
meadowlike
florality
and
grassiness
nothing
too
concentrated
the
citrus
component
starts
and
then
stops
not
too
round
nor
soft
just
angular
enough
to

would
make
an
excellent

beer
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
not
bad
at
all
but
not
the
best
from
clipper
city
certainly
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
beer
store
that
allows
single
bottle
purchases
i
love
clipper
city
beer
they
always
have
something
wonderful
to
offer
would
that
they
could
increase
their
distribution
area
so
more
beer
lovers
could
fall
in
love
with
their
wonderful
product
drinkability
a
fine
winter
beer
i
can
see
why
people
are
giving
this
one
accolades

a
pretty

esb
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
id
recommend
it
for
sure
m
mediumtothin
and
gone
after
the
swallow
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
for
an
imperial
esb
its
not
quite
sessionable
but
i
could
have
two
without
burning
out
tonight
i
had
a
stronger
beer
earlier
and
im
ready
to
call
it
a
night
d
love
esbs
in
general
but
clipper
city
takes
this
well
beyond
most
could
see
myself
buying
some
to
savor
year
round
d
i
like
this
one
here
and
a
solid
brew
for
sure
clipper
city
has
brewed
up
a
powerful
storm
of
flavor
with
this
one
this
is
an
amped
up
esb
that
still
stays
fairly
drinkable
its
not
extremely
complex
but
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
this
is
a
very
good
winter
ale
that
fits
as
a
very
malty
but
hoppy
ale
its
a
very
good
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
a
balanced
beer
brewed
with
care
and
no
malt
or
hops
limits
medium
bodied
creamy
doughy
the
carbonation
keeps
things
fairly
easy
drinking
d
this
is
an
extreme
esb
and
i
like
it
alot
creamy
and
rather
thick
feel
a
tiny
burn
at
the
swallow
a
good
slightly
unbalanced
drink
very
drinkable
but
sweeter
than
it
could
be
drinkability
a
pleasant
enough
beer
with
nice
malt
depth
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
finishes
really
dry
which
accentuates
the
hop
bitterness
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
heavy
in
the
alcohol
for
an
esb
but
i
guess
this
is
a
heavy
seas
beer
i
would
recommend
this
one
a
decent
stab
at
an
esb
im
not
sure
that
it
is
really
so
strong
that
it
deserves
the
imperial
designation
on
the
bottle
but
i
will
look
for
it
again
next
year
on
the
dry
side
surprising
considering
the
smell
full
bodied
but
not
quite
creamy
peppery
hop
swallow
and
aftertaste
theres
a
dry
darker
malt
flavor
that
comes
out
in
the
aftertaste
great
complexity
and
blend
of
flavors
d
not
something
i
would
session
again
i
think
more
hops
or
reigning
back
the
malt
some
would
help
hide
or
mask
the
alcohol
and
improve
the
drinkability
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
nice
clear
amber
color
mix
of
hops
and
malt
nose
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
almost
sweet
caramel
with
the
hops
balancing
better
than
an
esb
brewer
calls
this
an
imperial
esb
which
fits
2
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
best
before
mar
2009
the
taste
is
a
delight
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
not
too
syrupy
on
the
tongue
but
oily
and
smooth
this
is
a
complex
beer
for
sure
there
is
the
full
palate
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
there
is
a
liqueur
type
sweetness
with
warming
alcohol
notes
there
is
also
some
citrus
flavors
most
noteably
a
bit
of
cherry
and
orange
rind
there
is
a
nice
piney
grapefruity
slightly
bittering
hop
presence
there
isnt
the
oily
or
estery
hoppiness
in
the
beer
nor
is
it
overly
leafy
or
bittering
the
hop
is
just
so
well
balanced
with
the
sweet
malts
and
liqueur
and
warming
alcohol
notes
that
the
whole
beer
comes
together
just
nicely
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
over
the
top
there
is
a
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
and
some
lingering
piney
hop
bite
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
real
treat
lchaim
an
unexpected
find
from
clipper
city
this
is
surely
the
best
imperial
esb
ive
had
not
that
ive
had
many
but
its
all
around
above
average
beer
lacks
brew
magic
yet
solid
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
and
i
find
this
very
drinkable
almost
sessionable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
until
you
finish
the
six
pack
and
have
a
decent
buzz
going
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
sudzy
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
carmel
malts
and
faint
citrus
hops
tastes
is
full
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
up
front
but
over
the
effect
is
wellbalaced
because
it
finishes
considerably
drier
with
a
burst
of
piney
hops
on
the
back
end
that
linger
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
in
terms
of
drinkability
winter
storm
is
dangerously
good
despite
its
high
abv
i
could
keep
reaching
for
this
one
all
night
long
d
another
please
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
will
revisit
this
winter
and
in
winters
to
come
a
little
high
in
abv
but
its
difficult
to
notice
notes
so
well
balanced
alcohol
was
well
hidden
a
true
winter
beer
and
a
fine
one
at
that
next
time
i
buy
six
12109i
did
just
that
mouthfeel
is
of
lingering
hops
good
malty
creaminess
silky
and
easy
to
drinksession
despite
higher
alc
d
id
drink
another
not
my
favorite
but
id
recommend
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
unique
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
beer
perfect
for
cold
nights
either
at
sea
or
on
land
it
is
quite
bold
yet
is
still
eminently
drinkable
another
fine
effort
for
heavy
seas
nikki
d
this
is
a
nice
winter
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
other
heavy
seas
beer
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
esb
but
for
me
this
style
of
beer
i
cannot
have
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
esbs
though
that
i
have
tried
though
i
have
not
tried
many
but
i
will
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
a
nice
heavy
hitting
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewery
imo
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
it
poured
a
light
ambercopper
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
disappeared
as
i
drank
it
the
smell
was
of
sweet
hoppy
notes
maybe
a
little
caramel
as
well
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
as
it
did
not
live
up
to
the
smell
and
up
to
imperial
esb
expectations
with
that
said
the
drinkability
was
also
average
as
it
left
a
little
dryness
at
the
finish
this
would
be
beer
2
from
my
thanksgiving
brew
pack
the
label
calls
this
beer
an
imperial
esb
or
extra
special
bitter
ive
had
esbs
before
in
the
past
but
never
an
imperial
esb
so
my
interests
are
already
peaked
i
poured
the
beer
into
my
crystal
snifter
with
very
little
head
the
color
is
a
deep
ruby
yielding
to
light
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
rich
with
the
fresh
citrus
and
bitterness
of
hops
along
with
the
roasted
mellow
notes
of
malt
the
taste
is
equally
impressive
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
provided
by
the
hops
and
keeps
the
aftertaste
nice
and
clean
the
malts
provide
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
that
round
out
the
beer
the
label
proclaims
a
7
5
abv
which
is
well
hidden
i
would
highly
recommend
checking
this
wonderful
winter
brew
ive
had
this
beer
on
multiple
occasions
from
its
arrival
until
now
and
it
was
enjoyable
each
time
and
its
worth
purchasing
id
call
it
a
good
value
poured
a
redish
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
white
lacing
over
the
entire
top
the
smell
is
big
red
malt
and
not
to
be
out
done
some
hops
hit
my
nose
the
taste
at
first
is
carmel
malt
dry
bread
and
the
start
of
the
hops
the
midle
is
the
malt
and
hops
ballincang
equaly
with
each
outher
and
the
end
flavor
is
a
strong
pine
tar
tipe
taste
i
dont
know
much
about
the
stile
but
i
like
this
one
for
sure
d
pretty
solid
drinker
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
it
drinks
pretty
well
overall
winter
storm
is
a
pretty
solid
winter
seasonal
that
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
taste
of
alcohol
and
some
citrus
notes
deep
bitter
aftertaste
some
licorice
and
dark
fruit
flavors
gets
better
as
it
warms
not
too
bad
moutfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
due
to
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
esb
but
wouldnt
drink
a
ton
of
these
due
to
the
abv
d
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
the
hoppiness
and
abv
make
it
a
little
less
drinkable
than
your
typical
esb
but
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
another
solid
beer
from
the
heavy
seas
line
yargh
this
here
beauty
is
chock
full
of
goodness
friendly
aroma
not
overpowering
which
looses
a
point
or
so
with
me
somewhat
typical
hop
nose
amazing
pour
color
is
a
very
dark
copper
almost
brown
big
fluffy
tan
head
that
has
no
intention
of
leaving
lots
of
stringy
lacing
cascading
down
as
the
beer
is
drunk
mouthfeel
is
nice
easy
quenching
and
smooth
nothing
outstanding
flavor
is
warming
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
hearty
hop
presence
more
bitter
and
citrus
than
evergreen
thick
malt
content
very
surprising
a
little
bit
of
caramel
is
detected
overall
unexpected
and
absolutely
enjoyable
yargh
average
d
i
like
this
one
its
kind
of
quirky
and
interesting
and
its
rather
drinkable
considering
the
abv
and
the
fairly
bold
hops
not
something
youd
session
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
esbs
ive
tried
it
has
lots
of
character
and
a
well
made
taste
notes
this
is
my
first
reviewed
cask
beer
and
i
loved
the
presentation
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
i
believe
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
from
a
cask
very
cool
and
i
think
that
it
really
enhanced
the
beer
d
overall
a
tad
sweet
for
mulitiples
along
with
the
high
abv
but
was
generally
a
good
experience
by
itself
and
six
pack
worthy
for
future
drinkings
the
body
is
moderate
full
but
hard
to
pick
out
from
the
sweet
finish
overall
this
is
too
much
for
an
esb
and
with
the
spice
characteristics
i
cant
see
how
this
is
an
esb
i
think
i
may
have
drank
this
beer
a
little
late
in
the
season
everything
looks
good
from
the
pour
smells
like
a
good
ale
and
it
looks
a
little
cloudy
up
front
the
beer
taste
good
with
a
notable
amount
of
good
malt
and
hop
balance
the
finish
is
a
bit
off
though
im
not
sure
if
its
the
yeast
giving
off
an
odd
tone
at
the
end
i
get
a
sweaty
sock
taste
at
the
end
almost
reminds
me
of
bad
tap
water
it
not
so
bad
that
the
beer
is
undrinkable
but
doesnt
make
me
want
to
drink
6
of
them
this
one
pours
a
deep
copper
color
under
a
beautifully
thick
and
full
head
great
lacing
strong
aroma
of
hops
and
alcohol
some
citrus
and
caramel
in
the
nose
as
well
great
taste
grassy
hops
balanced
very
well
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
some
malt
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
not
too
much
a
citrusy
and
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
nice
full
mouthfeel
would
definitely
have
another
lucky
to
find
this
on
a
local
grocers
shelf
5
99
for
the
six
out
of
date
it
isnt
warming
easily
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
d
another
tasty
big
beer
from
clipper
city
pretty
bold
with
a
complex
hop
profile
finish
is
just
a
tad
astringent
but
nothing
that
really
affects
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
brew
this
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
offwhite
head
its
smell
was
a
good
malt
and
hops
blend
and
it
had
the
solid
taste
of
a
quality
ipa
that
i
havent
had
in
a
while
its
flavor
was
dominated
by
bitter
hops
but
somewhat
balanced
by
malt
i
didnt
sense
any
winter
spices
however
it
was
thick
and
smooth
with
a
nice
aftertaste
that
was
noticeable
but
not
too
strong
overall
this
was
a
really
tasty
ipa
but
too
standard
to
call
it
a
winter
brew
d
i
wrote
3
5
i
remember
buying
this
beer
from
a
place
id
gotten
several
bad
beers
that
had
orange
stickers
on
them
this
one
had
an
orange
sticker
so
i
let
it
linger
in
the
fridge
for
several
weeks
maybe
several
months
well
i
was
out
of
beer
one
night
and
i
gently
poured
it
and
go
get
em
dudes
it
was
a
mo
fuckin
ok
pour
me
another
now
first
taste
this
is
a
very
good
esb
englishhop
bitterness
prevails
up
front
and
a
malty
syrupy
sweetness
works
its
way
around
the
outskirts
of
the
palate
a
medicinal
alcoholrich
finish
pairs
up
with
bitter
piney
hops
to
coat
the
back
of
the
throat
and
leave
a
lasting
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
viscous
with
a
low
carbonation
level
that
id
expect
with
the
high
abv
this
is
not
exactly
the
most
drinkable
beer
as
it
sits
heavy
in
the
stomach
and
gives
the
palate
a
hefty
workout
however
i
could
see
this
staving
off
the
cold
with
the
best
of
winter
warmers
and
imperial
stouts
good
complexity
great
flavor
and
one
ill
definately
be
having
again
winter
storm
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
thick
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
tastes
of
dark
crystal
and
plenty
of
citrusy
spicy
and
earthy
hops
some
light
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
end
along
with
some
dark
fruitiness
a
must
try
i
really
like
it
i
wish
i
could
get
more
in
depth
about
it
when
i
drink
this
beer
i
def
dont
feel
the
7
5
its
just
that
good
my
kind
of
ipa
the
malts
play
a
heavier
role
than
average
creating
a
nice
balance
that
enhances
drinkability
which
makes
up
for
the
average
complexity
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
since
my
fridge
is
cold
glad
i
did
got
a
full
dose
of
the
caramel
sweetness
herbal
hoppiness
and
some
faint
ripe
fruit
right
off
the
bat
strong
with
great
balance
like
a
wellforged
blade
has
substance
without
being
to
syrupy
the
alcohol
for
7
5
is
wellhidden
without
being
concealed
by
too
big
a
taste
and
just
adds
to
the
complexity
it
actually
provides
a
tad
bit
of
throat
warmth
during
the
final
sips
like
a
winter
warmeresb
hybrid
should
and
a
welldone
one
at
that
this
beer
is
not
a
superstar
it
doesnt
scream
for
attention
but
its
no
slouch
either
at
over
seven
per
cent
alcohol
it
should
be
treated
with
respect
winter
storm
does
live
up
to
the
legacy
of
its
style
though
an
easy
drinker
for
daily
use
heavy
seas
habit
of
making
imperial
classics
is
really
paying
off
for
me
and
winter
storm
works
as
smooth
drinking
delicious
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
light
mahogany
color

that
leaves

sweet

of
prunes

and

tons
of

up

sweet
immediately
then
the
hops
take
over
for
the
finish
tastes
of
dried
fruits
with
a
floral
garden
finish
warm
and
thick
mouthfeel
mild
carbonation
very
smooth
for
a
7

imperial
esb
plenty
of
carbonation
and
plenty
dry
finish
to
make
it
drinkable
would
say
sessionable
except
for
the
7
5
this
pours
an
almost
clear
reddishorange
with
a
dirty
white
frothy
head
lacing
is
very
good
the
smell
at
first
is
very
similar
to
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
with
some
piny
and
earthy
hops
coming
through
with
more
time
you
get
a
big
pale
and
caramel
malt
presence
at
the
first
sip
the
hops
hit
pretty
hard
again
earthy
and
a
bit
citrusy
fading
into
a
caramel
or
melanoidin
sweetness
at
the
end
that
starts
to
dominate
as
you
get
a
bit
numb
to
the
hops
the
general
feeling
is
that
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
esb
ive
never
had
an
imperial
esb
but
this
kicks
up
both
flavors
the
hops
and
malt
to
something
a
bit
more
intense
but
yet
still
balances
them
very
nicely
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
you
pretty
much
enjoy
a
more
malty
beer
as
the
hop
presence
has
lessened
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
slick
this
is
a
type
of
beer
i
could
find
myself
having
a
few
of
and
not
getting
tired
of
it
d
damn
fine
ale
i
could
tip
these
as
long
as
you
keep
poppin
them
in
front
of
me
given
that
i
can
still
stand
this
is
definatly
not
an
instant
classic
in
my
eyes
but
still
good
none
the
less
the
hops
flavor
is
too
overpowering
in
fact
thats
about
all
you
taste
i
anticipated
this
beer
to
be
amazing
but
after
trying
it
i
think
its
awful
i
guess
its
just
another
heavy
thick
beer
i
cant
handle
the
taste
on
first
sips
gives
me
a
very
large
caramel
malt
flavour
and
some
alcohol
a
few
more
sips
in
and
the
hops
take
their
place
with
both
grass
and
grapefruit
and
some
earthy
flavour
is
there
as
well
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
it
finishes
with
a
healthy
dose
of
grass
a
pretty
good
sipper
here
but
i
think
the
alcohol
isnt
as
well
hidden
as
in
other
brews
of
similar
abv
too
much
warming
in
the
throat
i
wasnt
expecting
an
esb
for
a
winter
seasonal
but
ill
take
it
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
foamy
longlasting
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
i
get
mostly
malt
in
the
aroma
semisweet
caramel
with
a
bit
of
piney
hops
mixed
in
but
nothing
overpowering
malt
takes
over
in
the
taste
with
some
bitter
citrus
tacked
on
to
make
this
a
true
bitter
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
a
solid
brew
to
come
in
from
the
cold
for
d
i
like
big
beer
the
heavy
seas
line
sure
has
it
down
and
i
will
try
my
damndest
to
sample
every
one
so
far

steve

very
nice

at

on

any

i
wouldnt

it

on

this
is
a
beer
i
quite
appreciate
and
enjoy
md
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
just
right
alcohol
is
apparent
but
nothing
harsh
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
really
a
well
done
beer
d
i
really
like
this
beer

a

and
whole
wheat
bread
in
there
as
well
with
a
slight
alcoholic
touch
very
pleasing
on
the
palate
this
one
is
a
hoppy
esb
with
more
fresh
hop
flavor
overplaying
the
malt
tones
while
not
as
bitter
as
an
ipa
it
isnt
classic

clipper
city
continues
to
make
some
nice
imperial
beers
would
try
again
poured
a
surprisingly
good
appearance
long
lasting
thick
offwhite
head
with
generous
amounts
of
lacing
very
strong
hop
aroma
with
a
hint
of
a
thick
malt
note
i
cant
beleive
this
brew
is
7
5
abv
ive
been
drinking
them
all
week
and
havent
even
noticed
thin
lacing
circles
the
glass
the
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
very
bitter
onesided
taste
that
leaves
a
long
dry
bitter
after
taste
overall
this
is
very
good
and
perfect
for
the
long
cold
winter
months
i
think
they
should
make
the
name
of
this
brew
more
clear
i
didnt
know
if
it
was
called
winter
storm
heavy
seas
or
category
5
ale
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
is
surely
there
after
half
the
glass
was
down
would
of
liked
to
see
a
touch
more
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
ive
become
charmed
a
bit
by
clipper
citys
heavy
seas
series
ive
yet
to
have
one
in
the
family
that
i
didnt
care
for
its
also
great
to
have
a
winter
ale
that
isnt
loaded
up
with
tons
of
spices
not
that
i
mind
spiced
winter
ales
basically
if
you
want
to
change
the
pace
a
bit
on
a
cold
winters
night
this
might
fix
what
ails
ya
pun
intended
of
course
d
a
decent
beer
if
you
like
strong
a
strong
malthop
beer
overall
its
decent
brew
and
ill
drink
it
again
esbs
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
ones
decent
nice
company
for
a
winter
night
nice
smell
but
the
hops
which
i
normally
would
welcome
as
i
did
on
the
smell
seem
out
of
whack
here
the
noticeable
alcohol
and
tannic
finish
slow
this
one
down
not
bad
but
wouldnt
be
among
my
top
choices
for
a
winter
beer
served
cask
conditioned
ive
had
this
one
bottled
before
so
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
try
in
from
the
cask
crisp
floral
hop
aroma
backed
by
a
bit
of
caramel
malts
the
mouth
feel
was
very
smooth
with
a
very
nice
piney
and
floral
hop
flavor
a
very
nice
beer
and
the
7
50
abv
is
well
masked
d
boozy
and
not
really
all
that
interesting
to
me
this
is
kind
of
rich
but
not
all
that
complex
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
very
little
head
that
quickly
dissapates
hops
dominate
the
aroma
with
floral
and
piney
notes
with
some
yeasty
notes
and
biscuity
malt
notes
taste
reflects
the
aroma
with
mostly
hop
flavor
coming
out
balanced
with
toasty
malt
moderate
carbonation
accentuates
the
hops
without
making
the
beer
too
filling
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
more
hoppy
than
many
of
the
amber
winter
beers
which
i
find
as
a
welcome
change
to
many
of
the
malt
balanced
beers
smooth
beer
not
to
hoppy
not
too
bland
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
too
much
of
a
winter
beer
by
definition
but
tasty
id
definately
pick
this
one
up
in
case
form
if
i
ever
saw
it
overall
a
very
nice
ale
and
worth
a
try
a
pleasant
and
very
flavorful
esb
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
brew
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
retains
wonderfully
great
lacing
left
behind
with
each
sip
smells
of
floral
hops
and
sweet
malts
maybe
a
little
bready
aromas
too
tastes
of
sweet
malts
and
lots
of
hoppiness
this
is
definitely
an
imperial
esb
almost
like
a
hopped
up
red
ale
but
different
malt
bill
not
too
much
depth
but
very
good
taste
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
finishing
a
bit
dry
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
session
beer
as
its
fairly
strong
7

but
i
would
enjoy
a
few
of
these
not
bad
at
all
the
firm
malty
character
of
an
esb
is
here
but
its
slapped
upside
the
head
by
the
hops
the
brewery
dubs
it
an
imperial
esb
whatever
this
is
one
beer
where
style
categorization
isnt
necessary
it
needs
to
be
enjoyed
for
what
it
is

solid

is
in

as
well
but
lose
some
of
their

character
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
flavor
that
comes
at
you
hard
and
stays
with
you
through
the
finish
the
malt
bill
warms
you
and
for
a
winter
beer
ill
have
another
one
i
suppose
this
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
medium
tanish
head
that
disapated
rather
quickly
there
was
some
good
lacing
down
the
side
the
aroma
is
of
some
floral
hops
but
not
as
intense
as
i
would
expect
for
a
double
ipa
there
was
also
the
smell
of
lemon
and
a
touch
of
malt
character
overall
pleasing
the
taste
of
hops
is
a
bit
more
intense
than
what
i
smelled
and
it
also
is
a
bit
peppery
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
that
is
enjoyable
and
never
gets
too
heavy
drinkabilty
this
does
not
overwhelm
the
tastebuds
and
several
of
these
can
be
quaffed
in
a
session
not
great
but
enjoyable
and
worth
seeking
out
this
very
drinkable
strong
ipa
strong
enough
to
numb
your
tongue
this
just
doesnt
taste
that

pulverizing
as
i
expected
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
the
bitterness
is
nicely
balanced
making
it
go
down
easy
it
did
have
the
typical
ipa
characteristic
of
leaving
my
mouth
very
dry
though
also
featured
the
typical
dark
amber
color
of
highly
hopped
beers
with
a
frothy
head
i
enjoyed
this
beer
somewhat
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
clipper
citys
heavy
seas
line
i
just
didnt
find
it
unique
enough
to
really
try
it
again
the
bloodhound
factor
benji
went
for
the
kill
on
this
one
really
dug
it
peaches
wasnt
in
the
beer
mood
more
for
the
guys
woohoo
dark
gold
tarnished
brass
with
an
offwhite
head
and
some
stickiness
plenty
of
tinybubbled
carbonation
smell
is
mild
hops
and
a
smooth
malty
odor
taste
is
a
fine
blend
of
grainy
malts
floral
hops
and
some
sweet
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
medium
body
drinkability
is
fine
for
the
style
high
abv
keeps
it
from
being
sessionable
enjoyable
this
brew
was
from
a
recent
trade
with
meathookjones
but
im
pretty
sure
i
got
another
bottle
in
a
trade
a
month
or
so
ago
i
sure
hope
i
have
another
bottle
ive
got
to
go
check
my
stock
to
see
if
ive
got
more
of
this
maybe
ill
arrange
another
trade
soon
to
get
another
couple
winter
storms
maybe
ill
just
move
to
baltimore
so
i
can
have
this
year
round
dang
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
s
this
is
an
easy
drinking
dipa
although
it
seems
more
like
just
an
ipa
orangeapricot
colored
body
with
a
one
inch
offwhite
head
aroma
is
very
light
a
touch
of
citrus
and
some
grassy
hop
aromas
not
much
else
taste
is
mainly
hop
dominated
but
not
overly
bitter
hops
are
floral
and
citrus
in
nature
there
is
a
bit
of
an
herbal
side
to
the
hops
in
this
brew
needs
more
malts
to
fill
this
out
a
bit
unbalanced
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
not
overly
thick
and
oily
like
i
feel
it
should
be
drinkability
is
good
though
worth
a
taste
a
reasonable
dipa
deep
amber
in
color
very
clear
with
a
decent
tan
head
nice
lace
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
i
drink
lots
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
hay
in
the
aroma
with
a
light
caramel
back
taste
is
a
balance
of
grapefruit
and
a
light
sweetness
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
hay
present
in
the
aroma
is
gone
in
the
flavor
richer
and
heavier
mouth
feel
than
the
ipa
i
had
from
these
guys
last
week
more
body
but
less
balance
good
drinkability
as
the
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
think
if
the
english
were
to
make
a
dipa
this
might
be
it
pours
a
deep
coppery
color
nose
has
some
leafy
hops
and
lemon
twinge
nicely
hopped
but
not
the
fresh
raw
oily
sticky
hoppiness
found
in
so
many
american
doubles
this
is
more
relaxed
some
crushed
pinecone
and
tree
sap
here
to
balance
a
big
biscuity
malt
middle
carbonation
is
light
and
balanced
finishes
with
some
icy
sweet
cake
frosting
and
solid
slap
of
bitterness
alcohol
hides
well
but
is
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
im
enjoying
these
heavy
seas
brews
more
and
more
and
this
is
no
exception
pretty
nice
indeed
pretty
nice
beer
not
a
palate
killer
like
many
dont
know
if
that
is
good
or
bad
for
the
style
alcohol
does
its
job
ive
been
enjoying
clipper
citys
brews
lately
and
this
is
no
exception
first
i
have
to
agree
that
this
seems
much
more
aptly
suited
to
live
its
life
as
an
ipa
not
a
dipa
but
thats
so
much
quibbling
because
its
a
tasty
beasty
no
matter
what
you
label
it
the
hops
are
crisp
and
sassy
and
never
over
the
top
even
though
they
did
tend
to
hog
the
limelight
a
bit
the
abv
is
manageable
and
it
reveals
itself
enough
to
make
sure
you
take
note
still
its
nicely
drinkable
assuming
moderation
and
it
it
makes
a
name
for
itself
in
fact
it
could
call
itself
sewer
water
and
id
still
gladly
come
back
for
more
medium
bodied
light
fruity
finish
alcohol
burn
starts
to
show
further
in
but
doesnt
flare
too
simplistic
for
the
style
but
beyond
that
not
a
bad
ipa
at
all
very
warming
inside
the
mouth
and
out
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brewery
until
recently
but
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
good
juicy
hop
flavors
excellent
balance
kinda
on
the
line
between
ipa
and
dipa
but
who
cares
its
a
damn
good
beer
light
on
the
palate
and
in
terms
of
abv
a
unique
version
of
the
style
not
aggressive
enough
for
a
hophead
somewhere
between
an
ipa
and
a
double
either
way
another
solid
offering
from
cc
and
one
i
will
look
for
on
tap
soon
enough
the
taste
is
nice
i
am
often
disappointed
by
iipas
because
they
are
not
dreadnaught
this
has
a
more
refreshing
and
complex
flavor
this
is
citrusy
piney
and
grassy
at
the
same
time
the
flavors
are
layered
not
just
a
chaotic
mess
like
some
iipas
if
you
dont
taste
the
malt
halfway
through
a
sip
youll
miss
it
it
is
quite
fleeting
this
has
a
slight
wet
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
ultra
creamy
and
smoothly
carbonated
drinkable
as
hell
except
it
is
my
only
sample
drinkability
high
im
anxious
to
get
a
six
of
this
very
good
i
found
the
contrast
between
this
and
the
sister
beer
quite
striking
both
clock
in
at
identical
7
5
percent
abv
but
the
similarities
end
there
the
loose
cannon
is
more
heavily
carbonated
light
highly
aromatic
rather
citric
tasting
and
not
too
bitter
the
winter
storm
is
none
of
these
things
maybe
if
i
was
to
make
a
5050
mixture
id
get
a
classic
dipa
a
clean
dark
amberbrown
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
beige
head
and
good
lace
there
is
a
sweet
fruity
character
to
the
aroma
with
some
hop
note
floating
around
in
there
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
background
there
is
a
small
bit
of
sweetness
with
fruity
and
vannilla
notes
at
the
front
of
your
mouth
but
all
the
action
takes
place
at
the
back
with
a
combo
of
roasted
malt
and
grapefruit
hops
making
for
a
well
balanced
finish
winter
storm
delivers
a
dark
orange
body
beneath
a
frothy
head
of
ivory
foam
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
short
walls
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
displays
clear
grapefruity
and
piney
hops
but
its
not
overtly
bold
and
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
way
its
lightly
caramelish
malt
works
in
unison
with
its
firm
bitterness
and
floralcitruspine
hop
flavors
to
deliver
a
solid
wellrounded
and
wellbalanced
beer
but
it
doesnt
hit
you
on
the
head
it
does
leave
it
quite
drinkable
however
and
the
only
thing
lacking
is
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
coming
back
again
and
again
still
this
is
a
solid
ipa
that
probably
deserves
more
attention
than
it
gets
now
for
the
taste
a
surprisingly
full
sweet
maltiness
initally
followed
by
an
almost
whiskeylike
mix
of
alcohol
and
sweet
grain
the
hops
are
certainly
there
in
the
finish
long
lingering
and
bitter
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
and
somewhat
more
complexity
than
i
was
expecting
certainly
not
the
hopbomb
expected
from
a
doubleipa
with
more
malt
character
than
others
which
i
happen
to
like
and
while
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
its
not
exactly
a
big
beer
either
not
really
a
beer
i
would
drink
all
night
but
not
a
bad
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
favorites
all
said
a
unique
brew
well
worth
trying
winter
storm
is
subtitled
category
5
ale
im
going
to
have
to
downgrade
it
to
a
much
less
dangerous
category
4
theres
a
lot
to
like
but
when
judged
against
its
peers
it
doesnt
have
enough
of
what
makes
the
dipa
style
hum
namely
hops
its
still
mighty
tasty
beer
thanks
to
meathookjones
for
the
bottle
the
finish
is
crisp
and
has
good
bittering
overall
not
too
bad
the
freshness
date
was
not
notched
poured
amber
in
color
with
a
filmy
head
fairly
high
carbonation
the
aroma
is
hops
the
taste
is
strong
in
the
hops
but
brings
to
mind
cleaning
supplies
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
and
the
alcoho
burn
is
almost
uncomfortably
high
i
think
after
a
couple
of
these
beers
my
taste
buds
will
be
shot
received
as
a
selection
of
the
beer
of
the
month
club
poured
a
deep
amber
color
head
was
a
nice
white
fluffy
color
with
good
retention
smell
gave
a
hint
of
the
hopr
to
follow
taste
was
superb
with
enough
hops
to
make
it
interesting
without
being
overpowering
alcohol
content
was
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with

medium

syrupy
mouthfeel
very
nice
amount
of
bitterness
both
upfront
and
in
the
aftertaste
for
fans
of
hops
although
it
is
balanced
out
with
an
almost
caramel
malt
flavor
as
others
have
noted
this
isnt
a
very
good
iipa
but
is
a
great
tasting
for
a
strong
ipa

ratings

me

this

is
sort

wise
this
is
a
decent
ipa
but
double
cmon
get
real
could
be
more
firm
and
crisp
to
get
a
higher
rating
from
me
does
have
a
nice
hoppy
finish
not
the
crunch
to
be
expected
from
a
top
dipa
however
and
lots
of
caramel
malts
this
is
the
best
offering
i
can
recall
trying
from
clipper
city
this
ship
rides
the
winter
storms
well
with
is
strong
body
and
complex
nose
and
taste
of

and
a

trimed
to
perfection
ill
ride
this
clipper
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
thanks
to
dithyramb
for
the
trade
this
is
either
an
awesome
ipa
or
an
average
double

either
way
it
is
a
very
good
beer
pours
dark

with
a
medium

thin

through
the
whole

at
the

the

i
like

winter
seasonal
wooo
said
the
nature
boy
frankly
i
was
sort
of
let
down
by
this
beer
after
hearing
about
it
and
having
been
impressed
with
small
craft
warning
also
from
this
heavy
seas
line
i
was
expecting
hoppy
ipa
with
a
strong
hop
aroma
presence
it
certainly
is
hoppy
but
sorely
lacks
floral
hop
aroma
also
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
fruity
malty
backbone
as
most
ipas
do
albeit
they
are
more
hoppy
than
anything
else
it
almost
seemed
like
a
overly
hopped
pilsner
rather
than
an
ale
overall
id
say
its
just
an
average
ipa
its
drinkable
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
others
out
there
pours
an
incredibly
rich
a
thick
deep
cream
colored
head
rising
2
fingers
high
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
deep
golden
amber
color
with
a
yeast
induced
haziness
the
nose
is
fresh
intense
flowery
hoppiness
with
a
nice
sweet
biscuity
malty
base
to
it
kick
ass
hop
bitterness
fills
the
mouth
along
with
thick
slightly
sweet
maltiness
the
hops
just
go
on
and
on
ending
in
a
long
drawn
out
finish
bittersweet
but
way
more
bitterdry
than
sweet
not
too
much
alcohol
sensed
here
this
ones
a
winner
oelergud
gave
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
while
at
mahars
had
not
heard
about
it
before
so
was
just
hoping
that
i
picked
something
good
to
try
well
i
got
damn
lucky
this
was
a
nice
brew
poured
to
a
somewhat
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
nice
sized
off
white
head
that
had
pretty
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
very
pronounced
citrus
like
hop
to
it
was
able
to
get
a
good
whiff
of
it
just
from
the
pour
also
can
notice
a
caramel
malt
aroma
that
is
in
the
background
but
definitely
goes
very
well
with
the
other
scents
the
taste
was
not
dominated
by
the
hoppy
characteristics
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
seems
to
be
very
well
balanced
definitely
hoppy
no
doubt
about
it
but
the
maltyness
has
a
very
strong
showing
over
all
this
is
a
excellent
brew
one
that
i
will
be
looking
for
this
is
my
first
time
having
a
brew
from
clipper
city
but
will
have
to
give
some
of
the
others
a
try
thanks
to
the
blitheringidiot
for
giving
me
a
bunch
of
these
overall
my
only
slight
complaint
would
be
that
this
one
seems
a
touch
thin
and
maybe
even
watery
at
times
other
than
that
this
is
a
flavourful
ipa
that
id
be
more
than
happy
to
pick
up
again
sail
on
and
follow
that
star

is

12

the
aroma
was
very
nice
and
the
flavor
was
well

no
particular
complexity
about
this
beer
but
pure
drinkability
does
exist
as
a
fan
of
the
heavy
seas
line
i
would
recommend
this
brew
but
only
as
a
nicely
drinkable
double
ipa
not
as
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
pours
a

good
crystal

backbone
with
some
scorchy
caramel
notes
and
lots
of
hops
and
spiciness
to
keep
the
drinker
continuously
interested
very
enjoyable
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
higher
side
but
good
clipper
city
has
impressed
me
on
this
one
had
this
back
to
back
to
back
with
this
years
hop
wallop
i
was
pressed
to
determine
which
was
better
overall
id
have
to
stick
with
the
hop
wallop
as
better
and
that
would
only
be
due
to
the
slightly
more
complex
flavor
and
mouthfeel
regardless
this
is
a
very
good
beer
winter
storm
went
well
with
several
different
foods
and
by
itself
i
could
easily
have
this
as
a
tasty
session
brew
dn
very
nicely
balanced
for
a
double
ipa
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
enough
bite
to
make
it
interesting
this
is
a
very
good
beer
imho
clipper
city
does

hoppy
yet
not
overly
so
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
a
good
balance
of
hop
flavor
yet
the
bitterness
is
a
trifle
bit
subdued
this
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
not
as
assertive
as
some
may
want
though
but
very
nice
regardless

to

as
youll
see

although
the

excellent

this
is
a
very
interested
brew
indeed
the
further
i
get
down
the
beer
the
fruitier
it
gets
and
an
almost
vanilla
flavor
comes
through
excellent
beer
well
rounded
yet
still
complex
enough
to
keep
my
interest
feels
a
little
dry
in
the
mouth
for
me
all
in
all
this
is
another
great
offering
from
clipper

hopefully
this
brewery
will
start
to
gain
some
recognition
soon

they
are

to
be
reckoned

the
tasty
treat
should
be
a
year
round
offering
finally
a
local
double

that
is
bottled
i
was
truly
excited
to
pick
up
a
6
of
this
in
the
store
for
a
great
price
pours
out
copper
with
a
tall
beige

quickly
erupting
the
head
collapses
down
to
a
rocky
terrain
as
i
drank
this
and
scattered
lacing
was
left
around
the
glass
aroma
is
full
of
citric
and
pine
hops
with
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
that
made
it
self
know
once
this
warmed
a
bit
big
taste
of
citric
bitter
hops
of
front
that
is
balanced
by
an
eventual
slightly
sweet
caramel
more
balanced
than
i
usually
like
my
double
ipas
but
it
works
out
well
here
taste
ends
with
dry
grapefruit
bitterness
body
is
about
medium
but
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
expect
it
works
here
though
were
as
a
stone
ruination
it
kind
of
detracts
from
it
overall
a
tasty
very
drinkable
treat
of
a
beer
that
i
will
be
picking
up
plenty
off
in
the
future
very
sessionable
for
a

as
well
this
poured
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
beautiful
creamy
tan
head
and
heavy
duty
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
dark
fruits
cherry
floral
hops
and
a
little
citrus
the
taste
was
really
intense
definitely
ripe
fruits
pine
and
citrus
hops
caramel
malts
just
big
and
bold
with
nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
and
although
this
brew
was
full
of
deep
and
rich
sweet
fruits
the
taste
finished
pretty
clean
and
dry
the
one
thing
that
got
me
is
that
this
is
considered
a
fruitvegetable
beer
i
mean
this
is
more
like
a
souped
up
pale
ale
with
incredibly
nice
characteristics
to
me
when
i
think
fruit
i
think
9
which
i
dont
like
i
really
like
this
and
its
being
blown
out
at
3
996
pack
ummm
ill
be
back
for
more
so
far
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
heavy
seas
line
from
clipper
city
hazy
copper
appearance
good
sized
creamy
offwhite
head
lacing
is
full
this
brew
has
a
nose
reminiscent
of
rogues
brutal
bitter
except
with
a
little
more
caramel
malt
character
its
got
a
fresh
grapefruit
like
hop
aroma
with
a
little
cannabis
mixed
in
unike
mixture
of
bready
malts
fruity
yeasts
bitter
and
somewhat
raw
hops
great
flavor
combo
for
me
body
is
a
little
better
than
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
subtle
my
first
clipper
city
and
its
a
winner
cant
wait
for
the
small
craft
warning
my
favorite
esb
not
a
bad
brew
in
taste
or
in
presentation
but
im
not
getting
enough
crisp
biscuity
notes
or
heightened
noble
hops
to
take
this
one
at
its
word
more
of
a
typical
if
still
wellmade
americanstyle
amber
ale
something
id
like
in
my
corner
when
taking
down
a
pile
o
hot
wings
malty
but
plenty
of
hops
to
balance
it
and
at
times
the
hops
take
over
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
with
ample
malt
flavor
lacking
an
overriding
sweetness
an
appreciable
esb
even
if
it
is
more
or
less
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
think
a
slightly
more
biscuity
and
buttery
apa
with
less
sweetness
and
way
less
hop
aroma
this
beer
is
hop
forward
on
the
tongue
but
still
balanced
the
aroma
is
to
style
but
a
little
faint
color
is
thinner
and
lighter
than
a
classic
esb
but
still
a
nice
hue
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
bright
i
like
the
beer
enough
to
enjoy
it
occasionally
overall
not
my
preferred
style
but
i
like
it
enough
and
dig
the
fact
that
it
is
available
in
both
bottles
and
cans
mouth
thin
and
a
little
under
carbonated
swallows
dry
but
leaves
a
lingering
astringency
on
the
tongue
a
wellbalanced
very
drinkable
beer
malts
and
hops
mingle
well
together
and
offer
a
delightful
wellrounded
beer
for
those
looking
for
a
fuller
bodied
ale
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
cap
aroma
of
stewed
hops
mineral
and
wet
dog
in
the
taste
toffee
herbal
hops
butterscotch
mild
but
persuasive
bitterness
adds
a
good
character
to
the
taste
medium
to
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
with
good
retention
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
esb
that
actually
packs
more
of
a
punch
than
most
overall
drinkability
i
didnt
expect
a
whole
lot
out
of
this
since
esbs
normally
dont
wow
me
but
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
ive
come
to
really
love
this
brewery
and
this
was
no
disappointment
at
all
given
the
subdued
nature
of
this
style
they
totally
pulled
it
off
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
tastes
very
refreshing
and
very
british
from
start
to
finish
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
day
given
the
desire
i
dont
understand
the
low
marks
on
this
one
frankly
unless
people
were
just
expecting
something
other
than
an
esb
pours
an
orange
golden
with
a
nice
foamy
cream
colored
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
floral
doughy
caramel
light
toffeea
little
lemon
and
a
kiss
of
some
grassy
hops
flavor
is
bready
and
caramel
along
with
some
mildly
bitter
grassiness
and
maybe
a
littler
herbal
a
crisp
somewhat
creamy
medium
bodied
overall
surprised
i
hadnt
rated
this
prior
but
at
least
finally
getting
around
to
it
definitely
a
solid
brew
by
ska
one
of
my
favorite
of
their
regular
offerings
o
an
enjoyable
can
of
englishstyle
ale
packing
a
ton
of
flavor
into
just
12
oz
of
lowalcohol
product
if
getting
a
sixpack
didnt
involve
crossing
state
lines
id
have
no
qualms
about
buying
a
good
bit
of
this
a
solid
all
around
esb
hops
are
more
pronounced
than
its
english
counterparts
the
citrus
plays
off
the
malt
well
and
makes
for
a
hopped
up
bready
esb
a
clean
copper
pour
with
a
finger
of
bright
white
head
which
left
behind
some
nice
lacing
and
a
nice
white
foamy
ring
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
malt
mostly
tea
leaves
slight
bitterness
reminiscent
of
grapefruit
peel
the
flavor
again
is
mostly
malt
not
getting
much
of
the
bitterness
until
the
aftertaste
but
it
isnt
of
grapefruits
this
time
around
it
is
subtle
and
almost
grassy
herbal
like
from
the
hops
medium
in
body
with
mid
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
esb
from
ska
i
can
see
this
honestly
being
excellent
on
cask
however
out
of
a
can
which
i
think
is
a
bit
too
cold
is
not
as
great
as
it
probably
could
be
a
solid
brew
that
goes
down
nicely
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
primarily
maltdriven
though
a
hint
of
hoppy
pine
makes
itself
known
the
body
is
lovely
and
velvetysmooth
it
doesnt
quite
fit
the
profile
of
an
english
esb
the
malt
character
is
less
fruity
and
complex
than
it
should
be
and
the
aromatic
hops
dont
match
the
style
either
however
it
is
certainly
very
drinkable
and
well
worth
sampling
if
you
should
come
across
it
c
an
enjoyable
esb
overall
this
has
grown
on
me
id
like
to
give
a
shake
on
tap
sometime
overall
nothing
really
special
here
but
if
the
floral
hops
and
flavor
overall
had
been
more
balanced
out
this
couldve
been
a
really
good
esb
i
grabbed
one
of
their
mixed
12
packs
yesterday
first
crack
at
this
beer
as
this
beer
is
pretty
straightforward
ill
keep
my
review
pretty
simple
it
represents
the
style
well
there
is
a
mild
lingering
bitterness
that
balances
bready
malts
this
is
a
respectable
session
ale
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
enjoyed
on
the
beach
in
the
outer
banks
a
nice
solid
all
around
beer
medium
bodied
with
some
caramel
notes
and
malty
sweetness
some
decent
hop
presence
upfront
with
a
nice
clean
finish
not
particularly
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
was
pretty
well
done
and
well
balanced
and
i
would
try
it
again
for
sure
overall
a
deliciously
well
balanced
brew
maybe
the
best
brew
ska
makes
maybe
this
is
an
interesting
esb
it
has
a
rather
bready
bold
forward
malt
character
it
has
a
very
citrusy
hop
character
its
also
a
bit
sweet
and
not
bitter
at
all
its
incredibly
drinkable
and
incredibly
refreshing
this
could
probably
pass
for
an
apa
for
most
breweries
its
worth
looking
into
a
nice
esb
definitely
americanized
with
more
aggressive
hops
a
less
of
the
subtle
malt
depth
of
the
british
variety
pours
deep
amber
with
an
offwhite

this

the

a

and
a

youre

really

it
overall

of

there
is
plenty
of

with
a
good
tingling
sensation
on
the
tongue
and
a
great
clean
finish
oh
bother
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
some
reason
even
though
i
kinda
been
taught
that
bottle
beer
is
better
i
can
honestly
argue
that
with
beers
like
this
coming
out
of
a
can
o
solid
beer
that
didnt
impress
me
at
first
but
the
longer
i
sip
it
the
more
i
like
it
d
not
being
a
real
fan
of
esbs
to
begin
with
i
found
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
most
having
said
that
the
hops
just
didnt
seem
to
be
present
in
this
one
tasting
more
like
an
amber
ale
than
anything
ill
have
to
come
back
to
this
as
i
explore
the
style
more
good
beer
and
a
great
style
i
feel
the
average
b
rating
is
partially
because
craft
drinkers
expect
more
than
the
bitter
style
delivers
what
do
i
know
though
overall
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
strongest
flagship
beers
out
there
well
that
is
if
modus
isnt
now
considered
their
flagship
beer
either
way
this
is
a
strong
readily
available
beer
if
i
am
having
a
hard
time
deciding
what
to
get
at
a
bar
i
almost
always
go
for
either
the
modus
or
the
esb
they
are
excellent
beers
particularly
for
the
price
point
at
8
99
a
6pack
and
usually
5
or
less
at
the
bar
in
chicago
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
for
your
money
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
trace
of
alcohol
i
enjoyed
this
one
second
tasting
of
the
day
from
ska
overall
this
is
a
decent
brewry
the
other
beer
was
the
motis
hop
they
seem
spot
on
with
their
own
take
on
this
esb
and
the
american
ipa
the
look
is
pretty
standard
esb
golden
brown
with
creamy
head
that
dissapates
the
smell
is
grainy
funky
although
i
prefer
more
fruit
in
the
esbs
yes
a
flaw
there
is
also
a
faint
whiff
of
alcohol
im
not
sure
why
at
this
abv
the
taste
is
malt
butter
with
a
different
hoppiness
than
an
esb
like
fullers
not
bad
great
value
for
the
12
pack
i
bought
i
dont
mind
the
cans
but
check
out
pbr
and
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
on
the
graphics
appearance
is
amber
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
the
smell
has
bread
caramel
malts
and
faint
hops
skas
esb
tastes
fairly
sweet
with
more
of
that
caramel
from
the
nose
also
some
light
tropical
fruit
its
bitterness
is
fairly
subdued
and
a
body
that
leans
towards
thin
this
is
a
decent
esb
and
it
would
quench
you
thirst
on
a
summer
day
overall
impression
brews
from
ska
are
always
above
average
but
this
one
was
right
around
the
average
esb
nothing
really
grabbed
my
attention
but
wasnt
necessarily
a
bad
brew
i
would
definitely
grab
1
or
2
of
these
when
going
on
a
float
trip
or
camping
but
would
rather
have
the
canned
modus
hoperandi
ugh
the
bitterness
was
there
but
not
accompanied
by
any
balance
or
pleasant
flavors
i
would
contend
that
the
malt
is
here
due
to
the
color
and
sweetness
but
theres
no
real
mesh
with
the
herbal
hop
flavors
and
odd
citric
notes
taste
pretty
good
some
bitter
and
hops
really
couldnt
differentiate
this
between
an
esp
and
a
pale
ale
citrus
hop
pale
and
caramel
malt
flavor
seems
like
a
pale
to
me
very
well
carbonated
a
decent
brew
nothing
groundbreaking
maybe
not
dry
enough
to
be
a
true
esb
but
ive
always
found
esbs
to
be
like
pales
with
less
hops
a
splendid
british
esb
with
an
very
gentle
american
twist
o
well
ive
downed
one
of
them
far
more
quickly
than
i
probably
should
and
im
about
to
open
another
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
british
inspired
ale
would
be
just
the
thing
on
a
cool
fall
evening
has
enough
flavor
to
be
an
interesting
beer
but
has
a
low
enough
alcohol
content
to
enjoy
more
than
one
the
beer
was
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
soapy
looking
head
it
smells
a
bit
sour
with
hints
of
lemon
and
caramel
the
taste
has
a
lemony
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
a
sweetness
that
is
washed
over
by
a
biscuit
flavor
there
is
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
it
feels
a
little
watery
the
carbonations
ok
and
the
finish
is
dry
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
it
again
its
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
drinkable
but
not
something
im
going
to
search
for
in
the
future
not
because
this
beer
is
offputting
but
because
esbs
are
not
a
beer
i
typically
enjoy
this
particular
esb
is
moderately
above
average
for
an
esb
while
it
fits
the
style
it
doesnt
offer
any
new
take
and
it
doesnt
distinguish
itself
from
the
others
can
into
a
snifter
an
esb
its
not
but
its
a
decent
beer
better
than
indicated
by
the
rating
decent
head
on
it
on
top
of
the
right
color
body
for
the
style
however
its
not
nearly
dry
enough
or
bitter
enough
this
would
be
more
properly
called
a
pale
ale
d
an
alright
brew
i
dont
think
id
have
another
one
33
pours
dark
burnt
orange
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
head
is
average
sized
but
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
some
chunky
lacing
scent
honestly
theres
not
a
whole
lot
there
some
murky
malts
but
thats
all
im
getting
taste
is
nicely
balanced
pleasantly
subtle
is
how
i
would
describe
it
earthy
malt
profile
with
some
nice
citrusy
hop
tones
up
front
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
a
clean
finish
esb
was
a
style
i
never
understood
and
then
it
clicked
today
as
to
what
exactly
it
was
supposed
to
be
and
i
felt
stupid
with
my
new
found
understanding
of
the
style
this
seems
to
be
a
good
example
goes
down
easy
and
im
happy
to
keep
throwing
them
back
got
this
in
a
variety
pack
and
definitely
could
have
gone
for
more
than
the
four
that
were
in
there
notes
would
buy
again
in
a
single
can
not
in
a
6er
not
bad
but
not
in
my
top
picks
in
its
style
if
this
was
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
i
would
have
it
it
isnt
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
man
sitting
around
shootin
the
shite
drinking
this
and
bsing
with
buds
this
works
pours
a
golden
amber
color
as
the
scent
of
hops
erupt
from
pouring
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
drinking
past
the
decent
head
there
is
a
semimild
bitter
taste
to
it
no
where
near
as
bitter
as
an
ipa
however
a
nice
hoppy
taste
that
makes
this
beer
fairly
decent
thanks
to
tr4nc3d
for
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
served
from
can
into
a
dogfish
head
signature
glass
poured
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
hops
and
a
slightly
nutty
note
the
flavor
was
of
only
sweet
malt
and
hops
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
esb
had
a
very
well
balanced
flavor
and
nice
aroma
however
i
feel
the
flavor
and
aroma
was
a
little
simple
and
not
very
complex
if
there
would
have
been
more
complexity
to
this
one
it
could
have
been
something
quite
special
still
a
nice
brew
that
i
am
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
esb
i
dont
know
if
i
would
particularly
seek
this
one
out
but
i
know
i
will
buy
it
again
at
some
point

with
some
light

aromas
of

and
grains
with
a
touch
of
hops
a
malty
citrus
on
the
palette
with
a
bitter
metallic
finish
good
carbonation
in
a
medium
body
that
paired
well
with
a
smoked
trout
pate
on
whole
wheat
toast
yeah
right
decent
enuf
brew
for
more
than
one
d
a
good
drinkable
beer
and
glad
it
is
in
cans
good
pairing
with
saltier
foods
while
this
isnt
the
most
mindblowing
esb
ive
ever
had
its
certainly
serviceable
and
gets
bonus
points
for
being
canned
if
youre
determined
to
try
one
of
skas
beers
id
point
you
towards
the
modus
hoperandi
though
you
could
certainly
do
worse
than
this
beer
it
wont
blow
your
socks
off
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
its
a
serviceable
entry
into
the
esb
category
thanks
to
woodychandler

the
trade
poured

12
oz

taste
is
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
some
grains
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
good
quality

golden
to
slightly
amber

tingle
maltly
middle
with

mouthfeel
is
a

chewy
consistent
with
style
very
drinkable
in
anything
but
very
hot
weather
very
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
not
the
best
esb
out
there
but
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
was
quite
refreshing
after
a
long
mountain
hike
pours
a
clear
copper
color
34
inch

of
an
offwhite
color
good

and
good

smells
of
pale
malt
pale

citrus

slight
sweet

hint
of
wheat
and
hint
of
spice
fits
the
style
of
an
extra
special
strong
bitter

crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale

sweet

pale

overall
good
complexity
and
blend
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
esb
the
flavor
is
toffee
malt
with
some
earthy
hops
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
grassy
hops
earthy
hops
and
some
bready
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
a
solid
bitter
pretty
much
an
american
red
ale
ok
but
not
approaching
fullers
pours
a
clear
amber
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
had
good
retention
not
as
dark
as
i
would
associate
with
an
esb
the
head
settles
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
the
aroma
is
the
mint
i
did
not
know
galena
hops
had
that
characteristic
i
also
noted
some
earthiness
citrus
and
caramel
as
well
the
flavor
is
really
earthy
and
bitter
the
malt
does
not
give
enough
input
into
the
flavor
any
sweetness
is
quickly
overpowered
by
the
hops
not
that
good
of
a
flavor
for
an
esb
not
a
fan
of
the
single
hop
profile
here
either
good
body
and
a
nice
soft
carbonation
that
seems
really
good
for
the
style
this
beer
nees
some
tweaking
to
take
into
the
good
category
still
worth
a
try
plus
it
comes
in
cans
eminently
quaffable
a
great
session
beer
can
from
chips
in
kill
devil
hills
nc
pours
to
a
very
hazy
rusty
orange
with
a
quickly
dissipating
one
finger
beige
head
nose
is
buttery
toffee
weird
while
esb
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
i
cant
say
that
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
after
that
smell
there
isnt
even
a
hint
of
hop
presence
the
hop
selection
is
too
citrusy
for
this
style
and
malt
profile
it
starts
out
with
a
nice
bitterness
but
finishes
too
dry
for
an
esb
and
has
a
very
watery
feel
to
it
this
beer
is
a
mess
from
the
bizarre
nose
to
downright
poor
ingredient
selection
i
would
honestly
drink
bmc
over
this
it
reminds
me
of
my
first
homebrew
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
a
friend
picked
up
a
can
at
chips
wine
and
beer
in
kill
devil
hills
i
like
a
good
esb
but
this
came
off
more
like
a
smooth
americn
amber
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
new
england
brewings
atlantic
amber
which
is
also
from
a
can
its
basically
a
smooth
caramel
malt
beer
that
finishes
dry
and
with
a
moderate
spicy
hop
kick
nothing
really
stands
out
here
but
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
serving
type
can
m
d
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
crisp
at
the
same
time
with
good
co2
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
very
nice
balance
in
the
flavors
very
drinkable
medium
body
lower
carbonation
i
really
like
this
malt
character
nice
beer
poured
from
the
can
into
a
shaker
pint
when
i
popped
the
tab
the
beer
rushed
out
of
the
top
and
down
the
sides
wow
a
gusher
medium
gold
color
with
some
offwhite
foam
somewhat
bready
and
sweet
with
no
real
hop
character
pretty
disappointing
actually
after
some
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
ska
overall
an
american
bitter
should
be
more
bold
with
hops
i
did
not
like
this
i
sort
of
think
i
am
being
generous
with
my
scores
maybe
because
i
do
like
this
brewery
but
this
beer
i
wont
have
again
unless
they
change
the
recipe
i
hope
they
do
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
this
beer
is
still
worth
sessionning
with
for
an
evening
d
this
one
seems
like
it
did
not
reach
its
full
potential
i
would
probably
drink
it
over
a
few
other
beers
i
know
of
but
i
will
definitely
not
be
seeking
it
out
overall
though
a
middling
beer
not
great
for
the
style
drinkable
at
least
d
goes
down
easily
decent
representation
of
the
style
not
a
blow
your
mind
away
beer
but
a
nice
one
to
sit
with
for
a
bit
a
little
hop
bite
in
the
finish
with
some
malty
sweetness
fairly
easy
drinking
this
solid
esb
from
ska
brewing
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
nice
cap
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
lace
the
nose
has
some
caramel
sweetness
along
with
some
light
grassy
hop
aromas
as
you
sip
this
there
is
a
big
upfront
bitterness
that
is
followed
by
a
strong
caramel
and
roasted
backbone
this
beer
drinks
really
easily
and
is
nice
and
sessionable
with
a
respectable
5
8
abv
i
enjoyed
this
up
and
down
easy
to
drink
delicious
and
there
are
just
not
enough
bitters
these
days
i
cannot
wait
until
this
comes
to
mo
would
i
buy
more
of
it
this
can
came
into
my
hands
through
a
friend
in
north
carolina
they
are
yet
to
distribute
their
beers
up
here
in
massachusetts
but
if
i
could
buy
it
id
probably
go
with
their
other
canned
offering
first
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
is
somewhat
off
style
but
still
good
overall
a
decent
esb
and
nice
to
see
a
canned
version
of
it
but
unless
i
need
a
can
ill
stick
with
the
local
stl
versions
the
appearance
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
pale
amber
with
a
shallow
loose
white
foam
head
that
leaves
negligible
lacing
behind
if
your
a
fan
of
bitters
youll
like
this
one
its
got
the
classic
ultra
buttery
big
rich
caramel
malt
thing
going
on
the
mouth
feel
is
nicely
carbonated
smooth
yet
on
the
lighter
side
of
a
medium
bodied
the
flavors
mirror
the
sweetness
from
the
nose
and
linger
appropriately
a
real
nice
drinker
and
very
sessionable
at
5

big
thanks
to
pops
for
the
opportunity
12
oz
can
to
glass
orangecopper
color
offwhite
head
malty
nose
taste
wise
it
seems
to
hit
the
malt
and
mineral
notes
of
english
esb
but
the
hops
stick
out
as
american
style
pale
ale
it
seemed
to
overpower
the
mix
for
me
fairly
drinkable
but
left
thinking
there
are
better
alternatives
conclusion
nothing
crazyincredible
but
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
out
of
a
can
and
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
to
boot
im
not
a
huge
esb
fan
but
i
like
ska
products
and
it
was
worth
a
try
i
hate
breaking
it
down
to
the
nth
degree
but
this
is
a
very
solid
english
style
esb
looks
pretty
good
malty
nose
more
so
than
hops
nicely
bitter
without
stepping
up
and
out
of
class
with
the
hops
very
drinkable
at
a
sane
abv
level
and
enjoyable
at
gatherings
where
you
dont
want
a
mouth
slam
of
hops
and
perhaps
have
to
drive
and
have
34
safely
this
would
make
a
great
beach
pool
brew
imo
not
being
an
esb
man
i
wasnt
sure
how
to
rate
it
at
much
above
average
in
any
category
but
i
dont
believe
even
beer
snobs
could
really
low
rate
this
brew
my
preference
is
for
more
hops
so
my
prejudice
probably
shows
perhaps
unfairly
drinkability
is
just
above
average
md
mouthfeel
is
a
moderate
thickness
with
the
perfect
level
of
carbonation
for
style
the
easy
drinking
flavor
of
this
beer
really
is
the
highlight
this
is
a
perfect
beer
when
you
want
a
simple
and
solid
beer
that
is
good
tasting
and
you
can
keep
enjoying
over
and
over
again
dgreat
drinking
beer
very
enjoyable
not
too
stout
a
decent
esb
from
ska
but
nothing
very
special
imo
way
bummed
out
at
8
50
a
6
pack
i
was
expecting
way
more
and
i
passed
over
averys
14er
for
this
mess
overall
a
decent
bitter
with
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
i
dont
normally
care
for
the
toastednutty
notes
but
this
one
was
better
than
i
remember
d
easy
to
drink
other
than
it
just
tastes
bad
the
taste
is
really
bad
all
bitter
like
a
scotch
ale
with
some
very
weird
aftertastes
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
not
drinkable
had
this
ay
sticks
and
stones
last
night
poured
a
hazed
peachlike
color
with
a
tight
12
finger
white
head
that
held
well
aromas
of
caramel
and
fruity
maltjust
a
hint
herbalgrassy
hop
well
rounded
on
the
palate
starting
out
with
caramelbiscuit
malt
with
some
fruity
estersthe
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
giving
off
some
citric
and
herbal
qualities
this
is
very
much
an
american
version
of
the
style
with
a
decent
hop
profile
in
the
finishvery
nice
drinkable
but
not
really
my
style
ive
had
this
beer
in
previous
years
and
really
liked
the
smoothness
and
drinkability
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
level
of
hop
bitterness
that
met
my
mouth
as
i
have
had
the
impression
in
the
past
that
this
beer
leaned
more
towards
a
english
esb
my
mistake
this
is
super
drinkable
wow
really
nice
i
am
hooked
a
great
us
interpretation
of
an
english
classic
well
done
and
i
enjoy
this
more
than
the
original
style
nicely
put
together
and
spot
on
for
style
very
sessionable
overall
impression
this
is
a
nice
camping
beer
plenty
drinkable
available
in
cans
but
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
very
balanced
and
drinkable
great
session
beer
nothing
that
will
blow
the
beer
world
away
but
a
classic
stand
by
that
will
appeal
to
everyone
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
esb
and
yet
another
great
canned
craft
beer
da
beer
for
any
place
you
want
the
ease
of
cans
camping
ball
games
etc
but
there
are
also
a
lot
better
beers
in
cans
these
days
so
overall
not
a
very
big
fan
of
this
esp
reminded
me
more
of
a
pale
ale
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
not
something
i
would
completely
ignore
good
color
that
is
a
shade
under
orange
with
a
chunky
head
that
leaves
intermittent
lacing
more
floral
hops
in
the
nose
than
there
are
in
the
taste
it
set
me
up
for
a
hoppy
brew
that
turned
out
to
be
malt
dominated
bready
and
sweet
notes
throughout
with
a
roasted
malt
type
of
residual
aftertaste
its
good
though
carbonation
leads
to
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
that
i
really
enjoyed
drinkable
enough
i
like
the
style
and
thought
this
was
a
good
representation
pick
it
up
if
you
get
a
chance
easy
to
drink
this
beer
went
down
quicker
than
i
expected
this
beer
is
a
sessionable
one
drinkability
super
tasty
esb
in
a
can
hell
yea
mang
love
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
this
is
it
drinkability
good
smooth
drinking
beer
dangerously
sessionable
drinkability
is
so
so
i
only
picked
up
a
single
but
the
beer
has
a
good
full
flavor
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
life
i
will
check
this
out
again
overall
good
drinkability
nice
sweet
flavors
balanced
with
bitterness
and
roasted
maltbiscuit
flavors
nice
and
tame
flavors
that
all
combine
well
together
overall
a
tasty
and
certainly
hop
forward
esb
future
outlook
not
available
here
so
moot
poured
into
tulip
out
of
the
fridge
produced
a
shortlived
small
head
over
clouded
gold
color
smell
was
hop
mild
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
end
taste
was
similar
bitterness
came
toward
the
later
third
of
the
tasting
not
overpowering
decently
balanced
overall
mouthfeel
was
good
and
at
a
lower
abv
its
quite
drinkable
maybe
not
my
favorite
but
would
have
it
again
skas
esb
special
ale
was
americas
second
canned
microbrew
oskar
blues
dales
pale
ale
was
the
first
it
isnt
as
good
as
that
hoppy
treat
but
its
no
slouch
either
changes
in
the
grain
bill
and
the
hop
bill
would
probably
put
it
right
in
my
wheelhouse
d
good
to
see
more
breweries
canning
but
this
beer
is
average
at
best
a
very
soft
take
on
a
great
style
of
beer
very
easy
drinking
sessionable
if
not
boring
along
with
90
shilling
and
laughing
lab
this
is
one
of
the
best
session
brews
in
the
state
drinkability
is
fairly
high
easily
sessionable
with
presumeably
low
abv
and
a
nice
flavor
profile
when
poured
into
a
glass
the
foam
was
light
wheat
in
color
somewhat
thick
and
lacey
the
color
was
a
nice
honey
and
gold
in
the
light
the
smell
was
very
fruity
and
had
a
bit
tartness
to
it
the
taste
had
a
blandish
fruity
overtone
with
a
nice
hops
undertone
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
clean
and
smooth
drinkability
went
down
the
gullet
well
and
had
a
good
session
this
brew
pours
up
an
apricot
color
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
the
nose
is
a
total
fruit
basket
composed
of
overripe
peach
pineapple
tangerine
honeydew
kiwi
sweet
pale
malts
very
floral
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
more
malt
than
hops
but
a
subtle
hop
finish
it
needs
more
hops
to
be
an
esb
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
more
like
a
traditional
english
bitter
medium
body
low
carbo
not
too
shabby
after
dissapointments
with
my
first
two
ska
offerings
their
special
esb
delivers
it
must
be
the
cans
the
flavor
is
similarly
light
and
pleasant
sweet
overall
with
enough
berry
and
citric
fruit
to
make
it
interesting
good
use
of
a
british
yeast
to
add
a
little
complexity
but
overall
its
pretty
middle
of
the
road
not
a
bad
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
though
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
still
its
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
around
d
a
good
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
nice
flavors
and
not
overwhelming
good
beer
all
around
i
enjoy
it
more
out
of
the
can
than
pouring
it
into
a
glass
though
id
recommend
it
possible
a
good
gateway
beer
because
you
have
a
bit
of
complexity
without
the
fear
for
some
of
a
heavy
high
alcohol
possibly
too
dark
craft
beer
that
may
turn
away
your
neighbor
wife
long
lost
friend
fill
in
the
person
that
you
desperately
want
to
share
good
beer
with
thanks
for
the
recommendation
travis
the
can
poured
deep
amber
orange
with
a
moderate
amount
of
sticky
orange
hued
head
it
smells
of
juicy
citrus
and
caramel
i
would
not
peg
this
as
esb
its
fairly
sweet
with
barely
detectable
hops
i
dont
see
a
date
on
the
can
anywhere
but
i
would
like
to
think
that
other
samples
are
better
i
love
other
brews
from
ska
the
mouthfeel
is
what
i
would
expect
from
the
genre
full
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
a
distraction
from
the
flavors
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
sit
for
a
session
with
pours
a
very
nice
cloudy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
bitter
with
some
slight
spice
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
bitter
with
some
slight
spice
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
side
of
medium
with
carbonation
also
on
the
light
side
beachshore
bet
it
is
nice
to
see
something
different
in
a
can
well
done
another
good
beer
from
ska
and
i
didnt
get
a
glass
full
of
wax
as
often
happens
with
the
bombers
brillantly
clear
copper
poured
into
a
nonic
creamy
quickly
dimishing
white
head
subtle
aromas
of
toffee
buttered
bread
and
a
hint
of
vague
fruit
and
nuts
taste
was
spoton
for
an
esb
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
moderate
bitterness
creamy
lightbodied
with
a
drying
finish
not
too
watery
but
still
just
a
bit
thin
but
fine
for
the
style
quite
sessionable
hardly
any
bubbling
light
head
but
a
little
sticky
lacing
on
my
glass
a
preety
average
looking
english
ale
the
aroma
is
a
light
bread
carame
and
pale
malt
ith
some
subtle
hops
the
taste
is
just
as
engihy
subtle
you
can
taste
the
malts
the
best
but
their
not
heay
or
bland
just
enough
to
notice
the
malts
and
hops
so
you
can
keep
driniking
this
beer
over
and
over
again
smooth
malt
and
hops
with
a
tangy
and
sticky
finish
that
tays
on
the
tongue
fr
quite
some
time
skas
now
holds
claim
to
producing
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
had
and
certainly
the
finest
canned
version
of
the
style
to
date
recommended
for
camping
trips
and
hot
summer
days
when
a
pilsner
just
wont
cut
it
d
one
of
skas
better
brews
imho
but
still
just
decent
not
as
balanced
as
im
used
to
esbs
being
sweet
and
nutty
aroma
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
thai
peanut
sauce
light
bitterness
and
nutty
malt
in
the
flavor
lightbodied
and
clean
it
would
probably
be
easy
to
have
a
couple
lower
carbonation
with
a
nutty
residual
aftertaste
aroma
was
a
little
metallic
at
first
but
it
blew
off
quickly
its
not
bad
but
im
not
sure
that
this
is
one
id
go
for
again
d
im
in
awe
of
this
brew
and
its
in
a
can
a
kick
ass
session
brew
and
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
ever
had
honestly
this
may
be
my
favorite
session
beer
of
all
time
other
than
dead
guy
nice
flavors
caramelly
and
creamy
good
hop
bitterness
overall
pleasing
taste
this
is
certainly
a
stellar
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
park
or
mind
blowing
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
take
camping
in
the
summer
since
it
is
canned
and
pretty
damn
tasty
beer
pours
a
honey
amber
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
that
has
sustained
well
nose
is
malty
with
hints
of
sweet
fruit
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
lingering
in
the
background
finishing
with
a
very
light
hop
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
somewhat
smooth
drinkability
is
good
i
am
glad
i
recently
picked
up
a
sixer
for
my
next
tailgate
this
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
mouthfeeloh
yes
this
is
going
to
be
good
light
hoppy
flavor
with
a
subtle
citrus
note
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
sharp
bitterness
the
malt
profile
is
perfect
for
an
esb
not
too
sweet
but
its
there
with
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
that
is
not
overbearing
this
is
ale
im
rating
this
high
becuase
it
smelled
and
tasted
great
and
is
very
quaffable
one
of
the
best
esbs
i
have
tried
in
a
good
while
and
cheers
to
ska
for
canning
it
an
overall
good
experience
from
a
beer
i
didnt
expect
much
from
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
head
and
good
carbonation
leaving
some
lacing
smell
was
of
caramel
malts
and
a
slight
hop
presence
slightly
fruity
also
taste
was
solid
all
around
caramel
is
again
present
with
a
biscuity
flavor
that
is
well
pronounced
a
little
bitter
hop
bite
does
well
to
provide
good
balance
close
to
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
good
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
cans
of
this
one
d
quite
quaffable
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
still
enjoy
it
an
above
average
esb
thats
recommended
there
are
much
better
esbs
out
there
but
few
that
are
this
drinkable
skas
esb
pours
a
handsome
amber
robe
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
patches
of
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
its
hoppy
and
malty
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
leafygrassiness
followed
by
some
very
pleasant
berrylike
fruitiness
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
at
all
if
they
were
using
the
fullers
yeast
strain
white
labs
wlp002
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
and
lightly
crisp
with
a
moderate
fine
bubbled
carbonation
at
around
2
38
volumes
co2
the
flavor
is
round
and
very
wellbalanced
between
delicate
english
hops
and
softly
caramelish
and
biscuity
malt
but
theres
also
a
delicate
note
of
chocolate
that
gives
it
quite
a
bit
of
charm
its
moderately
bitter
and
finishes
fairly
quick
and
dry
with
just
a
bit
of
leafy
spicy
floral
and
grassy
hops
left
behind
very
nicely
done
and
quite
drinkable
poured
from
a
12oz
can
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
beautiful
golden
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
offwhite
foam
the
head
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
followed
by
biscuit
and
fruit
apple
notes
taste
is
malty
at
first
followed
by
a
nice
dose
of
hops
more
malts
and
maybe
some
tropical
fruit
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
thanks
to
limesmut
for
this
fine
beer
its
not
too
often
you
see
an
esb
in
a
can
i
would
certainly
drink
this
one
again
if
i
have
the
chance
thanks
to
bitterbill
for
including
this
one
the
flavor
is
balanced
and
drinkable
with
nice
hop
and
malt
flavors
a
well
made
and
drinkable
beer
edit
a
bought
another
6er
recently
and
theres
some
nice
fruity
tones
i
did
not
notice
during
my
original
review
im
guessing
that
these
are
fresher
samples
and
man
the
fruitiness
combined
with
the
delicious
maltiness
and
just
a
slight
bitterness
near
the
finish
makes
this
much
more
tasty
new

12
oz
can

i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
orange
color
and
cloudy
smell
was
malty
the
taste
was
metallic
yeasty
and
not
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
had
a
grittiness
to
it
that
i
did
not
like
i
hope
this
was
an
old
one
or
something
cause
it
was
not
good
at
all
peachy

not
bad
moderate

with
a
soft
feel
this
beer
is
a
little
weak
for
the
style
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
the
beer
is
a
lighter
orange
with
a
fair
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
sweet
the
taste
is
subdued
hops
as
in
the
bitterness
is
not
overwhelming
a
good
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
back
a
sixer
of
these
and
come
sunday
at
the
food
city
500
i
will
likely
do
just
that
it
is
nice
to
see
some
craft
beer
in
cans
for
sporting
events
and
the
like
poured
from
the
can
a
cloudy
copper
brew
with
a
mid
sized
off
white
head
aroma
was
mild
with
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hops
taste
was
also
caramel
malts
and
earthy
hops
decent
balance
the
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
far
from
the
best
good
carbonation
slight
oil
coats
the
mouth
but
is
barely
noticeable
goes
down
easy
this
could
become
a
fall
back
beer
for
me
since
its
becoming
more
prevalent
around
here
definitely
a
good
drinking
beer
very
nice
drinkability
goes
down
very
smooth
and
definately
a
good
session
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
i
wouldnt
mind
taking
camping
and
sitting
around
the
fire
with
12
oz
can
received
from
zorro
in
bcg
bif
i
wish
more
micros
around
here
would
can
a
beer
for
us
outdoorsmen
cloudy
dark
orange
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
falls
to
a
contoured
table
of
bubbles
some
columns
of
big
bubble
carbonation
rise
slowly
up
smell
is
a
raw
perfumey
hops
not
overpowering
but
present
before
any
malts
smell
is
initially
sweet
then
gives
way
immediately
to
astringent
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
maybe
a
maltier
character
to
match
the
vinous
hoppiness
yet
this
is
not
a
hop
monster
by
any
means
not
a
bad
drinker
here
and
one
of
the
few
microbrews
that
comes
in
cans
especially
for
camping
and
the
outdoors
what
would
have
made
this
a
better
brew
esbs
are
a
style
about
which
i
feel
rather
flexible
but
i
think
that
the
biggest
issue
here
is
the
lack
of
balance
between
hops
and
carmel
malts
a
nice
esb
should
have
a
good
sweet
body
matched
with
a
nice
dose
of
hoppiness
a
yin
and
yang
of
style
that
unfortunately
isnt
to
be
found
in
this
can
clear

malty

with

and
some

woody
nutty
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of

nicely
balanced
the
flavor
opens
with

kinda
biscuity
and
grainy
mild
pear
esters
with
a
sharp
wooden
feel
throughout
woody
floral

in
the
finish
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
some
caramel
sweetness
although
the
woody
nutty
flavor
seems
to
dominate
nice
stuff
well
balanced
but
i
could
stand
for
a
bit
more
alelike
fruitiness
i
usually
like
that
in
esb
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
cool
to
see
good
beer
in
a
can
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
these
ska
beers
and
lucky
me
ive
got
a
boxfull
head

off

nice

around

pours
a
brilliantly
clear
redcopper
color
with
a
frothy
light
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
spicy
with
notes
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
herbal
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
and
finishes
with
a
mellow
bitterness
this
beer
is
quite
light
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
balance
between
a
caramel
grain
note
and
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
as
it
warms
and
sits
on
my
palate
a
hint
of
toasty
malt
character
begins
to
develop
this
beer
is
quite
the
quaffer
and
is
definitely
a
session
type
brew
though
i
would
like
to
see
a
just
a
hint
more
hop
character
to
balance
the
malt
and
a
bit
more
fruity
yeast
character
though
this
is
certainly
in
line
with
a
british
special
bitter
carbonation
level
was
a
bit
high
for
the
style
but
nice
for
a
summer
canned
beer
would
probbly
be
wonderful
in
a
cask
i
will
definitely
stock
up
on
these
cans
for
the

this
summer

the

the

is
mildly
acidic
and
the
hops
personable
in
their

aftertaste
is
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
a
decent
drinking
beer
and
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
i
like
this
one
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
very
tasty
overall
this
is
a
really
rich
malty
ale
with
a
very
strong

and
lingering

much
drier
than
i
associate
with
the

and
a

than
i
typically
associate
with

but
nice
i
love
the

and
like
the

dont

a

o

nothing
exciting
going
on
here
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
autumn
ales
a
fairly
enjoyable
albeit
forgettable
beer
from
shorts
i
love
the
label
on
it
the
beer
looks
great
when
its
poured
and
it
has
a
decent
flavor
but
theres
just
not
enough
depth
to
really
keep
my
interest
regardless
of
that
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
while
watching
the
leaves
fall
sometimes
i
dont
enjoy
a
taste
of
a
particular
beer
as
much
as
i
enjoy
the
bits
of
nostalgia
i
get
from
it
this
is
one
of
those
beers
just
makes
me
think
about
jumping
into
a
pile
of
fallen
leaves
i
think
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
actually
sort
of
captures
that
as
weird
as
that
sounds
it
really
leans
dry
all
the
way
downright
woolly
on
the
palate
at
times
leading
into
the
leafywoody
finish
it
is
nicely
crisp
and
theres
something
keeping
the
dryness
from
going
overboard
its
clean
enough
to
be
pretty
smooth
underneath
o
solid
offering
i
would
have
this
again
o
on
the
hoppybitter
side
for
an
esb
definitely
americanized
pretty
plain
and
simple
largely
unspectacular
drying
bitterness
actually
detracts
here
from
the
drinkability
of
a
normal
esb
it
seems
pretty
decent
regardless
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
grapevine
liquor
in
denver
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
easy
to
drink
not
bad
o
a
decent
beer
not
really
the
most
exciting
style
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
several
of
these
to
session
o
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
will
continue
to
buy
sixers
of
this
magical
beverage
until
they
run
out
and
am
forced
to
wait
until
next
year
the
esb
style
may
have
some
of
the
most
diverse
interpretations
some
are
malt
driven
while
others
push
the
envelope
with
hoppy
bitterness
this
one
straddles
the
middle
while
not
hugely
complex
in
flavor
the
flavor
profile
keeps
it
interesting
an
ideal
quaffer
for
the
beginning
of
autumn
o
not
bad
better
than
the
average
autumn
brew
it
is
definitely
more
of
an
esb
than
a
autumn
ale
to
me
most
of
shorts
beers
taste
the
same
hoppy
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
overall
a
win
for
shorts
brewing
again
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
gigantic
white
head
looks
like
this
may
be
another
shorts
beer
with
infection
issues
the
aroma
confirms
what
i
expected
there
is
something
off
with
this
bottle
i
get
some
toffee
and
caramel
notes
in
the
aroma
but
i
also
get
a
funky
note
i
cant
really
identify
the
flavor
is
similar
with
some
iced
tea
toffee
and
lighter
bitterness
as
well
as
some
light
funk
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
unusual
style
need
a
bit
more
malt
odd
style
for
an
autumn
ale
m
light
leading
to
medium
overall
if
i
was
a
local
i
would
consider
getting
it
again
but
to
go
through
the
trouble
of
shipping
from
mi
it
wouldnt
be
worth
a
repeat
visit
poured
from
undated
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
1
finger
bubbly
head
some
retention
and
lacing
but
not
much
to
report
the
aroma
is
very
malt
forward
with
hints
of
toasted
barley
toffee
and
sweetness
a
mild
hop
character
as
well
earthy
the
flavor
also
starts
with
a
heavy
dose
of
toasted
malt
toffee
sweetness
mildly
bitter
with
a
medium
blend
of
earthy
hops
the
beer
finishes
light
smooth
and
a
lingering
raisinesque
sweetness
easy
drinking
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
overall
more
malts
than
i
anticipated
from
an
esb
though
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
solid
overall
im
not
a
fan
it
tastes
like
a
hoppy
maple
cola
im
wondering
if
this
is
an
old
bottle
by
this
point
in
the
yearwish
i
could
find
a
bottledon
date
as
i
just
purchased
this
for
consumption
should
know
better
to
drink
an
autumn
ale
now
since
its
december
o
not
enjoying
overly
hoppy
beers
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
thought
it
was
interesting
enough
to
try
again
the
hops
and
malt
interplay
well
good
for
someone
trying
to
get
into
hops
perhaps
an
easydrinking
amber
from
shorts
o
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
one
you
could
have
one
or
two
of
but
doesnt
really
have
drinkability
of
a
lot
of
the
other
shorts
brews
o
overall
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
relax
and
just
chill
not
to
high
of
abv
borderline
sessionable
an
amber
colored
esb
with
a
lovely
1
and
a
half
inch
head
smells
like
an
english
pale
ale
with
dusty
malts
and
caramel
notes
tastes
fresher
and
more
crisp
than
the
nose
with
a
moderate
hop
bouquet
in
the
finish
not
your
usual
fall
beer
but
i
like
this
one
for
the
season
a
bit
filling
with
a
heavier
body
keeps
it
from
being
a
great
session
but
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
good
beer
my
first
from
shorts
overall
i
love
shorts
but
this
beer
sucksthey
are
my
favorite
mi
brewer
but
this
is
nothing
to
brag
about
if
i
wanted
an
esb
i
would
take
southern
tiers
harvest
which
is
actually
bitter
i
notice
more
than
usual
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
which
makes
me
feel
like
its
a
homebrew
brown
amber
color
with
about
a
half
finger
of
head
a
medium
amount
of
bubbles
float
to
the
top
the
smell
reminds
me
of
melted
butter
and
slight
vinegar
ive
had
bloody
beer
before
from
shorts
and
it
actually
reminded
me
of
it
a
bit
the
smell
is
a
little
offputting
the
taste
has
a
nice
bitterness
up
front
then
followed
by
a
surprising
earthiness
a
nice
combination
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
seems
appropriate
overall
interesting
taste
and
the
smell
is
a
little
strange
im
not
sure
i
would
get
this
every
year
picked
this
up
in
a
mixed
of
shorts
for
11
overpriced
tanorange
color
with
a
white
head
looks
good
smells
like
a
malty
esb
but
nothing
jumps
out
as
special
average
taste
is
malty
and
reminds
me
of
an
english
esb
so
thats
good
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
for
11
i
expect
a
lot
more
aroma
has
a
blend
of
hops
and
caramel
the
hops
give
hints
of
citrus
and
floral
but
tend
to
lean
more
toward
earthy
and
this
gives
a
nice
segue
to
the
caramel
bready
and
a
bit
sticky
some
herbal
notes
just
when
i
think
itll
become
a
scottish
beer
the
hops
provide
a
detour
nice
feel
to
it
throughout
perhaps
a
bit
more
citrusy
than
a
regular
esb
but
still
quite
nice
pours
a
very
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
a
fruity
earthy
aroma
taste
is
a
mellow
herbal
start
followed
by
a
juicy
dark
fruit
middle
and
a
raw
clinging
hop
finish
hop
resins
cling
to
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
an
excellent
beer
overall
not
great
weird
spices
and
some
hot
pepper
heat
hops
are
there
but
not
great
malts
are
just
not
great
either
which
may
be
the
spices
overpowering
and
making
them
taste
weird
but
meh
o
perfect
with
a
sharp
cheddar
cheese
this
brew
needs
more
balls
its
lacking
significant
malt
and
hop
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
special
a
small
step
above
average
m
the
finish
disregards
the
worse
aspects
of
the
ale
leaving
a
wall
of
citrusy
hops
to
linger
that
saves
the
ale
in
my
opinion
rendering
it
drinkable
burps
bring
the
hoppiness
back
to
the
forefront
o
drinkability
is
ok
i
was
bummed
taste
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
nose
glad
i
tried
it
and
moving
on
just
hanging
on
to
a
3
5
love
shorts
the
style
but
this
one
elicits
the
shrug
of
a
phillip
k
dick
novel
as
in
what
the
hell
was
that
messy
beer
that
lacks
cohesion
more
importantly
great
taste
a
bogey
above
mediocre
o
good
esb
though
the
look
hazycloudy
was
a
little
odd
overall
a
really
nice
esb
but
definately
different
to
others
ive
had
o
i
dont
know
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
like
it
was
trying
to
sneak
in
as
a
light
pale
ale
rather
than
a
esb
and
it
didnt
translate
for
me
o
the
hops
seem
to
take
center
stage
on
this
one
lots
of
floral
aroma
and
taste
worth
a
try
i
have
not
had
many
esbs
so
take
this
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
i
was
not
horribly
motivated
to
finish
this
bottle
o
wow
i
honestly
cant
believe
all
the
reviews
below
mine
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
has
an
amazing
flavor
and
aroma
and
is
such
a
well
balanced
beer
definitely
one
of
my
top
ten
beers
of
all
time
o
pretty
decent
representation
for
the
style
has
quite
the
english
tone
to
it
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
to
make
it
a
bit
more
lively
note
when
pour
and
let
sit
for
a
while
the
carbonation
situation
went
away
and
the
beer
was
actually
a
bit
flat
i
dont
know
if
thats
a
sign
about
anything
but
that
is
what
happened
i
almost
want
to
give
this
beer
another
shot
in
case
it
was
just
a
bad
batch
but
im
not
sure
if
it
would
even
be
worth
it
o
another
screw
up
from
shorts
a
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
has
good
retention
decent
lacing
and
moderate
carbonation
it
had
a
caramel
and
sweet
malt
nose
with
hints
of
hops
the
taste
started
out
with
caramel
that
stays
throughout
the
entire
drink
i
got
a
biscuit
taste
at
the
beginning
and
hints
of
citrus
hops
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
say
i
have
had
better
esbs
than
this
but
this
is
not
bad
and
next
time
i
go
to
shorts
i
might
get
one
at
the
most
overall
interesting
but
ill
probably
not
go
down
this
road
again
overall
not
bad
though
the
tart
notes
set
it
apart
for
me
o
this
is
a
very
great
esb
in
my
opinion
i
loved
how
this
beer
just
blew
away
most
of
my
expectations
shorts
is
known
for
brewing
weirder
beers
and
this
one
just
shows
you
they
can
make
a
nice
sessionable
style
as
well
overall
i
never
get
these
shorts
beer
each
offering
seems
to
be
one
and
done
odd
but
not
in
a
good
way
like
going
to
a
freak
show
or
something
good
to
see
the
bearded
lady
but
you
dont
ever
want
to
see
her
again
i
guess
o
im
usually
a
shorts
fan
and
have
enjoyed
most
everything
ive
tried
by
them
with
a
couple
of
exceptions
i
have
to
say
this
one
really
doesnt
work
for
me
glad
to
try
it
but
this
is
definitely
a
one
and
done
for
me
ostale
bottle
dating
helps
for
the
most
part
this
was
an
average
to
pretty
good
esb
there
were
a
couple
of
things
that
stood
out
to
me
though
mainly
the
fruity
hop
aroma
and
the
small
strange
hint
of
sourness
both
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
whatever
it
was
about
that
taste
it
kept
me
coming
back
and
what
could
have
been
another
harvest
ale
turned
into
a
memorable
brew
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
again
this
fall
d
not
too
bad
to
drink
just
not
my
favorite
one
d
moderately
high
wow
this
beer
is
tasty
i
was
not
sure
how
i
would
like
this
one
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
worth
taking
for
a
spin
not
bad
but
this
is
not
a
standout
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
nice
amount
of
spotty
lacing
as
the
beer
falls
down
into
a
nice
cap
and
collar
then
the
nose
well
its
another
infected
shorts
beer
as
much
as
id
like
to
just
grab
another
and
ignore
this
ive
simply
had
way
too
many
beers
from
shorts
that
are
infected
to
excuse
this
isnt
just
a
bottle
here
and
there
there
is
some
caramel
sweetness
in
the
background
but
mostly
some
lactic
and
acetic
character
the
taste
really
doesnt
helpits
just
plain
terrible
with
sourness
as
the
only
thing
that
is
really
present
the
mouthfeel
is
acetic
and
gross
low
carbonation
as
well
just
bad
i
really
cant
understand
how
this
is
still
going
on
its
quite
a
problem
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
i
normally
dont
drink
too
many
esbs
but
this
brew
might
make
me
give
this
style
a
second
look
i
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
to
see
if
it
is
bitterer
a
good
brew
from
a
great
brewery
it
is
possible
or
rather
likely
this
beer
may
be
past
its
prime
i
dont
know
anything
avout
shorts
bottle
dating
so
i
wont
know
for
sure
the
hops
again
are
very
mild
although
they
do
trail
all
the
way
through
until
just
about
the
end
i
just
feel
this
beer
is
a
little
watery
no
one
aspect
of
it
really
punches
its
way
through
to
impress
the
malt
hop
balance
is
ok
i
guess
but
towards
the
finish
it
all
just
drops
off
the
watery
aspect
just
kills
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
for
me
maybe
ill
try
to
get
a
definite
fresh
one
next
year
reviewed
on
6292010
on
tap
at
shorts
pours
a
deep
clear
ruby
red
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
jam
and
lots
of
fruits
flavor
is
equally
fruity
and
robust
with
sweet
malt
very
malt
dominant
it
was
described
at
the
brewery
as
a
strong
bitter
but
left
me
hoping
for
some
more
hoppy
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
below
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
bing
below
average
as
well
drinkability
isnt
that
great
the
tart
and
fruity
flavors
just
didnt
work
for
me
and
didnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
referenced
on
the
bottle
at
all
either
not
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
shorts
d
very
drinkable
kinda
high
alcohol
for
a
session
beer
but
very
tasty
would
not
buy
again
bottle
from
champagne
cellars
ours
medium
golden
a
tinge
of
mahogoney
with
thick
soapy
offwhite
head
and
later
thick
rings
of
lace
hoppy
armas
initially
rich
caramel
and
good
english
bitterness
orange
taste
some
sourness
in
the
finish
uh
oh
drinkability
but
a
sipper
because
of
the
moderate
sourness
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
scent
was
stellar
and
the
flavor
was
solid
too
recommended
d
good
overall
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
this
is
a
brew
to
have
a
few
pints
of
while
you
warm
up
in
a
pub
with
some
friends
good
overall
but
not
outstanding
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
and
moderatelyhopped
beer
for
the
style
worth
a
shot
d
flavor
complexity
bitterness
and
low
abv
make
this
one
pretty
drinkable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
with
a
definite
british
feel
with
a
few
tweaks
this
could
be
a
really
good
one
i
like
it
better
this
year
a
nice
solid
brew
i
would
buy
it
again
now
that
they
have
sorted
out
some
of
their
bottling
issues
overall
a
very
unique
esb
i
like
it
but
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
an
esb
another
odd
take
on
a
style
by
shorts
decent
drinkability
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazed
deeper
amber
orange
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
an
odd
mixture
of
grass
biscuit
hops
with
some
citrus
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
start
transitions
to
an
almost
lemontea
spice
flavor
that
then
move
to
a
lingering
bitterness
it
really
does
reming
me
of
a
tea
heavy
arnold
palmer
good
head
retention
with
good
lace
this
is
a
very
different
esb
than
i
have
ever
head
not
really
in
a
bad
way
but
just
way
different
overall
one
of
the
finest
tasting
and
easist
drinking
seasonals
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
really
very
very
well
done
cheers
taste
tart
fruity
flavor
good
bitterness
really
smooth
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
very
good
though
just
goes
down
like
water
there
is
no
desire
to
savor
the
flavor
because
it
goes
down
so
well
this
is
a
beer
that
does
not
rate
super
high
but
is
quite
enjoyable
to
me
just
a
solid
beer
to
session
perfect
for
fall
received
as
part
of
a
recent
trade
surprised
to
see
this
a
comparatively
normal
beer
from
shorts
that
said
overall
im
not
all
that
impressed
with
this
one
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
minimal
tan
colored
head
very
pleasant
nose
with
floral
hops
orange
zest
and
cotton
candy
however
this
one
falls
apart
on
the
palate
after
a
very
enjoyable
first
sip
or
two
this
one
becomes
somewhat
sour
very
bitter
and
a
little
soapy
first
really
unimpressive
beer
ive
had
from
shorts
overall
just
this
side
of
a
drain
pour
drinkability
unbelievable
i
only
have
one
of
these
and
am
doing
my
best
to
enjoy
it
and
i
sure
am
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
just
damn
so
perfect
together
i
want
to
move
to
michigan
near
shorts
when
i
retire
oh
the
irony
how
i
am
still
in
grad
school
and
am
yet
to
even
start
work
yet
here
i
talk
about
retiring
so
i
can
enjoy
their
beers
all
the
time
and
on
tap
thanks
again
to
erik
for
hooking
me
up
with
tons
of
shorts
brews
i
cant
wait
to
dive
into
drinkability
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
not
detectable
it
just
feels
a
little
onedimensional
to
me
im
not
sure
it
catches
my
attention
enough
to
indulge
in
much
more
than
one
poured
a
murky
amber
with
a
tannish
head
smells
like
the
caramel
apple
section
in
the
apple
orchard
on
a
fall
day
caramel
and
fruit
maybe
even
donuts
taste
is
subdued
compared
to
smell
but
is
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
caramel
malt
fruit
and
grain
id
say
lightly
carbonated
and
thicker
than
average
mouthfeel
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
gray
october
night
toasted
malts
lead
to
pulpy
fruit
and
light
toffee
malt
citrus
hop
overtones
along
with
a
little
pine
and
some
herbal
bitterness
citrus
fruit
finish
with
a
nice
balance
between
fruitiness
and
bitterness
moderate
body
with
a
slick
lowcarbonated
feel
caskish
out
of
a
bottle
nice
hop
burps
from
this
one
too
d
esb
means
balance
and
drinkability
to
me
this
hit
it
head
on
its
tweaked
without
losing
esb
qualities
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
if
it
werent
a
fall
seasonal
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
in
my
yearround
rotation
d
pretty
good
here
this
one
is
light
interesting
and
goes
down
easy
not
ground
breaking
by
any
means
or
all
that
extreme
but
a
pretty
good
beer
from
shorts
d
low
abv
and
very
refreshing
i
could
drink
several
of
these
for
sure
d
overall
this
not
a
particularly
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
although
it
drinks
decently
well
not
one
of
shorts
better
offerings
overall
an
utterly
fantastic
rendition
of
a
hard
to
nail
style
shorts
really
got
it
right
with
this
esb
i
adore
the
paradox
of
the
sweet
fruity
malty
nose
and
the
bitter
dry
texturesflavors
a
masterfully
crafted
english
special
bitter
that
would
make
our
fellow
ba
ding
proud
for
sure
too
bad
im
only
an
inperson
trader
good
stuff
here
not
sure
how
this
rates
to
style
not
too
familiar
with
esbs
this
is
great
though
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
dark
burnt
orange
light
brown
color
well
carbonated
with
a
slight
head
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
grapefruit
taste
is
a
crisp
mix
of
of
citrus
and
caramel
malts
theres
a
lot
of
lemon
in
the
flavor
well
carbonated
light
bodied
and
excellent
drinkability
d
fairly
drinkable
helped
by
the
hop
presence
alcohol
is
not
an
issue
flavor
is
not
incredibly
complex
but
somewhat
interesting
pours
a
cloudy
brown
colored
body
light
brown
with
a
white
colored
head
has
a
fruity
aroma
with
maybe
some
hops
a
nice
hoppy
fruity
spicy
pumpkiny
taste
very
tasty
balanced
aftertaste
pours
out
to
a
cloudy
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
that
of
malt
and
bread
dough
the
taste
is
quite
good
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
present
all
the
way
through
the
taste
to
the
swallow
but
backed
up
by
a
bready
malt
balance
a
very
nice
seasonal
from
a
very
good
michigan
micro
overall
this
is
nothing
worth
mentioning
an
overall
light
profile
leaves
me
bored
boorrriing
if
you
have
the
opportunity
give
it
a
try
i
wouldnt
run
out
to
the
store
specifically
looking
for
it
but
its
a
nice
seasonal
beer
with
a
unique
twist
there
is
a
little
dry
herbal
spruce
spice
in
the
aftertaste
but
its
masked
by
a
general
watery
soggy
grain
flavor
as
it
warms
theres
some
low
level
crackery
malt
but
its
pretty
mild
overall
light
bodied
a
little
thin
nothing
special
but
if
you
love
spruce
beers
give
it
a
try
pours
a
light
orange
with
and
off
white
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
not
very
strong
but
it
is
mainly
the
spruce
and
a
sweet
malt
the
taste
starts
with
the
spruce
not
overpowering
but
still
the
main
focus
to
the
beer
a
nice
sweet
malt
starts
but
a
bitter
finish
with
a
dry
aftertaste
with
not
much
spruce
a
nice
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
an
easy
drinker
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
taste
not
something
i
could
have
many
of
but
still
a
nice
beer
overall
a
good
beer
not
overpowering
mostly
focuses
on
the
spruce
but
a
good
flavor
3
25
00
and
im
incapable
of
finishing
this
beer
overall
recently
picked
this
up
in
a
variety
pack
and
easily
the
weakest
one
of
the
group
i
dont
hate
it
but
its
easily
specially
acquired
taste
have
one
on
me
salud
not
as
complex
as
i
though
it
would
have
been
a
little
out
of
balance
but
since
the
spruce
is
not
that
agressive
the
dryness
actually
helps
in
the
area
sadly
it
leaves
the
beer
a
in
a
lackluster
state
a
good
stepping
stone
for
anyone
that
has
not
had
a
spruced
beer
before
and
perhaps
even
an
extreme
beer
ok
took
it
to
my
qualified
beer
taster
and
she
said
toilet
bowl
cleaner
now
friends
im
not
agreeing
with
that
but
it
shows
lack
of
great
taste
really
this
is
not
what
i
would
crave
to
quaff
after
work
or
before
or
during
work
unless
it
was
really
bad
work
but
hey
thats
a
4
letter
word
and
ill
conclude
by
saying
flavorful
but
not
in
the
combination
i
think
accurate
for
the
label
esb
extra
special
bitter
or
for
anything
fully
satisfying
in
a
beer
i
feel
bad
to
say
this
as
i
dont
regularly
rate
beers
in
this
category
but
knowing
this
category
this
is
off
and
not
especially
tasty
the
taste
has
a
very
light
citrus
hop
flavor
with
a
malt
backbone
coming
in
on
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
a
little
after
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
overall
it
is
a
niceeasy
drinking
beer
oi
like
this
def
good
will
look
for
this
in
the
spring
i
think
it
will
be
nicer
in
the
spring
or
summer
o
its
pretty
clean
and
easy
to
drink
except
for
the
high
carbonation
but
doesnt
really
drink
like
an
esb
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
narrow
pint
glass
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
shrunk
to
half
its
size
and
then
stuck
around
for
a
bit
leaving
some
sticky
lacing
smells
hoppy
and
sour
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
up
front
with
a
nice
pinch
finish
of
hops
upon
exhaling
through
my
nose
after
my
first
sip
a
faint
essence
of
spruce
or
pine
is
noticed
not
outstanding
but
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
color
was
great
at
the
first
pour
but
as
it
sat
it
became
almost
mudded
in
appearance
the
smell
was
good
but
uneventful
no
indication
of
the
flavor
to
come
or
was
it
smooth
feel
on
the
tounge
and
has
an
almost
cleansing
feel
and
a
tast
was
taste
leaving
you
wanting
anouther
sip
but
alas
the
flavor
was
not
what
i
wanted
it
to
be
i
see
a
beer
with
a
spruce
mention
in
the
flavor
and
i
do
get
a
hint
but
not
the
kick
that
i
was
wanting
neh
needing
over
all
it
makes
me
want
anouther
beer
but
this
one
will
not
quench
the
thirst
overall
without
the
spruce
standing
alone
as
an
esb
it
doesnt
fare
too
well
really
add
the
spruce
gimmick
its
not
much
better
lackluster
offering
ok
nothing
special
overall
the
beer
fits
the
esb
character
it
is
a
good
enjoyable
brew
this
wooly
esb
from
magic
hat
is
a
milder
take
on
the
esb
style
the
look
of
this
beer
is
golden
with
a
slight
haze
the
smell
is
earthy
with
a
little
bit
of
piney
citrus
wooly
is
hoppy
with
a
bitter
kick
at
the
end
i
do
however
feel
like
it
is
milder
than
others
esbs
that
i
have
had
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
it
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
some
others
so
i
guess
it
all
depends
on
if
you
want
a
really
hearty
esb
or
if
you
want
something
that
you
can
drink
and
enjoy
while
you
watch
the
game
or
just
fataround
i
like
this
one
ok
over
all
o
the
thought
was
there
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
its
just
a
collection
of
strange
flavors
o
nothing
wrong
with
this
at
all
theres
no
wow
factor
or
zing
but
i
cant
find
anything
bad
with
this
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
but
id
never
refuse
one
o
way
too
much
spruce
to
be
enjoyable
it
wouldnt
be
half
bad
if
the
spruce
was
just
a
compliment
to
the
base
but
it
really
overpowers
the
beer
i
respect
what
mh
was
going
for
here
but
again
just
way
too
much
spruce
thanks
acurtis
for
the
opportunity
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
unique
in
the
aroma
and
taste
the
spruce
is
nice
and
sweet
where
i
thought
it
would
be
a
little
over
the
top
or
to
uncharacteristic
of
a
beer
quite
simply
the
best
esb
i
have
ever
drank
o
a
solid
beer
but
seems
to
be
something
this
is
an
interesting
brew
but
not
something
that
id
find
myself
craving
again
really
could
use
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
round
things
out

overall
interesting
onedimensional
spruce
beer
overall
clean
and
crisp
smooth
slightly
malty
but
not
too
sweet
easy
to
drink
overall
an
easy
drinking
clean
ale
ill
have
to
taste
the
alaskan
winter
beer
again
which
is
flavored
with
spruce
that
i
remember
more
fondly
than
this
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
clear
honey
amber
with
a
frothy
beige
head
that
lingers
long
low
aroma
of
corn
flavors
of
honey
malt
subtle
floral
hops
sharp
bitterness
metallic
notes
evenly
balanced
piney
spruce
notes
somewhat
subtle
but
noticeable
and
a
bit
reminiscent
of
cleaning
solution
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
somewhat
thin
average
beer
forget
what
everyone
says
this
is
absolutely
delicious
it
is
an
elglish
style
bitter
a
mild
one
at
that
but
that
is
the
base
upon
which
a
generous
spruce
addition
is
infused
resulting
in
a
full
bodied
seasonally
perfect
refreshingly
yummy
winter
ale
the
nose
is
really
piney
both
oily
and
sappy
which
could
also
be
aided
by
the
strong
hop
presence
for
the
style
rich
but
not
sweet
malts
bordering
on
amber
in
color
and
taste
temper
the
intensity
of
the
spruce
but
they
work
well
in
tandem
finish
is
crisp
and
akin
to
a
christmas
tree
my
brother
said
its
like
drinking
a
hippie
but
i
didnt
think
so
who
am
i
to
say
the
low
alcohol
and
fuler
body
make
this
a
nice
winter
session
beer
and
the
carbonation
is
upbeat
too
which
helps
the
cause
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
the
winter
seasonals
that
came
before
it
i
think
it
shows
a
nice
inventive
side
on
the
heels
of
the
dandelion
summer
brew
top
quality
i
thought
overall
a
curiosity
my
favorite
spruce
beer
was
made
by
the
late
siletz
brewing
co
in
oregon
with
fresh
spruce
tips
while
not
the
best
esb
out
there
its
certainly
different
and
drinkable
light
and
almost
bubbly
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
the
flavor
while
good
does
not
assert
itself
enough
nice
addition
to
the
magic
hat
winter
variety
pack
with
room
for
improvement
though
overall
a
very
unimpressive
beer
a
really
subpar
esb
any
day
plus
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
really
deliver
on
the
promised
spruce
flavors
and
aromas
skip
this
one
this
beer
has
a
almost
burnt
dark
malt
taste
that
is
just
a
bit
over
the
top
for
me
and
as
it
sits
it
seems
to
become
more
prominent
and
to
me
less
desirable
not
very
esblike
but
good
wooly
has
a
great
pour
a
crystalclear
redorange
with
a
sizable
head
the
aroma
is
good
but
seems
a
bit
two
faced
ill
stick
my
nose
to
the
glass
and
get
beautiful
caramel
malts
with
a
big
spruce
hit
then
ill
go
back
for
another
whiff
and
get
sweet
grains
and
wheat
it
might
be
the
spruce
messing
with
me
because
the
spruce
comes
on
strong
right
away
the
spruce
is
backed
up
by
some
caramel
and
pale
malts
and
rounded
out
by
some
herbal
hops
a
little
odd
just
like
pistil
was
but
still
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
wooly
is
another
unique
odd
and
still
drinkable
beer
from
magic
hat
can
a
brother
get
some
sam
the
sham
up
in
here
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
puffed
rice
funky
wheat
and
old
greens
the
hell
theres
spruce
in
this
this
isnt
a
year
old
hmm
the
taste
brings
the
spruce
into
reality
though
unfortunately
by
drowning
it
in
drytasting
caramel
bespackled
with
old
leaves
dammit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
bone
dry
finish
overall
this
was
just
odd
and
sad
theres
pretty
much
no
esb
character
and
whatever
else
is
there
doesnt
come
through
as
wellmelded
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
excellent
retention
and
cling
medium
to
high
in
carbonation
smell
is
similar
to
9
slightly
fruity
a
little
malty
and
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
very
similar
to
9
without
the
over
the
top
fruit
flavor
in
wooly
the
fruit
is
more
subtle
there
is
a
spiciness
and
citrus
character
to
the
hops
that
balance
well
with
the
big
malty
character
of
this
beer
overall
very
nicely
done
beer
i
will
be
having
more
probably
i
would
call
this
9s
older
more
manly
less
fruity
brother
overall
a
good
esb
but
im
not
sure
the
spruce
makes
it
better
than
it
would
be
without
