aroma
is
of
nuts
caramel
toast
and
mild
smoke
its
the
only
good
point
to
this
beer
pours
deep
gold
with
no
head
or
lacing
flavor
has
a
faint
caramel
note
in
the
background
the
rest
is
old
used
coffee
grounds
to
the
point
of
being
overwhelming
a
totally
different
coffee
flavor
than
can
be
found
in
stouts
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
coffee
ground
finish
supposedly
its
a
california
common
style
beer
its
nowhere
close
to
the
prototype
anchor
steam
not
recommended
12oz
bottle
is
brownishred
with
a
thin
beige
head
aromas
are
mainly
coffee
with
some
grain
but
not
much
else
tastes
include
coffee
toasty
grain
earthy
spicy
mouth
is
creamy
somewhat
acidic
with
a
semidry
finish
overall
i
think
this
exceptionally
created
but
pretty
onenote
with
not
a
lot
of
complexity
great
use
of
the
coffee
but
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
furthermore
oscura
45
overall
well
i
dont
know
quite
what
to
make
of
it
the
fact
that
its
a
lowabv
experimentalsomethingsomething
available
in
a
reasonably
priced
sixer
is
probably
whats
throwing
me
off
but
its
unique
and
id
definitely
seek
it
out
its
definitely
got
a
unique
greenroastvegetal
something
going
on
that
i
usually
associate
with
roastedtwodaysago
organic
coffee
id
definitely
like
to
know
more
about
the
process
and
whatever
the
heck
they
put
into
this
stuff
recommended
chris
lemke
of
wisconsinbrewreview
com
o
this
was
not
what
i
expected
when
i
cracked
it
open
but
not
a
bad
thing
very
sessionable
as
a
cali
common
should
be
but
the
coffee
adds
an
interesting
complexity
that
puts
it
into
a
whole
different
category
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
then
two
in
a
sitting
this
is
like
a
lagered
cup
of
fantastic
coffee
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
would
have
guessed
this
was
a
brown
ale
or
dopplebock
reminded
me
some
of
perkulator
but
the
coffee
works
well
with
the
steam
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
beautiful
coffee
brown
with
a
thin
slightly
tan
bubbly
head
smells
somewhat
earthy
and
sweet
with
a
bitterness
to
it
very
much
like
coffee
somewhat
of
a
cocoa
like
sweetness
to
it
that
goes
along
well
with
the
coffee
nose
despite
how
clean
the
beer
looks
and
the
lighter
brown
color
it
is
very
solid
in
color
with
very
little
light
penetration
the
taste
is
amazing
very
much
like
cold
iced
coffee
the
graininess
from
the
maize
is
somewhat
noticeable
under
the
initial
coffee
sweetness
and
bitterness
has
a
slight
creamy
taste
to
it
as
if
it
where
ice
coffee
with
a
bit
of
cream
not
sugar
however
more
bitter
and
strong
tasting
in
the
finish
has
a
nice
full
and
tart
mouth
feel
just
like
regular
coffee
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
few
beers
i
ever
new
i
would
definitely
buy
again
right
after
trying
it
cannot
wait
to
sip
a
nice
cold
one
of
these
later
on
this
summer
when
it
starts
to
get
nice
and
hot
outside
a
must
try
if
youre
both
a
coffee
and
craft
beer
lover
although
i
can
definitely
see
this
might
not
bee
for
everyone
pours
out
like
ice
tea
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
thin
off
white
head
quickly
rises
and
settles
like
on
a
cola
no
lacing
is
noticed
and
retention
is
very
poor
smell
is
coffee
mainly
but
there
are
also
earthy
tones
and
malts
its
weird
tasting
coffee
in
something
that
isnt
pitch
black
but
it
works
has
a
good
malt
body
to
cary
thru
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
not
only
for
coffee
but
also
for
a
california
common
its
nice
to
try
coffee
in
something
thats
not
a
stout
but
i
still
wish
it
had
a
fuller
body
pours
a
light
see
through
brown
color
with
a
small
slightly
off
white
head
which
recedes
to
nothing
and
leaves
very
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
bitter
coffee
it
is
not
very
big
though
the
taste
is
of
bitter
coffee
with
a
slight
sweetness
at
the
very
end
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
but
slightly
thin
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
cheers
di
thought
the
coffee
would
overwhelm
this
beer
but
this
is
actually
a
pretty
well
balanced
beer
id
like
to
have
this
one
again
pours
a
deep
amber
to
light
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dry
and
roasty
coffee
in
the
taste
dry
roasted
coffee
a
lighter
malt
and
a
small
note
of
sweetness
in
the
end
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
to
sweet
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
coffee
presence
and
a
thinner
body
decent
but
did
not
think
it
was
a
steam
beer
at
all
light
tan
colour
with
an
eighth
inch
of
head
distinct
coffee
aroma
a
little
lace
average
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
with
good
bitterness
and
secondary
malting
coffee
very
distinct
gets
bitterer
towards
the
end
but
tolerable
fast
dissipitating
head
poured
from
the
bottle
decant
amount
of
head
head
is
flimsy
and
disappears
quickly
dark
in
color
strong
full
coffee
flavor
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
rich
coffee
scents
that
teased
my
taste
buds
i
was
surprised
at
home
full
the
flavor
was
d
happy
to
have
experienced
what
a
coffee
infused
lager
is
like
and
a
steam
beer
at
that
relatively
drinkable
but
only
if
you
enjoy
coffee
pours
caramel
with
ruby
hue
fair
amount
of
head
at
first
which
dies
down
to
leave
enough
to
just
barely
cover
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
of
a
regular
red
ale
with
notes
of
roasted
coffee
on
the
finish
very
roasty
this
beers
flavor
profile
allows
the
coffee
they
used
to
shine
through
it
is
very
refreshing
and
is
almost
reminiscent
of
an
iced
coffee
with
a
light
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
quite
quaffable
while
this
beer
isnt
extreme
it
is
definitely
tasty
and
something
you
could
drink
all
evening
o
goes
down
very
easy
very
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
a
damn
fine
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
but
is
definitely
doesnt
fit
its
style
id
recommend
it
in
a
heartbeat
though
this
beer
is
strange
and
i
recommend
trying
it
to
anyone
that
loves
coffee
its
got
some
flaws
but
overall
a
good
beer
im
pretty
surprised
that
this
is
called
a
steam
beer
maybe
it
is
a
steam
beer
with
coffee
added
and
i
guess
that
would
make
sense
whatever
this
is
if
youre
looking
for
a
relatively
lowalcohol
coffee
beer
oscura
is
probably
a
good
choice
all
the
coffee
flavors
none
of
the
acrid
harshness
the
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
with
a
hearty
dose
of
bitter
coffee
light
spices
and
toasted
nuttiness
from
the
malt
carbonation
is
vigorous
to
the
point
of
diluting
the
body
midsip
while
the
back
of
the
tongue
is
washed
with
herbal
hop
bitterness
more
coffee
and
nutty
caramel
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
with
a
clean
finish
all
in
all
a
tasty
take
on
the
cali
common
style
something
worthy
of
a
homebrew
recreation
o
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
a
well
put
together
steam
beer
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
character
thanks
to
schmittymack
for
bringing
this
bottle
to
share
last
saturday
reading
the
label
i
assumed
this
was
a
stout
although
the
bottle
said
nothing
along
those
lines
the
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
lingering
tan
head
aromas
of
coffee
toasted
malt
and
light
vanilla
palate
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
coffee
toasted
malt
light
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
earthiness
overall
an
interesting
ale
worth
a
try
not
sure
about
this
one
very
odd
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
to
quick
overall
get
this
beer
its
different
from
what
you
would
expect
if
you
like
coffee
bender
this
stuff
is
better
in
every
way
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
certainly
would
order
it
again
but
if
you
dont
like
coffee
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
i
would
recommend
oscura
as
a
beer
to
accompany
a
dessert
smells
like
a
steam
bock
tastes
wow
peppery
and
coffee
tons
of
flavour
on
the
tongue
very
different
then
it
looks
well
carbonated
and
fairly
drinkable
but
a
bit
overly
spicy
dfairly
drinkable
but
not
the
best
im
going
to
have
to
rereview
this
beer
once
im
able
to
get
my
hands
on
some
fresher
stock
the
downside
is
that
the
bottling
date
is
on
the
bottom
of
the
brown
bottle
printed
in
black
lettering
which
means
its
impossible
to
see
when
the
bottle
is
still
full
i
remember
the
beer
being
much
more
enjoyable
than
im
tasting
tonight
even
from
a
couple
months
ago
if
youd
like
an
easy
to
drink
very
coffee
forward
beer
this
is
for
you
drinkability
high
iced
coffee
refreshing
perfect
for
lunch
it
goes
down
easy
do
its
hard
for
me
to
think
of
this
as
a
california
common
beer
as
it
tastes
nothing
like
the
most
well
known
of
the
style
anchor
steam
but
then
again
steam
only
refers
to
how
its
made
not
what
it
takes
like
having
said
all
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
easy
drinking
and
while
coffee
notes
were
apparent
from
the
getgo
they
were
not
overpowering
hats
off
to
furthermore
actually
reminds
me
a
bit
of
dark
horse
perkulator
insteresting
a
bit
different
but
a
large
amount
of
flavor
with
lower
abv
it
is
good
if
you
like
coffee
which
i
do
an
good
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
coffee
color
almost
like
iced
black
tea
with
a
thinnish
brownish
white
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
nothing
else
tastes
of
a
lot
of
freshly
ground
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
low
good
drinkability
an
interesting
twist
to
the
california
common
style
nice
job
furthermore
d
well
damn
i
got
an
old
beer
still
for
1
75
it
drinks
pretty
good
but
i
will
have
to
track
down
a
fresh
one
for
comparison
decent
coffee
beer
d
goes
down
easy
im
not
so
familiar
with
this
category
but
i
like
this
beer
brown
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
looks
like
a
soda
aroma
is
coffee
taste
also
is
coffee
and
caramel
malts
strong
coffee
taste
prevents
this
from
being
a
beer
with
good
drinkabilty
overall
ok
but
the
coffee
is
a
little
overpowering
i
would
recommend
to
try
once
super
easy
to
drink
really
solid
beverage
and
would
probably
be
amazing
with
some
chicken
tacos
it
has
that
clean
finish
bright
beginning
of
flavors
and
sharp
nose
altogether
im
a
fan
d
not
bad
but
many
other
brews
would
come
first
overall
i
really
like
this
unique
take
on
the
style
it
is
the
only
coffee
fueled
steam
beer
ive
ever
had
i
loved
the
combo
of
the
traditional
steam
beer
malt
bill
with
the
coffee
it
created
a
fascinating
profile
and
one
i
wish
i
could
get
regularly
in
boston
was
not
expecting
a
whole
lot
from
this
little
number
but
ive
got
to
say
im
really
impressed
great
taste
great
feel
i
dont
foresee
getting
too
messed
up
from
a
few
of
these
definitely
a
winner
drinkability
is
sessionable
id
like
grab
their
sampler
case
i
really
really
liked
the
knot
stock
as
well
interesting
brews
aran
madden
used
to
brew
here
in
the
burgh
with
the
foundry
and
church
brew
works
im
glad
he
found
a
happy
new
home
to
brew
at
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
overall
it
was
pretty
decent
the
coffee
addition
in
this
brew
is
really
strange
for
the
style
but
it
worked
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
you
like
coffee
the
coffee
flavors
did
seem
to
dominate
the
beer
a
bit
but
it
was
a
pretty
good
coffee
flavor
at
least
pretty
nice
beer
overall
cheers
i
have
to
say
that
while
im
not
overly
familiar
with
this
style
i
was
quite
surprised
to
see
oscura
classified
as
a
california
commonsteam
beer
that
being
said
pours
a
semitranslucent
reddishbrown
with
a
loose
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
swirl
of
foam
and
a
thin
band
around
the
edges
of
the
bowl
nose
is
somewhat
vegetal
and
also
suggests
spent
coffee
grounds
taste
expresses
coffee
grounds
some
malty
sweetness
caramel
or
toffee
followed
by
a
vegetal
quality
towards
the
back
and
a
light
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
lively
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
im
really
unclear
as
to
what
it
is
trying
to
be
at
first
impression
im
thinking
american
brown
but
not
getting
a
clear
style
impression
regardless
an
interesting
beer
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
if
the
opportunity
presents
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
this
is
a
smooth
highly
drinkable
beer
want
more
only
bought
a
single
12oz
bottle
good
drinkability
good
beer
drinkability
definately
the
best
ive
had
from
furthermore
brewing
a
nice
session
brown
even
if
it
is
stylisticly
a
steam
beer
i
could
easily
put
back
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
coffee
is
not
overwhelming
but
a
nice
complement
to
the
overall
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
i
would
say
this
is
definitely
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
furthermore
d
an
interesting
variation
on
the
style
with
the
fair
trade
coffee
addition
into
the
mix
it
is
rich
but
is
also
crisp
and
malty
with
the
even
balance
without
the
coffee
overpowering
everything
unique
stuff
d
for
the
rich
taste
it
is
really
solid
not
a
high
abv
makes
this
a
nice
go
to
pours
a
brownish
dulled
copper
color
with
small
cap
of
offwhite
head
leaving
little
lacing
scent
is
of
fresh
medium
roasted
coffee
beans
and
only
a
faint
touch
of
grassy
hops
and
carmely
malts
taste
is
once
again
a
cool
crisp
burst
of
the
fresh
medium
roasted
coffee
very
odd
having
this
flavor
unclouded
by
dark
roasted
malts
or
chocolate
flavors
very
icedcoffeeish
pale
carmel
malts
are
present
and
are
very
light
grassy
hop
touch
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
a
unique
beer
the
coffee
scent
and
taste
alone
makes
this
only
some
faint
muddled
earthy
charachteristics
cloudy
it
d
i
love
that
coffee
is
spreading
to
more
and
more
styles
i
never
expected
to
try
something
like
this
but
it
works
very
well
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
excellent
dry
roasted
coffee
scent
its
earthy
with
little
malt
character
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
with
the
addition
of
coffee
its
dry
and
roasted
without
the
black
and
chocolate
malt
taste
what
a
concept
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
smooth
coffee
beer
i
love
the
use
of
coffee
without
all
the
black
malts
another
interesting
brew
from
furthermore
who
would
have
thought
of
coffee
in
a
cali
commonsteam
beer
glad
that
these
folks
did
a
solid
choice
for
a
coffee
brew
outside
of
the
usual
porter
or
stout
style
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
very
nice
touch
of
coffee
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
some
coffee
notes
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
different
representation
of
style
this
is
one
is
a
little
lighter
than
your
average
coffeeflavored
beer
and
is
a
good
one
to
drink
for
a
long
time
d
interestingly
light
for
a
coffee
beer
it
still
packs
the
real
coffee
flavor
punch
to
it
pretty
well
balanced
and
mediumbodied
giving
it
a
rather
easy
drinkability
quite
interesting
to
see
a
coffeeinfused
beer
that
isnt
already
maltheavy
porterstoutdoppelbock
etc
this
experiment
is
actually
reasonable
successful
nice
to
see
brewers
playing
around
with
lagers
overall
one
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
tasted
certainly
not
my
favorite
but
a
worthy
well
crafted
brew
the
beer
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
full
flavored
with
a
nice
dry
finish
making
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
the
strange
metallic
flavor
in
the
finish
kind
of
lingers
and
makes
the
drinkability
suffer
d
quite
a
curious
brew
flavor
grew
on
me
after
a
few
sips
and
some
warming
commonsteam
beers
arent
in
the
normal
rotation
for
me
and
one
with
coffee
added
is
certainly
a
first
recommended
for
a
try
if
you
find
one
wouldnt
mind
having
another
thanks
again
adam
d
this
is
a
strange
beer
but
i
can
attest
to
drinking
it
chilled
on
a
summer
day
and
enjoying
it
drinking
it
is
pretty
effortless
but
maybe
i
am
too
much
of
a
coffee
lover
oscura
has
a
dark
copper
look
and
a
loose
off
white
cap
that
faded
into
the
darkness
looks
like
a
simple
beer
and
not
as
dark
as
i
was
expecting
for
being
brewed
with
some
fair
trade
coffee
the
smell
consists
of
some
sweet
malt
with
a
light
coffee
backing
and
grain
the
taste
is
the
same
exactly
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
coffee
in
here
but
its
rather
quite
subdued
for
being
a
steam
beer
i
think
the
coffee
is
at
the
right
spot
as
any
more
would
have
been
to
much
a
simple
style
with
a
simple
amount
of
coffee
light
to
medium
bodied
with
carb
hitting
the
tounge
this
one
is
not
dead
oscura
did
not
wow
me
so
i
wont
be
going
back
for
it
well
maybe
if
its
on
tap
i
will
thanks
jer
karen
this
beer
smells
exactly
like
my
morning
coffee
brewed
with
fair
trade
coffee
so
i
think
this
qualifies
as
me
being
a
good
person
didnt
expect
it
to
be
a
light
brownish
amber
after
smelling
it
the
head
was
the
faintest
brown
and
faded
quick
aroma
was
outstanding
and
full
of
coffee
and
dry
cocoa
very
malty
smell
and
a
slight
sweetness
taste
fell
short
for
me
the
lager
taste
shows
up
out
of
nowhere
a
bit
surprising
and
offputting
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
a
tasty
brew
just
unexpected
mouthfeel
is
standard
lager
thin
and
crisp
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
could
sit
around
and
watch
football
with
some
of
this
d
an
interesting
beer
that
would
need
to
be
chosen
during
cold
months
of
the
year
without
a
doubt
i
cant
imagine
having
a
coffee
type
brew
in
the
summer
but
during
the
winter
it
is
solid
i
would
however
avoid
having
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
regardless
of
the
year
pours
out
a
very
nice
clear
red
color
its
somewhere
between
copper
and
a
dark
amber
nice
looking
a
little
1
5cm
head
forms
on
top
but
the
bubbles
are
so
loose
that
it
sort
of
fades
quickly
still
looks
pretty
nice
but
the
head
is
a
little
boring
the
smell
is
interesting
very
clean
and
crisp
but
a
very
nice
caramelly
sweetness
i
like
the
smell
but
there
isnt
exactly
enough
in
there
the
one
other
thing
that
i
can
find
is
a
bit
of
toastiness
which
seems
odd
considering
the
color
i
wouldnt
expect
to
find
this
much
burnt
toasty
smell
in
there
the
taste
is
where
it
gets
interesting
i
think
you
get
a
very
nice
grainy
sweetness
that
is
filled
up
and
balanced
with
the
roastiness
its
really
nice
you
also
get
a
nice
slight
herbal
bitterness
balanced
with
sweetness
the
yeast
prfile
is
very
clean
which
brings
out
the
roasted
flavors
part
of
this
flavor
almost
seems
to
skip
over
that
moderate
nutty
slightly
toasty
malt
flavor
id
expect
for
the
color
i
find
this
really
enjoyable
and
tasty
the
body
is
a
little
thin
the
carbonation
rushes
in
but
isnt
too
exiting
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
enjoyable
not
too
heavy
or
overdone
but
the
roastiness
is
still
quite
interesting
overall
this
one
was
not
what
i
expected
but
it
was
worth
the
try
certainly
an
interesting
brew
and
the
brewer
should
be
complemented
for
the
creativity
just
kind
of
missed
the
mark
with
me
a
little
d
i
felt
like
this
should
be
a
stout
im
definitely
not
used
to
a
lighter
coffee
beer
while
it
lacked
a
bit
of
body
oscura
definitely
makes
up
for
it
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
departments
d
a
nice
coffee
beer
california
common
i
think
not
if
u
are
in
the
mood
for
a
coffee
forward
beer
this
is
a
goood
choice
it
went
down
easy
enough
but
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
drinkabilitythis
was
a
pretty
interesting
brew
not
really
in
a
good
or
bad
way
id
have
another
if
offered
just
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
this
is
a
fine
cali
common
i
once
brewed
a
steam
beer
based
on
an
anchor
clone
recipe
w
cold
brewed
panamanian
coffee
but
this
is
more
seemless
in
flavor
which
is
good
the
base
beer
isnt
overwhelmend
by
the
beanswell
done
this
one
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
and
some
good
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
roasted
coffee
but
not
overpowering
i
smell
malt
and
some
hops
some
toffee
its
good
the
taste
is
roasted
coffee
first
then
some
sweet
malts
and
toffee
with
some
hops
imo
this
is
a
coffee
lager
and
a
good
one
to
start
with
if
you
want
to
sample
coffee
brews
of
all
styles
i
like
this
one
its
smooth
and
drinkable
again
a
good
place
to
start
ill
buy
it
again
and
ill
recommended
it
for
1st
time
coffee
infused
samplers
and
others
who
just
like
coffee
brews
this
one
one
is
definably
lighter
then
the
stouts
and
ports
in
the
coffee
style
big
thanks
to
beerisheaven
for
this
one
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
around
1
75
glad
to
see
this
brewery
entering
the
pa
market
upon
pouring
into
my
shaker
glass
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
that
this
was
not
another
coffee
infused
porterstout
appears
the
color
of
iced
tea
with
about
two
fingers
of
quickly
fading
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
dominated
by
notes
of
medium
roasted
coffee
and
rich
toasted
cereal
grains
followed
by
earthy
hops
slightly
spicy
hints
of
citrus
a
pleasing
bitterness
to
compliment
the
sweetness
of
the
caramelized
malt
crisp
bitter
and
approaching
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
a
great
addition
to
the
pa
beer
scene
d
very
quaffable
under
6
i
love
coffee
beer
and
coffee
in
beer
a
solid
ale
the
best
ive
had
from
furthermore
i
am
sure
having
this
fresh
on
tap
help
a
loti
would
bet
the
bottled
version
is
not
as
good
i
will
have
to
try
that
experiment
as
i
know
this
beer
is
available
in
pa
now
for
coffee
beer
lovers
or
is
that
beer
coffee
lovers
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
this
is
on
the
top
of
the
list
for
coffee
infused
beers
very
nice
head
bout
an
inch
thick
that
never
went
flat
nice
rich
hops
light
the
coffee
in
this
beer
is
just
overall
delicious
not
acidic
like
alot
of
coffee
beers
taste
like
it
didnt
last
long
it
was
too
easy
to
drink
and
went
down
nice
and
smooth
ill
easily
be
picking
this
one
up
again
this
was
definitely
a
weird
one
i
honestly
liked
all
of
the
individual
components
of
this
beer
well
done
coffee
character
good
backing
flavors
a
crisp
smooth
and
easydrinking
body
the
problem
is
i
dont
like
my
coffee
beers
feeling
like
a
lager
and
i
dont
like
my
lagers
having
coffee
in
them
thus
the
drinkibility
takes
a
hit
i
drank
this
with
my
meal
and
it
just
didnt
work
at
all
for
me
probably
should
have
saved
it
for
a
nightcap
otherwise
this
is
definitley
one
to
check
out
if
your
a
coffeehead
this
is
a
fantastic
coffee
beer
overall
i
just
cant
seem
to
like
this
beer
i
like
coffee
beers
but
this
beer
is
just
simply
coffee
and
no
beer
i
really
dont
know
much
about
this
beer
but
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
it
again
anytime
soon
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
mellow
and
easydrinking
coffee
beer
with
just
enough
richness
and
character
to
sustain
itself
yet
still
refreshing
enough
to
hold
up
for
multiple
rounds
nicely
composed
and
uniquely
flavorful
cheers
the
appearancearoma
really
hurt
the
overall
rating
but
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
furthermore
has
yet
to
disappoint
pours
a
glowing
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
head
that
wants
to
camp
out
for
a
bit
ok
i
guess
it
wants
to
camp
out
forever
since
i
have
been
waiting
here
for
15
minutes
and
havent
noticed
a
change
guess
im
going
to
have
to
dive
in
smells
like
freshly
ground
coffee
beans
before
they
have
been
brewed
not
much
else
but
still
inviting
the
taste
is
fresh
roasted
coffee
of
a
cheap
variety
think
folgers
breakfast
blend
overall
it
isnt
too
bad
but
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
maybe
an
additional
element
since
the
coffee
flavor
here
is
not
of
a
gourmet
variety
drinkability
is
interesting
get
rid
of
the
vegetalold
coffee
ground
note
and
this
is
a
really
nice
wellaboveaverage
beer
as
is
there
are
some
really
good
aspects
of
it
and
the
one
really
noticeable
flaw
but
regardless
its
a
very
unique
beer
thats
pretty
tasty
as
is
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
bright
deep
copper
color
with
no
head
aroma
is
of
grain
and
roast
coffee
medium
bodied
this
beer
tastes
of
caramel
up
front
and
has
a
long
slow
roasted
coffee
finish
definitely
for
fans
of
iced
coffee
not
sure
id
want
a
second
one
right
away
but
would
definitely
drink
one
again
in
the
future
this
was
done
really
well
nice
twist
on
a
coffee
beer
that
isnt
a
stout
this
beer
smells
more
like
coffee
and
looks
less
like
coffee
than
any
coffee
beer
ive
ever
seen
i
guess
im
used
to
coffee
flavors
in
stouts
and
such
but
it
was
very
creative
and
quite
drinkable
i
must
sample
other
furthermore
brews
well
good
beer
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
big
points
for
originality
confounding
expectations
well
worth
giving
this
one
a
whirl
a
very
nice
surprise
and
treat
can
and
will
drink
lots
of
this
stuff
yum
d
i
had
no
expectations
of
this
beer
this
was
unique
to
anything
i
have
tried
before
and
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
it
altogether
but
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
it
out
the
coffeeroastsmoke
flavors
and
aroma
were
great
if
youre
a
coffee
lover
give
this
one
a
try
i
enjoy
complexity
in
beer
but
not
all
necessarily
require
a
diverse
flavor
profile
to
impress
me
this
is
a
coffee
beer
pure
and
simple
it
was
the
first
i
have
sampled
that
was
not
a
shade
of
brown
or
black
and
the
first
that
was
not
an
ale
according
to
the
label
this
is
a
alelager
hybrid
oscura
is
definitely
an
interesting
concoction
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
see
other
brewers
trying
their
hand
at
dirty
who
into
an
imperial
pint
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
starting
head
then
nothing
but
the
thinnest
of
films
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
full
of
aromatic
roasted
coffee
one
dimensional
but
still
nice
tastes
kind
of
like
a
beery
coffee
the
latter
being
quite
strong
but
some
standard
caramels
and
grains
and
a
bit
of
a
herbal
quality
to
it
has
decent
body
plenty
of
play
in
all
very
interesting
and
fun
to
drink
a
coffee
beer
without
the
mask
of
a
hearty
stout
to
hide
behind
in
typical
furthermore
fashion
this
is
a
rather
plain
base
beer
with
a
touch
of
uniqueness
to
it
this
pours
out
a
deep
rusty
copper
color
with
great
clarity
and
a
welllacing
head
the
aroma
is
an
inyourface
coffee
punch
but
done
so
delicately
it
is
tough
to
get
past
the
coffee
to
find
any
attributes
in
terms
of
aroma
so
if
you
are
not
a
coffee
fan
this
probably
wont
turn
you
on
at
first
whiff
the
interesting
as
it
blends
a
heavy
dose
of
iced
coffee
and
fruit
lagerness
the
finish
is
slighly
dry
and
i
am
left
with
sense
of
cocoa
for
such
a
light
beer
in
terms
of
body
there
are
heavy
flavors
and
depth
this
is
a
welldone
beer
and
very
different
from
other
coffeeinfused
beers
that
i
have
come
across
it
is
a
pretty
interesting
step
to
go
with
coffee
in
such
an
unroasted
beer
that
being
said
like
others
in
the
furthermore
lineup
this
would
be
a
great
dinner
beer
but
not
one
that
i
see
myself
reaching
for
often
d
a
bit
of
a
onenote
song
like
perkulator
if
you
like
coffee
this
is
a
fun
one
but
dont
expect
classic
balance
or
depth
just
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
a
coffeebomb
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
really
like
the
smooth
coffee
flavors
a
great
brew
i
will
gladly
seek
this
one
out
again
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
much
lighter
than
the
coffee
stouts
so
it
would
be
great
with
a
sunday
brunch
if
you
are
into
coffee
brew
this
one
is
a
must
try
by
the
way
is
oscura
a
particular
style
of
brew
ive
noticed
other
breweries
with
the
same
namestyle
interesting
i
thought
this
would
have
a
lot
more
coffee
flavor
to
it
but
was
still
pretty
good
much
lighter
in
body
than
other
coffee
beers
ive
had
worth
a
try
pours
murky
brown
oddest
color
on
a
coffee
beer
ive
seen
nose
is
a
lot
of
coffee
a
lot
vibrant
espresso
grinds
kinda
fragrance
flavor
carries
the
same
but
its
a
real
big
punch
in
the
mouth
and
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
so
intense
and
coffeeforward
intense
not
much
going
on
here
besides
coffee
feel
is
fine
so
is
drinkability
this
is
a
coffee
beer
plain
and
simple
d
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
like
coffee
just
somewhat
boring
and
one
dimensional
this
is
a
nice
ale
with
a
hint
of
coffee
flavor
nice
ontap
at
the
acadia
cafe
in
minneapolis
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
a
clear
amber
with
short
white
head
interestingly
i
had
this
shortly
after
sampling
peak
organics
espresso
amber
by
comparison
the
obscura
has
more
flavor
up
front
but
less
aftertaste
it
still
had
a
wonderful
medium
roast
aroma
and
burnt
chocolate
flavor
there
was
a
touch
of
bready
malt
in
the
background
but
the
coffee
dominated
the
flavor
unlike
some
coffee
beers
this
one
isnt
too
over
the
top
its
fairly
drinkable
and
you
can
tell
thats
beer
id
say
its
worth
a
try
to
for
coffee
lovers
drinkability
its
different
for
sure
while
coffee
stouts
are
downright
commonplace
these
days
im
hardpressed
to
name
even
one
other
coffee
lager
a
coffeebased
brew
for
warmer
days
definitely
worth
trying
a
bottle
bottom
line
a
tasty
brew
with
the
word
coffee
on
the
label
and
by
golly
the
coffee
tastes
very
nice
indeed
a
keeper
coffee
beer
and
not
bad
drinkability
this
ones
pretty
good
the
coffees
about
as
authentic
as
you
get
but
theres
not
too
much
backing
up
thats
noticeable
some
faint
malts
roasted
and
darker
and
then
some
but
nothing
that
really
comes
through
in
any
noticeable
way
this
ones
definitely
all
about
the
coffee
and
while
the
coffees
good
itd
be
nice
to
see
a
little
more
here
backing
it
up
the
unique
ideas
of
this
beer
really
come
together
nicely
the
softer
coffee
infused
with
this
vienna
lager
combine
for
a
delicious
beer
i
wont
hesitate
in
picking
this
beer
up
again
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
its
definitely
worth
it
from
a
brown
12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
light
root
beer
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
and
below
average
carbonation
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
there
is
a
slight
dusty
taste
too
first
sip
is
sweet
then
it
is
all
coffee
coffee
coffee
and
more
coffee
very
light
bodied
decent
mouthfeel
but
a
tad
under
carbonated
pretty
good
sorry
d
this
beer
is
coffee
stop
that
is
all
stop
there
is
no
depth
or
other
flavors
to
balance
it
and
the
coffee
flavor
was
mostly
coffee
grounds
not
coffee
bean
of
fresh
coffee
the
more
i
sipped
this
beer
the
more
the
drinkability
score
when
down
i
give
them
high
marks
for
creativity
but
there
just
isnt
enough
follow
through
d
very
drinkable
an
excellent
coffee
lager
not
a
stout
if
there
is
a
criticism
to
this
brew
it
is
that
its
onedimensional
coffee
if
you
enjoy
coffee
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
very
true
coffee
flavor
i
am
enjoying
the
experimentation
at
furthermore
d
this
is
simply
too
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
was
actually
a
little
surprised
all
in
all
seemed
like
a
watered
down
doppelbock
overall
pretty
tasty
though
clear
amber
thin
cream
colored
head
lacing
is
pretty
sporadic
smells
like
coffee
like
used
coffee
gounds
pretty
thick
not
much
else
to
the
aroma
decent
tasting
coffee
beer
but
i
much
prefer
the
stoutporter
based
coffee
beers
this
tastes
more
like
just
coffee
than
a
blend
of
coffeebeer
i
just
get
a
lot
of
bitter
coffee
ground
flavor
which
is
o
k
but
i
like
a
little
bit
more
beer
character
in
my
coffee
beers
decent
enough
but
lets
just
say
im
glad
i
only
got
a
single
of
this
one
this
was
a
plesant
suprise
this
was
the
lightest
color
coffiee
beer
that
i
have
run
acros
so
i
dident
have
much
hope
for
this
one
to
my
suprise
the
coffiee
flavor
is
exceptional
in
this
one
and
is
in
purfict
ballance
with
a
robust
amber
lager
i
couldent
put
this
one
down
it
was
bitter
slght
bits
of
carmal
and
sour
notes
and
had
me
beging
for
more
i
need
to
get
more
of
these
for
sure
nice
full
malty
flavor
medium
bodied
the
coffee
has
an
herbal
effect
here
offsetting
the
sweet
malt
a
drinkable
session
beer
the
aftertaste
is
a
weird
but
not
bad
combo
of
coffee
and
earthy
hops
the
only
minor
negative
is
that
the
light
sweetness
of
the
beer
doesnt
blend
as
well
with
the
coffee
as
much
as
a
smallerbodied
or
darker
beer
might
for
example
i
would
have
chose
a
brown
coffee
ale
rather
than
an
amber
pseudolager
steam
beercalifornia
commonstyle
appearance
is
good
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
and
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
similar
lots
of
coffee
flavored
malt
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
yeastiness
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
medium
body
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
also
good
overall
i
am
really
unsure
what
this
one
is
supposed
to
be
it
is
carbonated
the
buzz
i
am
feeling
is
a
testament
to
that
and
the
aroma
was
very
very
nice
but
the
flavor
just
left
me
hanging
it
needed
that
extra
push
to
really
come
forward
and
show
off
nver
the
less
it
was
still
very
solid
and
a
very
nice
little
beer
just
not
sure
what
it
actually
was
d
pretty
solid
drinker
this
is
really
quite
drinkable
definitely
an
aftertaste
of
coffee
d
very
well
constructed
beer
the
coffee
flavor
ends
up
canceling
out
any
of
the
subtlety
of
the
base
beer
so
thats
a
bit
of
a
bummer
quite
appealing
otherwise
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
but
though
im
not
sure
the
herbedspiced
beer
category
is
necessarily
what
the
oscura
folks
were
going
for
whatever
it
was
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
they
missed
it
a
bit
this
beer
captures
the
essence
of
coffee
like
no
other
including
big
stouts
a
coffee
lovers
beer
i
would
prefer
drinking
this
to
coffee
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bitter
coffee
grounds
with
hints
of
caramel
and
lots
of
piney
hops
the
taste
has
a
little
less
coffee
than
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
very
much
there
there
is
more
hops
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
oddest
beers
i
have
yet
tasted
and
i
like
it
it
would
be
perfect
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
coffee
beer
but
not
something
as
heavy
as
most
coffee
stouts
are
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
this
beer
must
be
drunken
warm
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
on
the
lighter
side
but
i
find
that
really
enjoyable
as
most
coffee
brews
tend
to
be
heavy
stouts
this
one
is
quite
refreshing
while
still
packing
a
big
coffee
punch
overall
a
solid
new
brew
from
furthermore
and
one
i
could
see
drinking
a
good
number
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
wish
i
had
easier
access
to
this
one
coffee
beer
lovers
find
this
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
toffee
caramel
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
the
coffee
flavor
comes
through
a
lot
stronger
in
the
flavor
though
not
overpowering
some
toasted
almonds
as
well
are
detected
finishes
short
and
coffee
bitter
medium
bodied
creamy
texture
the
overall
drinkablility
is
quite
nice
i
wish
i
had
some
more
of
this
beer
to
share
because
it
was
quite
interesting
well
done
thanks
to
asmokingoat
for
sending
me
this
bottle
poured
into
a
stone
irs
stem
because
i
was
envisioning
a
coffee
stout
needless
to
say
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
chestnut
brown
pour
with
a
nice
beige
head
aroma
of
rich
coffee
beans
taste
try
a
crisp
nicely
hopped
lager
with
tons
of
coffee
flavor
so
strange
that
i
kinda
like
this
could
i
drink
a
6
pack
of
this
probably
not
but
glad
i
grabbed
a
single
drinkability
high
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
furthermores
beers
for
some
reason
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
doesnt
matter
this
one
is
a
homerun
winner
in
my
book
unique
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
ill
be
buying
much
more
of
this
kudos
to
furthermore
for
this
wild
card
im
liking
them
more
and
more
with
each
new
release
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
bennos
beer
tent
at
the
wi
state
fair
finaly
a
local
beer
lots
of
luck
with
the
new
move
welcome
to
the
neighborhood
appereance
was
hazy
dark
copper
since
i
rolled
the
bottle
to
get
tht
lovely
lava
lamp
like
sediment
brownish
creamy
foam
settle
for
a
bit
then
kinda
went
way
left
some
lace
bubbles
behind
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
yeast
and
spice
undertones
some
lighty
possibly
toasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
supisingly
crisp
good
carbonation
taste
hits
hoppy
before
its
moves
to
spice
theres
a
slight
citrusyorange
arouma
as
it
opens
up
plays
well
with
the
hopps
overall
a
nice
calicommon
see
you
guys
in
industry
balance
this
beer
has
balance
and
not
just
balance
but
old
school
90sstyle
microbrewery
balance
where
the
malt
and
hops
come
flailing
out
with
an
abundance
of
flavor
yet
it
all
works
out
in
the
end
aside
from
the
head
dropping
out
quicker
than
we
wanted
it
to
small
peanuts
this
is
an
all
around
great
beer
i
apparently
think
more
of
this
beer
than
most
raters
but
i
think
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
hmmm
i
can
dig
this
its
better
than
their
power
tool
pilsner
and
better
than
most
macro
lagers
there
are
many
many
better
options
out
there
an
average
brew
from
skyscraper
a
new
brewery
for
me
i
think
ill
pass
on
any
other
offerings
drinkability
you
could
quaff
a
few
of
these
but
boredom
will
set
in
after
one
or
two
not
recommended
notes
this
was
much
better
than
the
honeyweizen
and
restored
faith
that
these
guys
can
brew
a
decent
beer
appearance
is
boring
and
sets
the
bar
pretty
low
both
offerings
ive
had
from
this
brewer
have
looked
like
cider
limp
and
its
not
a
bottling
issue
as
they
were
both
fresh
and
unharmed
in
any
way
d
newly
opened
brewery
here
in
la
so
i
had
high
hopes
shot
down
d
one
of
the
very
few
california
commons
that
i
have
ever
had
but
really
not
very
good
anchor
steam
is
a
much
better
choice
well
this
is
no
anchor
steam
it
is
unfortunate
that
any
brewery
trying
to
make
this
beer
style
in
california
must
be
compared
to
possibly
the
best
one
and
the
beer
that
restarted
good
beer
in
america
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
see
buying
when
anchor
steam
cost
11
a
six
pack
and
this
coasts
7
overall
i
hate
to
give
a
less
than
stellar
review
to
a
small
producer
but
i
dont
think
this
even
close
to
the
benchmark
anchor
steam
for
this
category
th
off
fruitiness
really
turned
me
off
i
hope
i
can
rereview
more
postively
in
the
future
some
pleasant
ester
and
hop
flavour
but
isnt
balanced
well
with
an
over
carbonated
under
bodied
beer
blood
navel
orange
taste
and
aroma
seems
over
ripe
with
excess
sulphur
although
could
lend
itself
to
a
few
if
the
sulphur
wasnt
so
evident
overall
im
normally
a
fan
of
mountain
goat
beers
but
have
to
admit
that
this
one
was
a
bit
disappointing
not
awful
by
any
means
just
a
bit
of
an
awkward
flavour
profile
i
certainly
wouldnt
recommend
it
at
au69
a
case
poured
this
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
very
fizzy
then
scummy
head
aroma
was
abundant
tropical
fruit
with
some
yeast
and
hop
flavors
a
bit
more
traditionally
steam
but
not
much
the
heavy
carbonic
tang
hinders
bodys
a
tad
thin
finish
is
like
flavor
not
very
balanced
too
long
lasting
never
want
another
very
minimally
similar
to
a
steam
beer
o
a
poor
imitation
of
the
original
anchor
steam
not
bad
but
not
worth
seeking
out
o
nice
beer
that
goes
down
quite
easy
good
for
a
few
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
but
nothing
special
imho
it
could
probably
do
with
either
a
tad
more
flavour
hops
or
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
the
astringency
o
good
for
warmer
weather
but
not
a
lot
to
this
at
all
certainly
a
nice
enouh
brew
perhaps
more
suited
to
really
hot
weather
od
a
fairly
tasty
light
beer
pretty
decent
i
remember
it
being
really
tasty
on
tap
at
the
brewery
but
less
so
from
the
bottle
which
is
probably
older
not
bad
as
a
gateway
craft
overall
interesting
a
great
hot
weather
beer
zestily
refreshing
so
when
will
mountain
goat
make
their
core
business
their
better
oneoff
beers
rather
than
the
two
they
regularly
release
o
a
little
bit
different
and
really
sessionable
overall
an
easy
light
drink
good
for
hot
weather
or
hot
food
enough
taste
and
nose
to
keep
it
all
interesting
othis
combination
of
sweetness
and
dry
bitter
is
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
but
it
works
the
subtle
sweetness
takes
this
beer
to
a
different
level
id
rather
drink
this
than
most
of
the
ipas
ive
had
very
well
done
one
of
the
most
consistent
beers
ive
tried
i
would
highly
recommend
this
for
summer
as
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
will
be
purchasing
lots
its
not
something
to
write
home
about
drinkable
on
a
hot
aussie
day
and
is
definitely
better
than
a
macro
aussie
lager
but
not
something
you
would
recommend
ok
summer
drinking
but
not
much
more
mild
flavours
of
tangy
citrus
fruits
and
some
dry
aniseed
smoke
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
very
subtle
in
all
respects
and
clearly
built
to
quaff
some
examples
from
tap
have
been
much
better
so
i
will
need
to
revisit
at
some
point
pours
straw
yellow
with
slight
cloudiness
from
bottle
conditioning
fresh
yeast
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
lemony
citrus
hops
in
the
background
crisp
soft
mouthfeel
bit
fruity
firm
but
light
bitterness
there
seems
to
be
a
subtle
roast
note
in
there
as
well
its
like
a
summer
steam
beer
this
is
a
very
very
well
crafted
beer
sometimes
i
absolutely
love
a
gentle
delicate
beer
like
this
food
match
thai
grilled
chicken
with
salad
or
light
barbeque
fare
d
my
first
steam
beer
so
hard
to
judge
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
well
im
impressed
wish
i
grabbed
more
than
one
bottle
but
i
will
cherish
this
one
easily
drinkable
and
well
made
a
bit
of
yawn
in
every
glass
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
quite
sure
who
would
get
into
this
not
enough
for
the
geeks
and
a
bit
out
there
for
the
regular
folks
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
on
the
nose
and
some
more
on
the
palate
but
very
high
carbonation
gives
it
a
prickly
feel
that
hides
some
of
the
flavour
somewhat
one
dimsional
and
drab
for
me
this
is
only
the
scond
steam
beer
ive
had
the
other
being
the
original
anchor
and
i
didnt
think
much
of
that
either
so
maybe
its
the
whole
steam
thing
i
dont
dig
everything
adds
up
to
make
this
one
sessionable
beer
with
one
sip
i
was
instantly
reminded
of
james
squire
golden
ale
a
beer
that
i
have
a
lot
of
time
for
currently
a
rather
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
and
the
best
from
mountain
goat
that
i
have
tried
d
drinkable
but
not
inspiring
wouldnt
rush
out
to
get
again
although
i
am
not
overly
familar
with
this
style
it
just
seems
lacking
in
something
this
beer
was
given
me
to
as
a
present
and
must
say
ive
never
tried
it
before
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
goesit
pours
a
dark
orange
cloudy
straw
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
creamy
head
across
the
top
with
a
nice
even
ring
of
lacing
around
the
rimit
has
aromas
of
subtle
spicey
oranges
and
a
big
hit
of
wheatit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
spicy
wheat
followed
up
a
very
nice
dry
crisp
finish
that
leaves
your
thirst
satisfied
but
still
wanting
another
sipalthough
this
beer
isnt
very
complex
and
is
pretty
much
straight
down
the
line
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
recommend
this
as
a
starter
into
the
micro
world
for
newbies
d
an
interesting
style
not
far
off
the
california
common
style
description
what
can
i
say
its
drinkable
there
is
flavour
it
isnt
stylistically
accurate
and
otherwise
it
is
a
bit
boring
a
decent
step
up
from
macro
lagers
and
an
easy
entry
for
new
craft
drinkers
seems
watery
to
me
but
as
already
mentioned
that
only
adds
to
its
quaffability
d
not
horrible
but
certainly
could
have
a
bit
more
oomph
i
guess
its
an
approachable
beer
from
a
decent
microbrewery
also
surely
steam
ale
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
tangy
and
fizzy
but
otherwise
ok
overall
its
not
too
bad
but
if
i
dont
ever
drink
this
again
i
think
ill
survive
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
tasting
beer
that
finishes
really
well
with
pretty
much
any
meal
especially
a
burger
o
a
good
beer
that
has
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
and
is
super
easy
drinking
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
cali
common
style
nice
bready
flavors
with
a
good
balancing
hop
presence
drinkability
is
okay
the
leafy
vegetable
qualities
of
the
hops
just
didnt
work
here
for
me
lacking
the
nuance
of
a
steam
beer
id
have
never
guessed
by
the
taste
md
a
bit
syrupy
but
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
it
coats
your
mouth
as
well
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
the
bomber
down
maybe
i
was
just
not
in
the
mood
copper
colored
brew
decent
sized
cream
colored
head
kind
of
surprisingly
the
hops
dominate
the
nose
bitter
variety
nice
sweet
malts
too
same
kind
of
thing
for
the
taste
hoppy
to
the
point
of
being
somewhat
surprising
ive
only
had
a
couple
to
a
handful
of
this
kind
of
style
so
im
not
sure
if
it
has
a
normal
profile
or
not
really
the
only
steam
that
i
am
really
familiar
with
is
of
course
anchors
and
this
seems
to
be
a
bigger
beer
than
that
most
malts
and
for
sure
more
hops
medium
bodied
somewhat
creamy
mouth
tastey
brew
ive
been
hearing
murmurs
about
this
flat
earth
and
will
for
sure
dive
deeper
into
their
line
havent
had
much
of
this
style
before
so
its
hard
to
compare
this
to
any
other
commons
o
a
solid
offering
from
flat
earth
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
pretty
underrated
drinkability
is
very
good
given
the
style
this
beer
falls
under
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
very
good
session
beer
in
my
opinion
d
very
good
drinkable
beer
tough
to
not
compare
this
beer
to
anchor
steam
as
the
notorious
option
in
the
style
good
everyday
type
of
beer
solid
core
of
malt
fresh
and
bitter
with
the
hops
sessionable
5
5
according
to
label
american
pale
victory
crystal
and
wheat
malts
cluster
mt
hood
and
northern
brewer
hops
an
odd
brew
mixed
feelings
though
i
like
more
than
dislike
as
a
whole
seems
overhopped
which
is
odd
in
itself
coming
from
me
or
just
hopped
in
a
different
direction
than
i
would
like
the
sourness
is
a
bit
much
ill
put
this
in
the
interesting
category
this
is
a
balanced
drinkable
beer
not
overly
complex
but
i
enjoyed
it
plenty
of
flavor
lot
of
fruitiness
from
the
ale
yeast
here
and
smooth
drinkibility
made
for
a
fine
quaff
maybe
a
bit
more
balancing
hop
action
would
have
been
welcome
but
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
steam
beer
from
flat
earth
it
was
real
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
finished
a
few
more
glasses
of
this
easy
i
did
like
the
style
so
i
will
try
a
few
more
but
this
one
was
a
quite
interesting
brew
golden
orange
in
color
with
sudsy
off
white
head
on
top
nice
bitter
hop
scent
fills
the
nose
taste
is
moderately
hoppy
a
nice
bite
to
go
along
with
the
malt
crisp
hops
with
a
bit
of
graininess
as
well
feel
is
fine
maybe
a
tad
thin
but
nothing
crazy
very
drinkable
this
is
one
is
in
the
top
two
for
me
as
far
as
offerings
from
flat
earth
several
of
their
other
beers
i
have
come
away
with
less
than
impressed
nothing
outrageous
here
just
a
solid
sessionable
hopped
up
beer
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
draft
variety
of
this
beer
it
seemed
to
present
itself
as
less
hoppy
than
its
bottled
counterpart
the
color
was
light
amber
with
a
light
white
head
sweet
and
malty
nose
sweet
attack
with
some
late
presenting
hops
that
acted
more
complementary
in
the
draft
than
as
the
centerpiece
in
the
bottle
there
are
some
fruit
notes
in
the
flavor
that
seem
almost
like
mild
berry
flavors
as
i
have
said
much
less
hoppy
than
what
i
remember
the
bottled
variety
being
drinkability
its
a
good
representation
of
the
american
steam
beer
style
i
could
see
having
more
of
this
one
if
i
run
across
it
again
thanks
for
reading
my
first
review
and
if
there
are
are
any
of
you
traveling
to
this
part
of
the
country
i
live
in
saint
paul
mn
near
summit
flat
earth
lift
bridge
and
a
couple
killer
beer
bars
happy
gnome
muddy
pig
great
waters
and
bulldog
lowertown
hit
me
up
bring
some
beer
and
well
definitely
raise
our
glasses
in
a
cheer
cloudy
yellow
with
some
sediment
in
the
glass
has
a
sweet
smell
with
lots
of
floral
hops
tastes
citrusy
reminiscent
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
with
a
very
clean
drinkable
mouthfeel
as
i
drink
it
i
notice
tremendous
head
retention
with
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
this
is
a
taste
is
sweet
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
to
balance
it
out
overall
very
solid
try
md
light
to
medium
boided
excellent
carbonation
easy
drinking
but
the
flavor
does
not
leave
me
wanting
more
a
good
beer
hardly
a
great
one
but
certainly
an
interesting
offering
with
an
equally
interesting
label
and
text
to
accompany
it
thanks
to
bdlbrewster
for
the
chance
to
try
it
this
is
actually
pretty
nice
at
first
i
didnt
like
how
jarring
the
transition
between
the
smooth
chewy
malt
notes
in
the
middle
and
the
harsher
hop
notes
in
the
finish
but
after
a
few
sips
it
begins
to
get
a
bit
more
integrated
and
balanced
though
the
hop
character
is
a
bit
more
harsh
than
i
might
prefer
this
definitely
seems
to
be
an
underappreciated
beer
though
but
i
suspect
that
the
breweries
consistency
issues
have
to
do
with
much
of
the
problem
i
am
just
glad
that
i
got
a
stable
fresh
bottle
d
great
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
they
would
make
sixers
d
drinkability
is
not
bad
the
earthy
characteristics
are
nice
and
refreshing
it
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
if
the
carbonation
issues
could
be
addressed
time
doesnt
seem
to
work
this
issue
out
pour
it
swirl
it
let
it
set
swirl
it
let
it
set
and
still
it
just
has
too
much
carbonation
to
truly
enjoy
the
experience
not
bad
overall
though
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
out
d
goes
down
pretty
good
no
carbonation
to
fill
you
up
and
no
single
taste
to
make
you
spit
it
out
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
copperish
wheat
colour
of
beer
gave
off
a
fair
amount
of
foam
then
reducing
to
wisps
of
beer
the
aroma
was
that
of
citrus
and
malts
the
taste
however
tasted
of
flat
citrus
with
slight
tones
of
malt
that
left
a
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
wont
have
this
beer
again
just
due
to
the
unbalanced
combination
that
it
gave
d
good
drinkable
brew
that
met
my
expectations
overall
this
isnt
my
typical
style
of
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
plan
on
buying
this
one
again
da
nice
brew
not
my
favorite
from
flat
earth
thus
far
but
still
very
ejoyable
would
consider
this
one
again
in
the
future
if
the
time
is
right
i
was
rather
expecting
an
overcarbonated
mess
after
the
first
pour
but
it
turned
out
to
be
alright
and
quite
enjoyable
a
nice
steam
beer
i
refuse
to
call
it
california
common
aroma
was
so
so
theres
a
spiciness
to
it
that
i
wasnt
expecting
pour
was
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
a
puffy
one
finger
near
tan
head
clear
and
crisp
taste
was
good
but
odd
there
is
a
strong
astringent
bitterness
to
it
that
i
dont
associate
with
steam
beer
the
hops
create
a
resinous
film
on
the
throat
that
dont
let
any
malt
through
not
bad
pours
a
handsome
copper
color
with
a
monstrous
almost
unruly
beige
head
that
really
hangs
in
there
for
a
long
time
and
leaves
clumpy
sticky
lacing
all
over
the
glass
nice
floral
hop
aroma
some
grainybeery
aromas
some
slight
citrustangerine
notes
really
nice
flavors
here
bright
citrusy
some
bitter
grassy
flavors
some
slightly
sweet
malty
flavors
clean
crisp
really
niceactive
carbonation
this
is
the
very
definition
of
session
beer
id
love
to
have
this
again
and
would
really
love
to
see
more
beers
available
in
the
style
very
frsh
clean
malty
aroma
with
soft
undertones
of
dried
leaves
nose
is
not
remarkable
but
is
inviting
the
first
sip
brings
an
unexpectedly
perfect
impression
of
anchor
steam
but
maybe
better
very
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
broad
fruitiness
that
gives
a
feeling
of
sweetness
but
isnt
really
sweet
dry
roasted
bittreness
in
the
finish
outstandingly
drinkable
a
perfect
session
beer
one
to
get
by
the
case
for
parties
or
bbqs
impressive
effort
overall
i
was
really
taken
by
suprise
on
this
one
it
was
a
hoppy
little
ale
that
i
did
not
see
coming
nice
balance
and
feel
lef
to
this
one
being
a
favorite
of
mine
over
the
last
week
or
so
i
would
have
to
recommend
this
one
for
sure
drinkability
thanks
to
wankerweasal
for
the
teaser
with
any
luck
perhaps
i
can
find
another
one
of
these
at
dld09
to
rereview
this
was
really
a
delightful
beer
and
delightful
is
not
a
term
that
i
use
lightly
because
it
usually
sounds
fruity
so
when
i
say
delightful
you
better
believe
that
i
fucking
mean
it
d
a
good
drinkable
beer
would
be
great
for
a
session
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
slick
with
medium
density
and
mediummild
carbonation
this
is
a
wellrounded
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
amount
of
foam
and
sparse
lacing
aroma
of
pale
and
vienna
malts
backed
up
by
a
nice
hop
freshness
slightly
nutty
on
the
palate
dry
as
can
be
some
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
dry
and
crisp
somewhat
refreshing
needs
more
carbonation
i
must
say
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
its
decent
but
nothing
i
would
search
out
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
picked
this
bomber
up
for
5
99
at
the
andersons
store
in
dublin
oh
i
thought
it
might
be
a
german
helles
lager
a
style
i
crave
always
but
it
turns
out
i
was
wrong
its
a
steam
beer
clone
a
style
im
not
crazy
for
the
beer
is
light
copper
colored
and
clear
with
a
really
thick
wet
foam
the
smell
is
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
just
biscuity
malt
and
a
hops
bitterness
without
the
good
hops
aromatics
the
taste
is
sort
of
bland
as
well
well
balanced
but
with
a
lingering
hops
bite
which
isnt
pleasant
no
flavors
that
really
make
it
for
me
the
bodys
just
about
medium
which
is
just
about
right
for
the
style
i
suppose
and
drinkability
is
ok
except
for
the
bitter
aftertaste
not
badly
made
but
not
really
my
choice
for
a
summer
day
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
halfinch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
very
good
the
aroma
is
very
light
but
nice
it
smells
like
some
toasted
malt
and
herbalgrassy
hops
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
sweet
and
toasted
malt
along
with
the
herbal
and
grassy
hops
starts
off
sweet
and
has
a
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
its
also
a
bit
creamy
and
coating
drinkability
is
decent
its
smooth
and
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
id
buy
it
again
good
close
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
this
brew
is
working
for
me
im
glad
it
came
in
a
22oz
bottle
because
it
sure
is
easy
enough
to
drink
well
done
flat
earth
id
be
glad
to
drink
this
during
the
hot
days
of
summer
which
it
currently
is
its
a
solid
brew
and
id
drink
it
again
but
wont
be
rushing
out
to
grab
more
d
pretty
good
d
ok
i
guess
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
and
search
for
this
one
element
115
was
discovered
in
2003
and
was
given
the
name
ununpentium
uup
flat
earth
brewing
tells
us
that
its
the
essential
component
that
allows
ufos
to
fly
element
115
the
beer
isnt
the
best
california
common
the
galaxy
has
ever
seen
but
its
more
than
solid
if
the
price
is
reasonable
id
gladly
buy
a
bomber
now
and
again
a
great
steam
beer
tasty
malts
and
hops
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
to
me
as
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
lots
of
come
summer
somewhat
simple
yet
with
depth
and
plenty
of
flavour
as
such
it
may
be
enjoyed
best
by
experienced
craft
beer
drinkers
or
at
least
those
who
enjoy
trying
new
things
hope
to
be
drinking
this
one
again
got
this
one
on
a
storekeepers
recommendation
when
they
were
still
waiting
on
a
shipment
of
surlys
turned
out
to
be
a
solid
find
and
ill
definitely
check
out
flat
earth
again
if
im
in
the
area
appearance
was
a
nice
orangy
amber
color
with
a
slightly
weak
head
nose
was
nice
lots
of
fruit
aromas
along
with
some
smoky
malt
taste
was
likewise
not
super
complex
but
tasty
with
the
smokiness
and
the
spicy
hops
and
fruit
i
might
have
guessed
this
was
a
spiced
beer
feel
was
good
medium
bodied
with
nice
fizzy
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
crystal
clear
dark
amber
with
a
rocky
off
white
head
that
leaves
very
decent
lacing
smell
is
fruity
berries
taste
is
pretty
clean
some
nice
balance
here
niether
the
hops
or
the
malt
is
jumping
out
at
me
yet
i
can
tell
that
both
are
there
the
aftertaste
is
drying
and
nice
the
feeling
it
leaves
in
the
mouth
is
not
quite
right
though
and
not
to
my
liking
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
dry
and
yeasty
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amberbronze
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
fresh
cut
grass
the
taste
has
more
grass
than
the
aroma
with
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
somewhat
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
flat
earth
can
do
much
better
the
color
was
a
shade
of
copper
i
was
very
disappointed
to
see
almost
no
head
or
lacing
i
could
pick
up
on
the
strong
hops
and
also
some
malt
on
the
taste
and
smell
it
was
a
little
bitter
and
had
dry
finish
it
had
very
little
carbonation
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
because
of
the
thin
body
the
style
suffer
and
thus
the
drinkability
suffers
d
i
think
this
might
be
appropriate
for
a
summer
night
not
a
january
night
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
wearing
layers
of
polar
fleece
as
i
am
now
the
sweet
citrus
of
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
warmer
weather
with
pleasantly
cool
nites
dreally
pretty
spoton
for
the
style
dont
care
for
the
excessive
dry
hop
finish
other
than
that
this
is
pretty
good
much
more
flavorful
and
impressive
than
anchor
steam
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
bitterness
and
a
small
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
a
small
bitterness
and
kind
of
watery
a
smooth
small
bitter
malt
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
small
hop
bitter
and
a
nice
malt
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
could
forsee
myself
drinking
this
on
an
almost
daily
basis
my
only
problem
is
that
it
only
comes
in
bombers
at
4
bucks
a
pop
too
not
that
the
price
is
bad
but
i
want
to
consume
this
in
mass
quantities
i
hope
that
some
day
ill
see
six
packs
in
the
store
for
now
ill
just
have
to
buy
the
occasional
bomber
22
oz
bottle
with
a
cool
label
and
great
beer

really

than
i
was
expecting
very
refreshing

medium

and
very
well
made
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
in
the
summertime
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
beersmooth
with
a
great

taste
and
great
balance
overall
carbonation
may
hurt
appearance
but
does
nothing
to
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
of
this
beerif
anything
it
makes
it
a
easy
and
great
choice
to
enjoy
just
one
or
for
a
session
feel
is
about
medium
with
a
bit
of
a
thinnish
front
that
is
really
the
only
partial
compliant
as
it
makes
up
for
it
as
it
goes
it
gets
a
bigger
body
and
growth
of
flavors
and
length
as
it
snaps
into
place
the
rest
of
the
way
even
though
this
has
its
complexities
i
needed
a
bit
more
out
of
it
other
then
the
yeasty
play
that
seems
to
be
the
main
attirbute
of
the
flat
earth
line
thus
far
enough
with
the
yeast
alreay
give
me
some
more
malt
and
hops
please
but
be
that
as
it
may
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
is
fairly
enjoyable
for
its
bomber
worth
beyond
that
it
become
tiresome
this
bottle
has
carbonation
a
small
head
with
moderate
sticky
lacing
much
better
tasting
as
well
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
and
hop
bitterness
nice
carbonation
adds
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
overall
i
will
raise
the
score
1
point
in
each
catagory
clear
copper
body
and
a
big
bubbly
off
white
head
lacing
is
sporadic
aroma
is
quite
nice
sweet
caramel
like
malts
and
nice
fruitiness
fruits
come
at
you
with
pear
pulp
apple
skin
and
concord
grapes
yeast
adds
a
little
doughy
dimension
to
the
nose
this
flavor
profile
is
quite
interesting
its
got
the
appropriate
clean
malt
flavors
but
also
some
pizazz
this
is
coming
from
the
spicy
hops
and
estery
yeastiness
its
a
great
touch
to
this
beer
honeyed
malts
form
a
nice
base
pepper
notes
accent
nicely
as
well
the
beer
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
its
not
flat
but
is
on
that
side
of
the
spectrum
body
is
about
medium
or
so
it
goes
down
quite
easily
as
it
is
very
flavorful
i
hope
i
passed
the
audition
pleasant
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
which
is
what
i
usually
get
from
california
commons
this
beer
appears
to
have
been
reformulated
since
its
initial
release
and
to
me
it
is
all
the
better
for
it
it
pours
a
clear
light
amberbrown
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
quickly
there
is
a
pleasant
malty
smell
now
the
taste
is
of
a
biscuity
maltiness
with
a
slight
brown
sugar
sweetness
finishing
with
a
hint
of
hop
goodness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
initially
the
hop
flavor
was
much
more
pronounced
to
the
detriment
of
the
other
more
delicate
flavors
the
only
other
beer
of
this
style
that
ive
triedanchoris
not
particularly
hoppy
either
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
it
goes
down
easily
this
is
a
nice
version
of
afor
the
twin
citiesrarely
brewed
style
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
throughout
the
summer
i
hope
plenty
of
people
do
a
terrific
effort

jeff

makes

really
eager
to
taste
beer
3
tasted
this
one
at
the
happy
gnome
in
st
paul
mn
it
poured
a
goldenamber
color
oh
no
is
this
going
to
be
another
boring
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
the
first
thing
i
smell
is
hops
a
good
sign
so
far
my
first
taste
leads
to
a
surprising
thicker
mouthfeel
considering
the
color
and
lager
style
the
malt
profile
is
bready
and
sweet
but
not
heavy
and
balances
out
nicely
with
the
assertive
hops
interesting
hop
flavors
of
pine
grapfruit
and
citrus
this
beer
is
complex
as
i
can
clearly
pick
out
the
smoothness
of
lager
and
the
malty
ale
characteristics
its
a
beer
that
will
make
you
say
hmmmm
good
to
see
a
california
common
fresh
from
mn
that
delivers
oh
and
i
found
out
from
the
brewer
that
element
115
is
an
undiscovered
element
on
the
periodic
table
however
experts
claim
that
combined
with
another
element
it
is
what
makes
ufos
fly
cool
this
is
beer
is
a
little
simple
for
beer
geek
but
i
can
see
it
being
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
the
friends
of
beer
geeks
the
malt
is
very
mellow
with
a
little
caramel
and
the
flavor
is
dominated
but
hops
fruit
flavors
it
was
highly
drinkable
nothing
special
but
tasty
nonetheless
tried
this
one
on
tap
last
night
appeared
a
goldencopper
color
and
clear
smell
is
woodsy
with
a
lot
of
pine
and
grass
type
aromas
very
interesting
hopping
taste
follows
along
the
same
lines
nice
beer
drinkable
i
will
try
another
one
next
time
i
spot
it
somewhere
i
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
beer
on
two
occasions
over
the
past
few
days
and
am
glad
to
see
yet
another
nice
offering
from
flat
earth
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
copper
color
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
complex
hop
aroma
that
runs
the
range
from
citrusy
to
grassy
and
floral
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
pronounced
hop
glavor
and
bite
great
balance
the
lagerlike
properties
really
shine
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
surely
i
could
sit
down
and
have
a
few
and
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
em
good
beer
nice
to
see
this
style
at
a
local
brewery
had
a
pint
of
this
new
beer
at
the
happy
gnome
i
havent
had
too
many
steam
beers
maybe
ill
try
another
anchor
after
this
one
flavorful
but
not
over
the
top
a
solid
beer
overall
no
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
have
never
seen
this
before
so
i
am
assuming
it
is
a
hard
beer
to
find
in
the
southeastern
us
overall
it
grows
on
you
a
whole
lot
somehow
warmth
does
this
beer
a
huge
favor
while
it
continues
to
be
just
as
refreshing
and
pronounced
as
ever
i
know
warmth
in
a
summer
beer
may
go
against
the
refreshing
idea
but
i
felt
like
when
it
sat
and
warmed
up
it
really
became
amazingly
enjoyable
kind
of
felt
this
was
more
of
a
saison
of
sorts
crossed
with
a
pils
i
dont
know
its
very
good
and
very
well
achieved
the
amount
of
flavor
and
potency
that
is
in
this
beer
for
such
a
low
abv
is
astounding
this
is
a
super
foamy
beer
that
pours
a
light
tanamber
color
it
smells
grassy
like
a
justmowed
lawn
even
theres
a
big
bouquet
of
grassy
spicy
piney
hops
nothing
at
all
like
the
blonde
ales
ive
come
to
expect
its
fullflavored
with
grassy
hops
and
a
slight
taste
of
alkaseltzer
that
came
through
as
i
sipped
curiously
so
in
fact
it
wasnt
offputting
but
not
necessarily
something
id
want
either
finishes
nicely
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
enough
effervescence
to
keep
it
light
a
decent
beer
and
as
i
said
its
full
of
flavor
and
not
alcohol
pretty
good
beer
even
tho
i
accidently
left
it
exposed
to
the
sun
for
a
short
time
each
day
for
about
2
weeks
and
it
doesnt
remind
me
so
much
of
a
steam
beer
so
much
as
perhaps
a
farmhouse
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
thick
creamy
off
white
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
medium
light
amber
aroma
is
big
on
yeast
then
bitter
citrus
malt
flavor
is
much
like
nose
not
overly
sweet
some
barnyard
finishing
off
with
a
taunt
of
banana
but
is
dominated
by
yeast
body
is
very
good
and
excellent
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
is
still
dominated
by
yeast
for
that
i
dont
make
it
a
session
interesting
to
try
and
enjoyable
this
time
but
thats
about
it
d
incredibly
easy
drinking
thats
for
sure
i
like
the
aggressive
hops
considering
the
style
light
refreshing
give
it
a
shot
for
what
is
and
is
trying
to
be
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
this
pours
a
bright
golden
straw
color
with
great
foaming
i
get
notes
of
toasted
corn
cereal
and
a
fresh
cut
grassy
aroma
its
fresh
and
vibrant
and
that
continues
on
the
flavor
with
a
sharply
focused
lemony
bitterness
theres
a
strong
grassy
note
which
runs
through
along
with
lemony
citrus
and
some
lemongrass
as
well
more
of
an
earthy
vs
fruity
hop
profile
and
it
ends
with
a
dry
finish
while
it
is
not
one
i
would
rate
as
accurate
to
the
style
it
is
a
tasty
brew
indeed
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangegolden
with
a
soapy
white
head
asymmetrical
lacing
around
the
edges
as
the
head
dissipates
some
green
grape
and
unripe
banana
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
very
little
carbonation
clean
flavor
with
some
tart
fruit
that
gets
accentuated
by
the
hop
character
at
the
finish
anyone
who
knows
me
knows
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
this
brewery
and
this
offering
is
no
exception
i
really
enjoy
how
the
ante
is
upped
for
the
style
on
the
hops
but
in
an
herbal
and
grassy
way
and
not
in
a
chop
citrusy
american
ipa
type
way
if
youll
excuse
me
im
off
to
get
another
pour
highly
recommended
both
on
cask
and
on
draft
this
was
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
it
worked
well
with
the
pizza
i
had
that
night
a
good
take
on
the
style
had
this
ontap
at
the
trappist
in
oakland
ive
listed
this
as
yearround
as
it
seems
to
be
one
of
their
staple
beers
pretty
nice
beer
of
a
style
that
is
rarely
done
good
job
with
this
one
i
look
forward
to
seeing
more
from
this
brewery
33cl
pour
for
5
pours
a
hazy
darker
golden
with
a
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
in
the
nose
there
is
lots
of
graininess
and
quite
a
lot
of
bitter
earthy
hops
as
well
personally
i
think
the
two
work
well
together
here
tastes
very
interesting
the
typical
yeastiness
of
the
california
common
runs
throughout
with
a
good
deal
of
grassy
and
herbal
flavors
as
top
notes
lots
of
grain
grass
and
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
quite
substantial
in
flavor
for
the
style
but
then
again
the
style
is
so
rarely
made
and
somewhat
loosly
defined
so
lets
just
say
this
is
a
flavorful
contribution
to
the
style
smooth
and
thicker
than
other
california
commons
ive
had
really
quite
nice
and
very
nice
to
have
fresh
and
ontap
on
a
lazy
late
afternoon
wonderful
lovely
sweet
malt
not
unlike
a
kellerbier

wasnt

what
to
expect
from
this
as
i
was
unfamiliar
with
the
term
dampfbier
until
now
wasnt
a
good
sign
when
i
uncapped
it
and
it
immediately
foamed
over
after
the
overactive
effervescence
dissipated
quite
quickly
its
a
pretty
goodlooking
beer
nice
medium
amber
opaque
but
no
haze
didnt
get
a
lot
on
the
aroma
so
cant
comment
there
but
the
taste
really
did
not
do
it
for
me
everything
about
this
beer
was
mild
to
the
point
of
bland
except
the
metallic
aftertaste
combine
that
with
a
dry

and
i
wasnt

and

would
call
this
a

cant

to

an
a
this
is
the
second
icelandic
beer
ive
had
both
from
this
brewery
and
ive
been
quite
impressed
with
each
of
them
ive
been
meaning
to
try
a
steam
beer
for
a
while
now
and
although
skjalfti
doesnt
exactly
have
the
brand
recognition
of
anchor
steam
i
still
think
this
made
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
style
its
a
little
pricy
to
be
a
realistic
session
option
in
these
parts
but
easily
worth
a
try
and
i
will
probably
pick
it
up
again
some
time
generally
im
not
that
big
of
a
fan
of
brews
where
the
hop
bitterness
outweighs
the
hop
flavour
but
thats
a
personal
preference
and
ill
have
to
dial
it
in
with
a
few
more
steam
beers
to
see
whats
good
for
the
style
anyway
i
found
that
the
style
was
really
well
balanced
and
delicious
a
good
one
oa
decent
beer
in
this
style
reasonable
session
beer
clear
copper
body
and
a
pile
of
offwhite
head
decent
retention
and
patch
lace
bready
and
floral
aromas
predominate
with
lesser
notes
of
citrus
and
sulfur
toasted
malt
and
tangerine
hop
flavour
with
balancing
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
big
and
bold
by
any
means
just
a
good
balanced
profile
lightbodied
but
not
thin
low
carbonation
smooth
nice
session
lager
o
decent
ipa
it
was
good
to
try
but
i
found
it
way
to
one
dimensional
o
given
the
style
the
flavour
profile
was
quite
loaded
worth
a
try
but
nothing
mind
blowing
pretty
decent
stuff
o
nothing
crazy
about
this
beer
i
could
easily
turn
this
into
a
session
beer
but
might
get
a
little
bored
after
awhile
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
right
away
this
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
doppelbock
from
the
smells
and
even
initially
on
the
tastes
as
well
i
did
really
enjoy
this
one
although
i
kind
of
had
low
expectations
which
i
am
quickly
finding
out
that
these
scandinavian
offerings
are
a
little
more
above
average
than
i
initially
thought
great
balance
although
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
but
i
do
like
the
ice
sweet
caramel
bread
malts
mixed
with
the
mild
hop
presence
and
an
even
more
mild
citrusy
fruit
presence
in
there
as
well
all
in
all
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
a
few
more
of
this
one
because
i
actually
liked
it
d
this
is
actually
the
first
steam
beer
ive
had
so
ive
little
to
compare
it
to
that
said
its
a
refreshing
and
pleasant
middleground
between
ale
and
lager
well
worth
trying
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
brew
but
i
wouldnt
likely
seek
this
one
out
again
o
refreshing
lager
picked
up
from
the
lcbo
somehow
tastes
very
similar
to
grand
river
curmudgeon
ipa
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
my
go
to
iceland
beer
the
flavour
is
lightly
roasty
with
medium
malt
sweetness
and
a
refreshing
bitter
finish
flavourful
and
drinkable
lager
not
unlike
anchor
steam
oi
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heart
beat
really
interesting
find
for
the
lcbo
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
some
lace
nose
has
some
distinct
grassiness
fairly
leafy
taste
has
more
of
the
grassiness
in
it
bitterness
is
evident
but
not
overpowering
again
leafy
with
some
pine
notes
as
well
moderate
malt
base
some
breadiness
but
subdued
a
bit
of
butter
finish
lingers
a
bit
but
overall
a
decent
beer
pours
a
nice
copperamber
colour
decent
white
head
light
traces
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
not
overly
aromatic
but
nice
smooth
malt
light
citrus
mildly
hoppy
taste
is
crisp
a
nice
hop
presence
is
there
nice
malt
a
really
flavorful
lager
good
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
refreshing
very
smooth
perfect
carbonation
really
solid
beer
nice
flavourful
lager
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
top
notch
bottled
wheat
sharp
citrus
with
a
nice
head
on
the
pour
clean
finish
the
light
amber
colour
was
surprising
i
thought
it
a
most
delicious
pint
and
would
partake
of
its
wheatiecitrusness
again
and
again
and
again
and
again
but
probably
not
again
after
that
a
basic
and
mostly
unmemorable
beer
though
its
wellmade
enough
and
pretty
drinkable
id
probably
drink
this
sometimes
as
a
sessionable
beer
if
i
lived
in
iceland
to
try
keeping
things
local
here
in
canada
there
are
too
many
other
good
beers
similar
to
this
one
hoppy
aroma
and
well
balanced
taste
with
a
nicely
bitter
finish
a
very
nice
surprise
pleasant
and
unique
to
me
at
least
offering
that
ill
have
to
try
again
d
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
see
enjoying
this
a
lot
in
the
summer
a
nice
offering
and
my
first
experience
with
the
steam
beer
style
outside
of
anchor
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
smoked
stout
from
the
brewery
later
this
year
drink
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
to
see
it
on
the
shelves
sure
hit
the
spot
while
watching
nfl
football
today
another
well
crafted
beer
from
these
guys
really
i
am
very
happy
to
have
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
happy
that
the
skjalfti
will
be
available
at
the
lcbo
it
can
be
hard
these
days
to
find
a
good
full
flavored
lager
the
ölvisholt
brugghus
skjalfti
is
a
premium
lager
which
honorably
reflrects
the
style
and
has
provided
me
with
the
perfect
solution
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
straw
colour
with
a
head
that
recedes
leaving
no
lacing
sweet
malt
and
earthypine
hops
are
balanced
in
the
light
aroma
but
theres
a
mediumhigh
level
of
bitterness
that
stands
out
which
lingers
too
long
in
the
aftertaste
for
my
palate
clear
light
gold
and
decent
head
nose
has
an
odd
fruitiness
to
it
lychees
and
tropical
fruit
fairly
bitter
and
sharply
carbonated
again
with
a
lychee
flavour
quite
dry
and
a
bit
astringent
with
a
herbal
hop
light
toasted
grain
and
caramel
round
out
the
flavours
a
little
bit
on
the
acidic
side
as
well
this
one
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
but
overall
drinkability
isnt
bad
a
nice
drinking
beer
worth
trying
while
i
may
not
be
able
to
pronounce
its
name
i
can
say
for
certain
that
skjálfti
is
good
beer
and
ölvisholt
brugghús
seemingly
is
a
gem
of
a
little
brewery
the
name
of
the
beer
translates
to
earthquake
ironic
considering
it
brings
the
two
continents
styles
together
rather
than
dichotomize
them
i
understand
that
icelanders
have
a
reputation
for
drinking
a
lot
but
with
offerings
like
this
who
can
blame
them
d
nice
solid
session
brew
i
dig
the
idea
of
a
hoppedup
steam
beer
and
the
nose
on
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
if
it
tasted
a
bit
more
like
it
smelled
id
actually
get
this
semiregularly
an
excellent
summer
quaff
its
only
too
bad
that
the
price
doesnt
correspond
still
a
quality
offering
and
i
would
gladly
try
whatever
else
makes
its
way
here
from
the
faroff
land
of
ice
yellow
body
with
initially
a
foamy
head
wafts
initially
a
cheesy
aroma
then
reverts
to
a
neutral
one
a
little
lagerish
taste
a
tad
beow
average
mouthfeel
drinkable
but
not
too
drinkable
and
500
ml
is
too
much
for
me
rather
uninteresting
overall
a
decent
lager
and
one
that
i
could
happily
drink
on
the
patio
perhaps
not
enough
complexity
for
many
repeat
visits
buta

of

taste
is

dominated
by
floral

with
a

with

there

with

not
bad
thought
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
and
the
light

touch
is
not
that
pleasant
reminds
me
of
brooklyn
lager
though
i
think
i
like
this
one
better
pours
a
copper

with
a
nice

smells
sweet
like
fruit
candy
almost
taste
has
some
hops
with
a
strong

backbone
very
bready
type
taste
that
has
some
type
of
fruit
in
there
very
smooth
and
a
great
drinker
probably
not
going
to
buy
a
lot
at
the
price
in
ontario
but
a
very
nice
beer
well
done
iceland
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
sleeper
hit
for
the
summer
this
beer
smacks
of
quality
and
has
a
very
unique
personality
all
its
own
i
dig
it
high
marks
for
this
one
will
it
knocn
you
off
your
feet
nope
but
i
cant
come
up
with
any
drawbacks
and
it
fits
the
style
to
a
t
i
felt
almost
obligated
to
pick
this
one
up
because
of
the
rarity
or
rather
lack
of
availability
of
the
style
and
im
very
happy
i
did
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
beer
would
be
on
my
top
three
to
turn
to
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
the
perfect
season
to
do
it
i
just
saw
this
today
at
the
lcbo
how
nice
to
be
the
first
reviewer
from
toronto
for
a
change
big
foamy
offwhite
head
three
fingers
low
moderate
carbonation
lots
of
sticky
sheet
lace
in
due
course
the
head
settled
into
a
few
large
beige
blotches
floating
atop
a
clear
copper
brew
there
was
a
citrus
fruit
hoppy
aroma
on
the
pour
and
more
sweet
apricot
and
bready
malt
nose
after
it
breathed
quite
a
pleasant
smelling
beer
the
taste
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
with
pine
flavour
and
a
resiny
mouthfeel
earthy
swallow
more
pine
and
bitterness
in
the
long
lingering
finish
mouth
is
pine
resiny
medium
body
buttery
texture
no
hint
of
volcanic
ash
whatsoever
overall
not
bad
at
all
and
id
gladly
have
another
a
very
satisfying
but
quenching
lager
with
the
unique
character
of
ale
hopped
balance
great
innovation
i
want
more
of
this
to
sweet
and
buttery
in
my
opinion
had
a
bottle
of
this
in
stockholm
last
weekend
poured
with
a
white
light
head
and
lace
color
was
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
aroma
was
nice
with
a
slightly
smokey
very
slight
citrus
and
apricot
characteristics
flavors
the
same
nice
body
excellent
finish
a
session
beer
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
product
interesting
enough
to
keep
going
back
to
and
pairs
superbly
well
with
varyous
dishes
both
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
beer
has
changed
alot
since
it
was
first
launched
back
in
march
2008
towards
hops

abv
this
could
be
the
start
of
a
long
relationship
but
availability
appears
to
be
a
bit
hit
miss
so
if
you
find
it
give
it
a
try
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
had
a
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
a
good
stab
at
the
california
common
style
could
have
a
bit
more
bright
flavors
had
this
on
tap
at
birdsall
house
in
peekskill
it
is
my
first
steam
beer
so
maybe
this
is
how
the
style
is
supposed
to
taste
this
beer
was
completely
unbalanced
with
a
weak
malt
presence
and
an
over
the
top
yet
extremely
bitter
hop
profile
if
you
like
to
drink
a
glass
of
bitter
hops
then
this
beer
is
for
you
i
proceeded
to
drink
a
few
west
coast
ipas
after
this
one
that
completely
blew
me
away
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
though
no
where
near
their
other
hoppy
offerings
some
nice
floral
and
citrus
in
the
nose
though
the
taste
has
less
easy
to
drink
a
nice
light
beer
but
would
highly
recommend
their
other
ipas
if
youre
looking
for
something
hoppy
however
the
unfiltered
lager
aspect
with
this
along
with
the
tons
of
citrus
hops
really
makes
this
hoppy
lager
a
drinkable
and
really
enjoyable
beer
o
surprised
that
this
is
a
california
commonsteam
beer
as
it
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
an
apa
or
an
ipa
there
is
a
pleasant
amount
of
hoppiness
that
makes
this
one
quite
enjoyable
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
great
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
definitely
a
keeper
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
a
tasty
well
balanced
ale
very
sessionable
i
generally
do
not
gush
about
pale
ales
i
tend
to
like
good
ones
as
much
as
the
next
guy
but
this
one
was
particularly
good
and
i
had
a
few
of
them
in
a
session
the
aroma
is
floral
hoppy
with
a
very
nice
finish
of
mt
hood
hops
which
lend
an
astringent
earthy
hop
character
to
the
mix
i
also
blended
the
hop
common
with
another
peekskill
pale
wake
up
call
on
a
34
to
14
basis
favoring
the
hop
common
excellent
as
a
blend
as
well
o
love
the
style
and
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
would
have
liked
to
see
some
more
head
retention
taste
was
overall
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
significant
improvement
from
the
old
hop
common
very
easy
to
drink
pairs
great
with
wings
overall
i
could
have
had
more
than
one
of
these
especially
in
warm
weather
nose
just
like
the
taste
great
balance
juicy
hops
in
the
middle
very
piney
and
grassy
cereal
malts
a
bit
sweet
on
the
finish
with
moderate
carbonation
leaving
a
great
mouthfeel
silky
smooth
a
burnt
orange
color
topped
with
a
dense
head
of
foam
hop
common
is
definitely
sessionable
and
pairs
very
well
with
the
food
on
the
menu
at
the
brewpub
the
first
sip
tasted
woody
and
left
lacing
on
my
pint
glass
nicely
carbonated
and
somewhat
dry
this
well
balanced
beer
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
hoppy
finish
regularly
on
tap
and
well
executed
its
worth
a
try
either
on
its
own
or
along
with
some
of
peekskills
other
brews
yes
siree
i
could
do
with
a
sixer
or
two
of
this
one
great
to
see
something
different
from
a
brewpub
i
believe
peekskill
brewery
is
relatively
new
but
theyve
got
some
tastee
brews
over
there
this
may
be
my
favorite
yet
a
great
drinking
local
brew
the
beer
was
a
looker
nice
dark
copper
color
with
solid
lacing
it
was
a
mix
between
an
american
ipa
and
a
cali
common
good
taste
and
decent
mouthfeel
a
solid
mix
between
anchor
steam
and
a
traditional
ipa
the
pubs
best
offering
hop
common
from
the
peekskill
brewery
and
that
of
defiant
brewing
in
pearl
river
ny
are
one
of
the
same
as
the
brewmaster
at
defiant
produces
some
of
the
brews
served
at
peekskill
brewing
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
grapefruit
and
sticky
hops
dominate
the
palate
and
nose
in
what
is
simply
an
ez
drinking
and
immensely
enjoyable
hop
laden
brew
fantastic
acid
balance
giving
this
concoction
extreme
drinkability
served
in
a
proper
pint
on
scene
you
will
simply
love
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
peekskill
pours
clear
lighter
copper
amber
supporting
a
middle
of
the
road
off
white
head
and
then
showing
better
then
average
lace
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
nose
balanced
brew
toffee
malts
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
and
grainy
hops
nothing
special
but
a
decent
offering
for
a
tiny
brwery
that
is
hosting
a
boatload
of
guest
taps
and
still
searchingfinding
its
way
with
its
own
brews
poured
ontap
at
the
tap
house
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
caramel
coloring
with
a
sparse
filmy
head
nose
of
nut
and
honey
with
roasted
overtones
flavors
are
more
of
the
roasted
character
with
a
honey
and
toast
blend
to
follow
richly
sweet
aftertaste
with
caramel
and
honey
notes
on
a
smooth
body
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
but
slightly
cloying
o
its
a
meatier
california
common
than
most
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
an
anchor
steam
but
this
one
seems
to
be
a
touch
sweeter
with
much
more
toasted
character
it
grew
on
me
after
while
started
out
as
a
letdown
but
i
came
away
liking
it
alright
clear
amber
colored
brew
under
a
small
wispy
white
head
smells
mild
and
pleasant
sweetish
doughy
malt
and
herbalfloral
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
a
somewhat
buttery
element
light
herbal
leafy
hop
flavor
over
cereal
grain
and
warm
biscuit
malt
medium
bodied
and
bitter
in
the
finish
enjoyable
on
a
very
warm
late
spring
night
taste
is
bready
but
also
fruity
maybe
apples
or
pears
some
decent
noble
hops
smooth
mouthfeel
without
too
much
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
plenty
of
kick
too
at
6
1
although
the
chalkboard
at
the
brewery
said
5
8
whats
3
between
friends
not
outstanding
but
very
nice
with
a
lot
of
flavor
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
solidly
made
less
than
eight
miles
from
my
door
sweet
overall
like
i
mentioned
my
first
steam
beer
and
it
was
suprisingly
fruity
and
tasted
great
still
not
very
good
at
reviewing
so
take
this
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
not
the
beer
because
its
perfect
the
way
it
is
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
small
bit
of
lacing
not
much
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
some
toasty
highlights
and
hints
flavor
is
quite
bready
and
grainy
some
generous
chocolate
flavors
as
well
as
the
fully
toasted
bread
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
arrives
in
the
finish
and
balances
this
one
out
quite
nicely
not
quite
bitter
enough
and
i
think
too
much
breadiness
and
roastiness
for
the
style
ive
had
this
beer
from
a
growler
before
and
did
not
notice
any
sourness
or
creaminess
ill
chalk
that
up
to
maybe
a
dirty
line
otherwise
this
beer
is
smooth
and
drinkable
nice
to
have
something
different
from
a
local
brewer
overall
a
decent
beer
nice
to
just
chill
with
i
personally
like
the
hoppy
finish
and
think
that
is
a
nice
touch
as
well
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
for
a
newer
nc
brewery
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pintglass
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
almost
no
head
aroma
is
slight
sweet
malts
and
a
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
an
interestingly
hoppy
version
of
a
steam
beer
a
nice
hoppy
lager
the
beer
is
fairly
light
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
but
nothing
all
that
special
o
i
not
not
have
much
experience
with
this
style
i
think
anchor
is
the
only
other
that
i
have
tried
after
reading
the
description
it
seems
to
follow
the
guidelines
it
just
seems
like
a
boring
style
to
me
it
is
easy
drinking
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
euro
lager
the
steamy
windows
is
decent
not
spectacular
the
beer
i
had
was
overprimed
which
im
sure
affected
the
taste
and
scent
the
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
huge
white
fizzy
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
scent
was
grassy
like
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
overall
it
was
ok
o
holy
shit
batman
this
is
amazing
beer
it
is
definitely
california
common
aka
steam
beer
but
the
added
bonus
of
the
light
spicing
and
fruit
esters
make
this
really
refreshing
the
sweet
to
bitter
balance
could
not
be
more
perfect
i
will
go
back
to
this
again
and
again
when
i
am
in
michigan
puremichigan
craft
beer
has
a
certain
quality
that
cannot
be
replicated
by
industrial
multinational
breweries
nor
by
homebrewers
and
starter
kits
as
a
microbrewery
you
never
want
your
beer
to
resemble
either
of
those
extremes
steamy
windows
the
only
beer
ive
yet
to
try
from
liberty
street
brewing
seems
like
it
could
have
been
made
by
either
thats
not
a
good
first
impression
nothing
mind
blowing
here
but
it
was
certainly
something
you
could
kick
back
and
drink
a
bunch
of
without
getting
fatigued
or
drunk
for
that
matter
mellow
and
contempt
i
think
i
may
actually
prefer
this
one
to
anchor
steam
although
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
that
one
maybe
too
long
to
compare
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
but
something
id
get
from
time
to
time
at
the
brewpub
for
a
relaxing
change
of
pace
overall
very
easy
drinking
and
approachable
very
well
balanced
overall
this
is
nothing
like
the
steam
beer
i
tried
by
anchor
brewing
i
dont
particularly
like
it
overall
i
wasnt
a
fan
or
impressed
by
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
below
average
example
of
the
style
it
was
pretty
dull
and
somehow
managed
to
be
rough
around
the
edges
it
didnt
have
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
and
the
taste
for
sure
didnt
hold
my
attention
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
i
dont
want
to
drink
another
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
seemed
pretty
true
to
style
but
it
could
have
been
a
little
smoother
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
pretty
simple
and
dull
and
the
flavors
didnt
seem
nearly
as
clean
as
they
should
be
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
worth
my
time
and
i
cant
say
that
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
let
down
with
this
beer
so
far
liberty
street
has
been
disappointing
me
both
the
beers
they
have
bottled
have
been
pretty
underwhelming
with
this
one
being
the
worst
of
the
two
i
know
they
can
make
some
good
beer
i
have
had
them
before
but
if
they
keep
bottling
these
bland
beers
instead
its
not
going
to
work
out
good
for
them
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
needs
some
work
and
so
far
its
my
least
favorite
beer
from
liberty
street
overall
this
just
isnt
a
beer
i
see
myself
seeking
out
again
its
the
definition
of
an
average
brew
overall
this
beer
did
not
bring
a
lot
to
the
table
but
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
id
probably
pass
on
it
for
something
else
though
overall
nice
flavor
and
easy
drinking
but
if
i
wasnt
told
it
was
in
the
cal
common
style
i
would
have
though
it
was
simply
another
amber
lager
i
could
have
another
this
is
tasty
dvery
easy
drinking
quite
flavorful
too
taste
is
hoppy
smooth
wet
great
tasting
not
overly
complex
or
challenging
but
really
good
it
seems
to
me
that
liberty
street
just
brews
solid
gold
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
ordering
when
i
said
i
wanted
a
steamy
window
but
im
willing
to
do
that
here
because
i
know
they
dont
brew
garbage
another
great
brew
i
just
wish
more
people
could
experience
these
brews
instead
of
just
people
in
southeast
michigan
overall
very
interesting
brew
nice
tropical
hops
nope
westwesterncaliffornia
as
in
steam
only
i
couldnt
tell
because
this
had
an
awfully
muted
hop
profile
for
a
steam
beer
its
got
the
pretty
hazy
fizzy
copper
color
of
anchor
steam
and
the
aroma
is
nice
crisp
very
pale
malt
tastes
like
the
pale
malt
mixed
with
some
light
german
hops
and
finishes
with
bready
wonderfully
done
yeast
nice
and
well
balanced
but
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
for
a
steam
on
tap
at
tomlinson
tap
room
this
is
a
lager
per
the
brewers
website
but
it
really
does
have
some
amazing
pale
ale
attributes
meant
for
i
believe
poured
a
very
nice
copper
color
with
excellent
head
and
some
nice
lacing
very
clean
and
crisp
malty
scent
with
a
huge
hit
of
citrusy
hops
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
malty
flavor
with
a
huge
citrus
hop
hit
at
the
end
which
gives
it
just
a
bit
of
roughness
overall
quite
good
a
nice
blend
of
lager
and
pale
ale
attributes
the
flavor
takes
hold
of
the
tastebuds
and
gives
them
a
good
thrashing
with
raw
leafy
hop
cones
and
a
peppery
carbonation
level
the
german
lager
yeast
is
apparent
adding
a
hint
of
sulfury
goodness
but
this
beer
tastes
much
more
alelike
than
i
had
expected
the
alcohol
nips
at
the
back
of
the
palate
with
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
bold
yet
restrained
with
a
medium
consistency
and
uppity
carbonation
juicy
and
crisp
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
kick
of
hop
oils
all
in
all
a
delightfully
fresh
hoppy
ipa
kudos
to
sun
king
and
thanks
again
to
brundo4
for
a
killer
trade
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
stands
just
over
an
inch
tall
retention
is
good
and
as
i
drink
it
leaves
some
beautiful
lacing
in
my
glass
smell
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
orange
hop
aroma
taste
is
smooth
with
floral
and
citric
hops
malts
are
bready
go
figure
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thicker
than
expected
with
average
carbonation
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
nice
and
easygoing
a
solid
offering
from
everybodys
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
small
but
creamy
cap
of
white
head
moderate
steady
carb
aroma
is
crisp
with
fresh
hops
and
grains
biscuity
taste
well
balanced
with
grassy
and
piney
hops
with
light
fruit
notes
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
quite
nice
overall
a
really
solid
pale
ale
in
my
book
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
and
a
good
dose
of
flavour
and
aroma
hops
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
or
so
of
think
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
with
fruity
hops
and
malty
sweetness
the
taste
begins
malty
sweet
and
then
switches
to
citrusy
hops
and
then
finishes
with
more
complex
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
it
finished
clean
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
suggest
it
to
anyone
had
about
4
pints
of
this
back
to
back
and
love
it
its
enough
to
get
me
back
to
the
establishment
serving
it
great
job
on
a
great
nw
brew
d
an
outstanding
steam
beer
i
would
love
to
try
it
again
next
to
anchor
steam
and
see
how
the
two
compare
i
feel
like
this
is
a
good
contender
i
actually
had
it
in
the
sampler
and
enjoyed
it
enough
to
drink
a
full
pint
afterward
overall
a
very
good
bordering
on
great
beer
worth
some
effort
to
try
washington
state
produces
precious
few
california
common
or
steam
beers
this
one
is
bright
orangetopaz
unfiltered
and
sports
a
thick
lumpy
head
of
duff
it
has
a
grainy
aroma
and
a
light
quaffable
body
but
the
clean
lagered
crispness
youd
expect
is
absent
as
is
any
visual
clarity
while
not
a
dramatically
flawed
beer
daily
bread
cant
compare
to
west
coast
standards
from
the
likes
of
anchor
or
heater
allen
and
doesnt
make
for
a
choice
pick
among
everybodys
regular
offerings
wicked
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
hoppy
beer
the
fact
that
they
apparently
brewed
this
with
a
lager
yeast
at
ale
yeast
temps
didnt
really
impart
much
character
chico
ale
yeast
is
just
as
neutral
but
its
never
the
less
a
tasty
beer
in
the
classic
local
style
the
fact
that
i
can
get
my
hop
fix
without
much
alcohol
really
helps
a
session
beer
for
hop
heads
o
pretty
easy
drinking
with
good
woodsy
hop
flavor
and
supporting
malt
nice
balance
pretty
good
overall
d
not
a
big
light
lager
drinker
but
i
like
this
one
short
and
sweet
and
good
thats
enough
dont
you
think
im
just
going
to
enjoy
it
very
drinkable
the
solid
mouthfeel
and
relatively
light
but
not
bland
flavor
make
this
a
good
session
candidate
taste
is
mostly
citrus
bitter
lemon
with
at
most
a
faint
hint
of
grapefruit
which
is
strong
in
the
aroma
plus
some
pine
and
peppery
leaf
it
has
light
toasty
malt
sweetness
underneath
the
somewhat
sharp
vaguely
leafypepperycitrusrind
bitterness
that
dominates
fully
from
start
to
finish
but
not
aggressively
it
is
good
but
the
bitterness
is
just
too
sharp
and
lingering
enough
to
throw
off
the
balance
and
reduce
drinkaiblity
toasty
bready
or
even
donuty
mildly
carbonated
with
a
nice
hoppiness
in
contrast
to
the
soft
cloudy
strawberry
blond
grapefruit
color
the
foam
is
hilariously
giant
and
bright
white
a
fun
blend
of
organic
malt
hops
and
yeast
it
can
be
complex
if
you
want
it
to
be
but
never
in
a
way
that
interferes
with
your
ability
to
enjoy
your
food
or
company
its
more
robust
compared
to
a
steam
beer
california
common
like
anchor
steam
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
the
wonderful
freshbaked
bread
smell
or
maybe
its
the
hops
it
has
a
pleasant
bitterness
to
it
and
a
really
great
sweet
grassy
finish
thats
short
but
bold
cali
common
would
be
a
great
dinner
beer
for
hearty
vegetable
dishes
pastas
beans
or
big
salads
with
whole
grains

nobel
hop
bitterness
in
the
nose
with
clean
light

too
lots
of
noble
hop
character
plenty
of
drying
bitterness
and
some
underlying
doughy
honeysweet
malt
fairly
robust
for
a
light
lager
a
nice
drinking
beer
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
or
a
camping
trip
bottle
home
this
beer
pours
a
bright
tangerine
orange
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
its
a
nice
looking
beer
leaving
lots
of
lacing
also
the
label
is
well
designed
and
professional
a
solid
look
for
the
new
company
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
noble
hops
and
possibly
a
bit
of
west
coast
grapefruit
rind
flavor
but
im
terrible
at
guessing
ingredients
theres
a
nice
doughy
yeast
note
in
there
too
the
flavor
has
a
good
bitterness
of
the
noble
hop
variety
its
nice
and
dry
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
would
be
nice
for
a
session
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
full
and
has
a
touch
of
hop
oil
a
pleasant
lager
that
would
pair
well
with
a
variety
of
meals
o
its
a
sweet
and
rich
beer
that
has
just
enough
bitterness
to
cut
it
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
without
having
to
think
too
much
nice
enough
flavours
could
definitely
drink
all
night
but
just
doesnt
interest
me
that
much
i
found
this
beer
to
be
exceptionally
lacking
in
style
or
imagination
its
not
even
particularly
well
crafted
for
what
it
is
id
say
that
it
feels
bythenumbers
but
i
think
it
even
falls
short
of
that
i
was
pretty
unimpressed
o
balanced
and
smooth
great
if
you
arent
sure
whether
you
want
a
pale
ale
or
sweet
lager
overall
this
is
a
definite
favorite
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
before
and
will
probably
have
it
again
the
feel
is
bright
fluffy
and
creamy
this
is
a
very
lightbodied
brew
though
by
no
means
thin
its
got
enough
of
a
crisp
edge
and
smooth
flow
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
pours
a
clear
slightly
hazy
vivid
copper
gold
nice
foamy
white
head
smells
very
good
crisp
citrus
hops
grain
and
lager
yeast
tastes
very
refreshing
clean
and
fresh
citrus
hops
and
lager
the
body
is
light
and
fits
well
with
the
other
components
active
carbonation
that
doesnt
get
in
the
way
a
nice
surprise
extra
in
a
trade
paired
well
with
a
steak
teriyaki
dinner
this
pours
with
a
toasted
strawtan
color
with
nice
creamy
foam
and
a
lingering
hint
of
tartness
on
the
nose
it
has
an
almost
biscuitytart
flavor
which
makes
it
much
more
interesting
than
your
typical
california
common
or
steam
beer
at
least
in
my
experience
theres
a
lightly
lemony
hop
aroma
with
some
sweetish
biscuit
notes
on
the
flavor
the
citizen
reminded
me
in
some
aspects
of
the
tartness
from
a
berliner
weiss
beer
combined
with
a
lighter
anchor
steam
d
very
drinkable
nice
california
common
with
a
good
malt
and
hop
balance
however
the
girl
running
bartender
at
this
establishment
was
far
more
flavorful
than
the
brew
blonde
beautiful
bountiful
and
with
a
smile
on
her
face
what
a
treat
almost
any
beer
is
certain
to
be
delectable
in
her
presence
this
is
the
cismontane
that
i
hoped
for
from
the
time
i
first
tasted
them
its
copper
color
and
good
head
retention
leave
a
good
first
impression
on
the
citizen
sourbdough
bread
and
a
floral
note
in
the
nose
good
tasting
stuff
sourdough
at
first
softer
notes
of
pine
floral
and
citrus
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
the
california
common
is
anything
but
common
to
find
so
its
great
to
see
cismontane
doing
a
style
other

beers
taste
like
your
in
a
dark
tavern
standing
at
the
bar
while
the
bar
tender
turns
the
wooden
handle
and
out
flows
a
foamy
froth
of
goodness
these
beers
are
excellent
like
drinking
right
out
of
wooden
keg
ahrrg
m
chewy
medium
body
medium
carbonation
o
despite
the
malty
taste
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
it
has
a
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
the
ironhorse
common
steam
beer
from
argus
is
decent
steam
beer
the
beer
poured
a
nice
rich
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
carries
a
slight
yeast
like
spice
so
does
the
taste
i
want
to
say
rye
but
not
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
argus
california
style
steam

overall
drinkability
i
would
like
to
give
this
another
shot
serving
type
ontap
simply
excellent
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
head
not
too
much
of
a
strong
scent
but
there
are
malts
and
hops
present
starts
off
smooth
and
semibold
with
malty
flavor
but
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
drinks
rather
smooth
and
fast
as
i
found
myself
not
wanting
to
make
the
dry
after
taste
last
long
a
nice
find
and
a
slightly
better
than
average
brew
o
the
crisp
hoppy
lagered
beer
is
very
sessionable
with
some
bright
hop
flavors
that
are
nice
the
fizz
could
be
a
bit
softer
but
even
with
the
full
fizz
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
to
big
to
be
crisp
and
refreshing
but
that
is
fine
with
me
o
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
hopforward
character
for
a
california
common
the
spicy
bitterness
becomes
a
little
overpowering
and
makes
me
think
this
beer
is
contending
more
with
american
pale
ales
than
steam
beers
wish
there
was
more
malt
but
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
tastes
like
lightly
toasted
water
crackers
meat
very
mineral
rich
water
there
is
a
metallic
twang
i
dont
like
crackers
meets
cut
grass
that
was
left
out
in
the
rain
o
easy
drinkin
decent
beer
falls
way
short
of
anchors
o
decent
drinkability
decent
amount
of
flavor
o
a
good
session
beer
that
would
go
good
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
not
horrible
but
not
great
reminds
me
of
a
homebrewed
version
of
honkers
ale
hoping
this
beer
unlike
its
two
predecessors
wont
sully
my
glass
too
much
it
pours
a
clear
wan
bronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
sweet
flowers
light
honey
wheat
and
light
buttery
biscuits
the
taste
doesnt
change
much
of
this
up
but
the
sweetness
and
the
graininess
are
both
increased
together
making
for
an
interesting
flavor
combination
not
unlike
lightly
sweetened
corn
flakes
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
an
okay
brew
one
that
doesnt
impress
but
also
one
that
doesnt
necessarily
disappoint
either
its
a
nice
easydrinker
something
some
might
call
a
good
lawnmower
beer
i
could
drink
anything
afterduring
yardwork
so
this
term
has
little
meaning
to
me
mellow
feel
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
grassy
and
floral
again
some
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
lingering
into
the
finish
a
bit
of
smooth
maltiness
husks
and
all
a
simple
flavor
with
a
bigger
sip
there
is
more
residual
bitterness
that
builds
in
the
aftertaste
overall
its
a
simple
utilitarian
session
beer
clean
with
no
flaws
it
just
may
not
hold
interest
for
everyone
overall
a
quaffable
well
balanced
beer
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
foamy
dense
clingy
offwhite
head
nose
of
sweet
nut
roasted
notes
and
hints
of
caramel
sweet
malty
forward
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
throughout
roasty
and
sweet
on
a
smooth
light
body
sweet
roasted
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
with
a
smooth
slightly
lingering
finish
well
put
together
balanced
and
tasty
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
big
richlooking
creamy

on
top
spicy
leafy
hop
aromas
balanced
by
toast
and
crackerlike
malts
leafyearthy
hops
continue
into
the
flavor
lightly
oily
and
mild
overall
and
some
nutty
caramel
malt
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
bitterness
a
nice
beverage
to
start
out
with
a
decent
lager
that
is
drinkable
enough
and
has
a
good
flavor
seems
like
a
session
candidate
i
am
not
personally
crazy
about
it
but
i
cant
fault
it
for
anything
really
taste
is
better
than
anchor
steam
hints
of
banana
but
its
really
lost
in
the
background
to
the
malt
its
really
just
a
adjunct
lager
brewed
at
ale
temperature
good
beer
but
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
this
is
a
nice
beer
a
great
take
on
the
style
this
is
probably
one
of
the
hoppiest
lagers
ive
ever
had
and
it
was
balanced
and
delicious
overall
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
offering
from
fullsteam
but
it
is
an
accessible
easydrinking
beer
that
serves
as
a
fine
flagship
for
the
brewery
the
competition
between
sweetness
and
light
bitterness
works
well
here
and
i
probably
prefer
this
to
the
couple
of
other
steam
beers
ive
had
before
anchor
troegs
it
has
an
added
caramel
malt
sweetness
that
provides
some
contrast
well
done
carolina
common
southern
lager
whatever
its
called
its
very
good
poured
into
a
becker
a
slight
chill
hazed
amberbronze
with
a
large
fluffy
crown
atop
that
left
broken
lace
as
it
settled
into
a
frothy
mass
toasty
and
bready
in
the
nosequite
yeasty
as
well
with
light
fruity
esters
a
little
sharp
in
the
mouth
but
not
anything
to
hindering
going
onflavors
are
yeasty
and
toastedsome

thruoughta
decent
drying
earthy
finish
a
full
flavored
steam
beer
wich
i
think
is
an
under
appreciated
stylea
very
nice
lager
beer
d
highly
drinkable
the
flavor
is
complex
yet
not
challenging
body
and
alcohol
level
are
low
to
medium
just
a
solid
everyday
session
beer

coincidentally

whatever
the
hell
that
means
might
as
well
be
from
the
home
state
d
very
high
ill
drink
a
growler
of
this
right
next
to
the
carber
anyday
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
regional
style
the
additional
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
the
elevated
fermentation
character
adds
a
dimension
to
the
beer
that
takes
it
in
a
completely
different
direction
than
anchors
steam
beer
fairly
firm
bitterness
but
with
some
residual
sweetness
in
the
finish
that
competes
for
dominance
a
good
solid
beer
decent
session
drinker
but
just
not
my
style
a
clear
caramel
copper
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
says
wheat
and
yeast
with
some
spiciness
the
flavor
is
unique
a
bitter
leafy
hop
over
biscuity
fruit
sweetness
i
get
apple
melon
and
bright
toasted
pumpkin
its
a
crispy
feel
with
tingly
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
definitely
quite
drinkable
as
well
recommended
for
a
try
and
something
i
would
quench
my
thirst
on
any
time
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
a
nice
forward
presence
not
much
in
the
middle
and
a
mild
bitterness
with
a
mild
dry
finish
to
the
whole
thing
i
like
it
the
dryness
isnt
distracting
or
palate
wrecking
its
a
decent
beer
id
have
it
again
also
of
note
was
the
growler
glass
itself
which
was
quite
cool
ontap
at
rockfish
grill
served
in
an
18oz
schooner
a
crisp
amber
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
with
slight
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
crisp
earthy
citrus
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malts
the
beer
is
very
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
another
great
beer
from
fullsteam
while
its
not
my
personal
favorite
of
theirs
i
can
see
it
as
worthy
of
being
their
flagship
exceptionally
smooth
drinking
lager
poured
from
a
1
pint
bottle
first
chance
to
finally
try
a
tg
not
disappointed
would
definitely
recommend
enjoyed
at
hunahpus
day
2015
at
cigar
city
brewery
in
tampa
nice
easy
drinking
lager
great
price
this
is
weird
and
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
surprisingly
bitter
citric
yeasty
with
little
maltiness
definitely
interesting
overall
picked
up
a
bomber
in
wiscoland
to
continue
trying
the
available
tg
beers
this
is
usually
on
the
shelf
but
i
had
avoided
it
due
to
it
being
a
lager
it
is
well
made
and
a
pretty
solid
beer
other
than
the
smell
leans
a
bit
too
much
towards
malt
liquor
fusels
this
is
basically
a
yuengling
lager
i
thought
that
it
was
a
kellerbier
more
than
a
california
common
and
it
has
something
macro
lager
though
it
is
unfiltered
i
think
the
price
point
is
a
bit
high
for
a
bomber
i
could
find
beer
that
is
simple
and
easytodrink
in
a
sixpack
for
just
under
twice
as
much
it
is
easytodrink
wasnt
too
impressed
overall
after
drinking
there
ipa
and
apas
i
cant
drink
lighter
beers
anymore
but
it
compares
well
with
the
style
opened
1
ended
going
back
and
getting
three
more
these
things
are
truly
awesome
maybe
just
not
my
style
but
it
didnt
really
have
enough
to
impress
me
had
a
very
macro
taste
and
feel
i
have
to
admit
that
this
wasnt
the
beer
i
was
expecting
if
rating
strictly
to
style
i
would
be
much
more
harsh
because
well
this
isnt
a
california
common
it
neither
looks
smells
nor
tastes
like
one
more
of
a
kellerzwickel
to
be
honest
after
realizing
that
this
wasnt
the
amber
lager
i
thought
i
was
pouring
it
took
me
a
couple
minutes
to
get
into
it
alas
once
i
reset
my
expectations
this
is
actually
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
mellow
and
light
but
nuanced
and
reasonably
complex
with
no
noticeable
flaws
and
a
wellbalanced
flavor
im
not
sure
id
need
to
get
this
one
again
i
like
lagers
just
as
much
as
the
next
guy
but
this
was
pretty
standard
maybe
twas
overhyped
for
me
a
simple
beer
but
executed
without
flaw
extremely
drinkable
a
pretty
good
beer
from
a
not
overly
popular
style
i
figured
tg
would
have
went
the
nontraditional
route
on
this
beer
but
it
appears
they
chose
to
be
very
restrained
with
it
very
cloudy
light
straw
colored
body
kind
of
looks
like
pee
very
sweet
yeasty
smelling
sweet
tasting
kind
of
a
dough
flavor
pretty
good
for
a
lager
overall
pretty
flavorful
for
a
lager
very
malty
though
id
like
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
delivers
what
it
says
it
does
a
mild
lager
that
still
brings
plenty
of
flavor
to
the
palate
and
is
clean
of
any
off
flavors
nice
after
having
so
many
ipas
and
hop
soaked
brews
o
i
turn
down
nothing
these
guys
do
they
seem
to
do
either
everything
right
or
throw
away
everything
that
isnt
up
to
a
standard
congrats
o
nothing
flashy
but
sturdy
and
very
welldone
at
5
a
bomber
its
still
23
cents
an
ounce
that
equates
to
16
50
for
a
sixpack
cmon
tg
start
bottling
in
smal
format
already
so
while
this
was
worth
trying
the
one
time
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
at
least
not
for
a
while
o
folks
just
dont
get
to
excited
about
drinking
lagers
but
for
lager
lovers
try
saying
that
10
times
fast
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
i
do
think
this
should
be
available
in
6
packs
rather
than
bombers
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
light
pale
lager
style
nice
crisp
grainy
malt
notes
with
some
light
citrus
notes
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
lagers
but
this
one
is
far
better
than
most
its
bright
flavorful
and
clean
excellent
this
being
my
first
encounter
with
this
style
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
that
said
the
end
of
my
only
bottle
had
me
wishing
i
had
purchased
more
its
delicious
incredibly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
make
this
inoffensive
beer
a
must
have
o
if
you
like
lagers
well
done
and
i
do
then
this
one
is
great
for
the
style
pours
out
a
darker
yellow
in
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
quite
refreshing
as
i
havent
had
a
lager
for
quite
some
time
i
can
smell
a
little
sweet
malts
and
maybe
some
hops
in
there
that
add
to
the
sweetness
but
seem
complimentary
nothing
strong
in
the
nose
here
pretty
tame
as
expected
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
toned
down
hops
to
balance
i
get
a
real
buttery
taste
to
the
beer
which
is
unique
and
surprising
mouthfeel
is
thin
as
one
would
expect
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
lager
the
taste
is
quite
unique
with
the
buttery
notes
and
was
a
nice
surprise
what
can
you
say
here
just
an
all
out
excellent
lager
its
hazy
and
darker
than
just
blonde
maybe
light
buttery
in
color
with
a
viscous
white
froth
of
head
daily
aroused
the
nose
is
bread
and
cereal
grain
heavy
definitely
robust
compared
to
most
what
i
like
about
this
the
most
is
that
is
so
flavorful
while
being
distinctly
american
it
doesnt
rely
on
german
malts
or
czech
hops
to
make
it
flavorful
and
interesting
it
moves
well
beyond
that
but
it
still
falls
nicely
into
the
style
guidelines
while
doing
something
very
different
cereal
grain
flavor
lots
of
body
and
a
gently
citrus
hop
note
from
about
the
middle
onward
clean
finish
lager
yeast
is
richer
than
most
just
such
a
layered
and
well
done
beer
especially
for
a
lager
i
could
drink
this
continuously
fuller
bodied
lush
in
feel
refreshing
enough
but
thats
not
the
point
here
a
great
lager
world
class
in
my
opinion
well
hopped
flavorful
grainy
clean
full
light
to
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
you
can
tell
when
you
drink
this
beer
that
it
is
well
made
but
there
is
nothing
that
jumps
out
and
grabs
your
attention
either
i
am
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
though
awso
sweet
grandma
dorothy
would
surely
be
proud
overall
not
bad
lots
of
flavor
for
a
light
lager
lots
of
dough
and
cracker
straw
etc
and
plenty
of
lager
yeast
notes
but
not
super
crisp
like
the
beer
wants
to
be
a
big
imperial
lager
but
stays
soft
and
light
enjoyable
and
refreshing
bottle
from
omensetter
pours
a
mostly
clear
pale
golden
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
is
grainy
malty
a
little
citrus
no
hop
presence
at
all
taste
is
medium
sweet
maybe
slightly
bitter
a
little
fruity
finish
lightly
sweet
a
hint
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
there
isnt
a
lot
going
on
here
but
its
solid
o
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
a
very
good
lager
more
complexities
from
hops
than
most
lagers
my
second
offering
from
tg
and
another
solid
brew
not
a
great
beer
but
solid
and
since
it
was
a
tg
brew
i
would
take
it
over
other
lager
offerings
d
overall
this
is
a
really
nicely
put
together
lager
california
common
at
5
99
a
bomber
its
good
but
i
dont
think
i
would
revisit
it
maybe
on
tap
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
of
bread
faint
toffee
honey
and
floral
hops
it
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
it
is
still
very
pleasant
the
taste
has
all
the
elements
of
the
aroma
but
with
a
little
more
power
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
wont
seek
out
again
glad
to
try
it
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
though
oone
of
my
favorite
easy
drinking
beers
of
alltime
a
keg
of
this
at
a
summer
pool
party
would
be
perfect
i
could
drink
this
every
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
really
really
like
this
one
flavor
is
mild
light

it

easily
drinkable

deceptively
simple
pretty
much
how
a

should
taste
a

overall
but
given
the
right

theres
nothing
better
not
much
to

about

very
very

d
all
around
great
refreshing
lager
light
and
crisp
i
dont
normally
drink
lagers
but
i
will
have
more
of
this
as
it
will
be
great
to
have
during
hot
summer
days
well
done
tg
worth
a
try
but
not
something
to
brag
about
easy
to
drink
above
average
lager
easy
to
drink
and
no
real
flaws
but
nothing
compelling
about
it
either
overall
it
certainly
is
more
fullers
than
anchor
steam
but
the
sweet
malt
compliments
this
beer
very
well
if
you
see
it
go
for
it
as
is
the
case
with
anything
toppling
goliath
makes

very
enjoyable
lager
that
is
fresh
crisp
and
refreshing
pretty
simple
but
it
has
a
subtle
complexity
and
balance
very
nice
on
a
summer

mouth
feel
was
nice
due
to
the
head
that
just
never
went
away

great
lager
during
a
hockey
game
nothing
if
not
bland
this
was
my
first
experience
with
baxter
brewing
co
and
i
must
say
im
disappointed
too
bland
for
my
taste
maybe
its
the
style
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
i
did
not
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
with
a
medium
body
that
goes
down
easy
there
is
some
hop
aftertaste
that
hides
until
the
end
and
makes
things
feel
bigger
than
before
o
definitely
grew
on
me
nice
to
have
a
sweeter
lager
thats
not
overly
sweet
overall
good
solid
lager
with
above
average
abv
5
3
that
doesnt
overpower
you
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
purchase
it
again
but
i
wont
be
rushing
back
to
the
store
for
more
pours
a
brownish
color
with
little
head
very
faint
smell
a
decent
little
lager
malty
and
an
easy
finish
nothing
spectacular
here
overall
good
though
pours
nicely
from
the
can
with
a
chestnut
brown
color
white
head
and
decent
lacing
mostly
clear
and
inviting
sweet
malts
upfront
on
the
nose
with
caramel
cherries
and
not
much
else
detected
very
light
aroma
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
malty
with
a
hint
of
damp
basement
inmouth
and
a
dryish
finish
sweet
tea
wood
chocolate
caramel
and
a
touch
if
sediment
round
out
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
unobtrusive
with
a
clean
finish
and
polished
overall
feel
overall
its
a
nice
lager
but
lacks
a
distinctive
trait
to
help
it
stand
out
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
crystalclear
copper
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
fluffy
clingy
offwhite
head
nose
of
toasted
grains
subtle
toffee
sweetness
and
roasted
notes
throughout
flavors
are
roasted
caramel
sweetness
forward
with
an
underlying
hops
bitterness
and
roasted
character
richly
sweet
throughout
on
a
slick
midbody
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
as
well
with
a
sweet
caramel
characteristic
and
some
nutty
notes
mixed
in
clean
smooth
finish
more
body
than
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
but
damn
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
not
bad
i
do
like
the
malt
base
and
aroma
is
decent
but
the
hops
turn
up
a
bit
too
much
on
the
taste
for
a
nice
lager
at
least
in
this
case
it
just
overpowers
it
something
like
american
darling
they
go
well
as
the
lager
and
malts
are
stronger
and
they
balance
this
just
goes
a
little
overboard
on
the
hops
still
a
nice
crisp
enjoyable
summer
lager
the
taste
is
better
balancedthe
hop
is
far
more
pronounced
dry
finish
but
with
a
caramel
overtone
the
aftertaste
is
biting
and
bitter
but
not
long
lasting
full
body
but
the
carbonation
is
high
as
well
overall
baxter
seems
to
have
phased
out
amber
road
in
favor
of
this
brew
i
dug
amber
road
a
lot
but
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
will
probably
appeal
to
a
broader
audience
i
had
one
with
a
grilled
cheese
on
a
sunny
day
and
it
was
as
we
say
in
maine
of
the
finest
kind
o
a
decent
brew
id
drink
another
one
overall
a
pretty
clean
solid
offering
from
baxter
definitely
better
than
most
of
their
stuff
ends
up
being
a
bit
too
sweet
and
lacking
crispness
towards
the
end
of
the
pint

the
beer
pours
a
creamy
very
light
amberrich
golden
color
with
a
silky
offwhite
head
of
mediumsized
bubbles
in
body
the
beer
is
clean
and
translucent
with
just
a
slight
haze
from
the
beers
rich
coloring
bubbles
are
a
constant
fixture
within
the
beer
and
punch
towards
the
surface
with
quite
a
lot
of
tenacity
keeping
the
head
rocky
at
about
a
fourth
of
a
fingers
width
the
head
leaves
some
nice
fluffy
lacing
as
it
moves
down
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
caramel
cream
corn
slight
cider
herbal
hops
and
a
finish
of
sweet
bread
the
cream
corn
is
a
little
strong
in
the
nose
but
not
offputting
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
with
a
bitter
back
finish
that
balances
out
the
beer
there
is
a
little
earthiness
in
the
beer
adding
slight
complexity
but
really
this
is
a
simple
sweet
and
bitter
beer
in
flavor
it
tastes
of
cream
corn
crackers
soft
caramel
and
very
faint
watermelon
these
flavors
slide
into
a
finish
of
herbal
and
grassy
bitter
hops
that
blend
and
mellow
the
sweetness
leaving
a
slight
metallic
twinge
on
the
finish
and
aftertaste
again
the
dms
seems
a
little
high
in
the
initial
sip
though
its
nicely
drinkable
and
inoffensive
as
you
drink
more
of
the
beer
the
bitters
tend
to
grow
and
provide
a
nice
bite
that
covers
up
much
of
the
cream
corn
character
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
bodied
with
just
a
little
gelling
the
carbonation
is
fluffy
and
full
and
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
nearly
syrupy
with
a
nice
little
crispness
on
the
finish
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
wet
but
fairly
neutral
making
it
perfect
for
another
sip
from
the
can
i
detect
little
to
know
change
in
the
drinking
experience
aside
from
the
slight
metallic
bite
which
is
actually
quite
pleasant
in
this
particular
beer
overall
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
simple
the
dms
is
a
little
high
but
still
manageable
and
the
flavors
are
all
inoffensive
id
place
this
a
step
above
the
adjunct
lagers
its
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
mild
in
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
amazing
either
a
nice
simple
almost
session
lager
big
fan
of
the
commonsteam
style
and
this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
very
small
field
light
golden
amber
color
which
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
aroma
was
pure
steam
beer
the
minty
woody
northern
brewer
hops
were
easily
picked
up
was
the
nice
biscuit
like
malt
backbone
the
taste
was
a
home
run
a
nice
fruity
malt
flavor
from
fermenting
at
ale
temps
with
just
enough
of
the
hops
coming
through
to
balance
the
beer
perfectly
overall
in
my
opinion
this
gives
anchor
steam
a
run
for
its
money
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
beer
fridge
a
nice
balance
is
found
between
the
earthy
hops
and
toasted
caramel
grains
very
crisp
and
one
that
can
be
quaffed
nice
to
see
someone
brewing
a
steam
beer
in
new
england
beer
pours
an
absolutely
crystal
clear

and
toasted

lacing
in
the
glass
initial

finishing
just
a
tad
drier
than
the
initial
taste
good
carbonation
level
very
pleasant
great
beer
in
a
style
that
is
so
often
overlooked
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
character
than
the
nose
with
the
same
caramel
maltiness
but
a
decent
bitter
and
dry
finish
drinkable
for
certain
ocommon
beers
have
never
been
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
one
is
different
ive
only
had
a
few
of
the
style
butt
his
one
is
probably
my
favorite
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
within
the
style
served
from
the
can
and
poured
into
a
12
oz
mug
the
appearance
is
goldenred
and
very
clear
the
aroma
is
very
much
sweet
without
a
hop
note
to
be
found
the
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
carbonated
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
goes
down
hill
it
is
an
absolute
malt
bomb
with
little
encouraging
me
to
open
the
next
can
from
the
6
pack

heads

my
local
priced
this
stuff
down
to
make
room
on
the
shelf
for
other
things
so
i
finally
pounced
on
it
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
barley
wild
rice
grass
and
a
touch
of
sweet
vinyl
the
taste
holds
note
of
wild
rice
vinyl
sharp
grass
flowers
and
indian
corn
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
stuff
just
didnt
jive
with
my
tastebuds
straight
up
overall
not
bad
other
than
the
obvious
big
infection
on
the
nose
but
somehow
not
affecting
the
taste
really
just
the
slightest
touch
on
the
finish
fairly
decent
taste
adn
could
have
been
a
better
nose
but
not
too
bad

obviously
not

was
tasty
for
what
was
there
very
smooth

crisp

good

nose
but
starts
to
fall
apart
as
it
warms
the

go
grassy
and
catty
and
the
spice
character
which
is
very
faint
goes
sour
in
the
nose
malt
gets
breaddier
but
like
sourdough
taste
is
breaddy
malt
with
a
try
at
some
sweet
citrus
in
back
it
puckers
from
bitter
fruit
because
the
lemon
got
pithy
husky
grainy
malt
this
is
no
girlie
beer
finished
dry
with
plenty
of
full
bodied
malt
drank
ok
but
not
great
because
of
hops
going
sour
and
a
taste
of
corn
on
the
back
palate
it
was
mildly
astringent
and
even
a
little
metallic
can
live
without
this
one
worth
a
try
ive
just
never
been

i

taste

with

ample

in

and
a

of
rounded
bitterness
in
the
close

a

off
but
nowhere
near
what
the
nose
was
hinting
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
okay
not
all
i
hoped
but
not
as
bad
as
feared
either
o
i
havent
had
too
many
cali
commons
but
this
matches
up
fairly
well
with
the
few
i
have
had
easy
to
drink
and
would
appeal
very
well
to
any
beer
drinker
craft
or
not
solid
three
heads
common
man
is
a
cloudy
golden
lager
with
a
very
generous
cream
colored
foam
that
lasts
in
huge
lumps
it
leaves
a
great
ring
of
foamy
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
light
grain
fruit
and
caramel
it
smells
fresh
its
soft
and
pretty
full
bodied
the
finish
is
sharp
dry
and
acidic
theres
a
bitter
lemon
peel
aftertaste
its
quite
topheavy
with
bitterness
it
is
a
lot
like
an
ale
maybe
an
ipa
or
an
esb
its
a
very
simple
wellblended
flavor
that
keeps
my
attention
recent
bottle
from
village

merchant
foaming

mildly
cheesy
average
mouthfeel
appropriate
carbonation
neutral
taste
nothing
special
soso
drinkability
for
what
it
is
better
than
a
macro
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
if
only
hot
tapwater
was
available
and
i
was
thirsty
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
light
even
flavoring
the
hoppy
inclusions
are
light
enough
to
not
be
offputting
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
hops
but
at
the
same
time
the
malts
were
overly
adjuncty
and
lacked
the
quality
of
flavoring
we
were
expecting
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
california
common
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
very
easy
to
drink
would
probably
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
modest
lacing
the
nose
is
bitter
and
hoppy
but
it
seems
like
they
used
that
completely
wrong
hop
one
which
doesnt
complement
the
lager
yeastiness
the
taste
is
equally
disappointing
with
an
average
lager
malt
followed
by
a
lingering
and
intense
bitterness
even
as
it
warms
its
still
very
bitter
but
starts
to
balance
out
substantially
not
terrible
but
not
desirable
either
overall
a
good
addition
to
the
three
heads
lineup
a
sessionable
beer
i
would
never
turn
down
i
had
this
at
lovin
cup
in
rochester
in
late
march
the
bartender
recommenced
it
i
had
never
heard
of
it
before
it
had
some
hops
to
it
but
lightly
done
so
you
could
get
the
full
taste
of
it
yet
it
was
also
really
smooth
hence
the
name
special
lager
i
guess
either
way
it
was
an
awesome
beer
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
ok
decent
beer
it
is
light
head
and
lacing
ok
color
is
nice
flavor
has
a
touch
of
citrus
and
malt
kinda
has
a
very
light
of
hint
of
maybe
a
lemon
muffin
hope
i
am
not
stretching
too
far
with
that
description
the
finish
has
good
carbonation
and
is
clean
and
crisp
by
no
means
am
i
comparing
to
a
michelob
ultra
but
this
beer
had
somewhat
of
a
similar
clean
dry
finish
i
liked
it
o
i
think
this
could
be
in
the
running
for
my
bmc
replacement
at
a
bbq
light
enough
great
feel
just
wonder
if
the
dryness
might
build
t
coarse
grains
bread
toffee
light
floral
hops
clean
lemon
pith
bitterness
dominates
the
finish
this
leans
heavily
to
the
hop
strong
bitter
pinelike
bite
surprising
given
the
balance
of
the
nose
relatively
easy
to
drink
low
to
moderate
body
but
highly
carbonated
this
resembles
a
bitter
american
pale
ale
o
like
the
taste
interesting
and
different
a
pretty
hoppy
common
and
would
do
well
in
the
summer
for
a
refreshing
drink
this
is
classified
as
a
steam
beer
but
it
sure
doesnt
taste
like
one
either
way
its
actually
a
real
unique
and
great
tasting
brew
unique
blend
of
malt
hops
give
a
up
front
hippy
malt
flavor
with
a
spicey
back
end
unfiltered
wit
appearance
with
a
malty
spice
aroma
good
hot
weather
beer
i
really
like
port
city
beers
this
one
just
happens
to
fall
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
port
city
is
a
great
brewery
optimal
wit
and
monumental
ipa
are
my
favorites
thanks
to
amyliz4
for
grabbing
this
growler
from
the
brewery
served
in
a
port
city
pint
glass
beer
is
a
pale
yellow
good
head
and
lacing
crackers
in
the
nose
faint
hops
toasty
and
a
bit
bready
fairly
dry
finish
medium
body
quite
tasty
and
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
on
the
front
a
lagerish
yeastiness
is
present
throughout
i
drink
all
the
steam
beers
i
can
get
my
hands
on
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
it
should
be
made
again
just
based
on
how
well
it
turned
out
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
feeling
for
style
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
all
things
considered
it
was
definitely
worth
saving
the
batch
instead
of
dumping
it
but
i
cant
say
id
be
making
it
a
regular
purchase
though
my
house
mate
and
i
bought
this
as
a
sixtel
for
our
newly
built
home
kegorator
being
that
we
live
in
northern
va
and
had
experienced
the
blackout
first
hand
we
were
intrigued
to
try
a
local
brew
that
resulted
from
the
power
outage
its
hazy
appearance
is
not
unlike
a
hefeweizzen
but
it
drinks
like
a
pils
it
holds
a
good
head
and
it
is
very
light
on
the
pallet
leaving
behind
little
more
than
light
citrus
and
bitter
hops
as
a
lastditch
effort
i
say
its
decent
if
it
could
be
improved
i
would
buy
this
again
the
beer
is
fairly
hazy
and
appears
golden
orange
hued
small
white
head
the
aroma
brings
citrus
malt
dank
hops
resin
smells
nice
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
grapefruit
rind
and
malt
presence
light
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
a
solid
example
of
the
style
for
a
flagship
beer
1888
can
hold
itself
together
its
a
drinkable
all
seasons
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
herbal
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
drinkable
but
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
i
like
the
throwback
idea
the
flavour
initally
was
not
too
hot
but
comes
back
around
as
i
drink
it
bottle
at
hitimes
very
local
a
solid
effort
in
the
end
o
hard
to
say
this
was
bad
because
it
wasnt
really
offensive
it
was
just
really
bland
ƭίcƙ
anchor
brings
forth
another
winner
im
just
not
vibin
with
it
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
really
has
a
great
smoothness
that
goes
down
very
easy
a
really
great
drinker
that
has
a
great
flavor
profile
this
beer
brought
the
flavor
and
really
left
the
bitterness
behind
interesting
complexity
this
one
starts
off
with
a
malt
base
that
succumbs
to
the
aforementioned
hop
bitterness
but
i
also
detect
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
in
the
swallow
yet
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
long
lasting
leans
to
the
full
body
side
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
can
label
art
is
very
legit
beer
pours
darker
than
expected
clear
amber
color
with
a
big
fluffed
head
rings
of
lacing
has
that
common
beer
aroma
the
dry
hops
dont
really
stand
out
in
the
nose
all
too
much
common
beer
yeast
which
i
find
to
be
very
distinctive
probably
anchors
house
yeast
sweet
bready
malt
very
esteryfruity
flavor
is
malt
and
yeast
dominant
fruity
esters
anchor
yeast
lagerishness
yes
lagerishness
bread
and
caramel
malt
soft
floral
hop
finish
really
cleans
up
with
a
lingering
apple
flavor
stimulating
carbonation
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
more
hop
less
sweet
next
time
reminds
me
of
a
maibock
draft
at
the
ba
brew
fest
on
12415
too
heavy
on
the
dms
for
me
lovely
finish
but
i
just
cant
get
away
from
the
canned
corn
flavor
very
drinkable
as
a
session
or
just
about
anything
else
clear
gold
under
a
foamy
head
that
fills
up
the
glass
toasted
biscuitlike
malts
honey
and
just
a
little
apple
melon
and
strawberry
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
flavors
of
bready
grain
grassy
bitterness
floral
hops
and
earthy
citrus
clean
and
crisp
easy
to
drink
similar
character
to
other
anchor
beers
not
much
of
the
expected
citra
and
nelson
qualities
its
good
not
as
good
as
their
lager
something
is
a
bit
off
bittering
is
too
overwhelming
for
my
palate
as
well
the
citra
and
nelson
dont
necessarily
stand
out
this
is
still
a
steam
beer
at
heart
with
some
additional
hop
nuances
however
its
still
a
huge
improvement
over
the
original
citra
and
nelson
sauvin
combine
very
well
citrus
minty
goodness
in
a
liquid
gold
frame
a
fabulous
brew
i
wonder
why
anchor
steam
limits
this
beer
to
cans
only
serving
type
on
tap
great
beer
i
tried
this
brew
a
couple
years
ago
and
just
tried
it
again
the
other
day
and
i
almost
forgot
how
good
this
brew
actually
is
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
just
have
to
try
might
be
the
most
overrated
beer
ive
had
fairly
ordinary
ale
with
the
usual
malty
aromas
and
bready
flavors
decent
hoppy
finish
love
this
for
a
tasty
refreshing
something
different
excellent
beer
very
drinkable
i
would
buy
this
any
time
on
any
occasion
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
very
drinkable
and
also
very
sessionable
not
a
very
overpowering
or
interesting
flavor
palate
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
they
were
intending
here
this
is
essentially
a
more
finely
crafted
take
on
a
standard
american
amber
lager
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
in
so
many
ways
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
great
the
combination
of
malt
and
hops
is
such
that
you
have
substantial
flavor
a
clean
finish
and
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
i
picked
this
up
to
celebrate
a
special
moment
and
it
absolutely
fit
the
bill
this
is
truly
a
world
class
beer
o
an
interesting
beer
very
unique
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
i
enjoyed
this
time
where
as
10
years
ago
i
disliked
taste
is
pretty
one
sided
nothing
special
anchor
needs
to
update
their
shit
o
i
was
quite
blown
away
by
this
beer
it
is
really
good
i
had
been
putting
off
trying
this
one
for
a
while
because
a
coworker
said
she
wasnt
a
fan
of
it
so
i
assumed
it
wasnt
good
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
if
you
are
into
breaddominant
flavors
this
one
will
sing
to
you
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
this
one
frequently
but
im
sure
itd
pair
well
with
a
plate
of
fish
and
chips
or
crab
cioppino
it
probably
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
cooking
with
and
it
may
seem
petty
but
i
have
always
loved
the
whole
package
of
anchor
beersthe
roundish
bottle
the
label
the
cap
maybe
im
a
little
oversensitive
after
having
been
away
pretty
nice
crisp
taste
its
like
a
hoppy
lager
wow
i
rated
this
higher
than
i
thought
i
would
but
i
sat
down
and
thought
and
thought
and
this
beer
to
me
is
unique
enough
and
so
incredibly
drinkable
that
i
had
forgotten
that
i
had
spent
a
couple
years
drinking
only
this
stuff
well
the
predominant
onhand
brew
its
very
good
and
a
bit
underrated
the
go
to
beer
period
o
solid
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
hits
most
of
when
i
look
for
in
a
solid
lager
style
beer
3
75
keg
of
anchor
steam
drank
the
flavor
profile
is
reasonably
intense
fairly
well
balanced
and
slightly
complex
it
begins
with
a
moderate
earthy
bitterness
that
slowly
fades
to
a
mild
caramel
and
biscuit
sweetness
the
middle
has
a
slight
lemon
zest
like
citrus
note
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
earthy
and
zest
bitterness
that
lingers
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
easy
to
find
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
was
pleasant
but
i
was
expecting
more
it
was
a
decent
tasting
beer
that
i
could
definitely
drink
it
again
as
a
light
sessionable
beer
i
would
like
to
try
a
slightly
fresher
bottledraft
just
to
see
if
four
months
is
a
bit
past
this
beers
prime
overall
refreshing
beer
a
bit
sweet
on
the
backside
keeps
it
from
being
exceptionally
drinkable
but
a
decent
beer
none
the
less
would
like
to
try
the
dryhopped
version
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
on
tap
it
was
a
bit
skunky
rough
after
taste
upside
way
better
than
heineken
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
is
decent
lacing
is
mild
has
more
of
a
sour
fruit
aroma
slightly
sweet
with
some
floral
notes
has
that
lager
type
taste
with
a
very
slight
sweetness
to
it
nice
bitter
hop
at
the
end
with
a
sour
fruit
aftertaste
not
much
of
a
lager
drinker
but
this
one
is
not
bad
and
definitely
worth
trying
it
is
my
first
try
at
a
cali
common
an
average
beer
nothing
special
has
a
slight
skunkish
smell
and
taste
to
it
lacks
depth
drinks
smoothly
with
moderatelight
carbonation
aftertaste
is
not
very
pleasant
but
not
harsh
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
not
a
winter
brew
early
spring
would
be
might
refreshing
a
great
tasting
beer
well
balanced
i
love
this
brown
ale
type
beer
clean
taste
with
a
creamy
head
you
can
really
taste
the
hops
and
malt
very
little
after
taste
o
solid
easily
drinkable
beer
o
anchor
steam
is
pleasant
enough
but
if
this
is
the
prime
example
of
a
california
common
theres
nothing
about
it
that
makes
me
want
to
explore
this
style
any
further
have
had
better
porter
but
not
bad
overall
quality
this
is
a
beer
you
have
once
in
a
while
in
between
heavier
beers
while
out
bar
hopping
it
has
plenty
calories
to
keep
you
going
solid
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
one
this
beer
had
the
look
and
smell
but
the
taste
didnt
tie
them
together
kinda
disappointed
from
the
brewery
reputation
the
mismatch
of
favors
got
me
o
very
clean
and
in
essence
what
a
massproduced
lager
could
be
rather
than
what
it
typically
is
i
enjoy
this
and
would
pick
it
up
again
but
i
can
say
i
do
not
find
the
style
to
be
as
compelling
as
some
nevertheless
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
dark
amber
color
had
on
tap
got
better
as
i
was
drinking
first
slightly
bitter
then
smoothed
out
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
o
similar
to
a
lager
in
its
smooth
drinkability
and
accented
bitterness
with
the
juicy
fruity
character
of
an
ale
very
distinctive
very
solid
amber
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
what
i
consider
a
nice
baseline
beer
and
then
you
start
getting
adventurous
with
hopsmaltspicesetc
as
a
brewer
to
build
upon
it
i
prefer
a
little
more
bitter
profile
but
i
would
never
turn
this
one
down
goes
perfectly
with
seafood
as
it
is
often
served
with
in
sf
very
good
amber
color
ale
an
american
classic
that
is
really
delicious
it
is
malty
sweet
with
grassyearthy
hops
and
a
clean
feel
a
beer
that
every
ba
should
eventually
try
it
has
a
strong
hoppy
taste
to
me
this
is
in
the
same
category
as
bmc
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
brilliant
blend
of
malt
and
hops
combines
the
clean
crisp
characteristics
of
a
lager
with
the
flavorful
bold
tastes
of
an
ale
fluffy
head
with
tanned
straw
color
smell
reminiscent
of
english
pubs
with
a
flavor
profile
to
match
served
a
bit
too
cold
but
a
quaffable
brew
nonetheless
love
it
but
to
me
it
only
tastes
really
good
in
the
bay
area
no
idea
if
its
the
atmosphere
or
the
climate
pretty
average
tasting
beer
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
nice
tasty
nontraditional
lager
with
barley
forward
slight
hop
finish
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
no
co2
carbonation
only
natural
carbonation
and
traditional
brewing
methods
a
real
pleasure
to
enjoy
and
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
seemed
fairly
bland
or
watered
down
still
better
than
typical
american
domestic
brews
decent
beer
nothing
remarkable
here
but
very
drinkable
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
pretty
smooth
going
down
man
im
tired
of
doing
this
flavorless
and
a
big
disappointment
really
drinkable
beer
my
new
goto
beer
bottled
on
91714
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
clear
reddish
gold
color
one
finger
white
thick
head
pretty
good
retention
and
nice
lace
aroma
is
malty
with
some
light
grassy
notes
taste
was
malty
like
the
aroma
with
some
peppery
flavors
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
but
very
crisp
almost
dry
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
quenched
my
thirst
very
nicely
what
the
hell
is
a
steam
beer
overall
not
a
style
of
beer
im
overly
familiar
with
i
cant
think
of
anything
comparable
in
the
uk
off
the
top
of
my
head
its
not
a
bitter
and
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
like
a
lager
either
either
way
given
a
choice
id
definitely
drink
it
again
my
goto
beer
when
nothing
else
sounds
good
love
the
bite
and
to
me
its
got
a
good
aftertaste
great
this
is
excellent
very
dry
has
a
nice
bitter
bite
to
it
very
unique
i
will
certainly
get
it
again
anchor
steam
beer
45
the
only
beer
i
didnt
finish
on
my
old
chicago
world
beer
tour
i
tried
it
about
2
years
later
thinking
it
might
have
been
a
bad
batch
it
wasnt
my
taste
buds
flip
inside
out
to
avoid
the
taste
of
anchor
steam
yecch
a
great
tasting
beer
perfect
balance
between
hop
and
malt
very
good
flavorful
but
not
to
heavy
never
really
liked
this
beer
i
feel
bad
cos
the
brewery
is
just
a
few
blocks
away
from
my
house
a
classic
pours
deep
amber
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
big
time
caramel
and
sweet
light
bodied
well
carbed
and
easy
drinking
that
sweet
caramel
carries
through
very
well
to
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hop
character
and
a
clean
finish
could
be
a
great
session
beer
i
dont
think
theres
ever
a
bad
time
to
crack
one
of
these
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
smooth
and
a
kinda
numbing
bitter
after
taste
really
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
wasnt
bad
but
also
wasnt
memorable
had
it
about
a
year
ago
poured
a
dark
golden
color
generous
head
nose
smell
was
the
good
beer
smell
the
head
stayed
right
with
it
while
i
drank
mouth
feels
good
not
bitter
aftertaste
nice
hop
taste
smooth
and
tasty
good
beer
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
this
beer
has
a
depth
of
flavor
that
appeals
to
me
highly
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
recommend
this
to
anyone
fabulous
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
unique
tasting
beer
and
style
never
had
anything
like
it
its
like
an
ale
but
its
a
lager
in
style
and
taste
as
well
some
of
the
flavors
are
hard
to
describe
without
sitting
down
with
a
glass
of
anchor
steam
and
figuring
it
out
on
your
own
but
that
makes
reviewing
and
tasting
beer
fun
it
would
be
great
with
hamburgers
hot
dogs
sausage
barbeque
or
any
grilled
meats
solid
beer
all
around
when
in
sf
you
pretty
much
have
to
have
an
anchor
steam
its
available
everywhere
and
its
what
the
locals
drink
goes
great
with
seafood
as
you
would
expect
nice
dark
beer
and
the
style
is
better
than
that
of
a
generic
brown
as
far
as
im
concerned
at
some
point
i
should
try
some
other
anchor
beers
too
overall
always
wanted
to
try
it
nice
historic
beer
that
seems
to
stay
within
its
style
it
is
a
little
middle
of
the
road
for
me
but
i
wanted
to
experience
this
style
i
would
like
to
try
it
with
seafood
perhaps
a
cioppino
or
crabs
cheers
sad
but
a
skunked
bottle
as
a
fresh
delivery
to
jims
im
in
love
with
california
made
beers
perhaps
im
biased
as
im
from
the
great
golden
state
this
beer
is
delicious
plain
and
simple
has
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
to
it
but
its
a
pleasant
one
i
like
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
love
supporting
ca
its
ok
its
pretty
damn
pricy
here
in
nyc
ive
only
had
this
when
friends
had
it
in
there
fridge
i
would
never
buy
it
give
me
a
lagonitas
ipa
instead
this
beer
is
much
better
than
this
app
nice
balance
malty
with
the
right
spicy
hop
notes
to
bring
it
into
focus
a
nice
brown
with
a
prolific
head
after
a
hard
pour
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
classic
brew
overall
a
great
beer
malty
and
delicious
definitely
worth
the
legendary
status
that
it
has
earned
im
certainly
getting
much
more
of
this
nothing
very
memorable
for
me
o
nice
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
i
happened
to
watch
the
episode
of
michael
jacksons
beer
hunter
about
this
brewery
having
this
beer
in
my
fridge
the
program
gave
a
pleasant
image
about
the
brewer
and
i
think
that
made
this
beer
taste
even
better
when
i
had
it
on
the
next
evening
good
beer
that
tastes
like
a
beer
should
nice
looking
bottle
and
label
my
first
of
this
variety
so
not
sure
how
it
compares
other
than
that
its
ok
nothing
remarkable
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
again
but
would
drink
if
offered
one
overall

excellent
beer
simply
not
my
favorite

but
certainly
unique
a
classic
and
something
easy
to

highly
recommend
to
keep
a
sixer
stocked
in

a

overall
definitely
a

kind
of
reminiscent
of
an
amber
but
realistically
not
that
close
as
theres
a
lot
more
in
terms
of
different
flavours
going
on
and
a
great
sweet
finish
definitely
worth
repeating
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
will
definitely
try
again
this
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
that
will
inspire
a
revelation
or
challenge
your
convictionsalthough
it
might
be
a
revelation
in
that
to
me
this
is
what
a
basic
simple
beer
could
and
should
be
and
it
might
challenge
your
convictions
if
youve
been
succumbing
to
pretension
and
fad
brews
thinking
that
only
an
esoteric
style
or
brewing
method
or
exotic
ingredients
can
result
in
a
glass
full
of
joy
this
beer
is
zen
like
for
me
overall
really
tasty
mouthfeel
was
the
weakest
link
but
this
is
a
great
session
beer
enjoy
o
begging
forgiveness
not
at
all
familiar
with
california
steam
beer
this
just
wasnt
bad
at
all
its
like
my
opinion
of
belgian
beers
they
just
have
their
own
little
thing
going
on
my
first
impression
honestly
so
this
is
what
happens
when
you
ale
a
lager
give
me
another
try
next
summer
food
match
this
is
such
a
wellcrafted
and
balanced
beer
that
it
would
match
with
almost
anything
beef
pork
poultry
and
fish
they
would
all
work
with
this
you
decide
i
may
be
sentimental
but
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
long
before
the
craft
beer
revolution
this
was
the
one
that
started
it
for
me
that
said
given
the
style
i
still
think
its
an
awesome
beer
its
not
going
to
blow
you
away
but
then
again
that
is
not
its
intention
just
a
great
drinking
beer
of
a
unique
style
i
always
come
back
to
this
beer
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
quintessential
california
beer
a
tan
to
amber
color
with
a
good
foamy
head
lots
and
lots
of
aroma
and
the
taste
is
equally
strong
and
fruity
with
caramel
and
coffee
undertones
had
it
on
tap
and
out
of
the
bottle
its
a
great
beer
i
first
drank
this
beer
in
1987
and
its
still
a
great
beer
if
youre
an
ale
fan
youll
like
this
gem
from
the
city
by
the
bay
unique
in
its
combination
of
appearancetastemouth
feel
combination
i
cant
believe
i
havent
tried
this
beer
until
just
now
i
have
to
say
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
great
but
i
was
quite
impressed
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
yet
what
it
does
it
does
well
the
most
noticeable
characteristic
is
the
bold
toasted
malt
the
hop
bitterness
is
subtle
but
does
a
nice
job
of
balancing
out
the
malt
overall
a
beer
that
id
go
for
again
i
really
did
myself
a
disservice
by
not
trying
this
before
cheers
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
just
wish
there
were
a
better
balance
between
the
malt
backbone
and
the
hop
flavor
just
seems
to
me
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
roastyness
and
has
no
counterpart
to
balance
the
beer
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
would
chose
other
beers
first
overall
would
definitely
consider
this
for
a
hot
day
tailgate
session
you
get
the
picture
kind
of
beer
easy
to
drink
doesnt
taste
like
hell
after
it
warms
up
in
fact
maybe
tastier
after
it
gets
a
little
warmer
depending
on
your
palate
a
simple
beer
balanced
well
that
provides
you
with
maximum
enjoyment
and
drinkability
will
definitely
have
to
buy
this
again
sometime
very
affordable
by
the
way
o
a
local
favorite
and
the
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
overall
perfection
perfect
balance
of
sweet
malt
with
nice
hop
bitterness
undertones
anchor
does
an
amazing
job
of
delivering
balanced
beers
this
is
a
must
try
all
in
all
a
great
beer
overall
i
was
quite
stunned
by
this
beer
a
very
refreshing
combination
of
sweet
malts
and
refreshing
hops
goes
well
with
itself
or
particularly
with
a
nice
dinner
what
surprised
me
the
most
was
the
price
i
expected
the
usual
premium
u
s
ale
price
of
au150
for
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
but
at
only
half
that
this
beer
is
not
only
a
gem
but
a
bargain
well
worth
it
a
great
food
beer
love
it
overall
i
give
a
4
and
a
half
one
of
my
favorite
ales
also
i
know
its
kind
of
superficial
but
the
bottle
shape
and
label
design
are
pretty
unique
and
aesthetically
wellconceived
overall
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
in
a
while
it
is
just
as
delicious
as
i
remember
has
a
brady
malt
aroma
pours
deep
amber
with
a
nice
beige
head
the
head
lasts
about
a
minute
with
moderate
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
is
brady
slightly
fruity
it
is
crisp
not
overly
carbonated
very
nice
should
be
even
better
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
found
this
beer
in
big
sur
for
the
first
time
and
enjoyed
it
at
the
river
inn
near
a
pretty
decent
river
i
loved
it
it
tasted
like
how
perfect
that
environment
sounds
look
it
up
if
you
dont
believe
me
its
worth
a
vacation
anyway
this
beer
is
rich
and
strong
its
a
powerful
beer
from
a
powerful
state
enjoy
this
would
be
a
good
summer
dock
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
a
few
for
the
cottage
however
outside
of
that
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
charge
the
bar
for
a
good
beer
but
not
great
o
im
a
local
and
have
been
drinking
and
enjoying
this
since
before
i
was
a
beer
snob
however
older
and
with
a
more
refined
palate
this
beer
is
only
slightly
above
average
for
me
not
saying
i
wont
enjoy
more
in
the
future
but
anchor
steam
im
sad
to
say
is
mediocre
anchors
other
beers
are
great
though
o
i
expected
a
simple
beer
and
got
one
it
reminds
me
of
a
cream
ale
with
a
slight
hoppiness
and
tartness
to
it
simple
but
decently
flavorful
not
bad
medium
copper
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
retains
well
theres
light
fruitiness
on
the
nose
with
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
minty
quality
from
the
northern
brewer
hops
overall
though
the
smell
is
rather
subdued
clean
sweet
malts
show
up
first
in
the
taste
followed
by
an
earthy
grassy
taste
and
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
no
floral
or
citrus
notes
are
imparted
by
the
hops
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
theres
little
carbonation
o
a
very
good
easy
to
drink
brew
i
may
be
guilty
of
over
looking
this
beer
for
a
long
time
any
beer
enthusiast
should
enjoy
anchor
steam
o
this
is
a
lovely
beer
its
an
awesome
and
unique
style
first
off
and
anchor
does
a
good
job
at
creating
a
balanced
flavor
will
try
again
soon
o
with
each
aspect
of
the
brew
it
just
got
better
and
better
to
behold
it
takes
me
back
to
one
of
the
first
craftmicrobrews
i
enjoyed
as
i
reformed
my
pale
american
adjunct
grain
lager
ways
after
all
of
those
years
i
have
come
to
realize
just
how
unique
and
special
this
brew
is
a
truly
classic
microbrew
and
one
of
the
originals
as
free
americans
rose
up
in
protest
to
the
swill
the
big
breweries
fooled
us
into
drinking
overall
what
is
there
to
say
about
this
that
hasnt
been
said
its
a
key
building
block
of
the
american
craft
brewing
scene
and
is
a
terrific
allpurpose
lager
overall
a
much
better
beer
than
i
remember
this
is
what
hoppy
bitterness
is
supposed
to
do
to
a
beers
taste
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
oglad
i
pulled
this
out
and
tried
it
this
was
different
and
i
like
this
style
o
an
interesting
hybrid
beer
with
attributes
from
lagers
in
smell
and
taste
but
with
a
fuller
body
and
a
nice
hop
presence
that
meakes
it
different
not
my
goto
beer
but
definitely
worth
repeating
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
ale
overall
a
good
brew
that
id
come
back
to
fairly
complex
for
what
i
expected
packs
some
nice
flavor
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
crack
open
this
craft
beer
staple
overall
solid
beer
nice
complexity
clearly
a
step
above
an
adjunct
lager
o
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
i
have
no
idea
when
i
would
drink
this
beer
were
i
to
have
again
it
is
quite
refreshing
but
there
are
certainly
more
refreshing
beers
around
its
sessionable
but
id
rather
session
a
beer
with
stronger
fruit
nut
or
malt
profiles
its
not
particularly
hoppy
which
is
fine
by
me
as
i
dont
enjoy
the
hops
but
if
i
did
like
hops
id
choose
an
ipa
its
relatively
inexpensive
but
if
i
really
want
to
get
after
it
there
are
cheaper
beers
with
higher
abvs
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
if
i
want
a
tasty
beer
im
going
to
have
some
variety
of
porter
stout
belgian
or
sour
it
is
wellbalanced
which
in
this
instance
is
somewhat
of
an
inadmirable
virtue
as
it
renders
a
neutral
beer
which
fails
to
offer
a
definitive
characteristic
required
to
compel
purchase
there
are
various
reasons
why
i
buy
beer
but
there
is
not
a
situation
i
can
think
of
where
another
beer
would
not
better
compliment
that
reason
o
anchor
steam
has
not
failed
to
deliver
on
any
of
their
beers
ive
had
so
far
and
this
is
no
exception
excellent
pairer
with
medium
to
lighter
fare
i
had
it
with
rice
and
chicken
just
fine
or
on
its
own
as
a
refreshing
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
good
little
beer
i
will
certainly
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
in
the
future
this
is
worth
a
trydont
judge
it
simply
because
of
its
availability
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
lightly
foamy
25
and
otherwise
smooth
35
body
thats
wellsuited
to
the
particular
beer
and
style
in
general
closes
dry
with
light
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
kimballs
pub
in
williamsport
pa
it
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
head
it
smelled
slightly
sweet
and
sour
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
like
dried
fruit
but
it
was
a
little
maltybitter
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
very
very
smooth
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
prost
o
lots
of
taste
lots
of
good
things
of
note
on
this
beer
the
only
thing
against
it
i
have
is
the
unremarkable
remembrance
of
this
beer
even
beers
that
suck
leave
me
remembering
their
suckiness
this
does
not
i
really
can
say
that
i
love
this
beer
but
it
is
not
remarkable
to
the
palate
to
the
level
that
i
have
become
accustomed
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
and
pick
up
a
case
of
this
but
would
be
ok
with
downing
a
few
from
time
to
time
4650
o
a
tasty
beer
and
much
more
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
from
this
style
overall
this
beer
is
a
major
disappointment
it
miss
the
mark
on
every
level
the
aroma
and
taste
only
gave
hints
of
roasted
malts
while
trying
to
infuse
a
hoppy
finish
this
brew
ended
up
being

was
at
least
5
or
6
years
ago
anyway
suprised
to
find
myself
enjoying
now
the
second
time
around
o
i
guess
i
am
seeing
the
bros
rate
it
so
highly
due
to
the
respect
it
deserves
for
longevity
in
the
brewing
industry
and
the
true
to
style
characteristics
based
on
the
fact
that
anchor
brewing
actually
created
the
style
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
in
general
if
you
like
this
style
this
beer
pretty
much
defines
it
while
i
tend
to
gravitate
to
stronger
more
robust
modern
styles
i
can
see
however
where
150
years
ago
brewing
this
kind
of
beer
was
a
most
awesome
achievement
go
anchor
find
it
drink
it
love
it
o
the
granddaddy
of
craft
does
not
disappoint
poured
from
the
stubby
22
into
glass
it
created
a
light
tan
1finger
head
a
little
darker
head
and
color
than
i
remembered
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
one
the
creamy
head
lingers
nicely
and
leaves
very
decent
lace
i
honestly
didnt
pick
up
much
on
the
aroma
slight
hops
the
beer
is
very
dry
skews
malty
but
leaves
a
pronounced
bitterness
clean
finish
it
is
busy
in
the
mouth
and
appears
very
lively
in
the
glass
with
its
active
carbonation
the
metallic
note
is
offputting
and
i
know
the
esters
are
a
byproduct
of
fermenting
lager
yeast
at
ale
temperatures
but
its
still
a
weird
combo
great
malt
backbone
and
fairly
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
distinct
brew
tastes
like
a
classic
with
good
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
would
suggest
this
as
a
nice
beer
to
try
if
you
want
some
hops
but
dont
want
to
go
all
crazy
with
an
american
ipa
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
it
outstanding
solid
and
tasty
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
an
amber
body
with
excellent
clarity
nose
to
the
bottle
smells
like
grain
husk
cereal
a
slightly
medicinal
rubbingalcohol
scent
detected
taste
is
extremely
clean
caramel
and
toasted
grains
up
front
with
a
slightly
herbal
bitterness
at
the
end
highly
carbonated
with
a
medium
thin
mouthfeel
well
balanced
tasty
and
extremely
satisfying
overall
a
great
lager
i
would
have
no
problem
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
when
i
come
across
it
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
overall
my
first
steam
beer
so
nothing
really
to
compare
it
too
although
compared
to
other
lagers
it
is
a
very
natural
feeling
beer
not
too
many
crazy
flavors
just
a
good
clean
well
crafted
lager
this
beer
is
a
testament
to
anchors
dedication
to
quality
its
archetypal
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
or
bells
amber
ale
few
beers
are
as
good
and
even
fewer
are
better
if
youre
looking
for
a
gateway
to
craft
beer
this
is
it
overall
this
one
caught
me
completely
off
guard
i
was
expecting
a
lager
and
got
something
more
similar
to
a
fruit
beer
and
a
pretty
good
one
too
hot
summer
days
beg
for
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
definitely
sessionable
really
stood
out
from
the
crowd
of
american
lagers
during
its
time
but
now
is
relatively
nondistinct
peace
very
good
and
drinkable
beer
great
session
beer
while
i
prefer
anchors
liberty
ale
and
their
porter
this
is
still
a
very
good
example
of
an
interesting
historical
aberration
i
am
not
a
lager
person
in
general
and
so
its
not
entirely
fair
for
me
to
review
this
beer
but
oh
well
the
beer
has
excellent
dark
amber
color
and
has
an
excellent
aroma
it
is
a
somewhat
thick
lager
so
the
mouth
feel
wasnt
what
i
expected
i
really
dont
like
wheat
beers
and
the
taste
again
its
a
lager
so
maybe
its
not
ideal
that
i
delve
into
this
was
very
wheatlike
the
beer
starts
off
decent
but
through
the
heavy
mouthfeel
and
thick
grain
taste
i
normally
call
it
good
after
one
most
anyone
else
reviewing
this
beer
raved
about
it
so
its
probably
just
me
but
this
isnt
a
go
to
beer
for
me
but
ill
drink
it
if
its
this
or
commercial
beers
available
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
a
nice
off
white
head
developed
with
mild
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
clear
with
a
golden
orange
color
nice
fruity
aroma
with
spice
notes
tasted
hoppy
and
light
up
front
with
floral
and
fruity
notes
light
caramel
on
the
back
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
light
dry
aftertaste
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
usually
one
for
lagers
but
ill
give
everything
a
shot
would
get
again
if
the
mood
struck
me
o
classic
beer
okay
but
i
dont
consider
it
a
treat
oim
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
this
classic
it
is
lighter
and
more
quaffable
than
i
remember
but
a
a
great
example
of
this
style
nonetheless
at
times
it
reminded
me
of
an
english
mild
and
other
times
of
a
german
pilsner
the
whole
package
is
a
bit
rustic
but
the
easy
drinking
nature
of
this
brew
would
make
a
great
sessionfootball
watching
beer
pours
into
tulip
from
bottle
a
beautiful
clear
copper
with
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
mild
malt
pears
some
florals
flavor
is
admittedly
mild
but
definitely
session
able
medium
light
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
sweet
malts
and
light
fruits
with
a
slightly
unpleasant
finish
finally
tried
this
and
it
is
not
too
bad
better
sessionable
brews
though
overall
a
nice
dry
tasting
steam
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
go
too
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
overall
good
beer
for
watching
a
ballgame
with
lots
of
hop
and
malt
character
best
with
strong
flavor
foods
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
small
quickly
receding
head
soon
left
after
the
pour
initial
smell
is
complex
but
the
combination
of
hops
and
floral
tones
makes
it
pleasant
the
taste
is
sharp
but
i
think
it
lacks
a
full
flavor
it
is
still
very
good
though
a
very
sessionable
beer
as
the
palate
is
clean
after
drinking
a
historic
brew
and
certainly
worth
the
try
o
this
was
enjoyable
reminded
me
of
yuengling
but
with
a
very
british
flavor
has
a
very
bright
crisp
and
refreshing
flavor
profile
great
refreshing
beer
simple
and
straightforward
but
still
very
interesting
i
also
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
didnt
notice
any
differences
it
definately
has
a
signature
taste
there
is
also
a
light
lager
version
that
i
tried
and
its
probably
what
i
would
switch
to
when
im
ready
to
keep
drinking
very
enjoyable
overall
maybe
not
enough
here
to
be
a
destination
beer
but
a
great
companion
to
a
meal
or
for
an
afternoon
break
from
the
golf
course
etc
i
forgot
how
good
this
beer
is
great
way
to
end
the
summer
and
bring
in
the
fall
this
is
an
ale
with
a
touch
of
lager
behind
it
overall
for
the
style
it
is
a
great
beer
maybe
should
hit
all
fours
easy
drinking
and
favorable
not
something
i
would
consume
normally
but
would
be
a
good
session
brew
overall
delicious
an
american
classic
that
is
a
hybrid
between
an
ale
and
lager
the
unique
brewing
process
which
is
worth
looking
up
for
those
who
dont
know
what
a
steam
beer
is
gives
the
pleasing
versatility
of
this
beer
the
northern
brewer
hops
mix
perfectly
to
give
the
woodsy
minty
and
overall
rustic
hop
flavor
a
must
try
that
can
easily
become
an
old
standby
especially
for
cool
fall
nights
o
i
think
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
due
to
the
lightness
of
it
all
around
it
tastes
great
and
is
an
excellent
beer
to
sit
and
relax
with
a
true
classic
i
have
had
this
one
many
times
and
find
it
to
be
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
with
more
character
than
a
macro
lager
and
enough
complexity
to
keep
things
from
getting
too
dull
over
the
course
of
a
session
pours
a
deep
amber
on
the
srm
scale
and
leaves
a
nice
rich
foam
if
you
pour
the
beer
correctly
although
with
this
one
i
often
dispense
with
the
glass
aroma
is
a
sweet
and
spicy
combo
of
bready
spicy
yeast
and
herbal
notes
with
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
where
the
magic
is
sourdough
yeast
cleansing
spice
like
white
pepper
some
banana
and
vanilla
esters
a
nice
sour
tang
with
a
decent
biscuity
crystal
malt
lingering
sweetness
on
the
palate
drinkable
but
not
dull
might
underwhelm
those
who
love
hop
bombs
as
the
northern
brewer
are
there
to
provide
grassiness
and
a
bitter
foil
rather
than
complex
hop
aroma
but
keep
an
open
mind
there
is
enough
ale
character
in
this
hybrid
style
to
keep
one
engaged
this
true
classic
is
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
and
quite
reasonable
priced
as
well
o
great
beer
and
uniquely
its
own
would
be
great
with
some
grilled
chicken
or
other
light
bbq
food
initially
it
seemed
not
to
be
a
big
deal
but
then
it
kind
of
grew
on
me
for
its
unique
taste
though
it
resembles
some
british
bitters
i
could
have
drunk
a
few
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
it
a
try
i
round
it
up
given
its
historic
twist
anchor
steam
pours
a
darker
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
weak
aroma
but
has
bitter
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
and
has
long
drawn
out
floral
notes
a
bit
watery
but
nice
flavors
easy
to
drink
overall
a
solid
beer
723
revisited
have
a
new
appreciation
for
this
brew
great
creamy
biscuit
nutty
malt
flavors
crisp
and
refreshing
i
will
be
purchasing
more
of
this
beer
its
light
enough
for
the
summer
and
tasty
enough
for
the
winter
as
good
a
lager
as
ive
run
across
in
the
5
0
abv
and
under
world
this
beer
has
a
classic
and
clean
taste
that
is
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
the
hops
are
soft
yet
bitter
and
drinks
like
a
lazy
afternoon
friendly
and
approachable
would
pair
well
with
black
bean
burgers
and
would
compliment
a
variety
of
vegetarian
dishes
would
also
go
well
with
spicy
foods
like
chili
or
sweetly
smoky
foods
like
barbecue
its
versatile
overall
solid
beer
ive
been
drinking
anchors
products
for
years
but
i
havent
reviewed
many
of
them
drinkability
i
have
had
this
beer
so
much
but
never
reviewed
it
until
now
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
great
session
beer
overall
more
flavorful
than
a
lager
yet
more
simple
than
a
typical
ale
its
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
that
sparks
any
real
interest
for
me
i
cant
think
of
a
specific
season
or
situation
where
something
different
would
be
more
appropriate
or
satisfying
just
know
this
anchor
steam
is
a
true
american
classic
its
everything
anchor
intended
it
to
be
and
anyone
that
appreciates
good
beer
should
have
one
every
once
in
a
while
to
remind
themselves
of
where
the
movement
began
i
know
this
isnt
literally
the
first
craft
beer
just
one
of
the
progenitors
it
comes
across
as
damning
with
faint
praise
i
know
but
there
you
are
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
to
my
mind
rather
overhyped
and
overpriced
to
be
honest
what
it
really
is
when
all
is
said
and
done
is
a
solid
session
beer
not
that
far
removed
from
boston
lager
folk
whove
drank
a
lot
of
sam
adams
and
have
never
tried
this
really
should
theyd
probably
like
it
a

a
beer
that
i
okay
not
good
or
bad
best
before
date
unreadable
on
label
tried
this
beer
at
lombards
restaurant
at
universal
studios
florida
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
to
enjoy
a
good
microbrew
at
the
theme
park
great
taste
with
no
bitterness
paired
it
with
the
turkey
burger
and
calamari
appetizer
i
will
have
to
find
this
one
again
o
a
good
beer
to
try
once
for
the
hell
of
it
i
guess
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
session
beer
either
since
the
mouthfeel
tends
to
subdue
some
of
the
bitterness
i
poured
this
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
it
looked
very
enticing
with
a
big
head
and
a
lot
of
bright
orange
bubbling
action
the
smell
was
a
little
citrusy
and
a
hint
of
pepper
but
the
taste
reminded
me
of
eating
soap
as
did
the
mouthfeel
maybe
im
just
not
a
steam
beer
kinda
guy
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
didnt
like
this
beer
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
poured
into
imperial
pokal
golden
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
collapses
to
a
thick
layer
of
foam
and
then
sits
smells
a
bit
soapy
crackery
and
malty
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
crackery
buttery
malts
and
a
slight
hop
twang
to
snip
off
the
aftertaste
a
delicious
session
beer
this
would
be
great
with
a
picnic
or
after
doing
yardwork
in
the
hot
sun
on
tap
at
comstock
saloon
in
north
beach
ive
had
it
in
the
bottle
in
san
francisco
as
well
and
i
just
find
this
to
be
uninspired
and
not
very
drinkable
regardless
of
its
glorious
history
it
was
more
respected
in
the
70s
when
there
were
so
few
interesting
beers
to
compare
it
to
appearance
is
amber
but
who
really
cares
about
the
color
of
the
beer
so
much
when
men
cant
differentiate
between
colors
very
well
my
apologies
to
the
women
the
smell
is
impressive
though
its
nutty
caramel
and
has
notes
of
ripe
banana
esters
the
taste
has
notes
of
vanilla
and
some
nutty
tones
but
it
is
balanced
by
a
hop
finish
balanced
and
appetizing
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
medium
full
overall
this
beer
is
a
high
quality
low
alcohol
beer
and
is
great
for
people
who
love
their
malty
taste
and
low
alcohol
percentage
it
seems
to
catch
up
to
all
of
us
in
the
end
onice
crisp
session
beer
for
warm
summer
days
o
very
subtle
but
not
very
exciting
i
have
a
feeling
i
should
be
enjoying
this
beer
more
than
i
am
because
of
its
history
but
then
again
the
bavarian
purity
law
is
also
a
part
of
history
and
many
unexciting
beers
as
well
mouthfeel
it
has
a
strong
body
it
kinda
felt
heavy
in
my
mouth
at
the
end
of
the
sip
it
was
a
little
bit
dry
the
color
is
very
rich
a
copper
color
this
beer
retains
the
head
very
well
a
nice
earthy
smell
the
slight
piney
smell
certainly
comes
through
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
drink
with
just
a
hint
of
aftertaste
i
can
see
this
being
a
sit
around
and
drink
a
few
with
friends
kind
of
beer
the
color
is
light
cooper
with
a
slight
offwhite
bubbly
neck
that
retains
well
the
body
is
clear
and
emanates
caramel
very
strongly
as
well
as
earthy
and
piney
tones
the
light
body
brings
carameltoast
nodes
with
apparent
hops
you
can
notice
a
discrete
fruitness
in
the
background
mango
bananas
the
finish
is
strong
exposing
so
well
the
hops
its
a
good
lager
with
a
more
malty
profile
and
a
slight
background
fruitness
great
beer
i
like
it
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beer
easy
drinker
relaxed
mild
and
highly
quaffable
nothing
tremendous
in
terms
of
flavor
or
aroma
but
then
again
nothing
offputting
or
offensive
either
i
respect
the
originality
of
the
style
but
i
think
i
prefer
steamy
windows
from
liberty
street
over
this
one
despite
its
history
as
the
precedentsetter
o
solid
beer
that
really
embodies
what
a
pilsner
should
be
i
would
say
with
this
beer
there
is
nothing
new
about
it
they
set
out
to
make
a
really
solid
beer
and
they
did
just
that
drinkability
well
this
was
my
first
california
common
and
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
overall
i
think
that
it
is
a
nice
drop
one
that
would
go
with
a
lot
of
different
styles
of
cuisine
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
to
savour
on
its
own
merits
summary
anchor
steam
is
really
a
great
beer
its
hard
to
explain
but
it
is
just
so
smooth
and
balanced
and
drinkable
there
is
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
sweetness
possibly
one
of
my
favorites
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
from
the
bottle
on
4513
the
color
is
a
nice
bronzed
amber
color
with
deep
orange
hues
to
it
it
has
a
very
active
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
and
promises
to
be
pretty
active
on
the
tongue
ive
recently
become
a
fan
of
the
northern
brewer
hops
and
they
definitely
work
well
on
the
nose
of
this
beer
the
beer
is
very
much
full
on
malt
and
caramel
with
that
distinctive
lager
yeast
smell
of
fresh
baked
bread
the
northern
brewer
hops
play
well
to
the
background
with
good
woodsy
and
minty
smell
to
the
background
the
taste
is
fairly
mild
but
like
expected
very
active
its
a
good
malt
and
caramel
backbone
with
that
great
scrubbing
of
the
northern
brewer
hops
giving
that
woodsy
taste
and
a
touch
of
lemon
rind
maybe
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
bodied
and
again
very
active
carbonation
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
very
good
overall
without
much
surprise
it
is
the
standard
in
my
mind
of
a
steam
beer
i
refuse
to
use
california
common
lol
the
verdict
not
bad
i
know
its
highly
regarded
by
many
but
its
a
bit
too
mild
for
my
taste
i
did
enjoy
it
but
not
enough
to
go
looking
for
it
o
unique
as
a
lagerale
truly
craft
enjoyable
very
time
not
sold
on
this
at
all
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
refreshing
but
no
wow
factors
i
liked
the
beer
but
i
think
that
there
are
way
too
many
other
beers
out
there
that
are
much
more
interesting
an
original
american
lager
one
that
will
be
always
be
pretty
tasty
personal
rate
3
5
o
highly
recommended
definitely
a
great
find
if
you
can
catch
it
on
tap
overall
a
good
thirstquencher
tastes
much
like
a
pilsner
and
seems
wellmade
set
me
free
would
not
exactly
be
my
beer
of
choice
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
at
all
and
its
a
solid
craft
beer
but
its
a
very
respectable
beer
with
a
lot
of
history
behind
it
poured
from
a
bottle
o
this
is
a
nice
tasty
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
its
the
example
that
all
other
members
of
this
style
are
based
on
nothing
more
needs
to
be
said
so
pair
this
on
a
hot
day
with
some
nice
traditional
jazz
music
i
might
suggest
a
cd
by
bucky
pizzarelli
called
challis
in
wonderland
where
this
guitar
phenom
sits
in
with
some
wonderful
arrangement
with
a
small
string
section
performing
some
old
great
jazz
pieces
arranged
by
challis
who
worked
with
bix
beiderbecke
another
wise
choice
might
be
hampton
hawes
trio
music
o
overall
what
the
hell
why
is
their
so
much
praise
for
this
beer
perhaps
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
it
tasted
like
a
slightly
smoked
corona
d
an
all
around
superb
beer
and
a
true
testament
to
the
uncompromising
quality
of
craft
breweries
even
ones
as
big
as
anchor
a
balanced
tasty
and
incredibly
drinkable
ale
a
true
classic
o
pretty
good
similar
to
a
light
lager
ale
nothing
too
notable
about
this
beer
abv

overall
this
is
the
first
micro
brew
i
remember
being
aware
of
as
a
young
boy
i
watched
my
father
drink
one
at
fishermans
wharf
yes
im
a
little
biased
i
love
this
beer
has
a
nice
thick
chew
but
it
is
very
palatable
and
swallows
like
a
light
beer
i
was
surprised
by
the
refreshing
feeling
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
pours
a
golden
brown
with
slight
head
that
dissipates
quick
leaving
slight
white
lacing
a
bit
macro
smelling
at
first
but
changes
to
a
nice
caramel
aroma
as
it
warms
nice
caramel
malty
flavor
perfectly
balanced
with
hops
so
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
brew
and
obviously
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
o
solid
beer
nothing
that
stands
too
far
out
but
its
a
classic
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
wellrounded
beer
by
anchor
o
not
worldclass
but
my
entrypoint
into
steam
beers
not
bad
at
all
solid
beer
holds
up
well
in
spite
of
its
classic
and
potentially
outdated
status
this
is
a
unique
one
easy
to
drink
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
big
white
fluffy
head
fairly
malty
and
sweet
aroma
very
flavorful
beer
interesting
notes
of
sweet
salt
bitter
fruity
and
a
little
citrus
good
body
with
a
big
punch
of
carbonation
great
balance
and
a
beer
i
think
anybody
could
like
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
and
am
glad
i
did
looking
forward
to
trying
other
beers
from
this
brewery
overall
a
fantastic
session
beer
goes
down
smooth
not
heavy
but
with
a
lot
of
flavor
very
satisfying
overall
3
5
it
taste
good
however
it
does
seem
to
be
lacking
a
bit
will
be
interested
in
trying
this
again
overall
this
is
a
beer
with
ok
flavors
but
a
great
feel
its
a
fairly
simple
beer
best
used
as
an
after
work
beer
if
i
had
better
access
to
this
and
the
price
was
right
this
would
be
a
goto
beer
in
my
fridge
for
an
everyday
alternative
owow
this
beer
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
had
never
thought
this
style
sounded
very
appealing
but
it
was
a
wonderful
session
beer
love
the
minty
northern
brewer
hop
character
smooth
flavorful
and
balanced
a
beautiful
copper
brew
with
pillowy
head
and
great
retention
hopaccented
think
flowers
and
mint
aroma
with
a
biscuit
and
caramel
backbone
some
highalcohol
notes
are
noticeable
both
in
the
nose
and
tongue
with
the
former
having
a
more
dominating
dried
leaves
and
grain
husk
flavors
with
a
bubblegum
center
angular
and
spritzy
on
the
tongue
the
brew
quickly
placates
to
an
almost
uncarbonated
soapy
medium
bodied
brew
with
assertive
bitterness
poured
into
an
ale
glass
yeah
yeah
yeah
it
was
sitting
at
my
desk
already
developed
a
rich
amber
color
very
clear
very
small
head
nose
is
nice
rye
fruit
though
hard
to
say
what
maybe
peach
and
lemon
a
little
fresh
oregano
and
yeast
taste
is
fresh
and
bright
citrus
notes
without
the
hop
explosion
that
ive
come
to
associate
with
it
finish
is
zesty
with
lemon
grass
and
fresh
herbs
riding
it
out
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
matched
to
the
taste
light
spritzy
and
bitter
the
flavor
and
feel
race
across
your
tongue
and
disappear
enticing
you
to
sip
again
overall
a
well
put
together
beer
and
american
styles
are
not
usually

i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
flavor
came
in
a
bottle
poured
it
ınto
a
glass
good
color
it
was
my
first
west
coast
beer
had
it
a
while
ago
while
visiting
in
sf
wish
i
could
remember
more
i
really
liked
the
bottle
i
thought
it
was
fun
and
creative
had
it
in
a
pub
somewhere
in
ghiradelli
square
bottle
pretty
darkish
cobber
amber
with
a
medium
creamy
off
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
in
the
liquid
aroma
is
malty
some
barn
and
rye
bread
wonderful
spritzy
carbonation
with
lots
of
small
bubbles
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malty
with
a
slight
peppery
bitterness
nice
and
fresh
wonderful
summer
beer
fritz
maytags
purchase
and
subsequent
revival
of
anchor
brewing
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
start
of
modern
craft
beer
ive
been
meaning
to
review
this
for
a
while
its
more
than
just
a
historical
artifact
its
a
solid
beer
o
well
not
much
to
say
here
the
original
steam
beer
a
smooth
easygoing
lager
with
good
flavors
and
good
drinkability
a
classic
for
sure
o
a
unique
and
refreshing
brew
with
wonderful
flavors
and
high
drinkability
a
great
brew
for
a
sunny
day
one
of
my
go
to
session
beers
which
pairs
well
with
summer
bbq
this
is
not
a
typical
lager
but
its
a
very
beery
tasting
beer
unique
in
its
simplicity
great
session
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
dry
thats
not
a
hopmonster
o
nice
flavor
and
a
great
session
beer
nothing
fancy
but
decently
priced
probably
a
great
party
brew
o
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
put
off
trying
for
far
too
long
not
overly
complex
but
nicely
balanced
and
uniquely
interesting
o
quite
enjoyable
classic
style
pours
a
light
copper
with
half
a
finger
of
head
the
nose
is
distinctly
caramelized
malt
notes
malty
but
it
also
has
a
dry
white
wine
bitterness
to
it
dry
and
mildly
hoppy
on
the
finish
the
quintessential
version
of
a
truly
unique
american
style
overall
i
bought
a
couple
of
these
from
the
store
to
enjoy
after
work
it
feels
good
to
have
a
lighter
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
early
fall
months
this
is
an
above
average
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
english
bitters
then
this
brew
is
for
you
o
low
abv
highly
drinkable
and
perhaps
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
or
should
i
say
steam
beer
that
i
move
towards
nothing
to
blow
anyones
socks
off
but
for
one
looking
for
a
well
put
together
upperend
brew
this
is
it
interesting
enough
style
not
my
favorite
though
o
solid
beer
great
for
any
occasion
cheers
anchor
steam
beer
the
bottle
says
anchor
steam
brand
beer
is
virtually
handmade
with
an
exceptional
respect
for
the
ancient
art
of
brewing
the
deep
amber
color
thick
creamy
head
and
the
rich
flavor
all
testify
to
our
traditional
brewing
methods
anchor
steam
beer
derives
its
unusual
name
from
the
19th
century
when
steam
seems
to
have
been
a
nickname
for
beer
brewed
on
the
west
coast
of
american
under
primitive
conditions
and
without
ice
the
word
steam
may
have
referred
to
the
pressure
of
nature
carbonation
developing
in
the
beers
today
the
brewing
methods
of
those
days
are
a
mystery
and
for
many
decades
anchor
alone
has
used
the
quaint
name
steam
for
its
unique
beer
today
anchor
is
one
of
the
smallest
and
most
traditional
breweries
in
the
world
san
franciscos
famous
anchor
steam
brand
beer
is
unique
for
our
brewing
process
has
evolved
over
many
decades
and
is
like
no
other
in
the
world
the
brew
poured
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
body
is
a
clear
amber
color
with
mild
visible
carbonation
the
nose
is
really
muted
and
i
mean
muted
to
the
point
that
i
was
sticking
my
face
in
the
glass
and
couldnt
get
much
i
was
really
searching
and
got
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
boring
at
best
there
was
a
crispness
to
it
which
was
the
good
part
otherwise
i
got
some
malt
on
it
with
a
hint
of
hops
wow
this
is
just
bland
it
goes
down
easily
but
i
think
my
qualm
is
more
with
the
style
its
just
very
boring
to
me
i
could
easily
put
a
few
back
but
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
finish
is
quick
and
unremarkable
this
one
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
its
an
ok
beer
though
not
amazing
from
the
stale
background
notes
im
wondering
if
this
is
old
though
its
well
within
date
decent
malt
character
with
an
unusual
yeast
presence
like
an
english
ale
no
aromatic
hops
to
be
discerned
goes
down
easily
enough
but
just
isnt
that
interesting
i
wanted
to
like
this
more
perhaps
ill
have
another
fresher
one
some
time
anchor
steam
beer
a
dark
honey
color
beer
with
a
good
head
lots
of
malt
throughout
and
tempered
by
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
wet
and
dry
at
the
same
time
the
finish
is
definitely
unique
worth
a
try
if
you
have
never
sampled
a
steam
beer
better
than
most
beers
you
find
on
tap
at
your
average
well
still
i
was
not
wowed
enough
to
make
it
part
of
my
standard
favorite
rotation
beers
o
a
crisp
and
refreshing
somewhat
hoppy
beer
with
a
nice
bit
of
fruity
ester
complexity
o
i
seem
to
remeber
this
as
a
much
more
flavorful
hoppy
beer
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
average
beer
but
i
appreciate
the
backstory
of
steam
beerscalifornia
common
beers
o
to
me
this
is
a
very
average
beer
but
i
appreciate
the
backstory
of
steam
beerscalifornia
common
beers
mostly
full
bodied
lightly
effervescent
with
a
faint
dryness
to
it
drinks
so
much
like
my
perception
of
an
english
pale
ale
with
a
lessened
hop
note
good
all
around
the
rest
a
true
classic
great
balance
some
subtle
complexity
and
great
drinkability
make
this
an
excellent
beer
o
really
pleasant
clean
quality
beer
its
good
for
the
summertime
love
the
way
it
has
two
distinct
taste
intervals
o
easy
drinker
that
still
satisfies
the
palate
my
first
foray
into
the
style
so
im
not
sure
if
im
undervaluing
it
but
im
not
particularly
impressed
its
not
especially
tasty
or
refreshing

anything

its

beer
but
it
does
everything
right
its
somehow
quite
sugary
in

yet
the
hops
gives
it
a
nice
light
bitter
kick
its
just
a
joy
to
drink
and
not
one
to
over
think
its
got
a
nice
grainy
smell
a
powerful
hop
bitterness
up
front
that
mellows
out
with
excellent
malts
and
a
mild
fruitiness
thats
the
simplest
way
of
explaining
it
but
really
you
wont
have
any
idea
what
to
expect
its
a
beer
in
a
league
of
its
own
maybe
its
not
for
everyone
but
everyone
needs
to
try
it
quite
a
nice
full
drinking
beer
which
shows
a
good
complexity
and
flavour
overall
this
is
always
a
nice
easy
drinker
not
too
complex
but
quite
good
overall
great
beer
but
tastes
like
an
ale
this
isnt
the
old
anchor
steam
recently
the
brewers
have
added
alot
more
color
to
this
beer
along
with
more
hops
the
old
anchor
was
much
ligher
in
color
with
a
lower
hop
level
and
a
yeasty
character
is
it
better
im
not
so
sure
this
beer
kind
of
tastes
like
a
hopped
up
amber
ale
without
that
character
i
like
the
older
anchor
final
thoughts
this
actually
tastes
like
a
hoppier
version
of
the
first
home
brew
i
ever
made
cream
ale
which
makes
it
sort
of
unimpressive
however
it
is
a
very
cool
hybrid
of
the
ale
and
lager
worlds
and
you
can
definitely
taste
both
elements
in
here
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
copper
with
a
tall
biege
head
that
dissipates
slowly
some
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
barley
malt
and
some
hops
there
is
a
nice
malty
component
to
this
beer
in
the
taste
there
is
sweet
up
front
with
breadiness
hitting
at
the
middle
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
with
some
aftertaste
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
have
to
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
that
this
beer
does
remind
me
of
an
esb
really
a
new
experience
for
me
it
really
does
skirt
the
line
between
lager
and
west
coast
style
ale
leaning
more
toward
the
lager
profile
both
flavor
wise
and
smell
wise
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
its
very
reminiscent
of
fullers
esb
try
it
with
fish
and
chips
excess
carbonation
is
good
at
cutting
through
oils
and
fats
o
very
flavorful
an
excellent
session
beer
with
a
fine
balanced
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
i
like
this
beer
alot
and
i
think
on
further
tastings
i
may
pick
up
other
subtleties
would
love
this
to
be
more
easily
available
in
the
uk
lovely
stuff
rich
caramel
balances
a
slightly
unruly
herbal
hop
flavor
further
warming
brings
out
some
sourdough
bread
crust
black
pepper
and
leafiness
a
hint
of
fruit
and
yeastiness
adds
depth
great
full
mouthfeel
especially
considering
the
sub5
abv
an
original
american
style
and
anchor
steam
pretty
much
defines
it
what
more
do
you
want
odhow
have
i
not
rated
this
before
i
am
sure
i
have
had
it
before
but
it
slipped
through
the
cracks
i
truly
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
the
big
daddy
of
common
beers
it
still
isnt
my
thing
o
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
one
well
balanced
and
lives
up
to
the
hype
poured
from
the
bottle
this
is
what
beer
looks
like
its
glowing
amber
color
and
thick
foamy
head
provide
a
backdrop
for
a
soothing
upward
cascade
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
malty
but
crisp
aroma
presents
a
nice
combination
of
bready
sweetness
and
mossy
bitterness
the
flavor
likewise
exhibits
good
depth
while
still
being
quite
drinkable
the
must
hop
profile
is
more
pronounced
over
the
malty
base
and
there
is
some
tangy
yeastiness
to
add
further
complexity
the
beer
is
substantial
on
the
tongue
but
smooth
which
once
again
makes
this
one
flavorful
yet
drinkable
overall
there
isnt
anything
here
that
isnt
normally
found
in
other
beers
but
this
has
some
kind
of
character
that
makes
it
stand
out
pours
a
crystal
clear
ambercopper
with
a
tightly
knit
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
the
inside
of
the
glass
a
ton
of
love
smell
is
very
lageresque
grainy
but
simultaneously
complex
and
very
much
inviting
taste
is
refreshingly
hoppy
but
not
overbearing
and
of
lightly
toasted
malt
feel
is
refreshingly
crisp
but
overall
comes
off
a
bit
thin
however
definitely
something
to
enjoy
in
sequence
overall
a
great
brew
got
into
the
whole
steam
scene
while
on
a
trip
to
the
bay
area
and
this
certainly
exemplifies
it

i
found
it
somewhat
unique
though
forgettable
for
me
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
simple
beer
thats
full
of
flavor
with
high
drinkability
sometimes
i
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
just
malt
and
hops
and
this
is
as
good
as
any
for
that
balanced
and
delicious
mouthfeel
lighter

pricking
and
very

that

this

id
actually
see
myself
buying
on
purpose
occasionally
o
this
is
my
second
time
drinking
this
one
but
my
first
review
i
think
i
like
it
a
lot
more
a
second
time
must
try
overall
this
a
true
classic
i
think
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
often
gets
over
looked
and
is
under
appreciated
especially
in
our
culture
of
bigger
and
bolder
beers
it
is
truly
a
great
beer
and
every
time
i
drink
it
i
feel
privileged
to
be
able
to
drink
such
a
masterpiece
to
me
its
nearly
a
perfect
beer
overall
a
real
good
session
beer
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
brew
and
its
sessionable
qualities
will
certainly
continue
to
buy
never
had
another

definitely
one
i
will
go
back
to
i
havent
had
one
of
these
in
a
long
time
and
was
interested
to
see
how
i
like
it
after
drinking
so
many
hoppedup
american
ipas
recently
i
still
like
it
but
it
is
far
more
drinkable
than
i
remember
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
or
a
good
intro
to
craft
for
uninitiated
beer
lovers
its
a
classic
american
beer
honestly
i
felt
that
while
this
beer
was
good
it
lacked
any
defining
characteristics
the
nose
is
kind
of
flat
but
the
malt
and
hop
balance
is
spot
on
not
to
bitter
not
to
malty
or
sweet
this
is
a
good
session
beer
because
it
does
not
leave
any
lingering
taste
but
at
the
same
time
i
feel
that
its
constitution
is
fairly
week
not
bad
but
not
great
pretty
middle
of
the
road
this
is
a
decent
beer
a
classic
for
sure
it
has
great
drinkability
its
smooth
and
has
a
refreshing
flavor
it
being
a
classic
ill
probably
be
back
to
it
as
some
time
o
delicious
and
perfect
for
springsummer
wish
it
were
as
affordable
as
many
of
the
other
micros
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
but
the
flavor
profile
just
aint
my
thing
o
one
of
my
new
favorite
session
beers
such
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
all
of
these
cookie
cutter
apas
dont
think
i
will
revisit
this
one
o
solid
beer
great
for
hops
lovers
who
are
looking
for
a
lower
alcohol
refreshing
summer
brew
for
those
swamp
ass
days
of
summer
this
is
always
a
solid
pick
tangy
yeast
and
a
sturdy
grain
malt
with
plenty
of
balancing
hops
its
like
an
american
style
pub
bitter
pours
a
copper
color
with
an
egg
shell
head
and
good
retention
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
taste
clearly
shows
the
roasted
malts
along
with
some
bitterness
at
the
end
making
is
nicely
balanced
finishes
clean
and
crisp
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
here
who
smelled
straight
up
banana
on
the
nose
of
this
one
this
was
while
the
head
was
still
foaming
but
it
was
pretty
prevalent
otherwise
i
had
trouble
getting
anything
out
of
this
beer
its
not
really
something
i
would
want
again
but
i
feel
like
i
need
to
try
again
and
parse
out
more
flavors
othis
is
a
nice
beer
definitely
a
lager
much
better
than
any
mass
produced
beer
would
love
to
sip
on
this
on
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
with
a
nice
simple
character
to
it
doa
o
the
microbrew
industry
has
exploded
in
the
past
15
years
and
yet
this
consistently
grabs
my
attention
more
than
anything
else
on
the
market
so
easy
so
flavorful
so
drinkable
ive
drank
this
beer
on
the
beach
and
paired
it
with
christmas
cuisine
not
many
beers
can
stand
up
to
the
task
of
being
so
delicious
and
so
multi
faceted
love
this
stuff
overall
very
drinkable
one
of
the
less
common
genres
out
there
and
this
one
sets
the
bar
for
it
hazy

with
two
fingers
of
rocky
white
head
that
displays
great
staying

great

that
perfect
bite

the
end
mouthfeel
is

with
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
few
lagers
i
could
go
for
time
and
time
again
o
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
some
interesting
qualities
overall
a
solid
beer
but
it
seemed
a
little
thin
and
lacking
in
flavor
i
have
had
this
on
tap
before
and
it
was
better
might
have
to
revisit
this
sometime
o
an
american
classic
that
is
worthy
of
its
praise
o
this
was
an
old
standby
for
me
back
in
the
late
90s
and
this
was
my
first
revisitation
in
a
long
time
honestly
its
still
a
really
solid
drink
im
not
sure
it
compares
well
to
the
best
beers
around
now
but
i
gotta
give
a
thumbs
up
to
history
overall
this
is
a
classic
brew
an
important
part
of
american
craft
beer
history
and
a
great
session
beer
its
very
smooth
and
follows
just
like
the
aroma
its
dry
in
a
sense
and
makes
you
want
to
keep
sipping
just
like
all
of
their
beers
id
buy
this
all
the
time
a
session

theres
nothing
in

department
that
draws
me
in
the
incredible
rep
that
preceded

a
mystery
to
me
and
i

that
i
could
pick
this
out
of
a
ineup
of
generic
session
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
singular
carbonation
is
heavier
than
expected
and
likely
keeps
the
beer
from
bogging
down

i
bet
it
would
be
much
heavier
if
the
carbonation
were

that
anyone
can
enjoy
whether
its
the

enthusiast
or
the
casual
yard
beer
drinker
its

in

it
tastes
good
enough
that
it
can
please
just
about
anyone
pours
amber
with
nice

retention
subtleness
of

o
a
standard
for
sure
and
now
i
understand
why
not
outstanding
for
any
one
particular
reason
outstanding
because
everything
here
is
done
well
readily
findable
and
not
expensive
a
perfect
fallback
beer
and
something
i
plan
on
drinking
plenty
more
times
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
probably
the
best
known
beer
in
the
style
i
probably
had
my
first
one
of
these
about
15
years
ago
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
and
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
makes
me
think
of
being
in
san
fran
nice
copperamber
color
and
formed
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
some
hops
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slight
citrus
aspect
the
finish
was
a
touch
astrigent
giving
it
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
slight
head
earthy
aroma
and
earthy
flavor
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
some
lemon
zest
hanging
out
the
malt
hides
underneath
and
never
eager
to
hog
the
attention
from
his
friendly
neighbors
a
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
a
smooth
drink
very
easy
to
session
and
an
overall
good
beer
overall
paired
with
the
chowder
this
was
a
winner
an
easy
to
quaff
slightly
sweet
overall
beer
that
can
quench
your
thirst
a
solid
beer
though
one
i
most
likely
wont
have
again
unless
in
the
area
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
vibrant
clarity
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
shallow
off
white
head
lots
of
caramel
malt
on
the
nose

subtle
notes
of
biscuit
and

scents

a
subtle

presence

to

with
a
good
malt
foundation
lots
of
carbonation
dry
bready
characteristics
up
front
with
touches
of
caramel
sweetness
balanced
by
a
crisp
finish
definately
tasty
and
more
than
drinkable
slight
floral
presence
big
for
a
small
beer
that
holds
up
really
well
i
love
the
unique
twist
of
this
beer
being
a
lager
fermented
at
warmer
temperatures
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
fruit
but
you
definately
get
that
alelager
hybrid
feel
a
bit
disappointed
overall
i
dont
know
why
but
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
possibly
my
favorite
easy
drinking
ale
on
the
market
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
welcomed
2
inch
white
head
smell
is
primarily
malt
based
not
heavy
with
some
bitter
and
citrus
hop
fragrances
smells
like
a
beer
the
revolutionaries
would
have
been
drinking
in
boston
back
in
the
day
it
just
has
that
important
timeless
nobility
in
its
nose
flavor
is
amazingly
well
balanced
with
more
hops
in
the
finish
than
the
nose
gave
away
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
its
down
easy
but
not
in
a
throwaway
sense
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
every
sip
can
be
a
pleasurable
experience
great
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
im
happy
to
drink
this
all
day
everyday
it
goes
well
with
a
lot
of
food
is
reasonably
affordable
and
is
interesting
enough
to
old
my
attention
i
am
always
excited
to
see
it
on
shelves
back
east
this
has
been
one
of
my
go
to
beers
for
years
this
is
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
colored
beer
the
head
is
offwhite
that
holds
decently
smells
slightly
like
caramel
with
hints
of
bread
and
grains
tastes
similar
to
the
aroma
tasting
very
bready
and
grainy
a
very
balanced
beer
with
earthy
qualities
o
a
great
beer
very
earthy
and
easy
to
take
in
i
think
this
one
would
be
very
approachable
to
a
noncraft
beer
drinker
o
very
good
this
isnt
a
huge
seller
in
my
area
but
that
leaves
more
for
me
excellent
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
couple
per
sitting
o
excellent
choice
as
a
session
beer
or
replacement
for
one
of
any
light
or
macroadjunct
beer
slightly
milder
than
an
average
apa
but
with
as
much
flavor
should
work
well
with
many
lighterflavored
foods
overall
its
a
great
little
beer
and
there
is
nothing
else
quite
like
it
right
smack
in
between
a
lager
and
an
ale
this
classic
brew
will
always
be
a
good
choice
o
a
very
nice
beer
i
prefer
more
intense
ales
porters
and
stouts
and
this
is
far
from
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
want
on
hand
now
to
attempt
to
make
an
imperial
version
poured
from
a
bottle
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazy
slow
bubbling
orangecopper
coloring
that
has
a
thin
filmy
white
head
of
very
low
profile
aromas
are
very
well
blended
with
a
caramel
malt
presence
and
roasted
characteristics
flavors
showcase
a
more
tangy
malt
presence
with
a
good
hops
bitterness
to
balance
from
the
background
the
roasty
character
and
the
peppery
spices
from
the
hops
are
great
accents
to
the
malty
backbone
of
the
beer
smooth
bodied
with
a
crispness
to
the
finish
from
the
hops
the
aftertaste
is
a
good
blend
of
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
roasty
notes
very
well
balanced
beer
and
insanely
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
unique
brew
very
complex
yet
everything
balances
nicely
could
definitely
be
a
top
pick
session
beer
for
me
as
it
is
very
drinkable
bot
too
bitter
and
not
to
malty
or
sweet
very
good
beer
o
its
not
one
of
the
greatest
beers
out
there
but
ill
probably
come
back
to
it
just
to
rereview
its
just
one
of
the
best
allaround
beers
period
im
glad
i
did
as
it
was
very
enjoyable
ill
need
to
try
again
because
there
is
no
way
this
beer
is
as
famous
and
world
renowned
as
it
is
if
it
tastes
as
i
had
it
i
was
hoping
by
being
in
the
hometown
it
would
result
in
an
above
par
experience
but
that
was
not
the
case
medium
carbonation
medium
body
an
enjoyable
drink
my
favourite
element
of
the
beer
is
its
taste
well
balanced
and
robust
sweet
caramelized
malts
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
anchor
brewing
was
purchased
in
the
1975
by
fritz
maytag
and
helped
revitalize
regional
brewing
in
the
us
a
precursor
to
the
craft
explosion
we
get
to
enjoy
today
anchors
flagship
brew
is
anchor
steam
which
falls
into
the
california
common
style
category
a
hybrid
by
the
use
of
lager
yeast
at
warmer
then
usual
temperatures
this
beer
pours
slightly
orange
with
flashes
of
amber
a
frothy
head
that
provides
good
lacing
throughout
bready
malty
tones
are
first
observed
with
slight
yeastiness
poking
through
as
the
beer
warms
simple
and
pleasant
again
the
bready
malt
meets
with
hints
of
yeasty
flavors
while
the
brew
shows
a
moderate
level
of
bitterness
slight
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
that
all
lead
into
a
clean
crisp
finish
a
light
to
medium
body
is
met
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
a
great
example
of
this
style
i
really
dont
get
why
this
beer
is
hyped
every
time
i
come
back
to
it
im
left
underwhelmed
o
very
refreshing
classic
style
i
will
definitely
try
more
during
the
summer
overall
having
known
nothing
about
this
beer
before
i
bought
it
id
say
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
the
california
commonsteam
beer
genre
may
not
necessarily
be
my
cup
o
tea
but
this
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
nonetheless
one
that
i
would
certainly
recommend
for
both
an
experienced
craft
brew
drinker
or
a
relative
newcomer
alike
its
got
a
little
more
carbonation
that
i
like
just
the
right
viscosity
definitely
a
session
beer
could
easily
put
a
couple
of
these
down
without
getting
tired
of
them
othis
was
one
of
the
first
good
beers
i
had
every
had
way
back
in
the
day
i
think
i
am
likely
not
along
in
that
this
beer
style
made
california
common
a
house
hold
name
due
to
the
fact
that
no
one
else
is
allowed
to
claim
steam
beer
although
not
overly
complex
i
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
an
amazing
drinkable
beer
a
timeless
classic
a
craft
beer
when
no
one
knew
what
that
meant
someone
had
purchased
this
for
me
as
a
gift
and
i
was
happy
to
drink
it
for
the
first
time
in
a
very
long
time
o
nice
drinkable
beer
with
mild
but
delicious
flavor
well
done
this
is
a
pioneer
that
helped
to
fire
off
the
craft
beer
revolution
i
used
to
buy
this
at
the
food
giant
in
wallingford
and
always
looked
forward
to
the
nice
bitterness
and
flavor
that
put
it
in
a
different
class
from
the
commonly
available
beers
i
havent
had
any
in
years
so
when
i
got
a
bottle
as
a
gift
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
good
nostalgic
taste
and
i
am
not
disappointed
i
could
drink
this
all
night
while
watching
good
movies
or
cartoons
and
know
that
the
evening
was
well
spent
for
you
folks
that
want
to
look
into
the
world
of
alternative
beer
this
is
just
about
the
best
place
to
start
decent
bitterness
without
a
strong
skunky
malt
smell
or
flavor
and
one
swig
leaves
you
wishing
for
another
many
thanks
to
the
guy
who
got
this
distributed
up
here
in
the
cloudy
zone
back
in
the
70s
from
the
bottle
marked
1sl
sampled
on
christmas
day
2011
it
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
small
head
that
becomes
a
ring
while
leaving
a
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
barley
biscuit
and
sweetness
with
a
nice
hoppy
balance
the
body
falls
into
the
medium
range
the
taste
has
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
ive
had
a
few
different
breweries
version
of
this
beer
steam
or
california
common
as
some
call
it
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
ones
that
are
a
little
more
biscuity
and
have
more
hop
aroma
this
one
is
a
little
less
of
those
2
features
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
a
definitive
version
of
a
classic
style
i
love
this
beer
o
pretty
good
above
average
lighter
ale
not
overly
complex
and
thus
very
approachable
would
recommend
o
this
is
pretty
damn
good
and
like
many
of
the
wellknown
craft
beers
sn
pale
ale
sa
boston
lager
has
a
good
degree
of
versatility
as
well
on
the
other
hand
its
not
my
favorite
and
truth
be
told
i
think
i
prefer
flying
dog
old
scratch
if
were
staying
in
the
nottoowell
represented
style
of
the
california
common
overall
o
i
can
see
why
this
beer
made
it
big
i
can
appreciate
the
approachability
of
the
beer
its
just
mediocre
to
me
its
a
completely
different
beer
than
what
the
smell
suggests
the
malt
is
definitely
the
most
salient
flavor
semisweet
and
very
bready
almost
musty
the
hops
are
also
pretty
prominent
and
intertwoven
with
the
other
flavors
theyre
present
from
start
to
end
finishes
dry
with
a
grainy
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
perhaps
one
of
the
best
easily
obtainable
beers
when
its
time
to
splurge
moneywise
a
little
anchor
steam
is
always
considered
highly
recommended
o
truly
one
of
a
kind
this
beer
has
an
xfactor
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
orval
rich
in
flavor
yet
relatively
simple
and
refreshing
ocant
get
anything
like
it
this
baby
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
and
i
am
always
happy
to
drink
it
i
guess
essentially
i
am
drinking
a
lagerale
hybrid
not
bad
its
different
just
dont
go
into
it
expecting
something
its
not
a
good
beer
that
is
probably
the
flagship
beer
for
the
style
easily
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
and
just
so
damn
unique
the
original
of
its
style
and
arguably
still
the
best
example
o
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
maybe
because
i
was
expecting
something
different
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
but
there
may
be
some
that
will
like
this
style
tastes
like
all
the
other
beers
out
there
i
used
to
drink
before
i
got
into
craft
brew
i
kinda
feel
like
i
would
of
enjoyed
it
more
from
the
bottle
perhaps
this
is
something
i
would
drink
again
and
recommend
to
others
and
have
with
rich
fatty
foods
to
cut
the
hoppiness
down
many
years
and
beers
have
passed
ever
since
and
although
its
never
been
a
favorite
of
mine
its
a
damn
good
lager
that
i
enjoy
occasionally
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
with
just
enough
carbonation
could
be
the
glass
obetter
than
the
sn
beer
camp
but
still
nothing
there
that
wows
me
or
would
keep
me
coming
back
overall
drinkability
this
is
the
grandaddy
of
steam
beers
so
it
almost
cant
get
a
bad
grade
here
since
im
rating
by
style
its
somewhat
enjoyable
but
despite
even
my
infatuation
with
the
city
of
san
francisco
i
cannot
convince
myself
to
say
this
is
a
particularly
good
beer
good
in
style
perhaps
but
overall
i
dont
find
it
all
that
special
except
for
the
fact
that
i
first
had
this
beer
on
my
honeymoon
in
sf
but
even
nostalgia
cant
sway
me
here
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
which
one
would
expect
from
a
signature
beer
like
this
my
only
dislike
is
a
sourness
that
seems
to
stick
through
the
aftertaste
still
a
nice
flavor
that
flows
with
the
feel
well
overall
this
is
a
decent
flagship
beer
from
anchor
im
anxious
to
see
what
else
they
have
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
buy
this
beer
preferably
on
tap
then
do
so
anchor
steam
pours
a
bright
copper
with
a
nice
but
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
slightly
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
fruity
tinge
the
flavor
is
nicely
malty
without
being
too
sweet
there
is
a
nice
bready
buscuity
malt
character
more
caramel
and
some
slightly
dark
raisiny
fruitiness
are
balanced
by
a
mild
hop
bitterness
some
mild
herbal
hops
pop
through
in
the
finish
there
is
an
odd
slightly
sour
estery
flavor
in
the
finish
the
flagship
beer
from
an
iconic
brewery
this
pours
a
autumnstraw
burnt
toast
color
with
a
generous
amount
of
foam
great
nose
with
a
muted
maltiness
i
pick
up
a
light
malty
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
a
dark
biscuit
on
the
taste
the
effervescence
keeps
it
light
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
an
old
favorite
and
a
classic
standby
o
quite
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
usually
prefer
darkheavy
beers
but
this
was
satisfying
it
has
a
very
good
flavor
profile
for
a
light
beer
i
happen
to
pick
only
one
bottle
but
i
wish
i
got
a
6pack
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
beer
drinker
i
also
see
this
appropriate
for
almost
any
drinking
occasion
cheers
d
beautifully
balanced
flavourful
and
very
sessionable
it
isnt
hard
to
see
why
this
one
has
such
a
fine
reputation
poured
from
a
bottle
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
mostly
dissipates
minimal
lacing
aroma
was
that
of
earthy
notes
and
citrus
tasted
of
funky
wheat
malts
and
citrus
light
to
lightmedium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
once
in
awhile
still
a
good
beer
dark
gold
in
appearance
slight
cloud
to
this
beer
the
smell
has
a
nice
hop
to
it
that
is
very
close
to
the
overall
taste
very
clean
mouthfeel
hits
the
mouth
and
leaves
nicely
will
remind
you
of
a
pale
ale
the
taste
is
nicely
hopped
and
sits
nice
in
the
mouth
overall
we
like
this
beer
and
find
it
very
drinkable
and
one
to
have
in
the
fridge
will
go
with
any
type
of
bar
food
we
think
some
good
wings
overall
i
would
recommend
this
for
anyone
looking
for
a
session
beer
that
doesnt
take
a
backseat
in
the
flavor
department
this
will
make
my
kegerator
again
in
the
future
for
sure
o
definitely
a
good
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
it
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
to
which
i
introduce
my
nonbeerloving
friends
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
a
warm
fall
afternoon
o
i
cant
recall
ever
having
anchor
steam
prior
to
this
review
which
surprised
me
but
regardless
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
which
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
again
in
the
future
its
very
well
rounded
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
tastiest
lagers
a
person
will
find
it
has
shades
of
an
english
ale
which
is
what
i
think
is
drawing
me
to
it
so
well
highly
recommended
excellent
refreshing
brew
o
this
beer
had
fantastic
balance
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
at
any
bbq
anytime
ever
tasty
o
cool
style
ive
never
had
it
before
i
love
a
complex
lager
and
the
yeast
gives
some
itneresting
flavor
this
is
available
all
over
and
fairly
delicious
recommended
as
a
gateway
beer
at
the
very
least
overall
a
really
great
flavorful
beer
dont
have
too
much
experience
with
a
california
common
style
beer
but
this
seems
to
really
fit
the
bill
def
a
good
choice
cheers
o
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
that
i
often
overlook
it
is
full
over
flavor
and
has
a
nice
refreshing
balance
o
a
unique
american
lager
im
really
glad
to
see
our
country
representing
in
the
lager
game
especially
with
a
style
all
our
own
lager
doesnt
mean
boring
beer
in
fact
some
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
are
lagers
mostly
german
though
nice
going
anchor
steam
gotta
love
good
beer
with
good
history
d
as
the
prototype
commonsteam
beer
i
was
pretty
disappointed
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
pours
a
beautifully
clear
deep
gold
color
with
a
three
finger
pillowy
head
there
are
tons
and
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
looks
very
nice
in
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
toasted
malt
and
grassy
hops
nothing
wildly
complex
but
it
smells
good
the
taste
is
mostly
toasty
and
caramel
malts
it
finishes
with
pleasant
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
high
this
is
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
beer
overall
incredible
for
the
style
light
and
refreshing
yet
still
maintains
a
rich
flavor
throughout
highly
recommended
effortlessly
drinkable
yet
hugely
tasty
and
always
welcome
o
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
has
a
really
good
flavor
profile
and
its
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
a
quality
crafted
brew
thats
been
holding
steady
for
a
really
long
time
this
is
some
solid
stuff
highly
refreshing
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
o
i
had
never
had
a
beer
in
this
style
before
and
decided
this
was
as
good
a
beer
as
any
to
start
on
i
can
see
why
its
been
brewed
for
over
100
years
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
a
great
go
to
it
is
very
unique
but
tastes
great
is
priced
well
and
not
hard
to
find
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
well
balanced
and
refreshingan
easy
session
beer
o
yep
its
a
classic
rich
in
flavour
handsome
sessionable
affordable
great
beer
defines
the
style
so
rating
to
style
is
almost
redundant
uniquely
crafted
sessionable
ale
that
immediately
brings
to
mind
foggy
summer
mornings
in
the
city
not
often
craved
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
it
little
else
will
do
o
havent
had
this
in
a
while
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
that
is
plenty
easy
to
drink
i
can
see
why
this
is
an
old
reliable
for
many
a
craft
beer
drinker
o
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
a
well
done
beer
o
very
drinkable
old
standby
this
beer
is
often
priced
in
the
13
50
range
for
a
six
pack
in
the
ny
area
but
if
you
do
some
looking
you
can
find
it
for
11
99
some
places
kind
of
a
lot
but
its
a
more
special
beer
than
i
remember
cheers
fullish
in
body
quite
well
carbonated
somewhat
scrubbing
its
been
perhaps
four
years
since
i
first
had
anchor
steam
and
i
had
no
real
memory
of
this
beer
a
bit
muddled
on
the
whole
certainly
not
bad
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
good
amount
of
carbonation
you
really
can
taste
it
this
beer
just
hit
all
the
right
buttons
for
me
tonight
having
previously
enjoyed
this
on
many
occasions
i
have
tended
to
overlook
this
as
its
readily
available
in
a
world
of
the
elusive
hunt
and
desire
to
seek
out
more
limited
or
exciting
beers
not
really
overly
complicated
or
vivid
but
really
well
executed
overall
an
excellent
drinking
beer
with
wonderful
mouthfeel
although
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
on
the
whole
a
good
beer
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
could
definitely
knock
a
few
in
one
night
first
time
ive
used
this
word
in
a
review
quaffable
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
look
the
coloring
was
deep
rich
and
dark
with
a
nice
frame
of
a
head
where
we
lost
points
was
in
the
adjuncty
grain
through
the
middle
which
became
harsh
at
times
despite
this
the
licorice
vibe
as
a
primary
source
of
sweetness
was
something
that
kept
the
drinker
interested
and
coming
back
for
more
copperbrown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
very
bready
and
somewhat
earthy
very
smooth
and
malty
with
muted
hops
i
do
not
know
how
some
people
pick
out
10
different
flavors
in
this
beer
i
do
not
find
it
that
complex
very
drinkable
though
o
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
the
classic
in
its
style
i
dont
drink
it
often
but
when
i
want
it
its
always
there
it
tastes
good
as
well
the
flavors
were
pretty
light
it
worked
well
for
a
warm
summer
afternoon
final
thoughts
good
o
have
not
had
an
as
for
years
what
a
fun
rediscovery
for
me
very
good
drinkability
and
a
very
well
rounded
malt
hop
profile
brought
a
smile
memories
my
san
fran
apt
a
quality
beer
4
similar
to
a
blonde
ale
this
beer
is
sweeter
crystal
malt
combined
with
lager
yeast
making
is
crisp
and
clean
without
any
real
hop
profile
beyond
aroma
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
not
great
but
good
the
beer
has
a
great
balance
the
sweetness
is
very
consistent
throughout
the
taste
and
provides
a
nice
balance
with
that
fruity
zing
adding
to
the
balance
the
bitterness
is
more
than
i
was
expecting
in
a
good
way
because
it
has
decent
flavors
i
may
buy
again
if
it
went
on
sale
otherwise
nothing
really
stood
out
to
write
home
about
tangy
and
effervescent
a
little
cloudy
in
color
and
very
refreshing
with
a
little
bitterness
too
boot
used
to
see
it
regularly
but
not
so
much
in
my
neck
of
the
wood
anymore
gotta
look
for
it
makes
the
big
houses
taste
like
water
by
comparison
they
make
a
great
porter
too
make
sure
you
drink
this
thing
at
a
lower
temperature
warming
really
doesnt
do
it
any
favors
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
balanced
beer
with
an
extra
smokey
twist
ill
drink
this
as
it
is
or
perhaps
with
smokey
sausages
i
want
more
overall
very
drinkable
it
has
been
too
long
since
i
had
this
beer
defines
the
steam
beer
style
overall
nice
tastes
like
what
i
would
think
adjunct
brewers
are
going
for
too
bad
theyre
so
cheap
and
dont
make
mainstream
beer
taste
good
like
this
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
other
beers
of
this
style
get
compared
too
i
really
enjoy
this
one
and
will
always
take
one
if
offered
and
will
still
buy
on
occasion
o
not
crazy
about
this
one
but
its
better
than
bmc
products
not
recommended
at
this
time
poured
a
beautiful
light
amber
color
smell
is
incredibly
sweet
malts
caramel
and
strong
honey
taste
is
extremely
light
smooth
and
sweet
with
some
balancing
hop
citrus
zest
and
bitterness
an
incredibly
unique
beer
as
well
as
incredibly
refreshing
theres
a
good
reason
why
its
been
such
an
influential
pioneering
brew
o
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
very
similar
to
an
amber
lager
with
that
being
said
not
my
first
choice
in
the
variety
but
a
craft
classic
and
worth
a
a
try
a
true
classic
a
protocraft
beer
if
you
will
and
really
something
worth
revisiting
after
a
long
absence
or
a
couple
of
times
a
week
for
sipping
either
way
you
are
in
good
company
with
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
large
off
white
head
which
has
great
retention
smell
is
of
bready
bisquity
malts
with
a
little
hops
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
good
you
get
the
wave
of
bisquit
bready
matls
up
front
with
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
its
followed
by
a
weird
lingering
after
taste
which
is
hard
to
describe
perhaps
metallic
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
one
ill
get
again
o
just
a
great
all
around
beer
its
one
of
the
standard
go
to
brews
in
our
fridge
a
solid
example
of
the
quality
that
comes
from
anchor
love
this
beer
overall
a
great
simple
beer
crisp
clean
and
easy
to
enjoyjust
like
us
californians
great
lager
t
there
was
actually
a
lot
more
to
this
beer
than
i
expected
to
find
smooth
malts
at
first
followed
by
some
earthy
hops
and
bready
malts
on
the
finish
theres
a
nice
bitterness
that
youre
left
with
on
the
finish
that
definitely
keeps
you
coming
back
overall
a
true
standout
classic
amongst
craft
brewing
as
an
sf
resident
im
quite
proud
to
call
this
our
iconic
flagship
beer
i
always
take
this
over
a
pale
ale
any
day
due
to
its
unique
fruity
and
malty
flavor
overall
id
tried
this
one
years
ago
and
forgot
the
taste
but
ba
got
me
curious
what
a
nice
surprise
id
drink
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
cant
wait
to
try
anchors
liberty
ale
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
quite
a
time
now
and
i
recently
got
my
hand
on
a
bottle
of
it
ive
tried
oslo
mikrobryggeris
steamer
and
i
dont
really
feel
anchor
steam
beer
reaches
the
same
level
i
was
kind
of
disapointed
good
solid
beer
now
this
is
one
jimdandy
of
a
brew
this
brew
poured
up
a
hazy
coppercolored
body
with
a
wonderfully
thick
offwhite
colored
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
effects
on
the
glass
aromas
of
malts
caramel
citrus
fruits
lemons
and
maybe
some
orange
flavors
of
the
same
in
a
malty
concoction
that
beckons
you
to
take
the
next
sip
just
as
soon
as
you
finish
one
mediumbodied
fullflavored
with
a
dry
finish
and
citrusy
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
type
of
lager
id
certainly
drink
it
again
it
has
the
hoppiness
that
i
like
from
pale
ales
with
the
nice
malty
flavours
and
crispness
of
a
good
lager
o
i
have
tried
many
california
commons
and
this
is
still
by
far
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
balanced
and
fairly
complex
this
is
an
enjoyable
steam
lager
from
the
brewery
that
pioneered
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
summer
or
to
have
on
tap
while
enjoying
some
of
your
favorite
seafood
at
a
raw
bar
light
and
refreshing
nothing
overpowering
o
i
know
this
beer
is
very
popular
and
being
a
brewer
it
is
interesting
to
read
about
the
techniques
used
in
making
this
beer
however
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
i
havent
had
many
cal
commons
before
but
i
am
told
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
though
overall
nice
beer
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
drank
an
anchor
steam
i
forgot
how
good
it
is
the
color
is
a
rich
amber
and
clear
decent
white
head
that
laced
pretty
well
there
was
not
much
to
smell
other
than
hints
of
malt
and
bread
the
taste
was
good
definite
malt
base
that
was
balanced
neatly
with
hops
the
beer
had
some
body
but
was
still
light
on
the
pallet
mouthfeel
was
great
very
easy
to
drink
and
had
anice
clean
finish
12oz
bottle
served
in
an
american
pint
at
53
degrees

on
the
back

pours
a
translucent
burntorange
with
a
dense
2
5
inch
creamcolored
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
with
some
residual
spots
of
lacing
revealed
as
the
brew
recedes
nose
reveals
noble
hops
aromatics
and
light
toasted
malts
taste
follows
nose
hops
presence
is
not
overpowering
but
overwhelms
the
malt
profile
theres
also
a
faint
citrus
quality
interspersed
across
the
backbone
and
finish
is
not
really
bitter
but
there
is
a
slight
floralearthy
character
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
just
a
kiss
of
acidity
i
cant
say
that
ive
had
many
opportunities
to
try
this
style
out
but
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
i
can
see
it
pairing
well
with
food
but
there
are
other
brews
i
would
go
to
before
seeking
this
one
out
again
this
is
just
a
very
drinkable
beer
there
arent
a
lot
of
prominent
flavors
that
confront
the
palate
but
it
goes
down
so
nicely
smooth
when
it
should
be
smooth
and
crisp
when
it
should
be
crisp
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
cost
prohibitive
for
me
to
enjoy
it
regularly
around
here
o
smooth
drinker
that
goes
down
easy
great
example
of
the
style
an
american
original
this
is
a
must
try
beer
solid
lager
here
clean
and
crisp
yet
substantial
taste
profile
i
guess
this
is
a
craft
beer
legend
for
a
reason
note
after
further
reading
i
see
that
asb
is
technically
a
lager
it
is
a
lager
that
tastes
alot
like
an
ale
much
like
kolsch
is
an
ale
that
tastes
alot
like
a
lager
this
fact
only
accentuates
the
unique
greatness
of
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
a
classic
example
of
the
california
common
style
pours
a
deep
amberorange
color
and
gives
a
nice
white
two
finger
head
that
slowly
fades
to
some
excellent
lacing
smell
is
of
yeast
citrus
and
a
hint
of
earthy
wood
hoppy
character
is
the
nose
for
sure
taste
follows
suit
with
some
earthy
hops
malts
and
some
citrus
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
but
not
too
much
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
a
great
way
to
get
into
the
california
common
style
nose
hop
soft
and
warm
a
little
wood
mint
too
the
taste
is
hoppy
but
not
excessively
it
contains
malt
and
slightly
sweet
which
gives
an
almost
imperceptible
hint
of
caramel
beer
pleasant
easy
drinking
and
should
deploy
its
full
power
enjoyed
on
a
long
beach
in
the
state
of
california
d
lighter
than
it
should
be
given
everything
thats
going
on
but
still
quite
a
body
a
real
beer
drinkers
experience
nicely
balanced
very
unique
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
creamy
texture
that
adds
fullness
to
the
palate
crisp
floral
hop
presence
up
front
thats
only
faintly
dry
and
bitter
this
is
countered
by
the
sweet
malt
and
light
fruit
notes
hints
of
caramel
biscuit
toffee
hazelnut
and
apricot
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
its
well
crafted
and
sessionable
comes
out
a
deep
orange
red
and
gives
off
a
grassy
aroma
the
taste
starts
crisp
builds
a
slight
appley
taste
and
finishes
with
some
piney
hops
which
linger
on
the
tongue
and
strengthen
as
the
beer
warms
even
though
the
head
quickly
disappears
theres
enough
carbonation
that
leave
me
burping
for
a
while
while
this
is
not
a
particularly
strong
brew
its
more
complex
than
one
might
suspect
wont
be
buying
this
again
in
stores
but
since
tonight
is
2
draft
night
i
might
spend
another
6
bucks
overall
good
all
the
way
around
ive
never
tried
a
california
common
but
its
not
a
style
i
will
shy
away
from
in
the
future
very
nice
standard
for
the
california
common
smooth
and
sessionable
but
has
much
in
common
with
any
other
amber
lager
its
appearance
stands
out
never
had
such
an
impressive
head
on
a
lager
before
there
are
other
beers
id
rather
session
but
if
anyone
asks
for
the
style
this
is
the
way
to
go
o
i
like
this
beer
it
is
uncomplicated
and
straightforward
a
little
understated
and
very
refreshing
every
bit
as
good
as
i
remember
it
from
decades
ago
i
hope
the
new
owners
can
keep
it
this
way
for
years
to
come
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
session
beer
this
was
brilliant
smooth
drinkable
and
surprisingly
complex
for
what
it
is
theres
a
reason
they
named
the
style
after
anchor
steam
o
a
great
beer
definitely
session
worthy
overall
even
though
i
have
had
many
many
beers
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
one
impressions
are
that
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
if
you
want
to
have
something
in
between
boring
and
crazy
this
would
seem
to
me
as
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
any
type
of
dinner
45
pours
a
nice
orange
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
mostly
some
light
malts
in
the
nose
and
i
didnt
detect
much
else
going
on
flavors
had
a
lot
of
malt
and
some
orange
citrus
flavors
crisp
and
bitter
to
the
taste
some
other
rather
fruity
and
nutty
notes
that
i
cant
quite
detect
exactly
what
they
are
a
bit
bubbly
but
not
in
a
bad
way
o
this
is
my
favorite
cali
common
the
flavors
are
simple
and
it
is
extremely
easy
drinking
i
am
glad
we
are
finally
starting
to
see
more
anchor
products
in
our
area
nice
beer
will
have
to
get
again
tastes
are
bitter
caramel
crusts
salt
finishing
hops
sogginess
bread
pistachios
cornbread
and
yeast
smells
of
caramel
bitterness
more
hops
stringy
barley
and
weirdly
enough
i
know
brandyesque
booze
available
anywhere
one
reason
i
rated
this
guy
overall
this
beer
is
average
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
its
too
sourastringent
overall
a
beer
that
is
the
classic
example
of
the
style
but
is
not
the
end
all
dvery
drinkable
and
my
introduction
to
the
style
a
light
but
complex
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
chestnut
with
a
1
finger
head
that
laces
around
the
glass
quickly
maple
syrup
on
the
smell
sweet
malt
sugary
much
like
a
bock
sweet
sugars
on
the
tongue
caramel
very
grainy
lager
taste
a
tad
bitter
on
the
finish
the
feel
light
and
dry
very
enjoyable
beer
has
alot
of
good
characteristics
that
are
hybrid
from
other
styles
love
the
look
description
on
the
bottle
and
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
however
its
a
bit
too
mild
for
my
regular
tastes
especially
at
the
price
in
ontario
in
a
class
of
its
own
im
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
i
will
recommend
it
to
others
overall
this
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
is
one
of
the
great
session
brews
to
come
out
of
the
states
a
classic
all
in
its
own
this
tasty
brew
is
one
for
the
ages
o
what
can
i
say
its
anchor
steam
its
phenomenally
unique
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
pretty
much
anytime
smells
bready
metallic
and
a
bit
earthy
flavor
profile
starts
there
only
more
intense
bitter
to
near
astringency
which
contributes
to
a
bone
dry
finish
raw
and
spicy
ample
carbonation
fluffs
it
up
to
a
fuller
feel
than
anticipated
mildly
sweet
moderately
toasty
exceedingly
grainy
nothing
wrong
with
revisiting
a
classic
now
and
then
nope
very
drinkable
would
like
to
do
a
full
session
with
these
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
would
like
to
try
steambeer
overall
a
very
tasty
and
rich
brew
o
a
classic
craft
beer
i
wish
more
craft
breweries
would
make
a
california
common
beer
for
me
to
compare
this
to
but
a
very
smooth
drinking
lager
12
ounce
stubby
bottle
poured
into
a
10
ounce
glass
its
been
years
perhaps
a
decade
even
since
i
last
had
the
famous
anchor
steam
beer
pouring
it
again
for
the
first
time
and
im
struck
by
the
loads
upon
loads
of
carbonation
in
the
brew
the
bubbles
just
go
on
for
days
upon
further
inspection
this
beer
is
brilliantly
clear
as
you
can
easily
read
the
label
from
behind
the
glass
a
big
frothy
head
bursts
to

as
quickly
color
is

than
gold
but
not
quite
amber
settling
in
at
a
rusty
orange
smells
of
a
light
grain
almost
like
a
pilsner
first
taste
is
sweet
almost
fruity
with
a
very
sweet
malt
finish
this
this
is
not
like
i
remember
at
all
moderate
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
not
overpowering
at
all
slightly
sticky
and
relatively
thick
mouth
feel
though
the
heavy
carbonation
helps
to
scrub
the
taste
off
your
tongue
as
you
drink
it
as
you
continue
to
taste
the
malt
becomes
more
and
more
pronounced
and
it
works
in
context
with
the
yeast
profile
to
create
almost
a
jam
and
bread
flavor
an
underrated
gem
o
if
there
is
no
other
game
in
town
then
go
for
it
but
i
probably
would
been
better
off
with
just
a
water
o
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
its
one
of
the
beers
that
prompted
me
to
start
exploring
in
my
early
days
its
kind
of
strange
to
come
back
to
it
i
think
my
palate
has
been
irreversibly
changed
by
the
beers
that
i
drank
in
the
intervening
years
but
in
many
ways
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
pale
copper
colour
light
white

no

to
speak
of
here

slight

slight

bitterness
in
the
nose
taste
is
big
malt
caramel
toffee
clean
with
a
light
bitter
finish
good
mouthfeel
big
carbonation
but
seems
to
not
last
on
the
palate
medium
weight
good
overall
brew
sessionable
and
nice
for
the
season
pours
with
a
big
foamy
head
tons
of
suds
the
beer
itself
is
teacolored
with
yellow
highlights
crisp
grassy
aroma
with
some
citrus
undertones
fresh
grain
mixed
with
creamy
berry
and
citrus
flavors
yeasty
with
some
slight
hop
bitterness
this
is
one
complex
beer
overall
a
delicious
lager
beer
with
enough
character
to
be
interesting
a
fine
beer
from
anchor
brewing
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
a
classic
a
big
stepping
stone
in
the
craft
beer
world
definitely
has
more
going
for
it
than
your
average
american
lager
but
not
something
id
feel
the
need
to
pick
up
often
on
tap
pours
a
translucent
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
layer
of

virtually
no

is
of
toasted

bread
and

is
sweet
toasted

and
a
slight

has
kind
of
a
cereal
taste
to
it
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
but
its
a
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
warm
weather
beers
and
worth
having
often
d
an
american
craft
classic
that
is
super
drinkable
and
showcases
an
american
hop
that
isnt
dominated
by
citrus
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
def
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
i
def
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
one
o
a
good
solid
beer
that
is
tasty
balanced
and
refreshing
i
feel
like
this
will
make
a
fantastic
summer
beer
and
a
nice
break
from
overthetop
ipas
this
is
the
beer
that
started
the
craft
beer
revolution
in
this
country
and
its
still
going
strong
all
of
these
years
later
i
hadnt
had
this
in
a
while
and
sitting
down
with
a
22
oz
helped
me
realize
again
how
flavorful
and
just
plain
drinkable
this
can
be
when
you
sit
down
with
it
40
years
later
and
still
going
strong
this
beer
is
a
winner
overall
i
can
see
myself
taking
this
one
to
every
barbeque
from
now
on
awesome
stuff
seems
quite
sessionable
this
is
a
good
consistant
brew
the
pour
is
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
solid
white
head
on
top
that
beer
a
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
pretty
standard
but
yet
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
mostly
hops
and
malts
on
the
tongue
the
smell
is
basically
the
same
mouthfeel
is
easy
going
a
good
social
beer
i
wise
choice
of
the
the
main
stream
beers
out
there
despite
its
mediocre
aroma
this
beer
really
came
out
and
shone
for
me
a
classic
american
craft
beer
the
west
coast
is
proud
pours
a
clear
organcopper
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
of
orange
tinted
white
head
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
has
a
good
malt
smell
right
off
the
bat
taste
goes
right
along
with
the
smell
sweet
malty
and
grain
flavors
taste
has
a
bitter
feel
to
it
that
balances
with
the
sweet
malt
flavors
well
has
a
medium
body
and
a
medium
balanced
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
refreshing
brew
from
the
west
coast
overall
i
think
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
session
beer
simple
in
pretty
much
everything
which
works
really
well
i
think
anchor
does
the
style
more
than
justice
and
might
actually
pick
up
a
six
pack
in
the
future
o
very
drinkable
pretty
tasty
nothing
bad
just
not
something
that
will
be
my
goto

a
d
overall
very
enjoyable
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
but
it
was
great
and
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
drink
a
few
of
overall
a
very
balanced
tasty
beer
that
i
will
be
going
back
to
this
is
the
ca
common
flagship
it
is
a
good
beer
that
is
lagery
in
quality
but
has
the
esters
of
an
ale
that
really
give
it
character
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
but
not
watery
overall
very
nice
sessionable
brew
the
nose
and
the
finish
are
brilliant
making
up
for
the
slightly
weak
midpalate
overall
a
good
refreshing
tasty
beer
always
a
stand
by
in
my
fridge
overall
i
am
a
resident
of
the
san
francisco
bay
area
and
am
fascinated
by
this
breweries
long
standing
ability
to
brew
unique
session
beers
i
will
definitely
start
adding
anchor
steam
into
my
regular
rotations
overall
better
than
expected
and
a
beer
that
i
might
pick
up
in
the
summer
would
go
well
with
burgers
and
brats
on
the
grill
o
very
balanced
and
drinkable
i
could
and
certainly
have
had
a
number
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
great
session
beer
no
matter
the
occasion
copper
color
with
an
overabundance
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
kinda
hoppy
but
bland
the
taste
has
a
tartness
that
i
dont
find
appealing
like
its
meant
to
be
acidic
instead
of
build
character
the
finish
is
tart
leaving
a
somewhat
nasty
aftertaste
no
me
gusta
drain
pour
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
california
common
beer
is
a
nice
dark
amber
color
and
it
produces
a
thick
creamy
head
head
retention
is
good
and
it
leaves
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nice
showcasing
malt
and
hops
the
beer
has
a
nice
medium
body
malty
backbone
and
light
amounts
of
citrus
this
is
the
standard
bearer
for
california
common
or
steam
beer
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
saved
beer
in
america
anchor
steam
is
everything
a
craft
beer
should
be
flavor
is
a
crisp
and
fresh
citrusy
balancing
out
the
maltiness
and
grainy
character
a
very
delicious
lager
with
a
smooth
and
complex
flavor
profile
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
as
well
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
as
it
would
a
cool
fall
evening
o
this
is
a
really
good
standard
beer
type
of
beer
a
great
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
appropriate
for
just
about
any
occasion
again
crisp
and
clean
not
a
lot
of
aftertaste
and
what
is
there
is
that
perfume
you
get
in
the
nose
that
is
thrown
off
from
the
noble
hops
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
craft
brews
in
the
us
this
is
a
classic
and
at
the
risk
of
repeating
myself
deserves
respect
for
what
it
meant
to
the
craft
brew
movement
in
this
country
fritz
westinghouse
i
know
you
sold
it
but
you
saved
it
i
love
you
man
psst
thats
not
just
the
beer
talking
plus
my
girl
friend
not
a
beer
geek
but
a
girl
who
nonetheless
enjoys
a
good
beer
really
likes
this
one
theres
more
alcohol
taste
than
you
would
expect
with
a
sub
5
abv
a
slight
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweet
taste
of
apple
and
wheat
makes
this
beer
great
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
dr
far
too
expensive
in
ireland
but
certainly
worth
a
go
d
its
everywhere
affordable
and
americana
of
course
ill
be
getting
it
again
however
those
are
not
the
only
reasons
as
its
a
prety
decent
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
as
you
drink
it
the
aroma
has
hints
of
malty
sweetness
and
a
little
bit
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
beer
starting
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
and
some
honey
and
finishing
with
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
could
use
some
additional
citrus
hop
flavor
to
make
it
a
little
more
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
slight
amount
of
overcarbonation
overall
a
good
amber
hybrid
mouthfeel
is
vey
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
a
body
very
easy
to
deal
with
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
offering
in
the
steam
beer
category
tasty
and
easy
going
down
ill
have
another
one

golden
a
touch
of
amber
perhaps
great
white
head
good
retention
and
good
amount
of
lace
aroma
is
underwhelming
grain
and
whiff
of
spiciness
but
everything
is
very
muted
taste
a
bit
heartier
than
an
average
lager
refreshing

with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
some
unroasted
malt
in
the
middle
with
an
understated
amount
of

popcorn
after
then
finish
the
cpj
drinks
very
easily
an
easy
session
beer
with
a
very
easily
managable
abv
this
could
be
a
pivotal
beer
in
converting
a
bmc
drinker
to
craft
i
would
come
back
to
this
but
imho
its
only
slightly
better
than
say
yuengling
but
practically
double
the
cost
however
i
think
every
craft
enthusiast
should
atleast
try
this
once
d
heavy
drinkability
in
terms
of
putting
back
a
true
bitter
beer
than
most
where
the
hops
stands
tall
and
fast
however
the
staleness
of
the
beer
would
be
hard
to
go
back
to
if
not
just
looking
for
beer

drink

wonderful

in

the
taste
gives
way
to
soft
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
biscuity
malt
quality
a
finely

buy

again
as
im
a

bored
with
it
considering
i
can
get
a
decent
ipa
at
a
cheaper
price
here
in
texas
theres
no
way
this
should
be
priced
more
than
any
sierra
nevada
sixer
iconic
not
bad
a
solid
b
rating
from
me
d
very
easy
to
drink
noting
mind
blowing
but
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
for
the
price
overall
good
for
its
style
i
just
tipped
up
the
bottle
was
disappointed
to
find
it
empty
already
this
was
nice
i
want
another
one
nothing
extreme
thankfully
but
faultless
looks
like
beer
smells
like
beer
tastes
like
beer
had
no
faults
what
mmore
can
you
ask
im
off
to
buy
some
more
right
now
notes
this
is
a
very
delightful
beer
very
good
example
of
the
style
would
of
given
this
one
a
better
rating
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
just
not
very
memorable
drinkabilty
taste
light
and
refreshing
so
quite
drinkable
certainly
one
i
would
choose
if
i
saw
it
in
a
pub
and
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
light
d
hard
to
get
past
the
flavor
perhaps
this
is
the
style
but
im
not
much
of
a
fan
a
benchmark
brew
for
all
true
beer
lovers
rich
complex
balanced
and

you
get
it

abv
what
more
can
you
say
its
as
damn
near
perfect
as
a
beer
can
be
and
the
quality
has
been
consistent
since
i
had
my
first
one
20
years
ago
fantastic
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
went
hand
in
hand
as
the
smoothness
and
dry
clean
finish
lent
itself
well
to
both
need
to
have
more
beers
in
this
uncommon
style
but
good
marks
for
this
one
dill
be
honest
this
is
on
the
same
level
as
many
bmc
beers
even
the
light
ones
i
dont
think
ill
ever
have
another
one
of
these
overall
absolutely
worth
it
might
have
to
be
in
the
mood
though
when
tasting
this
and
comparing
it
to
all
the
mass
produced
pilsners
you
can
understand
why
this
is
so
different
first
the
color
is
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
creamy
white
head
and
theres
actually
some
flavor
to
it
maltiness
with
some
bread
notes
and
a
hint
of
sour
in
the
finish
perhaps
not
a
worldclass
beer
but
it
is
certainly
an
american
classic
and
gets
bonus
points
for
the
history
and
revolution
it
helped
to
spawn
overall
grade
cb
drinkability
well
balanced
and
fantastic
tasting
beer
wish
i
had
more
will
seek
again
and
stock
for
future
needs
anchor
steam
beer
is
a
good
beer
its
a
little
bitter
than
i
would
like
a
cloudy
ale
but
that
could
be
because
its
steamed
i
would
recommend
anchor
steam
beer
to
my
friends
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
for
a
party
or
a
gettogether
anyone
who
tries
it
wont
be
disappointed
reminds
me
of
summer
poured
from
tap
as
well
as
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
colour
with
a
medium
big
white
foamy
head
that
settled
down
slowly
in
the
glass
aroma
is
grassy
with
some
notes
of
malts
and
grain
the
flavor
is
somewhat
bitter
but
not
as
bitter
as
most
lagers
flavour
is
grassy
notes
of
malts
and
hops
it
has
a
short
aftertaste
overall
a
bit
bland
beer
but
a
quality
session
beer
if
there
are
no
better
choices
d
this
tastes
like
a
better
maltheavy
version
of
a
macro
lager
d
all
around
this
is
a
superb
example
of
the
style
and
the
definition
of
a
good
sessionable
beer
tasted
wonderful
on
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
year
wonderful
hoppy
nose
the
hops
and
malt
are
wonderfully
balanced
i
think
something
special
happened
when
they
decided
to
brew
a
lager
at
ale
temps
the
lager
yeast
is
much
cleaner
than
ale
yeast
just
brewed
a
clone
recipe
of
this
cant
wait
till
its
ready
drinkability
despite
the
lack
of
foam
and
lacing
which
again
may
be
the
glass
no
way
of
knowing
i
think
i
like
this
beer
better
on
tap
than
in
a
bottle
went
very
well
with
crab
cakes
and
i
could
easily
put
back
another
16oz
a
very
drinkable
and
allaround
good
beer
anchor
steam
is
still
solid
just
as
i
remember
it
inexpensive
to
boot
too
and
easy
drinking
not
the
most
knockout
beer
ive
had
but
certainly
one
that
is
worth
its
price
and
then
some
and
easily
available
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
definitely
work
well
as
a
session
drink
d
nice
session
beer
if
you
want
to
go
for
taste
but
watch
the
abv
or
calories
lol
this
may
be
a
good
standard
brew
fine
gateway
beer
for
newbies
verdict
if
youve
ever
thought
about
trying
a
steam
beer
this
one
is
a
definite
good
starter
choice
very
drinkable
and
delicious
two
of
the
most
important
characteristics
of
the
perfect
beer
if
you
find
it
you
should
get
it
a
4
2
d
a
very
different
beer
unlike
any
ive
had
before
but
it
was
quite
enjoyable
it
isnt
too
complex
but
thats
what
makes
it
so
great
i
could
see
myself
easily
picking
up
a
6pack
after
trying
this
beer
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
not
extremely
complex
in
taste
but
definitely
unique
definitely
worth
a
sixpack
to
acclimate
yourself
to
the
taste
d
low
abv
easy
to
drink
outside
of
the
heavy
carbonation
overall
a
nice
beer
it
is
pretty
much
the
quintessential
california
common
beer
as
it
was
pretty
much
the
original
it
is
the
style
but
slowly
forms
of
it
are
starting
to
emerge
which
is
good
its
not
an
exceptional
beer
but
it
certainly
is
easydrinking
and
when
your
looking
for
a
couple
lagers
to
drink
one
night
or
looking
to
get
friends
into
craft
beer
this
may
be
the
beer
for
you
all
in
all
i
believe
that
i
received
an
inferior
example
of
this
style
due
to
storage
and
shipping
id
love
to
try
this
beer
fresh
on
tap
in
california
as
ive
heard
wonderful
things
highly
sessionable
this
brew
probably
could
have
been
a
winner
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
it
is
anchors
flagship
beer
and
has
by
far
the
most
reviews
of
any
steam
beer
there
is
a
fair
amount
going
on
here
especially
for
an
american
lager
at
4
9
d
very
drinkable
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
great
taste
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
because
it
was
way
lighter
than
expected
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
good
but
not
outstanding
d
pretty
solid
not
going
to
say
no
to
it
and
wouldnt
say
no
to
more
than
one
or
three
d
a
complex
and
very
drinkable
brew
the
flavour
are
interesting
while
being
light
and
refreshing
enough
to
be
a
great
session
option
i
got
this
sixpack
as
a
christmas
gift
this
year
and
had
not
heard
of
it
until
then
so
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
turned
out
to
be
a
great
gift
thanks
tony
d
little
to
no
alcohol
flavor
very
enjoyable
on
nice
day
d
enjoyable
as
it
got
warmer
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
this
is
definitely
a
real
beer
a
mans
beer
a
great
beer
for
warm
weather
looking
forward
to
having
again
sometime
i
would
describe
this
as
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
is
session
worthy
a
tasty
brew
this
is
great
drinkability
its
strength
come
from
it
averageness
it
doesnt
overpower
you
you
can
sip
it
or
you
can
throw
some
back
with
friends
its
fairly
common
in
stores
the
price
isnt
really
out
of
reach
for
most
people
its
better
than
the
macro
brews
but
not
snobbish
you
could
give
it
to
connoisseur
and
noob
alike
and
both
would
be
pleased
notes
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
a
beer
of
this
style
it
is
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
would
not
be
a
poor
choice
on
a
night
out
with
friends
it
looks
and
tastes
like
a
typical
american
amber
id
probably
have
mistaken
it
for
one
if
i
hadnt
any
knowledge
of
it
being
something
else
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
had
this
ontap
at
duartes
tavern
in
pescadero
ca
with
artichoke
soup
and
sourdough
bread
heavenly
trio
this
beer
is
absolutely
wonderful
on
tap
creamy
smooth
white
1
inch
head
sitting
atop
a
light
amber
transparent
body
smells
and
tastes
very
inviting
with
the
caramelmalt
backbone
complimented
superbly
by
the
fine
cone
hop
bitterness
to
even
things
out
a
wonderful
beer
and
one
of
the
best
lighter
usa
brews
i
have
ever
had
m
d
light
bodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
poured
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
with
aromas
of
toasted
malts
with
hints
of
citrus
the
first
drink
reveals
a
soft
bitternes
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
makes
this
american
classic
easy
to
drink
only
the
price
keeps
me
from
drinking
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
d
easily
poundable
with
a
good
hop
malt
balance
with
flavours
that
wont
overload
the
palette
highly
recommended
as
a
session
beer
and
another
quality
offering
from
anchor
taste
also
malty
citrusy
slight
bitterness
good
carbonation
but
found
this
sort
of
dull
as
a
whole
much
like
other
times
ive
tried
it
average
drinkability
d
this
was
a
good
beer
that
i
didnt
mind
at
all
in
fact
i
thought
it
was
a
lot
better
than
what
i
figured
it
was
going
to
be
anchor
which
is
the
grandfather
of
craft
beer
seems
to
still
be
in
the
game
with
this
one
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
kill
a
sixer
of
this
and
still
be
good
dhigh
low
abv
allows
for
a
really
high
drinkability
final
thoughts
well
if
you
are
on
a
boat
with
this
stuff
i
would
suggest
you
follow
the
beers
namesake
and
pitch
it
overboard
its
like
you
found
a
treasure
map
were
overjoyed
to
a
calm
sea
journey
only
to
toil
through
storms
pirates
at
great
cost
only
to
find
that
the
treasure
you
found
didnt
even
cover
the
cost
of
the
journey
disappointing
although
not
unexpected
id
have
to
say
i
knew
steam
beer
had
weird
yeast
so
maybe
its
just
not
the
style
for
me
in
conclusion
it
wont
leave
you
shanghaied
but
dont
expect
smooth
sailing
so
youll
want
to
pass
d
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
d
excellent
beer
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
lager
very
drinkable
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
very
well
put
together
its
different
and
i
like
it
after
a
disastrous
bottle
opening
by
my
wife
i
was
left
with
roughly
half
of
this
great
beer
to
savor
so
with
what
was
left
of
the
brew
it
poured
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
and
full
white
head
with
some
pretty
good
lacing
it
has
a
very
unique
aroma
a
bit
like
seawater
and
malts
mixed
in
with
some
grassy
notes
very
crisp
refreshing
taste
as
well
malty
and
sweet
up
front
sharp
hop
presence
that
hits
the
back
of
the
palate
leaving
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
with
the
mediumlight
body
low
carbonation
and
crisp
characteristics
of
the
beer
this
is
one
easy
drinking
california
common
my
go
to
summer
beer
d
i
could
definately
session
some
of
these
i
could
have
gone
for
a
deeper
hop
profile
but
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
d
always
a
good
bet
i
really
like
this
godfather
of
craft
brews
it
wont
stand
up
to
something
with
more
depth
like
a
spectacular
ipa
or
trippel
but
it
is
really
drinkable
i
like
this
one
as
an
introduction
to
what
craft
beer
should
be
d
a
favorite
of
mine
tastes
like
no
other
beer
i
know
but
still
very
drinkable
complex
but
not
obscure
d
very
drinkable
i
remember
why
i
wanted
to
brew
this
classic
beauty
now
once
more
d
very
drinkable
smooth
flavorful
and
balanced
sessionable
abv
rjt
might
be
a
beer
that
could
turn
a
macro
drinker
towards
better
beer
its
different
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
even
though
my
description
doesnt
capture
that
very
well
i
would
think
all
beer
advocates
would
want
to
give
it
a
try
at
least
once
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
nice
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
this
is
a
very
interesting
style
of
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
no
problem
smooth
light
body
beer
goes
down
quite
nicely
12
oz
into
a
snifter
pale
ale
color
with
a
decent
head
wow
what
a
wonderful
nose
just
fantastic
it
has
that
lager
funk
but
the
maltiness
and
hop
balance
of
a
pale
ale
this
beer
is
just
so
clean
it
drinks
well
preserving
the
lager
yeast
on
the
tongue
but
the
pale
ale
qualities
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
not
as
crisp
as
a
lager
more
gentle
really
a
wonderful
brew
the
california
common
my
friend
and
i
like
to
brew
a
similar
brew
to
this
in
the
fall
a
pale
ale
with
lager
yeast
fermented
at
room
temperature
and
this
was
the
beer
that
inspired
us
to
take
matters
into
our
own
hands
and
to
save
some
money
great
brew
from
anchor
cheers
always
curious
based
on
the
high
reviews
well
deserved
d
very
very
drinkable
light
and
crisp
but
not
watery
very
well
balanced
toasty
bready
front
with
a
crisp
floral
hoppy
finish
but
it
goes
back
to
a
sweet
malt
aftertaste
d
good
drinkability
but
not
something
i
have
too
often
d
this
may
be
the
perfect
session
brew
a
terrific
blend
of
malt
flavors
some
dry
some
sweet

final
notes
one
of
the
best
session
beers
you
could
have
low
in
alcohol
very
drinkable
and
tastes
great
this
beer
speaks
volumes
before
even
trying
it
and
then
lives
up
to
the
expectations
yummy
drinkable
beer
d
good
drinkability
lower
abv
good
flavor
and
balance
d
nice
drinking
beer
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
watching
football
working
outside
etc
d
all
around
a
very
solid
beer
unique
yet
familiar
anchor
steam
possess
a
nicely
balanced
kick
of
floral
hops
of
sweet
malts
which
dont
overpower
the
palate
i
could
easily
knock
down
a
couple
of
these
back
to
back
during
a
night
with
friends
solid
not
stellar
but
definitely
recommended
as
a
uniquely
drinkable
american
classic
anchor
steam
is
a
ol
standby
right
up
there
with
sierra
pale
ale
brooklyn
lager
hopdevil
etc
like
all
anchor
beers
it
is
carefully
brewed
with
great
balance
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
good
use
of
pale
malts
and
mild
hop
flavor
my
default
beer
at
phils
games
drinkability
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
sits
uncomfortable
in
my
stomach
and
i
dont
feel
like
having
another
draft
at
town
hall
tap
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
slight
1
finger
head
of
white
very
clean
aroma
with
minimal
notes
of
malt
and
grain
slight
cereal
notes
very
clean
flavor
as
well
very
easy
drinking
slight
sweet
start
that
last
throughout
minimal
bitterness
a
nice
deep
amber
color
that
starts
with
a
nice
foamy
head
about
one
fingers
worth
has
a
little
or
no
aroma
that
i
could
detect
it
does
have
bitter
beginning
but
then
finishes
smooth
judging
from
anchor
brewing
liberty
ale
which
i
really
like
a
lot
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
one
its
still
pretty
good
and
i
would
never
turn
one
away
pours
golden
bronze
nice
lasting
offwhite
head
aroma
is
sweet
malt
caramel
hops
taste
is
hops
sweet
malty
caramel
palate
is
medium
body
smooth
and
creamy
nice
carbonation
finishes
sweet
malt
and
caramel
balanced
by
slightly
bitter
hops
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
a
very
good
and
tasty
brew
over
all
a
good
sipping
beer
but
defiantly
not
something
i
would
pick
first
but
there
really
wasnt
much
wrong
with
it
just
not
my
personal
favorite
deep
yellow
with
a
reddish
hue
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
foamy
head
with
great
retention
pale
malt
and
fruity
aromas
apple
and
pear
with
hints
of
hops
and
grass
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
refreshing
carbonation
also
has
a
dry
feel
that
starts
early
and
lasts
through
the
finish
sweet
malty
flavors
combined
with
ripe
apple
and
pear
flavors
and
a
lightly
bitter
dry
finish
drinkability
overall
quite
pleasant
clean
balanced
immensely
drinkable
while
not
a
true
session
beer
this
one
can
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
everybody
can
appreciate
craft
lover
or
no
the
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
fizzy
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
of
hops
and
malt
it
smells
like
a
lager
with
some
ale
characteristics
the
taste
is
sweet
almost
grassy
like
with
hints
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
i
would
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
medium
body
a
nice
session
beer
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
not
sure
what
all
the
fuss
about
this
beer
is
tastes
bad
overpriced
no
big
fin
deal
mouth
feel
smooth
with
lite
carbination
i
had
anchor
steam
ontap
at
a
few
places
in
san
francisco
as
well
as
in
bottles
it
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
was
lightmedium
bodied
distinct
taste
and
good
drinkability
i
can
see
why
its
a
popular
beer
on
the
west
coast
overall
drinking
this
beer
is
always
a
pleasure
it
is
very
balanced
and
very
drinkable
with
enough
complexity
to
stand
out
over
other
drinkable
beers
the
fact
that
it
is
a
lager
but
is
fermented
at
ale
temps
and
agedconditioned
in
interesting
ways
definitely
adds
to
the
complexity
this
is
one
of
the
few
american
styles
of
beer
that
doesnt
just
shove
a
mouthful
of
hops
down
your
throat
that
can
be
enjoyable
and
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
it
but
anchor
steam
is
a
very
balanced
beer
that
could
stand
up
to
any
type
of
food
and
be
enjoyed
any
time
of
year
i
can
throw
these
back
like
any
good
session
beer
overall
very
good
well
balanced
and
complex
beer
i
was
impressed
by
the
aroma
that
filled
the
room
while
the
beer
was
being
poured
my
first
anchor
and
i
really
enjoy
it
shame
it
is
so
hard
to
find
in
portugal
tasty
and
worth
a
try
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
example
toget
more
hop
character
my
first
steam
beer
the
original
steam
beer
i
like
it
but
not
so
much
that
i
would
choose
it
over
a
pale
ale
i
actually
found
the
saltiness
a
little
too
much
and
wonder
whether
it
is
typical
of
other
california
commons
overall
it
was
an
interesting
and
worthwhile
drinking
experience
but
probably
not
something
id
go
back
to
not
a
bad
brew
to
go
to
if
in
need
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
especially
at
almost
3
a
bottle
pours
a
clear
bubbly
straw
amber
good
head
leaves
no
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
citrusy
floral
grass
taste
is
straw
grain
malt
a
sort
of
bland
alcohol
taste
but
a
fuller
flavour
than
any
bmc
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
chewy
drinkability
is
high
and
this
would
be
quite
sessionable
at
4
8
also
comes
in
a
cool
unique
stubby
bottle
lightmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
clean
moderate
carbonation
drinks
pretty
well
something
easily
sessioned
after
a
drought
of
california
beers
in
spain
i
stumbled
upon
a
case
of
this
gem
poured
froma
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
gave
me
some
memorable
head
about
1
5
inches
andlaced
my
glass
nice
clear
dark
golden
appearance
smell
is
subdued
malts
and
light
hops
some
bitterness
which
is
a
good
thing
and
ale
qualities
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
it
is
a
oh
so
drinkable
beer
thank
you
i
believe
ill
have
another
pours
a
transparent
light
brown
to
amber
color
with
a
dense
1
head
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
until
it
recedes
to
a
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
aroma
consists
mostly
of
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
floral
note
in
there
the
taste
is
also
heavy
on
the
malt
there
is
a
bit
of
a
caramel
malt
flavor
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
roasted
taste
to
it
also
has
a
fairly
clean
finish
that
i
like
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
pinnacle
of
its
style
but
it
isnt
something
that
i
enjoyed
enough
to
seek
out
again
the
drinkability
may
be
this
beers
strongest
attribute
though
the
price
usually
keeps
me
from
actually
doing
it
it
would
be
easy
go
through
a
sixer
in
a
single
night
seeing
as
how
this
is
one
of
the
only
good
beers
served
at
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
i
tend
to
drink
my
fair
share
of
anchor
steam
good
red
ale
has
a
copper
color
to
it
which
leaves
streaks
as
you
drink
has
a
pleasant
taste
with
its
ripe
flavor
fairly
impressed
by
the
taste
a
little
fruity
but
not
bad
i
would
recomend
it
its
not
the
best
beer
to
drink
over
and
over
but
still
worthy
of
high
marks
this
is
the
first
anchor
beer
that
i
remember
drinking
and
it
wasnt
bad
it
is
possible
that
had
it
before
but
probably
not
somber
enough
to
remember
what
it
actually
tasted
like
it
reminds
me
of
a
brown
ale
that
is
trying
to
be
a
pale
ale
but
without
the
gusto
id
like
to
try
the
liberty
and
hummer
for
comparison
does
the
lower
abv
equate
with
a
flatter
taste
overall
very
interesting
beer
in
terms
of
how
the
taste
profiles
transition
and
mesh
together
will
definitely
have
again
first
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
beautiful
appearance
in
a
glass
i
love
the
amber
color
and
the
off
white
color
of
the
head
is
very
nice
i
just
wish
the
head
had
stayed
around
a
little
longer
nice
malty
smell
not
over
powering
tastes
very
smoothe
with
a
slight
citus
or
hoppy
finish
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
this
one
poured
a
burnt
orange
in
color
with
a
billowing
and
soapy
off
white
head
its
pretty
translucent
and
is
light
bodied
the
smell
is
lightly
malty
with
little
else
other
than
some
slight
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
solid
its
very
malty
and
has
some
light
caramel
accent
to
it
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
and
is
pretty
light
and
well
carbonated
the
bubbling
stayed
active
the
entire
time
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
cant
compare
it
to
anything
else
from
the
style
i
liked
it
for
being
a
lighter
beer
but
wouldnt
necessarily
go
back
having
this
one
at
my
bud
ralphs
house
out
here
in
san
diego
poured
with
a
giant
foamy
frothy
sudsy
cream
colored
head
that
lasts
a
while
good
lacing
and
lots
of
big
bubble
trails
color
is
a
clear
orange
amber
aroma
is
burnt
sugar
caramel
malt
minerals
and
hop
with
a
bit
of
fruit
flavors
the
same
way
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
first
started
drinking
this
in
the
early
80s
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
changed
a
bit
great
beer
session
d
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
would
be
excellent
to
session
i
had
fond
memories
of
this
from
about
20
years
ago
when
i
first
set
out
from
home
but
the
truth
is
afte
comparison
to
the
many
other
choices
out
there
this
beer
just
isnt
special
to
me
anymore
sorry
just
telling
the
truth
d
a
fairly
low
alcohol
brew
with
some
good
body
and
nice
malty
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
i
came
back
to
every
couple
of
months
great
session
beer
right
here
anchor
steam
is
an
unpretentious
brew
that
tastes
great
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
orange
highlights
and
a
thick
yellowish
colored
head
and
great
lacing
smells
of
orange
peel
and
vanilla
and
some
barley
tastes
of
wonderful
barley
orange
peel
vanilla
and
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
drinkability
is
exceptional
this
is
a
great
beer
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
back
in
the
70s
and
is
still
one
of
the
best
kudos
to
anchor
for
keeping
the
same
great
taste
it
pours
well
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
hoppy
with
a
light
to
medium
body
very
crisp
dry
flavor
this
beer
never
disappoints
this
brew
is
very
easy
to
quaff
and
is
probably
the
best
new
lager
style
ive
tried
in
a
long
time
the
taste
crisp
clean
and
well
done
and
coupled
with
a
solid
mouthfeel
come
together
to
create
a
pleasing
beer
i
dont
know
if
all
california
commons
are
like
this
but
anchor
steam
beer
has
definitely
set
the
bar
high
it
has
a
pretty
simple
taste
with
mostly
biscuity
flavors
in
the
forefront
its
taste
is
overall
pretty
light
which
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
as
this
beer
is
the
example
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
a
nice
clear
orange
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
moderately
evaporating
ecru
head
the
aroma
is
of
lime
citrus
as
well
as
more
of
a
corn
syrupy
smell
along
side
of
the
general
malty
properties
that
are
seen
the
taste
is
both
nice
and
rich
in
malt
character
it
is
however
quite
abrasive
in
regards
to
the
flavor
there
is
a
lemon
rind
citrus
flavor
that
provides
both
bitter
and
astringent
properties
to
the
flavor
that
i
dont
much
care
for
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
as
the
beer
is
fairly
good
to
drink
once
you
are
able
to
get
past
the
astringent
citrus
its
an
interesting
style
not
probably
one
of
my
favorites
but
you
cant
argue
with
the
inventors
of
the
style
so
its
not
all
that
bad
beautiful
light
coppery
color
with
a
nice
very
small
bubbles
head
with
a
creamy
smooth
texture
a
breadiness
comes
out
in
the
taste
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
well
worth
getting
any
time
you
can
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
standard
brew
use
this
one
as
a
standard
for
steam
beers
this
is
very
well
balance
worth
trying
at
least
once
despite
availability
pretty
much
the
standard
for
the
style
a
classic
drinkability
at
4
9
abv
and
no
palate
stressing
flavors
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
anchor
steam
is
a
classic
american
beer
that
i
am
ashamed
for
not
having
reviewed
sooner
tonight
while
dining
with
a
friend
at
bobbys
burger
palace
i
decided
id
have
the
anchor
and
drink
it
carefully
this
steam
beer
has
a
nice
woody
minty
hop
flavor
and
aroma
the
finish
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
light
fruitiness
overall
an
average
beer
i
know
anchor
steam
did
a
lot
to
start
the
craft
beer
movement
but
now
this
beer
pales
compared
to
many
of
the
new
craft
breweries
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
it
is
just
average
there
is
not
much
to
the
aroma
it
had
a
faint
hop
smell
it
had
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
the
hops
provided
a
good
level
of
dryness
and
a
slight
bitter
pine
flavor
the
malts
lent
a
good
caramel
flavor
but
were
not
too
sweet
it
had
carbonation
level
was
more
on
the
softer
side
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
before
but
i
didnt
think
much
of
it
other
than
thinking
it
was
good
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
and
while
i
might
not
purchase
a
six
pack
i
would
defiantly
have
this
at
a
bar
this
pours
a
medium
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
halffinger
head
that
dissipates
in
time
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
on
the
nose
its
very
withdrawn
and
weak
maybe
a
slight
dried
fruit
presence
but
its
very
weak
on
the
tongue
its
an
explosion
of
flavor
compared
to
the
nose
dates
at
the
front
a
deep
sweetness
followed
by
a
lighter
citrus
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
lingering
for
a
long
while
truly
one
of
the
better
tastes
ive
experienced
and
a
total
shock
after
the
weak
nose
in
the
mouth
its
a
wide
and
shallow
feel
quite
carbonated
and
fuzzy
on
the
extremities
its
almost
too
distinctive
to
drink
one
after
another
but
it
would
be
decent
for
a
few
rich
thick
foamy
head
of
just
slightly
off
white
two
minutes
it
is
calming
down
to
a
island
in
the
middle
of
the
field
and
a
thick
clinging
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
glass
the
rich
color
of
amber
rating
a
18
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
piercing
aroma
of
barley
sweet
malt
and
roasted
wheat
sharp
and
direct
taste
of
lemon
chili
wheat
and
green
hops
clean
feeling
on
my
tongue
and
a
lingering
finish
of
lime
in
by
soft
palate
creamy
and
sharp
needles
of
fluid
on
my
gums
hard
palate
tongue
soft
palate
and
glottis
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
good
beers
and
those
that
just
try
to
make
it
in
the
world
of
beer
drinkers
most
have
little
resources
to
buy
good
beer
and
accept
the
taste
of
mass
produced
mediocre
beer
as
long
as
it
gives
them
a
buzz
that
helps
them
forget
lifes
hardships
this
beer
is
on
a
higher
level
that
delivers
great
flavor
for
a
reasonable
price
i
will
make
every
effort
to
introduce
this
fine
beer
to
my
friends
at
my
next
gathering
drink
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
highly
sessionable
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
at
the
storebar
aroma
is
hoppy
and
lightly
floral
but
gives
way
to
faint
grassy
scents
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
pretty
well
balanced
d
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
absolutely
worth
a
try
i
cannot
wait
to
try
anchor
steam
on
draft
but
ive
yet
to
find
any
in
the
midwest
that
offer
it
im
a
little
surprised
to
see
ive
never
reviewed
this
one
before
always
good
for
a
6
pack
beside
the
river
always
a
dependable
selection
for
a
day
at
sea
or
just
sitting
around
pool
side
with
your
first
mate
or
second
the
historic
popularity
of
this
beer
is
easily
fathomed
anchors
away
cheers
mateeys
its
refreshing
doesnt
taste
bad
and
is
of
average
alcohol
depending
on
what
youre
doing
you
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
not
feel
to
bad
about
things
there
are
other
beers
id
rather
have
but
these
would
do
in
a
pinch
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
ive
seen
it
around
for
9
99
tax
for
a
6pack
so
its
a
good
value
for
a
very
good
lager
d
great
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
a
great
and
true
reputation
i
pick
this
one
up
and
drink
it
every
once
in
awhile
i
have
no
other
experiences
with
steam
california
common
style
beers
so
my
preferences
may
just
be
not
geared
towards
the
style
rather
than
the
anchor
steam
itself
d
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
it
would
appear
to
be
a
go
to
beer
without
a
doubt
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
a
new
style
of
beer
for
me
hope
i
will
drink
many
more
dvery
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
early
favorites
when
i
started
drinking
beer
its
not
knocking
my
socks
off
now
and
i
fear
ive
moved
to
more
extreme
styles
leaving
this
solid
winner
behind
definitely
a
beer
id
recommend
to
someone
who
doesnt
normally
think
about
good
beer
very
accessible
d
just
great
the
original
steam
beer
sets
the
bar
so
dang
high
with
this
style
nothing
else
really
compairs
wish
a
6
pack
was
a
bit
cheaper
than
10
so
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
d
overall
and
excellent
beer
in
a
word
balance
here
we
have
a
successful
unique
brew
the
fat
bottle
the
cute
anchor
and
distinctive
bottlecap
and
amber
look
are
all
plusses
the
extremely
easy
drink
that
still
manages
to
hit
you
with
spice
and
remind
you
that
youre
sipping
a
finely
crafted
beer
not
some
alcoholic
water
multiple
bottles
dont
numb
the
tongue
to
the
wild
work
going
on
underneath
here
but
still
the
abv
should
be
higher
ahoy
steam
boys
enjoyed
this
beer
wish
he
had
a
little
more
smell
to
it
anchor
steam
as
i
have
been
told
holds
the
patent
on
the
steam
name
meaning
all
other
beers
of
this
style
must
go
by
the
california
common
label
the
owner
of
anchor
fritz
maytag
is
a
legend
in
the
brewing
world
and
this
beer
stands
as
a
gateway
for
many
craft
beer
drinkers
and
will
so
for
many
years
one
of
my
fallback
beers
i
wish
it
was
available
in
more
places
around
me
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
great
beer
cheers
a
very
easy
drinking
mildy
bitter
beer
nice
smooth
mellow
flavors
making
a
great
session
beer
its
nothing
fancy
just
a
good
honest
flavorful
beer
and
the
smooth
carbonation
really
makes
it
for
d
it
drank
very
good
and
went
well
with
cajun
calamari
and
some
cajun
gumbo
pretty
decent
a
classic
d
great
for
a
specialty
beer
would
go
well
with
or
without
food
any
time
of
day
d
with
this
balance
of
flavor
and
low
abv
very
easy
to
drink
i
only
bought
this
to
try
a
steam
beer
cant
say
ill
buy
it
again
its
a
solid
brew
really
no
flaws
to
it
but
its
really
nothing
to
seek
out
ddrinks
easily
enough
a
good
lawnmower
beer
anchor
steam
has
a
clean
copper
yellow
a
thick
head
tops
off
this
beer
its
golden
off
white
color
laces
the
glass
not
much
of
a
nose
this
disappointing
considering
its
great
appearance
it
has
some
bitterness
but
allinall
a
very
light
beer
there
is
no
after
taste
either
this
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
from
the
anchor
brewing
company
but
it
lacks
in
something
to
make
it
stand
out
against
other
beers
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
has
lots
of
flavor
im
really
surprised
the
first
anchor
i
had
really
turned
me
off
but
this
one
is
definitely
a
winner
pours
a
honeyamber
with
a
bright
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
a
very
bready
sweet
malt
starts
the
beer
off
hints
of
honey
and
caramel
as
well
toastyness
too
finishes
with
a
minor
rush
of
citrus
hops
and
some
more
faint
sweetness
nothing
big
about
the
flavor
very
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
decent
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
ok
drinkability
but
the
sweetness
got
to
me
after
a
while
perhaps
bottles
are
better
d
great
palate
cleansing
scrubbing
power
due
to
a
generous
carbonation
proved
a
great
partner
to
a
fully
loaded
mushroom
cheeseburger
the
beer
pours
and
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
with
some
grapes
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
toffee
grassy
hops
grain
and
some
metallic
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
good
for
the
style
but
this
is
a
style
i
am
not
much
of
a
fan
of
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
great
texture
and
great
body
there
is
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
in
fact
the
finish
leaves
a
taste
in
your
mouth
that
reminds
you
that
you
just
consumed
a
masterpiece
i
am
not
sure
what
characterizes
this
style
of
beer
and
distinguishes
it
from
other
styles
i
do
know
that
it
is
really
a
great
beer
poured
this
one
into
a
tulip
pours
a
deep
amber
honey
kind
of
color
with
a
big
three
finger
off
white
head
good
sticky
lacing
all
along
the
sides
the
smell
is
nice
although
im
having
a
little
trouble
pinpointing
anything
particular
citrusy
hops
definitely
some
fruitiness
to
the
nose
but
i
just
cant
seem
to
articulate
in
my
mind
exactly
what
it
is
the
taste
is
a
balance
between
some
up
front
sweetness
and
some
hop
bittering
at
the
end
im
diggin
this
and
regret
that
i
only
bought
a
single
for
me
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
strange
the
carbonation
is
kind
of
low
and
it
seems
to
dry
my
mouth
at
the
end
however
this
taste
great
and
i
could
session
this
bad
larry
all
day
great
drinking
and
probably
the
best
i
could
have
chosen
for
an
introduction
to
the
style
for
me
overall
a
fantastic
refreshing
beautiful
and
tasty
beer
grab
a
6pack
and
kickback
on
the
porch
for
a
bit
what
a
long
strange
trip
it
has
been
havent
had
this
sf
original
in
years
and
finally
got
to
cracking
one
open
tonight
i
know
packaging
isnt
everything
especially
in
the
world
of
craft
beer
but
this
bottle
and
quite
possibly
the
snpa
bottle
really
define
the
underlying
character
of
craft
beer
for
me
okay
lets
get
to
the
nittygritty
the
color
is
a
nice
copper
with
a
dense
pillowlike
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
good
while
nose
is
full
of
earthy
characters
with
a
bit
of
lemon
on
the
back
end
complementing
the
nose
the
flavors
on
this
one
are
primarily
earthy
in
nature
with
a
wellbalanced
malt
profile
and
faint
orange
rind
quality
the
body
is
very
pleasantly
round
while
finishing
pretty
clean
i
could
go
on
describing
this
beer
but
really
it
deserves
to
be
drunk
next
time
youre
out
grab
a
sixer
of
this
classic
nazdravi
the
family
resemblance
to
liberty
ale
is
unmistakeable
though
anchor
steam
of
course
doesnt
have
the
forward
hop
character
of
liberty
ale
they
share
a
lovely
mouthfeel
and
fruity
character
tried
it
on
three
seperate
days
to
be
fair
it
seemed
to
get
worse
each
time
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
faint
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
green
fruits
the
taste
has
a
nice
deep
malt
backbone
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
the
middle
and
backend
of
a
nice
little
generic
hop
bite
with
hints
of
green
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
a
little
dry
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
a
solid
beer
with
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
it
it
is
an
easy
drink
with
some
nice
flavor
to
it
im
a
little
perplexed
by
this
one
lots
of
praise
to
be
said
gorgeous
beer
in
the
glass
and
a
pleasing
smell
i
was
impressed
by
the
body
for
this
type
of
beer
however
the
damn
thing
tasted
like
soap
and
the
after
taste
was
extremely
bitter
im
a
big
fan
of
huge
ipas
and
other
very
bitter
brews
but
this
seemed
extremely
out
of
place
and
was
not
pleasant
a
bad
bottle
i
have
had
steam
anchor
before
and
remembered
it
fondly
but
i
could
barely
get
through
this
one
and
im
far
from
picky
about
different
styles
of
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
of
about
two
fingers
and
a
orangishtan
color
smells
of
some
citrus
and
bitter
pine
with
some
malts
as
well
taste
is
more
malty
and
more
piney
with
the
citrus
notes
taking
a
back
seat
feel
is
crisp
with
a
fairly
light
body
very
carbonated
good
overall
beer
nice
feel
flavor
and
aroma
with
an
average
body
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
white
head
about
two
inches
that
disippated
fairly
quickly
smell
is
malt
with
a
faint
hops
citrus
smell
the
taste
is
also
malt
with
a
faint
hops
flavor
fairly
bitter
but
not
overpoweringly
so
really
a
nice
beer
and
very
nice
after
a
hard
days
work
enjoyable
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
if
you
have
never
been
to
san
francisco
to
pier
39
its
worth
the
trip
just
to
go
to
the
anchor
steam
brewery
this
is
some
of
the
best
american
beer
on
the
market
and
criminally
underrated
the
smell
taste
and
drinkability
are
second
to
none
and
this
is
an
enjoyable
drinking
beer
perfect
for
just
about
any
occasion
well
rounded
and
not
lacking
very
very
close
to
brew
perfection
overall
fairly
well
balanced
caramel
and
pine
dominates
not
overly
impressed
considering
how
much
press
this
beer
gets
and
high
price
tag
it
is
not
refreshing
enough
to
be
an
easy
drinker
and
isnt
complex
enough
to
make
me
take
notice
this
is
a
very
misleading
beer
at
first
i
was
not
entirely
impressed
as
it
seemed
to
be
just
another
amber
style
beer
however
the
subtle
qualities
of
this
beer
are
so
nicely
in
balance
it
creates
one
heckuva
drinkable
beer
d
finishes
easy
enough
and
no
reason
not
to
enjoy
more
than
one
yet
it
is
a
mild
beer
and
one
that
left
me
wanting
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
dept
on
a
side
note
i
like
using
anchor
brewing
co
bottles
for
homebrewing
they
have
unique
nice
looking
bottles
do
its
a
classic
but
im
not
digging
it
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
for
me
give
it
a
try
and
decide
for
yourselves
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
legendary
and
arguably
noted
as
being
the
beer
that
saved
craft
beer
in
america
personally
i
find
it
hard
to
compare
to
others
in
the
style
because
i
havent
had
any
yet
will
need
to
do
more
research
on
the
hop
notes
as
they
are
the
qualities
that
separate
this
beer
from
being
a
pale
ale
this
beer
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
pale
ale
pour
is
like
that
of
an
unfiltered
lager
bit
on
the
amber
side
mild
head
that
seemed
about
right
but
not
particularly
impressive
nose
of
apricot
citrus
with
a
palate
of
a
suprising
amount
of
bitterness
interesting
quality
of
malt
and
hops
quite
herbal
bitter
with
no
quality
of
fruit
outside
of
the
nose
easydrinking
and
pleasant
overall
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
malt
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
has
caramel
malt
and
some
nice
hoppy
bitterness
to
it
medium
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
not
something
id
drink
too
many
of
at
once
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
amazing
d
its
a
good
enough
beer
but
not
one
id
care
to
drink
very
often
d
easily
put
down
and
a
great
pick
for
a
session
beer
d
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
a
great
lager
recommended
drinkability
smooth
creamy
and
enjoyable
will
i
miss
you
california
maybe
will
i
miss
your
beer
sure
but
ill
still
be
able
to
buy
it
taste
is
decidedly
malty
with
toast
and
caramel
leading
the
way
plenty
of
floral
bittering
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavoring
yeast
is
clean
but
exhibits
a
touch
of
light
fruit
maybe
some
red
apples
and
pears
freshness
is
paramount
to
this
as
some
old
anchor
steam
can
get
pretty
hairy
fresh
it
is
delightfully
pleasant
with
the
refreshing
qualities
of
a
lager
blending
nicely
with
the
subtle
complexities
an
ale
yeast
has
to
offer
nice
brew
and
a
good
example
of
classic
american
craft
beer
overall
a
very
nice
balanced
brew
along
with
a
sneaky
hop
bite
i
like
it
d
had
22oz
at
the
hotel
bar
and
enjoyed
every
last
sip
if
i
didnt
have
to
be
somewhere
i
would
have
had
another
very
enjoyable
and
glad
that
i
finally
got
to
give
this
one
a
try
in
its
home
state
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
atop
that
diminishes
quickly
leaving
no
cap
but
a
ring
around
the
edge
that
doesnt
lace
the
aromas
are
muted
with
sweet
malt
and
a
light
spicy
hop
aroma
the
beer
itself
has
a
nice
lightly
sweet
malt
backbone
with
light
bitterness
and
fruity
esters
including
apple
strong
carbonation
couples
well
with
the
light
drinking
beer
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
after
a
bike
ride
and
lawnmowing
drinkability
100
recommend
anytime
anywhere
if
your
a
beer
drinker
this
is
a
must
havetry
loved
it
taste
like
they
advertise
its
what
a
lager
yeast
made
in
an
ale
or
vice
versa
light
body
ample
hopping
for
a
flagship
brew
from
back
in
the
day
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
allows
one
to
pick
up
some
of
the
complexities
and
what
sets
this
beer
apart
from
a
standard
apa
great
summer
beer
sometimes
a
little
cost
prohibitive
and
a
well
known
folklore
regarding
the
dickness
of
those
affiliated
with
the
brewery
prevent
many
from
enjoying
the
finished
product
more
often
obviously
a
beer
of
utmost
importance
for
american
craft
brewing
anchor
steam
transcends
its
historical
value
by
being
consistently
great
tasting
and
eminently
drinkable
id
drink
it
if
it
were
the
only
thing
on
hand
but
i
dont
exactly
have
high
praise
for
this
one
d
very
good
this
can
be
a
exelent
session
for
a
hot
summer
night
drinkability
a
classic
brew
you
truly
wont
find
another
beer
like
this
that
said
it
is
also
quite
tasty
this
is
one
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
d
good
goes
down
easy
but
not
too
easy
its
been
some
time
since
chumleys
passport
thing
introduced
me
to
the
steam
so
i
figured
id
give
it
another
go
while
ck
is
celebrating
fritzs
wonderland
of
brewy
goodness
it
pours
a
clear
copperamber
with
a
thumb
of
light
offwhite
foam
on
top
the
nose
is
primarily
a
humid
melange
of
citrus
and
floral
hoppy
goodness
though
a
bit
of
medicinalsoapy
notes
stagnate
in
the
background
interestingly
the
taste
runs
along
these
same
lines
though
the
soap
is
gone
and
there
is
an
increased
influence
coming
from
the
flowery
and
cirtusy
hop
elements
and
a
very
light
twinge
of
caramel
the
body
is
light
with
active
carbonation
and
a
crsip
dry
finish
its
all
pretty
straightforward
but
nothing
all
that
desirable
cant
fault
the
drinkability
though
as
this
guy
is
light
and
refreshing
enough
to
warrant
constant
returns
to
the
steam
room
bottle
poured
a
clear
burnt

lovely
frothy

smell
of

hint
of
raisin
flavors
of
caramel
and
malt
is
nicely
balanced
with
somewhat
bitter
hops
but
hops
arent
real
noticeable
they
simply
hold
back
the
sugars
and
balance
everything
providing
a
kind
of
dry
finish
this
is
so
unique
and
very
good
i
love
this
beer
it
is
very
versitile
by
that
i
mean
it
is
hard
to
pigeonhole
into
a
category
i
think
it
could
satisfy
many
different

palates
very
well
made
and
a
classic
in
my
house

at

and

will

easy

is
a

something

this

nhad
this

in

20s
and
really
appreciate
it
now
in

this
is
a

drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
i
enjoy
trying
all
the

to

gotta

even

it

all

thin

and
plenty

smelled
ever
so
slightly
of

taste
of
the
beer
was

nice
combo
of
all
ingredients
made
for
a
thirst
quenching
beer
very
smooth
low
in
abv
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
pairs
well
with
all
types

cuisine
or
could
be
a

a
true
original
anchor
steam
poured
a
dark
gold
color
almost
no

the
smell
was
a
bit
light
with
hints
of
citrusy
hops
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
of
bitter
hops
very
crisp
hints
of
citrus
not
overly
bitter
drinkability
was
good
as
was
the
mouthfeel
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
was
very
crisp
could
be
quite
refreshing
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
im
not
sure
if
americans
cherish
anchor
brewing
as
much
as
i
do
i
am
certain
however
that
i
cant
be
speaking
solely
for
myself
when
i
say
that
finding
anchor
beer
on
the
shelves
was
one
of
the
pivotal
turning
points
in
my
beer
drinking
life
d
not
bad
on
the
drinkability
side
it
takes
a
few
sips
to
acquire
the
taste
for
it
but
it
is
actually
quite
good
it
shoots
down
the
throat
this
is
a
good
one
try
it
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
not
overwhelmingly
strong
but
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
i
could
drink
this
one
often
and
seem
to
like
it
better
from
the
bottle
than
from
the
tap
it
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
are
total
putoffs
though
at
first
it
doesnt
taste
too
bad
but
once
you
swallow
it
the
taste
is
really
off
im
not
a
big
fan
of
some
beer
that
is
beer
snob
approved
and
this
is
one
of
those
pours
a
very
rich
amber
color
with
a
nice
tight
creamy
head
that
fades
slowly
very
deep
complex
for
a
relatively
easy
drinking
beer
the
aroma
is
wonderful
sweet
malts
and
fruity
hops
very
crisp
smelling
i
get
a
small
amount
of
citrus
as
well
the
taste
is
also
exceptional
mild
carbonation
tingles
the
back
of
the
tongue
while
the
hops
dance
on
the
front
a
nice
malty
backbone
provides
a
nice
platform
for
all
of
this
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
thin
and
the
flavors
hang
around
for
a
while
on
the
palate
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
with
a
low
abv
it
makes
for
quite
a
flavorful

beer
give
it

beer
20

with

my
first
beer
review
on
here
so
bare
with
me
i
really
like
this
beer
i
now
get
it
pretty
regularly
when
i
am
looking
to
enjoy
a
beer
with
a
good
taste
i
usually
just
enjoy
this
beer
from
the
bottle
smells
pretty
good
i
think
i
have
poured
it
only
a
couple
times
and
i
have
drank
probably
50
bottles
of
it
note
this
beer
is
waaaay
better
on
tap
especially
closer
to
san
francisco
having
said
that
this
bottle
products
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
amber
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
frothy
offwhite
head
aroma
oh
boy
has
some
issues
vegetal
hits
my
right
away
with
smells
of
cook
asparagus
behind
that
was
a
decent
malt
profile
of
toasted
grains
and
some
caramel
no
hop
aroma
flavor
has
some
more
asparagus
wet
paper
cardboard
and
the
same
malt
profile
behind
all
that
such
as
in
the
aroma
medium
hop
bitterness
but
barely
any
trace
of
northern
brewer
hop
which
is
the
highlight
of
this
style
my
conclusion
is
that
this
was
from
old
stock
because
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
had
completely
faded
and
the
oxidation
but
there
are
some
brewing
issues
there
too
that
produced
the
vegetal
issues
ive
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
and
there
it
was
absolutely
delicious
shame
that
theres
packaging
issues
a
perfect
after
a
long
day
of
work
beer
this
is
truly
a
must
have
in
the
beer
world
its
so
unique
and
very
exceptional
d
tastes
good
and
goes
down
easy
its
also
not
too
filling
very
good
drinkability
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
not
as
great
as
i
was
lead
to
believe
im
not
sure
what
it
was
but
at
times
this
tasted
a
little
stale
it
actually
came
in
a
plastic
amber
bottle
so
maybe
that
affected
it
in
some
way
ill
probably
try
this
one
again
down
the
line
to
be
sure
d
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
not
overpowering
in
any
one
flavor

scents
of
citrus
fruit
seem
to
blend
very
well
with
the
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
equally
as
balanced
as
the
aroma
initial
taste
was
of
sweet
malt
followed
by
some
citrus
finished
off
by
a

lighter

beer
that
i
could
definitely
sit
with
for
a
session
beautiful
amber
color
with
one
finger
frothy
head
that
retains
and
leaves

throughout

some
malty
notes

citrusy
crisp
aromas
are
more
pleasing
to
the

taste
is

its

theres
nothing
there
that
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
overall
uninspiring
d
a
good
drinkability
becomes
easy
and
more
pleasant
to
drink
after
a
few
sips
id
absolutely
buy
this
again
this
is
a
great
session
beer
overall
drinkable
but
too
much
like
a
bmc
to
waste
the
extra
couple
of
bucks
on
for
a
sixer
simply
enjoyable
and
wholly
delightful
a
good
place
to
drop
anchor
for
awhile
plenty
of
fizzy
white
head
top
this
copper
colored
beer
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
a
bit
citrusy
some
malts
come
into
play
with
a
smooth
slightly
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
slightly
carbonated
lightmedium
bodied
and
very
pleasing
overall
an
excellent
beer
in
my
opinion
appearance
has
a
dark
golden
amber
head
with
a
generous
head
smell
is
sweet
citrus
malt
with
hop
aroma
taste
is
grainy
slight
grapefruit
bitter
good
balance
with
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
brew
but
for
me
the
hops
get
in
the
way
of
making
it
a
good
session
drinkability
is
very
big
you
can
have
many
pints
of
this
and
not
feel
full
goes
down
smooth
i
can
see
and
taste
why
this
beer
has
been
around
for
so
long
this
muchcelebrated
brew
deserves
every
bit
of
the
hype
thats
been
heaped
upon
it
over
the
years
no
matter
how
many
micros
i
try
this
classic
remains
one
my
favorites
pours
a
foggy
copper
with
thick
white
foam
and
smells
of
strong
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malts
its
extremely
flavorful
carmelly
malts
perfected
balanced
by
a
complex
fruitiness
and
powerful
hoppiness
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
and
crackles
on
the
tongue
a
hauntingly
long
finish
that
leaves
you
to
contemplate
just
what
exactly
hit
your
palate
highly
recommended
anchor
steam
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
moderately
thick
golden
beige
head
smell
is
mainly
malts
with
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
malty
but
a
good
balance
of
bitter
hops
nuts
oak
are
present
feel
is
nicely
carbonated
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
incredibly
unique
a
lot
of
grains
coming
through
very
multigrainlike
in
flavor
despite
that
there
is
a
prominent
bitterness
in
the
beer
which
actually
took
me
off
guard
leaves
a
sweet
flavor
on
the
tongue
yet
a
lot
of
residual
bitterness
as
well
quite
unique
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
that
pproduced
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
and
produces
excellent
lacing
as
i
drink
tastes
of
hop
bitterness
with
a
malty
backround
tastes
somewhat
caramely
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
with
outstanding
taste
this
is
a
prime
example
of
a
steam
beer
very
good
drinkability
definatly
drinking
this
alot
more
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
aides
the
drinkability
yet
this
is
a
smooth
beer
a
little
mellow
on
the
taste
but
im
tasting
some
corny
mealy
taste
with
a
slight
hop
bite
on
the
finish
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
cheerios
not
too
bad
a
beer
anchor
does
well
with
most
anything
they
put
out
recommend
beers
like
this
are
great
relaxation
beers
this
is
a
great
overall
beer
and
as
good
as
i
remember
it
md
a
little
thin
overall
very
sessionable
ill
go
back
for
more
at
some
point
m
not
one
of
the
more
popular
styles
but
i
picked
up
a
6pack
because
my
entire
beer
cellar
consists
of
mostly
heavy
high
octane
beers
i
was
searching
for
something
lighter
and
different
and
this
does
the
trick
golden
in
color
fluffy
head
if
you
pour
hard
enough
but
it
fades
fast
smells
like
malt
grass
some
caramel
crisp
clean
tasting
more
grasshay
some
kind
of
earthy
hop
highly
carbonated
can
be
a
little
too
much
at
times
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
great
truly
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
honed
for
decades
for
just
that
purpose
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
session
beers
pretty
good
session
beer
on
tap
at
the
bjs
restaurant
and
brewhouse
in
torrance
ca
aroma
is
lisghtly
spicy
hoppy
with
some
maltiness
in
there
an
amber
color
that
is
crystal
clear
and
very
little
head
flavor
is
toasty
biscuity
and
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
some
woody
spicy
notes
from
the
hops
balanced
and
a
dry
finish
very
drinkable
complexity
comes
out
when
it
warms
a
little
good
refreshing
beer
makes
me
want
to
have
another
its
hard
for
me
to
criticize
this
beer
its
so
tastey
and
well
balanced
d
this
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
it
tastes
great
and
goes
down
easy
its
also
not
too
filling
very
good
drinkability
md
clean
dry
feel
that
is
easy
to
drink
d
suprinsingly
adictive
and
very
drinkable
sweet
tasing
beer
instant
favorite
this
beer
poured
brown
with
some
orange
highlights
and
a
singlefinger
head
that
lingered
the
smell
is
mostly
malt
with
some
yeast
and
spices
the
taste
starts
right
off
with
a
combination
of
malt
and
hops
that
lingers
on
the
palate
with
some
spiciness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
although
the
hops
may
turn
some
people
off
probably
the
most
famous
version
of
the
style
and
definitely
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
medium
bodied
some
zip
in
the
swallow
good
quaff
if
you
like
the
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
with
a
bit
of
a
malty
flavor
look
no
further
nice
aroma
and
a
solid
flavor
d
excellent
this
is
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
these
drinkability
a
great
beer
nothing
very
drinkable
but
unlike
anything
i
know
on
the
market
d
this
steam
beer
was
great
it
is
good
to
see
this
hybrid
flagship
of
the
anchor
beer
is
as
great
as
billed
making
this
a
very
sessionable
beer
solid
but
unspectacular
beer
good
nose
mouthfeel
is
good
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
but
crisp
and
refreshing
without
tasting
too
watery
some
citric
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
slight
soapy
taste
which
is
odd
balanced
beer
but
i
probably
wont
try
it
again
d
very
good
drinkability
overall
it
was
a
different
style
of
beer
and
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
was
going
to
like
it
i
ended
up
enjoying
this
beer
pours
amber
with
a
medium
white
head
corny
bready
aroma
with
a
fair
amount
of
malt
astringent
metal
and
bread
dough
taste
that
has
been
watered
down
the
hops
dont
do
much
in
terms
of
adding
or
detreacting
from
the
beer
sorry
this
one
is
overhyped
and
watery
3

had
2
to
get
a
feel
for
it
but
could
have
easily
kept
going
drinks
very
easy
great
steam
beer
d
very
drinkable
distinct
taste
definitely
something
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
easy
drinking
a
classic
steam
beer
one
of
my
favorites
i
come
back
to
it
frequently
d
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
beer
ever
i
hope
to
drink
this
beer
my
entire
lifetime
and
the
next
my
expectations
where
met
a
pretty
average
beer
in
my
book
nothing
special
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
reminds
me
of
another
ive
had
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
is
very
distinct
and
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
already
a
nice
beer
though
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
its
probably
the
best
notes
from
112107
drinkability
is
very
high
always
a
favorite
with
food
its
high
availability
on
the
west
coast
makes
it
one
that
i
go
to
often
when
traveling
on
business
legendary
beer
with
a
taste
to
match
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
sour
with
bread
like
malt
and
hops
this
beer
is
clean
tasting
with
a
floral
hop
and
has
the
distinct
california
common
taste
i
believe
that
for
this
beer
less
is
more
its
not
complex
but
its
good
try
this
one
with
sour
dough
and
beef
stew
it
seems
to
match
with
them
well
gc
d
infinitely
great
intro
to
serious
beer
drinker
for
an
amateur
m
d
a
very
nice
approachable
and
certainly
sessionable
beer
a
great
full
flavour
and
medium
body
with
just
the
right
carbonation
this
is
something
ive
passed
over
far
too
long
and
so
some
catching
up
may
be
in
order
this
is
a
beer
i
had
been
looking
for
for
a
while
now
and
i
happened
to
stumble
upon
it
at
a
kroger
in
roanoke
va
i
picked
it
up
and
it
was
better
than
i
expected
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
brews
this
could
be
enjoyed
by
both
beer
geeks
and
newbies
alike
d
the
bottle
version
allows
better
temperature
control
and
thus
better
appreciation
of
the
malty
complexity
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
drinkability
is
great
not
going
to
do
the
whole
rundown
on
this
one
sorry
just
an
adequate
but
unimpressive
beer
that
gets
lost
among
the
array
of
far
superior
choices
at
hitime
or
bevmo
boring
pour
me
a
proper
pint
e
g
a
fullers
1845
any
day
of
the
week
pours
an
amber
red
colored
body
with
a
big
white
head
that
is
somewhat
diminishing
an
aroma
of
malts
with
some
hops
but
not
very
much
aroma
overall
a
bitter
taste
maltiness
and
some
sourness
not
very
fizzy
eh
though
i
would
like
to
try
a
couple
more
in
this
style
before
i
judge
based
on
just
this
one
beer
mdenh
on
the
mouthfeela
bit
biting
and
rocky
not
as
chewy
as
i
would
expect
but
not
in
the
least
watery
either
the
drinkability
is
unreali
noticed
one
advocate
reviewed
this
out
of
a
can
if
i
could
get
cans
of
this
and
california
dreaming
weather
youd
have
me
setting
sail
for
the
western
skies
in
no
time
glad
i
finally
got
to
taste
this
banjo
of
a
beeri
e
a
uniquely
american
contribution
to
the
realm
serving
type
bottle
i
used
to
like
this
beer
but
i
bought
a
bottle
yesterday
and
it
didnt
impress
color
was
a
weak
copper
with
no
head
no
lacing
smelled
mildly
of
malt
and
taste
was
the
problem
malt
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
trace
of
vinegary
aftertaste
that
ruined
the
whole
experience
i
made
it
through
the
glass
but
really
didnt
enjoy
it
pours
a
orange
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
fast
smells
sweet
and
alcoholic
sweet
malts
in
there
somewhere
tastes
the
same
as
the
smell
sweet
up
front
and
sweet
in
the
finish
no
bite
or
bitterness
it
goes
down
well
and
in
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
just
a
solid
all
around
good
beer
try
it
at
least
if
you
can
this
is
a
solid
but
largely
unexceptional
brew
i
might
pick
up
a
sixer
if
it
was
on
sale
but
there
are
a
ton
of
equally
priced
brews
that
i
like
more
cheers
refreshing
and
highly
sessionable
quite
a
superb
session
beer
with
the
overt
qualities
of
an
ale
and
the
underlying
crisp
refreshing
nature
of
a
lager
an
outstanding
classic
truly
a
classic
nothing
else
quite
like
it
as
excellent
and
intriguing
today
as
it
was
30
some
years
ago
when
i
first
tried
it
d
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
one
of
my
faves
only
complaint
is
high
cost
of
six
pack
here
in
texas
poured
into
a
tumbler
copper
orange
color
with
a
big
billowing
head
that
become
dense
and
rocky
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
of
caramel
some
floral
notes
slightly
perfumey
taste
of
lightly
toasted
grains
semisweet
hints
of
caramel
bready
and
dry
on
the
finish
only
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
can
be
detected
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
a
very
nice
lager
a
wonderful
session
beer
it
was
a
good
looking
brew
with
an
amber
color
and
a
12
finger
foam
head
with
some
wintery
lacing
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
fruity
smell
the
taste
was
creamy
and
bitter
from
the
get
go
and
had
a
caramel
apple
finish
the
mouth
feel
was
well
carbonated
and
left
some
fruity
bitterness
on
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
overall
this
is
one
that
needs
to
be
bought
more
often
overall
steam
is
a
real
treat
pick
it
up
and
enjoy
this
is
a
great
beer
it
will
probably
not
be
long
before
i
pick
up
more
its
balanced
flavors
make
it
very
versatile
when
pairing
it
with
food
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
with
lebanese
food
aged
white
cheddar
mac
and
cheese
and
more
my
drinkability
score
is
hurt
a
bit
by
its
usual
price
of
nearly
ten
bucks
a
sixer
around
here
when
its
on
sale
its
a
great
bargain
for
a
fabulous
beer
plus
its
a
lager
props
to
anchor
for
crafting
a
classic
out
of
the
box
brew
one
of
my
favorite
craft
beers
that
is
widley
available
always
a
good
purchase
it
is
an
exceptionally
tasty
wheat
with
just
a
bite
of
hops
and
an
incredible
ability
to
quench
ones
thirst
it
has
nice
citrusy
finish
and
looks
hazy
orange
in
the
glass
opaque
try
their
liberty
ale
as
well
if
you
have
the
chance
always
saw
this
in
the
package
store
and
finally
got
around
to
giving
it
a
whirl
i
was
curious
to
see
how
a
brewery
invented
its
own
style
of
beer
basically
and
man
this
shit
is
good
its
one
of
the
most
crisp
and
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
theres
also
this
nice
fruity
character
about
and
it
is
extremely
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
wish
my
store
carried
more
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
microbrew
legend
tasty
and
unique
though
this
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
anchor
beers
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
and
something
i
would
recommend
this
beer
looks
and
smells
good
and
keeps
getting
better
from
there
d
easy
to
have
a
sixer
of
these
great
session
brew
especially
during
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
easily
drinkable
and
readily
available
beer
that
i
need
to
stop
neglecting
the
taste
is
similar
being
restrained
but
flavourful
and
fairly
fullbodied
its
well
balanced
and
has
lightly
sweet
caramel
toasted
grain
balanced
with
mild
citrusyleafy
hop
bitterness
with
lemon
and
bitter
leaves
its
fullbodied
yet
light
crisp
and
asy
to
drink
pretty
drinkable
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
for
sure
d
4
this
is
a
good
session
beer
one
to
enjoy
many
through
the
course
of
a
night
with
friends
overall
this
is
quite
the
beer
i
have
never
had
a
steam
beer
but
i
do
like
it
i
am
more
of
a
dark
beer
drinker
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
session
beer
i
had
tried
this
a
few
years
ago
and
tried
it
again
on
the
recommendation
of
a
fellow
ba
thanks
dkb
who
says
its
one
of
his
favorites
it
was
like
trying
it
again
for
the
first
time
beautiful
orange
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
healthy
almost
decadent
head
of
foam
that
lingered
through
the
first
few
sips
and
laced
the
glass
malty
nose
but
the
initial
taste
was
a
nice
balanced
malt
and
fruity
hops
that
added
a
whole
bunch
of
tastes
to
the
mix
not
cloying
not
too
bitter
and
definitely
very
drinkable
a
bit
of
astringent
in
the
aftertaste
but
nothing
to
detract
from
the
flavor
loved
it
i
understand
the
attraction
this
is
a
decent
midmajor
its
clean
and
doesnt
drink
too
badly
better
than
most
sessionable
drinkability
paired
quite
well
with
the
film
karate
kid
playing
in
the
background
a
fine
drinkable
brew
all
around
that
appeals
to
my
session
beer
sensibilities
d
not
great
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
an
ample
dose
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
find
myself
enjoying
several
great
segueway
into
the
fall
as
it
is
a
slightly
sweeter
tasting
beer
but
doesnt
hit
as
hard
as
some
of
the
malt
bombs
that
come
with
the
fall
had
another
one
this
year
and
body
was
a
bit
thicker
than
recalled
taste
a
little
sweeter
really
good
beer
taste
is
very
well
balanced
bready
malt
and
hops
in
harmonious
accord
its
a
beautiful
thing
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
bite
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
had
it
with
pizza
and
the
two
went
wonderfully
together
really
my
criticisms
or
evaluation
of
this
beer
are
almost
beside
the
point
its
an
institution
its
an
innovator
its
a
classic
its
great
for
beginners
its
practically
sessionable
its
important
its
fucking
delicious
i
would
definitely
love
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
because
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
a
very
solid
brew
d
interesting
beer
and
a
nice
change
up
d
very
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
one
again
originally
sampled
from
the
bottle
and
now
sampled
on
draft
5908
good
beer
i
like
it
better
now
than
i
did
when
i
first
sampled
it
amber
colored
with
a
nice
khaki
head
which
leaves
some
nice
lacing
some
sweet
caramel
malts
in
the
aroma
with
some
fruity
spice
the
flavor
starts
off
with
carmel
malts
but
it
is
also
nicely
hopped
making
it
pretty
well
balanced
id
get
it
again
d
i
could
pair
this
with
any
bbq
and
great
summertime
sessions
the
diamond
of
this
mixed
6
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
a
fantastic
standard
and
nofail
fallback
it
is
actually
hard
not
to
grab
a
6
of
these
notes
my
impression
is
that
if
you
stumbled
upon
this
in
san
fran
on
tap
that
it
would
be
a
great
find
along
with
the
ambience
and
what
not
a
good
drinking
beer
and
a
great
alternative
to
mass
market
beers
for
sure
a
very
nice
beer
i
wish
i
hadnt
had
those
others
before
it
though
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
its
really
quite
good
it
might
be
the
color
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
reminds
me
of
autumn
i
could
see
this
being
very
sessionable
this
coming
season
reminded
me
a
alaskan
amber
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
i
will
be
getting
more
anchor
steam
a
solid
beer
that
is
a
great
drink
on
a
hot
houston
afternoon
if
i
were
blindfolded
id
presume
this
to
be
a
typical
apa
i
imagine
the
uninitiated
wouldnt
realize
that
they
were
drinking
the
most
original
of
american
beersthe
first
of
our
own
poured
to
a
good
head
that
lasted
a
while
head
was
slightly
off
white
also
had
some
lacing
poured
gold
in
color
smelled
very
light
maybe
a
little
malt
tasted
very
light
also
some
citrus
and
hops
then
again
very
light
tasting
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
felt
good
in
the
mouth
i
thought
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
i
will
buy
these
again
on
occasion
i
just
wouldnt
want
to
make
this
a
session
beer
this
was
my
first
steam
brew
ever
it
had
a
pleasing
dark
golden
hue
to
it
the
taste
was
clearly
lagerish
as
it
should
be
but
without
a
doubt
had
a
leg
up
on
your
standard
lager
it
had
a
healthy
kick
of
hops
and
finished
rather
clean
not
a
bad
beer
an
absolute
fridge
staple
drinkability
is
very
good
anchor
steam
is
a
classic
tasty
and
very
sessionable
beer
everytime
i
get
some
i
wonder
why
i
dont
grab
this
beer
more
often
very
good
stuff
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
bought
this
therefore
i
had
no
expectations
pours
a
nice
orangeamber
with
a
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
duration
minimal
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
and
a
slow
but
steady
stream
of
carbonation
is
present
this
beer
is
extremely
aromatic
primarily
consisting
of
sweet
malts
the
aroma
is
absolutely
wonderful
the
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
and
even
a
bit
hoppy
there
is
a
good
balance
present
in
this
beer
and
makes
for
an
enjoyable
experience
the
more
i
try
this
the
more
i
like
it
creamy
and
full
on
the
palate
with
a
smooth
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
could
easily
enjoy
in
any
setting
anchor
steam
beer
is
an
amber
mahogany
syrup
in
a
glass
the
smell
isnt
that
strong
but
satisfying
the
taste
is
one
of
malty
grain
and
vegetables
but
kids
dont
beware
it
still
tastes
great
carbonation
attacks
the
tongue
but
the
aftertaste
is
where
the
goodness
lies
and
where
you
can
tell
much
about
a
beer
this
brew
has
a
deep
mahogany
taste
that
can
satisfy
the
drinker
that
is
looking
for
an
in
between
lager
and
porter
beer
this
beer
is
a
great
fall
season
beer
that
equips
you
for
making
the
transition
between
light
sweet
brews
and
bitter
heavy
ones
its
an
amberorange
color
with
a
very
nice
looking
3
fingered

light
some

sto
go
with
a
little

hop
and
bready
malt
taste
has
a
nice
bitterness
and
decent
malt
backdrop
the
mouth
feel
could
be
a
little
heavier
for
me
its
medlight
very
drinkable
and
overall
refreshing
beer
its
easy
to
see
why
its
been
around
for
so
long
the
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
big
offwhite
head
head
a
pleasant
aroma
consisting
of
fruity
caramel
malt
character
with
a
slight
whiff
of
hops
the
bitterness
of
the
attacks
the
palate
quickly
but
then
retreats
allowing
the
malt
to
come
through
with
caramel
fruit
and
a
bit
of
sugar
the
beer
leaves
the
palate
dry
with
lingering
bitterness
this
is
a
good
classic
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
12oz
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
translucent
amberred
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smells
malty
with
nuttiness
fruitiness
and
caramel
tastes
sweet
and
fruity
with
caramel
biscuit
nut
somewhat
aqueous
with
effervescent
carbonation
making
this
one
a
superdrinkable
refreshing
beer
a
classic
for
sure
and
for
good
reason
unfortunately
at
the
current
price
on
the
other
side
of
the
country
from
the
brewery
this
will
only
be
an
occasional
treat
translucent
amber
with
generous
white
head
nose
is
hop
citrus
lemon
and
very
metallic
overall
a
malt
focus
on
the
palate
with
caramel
very
smooth
body
and
the
hops
have
a
dry
grassearth
character
that
is
what
reminds
me
of
this
beer
every
time
finish
is
dry
crisp
refreshing
drinkability
is
over
the
top
a
solid
beer
the
anchor
steam
ive
always
been
a
fan
its
not
fancy
and
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
or
anything
but
its
a
consistently
fine
beer
id
say
this
sets
the
bar
for
steam
beer
but
its
the
only
one
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
still
its
a
fine
example
of
an
underused
brew
in
my
opinion
a
great
session
beer
too
at
4
9
abv
md
compared
with
the
draught
version
the
bottled
one
fares
slightly
lower
due
to
the
slightly
more
coarse
fizziness
and
also
a
thinner
body
but
the
trademark
flavour
profile
stays
intact
a
bittersweet
session
beer
designed
to
quaff
that
sweetness
continues
on
the
palate
and
has
a
back
palate
similar
to
a
mild
english
ale
but
its
sweet
and
almost
like
a
waffle
or
something
maybe
its
because
id
always
imagined
a
steam
beer
would
taste
like
a
waffle
for
some
reason
the
palate
kind
of
folds
over
and
well
i
dont
know
its
unique
lots
to
like
though
and
yeah
i
quite
enjoy
drinking
this
pleasant
and
unique
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
classic
golden
brownamber
color
and
a
good
head
that
stuck
around
slightly
hoppy
maybe
with
a
hint
of
toast
or
nut
also
a
pleasant
dry
bite
with
very
slight
bitterness
aroma
is
very
fresh
and
pleasant
reminds
me
a
little
of
an
esb
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
and
full
but
not
heavy
really
pleasant
very
drinkable
beer
its
the
sort
of
beer
that
makes
its
way
by
pure
quality
not
by
being
something
extreme
next
time
i
myself
am
in
san
francisco
ill
be
picking
up
a
couple
more
of
these
for
sure
the
beer
settled
with
a
murky
amber
appearance
and
a
generally
thin
but
creamy
head
i
sensed
a
slice
spice
ingredient
to
the
beer
but
generally
had
fruity
and
hoppy
characteristics
taste
had
a
mostly
bitter
punch
to
it
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
not
enough
to
call
it
a
balanced
bittersweetness
i
enjoyed
the
carbonation
the
most
as
the
mouthfeel
made
this
really
refreshing
and
light
overall
a
decent
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
takes
the
best
of
a
lager
and
adds
some
of
the
goodness
of
an
ale
something
is
strangely
likeable
about
this
beer
that
i
cant
quite
articulate
i
crave
it
when
making
pizza
makes
for
nice
summer
drinking
as
well
notes
a
classic
west
coast
session
beer
great
stuff
a
unique
beer
thats
hard
to
compare
with
anything
else
ive
had
goldamber
in
color
with
a
nice
uneven
head
smells
of
crystalcaramel
malts
with
a
slight
flowerysweetness
overall
first
impression
is
malty
but
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
that
maintains
an
almost
perfect
balance
an
underlying
fruity
character
fades
in
and
out
very
smooth
and
drinkable
nothing
in
particular
jumps
out
and
grabs
you
just
an
overall
solid
and
pleasant
beer
the
low
abv
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
as
well
great
on
tap
had
this
with
oysters
smooth
easydrinking
session
beer
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
this
is
the
quintessential
goto
west
coast
beer
even
more
than
postrunners
such
as
sierra
nevada
and
stone
overall
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
this
could
be
the
best
beer
made
in
america
d
not
bad
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
bottle
of
beer
my
first
steam
beer
im
happy
i
tried
but
definately
a
one
and
done
d
overall
some
smooth
toasted
caramel
malting
but
more
of
a
tweener
good
for
one
or
two
but
fails
to
satisfy
in
numbers
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
smooth
and
refreshing
much
like
the
rest
of
the
anchor
lineup
very
drinkable
more
flavor
than
one
would
expect
for
4
9
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
hoppy
up
front
and
finishing
with
well
balance
light
malts
as
the
beer
warms
the
finish
becomes
more
complex
and
bready
yet
not
overpowering
feel
is
good
better
than
initially
expected
given
the
perceived
high
carbonation
finish
and
drinkability
are
solid
just
realizing
that
the
turn
towards
a
bready
finish
may
be
related
to
the
reduced
carbonation
as
well
as
the
warming
temperature
i
guess
further
study
is
indicated
just
a
great
stlye
of
beer
and
this
is
the
flagship
brew
for
the
style
amazing
how
it
continues
to
set
itself
apart
from
the
massive
pantheon
of
craft
beers
these
days
a
classic
i
hadnt
had
one
of
these
in
years
pours
a
clear
med
copper
color
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
chalice
not
a
strong
smell
steely
malts
some
hints
of
caramel
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
vinous
fruity
alcohol
present
as
well
a
crisp
malty
flavor
cereal
grains
and
toasty
caramel
well
balanced
w
hop
bitterness
some
nuts
dark
fruits
and
metalmineral
in
the
mix
a
rather
rich
feeling
lightmed
body
for
such
a
small
beer
coupled
w
the
decent
amount
of
co2
makes
for
a
creamy
texture
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
here
im
surprised
the
style
is
not
more
popular
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
amazing
beer
but
drinkability
for
me
is
dependent
on
season
i
would
drink
this
all
summer
long
and
although
anchor
has
a
summer
beer
this
is
much
better
and
should
be
considered
highly
ill
be
buying
alot
more
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
standard
goto
beers
for
consistent
enjoyment
particularly
in
these
warmer
months
california
common
beers
are
very
unique
to
each
brewer
enjoy
tasting
the
differentiating
qualities
and
nuances
from
one
variant
to
the
next
this
beer
also
happens
to
be
7
on
the
list
of
most
preppy
beers
according
to
tipsy
in
madras
the
essential
guide
to
80s
preppy
drinking
overall
what
a
brew
wickedly
drinkable
and
totally
worth
checking
out
recommended
for
sure
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
session
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
pretty
light
worth
trying
overall
i
thought
this
was
outstanding
really
a
great
session
beer
and
the
epitome
of
the
style
you
really
cannot
get
better
then
this
it
really
has
a
world
of
good
coming
out
of
that
bottle
and
there
is
really
just
no
way
you
can
go
wrong
wit
this
one
in
any
way
deep
orange
colour
with
some
fluffy
sticky
head
offwhite
in
colour
smells
of
sweet
caramel
earth
grains
with
some
light
citrus
odours
taste
is
creamy
caramel
mixing
into
bitter
citrus
grains
grass
slightly
drying
finish
carbonation
fizzes
in
the
mouth
with
some
bitter
tingling
to
finish
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
tasty
refreshing
and
i
definitely
want
another
thanks
to
mattt
for
the
bottle
very
boring
beer
from
a
great
brewery
d
a
decent
beer
and
one
that
you
end
up
having
a
lot
if
you
live
in
the
bay
area
good
on
a
warm
san
fran
summer
day
which
there
arent
really
that
many
of
unfortunately
silky
smooth
and
substantial
excellent
creamy
character
wellbalanced
wonderfully
tasty
earthy
and
perfectly
refreshing
this
is
the
prototype
for
the
style
for
a
reason
its
good
palate
is
too
sweet
for
my
taste
thankfully
it
is
malty
sweetness
not
artificial
in
any
sense
tons
of
residual
sugar
here
feel
is
nice
and
full
too
which
is
a
bit
of
an
intense
combination
for
a
lager
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
remarkably
astringent
earthy
notes
and
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
clean
it
up
chalky
bready
a
bit
salty
too
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
a
good
crisp
clean
beer
tastes
of
fruits
hop
bitterness
and
lightly
roasted
malts
another
great
beer
from
anchor
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
deep
reddish
amber
with
a
big
2
inch
head
that
melted
into
a
thin
layer
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
anchor
steam
also
left
just
a
slight
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
first
aroma
roasted
malts
and
caramel
come
out
then
hints
of
biscuits
and
just
a
smidge
of
hops
come
out
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
toffee
up
front
with
slight
notes
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
the
finish
is
just
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
its
really
carbonated
but
has
a
very
clean
and
dry
finish
this
is
a
great
session
beer
when
you
want
something
a
little
fuller
than
things
that
are
fizzy
and
yellow
theres
something
about
anchor
steam
that
makes
me
view
it
as
the
working
mans
craft
beer
its
certainly
the
type
of
drink
i
want
on
hand
after
a
hard
day
because
its
clean
refreshing
and
unchallenging
the
flavours
will
certainly
not
blow
people
away
but
its
the
kind
of
sessionable
beer
i
think
we
need
a
lot
more
of
i
dont
really
feel
like
talking
about
the
individual
qualities
of
this
beer
its
a
delicious
beer
of
an
authentic
original
american
style
its
hoppy
and
satisfying
yet
light
and
thirst
quenching
spicy
and
a
little
fruity
yet
also
clean
and
crisp
a
classic
and
something
i
can
drink
almost
all
the
time
if
youre
reading
this
and
havent
tried
it
yet
do
it
somewhat
muted
coppery
color
always
a
decent
head
on
top
nice
moderate
amount
of
hop
aroma
has
that
certain
bite
to
it
crisp
flavor
with
a
good
bit
of
hop
bitterness
some
residual
malty
sweetness
great
bodyvery
full
the
full
flavor
somewhat
lends
itself
to
the
body
very
drinkable
and
always
enjoyable
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
got
into
get
it
fresh
i
have
had
some
that
has
been
laying
around
and
it
isnt
pretty
american
classic
for
sure
notes
its
late
and
i
have
had
enough
of
this
beer
to
let
you
know
that
it
is
not
only
above
averagebut
well
worth
the
time
and
money
a
session
beer
and
a
delight
on
any
day
regardless
of
the
temperature
so
well
balanced
and
nice
bitter
finish
that
goes
so
well
with
the
caramel
notes
go
out
and
try
one
certainly
not
my
style
at
all
smells
of
some
sweetness
and
soap
very
malty
with
weird
lageresque
taste
predominant
similar
to
kolsch
styles
contrary
to
some
i
didnt
think
immediately
of
an
ale
definitely
not
the
smoothest
or
most
likable
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
great
on
this
beer
the
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
is
almost
perfect
and
the
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
it
go
right
down
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
23
2008
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
medium
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
was
citrusy
hops
and
some
sweetish
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
well
carbonated
the
flavour
was
very
hoppy
leaving
a
bitterness
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
a
little
sour
apple
taste
interesting
and
flavorful
this
is
your
average
american
lager
only
it
does
everything
better
than
your
average
american
lager
d
i
might
have
a
few
of
these
but
the
only
memorable
aspect
of
this
beer
is
its
aroma
the
taste
isnt
all
that
interesting
and
for
the
price
i
definitely
wouldnt
choose
this
as
a
session
beer
its
not
that
good
md
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
easy
to
go
down
very
nice
beer
much
better
then
i
remembered
it
glad
i
picked
it
up
again
you
just
gotta
give
it
up
for
the
true
american
beer
a
classic
micro
that
is
a
good
place
to
start
for
a
newbie
like
myself
i
will
come
back
to
this
from
time
to
time
because
it
is
so
good
and
so
unique
d
easy
to
drink
any
time
of
year
very
tasty
and
worth
drinking
slightly
cloudy
dark
amber
out
of
a
stubby
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
in
a
flash
smelled
of
subtle
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
think
pilsner
at
a
bakery
rotund
sweet
taste
chewy
and
thick
finished
with
a
very
bitter
lipsmacking
citrus
bite
a
bit
dry
for
my
taste
and
the
flavors
lingered
about
a
second
longer
than
the
head
a
nice
looking
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
nice
candy
malts
and
some
faint
hops
taste
has
soem
good
citrus
hops
up
front
with
a
malty
finish
nothing
special
but
good
for
the
style
nice
crisp
medium
body
creates
a
nice
palate
a
drinkable
beer
but
a
bit
over
priced
out
here
in
colorado
im
sure
its
more
reasonable
back
in
cali
nice
job
anchor
notes
this
is
quite
a
unique
style
nicely
drinkable
as
well
cheers
mouthfeeldrinkability
smooth
and
easy
this
is
an
effortless
beer
from
the
lips
to
the
gullet
its
raw
character
leaning
more
on
the
grains
and
malts
than
hops
positions
this
as
a
stellar
food
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
steak
chicken
or
even
vegetarian
dishes
ill
probably
look
elsewhere
for
a
drink
when
the
warm
weather
hits
but
this
strikes
me
as
a
pretty
great
springtime
beer
its
got
some
hints
of
summer
but
enough
body
to
fight
through
the
last
throes
of
winter
ooverall
i
actually
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
maybe
didnt
live
up
to
a
lot
of
the
hype
i
heard
but
still
enjoyable
verdict
this
beer
easily
earns
its
status
as
an
absolute
legend
by
being
both
crucial
to
the
revival
of
american
beer
and
downright
delicious
we
owe
this
beer
a
lot
buy
some
and
enjoy
a
few
pints
of
your
history
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
nice
lace
a
head
the
smell
has
many
of
aromas
of
adjuncts
but
also
slightly
fruity
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
leaves
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
taste
is
very
malty
but
bitter
with
a
hint
of
apple
fruitiness
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
bad
to
have
once
in
a
while
classic
brewery
classic
style
classic
beer
always
a
great
goto
brew
d
a
fine
hybrid
beer
more
ale
like
i
appreciate
the
historic
relevance
of
this
specimen
to
the
american
brewing
landscape
this
is
one
i
welcome
to
my
lips
w
a
great
hop
and
malt
balance
pale
ale
in
some
repsects
yet
steam
beer
deserves
a
category
all
its
own
there
is
fruit
and
woody
earthy
flavor
but
the
finish
is
clean
and
this
one
goes
down
refreshingly
easy
i
already
mentioned
i
had
three
but
for
a
buck
a
bottle
at
a
place
that
has
a
decent
selection
locally
i
couldnt
resist
kudos
to
fritz
maytag
for
reviving
anchor
and
keeping
this
style
alive
d
nice
beer
that
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
i
think
this
would
be
good
with
many
different
kinds
of
food
im
actually
surprised
at
myself
for
waiting
so
long
to
review
this
beer
as
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
anchor
anyhow
the
good
stuff
nice
copperred
hue
hefty
body
on
the
lager
good
carbonation
soft
fruity
cereal
notes
on
the
nose
medium
viscosity
for
a
lager
a
bit
heavier
on
the
palate
than
one
would
expect
on
first
try
a
spiked
dry
creaminess
on
the
finish
good
beer
poured
a
dark
gold
body
with
some
decent
head
and
lacings
a
rather
simple
smell
dry
and
hoppy
with
some
airiness
to
it
a
smooth
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
hop
kick
to
it
but
also
some
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
to
it
the
malts
and
sweetness
caramelhoney
dominate
the
tongue
and
the
hops
hit
for
a
dryer
but
not
overpowering
backbite
simplistic
maybe
but
still
a
nice
beer
to
relax
with
while
sitting
at
a
bar
on
the
beach
poors
amberred
smells
of
grain
husk
and
some
earthy
spiciness
fairly
clean
though
tastes
very
crisp
clean
and
somewhat
refreshing
nothing
spectacular
but
easy
to
drink
ill
happily
have
another
had
this
on
tap
the
othernight
at
strangebrew
in
nh
910
reviews
as
of
this
writing
so
ill
go
with
a
slightly
different
angle
than
usual
this
is
a
classic
and
good
choice
most
anytime
maybe
my
taste
buds
have
changed
or
this
was
not
the
freshest
tapline
but
id
swear
it
was
hoppier
in
the
past
regardless
it
was
a
great
choice
at
the
pub
almost
no
foam
as
i
pour
it
into
the
glass
reddish
brown
colour
smells
like
caramel
and
nuts
and
the
smell
is
nice
and
powerful
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
i
can
taste
some
sweet
caramel
and
then
there
are
bitter
hops
to
keep
things
balanced
a
really
nice
brew
gets
better
when
it
warms
recommended
d
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
but
the
intense
bitterness
severely
limits
the
drinkability
for
me
i
could
see
drinking
it
with
some
spicier
foods
but
definitely
not
a
beer
i
could
sit
down
and
flatout
drink
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
giving
smooth
lagers
everywhere
something
to
aim
for
almost
dangerously
drinkable
a
lager
version
of
an
english
bitter
not
too
strong
but
packed
full
of
flavor
a
great
beer
for
all
parts
of
the
year
but
i
would
recommend
it
for
summer
d
very
drinkable
truly
a
classic
american
beer
with
a
pleasant
malt
character
and
enough
hops
to
balance
d
i
could
easily
drink
a
6er
of
this
beer
and
i
hear
they
open
ferment
on
top
of
the
roofs
in
sf
yet
another
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
read
a
lot
on
beer
advocate
before
i
decide
to
buy
a
beer
and
this
is
one
of
those
ive
wanted
to
try
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
purchased
it
was
in
a
bottle
and
i
chilled
it
slightly
because
it
was
somewhat
warm
poured
into
a
goblet
much
darker
golden
color
and
nice
offwhite
head
i
get
a
nice
hint
of
redraspberries
and
strawberries
it
goes
down
extremely
well
and
is
a
good
beer
to
have
anytime
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
a
good
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
faded
pretty
fast
it
laced
the
glass
well
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
has
a
nice
aroma
of
toasted
malts
and
deeper
roasted
ones
with
a
slight
citrisy
hoppy
finish
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
toasted
malts
and
more
bitter
roasted
ones
with
a
nice
citrisy
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
and
clean
really
refreshing
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
beer
as
it
is
a
really
bold
yet
refreshing
beer
drinkability
i
could
definitely
put
down
multiple
bottles
of
this
beer
in
one
sitting
d
its
a
lager
so
its
very
drinkable
recommended
the
bottom
line
anchors
steam
beer
is
a
venerable
oldster
on
the
craft
brew
scene
at
this
point
but
it
still
persists
as
a
tasty
if
not
particularly
depthy
option
a
great
session
brew
palate
is
good
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
might
be
a
touch
high
in
carbonation
refreshing
infinitely
drinkable
definitely
very
drinkable
and
possibly
good
for
a
session
but
its
just
too
expensive
for
me
on
the
east
to
every
do
such
a
thing
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
ive
had
anchor
steam
before
and
didnt
find
it
that
impressive
now
im
not
sure
how
i
missed
it
sit
down
with
a
pint
and
look
closely
a
gem
incidentally
reminds
me
of
several
saranac
beers
if
you
like
those
check
this
out
now
to
find
another
steam
beer
to
compare
this
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
little
offwhite
head
it
smelled
predominantly
of
malt
with
some
yeast
as
well
it
tasted
like
dirty
malt
with
some
hops
bitterness
it
was
watery
and
smooth
with
no
carbonation
and
a
very
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
surprisingly
dirty
and
bland
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
my
first
of
its
style
i
am
extremely
pleased
with
this
one
in
a
class
all
its
own
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
but
i
could
see
having
a
few
the
mouthfeel
is
sufficiently
chewy
to
give
a
good
overall
body
enjoyable
simple
lager
very
drinkable
brew
i
could
see
myself
having
4
or
5
of
these
in
one
session
md
thick
mouth
feel
like
drinking
a
glass
of
milk
it
is
very
drinkable
and
can
really
see
why
it
is
so
popular
pours
a
fragile
light
gold
with
a
limp
but
persistent
white
head
smells
of
roasted
nuts
with
sugar
taste
is
a
wet
and
sweet
experience
almost
like
that
of
pure
dextrose
or
cotton
candy
but
enriched
with
the
overall
nutty
flavor
of
the
beer
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
past
some
taste
of
alcohol
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
one
of
my
favorite
parts
theres
a
high
level
of
carbonation
but
its
not
abrasive
the
beer
is
exceedingly
smooth
and
light
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
experienced
it
seems
like
the
alcoholic
version
of
something
from
willy
wonka
because
you
almost
cant
believe
it
ive
never
drank
more
than
one
at
a
time
though
and
i
feel
that
after
a
couple
the
distinct
sweetness
might
become
a
little
hard
to
handle
but
for
a
single
beer
especially
if
you
were
to
pair
it
with
a
dessert
or
appetizer
i
think
its
great
d
very
hoppy
strong
taste
overwhelmingly
so
nicely
balanced
fruit
and
grain
underneath
that
take
away
some
of
the
hop
harshness
not
for
the
weak
taste
buds
i
could
only
get
through
one
per
evening
but
i
would
have
another
if
in
the
mood
for
hop
overload
again
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
grassy
or
citrus
hop
flavors
but
got
mostly
tealike
bitterness
instead
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
to
my
tastes
d
very
drinkable
nice
on
a
hot
day
bottom
line
this
is
a
unique
beer
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
ivory
head
consisting
of
large
bubbles
and
good
carbonation
its
smell
was
malty
and
spicy
with
back
notes
of
citrus
the
beers
taste
is
smooth
at
first
primarily
malt
and
smokey
bread
flavors
it
finishes
dry
and
the
aftertaste
is
more
malt
very
bold
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkable
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
definitely
try
this
one
not
sure
if
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
or
steam
beers
in
general
bought
this
in
a
mix
grabsixpack
from
the
food
coop
drank
this
one
first
poured
into
a
pint
glass
darker
than
commercial
lager
flavor
was
a
little
too
sulphorous
but
could
taste
a
good
malt
profile
behind
that
a
decent
first
steamer
for
me
however
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
and
stick
with
ales
or
true
lagers
the
best
of
the
easy
to
find
micros
in
my
opinion
one
of
my
favorites
and
it
seems
to
be
getting
easier
to
find
in
tennessee
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
of
an
awesome
style
highly
recommended
might
be
a
good
gateway
beer
to
get
from
macrobrew
lager
swill
to
the
good
stuff
drinkability
a
long
time
fav
for
me
and
one
i
keep
in
my
rotation
for
everyday
drinking
this
brew
must
be
given
respect
for
being
an
all
time
american
classic
like
said
before
i
too
tried
this
before
a
few
years
ago
and
was
not
impressed
i
guess
with
ago
i
now
know
better
i
enjoyed
a
few
tonight
in
a
sam
adams
glass
and
was
very
impressed
at
10
a
6
pack
it
better
be
good
and
i
will
be
adding
this
as
a
regular
in
my
rotation
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
bitter
brew
without
much
hop
character
the
malts
are
well
proportioned
but
the
body
is
not
there
to
back
them
up
drinkability
isnt
super
high
for
me
i
like
bitter
but
not
quite
as
much
for
this
particular
style
this
is
a
dry
metallic
tangy
bitter
rather
than
an
alum
hoppy
bitter
that
i
prefer
drinkability
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
drinkability
a
very
unique
brew
with
some
interesting
flavors
i
cant
quite
place
an
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
somthing
for
me
for
every
day
pleasant
to
drink
but
that
is
expectable
considering
the
4
9abv
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
appears
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
with
smallish
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
good
lacing
smell
is
sharp
and
clean
but
doesnt
stand
out
initial
taste
is
a
pleasant
bitter
with
sweet
caramel
notes
at
the
end
very
balanced
this
beer
is
smooth
and
it
goes
down
easily
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
and
as
i
found
out
part
of
a
decent
sauce
for
chicken
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
around
where
i
live
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
drinkability
a
great
refreshing
brew
that
at
4
9
abv
makes
a
great
sessionable
brew
this
is
extraordinary
beer
i
think
the
bottle
i
had
may
have
been
just
a
little
old
but
it
didnt
matter
it
poured
with
a
lovely
golden
amber
color
with
a
generous
head
that
left
copious
lacing
in
the
glass
gorgeous
the
smell
was
a
very
nice
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
the
taste
was
a
similar
balance
with
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
kept
in
check
by
the
bitter
hops
it
was
very
drinkable
and
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
easy
drinking
sessiontype
beer
has
that
liquid
bread
quality
to
it
and
being
that
its
from
frisco
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
with
some
good
sourdough
bread
smell
was
intense
and
vinergery
maybe
sweetly
yeasty
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
the
smell
but
it
was
almost
off
from
what
i
remembered
appearance
was
amber
with
a
decent
head
taste
was
slightly
hoppy
and
sweet
it
really
grew
on
me
after
a
few
sips
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
strong
great
as
a
session
or
for
a
quick
few
after
a
thirstifying
day
of
work
real
drinkable
pours
with
small
initial
head
creamy
with
ever
so
slight
offwhite
tinge
mostly
diminishes
but
has
good
lacing
very
aromatic
when
poured
citrus
jumped
out
of
the
glass
at
me
a
little
yeast
and
very
slight
malt
had
a
scent
of
sweet
apples
or
cider
very
clear
amber
appearance
by
the
looks
of
things
actively
carbonated
taste
or
lack
of
it
is
a
dissapointment
medium
duration
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
just
a
really
watery
taste
much
more
so
than
i
remember
maybe
i
have
been
drinking
too
many
tastefilled
ales
recently
the
mouth
is
a
creamy
feel
soft
but
yet
lively
carbonation
lack
of
taste
is
the
biggest
let
down
for
this
brew
i
really
liked
the
anchor
steam
beer
the
maltiness
bitterness
seemed
perfectly
matched
and
balanced
with
everything
else
about
this
beer
the
body
and
carbonation
made
this
both
lightly
filling
and
highly
enjoyable
pours
a
fairly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
good
head
that
retains
nicely
aroma
is
of
grains
yeast
some
fruitiness
not
too
strong
but
pleasant
taste
is
of
more
light
graininess
yeast
light
hop
spice
found
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fair
bodied
very
crisp
and
good
carbonation
i
could
take
a
few
of
these
down
in
succession
but
not
an
entire
6pack
a
very
good
beer
really
great
to
have
on
hand
as
most
people
enjoy
it
d
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
complicated
without
being
overwhelming
very
tasty
overall
this
venerable
old
craft
beer
is
a
tasty
drink
not
exactly
the
most
complex
taste
ive
ever
experienced
but
good
nonetheless
poured
out
of
one
of
their
big
bottles
into
a
pilsner
glass
nice
copper
color
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
sweet
malt
a
lot
of
lagers
look
and
smell
nice
but
i
think
what
sets
anchor
steam
apart
is
its
taste
and
finish
no
after
taste
well
done
should
have
bought
two
d
goes
down
pretty
easily
not
a
lot
of
heft
to
slow
you
down
and
the
taste
is
clean
if
that
makes
sense
drank
this
one
in
the
dark
in
at
the
almamo
drafthouse
movie
theatre
so
i
didnt
see
the
color
but
have
had
it
on
tap
at
anchors
tour
as
well
very
nice
and
fragrant
hoppiness
but
not
overly
so
taste
is
good
with
a
good
bitter
kick
and
hoppy
floraly
citrusy
taste
but
with
some
definite
maltiness
in
there
too
i
was
expecting
more
hoppy
bitterness
from
what
i
remember
of
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
but
was
pleased
at
the
amount
it
had
and
the
reasonable
lasting
hoppy
aftertaste
i
liked
this
beer
and
especially
the
anchor
porter
these
guys
make
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
lightbodied
this
is
an
easy
drinking
session
style
beer
one
of
my
favorites
for
such
a
thing
anytime
is
the
right
time
for
anchor
steam
i
love
opening
the
fridge
and
seeing
this
beer
went
to
the
website
just
to
see
those
big
ol
copper
kettles
reminiscent
of
the
handcraftedness
and
integrity
one
observes
when
a
pizza
is
baked
in
a
real
stone
brick
oven
the
mouth
is
light
and
bright
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
easy
to
session
of
your
not
in
the
mood
for
a
pallet
burner
this
beer
is
easy
to
pair
with
food
just
avoid
anything
to
spicy
i
really
like
this
beer
incredibale
you
dont
find
many
like
this
smell
is
a
little
weak
compared
to
most
craft
beers
but
for
a
low
abv
session
its
not
so
bad
very
clean
good
water
some
hop
and
malt
balance
taste
clean
and
fresh
hops
are
present
as
is
the
malt
but
overall
it
is
pretty
watery
feels
refreshing
and
almost
a
soda
type
carbonation
a
good
beer
for
its
style
probably
much
better
on
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
it
is
the
hallmark
of
the
style
and
the
standard
by
which
all
others
in
the
style
are
measured
it
is
extremely
easy
drinking
and
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
substantially
full
for
sure
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
just
a
solid
beer
nothing
that
really
extreme
to
impress
me
but
you
really
have
to
give
this
beer
credit
for
starting
the
craftbeermicrobrew
movement
d
a
one
of
a
kind
offering
an
excellent
session
beer
and
a
pioneer
of
the
us
craft
beer
movement
anchor
steam
is
the
definition
of
a
steam
beer
and
a
must
try
for
beer
enthusiasts
nothing
extravagant
just
beer
made
the
way
it
should
be
little
disappointing
but
still
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
d
hard
to
get
through
even
one
for
me
because
the
taste
is
so
laboreous
a
great
beer
and
an
american
classic
like
i
mentioned
above
its
a
balanced
brew
that
would
make
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
excellent
this
is
an
absolutely
wonderful
session
beer
a
true
american
classic
clear
amber
with
fluffy
head
nice
malt
rich
aroma
flavor
is
extremely
wellbalanced
bitter
hops
and
malt
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
of
my
recent
recollection
better
than
a
macrobrew
because
at
least
it
has
a
distinctive
taste
but
not
better
by
much
my
new
favorite
lager
anchor
steam
poured
into
the
pint
glass
a
great
amber
color
with
some
nice
head
and
decent
lacing
very
light
scent
a
nice
mix
of
malts
and
hops
but
not
much
there
very
good
flavor
each
taste
seemed
to
bring
out
a
hidden
quality
of
the
beer
with
different
swirls
of
hops
or
malts
easily
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
ever
had
have
had
it
from
the
bottle
too
and
not
quite
as
smooth
an
excellent
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
has
an
odd
caramel
aroma
kind
of
powdery
perfumey
its
weird
but
not
offensive
the
taste
is
of
lightly
toasted
malt
grainy
with
a
shot
of
bitter
hops
in
the
end
nothing
crazy
with
the
hops
subtle
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
slightly
fizzy
finishes
rather
clean
and
crisp
nothing
outstanding
here
a
bit
grainy
which
im
not
a
fan
of
however
it
is
nice
and
light
and
a
good
change
up
brew
a
higher
than
average
drinkability
goes
well
with
lighter
dishes
such
as
poultry
and
seafood
my
second
brew
from
anchor
and
i
am
still
very
impressed
really
liked
their
anniversary
ale
and
this
steam
beer
was
certainly
good
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
modest
frothy
head
smell
is
good
very
nutty
and
bready
taste
is
very
slick
and
full
of
bready
and
slightly
caramelvanilla
flavors
mouthfeel
is
super
and
the
drinkability
is
really
exceptional
goes
down
like
water
without
any
bitter
aftertones
whatsoever
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
brew
and
with
a
modest
alcohol
content
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
setting
copped
a
single
12
oz
size
from
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
for
about
1
50
recommended
this
beer
has
a
clear
amber
color
with
minimal
head
no
lacing
and
medium
carbonation
the
aroma
is
lacking
anything
profound
there
is
some
graininess
to
the
initial
taste
with
a
precenance
of
hopps
that
controls
the
taste
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
brew
but
it
is
at
least
worth
a
try
wow
what
a
beer
so
different
and
interesting
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
top
session
beers
it
is
well
structured
in
flavor
and
drinkable
with
out
being
watery
aqueous
or
wimpy
i
have
difficulty
describing
the
flavor
but
i
highly
recommend
you
try
it
out
right
away
anchor
is
always
a
goto
beer
when
i
cant
decide
what
i
want
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
except
thanks
to
fritz
and
anchor
for
being
revolutionaries
drinkability
will
change
dramatically
i
suspect
to
personal
taste
i
was
satisfied
by
the
time
i
finished
the
pint
but
didnt
feel
the
need
to
order
it
again
smell
is
earthy
malts
with
some
floral
hops
citrus
taste
is
fruit
with
some
bitter
hops
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
i
could
drink
this
bad
boy
all
day
long
d
not
bad
at
all
i
could
see
this
as
an
easy
go
to
beer
not
an
overly
complex
brew
but
a
pretty
tasty
one
none
the
less
definitely
worth
a
try
anchor
steam
is
my
favorite
all
around
beer
i
love
the
shape
of
the
bottle
and
often
dont
bother
pouring
it
into
a
pint
glass
since
the
bottle
feels
so
good
in
hand
the
taste
is
good
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
but
very
easy
drinking
this
is
what
macro
lagers
should
probably
taste
like
a
great
choice
at
the
tavern
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
in
the
northwest
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
i
have
to
drive
45
minutes
to
find
a
store
that
carries
it
whole
foods
in
portland
or
but
it
is
worth
the
time

d
very
sessionable
ive
seen
this
on
tap
at
the
local
pubs
id
definitely
enjoy
this
brew
with
a
burger
or
steak
pours
a
deep
cooper

carbonation
seems
heavy
lots
of
bubbles
below
a

are
good
aroma
is
malty
earthy
and
somehow
industrial
a
bitter
pang
hits
you
as
soon
as
it
touches
your
tongue
for
a
couple
sips
you
might
wonder
if
its
a
bad
bottle
but
keep
it
up
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
out
there
all
around
its
a
good
beer
and
a
great
example
of
its
style
its
very
drinkable
and
is
remaniscent
of
many
beers
on
the
west
coast
in
yesteryear
need
i
even
mention
that
this
is
extremely
drinkable
easily
1
in
its
category
and
a
distinguished
proud
american
classic
next
time
you
wear
yourself
out
on
highgravity
ales
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
anchor
steam
and
be
glad
i
really
should
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
around
at
all
times
d
i
should
have
bought
a
case
very
nice
beer
i
have
no
problem
give
this
4
across
the
board
ive
learned
a
lot
about
beer
since
my
first
anchor
steam
but
this
always
a
great
place
to
revisted
drinkability
this
is
a
refreshing
and
classic
brew
each
bottle
i
have
had
over
the
years
has
had
its
own
character
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
totally
sessionable
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
actually
thought
this
beer
was
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
tap
drinkability
definately
good
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
a
superb
choice
for
a
session
if
you
want
to
try
the
best
example
of
a
steam
beer
go
with
this
one
as
it
is
the
original
pours
a
clear
light
copper
hue
with
a
one
finger
big
bubbled
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
small
thin
layer
stickiness
is
very
minimal
and
weak
smell
is
a
nice
fresh
floral
aroma
with
a
sweet
light
caramel
malt
some
light
citric
fruit
is
present
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
metallic
at
first
but
the
caramel
malt
becomes
present
caramel
and
a
hint
of
light
milk
chocolate
is
then
followed
by
a
grassy
floral
taste
on
the
tongue
aftertaste
is
a
bit
bland
with
a
cardboard
like
flavor
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
light
bodied
with
a
good
full
carbonation
nice
crisp
session
brew
that
can
be
enjoyable
at
all
times
of
the
year
d
very
fine
drinkability
here
easily
sessionable
and
allaround
tasty
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
and
feel
good
about
it

smells

breadgrain
toasted

and
some

taste
is
same
as
the
aroma
but
it
starts
out
hoppy

comes
the

and
finally
it

a
good

good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
its
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
good
overall
beer
a
pretty
decent
choice
as
a
session
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
the
smell
with
toasted
malt
and
a
mild
sweetness
dominating
along
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
citrusy
hop
flavor
very
well
balanced
and
very
refreshing
crisp
carbonation
and
a
nice
medium
body
yet
light
on
the
palate
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
flavourful
and
full
of
character
nice
crisp
taste
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
flavor
changes
and
is
more
complex
than
i
remember
initially
hoppy
in
an
english
bitter
sort
of
way
that
changes
towards
the
middle
and
end
of
the
brew
where
it
becomes
more
caramel
with
a
chalky
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
more
hearty
than
expected
however
its
dryness
and
complexity
would
lead
one
to
call
this
an
excellent
session
drinkability
smooth
enough
to
be
enjoyable
back
to
back
bitter
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
a
session
beer
for
my
tastes
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
delish
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
unique
dating
system
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
solid
copper
color
it
had
just
under
a
finger
of
white
foam
that
slowly
settled
into
a
partial
film
no
lacing
but
good
carb
the
aroma
was
earthy
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
was
pretty
good
malty
with
a
crisp
bitter
from
start
to
finish
it
has
a
really
bitter
aftertaste
that
sticks
around
just
a
little
too
long
for
me
to
really
enjoy
i
like
the
strong
bitter
on
the
adipas
ive
been
having
lately
so
not
a
problem
with
bitter
perse
but
something
about
this
one
the
carb
makes
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
not
sure
id
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
but
maybe
once
in
awhile
if
i
saw
as
a
single
or
if
on
tap
somewhere
as
a
changeup
3
5
rb
t
o
d
the
reason
anchor
steam
beer
and
anchor
liberty
ale
are
the
brewerys
top
national
sellers
is
that
they
are
extremely
drinkable
beers
smashin
a
sixer
of
each
is
no
problem
at
all
following
honestly
good
stuff
i
find
it
baffling
that
anchor
steam
only
gets
an
85
on
b
a
since
its
the
definitive
example
of
the
california
common
style
and
one
of
the
catapults
for
the
craft
beer
renaissance
20
years
ago
as
much
as
today
imho
if
this
isnt
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
then
craft
beer
is
dead
smell
is
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
starts
out
somewhat
dark
and
malty
but
the
hops
kick
in
towards
the
end
the
hoppy
taste
is
almost
a
bit
smoky
or
like
black
pepper
its
an
interesting
taste
and
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
above
average
but
not
amazing
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
because
of
the
low
abv
and
the
lightness
easy
drinking
and
juicy
cant
complain
and
could
enjoy
any
time
wellbuttered
french
bread
with
light
ham
goes
great
and
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
seafood
and
a
salad
nice
luncheon
beer
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
does
not
really
taste
like
much
but
it
was
pretty
light
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
good
for
the
summer
or
grilling
the
number
one
thing
that
comes
to
my
mind
about
this
beer
is
distinctive
think
about
it
its
a
beer
brewed
with
bottom
fermenting
lageryeast
but
fermented
at
an
ale
temperature
i
guess
you
could
say
you
kind
of
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
in
this
beer
indeed
this
beer
more
less
possesses
the
flavors
of
an
ale
with
the
smooth
crispness
of
a
lager
only
drawback
is
its
a
little
pricey
but
in
my
opinion
its
well
worth
a
little
extra
cash
sampled
from
1
pt
6
oz
bottle
pours
clear
ambercopper
color
with
slightly
offwhite
head
thick
head
at
first
that
takes
some
time
to
settle
but
once
it
does
it
leaves
a
nice
residue
for
the
remainder
of
the
beer
medium
carbonation
and
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
mainly
of
malt
and
sweetness
but
there
seems
to
be
a
small
very
small
touch
of
bitterness
flavor
is
nearly
identical
mostly
malt
some
caramel
with
a
toasted
feel
to
it
but
there
is
a
taste
of
bitter
hops
in
there
a
very
nice
balance
leaves
a
slightly
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
that
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
but
wasnt
terrible
either
overall
a
great
beer
easy
drinker
with
a
great
taste
to
it
anchor
seems
to
have
cornered
the
market
on
steam
beer
but
readers
beware
flying
dog
puts
out
a
very
nice
california
common
called
old
scratch
that
gives
this
brew
a
run
for
its
money
if
not
surpassing
it
in
taste
dpretty
darn
drinkable
it
does
however
leave
a
little
of
that
odd
metallic
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
and
a
bit
of
that
slicknees
on
my
tounge
drinkability
is
absolutely
perfect
this
is
the
example
of
the
style
if
steam
beer
isnt
named
after
this
it
should
be
highly
recommended
d
very
drinkable
a
craft
beer
classic
im
very
lucky
to
live
in
the
bay
area
where
this
stuff
can
be
found
damn
near
everywhere
on
tap
d
this
is
definitely
a
session
beer
tastes
good
enough
and
low
enough
abv
that
you
could
throw
back
a
few
of
them
not
bad
but
not
great
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
put
back
a
few
because
it
doesnt
fill
you
up
besides
aroma
this
beer
is
pleasingly
good
on
all
levels
goes
down
smooth
with
a
body
on
the
light
side
and
appropriate
carbonation
a
fantastic
thirst
quencher
and
extremely
drinkable
coming
home
from
a
quick
trip
to
the
grocery
store
in
a
scorching
hot
car
on
a
100
degree
day
i
couldnt
wait
to
crack
this
open
and
it
did
the
job
id
drink
a
few
more
but
tomorrow
will
be
hot
again
d
personally
im
not
fond
of
that
nutshell
flavour
d
another
winner
for
me
from
this
great
brewery
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
company
has
been
so
strong
for
so
long
light
enough
to
have
several
but
complex
enough
to
keep
you
enjoy
every
sip
drinkability
a
very
interesting
beer
somewhat
rare
and
unique
this
beer
has
great
taste
an
abv
less
than
5
and
i
dont
get
bored
or
filled
up
drinking
it
just
a
perfect
session
beer
however
it
is
unfortunately
somewhat
expensive
for
me
i
purchased
some
anchor
6
packs
on
sale
for
6
99
they
are
regularly
7
99
if
this
were
less
than
6
a
six
pack
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
deep
amber
in
color
with
thick
creamy
head
very
drinkable
beer
and
like
the
other
anchor
entries
that
ive
triedporter
and
liberty
ale
very
tasty
and
satisfying
the
head
was
not
that
long
lasting
and
the
lacing
was
mediocre
still
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
recommend
flavor
grows
on
you
d
a
super
beer
to
spend
a
session
with
tasty
but
not
overly
done
this
one
has
a
lovely
copperish
color
and
a
subtle
but
enticing
smell
steeped
in
hops
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malt
it
is
quite
flavorful
yet
light
enough
to
enjoy
again
and
again
without
bogging
down
the
stomach
mmmm
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
reddishamber
sort
of
a
cider
color
14
inch
head
that
settles
to
almost
nothing
sort
of
bready
in
the
nose
earthy
malt
balanced
with
a
very
faint
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
sort
of
peculiar
not
much
flavor
at
all
at
the
beginning
of
the
drink
although
it
tastes
very
fresh
and
pure
the
taste
is
mostly
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
and
ends
with
a
ryelike
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
crispy
and
smooth
especially
served
relatively
cool
quite
drinkable
as
well
it
is
almost
like
a
brown
ale
with
an
extremely
light
body
and
a
little
less
flavor
good
session
beer
i
would
imagine
an
allaround
solid
brew
nice
west
coast
offering
as
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
hops
and
the
smoothness
certainly
makes
it
a
breeze
to
drink
would
be
a
good
companion
to
some
sf
seafood
very
smooth
mediumbodied
beer
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
definitley
worth
trying
if
you
havent
yet
d
i
can
imagine
a
lot
of
situations
this
would
be
a
great
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
choose
it
often
out
of
a
huge
lineup
still
not
bad
taste
great
quickly
one
of
my
favorite
beer
would
definitely
have
another
one
ice
tea
brown
a
thin
but
steady
head
with
a
lot
of
lace
smells
of
malt
and
white
bread
tangy
with
nice
carbonation
a
touch
of
clove
flavor
with
a
pleasant
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
mild
but
interesting
flavor
this
would
always
be
a
welcome
selection
nice
dwhat
more
can
i
say
this
is
a
true
classic
and
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
into
the
whole
craft
movement
this
is
a
welcome
summer
beer
on
a
humid
evening
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brewbut
nothing
special
it
was
interesting
to
try
this
steam
beer
definately
worth
a
try
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
dvery
drinkable
could
easily
be
a
session
of
not
a
lot
else
was
available
pours
a
clean
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
malt
characteristic
and
the
same
for
taste
but
with
a
dryer
end
a
sweet
dryness
left
in
the
mouth
a
very
easy
going
smooth
beer
lots
of
repect
to
anchor
it
got
my
parents
to
understand
craft
beer
this
is
one
beer
that
i
like
better
from
the
bottle
than
on
tap
it
is
light
and
damn
refreshing
this
beer
is
a
true
american
classic
and
one
id
be
glad
to
drink
any
time
d
very
drinkable
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
by
any
stretch
but
a
very
good
one
d
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
to
have
on
hot
days
there
may
be
more
flavorful
beers
out
there
but
not
many
as
exceptionally
balanced
as
this
one
overall
impression
a
lightly
fruity
beer
with
a
firm
grainy
maltiness
toasty
and
caramel
flavors
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
steam
beer
is
beer
fermented
with
a
lager
yeast
strain
at
warmer
temperatures
around
60f
hense
the
name
steam
beer
also
known
as
california
common
style
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
eventually
laces
nicely
the
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
hoppy
aroma
to
it
and
the
taste
is
that
of
oranges
hops
black
pepper
and
some
lemon
the
beer
goes
down
easy
and
opens
up
as
the
beer
warms
up
to
the
proper
serving
temp
there
is
a
nice
dry
hopped
after
taste
to
the
beer
as
it
feels
carbonated
just
right
any
more
would
induce
soda
like
qualities
d
great
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
here
in
md
i
would
make
it
a
regular
on
my
roster
this
is
a
beautiful
effervescent
copper
color
and
shows
a
nice
spongey
eggshell
head
with
no
lace
really
the
nose
is
herbal
hop
sugar
cracked
grain
and
very
faint
all
around
taste
is
smooth
soft
bready
grain
with
a
pleasant
brassy
undertone
the
finish
is
drying
with
a
faint
hop
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
one
that
puts
emphasis
on
malt
yet
stays
extremely
light
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
round
smooth
fluffy
this
is
the
consummate
pale
lager
a
wonderful
balance
between
the
sugary
malt
and
the
slightly
spicy
hops
makes
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
you
can
tell
why
this
one
kicked
off
a
revolution
if
youve
never
tried
it
youre
missing
out
a
dependable
beer
i
could
have
anytime
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
and
i
strongly
recommend
it
nothing
special
especialy
for
the
regular
price
i
got
this
on
sale
for
6
99
but
i
wouldnt
pay
the
9
it
usually
is
this
is
a
beer
i
have
seen
on
the
shelves
for
a
while
but
never
have
tried
im
trying
many
different
styles
more
often
and
never
realized
that
this
was
in
its
on
category
i
would
say
as
far
as
steam
beer
it
is
not
going
to
get
any
better
than
anchor
very
surprised
amber
color
malt
sweetness
and
lemon
undertones
taste
is
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
this
is
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
off
the
charts
to
the
anchors
version
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
this
is
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
if
you
want
something
a
lot
of
substance
that
isnt
going
try
to
knock
you
over
i
liked
this
beer
and
thought
it
was
very
good
its
slightly
thickfeeling
but
smooth
no
bite
whatsoever
and
thicker
than
you
would
think
its
a
substantial
ale
but
with
a
flowery
and
smoky
depth
very
very
good
after
reading
various
reviews
about
this
beer
i
decided
to
try
this
brew
i
must
agree
with
the
majority
this
is
a
good
beer
it
has
a
little
bit
of
an
aftertaste
after
awhile
but
nothing
to
make
me
not
want
to
not
buy
another
one
the
color
is
amber
and
the
smell
was
citrus
like
the
taste
is
very
good
and
flavourful
roasted
malt
and
grain
thats
semi
sweet
hits
me
first
and
then
some
caramel
malt
provides
some
sweetness
and
thats
backed
up
by
a
good
hop
profile
that
adds
some
nice
bitterness
it
has
a
very
good
mouthfeel
and
has
medium
carbonation
the
finish
is
all
nice
and
bitter
and
it
leaves
a
short
but
pleasing
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
that
i
need
to
visit
more
often
i
heartily
recommend
it
quite
a
nice
balanced
beer
that
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
unfortunately
it
is
sporadically
available
here
and
pretty
bloody
pricey
5
957
99aus
otherwise
its
be
a
4
at
least
in
the
drinkability
well
i
think
this
is
my
new
session
brew
great
flavor
and
cheap
bmc
exclusive
drinkers
dont
know
what
they
are
missing
final
statement
now
i
understand
why
this
is
such
a
classic
this
is
just
a
good
solid
brew
a
lager
that
drinks
like
an
ale
a
must
try
for
any
ba
presented
from
the
tap
in
a
pint
glass
very
clear
with
an
amber
hue
and
a
couple
fingers
of
head
the
beer
smells
like
bread
with
hints
of
fruit
wow
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
clean
fresh
and
crisp
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
i
dont
know
how
i
missed
this
one
for
so
long
i
had
hopes
for
this
beer
and
boy
it
did
it
hit
the
spot
it
just
took
the
lead
in
the
unorganized
invitational
from
its
brother
anchor
bock
itll
have
to
hold
off
new
belgiums

to
secure
the
title
color
is
a
beautiful
dark
brownish
amber
while
head
is
thin
but
fine
aroma
is
weak
but
pleasant
decidedly
malty
however
my
allergy
was
acting
up
some
when
i
tried
this
flavor
is
rich
malty
and
bitter
with
a
snipped
of
fruit
undertone
jazzy
zingy
nice
and
rough
it
is
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
if
not
spectacular
lager
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
aroma
is
somewhat
malty
taste
is
somewhat
of
a
cross
between
a
lager
and
an
ale
as
expected
some
fruitiness
of
an
ale
balanced
with
the
smoothness
of
a
lager
interesting
combination
of
styles
apparently
steam
beer
is
a
style
thats
not
prdouced
as
often
anymore
this
is
the
perfect
summer
companion
easy
to
drink
all
daynight
cant
find
anything
that
comes
even
close
to
this
beer
as
far
as
quality
and
uniqueness
pairs
well
with
any
pasta
dish
pours
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
a
rocky
head
smells
of
biscuity
buttery
bready
malts
with
some
sour
fruit
mixed
in
taste
is
almost
dry
upfront
and
quite
crisp
overall
somewhat
astringent
decent
amount
of
hops
but
they
play
a
supporting
role
here
light
in
body
and
very
drinkable
at
this
abv
as
the
beer
that
revived
brewing
in
this
country
i
suppose
i
should
give
it
higher
marks
but
i
prefer
their
liberty
ale
d
very
drinkable
beer
spicy
malts
make
the
taste
and
smell
very
interesting
head
retains
to
the
last
drop
great
beer
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
theres
nothing
really
fancy
about
it
its
just
straightup
flavorful
and
drinkable
give
it
a
try
if
you
havent
already
done
so
recommended
while
not
as
excellent
as
some
beers
dont
be
surprised
when
this
one
turns
out
to
be
one
of
your
favorites
its
good
old
reliable
good
to
the
core
and
a
good
beer
to
start
out
any
night
anchor
steam
deserves
its
classic
status
and
is
a
very
dependable
beer
like
an
old
friend
subtleness
is
its
strength
decent
mouthfeel
but
despite
its
shortcomings
in
the
taste
department
this
is
an
oddly
drinkable
beer
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
really
was
expecting
more
flavour
and
a
better
mouthfeel
from
a
beer
most
beer
lovers
in
the
uk
have
at
least
heard
of
if
not
tried
could
easily
become
a
session
beer
for
me
good
drinkable
brew
from
anchor
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
is
a
mild
yeast
with
some
malts
taste
is
refreshing
with
some
sweet
malts
and
a
mild
bitter
finish
i
drank
the
bottle
in
less
than
10
minutes
so
very
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
excellent
beer
anchor
steam
beer
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
at
first
the
aroma
is
fruity
then
caramel
malt
becomes
apparent
caramel
malt
and
a
nice
hop
presence
make
for
a
classic
beer
sessionable
and
recommended
drinkability
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
easy
on
the
eyes
and
easy
going
down
a
great
session
beer
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
not
be
disappointed
the
beer
is
a
pleasing
golden
amber
with
decent
had
that
rapidly
dissipates
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
just
a
bit
hoppy
there
is
very
little
hoppiness
in
the
flavor
which
is
rather
malty
and
very
sweet
which
was
ok
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
smooth
and
pleasant
poured

oz

into
a

a
copper

look
with
a
generous
head
that
has
a
medium
lace
caramel
and
nuts
come
out
in
the
smell
with
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
bread
too
i
tasted
the
bread
first
followed
by
the
caramel
and
nuts
finishes
up
with
the
hops
you
can
tell
they
are
there
for
sure
its
strong
in
the
mouth
but
enjoyable
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
one
for
the
future
sipping
taste
has
some
maltiness
to
it
with
a
sour
astringent
grassy
hop
note
and
a
metallic
copper
flavor
its
overly
carbonated
with
an
unpleasant
tasting
hopmetal
aftertaste
not
especially
tasty
or
easy
to
drink
it
sure
looked
good
but
damn
i
just
dont
see
what
everyone
is
nutting
over
with
this
one
generally
drink
in
bottles
my

it
anybody
know
of
another
place
temendous
as
a
session
brew
poured
a
crisp
orange
with
a
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
a
great
blend
of
caramel
and
pale
hops
balanced
with
earthy
citrus
hops
the
taste
had
a
great
malt
sweetness
in
the
initial
and
a
great
hop
bite
in
the
finish
the
beer
was
light
and
crisp
on
the
palate
this
is
a
great
session
beer
got
this
after
hearing
so
many
rave
reviews
on

from

smell
was
mostly
malty
bready
taste
was
a
lot
of
bread
and
grain
slight
sweet
maltiness
and
even
slighter
hop
aftertate
overall
though
the
grainer
texture
and
taste
dominates
with
a
more
standard
lager
flavor
following
up
feel
is
fairly
thin
bodied
with
that
grainy
texture
and
medium
carbonation
um
i
dunno
i
feel
like
im
supposed
to
like
this
beer
its
unique
and
fairly
acclaimed
but
i
didnt
its
definitely
better
than
your
standard
macrolagers
or
even
most
lagers
overall
i
guess
itd
be
sessionable
if
i
was
forced
to
drink
lagers
but
its
just
not
great
d
good
beer
not
over
the
top
and
easy
to
session
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
and
leaves
a
dry
taste
in
my
mouth
but
its
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
classic
very
good
beer
definitely
recommended
d
highly
drinkable
my
all
time
session
beer
if
i
had
to
drink
only
one
beer
forever
right
now
this
would
be
it
extremely
pleasant

okay
drinkable

definitely
not
something
i
buy
on
any
kind
of
a
regular
basis
its
a

company
and
a
storied
style
but
anchor
makes
far
better
beer
anchor
porter
e
g
very
drinkable
straightforward
approachable
yet
tasty
well
crafted
session
brew
would
be
a
great
brew
for
introducing
bmc
drinkers
to
craft
brew
will
be
enjoying
a
few
more
of
these
this
summer
good
body
and
very
crisp
carbonation
that
avoids
numbing
the
tongue
this
will
never
blow
away
my
taste
buds
but
anchor
steam
is
one
of
the
very
best
sessionable
american
beers
in
my
estimation
just
an
easy
drinking
wellmade
brew
to
have
while
hanging
out
with
friends
pours
a
thick
slightly
off
white
head
and
copper
color
smells
of
fresh
malt
tastes
fresh
grassy
maybe
a
little
buttery
doesnt
seem
to
have
too
much
aftertaste
slightly
effervescent
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
creamy
texture
this
one
is
deffinetly
not
bad
i
dont
detect
much
hoppyness
to
it
but
yeah
its
still
good

this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
great
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
a
new
place
that
opened
up
nice
beern
selection
too
metallic
copper
in
color
with
a
quickly
dissapating
head
smell
in
the
bottle
is
kind
of
corny
taste
is
very
lager
like
with
a
little
more
carbonation
more
malty
than
a
lager
good
carbonation
and
good
tart
finish
as
a
common
beer
it
is
very
good
this
is
a
good
sessioner
goes
great
with
a
steak
a
good
standby
beer
to
keep
on
hand
for
your
friends
not
exotic
but
different
and
more
uncommon
than
common
copper
white
headsightly
tart
first
taste
that
pops
out
into
a
great
malty
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
like
i
said
a
solid
great
brew
d
pretty
decent
i
could
drink
these
all
night
strange
brew
i
dont
like
it
but
im
sure
thats
my
palate
and
not
the
beer
i
recommend
you
try
it
and
see
what
you
think
this
is
an
odd
beer
for
me
everytime
i
drink
one
it
seems
to
taste
a
little
different
to
me
sometimes
the
yeast
goes
a
bit
chalky
sometimes
the
hops
are
especially
grassy
sometimes
it
comes
off
really
earthy
and
rustic
sometimes
it
seems
really
clean
even
out
of
the
same
six
packs
maybe
my
palate
has
just
been
wacky
lately
anyhow
pours
hazy
light
copper
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
lightly
malty
with
light
yeasty
fruitiness
and
spicy
hops
starts
off
with
a
nice
even
keeled
maltiness
the
yeast
then
perks
up
with
some
fruity
notes
and
earthiness
accented
by
the
hops
hops
turn
spicy
through
the
finish
light
body
highly
carbonated
not
abrasive
but
not
creamy
eitherjust
the
right
level
of
aggressiveness
great
session
beer
cheers2beers
because
this
was
the
first
steam
beer
i
was
ever
exposed
to
i
suppose
im
biased
towards
it
still
while
pouring
a
magnificent
2
5
finger
head
and
lacing
the
glass
nicely
it
lacks
a
distinctive
smell
taste
while
not
overpowering
is
strong
enough
to
get
your
attention
and
i
find
it
to
be
a
beer
one
can
drink
all
night
long
assuming
an
unlimited
budget
im
very
happy
that
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
after
a
long
hiatus
this
is
an
excellent
beer
you
cant
drink
just
one
overall
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
not
having
experienced
this
style
i
cant
really
say
if
its
a
bad
example
or
a
good
one
ill
have
to
try
the
style
more
before
i
can
say
if
i
like
it
or
not
congrats
to
anchor
though
for
going
the
creative
mile
d
d
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
that
has
little
character
in
my
opinion
just
something
to
pour
down
your
neck
however
does
beat
macro
in
appearance
and
smell
not
too
sure
about
taste
tho
glad
i
tried
it
once
dont
drink
and
review
drinks
too
easy
baseline
for
the
style
even
better
on
draft
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
i
could
drink
these
all
evening
long
and
at
just
4
9
that
would
be
a
great
option
anchor
steam
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
im
glad
im
finally
getting
a
chance
to
review
it
crisp
feel
especially
if
its
colder
a
nice
low
alcohol
brew
should
try
it
again
in
the
summer
smooth
and
drinkable
but
i
dont
find
it
particularly
interesting
there
are
more
ambitious
beers
on
the
american
market
and
there
are
lots
of
other
good
innovative
steam
beers
too
but
this
is
a
classic
and
one
that
never
dissapoints
highly
recommended
overall
a
flavorful
bitter
clean
beer
with
just
enough
malt
to
keep
it
balanced
and
interesting
pours
a
pretty
goldencopper
color
topped
by
a
smallish
bright
white
head
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
and
adjunct
malts
along
with
some
light
sweet
fruit
palate
is
much
the
same
caramel
malt
a
hint
of
adjunct
and
some
lighlty
fruity
hops
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
great
for
session
drinking
a
unique
american
classic
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
clear
copper
with
a
good
half
inch
white
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
faint
but
a
full
maltiness
with
some
fruits
some
citrus
in
the
hopping
its
decent
taste
is
classic
as
good
as
a
lager
will
get
for
me
because
it
kind
of
isnt
nice
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
its
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
balanced
clean
crisp
they
really
have
it
just
right
it
enjoys
popularity
for
a
reason
drinkabilityi
stopped
drinking
it
this
was
recommended
to
me
and
i
was
quite
happy
about
it
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
little
head
and
some
crowning
after
it
thins
the
smell
is
very
woody
with
subtle
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
rather
light
but
with
some
good
hops
and
is
quite
dry
its
fairly
mediumbodied
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
served
ontap
in
a
pilsner
style
glass
clear
dark
amber
in
color
minimal
head
with
good
lacing
on
glass
as
it
is
drank
smell
of
malted
barley
and
hops
trace
of
banana
flavors
of
molasses
and
coffee
good
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
definitely
can
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
without
realizing
it
drinkability
a
classic
session
brew
and
a
nice
return
to
excellent
normalcy
for
me
after
having
several
complicated
brews
over
the
christmas
season
this
classic
lives
up
to
its
name
and
is
a
great
easy
drinking
brew
while
still
providing
phenominal
quality
this
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
attacks
your
buds
rather
one
that
grows
on
you
d
a
nice
brew
i
always
enjoy
picking
one
up
but
the
price
always
seems
to
be
a
bit
much
for
the
quality
drinkability
is
on
par
the
beer
pours
a
midamber
color
and
has
a
firm
thick
bubbly
head
it
is
mildlycarbonatedand
and
has
a
pleasant
citrusy
hop
smell
a
quick
sniff
in
the
glass
reveals
a
touch
of
grainy
malt
and
a
more
floral
character
to
the
hops
in
the
mouth
it
is
not
too
lively
with
the
flavor
dominated
by
a
firm
bitterness
displaying
the
floral
hop
character
noticed
in
the
nose
the
citrusy
character
is
there
too
but
becomes
more
subdued
as
the
beer
warms
in
the
glass
it
is
balanced
by
a
dryish
but
rich
malt
body
with
a
caramelly
burnt
touch
finish
is
a
bitter
blend
of
burnt
caramel
and
hops
leaving
a
lingering
bitter
and
slightly
cloying
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
a
great
beer
one
of
the
betterknown
american
craft
brews
but
deserving
of
its
popularity
this
was
my
first
legal
beer
if
i
remember
correctly
and
i
remember
really
not
liking
it
im
drinking
this
and
realizing
how
my
palette
has
developed
because
this
really
is
a
pretty
damn
good
session
beer
next
time
youre
watching
the
game
or
hitting
the
woods
with
the
guys
sub
out
your
macro
or
even
craft
lager
and
bring
a
case
of
these
along
dsomething
i
could
drink
plenty
of
and
not
have
a
problem
wellconstructed
and
undemanding
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
d
easyily
sessionable
mellow
flavor
well
deserving
of
its
hype
had
this
on
draught
at
the
mellow
mushroom
on
hwy
5
in
douglasville
i
was
quite
impressed
with
it
it
poured
a
burnt
orange
colour
with
a
very
pretty
offwhite
head
lots
of
co2
streaming
skyward
kept
the
foamy
cap
from
fading
away
for
some
time
plenty
of
gluelike
lacing
in
this
one
too
looks
good
the
smell
was
quite
lovely
as
well
heavy
malt
with
light
hops
this
almost
reminded
me
of
the
breakfast
cereal
sugar
smacks
certainly
very
inviting
much
more
hops
in
the
flavour
than
was
evident
in
the
smell
this
is
very
well
balanced
pleasant
malty
sweetness
up
front
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
rock
solid
beer
mouthfeel
seemed
well
rounded
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
truly
enjoyed
this
one
i
ended
up
having
two
pints
delicious
very
light
pour
vanishing
head
and
mediocre
lacing
aromas
were
malty
with
some
floral
quality
taste
was
better
than
expected
bready
malts
with
a
slightly
sweet
character
then
a
nice
delicate
hop
finish
very
crisp
clean
taste
and
good
carbonation
a
very
sessionable
brew
pairs
well
with
just
about
anything
overall
id
rate
anchor
steam
as
a
very
solid
beer
great
flavor
and
high
drinkability
make
this
one
i
would
recommend
and
will
definitely
continue
to
purchase
glad
i
found
this
one
about
8
months
ago
highly
recommended
overall
this
beer
has
a
very
rustic
distinct
character
and
as
innovators
of
the
style
a
great
benchmark
anchor
steam
makes
a
nononsense
american
lager
a
steam
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
via
the
american
hop
infused
malt
core
its
stronger
than
your
average
apa
drinkability
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
have
to
admit
the
grassy
flavor
reminds
me
too
much
of
some
macros
or
a
can
of
boddingtons
not
a
huge
fan
but
it
is
the
epitome
of
the
style
oh
i
like
this
one
better
than
last
time
i
reviewed
it
at
least
drinkabilty
goes
down
easier
than
an
italian
footballer
in
the
penalty
box
a
great
allyear
round
beer
that
matches
well
with
everyday
food
the
subtle
sweetness
is
definitely
from
the
malt
flavors
that
are
heavily
present
has
a
great
easy
to
drink
flavor
nice
mix
of
flavor
extremely
enjoyable
and
at
4
9
it
has
a
decent
abv
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
beer
and
i
find
it
to
be
scarce
in
many
bars
this
is
a
well
crafty
beer
and
has
a
nice
overall
mouth
feel
and
drink
ability
pretty
neat
history
behind
the
name
and
the
brewery
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
beer
that
has
been
a
long
time
coming
for
a
review
from
me
i
enjoyed
every
last
drop
well
recomended
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
but
falling
head
the
smell
is
slightly
malty
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
hops
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
heavy

with
a
small
carbonation
bite
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
high
as
they
tend
to
slide
back
easily
without
being
too
filling
pours
a
bright
nearly
transparent
amber
with
a
substantial
fine
bubbled
head
aromas
of
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
not
very
expressive
but
true
to
style
rich
creamy
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
tastes
of
light
fruitiness
citric
hops
and
dry
crackery
malts
at
the
finish
very
active
toward
the
end
lingers
on
the
tongue
a
while
overall
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
understated
but
flavorful
that
will
pair
well
with
lots
of
savory
food
pizza
sandwiches
burgers
wonderful
super
drinkable
perhaps
the
perfect
session
brew
oneofakind
beer
very
complex
and
unique
flavors
can
be
found
in
this
one
an
american
classic
be
sure
to
add
this
one
to
the
list
of
beers
to
try
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
but
i
like
it
feels
bubbly
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
the
excellent
drinkability
and
relatively
low
abv
make
this
a
great
session
beer
when
this
stuff
is
fresh
which
can
be
rare
here
on
the
east
coast
this
stuff
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
and
a
real
joy
an
american
original
with
taste
this
beer
could
go
good
with
some
tacos
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
refershing
malt
flavors
of
carmel
and
hop
flavor
as
well
citrus
like
taste
in
the
end
really
nice
and
refershing
taste
is
refreshing
yet
balanced
and
mellow
tough
to
gauge
by
style
since
its
the
only
california
common
beer
ive
ever
seen
it
is
unique
and
well
made
slightlly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
id
try
it
again
especially
to
ward
off
the
indian
summer
were
currently
experiencing
here
in
central
nc
worth
a
try
d
nice
for
a
session
beer
but
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
this
is
pretty
average
a
must
try
beer
oelergud
d
a
great
session
beer
goes
down
super
smooth
light
but
very
pleasant
taste
a
classic
well
made
american
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
despite
there
not
being
distinct
flavors
this
is
a
good
brew
and
if
you
havent
ever
picked
this
up
you
should
do
so
and
give
it
a
try
despite
it
not
being
my
favorite
anchor
beer
the
liberty
ale
is
this
is
solid
found
at
a
convience
store
on
rt
1
in
newcastle
pours
a
deep
gold
color
cant
smell
much
except
a
little
bit
like
a
macro
taste
is
much
better
similar
to
a
pilsner
but
with
more
hoppy
flavor
and
a
slight
citrus
finish
good
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
good
beer
price
kinda
sucks
9
59
for
a
six
pack
but
worth
having
every
once
in
a
while
nicely
carbonated
with
a

this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
anchor
steam
is
an

colour
with
a

aroma
and
flavour
is
a
fairly
even
balance
between
toasted
malt
and
leafy
herbal
hops
its
also
rather
creamy
and
has
some
bubblegum
sweetness
didnt
mind
this

beer
highly
drinkable
the
malt
and
the
smooth
mouth
makes
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
bitter
finish
is
just
a
little
harsh
at
first
not
my
favorite
hops
but
the
malt
is
so
good
served
in
a
pint
glass
pretty
amber
color
with
a
tannishwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
pleasant
malty
sweet
aroma
flavor
is
well
balanced
slightly
bitter
from
the
hops
but
not
overpowering
and
definitely
not
unpleasant
nicely
carbonated
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
this
would
be
a
beer
i
could
drink
very
easily
all
night
drinkability
sure
ill
have
another
a
lot
smoother
than
many
lagers
that
try
too
hard
to
be
too
much
p
s
i
love
this
bottle
shape
overall
a
great
but
not
remarkable
beer
highly
drinkable
and
far
above
average
reccomended
for
sure
anchor
steam
was
amber
in
color
and
clear
and
had
a
nice
head
after
a
few
minutes
only
a
thin
layer
was
left
but
did
leave
some
lacing
there
were
some
hops
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
good
a
light
malt
flavor
with
plenty
of
hops
the
northern
brewer
hops
are
a
nice
change
from
what
im
used
to
it
was
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
poured
to
a
golden
orange
with
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
okay
lacing
aroma
while
not
bad
was
nothing
real
noticeable
flavor
was
okay
and
this
had
a
decent
palate
i
did
not
care
for
this
as
much
as
other
anchor
beers
old
foghorn
and
liberty
but
i
may
have
just
gotten
a
bad
bottle
and
may
very
well
try
again
this
one
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
malty
caramel
aroma
with
some
hop
presence
and
a
little
alcohol
pleasing
grainy
malt
flavour
backed
with
a
good
hop
flavour
almost
woodlike
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
faint
alcohol
warmth
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
this
much
flavour
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
the
beer
that
defines
this
style
how
can
i
take
points
off
of
it
because
it
is
the
style
hmmm
well
i
will
grade
it
based
more
on
my
interpretation
of
the
melding
of
the
flavors
rather
than
how
it
fits
the
category
i
like
it
but
wish
that
the
whole
water
hop
balance
made
it
easier
to
drink
to
my
recollection
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
better
in
san
francisco
so
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
there
eric
poured
a
nice
orangish
gold
color
with
decent
head
decent
retention
good
lacing
smell
was
light
with
classic
malt
seemed
like
some
sweet
tones
as
well
mouthfeel
was
creamy
light
and
crisp
the
steam
beer
had
a
great
crisp
taste
light
and
refreshing
with
its
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
in
excellent
balance
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
d

good
easydrinking
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
not
too
dark
and
with
a
fair
amount
of
visible
carbonation
smells
of
malts
grains
and
some
hops
taste
is
similar
but
with
a
bit
of
added
florals
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
feels
fairly
smooth
but
theres
way
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
decent
betterthanaverage
beer
with
a
nice
taste
but
its
nothing
special
id
probably
get
it
at
a
restaurant
again
but
it
seems
a
bit
expensive
for
what
it
is
in
the
store
quite
drinkable
has
enough
interesting
flavors
to
hold
your
interest
but
also
is
crisp
and
refreshing
along
with
the
franziskaner
one
of
the
bests
readily
available
beers
you
can
buy
anchor
steam
pours
a
very
nice
red
amber
color
along
with
a
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
till
you
finish
your
pint
that
antes
up
the
respect
right
there
the
smell
is
floral
and
has
an
awesomely
balanced
complexion
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
malt
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
with
more
flavor
and
craft
the
taste
is
orgasmic
in
words
has
a
carmellike
initial
flavor
and
then
heeds
way
to
the
malt
which
is
quite
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
heavy
makes
you
think
twice
about
it
being
a
lager
drinkability
is
that
of
a
hefe
in
my
opinion
very
smooth
and
balanced
the
steaming
process
leaves
it
wickedly
smooth
and
i
love
it
anchor
pretty
much
reinvented
this
style
of
beers
from
the
grave
and
its
added
quite
a
unique
beer
to
the
styles
of
beer
from
around
the
world
it
has
the
character
of
a
hefeweizen
and
vienna
lager
which
is
a
good
mix
to
go
with
very
tasty
indeed
on
par
with
a
craft
amber
ale
i
cant
say
i
can
pick
out
the
difference
aside
from
more
hops
looks
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
very
caramel
and
tastes
it
with
a
nicely
balanced
bitterness
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
great
with
rich
food
i
get
a
hint
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
but
thats
really
the
only
bad
thing
i
can
say
cheers
to
this
classic
i
dont
really
know
why
but
i
just
find
it
pretty
awesome
that
this
brewery
developed
their
own
beer
which
eventually
became
a
style
all
its
own
anyway
enough
blabbing
anchor
steam
pours
an
attractive
clear
copper
with
a
smooth
thin
white
lace
heading
smell
was
somehwhat
weak
but
not
bad
at
all
i
picked
up
on
some
malty
biscuit
smells
along
with
a
light
touch
of
honey
and
carmel
taste
was
very
bitter
with
the
dark
carmel
and
honey
flavors
showing
up
somewhere
in
the
middle
not
too
carbonated
or
big
on
the
hops
but
the
malt
bitterness
makes
up
for
it
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
see
this
beer
as
being
somewhat
of
an
acquired
taste
this
is
my
second
sampling
of
the
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
like
it
a
whole
lot
more
then
my
first
time
around
its
one
that
seems
to
keep
growing
on
you
anchor
steam
is
a
great
beer
easy
drinker
id
buy
it
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
d
excellent
flavor
from
a
solid
beer
thats
stood
the
test
of
time
this
is
a
good
beer
and
even
more
drinkable
than
sam
i
like
the
idea
of
lagers
at
ale
temps
but
it
truly
is
subtle
variant
for
a
lager
this
beer
is
a
good
pick
and
id
love
to
do
a
sideby
side
with
the
two
beers
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
good
flavor
for
me
though
it
has
a
bit
too
much
maltiness
to
really
be
viable
for
sessionability
however
as
previously
suggested
by
others
this
is
a
great
beer
for
summertime
so
drink
up
smooth
drinking
beer
and
ultra
unique
definitely
a
solid
brew
for
any
occasion
and
one
that
i
will
be
going
back
to
in
the
near
future
a
must
try
this
is
one
pretty
available
light
and
easily
sessionable
beer
anchor
steam
is
classic
refreshing
beer
its
not
incredibly
complex
but
it
has
distinctive
charactor
were
blessed
anchor
steam
has
survived
when
so
many
other
regional
breweries
have
long
since
failed
anchors
flagship
beer
is
still
good
but
i
suppose
my
tastes
have
changed
i
also
wonder
if
anchor
increased
the
hop
bill
a
bit
since
the
mid
80s
as
i
dont
remember
this
beer
being
quite
so
hoppy
the
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
and
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
that
of
citrus
and
mild
hops
it
is
very
palatable
with
mild
hoppiness
and
light
citrus
undertones
the
mouthfeel
is
substantial
and
a
little
more
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
a
bready
yeast
with
the
aforementioned
nuances
as
i
try
to
partake
of
the
local
offerings
when
visiting
a
city
i
reverted
back
to
anchor
steam
when
a
particular
sf
restaurant
had
a
more
limited
beer
menu
its
superior
drinkability
paired
well
with
food
or
multiple
pints
in
a
session
as
an
aside
it
was
also
nice
to
see
it
in
stores
priced
less
than
10
a
six
pack
even
if
it
had
to
be
in
its
hometown
d
definitely
a
quaffable
session
lager
type
not
my
favorite
style
but
nice
to
go
down
very
cool
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
this
is
good
goes
down
well
very
sessionable
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
chunky
white
head
about
23
fingers
width
head
quickly
recedes
but
leaves
a
moderately
sticky
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
smell
is
slightly
sweet
like
honey
and
malt
and
a
slight
hop
tang
taste
is
a
very
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
one
not
overpowering
the
other
finishes
just
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
im
sure
im
going
to
finish
the
six
pack
this
evening
quite
quaffable
and
refreshing
overall
never
had
a
steam
beer
this
one
presents
like
a
great
pale
ale
with
good
flavor
and
a
good
mouthfeel
very
enjoyable
recommended
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
a
bit
average
in
terms
of
taste
but
a
drinkable
beer
just
the
same
this
was
the
first
steam
beer
id
tried
some
years
ago
and
to
this
day
its
really
the
only
representation
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
i
really
have
no
complaints
and
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
this
is
a
great
session
brew
very
drinkable
i
remember
liking
this
beer
more
than
i
did
this
one
i
will
update
review
this
one
again
when
i
get
a
bottle
that
i
know
is
fresh
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
earthy
malt
taste
is
sweet
toasted
malt
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
that
is
overhyped
in
my
opinion
i
will
probably
not
purchase
this
again
its
tough
to
find
a
fresh
pint
of
this
in
boston
but
when
in
san
fransico
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
more
drinkable
beer
as
far
as
adhearance
to
style
its
much
like
duval
didnt
they
invent
the
style
a
great
alelike
lager
im
sure
the
best
selling
craft
in
america
sam
owes
a
great
deal
of
its
popularity
to
this
predecesor
medium
body
lightened
by
crisp
brisk
carbonation
becomes
very
creamy
as
it
warms
up
im
very
impressed
and
perplexed
this
beer
aint
famous
for
nothin
the
thing
i
love
about
anchor
steam
is
that
it
is
crisp
has
a
little
bit
hop
pop
to
it
and
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
what
you
get
is
a
somewhat
lighter
feeling
beer
that
has
a
very
good
punch
to
it
in
flavor
you
get
a
good
dose
of
hops
on
the
level
of
a
pale
ale
even
but
there
is
a
little
malt
caramel
background
that
sets
it
apart
from
west
coast
pales
a
very
good
refreshing
choice
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
this
type
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
extraordinary
but
very
very
drinkable
certainly
worth
a
try
i
suspect
that
i
have
got
myself
a
skunked
bottle
or
something
here
its
had
to
come
a
long
way
you
understand
on
first
pour
the
beer
looked
beautiful
with
a
nice
coppery
colour
and
decent
head
and
smelt
mildly
of
malt
yeast
it
reminded
me
of
homebrew
the
taste
itself
i
found
quite
subdued
perhaps
what
would
be
expected
in
a
kiwiuk
style
mild
ale
but
the
aftertaste
was
not
to
my
taste
i
found
it
not
only
lingering
but
astringent
and
sourish
like
nothing
i
have
tasted
before
bar
homebrewing
disasters
i
think
i
am
going
to
have
to
reserve
my
judgement
on
this
one
until
i
can
try
a
hopefully
fresher
bottle
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
is
forefront
it
is
highly
carbonated
the
carbonation
can
be
felt
up
to
the
point
where
one
swallows
the
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
that
seems
to
be
a
little
too
much
if
you
ask
me
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
drink
again
but
i
dont
know
how
soon
ill
be
in
the
mood
to
drink
this
beer
again
it
is
something
unique
however
there
are
many
unique
beers
that
i
have
had
that
i
might
prefer
over
this
one
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
hit
the
spot
or
any
spot
like
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
should
if
you
dont
mind
the
bitterness
this
might
be
a
good
choice
for
you
it
doesntfit
my
tastes
and
unfortunatly
wont
go
onto
my
list
of
would
drink
again
beers
certainly
the
best
american
beer
i
ever
had
an
incomparable
one
it
came
on
a
hot
sunny
afternoon
and
made
my
day
hazy
and
crisp
hoppy
and
smooth
all
in
one
fantastic
drink
i
wish
it
would
be
exported
more
widely
anchor
steam
can
easily
beat
dozens
of
european
premium
lagers
but
if
san
franciscan
brewers
decide
not
to
expand
production
for
quality
reasons
i
can
understand
miss
this
beer
really
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
excellent
allaround
beer
that
would
compliment
most
styles
of
food
or
stand
out
well
on
its
own
best
backyard
drink
ive
had
and
i
usually
try
to
keep
a
couple
in
stock
for
those
times
i
dont
know
what
else
to
have
firm
maltiness
and
delicious
earthy
hop
flavors
blend
together
cleanly
to
make
a
pleasant
and
highly
drinkable
lager
high
on
my
list
of
allpurpose
session
beers
very
solid
beer
i
could
drink
this
beer
frequently
and
have
been
known
to
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
deep
ambercopper
hue
the
head
is
fluffy
white
and
dissapates
quite
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
weak
grains
very
faint
the
taste
is
o
little
bitter
in
the
front
and
in
the
back
there
is
the
balance
of
malt
and
hop
in
the
body
but
they
just
impress
the
total
brew
could
be
a
decent
stand
by
at
the
bar
where
not
much
else
is
going
on
probably
the
only
one
of
this
style
that
ive
had
and
i
could
just
not
know
what
im
looking
for
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
all
year
round
but
especially
during
the
warm
months
pours
a
copper
amber
gold
color
with
a
14
white
head
that
quickly
dissapated
mild
hops
and
fruit
in
the
nose
maybe
bannana
taste
is
very
simple
but
good
easy
to
drink
with
a
mild
hop
finish
very
dry
in
the
mouth
possibly
the
most
drinkable
beer
that
ive
ever
had
its
just
so
smooth
recommended
had
this
last
night
at
a
germanstyle
restaurant
i
got
this
kind
of
as
an
appitizer
tasty
this
was
my
first
beer
from
anchor
this
is
just
overall
a
great
beer
really
for
any
occasion
it
went
down
smoothly
and
had
an
exceptional
finish
the
frothy
head
lasted
all
the
way
down
and
left
a
nice
lace
throughout
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
was
the
first
american
craft
beer
i
ever
tasted
thanks
to
elricorico
and
i
enjoy
returning
for
a
visit
here
and
there
i
got
this
beer
in
a
bottle
and
it
came
with
a
frosty
mug
once
in
the
mug
the
beer
looked
a
light
amber
at
first
it
had
a
nice
frothy
head
that
soon
dissipated
to
nothing
it
smelled
of
a
fresh
cut
lemon
and
a
bitter
hops
with
a
few
oats
in
the
background
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
watery
red
grapefruit
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
lingered
far
too
long
lacking
carbonation
this
beer
had
a
very
thin
mouth
feel
to
it
over
all
i
thought
i
could
do
with
out
ever
drinking
an
entire
bottle
again
however
i
could
take
a
swig
here
and
there
with
out
being
totally
offended
poured
a
medium
copper
color
woth
slightly
off
white
chunky
head
smell
is
a
very
enjoyable
combination
of
malt
with
citrus
notes
taste
follows
through
with
a
good
malty
character
and
a
mild
lemony
note
finishes
with
a
good
refreshing
taste
that
is
supremely
enjoyable
hard
to
believe
i
never
had
this
beer
before
i
will
definitely
visit
it
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
i
didnt
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
not
sure
ive
ever
had
another
steam
beer
so
my
ratings
pretty
much
only
reflect
how
i
feel
about
the
beer
in
conclusion
for
a
lager
that
is
fairly
light
in
color
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
there
is
nothing
more
refreshing
than
drinking
an
anchor
steam
on
a
hot
day
yes
even
outta
the
bottle
or
more
classic
a
microbrewed
taste
than
this
beer
this
was
one
of
my
first
microbrews
and
i
fell
in
love
with
it
immediately
it
says
anchor
steam
to
you
while
you
consume
it
slightly
malty
on
the
front
mild
hoppy
kickback
great
session
beer
great
starter
for
a
new
microdrinker
nice
head
upon
the
poor
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
an
alltime
classic
nice
copper
color
with
just
a
bit
haze
to
it
fingers
worth
of
creamy
head
the
smell
was
hard
to
find
slight
malt
scent
in
the
distance
but
nothing
really
pops
out
nice
and
creamy
feel
to
it
a
semisweet
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
citrus
on
the
finish
nicely
balanced
almost
fullbodied
brew
that
goes
down
easy
i
only
wish
the
aroma
would
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
the
characteristics
drinkability
i
cant
drink
this
too
much
something
about
this
makes
it
a
bit
undrinkable
once
it
is
halfway
through
the
glass
still
a
good
beer
a
very
good
beer
overall
certainly
not
worth
the
price
but
very
good
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
they
might
have
to
become
a
go
to
beer
for
the
summer
ill
definately
be
coming
back
to
this
one
perhaps
fairly
often
tasty
brew
da
little
tart
and
makes
your
mouth
water
and
your
cheeks
pucker
recomend
it
once
has
it
changed
or
has
my
taste
changed
drinkability
is
very
good
a
good
session
beer
ive
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
i
had
to
try
it
no
complaints
the
creaminess
definitely
puts
it
in
a
category
by
itself
this
beer
doesnt
give
you
anything
spectacular
but
the
taste
is
really
unique
and
its
one
you
can
drink
frequently
and
not
get
sick
of
it
overall
a
nice
refreshing
and
flavorful
beer
clean
and
well
balanced
not
my
favorite
of
anchors
offerings
but
a
fine
beer
anyway
pretty
good
a
perfect
session
beer
musings
one
of
my
favorites
the
accustomed
taste
is
like
a
train
wreck
to
get
thru
at
first
but
then
becomes
one
of
your
best
friends
highly
refreshing
and
interesting
d
very
tasty
session
beer
not
overly
hopped
easy
to
go
down
its
not
a
character
of
aroma
or
taste
i
can
really
identify
not
that
its
all
that
mystical
but
it
is
a
bridge
style
i
like
it
but
i
dont
drinkability
very
drinkable
grab
yourself
a
six
pack
enjoy
the
day
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
not
comparable
to
any
standard
beer
guess
this
is
hardly
a
love
at
first
sight
but
once
you
start
liking
it
poured
into
a
pint
color
is
a
deep
clear
amber
with
an
inch
of
creamy
off
white
foam
that
dissipates
to
quarter
inch
well
sustained
by
a
constant
rising
carbonation
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
taken
to
the
nose
aromas
are
of
grain
earthy
some
fruity
notes
and
slightly
bready
qualities
raw
grainy
flavors
come
first
and
quickly
then
some
bitter
earthiness
and
a
slighty
citric
and
bitter
hop
finish
interesting
floral
flavor
here
and
there
this
is
a
very
unique
and
neat
beer
an
in
yo
face
grainyraw
ride
full
of
character
and
intrigue
just
a
great
beer
slàinte
d
definetly
a
sessionable
beer
and
something
i
always
have
on
hand
for
friends
i
have
no
idea
why
i
didnt
review
this
earlier
ive
had
this
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
quite
a
while
now
a
good
beer
overall
a
decent
example
of
a
uniquely
american
style
it
was
okay
to
share
this
with
an
austrian
friend
who
had
never
had
this
style
before
but
i
dont
think
id
be
purchasing
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
would
rather
have
anchors
liberty
ale
as
my
tastes
lean
towards
the
american
pale
style
also
too
much
good
homebrew
to
drink
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
1
finger
head
lasting
5
seconds
i
love
the
color
of
this
brew
it
looks
exceptional
at
first
sip
it
tasted
somewhat
like
an
ale
but
later
it
subsided
to
a
malty
taste
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
i
will
find
out
tonight
not
too
much
in
the
aftertaste
but
quite
refreshing
it
is
a
little
hard
to
describe
this
beer
but
i
will
take
my
best
shot
there
was
almost
no
head
at
all
could
have
been
the
way
the
bartender
poured
it
taste
was
decent
but
i
dont
think
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
lot
of
them
if
you
are
going
out
to
dinner
i
would
definetly
suggest
it
if
they
have
it
on
tap
this
is
the
beer
that
changed
my
attitude
about
beer
very
drinkable
makes
an
excellent
and
refreshing
session
beer
but
its
can
be
an
acquired
taste
for
some
folks
serving
this
beer
too
cold
can
make
for
a
bitter
experience
very
drinkable
worth
a
try
i
can
always
drink
one
or
six
of
these
this
is
the
standard
for
the
style
as
they
created
it
ive
never
found
the
california
common
style
very
interesting
which
i
guess
is
why
i
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
to
now
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
much
that
makes
it
stand
out
other
interpretations
that
are
good
tend
to
rely
on
good
malt
character
or
interesting
hops
the
character
of
lagerataletemp
yeast
just
doesnt
produce
interesting
flavors
in
my
opinion
a
simple
uncomplicated
beer
with
no
real
negative
traits
a
sensible
session
beer
choice
favored
over
many
equally
low
abv
beers
that
can
only
claim
a
fraction
of
the
quality
i
had
great
expectations
for
this
beer
and
its
legendary
status
which
perhaps
is
why
it
turned
out
to
be
a
disappointement
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
is
far
better
than
a
pale
tasteless
macro
beer
but
compared
to
what
i
expected
it
was
bland
i
wanted
more
perfume
more
scent
more
magic
what
i
got
was
fine
ontap
served
in
a
pint
glass
copper
hue
slim
head
of
white
foam
good
carbonation
present
the
aroma
was
quite
faint
with
a
light
maltiness
the
taste
is
nice
not
particularly
sweet
but
somewhat
nutty
and
semibitter
alcohol
does
not
appear
strong
crisp
mouthfeel
and
finish
light
bodied
but
not
watery
it
goes
down
easy
this
has
always
been
a
very
reliable
session
beer
especially
when
there
isnt
much
else
to
choose
from
a
classic
very
dark
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
which
is
made
of
various
seized
bubbles
and
has
some
retention
malty
aroma
that
with
herbs
almost
medicinal
dark
chocolate
and
coffee

nice
dry
finish
that
balances
the
flavor
profile
nicely
very
chewy
and
round
wonderfully
soft
overall
it
is
a
decent
session
beer
cheers
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
lively
and
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
just
wouldnt
ever
think
of
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
anchor
steam
pours
a
golden
amber
color
and
mine
had
a
thin
off
white
head
that
left
a
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
has
a
musky
sweet
smell
of
malts
with
ample
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
beer
seems
to
have
malty
characters
that
hit
the
pallet
first
and
in
the
body
significant
hop
characterskinda
resiny
the
aftertaste
is
fairly
smooth
but
bitter
at
the
same
time
i
felt
like
the
bitterness
was
really
strong
but
as
you
drink
the
beer
it
becomes
much
less
prominent
mouthfeel
nice
balance
of
maltshops
the
drinkablity
grows
as
you
drink
it
i
always
want
another
when
i
finish
the
first
i
had
this
conception
that
i
really
wasnt
a
fan
of
lagers
but
to
my
surprise
this
is
a
lager
it
has
really
changed
my
perception
i
plan
on
experimenting
with
the
variety
a
little
more
its
smooth
and
slightly
dry
and
just
oh
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
for
friends
and
a
wonderful
session
beer
to
have
on
hand
this
is
a
true
original
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
is
a
pleasing
sweet
malty
aroma
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
of
malts
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
low
carbonation
and
dry
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
good
session
beer
to
me
nice
coppery
color
with
good
clarity
wonderful
malty
caramel
smell
malt
flavor
prominent
smooth
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
not
as
hoppy
but
with
good
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
without
being
bitter
could
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
porper
for
the
style
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
steam
beer
from
anchor
that
really
would
be
nice
on
a
nice
warm
day
or
even
as
a
nice
drink
after
a
long
day
at
work
a
good
all
around
beer
for
the
beer
geek
or
the
average
beer
drinker
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
and
has
active
carbonation
drinkability
this
is
what
a
beer
should
taste
like
could
drink
these
in
a
session
matter
of
fact
i
think
i
will
now
d
the
drinkability
here
is
high
this
is
a
very
quaffable
brew
this
beer
poured
a
golden
amber
with
an
ample
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
a
thin
film
the
whole
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
pale
malts
the
taste
is
a
very
strong
taste
of
pale
malts
but
it
is
balanced
nicely
with
some
subtle
hops
there
is
a
good
thickness
and
some
strong
carbonation
that
complements
this
beer
nicely
overall
a
highly
drinkable
and
very
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
special
note
do
not
drink
this
beer
too
cold
like
many
beers
and
wines
the
flavors
and
aromas
must
be
allowed
to
breathe
if
you
dont
mind
warm
beer
this
would
probably
be
best
at
room
temperature
i
dont
see
why
i
couldnt
have
another
one
overall
its
a
relatively
unique
taste
but
a
good
one
overall
just
a
solid
american
beer
cant
go
wrong
with
it
great
balance
mmmm
good
smells
goodnice
carmally
aroma
that
really
is
a
good
indication
of
what
im
about
to
taste
pours
a
big
pillowy
head
and
theres
a
good
stiff
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
the
taste
is
really
very
good
i
thinkits
got
a
carmally
hoppiness
if
that
makes
sense
and
it
just
feels
very
full
and
substantial
in
my
mouth
and
on
my
tastebuds
i
really
liked
thisgood
balance
and
fleshed
out
you
ever
say
to
yourself
i
just
want
something
that
tastes
like
beer
that
is
the
place
this
beer
has
in
my
heart
it
pours
out
with
a
tiny
white
head
the
body
is
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
like
the
streams
in
a
belgian
but
nice
and
well
beer
like
it
has
a
very
clean
beer
smell
a
light
melon
like
hop
and
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
this
beer
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
with
flavor
delicious
hint
of
fruit
but
mostly
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
the
hops
have
a
couple
of
layers
the
first
flavor
i
taste
is
very
fruity
but
it
opens
into
a
peppery
flavor
as
it
goes
down
and
just
after
the
flavor
comes
out
as
a
pineycitrusy
flavor
very
fun
to
drink
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
jack
of
all
trades
of
beers
you
could
drink
it
as
a
lawnmower
gusler
or
a
sipping
evening
beer
goes
great
with
food
too
a
light
drinkable
and
unobtrusive
offering
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
in
terms
of
flavor
but
a
version
very
indicative
of
the
style
taste
is
pretty
refreshing
clean
with
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
decent
going
down
fairly
easy
to
drink
id
order
another
this
is
good
beer
easily
a
session
beer
of
great
weight
ill
drink
it
again
for
sure
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
average
nothing
particularly
notable
interesting
beer
worth
a
tasting
for
sure
this
is
quite
a
unique
beer
lovely
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
aroma
is
rahter
faint
taste
is
very
difficult
to
describe
first
thing
noticed
is
bitterness
of
hops
not
fruity
or
citrusy
at
all
next
comes
a
toasty
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
extremely
high
great
session
beer
this
beer
is
so
unique
that
i
find
the
flavors
very
difficult
to
describe
i
just
know
that
i
like
it
a
lot
highly
reccomended
clear
medium
copper
with
a
small
bumpy
head
and
many
columns
of
carbonation
nose
is
a
powdery
collection
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
taste
is
smooth
wellbalanced
with
a
very
mild
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
firm
body
nothing
offputting
at
all
in
this
highly
sessionable
brew
get
it
enjoy
it
d
pretty
bad
i
passed
off
the
second
half
of
my
bomber
it
just
wasnt
an
enjoyable
brew
i
dont
know
about
food
pairings
i
think
there
might
be
something
with
which
it
would
be
sucessfully
paired
but
i
cannot
envision
it
might
be
the
barleywine
that
i
just
drank
sessionable
no
not
at
all
it
is
weak
enough
for
sure
but
the
aftertaste
destroys
the
prospect
of
sessioning
this
beer
although
i
liked
the
beer
very
much
the
full
body
prevents
me
from
drinking
another
one
in
the
near
future
the
style
is
just
in
between
a
very
drinkable
beer
like
koninck
or
palm
and
a
speciality
brew
like
westmalle
dubble
from
which
one
is
enough
that
is
why
i
gave
an
average
rating
for
drinkability
i
think
this
beer
is
due
a
better
rating
than
what
i
see
this
is
a
good
session
beer
to
have
on
the
menu
da
little
disappointed
in
this
onei
had
in
on
tap
in
college
and
remember
liking
it
much
more
than
i
did
in
this
bottle
that
being
said
i
will
try
to
find
it
on
tap
perhaps
at
old
chicago
and
rereview
to
be
fair
this
beer
gets
a
5
not
because
it
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
or
my
favorite
but
simply
based
on
the
style
this
is
the
original
the
very
first
steamca
common
beer
and
it
is
the
one
that
all
imitations
are
based
upon
a
true
classic
drinkabilitydefinitely
a
refreshing
session
brew
prefect
for
summer
afternoons
at
the
ballpark
crystal
clear
amber
light
yet
persistent
carbonation
greyish
yellow
foam
cap
yeasty
bread
dough
and
crisp
astringent
hop
aromas
angular
maltiness
with
fruityyeasty
links
to
a
citric
bitter
hop
finish
clean
crisp
and
juicy
and
light
in
body
out
of
this
world
drinkability
but
im
usually
satisfied
by
just
one
props
to
the
og
mr
maytag
this
is
a
great
steam
beer
one
of
the
original
of
its
kind
it
is
well
worth
every
penny
of
it
in
fact
while
out
in
sf
try
to
go
to
the
brewery
there
this
is
surely
a
great
beer
and
visit
a
must
have
drinkability
like
other
anchor
brews
that
unique
airy
mouthfeel
dominated
the
experience
for
me
and
im
not
very
fond
of
it
it
doesnt
seem
to
blend
well
with
the
rest
of
this
beer
an
american
classic
to
be
sure
just
not
for
me
pours
an
exceptionally
clear
deep
reddish
brown
amber
into
a
pint
glass
thick
foamy
head
lasted
for
a
short
while
before
falling
to
moderate
cream
colored
lacing
this
particular
lager
is
exceptionally
complex
in
both
smell
and
flavor
scent
is
hoppy
citrusy
and
floral
tastes
caramelly
sweet
hoppy
and
fruity
finished
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
dry
this
is
one
of
my
newfound
favorite
beers
will
seek
out
in
the
future
would
consider
a
new
favorite
session
beer
almost
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
goes
down
very
well
finshing
clean
with
a
light
bitterness
being
my
first
california
common
i
must
say
this
is
an
excellent
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
the
opportunity
popped
up
to
give
it
a
shot
i
respect
the
makers
of
this
beer
and
its
bretheren
going
way
back
to
the
1800s
very
drinkable
this
is
a
beautiful
session
beer
imo
which
is
good
because
i
get
it
here
in
big
650ml
bottles
what
a
classic
beer
there
is
an
homage
to
this
beer
at
the
magic
hat
brewery
in
burlington
vermont
and
it
is
clear
why
the
taste
is
light
but
still
full
with
a
crisp
malt
to
it
drinking
it
is
really
easy
especially
if
you
are
used
to
seeking
out
the
more
extreme
varieties
of
beer
its
a
welcomed
change
the
smell
has
hints
of
wheat
in
it
but
the
carmalized
notes
peek
through
as
well
at
one
time
this
was
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
available
to
beer
drinkers
for
what
its
worth
it
really
is
a
good
drinking
beer
goes
good
with
food
or
not
i
would
choose
this
over
pilsnersexportscanadians
and
of
course
the
bmc
conglomerates
this
is
a
very
expensive
session
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
averagesized
white
head
that
leaves
modest
lace
the
aroma
is
mild
but
toasty
malts
fallowed
by
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
somewhere
between
a
lager
and
an
esb
hop
bitterness
overtakes
the
caramel
malts
but
nothing
is
terribly
assertive
this
is
one
of
the
beers
if
not
the
beer
that
started
the
craft
beer
revolution
in
america
so
it
deserves
its
props
and
its
one
hell
of
a
session
brew
to
boot
notes
i
have
never
had
a
california
commonsteam
beer
before
but
this
example
is
pretty
good
i
would
recommend
at
least
trying
it
as
it
is
a
historic
brew
and
a
solid
beer
of
its
style
apparently
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
has
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
excellent
retention
and
a
nice
coating
of
lace
on
the
glass
afterwards
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
low
in
hops
at
first
earthy
roasted
malt
with
a
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
this
beer
seems
to
be
their
standard
bearer
but
ill
take
their
much
hoppier
liberty
ale
over
this
any
day
mouthfeel
was
cleansing
with
medium
carbonation
overall
it
was
quite
different
than
i
remember
it
has
been
over
a
decade
since
i
last
had
this
brew
not
nearly
as
exciting
but
this
may
have
to
do
with
the
vast
amount
of
other
beers
i
have
since
tasted
for
those
who
have
not
expanded
their
beer
horizons
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
of
a
good
american
beer
mouthfeel
kind
of
light
on
the
tongue
and
slightly
thin
but
this
is
according
to
style
and
is
actually
quite
quenching
when
paired
with
the
lighter
flavor
of
this
beer
sessionable
by
the
gallons
not
merely
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
but
arguably
one
of
the
best
american
beers
on
the
market
ive
said
it
before
in
various
forum
posts
and
ill
say
it
again
this
wellbalanced
infinitely
drinkable
brew
is
the
perfect
session
beer
no
one
can
claim
to
be
a
serious
craft
beer
lover
and
never
have
tried
this
one
highly
highly
recommended
she
got
a
body
that
licks
creamy
and
is
no
way
flat
m
d
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
bitterhas
excellent
balance
drinkability
is
exceptionally
good
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
session
as
they
are
easy
drinking
and
very
tasty
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
overall
ok
but
nothing
special
and
not
worth
the
price
charged
at
the
lcbo
if
you
can
get
it
locally
though
go
for
it
its
easy
to
forget
about
this
one
but
i
make
sure
to
get
some
every
few
months
or
so
my
dad
says
he
used
to
get
this
in
the
70s
he
still
does
things
werent
so
bad
in
70s
for
beer
if
this
was
around
a
good
beer
to
chose
if
you
had
to
pick
one
to
be
stuck
on
a
deserted
island
overall
kinda
reminds
me
of
an
oktoberfest
with
the
malty
backbone
pretty
nice
beer
overall
not
a
favorite
but
a
really
nice
clean
taste
tastes
much
better
this
is
obviously
a
wellmade
brew
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
expected
quite
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
hops
a
major
flavor
with
a
sweet
caramel
taste
also
a
fruity
flavor
and
finishes
a
little
dry
i
like
this
beer
now
i
know
why
people
have
recommended
it
over
the
years
the
taste
is
a
good
combination
of
lighter
malts
with
a
full
body
flavor
creamy
almost
but
with
a
hint
of
caramel
flavoring
and
then
at
the
end
a
spicy
kick
a
small
amount
of
floral
is
noticeable
but
you
have
to
look
for
it
anchor
steam
is
a
nice
summer
beer
and
has
a
fantastic
history
if
you
have
the
time
i
suggest
to
peak
around
their
web
site
and
check
the
history
pours
a
clear
medium
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
that
has
very
good
retention
some
sparse
spotty
lacing
the
smell
is
of
perfumy
fruit
and
grain
the
taste
is
rather
mild
and
a
bit
sweet
up
front
with
a
good
balance
and
a
pleasant
fruity
lemony
light
bitter
finish
it
has
a
thinmedium
body
lightly
dry
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
there
was
a
slight
sourness
in
there
that
i
didnt
care
that
much
for
but
otherwise
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
brew
that
i
enjoyed
d
i
couldnt
drink
as
many
steam
beers
as
i
could
drink
their
liberty
ale
but
i
could
definately
go
through
a
few
of
these
and
be
quite
happy
that
i
did
pours
incredibly
deep
copper

a
finger
of
head
taht
falls
slightly
to
a
healthy
foam
over
top
the
nose
is
lightly
grainy
light
caramel
overall
it
is
not
an
overly
aromatic
brew
flavor
is
prominently
grainy
with
a
light
caramel
a
light
hop
bitter
hangs
on
the
finish
nothing
really
grabs
me
and
keeps
my
interest
though
this
would
be
a
good
transition
brew
for
those
just
fining
craft
beer
feel
is
moderate
with
a
very
active
bubble
on
my
tongue
the
beer
is
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
grainy
nature
of
it
there
is
nothing
flawed
in
it
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
and
should
go
well
with
almost
any
kind
of
food
anchor
you
son
of
a
bitch
youve
done
it
again
thanks
pours
a
tawny
light
brown
with
a
vague
clarity
a
dense
two
finger
head
has
nice
retention
and
average
lacing
spicy
hop
nose
with
hints
of
lightly
toasted
sweet
malt
id
like
to
say
the
assertive
hop
bitterness
is
well
balanced
with
the
mildy
vinous
citrus
flavor
but
i
cant
judge
the
style
until
i
review
more
of
the
same
i
can
say
that
the
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
make
up
a
mostly
smooth
mouthfeel
but
the
spicehop
bite
lingers
and
dries
the
finish
enough
to
make
the
average
rating
for
drinkability
generous
notes
good
all
around
beer
cant
go
wrong
with
it
drinkability
easily
poundable
nothing
exciting
and
nothing
off
either
ive
never
had
a
steam
beer
before
tastes
like
a
solid
lager
to
me
lagers
arent
my
favorite
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
once
pours
a
reddishgolden
amber
with
a
finger
of
khaki
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
heavy
on
the
toasted
grain
and
caramel
malts
taste
continues
with
the
toasted
barley
malts
caramel
a
sliver
of
citrus
and
an
elusive
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
medium
bodied
and
moderately
crisp
tastes
like
prototypical
lager
a
lot
like
sprechers
lagers
drinkable
for
days
but
nothing
too
exciting
never
been
much
of
a
lager
fan
but
this
was
tasty
enough
i
suppose
enough
character
to
keep
me
interested
its
been
nearly
a
decade
since
ive
had
anchor
steam
i
revisted
the
classic
this
evening
the
steam
poured
a
nice
copperlike
color
with
a
proud
head
that
left
decent
lacing
early
on
initial
smell
is
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
tang
in
the
front
same
carried
over
to
the
taste
this
is
a
very
nice
straightforward
and
historic
american
brew
its
a
must
try
pours
a
copper
color
with
soapy
foam
that
leaves
behind
bits
of
lacing
i
detect
a
roasted
toasty
character
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
first
taste
is
unique
to
say
the
least
very
distinct
roasted
malt
is
upfront
with
a
pepper
spice
aftertaste
my
mouth
is
left
dry
and
refreshed
but
this
brew
is
rather
biting
i
e
powerful
and
flavorful
some
bitterness
in
the
tate
but
not
on
the
magnitude
of
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
an
interesting
history
worth
of
a
few
pints
the
beer
dispenses
from
the
12ounce
brown
stubby
bottle
a
crystal
clear
deep
amber
with
a
personable
creamy
light
tan
head
that
last
for
eons
before
dissolving
leaving
a
fine
coating
of
lace
to
conceal
the

the

the

medium

a
pleasing
acidity
and
the

delightful
in
their
spicy
presence
dry
aftertaste
a
pleasant
beer
on
a
still
hot
sunday
afternoon
in
phoenix
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
wth
a
full
head
and
a
clear
dark
coppery
color
the
smell
is
oka
pretty
full
spice
and
ale
mix
with
a
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
with
malt
and
citrus
flavors
the
flavors
are
very
unique
a
can
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
tailgating
perhaps
this
goes
down
so
easy
i
think
ill
have
another
cheers
smell
is
light
and
clean
and
understated
nutty
malt
i
taste
it
and
it
really
strikes
me
as
bland
no
hops
to
speak
of
it
is
a
very
pleasant
texture
but
boring
flavor
between
light
and
medium
in
body
softly
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
ill
stick
with
my
ales
thank
you
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
bite
to
it
sticks
to
the
back
of
the
throat
a
very
summery
beer
this
says
west
coast
to
me
in
a
big
way
even
though
i
havent
much
experience
with
this
style
im
already
a
bit
of
a
fan
classic
old
style
label
and
the
stubby
bottle
anchor
steam
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
it
pours
a
dark
coppery
orange
color
clear
and
clean
with
a
short
but
thick
head
of
off
white
foam
the
head
does
shrink
away
and
it
is
just
a
bit
too
thin
to
leave
any
lace
there
is
a
strong
barley
malt
aroma
with
some
earthy
characteristics
in
the
smell
of
caramel
and
nuts
similar
to
oa
brown
ale
similar
taste
of
malt
and
some
clean
hop
bitterness
rich
and
full
bodied
but
still
quite
refreshing
pleasantly
ssuprised
with
this
one
it
came
out
a
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
size
head
of
foam
that
left
some
lacing
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
much
of
a
smell
with
this
beer
except
for
some
malts
with
a
fruity
background
some
smell
is
better
than
no
smell
the
taste
you
get
is
the
the
lager
first
than
the
ale
second
it
is
a
crisp
malted
hops
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
light
without
being
a
light
beer
and
with
some
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
that
everybody
should
try
for
themselves
it
would
also
make
a
nice
summer
session
beer
i
dont
doubt
this
is
spot
on
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
thing
in
the
world
but
definitely
has
its
place
in
the
beer
spectrum
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
head
is
moderate
with
o
k
retention
and
not
much
lacing
color
is
just
a
deaper
red
than
peach
smell
is
faintly
caramel
taste
is
well
carbonated
crisp
and
slightly
sweet
toast
and
caramel
come
to
mind
light
on
the
hops
and
fairly
balanced
refreshing
and
conducive
to
nice
bouts
of
belching
mouthfeel
is
just
thick
enough
and
pretty
drinkable
great
example
of
an
allamerican
lager
type
beer
fits
right
in
with
lagers
and
pilsners
on
the
drinkability
factor
definitely
will
revisit
on
many
a
warm
summer
night
d
this
beer
does
have
interesting
qualities
of
both
lagers
and
ales
and
is
a
very
smooth
beer
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
complexity
to
hold
my
interest
anchor
steam
is
widely
accepted
as
the
classic
example
of
a
california
common
it
features
a
atrong
caramel
malt
aroma
and
flavor
a
refreshing
bitternes
but
not
too
much
steam
is
crystal
clear
copper
orange
with
some
darker
hues
always
and
acceptable
beer
in
my
house
i
could
sense
a
vegetable
like
aftertaste
that
followed
a
slightly
fruity
beginning
a
very
good
beer
but
very
expensive
worth
a
try
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
a
nice
reminder
the
taste
of
the
lager
yeast
is
very
prominent
reminding
me
of
yuengling
lager
especially
toward
the
end
of
the
pint
when
the
taste
became
heavy
dominant
and
overwhelming
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
there
were
some
hints
of
strawberries
and
a
tinge
of
malty
sweetness
on
a
few
swigs
when
the
pint
was
half
full
or
half
empty
since
im
giving
a
negative
review
but
that
was
a
brief
respite
from
the
experience
of
swigging
this
beer
steam
aka
california
common
is
a
style
unto
itself
i
dont
have
much
interest
in
it
based
on
this
beer
it
tastes
more
or
less
like
a
generic
lager
im
not
surprised
there
arent
many
brewers
working
in
this
style
this
beer
uses
lager
yeast
and
was
brewed
at
ale
temperatures
unique
genre
steam
not
ale
not
lager
but
the
best
of
both
worlds
flavorful
and
clean
and
refreshing
the
only
important
atribute
with
this
beer
is
its
exquisite
balance
of
hops
and
malt
this
balance
carries
through
to
every
facet
of
the
tasting
process
the
end
result
is
lots
of
flavor
and
lots
of
drinkability
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
is
sure
to
satisfy
most
who
dont
prefer
one
extreme
or
another
my
personal
review
on
the
brand
anchor
owns
the
rights
to
the
name
steam
this
is
like
owning
the
word
ale
this
is
absurd
and
usually
unnoticed
so
if
you
can
find
a
steam
beer
of
equivelant
quality
buy
it
instead
i
love
this
beer
with
all
of
my
heart
too
bad
it
costs
8
a
six
anchor
steam
is
a
refreshing
enjoyable
beer
and
virtually
the
only
example
of
its
style
on
the
market
it
may
be
slightly
overrated
due
to
its
cult
classic
status
on
the
other
hand
it
did
singlehandedly
keep
a
style
alive
overall
its
a
good
crossover
craft
beer
pours
a
semiclear
pale
red
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
hints
of
spices
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
too
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
its
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
have
decided
to
delete
my
previous
rating
because
im
sure
i
got
spoiled
samples
the
sample
i
am
tasting
now
was
bought
from
a
hotel
consignment
according
to
the
date
code
this
beer
is
3
weeks
old
this
was
fresh
tasting
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
2
finger
cap
which
retains
a
good
lace
on
the
glass
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
sweet
crystalcaramel
malts
and
grassy
hops
very
pronounced
aromas
full
bodied
beer
chewy
toasty
malts
with
spicy
hopping
that
goes
slightly
drying
in
the
finish
and
lightly
bitter
in
the
after
taste
all
in
all
this
a
good
session
beer
well
made
quaffable
full
bodied
and
satisfying
the
ol
standard
eh
well
it
did
have
a
nice
pour
amber
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
only
a
slight
malt
aroma
but
the
taste
not
good
not
much
in
the
way
of
malts
or
hop
just
some
earthy
slightly
bitter
flavor
kinda
flat
in
the
mouth
boy
overall
a
dull
boring
lager
wasnt
offensive
but
didnt
do
anything
for
me
this
is
a
unique
and
in
my
opinion
an
above
average
beer
lots
of
character
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
almost
creamy
i
could
have
a
good
amount
of
this
12
oz

chilled
in

malts
and
floralspicy
hops
that
leave
a
mild
bitterness
the
beer
poured
a
fine
amber
with
an
eggshell
head
the
aroma
was
a
blast
of
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
of
hoppy
malt
with
many
floral
and
fuit
hints
in
the
finish
the
feel
was
a
full
bodied
beer
that
was
fairly
oily
with
a
well
proportioned
hop
finish
this
was
a
pleasant
experience
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
it
went
well
with
the
meal
providing
a
nice
counterpart
to
calimari
and
fish
giving
a
good
cleansing
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
one
of
the
first
micros
i
bought
in
ca

not
last
long
very
light

if
any

all
nice

with
a
great
light
taste
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
very
drinkable
appearance
is
reddish
brown
with
a
beige
head
of
thick
foam
that
lasts
and
sticks
to
the
glass
aroma
contains
loam
and
malt
and
brown
sugar
initial
taste
is
a
smackdown
of
bitter
hops
and
citrus
so
much
flavor
followed
by
a
complex
and
fairly
bitter
finish
that
lingers
reminding
you
that
there
was
a
barley
and
malt
explosion
on
your
tongue
but
a
merciful
lemon
to
cleanse
the
palate
drinkability
very
good
good
taste
without
numbing

i
keep
finding
flavors
here
that
remind
me
of
both
pale
ales
and
germanstyle
vienna
lagers
or
richer
oktoberfestbiers
very
drinkable
enjoyable
and
effortless
in
its
sessionability
the
rustic
charm
of
grassy
hops
strained
yeast
and
somewhat
clumbsy
brewing
practices
are
also
what
gives
this
hybrid
beer
its
charm
light

simple
well
made
beer
classic
style
i
have
since
seen
the
light
anchor
steam
is
a
wonderful
beer
first
of
all
its
bottle
shape
and
label
design
are
perfect
and
once
in
the
glass
it
looks
about
as
beautiful
as
a
beer
can
look
perfect
amber
color
slightly
cloudier
than
the
old
scratch
with
a
nice
white
head
it
smells
and
tastes
very
creamy
feels
full
and
soft
and
is
quite
refreshing
slight
bitter
aftertaste
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
a
classic
drinkability
very
good
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
an
interesting
blend
of
hops
and
malt
but
the
hoppybitter
bite
is
a
little
harsh
for
my
liking
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
at
a
fish
and
chips
joint
in
crescent
city
ca
and
went
really
well
with
my
meal
but
ive
had
it
a
few
times
since
and
cant
say
id
consider
it
much
more
than
an
average
session
beer
feels
nice
goes
down
smooth
highly
drinkable
i
know
im
in
the
minortybut
i
just
did
not
like
this
beer
for
me
it
was
way
to
creamy
tasting
i
thought
the
head
was
never
going
to
go
away
there
has
been
a
lot
of
hype
about
this
beerand
i
guess
is
was
expecting
more
it
was
average
at
best
sometimes
with
all
the
beers
a
ba
tries
some
just
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
this
one
reminded
me
of
how
much
i
liked
it
the
first
time
around
pours
a
amber
with
gold
streaks
the
head
is
creamy
and
2
inches
thick
the
aroma
is
of
summer
fruit
and
light
barley
hints
of
floral
lace
the
nose
the
taste
is
classic
session
the
floral
aroma
blends
well
with
the
creamy
buttered
malt
this
is
the
ultimate
summer
beverage
very
nice
session
brew
here
pours
a
light
amber
with
very
light
head
taste
is
of
currants
and
hops
you
gotta
love
the
tradition
of
this
beer
being
one
of
the
first
craft
brews
in
the
u
s
rich
in
tradition
and
smooth
taste
and
possibly
the
best
label
of
any
beer
this
ones
a
definite
keeper
one
finger
head
grabs
the
side
of
the
glass
and
hangs
on
respectably
well
copper
color
crisp
fruity
smell
and
taste
highly
bittered
dry
finish
good
stuff
i
have
tried
with
this
one
just
sitting
down
with
a
beer
and
with
several
different
types
of
food
and
this
beer
is
much
better
with
food
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
probably
4
years
and
i
forgot
how
refreshing
it
really
can
be
the
first
thing
that
became
apparent
is
that
the
beer
is
a
cross
between
an
ale
and
a
lager
the
rounded
fruity
ale
notes
are
complemented
by
the
clean
finish
of
the
lager
profiles
an
american
classic
that
is
perfect
for
summer
a
very
drinkable
style
its
creamy
smooth
seems
mediumbodied
and
has
a
fine
mouthfilling
carbonation
robust
and
refreshing
absolute
assertive
excellence
this
beer
didnt
seem
to
do
it
for
me
i
know
anchor
pioneered
the
style
and
name
steam
beer
which
led
me
to
believe
this
is
the
ultimate
of
the
style
if
so
then
this
style
is
not
for
me
i
was
left
unimpressed
and
dont
think
ill
try
it
again
soon
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
dissapates
slowly
and
leaves
crazy
lacing
down
the
glass
a
nice
looking
beer
to
be
sure
smell
is
dominated
by
malt
with
a
grainy
smell
backed
up
by
a
fruity
esters
aroma
not
really
complex
or
inviting
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
this
really
is
a
unique
beer
and
theres
not
really
any
other
beer
you
could
compare
it
to
the
flavor
is
bready
malt
flavor
with
a
light
caramel
sweetness
and
a
lightly
bitter
floral
hops
finish
this
beer
has
a
full
body
and
mouthfeel
even
though
its
a
lager
kind
of
and
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
makes
the
beer
more
refreshing
a
unique
american
brew
not
very
complex
but
quite
refreshing
and
a
one
of
a
kind
brew
drinkability
this
would
make
a
great
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
where
there
would
be
people
who
drink
something
besides
macros
but
may
not
be
that
knowledgable
to
open
their
perspectives
to
the
world
of
good
beer
overall
impression
a
good
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
a
little
filling
for
a
session
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
crowd
pleaser
give
it
a
try
drinkability
is
excellent
very
crisp
and
flavorful
a
nice
replacement
to
your
usual
lager
you
will
not
be
disappointed
the
end
flavour
on
your
tongue
is
quite
bitter
but
if
you
like
a
hoppy
beer
you
will
fall
in
love
like
i
did
a
usual
session
beer
for
me
when
i
have
the
money
one
day
i
would
like
to
try
this
closer
to
or
at
the
brewery
because
i
imagine
that
when
fresh
the
hops
are
that
much
more
assertive
and
the
beer
tastes
that
much
more
crisp
a
very
good
beer
poured
out
to
a
dark
orange
gold
color
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
slighly
pumpkin
colored
head
that
had
some
staying
power
odor
was
mostly
hops
with
a
hint
of
lager
like
qualities
and
a
touch
of
corn
flavor
was
solid
medium
bodied
with
a
very
nice
complexity
most
noted
taste
was
that
of
hops
and
barely
with
a
smooth
maltiness
detected
finished
slighly
sweet
and
a
touch
dry
a
helluva
good
beer
recommended
650

thin
cream

head
quickly
dissipates
medium
orange
amber
in

aroma
is
earthy
and
woodlike
hop
aromas
light
if
i
think
really
hard
i
can
almost
smell
the
slightest
hint
of
amaretto
carbonation
level
is
right
on
plenty
of
bittering
hops
in
the
flavor
but
not
much
as
far
as
flavor
goes
not
to
say
there
is
a
lack
of
flavor
only
somewhat
as
far
as
the
hops
go
nice
and
clean
and
well
balanced
with
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
left
behind
good
beer
for
hot
summer
nights
drinkability
with
so
many
beers
to
choose
from
you
forget
to
pay
occasional
homage
to
the
craft
brew
that
started
it
all
and
this
is
a
good
one
to
set
that
standard
overall
a
nice
beer
id
recommend
it
to
friends
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
from
a
macro
lager
but
nothing
that
id
put
on
my
favorites
list
i
will
certainly
buy
this
again
and
id
love
to
try
it
ontap
but
i
wont
be
pining
for
it
in
the
meantime
still
pretty
tasty
today
drinkability
i
wish
it
had
more
flavor
but
its
definately
easy
to
put
down
a
few
id
like
to
try
this
on
draught
sometime
maybe
that
will
open
it
up
some
taste
is
crisp
malt
and
nice
bittering
hops
nothing
inhgerently
hoppy
about
this
brew
that
is
just
what
comes
out
first
lightly
fruity
malt
in
the
middle
somewhere
and
way
back
there
just
hints
of
banana
crisp
mouth
and
nice
dry
finish
well
crafted
and
balanced
lots
of
subtle
complexities
an
old
favorite
that
is
always
nicely
drinkable
love
it
dark
copper
color
with
a
1
12
tan
head
good
retention
the
smell
while
it
is
cold
is
just
a
waft
of
a
little
malt
and
citrus
aroma
but
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
the
malt
aroma
sweetens
to
almost
an
candyish
degree
either
way
the
taste
is
clean
with
a
shortmedium
finish
there
is
a
mellow
caramel
apple
flavor
to
it
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
and
it
would
pair
well
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
the
mouthfeel

it

there
and
still
beautiful
smelled
of
light
malt
and
predominately
of
hops
there
was
a
nice
spice
to
the
hops
but
nothing
as
harsh
as
the
ipas
i
generally
tend
to
drink
disappeared
very
quickly
wasnt
much
of
a
session
beer
i
just
drank
it
quickly
very
quickly
i
used
to
hate
lagers
but
this
beer
is
teaching
me
not
to
be
so
judgemental
towards
the
lager

character
finish

leaves
your

watering
until
the
next
sip
its
no
secret
why
anchor
is
a
strong
player
in
the
market
they
virtually
created
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
perfect
for
a
hot

taste
is
very
smooth
some
note

going
down
very
well
nice
medium

beer
with
a
shortlived
12
head
that
stuck
to
the
glass
here
and
there
the
light
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
turned
into
a
moderately
powerful
bitterness
on
first
sip
that
was
nicely
balanced
by
the
bready
and
even
slightly
fruity
malt
flavors
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
fruitiness
became
more
pronounced
but
the
hop
bitterness
still
dominated
finished
crisp
and
clean
without
a
lingering
aftertaste
eminently
drinkable
and
a
great
beer
with
dinner
mouthfeel
is
crisp
at
the
start
with
a
crisp
slightly
dry
finish
extremely
drinkable
and
a
perfect

mostly
barley
hops
and
a
hint
of
fruit
taste
starts
off
very
empty
but
flavors
come
out
through
the
sip
ending
with
a
rather
sharp
bitterness
although
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
the
bitterness
stands
out
and
there
is
no
counterbalance
of
other
flavors
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
this
might
not
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
it
tastes
good
but
the
bitter
aftertaste
has
kept
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
dry
sweet
and
crisp
bready
malt
with
a
tickle
of
bitterness
at
the
end
very
clean
tasting
and
a
bit
spritzy
again
a
hint
of
fruit
sweetness
comes
through
but
isnt
very
present
almost
a
bit
of
mustiness
in
the
malt
i
think
its
that
earthy
flavor
maybe
the
hops
great
balance
between
bready
malt
and
hop
aftertaste
super
drinkable
pouring
a
deep
amber

an
inch

anchor

aroma
this
beer
has
a
sweetmalty
taste
and
practically
dances
on
the
tongue
anchor
steam
has
a
good
hearty
mouthfeel
without
being
too
heavy
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
i
think
would
be
an
exceptionally
good
one
to
drink
on
a
warm
afternoon
dare
i
say
a
steamy
afternoon

on

market
well
worth
the
extra
dollar
i
can
enjoy
this
brew
any
time
this
is
very
enjoyable
accomplishes
balance
of
flavors
well
like
thai
food
there
even
seems
to
be
some
saltiness
i
would
reach
for
another
the
hops
delivered
a
decent
degree
of
bitterness
but
were
rather
one
dimensional
and
didnt
mix
well
with
the
creamy
malt
this
is
a
combination
which
makes
little
sense
to
my
palate
worthy
of
a
4
imho
the
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
a
generous
frothy
white
head
that
stayed
to
at
least
a
quarter
inch
through
the
pint
the
smell
was
quite
fruity
and
malty
i
couldnt
quite
place
the
taste
but
it
was
almost
tropical
like
i
said
quite
delicious
and
refreshing
at
first
but
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pint
it
is
damn
nigh
too
much
i
will
probably
drink
more
in
the
future
but
i
definitely
couldnt
foresee
this
being
a
session
brew
even
though
it
is
under
5
abv
pouring
into
a

about

w
lots

cling

my

it
also
appears
a
little
cloudy
at
first
as
well
smell
is
of
sweetness
cherries
or
raisins
malts
maybe
however
no
hops
or
dark
malts
other
than
fruit
nothing
too
special
smooth
vanilla
cherry
flavors
up
front
with
some
hops
to
it
and
then
a
little
more
hops
on
the
finish
a
little
watery
also
and
not
too
complex
however
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
to
drink
prickly
carbonation
that
sticks
to
the
tip
of
your
tongue
on
the
sip
and
then
follows
the
contours
of
your
tongue
even
after
the
swallow
lots
of
carb
lightmedium
bodied
mild
and
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
them

nice
brew

great
brewer

dark
golden
sudsy
head
that
diminished
quickly
but
left
a
collar
all
the
way
through
smell
was
a
bit
woodsy
with
slight
fruit
aroma
taste
is
of
well
balanced
mild
hops
and
malt
bit
of
apple
notes
and
a
bit
spicy
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
a
bit
of
chewiness
but
very
mildly
so
finishes
very
smooth
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
great
session
brewi
cant
believe
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
review
this
as
i
have
had
this
many
times
now
i
really
like
anchor
steam
a
lot
drinkability
and
overall
again
anchor
has
left
me
down
first
the
osa
04
and
now
this
i
have
yet
to
try
their
bigfoot
barelywine
but
i
have
one
waiting
for
me
in
the
cellar
hopefully
its
better
than
this
bland
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
light
and
just
a
little
creamy
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
first
off
i
love
the
way
the
beer
produced
one
of
the
best
heads
of
foam
ive
ever
seen
the
color
of
the
beer
was
a
nice
dark
copper
i
liked
the
malty
smell
and
how
the
hops
are
only
really
distinctive
in
the
taste
it
also
had
a
suprisingly
somewhat
creamy
feel
other
than
that
it
would
make
a
nice
brew
for
a
warm
summer
night
i
do
like
this
beer
one
thing
i
can
say
is
that
there
is
no
beer
that
is
even
close
to
it
everyone
says
it
is
unique
and
everyone
is
right
a
great
beer
to
have
around
it
shows
what
america
is
capable
of
brewing
anchor
steam
pours
a
deep
copper
with
an
average
life
offwhite
head
its
aroma
is
fruity
meyer
lemon
and
grapefruit
with
an
essence
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
a
similarly
complex
balance
of
flavors
with
a
quick
bite
of
hops
sweet
malts
and
a
citrus
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
which
is
good
in
my
book
this
beers
drinkability
is
better
than
most
ive
tried
regardless
of
style
decent
mouthfeel
without
heavy
carbonation
has
a
little
bit
of
body
to
it
it
doesnt
feel
thin
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
when
finishing
one
it
seems
that
another
is
a
good
idea
this
beer
is
juuust
right
a
great
session
ale
that
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
rape
your
mouth
a
well
made
brew
awaits
you
from
anchor
brewing
no
skimping
here
and
not
watery
in
the
least
see
it
on
the
shelf
take
it
from
the
shelf
and
buy
it
will
not
disappoint
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
that
makes
it
all
the
more
drinkable
a
good
session
brew
ive
never
had
this
in
the
bottle
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
this
is
a
lot
different
than
what
i
remember
from
when
i
was
in
sf
for
some
reason
i
had
the
distinct
memory
of
sour
dough
bread
and
not
particularly
liking
it
but
then
again
that
was
a
few
years
ago
and
my
tastes
have
changed
since
then
the
beer
poured
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
fingerwidth
head
on
top
that
dissappeared
down
to
a
thin
film
with
a
lace
that
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
color
was
a
burnt
clear
copper
the
hops
are
not
overly
complex
and
roll
over
the
tongue
very
smoothly
however
i
did
notice
slight
hints
of
lemon
and
sugar
but
what
gets
me
is
how
much
smoother
a
beer
it
is
now
than
what
i
remember
12
ouncer
sampled
no
freshness
indication
on
the
label
pours
a
nice
rich
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
creamy
dense
head
respectable
lacing
left
behind
sweet
nose
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
medium
bodied
smooth
malty
base
to
this
one
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
on
the
tongue
smooth
subtle
hops
in
the
finish
slightly
dry
very
pleasant
quafersessoner
classic
earlyback
in
the
day
micro
thanks
for
the
memories
and
for
the
fine
suds
for
all
these
years
being
the
only
steam
beer
ive
had
this
isnt
that
bad
it
would
probably
be
better
during
the
summer
rather
than
the
winter
overall
very
clean
malty
beer
this
one
is
quite
pleasing
pours
a
dark
copper
color
could
use
a
little
more
head
despite
this
i
love
this
beer
the
hops
here
have
a
perfect
balance
to
the
malt
and
this
beer
has
a
crisp
refreshing
aftertaste
exceptionally
drinkable
like
a
pilsner
this
would
go
with
nearly
any
meal
yet
it
is
more
hearty
and
full
bodied
than
that
style
one
of
the
best
all
around
domestics
around
glad
to
see
it
at
a
cafe
for
2
50
a
bottle
usually
one
of
the
more
expensive
six
packs
at
the
local
grocery
store
after
reading
the
review
by
michael
jackson
6
months
ago
i
knew
i
needed
to
try
this
famed
steam
beer
loved
it
then
and
my
feelings
havent
changed
now
cannot
compare
to
another
steam
beer
but
the
appreance
is
above
average
nice
head
and
carbonation
but
seen
better
balanced
taste
just
perfect
would
love
to
convert
others
that
stick
to
their
coors
bud
light
and
miller
light
try
one
today
as
indicated
by
the
smell
big
and
malty
up
front
is
there
something
lemonyfruity
there
as
well
great
dry
grassy
hop
finish
that
balances
out
the
malt
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
full
and
kinda
creamy
this
beer
can
be
different
from
sip
to
sip
lately
when
i
have
one
of
these
the
flavors
all
seem
to
run
together
rather
rather
than
having
a
beginning
middle
and
end
definately
some
lemony
esters
up
front
one
of
my
few
fallbacks
poured
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
head
slightly
hazy
appearancelooks
really
good
im
impressed
with
the
taste
has
good
amount
of
hoppiness
and
it
goes
down
really
smoothno
aftertaste
i
could
see
me
havin
a
few
of
these
and
it
sucks
because
i
bought
only
one
pours
out
a
nice
copper
color
with
good
carbonation
a
a
thick
white
head
aroma
is
a
mix
of
spicy
hops
and
biscuity
malt
taste
the
definition
of
balance
a
malty
creamy
front
end
with
some
toffee
type
notes
which
gives
way
to
nice
dry
bitterness
to
finish
things
off
reminds
me
of
hsa
really
very
good
stuff
and
worth
the
8
bucks
a
sixer
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkablity
is
decent
consumed
in
october
2004
purchased
at
the
local
safeway
pours
with
a
deep
copperamber
color
i
very
nice
head
which
some
was
still
remaining
after
it
was
gone
very
little
lace
but
not
expected
either
smells
of
hops
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
a
very
unique
beer
in
my
opinion
has
that
lager
taste
but
also
has
that
ipa
taste
to
it
even
has
a
bit
of
citrus
taste
in
the
mix
it
goes
down
very
smooth
a
very
easy
beer
to
go
through
a
six
pack
and
still
want
more
possibly
my
favorite
session
beer
or
at
least
for
a
nice
hot
day
after
working
or
playing
hard
this
was
the
first
beer
i
was
introduced
to
while
growing
up
i
remember
swimming
in
eagle
lake
northern
california
and
doing
a
little
snorkling
and
finding
a
bottle
cap
from
an
anchor
steam
bottle
i
must
have
smelled
it
for
days
it
was
such
a
facsinating
smell
to
me
this
was
when
i
was
about
7
or
8
years
old
ahhhh
good
old
memories
too
bad
it
took
me
almost
20
years
from
then
to
try
my
first
it
smells
earthy
and
a
little
bit
stale
but
after
tasting
it
and
enjoying
the
bread
and
butter
mouthfeel
you
can
forgive
the
scent
it
is
perfect
for
a
cooldown
after
an
autumn
bbq
i
really
love
this
stuff
best
on
tap
at
an
old
chicago
with
a
slice
of
pepperoni
pizza
interesting
style
it
sort
of
combines
the
clarity
and
hoppiness
of
a
lager
with
the
head
and
maltiness
of
an
ale
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
big
foamy
head
which
looks
very
good
smell
was
nutty
and
hoppy
taste
was
a
sort
of
this
is
a
lager
taste
nutty
with
some
roasted
malts
and
a
nice
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
sort
of
having
multiple
personalities
tastes
bready
with
some
hints
of
lemon
and
malt
creamy
mouthfeel
after
the
initial
carbonation
kick
subsides
highly
drinkable
goes
down
very
easily
a
quality
american
classic
fine
beer
unique
certainly
to
what
i
have
had
and
better
than
i
was
expecting
try
it
if
you
have
not
yet
final
thought
not
as
good
as
i
expected
however
i
will
drink
this
on
occasion
buying
it
as
a
single
primarily
for
the
beers
unique
aspect
i
hadnt
had
this
in
quite
awhile
with
all
of
the
other
more
recent
micros
now
out
there
this
is
still
an
outstanding
beer
it
is
a
hazy
somewhat
amber
color
the
aroma
is
somewhat
floral
with
hop
notes
the
taste
is
slightly
sour
nice
blance
of
malts
and
hops
one
of
the
originals
is
still
one
of
the
best
all
in
all
this
is
fairly
good
beer
its
definately
unique
which
i
really
enjoy
and
respect
in
general
but
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
poured
as
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
lasted
awhile
my
nose
detected
a
hint
of
floral
hops
otherwise
there
was
nothing
notable
taste
was
nicely
balanced
between
a
hint
of
caramel
with
a
light
dry
hop
finish
mouthfeel
resulted
in
a
nice
clean
finish
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
but
one
that
is
unremarkable
in
my
book
and
not
worth
the
normal
high
price
tag
commanded
by
this
macro
micro
nice
caramel
type
color
with
a
creamy
head
good
hoppy
taste
but
oddly
enough
im
even
more
drawn
to
it
based
on
the
appearance
of
the
beer
itself
than
the
taste
plus
very
pretty
packaging
nice
above
average
beer
goodlooking
amber
body
with
nice
carbonation
and
finely
laced
2
inches
head
mediumlasting
piny
hops
aroma
with
notes
of
perfumey
caramel
nice
malt
development
in
mouth
good
balance
i
like
it
more
with
every
sips
it
remains
very
light
though
with
resin
hoppy
profile
bringing
a
light
bitterness
well
done
and
indeed
got
the
lager
light
and
refreshing
smooth
body
which
i
liked
for
me
this
is
an
example
of
the
sum
of
the
parts
doesnt
quite
add
up
to
the
whole
i
can
appreciate
this
beer
in
each
area
but
i
just
dont
love
it
or
even
like
it
a
lot
i
just
like
it
a
little
this
beer
pours
with
a
cloudy
brown
color
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
does
not
last
long
the
aroma
is
minimal
with
nothiong
impressive
besides
the
malty
smell
flavor
consists
of
light
roasted
malts
breadiness
and
a
touch
of
nondistinct
hops
it
also
ends
with
a
bit
of
sourness
overall
this
beer
has
nothing
too
distinct
about
it
it
beats
macro
swill
but
not
by
much
i
havent
been
drinking
craft
beer
very
long
and
i
came
back
to
this
one
after
drinking
bigger
better
beer
all
summer
long
not
expecting
much
im
shocked
to
find
that
it
tastes
even
better
than
i
remembered
this
is
a
truly
great
brew
poured
an
golden
orange
colour
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
its
clean
and
crisp
like
a
lager
and
fruity
like
an
ale
kind
of
woody
with
a
clean
malt
character
its
got
a
bitter
aftertaste
dry
finish
a
good
session
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
adequate
light
beige
colored
head
malty
earthy
and
grassy
in
the
aroma
a
slight
bit
diacetyl
and
further
minerallike
qualities
in
in
the
water
content
slightly
malty
sweet
yet
astringent
from
the
malt
and
backed
with
a
further
dulled
astringency
from
the
hops
a
bit
fruity
in
the
whole
hopmalt
balance
but
if
you
know
the
brewing
history
behind
a
steam
trademarked
or
california
common
beer
youll
understand
why
this
beer
had
pushed
the
envelope
at
one
time
when
it
came
to
smallbatch
brewing
it
since
had
become
a
u
s
classic
and
rightly
so
it
is
very
crisp
and
enjoyable
a
truly
excelent
and
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
poured
a
good
looking
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
and
left
slight
lace
till
the
end
the
smell
was
good
with
a
nice
earthy
malt
character
the
taste
was
superb
with
a
nice
citrus
bite
in
the
beginning
a
carmel
like
maltiness
as
it
washes
over
your
mouth
and
a
great
dry
citric
aftertaste
a
unique
beer
indeed
and
a
great
session
brew
as
well
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
big
tight
bubbled
head
and
just
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
biscuity
with
floral
notes
the
taste
is
very
interesting
it
starts
out
with
a
hit
of
hop
bitterness
that
quickly
leads
into
a
sweet
biscuity
almost
honeyish
feel
there
isnt
much
of
a
finish
other
than
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
a
little
watery
its
not
superlative
but
still
a
very
interesting
quaffable
beer
a
good
little
beer
not
on
par
with
the
liberty
ale
but
none
the
less
might
have
been
served
a
little
too
cold
in
the
bar
i
had
it
in
very
smooth
to
drink
classic
in
style
and
flavor
a
very
likable
and
drinkable
american
ale
beer
is
good
happy
historical
beering
the
aroma
is
kind
of
nutty
with
a
sweet
smell
in
there
the
taste
is
nutty
and
slightly
malty
but
only
a
trace
of
a
hop
prescence
mouthfeel
is
good
and
smooth
almost
too
smooth
though
overall
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
anytime
i
had
to
try
anchor
steam
since
it
is
one
of
the
few
american
classics
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
with
mediumsized
creamy
head
smell
is
clean
slightly
hoppy
with
a
note
of
sweetness
taste
is
nicely
balanced
mild
malts
and
hops
combine
for
a
fairly
complex
taste
slight
citrus
taste
is
noted
on
the
edges
of
the
sip
thankfully
anchor
steam
is
a
fullflavored
brew
that
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
for
high
drinkability
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
didnt
find
it
to
be
the
most
exciting
style
around
anchor
steam
is
a
musttry
though
its
not
often
you
find
the
originator
of
a
style
of
beer
this
anchor
is
a
very
unique
and
respectable
beer
ill
have
it
again
as
a
change
up
or
sampler
but
i
prefer
the
porterliberty
ale
amberbrown
color
with
a
creamy
head
left
some
nice
lacing
on
thw
glass
as
it
went
down
and
it
went
down
fast
very
smooth
tasting
very
wellbalanced
hops
and
malts
sweet
and
bitter
tasting
yet
is
not
rough
on
the
palate
a
truly
unique
beer
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
a
must
try
this
is
a
clean
amber
ale
with
afizzy
white
heat
that
disappears
quickly
the
beer
has
a
light
sweet
malty
aroma
the
malt
flavor
promised
in
the
aroma
gives
way
to
an
assertive
hop
bitterness
before
giving
a
crisp
clean
finish
a
tasty
drink
for
when
youre
having
more
than
one
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
one
quality
beer
a
standard
in
the
craft
beer
market
and
always
welcomed
by
me
when
i
see
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
it
might
be
a
tad
overpriced
for
a
6
pack
i
think
a
6
pack
goes
for
around
8
39
or
usually
higher
but
this
is
a
solid
product
and
a
true
session
beer
the
beer
is
clear
dark
amber
with
a
big
yellowtan
foamy
active
head
that
collapses
crustily
it
leaves
soapfilm
runny
lacing
fruit
and
crackers
in
the
nose
a
fruity
bitter
front
a
light
fruity
middle
showing
some
caramel
a
nutty
fresh
bitter
finish
a
little
tea
hoppy
aftertaste
this
is
a
nice
fresh
hoppy
light
beer
a
good
dinner
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
2
finger
thick
head
which
stuck
around
for
quite
a
while
i
recognized
immediate
sweet
malt
smells
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
nice
and
balanced
malty
even
nutty
maybe
followed
by
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
its
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
it
seems
to
be
a
little
overly
carbonated
and
maybe
that
adds
an
interesting
individual
characteristic
to
it
im
not
sure
at
times
i
felt
like
i
couldnt
find
my
way
through
the
bubbles
to
get
a
good
grip
on
some
other
lesser
tastes
though
its
still
very
drinkable
tastes
pretty
good
and
obviously
very
popular
as
a
result
much
different
and
better
on
draught
out
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
small
albeit
sharp
bite
fairly
dry
but
smooth
in
your
mouth
easy
to
swallow
the
aftertaste
lingers
but
doesnt
bother
you
and
seems
to
invite
you
to
take
another
pull
i
dont
recall
any
specific
flavors
coming
out
which
makes
me
think
it
is
benign
but
i
know
there
is
a
lot
to
it
perhaps
it
is
the
maltiness
slightly
surrounding
the
other
nuances
in
it
it
is
a
beer
worth
taking
the
time
to
savor
i
should
have
done
that
more
tonight
the
head
is
dense
and
regular
and
faded
quickly
the
body
is
of
a
red
amber
color
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
reminded
me
mostly
of
sweet
watery
caramel
almost
porto
like
a
bit
yeasty
showing
also
a
fruity
character
maybe
sweet
strawberries
also
a
chestnut
aspect
and
a
very
dry
floral
note
of
straw
interesting
the
taste
shows
caramel
but
mostly
a
sweet
winyportolike
fruitiness
oaked
and
viscuous
some
sweet
citrus
too
a
thick
and
dry
hoppiness
reveals
a
mint
and
chocolate
character
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
pronounced
but
maybe
the
accent
on
the
hops
is
a
bit
over
the
top
maybe
a
bit
too
thick
to
be
highly
drinkable
poured
out
a
nice
orangish
reddish
color
with
a
puffy
offwhite
head
head
was
chunky
in
parts
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
i
didnt
get
much
of
a
smell
from
this
beer
a
slight
flowery
scent
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
maybe
taste
was
well
balanced
a
nice
bitter
hop
bite
at
the
beginning
but
got
sweeter
as
it
warmed
up
finished
dry
and
tasty
a
nice
brew
that
is
very
smooth
drinking
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
any
time
of
the
day
clean
refreshing
and
different
jay
enjoyed
this
one
good
appearance
dark
amber
color
and
big
head
no
single
overwhelming
smell
mostly
just
clean
dry
a
little
malt
maybe
a
little
hops
taste
is
rather
nondescript
as
well
maybe
just
a
little
grain
except
for
a
strange
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
i
like
a
good
bitter
but
this
is
either
too
bitter
or
not
bitter
enough
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
for
me
however
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
so
take
that
into
consideration
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
smoothly
but
i
just
cant
say
id
want
to
buy
another
one
notes
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
doesnt
have
bold
flavors
and
its
not
high
in
alcohol
so
it
would
be
a
good
style
to
consume
a
few
of
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
beer
is
pleasant
to
drink
color
was
copper
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
quite
clean
but
some
of
the
malts
really
showed
up
in
the
aromas
they
were
a
little
bit
more
rich
than
the
bottle
verison
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
it
focused
more
on
the
earthy
tones
than
anything
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hopmalt
combination
just
like
the
bottle
verison
but
it
was
mostly
earth
tones
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
would
of
liked
to
see
some
more
flavors
in
there
ive
been
waiting
to
have
this
beer
for
a
long
time
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
that
usually
goes
along
with
high
abv
ales
but
this
one
is
under
5
so
i
cant
figure
that
out
a
little
too
malty
and
sweet
for
me
to
love
it
though
i
can
surely
taste
that
is
made
of
quality
beer
goodness
it
has
a
good
amount
of
hops
but
the
malts
over
power
them
the
color
and
appearance
are
very
pleasing
still
a
good
beer
and
one
to
add
to
your
tasting
list
when
you
can
find
it
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
firm
fluffy
head
which
later
broke
into
chunks
and
stuck
to
the
glass
nice
lacing
malty
smell
with
earthy
slightly
nutty
uniquely
woody
undertones
taste
was
very
much
like
an
amber
lager
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
consistent
with
the
beers
hybrid
nature
very
flavorful
and
complex
hops
were
firm
but
in
no
way
overbearing
nicely
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
fine
beers
this
beer
seemed
highly
drinkable
to
me
and
great
with
the
chicken
gumbo
i
was
eating
pours
out
a
light
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
it
built
a
good
head
readily
and
eventually
settled
to
about
a
14
inch
thick
still
hasnt
totally
disappeared
smells
somewhat
of
sweet
malt
and
fruity
esters
better
smell
than
most
beers
ive
reviewed
so
far
tastes
great
immediate
bitterness
balanced
by
smooth
malt
and
fruity
flavors
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
not
too
much
but
enough
to
let
you
remember
youve
had
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
also
very
good
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
light
but
still
feels
substantial
enough
for
my
dark
beer
tastes
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
can
drink
over
and
over
again
a
wonderful
offering
dn
this
a
beer
unlike
any
other
the
taste
is
familiar
but
with
something
extra
that
really
makes
this
beer
shine
i
havent
finished
a
beer
this
quickly
in
a
long
time
but
its
just
so
tasty
that
i
reviewed
it
in
about
twenty
minutes
highly
recommended
on
of
the
boldest
lager
beers
i
can
think
of
unique
and
full
of
character
i
dont
know
if
id
always
reach
for
this
first
but
i
think
it
will
always
stick
out
in
my
mind
another
winning
original
nice
rich
color
with
a
moderate
head
a
complex
taste
that
says
this
is
beer
and
good
beer
too
it
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
else
other
than
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
good
one
for
those
new
to
the
microbrew
scene
to
cut
their
teeth
on
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
the
availability
is
a
very
good
thing
if
youre
stuck
somewhere
you
cant
get
much
else
had
on
tap
at
the
cactus
in
newport
news
va
came
to
me
in
a
glass
with
a
nice
amber
color
but
not
much
head
in
sight
due
to
its
pouring
is
my
guess
a
nice
clean
aroma
with
malt
sweetness
and
notes
of
citrus
detectable
a
light
toasted
malt
flavor
is
accompanied
by
a
sweet
taste
and
a
slight
bitterness
definatly
a
lot
of
lager
charecteristics
to
this
beer
a
little
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
very
smooth
drink
it
has
a
slightly
unusal
flavor
the
is
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
and
makes
for
a
good
summer
brew
hmm
good
beer
in
the
congo
anchor
steam
poured
an
amber
colour
with
a
big
three
finger
head
after
a
few
minutes
the
head
went
away
just
leaving
a
small
amount
of
foam
lacing
coats
the
glass
like
a
curtain
very
pleasant
sweet
smell
of
maltvienna
banana
citrus
hop
and
more
malt
sweet
tasting
with
enough
of
a
bite
to
be
satisfying
little
overcarbonated
mouthfeel
but
thats
forgivable
highly
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
and
my
first
beer
of
this
style
anchor
steam
beer
was
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
clear
and
vibrant
orange
amber
and
was
topped
by
an
ample
white
head
that
left
thick
sheets
of
lacing
the
nose
was
crisp
yet
bready
sweet
with
notes
of
banana
complemented
by
a
nice
resinycitrus
hop
bouquet
the
taste
opened
with
smooth
breadycitrus
malts
followed
by
a
spicyzippy
grapefruity
bitter
transition
to
a
citrus
zesty
bananatinged
spicy
moderately
bittered
finish
the
body
was
a
little
too
thin
for
the
flavors
and
character
of
the
beer
but
otherwise
was
appropriate
anchor
steam
was
a
satisfying
and
tasty
beer
with
some
uniqueness
to
add
to
the
interest
sampled
2104
pours
a
nice
fluffly
head
that
eventually
dissipates
into
an
assertive
cloud
cover
amber
colored
smells
like
basic
beer
that
budweiser
miller
pabst
scent
starts
with
a
malty
no
roast
blank
creaminess
and
ends
with
plenty
of
hops
a
conversationenabling
beer
pleasant
enough
to
go
unnoticed
this
is
a
great
beer
its
unusual
flavor
sets
it
apart
from
other
beer
very
easy
to
drink
overall
its
great
drinkabilty
no
thanks
this
is
worth
sampling
but
the
old
bitterness
make
it
bad
in
my
book
i
will
sample
this
again
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
skunked
one
but
i
maintain
that
this
beer
has
a
low
drinkability
this
beer
is
unique
and
it
has
a
beautiful
character
i
definitely
enjoy
this
brew
a
lot
the
price
is
pretty
steep
in
my
area
though
i
will
definitely
have
to
have
a
craving
for
this
beer
in
particular
to
shell
out
the
11
for
a
six
pack
when
compared
to
many
other
brews
that
i
enjoy
as
much
i
definitely
owe
a
lot
of
respect
to
the
history
of
this
beer
for
helping
to
kick
off
the
craft
beer
movement
in
the
u
s
i
will
definitely
drink
again
pours
golden
with
a
34
light
tan
head
which
fades
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
not
much
of
an
aroma
at
all
but
what
is
there
smells
like
beer
slightly
hoppy
and
slightly
malty
it
smells
like
what
you
remember
beer
smelling
like
as
a
child
as
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
as
you
begin
the
swallow
the
bitterness
changes
to
a
malt
presence
that
is
not
sweet
the
bitterness
reappears
for
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
rather
strange
blend
it
is
not
my
favorit
beer
but
it
is
very
satisfying
in
warm
weather
and
also
when
served
with
just
about
any
meal
it
is
very
drinkable
anchor
steam
is
fully
deserving
of
its
reverence
this
is
like
no
other
beer
i
have
tried
an
excelent
brew
poured
into
a
tumbler
this
honey
amber
brew
grew
a
bubbly
white
head
the
grain
aroma
with
its
subtle
yeast
accent
was
inviting
the
rolling
malt
flavors
started
grainy
but
became
sweet
and
syrupy
only
to
lead
to
a
crisp
finish
the
hop
spicing
provides
some
interesting
counter
point
and
makes
the
brew
an
excellent
pair
with
a
bowl
of
chilli
the
mouth
feel
is
fair
at
times
a
little
too
syrupy
but
otherwise
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
will
likely
return
to
my
fridge
this
is
an
american
classic
the
somewhat
unusual
nongenre
specific
flavor
might
not
appeal
to
all
but
its
a
wellmade
enjoyable
brew
light
amber

with
a

aroma
is

brown

and
floral
with
an
enticing

taste

and
some
spiced

earthy
flavor
comes
through
strong
but
its
not
overpowering
nice
lingering
grainy
aftertaste
carbonation
a
little
high
this
brew
went
down
surprisingly
easy
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
this
is
a
step
above
their
liberty
ale
in
my
opinion
very
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
good
stuff
to
drink
i
could
drink
it
on
tap
all
day
but
from
the
bottle
it
benefits
from
a
bit
of
a
chill
this
is
a
staple
in
northern
california
and
a
beer
i
can
remember
people
drinking
around
me
since
my
early
years
pours
a
gorgeous
copperamber
color
with
an
average
fizzy
offwhite
head
and
some
solid
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
and
sweet
with
some
green
hops
tang
underneath
and
a
note
that
reminds
me
of
banana
though
this
is
not
nearly
as
bizarre
as
it
sounds
and
in
fact
imparts
yet
another
distinctive
aspect
to
an
already
unique
brew
the
taste
is
likewise
singular
i
get
a
big
maltiness
in
the
beginning
that
is
masterfully
balanced
with
a
healthy
dose
of
grassy
hops
that
keeps
the
brew
on
the
bitter
side
the
finish
is
citrusy
and
slightly
minerally
with
a
hint
of
the
same
exotic
banana
note
that
is
hinted
at
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
chewy
but
refreshing
as
well
drinkability
is
practically
unparalleled
this
is
a
must
try
and
a
true
american
icon
of
a
brew
flavor
is
satisfying
with
some
slightly
roasted
malt
and
smooth
but
crisp
sharp
hop
bitterness
and
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
average
mouthfeel
for
a
nonmacro
not
thick
good
drinkability
due
to
the
smooth
malt
and
sharp
hop
character
i
had
forgotten
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
before
i
picked
some
up
at
the
store
this
weekend
appearance
was
a
shade
of
copper
with
a
respectable
head
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
fruity
smell
to
it
along
with
a
slightly
burnt
malty
smell
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
to
very
good
this
is
by
no
means
a
heavy
beer
nor
a
light
beer
to
me
it
has
an
almost
perfect
balance
that
makes
it
not
only
tastey
but
very
drinkable
something
that
i
think
is
not
easily
achievable
in
the
brewing
world
this
is
one
of
the
breweries
and
beers
that
revitalized
the
craftbrewing
industry
in
america
and
its
still
making
a
statement
some
30
years
later
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
this
humble
reviewer
highly
recommends
it
a
very
fine
beer
i
have
converted
a
couple
people
to
good
beer
with
this
and
still
enjoy
it
myself
earns
at
least
4
out
of
5
swills
in
my
opinion
it
is
drinkable
and
true
while
anchor
is
a
flagship
of
american
brewing
this
brew
does
not
do
much
for
me
but
i
love
anchor
for
doing
it
as
it
has
provided
a
stepping
stone
into
the
craft
brewing
world
i
cut
my
teeth
on
this
beer
so
to
speak
and
still
revisit
it
from
time
to
time
the
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
clear
head
the
smell
is
nothing
spectacular
but
then
again
its
not
offensive
either
its
taste
is
initially
interesting
as
the
hops
struggle
to
let
presence
be
known
as
the
bottle
is
finished
it
leaves
you
with
just
an
average
feeling
this
beer
is
tons
better
than
bmc
but
again
it
does
not
do
much
for
me
i
must
salute
anchor
for
being
a
pioneer
though
and
this
beer
definately
has
its
place
in
my
fridge
for
the
occasional
bbq
or
for
my
as
of
yet
to
be
ba
friends
id
easily
choose
this
over
a
bud
or
miller
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
this
out
i
do
however
see
how
this
gained
popularity
back
when
an
american
microbrew
was
a
novelty
this
would
probably
be
a
great
gateway
beer
to
lure
someone
away
from
macroswill
to
quality

the
taste
of
the

the

is

it
i
want
to
like

still

o
the

beers
i
try
the
less
i
like
them
not
a
steam
beer
at
all
being
that
i
have
shared
many
anchor
steam
beers
and
brewed
a
common
homebrew
i
was
so
upset
at
how
far
this
beer
really
missed
the
mark
definitely
sessionable
but
hopefully
not
here

its

it

at

my
first
sip
turned
out
to
be
a
few
seconds
long
and
became
a
long
swig
but
as
time
went
on
it
seemed
to
lose
its
luster
and
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
it
i
had
to

the
latter

could
try
other

drinkability
easy

quaff
and
could
be
a

beer
nothing
to
right
home
about
but
this
beer
is
one
of
those
you
drink
and
dont
overanalyze
it
poured
an
orange
brown
and
was
extremely
hazy
just
a
thin
head
which
would
form
spotted
lace
around
the
glass
the
nose
was
malts
and
lemon
the
flavor
was
a
bit
disappointing
it
was
really
sweet
and
i
could
not
find
the
hops
the
malts
were
very
present
and
their
sweetness
was
mellowed
thanks
to
a
nice
woody
background
the
overall
flavor
of
this
beer
is
best
described
as
iced
tea
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
shadowy
body
at
first
is
was
pleasantly
full
but
it
finished
quite
thin
the
iced
tea
flavor
detracted
from
the
experience
and
did
not
leave
me
wanting
a
second
beer
medium
bodied
to
the
light
side
its
a
very
good
session
beer
its
not
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
hazy
copper
the
haze
is
probably
from
the
semi
excessive
use
of
hops
in
many
ways
and
the
yeast
flavours
are
at
a
minimum

so
this
cask
has
dropped
properly
nice
creamy
tiny
bubbled
sticky
lace
very
aromatic
of
fruity
esters
raw
hops
and
bready
malt
real
smooth
with
a
good
malt
foundation
fruitiness
perks
with
flavours
of
melon
pear
and
peach
big
wave
of
hops
both
in
bitterness
and
flavour
hit
the
palate
and
seems
to
linger
for
a
while
with
the
fruitiness
trailing
along
certainly
a
bold
and
expressive
cask
ale
a
solid
session
beer
its
consistency
is
of
water
with
flavour
making
it
dangerously
easy
to
drink
nice
job
on
this
cask
serving
type
bottle
nice
enough
but
not
really
a
lot
going
on
here
plain
fairly
straightlaced
malty
brew
what
is
up
with
this
brewery
looks
like
theyre
brand
new
and
i
wish
them
nothing
but
the
best
of
luck
but
this
and
their
ipa
which
are
their
only
two
beers
it
seems
appear
to
have
the
same
malt
and
hop
profile
after
all
with
slightly
different
yeast
strains
to
boot
if
i
were
to
choose
between
the
two
id
probably
go
for
this
one
im
a
sucker
for
steam
beer
but
its
fantastically
simple
and
mediocre
for
what
it
perhaps
intends
to
be
i
really
hope
their
next
offerings
to
come
through
town
are
more
unique
because
these
made
me
a
bit
sad
overall
its
fine
solid
enoughnot
really
offensive
in
any
way
it
doesnt
really
give
me
much
in
the
way
of
excitement
but
id
probably
consider
drinking
it
again
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
steam
brew
but
is
missing
i
think
some
of
the
toasty
notes
and
classic
bready
character
i
like
from
the
style
its
still
a
very
solid
enjoyable
brew
though
hope
someday
they
can
nsfw
the
nose
is
bread
malt
flowers
and
biscuits
a
little
straw
and
grain
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
cracker
bread
dough
lots
of
yeast
mixed
with
floral
hops
the
finish
is
clean
dry
this
is
good
but
nothing
amazing
standard
unoffensive
but
forgettable
on
draft
at
the
brixton
the
appearance
is
a
very
cloudy
amber
color
with
light
foam
smelling
i
find
little
to
no
aroma
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
wheatlike
something
like
a
wheatlager
hybrid
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
but
something
about
the
flavor
did
not
make
me
want
more
than
one
i
havent
had
a
anchor
steam
in
a
while
so
i
cant
compare
the
beer
is
mostly
clear
and
golden
hued
with
a
soft
white
head
malt
biscuits
and
some
mild
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
easy
drinking
and
clean
refreshing
with
a

with
zesty
carbonation

i
enjoyed
my
pint
bright
and
clear
with
a
nice

pale

a
bit
of
spice
hop
in

saaz
hops
fairly
clean

profile
with
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
and
definitely
fairly
assertive
with
the
hop
bitterness
dries
out
a
bit
in
the
finish
and
definitely
invites
another
swallow
overall
nicely
done
and
incredibly
drinkable
kicking
myself
for
not
grabbing
a
growler
of
it
when
i
visited
today
if
you
like
anchor
try
this
its
probably
not
a
fair
comparison
but
id
actually
like
to
try
them
dude
by
side
to
see
how
wrong
i
am
i
poured
one
and
a
half
cans
into
a
half
liter
steina
deep
bronze
with
a
quick
to
fade
white
head
aromas
are
light
with
some
caramel
and
dough
mainlysome
light
soapiness
is
there
as
well
that
soaplike
note
is
bigger
on
the
palate
along
with
some
caramel
and
mild
toastsome
light
earthiness
as
well
in
the
finish
the
soapiness
kind
of
takes
over
the
beer
at
first
wich
is
a
turn
offafter
awhile
it
gets
better
but
still
a
little
annoying
more
than
enough
to
hold
your
interest
this
is
a
much
more
nuanced
version
than
the
earlier
ones
available
the
colour
is
darker
than
anchor
steam
and
the
flavour
bigger
and
more
complex
the
yeast
issue
seems
to
be
resolved
and
the
beer
has
that
perfect
combination
of
ale
and
lager
that
makes
for
great
drinakbility
a
sessionable
beer
that
arrived
just
in
time
for
the
heart
of
summer
o
enjoyed
the
malts
but
the
yeast
left
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
hopefully
this
was
because
of
the
first
run
but
this
beer
did
not
have
nearly
as
pleasant
of
a
yeast
profile
as
anchor
steam
had
on
tap
beautiful
amber
by
the
way
the
brewer
and
owner
are
very
hospitable
its
very
good
beer
this
beer
is
a
decent
maltforward
lager
malt
and
grain
flavors
predominant
nothing
exceptional
but
another
easy
drinking
thirst
quencher
beer
is
medium
in
body
creamy
and
has
a
nice
finish
on
it
mildly
bitter
not
grainy
at
all
a
fine
steam
beer
lager
the
munich
malt
comes
through
nicely
and
the
finish
is
good
id
have
it
again
probably
overall
i
had
this
a
while
back
but
definitely
enjoyed
it
i
think
i
have
to
try
this
again
to
get
a
more
accurate
idea
overall
a
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
beer
i
recommend
this
one
very
highly
o
not
a
bad
beer
could
have
had
a
smoother
aftertaste
and
more
fruit
notes
visions
of
blazing
sixguns
taking
down
rows
of
empty
bottles
perfect
clarity
off
of
the
coppercolored
brew
and
the
decent
sized
head
leaves
some
patchy
lacing
clean
malt
nose
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
bread
very
very
smooth
with
a
moderate
sized
body
the
palate
is
clean
throughout
with
a
dryish
malt
character
aside
from
a
quick
splash
of
caramel
modest
hop
ping
goes
right
to
balancing
and
retains
a
subtle
herbal
flavor
hints
of
fruit
and
nutty
bready
malt
in
the
dry
finish
a
very
tasty
straightup
lager
herenothing
fancy
just
really
good
drinking
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
would
pursue
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
holds
up
well
with
other
steam
beers
d
even
though
this
beer
has
a
dark
body
the
taste
and
aroma
are
very
light
and
thin
not
that
much
depth
and
the
sulfury
flavor
covers
most
of
the
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
d
i
would
definitely
get
this
beer
again
probably
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
in
a
little
while
but
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
the
taste
is
that
of
molasses
and
malt
with
just
a
wee
bit
of
hop
bittering
i
cant
say
that
i
notice
any
hop
aroma
or
flavor
i
would
definately
drink
another
and
do
indeed
have
one

this
one

somehow

im
not

this
is
supposed
to
be
amber
according
to
the
label
but
its
a
bit
on
the
lemony
and
sour
side
too
confusing
its
more
or
less
like
a
lipton
iced
tea
with
added

flavors
this
has
a
real
grainy

with
some
caramel

faint
citrus

it

a
light
chestnut
tinted
amber
under
a
1
offwhite
foam
cap
that
produces
significant
lace
offers
a
very
creamy
palate
beginning
with
very
faint
chocolate
grain
and
light
caramel
with
very
nicely
balanced
malt
sugar
flavors
it
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
growing
to
a
mild
caramel
biscuit
flavor
that
dries
out
on
the
finish
the
hops
have
a
mild
citrus
mint
flavor
with
a
light
bitter
touch
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
the
malt
flavors
linger
nicely
medium
body
and
a
little
above
on
the
carbonation
this
would
be
alright
on
tap
with
a
cheap
burger
but
for
something
coming
out
of
a
bomber
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
ill
probably
order
it
again
someday
if
i
see
it
in
a
local
grill
or
tavern
but
ill
stick
with
something
bolder
for
my
fridge
amber
beer
with
a
lemon
scent
and
taste
very
slight
mint
taste
medium
carbonation
the
flavor
is
good
with
a
gentle
malt
flavor
which
has
a
light
toasted
flavor
which
accents
the
piney
herbal
flavors
from
the
hops
well
with
a
mild
caramel
element
that
balances
some
of
the
bitterness
and
yeast
is
dry
without
much
fruitiness
overall
just
compliments
the
hop
and
malt
overall
a
very
quaffable
balanced
beer
in
the
steam
style
it
kind
of
strikes
me
as
a
hoppy
alt
or
german
ipa
if
you
will
a
little
more
bitter
than
most
but
still
very
drinkable
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
solid
balance
through
the
flavoring
the
malts
showed
nice
depth
even
sweetness
and
just
the
right
about
of
hearty
metallic
bite
this
last
component
is
where
a
lot
of
beers
in
the
style
tend
to
go
overboard
but
the
result
here
was
pure
crispness
and
cleanliness
thus
this
beer
stays
true
to
style
and
keeps
things
fresh
and
inviting
from
start
to
finish
the
taste
is
more
balanced
than
the
smell
meaning
a
bit
more
hop
bite
on
the
malt
side
is
a
touch
of
fruitiness
that
i
didnt
detect
in
t
he
smell
blackberry
the
hop
is
nondescript
but
provides
some
bitterness
particularly
in
the
aftertaste
the
earthiness
remains
the
predominant
impression
the
body
and
carbonation
are
predictably
average
in
each
case
oits
a
milder
steam
beer
its
drinkable
without
much
to
complain
about
definitely
more
mellow
than
say
an
anchor
steam
more
or
less
tastes
like
a
mild
red
ale
really
not
really
spectacular
personally
i
always
enjoy
a
anchor
steam
and
if
can
throw
a
bone
to
my
local
brewery
thats
cool
too
overall
i
really
dug
it
havent
had
to
many
of
this
style
my
friend
had
a
sip
of
mine
and
he
said
it
was
def
better
that
anchor
steam
i
like
anchor
steam
but
i
think
im
going
to
agree
with
him
poured
a
clear
amber
with
thin
eggshell
colored

good

left
nice

wisps
smells
of
fruit
floral
hops
grainy
malt
and
citrus
tastes
of
grains
honey
light
bread
pineapple
lemon
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
medium
light
in
body
good
carbonation
smooth
and
lightly
malty
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
a
good
california
common
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
quite
sessionable
but
with
so
much
other
stuff
on
tap
at
victory
its
hard
to
want
to
stick
with
this
one
in
the
end
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
was
an
excellent
representation
of
the
california
commonsteam
beer
style
if
its
ontap
anywhere
in
your
area
then
i
suggest
you
give
this
victory
beer
a
try
drinkability
the
is
a
killer
session
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
day
long
and
not
get
bored
with
it
too
bad
this
is
a
oneoff
beer
victory
always
puts
out
nice
product
dont
drink
and
review
hv
d
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
steam
beer
on
the
menu
at
victory
their
take
on
the
california
common
is
solid
with
lots
of
flavors
gelling
together
and
producing
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
highly
drinkable
final
thoughts
akin
to
other
ipls
that
have
come
out
in
the
past
year
or
so
would
be
better
if
it
werent
for
the
offflavor
in
the
aftertaste
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
on
tap
but
i
will
be
checking
out
the
rest
of
their
offerings
thanks
daftpatrick
for
the
opportunity
if
their
pils
is
my
favorite
offering
of
bauhau
this
is
a
very
close
second
an
interesting
take
on
a
california
common
an
enjoyable
and
tasty
take
i
might
add
the
hops
are
evident
but
there
is
also
a
nice
biscuity
nutty
malt
flavor
hops
are
flavorful
not
bitter
notes
of
peaches
and
apricots
on
the
taste
aroma
gives
off
some
light
citrus
as
well
highly
drinkable
full
of
flavor
a
definite
winner
here
overall
tried
a
can
from
this
new
brewery
in
minneapolis
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
nice
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
probably
a
pretty
good
option
for
session
drinking
or
to
introduce
craft
beer
to
bmc
folks
overall
a
very
solid
brew
that
is
described
as
a
california
common
but
comes
off
like
a
citrus
forward
american
pale
ale
really
good
use
of
hops
oliked
this
twist
on
a
ca
common
with
its
west
coast
hop
influence
a
very
good
lager
hazy
goldorange
with
a
small
sweetness
on
the
nose
hop
bitterness
and
a
sort
is
grapefruit
pith
tang
with
no
real
malt
sweetness
on
the
tongue
you
could
be
drinking
bud
i
guess
resiny
aftertaste
with
a
mineral
touch
and
a
faint
hint
of
bitterness
aftertaste
is
just
a
slight
beery
mouthful
utterly
forgettable
not
really
much
to
recommend
this
but
its
a
pleasant
gulp
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
im
finding
i
quite
like
it
its
a
very
traditional
take
on
the
style
but
i
find
it
wellmade
and
quite
refreshing
taste
toasted
grain
peppercorns
mild
caramel
apple
skin
tobacco
grassy
sweet
clean
mild
fruitiness
grapenuts
filberts
warming
drying
finish
breath
of
alcohol
is
it
steamy
in
here
or
is
it
just
this
beer
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copperbronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
dried
malt
mild
flowers
milder
pine
and
a
touch
of
candied
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
with
a
heavy
overarching
dose
of
conflicting
maple
syrup
and
pine
resin
this
coupling
clashes
constantly
drowning
out
the
otherwise
mild
and
genial
characters
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
and
crisp
finish
overall
this
is
a
bit
too
messy
of
a
beer
to
do
much
good
anywhere
it
could
be
worse
though
so
i
guess
theres
that
i
think
that
this
experiment
proves
that
not
all
beer
styles
are
better
doubled
or
imperialed
while
this
is
a
fine
drinking
beer
it
lacks
the
crisp
refreshing
qualities
one
typically
seeks
late
on
a
long
hot
summer
day
o
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
was
my
first
california
common
which
i
understand
is
a
lager
that
is
fermented
at
higher
temperatures
would
i
buy
this
again
probably
not
for
myself
although
the
wife
liked
this
one
a
lot
so
i
guess
it
depends
who
you
are
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
that
was
more
complex
than
i
expected
from
a
california
commonsteam
beer
and
i
think
that
the
abv
showing
through
separated
this
from
the
pack
in
this
style
so
i
definitely
want
to
have
this
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
but
with
heavy
carbonation
takes
the
heaviness
of
a
double
beer
with
the
crispness
of
a
pilsner
of
lager
and
works
it
well
i
enjoyed
this
and
am
mad
i
did
not
get
more
then
a
single
when
it
was
around
if
it
was
round
next
year
i
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
the
taste
is
pretty
decent
with
some
malty
flavors
which
are
toasted
and
slightly
caramel
with
some
very
nice
hop
flavors
which
are
both
woody
and
slightly
spiced
with
some
mild
yeast
flavors
which
seem
to
clash
ever
so
slightly
making
the
malt
come
forward
along
with
a
mild
alcohol
infused
finish
this
is
an
odd
beer
i
like
the
concept
but
it
doesnt
quite
deliver
a
double
california
common
it
does
provide
the
double
strength
which
is
probably
why
it
doesnt
get
a
better
score
since
the
alcohol
kind
of
holds
it
back
from
being
more
enjoyable
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
body
with
a
bitter
grassy
hop
presence
up
front
thats
countered
by
a
very
sweet
malt
backbone
and
an
unpleasant
metallic
adjunct
like
character
that
lingers
long
into
the
finish
this
sweet
adjunct
flavor
was
evident
in
the
nose
but
is
much
stronger
here
and
really
hurts
the
flavor
of
the
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
just
in
my
head
but
there
is
a
sweet
corn
or
rice
flavor
that
is
really
sweet
overtaking
over
the
hops
and
interesting
malt
notes
theres
a
touch
of
boozy
heat
in
the
finish
but
the
high
abv
is
nicely
masked
not
harsh
per
se
but
the
hop
flavors
are
muted
and
the
off
flavors
make
it
tough
to
finish
a
small
serving
this
is
a
classic
better
than
a
sum
of
its
parts
beer
after
reading
a
lot
of
reviews
talking
about
how
sweet
this
beer
was
i
was
expecting
not
to
like
it
too
much
but
honestly
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
sweetness
others
referred
to
it
was
nicely
balanced
had
a
nice
hop
finish
to
clamp
down
on
the
solid
malty
backbone
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
bit
thin
not
to
the
point
of
being
watery
but
a
little
less
robust
than
i
would
have
liked
i
wont
put
this
on
a
favorites
list
but
its
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
steam
beers
and
ive
certainly
never
had
an
imperial
version
but
i
thought
this
beer
did
a
good
job
at
sticking
to
the
basic
steam
beer
formula
but
making
each
aspect
bolder
then
it
normally
is
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
but
it
was
a
little
filling
and
the
i
think
i
would
get
bored
of
the
taste
eventually
so
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
and
i
think
the
sweetness
also
hurts
the
drinkability
a
little
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
and
the
appearance
i
thought
both
of
those
aspects
were
pretty
good
what
i
liked
the
least
was
the
sweetness
and
thickness
i
thought
they
could
be
both
be
toned
down
a
little
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
really
not
the
type
of
beerddd
that
i
would
normally
buy
but
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
good
strong
version
of
a
steam
beer
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
let
down
with
this
beer
even
though
it
was
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
i
thought
it
was
solid
for
what
it
was
going
for
and
i
thought
it
was
also
a
pretty
good
deal
for
an
8
beer
solid
works
guys
ill
keep
a
look
out
for
more
beers
from
this
series
12

pours

thick
and
frothy

malty
aroma
breadya
lot
of
cereal
cream
o
wheatherbal
and
a
touch
of
fruit
as
expected
from
style
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
sweeter
and
with
a
good
touch
of
warming
alcohol
but
not
over
the
top
mouthfeel
is
good
and
substantial
smooth
nice
really
dont
know
how
to
judge
this
beer
but
i
like
it
but
maybe
one
bottle
would
be
enough
serving
type
bottle
o
this
is
pretty
good
version
of
a
california
common
of
course
i
compare
it
to
anchor
steam
which
prefer
but
this
has
a
surprising
level
of
tartness
that
i
found
interesting
and
not
to
dominate
and
refreshing
i
picked
up
a
6pack
of
this
for
5
bucks
at
my
local
bottle
shop
how
could
i
not
pick
it
up
ov
an
interesting
beer
ive
never
had
the
style
before
so
had
no
preconceived
notions
about
what
to
expect
here
the
flavour
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
very
nice
an
interesting
mix
of
flavours
that
work
pretty
well
together
and
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
good
effort
from
st
overall
havent
had
a
steam
beer
in
years
since
anchor
steam
back
in
the
day
interesting
brew
and
kudos
to
st
for
going
for
something
different
good
not
great
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
particularly
special
and
for
the
style
i
found
the
alcohol
a
bit
more
prominent
then
i
would
like
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
i
guess
its
quite
boring
and
has
the
taste
of
a
session
beer
with
enough
booze
to
slow
you
down
another
beer
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
pick
up
again
omaybe
it
is
the
style
but
this
beer
did
nothing
for
me
on
a
summer
say
it
is
refreshing
but
not
very
flavorful
just
a
tad
too
heavy
to
be
golf
course
beer
and
i
made
that
mistake
thats
on
me
however
this
is
a
nice
fall
brew
being
a
real
malt
forward
offering
and
something
highly
rare
as
far
as
i
know
an
imperial
steam
style
smelling
like
german
and
english
malts
caramel
and
toffee
abound
but
its
not
that
sweet
liquid
bread
comes
to
mind
if
it
werent
for
the
ale
yeast
which
is
bright
and
punctual
dabbing
in
and
out
with
a
lightness
that
seems
to
temper
an
otherwise
heavy
grain
forward
brew
almost
lager
clean
in
the
finish
something
to
behold
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
could
use
a
touch
more
vigorous
carbonation
but
the
big
body
is
right
on
not
my
favorite
of
the
2x
beers
but
i
absolutely
caught
this
one
out
of
context
full
autumnal
i
am
wring
to
critique
this
fun
beer
too
hard
great
buzz
for
the
price
too
a
sixer
is
a
chore
overall
a
style
you
dont
see
too
many
breweries
try
but
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
good
i
was
really
surprised
and
blown
away
by
this
beer
for
one
steam
beers
are
anything
but
common
and
to
find
an
imperialized
version
of
one
is
pretty
much
unheard
of
in
fact
this
is
probably
my
first
one
on
to
the
beer
rich
copper
color
lively
carbonation
and
a
healthy
white
foam
head
that
lingers
smell
is
clean
with
notes
of
herbal
northern
brewer
hops
and
light
pale
malt
notes
taste
really
wows
as
its
not
heavy
or
sweet
like
i
was
expecting
very
drinkable
fullflavored
good
clean
flavor
from
the
lager
yeast
neutral
malt
character
just
a
touch
of
toasty
flavor
and
a
really
nice
snappy
hop
finish
that
finish
is
clean
and
biting
and
i
just
love
whatever
hops
they
used
to
do
this
the
strength
of
the
beer
is
undetectable
until
you
finish
then
you
feel
that
this
one
packs
a
little
more
booze
than
normal
i
was
left
really
wishing
i
had
gotten
a
sixpack
instead
of
just
a
single
definitely
recommended
particularly
if
you
like
steam
beers
copper
penny
color
thin
layer
of
foam
on
top
light
malt
and
that
familiar
california
common
yeast
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
very
malty
profile
with
the
familiar
yeast
flavoring
i
get
some
hop
interplay
in
the
back
of
the
palate
never
had
an
imperialized
california
common
it
is
pretty
good
but
not
amazing
o
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
just
not
quite
enough
to
back
up
the
abv
i
think
interesting
attempt
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
another
imperial
steam
beer
after
this
one
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
on
4302013
pours
lightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
12
finger
dense
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
apple
pear
toast
biscuit
floral
grass
light
pepper
and
yeast
earthiness
nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
good
balance
of
malt
hop
and
yeast
notes
with
solid
strength
taste
of
caramel
toast
pear
apple
biscuit
floral
grass
light
pine
light
pepper
and
yeast
earthiness
light
earthy
spiciness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
caramel
toast
biscuit
apple
pear
floral
grass
light
pine
light
pepper
and
yeast
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
hop
and
yeast
flavors
with
good
flavor
robustness
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
imperial
steam
beer
good
balance
of
malt
yeast
and
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
would
honestly
take
bmc
over
this
i
usually
like
southern
tiers
products
but
this
is
a
failure
pass
on
this
beer
overall
this
is
very
nice
beer
the
bread
dough
emphasis
an
excellent
choice
and
the
sugars
and
hops
providing
good
overall
balance
eminently
drinkable
onot
a
bad
beer
drinkability
is
good
but
alcohol
i
think
hinders
the
flavor
probably
wont
get
it
again
but
worth
trying
once
this
is
a
rather
simplistic
offering
from
st
its
brewed
to
style
and
has
decent
drinkability
given
its
size
its
a
bit
dry
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
there
is
enough
depth
to
enjoy
as
a
beer
this
is
a
bit
forgettable
but
for
the
style
its
on
point
o
even
though
the
alcohol
is
a
little
on
the
higher
side
for
the
style
intentionally
of
course
this
is
a
solid
steam
beer
easy
to
drink
for
a
spring
brew
where
things
are
starting
to
get
a
little
warmer
but
its
still
on
the
colder
side
a
welcome
addition
to
the
lineup
overall
its
a
hybrid
of
the
california
common
style
the
abv
nearly
double
the
ca
common
style
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
hop
bitternessflavor
very
full
and
alcoholic
to
be
a
session
beer
but
with
all
that
said
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
purchase
again
overall
sorta
like
a
thicker
and
creamier
malt
liquor
with
a
bit
more
hop
than
normal
like
a
high
end
malt
liquor
not
too
bad
if
that
is
what
you
are
in
the
mood
for
actually
a
good
beer
but
its
just
a
bit
much
the
melanoidin
character
is
quite
strong
and
needs
dialed
back
to
improve
its
drinkability
perhaps
replaced
with
munich
if
indeed
that
is
what
they
are
using
one
of
these
is
plenty
o
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
im
a
fan
of
most
of
the
southern
tier
beers
ive
tried
so
i
figured
it
was
a
must
i
tried
this
beer
when
i
saw
it
i
wouldnt
buy
an
entire
6
again
but
could
see
myself
having
one
or
two
as
a
session
beer
on
the
beach
pretty
god
beer
poured
cold
with
smallish
creamcolored
head
that
soon
settled
and
almost
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
deep
orangecopperamber
with
plenty
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
hop
malt
oak
spice
flavors
like
nose
plus
caramel
and
is
rich
body
is
full
not
too
counter
to
its
heavy
bitterness
and
has
great
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
with
bitter
hanging
in
there
to
the
end
12oz
bottle
from

long
hop
finish
a
refreshing
brew
starting
with

anf

like
an
ipa
nice
brew
creative
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
is
followed
by
a
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
im
enjoying
this
one
it
has
a
great
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
and
is
pretty
drinkable
for
an
8
abv
beer
as
the
beer
warms
in
the
glass
the
hops
do
become
more
pronounced
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
mellow
and
a
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
that
fades
into
a
dryer
hairspray
like
alcohol
presence
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malt
and
small
hairspray
like
aftertaste
eh
i
suppose
its
ok
just
a
bit
boozy
overall
making
a
double
version
of
a
steam
beer
is
certainly
an
interesting
experiment
but
ultimately
one
that
in
my
opinion
does
not
have
to
be
repeated
o
i
think
the
suped
up
version
of
a
california
commonsteam
higher
abv
is
an
interesting
idea
but
needs
to
have
the
booze
a
little
more
well
hidden
from
the
taste
to
be
really
enjoyable
for
me
overall
this
wasnt
bad
but
i
had
certainly
expected
better
this
is
a
unique
style
and
i
applaud
southern
tier
for
trying
this
but
it
definitely
isnt
something
i
feel
the
need
to
buy
again
o
while
this
beer
is
somewhat
uneven
in
spots
its
still
an
appealing
beer
drinkable
on
to
the
beer
though
high
grain
presence
it
seems
quite
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
as
well
almost
seems
boozy
from
a
whole
whopping
8
its
carrying
decent
enough
to
drink
just
nowhere
near
as
inspiring
or
interesting
as
other
brews
southern
tier
has
done
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
golden
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
minimal
and
the
retention
is
thin
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
big
amount
of
toasted
malt
on
the
nose
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
the
taste
has
the
same
toasted
flavor
as
what
the
nose
was
kind
of
giving
a
preview
too
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
subtle
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
pretty
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
decent
nothing
too
crazy
but
was
nice
to
try
o
this
is
a
very
memorable
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
so
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
clean
beer
the
only
downfall
could
be
that
it
has
too
much
going
on
but
there
seems
to
be
enough
separation
in
the
flavors
from
keeping
it
too
muddled
i
think
that
fans
of
sweeter
styles
of
beer
such
as
bocks
will
really
enjoy
this
one
it
has
enough
bitterness
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
at
the
end
which
really
helps
out
with
drinkability
while
looking
smelling
and
tasting
the
beer
it
is
clear
that
effort
was
put
into
making
a
good
quality
beer
poured
one
and
a
half
bottles
into
a
12
liter
stein
wich
brought
good
clarity
to
a
copperbronze
body
and
a
nicely
defined
one
finger
creamylike
head
atop
very
clean
nose
with
only
mild
toastiness
and
caramel
sweetness
a
full
almost
creamy
feel
to
the
beer
is
by
far
the
best
part
of
it
flavors
have
subdued
caramel
and
doughy
sweetness
up
front
more
mild
sweetness
coming
from
the
alcohol
and
a
honey
tingehops
are
subdued
just
giving
a
faint
flash
of
leafinessi
even
detect
a
sour
note
although
very
light
in
the
finish
iam
not
sure
about
a
double
steam
style
but
i
iam
a
big
fan
of
st
going
back
to
my
western
ny
days
overall
an
easy
to
quaff
beer
i
think
this
represents
the
style
well
despite
the
higher
alcohol
content
overall
i
like
it
considering
the
fact
it
is
a
bigger
version
of
the
style
it
does
have
that
woodsy
feel
to
it
but
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
in
the
taste
which
makes
it
less
drinkable
all
in
all
its
pretty
good
wouldnt
seek
out
but
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
bad
brew
definitely
something
different
for
me
but
not
anything
new
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
grab
a
glass
and
enjoy
salud
interesting
beer
drinkability
is
not
that
high
though
overall
letting
it
ride
as
a
somewhat
bigger
somewhat
bolder
beer
it
was
fine
a
rough
one
im
finishing
it
because
its
engrained
in
me
that
i
have
to
drink
something
else
or
like
me
learn
the
hard
way
not
bad
but
southern
tier
has
better
beers
out
there
their
2x
ipa
and
2x
stout
are
much
better
than
this
not
to
say
this
beer
is
terrible
but
i
was
expecting
greatness
i
guess
i
got
my
hopes
up
too
high
this
beer
just
lacks
flavor
to
be
quite
honest
it
mostly
tastes
of
sweetness
with
a
trace
of
hops
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
to
form
your
own
opinion
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
fun
to
try
a
little
too
thick
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
probably
a
better
springtime
beer
not
going
to
get
again
but
glad
i
picked
up
a
6
to
give
a
chance
to
a
very
good
and
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
a
really
enjoyable
mouthfeel
and
great
flavor
hides
its
strength
well
easy
to
like
definitely
will
have
this
again
o
a
hop
focused
beer
with
a
fair
amount
of
yeast
character
a
cool
idea
for
a
style
that
has
been
well
executed
great
drinkability
nothing
life
changing
but
goes
down
easy
i
love
a
good
steam
beer
but
was
concerned
on
how
one
would
come
out
doubled
it
actually
is
a
little
light
colorwise
for
a
steam
beer
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
the
taste
again
ive
never
had
a
double
steam
beer
for
better
or
for
worse
they
nailed
this
it
does
taste
like
a
doubled
version
of
anchors
steam
however
like
the
majority
of
double
pilsners
it
just
comes
off
too
sweet
and
boozy
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
lager
to
drink
for
a
while
if
you
want
something
a
bit
different
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
copper
hue
perfect
clarity
a
vigorous
pour
produced
2
fingers
of
loose
foam
that
fell
amicably
to
a
thin
ring
and
skin
on
top
excellent
lacing
no
real
carbonation
to
be
seen
coming
up
from
the
bottom
nose
is
lager
yeast
with
a
faint
touch
of
sweet
lemon
herbal
hops
light
grass
sweet
malt
corn
and
honey
theres
even
a
little
mint
a
touch
of
tobacco
and
some
light
toast
taste
is
sweet
but
not
heavy
without
much
carbonation
its
very
soft
on
the
palate
hops
are
bitter
but
a
little
shy
herbal
minty
grainy
nutty
and
a
little
warmth
from
the
alcohol
theres
a
nice
oily
coating
but
no
bitter
bite
that
usually
goes
with
that
the
malt
is
sweet
and
full
and
there
is
just
a
touch
of
pine
on
the
back
palate
body
is
thin
and
it
drinks
creamy
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
finishes
dry
and
crisp
this
a
very
supple
beer
thats
vivid
and
unique
the
rest
while
it
may
not
be
apparent
from
my
review
this
is
a
really
good
beer
big
bold
flavors
not
much
hint
of
the
alcohol
hiding
in
there
and
great
drinkabilty
a
buddy
brought
over
a
sixpack
for
a
barbq
and
we
quite
enjoyed
these
overall
i
tried
rating
this
to
style
as
it
is
better
than
several
beers
i
have
had
of
this
style
that
said
of
the
2x
series
it
is
probably
my
least
favorite
it
meets
the
style
but
the
extra
alcohol
really
does
not
do
much
for
me
flavor
wise
the
rest
is
just
an
ok
beer
i
will
pass
in
the
future
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
thinnish
white
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
honey
like
malts
orange
marmalade
and
dark
pitted
fruits
light
bready
pilsner
malt
shines
through
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
a
bit
woody
with
a
firm
earthy
hop
bitterness
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
presence
in
the
flavor
that
i
didnt
find
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
thought
from
the
aroma
medium
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
i
usually
enjoy
southern
tier
but
this
one
is
not
for
me
boring
too
sweet
with
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
presence
i
like
the
2x
series
especially
the
stout
and
ipa
never
had
the
2xmas
ale
these
beers
are
higher
in
the
alcohol
department
but
served
in
a
more
manageable
size
unlike
their
other
high
octane
brews
pours
a

drinks
down

it
doesnt

in

its
just

about

even
carbonation

not

just

overall
a
beer
that
will
get
your
non
craft
beer
drinkers
wasted
even
though
this
beer
is
flavored
toward
a
newbie
into
craft
beer
with
somewhat
of
a
lack
of
complexity
they
did
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
stayed
true
to
the
originators
of
the
style

a
clear
dark

of

this
is
a
good
beer
a
sneak
attack
for
its
mild
character
but
its
potent
results
big
malt
flavor
up
front
with
thick
bread
notes
and
some
sweet
caramel
flavor
the
taste
is
kept
lively
with
good
carbonation
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
floral
and
herb
a
very
tasty
beer
reminds
me
of
an
octoberfest
without
the
roasted
malt
flavor
o
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
i
decided
to
pick
one
up
not
sure
if
i
would
ask
for
another
one
however
i
havent
had
too
many
steam
beers
but
in
my
novice
opinion
id
rather
stick
to
another
one
of
the
st
ales
o
not
one
of
the
better
offerings
at
southern
tier
who
makes
some
really
great
beers
overall
i
see
the
label
that
2
types
of
hops
were
used
maybe
they
should
have
used
another
usually
st
hits
the
ballpark
with
these
2x
beers
being
balanced
and
hoppy
but
this
one
is
metallic
stingy
and
somewhat
terrible
price
point
1
4912
oz
single
id
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
but
it
doesnt
amaze
me
o
not
bad
this
is
a
different
take
on
a
steam
but
its
the
abundance
of
malt
that
makes
this
one
not
superb
but
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
also
the
8
is
masked
well
in
taste
so
its
quite
drinkable
for
its
weight
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
to
me
i
really
havent
had
that
many
like
it
one
thing
i
dont
like
is
the
residual
sweetness
more
than
most
beers
for
my
palate
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
only
seem
to
augment
with
warmth
and
each
sip
bringing
the
beer
more
and
more
out
of
balance
a
ton
of
interesting
flavors
but
it
just
doesnt
form
a
great
end
product
due
to
alcohol
and
sweetness
i
know
this
is
a
relatively
simple
style
with
hops
being
a
major
player
but
this
imperial
version
takes
simplicity
and
mauls
it
perhaps
this
could
be
classified
as
a
classy
malt
liquor
but
this
is
not
a
great
beer
any
newbies
to
the
style
stick
with
anchor
steam
the
og
overall
i
am
not
especially
impressed
the
flavor
profile
is
perfectly
executed
for
the
stlye
but
i
really
dont
care
for
the
abundant
sweetness
ill
just
stick
to
the
regular
steam
beer
a
little
hop
bitterness
makes
this
an
enjoyable
steam
beer
very
easy
drinking
at

o
i
actually
like
this
beer
find
it
balanced
and
fairly
refreshing
i
wish
it
was
1x
should
i
blend
this
with
water
what
the
heck
is
wrong
with
1x
this
was
not
a
good
beer
for
me
i
had
about
14
of
the
glass
then
drain
poured
it
overall
a
solid
new
beer
wont
blow
you
away
with
flavor
but
is
instead
a
balanced
albeit
malt
forward
brew
works
for
coming
out
of
winter
and
into
summer
i
want
to
read
english
old
ale
and
dopplebock
into
the
flavor
profile
here
but
neither
of
those
are
apt
here
but
the
familiar
and
comfortable
flavors
remind
me
of
rogues
dead
guy
ale
and
double
dead
guy
toasted
bread
notes
up
front
herbal
hop
bitterness
picks
up
right
away
honey
wheat
bread
malt
fills
in
light
sweetness
toasted
edge
to
everything
and
hints
of
cooked
carrots
woody
herbal
bitterness
carries
to
the
finish
lingering
honeyish
malt
medium
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
feel
slightly
warming
not
bad
but
feels
like
the
amped
up
ingredients
dont
work
as
well
together
at
these
levels
this
is
a
meat
potatoes
kind
of
beer
it
even
has
an
irish
vibe
to
it
i
definitely
appreciate
going
outside
the
box
in
the
california
common
steam
beer
category
pours
a
nice
honey
golden
color
with
a
quick
burst
of
foam
that
goes
away
fairly
quickly
not
overly
carbonated
and
it
smells
a
bit
like
banana
and
graham
cracker
tastes
like
an
oktoberfest
on
steroids
has
a
malty
taste
that
is
crisp
and
clean
that
yields
to
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
which
doesnt
linger
too
long
while
a
fan
of
southern
tier
not
a
fan
of
their
2x
everything
and
anything
trend
an
imperial
steam
beer
is
not
something
craft
beer
needed
all
the
subtle
balance
of
anchor
steam
is
lost
here
there
is
nothing
really
wrong
here
but
not
much
right
either
pass
on
this
one
boozy
but
not
too
harsh
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
not
sure
what
season
theyre
aiming
for
with
this
one
but
its
far
too
heavy
for
a
summer
brew
sweetness
is
almost
cloying
and
hop
flavor
is
somewhat
one
note
the
bitterness
has
an
odd
almost
stale
soapy
feel
to
it
perfect
except
that
it
is
too
good
palate
is
much
the
same
with
a
moderate
body
and
low
carbonation
low
lying
earthy
bitterness
balances
the
malt
pretty
nicely
almost
like
a
whole
grain
raisin
swirl
bread
without
any
cinnamon
or
much
sweetness
earthy
bitter
grain
with
earthy
bitter
hops
and
overall
clean
flavor
profile
not
very
refreshing
for
the
season
but
it
is
a
pretty
goo
beer
and
does
place
your
mind
in
some
wild
wild
west
saloon
with
will
smith
and
those
weird
spider
bots
seems
like
the
most
refreshing
thing
that
wouldve
been
available
that
was
off
topic
but
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
with
traits
common
to
a
steam
beer
and
alcohol
that
is
undetectable
even
at
dead
warm
temperatures
a
little
drier
than
most
steam
beers
with
less
fruitiness
served
on
tap
at
southern
tier
brewing
and
from
a
bottle
single
finger
white
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
clear
bright
deep
golden
body
musty
pale
malts
hint
of
wood
musty
lemons
and
also
some
lemon
custard
sweetness
flavor
is
fairly
bitter
but
also
has
a
tropical
and
lemon
sweetness
balancing
it
out
sharp
herbal
hop
finish
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
i
have
only
had
a
few
steam
beers
this
one
seems
to
be
a
little
more
boozy
than
any
other
u
have
had
as
i
dictated
by
the
2x
definitely
worth
trying
tastes
a
bit
strange
sweet
and
tea
like
honeyed
malt
mostly
and
a
touch
of
something
floral
vague
fruit
candy
sweetness
seems
like
any
given
euro
strong
lager
past
its
prime
a
little
yeast
fruitiness
though
the
flavors
merely
sit
there
and
dont
coalesce
at
all
watery
and
a
touch
metallic
also
not
recommended
d
poor
flavor
and
body
kill
the
drinkability
honey
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
untoasted
grain
and
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
barley
and
honey
flavors
with
a
faint
touch
of
earthy
hop
bittering
medium
light
bodied
and
creamy
with
fizzy
carbonation
this
is
the
last
of
the
strange
historical
beers
12
pack
and
they
were
all
pretty
mundane
this
one
is
the
pick
of
the
litter
i
think
came
from
a
beers
of
america
12
pack
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
that
produced
a
slightly
off
white
foamy
head
that
faded
very
fast
to
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
a
mediumlow
amount
of
carbonation
smells
very
similar
to
many
other
minhas
beers
i
pick
up
lots
of
malts
and
slight
sweet
smell
at
first
i
taste
some
carmel
malts
and
thats
about
it
a
very
weak
finish
slightly
smooth
mouthfeel
it
is
a
pretty
okay
beer
very
drinkable
not
great
but
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
dry
it
was
unenjoyable
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
stuff
again
d
not
bad
i
certainly
like
this
steam
beer
better
than
anchor
this
is
nothing
all
that
special
but
its
decent
enough
smooth
and
easy
drinking
notes
the
only
thing
that
comes
close
the
style
is
the
appearance
after
that
it
goes
way
off
the
map
it
is
drinkable
but
boring
and
i
have
noticed
that
all
the
beers
in
this
mixed
18
pack
are
oddly
similar
to
each
other
the
best
part
of
this
18
pack
is
the
book
that
came
with
it
this
is
not
one
i
seek
out
again
it
really
doesnt
do
much
for
me
it
did
drink
real
easy
so
you
could
session
it
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
not
too
exciting
when
i
think
california
commonsteam
beer
i
think
anchor
steam
as
the
benchmark
this
one
misses
by
a
lot
d
this
is
easy
to
drink
although
the
taste
is
not
the
best
would
be
okay
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
nothing
overly
offensive
but
nothing
seems
worth
seeking
out
again
flavors
are
flat
and
body
is
overly
assertive
with
carbonation
too
bad
i
was
hoping
for
something
better
seems
to
approach
style
more
effectively
as
it
warms
but
its
just
lacking
d
not
a
bad
brew
it
could
be
better
thats
for
sure
but
it
went
down
easy
and
you
know
what
id
drink
another
i
just
might
its
not
bad
at
all
it
is
very
mediocre
but
its
not
on
the
bad
side
of
mediocre
d
low
i
could
barely
finish
it
close
to
a
drain
pour
i
got
this
beer
in
a
sampler
pack
that
said
brewed
bottled
by
mdii
rochester
ny
and
came
in
a
tin
case
with
a
book
the
history
of
beer
in
america
the
best
part
of
the
sampler
pack
was
the
book
and
the
case
this
beer
has
an
amber
color
pours
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
much
of
an
aroma
and
left
a
coppery
taste
in
my
mouth
it
reminded
me
of
the
taste
from
the
old
water
fountains
in
school
i
am
no
big
fan
of
this
beer
would
not
recommend
it
nor
will
i
buy
it
again
drinkability
not
really
a
bad
beer
or
a
drain
pour
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
after
this
sampler
is
done
seems
contracted
out
too
many
times
like
it
is
just
a
gimmick
to
sell
the
sampler
case
again
just
like
the
minhas
piedmont
porter
this
tastes
very
much
like
beer
ive
had
and
disliked
from
canadian
breweries
is
it
their
yeast
strain
that
makes
this
beer
less
than
desireable
if
you
had
a
friend
that
isnt
a
beer
fan
but
wanted
to
drink
on
this
is
a
very
inoffensive
beer
to
let
them
try
the
flavor
isnt
that
much
stronger
than
beer
flavored
water
this
12
oz
bottle
is
the
best
of
the
minhas
samplers
so
far
pours
an
attractive
clear
copper
amber
with
a
small
beige
head
that
leaves
some
patchy
lacing
aroma
reveals
some
toffee
maltiness
and
some
spicy
hops
understated
but
decent
light
body
is
well
carbonated
taste
has
a
lot
of
malty
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
balanced
by
an
earthy
hop
bitterness
aroma
promised
more
than
the
taste
could
muster
but
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
id
drink
this
if
offered
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
almost
nondescript
in
aroma
theres
some
caramel
but
thats
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
things
start
off
with
a
light
malt
and
grain
flavor
upfront
taste
turns
almost
seltzerlike
midway
hops
are
very
light
toward
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bland
and
uninviting
finish
disappointing
for
a
commercial
brewer
honestly
ive
homebrewed
better
batches
of
this
style
a
pretty
light
tasting
beer
just
above
most
of
the
bmc
stuff
so
slightly
more
drinkable
its
a
shame
the
look
of
it
was
the
best
feature
this
is
my
first
beer
out
of
the
american
beer
gift
pack
and
i
hope
the
rest
are
not
as
butchered
as
this
beer
was
d
fair
tasting
i
could
see
drinking
several
of
these
on
the
right
occasion
but
hard
to
recommend
it
as
more
than
average
d
a
slightly
below
average
brew
thats
a
shame
since
the
appearance
is
so
beautiful
this
one
is
soft
and
gentle
like
a
cc
should
be
but
it
suffers
from
a
water
mouthfeel
and
overriding
flavors
and
aromas
of
metal
the
beer
poured
a
very
clear
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
which
began
to
disappear
quickly
the
aroma
was
quite
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
is
also
malty
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
seems
to
work
well
for
this
brew
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
is
nonoffensive
but
also
lacks
depth
dont
drink
and
review
i
dont
find
any
of
the
strong
negatives
others
noted
which
i
think
may
have
to
do
more
with
storage
and
freshness
than
anything
else
this
brewer
doesnt
print
any
brewedbest
by
dates
which
is
kinda
of
dumb
d
gotta
admit
half
way
through
it
was
a
sink
pour
after
all
i
had
two
more
in
the
pack
i
had
yet
to
try
im
not
a
big
fan
of
weak
beers
ageless
and
awful
pours
a
nice
coppery
amber
very
faint
foam
and
bubbles
the
aroma
is
deeply
malty
and
a
little
viney
a
little
odd
the
taste
is
also
vine
but
a
better
crisper
malt
flavor
definetly
hard
water
used
for
this
brew
light
yet
crisp
hops
certainly
refreshing
yet
a
little
bland
a
few
odd
flavors
for
such
a
style
although
very
easy
to
drink
another
beer
that
pours
out
pretty
flat
the
head
of
foam
dies
down
pretty
quick
kinda
reddishgold
color
with
just
a
little
bit
of
small
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
not
much
body
to
this
beer
i
had
two
of
them
straight
from
the
bottle
and
didnt
noticed
the
flaws
until
i
poured
the
third
bottle
into
a
glass
overall
it
wasnt
that
bad
but
could
be
better
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
brew
first
one
not
very
drinkable
but
after
a
few
i
could
see
it
getting
easier
a
dark
copper
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
evident
smells
of
a
flat
caramel
malt
sweet
taste
is
thin
aqueous
consistent
with
the
smell
some
biscuit
somewhat
flat
with
very
tiny
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
that
cardboard
quality
but
not
horrible
its
drinkable
a
touch
of
some
cereal
qualities
quite
sweet
and
on
the
refreshing
side
i
guess
not
one
to
recommend
but
nothing
to
pour
down
the
drain
necessarily
i
would
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
for
lack
of
any
quality
competition
its
doable
to
my
surprise
its
a
fairly
tasty
little
malty
drink
sweet
and
malty
though
the
slight
flash
of
hops
on
the
aftertaste
seem
a
bit
underwhelming
the
soft
smoothness
of
the
liquid
almost
makes
up
for
it
making
this
by
far
the
most
drinkable
beer
from
this
brewery
ive
tried
cheers
much
thicker
than
i
expected
for
this
style
has
a
bubbly
little
bit
of
carbonation
at
the
end
would
make
a
very
nice
sixpack
if
you
like
this
style
this
actually
one
of
the
more
pleasant
malty
concoctions
ive
had
in
some
time
nothing
remarkable
but
a
welcome
brew
overall
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
ive
definitely
had
worse
beer
2
of
the
beers
of
america
historical
collection
this
beer
just
seems
like
a
slighty
different
tasting
macro
brew
to
me
nothing
obviously
wrong
with
it
just
not
much
good
to
say
about
it
either
barbary
coast
gold
rush
style
beer
was
amber
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
was
large
to
start
with
but
within
a
few
minutes
only
a
thin
layer
remained
the
aroma
was
mainly
malt
the
taste
was
good
a
malt
base
with
good
hop
flavor
and
a
little
bitterness
the
body
and
carbonation
were
medium
good
drinkability
good
beer
after
not
having
had
a
bottle
in
several
years
ive
forgotten
what
anchor
steam
tastes
like
its
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
barbary
coast
gold
rush
is
better
beer
than
the
originator
of
the
style
but
its
a
tasty
drinkable
little
creation
that
does
the
style
proud
i
hope
the
rest
of
this
historical
collection
are
at
least
as
good
pours
a
clear
amber
with
just
a
ring
of
head
the
smell
isnt
very
pleasant
or
strong
light
scents
of
malt
and
rotting
apples
the
taste
consists
of
sour
malt
flavors
with
some
hints
of
hops
trying
come
out
but
they
just
cant
very
thin
body
that
is
fairly
flat
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
impressed
by
this
brew
at
all
at
least
i
only
bought
one
to
try
tastes
very
much
like
it
smells
dull
lots
of
fruit
with
almost
no
hop
to
speak
of
wheres
the
kick
wheres
the
high
carbonation
crispness
that
makes
a
good
common
steamer
so
darn
drinkable
this
body
tastes
pasteurized
too
smooth
and
flat
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
swear
this
was
a
shitty
import
instead
its
a
shitty
domestic
12
oz
bottle
poured
out
an
amber
color
it
had
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
long
it
smelled
of
malt
and
cloves
those
flavors
were
joined
by
a
caramel
taste
while
drinking
it
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
and
crisp
it
is
relatively
drinkable
but
in
terms
of
california
commons
it
doesnt
compare
to
anchor
steam
oelergud
overall
impression
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
fairly
mild
but
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
drinkability
is
very
good
i
was
a
little
worried
about
the
package
gift
thing
but
this
first
impression
has
me
interested
in
the
rest
surprisingly
malty
for
a
steam
beer
this
beer
lacked
anything
to
make
it
memorable
overall
rather
bland
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
semisweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
bisquit
malts
its
also
dry
with
a
lager
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
light
yet
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easily
and
finishes
dry
with
breadlike
notes
it
has
a
light
caramel
flavor
that
is
quite
quaffable
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
drinking
beer
its
not
the
best
around
but
it
goes
down
smooth
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
seasonal
sampler
so
ill
look
forward
to
having
this
again
next
year
this
was
more
interesting
than
i
expected
a
pretty
decent
choice
if
youre
jonesing
for
a
sweeter
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
creamy
goes
down
clean
and
smooth
this
brew
just
doesnt
really
grab
me
and
i
cant
see
myself
really
wanting
more
this
came
from
the
american
beer
twelve
pack
ill
be
interested
to
see
what
the
other
brews
bring
a
good
thirst
quenching
brew
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
frothy
head
there
is
a
faint
smell
of
sweet
barley
the
taste
is
also
mild
and
sweet
barley
the
mouthfell
is
a
little
harsh
on
the
carbonation
but
is
fairly
good
overall
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
not
that
bad
at
all
preseentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
an
odd
brew
pours
with
a
loud
tall
sand
colored
head
of
small
and
medium
bubbles
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
smattering
of
head
dust
light
amber
in
color
with
minimal
carbonation
streams
smells
of
sweet
grain
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
light
body
and
light
mouthfeel
nothing
too
distinctive
and
there
are
definitely
better
steam
beers
available
this
is
pretty
close
to
good
and
it
is
drinkable
but
the
finish
just
shears
it
apart
not
a
bad
offering
yet
nothing
spectacular
either
poured
out
to
a
medium
red
color
with
a
small
18
inch
head
of
foam
no
lacing
noted
aromas
of
malts
and
caramel
taste
was
decent
and
enjoyable
caramel
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
raw
molasses
were
present
some
grain
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
bland
kind
of
watery
drinkability
was
average
not
a
bad
amber
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
worth
a
try
my
fourth
selection
from
the
beers
of
america
collection
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
white
puffy
head
smell
presents
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
sweetness
taste
is
more
caramel
with
some
sweet
fruitiness
finish
is
more
malt
sweetness
but
not
much
else
another
misddle
of
the
road
beer
so
far
except
for
the
porter
i
think
they
may
have
put
different
labels
on
the
some
beers
overall
eck
not
so
great
as
ambers
go
id
rather
have
a
yuengling
any
day
of
the
week
poured
a
crystal
clear
medium
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
that
faded
rather
quickly
but
has
good
lace
decent
malt
aroma
a
bit
smokey
perhaps
watery
and
a
bit
sour
leaves
a
weird
bitterness
on
the
sides
of
your
tounge
dry
high
carbonation
and
not
very
drinkable
a
poor
attempt
at
an
amber
i
hope
the
other
5
are
not
as
bad
i
shoul
know
by
now
not
to
get
sucked
in
by
marketing
i
guess
i
am
just
curious
pours
a
dark
copper
auburnish
color
golden
around
the
sides
very
little
head
even
though
i
gave
a
vigorous
pour
thin
cap
across
the
top
i
really
liked
the
color
but
the
lack
of
head
and
lacing
is
disappointing
aroma
is
weak
but
caramelly
and
toasty
a
fruity
sweetness
begins
the
taste
with
apple
notes
caramel
sugars
come
in
next
and
then
a
more
sour
flavor
follows
hops
seem
to
be
there
but
too
weak
and
i
cant
really
discern
a
flavor
a
little
soapy
in
the
mouth
too
finish
is
medicinal
and
kills
what
may
have
been
good
from
this
beer
starts
out
decent
but
goes
down
from
there
also
the
pamphlet
that
came
with
this
said
it
was
a
steam
beer
which
is
a
joke
i
should
mark
it
much
lower
if
the
brewers
were
trying
to
make
a
steam
beer
out
of
this
but
ill
keep
the
ratings
as
is
for
it
being
an
amber
part
of
the
limited
edition
beers
of
america
collection
this
one
pours
a
brilliant
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
seens
to
want
to
stay
around
on
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
slightly
caramel
sweet
with
a
fairly
grainey
character
the
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
nose
the
caramel
malt
is
a
bit
more
prevalent
and
hte
grainey
quality
is
more
subdued
but
not
all
that
bad
the
feel
is
a
touch
light
for
me
wih
a
rather
hearty
carbonation
overall
this
is
rather
plain
the
flavors
could
use
a
little
hop
to
back
it
up
i
would
like
a
bit
more
body
as
well
i
grabbed
this
set
because
i
recently
toured
the
huber
brewery
and
wanted
to
see
what
this
was
all
about
poursa
medium
amber
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
vanishes
aroma
is
slight
malty
grainy
maybe
a
touch
of
roastiness
flavor
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
a
nondescript
hop
follow
through
a
little
offtasting
but
nothing
i
can
put
my
finger
on
just
not
well
balanced
as
my
girlfriend
would
say
its
beer
not
exciting
not
terrible
drinkable
but
not
memorable
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
long
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nothing
special
a
little
malt
and
a
little
hops
pretty
plain
the
flavor
has
a
caramel
malt
character
but
seems
really
watered
down
hmm
flavor
would
be
ok
if
they
wouldnt
use
so
much
water
nothing
to
see
here

the

of
my
beautiful

aroma
is

very
light

it
at

and
its

5560
f
hops
are
detectable
in
the

but
not
in
the

mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
but
well
carbonated
although
i
got
little
or
no
head
on
the
first
half
will
finish
the
second
half
when
the
bbq
burgers
come
off
the
grill
on
a
fine
day
like
this
in
mid
winter
roll
out
the
grill
have
a
brew
and
seize
the
day
my
final
beer
from
the
american
beer
history
collection
the
pamphlet
that
come
with
the
collection
says
this
is
a
californea
commonsteam
beer
the
appearance
is
carmel
amber
with
weak
head
aroma
is
lightly
malty
and
somewhat
generic
flavor
is
lightly
malty
also
with
pronounced
wateriness
if
this
is
a
steam
beer
it
could
only
be
described
as
very
watered
down
anchor
steam
drinkability
is
okay
for
a
beer
this
dark
in
color
it
works
well
as
a
thrist
quencher
poured
a
clear
copper
carmel
color
a
little
layer
of
head
stays
but
not
too
much
smells
slightly
malty
but
nothing
that
storong
no
trace
of
hops
in
the
nose
hops
are
a
little
more
present
in
the
flavor
but
this
beer
isnt
that
outstanding
in
any
way
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
moderately
carbonated
ok
beer
at
best
translucent

hue
smallish
slightly

simple

very

i
enjoyed

very

its
as
good
as
any
amber
lager
i
have
tried
amber
in
color
topped
by
a
stiff
foamy
persistent
cap
looks
good
great

this
smells
like
a

beer
grain
honey
biscuit
soft

the
taste
is
intriguing
theres
the

right
away

now
more

a

here
keeps
it

great

nothing
over
the

smooth
and
wellcrafted

this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
final
thoughts
i
had
this
fresh
over
a
month
ago
and
it
was
even
tastier
usually
i
wouldnt
suggest
springing
for
a
sixer
but
with
the
high
abv
and
summits
low
prices
locally
it
is
a
steal
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
overall
cant
say
ill
put
this
ahead
of
many
other
possibilities
but
it
is
interesting
and
ill
give
some
credit
for
that

thanks
daftpatrick
for
the
opportunity
onot
one
of
my
favorite
unchained
offerings
the
writeup
sounded
great
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
pretty
good
experimental
beer
i
expected
more
exciting
flavors
from
the
maple
syrup
and
spruce
but
didnt
detect
much
of
it
in
the
taste
ive
never
had
such
a
bitter
hoppy
lager
is
it
an
ipl
or
an
ipcc
and
it
was
pretty
good
its
already
really
good
as
it
is
but
like
i
said
earlier
i
feel
that
the
hops
overpowered
the
malt
and
the
rest
of
the
flavors
a
little
too
much
some
age
to
mellow
out
the
hops
might
do
well
for
it
and
summit
itself
even
suggests
aging
the
bitterness
is
just
way
too
much
in
this
for
me
harsh
bitterness
drowns
out
the
maple
and
spruce
with
just
a
bit
of
maltiness
in
the
background
this
is
amazing
stuff
from
summit
i
am
sad
to
think
that
soon
its
not
going
to
be
available
ive
been
stockpiling
and
subsequently
drinking
six
packs
it
is
big
and
bold
and
bitter
the
taste
is
smooth
yet
bitter
and
piney
there
is
a
faint
trace
of
the
maple
syrup
this
is
a
perfect
beer
from
a
cold
mn
fall
night
overall
i
was
expecting
this
to
taste
a
little
weirder
than
it
did
it
mostly
tasted
like
a
pretty
standard
pale
ale
to
me
worth
a
try
o
i
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
especially
after
giving
it
a
chance
to
warm
up
overall
a
very
good
twist
on
a
cali
common
style
brew
good
bitter
and
piney
taste
of
hops
and
spruce
tips
along
with
some
good
sweet
malt
notes
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
beer
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
lagers
and
the
summit
unchained
series
has
been
more
miss
than
hit
for
me
but
this
one
has
been
a
pleasant
surprise
i
cant
say
i
really
notice
the
maple
syrup
or
spruce
tips
but
if
i
were
forced
to
drink
lagers
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
would
put
it
in
my
rotation
its
fairly
balanced
with
a
clean
bitter
finish
and
a
maltiness
that
lives
up
to
its
dark
well
past
amber
hue
can
i
detect
maple
no
did
i
like
it
yeah
o
while
the
smell
is
lacking
the
flavor
and
appearance
are
outstanding
this
is
a
welcome
addition
to
my
fridge
while
its
available
i
hope
it
becomes
at
least
a
seasonal
if
not
a
regular
in
summits
stable
o
herkulean
woods
as
the
name
suggests
is
a
big
and
bold
earthy
beer
with
deep
malt
and
maple
syrup
complexity
that
underlines
its
aggressive
hop
bite
and
sharp
spruce
addition
this
is
very
nice
indeed
o
fascinating
and
tasty
lager
i
fully
expected
it
to
be
much
more
malty
with
a
subtle
hoppine
presence
i
was
wrong
if
you
like
a
big
hop
and
pine
bitter
beer
you
should
give
this
a
try
dark
amber
color
pleasant
if
weak
aroma
with
pine
well
spruce
i
guess
evident
this
is
a
much
more
bitter
beer
than
i
usually
like
but
i
like
this
one
because
of
the
mix
of
the
maple
syrup
with
the
bitters
of
the
hopstips
this
is
especially
evident
in
the
finish
piney
bitterness
with
a
very
nice
sweetness
very
good
summit
kudos
to
brewer
christian
dixon
a
high
in
bitterness
beer
i
actually
like
nice
job
summit
a
touch
disappointed
that
the
maple
syrup
was
evidently
spilled
on
the
brewery
floor
must
have
made
quite
the
mess
but
whats
left
behind
is
a
very
good
beer
will
have
no
trouble
putting
a
couple
of
these
down
with
my
winning
poker
hands
tomorrow
night
overall
this
is
a
very
good
strong
sweet
and
bitter
lager
that
fits
in
nicely
with
the
oktoberfests
of
the
season
colorados
version
of
anchor
steam
is
pretty
comparable
though
not
quite
up
to
the
original
a
little
different
than
what
you
might
expect
but
still
pretty
decent
part
of
a
sampler
pack
when
i
tried
it
and
that
was
a
good
way
to
go
dated
best
before
4
27
14
so
its
creeping
on
4
months
past
home
tasting
12oz
can
into
tulip
glass
5314
amber
lager
the
can
says
something
like
quite
possibly
the
best
american
amber
lager
in
the
world
but
its
powered
by
big
amber
malt
that
hasnt
left
much
sugar
behind
sessionable
because
of
its
cleanness

poured
this

into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
amber
color
and
poured
a
regular
but
tan
head
however
the
head
did
not
hang
around
long
the
smelled
like
caramel
and
tasted
a
biy
t
like
it
also
it
was
too
sweet
in
fact
i
liked
it
at
first
but
by
the
last
of
the
brew
it
was
just
too
sweet
not

a
very
enjoyable
lighter
beer
very
well
done
easy
drinking
malty
bliss
pours
a
moderate
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
some
light
grain
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
fruit
flavor
is
likewise
pretty
tame
without
very
much
going
on
lightmedium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
though
the
body
is
just
a
bit
chewy
average
beer
is
fine
except
there
is
a
huge
aftertaste
that
the
more
you
drink
the
more
work
it
does
on
your
palate
it
is
acrid
and
harsh
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
nice
sweet
mildly
a
little
yeasty
a
decent
steam
beer
buried
under
the
avalache
of
the
aftertaste
too
bad
mulligan
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
a
hard
finish
on
the
palate
decent
try
overall
and
very
different
than
other
schlafly
offerings
of
which
i
am
a
big
fan
nice
flavor
that
paired
quite
well
with
the
pizza
and
garlic
bread
i
had
i
enjoyed
this
and
will
seek
this
out
again
m
d
crisp
and
clean
overall
a
forgettable
beer
by
an
otherwise
good
brewery
pours
a
clear
copper
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
hops
slight
citrus
slight
sweet
malt
and
slight
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
california
common
steam
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
sweet
malt
wet
hops
slight
roasted
malt
and
hint
of
citrus
overall
a
decent
beer
with
good
blend
o
im
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
is
a
nice
beer
d
nicely
done
it
is
balanced
drinkable
and
fits
the
style
well
o
this
is
simply
a
beer
that
doesnt
really
rise
above
its
mediocrity
do
an
interesting
take
on
a
california
common
this
carolina
common
its
pretty
bold
for
the
style
and
bit
rough
around
the
edges
i
really
enjoyed
the
draft
version
more
for
whatever
reason
it
seems
a
little
off
from
the
bottle
o
the
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
is
easy
to
drink
it
becomes
more
maltier
and
balanced
as
the
beer
warms
up
they
bill
this
as
a
carolina
common
ale
and
its
plenty
hoppy
for
the
style
and
is
a
great
local
alternative
to
anchor
steam
a
bit
more
hopforward
than
traditional
but
it
works
well
a
wellmade
delicious
easytodrink
refreshing
brew
certainly
sessionable
o
this
is
one
nice
lager
from
lake
louie
it
has
more
hops
that
previous
older
reviews
would
indicate
so
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
newer
recipe
since
it
has
made
a
return
o
the
odd
aroma
starts
to
remind
me
of
taco
shells
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
cheers
this
was
all
right
felt
like
a
juicedup
red
lager
at
times
but
it
wasnt
bad
pours
a
light
copper
in
color
in
the
taste
sweet
malts
and
grain
fruity
ale
yeast
and
a
mild
hop
balance
a
little
green
apple
caramel
tea
like
hop
bitterness
and
a
more
or
less
clean
finish
mild
but
a
decent
beer
glad
i
got
an
opportunity
to
try
it
while
inconsistent
at
times
i
really
do
appreciate
the
goingson
at
lake
louie
its
fantastic
to
see
such
a
small
operation
pumping
out
a
wide
variety
of
styles
and
taking
risks
well
done
tommy
its
drinkable
for
sure
but
not
the
lightbodied
simplefocus
lawnmower
beer
that
the
name
likely
suggests
its
best
served
cool
not
cold
while
watching
ones
bug
zapper
illuminate
the
night
air
overall
good
to
see
a
local
take
on
the
steam
beer
and
a
very
flavorful
take
it
is
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
key
malty
flavors
of
multigrain
bread
and
bitter
walnut
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
easy
enough
to
drink
glad
to
see
lake
louie
trying
their
hand
at
different
styles
like
this
the
best
part
is
that
each
component
is
not
overwhelming
which
makes
this
and
easily
sessionable
beer
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
very
good
for
the
style
slightly
bitter
and
very
malty
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
very
decent
ipa
a
little
darker
color
than
i
would
have
expected
and
a
decent
smell
and
head
on
it
taste
is
very
nice
doesnt
overwhelm
nor
underperform
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
some
you
should
as
its
a
very
nice
example
of
an
ipa
pours
clear
mahogany
with
cream
colored
2
finger
head
that
settles
back
down
to
a
quarter
inch
floating
layer
with
interesting
lacing
very
carbonated
this
beer
is
supposedly
made
with
primarily
a
black
malt
at
small
enough
amounts
to
appear
reddish
it
certainly
doesnt
smell
or
taste
like
any
black
malt
ive
ever
had
it
has
the
intensely
nutty
hazelnut
aroma
of
a
really
nice
brown
ale
with
light
amounts
of
grassy
herbal
hops
the
hops
do
a
nice
initial
pine
and
woody
strike
on
the
palate
and
dissipate
quickly
for
the
roasted
nut
flavored
malt
tones
with
just
a
tiniest
whisper
of
lychee
fruitlike
esters
the
brewery
claims
that
there
are
supposed
to
be
black
cherry
tones
but
my
tongue
says
lychee
instead
goes
down
easy
light
bodied
and
smooth
can
be
sessioned
if
you
are
smart
about
your
pace
somebody
somewhere
called
this
a
good
lawnmower
beer
id
have
to
agree
its
a
great
summer
thirst
quencher
with
enough
flavor
to
multitask
as
a
serviceable
sipper
as
well
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
meranguethick
frothy
head
clean
herbal
grassy
and
sweet
smell
pleasantly
soft
flowery
flavors
of
clover
honey
are
set
against
a
grainy
malty
base
a
great
big
clean
dose
of
citrusy
piney
hops
balance
beutifully
for
a
excellant
overall
beer
flavor
this
is
a
much
more
substantial
and
flavorful
summer
seasonal
than
the
usual
thin
watery
hot
weather
golden
whatevers
that
come
out
this
time
of
year
but
still
very
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lager
home
run
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
by
this
beer
while
the
name
lends
itself
to
the
beachbeer
ideology
i
see
this
rather
as
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
within
the
relative
safety
of
the
screen
porch
or
hammock
rock
solid
beer
probably
best
enjoyed
before
summer
even
rolls
in
draught
at
the
brewpub
during
rbsg09
toasty
amber
color
lightly
hazy
with
a
white
head
subtle
herbal
hops
and
toasty
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
great
example
of
balance
with
toasty
and
caramel
malt
flavors
mixing
with
herbal
hops
more
hop
flavor
than
anchor
steam
but
along
the
same
lines
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
very
solid
easier
drinking
offering
from
russian
river
like
pretty
much
every
beer
they
make
you
can
tell
that
a
lot
of
thought
was
put
into
its
construction
d
fairly
drinkable
interesting
and
somewhat
complex
but
not
one
i
would
return
to
again
and
again
had
this
ontap
at
the
brewpub
in
santa
rosa
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
like
the
history
of
the
style
and
the
california
connection
still
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
of
the
style
pours
a
light
orangeamber
with
a
relatively
thin
but
silken
head
and
superb
lacing
smells
relatively
light
and
grainy
and
with
a
very
light
lemony
fruitiness
tastes
less
grainy
but
there
is
still
a
bit
of
graininess
there
is
also
the
typical
ale
and
lager
combo
of
yeastiness
with
some
earthy
and
citrusy
hoppiness
some
more
of
that
light
lemon
flavor
and
a
finish
of
spent
grain
like
a
small
beer
very
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
great
steam
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
and
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
but
not
too
much
of
either
really
tasty
stuff
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
ddespite
the
frito
flavor
i
actually
like
this
beer
alot
it
was
incredibly
refreshing
i
would
have
this
again
rbsg09
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
pours
dark
orange
with
a
thick
cascading
lightbeige
head
aroma
is
nice
fresh
bread
dough
with
some
fruity
hops
and
a
metallic
note
flavor
is
milky
and
doughy
with
light
caramel
sweetness
and
some
citrus
nice
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
definitely
has
a
rr
twist
on
a
style
that
i
typically
do
not
order
this
one
is
a
lot
better
after
it
has
warmed
for
at
least
10
minutes
not
bad
but
with
so
many
others
on
the
board
i
would
go
for
something
else
the
taste
is
pine
a
hint
of
grass
and
only
a
weak
burnt
toast
flavour
for
the
malt
its
too
bitter
mostly
just
hops
without
the
fullness
of
body
or
flavours
to
back
this
up
it
may
not
be
very
bitter
on
an
absolute
scale
but
its
far
too
bitter
considering
its
other
qualities
drinkability
damn
i
wish
i
had
tried
this
earlier
i
see
a
growler
of
this
in
the
future
this
coming
summer
hopefully
its
still
around
the
carbonation
was
good
and
overall
the
beer
was
crisp
and
very
drinkable
had
it
on
tap
locally
great
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
biscuit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
overall
im
normally
a
big
fan
of
amber
ales
but
in
this
instance
im
not
excited
about
it
this
is
their
flagship
beer
the
one
that
everyone
in
the
area
knows
about
i
am
no
more
than
10
minutes
from
this
brewery
and
have
yet
to
go
to
it
i
am
hoping
that
this
is
a
bad
batch
and
not
the
standard
i
really
want
to
give
this
another
try
directly
from
the
brewery
hopefully
it
will
be
different
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
strong
yeast
aroma
with
some
bready
malt
and
a
pronounced
graininess
a
little
bit
of
grass
and
floral
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
sort
of
bland
its
just
sort
of
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
flavor
its
mostly
just
grainy
and
bland
o
overall
a
very
average
beer
a
slightly
sweet
fairly
light
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
but
wont
set
the
world
on
fire
with
what
it
does
which
is
nothing
exceptional
but
not
i
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
bad
beer
either
all
in
all
this
sucks
no
worries
about
this
one
i
am
starting
to
think
that
this
brewery
wants
to
be
budweiser
no
flavors
just
water
drink
2nd
time
ive
had
this
beer
1st
time
on
draft
wasnt
too
bad
wasnt
too
good
just
a
nice
run
of
the
mill
beer
and
tradition
of
cal
common
we
all
know
the
benchmark
the
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
and
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
toffee
earth
and
some
citrus
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
special
here
but
nothing
too
offensive
either
pours

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
liquorama
upland
ca
an
uneventful
drink
no
reason
to
try
again
im
cleansing
my
palate
and
my
memory
of
this
beer
with
a
rip
roaring
red
d
would
have
enjoyed
just
a
touch
more
hops
in
this
didnt
find
them
anywhere
kinda
felt
unbalanced
towards
adjuncts
like
a
macro
lager
or
something
with
caramel
malt
added
not
that
great
this
is
almost
a
drain
pour
for
me
would
market
better
as
a
british
pale
ale
maybe
im
just
too
sensitive
to
diacetyl
but
in
this
beer
it
adversely
affects
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
only
made
it
through
half
the
bottle
and
that
still
felt
like
several
sips
too
many
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
somewhere
id
probably
try
to
talk
the
bartender
into
giving
me
a
sample
just
to
compare
it
to
the
bottle
but
if
i
had
to
make
a
decision
based
on
this
bottle
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
nor
could
i
recommend
it
not
too
bad
though
its
loose
ends
could
be
tightened
surprising
very
hoppy
but
balanced
i
really
liked
this
but
it
had
a
strangely
metallic
aftertaste
that
i
couldnt
account
for
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
really
tasty
overall
a
rather
flavourful
brew
imbedded
within
a
unique
style
sublimely
balanced
and
nuanced
id
like
to
sample
this
on
tap
overall
definitely
a
nice
spring
beer
that
has
a
lively
taste
and
a
surprising
hoppy
note
the
flavor
starts
peppery
and
herbal
from
the
hops
which
bring
out
a
sort
of
earthy
complimentary
malt
element
with
lagerlike
yeast
flavors
bringin
some
mineral
elements
along
with
toastiness
in
the
malt
and
a
light
almondlike
nutty
sweetness
with
a
subtle
caramel
or
vienna
flavor
which
compliments
the
yeast
and
adds
a
bit
of
depth
overall
i
would
not
say
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
better
than
average
in
most
regards
including
drinkability
i
would
try
this
on
draft
the
rich
roasted
caramel
malts
play
up
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
and
the
bitterness
is
must
by
it
finishes
clean
and
balanced
not
sure
how
often
i
would
have
this
not
a
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
kind
of
beer
overall
ok
but
nothing
too
special
it
has
the
nice
soft
feel
soft
minerals
that
iced
tea
is
really
different
and
the
candy
notes
are
also
off
for
a
steam
beer
but
an
interesting
twist
on
it
i
wouldnt
say
i
didnt
enjoy
this
a
bit
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
just
not
what
i
expected
overall
for
3
25
a
pint
i
dont
feel
let
down
but
i
will
not
be
trying
this
beer
again
unless
it
is
in
a
bottle
and
it
is
free
overall
above
average
beer
that
has
glimmers
of
being
good
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
want
another
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
a
complete
bore
tastes
like
something
one
would
find
in
a
case
of
kirkland
generic
beer
from
costco
i
cant
believe
this
sells
for
the
same
price
as
deschutes
offerings
in
the
supermarket
widmer
was
on
my
no
no
list
for
years
they
just
hit
the

button
translucent

some

not

that
it

fantastic
session
ale
itd
be
nice
to
see
more
stuff
like
this
on
the
shelves
o
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
not
dominated
by
any
single
characteristic
but
the
herbal
hops
are
balanced
well
by
everything
else
going
on
seems
to
have
held
up
even
greater
than
4
months
after
bottling
a
quick
drinker
wish
this
was
a
little
fresher
seems
to
have
faded
a
bit
dull
components
make
for
an
unmemorable
beer
but
some
bitterness
keeps
it
alive
an
average
cream
ale
that
doesnt
stand
out
in
its
class
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
minimal
lace
and
copper
color
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
spicy
hops
flavor
is
biscuity
malt
and
spicy
hops
and
balancing
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
co2
is
appropriate
to
style
overall
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
nice
job
on
a
cali
common
brew
pours
a
dark
copper
with
tanish

that
foams
up
pretty
good
with
a
hard
pour
head
sticks
around
in
a
thin
film
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
ok
smells
like
bread
fruity
mango
or
peach
maybe
no
hops
really
the
taste
very
much
a
bread
craker
taste
not
really
tasting
the
fruit
i
smell
there
are
no
hops
just
a
slight
bitterness
and
not
to
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
it
has
body
just
not
really
flavor
to
match
overall
i
would
drink
this
anytime
and
could
problay
drink
a
ton
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
more
flavor
then
ur
standard
beer
i
guess
i
went
with
a
fairly
aggro
pour
which
resulted
in
a
surprisingly
brief
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
relatively
low
retention
it
is
a
cool
day
and
there
is
little
to
no
humidity
and
the
lack
of
head
retention
was
surprising
color
was
a
deepcopper
with
nequality
clarity
and
if
there
was
a
way
to
cash
it
in
at
my
local
recycling
center
i
would
be
on
my
way
there
now
i
had
a
babe
of
a
gf
in
the
early
1990s
and
her
hair
was
both
coppercolored
and
coarse
as
wire
i
wonder
if
she
braids
it
up
and
sells
it
as
scrap
man
what
a
beauty
both
the
gf
and
the
beer
nose
was
solidly
malty
with
a
slightly
mintygrassy
scent
underneath
i
was
vaguely
reminded
of
girl
scout
mint
cookies
taste
was
semisweet
and
quite
tasty
it
occurred
to
me
in
writing
this
review
that
i
have
never
reviewed
anchor
steam
despite
it
being
one
of
the
first
micros
i
ever
put
up
to
my
lips
i
wonder
how
the
two
will
compare
this
was
worthwhile
cheers
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
biscuit
grain
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
distinct
grass
forward
aroma
and
flavor
if
you
like
the
style
youll
like
this
i
think
its
ok
i
was
expecting
almost
a
pilsner
style
color
but
this
was
much
darker
than
a
pilsner
not
a
heavy
hop
smell
very
bready
and
almost
lagerish
taste
was
very
similar
not
quite
a
smooth
dark
winter
ale
but
also
not
quite
a
light
summer
ale
essentially
a
beer
to
have
around
yearround
i
think
very
nice
taste
and
mouthfeel
again
very
lagerish
but
extremely
pleasant
and
enjoyable
i
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
o
a
style
that
i
do
not
come
across
very
often
but
i
do
enjoy
trying
when
i
get
the
chance
a
little
dryer
than
i
would
have
expected
for
the
style
but
enjoyable
and
sessionable
overall
while
not
a
flavorful
powerhouse
it
does
have
a
nice
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
taste
with
just
enough
complexity
to
not
be
boring
but
not
too
much
too
take
away
from
its
more
session
like
at
4
7
abv
and
easy
drinking
qualities
overall
nice
take
on
the
style
though
im
not
big
on
the
style
to
begin
with
much
like
the
ninkasi
spring
reign
i
had
last
night
this
does
well
as
a
spring
seasonal
release
easy
drinker
downright
sessionable
this
style
isnt
quite
as
common
as
the
name
would
suggest
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
bronze
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
light
wheat
a
touch
of
funky
wheat
and
a
light
dusting
of
powdered
sugar
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mild
biscuit
greens
light
grass
flowers
and
a
twinge
of
nougat
yeah
im
not
sure
where
that
came
from
either
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
little
steam
beer
something
i
could
see
seasonal
drinkers
really
digging
in
the
sunshiny
months
taste
is
very
palatepleasing
with
a
light
body
but
full
of
flavor
i
get
enough
citrus
hops
and
bready
malts
to
be
an
ideal
balance
for
a
sessionstyle
spring
lager
very
enjoyable
and
welldone
o
this
beer
may
not
appeal
to
mainstream
beer
drinkers
but
its
very
good
considering
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
aromas
and
flavors
imparted
by
the
columbus
hops
and
the
dryness
o
this
is
a
good
steam
beer
maybe
even
better
than
the
original
poured
a
clearish
brown
body
with
decent
head
and
lace
on
top
of
a
slightly
fruity
but
more
piney
earthy
hop
aroma
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
just
found
it
bland
boring
and
a
little
toned
down
for
the
masses
there
is
a
good
hop
presence
but
its
more
of
just
some
minor
earthy
piney
hops
that
have
a
little
citric
to
them
and
help
give
off
an
easy
crisp
and
dry
finish
not
much
else
going
on
as
some
fruit
and
sweet
notes
are
muted
and
the
beer
isnt
watery
but
definitely
a
thinner
body
helps
you
pound
it
pretty
tasty
not
fantastic
but
once
you
get
past
the
lack
of
a
head
its
not
a
bad
beer
all
in
all
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
o
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
the
first
one
i
didnt
like
so
much
i
had
another
a
few
weeks
later
and
it
really
is
starting
to
work
for
me
at
first
i
thought
there
wasnt
enough
hop
to
balance
out
the
flavor
but
i
changed
my
mind
though
not
ad
hoppy
as
some
of
my
more
usual
beers
it
is
actually
quite
balanced
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
its
a
tasty
beer
but
its
missing
something
to
really
make
it
pop
overall
a
nice
beer
and
very
timely
for
the
coming
of
spring
serving
type
12oz
bottle
a
style
of
beer
id
like
to
see
come
around
a
little
more
this
is
a
great
spring
seasonal
with
all
the
necessary
attributes
it
pours
an
amber
to
copper
color
clean
and
neat
with
an
inch
of
lasting
white
head
the
nose
is
pretty
well
hopped
a
little
citrusy
with
a
fairly
big
malt
profile
for
such
a
light
and
crisp
beer
there
isnt
rye
in
this
but
is
has
a
certain
spice
element
to
the
smell
as
well
the
flavor
is
really
well
balanced
plenty
of
grain
happening
some
caramel
sweetness
a
little
tannic
thing
going
on
and
a
good
size
body
the
hops
are
exclusively
in
the
finish
hardly
bitter
at
all
but
of
a
neutral
fruity
feel
to
them
good
compliment
to
the
bigger
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
super
crisp
and
refreshing
and
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
i
like
it
in
early
spring
here
because
its
got
the
clean
satisfying
drinkability
and
summery
hop
complexion
but
it
also
has
enough
body
to
be
useful
when
its
still
cold
out
a
well
made
example
of
a
style
that
i
am
finding
i
really
enjoy
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
steam
beer
columbia
common
is
a
beautiful
beer
it
pours
out
a
brilliant
copper
color
capped
with
a
lovely
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
weak
and
whats
there
of
the
toasted
malts
is
a
bit
it
ticks
the
flavor
marks
just
right
though
with
that
whole
not
a
lager
not
yet
an
ale
thing
going
on
with
a
wonderful
slight
malty
nuttiness
a
bit
of
hops
hang
out
with
a
grainy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
light
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
solid
a
solid
attempt
at
a
underbrewed
style
this
started
a
little
shakey
but
improved
as
it
warmed
very
drinkable
would
love
to
get
some
fresher
just
to
see
if
it
is
any
better
overall
a
surprisingly
tasty
beer
wasnt
expecting
much
here
but
this
is
an
excellent
mild
ale
overall
this
is
a
light
and
quaffable
brew
of
no
real
distinction
but
im
always
willing
to
try
a
loweralcohol
beer
from
a
reputable
brewery
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
sprouts
market
in
san
diego
ive
got
five
more
bottles
from
the
sixer
so
this
will
probably
end
up
at
dipa
helper
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
the
nose
offers
very
little
the
flavor
follows
there
isnt
much
here
its
a
simple
subtle
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bit
thin
this
just
isnt
for
me
i
need
something
a
little
more
bold
and
flavorful
the
color
is
reall
nice
brown
with
maybe
a
very
slight
redish
hue
there
is
a
slight
hoppiness
in
the
nose
not
strong
at
all
the
taste
is
similar
a
weak
hoppiness
and
a
watery
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
and
it
seems
pretty
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
few
and
watch
a
game
not
heavy
at
all
a
flavorful
but
still
light
ale
overall
while
this
beer
seems
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
its
actually
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
the
style
and
want
to
expand
beyond
anchor
steam
beer
o
while
this
beer
wont
win
any
points
for
originality
or
complexity
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
like
drinkable
an
enjoyable
steam
beer
well
suited
for
spring
and
easy
drinking
o
above
average
cool
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
spring
hop
taste
to
it
very
sessionable
beer
but
nothing
outstanding

solid
brew
from
a
solid
brewer
i
enjoyed
and
will
buy
all
i
can
get
this
is
quite
a
good

very
flavorful
solid
and
fitting
for
everyday
consumption

along
with
some

and
a
every
so
slight
citrus
note
the
taste
is
exactly
what
you
would
get
with
any
solid
lager
it
is
a
little
creamier
up
front
and
also
a
little
bitter
on
the
back
end
i
really
have
no
complaints
with
this
one
i
got
it
on
the
cheap
too
which
is
always
a
plus
its
just
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
good
lager
its
not
flashy
but
its
enjoyable
and
does
what
its
supposed
to
do
well
done
o
not
bad
its
nice
to
have
a
steam
beer
whoops
i
mean
california
common
not
from
anchor
id
never
turn
down
a
free
can
of
this
recommendation
dont
be
scared
by
the
description
this
ones
worth
seeking
out
oak
brown
with
a
medium
head
that
dissappears
quickly
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
smells
a
little
like
bud
light
which
is
a
turn
off
taste
is
a
little
acidic
lemons
and
pine
needles
carbonation
and
a
lightmedium
body
sour
flavor
dominates
but
isnt
so
much
that
its
distasteful
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
either
original
review
its
time
for
a
short
shorts
review
this
one
was
just
ok
it
was
for
sure
unique
and
it
had
an
interesting
slightly
sour
finish
it
was
nice
to
try
but
its
nor
really
something
that
i
think
needs
to
be
bottled
this
was
served
on
firkin
and
the
carbonation
was
very
low
overall
a
great
light
and
complex
beer
if
the
bitterness
was
just
a
touch
lower
i
could
drink
these
all
day
great
beer
some
quite
english
characteristics
i
havent
had
too
many
steam
beers
and
to
be
honest
i
havent
really
liked
any
of
the
ones
ive
tried
this
beer
seems
a
bit
thicker
than
other
ones
ive
had
but
i
enjoy
it
more
than
some
of
them
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
i
find
most
steam
beers
to
be
a
little
on
the
bland
side
but
shorts
kept
this
one
interesting
with
a
nice
malt
profile
and
little
bit
of
grapefruit
hop
flavors
that
worked
well
with
this
beer
and
it
made
it
stick
out
a
little
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
clean
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
when
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
what
i
liked
the
most
about
the
beer
was
the
balance
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
i
thought
they
were
both
pretty
nice
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
its
released
in
the
fall
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
a
great
summer
or
spring
release
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
its
hot
outside
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
could
see
myself
keeping
some
in
the
fridge
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
and
i
think
it
would
go
good
with
a
meal
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
hoppy
lagers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
just
as
good
as
i
remember
i
havent
tried
much
of
this
style
mainly
because
there
just
arent
that
many
examples
of
it
out
there
but
so
far
i
would
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
good
job
shorts
thanks
for
offering
another
solid
drinkable
beer
in
bottles
o
with
little
experience
in
the
style
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
maybe
something
of
a
blond
ale
the
hop
profile
was
a
surprise
pleasant
as
it
is
perplexing
i
have
no
idea
how
to
score
it
pretty
easy

i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
that
being
said
this
is
a
nice
and
refreshing

that
reduces
to
a

on

for

after

overall
this
is
a
very

hoppy
california
common

all
around
good

balance
and
very
smooth
and

to

a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
nice
easy

american
lager
id
have
this
again
as
a
nice
session
ale
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
thought
the
bitterness
dominated
the
beer
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
cheers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
shorts
sessionable
offerings
if
there
were
not
already
enough
reasons
to
come
visit
the
pub
in
bellaire
you
can
add
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
to
the
list
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
maybe
a
bit
overhopped
for
a
traditional
steam
beer
but
very
good
nonetheless
worth
a
shot
sampled
at
the
brewery
brewers
notes
traditional
northern
michigan
style
steam
beer
the
pour
was
anice
deep
straw
color
capped
with
a
mid
size
full
head
and
bright
white
lace
the
nose
is
initially
elusive
to
pinpoint
very
clean
and
neutral
but
has
some
hop
crispness
and
some
malt
and
some
esters
from
the
yeast
the
beer
has
a
dry
malty
flavor
balanced
with
hop
dryness
finish
is
dry
and
long
with
an
aftertaste
needs
to
be
quenched
with
another
