d
o
a
good
beer
i
havent
seen
any
of
this
since
2011
with
a
few
tweaks
it
could
be
great
i
think
the
age
definitely
did
this
beer
well
overall
this
is
a
fine
old
ale
that
probably
wont
drink
again
well
done
lets
move
on
this
is
one
well
assembled
beer
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
anytime
anywhere
thanks
mhenson42
for
the
opportunity
aramel
smell
coming
off
of
this
literally
took
me
by
surprise
nice
aroma
of
oak
and
alcohol
mixing
and
swirling
around
with
it
now
really
starting
to
pick
up
steam
the
warmer
it
got
so
complex
with
rich
earthy
tones
running
rampant
through
it
warm
oak
infused
notes
of
brandy
like
alcohol
running
over
the
tongue
so
sweet
and
sugary
as
you
roll
it
around
you
start
to
notice
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
to
this
one
way
down
deep
under
all
of
the
malt
there
was
a
subtle
bitter
hoppiness
very
grainy
and
earthy
but
it
was
there
and
really
pushed
through
on
the
finish
long
drawn
out
finish
it
was
soo
complex
with
every
sip
letting
you
discover
more
and
more
flavors
deep
dark
fruit
now
coming
through
for
me
really
started
to
actually
dominate
the
scene
all
together
huge
raisin
and
plum
notes
giving
it
that
sweet
but
yet
tart
dark
fruit
flavor
we
all
come
to
love
o
first
ive
had
of
this
style
but
after
reading
independences
description
is
feels
like
they
were
very
close
to
the
mark
on
this
beer
id
love
to
try
some
with
another
year
or
two
on
it
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
first
beer
from
independence
that
i
have
found
to
be
truly
noteworthy
going
to
have
to
pick
up
a
few
of
these
to
lay
down
again
overall
a
slightly
boozey
tasting
very
reserved
attempt
at
the
style
not
bad
by
any
means
but
falls
short
of
being
good
update
i
just
opened
another
2011
edition
of
this
beer
now
2
years
old
and
i
had
to
come
and
change
my
numbers
on
this
this
beer
is
truly
incredible
i
dont
know
if
i
have
weird
taste
or
if
this
is
just
a
very
hidden
gem
because
2011
editions
of
this
beer
seem
to
be
all
over
the
place
never
flying
off
the
shelves
and
the
reviews
arent
exactly
fantastic
on
here
i
was
pretty
new
to
craft
beer
when
i
first
had
this
but
coming
back
its
even
better
than
i
remember
it
not
sure
why
i
thought
alcohol
heat
was
not
very
discernible
though
its
very
present
which
is
awesome
and
that
roasted
leathermolasses
flavour
is
just
spot
on
its
like
being
able
to
drink
a
barbecue
which
should
be
every
texans
dream
i
would
imagine
the
stickiness
on
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
much
ill
admit
but
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
beers
and
i
encourage
other
lovers
of
roasted
malts
and
sweet
beers
to
partake
as
soon
as
possible
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
light
to
moderate
carbonation
but
leaning
more
towards
light
this
is
a
fairly
decent
take
on
the
style
but
there
are
others
that
are
better
it
is
a
decent
sipper
and
more
enjoyable
while
it
is
chilled
once
it
warms
up
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
of
a
disjointed
mess
that
doesnt
meld
well
due
to
its
lack
of
big
residual
malt
flavoring
i
expect
in
the
style
the
beer
was
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
tan
colored
thick
head
that
did
leave
some
nice
lacing
i
could
smell
apples
pears
a
hint
of
white
wine
and
a
caramel
background
the
taste
is
similar
i
got
some
alcohol
white
grape
apple
peel
and
lemon
its
medium
bodied
very
smooth
warming
and
dry
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
what
a
little
more
aging
would
do
to
it
opinion
i
dont
know
what
to
say
except
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
that
this
is
a
hard
category
to
score
well
in
because
the
competition
is
so
high
that
said
this
beer
is
very
thin
for
the
style
by
any
stretch
the
hops
are
pretty
aggressive
for
the
style
as
well
so
maybe
it
would
be
better
appreciated
once
it
has
been
cellared
for
45
years
either
way
it
is
decent
and
worth
a
shot
to
see
if
you
like
this
end
of
the
old
ale
spectrum
this
beer
pours
a
slight
copper
color
leaning
more
to
the
jaundiced
side
on
that
color
scale
with
an
offwhite
head
thats
minuscule
at
best
the
aromatics
are
rather
fruity
i
detected
hints
of
butterscotch
and
green
apple
which
i
have
to
admit
i
didnt
truly
expect
the
flavors
were
a
bit
on
the
side
of
apple
juice
mixed
in
with
some
buttery
notes
and
sweet
malt
to
carry
along
with
it
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
nice
it
was
carbonated
rather
nicely
but
did
have
an
acidic
quality
to
it
the
overall
on
this
beer
was
that
it
was
fine
it
didnt
wow
me
but
i
didnt
hate
it
either
im
not
sure
where
the
carbonation
issues
clarity
issues
and
other
stale
issues
that
i
see
complaints
of
are
coming
from
maybe
storage
is
an
issue
but
the
age
has
done
well
for
my
bottles
and
i
dont
seem
to
have
those
issues
at
all
think
this
was
the
first
beer
from
independence
we
had
overall
this
tasted
more
like
a
hybrid
of
dipa
and
american
barleywine
that
was
aged
long
enough
to
let
the
hops
fade
strange
for
an
old
ale
but
not
terrible
d
this
is
pretty
boozy
pours
a
clear
golden
red
color
body
with
a
small
white
head
quickly
diminishing
somewhat
musty
aroma
strong
dark
fruits
alcoholy
taste
somewhat
old
musty
taste
the
fruit
taste
mellows
in
the
aftertaste
hotter
as
it
warms
up
would
taste
better
aged
another
year
maybe
two
d
easy
enough
to
drink
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
combined
with
a
lack
of
flavor
complexity
make
it
difficult
to
enjoy
i
probably
wont
be
having
this
again
taste
is
heavily
leaning
towards
the
sweet
malts
burnt
caramel
toffee
and
crystal
malt
there
is
some
muscadine
grape
fruitiness
in
there
as
well
as
a
few
hints
of
raisins
and
figs
jasperilla
is
a
bit
watery
and
there
is
not
much
character
to
the
ale
never
will
be
called
overly
complex
i
enjoyed
drinking
my
half
of
the
bomber
though
and
would
consider
purchasing
again
pours
orangishbrown
with
not
much
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
malt
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
malty
sweetness
with
some
a
caramel
flavor
there
is
also
some
fruit
specifically
apple
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
never
reviewed
it
i
think
it
was
better
fresh
d
i
think
this
would
be
easier
to
drink
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
it
rather
than
seeing
it
in
the
fridge
and
saying
why
the
hell
not
this
beer
isnt
anything
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
d
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
it
fell
short
it
brings
back
great
memories
of
spending
time
in
texas
though
it
needs
more
of
a
malt
taste
and
for
the
body
to
be
thickened
up
it
was
nice
to
try
this
local
but
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
another
bomber
of
jasperilla
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
at
first
but
after
a
while
it
just
became
a
chore
to
keep
sipping
i
have
to
mark
this
one
down
on
drinkability
because
its
a
sipping
beer
not
a
session
drink
but
thats
the
nature
of
the
beast
with
most
old
ales
and
they
shouldnt
be
denigrated
for
it
once
you
get
a
taste
for
them
youre
hooked
verdict
im
happy
to
report
that
this
is
quite
a
tasty
and
complex
beer
and
would
be
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
with
a
cigar
in
the
evening
ill
be
cellaring
a
bottle
for
a
year
or
so
to
see
how
it
ages
pours
a
clear
medium
to
dark
copper
color
with
a
good
sized
bubbly
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
aromas
of
caramel
and
light
citrus
come
to
the
forefront
slight
alcohol
and
a
twinge
of
biscuit
round
things
out
smells
decent
but
smells
malty
sweet
very
little
hop
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
a
light
fruitiness
its
really
malty
sweet
almost
to
the
point
of
cloying
theres
a
strange
twang
in
the
background
that
i
cant
quite
identify
its
almost
metallic
or
phenolic
luckily
it
doesnt
stick
around
long
enough
to
ruin
this
completely
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
medium
mouthfeel
is
sticky
body
is
medium
to
thick
this
one
has
some
issues
it
could
be
my
fault
for
sitting
on
this
bottle
for
2
years
but
as
is
this
isnt
that
good
its
heavy
on
the
malt
without
enough
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
that
strange
taste
doesnt
help
much
either
id
love
to
give
a
fresh
bottle
a
try
overall
i
fell
semi
blessed
to
have
gotten
a
hold
of
this
vintage
offering
look
for
a
follow
up
review
of
the
2008
coming
soon
drinkability
is
ok
the
balance
isnt
too
bad
for
the
style
but
otherwise
theres
nothing
bringing
me
back
for
more
dont
really
have
much
interest
in
finishing
the
glass
let
alone
considering
another
pours
an
almost
clear
light
ambergolden
some
orange
highlighting
very
thick
off
white
head
forms
chunky
and
rocky
drops
a
ton
of
lace
on
the
glass
very
thick
real
nice
layer
looks
good
smell
is
interesting
quite
sweet
lots
of
toffee
very
heavy
biscuity
aroma
bread
some
raisin
and
light
fruitiness
grapes
touch
of
alcohol
lightly
earthy
something
about
it
that
smells
a
bit
weird
i
cant
place
like
a
dirty
bathroom
floor
taste
is
weird
apricots
and
rotten
fruit
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
grapes
raisin
biscuits
very
sweet
some
iron
alcohol
kind
of
a
mess
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
almost
syrupy
low
carbonation
some
warmth
going
down
a
little
tough
of
drink
the
biscuittoasty
character
is
neat
but
too
sweet
and
some
real
strange
flavours
going
on
but
it
does
look
nice
thanks
greg
a
good
brew
works
well
with
a
grilled
swiss
cheese
sandwich
worth
the
taste
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
a
solid
craft
brew
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
its
different
i
will
give
it
that
a
bit
too
thick
in
the
mouth
not
a
big
hit
here
maybe
better
super
fresh
maybe
theres
more
hop
flavor
to
it
on
tap
id
expect
more
carbonation
too
to
help
cut
down
on
the
body
overall
interesting
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
is
a
strange
brew
im
not
sure
i
would
call
this
an
old
ale
exactly
but
it
is
interesting
big
and
adventurous
but
it
seems
to
miss
its
target
a
good
one
to
try
if
youre
into
new
offcenter
brews
but
its
a
stretch
to
say
this
is
like
any
other
old
ale
ive
ever
had
cheers
to
independence
for
being
creative
though
m
d
medium
body
medium
carbonation
pretty
straight
forward
maybe
even
lacking
a
little
something
this
likely
peaked
a
little
while
back
but
it
has
managed
to
hold
up
alright
no
real
desire
to
hunt
it
down
again
but
not
too
bad
glad
i
tried
it
i
saw
this
for
about
5
a
bomber
i
thought
that
was
a
good
deal
and
something
i
wanted
to
try
i
have
and
i
dont
care
to
try
it
again
the
flavor
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
tastes
of
syrupy
booze
white
pepper
tropical
fruit
esthers
and
a
kiss
of
piney
hops
along
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
with
a
low
carbonation
level
and
a
lingering
finish
of
warming
alcohol
jasperilla
isnt
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
an
old
ale
but
its
a
decent
brew
thats
worth
the
small
asking
price
nevertheless
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
intence
beer
and
nice
to
try
but
not
easy
to
drink
much
of
reminds
me
of
a
flat
whiskey
dr
pepper
or
a
mildlysweet
slightly
hopped
tawny
port
not
as
thick
or
sweet
or
alcoholic
as
north
coast
old
stock
but
closer
in
all
three
than
many
old
ales
ive
sampled
allinall
i
dont
really
like
it
its
annoyingly
cloyingly
sweet
and
never
amounted
to
my
notion
of
tasty
engaging
or
drinkable
a
bit
too
much
grapefruit
but
it
comes
together
decently
well
any
reasonable
beer
lover
would
think
that
a
9
3
old
ale
is
a
prime
candidate
for
aging
well
apparently
not
this
9
3
old
ale
i
hope
the
boys
at
independence
brewing
co
arent
satisfied
with
the
status
quo
because
jasperilla
has
a
great
deal
of
potential
thanks
to
mhewes
for
an
interesting
extra
very
smoothe
low
carbo
best
beer
by
independence
brewery
by
far
this
one
is
just
hard
to
nail
down
i
find
that
it
best
when
severed
at
a
bar
because
several
bottles
have
been
misses
that
i
picked
up
at
stores
in
the
end
i
think
it
is
worth
trying
but
not
something
you
are
going
to
want
all
the
time
you
might
want
to
avoid
the
2006
vintage
d
not
good
at
all
alcohol
is
not
in
the
taste
but
the
thick
sweetness
makes
it
not
so
quaffable
ill
have
a
hard
time
finishing
this
bomber
pleasurably
d
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
it
is
very
enjoyable
i
think
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
d
if
i
didnt
have
to
work
the
next
day
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
aftertaste
is
also
a
disappointing
synthetic
experience
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
the
clear
dark
amber
brew
head
lasts
well
with
heavy
coating
lace
aroma
is
strongly
sweet
but
also
has
some
citrus
and
pine
taste
is
lightly
malty
upfront
but
strongly
citrus
and
fruity
in
the
middle
with
a
light
hoppiness
next
and
then
a
warming
close
the
sharp
citrus
character
is
reminiscent
of
lemonade
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
just
alright
as
well
quashed
by
that
citrus
as
well
this
one
fell
apart
a
bit
once
i
got
past
the
eyes
and
nose
i
bought
this
bottle
at
central
market
in
austin
texas
this
beer
is
best
forgotten
hopefully
independence
can
do
better
in
the
future
pours
out
a
copper
amber
with
abundant
carbonation
and
a
nice
small
but
sturdy
head
leaves
some
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
tart
plum
and
granny
smith
lots
of
sherry
and
booze
too
is
this
already
showing
signs
of
heavy
oxidation
lots
of
plum
up
front
in
the
flavor
with
a
middle
showing
of
sour
apple
toast
starts
to
blossom
towards
the
end
but
is
interrupted
by
sherry
and
an
odd
fungalbakers
yeast
flavor
and
dryness
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
rather
mellow
and
a
touch
creamy
the
body
isnt
too
thick
but
holds
strong
not
impressed
with
this
at
all
not
finishing
this
bomber
pours
a
clear
bronze
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
that
dies
quick
and
leaves
behind
spotty
lace
smells
very
bready
caramel
sweet
malt
and
almost
a
hint
of
banana
chip
taste
is
big
on
malt
then
big
on
booze
finish
is
sherry
like
full
in
the
mouth
with
minor
carbonation
had
to
choke
the
end
of
this
down
way
too
boozy
jasperilla
old
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
body
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
offwhite
foam
the
head
retention
is
limited
and
it
leaves
little
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
fruity
with
yeast
character
apple
pear
red
berries
but
it
has
some
higher
alcohols
and
a
touch
of
acetone
as
well
that
carries
over
into
the
flavor
and
seems
to
dominate
its
like
drinking
a
hot
honeymead
perhaps
the
fermentation
just
got
away
on
this
batch
the
cooling
system
failed
or
something
but
its
not
good
as
it
warms
and
the
maltiness
comes
out
a
bit
more
its
a
little
easier
to
take
but
at
that
point
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevalent
flawed
perhaps
next
years
will
be
better
a
dark
rich
amber
colour
in
the
glass
no
head
but
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
fairly
strong
aromas
particularly
as
it
warmed
of
bread
and
dried
fruit
similar
to
a
christmas
fruit
cake
the
higher
alcohol
often
typical
of
the
style
is
detectable
but
light
full
rich
flavours
of
caramel
and
dark
fruits
raisins
figs
apricots
vanilla
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
a
bit
acidic
with
a
mild
warming
affect
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
with
a
desert
as
well
as
savoured
as
an
evening
ender
very
drinkable
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
is
what
id
call
a
stealth
beer
very
easy
to
drink
quickly
for
such
a
high
gravity
itll
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
matures
over
time
i
bought
this
2005
vintage
at
grapevine
market
austin
texas
in
april
2007
first
do
not
drink
it
too
cold
let
it

22
ozs
of
joy
dont
plan
another
brew
on
the
same
day
sampled
at
independence
brewing
on
saturday
october
14th
2006
it
redefines
the
old
ale
category
o
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
the
2013
is
drinking
really
well
pours
a
burnt
caramel
color
with
an
average
head
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
no
legs
what
so
ever
in
fact
ive
never
seen
a
beer
that
stuck
to
the
glass
quite
like
this
smells
of
honey
and
oats
taste
is
very
rich
but
mellow
with
the
high
abv
this
is
definitely
at
the
top
of
my
ales
list
overall
a
really
excellent
beer
one
of
the
rare
barley
winesold
ales
made
in
the
us
that
can
compete
with
the
english
classics
overall
complex
aroma
and
flavvors
this
is
an
amazing
beer
o
5
one
of
the
absolute
best
representations
of
the
old
ale
style
ive
had
and
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
in
a
long
time
for
fans
of
these
two
beers
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
delicious
hybrid
mixture
of
founders
curmudgeon
and
backwood
bastard
a
5
star
beer
highly
recommended
to
stock
up
on
and
cellar
for
a
special
occasion
says
review
is
optional
it
is
not
not
a
huge
fan
of
old
ales
but
this
has
to
be
one
if
the
best
examples
of
the
style
2015
vintage
smooth
and
sweet
straight
sipper
and
much
better
as
it
warms
id
like
to
get
ahold
of
an
aged
vintage
and
see
how
it
changes
over
time
i
always
look
forward
to
the
release
of
this
awesome
old
ale
and
the
2015
version
did
not
disappoint
this
years
has
more
of
a
molassesbourbon
smell
leading
to
a
toffeeraisin
taste
with
that
always
wonderful
warm
banana
bread
finish
i
will
be
buying
as
much
of
this
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
will
only
get
better
with
age
o
an
excellent
take
on
the
easily
obtainable
old
ale
unfortunately
i
think
this
style
is
lost
and
i
love
how
north
coast
is
continuing
to
make
this
extraordinary
compared
to
the
2015
version
this
is
incredibly
different
but
in
a
good
way
will
probably
pick
up
another
bottle
and
allow
it
to
age
for
longer
nc
really
got
it
right
with
this
one
nice
old
ale
ill
be
sitting
the
rest
down
for
a
few
years
though
to
see
how
it
does
i
was
expecting
more
i
would
lean
to
buying

2014
variety
dark
brown
and
clear
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
aroma
but
there
was
a
bit
of
sugariness
caramel
and
vanilla
is
prominent
a
little
sour
at
11
8abv
its
masked
well
must
serve
this
at
proper
temp
or
else
its
just
not
the
same
hearty
ale
with
some
alcohol
bite
to
it
nice
flavor
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
bursts
with
flavor
early
on
especially
bourbon
and
vanilla
as
well
as
dark
fruits
and
a
balanced
sweetness
it
brings
to
mind
backwoods
bastard
in
the
prominence
of
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
as
it
warmed
and
especially
towards
the
end
it
evolves
into
sherry
flavors
and
a
tartness
the
higher
abv
is
noticeable
but
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
i
intend
to
stock
up
on
a
number
of
4
packs
just
did
a
vertical
of
the
2010
2013
and
2014
2010
was
more
fruit
and
plumb
flavor
2013
was
a
nice
balance
of
malt
fruit
and
hop
and
2014
was
more
brash
and
hop
flavor
a
nice
ale
regardless
of
the
year
had
this
on
20150206
in
paoli
pa
poured
an
amber
brown
with
a
relatively
thick
head
that
receded
to
a
ring
nothing
particularly
interesting
to
look
at
smell
was
really
nice
faint
but
a
burnt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
type
aroma
taste
was
a
bit
too
rich
for
me
aroma
amplified
quite
a
bit
the
feel
was
excellent
actually
felt
the
carbonation
for
quite
a
while
even
though
there
were
no
real
visible
signs
of
any
nice
and
thick
low
drinkability
though
and
i
felt
that
the
beer
flattened
out
maybe
half
an
hour
halfway
thru
it
overall
its
a
good
beer
i
think
it
would
be
perfect
candidate
to
cellar
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
evolves
over
time
may
have
liked
it
more
if
i
liked
the
slight
coffee
flavor
of
which
i
am
not
fond
the
one
i
had
was
2014
feel
silky
alcohol
well
hidden
beware
o
a
big
beer
that
drinks
like
one
the
great
malt
character
in
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
few
barley
wines
ive
had
i
would
be
interested
in
doing
a
side
by
side
with
a
fresh
vs
aged
2yr
to
see
how
this
develops
i
have
a
feeling
id
like
the
aged
more
great
beer
wonderful
winter
supper
m
medium
carbonation
full
bodied
sweet
finish
but
still
pretty
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
too
great
carmelmalt
profile
balanced
by
a
subtle
alcohol
heat
and
earthy
bitterness
a
great
sipper
on
a
cool
dark
evening
overall
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
i
need
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
a
top
tier
ale
the
balance
between
abv
and
drinkability
is
fantastic
for
an
ale
marketing
is
a
little
weak
for
how
good
the
beer
is
worth
looking
into
for
the
brewery
fantastic
beer
o
great
old
ale
im
sure
more
time
would
mellow
this
out
some
thick
caramely
maple
goodness
just
a
hint
of
heat
very
good
stuff
overall
unapologetically
boozy
big
and
complex
malts
make
a
nice
sipper
o
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
delicious
for
me
i
like
old
ales
and
for
11
8
the
booze
isnt
overwhelming
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
as
most
old
ales
tend
to
be
but
the
nice
fruity
characteristics
mixed
with
the
slightly
bitter
finish
really
help
balance
it
out
i
bought
a
few
of
these
to
cellar
after
tasting
how
good
this
can
be
with
a
few
years
on
it
so
i
am
drinking
this
fresh
and
will
try
it
again
in
a
year
to
see
how
it
evolves
2014
vintage
too
boozy
though
would
like
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
great
find
for
a
cold
ohio
night
very
smooth
with
a
nice
kick
this
is
a
beer
for
cold
winter
days
smooth
taste
good
aroma
for
a
higher
beer
extremely
exceptional
and
far
beyond
my
expectations
gonna
grab
one
tomorrow
to
age
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
literally
not
figuratively
i
didnt
like
it
poured
some
out
which
i
never
do
i
see
this
is
highly
rated
which
is
why
i
bought
it
but
the
emperor
has
no
clothes
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
2014
poured
a
gorgeous
burgundytinted
dark
amber
color
into
a
tulip
boozy
nose
has
one
of
the
most
complex
yet
inexplicably
balanced
tastes
of
any
beer
ive
ever
tried
malt
yeast
hops
fruit
they
all
seem
to
be
in
there
my
head
is
swimming
and
its
not
just
the
11
8
abv
this
beer
is
an
unabashed
treat
and
the
folks
at
north
coast
deserve
a
medal
or
at
least
people
lining
up
to
buy
it
i
could
believe
that
kind
of
hype
for
an
ale
like
this
old
stock
ale
2013
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
deep
amber
cider
color
slight
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
holds
a
compact
effervescent
carbonated
mouthfeel
very
well
throughout
the
duration
nose
is
sweet
sugar
dark
fruit
and
bread
taste
is
a
subtle
roving
complexity
burnt
sugar
raisin
fig
plum
and
toast
at
11

abv
there
is
a
gliding
ester
quality
and
warming
booze
tone
an
amazingly
balanced
sipper
enjoy
strong
this
felt
and
strong
this
was
but
that
didnt
detract
from
the
profile
or
drinkability
of
this
beer
the
yeast
and
fruit
flavors
lingered
beautifully
long
after
the
liquid
went
down
and
there
was
enough
malt
her
to
make
this
full
but
just
short
of
feeling
cloying
or
chewy
short
of
having
too
much
grain
or
rye
this
beer
nailed
what
an
old
ale
should
be
and
in
terms
of
quality
stands
toetotoe
with
the
old
rasputin
an
outstanding
offering
and
the
example
of
why
brewers
should
add
an
old
ale
to
their
portfolio

rarely
more

ill
be
sipping
this
one
for
hours
very
smooth
with
mild
dark
cherry
and
a
strong

finish
final
verdict
good
beer
would
be
better
aged
a
year
or
two
i
think
this
might
be
the
oldest
beer
ive
ever
drank
i
had
a
99
jw
lees
harvest
ale
back
in
2010
so
it
would
be
close
i
was
expecting
a
novelty
but
this
one
was
well
worth
drinking
now
i
want
to
find
other
vintages
thanks
again
phil
for
the
experience
even
with
two
years
of
age
on
this
bottle
north
coasts
old
stock
ale
was
quite
boozy
and
rough
around
the
edges
with
its
almost
cloying
sweetness
on
the
front
end
and
harsh
hoppy
and
boozy
notes
on
the
finish
this
drank
a
lot
like
an
old
school
west
coaststyle
barleywine
perhaps
a
bit
more
time
in
the
cellar
would
do
it
some
good
this
is
an
outstanding
old
ale
those
american
bastards
they
did
it
again
great
complexity
with
lots
of
vinous
dark
fruit
and
toffee
notes
nectar
from
heaven
this
beer
has
several
outstanding
qualities
but
the
spice
profile
is
not
my
best
friend
body
was
great
color
was
beautiful
something
in
the
finish
that
i
did
not
care
for
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
good
beer
overall
im
into
big
beers
like
this
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
2014
vintage
clear
heavy
amber
pour
with
a
huge
dark
ruby
cast
making
it
almost
red
good
head
lacing
and
retention
the
nose
is
dark
fruits
plum
raisin
and
fig
over
a
faint
caramel
sweetness
with
moderate
alcohol
notes
full
bodied
with
a
rich
creamy
texture
average
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
loaded
with
complexity
yet
well
balanced
the
11
8
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
becomes
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
caramel
sweetness
that
flows
into
the
dark
fruit
flavors
but
the
sweetness
is
never
absent
due
to
the
heavy
malt
bill
chocolate
notes
appear
in
the
middle
that
relent
to
coffeetoffee
notes
the
finish
is
where
the
alcohol
is
most
prevalent
leaving
you
with
that
nice
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
but
yet
not
overpowering
the
finish
is
somewhat
tannic
with
a
touch
of
hops
over
a
fading
caramel
sweetness
an
outstanding
old
ale
and
a
fine
example
of
ocs
brewing
prowess
i
suggest
this
beer
heavily

very
very

this

for

a
beer
drinkers
beer
the
kind
of
taste
one
thinks
of
when
desiring
a
good
beer
to
end
the
work
day
one
of
the
better
american
old
ales
in
the
market
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
many
of
the
other
american
old
ales
tend
to
be
too
sweet
and
end
up
tasting
more
like
milder
version
of
a
barleywine
this
one
was
balanced
my
recommendation
however
would
be
to
age
it

purchasing
for
a
year

follows

a
little
boozy
but
it
helps
to
enhance
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
getting
a
little
vanilla

too
maybe
a
hint
of
cherry
overall
very

thick

like
its
mellowed

with

it

as
it

overall
im
not
really
the
audience
for
this
beer
because
im
not
super
into
howitzergrade
alcohol
its
well
executed
and
oldstock
ale
fans
will
almost
certainly
enjoy
it
a
decent

but
not
something
that
motivates
me

lot
from
north
coast
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
its
a
little
hot
i
have
three
other
bottles
that
i
will
let
sit
another
year
then
we
will
see
if
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
a
bit
very
nice
beer
definitely
better
a
little
warm
than
right
out
of
the
fridge
very
good
i
am
going
to
try
2014
to
get
a
comparison
definitely
worth
a
try
o
overall
very
nice
old
ale
almost
a
barrelaged
booziness
that
gives
a
good
alcohol
presence
but
no
burn
very
nice
offering
2011
old
stock
ale
in
my
snifter
absolute
perfect
melding
of
aroma
taste
experience
such
a
different
vibe
very
deep
amber
hue
accented
by
a
strong
sweet
molasses
scent
tastes
like
a
liquid
dream
smoothest
mouthfeel
i
have
experienced
save
perhaps
fis
overall
a
winner
back
to
the
bottle
shop
for
a
few
more
to
age
mo
a
little
bland
and
generic
oversmooth
im
sure
its
delicious
and
id
like
to
try
it
again
o
its
subtle
its
sweet
and
its
good
overall
man
oh
man
where
has
this
been
all
my
life
im
in
love
drinks
like
a
ba
barleywine
without
all
the
strong
bourbon
punch
this
is
one
ill
be
revisiting
in
the
near
future
granted
i
can
find
it
overall
very
underwhelmed
this
is
the
2013
vintage
likely
aged
around
a
year
and
the
flavor
nor
mouthfeel
are
on
par
with
my
favorites
in
the
style
not
much
balance
to
it
other
than
caramel
very
little
dark
fruit
and
booze
i
recently
had
bells
third
coast
old
ale
and
that
blew
this
away
in
my
opinion
wont
be
returning
any
time
soon
poured
from
a
large
bottle
into
a
paper
cup
poolside
after
a
long
motorcycle
ride
three
years
old2011
brew
sampled
in
2014
brownamber
color
thick
frothy
head
cant
judge
lacing
in
a
paper
cup
aroma
is
unique
sweet
brandy
caramel
malt
and
a
fairly
strong
aroma
of
alcohol
flavor
is
amazingbrandy
caramel
molasses
sweetnessslight
hops
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
outstanding
ale
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
barleywine
feel
but
not
quite
definitely
has
a
nice
cellar
feel
to
it
this
is
tasty
to
the
extreme
very
characterful
brew
love
the
contrast
of
sweet
and
tart
tones
and
the
underlying
dark
fruit
adds
nice
complexity
still
a
bit
hot
this
should
age
well
the
finish
is
just
a
touch
flat
overall
for
12
abv
i
only
get
some
heat
way
way
at
the
end
very
excellent
brew
i
know
i
should
age
some
but
this
is
really
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
had
and
i
dont
know
if
i
have
the
will
power
such
a
balanced
flavor
would
pair
excellent
with
anything
on
the
grill
or
smoker
overall
maybe
im
just
not
an
old
ale
guy
but
this
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
but
ive
got
another
three
bottles
so
ill
get
a
chance
to
try
this
a
bit
further
down
the
line
and
see
if
the
beer
or
my
palate
improves
o
the
abv
is
expertly
masked
this
beer
already
has
a
rich
flavour
profile
so
ill
be
interested
to
see
how
it
drinks
with
a
few
more
years
on
it
hopefully
it
takes
on
new
layers
of
complexity
a
great
beer
to
round
out
a
great
session
just
needs
a
little
more
depth
and
complexity
which
should
come
with
age
overall
a
great
old
ale
cant
wait
to
cellar
one
of
these
for
a
bit
and
also
looking
forward
to
trying
the
2011
vintage
ive
been
eyeing
what
makes
this
beer
so
great
is
that
is
just
so
incredibly
drinkable
not
in
the
least
bit
overpowering
and
yet
so
flavorful
overall
old
ale
is
s
style
i
have
only
had
a
few
of
but
when
i
do
they
shine
this
was
delicious
wow
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
not
sure
how
much
it
differs
year
to
year
but
i
cant
wait
to
find
out
its
big
bold
sweet
toasty
and
boozy
sip
with
caution
not
for
the
timid
o
fantastic
old
ale
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
perfection
great
beer
that
i
often
overlook
but
shouldnt
since
it
is
that
good
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
if
one
approaches
this
from
the
standpoint
that
old
ale
means
theakstons
old
peculier
one
will
leave
disappointed
thats
a
fantastic
brew
in
and
of
itself
but
a
flier
in
regards
to
style
with
the
treacle
flavors
and
lower
abv
this
one
is
more
in
range
style
wise
fruity
wine
like
strong
without
being
boozy
with
a
fantastic
maltiness
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
and
would
definitely
be
a
candidate
for
laying
down
for
a
year
or
three
the
beer
i
mean
although
youll
lay
down
after
two
or
three
as
well
i
could
definitely
see
this
pairing
with
a
relatively
strong
aged
cheese
or
a
fruit
dessert
that
had
some
tartness
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
worth
seeking
out
not
a
fan
high
alcohol
content
which
is
not
incorporated
well
into
the
overall
taste
o
i
like
this
beer
despite
my
skepticism
with
the
first
sip
the
beer
was
overly
chilled
when
i
first
drank
it
thereby
masking
the
wonderful
smells
and
tastes
let
this
beer
age
chill
it
sip
it
as
it
warms
and
let
the
complexity
wash
over
your
taste
buds
anxious
to
try
another
bottle
next
year
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
doppelbock
qualities
that
are
unwelcome
in
an
old
ale
i
also
feel
like
a
beer
of
this
high
abv
should
have
a
body
and
complexity
to
it
that
this
beer
falls
short
of
this
beer
really
cant
justify
the
drunk
it
will
make
me
that
metallic
flavor
keeps
coming
back
every
sip
to
haunt
me
maybe
i
have
a
bottle
that
was
inappropriately
stored
on
its
side
either
way
it
would
probably
be
better
to
seek
out
a
different
vintage
something
about
this
beer
tastes
wrong
to
me
dont
try
the
2013
vintage
seek
out
a
different
one
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
an
interesting
contrast
to
the
bigfoots
ive
been
drinking
lately
theres
a
lot
of
citrus
on
this
almost
to
the
point
it
reminds
me
of
what
youd
find
inside
of
a
chocolate
i
enjoy
it
though
as
four
packs
are
around
12
i
plan
to
cellar
the
rest
for
future
years
and
verticals
overall
i
was
really
hoping
this
would
be
an
awesome
experience
with
this
beer
having
so
much
age
but
it
is
just
too
sweet
a
bit
one
dimensional
as
well
i
may
need
to
seek
out
a
fresh
example
sometime
enjoy
with
apple
cinnamon
stuffed

2013
bottle
from
tipples
pours
dark
amber
red
colored
with
a
one
finger
yellowish
tannish
head
aroma
of
sweet
dark
fruits
leather
caramel
some
aroma
that
gives
this
a
lager
like
smell
flavor
follows
with
sweet
fruits
plums
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
sweet
finish
that
reminds
me
of
a
bock
this
is
interesting
and
doesnt
scream
barleywine
or
old
ale
to
me
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
with
medium
low
carbonation
some
alcohol
warmth
going
down
that
makes
this
a
nice
winter
warmer
not
what
i
expected
after
trying
the
cellar
reserve
version
metallic
finish
o
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
very
complex
and
satisfying
a
perfect
beer
for
collaring
mf
mediumbody
semidry
finish
a
wee
bit
slick
warming
smooth
with
a
bit
of
cream
in
the
finish
as
well
there
is
some
alcohol
that
lasts
on
the
palate
4
5
o
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
its
like
a
hopped
up
double
brown
ale
it
has
a
good
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
they
didnt
over
power
the
malty
tones
with
a
lot
of
late
hop
additions
so
the
very
last
thing
you
taste
on
the
palate
is
a
biscuit
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
im
a
fan
pours
a
nice
dark
goldbrown
i
taste
sweet
molasses
toffee
vanilla
oak
and
some
alcohol
it
was
very
similar
to
a
backwoods
bastard
but
a
little
more
intense
and
chaotic
in
a
good
way
this
is
definitely
worth
cellaring
i
will
from
now
on
buy
a
case
of
this
every
year
and
hopefully
5
years
down
the
road
do
a
vertical
with
this
one
o
an
excellent
strong
ale
if
you
like
malty
beers
you
will
love
this
one
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
surprised
with
the
rich
deep
mahogany
colors
the
fullness
in
smell
and
taste
and
a
twist
on
feel
o
this
seems
like
a
classic
and
complex
beer
that
really
needs
some
age
on
it
to
be
fully
appreciated
will
probably
try
the
2013
then
hold
on
to
the
other
two
bottles
i
have
for
6
months
to
a
year
to
see
what
happens
certainly
i
would
advise
others
to
check
this
out
o
this
is
always
worth
buying
because
it
never
disappoints
ive
had
it
for
three
different
years
and
all
of
them
are
amazing
great
beer
2013
version
rusty
brown
pour
little
head
malt
sweetness
aroma
with
darker
fruits
taste
has
the
dark
fruits
more
pronounced
with
some
bitter
sweetness
at
the
end
very
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
a
little
metallic
tinge
in
the
taste
but
not
overpowering
or
totally
disturbing
just
a
product
of
the
abv
i
think
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
but
not
really
a
flaw
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
have
the
2011
waiting
also
o
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
if
you
like
scotch
ales
or
dopplebocks
you
will
certainly
enjoy
this
one
rushed
directly
to
my
supplier
and
ordered
a
case
after
having
tasted
my
first
overall
pretty
good
a
cross
between
barleywine
and
old
ale
aged
malts
are
lighter
but
nice
good
candy
with
toffee
and
butterscotch
caramel
etc
booze
is
held
in
check
and
balanced
decently
by
the
sweetness
but
not
overly
sweet
and
there
is
enough
booze
warmth
to
be
a
good
strong
old
ale
tasty
and
enjoyable
sipper
for
the
cold
night
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
great
one
to
try
if
you
are
new
to
old
ales
as
i
am
this
beer
seems
true
to
styling
characteristics
this
beer
ages
very
well
even
10
years
or
more
from
all
of
my
information
i
want
another
one
this
year
and
at
least
once
a
year
from
previous
years
o
i
love
old
ale
and
americanenglish
barleywines
and
this
beer
is
more
of
an
english
barleywine
with
slightly
more
bitter
hops
on
the
aftertaste
sweet
but
not
sickeningly
so
high
abv
but
not
overpowering
though
you
can
feel
it
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
these
types
of
beers
america
has
to
offer
foghorn
third
coast
old
ale
and
bigfoot
hope
to
try
to
barrel
aged
version
someday
a
bit
too
much
on
the
alcohol
bitterness
and
sweet
balance
is
decent
but
still
too
boozy
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
the
best
old
ale
i
have
ever
come
across
its
better
than
old
stock
cellar
reserve
too
which
was
too
thin
and
tasted
primarily
of
butterscotch
vintage
2013
brew
pours
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
2finger
beige
foamy
head
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
very
powerful
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
molasses
alcohol
malts
and
bourbon
lots
going
on
here
the
taste
was
actually
very
pleasant
and
the
high
alcohol
content
didnt
over
power
the
flavor
here
is
another
complex
taste
perfect
carbonation
you
arent
going
to
drink
many
of
these
at
all
per
seating
overall
really
nice
overall
having
this
beer
a
day
apart
from
the
winter
old
ale
from
alaskan
is
like
night
and
day
i
was
thinking
my
rating
on
the
alaskan
was
maybe
too
harsh
but
im
not
second
guessing
anymore
this
is
what
an
old
ale
should
be
one
of
my
favorite
and
in
my
top
5
for
the
style
for
sure
edit
as
of
11215
still
drinking
my
2012
bottles
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
age
it
just
keeps
getting
smoother
and
more
satisfying
as
it
gets
older
get
yourself
some
already
aged
version
and
enjoy
drinkability
pretty
much
a
must
try
must
cellar
one
of
a
kind
up
there
with
other
ancients
like
belgians
or
duchess
of
burgundy
but
really
i
think
this
is
as
enjoyable
try
this
instead
of
a
brandy
or
whiskey
this
has
been
my
first
introduction
to
the
old
stock
style
and
i
definitely
would
like
to
find
more
because
this
drink
was
amazing
o
4
25
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
comparable
to
bells
third
coast
old
ale
or
freudian
sip
of
course
the
old
ale
that
took
the
cake
for
me
was
double
dba
but
that
beer
is
in
a
league
all
its
own
this
beer
is
an
enigma
the
aroma
is
wonderfully
nuanced
and
complex
while
the
flavor
is
heavyhanded
and
unremarkable
the
taste
is
bold
and
boozy
yet
the
body
is
thin
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brew
but
it
contradicts
itself
on
several
fronts
and
ultimately
leaves
me
disappointed
post
script
i
found
two
more
bottles
the
next
day
and
will
hold
for
some
additional
aging
if
my
will
power
will
allow
o
easy
drinking
enough
for
the
very
high
abv
which
is
to
say
not
awfully
easy
drinking
the
taste
is
somewhere
along
the
lines
of
a
barleywine
personally
i
prefer
old
ale
to
be
more
malt
dominant
but
if
you
want
a
powerful
brew
you
could
do
worse
o
this
is
a
complex
and
very
unique
brew
i
purchased
two
with
the
intent
of
aging
one
but
i
will
go
back
to
get
a
few
more
years
worth
of
reviewing
o
for
some
reason
the
2013
isnt
as
enjoyable
as
the
previous
two
vintages
for
my
palate
still
wellmade
and
worth
a
try
overall
an
incredible
domestic
example
of
the
style
that
is
true
to
its
description
and
forgoes
a
hopinfused
americanization
for
an
authentic
deep
rich
malt
celebration
for
such
an
easytofind
widelyavailable
beer
this
stuff
is
a
treasure
im
sure
more
time
in
the
cellar
will
only
make
it
better
highly
recommended
for
me
the
quintessential
old
ale
the
best
beer
made
by
these
guys
that
i
have
tried
this
is
a
very
nicely
brewed
beer
a
little
more
eyecatching
label
would
push
this
to
the
worldclass
category
overall
north
coast
delivers
another
exceptional
brew
with
old
stock
ale
while
not
something
i
would
seek
out
constantly
you
can
bet
ill
have
some
around
for
special
occasions
well
done
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
with
its
fullness
and
sweetness
shouldve
held
onto
this
for
a
while
but
i
guess
im
lucky
in
a
sense
being
in
australia
where
this
just
sits
around
while
ipas
fly
off
the
shelves
the
last
of
my
4
pack
and
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
another
o
spectacular
im
going
to
get
a
few
of
these
and
cellar
them
and
see
what
happens
im
very
glad
that
i
pull
up
ba
on
my
phone
whenever
im
in
the
liquor
store
overall
a
good
well
done
version
that
seems
to
be
fairly
easy
to
get
your
hands
on
definitely
to
snatch
some
up
and
cellar
or
drink
some
great
gateway
into
a
style
that
is
just
unbeatable
to
me
o
this
was
very
interesting
and
completely
new
to
me
unlike
most
beers
i
have
had
before
it
is
very
good
though
overallgreat
smell
and
appearance
well
done
north
coast
skol
o
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
definitely
a
lost
style
that
very
few
breweries
are
making
well
these
days
i
have
had
the
2010
2011
and
2012
versions
and
each
is
subtilely
different
this
beer
can
really
benefit
from
cellar
aging
in
the
bottle
to
let
the
flavors
mellow
and
come
together
it
only
gets
better
with
time
what
can
i
say
this
ale
is
pleasant
as
hell
if
hell
were
really
really
pleasant
interesting
as
i
disect
this
beer
piece
by
piece
wouldnt
say
im
wowed
by
the
isolated
elements
still
this
is
one
brew
for
which
when
all
the
pieces
are
put
together
the
total
package
offers
much
to
enjoy
o
strong
but
quite
drinkable
very
well
done
my
second
north
coast
after
old
rasputin
no
regret
just
pleasure
o
a
nice
old
ale
will
have
to
try
this
again
sometime
overall
a
very
good
american
old
ale
that
i
would
definetly
buy
again
especially
at
2
bucks
a
piece
overall
i
really
enoy
this
beer
great
sipper
to
enjoy
with
a
lot
of
complexity
the
only
old
ales
ive
had
before
are
this
2012
vintage
and
founders
old
curmudgeonsp
but
i
am
really
into
this
style
need
to
find
some
more
examples
i
am
looking
forward
to
doing
a
side
by
side
with
this
and
one
of
the
2012s
i
have
in
my
cellar
to
see
how
its
aged
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
a
beer
designed
for
aging
and
i
will
revisit
my
2012
stash
in
a
couple
years
to
see
how
it
is
coming
along
but
for
right
now
there
is
just
too
much
going
on
its
like
an
untamed
and
out
of
control
teenager
who
has
an
awful
lot
of
potential
but
just
need
to
mature
for
a
few
more
years
before
it
is
realized
with
that
said
after
the
first
few
sips
it
did
begin
to
mellow
out
and
become
more
drinkable
but
at
first
i
was
not
sure
i
would
be
able
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
amber
with
a
fair
foamy
head
and
a
little
lacing
nose
is
sweet
combination
of
maple
and
molasses
flavor
is
peaty
bitter
and
burning
no
sweet
offset
as
the
nose
portends
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
slick
body
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
final
thoughts
north
coast
old
stock
ale
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
its
hot
and
brash
and
will
fight
your
palate
with
everything
its
got
but
yet
somehow
leaves
you
feeling
completely
calm
and
satisfied
what
a
great
beer
highly
recommended
for
enjoyers
of
old
ales
american
strong
ales
barleywines
scottish
ales
and
even
dipas
would
i
drink
it
again
hell
yes
and
if
a
barrel
aged
version
is
available
consider
me
iso
rusty

edition
bottle
poured
in
a
snifter
upon
opening
the
bottle
i
get
huge
aromas
of
whiskey
it
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
body
with
a
quality
head
it
smells
of
boozewhiskey
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
caramel
malts
and
toffee
this
is
a
pretty
heady
old
ale
lots
of
complex
dark
fruits
blend
with
a
caramel
sweetness
its
followed
by
a
sweet
toffee
flavor
and
a
warm
boozy
finish
this
seems
like
a
perfect
candidate
for
the
cellar
although
its
drinking
fine
right
now
incredible
execution
of
an
old
ale
that
will
undoubtedly
become
even
more
stupendous
with
age
overall
an
awesome
beer
that
can
do
damage
must
be
respected
and
not
for
a
novice
a
great
beer
to
begin
an
epic
night
with
this
beer
is
a
winner
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
it
and
im
extremely
glad
i
revisited
it
recommended
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
to
me
its
a
great
example
of
what
a
cellared
beer
should
be
with
that
being
said
not
sure
if
id
let
my
other
bottle
go
more
than
another
year
o
a
solid
old
ale
with
smooth
flavor
a
few
of
these
could
leave
one
striving
to
remember
their
evening
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
slightly
boozy
brew
the
only
thing
really
holding
it
back
from
greatness
is
the
weak
body
but
otherwise
it
is
quite
fantastic
o
a
nice
old
ale
i
need
to
revist
one
that
has
been
aged
for
a
while
i
think
this
will
cellar
well
o
this
one
will
age
nicely
but
its
some
good
drinkin
right
now
too
its
sweet
without
being
cloying
its
malty
but
surprisingly
balanced
and
mellow
the
booze
bite
is
present
but
it
adds
to
the
beer
rather
than
being
a
negative
overall
this
is
an
impressive
old
ale
ill
gladly
age
these
to
see
how
they
mature
over
time
golden
amber
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
smells
sweet
with
caramel
booziness
almost
smells
bourbon
aged
even
though
i
dont
think
it
is
smooth
taste
wow
caramel
from
the
nose
is
heavy
up
front
on
taste
hops
are
very
subdued
but
provide
some
balance
alcohol
is
hidden
very
very
well
coats
the
mouth
nicely
overall
a
pretty
well
balanced
ale
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
d
not
the
most
complex
old
ale
but
very
nice
around
1
52
years
old
taste
sweet
no
hop
freshness
and
only
a
mild
bitterness
remains
after
2
years
out
the
beer
still
retains
a
pleasing
effervescence
theres
thick
caramel
notes
on
the
slightly
tannic
finish
warms
unevenly
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
booziness
evident
after
just
15
minutes
felt
like
work
to
finish
the
rest
of
the
bottle
slightly
prickly
carbonation
and
a
bigger
smooth
body
o
not
good
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
beer
aging
done
correctly
i
picked
up
this
bottle
from
a
local
shop
that
had
its
annual
cellar
sale
and
i
am
really
glad
i
got
a
bottle
of
this
to
try
any
fusel
elements
from
the
alcohol
have
mellowed
nicely
with
age
and
the
flavors
have
melded
together
well
while
the
carbonation
hasnt
dissipated
excessively
a
very
tasty
example
of
the
style
that
would
likely
stand
up
to
another
4
years
of
aging
o
better
than
i
expected
its
actually
pretty
damn
drinkable
right
now
if
the
mouthfeel
was
beefed
up
some
this
really
could
have
been
something
unbelievable
as
it
stands
its
still
an
excellent
old
ale
seemingly
lacking
in
frills
it
instead
chooses
to
sneak
up
on
the
palate
with
a
wonderful
if
not
readily
apparent
at
first
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
wish
i
bought
more
than
a
single
overall
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
with
in
this
style
but
this
would
definitly
be
towards
the
top
for
what
ive
had
it
has
some
barleywine
aspects
to
it
and
is
a
nice
choice
as
a
winter
seasonal
o
every
time
i
try
this
beer
im
impressed
its
so
flavorful
packs
a
punch
and
smells
great
this
beer
is
visually
appealing
and
even
better
to
drink
or
sip
but
really
great
overall
definitely
a
must
have
thumbs
up
for
north
coast
o
love
old
ales
and
this
brew
is
no
exception
simply
fantastic
o
a
smooth
caramel
and
malty
beer
that
doesnt
get
too
sweet
this
beer
has
mellowed
nicely
over
the
years
and
is
a
real
treat
ill
have
to
lay
down
a
few
more
o
a
malt
balance
and
melds
together
well
surprisingly
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
and
i
cannot
wait
to
try
the
other
three
that
i
put
away
for
some
aging
so
all
in
all
im
intrigued
by
how
interestingly
outthere
this
old
ale
is
but
i
would
not
drop
this
kind
of
dough
on
it
again
high
ratings
for
delivering
something
new
thats
more
up
my
alley
than
most
beers
but
it
could
have
been
higher
if
it
had
been
more
practical
overall
definitely
a
sipper
lots
of
complex
flavors
in
this
beer
that
could
convert
any
wine
drinker
if
you
ask
me
a
bit
sweet
and
certainly
boozy
so
i
dont
think
i
could
take
down
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
d
great
candidate
for
aging
though
im
not
sure
this
would
stand
the
test
of
5
years
o
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
few
months
smooth
thick
warm
gonna
have
to
try
and
pick
up
another
4
pack
somewhere
o
i
was
expecting
good
things
from
this
and
was
left
very
disappointed
overall
i
dont
really
think
its
fair
to
open
this
beer
fresh
from
the
store
and
automatically
start
bashing
it
because
it
says
right
on
the
packaging
that
it
was
brewed
with
the
intention
to
be
layed
down
for
at
least
a
year
before
drinking
it
is
pretty
hot
but
im
really
excited
to
see
what
this
beer
turns
into
after
some
adequate
aging
at
first
the
boozines
was
a
bit
over
the
top
for
me
but
i
started
enjoying
it
more
as
it
went
along
its
not
my
favorite
north
coast
beer
but
its
a
good
one
and
a
good
representation
of
its
style
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
complex
vintage
of
north
coast
brewerys
old
stock
ale
its
certainly
a
sipping
beer
that
gives
you
a
little
something
with
every
sip
this
has
so
much
booze
too
much
booze
i
understand
that
this
was
the
intention
but
im
not
really
a
big
fan
its
definitely
drinkable
as
a
sipper
but
its
really
harsh
maybe
this
needs
to
sit
for
years
or
maybe
2012
was
just
a
bad
year
either
way
borderline
drain
pour
o
ive
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
and
finally
got
my
chance
if
youre
craving
a
full
flavored
beer
with
malty
syrupy
sweetness
this
will
hit
the
spot
now
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
it
all
on
my
own
a
very
nice
beer
i
dont
really
understand
the
style
guidelines
and
why
this
is
an
old
ale
and
not
an
english
barleywine
but
regardless
i
like
it
very
malty
very
robust
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
could
have
several
of
these
though
my
body
wouldnt
thank
me
for
it
d
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
would
be
better
to
sip
one
slowly
o
fantastic
i
love
old
ales
and
while
founders
curmudgeon
may
be
the
pinnacle
for
me
this
isnt
all
that
far
behind
loved
the
smell
loved
the
look
loved
the
feel
just
a
little
too
much
alcohol
for
me
if
you
like
high
amounts
of
alcohol
flavor
this
is
for
you
i
like
my
high
percentage
beers
to
be
sneaker
not
so
much
of
a
wine
taste
to
them
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
the
flavor
wasnt
to
my
taste
but
everything
else
was
great
i
recently
found
the
rest
of
this
six
pack
2002
vintage
there
was
still
the
meager
carbonation
but
none
of
sweetness
or
thickness
that
it
had
before
im
quite
frankly
amazed
that
this
beer
is
still
so
good
10
years
later
other
more
potent
beers
have
gone
bad
but
not
this
one
well
at
least
i
dont
think
this
one
went
bad
if
i
dont
return
tell
my
wife
to
bury
me
with
all
my
stuff
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
shows
what
proper
cellaring
can
do
for
the
right
beer
cheers
this
style
intrigues
me
as
im
slowly
learning
almost
everything
on
the
top
100
is
good
but
not
truly
great
a
very
solid
intro
to
the
style
and
something
i
would
give
to
someone
who
wants
to
see
what
beer
can
be
its
accessible
and
worth
it
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
underrated
beers
out
there
its
12
abv
yet
drinks
like
a
champ
its
readily
available
on
shelves
and
its
tastes
and
smells
awesome
what
a
great
beer
id
be
putting
away
cases
of
this
if
i
had
the
cellar
room
o
extremely
unique
for
me
i
want
to
know
more
about
how
this
beer
is
made
a
slow
sipper
that
warms
your
stomach
and
your
brain
i
love
it
lots
to
offer
in
one
bottle
sweet
tart
and
bitter
are
well
rounded
into
a
truly
delicious
creation
poured
vintage
2012
into
a
16
oz
snifter
pours
a
mahogany
with
a
two
inch
off
white
head
some
thin
lace
left
behind
smell
is
brown
sugar
carmel
molasses
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
booze
taste
is
that
nothing
really
dominant
all
about
the
malt
on
this
but
that
is
fine
and
expected
body
is
medium
large
the
amount
of
carbonation
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
size
a
touch
dry
and
drinkable
for
a
sipper
this
is
well
done
would
enjoy
even
more
on
a
cold
evening
great
old
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
wellmasked
alcohol
content
and
certainly
well
worth
aging
or
acquiring
some
older
batches
obviously
i
give
the
nod
to
the
11
but
both
are
great
overall
glad
i
could
try
these
two
side
by
side
it
would
be
great
to
lay
these
down
even
longer
north

makes
some
solid
brews
yum
this
is
very
good
i
get
the
recognition
drink
this
one
with
a
pipe
and
youll
be
in
heaven
thanks
egrace84
o
pretty
nice
stuff
i
cant
wait
to
try
these
guys
out
after
a
year
or
two
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
there
is
a
a
malty
aroma
that
has
a
wine
like
aroma
the
taste
is
like
a
full
body
wine
strong
grape
flavors
and
a
strong
vingerlike
backbone
rather
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
full

flavored
beer
overall
a
good
beer
interesting
and
different
pours
a
dark
amber
with
golden
hues
and
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
delicious
aroma
of
caramel
and
toffee
perhaps
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
booze
opens
with
the
smooth
taste
of
caramel
honey
sherry
joined
by
ripe
dark
fruit
and
biscuity
tones
and
finishes
ultrasmooth
pleasant
boozy
warmth
is
present
throughout
on
the
lighter
side
of
fullbodied
syrupy
with
enough
carbonation
to
make
itself
known
with
an
occasional
tickle
of
the
tongue
extremely
smooth
and
silky
highly
enjoyable
and
a
fantastic
example
of
an

this
is
a
powerful

feels

a
very
fine

im
going

put
a

better
with
age
i
drank
a
bottle
of
12
at
the
end
of
march
13
and
this
thing
has
morphed
into
a
sweet
boozy
barleywine
i
have
always
raised
my
ratings
of
a
beer
that
ages
well
so
i
will
follow
suit
with
this
one
also
after
thinking
i
would
never
buy
this
one
again
i
may
have
to
buy
some
13
to
start
a
vertical
o
this
is
an
excellent
old
ale
with
an
excellent
complexity
and
shockingly
wellhidden

definitely
a
sipper
but
those
who
let
this
one
warm
and
enjoy
it
over
time
will
be
wellrewarded
with
an
everevolving
flavor
profile
truly
an
enjoyable
experience
a
great
after
supper
treat
this
is
the
2012
bottle
and
pours
a
nice
mahogany

and

well
cheers
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
3
years
has
done
it
well
ive
never
had
it
fresh
but
i
certainly
cant
complain
with
this
vintage
very
sweet
upfront
hanging
in
there
throughout
with
a
bit
of
a
boozy
kick
on
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
boozy
after
taste
this
seems
like
it
is
way
to
sweet
and
boozy
without
enough
hop
balance
to
much
alcohol
taste
to
it
this
isnt
terrible
but
not
worth
the
price
unless
your
looking
for
something
on
the
boozy
end
overall
i
really
like
this
though
i
am
a
big
fan
of
big
malt
beers
surprisingly
well
balanced
for
a
11
9
beer
cant
wait
to
have
again
o
an
excellent
and
unique
strong
ale
with
almost
no
discernable
flaws
rich
and
powerful
this
beer
would
make
for
a
great
sipper
on
a
cold
night
assuming
the
drinkability
doesnt
have
you
finishing
the
whole
thing
in
a
few
minutes
going
into
my
regular
rotation
whenever
i
can
find
it
i
thought
i
would
let
this
one
age
longer
since
the
one
beer
i
had
when
i
bought
the
pair
was
a
drainpour
and
after
giving
into
opening
this
i
believed
my
impulsiveness
was
to
be
punished
with
a
rough
untempered
beer
instead
this
batch
has
smoothed
out
quite
quickly
suremore
shelftime
might
yield
even
more
developed
character
regardless
it
was
well
worth
indulging
in
today
definitely
a
classic
rich
and
complex
beer
big
in
flavour
and
alcohol
content
with
everything
coming
together
nicely
wellbalanced
and
a
delight
to
drink
as
i
come
here
i
now
understand
its
an
old
stock
ale
but
its
also
not
that
sweet
there
is
also
some
alcohol
in
the
taste
there
are
fruity
flavors
like
raisin

every
bit
as
good
as
i
remember
from
previous
vintages
it
may
be
an
old
ale
but
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
barleywine
though
less
thick
o
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
and
i
see
its
potential
as
it
stands
the
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
but
still
very
enjoyable
i
will
be
patiently
waiting
to
see
how
this
ages
overall
a
great
beer
maybe
a
bit
hot
now
but
i
will
have
to
buy
more
to
cellar
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
2011
version
this
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
okay
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
a
little
of
dark
fruit
prunes
caramel
and
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
to
thick
the
taste
is
pretty
good
lots
of
sweet
malts
the
prunes
molasses
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
bottle
2011
vintage
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
with
a
full
finger
tan
head
that
fell
fast
the
nose
is
very
subtle
for
a
barleywine
but
had
hints
of
earth
and
some
pruneplum
that
was
very
pleasant
its
very
rich
in
the
mouth
with
a
pleasant
caramel
malt
flavor
up
front
and
a
very
nice
warming
from
the
alcohol
at
the
finish
the
flavor
sticks
around
for
a
while
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
an
excellent
choice
on
a
very
cold
night
cheers
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
balanced
fullbodied
beer
overall
an
exceptional
brew
of
great
strength
very
complex
definitely
a
sipper
paired
well
with
smoked
almonds
would
love
to
see
what
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
would
produce
dr
its
a
great
beer
highly
drinkable
with
an
alcohol
punch
that
warms
but
doesnt
dissuade
really
lovely
everyone
should
try
this
im
impressed
this
was
a
vintage
2010
and
the
time
in
closet
did
not
harm
the
11
7
was
well
hidden
except
in
my
cheeks
o
a
lovely
beer
that
is
quite
good
fresh
and
benefits
substantially
with
some
years
in
the
cellar
no
longer
boozeheated
and
wellbittered
this
mellowed
miracle
in
a
glass
is
among
the
best
ive
tasted
i
now
feel
somewhat
smarter
for
starting
to
stash
these
away
a
few
years
back
because
the
payoff
is
well
sublime
overall
this
is
still
fairely
hot
but
its
a
good
candidate
for
aging
i
would
say
ive
had
some
really
awesome
old
ales
recently
and
this
one
does
not
quite
measure
up
to
kunhenn
4d
or
hair
of
the
dog
adam
the
beer
will
hold
its
own
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
brown
stubby
bottle
2011
vintage
pours
a
dull
brownish
red
a
gives
a
finger
of
light
khaki
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
absolutely
no
lace
the
nose
is
an
absolute
sweet
candy
malt
bomb
caramel
dark
fruits
big
alcohol
presence
in
the
back
from
the
nose
this
one
is
going
to
be
big
the
taste
is
as
expected
sweet
strong
caramel
malt
maybe
some
toasted
aspects
prunes
dark
dark
cherries
some
undesirable
medical
syrupy
flavor
and
the
alcohol
is
big
in
the
back
tingles
the
tongue
and
leaves
it
numb
and
dry
some
time
will
do
this
one
some
good
as
long
as
the
sweetness
holds
up
and
it
can
avoid
as
much
oxidation
as
possible
full
bodied
and
heavy
syrup
the
carbonation
is
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
messy
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
and
slightly
harsh
but
that
was
expected
improves
as
it
warms
not
what
i
want
out
of
an
old
ale
but
boy
is
this
thing
damn
good
overall
i
like
this
beer
im
no
expert
but
i
think
a
year
two
or
three
ago
it
was
probably
out
of
this
world
cellaring
to
try
at
5
and
10
years
overall
if
not
for
the
price
i
would
have
finished
the
4
pack
plan
to
age
my
remaining
2
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
should
greatly
improve
with
age
with
the
fruit
flavors
coming
out
more
looking
forward
to
a
year
on
the
bottle
has
some
sense
that
it
might
have
been
great
but
its
sharp
on
one
hand
and
simple
on
another
hot
and
cold
seems
unbalanced
overall
i
felt
the
beer
was
a
little
strong
for
my
palate
it
is
a
quality
brew
however
and
it
shows
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
as
it
is
a
little
strong
for
me
i
like
getting
my
alcohol
in
over
two
to
three
beers
rather
than
one
strong
one
i
should
also
note
the
old
stock
ale
i
bought
was
designated
2011
and
had
a
11
9
abv
rather
than
the
11
7
listed
on
the
ba
page
d
for
its
style
it
is
good
one
bottle
is
plenty
to
enjoy
for
awhile
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
that
are
going
to
sit
in
storage
for
a
few
years
maybe
even
a
decade
im
excited
to
see
how
time
changes
it
o
this
is
just
a
very
nice
beer
i
have
always
enjoyed
old
ales
and
this
one
is
another
great
one
this
isnt
one
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
but
its
nice
beer
to
relax
with
north
coast
is
a
great
brewery
this
is
one
great
beer
i
am
very
excited
to
see
what
a
year
or
two
will
do
with
this
i
would
reccommend
it
if
you
can
get
it
in
your
area
overall
this
is
my
first
english
old
ale
and
its
a
good
first
impression
this
was
the
2011
vintage
unaged
very
enjoyable
this
young
though
further
aging
will
only
bring
out
more
complex
flavors
i
have
three
more
bottles
that
will
be
aged
ill
be
interested
in
seeing
how
this
has
changed
after
a
year
or
more
of
aging
the
carbonation
isnt
terribly
present
until
you
take
a
sip
then
a
single
layer
of
microbubbles
effervesces
across
the
tongue
to
invigorate
the
drink
amazing
a
note
on
the
pricing
i
picked
up
a
4pk10
in
colorado
in
washington
ive
seen
a
4pk1314
and
3
50bottle
do
the
math
compared
to
most
nonbarrel
aged
barleywines
that
come
in
bombers
these
prices
are
typically
better
and
the
quality
of
the
beer
is
better
instead
i
hear
about
bigfoot
put
a
damn
leash
on
those
hops
why
is
this
called
a
barleywine
or
adam
tasty
but
without
oak
or
barrels
the
price
tag
is
uncalled
for
o
this
i
can
drink
everyday
over
a
nice
meal
or
bbq
the
light
touch
of
bourbon
really
makes
it
different
than
any
other
beers
ive
tasted
really
looked
forward
to
trying
this
one
and
it
did
not
disappoint
deep
ruby
garnet
color
thin
head
but
very
effervescent
on
the
pour
smells
of
caramel
brandy
port
wine
pear
leather
cocoa
needless
to
say
very
complex
aromas
taste
is
rich
warm
and
rewarding
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
sharp
carbonation
and
prickly
crisp
mouthfeel
flavors
are
abundant
currant
spice
vanilla
oak
tart
cherrylike
fruit
coffee
brown
sugar
clove
cocoa
hops
all
with
a
sublime
underpinning
of
rich
complex
malt
extreme
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
but
of
course
it
is
a
rare
style
to
be
found
this
is
s
special
treat
treat
it
with
respect
it
deserves
it
o
i
enjoyed
trying
this
one
worth
adding
to
the
list
but
wont
necessarily
be
seeking
it
out
rjt
o
the
taste
is
a
little
young
but
i
can
see
this
getting
better
with
age
good
thing
it
comes
in
a
4pack
so
i
can
drink
two
and
age
two
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
it
kind
of
let
me
down
granted
i
havent
had
many
old
ales
and
noting
the
alcohol
i
expected
it
to
be
present
but
not
the
main
feature
in
the
beer
could
this
benefit
from
more
aging
im
not
sure
the
flavors
are
pretty
muted
and
restrained
as
it
is
and
the
booze
aint
going
nowhere
m
medium
bodied
chewy
with
slight
alcohol
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
low
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
it
had
some
big
and
flavorful
malty
flavors
but
managed
to
balance
them
out
very
well
great
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
o
this
is
a
very
good
old
ale
without
much
of
a
twist
but
its
complex
and
beautiful
at
12
a
4pack
id
buy
it
again
but
ill
try
a
few
new
ones
first
it
was
also
surprisingly
difficult
to
locate
o
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
and
definitely
sits
somewhere
in
the
top
10
for
me
even
though
its
a
little
pricey
i
think
its
well
worth
it
overall
a
pretty
good
old
ale
flavors
are
bold
but
nothing
is
overwhelming
fairly
easy
drinking
for
a
fresh
bottle
o
great
beer
and
i
will
have
again
need
to
put
a
few
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
3
years
will
do
to
this
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
caramel
brown
with
large
quick
to
recede
tan
head
nose
is
light
fruits
dark
fruits
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
mollasses
taste
follows
suit
with
mollasses
fruits
caramel
and
some
alcohol
heat
presence
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
a
nice
sipper
of
an
old
ale
definitely
ranks
high
up
in
the
old
ale
category
a
musttry
for
anyone
who
enjoys
this
type
of
ales
comes
highly
recommended
i
would
liken
this
beer
to
a
sweeter
brandy
or
conac
this
is
actually
the
second
bottle
ive
sampled
out
of
a
4
pack
from
the
2011
vintage
the
first
i
sampled
fresh
and
this
one
with
a
few
months
of
age
on
it
the
difference
is
already
astonishing
some
of
the
alcohol
burn
i
noticed
in
the
first
one
has
receded
and
the
flavors
overall
have
become
more
complex
cant
wait
to
taste
the
other
two
after
a
year
or
so
overall
a
very
complex
beer
with
bold
aggressive
flavors
alcohol
is
not
very
balanced
but
not
overly
singeing
either
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
one
if
a
few
years
overallawesome
beer
could
be
for
dessert
or
with
a
meal
been
told
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
to
age
so
am
definitely
going
to
stock
up
and
try
one
every
few
months
and
another
update
2012
release
w
11
7
abv
and
a
different
look
to
the
bottle
wow
this
beer
is
a
treat
english
hops
and
malt
really
set
this
brew
apart
sweet
rich
classy
sophisticated
strong
keep
it
coming
overall
this
beer
actually
took
me
very
much
by
surprise
i
was
almost
expecting
to
not
like
this
because
of
the
style
but
then
again
i
cant
say
that
ive
had
an
old
ale
that
i
didnt
like
extremely
complex
beer
to
say
the
least
of
course
this
might
blur
the
lines
between
styles
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
any
other
way
with
this
beer
quite
good
and
im
going
to
have
to
age
some
certainly
cant
wait
to
try
old
stock
cellar
reserve
2009
this
is
a
must
try
in
my
book
o
interesting
style
i
like
it
but
it
combines
a
lot
of
flavors
in
interesting
ways
ill
have
to
try
a
few
more
within
the
style
to
fully
appreciate
this
one
overall
like
drinking
a
bourbon
and
coke
watch
out
the
11
7
creeps
in
fast
a
great
surprise
i
will
crave
more
of
pretty
much
the
staple
old
ale
very
nice
malt
character
to
this
a
little
hot
right
now
but
age
should
do
wonders
to
this
cant
wait
to
try
this
in
a
few
years
o
ive
had
the
old
stock
cellar
reserve
as
well
as
some
lightly
aged
regular
old
stock
so
i
know
what
this
beer
will
turn
in
to
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
more
fresh
d
very
drinkable
im
not
picking
up
the
booziness
that
others
have
noted
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
bettter
with
lots
of
age
on
it
otherwise
its
just
too
much
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
and
one
that
i
have
now
cellared
for
2010
and
2011
in
anticipation
of
collecting
through
2015
for
a
cellared
vertical
sip
this
beer
by
a
warm
fir
and
enjoy
it
in
moderation
friends
o
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
it
reminds
me
of
alcoholic
dr
pepper
i
say
that
lovingly
because
of
its
unmistakable
spicycherry
feel
trust
me
though
theres
certainly
much
more
in
this
bottle
than
those
23
flavors
dr
pepper
has
this
is
a
superbly
wellrounded
beer
tasty
enough
that
it
gives
yet
another
stimulus
to
my
growing
love
of
old
ales
a
vertical
of
this
would
be
amazing
or
even
its
barrelaged
counterpart
though
i
dont
know
how
soon
ill
be
shelling
out
20
for
a
bottle
of
the
stuff
o
i
very
well
done
example
of
an
old
ale
it
fits
perfectly
into
style
guidelines
alcohol
warmth
was
a
little
crazy
but
this
is
probably
a
beer
that
really
needs
to
be
aged
to
truly
bring
out
the
complex
flavors
english
barleywine
old
ale
whats
a
few
flavour
nuances
between
friends
a
lovely
sipper
strong
but
you
dont
immediately
know
it
and
very
well
balanced
a
preferable
steeling
against
the
newlyarrived
subzero
temperatures
into
which
i
intend
to
wade
overall
a
pretty
good
old
ale
but
most
of
the
rest
that
i
have
sampled
were
at
least
as
good
o
just
a
great
beer
definitely
one
of
the
benchmarks
of
the
style
affordable
too
i
have
this
every
year
and
think
that
the
2011
vintage
might
be
the
best
one
yet
pours
a
mahogany
body
with
just
a
bit
of
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
collar
big
wafts
of
molasses
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
and
dates
are
carried
up
on
streams
of
hot
alcoholic
vapors
this
is
clearly
going
to
be
some
concentrated
stuff
i
love
that
the
flavors
of
super
sweet
without
being
medicinal
with
notes
of
amontillado
sherry
lending
a
nuttiness
to
the
autumnal
sugars
the
carbonation
is
low
but
still
substantial
enough
to
keep
an
otherwise
sticky
beer
from
gluing
your
mouth
shut
a
slow
sipper
to
be
sure
and
one
that
should
be
in
everyones
arsenal
as
the
weather
turns
cold
this
2011
is
a
very
special
beer
t
raisin
fig
burnt
brown
sugar
brandysoaked
apricots
and
some
belgian
yeast
its
definitely
a
bit
syrupy
and
you
feel
the
alcohol
pretty
quickly
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
though
a
good
sipping
beer
but
a
little
overly
sweet
for
my
taste
a
little
more
bitterness
or
hop
character
may
have
provided
more
balance
this
is
the
2011
vintage
and
has
lots
of
potential
to
improve
with
age
overall
drinkability
i
wonder
if
this
one
would
be
better
aged
but
otherwise
good
and
beer
for
sipping
and
savoring
not
a
great
looking
beer
absence
of
head
and
lacing
but
otherwise
tasty
although
i
think
it
would
be
best
in
the
winter
given
the
warming
aspects
o
out
of
balance
for
my
taste
i
can
enjoy
a
half
a
bottle
but
a
full
bottle
may
be
too
much
this
bottle
is
the
recent
2011
vintage
this
one
pours
a
caramel
syrup
brown
in
color
medium
in
body
with
an
off
white
lacing
around
my
snifter
it
smells
of
light
chocolate
malts
perhaps
some
crystal
malts
with
a
light
essence
of
cherry
and
light
sweetness
the
flavors
are
very
sweet
and
sugary
malts
you
get
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
caramelized
sugar
molasses
and
toffee
its
very
very
sweet
pretty
indicative
of
a
fresh
old
ale
its
sticky
and
drinks
thicker
than
it
looks
due
to
the
sugar
overall
its
a
fine
old
ale
but
it
takes
a
backseat
to
hotd
adam
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
is
spectacular
so
i
may
have
to
sit
on
a
few
bottles
o
great
old
ale
especially
for
the
price
and
availability
north
coast
is
great
for
bang
for
the
buck
and
ease
of
acquisition
and
this
beer
is
no
different
o
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
on
tap
i
would
like
the
opportunity
to
try
a
cellared
bottle
at
some
point
though
i
would
definitely
take
the
time
to
try
this
again
regardless
beats
the
hell
out
of
brandy
mouthfeel
delicate
and
chewy
yet
sharp
clingy
sharp
and
alcoholic
acidic
the
malts
clean
up
in
the
back
and
help
the
ale
go
down
smooth
both
smooth
and
slightly
harsh
only
the
slightest
in
natural
carbonation
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
old
ale
not
the
best
of
its
class
but
still
damn
good
o
its
a
sipper
if
you
like
sweet
boozy
beers
with
a
little
balance
then
this
is
for
you
personally
i
love
this
one
a
single
bottle
would
last
at
least
an
hour
while
watching
a
movie
o
i
was
expecting
alot
more
with
this
one
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
a
candidate
to
age
ive
never
come
across
a
beer
that
was
this
bad
early
on
that
will
drastically
change
into
something
awesome
with
age
ill
hold
out
on
trying
any
more
unless
its
got
some
considerable
age
on
it
i
must
revisit
overall
i
do
love
this
ale
i
might
favor
this
brew
over
most
old
ales
but
it
is
a
good
brew
regardless
of
my
opinion
i
found
a
small
store
by
me
that
had
two
four
packs
stuffed
away
and
when
i
got
them
home
i
realized
they
were
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
aged
i
was
happy
with
my
score
for
10
a
four
pack
o
not
a
bad
beer
glad
to
gave
access
to
it
as
we
reach
into
the
cold
winter
months
a
sipper
no
doubt
o
body
was
promising
until
the
had
head
away
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
top
choice
for
me
i
guess
o
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
a
great
brew
otherwise
this
beer
ages
incredibly
well
i
wish
i
had
waited
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
11
o
definitely
want
some
more
to
cellar
this
is
so
damn
good
it
is
very
difficult
to
completely
describe
adding
to
my
favorites
list
for
sure
overall
just
my
style
i
love
giant
boozy
old
ales
i
have
a
bunch
of
these
in
the
cellar
and
i
like
to
crack
one
open
when
i
feel
like
zonking
out
on
the
couch
a
little
harsh
on
the
booze
but
its
within
the
style
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
on
tap
when
i
had
it
last
year
but
either
this
years
version
is
better
or
it
just
works
better
in
the
bottle
the
alcohol
flavor
is
mellower
and
it
is
a
very
impressive
pleasant
and
drinkable
old
ale
o
awesome
brew
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
my
others
do
with
a
few
more
years
on
them
i
hope
to
be
rereviewing
and
updating
2011
version
despite
the
nearly
12
abv
id
classify
this
as
a
good
beer
to
hand
someone
who
has
never
before
had
a
heavy
hitter
the
color
isnt
terribly
dark
the
aroma
isnt
terribly
powerful
the
taste
isnt
terribly
strong
the
alcohol
doesnt
hit
too
hard
but
there
is
an
odd
taste
of
pizza
maybe
a
plain
cheese
pizza
with
too
much
red
sauce
i
dont
know
it
isnt
bad
however
just
out
of
place
theres
a
big
hit
of
peaches
as
well
along
with
the
usual
stuff
you
find
in
a
big
beer
like
this
worth
a
try
especially
on
a
headingintofall
evening
mediumhigh
carbonation
tingles
the
tongue
the
whole
time
its
mediumbodied
thats
smooth
but
with
a
tad
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
fairly
sweet
which
gets
a
little
bit
old
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
flavor
is
interesting
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
complexity
i
will
save
a
couple
bottles
and
try
again
in
a
year
or
two
o
so
i
didnt
like
the
smell
but
that
was
after
taking
multiple
inquisitive
whiffs
this
is
a
fantastic
interpretation
of
the
style
sweet
and
strong
but
balanced
enough
to
keep
it
drinkable
i
havent
had
this
since
2007
and
its
every
good
as
i
remember
it
being
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
reviews
and
from
what
i
had
heard
and
wasnt
let
down
at
all
this
one
is
almost
like
a
sweet
barley
wine
its
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
too
much
or
cloying
and
its
complex
without
being
too
complicated
its
hard
to
explain
the
above
comments
but
i
do
know
that
i
enjoyed
it
well
a
must
try
curious
to
see
how
it
will
age
shared
a
2010
with
a
friend
thanks
john
thick
rich
heavy
and
sweet
malt
aroma
that
very
much
resembles
a
barleywine
complex
sweet
and
sometimes
candy
like
small
head
that
leaves
a
small
minimal
amount
flavor
is
complex
with
great
malt
flavors
has
richness
but
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
expect
light
flavors
from
the
oak
are
nice
moderately
heavy
body
with
nice
smoothness
very
nice
drink
and
enjoyed
greatly
no
doubt
an
alcohol
presence
in
the
mouthfeel
that
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
will
put
a
few
back
for
aging
and
expect
different
but
good
results
down
the
road
o
good
stuff
ill
bet
this
one
will
age
nicely
2010
version
deep
mahogany
color
with
loads
of
roasted
butterscotch
and
some
wood
in
the
nose
that
butterscotch
flavor
absolutely
coats
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
sour
tang
in
the
finish
hops
add
a
welcome
kick
and
some
bitterness
but
dont
get
in
the
way
of
anything
picking
up
some
grapes
and
late
chocolate
as
it
warms
its
a
heavy
hitter
at
more
than
11
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
just
a
pleasant
warmth
a
really
solid
english
barleywine
there
was
some
good
fruitiness
and
malt
depth
here
unfortunately
i
felt
like
i
didnt
quite
get
this
beer
as
it
didnt
scream
greatness
to
me
drink
a
nice
old
ale
its
a
12
oz
is
awesome
very
balanced
and
rich
big
notes
of
vanilla
and
malt
not
overly
done
but
still
smooth
and
tasty
dark
red
almost
brown
looks
dirty
in
a
good
way
lots
of
raisin
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
alcohol
lots
of
dark
fruit
same
on
the
taste
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
the
smell
this
couldve
been
better
but
still
really
good
the
taste
just
doesnt
match
up
with
the
nose
nose
is
very
strong
taste
well
not
so
much
very
light
in
body
compared
to
what
i
feel
it
should
be
nose
indicates
fuller
mouthfeel
just
not
there
still
good
dont
get
me
wrong
just
didnt
meet
expectations
once
i
smelled
it
picture
raison
dextra
minus
the
extra
thats
what
this
is
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
the
only
thing
that
i
can
fault
this
beer
for
is
being
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
the
flavors
are
all
spot
on
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
the
sugar
is
covering
some
of
the
more
nuanced
tastes
while
there
is
some
alcohol
it
serves
to
exemplify
the
flavors
and
is
nowhere
approaching
the
near
12
this
beer
contains
a
great
old
ale
that
should
age
with
the
best
of
them
now
i
want
to
try
the
2009
bourbonaged
version
o
this
is
incredible
its
a
bit
sweeter
than
id
like
at
this
point
but
shoot
its
tasty
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
maybe
a
very
good
bench
mark
for
the
style
big
depth
on
the
texture
and
body
notes
even
with
warming
up
the
aroma
remains
a
bit
weak
oh
do
enjoy
this
one
i
can
tell
it
will
age
well
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
head
smells
darker
than
it
looks
dark
malty
aromas
like
toffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
i
feel
like
i
smell
something
reminiscent
of
dark
fruits
as
well
flavors
of
caramel
and
toffee
maltiness
finishing
up
with
some
spicy
yeast
flavors
beer
is
smooth
but
very
warming
to
the
esophagus
it
took
a
bit
for
my
palate
to
adjust
i
do
enjoy
it
more
and
more
as
i
sip
on
super
unique
taste
i
have
a
hard
time
comparing
it
to
another
beer
well
worth
cellaring
i
had
four
this
was
the
last
and
best
example
of
the
four
o
fairly
enjoyable
beer
easy
drinkability
for
how
high
the
abv
is
nothing
too
special
as
to
seek
out
again
but
glad
to
try
it
once
overall
i
enjoyed
this
it
has
been
in
my
gonna
drink
fridge
for
over
six
months
i
am
glad
i
finally
pulled
the
trigger
on
it
pick
this
up
when
you
get
the
chance
i
promise
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
i
cant
wait
for
my
2010
batch
to
age
even
more
this
was
a
positive
experience
in
all
facets
of
beer
rating
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
the
second
year
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
drink
this
delicious
beer
and
i
gotta
say
it
is
easily
on
my
island
list
if
such
a
thing
exists
dessert
in
a
glass
without
being
sweet
and
cloying
the
only
ding
in
my
score
comes
from
this
and
all
the
past
old
stock
ales
from
north
coast
have
had
almost
no
head
apart
from
that
this
beer
would
have
been
all
5s
i
look
forward
to
further
editions
of
this
ale
i
promise
to
drink
more
judiciously
in
the
future
hold
on
to
this
6
months
before
you
try
one
2010
bottle
pours
a
very
clear
garnet
with
a
thin
ring
of
head
nose
is
rich
with
raisins
dried
tobacco
leafs
caramel
malt
mouth
is
sweet
syrup
dark
fruits
leafy
hops
tobacco
finish
is
long
with
tobacco
leaf
a
bit
to
its
detriment
im
not
sure
whether
that
is
oxidation
or
just
some
lingering
hop
character
to
be
sure
though
this
2010
bottle
is
way
way
better
now
in
august
2011
than
it
was
in
august
2010
as
ive
had
a
few
over
the
months
much
more
mature
rich
and
tight
o
i
was
pretty
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
went
in
expecting
to
like
it
but
not
as
much
as
i
ended
up
big
bold
flavors
are
what
this
is
all
about
the
beer
is
dark
ruby
hued
with
a
thin
wispy
tan
head
that
leaves
faint
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
malt
toffee
alcohol
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
notes
of
toffee
caramel
candies
malt
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
the
sweetness
is
present
throughout
but
not
cloying
the
beer
actually
reminds
me
of
samichlaus
good
stuff
this
will
certainly
age
well
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
this
beer
rocks
thats
the
easiest
way
to
put
it
its
like
drinking
a
heath
candybar
a
little
hot
on
the
alcohol
but
otherwise
a
total
world
class
beer
i
will
pick
this
up
whenever
i
see
it
it
has
a
dark
burnt
red
tone
with
a
speck
of
head
the
smell
contains
raisins
heavy
malt
some
caramel
taking
a
sip
slowly
of
this
beer
and
i
taste
more
raisins
and
other
dark
fruit
more
sweetness
including
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mf
is
full
bodied
and
warms
you
up
with
the
booze
level
this
is
one
of
the
best
old
ales
that
i
can
recall
sampling
over
the
years
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
i
would
live
to
try
one
that
i
has
been
sitting
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
at
some
point
down
the
road
overall
this
is
an
excellent
old
ale
the
flavors
of
the
beer
are
rich
and
complex
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
have
again
o
very
good
beer
a
bit
hot
but
will
definitely
come
to
age
in
a
year
or
two
a
must
try
and
must
age
this
journey
will
be
fun
looks
like
iced
tea
in
my
pint
glass
no
head
whatsoever
smell
is
alcohol
and
caramel
sweetness
tastes
like
straight
up
cough
syrup
at
first
then
settles
down
to
a
nice
caramel
with
slight
cherry
taste
that
coats
the
mouth
it
instantly
fizzes
in
your
mouth
after
a
sip
very
heavy
mouthfeel
and
definitely
a
sipper
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
will
taste
a
few
years
down
the
road
as
i
think
the
alcohol
burn
will
settle
and
the
beer
will
release
much
more
flavor
that
is
currently
hidden
this
is
a
big
ale
with
some
good
complexity
a
solid
version
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
rich
reddish
brown
color
with
very
little
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
caramel
sweet
the
flvor
is
very
smooth
with
the
caramel
malty
goodness
up
front
for
almost
12
there
is
very
little
burn
to
support
it
mouthfeel
is
right
on
lower
carbonation
and
thick
overall
a
very
solid
beer
o
a
real
sipper
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
certainly
a
real
good
beer
and
u
s
rep
of
the
style
overall
this
is
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
i
would
imagine
that
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
the
alcohol
would
mellow
out
some
and
it
might
be
even
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
as
it
is
this
beer
is
still
a
wonderful
brew
to
slowly
savor
on
this
rainy
summer
day
an
hour
in
and
the
head
and
lacing
is
gone
its
sitting
in
the
glass
much
like
a
hard
liquor
and
it
has
leeegggs
i
enjoy
this
one
from
time
to
time
i
often
come
back
to
it
i
dont
think
its
super
special
but
it
has
a
niche
overall
this
was
my
first
old
ale
and
i
was
very
surprised
to
how
much
like
a
barleywine
it
truly
was
if
you
love
malty
sweetness
with
some
alcoholic
heat
this
is
a
must
try
for
me
its
not
a
flavor
profile
that
is
among
my
favorites
this
been
has
been
referred
to
as
a
dessert
beer
and
i
can
see
that
its
not
as
thick
as
most
dessert
beers
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
this
beer
is
big
and
very
very
very
good
did
i
just
find
a
new
favorite
beer
o
really
great
beer
not
sure
if
the
newer
versions
would
live
up
to
this
but
something
with
this
much
age
on
it
is
quite
good
very
easy
to
drink
12oz

a
dark
mahogany
color
with
ruby
hues
and
no
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
boozey
a
bit
earthy
with
some
dark
fruits
but
the
alcohol
dominates
this
one
im
not
a
big
alcohol
drinker
but
this
one
smells
maybe
like
bourbon
taste
is
mostly
of
toffee
and
booze
i
didnt
expect
a
whole
bunch
of
flavors
due
to
the
high
abv
but
there
isnt
too
much
taste
other
than
the
alcohol
flavor
but
its
still
a
good
beer
obviously
not
a
high
drinkability
here
its
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
next
to
compare
overall
its
good
to
grab
every
so
often
this
is
a
very
good
old
ale
its
also
widely
available
and
well
suited
to
aging
making
it
a
great
beer
to
hold
on
to
to
make
a
vertical
my
current
collection
goes
back
to
2008
the
high
abv
will
affect
you
quickly
making
this
a
beer
that
you
enjoy
slowly
but
that
also
allows
you
to
savor
it
it
comes
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
amber
maroon
with
about
a
finger
of
fizzy
foam
which
dissipates
within
a
minute
wow
thats
audible
fizz
no

smell
is
pretty
muted
sweet
grape
a
little

and
toffee
brandy
a
little
alcohol
tastes
like
grape
malt
a
little
hoppiness
smoky
caramel
a
little
booziness
as
it
warms
a
lot
of
the
primary
flavors
become
muted
to
the
point
of
not
tasting
much
except
malt
and
hops
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
body
and
warming
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
good
middle
of
the
road
old
ale
with
some
nice
flavors
but
nothing
standout
this
remains
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
ill
be
getting
more
to
cellar
as
this
beer
only
gets
better
with
time
m
mediumtothick
body
carbonation
is
mild
but
what
i
would
expect
for
a
stronger
beer
syrupy
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
sticky
deep
alcohol
warmth
hits
the
chest
from
first
sip
to
last
o
this
beer
is
well
balanced
while
providing
some
nice
in
your
face
flavors
without
being
overwhelming
definitely
worth
a
try
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
a
sipper
overall
pretty
darn
tasty
and
one
unique
smelling
brew
2010
the
initial
pour
has
a
nice
pillow
of
foam
that
quickly
dissappears
but
every
sip
brings
champagne
like
bubbles
up
the
side
of
the
glass
the
color
is
toffeemohagany
like
and
reminds
me
of
the
chocolote
river
in
willy
wonka
which
makes
it
equally
inviting
to
drink
smells
like
caramel
apple
and
cotton
candy
this
is
getting
better
than
a
chocolate
river
and
fig
with
similar
tastes
of
caramel
hints
of
vanilla
and
raisinprune
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
it
is
in
the
12
range
because
it
seems
extremely
sessionable
but
i
did
notice
a
warm
alcohol
finish
that
assures
me
that
it
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
but
thoroughly
in
my
case
bottle
2007
vintage
pours
a
dark
copper
reddish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
swirling
generates
a
nice
darker
tan
head
head
settles
and
collars
around
the
glass
nicely
caramel
toffee
biscuit
and
slight
booze
round
out
the
nose
this
things
smells
sweet
caramel
sweet
upfront
some
dark
fruit
flavors
as
well
overall
rather
sweet
but
easily
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
found
this
to
be
a
drink
that
may
need
to
be
set
aside
to
age
i
wasnt
impressed
by
the
new
2011
vintage
but
i
wasnt
really
let
down
either
im
curious
to
see
how
the
age
will
change
it
o
i
enjoy
this
brew
the
2010
was
the
first
ive
had
and
i
have
a
2011
that
i
am
cellaring
but
i
wanted
to
make
sure
to
have
it
fresh
as
well
so
i
had
a
point
of
reference
when
i
crack
it
in
a
few
years
exceptional
malt
depth
and
breadth
on
the
mouthfeel
is
this
really
pushing
12
every
indication
said
too
sweet
but
this
beer
absolutely
works
the
beer
is
hot
but
the
deliciousness
makes
the
alcohol
tolerable
very
light
carbonation
but
it
manages
to
feel
prickly
due
to
the
alcohol
heat
o
locally
i
pay
3
50
for
this
beer
and
think
its
worth
every
penny
a
great
beer
on
some
week
night
after
work
when
you
just
want
to
pour
one
and
enjoy
it
slowly
or
a
beer
to
have
when
sitting
down
to
a
game
or
movie
because
its
not
one
youll
finish
in
10
minutes
most
likely
drinkability
nice
balance
of
dark
fruits
and
overall
sweetness
subtle
pockets
of
flavors
keep
you
hooked
and
interested
complex
and
rich
paired
nicely
with
some
stilton
cheese
excellent
cheers
d
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
very
hot
and
sweet
from
all
the
alcohol
i
am
a
fan
of
lowerhopped
englishstyle
barley
wines
but
this
one
could
use
some
additional
element
to
add
complexity
and
bring
some
of
the
focus
away
from
the
unbalanced
alcohol
i
aged
it
2
years
hoping
the
alcohol
would
dilute
a
bit
but
i
think
i
opened
it
too
early
it
was
a
great
dark
brown
beer
it
has
roasted
nut
aromas
with
a
caramel
lingering
finish
the
nose
was
pretty
average
smelled
like
stainless
steel
barrel
the
alcohol
is
a
little
highit
definitely
could
have
aged
for
another
2
years
its
too
bad
north
coast
brewing
co
is
not
going
to
ship
to
louisiana
during
the
summer
months
i
guess
i
better
stock
up
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
ale
i
am
a
big
fan
of
strong
ale
but
this
was
nothing
like
i
expected
it
poured
like
a
coke
a
quick
fizzy
head
formed
and
rapidly
disappeared
entirely
the
appearance
was
like
a
red
ale
and
very
clear
the
mouth
feel
was
thin
the
taste
was
akin
to
brown
ale
with
a
shot
of
whiskey
this
is
no
exaggeration
it
lacked
complexity
and
character
i
was
all
around
just
a
hard
ale
to
drink
i
am
hoping
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
i
will
cellar
this
and
see
what
it
tastes
like
in
a
year
o
a
very
complex
brew
not
for
every
occasion
for
sure
but
this
was
a
nice
example
of
an
old
ale
i
see
more
of
this
sipper
in
my
future
when
i
saw
this
on
the
menu
at
holy
smoke
i
frankly
had
no
idea
what
it
was
never
had
an
old
ale
before
so
it
came
out
in
a
4
tasting
flight
looked
like
a
very
bubbly
cheerwine
that
monstrosity
of
a
soda
from
nc
almost
no
head
whatsoever
first
taste
and
smell
and
im
thinking
how
come
it
didnt
say
barleywine
on
the
menu
not
as
overtly
sweet
as
your
typical
barleywine
but
many
of
the
same
characteristics
caramel
butterscotch
vanilla
at
almost
12
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
still
a
sipper
however
my
5
ounce
pour
was
the
perfect
quantity
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
although
it
is
still
not
reached
maturity
yet
as
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
alcohol
heavy
preventing
complete
enjoymentsavoring
looking
forward
to
cellaring
and
sampling
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
over
the
next
couple
years
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
12
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
nothing
very
small
spots
of
lacing
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
caramel
rum
raisin
and
malt
a
very
nice
sweet
raisin
bread
aroma
on
this
beer
taste
is
very
sweet
and
rich
with
brown
sugarcaramel
and
raisin
bread
flavors
low
carbonation
with
a
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
throat
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
stumbled
on
at
my
local
whole
foods
in
early
2011
i
think
they
found
a
4
pack
in
the
back
that
they
put
out
for
sale
after
tasting
this
years
brew
i
am
kicking
myself
for
not
buying
more
than
one
i
will
look
into
getting
these
each
year
that
they
are
released
for
aging
purposes
overall
a
quality
old
ale
not
a
beer
that
im
going
to
want
to
drink
another
of
but
a
good
beer
to
spend
an
hour
with
pours
a
deep
burnt
redorange
hue
very
very
bubbly
cream
tan
head
with
a
hint
of
gold
stuck
around
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
split
spiced
malt
brown
sugar
and
wood
a
little
toasty
as
well
very
pleasing
nice
malty
sweetness
that
works
hand
in
hand
with
some
toasted
malts
and
a
nice
caress
of
hops
this
beer
presents
a
nice
balance
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
towards
the
back
of
each
sip
just
a
hint
of
a
winelike
acidity
which
seems
to
open
this
beer
up
a
bit
after
letting
this
sit
im
getting
some
rasin
and
booze
flavors
a
nice
change
from
other
strong
ales
very
curious
to
see
what
age
will
do
to
this
o
a
drinkable
sweet
beer
although
i
could
taste
next
to
no
hops
to
balance
this
beer
the
malt
contributes
some
relatively
complex
flavors
vi
concluding
thoughts
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
you
see
this
somewhere
pick
up
a
case
and
cellar
it
for
a
few
years
full
bodied
milder
carbonation
a
bit
heavy
but
smooth
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
considering
the
heavier
profile
and
high
abv
this
drinks
pleasantly
and
could
still
benefit
from
significant
aging
a
fine
old
ale
overall
but
a
little
boozy
for
my
taste
id
like
to
try
this
again
with
a
little
more
age
and
can
only
imagine
it
will
be
improved
i
like
the
2009
barrel
aged
version
better
but
this
isnt
bad
in
conclusion
i
am
certainly
excited
to
wait
until
next
may
to
try
the
next
one
because
some
of
the
goopyness
needs
to
mature
away
d
did
my
office
sprout
oak
paneled
walls
while
i
wasnt
looking
this
is
a
very
strong
but
pleasant
slowsipping
beer
i
plan
to
stock
up
and
try
it
again
in
a
few
years
o
very
good
stuff
and
i
cant
wait
to
age
sometry
older
vintages
o
good
stuff
fresh
to
me
is
not
overly
complex
given
the
alcohol
i
like
this
beer
though
and
have
now
started
to
set
aside
a
vertical
of
it
and
am
looking
forward
to
try
some
vintage
bottles
o
the
scotch
notes
are
what
surprised
me
the
much
with
this
brew
very
interesting
all
around
but
a
little
too
much
alcohol
for
my
taste
drinkability
is
lower
than
average
because
of
this
very
reason
still
it
became
one
of
my
favorite
beer
notes
from
2008
a
freight
train
of
a
beer
this
pours
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
sweet
and
a
little
smokey
some
roasted
malts
in
there
too
perhaps
even
some
hops
shining
through
it
in
the
back
too
the
taste
is
very
complex
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
barely
wine
really
there
was
a
strong
alcohol
warming
sensation
here
also
there
were
some
rich
dark
fruits
and
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thicker
side
overall
a
tasty
brew
the
appearance
is
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
matter
that
much
to
me
but
its
a
certain
shade
of
browny
orange
with
no
head
that
looks
somewhat
unappetizing
smell
makes
up
for
it
boy
howdy
raisins
leather
caramel
candied
orange
peel
fig
syrup
taste
follows
the
nose
a
pleasant
sweetness
and
very
well
concealed
abv
thick
but
not
cloying
this
is
a
treat
and
this
vintage
was
still
just
gathering
dust
on
the
shelf
ill
be
clearing
the
shelf
of
the
rest
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slightly
chewy
with
a
syruplike
quality
to
it
overall
old
stock
ale
is
one
heckuva
maltbomb
estimated
age
of
68
months
makes
this
bottle
a
bit
too
young
for
it
to
peak
in
flavor
once
the
alcohol
cools
down
a
bit
i
could
see
this
being
a
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
trade
off
a
couple
abv
points
to
add
to
the
feel
and
taste
this
beer
is
much
more
enjoyable
when
paired
with
an
equally
strongflavored
item
i
tried
one
while
eating
brie
and
it
went
nice
together
some
cinnamon
ice
cream
tonight
isnt
bad
either
overall
enjoyable
old
ale
im
sure
this
beer
will
age
nicely
not
the
first
or
the
last
time
ill
purchase
this
brew
hope
to
hold
on
to
one
for
a
few
years
and
age
o
pretty
good
even
with
the
hints
of
alcohol
which
werent
entirely
unexpected
at
11
7
good
flavor
but
the
high
carbonation
was
a
bit
strange
this
beer
pours
a
thick
brown
color
with
little
head
the
aroma
has
strong
notes
of
caramel
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
starts
with
a
caramel
sweetness
and
then
moves
to
fruity
fig
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
overcarbonated
and
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
apparent
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
make
sure
you
sip
it
d
had
to
take
this
one
slow
but
it
was
delicious
definitely
needs
a
few
years
to
calm
down
but
seems
like
it
can
only
get
better
from
here
north
coast
old
stock
ale
is
most
definitely
a
sipper
and
at
11
7
abv
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
however
the
complexity
and
excellent
sweetness
makes
each
sip
most
enjoyable
overall
very
good
almost
barleywine
overall
ive
had
this
style
before
im
pretty
sure
but
i
dont
remember
when
since
i
dont
review
every
beer
i
drink
i
dont
find
it
overly
complicated
but
im
new
to
this
style
i
like
it
for
sure
however
its
just
too
new
to
make
a
strong
statement
about
it
o
in
my
opinion
enjoyed
best
when
sipped
at
cellar
temp
and
treated
like
a
fine
whiskey
a
well
crafted
beer
thats
not
my
favorite
style
overall
this
an
excellent
beer
it
could
use
some
more
time
to
mature
but
it
is
well
on
its
way
to
becoming
a
truly
amazing
beer
an
excellent
choice
for
an
evening
of
sipping
after
a
big
meal
spot
on
for
style
this
is
what
barley
wines
should
strive
to
be
tastes
of
sweet
malt
with
plenty
of
dark
fruits
caramel
and
even
some
toastiness
finishes
with
a
strong
estery
alcohol
bite
that
goes
down
warm
but
not
too
hot
some
oak
is
also
detected
sticky
brown
sugar
like
flavor
coats
the
palate
extremely
smooth
considering
the
strength
has
a
thick
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
a
considerable
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
one
delicious
malt
bomb
the
11
abv
makes
itself
known
old
stock
is
a
sipper
and
is
surely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
wonderfully
complex
and
delicious
this
is
a
very
good
old
ale
a
beer
id
treat
myself
to
once
every
45
months
or
so
glad
i
have
one
more
2008
left
o
quite
a
nice
brew
minimal
complexity
but
lots
of
subtlety
and
refinement
will
buy
it
again
no
doubt
overall
i
think
this
is
definitely
worth
buying
and
heartily
recommend
it
for
a
good
night
of
reading
and
drinking
or
watching
a
movie
and
drinking
overall
fantastically
complex
old
ale
goes
down
far
too
easy
for
an
11
70
beer
really
need
to
buy
a
4pack
or
two
and
cellar
it
for
a
few
years
but
i
would
never
turn
this
down
fresh
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
cant
say
enough
about
north
coast
also
had
it
on
a
growler
filled
at
consumers
beverage
in
lockport
ny
near
buffalo
in
late
december
2010
this
reminds
me
of
port
this
is
dessert
for
me
very
enjoyable
but
ones
my
limit
too
sweet
to
have
two
in
one
night
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
dig
it
something
i
always
consider
buying
a
few
packs
of
to
have
hanging
around
for
that
affordable
yet
solid
old
ale
itch
i
always
get
o
this
was
a
very
pleasant
find
in
a
local
bottle
shop
i
was
going
to
polish
off
the
four
pack
but
i
think
ill
sit
on
a
couple
of
these
for
another
year
or
two
i
have
had
a
lot
of
great
barleywinesold
ales
lately
and
this
one
fell
on
its
face
in
comparison
o
this
one
is
heavy
on
the
alcohol
so
be
prepared
however
its
truly
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sit
on
for
an
hour
or
so
as
your
body
warms
up
and
takes
in
the
complex
flavor
that
this
one
throws
at
you
its
filled
with
spice
dark
fruits
warmth
and
sweetness
and
is
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
definitely
will
be
putting
a
couple
of
these
away
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
a
little
age
will
do
for
it
found
a
four
pack
of
2009
at
a
local
store
and
eventhough
they
have
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
while
i
took
the
chance
that
they
would
be
aged
nicely
i
was
right
this
beer
is
now
mellowed
and
blended
to
show
off
the
dark
fruit
and
the
cognac
notes
while
still
keeping
the
hops
in
the
mix
not
as
big
as
old
guardian
or
old
crusty
but
still
lots
of
mouthfeel
and
still
a
few
more
years
in
the
cellar
would
add
to
the
beer
this
brew
has
been
aging
well
so
far
i
cant
wait
to
give
it
more
time
d
kinda
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
i
was
happy
stopping
at
one
ive
got
several
of
these
to
age
over
the
next
few
years
but
even
fresh
this
beer
is
incredible
for
something
this
intense
and
boozy
its
superbly
drinkable
god
damn
this
is
good
d
the
beer
tastes
very
strong
but
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
well
masked
this
definitely
a
sipping
beer
poured
out
a
cloudy
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
hue
it
had
a
small
shortlived
offwhite
head
that
left
no
lace
it
smelled
of
brandy
fruitiness
and
sweet
caramel
malt
it
tasted
very
sweet
and
a
little
boozy
it
had
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
with
a
subtle
chocolate
taste
it
was
soft
smooth
and
dry
a
mediumbodied
ale
with
a
warm
alcohol
presence
this
was
very
good
but
didnt
live
up
to
my
hopes
id
like
to
try
a
newer
version
to
compare
the
cpj
pours
a
rugged
ruby
red
with
barely
any
head
because
of
the
high
abv
the
nose
brings
scents
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
this
one
is
meant
for
age
the
taste
is
beast
bold
caramel
and
butterscotch
tones
blast
through
an
alcohol
soaked
biscuit
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
bold
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
create
a
good
bite
the
alcohol
presence
is
noticed
which
is
what
makes
this
brew
a
giant
one
or
two
and
call
it
a
night
moderate
sweet
malt
sticks
to
the
palate
between
tastes
carbonation
is
lighterthanaverage
this
vintage
reminds
me
of
an
unripe
thomas
hardys
ale
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
is
an
excellent
candidate
for
aging
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
booziness
will
subside
over
the
years
drinkability
good
but
a
define
need
for
age
is
apparent
d
this
is
a
sipper
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
put
the
remaining
3
in
my
cellar
to
see
what
some
age
will
do
the
rating
doesnt
do
this
beer
justice
its
meant
for
aging
not
drinking
fresh
but
i
had
to
try
it
fresh
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
quite
sweet
but
the
layered
flavors
and
aroma
are
a
trip
to
enjoy
i
look
forward
to
purchasing
another
and
aging
it
for
a
year
or
so
enjoy
but
be
careful
with
this
one
drinks
well
but
slowly
overall
a
good
strong
ale
but
nothing
to
rave
about
drinkability
is
lower
than
i
like
mostly
because
of
the
abv
i
dont
think
i
can
enjoy
two
bottles
of
this
beer
without
the
deleterious
effects
of
the
abv
to
me
this
is
a
minus
overall
i
enjoyed
the
bal
aged
version
way
more
this
is
a
rather
boring
old
ale
it
is
decent
but
fairly
average
drinking
24
oz
of
this
might
be
a
challenge
overall
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
review
very
foreign
to
me
but
enjoyable
this
would
make
a
good
special
occasion
beer
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
quad
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
beer
does
in
a
year
or
two
really
enjoyed
it
now
but
im
sure
it
will
only
get
better
glassware
thistle
i
bet
this
one
turns
out
to
be
a
star
in
a
few
years
d
i
will
have
to
say
this
beer
has
an
acquired
taste
i
can
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
that
went
into
the
beer
but
this
is
a
one
time
tick
for
me
might
cellar
some
and
come
back
to
it
but
right
now
it
just
pretty
averagesuper
strange
drinkability
is
wonderful
if
the
abv
werent
so
high
id
probably
drink
through
45
mouthfeel
is
good
with
the
carbonation
helping
to
bring
out
the
vanilla
in
particular
syrupy
coating
after
a
swallow
nice
as
well
to
go
with
the
sticky
texture
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
an
11
abv
beer
but
the
tastes
can
become
a
jumble
after
a
bit
one
single
of
this
guy
is
the
right
amount
decent
fairly
alcoholic
and
carbonated
probably
better
with
age
looking
forward
to
it
poured
from
12oz
bottle
2010
into
a
snifter
glass
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
half
finger
width
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
consisted
of
a
lot
of
booze
with
some
hops
malt
caramel
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
was
very
strong
at
the
beginning
and
then
rounded
out
well
at
the
end
i
was
blown
away
on
my
first
sip
with
the
amount
of
alcohol
character
that
it
had
as
it
warmed
i
started
to
taste
some
light
pleasant
hops
caramel
malt
and
maybe
some
toffee
so
much
going
on
medium
body
and
soso
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
old
world
barley
wine
ale
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
ill
definitely
need
to
pick
a
4pack
up
next
time
i
spot
one
to
see
how
this
beer
develops
over
the
years
d
ok
wow
this
would
definitely
be
a
bit
easier
to
drink
with
some
age
so
dont
crack
these
bad
boys
right
away
still
as
i
sip
it
gets
easier
yet
less
flavor
which
is
kind
of
sad
not
the
best
old
ale
i
ever
had
but
still
very
drinkable
may
buy
another
to
age
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
the
2010
vintage
the
beer
pours
a
vibrant
deep
amberred
coloring
with
no
head
heavy
smells
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hazelnut
with
a
slight
hint
of
sour
grapes
flavors
are
heavy
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
tones
also
there
are
roasted
characteristics
present
with
a
shift
to
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
sharp
and
carbonated
feel
in
mouth
initially
yet
has
a
full
and
syrupyviscous
feeling
throughout
the
mouth
there
is
a
spiced
and
slightly
sour
aftertaste
with
a
strong
nudge
of
the
booze
and
the
finish
is
viscous
and
stale
strong
flavors
and
alcohol
notes
make
this
a
sipper
and
only
one
or
two
per
sitting
for
me
but
tasty
nonetheless
for
12
5
drinkability
is
rather
high
kinda
scary
but
like
i
said
before
it
is
the
2008
vintage
i
honestly
havent
had
any
other
vintage
yet
but
i
cant
imagine
something
younger
being
better
a
very
respectable
beer
d
still
an
enjoyable
brew
even
without
any
years
on
it
really
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
this
4pack
once
a
year
going
forward
d
i
keep
reminiscing
of
belgian
tripels
and
quads
as
i
drink
it
the
sweet
raisiny
fruity
malt
just
takes
me
there
im
not
opposed
at
all
while
i
expect
a
beer
of
this
strength
to
be
nice
and
warming
the
alcohol
hit
me
about
half
way
through
the
first
glass
that
hinders
its
drinkability
a
bit
in
my
eyes
wow
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
nice
brandy
carbonated
beverage
it
was
as
if
i
were
taking
a
nice
snifter
of
brandy
with
a
cigar
but
it
was
a
cold
beer
this
is
not
a
guzzling
beer
but
a
nice
sipping
beer
for
a
night
where
1
or
max
2
will
give
you
the
buzz
you
need
with
a
ton
of
flavor
i
am
sorry
that
i
just
grabbed
one
of
these
as
i
was
doing
a
mixed
6
pack
of
things
to
try
it
was
great
i
dont
have
a
more
recent
one
to
compare
with
but
based
on
this
bottle
this
beer
seems
to
be
one
worth
aging
d
very
good
example
of
style
and
a
very
solid
beer
poured
from
12oz
bottle
at
54
degrees
smell
is
good
a
little
sweetness
then
follows
with
an
almost
scotch
aftertaste
not
quite
as
smooth
as
some
of
my
favorites
but
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
very
good
11
7
abv
is
quite
noticeable
up
front
maybe
a
little
too
much
overall
good
d
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
dangerously
high
in
comparison
to
the
abv
north
coast
has
proven
to
me
with
just
about
all
of
their
beers
that
they
are
a
very
knowledgeable
and
high
quality
brewery
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
sweet
and
boozy
maybe
i
would
like
this
better
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
as
is
i
will
pass
in
the
future
d
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
was
never
a
factor
in
the
overall
taste
the
abv
limits
this
one
but
a
two
year
old
treat
is
well
worth
the
wait
even
if
you
end
up
drinking
a
couple
of
bottles
d
midrange
the
booze
isnt
overwhelming
but
theres
not
much
to
assist
the
palate
im
gonna
hold
on
to
another
bottle
for
a
year
and
give
that
a
fair
shake
but
im
not
terribly
hopeful
really
i
think
theres
just
way
too
much
sugar
in
this
beer
for
it
to
work
it
comes
off
a
bit
too
syrupy
for
me
decent
nightcap
to
be
sure
but
there
are
ones
far
better
in
this
league
notes
it
had
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
drink
and
i
had
great
memories
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
revisit
it
but
must
confess
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
it
felt
a
bit
flat
during
most
of
the
experience
in
fact
it
even
felt
too
boozy
which
typically
is
not
a
problem
for
me
quite
the
contrary
i
typically
like
it
but
on
this
occasion
i
found
little
to
make
the
alcohol
presence
interesting
luckily
towards
the
end
on
the
last
pour
it
recuperated
some
of
the
tones
and
complexities
that
i
remembered
but
not
many
not
that
its
temperature
had
changed
so
much
but
at
least
it
ended
into
a
somewhat
higher
note
ill
try
to
cellar
the
rest
of
this
4pack
and
see
if
a
couple
of
years
have
a
good
effect
on
it
drink
if
only
i
had
a
few
several
shots
of
espresso
to
accompany
me
this
could
have
been
like
a
fourloko
night
its
tasty
to
sip
but
honestly
this
was
just
too
intense
for
me
to
drink
much
of
id
love
to
see
how
this
would
taste
mellowed
out
from
age
12
this
ale
rocks
love
this
beer
this
one
and
old
rasputin
from
north
coast
yummy
yummy
what
a
great
beer
to
conclude
this
bif
thanks
again
paul
ive
had
a
blast
now
some
people
say
old
ales
and
barleywines
walk
a
thin
line
this
is
definately
one
that
could
go
either
way
for
me
it
has
a
sharper
hop
presence
than
most
old
ales
yet
has
such
a
great
strong
malt
backbone
it
still
fits
nicely
in
as
a
old
ale
either
way
a
great
beer
i
reviewed
this
tonight
because
it
was
the
new
vintage
i
realized
i
had
never
reviewed
it
before
but
im
currently
setting
up
quite
a
vertical
that
i
will
replace
this
review
with
in
the
future
this
beer
is
pretty
hot
young
overall
this
is
a
hit
for
lovers
of
old
ale
and
maltforward
beers
in
general
must
find
more
to
age
and
drink
now
mouthfeel
is
sticky
syrupy
but
not
that
thick
just
enough
carbonation
to
move
it
over
your
tongue
barely
any
alcohol
taste
for
an
almost
12
abv
beer
very
impressive
overall
impression
this
will
keep
you
warm
in
the
winter
be
ready
for
bold
flavors
with
high
alcohol
reminiscent
of
a
whiskey
throat
feel
drinks
ok
for
the
style
fruity
sweet
syrupy
and
rich
but
very
tasty
pours
a
dark
orange
sort
of
red
color
with
no
lacing
smells
like
a
barleywine
to
me
when
i
take
a
sip
i
get
the
very
subtle
hints
of
alcohol
which
is
no
surprise
since
this
beer
has
a
11
5
abv
what
im
surprised
at
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
bite
i
get
the
flavor
right
off
the
back
when
i
sip
and
then
it
goes
away
leaving
very
little
mouth
feel
which
is
nice
with
11
5
abv
all
in
all
a
very
smooth
ale
from
a
great
brewery
i
had
the
2010
vintage
poured
amberbrown
color
sweet
malty
flavor
very
malty
in
fact
lots
of
molasses
on
the
nose
and
pallet
the
11
7
abv
is
apparent
and
could
be
overwhelming
to
some
medium
body
syrupy
brandy
flavors
dark
fruit
flavors
this
beer
would
be
remarkable
with
aging
pours
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
very
small
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
scent
is
very
barleywineish
dark
fruits
with
big
malt
backbone
the
alcohol
is
not
as
present
as
it
was
fresh
this
one
is
almost
a
year
old
taste
is
very
malty
with
some
very
tasty
dried
dark
fruit
flavors
i
get
prunes
raisins
and
dates
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
out
over
this
last
year
making
this
a
much
better
beer
mouthfeeel
is
not
too
syrupy
and
very
delightful
drinkability
is
fair
considering
the
abv
id
recommend
everyone
to
sit
on
this
beer
for
about
a
year
as
it
has
balanced
out
nicely
so
far
i
have
0810
in
the
cellar
would
really
like
to
add
a
bottle
from
earlier
to
do
a
nice
vertical
tasting
excellent
but
likely
on
the
decline
drink
now
if
youre
holding
d
although
11
5
abv
it
is
masked
well
by
the
flavor
it
is
still
present
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
expect
this
is
my
second
north
coast
review
and
i
have
been
impressed
so
far
this
is
a
good
beer
and
should
definitely
be
tried
if
ever
come
across
drinkability
decent
beer
but
not
nearly
as
full
bodied
and
complex
as
i
would
like
with
this
taste
fresh
in
my
mind
i
am
looking
forward
to
tasting
the
newly
released
bourbon
barrel
version
d
this
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
i
think
the
alcohol
content
is
hidden
pretty
well
also
this
is
exactly
what
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
when
i
bought
it
great
beer
i
think
ill
go
back
to
the
store
and
get
a
4pack
of
this
drinkability
to
be
such
a
strong
ale
i
find
this
incredibly
drinkable
you
know
its
good
when
you
are
a
little
bumbed
the
glass
is
about
empty
will
buy
more
to
cellar
d
i
enjoyed
one
bottle
and
couldve
had
a
second
easily
nice
complex
flavor
although
it
does
seem
a
bit
harsh
this
young
the
higher
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
and
only
sometimes
becomes
too
assertive
definitely
worth
a
revisit
in
a
year
after
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
has
chilled
out
a
bit
some
may
hesitate
to
purchase
with
a
four
pack
around
15
dollars
in
2010
but
at
this
price
for
the
quality
old
stock
is
a
great
bargain
just
hold
off
drinking
for
a
few
years
pours
a
honey
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
left
over
smells
of
caramel
toffee
and
tons
of
booze
tastes
of
caramel
toffee
malts
honey
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
medium
because
the
alcohol
is
so
upfront
drinkability
though
i
cant
speak
for
the
entire
2010
vintage
i
do
not
think
this
bottle
was
ready
yet
i
do
not
know
how
young
it
was
but
more
aging
would
have
i
suppose
done
it
well
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
my
first
goround
with
this
beer
but
it
wont
be
my
last
im
adding
this
one
to
my
favorite
winter
beers
list
an
enjoyable
sipper
overall
this
was
a
decent
big
beer
but
i
want
a
bit
more
out
of
it
its
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
mindblowingly
memorable
also
the
sour
notes
in
the
nose
and
taste
are
a
bit
confusing
is
that
intentional
d
wow
its
so
complex
in
flavor
between
woody
flavors
of
oak
spice
rum
chocolates
and
vanilla
however
it
is
so
strong
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
the
booze
burn
and
heaviness
of
the
beer
brings
it
down
a
notch
despite
is
flavor
profile
d
not
too
bad
i
like
this
one
out
of
the
bottle
better
i
think
if
it
was
on
co2
it
would
have
been
a
bit
better
still
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
d
i
dont
like
this
beer
as
much
as
many
of
my
friends
however
this
beer
is
complex
and
so
is
the
style
in
general
d
all
in
all
a
very
solid
old
ale
that
hides
that
11
5
well
mediumplus
bodied
beer
with
average
cabonation
pretty
drinkable
considering
its
strength
i
endorse
this
beer
the
evident
alcohol
makes
this
a
textbook
sipping
beer
ive
read
that
old
stock
is
not
meant
to
be
consumed
fresh
and
is
best
enjoyed
after
cellaring
for
a
year
or
so
well
i
can
see
why
ageing
is
suggested
although
i
had
no
problem
savouring
this
ale
its
a
bit
young
and
harsh
right
now
overall
its
still
a
very
good
brew
but
im
willing
to
bet
that
vintaged
versions
are
more
rewarding
than
this
fresh
new
bottle
beautiful
rich
color
light
brown
with
slight
red
tint
pours
with
a
shallow
dense
head
and
leaves
a
nice
persistent
foam
ring
around
the
snifter
has
both
a
sweet
smell
and
taste
seems
like
perhaps
there
isnt
enough
flavor
to
counteract
the
11
7
alcohol
there
is
sort
of
a
bite
after
every
sip
overall
still
a
very
good
beer
d
a
sipper
for
certain
love
how
this
beer
ages
just
so
much
better
than
fresh
sweetness
has
come
to
the
fore
a
little
bit
some
cocoa
toffee
fruit
bread
a
slightly
bitter
and
chewy
finish
which
leans
on
some
roasted
barley
a
hint
of
earth
and
a
generous
dash
of
alcohol
that
never
comes
off
as
astringent
or
burning
drinking
like
a
fine
port
or
similar
this
is
just
an
awesome
evening
treat
light
to
medium
carbonation
not
too
chewy
but
creamy
mouthfeel
warming
all
the
way
down
delightful
2007
vintage
old
stock
indeed
it
pours
a
murky
dark
apple
cider
topped
by
a
very
minor
spritz
of
dirty
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuits
caramel
chocolate
graham
crackers
ginger
and
a
well
o
fusels
deep
in
the
back
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
peel
slight
pine
buttery
toffee
light
cocoa
and
a
decidedly
noticeable
alcohol
burn
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
chunky
feel
overall
i
think
age
has
done
some
good
for
this
brew
remembering
way
back
to
my
fresh
bottle
a
year
or
so
ago
but
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
much
of
this
at
once
2007
vintage
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
very
viscous
lighter
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
this
beer
smells
rather
pleasant
it
smells
of
grandmas
candy
jar
with
lots
of
butterscotch
some
orange
and
a
hint
of
grassy
notes
in
there
the
flavor
is
straight
up
butterscotch
to
the
point
where
it
seems
as
if
there
is
a
worthers
in
my
mouth
right
now
there
is
the
obvious
background
liquor
flavor
that
is
to
be
found
with
this
abv
but
its
not
too
strong
the
vapor
from
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
strong
to
give
it
too
high
a
rating
on
the
mouth
feel
but
otherwise
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
good
beer
to
drink
this
stuff
is
wonderful
if
a
bit
harsh
when
its
fresh
but
after
about
3
5
years
it
is
unbelievably
mellow
everything
settles
down
and
blends
together
leaving
the
individual
flavors
less
pronounced
and
more
as
part
of
a
whole
an
absolutely
excellent
choice
for
cellaring
im
going
to
make
it
a
regular
part
of
my
collection
for
such
a
high
abv
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
ive
tried
this
with
some
age
and
am
surprised
at
how
smooth
this
is
even
fresh
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
maybe
with
some
age
this
one
becomes
more
mellow
quite
sweet
and
a
definite
sipper
there
was
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
going
on
that
will
probably
better
integrate
with
time
but
the
sweetness
was
a
little
overpowering
when
tasted
fresh
dark
brownish
raspberry
color
head
at
pour
fades
to
a
nice
tan
ring
around
edge
of
glass
musty
aroma
with
some
sourness
as
it
warms
aroma
dominated
by
dark
somewhat
fruity
raisininess
alcohol
smell
moderate
carbonation
dark
fruits
come
through
on
beginning
of
drink
followed
by
warming
alcohol
feel
slight
burning
on
the
finish
to
be
expected
for
an
11
5
beer
almost
mediciny
aftertaste
great
start
slightly
lesser
finish
but
good
for
the
style
really
enjoyed
this
beer
was
recommended
to
me
after
mentioning
i
liked
barleywines
much
less
boozy
than
barleywines
that
i
have
tried
and
very
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
light
mahogany
color
with
very
little
head
the
nose
is
mostly
of
alcohol
almost
a
brandy
like
scent
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
the
flavors
are
a
creamy
brandy
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
oak
and
a
somewhat
heavy
alcohol
finish
even
with
the
high
alcohol
levels
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
drink
and
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
d
good
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
because
just
lacked
unique
character
and
depth
this
beer
pours
a
really
nice
deep
red
color
clear
with
a
decent
head
which
fades
to
nothing
pretty
fast
aroma
is
low
but
smells
of
liqour
soaked
raisins
and
rich
malts
with
burnt
caramel
caramel
rich
toffee
and
more
currant
and

in
the
flavor
bready
malts
slightly
sharp
and
alcoholic
mouthfeel
is
slick
kinda
oily
but
really
hot
from
the
alcohol
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
much
of
this
stuff
but
its
good
interested
in
having
one
with
some
age

it

vt
notes
this
is
a
great
old
ale
i
would
love
to
sit
by
a
fireplace
and
sip
on
this
in
the
dead
of
winter
this
would
probably
be
excellent
with
even
more
age
on
it
impression
good
looking
forward
to
letting
the
other
bottles
age
and
sharing
with
a
friend
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle2008
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
the
pour
is
deep
gold
with
a
solid
2
inch
white
head
lots
of
booze
and
toffee
on
the
nose
the
flavor
has
lots
of
toffee
vanilla
and
a
very
heavy
booze
prescence
it
has
a
hot
alcohol
finish
it
has
a
full
body
a
suprising
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
very
boozey
feel
to
it
a
great
sipper

bauermj
verdict
old
stock
is
a
brilliant
brew
and
has
totally
lived
up
to
its
lofty
reputation
so
far
part
barleywine
part
old
ale
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
big
beer
making
such
a
great
impression
while
fresh
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
evolves
over
the
years
pours
a
deep
dark
redamber
color
with
a
very
slight
tannish
head
smells
are
caramel
malts
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
molasses
tastes
are
caramel
some
prunes
yeast
alcohol
and
some
raisins
mouthfeel
is
kinda
chewy
with
just
a
little
carbonation
as
for
drinkability
even
though
this
js
mellowed
a
bit
its
still
a
sipper
ruby
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
head
that
disappeared
rapidly
the
smell
is
rich
fruit
maybe
ripe
fruit
maybe
cherry
would
be
what
im
trying
to
describe
the
taste
is
great
the
flavor
is
complex
with
rich
raisin
and
caramel
flavors
that
arent
overwhelming
the
aftertaste
lingers
and
helps
add
to
the
flavor
yet
again
it
is
subtle
and
not
overwhelming
the
beer
is
too
strong
to
drink
more
than
one
and
does
have
an
alcohol
bite
to
it
overall
this
is
delicious
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
d
this
is
quite
a
nice
old
ale
perhaps
one
of
the
better
ive
had
from
this
side
of
the
pond
ill
enjoy
laying
a
couple
of
these
down
for
a
special
occasion
has
picked
this
up
earlier
this
year
and
let
it
age
a
while
but
a
streak
of
cold
rainy
weather
broke
my
willpower
to
age
this
one
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
a
nice
brownish
red
really
sweet
smelling
lots
of
big
malts
this
one
is
boozey
warms
you
up
as
it
goes
down
this
one
definitely
gets
better
with
age
one
is
enough
as
this
one
could
kick
your
arse
mine
said
12
5
abv
on
the
bottle
not
sure
who
is
right
its
already
good
no
doubt
about
it
but
give
it
a
few
years
and
it
will
be
amazing
will
match
perfect
with
cheeses
tastelow
carbonation
plummy
spicy
malt
lots
of
warming
alcohol
fullbodied
and
complex
this
is
a
slowsipper
to
be
sure
full
bodied
low
carbonation
chewy
and
very
sweet
bordering
on
syrupy
a
good
beer
which
might
be
much
better
if
it
aged
a
few
years
2009
vintage
this
is
a
less
hoppy
and
american
version
of
fullers
vintage
ale
i
suspect
this
will
be
a
master
piece
with
age
sadly
i
have
one
bottle
so
i
wont
see
what
age
does
here
i
truly
think
this
might
be
5
worthy
with
age
but
for
now
well
my
score
stands
d
ing
awesome
seriously
tasty
tasty
old
beer
look
forward
to
seeing
how
this
stands
up
to
a
spin
in
the
cellar
d
this
isnt
a
little
beer
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
the
sweetness
helps
it
go
down
pretty
easy
for
me
lots
of
complex
aromas
and
tastes
going
on
with
this
beer
this
is
a
truly
delicous
beer
fresh
interested
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
i
dont
remember
how
much
i
paid
for
this
single
bottle
it
wasnt
that
much
though
less
than
rasputin
but
more
than
most
beers
its
good
and
i
could
probably
see
myself
in
the
future
namely
winter
picking
up
another
bottle
or
so
of
this
o
much
better
on
tap
solid
complex
and
heavy
beautiful
malt
profile
amazing
great
fruit
i
didnt
remember
this
beer
being
anywhere
near
this
good
d
i
want
to
say
at
11
5
abv
you
shouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
if
you
get
a
few
vintage
bottles
of
this
beer
i
suggest
enjoying
as
many
as
you
can
appreciate
the
flavors
have
held
up
very
well
and
the
body
is
exceptionally
smooth
drinking
this
beer
is
as
nice
as
having
a
ripe
piece
of
fruit
also
the
alcohol
isnt
really
overpowering
this
beer
really
lived
up
to
the
hype
conclusion
as
a
fresh
beer
this
doesnt
work
too
well
i
will
gladly
put
a
couple
in
the
cellar
however
and
see
what
a
little
bit
of
time
does
to
it
d
with
the
alcohol
this
well
hidden
and
this
brew
being
as
smooth
as
it
is
this
makes
this
one
lethal
the
two
years
has
done
this
beer
wonders
wonderfully
balanced
and
the
alcohol
has
completely
disappeared
pours
a
muddy
red
with
some
offwhite
head
smells
of
cherries
booze
earth
flavors
of
vague
cherries
booze
some
earth
molasses
and
some
more
sugary
syrup
medium
bodied
with
with
almost
no
carbonation
on
the
palate
a
boozy
drink
that
still
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
i
am
really
enjoying
this
bad
boy
very
nice
sipper
of
a
beer
loving
the
flavor
it
offers
i
am
actually
building
a
vertical
of
old
stock
to
hold
onto
for
both
of
my
sons
starting
with
the
year
they
were
born
i
think
they
are
in
for
a
real
treat
old
stock
is
a
great
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
malt
bomb
im
curious
how
this
would
taste
aged
but
its
damn
good
fresh
it
hides
that
huge
abv
pretty
well
also
overall
a
good
brew
for
sure
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
a
very
tasty
treat
that
would
probably
mellow
out
very
well
with
a
little
age
on
it
its
still
a
little
hot
but
i
can
imagine
the
2007
is
drinking
superbly
right
now
if
i
had
known
the
2007
was
waiting
for
me
id
have
saved
the
2009
and
done
a
sidebyside
ill
have
to
try
to
score
another
young
bottle
for
a
comparison
next
time
im
at
home
thanks
for
hooking
me
up
gents
a
very
nice
maltforward
ale
my
first
offering
of
the
style
and
from
north
coast
though
ill
be
pursuing
more
of
both
in
the
future
drinkability
overall
this
beer
is
very
sweet
and
leaves
that
licorice
after
taste
in
the
mouth
for
a
long
time
if
you
like
icorice
youll
like
this
beer
drinkability
it
is
a
great
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
in
the
winter
instead
of
the
summer
heat
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
could
not
chug
it
even
if
i
wanted
to
i
dont
think
its
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
satisfying
brew
nonetheless
my
only
valid
complaint
is
the
lack
of
a
solid
character
its
quite
easy
to
drink
two
of
these
at
the
end
of
the
day
any
more
would
lead
to
an
evening
of
unpleasantness
from
this
lightweight
overall
excellent
beer
overall
this
would
make
a
great
winter
warmer
for
those
not
familiar
with
the
style
i
suggest
checking
it
out
you
wont
regret
it
it
accompanies
a
serious
attitude
with
a
satisfaction
that
i
have
experienced
in
very
few
beers
with
a
slight
warming
to
perhaps
50
deg
you
will
be
enthralled
with
a
complex
yet
piercing
bite
that
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
beer
after
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
complexities
of
beer
after
dinner
with
a
very
ripe
cheese
this
works
well
for
me
all
around
a
super
nice
old
ale
that
should
be
tried
dnot
the
best
old
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
still
good
i
can
see
letting
some
of
these
sit
a
little
longer
to
let
smooth
out
and
let
the
flavors
complex
and
grow
a
little
more
overall
very
tasty
beer
i
could
imagine
being
very
happy
with
2
or
3
of
these
on
a
cold
night
food
pairing
date
tres
leches
cake
with
polencio
syrup
this
is
a
sipper
not
a
chugger
end
fingers
worth
of
deep
tan
foam
moderate
sized
bubbles
quick
to
evacuate
and
simmer
down
to
the
surface
equally
weak
retention
to
what
lacing
does
appear
thick
close
to
viscous
appearance
like
orange
clay
mud
in
a
glass
the
brackish
look
gives
way
to
some
yellow
at
the
outermost
edges
smells
almost
like
a
bakery
or
candy
store
avalanche
of
caramel
toffee
butterscotch
milk
chocolate
molasses
pralines
cinnamon
bourbon
before
prune
date
fig
and
dried
peach
scents
ensue
with
a
slice
of
raisin
bread
too
nothing
hoppy
or
even
really
funky
fullbodied
with
surprisingly
good
fluidity
given
the
voluptuousness
of
the
nose
the
carbonation
tightly
woven
yet
not
smothered
in
this
environment
here
theres
a
peat
moss
charcoal
ash
and
unprocessed
grains
element
to
balance
at
least
in
part
the
molasses
honey
butterscotch
milk
chocolate
vanilla
fudge
and
date
fig
raisin
fruit
plus
theres
a
nice
glancing
blow
of
orange
lemon
citrus
to
lend
zest
creates
more
inner
mouth
perfume
than
youd
expect
too
no
session
beer
but
great
to
finish
off
the
evening
with
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
despite
the
heavy
alcohol
content
which
is
negated
through
the
balanced
malty
sweetness
drinkability
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
ever
had
but
a
solid
beer
overall
final
notes
this
would
make
a
great
beer
to
sip
by
the
fireplace
or
campfire
in
the
wintertime
or
to
pair
with
a
dessert
warming
and
deliciously
sweet
but
you
must
treat
it
with
respect
im
seriously
dissapointed
in
this
beer
from
a
pretty
darn
good
brewery
unless
im
going
crazy
this
is
not
the
same
beer
i
tried
in
2009
the
mouthfeel
is
lowly
attenuated
with
a
good
maybe
even
slightly
high
level
of
carbonation
its
fitting
but
doesnt
elevate
the
beer
any
the
drinkability
on
this
is
about
average
its
high
abv
and
a
slow
sipper
but
i
found
myself
losing
interest
towards
the
end
drinkability
still
the12
alcohol
bomb
that
demands
sipping
delicious
but
not
so
much
that
you
can
pound
these
past
the
point
of
caution
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
were
very
good
ill
definitely
get
more
of
this
one
for
those
cool
fall
nights
this
has
a
powerfully
sweet
taste
for
11
5
i
didnt
taste
the
alcohol
as
much
as
i
expected
but
now
1015
minutes
after
finishing
it
i
feel
flushed
like
i
just
took
a
double
shot
of
whiskey
its
pretty
smooth
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
is
a
good
beer
overall
i
just
wasnt
prepared
for
it
this
would
be
better
with
a
meal
or
just
after
eating
not
one
to
drink
quickly
or
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
at
a
time
d
a
decent
dark
ale
but
i
thought
it
smelled
and
tasted
too
sweet
and
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
too
prevelant
in
the
taste
might
give
another
shot
d
not
drinkable
at
all
if
you
can
drink
one
of
these
youre
lucky
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
this
is
a
very
interesting
style
of
beer
that
i
have
yet
to
taste
id
like
to
try
another
in
the
style
cool
drinkability
damn
this
is
a
sipper
i
attempted
to
quaff
a
bit
of
this
and
it
did
not
work
heh
quite
a
solid
old
ale
very
nice
glad
i
got
this
as
a
single
this
is
going
down
easier
than
anticipated
it
is
going
to
kick
my
ass
too
11
is
no
joke
i
could
have
one
more
and
that
would
be
it
tasty
and
probably
better
as
a
winter
sipper
still
a
must
try
very
good
as
a
last
note
if
youre
into
doppelbocks
or
stronger
abbey
ales
im
sure
this
beer
is
right
up
your
alley
i
just
personally
dont
care
for
a
ton
of
dark
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
in
my
beer
db
price
good
for
the
abv
and
taste
the
fruit
roasty
and
barleywine
notes
are
great
and
the
aged
version
is
very
nice
glad
i
have
a
good
amount
of
bottles
to
age
hard
to
take
much
at
once
but
still
enjoyable
gave
this
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
to
see
if
i
could
come
up
with
any
head
due
to
the
11
5
abv
success
about
a
finger
of
head
that
looks
just
like
cappuccino
foam
it
was
short
lived
an
quickly
resided
into
spotty
lacing
all
in
all
though
this
amber
colored
beer
looks
great
with
tiny
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
when
i
cram
my
nose
into
my
glass
i
immediately
get
sucker
punched
with
a
fist
full
of
alcohol
this
was
not
unexpected
after
the
first
whiff
of
getting
over
the
alcohol
burn
layers
of
toffee
and
caramel
come
to
fruition
with
a
faint
hint
of
brandy
in
the
background
this
syrupy
beer
is
very
warming
with
comforting
flavors
once
again
toffee
and
caramel
come
to
mind
with
a
bit
of
fruit
particularly
plumbs
roasted
malts
everywhere
the
finish
does
leave
a
lingering
taste
of
alcohol
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
which
feel
good
in
the
mouth
a
bit
syrupy
and
the
alcohol
is
warm
going
down
but
nothing
i
wouldnt
love
on
a
chilly
winter
evening
the
light
carbonation
very
much
helps
bring
all
the
flavors
to
life
certainly
a
sipper
but
as
this
comforting
beer
can
be
enjoyed
on
the
best
of
quiet
evenings
smells
like
peach
cobbler
to
me
can
smell
the
booze
immediately
incredibly
hot
like
drinking
cherry
cough
syrup
trying
to
get
past
the
ethanol
i
get
a
bit
of
butterscotch
fruitcake
red
grape
flavor
hops
are
nonexistant
definitely
one
for
the
cellar
or
closet
in
my
case
i
havent
tried
this
stuff
fresh
but
looking
at
the
reviews
i
wouldnt
touch
this
stuff
for
at
least
a
year
at
two
years
old
this
is
some
serious
beer
if
youre
buying
some
new
bottles
just
stash
them
somewhere
and
forget
about
them
i
could
imagine
this
aging
for
a
good
long
while
i
would
love
to
have
a
bunch
of
this
sitting
in
my
imaginary
cellar
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
decent
initial
khaki
head
which
quickly
recedes
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
apples
dark
fruits
and
vintage
port
very
vinuous
on
the
palate
with
spicy
raisins
juicy
apples
apricots
and
alcohol
a
very
complex
and
enjoyable
barleywineold
ale
first
sip
and
theres
already
a
lot
of
different
levels
of
flavors
coming
out
a
smooth
buttery
caramel
steps
up
first
softening
up
the
tastebuds
next
comes
a
finely
aged
quality
port
wine
likeness
that
is
just
as
quickly
followed
by
either
something
that
reminds
me
of
cherries
or
green
apples
its
hard
pinpointing
which
exactly
i
had
my
better
half
take
a
sip
as
to
see
if
she
could
tell
which
and
shes
torn
between
the
two
as
well
the
finish
has
a
little
bit
of
hotness
from
the
high
alcohol
count
but
is
mellowed
out
by
vanilla
and
more
of
that
caramel
taste
that
it
had
in
the
beginning
d
i
feel
bad
review
this
beer
so
fresh
this
will
be
better
in
a
year
or
two
right
now
its
just
too
hot
flavors
are
rich
enough
though
will
try
this
again
after
some
ageing
and
probably
give
it
a
higher
score
d
not
the
best
of
the
old
ales
that
ive
come
across
perhaps
i
need
to
try
this
one
at
varying
ages
to
see
how
it
might
differ
edit
10
months
later
the
booziness
has
improved
remarkably
still
not
my
favorite
but
id
bump
this
to
a
bb
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
not
as
good
as
expected
for
an
old
ale
ive
been
getting
into
old
ales
like
hardy
lately
good
to
try
at
least
once
if
you
have
access
but
dont
bother
hunting
this
brew
i
recommend
that
old
stock
ale
be
drunk
as
a
first
beer
when
the
palette
is
clean
and
the
mind
is
clear
afterwards
you
can
drink
a
regular
ale
and
think
you
got
a
coors
light
by
mistake
this
is
one
fine
ale
albeit
a
bit
strong
north
coast
succeeds
again
enjoyable
but
not
sustainable
thought
it
would
go
nice
with
the
bbq
pulled
pork
sandwich
i
ordered
and
it
just
made
the
grade
a
lot
of
high
alcohol
brews
like
this
will
be
all
ethanol
when
paired
with
sweet
smoky
meat
the
intriguing
and
intoxicating
flavor
of
osa
however
luckily
held
firm
it
packs
a
and
resembles
a
refined
hard
fruit
punch
d
it
definitely
takes
a
hit
here
this
one
defines
a
sipper
if
there
was
a
definition
a
very
rich
flavorful
beer
it
is
very
tasty
and
easily
aquired
for
a
decent
price
so
it
could
be
a
regular
nightcap
beer
and
one
that
ages
gracefully
d
i
really
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
other
than
good
mentions
of
this
brew
a
really
solid
old
ale
w
substantial
malt
body
what
this
style
is
all
about
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
a
brew
upwards
of
11
abv
d
while
not
a
bad
beer
this
isnt
very
interesting
right
now
ive
got
a
4
pack
left
for
the
cellar
so
ill
pull
one
of
these
out
in
a
couple
of
years
to
see
if
aging
helps
develop
some
of
the
characteristics
very
sugary
sweet
fruit
flavor
and
thats
about
it
wasnt
extremely
enjoyable
and
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
one
out
any
time
soon
i
might
age
the
one
i
have
left
to
see
if
i
drank
it
to
soon
this
is
a
great
beer
for
one
and
done
possibly
even
two
but
no
more
super
sweet
malty
barleywine
feeling
beer
im
gonna
keep
this
one
in
the
back
of
my
head
for
another
time
north
coast
hits
another
home
run
poured
into
a
chouffe
snifter
head
pours
creamy
but
thin
and
dissipates
quick
enough
that
i
turned
my
head
for
a
moment
and
it
was
gone
beautiful
and
caramel
colored
in
the
glass
you
know
that
the
flavor
contained
within
is
aching
to
be
drank
no
light
passes
through
the
bulb
of
the
glass
as
it
sits
there
mini
bubbles
trickle
to
the
top
while
i
give
myself
time
between
sips
flavor
reminds
me
of
bourbon
and
fig
with
a
thick
oily
finish
to
it
high
alcohol
with
a
soft
and
subtlely
bitter
finish
a
wonderful
beer
d
this
needs
some
age
the
taste
while
complex
and
interesting
is
a
little
on
the
hot
side
look
forward
to
this
in
a
year
or
two
d
in
the
2009
and
and
2010
cases
i
just
drank
one
of
the
fourpack
to
evaluate
it
and
then
put
the
rest
aside
for
aging
i
expect
it
to
be
phenomenal
in
a
couple
of
years
well
see
this
is
a
remarkably
smooth
drinker
it
reminds
me
of
cognac
in
flavor
with
the
alcohol
being
well
blended
into
the
sweet
flavor
the
slightly
fuzzy
feeling
is
quite
enjoyable
not
a
bad
sipping
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
ive
been
digging
old
ales
as
of
late
and
had
high
expectations
as
north
coast
makes
several
incredible
beers
id
much
rather
go
with
a
bells
third
coast
if
im
in
the
mood
for
this
style
that
being
said
my
wife
took
a
couple
of
sips
from
my
snifter
hijacked
the
last
four
or
five
ounces
and
went
on
to
proclaim
this
as
one
of
her
top
five
beers
period
to
each
herhis
own
cheers
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
clear
red
with
some
foam
forming
in
the
duvel
tulip
glass
the
taste
is
of
sugary
dark
fruits
and
it
goes
down
so
damn
smooth
i
picked
up
no
hint
of
the
11
50
alc
at
all
wishing
i
picked
up
more
then
two
bottles
of
this
stuff
very
damn
good
beer
good
high
abv
and
overall
character
make
it
sippable
without
being
highly
drinkable
good
to
have
around
to
sip
and
age
as
you
can
a
few
years
on
a
bottle
seems
to
bring
it
to
near
ideal
conditions
deepening
filling
and
rounding
a
little
as
it
goes
overall
this
is
pretty
awesome
in
my
opinion
it
makes
me
think
of
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
with
its
flavor
character
the
cherry
and
raisin
makes
it
seem
belgian
but
there
is
absolutely
zero
sourness
quite
drinkable
considering
the
abv
quite
nice
and
interesting
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
booze
is
still
present
in
this
one
i
would
sit
on
this
another
year
and
would
expect
it
drinks
incredibly
then
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
color
with
an
off
white
creamy
head
nose
is
full
of
caramel
notes
maltiness
and
suggestions
of
oak
and
vanilla
mostly
sweet
aroma
is
strikingly
similar
to
cotton
candy
and
floral
hops
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
vanilla
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
blend
with
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
and
some
faint
astringency
medium
feel
and
mild
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
one
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
ale
absoslutely
an
unexpected
awesome
surprise
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkable
it
is
boy
breathe
overall
quite
an
experience
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
not
a
loser
drink
with
respect
2008
bottle
damn
this
thing
was
the
worst
gusher
ive
had
foam
poured
out
instantly
and
wouldnt
stop
for
about
10
seconds
luckily
saved
a
bit
with
my
mouth
and
the
glass
lost
a
couple
ounces
though
shucks
this
is
my
first
old
ale
pours
nearly
black
but
holding
it
up
to
the
light
reveals
seethrough
dark
red
very
carbonated
and
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
nice
head
rests
on
top
color
somewhere
between
offwhite
and
tan
eventually
just
turns
into
a
thick
ring
not
leaving
much
lacing
for
the
smell
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
doppelbock
cola
maple
burnt
toast
vanilla
quite
a
great
scent
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
getting
alot
of
cola
unsweetened
maple
dark
malt
a
whiskeyish
feel
probably
a
combination
of
vanillabooze
the
alcohol
comes
through
much
more
in
the
taste
than
in
the
scent
but
it
is
not
overly
boozy
for
12
5
caramel
and
smoke
also
come
to
mind
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
scotch
ale
and
a
doppelbock
pretty
complex
stuff
although
i
think
i
prefer
smelling
these
flavors
rather
than
tasting
them
a
little
too
heavy
and
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
tastes
this
has
been
aged
for
around
2
years
i
imagine
the
booze
on
this
thing
fresh
must
be
pretty
crazy
taste
actually
improves
a
bit
in
the
finish
i
think
a
warming
sweet
vanilla
flavor
seems
to
take
over
mouthfeel
is
good
nothing
really
mentionable
here
definitely
malts
over
hops
the
aging
has
had
a
part
in
this
im
sure
drinkability
is
pretty
limited
here
simply
because
of
the
nature
of
the
style
the
price
and
booze
taste
isnt
high
considering
the
alcohol
content
i
was
considering
buying
a
4pack
of
the
2008
to
age
but
i
think
i
will
pass
on
it
good
just
seems
like
the
flavors
here
are
a
bit
too
powerful
for
my
taste
i
still
wouldnt
mind
trying
the
reserve
though
anyone
wanna
give
it
up
p
give
it
a
shot
a
decadent
beer
and
one
that
ill
definitely
seek
out
again
old
ales
are
quickly
moving
up
the
rankings
in
my
list
of
favorite
styles
drinkability
at
this
current
point
at
least
in
this
beers
life
i
have
to
be
realistic
and
admits
its
drinkablity
is
fairly
low
theres
just
to
much
heat
and
not
a
great
balance
i
would
be
intrigued
to
see
how
this
balances
out
in
a
couple
year
time
but
i
think
this
is
one
if
i
had
a
4pack
of
id
certainly
be
cellaring
for
bit
drinkability
definitely
not
for
up
and
about
type
activity
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
nice
easy
bring
down
at
the
abv
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
my
uncle
who
likes
port
wine
might
be
into
this
not
my
thing
but
no
denying
these
guys
make
fantastic
beers
its
funny
how
all
of
these
winterholiday
beers
have
been
all
over
the
market
when
this
beer
is
probably
my
favorite
winter
beer
its
just
perfect
to
sip
on
a
cold
winters
night
by
the
fire
dthis
is
pretty
tasty
it
is
a
little
boozy
taking
away
from
the
overall
drinkability
but
i
can
imagine
that
this
really
opens
up
with
some
age
definitely
decent
fresh
but
im
sure
age
will
make
this
awesome
well
done
i
will
drink
this
again
d
very
drinkable
for
an
11
5
beer
but
the
alcohol
will
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
4
5
even
with
the
high
alcohol
content
you
really
can
not
tell
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
nicely
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
nice
whiskey
on
a
warm
day
md
bubbly
in
mouth
and
somewhat
harsh
on
finish
although
at
11
5
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
not
overly
drinkable
and
honestly
this
brew
is
a
big
disappointment
overall
great
beer
i
will
be
seeking
more
of
dont
take
this
one
lightly
sip
and
enjoy
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
and
glad
i
picked
it
up
i
would
recommend
it
unless
you
go
to
the
same
beer
stores
i
do
the
2012
has
a
ruby
hue
more
clear
than
the
2009
2012s
aroma
compares
nicely
to
the
2009
not
quite
as
complex
flavor
is
quite
different
ripe
apple
caramel
dates
toffee
brown
sugar
a
little
bit
more
heat
on
my
tongue
but
still
pleasantly
smooth
wow
this
one
just
gets
better
and
better
as
you
let
it
set
in
the
glass
aone
brew
d
a
deep
sipper
to
be
sure
but
full
of
flavors
too
complex
to
detail
here
because
i
would
really
only
be
doing
this
beer
a
disservice
this
beer
would
make
an
excellent
addition
to
the
cellar
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
develops
over
time
overall
i
have
had
this
many
times
and
am
never
disappointed
i
recently
had
an
05
vintage
and
that
was
amazing
as
well
a
great
beer
to
cellar
at
the
right
temperature
waiting
to
consume
is
the
problem
this
beer
reminds
me
of
an
oaky
tripel
a
11
7
that
sips
like
a
79er
this
beer
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
last
years
was
good
this
ones
great
d
pretty
warming
beer
at
11
7
one
and
done
for
me
this
is
probably
better
with
age
conclusion
too
sweet
for
my
general
tastes
but
when
it
comes
to
big
malty
sipping
brews
this
is
a
good
one
to
keep
around
raisin
and
caramel
mix
without
being
overly
sweet
this
one
ale
would
get
me
through
the
coldest
winter
and
would
be
one
of
my
two
creations
to
retain
in
the
hypothetical
world
of
only
being
allowed
two
different
beers
the
other
being
to
balance
things
out
deschutes
esb
poured
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
frothy
beigetan
head
lots
of
carbonation
sticking
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
is
of
very
strong
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
strong
mostly
alcohol
with
dark
fruit
and
lots
of
sweet
sweet
malt
brown
sugary
sweet
nice
hints
of
raisin
and
apples
i
dunno
if
i
held
on
to
this
too
long
or
what
but
the
hops
are
way
too
mellowed
out
they
are
supposed
to
be
there
right
this
needs
balance
feel
is
slightly
syrupy
and
coating
this
is
not
drinkable
too
sweet
and
cloying
d
overall
a
very
good
beer
surprisingly
since
i
dont
enjoy
very
very
sweet
beers
at
11
5
the
abv
is
a
bit
much
this
was
damn
good
but
i
have
to
say
there
are
a
lot
of
10
beers
that
i
could
drink
all
night
this
isnt
one
of
them
i
know
its
slightly
stronger
but
that
isnt
the
reason
simply
put
a
single
bottle
is
very
drinkable
more
probably
wouldnt
be
old
stock
is
a
terrific
ale
that
would
be
a
pleasure
to
sip
with
or
after
dinner
or
slowly
with
a
book
in
a
dark
quiet
place
its
exactly
as
an
ale
should
feel
drinkability
decent
beer
but
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
ill
be
aging
another
though
would
probably
go
well
with
some
apple
pie
delightfully
dry
mouthfeel
wit
a
winey
aftertaste
very
good
beer
overall
d
not
overwhelming
in
flavor
but
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
d
dangerously
drinkable
for
an
11
5
old
ale
not
too
sweet
or
cloying
and
the
alcohol
really
begins
to
mask
itself
after
a
few
minutes
of
exposure
d
this
is
already
quite
good
really
a
sipper
right
now
i
can
see
57
years
of
aging
could
turn
this
into
something
phenomenal
id
love
to
sample
a
bottle
in
2015
wow
taste
is
really
complex
nice
hint
of
sweetness
a
bit
boozy
age
this
sucker
as
long
as
you
can
drinkability
is
a
bit
low
due
to
booziness
i
had
to
adjust
today
the
more
i
tried
to
drink
the
less
i
liked
it
never
had
the
style
before
so
i
could
chalk
it
up
to
that
that
being
said
i
am
usually
pretty
easy
to
please
and
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
low
drinkability
was
the
hardest
for
me
to
do
sometimes
i
feel
that
score
does
not
fit
right
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
doubt
i
will
buy
this
again
d
this
beer
is
great
but
the
high
abv
steers
me
away
frommore
than
just
a
bottle
alcohol
content
isnt
always
an
issue
with
me
but
the
sting
in
this
beer
keeps
reminding
me
of
its
guilty
pleasure
d
the
high
alcohol
is
detectable
but
its
quite
easy
going
down
anyway
flavors
work
well
together
but
could
be
a
bit
more
foreward
d
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
some
from
09
and
the
stock
ale
reserve
2009
vintage
this
is
powerful
stuff
after
an
agressive
pour
the
minimal
head
that
formed
receeded
to
the
thin
ring
encircling
the
inside
of
the
glass
smells
almost
like
southern
comfort
i
definetely
can
tell
that
this
is
a
hangover
waiting
to
happen
hopefully
i
wont
get
punched
out
by
mike
tyson
hot
astringent
extremely
boozy
not
unlike
young
bourbon
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
would
have
liked
some
more
carbonation
on
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
cough
syrup
like
it
literally
coated
my
teeth
overall
verdict
its
not
ready
and
luckily
i
still
have
three
bottles
i
can
put
back
for
a
year
or
2
hopefully
they
will
mellow
and
be
more
enjoyable
then
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
but
not
too
hard
to
put
down
fresh
i
cant
wait
to
see
waht
some
age
does
to
it
full
syrupy
body
low
carbonation
level
very
very
smooth
drinker
still
a
tad
hot
which
is
to
be
expected
but
it
could
still
use
a
little
more
time
ill
definitely
be
picking
more
of
these
up
id
love
to
try
a
bottle
thats
5
years
old
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
only
just
one
other
i
recommend
this
to
those
who
want
to
try
a
complex
old
ale
that
has
a
nice
alcohol
profile
that
isnt
overwhelming
pours
a
brownamber
color
with
a
tan
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
dark
fruits
and
molasses
malty
alcoholic
flavor
that
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
some
vanilla
and
wood
flavors
in
there
too
great
mouthfeel
mediumfull
bodied
not
too
syrupy
this
is
very
boozy
yet
still
very
drinkable
good
stuff
d
pleasent
flavor
that
doesnt
wear
the
palate
sure
the
alcohol
presence
is
strong
but
for
such
a
high
abv
it
is
just
right
pours
a
brown
body
with
minimal
head
that
has
a
strong
malt
smell
of
roasted
and
caramel
malts
along
with
some
oily
a
real
strong
ale
with
a
sturdy
malt
base
caramel
toffee
roasted
malts
along
with
some
woodiness
as
well
as
small
amounts
of
dark
chocolate
also
tads
of
dark
fruit
cherry
and
some
herbal
hoppy
leafiness
great
balance
with
this
beer
with
sweetness
and
a
tad
dryness
in
backbite
with
fruit
and
abv
for
a
crisp
finish
great
sipper
that
warms
as
up
as
you
keep
sipping
on
it
d
the
paragon
of
the
style
a
must
have
for
fans
of
the
style
as
well
as
something
to
look
in
to
for
fans
of
dipas
riss
and
barleywines
worth
seeking
out
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
it
takes
a
while
to
quaff
like
a
good
wine
only
thicker
a
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
but
with
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
feel
this
beer
is
actually
rather
drinkable
for
its
11
5
abv
it
is
definitely
better
to
drink
warm
it
becomes
more
balanced
and
complex
it
could
however
stand
to
mellow
out
a
bit
from
the
alcohol
warmth
and
the
heavy
malts
im
looking
forward
to
try
this
aged
for
a
couple
years
i
only
have
one
extra
right
now
but
ill
be
sure
to
pick
more
up
so
that
i
can
age
some
for
a
while
somehow
this
beer
is
sweet
without
being
too
sweet
its
dessert
in
a
bottle
and
i
would
like
to
drink
many
of
these
if
i
were
to
find
a
fault
in
this
beer
its
that
it
may
be
slightly
onedimensional
due
to
the
sweet
malt
dominance
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
will
have
to
have
a
fresh
one
and
see
how
i
like
it
some
time
drinkability
i
dont
see
drinking
a
lot
of
these
in
the
future
due
to
sheer
inaccessibility
i
would
however
like
to
try
another
in
a
year
if
i
still
have
any
lying
around
and
i
think
i
do
north
coast
ages
just
fine
and
i
will
be
enjoying
them
again
2009
old
stock
ale
hmmm
ive
had
lots
of
new
ale
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
this
ale
has
a
delicious
smell
of
butterscotch
licorice
anise
and
malts
pours
into
a
pint
with
a
thin
but
fizzy
big
bubble
head
the
color
is
a
medium
brown
that
is
only
slightly
translucent
upon
tasting
its
the
mouthfeel
that
first
becomes
evident
this
is
a
very
thick
ale
high
viscosity
almost
like
motor
oil
the
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
black
licorice
some
butterscotch
some
anise
very
similar
to
the
smell
no
bitterness
here
too
speak
of
or
if
there
is
the
malt
buries
it
sniffing
the
bottle
after
the
pour
it
has
an
interesting
tequila
smell
this
is
tasty
and
it
is
one
heavy
hitter
ill
sip
the
rest
of
this
one
and
the
other
3
from
the
4
pack
are
going
to
get
cellared
cheers
value
b
d
definitely
a
nightcap
but
incredibly
tasty
at
that
the
barrage
of
great
and
complex
flavours
keep
you
bringing
it
back
hides
the
alcohol
like
a
champ
gets
slightly
hot
after
it
warms
quite
a
bit
but
pleasant
very
well
donenow
if
only
i
could
get
my
hands
on
the
bourbon
andor
brandy
version
of
this
sip
this
bad
boy
out
of
a
nice
glass
and
let
it
warm
up
almost
an
excellent
beer
but
alcohol
is
markedly
out
of
balance
which
is
disappointing
after
2
years
in
the
cellar
still
impressive
complexity

this

ranks
up
there
with
my

favorite
barleywine
new
glarus
iced

both
are
impeccable
d
great
beer
for
its
style
still
way
too
hot
imo
it
seems
like
this
beer
could
go
another
35
years
i
have
one
more
bottle
i
think
i
will
repay
a
visit
in
2012
also
we
paired
both
versions
with
some
mimolette
a
french
cheese
which
tends
to
make
everything
delicious
however
i
have
drank
the
2008
without
the
mimollete
and
it
remains
just
so
goddamn
good
edit
from
other
reviews
i
need
to
pick
up
a
bottle
with
some
age
ill
have
to
update
when
i
do
drinkability
after
a
couple
more
years
of
aging
this
would
rival
most
high
abv
brews
for
the
style
this
brew
is
drinkable
its
not
a
pounder
sip
a
couple
of
these
on
a
cold
michigan
night
its
good
for
what
ales
ya
drinkability
this
one
has
been
in
my
basement
for
more
than
a
year
but
still
could
use
some
mellowing
its
really
delicious
and
a
joy
to
drink
but
a
little
boozy
it
is
a
12
old
ale
though
cant
really
knock
it
for
that
otherwise
its
full
rich
and
pretty
fantastic
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
minimal
khaki
head
and
little
lacing
and
some
stickyness
smell
is
a
huge
carmel
malt
burst
molasses
as
well
with
rasin
fig
and
alcohol
on
the
back
end
taste
is
of
ubersweet
malts
carmel
raisin
and
smooth
and
subdued
booze
profile
hints
of
wood
and
hops
on
the
finnish
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
sticky
minimal
carbonation
good
solid
old
ale
very
sweet
and
malt
forward
with
well
hidden
abvs
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
to
date
the
11
5
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
with
only
a
feeling
of
warmness
indicating
it
was
even
there
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
not
drink
the
entire
glass
in
one
fell
swoop
measured
sips
provided
maximal
pleasure
along
with
a
constantly
changing
portfolio
of
flavors
i
dont
usually
go
for
these
malt
bomb
type
beers
but
this
is
absolutely
delicious
as
a
sipper
granted
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
because
of
the
high
abv
but
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
those
cold
winter
evenings
i
had
bought
a
4
pack
of
these
and
have
drank
2
others
on
a
different
occasions
so
while
drinking
this
one
tonite
i
looked
over
my
notes
cheers
this
seems
to
get
better
with
every
year
that
it
ages
a
wonderful
brew
gonna
pick
up
the
last
4pack
at
my
store
tomorrow
and
age
a
number
of
bottles
d
high
abv
being
the
biggest
disincentive
to
drink
this
i
wonder
how
this
would
mellow
with
age
i
enjoy
the
alcohol
profile
on
this
beer
smacks
me
in
the
front
of
the
tongue
d
this
is
an
in
your
face
brewing
creation
be
warned
this
brew
needs
to
be
sipped
slowly
a
definite
attention
grabber
of
a
brew
memorable
but
i
could
never
envision
an
occasion
that
would
call
for
more
than
one
of
the
booze
bombs
for
such
a
strong
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
not
heavy
or
syrupy
and
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
mild
carbonation
really
allows
the
complexities
to
shine
calen
and
daniel
overall
this
old
ale
is
an
elegant
after
dinner
fireside
sipper
that
delivers
a
nice
bourbon
like
alcohol
punch
d
one
of
my
favorite
old
ales
so
far
big
syrupy
and
round
although
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
ive
got
several
of
these
to
age
and
see
what
comes
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
almost
red
with
respectable
head
that
quickly
faded
to
nothing
the
aroma
was
sweet
like
cotton
candy
sweet
and
alcohol
lots
the
taste
was
heavily
alcohol
tasted
like
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
there
was
also
caramel
and
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
the
feel
was
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
no
way
i
dont
think
you
could
even
sniff
two
of
these
but
it
was
very
smooth
like
two
fingers

this

ale
is
among
the
the
best
ive
had
this
version
is
13

quite
heady
and
hefty
but
youd
never
know
because
it
is
so
balanced
mellow
and
drinkable
this
is
one
world
class
bw
very
well
done
thanks
a
lot
for
this
harry
drinkability
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
are
spot
on
for
an
old
alestock
ale
d
an
enjoyable
sipper
the
alcohol
is
not
nearly
as
apparent
as
it
could
be
and
it
does
taste
damn
good
worth
getting
and
i
bet
this
could
age
for
quite
some
time

it
is
already
gorgeous
the

is
quite

mellow

this

great
qualities
itll
hopefully
have
with
some
age
drinkability
surprisingly
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
huge
beer
very
beautiful
beer
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
chewy
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
sweet
finish
lingers
for
a
while
o
yum
packaging
says
to
lay
it
down
for
a
year
hmmmm
this
beer
is
scarily
drinkable
im
not
sure
if
it
was
just
me
but
3
bottles
out
of
the
4
pack
disappeared
way
too
quickly
and
led
to
a
rough
morning
oh
boy
my
first
sampling
of
this
style
i
picked
up
a
fourpack
from
the
store
yesterday
and
i
was
planning
on
cellaring
them
but
i
couldnt
wait
i
have
the
2009
edition
poured
into
a
pint
glass
at
first
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
as
cloudy
as
a
hefe
but
it
cleared
up
after
a
few
minutes
never
seen
that
before
after
a
vigorous
pour
into
a
pint
glass
it
produced
about
a
quarterinch
tan
head
which
stuck
around
longer
than
anticipated
smells
fantastic
sweet
and
boozy
im
getting
ripe
sweet
fruit
like
plums
and
raisins
also
toffee
or
brown
sugar
taste
echoes
the
smell
with
the
addition
a
sherrylike
quality
i
love
this
bubbles
continue
as
beer
warms
and
flavor
intensifies
thank
you
ba
i
would
never
have
tried
a
beer
this
expensive
without
you
notes
another
impressive
beer
from
north
coast
brewing
company
a
great
american
brewer
pours
a
dark
opaque
rubyamber
color
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
eventually
leaving
nothing
behind
nose
is
spicy
and
of
coffeetoffeechocolate
and
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
of
toffee
raisinsfigsplums
and
a
bit
of
licorice
also
has
the
spicy
kick
very
prominent
taste
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
smooth
and
with
strong
carbonation
not
particularly
drinkable
but
thats
the
style
d
this
is
a
drink
for
sipping
not
gulpingdespite
the
incredible
taste
an
excellent
cap
to
a
chilly
fall
night
well
built
and
complex
but
i
cant
imagine
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
though
extremely
rich
and
heavy
i
sound
disappointed
and
maybe
i
am
but
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
drink
tucking
away
with
a
single
bottle
of
this
from
my
cellar
on
a
chilly
night
watching
postseason
baseball
is
a
nice
night
indeed
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
expected
more
depth
of
flavor
but
what
is
there
is
pleasant
enough
overall
in
my
mind
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
sipping
on
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
very
good
but
most
definitely
not
an
every
day
beer
more
like
a
onceayear
treat
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
2006
vintage
the
ale
appears
the
color
of
murky
fresh
brewed
iced
tea
with
a
prominent
crimson
hue
and
about
a
finger
of
tan
foam
nose
and
flavors
are
dominated
by
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
plums
sweet
cherries
raisins
more
toffee
brown
sugar
red
apples
there
is
still
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
heat
but
its
not
overpowering
approaching
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
one
sip
at
a
time
this
has
been
the
first
cool
weekend
of
the
year
for
us
in
north
florida
and
its
been
a
weekend
for
new
big
beers
for
me
starting
with
bells
expedition
last
night
old
stock
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cool
day
and
remind
you
that
winter
warmers
are
just
around
the
corner
north
coast
has
not
disappointed
me
with
this
beer
notes
this
is
a
damn
tasty
old
ale
that
drinks
really
well
when
fresh
for
weighing
in
at
11
5
abv
the
aging
potential
is
obvious
but
this
doesnt
require
the
time
in
the
cellar
that
other
old
ales
of
this
strength
need
having
said
that
the
2007s
are
tasting
spectacular
right
about
now
another
winner
from
north
coast
brewing
recommended
pours
a
chocolate
brown
color
with
honey
highlights
a
small
but
dense
tan
head
that
settled
into
a
solid
ring
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
sugary
raisinprunes
a
bit
of
an
earthy
characteristic
pops
in
and
out
a
very
nice
toasted
malt
body
with
some
sugary
sweetness
that
plays
well
with
the
malt
there
is
some
light
chocolate
or
carob
notes
that
add
that
earthy
quality
a
good
dose
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
dark
grapes
round
out
the
brew
the
booze
is
detectable
and
adds
a
light
belly
burn
despite
the
belly
burn
the
feel
is
quite
good
nice
carbonation
helps
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
solid
body
almost
thick
and
kind
of
sticky
a
very
enjoyable
fresh
old
ale
i
kind
of
like
old
ales
with
their
carbonation
ill
cellar
a
few
to
calm
down
the
abv
and
see
how
the
flavors
change
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
this
is
a
superb
offering
from
a
wonderful
brewery
and
my
first
experience
with
old
ales
i
will
be
revisiting
this
style
and
this
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
my
first
of
the
style
and
would
like
to
try
more
i
got
married
this
summer
and
i
think
i
will
purchase
a
few
4
packs
of
this
to
age
to
celebrate
future
anniversaries
pours
a
dark
hazed
ruby
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring

steady
stream
of
small
carbonation

caramel

aroma
very
sweet
some
dark

flavors
alcohol
is
warming
but
doesnt
burn
overall
flavor
is
very
similar
to
a
brandy
amazingly
drinkable
d
a
good
winter
nightcap
i
dont
think
this
quite
holds
up
to
some
of
the
great
old
ales
but
i
will
revisit
this
in
about
three
years
dark
amber

d
all
and
all
great
for
the
style
and
good
on
a
strong
ale
occation
will
get
for
others
to
try
this
was
a
very
impressive
brew
and
very
sneaky
12
5
abv
it
balances
the
high
abv
very
well
but
is
compex
and
bold
enough
to
pace
you
accordingly
pace
yourself
on
this
well
made
big
brew
nice
work
ncbc
this
is
absolutely
a
sipping
beer
but
for
the
abv
id
say
its
quite
drinkable
a
very
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
think
would
get
higher
scores
if
it
were
rarer
just
a
delicious
highquality
flawlessly
crafted
beverage
in
every
respect
pours
a
hazy
orangeruby
shade
with
tan
head
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
malted
barley
subtle
cherries
apples
this
is
a
sugar
bomb
very
little
hops
body
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
at
12
5
abv
and
high
sugar
one
bottle
is
enough
at
a
time
but
a
fantastic
brew
brings
back
fond
memories
of
driving
up
to
the
brewery
with
joeyschlitz
last
november
and
dining
at
their
brewpub
d
high
for
the
abv
and
style
paired
amazingly
well
with
a
creamy
tomato
soup
drinkability
is
extremely
high
given
the
abv
but
the
alcohol
still
does
limit
the
experience
somewhat
the
many
facets
this
beer
presents
make
for
an
enjoyable
experience
i
cant
wait
for
winter
so
i
can
enjoy
one
of
these
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
night
i
find
the
old
ale
to
be
an
intriguing
style
and
this
ones
just
a
nice
brew
that
12
5
really
does
the
job
d
the
only
thing
i
can
come
up
with
that
isnt
great
about
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
you
cant
manage
to
drink
as
much
of
this
one
as
you
would
like
to
one
of
the
best
american
beers
ive
ever
had
2009
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
with
a
mild
translucent
brown
color
pretty
fizzy
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
smell
is
sweet
and
nutty
hints
of
pecans
caramel
and
fudge
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
huge
alcohol
burn
up
front
behind
the
burn
are
some
raisins
dark
fruit
and
nuts
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
fizzy
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
here
and
it
hurts
the
drinkability
im
going
to
have
to
take
my
time
with
this
one
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
smell
is
sweet
caramel
raisins
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
has
a
background
sweetness
raisins
and
dark
fruit
again
chocolate
light
bitterness
and
some
herbal
notes
in
the
finish
very
tasty
strong
and
boozy
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
pretty
extreme
malt
bomb
d
nice
to
sip
postmeal
but
i
dont
think
that
its
possible
to
slug
down
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
during
a
session
d
i
have
absolutely
nothing
against
high
alcohol
beer
but
when
the
booze
is
the
more
prominent
factor
and
overwhelmed
good
parts
of
he
beer
then
i
have
a
problem
this
is
the
case
with
this
beer
vintage
2007
and
its
still
this
boozy
wow
it
has
a
lot
of
good
things
going
on
but
its
sad
they
are
majorly
overshadowed
by
a
boozy
burn
thats
hard
to
get
passed
at
least
as
it
warmed
it
began
to
really
let
go
of
the
booze
to
let
the
nuances
pull
out
further
due
to
a
lack
of
real
taste
and
an
overpowering
alcohol
presence
this
beer
is
bound
to
take
a
while
to
finish
maybe
ill
pick
up
some
flavors
yet
d
pretty
high
considering
the
abv
delicious
stuff
thats
worth
seeking
out
it
seems
ridiculous
to
rate
drinkability
of
an
old
ale
carrying
12
5
abv
but
compared
to
other
old
ales
i
would
rate
this
as
avg
i
could
sip
another
of
these
without
trouble
but
everything
id
try
to
do
after
that
would
be
trouble
md
slightly
bitter
and
sour
with
a
dry
feel
after
a
couple
o
minutes
the
drinkability
is
decent
as
a
sipper
but
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
by
far
d
one
and
done
nice
to
have
while
watching
a
movie
but
certainly
not
a
beer
you
would
bring
for
a
night
out
very
drinkable
as
far
as
having
one
after
that
its
a
bit
too
much
overall
great
friggin
beer
people
d
this
one
is
not
for
me
i
got
through
it
pretty
quickly
but
only
because
it
was
my
first
of
the
evening
its
not
terrible
but
the
booziness
is
just
too
much
i
would
not
buy
it
again
drinkability
its
tasty
but
it
really
packs
a
wallop
a
good
sipper
but
twelve
ounces
is
certainly
all
i
need
overall
i
was
a
little
taken
back
by
this
the
2008
i
had
def
had
more
character
maybe
this
one
is
good
but
it
needs
some
time
in
the
cellar
imo
d
at
12
5
abv
i
would
say
that
this
beer
would
be
a
one
and
done
for
me
it
is
extremely
smooth
which
makes
this
a
dangerously
good
beer
especially
after
aging
for
a
year
okay
this
stuff
is
hard
to
drink
for
me
lol
its
dark
when
you
pour
it
off
and
it
has
chocaltely
features
about
it
which
i
can
do
without
its
was
11
99
for
a
4
pack
and
the
alcohol
level
is
11
5
and
its
in
there
this
beer
is
strong
and
will
kick
your
ass
the
finish
is
horrible
it
tasted
like
spoiled
beer
yuck
spit
and
spit
again
d
i
dont
know
when
it
isnt
a
good
time
to
drink
this
beer
i
guess
after
youve
already
had
one
or
two
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
2007
version
much
the
same
as
the
08
but
perhaps
a
touch
softer
and
better
at
hiding
the
alcohol
perhaps
a
bit
more
brown
sugar
in
the
flavour
too
thanks
bobsy
when
i
opened
the
box
from
our
trade
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
this
gem
waiting
for
me
a
2007
vintage
it
poured
a
typical
orangey
root
beer
color
with
an
orangebrown
head
which
only
lasted
5
minutes
no
lacing
held
onto
the
glass
not
surprising
for
a
almost
12
beer
smelled
of
raisins
plum
orange
peel
and
still
plenty
of
booze
i
know
this
isnt
barrel
aged
but
i
get
some
oak
in
the
taste
some
nutty
flavors
some
citrus
from
the
hops
and
pretty
spicy
some
stickiness
thin
and
not
as
creamy
as
expected
after
a
couple
years
goes
down
easy
the
alcohol
as
high
as
it
is
but
it
doesnt
replace
the
classic
english
old
ale
overall
this
beer
is
a
decent
barleywine
im
just
not
too
into
the
whiskeylike
flavor
and
aftertaste
of
this
one
the
mouthfeel
after
finishing
a
glass
is
all
but
pleasant
its
definitely
a
sipper
in
closing
for
3
this
beer
is
a
steal
a
nice
strong
flavorful
beer
that
demands
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
with
a
smile
on
your
face
and
a
warmth
in
your
head
this
ones
a
slooowww
sipper
with
lots
of
big
sticky
hops
and
packed
with
malt
d
i
have
to
give
this
one
low
drinkability
based
on
the
high
abv
man
having
two
of
these
would
leave
me
feeling
a
mess
blipped

super
warm

calls
out
for
a
chilly

by
the
fire
or
a
rich
full
body
cigar
very
nice
overall
not
the
best
ive
had
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
old
ale
i
could
just
imagine
it
would
have
been
a
blast
to
brew
thinking
full
well
that
every
ingredient
added
to
the
kettle
is
double
in
strength
and
quantity
to
what
would
make
an
average
beer
i
just
imagine
the
brewers
with
the
mr
burns
finger
tapping
hand
grasp
excellent
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
head
that
fades
out
to
nothing
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
plum
and
chocolate
but
mostly
dominated
by
malt
and
alchohol
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
viscous
this
is
definately
a
sipping
beer
deep
rich
flavors
of
sweet
malt
wood
leather
tobacco
and
a
brief
kick
of
hop
bitterness
are
followed
by
some
not
so
welcome
alchohol
hotness
i
originally
put
these
down
for
a
few
years
hoping
that
the
rocket
fuel
aspect
of
this
beer
would
fade
a
little
it
did
but
not
enough
for
me
to
rate
it
over
a
2
5
in
drinkability
really
a
shame
considering
its
potential
for
excellence
wonderfully
complex
and
well
crafted
old
ale
but
i
am
not
interested
in
breathing
fire
after
every
sip
i
have
another
3
bottles
that
i
will
try
in
the
coming
years
and
see
if
they
fare
any
better
the
mouthfeel
is
warm
with
a
kind
of
fuzziness
from
the
booze
the
flavors
mellow
out
the
malt
gains
momentum
further
down
the
glass
making
it
not
quite
so
bracing
a
good
beer
one
im
satisfied
with
after
one
dthis
is
seriously
rich
stuff
that
is
only
overshadowed
by
its
sweetness
a
special
beer
meant
to
be
sipped
slowly
it
could
replace
a
nightcap
or
a
tawny
port
anyday
of
the
week
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
even
at
near
2
years
old
this
has
many
good
years
of
aging
left
in
it
if
one
desired
to
wait
longer
will
certainly
try
it
again
in
a
year
or
two
pours
a
nice

my

turn
off

aside
for
the

this

a
dangerously
drinkable
old
ale
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
aromas
and
flavors
that
accentuate
the
dark
fruitdominated
malitness
and
dry

a
really
exceptional

that
i
will

d
this
particular
old

was
my
favorite
but
not
enough
to
get
me
to
become
a
fan
of
the
style
just
not
for
me
quite
drinkable
but
wonder
what
even
a
milder
form
of
this
would
be
like
as
it
is
a
tad
strong
on
the
gut
but
overall
it
is
very
good
and
would
drink
another
found
this
at
prime
16
during
my
first
visit
to
this
great
new
haven
beer
bar
restaurant
i
had
just
recently
had
a
bottle
of
this
same
brew
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
knew
it
would
be
a
good
choice
here
on
tap
poured
into
a
small
snifter
this
one
was
a
deep
dark
amber
color
cloudy
with
a
whispy
light
oatmeal
colored
head
and
fair
lace
the
aroma
was
licorice
and
sweet
floral
hop
and
some
brandy
the
taste
is
almost
root
beer
sweet
with
more
brandylike
alcohol
its
full
bodied
with
fine
tingly
carbonation
there
is
a
tart
cherrypineapple
quality
somewhere
here
very
nice
and
warming
not
highly
sessionable
but
quite
tastey
d
the
big
abv
might
frighten
some
because
high
abv
means
really
boozy
and
might
negatively
affect
the
taste
but
i
found
that
i
didnt
even
think
about
it
while
sipping
it
it
definitely
can
be
sneaky
though
so

definitely
not

it
goes

i
was

i
didnt

to

it
alone

a

the
taste
isnt
too
far
from
the
nose
this
beer
is
really
boozy
and
for
me
it
is
relegated
to
the
sipper
category
this
is
a
thick
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
throaty
burn
there
are
tons
of
sweet
brown
sugared
malts
raisins
heavy
fruits
and
liqueur
like
soaked
pineapple
or
other
such
fruit
this
beer
is
just
too
strong
too
boozy
and
too
syrupy
for
my
tastes
it
is
an
extreme
beer
for
sure
thick
on
the
tongue
and
sugary
on
the
lips
and
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
to
really
detract
from
the
syrupy
body
despite
drinking
this
at
a
respectable
temp
i
still
found
it
to
improve
overall

it
warmed
to

it
just
really
smooths

is

to
break

alcohol
is
there
a
little
in
taste
and
big
time

drinkability
is
good
its
a
sipper
but
has
enough
redeeming
qualities
to
make
it
more
than
an
average
drinker
d
this
is
agreat
sipper
for
a
winter
evening
as
great
as
this
was
after
more
than
a
year
i
cant
help
but
think
that
a
few
more
years
would
help
mouthfeel
and
drnkability
this
beer
definitely
warms
as
it
goes
down
body
is
medium
leaning
heavily
towards
heavy
lower
carbonation
gives
this
beer
an
authentic
feeling
in
the
mouth
making
it
feel
as
if
it
has
been
aged
quite
a
long
time
before
being
bottled
this
is
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
sipped
on
dont
try
to
drink
the
four

the

poured

a
real
big
alcohol
component
throughout
mixed
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
and
malt
sweetness
are
too
dominant
with
not
nearly
enough
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
to
balance
out
the

leaving
no
ring
or
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
burnt
caramel
brown
malt
and
some
dried
fruits
the
taste
is
a
great
complex
blend
of
toffee
burnt
caramel
fruit
molasses
and
a
touch
of
mocha
with
just
a
slight
hop
character
the
beer
is
certainly
on
the
heavy
side
but
it
becomes
smoother
the
more
it
warms
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
but
an
enjoyable
one
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
and
see
if
i
can
age
it
taste
mouthfeel
sweet
without
being
cloying
the
malt
backbone
is
enormous
providing
a
wide
range
of
flavors
from
ripe
fruit
and
caramel
to
burnt
toast
bittering
hops
are
still
noticeably
present
though
they
take
a
back
seat
to
the
malt
a
slight
alcohol
bite
appears
for
a
second
in
the
background
and
then
disappears
in
the
finish
the
beer
ends
on
a
drier
note
with
a
bourbonlike
character
2007

very

sparkling

initial
flavor
is
alcohol
followed
by
a
long
and
nutty
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
carbonation
is
soft
there
is
a
strong
presence
of
alcohol
throughout
will
probably
improve
with
age
i
recently
drank
a
2002
and
2006
old
stock
side
by
side
in
jan
08
the
difference
is
remarkable
i
suppose
i
should
be
rating
the
06
since
thats
closer
to
what
people
will
be
drinking
straight
out
of
the
stores
but
i
cant
bare
to
rate
such
an
inferior
product
while
there
were
many
similarities
im
not
sure
if
the
recipe
has
remained
unaltered
or
not
but
they
certainly
taste
as
if
they
were
at
least
similar
recipes
and
the
06
tasted
like
something
that
could
some
day
develop
into
the
02
the
various
flavors
of
the
06
are
so
much
more
rough
and
aggressive
while
the
02
has
allowed
them
to
mellow
and
intermingle
resulting
in
a
much
rounder
more
subtle
combination
of
flavors
i
cannot
recommend
aging
this
beer
enough
i
still
have
a
bottle
of
the
02
and
the
06
and
plan
and
trying
them
with
the
08
in
10
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
has
a
good
taste
to
it
if
the
abv
wasnt
so
high
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
well
it
still
is
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
and
id
been
meaning
to
try
it
forever
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
glad
i
got
to
have
it
on
tap
would
order
again
for
sure
this
is
an
afterdinner
sipper
i
enjoyed
this
bad
boy
and
cant
wait
for
its
brethren
in
my
basement
12
years
from
now
d
its
about
as
drinkable
as
i
would
expect
it
to
be
at
such
a
high
percentage
1
maybe
2
of
these
for
me
is
enough
d
to
much
alcohol
to
have
more
than
a
couple
not
enjoyable
enough
to
have
repeatedly
2006
bottling
pours
very
dark
brown
with
copper
highlights
the
head
kicks
up
substantially
at
first
but
dies
down
to
a
collar
quickly
the
aroma
has
some
good
depth
showing
caramel
malts
marshmallow
and
milk
chocolate
but
it
is
compromised
by
some
overly
hot
raw
alcohol
on
the
palate
things
are
considerably
softer
with
good
malt
depth
and
lovely
raisin
notes
added
on
to
the
caramel
and
chocolate
indicated
in
the
aroma
still
a
bit
hot
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
rounding
out
into
something
special
and
certainly
one
that
is
benefiting
from
aging
time
i
wish
now
that
i
had
had
the
patience
to
hold
on
to
this
for
three
more
years
as
its
showing
some
major
longterm
potential
nonetheless
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
highly
recommended
a
worthwhile
budget
version
of
a
thomas
hardys
or
something
along
those
lines
i
bought
a
single
to
sample
ill
definitely
go
back
to
julios
for
more
to
cellar
id
be
eager
to
see
what
this
is
like
after
a
couple
years
to
mellow
out
and
mature

some

very
spicy
and
creamy
taste
with
some
alcohol
fermented
fruits
through
the
middle
raisin
and
some
date
the
finish
has
a
little
bit
of
a
coppery
taste
to
it
which
hopefully
will
fade
with
some
age
the
aftertaste
has
some
fruit
in
it
and
lingers
for
some
time
mouthfeel
is
good
and
viscous
drinkability
isnt
amazing
but
is
still
ok

i
would
take
it
easy
with

as
the
11

will
hit
you
hard
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
over
a
long
period
of
time
not
the
best
sample
from
north
coast
but
certainly
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
compromised
due
to
the
hefty

and
ultrasweet
thick

not
my
favorite
brew
but
worthago
d
notes
a
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
old
ale
makes
it
a
good
sipping
beer
but
not
particularly
sessionable
ive
had
these
every
year
since
i
moved
to
boise
i
just
wish
i
would
have
gotten
into
cellaring
sooner
i
can
see
how
a
long
time
in
the
cool
dark
could
help
really
take
the
old
stock
to
the
next
level
all
and
all
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
will
only
get
better
with
a
few
years
on
it
drinkability
this
beer
is
so
intense
so
flavorful
so
dominant
and
so
alcoholic
you
only
need
one
after
that
put
the
rest
away
and
revisit
in
a
week
much
like
stones
ruination
ipa
this
is
an
intense
experience
a
novelty
beer
for
when
you
want
to
do
have
some
serious
oneonone
time
with
a
beer
you
might
be
able
to
pair
it
with
a
dessert
much
like
a
port
or
with
prime
rib
with
currants
but
this
is
a
dominant
beer
that
deserves
to
be
respected
and
treated
with
moderation
i
poured
this
promising
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
bber
was
a
nice
mahoganny
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
was
a
little
nutty
and
i
was
hopeful
by
that
and
the
caramel
notes
coming
off
the
head
first
taste
was
good
i
thougght
then
the
alcohol
just
washed
all
that
great
taste
away
what
a
shame
i
will
not
buy
again
ive
always
looked
forward
to
purchasing
this
beer
i
think
this
year
is
a
little
less
sweet
than
last
year
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
it
doesnt
have
too
sharp
of
a
taste
recommended
pours
a
dark
pristine
amber
into
a
snifter
theres
very
little
head
smells
of
raisins
grapes
caramel
faint
apples
and
some
subtle
earthiness
in
the
background
the
aroma
is
complex
and
satisfying
in
and
of
itself
taste
has
a
slight
boldness
up
front
that
is
quickly
followed
by
an
essence
of
warmth
some
pine
big
malts
chocolate
faint
coffee
alcohol
heat
and
a
shot
of
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
left
behind
is
some
sugary
sweetness
to
accompany
the
certain
contentment
this
beer
provides
carbonation
is
excellent
despite
the
lack
of
head
in
fact
a
few
minutes
after
the
pour
bubbles
are
still
actively
searching
for
an
escape
i
wouldnt
describe
this
beer
as
fullbodied
as
there
is
a
certain
weightlessness
to
its
complexity
however
it
becomes
quite
filling
as
you
empty
your
glass
and
demands
to
be
sipped
as
you
let
the
warmth
and
alcohol
do
it
s
work
2006

sweet
and
malty
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
hop
presence
some
hints
of
the
alcohol
feels
thick
and
bubbly
at
the
same
time
very
drinkable
you
would
not
know
this
is
13
beer
would
recommend
this
beer
i
know
these
are
meant
for
cellaring
and
if
this
one
gets
better
with
age
i
better
stock
up
on
it
because
i
will
want
alot
of
them
in
the
future
despite
its
richness
and
high
abv
its
quite
drinkable
or
sippable
rather
if
i
can
exercise
the
willpower
i
hope
to
cellar
the
final
2007
bottle
until
2009
or
so
overall
an
interesting
old
ale
the
malts
dont
overpower
and
there
are
nice
medicinal
and
spicy
elements
that
provide
balance
i
believe
this
is
the
05
release
and
now
it
is
11308
this
was
a
steal
from
local
good
beer
store
and
it
has
proven
to
be
one
of
the
best
agers
i
have
purchased
pours
a
dark
cloudy
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
leaves
huge
legs
on
the
glass
when
swirled
smells
of
molasses
and
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
with
hints
of
toasty
maltiness
smokiness
and
caramelized
sugar
there
is
a
tiny
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
alcohol
is
present
but
does
not
distract
this
is
a
malt
oriented
beer
the
slight
bitterness
is
only
to
balance
the
scale
mouthfeel
is
super
full
and
carbonation
is
slightly
high
this
has
probably
the
highest
alcohol
content
11
7
of
any
beer
ive
had
but
even
with
this
in
mind
it
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
because
of
the
high
alcohol
and
how
filling
it
is
but
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
12

though
the

an
appearance
in

to
accompany

i
would
have
expected
a
bit
more
complex
flavor
profile
out
of
such
a
huge
beer
but
for
what
it
is
its
very
drinkable
ive
had
this
one
sitting
on
a
shelf
for
a
while
now
2005
vintage
waited
for
the
new
year
to
pop
it
here
goes
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
faint
amber
hue
with
no
head
but
does
have
lots
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
complex
mostly
a
sweet
fruitiness
of
raisins
cherries
and
dates
and
the
alcohol
is
also
quite
apparent
almost
brandylike
the
taste
is
much
the
same
lots
of
depth
with
the
foremost
taste
being
the
sweet
fruit
flavor
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
hop
presence
but
is
mostly
balanced
by
the
brandyesk
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
chewy
with
a
slight
mouth
burning
carbonation
dangerously
drinkable

this
is
one
that
you
have
to
remind
yourself
to
slow
down
very
well
done
i
need
to
get
my
hands
on
several
more
to
see
how
they
age
the
tasting
of
this
is
bittersweet
ive
been
saving
it
for
at
least
2
years
now
and
although
im
enjoying
it
now
i
dont
have
another
aging
time
to
go
to
the
beer
store
4

says
the
judge
from
the
bubble
it
might
be
interesting
to
try
a
recent
release
but
i
almost
like
the
drinkability
this
2
year
old
vintage
has
to
offer
d
at
the
moment
id
say
drinkability
is
only
average
but
i
will
be
eagerly
awaiting
opening
bottles
in
the
future
d
i
have
a
4
pack
to
lay
down
and
i
dont
think
ill
touch
then
until
this
time
next
year
i
think
this
would
make
a
very
nice
after
dinner
sipper
id
love
to
see
this
put
in
the
hands
of
a
big
brandy
drinker
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
this
beer
i
have
never
had
this
beer
before
so
i
couldnt
make
any
comparisons
between
a
fresh
bottle
and
one
that
is
aged
for
5
years
the
smell
is
faint
and
primarily
composed
of
alcohol
and
golden
raisin
with
some
hops
coming
through
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
develop
more
an
even
blend
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
pleasantly
sweet
though
not
terribly
complex
taste
stays
wet
on
the
palate
with
not
surprisingly
verly
little
carbonation
however
whats
really
remarkable
is
how
smooth
the
taste
is
for
the
alcohol
content
hence
my
drinkability
score
i
wouldnt
necessarily
want
to
drink
this
often
or
a
lot
but
this
aspect
of
the
beer
is
impressive
to
me
this
is
certainly
a
big
beer
sweeter
than
the
offering
from
previous
years
as
good
as
it
is
now
i
cant
wait
to
cellar
this
one
for
another
year
or
more
i
thought
the
finish
was
spicy
and
chewy
with
some
residual
sugars
left
in
the
mouth
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
think
if
i
drank
more
than
a
couple
i
would
be
asking
for
a
hang
over
this
is
a
sipper
i
found
it
went
down
to
easy
i
like
this
vintage
definite
sipper
brew
sliding
nicely
with
the
fire
and
college
football
interesting
very
hot
which
was
expected
a
slowsipper
to
be
sure
maybe
this
would
be
better
after
having
mellowed
with
age
though
not
bad
as
it
is
drinkability
wow
robust
is
an
understatement
difficult
to
drink
is
an
overstatement
its
a
sipper
like
a
sherry
like
a
port
fans
of
american
barleywines
should
love
this
one
an
obvious
match
for
stilton
or
stronger
a
single
is
more
than
satisfying
as
expected
not
spectacular
but
quite
well
done
2007
version
poured
into

from

12oz
bottle

a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
strong
of
malt
and
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
caramel
i
usually
dont
like
sweet
tasting
beers
but
this
one
tastes
very
good
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malt
fruit
and
has
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
high
alcohol
content
great
beer
havent
had
too
many
like
this
one
and
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
its
high
abv

drinkable
big
ale
old

is
a
sherry
like
old
ale
and
makes
a
great
nightcap

my
favorite

ale
this
is
a
deceptively

this
is
like
having
three
beers
in
one
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
your
having
only
one
i
really
like
this
beer
not
sessionable
but
easy
to
savor
and
enjoy
poured
into
my
hennepin
goblet
it
shows
itself
as
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
murky
character
to
it
much
lighter
in
color
than
i
had
expected
there
is
a
very
slight
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
the
smell
is
awesome
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
rumsoaked
raisins
behind
are
chocolate
and
fruity
notes
with
a
little
tinge
of
boozy
aroma
at
the
very
back
the
taste
is
incredibly
complex
i
served
this
beer
relatively
cold
but
there
is
still
a
huge
burst
of
flavor
that
pours
out
of
it
it
reminds
me
of
a
strong
doppelbock
or
an
eisbock
this
is
one
of
the
most
quenching
13
25
abv
beers
ive
ever
had
of
the
strongest
beers
ive
had
this
is
by
far
the
best
tasting
nutty
turning
to
a
fruity
flavor
im
assuming
the
fruity
flavor
is
from
the
alcohol
i
taste
candied
dark
fruits
and
christmas
spices
the
finish
is
so
mellow
and
smooth
you
dont
have
a
clue
how
strong
it
is
as
it
warms
up
it
begins
to
show
a
little
of
the
alcohol
spice
but
nothing
close
to
most
beers
10
and
up
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
thick
and
filmy
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
has
to
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
of
this
size
that
ive
ever
had
i
want
to
buy
a
bunch
as
cellar
them
for
a
few
years
i
imagine
they
would
taste
dangerously
good
aggressive
pour
yields
only
a
one
finger
light
tan
colored
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
very
little
stickiness
just
about
nothing
actually
dark
cloudymahogony
hued
color
to
this

smell
is
a
whole
lot
of
malt
caramel
scented
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
raisins
dates
plums
tobacco
and
leather
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
starts
off
with
a
boozey
caramel
malt
with
chocolate
sweetness
as
well
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
its
present
from
start
to
finish
oak
like
vanilla
notes
towards
the
end
with
a
warm
molasses
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
full
thick
and
rich
a
bit
dry
as
well
which
surprised
me
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
had
a
tough
time
drinking
this
one
i
could
see
even
more
age
doing
this
brew
some
good
nice
beer
from
north
coast
one
of
their
best
recommended
thick
and
full
mouthfeel
a
true
sipper
and
definitely
limited
to
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
a
drank
the
glass
the
beer
did
grow
on
me
or
was
it
the
alcohol
and
i
went
from
thinking
this
an
above
average
beer
to
one
i
will
have
to
pick
up
again
for
the
cold
winter
months
that
are
quickly
approaching
drinkability
i
want
to
cellar
this
and
have
it
for
years
very
drinkable
and
im
very
willing
to
have
it
again
and
again
comment
ok
im
a
fan
this
is
a
neat
experience
rich
creamy
malty
and
full
of
flavor
ill
be
back
and
cant
wait
to
find
out
what
this
brews
brothers
and
cousins
have
in
store
for
me

2006

abv
d
unless
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
this
one
might
be
a
overwhelming
from
the
malty

and
enjoy
d
good
sipper
an
excellent
1
to
2
hr
nightcap
brew
c
overall
a
great
beer
on
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
had
but
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
12
ounce
bottle
2006
old
stock
ale
13
25
abv
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
mahogany
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
mostly
raisins
and
alcohol
sherrybrandy
it
tastes
like
plums
caramel
brown
sugar
and
raisins
its
a
very
malty
beer
you
can
definitely
notice
the
alcohol
but
theres
not
much
of
a
burn
at
all
which
is
nice
you
can
notice
the
alcohol
more
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
taste
however
the
alcohol
does
hit
you
later
on
mouthfeel
is
full
thick
slick
and
creamy
very
nice
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
even
considering
the
abv
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
its
a
sipping
beer
but
definitely
a
good
one
again
this
is
a
sipper
but
one
id
have
again
in
a
heartbeat
could
use
a
couple
more
years
and
this
particular
year
06
is
a
couple
percent
stronger
than
the
others
ive
got
drinkability
very
good
sole
limitation
is
the
alcohol
edit
from
1114
tried
the
2010
version
of
this
beer
on
tap
at
apex
in
pdx
and
was
fascinated
by
what
a
few
years
of
bottle
age
does
for
it
the
beer
wasnt
nearly
as
sweet
or
boozy
tasting
and
there
was
almost
a
flower
flavor
aspect
to
the
flavor
profile
that
was
intriguing
very
very
impressive
an
nice
so
i
get
the
impression
that
this
beer
ages
very
very
well
d
a
really
good
ole
ale
that
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
be
careful
but
its
lovely
to
sip
nice
sharp
sweet
flavors
without
being
too
overwhelming
even
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
im
still
liking
it
another
high
score
for
north
coast
a
great
sipper
very
nice
as
an
after
dinner
drink
or
just
by
itself
on
a
quiet
evening
low
carbonation
smooth
but
not
too
thick
feel
to
it
i
hadnt
drank
one
of
these
in
several
years
but
picked
up
a
single
to
try
it
was
as
good
as
i
remembered
a
malt
bomb
to
be
respected
not
really
the
season
for
a
big
old
ale
like
thisbut
highly
recommended
for
a
cold
winters
night
this
old
ale
blows
away
thomas
hardy
imo
well
worth
the
3
for
this
12oz
bottle
rather
than
the
8
8oz
bottle
of
hardy
im
pretty
stoked
to
see
how
this
ages
and
ive
got
a
few
shoved
away
for
the
years
to
come
if
youre
in
to
sipping
beers
then
this
is
a
fine
one
probably
one
of
north
coasts
better
beers
imo
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
old
ale
it
definatly
holds
up
well
with
age
will
have
to
try
a
new
one
to
see
what
the
initial
was
like
but
it
was
enjoyable
albeit
very
very
strong
d
just
one
of
these
makes
itself
known
in
the
head
proceed
with
caution
but
enjoy
in
the
meantime
a
delicious
beer
worthy
of
some
attention
old
stock
pours
a
very
dark
red
amber
color
with
no
head
to
write
home
to
mom
about
but
subtle
and
quickly
dissapating
into
a
very
small
ring
on
the
outside
i
smell
candy
and
caramel
maybe
some
bananas
as
well
i
get
almost
a
bourboncandy
taste
along
with
that
caramel
the
taste
is
really
good
once
sipped
it
is
quite
smooth
to
the
mouth
however
it
heats
as
it
goes
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
and
have
cellared
one
to
see
what
a
year
or
so
will
do
however
the
high
alcohol
and
the
boubonlike
qualities
will
keep
the
drinkability
down
on
this
one
most
definitely
a
slow
sipper
a
great
one
from
north
coast
2007
vintage
pours
a
ruby
redbrown
with
a
dark
white
does
that
make
sense
head
that
goes
away
quick
like
samichlaus
plenty
of
carbonation
though
hops
and
malt
and
fruit
raspberry
in
the
nose
pretty
complex
and
interesting
also
smell
booze
tons
of
things
come
through
in
taste
but
raspberry
hops
booze
sugar
mostly
dominant
mildly
syrupy
mouthfeel
from
a
beer
this
strong
i
would
expect
much
more
syrup
nice
carbonation
mouthfeel
smooth
and
not
as
bitter
as
would
be
expected
i
can
sip
on
this
one
all
night
long
but
it
would
probably
be
wise
to
only
inbibe
as
an
apertif
tasty
strong
delectable
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
high
alcohol
keeps
the
drinkability
down
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
ages
just
for
kicks
i
tried
the
2011
bottling
on
112711
and
the
major
difference
as
expected
was
the
level
of
hops
in
the
flavor
profile
still
this
ale
uses
english
hops
so
they
blend
very
nicely
with
the
big
malt
bill
the
beer
also
has
more
of
a
cherry
flavor
than
i
recalled
in
earlier
versions
d
not
overly
complex
but
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
was
very
full
and
heavy
but
right
where
it
should
be
all
things
considered
and
while
this
was
very
good
indeed
its
heaviness
and
abv
really
limit
its
drinkability
this
is
without
question
a
sipper
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
and
i
would
likely
be
sick
all
in
all
however
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
this
is
my
second
old
ale
and
im
quite
pleased
with
the
style
i
look
forward
to
trying
these
as
they
age
and
the
flavors
integrate
more
fully
a
well
balanced
baby
from
the
getgo
the
complexities
are
numerous
a
tight
frothy
head
initially
fading
into
a
large
rim
of
noticeable
alcohol
a
sipper
for
sure
this
baby
warms
you
up
but
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
very
balanced
and
highly
recommended
rather
than
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
get
a
tannic
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
a
wine
overall
its
pretty
complex
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
when
i
drink
it
again
it
will
be
after
some
aging
overall
recommended
i
always
enjoy
this
beer
and
have
some
stashed
away
aging
cant
wait
to
try
those
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
than
two
bottles
of
this
at
once
while
i
enjoy
a
glass
of
this
it
is
not
something
to
spend
drinking
during
a
night
at
the
bar
it
can
definately
sneak
up
on
you
a4
s4

this
beer
should
definitely
be
aged
and
then
drunk
in
cold
weather
it
definitely
tastes
new
and
has
some
sharp
edges
that
will
hopefully
be
worn
down
in
the
cellaring
process
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
2005
and
intend
on
setting
that
down
for
at
least
a
year
right
next
to
my
other
bottle
of
2007
and
then
drinking
them
back
to
back
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
aging
does
to
it
its
an
old
ale
and
its
young
so
obviously
the
drinkability
isnt
great
but
this
already
shows
signs
of
a
beer
that
will
be
really
good
by
next
winter
im
so
glad
north
coast
does
this
beer
because
it
seems
as
though
most
u
s
breweries
are
afraiduninterested
in
the
style
good
stuff
the
body
is
big
and
the
strong
alcohol
presence
is
overwhelming
and
takes
getting
use
to
but
again
with
the
aging
thing
carbonation
is
limited
but
good
for
style
i
have
a
05
vinatage
in
a
bif
a
while
ago
but
i
would
really
like
to
see
how
this
style
ages
taste
is
wonderful
almost
a
fiver
slight
bitterness
countered
by
sweet
raisins
semithick
finishes
really
nice
hard
to
review
this
beer
bc
i
drank
it
without
really
noticing
that
i
drank
it
all
wonderful
good
job
eric
wow
this
beer
is
meant
for
sippin
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
to
take
to
a
tail
gate
party
i
would
look
for
something
else
this
is
a
sit
down
in
a
den
next
to
the
fire
relax
and
drink
slowly
brew
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
the
taste
but
not
distracting
nice
redbrown
color
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
scotch
ale
in
fact
no
scotch
in
the
house
try
some
old
stock
ale
md
no
flavor
is
overwhelming
and
the
sweetness
is
just
right
the
alcohol
nips
at
the
palate
reminding
you
its
still
there
the
flavors
are
different
from
most
beers
ive
tasted
which
is
great
letting
this
beer
age
a
few
years
has
fixed
some
imperfections
i
could
imagine
come
with
the
2007
batch
and
has
also
made
it
one
of
my
favorite
old
ales
and
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
in
comparison
the
longshot
old
ale
from
sam
adams
was
good
but
was
overly
malty
and
fairly
strong
old
stock
ale
has
every
aspect
of
an
old
ale
almost
perfect
and
its
truly
drinkable
i
could
drink
several
bottles
of
this
on
almost
any
night
2007
vintage
the
pour
looked
pretty
good
deep
burgandy
brown
but
other
than
that
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
for
me
the
aroma
was
very
malty
a
little
burnt
and
cough
syrup
sweet
the
flavor
was
too
sweet
too
drink
easily
and
burned
with
alcohol
on
the
backside
thickish
mouthfeel
was
a
redeeming
factor
but
not
enough
to
help
me
finish
the
bottle
i
didnt
alchol
needs
to
settle
down
a
lot
on
this
one
that
cherrycough
syrup
thing
overwhelms
and
makes
it
nearundrinkable
overall
a
mediocre
barley
wine
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
are
pretty
harsh
and
brash
and
it
is
not
very
complex
maybe
this
is
better
after
sitting
a
while
it
is
pretty
hot
very
good
beer
i
kind
of
wish
it
was
bottle
conditioned
i
have
6
more
that
i
want
to
age
but
i
dont
think
it
will
change
a
whole
lot
since
its
so
well
filtered
taste
is
really
nice
and
balanced
bitterness
is
perfect
for
the
sweetness
i
enjoy
it
alot
ever
so
slightly
nutty
and
quite
malty
dark
flavors
seem
to
come
from
alot
of
medium
toast
instead
fo
any
dark
toasted
malts
d
old
ale
being
my
favorite
style
notwithstanding
this
beer
was
a
little
too
strong
too
decadent
to
merit
a
high
drinkability
score
better
share
this
one
pours
a

taste
was
all

very
complex
hints
of
toffee

vanilla
sweet
dried

and
ripe
peaches
the
sweetness
was
total
no

bitters
present
a
huge
warming
alcoholic
effect
after
every
sip
of
this
creamy
brew
more
dried
fruits
in
the
aftertaste
but
suprisingly
little
alcohol
for
such
a
huge
beer
it
hides
it
well
sticky
sweet
finish
and
a
lingering
warming
sensation
now
it
just
seems
a
little
too
raw
and
virgin
drinkability
this
is
good
ale
and
quite
unique
a
sipper
and
maybe
only
one
per
session
mostly
because
of
the
very
high
abv
but
also
partly
because
this
is
so
sweet
that
too
much
of
it
may
be
nauseating
like
eating
too
much

at

this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
fullers
vintage
comes
to
mind
however
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
especially
since
they
changed
the
recipe
drinkability
my
first
old
ale
this
is
stiff
the
13

is
not
exactly
hidden
its
in

and
after
the

seems
to
mask
the
sweetness

that
might
be

hops
are

on
initial
sips
i
cant
believe
this
stuff
is

not
boozy
at
all
which
is
quite
an
accomplishment
it
is
a
smooooth
brew
hops
show
up
more
on
the
finish
giving
this
beer
a
nice
bitter
rounding
to
it
its
probably
a
good
thing
i
only
have
one
bottle
of
this
or
it
could
spell
trouble
mouhtfeel
is
heavy
and
thick
and
warm
minimal
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
sipper
for
sure

would
love
to
get
some
more
and
lay
it
down
for
a
year
or
two
drinkability
well
considering
the
13
25
abv
this
is
one
a
night
kind
of
beer
but
a
treat
nonetheless
with
proper
aging
im
sure
some
of
the
alcohol
kick
would
subside
and
make
for
a
much
smoother
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
would
like
to
try
some
older
vintages
as
well
as
a
fresh
one
to
compare
the
differences
this
beer
pours
out
a
good
little
head
that
falls
right
away
into
almost
nothing
the
lacing
is
almost
non
existant
and
the
color
is
a
transluscent
dark
brown
the
smell
is
sweet
brown
sugars
and
some
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
sweet
and
it
has
an
aftertaste
of
some
hot
alcohol
tones
not
prevelent
when
first
drank
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
nice
overall
i
would
try
a
different
year
this
one
didnt
wow

a

poured

a

slightly

with
a
small

that
quickly
fades
nose
is
sweet
alcohol
with
malts
and
a
sprinkling
of
hops
taste
is
sweet
malts
a
slight
smokyness
and
some
alcohol
doesnt
taste
like
over
13
though
so
i
guess
its
well
masked
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
like
cotton
yikes
drinkability
would
be
better
but
that
mouthfeel
and
high
abv
keep
it
down
this
is
a
big
beer
its
malty
and
sweet
but
with
a
nice
balance
of
bittering
their
website
lists
maris
pale
malt
and
fuggle
hops
imported
from
england
the
taste
and
color
definitely
make
you
think
of
an
english
nut
brown
ale
but
it
has
a
better
bite
and
at
11
abv
its
got
a
hell
of
a
kick
too
without
tasting
like
swill
unlinke
molsons
xxx
abomination
their
website
even
mentions
that
this
beer
ages
well
and
they
recommend
cellaring
it
up
to
a
year
i
may
try
storing
some
and
rechecking
it
in
the
future
dont
drink
this
beer
with
food
this
is
an
afterdinner
drink
meant
to
be
savored
it
was
so
damned
good
im
going
to
do
something
uncharacteristic
save
the
last
two
for
a
later
date
drinkability
very
drinkable
very
complex
beer
that
pleases
all
the
senses
good
choice
to
lay
down
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
i
didnt
realize
this
beer
was
13
25
abv
when
i
opened
it
up
i
drank
it
after
a
couple
of
other
beers
and
it
put
me
on
my
rear
drinkability
definately
not
sessionable
a
good
beer
to
quaff
while
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
or
watching
the
rain
drinkability
the
high
alcohol
content
will
keep
me
from
drinking
a
lot
of
this
beer
at
a
time
but
damn
does
it
hide
it
well
especially
as
it
warms
very
drinkable
for
the
this
tastes
very
sweet
and
feels
warm
and
very
inviting
this
is
nothing
too
special
for
me
but
tastes
pretty
damn
good
i
just
cant
butter
up
much
to
say
about
this
brew
with
the
proper
cellaring
this
2006
vintage
could
well
surpass
the
young
taste
rating
4
0
ive
given
it
pours
into
a
snifter
with
an
incredible
cognac
appearance
you
can
actually
feel
the
heaviness
of
the
body
as
you
swirl
this
beer
for
the
nose
the
smells
seemed
very
tame
for
such
a
huge
beer
very
subtle
malt
and
caramel
fight
faint
alcohol
tones
for
dominance
the
taste
however
is
a
smooth
warming
toffee
with
full
hop
involvement
as
it
drifts
into
a
semidry
nutty
finish
make
no
mistake
about
it
though
the
warming
13
25
percent
alcohol
is
fairly
evident
the
huge
mouth
feel
and
warm
nutty
tones
of
this
old
ale
remind
me
more
of
an
amontillado
sherry
than
a
port
wine
as
suggested
drink
this
ale
paired
with
a
warm
heaping
plate
of
spare
time
and
hopefully
a
good
friend
enjoy
a
delicious
warm
fruity
beer
great
ill
definitely
keep
buying
it

are
in

as
well
as
a

the
taste
is
really
nice
caramel

roasted
malt
up

with
a
dry
almost
dark
chocolatey
finish
very
mellow
for
13
maybe
the
4
or
so
years
of
aging
has
done
some
good
for
this
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
while
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
lots
of
carbonation
it
works
here
adding
a
bit
more
complexity
this
is
a
very
good
ole
ale
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
do
more
than
sip
one
of
these
throughout
the
night
high
recommendation
excellent
old
ale
i
would
purchase
again
maybe
a
4pack
a
year
maybe
more
if
i
had
it
available
near
me
pretty
solid
beer
that
would
be
even
better
in
a
few
years
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
one
time
but
it
is
still
a
decent
brew
it
is
much
better
with
some
age
on
it
i
remember
the
original
taste
not
being
as
smooth
so
enjoy
this
brew
i
only
rate
the
drinkability
as
this
is
a
super
serious
beer
with
a
deep
structured
flavor
profile
2006
edition
which
seems
to
be
higher
in
alcohol
than
the
bottle
suggests
beautiful
amberyellow
color
with
just
the
right
amount
of

this
beer
has
an
awesome

backbone
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
very
rich
mouthfeel
but
not
cloying
old
stock
is
perennially
one
of
my
top
ten
favorite
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
way
too
strong
to
drink
very
much
this
is
a
sipper
drinkability
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
strong
old
ale
that
has
aged
for
the
better
i
would
seek
this
one
out
if
you
like
a
big
strong
ale
go
easy
if
your
new
to
this
style
as
its
all
of
13
5
abv
my
favorite
of
the
north
coast
brews
drinkability
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
by
no
means
a
session
brew
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
one
over
an
hour
or
so
d
after
giving
a
4
5
on
the
taste
i
feel
i
have
to
take
drinkability
down
a
notch
only
because
i
almost
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
wonderful
aroma
and
taste
but
its
only
a
hair
from
being
too
much
for
my
tastes
id
really
like
to
try
the
2006
our
friend
beerpanther
gave
thats
right
gave
me
one
of
these
to
try
is
he
the
worlds
greatest
beeradvocate
i
think
so
d
i
like
this
old
ale
nice
flavors
and
smooth
but
this
could
sit
for
awhile
possibly
a
year
or
two
i
would
imagine
the
sharp
and
aggressive
flavors
would
become
more
subdued
allowing
the
tastes
to
become
more
complex
this
is
like
the
fine
grain
spirit
of
the
beer
world
great
job
north
coast
im
off
to
get
more
very
tastey
and
complex
the
ever
present
bitterness
gave
this
strong
old
ale
a
special
appeal
to
me
easy
to
drink
for
the
strength
i
highly
recommend
it
red
amber
color
with
a
slightly
tan
head
head
slowly
recedes
but
still
leaves
some
lacing
smell
of
sweet
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
even
a
bit
vinous
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
a
bit
earthy
as
well
improves
tremendously
as
it
warms
when
its
cool
its
a
bit
metallic
and
lacking
when
you
warm
it
up
it
transforms
into
a
solid
beer
higher
side
of
medium
carbonation
full
bodied
a
bit
sticky
on
the
tongue
an
excellent
sipper
but
even
though
its
a
year
old
it
still
has
plenty
of
room
to
become
the
shining
star
its
destined
to
be
d
pretty
good
with
the
beer
as
strong
as
it
is
it
is
a
wonder
that
i
almost
finished
it
before
i
finished
reviewing
it
was
better
than
i
had
hoped
for
i
like
it
a
lot
i
wont
mind
having
it
again
ill
be
pretty
close
to
north
coast
next
year
so
that
is
a
very
good
thing
thick
and
creamy
and
super
drinkable
got
7
more
of
these
babies
and
theyre
waiting
for
the
vertical
tasting
d
at
13
5
abv
it
would
be
hard
to
appreciate
this
bad
boy
after
2
but
i
could
fill
my
belly
up
with
this
stuff
2005
vintage
the
aroma
on
this
beer
sold
me
on
its
merits
before
it
even
got
12
way
to
my
mouth
strong
and
warm
with
very
low
phenolics
for
a
beer
this
young
good
carbonation
as
well
that
brings
the
hop
bittering
and
aroma
out
as
it
bubbles
i
am
going
to
try
this
vintage
again
in
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
it
goes
overall
i
really
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
at
first
but
after
it
started
to
warm
up
and
the
flavors
were
exposed
i
became
increasingly
pleased
with
it
now
im
excited
to
buy
a
few
more
and
even
try
one
at
room
temp
i
wouldnt
really
say
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
too
much
alcohol
notes
and
reminds
me
of
hard
alcohol
mixed
drinks
albiet
a
good
one
the
taste
is
very
unique
and
good
i
can
imagine
this
beer
being
phenomenal
with
a
few
years
under
its
belt
giving
it
time
to
mature
and
mellow
out
the
drinkability
is
just
ok
i
have
had
bigger
beers
that
drink
easier
than
this
but
wow
this
is
a
fine
brew
and
always
will
have
a
place
in
the
bier
keller
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
great
beer
even
young
i
was
left
wanting
another
one
of
these
highly
drinkable
old
ale
but
watch
out
for
the
demons
in
the
bottom
this
one
has
some
punch
poured
to
a
very
carbonated
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
minimal
offwhite
head
that
lingers
a
while
then
fades
to
no
lacing
very
strong
aroma
of
malt
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
wiith
taste
more
of
the
same
as
beer
warms
the
alcohol
13
25
becomes
much
more
dominant
the
palate
is
smooth
and
warming
at
first
but
again
is
overcome
by
the
high
alcohol
content
this
would
make
a
great
winter
warmer
this
is
a
very
tasty
old
ale
wow
this
is
heavy
tongue
thumping
ale
if
there
ever
was
one
smells
of
raisins
sweet
carmel
and
alcohol
immediately
hit
me
as
a
poured
a
nice
deep
goldenorange
color
was
present
with
a
nice
white
head
and
nice
lacing
flavors
were
nice
and
balanced
hops
up
front
followed
with
a
dried
fruit
flavor
and
then
an
over
the
top
sweet
maltiness
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
overall
a
great
old
ale
however
it
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
with
an
abv
of
13
5
i
suppose
that
is
expected
2006
bottling
d
a
hefty
brew
takes
a
bit
of
time
to
finish
one
but
an
excellent
beer
something
to
have
after
dinner
dangerous
but
highly
recommended
cheers
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
body
of
a
super
heavy
weight
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
the
beer
has
a
definite
warming
alcohol
feel
i
have
enjoyed
numerous
bottles
of
this
beer
the
beer
is
fantastic
from
the
start
until
it
sadly
ends
this
beer
is
a
very
strong
beer
and
i
enjoy
it
because
of
its
strength
and
smoothness
for
such
a
big
beer
and
being
quite
young
this
is
quite
a
fine
version
of
this
yearly
treat
i
expect
that
my
remaining
bottles
will
only
bring
me
more
enjoyment
as
they
have
some
time
to
mature
in
my
cellar
drinkabilty
this
is
disappearing
from
my
goblet
at
an
alarming
rate
the
high
alcohol
content
should
serve
to
dissuade
the
welladvised
to
stick
to
one
or
two
before
getting
on
that
forklift
but
aside
from
that
this
one
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
north
coast
seems
to
do
well
with
the
stronger
styles
i
also
really
enjoyed
their
russian

stout
another
winner
not
sure
how
much
longer
this
is
going
to
age
if
the
hops
drop
out

more
it
will

comes
more
from
the

then
any

just
screams

in
the
flavor
great

to
go
with
it
not
as
sweetsyrupy
as
it
could
be

really
an
enjoyable
beer
for
being

2006

great
to
see
this
highly
anticipated
annual
offering
at
the
growler
station
at

a
rich
deep
amber
with
a
thinner
but
well
retained
creamylike
off

head
one
word
to
describe
the

be

just
rich
and
almost
warming
dark

sugarand
a
real
alcohol
zip
as
it
warms
to
the
right
tempthis
beer
is
big
and
brash
to
say
the
least
its
fresh
and
nothin
is
holding
this
puppy
back
starting
out
a
little
sweet
with
raisinprune
and
brown
sugar
notes
up
front
with
that
warming
alcohol
always
prevelant
a
nice
drying
earthiness
shows
up
late
and
i
thing
really
cuts
thru
the
sweetness
even
now
at
such
a
very
young
age
a
touch
of
hoppy
leafiness
shows
up
as
well
this
growler
is
going
to
be
drank
slowly
over
a
few
days
its
warmingrich
and
ever
so
smooth
but
the
alcohol
keeps
me
from
going
overboard
on
it
and
i
think
its
a
good
thingill
by
a
bottle
and
hold
and
see
how
it
ages
masterful
pretty
good
brew
good
for
just
one
abv
is
so
high
d
way
prefer
the
2006
this
is
to
thin
and
flavors
are
just
different
its
like
they
stopper
flexing
their
muscles
and
held
hands
they
are
all
blended
together
better
but
not
in
a
good
way
also
alcohol
isnt
as
covered
up
as
well
i
would
definitely
say
go
for
the
06
if
you
have
the
option
needs
some
time
on
the
shelf
to
mellow
out
but
i
like
it
an
okay
beer
but
this
style
really
isnt
as
thrilling
when
its
fresh
ill
probably
buy
some
more
of
these
and
put
them
down
for
a
couple
of
years
overall
quite
a
tasty
old
ale
i
think
its
comparable
to
fullers
vintage
ale
definitely
a
recommended
brew

edition

abv
pours
a
cloudy
muddy
dark
copperchestnut
color
a
thin
foamy
tan
head
rises
but
falls
very
quickly
leaving
a
small
collar
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
of
dark
candied
fruit
alcohol
apples
and
caramel
flavor
is
very
similar
candy
caramel
along
with
some
darker
fruits
this
really
shines
as
it
warms
up
as
the
flavors
really
come
out
but
the
alcohol
is
more
intense
more
vinous
at
the
end
when
it
warms
maybe
some
citrusy
hops
thrown
in
at
the
end
medium
body
this
was
a
nice
sipper
could
probably
age
for
a
year
or
ten
looks
like
cokeacola
in
my
pint
glass
the
off
white
bubbly
head
dissapeared
quickly
lots
of
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
nutty
metalic
whisp
as
well
this
tastes
huge
and
as
i
glance
over
i
realize
this
is
13
25
alc
its
a
2006
maybe
i
should
have
let
this
sit
an
extra
23
years
i
get
unmistakable
barley
wine
traits
here
big
malt
lots
of
alcohol
raisins
chocolatecoffeelike
bitterness
on
the
edge
and
a
lot
of
warmth
and
burnt
wood
on
the
end
this
leaves
a
slime
trail
going
down
the
back
of
my
throat
and
all
500
pounds
of
that
big
ass
beer
lingers
eternally
on
my
palate
id
like
to
try
one
aged
for
a
few
years
where
the
burn
of
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
some
probably
a
lot
smoother
after
being
aged
a
couple
years
this
one
was
an
experience
but
a
little
harsh
muddy
caramel
brown
topped
with
a
whisp
of
ivory
head
looks
viscous
and
earthy
the
head
drops
out
entirely
after
a
couple
sips
a
surprisingly
authentic
english
aroma
distinctively
biscuity
thick
maris
otter
sweetness
with
an
earthen
woody
english
hop
aroma
fuggles
or
some
variety
thereof
resiny
hops
and
vinous
fruity
notes
in
the
vein
of
harvest
ale
or
thomas
hardys
the
first
sip
just
glides
along
the
palate
soft
gentle
carbonation
kinda
casky
like
real
ale
should
be
with
a
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
a
nice
sparkle
to
this
one
full
and
rich
with
malt
malt
more
malt
and
powerful
fruitiness
surprisingly
understated
and
underanticipated
sherry
and
vinous
flavors
cider
too
id
have
thought
this
would
have
shown
more
age
with
four
years
i
bet
it
could
easily
go
until
2010
if
not
longer
some
hop
bitterness
remains
in
the
finish
dulled
enough
so
the
malt
really
shines
but
contributes
a
good
amount
of
earthy
wooden
flavor
a
full
compliment
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
takes
up
the
finish
joining
with
some
boozy
indertones
vague
smoky
phenols
too
really
really
fruity
all
the
way
through
good
thing
i
like
that
flavor
profile
the
flavors
continue
to
intensify
as
the
brew
approaches
room
temperature
i
wouldnt
recommend
sitting
with
this
one
forever
because
the
already
gentle
carbonation
seems
to
run
out
and
the
last
few
sips
were
pretty
much
still
for
me
great
stuff
the
complexity
seems
to
grow
in
leaps
and
bounds
over
the
years
as
it
acquires
that
rich
succulent
dark
fruitiness
moving
slowly
towards
sherry
oldness
with
four
years
on
it
i
expected
this
to
have
shown
its
age
much
more
one
of
the
best
aging
beers
ive
ever
had
particularly
amongst
american
breweries
huge
but
full
of
nuance
i
dont
recall
this
being
especially
noteworthy
amongst
big
beers
when
fresh
from
the
brewery
well
worth
the
cellaring
2001
vintage
poured
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
musty
fruity
slight
alcoholic
aroma
plums
grapes
carame
and
grapes
are
all
prominent
flavors
this
was
an
enjoyable
barleywine
when
aged
for
the
proper
amount
of
time
a
fresh
one
can
be
tough
to
get
down
eb
its
a
sipper
beer
kick
back
with
some
tunes
or
a
good
movie
and
relax
kind
of
beer
drink
too
many
and
you
will
be
asleep
no
problem
cheers
quite
drinkable
but
i
could
probably
only
have
one
in
a
sitting
really
a
unique
beer
poured
into
a
belgian
tulip
the
beer
develops
a
thin
tan
head
which
quickly
turns
into
the
usual
glass
ring
held
up
to
light
the
beer
has
the
color
of
cranberry
juice
and
is
quite
transparent
otherwise
its
the
color
of
a
deep
red
wine
looks
austere
its
wonderful
to
watch
sparse
bubbles
rise
through
the
lovely
deep
color
smells
deeply
of
caramel
and
a
smell
almost
like
a
candied
apple
with
spicy
alcohol
very
sweet
juicy
and
acidic
as
well
first
sip
still
cool
drier
than
expected
malt
seems
somewhat
astringent
and
there
is
acid
as
well
still
alcohol
is
wellconcealed
cant
hide
the
warming
though
likeable
but
just
as
the
label
says
will
improve
with
a
year
in
the
cellar
medium
bodied
with
low
carb
resulting
in
wild
smoothness
i
have
3
more
bottles
to
sit
on
and
have
great
expectations
this
is
excellent
just
not
for
everyone
probably
has
great
aging
potential
but
already
quite
good
redolent
of
sherry
with
a
sweet
nutty
flavor
coupled
with
hot
alcohol
some
tropical
fruit
notes
are
present
but
vastly
overshadowed
by
the
high
abv
this
one
needs
to
settle
for
a
while
before
it
comes
into
its
own
the
potential
for
a
good
beer
are
present
but
its
not
ready
yet
d
north
coast
brewco
knows
a
thing
or
two
about
making
beer
the
carbonation
is
as
it
should
mixed
in
an
odd
way
the
small
bubbles
tickles
the
tongue
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
very
relaxed
with
some
very
big
bubbles
i
found
it
intresting
that
on
the
north
coast
brewing
website
they
reccomend
not
serving
the
beer
cold
but
condensation
is
visible
on
the
glass
in
the
photo
of
the
pour
outfrigginstanding
this
could
pair
well
with
any
super
strong
cheese
one
bottle
is
nice
to
split
amongst
a
couple
of
friends
in
a
snifter
it
is
easy
drinking
for
the
heavy
abv
man
has
this
aged
well
if
you
see
it
buy
every
bottle
you
find
the
high
alcohol
on
this
one
along
with
the
need
to
sip
it
makes
this
one
not
too
drinkable
thanks
go
out
to
the
longbeachbum
for
the
highly
flammable
beer
poured
with
a
baby
head
atop
a
body
that
looked
like
inviting
rootbeer
with
far
less
carbonation

syrupy
bourbon
with

notes
mingled
with

is
massive

cocoa
black
cherry
syrup
all
mingle
to
please
the
tongue
mouth
is
somewhat
thin
and
lightly
carbonated
i
like
this
and
would
love
to
see
what
happens
after
a
year
complex
rich
mature
did
i
mention
alcoholic
2005
edition
pours
deep
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
fairly
potent
with
some
dark
fruits
sugars
and
a
hint
of
booze
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
loads
of
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
bread
dough
a
bit
of
fruit
a
bit
of
spicey
hops
and
then
a
touch
of
vinousness
and
alcohol
which
really
is
well
masked
for
theabv
in
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
a
touch
syupy
but
also
has
some
dryness
to
it
though
it
could
maybe
use
a
tad
more
carbonation
overall
i
really
did
enjoy
this
quite
a
lot
but
drinkability
is
nearly
nonexistant
md
moderate
carbonation
which
was
a
surprise
heavy
and
tongue
coating
almost
unlike
any
beer
i
have
tasted
i
think
the
whisky
taste
comes
from
the
beer
being
aged
in
whisky
barrelsbut
i
am
not
100
sure
if
that
is
a
fact
slightly
reminded
me
of
a
weeheavy
ale
i
am
interesting
in
trying
other
old
ales
they
are
very
interesting
this
was
a
2005
old
stock
ale
11
4
av
no
other
dates
on
bottle
poured
in
a
snifter
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
would
probably
be
even
better
with
a
few
years
of
age
on
it
drinkability
is
still
good
i
dont
get
tired
of
the
flavors
but
could
not
drink
more
than
one
due
to
the
strength
i
think
this
beer
was
definitely
meant
for
aging
it
should
be
great
in
a
few
years
i
opened
one
of
several
bottles
of
the
2004
vintage
that
ive
been
cellaring
the
brew
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
fairly
big
and
lasting
head
given
the
high
abv
the
head
is
a
somewhat
dark
shade
of
tan
the
aroma
is
at
once
earthy
malty
and
alcoholic
theres
plenty
of
caramel
berry
and
fig
smells
mixed
in
there
as
well
i
think
that
there
were
more
hops
notable
in
the
brew
i
tasted
when
it
was
younger
the
taste
is
syrupy
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
sugar
and
malt
qualities
the
alcohol
is
notable
immediately
giving
an
intense
warming
on
the
tongue
and
throughout
the
mouth
a
lot
more
fruit
comes
forth
in
the
hindtaste
sweet
and
full
with
an
almost
chewy
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
for
beer
in
general
but
notably
carbonated
for
the
style
extremely
drinkable
and
very
satisfying
d
the
taste
was
a
bit
disapointing
but
all
other
aspects
of
this
beer
make
me
want
to
try
other
vintages
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
is
easy
as
the
alcohol
numbs
everything
pretty
quickly
very
tight
carbonation
initially
gives
way
to
sweet
porty
roughness
balance
is
ok
but
the
overall
complexity
is
tarnished
by
the
alcohol
highly
recommend
even
being
two
years
old
i
think
this
beer
needs
at
least
another
2
to
mellow
out
fully
id
like
to
see
some
more
sweetness
in
an
old
ale
and
more
body
as
well
this
beer
was
obviously
designed
to
age
and
i
feel
that
it
needs
to
the
other
three
bottles
from
this
2004
six
pack
will
be
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
a
while
i
think
quite
a
old
ale
overall
without
much
aging
i
think
this
one
would
definitely
benefit
from
extended
cellaring
thats
where
the
other
three
bottles
are
headed
i
still
enjoyed
this
at
an
early
age
though
taste
is
already
pretty
complex
but
a
bit
harsh
that
will
probably
tone
down
a
bit
with
aging
this
is
a
very
complex
ale
that
can
only
improve
with
age
at
13
25
abv
this
is
best
to
be
shared
but
to
be
enjoyed
no
doubt
overall
a
strong
but
sweet
beer
thats
surprisingly
drinkable
would
be
a
great
afterdinner
beer
i
wonder
when
this
finished
fermenting
and
then
was
bottled
no
head
and
by
appearances
barely
any
carbonation
color
runs
tan
to
blood
red
and
is
very
murky
the
smell
is
strong
on
raisiny
malt
and
alcohol
a
light
raspberrylike
fruitiness
is
also
present
nose
is
slightly
reminiscent
of
a
scotch
ale
wee
heavy
taste
is
loaded
with
sweet
and
tangy
malt
flavors
raisin
plum
caramel
cocoa
finish
is
earthy
with
alcohol
astringency
arriving
late
slight
bitterness
also
carbonation
was
actually
decent
despite
looking
flat
at
first
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
decent
flavor
complexity
overall
i
might
try
some
other
vintages
if
i
get
the
chance
alcohol
is
heavy
though
be
careful
d
if
you
dont
have
to
work
the
next
day
you
could
take
yourself
to
another
planet
with
a
fourpack
of
this
or
drink
one
and
cellar
the
rest
but
either
way
you
will
have
a
hard
time
not
drinking
all
that
you
can
get
your
hands
on
assuming
that
11
a
4pack
is
affordable
love
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
and
the
finish
lasts
forever
very
complex
and
overly
drinkable
delicious

ale

is
this
a
barley
wine

vinous
boozy

spicy

the
first
thing
i
notice
then
cherries
and
orgeat
syrup
nutty
essence
of
almonds
finish
is
vinous
bitter
and
alcoholladen
the
alcohol
is
the
most
noticeable
characteristic
this
one
could
probably
sit
for
five
more
years
and
meld
a
bit
for
as
highly
alcoholic
and
sweet
as
this
is
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
on
the
thinner
side
definitely
not
syrupy
but
almost
peppery
and
stinging
from
the
high
abv
but
more
or
less
smooth
when
looking
for
something
sweet
and
boozy
this
one
would
fit
the
bill
but
there
are
several
other
options
that
go
down
a
lot
more
smoothly
good
but
not
stellar
i
havent
had
a
10
abv
brew
in
quite
some
time
that
was
as
drinkable
as
this
its
awesome
drinkability
enjoyed
at
proper
pace
you
probably
wont
get
through
more
than
three
of
these
but
they
are
a
most
enjoyable
sipper
2005
vintage
this
brew
pours
a
classic
brown
color
the
head
is
light
brown
creamy
and
long
lasting
brown
on
brown
this
beer
simply
looks
interesting
and
different
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
butter
and
cream
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
very
smooth
overall
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
at
this
early
age
but
could
benefit
greatly
from
a
couple
years
of
aging
poured
with
no
head
characteristically
of
most
old
ales
nice
malty
color
the
aroma
is
of
very
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
for
sure
damn
the
sweet
malt
tingles
the
tongue
and
the
alcohol
burns
just
a
tad
on
the
way
down
an
excellent
brew
cant
wait
to
taste
the
rest
of
the
bottles
as
they
age
even
more
taste
very
nice
sweet
malt
with
some
raisin
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
which
fades
into
nice
residual
hop
flavor
form
what
i
understand
the
hop
flavor
is
much
more
in
your
face
when
the
beer
is
younger
the
beer
is
also
pretty
thin
probably
a
result
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
but
over
all
a
very
taste
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
a
little
overwhelming
when
consuming
at
room
temperature
but
i
think
it
fits
well
with
this
beer
i
believe
this
beer
as
optimal
at
about
18
months
notes
i
didnt
expect
this
2006
vintage
to
come
out
until
octobernovember
but
the
brewery
said
its
ready
to
ship
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
vintages
of
the
past
few
years
its
very
mellow
yet
assertive
in
its
flavor
take
your
time
with
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
and
as
with
all
vintages
of
old
stock
i
look
forward
to
laying
this
one
down
for
several
years
poured
a
clear
deep
mahoganyruby
with
a
very
thin
head
of

is
an
intense
deep
sweet

some
caramel
with
a
good
fuggles
hop
kick
to
balance
rum
like
alcohol
in
the
nose
very
nice
taste
is
rich
and
tongue
coating
sweet
chewy
malty
goodness
bit
of
coffee
and
raisin
balaced
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
character
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
slightly
viscous
wow
im
very
impressed
a
awsome
old
ale
the
alcohol
has
a
very
pleasant
effect
to
the
senses
and
brain
a
rich
strong
and
tasty
treat
i
will
be
buying
some
more
to
cellar
and
more
to
drink
now
this
is
the
old
stock
i
remember
this
is
one
of
the
2004s
that
ive
had
laying
around
the
past
several
months
i
could
not
stand
the
2005
as
green
as
it
was
when
i
had
it
earlier
this
month
but
it
just
goes
to
show
what
can
happen
in
a
year
and
some
change
i
dont
know
if
ill
have
the
patience
to
hold
on
to
my
last
2004
until
next
year
but
this
seems
pretty
optimal
for
what
this
beer
brings
to
the
table
the
alcohol
is
drastically
mellowed
but
the
oxidation
flavors
have
increased
which
is
why
id
be
afraid
of
aging
it
longer
than
it
has
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
old
ale
more
like
an
american
barleywine
in
the
malt
profile
really
but
one
should
seriously
consider
laying
this
down
for
at
least
a
year
rich
and
complex
strong
and
dark
like
i
like
my
women
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
after
half
the
bottle
sitting
around
a
campfire
this
would
be
awesome
more
than
willing
to
drink
another
of
these
not
now
later
this
is
an
endofsession
capper
liked
the
fresher
version
i
little
more

not
as

the

are
accentuated
by

notes
of

the
taste
is
full
and
sweet
and
it
coats
my
mouth
in
a

is
caused
by
a
marriage
of

this

is

it

weighted

scale
but
not
so
much
that
you
cant

pick

that
did

the
aroma
was

with

the
taste
was
rich
with
warm
alcohol
reminiscent
of
port

buttery

the
mouthfeel
was
dry

from

head
stays
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
lace
that
slowly
slides
back
down
to
its
creator
after
being
poured

light
sweet

smell
comes
from
the
glass

accompanied
by

a
nice

as
the
finish
is
quite
warming
with
a
slight

sting
on
the
tip
on
the
tongue
some
chocolate
notes
were
also
detected
as
this
warmed
as
was
a
stronger
alcohol
presence
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
chewy
at
times
with
an
almost

was

could

stronyl
of
sweet

and
alcohol
as
an

should
be
taste
is
mainly
of
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
but
not
the
burn
your
insides
of
averys
beast
but
rather
a
nice
full
warming
ethanol
which
is
much
preferrable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
excellent
for
the
style
kind
of
scarily
so
to
be
truthful
i
could
see
this
gracing
my
fridge
again
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
strong
white
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
lace
aromas
are
initially
fruity
giving
off
some
fig
and
raisinlike
tones
followed
by
some
alcohol
notes
and
candy
sugar
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
toffee
aroma
in
the
mix
as
well
initial
flavors
are
big
and
fruity
with
a
really
strong
dark
fruit
flavor
raisins
and
figs
are
most
present
following
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
overwhelms
the
mouth
whew
this
beer
is
kicking
afterwards
the
flavor
of
this
brew
progresses
to
be
quite
malty
with
a
mix
of
caramels
and
toffees
leading
the
way
the
finish
to
this
brew
is
a
bit
sweet
with
still
more
dark
fruits
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
that
leaves
a
tingling
spice
for
being
an
old
ale
this
brew
is
fairly
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
light
carbonation
that
just
tingles
on
the
tongue
definetly
a
nice
brew
to
try
out
other
comments
starts
off
quite
promising
but
that
odd
bitterness
gets
pretty
kvetching
during
the
first
half
of
the
glass
after
my
pallate
got
used
to
it
however
the
bitterness
was
no
longer
offputting
drank
this
one
at
room
temperature
as
suggested
by
frank4sail
who
gave
this
beer
to
me
imho
intense
but
not
over
the
top
a
nice
balance
of
characteristics
not
subtle
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
the
barleywine
lover
syrupy
mouthfeel
yet
smooth
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
tastes
like
drinking
a
fine
dark
chocolate
candy
with
a
grand
marnier
center
could
use
some
aging
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
im
aging
two
of
these
and
will
open
in
a
year
or
three
to
see
what
happens

it

wow
the
2003
release
is
over
a
year

now
and
its
even
more
amazingly
and
massively
malty

i

is
up
too
easily

highlights
there

along
with
a

whiff

this
is

lovers
wet
dream
im
more
of
a

but
this
is
a
good
brew
sweet
malty
some
fruity
type
flavors
and
subtle
hopping
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
finish
very
warming
mouthfeel
is
chewy
slick
with
very
slight
carbonation
drinkablity
is
decent
considering
the
style
but
i
would
have
a
rough
time
putting
down
two
of
these
if
you
like
em
big
mean
this
will
do
just
fine
pours
a
murky
dark
rusty
amber
with
a
rather
fine
head
that
quickly
builds
up
after
the
pour
and
just
as
quickly
fades
away
a
decidedly
rich
nose
with
less
alcohol
smell
than
expected
full
sweet
and
caramely
with
a
nonetheless
definite
alcohol
bitea
combination
that
evokes
scotch
ales
for
me
mouthfeel
is
similarly
full
and
decidedly
soft
and
chewy
presumably
the
fine
carbonation
is
at
work
here
alcohol
warmth
while
unceasingly
present
is
nontheless
not
as
strong
as
expected
some
astringency
up
front
gives
way
to
a
full
caramely
sweetness
no
shortage
of
malt
here
this
beer
is
unique
not
bad
tasting
but
not
what
i
expected
i
wonder
what
this
would
taste
like
if
it
aged
some
more
well
ive
always
enjoyed
north
coasts
beers
and
this
is
enjoyable
as
well
though
its
not
up
with
my
favorite
barleywinesold
ales
just
a
bit
unbalanced
i
never
thought
id
say
a
california
beer
needed
more
hops
its
still
one
id
probably
have
again
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
cherry
brown
color
but
it
loses
points
on
appearance
becaseu
there
is
little
head
that
came
out
and
what
little
there
was
was
gone
within
a
few
minutes
anyway
the
smell
is
not
what
i
would
call
pleasant
although
i
feel
that
if
it
aged
for
a
few
years
that
it
could
meld
together
better
its
got
an
almost
chokingly
harsh
smell
with
huge
spices
chocolate
red
wine
and
sticky
malts
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
but
it
is
almost
entirely
overpowered
by
the
chocolate
taste
not
letting
much
of
anything
else
through
the
aftertaste
is
too
sweet
and
syrupy
too
the
mouthfeel
is
good
except
for
the
various
contributing
factors
of
the
taste
sweetness
mostly
but
meduim
body
and
good
carbonation
make
it
ok
theres
plenty
of
alcohol
here
and
it
sure
doesnt
hide
it
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
i
feel
i
drank
it
prematurely
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
smooth
with
a
wellhidden
abv
only
a
slight
warming
effect
noted
nothing
too
harsh
or
overbearing
wellbalanced
and
it
got
better
as
it
approached
room
temperature
damn
nice
pours
a
red
dark
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
melts
away
quickly
the
aroma
is
quite
strong
nuttiness
sweet
fruit
alcohol
and
even
an
extremely
sweet
red
licorice
aroma
are
all
present
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
on
the
alcohol
maltiness
present
but
somewhat
overtaken
there
is
little
bitterness
just
a
hint
of
hops
very
nicely
balanced
i
was
a
bit
let
down
on
flavor
after
the
huge
aroma
the
nice
aromatic
elements
shine
through
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
malty
sweet
and
very
smooth
no
lacing
no
head
after
a
few
minutes
the
carbonation
is
perfect
light
and
lively
on
the
tongue
overall
tasty
and
above
average
ill
have
it
again
captain
there
be
malt
here
and
plenty
of
it
its
thick
sweet
and
filled
to
the
brim
with
malted
grain
and
damned
if
foregoing
any
semblance
of
balance
doesnt
work
here
the
muscular
abv
raises
a
red
flag
and
if
youre
wise
youll
take
heed
but
if
thick
rich
malt
is
your
bag
baby
then
youll
suffer
the
alcohol
gladly
and
have
another
just
as
i
will
so
now
excuse
me
while
i
enjoy
whats
left
murky
tawnybrown
hue
with
peachyamber
highlights
it
is
an
attractive
color
with
good
depth
the
offwhite
head
reached
a
disappointing
foamy
trace
and
it
disappeared
in
an
instant
only
a
slight
collar
remained
any
sort
of
subsequent
lacing
was
completely
nonexistent
the
nose
is
very
malty
bushels

notes
toffee

and

hops
i
find
the
aromas
to
be
very
inviting
but
the
potency
isnt
that
powerful
i
sniffed
hard
for
the
reward
the
palate
is
very
flavorful
the
alcohol
is
the
showstopper
it
is
not
harsh
or
overwhelming
but
it
is
very
prevalent
and
encompassing
similar
to
brandyrum
mixed
with
raisins
and
candied
sugar
good
warmth
toffee
lots
of
toffee
notes
faint
chocolate
hints
plums
too
and
similar
to
the
nose
distant
earthiness
the
hops
maybe
this
is
one
malty
beast
damn
yummy
this
is
pretty
close
to
fullbodied
the
carbonation
is
modestly
low
and
very
natural
lovely
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
i
really
enjoyed
old
stock
ale
this
beer
really
wasnt
on
my
radar
thanks
to
prana
for
suggesting
it
this
is
an
exquisite
beverage
i
purchased
a
single
12ounce

in

i
wish
i
bought

backed
by
a

bouquet
i
could
smell
this
all
day
taste
starts
with
the
big
sugary
toffee
malt
component
not
overly
sweet
which
is
good
and
very
rich
and
brandylike
with
notes
of
ripened

alcohol
is
coming
through
some

not

pretty

is
big
but
not
cloying
and
not
too
syrupy
a
great

mmmmm
consume
this
one
all
by
itself
it
demands
respect
and
attention
i
dont
think
i
could
have
this
one
but
once
in
a
while
its
very
strong
and
not
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
fast
this
is
one
to
enjoy
talk
about
flavor
nothing
is
subtle
about
the
flavor
of
this
beer
an
initial
burn
explodes
with
a
sweet
maltiness
that
fills
your
entire
mouth
it
finishes
with
some
dry
hops
leaving
a
satisfying
balance
within
a
minute
you
feel
a
warm
glow
spread
through
your
head
and
remember
that
this
thing
comes
in
at
11

god
this
beer
tastes
good
note
i
have
6
bottles
buried
in
my
beer
cave
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
and
resist
drinking
them
to
see
how
they
hold
up
with
age
talk
about
the
anti
low
carb
diet
all
ive
been
doing
is
drinking
big
beers
these
days
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
recently
very
large
beer
i
got
way
too
much
ethanol
in
the
nose
not
very
appealing
but
the
taste
is
really
fantastic
almost
vinuous
just
good
amount
of
hops
very
malty
very
strong
i
can
feel
it
in
my
nose
after
i
swallow
almost
like
horseradish
cleanin
me
out
whewwww
i
like
this
one
a
great
beer
to
savour
and
respect
especially
on
a
cold
winter
evening
the
2003
old
stock
weighs
in
at
11
4
percent
this
year
but
can
be
deceptively
tame
as
the
alcohol
astringency
balances
with
the
mellowness
of
the
malt
and
notes
akin
to
vanilla
extract
a
deep
amber
with
hints
of
ruby
red
when
it
catches
the
light
old
stock
only
warns
that
this
isnt
a
safe
allnight
session
beer
when
it
gently
warms
the
throat
like
brandy
coffee
and
caramel
and
hops
that
stick
to
tastebuds
for
a
long
time
another
fine
offering
from
north
coast
pours
a
deep
but
clear
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
the
nose
is
sweet
with
a
symphony
of
maltinesswhisky
molasses
caramelhard
to
keep
my
nose
out
of
the
snifter
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
which
was
dominated
by
caramel
and
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
there
is
a
nice
warming
feeling
with
every
sip
that
gently
reminds
you
of
the
abv
without
it
interfering
with
the
taste
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
but
i
would
definitely
only
have
one
per
night
00
in
05
perfection
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
that
settles
quickly
smells
of
alcoholic
sweet
malt
with
a
somewhat
roasted
sensation
i
cant
quite
place
it
very
nice
quaffer
taste
is
powerful
straight
off
once
again
strongly
sweet
and
strongly
alcoholic
with
a
dark
kahlualike
hint
the
aftertaste
im
having
trouble
placing
perhaps
it
will
come
to
me
another
night
at
which
point
ill
make
an
edit
palate
is
perfect
for
the
style
slightly
carbonated
maybe
i
havent
had
a
barleywine
in
a
while
but
i
dont
think
that
is
it
suprisingly
good
as
reccomended
by
their
web
site
i
am
drinking
this
at
cellar
temperature
very
lively
pour
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
and
a
thick
rich
pale
tan
12
inch
sticky
head

with

really
good
lookin

in
the
goblet
initial
intense
tropical
fruit
burst
of
flavor
is
then
caramel
sweetness
after
this
inital
burst
of
flavor
the
brew
then
stings
the
tongue
with
a
warm
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
wonderful
comforting
smooth
full
mouth
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
high
octane
but
other
than
that
man
what
a
nicely
crafted
big
friggin
beer
beef
notes
wow
certainly
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
huge
malt
and
alcohol
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
straight
rum
but
its
not
as
harsh
vintage
2002
old
stock
ale
yeah
baby
appearance
deep
ruby
mahogany
with
a
nice
sized
cream
head
leaves
a
nice
pattern
of
scattered

rich

a

the

dont
play
a

role
here
this

wow
drinkability
its
a
winter
warmer
chill
and
enjoy
with
a
beer
over
the
course
of
at
least
45
minutes
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
you
wont
be
sorry
picked
this
2003
edition
up
on
a
whim
to
fill
out
one
of
my
three
cases
of
new
ales
from
the
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
va
this
afternoon
dont
know
what
to
expect
here
pours
into
a
large
tulip
glass
a
clear
ruby
tinted
mahogoney
brown
with
a
shortlived
beige
head
patchy
lacing
aroma
gets
my
attention
in
a
hurry
wow
lots
of
chocolate
then
lots
of
roasted
columbian
coffee
then
figs
and
raisins
a
hint
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
but
this
one
is
all
about
the
malts
im
going
to
have
to
study
up
on
this
one
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
nose
which
caught
me
by
surprise
oops
the
label
says
11
4
ok
lets
go
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
and
has
appropriate
alcohol
warming
taste
is
initially
an
assault
of
chocolate
quickly
followed
by
notes
of
coffee
peppery
spices
seem
to
be
present
as
well
dark
fruits
try
to
emerge
but
get
smothered
by
the
big
abv
this
one
is
like
a
celebrator
on
steroids
perfect
as
a
winter
warmer
this
ale
will
make
me
sleep
well
tonight
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
evening
but
this
is
one
fine
strong
dark
ale
a
bit
of
expected
oxidation
in
the
form
of
wet
paper
but
other
than
that
this
2002
vintage
is
a
freagin
rockin
example
of
an
olde
school
old
ale
overall
this
is
a
solid
old
ale
and
i
recommend
trying
now
im
on
the
fifth
bottle
of
the
2001
bottling
in
june
2006
the
vanilla
has
really
come
to
the
forefront
since
the
earlier
review
ive
picked
up
the
2004
bottling
and
i
need
to
get
the
2005
vintage
before
my
local
store
runs
out
this
stuff
is
spectacular
notes
one
of
the
few
old
ales
i
have
had
from
an
american
brewery
and
an
excellent
job
they
did
the
maltiness
hides
some
of
the
11
4
abv
and
there
seems
to
be
a
good
bit
of
balance
even
after
it
has
aged
for
a
good
while
somewhat
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
becomes
a
ring
around
the
surface
this
was
the
2002
vintage
and
the
aging
seems
to
have
served
it
well
big
malty
aroma
and
taste
it
is
deceptively
smooth
for
its
11
5
alcohol
in
fact
i
had
to
think
about
it
to
detect
the
alcohol
after
taste
and
there
was
no
burn
at
all
it
may
not
be
the
best
of
its
type
that
ive
had
but
its
very
good
overall
this
is
one
kickass
beer
old
stock
ale
2002
this
fine
ale
has
a
transluscent
browncopper
color
with
a
good
lingering
head
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
mostly
of
caramel
and
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
hop
bouquet
it
has
a
smooth
doughy
body
dominated
by
the
tastes
of
caramel
coffee
and
alcohol
these
tastes
are
tempered
a
bit
by
a
good
blending
of
hops
for
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
sweet
dry
and
warming
one
of
the
better
beers
i
came
across
in
2003
2002
edition
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
half
a
finger
of
tan
foam
there
is
very
little
lacing
left
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
spiced
rum
candied
plums
and
licorice
it
is
a
very
strong
smell
that
fills
the
nostrils
nicely
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
at
the
beginning
with
dates
figs
and
brown
sugar
there
is
a
little
bit
of
tartness
in
the
middle
like
soured
raisins
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
and
just
a
little
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
suberb
very
strong
and
very
heavy
it
glides
smooth
across
the
tongue
though
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
for
a
beer
this
strong
i
cant
wait
to
cellar
my
others
not
a
beer
youd
drink
a
ton
of
but
wonderful
on
a
cold
winters
night
one
of
the
most
drinkable
big
alcohol
beers
ive
encountered
instantly
booked
itself
a
permanent
spot
in
my
cellar
this
beer
is
amazing
dont
fear
the
price
tag
it
is
really
worth
the
money
you
would
not
believe
that
this
beer
is
11
5
abv
while
drinking
and
reviewing
this
to
notes
i
considered
giving
this
beer
nearly
all
fives
enchanting
poured
a
wonderful
deep
brown
color
with
just
a
small
amount
of
head
nice
aroma
with
so
many
smell
floating
around
but
well
balanced
so
that
one
doesnt
overpower
the
other
the
taste
is
malty
and
hoppy
i
find
that
mmost
old
style
ales
have
a
large
bite
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
but
this
one
is
nice
and
smooth
though
it
is
a
loarge
beer
it
is
so
smooth
you
would
never
know
a
wonderful
well
balanced
beer
i
cant
wait
to
pick
up
another
one
poured
an
extravagant
deep
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
thats
to
be
expected
with
11
4
abv
the
beer
coated
the
glass
with
cobwebs
of
lacing
the
aroma
released
malts
and
caramels
with
fruits
and
sugars
sneaking
around
as
well
the
taste
was
inviting
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
too
strong
it
hid
very
well
in
his
complex
beer
and
that
can
be
difficult
to
do
this
beer
was
still
very
young
a
very
nice
offering
and
a
great
example
to
cellar
2yr
old
bottle
amber
body
with
ruby
tones
small
fading
head
rapidly
becomes
a
memory
the
aroma
is
pretty
complex
like
any
respectable
barleywine
but
definitely
more
on
the
malt
side
brown
sugar
is
obvious
and
is
of
pleasant
company
to
figs
peaches
alcohol
and
an
allaround
complex
fruitiness
taste
is
an
infinite
malty
deepness
that
is
only
restrained
by
a
tad
too
much
alcohol
presence
for
my
liking
syrupy
apricot
and
sweet
peaches
the
aftertaste
is
fresh
like
i
had
brushed
my
teeths
with
an
alcohol
flavoured
toothpaste
medium
bodied
and
fullflavoured
just
a
little
too
sweetcloying
to
be
among
the
greats
of
this
world
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
yet
very
fruity
as
well
although
this
is
by
no
means
a
fruity
beer
surprisingly
its
very
refreshing
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
which
makes
this
very
drinkable
but
it
still
lets
you
know
whos
boss
very
excellent
and
very
underrated
north
coast
will
continue
to
get
more
of
my
flow
so
long
as
they
keep
bringing
me
quality
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
big
and
tastey
yet
very
drinkable
i
was
distressed
when
brews
sold
out
of
third
coast
old
ale
while
i
was
sitting
at
the
bar
then
the
bartender
pulled
this
gem
out
thanks
to
brews
cafe
for
aging
this
one
for
me
for
the
last
year
it
pours
an
old
worn
leathery
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
a
sweet
toffee
aroma
and
big
warming
alcohol
fuminess
is
quite
noticeable
throughout
the
glass
a
light
citrus
and
mild
coffee
aroma
are
also
constantly
in
the
background
pronounced
toffee
coffee
with
cream
and
milk
chocolate
blend
nicely
with

compound
this
is
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
in
the
extreme
class
boy
did
it
ever
this
beer
smells
scary
like
its
going
to
kill
your
taste
buds
and
burn
your
throat
all
to
hell
but
after
the
first
swig
trust
ensues
you
can
still
sense
the
strong
abv
but
this
ale
is
extremely
smooth
and
flavorful
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
just
take
it
slow
and
easy
it
will
reveal
its
mysteries
near
the
end
of
the
story
one
just
has
to
have
restraint
of
eagerness
about
how
quickly
they
get
to
the
end
drinkability
hindered
by
the
inadequate
alcohol
masking
ive
had
stronger
abv
beers
that
mask
better
i
think
this
stuff
needs
to
age
some
more

really
sweet

with
a

and
quite
smooth
this
is
a
fantastic
old
ale
for
sipping
purposes
only
drinkability
suffers
however
due
to
the
heavily
concentrated
alcohol
that
lurks
beneath
each
sip
this
is
a
fairly
wellbalanced
strong
ale
and
certainly
one
that
ill
return
to
after
its
had
additional
time
to
mature
the
color

gives
plenty
to

nevertheless
it
rinses
cleanly
across
the
palate
leaving
a
glaze
of
perfumy
magic
quite
impressive
to
drink
now
for
all
of
its
exquisite
balance
a
quality
missing
from
so
many
american
strong
ales
barleywines
etc
still
i
think
this
will
only
improve
over
the
next

is
sweet

with
a
hint

to
it
taste
is
sweet
with
a
brandied

like
flavor
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable

with
a
very
noticible

bite
backwash
might
be
perfect
if
mixed
5050
with
some
old
horizontal

liquid

the
high
alcohol
content
gave
this
beer
a
nice
warming
effect
just
what
i
needed
in
this
107
degree
weather
this
was
a
very
good
strong
ale
it
had
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
that
complimented
each
other
well
im
just
glad
that
it
only
came
in
a
12
oz
bottle
otherwise
at
11

abv
i
would
be
taking
a
nap
right
now
instead
of
writing
this
review
the
taste
is
similarly
heavy
on
dark
fruit
flavors
with
nice
alcohol
presence
that
pulls
the
flavor
up
through
the
nose
it
finishes
with
a
nice
oily
hop
bite
but
this
is
wellbalanced
by
a
caramel
sweetness
that
makes
this
beer
a
little
more
drinkable
for
me
than
sierras
bigfoot
for
example
really
a
well
crafted
beer
ill
leave
one
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
it
ages
fizzy
tan
head
dissappered
immediatly
after
pouring
this
beautiful
deep
burgundy
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
thin
streams
aroma
is
intense
as
it
is
full
of
sweet
malt
with
fruity
esters
and
a
little
hopiness
to
make
the
aroma
very
splendid
flavor
is
even
better
than
the
aroma
as
it
starts
with
a
little
bit
of
roasted
flavor
that
transitions
into
sweet
malt
and
huge
alcohol
flavors
hopiness
is
very
noticible
yet
it
balances
this
brew
quite
nicely
mouthfeel
is
heavy
which
goes
well
with
the
lingering
hopiness
and
the
fruity
esters
overall
this
is
an
excellent
old
ale
which
i
will
be
sure
to
put
a
couple
bottles
in
my
cellar
for
aging

to
weefishheads
originally
sampled

2002
a
reddishbrown
pour
w
a
quickly
dissipating
yellowtan
head
the
alcohol
is
completely
disguised
by
a
slightly
sweet
taste
a
flavor
almost
like
a
dessert
wine
this
is
a
sipping
beer
period
lovely
hide
a
bottle
away
until
next
year
i
have
had
some
great
barleywines
recently
and
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
such
as
smuttynoses
big
beer
series
exceptionally
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
ive
had
a
few
different
brews
from
north
coast
and
although
a
good
brewery
i
dont
think
they
stack
up
to
others
in
cal
like
stone
alesmith
and
bear
republic
to
name
a
few
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
barley
wine
with
all
the
classic
characteristics
such
as
the
sweet
alcohol
nose
and
rich
malt
flavor
very
even
throughout
but
nothing
outstanding
perhaps
this
bottle
2001
might
smooth
out
if
cellared
will
have
to
wait
and
see
excellent
example
of
the
style
good
balance
between
hops
and
malt
with
an
edge
to
the
malt
powerful
and
smooth
without
being
too
boozy
a
great
warmer
nice
to
have
a
micro
that
isnt
dominated
by
hops
thanks
north

ill
buy
this
every
time
i
see
it
2002
bottle
pours
a
dark

throughout
the
glass
thick
and
foamy
beige
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
strong
malt
and
alcohol
with
lesser
portions
of
hops
and

rich

and
it
tasted
somewhere
between
a
scotch
ale
and
barley
wine
excellent
blend
of
malt
vanilla
alcohol
and
caramel

is
all

and
tart

good
beer
overall
a
good
way
to
reward
a
hard
cold
day
thanks
to
jaybeerman
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
cloudy
amberredorange
color
the
head
was
beige
in
color
fairly
thick
and
foamy
the
lace
was
barely
there
the
aroma
was
a
whole
cornucopia
of
smells
all
stuffed
into
the
little
bottle
i
smelled
simply
the
following
items
swirling
in
my
glass
sweet
and
tart
granny
smith
apples
alcohol
sweet
malt
baked
apple
pie
with
sugar
topping
some
other
dark
fruits
sandlewood
like
a
barrel
that
held
apple
cidar
was
used
some
nuts
and
again
alcohol
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
that
it
was
strong
and
thick
and
the
first
sip
was
full
of
flavors
waiting
to
be
discovered
i
tasted
sweet
malts
baked
apple
pie
alcohol
kind
of
woody
like
it
was
aged
in
an
oak
barrel
that
was
used
to
hold
apples
or
other
fruits
nuts
and
roasted
malts
roasted
sugars
and
a
sweet
hint
of
cocoa
this
beer
was
bitty
all
through
out
a
warm
alcohol
glow
filled
my
body
afterwards
it
left
me
feeling
warm
and
fuzzy
this
is
a
definite
sipping
beer
awesome
dark
amberruby
in
color
with
a
tight
head
formed
by
slowly
rising
carbonation
malt
dominated
somewhat
nutty
aroma
with
light
fruity
notes
almost
strawberrylike
but
very
unobtrusive
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightly
coating
and
the
flavor
starts
with
a
toasty
toffeelike
maltiness
this
gives
way
to
a
slightly
nutty
midpalate
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
and
a
mildly
citric
hop
finish
aftertaste
is
pleasantly
toasty
all
in
all
this
is
a
quite
decent
ale
though
not
the
brewerys
best
and
not
really
a
standout
among
the
selection
of
barley
wines
available
today
chestnut
red
with
a
slight
haze
it
pours
with
a
minimal
tan
head
that
remains
as
a
thin
ring
of
foam
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
no
lacing
to
speak
of
a
somewhat
nutty
plum
scent
dominates
the
aroma
just
a
wonderful
toasted
malt
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
as
expected
but
again
the
nutty
component
is
very
prevalent
nice
plum
and
cherry
fruits
appear
along
with
a
biscuit
malt
flavor
some
hops
clean
up
the
finsh
and
present
a
lingering
bitterness
the
minimal
carbonation
contributes
to
the
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
surprisingly
good
for
the
abv
this
is
one
fine
barleywine
this
is
one
pretty
amazing
brew
its
complex
and
strong
with
a
wonderful
warming
effect
the
alcohol
is
there
but
very
well
hidden
for
11

i
love
this
thing
pours
a
clear
but
dark
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
a
112
finger
light
tan
head
the
smell
consists
of
light
fresh
baked
sweet
bread
notes
it
smells
very
good
the
taste
also
reveals
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
also
yields
roasted
malts
sharp
hops
and
lots
of
alcohol
at

abv
theres
just
not
much
covering
this
up
blended
nicely
in
this
medium
bodied
creamy
brew
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
whew
this
is
put
together
very
well
cheers
this
one
is
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
ever
tasted
on
draft
the
nose
reminds
me
of
a
hennessey
xo
cognac
the
alcohol
smell
is
very
strong
and
usually
something
i
dont
enjoy
as
much
in
the
nose
this
one
is
the
exception
though
i
love
good
cognac
therefore
the
nose
is
exceptional
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
also
exceptional
the
cognac
like
nose
lends
to
the
flavor
and
they
are
right
the
warmer
this
barley
wine
the
better
it
tastes
the
after
taste
is
fruity
and
not
bitter
like
many
barley
wines
i
have
tried
according
to
their
web
site
this
is
a
vintage
limited
run
of
12000
cases
so
i
would
grab
the
bottles
while
you
can
but
if
you
can
get
the
draft
man
you
are
in
for
a
treat
now
that
ive
let
the
beer
warm
to
room
temps
i
can
also
pick
up
some
raisin
flavors
though
the
alcohol
presence
has
increased
like
i
said
ill
rereview
soon
to
verify
these
results
this
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
red
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
off
white
head
that
subsided
quickly
and
left
a
small
amount
of
lace
some
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
fruit
a
flavor
of
malt
and
fruit
with
some
of
the
alcohol
present
as
well
not
bad
for
a
barleywine
but
probably
could
use
some
cellaring
2002

dark
ruby

with
a
beige

which
unfortunately
doesnt
stay
that
well
but
that
can
be
expected
with
this

aroma
of
berries
and
nuts
definitely
some
cherry
in
there
maybe
a
little
soaked
wood
as
well
alcohol
is
definitely
present
the
flavor
is
hopinfused
berries
and
raisins
with
pretty
big

that

and

with
a

and

twang
on
the

bittersweet
is

description
this
is
a
great
barleywine
but
i
find
it
odd
that
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
bottle
conditioned
i
think
all
barleywines
are
just
perfect
for
bottle
conditioning
still
i
imagine
that
you
could
cellar
it
and
get
some
good
results
in
fact
i
think
it
could
stand
a
little
cellaring
before
tasting
very
nice
as
is
though

i
love
a
good
barley
wine
and
this
one
is
in
that
category
i
plan
to
lay
several
down
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
how
they
mature
a
nice

around
the

an
almost
pralinelike

side

fence
reviewed
again
over
a
year
later
on
011904
this
has
met
expecations
as
far
as
aging
goes
the
head
and
carbonation
have
diminished
but
the
flavor
has
certainly
improved
the
alcohol
smell
and
taste
have
mellowed
a
bit
allowing
dark
fruit
to
dominate
completely
raisin
and
date
with
just
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
enough
hop
bitterness
remains
to
keep
things
in
check
in
hindsight
i
felt
that
i
overrated
it
when
i
originally
reviewed
it
but
it
has
aged
so
well
that
i
have
no
qualms
about
notching
up
the
ratings
on
taste
and
drinkability
i
was
certainly
lucky
to
run
across
a
large
stash
of
the
02
os
in
early
04
i
am
drinking
an
old
beer
and
listening
to
old
records
like
the
replacements
a
winter
warmer
that
im
drinking
by
the
stereo
with
memories
rather
than
the

buttery

profile
accompanied
by

of
a

when
coupled
with
the

an
impression
of

3rd

ale
this
2001
vintage
bottle
was
supplied
compliments
of
a
butcher
at
a
whole
foods
market
color
appeared
to
be
a
deep
red
with
orange
hues
head
was
tan
and
lacing
was
good
this
beer
had
a
very
strong
fruity
nose
plums
and
pears
not
surprisingly
the
taste
was
very
smooth
with
a
strong
alcoholic
kick
good
rounded
mouth
feel
and
for
such
a
powerful
ale
quite
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
of
brew
but
very
good
nonetheless
a
potent
warming
ale
perfect
for
a
gloomy
rainy
day
addition
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
tis
brew
and
consider
it
one
of
the
great
beers
available
to
us
the
2006
vintage
aged
one
year
has
done
it
for
me
ultra
smooth
warming
enjoyable
the
ultimate
sipping
ale
maybe
all
i
know
is
it
is
stupendous
cheers
to
north
coast
for
making
a
wonderful
barleywine
a
beauitful
dark
copper
color
with
very
little
foam
in
the
glass
the
aroma
shows
a
fruity
and
spicy
flair
with
a
hint
of
carmel
this
ale
tastes
what
the
aroma
smells
like
plus
complex
aroma
and
taste
is
what
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
is
not
over
bearing
or
powerful
and
the
bitterness
on
the
after
taste
and
palate
is
well
balanced
with
a
hit
of
sweetness
drink
at
room
temperature
if
cold
it
just
doesnt
have
the
flavor
aroma
and
compexity
it
should
have
storing
up
on
this
beer
going
for
a
weekend
drive
to
ft
bragg
if
i
cant
find
this
locally
this
ale

the
aroma
starts
with
dark
fruit
alcohol
a
touch
of
sweet
maltiness
and
some
light
hop
character
the
color
is
brownish
with
some
crimson
tints
the
head
starts
fairly
creamy
with
a
light
beige
color
but
dissipates
quickly
as
expected
in
a
high
alcohol
beer
the
flavor
starts
with
a
burst
of
sharp
dark
fruit
and
malt
followed
by
a
fairly
heavy
touch
of
alcohol
and
then
a
drying
hop
character
which
is
somewhat
aggressive
but
far
from
overwhelming
the
finish
is
dry
but
one
sided
an
excellent
beer
but
its
no
samiclaus
or
thomas
hardys
either
an
excellent
beer
from
an
excellent
brewery

well
i
am
laying
the
rest
of
this
4pack
down
and
after
tasting
this
one
i
am
going
to
be
having
dreams
about
what
they
will
be
like
it
poured
a
great
deep
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
a
creamy
head
that
faded
a
bit
faster
than
i
would
have
liked
it
smells
very
malty
with
alcohol
undertones
in
it
the
taste
is
all
malt
from
the
first
sip
till
you
swallow
a
huge
malt
character
that
almost
completely
drowns
out
the
alcohol
a
different
kind
of
malt
sweetness
than
a
double
bock
tend
to
be
too
sweet
for
me
or
the
wrong
kind
of
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
sticky
and
it
completely
coats
your
entire
mouth
and
tongue
with
its
flavor
i
think
as
young
as
this
is
i
could
still
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
a
class
brew
it
should
dry
out
a
little
as
it
ages
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
is
doing
around
next
christmas
sorry
matt
but
this
one
did
not
score
with
me
great
bronzeruby
color
but
the
flavor
was
an
overwhelming
bittersweetness
that
coated
my
tongue
so
that
i
could
not
get
any
other
dimension
from
the
beer
at
a
whopping
11
4
abv
i
did
not
even
get
any
spicyness
from
the
alcohol
perhaps
this
beer
will
integrate
the
flavor
over
time
and
develop
more
character
but
for
the
time
being
it
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
mean
beer
i
dont
know
of
any
other
domestic
old
ale
to
compare
this
to
but
this
one
rocks
the
carbonation
was
a
little
low
even
for
the
style
but
maybe
that
will
improve
with
age
huge
malty
and
smooth
unlike
some
old
ales
this
one
is
good
now
and
it
should
continue
to
get
better
for
at
least
3
if
not
5
years
although
a
touch
sweet
it
is
not
overly
so
and
it
should
dry
out
if
you
age
it
if
you
can
get
this
one
make
sure
and
pick
up
some
so
you
can
put
them
down
overall
a
really
great
take
on
a
barrel
aged
stock
ale
big
bourbon
flavor
with
a
great
mix
of
toasty
malt
and
dark
fruit
notes
pricey
but
it
arguable
lives
up
to
it
awesome
stuff
drinks
a
litle
hot
with
the
bourbon
but
still
really
good
and
has
good
balance
truly
a
brew
for
bourbon
lovers
this
is
absolutely
amazing
complex
and
deep
layered
and
strong
unforgiving
and
uncompromising
i
have
major
complaints
in
the
look
and
mouthfeel
department
but
the
beer
more
than
makes
up
for
it
on
the
palate
o
this
has
aged
well
for
6
years
it
could
probably
still
go
another
handful
of
years
at
least
depending
on
ones
preferences
if
you
like
the
aged
thomas
hardy
or
j
w
lees
vintages
you
will
find
some
common
ground
here
old
stock
is
one
of
the
only
american
made
old
ales
that
can
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
those
doesnt
look
like
much
as
it
pours
a
murky
brown
with
an
off
white
wispy
head
aroma
of
vanilla
oak
bourbon
figs
plums
and
countless
other
dark
fruits
flavor
explodes
with
vanilla
bark
and
booze
delicious
comes
off
a
little
hot
but
i
dont
mind
i
dont
care
for
the
base
ive
tried
and
tried
but
i
just
dont
but
something
magical
happens
when
it
hit
barrels
just
a
notch
bellow
the
brandy
version
but
still
fantastic
overall
for
a
strong
ale
it
is
good
another
one
that
could
benefit
from
cellaring
this
beer
is
all
barrel
the
high
ratings
are
ridiculous
no
nuance
you
would
be
better
off
getting
a
bottle
of
cheap
bourbon
only
for
abv
and
ba
nerds
o
is
it
worth
the
hefty
pricetag
probably
it
is
so
well
made
not
exactly
flying
off
the
shelves
like
most
limited
release
ba
beers
so
ill
probably
grab
another
to
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
this
a
fine
barrel
aged
product
but
not
an
excellent
old
ale
as
reflected
in
the
many
other
reviews
its
late
so
ill
fill
in
the
details
in
a
few
days
from
my
notes
this
is
a
delicious
upgrade
from
your
standard
old
stock
ale
the
barrel
aging
really
adds
a
couple
of
layers
of
delicious
to
this
brew
my
only
real
objection
is
the
price
still
im
going
to
go
out
and
buy
another
bottle
or
two
on
payday
o
this
was
a
treat
ive
loved
old
stock
ale
but
cellar
reserve
is
a
step
above
so
good
malt
forward
with
a
slowly
developing
yet
ultimately
satisfying
bourbon
tinged
finish
bold
complex
and
deeply
satisying
o
a
great
ba
brew
very
tasty
500ml
was
the
right
size
its
pricey
but
worth
a
try
t
this
base
beer
is
so
amazing
i
really
dont
think
you
can
do
wrong
with
it
its
fantastic
alone
its
great
in
brandy
barrels
and
this
is
amazing
as
well
caramel
toasted
biscuit
and
a
good
amount
of
bourbon
the
finish
brings
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
but
it
gives
just
a
touch
of
dryness
rather
than
burning
the
hell
out
of
you
14
what

may
like
the

that
was

this
was
beyond
that
highly
recommend
letting
this
beer
age
as
it
becomes
truly
exceptional
updating
with
a
2013
edition
and
the
fresher
bottle
is
superior
and
world
class
just
delicious
get
as
many
of
these
as
you
can
find
2009
bottle
simply
amazing
can
barely
tell
its
bourbon
barrel
aged
but
the
taste
is
heavenly
i
wish
that
i
had
another
23
bottles
on
had
to
experience
with
time
a
pleasant
surprise
as
the
beer
has
wonderful
complexities
and
drinkability
o
overall
a
solid
old
ale
may
have
waited
a
bit
long
on
this
one
as
the
bourbon
is
awfully
mildmellow
still
a
tasty
old
ale
though
not
quite
worth
the
price
for
the
bottle
size
overall
an
amazing
beer
the
barrel
aging
and
then
further
cellaring
has
done
wonders
for
this
super
flavorful
and
complex
and
while
it
still
packs
a
nice
boozy
punch
it
goes
down
smooth
as
hell
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
but
thats
only
a
minor
complaint
this
could
probably
continue
to
age
but
i
cant
imagine
itll
get
much
better
than
it
is
now
definitely
trade
for
this
one
if
you
can
o
a
tremendous
beer
im
almost
regretting
the
decision
to
open
it
must
find
another

seeking

to
try
this
one
m
the

nearly
perfect

thinner
than
expected
with

this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
trying
but
why
the
30
price
tag
this
beer
is
exceptional
i
didnt
have
it
fresh
which
i
guess
was
already
2
years
old
but
id
imagine
it
has
mellowed
if
its
this
smooth
now
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
are
a
great
point
right
now
i
cant
imagine
itd
get
better
than
it
is
now
but
i
also
dont
think
a
few
more
years
will
make
it
terrible
o
very
interesting
barrel
aged
old
ale
it
has
held
up
well
for
the
past
45
years
very
sweet
very
heavy
due
to
a
high
abv
and
low
carbonation
a
sipper
for
sure
luckily
this
is
only
a
16
9
ounce
bottle
it
would
be
tough
to
drink
a
750
of
this
stuff
are
you
listening
bruery
dessert
beer
for
sure
not
far
from
drinking
pure
spirits
i
wish
the
old
ale
aspect
stood
out
a
little
more
even
after
the
years
this
ones
barrel
presence
is
a
bit
overpowering
maybe
it
just
needs
a
few
more
years
to
balance
out
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
but
couldnt
give
it
the
higher
scores
that
are
typical
an
absolutely
wonderful
beer
that
has
aged
well
over
the
past
four
years
o
worth
the
high
price
charged
and
could
probably
be
cellared
a
few
more
years
but
doesnt
need
to
be
bottle
is
attractive
you
can
tell
that
north
coast
is
proud
of
this
beauty
definitely
a
good
purchase
o
this
is
a
stunning
creation
reminds
me
of
the
bruery
anniversary
beers
but
certainly
its
own
creation
certainly
not
falling
off
at
all
i
imagine
this
one
could
cellar
for
another
5
years
at
least
its
a
big
brew
but
not
as
big
as
its
drinking
today
considering
the
age
id
expect
it
to
have
mellowed
a
little
more
then
it
has
ive
drank
bigger
beers
younger
and
the
had
less
booze
burn
i
was
loving
the
nose
and
perhaps
that
got
my
hopes
up
a
little
it
takes
a
lot
for
me
to
give
a
beer
a
perfect
rating
but
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
ever
produced
by
human
hands
is
it
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
it
comes
close
its
not
cheap
but
im
most
likely
going
to
go
back
and
buy
the
other
two
bottle
in
stock
at
my
local
swill
merchant
tomorrow
this
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
up
front
and
alot
of
potential
but
ultimately
isnt
excellent
all
around
perhaps
i
would
prefer
some
more
bitterness
for
balance
and
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
also
need
some
work
overall
a
nice
brew
but
not
worth
20
for
a
small
bottle
d
good
super
mellow
highly
drinkable
plenty
of
complexity
without
being
too
big
which
is
impressive
considering
this
big
time
abv
ready
to
be
taken
out
of
the
cellar
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
toffee
bourbon
and
wood
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
great
barrel
aged
aromas
and
flavors
o
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
absolutely
astounding
complexity
and
balance
in
the
flavor
and
an
aroma
that
id
love
to
be
able
to
smell
every
day
of
my
life
please
release
another
batch
of
this
asap
quick
edit
i
dont
like
the
beeradvocate
system
for
rating
because
the
beer
right
now
has
an
average
of
98
i
gave
it
a
97
on
my
blog
but
my
rating
here
says
i
gave
it
roughly
7
higher
than
the
average
rating
ba
inflates
thats
stupid
but
then
again
their
rating

isnt

at

they

dear
lord
but
would
recommend
if
you
havent
tried
and
have
a
chance
you
must
oi
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
was
kind
of
a
let
down
perhaps
its
because
i
enjoyed
fruet
2
days
ago
this
one
pales
in
comparison
overall
everything
i
love
about
old
stock
with
bourbon
cant
beat
it
pretty
good
a
great
winter
sipper
price
sucks
but
worth
it
i
love
the
flavor
of
this
beer
i
continue
to
get
flavor
akin
to
the
bouquet
notes
in
addition
i
got
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
these
flavors
coat
the
mouth
with
each
sip
i
recommend
this
beer
by
a
fire
from
a
snifter
they
pair
very
well
dont
forget
the
smokers
jacket
a
monster
beer
with
loads
of
complexities
with
the
age
and
the
typical
character
of
the
base
it
seems
more
like
port
than
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
still
well
done
recommended
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
fleeting
finger
of
taupe
foam
leaving
an
etched

is
immaculate

bourbon
vanilla
fine

some

toasting
flavor
is
rich
and
decadent
with
some
maple
bourbon
vanilla
rich
malts
some
really
nice
sugars
and
a
caramel
flavor
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
i
really
dig
this
beer
o
sweet
and
carmel
heavy
with
a
small
booze
kick
o
this
smells
and
tastes
great
the
barrelaging
is
stellar
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
high
though
i
waxed
poetic
on
this
even
further
on
my
blog

its
a
real
expensive
beer
so
i
only
see
myself
at
20
a
pop
same
price
per
oz
as
black
tuesday
buying
a
bottle
of
this
every
510
years
probably
overall
too
bad
the
palat
was
so
lousy
as
it
really
didnt
support
the
flavors
like
it
needed
to
the
base
beer
wasnt
killed
by
the
barrels
in
this
one
but
the
palate
just
couldnt
bring
everything
into
harmony
the
look
really
suffered
here
as
well
with
an
unatractive
and
fizzy
head
making
a
lousy
first
impression
id
much
rather
have
the
2007
base
beer
again
though
if
they
carbonated
this
one
right
itd
be
really
nice
o
this
is
a
great
sipper
i
smelled
this
forever
before
i
finally
took
a
drink
i
enjoyed
this
one
immensely
and
it
is
definitely
in
the
top
five
old
ales
ive
ever
had
the
barrel
is
nicely
integrated
and
helps
create
another
layer
of
flavor
that
definitely
compliments
the
base
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
had
initially
turned
down
buying
this
because
of
its
price
tag
but
great
traders
matttyce
and
centennial
both
sent
be
a
bottle
as
an
extra
dont
know
whos
i
just
drank
even
after
receiving
this
for
free
it
still
took
me
almost
a
year
to
finally
crack
it
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
if
you
have
the
chance
to
trade
for
this
or
just
pick
it
up
off
the
shelf
do
it
you
wont
regret
it
o
great
age
the
integration
complexity
booze
and
fruit
are
spot
on
overall
this
is
a
pretty
smackable
rendition
of
old
stock
the
bourbon
was
very
warming
on
the
initial
sip
but
as
it
warms
the
complexities
from
all
of
the
flavors
shine
thru
glad
i
splurged
give
it
a
shot
if
you
got
the
coin
and
like
the
style
drinkability
a
fairly
decent
bourbon
beer
as
previously
mentioned
just
a
little
too
much
bourbon
aftertaste
overall
i
cannot
call
this
a
winner
in
my
book
only
because
it
is
a
bourbon
bomb
still
after
3
years
the
base
beer
is
such
a
solid
offering
that
the
barrel
aging
totally
dominates
the
flavor
profile
the
base
old
stock
only
acts
as
a
canvas
for
the
bourbon
with
so
much
bourbon
flavor
i
could
just
drink
bourbon
especially
for
the
elevated
costsmall
quantity
of
this
brew
o
its
been
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
wonderful
old
ale
when
done
right
old
ales
are
in
my
top
favorite
style
to
drink
and
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
the
only
downfall
to
this
beer
is
its
price
point
but
we
all
need
to
treat
ourselves
sometimes
find
this
one
and
enjoy
o
had
this
with
a
friend
both
liked
it
very
much
worth
the
23
i
paid
almost
reminds
me
of
a
samuel
adams
utopias
except
a
little
watered
down
in
flavor
def
pick
this
up
overall
this
is
about
what
i
was
expectinghoping
for
layers
of
richness
and
complexity
hopefully
only
enhanced
by
3
years
in
the
bottle
not
an
everyday
beer
by
any
stretch
but
a
tasty
decadent
treat
1500
drinkability
well
damn
for
how
high
abv
it
is
and
how
fresh
i
opened
this
bottle
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
yes
it
cost
a
freaking
ton
but
i
am
glad
i
have
another
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
surprisingly
worth
the
cost
well
done
originally
reviewed
04052011
as
an
underaged
college
student
with
such
a
pricey
beer
i
had
to
steal
this
bottle
from
safeway
it
was
well
worth
the
swoop
i
really
enjoyed
the
savory
bourbon
flavors
everyone
wanted
a
sip
from
this
bottle
but
it
wasnt
available
for
sharing
i
would
definitely
take
this
bottle
from
safeway
again
this
is
an
odd
brew
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
are
plentiful
but
the
other
flavors
are
subtle
it
has
an
earthy
dark
taste
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
hands
down
i
love
every
little
bit
of
complexity
it
evoked
as
it
delved
into
my
new
favorite
style
especially
its
emphasis
on
barrel
flavors
but
man
that
price
tag
is
killing
my
wallet
i
think
the
next
300
beers
need
a
spending
limit
this
was
a
great
beer
but
with
the
price
tag
its
hard
to
say
it
was
worth
it
knowing
that
it
tastes
similar
to
the
barleywine
i
referenced
and
knowing
i
can
get
that
for
a
little
bit
cheaper
price
and
can
get
it
once
a
year
i
may
remember
this
old
ale
fondly
but
it
wont
quite
go
to
the
top
of
my
list
drink
highly
drinkable
with
a
lot
of
layers
going
on
malty
vanilla
oak
bourbon
glad
i
finally
got
one
o
okay
but
not
very
special
definitely
not
worth
the
high
price
o
delicious
what
a
spectacular
beer
sure
this
was
a
bit
pricey
when
i
purchased
it
i
think
around
1820
but
ill
be
damned
if
i
didnt
have
to
pick
my
jaw
up
off
the
floor
a
superlative
achievement
that
reaches
the
lofty
heights
of
the
style
a
round
of
applause
for
north
coast
and
this
mammoth
creation
rich
dark
amber
in
color
to
a
very
dark
brown
near
black
tamed
aromatics
although
bittering
levels
can
greatly
vary
expect
common
fruity
vinous
intense
malts
and
sharp
alcohol
characteristics
the
often
racy
but
mellow
attitude
of
the
beer
may
also
include
acidic
notes
raisins
and
black
currants
vintage
varieties
may
have
a
low
level
of
oxidation
stronger
versions
may
have
similarities
to
a
port
wine
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
the
barrel
aging
was
really
well
done
it
stands
out
but
doesnt
completely
dominate
the
bourbon
was
very
flavorful
and
smooth
and
was
the
perfect
compliment
to
the
base
beer
it
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
and
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
on
it
this
evening
id
say
it
deserves
to
be
mentioned
with
the
best
of
the
style
taste
starts
out
with
a
boozy
warmth
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
hit
first
followed
by
a
subtle
oak
woodiness
bourbon
has
a
large
presence
throughout
tad
on
the
sweeter
side
but
the
strong
booziness
masks
it
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
but
at
least
this
isnt
lost
abbey
o
this
is
a
delicious
and
well
balanced
behemoth
of
a
brew
the
price
tag
is
definitely
hefty
but
it
is
worth
a
try
doa
i
dont
think
this
is
quite
as
good
as
the
regular
but
its
still
quite
the
treat
overall
great
malt
profile
on
this
beer
that
is
perfectly
complimented
with
near
perfect
barrel
aging
this
is
hands
down
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
old
ale
that
i
have
drank
north
coast
really
does
barrel
aging
well
old
raspy
anniversary
beers
are
top
notch
just
like
this
beer
i
only
wish
that
north
coast
would
drop
the
price
a
little
bit
on
these
beers
because
they
are
quite
expensive
this
is
a
big
malty
beer
that
i
am
enjoying
a
lot
as
i
empty
my
glass
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
a
bottle
o
fantastic
barrel
aged
old
ale
flavors
really
well
integrated
with
barrel
character
its
hard
to
get
past
the
unfortunate
price
tag
i
know
but
if
youve
seen
this
lingering
on
the
shelf
for
the
past
year
and
a
half
and
have
been
tempted
pick
one
upyou
wont
be
disappointed
overall
4
5
the
2009
old
stock
cellar
reserve
loses
points
in
my
book
due
to
its
absent
head
in
the
glass
as
well
as
its
bizarre
willingness
to
carbonate
to
excess
in
the
mouth
beyond
that
this
is
one
of
the
finest
tasting
and
overall
best
strong
old
ales
that
i
have
ever
enjoyed
and
is
certainly
a
worldclass
offering
my
hat
is
off
to
north
coast
for
improving
upon
their
already
topshelf
old
stock
ale
if
you
have
a
taste
for
strong
ales
barrel
aged
ales
bourbon
or
barley
wines
then
you
are
doing
yourself
a
disservice
if
you
havent
tried
this
magnificent
beer
it
is
certainly
worth
the
sticker
price
here
in
cali
only
15
99
at
my
local
boozeofallkindsbazaar
o
took
me
a
while
to
finish
the
bottle
of
this
stuff
a
very
unique
taste
and
special
brew
i
aged
my
bottle
for
two
years
was
well
worth
it
o
cant
believe
i
let
this
sit
on
shelves
for
as
long
as
i
did
excellent
beer
overall
even
at
21
for
a
330ml
bottle
or
so
this
is
fantastic
probably
not
worth
the
price
but
pretty
great
excellent
pairing
with
aged
gouda
o
great
beer
but
damn
26
for
a
500ml
bottle
is
steep
and
very
few
beers
are
actually
worth
that
price
tag
not
having
had
this
beer
before
i
was
happy
to
make
the
purchase
but
would
be
reluctant
to
make
it
a
repeat
unless
it
were
in
the
15
range
wont
lie
this
is
a
great
beer
but
its
hard
to
justify
the
price
really
opens
with
warmth
oak
and
bourbon
and
caramel
syrup
love
old
stock
and
with
bourbon
its
pretty
awesome
o
a
boozy
bourbon
bomb
but
still
warms
you
on
a
cold
dayquite
the
beer
uncorks
like
a
champagne
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
thick
crystal
clear
amber
color
little
head
or
lace
scent
is
intoxicating
like
caramel
vapor
tasted
like
oaked
candy
with
caramel
notes
and
a
nutty
undertone
almost
a
tawny
port
feel
this
is
a
tasty
after
dinner
beer
certainly
not
a
sessiontype
beverage
but
well
worth
the
price
of
the
bottle
feel
was
smooth
and
clean
overall
id
have
this
again
and
recommend
keeping
a
few
bottles
in
the
cellar
very
nice
beer
twentythree
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
to
spend
on
a
16
9
fl
oz
bottle
of
beer
but
my
girlfriend
and
i
thought
that
old
stock
cellar
reserve
was
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
this
is
barrelaging
at
its
finest
dr
for
the
high
abv
its
quite
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
that
its
at
all
an
improvement
upon
the
old
stock
ale
which
in
the
orange
county
store
i
purchased
these
beers
at
was
only
3
99
compared
to
this
versions
hefty
22
95
price
tag
i
dont
notice
any
benefits
of
aging
while
overall
its
an
enjoyable
beer
unfortunately
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
original
its
high
price
point
and
disappointing
quality
should
turn
off
most
beer
fanatics
im
regretful
i
took
the
plunge
for
this
one
but
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
this
was
the
2013
vintage
old
stock
cellar
o
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
and
it
has
definitely
lived
up
to
my
expectations
really
shows
how
taking
an
already
great
beer
and
throwing
it
in
a
barrel
yields
phenomenal
results
north
coast
succeeds
again
with
this
bourbon
barrel
offering
overall
this
beer
is
very
smooth
i
imagine
aging
in
bourbon
barrels
really
mellows
this
beer
out
i
originally
thought
this
was
a
2011
brew
but
after
realizing
its
2009
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
makes
more
sense
i
imagine
the
alcohol
and
bourbon
burn
is
more
apparent
for
a
young
brew
so
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
would
do
this
beer
a
great
deal
of
good
o
a
very
nice
beer
not
hot
or
boozy
like
the
bbl
version
much
more
than
the
regular
version
too
bad
the
beer
is
so
expensive
love
the
cool
bottle
but
have
to
assume
that
it
adds
to
the
price
so
why
bother
o
exceeded
my
expectations
the
bourbon
definitely
adds
another
layer
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
thing
was
well
worth
the
exuberant
price
a
bit
too
big
for
the
container
lets
just
say
i
can
see
cellulite
hanging
out
the
hotpants
of
this
beer
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
very
good
but
the
bourbon
smell
was
a
little
too
strong
500
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
2009
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
colalike
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
caramel
toffee
bourbon
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
nuts
molasses
and
a
bit
of
brandy
theres
also
a
long
lasting
sweet
malty
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
syrupy
and
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
its
pricey
23
99
a
bottle
but
definitely
worth
trying
absolutely
gorgeous
beer
and
head
and
shoulders
above
the
regular
edition
this
has
mellowed
added
complexity
and
integration
in
equal
measures
it
leaves
it
smooth
supple
and
seductive
this
is
one
sexy
fucking
beer
skål
poured

what
so
ever
nose

great
filled

and
a
little

taste
is
sweet

warming

bourbon
character
is
not
intense
whatsoever
but
the
presence
adds
a
great
edge
caramel
lingers
mouthfeel
is
great
not
very
carbonated
so
it
lets
the
flavors
settle
out
and
shine
but
residual
bubbles
make
it
dangerously
drinkable
cost
24
99
for
a
500
ml
bottle
mo
very
crisp
carbonation
couples
well
with
the
rich
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
this
beer
is
very
bold
and
flavorful
which
is
what
was
expected
from
something
like
this
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
a
nice
indulgence
i
let
this
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
first
poured
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
quicly
disappeared
and
no

color
is
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
brown
with
lots
of
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
bourbon

molasses
flavor
is
like
nose
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
little
bitterness
and
carbonic
tang
to
balance
body
is
good
carbonation
is
fine
although
light
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
average
length
with
a
little
booziness
good
stuff
however
i
expected
a
little
more
fuller
body
slightly
lower
carbonation
no
its
not
flat
coating
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
its
pretty
rare
that
when
i
smell
and
taste
a
beer
it
leaves
me
going
whoaaa
the
price
point
for
this
is
still
atrocious
but
i
cant
deny
this
is
one
of
the
better
old
ales
ive
ever
had
overall
well
the
aroma
got
a
5
and
the
taste
got
a
5
if
the
mouthfeel
got
anything
higher
than
a
3
5
i
think
that
solidifies
this
overall
score
as
a
5
i
really
cant
see
any
way
this
beer
could
be
improved
sure
i
didnt
give
it
5s
across
the
board
but
i
dont
think
i
ever
will
give
that
to
any
beer
point
here
is
that
this
beer
smelled
and
tasted
amazing
and
the
mouthfeel
was
wonderfully
complementary
to
the
beer
seriously
5
0
worthy
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
to
some
extent
reminds
me
a
good
deal
of
firestone
walker
15th
anniversary
which
is
another
beer
i
loved
bottom
line
the
price
tag
on
this
beer
was
high
but
im
so
glad
i
took
a
chance
and
got
it
it
was
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
im
kicking
myself
for
not
buying
more
when
there
were
more
on
the
shelf
an
even
better
version
of
the
already
outstanding
original
old
stock
cellar
reserve
has
all
the
flavours
and
complexity
of
bourbon
but
with
the
drinkability
and
thick
malty
body
of
beer
it
is
for
my
money
25
dollars
one
of
the
best
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
ive
ever
tried
hands
down
you
get
what
you
pay
for
this
has
definitely
been
an
outoftheordinary
experience
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
people
say
it
is
a
wonderful
testimony
to
the
american
craft
beer
revolution
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
darker
caramel
red
color
with
a
light
coastered
tan
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
rich
bourbon
complex
aroma
that
really
is
pleasing
some
booze
in
the
nose
nice
sweet
start
with
lots
of
caramel
oaky
and
some
booze
alcohol
adds
an
extra
burn
at
the
end
medium
mouthfeel
the
booze
warms
the
the
throat
quite
the
sipper
for
sure
o
fantastic
bourbon
barrel
beer
the
bourbon
doesnt
take
center
stage
yet
lingers
throughout
each
sip
really
wish
this
beer
wasnt
so
expensive
as
i
could
see
myself
buying
quite
a
lot
of
it
otherwise
great
cellar
candidate
and
a
great
beer
for
a
chilly
night
o
ive
tried
lots
of
old
ales
in
my
time
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
this
one
is
expensive
were
sure
but
its
worth
every
penny
in
my
opinion
the
beer
is
a
crimson
brown
ruby
color
with
just
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
simply
fabulous
delectable
bourbon
oak
malt
perfect
blend
of
flavors
this
beer
tastes
amazing
incredibly
smooth
time
has
served
this
old
ale
very
well
the
20
price
tag
is
a
bit
steep
but
wow
this
beer
delivers
alcohol
presence
is
completely
unobtrusive
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
a
must
try
o
as
good
or
better
than
any
other
barrel
aged
old
ale
but
at
twice
the
price
this
beer
is
certainly
a
delicacy
and
provides
the
satisfaction
youd
expect
if
you
saved
it
for
a
special
moment
although
its
a
pricey
beer
it
is
a
damn
fine
beer
world
class
o
too
expensive
but
amazingly
good
and
i
think
probably
will
get
better
over
the
next
few
years
at
25
it
lived
up
to
its
price
overall
this
is
a
great
very
complex
beer
that
is
worth
spending
an
evening
sipping
on
however
that
the
price
it
is
this
one
is
strictly
for
special
occasions
o
this
beer
is
really
tasty
strong
complex
beer
its
a
sipper
and
one
that
needsshould
be
shared
with
others
really
enjoyable
would
love
to
try
this
again
sometime
in
the
future
poured
a
dark
reddishmahogany
big
bubbles
are
formed
and
compromise
a
transient
offwhite

that
fades
to
a
thin
collar
no

or
real
retention
to
speak
of

is
caramel
gentle
bourbon
notes
butterscotch
and
hints
of
dark
fruits
in
the
periphery
some
alcohol
notes
too
a
general
sweetness
is
found
throughout
the
nose
taste
is
rich
in
caramel
butterscotch
vanilla
and
bourbon
although
the
bourbon
presents
itself
in
a
harsher
way
than
found
in
the
nose
more
alcohol
and
leather
notes
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
rich
and
relatively
sweet
mediumlow
carb
but
on
second
pours
this
appears
to
be
much
lower
than
i
initially
gathered
great
drinkability
a
true
sipper
decadent
and
something
to
really
be
savoured
this
was
everything
i
was
hoping
that
utopias
would
be
only
a
lot
more
drinkable
and
a
heck
of
a
lot
cheaper
its
got
a
decent
nose
on
it
similar
to
the
utopias
only
with
less
soy
sauce
and
far
less
alcohol
but
its
far
more
drinkable
a
truly
fantastic
brew
and
well
worth
the
25
price
it
commands
it
pours
a
nice
mahogany
in
color
between
light
and
medium
in
body
with
a
slight
beige
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
are
of
candied
sugar
caramel
brown
sugar
vanilla
bourbon
and
oak
if
you
let
it
decant
and
swirl
it
about
a
bit
you
get
some
really
elegant
brandy
notes
even
some
apple
brandy
it
smells
great
it
tastes
of
vanilla
cream
brown
sugar
oak
cherries
port
brandy
bourbon
and
has
a
superb
smooth
creamy
finish
it
is
as
if
all
of
my
tastebuds
stood
up
to
applaud
it
instantly
makes
your
mouth
salivate
it
drinks
so
smoothly
and
definitely
makes
you
pay
attention
this
is
a
superb
old
ale
and
a
phenomenal
barrel
aged
beer
period
i
knew
this
one
would
be
pretty
stellar
but
it
still
surprised
me
what
a
phenomenal
beer
phenomenal
o
great
brew
man
i
love
bourbon
barrel
aging
especially
with
13
abv
old
ales
and
englishstyle
barleywines
so
good
i
could
sit
here
swirling
it
and
smelling
it
all
day
only
negative
is
the
price
point
i
passed
on
picking
up
this
brew
for
a
long
time
just
because
its
pretty
cost
prohibitive
but
i
finally
got
one
for
my
birthday
and
would
have
to
say
that
it
earns
a
definite
recommendation
to
try
it
at
least
once
this
works
i
hate
old
ales
and
yet
this
is
amazing
i
actually
want
to
drink
these
bottles
i
have
the
barrel
aging
really
helps
cut
though
that
stale
pretzel
vibe
that
old
ales
seem
to
have
in
my
past
experiences
d
a
sipper
and
not
meant
to
be
a
session
for
sure
edit
forgot
to
mention
that
one
impressive
factor
of
this
beer
is
that
it
truly
is
a
different
animal
from
the
original
old
stock
so
theres
that
which
is
nice
overall
its
very
smooth
and
very
sweet
solid
showing
for
this
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
was
a
muddy
dark
brown
with
a
huge
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
nothing
no
head
retention
what
so
ever
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
with
strong
caramel
and
brown
sugar
up
front
definitely
some
bourbon
aroma
from
the
aging
in
oak
barrels
the
taste
was
way
over
powering
with
sweetness
a
strong
brown
sugar
taste
takes
over
some
bourbon
and
slight
chocolate
flavor
is
present
as
well
the
body
was
thin
and
lacking
good
carbonation
not
the
best
brew
i
have
had
in
fact
a
little
disappointing
mo
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
thats
a
bit
oily
and
chewy
overall
its
super
drinkable
almost
to
a
fault
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
13
beer
it
goes
down
too
easily
with
no
alcohol
burn
but
with
some
boozy
notes
still
im
definitely
loving
this
one
its
the
2009
reserve
and
was
one
of
three
bottles
left
so
im
happy
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
at
least
once
o
this
is
the
best
old
ale
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
simply
put
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
whatever
the
price
cheers
a
fantastic
treat
on
a
good
night
definitely
not
going
to
pass
this
up
if
i
see
it
again
shared
this
one
with
the
group
at
the
evening
wood
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
cmrillo
also
have
to
give
a
big
thanks
to
womencantsail
for
shipping
this
one
to
after
i
picked
it
up
while
out
in
cali
early
this
year
for
the
bruery
reserve
society
party
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
ruby
red
with
a
very
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
caramel
sweet
alcohol
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
sweet
alcohol
and
caramel
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
it
really
was
a
hit
with
most
of
the
people
at
the
tasting
who
got
to
try
it
the
bourbon
barrel
definitely
is
evident
and
blends
really
well
with
the
other
flavors
going
on
in
this
one
this
one
was
quite
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
and
share
this
one
o
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
for
sure
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
but
not
worth
the
beefy
price
tag
well
never
had
the
chance
to
try
either
of
the
original
releases
but
glad
to
try
this
new
bourbon
version
poured
into
a
snifter
nice
mahogany
color
wit
a
silky
tan
head
nose
has
wood
vanilla
bourbon
bready
malts
nuts
caramel
toffee
cherries
and
plums
barrels
really
tansformed
this
beer
into
something
special
thick
creamy
body
simply
superb
worth
the
price
tag
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
moderate
rocky
offwhite
head
that
lasted
with
good
lacing
medium
to
heavy
dark
fruit
bourbon
and
malt
aroma
full
body
with
a
smooth
texture
and
flat
carbonation
full
complex
bourbon
and
toffee
malt
with
a
long
complex
finish
with
a
small
alcohol
bite
of
long
duration
this
is
a
standout
brew
o
really
great
beer
surprsingly
good
actually
wish
it
did
not
cost
so
much
so
i
wouldnt
feel
bad
about
buying
it
and
drinking
it
more
often
this
barley
wine
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
appreciative
notes
of
bourbon
and
sweet
caramel
complimented
by
dark
fruit
peppery
spices
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
backbone
theres
a
rich
oaky
character
from
the
barrel
aging
and
this
wonderfully
complex
beer
is
velvety
smooth
from
start
to
finish
surprisingly
the
considerable
alcohol
content
isnt
too
noticeable
overall
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
amazing
but
the
mouthfeel
really
took
away
from
the
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
given
the
price
i
dont
know
thatd
id
pick
up
another
o
overall
this
is
a
big
ol
old
ale
lots
of
aroma
and
flavor
very
complex
but
not
over
the
top
definitely
packs
a
punch
wish
i
had
gotten
more
of
these
i
bit
the
bullet
and
bought
a
bottle
of
this
beer
i
love
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
as
long
as
the
aging
it
very
pronounced
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
on
it
the
head
didnt
leave
behind
much
of
any
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
there
were
strong
aromas
of
bourbon
caramel
molassas
and
some
faint
vanilla
the
taste
was
pretty
good
too
the
bourbon
kicked
in
on
the
tounge
for
a
really
nice
sweet
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
on
the
thin
side
i
thought
my
overall
thoughts
of
this
beer
were
kind
of
on
the
negative
end
i
liked
the
beer
essentially
but
the
price
was
hardest
to
swallow
the
beer
should
have
been
much
thicker
i
think
which
would
have
given
it
a
much
better
mouthfeel
i
dont
see
myself
ever
buyng
this
one
again
if
you
knock
off
about
15
off
the
price
tag
it
might
be
worth
it
there
are
better
options
out
there
but
if
you
have
deep
pockets
give
this
one
a
try
thank
you
so
much
matt
o
great
experience
might
be
worth
the
price
it
had
in
stores
old
stock
cellar
reserve
is
an
exceptional
sipper
it
would
pair
extremely
well
with
an
afterdinner
cigar
it
is
heavy
with
alcohol
and
loaded
with
complex
flavor
although
leaving
no
real
feel
it
does
leave
a
great
alcohol
warmth
be
sure
to
share
the
bottle
and
do
not
drink
it
alone
in
the
heat
as
i
did
it
was
very
nice
however
it
packed
an
alcoholrelated
whallop
a
good
brew
for
sure
but
something
has
me
thinking
i
should
have
waited
til
2012
to
open
this
up
o
this
beer
needs
some
aging
on
it
the
abv
is
high
and
it
shows
in
the
flavor
which
i
didnt
care
for
hard
alcohol
like
tones
to
this
beer
should
die
down
with
some
more
time
to
it
as
of
now
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
above
average
but
not
by
much
o
good
stuff
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
its
a
solid
four
but
it
you
could
score
a
half
liter
bottle
for
a
better
price
it
would
be
more
appropriate
45
o
for
25
a
bottle
this
better
be
amazing
and
it
is
worth
trying
once
and
buying
another
to
age
thanks
again
to
dave
for
this
dark
brown
color
some
white
bubble
pop
up
but
are
short
lived
plenty
of
malty
goodness
in
the
nose
big
wafts
of
bourbon
light
chocolate
and
toffee
yep
flavor
is
right
on
with
the
nose
chocolate
molasses
loads
of
caramel
bourbon
oak
and
a
good
bit
of
booze
but
its
not
overdone
damn
this
stuff
is
delicious
mediumfull
body
carbonation
is
actually
higher
than
i
expected
for
the
style
but
i
dig
that
i
could
easily
sip
on
a
couple
bottles
of
this
all
night
long
despite
the
strength
fantastic
o
not
as
good
as
the
brandy
for
me
but
this
was
a
delightful
effort
i
wonder
what
it
tastes
like
fresh
d
13
16
that
is
alot
and
it
is
noted
in
the
taste
while
the
abv
is
high
this
is
very
drinkable
although
it
needs
to
be
sipped
and
one
is
plenty
although
i
kind
of
want
to
crack
another
one
right
now
insanely
expensive
kind
of
a
rip
off
o
this
is
tasty
and
well
done
but
nothing
all
that
spectacular
ill
try
it
on
draft
again
if
i
see
it
but
this
bottle
is
far
to
pricey
for
another
run
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
old
stock
definately
carries
a
masculine
bourbon
caramel
vanill
chocolate
character
that
is
very
shy
in
the
original
version
somewhat
of
a
caramel
and
chocolatey
port
or
brandy
this
is
definately
a
beer
for
discriminating
palates
d
this
was
simply
a
delicious
beer
that
was
clearly
intended
to
age
for
a
long
time
the
alcohol
was
very
noticeable
the
flavors
were
all
super
bold
perhaps
a
bit
rough
still
and
it
seemed
intentionally
overcarbonated
in
510
years
the
alcohol
will
have
mellowed
the
flavors
will
have
softened
and
the
carbonation
will
have
settled
at
that
point
this
will
be
a
top
beer
fresh
its
very
enjoyable
but
not
worth
the
cost
ill
be
sitting
on
my
extra
bottles
for
quite
a
while
o
lovely
beer
with
a
lot
of
subtleties
and
complexity
despite
the
very
strong
bourbon
flavors
and
13
abv
seems
like
itll
only
improve
over
time
the
flavors
of
the
above
mentioned
are
superb
but
the
carbonation
level
kind
of
gets
to
me
it
should
be
mentioned
that
for
the
first
half
hour
out
of
the
bottle
its
rather
harshly
carbonated
but
it
eases
off
a
little
bit
after
sitting
for
a
while
and
you
start
to
get
a
little
bit
of
creaminess
out
of
it
aside
from
this
aspect
this
brew
has
potential
to
become
great
with
a
few
years
in
the
bottle
to
mellow
just
a
bit
into
the
cellar
my
other
bottle
goes
my
major
knock
on
this
is
the
mouthfeel
way
way
overcarbonated
in
my
opinion
totally
effervescent
almost
like
a
soda
it
gives
it
a
sensation
of
being
way
too
light
and
thin
thats
not
what
i
want
from
a
13
abv
barrel
aged
beer
its
odd
though
because
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
overcarbonated
the
first
time
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
o
very
nice
treat
this
is
a
special
beer
very
nice
unique
flavor
profile
for
the
style
its
easy
to
sip
and
im
sure
itll
develop
and
mellow
out
even
more
over
time
its
quite
pricey
dont
take
this
the
wrong
way
just
the
literal
way
this
beer
is
very
light
and
airy
but
finishes
with
medium
to
strong
bourbon
tones
and
highlighted
by
vanilla
notes
and
finishes
with
an
effervescent
bite
almost
like
a
bourbon
flavored
soda
like
i
said
dont
take
it
the
wrong
way
upon
finish
you
cant
help
but
imagine
how
incredible
this
beer
will
be
in
2
3
even
4
years
down
the
road
a
must
have
d
im
certainly
glad
to
have
tried
and
shared
this
one
as
i
enjoy
barrel
aged
beers
but
something
about
this
one
didnt
work
for
me
and
the
old
ale
style
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
its
pretty
boozy
and
the
base
beer
feels
emmacerated
by
the
barrel
most
importantly
the
hefty
pricetag
wont
soon
entice
me
into
buying
another
this
one
will
hold
up
for
a
bit
in
the
bottle
if
looking
to
cellar
drink
it
if
you
must
d
a
fantastic
sipping
old
ale
the
bourbon
really
enhances
this
well
without
completely
taking
over
the
beer
if
this
was
cheaper
i
would
be
all
over
lots
more
of
this
for
longtime
aging
i
can
see
this
getting
even
better
in
a
few
years
d
excellent
brew
great
birthday
gift
from
shango42
big
thanks
for
that
nice
easy
sipper
took
about
an
hour
to
drink
this
bad
boy
couldnt
do
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
i
am
sitting
on
another
bottle
and
very
much
so
looking
to
see
how
this
brew
ages
i
recommend
picking
up
one
or
two
and
trying
it
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
and
with
the
reviews
being
so
high
i
had
big
expectations
for
it
it
definitely
lived
up
to
it
though
this
will
only
continue
to
mature
and
get
better
as
some
time
piles
on
to
it
o
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
one
is
worth
the
tall
price
and
im
definitely
planning
on
going
to
get
some
more
a
great
base
beer
handled
beautifully
to
create
one
of
the
most
complex
yet
balanced
bourbon
barrel
aged
ales
ive
ever
had
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
might
age
and
i
feel
like
i
wont
be
able
to
wait
either
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
and
sticky
but
somewhat
lightened
by
the
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
overall
a
tasty
sipper
the
co2
and
alcohol
presence
was
a
bit
much
for
me
but
its
still
a
nice
treat
overall
good
beer
but
fairly
pricey
d
for
the
abv
this
is
remarkably
smooth
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
the
beer
does
not
stick
out
as
something
special
it
is
an
excellent
bourbon
beer
but
that
is
about
all
it
is
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
light
brown
head
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
nose
is
simply
divine
among
the
best
noses
ive
had
in
years
rich
sexy
enticing
vanilla
bourbony
rumlike
notes
just
call
you
in
like
a
siren
song
dark
rum
like
qualities
lead
into
some
smooth
bready
textures
and
flavors
with
some
soft
butterscotch
light
heat
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
finishes
like
a
liquer
wow
flavor
is
much
more
complex
and
oh
so
incredibly
smooth
bourbon
hits
from
the
start
along
with
some
caramel
molasses
and
a
hint
of
burnt
sugar
light
vanilla
there
as
well
bourbon
dominates
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
beyond
smooth
simply
incredible
this
was
a
sipper
for
nothing
other
than
pure
enjoyment
huge
fan
and
i
hope
they
do
this
more
often
also
please
release
the
brandy
version
again
d
regular
old
stock
is
great
but
this
one
shes
a
winner
i
forgot
all
about
her
expensive
tastes
23bottle
as
we
spent
a
nice
half
hour
together
i
hope
she
doesnt
mind
i
have
one
of
her
twins
sitting
in
my
cellar
poured
into
a
westy
chalice
a
very
nice
brownish
color
very
nice
carbonation
huge
pop
nice

fizzyfoamy

with
some
nice
small

very
nice

theres
a

very
well
this
is
one
amazing
brew
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
chris
drinkability
this
was
a
rare
treat
and
worth
the
money
this
beer
was
awesome
poured
a
beautiful
dark
red
color
with
a
little
tan
head
aromas
of
bourbon
raisins
vanilla
alcohol
and
a
little
caramel
medium
to
full
bodied
with
flavors
of
bourbon
vanilla
maple
syrup
dark
fruits
toffee
oak
and
alcohol
an
excellent
beer
but
way
overpriced
overall
this
is
a
truly
outstanding
beer
fairly
cost
prohibitive
at
24
for
the
500ml
bottle
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
special
occasion
brew
this
one
will
not
disappoint
very
nice
beer
d
well
this
beer
certainly
wasnt
cheap
but
it
sounded
good
and
now
that
i
finally
got
around
to
opening
it
i
am
happy
to
say
that
it
lives
up
to
my
hopes
and
dreams
more
or
less
the
aroma
is
quite
complex
and
really
shows
the
benefits
of
the
barrel
aging
this
beer
smells
more
like
strait
up
bourbon
than
it
does
barrel
aged
beer
in
some
cases
that
would
be
a
word
of
warning
such
as
the
beers
that
we
have
all
had
that
just
seem
like
someone
poured
bourbon
in
right
before
it
was
bottled
but
in
this
case
it
works
magnificently
and
manages
to
convey
all
that
is
good
about
bourbon
with
just
a
touch
of
moderating
influence
from
the
complex
character
of
the
underling
beer
the
flavor
is
no
less
excellent
as
the
fruity
notes
play
with
the
whiskey
and
just
a
touch
of
the
intense
sweaty
hop
character
that
i
remember
from
the
unaltered
base
beer
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
of
the
better
uses
of
whiskey
barrels
in
brewing
that
i
have
come
across
375ml
bottle
courtesy
of
dionysus
pours
dark
copper
with
minimal
head
and
a
chunky
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
has
lots
of
bourbon
caramel
and
some
vanilla
deelicious
taste
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
and
i
love
it
there
is
no
alcohol
burb
at
all
its
noticeable
only
as
it
warms
the
throat
and
chest
and
still
its
gentle
full
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
finish
has
just
the
slightest
taste
of
alcohol
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
rich
bourbon
aromas
pours
very
dark
borwn
with
a
quick
dissipitating
head
that
results
in
a
small
topping
of
beige
head
carbonation
is
surprisingly
strong
for
a
2009
justifying
the
difficulty
in
taking
out
this
corkyes
i
used
a
corkscrew
and
i
am
not
a
total
weakling
a
very
special
ale
rich
malt
and
quality
bourbon
with
a
bias
towards
being
sweet
a
nominal
coconut
taste
and
butteriness
in
the
finish
a
sipper
thanks
to
my
southern
trading
partner
oakiness
is
deep
secondary
and
mellows
and
balances
being
a
canadian
i
am
neutral
and
not
gaga
about
bourbon
had
again
5
months
later
and
big
coconut
and
bourbon
smell
buttery
mouthfeel
full
but
also
with
sourness
from
bourbon
and
in
the
no
points
category
i
have
to
note
how
beautiful
the
bottle
is
gorgeous
faux
ceramic
and
lovely
restrained
label
design
going
to
save
this
one
very
drinkable
but
expensive
this
is
really
difficult
to
drink
though
not
ridiculously
so
for
the
abv
if
it
calms
down
after
the
o
not
the
smoothest
bourbon
barrel
beer
ever
by
far
everything
is
just
a
little
thin
a
little
sharp
still
plenty
of
flavor
to
enjoy
here
just
take
your
time
drinkability
and
savor
every
last
drop
i
did
i
cant
rate
anything
sporting
a
13
16
that
has
this
abrasive
a
nose
higher
than
a
4
0
but
the
remainder
of
this
beer
earned
most
every
bit
of
that
4
0
from
the
taste
to
the
mouthfeel
to
the
continuously
and
visible
lively
effervescence
there
are
certainly
a
few
process
issues
with
this
beer
its
a
little
too
bubbly
the
head
retention
isnt
great
and
its
a
little
harsh
and
chemically
after
it
nears
room
temperature
but
you
almost
want
to
forgive
it
for
what
it
showcases
here
a
truly
remarkable
combination
of
flavors
that
pretty
much
proves
why
certain
beers
belong
in
barrels
i
hope
that
north
coast
can
gradually
tweak
this
one
as
they
continue
to
produce
it
to
address
a
few
of
the
other
issues
present
here
to
make
a
fully
wellrounded
beer
if
so
this
ones
a
candidate
for
the
top
100
if
not
much
much
higher
finally
decided
to
open
this
got
one
other
bottle
in
the
cellar
pours
a
very
hazy
orangish
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
looks
like
this
ones
gonna
be
a
sipper
scent
is
lovely
bourbon
with
some
dark
fruits
raisins
plums
dates
and
brown
sugar
there
are
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
as
well
now
the
moment
to
taste
this
expensive
son
of
a
bitch
it
better
not
let
me
down
and
it
doesnt
wow
great
flavor
that
tastes
just
like
it
smells
amazing
complexity
of
blended
dark
fruits
caramel
bourbon
vanilla
brown
sugar
molasses
with
a
hint
of
cherry
delicious
mouthfeel
is
interesting
its
not
super
carbonated
but
something
just
seems
a
little
off
to
me
overall
its
a
fantastic
beer
with
amazing
flavors
wont
have
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
by
myself
especially
since
the
bottle
is
so
small
worth
the
money
though
imo
well
this
is
a
boozebomb
no
doubt
about
it
im
sure
one
could
lay
this
down
in
a
cellar
feel
good
about
removing
it
in
say
2064
after
its
calmed
down
a
bit
im
having
trouble
scoring
this
one
its
really
good
but
its
excellent
lets
stop
there
very
good
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
19
tv
price
tag
id
go
buy
another
medium
to
full
bodied
low
carbonation
and
smooth
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
but
much
less
than
i
thought
there
would
be
for
an
abv
of
13
16
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
it
came
in
a
500
ml
bottle
as
opposed
to
a
bomber
or
750
ml
container
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
opinion
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
it
was
a
little
weird
in
that
the
aroma
was
so
far
off
from
the
flavor
but
i
cant
hold
that
against
it
too
much
the
flavor
if
this
beer
is
really
nice
overall
i
dont
know
it
is
really
great
but
comes
across
the
palate
a
bit
thin
i
am
seriously
splitting
hairs
here
as
i
brew
and
used
to
regularly
make
wood
aged
beers
so
i
respect
the
velvet
that
they
got
in
the
mouthfeel
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
really
incredible
but
to
drink
it
for
over
20
a
bottle
it
is
quite
prohibitive
if
they
could
pull
this
off
cheaper
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
but
as
it
is
i
am
certainly
glad
that
i
tried
it
d
this
was
a
very
expensive
bottle
but
it
is
worth
the
special
occasion
overall
id
say
its
good
while
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sipped
for
sure
it
is
extremely
smooth
the
low
carbonation
makes
the
beer
feel
a
bit
boozier
on
the
palate
which
is
unfortunate
but
by
no
means
a
dealbreaker
it
is
thicker
than
i
imagined
medium
bodied
and
totes
a
pretty
hefty
abv
the
alcohol
heat
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
seem
to
negatively
influence
the
overall
presentation
of
the
beer
although
even
after
splitting
a
bottle
i
am
not
sure
i
could
stomach
much
more
if
you
can
get
passed
the
steep
price
tag
go
for
it
it
wont
dissapoint
drinkability
pretty
damn
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
certainly
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
too
drinkability
good
d
while
i
dont
appreciate
the
26
i
paid
for
this
bottle
this
beer
is
winning
the
first
barrel
aged
beer
that
was
so
reminiscent
of
the
liquor
that
was
previously
in
the
barrel
for
a
bourbon
lover
this
was
absolutely
epic
extremely
enjoyable
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
just
not
paying
the
price
drinkability
has
to
take
a
slight
hit
mainly
for
the
abv
and
price
i
spent
21
99
for
this
bottle
and
although
i
consider
it
money
well
spent
there
are
enough
expensive
brews
out
there
that
i
wouldnt
buy
another
d
very
very
drinkable
considering
its
13
apv
it
is
a
sipper
but
yes
it
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
im
going
to
grab
a
few
more
before
they
disappear
drinkability
i
felt
like
a
king
sipping
this
ale
it
is
so
well
done
and
so
incredible
that
you
forget
how
hard
it
is
d
cant
believe
im
saying
this
but
this
beer
is
worth
its
ridiculous
price
tag
barrelaging
is
very
subtle
hear
and
well
done
so
it
doesnt
crush
the
complexities
present
but
rather
serves
to
enhance
them
worth
picking
up
to
see
how
itll
evolve
and
perhaps
get
better
with
time
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
the
alcohol
heat
compliments
the
flavors
nicely
this
is
insanely
drinkable
for
13
abv
the
weightlessness
of
this
brew
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
despite
the
huge
abv
while
it
is
certainly
that
of
the
sipping
realm
it
goes
down
easily
and
without
any
coarseness
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
will
recommend
to
a
friend
in
fact
i
brought
one
home
for
a
friend
he
has
a
birthday
coming
up
and
this
is
his
gift
well
see
if
he
reads
this
if
he
does
no
biggy
hell
still
be
pleased
because
the
gift
is
not
in
the
surprise
with
this
beer
the
gift
is
in
the
bottle
i
say
its
worth
the
price
tag
o
is
the
price
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
and
id
love
to
have
more
of
it
but
at
the
price
i
doubt
ill
buy
more
than
another
one
or
two
even
at
the
lowest
price
that
ive
seen
of
22
its
hard
to
swallow
then
again
its
probably
the
closest
ill
get
to
the
brandy
version
from
a
few
years
ago
so
i
might
grab
a
few
more
but
it
was
not
up
to
expectations
and
price
though
and
i
will
take
regular
old
stock
anytime
over
this
enjoyed
another
bottle
of
this
the
summer
of
2014
with
my
son
bryan
along
with
firestone
walker
14
founders
kentucky
breakfast
stout
bourban
county
stout
and
this
one
blew
his
mind
now
at
last
to
the
beer
smooth
well
rounded
and
mellow
with
abundant
brown
sugar
and
caramel
notes
but
not
overly
sweet
bourbon
note
is
modest
and
clean
no
boozyness
despite
the
high
alchol
level
and
while
a
sipper
surpisingly
drinkable
heard
the
great
reviews
about
the
brew
while
its
fresh
so
picked
up
another
bottle
as
well
poured
in
to
a
tulip
glass
pores
a
extremely
dark
amber
hue
color
holding
it
to
the
light
the
drink
is
crystal
clear
and
looks
great
head
easily
forms
with
no
help
what
so
ever
i
am
extremely
surprised
that
the
head
formed
great
from
a
high
abv
barrel
aged
beer
lace
was
left
all
over
the
glass
and
looked
great
the
aroma
was
of
a
lightly
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
bourbon
background
the
flavor
is
similar
but
the
brew
is
much
hotter
than
the
smell
the
sweet
malt
is
mixed
excellently
with
the
bourbon
and
neither
over
powers
the
other
which
is
very
interesting
again
for
this
kind
of
brew
i
feel
like
im
going
to
say
that
through
out
this
review
the
brew
warmed
your
belly
like
a
strong
drink
would
so
this
is
a
sipper
by
far
the
amount
of
carbonation
through
the
drink
is
again
surprising
i
highly
recommend
this
drink
fresh
to
anyone
conclusion
pricy
but
very
enjoyable
while
trying
not
to
justify
the
cost
it
is
very
clean
rich
dessert
type
ale
rather
than
a
football
session
chugalug
beer
everyone
should
try
it
this
is
crazy
drinkable
for
a
13
beer
there
is
so
much
complexity
to
this
beer
that
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
on
the
price
tag
of
this
beer
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
drinkability
really
scary
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
just
so
well
hidden
and
integrated
into
this
beer
its
really
like
i
said
an
extremely
unique
beer
that
is
like
none
other
i
have
ever
had
before
really
reminds
me
of
a
fine
port
or
desert
wine
in
alot
of
ways
a
master
piece
of
a
beer
to
me
that
actually
lived
up
to
the
high
price
one
to
search
out
for
sure
a
very
nice
beer
from
north
coast
though
im
not
sure
the
20
plus
price
tag
is
justified
would
have
to
think
twice
before
buying
another
bottle
of
this
d
hands
down
one
of
the
best
bourbon
aged
beers
ive
had
so
well
balanced
and
sickenly
drinkable
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
hard
to
not
just
gulp
it
down

bourbon
comes
through
in
the
warming
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
the
warming
is
a
bit
intense
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
an
impressive
nightcap
for
sure
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
very
very
much
like
cola
with
a
touch
of
bourbon
ive
never
had
the
regualr
old
stock
but
this
has
inspired
me
to
check
it
out
a
tasty
beer
that
i
found
maybe
a
little
boring
pours
a
dark
slightly
hazy
brown
that
barely
allows
light
through
it
decent
sized
tan
head
disapaits
quickly
leaving
a
tiny
tan
ring
around
the
glass
smells
like
bourbon
heaven
including
nice
vanilla
and
oak
mixed
with
some
dark
fruits
barrel
aging
has
done
something
very
nice
to
the
nose
of
this
beer
creamy
vanilla
and
oak
bring
this
already
excellent
old
ale
to
life
the
booze
is
well
hidden
popping
up
only
a
touch
in
the
finish
and
in
the
warmth
as
it
goes
down
otherwise
the
characteristic
flavors
of
dark
fruits
rum
raisins
and
maybe
even
a
touch
of
leather
appear
underneath
the
star
of
the
show
bourbon
not
the
most
balanced
barrel
aging
such
that
if
you
arenot
a
fan
of
bourbon
you
are
unlikely
to
like
this
beer
regardless
the
old
ale
seems
to
be
a
pretty
good
palate
to
cover
in
bourbon
here
the
mouthfeel
has
big
carbonation
though
not
over
the
top
and
a
small
amount
of
creaminess
is
nice
not
overly
thick
or
sweet
hard
to
talk
about
the
drinkability
of
a
14
bourbon
bomb
but
it
is
pretty
smooth
for
the
aforementioned
characteristics
and
is
not
overly
boozy
altogether
very
tasty
d
yes
the
abv
is
high
but
its
totally
drinkable
this
one
is
going
to
hurt
your
wallet
i
picked
it
up
for
23
95
but
it
is
something
that
has
wowed
me
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
worth
seeking
out
tremendous
beer
very
impressed
with
the
product
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
masked
for
a
beer
that
should
be
a
sipper
it
can
be
difficult
not
to
sip
rather
quickly
the
price
may
deter
some
but
those
who
bite
the
bullet
will
be
rewarded
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
d
this
is
the
most
enjoyable
beer
i
have
had
since
canadian
breakfast
stout
has
graced
my
lips
it
is
delicious
through
and
through
and
is
truly
unique
in
its
flavor
profile
as
a
frequent
consumer
of
bourbon
i
was
a
touch
disappointed
that
there
wasnt
a
more
overt
bourbon
presence
but
what
is
there
is
absolutely
divine
regarding
the
first
question
everyone
asks
when
they
pick
up
this
bottle
is
it
really
worth
the
money
i
can
say
with
the
utmost
confidence
its
a
bargain
this
beer
has
flavor
and
balance
that
rivals
any
40
bottle
of
port
aw
screw
it
ill
buy
another
bottle
or
two
probably
fyou
north
coast
overall
i
have
had
one
outstanding
bottle
one
bad
bottle
that
was
a
drainpour
and
one
bottle
in
the
middle
lots
of
potential
but
a
bit
of
a
gamble
d
one
to
sip
and
savor
the
barrel
and
bourbon
that
the
base
beer
is
exposed
to
is
very
well
done
im
not
sure
i
can
justify
the
price
but
this
was
definitely
a
nice
treat
to
have
check
this
one
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
barrel
aged
beers
who
isnt
or
old
ales
dat
28
a
bottle
not
too
high
its
a
really
nice
beer
but
i
wouldnt
have
identified
it
as
old
stock
in
a
blind
taste
test
in
my
humble
opinion
this
was
overoaked
my
expectations
were
high
and
i
was
slightly
let
down
that
being
said
this
stuff
is
delicious
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
old
ale
very
bruery0like
good
bals
i
like
the
bourbon
flavors
a
lot
solid
i
definitely
dark
lorded
this
bottle
overall
a
very
tasty
drink
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
and
i
am
optimistic
the
aroma
is
rich
and
strong
with
bourbon
alcohol
oak
butterscotch
toasted
malt
and
brown
sugar
the
appearance
is
brown
with
a
fizzy
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
love
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
very
similar
to
the
qualities
you
would
find
in
a
lost
abbey
brew
a
try
it
beer
cheers
d
good
sweet
after
dinner
drink
smooth
liquor
taste
this
makes
a
great
sipping
beer
i
would
replace
my
occasional
port
after
dinner
drinks
with
this
beer
every
once
in
a
while
d
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
the
complexity
makes
you
wish
you
had
more
to
try
but
one
375
ml
bottle
is
more
then
enough
for
one
sitting
this
was
a
serious
sipper
a
lot
going
on
and
not
something
to
pound
glad
for
the
chance
although
ultimately
i
dont
think
its
worth
quite
26
for
the
small
bottle
maybe
1415
is
more
reasonable
based
on
drinkers
enjoyment
not
actual
brewery
cost
issues
though
overall
a
very
solid
sipping
beer
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
but
that
makes
this
a
nice
treat
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
the
base
beer
comes
through
more
than
i
expected
so
thats
a
good
thing
overall
the
bourbon
brightens
up
the
forward
and
midpalate
in
complexity
the
malt
character
from
the
old
stock
is
present
and
very
nice
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
for
the
style
but
overall
it
a
great
beer
i
wish
it
wasnt
20
a
bottle
old
stock
cellar
reserve
pours
transparent
rubygarnet
red
with
deep
brown
edges
and
a
half
finger
loose
tan
head
head
fades
but
its
to
be
expected
from
such
a
beer
aroma
is
sweet
hot
and
full
of
vanilla
oak
cherrys
and
candy
the
flavor
is
the
same
sweet
hot
and
full
of
vanilla
and
oak
this
beer
is
slightly
cloying
and
finishes
sloshy
nice
and
thick
on
the
palate
the
beer
holds
onto
carbonation
well
for
a
bohemoth
its
hot
period
somehow
this
beer
looses
complexity
from
the
barrel
the
straight
stuff
has
more
depth
but
that
isnt
to
say
this
does
not
taste
amazing
truly
impressed
with
this
one
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
bravo
d
very
delicious
slight
booze
burn
and
high
alcohol
make
it
a
sipper
complex
smooth
and
enjoyable
one
of
my
new
favorites
d
i
thought
this
was
a
great
bourbon
barrel
aged
ale
the
nose
on
this
one
is
fantastic
full
of
bourbon
oak
and
caramel
and
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
would
love
to
try
again
definitely
a
bottle
to
split
with
a
few
friends
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
a
silky
medium
body
that
has
a
complex
flavor
profile
slight
alcohol
heat
and
subtle
warmth
in
the
finish
as
in
the
aroma
the
barrel
aging
is
prominent
in
the
flavor
lots
of
earthy
oak
vanilla
and
prominent
bourbon
without
being
hot
although
the
bourbon
flavor
is
there
it
doesnt
burn
your
chest
or
overpower
the
other
characteristics
lots
of
earthy
leathery
malt
with
hints
of
toffee
hazelnut
caramel
and
biscuit
sweet
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
notes
mostly
raisin
date
fig
and
plum
as
mentioned
above
there
is
only
slight
heatwarmth
and
the
abv
of
this
beer
is
incredibly
well
masked
at
this
young
of
an
age
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
complete
boozy
bourbon
bomb
instead
it
is
a
complex
flavorful
well
balanced
and
quaffable
barrel
aged
beer
im
really
looking
forward
to
trying
the
brandy
version
and
the
earlier
bourbon
vintage
oin
protest
this
may
have
been
worthwhile
for
a
few
less
and
about
250ml
more
i
have
reviewed
the
beer
itself
in
an
unbiased
manner
but
as
a
side
note
to
nc
i
feel
horribly
ripped
off
the
high
price
for
a
small
serving
is
not
worth
the
asking
price
it
almost
seems
as
if
you
are
just
seeing
if
you
can
get
away
with
it
i
will
never
buy
another
balaged
offering
from
nc
if
it
is
pakaged
in
the
save
serving
at
the
same
price
never
the
beer
was
good
but
insulting
at
the
same
time
light
carbonation
light
mouthfeel
but
overall
a
tasty
beer
just
too
much
money
and
not
enough
rare
in
the
flavor
edit
12013
sadly
im
drinking
the
last
bottle
i
stored
away
upped
the
overall
to
a
5
amazing
brew
so
mellow
after
2
years
lots
of
discussion
around
this
guy
being
overpriced
but
i
figure
its
comparable
to
a
great
bottle
of
wine
and
in
comparison
its
actually
cheap
i
think
this
ale
has
aged
well
and
i
would
definitely
put
away
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
holds
up
after
another
year
it
could
have
been
a
booze
bomb
but
luckily
thats
not
the
case
this
is
a
sipping
beer
so
savor
every
drop
gonna
throw
a
couple
in
the
cellar
and
see
what
happens
has
some
potential
and
hopefully
some
of
the
carbonation
mellows
all
in
all
this
was
a
great
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
imagine
this
would
be
phenomenal
with
several
years
of
age
behind
it
grab
a
bottle
if
you
like
big
beers
and
let
it
sit
for
as
long
as
you
can
possibly
hold
it
drinkability
a
bit
too
boozy
to
be
that
drinkable
but
very
good
d
this
version
seems
much
much
less
boozy
than
the
previous
one
even
though
it
was
just
released
i
only
wish
it
wasnt
25
for
a
500ml
bottle
maybe
then
i
would
actually
buy
some
notes
wonderful
beer
always
been
a
huge
fan
of
old
stock
so
naturally
a
little
bourbon
aging
raises
it
to
a
new
level
what
can
i
say
25
is
just
too
much
for
a
500ml
bottle
of
barrel
aged
old
ale
theres
no
way
around
the
fact
that
i
would
be
significantly
more
comfortable
paying
15
for
this
and
regardless
of
the
cost
to
the
brewery
i
really
cant
condone
the
product
and
yet
its
just
so
good
presentation
is
quite
nice
corked
and
caged
brown
painted
glass
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brownish
ruby
amber
into
my
bruery
tulip
the
ruby
amber
is
mainly
only
at
the
outer
edges
and
so
dark
its
almost
black
in
the
middle
a
finger
and
a
half
of
off
white
fizzy
head
that
fairly
quickly
dies
down
to
a
ring
of
foam
aroun
the
edge
of
the
glass
nice
sticky
legs
left
behind
no
lacing
though
the
nose
is
of
maple
syrup
toffee
molasses
vanilla
some
oak
and
even
hints
of
truffles
a
very
sweet
and
decadent
aroma
tastes
is
mostly
the
same
plus
there
are
notes
of
chocolate
and
the
truffle
notes
are
stronger
for
the
most
part
its
maple
syrup
molasses
toffee
and
brown
sugar
then
oak
and
bourbon
notes
hit
leaving
a
lasting
bourbon
laced
truffle
flavor
lingering
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
low
end
of
full
bodied
in
fact
its
surprisingly
light
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
is
quite
high
and
assertive
and
creates
a
fairly
dry
finish
its
somewhat
hot
and
warming
going
down
the
carbonation
is
honestly
a
bit
distracting
i
dont
mind
the
warmth
and
the
alcohol
being
present
its
nice
on
a
cold
night
but
the
carbonation
could
have
been
toned
down
a
bit
for
sure
this
one
is
worthy
of
my
first
review
split
into
3
tulip
glasses
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
with
a
kiss
of
creamy
head
smells
intensly
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
lots
and
lots
of
vanilla
in
the
nose
the
firt
sip
blows
you
away
you
can
really
see
where
the
18
months
in
bourbon
barrels
has
shaped
this
brew
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
tons
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
and
as
it
warms
you
get
a
beautiful
caramel
chewy
very
very
chewy
feels
like
chewing
a
nice
piece
of
caramel
in
fact
slight
alcohol
sting
in
the
back
but
as
it
warms
up
it
becomes
alot
more
enjoyable
i
could
have
easily
finished
the
bottle
by
myself
it
isnt
cheap
at
24
for
375ml
but
man
its
worth
opening
up
when
in
the
mood
for
something
special
d
a
nice
treat
and
truly
a
sipper
as
stated
above
it
needs
a
few
years
to
be
totally
awesome
great
brew
and
worth
seeking
thanks
again
brian
why
are
you
so
expensive
old
stock
i
like
you
so
much
i
love
your
vanilla
sweetness
your
soft
touch
of
alcohol
plus
youre
brilliant
with
cinnamon
sugar
pecans
id
buy
so
many
of
you
if
you
didnt
cost
so
damn
much
this
beer
is
absolutely
incredible
it
is
everything
i
could
have
wanted
in
the
style
and
more
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
this
beer
continuously
amazed
me
it
is
so
smooth
and
so
welldone
im
so
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
experience
it
if
i
were
reviewing
this
beer
on
iron
chef
id
say
drinking
it
is
like
falling
into
a
warm
feather
bed
enveloping
me
in
heavenly
sleep
d
drinks
far
too
easy
for
being
as
big
as
it
is
i
have
to
force
myself
to
take
small
sips
and
make
it
last
im
actually
pissed
i
didnt
just
take
this
whole
bottle
from
kelley
light
to
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
this
is
a
lot
thinner
than
fellow
old
ales
the
boozy
nature
of
this
guy
and
the
super
high
abv
make
this
guy
a
sipper
and
while
i
didnt
fully
hate
this
beer
i
was
definitely
underwhelmed
23
for
this
bottle
and
i
felt
as
though
it
was
above
average
notes
you
know
i
really
wanted
this
to
be
my
new
favorite
but
as
with
most
of
my
favorite
beers
when
they
end
up
in
barrels
im
not
always
stoked
i
wonder
if
the
brandy
barrel
was
better
i
think
im
learning
that
i
dont
like
barleywine
style
things
in
bourbon
but
do
enjoy
them
in
brandy
hmmm
d
good
but
there
is
no
way
this
beer
warrants
25
for
the
size
north
coast
needs
to
learn
that
people
will
buy
more
for
less
la
angels
share
is
17
so
why
would
i
drop
an
extra
8
on
this
overpriced
and
rated
this
would
age
quite
gracefully
i
have
purchased
one
bottle
for
my
cellar
i
know
its
extremely
limited
in
portland
but
i
feel
another
bottle
would
be
great
to
be
able
to
taste
it
in
different
aged
stages
overall
an
awesome
beer
worth
the
23
to
try
but
i
am
seriously
trying
to
justify
buying
a
couple
more
to
throw
in
the
cellar
d
what
a
treat
even
though
the
cost
per
oz
was
a
little
hard
to
swallow
that
of
course
wasnt
figured
into
the
drinkability
score
has
to
be
tasted
to
be
believed
verdict
not
worth
the
price
tag
right
now
maybe
after
a
year
of
cellaring
worth
trying
if
you
run
across
it
overall
pretty
drinkable
really
it
was
just
a
sweet
bourbon
beer
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
and
if
you
really
like
bourbon
youll
probably
enjoy
this
beer
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
complex
but
im
hoping
some
time
will
help
develop
it
more
poured
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
that
had
a
thin
frothy
head
and
left
some
good
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
some
very
nice
vanilla
bourbon
aromas
are
pretty
strong
on
the
nose
alongside
mild
oaky
cocoa
and
toffee
notes
you
could
definitely
smell
the
booze
but
its
not
overwhelming
whatsoever
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
also
dominated
the
palate
with
toffee
oaky
and
cocoa
accents
but
had
mild
butterscotch
notes
as
well
there
was
lots
of
bourbon
character
but
it
was
not
hot
at
all
the
booze
was
pretty
well
hidden
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
very
pleseant
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
bourbon
oaky
very
mild
boozy
and
silky
finish
that
lingered
on
the
palate
regardless
of
the
abv
it
drank
better
than
i
thought
and
was
even
more
tastier
than
i
thought
very
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
gem
split
this
with
waltonc
pours
a
rich
golden
brown
with
a
frothy
head
smells
of
bourbon
vanilla
carmel
apple
more
bourbon
cinnamon
and
burnt
brown
sugar
the
taste
follows
the
smell
and
it
reminds
me
of
anchor
our
barrel
ale
as
it
is
overall
a
fairly
light
barrelaged
barleywine
or
old
ale
depending
on
definition
medium
to
lighter
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
actually
could
stand
to
tone
down
the
carbonation
a
bit
but
after
it
sits
in
a
snifter
for
a
while
gets
to
an
ideal
carbonation
on
its
own
this
is
very
drinkable
and
unfortunately
has
a
very
high
price
tag
i
wish
ncbc
would
have
priced
this
more
appropriately
but
they
went
that
route
and
thus
ill
search
out
other
more
affordable
barrelaged
beers
for
enjoyment
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
glad
i
have
another
bottle
i
like
sweet
beers
so
this
one
works
it
is
like
eating
a
piece
of
carmel
with
a
glass
of
bourbon
to
wash
it
down
the
only
downfall
the
25
price
tag
for
500ml
come
on
thanks
to
joeyschlitz
for
generously
opening
this
on
new
years
eve
pours
dark
caramel
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
smells
like
a
bourbon
caramel
apple
taste
is
all
malt
sweet
brown
sugar
caramel
apples
bourbon
and
toffee
very
well
rounded
and
complex
body
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
this
year
dthis
is
pretty
solid
seems
well
balanced
and
not
oxidized
the
bourbon
is
pleasant
and
light
the
malt
body
is
pretty
huge
and
the
base
beer
is
well
integrated
the
heat
is
there
but
not
offensive
the
sweet
raisins
are
nice
to
balanced
the
other
flavors
good
stuff
aroma
is
just
hugely
rich
with
tons
of
barrel
character
rich
slightly
buttery
caramels
toffees
toasty
wood
sweet
syrupy
richness
and
caramelized
flavors
very
slight
oxidization
peeking
through
at
this
point
but
at
no
point
was
it
a
detriment
to
the
beer
vanilla
great
deep
fruity
date
note
drinks
great
for
the
nearly
15
beast
still
mediumfull
mouthfeel
low
carb
great
rich
beer
to
sip
on
j
very
good
beer
im
very
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
i
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
the
brandy
version
at
some
point
tons
of
prune
graham
crackers
which
are
awesome
on
the
aroma
and
taste
a
little
sweet
right
but
in
time
will
be
unreal
bottle
pours
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
thinn
fizzy
head
rich
nose
quite
boozy
with
raisins
pungent
whiskey
a
bit
of
vanilla
flavor
is
quite
different
from
the
brandy
version
more
chocolate
and
vanilla
sweetness
in
the
mouth
hot
and
pleasantly
boozy
as
expected
nice
sweetness
with
a
lot
of
that
vanilla
but
not
an
overly
complex
flavor
a
little
bit
thin
nice
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
an
extraordinary
barrelaged
barleywine
by
any
stretch
d
i
like
this
one
better
then
the
brandy
version
like
i
previously
said
perhaps
the
bourbon
is
ready
to
drink
now
while
the
brandy
has
some
more
age
left
not
sure
but
ill
give
it
another
year
and
ill
crack
them
both
open
again
a
revisit
d
id
probably
buy
a
few
of
the
bourbon
barrel
old
stock
that
is
coming
out
again
however
i
felt
they
had
a
huge
hit
with
the
brandy
barrel
version
and
im
disappointed
that
they
bet
on
the
wrong
horse
for
the
second
iteration
oh
well
d
i
would
drink
another
bottle
this
is
a
really
really
good
beer
the
insane
rarity
aside
this
is
an
amazing
beer
worth
tracking
down
incredibly
complex
and
drinkable
this
was
was
everything
i
had
wanted
it
to
be
and
more
quite
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
hands
down
go
seek
this
one
out
now
it
is
dead
on
perfect
really
excellent
overall
just
as
good
as
the
brandy
version
going
to
have
to
make
the
trip
up
the
next
time
they
release
this
bad
boy
d
very
i
am
honored
to
have
tried
this
one
dakine
d
id
never
guess
that
this
is
almost
15
the
bourbon
barrel
has
imparted
one
wicked
flavor
on
the
ale
well
done
dark
brown
perfectly
clear
has
a
very
pristine
filtered
appearance
pours
with
two
fingers
of
fleeting
tan
head
mellower
than
the
05
but
less
complex
heavy
on
the
oak
and
bourbon
feels
a
bit
refined
but
still
quite
good
this
doesnt
touch
the
2005
brandy
barrel
old
stock
but
its
a
good
beer
all
the
same
probably
more
of
an
a
beer
my
scores
reflect
the
original
2005
bottling
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
low
but
its
a
little
higher
than
the
brandy
version
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
some
viscosity
this
is
an
excellent
beer
though
very
hot
drinkability
the
abv
will
hold
it
back
some
but
really
for
a
beer
this
strong
im
very
impressed
with
how
easy
it
goes
down
north
coast
what
can
i
say
other
than
i
love
this
brew
and
to
tayner
thanks
so
much
for
the
opportunity
if
theres
a
brew
youd
like
to
try
send
me
a
bm
and
ill
do
my
best
to
find
it
for
you
sweet
and
strong
yet
balanced
very
well
with
its
medium
chewy
body
and
the
pleasant
warming
finish
i
could
drink
this
stuff
day
in
and
day
out
but
its
potency
and
availability
would
never
let
this
happen
awesome
brew
this
is
a
great
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
a
very
small
notch
below
the
brandy
barrel
but
thats
pretty
good
company
big
thanks
to
damian
for
sharing
this
rarity
old
stock
ale
cellar
reserve
bourbon
barrel
is
great
beer
though
i
much
prefer
bourbon
whiskey
to
brandy
im
sure
that
old
stock
cellar
reserve
brandy
barrel
is
outstanding
as
well
the
neck
label
indicates
that
this
offering
is
part
of
the
american
artisan
series
thats
north
coast
brewing
in
a
nutshell
american
artisans
dark
bronze
colored
beer
very
nice
aroma
showcases
notes
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
caramel
maple
and
sweet
bourbon
flavor
is
very
complex
but
still
a
touch
hot
and
slightly
too
bourbon
accented
still
has
some
serious
malt
depth
to
it
with
notes
of
melted
caramel
chocolate
cocoa
and
toffee
very
nice
natural
carbonation
these
ba
old
stocks
are
beauties
thankfully
it
smells
and
tastes
a
lot
better
than
it
looks
the
bourbon
is
very
well
integrated
frankly
it
puts
some
other
offerings
ive
had
recently
to
shame
vanilla
wood
and
the
earthy
bourbonity
are
in
the
head
and
the
flavor
right
from
the
getgo
sweet
malt
and
a
dark
fruit
background
make
for
a
truly
great
beer
though
its
definitely
a
sipper
pours
a
rich
brownish
color
with
a
haze
smell
is
sweet
fruity
and
smooth
bourbon
with
vanilla
and
hints
of
oak
nice
complex
delicious
smell
taste
is
oaky
and
bourbony
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
not
overly
strong
flavored
with
sweet
malt
and
really
tasty
warming
alcohol
but
not
obtrusive
in
the
least
for
me
this
stuff
is
awesome
this
beer
was
phenomenal
and
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
standard
old
stock
from
past
years
was
not
that
great
the
first
few
times
i
had
it
but
the
barrel
aged
version
is
a
whole
different
story
i
usually
prefer
brandy
barreled
stuff
more
and
i
cannot
wait
to
open
that
bottle
in
a
few
weeks
would
drink
again
in
a
second
highly
recommended
this
beer
has
an
array
of
wellintegrated
flavors
but
it
didnt
seem
to
match
the
complexity
and
magic
that
i
found
in
the
brandy
barrel
version
still
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
north
coast
pours
a
fairly
murky
brown
in
color
with
amber
hues
an
average
size
light
tan
head
fades
quickly
fairly
still
after
that
even
when
agitated
in
the
glass
outstanding
aroma
of
rich
aged
maltiness
prunes
and
raisins
mix
with
a
bourbony
alcohol
warmth
great
leather
qualities
in
the
nose
when
agitated
along
with
some
dry
woodiness
taste
is
a
nice
soft
sugary
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
up
front
with
a
decent
amount
of
sweet
vanilla
before
a
decently
dry
and
woody
finish
that
shows
its
alcohol
strength
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
a
little
sweet
stickiness
on
the
lips
and
a
slight
bite
on
the
tongue
followed
by
the
warmth
of
alcohol
great
beer
outstanding
aroma
alcohol
shows
itself
but
in
the
right
proportion
pretty
balanced
for
14
6
i
could
spend
a
fortune
on
this
if
this
were
available
on
a
regular
basis
i
love
the
bottle
i
loved
this
beer
time
has
served
this
quite
well
and
while
i
was
apprehensive
reading
this
as
14
6
abv
i
am
quite
happy
to
note
it
drinks
much
lighter
full
body
low
carbonation
very
warming
very
complex
and
enjoyable
a
sipper
for
sure
i
think
that
i
liked
the
brandy
version
a
bit
more
this
one
seems
a
bit
hotter
i
find
that
this
one
needs
more
time
in
the
bottle
to
meet
the
brandy
barrel
version
however
now
it
is
still
an
amazing
beer
definitely
harder
than
the
brandy
barrel
aged
version
but
not
overly
so
and
i
can
see
this
appealing
more
to
some
people
the
sharper
barrel
notes
which
the
bourbon
brings
out
are
really
nice
though
and
make
this
beer
different
enough
in
a
good
way
from
the
brandy
that
i
find
that
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
far
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
really
think
that
trying
this
beer
after
i
sampled
the
brandy
one
separated
by
days
has
made
me
enjoy
this
beer
all
that
much
more
if
i
had
had
it
at
the
same
time
or
before
the
other
one
i
dont
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
as
much
the
differences
that
my
memory
has
played
out
seem
to
be
the
most
intriguing
part
of
this
beer
what
this
relies
on
though
is
the
fact
that
this
beer
while
clearly
barrel
dominated
does
not
allow
the
barrel
notes
to
overwhelm
marginalize
the
base
beer
in
the
end
it
is
a
little
too
alcohol
accented
in
the
flavor
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
the
brandy
barrel
aged
old
stock
but
it
is
still
damn
tasty
and
quite
close
drinkability
is
great
this
is
obviously
a
sturdy
beer
clocking
in
at
14
abv
but
it
is
so
tasty
and
interesting
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
sip
and
actually
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
that
has
such
a
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
hidden
rather
well
drinkability
a
great
beer
and
a
fine
offspring
of
the
old
stock
ale
but
i
gotta
say
the
brandy
barrel
version
just
barely
beats
it
out
i
have
come
to
really
appreciate
and
love
old
stock
ale
this
edition
aged
in
bourbon
bottles
is
two
years
old
and
superb
deep
copper
color
is
a
bit
cloudy
no
head
and
or
lacing
is
present
but
it
looks
darn
good
deep
luscious
aroma
of
stewed
dark
fruits
and
of
course
bourbon
invites
extremely
smooth
with
dark
fruit
tones
mainly
raisin
and
plum
bourbon
notes
are
in
prominent
evidence
and
lend
lots
of
character
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
despite
this
beers
great
strength
the
ultimate
sipper
for
a
winters
night
outstanding
beer
this
brew
challenges
you
to
take
the
smallest
sips
possible
because
theres
so
much
flavor
there
ive
been
working
on
it
for
over
half
an
hour
and
im
not
half
finished
great
old
ale
that
will
be
better
when
its
older
they
took
an
already
great
bear
and
turned
it
into
an
absolutely
amazing
one
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
great
sipper
at
that
this
lived
up
to
my
expectations
it
was
excellent
almost
the
perfect
old
ale
looks
like
it
should
ruby
with
some
haze
smells
great
caramel
vanilla
sweet
taste
is
much
the
same
with
backend
booziness
just
ever
so
slightly
undercarbed
in
my
opinion
but
cant
complain
great
beer
o
this
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
sublime
never
had
a
beer
like
this
tastes
like
a
slightly
carbonated
tawny
port
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
cellar
the
2011
brew
is
truly
beautiful
o
a
middle
of
the
road
bourbon
barreled
ale
about
what
you
would
expect
for
their
base
beer
after
some
time
in
a
bourbon
barrel
a
little
pricey
for
a
500ml
bottle
i
find
north
coasts
old
stock
ale
to
be
really
raw
and
boozy
but
this
brandy
barrelaged
version
transformed
the
base
beer
into
something
magical
i
look
forward
the
next
release
of
this
whenever
that
may
be
5
oz
pour
from
500ml
bottle
into
russian
river
tulip
on
1feb15
overall
its
a
world
class
beer
there
are
few
if
any
better
examples
of
an
old
ale
let
alone
one
aged
in
brandy
barrels
the
brandy
character
is
incredibly
unique
which
makes
this
beer
truly
one
of
a
kind
if
you
see
it
get
it
immediately
if
you
have
one
drink
it
if
you
have
two
let
the
other
one
sit
for
1
to
3
years
for
this
beer
to
reach
its
potential
as
a
never
before
seen
animal
overall
this
is
a
top
of
the
line
old
ale
o
wow
this
one
is
special
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
would
buy
again
in
a
heartbeat
what
a
treat
500ml
pour
into
new
belgium
globe
glass
pours
a
dark
cherry
very
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
boozy
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
some
vanilla
and
caramel
the
first
sip
is
full
of
brandy
flavor
that
leads
to
a
mild
caramel
taste
due
to
the
strong
boozy
taste
after
the
first
sip
i
was
unsure
if
i
was
up
to
drinking
the
whole
bottle
but
after
a
few
sips
the
drinkability
improves
overall
a
fantastic
beer
i
found
it
at
a
bottle
shop
in
rural
new
jersey
and
am
very
glad
with
the
purchase
a
very
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
certainly
try
again
so
we
had
the
chance
to
purchase
a
16
bbl
at
the
restaurant
i
work
at
for
a
reasonable
price
of
439
for
16bbl
to
keep
our
cost
under
30
we
would
have
had
to
charge
25
for
a
10oz
pour
hell
even
dogfish
120
or
wws
is
less
than
200
for
a
16
barrel
overall
a
sweet
and
boozy
beer
pretty
good
too
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
so
much
depth
and
complexity
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
coats
the
mouth
very
well
it
is
much
better
than
many
ba
stouts
that
i
have
had
i
hope
to
get
this
one
again
tough
to
beat
this
as
a
sipper
on
a
cold
rainy
day
o
while
barrel
aging
has
been
all
the
rage
in
the
craft
beer
segment
for
years
finding
a
brandy
barrel
aged
beer
is
still
very
much
a
rarity
its
a
welcome
change
of
pace
from
the
ubiquitous
bourbon
barrel
aging
in
this
case
the
brandy
flavors
are
the
focal
point
of
a
beer
whose
base
flavor
profile
complements
them
most
graciously
the
sweet
sticky
malty
and
vinous
flavors
of
the
old
ale
are
a
perfect
springboard
for
a
dominant
brandy
barrel
character
this
is
a
gratifying
and
complex
sipper
that
offers
a
very
unique
experience
it
has
an
upperclass
air
about
it
i
actually
prefer
it
to
bourbon
barrel
aged
old
stock
worth
the
high
price
tag
drink
i
was
surprised
i
didnt
have
to
trade
for
this
one
was
great
to
finally
find
a
top
250
just
sitting
on
the
shelves
would
love
another
bottle
to
hold
onto
for
a
couple
years
was
a
layered
and
pretty
complex
drinking
ba
beer
2011
vintage
first
time
having
this
and
i
am
so
pleased
to
have
come
across
it
deep
brown
color
with
moderate
carbonation
head
dissipates
completely
in
approximately
60
seconds
dark
fruits
sugary
sweetness
nectar
of
the
old
ale
gods
the
taste
is
so
balanced
with
the
brandy
influence
definitely
there
but
refined
and
subtle
absolutely
perfect
drinking
experience
and
i
must
have
this
one
again
o
probably
the
best
beer
of
its
style
that
ive
had
its
similar
to
bois
arctic
devil
and
mother
of
all
storms
but
so
much
smoother
such
a
freaking
good
beer
a
sipper
i
keep
sipping
sipping
wishing
this
came
in
a
750ml
bottle
north
coast
has
certainly
nailed
the
art
of
the
hellaciously
expensive
beer
that
sticks
around
due
to
the
price
tag
but
is
ultimately
worth
it
once
as
a
treat
would
i
buy
another
no
am
i
happy
i
danced
for
one
yeah
excellent
beer
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
am
happy
i
finally
had
it
its
very
complex
and
has
a
lot
going
on
with
it
the
barrel
flavors
are
incredible
i
wish
i
could
have
this
more
often
overall
a
really
great
beer
its
definitely
drinking
hot
right
now
though
still
excellent
this
will
only
improve
with
some
age
overall
extremely
enjoyable
for
experienced
craft
beer
drinkers
loved
it
t
pretty
sweet
upfront
brown
sugar
vanilla
toffee
and
burnt
caramel
the
toffee
is
probably
the
strongest
note
i
get
here
and
it
slowly
fades
into
a
burnt
raisin
skin
note
near
the
middle
the
beer
gets
drier
and
drier
as
it
goes
finally
ending
in
a
slightly
hot
finish
with
big
notes
of
brandy
maple
syrup
and
pronounced
oak
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
in
here
leading
me
to
want
to
assume
this
beer
is
far
less
than
15
a
quick
attempt
to
get
out
of
my
chair
leads
me
to
believe
otherwise
though
ridiculously
well
done
12
for
an
8
ounce
pour
yeah
its
a
swift
kick
in
the
nuts
but
one
that
i
would
probably
ask
for
again
2011
vintage
pours
a
nicely
carbonated
dark
brownish
red
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
scent
is
strong
in
booze
a
ton
of
hot
brandy
and
other
whiskey
aromas
tons
of
dark
fruits
with
a
whole
lot
of
malt
lots
of
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
toffee
more
sweet
brandy
this
beer
smells
spectacular
taste
is
just
as
good
as
the
beer
smells
boozy
brandy
and
oaky
barrel
flavors
up
front
sweet
brandy
and
vanilla
flavors
lots
of
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
prunes
and
dates
wow
this
thing
is
boozy
lingering
maple
syrup
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
doesnt
lose
points
for
this
very
fullbodied
drinkability
is
high
but
a
sipper
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
very
hot
but
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
over
the
years
o
one
big
stinging
fruity
old
ale
sharp
sharp
strong
flavors
and
borderline
overpowering
booziness
i
am
well
accustomed
to
boozy
brews
but
this
one
is
serious
a
true
sipper
500ml
is
almost
too
much
thankfully
its
not
a
750
are
you
listening
the
bruery
seriously
big
and
seriously
good
one
of
the
very
best
old
ales
out
there
i
will
also
note
that
this
significantly
better
than
the
bourbon
barrel
version
in
my
opinion
bottle
from
the
grocery
store
very
excited
to
find
this
one
corked
and
caged
500
ml
2011
year
poured
into
my
fw
teku
glass
on
feb

2014
pours
dark
brown
with
a
slight
red
hue
and
a
one
finger
yellowish
brown
head
big
time
sweet
brandy
aroma
with
lots
of
nuttiness
and
brown
sugar
maybe
a
little
cocoa
very
much
like
a
pralines
smell
big
bold
brandy
flavor
with
plenty
of
nuts
and
brown
sugar
caramel
marshmallow
toffee
wow
this
is
impressive
lots
of
sweet
brown
sugar
but
balanced
by
some
nutty
bitterness
body
is
heavy
and
slightly
boozy
but
lightened
by
a
surprisingly
large
amount
of
carbonation
i
recently
had
bois
bourbon
and
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
that
albeit
with
less
vanilla
flavors
a
very
nice
after
dinner
treat
overall
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
good
this
was
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
bit
more
age
but
already
great
wow
very
good
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
bread
pudding
brandy
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
brown
sugar
toffee
and
brandy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
wood
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
absolutely
phenomenal
brandy
barrel
aged
aromas
and
tasty
flavors
that
unfortunately
dont
match
up
to
the
smell
pours
a
very
dark
amber
highlighted
with
ruby
hues
capped
by
a
one
and
half
finger
beige
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
huge
vanilla
notes
oak
butterscotch
and
booze
on
the
nose
opens
with
vanilla
butterscotch
brown
bread
general
nuttiness
hints
of
toffee
and
leather
as
well
as
dates
and
dark
fruit
midpalate
finishes
with
oak
accents
of
fig
strong
brandy
booziness
and
vanilla
fairly
syrupy
smooth
full
body
very
low
carbonation
wow
brandy
barrels
and
old
stock
ale
are
as
solid
a
combination
as
one
might
expect
absolutely
exceptional
overall
the
barrel
is
very
nice
vanilla
is
one
of
the
best
components
of
the
brandy
barrel
and
it
augments
this
beer
well
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
chestnut
hue
with
a
soft
fluffy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
wonderful
offering
scents
of
toffee
caramel
oak
booze
vanilla
wow
what
flavor
a
delightful
beer
to
sip
brandy
character
comes
in
late
lingering
on
the
palate
between
drinks
although
there
is
certainly
an
alcohol
presence
this
beer
is
silky
smooth
and
elegant
15

and
something
i
could
sip
on
for
hours
wonderfully
complex
delicious
wellbalanced
a
worldclass
beer
yup
this
was
definitely
worth
the
wait
the
beer
is
incredibly
complex
and
it
reveals
a
lot
of
aromas
tastes
and
texture
in
short
order
its
put
together
beautifully
as
all
the
flavors
strike
the
right
place
on
the
mouth
and
at
the
right
time
the
fruitier
and
spicier
taste
from
brandy
barrels
give
the
ale
something
unexpected
and
truly
majestic
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
served
in
a
snifter
is
the
best
way
to
enjoy
this
the
brandy
in
this
is
just
kickin
a
sipper
in
every
sense
of
the
word
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
during
the
cold
months
paired
with
a
fine
cigar
or
as
a
digestif
after
a
gourmet
dinner
absolutely
marvelous
lots
of
sherry
like
aroma
dark
fruits
caramel
brandy
yes
you
can
actually
detect
brandy
its
a
tad
bit
sweet
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
completely
alcohol
is
not
detected
jd
score
4
49
o
letting
this
sit
around
warm
up
to
room
temperature
really
opened
up
a
great
bouquet
of
flavors
the
minimal
oxidation
gave
it
a
sherry
like
flavor
to
it
and
a
nice
sweetness
as
well
most
personal
whales
disappoint
this
did
not
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
mild
level
of
carbonation
that
really
worked
in
this
offering
the
15
abv
is
masterfully
hidden
it
wasnt
until
i
finished
my
glass
and
stood
up
that
the
strength
really
hit
me
for
that
reason
coupled
with
such
a
low
level
of
carbonation
being
very
enjoyable
i
have
to
give
this
a
perfect
feel
rating
this
was
a
solid
experience
that
i
was
very
appreciative
of
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
base
beer
and
this
was
quite
a
treat
big
thanks
to
you
heath
despite
making
my
face
numb
with
this
treat
right
at
the
start
of
a
tasting
this
was
another
treat
from
the
cellar
that
i
was
finally
able
to
get
around
to
and
share
there
was
a
little
oxidation
present
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
it
seemed
to
mostly
mingle
well
with
that
sweet
and
smooth
mix
of
old
ale
and
brand
barrel
and
i
cant
stress
enough
how
damn
drinkable
this
was
for
the
size
i
really
hope
that
they
make
this
again
as
id
probably
even
be
willing
to
pay
the
high
price
that
north
coast
now
charges
for
their
special
release
beers
o
good
beer
not
hot
at
all
dangerously
drinkable
would
like
to
see
them
make
some
more
of
this
d
ive
had
this
a
few
times
over
the
years
and
its
never
blown
me
a
away
i
certainly
dont
think
its
improving
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
falling
off
precipitously
either
north
coast
please
make
a
new
batch
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
a
moderate
improvement
over
regular
old
stock
o
this
is
certainly
holding
up
well
and
i
am
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
rare
bottle
375
ml
bottle
2005
vintage
big
thanks
to
mark
for
opening
this
one
up
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
a
few
big
bubbles
can
be
seen
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
brandy
with
notes
of
plum
raisin
and
vanilla
hints
of
coconut
and
oak
as
well
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
but
nothing
overwhelming
the
taste
is
sweet
with
brandy
and
grape
followed
up
by
some
vanilla
coconut
oak
caramel
and
some
raisin
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
as
well
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
on
the
finish
as
expected
for
a
nearly
15
abv
medium
body
very
low
carbonation
but
it
certainly
works
well
for
this
beer
overall
an
amazing
beer
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
went
down
really
easy
candy
booze
i
had
to
restrain
myself
just
downing
it
really
well
aged
and
delcious
wish
i
had
a
bottle
of
my
own
or
they
made
more
a
must
try
ddecent
and
reasonably
balanced
it
is
very
sweet
and
might
be
slightly
oxidized
solid
flavors
that
blend
together
love
the
raisins
decent
stuff
and
goes
down
smooth
with
the
huge
body

j
thanks
to
seani
think
for
this
one
drank
and
compared
side
by
side
with
the
bourbon
version
the
bourbon
was
clearly
superior
to
me
and
i
believe
that
was
the
consensus
among
the
group
as
well
the
aroma
on
the
bourbon
is
awesome
dominates
the
brandy
vanilla
wood
dark
brown
sugar
the
brandy
is
harsher
more
bitter
acohol
the
taste
is
alcoholic
brandy
just
doesnt
work
that
well
a
little
caramel
and
chocolate
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
small
ring
of
bubbles
that
are
not
as
fine
as
i
expected
big
big
nose
on
this
one
good
amount
of
leather
and
leafy
tobacco
sweet
brandy
nice
charred
oak
raisins
sharper
carbonation
on
the
tongue
than
i
had
expected
very
rich
focused
on
that
old
tobacco
leather
kind
of
a
nice
sweet
brandy
delicious
mouthfeel
is
strange
its
quite
thick
and
almost
syrupy
but
has
really
pringly
carbonation
seems
like
around
the
edges
one
of
the
better
barrelaged
barleywines
ive
had
for
sure
d
very
good
but
didnt
blow
me
away
this
one
was
outshined
by
several
other
beers
we
had
during
the
night
i
think
some
more
cellar
time
would
do
this
one
good
while
the
bourbon
version
seems
ready
to
drink
now
d
the
girlfriend
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
so
i
wound
up
enjoying
most
of
her
pour
too
i
had
no
trouble
putting
down
a
lot
of
it
though
obviously
its
big
beer
and
not
something
i
should
be
drinking
a
lot
of
if
it
came
out
again
id
get
it
no
questions
hopefully
they
wont
charge
20
a
pint
or
whatever
they
were
asking
for
old
rasputin
xii
this
one
is
most
definitely
a
sipper
that
shows
every
bit
of
its
high
abv
the
flavor
profile
and
complexity
present
here
are
outstanding
i
wish
i
had
some
notes
to
compare
this
to
a
fresh
bottle
but
this
is
the
only
time
ive
tried
it
i
cant
see
why
this
one
wouldnt
continue
to
mellow
and
improve
for
years
to
come
the
feel
is
thick
but
smooth
the
warm
finish
and
nice
toffee
sweetness
are
truly
an
accomplishment
for
a
beer
this
big
the
balance
is
absolutely
insane
and
i
really
would
like
to
have
another
shot
at
this
one
overall
this
is
one
amazing
beer
and
definitely
the
best
old
ale
ive
ever
had
and
the
barrel
aging
of
this
beer
was
done
perfectly

d
absolutely
incredible
big
thanks
again
to
mcallister
for
getting
this
one
out
to
me
fairly
low
alcohol
on
an
extremely
complex
beer
this
has
aged
wonderfully
and
i
would
be
very
happy
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
absolutely
fing
tremendous
unbelievable
butterscotch
toasted
pecan
and
toffee
vanilla
super
sweet
caramel
and
some
very
subdued
sour
notes
i
can
not
stress
how
incredible
this
beer
has
aged
so
mellow
and
balanced
god
i
need
more
of
this
beer
beermails
sent
d
crazy
good
dakine
i
have
a
man
crush
on
you
pretty
good
drinkability
i
mean
im
not
going
to
chug
something
like
this
but
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
polishing
off
that
is
drinking
not
cleaning
a
bottle
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
you
definitely
want
to
sip
but
i
could
sit
their
for
a
week
straight
sipping
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
luscious
and
complex
this
is
simply
an
amazing
brew
and
i
must
say
old
stock
lends
itself
beautifully
to
well
cared
for
barrel
aging
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
chance
to
sample
to
date
d
a
friend
aged
it
till
2009
really
smooth
given
the
abv
great
beer
overall
chestnut
body
with
a
thin
layer
of
tan
foam
the
head
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
pretty
quickly
but
the
legs
on
this
beer
are
outstanding
incredibly
viscous
stuff
the
aroma
is
a
melange
of
toffee
dates
and
vanilla
brandy
is
readily
apparent
and
lends
a
slight
booziness
that
compliments
the
dark
malts
nicely
as
it
warms
up
i
get
red
grapes
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
sweet
soy
sauce
on
the
tongue
its
rich
fullbodied
and
sweet
with
flavors
of
brandy
and
oak
supported
by
a
huge
caramel
malt
backbone
light
fruitiness
midpalate
leads
to
a
semisweet
vanilla
finish
tannins
add
just
the
right
level
of
balance
preventing
this
from
becoming
cloying
despite
the
richness
and
high
abv
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
low
but
i
think
its
near
perfect
for
the
style
and
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
some
viscosity
the
drinkability
is
very
good
and
while
i
was
enjoying
this
i
had
to
fight
the
urge
to
gulp
my
6
34012925
ounce
pour
great
old
ale
i
do
really
appreciate
the
style
more
and
more
i
had
an
awesome
time
celebrating
the
4th
while
sipping
away
at
this
great
american
brew
i
would
defiantly
seek
out
another
i
think
it
was
well
worth
the
price
d
the
ale
is
hot
but
never
reveals
its
15
price
tag
the
brandy
really
works
amongst
the
malty
depths
of
the
old
stock
big
chewy
body
with
complimentary
carbonation
and
a
boatload
of
warming
alcohol
give
this
brew
a
to
die
for
drinkability
in
my
book
this
brew
is
the
closest
thing
to
angels
share
and
thats
a
great
thing
seek
savor
and
enjoy
this
big
ass
brew
if
given
the
opportunity
serious
stuff
i
realize
this
is
getting
harder
to
come
by
if
not
impossible
to
get
if
you
have
one
consider
yourself
lucky
find
some
friends
and
share
the
bottle
what
a
nose
black
grapes
blueberry
light
oak
warm
alcohol
and
sweet
toffee
and
chocolate
fantastic
not
all
that
impressive
looking
though
the
pour
is
brown
with
some
red
hues
and
a
quickly
fading
soapy
tan
head
wonderful
flavors
ive
always
thought
brandy
barrels
are
the
way
to
do
with
barley
wine
and
this
is
the
best
example
great
grape
wood
toffee
chocolate
flavor
with
a
bit
of
warm
alcohol
to
make
sure
you
know
what
you
are
drinking
medium
body
mouth
filling
average
carbonation
just
enough
to
be
a
complement
average
finish
id
like
it
to
hang
around
for
a
bit
longer
really
though
i
really
cant
think
of
what
else
id
want
in
such
a
beer
its
a
damn
shame
that
its
so
difficult
to
come
by
flavor
is
vanilla
caramel
brown
sugar
and
some
toffee
no
hops
to
be
found
only
a
little
bit
of
warmth
making
this
a
dangerously
easy

drinking
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
wish
i
had
another
but
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
setting
and
was
glad
to
split
this
one
with
a
friend
in
a
word
perfect
this
beer
was
soo
sublime
in
every
way
it
is
hard
to
put
into
words
the
pour
was
wonderul
from
the
rich
caramel
color
that
came
out
of
the
bottle
to
the
nice
puff
of
off
white
that
graced
the
top
it
was
just
spot
on
for
the
style
the
aroma
was
loaded
with
brandy
and
vanilla
notes
hints
of
oak
and
rich
toffee
notes
are
just
all
over
this
one
smooth
as
could
be
with
hardly
a
hint
of
alcohol
even
as
it
approaches
12
percent
is
an
achievment
in
of
itself
the
vanilla
and
toffee
notes
in
here
were
sublime
perfect
balance
here
of
flavors
as
the
i
sat
and
enjoyed
this
one
till
almost
2
am
at
this
point
and
i
still
have
a
half
glass
to
go
this
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
just
what
it
should
be
and
well
well
worth
the
wait
3
15
head
quickly
jumps
to
a
three
finger
carmel
grouping
of
very
active
bubbles
and
then
fades
just
as
quick
leaving
not
a
trace
of
those
bubbles
body
is
a
very
deep
dark
brown
and
quite
consistant
like
molasses
but
not
nearly
as
thick
nose
is
big
and
full
of
rich
bourbon
sweet
toffee
buttered
rum
and
hot
carmalized
malts
alchol
is
very
evident
as
you
take
first
sip
its
not
overly
harsh
just
a
little
warm
and
tingley
toasty
layers
of
carmalized
malt
toffee
overly
ripe
dark
fruit
molasses
and
black
vanilla
are
all
over
the
palate
a
bit
of
spicy
coco
is
there
too
alchol
is
warm
on
the
palate
and
the
belly
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
pick
up
the
oak
character
in
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
like
sucking
on
a
piece
of
butter
rum
candy
oh
so
good
after
dinner
sipper
why
do
these
one
time
release
beers
have
to
be
so
good
in
the
final
reckoning
im
unable
to
pick
a
winner
between
bourbonaged
old
stock
and
brandyaged
old
stock
theyre
both
fantastic
and
they
both
deserve
to
be
released
again
consider
yourself
fortunate
if
you
were
able
to
lay
your
hands
on
either
one
thanks
to
the
incredibly
generous
talisker
for
providing
me
with
both
this
is
a
great
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
quite
simply

of
the
best
beers
ive
ever

a

of
the

would

more

wafts
up

apples

together
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
sugary
caramel
rides
behind
the
dark
fruit
aromas
hints
of
leather
are
noticeable
as
well
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
in
that
the
brandy
is
big
and
right
up
front
in
the
taste
as
well
when
mixed
with
the
sweet
malts
it
lends
a
coconuty
flavor
sweet

the

the
finish

a
drying
alcohol
warmth
burns
at
the
back
of
the
throat
very
good
beer
its
been
a
while
since
i
sampled
the
bourbon
but
i
believe
i
preferred
that
one
though
the
brandy
ageing
shines
through
quite
well
in
most
aspects
of
this
sample
a
delicious
beer
for
a
goodnight
night
cap
one
of
if
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
2008
incredibly
complex
aroma
that
gives
notes
of
raisins
figs
caramel
toffee
from
the
base
beer
as
well
as
added
dimensions
of
brandy
soaked
wood
vanilla
and
coconut
from
the
oak
flavor
consists
of
chocolate
caramel
brandy
coconut
vanilla
dark
fruit
portlike
character
chewy
and
beyond
rich
this
beer
is
amazing
and
a
total
jaw
dropper
thanks
to
steve
for
sharing
tis
one
of
the
best
this
cellar
reserve
this
one
is
drinking
like
a
cherry
mash
dream
in
the
stl
heat
and
the
great
one
sent
two
bottles
so
one
will
be
saved
for
a
nice
wintery
nite
in
december
maybe
xmas
eve
thought
i
would
like
the
bourbon
barrel
version
better
than
this
but
i
was
wrong
reminded
of
the
first
angels
share
i
tasted
in
several
ways
one
of
the
better
old
ales
i
have
tasted
and
the
oak
aging
did
wonders
for
this
one
would
definitely
drink
again
hopefully
north
coast
does
something
like
this
in
the
future
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
hot
on
the
palate
with
booze
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
a
truly
wonderful
fusion
of
flavors
this
is
probably
the
best
brandy
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
the
spirit
character
was
more
integrated
and
delicate
than
other
brandy
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
try
to
get
your
hands
on
some
of
this
d
huge
thanks
to
rallison
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
spent
more
than
two
hours
on
this
one
and
frankly
i
could
have
used
a
little
help
this
was
my
first
brandy
barrel
aged
beer
and
i
hope
i
get
to
enjoy
some
more
maybe
a
bit
thin
lots
of
warming
lingering
alcohol
still
manages
to
not
be
boozy
or
overly
hot
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
so
much
complexity
very
well
made
alcohol
is
definitely
a
factor
nice
and
warming
yet
not
in
an
obtrusive
manner
although
the
alcohol
may
play
a
factor
in
the
less
than
full
mouthfeel
less
than
what
you
would
expect
from
this
dvery
nice
sipper
here
the
potency
limits
how
often
i
would
drink
but
it
is
one
i
would
seek
out
again
this
would
be
nice
in
front
of
a
fire
after
a
day
of
cold
weather
activity
thanks
goes
to
intriqken
for
this
one
pours
a
darker
brown
on
the
first
pour
i
guess
i
was
going
a
wee
bit
too
gentle
and
no
head
formed
at
the
end
there
was
a
thin
creme
head
though
nose
was
strong
with
alcohol
with
some
wood
and
a
sweet
tone
mixed
in
i
got
a
little
worried
when
i
took
a
whiff
because
it
was
leading
me
to
believe
it
was
going
to
be
unbalanced
and
a
bit
intense
but
hey
that
wasnt
the
case
at
all
extremely
smooth
flavor
profile
with
sherry
character
and
some
vanilla
and
a
nice
overall
sweet
tone
really
beautiful
feel
was
smooth
and
a
bit
slick
lower
carbonation
but
it
makes
no
difference
this
is
really
a
great
beer
exceptionally
made
and
so
smooth
to
drink
easily
a
substitution
for
any
after
dinner
drink
it
also
could
be
a
great
gateway
beer
to
showcase
the
possibilities
of
what
can
be
done
i
want
more
and
i
want
it
now
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
d
drinkable
not
in
quantity
but
this
brew
makes
up
for
that
in
deliciousness
and
complexity
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
old
ales
ive
had
if
you
cant
afford
the
200
for
jim
kochs
finest
this
is
a
good
second
bet
high
praise
drinkability
is
good
a
big
huge
beer
that
has
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
yet
another
excellent
crafted
beer
from
north
coast
it
looks
like
i
am
in
the
minority
though
i
like
the
bourbon
barrel
version
better
the
mix
of
caramelized
malt
wood
notes
and
butterscotch
oak
character
in
the
nose
is
incredible
the
barrel
influence
here
is
huge
but
amazingly
it
marries
extremely
well
with
the
base
beer
or
at
the
least
it
is
not
a
harsh
overwhelming
barrel
character
visually
this
beer
was
a
bit
disappointing
with
the
quickly
disappearing
head
but
when
you
take
into
account
the
alcohol
percentage
the
head
was
actually
quite
substantial
i
really
like
that
the
body
of
this
brew
is
not
overly
thick
though
this
is
most
definitely
a
sipping
brew
it
could
use
stand
up
to
a
bit
more
residual
malt
character
though
this
really
is
such
a
great
flavorful
beer
but
in
the
end
it
is
the
lack
of
extra
malty
oomph
that
keeps
this
from
being
the
perfect
marriage
between
barrel
and
malt
still
a
fantastic
brew
but
at
times
it
can
even
be
a
bit
thin
when
compared
to
the
ample
brandy
barrel
notes
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
is
a
fantastically
tasty
brew
the
fact
that
the
flavors
from
the
barrel
are
so
well
integrated
and
somehow
not
overwhelming
despite
being
dominant
really
makes
this
an
incredibly
enjoyable
brew
pick
up
the
base
beer
flavors
a
bit
and
this
would
be
perfect
a
big
enjoyable
potent
beer
for
a
cold
night
deep
and
dark
copper
a
tan
head
disappears
instantly
sharp
aroma
of
brandy
is
strong
but
not
off
putting
this
is
still
a
beer
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
between
the
regular
profile
and
brandy
addition
full
bodied
yet
not
filling
a
great
sipper
for
after
dinner
enjoyment
and
as
a
night
cap
outstanding
beer
from
north
coast
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
34
tan
head
above
the
cloudy
barely
translucent
dark
reddish
brown
brew
head
dwindles
rather
quickly
but
still
a
standout
for
a
ba
old
brew
with
ample
slowfalling
lacing
aroma
is
dark
fruity
alcohol
with
leathery
maltiness
taste
follows
the
nose
the
malt
sweetness
upfront
quickly
falling
to
the
prevalent
alcohol
not
much
room
for
the
fruitiness
or
brandy
character
with
all
the
alcohol
numbing
the
mouth
and
throat
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
but
not
so
much
for
the
ba
old
ale
arena
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
drinkability
an
awesome
beer
north
coast
is
playing
for
keeps
i
certainly
cant
see
me
ever
being
able
to
try
this
one
again
and
thats
just
a
tad
depressing
ive
spent
an
hour
drinking
this
and
each
sip
gets
better
as
it
warms
in
a
few
years
it
will
score
5s
cant
wait
to
try
the
bourbon
barrel
an
excellent
beer
beautifully
rich
and
complex
i
prefer
the
bourbon
barrel
version
but
this
is
still
a
fantastically
well
done
beer
thank
you
for
this
offering
o
a
big
bold
beer
for
sipping
not
as
good
as
i
expected
from
founders
a
little
thin
weak
and
not
rich
enough
for
the
style
i
also
get
very
little
oak
character
more
like
a
fairly
good
barleywine
to
me
i
will
not
seek
this
one
out
again
its
mahogany
color
only
issue
in
the
appearance
is
the
head
which
is
minimal
and
short
lived
i
like
how
the
brewer
used
the
oaks
astringency
coupled
with
the
hops
and
alcohol
the
fact
founders
only
adds
oak
not
oak
and
bourbon
is
also
nice
because
the
oak
only
adds
a
note
to
the
beers
overall
profile
without
dominating
it
its
a
good
beer
thats
fairly
unique
had
on
tap
at
founders
pours
honey
color
great
looking
beer
with
nice
lacing
smell
is
dried
fruit
molasses
alcohol
oak
molasses
and
malt
sweet
and
smooth
very
nice
sipper
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bigger
than
this
beers
appearance
leads
on
and
its
nearly
perfectly
carbonated
poured
from
tap
at
long
wells
nebr
nice
color
with
creamy
white
head
oak
barrel
taste
really
comes
out
bitter
bite
at
the
end
a
near
perfect
beer
body
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
felt
like
it
should
have
been
a
little
richer
in
mouth
feel
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
red
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
and
good
carbonation
the
odor
is
sweet
candy
like
malty
dark
fruits
berry
plum
raisin
vanilla
dry
wood
oak
rich
slightly
floral
the
taste
is
woods
oak
dried
fruits
plum
malty
sweet
spices
grapefruit
bitter
dry
throughout
biscuity
feel
very
chewy
definite
sense
of
the
molasses
and
some
dark
fruit
has
a
scotch
ale
linger
with
a
oak
aged
flavor
as
well
poured
a
beautiful
honey
color
with
thick
milky
head
and
light
lacing
a
very
attractive
beer
the
smell
is
complex
with
fruit
and
spicy
oakiness
the
initial
taste
is
the
molasses
and
malts
but
is
quickly
followed
by
a
blast
of
bitterness
mediumbodied
pleasant
mouth
feel
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
stock
up
when
its
released
in
the
spring
i
bought
a
glass
on
tap
at
the
barrel
chest
last
weekend
and
loved
it
i
understand
it
may
be
here
in
the
bottle
soon
cant
wait
smell
is
different
than
the
taste
smells
a
bit
odd
and
sour
with
some
spice
yet
taste
is
very
malt
forward
and
overwhelmingly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
spiciness
sweetness
lingers
on
the
finish
no
noticeable
hop
presence
to
balance
it
out
hard
to
finish
as

beer
o
this
is
a
very
good
winter
beer
im
sorry
to
say
ive
been
walking
past
this
beer
at
my
local
liquor
store
a
beautiful
crafted
old
ale
2013
vintage
draft
fill
of
a
32oz

poured
into

smell
is

beautiful

is

and

its
great
its
a
heavy
beer
at

abv
one
of
my
favorite
founders
beers
ive
acquired
to
date
this
was
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
went
down
effortlessly
beautiful
colour
smell
but
the
taste
blew
it
off
of
the
charts
i
have
had
most
of
founders
offerings
and
i
didnt
think
they
could
top
the
triple
they
did
this
was
absolutely
amazing
caramel
and
toffee
notes
predominant
in
the
taste
bit
of
a
bitter
dry
finish
balances
out
the
sweet
malt
overall
a
solid
old
ale
are
there
better
to
me
yes
but
for
something
thats
available
as
this
and
with
its
own
distinct
touch
to
it
i
could
argue
dollar
for
dollar
this
is
it
founders
is
a
great
brewery
who
makes
above
average
beers
some
world
class
but
almost
all
of
them
are
solid
within
its
category
this
is
one
of
them
glass
snifter
it
was
great
value
at
6
a
pint
but
deceptively
strong
at
9
8
pity
is
is
only
ever
in
the
pub
for
5
days
at
most
a
year
just
not
my
thing
weird
tastes
going
on
v
medium
value
standard
4
pack
founders
pricing
o
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
founders
i
wish
this
werent
seasonal
nice
balance
and
depth
without
being
too
heavy
almost
sessionable
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
drinks
like
a
solid
barleywine
overall
good
stuff
lots
of
sweet
flavors
and
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
for
balance
really
enjoyed
how
all
the
flavors
and
characteristics
blended
together
to
form
a
coherent
whole
on
this
one
something
id
gladly
drink
again
if
i
had
the
chance
thanks
again
guys
always
appreciate
the
brews
it
was
good
but
you
definitely
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
the
smell
on
this
was
very
nice
malts
whiskey
oak
sweet
smelling
molasses
and
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
somewhat
followed
the
nose
but
in
my
opinion
was
a
lot
better
it
is
definitely
an
old
ale
the
strong
ale
hits
you
first
followed
by
the
oakwhiskey
flavor
but
then
fades
quickly
into
a
kind
of
sweet
aftertaste
i
think
the
molasses
helped
balance
it
out
this
is
not
a
sweet
beer
it
is
dry
and
kind
of
bitter
but
i
thought
the
bitterness
subsided
as
the
beer
warmed
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
beer
with
some
good
friends
or
some
good
old
alone
time
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
enjoyed
with
food
overall
i
have
purchased
every
bottle
i
have
seen
and
can
not
wait
to
seek
this
out
again
in
the
spring
i
still
have
two
bottles
in
my
cellar
from
this
year
i
was
fortunate
to
drink
more
than
my
fair
share
this
year
seek
this
out
i
can
not
see
how
you
could
be
disappointed
355ml

excellent

oaky

a

going

grab
a
good
novel
your

and
relax
in
comfy

with
this
one
very
little
if
any
hop

these
are
going
to
be
good
on
cold
winter
nights
refreshing
finish
and
not
too
syrupy
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
love
that
i
could
get
it
all
summer
this
year
thank
you
founders
founders
has
come
through
yet
again
surprise
surprise
right
ive
never
had
an
old
ale
before
this
one
and
it
tastes
phenomenal
very
malt
forward
but
not
a
malt
bomb
with
a
heavy
aroma
of
molasses
and
ginger
snap
cookies
that
carries
through
their
taste
and
leaves
a
clean
and
heavy
finish
of
malted
molasses
cookies
love
this
would
be
interesting
to
compare
to
a
bottle
fresh
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
kind
of
like
maple
syrup
which
makes
sense
because
it
is
brewed
with
maple
you
can
smell
it
and
taste
it
great
complexity
and
smooth
tasting
for
such
a
high
abv
lots
of
malty
goodness
with
a
hint
of
molasses
very
nice
wood
notes
at
the
end
from
the
oak
aging

abv
whats
not
to
love
begins
sweet
with
bready
hints
which
get
swallowed
by
even
sweeter
sugar
and
molasse
these
stay
in
balance
with
wooden
leathery
heavy
malts
wrapped
up
by
a
slick
bitterness
has
an
oily
spicy
maltiness
to
it
with
vanilla
and
cream
underneath
which
defines
the
character
of
this
brew
it
is
still
pretty
sweet
on
the
palate
but
without
loosing
its
balance
as
it
finishes
with
a
gentle
hoppy
bitterness
of
matured
hops
and
oaky
hints
the
alcohol
gets
perfectly
hidden
by
the
sweet
malts
creating
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
slick
finish
while
being
mediumbodied
o
im
normally
a
fan
of
this
style
but
it
just
doesnt
wow
me
o
more
thick
and
syrupy
than
i
like
and
reminds
me
of
a
barley
wine
which
i
am
no
fan
of
well
done
but
in
my
opinion
not
the
best
old
ale
out
there
a
little
thick
and
overly
sweet
even
so
has
some
good
old
ale
qualities
of
maltiness
light
colour
etc
drank
on
june

2014
im
a
big
fan
of
founders
but
i
gotta
call
it
like
it
is
this
brew
just
isnt
that
great
it
would
be
one
thing
if
suffering
through
the
harsh
mouthfeel
and
weird
aftertaste
led
to
something
great
but
this
beer
is
pretty
onedimensional
overall
makes
for
an
excellent
sipping
beer
and
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
dubbel
without
that
distinct
belgian
yeast
character
my
first
experience
with
the
style
but
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
to
try
i
could
see
this
pairing
very
well
with
a
sweet
creamy
cheese
like
brie
or
with
anything
gingerbread
to
bring
out
the
molasses
flavors
in
both
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
cant
help
but
look
at
the
bottle
after
your
first
sip
it
isnt
as
solid
as
north
coast
old
stock
ale
but
it
sure
is
a
more
than
suitable
alternative
very
much
recommended
tried
this
at
a
tasting
in
amherst
wi
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
my
mom
whos
not
much
of
a
craft
beer
drinker
really
liked
it
she
must
have
gone
back
for
5
or
6
glasses
of
it
of
course
now
i
see
that
it
is
almost
10
abv
so
i
understand
why
she
was
acting
a
little
loopy
o
very
enjoyable
beer
fairly
complex
with
flavors
standing
out
nicely
some
nice
minor
flavor
undertones
that
make
for
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
4
255
overall
an
interesting
beer
actually
my
first
old
ale
it
is
a
butt
kicker
in
the
buzz
department
go
easy
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
probably
try
again
as
other
have
mentioned
the
carbonation
level
is
surprising
low
the
best
thing
i
can
compare
its
level
to
is
that
of
a
firkin
aged
beer
a
potent
fullbodied
creamy
sipper
for
finishing
things
off
whatever
those
things
may
be
on
the
right
note
othis
is
a
very
solid
old
ale
the
smell
is
plain
but
the
taste
is
more
complex
and
provides
more
depth
thanks
to
the
more
assertive
hop
flavors
and
kick
of
alcohol
spice
the
sweetness
levels
are
high
here
so
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
it
makes
for
a
fine
desserttype
beer
pours
out
a
deep
reddish
caramel
with
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
brown
sugar
and
dried
fruits
lots
of
fig
and
date
flavor
is
big
on
brown
sugar
dried
fruits
cinnamon
vanilla
with
a
touch
of
coffee
carbonation
is
soft
body
is
full
this
is
delicious
and
very
british
this
is
the
only
old
ale
ive
ever
tried
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
its
pretty
similar
to
a
scottish
ale
if
you
like
sweet
maltforward
beers
this
should
be
enjoyable
that
happens
to
be
a
little
skewed
for
my
tastes
but
its
still
another
engaging
offering
from
founders
nonetheless
id
be
curious
to
try
it
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
under
its
belt
overall
this
fits
the
old
ale
style
of
brew
with
the
big
alcohol
bite
up
front
and
the
big
flavors
as
well
a
little
miscast
in
the
spring
release
mode
but
tasty
nonetheless
o
good
not
great
but
certainly
worth
a
drink
and
with
its
mass
availability
its
probably
something
i
will
visit
a
couple
times
a
year
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
is
remarkable
founders
has
done
it
right
a
mustbuy
bod
41312
similar
head
but
hazy
with
flocculants
the
nose
is
similar
but
quite
subdued
bourbon
is
the
most
prevalent
while
the
dark
fruits
have
receded
same
body
and
carbonation
like
the
nose
flavors
have
also
gone
downhill
age
has
decomplexed
the
flavor
profile
while
still
outstanding
it
just
doesnt
reach
out
and
grab
you
everything
is
there
but
in
a
subdued
fashion
and
more
of
a
blended
presentation
rather
than
a
progression
on
the
palate
on
its
own
i
would
give
the
aged
version
a
4
1
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
one
that
im
glad
i
let
sit
for
a
while
before
opening
up
despite
the
strength
of
the
beer
it
was
one
that
went
down
pretty
well
with
a
great
balance
between
flavours
i
could
see
this
being
one
that
i
would
pick
up
again
in
future
assuming
of
course
i
can
find
it
easily
enough
despite
the
age
and
flatness
this
is
a
pretty
damn
tasty
beer
i
can
imagine
what
its
like
when
its
on
and
dialed
in
i
may
not
be
particularly
impressed
this
time
around
but
im
impressed
enough
that
i
will
certainly
try
it
again
cheers
overall
this
beer
rocks
just
another
solid
offering
by
founders
i
can
see
myself
seeking
this
out
again
i
was
really
impressed
by
the
colors
of
this
brew
awesome
nice
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
moderate
haze
a
very
faint
trace
of
foam
is
only
present
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
a
faint
bit
of
brussels
malt
is
present
strong
aroma
of
light
malt
is
present
to
the
point
of
a
gentle
sweetness
the
taste
is
an
assault
of
light
malt
with
a
strong
sweet
component
theres
a
thicksticky
mouthfeel
if
you
like
plenty
of
maltthis
is
up
your
alley
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
founders
or
any
beer
period
its
a
great
dessert
beer
for
when
you
dont
want
a
ba
stout
it
treads
the
same
waters
but
is
much
less
heavy
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
what
a
supereasydrinking
bourbon
would
be
like
with
the
caramel
oakiness
and
robust
alcohol
presence
such
an
incredible
beer
o
some
might
knock
it
because
of
its
lack
of
complexity
but
that
is
exactly
what
i
like
about
it
a
sweet
ale
that
tastes
better
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
im
sold
051914
from
bottle
as
im
on
a
barrel
aged
kick
lately
no
stone
shall
go
unturned
here
is
a
fine
example
of
how
pervasive
oaking
can
be
until
of
course
it
meets
something
just
as
persuasive
as
the
molasses
used
here
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
no
head
to
speak
of
so
that
leaves
the
battle
on
the
tongue
between
the
oak
the
treacle
each
as
its
moment
but
neither
comes
out
a
winner
i
enjoyed
it
but
could
not
get
past
the
novelty
effect
i
suspect
a
draft
portion
or
better
yet
a
nitro
pour
could
lift
this
to
another
level
liked
this
from
the
bottle
love
this
on
tap
holy
hound
taproom
york
pa
into
snifter
pours
a
gorgeous
clear
deep
amber
with
a
modest
light
tan
head
rich
fullbodied
sweet
chewy
but
not
syrupy
a
little
bitterness
but
predominantly
molasses
alcohol
definitely
makes
its
presence
known
but
complements
the
flavors
rather
than
detracting
from
them
nice
sweet
aftertaste
one
of
my
top
ten
beers
of
any
style
overall
this
is
tasty
and
certainly
fits
in
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
from
this
style
solid
beer
great
flavour
and
well
balanced
really
like
this
a
fantastic
old
ale
the
appearance
was
very
dark
brown
with
a
sticky
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
during
drinking
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
wood
and
malt
in
it
the
taste
was
great
with
a
lot
of
the
wood
giving
a
very
mellow
flavor
which
then
opened
up
to
a
very
nutty
flavor
which
i
thought
was
a
nice
finish
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
overall
i
absolutely
loved
the
beer
and
would
highly
recommend
big
smooth
body
helped
along
by
the
hefty
carbonation
i
believe
this
beer
is
kind
of
overrated
not
what
i
expected
as
it
warms
theres
an
aroma
of
toffee
candied
orange
a
hint
of
tobacco
and
leather
and
hop
aroma
its
died
down
after
2
years
but
theres
still
a
bit
of
a
pronounced
bitterness
on
the
palate
i
taste
candied
orange
tobacco
malty
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
hint
of
something
nutty
on
the
finish
tasty
this
beer
was
just
ok
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
it
was
missing
something
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
o
this
one
is
still
way
too
hot
ill
be
putting
away
the
other
bottles
i
have
for
at
least
a
year
or
two
and
revisit
but
for
the
time
being
the
flavors
just
havent
meshed
yet
overall
pretty
delicious
wish
i
had
more
than
just
this
one
12oz
bottle
i
can
imagine
it
pairing
well
with
a
blue
cheese
burger
and
steak
fries
hmm
that
sounds
good
anyone
up
for
a
burger
joint
great
picture
on
the
bottle
that
conveys
the
classic
taste
if
an
old
ale
with
molasses
this
could
have
been
a
really
great
one
o
wouldnt
recommend
so
bland
except
high
abv
which
is
benefit
for
nascar
redneck
fans
o
wow
oak
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
could
do
with
a
little
less
oak
though
odd
this
beer
is
a
very
dark
ruby
red
it
looks
like
burnt
sugar
there
is
almost
no
carbonation
at
all
it
smells
like
old
wood
probably
aged
in
barrels
and
like
wine
and
fruits
taste
not
like
a
beer
in
the
traditional
sense
very
flat
and
without
fizz
it
feels
like
drinking
a
fortified
wine
interesting
to
say
the
least
if
old
ale
was
not
on
the
description
i
would
have
dismissed
it
pours
a
nice
beautiful
reddish
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipates
not
much
aroma
first
sip
is
not
much
sweetness
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
oak
barrel
and
finishes
with
a
strong
alcohol
kick
was
looking
for
more
maple
goodness
as
you
drink
more
and
the
beer
warms
up
the
maple
and
molasses
start
to
come
through
a
very
nice
beer
starts
becoming
like
a
fine
cognac
be
careful
as
that
almost
10
will
kick
you
real
quick
the
taste
is
what
makes
it
all
worthwhile
as
the
molasses
and
caramel
malts
are
voracious
in
their
presentation
with
only
a
vague
alcohol
burn
you
would
get
more
booze
in
a
malt
liquor
mildly
bitter
finish
wonderfully
drinkable
for
what
it
is
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
liked
this
one
a
sipper
for
sure
nicely
done
o
a
decent
showing
here
by
the
old
curmudgeon
may
he
age
with
the
best
of
them
nice
beer
maybe
a
little
more
boozy
than
i
would
have
wanted
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
fun
to
drink
as
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
it
its
oak
aged
and
contains
molasses
it
has
a
good
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
the
hops
its
a
good
dessert
beer
but
would
probably
pair
well
with
the
right
foods
overall
an
excellent
old
ale
the
mouth
feel
transitions
well
to
the
taste
which
is
nicely
rounded
out
by
the
finish
i
would
have
preferred
a
stronger
aroma
however
with
warming
the
aroma
has
a
pronounced
oak
poured
a
ruby
brown
with
a
slight
creamy
white
head
no
retention
almost
not
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
nice
oak
pungency
with
hints
of
molasses
the
taste
is
awesome
with
the
ale
flavors
caramel
dark
fruit
in
the
forefront
with
just
a
hint
of
the
oak
providing
a
nice
counter
there
is
a
nice
weight
to
the
beer
my
preference
would
have
been
a
little
thicker
and
a
pleasant
silky
feel
to
it
a
great
barrelaged
ale
overall
this
is
a
terrific
homage
to
this
style
a
sweet
molassescreamcaramelcandycherry
delight
a
typically
strong
showing
from
founders
definitely
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
light
brownish
creamy
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
the
head
was
not
very
frothy
to
begin
with
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
dark
color
with
hints
of
ruby
the
beer
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
a
little
bit
tarty
the
strong
notes
are
caramel
with
mix
of
molasses
and
oak
with
a
bit
of
a
cherry
smell
the
oak
is
weakest
of
the
notes
but
still
works
very
well
giving
that
nice
harsh
nonsweet
note
at
the
end
of
a
very
sweet
bouquet
the
smell
also
contains
lightly
roasted
malt
notes
that
add
a
bit
of
a
cereal
smell
without
compromising
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
few
exceptions
the
oak
note
is
stronger
and
dulls
the
caramel
and
fruity
sweetness
no
roasted
malt
notes
the
molasses
note
is
weaker
in
the
taste
and
adds
a
nice
tarty
note
at
the
end
the
taste
also
has
an
overall
cherry
note
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
and
a
little
a
bit
thick
while
overall
smooth
the
beer
feels
like
its
going
down
a
little
slower
biting
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
old
ale
and
worth
getting
when
you
can
o
a
nice
sipper
the
cherries
overwhelmed
just
a
bit
on
the
finish
but
overall
a
terrific
old
ale
the
old
stock
we
had
right
before
still
blew
this
one
away
o
vastly
exceeded
my
expectation
overall
an
excellent
old
ale
great
balance
and
complexity
flavors
are
bold
and
distinct
and
all
complimentary
nearly
a
perfect
symphony
a
pleasant
warming
alcohol
heat
after
each
sip
ive
aged
this
one
for
2
years
before
opening
and
it
is
silky
smooth
fantastic
pours
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
very
high
density
the
beer
is
very
clear
and
a
nice
bare
color
nice
head
retention
amber
malt
nuttiness
pretty
faint
under
that
head
light
malt
sweetness
has
an
alcohol
warmth
to
it
bread
some
spice
caramel
hints
of
grain
palate
soft
carbonation
very
heavy
and
thick
mouthfeel
alcohol
on
the
aftertaste
the
taste
hides
the
abv
very
well
and
you
can
tell
it
is
well
made
when
you
drink
it
due
to
the
seriousness
of
the
beer
overall
a
delicious
beer
rjt
o
pretty
awesome
a
lot
more
fruity
than
expected
definitely
enjoy
it
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
unlike
many
this
is
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
right
from
the
start
definitely
will
go
in
the
category
to
have
again
4s
across
the
board
well
done
thanks
of
brewing
this
one
for
us
i
can
intellectualize
the
quality
of
good
old
ales
but
i
think
i
just
dont
like
them
this
one
definitely
carries
a
much
less
offensive
combo
of
cardboard
and
leather
ive
seen
in
others
like
north
coast
old
stock
or
anchor
old
foghorn
wait
thats
an
english
barley
wine
i
actually
love
bells
old
ale
so
whatre
ya
gonna
do
o
another
fine
offering
from
founders
im
hoping
aging
will
mellow
the
hot
alcohol
flavors
they
definitely
have
a
headache
flavor
i
hope
it
relaxes
into
the
body
in
a
few
months
overall
an
incredibly
tasty
choice
for
those
who
dig
a
big
bold
malty
sweet
beer
it
may
not
be
something
that
id
personally
drink
very
often
im
already
a
ticker
as
it
is
but
there
is
absolutely
no
denying
that
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
that
warrants
a
try
to
any
beer
aficionado
i
may
go
buy
myself
another
single
just
to
see
how
this
thing
ages
it
is
sweet
as
hell
but
it
is
equally
as
tasty
o
conforming
to
all
my
other
experiences
with
founders
beers
this
was
incredible
i
rarely
drink
old
ales
i
know
this
is
not
my
first
but
i
cant
remember
my
last
but
this
one
will
always
stick
with
me
expensive
yet
its
nose
and
mouth
candy
got
to
have
this
one
ale
with
good
medium
fruity
sweet
sugary
notes
and
definitely
oaky
notes
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spice
hint
of
an
apple
or
some
lighter
fruit
pretty
complex
and
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
well
balanced
and
just
really
nice
well
rounded
beer
not
much
hop
presence
o
a
very
true
representation
of
the
style
and
one
mighty
balance
if
i
may
add
this
is
an
old
ale
definitely
worth
looking
for
and
for
saving
some
i
didnt
expect
to
see
this
want
of
mine
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
a
random
store
in
australia
if
i
didnt
need
to
fly
across
the
pacific
i
might
have
grabbed
a
few
to
sit
on
smells
sweet
malty
and
rusticearthy
the
good
parts
of
earth
taste
sweet
malty
and
a
little
musty
dont
get
a
bunch
of
the
oak
it
also
comes
across
a
little
hot
on
the
alcohol
side
i
know
it
is
a
strong
beer
but
it
doesnt
hide
that
fact
well
i
really
think
it
could
improve
over
time
if
not
maybe
dial
it
back
a
bit
on
the
abv
the
alcohol
is
suppressing
some
of
the
flavors
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
that
will
kick
you
in
the
ass
and
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
rainy
day
bored
with
very
little
leasing
slightly
amber
and
cloudy
notes
smell
is
lately
muted
in
glass
with
hints
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
bread
some
tropical
notes
are
found
overall
it
is
a
white
tropical
compared
to
the
aged
old
curmudgeon
that
i
sat
on
for
2
years
ahead
papaya
and
mango
now
its
definitely
better
in
the
bottle
but
worth
a
try
o
another
solid
seasonal
from
founders
never
tasted
a
beer
with
these
specific
traits
excellent
plus
it
helped
me
pick
out
a
new
nickname
for
the
old
lady
opretty
surprised
very
enjoyable
great
sipper
still
a
4
based
on
my
previous
rating
but
with
some
notes
poured
a
deep
transluscent
amber
virtually
no
head
noticeable
carbonation
molasses
raisins
some
wood
and
a
bit
of
booze
on
the
nose
really
came
together
in
the
taste
department
dark
fruit
oak
super
clean
and
smooth
not
overly
sweetmolasses
etc
overall
a
really
nice
balance
the
bitterness
cuts
in
nicely
without
being
overpowering
medium
body
covered
the
palate
nicely
and
had
a
really
smooth
finish
just
a
strong
example
of
a
sipper
that
will
put
you
in
a
luxurious
state
of
mind
get
some
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
some
light
getting
in
around
the
edges
less
than
a
finger
of
head
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
and
it
fades
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
rather
imposing
with
molasses
sweet
malt
burnt
sugar
coconut
toasted
oats
and
oak
the
same
profile
comes
out
in
the
taste
along
with
some
raisin
and
fruity
esters
its
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
dubbel
but
overly
boozy
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
here
this
is
all
malt
carbonation
is
low
and
the
body
is
medium
overall
this
was
a
much
easier
drinking
beer
than
i
was
expecting
nice
moderate
carbonation
and
syrupy
body
o
this
beer
is
amazing
lands
in
the
night
cap
category
high
alcohol
with
tons
of
bourbon
characteristics
would
go
great
with
a
sweet
dessert
o
a
very
easy
drinking
high
abv
old
ale
that
has
incredible
balance
but
keeps
me
interested
all
the
way
to
the
last
sip
pours
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
very
weak
head
has
a
malty
aroma
with
light
hints
of
fruit
feels
heavy
like
molasses
and
has
a
lightly
sweet
molasses
and
malty
flavor
there
is
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
to
offset
the
subtle
sweetness
very
enjoyable
complex
ale
overall
i
opened
this
one
a
bit
before
the
two
year
mark
since
ive
heard
it
does
not
age
very
well
however
this
is
drinking
quite
fine
at
the
moment
and
i
think
it
could
keep
progressing
lots
of
nice
sweet
maltyness
floral
alcohol
and
a
surprising
hop
bite
recommend
stock
for
your
cellar
a
decent
ale
but
not
one
id
clamor
to
try
again
o
interesting
strong
ale
o
dont
you
just
love
it
when
you
drink
a
beer
not
expecting
to
like
it
but
walk
away
with
a
new
favorite
i
loved
this
beer
super
balance
huge
decadent
flavors
and
awesome
complexity
i
will
be
buying
a
sixer
as
soon
as
humanly
possible
aroma
was
a
boozy
sweet
caramel
poured
headless
cloudy
ruddy
body
holding
to
light
shows
floating
particulates
taste
is
alcoholic
and
bitteracidic
overall
nasty
for
me
the
drinkability
of
this
old
ale
is
what
sets
it
apart
from
the
crowd
these
go
down
way
too
easy
for
me
i
am
usually
a
stout
sipper
but
sometimes
i
just
want
to
get
drunk
when
i
am
in
that
kind
of
mood
this
is
my
go
to
beer
served
just
above
freezing
these
provide
me
with
a
great
tasting
malty
beer
that
gets
the
job
done
quick
for
me
the
best
tasting
most
complex
beer
i
can
drink
in
large
quantities
one
to
cellar

classic
english
old

just
another
masterpiece
brewed
by
founders
man
this
is
founders
malt
brilliance
at
full
form
here
i
really
wish
i
had
tried
the
maple
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
of
this
some
years
back
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
the
old
ale
style
and
it
seems
to
only
get
better
with
age
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
i
should
have
had
a
damn
cigar
for
this
occasion
absolutely
as
with
all
of
this
brewerys
malt
forward
beers
completely
recommended
overall
founders
kills
it
again
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
old
ale
done
right
overall
a
solid
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
all
types
of
beer
lovers
molasses
adds
some
sweetness
to
counteract
the
bold
malt
flavor
while
oak
comes
in
to
mellow
it
all
out
ive
come
a
long
way
and
looking
at
the
other
reviews
i
thought
i
give
this
guy
another
go
and
it
pours
a
reddish
copper
hue
with
a
creamy
one
finger
headthe
smell
is
quite
sweet
its
molasseshoneyoak
and
hidden
underneath
there
is
a
piney
hop
bitternessthe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
and
could
use
just
a
touch
more
i
feel
and
on
taste
its
definitely
an
old
ale
with
hints
of
molassescaramelbitter
old
hopsa
residing
pine
bitterness
and
finished
with
nice
hit
of
oak
that
is
quite
subdued
and
works
well
and
overall
its
one
of
those
beers
thats
nice
but
not
something
ill
come
back
and
revisit
like
breakfast
stout
or
all
day
ipa
cheers
not
as
complex
as
the
best
of
the
style
and
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
i
dont
know
if
theres
enough
there
to
improve
with
age
guess
ill
have
to
find
out
rich
malt
backbone
overall
a
very
enjoyable
sweet
and
malty
brew
just
what
an
old
ale
should
be
would
recommend

really
very
nice
chalk
up
another
old
ale
for
me
i
have
yet
to
have
something
called
old
ale
that
i
dislike
o
a
fine
fallwinter
warming
sipper
although
founders
releases
it
in
the
spring
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
o
this
one
is
a
slow
sipper
and
its
damn
good
well
done
founders
would
like
to
age
this
one
for
a
few
years
notes
review
on
5214
bottled
41912
overall
this
aged
pretty
well
i
think
it
has
a
very
slight
edge
over
fresh
the
flavors
mellowed
out
a
bit
the
oaky
flavors
dropped
off
a
bit
it
seems
like
it
is
in
a
good
balance
with
the
sweetness
the
woodiness
and
the
alcohol
right
now
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
not
overpowering
wood
aspects
but
it
provides
a
nice
extra
note
molasses
on
the
other
hand
really
comes
out
good
fresh
and
aged
and
worth
picking
up
and
stashing
a
few
away
very
interesting
to
say
the
least
i
think
this
has
been
one
of
the
more
complex
beers
that
ive
tasted
i
bought
a
few
4
packs
of
this
several
years
and
wasnt
too
impressed
but
i
held
on
to
them
and
am
i
glad
i
did
several
months
ago
i
opened
up
a
2011
and
was
very
happy
i
did
i
actually
had
to
fish
the
bottle
out
of
the
trash
to
make
sure
it
was
the
beer
i
thought
i
had
just
opened
fortunately
it
was
still
readily
available
on
the
shelves
so
i
picked
up
a
few
more
knowing
id
then
be
able
to
enjoy
them
in
a
few
years
omy
first
old
ale
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
a
lot
like
a
bda
but
with
a
nice
oaked
nuance
well
balanced
on
all
aspects
founders
did
it
again
total

the
beer
is
too
flat
not
much
going
in
in
the
mouth
but
in
the
end
the
taste
is
ok
34
year
old

not
much

or
lacing
muddy
tudor
brown

includes
brown
sugar
raisin
date
vanilla
taste
includes
all
of
these
flavors
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
heat
delicious
in
every
way
one
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
had
reddish
orange
color
smells
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hop
definitely
different
than
an
english
style
old
ale
but
very
good
taste
is
surprisingly
bitter
ends
up
being
like
a
barelywine
very
good
taste
just
not
what
i
expected
from
my
experience
drinking
english
style
old
ales
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
the
carbonation
is
really
where
this
beer
shines
it
gives
it
a
creamy
and
viscous
feel
overall
its
good
overall
good
though
not
great
the
molasses
is
a
bit
strong
for
my
liking
the
flavor
has
a
good
amount
of
malty
sweetness
with
caramel
toffee
and
molasses
quite
noticeable
you
can
also
get
a
taste
of
what
the
wood
contributes
here
too
i
also
get
intimations
of
rumsoaked
brownbread
there
is
earthy
hoppiness
here
as
well
while
the
finish
exhibits
some
alcoholic
heat
pretty
good
in
small
doses
prosit
1588
if
you
see
it
buy
it
another
winner
from
founders
i
will
be
purchasing
this
again
overall
some
age
1
year
mellowed
this
out
quite
a
bit
but
this
is
still
a
sipper
for
sure
as
far
as
old
ales
go
this
isnt
the
best
but
its
a
damn
good
one
o
better
than
some
of
the
other
old
ales
ive
had
i
like
the
lack
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
of
carmudgeon
old
ales
tend
to
be
very
sweet
for
me
but
this
one
had
a
nice
balance
to
it
normally
id
be
one
and
done
with
an
old
ale
but
i
could
see
myself
wanting
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
overall
its
a
beer
everyone
should
try
clearly
a
sipper
it
goes
down
easier
than
a
barleywine
or
dipa
and
is
mostly
pleasant
for
the
duration
bursts
of
molasses
and
malty
sugars
create
a
unique
experience
but
one
lacking
in
complexity
o
a
very
good
beer
solid
complexity
and
good
flavors
without
any
noticeable
flaws
tasteoakey
spiciness
sweet
malt
molasses
maple
syrup
dose
of
underlying
hops
keeps
things
from
getting
too
sweet
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
warms
as
it
warms
sip
this
one
slowly
and
enjoy
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
only
in
smaller
doses
due
to
the
booziness
i
know
very
little
about
the
style
this
being
my
first
one
but
going
by
the
description
for
old
ale
on
ba
curmudgeon
is
a
prototypical
example
enjoy
very
full
rich
flavor
of
grape
chocolatey
malt
caramel
wine
cognac
and
prune
hints
of
molasses
oak
and
malt
hold
the
backbone
but
the
alcohol
rich
flavors
of
fermented
or
distilled
grapes
overtakes
slight
warmth
in
the
chest
does
not
deter
but
defines
a
wonderful
winter
warmerfireplace
sipping
ale
overall
definitely
different
than
most
beers
reminds
me
of
samiclaus
helles
which
in
my
craft
beer
infancy
was
my
favorite
just
so
incredibly
heavy
its
overbearing
tastes
like
it
will
go
well
with
a
cigar
smooth
and
rich
full
bodied
with
a
mediumlight
effervescence
this
old
ale
is
unlike
most
in
that
it
doesnt
need
to
warm
to
be
great
it
starts
there
warming
does
make
it
a
touch
smoother
but
not
enough
to
make
you
want
to
wait
a
truly
great
brew
onice
sipping
old
ale
smooth
and
well
balanced
poured
into
a
snifter
from
the
bottle
the
ale
poured
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
as
the
head
receded
it
left
a
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
spiciness
that
tickles
the
insides
of
the
nose
on
can
even
detect
a
faint
hint
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
the
burn
of
spicy
cinnamon
caramel
dark
fruits
mild
vanilla
and
of
course
the
malts
the
malts
bring
to
mind
a
well
constructed
dark
bread
in
the
aftertaste
the
spicy
alcohol
meshes
with
the
dark
malts
to
make
this
ale
come
full
circle
the
thickness
allows
the
malt
and
alcohol
to
linger
with
time
this
old
ale
will
mature
and
reward
its
owned
the
rest
of
this
4
pack
is
going
to
the
cellar
to
sleep
copper
body
with
yellowwhite
lace
enticing
smells
of
oak
vanilla
toffee
and
chocolate
pudding
taste
is
a
let
down
reminds
me
of
cheap
bourbon
woody
stale
and
soapy
possibly
the
chewiest
beer
ive
ever
had
with
a
metallic
twitch
at
the
end
overall
repeat
what
i
stated
above
unique
and
highly
enjoyable
might
be
the
best
old
ale
ive
ever
tried
another
excellent
offering
from
founders
o
i
kept
thinking
i
had
to
come
back
to
this
one
but
for
one
reason
or
another
the
bad
original
four
pack
most
likely
i
did
not
without
the
semi
turned
smell
it
makes
for
a
much
better
experience
this
4
pack
was
from
frougles
recommended
overall
this
aged
well
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
its
got
everything
im
looking
for
it
mellowed
and
allowed
more
complexity
to
show
with
some
age
an
awesome
sipper
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
definetly
a
slow
sipper
another
winner
from
founders
overall
i
found
this
beer
pretty
tasty
and
quite
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
for
the
alcohol
content
not
something
i
would
be
interested
in
buying
a
four
pack
of
but
something
i
could
see
myself
getting
yearly
as
a
single
theres
a
lot
of
depth
and
complexity
to
this
old
ale
despite
its
mixed
reviews
its
a
great
beer
for
someone
who
likes
a
dubbel
with
a
bit
more
punch
so
what
goes
well
with
this
beer
well
maybe
the
music
curmudgeon
of
all
time
that
is
right
jazz
saxophone
player
son
of
a
bitch
phil
fuck
you
woods
i
recommend
an
illegal
download
of
his
live
at
the
showboat
or
a
good
version
of
his
version
of
the
tune
freedom
jazz
dance
from
the
lp
swiss
radio
days
jazz
series
overall
this
is
good
for
the
style
ill
probably
crack
anothor
bottle
in
6
months
or
so
o
this
is
a
great
blend
of
sweet
syrupy
malt
and
bitter
hops
encompassed
by
oak
o
good
beer
its
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
is
a
big
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
even
one
bottle
is
a
bit
much
that
being
said
it
has
a
lot
of
good
flavor
and
is
quite
drinkable
o
wonderful
lingering
finish
leaves
me
coming
back
for
more
the
oak
and
molassis
really
shine
88
overall
really
really
impressed
with
this
brew
i
heard
a
lot
about
founders
and
this
was
my
first
try
from
the
brewery
i
cant
wait
to
try
others
this
old
ale
is
really
big
on
flavor
o
very
impressive
beer
worlds
of
flavor
in
this
beer
that
all
seem
to
blend
together
perfectly
a
good
strong
beer
at
9
8
abv
but
it
manages
to
go
down
very
smoothly
leaving
just
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
behind
o
delicious
experience
highly
recommended
i
thought
this
beer
reminded
me
more
of
something
that
dogfish
head
would
put
out
rather
than
founders
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
o
call
me
crazy
i
know
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
and
way
better
stuff
coming
out
of
founders
o
good
dessert
beer
a
bit
much
on
its
own
but
i
suspect
it
would
be
fantastic
with
a
fruit
based
desert
o
my
girlfriend
just
picked
up
a
case
of
this
for
me
and
it
is
good
fresh
but
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
held
onto
this
bad
boy
for
a
little
too
long
were
getting
founders
next
month
here
in
florida
and
this
guy
will
be
a
bit
less
special
curmudgeon
pours
a
hazy
redorange
with
tons
of
sediment
it
has
a
rather
attractive
glow
though
the
aroma
is
muted
presenting
sweet
toffee
oak
and
honey
the
taste
hits
with
an
intense
sweet
oak
right
away
along
with
a
big
sweet
malt
and
honey
presence
sweet
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
surprisingly
for
all
the
sweet
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
good
probably
better
if
you
can
down
sweet
beers
quickly
overall
curmudgeon
is
a
good
example
of
a
style
thats
never
been
my
favorite
reddish
brown
quick

is

that
certainly
lives
up
to
the
description
of
an
old
ale
brewed
with
molasses
and
oak
aged
the
old
ale
characteristics
molasses
flavors
and
oak
presence
are
all
there
in
a
nice
harmonized
way
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
develops
with
age
o
really
nice
brew
not
overly
sweet
or
assertive
but
very
enjoyable
to
drink
i
find
myself
enjoying
all
of
the
founders
offerings
and
this
one
is
no
exception
o
really
nice
beer
but
not
a
style
i
am
drawn
to
and
thus
not
overly
impressive
the
molasses
the
oak
addition
helped
make
the
beer
fuller
at
least
i
imagine
it
did
i
can
see
a
bourbon
barrel
doing
wonders
for
this
o
im
going
to
have
to
hide
the
other
3
bottles
before
i
drink
them
warm
this
was
a
great
beer
highly
complex
with
the
addition
of
the
oak
im
disappointed
that
i
let
this
one
slip
into
the
fold
when
i
was
the
the
nyc
craft
beerfest
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
instead
focused
solely
on
the
kbs
so
much
so
that
the
server
knew
my
name
this
beer
is
an
understated
powerhouse
got
on
tap
at
bryant
lake
bowl
not
picking
up
a
lot
of
aroma
on
this
one
but
a
lot
of
good
things
happening
once
i
tasted
it
aftertaste
was
fantastic
with
a
lot
of
carmel
and
roastiness
with
mayble
a
little
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
was
great
on

very
good
creaminess
intensely
barrel
flavored
with
a
distinct

taste
better
earlier
on
with
the
frothy
foam
maple
molasses
and
sweet
yams
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
overbearing
great
version
of
the
old
barrel
trick
o
a
tasty
brew
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
here

i
was
getting
a

aroma
of
shall
i
say
an
illegal
substance
it
smelled
like
i
was
at

syrupy
taste
a

with
a
boozy
backbone
hint

taste
heavy
and
captures
the
old
foggy

feeling
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
ale
however
it
is
very
drinkable
founders
has
somehow
managed
to
hide
9
8
abv
without
a
trace
this
beer
is
not
for
the
hoppy
connoisseur
you
need
a
sweet
appreciative
palate
to
drink
this
i
have
that
this
is
a
great
warm
weather
brew
that
distinguishes
itself
from
the
refreshing
crowd
that
usually
features
citris
notes
i
want
to
age
a
few
bottles
and
see
what
i
get

i
found
this
stuff

final
thoughts
i
couldnt
detect
any
molasses
in
the
flavor
but
curmudgeon
old
ale
is
pretty
much
as
advertised
if
you
like
old
ales
and
barleywines
but
dont
want
the
big
bitterness
that
goes
along
with
them
then
id
recommend
it
the
oakaging
has
really
smoothed
out
the
hops
and
given
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
would
i
drink
it
again
unlikely
too
many
other
beers
to
try
at
this
point
o
while
im
not
as
wellversed
in
old
ales
this
one
is
a
particularly
drinkable
one
with
wonderful
flavors
of
molasses
and
oak
o
overall
a
nice
old
ale
with
an
added
oak
treatment
that
just
adds
the
icing
on
the
cake
as
far
as
complexity
goes
and
it
just
gets
better
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
a
perfect
lingering
winterspring
evening
sipper
o
this
one
tastes
a
little
different
with
every
drink
great
complexity
but
not
all
over
the
place
the
balance
of
sweet
but
not
being
overly
sweet
with
some
bitterness
and
the
oak
character
was
done
really
well
glad
i
have
a
couple
to
age
as
well
im
interested
to
see
what
happens
with
some
age
overall
in
every
way
a
solid
brew
no
glaring
weaknesses
one
of
the
first
brews
i
had
when
i
was
starting
up
and
still
impresses
me
i
also
had
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
of
growler
of
this
and
that
was
an
eventful
night
a
bit
pricey
overall
but
more
then
worth
a
shot
it
reminds
me
of
a
toned
down
stone
double
bastard
its
quite
smooth
i
think
i
prefer
the
double
bastard
because
of
its
hoppiness
and
complexity
but
this
is
still
quite
wonderful
spend
a
lot
of
time
enjoying
this
one
o
a
solid
oakaged
old
ale
not
overwhelming
with
the
oak
but
it
is
nicely
imparted
not
overly
complex
but
a
true
malt
bomb
and
a
solid
brew
overall
a
great
beer
similar
to
a
barleywine
booze
is
well
hidden
here
for
16
a
four
pack
i
cant
say
i
would
buy
more
than
one
a
year
but
its
a
nice
pick
up
a
chunky
amber
pour
lots
of
floating
sediment
slight
white
rim
of
head
smells
almost
like
a
barley
wine
very
sweet
malty
profile
caramel
plum
vanilla
smells
pretty
boozy
tastes
much
like
a
very
strong
barley
wine
mixed
with
some
scotch
not
sure
if
this
is
bourbon
barrel
aged
or
what
but
it
definitely
tastes
that
way
bourbon
oak
vanilla
tons
of
barley
caramel
banana
plum
raisins
a
full
bodied
ale
with
some
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
very
heavy
boozy
thick
and
rich
beers
like
this
are
perfect
for
just
sitting
back
relaxing
and
sipping
on
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
let
it
sit
for
a
while
this
is
a
tasty
beer
rich
and
full
of
flavour
pretty
sweet
like
a
brandy
liqueur
a
really
brilliant
example
of
the
style
and
the
time
on
oak
really
brings
this
to
life
pours
sort
of
a
hazy
burnt
caramel
color
and
boasts
a
nice
lathery
off
white
head
with
outstanding
retention
it
smells
extremely
sweet
molasses
and
cane
sugar
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
smells
a
lot
like
en
english
barleywine
actually
with
a
similar
malt
profile
the
flavor
though
is
what
makes
this
special
while
it
is
intensely
sweet
there
is
a
lot
more
to
it
there
is
some
bready
malt
that
reminds
me
of
teacakes
there
is
a
butterscotch
character
that
coupled
with
the
oak
is
simply
sensational
and
the
alcohol
while
strong
is
also
sort
of
inviting
its
warming
and
friendly
easy
up
easy
down
and
thats
hard
to
accomplish
i
think
very
woody
in
the
finish
and
again
very
sweet
relaxed
carbonation
is
ample
and
the
body
is
colossal
its
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
thats
for
sure
but
its
a
heck
of
a
beer
really
well
built
and
guilty
of
getting
me
pleasantly
drunker
than
i
anticipated
founders
always
rocks
and
this
old
ale
is
true
to
form
b
to
a
depending
on
who
is
drinking
it
very
satisfying
ale
bet
this
would
be
great
with
a
little
age
on
it
to
tame
the
alcohol
and
the
sugars
overall
a
very
smooth
old
ale
thats
drinks
really
easy
and
seems
totally
appropriate
for
winter
like
spring
in
new
england
quite
a
malt
bomb
i
wasnt
expecting
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
old
stock
ale
should
age
nicely
overall
this
one
is
another
good
offering
from
founders
you
never
know
what
to
expect
from
old
ales
as
they
are
all
so
different
but
this
one
is
a
winner
poured
into
a
16
oz
snifter
bottled
on
21513
pours
a
beautiful
deep
amber
with
a
two
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
webs
of
lace
smell
is
vanilla
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
bready
and
apple
taste
is
all
of
that
with
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
starting
the
party
with
some
figgy
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
large
nice
amount
of
carbonation
maybe
s
little
dry
and
nice
drinkability
i
am
more
of
hop
forward
drinker
but
this
is
really
solid
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
orange
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
wisps
of
foam
on
the
surface
the
aroma
is
sugary
and
malty
with
a
clear
bit
of
ethanol
brown
and
caramelized
sugars
among
dark
pitted
fruit
and
a
solid
hit
of
alcohol
with
little
to
no
hop
nose
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
the
rich
dark
sugars
that
were
present
in
the
nose
added
bonus
is
rich
milk
chocolate
melded
with
dark
fruits
and
again
tempered
with
a
hit
of
ethanol
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
good
beer
i
could
drink
it
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
founders
this
one
didnt
wow
me
overall
a
great
beer
taste
good
fresh
but
improves
with
age
a
good
one
to
find
on
the
shelves
every
year
and
to
buy
a
few
and
drink
what
you
can
and
cellar
the
rest
a
solid
old
ale
example
but
could
be
a
little
more
complex
with
the
scotch
flavors
would
also
have
liked
a
little
bit
more
body
and
to
taste
the
booze
a
little
bit
overall
in
michigan
founders
is
extremely
common
and
the
grand
rapids
brewery
essentially
shares
the
michigan
crown
with
bells
out
of
kalamazoo
i
will
seek
curm
out
in
the
future
i
was
impressed
by
the
taste
considering
my
enjoyment
of
fat
tire
and
other
oakey
beers
look
out
for
this
beer
and
please
pick
it
up
if
you
have
the
opportunity
overall
holy
crap
what
a
great
beer
founders
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
especially
as
of
late
this
beer
proves
again
why
i
freakin
love
this
brewery
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
you
need
to
run
out
and
buy
right
now
but
i
woud
recommend
giving
it
a
try
while
it
is
out
this
beer
isnt
as
good
as
most
of
founders
yearlong
lineup
but
it
is
unique
and
worth
a
try
give
this
a
shot
next
chance
you
get
i
liked
it
i
will
continue
to
by
a
couple
of
4
packs
every
year
it
may
not
be
the
most
flashy
beer
out
there
but
it
is
damn
good
none
the
less
othis
is
just
a
nice
beer
on
a
cold
day
it
is
what
it
is
not
my
style
but
would
like
this
to
just
sip
on
in
front
of
the
fireplace
will
come
back
to
this
beer
for
more
in
depth
review
taste
starts
out
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
hops
are
fairly
muted
but
not
entirely
absent
bit
of
a
bitter
musty
aftertaste
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
which
is
surprising
considering
its
a
fresh
batch
and
not
aged
good
body
with
a
creamy
finish
very
surprising
lots
of
toffee
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
both
in
the
nose
and
taste
hints
of
dried
fruit
as
well
raisins
and
fig
appearance
is
deep
brown
to
red
in
color
with
a
thin
head
that
settles
slowly
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
but
is
present
in
the
flavor
smooth
mouthfeel
could
drink
this
all
day
if
the
abv
was
lower
o
overall
curmudgeon
a
enjoyable
beer
as
the
beer
warms
up
alot
more
complexities
can
be
found
throughout
and
i
am
going
to
assume
and
find
out
that
it
will
open
up
alot
more
with
some
age
its
aggressively
on
the
sweet
side
so
ill
let
a
few
of
these
sit
in
the
cellar
and
mellow
out
notes
damn
this
is
like
backwoods
dirty
bastard
only
better
a
tasty
sipper
bursting
with
flavor
and
aroma
awesome
o
not
one
of
founders
better
efforts
overall
a
good
ale
but
not
my
fave
from
founders
overall
its
a
really
good
old
ale
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
on
draft
but
there
are
other
favorites
out
there
i
prefere
more
reddish
brown
unfiltered
with
a
light
cream
cap
light
lace
and
almost
no
retention
nose
of
syrup
candy
caramel
sweet
dark
fruits
and
fantastic
bready
malt
notes
palate
more
syrup
honey
breads
light
toastiness
slight
booze
and
caramel
again
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
coating
a
fantastic
beer
all
around
id
revisit
this
time
and
time
again
o
sip
this
like
you
would
brandy
its
sweet
heavy
and
complicated
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
complex
and
very
well
integrated
and
balance
very
easy
to
drink
glad
i
have
one
more
thanks
again
jay
overall
this
is
a
nice
smooth
beer
from
founders
i
bet
its
awesome
with
some
time
on
it
o
a
very
nice
old
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
on
the
same
level
as
bells
third
coast
old
ale
really
good
stuff
o
an
interesting
beer
and
my
first
old
ale
great
show
for
the
style
nice
flavor
and
aroma
profile
the
alcohol
isnt
harsh
but
shows
through
enough
to
warn
you
that
this
beer
means
business
a
great
beer
to
sip
through
the
night
o
a
real
sipper
here
to
enjoy
it
ya
got
to
take
it
slow
or
that
high
abv
will
put
ya
down
quick
this
is
not
a
first
beer
or
the
night
beer
definitely
last
one
of
the
night
to
enjoy
it
really
picking
up
on
the
molasses
in
it
too
i
put
couple
of
these
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
happens
they
are
already
9
months
old
so
not
sure
how
much
longer
to
keep
them
or
that
i
can
wait
appearance
was
a
very
hazy
dark
orange
no
appreciable
head
and
what
there
was
vanished
quickly
aroma
was
sweet
slight
alcohol
raisin
date
fruit
notes
some
breadiness
some
caramel
whiff
of
vanilla
immediate
taste
was
bitterness
with
some
acidity
underneath
then
sweetness
malty
caramel
maybe
fig
sweet
grapes
maple
syrup
notes
and
more
vanilla
than
the
nose
sweetness
builds
vanilla
and
maple
notes
linger
soft
and
smooth
on
the
palate
not
too
carbonated
some
tingle
from
the
alcohol
some
syrupy
sticky
sweetness
stays
on
overall
warming
and
fun
to
drink
a
lot
going
on
but
seems
well
blended
as
it
warmed
cleared
and
had
many
tiny
bubbles
also
became
very
brandy
like
in
character
liking
this
a
lot
this
was
my
first
beer
from
founders
and
i
am
impressed
i
will
be
purchasing
more
from
them
now
that
the
state
line
liquor
store
in
missouri
is
carrying
founders
overall
the
best
old
ale
that
ive
tried
its
an
underapprecited
and
under
brewed
class
of
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
perhaps
the
top
of
the
class
when
it
comes
to
old
ales
and
definitely
worth
having
around
when
you
want
a
break
for
a
hoppy
beer
a
beer
that
does
not
give
bang
for
the
buck
overpriced
single
o
very
good
beer
overall
tons
of
different
flavors
going
on
and
they
all
work
together
well
slightly
hazed
burnt
orange
color
with
a
low
dark
beige
frothy
head
that
settles
quickly
rich
aroma
of
caramel
ripe
fruit
citrus
vanilla
and
cotton
candy
rich
flavor
that
mirrors
the
nose
some
alcohol
sweetness
and
warmth
bourbonesque
notes
rich
caramel
hints
of
smoke
stone
fruits
and
cotton
candy
semifull
mouthfeel
slight
warming
of
the
cheeks
great
beer
o
a
decent
old
ale
a
nice
sipper
but
not
my
favorite
style
definitely
worth
a
try
relax
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
evening
overall
this
was
so
much
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
in
the
meantime
founders
is
simultaneously
laughing
and
making
better
beer
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
depth
from
a
vintage
version
of
thismaybe
i
need
to
have
it
fresher
not
bad
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
brew
its
a
super
smooth
highly
drinkable
complex
old
ale
as
always
founders
really
nailed
this
one
o
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
founders
in
yet
i
still
enjoy
it
i
just
wish
it
was
slightly
less
boozy
in
the
aftertaste
i
will
age
some
more
of
this
for
another
year
and
see
if
the
alcohol
dies
off
could
be
an
awesome
beer
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
we
shall
see
cheers
this
label
is
an
example
of
how
founders
artwork
elevates
beer
more
importantly
scowl
aside
the
label
reminds
me
of
george
this
is
a
nice
malty
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
the
malts
are
very
nicely
balanced
and
the
bitterness
is
more
like
a
coffeelike
bitterness
rather
than
hoplike
my
only
disappointment
is
that
the
sweetness
from
the
nose
didnt
follow
in
the
taste
honestly
thats
only
because
i
have
a
fondness
for
cake
batter
sweetness
in
beers
ultimately
this
is
an
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
its
well
worth
a
try
o
another
great
seasonal
beer
from
founders
a
good
cellar
beer
to
stock
up
and
age
if
you
have
the
patience
this
beer
is
close
to
being
really
good
but
its
lacking
the
punch
the
depth
the
pronounced
flavors
that
i
was
hoping
for
not
bad
but
for
a
big
malty
beer
which
i
tend
to
love
it
didnt
wow
me
curmudgeon
old
ale
pours
an
opaque
amber
with
some
scattered
straight
orange
highlights
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
bone
colored
foam
caps
the
beer
head
retention
is
alright
and
theres
just
a
little
lacing
left
behind
caramel
oak
and
biscuity
aromas
all
leap
out
of
the
glass
towards
my
nose
with
none
dominating
above
the
others
theres
a
prominent
note
of
very
caramelized
brown
sugar
in
the
flavor
profile
waves
of
toffee
toasty
bread
vanilla
and
oak
fall
in
to
create
a
very
layered
flavor
profile
the
body
is
full
though
not
quite
chewy
and
well
short
of
cloying
the
carbonation
is
on
the
muted
side
completing
the
picture
for
a
solid
malt
forward
mouthfeel
curmudgeon
is
just
another
entry
in
founders
impressive
stable
of
malt
forwars
beers
o
great
beer
for
the
cooler
days
o
this
is
a
very
good
old
ale
style
beer
it
is
bold
and
smooth
the
sweet
malt
and
roasted
grain
flavor
was
very
strong
and
soften
just
enough
by
the
mild
hops
this
is
a
good
basic
straightforward
old
ale
and
it
is
this
bold
simplicity
that
makes
this
beer
so
appealing
to
a
fan
of
the
old
ale
style
also
for
almost
10
abv
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
it
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
so
be
careful
and
enjoy
this
beer
was
pretty
good
not
much
on
the
nose
but
really
quite
a
complex
flavor
profile
ranging
from
warm
to
sweet
to
spicy
to
bitter
not
something
id
drink
more
than
one
of
but
definitely
worthy
of
trying
o
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
unique
pretty
odd
but
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
and
delve
into
some
of
those
funky
notes
overall
i
was
expecting
something
maybe
closer
to
a
toned
down
barley
wine
based
on
the
wyeast
descriptions
of
o
i
like
it
and
i
will
buy
it
again
this
one
is
a
sipper
and
it
tastes
better
as
the
beer
warms
maybe
thats
just
the
9
8
alcohol
affecting
my
judgement
i
would
suggest
pairing
this
with
a
rum
cake
or
maybe
a
raisin
or
maple
pudding
would
work
also
overall
more
of
a
weeheavy
than
a
old
ale
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
and
the
mouthfeel
needs
a
little
boost
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
aftertaste
is
the
highlight
for
me
not
sure
id
have
again
with
all
of
the
great
beers
out
there
to
choose
from
o
i
drainpour
this
every
time
but
its
a
wellmade
beer
that
just
doesnt
fit
my
palate
worth
trying
as
it
is
a
good
overall
experience
and
if
you
dont
have
the
same
reaction
to
the
taste
i
suspect
you
would
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
alas
i
can
only
actually
score
it
based
on
my
own
taste
but
i
think
most
people
would
not
have
the
same
reaction
to
the
taste
as
i
do
overall
i
like
it
its
a
nice
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
rather
thick
and
sweet
beer
d
overall
this
was
a
real
treat
for
me
to
my
inexperienced
palate
the
assertive
presence
of
both
malt
and
hops
here
sort
of
reads
as
a
barley
wine
however
i
find
this
more
accessible
and
drinkable
than
most
barley
wines
because
the
hop
presence
and
alcohol
doesnt
become
too
overbearing
this
remains
drinkable
and
very
tasty
throughout
while
i
probably
wouldnt
consider
this
much
of
an
old
ale
by
my
standards
its
certainly
a
unique
beer
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
overall
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
but
a
pretty
good
one
only
detractor
is
the
appearance
with
watching
out
for
snot
and
lots
of
sediment
it
wasnt
the
best
looking
of
brews
either
but
still
good
worth
a
try
and
id
be
curmudgeons
better
half
is
fantastic
after
having
tasted
this
overall
a
tasty
brew
not
too
complex
big
taste
but
it
vanishes
too
soon
all
considered
its
another
fine
brew
from
founders
im
not
sure
this
brew
is
a
proper
representation
of
an
old
ale
but
its
still
quite
good
thank
you
matt
for
the
wonderful
extras
o
this
beer
looks
really
nice
in
my
snifter
and
the
oak
and
vanilla
taste
is
interesting
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
old
ales
but
i
like
this
one
o
excellent
aroma
and
a
great
taste
but
the
booze
creeps
up
fast
and
becomes
a
bit
too
much
some
aging
would
do
wonders
on
this
beer
but
at
a
few
months
old
its
not
terribly
impressive
i
do
prefer
old
stock
to
this
overall
a
very
very
nice
ale
very
drinkable
i
want
to
try
this
again
d
this
one
needs
some
time
the
wet
oak
is
currently
a
little
overpowering
another
great
beer
from
founders
perfect
beer
on
this
cold
rainy
evening
good
old
old
ale
o
my
go
to
old
ale
just
awesome
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
on
any
occasion
o
pretty
good
old
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
but
nor
would
i
seek
one
out
o
tasty
old
ale
good
combination
and
balance
of
flavors
a
little
too
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
not
sure
if
its
hoppy
or
if
its
ashy
hard
to
say
otherwise
very
enjoyable
a
sweet
and
fruity
and
chocolatey
old
ale
well
this
is
the
first
founders
offering
i
just
didnt
like
it
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
about
a
one
finger
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
apples
other
sweet
scents
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
taste
is
sweet
with
lots
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
i
dont
mind
high
gravity
beers
but
i
just
feel
the
alcohol
could
have
been
better
hidden
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
bourbon
sorry
but
i
dont
really
recommend
this
one
pours
a
dark
hazy
amber
with
a
quarter
inch
head
and
fine
lacing
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
left
floating
around
scents
of
rosated
malts
bourbon
vanilla
and
molasses
are
apparent
taste
follows
nose
to
a
t
fantastic
malt
profile
complimented
by
a
creamy
vanilla
and
then
that
firey
bourbon
at
the
back
of
your
mouth
leaving
behind
a
lingering
taste
of
molasses
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
and
a
little
tacky
on
the
tongue
really
a
well
done
brew
another
hit
from
founders
o
this
is
big
on
malt
goodness
personally
i
love
malts
just
as
much
as
hops
you
definitely
have
to
enjoy
sweetness
and
a
load
of
malts
and
some
oaked
character
to
enjoy
this
one
frankly
i
appreciate
this
lovely
old
ale
from
founders
its
a
fantastic
brew
that
requires
the
drinker
to
need
a
change
of
pace
i
respect
the
brewer
for
reminding
me
its
not
only
about
the
hops
and
founders
are
the
worlds
best
at
reminding
us
what
good
beer
is
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
really
a
winter
sipper
but
i
wanted
something
to
make
my
postwork
friday
afternoon
more
enjoyable
mission
accomplished
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
copper
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
caramel
and
bread
crust
the
flavor
leads
with
a
bitter
grapefruit
smack
like
an
ipa
followed
through
with
a
cloying
sticky
sweet
caramel
with
a
medicinal
warmth
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
sickeningly
sweet
founders
curmudgeon
old
ale
is
a
disappointing
beer
not
recommended
very
solid
old
dale
from
founders
comes
off
as
traditional
and
classic
but
with
their
own
spin
on
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
fullers
vintage
ale
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
abv
founders
killin
it
as
always
not
a
homerun
but
a
decent
beer
i
wont
seek
out
again
there
are
too
many
other
beers
out
there
for
the
price
o
pretty
decent
a
little
thin
for
the
abv
with
a
little
too
much
of
a
rummyalcohol
presence
imo
i
feel
like
most
of
the
alcohol
is
not
coming
from
the
malts
o
meh
in
fairness
this
is
not
a
good
late
afternoon
kind
of
beer
but
i
still
found
it
rather
mediocre
despite
that
a
rare
misfire
from
founders
but
its
not
completely
irredeemable
overall
worth
reaching
for
another
but
one
of
those
beers
that
while
it
wont
be
forgotten
as
it
is
far
from
average
lacks
some
of
the
balance
of
founders
other
august
beers
pours
a
murky
burnt
orange
with
minimal
off
white
head
carbonation
streams
off
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
of
rich
dark
fruits
up
front
plums
sweet
cherries
followed
by
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
notes
rich
caramel
flavors
up
front
give
way
to
burnt
oak
and
bourbon
on
the
middle
of
the
palate
finishes
sweet
while
i
dont
actively
seek
out
old
ales
founders
does
a
good
job
with
this
one
worth
a
try
12oz
bottle
with
bottled
041912
on
the
neck
pours
a
rusty
brown
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
some
lacing
aromas
of
booze
cherries
vanilla
and
oak
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
boozey
oak
up
front
with
the
cherries
and
vanilla
some
malts
and
breadiness
boozey
oaky
finish
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
solid
old
ale
with
nice
oak
flavors
to
it
well
made
edit
i
just
had
a
2
year
aged
and
this
brew
is
completely
different
it
is
actually
fitting
for
the
holidays
as
it
has
some
holiday
spice
to
the
profile
the
booze
is
completely
gone
and
really
drinks
well
i
dont
know
that
it
is
improving
much
but
more
just
muting
itself
this
was
an
instant
favorite
almost
like
a
cognac
heavy
vanilla
and
alcohol
flavor
but
theres
more
depth
than
that
a
bit
of
oak
and
cinnamon
for
instance
linger
somewhere
in
there
the
bar
served
it
in
a
rocks
glass
which
was
disappointing
as
a
snifter
would
have
been
perfect
for
this
ale
i
got
plenty
of
enjoyment
in
the
smell
as
it
was
but
a
snifter
likely
would
have
made
it
even
better
i
really
have
to
look
into
more
old
ales
because
if
they
are
anything
like
curmudgeon
its
a
style
perfectly
tailored
to
my
tastes
overall
really
great
not
surprised
that
better
half
came
out
so
well
with
this
base
would
love
to
see
what
regular
bourbon
barrel
aging
would
do
to
this
o
i
really
like
this
beer
though
i
want
to
see
what
a
couple
of
years
will
do
to
mellow
some
of
the
spicing
and
molasses
flavors
another
winner
from
founders
like
i
expected
anything
else
im
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
review
this
since
im
a
huge
founders
fan
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
a
change
of
pace
and
it
will
be
in
my
fridge
in
years
to
come
ill
let
one
age
but
i
have
a
feeling
this
one
is
better
fresh
as
the
sweetness
may
intensify
two
finger
offwhite
head
dissipates
over
several
minutes
to
a
very
fine
layer
and
bubbles
relegated
to
the
ring
around
the
glass
whats
there
is
a
bit
fluffy
but
minimal
redcopper
coloring
with
floating
particles
smell
is
delicious
vanilla
molasses
malt
and
hints
of
the
oak
in
which
it
was
aged
love
the
smell
taste
follows
the
nose
very
similarly
except
for
sweetness
its
very
sweet
and
for
me
not
particularly
drinkable
meaning
i
dont
think
i
can
drink
this
every
day
vanilla
is
prominent
with
malt
and
molasses
the
sweetness
somewhat
masks
the
oak
mouthfeel
is
smooth
syrupy
medium
bodied
with
some
carbonation
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
vanilla
over
i
really
like
this
beer
it
gets
better
with
age
i
look
forward
to
tasting
my
2011
vintage
later
this
fall
when
it
has
1820
months
on
it
overall
great
example
of
an
old
ale
and
it
gets
better
after
warming
up
for
a
few
minutes
cloudy
copper
raisins
and
malty
yeast
aroma
so
nice
and
comforting
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
making
it
a
unique
ale
rich
and
complex
boozy
in
the
middle
dried
cherriesraisintouch
of
vanillabourbon
finishes
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
o
a
very
decent
beer
a
little
onedimensional
in
my
humble
opinion
while
there
are
different
subtle
flavors
and
aromas
i
feel
as
if
this
beer
definitely
plays
on
the
malts
alone
i
love
founders
beers
but
this
one
seems
slightly
under
their
other
superb
offerings
in
their
lineup
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
so
perhaps
ill
grow
to
like
this
one
more
with
subsequent
tastings
overall
the
malt
profile
is
excellent
and
adds
a
lot
to
the
mouthfeel
its
a
little
sweet
for
how
i
like
this
style
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
overall
this
is
a
tasty
old
ale
but
after
you
have
drank
adam
its
really
hard
to
find
a
better
tasting
old
ale
d
very
drinkable
good
malty
old
ale
with
a
great
balance
of
flavors
and
good
mouthfeel
and
body
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
notes
as
well
as
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
the
caramel
malt
is
pretty
strong
and
provides
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
it
is
accompanied
by
some
dark
fruit
and
dark
cherry
notes
as
well
as
some
tobacco
and
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
definitely
a
solid
offering
from
founders
its
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
but
then
again
every
beer
cant
be
from
one
brewery
odi
found
this
to
be
a
solid
offering
from
founders
but
it
is
probably
in
the
lower
tier
of
their
brews
quite
nice
but
fails
to
truly
distinguish
itself
and
leave
a
legacy
in
my
mind
the
better
half
version
of
this
beer
is
a
giant
improvement
still
this
is
a
cool
singe
to
try
but
doesnt
warrant
a
1516
dollar
fourpack
price
tag
o
another
solid
brew
from
founders
they
dont
brew
bad
beers
based
on
all
the
ones
i
have
tried
so
far
anyway
o
very
good
brew
that
sneaks
some
interesting
favors
into
the
beginning
and
the
end
o
decent
offering
from
founders
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
with
some
age
on
it
in
the
future
in
hopes
that
the
aging
will
bring
out
more
flavors
and
limit
the
beers
heat
a
bit
in
its
young
state
it
does
seem
that
this
beer
is
more
balanced
than
a
number
of
other
old
ales
which
become
cloying
quickly
full
body
and
light
carbonation
this
beer
feels
sticky
when
drinking
it
syrupy
almost
overall
it
has
its
shortcomings
mostly
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
well
makes
up
for
it
o
an
enjoyable
complex
brew
from
founders
lots
of
flavors
here
and
they
all
work
together
well
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
and
relax
with
o
this
is
a
nice
old
ale
definitely
not
as
good
or
flavorful
as
the
better
half
but
good
for
much
more
attainable
brew
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
however
i
definitely
think
it
could
use
more
flavor
like
the
better
half
definitely
a
good
founders
offering
but
not
their
best
at
16
for
a
4pack
i
dont
see
myself
buying
much
more
of
this
due
to
the
expense
but
i
recommend
at
least
trying
it
o
this
beer
was
delicious
and
an
awesome
example
of
an
old
ale
it
tastes
and
smells
great
with
a
variety
of
malt
and
dark
fruity
ester
aromas
and
flavors
the
molasses
and
oakaging
really
add
a
lot
of
flavors
aromas
and
character
to
this
beer
in
my
opinion
another
great
offering
from
founders
i
enjoyed
this
beer
im
not
as
familiar
with
the
style
but
enjoyed
curmudgeon
enough
to
explore
the
style
more
thoroughly
i
have
one
more
2011
left
that
ill
be
holding
on
to
till
next
year
o
solid
old
ale
nothing
thats
going
to
knock
your
sox
off
but
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
well
done
a
really
good
old
ale
high
abv
easy
to
drink
complex
smell
and
flavor
hard
to
say
anything
but
this
is
a
very
high
quality
beer
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
is
deep
amber
in
color
looks
syrupy
as
it
is
being
poured
has
tall
frothy
head
that
holds
excellent
retention
and
leaves
tons
of
sticky
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
impressive
aromas
are
sticky
sweet
with
toffee
vanilla
oak
honey
and
biscuit
tastes
are
bold
and
sweet
cloyingly
at
times
notes
of
vanilla
oak
toffee
caramel
are
all
present
with
it
being
rather
boozy
especially
as
it
warms
finishes
with
a
peppery
prickle
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
overall
i
loved
coming
back
to
this
one
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
much
for
the
last
4
or
so
ounces
excellent
founders
quality
as
usual
though
overall
very
smooth
complex
and
highly
drinkable
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
to
me
its
like
a
relaxing
beer
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
to
unwind
originally
reviewed

o
overall
it
is
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
to
enjoy
while
relaxing
or
before
going
to
bed
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
beer
was
poured
very
carefully
so
there
was
very
little
head
the
aroma
was
mild
with
notes
of
vanilla
oak
barrel
and
vanilla
flavors
are
accentuated
by
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
mild
pleasant
drinkable
beer
despite
its
higher
abv
this
is
a
malt
bomb
malty
bready
chewy
in
the
mouthfeel
notes
of
toffee
caramel
scotch
some
sharp
dry
alcohol
esters
in
the
back
that
are
a
little
harsh
this
is
fresh
and
it
is
good
im
thinking
with
some
age
to
soften
the
rough
edges
it
will
be
amazing
o
another
score
for
founders
i
tend
to
feel
like
they
get
the
styles
just
right

this
is
the

better
than

much

i

got
a
funky
bottle
the
first
time
beers
the
12
goes
down
much
easier
than
its
elder
it
really
is
an
entirely
different
beer
i
was
unsure
if
i
would
be
too
interested
in
the
differences
between
these
two
but
alas
all
in
all
id
recommend
the
fresh
curmudgeon
over
an
aged
version
9
times
out
of
10
overall
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
will
love
to
come
back
to
soon
many
interesting
notes
going
on
that
i
love
age
on
the
bottle
has
only
made
things
even
more
smooth
the
flavors
have
melded
together
quite
well
as
i
mentioned
a
year
ago
the
flavor
begins
smoothly
then
intensifies
to
a
wonderful
hoppy
bite
im
picking
up
on
a
little
coffee
as
well
carbonation
is
still
on
the
low
side
but
who
is
complaining
probably
the
old
curmudgeon
d
flavor
and
the
nose
are
good
not
great
a
little
too
much
booze
on
this
less
than
a
month
old
example
i
will
certainly
consider
setting
a
few
of
these
aside
for
a
while
and
im
sure
that
would
make
them
that
much
better

o
really
like
curmudgeon
this
is
probably
a
better
beer
when
fresh
i
think
but
it
would
be
fun
to
do
a
side
by
side
very
excited
to
get
to
my
better
half
when
the
time
is
right
i
could
only
imagine
how
this
beer
would
come
out
from
the
barrel
oat
a
year
old
it
seems
to
be
past
its
prime
lots
of
malt
and
not
much
else
overall
it
is
a
phenomenal
blend
of
savory
flavors
o
i
havent
had
many
old
ales
but
the
ones
i
have
have
generally
been
a
bit
fruitier
and
sweeter
this
is
more
refined
and
subtle
a
tasty
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
want
a
whole
lot
of
this
good
but
not
particularly
memorable
overall
an
outstanding
old
ale
good
complexity
taste
and
just
a
good
beer
well
done
by
founders
overall
quite
delicious
beer
its
an
ugly
beer
but
delicious
o
certainly
a
nice
treat
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
vintage
floating
around
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
full
bodied
and
full
flavor
silky
smooth
and
a
good
balance
of
flavors
no
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
but
a
slight
bitter
feel
in
the
finish
might
be
slightly
under
carbonated
due
to
the
age
but
this
guy
is
3
years
old
so
id
say
its
held
up
quite
nice
for
the
age
drinks
well
a
nice
sipper
alcohol
doesnt
doesnt
burn
or
anything
either
well
hidden
for
a
brew
thats
almost
10
overall
another
great
beer
from
founders
i
wish
the
sweet
aspect
of
this
beer
packed
more
of
a
punch
on
the
palate
more
raisin
and
dates
i
think
even
a
little
vanilla
would
take
this
one
a
long
way
the
fantastic
slightly
roasty
and
bready
base
could
be
built
on
overall
a
great
old
ale
but
ive
come
to
expect
more
from
founder
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
so
i
had
a
year
old
keg
at
a
tap
takeover
but
ive
got
fresh
bottles
and
i
couldnt
resist
pour
is
like
a
good
barleywinebright
orange
with
no
head
ok
now
this
is
the
biggest
compliment
ever
it
reminds
of
regulator
doppelbock
at
bull
city
burger
and
brewery
grassy
earthy
malt
dominates
like
crazy
feels
crisp
but
in
an
insanely
good
way
maybe
its
the
style
but
its
unique
for
sure
very
earthy
malt
hints
of
caramel
and
a
nice
bit
of
scotch
barrel
very
smooth
caramel
and
syrupy
notes
color
is
a
ruddy
burnt
umber
with
light
flecks
floating
about
seems
to
be
some
carbonation
a
peach
colored
head
initially
appears
to
be
about
14
but
dissipates
shortly
thereafter
aroma
is
sweet
with
figs
toffee
molasses
bittersweet
chocolate
and
grainy
malt
apparent
the
body
is
full
and
rich
with
a
winelike
acidity
the
first
hint
of
the
flavor
is
like
dessert
of
some
kind
before
the
hops
kick
in
warms
nicely
without
being
too
astringent
overall
a
great
balance
between
sweet
bitter
aspects
would
buy
again
poured
a
slightly
hazy
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
ivory
bubbles
for
a
head
not
much
to
speak
of
in
the
way
of
retention
or
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malts
caramel
molasses
and
dried
candied
fruits
the
taste
reflects
the
aroma
with
flavors
of
sweet
malts
toasty
dark
sugars
fruitcake
tangy
alcohol
warmth
with
a
tinge
of
citrus
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
nice
brew
heavymedium
mouthfeel
lots
of
flavor
easily
drinkable
though
can
be
a
little
on
the
hot
side
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
rich
copperruby
coloring
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbling
in
the
beer
that
doesnt
really
move
around
much
looks
heavy
no
head
but
there
is
a
ring
of
film
around
the
edge
of
the
surface
aromas
are
rich
and
smooth
and
extremely
malty
and
layered
some
rich
dark
fruit
and
earthy
highlights
on
the
nose
also
flavors
are
super
smooth
and
rich
with
a
boozey
roasted
and
old
world
fruit
sweet
in
the
backbone
dates
raisins
and
fig
throughout
the
beer
layer
nicely
with
the
heavier
malt
profiles
of
molasses
earthy
characteristics
rough
the
beer
up
a
bit
and
keep
it
interesting
for
your
tastebuds
a
slight
peppery
hopping
at
the
end
cleans
the
palate
and
prepares
you
to
jump
back
in
to
the
brew
the
aftertaste
is
rich
and
slightly
cloying
but
pleasantly
so
this
one
keeps
stringing
you
along
for
more
the
finish
is
rich
and
smooth
with
a
surprising
cleanness
at
the
end
very
tasty
and
not
overpowering
despite
the
strong
flavor
profiles
and
increased
abv
into
a
tulip
glass
settles
a
reddish
deep
amber
under
a
well
sustained
head
deep
candy
sweet
toasted
malt
busts
through
in
the
nose
with
a
hefty
blend
of
syrupy
cherries
mild
citrus
and
caramel
enjoyed
at
a
cool
temperature
the
flavors
here
take
on
a
rich
well
pronounced
and
warming
character
that
reminds
me
of
a
post
meal
cordial
a
powdery
dry
and
complex
flavored
finish
echoes
the
blend
of
boozy
fruit
caramel
and
cocoa
that
just
waltzed
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
gulden
draak
too
syrupy
but
its
a
little
more
carbonated
definitely
an
interesting
one
to
try
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
it
might
do
better
with
a
bit
more
age
but
it
tastes
pretty
good
and
has
a
lot
going
on
o
founders
curmudgeon
isnt
quite
the
beer
i
remember
when
fresh
when
i
feel
it
drinks
a
bit
better
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
as
there
are
better
instyle
that
id
recommend
before
this
an
above
average
offering
in
general
though
its
a
middle
of
the
road
entry
in
founders
world
class
portfolio
poured
into
dimpled
mug
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
very
little
head
retention
smells
clean
light
citrus
scent
very
complex
mix
of
sweet
dark
fruits
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
aforementioned
smells
with
the
9
8
abv
adding
a
nice
warming
presence
to
the
very
nice
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
a
velvety
burn
on
the
finish
but
very
good
very
drinkable
even
for
a
sipper
another
solid
founders
beer
that
i
will
happily
purchase
more
of
in
the
future
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
old
ales
ive
yet
to
have
o
good
stuff
really
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
more
this
year
to
try
it
fresh
and
as
it
ages
overall
not
too
shabby
for
being
bottled
on
4911
could
only
imagine
how
much
more
mellowed
out
this
beer
could
get
if
it
were
aged
properly
still
very
delicious
and
now
i
will
look
out
for
his
better
half
overall
another
great
beer
from
founders
this
is
a
remarkably
enjoyable
englishstyle
old
ale
and
a
great
warming
winter
brew
still
another
swell
drink
from
founders
though
poured
this
into
a
unibroue
tulip
appearance
is
dark
red
with
a
short
offwhite
head
its
nose
contains
vanilla
toffee
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
has
caramel
brown
sugar
more
dark
fruit
booze
comes
through
in
taste
as
well
as
some
bitterness
mf
is
crisp
nice
as
it
warms
up
goes
down
fairly
easy
all
things
considered
this
is
a
damn
good
old
ale
i
was
glad
to
see
this
again
as
the
temperatures
dropped
in
2011
the
transition
from
the
slow
start
to
the
strong
finish
both
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
doesnt
feel
connected
but
instead
like
two
different
drinks
its
nice
but
im
letting
the
other
bottles
sit
for
a
few
months
odelicious
founders
brew
that
i
very
much
enjoyed
as
a
nightcap
the
boozy
nature
of
this
beer
is
appealing
while
it
sneers
at
you
as
a
curmudgeon
would
d
what
youd
expect
from
founders
a
very
good
beer
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
quite
drinkable
closer
to
dirty
bastard
than
backwoods
bastard
sadly
and
not
up
to
the
expectations
curmudgeon
from
a
bottle
is
a
pretty
deep
red
amber
color
but
light
thin
head
and
little
lacing
which
all
goes
away
pretty
quick
smells
very
sweet
smell
is
sweet
honey
caramel
with
some
heat
tingling
the
nose
hairs
very
sweet
taste
honey
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
traces
of
cream
caramel
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
fruit
quite
complex
sweetness
is
followed
by
booze
for
a
hot
finish
very
interesting
overall
flavor
mouthfeel
is
warm
and
heavy
creamyboozy
low
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
not
something
i
would
get
on
the
regular
but
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
curmudgeon
is
somewhere
between
old
ale
and
barleywine
and
although
it
is
drinkable
the
nearly
10abv
is
unsurprising
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
layers
of
interesting
flavors
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
founders
o
this
is
definitely
a
wellcrafted
beer
and
probably
a
musttry
of
you
like
old
ales
to
me
the
matly
sugary
buttery
notes
were
too
overwhelming
7282011
do
really
more
interesting
than
good
this
old
ale
seems
to
ooze
authenticity
while
no
part
of
it
qualifies
as
offensive
there
is
a
discordant
note
than
is
struck
early
on
in
the
taste
by
a
precocious
bitterness
that
is
awkwardly
fresh
in
its
plantlike
way
then
on
its
heels
is
a
similarly
lively
acidity
taken
together
these
two
elements
have
the
effect
of
splitting
the
flavor
profile
into
asymmetrical
halves
deeper
on
things
seem
to
normalize
with
a
remarkable
complexity
coming
on
by
the
finish
overall
a
very
nice
old
ale
from
an
amazing
brewery
i
have
yet
to
be
let
down
from
founders
this
particular
bottle
had
some
age
on
i
would
like
to
try
one
fresh
to
compare
it
was
really
smooth
lots
of
flavor
and
a
perfect
beer
for
a
nice
cold
night
drink
i
really
enjoy
old
ales
and
this
was
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
i
like
the
vanilla
notes
that
were
prevalant
in
this
one
would
love
to
age
some
of
these
o
i
am
really
on
the
fence
with
this
one
i
loved
the
way
it
looked
and
smelled
but
the
flavor
fell
a
little
short
for
me
cant
say
anything
bad
about
the
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
cheers
overall
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
however
if
you
havent
tried
it
before
then
dont
pass
it
up
this
is
another
one
that
was
just
consistent
in
all
the
five
categories
think
old
curmudgeon
and
delicious
founders
as
always
really
nailed
it
with
this
one
the
name
and
the
five
senses
really
matched
up
smell
of
biscuit
must
leather
sweat
from
the
collar
taste
is
just
fantastic
very
little
sweetness
that
i
prefer
but
makes
up
for
it
with
tangy
woody
bourbonlike
feel
not
a
heavy
mouth
solid
but
not
heavy
at
all
for
me
i
didnt
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
although
the
9
8
indication
made
me
hesitate
to
drink
this
at
5pm
try
it
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
smooth
drinks
ive
had
yet
the
blending
was
done
very
tastefully
i
prefer
it
fresh
due
to
the
more
noticeable
hop
presence
but
its
still
a
treat
aged
overall
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
not
quite
as
refined
as
it
could
have
been
but
still
a
delicious
mix
of
booze
carmelly
malt
and
hoppy
bitterness
recommended
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
without
much
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
and
pretty
sweet
smelling
actually
there
was
also
some
boozy
aromas
that
flooded
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
and
lightly
roasted
lots
of
caramel
flavors
and
some
fresh
wood
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
feel
it
gets
better
with
some
age
to
it
either
way
its
another
good
brew
from
founders
o
well
there
is
a
reason
founders
is
who
they
are
curmudgeon
is
an
unbelievable
brew
again
it
is
so
smooth
and
lively
with
flavor
that
you
almost
feel
like
you
are
drinking
a
rich
amber
ale
unbelievable
overall
perfect
warmerupper
for
a
cold
fallwinter
day
incredibly
smooth
beer
for
nearly
10
rich
in
flavor
and
a
really
nice
sipper
of
a
beer
im
going
to
save
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
it
matures
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
not
a
bad
brew
lots
more
noticeable
alcohol
than
i
anticipated
o
a
nice
beer
but
the
carbonation
is
just
a
touch
high
and
hurts
the
beer
really
a
huge
beer
and
the
dryness
and
oak
really
help
lighten
it
up
and
make
it
enjoyable
knock
back
the
carbonation
just
a
touch
and
it
would
really
be
a
winner
for
me
regardless
another
fine
beer
from
founders
overall
not
a
beginners
brew
this
is
definitely
a
cult
beer
but
old
ales
generally
are
a
cult
style
this
is
one
worth
seeking
out
but
you
must
prepare
yourself
for
it
a
little
age
does
this
one
better
justice
100
absolutely
mastercraft
but
this
beer
is
huge
overall
smelling
this
beer
might
mess
up
your
initial
judgement
but
this
beer
makes
up
for
it
in
every
other
category
it
is
your
wee
heavy
type
of
beer
little
sweet
but
great
blend
and
balance
of
flavor
o
decent
nothing
spectactular
very
solid
excellent
beer
ive
had
this
before
but
usually
fresh
and
this
is
notably
smoother
and
richer
after
only
one
year
great
offering
from
founders
only
lacking
in
that
it
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
giants
of
the
style
but
still
well
worth
seeking
out
o
interesting
beer
i
like
it
but
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
its
very
sweet
though
not
in
a
sickening
way
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
founders
it
is
much
more
complex
that
i
can
put
into
words
and
it
is
not
at
all
alcoholic
like
the
other
reviewers
have
said
beautifully
crafted
and
the
quality
is
outstanding
as
always
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
mostly
a
biting
alcoholic
note
that
really
ends
warm
on
the
tongue
makes
my
head
fuzzy
right
away
and
fills
me
with
warm
cheer
great
brew
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
murky
brown
with
some
sediment
and
a
touch
of
light
tan
head
that
left
pretty
quick
perhaps
cracked
this
a
little
too
cold
some
spotty
lacing
and
minimal
retention
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
raisins
carmel
and
burnt
sugar
taste
follows
more
of
the
carmelmolasses
that
is
very
strong
and
a
bit
on
the
boozy
end
picked
up
a
little
fig
note
on
the
end
but
reminded
me
of
burnt
carmel
and
hops
bitterness
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
very
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
heavy
with
a
hint
of
silk
overall
not
my
style
i
guess
was
wanting
the
booziness
to
give
way
to
the
rich
flavors
but
it
was
kind
of
over
the
top
carmel
with
some
hops
on
the
end
not
sure
ill
grab
another
shame
because
i
like
some
other
founders
offerings
overall
curmudgeon
makes
for
a
pleasant
night
cap
but
i
would
probably
buy
hibernation
the
ola
dubh
series
and
north
coast
old
stock
before
grabbing
this
one
again
a
serviceable
old
ale
that
falls
short
of
the
greats
for
me
this
style
is
certainly
hit
or
miss
and
while
i
dont
think
this
was
a
complete
miss
it
wasnt
a
deadon
hit
either
there
are
some
really
nice
complexities
in
the
beer
but
also
some
very
tangent
flavors
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
mastered
balance
in
the
flavor
profile
but
it
still
does
have
qualities
that
make
it
enjoyable
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
caramel
maple
and
pretty
boozy
very
sweet
mouthfeel
thick
and
syrupy
alcohol
is
very
present
not
in
a
bad
way
just
definitely
a
nice
warmingsipping
brew
overall
this
is
really
good
and
enjoyable
o
great
selection
for
a
chilly
night
cant
compare
it
to
other
old
ales
though
enjoying
the
subtle
use
of
hopscontrasts
the
upfront
sweetness
of
the
malt
dthis
is
a
very
nice
and
intriguing
brew
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
as
is
but
now
i
have
to
try
it
fresh
to
compare
abv
is
very
well
hidden
be
careful
overall
id
love
to
be
able
to
get
more
of
this
brew
i
look
forward
to
seeing
founders
in
texas
one
of
these
days
o
this
was
a
really
good
old
ale
not
as
good
as
old
stock
but
still
delicious
nonetheless
the
body
is
heavy
and
sticky
with
soft
carbonation
a
little
bit
coarse
on
the
finish
overall
this
one
is
pretty
outstanding
as
are
most
of
the
founders
line
up
m
medium
to
full
body
chewy
light
carbonation
great
mouth
feel
o
this
is
an
awesome
style
some
of
my
favorite
flavors
in
one
bottle
if
this
particular
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
an
old
ale
i
can
assure
you
that
ill
be
attacking
this
style
with
full
force
cant
wait
for
kaiser
curmudgeon
o
is
it
an
old
ale
or
barleywine
who
cares
it
is
tasty
tasty
stuff
color
is
a
rather
unattractive
orangebrown
and
the
lack
of
any
head
or
lacing
doesnt
help
the
appearance
scents
of
dark
fruits
and
molasses
are
nice
if
a
bit
weak
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
boozy
smell
too
caramel
and
molasses
are
up
front
in
the
taste
with
a
punch
of
booziness
in
the
finish
that
i
dont
find

definitely
some
heat
going

and
down
the

excellent
brew
here
o
this
is
a
decent
old
ale
little
bitter
this
is
a
great
style
for
barrel
aging
and
the
kaiser
curmudgeon
whoa
now
thats
a
beer
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
it
was
surprising
since
i
enjoyed
so
much
founders
in
the
past
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
hopefully
seeing
again
soon
o
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
if
it
were
cheaper
and
actually
available
in
my
state
i
like
it
i
can
tell
this
one
will
get
better
with
age
poured
kinda
hard
due
to
the
fact
i
knew
it
was
an
old
ale
lots
of
chunkies
and
yeast
cake
what
the
hell
off
white
head
deep
aubern
color
floating
yeast
matter
pretty
ugly
except
for
the
uncharicterstic
lacing
aroma
of
malt
forward
english
yeast
sweet
malts
and
specialty
malt
some
cherry
notes
on
the
aroma
but
their
light
flavor
really
malt
forward
some
caramel
wait
no
alot
of
caramel
some
light
molasses
in
addition
some
phenol
like
english
yeast
flavor
is
present
thick
underattenuated
beer
sweet
thick
mouthfeel
and
even
a
little
bitter
on
the
finish
from
some
hops
not
bad
in
the
panthion
of
old
ale
it
isnt
a
victory
but
its
ok
pours
a
nice
brown
with
some
orange
tones
there
is
very
little
head
on
this
beer
at
all
there
is
not
much
of
a
nose
to
this
beer
perhaps
one
can
sense
a
bit
of
caramel
but
that
is
it
the
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
the
flavors
become
deeper
as
the
beer
warms
i
think
that
this
is
a
strong
effort
from
one
of
the
most
consistent
breweries
in
the
u
s
o
a
good
old
ale
that
is
for
sure
a
solid
beer
a
little
hot
and
nothing
to
special
on
this
one
unlike
its
kieser
variation
but
still
a
good
ale
from
a
great
brewery
i
think
the
drinkability
for
me
makes
this
a
food
pairing
beer
or
a
sipper
defiantly
not
a
session
beer
this
is
a
heavy
one
and
defiantly
one
that
you
want
to
sip
and
take
your
time
drinking
though
for
as
heavy
as
it
is
i
thought
it
was
on
the
smooth
side
with
a
pinch
of
carbonation
and
some
stickiness
like
others
have
said
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
and
really
should
be
coming
out
in
the
late
fall
instead
of
the
late
spring
overall
man
i
came
into
this
beer
wanting
to
love
it
and
instead
i
have
rated
it
dramatically
low
if
you
love
a
biscuity
malt
flavor
if
fat
tire
is
your
favorite
beer
ever
if
you
ever
wonder
why
they
make
anything
other
than
victory
malt
then
this
beer
may
be
for
you
it
is
not
however
for
me
o
a
really
interesting
outing
not
sure
if
its
oakaged
but
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
the
grains
predominate
but
theres
enough
going
on
behind
it
to
give
it
a
really
unique
and
flavorful
character
that
is
highly
recommended
d
a
little
too
boozy
for
me
but
there
are
some
redeeming
qualities
worth
a
try
very
nice
as
i
continue
to
explore
sweeter
beers
i
stumbled
across
this
one
perusing
other
reviews
my
focus
has
been
stoutsporters
trying
to
find
best
of
breed
in
this
category
in
my
opinion
this
one
came
to
my
attention
based
upon
reviews
i
read
perhaps
i
just
stumbled
on
a
unique
old
ale
but
this
is
right
up
may
alley
has
all
the
sweetness
i
like
minus
the
hop
bite
of
course
guess
i
need
to
expand
from
stoutsporters
into
a
new
category
depth
of
flavors
really
interesting
i
am
tasting
a
lot
of
sweetness
specifically
cherryvanilla
and
caramel
whopping
alcohol
is
apparent
with
an
astringent
note
minimal
bitterness
aroma
is
boozy
caramel
and
butterscotch
a
little
syrupy
appearance
is
cloudy
and
muddy
like
liquid
clay
not
for
the
novice
ale
drinker
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
but
with
some
age
maybe
the
booze
will
fade
and
the
malt
can
become
more
prevalent
to
create
a
better
balance
probably
my
least
liked
beer
ive
had
from
founders
o
solid
drinkable
beer
its
not
at
all
cloying
about
right
at
about
10
for
a
4
pack
really
easy
drinking
here
other
reviewers
claims
of
strong
biting
booze
dont
hold
true
for
me
completely
delicious
ill
be
buying
another
4pk
to
cellar
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
kind
of
a
barley
wine
meets
the
roasts
of
a
barrel
aged
stout
that
is
a
bit
dramatic
but
not
far
off
thanks
to
davesway10
for
this
extra
this
is
basically
a
somewhat
dulled
version
of
founders
backwoods
bastard
which
itself
is
one
of
the
finest
bourbon
scotch
ales
made
in
the
us
oc
has
most
of
the
same
features
of
bb
heavy
on
the
apricots
and
butterscotch
with
just
enough
oak
to
make
everything
fat
round
and
happy
only
less
by
about
25
but
then
this
is
a
good
deal
sweeter
as
well
if
you
like
founders
dirty
bastard
or
backwoods
bastard
youll
like
old
curmudgeon
for
me
its
a
tad
sweet
but
still
nice
to
be
drinking
as
i
sit
in
a
small
house
on
the
beach
in
truro
ma
watching
hurricane
irene
blow
north
things
could
be
worse
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
slowsipping
beer
this
style
in
general
is
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
i
think
this
is
a
good
representation
for
price
point
though
id
rather
get
a
great
dipa
or
ris
still
if
you
are
looking
to
introduce
yourself
to
the
style
or
are
a
fan
of
the
style
i
would
pick
this
one
up
o
without
looking
through
my
notes
to
be
sure
i
think
this
is
my
first
old
ale
i
will
search
for
more
in
this
style
and
am
glad
i
tried
this
but
personally
this
particular
bottle
is
not
for
me
o
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
pretty
good
but
not
my
favorite
probably
the
first
founders
beer
i
havent
really
liked
overall
i
like
it
it
dances
on
the
edge
of
cloying
cliff
but
never
crosses
the
rim
any
sweeter
and
it
would
have
been
terrible
as
it
is
amazing
d
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
but
it
was
far
from
what
i
was
going
for
in
an
old
ale
the
hops
really
cover
up
most
of
the
complexity
that
it
might
be
able
to
have
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
ages
but
i
dont
know
where
to
get
a
bottle
overall
our
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
was
that
it
tasted
very
much
like
a
dubbel
but
with
a
more
complex
nature
about
the
aroma
the
nose
was
perfectly
balanced
to
allow
for
the
sweet
components
to
shine
through
over
top
of
the
bitter
roasted
malt
presence
where
this
beer
lost
points
was
in
the
over
the
top
sweetness
it
is
not
that
the
sweetness
was
so
offensive
that
it
made
the
beer
undesirable
however
by
the
end
of
the
glass
it
did
prove
a
bit
overwhelming
overall
strongly
in
favor
of
this
beer
not
familiar
with
this
style
but
would
rate
this
as
a
strong
4
o
tasty
beer
and
something
id
like
to
try
again
the
barrel
aged
version
is
probably
fantastic
if
this
is
the
base
beer
since
the
body
can
thin
out
as
it
ages
i
dont
see
this
improving
much
with
cellaring
maybe
the
complex
aromas
in
the
nose
would
impart
into
the
flavor
that
would
be
a
plus
and
mellow
out
that
sensation
of
burnt
malts
i
do
really
like
this
beer
but
not
as
an
old
ale
if
they
didnt
have
old
ale
written
on
the
label
i
would
have
given
a
higher
rating
as
i
would
not
have
reviewed
against
the
style
o
2
5
had
hoped
for
much
more
not
expecting
age
to
work
miracles
but
i
will
wait
and
see
with
the
other
bottles
o
really
great
beer
especially
the
rich
mouthfeel
the
hopmalt
balance
is
near
perfect
the
only
problem
is
i
drank
it
way
too
fast
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
night
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
my
favorite
old
ale
because
the
complexities
in
the
taste
arent
overrun
by
the
hops
or
even
by
the
bitterness
which
founders
can
do
on
certain
brews
top
notch
brew
quite
tasty
but
definitely
a
sipper
overall
still
a
difficult
style
suited
to
a
different
type
of
beer
drinker
overall
a
decent
brew
from
a
great
brewery
this
one
is
a
good
candidate
for
sharing
a
few
ways
i
get
brown
sugar
and
molasses
some
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
plum
and
raisin
fruitiness
no
hops
and
even
the
10
booze
is
very
well
hidden
this
beer
is
drinking
like
nectar
and
i
wish
i
had
more
of
it
to
consume
this
is
a
rich
malty
brew
that
i
am
glad
to
have
sampled
and
would
purchase
again
on
the
spot
highly
recommended
maybe
even
age
for
a
year
this
bottle
is
excellent
this
is
my
second
curmudgeon
and
ive
enjoyed
it
both
times
a
nice
sipping
beer
for
a
nightcap
i
am
going
to
age
a
few
to
see
if
any
additional
flavors
develop
over
time
o
not
bad
but
not
great
especially
at
16
994
pack
pales
in
comparison
to
north
coast
old
stock
old
curmudgeon
is
a
mixed
bag
for
me
looks
good
smells
nice
but
just
kinda
mails
it
in
tastewise
not
sure
if
thats
what
it
should
always
taste
like
but
given
what
other
people
have
said
it
might
be
that
i
had
a
dodgy
bottle
will
have
to
revisit
this
brew
properly
some
other
day
cheers
o
very
unique
taste
quite
enjoyable
has
intense
depth
that
is
surprisingly
not
offputting
cheers
to
illudium
for
the
sample
o
nice
beer
that
gets
nicer
as
it
warms
lots
of
caramelised
malts
balance
the
inherent
funkiness
of
the
style
another
success
from
founders
recommended
o
pretty
weird
but
i
think
i
like
it
takes
a
little
while
to
get
used
to
5
of
9
do
drinkability
is
moderate
i
think
i
will
go
back
to
an
adjective
i
used
earlier
to
sum
up
this
beer
gritty
from
the
oak
to
the
malts
to
the
alcohol
and
even
the
appearance
this
beer
is
not
pretty
its
big
sweet
and
if
youre
not
careful
it
can
put
you
on
your
ass
still
a
nice
beer
that
just
needs
a
little
bit
of
finetuning
o
plenty
of
good
flavors
in
this
one
very
drinkable
old
ale
im
not
used
to
that
m
thick
body
syrupy
to
the
last
sip
mild
carbonation
perfect
amount
for
the
style
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
sticky
an
excellent
blend
of
flavor
sweet
with
a
light
hop
balance
alcohol
actually
adds
to
the
taste
rather
than
detracts
creamy
taste
really
adds
a
nice
dimension
without
distracting
or
overshadowing
other
flavors
aroma
is
good
but
nothing
too
special
like
a
barleywine
it
also
reminds
me
of
old
stock
ale
though
i
may
have
enjoyed
os
a
little
more
a
pretty
solid
alt
not
many
americans
even
do
one
so
props
to
founders
for
that
overall
i
enjoy
the
crap
out
of
this
beer
every
year
and
i
desperately
need
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
another
winner
from
founders
o
probably
the
worst
ive
had
from
founders
ive
had
kbs
and
dirty
bastard
which
were
both
fantastic
so
this
one
must
be
a
hiccup
good
but
not
great
again
can
someone
tell
me
again
the
difference
between
this
and
a
barleywine
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
somebody
here
who
sent
it
to
me
as
an
extra
amber
color
short
head
smells
rich
booze
malt
candy
good
the
flavor
was
nice
old
ale
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
toffee
really
quite
nice
overall
id
buy
this
if
i
could
and
wouldnt
mind
another
bottle
founders
makes
some
quality
beers
overall
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
old
ale
but
not
bad
the
apples
arent
what
i
want
in
an
old
ale
i
want
strong
malts
caramel
and
vanilla
still
i
didnt
seem
to
have
any
difficulty
finding
a
home
for
the
beer
once
it
got
into
the
glass
o
decent
old
ale
but
lacks
that
ridiculous
sweet
alcohol
flavour
that
makes
and
old
ale
distinctive
takes
like
an
old
oxidised
dipa
3
5
my
first
try
at
an
old
ale
and
i
am
sort
of
on
the
fence
about
it
it
doesnt
seem
terribly
balanced
as
the
oak
is
sort
of
overbearing
we
will
see
if
i
like
it
more
as
the
4pack
dwindles
but
presently
there
are
other
founders
brews
i
would
rather
reach
for
overall
this
old
ale
tasted
more
like
a
maltfoward
barleywine
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
good
stuff
and
will
age
nicely
one
hopes
o
pretty
drinkable
for
almost
10
but
maybe
better
enjoyed
slowly
over
the
course
of
the
night
a
damn
fine
example
of
the
style
and
a
perfect
match
for
the
cold
autumn
nights
in
michigan
worth
seeking
out
overall
not
bad
has
a
lot
of
potential
i
like
north
coast
old
stock
better
so
far
but
the
bottles
ive
had
of
that
are
much
older
than
my
bottles
of
curmudgeon
i
will
revisit
this
at
a
later
date
and
rereview
it
overallflavors
came
out
alot
more
as
beer
warmed
its
close
to
room
temp
now
and
im
enjoying
it
more
booze
comes
through
more
but
flavors
are
nicer
have
a
few
more
bottles
that
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
during
the
winter
overall
very
smooth
and
tasty
i
dont
think
founders
can
make
a
bad
beer
othis
was
a
fantastic
brew
it
didnt
taste
much
like
an
old
ale
to
me
though
it
tasted
like
a
perfectly
aged
barleywine
i
would
go
back
to
this
beer
again
if
i
come
across
it
o
very
tasty
old
ale
will
crack
the
three
over
the
next
4
years
o
the
drinkability
here
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
the
flavor
is
very
nice
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
on
the
boozy
side
but
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
i
recommend
trying
it
out
if
you
havent
o
old
curmudgeon
holds
together
its
disparate
elements
quite
well
better
than
my
descriptions
represent
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
bitterness
seems
to
increase
too
becoming
a
more
dominant
player
still
this
beer
is
a
great
sipper
and
is
brewed
for
extensive
cellaring
overall
a
bit
underwhelming
for
a
big
beer
especially
an
old
ale
but
it
does
have
a
great
degree
of
approachability
not
sure
of
the
cellaring
aspect
maybe
ill
save
the
other
two
bottles
out
of
the
four
pack
for
the
winter
solstice
as
this
hit
the
spot
on
the
summer
solstice
a
terribly
cold
wet
rainy
and
windy
day
here
in
the
northland
a
little
disappointed
with
both
the
nose
and
taste
on
this
again
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
an
aged
bottle
of
this
kaiser
curmudgeon
was
absolutely
fantastic
but
pretty
much
any
malty
ale
would
being
aged
in
maple
syrup
barrels
definitely
a
good
beer
to
sip
but
i
suppose
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
one
looking
forward
to
my
future
review
o
very
interesting
here
has
some
of
the
attributes
i
really
enjoy
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
alcohol
hotness
nice
job
i
wouldnt
have
more
then
one
or
two
because
you
do
feel
the
abv
this
is
a
drink
for
those
who
prefer
a
thick
sweet
sipper
low
on
the
totem
pole
for
me
overall
a
good
american
old
ale
nice
flavors
in
this
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
they
develop
over
time
i
didnt
really
like
this
one
too
much
when
fresh
im
glad
everything
has
matured
a
little
bit
cant
wait
for
the
booze
to
die
off
in
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
oak
aged
beer
its
good
but
i
suspect
much
better
once
aged
overall
a
bb
o
an
average
old
ale
a
bit
extreme
on
some
of
the
flavours
caused
some
imbalance
i
would
have
it
again
with
another
year
or
two
on
it
not
bad
average
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
you
try
founders
impresses
me
once
again
which
at
this
point
is
no
surprise
o
really
happy
to
finally
score
a
4pack
of
this
nose
promises
a
much
more
complex
beer
and
i
feel
like
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
even
when
considering
the
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
herbal
hop
character
here
but
all
this
being
said
i
still
think
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
can
imagine
it
will
be
divine
when
the
hops
fall
off
and
with
a
little
oxidation
sweetening
it
up
all
the
more
enjoy
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
definitely
didnt
grab
my
attention
although
its
wellcrafted
i
expected
more
from
founders
average
beer
from
an
above
average
brewery
this
one
is
quite
thick
and
it
burns
its
very
tasty
but
there
is
no
way
im
drinking
more
than
one
its
aroma
and
some
of
the
taste
remind
me
of
a
belgian
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
watery
smooth
and
it
would
flow
down
easy
if
the
alcohol
bite
wasnt
so
sharp
carbonation
was
basically
non
existent
with
a
tiny
hint
of
fizzle
a
very
heavy
body
and
a
tart
finish
that
lets
the
alcohol
kick
you
in
the
gut
on
the
way
down
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
love
founders
products
but
this
is
a
ski
resort
beer
and
one
to
sip
and
savor
not
what
i
was
expecting
overall
it
was
good
and
had
a
level
of
complexity
but
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
heavy
boozy
ale
well
done
by
founders
i
would
say
this
is
a
berleywine
though
the
abv
is
decently
hidden
give
it
a
try
edit
bottled
040911
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
as
expected
the
beer
is
pretty
sweet
at
the
onset
but
the
bitterness
of
the
finishes
creates
balance
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
the
higher
abv
is
masked
nicely
with
only
a
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
overall
solid
old
ale
while
this
could
definitely
use
some
age
i
could
happily
drink
this
often
as
is
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
character
of
great
divides
hibernation
ale
or
hair
of
the
dogs
adam
but
its
high
quality
not
a
homerun
but
another
really
good
beer
from
founders
overall
fairly
solid
just
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
looks
kind
of
lifeless
cheers
pours
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
2
inch
light
orange
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
malt
caramel
and
maybe
some
brown
sugar
taste
is
of
malt
caramel
brown
sugar
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
there
is
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
a
very
low
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
that
is
a
bit
flat
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
from
founders
but
the
mouthfeel
is
not
that
great
in
my
opinion
mediumfull
in
body
with
a
very
light
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
neither
thin
nor
heavy
some
sweet
caramel
notes
appear
up
front
mingling
within
are
notes
of
oak
vanilla
and
burnt
sugar
but
the
astringent
nature
of
the
middle
is
somewhat
offputting
and
carries
through
well
into
the
finish
with
an
almost
solventy
nature
the
finish
is
extremely
dry
and
displays
more
oak
barrel
notes
of
vanilla
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
not
dying
to
seek
it
out
again
but
it
is
good
just
as
everything
else
from
founders
has
been
mo
crisp
and
drinkable
with
some
very
good
weight
from
the
alcohol
very
good
strong
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
appearance
is
dark
amber
color
with
light
beige
head
aroma
is
of
malty
sweetness
toffee
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
boozyness
taste
is
complex
it
started
off
with
a
heavy
character
of
toasted
malts
sweet
bread
and
caramel
as
the
it
warmed
up
there
was
more
and
more
strong
dark
fruit
flavors
especially
plum
which
combined
with
the
alcohol
gave
it
a
somewhat
boozy
quality
as
my
palate
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
heavy
malt
bill
i
noticed
more
of
the
subtle
hop
bitterness
that
was
lying
underneath
palate
was
fullbodied
thick
in
texture
sitting
heavy
in
the
mouth
light
and
soft
carbonation
and
a
bitter
finish
not
my
choice
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
founders
overall
a
nice
nightcap
good
hop
presence
big
alcohol
and
some
fruity
notes
not
intended
for
the
meek
o
the
9
8
abv
is
not
well
hidden
the
finish
isnt
that
clean
and
it
a
little
sweet
ok
for
an
old
ale
but
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
m
as
my
palate
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
heavy
malt
bill
i
noticed
more
of
the
subtle
hop
bitterness
that
was
lying
underneath
palate
was
fullbodied
thick
in
texture
sitting
heavy
in
the
mouth
light
and
soft
carbonation
and
a
bitter
finish
overall
a
nice
tasting
old
ale
that
is
pretty
easy
drinking
considering
the
alcohol
o
overall
a
decent
old
ale
even
with
a
year
on
it
there
are
still
some
hop
and
alcohol
notes
present
unfortunately
i
think
it
may
have
oxidized
slightly
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
fresh
o
a
decent
old
ale
not
as
good
as
4d
or
kaiser
curmudgeon
but
still
very
drinkable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
old
ale
the
only
other
old
ale
i
have
had
was
third
coast
old
ale
so
i
dont
have
tons
of
experience
with
this
style
but
i
find
it
to
be
pretty
similar
to
a
barleywine
for
being
almost
10
this
beer
was
pretty
damn
drinkable
it
went
down
a
lot
faster
then
i
expected
even
though
the
alcohol
was
there
and
a
little
warming
it
was
still
hidden
and
blended
nicely
with
the
other
flavors
i
would
buy
a
four
pack
of
this
to
age
till
the
winter
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
make
a
nice
big
beer
to
drink
around
the
fireplace
during
the
winter
seems
like
this
beer
is
more
suited
for
a
winter
release
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
was
its
head
but
that
is
borderline
nitpicking
if
you
like
old
ales
barleywines
or
just
big
beers
in
general
this
is
a
must
try
founders
truly
is
the
king
of
big
beers
they
just
alway
turn
out
kick
ass
and
thats
what
makes
founders
one
of
michigans
best
brewing
companys
happy
drinking
founders
has
definitely
earned
my
repeat
business
got
quite
a
few
of
these
actually
so
im
gonna
see
how
they
age
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bit
stronger
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
thicker
feel
but
its
still
tasty
o
this
was
my
first
experience
w
an
old
ale
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
founders
is
a
really
fine
brewer
of
beers
and
i
have
not
been
let
down
by
this
one
at
all
in
fact
this
beer
has
made
me
want
to
search
out
others
of
this
style
highly
recommended
pours
a
great
looking
amber
brown
color
with
a
pretty
tan
head
forming
leaving
lace
behind
aroma
was
of
sweet
malts
with
a
light
caramel
and
heat
taste
was
interesting
for
a
old
ale
as
i
lean
more
towards
malt
base
for
this
style
this
old
ale
was
good
though
i
felt
the
malt
didnt
jump
out
and
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
to
much
the
brew
taste
too
crisp
for
this
stle
to
me
possibly
with
some
age
the
malt
may
jump
out
ahead
aging
the
last
3
brews
to
see
how
she
does
o
this
is
one
damn
fine
old
ale
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
every
aspect
of
this
beer
and
it
just
comes
off
as
a
cut
above
the
rest
the
high
alcohol
was
noticable
but
not
overpower
which
is
what
i
like
in
a
high
abv
beer
i
will
for
sure
get
this
one
again
overall
yet
another
amazing
offering
from
founders
and
something
that
i
would
definitely
pursue
again
its
really
too
bad
this
is
only
a
seasonal
offering
because
this
one
would
be
great
year
round
a
great
drinking
old
ale
that
hides
the
high
abv
very
well
smooth
crisp
and
almost
too
easy
drinking
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
in
a
heartbeat
and
hope
i
can
find
it
again
on
my
next
beer
haul
to
the
states
o
i
could
easily
drink
multiple
of
these
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
great
old
ale
booze
is
well
hidden
nicely
balanced
good
piny
resinous
balance
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
overall
another
good
beer
from
founders
they
are
working
their
way
up
to
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
had
right
up
there
with
bells
third
coast
old
ale
im
sure
this
would
be
a
real
winner
with
a
year
or
more
of
age
on
it
to
help
mellow
the
booziness
and
build
a
little
more
character
but
its
fantastic
fresh
as
well
a
really
solid
old
ale
by
my
favorite
brewery
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
thick
beer
surprisingly
fizzes
on
your
tongue
if
held
long
enough
the
high
carbonation
gives
it
a
nearly
creamy
mouthfeel
and
allows
for
great
drinkability
unfortunately
the
overly
bold
flavors
make
this
one
a
definite
sipper
overall
another
keeper
from
founders
wouldnt
call
it
a
homerun
necessarily
but
still
very
good
maybe
an
rbi
single
a
sip
is
grassy
pine
hops
quickly
assaulted
with
a
malty
dark
caramel
then
raisins
and
alcohol
thats
portlike
in
warmth
light
carbonation
slick
and
smooth
throughout
really
clinging
to
the
mouth
this
is
a
sipper
it
still
seems
hot
and
aggressive
even
for
an
old
ale
theres
already
a
lot
going
on
especially
as
it
warms
up
i
think
i
preferred
black
biscuit
more
but
this
is
really
enjoyable
overall
and
i
cant
wait
for
it
to
become
a
more
sedate
institutionalized
old
curmudgeon
d
another
quality
brew
from
founders
its
hard
to
find
anything
that
i
dont
like
from
them
the
oak
barrels
are
a
nice
touch
giving
this
beer
some
nice
flavor
o
a
very
good
beer
thats
a
definite
sipper
this
is
very
enjoyable
now
but
im
also
anxiously
anticipating
how
this
one
might
age
if
the
dark
fruits
note
come
out
and
the
heat
dies
down
just
a
bit
this
could
be
a
very
quaffable
brewstill
a
sipper
but
a
mighty
fine
sipper
o
very
tasty
old
ale
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
less
hops
probably
would
do
great
with
some
aging
curmudgeon
may
well
be
the
best
representation
of
this
style
available
on
the
market
today
and
i
wouldnt
know
it
because
i
have
little
experience
with
old
ales
would
i
buy
this
again
probably
not
would
i
buy
any
other
beers
of
this
style
possibly
but
there
are
other
styles
i
prefer
much
more
still
given
founders
reputation
and
the
quality
of
their
other
beers
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
overall
its
a
big
strong
boozy
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
some
say
its
too
much
but
hey
its
a
near
10
beer
and
its
made
by
founders
enough
said
right
i
would
swear
this
had
been
aged
in
oak
barrels
i
must
ask
is
this
really
a
old
ale
one
and
done
beer
for
sure
dpretty
good
considering
the
strength
doverall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
this
style
maybe
alittle
much
for
some
people
but
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
tastes
great
wont
be
having
more
than
2
of
these
a
night
or
i
might
end
up
passed
out
on
the
floor
very
good
beer
o
i
like
it
not
my
favorite
old
ale
but
thats
unfair
considering
i
dont
live
far
from
kuhnhenn
but
its
good
i
think
id
like
it
more
if
the
hops
were
a
bit
more
subdued
so
the
awesome
complex
malts
could
shine
it
makes
me
think
the
kaiser
curmudgeon
this
beer
aged
in
bourbonmaple
syrup
barrels
must
be
just
about
perfect
o
when
i
smelled
this
i
was
afraid
it
would
have
too
much
bourbon
flavor
im
really
not
fond
of
whiskey
or
anything
of
the
flavor
but
this
beer
was
pleasantly
flavorful
yet
not
overbearing
in
this
regard
the
sweetness
balanced
the
bite

ibus
cheers
as
im
mulling
the
fact
that
i
will
likely
be
snowed
in
tomorrow
i
figured
i
may
as
well
reach
for
something
to
hopefully
warm
me
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
kansas
city
i
was
excited
to
find
some
founders
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
their
old
curmudgeon
this
beer
pours
a
deep
orange
to
brown
and
is
apparantly
bottle
conditioned
who
knew
i
did
not
so
the
color
is
a
little
murky
but
i
blame
that
more
on
my
ameaturish
pour
than
anything
else
not
a
lot
of
head
smells
sweet
with
dark
molasses
and
brown
sugar
undertones
taste
is
hefty
with
a
very
very
thick
mouthfeel
and
clearly
apparant
alcohol
level
the
amount
of
hops
present
in
the
beer
makes
it
taste
almost
like
a
barleywine
as
opposed
to
an
old
ale
as
it
claims
to
be
beer
lends
itself
to
meandering
as
its
more
of
a
sipper
than
something
you
want
to
go
back
to
more
of
a
one
and
done
type
to
be
enjoyed
at
the
end
of
the
night
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
a
sipper
however
and
not
conducive
to
a
high
drinkability
standard
very
complex
this
would
go
well
on
a
cold
night
while
reading
a
book
i
personally
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
just
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
the
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
but
doesnt
detract
medium
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
very
solid
offering
and
enjoyable
d
if
you
like
the
taste
then
i
guess
drinkable
for
me
i
had
to
labor
d
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
ale
the
mouthfeel
was
the
most
interesting
part
of
this
beer
also
the
alcohol
can
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
have
a
few
of
these
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
of
beer
if
you
purchase
a
fresh
bottle
i
would
recommend
letting
it
cellar
for
a
little
because
the
alcohol
was
slightly
detectable
founders
knows
how
to
make
strong
beers
well
thats
for
sure
full
bodied
lighter
carbonation
sticky
and
syrupy
on
the
tongue
drinks
pretty
well
although
its
definitely
a
bit
on
the
warm
and
sweet
side
of
things
this
one
year
old
bottle
pours
deep
deep
copper
and
even
an
aggressive
pour
yields
no
head
and
no
lace
its
hazy
with
some
particles
just
hanging
out
not
moving
at
all
on
the
nose
there
are
vanilla
sweet
bready
malts
prunes
and
some
slight
booze
nice
to
see
a
big
barleywinetype
beer
in
america
made
that
doesnt
taste
like
a
cousin
of
a
dipa
in
the
mouth
a
huge
body
carries
down
a
slightly
prickly
breadiness
with
some
vanilla
and
oak
notes
the
finish
is
quite
long
mostly
alcohol
and
sweet
bread
up
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
nightcap
for
me
but
for
that
purpose
its
quite
good
i
first
tried
this
beer
at
6
months
and
the
oak
was
belligerently
obvious
and
far
too
sweet
now
at
9
months
it
is
quite
yummy
though
i
cant
help
but
wish
id
squirreled
it
away
a
bit
longer
brandy
dry
oats
caramel
a
tiny
bit
of
anise
id
like
the
malts
to
stand
out
a
bit
more
right
now
im
getting
that
oakedvanilla
taste
lingering
in
my
mouth
and
the
malts
in
the
background
whereas
i
want
them
in
opposite
roles
with
the
malts
nestled
snug
above
the
oak
a
short
time
did
wonders
for
the
beer
with
patience
this
could
be
an
excellent
old
ale
d
another
quality
brew
from
founders
its
hard
to
find
anything
that
i
dont
like
from
them
the
oak
barrels
are
a
nice
touch
giving
this
beer
some
nice
flavor
aging
the
remaining
3
we
will
see
how
they
turn
out
taste
is
pretty
hoppy
with
malt
sweetness
and
some
citrus
the
finish
is
quite
creamy
and
the
most
interesting
facet
of
this
beer
high
alcohol
but
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
but
then
its
hard
not
to
enjoy
anything
founders
puts
into
their
barrels
but
as
stated
numerous
times
in
this
review
curmudgeon
is
very
similar
to
backwoods
bastard
so
much
so
that
i
would
be
happy
to
take
a
backwoods
over
this
any
and
every
time
good
beer
but
not
great
but
hey
founders
has
that
covered
well
balanced
nice
old
ale
and
exceptionally
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
dont
taste
the
molasses
they
mention
having
included
but
it
could
have
certainly
contributed
to
the
mouthfeel
speaking
of
which
while
sporting
a
micro
drop
of
dry
musty
oxidation
is
nearly
silky
smooth
falling
quite
short
of
syrupy
goddamn
does
it
massage
the
palate
while
conjuring
one
of
the
most
soothing
warming
feelings
ive
been
treated
to
the
booze
is
softened
expertly
by
the
malt
and
semiviscous
body
they
balanced
the
shit
out
of
this
ale
a
winner
bottom
line
this
brew
is
very
well
balanced
and
offers
some
great
sweet
tastes
that
arent
seen
in
many
other
brews
the
intensity
and
richness
make
this
one
a
sipper
but
with
the
superbly
masked
abv
this
can
be
hard
to
do
i
do
wish
it
was
cheaper
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
10
fold
here
with
curmedgeon
d
its
a
bigger
beer
than
i
had
anticipated
however
i
think
with
an
additional
year
under
the
belt
this
beer
would
even
out
nicely
d
decent
drinkability
for
almost
10
abv
but
due
to
the
flavor
profile
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
poured
this
brew
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
reddishbrown
color
with
a
touch
of
sediment
reminded
me
of
the
way
apple
cider
would
look
in
a
snifter
there
is
very
little
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
upon
taking
a
few
sips
it
definitely
smells
sweet
a
little
bit
like
caramel
the
taste
is
also
sweet
starts
off
a
little
bit
sweet
and
i
think
i
taste
some
hoppiness
at
the
end
but
it
really
isnt
bitter
at
all
the
aftertaste
is
still
bit
sweet
this
is
a
thick
syrupy
sticky
beer
with
a
high
alcohol
content
and
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
style
and
i
think
its
delicious
finish
this
one
lingers
for
quite
some
time
with
hops
and
carmal
sickyness
notes
nice
brew
add
the
barrel
aging
and
do
we
have
the
backwoods
bastard
not
quite
but
there
is
something
rather
pleasing
that
reminds
of
that
brew
and
that
stands
very
well
on
its
own
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
great
night
cap
eather
after
a
long
hard
day
of
working
outside
in
the
elements
or
just
to
relax
this
is
the
beer
to
choose
cheers
d
a
higher
abv
makes
this
a
sipper
by
the
fire
a
very
well
put
together
old
ale
i
like
this
crotchety
old
fella
and
will
have
it
again
but
ive
also
had
other
old
ales
that
i
like
a
bit
better
it
is
definitely
not
sessionable
but
makes
for
a
good
sipper
this
is
another
fine
offering
from
founders
but
certainly
not
their
best
drinkability
a
fun
and
complex
beer
sweet
with
lots
of
bite
so
i
am
not
sure
i
could
drink
this
all
night
avoid
for
me
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
there
is
also
suspended
sediment
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
strong
alcohol
slight
oak
and
slight
citrus
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
old
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
alcohol
oak
slight
citrus
hops
slight
yeast
and
hint
of
sweet
malt
overall
overly
strong
in
the
alcohol
not
very
complex
but
definitely
warming
this
beer
is
thick
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
lighten
things
up
reasonably
drinkable
considering
the
abv
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
too
many
d
big
sipper
and
mighty
fine
brew
this
gets
better
as
is
reaches
closer
to
room
temperature
i
will
hoard
the
4
pack
i
bought
for
special
occasions
over
the
next
year
and
share
with
worthy
beer
geeks
this
beer
once
again
proves
to
me
why
i
love
founders
just
damn
fine
complex
and
delicious
beer
very
unique
flavor
is
imparted
by
the
oak
barrel
aging
not
quite
sure
about
it
at
first
but
it
rewards
the
drinker
with
subtle
flavors
when
given
the
chance
to
present
itself
on
a
clean
palate
i
could
see
how
this
may
turnoff
some
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
consume
it
as
a
night
cap
o
a
good
sipper
very
enjoyable
lower
carbonation
sticky
body
but
not
too
thick
the
almost
2
years
of
aging
has
mellowed
out
any
alcohol
burn
once
i
recovered
about
midbeer
from
initial
sugar
shock
i
kinda
got
sick
of
this
beer
a
good
night
time
reading
companion
but
i
couldnt
ever
imagining
having
more
than
one
unless
i
put
it
on
waffles
d
one
of
the
best
strong
ales
ive
sampled
will
likely
get
better
over
time
but
in
a
young
form
its
not
in
your
face
strong
and
very
repeatable
drinkability
is
excellent
as
there
a
fair
amount
here
to
discover
one
or
two
is
good
for
a
single
sitting
which
is
good
because
in
addition
to
founders
quality
they
have
the
founders
price
point
a
murky
orange
stirs
bubbles
rise
a
large
pillar
of
foam
rises
in
the
center
gradually
tucks
away
under
itself
to
the
sides
it
is
a
stately
affair
all
the
nobles
are
here
foreign
dignataries
the
upper
crust
bono
of
course
bono
stale
and
sweet
fumes
arise
from
the
powdered
wigs
of
the
hallowed
guests
their
breath
is
alcohol
this
is
an
old
ale
for
old
money
a
plate
passes
around
the
room
full
or
succulent
grapes
fresh
and
dried
and
dried
apricots
distinctly
and
with
a
stiff
backbone
it
slides
down
the
throat
pricking
with
funk
the
soul
of
james
brown
these
old
fogies
can
still
get
down
get
up
get
on
up
long
sweet
finish
the
harpsichord
notes
ring
out
echoing
in
the
high
ceilings
d
a
good
sipper
ill
leave
it
at
that
would
do
better
with
some
age
on
it
d
its
a
sipper
boozy
bite
makes
it
one
to
drink
slow
sweet
and
complex
but
strong
and
one
to
sip
d
one
of
these
is
plenty
in
a
session
it
isnt
bad
by
any
means
but
it
is
purely
one
dimensional
and
i
could
have
gotten
roughly
the
same
experience
out
of
a
bourbon
and
water
wish
i
could
say
there
is
a
bit
more
in
here
but
it
is
pretty
basic
in
its
complexity
i
really
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
style
as
im
fairly
unfamiliar
with
it
right
now
but
i
was
impressed
and
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
an
extremely
complex
brew
but
also
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
i
kinda
want
to
get
a
sixer
and
cellar
some
of
it
to
see
what
would
happen
another
superb
offering
from
founders
what
a
surprise
poured
with
no
head
and
a
murky
weathered
copper
color
very
thin
wispy
off
white
lacings
lay
on
top
after
the
pour
sweet
caramel
malt
ripe
apple
spice
and
oak
aromas
combined
with
the
hint
of
alcohol
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
a
light
sweet
bourbon
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
thick
mouth
feel
as
the
latent
carbonation
slowly
comes
to
life
sweet
caramel
malt
and
ripe
apple
flavors
hints
of
spice
finishes
with
an
alcoholic
burn
and
a
pine
hop
flavor
definitely
a
sipper
that
warms
the
soul
think
deeply
of
the
ocean
and
keep
a
fourpack
in
a
cooler
as
the
waves
lap
the
shores
at
night
be
one
with
the
seas
and
stars
taste
is
very
wheaty
oddly
enough
its
a
bit
bitter
and
also
quite
malty
theres
some
light
caramel
and
certainly
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
overall
quite
decent
d
this
is
definitely
a
slow
sipping
beer
not
to
be
abused
a
buddy
of
mine
aged
his
for
about
2
years
and
it
tasted
a
lot
different
than
my
batch
which
had
just
been
bought
at
the
time
d
the
alcohol
lets
you
know
its
there
and
delays
you
from
pouring
a
second
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
remember
the
first
time
that
i
had
it
i
absolutely
hated
it
but
now
with
a
second
go
around
and
a
better
understanding
of
what
an
old
ale
is
i
can
really
appreciate
this
one
perfect
for
a
cooler
autumn
evening
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
solid
take
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
night
d
this
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
it
is
good
its
almost
like
a
light
wheat
wine
perhaps
not
a
perfect
representation
of
the
style
but
quite
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
style
characteristics
and
abv
nice
comforting
thick
mouthfeel
average
mouthfeel
not
too
carbonated
which
works
well
for
the
abv
this
is
a
great
sipper
id
love
to
compare
to
a
fresh
bottle
i
really
liked
this
a
lot
the
strong
bitter
note
of
piney
hops
is
equalled
by
a
strong
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
candy
like
quality
and
slightly
salty
and
acidic
tinge
from
the
high
alpha
hops
with
the
flavors
of
alcohol
and
stone
fruit
essence
the
hops
have
a
woody
character
and
mild
acidity
in
the
taste
w
a
mild
tanginess
of
grapefruit
that
is
noted
as
it
finishes
this
old
ale
is
a
good
beer
but
i
consider
it
slightly
hop
forward
for
the
style
it
is
tasty
and
hoppy
but
just
misses
the
mark
to
be
considered
classic
tastewise
i
enjoy
it
and
the
alcohol
is
mild
which
is
nice
so
it
seem
above
avg
all
around
to
me
d
great
tasting
brew
my
first
old
ale
and
glad
to
have
it
that
way
i
knocked
down
this
score
somewhat
because
the
alc
as
i
noted
is
very
warming
and
could
see
how
more
than
one
of
this
could
get
you
in
trouble
but
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
in
this
style
i
would
almost
classify
this
brew
as
a
sipper
but
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
says
otherwise
this
is
unexpected
in
a
good
way
for
the
style
could
be
dangerous
due
to
the
abv
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
i
have
tried
to
date
it
was
bottled
in
022010
giving
it
about
8
months
to
age
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
both
fresh
and
after
aging
at
least
12
months
enormous
amount
of
malt
flavor
and
aroma
while
hops
do
a
nice
job
of
keeping
it
interesting
without
dominating
the
senses
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
solid
offering
but
nothing
special
ive
had
better
from
both
the
brewery
and
the
style
the
body
is
a
balance
of
making
a
smooth
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
3
5444
54
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
viscous
but
i
think
thats
expected
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
of
these
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
delivered
what
it
claimed
to
be
on
the
label
this
somehow
manages
to
remain
pretty
easy
drinking
even
though
the
alcohol
isnt
all
that
well
hidden
a
decent
beer
but
not
quite
sure
i
can
really
say
its
anywhere
near
some
of
the
great
founders
brews
ive
tried
d
and
yum
seriously
good
but
not
as
good
as
old
stock
or
third
coast
a
very
well
crafted
beer
personally
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
the
dark
fruit
flavors
almost
seem
a
little
rumlike
a
very
big
beer
with
large
palate
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
red
wine
like
along
with
a
toasted
dark
bread
bluntness
very
creamy
and
maybe
a
little
oily
slickness
and
warming
to
the
palate
in
the
end
pours
slightly
hazed
orangeish
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
becomes
a
wisp
some
vanishing
lace
sticks
the
smell
is
of
honey
caramel
nuts
reminiscent
of
honeycovered
walnuts
dipped
in
caramel
there
is
a
fruitiness
towards
datesprunes
the
taste
is
sweet
honey
and
caramel
not
catching
the
50
ibus
sweetness
balanced
by
an
ashy
smokiness
that
leaves
a
burnt
aftertaste
the
burnt
character
shows
in
some
sips
more
than
in
others
oddly
enough
not
digging
that
part
which
puts
a
dent
in
the
flavour
alcohol
present
but
not
too
sharp
or
overwhelming
fullbodied
and
a
bit
sticky
mild
carbonation
does
cut
through
the
thickness
im
never
clear
on
where
the
line
is
drawn
between
an
old
ale
and
a
barleywine
this
beer
could
happily
land
in
either
category
body
is
a
bit
syrupy
redolent
with
dark
aged
fruit
flavors
prune
most
apparentl
a
boozy
edge
is
a
slight
detraction
finish
is
smooth
with
a
lasting
caramel
note
d
sweet
oily
and
thick
ok
for
a
pint
but
not
much
more
d
too
malty
and
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
tastes
definitely
a
sipper
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
english
bwine
after
a
year
or
so
in
the
bottle
d
one
glass
is
good
it
is
a
little
too
spicy
this
beer
just
either
needs
age
or
just
is
a
rare
strike
for
founders
i
think
most
beer
lovers
will
enjoy
this
beer
but
its
just
not
up
to
par
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
quite
different
from
what
most
american
breweries
are
putting
out
these
days
certainly
one
ill
have
again
but
not
in
the
same
night
d
this
beer
tastes
fine
but
gives
you
a
really
good
alcohol
burn
down
in
your
esophagus
i
doubt
anyone
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
doesnt
retain
well
the
aroma
is
a
step
up
with
notes
of
vanilla
molasses
oak
spiced
rum
dark
fruits
plum
fig
black
cherry
floral
hops
and
alcohol
the
flavor
starts
out
with
spiced
rum
notes
along
with
caramel
molasses
vanilla
and
oak
as
well
as
some
cocoa
and
dark
fruits
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
drinkability
is
ok
an
intriguing
if
a
bit
cloying
old
ale
that
is
heavy
on
the
oak
and
caramel
flavors
the
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
because
of
the
alcohol
burn
in
there
i
find
that
it
is
this
way
with
a
lot
of
founders
beers
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
an
old
ale
not
the
most
complex
or
subtle
ive
had
but
very
enjoyable
pours
a
gorgeous
shade
of
dark
orange
amber
there
was
pretty
much
no
head
on
this
at
all
but
the
slight
ring
of
foam
left
on
the
glass
leaves
a
very
precise
high
water
mark
like
a
ring
around
a
bathtub
this
makes
me
giggle
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
golden
raisins
and
sweet
bread
there
is
also
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
but
its
mostly
just
malt
that
i
am
picking
up
the
flavor
is
malty
and
wonderful
plenty
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
toffee
mix
with
a
sharp
hint
of
alcohol
that
works
to
further
enhance
the
flavor
also
in
the
mix
are
raisins
sugary
orange
peel
some
peppery
earthiness
and
touch
of
honey
there
seems
to
be
just
enough
bitterness
in
this
beer
to
keep
it
from
being
too
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
damn
impressive
it
is
not
quite
as
full
as
one
might
expect
but
also
far
from
too
thin
the
finish
a
mile
long
but
not
too
sticky
a
beer
to
savor
but
a
beer
i
would
love
to
savor
again
i
am
pretty
sure
my
friend
didnt
purposely
pick
out
an
older
bottle
but
i
am
glad
he
did
i
will
have
to
seek
out
a
fresher
one
for
comparison
drinkability
is
all
right
curmudgeon
has
some
good
aspects
but
fails
to
really
pull
things
off
i
keep
wanting
to
like
the
glass
in
front
of
me
but
nothing
really
pulls
me
back
the
beer
is
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
old
ales
or
founders
but
otherwise
its
just
a
slightly
above
average
old
ale
in
the
craft
beer
world
md
has
a
medium
syruplike
body
flat
on
the
palate
from
low
volumes
of
carbonation
and
finishes
sweet
the
alcohol
flavor
complimented
with
the
sweetness
and
thickish
body
make
it
a
definite
sipper
but
fun
to
drink
pours
a
rich
amber
color
little
to
no
head
which
quickly
dissipates
with
very
limited
lacing
strong
oak
and
bread
aromas
a
definite
sweet
thick
oak
flavor
with
the
thick
consistency
typical
of
a
founders
brew
which
doesnt
quite
hold
up
as
well
as
the
stouts
due
to
lesser
complexity
very
subtle
spice
notes
emerge
through
the
alcohol
and
oak
notes
reminiscent
of
a
good
rye
bread
overall
ive
had
this
one
a
couple
of
times
before
and
i
really
want
to
cheer
for
it
each
time
because
founders
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
biz
however
even
after
analyzing
it
in
my
session
this
still
remains
one
of
my
least
favorite
founders
brews
d
pretty
good
overall
beer
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
and
will
have
to
pick
up
more
of
these
real
smooth
for
the
abv
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
pick
up
more
d
good
rep
for
the
style
especially
with
the
addition
of
oak
aging
d
overall
the
bottle
date
kind
of
scared
me
but
as
a
bourbon
beer
i
was
intrigued
to
try
it
and
found
it
to
be
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
with
less
sediment
than
the
nemesis
2009
and
even
cheaper
at
4
25
a
bottle
i
believe
this
beer
is
pretty
epic
with
age
and
may
go
back
and
get
another
still
a
very
solid
beer
after
a
year
and
a
half
so
bravo
founders
dthis
beer
has
average
drinkability
the
abv
isnt
obvious
or
out
of
whack
but
it
isnt
balanced
as
well
as
it
could
be
drinkability
give
me
5
more
but
youll
have
to
drive
me
home
drinkability
bold
and
beautiful
a
quality
sipper
even
on
a
day
in
south
filled
with
100degree
heat
and
100percent
humidity
i
look
forward
to
buying
this
again
d
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
with
big
bold
flavors
i
think
i
could
go
for
a
2nd
one
i
was
slightly
disappointed
when
pouring
this
beer
into
the
glass
as
it
had
a
small
fleeting
head
and
was
a
clear
reddish
color
after
beginning
to
sip
however
my
disappointment
left
about
as
quickly
as
the
beers
head
the
beer
smelled
had
a
pleasant
alcohol
laden
smell
kind
of
had
a
hint
of
whiskey
to
it
the
taste
is
maltier
than
i
expected
given
the
color
but
its
not
overwhelming
again
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
good
bourbon
it
isnt
the
smoothest
beer
in
world
but
is
still
pleasant
very
drinkable
and
overall
a
great
beer
would
gladly
have
another
definitely
a
sipper
i
dont
think
i
could
have
two
of
these
in
a
week
let
alone
in
one
night
however
it
is
enjoyable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
hearty
brew
drinkability
while
i
cant
see
this
being
an
everyday
beer
i
definitely
will
enjoy
this
again
i
have
3
bottles
left
from
my
4
pack
that
i
want
to
age
a
little
bit
d
quite
nice
though
i
prefer
my
old
ale
to
be
bitterer
and
therefore
hoppier
believe
it
or
not
bitterer
is
a
word
according
to
microsoftword
and
it
is
more
preferable
in
usage
than
more
bitter
so
please
go
back
fellow
bas
and
correct
your
verbiage
in
prior
reviews
as
i
have
done
here
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
low
drinkability
is
good
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
to
sip
on
tonight
after
dinner
it
had
some
great
malty
flavors
to
it
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
bad
at
all
for
the
abv
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
oaky
vanilla
and
malt
in
the
taste
oak
vanilla
a
pinch
of
bourbon
like
flavor
and
small
alcohol
notes
a
smooth
body
and
medium
to
lighter
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
alcohol
and
oaky
aftertaste
looks
lighter
than
expected
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
too
but
nice
flavor
this
beer
is
darker
amber
with
a
little
bit
of
redness
the
smell
is
a
complex
blend
of
raisins
maple
syrup
and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
that
i
may
or
may
not
be
hallucinating
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
with
maple
syrup
dark
wine
and
toffee
with
the
alcohol
nicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
sipping
beer
which
evolves
as
it
warms
very
enjoyable
notes
pretty
average
version
of
an
old
ale
all
in
all
this
brew
definitely
followed
suit
with
the
first
time
i
tried
it
just
ok
not
much
special
in
this
one
not
worth
hunting
and
do
not
make
this
a
priority
to
try
if
you
have
access
beer
is
thick
and
syrupy
very
heavy
its
strong
and
heavy
on
the
palate
this
is
much
bigger
than
i
expected
but
its
still
good
overall
an
enjoyable
big
strong
ale
d
one
of
these
is
enough
at
a
time
it
is
an
enjoyable
experience
but
i
doubt
id
get
the
same
kick
out
of
a
second
not
a
session
beer
enjoy
this
baby
one
at
a
time
and
let
the
others
age
honestly
this
socalled
curmudgeon
doesnt
seem
all
that
misanthropic
to
me
just
a
colderclimate
version
o
good
ol
santiago
something
like
that
anyway
the
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
tinted
slightly
toward
amber
topped
by
a
short
head
o
ecru
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
biscuits
walnuts
rich
caramel
and
a
stinging
underbelly
of
bright
fruit
a
healthy
boozy
feel
slices
through
dully
marring
the
nasal
proceedings
the
taste
continues
the
malty
tradition
set
forth
in
the
smell
in
the
process
transmogrifying
the
fruit
into
a
hoppy
bitterness
strong
and
dull
a
touch
of
leather
rules
the
aftertaste
i
cant
call
this
a
balanced
flavor
but
i
wont
go
so
far
as
to
declare
a
state
of
koyaanisqatsi
either
hell
that
damn
droning
is
just
annoying
and
kinda
boring
after
a
while
too
ahem
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
very
slight
mouthcoating
feel
overall
an
ok
brew
but
not
one
i
would
regularly
pursue
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
served
7jul2010
it
pours
a
redder
color
than
when
fresh
the
nose
has
noticeably
diminished
to
a
shell
of
itself
some
oak
and
mellow
vanilla
notes
are
present
though
the
taste
however
is
superb
malty
caramelly
sweetness
upfront
moves
on
to
a
slight
tobacco
cognac
and
toastedburnt
malt
flavor
this
finishes
with
a
slight
aged
hop
bitterness
mixed
with
oak
and
a
really
nice
vanilla
pop
fantastic
taste
the
alcohol
has
noticeably
settled
and
makes
for
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
d
i
cant
say
that
i
would
reach
for
another
one
of
these
but
you
are
supposed
to
age
it
and
so
i
will
and
see
where
it
takes
me
there
is
just
a
weirdness
right
now
that
makes
me
want
to
stay
away
d
ill
get
another
one
and
hold
onto
it
for
a
long
while
let
it
get
even
older
i
think
perhaps
this
one
was
a
bit
too
young
d
an
all
around
great
strong
beer
not
too
over
the
top
but
a
very
enjoyable
brew
md
medium
to
fuller
body
pretty
smooth
over
the
palate
low
and
very
soft
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
low
for
this
since
its
a
malt
bomb
intense
woody
and
candied
malt
flavors
and
the
alcohol
factor
bring
down
the
drinkability
more
of
a
sipper
something
about
this
makes
me
think
of
fall
its
good
but
i
cant
see
myself
ever
having
more
then
one
in
a
night
had
as
a
single
in
a
mix
6
pack
of
michigan
beers
cool
label
that
fits
the
name
pours
a
golden
orange
bit
hazy
no
head
or
lacing
sweet
oak
whiskey
smell
very
inviting
taste
follows
nicely
with
whiskey
and
dried
dark
fruits
warm
mouthfeel
with
much
smoother
taste
feel
than
the
alcohol
content
would
suggest
could
drink
a
few
m
d
very
oily
and
viscous
nice
full
body
dangerous
drinkability
for
a
beer
with
such
high
abv
summary
i
like
this
ale
for
its
immediate
alcohol
slam
im
sitting
here
on
fathers
day
afternoon
and
enjoying
the
good
buzz
as
i
finish
this
beer
im
sitting
in
my
screened
in
porch
and
waiting
for
my
old
curmudgeon
neighbor
to
walk
by
so
i
can
yell
something
rude
at
him
this
ale
brings
out
the
best
in
me
founder
remains
one
of
my
favorite
brews
for
flavor
quality
and
unique
variety
of
beers
full
bodied
with
some
carbonation
and
it
is
needed
to
clear
for
the
next
sip
and
that
is
how
this
drinks
a
pure
sipper
this
is
not
summer
beer
but
winter
in
the
easy
chair
or
fireside
in
the
fall
this
one
is
a
bit
hot
alcohol
almost
to
a
fault
if
the
booze
was
toned
down
i
could
see
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
since
it
isnt
im
one
and
done
decent
beer
but
to
be
had
as
a
change
of
pace
or
a
seasonal
treat
i
poured
into
my
glass
to
a
small
light
tan
head
it
is
a
ruddy
amber
color
i
get
a
nice
toasted
caramel
scent
along
with
some
alcohol
it
also
has
a
bready
smell
in
there
too
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
tasted
caramel
malt
but
it
does
lack
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
that
i
got
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
i
like
nice
and
viscous
overall
it
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
on
tap
at
the
brass
rail
today
during
lunch
served
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
it
appears
a
clear
amber
color
with
some
lighter
orange
colors
around
the
edges
and
a
thin
lacing
of
yellowish
tanned
head
spotty
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sweet
malty
grains
with
a
touch
of
orange
character
taste
has
a
welcoming
warmth
of
alcohol
that
is
also
solvent
in
flavor
upfront
with
a
sweet
malty
caramel
backing
and
light
citrus
hop
bitterness
that
mingles
with
a
flavor
of
bitter
orange
rind
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
a
resinelike
piney
flavor
medium
to
heavy
body
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
other
flavors
of
grain
linger
in
the
mouth
as
it
warms
more
residual
sugars
come
out
in
the
taste
much
like
dark
sugar
akin
to
caramel
that
has
somewhat
of
a
smokey
quality
about
it
overall
pretty
decent
but
doesnt
have
the
wowing
factor
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
most
founders
offerings
overall
it
is
one
beautiful
looking
and
beautifully
scented
brew
the
taste
is
good
but
not
spectacular
overall
a
great
brew
that
compares
favorably
to
the
only
beer
ive
given
all
5s
to
north
coast
old
stock
and
is
certainly
worth
your
time
overall
a
really
nice
and
readily
available
now
that
founders
is
in
ny
beverage
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
bubbly
semitransparent
dark
honey
golden
the
way
it
was
poured
i
wasnt
able
to
comment
on
the
head
malty
aroma
has
a
honeysweet
overtone
malty
lively
flavor
has
hints
of
spice
a
nice
alcohol
bite
and
a
hoppy
undertone
edgy
fizzy
texture
has
a
fierce
brandylike
bite
d
pretty
strong
brew
but
good
enough
to
have
a
few
dvery
good
old
ale
i
would
get
it
again
not
sure
i
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
it
is
great
for
what
it
is
this
brew
poured
a
cloudy
orangish
red
with
a
beautiful
head
to
it
the
smell
is
amazing
sweet
malts
with
vanilla
and
a
slight
fruitiness
i
also
get
a
hint
of
whiskey
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
is
made
but
i
could
swear
that
its
aged
in
whiskey
barrels
because
i
get
such
a
strong
whiskey
taste
after
sipping
it
its
delicious
sweet
cherries
vanilla
and
whiskey
in
this
wonderfully
complex
ale
love
it
d
a
great
sipper
if
there
ever
was
one
this
brew
shows
the
oak
well
with
heavy
vanilla
notes
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
old
alesbarleywines
out
there
overall
this
was
a
very
well
done
old
ale
and
does
a
great
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
worth
a
shot
there
is
an
initial
bite
of
hops
that
comes
back
on
the
exhale
but
soothed
midway
by
sweet
caramel
molasses
flavors
im
getting
through
this
faster
than
expected
the
complexity
makes
each
sip
entertaining
to
dissect
the
alcohol
is
disguised
dangerously
well
smooth
textures
carbonation
struggles
to
get
through
the
viscosity
as
an
old
ale
i
find
it
over
all
very
interesting
i
wouldnt
drink
this
with
a
meal
its
pretty
filling
and
its
got
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
already
drinkability
easy
drinking
for
sure
as
this
beer
walked
way
more
of
a
balance
then
i
even
had
expected
with
malt
and
hop
goes
down
dangerously
fast
hard
to
tell
this
is
9
8
percent
at
all
while
this
beer
is
certainly
good
not
sure
yet
if
i
would
call
it
great
rather
just
solid
oak
adds
a
nice
touch
and
the
heat
of
abv
is
minimal
to
none
i
feel
though
it
would
made
it
less
balanced
i
was
almost
hoping
for
a
bit
more
malt
from
this
than
amount
of
hop
they
threw
in
at
very
least
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
pours
a
hazy
dark
honey
color
with
a
smallish
tight
head
that
settles
into
a
ring
the
aroma
is
faint
did
not
pick
up
much
perhaps
a
touch
of
scorched
caramel
toffee
the
taste
has
a
very
mellow
toffee
and
vanilla
flavor
nothing
sharp
quite
smooth
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
different
from
most
old
ales
seems
to
focus
on
vanilla
i
worried
that
it
might
be
cloying
but
it
never
does
very
good
a
moderate
feel
with
tingly
carbonation
which
helps
cut
the
potential
cloyingness
of
the
brew
the
abv
is
no
where
to
be
found
this
is
a
very
tasty
old
ale
i
like
the
vanilla
profile
i
am
interested
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
brew
there
is
a
prominent
nose
of
fruitmalt
with
hints
of
wood
and
aging
raisins
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
warming
and
robust
as
you
move
through
the
bottle
an
excellent
winter
warmer
as
noted
by
others
the
classic
modest
carbonation
of
founders
brews
appears
again
fortunastely
for
me
this
what
i
love
any
time
of
year
to
me
contrary
opinions
suggest
this
would
say
that
i
wouldnt
want
another
glass
of
a
full
cab
or
that
i
wouldnt
be
having
a
vintage
port
in
the
summer
folks
this
is
an
awesome
sipping
beer
for
any
time
i
agree
with
previous
reviewer
that
i
will
age
a
few
for
those
who
enjoy
a
full
warming
sipper
to
enjoy
as
you
relax
at
end
of
day
rush
to
purchase
is
founders
great
or
what
d
on
the
mouthfeel
still
the
carbonation
is
pretty
limited
and
this
is
an
area
founders
routinely
excels
in
they
never
overcarbonate
their
beers
and
they
dont
have
to
the
flavors
and
uniqueness
of
all
their
brews
speak
for
themselves
another
not
only
great
but
spectacular
beer
from
founders
its
very
filling
though
and
you
probably
cant
have
more
than
1
one
of
my
very
favorite
breweries
will
be
buying
this
again
very
soon
wowhmmm
i
dont
think
this
is
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
but
definitely
has
a
bourbon
like
flavor
raisin
flavor
is
a
little
strong
medium
body
high
carbonation
boozy
this
beer
has
some
resemblences
to
bad
habit
quad
by
founders
overall
a
good
beer
but
closer
to
a
belgian
style
dark
ale
than
an
old
ale
in
my
oppinion
d
this
beer
is
always
a
struggle
for
me
and
i
dont
know
why
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
it
is
always
a
sipper
for
me
it
is
always
a
welcome
for
me
but
sometimes
too
much
for
me
to
finish
one
of
a
few
beers
that
is
like
that
for
me
another
good
offering
from
founders
thankful
that
theyre
distributing
in
ny
now
glad
to
have
tried
this
d
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
its
definitely
a
good
beer
to
sip
drinkability
great
winter
warmer
beer
enjoyed
as
usual
with
founders
drinkability
my
bottle
has
a
date
of
022409
should
of
waited
a
little
longer
and
let
the
hops
fade
some
more
but
still
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
im
not
sure
if
its
the
temperature
or
if
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
but
the
strong
hoppysolventy
nature
in
the
middle
is
quite
overpowering
and
makes
this
a
little
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
it
is
reminiscent
of
nemesis
2009
but
in
a
bad
way
as
the
barrel
aging
notes
and
the
base
character
of
the
beer
are
a
bit
similar
but
the
strength
of
flavor
that
with
nemesis
2009
works
so
well
in
this
beer
works
to
its
detriment
perhaps
ill
have
to
attempt
another
bottle
or
maybe
i
just
have
an
aversion
to
curmudgeons
in
general
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
amber
using
the
duvel
glass
the
taste
is
of
roasted
dark
malts
with
dark
fruits
lingering
in
a
delicious
treat
the
second
best
old
ale
i
have
had
compared
to
4th
dementia
this
was
very
damn
easy
to
drink
as
i
didnt
detect
the
9
8
at
all
very
smooth
and
quite
delicious
i
will
definately
pick
this
beer
up
again
a
good
sipper
for
a
nightcap
goes
well
paired
with
chocolate
cookies
medium
body
beer
with
slight
carbonation
alcohol
isnt
over
powering
however
if
you
didnt
sip
the
first
one
you
should
consider
sipping
the
second
a
nice
ale
by
founders
d
great
old
ale
this
is
one
of
my
new
faves
i
cant
believe
it
isnt
rated
higher
this
is
an
excellent
brew
medium
not
too
thick
mouthfeel
not
as
boozy
as
expected
a
nice
sipper
dthis
is
a
delicious
brew
i
tried
mine
after
keeping
it
for
about
4
months
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
the
four
packs
over
the
next
year
a
great
beer
but
way
better
with
some
age
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
one
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
oak
oak
is
there
on
the
palate
as
well
with
sweet
malt
vanilla
and
hints
of
bourbon
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overbearing
smooth
appropriately
carbonated
and
fairly
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
level
another
good
offering
from
founders
drinkability
quite
drinkable
considering
the
big
malt
attack
this
beer
summons
alcohol
might
sneak
up
on
you
though
drinkability
is
good
and
pretty
easy
drinking
considering
the
abv
i
think
its
better
as
one
a
night
sipping
beer
just
because
i
feel
the
alcohol
might
creep
up
on
you
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
i
would
have
another
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
orange
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
burnt
toffee
scent
thats
rich
and
full
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
dry
alcohol
driven
feel
thats
loaded
with
caramel
malt
and
burnt
toffee
sweetness
it
goes
down
slow
and
easy
with
a
nice
bit
of
warmth
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
solid
old
ale
its
brewed
to
style
and
drinks
well
as
for
drinkability
the
first
glass
went
down
way
to
easy
and
i
was
well
into
my
second
glass
when
the
gravity
of
this
brew
sank
in
probably
a
good
idea
to
sip
it
but
its
pretty
good
if
you
dont
too
d
a
very
nice
old
ale
and
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
throughout
an
evening
drinkability
very
drinkable
easily
drink
a
4
pack
9
8
alcohol
and
no
burn
watchout
the
rust
colored
body
was
clear
quite
still
and
was
topped
by
a
small
layer
of
bubbles
the
smell
was
bready
and
honey
sweet
with
a
late
spicy
flourish
the
taste
was
very
sweet
as
expected
with
the
flavors
evoking
hard
candy
pears
and
maple
syrup
very
rich
on
the
tongue
due
to
the
high
sugar
content
alcohol
was
not
as
evident
as
i
was
anticipating
not
much
hop
presence
the
sweetness
pretty
much
overpowered
all
other
senses
and
drove
down
the
drinkability
a
bit
a
very
malty
beer
to
be
sure
but
also
a
very
nuanced
one
at
the
same
time
try
it
sometime
this
is
very
good
i
want
to
age
some
but
the
twist
offs
make
me
leary
d
it
has
great
flavor
and
makes
for
a
nice
winter
sipper
its
very
nicely
done
however
founders
brews
several
beers
that
are
arguably
my
favorite
of
eachs
respective
style
breakfast
stout
reds
rye
and
porter
so
im
not
sure
i
could
bring
myself
to
purchase
it
over
those
other
more
sessionable
beers
although
i
will
certainly
be
excited
if
its
offered
to
me
again
id
love
to
try
some
of
this
stuff
with
some
age
on
it
a
fairly
good
but
green
beer
i
think
that
as
it
ages
the
alcoholic
notes
will
be
replaced
by
malty
richness
and
this
will
be
delightful
in
a
few
years
time
drinkability
this
review
is
on
an
09
bottle
ill
say
that
when
its
early
it
can
perhaps
be
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
but
with
just
a
year
this
thing
gets
really
smooth
and
is
one
of
my
favorites
by
founders
i
enjoyed
this
beer
however
this
seems
more
like
a
barleywine
than
an
old
ale
has
a
distinct
oxidized
sherry
raisin
flavor
the
nose
is
a
bit
offputting
but
flavor
in
the
mouth
is
much
more
agreeable
drinks
very
well
for
nearly
10
body
is
lighter
than
expected
the
others
tasting
this
commented
that
they
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
but
i
surely
could
down
several
d
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
definitely
something
i
am
thankful
for
trying
but
certainly
1
will
be
enough
for
me
a
grand
achievement
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
drinkability
is
ok
between
the
high
abv
and
the
overall
sweet
taste
and
alcohol
presence
this
is
a
oneandout
nightcap
type
of
beer
d
excellent
for
the
abv
i
could
easily
enjoy
one
or
two
more
unfortunately
i
only
bought
one
overall
complex
pretty
tasty
probably
not
for
everyone
but
a
good
sipper
not
an
a
but
not
a
d
either
by
any
means
by
the
way
the
picture
of
the
bottle
on
this
site
has
a
lovely
background
it
really
brings
out
the
grizzled
old
man
on
the
bottle
cheers
pours
a
very
dark
black
like
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
maple
syrup
and
caramel
malt
backbone
with
dark
fruits
raisins
dates
and
figs
present
and
a
touch
of
some
breadiness
the
taste
is
of
a
maple
syrup
backbone
on
top
with
dark
fruits
and
some
caramel
with
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
slight
amount
of
carbonation
it
does
sit
a
little
heavy
on
the
tongue
overall
the
drinkability
is
okay
for
the
style
it
is
very
complex
in
nature
and
keeps
you
interested
a
little
thicker
than
some
though
d
at
9
3
this
is
big
beer
and
fairly
drinkable
the
complexity
and
slight
boozy
quality
makes
it
a
little
less
drinkable
but
pretty
nice
overall
wish
i
had
these
guys
around
here
d
slightly
syrupy
with
a
little
bit
of
a
medicinal
edgehard
to
say
if
it
will
improve
with
age
probably
worth
a
shot
though
doverall
i
actually
am
enjoying
it
its
above
average
thats
for
sure
founders
seems
to
be
consistently
delivering
for
me
higher
alcohol
my
second
beer
for
the
night
and
im
already
feeling
it
halfway
through
my
glass
so
probably
my
last
nice
warm
beer
for
the
weird
winter
were
having
in
michigan
i
bought
two
bottles
and
i
refuse
to
touch
the
other
one
pours
a
reddish
orange
with
good
head
and
lacing
throughout
as
usual
pouring
agressively
smells
of
fruit
and
malts
i
can
sense
the
sweetness
before
tasting
taste
is
very
complex
with
cherry
raisins
and
hops
are
prevelent
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
but
not
too
much
very
drinkable
as
the
higher
abv
is
so
well
masked
almost
as
well
as
any
high
gravity
beer
i
have
ever
sampled
drinkability
is
moderate
the
abv
is
relatively
high
but
well
incorporated
and
easily
managed
the
flavor
profile
is
decent
although
its
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
run
into
a
nice
drinker
though
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
i
will
have
again
not
bad
but
not
one
of
founders
better
offerings
this
almost
seems
like
it
was
whiskey
barrel
aged
and
the
barrel
has
taken
over
considering
this
is
not
barrel
aged
that
is
a
little
off
putting
however
it
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
night
cap
and
worth
a
try
when
drinking
this
i
kept
thinking
it
would
be
a
great
beer
for
somebody
who
loves
cognac
with
its
bit
of
hotness
sweetnessloads
of
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
what
i
personally
want
from
an
drink
old
ale
as
i
like
a
little
hotness
i
will
buy
this
often
believe
this
ones
from
early
09
still
had
the
twist
off
top
and
opened
with
quite
a
pop
poured
into
a
snifter
quite
a
bit
of
floating
sediment
dark
brown
with
some
amber
highlights
head
faded
quick
and
is
remaining
only
as
a
soapy
looking
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
a
malt
bomb
on
this
one
huge
caramel
presence
some
brandy
aromas
and
a
good
booziness
the
malts
are
forefront
in
this
aroma
exceptionally
sweet
and
malty
on
the
palate
super
silky
the
silky
mouthfeel
accentuates
the
maltiness
of
this
brew
has
some
tart
flavors
as
well
almost
like
bing
cherries
big
and
sweet
but
with
an
underlying
tartness
as
stated
before
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
so
smooth
and
drinkable
must
age
well
because
from
what
i
can
tell
this
is
almost
a
year
old
im
curious
how
this
ages
there
are
some
notes
that
if
emphasized
would
render
it
undrinkable
while
others
would
make
a
delectable
curiosity
fresh
it
is
the
peer
of
many
though
not
all
british
examples
ive
sampled
probably
not
the
normal
place
to
start
my
founders
journey
but
ill
take
what
i
can
get
drinkability
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
alcohol
and
too
syrupy
to
make
it
very
drinkable
but
quite
tasty
so
its
still
very
good
i
poured
this
awful
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
the
color
of
gasoline
the
beer
poured
with
no
head
at
all
the
beer
smelled
sour
and
had
a
sour
taste
that
was
not
pleasant
at
all
little
bit
of
a
burn
to
it
and
earthy
tasting
i
will
not
buy
again
really
a
very
good
beer
that
given
a
couple
of
years
should
really
round
out
and
become
even
more
enjoyable
we
shall
see
pours
a
semiopaque
dark
rubybrown
with
a
soft
subdued
head
that
leaves
behind
little
lacing
aromas
of
honey
astringent
alcohol
boozy
and
roasted
nuts
the
taste
is
dominated
by
alcohol
and
malt
as
would
be
expected
for
this
style
hints
of
ripened
fruit
honey
and
dry
herbs
seem
to
come
out
in
the
finish
make
no
mistake
this
beer
is
all
about
sugary
spicy
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
succulent
with
plenty
left
for
me
to
enjoy
after
a
sip
the
drinkability
takes
a
hit
because
of
the
boozy
nature
of
this
beer
but
still
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
and
one
that
i
enjoy
in
the
winter
d
this
took
a
little
while
to
get
used
to
but
very
drinkable
the
slightly
higher
level
of
bitterness
helps
offset
the
sweet
syrupy
characteristics
d
this
beer
is
slightly
over
the
top
in
terms
of
sweetness
oddly
though
that
only
seems
to
add
character
of
this
brew
founders
makes
one
brew
after
another
that
push
boundaries
and
this
is
not
exception
opaque
toffeebrownish
color
with
small
head
and
little
lacing
smell
is
sweet
with
some
raisons
toffee
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
really
good
and
near
the
same
level
as
adam
dark
fruit
caramel
molasses
and
vanilla
all
make
this
one
tasty
very
creamy
and
fullbodied
delicious
a
great
sipper
that
will
warm
you
up
more
great
stuff
from
founders
considering
the
abv
the
drinkability
is
very
good
cant
wait
for
this
to
age
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
honey
and
raisins
present
the
finish
is
roasted
with
almost
a
smokiness
and
slightly
dry
and
bitter
there
is
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
in
the
background
too
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
bodied
this
one
is
worth
holding
on
to
for
a
while
i
like
it
alot
in
the
late
fall
and
winter
at
the
fire
wow
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
the
brews
coming
from
founders
but
this
may
be
the
best
i
cant
wait
to
age
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
this
is
an
old
ale
id
recommend
for
anyone
getting
into
the
style
its
abv
is
actually
moderate
for
the
style
and
it
doesnt
need
a
ton
of
age
to
go
down
smoothly
while
still
being
quite
flavorful
d
really
liked
this
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
while
not
having
too
many
would
definately
have
another
mmmm
this
beast
is
dangerously
drinkable
so
smooth
sweet
malts
are
deliciously
caramel
and
toffee
really
good
brew
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
rounds
things
out
on
the
back
end
and
there
is
a
whole
wheat
bread
yeastiness
that
comes
through
nicely
i
dont
see
how
this
could
get
too
much
better
with
more
aging
as
it
is
drinking
so
good
right
now
alcohol
is
camouflaged
so
well
barely
detectable
until
you
feel
a
little
belly
warming
pretty
amazing
beer
another
winner
from
founders
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
hazy
with
a
moderate
head
aroma
is
of
hops
with
citrus
and
fruity
notes
as
well
as
molasses
taste
is
very
sweet
molasses
and
caramel
with
a
slight
hint
of
pine
fills
the
mouth
with
a
full
flavor
but
offers
a
quick
finish
d
while
this
might
not
exactly
qualify
as
a
session
beer
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
i
think
the
high
level
of
bitterness
really
helps
offset
the
sweet
slightly
syrupy
aspects
coppery
color
with
a
thin
wisp
of
head
very
little
retention
with
pretty
much
no
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
toffee
vanilla
caramel
and
butterscotch
all
swirling
around
though
overall
it
was
leaning
towards
the
weak
side
those
aromas
show
through
in
the
flavor
that
is
heavily
toffeelike
with
a
sturdy
butterscotch
note
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
the
sweetness
was
restrained
and
i
didnt
find
it
overly
sticky
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
helped
to
lift
the
heavy
body
off
the
palate
it
was
good
overall
but
i
found
myself
wanting
more
it
lacked
a
certain
wow
factor
to
bring
it
over
the
top
but
i
was
happy
to
drink
it

taken
as

boozy
sipper
it
really
is
not
all
that
great
if
i
wanted
to
sip
on
booze
id
go
for
some
fine
bourbon
on
the

not
a
boozy
old
ale
poured
a
small
tan
head
on
top
of
a
dirty
brown
body
a
great
whiskey
and
caramel
malt
aroma
with
some
woodiness
and
roasted
malt
along
with
hints
of
berry
fruits
a
medium
body
that
passes
smooth
with
a
just
a
little
roughness
osome
type
of
oakiness
makes
it
go
down
easy
with
small
amounts
of
bready
and
roasted
malts
behind
a
large
chunk
of
sweet
malt
little
bit
of
fruity
hops
balances
this
stick
slow
sipper
and
the
abv
complements
it
with
a
dry
backbite
just
a
quality
sipper
that
is
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
and
full
bodied
and
warming
drinkability
really
enjoyed
this
four
pack
a
delicious
sipper
sweet
malty
and
delicious
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
small
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
collar
the
aroma
came
through
as
boozy
and
the
smell
of
old
wood
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
caramel
with
a
taste
of
vanilla
and
alcohol
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
when
away
as
curmudgeon
warmed
the
feel
was
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
was
reasonably
good
as
old
ales
go
not
as
good
as
adam
but
a
very
respectable
entry
from
founders
d
as
i
said
before
this
is
a
sipper
it
loses
points
in
drinkability
since
it
is
only
enjoyable
in
small
doses
my
serving
was
approx
10
oz
which
was
perfect
but
anymore
would
have
been
overwhelming
drinkability
the
flavours
are
so
incredibly
well
rounded
and
moreish
that
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
there
isnt
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
which
for
a
beer
that
almost
reaches
10
is
a
fantastic
achievement
i
love
it
d
i
really
like
this
one
cant
believe
i
have
not
reviewed
before
d
very
good
but
probably
shouldnt
be
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
complex
heavyhitting
style
of
beer
with
this
one
and
what
i
got
was
a
very
good
but
shallow
and
thin
old
ale
d
good
a
bit
boozy
and
dry
drinking
much
bigger
then
its
advertised
9
8
abv
your
not
gonna
be
drinking
to
many
of
these
at
one
time
best
sampled
by
itself
in
a
chalice
or
goblet
at
a
moderately
warm
temp
5560f
on
a
chilly
winter
night
this
is
an
excellent
beer
very
warming
but
not
overly
alcoholic
in
the
taste
anyway
it
is
well
balanced
malty
and
has
some
very
good
oak
and
whiskey
notes
it
is
pungent
and
delicious
and
therefore
one
to
be
savored
feel
and
drinkability
moderately
carbonated
and
mediumheavy
in
body
i
think
that
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
lower
and
still
this
beer
would
work
if
not
work
better
i
feel
that
the
carbonation
here
is
just
to
aggressive
the
bubbles
are
fine
in
texture
but
they
just
attack
so
vigorously
that
i
think
it
takes
away
from
the
beer
a
bit
at
first
its
fine
its
after
the
brews
been
in
the
mouth
a
bit
somewhere
around
mid
palate
that
they
all
aggressively
break
out
and
assualt
the
palate
i
think
it
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
but
by
no
means
is
this
a
fault
but
in
my
opinion
it
could
be
better
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
dangerous
especially
on
a
day
such
as
this
60
some
degrees
in
the
middle
of
summer
breezy
out
refreshing
air
the
smell
of
fall
in
the
wind
it
would
be
real
easy
to
get
real
wasted
easily
with
this
one
in
hand
ill
definitely
enjoy
the
rest
of
these
for
me
on
a
day
like
this
this
beer
is
just
as
a
good
novel
that
takes
you
away
away
from
reality
for
just
a
bit
to
escape
the
real
world
for
a
while
awesome
drinkability
a
very
fine
example
of
an
old
ale
not
quite
chewy
enough
to
be
a
barleywine
but
filled
with
complexity
conclusion
this
is
a
great
englishstyle
old
ale
its
got
absolutely
fantastic
aromas
some
really
nice
flavors
and
overall
makes
me
glad
its
getting
to
be
winter
brew
time
this
is
the
way
i
like
my
old
ales
malt
bombs
where
the
hops
stay
in
the
background
im
looking
forward
to
aging
one
or
two
of
these
and
seeing
how
it
changes
with
time
overall
good
drinkability
especially
considering
the
abv
awfully
sweet
but
still
good
the
sweetness
has
a
nice
roastytoasty
component
which
makes
it
more
interesting
some
initial
sips
are
a
tad
rough
in
the
sense
of
a
hard
liquor
swig
from
a
makers
mark
drink
yet
the
complexity
of
the
beer
especially
as
it
warms
becomes
a
warming
monster
at
9
3
abv
more
flavors
of
light
milk
chocolate
too
an
enjoyable
and
flavorful
old
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
old
ale
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
dark
and
tart
fruits
mixed
with
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
bread
a
bit
of
the
fruity
sweetness
as
well
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
nice
and
becomes
a
lovely
sipper
as
it
warms
up
saw
this
on
the
shelves
on
a
recent
trip
back
to
mi
havent
had
it
so
i
had
to
pick
it
up
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
mini
snifter
beer
is
a
clear
deep
rubyorange
color
with
a
thin
head
comprised
of
many
fine
bubbles
which
quickly
dissipates
to
just
a
thin
ring
around
the
snifter
small
bits
of
lacing
are
left
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
slightly
subdued
with
sweet
dark
fruit
like
raisins
and
figs
dominating
and
slight
fusel
alcohol
also
present
the
taste
has
another
dimension
of
fruity
complexity
slightly
sweet
with
lots
of
dextrins
bittered
almost
to
balance
but
still
slightly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
an
almost
dead
carbonation
and
a
dry
alcohol
finish
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
a
good
beer
for
a
night
cap
sitting
by
a
fire
on
a
cold
winters
evening
overall
i
cant
say
i
hate
or
love
it
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
but
only
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
sugary
a
definite
sipper
im
actually
liking
this
d
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
easily
but
it
also
gets
a
bit
cloying
so
i
cannot
recommend
it
as
having
high
drinkability
taste
strong
rye
bread
earth
and
soil
strong
alcoholic
caramel
much
flavor
thick
fruit
rum

this
is
beer
hello
d
very
which
makes
it
a
dangerous
brew
at
this
abv
overall
i
know
this
is
an
old
ale
and
thus
going
to
have
a
lot
of
alcohol
but
the
heat
is
just
to
much
for
me
i
am
slowly
sipping
on
this
one
and
it
will
take
a
while
to
finish
it
is
good
but
i
bet
a
few
years
might
do
serve
it
well
d
a
decent
brew
that
didnt
quite
live
up
to
expectations
d
this
is
a
very
nice
old
ale
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
this
one
is
a
bit
young
but
still
fantastic
i
bet
it
will
age
with
the
best
of
em
the
toughest
part
about
aging
this
beer
will
be
the
waiting
it
may
not
make
it
another
year
or
two
if
i
see
another
4pack
im
picking
one
up
d
a
decent
beer
but
old
ales
raise
my
expectations
and
this
one
didnt
really
meet
them
there
are
far
better
examples
of
the
style
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
not
something
that
will
be
on
my
list
of
keeping
around
the
house
for
the
10
99
a
four
pack
i
would
rather
be
drinking
a
dirty
bastard
for
8
99which
is
quite
delicious
by
the
way
d
a
total
malt
bomb
with
oak
to
intensify
the
effect
it
was
a
bit
much
for
me
if
you
like
whiskey
though
it
might
be
up
your
alley
i
found
this
highly
drinkable
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
and
could
have
easily
had
a
second
this
has
an
alcoholic
burn
to
it
but
its
expected
at
9
3
this
is
a
sipper
but
enjoyable
a
summary
on
this
brew
would
be
fairly
on
all
accounts
tasty
boozy
sweet
and
drinkable
rates
a
b
grade
perfectably
d
the
jurys
still
out
not
sure
how
to
rate
it
id
drink
it
again
and
i
suspect
its
better
on
tap
pours
sedimentfree
brownamber
hue
with
small
white
head
a
gorgeous
scent
of
cranberries
caramel
spice
slight
egg
nog
and
a
buttery
vanilla
cream
character
whew
tasty
stuff
that
buttery
vanilla
cream
begins
and
lingers
through
to
the
aftertaste
toffee
caramel
spice
dried
apple
skins
sweet
alcohol
seeps
through
the
thick
flavors
during
the
finish
mostly
light
carb
in
body
with
a
mildy
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
dangerously
tasty
ale
at
over
9
abv
and
wonderful
to
sit
down
with
and
consider
closely
nice
beer
the
alcohol
heat
is
the
downfall
in
terms
of
drinkability
though
worth
buying
maybe
once
a
year
but
i
wouldnt
want
it
much
more
than
that
d
this
was
a
very
surprising
brew
not
much
of
an
old
ale
it
reminded
me
of
an
english
barleywine
and
not
a
great
one
at
that
the
flavors
didnt
seem
to
flow
together
very
well
and
to
be
honest
the
whole
brew
felt
a
bet
messy
it
was
a
still
a
decent
brew
but
certainly
not
up
to
the
high
standards
i
have
for
founders
try
it
if
youre
looking
for
something
unique
but
dont
expect
an
old
ale
this
was
quite
a
disappointment
for
me
especially
since
i
love
pretty
much
everything
from
founders
and
enjoy
the
occasional
old
ale
i
will
have
to
revisit
again
in
the
future
bye
drinkability
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
in
the
sense
that
it
will
be
easy
to
have
another
some
other
day
the
combination
of
the
high
abv
and
the
sweetness
though
make
it
a
sipping
beer
and
something
to
finish
off
the
night
with
rather
than
a
beer
to
drink
during
an
evening
of
dinner
and
conversation
with
friends
note
i
also
tried
this
in
a
wine
glass
and
to
be
perfectly
honest
it
tastes
better
the
flavor
is
still
strong
but
it
doesnt
bombard
the
palate
like
it
did
in
the
pint
glass
overall
a
good
beer
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
due
to
the
abv
but
a
solid
brew
pours
a
copper
color
with
no
head
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
a
variety
of
fruit
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
this
is
a
sweet
beer
with
noticeable
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
which
makes
this
one
nicely
balanced
can
taste
pears
and
dark
fruits
medium
to
full
bodied
well
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
good
but
the
alcohol
is
more
noticeable
than
i
would
like
this
is
still
a
good
beer
which
i
would
buy
again
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
nice
brownish
orange
with
thick
offwhite
head
gthat
lingered
to
mid
glass
and
left
decenrt
lacing
nose
is
a
nice
pleasant
mix
of
malted
dark
fruit
faint
spices
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
little
thick
and
the
taste
adds
some
brown
sugar
to
the
scents
of
the
nose
long
warming
finish
tops
this
one
off
d
moderate
drinkability
abv
is
pretty
potent
not
filling
taste
is
pretty
smooth
but
does
become
dominant
on
the
palette
its
a
good
example
of
style
and
quite
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
nice
would
buy
in
winter
as
the
alchohol
would
warm
up
the
cold
and
the
sweetness
reminds
me
of
christmas
ho
ho
ho
overall
i
was
gonna
get
this
but
at
15
bucks
a
4
pack
i
backed
off
i
had
to
get
it
when
i
saw
it
on
tap
id
say
definitely
get
it
if
you
see
it
on
tap
but
dont
bother
getting
a
4
pack
unless
you
love
old
ales
another
great
beer
from
founders
i
need
to
start
doing
a
founders
collection
in
my
cellar
d
a
little
too
odd
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
is
definitely
a
weirdo
brew
for
sipping
and
picking
apart
all
of
the
crazy
rubbery
smoke
flavors
not
pint
after
pint
sessioning
this
bottle
was
a
year
or
two
old
pretty
sure
i
picked
it
up
sometime
in
2007
or
2008
delicious
ontap
poured
a
hazy
chestnut
with
a
short
creamy
head
and
some
rough
lacing
smells
sweet
with
some
brandied
eggnog
aromas
tastes
similar
very
long
flavors
sweet
and
creamy
and
rich
with
notes
of
vanilla

cinammon
and
cardomom
with
a
pleasant
boozy
note
very
creamy
and
smooth
as
well
as
rich
in
the

big
and
delicious

through

a

quite
a
tasty
beer
rather
enjoyed
it
drinkability
one
is
good
enough
for
me
to
sip
and
enjoy
this
is
an
interesting
beer
drinkability
although
it
is
hoppy
i
would
have
another
but
not
on
the
same
night
d
tastes
like
diabetes
disgustingly
sweet
and
a
drain
pour
about
halfway
through
and
this
is
from
someone
who
is
generally
to
cheap
to
waste
beer
yecch
d
a
highly
drinkable
and
good
value
old
alebarleywine
with
wellhidden
alcohol
and
succulent
sweet
notes
that
blend
together
exceptionally
smoothly
another
hit
for
founders
taste
up
front
is
sweet
malts
then
come
the
dark
fruity
flavors
the
sip
finishes
with
a
little
sticky
sweetness
and
a
warming
alcohol
presence
that
lingers
for
awhile
even
after
the
sweetness
fades
there
is
little
carbonation
in
this
mediumfull
bodied
beer
and
it
makes
a
nice
slow
sipper
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
i
would
have
guessed
thats
what
it
was
classified
as
if
i
didnt
read
it
was
an
old
ale
very
enjoyable
as
everything
from
founders
has
been
so
far
overall
one
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
quaffing
prefer
it
to
bells
third
coast
old
stock
ale
i
think
need
to
check
out
that
second
bottle
in
my
cellar
closet
pours
a
dark
orange
thick
looking
brooding
ale
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
its
malts
and
caramel
with
some
banana
and
vanilla
bean
smells
the
taste
is
strong
its
a
malt
driven
ale
with
a
strong
alcohol
taste
almost
to
me
like
a
liquor
i
detect
some
bourbon
and
toffee
its
thick
the
mouhfeel
is
full
bodied
malty
and
sweet
with
the
b4
mentioned
tastes
and
smells
founders
is
an
outstanding
brewery
with
many
on
my
rotation
this
old
ale
is
a
sipper
and
not
my
style
or
preference
all
though
i
can
tell
its
well
made
its
just
not
my
thing
low
scores
are
due
to
this
not
the
quality
of
this
ale
or
the
brewer
d
funky
for
most
and
definitely
a
sipping
beer
it
took
me
about
40
minutes
to
finish
this
and
when
i
did
my
face
felt
like
it
was
on
fire
i
want
to
get
more
of
this
gem
but
i
think
ill
wait
for
a
cold
winter
day
to
continue
enjoying
this
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
drinkability
another
good
sipping
beer
from
founders
who
continues
to
impress
me
watch
out
bells
drinkability
well
this
is
a
sipper
big
and
bold
flavors
and
bigger
alcohol
would
prevent
this
from
being
something
thats
especially
drinkable
a
great
tasting
offering
though
doesnt
quite
rank
up
there
with
the
old
stock
in
my
estimation
but
still
pretty
damn
good
tmd
this
beer
has
a
strong
bourbon
like
flavor
that
will
smash
you
in
the
balls
and
give
you
a
good
talking
too
especially
at
9
8abv
because
of
the
strength
of
this
ale
both
in
flavor
and
abv
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
that
one
too
much
to
handle
i
had
two
in
one
night
and
felt
like
i
had
been
drinking
all
day
and
night
very
strong
reviewed
on
06052009
bottle
at
pprbsg09
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
vegetal
notes
the
flavor
is
equally
gross
although
slightly
mellower
but
still
lots
of
sweet
sticky
malt
and
vegetation
this
beer
was
not
my
thing
at
all
drinkability
a
well
balanced
old
ale
this
is
very
good
for
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
if
i
am
looking
for
this
style
i
will
seek
this
one
out
one
is
about
the
max
due
to
abv
it
pours
a
orange
amber
color
with
very
minimal
head
the
nose
is
rather
interesting
im
getting
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
its
fairly
sweet
smelling
with
the
alcohol
right
there
too
the
taste
was
a
wow
it
hit
me
right
in
the
taste
buds
its
very
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
malty
carmel
flavor
with
a
good
hop
bite
the
alcohol
is
present
in
every
sip
it
seems
kind
of
thin
in
the
mouth
the
light
carb
helps
needless
to
say
this
is
a
sipper
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
nice
beer
none
the
less
drinkability
like
many
of
founders
beers
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
make
this
a
stand
alone
beer
wouldnt
want
to
ruin
the
experience
by
drinking
too
much
before
or
after
pours
a
rich
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
tightly
knit
tan
head
the
head
is
reasonable
persistent
but
does
start
to
dissipate
nicely
developing
belgian
lace
rich
winy
nose
with
hints
of
cognac
caramel
toffee
sherry
and
dried
fruits
very
moderate
but
noticeable
hoppiness
with
lingering
caramel
and
malt
notes
on
the
palate
the
roof
of
the
mouth
gets
a
sense
of
the
level
of
alcohol
however
the
alcohol
level
is
not
fully
evident
thus
caveat
bibor
is
appropriate
this
is
not
a
session
beer
or
a
vorspiel
beer
medium
body
with
a
sweet
long
lingering
this
is
a
multidimensional
old
ale
if
i
had
the
patience
and
cellar
i
would
attempt
to
age
the
old
curmudgeon
a
few
years
to
see
how
it
develops
it
should
age
well
a
great
ale
to
accompany
hearty
food
and
bbq
the
richness
and
residual
sweetness
would
also
work
well
with
spicy
food
this
poured
a
dark
clear
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
a
malty
mix
of
toffee
brown
sugar
old
honey
like
when
it
gets
really
thick
and
pasty
prunes
and
fresh
wheat
and
a
bit
of
orange
it
tasted
like
honey
wheat
toffee
raisins
and
prunes
and
a
bit
of
copper
and
orange
and
alcohol
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
old
ale
with
a
nice
malty
taste
that
was
sweet
but
not
over
the
top
it
had
good
body
too
and
kept
the
alcohol
mostly
in
check
so
this
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
fresh
but
i
can
easily
see
this
improving
with
some
age
13
years
maybe
longer
this
is
a
solid
beer
although
its
not
my
favorite
for
this
style
an
oaked
version
of
this
could
put
it
up
there
but
otherwise
its
personality
was
just
not
quite
distinct
enough
this
is
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
lots
of
sweet
flavors
decent
complexity
even
if
all
the
flavors
sans
the
wood
hit
the
same
point
on
the
tongue
have
one
with
dessert
blipped
curmudgeon
by
nirvana
overall
a
nice
beer
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
some
interesting
flavors
throughout
supremely
drinkable
given
its
size
overall
a
great
brew
i
am
going
to
immediatly
seek
out
a
case
for
the
cellar
to
see
how
this
champ
does
ruby
chestnut
brown
with
tons
of
tiny
suspended
particles
visable
slight
finger
of
fine
tan
foam
that
quickly
melts
and
leaves
very
little
lace
behind
the
nose
is
oaked
vanilla
molasses
beet
sugar
and
toffee
maltiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
complex
woody
caramelized
brown
sugar
with
a
touch
of
minty
tasting
hops
struggling
to
balance
the
high
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
mildly
carbonated
with
a
medium
heavy
bordering
on
syrupy
mouthfeel
be
careful
with
the
curmudgean
hes
a
sneaky
bastard
this
beer
is
way
to
easy
to
drink
at
9
8
oelergud
had
this
on
tap
at
the
founders
brewery
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
reddish
orange
color
very
flowery
in
the
aroma
with
caramel
and
light
vanilla
creeping
in
the
taste
was
just
amazing
coconut
and
toffee
combined
wow
later
on
molasses
and
caramel
apples
came
in
a
very
uniquely
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
chewy
a
nice
smooth
finish
a
great
night
cap
beer
or
after
dinner

founders
needs

now
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
poured
a
clear
reddish
copper
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
big
complex
aroma
of
malt
oak
and
some
hops
full
bodied
and
rich
flavors
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
from
the
oak
a
bit
hoppier
than
an
british
style
old
ale
long
finish
with
more
oak
and
chocolate
a
big
rich
flavored
beer
with
a
lot
of
different
flavors
going
on
nice
d
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
masks
the
whopping
9
8
pretty
well
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
perfect
dessert
beer
it
would
go
great
with
a
great
cameroon
wrapped
cigar
i
am
excited
to
see
how
this
will
age
considering
how
much
like
a
tawny
port
this
really
is
d
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
i
have
been
focusing
on
anything
hoppy
or
pale
for
the
most
part
and
wanted
something
malty
and
this
hit
the
spot
drinkability
a
solid
old
ale
and
even
though
for
how
little
there
are
out
there
there
are
better
ones
to
try
i
enjoyed
this
and
its
a
great
sipper
as
the
weather
gets
colder
but
either
it
needs
time
in
the
cellar
to
let
the
hops
dissipate
a
bit
or
its
just
the
tiniest
bit
out
of
whack
to
really
become
transcendent
for
which
it
has
the
potential
feel
is
pretty
spot
on
for
an
old
dense
full
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
from
the
extended
fermentation
and
high
alcohol
would
certainly
have
again
but
one
at
a
time
they
definately
keep
the
alcohol
under
wraps
on
this
one
the
sweetness
hotness
and
fruitiness
are
too
much
for
my
liking
not
bad
just
not
my
taste
drinkability
its
a
sessionable
beer
drink
it
slow
and
let
it
open
up
md
very
easy
drinker
it
just
goes
down
easily
and
leaves
a
great
aftertaste
while
i
doubt
i
would
kill
the
four
pack
it
is
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
regularly
this
beer
is
dangerous
crazy
awsome
good
medium
golden
color
with
a
tight
head
of
tan
foam
with
some
fair
lacing
the
smell
is
pretty
light
pale
malt
light
oak
not
getting
any
molasses
anywhere
here
tastes
of
pale
malt
maybe
some
dark
honey
sweetness
noticeable
but
lighter
hop
bite
almost
a
lager
type
flavor
clean
the
end
delivers
vanilla
notes
from
the
oak
very
smooth
beer
in
the
medium
body
range
overall
this
is
somewhat
simple
and
straightforward
but
at
the
same
time
complex
i
really
enjoy
the
overall
taste
of
this
one
highly
drinkable
pours
a
light
amber
with
little
head
very
little
smell
the
taste
is
unique
in
my
tasting
experience
extremely
sweet
with
very
little
bitterness
the
bottle
lists
an
abv
of
9
8
which
is
not
apparent
in
the
taste
not
boozy
at
all
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
think
this
beer
just
has
something
that
isnt
doiing
it
for
me
i
greatly
prefer
almost
every
founders
beer
ive
had
to
this
one
the
price
2
79
per
bottle
wasnt
too
bad
still
not
great
drinkability
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
i
hope
this
beers
improves
over
the
next
three
years
in
my
cellar
bottle
pours
a
good
hazy
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
the
head
last
fairly
well
for
being
thin
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
honey
and
a
big
presence
of
alcohol
almost
has
a
whiskey
like
aroma
has
a
light
carbonation
a
good
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
well
blended
and
the
alcohol
aroma
doent
hold
up
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
has
a
full
body
a
real
good
finish
and
a
good
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
beer
a
touch
strong
but
a
good
beer
d
pretty
smooth
for
a
9
3
old
ale
and
certainly
not
as
hot
as
the
abv
would
imply
while
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
this
was
one
of
the
better
old
ales
ive
had
in
my
travels
d
take
it
easy
on
this
one
i
think
its
a
one
per
night
kind
of
beer
overall
this
beer
is
nowhere
close
to
fresh
old
stock
which
i
love
but
time
might
be
on
this
ones
side
i
will
check
back
in
a
year
i
liked
this
beer
in
fact
it
was
extremely
similar
to
a
local
barleywine
we
get
called
sisyphus
in
fact
i
would
probably
need
to
have
them
side
by
side
to
probably
notice
any
differences
d
keep
it
slow
and
keep
it
easy
a
thicker
beer
but
it
is
definitely
one
that
goes
down
nose
and
easy
drinkability
very
good
old
ale
would
definitely
seek
out
and
drink
again
the
body
is
more
to
the
full
side
than
moderate
but
as
mention
before
the
mouthfell
is
a
bit
lacking
and
i
am
looking
more
some
more
depth
some
heat
and
fusel
notes
are
a
bit
of
a
distraction
the
carbonation
is
light
but
ok
overall
a
decent
barleywine
but
some
age
could
work
magic
on
this
beer
its
body
is
reddish
with
some
amber
in
there
pours
with
no
head
really
but
it
may
have
been
too
cold
smells
are
inviting
but
subdued
and
include
cherry
and
generically
estery
quite
sour
bitter
and
tart
finish
with
obvious
alcohol
cherry
and
molasses
noteness
the
sourness
is
overall
very
enjoyable
good
body
and
well
carbonated
the
fact
that
the
flavor
is
so
overpowering
diminishes
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
d
this
beer
drinks
pretty
easy
for
almost
weighing
in
10
one
of
the
biggest
charecteristics
is
the
oak
flavor
i
was
kind
of
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
its
a
good
beer
dangerously
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
have
enough
to
make
me
want
to
come
back
to
it
too
often
drinkability
is
high
wow
super
tasty
smooth
easy
drinking
a
killer
old
ale
for
sure
i
cant
believe
how
easy
drinking
this
is
with
only
a
few
months
on
its
belt
even
it
it
had
a
few
more
when
i
bought
it
its
still
probably
less
then
a
year
old
wow
great
beer
overall
eh
i
could
have
done
without
it
the
9
8
abv
i
appreciate
the
work
and
effort
that
was
put
into
this
ale
but
lets
face
it
at
this
high
of
an
alcohol
content
you
may
just
as
well
have
a
barley
wine
not
my
favorite
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
mildly
cloudy
deep
dark
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
light
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
caramelized
malts
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
rich
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
d
i
usually
take
my
time
with
big
abv
beers
but
this
went
down
without
a
hitch
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticable
in
taste
yet
the
flavors
are
just
so
full
this
becomes
too
inviting
almost
not
my
favorite
founders
beer
but
a
great
stab
at
the
old
ale
category
and
worthy
for
repeat
visits
and
slight
aging
pours
a
very
hazy
and
dark
rust
red
with
a
pretty
substantial
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
extremely
malty
sweet
and
vinous
but
boozy
at
the
same
time
taste
is
slightly
sweet
same
caramel
taste
and
light
butter
rum
it
comes
off
as
sweet
but
never
sugary
as
a
nice
warming
alcohol
takes
over
and
a
bitter
kick
gives
it
a
great
balance
i
wish
it
were
a
little
bigger
at
the
end
but
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
for
the
style
there
is
a
toffee
and
sweet
caramel
note
in
the
finish
which
is
great
the
alcohol
is
subtle
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
brown
with
a
strong
hint
of
redness
in
it
very
cloudy
and
cannot
see
through
it
no
head
retention
in
this
beer
in
aromas
there
are
cherries
as
well
as
raisins
on
the
taste
there
are
cherries
perhaps
a
slight
brown
sugar
taste
there
is
almost
a
stale
fruit
taste
but
not
in
a
bad
way
whatsoever
full
bodied
not
heavily
carbonated
but
produces
a
tingly
sensation
on
the
edge
of
the
tongue
i
actually
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
this
beer
is
9
8
but
not
a
strong
alcohol
taste
at
all
enjoy
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
strong
brew
tonight
but
one
is
enough
in
one
sitting
a
likable
old
ale
i
will
defiantly
revisit
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
very
small
tan
head
even
with
a
rigorous
pour
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
very
rich
there
are
amber
malts
dark
fruits
most
notably
black
cherries
vanilla
and
some
very
mild
piney
hops
taste
begins
with
piney
hops
more
than
the
nose
hinted
at
its
followed
by
raisinysweet
amber
malts
and
a
touch
of
whiskeybourbon
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
very
rich
and
full
bodied
very
light
on
the
carbonation
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
carbonation
though
alcohol
is
present
it
definitely
warms
you
on
the
way
down
this
is
a
pretty
intense
beer
first
that
i
have
had
of
this
style
cant
say
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
was
nice
for
a
night
when
youre
in
the
mood
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
a
beer
another
keeper
from
founders
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
that
grows
more
complex
in
aroma
and
flavor
as
it
warms
notes
a
well
made
old
ale
will
improve
over
shortterm
ageing
but
i
dont
think
its
made
to
go
for
more
than
3
years
with
improvement
i
would
like
to
see
more
hop
character
for
longer
ageing
the
hops
show
themselves
and
try
to
contain
the
huge
sweetness
but
its
just
bursting
at
the
brim
with
sugar
a
little
more
contained
than
the
smuttynose
really
old
brown
dog
though
take
this
puppy
one
sip
at
a
time
and
enjoy
not
recommended
for
the
beach
in
july
d
phenomenal
a
great
beer
that
hides
the
fact
that
its
9
3
be
careful
the
abv
on
this
sucka
will
sneak
up
on
you
and
kick
you
in
the
ass
a
very
solid
beer
but
unfortunately
it
was
in
he
company
of
some
heavyweights
and
i
dont
think
showed
its
very
best
drinkability
i
felt
this
one
and
it
was
the
only
one
i
had
had
it
been
a
weekend
night
i
would
have
had
more
than
one
i
think
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
maybe
a
little
tiny
bit
too
sweet
though
all
in
all
i
am
happy
to
have
several
more
of
these
to
enjoy
in
the
future
another
good
one
by
founders
i
think
this
might
not
be
too
fair
because
the
beer
may
have
been
poured
wrong
but
good
beer
should
be
idiotproof
the
more
i
drink
the
worse
it
gets
so
it
might
not
be
me
no
soup
for
you
nice
change
of
pace
here
in
big
hop
season
takes
the
chill
out
of
your
bones
d
compared
to
the
few
old
ales
i
have
had
this
one
goes
down
extremely
easy
no
alcohol
burn
at
all
i
could
drink
alot
of
these
sort
of
a
viscous
pour
very
little
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
looks
about
the
color
of
apple
cider
some
floaties
smell
is
a
bit
citrusy
with
sweet
malts
an
alcohol
smell
makes
quite
a
presence
also
tastes
exactly
like
scotch
maybe
a
bit
sweeter
though
not
much
to
this
one
chest
is
warmed
up
nicely
from
the
alcohol
though
this
is
the
first
founders
brew
i
probably
would
never
buy
again
notes
huge
fan
of
stock
ales
and
barleywines
this
one
is
just
how
i
like
these
styles
strong
rich
sweet
and
virtually
no
hops
12
oz
stubby
with
no
freshness
date
unfiltered

ibus
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
crimson
filled
with
floaties
and
capped
with
a
thick
finger
of
yellowed
head
very
enticing
aroma
with
raisins
and
spices
sweet
bread
caramel
brown
sugar
fruitcake
a
hint
of
diacetyl
and
suggestions
of
molasses
chocolate
and
pecans
lots
of
spicy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
balanced
by
fruity
alcohol
and
a
chewy
complex
maltiness
that
imparts
ripe
raisin
and
sweet
dark
bread
the
body
is
thick
and
coating
powdery
at
times
and
leaves
a
medium
finish
this
is
a
hugely
malty
beer
with
enough
hops
to
balance
and
makes
for
a
delicious
evening
sipper
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
in
the
nose
very
malty
with
a
nice
oak
flavor
could
be
a
nice
step
up
in
alcohol
and
hoppiness
for
lovers
of
scotch
ales
the
alcohol
and
hops
cut
through
the
very
thick
maltyness
of
this
brew
and
help
bring
it
into
balance
very
drinkable
yet
another
great
brew
from
founders
poured
an
almost
dark
orange
color
i
liked
the
way
it
looked
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
the
smell
this
being
my
first
real
old
ale
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
i
got
sweet
smells
from
all
over
the
spectrum
caramel
fruit
etc
interesting
but
a
little
cloying
fortunately
the
taste
wasnt
so
sick
yeah
it
was
intense
and
really
sweet
but
the
alcohol
cut
through
the
sweetness
just
enough
to
make
it
pretty
darn
good
all
in
all
i
wasnt
in
a
hurry
to
have
another
one
and
i
move
on
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
but
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
have
another
some
other
time
founders
is
studly
they
just
crank
out
hit
after
hit
this
brew
pours
up
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
thin
layer
of
yellowtan
head
great
lacing
baby
the
nose
is
subtle
chocolate
chip
cookies
a
little
yeast
mint
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
yeast
caramel
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
buttery
delicious
leaves
a
sticky
coating
in
your
mouth
medium
carbo
low
low
carbo
good
ol
founders
not
my
favorite
old
ale
but
it
is
still
pretty
good
i
would
like
to
see
what
it
would
be
like
with
a
bit
of
age
d
this
is
possibly
the
best
old
ale
that
ive
ever
had
it
was
sweet
and
delicious
it
only
gets
a
4
on
drinkability
because
it
is
so
sweet
and
so
potent
d
i
was
excited
to
find
this
founders
offering
and
have
generally
liked
the
old
ales
ive
come
across
but
this
one
didnt
meet
my
expectations
might
try
again
down
the
road
because
it
might
be
my
palette
but
not
a
favorite
right
now
overall
this
is
a
great
ale
i
am
not
the
biggest
bourbon
fan
but
this
one
does
it
right
thanks
again
shane
this
could
be
a
session
beer
if
youve
got
nowhere
to
go
and
yer
uconn
huskies
or
red
sox
are
one
the
plasma
a
real
smooth
finish
yet
well
balanced
and
flavorful
a
worthy
brew
that
i
hope
to
score
again
this
is
a
standout
beer
overpowered
by
the
bourbon
taste
not
much
carbonation
which
could
have
offset
the
high
abv
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle
but
alcohol
burn
very
present
cant
get
past
the
bourbon
taste
both
in
the
initial
flavor
and
aftertaste
very
much
like
old
grand
dad
founders
must
use
some
of
their
bourbon
casks
in
the
brewing
process
this
beer
is
extremely
enjoyable
and
delicious
i
couldnt
drink
many
because
of
the
abv
but
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
drinking
them
until
i
fell
out
of
my
chair
a
damn
good
beer
imho
stubby
12
oz
brown
bottle
picked
up
at
the
charleston
beer
exchange
poured
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
quickly
faded
no
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
wonderful
combination
of
vanilla
bready
malt
and
bourbon
the
taste
flavor
is
big
and
full
with
a
coying
sweetness
with
a
hints
of
smoke
brown
sugar
caramel
malts
and
whiskey
my
first
founders
and
definitely
not
my
last
a
truly
outstanding
complex
brew
well
done
impressive
old
ale
definitely
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
a
bit
muddled
at
points
and
a
bit
undefined
at
others
but
all
in
all
a
delicously
drinkable
brew
im
really
wishing
i
hadnt
just
finished
the
last
drop
this
is
one
i
could
sip
on
all
night
the
alcohol
while
strong
in
flavor
is
really
not
potent
in
a
cloying
sense
hides
relatively
well
making
this
one
solidly
drinkable
yummy
doesnt
look
like
a
great
beer
but
overall
i
want
to
drink
more
cant
get
founders
out
my
way
will
continue
to
need
to
trade
for
em
this
ones
a
sipper
though
i
probably
could
have
drank
this
all
night
if
i
was
in
the
mood
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
think
i
will
avoid
it
in
the
future
least
favorite
founders
brew
a
the
color
of
a
coppery
peach

lots
of
floating
particles
minimal

4

s
lots
of
heavy
and
ripe
fruits
smell
of

juice
aromatically
sweet
from
a
solid

but
with
some
noticeable
earthy
to
herbal
hops
4

t
hearty
malt
base
coupled
with
a
decent
hop
bite
though
you
sense
the
alcohol
it
is
very
nicely
veiled
tastes
like
a
rum
soaked
fruitcake
that
is
heavy
on
the
raisins
4

m
quite
creamy
and
medium
bodied
4

d
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
given
the
other
founders
beers
ive
sampled
but
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
beer
and
one
i
would
drink
again
4
00
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
a
year
old
bottle
as
well
and
did
enjoy
how
it
mellowed
big
sweet
malt
explosion
full
of
caramel
and
a
stronger
sense
of
that
tobaccolike
taste
i
got
from
the
nose
almost
like
coffee
except
its
a
harsher
sensation
tastes
burnt
without
that
flavor
dominating
it
adds
sort
of
an
oaked
sensation
to
it
also
reinforced
by
a
whiskeylike
bite
to
it
at
the
end
as
well
as
a
whiskeysmokeyness
after
in
the
throat
hops
bitter
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
there
for
bittering
effect
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
dont
really
add
the
taste
of
pine
or
another
particular
hop
taste
mouthful
is
thick
and
syrupy
it
coats
the
palate
and
doesnt
want
to
let
go
big
bodied
beer
a
nice
sipper
but
the
heavy
presence
of
hard
liquorsalcohol
combined
with
the
harshness
of
the
other
flavors
prevent
this
from
being
more
than
that
i
like
the
change
of
pace
but
i
dont
know
if
i
want
to
pursue
this
beer
again
at
least
fresh
the
aroma
is
complex
with
butterscotch
sourtropical
fruit
caramel
oak
and
a
touch
of
peat
the
appearance
is
dark
amber
with
a
medium
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thick
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
what
i
like
about
it
is
the
unique
mysterious
taste
did
a
vertical
tasting
with
the
06
and
the
08
and
the
fresher
08
had
more
carbonation
and
tasted
fresher
i
liked
that
one
better
d
bang
for
your
buck
with
this
delicious
beer
it
has
a
smooth
yet
complex
profile
with
plenty
of
alcohol
to
warm
you
on
a
cold
winters
night
was
glad
to
try
this
one
more
than
a
year
aged
d
notes
good
sipping
beer
smooth
and
tasty
the
beer
was
rich
yet
smooth
very
creamy
nice
bitter
aftertaste
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
not
sure
i
would
want
to
or
could
drink
too
many
at
a
time
but
probably
could
but
might
be
better
as
a
dessert
beer
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
dark
cloudy
chestnut
with
an
initially
large
creamy
head
thats
nicely
sticky
and
bubbly
dried
fruit
aromas
blend
with
caramel
and
nuts
flowers
cherries
whiskey
and
mild
spices
light
but
pleasant
like
a
dessert
i
guess
much
thicker
flavor
a
rich
fruitiness
mixes
with
a
sugary
maltiness
right
away
wine
and
bourbon
cocoa
and
coconut
vanilla
oranges
lots
of
flavor
though
quite
sweet
probably
too
much
for
me
to
want
to
grab
another
right
away
but
its
not
really
that
kind
of
beer
very
smooth
although
there
is
some
texture
to
the
fullish
body
i
like
it
a
good
quality
dessertlike
beer
even
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
think
founders
has
hit
the
mark
again
with
this
one
the
whiskey
flavors
keep
curmudgeon
from
becoming
too
much
like
an
average
syrupy
wee
heavy
d
a
little
bit
on
the
hot
side
fresh
but
still
drinkable
this
is
what
you
want
from
this
style
i
think
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
cellaring
potential
too
bad
i
only
had
the
one
bottle
drinkability
this
is
truly
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
a
well
made
complex
ale
this
is
a
winner
with
a
great
depth
of
fruit
and
earthy
notes
flavor
is
pleasant
and
unified
missing
some
of
the
alcohol
harshness
that
is
often
present
in
an
olde
ale
in
my
opinion
this
detracted
from
the
score
still
this
is
a
tasty
treat
another
great
beer
from
founders
they
just
seem
to
make
one
winner
after
another
a
clean
dark
amber
beer
has
a
small
off
white
head
there
is
a
sweet
candy
toffee
note
that
dominates
the
aroma
hiding
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
background
the
sweet
toffee
note
hits
the
tip
of
your
tongue
while
the
alcohol
sweeps
over
the
middle
the
finish
has
a
coffeetobacco
character
and
then
the
toffee
and
alcohol
join
hands
for
a
smooth
aftertaste
tastes
similarly
sweet
with
a
spiced
alcohol
finish
the
fruit
is
more
subtle
and
less
obvious
than
in
the
nose
very
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
great
all
around
founders
is
a
brewery
that
ive
been
impressed
with
and
this
is
only
first
real
review
of
one
of
their
beers
ill
be
back
with
more
pours
a
hazy
amber
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
honeyand
some
woody
tones

burbon
smooth
creamy

little
sticky
in
a
good
way
loads
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glassa
nice
warming
effect
very
good
poured
into
a
snifter
a
dark
orange
color
bordering
on
rust
with
no
foam
despite
a
hard
pour
and
no
lacing
sediment
was
left
in
the
bottle
nice
deep
aroma
of
caramel
ripe
fruits
and
light
booziness
flavor
is
a
nice
mixture
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
only
lightest
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
sweet
brown
sugary
hints
of
licorice
lightly
spicy
caramel
apple
is
a
good
comparison
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
such
a
high
abv
but
a
slight
warming
can
be
felt
as
it
warms
up
caramely
delicious
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
nice
light
copper
color
but
with
no
head
and
almost
no
lacing
strong
scent
but
its
a
hodgepodge
of
aromas
a
huge
maltiness
with
an
interesting
hop
scent
with
hints
of
cinnamon
caramel
and
jerky
as
well
as
alcohol
strong
deep
taste
but
it
has
an
odd
varnish
flavor
to
it
to
go
along
with
a
deep
pine
malt
goes
down
fine
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
roughness
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
ever
had
or
the
best
founders
although
i
would
never
turn
one
down
either
its
a
solid
brew
from
a
great
brewery
definitely
a
sipper
like
i
said
before
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
i
would
only
really
enjoy
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
also
rated
it
a
little
lower
because
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
i
guess
if
i
was
illiterate
i
would
have
sworn
this
was
a
barleywine
opposed
to
an
old
ale
even
though
they
are
similar
styles
nevertheless
a
very
good
beer
considering
booziness
and
burnt
notes
in
the
aftertaste
it
does
glide
down
pretty
easily
since
the
style
is
so
varied
i
would
say
it
fits
the
style
well
enough
an
interesting
brew
that
is
quite
good
though
getting
rid
of
burnt
edges
would
go
a
long
way
recommended
deep
ruby
brown
with
thinnish
head
murky
and
scary
big
notes
of
oak
vanilla
bourbon
and
the
like
malt
sweetness
blanketing
a
somewhat
juicy
citrusy
hop
character
underneath
holy
mother
more
of
the
same
for
the
taste
lots
of
vanilla
sweetness
to
the
point
that
its
overbearing
and
masks
the
rest
of
the
brew
a
bit
spicy
and
warming
for
sure
big
full
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
faint
burn
but
not
in
an
entirely
distracting
sort
of
way
the
bourbon
essence
is
just
too
much
for
me
i
can
handle
one
and
one
only
if
that
i
believe
there
are
better
choices
out
there
even
though
founders
doesnt
ever
really
steer
me
wrong
worth
a
try
but
a
bit
more
one
dimensional
than
i
expected
drink
is
very
tasty
a
nice
malty
beer
with
aenough
hop
to
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
a
little
syrupy
in
the
sweetness
but
very
good
i
feel
like
im
drinking
this
through
a
flavorfilter
a
9
oak
aged
old
ale
and
all
i
can
experience
is
paper
waterlogged
buttercaramel
and
grain
alcohol
its
like
that
very
last
weakest
sip
of
a
beam
of
the
rocks
drinkability
a
big
and
complex
sipper
a
little
offput
by
the
floaties
but
that
could
have
been
prevented
by
a
proper
decant
alcohol
is
very
forward
but
not
overwhelming
i
imagine
this
would
benefit
greatly
from
some
aging
and
i
may
have
to
throw
some
of
this
in
the
cellar
with
my
north
coast
old
stock
ale
interesting
second
beer
i
really
want
to
tear
into
the
next
bottle
but
i
dont
know
first
a
12
and
now
a
9
3
i
could
be
in
some
trouble
i
like
this
2008
vintage
a
fairly
clear
clear
orangeamber
pour
miniscule
off
white
head
nice
malty
aroma
increases
as
it
warms
tons
of
malt
flavor
some
toffee
brown
sugar
with
a
little
raisin
a
small
amount
of
hop
presence
nice
and
sticky
and
lingering
a
little
bit
young
i
think
i
bet
the
other
three
will
age
very
nicely
right
now
id
say
the
ola
dubh
version
ive
had
are
a
little
bit
better
but
theyre
aged
this
should
have
no
problem
competing
with
some
age
and
at
a
bargain
of
a
price
comparitively
actually
bought
a
couple
3rd
coast
old
ales
with
this
4
pack
curious
to
see
how
they
compare
even
though
they
are
considered
barley
wine
another
single
bottle
special
from
wisconsin
a
complex
beer
that
i
could
have
sworn
was
barrelaged
but
i
cant
find
anything
on
founders
site
that
says
that
it
is
quite
tasty
drinks
pretty
easy
considering
the
style
abv
dryness
this
was
on
the
verge
of
greatness
but
needed
more
body
or
aging
to
pull
it
together
pours
a
murky
deep
copper
hue
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
creamy
layer
of
foam
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
remains
clinging
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
rich
caramel
malts
molasses
and
alcohol
warm
the
nostrils
sweet
spices
and
earthy
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
as
fig
and
prunes
taste
begins
and
ends
quite
boozy
rum
dates
leather
and
gooey
caramel
to
start
things
off
in
the
mouth
followed
by
tingling
hops
toffee
and
bark
flavors
emerge
midway
finishing
with
a
lingering
vanilla
bean
sweetness
medium
body
with
a
prickly
feel
on
the
cheeks
a
tad
above
average
carbonation
for
the
style
could
be
a
bit
smoother
id
take
4th
dementia
over
this
in
a
heartbeat
but
who
wouldnt
way
better
than
last
years
batch
d
thanks
to
karlhungus
for
the
bottle
i
poured
a
12oz
bottle
medium
speed
into
a
beveled
16oz
nerax
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
out
showing
a
strikingly
perfect
color
for
my
tastes
in
a
beer
like
this
a
blend
of
brown
caramel
and
burnt
pumpkin
orange
colors
surrounded
the
glass
while
at
an
angle
looking
upwards
towards
the
thin
head
i
see
a
deeper
brown
almost
like
a
stained
mahogany
i
know
this
is
a
thick
beer
and
i
havent
had
a
taste
smell
was
of
slight
vanilla
caramel
and
raisin
no
single
smell
seemed
outright
dominant
extremely
pleasurable
smell
in
this
beer
upon
first
taste
i
am
almost
overwhelmed
first
opinion
was
that
this
was
indeed
a
thick
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
surprising
at
first
but
soon
i
adjusted
and
the
thickness
of
the
beer
was
preferred
i
soon
realized
how
wonderfully
balanced
tasting
a
beer
of
this
complexity
is
malty
to
my
tastes
but
not
in
a
bad
way
just
the
right
amount
of
caramel
and
mild
malt
balances
things
out
by
cutting
the
smack
you
get
from
the
strength
of
the
beer
this
makes
this
beer
very
very
drinkable
despite
the
punch
it
packs
im
not
100
sold
that
i
want
a
beer
with
this
much
action
in
the
mouthfeel
initial
lip
hit
tongue
fall
of
the
beer
the
followup
coating
of
the
tongue
with
thickness
of
the
malt
but
if
you
know
you
want
an
old
ale
this
has
to
come
recommended
i
think
this
is
a
solid
a
on
my
personal
scale
only
reason
i
say
it
can
improve
is
the
mouthfeel
to
me
at
this
young
age
is
still
really
thick
i
have
34
of
the
pack
down
in
the
cellar
for
aging
i
strongly
believe
this
is
a
candidate
with
some
aging
and
will
be
researching
to
see
just
how
long
people
have
been
holding
this
for
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brownamber
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
brown
sugar
toffee
with
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
of
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
and
a
hop
presence
that
is
quite
higher
than
the
aroma
indicates
there
is
also
a
nice
hot
alcohol
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
lighter
than
full
bodied
with
appropriately
low
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
old
ale
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
pours
a
cloudy
copperbrown
with
a
small
beige
head
aroma
is
sweet
raisin
caramel
cherry
nutty
light
chocolate
smoke
butterscotch
andwood
flavor
is
cherry
caramel
raisin
light
pineapple
and
light
nutty
finish
is
a
bit
hot
and
also
has
some
bourbon
notes
full
bodied
sticky
texture
low
carbonation
wow
what
a
beer
i
mean
really
what
a
beer
this
beer
pours
cloudy
and
thick
and
seems
like
its
gonna
be
some
sort
of
imperial
brown
ale
the
smell
is
really
sweet
and
smoot
and
has
a
crisp
after
effect
i
love
the
tast
of
this
beer
it
is
laced
with
vanilla
and
oak
notes
along
with
heavy
malts
caramel
malt
really
rings
out
in
this
monster
beer
its
really
smooth
too
i
love
this
beer
share
it
with
a
friend
and
enjoy
aggressively
poured
into
my
duvel
glass
this
beer
has
a
hazy
auburn
color
with
an
almost
non
existent
head
smells
fruity
and
sweet
with
caramel
and
alcohol
tastes
of
malt
and
sweet
fruit
with
honey
and
caramel
flavors
this
beer
is
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
is
nicely
carbonated
with
alcohol
at
the
end
overall
this
is
a
great
choice
from
founders
i
usually
would
not
go
for
something
as
sweet
as
this
but
i
am
loving
every
sip
of
this
one
a
must
try
another
great
one
from
founders
d
fantastic
but
very
brown
sugary
sweet
maybe
not
for
everyone
this
would
certainly
be
welcome
one
at
a
time
once
in
awhile
probably
better
off
after
dinner
rather
than
before
or
during
overall
very
sweet
with
big
doses
of
dried
fruits
and
a
big
alc
warmness
made
this
an
enjoyable

comments
i
wondering
if
a
few
months
in
the
bottle
might
take
the
remaining
edges
off
of
this
one
but
the
screwoff
cap
makes
me
hesitant
to
try
it
i
can
see
myself
getting
more
of
these
i
saw
the
bartender
pour
it
straight
from
the
tap
and
it
looked
like
he
was
pouring
a
slow
thick
molasses
into
my
pint
glass
when
the
beer
settled
i
saw
that
it
was
a
hazy
cranberry
orange
color
it
had
more
cranberry
than
orange
in
it
on
top
of
this
hazy
brew
was
a
good
12
an
inch
head
of
pure
white
foam
this
head
of
foam
had
decent
retention
that
left
behind
a
long
lasting
skim
of
white
foam
a
small
string
of
white
rings
and
one
streak
of
white
lace
the
aroma
was
no
joke
this
old
ale
was
on
the
sweet
side
with
roasted
wheat
plenty
of
sweet
black
cherries
a
touch
of
caramel
a
subtle
hint
of
grapefruit
lightly
roasted
pine
needles
and
a
few
dried
herbal
hops
at
the
end
the
taste
was
messing
around
either
the
taste
kicks
off
on
the
sweet
side
with
toasted
caramel
malts
a
speck
of
roasted
wheat
and
a
splash
of
dried
black
cherries
then
after
the
black
cherries
leave
the
tongue
the
taste
then
goes
dry
bitter
and
alcoholic
with
dried
citrus
hops
a
few
dried
citrus
fruits
quite
a
few
pine
needles
and
a
big
bite
of
alcohol
sometimes
the
hops
and
alcohol
will
mix
together
to
make
the
taste
a
little
harsh
to
drink
this
was
clearly
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
strong
full
flavored
aftertaste
of
dried
citrus
hops
black
cherries
a
gentle
touch
of
caramel
and
plenty
of
alcohol
this
strong
aftertaste
will
linger
on
for
some
time
this
beer
doesnt
even
try
to
mask
its
high
alcohol
content
it
was
a
nice
lightly
sweet
big
beer
but
like
i
said
before
it
can
get
a
little
harsh
to
drink
sometimes
be
careful
with
one
take
your
time
sipping
this
big
beer
d
the
alcohol
being
as
noticeable
as
it
was
took
away
from
this
beers
drinkability
one
would
be
great
to
sip
next
to
the
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
another
maybe
id
save
one
and
pour
it
over
my
pancakes
in
the
morning
though
eric
the
drink
is
fullbodied
with
a
tingle
of
carbonation
and
silky
feel
very
good
drinkability
for
style
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
still
fairly
easy
to
drink
d
delicious
flavor
stays
accurate
throughout
high
alcohol
in
flavor
doesnt
necessarily
translate
to
high
alcohol
in
effect
and
drinkability
a
terrific
brew
from
founders
pours
blurry
nut
brown
in
color
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
with
a
single
finger
head
that
dissipates
to
a
foamy
swirl
nose
is
deep
caramel
and
vanilla
not
much
else
going
on
here
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
slightly
woody
taste
the
alcohol
is
very
present
but
not
overly
so
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
compared
to
other
old
ales
i
have
had
drinkability
is
only
so
so
on
this
one
the
hops
seem
oddly
placed
perhaps
in
another
six
months
this
will
improve
while
starting
slow
this
one
finished
with
a
bang
technically
this
isnt
my
favorite
but
for
sure
ill
be
loading
up
my
closet
with
these
this
is
an
interesting
old
ale
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
even
better
for
me
without
the
overpowering
barrel
presence
in
the
taste
nonetheless
a
good
sipper
drinkability
it
opens
up
as
it
warms
much
more
drinkable
than
a
barleywine
it
is
a
very
fullbodied
beer
and
makes
it
known
very
good
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
drinkability
founders
continues
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
one
really
comes
into
its
own
as
it
warms
yeah
its
a
little
hot
and
could
do
with
being
laid
down
for
a
year
or
two
an
older
ale
and
the
abv
is
high
regardless
approaching
doubledigits
but
theres
a
ton
of
great
stuff
here
d
delicious
this
beer
covers
all
the
different
facets
of
the
old
ale
style
malt
presence
warming
alcohol
and
the
nuances
of
old
including
leather
and
wood
at
almost
10
this
beer
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
even
though
it
can
easily
lull
you
into
a
sense
of
pleasant
comfortability
like
a
seasoned
sailor
keeping
you
rapt
with
an
old
tale
of
the
sea
d
in
some
ways
this
reminded
me
of
a
barleywine
probably
because
of
the
caramel
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
one
good
for
the
winter
months
this
guy
is
a
sipper
on
a
cold
night
enjoyable
overall
there
is
a
really
great
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
in
the
style
another
great
beer
from
founders
i
enjoyed
this
on
a
cold
november
night
and
it
did
the
trick
of
warming
me
up
an
great
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
murky
brown
with
almost
no
head
the
little
foam
that
did
exist
was
light
tan
colored
the
smell
was
rich
malt
plumsraisins
the
taste
was
even
richer
a
little
like
a
really
strong
version
of
an
english
barleywine
lots
of
dark
fruits
mainly
raisins
and
malty
sweetness
with
a
little
alcohol
burn
thick
mouthfeel
substantial
beer
easy
to
see
why
its
rated
highly
old
ales
arent
my
favorite
theyre
good
once
in
a
while
i
pretty
much
tried
this
one
because
it
was
made
by
founders
as
usual
they
did
a
great
job
very
enjoyable
to
brew
to
enjoy
over
time
not
one
to
go
back
to
after
finishing
the
first
thanks
to
spointon
for
this
one
drinkability
a
milder
flavor
and
smell
than
im
used
to
thus
making
it
more
than
just
a
sipper
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
but
one
thats
worth
a
try
wish
there
was
a
little
more
umph
to
it
cheers
autumn
colored
ale
with
a
full
white
head
very
nice
complex
aroma
has
complexity
from
the
malt
as
well
as
the
barrel
notes
of
vanilla
creme
brulee
cookie
coconut
as
well
as
some
spice
nuances
and
barrel
character
flavor
has
some
complexity
from
the
original
beer
caramel
toffee
as
well
as
some
light
notes
of
whiskey
peat
toasted

and
vanilla
a
fairly
nice
ale
edit
tried
a
bottle
on
12282011
that
was
almost
2
years
old
very
tasty
with
subdued
alcohol
and
a
smooth
caramel
maltiness
dried
fruits
and
a
tinge
of
hops
made
for
a
wellrounded
old
ale
leagues
better
than
when
this
beer
was
fresh
had
this
on
tap
at
mike
romans
pub
in
bay
view
wi
this
thing
is
a
sipper
and
i
think
its
screaming
to
be
aged
i
will
save
one
for
some
cold
winter
night
ad
stash
some
down
in
the
cellar
ok
its
ust
a
basement
a
very
unique
style
and
one
that
i
will
have
to
play
around
with
d
certainly
an
easy
drinking
whiskey
barrel
inspired
beer
i
appreciate
that
neither
the
wood
nor
the
bourbon
flavors
overpower
the
rest
of
it
just
a
bit
thin
for
my
palate
but
still
damn
drinkable
d
reminds
me
of
candy
but
with
a
bit
bitter
finish
tasty
but
really
heavy
and
sweet
almost
cloyingly
so
md
surprisingly
not
so
heavy
full
bodied
but
carbonation
is
low
and
it
feels
light
but
still
on
the
heavy
end
of
the
spectrum
good
drinkability
delicious
beer
superb
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
my
friends
although
it
is
a
heavy
beer
it
is
excellent
for
sipping
on
cool
autumn
nights
when
the
bats
are
flying
overhead

this
beer
pours
a
muddy
amberbrown
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
does
not
hold
or
lace
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
dark
fruits
and
emerging
vanilla
and
coconut
of
bourbon
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
also
smells
of
caramel
up
front
as
the
beer
warms
some
fruitiness
comes
out
as
well
finally
the
bourbon
makes
its
presence
known
at
first
the
bourbon
was
a
bit
astringent
but
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
more
pleasant
however
the
besides
the
bourbon
i
do
not
get
a
whole
lot
else
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
low
on
carbonation
overall
it
is
an
ok
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
beyond
the
bourbon
this
was
a
very
unique
old
ale
i
would
suggest
trying
this
one
it
was
very
nice
and
warming
curmudgeon
is
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
a
wonderful
nightcap
founders
has
taken
the
old
ale
to
dizzying
heights
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
on
those
cold
winter
nights
in
front
of
a
fire
when
you
reflect
on
your
lifes
failures
curmudgeon
will
be
right
there
with
you
glaring
and
mumbling
and
somehow
making
everything
seem
a
little
bit
better
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
great
slow
paced
beer
maybe
not
for
everyone
my
girlfriend
thats
um
interesting
but
will
likely
be
a
constant
in
my
stock
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
old
ales
and
i
particularly
liked
this
one
more
than
some
of
the
others
ive
had
another
excellent
beer
from

the
alcohol
in
the
smell
crisp
clean
taste
fairly
balanced
but
actually
on
the
bitter
side
fairly
bitter
finish
but
not
overwhelming
for
its
strength
this
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
pours
a
crisp
deep
amber
almost
brown
with
no
head
just
a
ring
the
aroma
is
loads
of
malts
with
slight
underlying
hops
the
taste
is
wonderfully
complex
burnt
caramel
dried
fruits
and
molasses
all
blend
nicely
the
beer
is
slightly
heavy
but
the
alcohol
is
not
overbearing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer

it
warms

and
a

expectedflavors
are

with
is

and
balanced
a
sipping
brew
a
nice
warmer
on
a
day
like
yesterday
o
a
pleasant
sipper
quite
an
interesting
brew
and
a
bit
better
than
the
bells
third
coast
old
ale
that
i
tried
i
would
like
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
to
age
alongside
my
third
coast
and
give
both
another
try
in
a
couple
months
or
so
d
this
beer
is
not
sweet
in
a
cloying
way
which
i
expected
it
to
be
from
the
poor
its
very
well
balanced
somehow
im
not
sure
id
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
can
breeze
through
the
first
one
quite
easily
a
good
beer
a
very
good
old
ale
not
my
favorite
but
quite
close
rich
redwood
color
with
a
silky
tan
head
not
the
best
retention
but
still
a
fine
looking
ale
the
nose
has
a
collection
of
oaky
malts
smoke
cocao
and
ripe
fruits
taste
is
well
balanced
between
big
roasty
malts
sweet
residual
sugars
and
subtle
floral
hops
full
body
is
well
carbonated
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
that
i
could
drink
quite
often
d
incredibly
smooth
and
balanced
not
too
sweet
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
makes
for
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
if
it
just
looked
a
bit
prettier
this
beer
would
score
a
5
in
this
category
but
appearance
still
counts
for
me
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
still
a
fantastically
drinkable
beer
an
awesome
beer
i
actually
prefer
this
over
the
breakfast
stout
which
while
a
great
brew
is
a
little
overrated
in
my
book
for
those
that
like
oldstyle
ales
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
could
put
you
right
to
sleep
all
and
all
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
will
try
some
others
to
be
certain
d
overall
a
nice
complex
sipper
it
was
rather
good
but
i
expected
it
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
i
think
this
would
be
good
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
to
let
the
orange
peel
die
down
a
bit
it
was
rather
spicy
as
well
and
sometimes
think
that
took
a
bit
away
from
the
other
flavors
i
do
like
this
though
but
not
my
favorite
ale
think
it
would
go
well
with
some
ice
cream
or
maybe
a
brownie
old

you
overanalyze
beer
for

this
old

may
have
pushed
the
style
further
than
any
other
version
ive
had
to
date

the
other
famous

i

would
show
up
here
in

more

at

more
places
d
great
for
a
cold
winter
night
indoors
not
so
good
in
the
summer
one
is
probably
enough
its
pretty
potent
ill
be
curious
to
see
what
this
develops
into
a
very
quaffable
beer
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
because
of
the
deceptive
abv

of
a

ill
be
enjoying

mouthfeel

with
a
lighteffervescent

some
viscousness
to

but
not

so
definitely
a
sipper
but
very
pleasurable
to
drink
and
savor
as
it
warms
i
am
curious
to
see
how
this
ages
as
i
think
it
will
most
likely
improve
over
time
d
wow
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
it
is
simply
amazing
this
brew
has
a
hazy
dark

there
are
hues
of
burnt

gathers
all
of
the
best
elements
of
a
good

without
the
unpleasant
heat
and
unnecessary
hopping
of
some
which
i
acknowledge
is
a
very
controversial
viewpoint
that
many
will
not
agree
with
especially
on
the
west
coast
sweet
thick
carmel
malts
toffee
fruits
this
is
a
dessert
beer
i
want
more
i
used
to
think
i
wasnt
a
big
old
ale
fan
but
this
throws
that
idea
out
this
was
both
drinkable
and
delicious
at
over
9
alcohol
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
lot
of
the
wonderful
flavors
in
a
barrelaged
beer
minus
the
wood
for
the
smooth
mixture
of
vanilla
spiced
rum
and
fruity
malts
id
say
this
one
is
near
the
top
of
the
style

musttry
for
old

a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial

acton
ma
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
i
doubt
this
is
anything
that
i
would
really
seek
out
as
there
are
some
much
nice
examples
out
there
still
though
if
it
were
sitting
on
the
shelf
near
me
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
this
is
a
complex
beer
for
the
style
but
rather
than
the
hopmalt
balance
this
is
more
of
a
mystery
tour
of
malt
flavors
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
up
front
here
worth
a
try
i
expected
this
to
be
good
yet
it
was
much
better
than
i
had
hoped
it
really
shines
as
a
stellar
old
ale
englishstyle
barleywine
dont
miss
this
one
drinkability
was
hurt
a
bit
due
to
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
gets
a
little
harsh
towards
the
end
but
it
was
still
an
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
has
its
virtues
but
it
is
not
an
enjoyable
experience
the
appearance
is
a
nice
cloudy
amber
brown
with
lots
of
yeasty
bits
floating
about
the
head
is
off
white
retains
a
bit
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
profoundly
whisky
alcohol
dark
and
heavy
fruits
such
as
fig
rind
apricot
raisin
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
quite
syrupy
in
consistency
and
just
plain
thick
and
overly
sweet
there
is
also
an
oaky
aged
quality
to
the
beer
the
taste
mimics
the
aroma
youll
get
the
full
gamut
of
heavy
fruit
flavors
a
cloying
candied
sugar
sweetness
and
a
syrupy
thickness
that
is
just
over
the
top
and
that
oaky
aged
quality
that
is
more
apt
in
a
bourbon
the
killer
for
me
is
the
alcohol
throaty
burn
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
sweet
whisky
drink
and
it
just
burns
on
the
way
down
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
leaves
me
with
a
heartburn
afterwards
its
just
not
drinkable
as
a
beer
for
a
9
3
abv
this
tastes
like
it
is
thrice
that
much
way
too
much
alcohol
and
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
its
too
bad
because
the
beer
does
have
its
virtues
just
not
as
it
is
presently
consistituted
the
aftertaste
is
just
doing
me
in
if
i
wanted
a
sweet
whisky
concoction
i
would
have
mixed
one
myself
hv
edit
as
i
got
down
about
halfway
and
it
had
warmed
enough
it
basically
just
started
to
taste
like
rum
had
to
pour
it
out
because
it
wasnt
worth
trying
to
choke
down
only
the
second
or
third
time
i
have
had
to
pour
beer
out
very
disappointing
heavy
body
this
one
is
a
real
sipper
good
for
a
night
that
you
only
want
one
i
have
2
more
bottles
that
i
might
age
for
awhile
interested
to
see
how
this
one
ages
overall
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
it
has
some
nice
qualities
but
leaves
me
a
little
flat
in
the
end
maybe
some
aging
will
give
it
the
smoothness
to
match
the
finish
we
shall
see
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
it
d
slow
sipper
indeed
tasty
and
quaffable
id
say
night
cap
only
is
there
a
better
brewery
out
there
besides
founders
my
other
2
favorites
have
some
catching
up
to
dosurly
and
glbc
t
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
slightly
watery
in
the
finish
taste
follows
the
smell
and
borders
on
being
slightly
too
sweet
flavors
of
caramelized
dark
fruit
spices
molasses
sugar
vanilla
and
a
background
of
alcohol
also
has
a
slight
oaky
flavor
this
old
ale
is
a
little
hoppier
than
others
ive
had
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
toffee
flavors
with
an
oak
nuance
behind
it
very
cohesive
and
mellowed
it
doesnt
feel
alcoholic
at
all
caramel
and
wood
sturdy
and
balanced
age
has
worked
wonders
on
this
beast
rich
and
fairly
well
carbonated
it
has
a
divine
feel
to
it
seek
it
out
tasty
enjoyable
a
good
version
of
the
style
and
since
i
want
to
be
a
curmudgeon
some
day
this
is
a
good
one
to
get
used
to
seriously
a
little
to
strong
and
rich
for
me
a
decent
once
in
a
while
beer
maybe
in
smaller
than
12
ounce
servings
d
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
one
not
bad
but
it
just
didnt
have
that
raisin
and
fig
influence
that
i
love
in
old
ales
a
fine
old
ale
here
high
abv
9
3
is
masked
well
by
finely
blended
and
balanced
ingredients
i
could
easily
toss
back
a
few
of
these
and
not
know
what
was
going
to
hit
me
until
it
was
too
late
tasty
and
easydrinking
id
recommend
this
to
just
about
anyone
would
serve
as
a
great
social
lubricant
at
parties
and
would
go
especially
well
with
desserts
such
as
flan
or
bread
pudding
d
this
is
a
great
sipper
on
a
cool
evening
thanks
to
hoppymeal
for
this
outstanding
extra
d
wonderful
to
drink
at
the
moment
whatever
some
extra
aging
has
done
to
downgrade
the
appearance
has
been
made
up
for
in
drinkability
and
texture
wellbalanced
flavors
and
enticing
aroma
make
for
an
ale
id
love
to
sip
on
again
recommended
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
which
makes
it
enjoyable
to
drink
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissolves
to
a
fine
film
fairly
fast
solid
looking
although
the
lacing
is
fairly
nonexistent
nose
is
strong
full
of
toffee
and
caramel
some
sweet
dried
fruit
in
there
too
and
maybe
a
touch
of
spicy
hoppy
alcohol
flavor
is
spicy
and
acidic
quite
vinous
with
raisins
and
a
sort
of
acidic
aftertaste
again
principally
strong
toffee
malt
but
with
a
nice
fruity
background
as
well
a
highly
sweet
beer
and
fairly
alcoholic
the
9
3
is
fairly
well
hidden
in
the
fruit
and
spiciness
though
body
is
medium
with
very
mild
smooth
carbonation
as
is
fairly
standard
for
the
style
and
for
a
beer
this
high
in
alcohol
overall
a
very
tasty
one
although
the
abv
might
keep
me
from
having
more
than
one
or
two
a
very
good
dessert
beer
im
going
to
try
cellaring
one
and
see
if
the
spiciness
mellows
at
all
grabbed
a
single
of
this
in
cambridge
this
will
be
my
second
time
trying
this
brew
but
the
first
as
far
as
trying
it
from
the
bottle
poured
into
my
stella
glass
a
ruby
color
with
a
small
white
heading
smell
is
dominated
by
raisin
maple
syrup
molasses
and
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
is
right
along
the
same
lines
with
the
maple
syrup
and
raisins
shining
the
most
is
very
sweet
and
sugary
body
is
full
and
isnt
afraid
to
throw
its
weight
around
with
the
alcohol
it
is
there
and
you
will
know
it
after
a
bottle
great
beer
but
the
intense
flavors
and
in
your
face
alcohol
make
it
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
north
coasts
old
ale
which
is
also
quite
enjoyable
a
beer
to
sit
down
and
take
your
time
with
cheers
first
taste
already
says
this
is
a
winner
the
thick
and
creamy
but
not
too
heavy
of
a
fullness
fills
the
mouth
a
bourbon
sweetness
tickles
every
corner
but
not
to
the
extent
of
a
whiskey
sting
because
the
malts
subdue
into
an
almost
caramelized
and
soothing
throat
coat
the
back
of
the
throat
gets
a
painted
with
a
molasses
hazelnut
and
honey
coat
that
makes
some
clear
their
throat
between
sips
but
each
sip
til
the
glass
is
done
is
a
seductive
and
warm
flirt
of
a
9
5
percent
and
50
ibus
overall
plenty
of
excellent
flavors
and
aromas
to
go
around
this
would
pair
nicely
with
a
stilton
or
point
reyes
blue
cheese
good
beer
for
sure
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
some
great
lacing
decent
one
inch
head
settles
nicely
smells
just
like
a
fine
whiskey
its
seriously
one
of
the
stranger
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
putting
up
to
my
nose
i
get
a
strong
sense
of
oak
aging
and
some
caramel
not
surprisingly
this
is
just
like
sipping
a
whiskey
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
say
about
the
taste
of
the
beer
but
i
am
enjoying
the
sipping
aspect
of
it
a
different
type
of
beer
but
one
that
you
could
settle
down
to
in
the
evening
pours
beautiful
with
an
inch
and
a
half
of
light
tan
head
with
foamy
bubbles
and
nice
retention
body
is
a
ruby
brown
mix
that
beckons
to
be
drank
nose
has
a
nice
combination
of
toasted
almonds
rum
and
dark
fruits
equaling
a
very
robust
feel
enters
the
mouth
with
a
resin
like
nutty
oak
character
dark
ripe
fruits
appear
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
slight
spicyness
sparkles
on
the
tailend
of
the
palate
a
rich
spicey
thick
mouthfeel
is
the
result
sweetness
is
all
over
this
beer
and
it
is
very
bold
with
a
smokey
feel
alchol
is
well
hidden
but
the
belly
tells
you
it
is
there
drinkability
is
decent
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
very
enjoyable
i
was
not
blown
away
but
this
was
very
well
done
i
will
be
interested
to
see
how
the
other
3
age
id
love
to
cellar
one
of
these
and
see
how
it
ages
d
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
i
wondered
if
it
really
was
9
3
heather
said
it
reminded
her
of
backwoods
bastard
id
definitely
agree
this
is
much
better
than
i
remember
from
years
past
slight
fruitiness
reminiscent
of
figs
vanilla
the
character
of
which
makes
me
wonder
if
this
was
aged
on
american
oak
finishes
sweet
full
bodied
slight
carbonation
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
an
old
ale
as
a
fellow
michigander
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
founders
makes
some
great
beers
so
this
must
be
an
anomaly
it
poured
a
beautiful
dark
amber
into
my
glass
it
poured
very
dense
almost
like
syrup
which
is
very
inviting
it
foams
up
to
1
finger
then
dissipates
down
to
a
light
white
lacing
smells
is
of
vanilla
and
raw
coconut
the
coconut
flavor
overwhelms
the
smell
of
the
beer
taste
is
a
little
better
hops
then
raw
coconut
and
vanilla
followed
by
a
heavy
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
lightly
carbonated
the
coconut
flavor
of
the
beer
was
so
strong
that
this
beer
is
not
drinkable
perhaps
this
would
be
alot
better
if
it
were
better
balanced
a
wise
old
ale
indeed
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
in
terms
of
drinkability
its
a
sipper
but
a
fairly
easydrinking
one
this
brew
is
a
nice
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
hops
dried
apricots
raisens
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
somewhat
nutty
caramel
and
molasses
but
the
dominating
thing
is
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
with
a
whiskey
like
aftertaste
and
drinkability
is
fine
on
a
cool
day
this
beer
is
barleywinelike
and
will
certainly
warm
your
ears
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
revisit
overall
unexpected
the
standard
dark
fruit
flavors
of
an
old
ale
were
covered
up
entirely
by
the
alcohol
bourbon
flavor
maybe
ill
enjoy
the
next
one
more
when
i
can
see
it
coming
good
stuff
the
get
through
the
cold
michigan
winter
season
a
bit
pricey
for
a
4pack
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
small
rings
of
lacing
aroma
is
super
sweet
almost
disgustingly
so
with
some
notes
of
alcohol
taste
is
a
huge
mess
between
some
intense
sweetness
oily
texture
with
some
cloying
notes
of
alcohol
i
couldnt
find
anything
close
to
old
ale
but
more
of
an
american
barleywine
with
some
unbalance
feature
i
usually
love
product
from
this
brewery
but
this
beer
did
not
profit
from
barrelaging
curmudgeon
is
yet
another
outstanding
beer
from
michigans
best
brewery
sorry
mr
bell
there
are
very
few
beer
artisans
who
nail
each
and
every
style
like
these
guys
do
thats
why
theyre
on
my
list
of
top10
american
craft
breweries
and
will
be
for
the
foreseeable
future
if
you
want
a
delicous
old
ale
that
is
pretty
close
to
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
seek
this
one
out
cheers
beertracker
overall
i
have
gotten
into
the
old
ales
recently
and
this
one
is
a
perfect
example
i
would
like
to
get
another
and
age
it
a
bit
to
see
what
it
does
to
the
flavor
if
the
alcohol
taste
died
down
a
bit
that
would
be
a
plus
but
this
is
one
very
complex
brew
founders
is
quite
possibly
my
second
favorite
brewer
out
there
and
as
i
continue
to
taste
more
and
more
of
their
expertly
crafted
brews
such
as
this
one
they
continue
to
gain
on
stone
which
at
this
time
is
my
first
im
just
going
to
assume
this
ones
spent
some
time
in
a
bourbon
barrel
it
seems
to
be
a
good
introduction
to
barrel
beers
if
one
was
interested
makes
for
a
good
sipper
over
all
smooth
is
the
name
of
this
game
thick
silky
viscous
elixir
with
a
two
minute
finish
some
bittering
hops
on
the
end
make
you
pucker
as
well
as
a
woodsy
bourbony
flavor
that
leaves
a
wine
like
tannin
i
would
say
this
beer
easily
has
another
year
in
her
if
not
three
full
again
of
fresh
chopped
coconut
dried
cranberry
white
and
red
raisin
dates
prune
caramel
and
toffee
a
celebration
in
a
glass
nutty
mid
palate
with
a
maple
brown
sugar
twist
have
three
more
of
these
too
sample
each
of
the
next
three
years
cant
wait
drinkability
this
one
is
nicely
done
im
assuming
that
these
would
probably
have
a
decent
shelf
life
too
d
the
ales
abv
is
high
but
the
intense
flavors
create
a
beer
that
never
disappoints
in
its
power
are
you
sure
it
isnt
aged
in
a
barrel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
viscous
with
a
middle
of
the
road
carbonation
that
suits
the
beer
well
it
grabs
on
nicely
while
still
finishing
clean
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
i
could
see
myself
indulging
in
a
couple
in
a
sitting
for
sure
and
i
plan
on
buying
another
four
pack
if
i
see
it
available
founders
has
impressed
me
again
with
this
one
d
for
an
old
ale
at
9
3
this
is
quite
nice
a
good
sipping
beer
for
a
lazy
afternoon
or
an
after
dinner
treat
recommended
d
i
like
it
id
say
for
9
3
percent
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these

but

this
ale
has
a
wonderul
bourbon
whiskey
flavor
as
much
as
you
could
possibly
want
yet
without
coming
across
as
a
whiskey
wannabe
its
an
ale
all
the
way
additional

im
a
variety
lover
yet
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
feel
like
i
could
enjoy
every
day
another
great
one
from
a
great
brewery
pours
a

is
of
pure
bourbon
vanilla
oak
malt
and
sweet
its
all
there
if
i
hadnt
poured
this
out
of
a
small
bottle
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
a
bourbon
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
strong
oaky
little
to
no
carbonation
this
is
a
great
after
dinner
sipping
beer
couldnt
really
imagine
having
more
than
one
of
these
but
i
will
definitely
enjoy
the
one
that
i
have
i
had
this
about
1
year
ago
and
it
was
very
sweet
and
tasted
like
bubblegum
it
has
aged
into
a
sweet
but
not
cloying
beer
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
cheers
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
notes
figs
and
raisins
are
the
first
to
cross
the
taste
buds
bourbon
barrel
notes
are
noticeable
but
subtle
like
coconut
flavors
with
a
sweet
softness
citrus
fruit
notes
arent
very
big
but
are
noticeable
as
the
brew
warms
up
a
bit
nice
spicy
alcohol
laden
thickness
like
that
of
a
cloud
emanates
from
the
walls
of
the
mouth
smooth
mouthfeel
booze
is
very
present
but
not
the
main
playerits
big
but
still
subdued
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
one
that
im
thankful
for
getting
the
chance
to
try

could
sip
this
for
hours
received
this
in
a
trade
i
really
like
this
style
but
have
a
hard
time
destinguishing
the
difference
between
old
ale
and
an
english
barleywine
this
is
a
fantastic
way
to
officially
end
the
work
day
and
move
on
into
getting
dinner
ready
for
the
family
i
had
no
expectations
in
diggin
in
to
this
brew
but
am
pretty
impressed
in
its
relative
simplicity
and
drinkability
thanks
vance
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
just
the
right
amount
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
to
make
them
obvious
but
not
overpowering
and
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
either
exactly
what
an
old
ale
should
be
thick
creamy
and
sweet
one
of
the
best
out
there
hazy
caramel
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
as
the
foam
settled
to
a
ring
of
fine
bubbles
it
left
some
spotty
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
quite
complex
with
wood
and
vanilla
up
front
some
caramel
plenty
of
fruit
grapes
orange
marmalade
and
a
little
alcohol
mild
bitterness
when
compared
to
the
sweetness
with
caramel
and
toffee
center
stage
some
oak
and
raisin
notes
were
present
as
well
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
had
a
soft
finish
with
a
refined
fruitiness
full
bodied
with
lightish
carbonation
some
creaminess
yet
still
a
bit
dry
this
was
really
interesting
and
highly
drinkable
it
had
plenty
of
character
almost
like
tasting
a
different
beer
with
each
sip
d
a
good
hearty
old
ale
the
9
3
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
but
another
strong
offering
from
founders
prost
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
color
quick
fizzy
head
nice
carbonation
left
some
little
islands
around
the
nose
is
of
malts
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
taste
is
sweet
slightly
malty
very
much
bourbon
nice
touch
of
vanilla
medium
body
drinkable
quite
a
different
old
ale
but
very
tasty
highly
recommended
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
very
rich
big
ale
the
big
body
and
waming
effect
due
to
the
alcohol
make
this
a
perfect
choice
for
a
cool
winter
night
may
be
a
little
too
rich
to
be
sessionable
but
might
be
fun
to
try
will
definately
be
enjoying
this
tasty
treat
again
poured
with
very
little
head
and
a
ton
of
floaties
initial
smell
of
sulphur
raisins
molasses
brown
sugar
very
smooth
brew
very
velvety
definite
barley
wine
qualities
to
ths
one
with
a
lacing
that
runs
the
whole
glass
drinkable
but
i
would
not
have
2
or
3
i
would
stick
with
one
and
move
on
a
great
beer
though
pleasant
beer
worth
trying
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
old
ale
by
far
thanks
again
to
mabz
for
this
and
the
other
beers
he
recently
sent
d
im
not
a
fan
but
it
is
something
i
can
handle
it
isnt
a
terribly
unpleasant
experience
either
it
just
isnt
for
me
i
wont
have
this
again
the
closest
beer
i
can
think
to
compare
this
to
is
averys
samaels
oak
aged
ale
this
doesnt
come
close
in
pleasantness
though
it
lacks
all
the
pleasant
fruit
flavors
and
has
a
shitload
of
butter
it
also
reminds
me
a
bit
of
weyerbachers
prophecy
but
not
as
offensive
at
least
in
my
opnion
anyway
this
is
just
way
too
buttery
throughout
if
you
like
drinking
bourbon
butter
then
drink
this
otherwise
avoid
it
the
pour
creates
a
huge
thick
crop
of
nicotine
stained
beige
head
the
retention
of
the
oversized
head
is
very
good
the
body
of
the
beer
is
scarlet
red
aroma
is
a
bit
toxic
and
fruity
like
spiked
punch
the
taste
it
turns
out
is
not
toxic
at
all
rather
smooth
and
velvety
very
nice
taste
very
little
sign
of
alcohol
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
solid
old
ale
malts
are
so
smooth
on
the
palate
fruitiness
is
very
evident
but
not
overly
estery
in
nature
bits
of
caramel
and
toffee
this
one
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
and
finished
fabulously
highly
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
founders
beers
ive
hadand
that
says
a
lot
d
very
nice
and
tasty
i
love
me
bourbon
aged
beers
but
with
23
years
under
its
belt
this
beer
would
be
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
most
beers
of
this
caliber
get
very
cloying
after
a
period
of
time
this
one
doesnt
i
would
actual
consider
drinking
another
one
of
these
right
now
this
is
really
good
but
its
a
sipper
at
9
3
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
rich
mildly
carbonated
i
found
this
one
to
be
filling
and
too
bourbonlike
for
my
beer
drinking
tastes
to
it
drink
regularly
d
dont
like
this
at
all
and
dont
see
me
making
it
all
the
way
through
it
pours
out
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
small
head
of
tiny
bubbles
whats
there
looks
creamy
wooee
a
potent
sweet
alcohol
aroma
socks
me
in
the
nose
smells
oily
with
caramel
notes
and
a
little
banana
too
a
little
like
southern
comfort
the
taste
packs
a
punch
too
the
caramel
is
there
along
with
alcohol
and
not
much
bitterness
just
a
little
in
the
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
its
good
creamy
smooth
and
thick
nice
this
was
a
good
brew
but
the
high
alcohol
and
the
powerful
presence
of
it
would
make
it
hard
to
down
more
than
one
of
these
im
still
reeling
some
overall
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
out
of
this
world
the
malt
is
showcased
very
admireably
but
well
balanced
very
light
feeling
for
such
a
strong
abv
i
want
another
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
big
complex
woody
flavor
and
will
be
great
with
some
age
poured
a
thick
cloudy
auburn
brown
with
little
or
no
head
to
speak
of
leaves
the
faintest
little
beige
ring
of
sticky
lace
moderate
sediment
floats
about
can
be
seen
with
a
reddish
hue
when
held
to
the
light
smells
deeply
of
sweet
maltgrain
dark
ripened
fruits
earthen
notes
walnuts
taste
is
also
sweet
and
malty
resinous
woodiness
and
nutty
figs
and
dates
along
with
brown
sugary
alcohol
flavor
leaves
a
slightly
drying
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
very
low
levels
of
carbonation
viscous
syrupy
like
smoothness
drinkability
is
decent
a
little
too
sweet
all
around
nice
level
of
complexity
pairs
with
a
hard
to
detect
9
3
abv
not
a
bad
old
ale
but
ive
had
better
recommend
trying
ripe
full
with
complexity
but
not
sure
what
else
to
say
bourbon
is
so
dominant
leads
to
a
strong
taste
despite
alcohol
being
rather
quiet
a
sticky
toffee
finish
above
all
bourbon
big
thanks
to
hogtownharry
a
great
finish
to
a
fantastic
tasting
tasty
this
beer
is
best
suited
as
a
sipper
and
a
nightcap
i
think
as
it
is
a
slightly
agressive
beer
flavorwise
rich
and
im
sure
the
abv
would
catch
up
to
one
rather
quickly
this
is
an
extremely
complex
old
ale
sweeter
than
most
and
i
love
it
taste
starts
out
pretty
sweet
and
fruity
with
cherries
and
dates
and
then
the
oak
barrel
and
boozey
flavors
almost
vinous
make
a
significant
appearance
the
vanilla
is
there
but
im
picking
up
some
coconut
that
wasnt
present
in
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
a
peppery
spiciness
finished
sweet
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
dinkability
is
good
for
the
style
and
abv
but
you
still
wouldnt
want
to
be
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
nght
my
sample
was
fairly
young
but
i
bet
some
time
in
the
cellar
would
really
mellow
this
and
bring
out
even
more
complexity
sweetness
succeeds
in
the
end
emboldened
by
the
great
fruity
flavor
and
matched
up
with
the
booze
i
love
it
thats
a
fine
compliment
from
one
curmudgeon
to
another
drinkability
is
alright
for
the
style
i
would
never
sit
down
to
a
few
of
these
it
is
more
of
a
hit
and
run
type
and
nobody
would
likely
dispute
that
so
for
a
single
serve
i
say
what
the
hell
this
is
decent
you
will
not
catch
me
filling
my
jug
with
this
but
as
an
adventurous
beer
drinker
it
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
of
barbarian
blood
and
you
enjoy
a
drink
such
as
old
ale
well
step
on
up
you
will
most
likely
enjoy
this
creation
what
can
i
say
another
great
brew
from
founders
that
ive
gotten
to
experience
on
draft
12
oz
stubby
i
had
this
one
a
while
ago
and
thought
it
needed
some
time
so
well
see
where
it
falls
now
it
pours
a
deep
deep
tea
brown
color
with
golden
to
amber
highlites
a
light
head
falls
to
an
almost
full
coat
over
top
with
a
solid
ring
what
i
expected
the
aroma
brings
lots
of
malt
there
are
incredibly
deep
caramel
tones
with
a
kiss
of
raisin
fruityness
and
brown
sugar
this
definately
is
focused
on
the
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
fruityness
being
in
the
background
i
like
it
there
is
a
light
kiss
of
alcohol
in
there
too
but
it
adds
a
light
spiceyness
as
opposed
to
a
boozeyness
flavors
are
along
the
lines
of
the
nose
i
find
deep
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
moderate
earthy
hop
playing
well
with
it
there
is
a
modest
bitter
on
the
finish
with
a
fairly
prominent
puff
of
alcohol
that
hits
in
my
nostrils
again
this
is
not
offensive
but
just
present
there
is
a
nice
solidness
about
the
flavor
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
call
it
deep
the
feel
is
thick
with
a
light
slickness
and
a
very
light
carbonation
im
not
a
fan
of
the
slickness
it
pulls
a
little
bit
of
the
thick
feel
away
from
the
beer
this
one
definately
carries
the
9
with
it
i
will
sip
this
over
the
next
hour
or
so
and
i
wont
be
having
anything
more
after
it
i
enjoy
the
flavors
and
aromas
i
think
there
is
a
little
more
blending
that
will
happen
after
another
6
months
with
this
one
thanks
go
to
redbaron
for
the
bottle
editjust
finished
beer
20
minutes
after
starting
review
and
it
really
came
into
its
own
as
it
warmed
a
lot
of
the
vinuous
and
alcohol
bite
had
mellowed
and
it
was
quite
pleasant
tastes
boozy
and
malty
there
are
dark
fruits
muddled
in
rum
some
woody
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
lightly
carbonated
the
filling
nature
of
this
beer
is
the
only
thing
that
limits
its
drinkability
for
me
theres
no
head
with
little
lacing
that
doesnt
stick
very
well
the
smell
is
sweet
brown
with
butterscotch
its
pungent
like
perfume
very
very
sweet
perfume
it
also
has
a
slight
spicyness
its
like
wetsweet
wood
or
cardboard
with
a
sweet
sweet
brown
sugar
with
spices
mouthfeel
is
a
little
smooth
with
some
good
carbonation
i
wouldnt
have
another
unless
it
was
fresh
only
because
i
was
told
it
was
great
pours
dark
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
very
small
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
back
aroma
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
there
is
just
the
faintest
hint
of
raisins
but
i
mainly
get
a
sweet
maltiness
with
some
boozy
alcohol
not
bad
just
not
overly
complex
taste
follows
suit
although
has
a
little
more
going
on
there
is
a
sweet
graperaisin
flavor
along
with
nice
sugary
caramel
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
evident
and
nicely
warms
the
back
of
the
throat
on
the
first
couple
sips
medium
sugary
body
is
well
balanced
by
a
lightly
spicy
alcohol
presence
and
a
decently
dry
finish
sampled
at
the
odds
and
ends

rich

comments

thanks
to
my
good
friend
and
temporary
landlord
skyhand
for
putting
me
up
for
a
few
nights
while
i
was
in
town
and
feeding
me
this
exceptional
dessert
taste
pretty
darkly
yet
portly
vinous
pretty
good
combination
of
malty
sweet
and
viney
tart
the
currant
like
flavors
mix
well
with
some
red
malts
and
prunes
that
better
define
the
sweetness
a
very
nice
old
ale
fulfilling
and
dreamy
brown
and
thicklooking
small
head
that
receeds
to
just
a
coating
of
small
bubbles
looks
like
a
glass
of
watered
down
maple
syrup
sweet
odor
with
hints
of
chocolate
bars
ginger
pine
toffee
oak
ethanol
and
dates
very
delicious
taste
sweetness
is
the
first
flavor
along
with
kind
of
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
but
this
quickly
mellows
to
a
fantastic
mix
of
chocolate
cherries
oak
dates
and
a
fudgeycaramelly
blend
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
way
to
go
again
founders
im
looking
forward
to
my
first
breakfast
stout
and
my
second
kentucky
breakfast
both
of
which
are
burning
holes
in
my
dbf
drinkability
nice
rich
and
boozy
with
great
malts
and
a
nice
biting
finish
definitely
a
beer
that
ill
come
back
to
particularly
as
the
weather
turns
colder
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
tan
head
over
the
cloudy
reddish
brown
brew
head
quickly
fades
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
and
lacing
is
average
both
somewhat
expected
for
the
style
aroma
is
vanilla
oaky
alcohol
possibly
over
the
top
but
the
variety
of
flavors
is
enough
to
possibly
overcome
the
somewhat
exceptional
intensity
taste
is
also
vanilla
and
oak
with
strong
alcohol
throughout
and
a
warming
close
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
a
malt
sweetness
background
to
support
all
the
strong
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
even
if
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
by
the
flavor
harshness
in
my
mind
age
might
help
this
mellow
a
bit
and
make
a
winner
overall
a
wonderful
beer
flavorful
complex
and
worth
buying
another
even
at
its
steep
price
tag
of
3
79
i
cant
really
ask
for
more
the
weakness
is
really
the
cost
15
for
a
four
pack
if
it
were
cheaper
it
would
make
it
into
my
daily
rotation
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
more
drinkable
but
that
would
probably
take
away
from
the
wonder
that
is
this
beer
founders
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
an
ole
ale
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
something
from
founders
so
i
killed
two
proverbial
birds
with
one
proverbial
stone
im
now
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
both
this
is
a
unique
ale
that
exotic
sweetness
will
have
you
tasting
things
you
dont
usually
get
in
beer
to
my
senses
pineapple
and
watermelon
liqueur
but
it
maintains
good
balance
and
depth
too
glad
to
have
experienced
this
one
thanks
to
ba
jabocu
for
the
trade
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
i
would
recommend
aging
this
one
out
for
a
while
it
isnt
bad
right
now
but
i
definately
thing
it
would
improve
over
time
thanks
to
flyingbison
for
this
curmudgeon
i
always
feel
bad
when
i
rate
an
old
ale
that
isnt
very
old
but
since
it
is
on
the
shelves
i
will
drink
and
i
will
rate
gulp
yep
it
needs
more
time
there
are
some
really
nice
flavors
going
on
but
the
beer
is
everywhere
the
nose
brings
out
everything
from
candied
malts
to
spicy
hops
to
dark
fruits
to
caugh
syrup
the
tastes
closely
mimic
the
aromas
but
with
emphasis
on
a
candy
sweetness
harsh
alcohols
and
raisons
and
licorice
the
beer
feels
a
bit
too
hot
and
scrubbing
in
the
mouth
with
sugary
stickiness
it
will
be
nice
to
see
how
the
beer
develops
over
the
next
year
or
two
but
its
not
ready
yet
thanks
clvand0
for
the
bottle
this
is
my
first
beer
where
i
said
whoa
this
really
needs
to
mellow
out
a
bit
the
alcohol
was
just
intense
and
the
flavors
took
some
time
and
warmer
temperature
to
escape
i
really
did
enjoy
this
but
even
more
importantly
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
and
again
and
again
pours
thick
and
coffee
colored
with
minimal
head
bright
mahogany
highlights
assertive
aroma
of
bourbonvanilla
and
chocolatecovered
bananas
sumptuous
hits
the
palate
with
authority
bourbon
vanilla
bananas
again
along
with
sweet
cream
and
coffee
all
make
appearances
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
shows
up
in
the
finish
very
thick
on
the
palate
as
one
would
expect
quite
rich
flavorful
interesting
old
ale
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
american
microbrewed
old
ales
big
big
beer
a
mistake
on
this
evening
parked
in
front
of
a
fan
while
braving
the
last
of
a
humid
90degree
day
but
dont
go
far
old
man
i
will
be
looking
for
you
the
moment
the
snow
falls
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
dont
like
the
nutmeg
note
at
all
and
it
loses
a
point
for
that
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
one
in
another
year
or
two
and
seeing
how
it
matures
recommended
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
the
style
kickass
12
ounce
bottle
old
curmudgeon
pours
out
a
hazy
brown
color
topped
with
a
medium
sized
head
the
aroma
is
tropical
fruits
dates
spices
and
bourbon
characteristics
like
oak
vanilla
and
coconut
sweet
malty
flavor
with
lots
of
coconut
and
fruit
finishes
harsh
and
metallic
perhaps
this
beer
could
use
some
aging
to
mellow
it
a
bit
the
flavor
is
spicier
than
i
like
but
its
still
a
good
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
decent
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
with
all
the
quality
old
ales
and
barleywines
out
there
there
are
better
choices
aroma
is
pineapple
heavily
accented
liquor
that
i
assume
is
bourbon
but
could
pass
for
rum
in
a
crowded
bar
the
aroma
is
quite
unusual
though
and
curiously
it
is
more
easily
discerned
sniffing
from
the
bottle
than
from
my
snifter
in
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
heavily
bourbon
with
some
pineapple
understones
in
the
glass
the
two
mesh
equally
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
lays
beneath
the
body
is
opaque
and
brownamber
in
color
it
had
a
head
the
size
of
a
quarter
but
only
very
briefly
the
fore
is
a
blast
of
smooth
sweet
malts
and
bourbon
lots
of
bourbon
oak
vanilla
combining
to
coconut
and
the
faintest
traces
of
sweet
tropical
fruits
follow
i
want
to
know
where
these
bourbon
barrels
came
from
tastes
a
lot
like
a
a
bourbon
with
melted
ice
but
the
thick
palate
and
smooth
malt
undertones
keep
it
from
getting
too
far
down
the
road
away
from
the
realm
of
beer
its
a
heady
drink
and
i
swear
i
get
a
lingering
pineapple
malibu
rum
flavor
in
the
far
aftertase
a
sipper
for
sure
this
poured
an
amber
brown
that
was
a
little
hazy
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
evaporated
rather
quickly
the
aroma
was
a
swift
kick
in
face
scotch
and
malt
the
taste
was
a
little
more
complex
like
a
good
scotch
there
were
hints
of
vanilla
dark
fruit
and
whiskey
barrel
aged
flavor
that
was
unexpectedly
amazing
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
full
with
little
carbonation
this
is
absolutely
a
beer
to
be
sipped
with
the
flavors
and
high
alcohol
presence
one
could
easily
forget
that
this
is
beer
and
not
scotchwhiskey
fantastic
old
ale
smooth
and
light
carbonation
strange
release
date
though
would
age
nicely
wow
what
an
amazing
beer
i
dig
the
oak
aged
thing
but
this
by
far
one
of
the
best
its
so
well
balanced
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
an
interesting
beer
and
one
with
some
interesting
flavors
going
on
alcohol
is
apparent
throughout
the
sample
but
this
remains
a
good
sipper
i
enjoyed
it
but
for
the
retail
price
in
ma
will
probably
be
unlikely
to
by
it
in
the
store
drinkability
pretty
good
pours
out
to
a
tea
like
hazy
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
of
tan
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
aromas
of
whiskey
malt
vanilla
fermented
grain
earth
nice
taste
is
fair
complex
notes
of
whiskey
and
wood
with
hints
of
burnt
malts
permeate
the
palate
touches
of
raw
grain
and
vanilla
are
noted
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
heavy
drinkabilty
is
fair
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
the
bourbon
flavors
are
too
overpowering
making
this
more
of
a
liquor
like
experience
than
a
beer
like
experience
what
do
i
think
overall
tough
call
like
a
stinky
old
man
you
have
to
respect
the
work
that
went
into
its
culmination
regardless
of
how
gritty
his
current
situation
might
be
recommended
oddly
wouldnt
drink
too
many
in
a
sitting
tastes
gentle
oaky
on
a
nice
malt
sweet
vanilla
and
caramel
a
touch
of
sherry
oranges
and
cherry
simple
sweet
and
tasty
gentle
and
clean
alcohol
sting
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
and
almost
no
carbonation
nothing
special
just
a
solid
offering
interesting
though
it
may
be
im
not
sure
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
as
we
can
perhaps
discern
from
the
label
this
is
an
unapologetic
strong
beer
it
pours
a
dense
cloudy
brown
color
and
has
an
oaky
almost
scotchlike
scent
it
tastes
like
an
english
ale
with
a
dollop
of
good
whisky
although
it
has
a
certain
pervasive
boozy
flavor
one
that
is
certainly
somewhat
unbalanced
its
appropriate
for
the
style
this
is
a
fullbodied
beer
almost
to
the
point
of
chewiness
its
not
what
id
call
eminently
drinkable
because
of
its
kick
i
found
myself
sipping
it
absently
like
a
neat
whisky
founders
really
gets
their
flavors
out
strong
and
this
bourbon
beer
is
no
exception
some
good
complexity
but
end
the
end
the
bourbon
dominates
if
you
like
bourbon
try
this
if
not
dont
slàinte
this
one
really
shows
a
lot
of
complexity
at
room
temperature
very
nice
sipper
the
smokiness
evokes
the
taste
of
burning
a
caramel
apple
over
an
outdoor
campfire
deep
in
the
upper
penninsula
woods
age
a
few
of
these
and
save
for
deep
winter
youll
be
glad
you
did
a
sipper
fo
sho
because
it
is
so
thick
and
slightly
syrupy
would
probably
age
wonderfully
great
stuff
founders
has
not
dissapointed
me
yet
with
their
beers
ranging
from
solid
to
excellent
good
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
present
but
never
burns
or
becomes
abrasive
it
just
stays
pleasant
and
warming
d
this
is
a
good
one
to
sip
on
a
little
over
the
top
on
the
bourbon
taste
but
pretty
good
should
probably
let
sit
for
a
year
to
mellow
out
the
taste
i
think
i
will
go
buy
some
more
before
its
too
late
and
let
it
sit
in
my
cellar
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
fancies
high
gravity
beer
with
that
fantastic
bourbon
creme
taste
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
with
large
bubbles
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
strong
bourbon
aromas
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
flavors
a
bit
to
strong
for
me
full
bodied
with
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
the
whiskey
flavor
is
about
all
i
get
from
this
d
wow
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
for
awhile
not
knowing
what
to
expect
this
is
truly
great
its
very
drinkable
to
me
this
is
a
delightful
suprise
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
pours
a
nearly
opaque
dark
garnetamber
with
an
afterthought
of
offwhite
head
nose
and
taste
start
off
with
what
my
roommates
and
i
could
only
describe
as
malibu
rum
buttressed
by
warm
vanilla
and
oaky
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
substantial
almost
chewy
and
reflective
of
the
complexity
of
flavors
within
probably
a
one
and
done
for
me
but
a
nice
sipper
while
playing
darts
at
the
come
back
and
a
steal

drinkability
not
at
all
i
do
not

overall
impression
drain

glad
i
bought
a
single
would
someone
please
stop
the
barrelaging
overoaked
overbourboned
silliness
its
tired
and
it
does
nothing
to
showcase
a
brewers
talent
or
anything
that
fine
beer
ingredients
can
provide
in
terms
of
flavor
avoid
from
the
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
left
no
lacing
aroma
just
like
the
description
says
aged
on
bourbon
barrels
and
the
boubron
comes
out
nice
and
strong
than
some
sweetness
along
with
the
malts
couldnt
get
anything
else
out
of
it
after
it
warms
the
aroma
subsides
a
bet
flavor
the
bourbon
was
as
strong
as
the
aroma
which
was
a
could
thing
than
along
came
the
malts
and
sweetness
got
molasses
and
some
dark
fruits
became
easier
to
drink

very
quick
aroma
is
very
vinous
notes
of
oak
coconut
and
vanilla
almost
sherry
like
in
flavor
the
oak
flavor
is
very
strong
and
may
need
to
mellow
out
a
bit
alcohol
is
well
hidden
until
this
warms
to
room
temperature
a
hint
of
spices
as
it
warms
as
well
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
but
all
seems
to
be
overshadowed
by
the
woody
aspect
of
this
beer
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
bad
but
i
think
some
cellar
time
could
make
this
an
outstanding
beer
very
complex
and
interesting
certainly
worth
revisiting
in
the
future
i
want
some
for
my
cellar
not
my
favorite
founders
brew
still
a
nice
offering
altogether
it
not
my
favorite
founders
a
complex
beer
in
flavor
though
and
well
crafted
a
sipper
just
a
little
too
much
like
whiskey
for
my
liking
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
3
more
in
the
cellar
cant
wait
to
see
how
they
taste
with
some
age
the
bottom
line
a
nice
effort
by
founders
truly
distinct
from
the
other
old
ales
that
are
out
there
with
a
beautiful
oak
cask
flavour
that
is
worth
trying
out
one
of
my
favourites
from
founders
and
ive
had
most
of
their
portfolio
on
multiple
occasions
in
terms
of
its
style
its
my
favourite
domestic
offering
and
the
taste
chracteristics
here
are
almost
scotch
like
in
certain
ways
which
is
of
course
excellent
if
you
like
ole
ales
you
must
try
this
i
could
see
this
being
a
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
i
happen
to
love
it
and
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
couple
four
packs
pours
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
tons
of
ruby
highlights
a
small
cream
colored
head
forms
but
leaves
quickly
leaving
some
spotty
lacing
very
hazy
this
beer
reminds
me
of
jolly
pumpkins
biere
de
mars
but
heavier
on
the
alcohol
boozy
oaky
malts
are
the
aromas
that
really
jump
out
at
you
some
tropical
fruit
smells
and
spices
are
also
swirling
around
taste
mimics
the
smell
heavy
on
the
malts
oak
and
booze
finishes
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
semi
sweet
to
me
a
complex
beer
that
reveals
more
as
it
warms
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
kinda
heavy
a
definite
sipper
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
might
take
some
time
for
this
one
to
grow
on
people
i
have
a
couple
bottles
to
age
and
compare
notes
give
this
one
a
shot
another
great
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
edit
i
stopped
swirling
for
two
minutes
and
the
urine
is
back
good
good
good
i
cant
see
myself
reaching
back
into
the
cooler
to
get
another
fix
like
the
good
old
kentucky

made
me
do
several
times
but
this
here
is
good
stuff

abv
is
apparent
but
not
inappropriately
so
rich
full
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
assertive
this
is
really
tasty
stuff
but
the
alcohol
strength
is
definitely
of
the
asskicking
variety
id
love
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
it
would
require
that
i
have
a
dd
top
notch
ontap
at
pizza
plant
transit
it
was
so
good
it
was
as
if
it
was
brewed
right
here
dark
boddy
with
thin
head
stouty
roast
aroma
hoppy
and
spicy
mediumfull
body
i
like
the
style
its
more
drinkable
than
a
barleywine
the
understated
carbonation
at
this
location
does
it
justice
drinkability
the
good
malty
base
rich
fruity
sweet
combo
and
nice
toasty
tang
make
this
a
very
tasty
brew
the
waitressbarmaid
told
me
this
was
a
brown
ale
but
perhaps
she
was
mistaken
little
to
no
head
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
for
as
strong
as
it
is
i
like
the
sweet
bread
flavor
but
too
candy
sweet
for
my
taste
it
has
a
slight
alcohol
aroma
but
not
offensive
a
beautiful
sipper
of
a
brown
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
too
prevalent
very
enjoyable
would
revisit
certainly
a
very
good
to
excellent
barrel
aged
brown
ale
fantastic
oaky
nose
and
taste
i
was
halfway
through
my
glass
before
realizing
i
was
getting
tipsy11
very
smooth
and
drinkable
so
be
slow
with
it
4
5
out
of
5
much
better
than
other
beers
with
more
hype
and
brewery
induced
exclusivity
just
because
a
brewer
limits
production
doesnt
necessarily
make
it
better
beer
o
a
really
pleasing
version
of
old
brown
dog
dangerously
easy
to
drink
given
the
very
high
abv
probably
worth
cellaring
some
for
six
months
to
a
year
overall
pretty
nice
brew
definitely
grabbing
some
bottles
to
store
in
the
cellar
i
am
not
a
big
porter
or
stout
fan
so
this
brown
ale
would
be
my
beer
of
choice
if
i
was
having
a
thick
steak
and
baked
potato
dinner
full
bodied
brown
ale
with
a
very
high
abv
11

a
perfect
sipping
mans
beer
well
done
smuttynose
overall
i
like
nice
glass
for
slow
sipping
on
a
cold
evening
the
beer
with
that
sharp
flavor
is
quite
offensive
and
the
sweetness
is
not
sufficient
to
balance
out
the
beer
dark
garnet
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
fig
toffee
and
oak
on
the
nose
with
some
breadiness
in
there
too
bran
even
slightly
creamy
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
the
same
flavors
as
the
aroma
and
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
for
balance
this
was
strong
but
it
never
felt
heavy
and
there
was
a
good
caramel
malt
tone
to
this
that
reminded
me
of
the
brown
dog
ale
that
i
was
more
familiar
with
the
nuttiness
and
underlying
sweetness
of
the
brown
sugar
and
caramel
made
this
a
slow
sipper
but
combined
with
the
fruit
flavors
made
this
one
of
the
most
complex
old
ales
that
ive
ever
had
worth
a
go
if
you
can
find
it
as
this
is
a
worthy
imperial
take
on
the
brown
dog
ale
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
key
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
an
old
ale
and
in
the
end
i
did
think
it
was
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
but
the
flavors
and
aromas
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
this
beer
has
ok
drinkability
its
fairly
smooth
a
little
crisp
a
little
creamy
nor
sticky
not
too
filling
and
the
alcohol
could
have
been
hidden
better
so
i
think
one
bottle
would
be
my
limit
i
might
regret
it
if
i
drink
more
than
one
in
a
row
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
appearance
they
are
both
really
nice
and
some
of
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
booze
i
think
it
could
have
been
a
hidden
a
little
better
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
love
to
age
some
in
the
cellar
i
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
strong
old
ales
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
some
aspects
were
little
impressive
and
some
werent
but
in
the
end
it
made
for
a
tasty
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
so
far
its
one
of
my
favorite
smuttynose
beers
and
its
one
of
the
better
old
ales
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
is
a
tasty
old
ale
keep
it
up
o
a
big
warming
old
ale
that
you
know
means
business
upon
first
sip
its
brash
and
sweet
and
maybe
lacking
complexities
but
the
deep
caramelbrown
sugar
flavors
are
pretty
substantial
definitely
hits
the
spot
as
a
sipper
on
yet
another
cold
and
snowy
night
will
probably
buy
this
to
age
and
save
for
future
winters
while
the
aroma
is
a
bit
off
the
fact
that
is
smells
a
bit
of
wet
dog
kind
of
adds
to
the
allure
of
this
beer
based
on
its
name
the
color
is
lovely
and
the
taste
is
malty
and
mellow
im
curious
to
see
what
age
does
to
it
overall
kind
of
buttery
which
makes
me
question
aging
it
though
a
small
amount
of
time
may
do
it
some
justice
golden
amber
in
color
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
retention
or
lacing
smells
of
some
bread
and
fruits
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
and
biscuits
coats
the
palate
nicely
and
is
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
indulging
on
this
smuttynose
take
on
an
old
ale
not
super
impressed
with
this
one
smuttynose
can
do
better
really
old
brown
dog
is
a
good
old
stock
ale
that
is
a
sipper
even
after
approximately
2years
of
age
the
ale
paired
well
with
mexican
style
salsa
and
chips
a
great
beer
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
little
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
fresh
bread
taste
is
that
of
deep
malt
and
dried
fruit
its
sweet
on
a
molasses
like
level
on
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
present
at
the
end
with
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
medium
body
and
just
enough
carbonation
add
to
an
overall
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
experience
definitely
worth
trying
a
deep
rich
brown
with
a
shortlasting
creamy
white
head
the
head
leaves
bigger
volumes
of
small
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
nutty
but
also
sweet
think
hazelnut
the
body
tastes
barrelaged
and
it
dominates
the
flavor
profile
the
body
is
nice
weight
and
there
is
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
this
is
drinking
nicely
right
now
but
with
at
least
a
year
of
aging
it
would
be
even
better

the

be

recommend
picking
up
a

a

old

it
really
did

it

my
whole

a
dark
somewhat
murky
mahogany
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
good
bit
of
lace
and
a
fine
layer
of
tiny
bubbles
on
top
caramel
and
alcoholic
sweetness
in
the
nose
along
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
maybe
some
slight
esters
this
is
a
fairly
sweet
beer
the
high
alcohol
is
also
pretty
noticeable
but
there
is
more
to
the
taste
than
just
that
as
caramel
is
also
very
strongly
present
there
isnt
much
there
in
terms
of
hoppiness
but
there
is
a
bittering
character
to
somewhat
balance
the
sweetness
pretty
slick
mouthfeel
as
the
sweetness
really
lingers
for
a
long
time
carbonation
is
pretty
low
which
helps
the
beer
feel
pretty
heavy
and
the
alcohol
brings
a
warming
character
to
the
beer
overall
while
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
hoping
to
like
it
more
than
i
do
it
is
a
nice
sipper
although
too
sweet
for
me
and
id
wish
for
the
malt
to
be
more
complex
as
that
seems
to
be
somewhat
lacking
at
first
sip
i
thought
this
would
be
a
nice
brown
ale
but
it
has
some
strange
taste
that
i
cannot
describeit
is
a
bitter
taste
that
hangs
with
you
after
each
mouthful
kinda
like
biting
into
a
rotten
nut
yuck
i
had
high
hopes
upon
first
sip
but
actually
dumped
the
rest
of
my
pint
and
the
remaining
bottle
contents
down
the
drain
i
have
only
dumped
a
few
beers
down
the
drain
in
my
life
and
this
is
one
of
them
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wish
that
off
flavor
wasnt
there
as
it
would
make
this
a
really
great
beer
poured
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
one
finger
head
that
stuck
around
and
a
strong
malt
smell
hit
me
immediately
as
i
got
chocolate
toffee
caramel
a
touch
of
roasted
or
coffee
malts
and
something
akin
to
molasses
or
syrup
and
there
is
that
dark
fruit
aroma
figs
black
cherries
not
sure
thick
fullbodied
slightly
chewey
and
heavy
this
is
not
a
beer
if
you
like
em
light
or
not
sweet
the
sweet
malts
overpowered
everything
but
since
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
the
balance
was
just
right
for
me
caramel
toffee
chocolate
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
sticky
syrupiness
or
molasses
as
well
but
there
is
a
touch
fruit
sweetness
i
swear
i
picked
up
cherry
the
alcohol
is
low
key
but
does
contribute
to
a
dryer
finish
very
slow
sipper
for
me
and
one
that
i
really
enjoyed
o
the
best
component
of
this
brew
is
how
well
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
other
than
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
simply
off
balance
and
a
lack
identity
here
oa
solid
well
made
old
ale
adam
an
its
variants
are
better
but
for
the
price
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
i
didnt
taste
this
one
when
it
was
fresh
but
i
still
feel
like
the
flavors
have
probably
blended
well
over
the
past
year
i
think
this
beer
has
probably
improved
other
than
being
oxidized
and
a
little
stale
it
wasnt
always
kept
at
cellar
temps
o
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
flavors
and
aromas
of
this
beer
but
i
just
wish
that
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
well
hidden
in
it
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
it
feels
like
it
is
somewhere
between
a
brown
ale
maybe
an
imperial
brown
ale
and
a
barleywine
o
strange
and
nasty
right
out
of
the
gate
give
it
few
swirls
and
some
time
to
air
out
and
warm
and
its
not
all
that
bad
i
think
that
its
not
too
often
one
me
comes
across
a
doublestrength
brown
and
can
be
unprepared
however
the
alcohol
could
be
thought
of
as
harsh
and
a
good
year
or
two
hiding
this
away
could
fix
that
really
old
brown
dog
ale
is
a
really
tasty
old
ale
loaded
with
dark
fruit
deep
and
toasty
malt
flavors
and
a
solid
booze
kick
its
rather
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
and
provide
quite
a
bargain
overall
really
old
brown
dog
is
one
of
the
best
values
on
the
market
five
bucks
for
a
tasty
bomber
is
really
hard
to
beat
theres
real
depth
of
flavor
here
it
almost
tastes
like
a
bba
beer
with
the
rich
malt
and
boozy
tones
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
drinkability
the
nose
started
things
off
on
a
fair
note
as
well
giving
bright
butterscotch
sweetness
and
veritable
smorgasbord
of
fruit
to
behold
while
the
former
translated
well
into
the
flavoring
coming
across
as
big
relatively
dark
and
biscuity
the
latter
added
pecks
of
sweetness
here
and
there
only
becoming
starkly
noticeable
in
the
end
of
the
sip
where
it
was
left
essentially
on
its
own
to
fight
through
the
harshly
bitter
boozy
and
musky
finish
this
was
at
first
sip
rather
offputting
but
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavors
melded
a
bit
more
calming
the
booze
while
that
10
10
itself
started
to
warm
the
drinker
and
calm
that
pucker
reflex
as
you
sat
back
and
accepted
what
was
in
front
of
you
this
is
an
interesting
offering
from
smuttynose
but
it
just
wasnt
exactly
to
the
same
level
weve
come
to
expect
from
them
and
especially
from
their
big
beer
lineup
o
pretty
nice
old
ale
i
dont
love
the
wood
flavor
but
besides
that
im
ok
with
this
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
rubyhighlighted
light
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
filmy
head
coating
the
surface
aromas
of
roasted
nut
sweetness
old
world
fruit
sweetness
and
boozy
character
this
one
smells
big
flavors
are
rich
and
bold
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
roast
and
bitter
backbone
supporting
date
and
fig
sweetness
throughout
subtle
spices
and
honey
sweet
highlight
as
well
as
a
not
so
subtle
boozy
ribbon
throughout
the
palate
rich
slightly
cloying
sweet
aftertaste
with
earthy
notes
slick
slightly
abrupt
finish
on
the
palate
with
a
slightly
sweet
and
boozy
linger
murky
mahogany
hue
with
nearly
no
head
just
a
wispy
topping
aromas
of
raisin
apple
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
oxidation
from
the
age
and
a
vague
nuttiness
rich
malty
taste
but
not
overly
sweet
by
any
means
brown
bread
cake
apple
brown
sugar
light
earthy
spice
and
fig
very
smooth
well
integrated
flavors
moderate
body
lighter
than
initially
expected
but
the
07
was
a
laidback
7
compared
to
todays
10
nothing
outstanding
but
i
enjoyed
my
ten
ounces
really
dark
amber
that
looks
brown
unless
held
to
the
light
nice
white
lacing
doesnt
last
long
as
it
warms
smell
is
not
that
intense
until
it
warms
up
then
the
floral
violet
candies
booziness
comes
out
somewhat
floral
and
sweet
caramel
with
a
hint
of
hazelnut
creme
liqueur
and
maybe
some
chocolate
on
the
nose
sweet
without
being
overly
cloying
because
of
the
burn
from
the
alcohol
the
flavor
is
just
kinda
sugary
and
maybe
marzipan
then
the
violetlike
fusel
alcohol
flavor
comes
in
and
the
burn
starts
to
sear
all
the
sweet
mess
off
my
tongue
wont
revisit
unless
someone
opens
a
bottle
from
their
stash
good
nice
offering
o
the
spicy
and
wood
is
well
balanced
with
nice
malt
characters
that
compliment
each
other
i
dont
get
any
dried
fruit
character
but
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
i
think
it
would
age
well
i
couldnt
believe
this
was
just
sitting
on
the
shelf
when
i
walked
in
yesterday
this
is
really
deep
and
complex
lots
of
caramelhoneyvanillaoakmarshmallow
sweetness
but
a
really
nice
bit
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
i
need
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
before
they
dissapear
bottle
dated
033112
and
probably
could
have
done
with
another
year
or
two
of
cellaring
pours
an
oily
rubyamber
a
beautiful
colour
but
with
little
head
or
lacing
resinous
aroma
of
wooden
planks
and
bourbon
barrels
with
a
sweet
caramelized
malt
background
an
alcohol
bitterness
in
the
nose
and
very
much
so
in
the
warmth
of
the
finish
flavours
arent
as
well
balanced
as
id
choose
with
an
initial
sweetness
that
transitions
to
pure
alcohol
and
bitterness
doesnt
have
the
depth
i
expected
from
this
caliber
of
a
brewery
but
that
may
be
my
fault
for
drinking
it
too
young
should
have
bought
two
so
i
could
have
confirmed
overall
a
decent
vintage
very
complex
a
bit
too
cloying
on
the
whole
for
my
taste
however
this
particular
sample
has
aged
quite
gracefully
kudos
to
smuttynose
in
crafting
a
fine
brew
m
medium
body
chewy
light
to
moderate
carbonation
note
2012
vintage
well
i
didnt
cellar
this
beer
i
bought
it
today
it
pours
a
deep
rich
murky
red
with
a
khaki
head
that
dissapates
quickly
it
leaves
a
nice
lacing
while
it
lasts
it
smells
of
figs
malt
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
citrus
it
has
a
creamyoily
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
figs
vanilla
and
a
slight
oakiness
dominate
the
palate
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
lingers
along
with
a
slight
tingling
on
the
tongue
as
other
reviewers
have
said
it
is
a
little
rum
like
i
will
have
to
buy
a
few
more
and
try
aging
them
although
it
is
excellent
right
now
this
bottle
was
a
2008
vintage
from
my
cellar
poured
into
tulip
glasses
chestnut
brown
body
carbonation
has
diminished
a
bit
but
there
was
still
decent
lacing
smell
was
ripe
with
raisins
and
fig
flavor
was
sugary
rumlike
and
malty
still
a
hit
of
booze
there
after
all
these
years
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
but
still
smooth
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
think
it
aged
well
it
just
so
happened
that
i
had
a
2008
smutty
baltic
porter
the
same
weekend
and
that
blew
the
robda
out
of
the
water
overall
i
think
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
these
two
editions
is
a
decent
beer
but
for
me
the
newer
was
too
green
and
the
aged
one
was
too
sweet
and
cloying
i
ended
up
blending
the
two
to
confirm
my
belief
but
the
beer
still
lacks
some
complexity
which
i
desire
in
my
big
beers
of
this
nature
a
good
beer
though
higher
in
alcohol
for
my
taste
drinks
small
all
in
all
its
pretty
good
but
perhaps
nothing
super
special
goes
down
well
for
its
high
alcohol
anyhow
i
love
smutty
ill
buy
another
and
check
it
out
next
fall
o
this
is
the
fresh
2013
batch
having
tried
this
before
with
some
age
on
it
i
must
say
that
i
think
it
will
be
much
better
in
october
or
november
definitely
planning
to
pick
up
another
for
the
cellar
also
this
is
my
first
review
and
it
makes
me
realize
that
while
i
have
formed
definite
opinions
about
what
i
like
and
dont
like
i
have
trouble
finding
adjectives
for
this
beer
is
heavybodied
true
to
style
with
medium
to
mediumlight
carbonation
this
brew
sits
on
the
palate
a
fairly
long
time
to
let
the
flavors
and
ethanol
sink
in
resulting
mouthfeel
is
thick
chewy
spicy
and
burning
ethanol
creates
the
burning
essentialy
from
the
front
of
the
palate
onwards
spicy
arises
also
from
ethanol
with
substantial
heat
and
burn
from
this
component
closes
dryly
with
some
lingering
stickiness
on
lips
from
sugars
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
i
liked
this
very
much
and
will
look
for
it
in
bottles
recommend
it
very
good
as
is
but
would
probably
benefit
from
some
aging
it
seems
a
bit
green
ive
been
looking
at
this
in
my
cellar
for
the
last
6
months
picked
a
good
outdoor
night
with
the
beer
tasting
group
to
pull
it
out
very
unique
thanks
for
the
cellar
cleaning
mikeyv35
o
i
like
this
as
a
warming
old
ale
good
amplified
flavor
really
shows
up
in
the
taste
profile
keep
the
big
beer
series
coming
smutty
very
nice
old
ale
rich
and
complex
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
big
10
beer
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
some
time
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
o
a
good
beer
but
that
is
all
i
love
old
ales
wee
heavies
and
barleywines
but
this
not
one
of
the
best
but
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
rather
like
an
american
barleywine
met
a
brown
ale
in
style
o
overall
a
solid
malty
brew
that
i
think
will
age
exceptionally
well
o
as
a
2007
vintage
i
was
a
bit
nervous
but
when
i
purchased
this
bottle
at
smuttynose
back
in
december
of
2011
i
knew
it
had
been
cared
for
properly
it
has
aged
extremely
well
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
smuttys
big
beer
series
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
another
vintage
brew
from
them
creamy
malt
with
a
slight
taste
of
toffee
followed
by
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
it
is
smooth
and
not
as
harsh
as
curmudgeon
but
then
it
also
lacks
the
flavor
overall
it
falls
a
little
flat
o
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
an
enjoyable
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
fairly
well
and
introduces
some
nice
flavors
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
tasting
beer
big
malt
body
caramel
light
hop
bitterness
and
a
good
rich
body
i
agree
aging
it
would
probably
make
things
even
better
o
could
use
some
age
but
this
certainly
isnt
as
bad
fresh
as
some
people
have
made
this
out
to
be
maybe
its
just
this
years
but
this
is
solid
fresh
definitely
get
a
couple
bottles
to
age
though
this
is
a
beer
that
has
already
caught
me
by
surprise
this
ancient
canine
ale
coats
my
cup
well
for
a
10
percent
beer
the
lacing
on
my
glass
is
brilliant
the
head
retention
is
quite
impressive
as
well
i
take
a
quick
smell
wow
is
that
fruity
seriously
it
has
the
scent
of
a
ripe
yet
tart
apple
it
packs
an
acetic
punch
i
also
pick
up
on
some
brown
sugar
and
date
characteristics
too
honestly
its
a
very
comely
smell
i
take
a
taste
and
quickly
i
am
caught
of
guard
yet
again
by
its
wellrounded
sweetness
again
it
has
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
but
it
is
not
cloying
at
all
it
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
some
interestingly
leathery
notes
almost
like
tobacco
this
is
quite
a
complex
beer
its
chewy
its
estery
and
its
a
success
for
smuttynose
try
this
beer
cheers
needs
age
big
time
really
sweet
and
still
pretty
good
but
with
age
could
be
amazing
ill
grab
another
bottle
and
let
it
sit
for
2
years
this
one
is
kind
of
a
mess
sweet
yet
with
noticeable
alcohol
the
yeast
is
present
and
kind
of
pleasant
odi
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
beaut
for
a
few
years
this
is
a
big
bold
complex
and
outright
delicious
old
ale
kept
me
interested
throughout
and
also
added
a
pretty
legit
buzz
from
the
whole
bomber
smuttynose
is
terrifically
consistent
and
at
6
for
this
brew
its
a
decent
deal
o
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
excellent
it
is
only
my
second
old
ale
the
first
being
hair
of
the
dogs
adam
and
i
would
say
that
it
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
adam
o
though
the
abv
is
high
this
beer
still
has
what
it
takes
to
show
the
varieties
of
complex
notes
to
each
review
category
im
thoroughly
impressed
i
think
this
ranks
up
among
the
stars
of
the
greatest
beers
ive
ever
had
at
least
for
me
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
d
drinks
really
good
for
how
fresh
this
is
would
love
to
put
some
of
these
down
for
a
little
bit
and
for
the
price
this
is
certainly
reasonable
pours
a
clear
dark
coppery
brown
almost
mahogany
with
a
very
thick
if
not
too
persistent
pale
tan
head
strong
aroma
has
a
malty
core
and
a
yeasty
overtone
plus
hints
of
apple
caramel
and
cloves
scrumptious
flavor
has
firm
malty
and
yeasty
notes
plus
tones
of
cloves
caramel
and
apple
it
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohollike
bite
texture
has
average
body
but
is
quite
lively
and
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
persistent
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
lips
this
dog
will
have
your
taste
buds
barking
with
joy
o
this
offering
from
smuttingnose
is
a
winner
in
my
book
poured
from
bomber
into
duvel
tulip
this
beer
looks
amazing
fluffy
off
white
head
with
a
nice
brownred
body
head
rests
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
tight
bubbles
form
the
carbonation
smells
a
bit
boozy
with
hints
of
fruit
maybe
apple
tastes
malty
sweet
with
a
bit
of
boozy
hotness
overall
a
good
beer
at
a
fair
price
under
9
md
an
overall
drinkable
old
ale
with
great
complexity
and
a
mellow
rounded
out
flavor

a
sneaky

to
put

away
from
the
experience
notes
of
chocolate
toasted
grain
raisin
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
white
pepper
are
all
present
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
while
being
creamy
and
smooth
and
finishes
on
the
dry
side
overall
good
flavors
and
complexity
but
the
booze
is
overwhelming
as
far
as
an
old
ale
goes
this
is
in
a
category
of
its
own
but
i
do
feel
the
product
is
what
was
intended
by
the
brewery
a
fusion
between
a
brown
ale
and
an
old
ale
makes
sense
but
i
wasnt
crazy
over
this
one
this
one
is
nice
and
rich
but
the
dryness
on
the
finish
that
strikes
the
perfect
balance
between
the
two
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
for
sure
do
a
nice
change
of
pace
this
strong
ale
is
malt
focused
with
clearly
english
qualities
it
delivers
a
complex
but
inclusive
experience
seeming
careful
not
to
tread
too
heavily
on
the
palate
while
not
perfect
it
is
different
enough
and
charming
enough
to
be
remembered
as
something
of
a
sleeper
o
i
love
the
smell
of
this
but
i
just
cant
get
down
with
the
taste
other
than
that
its
halfway
decent
for
how
strong
it
is
a
nice
bit
englishy
style
old
ale
i
like
it
a
very
flavorful
and
intersting
brew
many
subtle
layers
to
enjoy
the
intense
musty
leathery
oaky
tobacco
quality
is
something
i
have
not
encountered
before
soft
amber
caramel
color
with
a
nice
head
this
beers
nose
is
quite
interesting
and
actually
reminds
me
of
an
old
dog
that
just
so
happens
to
be
really
old
yet
intriguing
as
the
brew
touches
my
palate
it
takes
on
a
whole
other
dimension
drinks
well
for
having
an
abv
of
10
impressive
big
beer
series
selection
from
smuttynose
overall
this
is
excellent
beer
and
the
aging
that
has
been
done
to
the
normal
old
brown
dog
ale
has
brought
out
an
excellent
range
of
flavors
in
fact
only
the
slightlytoohigh
alcoholic
kick
prevents
this
one
from
being
a
perfect
5
in
flavor
must
try
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
creamy
overall
the
last
15
months
have
treated
this
beer
very
well
and
ill
certainly
make
sure
i
lay
a
bottle
of
this
down
each
time
its
released
beer
is
very
vanillay
and
oaky
on
the
finish
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
heat
and
solvent
it
sort
of
tastes
like
vanilla
extract
at
times
it
also
burns
a
bit
it
is
very
strong
very
forward
not
a
horrible
beer
but
there
is
definitely
some
odd
alcohols
in
this
one
not
a
repeat
o
nice
brew
it
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
really
big
brown
ale
and
an
old
ale
or
a
barleywine
toasted
malt
character
is
quite
strong
and
pleasant
big
and
boozy
especially
this
young
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
in
smuttynoses
big
beer
series
i
miss
the
baltic
porter
that
was
a
damn
fine
product
poured
into
a
20
oz
duvel
tulip
glass
poured
aggressive
and
got
a
huge
4
inch
sticky
white
head
with
tons
lacing
and
excellent
retention
smell
is
brown
sugar
bread
alcohol
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
all
of
that
less
booze
than
the
smell
huge
brown
sugar
up
front
with
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
in
the
finish
body
is
thinner
than
you
expect
but
medium
plenty
of
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
a
definite
sipper
this
beer
has
gotten
better
over
the
years
much
more
approachable
than
few
years
ago
and
less
boozy
superbly
drinkable
as
a
sipper
while
reading
or
to
be
paired
with
a
fine
meal
i
had
no
problem
reaching
for
a
second
round
o
a
pleasant
surprise
huge
flavor
profile
with
plenty
of
complexity
gets
a
bit
sweet
as
it
warms

imo
22
ounce

2010
vintage
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishmahogany
color
with
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
the
brew
smells
like
brown
sugar
toffee
brandy
caramel
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
toffee
caramel
dark
fruit
vanilla
and
some
booze
mouthfeelbody
is
full
its
rich
and
chewy
with
moderate
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
good
overall
beer
ill
have
to
buy
another
bottle
of
this
and
age
it
for
longer
definitely
worth
trying
nice
big
beer
the
flavours
are
all
pleasant
but
i
feel
the
balance
has
slipped
somewhere
and
in
a
different
sweetnessnonsweetness
ratio
this
could
be
amazing
great
beer
it
doesnt
shy
away
from
showing
its
alcohol
but
it
manages
to
balance
it
really
nicely
its
a
big
sweet
and
heavy
beer
no
question
but
its
also
a
delectably
drinkable
one
overall
very
good
take
on
the
style
everything
i
would
expect
and
no
surprises
which
is
good
and
disappointing
id
love
to
try
an
aged
version
of
this
beer
but
i
will
probably
reach
for
this
again
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
and
i
think
takes
the
spot
as
my
favorite
from
the
folks
at
smuttynose
overall
very
drinkable
hardly
a
hint
of
booze
in
this
08
brew
this
is
like
having
a
fine
portsherry
wine
for
dessert
the
older
the
dog
the
better
the
dog
and
at
this
price
see
above
i
will
go
back
for
more
2008
bottle

of
g311
the
brew
pours
a
lustrous
auburnmahogany
hue
and
is
capped
with
an
inch
or
two
of
khaki
froth
the
beer
is
very
deliciously
malty
with
notes
favoring
rich
caramel
akin
to
sugar
babies
candy
and
with
a
hint
of
herbal
spicy
earthy
hops
still
apparent
it
is
silky
and
rich
but
not
overwhelming
the
abv
is
unnoticeable
really
nice
and
drinkable
beer
here
i
easily
crushed
the
bomber
solo
overall
solid
beer
and
does
the
original
proud
this
doesnt
taste
anything
like
an
old
ale
barleywine
imo
it
tastes
like
an
imperial
brown
and
a
damned
good
one
at
that
perfect
autumn
beer
and
the
nearly
4
years
in
the
bottle
have
mellowed
it
out
nicely
d
a
slow
sipper
best
enjoyed
with
others
well
done
as
are
most
of
the
big
beer
series
beers
poured
ruby
tinted
brown
color
with
a
light
but
steady
head
of
carbonated
bubbles
smell
of
heavy
roasted
caramel
malt
rich
oak
sweet
dark
chocolate
sweet
berries
and
hint
alcohol
the
taste
is
the
exact
same
as
the
smell
the
longer
it
sets
the
more
malty
it
gets
there
is
no
mention
of
barrel
aging
but
the
oak
and
the
alcohol
flavor
are
telling
me
otherwise
maybe
its
just
the
alcohol
coming
through
this
is
a
2010
maybe
i
will
get
another
and
let
it
sit
a
little
longer
i
do
like
this
a
lot
though
dark
brown
pour
with
a
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
and
tropical
fruits
tastes
of
beautiful
ripe
berries
and
a
nice
malty
backbone
carbonation
and
mouthfee
are
amazing
not
crazy
carbonated
but
not
flat
overall
3
years
has
turned
this
maybe
b
beer
into
a
hands
down
a
absolutly
amazing
overall
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
which
is
good
in
my
opinion
no
unfermented
yeast
detected
here
very
drinkable
starts
out
super
sweet
turns
wortyroasty
then
leaves
a
nice
alcoholestery
aftertaste
overall
it
was
good
but
im
still
not
a
bit
old
ale
fan
they
are
usually
too
sweet
for
me
yum
about
8
ounces
to
go

a

notched
at
2010
pours
a
murky

dark
chestnut
color
with
a
12
inch
of
creamy
head
aroma
is
a
big
whiff
of
booze
dark
fruits
as
well
but
the
alcohol
smell
dominates
taste
is
more
of
the
same
booze
and
dark
fruits
upfront
with
some
vanilla
at
the
end
some
caramel
flavor
the
10
abv
makes
its
presence
known
very
little
carbonation
but
that
is
to
be
expected
i
would
like
to
see
if
the
alcohol
flavor
would
mellow
with
some
more
age
on
it
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
grabbing
every
so
often
fuller
bodied
decent
carbonation
chewy
and
roasty
lingering
and
lasting
feel
drinks
decently
but
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
especially
with
the
combination
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
a
nice
product
ill
look
for
another
to
cellar
mthick
and
syrupy
light
carbonation
d
you
dont
feel
its
10
till
the
end
could
but
a
few
back
quickly
pours
a
hazy
deep
brown
color
with
a
light

in
the
aroma
dry
caramel
and
a
small
roasty

the
taste

a
sipper
for
sure
my
whole
life
ive
lived
with
dogs
in
the
house
they
are
wonderful
meaningful
members
of
the
family
but
they
are
a
lot
of
work
once
they
get
old
of
course
we
still
love
them
unconditionally
the
people
at
smuttynose
obviously
love
this
beer
brewed
in
commemoration
of
their
dog
olive
but
i
cant
shake
the
thought
that
it
may
be
time
for
them
to
start
looking
at
some
new
projects
its
about
time
this
old
girl
be
retired
really
nice
brown
ale
the
aromas
are
complex
with
many
sweet
notes
the
dominant
tastes
are
nut
and
malt
it
was
an
easy
beer
to
drink
you
would
not
suspect
the
alcohol
content
was
around
10
so
it
is
slightly
dangerous
in
that
regard
highly
recommended
poured

its
pretty
gooda
one
and
done
though
with
the
alcohol
level
and
sweetness
why
have
i
passed
up
really
old
brown
dog
ale
for
so
long
its
a
highquality
beer
one
thats
a
fully
enjoyable
sipper
its
an
exceptional
value
to
boot
d
at
10
abv
you
really
dont
get
that
and
its
quite
drinkable
db
flavorful
old
ale
with
a
brown
twist
goes
down
easy
for
an
old
ale
awesome
fucking
beer
either
way
pours
a
semi
clear
dark
brown
slight
amber
colour
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
tastes
of
slight
caramal
malt
with
a
candied
sugar
like
finish
drinks
down
very
smooth
and
the
high
alc
is
very
well
hidden
very
easy
to
drink
quite
a
tasty
old
ale
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
it
was
a
bold
beer
but
came
together
pretty
nicely
it
was
hoppier
then
i
expected
for
an
old
ale
but
it
gave
it
an
american
kind
of
twist
that
i
enjoyed
pretty
decent
beer
overall
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
drinkable
the
10
can
pack
a
punch
though
enjoy
doesnt
have
that
full
on
malt
bath
feel
or
taste
that
i
expect
from
the
style
im
using
head
over
heels
in
love
with
everything
from
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
or
anything
smutty
in
general
but
this
is
pretty
average

d
this
was
probably
the
most
drinkable
old
ale
ive
ever
tried
the
old
brown
dog
doesnt
have
anything
on
this
d
for
10
abv
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
its
nice
and
silky
and
it
goes
down
smooth
this
is
another
great
addition
to
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
drinkability
a
little
bit
less
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
nicely
made
beer
nonetheless
the
10
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
but
was
undetectable
and
though
i
can
certainly
imagine
other
beers
id
likely
prefer
to
have
if
i
want
to
get
drunk
on
a
10
abv
beer
this
one
fit
the
bill
fairly
nicely
drinkability
halfway
through
the
first
pour
and
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
are
making
this
a
slow
sipper
as
i
move
on
to
the
second
glass
i
am
more
comfortable
with
this
beers
freshness
and
complex
layers
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
would
have
benefited
greatly
from
some
aging
but
im
happy
to
try
a
fresh
2010
bottle
of
this
notes
definitely
not
the
best
of
the
style
i
wonder
if
some
extended
aging
might
iron
this
one
out
a
bit
the
extreme
fruitiness
makes
it
seem
much
too
young
having
said
all
of
that
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
due
to
the
extremely
fair
price
and
wide
availability
this
will
continue
to
find
its
way
into
my
cellar
during
the
winter
months
d
goes
down
somewhat
easily
somewhat
filling
nice
kick
ok
representation
of
style
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
much
thanks
andy
for
cracking
this
one
poured
into
a
tulip
the
body
is
deep
mahogany
with
just
a
thin
layer
of
light
tan
head
than
quickly
dissipates
and
doesnt
leave
much
for
lace
the
aroma
is
very
rich
and
malty
with
lingering
aromas
of
dried
dark
fruit
toffee
and
residual
nuttiness
and
wood
the
taste
is
vey
sweet
to
start
with
caramel
malts
with
toffee
and
just
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
little
bit
of
a
woody
nutty
flavor
low
carbonation
and
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
after
taste
but
over
all
this
one
is
pretty
nice
really
just
a
sipper
but
very
enjoyable
md
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
alcohol
provides
quite
a
bit
of
warming
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
much
for
a
10
beer
if
that
is
possible
md
heavy
mouth
that
is
weighed
down
with
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
and
low
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
for
an
old
ale
final
verdict
not
bad
the
brown
sugars
are
very
pronounced
and
it
is
a
bit
too
boozy
for
my
tastes
the
beer
is
heavily
malted
with
some
run
and
plum
flavors
maybe
a
touch
of
booze
soaked
pineapple
type
fruits
the
beer
doesnt
have
a
throaty
burn
for
its
high
abv
and
its
booziness
and
thats
a
good
thing
but
the
dark
malt
brown
sugars
boozy
fruits
slight
mint
flavors
and
overall
thickness
really
define
this
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
sipper
and
mischaracterized
style
a
great
after
dinner
drink
for
sure
nice
substitute
for
a
cognac
d
very
enjoyable
and
unique
ale
would
definitely
recommend
it
watch
the
pour
or
you
will
get
close
to
four
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
mostly
loose
smaller
bubbles
but
has
a
couple
of
lilypads
of
larger
bubbles
adequate
retention
given
where
it
starts
from
the
lacing
sticks
around
well
and
lasts
much
longer
than
youd
expect
at
first
foggy
brownred
colored
liquid
cloudily
opaque
with
no
bubbles
to
be
seen

rims

thick
and
dense
nose
of

covered

there
is
absolutely
nothing
about

fruit
cant
really
expect
more

reduction
than
here
defies
anything
to
get
in
the
way
of
its
avalanche
of
sugar
fullbodied
at
first
the
tiny
bubbled
foaminess
of
the
attack
thinks
you
might
get
something
different
here
but
all
that

over

apple
pineapple
flavors
the
carbonation
is
not
weak
per
se
but
nowhere
near
being
able
to
handle
the
weight
and
momentum
of
the
primary
material
basically
if
hops
were
involved
in
the
creation
of
this
brew
damned
if
i
noticed
egregiously
smooth
and
satiny
mouth
feel
creamy
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
will
do
this
beer
a
disservice
if
you
dont
spark
a
cigar
with
a
wet
maduro
leaf
around
it
as
accompaniment
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
and
very
unique
i
can
see
picking
one
of
these
guys
up
each
year
maybe
even
putting
them
down
for
a
cellar
session
however
i
dont
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
if
anything
some
of
the
flavors
need
to
meld
or
mellow
with
age
the
sugary
sweetness
gets
to
overwhelming
proportions
later
in
the
bottle
the
boozy
heat
could
stand
a
few
months
of
cooling
off
to
allow
the
other
flavors
to
stand
out
on
their
own
brown
dog
pours
out
very
brown
not
quite
approaching
black
but
a
very
brown
dog
here
good
doggie
a
nice
vanilla
cream
colored
head
on
top
with
some
life
and
sturdiness
not
much
stick
though
this
is
big
beer
so
yes
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
but
it
does
not
burn
a
whole
lot
of
brown
sugar
reaches
my
nostrils
though
this
one
smells
sweet
but
not
killer
like
a
certain
upstate
ny
brewery
taste
is
a
mix
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
roast
chocolate
plum
more
dark
fruits
and
some
booze
i
like
the
mix
it
tastes
really
good
for
what
seems
to
be
a
mix
of
a
big
brown
and
a
old
ale
feel
is
above
medium
and
a
bit
hot
but
this
goes
down
smooth
as
silk
a
nice
amount
of
life
on
the
tounge
the
alcohol
hit
me
i
dont
think
i
could
do
a
whole
bottle
of
this
one
to
the
head
a
bit
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
a
great
one
to
share
with
some
peeps
d
a
very
tasty
brew
and
a
really
great
sipper
on
a
cold
night
not
to
hot
you
cant
enjoy
it
fresh
but
will
be
even
better
with
some
time
on
it
this
with
some
warm
apple
pie
and
vanilla
ice
cream
would
be
amazing
pours
a
murky
chocolate
brown
color
with
some
honey
hightlights
which
gives
the
beer
an
iced
tea
appearance
the
head
was
small
yet
tight
left
a
ring
once
it
settled
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
candied
plums
raisins
and
fig
perhaps
a
touch
of
roast
a
nice
balanced
aroma
for
an
olde
ale
a
very
nice
milk
chocolate
malt
which
serves
as
the
backbone
for
the
flavor
profile
some
vanilla
is
present
before
the
dark
fruit
flavors
start
to
seep
in
there
is
some
boozy
raisinsplum
to
go
along
with
fig
and
carob
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bitter
presence
in
the
end
the
beer
has
a
moderate
to
fully
body
with
prickly
carbonation
a
bit
chewy
and
a
light
abv
hit
a
fresh
old
ale
as
it
was
brewed
in
2010
it
doesnt
have
the
strong
vinous
fruit
flavors
which
is
typical
for
the
style
but
the
flavors
that
it
does
have
i
enjoy
the
feel
is
still
a
bit
raw
as
the
carbonation
is
present
but
i
dont
really
mind
that
give
it
a
year
and
it
would
be
most
enjoyable
d
not
sure
if
it
is
has
great
drinkability
but
it
is
nice
worth
a
try
not
sure
how
often
id
ever
want
to
order
this
beer
but
its
not
bad
highly
recommended
all
in
all
this
one
tasted
better
at
the
tasting
its
a
good
brew
but
not
a
great
brew
some
age
might
help
mellow
out
the
alcohol
but
the
flavors
arent
as
extensive
as
i
wouldve
liked
worth
a
try
if
you
have
access
but
dont
bother
hunting
it
drinkability
wise
its
great
having
more
than
one
may
ruin
your
palate
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
its
a
dominating
feeling
within
the
taste
buds
spicy
robust
and
damn
right
tasty
cheers
d
not
a
beer
id
drink
of
regularly
but
nonetheless
well
made
and
drinkable
md
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
there
is
almost
a
grainy
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
overall
another

bottling
i
mentioned
this
beer
is
not
complex
however
that
does
not
mean
its
boring
sometimes
a
focus
on
a
few
aspects
really
allows
a
particular
aspect
of
a
beer
to
shine
through
and
really
old
brown
dog
is
exactly
that
a
big
and
really
tasty
brown
ale
this
is
not
exactly
traditional
but
it
is
exactly
what
i
personally
want
from
an
old
ale
i
bet
the
bottle
im
going
to
age
will
become
an
a
beer
the
taste
is
much
more
complex
with
raisins
figs
malt
and
sweet
candy
and
brown
sugars
vanilla
and
brandy
give
it
another
dimension
this
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
creme
bruleelike
custard
feel
the
10
can
definitely
be
felt
but
the
strong
hints
at
the
alcohol
go
on
and
off
while
its
velvety
richness
ultimately
outlasts
the
booziness
like
to
try
this
again
with
some
time
on
it
it
has
a
decent
drinkability
drinks
much
lighter
than
10
but
a
touch
of
booze
some
lingering
malts
that
are
nice
but
it
adds
a
hint
of
salty
minerality
as
well
a
nice
chewy
flavor
too
dthis
beer
is
a
bit
harsh
and
as
others
have
said
it
would
probably
benefit
from
aging
22oz
bottle
into
a
hopus
tulip
pours
a
crisp
not
too
dark
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
khaki
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
toasted
brown
malts
brown
sugar
mild
cocoa
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
toasted
brown
malts
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
amount
of
earthy
mildly
citrus
hops
providing
a
nice
backbone
to
this
very
sweet
brew
the
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
it
certainly
seems
like
it
will
tone
down
with
age
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
plan
on
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
see
how
it
ages
like
a
nice
tawny
port
though
not
as
sweet
it
had
gracious
nutty
aromas
and
flavors
and
nice
toffee
on
the
palate
a
very
generous
beer
that
was
certainly
not
overwhelming
smutty
recently
started
filling
this
in
12oz
bottles
i
picked
one
up
for

abv
tasting
notes
above
from
the
2010
vintage
are
still
applicable
the
experience
is
much
like
i
remember
from
having
this
several
times
before
from
the
2010
series
sampled
on
aug
31
2010
the
pour
is
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
decent
fluffy
beige
head
that
settles
down
and
leaves
lacing
along
the
way
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
roasted
malts
dark
fruit
esthers
and
a
minor
dose
of
hops
the
body
is
full
the
taste
has
a
little
more
of
an
alcohol
pungency
than
in
the
aroma
but
overall
the
result
is
malts
and
bitter
hops
around
the
edges
pours
a
dark
chestnut
with
a
creamy
pancake
head
smells
sweet
almost
of
maple
syrup
tastes
big
and
sweet
and
of
maple
syrup
but
there
is
some
firm
malt
and
some
earthy
hops
helping
to
break
things
up
this
is
a
big
sweet
beer
and
as
such
is
definitely
a
sipper
id
say
late
fall
on
the
deck
reminicent
of
new
hollands
dragonsmilk
with
less
sweetness
and
more
tartness
the
malts
hold
really
old
together
i
would
swear
this
tap
serving
ame
from
a
barrel
or
firkin
aging
but
novare
res
in
portland
maine
offers
me
no
details
it
has
a
huge
body
creamy
and
chewy
it
certainly
tastes
barrel
conditioned
i
enjoyed
this
bigger
beer
and
i
dont
see
the
connections
to
the
old
brown
dog
brewed
by
smuttynose
except
for
the
naming
an
excellent
highgravity
beer
that
does
not
represent
the
purported
style
but
i
could
certainly
see
craving
this
big
beer
an
interesting
american
twist
on
an
old
ale
but
its
far
from
any
traditional
examples
of
the
style
smutty
hints
that
this
is
a
good
candidate
for
aging
we
agree
as
everything
still
seems
a
bit
too
green
for
the
style
however
if
you
cant
wait
like
us
we
recommend
allowing
this
beer
to
warm
and
open
up
before
enjoying
it
more
age
might
enhance
the
vinuous
notes
but
this
is
drinking
very
well
at
the
moment
there
are
more
complex
examples
of
the
style
but
the
flavors
in
this
are
wonderful
d
good
flavor
a
bit
hot
to
drink
alot
of
but
very
enjoyable
to
me
the
palate
is
solid
for
its
age
its
still
surprisingly
hoppy
with
a
moderate
earthy
leafy
character
the
hop
character
coupled
with
a
light
to
moderate
grainy
bitterness
forms
a
great
backbone
upon
which
the
malt
character
is
allowed
to
shine
mildly
fruity
for
sure
with
some
prunes
theres
also
a
solid
leather
character
the
flavors
and
nose
make
me
thing
of
an
amped
up
nut
brown
ale
while
theres
a
touch
of
stale
oxidation
present
thankfully
it
isnt
too
much
slightly
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
honey
and
bitterness
this
beer
is
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
too
drinking
an
entire
22oz
is
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
chore
but
ive
got
all
night
unfortunately
though
i
never
got
around
to
finishing
it
oh
well
i
still
did
enjoy
the
beer
overall
my
theory
remains
untainted
this
was
a
good
brew
it
was
just
a
little
to
hot
for
me
at
this
point
in
time
more
age
should
do
it
nicely
t
big
fruity
strawberry
peach
pear
and
watermelon
yes
watermelon

drizzled
on

what
a
unique
old

a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
label
states
bottle
conditioned
in
2007
uncapped
and
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
honey
chestnut
color
with
barely
a
fingers
worth
of
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
molasses
light
brown

mild

of
cherry
raisins
a
good
amount
of
caramelized

plums
going
off
the
abv
i
expected
this
to
have
more
body
certainly
does
not
drink
like
a
10
ale
decent
overall
but
im
not
sure
holding
on
to
this
for
a
few
years
yielded
any
benefits
overall
sip
savor
share
very
tasty
and
complex
but
also
big
strong
and
boozy
d
i
think
another
would
be
trouble
but
i
want
a
case
of
this
to
sit
on
truly
an
amazing
beer
wow
drinkability
id
like
to
get
another
and
see
how
it
ages
after
three
years
but
this
seems
like
a
good
time
to
drink
the
2008
vintage
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
great
sipper
another
great
effort
from
smuttynose
bottle
from
new
hampshire
trip
d
nice
hop
backbone
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
d
a
bit
too
hot
and
a
bit
too
thick
to
make
this
one
highly
quaffable
definitely
a
bythefire
type
of
sipper
da
lovely
brew
a
bomber
is
maybe
a
bit
much
as
it
packs
a
punch
and
has
a
strong
flavor
profile
but
definately
a
keeper
and
probably
a
good
one
to
cook
with
as
well
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
smuttynose
but
this
is
clearly
the
best
thing
i
have
ever
tried
from
them
d
not
an
old
ale
but
it
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
which
is
an
often
neglected
style
i
am
not
certain
if
imperial
brown
ale
is
a
real
animal
i
still
would
not
put
this
beer
into
that
realm
because
it
is
not
complex
or
lush
in
terms
of
flavor
also
the
body
color
and
head
retention
dont
go
beyond
the
normal
scope
of
a
brown
ale
the
only
things
about
this
beer
that
make
it
big
are
the
quantity
of
hops
and
the
abv
i
think
this
beer
is
just
what
i
stated
above
an
excellent
brown
ale
and
nothing
more
man
i
like
this
beer
a
whole
lot
it
breaks
the
mould
in
that
it
has
elements
of
a
traditional
old
peculieresque
old
ale
a
belgian
strong
dark
and
the
more
recent
interpretations
of
the
style
brewed
in
the
united
states
that
resemble
strong
english
barleywines
im
very
sad
that
i
never
got
to
try
the
original
incarnation
of
this
beer
the
high
drinkability
is
a
giant
plus
in
my
book
as
the
flavor
profile
is
still
very
bold
as
with
the
finish
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
smuttynose
robd
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
nice
thick
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
rich
dark
fruit
and
a
lot
of
dry
oak
some
herbal
hops
and
medicinal
alcohol
show
up
as
well
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
sharp
upfront
but
the
raisiny
sweetness
gives
way
to
more
sharp
herbal
and
grapefruity
hops
the
oak
is
apparent
upfront
but
comes
out
more
in
the
finish
which
is
sweet
with
more
malty
dark
fruit
and
some
hints
of
port
d
insanely
drinkable
fresh
it
was
not
nearly
this
good
which
pounds
home
the
point
never
drink
an
old
ale
fresh
even
4
months
will
do
you
wonders
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
continues
to
impress
chestnut
brown

is

thin

complex
subtle

i
get

right

also
rum
sensations
of

and
a
little
whiskey
fruity

along
the
line
of
a

punch
maltiness
is
pretty
rich
and
nougat
and
caramel
come
through
as
well
body
is
medium
to
medium
full
and
the
carbonation
is
held
in
check
creating
quite
a
silky
feel
in
the
mouth
and
lending
to
easy
drinkability
for
a
10
beverage
unique
and
well
done
d
a
little
sweet
and
boozy
but
makes
for
a
nice
sipper
especially
if
you
share
the
bottle
with
a
friend
hv
d
everything
smuttynose
is
new
to
me
and
im
loving
it
this
is
sweeter
than
what
i
would
usually
drink
but
id
have
it
again
without
anyone
twisting
my
arm
a
tad
too
sweet
for
the
style
but
still
a
great
brew
highly
recommend
for
old
ale
lovers
d
likable
stuff
another
solid
brew
from
smuttynose
ill
ask
again
please
can
you
come
to
oregon
this
particular
one
isnt
my
favorite
of
their
brews
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
or
is
it
brown
ale
or
old
ale
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
would
have
another
yet
again
i
am
thoroughly
satisfied
by
another
brew
from
smuttynose
they
are
making
a
fan
outta
me
overall
this
beer
is
somewhere
in
between
an
old
ale
and
a
brown
ale
im
not
very
familiar
with
the
english
strong
ale
so
this
may
be
what
smuttynose
was
going
for
but
i
wouldve
liked
a
bit
more
emphasis
on
the
brown
ale
side
of
things
still
its
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
decent
strong
ale
but
is
extremely
sweet
and
one
dimensional
in
that
way
its
still
very
good
but
definitely
a
sipper
and
not
a
bottle
to
finish
yourself
medium
body
appropriately
carbonated
couldnt
really
taste
any
alcohol
at
all
definitely
a
sipper
ill
probably
be
picking
up
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
does
with
some
age
on
it
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
i
had
hoped
the
aftertaste
really
puts
a
damper
on
things
smuttynose
really
old
brown
dog
is
a
very
clear
dense
brown
ale
with
a
generous
thick
dense
foamy
yellow
head
that
has
incredible
retention
it
smells
kind
of
like
a
home
brew
there
are
notes
of
green
hops
peppercorns
and
resiny
malt
that
is
just
a
touch
sweet
it
is
full
bodied
thick
and
syrupy
it
has
a
wooden
resiny
malt
flavor
thats
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
there
is
almost
an
umami
note
oak
and
leather
are
detected
its
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
old
ale
overall
this
was
a
really
solid
beer
a
really
solid
version
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
beer
and
near
spot
on
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
certainly
a
beer
i
will
have
over
and
over
again
tons
of
flavor
and
aromas
to
enjoy
entirely
too
easy
to
drink
and
completely
satisfying
to
the
senses

mouthfeel
is
rich
and
there
is
nothing
off
putting
either
with
the
oak
or
alcohol
drinkability
is
good
this
could
seem
like
a
good
session
beer
for
the
unwary
i
would
imagine
that
aging
would
bring
out
even
more
flavors
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
is
quite
enjoyable
with
some
light
caramel
malt
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
fruity
ester
peach
apricot
and
some
caramel
malt
additional
notes
of
dry
fruit
and
more
pronounced
presence
of
sweet
malt
would
have
made
this
more
enjoyable
carbonation
is
good
with
an
average
body
and
no
noticeable
alcohol

and

this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
occasions
as
special
as
a
weekend
an
interesting
beer
okay
more
of
a
review
than
that
poured
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
hues
of
amber
and
mahogany
as
well
the
head
was
barely
offwhite
streaks
of
a
yellowishbrown
mixed
into
the
bubbles
the
nose
was
completely
dominated
by
notes
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
and
a
faint
hint
of
green
raisins
the
first
blush
revealed
more
of
the
bourbon
barrel
notes
and
a
smooth
finish
the
moutfeel
was
rich
and
creamy
not
too
bad
and
i
wonder
what
a
little
aging
would
do
for
it
d
very
interesting
and
pretty
complex
for
the
style
im
a
big
fan
of
smuttynose
and
this
just
shows
off
their
ability
to
put
a
distinct
spin
on
a
beer
style
that
has
been
done
unremarkably
by
so
many
that
said
its
a
definite
sipper
and
i
wouldnt
call
it
balanced
given
its
spicyalcoholic
characteristics
but
its
very
tasty
nonetheless
similar
to
gearys
hsa
this
poured
a
clear
mahogany
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
brown
sugar
and
bready
yeast
and
almond
with
a
bit
of
whole
wheat
or
fresh
barley
it
tasted
simple
at
first
but
had
a
lot
of
suble
complexity
dominant
flavors
were
brown
sugar
and
creamy
yeast
but
it
also
had
banana
and
caramelized
sugar
crème
brulee
crust
and
fresh
barley
along
with
a
bit
of
cherry
bourbon
oak
and
alcohol
it
was
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
sweet
aftertaste
with
some
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
not
like
a
typical
old
ale
but
more
like
a
strong
brown
ale
it
had
great
body
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
despite
noticeable
alcohol
if
the
subtle
complexities
of
this
became
more
noticeable
with
age
that
would
really
help
round
this
beer
and
make
it
delicious
needs
some
age
i
think
we
all
agree
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
that
will
stay
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
i
finish
the
bottle
so
you
can
say
it
is
drinkable
d
smuttys
big
beers
have
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
is
a
bulls
eye
thanks
to
both
barleywinebrewer
and
joepais
for
samples
of
this
i
love
this
now
and
im
really
glad
i
have
some
to
age
i
think
it
will
get
even
better
drinkability
suffers
a
tad
from
the
alcohol
and
the
bitterness
seems
a
bit
green
at
this
point
stash
this
one
away
for
a
year
and
it
will
only
get
better
as
it
is
im
a
fan
of
english
strong
ales
anyway
and
this
one
certainly
gets
my
motor
running
nice
beer
and
major
kudos
to
smutty
for
releasing
a
fairly
underrepresented
style
in
their
big
beer
series
because
of
the
oversweetness
the
decent
carbonation
cannot
pull
the
big
bodys
weight
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
it
just
isnt
smuttynoses
finest
they
come
out
with
beers
that
are
much
better
than
this
the
beer
is
very
sweet
actually
quite
sour
high
alcohol
content
that
comes
through
i
hear
that
this
is
better
if
you
sip
and
savor
but
for
a
first
go
it
was
alright
pours
a
clear
brown
that
had
ruby
hues
when
held
to
light
creme
head
nose
is
a
bit
hot
slight
fruity
sweet
tones
flavor
is
sweet
with
woody
tones
comes
off
a
bit
hot
as
well
muted
wood
tones
it
seems
now
that
i
ponder
it
kind
of
chalky
a
bit
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
a
bit
lower
on
carbonation
this
is
nice
to
drink
but
i
think
it
needs
a
good
bit
of
time
i
develop
its
complexities
drinkability
certainly
worth
a
try
fairly
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
i
hear
smuttynose
has
since
revamped
the
recipe
and
even
called
in
some
portsoaked
oak
chips
so
ill
try
to
snag
myself
up
a
bottle
of
that
cant
help
but
compare
this
to
the
ruben
the
jets
that
i
just
had
many
similarities
cant
speak
to
rtj
as
an
is
or
this
as
a
english
strong
ale
this
one
is
lighter
in
color
a
midrange
amber
with
reddish
hues
far
less
lacing
observed
while
malty
and
sweetness
are
its
keynotes
the
nose
is
quite
timid
the
flavor
is
really
nice
malty
maple
and
caramel
but
none
of
the
cocoa
replace
with
tangy
butterscotch
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
the
flavors
are
simple
and
the
taste
lingers
some
but
nothing
heavy
quite
a
reasonable
drinker
especially
at
7
abv
recommended
as
a
side
note
this
mellows
and
becomes
nicely
less
bitey
and
a
bit
sweeter
as
it
warms

its
very
tasty
nonetheless
thanks
to
rochefort10nh
for
giving
the
chance
to
try
this
one
d
i
really
like
this
beer
but
the
drinkability
is
maybe
just
slightly
lower
than
it
could
be
due
to
the
strength
of
the
flavors
and
alcohol
feel
good
beer
but
not
what
i
had
expected
a
nice
old
ale
for
those
looking
for
one
that
isnt
overwhelmingly
sweet
just
balanced
right
enough
to
make
finishing
a
bomber
possible
brew
pours
to
a
somewhat
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
nice
sized
light
tan
head
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
roasted
and
dark
malts
burn
brown
sugar
caramel
fruit
plum
pear
and
a
nice
alcohol
scent
slight
wine
like
smell
the
flavors
here
seem
to
be
a
little
raw
in
my
opinion
seems
like
they
need
to
settle
out
a
bit
as
the
alcohol
flavor
seems
a
little
hot
while
that
flavor
seems
to
be
a
little
hot
the
rest
of
the
flavors
though
raw
are
nice
roasted
malts
chocolate
caramel
plum
and
raisin
seem
to
come
to
mind
as
i
said
earlier
the
alcohol
flavor
is
there
and
seems
to
really
to
be
coming
out
as
the
brew
warms
nice
warming
feeling
growing
on
me
as
i
make
my
way
through
this
one
it
feels
like
it
would
be
bigger
than
7
i
will
pick
up
another
one
of
these
and
sit
on
it
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
does
in
a
year
or
so
soft
mouthfeel
and
more
of
that
alluring
fruity
taste
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
caramel
maple
plums
and
fig
come
together
to
create
an
amazing
beer
theres
only
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
that
adds
another
layer
to
the
malty
sweetness
but
keeps
everything
in
check
from
becoming
cloying
not
your
prototypical
old
ale
but
a
great
ale
nonetheless
flavor
is
huge
and
tasty
as
well
tons
of
malt
and
woody
alcoholic
notes
that
again
remind
me
of
whiskey
also
fruity
almost
like
a
belgian
dubbel
touch
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
pretty
deep
layered
beer
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
chewy
and
almost
sticky
carbonation
is
kept
to
a
good
mediumlow
level
youve
got
to
sip
this
one
im
actually
surprised
its
only
7
abv
thought
it
would
have
been
higher
that
said
its
absolutely
delicious
and
this
bomber
will
do
me
good
complaints
notwithstanding
an
accurate
representation
of
its
smaller
sibling
bomber
from
ricks
alexandria
va
let
it
warm
up
so
that
you
can
really
take
everything
in

and

with
carb
bubble
streams
and
a
thin
pond
head
from
this
bomber
bottle
into
my
trois
pistoles
goblet
this
is
s
tough
one
to
get
a
handle
on
at
first
subtle
sugary
sweetness
both
in
the
nose
and
in
taste
nice
malty
flavor
some
cocoa
notes
slight
bittersweetness
nice
full
mouthfeel
overall
a
bit
cloying
even
for
a
guy
who
likes
stuff
on
the
sweet
side
a
bit
too
sweet
even
for
me
from
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
very
cloudy
and
ugly
dull
copper
color
smells
boozy
and
sweet
with
musty
a
old
attic
aroma
first
sip
is
fruity
sweet
with
caramel
and
plums
leading
the
way
tons
of
alcohol
hotness
prevails
and
the
musty
aroma
is
also
noticeable
in
the
flavor
while
smuttynose
has
also
brewed
some
great
beers
their
big
bottle
series
has
definitely
captured
my
attention
a
hearty
1pt
6oz
bottle
this
guy
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
with
honey
color
and
a
good
1
and
a
half
2
finger
head
a
light
but
rich
malt
aroma
with
yeast
and
a
slight
lavender
floral
aroma
settles
in
the
nose
the
flavor
moves
towards
a
bitter
hopsweet
malt
and
is
smooth
chewy
with
plumlike
sweetsour
musty
fruit
undertones
very
drinkable
and
quite
delicious
as
the
bottle
says
age
would
probably
do
good
things
but
the
sweet
fruits
are
what
it
is
about
for
the
price
tag
great
pours
a
nice
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
thin
foamy
beige
head
roasted
malty
aroma
with
cocoachocolate
sugar
and
dark
fruit
notes
nice
choclate
malty
flavor
that
is
kind
of
similar
to
a
tootsie
roll
strong
chocolate
presence
along
with
hints
of
fig
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
slightly
sweet
with
a
spicy
dry
finish
a
good
beer
especially
if
you
like
sweet
caramal
that
said
there
is
a
decent
hop
bitterness
that
lends
some
balance
to
the
sweetness
definitely
a
sipper
notes
i
seriously
misjudged
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
2
or
so
years
ago
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
lots
of
similarities
to
oxidized
dessert
wines
madeira
tawnycolheita
ports
olorosopx
sherries
etc
i
think
its
a
little
disjointed
right
now
but
that
it
will
fall
into
place
in
the
next
6
months
or
so
seriously
good
dability
definitely
a
sipper
and
a
beer
than
in
some
ways
feels
bigger
than
its
abv
rating
drinkability
is
good
nicely
balanced
not
quite
as
much
depth
to
the
malt
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
tasty
in
the
end
this
is
a
90
alcohol
profile
which
is
too
much
for
my
enjoyment
still
i
feel
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
as
a
change
from
the
ordinary
this
beer
is
dangerous
because
it
is
so
tasty
and
is
a
somewhat
high
abv
but
compared
to
other
beers
like
it
brown
shugga
india
brown
ale
it
is
not
too
bad
in
the
booze
department
an
enjoyable
beer
definitely
for
the
malt
fans
complex
along
with
plenty
of
roasty
malts
recommended
well
the
regular
old
brown
dog
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
so
im
pretty
excited
to
try
this
one
robd
pours
a
reddish
brown
copper
color
with
nice
clarity
and
a
large
and
slightly
sticky
tan
head
rich
nose
of
banana
figs
brown
sugar
soaked
wood
raison
and
sweet
bready
malt
rich
in
initial
profile
as
well
full
body
grainy
with
sweetness
but
still
i
dont
find
it
overpowering
or
cloying
this
beer
is
big
and
all
its
malty
good
is
still
slightly
balanced
by
a
crisp
bitterness
mid
palate
raisons
and
lots
of
em
on
the
finish
and
into
the
smokey
sweet
caramel
malty
aftertaste
good
beer
definitely
lived
up
to
my
expectations
this
beer
would
pair
nicely
with
food
food
bigger
than
this
beer
that
is
d
overall
drinkability
is
high
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
very
well
hid
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
by
smuttynose
d
a
wonderful
brew
that
has
a
nice
kick
great
big
version
of
a
brown
ale
buy
more

slowly
into
swirly
foamy

atop

malty

another
kickass
smuttynose
beer
had
on
tap
at
track
84
on
12809
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
translucent
garnet
color
with
a
tight
half
inch
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
consistent
skim
of
foam
nose
was
spicey
malty
toasted
grain
and
a
suggestion
of
dark
fruit
taste
was
spicey
lots
of
nutmeg
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
and
a
bit
of
booze
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
winter
warmer
but
more
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
lively
with
some
acidity
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
a
great
sipper
i
really
enjoyed
savoring
this
brew
another
great
big
beer
from
smutty
mouthfeel
is
good
some
good
carbonation
cleans
the
palate
and
keeps
sugars
from
being
to
cloying
a
real
drinker
the
22
oz
disappeared
really
quick
for
me
grab
this
while
it
lasts
another
winner
from
this
brewery
not
bad
overall
but
the
alcohol
isnt
wellhidden
could
be
more
enjoyable
with
age
and
id
recommend
aging
it
before
you
consume
i
didnt
get
much
out
of
this
i
guess
i
expected
a
little
more
punch
but
im
not
well
versed
in
english
strong
ales
so
i
will
need
to
revisit
the
style
this
beer
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
nicely
carbinated
and
quite
mellow
body
is
creamy
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
creamy
palate
finish
suffers
from
boozy
heat
i
can
see
why
this
years
robd
has
gotten
the
reputation
as
a
malt
bomb
i
taste
malt
and
peanuts
caramel
little
bit
of
a
banana
taste
in
there
too
i
also
taste
a
dash
of
semisweet
chocolate
sweet
without
being
overbearingly
so
has
kind
of
a
smokey
a
little
boozey
barrel
aged
quality
about
it
little
bit
of
hop
presence
for
balance
with
no
bitterness
no
sharp
aftertaste
smooth
all
the
way
through
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
to
add
to
the
mouthfeel
but
thats
a
small
complaint
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
i
can
see
why
the
style
is
described
as
barleywine
lite
i
have
to
confess
im
eating
spicy
meatballs
with
it
and
its
doing
a
great
job
of
punching
through
the
spicyness
without
being
overbearing
another
awesome
beer
from
the
smutty
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
mellow
crystal
malt
scent
with
a
slight
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
warmth
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
an
alcohol
filled
taste
that
boasts
mostly
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
does
have
some
fruit
character
but
its
hard
to
put
this
one
down
definately
a
sipper
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
slow
drinker
that
would
best
be
served
at
a
later
date
its
tastes
quite
young
and
powerful
the
alcohol
needs
time
to
mellow
out
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
very
faint
head
aroma
smells
like
the
inside
of
a
barrel
warehouse
of
a
bourbon
distillery
with
oak
and
malts
making
me
feel
very
intrigued
bourbon
barrel
flavors
are
found
in
the
taste
as
well
along
with
some
dark
fruits
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
although
it
was
very
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
extemely
pleased
d
great
drinking
brown
rich
malty
sweet
and
a
dream
going
down
dark
amber
in
color
with
little
head
to
speak
of
almost
nonexistent
aroma
of
dark
fruit
reminiscent
of
black
cherries
the
taste
is
quite
extraordinary
strawberries
give
way
to
black
cherries
that
cascade
down
leaving
behind
an
oily
slick
dark
fruit
tang
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
for
an
above
average
abv
alcohol
sneaks
its
head
around
from
behind
the
fruit
at
times
but
never
fully
reveals
itself
winelike
in
character
and
enjoyable
as
an
after
dinner
brew
prelude
to
poop
strong

shmong

a
battle
in
the
belly
to
keep
down
after
several
sessions
apertif
to
queaf
i
felt
like
this
drank
a
little
tougher
than
7
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
night
it
seemed
like
a
while
since
they
had
put
this
beer
out
so
i
was
pleased
to
see
it
around
again
apparently
the
recipe
has
changed
this
year
redlight
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
tan
lacing
nose
is
really
big
on
wood
and
alcohol
although
a
hint
of
fruit
lies
underneath
it
all
caramel
sweetness
hits
the
palate
first
followed
by
some
bitter
hop
then
ends
on
a
very
boozy
almost
acrid
note
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
in
your
face
i
had
a
tough
time
getting
through
this
beer
from
what
i
can
remember
the
07
bottling
was
more
preferable
maybe
this
one
needs
some
age
as
the
label
suggests
notes
good
but
not
great
pretty
tasty
this
is
a
little
boozy
to
be
exceptionaly
drinkable
i
had
trouble
getting
through
the
bomber
solid
brew
but
i
prefer
the
loweralcohol
incarnation
grab
a
bottle
while
they
are
around
i
imagine
this
would
age
very
well
and
mellow
out
over
a
612
month
period
i
can
just
imagine
what
this
would
taste
like
with
that
slight
edge
taken
off
of
it
yum
nice
rubybrown
color
leathery
peat
nose
nutty
sherrylike
surprisingly
this
beer
is
not
all
that
smooth
its
not
brash
but
the
flavor
is
fairly
sharp
none
of
that
rich
velvety
stuff
not
much
residual
sugar
again
notes
of
sherry
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
is
a
nice
beer
not
something
thats
going
to
blow
your
hair
back
but
a
good
mellow
wintertime
sipper
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
props
to
smuttynose
as
always
d
excellent
brew
and
look
forward
to
the
year
of
big
releases
by
the
brewery
worth
the
effort
to
find
very
smooth
drinking
beer
another
great
release
in
the
smutty
big
beer
series
i
put
aside
a
bottle
that
i
will
look
forward
to
drinking
next
winter
this
one
is
perfect
for
a
very
cold
new
england
night
with
the
snow
falling
m
d
soft
carbonation
fuller
body
rather
appropriate
for
the
style
and
the
flavours
a
nice
beer
and
another
good
offering
from
smuttynose
particularly
in
the
big
beer
series
which
hasnt
really
done
me
wrong
yet
poured
a
deep
brown
with
nice
tannish
head
good
carbonation
and
a
good
looking
brew
nose
is
pretty
hot
you
can
tell
this
beer
has
some
alcohol
to
it
some
dried
fruits
caramel
and
even
some
oak
perhaps
taste
is
pretty
hot
from
beginning
to
end
you
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
dried
fruits
caramel
malts
and
much
more
mouthfeel
is
noce
warm
and
very
coating
on
the
mouth
good
beer
this
is
a
good
effort
with
a
lot
going
on
im
guessing
a
little
time
may
be
helpful
smutty
never
disappoints
there
are
some
really
good
flavors
in
this
complex
ale
unfortunately
they
are
clearly
unbalanced
due
to
the
alcohol
and
hop
profiles
youth
this
really
old
brown
dog
needs
to
lay
down
for
another
year
this
is
one
i
would
love
to
revisit
once
it
mellows
a
little
more
pours
a
crystal
clear
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
thin
head
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
brown
sugar
cherries
dark
dried
fruits
vanilla
some
oak
or
smoke
too
very
malty
nose
very
little
if
any
hop
presence
taste
is
sweet
with
dark
fruits
toffee
sugar
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
warming
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamysyrupy
body
is
medium
carbonation
is
ample
another
great
brew
from
an
underrated
brewery
good
sipper
but
drinkability
wanes
as
complexity
decreases
and
bourbon
dominates
would
like
to
cellar
some
of
this
to
see
how
it
ages
overall
another
awesome
brew
from
smuttynose
an
old
favorite
brought
back
in
even
more
glory
this
is
going
to
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
cellar
and
stand
the
test
of
several
tasty
years
im
buying
even
more
than
a
case
much
softer
and
smoother
than
i
remember
it
fresh
seems
to
have
taken
on
a
lovely
english
nut
brown
ale
persona
quite
delicious
wish
id
cellared
more
of
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
smell
is
definitely
the
highpoint
but
its
good
allaround
fruity
and
sweet
dried
fig
nose
baked
bean
with
brown
sugar
taste
with
some
herbal
and
salty
hops
aftertaste
is
long
and
bitter
after
a
sweet
fruity
start
that
dries
out
quickly
medium
thin
mouthfeel
that
goes
well
with
an
alcohol
bite
and
warmth
a
sipper
or
great
with
a
steak
stew
or
roast
give
it
a
try
the
taste
is
so
different
from
the
nose
it
is
rough
bitter
blast
of
grapefruit
citrus
that
gives
you
a
slight
sour
bite
but
is
balanced
by
a
caramel
brown
sugar
sweetness
that
finishes
slightly
boozy
and
soft
on
the
palate
excellent
sipper
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
never
tried
this
when
it
was
young
i
may
or
may
not
pick
this
up
again
if
i
see
it
dont
get
me
wrong
for
the
style
this
was
pretty
good
for
me
but
this
is
one
of
those
styles
that
i
feel
is
very
hard
to
nail
perfectly
smuttynose
has
done
a
good
job
with
this
inaugural
version
according
to
the
brewers
notes
they
arent
100
happy
with
how
it
turned
out
but
i
think
it
turned
out
pretty
well
if
brown
ales
are
your
favorite
style
then
really
old
brown
dog
is
worth
an
enthusiastic
two
paws
up
recommended
d
i
think
the
drinkability
is
about
on
par
with
the
abv
a
bit
less
than
a
session
beer
but
its
nice
to
enjoy
and
i
could
definitely
drink
multiple
glasses
drinkability
now
that
this
has
had
a
chance
to
settle
down
a
number
of
posters
said
it
was
unbalanced
when
freshly
bottled
it
is
drinking
very
nicely
quite
different
and
a
solid
achievement
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
which
leaves
some
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
vanilla
toffe
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
roasty
tones
toffeecaramel
the
alcohol
is
basically
nonexistent
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
brew
goes
down
very
smooth
another
awesome
brew
from
smuttynose
thanks
joe
drank
lite
and
easy
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
winner
bombers
i
am
not
certain
if
i
liked
this
more
now
or
when
it
was
fresh
but
regardless
it
is
delicious
would
like
to
see
more
of
this
very
clear
and
reddish
brown
the
chucky
light
tan
foam
was
very
longlasting
and
formed
thick
lacing
aromas
of
brown
sugar
cocoa
dark
chocolate
bread
crust
toffe
and
faint
alcohol
low
bitterness
with
lots
of
malty
sweetness
faint
hop
leaf
with
alcohol
throughout
and
a
toffee
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
average
carbonation
with
some
warmth
and
a
decent
texture
although
it
didnt
quite
come
together
for
me
the
way
it
should
it
was
still
enjoyable
and
had
some
nice
malt
presence
nicely
constructed
i
think
the
six
months
in
the
basement
helped
to
mellow
things
out
if
you
find
it
around
id
recommend
a
try
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
flavorful
beer
the
only
downfall
is
that
it
isnt
memorable
this
is
another
gem
from
smuttynose
i
certainly
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
overall
its
good
but
its
really
close
to
old
brown
dog
although
its
bottle
conditioned
i
couldnt
really
tell
but
there
was
a
little
bit
of
sticky
yeast
left
in
the
bottle
maybe
this
one
is
best
if
the
dog
is
laid
down
to
rest
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
im
not
so
sure
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
old
ale
style
but
it
is
certainly
an
excellent
englishbrownaletothesecondpower
like
almost
all
of
the
beers
that
ive
had
from
smuttynose
brewing
co
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
an
evening
whether
its
sipping
slowly
or
pounding
down
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
fairly
low
carbonation
making
this
pretty
smooth
and
helps
give
this
a
good
drinkability
i
think
obd
is
a
great
beer
this
on
the
other
hand
not
so
much
it
looked
like
a
brown
ale
but
upon
tasting
it
turns
into
a
bad
brownbarleywine
hybrid
and
that
says
a
lot
if
its
only
7
abv
there
were
some
cocoalike
malts
trying
to
blend
with
sweeter
fruitier
malts
and
it
just
didnt
work
poor
balance
here
no
good
pours
a
clear
redbrown
thin
tan
head
nice
lacing
leaves
a
solid
ring
around
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
bit
of
toffee
very
fruity
alcohol
is
present
bready
malt
taste
is
toffee
some
chocolate
quite
rich
roasty
bitter
finish
some
alcohol
bread
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
warms
as
it
goes
down
not
bad
neat
shot
at
a
lighter
old
ale
thanks
stan
good
brew
not
their
best
this
is
one
tasty
beer
that
hides
its
7
alcohol
very
well
i
think
that
the
taste
was
overwhelmed
by
alcohol
which
isnt
really
acceptable
in
a
7
ale
in
my
opinion
there
were
all
of
those
malty
flavors
present
with
a
bit
of
a
dark
berry
thing
as
well
but
the
finish
was
too
boozy
for
me
to
appreciate
it
sorry
to
say
as
i
rather
like
the
regular
obd
and
i
love
sn
in
general
as
well
as
the
beautiful
label
i
think
this
is
the
least
of
the
big
beer
series
that
ive
tried
smuttonator
wheat
wine
farmhouse
regardless
thanks
franchise
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
random
somewhat
copper
color
white
lacey
head
on
top
malty
somewhat
sharp
and
lactic
aroma
decent
enough
malty
flavor
slightly
robust
with
a
faint
alcohol
twinge
tastes
like
an
amped
up
version
of
their
regular
brown
though
out
of
balance
ok
mouthfeel
rather
ho
hum
overall
for
me
i
was
expecting
more
to
tell
you
the
truth
all
their
big
beer
series
beers
i
have
had
have
been
greatthis
one
lacks
a
lot
recommended
bottom
line
im
very
impressed
with
this
old
ale
offering
from
smuttynose
and
can
easily
recommend
it
see
it
buy
it
and
sip
on
it
thanks
again
joe
quite
a
tasty
beer
now
i
dont
think
this
is
one
that
i
would
age
not
much
would
change
imo
and
it
is
very
good
now
a
good
enjoyable
old
ale
not
the
best
ive
had
but
very
nice
i
especially
liked
how
it
opened
up
with
some
air
temperature
and
found
it
to
be
much
more
enjoyable
more
like
an
old
ale
once
it
did
so
some
sharp
white
cheddar
would
have
been
perfect
with
this
as
well
as
anything
nutty
perhaps
a
praline
just
like
olive
the
really
old
brown
dog
on
the
label
this
hit
its
stride
with
some
good
ol
time
be
patient
let
it
warm
up
to
room
temps
and
enjoy
this
was
pretty
good
stuff
overall
id
tone
down
the
alcohol
presence
s
bit
to
make
this
a
bit
more
drinkable
and
balance
out
the
flavour
a
bit
more
which
could
make
this
one
a
really
good
brew
that
said
its
still
good
in
its
own
right
also
i
cant
not
mention
even
though
its
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
contents
of
the
bottle
the
truly
awesome
label
for
this
one
its
a
simple
classy
tribute
to
the
great
and
now
late
smutty
mascot
and
is
simply
one
of
the
best
beer
labels
ive
ever
seen
overall
this
isnt
an
unpleasant
beer
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
this
was
not
an
appetizing
looking
beer
when
served
kind
of
muddy
brown
looking
its
possible
it
was
the
tail
end
of
the
keg
there
was
a
nice
head
that
went
to
a
ring
in
a
bit
it
smelled
ok
lots
of
malt
nothing
huge
what
i
liked
about
this
beer
was
the
balanced
flavor
that
stayed
right
through
to
the
finish
there
was
a
pretty
decent
malt
flavor
to
it
i
rather
liked
this
beer
although
i
dont
have
much
experieince
with
the
style
its
quite
nice
on
a
quiet
night
on
the
back
porch
or
sipping
by
the
fire
with
a
good
book
but
id
imagine
its
drinkability
would
be
limited
in
the
pub
setting
but
at
7
thats
to
be
expected
id
imagine
it
would
pair
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
but
glazed
yams
come
to
mind
as
does
oddly
enough
maplesyrup
covered
pancakes
with
a
link
or
two
of
nicely
browned
sausage
enjoyable
worth
trying
d
better
than
old
brown
dog
but
not
by
much
i
dont
think
i
will
have
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
poured
into
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
12
tan
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
orangey
copper
brew
head
recedes
at
a
slow
to
moderate
pace
with
ample
lace
aroma
is
malt
sweetness
with
touches
of
chocolate
taste
is
surprisingly
light
on
the
grains
upfront
fruity
in
the
middle
and
comes
on
a
bit
hoppy
at
the
close
after
swallow
is
when
the
warm
really
starts
up
mouthfeel
is
oddly
thinseeming
and
drinkability
is
reasonable
but
the
afterburn
might
slow
you
down
have
to
agree
with
some
others
a
bit
of
age
would
probably
do
this
one
good
4
99
for
a
22
ounce
bomber
the
front
of
label
lets
you
know
this
brew
was
bottle
conditioned
in
2007
certaintly
a
good
bit
of
info
as
this
one
most
likely
was
designed
to
be
put
away
in
a
cool
dark
place
for
a
few
pours
medium
almond
amber
moderate
haze
cloudyness
and
sits
under
a
tightly
knit
light
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
fine
and

years
its
drinking
quite

right

d
right
now
not
much
but
i
bet
in
about
1
year
this
beer
will
be
tremendous
mouthfeel

a

body
and
oes
down
very

in

maybe
a
little
too
smooth
even
though
its
not
the
highest
abv

ive
had
it
went
down

and
the

cought
up
to
me
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
wish
it
didnt
have
the
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
took
me
bit
to
finish
this
one
off
pours
a
nice
burnt
sienna
color
with
a
hefty
light
billowy
head
tan
that
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
is
mainly
of
some
caramel
brown
malts
along
with
some
slight
almonds
and
chocolate
a
bit
of
floral
hops
hits
my
nose
as
well
but
mainly
malt
sipping
reveals
a
nice
robust
mocha
maltiness
that
almost
reminds
me
of
a
porter
however
the
body
is
a
bit
fuller
medium
with
some
nice
caramel
tones
throughout
the
sip
a
bit
of
alcohol
also
hits
my
tongue
numbing
it
on
the
tip
just
a
bit
while
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
very
smooth
aside
from
the
alcohol
tingle
i
didnt
drink
this
at
a
very
cold
temp
probably
58
degrees
f
but
very
enjoyable
this
will
help
my
hold
em
skills
okay
maybe
not
but
very
nice
offering
pours
a
twofingered
light
tan

that
slowly
fades

beer
let
this
sit
in
your
cellar
until
it
matures
not
bad
but
seems
the
recipe
has
been
pumped
up
for
this
year
its
acually
much
bigger
than
the
07
version
this
one
is
much
bolder
huge
malt
verging
on
an

but
slightly
more

mouthfeel
could
be
a

but
unfortunately
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
a
very
nice
tasting
brew
with
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
as
all
smuttynose
brews
are
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
not
as
strong
as
some
old
ales
ive
had
but
much
more

and

a

the

the

the

not
sure
where
the
brewer
was
trying
to
go
with
this
one
being
that
it
is
bottle
condition
and
relatively
high
abv
i
am
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
rip

i
recommend
trying
this

right

its
just
ok

d
its
smooth
and
tastes
good
just
not
something
id
tell
everyone
to
run
out
and
hunt
for
after
drinking
most
of
the
22oz
bottle
you
definitely
start
to
feel
the
alcohol
level
overall
its
a
fair
offering
almost
seems
like
itd
be
better
suited
in
their
regular
rotation
instead
of
its
big
beer
designation
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
its
just
not
going
to
be
able
to
hold
my
interest
to
the
point
that
would
make
me
go
back
for
more
drinkability
this
is
a
heavier
and
meatier
brown
ale
that
is
outside
normal
session
ranges
but
this
was
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
it
tastes
just
like
a
brown
ale
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
youre
hit
with
a
massive
amount
of
hot
alcohol
im
going
to
lay
a
few
of
these
down
and
revisit
in
a
year
or
so
its
not
undrinkable
now
but
im
sure
it
could
be
much
better
hopefully
time
will
temper
the
out
of
control
alcohol
no
matter
how
old
it
is
this
dog
can
hunt
the
dense
malt
presence
lends
a
mature
air
to
the
overall
character
leaving
a
tasty
mix
of
old
and
scotch
ales
despite
a
muted
but
credible
abv
its
an
easily
drinkable
maltfest
no
it
doesnt
soar
among
the
clouds
but
its
salt
of
the
earth
and
that
makes
it
one
of
mans
better
friends

a

never
have
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
ale
smell
and
this
one
is
about
the
same
as
the
rest
its
got
flavor
that
is
for
sure
not
bad
at
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
real
smooth

still
had

good
stuff
o
well
ive
had
this
one
on
tap
and
have
brought
it
home
in
bottles
over
the
last
few
years
this
year
seems
to
be
less
chocolaty
cherries
still
good
beer
that
represents
the
style
well
i
work
in
this
part
of
mi
a
lot
so
i
get
to
stay
up
with
the
brewery
more
than
others
jackhammer
is
always
one
of
my
favorites
even
with
this
being
slightly
off
compared
to
other
years
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
a
beer
it
was
also
a
good
and
pretty
solid
example
of
the
style
none
of
the
flavors
or
aromas
seemed
out
of
place
and
they
both
had
a
good
amount
of
complexity
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
for
the
style
it
was
smooth
not
too
boozy
and
the
flavors
did
a
job
at
holding
my
attention
with
their
complexity
i
might
be
inclined
to
drink
a
couple
bottles
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
in
the
mourning
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
and
complex
it
was
i
also
really
liked
the
appearance
its
a
good
looking
old
ale
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
the
only
thing
that
seemed
off
for
the
style
and
i
think
it
would
much
better
suit
this
beer
if
it
was
a
little
thicker
with
a
little
less
carbonation
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
pretty
affordable
old
ale
which
isnt
too
common
for
the
style
i
will
be
picking
up
a
couple
more
to
put
in
the
cellar
i
think
they
may
have
some
potential
for
ageing
and
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
its
a
nice
example
of
what
an
old
ale
should
be
like
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
didnt
have
my
hopes
set
too
high
since
arbor
can
be
pretty
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
turned
out
pretty
good
and
i
thought
it
represented
the
style
nicely
its
not
going
to
take
the
place
of
bells
third
coast
old
ale
as
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
its
still
a
good
and
solid
example
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
thanks
for
the
tasty
old
ale
arbor
brewing
company
o
overall
it
was
alright
id
have
again
but
not
very
often
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
have
enjoyed
it
many
times
at
the
brewpub
and
would
definitely
get
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
i
would
most
likely
buy
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
shelf
for
a
good
price
12
a
6pack
and
4
a
12
oz
serving
a
pretty
amazing
old
ale
very
clean
but
the
flavors
keep
up
with
complexities
and
making
it
interesting
to
drink
going
to
throw
the
rest
of
this
bottle
at
a
12
month
old
cheddar
a
sleeper
beer
one
that
most
beer
geeks
are
missing
out
on
would
drink
again
would
be
a
good
beer
to
switch
things
up
with
d
its
really
a
decent
sipper
obviously
not
something
to
session
but
something
to
contemplate
during
a
cold
michigan
winter
overall
its
pretty
much
a
hit
from
a
brewery
that
tends
to
be
kinda
hitormiss
for
me
dark
caramel
color
with
a
thin
head
that
hung
on
for
a
good
amount
of
time
lacing
fails
to
stick
to
the
glass
i
left
the
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottle
a
good
aroma
for
the
style
i
smell
toffee
grass
gingerbread
and
some
yeast
esters
unfortunately
the
flavor
does
not
live
up
to
the
aroma
a
little
too
much
caramel
malt
for
my
taste
tastes
a
tad
artificial
but
is
not
too
bad
bready
flavor
with
a
touch
of
ginger
mildly
hopped
with
just
a
faint
touch
of
spice
and
pine
no
sign
of
alcohol
so
close
to
having
a
good
mouthfeel
but
is
just
a
little
too
thin
nicely
carbonated
however
a
decent
old
ale
that
just
falls
short
in
a
couple
of
areas
drinks
averagely
too
many
dominant
offflavors
some
good
aspects
mesh
together
with
those
to
make
an
average
beer
everything
is
just
ok
nothing
offesnive
just
very
subdued
makes
it
pretty
much
a
one
and
done
d
i
dont
know
about
calling
this
an
old
ale
but
its
a
nice
belgianstyle
something
d
more
like
a
winter
warmer
than
an
old
ale
but
quite
nice
d
could
drink
more
then
you
would
think
cuz
of
the
9abv
hands
down
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
arbor
brewing
company
overall
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
it
isnt
completely
terrible
but
doesnt
have
too
much
going
for
it
overall
one
of
the
shittiest
beers
ive
ever
had
it
doesnt
have
even
one
redeeming
quality
another
brewery
im
done
with
taste
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
cloves
are
really
strong
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
beer
even
though
it
obviously
isnt
alcohol
is
mild
and
warms
the
throat

turgid
smells
slightly
hoppy
and
vegetal
like
wilted
kale
sweet

odor
underneath
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
an
old
ale
but
something
is
a
bit
off
flavor
has
a
strong
malt
base
recognizable
as
a
member
of
the
style
but
on
top
of
that
is
a
pervasive
vegetal
tartness
that
isnt
particularly
appetizing
its
either
from
the
hops
or
unwelcome
bacteria
and
either
way
its
not
good
warming
alcohol
evident
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
wet
cardboard
like
taste
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
arbor
is
usually
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
one
is
a
miss
hard
to
say
if
its
a
miss
because
of
their
beercraft
or
because
of
their
sanitation
procedures
but
either
way
its
a
beer
theyre
selling
in
bottles
and
that
doesnt
taste
good
apple

box

cocktail
aroma
with
plastic
off

alternately
roasty
and
medicinal
roasty
ashy

symptoms
of

the
body
is
way
overcarbonated
and
foams
up
with
each
sip
something
is
amiss
here
and
i
bought
this
bottle
near
the
source
in

the

for

this

from
the

i

this
one
did
seem

as
far
as
old

go
this
one
really
just
isnt
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
that
ive
had
worth
a
try
if
your
from
the
area
but
not
something
i
will
buy
again
upon
first
taste
you
notice
the
sweetness
with
hints
of
butterscotch
no
hop
presense
at
all
carbonation
too
high
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
soda
if
you
can
make
it
to
the
4th
beer
though
they
start
to
taste
better
poured
a
very
dark
amber
which
seemed
highly
carbonated
and
had
a
thick
light
brown
head
that
stayed
foamy
for
awhile
smells
sweet
almost
belgiany
with
maybe
a
little
hop
in
there
the
flavor
is
a
rich
olde
ale
consistant
with
others
that
i
have
tried
and
quite
good
its
sweet
with
a
bitter
finish
and
a
bit
of
a
tart
aftertaste
its
mediumbodied
in
the
mouth
and
quite
drinkable
seems
pretty
gentle
for
8
5
and
well
worth
the
try
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
roasty
bitter
pretty
tasty
for
alcohol
content
overall
quite
a
nice
old
ale
from
arbor
d
for
the
aftertaste
i
would
not
revisit
not
a
bad
beer
despite
the
negative
comments
i
am
sure
some
people
would
like
it
d
i
dig
this
beer
i
shouldve
bought
more
to
sit
on
a
bottle
or
two
it
was
good
but
i
didnt
really
get
much
of
the
rich
caramel
malt
flavors
that
characterize
an
old
ale
to
me
came
off
fruitier
like
a
barleywine
and
hopped
like
an
american
version
the
hops
still
seemed
grassier
but
there
wasnt
much
flavor
but
bitterness
lots
of
lace
and
a
creamy
head
on
top
of
a
brownish
amber
body
an
aroma
of
musty
yeast
spicey
and
fruity
with
a
noteable
aftertaste
chocolate
malts
caramel
barley
warming
alcohol
would
be
a
feature
in
a
sidebyside
with
kuhennen
ales
not
as
satsifying
as
other
old
ales
i
have
trade
not
the
real
thing
but
nice
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
from
the
perspective
of
its
enticing
quaffable
qualities
but
it
does
not
beckon
the
imbiber
with
the
desire
to
sip
yet
again
an
again
to
discover
its
hidden
mysteries

a

powerful
beer
at

abv
it
was
big
to
say
the
least
poured
out
from
the
tap
to
a
dark
brownish
orange
color
with
nearly
no
head
low
carbonation
aromas
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
was
malty
with
some
fermented
citrus
notes
and
dry
grain
mouthfeel
was
light
but
maintained
a
consistance
about
itself
drinkability
is
fair
wasnt
all
that
impressed
the
mouthfeel
was
very
full
deep
red
with
amber
highlights
not
much
head
to
speak
of
hint
of
malt
sweetness
on
the
nose
but
its
a
clean
sweetness
no
unusual
esters
going
on
here
flavor
at
first
has
a
pronounced
fruity
sweetness
almost
like
cherries
then
a
warm
alcohol
note
is
followed
by
a
strong
bitterness
and
astringent
finish
a
fairly
well
balanced
big
beer
slàinte
a
nice
old
ale
and
definitely
a
true
winter
warmer
needs
to
be
served
at
much
warmer
temps
though
luckily
it
is
only
available
in
a
10
oz
ministein
that
warms
up
fast
good
value
for
the
price
less
than
4
but
id
choose
arbors
terminator
instead
for
a
malt
experience
okay
i
often
order
one
and
then
the
other
conclusion
not
all
that
inspired
but
not
bad
either
i
just
drank
the
bestefar
last
night
and
it
was
a
bit
odd
but
much
more
complex
and
intriguing
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
if
i
brewed
it
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
bit
stranger
and
interesting
o
pretty
good
festive
ale
recommended
yes
its
miles
away
from
bois
and
kuhnhenn
but
its
still
a
great
brew
wow
what
an
interesting
and
delicious
beer
one
heck
of
a
take
on
holiday
beer
dark
dark
brown
in
color
hardly
any
head
but
it
doesnt
need
one
to
impress
me
its
rich
and
silky
looking
more
like
a
big
porter
than
an
american
old
ale
with
minimal
light
moving
through
the
nose
is
oddly
smoked
much
like
the
bestefar
they
make
with
some
honey
sweetness
and
a
huge
roasty
body
dark
and
chalky
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
short
lived
campfire
vibe
for
a
minute
before
bitter
dark
and
finally
sweet
dark
malt
flavors
come
in
waves
the
finish
is
dry
for
the
looks
and
style
with
a
sharp
fusel
alcohol
untidiness
i
like
the
complexity
depth
and
richness
of
this
beer
an
awful
lot
not
something
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
but
i
surely
appreciate
its
uniqueness
i
dont
get
the
tartness
others
did
this
was
smooth
all
the
way
for
me
in
what
i
can
only
imagine
to
be
freezing
cold
norwegian
winters
this
is
a
beer
i
would
want
to
have
on
hand
i
would
strongly
recommend
it
for
the
holiday
season
here
in
the
usa
it
changes
what
i
thought
old
ale
could
be
excellent
product
very
nice
almosy
desert
like
in
richness
overall
a
really
interesting
beer
that
shows
a
range
of
flavor
overall
i
do
like
it
a
good
deal
its
smooth
and
flavoursome
without
being
particularly
heavy
or
bombastic
the
faint
christmas
overtones
are
there
but
theyre
not
overt
and
it
makes
the
beer
feel
more
subtle
and
refined
than
it
might
have
good
stuff
while
i
have
no
idea
how
this
is
a
holiday
beer
i
really
liked
it
its
got
a
stout
or
strong
porter
taste
and
feel
its
certainly
not
cheap
but
it
was
very
good
o
another
very
enjoyable
dark
beer
from
hb
quite
satisfying
and
arguably
one
of
their
best
dark
ales
a
tasty
old
ale
good
fruit
malt
and
spice

a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
khaki
colored
head
which
leaves
some
nice
lace
on
the

the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
but
then
the
aroma
of
sweet
dark
fruits
raisins
and
plums
the
taste
follows
suit
there
is
a
chocolate
backbone
but
then
a
belgian
sweetness
takes
over
before
a
big
deep
flavor
of
dark
fruits
takes
place
there
are
raisins
plums
and
red
grapes
that
dance
over
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
big
and
bold
it
is
a
very
complex
solid
beer
nissefar
is
a
challenged
taste
that
circulates
around
porterlike
roots
but
with
a
seemingly
forced
aged
or
cellarlike
character
the
result
is
a
stale
and
uneven
belgiantasting
oude
bruin
type
of
beer
no
one
aspect
of
the
beer
seems
genuine
but
it
seems
to
be
an
invention
unto
itself
and
offers
a
charming
rusticity
thats
part
of
the
problem
and
part
of
the

o
i
quite
liked
this
beer

done
well
in

two
years
of

life
recommended
would
have
again
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
fairly
light
though
still
noticeable
carbonation
which
produces
a
very
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
overall
mouthfeel
phenols
and
ethanol
provide
very
slight
spiciness
appropriate
for
this
winterthemed
beer
the
finish
is
very
dry
again
seemingly
on
target
for
a
roasted
smoky
stoutlike
ale
i
always
appreciate
a
born
on
date
but
i
think
i
will
decide
when
my
beer
expires
this
was
delicious
o
as
a
winter
holiday
style
the
balance
was
spot
on
not

july
2010
bottling
overall
what
we
found
to
be
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
smoke
at
first
it
was
light
and
souring
making
for
a
cleaner
finish
but
by
the
end
it
became
an
integral
component
of
the
beers
complexity
otherwise
this
guy
is
fairly
simple
staying
true
to
style
except
for
a
few
points
when
it
veered
onto
the
pathway
of
the
porters
if
it
werent
for
the
smell
this
would
be
great
as
it
is
its
still
pretty
good
overall
after
cleaning
up
the
spillage
from
the
bottle
spewing
upon
opening
it
wasnt
shaken
and
was
opened
at
around
55f
i
proceeded
to
sample
this
bad
boy
definitely
a
strong
beer
with
a
decent
balance
between
the
complex
flavors
and
the
alcohol
content
i
dont
know
if
this
particular
bottle
was
overprimed
but
ignoring
the
exploding
bottle
opening
fiasco
this
is
a
mighty
tasty
northern
european
brew
o
overall
this
beer
was
just
alright
there
are
much
better
old
ales
out
there
and
much
better
offerings
from
haandbryggeriet
o
a
lower
alcohol
old
ale
but
it
works
fine
good
flavours
quite
the
enjoyable
effort
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
drinkable
best
saved
for
the
end
of
a
session
due
to
the
fullness
in
body
served
in
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
sweet
malty
aroma
hints
of
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
spice
taste
of
dark
malts
followed
instantly
by
a
huge
licorice
profile
chocolate
chips
and
notes
of
spice
and
a
slightly
syrupy
booziness
in
the
background
interesting
and
tasty
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
and
quite
drinkable
definitely
worth
revisiting
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
will
drink
again
sample

procured
at
øl
this
brewery
is
really
quite
special
everything
they
do
is
very
unique
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
deerp
brown
color
with
a
litter
brown
colored
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
chocolatey
aromas
blended
with
some
dark
fruits
and
stuff
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
dry
the
mouthfeel
had
a
decent
thickness
to
it
which
was
nice
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
holiday
ale
id
enjoy
having
it
again
one
day
overall
even
though
my
bottles
best
before
date
was
three
months
ago
this
is
fantastic
beer
carefully
lovingly
crafted
by
people
who
obviously
put
their
hearts
and
souls
into
their
work
i
look
forward
to
my
next
encounter
with
this
brewhopefully
with
a
fresher
bottle
and
on
a
cold
christmas
morning
i
found
this
to
be
a
really
good
porter
very
accessible
and
enjoyable
and
the
fruit
was
a
welcome
surprise
and
element
very
well
done
and
id
love
to
have
more
of
this
and
other
wares
from
haandbryggeriet
in
the
future
dthis
was
past
its
prime
but
hinted
at
a
really
solid
beer
will
try
fresh
and
rereview
overall
quite
enjoyed
this
christmas
porter
the
nose
could
be
a
little
bigger
but
it
had
plenty
of
nice
flavor
and
drank
away
quite
easily
ive
never
had
a
fresh
bottle
but
if
my
previous
experience
with
haand
is
any
indication
the
ageing
has
mellowed
out
the
carbonation
and
made
it
much
more
drinkable
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
this
was
a
winter
warmer
style
porter
quality
beer
with
a
sweetness
of
a
aged
hop
quality
afterall
the
hop
was
about
a
year
and
some
old
at
this
pine
but
hopping
resembled
something
of
a
tangerine
citrus
nice
and
sweet
chocolate
covered
citrus
palate
was
that
but
not
as
syrupy
as
expected
rather
lean
and
quick
finish
of
something
some
bright
note
of
tangerine
chocolate
clove
and
fruit
cake
sugar
dessert
and
simple
fruit
character
i
bought
the
nissefar
on
a
whim
for
christmas
festivities
my
family
is
hosting
for
the
first
time
ever
this
year
and
i
have
been
running
around
making
everything
perfect
a
huge
tree
decorations
real
garlands
candles
yard
lights
stockings
fires
in
the
fireplace
eggnog
everything
who
gets
to
host
xmas
is
a
little
bit
of
a
contentious
point
in
my
family
so
i
felt
a
lot
of
pressure
to
make
things
perfect
i
made
sure
to
point
out
the
origin
of
this
beer
to
my
norwegian
family
too
much
probably
but
in
the
end
they
were
busy
making
gingerbread
houses
and
playing
with
my
son
and
shopping
and
nissefar
ended
up
turning
from
one
of
my
holiday
touches
into
my
little
personal
moment
of
appreciation
and
for
this
purpose
it
served
admirably
and
lets
face
it
mouthfeel
etc
was
not
even
a
consideration
big
chocolately
head
with
filmy
bubbles
opaque
brown
liquid
nice
chocolate
aroma
some
winter
spices
and
pine
in
the
nose
as
well
chocolate
sweetness
some
alcohol
and
a
finish
that
reminds
me
of
prune
juice
this
is
a
slick
full
bodied
beer
that
has
low
carbonation
and
an
oily
coat
it
drinks
very
well
this
bottle
is
about
two
years
old
i
imagine
that
a
fresh
one
would
be
very
impressive
a
rather
one
dimensional
porter
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
spiceherbal
flavor
the
beer
needs
some
life
to
it
verdict
almost
worth
the
insane
price
and
definitelt
worth
trying
d
goes
down
easily
very
tasty
not
too
filling
nice
kick
nice
representation
of
style
for
me
this
is
a
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
few
rounds
drinkability
is
fantastic
i
could
enjoy
it
any
day
night
or
for
friggin
breakfast
total
yum
d
this
is
a
unique
take
on
an
american
porter
my
first
brew
from
haanbryggeriet
and
certainly
not
my
last
the
flavor
profile
begs
for
a
bigger
body
and
a
bigger
beer
but
as
it
is
it
is
quite
tasty
medium
bodied
and
very
quaffable
with
a
nice
balance
of
roasty
malt
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
and
peppery
spiciness
the
dark
fruit
notes
are
prominent
with
hints
of
sour
cherry
plum
raisin
and
fig
this
is
countered
by
the
sightly
roasted
chocolatecaramel
malt
flavor
resulting
in
a
slight
sweet
creamy
feel
mid
palate
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
peppery
spice
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
peppermint
im
also
picking
up
a
slight
medicinal
syrup
flavor
before
a
dry
and
slightly
tart
finish
very
nice
i
could
drink
this
once
but
would
not
seek
it
out
again
i
dont
see
what
is
so
xmassy
about
this
compared
to
the
more
interesting
xmas
beers
out
there
this
is
a
bit
onethemed
probably
my
least
favorite
that
ive
had
from
haandbryggeriet
which
is
all
right
since
the
rest
have
been
outstanding
hmmm
is
the
oldness
of
the
ale
giving
way
has
it
lost
so
much
in
the
3
months
that
have
passed
since
its
expiration
but
its
still
got
plenty
of
flavor
just
has
me
wondering
what
else
was
going
on
its
still
tasty
and
spicy
and
delicious
i
am
not
sure
about
this
beer
the
aroma
is
down
right
interesting
and
not
even
unpleasant
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
weird
i
could
be
convinced
that
this
wasnt
infected
and
the
weird
notes
are
simply
a
product
of
interesting
ingredient
selection
but
i
dont
think
so
note
batch
163
bottled
june
2008
d
easy
drinking
but
only
due
to
the
lowerthanaverage
body
and
thin
mouthfeel
flavors
are
balanced
well
but
they
are
just
muted
and
should
be
allowed
to
be
more
prevalent
i
prefer
bigger
holiday
ales
and
this
just
wouldnt
suffice
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
big
winter
warmer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
dark
beer
with
a
belgian
twist
on
it
making
it
worth
drinking
for
a
while
overall
this
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
found
it
to
be
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
worth
a
shot
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
porter
o
respectable
brew
with
an
interesting
taste
that
makes
for
good
conversation
but
not
my
thing
drinkability
solid
and
interesting
and
though
i
would
try
it
again
the
price
and
limited
availability
make
me
want
to
go
after
some
more
of
their
other
beers
instead
i
was
way
stoked
to
find
this
in
my
remote
town
of
800
in
se
alaska
but
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
this
certainly
wasnt
it
i
didnt
know
until
i
went
to
write
this
review
that
it
was
labeled
an
american
porter
im
not
exactly
sure
what
category
i
would
place
it
in
but
not
that
one
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
as
i
nursed
the
sample
but
wasnt
thrilled
upon
first
sip
i
think
the
most
defining
feature
of
this
is
the
moderate
but
undeniable
tart
sourness
character
that
has
me
thinking
farmhouse
odd
pour
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
flat
with
only
some
big
soap
bubbles
at
first
after
the
pour
the
beer
started
cascading
like
guinness
and
did
have
a
very
fine
creamy
small
tan
head
with
no
lace
maybe
an
error
in
bottle
conditoning
if
they
did
that
color
is
an
opaque
brownish
black
with
red
highlights
aroma
is
excellent
with
roast
malt
cocoa
coffee
pine
fruit
eucalyptus
flavor
doesnt
have
quite
so
much
going
on
but
similar
and
still
very
good
body
isnt
bad
but
the
flatness
doesnt
help
finish
is
like
flavor
sure
want
to
try
another
thats
properly
carbonated
drinkability
ok
taste
is
of
dark
fruit
cocoa
spice
a
little
pepper
some
smoke
malt
and
a
few
hops
ends
somewhat
dry
this
is
either
something
other
than
an
american
porter
or
it
is
a
bad
bottle
pour
was
a
nice
dark
brown
massive
tan
head
up
front
a
wine
going
on
vinegar
lactic
sourness
follwed
by
some
raisin
and
prune
dark
fruit
flavors
finish
was
dry
kind
of
hard
to
get
a
handle
on
blindfolded
i
would
have
guessed
a
flanders
oud
bruin
or
some
other
aged
belgian
sour
style
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
holiday
ale
went
well
on
a
cool
late
march
evening
accompanied
by
some
smoked
gruyere
and
wheat
crackers
d
drinkability
was
decent
yeasty
slightly
sour
though
a
bomber
is
plenty
for
me
at
any
given
setting
good
for
a
serving
but
comes
off
rather
expensive
7
this
is
interesting
i
would
not
call
this
a
porter
though
this
does
have
a
few
years
of
age
i
have
not
had
this
fresh
so
it
is
hard
to
say
still
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
anchors
our
special
ale
in
that
vain
this
is
something
that
is
very
enjoyable
recommended
the
folks
at
maxs
assured
me
that
this
was
indeed
what
i
was
drinking
which
has
me
wondering
if
they
might
have
tweaked
the
recipe
my
review
of
this
beer
on
tap
is
nothing
like
what
i
recall
from
the
bottle
version
i
had
some
time
back
pours
a
three
finger
beige
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
black
color
no
highlights
roasted
chocolate
nose
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
roasted
chocolate
and
molasses
pricey
but
worth
trying
at
10
00
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
d
a
decent
beer
for
the
winter
season
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
for
9
id
rather
get
a
good
sixer
or
a
nice
750ml
d
second
best
beer
of
new
years
eve
2009
this
one
is
worth
looking
for
d
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
what
it
was
a
couple
years
old
sat
on
store
shelf
but
still
well
before
the
best
by
date
id
be
wary
of
getting
this
one
again
and
if
i
did
it
would
be
the
freshest
bottle
i
can
find
it
seemed
like
it
would
be
a
good
beer
without
the
oxidation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
the
watery
feel
of
this
brew
makes
it
just
soso
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
which
keeps
you
interested
for
the
entire
bottle
worth
trying
this
one
out
d
very
respectable
choice
to
drink
by
the
fire
on
a
winter
evening
excellent
warming
character
to
this
beer
not
a
beer
to
drink
several
of
in
a
setting
better
suited
to
slowly
savoringcontemplating
could
have
gone
for
a
second
perhaps
d
based
on
the
apperance
and
the
readily
apparent
lack
of
carbonation
i
was
expecting
the
worst
form
this
beer
i
was
decidedly
wrong
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
a
well
balanced
collection
of
rich
velvety
chocolate
and
spice
character
but
it
only
begins
to
hint
at
the
flavor
the
beginning
is
relatively
light
and
slightly
acidic
with
just
some
minor
caramel
flavors
but
it
comes
to
life
in
the
finish
with
a
wonderful
depth
of
flavor
there
is
a
dark
bittersweet
and
earthy
cocoa
flavor
that
compares
in
richness
and
intensity
to
only
a
few
other
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
it
speaks
volumes
about
this
brewery
that
they
have
created
a
beer
that
is
able
at
this
relatively
modest
level
of
alcohol
to
display
flavors
that
i
have
only
ever
seen
in
over
the
top
extreme
imperial
stouts
whats
more
these
flavors
take
on
a
different
sort
of
clarity
and
depth
because
of
the
light
body
and
relative
simplicity
of
this
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
quite
an
unusual
achievement
or
it
would
be
for
almost
any
other
brewery
but
i
have
come
to
expect
nothing
less
than
excellence
from
haandbryggeriet
holiday
ale
or
not
this
one
is
a
decent
beer
pours
near
opaque
black
perhaps
very
dark
brown
with
light
tan
head
that
is
rather
thick
nose
has
a
chocolatewhoppers
candy
sweetness
to
it
on
the
palate
theres
more
dark
chocolate
coffee
goodness
with
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
so
its
not
overly
sweet
rather
easy
drinking
for
the
style
certainly
brewed
with
the
holiday
spirit
in
mind
not
sure
what
it
might
pair
with
food
wise
maybe
some
chocolate
covered
pretzels
light
to
medium
body
feels
a
little
thin
this
one
has
its
moments
but
the
taste
is
just
too
strange
for
me
to
want
more
not
really
sure
what
makes
this
a
christmas
beer
and
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
it
interesting
to
try
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
dark
malts
sour
very
low
carbonation
nissefar
is
probably
not
a
beer
that
will
make
everyones
christmas
wishlist
but
i
think
its
great
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
coffee
black
with
a
very
small
mocha
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
in
the
fruity
stoutporter
malt
range
with
some
vanilla
oak
and
faint
souring
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
sour
with
a
soft
hop
bite
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
like
drinking
a
beer
precarbonation
nissefar
is
a
different
and
enjoyable
experience
if
you
dont
mind
some
sour
in
your
flat
porter
enjoyed
this
beer
but
not
for
the
expected
reasons
will
search
elsewhere
for
true
winter
ale
satisfaction
starts
to
come
to
its
own
as
it
warms
matures
as
a
winter
warmer
but
finishes
like
a
spiced
ale
or
smoked
lambic
an
aggressive
pour
yields
negligible
collar
and
spotty
lacing
patterns
from
this
dark
brown
beverage
the
smell
from
the
bottle
neck
was
chocolaty
but
from
the
pour
a
highly
roasted
malt
and
coffee
aroma
the
mouth
is
bright
and
tangy
from
a
sour
character
the
first
bit
of
taste
flags
the
burnt
and
smokey
flavor
that
becomes
monolithic
its
equally
as
tart
as
the
feel
not
my
favorite
500ml
bottle
from
808
pours
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
strong
chocolaty
dark
malt
on
the
nose
along
with
some
dark
fruit
slightly
tangy
dark
roasty
taste
again
with
plenty
of
cocoa
slight
sourness
that
works
really
well
here
surprisingly
dry
finish
medium
creamy
body
really
pleasantdrinking
if
unconventional
porter
overall
interesting
as
always
i
love
haand
this
may
bot
be
as
good
as
the
flemish
sour
but
still
worth
a
a
try
especially
at
half
off
like
i
got
it
for
nissefar
father
christmas
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
handful
of
haandbryggeriet
beers
that
ive
had
so
far
sour
is
desirable
in
some
styles
but
it
doesnt
work
at
all
in
this
one
bottom
line
barely
better
than
a
lump
of
coal
as
a
stocking
stuffer
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
mediumfull
body
dry
its
a
bit
past
the
holidays
but
still
a
damn
fine
beer
so
drinkable
drinks
well
theres
a
little
warmth
in
the
finish
but
its
pretty
smooth
definitely
has
a
different
character
than
most
american
porters
and
i
really
dig
the
risks
they
took
in
creating
the
unique
flavor
profile
probably
the
fruitiest
porter
ive
had
yet
great
balance
though
and
a
real
treat
seek
this
one
out
its
underrated
drinkability
lovely
to
quaff
but
a
bit
expensive
to
drink
a
lot
of
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
some
sediment
in
the
bottom
and
absolutely
no
head
and
almost
no
carbonation
smells
strongly
of
european
licorice
bitter
chocolate
and
deeply
roasted
grain
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
interesting
the
taste
is
quite
deep
and
rich
for
an
american
porter
less
licorice
here
but
it
is
still
quite
noticeable
there
is
a
a
fai
bit
of
malty
sweetness
and
some
herbal
bitterness
and
molasses
still
the
overall
effect
is
dry
not
overly
sweet
rich
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
lacks
carbonation
and
is
the
tiniest
bit
sticky
as
well
a
little
thick
to
drink
too
much
of
still
quite
interesting
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
rocky
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
black
patent
and
chocolate
malt
scent
thats
dry
and
earthy
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
yet
almost
soda
like
feel
its
thick
with
loads
of
malt
complexity
there
is
a
weird
tangy
bitterness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
just
above
average
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
i
just
cant
get
over
the
thick
almost
flat
beer
aspect
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
malt
bill
seems
right
on
and
the
appearance
rocks
but
the
mouthfeel
really
ruins
it
for
me
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
batch
169
brewed
aug
08
and
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
poured
jet
black
with
a
few
cola
colored
highlights
near
the
edges
and
a
thin
head
of
bubbly
tan
foam
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malts
bakers
chocolate
and
some
slightly
vinous
dark
fruits
the
flavor
included
charred
malts
chocolate
covered
cherries
plums
and
a
hint
of
underlying
toffee
a
nice
mellow
roastiness
lingers
but
is
not
bitter
or
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
and
slickoily
light
carbonation
an
interesting
christmas
brew
the
flavor
is
a
bit
vinous
and
full
of
dark
fruit
but
it
is
also
rich
and
malty
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
its
one
of
those
beers
you
keep
in
your
hand
until
its
finished
which
is
undoubtedly
fairly
quickly
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
another
bottle
this
isnt
even
i
style
im
that
fond
of
but
this
is
a
must
try
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
toasty
with
fruit
hops
and
coffee
it
reminds
me
of
a
porter
three
is
also
a
hint
of
soap
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
smooth
tan
head
that
is
very
persistent
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thick
overall
a
nice
beer
i
just
dont
like
the
acidic
finish
smooth
full
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
although
the
flavors
are
well
enough
restrained
that
the
bubbles
arent
missed
im
impressed
with
this
take
on
the
porter
even
if
its
not
exactly
what
an
american
porter
is
normally
like
poured
like
rusty
stagnant
black
rain
water
from
an
old
pipe
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
even
after
a
rather
assertive
pour
in
hopes
of
getting
some
kind
of
foamy
cap
nothing
immediately
i
think
something
is
amiss
and
suspect
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
until
i
read
that
many
other
people
have
said
the
same
thing
oh
well
moving
along
the
smell
is
terrific
which
really
surprised
me
after
that
truly
lackluster
performance
in
the
pour
very
malty
with
loads
of
sweet
toasted
grains
toffee
and
perhaps
a
pinch
of
spent
coffee
grounds
all
of
these
are
reflected
in
the
flavour
but
not
with
the
intensity
one
gets
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
holiday
beer
boasting
7
as
far
as
weight
however
there
is
zero
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
rather
strange
why
would
a
norwegian
brewey
choose
to
replicate
an
american
porter
for
their
christmas
offering
how
can
their
other
offerings
be
so
well
crafted
yet
this
pours
into
your
pint
glass
like
cold
coffee
with
a
little
bit
of
black
mushroom
soil
dissolved
into
it
oh
well
im
still
glad
i
got
o
try
this
one
and
it
isnt
terrible
it
just
looks
odd
when
you
pour
it
these
guys
can
do
much
much
better
though
how
does
a
norwegian
christmas
beer
qualify
as
an
american
porter
huh
well
this
pours
black
into
a
duvel
tulip

with
a
mild

that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
low
carbonation
sort
of
a
smooth
lactic
feel
kind
of
average
yet
well
crafted
for
the
money
id
much
rather
have
a
sixer
of
anchor
osa
d
this
goes
down
way
too
easy
seemed
more
like
a
baltic
porter
to
me
but
very
nice
and
complex
d
i
couldnt
put
down
the
glass
every
sip
brings
on
a
new
subtle
nuance
this
brewery
seems
to
have
the
midas
touch
with
everything
ive
tried
from
them
so
far
im
dying
to
find
more
of
their
bottled
offerings
something
to
enjoy
after
your
christmasguests
have
left
very
good

anyway
this
is
a
very
fine
effort
from

not
a

for
the

scandinavian
christmas
dinner
but
try
it
if
you
have

or
simply
enjoy
it
on

of
a
fantastic
old
ale
overall
this
is
quite
the
nice
old
ale
it
feels
rustic
and
warming
in
all
respects
as
the
style
should
feel
a
maltforward
aroma
and
flavor
are
aided
by
warming
alcohol
and
a
thick
feel

make

a

with
nice

nice

rich
in
sweet

raisins
and

almonds
the

really
developed
with

good

a
great

pretty
frickin
awesome
yep
pretty
frickin
awesome
very
good
beer
especially
for
the
winter
time
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
love
the
strong
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
beautifully
balanced
with
toffee
and
spice
ill
definitely
get
this
again
next
christmas
one
of
the
best
fallwinter
ales
out
there
great
divide
makes
many
great
beers
but
this
is
tops
great
color
and
very
smooth
you
want
to
take
your
time
drinking
experience
worth
it
overall
iv
had
multiple
old
ales
and
this
doesnt
taste
like
one
it
has
a
strange
toffeechocolatecoffee
character
that
to
me
is
more
like
a
black
ale
or
imperial
porter
of
sorts
i
dont
get
that
molasses
taste
i
love
in
old
ales
except
for
the
slightest
bit
in
the
finish
its
different
and
fairly
tasty
ill
give
it
that
but
as
a
old
ale
it
misses
the
mark
this
is
one
of
those
beers
on
here
that
i
feel
is
overrated
a
most
impressive
winter
ale
massive
in
flavor
and
aroma
and
with
a
most
pleasingly
soft
and
warm
impression
on
the
palate
a
must
try
something
on
the
nose
and
in
the
back
of
the
palate
about
this
one
an
over
toasted
nuttiness
burnt
sugar
thing
that
didnt
sit
well
with
me
otherwise
a
really
nice
beer
but
something
in
the
darker
malts
just
wasnt
in
harmony
for
me
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
full
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
quickly
nice
lingering
lacing
pours
a
mahogany
brown
amber
red
smells
slightly
like
malts
hops
spices
like
cloves
maybe
but
only
slight
and
little
else
thick
in
the
mouth
like
a
good
winter
warmer
or
old
english
ale
should
be
tastes
are
malt
hops
something
like
tea
sugar
and
spice
little
bitter
aftertaste
but
very
subtle
really
tasty
as
it
gets
to
room
temperature
cant
place
the
fruit
notes
i
dont
taste
any
espresso
like
some
reviewers
tea
and
maybe
apricots
its
good
hides
the
abv
well
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
watching
the
football
this
beer
is
fun
and
drinkable
it
has
a
short
1
finger
head
but
lingering
lace
the
nose
is
caramel
and
vanilla
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
spice
the
flavor
is
sweet
on
the
start
and
underscores
the
nose
with
a
bitter
finish
that
draws
out
some
espresso
notes
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
i
like
it
for
a
winter
ale
and
will
look
for
more
malty
front
with
a
small
hop
bite
in
back
tea
cocoa
dried
grass
straw
drying
finish
very
nice
this
is
a
good
strong
winter
warmer
highalcohol
and
spicy
for
those
cold
snowy
days
another
solid
offering
from
great
divide
who
does
big
beers
like
this
very
well
o
despite
the
16
months
of
aging
of
this
seasonal
beerit
held
up
really
well
i
remember
having
this
in
december
2013
and
it
was
good
then
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
hidden
a
bit
better
but
it
was
still
good
now
if
i
see
this
next
year
i
will
gladly
buy
more
this
is
the
first
great
divide
brew
ive
come
across
that
i
havent
truly
enjoyed
i
cant
explain
it
but
it
had
an
odd
taste
to
me
something
i
still
cant
put
my
finger
on
even
the
next
day
perhaps
just
me
at
a
bad
time
or
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
i
was
surprised
that
it
tasted
the
way
it
did
because
i
did
not
feel
that
it
was
a
english
style
old
ale
i
might
try
it
again
in
the
future
just
to
be
sure
tasty
winter
warmer
very
little
spice
if
at
all
confused
by
the
high
rating
o
no
idea
what
is
wrong
here
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
darn
good
beer
im
getting
mediocre
to
bad
m
medium
body
med
carbonation
creamy
warming
and
slightly
hot
alcohol
makes
it
a
sipper
pleasantly
complex
with
a
bitter
end
cleaning
off
the
maltiness
slightly
too
bitter
slightly
too
warming
better
with
hearty
food
nothing
amazing
but
a
nice
winter
warmer
for
a
cold
day
side
note
poured
from
bottle
bought
in
oklahoma
city
ok
i
would
definitely
buy
this
treat
again
fun
winter
brew
nice
malty
smell
ok
taste
finishaftertaste
was
unpleasant
to
me
aftertaste
was
almost
like
milk
mixed
with
beer
not
a
good
combination
smell
and
taste
do
not
match
smell
is
balanced
between
caramelized
malt
and
herby
hops
taste
has
too
many
things
going
on
in
it
that
are
not
complimentary
the
herb
profile
does
not
mesh
well
with
the
coffeechocolate
note
base
not
my
favorite
beer
from
this
solid
brewing
company
toffee
molasses
thick
malt
overwhelms
hop
character
a
toffee
coffee
mess
of
a
beer
i
cringed
with
every
sip
absolutely
disgusting
drank
at
a
reputed
bar
in
nyc
so
i
dont
believe
it
was
the
tap
lines
o
4i
picked
this
one
up
on
a
lark
and
im
a
big
fan
of
great
divide
its
probably
not
in
my
top
favorites
of
theirs
but
its
a
nice
beer
id
drink
again
for
sure
but
maybe
not
a
must
have
in
my
cellar
very
good
beer
sweet
molasses
on
the
taste
smell
is
not
as
good
something
odd
on
the
nose
but
not
present
when
tasting
the
beer
looks
dark
brown
very
little
if
any
light
shining
through
smell
initially
grains
bread
batter
after
the
pour
later
i
only
get
floral
herbaceous
hops
with
minimal
malt
or
grain
taste
sad
to
say
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
dont
like
ale
with
this
flavor
profile
it
reminds
me
of
a
doppelbock
gone
wrong
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
herbal
hops
might
be
the
strong
alcohol
note
this
would
be
good
with
a
meal
just
not
my
preference
for
a
sipping
beer
ymmv
mouth
feel
very
full
almost
syrupy
overall
if
you
like
old
english
ales
with
a
darker
roast
malt
and
herbal
hop
and
high
abv
this
could
be
for
you
for
me
it
is
better
to
look
else
where
samuel
smith
for
example
overall
another
very
nice
beer
from
great
divide
they
consistently
make
fine
beer
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
cold
weather
really
warming
and
inviting
but
also
a
little
complex

ales
body
is
thick
chewy
and
robust
and
has
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
with
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
bitter
set
of
preserved
black

come
to
the

finishes
dry
with
a
slight

light
bit
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
o
with
the
first
few
sips
i
was
unimpressed
with
what
seemed
to
be
an
unbalanced
beer
that
opinion
changed
upwards
in
correlation
with
the
temperature
would
repeat
and
at
cellar
temperatures
overall
this
would
make
a
great
winter
warmer
try
it
overall
beautiful
rich
flavors
stradles
the
line
of
several
styles
thick
rich
sweet
malts
pair
wonderfully
with
peaty
smoked
malts
combines
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
everything
comes
together
wonderfully
nice
warming
quality
to
this
beer
decadent
and
filling
this
is
a
great
old
ale
that
fits
perfectly
at
christmas
and
you
should
celebrate
christmas
all
year
round
overall
its
a
great
beer
plain
and
simple
it
has
a
lot
of
rich
flavors
but
they
are
removed
from
the
palate
once
the
sip
is
done
which
leaves
you
ready
to
have
another
sip
immediately
i
recommend
grabbing
it
and
giving
it
a
shot
if
youre
a
fan
of
higher
alcohol
stouts
and
porters
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
lot
of
other
old
ales
that
ive
had
but
its
good
in
its
own
right
glass
snifter
dark
brown
color
smells
like
a
brown
ale
fantastic
beer
that
taste
like
a
toasty
malty
brown
ale
some
mollasis
great
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
fantastic
old
ale
that
i
think
taste
like
a
brown
ale
o
ill
need
to
get
used
to
the
style
before
i
can
enjoy
this
one
definitely
has
promising
notes
and
overall
a
perfect
candidate
for
the
style
but
my
personal
aesthetic
score
would
be
noticeably
lower
overall
a
very
pleasant
ale
unique
in
flavor
and
really
hides
the
strength
well
overall
good
beer
malty
dry
flavor
the
warmth
would
be
great
for
a
cold
night
has
that
warming
effect
on
the
body
very
drinkable
for
an
8
7
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
fresher
overall
fresh
this
one
is
good
but
id
say
it
ages
very
nicely
good
age
sets
in
in
the
first
year
well
worth
stocking
the
cellar
here
o
great
big
beer
well
balanced
dark
beer
big

and

an
old
ale

ages
beautifully
after
about
15
months
in
the
cellar
the
flavors
of
toffee
caramel
fig
molasses
and
bittersweet
chocolate
meld
even
more
seamlessly
with
a
silky
smooth
feel
will
definitely
be
putting
some
more
of
this
away
to
hibernate

a

a

lots
of

thin
in

o
pretty
typical
of
an

smells
a

odd

it
tastes

may
be
most
dominant
but
really
a
well
rounded
beer
body
is
medium
large
plenty
of
carbonation
not
really
dry
and
man
it
is
going
down
much
to
fast
this
is
my
3rd
bottle
of
this
and
it
is
simply
a
great
beer
give
this
one
a
try
it
does
not
disappoint
poured
a
dark
red
with
a
light
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
with
little
lacing
smells
of
dark
chocolate
dates
and
burnt
espresso
tastes
like
spicy
chocolate
coffee
dark
fruit
its
slightly
musty
like
an
old
shoe
in
a
good
way
and
there
is
a
touch
of
dirt
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
spicy
and
burnt
a
bit
dry
over
all
a
very
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
will
warm
one
well
in
the
winter
months
highly
recommended
o
an
interesting
winter
warmer
well
done
o
a
great
winter
ale
for
sure
lots
of
big
bold
flavor
kinda
like
an
imperial
brown
ale
with
more
complexity
definitely
worth
having
ogreat
winter
beer
to
look
forward
to
every
year
drinkability
a
best
winter
warmer
might
age
well
too
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
the
old
ale
style
but
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
beer
the
hops
jump
out
of
this
more
than
i
expect
with
some
nice
classic
roasty
undertones
i
think
i
probably
drank
most
of
this
a
little
too
cold
as
it
warmed
things
smoothed
out
and
the
hops
werent
as
overpowering
definitely
let
it
sit
a
little
bit
oreally
nice
beer
would
like
to
grab
another
bottle
and
see
how
it
ages
o
really
nice
ale
perfect
winter
warmer
ill
definitely
buy
more
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
lets
this
one
prick
your
tongue
with
beery
goodness
very
nice
beer
over
all
but
its
not
some
perfect
style
its
just
about
right
for
a
winter
beer
or
old
ale
i
prefer
this
over
sam
adams
winter
lager
sierra
nevada
celebration
or
widmer
brrr
overall
a
better
than
average
beer
this
was
a
unique
beer
for
me
primarily
tasting
like
coffee
im
assuming
from
the
malts
i
love
drinking
coffee
the
only
problem
is
that
it
tastes
like
cheap
coffee
therefore
kind
of
leading
to
a
cheap
taste
the
mouth
feel
was
the
let
down
on
this
beer
for
me
just
felt
too
thin
almost
watery
at
times
o
a
rich
and
robust
old
ale
full
of
great
and
complex
malt
flavors
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
leading
to
a
mostly
smooth
45
and
slightly
foamy
15
mouthfeel
that
feels
a
bit
wrong
for
the
style
and
flavors
more
foaminess
and
thickness
would
be
appropriate
ethanol
is
wellmasked
by
the
malt
with
little
hint
of
it
being
noticeable
on
the
palate
and
in
nostrils
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
overall
great
beer
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
overall
the
beer
is
quite
earthy
and
i
like
it
overall
a
tasty
complex
beer
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
see
in
it
my
first
old
ale
and
i
quite
like
it
seems
to
me
like
an
imperial
brown
ale
similar
flavors
but
packs
a
punch
absolutely
in
love
with
this
its
so
interesting
so
robust
so
complex
prost
o
i
cant
remember
trying
a
beer
with
such
a
pleasant
after
taste
that
really
sticks
around
this
is
a
really
good
seasonal
from
great
divide
bought
a
six
pack
at
table
and
vine
beautiful
dark
cloud
amber
brown
appearance
with
some
patchy
lacing
on
the
side
the
aromas
were
very
powerful
to
my
nose
a
very
powerful
roasty
malt
smell
mixed
with
dry
fruit
smells
like
raisins
caramel
and
bread
taste
got
better
as
i
drank
the
beer
over
the
evening
a
very
sweet
sugary
flavor
very
hard
to
describe
definitely
some
alcohol
mixed
with
chocolate
cinnamon
grapes
caramel
mouthfeel
was
excellent
for
this
drink
good
balance
of
carbonation
mixed
with
a
silky
cream
body
overall
man
this
was
a
great
holiday
drink
for
the
winters
overall
a
tasty
and
powerful
beer
drink
with
caution
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
dark
ruby
hue
nice
head
of
tan
foam
that
laces
well
and
has
reasonable
retention
light
nose
of
dark
malt
molasses
and
piney
hops
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
the
taste
is
complex
and
has
dark
malt
heavy
on
the
chocolate
molasses
and
a
hop
undertone
sweetness
is
present
but
is
almost
hidden
by
roast
malt
bitterness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
on
the
finish
a
nice
oak
flavor
comes
through
and
lingers
along
with
a
light
hop
flavor
very
good
but
not
outstanding
sweeter
side
not
a
problem
with
me
if
you
like
roasted
malt
forward
ales
this
one
is
for
you
this
brew
is
recommended
almost
9
abv
and
no
mention
of
alcohol
drinks
easy
and
good
appearance
is
a
murky
nutbrown
cloudy
and
dark
with
reddish

hues
around
the
edges
nose

roasted

unsweetened
cocoa

mediumthick
bodied
and
medium

appropriate
for
style
tasty
and
complex
o
an
ideal
beer
for
the
winter
fullbodied
heavy
and
the
dark
fruit
flavors
are
perfect
for
a
cold
night
overall
overall
for
the
most
part
it
was
a
very
nice
drinking
old
ale
with
an
amazing
aroma
and
a
good
set
of
sweet
and
malty
flavors
a
little
less
bitterness
may
have
suited
the
style
and
my
preferences
a
bit
more
but
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
o
very
interesting
combination
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
by
a
campfire
on
a
cold
night
or
curling
up
on
the
couch
during
a
snow
storm
it
definitely
a
nice
winter
brew
o
3
75
not
that
great
for
an
old
ale
missing
that
certain
aged
bourbon
and
vanilla
characteristic
i
would
want
at
8
7
abv
its
pretty
strong
but
it
was
bottled
on
aug
30th
this
year
ill
try
and
find
a
bottle
from
last
year
at
one
of
my
favorite
hole
in
the
wall
bottle
shops
maybe
that
will
be
a
bit
better
pours
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
caramel
with
lots
of
smoke
flavor
of
tobacco
yet
more
smoke
caramel
roasty
finish
balanced
with
some
nice
piney
hops
at
the
end
leaves
a
taste
in
my
mouth
that
reminds
me
of
a
camp
fire
had
lots
of
winter
beers
but
this
one
seems
like
a
notch
or
two
above
all
the
rest
this
was
a
very
interesting
ale
i
was
expecting
a
more
malty
sweet
flavour
but
this
to
me
tastes
like
a
hopy
stout
given
that
this
was
bottled
a
little
under
2
months
ago
the
old
essences
are
rather
astounding
even
if
theyre
a
bit
different
from
those
of
the
progenitors
of
the
style
nutty
and
toasty
this
one
is
and
duly
warming
in
that
dont
know
it
til
it
hits
you
sort
of
way
good
stuff
o
wonderful
ale
to
sip
on
as
temperatures
start
to
drop
for
not
knowing
what
to
expect
the
one
thing
i
did
expect
didnt
let
me
down
great
divide
makes
great
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
and
would
drink
it
again
feel
smooth
medium
body
wth
soft
carbonation
overalllooks
and
smells
great
drops
off
a
little
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
wouldve
liked
the
finish
to
last
longer
nice
and
creamy
light
tan
head
with
a
nice
dark
ruby
with
hints
of
dark
brown
strong
roasted
mt
smell
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
skight
caramel
notes
light
dark
fruit
flavor
dominated
by
caramel
toffee
and
roasted
malt
notrs
silky
feel
with
very
little
carbonation
heavy
bodied
but
feels
light
as
well
worth
every
penny
overall
i
love
great
divide
and
this
offering
did
not
dissapoint
if
your
into
old
ales
or
malty
beers
than
give
this
a
go
otherwise
unassuming
blue
and
cream
label
depicting
a
cross
country
skiing
figure
boasts
a
few
awards
on
the
side
poured
into
a
goblet
dark
redtinged
brown
tan
head
and
i
can
smell
toffee
on
the
nose
from
about
two
feet
away
close
up
its
an
herby
roasted
grain
aroma
smells
like
its
gonna
be
sweet
first
sip
has
my
throat
tightening
a
bit
from
the
alcohol
this
almost
has
a
winelike
character
to
it
and
not
far
behind
at
almost
nine
percent
plummy
earthy
and
stoutish
mouthfeel
is
definitely
thick
creamy
and
barely
carbonated
stylistically
appropriate
hot
and
heavy
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
this
beer
seemed
to
lack
a
little
something
a
little
more
carbonation
sweetnessfruitiness
spice
a
bit
dry
and
almost
flat
tasting
almost
metallic
i
guess
the
funkiness
of
an
old
ale
seemed
to
come
through
i
love
great
divide
but
this
was
not
quite
up
to
their
usual
standard
imo
the
booze
was
not
at
all
prevalent
and
maybe
that
would
have
helped
more
ill
give
this
a
try
again
especially
since
its
now
easily
available
but
next
time
i
might
age
a
while
to
see
what
that
does
maybe
i
was
just
in
a
weird
mood
o
real
nice
old
ale
with
a
great
hearty
grounded
character
drinks
like
a
classic
overall
perhaps
a
touch
sweet
but
really
good
nonetheless
i
would
love
to
have
this
stuff
available
to
me
locally
id
put
a
bunch
away
in
my
cellar
o
a
good
beer
to
curl
up
with
on
a
cold
night
an
enjoyable
sipper
to
get
you
the
winter
season
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
and
based
on
my
reading
up
on
the
style
it
seems
to
be
well
designed
for
the
category
it
was
malty
and
tasty
hid
the
abv
well
and
went
down
smooth
considering
it
was
brewed
to
pack
a
wallop
this
bottle
was
well
aged
and
mellow
and
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
as
it
was
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
decent
malty
brew
im
glad
i
got
it
in
my
variety
pack
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
medium
bodied
drying
doesnt
coat
the
tongue
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
lots
of
flavor
to
compliment
the
high
8
7
alcohol
this
is
fantastic
im
sure
it
can
be
bear
but
it
would
take
effort
a
nice
sweet
rich
old
ale
something
to
look
forward
to
every
winter
very
fine
quite
nice
crazy
malty
all
over
this
thing
on
the
nose
and
the
profile
not
sure
if
aging
would
help
tone
this
down
but
it
couldnt
hurt
id
imagine
very
smooth
feel
alcohol
hidden
fairly
well
nice
drinker
but
id
tone
down
the
malt
sweetness
if
it
were
up
to
me
its
definitely
a
winter
beer
fairly
complex
brew
still
a
bit
hot
but
rich
malt
profile
and
nice
dark
fruit
accents
cheers
ogood
beer
one
of
my
favorite
old
style
english
brown
ales
o
im
more
of
a
fan
of
the
leathery
highly
malted
old
ales
this
was
one
was
just
a
tad
light
more
for
me
it
still
had
nice
flavors
and
was
pretty
drinkable
overallcomments
this
was
my
first
time
having
this
and
it
came
highly
recommended
very
good
and
complex
brew
that
i
could
see
being
perfect
for
a
cold
winters
night
classified
as
an
old
ale
at
8
7
abv
consumed
11813
almost
too
easy
to
drink
considering
the
size
nice
complex
flavors
and
pleasing
as
all
get
out
i
had
this
last
night
at
my
local
watering
holepints
what
a
beer
the
local
distributor
had
been
sitting
on
a
keg
of
last
years
so
this
was
a
2011
vintage
at
first
pour
the
beer
was
cloudy
similar
to
an
unfiltered
cider
with
shades
of
hazy
brown
slight
head
with
a
great
amount
of
lacing
i
could
smell
notes
of
vanilla
the
mouth
feel
was
very
smooth
and
subdued
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
there
was
a
subtle
hop
flavor
but
none
of
the
bitterness
remained
definite
notes
of
brown
sugar
hit
my
palate
in
a
big
way
with
some
roasted
malt
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavor
intensified
and
the
haze
cleared
a
bitrevealing
a
shade
similar
to
clear
amber
this
is
how
winter
beer
should
be
i
could
drink
this
beer
year
round
but
especially
in
the
winter
this
was
a
really
delicious
beer
it
had
a
nice
maltiness
to
it
with
just
enough
hop
character
to
round
it
out
the
alcohol
for
the
most
part
was
well
hidden
this
would
make
for
a
very
nice
beer
on
a
cold
winter
day
this
beer
is
just
full
of
flavor
and
thats
what
i
am
all
about
i
go
back
to
this
beer
time
and
time
again
and
im
always
amazed
at
just
how
much
complexity
they
get
into
it
its
got
a
big
taste
and
a
pretty
decent
gravity
to
boot
a
sure
winner
in
my
book
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
go
get
some
if
youre
someone
who
appreciates
a
big
malty
ale
youre
sure
to
love
it
definitely
a
lot
of
bang
for
your
buck
for
this
beer
its
a
pretty
big
brew
and
only
goes
for
about
11
for
a
sixer
i
might
be
buying
this
one
again
soon
and
possibly
age
one
or
two
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
balance
each
other
nicely
and
the
body
is
heavy
but
without
becoming
syrupy
o
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
a
very
good
malt
driven
ale
complex
toasty
flavors
with
a
nice
warming
feel
o
pretty
good
winter
brew
a
little
bit
bitter
for
my
tastes
but
good
craftsmanship
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
winter
offering
from
great
divide
they
make
a
lot
of
great
beers
and
this
for
their
12
ounce
seasonal
offering
is
one
of
the
best
the
label
has
also
changed
over
the
years
i
remember
when
the
label
used
to
be
red
now
the
label
is
blue
who
cares
what
color
the
label
is
i
am
focused
on
the
flavor
of
the
beer
bottoms
up
people
a
solid
winter
ale
oa
decent
winter
ale
not
spice
heavy
but
the
malt
character
was
good
and
balanced
a
nice
seasonal
beer
for
a
cold
colorado
night
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
a
definite
sipping
beer
i
loved
the
complexity
and
balance
in
this
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
not
very
noticeable

for

this

drinks
pretty
easilt
at
this
abv
a
great
holiday
beer
perfect
for
a
dark
dreary
day
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
still
but
light
and
not
sticky
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
from
the
complex
hops
malts
and
dark
fruit
flavor
i
really
like
this
winter
ale
from
great
divide
and
look
forward
to
it
every
year
when
i
can
get
it
pours
a
deep
copperbrown
with
a
frothy
beige

better
than
i
remembered
it
being
nice
malty

complemented
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
overall
the
age
did
this
one
well
its
easy
to
drink
really
enjoyable
and
heavily
mellowed
i
could
see
buying
another
six
pack
this
year
and
aging
a
few
more
pours

just
a
hint
of
smoke
i
could
see
having
this
sitting
next
to
a
fire
on
a
cold
day
after
my
first
old
ale
style
experience
i
think
it
was
a
bad
bottle
this
one
will
make
me
seek
out
a
few
more
of
the
style
a
winter
gem
here
toasty
malted
taste
yet
really
fresh
high
abv
but
doesnt
bog
me
down
keep
going
back
for
more
warming
smooth
and
imo
perfect
finish
notes
of
dark
bread
coffee
chocolate
raisin
hadnt
heard
anything
about
it
just
picked
up
a
sixer
because
i
had
denver
on
my
mind
so
glad
i
did
probably
my
nightcapper
until
red
chair
comes
out
it
will
be
hard
to
see
this
one
go
o
great
beer
and
one
ill
try
again
but
not
necessarily
an
alltime
fave
i
let
it
rest
a
few
minutes
after
taking
it
out
of
the
fridge
before
pouring
to
give
it
a
real
english
ale
feel
and
the
flavors
came
out
more
of
a
tasting
beer
i
did
not
try
it
with
the
labels
suggestions
of
romano
an
aged
hard
dutch
cows
milk
cheese
grilled
beef
tenderloin
apple
crisp
with
ginger
ice
cream
but
i
could
see
how
the
tartness
and
smoothness
of
the
beer
would
enhance
strongflavored
food
i
think
the
malty
sweetness
would
go
well
with
some
shoofly
pie
and
some
lebanon
bologna
id
like
to
see
how
the
flavors
reduce
as
an
ingredient
or
if
used
to
deglaze
a
pan

overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
aroma
this
was
nicely
earthy
and
very
gritty
adding
a
sense
of
mystery
right
off
the
first
whiff
it
added
warmth
sweetness
and
a
coolness
of
nutts
in
all
of
its
inclusive
glory
the
flavoring
was
equally
as
interesting
with
a
stark
bitterness
and
strong
musty
quality
throughout
this
beer
truly
feels
like
an
old
ale
through
and
through
and
has
enough
surprises
around
each
aspect
of
the
beer
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
o
pretty
big
flavors
going
on
reminds
me
of
brown
sugar
would
have
thought
the
abv
was
higher
from
both
flavor
and
warmth
real
tasty
brew
though
a
bit
expensive
but
wonderful
as
a
post
meal
sipper
o
overall
a
great
old
ale
easy
drinking
but
packing
full
of
flavor
and
complexity
this
is
a
tasty
beer
a
winter
warmer
that
isnt
5
spices
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
six
pack
highly
recommend
for
those
cold
winter
days
its
a

but
i
rounded
this
one
down
just
a
notch

enjoyed
this

more
than
i
was

this
beer
for
me
i
will
seek
this
one

not
be
shy
in
sticking
a

this
is
a

that
is
a

sipper
and
a
good
beer
to
look
up
on
a
chilly
day
anywhere
in

country
overall
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
its
a
great

and
the
price
is
easy

overall
a
beer
i
always
look

i
dont
know
why
but
i
loved
this
beer
this
was
very
early
in
our
tasting
session
and
the
caramel
maltiness
still
stands
out
it
had
a
great
roasted
malt
profile
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
dark
fruit
just
a
little
bit
dry
on
the
mouthfeel
enough
to
crisp
it
up
a
bit
the
carbonation
on
this
was
spot
on
and
to
be
quite
honest
i
could
have
sipped
this
for
the
rest
of
the
tasting
and
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
medium
brown
color
along
the
lines
of
what
i
expected
tasted
some
roasted
qualities
that
were
very
pleasing
this

seemed
true

certainly
exceeded

i
really
want
to
try
this
beer
in
its
ba
form
overall
a
solid
old
ale
the
chile
aspect
is
strange
to
me
and
none
of
us
can
figure
out
when
it
came
from
oh
well
get
a

d
very
drinkable
nice
old

a
great
big
malty

nice
overall
balance
with
a
good
amount
of
body
to
hold
up
the
strong
flavors
o
this
is
textbook
example
of
an
old
ale
in
my
opinion
i
got
a
couple
more
im
going
to
let
pick
up
some
age
and
i
would
love
to
get
my
greasy
mittens
around
a
barrel
aged
version
originally
reviewed
10292010
overall
a
good
old
ale
but
not
the
best
still
worth
a
try
o
a
great
and
very
uqniue
ale
put
some
aside
as
this
is
a
prime
canadate
for
aging
o
this
is
an
okay
winter
ale
that
could
have
been
brought
together
and
presented
better
o
very
pleasant
warming
rustic
a
good
beer
to
hibernate
with
or
just
sit
on
the
back
porch
must
have
again
recommended
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
certainly
not
too
much
so
while
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
i
had
no
problem
getting
through
a
full
pint
of
it
and
would
certainly
order
it
again
a
nice
sweet
old
ale
that
isnt
boozy
worth
checking
out
overall
not
an
impressive
old
ale
not
even
remarkable
its
completely
missing
a
solid
malt
base
to
back
up
the
other
flavors
drinkable
but
not
really
worth
drinking
overall
pretty
solid
if
a
little
imperfect
and
fun
to
drink
if
i
am
in
the
right
mood
id
want
this
beer
again
this
hibernational
ale
is
a
great
winter
ale
this
pours
out
from
the
bottle
into
a
dark
amber
color
its
a
bock
with
a
nutty
taste
this
hearty
ale
has
loads
of
flavor
it
has
a
milky
taste
and
finishes
smooth
slightly
hoppy
would
pair
well
with
a
smoked
cheese
or
chowdah
o
this
is
a
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
alcohol
gives
some
warming
but
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
highly
recommended
this
beer
poured
into
my
great
divide
glass
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
lasted
a
while
and
a
nice
mahogany
color
the
aroma
was
very
pleasant
with
a
bit
of
fruit
coming
through
the
taste
was
a
bit
like
a
scotch
ale
to
me
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
was
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
8
7
abv
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
when
its
could
out
and
the
balanced
malty
roasty
taste
makes
this
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
doesnt
immediately
jump
out
but
it
gradually
reveals
itself
as
the
beer
begins
to
warm
up
o
old
ales
and
barleywines
are
the
only
styles
that
i
have
had
several
times
and
have
never
enjoyed
one
that
i
have
had
usually
they
are
too
sweet
boozy
or
syrupy
this
beer
is
outstanding
though
hits
a
great
balance
of
sweet
and
hoppy
very
drinkable
for
the
style
o
hibernation
is
a
fantastic
old
ale
its
strong
and
tastes
like
it
delicious
and
well
worth
your
time
and
effort
a
great
beer
if
its
a
little
chilly
outside
a
nice
warmer
for
a
cold
night
i
would
have
this
again
o
a
really
solid
example
of
the
style
not
quite
as
heavy
and
brutal
on
the
palate
as
a
barleywine
would
but
a
lot
of
the
same
notes
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
this
is
a
reliable
beer
if
you
dig
dark
fruits
and
juicy
sweetness
of
course
if
your
heater
blows
out
in
january
its
wise
to
have
a
few
of
these
babies
on
hand
malt
assault
could
certainly
taste
dark
fruits
and
hints
of
caramel
on
the
first
sip
not
too
very
hoppy
a
heavy
mixture
of
sweet
malt
maybe
even
syrupy
would
certainly
like
to
have
again
sometime
makes
for
a
great
sipping
beer
not
much
of
a
gulping
brew

o
unfortunately
i
was
a
little
stopped
up
the
day
i
tried
this
that
being
said
i
was
impressed
with
this
ale
and
i
will
try
this
again
as
soon
as
i
can
i
really
enjoyed
the
well
balance
and
smooth
flavors
that
this
ale
had
to
offer
overall
the
beer
is
well
balanced
but
then
again
nothing
particularly
stands
out
as
amazing
from
it
except
for
it
being
the
only
bee
ive
given
a
perfect
appearance
score
to
everything
i
looked
for
was
there
moreys
bottom
line
extremely
drinkable
super
balanced
great
mouthfeel
taste
like
a
cross

an

and

ale
really
nice
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
and
sticky
lacing
it
smells
like
roasted
caramel
malts
and
theres
a
slight
boozyness
to
it
i
it
also
tastes
like
caramel
with
a
roasted
quality
this
beer
has
some
nuttiness
and
tastes
kind
of
like
a
fig
newton
its
got
surprisingly
somewhat
of
a
hoppy
after
taste
mixed
with
some
boozeyness
it
has
a
medium
body
and
leaves
a
stickiness
behind
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
beer
tastes
with
some
age
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy

down

is
of

some
very
mild

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
roasty

that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
old
ale
that
is
very
toasty
roasty
and
malty
a
bit
one
dimensional
in
my
opinion
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
this
one
one
was
bottled
on
october
6th
so
i
wasnt
getting
the
hop
i
may
have
3
months
ago
but
i
think
its
great
the
way
it
is
i
seem
to
like
anything
i
have
tried
in
this
style
a
seasonal
must
try
o
a
great
winter
time
beer
would
love
to
grab
a
sixer
of
this
or
more
and
sip
during
a
cold
winter
night
o
this
was
fabulous
perfect
for
a
cold
night
one
of
my
new
favorite
winter
seasonals
overall
not
terribly
interesting
to
think
about
while
tasting
but
not
at
all
dull
either

rum
and
cream
taste
matches
well
with
a
burnt

and
subtly
bitter
aftertaste
feel
is
smooth
as
can
be
reminds
me
of
a
less
intense
scotch
ale
very
drinkable
and
a
deep
yet
subtle
sweetness
drink
this
one
slow
and
let
it
warm
as
you
go
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
but
overall
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
bit
disappointed
since
it
seems
to
have
some
potential
about
it
maybe
an
older
bottle
would
be
superior
and
ill
remember
to
try
it
at
a
later
date
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
itll
certainly
get
you
warm
at
8
7
it
at
times
tastes
too
medicinal
overall
impression
where
is
the
body
and
strength
im
not
sure
i
could
appreciate
this
one
as
an
old
ale
lacked
quite
a
bit
but
did
have
some
good
qualities
along
the
way
would
like
to
seek
out
in
bottle
form
and
compare
great
divide
hibernation
ale
pouring
the
hibernation
ale
into
a
glass
you
would
think
it
is
a
porter
the
head
is
tan
colored
and
thin
with
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
robust
with
roast
malt
as
the
primary
note
but
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
unlike
the
pitch
black
porters
some
light
does
get
through
its
beer
bottle
brown
with
a
hint
of
ruby
coloration
the
flavor
is
marvelous
the
deep
complex
malt
does
not
have
any
burnt
flavor
and
the
hibernation
ale
is
smooth
right
through
to
the
end
with
no
bitterness
and
a
finish
of
warming
alcohol
great
divide
has
come
up
with
a
great
winter
brew
overall
gotta
give
it
to
the
08
for
shining
through
fun
minivertical
this
has
been
one
of
my
top
favorites
among
the
winter
and
holiday
seasonals
for
several
years
opened
this
one
for
christmas
night
tasting
should
have
put
one
out
for
santa
claus
with
a
turkey
sandwich
and
to
all
a
good
night
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
agian
single
finger
off
white
head
cloudy
amber
body
aroma
is
mostly
a
light
milk
chocolate
lots
of
lacing
flavor
is
more
mile
chocolate
its
actually
very
good
and
unexpected
for
sure
the
aroma
is
overll
light
whereas
the
flavor
is
bold
medium
to
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
though
i
am
not
sure
what
genre
it
should
actually
be
listed
as
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
o
easy
to
drink
and
nice
sweet
flavor
to
it
as
it
warms
me
up
very
good
for
the
season
d
another
good
brew
from
gd
i
enjoyed
this
one
would
like
to
age
one
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
looking
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
head
fades
into
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
nicely
balanced
between
soe
hop
malt
and
some
spice
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
caramel
base
with
some
wooden
flavors
in
there
and
a
light
spicy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
i
though
drinkable
and
medium
bodied
overall
its
not
a
terrible
beer
worth
checking
out
dr
drinkable
but
forgettable
okay
but
not
what
i
expect
in
a
strong
ale
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
o
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
years
round
of
seasonals
i
just
wish
it
was
actually
snowing
when
i
was
drinking
it
overall
another
one
for
the
cellar
great
complexity
which
i
imagine
only
gets
better
with
time
another
sipper
for
sure
a
perfect
beer
to
bite
back
at
the
cold
bought
a
sixer
of
this
for
11
99
a
nice
high
abv
winter
warmer
that
certainly
warms
you
but
its
super
delicious
too
some
dark
fruit
flavors
great
malt
backbone
and
just
enough
hops
this
beer
is
complex
but
well
balanced
a
bit
strong
so
itd
hard
to
have
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
its
a
solid
beer
to
have
a
nice
cold
night
had
in
december
11
labelled
as
being
coldconditioned
for
a
year
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
yellowishbrownbronzed
color
surprisingly
murky
and
completely
opaque
with
a
small
cap
of
head
creamy
in
texture
and
color
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
and
toffee
mild
cocoa
powder
fruity
undertones
and
a
subtle
floral
quality
rich
taste
sweet
woody
chewy
with
caramel
notes
of
figs
raisins
and
even
a
touch
of
banana
with
subtle
hints
of
floral
and
piney
hops
peeking
in
every
now
and
then
very
smooth
mouthfeel
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
pleasantly
drinkable
definitely
recommended
i
should
have
gotten
a
growler
of
it
this
beer
is
packed
with
flavor
but
seems
to
be
out
of
balance
it
seems
heavy
on
the
malt
side
overall
an
impressive
tasting
brew
one
with
nice
sweet
fruit
flavor
that
was
off
set
nicely
by
the
slight
alcohol
tinge
it
possessed
overall
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
for
a
year
old
english
style
old
ale
but
i
was
impressed
nonetheless
a
colossal
beer
pours
a
dead
sexy
glowing
light
brown
color
with
a
sticky
hoppy
looking
lace
head
smells
very
english
in
its
malt
profile
and
has
a
noticable
alcohol
aroma
hops
are
present
in
the
nose
too
as
is
a
pleasant
toffee
waft
taste
is
huge
as
well
big
big
malts
up
front
and
a
bittersweet
hoppy
finish
the
flavor
evolves
in
the
mouth
for
as
long
as
its
held
just
expanding
constantly
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
as
well
with
a
body
that
easily
stands
up
to
the
flavors
and
is
yet
somehow
more
easy
drinking
than
it
should
be
i
cant
imagine
a
more
perfect
cold
weather
beer
just
fantastic
oim
new
to
this
style
but
i
suppose
this
is
a
good
example
based
on
the
style
description
it
is
definitely
a
winter
sipper
for
me
o
after
going
through
a
sixer
of
t6his
over
a
month
or
two
simply
not
bad
but
nothing
special
very
easy
to
drink
very
sweet
fruity
bready
yeasty
aroma
wafts
above
the
head
the
taste
is
a
mingle
between
that
fruitiness
a
bit
of
alcohol
with
a
fresh
faint
hop
leaf
quality
nice
warmth
as
it
goes
down
and
as
it
sits
in
the
stomach
the
beer
makes
its
presence
known
great
old
ale
o
wonderfully
balanced
beer
especially
given
its
gravity
and
alcohol
content
dangerously
easy
to
drink
and
great
for
cooler
fall
and
winter
weather
overall
a
good
wintertime
brew
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
bodied
just
right
for
a
winter
seasonal
overall
hibernation
has
a
great
wintery
character
too
it
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
winters
night
o
a
heavy
fortifying
winter
brew
perfect
for
cold
nights
wind
and
snow
blowing
perhaps
too
sweet
at
times
but
overall
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
winter
seasonal
versus
christmas
seasonal
o
i
call
this
one
a
tie
both
were
solid
old
ales
cold
bottle
poured
into
a
large
glass
drank
s
o
ahh
i
couldnt
think
of
a
better
brew
to
drink
to
fight
the
biting
cold
of
winter
cheers
gd
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
with
nothing
wrong
about
it
its
perfect
for
the
winter
season
rich
malty
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
enough
alcohol
to
get
you
warm
this
was
awesome
maybe
a
little
onenote
flavorwise
but
a
damn
good
note
maybe
a
bit
too
much
like
a
yeti
lite
but
thats
hardly
a
complaint
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
hibernating
with
a
6pack
of
this
all
in
all
an
excellent
winter
warmer
which
is
a
model
of
balance
go
get
some
mo
full
bodied
chewy
astringent
at
times
very
warming
very
complex
this
is
both
a
kick
ass
beer
and
a
beer
that
will
kick
your
ass
it
is
intense
i
like
it
a
lot
not
a
sessionable
beer
but
an
excellent
winter
warmer
as
is
its
intention
d
really
amazing
great
brew
o
a
good
brew
that
i
will
seek
out
again
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
leaves
a
rich
flavor
in
your
mouth
that
is
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
very
well
balanced
hibernation
ale
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
w
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
big
time
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
average
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
i
really
like
the
smell
of
this
beer
its
got
caramel
chocolate
butterscotch
dark
fruit
and
smells
like
a
candy
bar
not
super
complex
but
pleasant
nonetheless
the
flavor
is
a
step
down
from
the
nose
big
time
everything
is
muted
and
the
super
dry
finish
leaves
me
wondering
what
happened
to
the
luxurious
smooth
candy
bar
nose
this
beer
would
be
much
higher
if
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
fell
in
line
w
the
smell
still
its
not
bad
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
cheers
o
good
beer
bready
and
nice
d
tasty
and
flavorful
and
pretty
easy
to
sip
on
as
it
warms
it
becomes
a
bigger
beer
than
expected
and
with
the
alcohol
content
it
really
necessitates
sipping
if
i
had
more
than
one
of
these
though
id
sip
on
them
throughout
the
evening
a
great
ale
for
the
cooler
months
havent
had
a
lot
of
old
ales
as
a
preface
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
though
complex
and
full
would
like
to
see
how
this
beer
is
with
some
age
on
it
moderately
low
carbonation
a
bit
smooth
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
warming
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
wish
we
had
saved
a
few
to
stick
in
the
cellar
but
we
all
liked
it
too
much
o
this
is
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
or
wanting
but
its
pretty
good
this
should
be
in
a
catagory
of
its
own
ive
always
that
of
this
as
a
winter
barleywine
start
with
a
semicold
one
and
let
it
warm
completely
this
beer
really
transitions
and
becomes
complex
when
warm
ive
always
had
it
fresh
as
its
so
hard
to
age
because
i
always
end
up
drinking
it
o
overall
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
the
flavor
isnt
that
complex
but
it
still
tastes
good
the
alcohol
level
was
just
right
for
the
style
while
the
use
of
some
more
unique
hops
might
have
improved
this
beer
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
sip
during
the
winter
drinkability
and
overall
impression
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
for
sipping
slowly
ill
certainly
be
happy
to
have
this
one
again
in
the
future
and
may
look
for
some
to
put
away
in
the
basement
to
see
what
happens
with
a
year
or
two
of
bottle
age
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
big
warm
richly
flavored
beer
that
is
well
made
and
well
balanced
and
well
worth
trying
overalldrinkability
this
was
a
really
amazingly
balanced
beer
and
i
found
it
so
drinkable
that
i
really
found
it
hard
not
to
drink
this
beer
so
quickly
by
far
best
beer
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
and
just
so
delicious
probably
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
beer
i
have
had
really
good
another
solid
beer
from
great
divide
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
highly
recommended
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
may
be
my
first
englishstyle
old
ale
but
it
likely
wont
be
my
last
great
divide
has
another
winner
my
kind
of
old
ale
enjoyed
from
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
pepsiruby
color
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
complex
toffee
and
fruit
flavors
without
being
overly
rich
touch
of
smoke
and
the
dry
hopping
helps
hide
the
alcohol
content
carbonation
is
present
but
not
overly
fizzy
drinks
easy
with
savor
in
every
sip
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
skim
head
which
gives
way
to
just
edging
when
you
hold
the
beer
to
the
light
the
color
is
revealed
as
a
ruby
red
color
with
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
and
of
a
slight
chocolate
along
with
some
caramel
malt
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
big
chocolate
taste
in
the
middle
of
the
the
beer
there
is
then
a
pear
bite
of
flavor
on
the
backend
to
finish
out
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
it
was
a
good
taste
and
had
a
nice
aroma
o
good
beer
for
a
winters
night
might
not
be
the
first
old
ale
i
go
to
but
certainly
pleasing
o
theres
always
something
about
great
divides
beers
that
are
just
so
damn
good
something
that
could
overshadow
even
the
biggest
palate
faults
even
better
though
is
that
there
really
arent
that
many
pitfalls
in
this
beers
flavor
the
unusual
lime
bite
of
the
hops
is
just
added
goodness
with
beer
like
this
great
divide
powers
through
the
realms
of
both
oldworld
style
and
american
creativity
i
dont
know
which
is
represented
more
but
one
things
for
sure
this
old
ale
style
just
keeps
getting
more
and
more
interesting
dont
expect
an
englishstyle
old
ale

a

seems

an

some

along

roasted

are
at

giving
this

a

of
dryness

and
there
is
some

not
much
from
the

there
is
a
little
alcohol
poking
through
on

making

overall
this
is
an

expected

than
that

even
though
it
is
an
english

was

the

the
almost

however
the

this
malty
no

noticeable
i
think
this
beer
would
age
beautifully
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
relatively
low
due
to
the
high
viscosity
but
i
wouldnt
think
twice
about
drinking
23
of

good

smells
of

roasted

a
sugary

and
a
hint
of
smoke
fits
the
style
of
an
english

mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick

an

and
a

up

then
some
good

flavors
roasted

next
a

background
and
more
alcohol
in

overall
great
flavors
but
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
very
well
id
still
recommend
this
brew
but
it
does
pack
a
punch
extra
very
good
beer
very
bitter
but
still
has
robust
malt
not
a
quencher
but
a
great
pizza
beer
i
am
going
to
enjoy
my
second
bottle
with
pizza
cant
wait
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
this
for
sure
purchased
as
a
singlemight
have
to
pick
up
some
more
a
perfect
beer
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
watery
for
a
big
beer
like
this
it
is
disappointing
decent
carbonation
just
too
slick
taste
is
a
big
wallop
of
nuttiness
that
i
was
not
expecting
some
of
the
bitter
walnut
aftertaste
in
there
im
also
getting
some
raisin
booze
and
slight
spiciness
not
bad
im
glad
i
got
this
and
id
most
likely
get
it
again
next
winter
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
1
at
a
time
d
the
only
drawback
would
be
the
abv
i
could
see
where
some
might
be
turned
off
by
some
of
the
booze
that
comes
through
here
at
least
for
me
but
i
find
it
to
be
a
greatly
balanced
beer
where
the
booze
is
necessary
i
may
want
to
drink
more
of
these
than
i
should
because
i
think
this
is
a
superb
excellently
balanced
beer
that
i
think
is
one
of
the
more
underrated
selections
out
there
id
love
to
age
this
stuff
another
year
but
i
drank
it
all
and
cant
find
anymore
around
chitown
big
fan
and
one
of
my
personal
favorites
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
with
a
tannish
colored
head
okay
has
a
very
hoppy
aroma
with
some
malts
fresh
fizzy
smelling
also
coffee
has
a
coffee
taste
malty
nutty
balanced
somewhat
by
the
hops
some
alcohol
o
this
certainly
a
delicious
brew
that
is
well
balanced
in
flavor
with
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
and
a
bouquet
i
would
love
to
see
what
this
does
in
a
year
or
two
i
could
drink
a
bomber
of
this
although
ive
only
seen
it
in
12oz
bottles
not
draft
either
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
me
particularly
for
the
style
and
age
its
a
drinkable
old
ale
for
sure
but
its
definitely
an
american
take
on
the
style
lacking
the
intense
malt
centralization
that
characterizes
the
english
versions
that
define
the
style
great
price
and
availability
increases
the
drinkabilty
for
sure
i
should
try
to
age
a
few
at
some
point
weird
beer
at
first
but
as
the
palate
acclimated
got
better
split
the
difference
in
the
score
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
the
style
and
abv
goes
down
easily
thanks
to
good
balance
and
well
masked
alcohol
one
of
the
finest
winter
warmers
ive
tasted
looking
forward
to
spending
more
time
with
this
next
holiday
md
nice
drinking
brew
a
2008
that
i
consumed
fresh
i
look
forward
to
putting
the
next
one
away
for
a
year
to
compare
d
pretty
smooth
for
a
fresh
old
ale
i
do
not
really
dig
the
flavor
but
who
knows
with
some
time
on
this
it
may
turn
into
something
totally
different
overall
a
nice
balance
but
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
have
melded
lacks
a
fruity
brandylike
underpinning
that
makes
a
good
barleywine
imo
bitterness
is
a
bit
astringent
despite
a
year
in
the
cellar
did
the
fruity
elements
drop
out
i
have
had
this
fresh
and
enjoyed
it
aging
may
not
have
benefitted
it
much
not
bad
but
not
great
this
was
sweeter
and
thicker
than
other
old
ale
styles
ive
had
over
the
winter
months
its
packed
with
brown
sugar
and
reminds
of
a
high
alcohol
brown
ale
at
points
definitely
something
ill
need
to
get
more
of
and
a
new
winter
classic
that
will
be
on
my
list
every
season
drinkability
tried
it
when
i
first
bought
it
in
2007
have
one
left
gonna
store
it
for
at
least
another
year
or
so
and
then
compare
it
to
that
years
batch
will
be
going
back
to
this
one
as
often
as
possible
it
is
a
rich
and
rewarding
beer
in
all
of
the
sensory
experience
compartments
truly
worth
a
try
for
a
winter
brew
its
not
so
drinkable
for
an
old
ale
in
my
limited
experience
with
the
style
its
good
enough
picked
up
a
single
at
charleston
beer
exchange
pours
dark
dark
amber
with
a

that
stays
around
for
a
very

time
nice
sticky
lacing
rims
the
glass
with
every
sip
aroma
is
of
strong
roasted
malts
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
alcohol
is
very
evident
throughout
with
a
nice
warming
finish
a
beer
that
is
to
partaken
slowly
savoring
every
sip
edit
returning
to
this
beer
three
months
later
i
found
the
raw
chocolate
flavors
had
intensified
a
great
deal
and
the
mouthfeel
was
creamier
delicious
pours
a
deep
caramel
with
a
decent
initial
head
and
some
lacing
smell
is
balance
between
malt
and
hops
taste
starts
with
a
tad
of
malt
sweetness
a
kick
of
hops
and
harsh
alcohol
overall
i
believe
i
will
age
some
of
these
bottles
to
see
if
they
become
less
harsh
because
of
the
alcohol
harshness
the
mouthfeel
is
likewise
harsh
drinkability
also
suffers
a
tad
will
revisit
in
another
6
months
im
in
heaven
im
glad
i
finally
found
this
i
will
be
trying
to
get
it
every
year
to
see
how
it
ages
over
time
drinkability
pretty
good
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
merits
all
the
awards
on
the
label
its
good
but
not
spectacular
more
flavor
would
be
ideal
decent
picked
up
a
single
at
liberty
st
tavern
for
home
consumption
this
beer
remidns
me
both
of
a
smokey
scotch
ale
and
an
imperial
brown
ale
the
aroma
has
strong
german
milk
chocolate
scent
like
milka
with
toasted
whole
grain
bread
the
flavor
brings
out
a
sharper
campfire
smoke
taste
along
with
more
of
the
toasty
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
herbal
and
grapefruit
hops
all
in
all
a
very
nice
ale
for
the
winter
dthis
is
one
tasty
beer
a
mix
of
deep
complexity
and
smooth
drinkability
i
think
this
one
is
a
wonderful
winter
brew
poured
a
nice
burnt
orange
and
two
inch
fluffy
white
head
smell
was
very
piney
and
lots
of
sweat
maltiness
as
well
taste
was
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
a
nice
sweet
finish
this
beer
goes
down
very
well
for
a
higher
abv
fist
time
i
have
tried
a
great
divide
beer
but
it
is
worth
searching
out
after
this
delicious
offering
d
i
have
to
say
i
am
impressed
great
brew
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
but
would
be
hammered
after
a
few
abv
is
the
only
thing
that
brings
the
drinkability
down
d
still
quite
good
for
the
price
it
is
a
tasty
treat
ok
but
not
somethin
i
will
go
out
and
purchase
a
very
nice
old
ale
from
great
divide
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
it
really
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
january
evening
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
an
excellent
old
ale
winter
warmer
its
quite
strong
but
man
id
be
happy
to
have
another
one
of
these
a
great
winter
warmer
with
an
almost
perfect
feel
and
taste
its
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
slowly
pushed
forward
by
a
lighter
level
of
carbonation
initially
sweet
and
chocolaty
giving
way
to
a
drying
lactic
acid
and
alcohol
finish
the
finish
threw
me
initially
but
ive
since
warmed
up
to
its
peculiarity
the
mix
of
hops
and
sourness
is
odd
it
should
be
noted
that
the
lactic
acid
presence
is
not
spoilage
fairly
drinkable
old
ale
and
not
quite
as
sweet
or
fruity
as
some
others
of
the
same
style
dark
brown
with
a
slight
copper
in
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
a
sweet
and
hoppy
combination
in
smell
with
a
slight
vanilla
it
is
brown
sugar
with
a
bite
in
taste
the
malt
hits
the
buds
first
and
follows
with
bitterness
leaves
a
little
bit
on
the
tongue
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
like
i
like
this
beer
but
at
this
point
im
thinking
that
i
may
be
a
bit
done
with
the
winter
brews
i
have
to
admit
it
warms
the
tummy
as
you
drink
it
mouthfeel
is
bitter
thick
and
syrupy
creamy
sweet
hop
lingering
roasty
definately
a
sipper
dry
lingering
aftertaste
is
almost
astringent
this
fresh
an
excellent
old
ale
fresh
and
with
some
time
on
it
mmm
medium
body
creamy
feel
with
some
buttery
slipperiness
lightmoderate
carbonation
im
enjoying
this
right
after
a
southern
tier
old
man
and
while
that
was
a
good
beer
this
is
definitely
superior
its
more
flavorful
and
drinkable
and
is
definitely
a
winter
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
its
a
good
beer
for
this
type
but
i
dont
like
this
type
so
its
not
really
for
me
i
liked
it
as
far
as
i
know
i
have
never
had
an
old
ale
im
curious
to
see
how
the
other
ones
are
compared
to
this
one
after
i
drank
another
one
i
enjoyed
much
more
and
finished
the
rest
of
them
so
im
going
to
up
my
ratings
d
a
nice
solid
winter
beer
was
an
interesting
change
of
pace
from
many
of
my
hop
focused
brews
pours
dark
dark
amber
with
a
tan
thick
head
that
stays
around
for
a
very
long
time
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
strong
of
roasted
sweet
malts
in
fact
i
didnt
even
have
to
put
my
nose
to
the
glass
to
smell
it
the
taste
has
a
slight
hop
bite
that
quickly
blends
to
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
alcohol
is
very
evident
but
doesnt
take
away
fromt
the
flavor
infact
the
alcohol
adds
a
nice
warming
effect
d
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
the
hop
character
is
well
done
with
some
flavor
and
aroma
but
an
emphasis
on
bitterness
that
keeps
the
strong
malt
character
from
becoming
cloying
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
an
old
ale
really
extraordinary
beer
get
some
if
you
can
fairly
drinkable
with
an
alcohol
presence
that
is
wellhidden
on
the
palate
but
one
that
shows
itself
afterward
delicious
and
balanced
though
a
great
companion
for
a
cold
night
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
extremely
smooth
and
well
crafted
great
divide
suggests
pairing
with
aged
hard
dutch
cows
milk
cheese
roasted
chicken
and
grilled
veggies
unfortunately
i
had
none
of
that
but
i
can
see
it
going
well
with
any
hearty
meat
and
potatoes
meal
this
brew
is
the
perfect
warmer
on
a
cold
wet
winters
night
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
hazy
brown
in
color
with
a
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
the
taate
is
very
robust
coffee
and
nut
flavors
balacing
with
the
malts
very
malty
and
almost
a
smoky
aftertaste
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
to
date
although
it
is
not
very
much
alike
the
others
ive
had
even
though
it
is
not
like
many
old
ales
it
is
still
an
exceptional
strong
ale
very
nice
interesting
beer
from
great
divide
i
do
enjoy
winter
beers
but
they
tend
to
be
one
dimensional
this
beer
is
more
versatile
and
not
just
for
cold
weather
hibernating
d
this
ones
a
sipper
and
a
damn
good
one
taste
is
even
better
a
real
delicate
taste
of
gingersnaps
caramel
almost
a
date
plumish
sweetness
really
balanced
its
almost
like
this
ive
imagined
that
north
coasts
old
stock
ale
would
become
after
some
cellaring
a
very
good
winter
beer
the
easiest
drinking
old
ale
i
have
ever
had
tasty
and
worth
going
back
for
another
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
just
sit
back
and
marvel
at
once
poured
it
has
a
deep
coppermahogany
color
with
stunning
clarity
and
a
beautiful
head
as
you
drink
it
the
head
sticks
to
the
glass
in
an
array
of
little
bubbles
such
a
nice
looking
brew
the
aroma
gives
off
toasted
biscuit
a
touch
of
raisin
dried
currants
a
little
wet
earth
and
a
good
blast
of
hops
on
the
tongue
this
one
is
no
lightweight
a
lot
of
big
malt
expressions
and
a
liberal
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
yet
it
is
quite
wellbalanced
it
has
a
nice
full
body
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
it
is
strong
without
being
overly
aggressive
after
a
couple
youre
definitely
feeling
warm
inside
which
makes
it
a
great
beer
to
quaff
down
on
a
cold
winters
night
a
big
thumbs
up
for
me
this
beer
is
very
good
great
smell
of
cherries
plum
roasted
grain
and
slight
mocha
taste
is
sweet
malt
slight
oaky
flavor
caramel
sweetness
medium
body
with
warming
effect
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
great
for
the
cold
months
could
definitly
have
another
but
not
too
many
more
the
taste
is
just
too
dominated
by
the
liquor
there
is
a
strong
chocolatey
caramel
toffee
presence
to
the
beer
just
as
the
nose
would
indicate
but
the
alcohol
just
overpowers
what
could
have
been
an
interesting
beer
this
is
a
thick
full
bodied
somewhat
syrupy
sticky
type
of
beer
with
some
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
the
throaty
burn
astringent
bite
from
too
much
alcohol
tis
a
pity
but
this
could
have
been
a
better
beer
drinkability
is
solid
i
could
probably
drink
2
of
these
not
a
session
beer
but
not
a
task
to
drink
either
nose
was
much
more
boozy
than
the
actual
taste
to
me
but
perhaps
it
has
mellowed
a
lot
in
a
year
really
tasty
complex
beer
i
will
have
to
try
again
d
this
is
not
a
style
i
have
regular
experience
with
but
i
have
to
say
i
a
very
large
fan
of
this
beer
its
a
perfectly
warming
winter
beer
just
outstanding
and
every
bit
as
good
as
sam
adams
winter
lager
as
a
warmer
my
next
move
is
to
grab
a
sixer
for
cellaring
this
winter
dont
miss
it
d
not
particularly
sessionable
but
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
its
warming
me
up
quite
nicely
on
this
cold
winter
night
what
a
sensory
smack
very
complex
and
not
for
everyone
the
beer
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
with
ruby
accents
rich
creamy
2
finger
head
fizzes
to
a
dainty
ring
and
some
lacing
very
clear
aromas
of
chocolate
port
and
citrus
from
the
hops
as
the
beer
warms
alcohol
becomes
more
pronounced
flavor
starts
a
smack
in
the
face
of
chocolate
toffee
malts
and
definately
some
sherry
a
very
abrupt
waft
of
hops
usurps
everything
almost
shutting
down
the
flavors
for
a
moment
finish
is
warm
malty
and
somewhat
dry
in
the
mouth
a
full
bodied
beer
with
decent
carbonation
tootsie
roll
chewy
and
thick
presence
of
diacytal
low
drinkability
as
the
alcohol
character
really
develops
in
the
glass
and
become
a
bit
intense
overall
a
challenge
im
up
to
again

great

a
miserable

some
old
ales
pours
dark
brown
with
cherry
hues
and
is
blanketed
by
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
bubbly
tan
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
couple
of
minutes
before
retreating
and
leaving
a
thin
pocked
curvy
lacing
behind
the
initial
whiff
reveals
big
hops
and
almost
nothing
else
on
a
second
whiff
the
complexities
open
up
with
some
sweet
bread
dark
fruits
yeasts
and
medicinal
notes
which
all
come
together
to
form
an
almost
perfect
aromatic
experience
tastes
of
sweet
malts
yeast
caramel
and
spice
with
a
timely
hop
bitterness
thrown
in
for
balance
this
ones
not
too
highly
carbonated
and
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
at
first
but
finishes
with
a
creaminess
that
helps
it
go
down
smooth
with
a
little
alcoholic
aftertaste
behind
this
is
another
exceptional
old
ale
to
add
to
a
tooshort
list
of
old
ales
that
ive
tried
and
must
return
to
dthis
may
be
the
best
winter
seasonal
i
have
had
this
year
as
far
as
warmers
go
it
does
not
get
better
than
this
for
me
pours
a
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
an
amber
hue
nice
frothy
tan
head
that
settled
into
a
solid
ring
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
a
slight
mint
tingle
and
a
subtle
dark
fruit
undercurrent
nice
rich
milk
chocolate
aroma
big
chocolate
in
the
flavor
a
bit
more
of
a
bitter
chocolate
the
hops
are
bitter
and
noticable
but
not
necessarily
specific
some
light
honey
and
perhaps
a
fig
sweetness
not
sure
i
get
old
ale
from
this
definitely
malty
strong
ale
the
feel
is
well
and
chewy
with
enough
of
a
tingley
carbonation
to
keep
the
malt
honest
finishes
with
a
bitter
malt
and
hop
bite
a
very
nice
super
malty
beverage
with
bitter
hop
bite
some
nice
chocolate
flavors
drinkability
a
strange
but
delicious
brew
and
one
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
the
peppermint
thing
is
really
offputting
at
first
at
least
it
was
to
me
but
once
i
recognized
what
i
was
tasting
i
got
into
it
and
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
very
nice
dar
brown
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
head
and
some
very
good
lacing
it
has
a
very
heady
scent
very
earthy
malty
deep
and
dark
same
for
the
taste
a
wonderfully
thick
old
ale
that
feels
like
a
nice
entdrink
i
feel
a
few
inches
taller
all
ready
it
goes
down
great
a
nice
smooth
if
thick
beer
for
such
a
heady
malty
beast
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
i
can
definetley
see
drinking
throughout
the
holidays
its
got
good
characteristics
with
its
malty
profile
and
a
blend
of
the
right
flavors
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
might
have
to
leave
one
of
these
for
santa
instead
of
the
traditional
milk
cookies
an
excellent
beer
for
any
holiday
gathering
purchased
from

creamy

light
toasty
malt

waft
up
from

slowly
dissipating

the
lacing
on
the
glass
is
a
little
thinner
than
expected
but
nothing
to
complain
about
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
ashy
though
but
overall
a
good
winter
ale
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
a
single
bottle
is
enough
for
the
night
the
other
five
bottles
are
going
straight
to
the
cellar
and
i
have
pretty
high
expectations
for
them

somewhat
sweet
and
a
fair
amount
of

upped
the

lovely
lowered
the
drinkability
a
bit
heavy
to
get
through
but
nice
as
for
the
taste
including
the
nice
chocolate
it
has
a
strong
rough
barley
malt
backbone
just
right
to
back
the
chocolate
and
the
end
is
well
balanced
not
sweet
enjoyable
for
sure
definately
worth
a
try
d
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
not
my
favorite
great
divide
product
but
its
not
bad
either
mouthfeel
is
full
medium
bodied
and
nice
carbonation
more
carb
than
id
expect
based
on
what
it
looks
like
but
good
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
the
alcohol
is
high
but
it
never
really
dominates
and
the
flavors
bring
continuous
interest
in
the
beer
good
stuff
heavy
sweet

flavor

the
onset

of
the
style
roasted
malts

drinkability
is
onpar
for
the
style
but
nothing
thats
really
above
beyond
alcohol
is
perceived
but
acceptable
for
an
8
brew
i
enjoyed
this
one
for
sure
but
this
is
certainly
not
one
that
forced
me
to
pay
attention
to
it
like
some
other
great

that
doesnt

now
that
they

me

a
pretty
good
and
very
american
take
on
an

definitely
worth
a
try
the

1
abv
this
beer
is
really
good
rich
but
definitely
one
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
i
could
probably
go
on
and
on
about
the
amazing
taste
mostly
i
just
want
to
get
done
typing
this
so
i
can
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
thing
definitely
an
amazing
beer
this
tops
out
at
8
1
but
the
higher
alcohol
isnt
too
upfront
it
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
after
you
taste
it
youll
see
why
youll
want
to
saver
the
complexity
going
on
here
ok
enough
of
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
thing
05
edition
this
is
a
mighty
fine
old
alestrong
ale
that
drinks
like
a
barleywine
thick
amber
pour
with
an
initial
fluffy
head
that
dwindles
to
a
nice
film
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
hearty
aroma
slight
alcohol
tinge
to
the
nose
heavy
maltiness
with
an
equally
heavy
hop
scent
roasted
malts
and
floral
hops
not
too
thick
on
the
palate
this
is
a
relatively
easy
drink
considering
the
potency
of
this
brew
flavor
is
intense
and
wonderful
thick
dark
malts
of
caramel
and
coffee
along
with
some
bitter
cocoa
thick
hops
rather
floral
with
a
resinous
bitterness
oh
boy
this
is
spectacular
very
enjoyable
on
a
blustery
windy
friday
night
im
not
really
sure
whether
this
ought
to
be
classified
as
an
english
style
old
ale
the
hops
are
too
dominant
for
that
and
if
i
was
being
really
strict
i
would
have
to
score
it
fairly
low
for
being
off
style
it
certainly
wouldnt
do
well
in
a
homebrew
competition
however
it
is
a
very
good
ale
and
a
good
argument
for
the
creation
of
an
american
style
old
ale
category
this
is
approaching
a
sipper
with
such
a
full
body
and
the
high
abv
but
is
very
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
plus
side
old
ales
that
ive
had
another
fine
beer
from
great
divide
d
with
a
8
1
abv
i
am
feeling
this
beer
after
about
half
of
it
i
doubt
i
can
drink
more
than
2
but
it
makes
for
a
great
winter
warmer
pours
a
fairly
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
one
finger
of
relatively
creamy
tan
head
pleasant
aroma
not
overpowering
malty
and
sweet
lots
of
caramel
molasses
toffee
some
slightly
vinous
dried
fruits
taste
is
really
quite
good
very
malty
a
bit
stronger
than
the
aroma
with
lots
of
strong
nutty
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
lots
of
dried
fruit
esters
a
bit
portlike
a
mere
hint
of
alcohol
another
burst
of
malt
before
a
somewhat
dry
finish
good
mouthfeel
with
a
full
slightly
chewy
body
and
lowmoderate
carbonation
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
at
all
overpowering
drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
is
very
complex
nuanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
well
executed
and
a
great
brew
highly
recommended
the
rub
is
that
while
this
beer
has
some
amazing
flavors
its
drinkability
is
pretty
low
often
ill
take
forever
to
finish
one
and
on
a
few
occasions
i
cant
theres
just
something
very
potent
about
it
and
i
dont
mean
booziness
its
almost
just
a
little
too
concentrated
still
split
a
bottle
with
someone
and
youll
love
it
dthis
is
a
good
sipper
i
love
it
in
small
doses
very
nice
this
is
my
first
warmer
of
the
season
i
was
impressed
d
the
mouthfeel
and
extra
alcohol
make
it
a
little
less
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
flavor
is
much
better
thankfully
its
rich
in
malt
with
a
slight
roasty
character
nice
hop
bitterness
great
balance
to
the
equation
this
be
would
an
exceptional
cold
weather
beer
to
sip
slowly
by
the
fire
with
my
girl
and
my
dogs
this
has
a
beautiful
deep
red
color
with
a
thin
residual
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
grains
and
malt
the
body
is
full
and
tastes
of
malty
goodness
with
only
mild
bitterness
underneath
it
finishes
with
a
malty
grainy
aftertaste
this
graininess
isnt
quite
a
barnyard
wet
blanket
flavor
but
a
subtle
form
of
that
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
and
contributes
to
the
experience
overall
its
a
very
tasty
interesting
beer
drinkability
no
bad
but
not
really
my
style
d
abv
masked
well
cant
do
it
all
night
but
one
entices
another
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
big
lacing
head
wow
this
smells
great
aroma
of
piney
hops
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
alchohol
flavor
is
roasted
coffee
caramel
toffee
mmm
bitter
sting
of
hops
at
the
end
lively
carbonation
and
a
very
long
lasting
finish
that
kinda
kills
the
palate
i
could
see
this
one
knocking
me
out
for
the
winter
a
surprising
beer
that
starts
dry
with
dark
malt
caracter
and
then
changes
to
a
more
friendly
beer
with
a
full
taste
dnot
a
session
beer
but
drinkable
enjoyable
but
a
bit
harsh
at
times
id
like
to
see
what
some
more
time
will
do
to
this
one
d
ah
yes
the
drinkability
of
the
hibernation
is
exhilirating
to
say
the
least
sip
on
this
beer
all
night
and
hope
it
does
not
catch
up
with
you
the
hibernation
ale
could
be
the
perfect
night
cap
d
very
good
despite
the
abv
i
could
sense
this
had
an
old
ale
feel
even
though
it
was
described
to
me
as
a
strong
ale
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
nice
amber
malt
and
big
on
hops
a
real
good
ballance
from
start
to
finish
i
think
that
this
one
would
celler
very
well
it
might
take
away
the
slight
ruffness
of
the
the
alcohal
i
wish
that
i
had
more
than
one
of
theese
for
a
style
i
dont
usaly
like
this
one
is
good
impressed
and
a
lot
better
than
the
yeti
i
opened
the
evening
with
in
my
opinion
definitely
recommended
hibernation
is
not
only
one
of
the
better
american
old
ales
ive
had
it
may
be
the
single
most
drinkable
its
delicious
and
a
feather
in
the
cap
for
great
divide
stock
up
when
you
see
it
to
get
you
through
the
year
pours
a
medium
to
dark
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
laces
down
the
entire
glass
smell
is
piny
hops
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
taste
has
a
bit
of
caramel
and
chocolate
creamy
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
definitely
a
sipper
nice
beer
for
a
cold
night
by
the
fire
hibernation
is
a
solid
old
ale
the
flavors
and
aromas
meld
together
nicely
it
is
a
very
pleasant
and
smooth
sipper
and
its
amakin
me
about
ready
for
a
nap
certainly
worthwhile
and
i
would
recommend
i
imagine
it
would
be
much
better
if
drunk
during
winter
months
overall
a
really
tasty
brew
one
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
had
although
bells
still
tops
it
out
wow
what
a
beer
and
at
8
10
what
a
dangerous
beer
if
i
ever
find
this
on
tap
i
might
not
make
it
home
in
one
piece
mild
in
terms
of
carbonation
and
in
the
end
it
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
mild
hoppy
wave
rolling
in
over
your
tongue
as
a
finish
thanks
again
to
tayner
for
this
gem
i
was
impressed
with
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
i
think
that
though
the
dry
hopping
took
center
stage
it
made
for
a
crisp
taste
that
i
could
see
drinking
very
easily
this
was
a
really
good
ale
and
if
i
didnt
have
to
get
back
to
work
i
would
have
drank
quite
a
few
more
443
5
took
a
nice
big
mouthfull
had
a
great
sweet
carmel
malt
with
a
nice
hoppy
balance
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
i
could
definetly
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
a
nice
cold
winter
day
another
great
beer
from
the
guys
at
great
divide
i
cant
wait
to
try
next
years
batch
this
is
a
heavy
beer
notable
in
its
taste
and
apperance
it
has
a
syrupy
character
but
a
relatively
slight
head
the
liquid
is
a
woody
brown
color
opaque
and
somewhat
attractive
the
nose
is
all
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
theres
also
a
distracting
medicinal
or
chlorinelike
aroma
the
taste
is
rich
and
sweet
with
copious
malt
flavors
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
certainly
have
this
again
i
could
drink
several
of
these
on
a
cold
winters
night
great
offering
one
of
the
better
warmers
i
had
this
year
drinkability
the
beer
was
aptly
named
it
has
great
warming
qualities
d
the
alcohol
flavors
come
on
pretty
strong
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
thankfully
thats
balanced
nicely
by
the
all
of
the
roastedtoasted
characteristics
of
this
beer
d
well
hidden
alcohol
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
taste
is
rather
pleasant
drink
this
before
the
warm
weather
gets
here
overall
flavors
have
really
mellowed
and
meshed
making
it
harder
to
dissect
its
very
pleasing
to
drink
but
this
has
become
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
when
fresh
also
im
not
sure
how
much
this
would
have
changed
if
it
were
kept
at
a
warmer
temp
will
find
out
next
month
in
the
end
i
like
this
better
fresh
but
im
holding
out
hope
that
2
yearold
bottles
will
really
develop
into
something
remarkable
drank
another
one
last
night
alcohol
laid
down
a
bit
but
the
caramel
was
still
pretty
strong
this
beer
tasted
completely
different
in
3
months
time
i
really
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
did
and
it
wasnt
bad
to
begin
with
i
raised
the
drinkability
from
3
5
to
4
taste
is
bitter
with
citric
us
hoppy
notes
pretty
aggressive
hop
bite
the
bitterness
is
supported
by
malty
and
roasted
notes
the
beer
is
not
sweet
just
a
little
sticky
to
me
this
beer
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
an
ipa
and
a
barleywine
i
am
not
sure
why
this
is
an
old
ale
let
alone
what
an
old
ale
actually
is
just
grabbed
a
slice
of
blue
cheese
with
this
beer
and
wow
this
beer
tastes
great
in
combination
with
that
the
woody
notes
of
the
beer
are
great
with
the
salty
taste
of
the
cheese
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
last
saturday
night
poured
into
a
stemmed
beer
glass
the
color
was
dark
dark
amber
had
to
be
careful
with
the
second
beer
as
it
forms
quite
a
head
the
smell
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
winter
warmer
with
spice
present
the
taste
was
very
good
a
nice
combination
of
coca
and
cinnamon
on
the
tongue
this
old
ale
had
me
thinking
of
a
porters
mouthfeel
along
with
a
winter
ales
hearty
flavor
a
great
combination
drinkability
being
the
only
issue
as
its
over
8
you
could
start
to
feel
it
kick
in
after
two
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
beer
would
age
over
time
it
would
be
nice
to
see
more
breweries
release
an
old
ale
in
six
pack
format
as
i
could
see
this
style
become
one
of
my
favorites
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
however
i
dont
know
id
want
to
drink
much
of
it
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
served
in
my
great
divide
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
translucent
amber
halfinch
offwhite
head
dissipated
into
a
thin
skim
of
spotty
foam
very
little
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
nose
presented
primarily
as
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
also
detected
taste
was
surprisingly
more
complex
given
the
nose
flavors
of
coffee
and
caramel
with
a
slight
hops
bitterness
at
the
finish
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
a
fair
amount
of
effervescence
considering
the
lack
of
a
head
very
drinkable
alcohol
was
wellhidden
and
the
taste
overall
was
very
much
reminiscent
of
a
nice
malty
coffee
porter
drinkability
a
nice
winter
sipper
i
got
two
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
of
winter
beers
the
two
are
enough
for
me
a
nice
little
treat
on
a
cold
night
near
the
end
of
winter
a
good
tasting
beer
just
not
one
i
want
a
lot
of
leading
to
the
lower
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
well
balanced
with
a
great
mouthfeel
you
dont
want
to
drink
this
very
fast
though
pours
a
five
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
johns
marketplace
portland
or
i
sampled
this
brew
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
one
finger
head
it
smelled
of
roasted
malts
and
nice
floral
hops
coldnt
wait
to
take
a
drink
flavor
delivers
on
all
fronts
nice
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
balanced
with
the
malt
sweetness
pours
a
clear
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
big
creamy
tan
head
terrific
lacing
to
boot
a
nice
foam
ring
is
left
in
the
wake
of
each
sip
smells
fruity
dark
fruits
in
particular
figs
sweet
malts
and
citrus
notes
taste
is
more
sweet
dark
ripe
fruits
figs
cherries
malty
and
finishes
with
a
great
dry
hop
bite
mouthfeel
is
rich
full
bodied
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
with
a
dry
finish
nice
warming
effects
going
on
as
well
without
any
harshness
in
the
flavor
very
drinkable
on
these
cold
winter
nights
this
brew
has
an
excellent
finish
ill
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
these
lower
carbonation
and
a
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
be
aware
of
the
higher
abv
and
enjoy
this
brew
in
moderation
d
this
is
a
really
great
beer
i
really
like
all
of
the
flavors
presented
here
they
are
quite
a
different
tone
than
most
beers
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
and
the
soft
earthy
and
toasty
notes
are
perfect
for
a
winter
snow
day
the
beer
poured
a
deep
reddishblack
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
into
a
12oz
pilsner
glass
the
smell
was
of
currantblack
cherry
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
fantastic
the
initial
taste
was
of
the
currantblack
cherry
component
but
transitioned
quickly
into
a
big
roasted
toasted
malt
finish
with
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
this
seems
more
like
an
imperial
stout
than
an
old
ale
but
im
nitpicking
an
outstanding
effort
great
on
a
cold
winters
day
a
very
smooth
and
malty
ale
for
the
winter
months
very
good
example
of
an
old
english
ale
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
my
regular
winter
beers
dont
miss
this
one
this
was
an
excellent
beer
the
taste
was
very
unique
almost
like
bread
the
mouthfeel
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
as
it
was
almost
chewy
a
very
warming
beer
and
yet
another
great
addition
to
the
great
divide
arsenal
pours
a
nice
sturdy
head
with
a
vibrant
blend
between
caramel
and
carmalized
brown
sugar
the
taste
starts
with
raisin
and
apples
that
fades
into
a
silky
butterscotch
mid
palate
some
spicy
hops
come
marching
in
at
the
finish
to
balance
out
this
wonderful
malty
brew
one
of
the
best
winter
ales
available
this
beer
poured
nice
and
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
rosie
hue
a
bit
of
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
but
long
enough
to
look
prettty
which
is
all
that
matters
right
aroma
is
malty
and
hoppy
it
is
a
nice
change
from
the
pineycitrusy
american
hops
i
am
used
to
lately
it
has
an
herbal
and
earthy
quality
that
melds
nicely
with
the
fruity
malt
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
big
bitter
kick
at
the
end
with
the
finish
it
has
i
would
almost
call
this
an
ipa
but
alas
there
is
a
ton
of
fruit
raisin
plum
action
going
on
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
it
has
a
nice
english
hop
character
and
again
killer
bitterness
the
bitterness
really
saves
the
drinkability
as
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
a
little
cloying
without
it
mouthfeel
is
a
little
rich
but
with
a
prickly
carbonation
the
bitter
finish
and
carbonation
really
lighten
it
up
and
enhance
the
drinkability
all
in
all
a
great
beer
thanks
j
tastes
of
sweet
sugary
malts
with
fruit
alcohol
esthers
and
lots
of
hops
which
pull
through
especially
well
on
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
viscous
on
the
palate
with
some
sticky
alpha
acids
that
make
for
a
puckering
finish
hibernation
is
definately
a
sipping
beer
its
heavy
and
laden
with
flavor
and
complexity
ill
be
back
for
more
next
winter
pours
a
very
cola
like
color
hazy
rubybrown
mixture
with
12
inch
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
little
lacing
smells
are
amazing
lots
of
oak
and
vanilla
as
well
as
caramel
chocolate
cream
dark
fruit
earthy
hops
and
alcohol
tastes
just
as
good
as
it
smells
lots
of
vanilla
and
toffee
dark
fruits
such
as
cherries
and
raisins
maple
sugar
and
bitter
chocolate
with
pine
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
medium
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
nice
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
gives
off
a
very
warming
feeling
definitely
a
nice
beer
for
warming
up
from
the
cold
or
as
a
nightcap
a
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
big
tan
head
that
settles
and
lots
of
clumpy
lace
there
is
a
sharp
chocolate
aroma
with
odd
citrus
hops
overtones
its
a
very
unusual
smell
that
is
not
immediately
recognizable
or
even
obviously
attractive
the
taste
is
smooth
and
heavy
with
charcoal
chocolate
plenty
of
alcohol
a
bit
winelike
i
wouldnt
call
this
highly
drinkable
but
it
has
a
real
quality
feel
in
its
body
its
a
bit
too
heavy
for
my
tastes
but
it
is
good
recommended
to
those
who
prefer
some
weight
to
their
brews
this
beer
pours
with
a
decent
sized
cappuccino
like
head
that
dissipates
to
wisps
leaving
some
bubbles
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
fairly
clear
dark
amber
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
up
front
with
chocolate
notes
with
very
subtle
fruit
and
hop
aromas
the
taste
is
very
much
as
would
be
expected
up
front
with
the
chocolate
followed
with
a
subtle
fruityness
cherrys
and
bit
of
hop
flavor
you
can
also
taste
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
hotness
as
it
goes
down
your
throat
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
dryness
from
the
hops
this
beer
is
low
in
carbonation
and
incredibly
smooth
for
a
8
1
beer
overall
a
nice
winter
seasonal
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
ages
i
have
only
seen
this
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
once
and
grabbed
this
six
pack
in
late
2006
with
little
to
no
question
this
was
probably
not
aged
entirely
properly
in
the
store
but
has
been
kept
cellared
properly
since
an
amazing
aged
brew
dark
ruby
brown
appearance
off
white
head
falls
to
some
sticky
lacing
aromas
of
carmel
toffee
green
leafy
hops
kinda
has
a
herbal
smell
tastes
of
chocolate
malt
carmel
roasted
nuts
spice
and
has
a
nice
earthy
piney
hop
finish
slight
alcohol
warming
after
each
sip
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
sticky
drinkability
is
fantastic
i
couldnt
put
my
glass
down
if
i
have
the
will
power
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
does
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
another
solid
brew
from
great
divide
highly
recommended
d
solid
i
reviewed
this
only
because
i
had
a
vintageone
last
week
and
forgot
to
review
it
this
one
was
fresh
cellaring
this
baby
for
a
year
does
wonders
but
it
is
still
very
nice
fresh
give
it
a
go
d
nice
tasting
brew
especially
after
working
in
the
snow
all
day
a
very
good
night
cap
brew
would
love
to
see
how
this
holds
up
to
some
age
prettylooking
lacking
a
little
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
all
in
all
pretty
good
there
are
others
id
rather
have
however
tried
to
get
through
this
couldnt
hopefully
my
last
drainpour
of
2007
overall
decent
to
good
drinkable
interesting
a
nice
winter
warmer
and
worth
drinking
while
i
think
that
great
divides
high
gravity
beers
are
among
the
best
in
their
respective
classes
i
have
typically
not
been
very
impressed
with
gds
standards
hibernation
sort
of
straddles
the
line
between
the
huge
beers
and
the
lackluster
standards
and
does
it
well
its
not
amazing
but
its
solid
and
id
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
of
all
the
winter
offerings
out
there
i
like
this
one
quite
truly
a
good
beer
i
think
i
get
another
six
pack
to
enjoy
it
on
a
winters
night
hopefully
available
in
the
netherlands
at
8
1
abv
it
can
be
overpowering
and
it
definitely
has
a
mood
altering
affect
that
will
induce
hibernation
moderate
carbonation
and
a
relatively
crisp
texture
despite
its
heavierroasty
nature
smooth
with
lots
of
warmth
in
the
finish
a
nice
toasty
pleasurable
cold

brew
an
american
old
ale
a
nice
attempt
but
the
hops
seem
to
overshadow
the
malt
bordering
more
on
an
american
barleywine
good
but
not
my
favorite
from
this
amazing
brewery
this
is
a
good
winter
brew
for
folks
like
me
who
do
not
like
the
holiday
spiced
beersbut
not
something
i
would
seek
out
year
round
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation

abv
is
pretty
good
for
this
beer
its
blended
well
and
not
very
noticeable
goes
down
pretty
smooth
drinkability
is
good
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
great
divide
mouthfeel
was
very
average
lack
of
a
good
hop
presence
decreased
my
interest
in
having
another
so
i
downgraded
the
drinkability
served
in
a
pint
glass
a
deep
reddark
brown
brew
with
a
slight
skin
of
head
that
clung
to
the
surface
for
a
while
nose
was
biscuits
and
malts
taste
was
nutty
maybe
hazelnuts
malty
and
slight
hops
on
the
end
not
too
shabby
slight
alcohol
as
well
mouthfeel
was
good
on
one
hand
the
warming
alcohol
of
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
cold
night
like
tonight
but
on
the
other
hand
the
hops
after
awhile
tend
to
become
the
dominant
flavor
from
this
beer
and
for
some
people
that
might
become
a
bit
too
much
to
handle
its
not
a
session
beer
thats
for
sure
is
this
a
beer
that
you
could
have
one
or
two
whilst
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
reading
a
book
watching
some
late
night
television
while
it
is
cold
outside
of
course
it
is
but
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
winterspecific
beers
that
are
better
suited
and
not
as
possessing
in
hops
i
would
probably
rank
this
above
the
overlysweet
barley
wines
and
over
coffeedroasted
maltd
stouts
because
it
most
certainly
is
a
nice
and
unique
interpretation
of
an
old
ale
it
just
goes
back
to
the
adage
of
why
mess
with
a
good
thing
i
almost
find
myself
wishing
that
great
divide
had
kept
the
recipe
a
little
closer
to
the
classic
style
with
this
one
this
is
my
first
great
divide
beer
and
im
nothing
if
not
excited
to
see
what
they
do
with
their
other
styles
nothing
if
not
a
beer
that
makes
you
think
peeling
labels
did
detract
a
bit
from
the
appearance
of
the
bottle
but
dont
let
that
stop
youi
d
hmm
under
10
for
a
six
pack
of
this
that
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
the
taste
is
also
wonderful
for
a
seasonal
offering
one
of
the
most
solid
winter
offerings
its
easy
to
make
a
big
malty
brew
its
not
so
simple
to
craft
a
blended
balanced
down
to
earth
mondo
ale
but
this
is
sparkling
evidence
that
it
can
indeed
be
accomplished
make
no
mistake
the
abv
is
a
snippy
bitch
but
well
worth
bearing
for
another
one
or
two
should
the
next
morning
permit
it
and
if
i
make
it
to
a
third
or
fourth
well
ill
likely
live
up
to
this
beers
name
for
a
day
or
two

i
like
a

side

good
solid
old
ale
drink
this
one
all
day
long
a
little
too
much
alcohol
to
be
really
drinkable
after
a
couple
you
really
start
to
feel
it
this
has
been
one
of
my
holiday
favorites
the
last
few
years
d
a
solid
offering
and
definitely
a
great
selection
for
winter
drinking
if
i
could
find
this
in
my
area
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
interesting
tasty
appropriately
malty
with
a
glimpse
of
bitter
leafy
hops
coming
through
a
good
one

sip
on

winter
weather
part
three
of
a
night
of
great
divide
this
is
the
2007
edition
of
the
hibernation
seasonal
this
ale
has
a
very
hearty
appearance
fairly
opaque
dark
amber
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
crisp
with
hints
of
hops
and
spices
mixed
together
within
the
flavor
you
get
chocolate
brown
sugar
along
with
a
spice
that
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
texture

nice
with
a

familiar
to

with

to
get
excited
about
but
satisfying
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
such
a
brew
barrelaging
renders
it
almost
undrinkable
i
always
passed
this
one
up
because
of
the
price
tag
but
thats
been
a
mistake
what
a
wonderful
brew
this
is
tasting
not
a
whole
lot
like
its
original
base
beer
but
becoming
something
entirely
different
more
like
a

than
anything

think
deep

glowing

and
of

bourbon
a

the
taste
too
starts
off
with

vanilla
hit
followed
by
waves
of
sweet

and
old

i
even
get
a
little
charred
spice
in
there
towards
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
so
subtle
here
its
there
but
way
back
a
perfect
winter
beer
especially
when
its
warm
it
takes
regular
hibernation
to
a
whole
new
level
the
barrel
has
not
only
added
flavor
and
strength
but
a
refinement
of
the
feel
carbonation
has
settles
body
has
amplified
and
this
drinks
like
a
glass
of
cognac
really
special
stuff
from
great
divide
among
their
best
o
overall
it
has
alot
of
rich
rustic
flavors
to
it
but
that
really
high
carbonation
level
gets
in
the
way

i
am
disappointed
i
love

and
plan
on
buying
another
case
when
it
comes

flavor
i
would
say
this
falls
flat
and
i
would
recommend
against
it
maybe
with
just
1
year
on
it
it
would
maintain
but
not
what
i
had
overall
a
good
big
beer
nothing
amazing
going
on
but
solid
and
drinkable
overall
with
minimal
knowledge

if

this
is
the

for
you
overall

almost

the

not

hmph
i
have
to

is

than

barrel
aging
doesnt

to
have

it
ends
up
being

does

i

it
made
it
out
to
here
o
pretty

the

barrel
is
prominent
without
being
hot
or
overbearing
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
o
i
payed

for
this
beer
and
i
wouldnt
do
it
again
seems
like
this
beer
is
somewhat
hard
to
get
and
its
pretty
good
so
im
not
unhappy
about
the
purchase
i
had
a
ba
4d
last
night
as
well
and
this
isnt
standing
up
to
it
especially
for
that
price
tag
if
you
like
whiskey
or
boiler
makers
get
this
brew
i
enjoyed
it
because
of
that
but
at
the
same
time
prefer
a
bit
more
balance
and
maltsweetness
presence
in
this
kind
of
beer
cant
wait
to
try
ba
old
ruffian
and
yeti
oi
love
whiskey
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
it
is
100
whiskey
barrel
forward
and
can
be
fatiguing
in
quantities
over
68oz
but
a
nice
barrel
aged
winter
warmer
would
buy
again
even
though
its
pricey
i
love
barrel
aged
beers
i
really
expected
a
lot
more
from
the
beer
expectations
were
high
but
at
best
this
was
maybe
slightly
above
average
and
needs
some
work
by
great
divide
a
cloudy
dirt
brown
s
nothing
special
t
tastes
were
muted
and
bland
very
average
i
really
really
wished
and
hoped
there
were
more
but
it
just
was
not
there
it
seems
the
barrel
aging
gave
this
beer
a
kinda
musty
taste
m
somewhat
weird
combined
with
the
off
tastes
not
that
enjoyable
o

i

the

runs
a

if
this

quite

malt
sweet
alcohol
wood
toffee
caramel
and
subtle
brown
sugar
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
solid
brew
the
barrels
really
shined
through
on
this
one
and
made
their
presence
known
i
wasnt
expecting
this
as
the
brew
had
been
aging
in
my
cellar
for
this
long
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
what
i
did
find
a
solid
offering
from
great
divide
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
bottle
of
ba
old
ruffian
i
have
in
my
cellar
to
conplete
the
set
overall
this
was
a
nice
offering
but
lacked
the
overall
quality
i
was
hoping
for
with
this
beer
the
whiskey
barrel
really
overwhelmed
the
base
beer
leaving
the
flavor
profile
slightly
one
dimentional
while
is
was
tasty
i
wont
be
seeking
out
any
more
with
great
effort
in
the
near
future
mouthfeel
thin
and
not
much
carbonation
yikes
heres
where
the
age
murdered
the
beer
edit
really
picked
up
with
a
lot
of
air
thin
gaps
disappeared
more
but
still
evident
so
a
slight
correction
in
rating
smell
is
sweet
malts
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
toffee
caramel
and
oak
surrounded
in
whiskey
taste
follows
nicely
with
rich
flavors
providing
a
fairly
sweet
old
ale
that
is
thick
with
low
carbonation
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
darn
good
and
yet
i
am
dissapointed
maybe
its
past
its
prime
i
dont
dislike
it
but
its
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
too
boozy
a
touch
too
thin
but
still
very
good
overall
a
very
tasty
offering
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
would
certainly
enjoy
having
it
again
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
sweet
like
candy
on
the
front
there
is
a
nice
bourbon
presence
in
the
midpalate
and
the
finish
is
appropriately
heavy
and
not
dry
there
is
not
much
bitterness
at
the
back
less
than
i
expected
which
shifts
my
focus
to
the
front
half
of
the
beer
leaving
me
with
nothing
to
linger
on
in
the
back
the
flavors
of
toffee
and
caramel
are
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
booziness
of
the
midpalate
and
booziness
is
not
out
of
place
for
the
overall
experience
of
the
beer
i
really
enjoyed
a
sleeper
beer
for
sure
people
should
be
more
excited
about
this
one
the
base
beer
is
also
quite
good
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
great
old
ale
i
loved
the
taste
and
would
have
liked
a
little
more
bourbon
in
the
nose
and
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
but
still
an
awesome
beer
would
love
to
try
again
sometime
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
and
is
slightly
murky
nose
contained
a
good
amount
of
toffee
as
well
as
some
light
caramel
some
brown
sugar
and
light
barrel
character
there
as
well
not
super
complex
but
the
barrel
character
was
seriously
nice
coming
through
particularly
well
in
the
finish
which
was
exquisite
taste
was
caramel
and
bourbon
nice
mouthfeel
was
ridiculously
smooth
and
lacked
nearly
any
alcohol
presence
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
a
nice
offering
and
the
mouthfeel
was
really
killer
big
highlight
for
me

tried
this
beer
at
donnellys
in
fairport
new
york
exceptional
taste
and
surprisingly
high
in
abv
despite
it
not
tasting
like
it
should
be
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
those
looking
for
a
very
flavorful
beer
thats
not
incredibly
heavy
creamy
mdlight
in
the
mouth
with
mild
carbonation
great
drinkability
and
this
will
improve
in
a
couple
years
as
the
alcohol
heat
settles
more
and
the
flavors
meld
together
certainly
a
strange
barrelaged
old
ale
the
whiskey
barrel
didnt
impart
much
of
the
caramel
and
vanilla
sweetness
ive
come
to
expect
from
this
type
of
beer
but
that
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
its
a
leathery
tannic
fairly
oxidized
and
complex
sipper
d
its
good
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
pours
a
thinnish
looking
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
huge
bourbon
aromas
dominate
but
there
is
also
vanilla
toffee
oak
and
dark
fruit
huge
boozy
palate
with
loads
of
bourbon
eventually
i
get
a
little
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
before
the
warming
alcohol
takes
over
totally
different
from
the
original
hibernation
great
drinkability
a
luxury
that
alas
may
not
stack
up
to
many
other
old
ales
barrel
aged
or
not
if
you
are
seeking
value
for
your
dollar
thrilled
to
have
tried
this
but
was
expecting
more
to
be
honest
d
unique
beer
nice
to
try
not
for
the
session
overall
a
nice
change
up
for
me
i
thought
it
could
have
been
a
little
bigger
for
the
time
it
spent
in
the
barrel
it
was
very
mellow
and
nicely
done
maybe
with
a
year
or
so
on
it
it
will
really
start
to
flourish
overall
this
was
pretty
decent
the
ale
is
a
little
to
light
and
the
flavor
didnt
really
soak
up
the
oak
and
the
bourbon
as
much
im
a
big
fan
of
the
regular
hibernation
and
to
me
this
isnt
quite
as
good
its
completely
dominated
by
the
barrel
character
which
overshadows
the
solid
beer
underneath
im
hoping
and
expecting
this
one
to
age
well
and
get
better
with
a
little
time
this
beer
really
needs
some
age
it
is
drinking
really
hot
and
it
is
difficult
to
get
anything
but
alcohol
out
of
the
flavor
drinks
well
for
11
and
should
age
well
for
years
to
come
overall
this
is
not
overdone
with
the
alcohol
like
the
bourbon
yeti
was
both
barrel
versions
ive
had
have
been
very
lightly
carbonated
im
surprised
by
how
subdued
the
flavors
were
for
me
given
how
complex
original
hibernation
is
its
interesting
to
try
but
regular
hibernation
is
better
and
this
is
not
worth
25
a
bottle
bottle
376492
25
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
regular
version
so
i
gave
up
the
25
for
this
one
which
i
will
say
is
not
as
good
as
the
regular
version
unless
you
really
like
whiskey
it
might
be
a
shade
darker
than
the
standard
version
or
maybe
its
just
hazier
it
smells
like
whiskey
alcohol
really
an
interesting
smell
the
flavor
is
really
overwhelmed
by
the
barrelaging
to
the
point
that
i
can
barely
tell
its
hibernation
any
more
whiskey
wood
alcohol
vanilla
intense
but
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
an
amazing
beer
that
would
be
perfect
for
those
cold
nights
by
the
fire
or
just
any
time
worth
remembering
note
if
you
dont
like
barrel
aged
beers
or
are
expecting
this
to
taste
like
regular
hibernation
dont
bother
with
this
one
as
the
barrel
aging
has
completely
changed
the
character
of
the
beer
from
regular
hibernation
but
if
you
like
ba
brews
youll
probably
like
this
one
a
lot
overall
a
big
mess
that
was
not
enjoyable
at
all
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
them
and
they
have
some
decent
beers
so
this
was
a
big
letdown
maybe
just
a
bad
batch
or
bottle
but
not
good
poured
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
small
pint
glass
served
cool
pours
a
brownish
red
body
and
a
beige
head
smells
of
sugar
candy
and
light
rose
tastes
of
jolly
rancher
candy
bready
and
fruit
stone
floral
hop
aftertaste
medium
body
and
carbonation
might
want
the
carb
to
be
somewhat
more
subdued
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
far
from
a
hop
bomb
but
not
well
layered
in
the
grain
area
however
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
nothing
outstanding
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
alcohol
in
the
nose
is
a
bit
cloying
a
good
representation
of
an
old
ale
but
probably
not
a
repeat
buy
odprobably
one
of
my
least
favorite
ipswich
beers
it
isnt
awful
and
i
respect
that
they
went
for
a
different
style
in
the
season
winter
warmers
just
doesnt
please
me
as
much
as
nearly
every
other
ipswich
brew
i
have
drank
one
bomber
at
around
3
50
is
a
good
price
but
i
will
only
be
drinking
this
once
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
i
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
cheers
the
head
forms
nicely
but
quickly
disintegrates
into
the
body
of
beer
lacing
is
weak
leaving
a
ring
around
the
liquid
the
taste
is
a
little
unbalanced
hops
hits
the
tongue
first
but
is
greatly
overpowered
by
a
mix
of
ethanol
and
malts
leaves
a
blandness
on
the
tongue
but
not
too
stagnant
to
hasten
me
for
a
swig
of
water
to
wash
it
off
smooth
on
the
mouth
not
too
carbonated
very
drinkable
old
ale
but
one
is
enough
for
me
beer
is
nearly
flavorless
mild
malt
dry
finish
mild
spice
really
boring
super
boring
im
done
o
another
solid
beer
from
ipswich
a
little
heavy
but
besides
that
a
well
rounded
old
ale
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
light
brown
head
not
much
in
the
lacing
or
retention
departments
aroma
of
winter
spices
and
caramel
winter
spices
start
this
one
out
fairly
timid
slight
dark
fruit
and
toffeecaramel
malt
give
this
one
some
balance
roasted
notes
and
more
spice
close
it
out
nice
flavor
combination
but
fairly
standard
brew
pours
a
one
finger
head
tan
in
color
where
is
the
smell
not
much
but
a
touch
of
sweet
carmel
maybe
bready
yeast
acrid
coffee
tastes
carmel
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
some
weird
sharp
acrid
bitterness
some
lingering
weird
bitterness
as
well
with
some
acidity
i
know
this
sounds
redundant
but
this
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
i
may
not
finish
this
what
went
wrong
for
this
beer
i
may
never
know
1
80
a
single
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
example
of
a
winter
ale
i
do
wish
it
were
a
little
less
bitter
though
drinkability
this
one
really
grew
on
me
another
fine
great
one
from
the
mercury
brewing
company
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
and
seems
to
have
just
the
right
muscle
to
take
care
of
its
self
as
it
washes
down
your
palette
there
is
no
lingering
aftertaste
unless
this
beer
is
warmer
then
recommended
lightly
hazed
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
meager
cap
of
beige
bubbles
more
of
a
collar
with
wisps
of
foam
than
a
full
head
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
malty
aroma
lots
of
roasted
and
toasty
notes
bready
with
light
citrus
caramel
flavours
of
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
earthy
fruits
plums
and
raisins
with
low
bitterness
notes
of
caramel
roast
and
leafyspicy
hops
fairly
bready
and
yeasty
as
it
warmed
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
decent
texture
a
bit
slick
my
overall
impression
was
that
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
d
you
might
get
tired
of
the
chocolate
flavor
yet
i
bought
a
case
of
this
stuff
so
you
be
the
judge
this
is
a
sessionable
old
ale
if
that
makes
sense
a
good
beer
and
i
may
revisit
this
in
the
future
picked
up
a
twelve
pack
to
share
with
friends
on
a
saturday
night
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
auburn
red
highlights
moderate
sized
head
fairly
nice
amount
of
lacing
smell
reminded
me
of
a
hint
of
cocoa
taste
had
ample
amounts
of
malt
and
smoked
peat
flavors
with
a
nice
biscuit
bread
aftertaste
would
have
enjoyed
the
beer
just
a
bit
more
if
it
had
a
thicker
mouthfeel
reminded
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
the
6
2
abv
is
well
hidden
definitely
a
beer
that
you
have
have
a
session
with
on
a
cold
evening
first
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
the
sweetness
that
i
detected
in
the
nose
does
not
translate
to
the
flavor
it
is
actually
fairly
dry
there
is
a
faint
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
but
this
is
a
onenote
thin
crystal
malt
beer
overall
pretty
average
d
very
drinkable
for
a
cold
winters
night
pours
an
opaque
semimurky
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
that
has
fairly
low
retention
medium
lacing
is
left
as
i
drink
this
one
down
smell
and
taste
have
a
roasty
element
some
sweets
nice
ripe
fruits
a
scotch
ale
like
malty
taste
and
an
alcohol
pinch
the
nose
is
a
bit
weak
the
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
smells
and
tastes
like
cranberries
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
in
body
and
carbonation
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
a
tiny
amount
of
warming
is
present
and
is
nice
in
a
winter
ale
piney
hops
go
well
with
the
berries
drinkability
is
fine
good
taste
very
good
price
no
off
or
overpowering
flavors
nice
holiday
ale
the
flavor
has
a
really
good
balance
with
some
flavors
really
popping
out
like
a
slightly
smokey
and
honeysweet
malt
red
currents
ride
in
with
more
fruity
hop
notes
that
are
gentle
not
citric
with
a
nice
hop
complexity
in
the
finish
earthy
and
fruity
hops
nice
bitterness
with
major
flavor
a
medium
feel
keeps
it
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
not
crazy
like
some
others
from
this
style
pretty
good
stuff
for
the
holidaze
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
a
slow
drinking
beer
despite
the
thin
mouthfeel
but
overall
this
beer
provides
a
nice
feeling
on
a
damp
cool
evening
go
phils
t
medium
body
i
like
the
balance
of
hops
and
chocolate
malts
at
first
i
wanted
to
describe
it
as
a
lighter
porter
but
i
think
that
would
be
inaccurate
although
it
does
have
some
of
those
elements
but
in
the
end
i
felt
it
was
a
nice
and
easily
drinkable
beer
d
great
brew
i
guess
its
an
old
ale
but
i
thought
it
was
a
wintery
porter
if
that
makes
sense
probably
not
oh
well
filling
and
very
tasty
yumm
o
its
pretty
sharp
in
hop
bite
and
carbonation
and
a
bit
too
yeasty
however
it
still
has
a
nice
dark
malt
presence
that
makes
up
for
the
minor
detractors
a
good
beer
overall
big
thanks
to
reagan1984
for
tossing
this
in
on
a
recent
trade
an
aggressive
pour
yields
an
off
white
colored
head
about
12
thick
it
is
a
caramel
brown
colored
ale
there
are
some
very
sweet
nutty
smells
to
this
one
the
smell
is
strong
and
rather
enticing
really
a
nice
blend
of
malts
and
spices
as
well
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
as
it
rests
in
your
mouth
maybe
from
the
spices
this
leads
to
distinct
beer
that
may
do
best
standing
alone
not
too
aggressive
of
an
abv
but
still
a
slow
sipper
all
in
all
a
nice
old
ale
and
a
great
winter
offering
a
bit
more
subtle
in
flavor
and
body
than
some
old
ales
but
delicious
none
the
less
and
im
certainly
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
one
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
a
great
version
of
the
style
but
has
a
good
flavor
profile
a
manageable
abv
and
a
gentle
warming
make
this
a
nice
winter
ale
im
not
necessarily
a
fan
of
winter
ales
much
prefer
octoberfests
bocks
and
ipas
but
id
purchase
this
one
again
however
id
keep
my
nose
away
from
the
bottle
and
just
enjoy
the
product
in
the
glass
drinkability
is
good
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
hop
and
malt
but
nothing
incredibly
unique
to
the
taste
it
is
a
nice
session
beer
but
there
is
nothing
really
different
to
it
that
is
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
try
overall
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
impressive
after
a
few
sips
pours
numerous
shades
of
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
not
the
most
appealing
looking
beer
imo
sweet
and
savory
malt
in
the
nose
creamy
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
rich
with
hints
at
chocolate
and
a
long
smoked
malt
aftertaste
smooth
and
simple
and
just
rich
enough
in
body
one
hell
of
a
winter
ale
bready
on
the
tongue
pleasant
and
easydrinking
with
enough
bitterness
to
keep
you
interested
some
winter
spices
around
the
edges
but
mostly
a
straightforward
old
ale
a
solid
session
beer
for
sure
i
must
say
this
was
a
pretty
boringbland
beer
appearance
wise
was
decent
with
a
nice
light
brown
color
smell
was
faint
aromas
taste
was
very
watery
the
beer
was
smooth
but
lacked
any
good
hopsmalt
taste
to
it
this
made
it
drinkable
but
not
entirely
enjoyable
i
felt
if
it
had
a
bit
more
taste
to
back
up
the
consistency
of
it
this
could
have
been
a
pretty
good
beer
how
it
is
though
is
just
a
run
of
the
mill
winter
seasonal
nothing
to
see
here
overall
a
very
decent
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
but
kinda
reminds
me
of
bread
you
left
in
the
toaster
a
bit
too
long
you
can
consume
it
but
not
quite
the
ideal
worth
a
try
find
a
single
d
notes
this
is
pretty
good
meets
the
character
points
for
the
style
a
good
sipping
beer
drinkability
nice
beer
to
relax
and
drink
easy
drinking
beer
very
tastey
winter
ale
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
that
comes
close
to
impressing
without
quite
doing
so
i
dont
often
say
this
but
fewer
hops
would
probably
move
things
in
a
positive
direction
thanks
to
fo5s
for
the
quality
extra
dark
red
amber
with
a
big
light
tan
head
and
good
lace
aroma
of
grapefruit
cinnamon
and
butterscotch
its
nice
and
creamy
with
some
smoke
and
malt
a
bit
peppery
but
a
sweet
toffee
maybe
butterscotch
flavor
weak
citrus
its
very
drinkable
with
mild
carbonation
for
a
decent
mouthfeel
a
new
personal
favorite
from
an
old
favorite
brewery
drinkability
this
is
highly
drinkable
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
winter
warmer
as
it
is
right
now
under
40f
here
in
connecticut
i
could
even
have
a
few
of
these
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
this
is
a
good
winter
seasonal
but
seems
a
lot
like
a
brown
ale
to
me
nonetheless
its
a
good
beer
that
i
could
stick
with
for
an
evening
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
dark
red
color
with
a
foamy
head
the
head
disappeared
quickly
but
had
lacing
that
lasted
until
after
the
beer
was
gone
aroma
was
minimal
some
spicyness
with
hints
of
hops
i
was
unable
to
place
the
spices
in
the
aroma
and
the
same
carried
over
to
the
flavor
i
couldnt
place
the
spices
and
it
had
a
touch
of
bitterness
however
the
full
flavor
that
i
tend
to
find
in
a
winter
just
wasnt
there
seemed
watery
in
my
mouth
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
drink
this
again
given
an
opportunity
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
without
any
dramatic
flaws
there
is
a
nice
complexity
particularly
in
the
differences
between
the
smell
and
the
taste
pours
a
cloudy
dark
mahogony
winelike
color
with
a
small
dirty
white
head
an
ok
looking
beerbut
nothing
great
the
smell
is
pretty
pungent
with
a
yeast
bisquity
aroma
thats
like
walking
into
a
bakery
there
are
some
spice
scentsbut
not
as
much
as
other
winters
the
taste
has
a
hop
bitterness
to
it
with
a
slightly
creamy
yeast
and
christmas
spice
flavor
the
bitterness
is
too
overpowering
for
the
other
flavors
to
come
out
making
this
an
ok
winter
beerbut
there
are
others
that
are
much
better
i
really
thought
this
would
be
better
it
was
inevitable
ipswich
is
one
of
my
favorite
brands
but
this
offering
was
extremely
disappointing
it
poured
a
murky
brown
with
a
little
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
was
musty
like
wet
socks
some
light
malt
presence
tatse
was
initially
malty
but
morphed
to
harsh
hops
at
mid
palate
not
overly
pleasant
mouthfeel
was
dry
to
a
fault
this
offering
had
a
distinct
catch
on
the
back
palate
is
this
really
an
ipswich
like
most
of
the
ipswich
beers
this
rocks
it
may
not
blow
your
socks
off
but
it
is
flavorful
drinkable
and
hearty
makes
me
feel
all
manly
quite
a
relaxing
brew
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
everyday
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
this
one
pours
a
dark
maroon
with
a
half
finger
head
has
a
bunch
of
sediment
floating
which
i
thought
was
interesting
smells
of
malts
hops
and
spices
as
you
put
your
nose
in
the
glass
tastes
of
malts
and
hops
also
but
a
bit
of
spicyness
that
follows
and
a
tad
of
bitterness
to
the
end
mouthfeel
is
goodgoes
down
smooth
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
while
sitting
by
the
fire
on
a
winters
day
i
was
pleasently
suprised
that
it
wasnt
like
harpoons
winter
warmer
considering
that
thats
the
only
winter
ale
ive
had
before
for
a
winter
ale
i
couldnt
detect
any
spices
typical
for
the
style
however
for
a
red
ale
i
found
it
well
balanced
and
very
flavorfull
the
bitterness
took
a
bit
away
from
its
drinkability
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
it
was
a
dep
brown
color
with
a
very
light
cream
colored
head
there
is
a
very
distinct
sheet
of
lace
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
i
drink
the
beer
the
aroma
has
some
spice
up
front
along
with
just
a
slight
citrus
aroma
lent
by
the
yeast
the
spice
seems
to
be
cinnamon
and
some
ginger
the
hops
im
afraid
i
cant
distinguish
the
flavor
has
a
very
spice
forward
profile
that
doesnt
forget
the
malt
there
is
a
sweetness
from
the
malt
that
carries
through
the
entire
drink
hops
come
during
the
middle
and
he
finish
of
the
drink
just
a
light
bit
of
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
tang
there
are
a
huge
amount
of
winter
warmers
to
try
to
compare
this
to
in
this
list
i
prefer
those
based
on
a
hoppy
beer
rather
than
a
brown
ale
this
is
definitely
based
on
a
brown
ale
with
just
some
spice
included
none
the
less
this
is
a
good
beer
that
shows
promise
this
is
a
hoppy
style
winter
seasonal
offering
from
ipswich
i
like
this
beer
and
it
can
be
added
to
one
of
many
many
great
winter
seasonals
that
i
will
be
enjoying
over
the
next
several
months
im
curious
to
find
out
what
the
abv
is
on
this
beer
hazy
tawnygold
it
is
a
lovely
color
and
much
lighter
then
i
was
expecting
a
white
head
of
a
finger
in
height
formed
nicely
the
head
retention
was
very
good
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
but
organized
nice
the
nose
is
surprisingly
citrusy
acidic
orangey
toasty
grain
wheat
bread
earthy
and
yeasty
the
arrangement
is
solid
i
found
it
inviting
but
by
smelling
it
i
dont
think
i
would
have
blindly
called
this
an
old
ale
then
again
maybe
it
is
not
one
ill
stop
thinking
and
start
drinking
the
aromas
are
inviting
above
average
potency
the
palate
is
flavorful
this
is
both
a
curse
and
a
blessing
the
hops
are
a
little
wacky
for
me
very
earthy
grassy
fruity
and
a
little
dirty
i
wonder
if
they
use
fuggles
or
willamette
or
something
similar
the
fruitiness
becomes
zippy
and
it
is
surprisingly
acidic
interesting
the
maltiness
is
very
small
especially
for
a
winter
warmerold
ale
and
it
gets
drowned
out
by
the
fruity
and
earthy
flavors
the
bitterness
is
solid
very
firm
actually
i
like
how
it
bites
it
is
very
easy
too
drink
refreshing
too
i
wonder
what
the
abv
is
mediummediumfull
in
body
modest
and
natural
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
this
is
an
interesting
beer
regardless
of
classification
i
found
it
unique
and
tasty
thank
you
drweizen
for
the
bottle
in
the
bif
5
package
thanks
beerresearcher
drainkability
is
good
and
im
sure
its
really
a
strong
ale
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
low
beige
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
a
bit
lemony
with
some
grassy
hops
but
it
is
very
faint
with
no
malt
presence
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
the
initial
flavor
is
yeasty
followed
by
some
cocoa
and
spice
and
then
a
hop
presence
rises
up
through
the
finish
strong
sitrus
and
peppery
spice
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
not
what
i
expected
for
a
winter
brew
this
is
the
second
winter
ale
ive
had
recently
that
more
resembles
a
paipa
than
a
traditional
winter
brew
the
taste
on
this
is
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
body
is
medium
with
some
noticeable
carbonation
a
bit
of
orange
citrus
in
the
middle
nice
little
hop
twang
at
the
end
pours
a
cloudy
orangycopperbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
rather
promptly
malty
aroma
but
nothing
particularly
outstanding
some
hop
aromas
in
the
mix
too
maybe
im
sampling
a
bit
too
cold
but
its
hard
to
pick
up
any
aroma
other
than
some
biscuity
sweet
malt
notes
and
a
bit
of
hops
tastes
malty
and
lowalpha
hoppy
too
a
nice
balance
sweetened
iced
tea
flavor
in
there
tastes
more
like
a
maltier
ipa
than
a
winter
ale
couldnt
pick
up
on
any
spice
or
offthecuff
ingredients
winter
seasonals
tend
to
have
overall
a
quality
brew
just
not
maybe
what
id
expected
the
flavor
wasnt
very
pleasant
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
gradually
and
i
start
enjoying
it
about
13
into
the
glass
interesting
and
complex
but
not
my
favorite
hop
blend
ipswich
makes
way
better
beer
than
this
maybe
an
off
batch
notes
this
beer
is
great
right
up
unitl
the
yeast
flavour
kicks
in
all
i
can
taste
is
yeast
no
matter
how
careful
i
pour
it
and
make
sure
the
sediment
stays
on
the
bottom
the
yeast
character
is
there
it
pours
a
cloudy
honey
amber
with
a
fast
fading
offwhite
head
a
big
whiff
of
fresh
hops
followed
by
sweet
malt
fades
in
a
matter
of
seconds
not
as
malty
as
many
winter
brews
but
slightly
maltier
than
pale
ales
lightly
sweet
caramel
and
biscuity
highly
hopped
with
a
sharp
edged
citrus
bitterness
and
slight
metallic
bite
a
lightly
fruity
and
orange
zest
taste
is
revealed
as
the
glass
warms
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
finishes
taste
oddly
this
is
quite
highly
hopped
the
hops
are
very
green
and
it
reminds
me
of
biting
into
a
kudzu
vine
body
is
thin
and
its
almost
unpleasantly
drying
at
the
end
very
little
malt
character
certainly
not
their
best
offering
taste
has
a
surprisingly
bitter
hoppy
bite
almost
immediately
followed
quickly
by
some
very
sweet
malt
fruity
yeasty
flavors
dancing
around
in
there
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
smooth
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
something
is
missing
i
like
how
bold
they
are
trying
to
be
with
this
beer
they
have
really
made
a
winter
brew
worthy
of
the
style
but
something
here
misses
a
bit
and
keeps
it
from
being
great
in
my
book
thanks
to
purplehops
for
the
bottles
this
beer
is
crazy
carbinated
ive
never
had
a
beer
with
so
much
carbination
before
it
tastes
ok
not
as
good
as
other
winter
ales
ive
had
tremont
comes
to
mind
the
carbination
is
the
real
sticker
for
me
though
i
burp
for
hours
after
having
one
of
these
i
had
the
last
bottle
of
the
six
pack
in
the
fridge
for
months
just
because
i
didnt
want
to
go
through
it
but
here
i
am
again
id
concider
ordering
this
beer
on
tap
but
whatever
happened
to
it
on
route
to
bottle
was
a
bad
bad
zuddzie
thing
take
out
even
a
small
amount
of
the
bubbles
and
id
dig
it
it
poured
to
give
an
amberbrown
beer
with
modest
foam
the
aroma
was
very
slight
malt
the
taste
was
of
malt
and
musty
grapes
but
was
thin
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
but
a
bit
chalky
the
drinkability
was
ok
i
was
not
too
impressed
perhaps
i
sampled
an
off
bottle
an
excellent
winter
ale
tastes
much
like
their
original
ale
though
thats
not
a
bad
thing
mind
you
but
i
expected
something
much
more
different
hops
are
a
bit
more
spicyslighty
richer
malt
look
clear
dark
amber
creamy
head
and
plenty
of
yeast
chunks
so
thats
never
appetizing
but
it
is
probably
bottle
conditioned
smell
minerallight
caramel
malt
ripe
stone
fruit
taste
sweet
almost
cloying
plummyspicy
malty
but
not
grainy
bitter
toffee
and
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
feel
medium
high
body
good
carbonation
low
astringency
overall
a
solid
old
ale
too
much
of
the
alcohol
and
it
becomes
a
distraction
from
the
other
flavors
lovely
creamy
carbonation
and
rich
body
o
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
but
nothing
i
could
drink
too
much
of
stronger
chocolate
presence
than
i
expected
overall
admittedly
i
am
surprised
i
have
had
several
eel
river
brews
ravens
eye
is
my
favorite
this
is
second
i
am
going
to
pick
up
at
least
another
bottle
to
age
this
is
a
beer
that
is
well
balanced
the
sweetness
though
prevalent
does
not
overwhelm
the
malt
and
bitterness
taste
hot
sake
and
carmel
cheap
vodka
on
the
tongue
with
a
malt
foundation
poured
from
bomber
650
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
the
flavor
comes
across
a
little
dramatic
i
would
love
to
have
this
same
beer
dialed
back
about
twenty
five
percent
in
both
the
bitterness
and
the
alcohol
80
ibus
seems
to
be
a
bit
much
here
the
aroma
is
incredibly
inviting
but
once
it
hit
my
mouth
it
became
a
little
obnoxious
but
in
the
end
i
am
impressed
3
755
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
minimal
quickly
dissipating
head
looking
a
bit
like
a
whiskey
in
the
glass
a
bit
more
like
a
whiskey
or
brandywine
especially
when
the
minimal
carbonation
stilled
it
is
really
only
the
malty
bready
richness
smooth
on
the
tongue
which
reminds
the
drinker
that
this
is
still
a
beer
a
fine
sipping
beer
for
me
but
hard
hitting
and
not
very
subtle
in
character
perhaps
some
dried
fruit
notes
molasses
sweetness
but
not
true
esthers
as
in
a
barleywine
and
a
slightly
metallic
alcohol
edge
although
the
creaminess
covers
this
not
bad
but
a
little
too
direct
for
me
lol
overall
solid
beer
its
a
big
old
ale
a
well
made
and
almost
classic
example
of
the
style
something
i
always
enjoy
when
i
have
it
and
always
wonder
why
i
dont
order
it
more
often
pours
the
darkest
copper

with
creamiest
three

and
finished
with
a
roasted

and

bittersweetness
and
overall
a
nice

ale
that
would
age
well
cheers
glad
i
tried
t
would
definitely
drink
again
but
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
although
it
is
still
not
a
mind
blower
in
the
old
ale
spectrum
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
alcohol
heavy
preventing
complete
enjoymentsavoring
the
flavor
profile
is
good
but
lacks
the
true
greatness
of
say
kuhnhenn
4d
the
beer
was
dark
brown
in
color
hazy
that
produced
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
dark
fruits
alcohol
and
maybe
brown
sugar
for
that
hint
of
sweetness
the
beer
was
pretty
malty
sweet
with
that
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
but
the
taste
was
certainly
big
as
others
have
noted
the
beer
felt
more
like
a
barleywine
very
heavy
overall
i
got
to
say
that
i
am
not
into
the
darker
beers
with
the
dark
fruit
flavors
but
the
beer
was
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
doubt
i
would
drink
it
again
d
pretty
easily
drinkable
for
a
near
10
beer
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
drinking
this
makes
me
wonder
why
organic
beer
can
be
so
good
and
so
many
organic
foods
can
be
so
bland
o
this
beer
really
tastes
similar
to
an
american
barleywine
because
it
is
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
it
would
have
been
nicer
if
the
alcohol
was
better
masked
from
the
smell
and
taste
o
a
nice
beer
it
is
interesting
how
the
palate
differs
from
the
nose
offering
something
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brick
red
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
sweet
i
get
some
molasses
notes
as
well
as
some
dark
fruit
there
is
also
some
sherry
alcohol
and
caramel
malt
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
full
of
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
mainly
cherries
grapes
dates
and
raisins
there
is
also
a
strong
sweet
malt
backbone
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
resinous
pine
a
big
flavorful
and
alcoholic
american
barleywine
that
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
i
wish
it
came
in
a
12
ounce
bottle
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
its
a
strong
manly
beer
theres
just
not
getting
away
from
it
for
the
most
part
its
an
easy
sipper
definitely
something
you
sip
its
just
very
strong
and
aggressive
it
never
crosses
the
line
but
it
stands
defiantly
on
the
line
ive
got
about
19
more
ounces
to
go
from
the
bomber
i
bought
and
ill
surely
be
sleeping
well
tonight
pours
a
medium
brown
with
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
longer
than
i
was
expecting
mega
caramel
molasses
character
to
the
nose
and
taste
really
sticky
sweet
not
particularly
a
fan
of
the
stickiness
but
it
comes
with
the
flavor
more
or
less
other
old
ales
ive
tried
most
notably
curmudgeon
have
been
a
little
lighter
in
color
and
texture
i
prefer
the
style
that
way
it
was
nice
to
try
in
any
case
the
old
ale
is
kind
of
underappreciated
review
from
12010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
orange
brown
amber
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
bready
and
caramel
malt
earthy
with
some
nuttiness
flavor
is
understated
nutty
caramel
malt
up
front
with
a
big
hit
of
alcohol
and
hops
interesting
spicy
wood
flavor
middle
and
hop
finish
nice
job
the
alcohol
is
a
little
hot
but
the
flavor
progression
is
good
and
malty
a
nice
old
ale
rjt
overall
an
amazing
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
nothing
to
really
keep
me
interested
here
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
and
really
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
of
it
the
look
is
outstanding
but
the
overall
beer
lacks
real
character
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
the
head
retains
relatively
well
sticky
foam
laces
the
glass
as
the
head
attenuates
butterscotch
cream
up
front
the
mouthfeel
accentuates
the
finish
which
is
a
little
to
bitter
for
this
style
the
alcohol
warmth
that
appears
at
the
end
further
exacerbates
the
unappealing
finish
pours
a
lightly
clouded
brown
color
with
big
frothy
khaki
head
little
retention
scent
leads
with
nice
notes
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
roasted
nuts
hint
of
dark
fruit
booze
taste
leads
with
a
little
bit
of
booze
which
is
my
only
knock
with
flavor
eases
into
nice
notes
of
vanilla
booze
soaked
cherry
brown
sugar
and
faint
splash
of
oak
medium
bodied
a
touch
light
for
the
style
a
decent
old
ale
that
opens
up
and
becomes
better
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
overall
ive
had
this
before
and
was
not
impressed
a
little
age
has
served
this
brew
so
very
well
drinks
quite
beautifully
considering
the
strength
superb
taste
overall
quite
a
tasty
brew
theres
a
pretty
big
alcohol
bite
along
with
the
strong
bitterness
toward
the
end
so
its
not
hugely
drinkable
per
se
still
a
good
sipper
on
this
a
cold
snowy
day
overall
i
personally
think
this
is
a
great
old
ale
great
depths
of
flavor
just
delicious
very
much
a
high
alcohol
barleywine
reminiscient
of
bigfoot
under
the
old
ale
title
this
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
your
standard
old
ale
dark
ruby
body
with
a
thicket
of
khaki
tan
head
this
thing
pours
pretty
viscous
for
the
color
aroma
has
big
earthy
piney
notes
with
big
ripened
fruits
plums
raisins
and
tart
apples
malt
sweetness
is
layered
between
caramelized
sugars
and
toasted
malts
with
interwoven
layers
of
big
ripened
fruit
more
raisin
plums
you
could
definitely
lay
this
big
bruiser
down
and
not
worry
about
its
aging
potential
you
know
this
thing
is
going
to
get
better
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
a
bit
tamer
with
hop
bitterness
than
your
average
bigfoot
release
finishes
balanced
between
hops
and
big
malts
moderate
carbonation
carries
things
extremely
well
doesnt
become
cloying
or
harsh
despite
the
big
malthop
action
going
on
highly
excited
to
try
this
beer
much
better
than
any
other
organic
offering
ive
come
across
o
average
poured
into
a
20
oz
giant
duvel
tulip
pours
a
lovely
bright
reddish
orange
with
a
3
inch
off
white
head
that
settles
slowly
into
a
layer
of
bubbles
bountiful
lace
nice
smell
is
carmel
toffee
brown
sugar
bread
dark
fruit
raisinsfigs
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
all
of
those
flavors
dominated
by
carmel
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
body
is
on
the
larger
side
nice
carbonation
not
too
dry
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
its
sturdy
abv
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
being
a
hop
head
but
i
think
this
is
a
nice
old
ale
thanks
mom
for
the
early
christmas
present
overall
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
it
might
improve
with
time
i
liked
it
well
enough
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
have
been
glad
to
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
have
get
it
if
you
see
it
the
downside
not
much
in
the
finesse
side
huge
sweetness
huge
bitterness
huge
alcohol
not
much
attempt
to
blend
them
together
they
would
use
a
bulldozer
to
find
a
china
cup
raiders
of
the
lost
ark
im
gonna
say
this
rates
just
slightly
below
middle
of
the
road
potent
does
pack
a
punch
guess
that
i
have
no
idea
regarding
old
ale
d
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
i
am
not
looking
for
a
sessionable
beer
when
drinking
old
ale
but
you
should
want
to
finish
the
glass
not
this
time
overall
a
decent
in
not
special
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
this
is
a
style
i
usually
shy
away
from
but
if
i
ever
see
this
on
a
shelf
ill
by
another
one
overall
abv
saves
the
beer
it
does
pack
a
punch
and
is
a
decent
overall
but
eel
river
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
they
are
a
good
decent
brewery
with
their
heart
in
the
right
place
this
beer
is
a
slightly
better
one
of
theirs
fullbodied
with
a
sharp
initial
effervescence
that
drops
in
the
middle
a
dryness
in
the
finish
but
relatively
rich
at
the
fore
and
continuing
throughout
nicely
warming
from
the
getgo
a
bit
more
nose
and
flavor
would
really
make
this
a
great
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
to
dry
candy
sugar
in
the
taste
dry
fruit
candy
sugar
and
a
small
yeasty
presence
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
ok
but
average
d
easy
to
drink
but
old
ales
arent
session
beers
drinkability
is
average
for
the
style
glassware
tulip
smooth
and
thick
and
mellow
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
my
first
experience
with
eel
river
i
think
i
will
pick
up
a
couple
more
of
their
brews
this
is
a
bold
beer
and
proves
that
organic
beer
can
be
great
in
the
right
brewers
hands
i
dont
know
about
eel
rivers
other
stuff
this
is
my
first
but
i
like
what
theyve
got
going
on
here
probably
a
little
demanding
for
a
higher
drinkability
rating
but
yeah
this
is
definitely
recommended
overall
not
that
complex
but
it
has
a
good
clean
flavor
drinks
very
well
is
very
well
balanced
and
for
a
sweet
brew
it
really
has
enough
other
balanced
flavors
to
make
it
not
seem
so
much
like
a
malt
power
punch
to
the
gut
great
brew
downtown
wine
and
spirits
in
somerville
ma
overall
i
find
the
beer
to
be
overly
sweet
and
rough
around
the
edges
this
was
not
undrinkable
but
it
was
not
very
good
definitely
a
sipping
brew
and
quite
good
to
be
sure
although
i
still
would
prefer
some
old
stock
over
this
one
d
this
is
an
uneven
beer
but
still
oddly
drinkable
perhaps
it
was
the
name
that
got
my
hopes
up
but
ive
tasted
much
better
brews
from
the
folks
at
eel
river
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
to
let
this
one
age
a
year
a
burning
question
persists
does
an
old
ale
crammed
full
of
hops
and
thus
resembling
a
different
style
get
to
call
itself
an
old
ale
pours
a
really
deep
amberruby
color
with
a
short
but
sticky
offwhite
head
smell
is
really
sweet
and
dominated
by
dark
dried
fruits
mostly
fig
and
caramel
despite
the
sweet
and
malty
aroma
the
taste
has
a
good
bit
of
hoppiness
to
it
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
definitely
not
the
sweet
malt
bomb
that
the
scent
suggested
the
fig
appears
on
the
tongue
as
well
along
with
plums
toffee
and
a
hint
of
coffee
you
also
get
a
molasses
that
seems
to
appear
after
a
few
swallows
rich
and
creamy
feel
this
goes
down
very
nice
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
offering
d
while
this
beer
does
not
offend
the
palateit
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
a
big
beerit
lacks
the
subtle
complexities
and
refined
character
that
should
be
present
in
an
englishstyle
strong
ale
i
would
look
for
an
opportunity
in
the
future
to
taste
this
beer
with
some
age
on
it
for
the
sake
of
comparison
but
im
not
rushing
to
add
a
bottle
to
my
own
collection
not
surprisingly
there
are
some
similarities
to
north
coast
old
stock
although
this
beer
still
seems
to
have
the
training
wheels
attached
d
this
is
a
very
nice
old
ale
a
really
good
brew
from
eel
river
22oz
bottle
s
the
aroma
is
malty
with
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
alcohol
d
overall
triple
exultation
is
a
pretty
solid
old
ale
at
9
7
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
worth
a
try
d
this
is
very
tasty
but
watch
out
for
the
abv
easy
to
polish
off
a
bomber
an
old
ale
that
goes
up
to
100
ibus
thats
crazy
eel
river
manages
to
pull
it
off
without
creating
a
mess
very
pretty
dark
ruby
colour
it
smelled
strongly
of
bourbonliquor
but
it
didnt
have
too
much
of
a
kick
to
it
it
was
very
sweet
and
pruney
slightly
like
raisins
it
was
very
smooth
and
very
tasty
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
high
in
the
abv
to
have
too
much
drinkability
worth
trying
no
real
issues
for
me
but
not
distinctive
enough
to
take
note
flavor
is
much
nicer
than
the
nose
led
on
has
a
rich
almost
puddingesque
sweetness
and
thickness
some
oxidized
malts
are
present
but
it
has
held
up
pretty
well
for
being
3
years
old
has
a
toasty
and
mild
hop
finish
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
and
is
in
the
forefront
and
on
the
back
end
of
tasting
it
does
have
a
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
and
some
pretty
nice
flavors
going
on
vanilla
and
maybe
even
some
bourbon
characteristics
come
out
as
it
warms
some
nutty
malts
are
there
as
well
pretty
smooth
i
like
it
albeit
a
somewhat
simplistic
old
ale
interesting
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
this
was
worth
the
money
but
it
definitely
wont
be
a
regular
purchase
i
might
pick
up
one
bottle
once
winter
rolls
around
again
but
overall
id
much
sooner
grab
a
4pack
of
north
coasts
old
stock
ale
first
off
the
head
was
so
much
better
i
dont
know
that
this
had
anything
to
do
with
cellaring
but
it
was
thick
creamy
and
left
globs
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
still
tight
but
the
flavors
opened
up
a
lot
more
especially
the
sugars
overall
a
huge
improvement
and
will
even
get
better
over
the
next
six
to
twelve
months
drinkability
deceptively
easy
the
body
is
really
light
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
alcohol
is
felt
although
not
overly
hot
overall
a
nice
beer
the
aroma
was
awesome
but
it
went
a
little
downhill
from
there
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
although
the
old
stock
ale
by
north
coast
may
be
my
favorite
in
this
area
a
solid
second
though
d
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
really
like
this
beer
man
what
a
step
up
from
the
amber
which
was
not
good
at
all
surprised
that
the
two
beers
are
even
made
by
the
same
brewery
i
would
put
this
one
up
with
hibernation
maybe
not
as
balanced
as
hibernation
but
man
it
has
a
great
flavor
if
you
like
ole
ales
i
highly
recommend
this
one
i
bet
it
would
be
killer
in
a
year
a
quite
nice
old
ale
while
i
generally
prefer
this
style
to
be
a
bit
heavier
and
slower
drinking
they
did
a
nice
job
here
some
hints
of
a
barleywine
here
too
an
enjoyable
drink
not
quite
what
i
was
gearing
up
for
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
good
stuff
nonetheless
makes
me
interested
in
other
offerings
from
eel
river
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
an
amberbrown
color
that
is
fairly
opaque
there
was
a
bit
of
a
frothy
dark
tan
head
on
it
but
it
dropped
away
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
interesting
aroma
spicy
woody
some
alcohol
on
top
caramel
malts
begin
to
punch
through
rather
quickly
interesting
taste
definitely
some
alcohol
up
front
it
subsides
quickly
and
is
followed
by
smoky
woody
caramel
some
roasted
flavors
and
spices
also
wasnt
sure
i
liked
it
on
the
first
sip
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
more
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
i
liked
the
smell
and
flavor
a
bit
triple
exultation
is
a
good
beer
i
think
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
thing
9
times
out
of
10
id
opt
for
great
divide
hibernation
ale
which
has
a
better
mouthfeel
and
for
me
a
better
taste
1
time
out
of
10
though
id
take
this
somewhat
more
complex
but
less
refined
old
ale
d
an
interesting
beer
that
really
blends
some
of
the
sweeter
toffee
malt
flavors
with
some
of
the
sweeter
and
bitter
sides
of
the
hop
worth
a
try
i
would
recommend
this
one
only
to
beer
fans
looking
to
try
new
beers
but
there
are
others
out
there
that
might
be
better
choices
eel
river
triple
exultation
pours
a
bare
finger
of
foam
over
a
cinnamoncolored
brew
that
collapses
to
a
ring
of
bubbles
pretty
quickly
that
ring
is
maintained
by
a
very
spritzy
carbonation
the
nose
is
clean
toasted
malts
herbal
hops
and
notes
of
butterscotch
the
flavor
is
pretty
straightforward
sweetish
rummy
malt
with
molasses
notes
stiffened
up
by
grassyherbal
malts
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
sharpness
mouthfeel
is
round
and
clean
trending
dry
due
to
the
sharp
hoppy
aftertaste
pretty
decent
though
i
feel
its
a
tad
hoppy
for
the
style
i
was
a
little
surprised
visiting
their
website
that
they
claim
its
100
ibus
i
must
have
gotten
a
pretty
fresh
bottle
of
the
stuff
a
little
aging
would
take
the
edge
off
nicely
and
at
9
7
abv
you
can
let
it
sit
for
a
while
worth
a
try
and
one
of
the
few
100
usda
organic
breweries
out
there
i
thought
this
was
a
very
tasty
old
ale
not
quite
to
style
but
very
tasty
d
im
not
going
to
run
out
to
the
store
and
gush
over
this
but
i
found
it
enjoyable
and
i
will
pick
it
up
again
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
and
its
organic
to
boot
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
good
tan
head
it
smelled
like
honey
wheat
and
caramel
with
some
spicy
yeast
and
molasses
it
tasted
like
a
mix
of
spiced
breads
such
as
rye
pumpernickel
sourdough
and
fresh
wheat
along
with
some
caramel
and
honey
and
copper
hops
it
was
fairly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
overall
this
didnt
taste
like
i
expected
with
a
lot
more
spice
and
hops
and
a
lot
less
malty
sweetness
it
still
tasted
clean
and
was
enjoyable
and
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
nice
if
age
would
provide
a
more
prominent
maltiness
but
i
think
there
is
an
equal
chance
the
flavor
would
simply
ending
up
fading
over
the
years
who
knows
while
fresh
this
is
a
good
and
interesting
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
old
ale
nice
nd
of
the
night
beer
not
much
hop
feel
but
a

very
pleasing

not

full
hearty
and
robust
with

good

though
nothing
overwhelms

this
is
a
really
great
quaff
overall
a
good
beer
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
into
a
nonic
imperial

this
old

crimson

color

an
inch
of
foamy
head
nose
and
flavor
are
of
dark
fruits
such
as
cherries
and
prunes
dark
brown
sugar
quite
sweet
slight
citrus
note
as
it
warms
and
a
noticeable
dose
of
alcohol
just
above
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
for
its
style
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
probably
good
with
some
bbq
or
flavorful
meats
maybe
even
a
roasted
chicken
my
initial
tasting
of
this
beer
was
a
big
zero
this
second
tasting
warrants
the
review
and
im
glad
i
went
back

very
well
done
with
enough
complexities
but
also
keeping
a
nice
drinkable
profile
d
if
it
didnt
turn
slick
id
give
it
a
higher
score
but
im
not
sure
how
often
i
could
drink
this
one
clear
mix
of
ruby
and
amber
colors
very
quick
head
ok
bubbling
and
no
lacing
or
stickage
the
aroma
is
an
even
blend
of
spicy
orange
hops
and
sweet
toasted
bread
mlts
too
much
hops
in
the
aroma
of
this
old
ale
the
taste
starts
with
mildly
sweet
almost
candy
like
toasted
bread
malts
the
spicy
somehwat
peppery
and
definetly
orange
peel
hops
this
beer
is
balance
but
not
enough
of
the
malt
is
allowed
to
shine
through
i
like
old
ales
for
their
maltiness
this
palate
is
a
touch
to
spicy

a
pretty
good
beer
from
a
brewery
i
know
nothing
about
overall
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
one
note
many
stronger
beers
get
better
as
they
warm
but
this
one
had
the
opposite
effect
for
me
its
a
good
brew
recommended
for
sure
d
this
one
was
a
let
down
for
me
not
one
i
would
grab
another
one
of
for
a
long
time
maybe
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
the
malts
will
come
out
more
and
make
this
alot
more
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
ill
check
back
in
23
years
d
i
asked
the
owner
to
make
sure
this
one
stays
on
tap
classic
example
of
an
old

bier
style
exceptional
beer
ill
skip
this
one
next
time
i
am
almost
certain
that
i
have
an
old
bottle
if
i
buy
another
of
this
i
will
have
to
compare
that
taste
session
with
this
one
as
it
is
if
this
is
the
aged
version
i
like
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
robust
american
style
olde
ale
pretty
smooth
tasty
decent
depth
the
strength
is
pretty
overt
but
ive
got
another
one
that
should
easily
be
able
to
run
23
more
years
at
least
at
9
7
abv
and
fairly
easy
to
notice
not
that
its
overpowering
this
is
one
that
most
people
wont
be
slamming
down
by
the
case
i
like
it
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
just
probably
not
more
than
one
per
session
not
bad
not
outstanding

before
taxcrv
would
like
to
revisit
this
beer
once
it
has
at
least
a
year
on
it
dok
drinkability
i
remember
when
i
purchased
this
bottle
the
salesman
at
heritage
commented
about
how
this
brew
was
different
than
so
many
other
old
ales
in
that
it
had
a
huge
hop
presence
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
interpretation
of
the
style
and
id
definately
enjoy
this
one
again
nice
solid
offwhite
one
finger
head
of
mixed
bubble
sizes
nothing
dramatic
about
it
steady
presence
with
good
lacing
deep
murkiness
to
the
redbrown
clay
color
complete
opacity
an
orange
aura
sneaks

around

of
scotch
whiskey
molten
caramel
butterscotch

coated
raisins
ginger
cookies
barley

not
crisp
enough
to
seem
toasted
but
its
all
malt
and
no
hops
fullbodied
more
of
that
alcoholic
rum
or
whiskey
action
no
burn
but
heady
to
say
the
least
caramel
toffee
molasses
all
the
standard
descriptors
oats
and
barley
mulled
prune
juice
dates
milk
chocolate
orange
juice
the
carbonation
makes
a
good
faith
effort
to
rev
things
up
but
ultimately
cant
so
better
just
relax
and
accept
the
steamroller
of
sweetness
flattening
your
tongue
the
hoppiness
does
not
truly
show
strength
except
as
aftertaste
its
flavorful
and
easily
gives
pleasure
but
its
kind
of
like
trying
to
eat
a
whole
fruitcake
yourself
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
astonishing
dark
amber
color
a
little
light
for
the
style
with
a
creamy
beige
head
nice
lacing
aromas
of
alcohol
fruity
esters
alcohol
caramel
and
fusel
alcohol
flavor

malty
with
a
thinnish
mouthfeel
solid

lots
of
booze
dark
and
red
fruits
and
a
burnt
character
high
carbonation
too
much
alcohol
not
very
drinkable
however
it
doesnt
have
a
bunch
of
absurd
offflavors
like
most
organic
beers
not
recommended
another
organic
bomb
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
no
head
reminiscent
of
rusty
water
ethyl
alcohol
caramel
and
the
smell
of
burnt
sugar
viscous
soilid
mouthfeel
has
me
looking
up
maybe
the
taste
will
redeem
this
one
nope
raisins
prunes
and
malt
doused
in
alcohol
and
molasses
this
is
like
one
of
those
nightmarish
christmas
homemade
candied
plums
boooo
take
you
triple
exultation
and
stick
it
in
a
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
before
drinking
it
d
i
have
been
hearing
about
this
brewery
for
a
while
now
not
bad
and
it
did
not
have
that
organic
commonality
so
many
organic
beers
have
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
and
i
think
it
might
benefit
with
some
time
but
it
is
enjoyable
now
as
the
beer
warms
up
some
hemp
like
aromatic
notes
start
to
become
noticeable
in
the
nose
the
flavor
too
becomes
a
bit
more
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hop
character
in
fact
the
hop
notes
get
quite
a
bit
more
aggressive
with
quite
a
sharp
herbal
edge
to
it
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
malt
picks
up
a
hint
of
roasty
character
as
it
warms
up
as
well
though
this
is
pretty
subtle
this
ends
up
being
a
nice
beer
to
be
drinking
in
the
colder
months
of
the
year
the
rich
malt
plays
the
leading
role
but
it
ends
up
being
nicely
balanced
out
by
a
biting
hop
character
despite
this
balance
the
beer
ends
up
not
as
well
integrated
as
i
would
prefer
not
bad
but
it
could
be
beer
perhaps
a
bit
of
age
might
help
with
this
flavor
is
sweet
malt
as
expected
brown
sugar
and
some
toffee
notes
with
a
bit
of
warming
booze
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
very
tasty
but
doesnt
mislead
you
into
drinking
too
many
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
will
be
purchasing
it
again
in
the
future
plus
it
is
certified
organic
bonus
pours
a
deep
clear
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
and
nice
belgian
lacing
the
flavor
is
of
rich
malt
with
a
very
apparant
alcohol
bite
aftertaste
the
aroma
is
a
light
roasted
coffee
or
maybe
even
a
sweeter
toffee

really
good
beer

warm

overall
though
in
terms
of
the
flavor
everything
seems
a
bit
muted
except
the
alcohol
im
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
which
is
a
shame
because
i
love
old
ales
and
their
incarnations
are
so
few
and
far
between
d
reasonably
drinkable
but
kind
of
a
weak
old
ale
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
really
falls

would

with
with
6

mellow
a

and
to

is
awesome
it
has
a

wish
i
could

here
id
like

a
touch

heat
from
the
alcohol
helps
the
sweet
dry
finish
the
rest
of
the
way
down
d
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
recommended
old
ale
the
aroma
was
of
chocolate
and
figs
i
could
taste
the
high
abv
right
away
and
it
had
an
aggressive
malt
and
hop
profile
that
blended
well
in
the
mouth
it
was
semichewy
that
left
a
burning
sensation
after
it
left
this
one
was
good
but
definitely
a
sipper
as
the
lips
were
burning
a

still
if
you

give
it
a
try

ok
drinkability
this
was
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
as
dbalsock
kind
of
downplayed
it
im
still
working
on
finishing
this
bomber
but
i
dont
foresee
any
problems
in
doing
that
brownish
colour
with
enormous
offwhite
head
that
was
bubbly
and
lacey
funkey
aroma
brandyish
taste
that
was
both
a
soft
caramel
mouthfeel
but
also
sourish
well
silly
me
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
triple
belgium
and
thought
it
was
of
in
fact
as
an
old
ale
well
yes
and
all
me
superbeer
geeks
did
not
also
get
it
so
i
dont
feel
so
bad
even
after
a
22
ounce
bottle
i
have
some
mixed
feelings
began
very
drinkable
but
didnt
sustain
enough
depth
and
balance
too
bitter
for
the
style
even
though
alcohol
is
noticeable
its
not
too
sharp
there
is
a
metallic
characteristic
going
on
still
theres
enough
to
it
to
make
it
be
fine
to
sip
on
a
22ouncer
i
dont
know
that
old
ale
would
have
come
to
mind
maybe
a
dipa
but
it
would
have
been
in
my
first
few
guesses
i
suppose
they
tried
to
add
a
hoppy
character
to
it
while
maintaining
sweetness
i
assume
works
well
enough
but
not
to
any
great
degree
imo
i
would
recommend
this
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
at
3

highly
recommended
i
expected
triple
exultation
to
be
at
least
as
good
as
ravens
eye
imperial
stout
a
beer
that
was
mucho
enjoyable
instead
its
about
the
same
level
of
quality
as
the
rest
of
eel
rivers
lineup
in
other
words
its
average
to
below
average
and
isnt
worthy
of
a
repeat
purchase
ozzy
deserves
to
be
compared
to
much
better
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
sugary
boozy
with
flowery
bitterness
in
the
finish
d
all
in
all
an
excellent
old
ale
the
smell
wrote
a
check
that
the
taste
couldnt
cash
but
it
still
ended
up
being
a
bit
better
than
average
pours
a
deep
clear
mahogany
brown
with
a
decent
big
bubbled
tan
head
and
better
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
coffee
malt
with
toffee
elements
warm
and
inviting
the
taste
is
a
malty
mouthful
with
a
certain
warming
alcohol
that
is
obvious
but
not
all
that
distracting
it
is
aqueous
but
it
shows
a
nice
viscosity
almost
resinous
plenty
of
maltiness
here
and
plenty
of
alcohol
this
sometimes
almost
seems
like
a
malt
liquor
not
colt
45like
but
a
liqeur
of
malt
theres
a
sweet
dr
pepper
quality
about
it
and
the
bitterness
is
pretty
steep
dry
and
perhaps
herbal
its
drinkability
is
probably
minimal
due
to
the
alcohol
presence
a
touch
roasty
and
hoppy
to
call
it
an
old
ale
in
my
book
with
about
a
year
or
so
of
age
on
it
this
is
coming
around
nicely
id
consider
throwing
a
case
in
the
basement
and
letting
a
few
years
elapse
to
enjoy
this
down
the
road
dvery
nice
not
sure
if
this
is
really
an
old
ale
or
a
malted
up
dipa
lots
of
malt
and
hops
keep
this
big
boy
going
a
nice
beer
and
my
fav
eel
river
brew
to
date
for
an
old
ale
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
tastewise
rich
thick
notes
of
caramel
candies
think
melted
sugar
daddy
balance
well
with
brown
sugars
raisin
plum
and
resinous
hops
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
and
the
body
is
smoothnot
exactly
creamybut
chewable
finish
is
sweet
caramels
and
some
pine
with
the
alcohol
note
very
well
masked
overall
triple
exultation
is
a
winner
just
like
eel
rivers
ravens
eye
imp
stout
theyre
2
for
2
in
my
book
id
definately
seek
this
out
again
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
rich
deep
amber
with
a
little
mahagony
tint
a
larger
creamy
off
white
head
atop
that
never
totally
subsideda
great
mix
of
citric
resiny
hop
and
malty
dark
fruit
and
caramel
in
the
nose
after
it
warms
a
little
a
light
sweet
acohol
note
shows
through
as
well
this
is
an
american
influenced
old
ale
no
doubt
on
the
palate
a
big
dose
of
piney
citric
hop
really
hits
up
front
with
some
sweetich
dark
fruit
and
a
even
a
little
nuttiness
in
there
as
well
just
well
balanced
the
alcohol
does
creep
a
little
and
you
do
feel
it
after
a
bit
started
out
a
little
prickly
in
the
mouth
but
it
subsided
after
awhilea
very
nice
sipping
brew
i
enjoyed
it
its
still
very
boozy
despite
being
clearly
warmer
its
got
some
good
flavors
in
there
i
can
tell
i
really
want
to
like
this
as
it
aspires
to
be
something
individual
it
commits
beer
suicide
by
trying
to
be
overly
imperial
probably
wont
try
it
again
paired
nicely
with
some
madrigal
cheese
dangerously
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
with
plenty
of
body
i
would
visit
this
one
again
d
a
great
dark
and
sipping
tripel
that
was
boozy
and
alcohol
fueled
halfway
through
the
drink
you
start
to
warm
up
to
it
and
becomes
much
easier
to
handle
and
enjoy
recommended
drinks
pretty
good
for
the
abv
style
the
hop
mix
isnt
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
a
solid
old
ale
all
in
all
drinkability
decent
overall
beer
worthy
of
a
try
slow
sipping
beer
but
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
well
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
look
upon
first
pour
is
picture
perfect
as
a
postcard
fine
color
with
a
substanial
beige
head
like
clouds
looming
overhead
the
head
disapates
a
bit
with
each
sip
but
leaving
an
almost
perfect
ring
of
lace
on
the
inner
surface
of
your
glass
there
is
a
real
sweetness
early
as
each
sip
rolls
over
your
tongue
i
get
a
real
taste
of
candi
sugar
that
come
to
a
quick
halt
taken
over
by
the
alcohol
burn
the
alcohol
while
not
harsh
or
an
off
flavor
but
is
pronounced
enough
for
me
to
quickly
think
about
laying
a
bottle
of
this
brew
down
my
bet
is
one
will
find
time
will
be
a
real
friend
to
this
beer
the
finish
is
balanced
by
a
west
coast
hop
finish
very
apparent
with
a
lasting
drying
out
effect
that
precedes
a
lingering
carmel
aftertaste
while
so
far
ive
found
some
ups
and
downs
with
ell
river
beers
all
will
be
revisited
to
confirm
my
taste
this
one
i
will
look
forward
to
with
much
antisapation
perhaps
2
to
3
years
down
the
road
from
that
aged
bottle
when
the
alcohol
and
hops
have
found
an
even
better
marriage
a
very
attractive
beer
clear
clean
rubyamber
with
a
strong
frothy
head
and
tons
of
lacing
notes
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
citrus
emerged
in
the
nose
the
flavor
included
lots
of
hops
in
this
one
and
much
of
it
right
up
front
notes
of
light
brown
sugar
prunes
and
some
coffee
made
appearances
very
bitter
on
the
back
end
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
less
malty
than
some
old
ales
ive
tried
but
i
liked
the
extra
hop
punch
overall
this
beer
was
not
as
complex
as
i
expected
but
i
bet
it
would
age
nicely
fantastic
looking
ale
the
colour
is
so
neat
its
darksmoky
brown
with
a
hint
of
purple
through
it
its
hard
to
describe
but
beautiful
lovelly
medium
sized
tan
head
aromas
of
dark
maltiness
prunes
figs
demerara
sugar
dark
70
chocolate
taste
is
thick
and
bitter
smooth
malts
toffee
extra
strong
black
coffee
pipe
tobacco
ashy
and
a
hint
of
marzipan
all
finished
off
by
noticable
yet
pleasing
alcohol
great
palate
on
this
one
i
relished
the
feel
of
every
sip
over
all
a
very
nice
ale
good
one
eel
river
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
off
white
head
which
disappates
slowly
great
lacing
the
smell
was
malty
sweetness
with
roasted
smells
as
well
the
taste
was
roasted
malt
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
with
medium
carbonation
with
strong
alcohol
taste
present
overall
great
beer
i
would
prefer
this
during
the
winter
months
this
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
malt
raison
and
molasses
characteristics
the
taste
is
malty
and
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
have
suggested
it
has
a
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
the
alcohol
definitely
noticeable
this
is
above
all
a
great
smelling
beer
the
flavors
do
not
follow
but
id
love
to
cellar
this
for
a
while
and
review
again
in
a
year
d
pretty
good
never
took
notes
on
a
fresh
bottle
tho
i
do
remember
rather
enjoying
it
so
i
cant
recall
if
the
astringcyblack
tea
which
i
find
a
little
off
is
a
result
of
ageoxidation
or
if
more
time
will
reduce
it
great
beer
im
ecstatic
that
i
haphazardly
chose
this
one
to
try
d
big
huge
brew
reminds
me
a
lot
of
hotd
adam
but
just
not
as
complex
this
too
would
be
a
very
nice
cigar
beer
and
this
beer
barrel
aged
would
probably
be
quite
a
treat
drinkability
with
its
sharp
punchy
bitterness
this
ones
definitely
an
americanized
old
ale
nice
dark
coffee
color
small
tan
head
tightly
packed
bubbles
smells
good
tastes
good
at
first
but
oh
that
aftertaste
quite
bitter
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
hard
and
stays
there
a
verystrong
hoppy
ale
nothing
subtle
or
nuanced
about
it
a
bit
syrupy
going
down
the
throat
too
dark
red
bordering
on
brown
with
a
minimal
head
ringing
the
glass
smell
is
good
and
taste
is
chewy
caramel
toffee
with
some
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
delicious
and
does
not
remind
me
at
all
of
a
barleywine
i
have
trouble
differentiating
the
two
styles
i
bet
the
barrelaged
version
is
a
tasty
beer
overall
a
good
and
drinkable
old
ale
if
i
buy
another
bottle
of
this
it
will
be
for
cellaring
pours
out
a
very
dark
ruby
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
nose
is
a
mix
of
dark
toffee
malts
citrusy
hops
booze
and
a
touch
of
diacetyl
taste
starts
off
with
some
dark
malty
sweetness
but
is
interrupted
by
some
harshly
bitter
hops
which
give
flavors
of
citrus
and
lots
of
aspirin
outofplace
butter
and
medicinal
alcohol
finishes
sweet
like
drinking
a
piloncillo
syrup
mouthfeel
is
full
slick
and
oily
this
could
use
a
decade
or
so
to
rest
heavy
handed
to
say
the
least
with
no
subtle
nuances
at
all
nearly
a
drain
pour
but
i
want
to
get
my
buzz
on
the
color
when
poured
was
a
medium
dark
thick
amber
with
some
foam
and
a
nice
amount
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
filled
the
nose
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
mild
hops
filled
my
taste
buds
with
a
hint
of
caramel
nicely
balanced
with
the
sweettartbitter
on
the
finish
a
pleasant
surprise
very
solid
old
ale
maybe
the
hoppiest
old
ale
ive
had
in
a
good
way
long
resiny
bitter
finish
mouth
is
chewy
and
medium
bodied
the
citrusy
grapefruit
hops
mesh
well
with
the
thick
syrupy
toffee
malt
milk
chocolate
covered
caramels
and
fig
with
dates
maple
brown
sugar
vanilla
orange
peel
and
mixed
nuts
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
with
some
showing
through
on
the
mouth
and
finish
but
adds
to
the
experience
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
this
is
a
nice
old
ale
a
bit
more
sturdy
and
strong
tasting
than
some
others
in
the
style
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
and
a
worthy
sipper
this
seems
like
a
beer
that
would
really
benefit
from
some
aging
good
tasting
for
the
style
but
man
glad
i
split
this
one
the
alcohol
taste
is
strong
this
could
cellar
for
years
and
just
get
better
still
a
good
beer
at
this
age
this
is
a
nice
release
from
eel
river
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
lacy
tan
head
lightly
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
with
an
herbal
hoppy
nose
apricot
pepper
and
the
maltyrich
flavors
of
rasins
plumbs
and
figs
a
nice
toffeerich
dessert
beer
overall
a
soothing
and
mildly
warming
beer
delicous
pours
a
dark
copper
to
amber
color
slight
haziness
with
a
cream
colored
head
sweet
caramel
breadiness
cereal
some
sweet
pruniness
and
dates
in
the
aroma
booziness
also
evident
in
the
smell
taste
shows
some
sweet
toffee
dates
and
fruitiness
a
decent
drying
somewhat
grassy
bitterness
and
a
slight
hint
of
licorice
and
roastiness
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
as
well
but
fairly
well
hidden
somewhat
creamy
medium
body
just
a
scant
thinner
than
what
i
like
somehat
unique
taste
made
this
beer
interesting
big
beer
that
is
on
the
sweet
side
i
like
it
but
i
can
see
where
some
will
find
it
sugary
and
too
sweet
d
this
one
definalty
will
pick
up
as
time
goes
by
just
a
bit
too
young
still
and
this
is
really
dampning
some
of
the
more
subtle
and
complex
tones
that
are
definatly
there
will
leave
a
few
in
the
closet
and
come
back
in
6mos
and
try
it
again
the
best
part
is
i
traded
him
for
two
bottles
so
i
have
another
in
the
cellar
to
enjoy
at
a
later
time
woo
hoo
d
not
overly
drinkable
but
i
could
smell
it
all
day
the
taste
is
honestly
disappointing
after
the
wonderful
immense
nose
drinkability
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
fruit
and
a
bit
less
bitter
flavor
frankly
but
this
is
a
decent
enough
old
ale
good
beer
give
it
a
try
poured
a
nice
brown
that
gleams
of
crisp
dark
amber
when
held
to
the
light
there
was
a
thin
head
that
was
slow
to
diminish
but
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
rich
array
of
malts
burnt
caramel
maple
and
some
dried
fruits
the
taste
is
also
very
complex
good
variety
of
malts
dance
on
the
palate
there
are
characters
of
burnt
caramel
and
dried
fruits
with
a
good
subdued
hop
base
that
is
doing
its
job
in
the
background
the
alcohol
certainly
weighs
down
the
beer
on
the
tongue
it
is
heavy
but
not
so
much
that
the
beer
is
undrinkable
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
while
i
do
consider
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
all
that
often
ill
stick
to
barley
wine
if
i
want
something
heavy
like
this
beer
is
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
garnet
highlights

held
up
to
the
light
a
smallish
tan
head
diminishes
quickly
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
fruity
hops
and
more
than
a
little
alcohol
palate
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
a
port
wine
character
dark
sweet
fruit
raisins
etc
and
a
touch
of
toffee
flavor
come
through
midpalate
finish
is
sweet
and
a
bit
hot
from
the
alcohol
body
is
thick
a
tad
sticky
and
occasionally
foamy
if
youre
not
careful
a
tasty
beer
very
assertive
and
flavorful
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
purchased
in
the
local
coop
in
a
22
oz
bottle
poured
a
very
dark
cherry
color
with
a
big
foamy
tan
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
very
rich
nose
of
burnt
malts
fruits
and
carmel
are
added
to
the
flavor
and
with
the
high
alcohol
content
this
is
almost
too
rich
and
powerful
a
bit
of
sweetness
somewhat
bitter
finish
interesting
brew
however
and
should
please
those
that
like
their
dark
beers
big
and
bold
i
opened
a
second
bottle
i
let
this
warm
up
a
little
to
about
45
f
it
again
poured
with
a
giant
foamy
light
brown
head
you
could
have
eaten
with
a
spoon
nose
is
even
more
intense
the
flavor
was
much
improved
and
much
smoother
dont
drink
this
too
cold
and
this
is
about
a
good
as
an
old
ale
can
get
many
thanks
to
lou91
for
this
one
really
good
but
even
the
viking
on
the
label
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
every
day
nor
more
than
one
bomber
in
a
night
i
hope
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
but
its
really
substantial
and
best
reserved
for
cold
nights
when
you
feel
like
a
beer
that
will
stick
to
your
ribs
pours
a
two
finger
pillowy
light
tan
head
that
fades

good
lace

heavy
bodied
sweet

ale
4

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
liquid
solutions
tigard
or
triple
exultation
indeed
because
there
are
three
beers
packed
into
a
22oz
bottle
this
beer
is
part
imperial
stout
part
doppelbock
and
part
wee
heavy
hell
maybe
it
should
be
called
quadruple
exultation
because
there
might
be
some
barleywine
hiding
in
there
as
well
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
its
all
good
and
it
all
works
together
malt
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
fruit
smoke
roast
a
nice
dose
of
balancing
hops
full
mouthfeel
and
a
reasonable
alcohol
bite
incredibly
complex
and
tasty
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
guzzled
in
any
style
or
in
this
case
almost
every
style
damn
i
dont
write
a
lot
of
review
these
days
not
much
time
but
this
is
one
hell
of
an
old
ale
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
dense
sticky
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
fruity
ester
and
a
floral
hop
the
flavor
is
chocolate
with
toffee
tones
a
light
bitterness
and
a
spicy
alcohol
hit
it
is
everything
i
want
out
of
an
old
ale
and
a
decent
price
overall
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
beer
i
really
like
the

ill
certainly
get
another

or
two
of
this
next

a
nice
enjoyable
old
ale
a
good
choice
of
style
for
the
winter
overall
fairly
green
as
fair
as
old
ales
go
but
i
see
some
potential
in
this
one
the
smell
doesnt
represent
the
nice
taste
and
the
flavors
show
some
potential
for
some
age
certainly
something
i
plan
on
trying
with
some
age
on
it

a

the

are

obviously

it
should
be
for

some

review
based
on
brew
bottled
in
1998
a
bit
thin
but
that
is
as
much
about
the
low
carbonation
as
anything
flavor
fades
on
palate
in
time
leaving
me
ready
to
place
that
joy
producing
elixir
right
back
on
there
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
fight
those
urges
and
make
this
wonderful
glass
of
beer
last
and
im
going
to
buy
some
more
worth
the
price
i
paid
o
very
tasty
brew
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
i
dig
it
its
a
very
complex
drinkable
moderate
strength
but
still
pleasantly
warming
beer
that
except
for
the
unfortunate
slight
metallic
finish
is
a
joy
to
experience
pours
a
thin
slightly
murky
dark
root
beer
color
that
is
headless
tons
of
dark
overly
ripe
fruits
dominate
the
aroma
with
plenty
of
age
sherry
notes
and
some
booziness
comprise
a
great
nose
first
sip
is
surprisingly
good
and
tasty
similar
to
what
the
nose
indicted
the
taste
is
full
of
those
lovely
dark
overly
ripe
fruits
like
plums
and
figs
it
starts
super
sweet
but
quickly
finishes
with
a
bitter
twist
that
really
captures
my
attention
sip
after
sip
after
sip
though
thin
bodied
and
lacking
some
carbonation
i
dont
care
as
this
puppy
has
plenty
to
offer
this
is
good
english
old
ale
a
prototype
for
the
style
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
beerit
has
the
complex
flavors
that
you
would
expect
from
a
barleywine
but
is
a
little
more
drinkable
because
it
doesnt
feel
as
heavy
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
from
the
taste
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
pours
a
medium
red
amber
minimal
offwhite
head
and
hints
of

nice

dark

a

faint

and
balanced
an

this

had
no

has
been
stored
refrigerated
for
a
year
a

with

maybe
some

ending
with

flavors
become
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
up
overall
a
good
ale
to
sip
on
cold
winter
nights
conclusion
for
not
being
bottle
conditioned
this
has
taken
the
years
with
surprising
grace
although
the
pasteurization
helped
ensure
it
didnt
end
of
a
sour
mess
it
is
certainly
the
best
20th
century
beer
i
have
had
the
other
was
gales
millennium
brew
i
love
old
beer
and
will
continue
looking
for
older
and
older
examples
of
beers
that
are
known
to
age
well
this
is
a
magical
beer
that
rivals
well
aged
j
w
lees
harvest
ales
and
gales
prized
old
ale
in
taste
but
becomed
deceptively
drinkable
with
its
dryish
body
and
finish
in
the
mouth
this
feels
fantastic
it
is
full
bodied
and
quite
heavy
the
carbonation
level
is
low
for
8
1
abv
it
is
not
the
least
bit
harsh
it
is
rich
and
smooth
yet
in
no
way
a
burden
to
drink
ive
not
had
a
barley
wine
that
was
this
close
to
perfection
without
any
required
extended
cellaring
the
price
works
out
to
about
5
per
12
ounce
serving
and
i
concede
that
this
is
easily
the
best
5
barley
wine
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
imbibing
in
this
case
the
small
275
ml
9
3
ounce
bottle
actually
felt
like
an
unnecessarily
large
serving
by
the
time
that
i
was
finished
it
had
warmed
to
room
temperature
and
was
no
worse
for
the
wear
this
is
worldclass
o
this
is
an
excellent
english
old
ale
its
a
benchmark
of
the
style
and
well
deserving
of
its
reputation
as
a
classic
i
have
been
very
fortunate
in
the
fact
that
i
have
tried
many
of
the
jubilee
ales
this
has
been
one
of
the
two
best
i
have
had
the
other
being
ansells
strong
ale
but
unfortunately
that
beer
is
not
on
here
to
be
reviewed
i
hope
to
someday
get
my
hands
on
another
of
these
although
im
sure
that
is
very
unlikely
now
i
suppose
i
should
try
some
of
the
later
vintages
of
this
beer
if
i
can
track
some
down
amazing
stuff
o
harveys
elizabethan
ale
misses
the
mark
its
too
sweet
and
lacks
any
sort
of
balance
i
will
say
that
due
to
the
prune
juice
like
flavor
profile
my
grandma
would
love
it
0
this
beer
actually
tastes
bigger
and
hotter
than
it
actually
is
usually
its
the
sign
of
good
brewing
for
a
beer
to
mask
its
alcoholic
fortitude
syrupy
and
tangy
im
hoping
this
is
just
an
off
batch
notes
didnt
see
a
date
but
i
was
told
it
was
98
and
from
other
reviews
that
looks
right
decent
old
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
sweet
dark
fruit
and
some
alcohol
provide
the
most
flavor
lacks
a
bit
of
the
fullness
and
complexity
that
i
would
expect
from
a
1213
year
old
ale
i
liked
it
and
it
had
some
regular
old
ale
aspects
but
it
is
nothing
special
and
didnt
show
the
complexity
that
can
come
with
aging
some
old
ales
i
feel
this
one
is
underrated
on
this
site
its
a
pretty
traditional
take
on
the
style
but
its
a
good
one
tastes
like
history
this
is
grrreat
no
real
significant
flaws
to
mention
can
i
get
some
more
i
need
to
double
triplecheck
some
things
i
know
where
to
get
more
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
mean
you
cannot
detect
an
ounce
of
alcohol
but
the
syrupy
texture
indicates
its
at
least
7
taste
isnt
offputting
i
have
already
finished
half
of
the
beer
just
trying
to
get
all
the
attributes
in
this
review
wish
i
would
have
found
this
a
year
or
2
ago
to
sample
before
its
removal
from
harveys
normal
lineup
to
be
had
on
the
first
brisk
day
of
the
year
as
a
transition
to
so
thicker
drinks
everything
speaks
malt
honey
an
aged
but
still
existent
head
some
stickiness
of
a
nearl
white
head
palate
is
chestnut
warm
coated
in
dark
sugars
i
nice
velvet
that
doesnt
coat
like
a
barley
wine
but
carries
the
carbonation
on
the
palate
for
some
old
and
english
an
exceptional
feel
would
go
great
with
mildly
seasoned
meat
drinkability
at
this
point
though
the
beers
not
horrible
its
not
particular
ally
great
i
have
to
be
totally
fair
and
say
i
have
never
had
a
fresher
example
of
this
beer
and
i
guess
never
will
so
cant
totally
rank
this
beer
at
all
wouldnt
be
fair
at
any
rate
this
beer
has
shown
it
could
handle
age
with
out
being
spoiled
hmm
wonder
what
this
once
was
overall
i
was
impressed
with
how
well
this
beer
held
up
and
would
bet
that
i
like
it
more
now
than
i
would
have
14
years
ago
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
one
around
d
despite
some
deficiences
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
felt
like
a
good
candidate
for
a
cool
or
cold
evening
in
front
of
the
fireplace
very
wine
like
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
conclusion
this
was
a
crazynice
surprise
that
i
found
at
lukas
in
kansas
city
i
had
always
wanted
to
try
this
and
never
thought
id
have
a
chance
its
definitely
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
im
guessing
this
ones
been
on
the
shelves
for
awhile
and
probably
not
under
ideal
conditions
that
being
the
case
its
held
up
pretty
well
d
a
vintage
i
would
certainly
not
grab
for
again
but
then
again
the
storage
of
the
bottle
is
a
bit
of
a
mystery
newer
vintages
will
yield
better
results
im
sure
overall
impressions
the
flavor
was
fine
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
me
wonder
if
the
bottle
was
a
bit
old
or
past
its
prime
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
another
bottle
for
comparison
to
see
if
this
one
was
a
good
example
it
does
drink
a
bit
like
a
wine
port
if
this
is
true
to
this
beer
i
would
not
buy
again
in
the
bottle
anyway
flat
waxy
taste
with
hints
of
what
might
have
been
nutty
raisin
eh
some
tobacco
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
followed
by
more
graperaisin
kind
of
a
gross
slickwaxy
feel
to
the
liquid
probably
wont
be
finishing
this
this
may
be
a
drainpour
for
me
i
think
ive
only
had
one
or
two
others
in
my
life
i
havent
had
a
fresh
one
of
these
but
i
would
have
to
say
this
did
not
age
well
at
all
d
overall
drinkability
was
fair
if
you
understood
the
direction
of
the
beer
would
not
recommend
to
the
casual
craft
drinker
as
you
may
get
the
impression
that
this
beer
is
bad
i
would
not
consider
drinking
more
then
one
of
these
at
any
given
sitting
and
it
is
highly
unlikely
i
would
be
a
repeat
purchaser
here
just
not
my
style
while
the
abv
was
detected
in
the
nose
its
almost
nonexistant
in
the
taste
if
you
like
portssherries
this
is
very
nice
if
you
dont
then
you
should
stay
away
this
has
very
nicely
balanced
bitter
finish
that
rounds
off
perfectly
i
could
easily
drink
another
if
i
had
it
the
pour
was
nice
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nearly
clouded
over
appearance
nice
little
head
of
tan
rose
up
over
the
top
and
settled
down
quickly
into
a
small
light
pillow
that
covered
just
enough
the
aroma
was
a
mixed
bag
of
earthy
malts
hints
of
a
light
hop
presence
and
a
smooth
delicate
profile
that
was
a
treat
to
behold
light
alcohol
note
as
it
warms
up
and
lots
of
caramel
as
you
move
in
the
flavor
was
rich
nice
touches
of
nuts
caramel
hints
of
cinnamon
and
spices
really
liven
it
up
a
very
full
palate
here
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
as
it
warms
and
the
long
slow
finish
was
just
wonderful
a
very
solid
little
beer
well
little
in
size
only
i
would
not
mind
having
another
for
sure
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
freind
cheers

im
going

i
dont
see
how
you
mark
it
down
on
any
attribute
a
fine
old
ale
barleywine
that
has
aged
with
grace
would
have
been
interesting
to
see
how
this
brew
tasted
fresh
this
makes
for
a
perfect
dessertbeer
or
just
something
to
sip
at
late
at
night
very
nice
d
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
beer
can
be
polarizing
to
the
bas
who
sample
it
i
personally
do
not
like
sherry
so
even
though
i
appreciated
what
a
work
of
art
this
brew
was
i
just
couldnt
enjoy
it
like
i
wanted
to
having
never
seen
a
fresh
bottle
of
elizabethan
ale
i
cant
be
sure
of
how
well
this
sample
has
held
up
i
do
hope
my
descriptions
can
provide
some
clues
whether
old
ale
or
barleywine
i
felt
it
fell
short
of
both
marks
still
it
was
something
i
enjoyed
albeit
less
as
a
beer
and
more
as
a
sort
of
british
digestif
a
strong
sipper
the
interesting
complexities
that
work
well
kept
me
wanting
to
sip
it
this
beer
is
in
my
wheelhouse
i
love
old
ales
particuarly
aged
old
ales
d
quite
good
drinkability
as
a
dessert
beer
or
a
way
to
wind
up
an
evening
like
a
fine
port
wine
another
beer
that
has
apparantly
been
retired
prematurely
if
its
still
available
and
a
style
meant
to
age
why
retire
it
anyway
bottle
purchased
from
johns

in

spotty
lacing
sweet
smelling
boozy
caramel
odor
very

and
milky
maple
syrup
demerara
sugar
grass
hops
bitterness
sweet

figs
and

what
little

there
are
keep
it
from
being
too
much
of
a
malt
and
alcohol
bomb
dry
and
thinner
than
expected
but
wtill
syrupy
and
id
say
medium
bodied
a
nice
sipper
of
an
old
ale
approaching
an
english
barleywine
in
most
qualities
very
tasty
and
interesting
pours
an
incredibly
viscous
murky
brown
with
very
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
sherry
like
with
raisins
prunes
and
a
touch
of
wood
taste
is
very
sweet
and
dessert
like
the
same
fruit
detectable
in
the
nose
is
here
but
a
little
more
subdued
smooth
and
honeyed
malt
with
a
trace
of
tannic
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
little
carbonation
makes
this
almost
like
a
rich
mead
fairly
complex
and
quite
nice
as
a
digestif
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
lighter
seeming
than
both
the
smell
and
appearance
would
suggest
nice
caramel
toffee
vinouous
notes
and
a
good
dose
of
malt
barely
wine
taste
big
malts
low
hops
sweet
but
bitter
sour
notes
oily
but
thin
mouthfeel
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
on
the
watery
side
to
be
a
barley
wine
nice
ale
but
not
an
old
ale
needs
to
be
brought
out
of
retirement
and
reclassed
as
a
barley
wine
md
rather
lubricating
on
the
mouthfeel
without
being
stickyheavy
at
all
at
8
1
it
somehow
tastes
like
6something
as
the
alc
as
well
as
fizziness
have
both
been
softened
greatly
by
the
aging
process
while
the
hoppyness
and
woodytannic
mouthfeel
both
make
the
palate
all
the
more
interesting
and
not
quite
boring
overall
this
ale
tastes
more
like
a
barley
wine
than
old
ale
to
me
yet
whichever
style
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
albeit
somewhat
understated
strong
ale
imho
this
poured
from
my
275ml
bottle
lifeless
and
flat
so
immediately
my
radar
is
up
for
other
flaws
although
the
label
says
to
see
the
cap
for

before
date
very
much
like

i
believe
this
is
the
first

by

this
was
quite
yummy
maybe
is
more
suited
as
a
nice
dessert
beer
not
as
big
as
a
barleywine
with
minimal
lacing
not
too
mellow
when
i
get
in
closer
though
sweet
malt
notes
dominate
the
aroma
is
oxidized
with
notes
of
sherry
raisins
leaving
a
very
big
raisin
bread
aroma
i
like
that
a
lot
better
the
flavor
is
huge
on
raisin
across
the
top
of
the
middle
of
my
tongue
there
is
a
flavor
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
i
cant
place
some
bready
and
creamy
nots
as
well
in
there
the
feel
is
moderate
chocolate
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
has
some
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate

nice
example
of
a
strong
english
ale
with
outstanding
color
just
doesnt
deliver
at
all
just
tastes
like
an
old
ale
i
aged
one
for
two
years
wasnt
hot
like
ive
heard
but
had
no
flavor
poured
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
from
a
22
oz
bottle
this
is
a
beer
that
will
probably
improve
with
age
it
is
young
and
hot
to
the
point
of
almost
not
being
able
to
enjoy
it
fresh
d
one
is
enough
for
sure
overall
just
not
an
impressive
beer
too
sweet
and
uncomplex
t
starts
with
some
ripe
grape
sweetness
but
quickly
tails
into
a
dry
boozy
mess
burnt
raisin
skins
burnt
brown
sugar
and
straight
boozy
heat
way
hot
for
not
being
that
high
in
abv
may
need
a
little
time
interesting
beer
pushing
the
lines
of
wine
and
beer
a
bit
closer
the
malt
profile
of
this
beer
really
lend
well
to
the
wine
elements
without
knowing
what
went
into
this
beer
id
think
it
was
a
really
grapey
and
earthy
double
esb
overall
awfully
similar
to
dogfish
heads
midas
touch
in
terms
of
flavor
though
i
prefer
this
one
a
bit
more
mostly
due
to
the
more
approachable
body
if
i
never
had
this
again
i
wouldnt
miss
it
but
its
certainly
something
id
consider
buying
again
price
dependent
high
c
o
a
decent
beer
that
i
went
back
and
forth
on
from
sip
to
sip
very
boozy
and
definitely
sipping
worthy
i
enjoy
that
they
collaborated
with
the
local
temecula
wine
country
a
unique
spin
on
an
old
style
worth
trying
you
have
to
like
the
old
ale
style
and
to
me
they
seem
to
always
be
a
challenge
this
one
is
very
sudsy
and
that
adds
to
the
palatability
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
barons
marketplace
in
san
diego
drink
im
glad
i
have
a
bottle
to
sit
on
and
let
meld
a
bit
more
this
is
a
bit
young
imo
a
very
strange
beer
and
probably
not
one
id
want
to
try
again
pours
blood
red

a

a
weird
combination
of
smoke
maybe
the
char
from
the
oak
and
grape
heavily
toasted
malts
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
fruit
coming
through
sweet
with
a
decent
grape
character
but
fairly
watery
a
touch
of
toast
along
with
the
dark
fruit
character
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
fruit
and
wood
taste
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
fruit
and
wood
there
is
a
woody
aftertaste
with
each
sip
that
lingers
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
and
interesting
beer
in
terms
of
the
ingredients
overall
good
beer
maybe
one
of
my
two
favorites
from
hangar
but
i
feel
like
the
flavor
is
just
missing
something
o
this
was
a
joy
to
try
the
best
ive
ever
had
from
hangar
24
o
interesting
beer
not
my
style
though
extremely
dark
in
appearance
and
rich
in
flavor
but
poured
completely
flat
and
the
booze
is
very
forward
on
the
tongue
hot
boozy
notes
of
coco
soy
and
earthy
dried
fruit
plums
apricots
not
really
my
thing
but
gotta
respect
what
it
is
how
it
was
made
2014
version
flat
as
stated
on
the
bottle
but
amazing
smell
and
flavor
great
beer
great
but
normal
adam
is
just
so
good
it
says
its
flat
and
it
is
however
that
has
no
impact
on
flavor
and
is
damn
delicious
just
didnt
seem
to
have
a
great
flavor
nothing
stood
out
for
me
lack
of
carb
in
this
really
killed
it
for
me
i
prefer
the
base
adam
the
barrel
just
added
basic
wood
notes
and
detracted
from
the
overall
taste

bourbon
light
vanilla
and
molasses
is
quite
singular
taste
is
also
dominated
by
tobacco
with
some

notes
clearly
identifiable
residual
sugars
are
also
easily
identifiable
with
light

alcohol
body
is
quite
full
with
almost
zero
carbonation
this
is
almost
like
drinking
an
old
sherry
or
xeres
and
makes
for
a
perfect
nightcap
the
lack
of
carbonationis
not
a
big
issue
and
i
thought
it
would
be
the
complexities
of
the
beer
linger
and
the
medium
plus
to
full
mouthfeel
make
up
for
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
last
one
i
tried
had
carbonation
issues
so
tough
to
give
a
true
rating
way
too
sweet
sickeningly
so
unfinished
fermentation
draft
hotd
big
beer
though
not
hot
bourbon
really
changes
the
base
beer
tobacco
and
smoke
are
gone
not
huge
on
bourbon
flavor
tho
it
just
smoothes
everything
out
terrific
o
if
you
read
this
heed
my
advice
dont
bother
letting
this
get
too
cold
as
it
must
be
had
warm
unless
of
course
you
enjoy
muted
flavors
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
eager
to
try
the
cherry
variant
this
is
wonderful
its
meaty
yet
sweet
like
dessert
but
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
as
the
oak
really
drys
out
the
finish
i
think
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
what
gives
the
impression
that
the
beer
is
sweet
since
there
are
no
scrubbing
bubbles
to
clean
the
palate
i
love
the
aroma
enjoy
the
flavors
and
would
be
ecstatic
to
have
this
around
all
the
time
i
still
think
i
prefer
cherry
adam
though
this
is
outstanding
very
glad
demand
was
down
and
i
got
several
bottles
this
will
be
fun
to
revisit
the
next
few
years
verdict
i
liken
this
to
something
like
a
tawny
port
wine
a
very
fine
one
at
that
but
with
so
many
flavorful
and
complex
oak
aged
beers
on
the
market
this
just
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
with
a
flat
body
i
definitely
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
over
the
course
of
an
evening
and
it
was
a
lovely
after
dinner
beer
but
the
potential
for
true
greatness
slipped
past
this
one
o
good
but
not
ridiculously
so
id
be
wary
of
trading
a
kings
ransom
for
this
drink
i
pretty
much
made
a
trip
to
pdx
for
this
and
i
am
glad
i
did
overall
this
is
just
about
the
most
magnificent
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
very
unique
and
crazy
delicious
beyond
worldclass
o
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
its
got
that
undeniably
hair
of
the
dog
quality
and
takes
it
close
to
the
apex
even
the
flat
2014
batch
beats
out
most
other
big
barrel
aged
beers
for
me
although
it
is
of
course
better
with
carb
on
tap
or
from
2011
superb
d
delicious
and
decadent
a
beer
for
an
ocassion
overall
great
beer
really
solid
definitely
worth
a
try
is
it
20
bucks
good
im
not
sure
but
probably
not
outstanding
beer
though
no
surprise
to
anyone
worth
it
if
youre
ever
in
portland
o
complex
interesting
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
alcohol
hit
well
hidden
its
tight
like
a
three
year
barrel
aged
beer
should
be
good
stuff
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
its
flat
and
thats
problematic
as
its
a
heavy
beer
and
it
ends
up
feeling
sludgy
also
the
flavors
are
potent
and
varied
but
not
to
the
degree
that
id
like
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
imo
its
not
on
the
level
at
least
at
2
years
of
many
of
my
favorites
hotd
matt
for
example
has
much
better
barrel
integration
and
is
just
a
much
better
beer
i
even
like
the
regular
adam
better
than
this
one
overall
adam
from
the
wood
is
an
outstanding
barrel
aged
old
ale
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
little
bit
of
oxidization
in
the
flavour
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
would
have
been
in
my
all
time
top
5
beers
glad
to
finally
get
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
and
see
what
everyone
has
been
raving
about
no
wonder
people
love
it
as
good
as
it
is
though
i
still
prefer
matt
just
a
bit
as
its
slightly
more
complex
yet
even
more
drinkable
or
at
least
as
drinkable
as
any
10
abv
old
ale
could
dream
to
be
no
matter
adam
from
the
wood
is
fantastic
and
i
need
to
keep
my
hunting
spears
ready
when
the
next
batch
is
hopefully
released
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
am
happy
to
have
had
it
a
big
beer
that
doesnt
get
carried
away
with
sweetness
and
incredibly
smooth
both
in
terms
of
flavor
and
feel
fuller
medium
body
softer
carbonation
chewy
and
soft
on

holy
crap
these
barrelaged
hotd
beers
are
seriously
out
of
this
world
between
the
cherry
adam
and
this
i
was
reeling
immediately
fawning
all
over
the
place
telling
people
how
great
it
was
complex
warm
and
explosively
flavorful
i
want
more
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
hands
down
thank
you
so
much
brett
adam
from
the
wood
is
a
worldclass
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
from
hair
of
the
dog
overall
this
was
excellent
its
definitely
barrel
heavy
but
the
interplay
between
barrel
and
base
beer
works
here
with
enough
leather
and
smoke
from
adam
to
make
an
impact
a
really
good
barrel
aged
ale
that
lived
up
to
my
already
high
expectations
would
definitely
drink
this
again
cheers
claaark13
overall
an
awesome
sweet
and
woody
treat
glad
i
ordered
it
and
would
again
even
at
20
o
fantastic
tremendous
flavor
profile
and
incredibly
drinkable
especially
for
12
would
love
to
sip
this
one
over
an
evening
o
most
excellent
super
complex
and
smooth
this
would
age
very
nicely
thanks
again
brian
i
also
had
this
this
past
weekend
thanks
to
mike
the
above
review
still
holds
i
would
highly
recommend
not
aging
this
since
it
is
a
already
so
old
b
is
slightly
red
wine
and
port
tart
so
may
gain
acidity
c
is
already
delicious

can

only
gain

the
hype
it
receives
ive
had
this
one
before
and
remembered
digging
it
a

more
the
first
time
around
but
still
an
incredibly
impressive
beer
my
favorite
of
the

overall
amazing
i
love
regular

so
this
beer
more
than
lives

for
me
the

the

leathery
and
with

enough
to
make

want
a

this

beer
is

this

my
only
complaint
i
wish
there
was
more
adam
below
the
bourbon
great
blend
though
very
rich
a
beer
for
sipping
i
had
this
sidebyside
with
the
matt
and
this
was
clearly
the
lesser
of
the
two
although
thats
comparing
something
to
nearperfection
this
was
sharper
crisper
and
harsher
but
theres
no
doubting
the
complexity
and
scope
of
both
these
beers
they
are
truly
impressive
examples
of
the
craft
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
while
its
a
4
5
on
my
rating
id
say
its
closer
to
a
4
75
what
a
great
treat
from
barry
which
was
definitely
appreciated
in
december
2011
when
he
gave
me
the
bottle
but
even
more
tonight
when
i
drank
it
iso
more
bottles
o
really
complex
and
another
great
sipper
from
hotd
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
and
age
it
for
a
year
or
two
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
the
flavors
meld
wonderfully
and
this
beer
is
a
sublime
sipper
as
a
lover
of
the
base
beer
i
am
pleasantly
giddy
with
this
incantation
a
must
seek
for
sure
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
please
bm
me
and
id
be
happy
to
work
something
out
with
you
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
the
nose
was
a
little
old
and
boozy
but
that
booze
didnt
come
through
much
in
the
taste
it
is
a
sweet
beer
but
a
good
one
would
like
to
have
it
again
pours
a
burnished
deep
brown
thin
ring
of
head
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
nary
any
head
sans
dissipation
no
visible
carbonation
a
truly
complex
nose
the
light
charring
of
the
barrels
produces
a
clean
wood
character
to
go
along
with
the
everpresent
adam
leather
and
smoke
notes
much
more
subtle
than
the
base
beer
taste
is
equally
complex
leather
smoke
some
vanilla
raisins
a
bit
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
hops
are
a
secondary
partner
in
this
ultracomplex
beer
of
the
gods
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
much
in
the
way
of

one
of
the

edit
a
revisit
of
the
same
batch
at

confirms
that
this
is
some
stellar
shit
o
this
brew
absolutely
lives
up
to
the
hype
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
in
any
style
and
totally
unique
seek
it
out
a
special
and
unique
beer
once
again
from
hotd
o
nice
beer
but
not
out
of
this
world
enjoyed
it
but
probably
fell
victim
to
the
hype

and
a
touch

mediumbodied
overall
a
very
nice
old
ale
didnt
blow
anything
out
of
the
water
for
me
i
will
not
go
at
great
length
for
this
brew
anymore
and
stick
with
the
more
accessible
adam
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
overall
i
strongly
suggest
trying
this
at
some
point
it
is
one
of
the
best
old
ales
i
have
ever
had
i
personally
prefer
the
cherry
adam
to
this
one
but
this
is
one
is
still
exceptional
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on

of
the

this
beer
has
a
very
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
very

the
wood
pours
a
medium
bodied
cola
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
light
beige
head
it
looks
perfect
and
the
creamy
head
stayed
for
the
entirety
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
smooth
and
creamy
i
get
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
and
cola
along
with
vanilla
and
cream
it
smells
like
the
perfect
old
ale
the
flavors
are
ridiculous
its
plenty
malty
with
just
a
touch
of
bourbon
there
is
smooth
cream
and
vanilla
with
some
figs
its
really
interesting
and
complex
it
drinks
light
and
velvety
so
smooth
i
really
like
it
although
i
prefer
old
stock
bourbon
and
bourbon
barrel
fourth
dementia
to
it
by
far
the
difference
is
the
amount
of
bourbon
this
tastes
like
it
is
aged
since
it
is
and
is
a
few
years
old
and
i
would
assume
it
has
mellowed
out
a
tad
id
would
love
to
try
this
at
year
two
from
the
barrel
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
really
dont
know
what
else
to
say
overall
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
regular
adam
is
just
as
good
but
less
complex
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
difference
between
this
and
the
regular
version
is
huge
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
beer
huge
viscous
body
brings
everything
together
tons
of
wellcrafted
flavors
make
this
immensely
enjoyable
aftw
is
something
every
beer
geek
needs
to
sample
one
of
my
favorites
overall
its
an
impressive
beer
with
impressive
flavors
too
sweet
which
is
strange
because
adam
is
hardly
sweet
im
also
surprised
it
isnt
as
dominated
by
bourbon
three
years
is
a
long
time
o
wow
adam
is
already
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
and
this
takes
it
to
another
level
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
i
had
this
the
same
night
as
i
had
a
dark
lord
and
it
boggles
my
mind
how
dark
lord
gets
so
much
hype
and
a
beer
like
this
almost
flies
under
the
radar
had
next
to
8
or
10
different
vintages
of
adam
pour
is
dark
brown
with
red
edges
and
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
is
heavy
barrel
rather
sweet
bourbon
almost
on
the
verge
of
brandi
light
olive
and
some
heat
the
taste
is
more
base
adam
forward
but
still
has
a
strong
barrel
presence
the
chocolate
is
stronger
sweet
dark
fruits
notes
of
bourbon
and
faint
heat
the
body
is
a
bit
thinner
still
silky
but
not
as
creamy
fair
carbonation
not
as
good
as
base
adam
but
still
a
nice
beer
full
bodied
great
beer
complex
balanced
and
delicious
o
a
slow
sipper
with
phenomenal
complexity
and
flavors
fantastic
stuff
this
shows
so
many
flavors
over
the
course
of
a
bottle
another
winner
from
hotd
o
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
that
ive
had
this
one
reminds
me
a
bit
of
king
henry
with
maybe
a
bit
more
complexity
perfect
amount
of
bourbon
not
too
hot
not
too
sweet
or
cloying
this
is
a
top
notch
of
a
beer
and
worth
getting
your
hands
on
a
bottle
if
you
get
a
chance
pretty
good
beer
but
not
sure
given
how
much
it
takes
to
trade
for
if
id
value
it
that
high
glad
i
got
to
try
it
4
0
t
its
very
tasty
but
probably
not
worth
the
hefty
trading
value
bb4d
blows
this
out
of
the
water
anyway
for
half
the
price
in
any
case
im
glad
i
could
try
it
the
mouthfeel
leans
a
little
towards
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
fantastic
beer
the
bold
mlatiness
of
adam
is
perfectly
complimented
by
the
smooth
bourbon
it
really
comes
together
well
and
they
balanced
the
barrel
and
beer
flavors
perfectly
it
was
incredibly
smooth
for
12
as
well
relentlessly
decadent
brew
that
is
an
absolute
must
for
sweettooths
those
who
arent
will
undoubtedly
prefer
the
base
beer
o
a
real
good
ale
tasty
and
heavy
2011
vintage
overall
score
of
4
6
as
a
side
note
i
tasted
this
one
sidebyside
with
matt
and
adam
and
this
one
was
the
best
no
comparison
i
thought
matt
was
world
class
so
i
was
shocked
this
one
was
clearly
superior
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
wow
i
was
going
in
expecting
a
lot
but
this
one
still
succeeded
to
impress
me
i
cant
find
one
bad
thing
with
beer
id
love
to
have
this
side
by
side
with
ba
4d
both
beers
are
world
class
i
think
this
one
might
beat
it
just
barely
o
an
awesome
beer
in
the
vein
bb4d
ba
coton
and
ba
papier
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
ever
i
dont
know
if
the
new
batch
is
as
good
but
if
it
is
im
going
to
get
a
ton
of
it
a
beer
to
savor
and
enjoy
i
like
it
but
its
not
as
epic
as
i
thought
cheers
o
a
great
beer
you
can
really
see
how
this
benefited
from
being
in
the
barrel
for
over
3
years
o
exceptional
look
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
would
without
question
drink
it
again
but
when
asked
what
my
favorite
barrel
aged
old
ale
is
i
can
assure
you
that
señor
adam
de
la
wood
wont
be
topping
my
list
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
head
is
tan
beer
and
head
are
both
noticeably
darker
than
the
regular
adam
smells
of
bourbon
and
dark
fruit
interestingly
a
bit
like
a
quad
taste
is
awesome
the
bourbon
really
mixes
perfectly
with
the
dark
fruit
and
the
maltiness
of
the
base
beer
has
notes
of
vanilla
as
well
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
delicious
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
pretty
much
spoton
overall
this
beer
is
really
amazing
an
incredible
execution
of
barrel
aging
with
an
already
fantastic
beer
d
yet
another
profoundly
excellent
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
each
release
just
makes
me
more
and
more
impressed
particularly
when
taking
into
account
the
barrel
aged
beers
in
their
portfolio
definitely
a
sipper
if
there
ever
was
one
but
one
i
would
and
could
easily
have
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
right
up
there
with
matt
as
their
best
beer
i
have
had
from
them
so
far
2011
bottle

a
very
dark
burgundychestnut
that
appears
near
black
in
the

with
a
small

head
of
super
tight
bubbles
nose
is
dates
and
cherries
soaked
in
brandy
leather
smoke
a
touch
of
brine
which
is
just
classic
adam
very
decadent
alcoholic
details
on
the

is
very
creamy
rich
alcohol
heat
throughout
lots
of
dripping
dark
fruits
in
brandy
bourbon
brine
and
leather
in
the
mid
palate
with
a
pleasantly
hot
finish
takes
the
edgy
qualities
of
a
2
year
old
adam
and
just
adds
dimensions
of
complexity
ive
been
looking
for
this
beer
wistfully
for
years
and
was
stoked
to
see
it
was
being
released
again
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
11
batch
shared
by
beerdy
last
month
pours
a
dark
brown
that
borders
on
black
topped
by
a
thin
cap
the
nose
is
rather
decadent
showcasing
a
ton
of
bourbon
and
oak
the
signature
leather
and
tobacco
aroma
of
adam
is
still
present
along
with
vanilla
light
nuttiness
smoke
and
somewhat
brash
but
not
unwelcome
alcohol
the
palate
is
warming
and
sweet
bourbon
at
the
forefront
with
plenty
of
oak
tannin
vanilla
and
caramel
lightly
oxidized
still
surprisingly
hot
despite
all
the
years
in
the
barrel
the
earthiness
of
adam
shines
through
past
the
big
barrel
flavors
contributing
leather
and
tobacco
dark
fruit
subtle
smoke
the
body
is
mediumfull
it
feels
a
bit
more
hefty
than
the
nonbarreled
adam
a
fantastic
beer
overall
though
it
may
benefit
from
some
time
in
the
bottle
to
tame
the
heat
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
cherry
adam
that
im
looking
forward
to
trying
soon
o
adam
ftw
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
but
only
because
people
are
asking
for
750ml
bottles
of
cbs
for
one
12
oz
bottle
of
it
it
is
a
spectacular
ba
old
ale
that
should
be
sought
and
savored
just
dont
trade
your
cellar
for
it
old
ale
indeed
i
dont
think
sitting
on
this
is
going
to
help
it
its
aged
already
and
ready
to
drink
were
this
still
drinkability
a
5
here
would
be
a
no
brainer
forget
it
you
wont
find
a
beer
of
this
style
of
delicious
and
full
flavor
as
drinkable
as
this
still
a
5
best
of
the
class
here
i
didnt
find
the
bottled
version
to
be
as
intense
complex
or
interesting
as
the
sample
i
had
on
tap
in
september
at
the
brewery
adam
from
the
wood
isnt
just
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
hair
of
the
dog
its
one
of
the
best
big
beers
to
come
off
the
west
coast
in
a
long
time
highly
recommended
edit
from
314
lucky
for
me
i
now
live
near
the
hotd
tasting
room
again
and
so
get
to
taste
this
beer
from
time
to
time
as
expected
time
has
been
this
beers
friend
and
bottles
of
this
now
taste
incredible
i
have
modified
my
ratings
and
score
accordingly
o
just
delicious
i
cant
get
over
the
smell
it
was
fantastic
awesome
amazing
delicious
i
want
more
so
much
more
what
else
can
i
say
if
this
isnt
on
he
top
of
your
wantswhales
list
put
it
there
awesome
excellent
beer
my
favorite
of
a
night
of
good
beer
this
is
topshelf
a
great
beer
i
was
mostly
tasting
the
barrels
would
probablly
change
with
some
age
on
it
to
me
does
not
have
the
complexity
of
matt
but
is
still
outstanding
beer
is
medium
in
body
a
little
thinner
than
expected
a
little
stronger
than
i
expected
very
oaky
very
vanilla
and
bourbony
strong
throughout
very
good
an
interesting
variant
on
adam
adam
still
is
awesome
but
this
beer
is
slightly
more
awesomer
the
body
is
nice
and
full
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
great
tough
to
beat
this
is
delicious
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
thin
tan
collar
the
nose
carries
a
good
amount
of
musty
oak
and
bourbon
plus
malt
and
some
slight
tobacco
flavor
has
a
bit
more
bourbon
and
isnt
quite
as
integrated
but
is
still
quite
nice
medium
bodys
with
no
alcohol
and
low
carbonation
standout
stellar
beer
boom
very
sweet
and
smooth
body
with
light
carbonation
barrel
is
much
more
well
integrated
than
bourbon
fred
bourbon
cherry
plum
tobacco
oak
and
brown
sugar
carry
the
flavor
rich
and
sweet
but
more
enjoyable
than
matt
bourbon
fred
or
cherry
adam
alcohol
is
present
throughout
but
not
off
putting
amazing
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
thin
beige
cap
the
aroma
offers
bourbon
oak
very
enticing
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
regular
adam
bourbon
overpowers
some
if
the
more
subtle
aspects
of
the
beer
great
flavor
melts
in
your
mouth
smooth
feel
with
alcohol
heat
masterfully
contained
lingering
bourbon
in
the
aftertaste
though
exceptionally
soft
on
the
palate
overall
outstanding
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
while
the
individual
ingredients
and
flavoring
of
this
can
be
picked
apart
as
drastically
unique
in
their
own
right
they
really
blend
and
tie
together
very
well
in
this
this
is
a
fantastic
sipper
of
a
brew
with
a
great
depth
of
character
i
know
it
is
already
so
many
years
in
the
making
but
honestly
i
am
curious
what
more
aging
would
do
to
this
already
fine
example
o
i
am
blown
away
by
this
beer
full
flavored
perfectly
balanced
and
just
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
a
must
try
cheers
positively
amazing
overall
this
beer
is
just
what
i
expected
and
more
great
job
hotd
if
this
ages
like
your
other
beers
this
will
be
even
more
heavenly
in
a
few
years
o
definitely
a
wow
factor
beer
big
complex
and
in
your
face
just
delicious
and
an
improvement
on
one
of
my
faves
in
regular
adam
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
and
perfect
but
overall
this
beer
was
a
total
letdown
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
a
touch
of
light
offwhite
head
smells
barrel
heavy
with
some
slight
odd
aromas
smells
similar
to
the
tequila
black
hole
interesting
tastes
very
sweet
and
bourbony
well
carbonated
overall
good
but
not
stellar
a
bit
boozy
would
drink
it
agin
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
overy
very
stellar
beer
o
if
there
is
any
beer
out
there
to
slowly
savor
and
sip
on
this
is
it
so
much
flavor
packed
into
every
little
sip
adam
is
a
fantastic
beer
to
begin
with
but
put
him
in
bourbon
barrels
for
over
three
years
and
you
have
a
masterpiece
many
thanks
to
alan
for
continuing
to
create
such
incredible
and
unique
beers
taste
was
incredible
think
adam
with
strong
bourbon
coconut
and
vanilla
notes
the
bourbon
was
in
perfect
balance
with
the
beer
and
not
overpowering
it
it
doesnt
feel
hot
at
all
either
its
wonderful
to
drink
immediately
o
very
solid
its
a
bit
young
but
i
predict
it
will
age
phenomenally
im
looking
forward
to
tracking
its
progress
in
a
year
or
two
in
retrospect
i
regret
not
asking
for
more
of
this
overall
this
beer
is
quite
an
experience
its
among
the
best
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
alan
youve
made
another
masterpiece
like
im
surprised
lol
o
amazing
beer
not
the
best
ever
but
certainly
complex
and
good
scary
drinkable
for
12
o
while
i
thought
the
2000
vintage
had
too
much
oak
the
2011
vintage
is
just
spoton
outstanding
the
booze
is
wellhidden
the
oak
is
perfect
the
the
sweetness
is
topnotch
an
awesome
beer
to
say
the
least
thick
and
carbonated
easily
drinkable
for
its
abv
and
despite
its
heft
o
doing
really
well
at
1
5
years
old
drained
this
way
too
fast
considering
the
price
tag
good
thing
theres
more
o
a
truly
wonderful
beer
just
like
the
base
adam
its
one
of
a
kind
call
me
crazy
but
i
think
i
actually
prefer
the
nonbarrel
aged
base
beer
though
that
could
be
due
to
as
i
stated
in
the
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
being
too
big
and
hot
at
the
moment
id
love
to
stash
a
few
bottles
of
this
away
for
a
year
or
so
and
see
if
that
helps
it
integrate
better
just
let
me
know
when
these
are
getting
released
and
count
on
seeing
me
in
line
45
o
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
after
the
let
down
known
as
cherry
adam
i
wasnt
sure
any
barrel
aged
adam
was
going
to
make
the
cut
and
i
was
wrong
this
beer
is
exceptional
o
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
utterly
delicious
and
perfectly
balanced
a
benchmark
for
barrelaged
beers
ill
be
at
the
tasting
room
any
time
alan
puts
this
on
bottle
dark
brown
a
bit
shiny
no
head
the
nose
is
phenomenal
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
had
sweet
molasses
bourbon
brown
sugar
the
taste
isnt
as
bursting
as
the
nose
a
little
flat
but
outstanding
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
oaky
with
smoke
a
small
complaint
but
still
great
try
this
this
is
pretty
impressive
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
come
across
of
both
an
old
ale
and
barrel
aging
in
general
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
its
hard
to
describe
the
layers
of
complexity
i
could
drink
this
daily
for
a
long
time
and
discover
new
facets
every
time
truly
phenomenal
overall
a
highlight
of
an
already
starstudded
beercation
nothing
can
compare
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
ive
had
nothing
similar
d
delicious
stuff
that
has
aged
extremely
well
im
curious
how
the
new
batch
compares
seeing
as
it
was
only
aged
for
roughly
half
as
long
in
any
case
this
was
a
real
treat
a
sipper
with
its
rich
flavor
and
deceptive
alcohol
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
while
a
wow
that
i
was
sad
to
have
come
to
an
end
but
so
happy
to
have
tried
i
have
been
in
love
with
the
adambier
from
day
1
this
just
takes
it
up
a
notch
or
five
a
rumored
bottling
in
fall
2011
should
put
this
acclaimed
ale
into
many
more
eager
hands
and
bellies
the
line
begins
forming
now
d
yes
at
3
years
this
is
definitely
bourbon
heavy
in
addition
they
did
not
choose
a
particularly
smoky
adam
to
put
in
those
barrels
and
even
after
3
years
its
still
pretty
damn
hoppy
and
bitter
im
thinking
the
smoke
is
dwelling
in
there
but
the
beer
needs
another
couple
years
to
meld
the
heat
and
suppress
some
of
the
hops
vanilla
oak
as
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
strong
ale
this
is
a
handsdown
great
beer
compared
to
the
2000
this
is
just
good
this
will
be
released
in
bottles
this
fall
guessing
1512oz
and
it
will
be
imperative
to
purchase
several
to
sit
on
if
i
can
recreate
the
magic
of
the
2000
batch
with
age
it
will
be
worth
every
penny
o
i
was
amazed
by
the
carbonation
and
the
complex
flavors
a
in
my
book
i
could
drink
this
till
i
fall
off
the
stool
o
just
f
awesome
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
nothing
else
can
compare
i
wish
i
could
take
a
keg
home
d
its
a
big
heavy
beer
but
it
has
so
much
flavor
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
if
i
had
another
bottle
i
dont
think
i
could
let
it
sit
very
long
and
probably
would
opened
it
by
now
what
an
amazing
beer
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
old
ales
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
magnum
that
was
shared
at
the
opening
of
the
new
hair
of
the
dog
brewpub
poured
opaque
brown
with
no
head
except
for
a
little
bit
of
bubbles
at
the
surface
aroma
had
lots
of
bourbon
and
brandylike
booze
heavy
with
alcohol
and
even
notes
of
cocoa
and
buttery
malts
not
as
smokey
as
regular
adam
it
seemed
to
have
lost
that
in
either
the
barrel
aging
or
the
bottle
aging
little
carbonation
hot
with
whiskey
flavors
and
notes
of
prunes
currants
savory
meats
and
a
little
bit
of
roast
very
fortified
like
a
fine
port
wine
d
a
fairly
high
abv
beer
but
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
bourbon
presence
might
be
a
bit
for
some
but
i
found
this
on
quite
enjoyable
get
to
stuffed
sandwich
stat
ive
had
adam
before
but
from
the
woods
this
was
beautiful
there
wasnt
very
much
head
and
it
did
fall
fast
the
flavors
settled
really
well
and
stayed
in
your
mouth
thick
cream
but
smooth
finish
definately
a
winter
warmer
but
there
was
no
part
of
this
beer
that
i
didnt
enjoy
all
the
way
through
it
was
unbelievable
so
tasty
i
sank
into
the
moment
with
the
first
mouthful
mmm
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brownred
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
alcoholic
bourbon
oak
coffeeroast
malts
some
dark
fruit
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
caramel
and
bourbonoak
flavors
but
even
more
alcohol
flavor
fairly
sweet
finish
also
has
some
earthy
bitterness
that
sticks
around
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
but
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
stick
around
on
the
palate
making
this
one
a
little
less
drinkable
for
me
very
interesting
beer
very
well
done
and
very
tasty
i
knew
i
would
like
this
and
who
would
not
enjoy
adam
that
spent
over
seven
years
in
a
barrel
another
great
brew
from
hair
of
the
dog
cannot
wait
to
try
the
cherry
version
now
and
compare
these
i
hope
this
is
released
again
in
the
future
i
want
more
recommended
murky
swampy
brown
with
no
head
at
all
honestly
it
didnt
look
particularly
appetizing
but
to
convey
the
overall
awesomeness
of
this
brewski
i
have
to
give
it
a
higher
score
pretty
light
aroma
consisting
mostly
of
portlike
dark
malt
tons
of
sherry
steeped
fruit
vanilla
and
oaksoaked
creamines
smells
like
its
been
waiting
for
me
to
sip
and
waiting
patiently
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
malt
engraved
into
wooden
slats
absolutely
soaked
in
vanillalike
oak
no
barrel
feel
just
straight
oak
and
all
its
creamy
wildness
powerful
roastiness
minimal
if
any
carbonation
the
barest
sparkle
on
the
swallow
pretty
much
flat
if
you
like
cask
ale
this
is
great
if
not
this
might
not
qualify
as
beer
to
you
huge
thick
body
with
a
coating
lasting
mouthfeel
the
juicy
malt
flavor
lingers
forever
hops
leave
trace
residue
of
earthiness
but
contribute
no
bitterness
at
this
point
finishes
molasseslike
and
hugely
biting
in
its
sweetness
very
sweet
so
much
so
that
its
reserved
for
true
beer
aficionados
only
many
people
at
the
gathering
could
hardly
manage
three
or
four
ounces
of
the
stiff
more
for
the
rest
of
us
i
certainly
indulged
and
enjoyed
every
sip
adam
should
always
be
kept
in
the
wood
imprison
that
evil
bastard
a
most
interesting
aroma
of
peat
alcohol
scotch
port
appearance
was
deceiving
because
of
soap
like
bubbles
no
head
taste
barley
bourbon
salty
barrel
wood
thanks
to
woolfs
at
doug
shoemaker
tasting
the
taste
the
alcohol
must
be
sipped
speed
bumps
slowing
us
all
down
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
syrupy
nearly
liqour
like
consistency
just
a
damn
fine
brew
that
i
dunno
if
ill
ever
be
able
to
try
again
highly
recommended
and
i
seriously
hope
i
get
the
chance
to
run
across
this
again
someday
flat
baby
cherry
rye
thinner
and
less
sweet
but
outstanding
had
both
2012
and
2014
variants
one
was
flat
the
was
ok
not
sure
where
the
hype
comes
from
but
this
beer
doesnt
meet
expectations
i
had
for
it
not
enough
cherry
too
much
tabacco
taste
im
a
chewer
just
not
my
gig
do
get
some
raisin
notes
but
thats
about
it
without
seeing
what
actual
score
is
from
above
id
give
it
a
2
9
nice
flavor
to
beer
but
didnt
like
the
lack
of
carbonation
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
port
to
a
tee
odd
beer
very
complex
beer
when
cold
heavy
molasses
cherry
and
sherry
dominate
low
carbonation
which
compliment
the
beer
nicely
as
it
warms
the
molasses
takes
a
backseat
but
its
still
in
the
background
leather
aroma
dark
fruit
and
bourbon
presents
itself
fantastic
old
ale
love
it
very
enjoyable
but
a
sipper
for
sure
very
few
beers
can
rival
this
one
in
terms
of
complexity
and
depth
its
downright
enormous
and
is
so
unique
in
the
corded
american
strong
ale
world
i
love
it
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
unselfishly
sharing
yet
another
bottle
of
exceptional
ale
with
me
dark
auburn
in
color
syrup
textured
dead
still
heavily
sedimented
brew
black
cherry
color
to
match
its
added
fruit
intentionally
flat
i
think
maybe
the
carbonic
acid
exposure
over
time
on
a
beer
thats
meant
to
be
cellared
like
this
one
may
denature
or
corrupt
some
of
the
fruit
character
and
smoothness
which
is
why
i
presume
they
didnt
carbonate
it
a
nose
of
medicinal
cherries
over
ripe
black
cherries
and
a
whole
heaping
tone
of
sweet
grain
toffee
and
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
covered
dried
cherry
come
out
in
the
flavor
and
im
amazed
how
little
the
alcohol
shows
up
its
so
thick
too
viscous
and
pushing
gelatinous
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
but
i
dont
want
it
to
have
bubbles
the
decadence
of
the
feel
makes
me
inclined
to
sip
on
it
rather
than
hammer
it
which
allows
it
to
warm
up
and
man
oh
man
does
it
warm
up
beautifully
the
grain
is
never
lost
but
the
cherry
is
dominant
i
think
especially
at
temperature
and
especially
in
the
finish
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
home
spun
booze
infusions
with
fresh
fruit
where
you
forget
about
a
jug
of
whiskey
for
a
few
decades
loaded
with
plums
or
something
very
grandpalike
so
much
texture
its
palate
coating
and
increasingly
cherry
focused
as
it
warms
wonderfully
done
beer
here
like
nothing
else
ive
come
across
in
terms
of
enormity
and
grace
as
much
a
cordial
as
it
is
an
ale
wish
we
could
get
their
beer
in
colorado
i
dont
think
anyone
here
does
beer
quite
like
this
overall
nice
sweet
flavors
mask
the
abv
well
really
nice
aroma
the
carbonation
does
make
a
big
difference
though
overall
a
nice
decedent
beer
the
2014
vintage
is
a
hit
very
much
a
beer
to
sip
and
contemplate
id
compare
it
to
a
liqueur
due
to
its
puny
carb
presence
but
its
much
more
than
a
liqueur
could
ever
be
huge
depth
of
flavor
keen
integration
of
the
cherry
barrel
and
base
beer
flavors
its
hard
to
knock
the
beer
for
something
that
actually
may
help
it
stand
apart
from
others
not
many
beers
are
near
flat
and
most
that
are
fail
to
offer
any
intrigue
yet
cherry
adam
has
such
sharp
vinous
deep
and
rooted
flavors
that
it
delivers
a
near
winelike
spirit
hybrid
type
experience
overall
this
is
an
awesome
take
on
the
base
adam
which
i
just
had
recently
two
days
ago
and
its
on
the
same
level
as
the
base
beer
the
cherries
do
cover
up
a
little
bit
of
the
complexity
that
adam
has
but
at
the
same
time
it
contributes
a
lot
to
the
character
of
the
beer
to
make
it
an
equally
tasty
and
unique
take
on
the
old
ale
would
definitely
love
to
try
adam
from
the
wood
now
which
has
to
be
great
but
not
going
to
worry
too
much
about
getting
my
hands
on
it
when
i
can
more
easily
drink
the
base
adam
m
fully
mouth
coating
creaminess
sticky
but
not
too
sweet
great
take
on
adam
seems
to
be
drinking
perfect
right
now
with
everything
in
balance
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
big
let
down
the
nose
is
pretty
good
the
taste
is
awesome
though
the
lack
of
any
carbonation
hinders
the
flavours
was
quite
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
was
an
enormous
let
down
thanks
to
it
being
completely
flat
overall
despite
the
great
taste
i
cant
stand
a
flat
beer
i
think
at
least
95
of
all
the
flat
beers
ive
drank
have
been
hotd
and
im
pretty
fucking
tired
of
this
shit
especially
for
what
these
clowns
charge
for
their
beer
so
done
with
this
brewery
besides
what
i
have
in
the
cellar
already
overall
really
good
to
great
pretty
much
great
while
it
wont
make
me
wait
in
lines
i
do
understand
why
others
do
worth
a
try
and
i
will
definitely
drop
by
the
taproom
again
to
try
it
again
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
top
10
beers
ive
consumed
a
great
sipper
for
the
colder
weather
that
warms
you
up
thanks
to
ba
airbornebeer
for
this
awesome
brew
very
good
beer
didnt
expect
the
smoke
and
the
cherry
is
subdued
reviewed
1110
o
simply
delicious
everything
works
in
perfect
harmony
and
adam
as
the
base
is
the
perfect
vessel
for
the
barrel
aging
and
the
cherry
sweetness
o
absolutely
fantastic
overall
a
phenomenal
brew
a
pleasure
to
savor
and
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
overall
i
have
had
many
many
hod
beers
and
they
are
almost
always
fantastic
this
beer
completely
blew
me
away
for
some
reason
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
and
just
wanted
to
try
one
of
the
many
wood
beers
they
had
available
very
happy
this
was
the
one
we
chose
the
cherries
and
barrel
aging
come
though
perfectly
and
are
so
well
balanced
i
could
have
drank
this
beer
all
afternoon
if
it
wouldnt
put
me
on
the
pavement
luckily
i
work
5
minutes
from
the
place
and
i
plan
to
visit
again
this
week
verdict
a
very
nice
take
on
adam
a
really
solid
old
ale
as
it
is
but
one
that
might
have
a
little
too
much
going
on
it
has
lots
of
components
from
the
base
beer
the
cherries
and
the
barrels
but
none
of
them
really
seem
to
meld
together
in
harmony
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
over
the
course
of
nearly
an
hour
and
would
do
so
again
but
im
not
convinced
this
is
a
better
version
than
the
base
beer
fuller
body
milder
carbonation
creamy
velvety
and
soft
on
the
tongue
ive
been
waiting
about
3
years
to
try
this
and
it
completely
lived
up
to
or
blew
away
my
expectations
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
encountered
to
date
o
good
not
great
this
beer
imo
is
overhyped
o
really
really
good
flavor
flat
in
this
case
is
ok
but
a
few
bubbles
would
have
been
nice
o
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
it
is
well
worth
your
trouble
thanks
to
tim
for
opening
this
for
us
the
12
vintage
had
a
much
more
smokey
character
than
the
11
a
little
abrasive
up
front
with
less
sweetness
overall
even
with
the
same
big
cherry
flavors
the
booze
was
also
a
bit
heavier
in
the
12
and
had
a
solid
whiskeylike
presence
overall
i
think
i
liked
the
11
better
smoother
and
more
easily
drinking
these
could
honestly
have
been
two
different
beers
but
they
were
still
both
very
tasty
m
full
bodied
but
the
carbonation
thats
there
help
clear
the
palate
very
drinkable
overall
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
night
i
found
the
cherry
a
little
too
dominant
in
the
2012
bottle
which
somewhat
overwhelmed
my
palate
i
actually
preferred
the
more
balanced
and
bourbon
barrel
forward
2011
version
though
im
not
sure
if
that
was
a
batch
difference
a
result
of
aging
or
a
combination
of
both
however
the
relatively
flat
feel
of
the
2011
kind
of
ruined
that
one
for
me
as
well
in
the
end
i
was
happy
to
try
these
especially
sidebyside
but
its
not
one
id
go
after
again
much
preferred
the
regular
adam
and
adam
from
the
wood
cheers
again
for
all
the
stuff
claaark13
this
was
a
piss
load
of
fun
o
interesting
beer
one
i
was
glad
too
try
thanks
greg
youre
the
man
cost
12
for
a
12
oz
bottle
m
medium
body
with
a
huge
chew
light
carbonation
o
takes
adam
to
another
level
each
flavor
compliments
the
others
and
make
this
a
must
have
othe
combination
of
cherries
and
bourbon
was
cool
liked
it
but
didnt
blow
me
away
much
better
than
the
last
bottle
i
had
zero
carbonation
will
hold
on
to
my
2nd
one
for
a
year
or
so
poured
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
brown
ring
sitting
on
top
with
a
very
thin
head
and
left
very
small
bubbles
of
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
plenty
of
sweetness
consisting
of
molasses
toffee
hints
of
caramel
a
little
booze
underlying
cherries
and
signs
of
vanilla
the
cherries
were
more
prominent
on
the
palate
with
great
molasses
toffee
sweetness
a
little
caramel
some
dark
fruit
and
a
little
booze
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
fruity
boozy
and
semi
chewy
finish
great
beer
glad
i
finally
tried
it
this
is
just
crazy
good
delicious
and
so
much
fun
to
drink
thanks
to
trystero
for
a
great
trade
overall
an
undeniably
delicious
complex
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
stuff
this
was
a
great
beer
even
with
quite
the
low
carbonation
level
but
the
2012
vintage
definitely
has
seemed
to
fix
that
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
some
time
does
to
the
2012s
i
have
left
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
no
matter
the
version
you
get
o
this
is
a
very
rich
and
complex
beer
the
cherries
are
quite
subtle
and
are
integrated
well
with
the
base
beer
which
i
wasnt
expecting
it
certainly
beats
the
crap
out
of
some
of
the
big
name
barrelaged
barleywinesold
ales
out
there
overall
i
think
that
i
like
this
better
than
adam
from
the
wood
i
love
it
when
brewers
can
take
a
beer
thats
already
world
classadam
and
make
it
something
special
by
putting
it
into
barrels
hotd
is
no
doubt
a
genius
when
it
come
to
making
really
unique
beers
i
love
how
you
still
know
you
are
drinking
adam
but
with
bourbon
and
cherries
its
nothing
but
stright
up
flawless
execution
by
hotd
on
brewing
barrel
aging
this
beer
overall
wouldve
liked
some
more
complexity
on
the
nose
however
the
taste
is
awesome
and
highlights
the
bourbon
and
the
cherry
flawlessly
o
fantastic
would
be
great
to
reapproach
this
beer
with
a
little
age
on
it
or
alongside
aftw
the
alcohol
is
nice
and
warming
but
doesnt
rear
its
head
and
drinks
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
10
beer
o
well
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
more
like
adam
from
the
wood
with
cherry
than
cherry
adam
and
as
such
the
best
of
the
4
vintages
cherry
adam
is
an
excellent
beer
that
id
happily
drink
5
oz
of
at
any
point
ill
never
turn
this
one
down
d
very
drinkable
the
barrel
aging
and
the
cherries
really
add
some
great
complexity
and
depth
to
the
beer
d
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
how
this
beer
can
get
any
better
its
ready
to
drink
now
and
its
an
outstanding
experience
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
a
full
12oz
bottle
and
the
price
is
a
steal
to
me
this
might
be
my
favorite
beer
overall
oh
how
i
wish
this
had
at
least
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
that
would
make
this
beer
almost
perfect
for
me
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
flawlessly
integrated
flavors
i
cant
get
over
the
cherry
vanilla
and
oak
flavors
they
are
so
real
and
balanced
together
and
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
perfect
beer
tonight
on
this
60s
almost
fall
night
on
the
porch
extremely
impressed
overall
i
am
very
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
but
i
dont
think
i
would
be
actively
seeking
this
out
when
i
can
just
run
to
the
store
and
get
regular
adam
overall
im
sorely
disappointed
here
i
was
really
expecting
quite
a
bit
more
instead
its
muddled
lacking
and
rather
noncohesive
smells
like
black
cherry
and
old
barrels
in
perfect
harmony
complex
and
good
delicious
good
intensity
full
bodied
big
malt
and
fruit
almost
syrupy
but
not
overly
sweet
well
balanced
by
dark
caramel
and
some
fruit
juice
type
tartness
complex
earthy
and
savory
long
finish
nice
good
flavors
but
complete
lack
of
carbonation
dooms
this
one
i
like
my
old
ales
and
stouts
on
the
lowly
carbonated
side
but
this
is
just
ridiculous
it
ruins
a
potentially
great
beer
o
one
of
my
least
favorite
limited
releases
from
hotd
i
love
adam
from
the
wood
so
i
figured
the
addition
of
the
cherries
would
make
this
beer
even
more
fantastic
however
that
is
not
the
case
i
feel
the
cherries
really
didnt
bring
a
whole
lot
too
the
table
three
lack
of
carbonation
doesnt
help
but
i
should
be
used
to
it
with
hotd
beers
by
now
also
this
was
in
someone
elses
possession
between
20092011
so
im
not
exactly
sure
how
it
was
stored
prior
to
my
possession
a
unique
and
awesome
example
of
american
creativity
in
brewing
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
o
really
interesting
beer
lots
going
on
in
the
nose
and
taste
that
makes
it
one
of
a
kind
the
cherries
are
just
enough
to
add
an
awesome
layer
of
complexity
thank
you

very
nice
though
i
significantly
preferred
adam
from
the
wood
d
its
very
unique
the
carbonation
is
really
too
low
here
and
makes
it
drink
more
like
a
red
wine
blend
the
closest
thing
i
can
think
of
is
arctic
devil
but
with
the
stronger
cherry
note
here
i
think
this
stands
out
a
bit
as
my
good
friend
dan
says
you
gotta
pop
that
cherry
hard
overall
a
very
nice
brew
the
most
like
a
dark
red
wine
ive
had
to
date
o
just
not
my
thing
wouldnt
drink
again
im
sure
its
fine
if
you
are
into
cherries
but
i
dont
care
for
it
o
really
delicious
but
unfortunately
another
hotd
beer
that
could
be
elevated
to
phenomenal
with
just
a
little
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
good
but
i
enjoyed
the
base
beer
and
the
regular
wood
version
more
i
would
have
another
though
so
this
beer
says
a
great
deal
about
the
hype
and
screaming
on
ba
this
is
no
more
flat
than
a
couple
of
the
big
lost
abbey
beers
but
nobody
mentions
this
as
an
issue
frankly
for
some
of
their
beers
and
this
one
i
dont
mind
at
all
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
to
savor
thanks
madhombrewer
o
great
beer
fantastic
tasting
sipper
the
flavors
on
this
are
so
good
almost
almost
too
good
said
shortly
it
was
devoured
overall
an
awesome
beer
cherry
adam
from
the
wood
you
have
redeemed
my
faith
in
hair
of
the
dog
o
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
that
may
have
been
let
down
a
bit
although
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
cherries
seem
to
keep
this
beer
from
being
overly
sweet
and
cloying
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
as
this
is
borderline
flat
cheers
o
this
beer
is
extremely
complex
and
really
well
balanced
the
cherry
presence
works
very
well
with
the
base
beer
no
carbonation
but
still
a
truly
unique
beer
drinkability
why
were
there
only
12
oz
of
this
ive
heard
there
are
problems
with
the
2011
batch
that
the
2009
batch
didnt
experience
and
im
grateful
that
i
was
able
to
experience
this
one
as
it
was
intended
the
10
is
felt
but
not
sensed
also
perhaps
the
result
of
an
empty
stomach
which
definitely
contributes
to
the
drinkability
of
this
one
id
certainly
like
to
try
this
one
alongside
regular
adam
from
the
wood
though
i
understand
it
that
that
one
spends
significantly
more
time
barrelside
to
see
what
influence
the
cherries
have
on
this
one
though
im
happy
to
read
in
to
their
influence
wherever
i
can
here
pours
a
dark
burgundy
absolutely
no
head
no
lacong
no
carbonation
either
i
can
literally
count
the
number
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
i
believe
the
2011
batch
must
be
flat
has
strong
cherry
and
oak
notes
on
the
nose
only
a
very
tiny
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
mouth
beyond
sweet
strong
cherry
flavor
is
present
oaky
after
taste
and
a
malty
finish
i
dont
know
what
to
expect
to
age
the
2011
but
im
sure
it
will
need
more
time
for
this
to
settle
nonetheless
this
is
a
nice
beer
this
bottle
of
the
11
batch
traveled
home
with
me
from
portland
along
with
some
of
its
friends
after
chilling
for
about
30
minutes
i
poured
this
into
a
kasteel
chalice
thick
dark
brown
bloody
maroon
with
no
head
to
speak
of
just
a
few
stray
bubbles
around
the
rim
i
would
liked
to
have
seen
a
little
head
on
this
but
considering
the
abv
and
the
contents
i
guess
its
just
not
possible
aroma
heavy
with
black
cherries
raisins
chocolate
booze
bourbonsoaked
oak
taste
was
equally
as
big
with
a
strong
boozy
sensation
right
up
front
followed
by
a
massive
infusing
of
cherries
covered
in
dark
chocolate
enter
midpalate
raisins
and
dried
fruits
grape
skins
and
sherry
following
by
a
drowning
bourbon
sensation
complimented
by
the
barrel
oak
i
was
surprised
at
the
longevity
of
the
dark
chocolate
taste
smooth
and
heavy
mouthfeel
fullbodied
booze
is
tasted
and
felt
wellcrafted
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
and
heavy
with
carbonation
being
almost
nonexistent
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
the
cherries
and
barrel
aging
really
added
some
nice
depth
and
complexity
to
it
that
i
really
liked
it
did
feel
a
little
overly
sweet
and
syrupy
though
at
times
which
prevented
it
from
being
a
really
world
class
beer
to
me
a
little
more
balance
and
just
a
little
carbonation
would
have
gone
a
long
way
dark
plum
purple
no
head
no
lace
looks
like
we
got
a
flat
one
here
folks
super
rich
bourbon
soaked
black
cherries
wet
barrel
wood
and
hint
of
playdough
flavors
are
bit
more
subdued
modest
bourbon
cherry
wood
and
a
touch
of
playdough
in
the
finish
flat
lifeless
body
this
could
have
been
world
class
if
not
for
the
carn
issue
overall
quite
good
but
lack
of
carbonation
is
a
bit
iffy
it
drinks
very
well
for
being
10
smooth
lots
of
great
malt
flavors
nice
fruits
dark
everything
a
bit
too
sweet
imo
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
since
thats
what
it
was
going
for
and
i
dont
usually
have
anything
sweet
the
syrupy
feel
is
ok
but
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
as
well
but
then
again
its
no
dark
lord
if
this
had
even
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
it
would
be
out
of
this
world
big
thanks
goes
out
to
sincerenc
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
reddish
brown
with
basically
no
head
present
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
cherry
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
massive
cherry
subtle
wood
and
a
hint
of
sherry
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
based
on
the
pour
of
this
one
i
was
quite
worried
that
i
wouldnt
like
it
too
much
however
the
aroma
and
flavor
really
pulled
through
on
this
one
despite
it
tasting
pretty
much
flat
it
was
still
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
really
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
and
hopefully
i
will
get
to
do
so
again
in
the
future
tastes
sweet
and
cherry
heavy
i
actually
wish
i
had
opened
this
sooner
not
really
well
carbonated
but
overall
very
enjoyable
owow
just
wow
no
more
words
overall
exxxxceeellllent
hv
overall
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
hotd
beers
but
i
do
love
adam
and
this
one
destroys
the
base
beer
the
beer
is
overall
solid
and
was
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
night
medium
bodied
but
on
the
fuller
end
with
a
very
boost
flavor
that
dominates
slightly
overpowering
the
other
flavors
tons
of
oak
and
peaty
bourbon
folowed
by
the
dark
fruit
notes
hints
of
dark
cherry
fig
raisin
and
currant
give
sweetness
that
counters
toasted
notes
from
the
wood
that
being
said
there
is
a
crazy
amount
of
harsh
boozy
heat
that
makes
it
tough
to
put
down
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
very
light
level
of
carbonation
when
the
bottle
was
first
popped
i
was
a
bit
let
down
to
not
see
any
head
formation
however
after
sipping
the
brew
i
think
it
is
nearly
perfect
and
doesnt
need
any
more
carbonation
the
thickness
of
this
brew
coats
the
mouth
and
lasts
with
a
wonderful
aftertaste
the
10
abv
is
felt
in
the
flavor
but
not
carry
with
it
the
expected
burning
quality
due
to
the
wonderful
mellowing
that
took
place
during
the
barrel
aging
this
brew
was
a
seriously
enjoyable
offering
and
it
is
still
relatively
young
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
o
wow
this
is
a
treat
and
the
perfect
cherry
to
top
the
sunday
of
tasting
beers
that
this
evening
was
this
is
a
dessert
beer
and
one
i
wish
was
readily
available
to
me
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
understand
its
rarity
and
appreciate
the
generosity
in
its
sharing
i
love
the
cherry
flavor
no
candy
here
real
deal
dark
cherries
overall
i
miss
adam
where
is
he
amongst
all
this
cherry
bourbonity
i
remember
the
carbonation
on
adam
being
too
much
but
this
is
the
antithesis
somewhere
in
between
the
base
beer
and
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
creation
o
could
have
been
a
great
beer
but
no
bubbles
completely
ruins
it
for
me
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
but
honestly
im
not
sure
i
could
even
drink
an
entire
bottle
of
it
luckily
there
are
people
to
share
with
pours
an
opaque
crimson
black
with
absolutely
no
head
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
toasted
coconut
raisins
prunes
vanilla
wood
chocolate
and
some
leather
aromas
lots
of
very
nice
smells
coming
off
this
one
taste
is
of
toasted
coconut
vanilla
wood
dark
fruits
cocoa
powder
and
dark
cherries
in
liqueur
very
rich
and
complex
flavors
on
this
one
unfortunately
this
beer
has
no
carbonation
and
is
very
thick
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
suffers
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
my
opinion
i
am
very
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
really
like
this
beer
there
are
similarities
to
port
but
the
combination
of
barrel
malt
and
fruit
is
very
enticing
and
complex
and
a
testament
to
alans
excellent
ability
with
these
sorts
of
beers
lovely
lovely
stuff
the
single
bottle
of
11
in
my
cellar
you
can
buy
08
09
and
11
at
the
tasting
room
but
only
for
consumption
on
the
premises
will
sit
for
at
least
another
year
before
i
crack
it
its
delicious
and
appealing
young
but
its
clear
to
me
that
this
is
a
beer
that
will
reward
patience
are
you
kidding
me
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
lifting
to
my
lips
nothing
short
of
amazing
hope
i
get
another
go
at
this
one
someday
overall
the
lack
of
carbonation
killed
this
and
by
far
the
best
old
alebarleywine
with
a
touch
of
sour
is
the
decadence
recently
released
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
except
along
the
rim
smells
nicely
subtle
and
balanced
with
aromas
of
cherries
vanilla
and
wood
from
the
oak
some
clean
sweetness
a
refreshing
tartness
and
some
cheery
liqueur
at
the
end
the
taste
is
almost
a
perfect
balance
between
rich
lush
sweet
cherries
and
clean
somewhat
tannic
wooden
backbone
with
nice
malt
notes
binding
them
together
and
reminding
you
that
this
is
beer
delicious
truly
a
triumph
of
flavor
just
a
tad
harsh
in
the
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
really
sweet
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
where
i
can
pick
up
mild
tannins
from
the
cherry
wood
i
suppose
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
regular
adam
to
drink
next
to
it
but
alas
i
remember
really
liking
adam
and
only
sort
of
liking
cherry
adam
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
but
only
as
a
side
by
side
pours
dark
brownish
red
with
just
a
tiny
suggestion
of
a
ring
of
head
the
nose
is
fantastic
cherry
and
plum
dominate
with
other
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
just
a
touch
of
leather
wow
the
taste
is
also
great
cherries
and
plums
melded
into
an
old
ale
dark
fruit
raisin
fig
leather
perfectly
the
cherry
flavor
isnt
subtle
but
the
whole
beer
is
so
smooth
and
well
blended
it
is
stunning
not
boozy
at
all
really
brings
this
around
and
counteracts
the
overt
earthiness
of
adam
adding
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
brightness
unfortunately
it
is
basically
flat
with
a
heavy
mouthfeel
it
comes
off
like
a
cordial
a
bit
too
sticky
for
me
overall
this
beer
would
be
unbelievable
with
good
carbonation
as
is
it
is
quite
enjoyable
bottle
says
beer
but
the
pour
looks
like
wine
purple
wine
in
fact
no
head
to
be
found
i
delicately
move
it
around
in
my
glass
smell
is
slight
booze
some
oak
sweet
grape
koolaid
tastes
like
grape
juice
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
zero
carbonation
i
was
a
tad
worried
there
may
be
an
alcohol
burn
but
it
was
non
existent
quite
a
well
done
beer
very
tasty
overall
unfortunately
this
is
another
hair
of
the
dog
beer
that
has
no
carbonation
and
would
be
amazing
otherwise
mouthfeel
is
dissapointing
completely
flat
if
properly
carbonated
this
beer
would
be
exceptional
instead
it
is
merely
excellent
one
of
those
beers
thats
a
treat
just
to
smell
a
whirlwind
of
chocolate
covered
cherries
bourbon
oak
and
the
smoky
leathery
goodness
of
regular
adam
im
somewhat
surprised
that
the
cherry
and
bourbon
flavors
are
so
potent
they
dont
quite
overpower
the
base
beer
but
then
again
adam
in
all
its
leathery
smoky
glory
is
about
as
big
and
badass
a
base
beer
as
youll
find
ive
only
had
2
vintages
of
cherry
adam
but
prefer
the
smoother
integration
the
2008
however
the
2009
is
tasty
stuff
with
a
luxuriously
smooth
and
lingering
finish
highly
recommended
well
despite
its
obvious
differences
to
regular
adam
this
is
in
the
same
goodtoverygood
category
would
like
to
try
this
again
fresher
i
wonder
how
the
cherry
barrels
would
play
without
any
age
on
it
great
flavor
the
lack
of
carbonation
doesnt
destroy
the
experience
but
come
on
alan
give
me
a
little
do
certainly
appealing
this
bourboninfused
strong
ale
becomes
almost
indistinguishable
from
select
barleywines
that
have
received
the
treatment
its
sweetness
sets
the
tone
for
all
that
follows
providing
the
best
and
most
decadent
possible
canvas
for
the
fruit
and
the
spirit
sip
slowly
and
savor
without
distractions
o
a
great
beer
i
didnt
want
this
beer
to
end
overall
impression
so
tasty
and
such
a
great
sipper
exceptionally
done
im
beyond
tickled
to
have
happened
across
this
on
the
one
night
i
was
in
portland
took
the
leap
of
faith
and
ordered
a
28
bottle
of
this
as
my
dessert
beer
on
my
25th
birthday
last
year
i
was
just
hopin
that
it
was
going
to
be
good
im
assuming
the
bottle
i
had
was
from
2009
it
poured
out
as
a
dark
red
color
the
head
was
never
there
no
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
very
winelike
strong
barrel
aromas
blended
with
cherries
and
booze
the
taste
was
a
little
tart
but
had
a
complex
flavor
to
it
from
the
cherry
to
the
wood
and
then
some
nut
flavors
in
the
far
background
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
i
thought
a
little
too
much
like
a
red
wine
the
overall
thoughts
i
had
on
this
beer
was
that
i
didnt
think
it
was
worth
the
amount
i
paid
sadly
i
think
there
are
much
nicer
beers
out
there
other
than
this
for
much
less
however
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
i
dont
see
myself
ordering
this
brew
again
overall
a
very
interesting
take
with
some
really
strong
features
i
would
prefer
a
touch
of
carbonation
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
nonetheless
notes
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
and
i
will
enjoy
this
for
the
remainder
of
my
night
the
mouthfeel
isnt
particularly
strong
if
thats
something
that
is
crucial
for
you
but
honestly
it
is
so
powerfully
complex
it
is
easily
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
just
incredible
overall
this
beer
has
all
kinds
of
things
going
on
from
the
aroma
through
the
taste
knowing
what
this
has
been
through
in
its
aging
doesnt
bother
me
with
the
very
low
carbonation
level
adam
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
this
is
a
really
nice
version
of
it
highly
recommended
just
a
top
notch
beer
really
amazing
the
flavors
all
compliment
each
other
perfectly
nothing
overwhelms
only
adds
to
the
flavor
hard
to
get
but
worth
the
trip
to
the
tasting
room
overall
this
was
amazing
glad
to
have
at
such
a
great
bar
overall
great
beer
would
love
more
carbonation
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
traded
for
it
but
im
not
sure
its
something
i
would
drink
regularly
definitely
more
like
drinking
port
than
beer
this
is
quite
good
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
like
i
wouldve
gotten
as
much
enjoyment
out
of
three
bottles
of
regular
adam
from
2009
6
310
d
no
carbonation
a
touch
sweet
but
i
still
love
it
great
overall
beer
very
delicious
o
frankly
i
dont
think
i
would
like
this
carbonated
so
thats
one
thing
out
of
the
way
but
right
now
this
beer
is
way
way
too
overpowered
with
cherries
hopefully
that
will
start
to
diminish
for
the
positive
though
this
thing
warms
your
soul
just
a
bit
as
it
goes
down
a
scotch
glass
was
definitely
appropriate
this
is
a
wonderful
desert
beer
and
definitely
one
that
demands
your
attention
i
hope
this
review
did
it
justice
overall
it
was
a
slight
disappointment
but
that
disappointment
is
tempered
by
the
experience
of
drinking
a
2009
the
night
before
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
and
im
going
to
try
to
forget
about
it
for
at
least
a
year
in
the
hope
that
it
might
somehow
acquire
at
least
a
modicum
of
carbonation
the
flavors
are
very
interesting
the
cherry
does
come
through
rather
prominantly
and
has
a
large
amount
of
sweetness
behind
it
and
i
think
this
is
why
the
alcohol
is
hidden
rather
well
it
is
detectable
only
in
some
flavors
and
not
so
much
in
heat
the
barrels
come
through
with
some
oak
too
much
not
substantially
so
there
are
alot
of
comparisons
to
a
wine
i
could
make
with
this
actually
but
i
am
not
tomme
pretty
viscous
and
near
syrupy
having
that
carbination
would
cut
it
down
a
bit
basically
how
much
carbination
matters
will
determine
your
enjoyment
think
of
brandy
angles
share
and
decide
the
is
really
enjoyable
as
dessert
with
a
lot
of
complexity
really
a
thick
robust
body
on
this
here
full
and
sticky
with
very
low
soft
carbonation
id
like
a
little
more
from
the
carbonation
but
this
is
still
amazing
overall
an
incredibly
unique
beer
probably
the
most
enjoyable
beer
with
a
dominant
sweet
prescence
a
little
boozey
but
its
not
the
most
aggressive
that
ive
had
i
could
see
how
this
could
be
too
sweet
after
a
while
so
split
your
bottles
with
a
friend
gang
o
a
very
unique
and
tasty
beer
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
it
totally
my
style
of
beer
if
this
had
a
little
carbonation
and
head
it
could
be
near
perfect
overall
a
fine
offering
that
shows
hotd
really
knows
how
to
nail
complex
and
adventurous
beers
o
good
both
vintages
are
tasting
very
good
and
are
enjoyable
as
sippable
beers
some
may
like
the
08
version
better
which
tastes
as
one
would
expect
an
aged
beer
to
tastesomewhat
drier
than
the
freshbut
i
prefer
the
fresher
taste
of
the
11
version
because
i
especially
like
the
fresh
cherry
taste
along
with
the
sugar
but
as
it
is
now
its
a
disappointment
even
more
so
when
i
think
what
it
could
be
overall
glad
i
finally
got
to
sample
this
beer
and
it
pretty
much
lived
up
to
its
billing
will
definately
be
seeking
out
more
bottles
and
age
will
only
improve
this
one
mouthfeeloverall
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
completely
flat
its
very
slick
in
the
mouth
however
it
doesnt
really
affect
the
overall
quality
of
the
beer
much
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
outstanding
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
and
a
superb
take
on
an
ole
ale
o
as
far
as
sipping
beers
go
this
is
near
the
top
so
many
complex
flavors
that
blend
together
magically
this
is
the
perfect
desert
beer
every
little
sip
is
packed
with
so
much
flavor
i
could
spend
all
day
drinking
this
and
discover
something
new
with
every
sip
a
truly
masterfully
crafted
beer
very
unique
with
no
other
beer
tasting
remotely
like
this
amazing
job
here
alan
keep
up
the
great
work
the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
hue
with
minimal
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
fantastic
with
scents
of
cherries
booze
tobacco
brown
sugar
fabulous
the
taste
is
quite
wonderful
as
well
sweet
but
not
overly
so
alcohol
content
is
impressively
well
hidden
delicious
would
be
easy
to
drink
in
large
quantities
terrific
beer
highly
recommended
o
really
disappointed
in
this
years
version
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
took
away
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
one
hoping
the
2009s
i
have
dont
go
this
route
i
dont
think
they
will
o
a
touch
hot
right
now
with
the
very
prominent
sherrybourbon
flavours
but
a
wonderful
sipper
this
beast
is
going
to
only
become
only
better
with
a
couple
years
of
aging
on
it
which
i
would
recommend
o
a
great
experience
but
i
believe
this
will
get
a
lot
better
when
it
has
2
years
on
it
the
lack
of
carbonation
didnt
really
bother
me
on
this
one
drink
i
want
an
iv
of
it
it
was
boozy
creamy
and
sweet
and
and
and
and
so
many
adjectives
2009
bottle
pours
nearly
black
with
almost
no
head
or
at
least
none
that
lasts
more
than
a
fleeting
few
seconds
the
beer
is
a
very
pretty
color
though
in
a
snifter
a
reddish
brown
color
shows
through
but
all
together
its
a
pretty
dark
beer
the
aroma
is
cherry
and
tobacco
with
some
port
some
light
roastiness
and
some
pleasant
bourbony
booze
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
with
a
nice
subtle
smoke
noticeable
throughout
along
with
a
nice
bit
of
wood
and
fruity
cherry
there
is
some
maple
syrup
flavor
and
a
nice
warming
booziness
a
very
different
well
put
together
all
together
unique
and
decadent
beer
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
and
it
smells
heavenly
but
this
is
the
second
hotd
bottle
in
a
row
that
has
been
completely
flat
the
other
being
matt
perhaps
they
use
terrible
bottle
caps
that
dont
hold
up
well
when
being
shipped
i
dunno
but
i
have
to
imagine
that
the
brewer
doesnt
want
their
beer
to
be
completely
absent
of
carbonation
like
this
is
perhaps
it
needs
more
time
in
the
bottle
to
condition
and
get
some
bubbles
whatever
the
case
this
would
be
a
winner
if
it
were
carbed
properly
but
right
now
its
just
an
interesting
cherryinfused
beer
syrup
ill
let
my
other
bottle
relax
in
the
basement
closet
for
about
6
months
and
see
what
happens
but
i
dont
have
high
hopes
similar
flavors
rich
dark
chocolate
tobacco
leather
cherry
tartness
supple
and
mellow
feel
chewy
with
plenty
of
fortitude
bourbon
heat
is
minimal
though
traces
of
the
bourbon
barrel
do
shine
through
in
the
taste
cherries
lend
a
tanginess
in
the
background
while
the
oak
tannins
contribute
a
dry
bitterness
that
linger
in
the
finish
a
slow
sipper
a
fine
after
dinner
nightcap
to
share
with
friends
d
this
is
one
to
sip
given
its
complexity
and
alcohol
content
although
its
well
hidden
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
2009
vintage
pours
a
deep
impenetrable
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
with
no
more
than
a
smattering
of
bubbles
on
top
aromas
of
wet
leather
dried
cherries
oak
and
musty
bourbon
on
the
palate
low
carbonation
and
a
relatively
thick
body
with
flavors
of
bourbon
black
cherries
sherry
and
raisins
warming
and
alcoholic
this
is
a
great
beer
this
is
an
amazing
beer
very
complex
and
incredibly
smooth
especially
for
being
so
fresh
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
d
excellent
smooth
and
rich
the
bourbon
is
a
little
overpowering
right
now
but
this
should
evolve
into
a
wonderful
beer
over
the
next
one
to
five
years
d
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
drinking
every
time
i
have
one
in
my
glass
turn
off
the
tv
block
out
distractions
and
give
yourself
time
to
purely
enjoy
a
great
brewing
achievement
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
those
beers
every
beer
geek
should
try
before
they
die
in
the
world
of
extreme
beer
cherry
adam
defies
the
convential
definition
of
what
a
beer
should
be
ive
had
the
08
09
and
now
the
11
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
one
yet
next
week
when
the
bottles
go
on
sale
the
10
a
bottle
8
33
per
if
you
buy
a
case
price
tag
will
be
the
best
deal
in
town
i
plan
to
buy
a
case
and
see
just
how
long
i
can
keep
from
drinking
the
very
last
bottle
its
a
daunting
task
but
we
all
have
our
crosses
to
bear
i
suppose
55
drinkabilitythis
is
a
very
tasty
beer
still
lots
of
cherry
flavor
present
very
good
beer
very
happy
to
have
finally
tried
it
love
what
the
cherries
did
to
this
guy
very
eager
to
try
it
fresh
im
definitely
going
to
seek
out
some
fresh
ones
if
another
batch
comes
out
wow
to
quote
my
good
friend
i
was
just
floored
by
this
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beer
si
have
ever
had
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
thin
tan
head
exceptional
color
notes
of
bourbon
oak
vanilla
cherries
plums
sherry
port
caramel
and
pecans
such
depth
and
complexity
full
creamy
body
great
finish
db
i
can
smell
and
taste
the
adam
behind
a
nice
bourbon
and
cherry
flavor
set
the
carbonation
missing
is
a
setback
but
i
still
like
this
as
a
dessert
beer
this
was
disappointing
its
tasty
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
leathersmoke
profile
like
the
regular
adam
this
didnt
have
too
much
going
on
p
s
remember
don
younger
low
carbonation
but
still
a
little
bubbly
not
flat
very
very
strong
feeling
definitely
a
sipper
i
found
this
to
be
my
favorite
fotd
beer
to
date
and
best
placed
as
an
afterdinner
or
nightcap
beer
final
thought
i
dont
know
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
right
now
this
beer
was
a
huge
disappointment
was
pretty
excited
to
taste
until
i
took
the
first
sip
and
it
was
all
down
hill
from
there
i
started
drinking
the
beer
a
little
to
cold
but
while
i
drank
it
slowly
and
let
it
warm
up
to
around
5055
f
i
found
myself
giving
it
lower
and
lower
scores
man
and
adam
was
just
so
good
probably
will
have
to
revisit
this
with
another
bottle
just
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
egg
but
as
it
stands
this
sucked
overall
you
must
seek
this
out
its
amazing
and
im
glad
i
live
only
2
5
hours
away
bottle
2009
vintage
poured
into
a
tall
allagash
tulip
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
the
slightest
red
tinges
very
minimal
head
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
with
a
tannish
collared
head
huge
aroma
of
bourbon
in
the
nose
along
with
dark
chocolate
of
the
bes
kind
at
13
5
the
booze
does
show
in
the
nose
slightly
but
not
blatantly
or
displeasing
served
at
cellar
temp
which
is
probably
about
5560
degrees
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
very
bold
and
smooth
flavors
the
like
i
am
extremely
enjoying
dark
chocolate
bourbon
and
dark
fruit
round
out
the
flavor
profile
beautifully
slight
warming
at
the
end
the
smoothness
is
really
nice
i
wish
it
was
a
tad
bit
more
carbonated
though
overall
a
great
beer
this
is
a
complex
well
balanced
and
smooth
beer
worth
trying
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
bottle
pours
deep
brown
with
a
wispy
head
nose
is
hugely
malty
with
heavy
bourbon
and
oak
not
as
smokey
as
a
lot
of
other
of
their
oakaged
beers
hot
sweet
and
a
bit
tart
in
the
mouth
somewhat
medicinal
sweetness
bordering
on
cherry
big
and
robust
malt
more
smoke
or
spice
would
be
nice
to
play
against
the
sweetness
not
cloying
though
pretty
enjoyable
as
it
opens
the
bourbon
and
oak
kind
of
meld
together
very
nicely
that
said
i
think
i
would
just
prefer
the
regular
adam
here
drinkability
sipping
grade
awesomeness
d
this
sure
is
a
sipper
but
it
is
so
flavorful
and
delicious
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
if
it
was
available
world
class

good
but
not
great
an
example
of
a
beer
id
hoped
would
be
better
than
its
inspiration
but
doesnt
quite
deliver
im
thankful
for
the
effort
but
ill
take
the
non
barrel
aged
version
d
i
paid
a
jackson
for
this
baby
was
it
worth
it
from
the
beer
probably
not
but
beachwood
was
my
only
opportunity
and
it
was
my
birthday
so
id
been
eyeing
this
for
a
while
good
beer
without
a
doubt
put
25
years
on
it
it
will
be
amazing
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
do
like
this
beer
especially
the
nose
but
when
you
stack
it
up
against
the
regular
adam
it
falls
a
bit
short
the
cherry
addition
adds
to
the
nose
but
doesnt
do
much
for
me
in
terms
of
flavor
also
seems
like
the
barrel
aging
may
have
thinned
this
one
out
a
bit
however
id
still
like
to
try
the
2009
version
at
some
point
and
this
beer
still
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
old
ales
english
barleywines
overall
its
quite
nice
i
can
see
how
this
one
is
meant
to
be
put
down
or
enjoyed
over
the
course
of
an
evening
with
some
cheese
hair
of
the
dog
only
continues
to
impress
i
admit
im
a
sucker
for
a
well
made
sweeter
littlebitboozy
beer
but
sprints
continues
to
knock
them
out
of
the
park
for
me
really
an
excellent
treat
overall
a
great
beer
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
but
incredibly
quaffable
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
this
one
was
pretty
disappointing
maybe
im
missing
something
but
i
found
this
to
be
too
sweet
too
syrupy
and
a
bit
too
harsh
i
dont
taste
cherries
and
the
flavors
dont
really
work
for
me
i
was
caught
off
guard
with
this
12
oz
bottle
it
poured
like
a
very
weak
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
another
under
carbonated
09
doggy
claws
that
i
got
and
it
was
under
carbonated
but
the
flavors
held
true
i
would
love
to
rate
this
higher
but
it
needs
more
carbonation
and
conditioning
if
that
happened
this
could
possibly
be
one
of
the
best
ales
on
earth
i
love
adam
and
its
my
favored
hotd
brew
also
a
little
bit
of
cocoa
notes
aided
with
masking
the
bitter
bourbonesq
alcohol
flavors
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
had
become
a
little
more
like
red
wine
an
incredible
beer
dthis
is
very
tasty
brew
nice
blend
of
tart
cherry
with
a
good
wood
presence
great
malt
body
to
compliment
the
sweetness
with
an
interesting
almost
tannic
wine
like
quality
i
wish
i
had
a
case
or
two
in
the
basement
too
bad
it
is
so
damn
expensive
dwow
this
is
a
terrific
brew
definitely
in
my
top
ten
easily
i
love
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
more
seek
it
out
and
enjoy
it
d
vastly
superior
to
the
regular
adam
although
i
am
an
unabashed
port
lover
its
a
bit
viscous
and
strong
but
id
drink
it
all
night
without
reservation
the
best
of
the
night
and
easily
an
alltime
favorite
drinkable
may
not
be
the
correct
term
sippable
for
sure
though
easy
to
enjoy
this
one
loads
of
levels
and
flavors
wow
edit
on
tap
last
week
22012
at
the
tap
room
the
chocolatecheery
interplay
is
one
of
the
most
unique
taste
profiles
in
all
of
beerdom
an
absolute
treat
this
2009
version
is
rockin
d
a
deep
and
rich
beer
that
reveals
an
almost
infinite
amount
of
layers
of
flavor
as
i
drink
it
cherry
adam
is
the
real
deal
and
its
a
beer
that
others
in
its
style
should
strive
towards
high
abv
is
a
bit
frightening
at
first
but
its
not
boozy
at
all
and
is
in
fact
super
easy
to
get
down
all
things
considered
seek
it
out
drinkability
so
strong
on
the
bourbon
and
malty
sweetness
its
still
relatively
easy
to
drink
im
impressed
this
is
certainly
a
goody
from
hotd
d
hype
was
bigger
than
what
i
experienced
drinkability
drinkable
and
better
after
it
warms
however
i
never
got
any
cherry
and
prefer
the
brewers
other
old
ales
d
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
i
really
enjoyed
the
mixture
of
cherry
wood
and
vanilla
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
and
would
love
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
dark
brown
with
dark
cherry
highlights
and
a
pink
tinted
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
dark
cherries
and
toasted
oak
with
a
touch
of
buttery
aroma
probably
due
to
malolactic
fermentation
rich
woody
and
full
of
complexity
with
black
cherry
and
toasty
oak
full
bodied
and
silky
with
very
mild
carbonation
long
oaky
finish
this
beer
is
truly
excellent
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
whale
status
d
very
high
ive
got
some
of
this
reserved
at
a
store
i
frequent
and
after
sampling
this
at
dld
i
am
very
excited
to
go
and
pick
my
bottles
up
d
very
good
i
could
drink
more
of
it
d
a
very
nice
and
quite
complex
brew
one
to
sip
and
savor
not
as
good
as
regular
adam
reminds
me
as
much
or
more
of
fred
from
the
wood
as
adam
anyway
overall
a
lovely
beer
and
im
really
glad
i
just
recently
happened
upon
two
more
due
to
the
outstanding
matt
of
capones
cant
wait
to
try
some
with
age
on
them
overall
thus
beer
is
great
very
drinkable
and
probably
the
best
old
ale
i
have
ever
had
well
rounded
with
lots
of
flavor
bourbon
barrels
black
cherries
heaven
while
i
can
polish
off
a
bottle
or
more
of
adam
with
ease
i
think
splitting
this
version
was
a
good
deal
this
was
pretty
sweet
but
not
cloying
in
anyway
maybe
ill
try
to
do
a
bottle
one
day
i
really
cant
say
which
one
i
like
more
this
or
the
regular
but
i
know
this
is
damn
good
stuff
side
by
side
is
in
the
works
d
its
really
drinkable
in
6oz
pours
but
no
way
would
i
want
to
tackle
a
whole
12
i
mean
id
like
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
need
it
all
lovely
flavor
complexity
some
of
the
most
complex
stuff
ive
ever
had
in
fact
baller
shit
from
some
serious
heads
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
never
would
have
guessed
this
is
10
alcohol
quite
sweet
probably
a
bit
too
much
to
session
but
could
do
another
overall
this
was
ok
its
very
similar
to
the
utopias
to
me
its
very
drinkable
for
a
10
beer
its
almost
like
a
after
dinner
drink
however
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
and
there
is
way
to
much
alcohol
taste
and
feel
on
your
mouth
excellent
beer
get
this
mofo
if
yo
cando
interesting
flavor
i
would
have
to
personally
dissagree
with
the
old
ale
label
it
more
likely
resembles
an
american
style
of
quadrupel
huge
raisin
flavor
followed
by
a
cabernet
like
aftertaste
has
low
carbonation
with
a
solid
oak
barrel
aged
like
earthiness
booze
is
pretty
noticeable
medium
to
thick
mouthfeelbody
overall
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
no
where
near
as
bad
as
some
of
the
quadsold
ales
out
there
where
theres
severe
raisin
overkill
just
another
solid
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
d
it
wasnt
quite
worth
the
money
that
we
paid
for
it
but
still
a
fantastic
beer
id
love
to
try
this
again
2008
bottle
pours
like
a
purpledark
maroon
color
very
unique
very
small
head
on
it
but
still
carbonated
some
what
and
a
bit
on
sides
of
glass
but
should
be
expected
especially
aging
over
a
year
in
the
casks
bourbonsherry
big

with
fruit
cherry
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
on
the

taste
wow
very
smooth
with
a
bit
of
smokey
character
expected
from
smell
and
a
nice
cherry
tartness
kind
of
like
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
with
a
smokeywood
addition
a
full
yet
gentle
bodied
brew
with
some
carbonation
and
very
delicious
this
is
a
must
have
and
i
cannot
wait
to
get
more
bottle
vintage
2008
pours
black
cherry
in
color
nearly
black
no
head
to
speak
of
other
than
a
few
clusters
of
bubbles
after
15
months
in
bourbon
and
sherry
casks
though
i
am
feeling
forgiving
on
the
head
a
swirl
does
conjure
up
some
foam
and
stick
some
clusters
of
head
along
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
robust
with
bourbon
black
treacle
brown
sugar
tart
cherry
oak
sherry
and
smokeno
lack
of
complexity
here
the
flavor
begins
with
a
smokey
malt
character
lightened
by
tart
cherries
somewhat
peppery
with
a
dry
bready
finish
that
ends
with
lingering
dark
chocolate
quite
a
brew
full
bodied
with
a
subdued
but
present
carbonation
that
is
just
about
right
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
more
robust
than
expected
and
probably
better
too
something
elegant
to
be
savored
thanks
gary
smells
like
well
the
cherries
are
there
surprise
surprise
some
ripe
apples
too
just
a
general
dark
fruitiness
really
booze
chocolate
and
some
syrupy
sweetness
taste
is
the
same
with
some
charred
malt
and
sweet
flavors
but
a
bit
of
a
woodiness
to
it
fruitiness
is
apparent
throughout
along
with
good
complexity
booze
is
there
in
the
finish
and
somewhat
lingers
without
any
carbonation
to
carry
it
away
though
this
beer
is
properly
carbonated
for
what
its
trying
to
be
the
low
carbonation
and
combination
of
flavors
and
booze
presence
almost
create
a
liqueur
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
and
experience
of
this
beer
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
and
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
down
the
road
i
had
drank
this
once
before
this
review
and
remembered
liking
it
more
so
its
possible
that
my
outlook
will
change
again
in
the
future
thanks
greg
there
was
only
a
prickle
of
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
to
go
with
a
slightly
syrupy
consistency
it
actually
tasted
hotter
than
10
and
it
was
certainly
intended
to
be
shared
this
was
a
beer
i
wanted
to
try
but
i
found
it
hard
to
finish
towards
the
end
d
i
enjoyed
one
bottle
in
two
sittings
and
would
have
had
trouble
doing
it
another
way
d
its
a
big
heavy
beer
but
it
has
so
much
flavor
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
if
i
had
another
bottle
i
dont
think
i
could
let
it
sit
very
long
and
probably
would
opened
it
by
now
what
an
amazing
beer
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
old
ales
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
drinks
pretty
easy
with
nicely
hidden
abv
another
winner
form
hotd
one
that
will
probably
be
better
with
at
least
another
year
on
it
imo
an
interesting
and
masterful
creation
dark

with
virtually
no

drikability
super
tasty
when
it
warms
and
goes
down
easy
one
of
the
besttasting
brews
ive
had
in
2009
d
pretty
big
beer
that
is
very
inviting
the
beer
is
almost
syrupy
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
nottoothick
the
complex
flavors
roll
over
each
other
and
the
alcohol
flavors
seem
to
burst
out
of
the
bourbon
notes
rather
than
an
alcohol
burn
after
a
few
sips
i
feel
the
alcohol
warm
my
stomach
pleasantly
reminding
me
that
this
is
a
sipper
but
the
flavors
mask
the
high
abv
nicely
i
am
really
impressed
by
this
beer
and
will
seek
it
out
in
the
future
no
carbonation
really
hurts
the
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
this
beer
is
a
warming
top
notch
behemoth
overall
awesome
beer
really
really
great
highly
recommended
a
huge
thanks
to
jedwards
for
breaking
this
one
out
batch
1
served
in
my
allagsh
tulip
poured
the
color
of
cola
with
rubyred
highlights
around
the
edges
head
was
a
light
skim
of
foam
that
quickly
dispersed
into
nothingness
incredible
nose
lots
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
taste
follows
nose
bourbon
with
some
tart
cherries
coming
out
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
a
little
oily
with
a
carbonation
level
that
was
pretty
darn
close
to
still
and
a
mild
tartness
that
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
incredibly
flavorful
with
a
wellhidden
abv
my
first
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
has
left
me
wanting
more
thank
to
ba
kplynch
for
this
gem
drinkability
is
high
in
regards
to
desire
to
drink
but
i
would
be
lying
if
i
said
my
stomach
wasnt
rumbling
after
6
oz
perhaps
its
because
i
havent
ate
enough
today
this
bottle
is
an
awesome
dessert
or
nightcap
awesome
beer
on
par
with
both
regular
adam
and
matt
seek
this
one
out
extra
from
hophead84
pretty
decent
extra
i
guess
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
body
with
a
small
tan
head
that
clings
strongly
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
an
interesting
mix
of
bourbon
leather
and
pipe
tobacco
with
a
touch
of
tart
cherry
i
was
expecting
a
cherry
onslaught
but
thats
not
the
case
the
fruit
is
just
another
layer
in
a
very
complex
beer
the
taste
is
similar
with
bourbon
up
front
lending
vanilla
caramel
and
light
tannins
leather
and
tobacco
follow
with
cherries
appearing
midpalate
simultaneously
sweet
and
tart
leading
into
a
dry
earthy
finish
incredible
complexity
on
display
here
another
great
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
drinkability
is
average
its
a
wonderful
beer
but
also
a
big
challenge
to
put
back
cheers
feels
dense
as
hell
yet
smooth
to
sip
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
a
really
well
done
beer
notei
am
putting
alot
of
faith
in
the
aging
process
of
this
beer
because
i
plan
on
sitting
on
a
couple
of
them
for
a
while
d
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
i
would
search
for
this
and
drink
again
my
only
gripe
is
the
low
level
of
carbonation
which
really
does
the
nose
a
disservice
i
would
like
to
see
what
this
beer
would
taste
like
served
incredibly
cold
as
i
feel
that
may
take
away
a
bit
of
the
tartness
and
possibly
give
the
cherry
flavor
a
bit
more
of
a
chance
i
would
also
like
to
see
how
this
tastes
after
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
i
will
have
to
try
both
i
am
not
quite
too
sure
about
the
cherry
part
of
this
beer
there
is
a
general
fruity
richness
but
certainly
not
anything
i
can
identify
as
cherry
specific
this
could
use
a
bit
more
texture
and
heft
a
bit
more
residual
malt
character
in
the
body
would
help
to
smooth
out
the
warm
boozy
alcohol
and
spicy
barrel
notes
seems
to
lack
a
bit
of
finesse
and
the
flavors
aromas
are
not
quite
as
integrates
as
one
might
hope
still
this
is
certainly
a
tasty
beer
and
i
like
how
the
background
sherry
notes
add
a
lot
of
richness
to
this
beer
the
smoky
peat
character
also
adds
a
lot
of
background
complexity
to
this
beer
smell
is
very
nice
a
good
amount
of
cherry
is
in
the
nose
kind
of
shocked
didnt
expect
that
much
some
hints
of
oak
and
bourbon
taste
is
phenomenal
im
a
big
fan
of
hotd
adam
to
begin
with
but
this
takes
it
to
a
whole
other
level
the
cherry
really
works
well
with
the
base
beer
when
this
warms
up
after
a
bit
the
cherry
subsides
slightly
and
the
oak
vanilla
and
the
bourbon
characteristics
really
come
forward
and
shine
this
is
like
two
completely
different
beers
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
world
class
beer
once
it
warms
up
and
starts
to
flourish
full
and
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
this
one
coats
the
mouth
with
heavenly
goodness
and
you
never
want
to
see
the
glass
empty
this
one
not
only
lived
up
to
but
exceeded
my
expectations
im
going
to
have
to
try
to
find
some
more
of
this
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
beer
was
huge
for
me
i
try
to
appreciate
all
beers
but
the
one
style
that
i
dont
really
care
for
are
old
ales
for
me
to
give
the
review
i
did
for
an
old
ale
says
something
i
never
thought
a
beer
from
this
style
could
taste
as
great
as
this
one
did
kudos
to
alan
sprints
for
creating
this
one
drinkability
ok
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
and
thick
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
aggressive
pour
yields
a
paper
thin
layer
of
head
that
quickly
disappears
to
a
few
bubbles
here
and
there
nothing
in
terms
of
lacing
unfortunately
the
beer
itself
is
essentially
black
as
night
smell
has
a
strong
malt
character
with
molasses
leather
and
tobacco
dark
ripe
cherries
oak
and
gooey
fudge
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
begins
with
tart
cherries
rich
caramel
and
some
smokey
wood
midway
the
fudge
flavors
emerge
with
some
tobacco
leaves
and
bourbon
aftertaste
is
sweet
with
vanilla
beans
leather
and
some
coffee
flavors
as
well
full
body
with
a
silky
smooth
feel
from
the
almost
nonexistant
carbonation
the
booze
is
present
making
this
one
a
sipper
for
sure
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
highly
talked
about
beer
thanks
again
dano
you
little
bitch
drinkability
is
good
very
complex
and
tasty
a
one
of
a
kind
and
fun
to
decipher
but
the
fact
is
its
a
very
strong
robust
super
oaky
beer
and
since
i
assume
a
lot
of
the
boozy
bite
is
from
the
sherry
im
not
sure
how
much
it
will
smooth
out
in
the
cellar
plus
its
very
expensive
1012
oz
iirc
ive
got
a
bunch
of
them
so
well
see
how
they
hold
up
in
the
cellar
but
honestly
ill
probably
have
to
pimp
a
few
as
trade
fodder
another
great
beer
from
hotd
and
while
this
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
the
original
adam
for
me
the
twists
definitely
make
for
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
bottle
poured
a
deep
black
color
ale
with
some
reddish
notes
and
alight
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
bourbon
and
light
cherry
with
a
well
rounded
malt
backbone
taste
is
very
complex
mix
of
bourbon
cherries
smoke
and
tar
with
a
heavy
dose
of
sweet
malt
full
body
with
limited
filtration
and
no
carbonation
and
almost
no
carbonation
very
complex
and
very
satisfying
another
great
beer
coming
from
a
very
creative
brewer
a
nice
sipper
pretty
much
turns
into
cherry
scotch
near
the
middle
of
the
glass
and
stays
there
an
interesting
beer
i
might
try
this
again
sometime
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
mellow
carbonation
perfect
body
makes
for
great
drinkability
such
a
very
good
beer
cheers
to
hair
of
the
dog
for
another
beautiful
creation
and
thanks
to
autumnaldave
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
the
brew
a
lot
when
cold
the
cherry
and
wood
really
dominated
and
the
tartness
was
awesome
as
it
warmed
the
tobacco
really
came
out
and
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
cherry
skoal
now
i
know
that
doesnt
sound
a
lot
like
a
ringing
endorsement
but
its
good
very
good
big
thanks
to
toby
for
the
generosity
taste
strong
cherry
and
bourbon
right
out
of
the
gate
balanced
by
some
sweetness
some
vanilla
and
chocolate
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
10
barrel
aged
offering
this
is
as
complex
as
one
might
imagine
given
the
brewery
the
name
and
the
fact
this
is
an
adulterated
version
of
an
already
complex
and
wonderful
old
ale
as
with
most
barrelaged
versions
id
personally
rather
have
the
original
but
this
is
still
fantastic
thank
you
very
much
msubulldog25
overall
would
love
to
get
one
for
the
cellar
flavor
is
better
cigar
wrapper
sweet
and
tobacco
leathery
the
cherries
add
a
nice
dimension
but
are
pretty
much
blown
away
by
oak
and
catchers
mitt
the
cherries
and
oak
add
a
very
nice
depth
i
think
it
will
get
better
with
quite
a
bit
of
age
but
still
drink
one
when
you
can
to
try
it
alan
is
a
homebrewers
brewer
not
every
batch
is
gonna
be
stellar
though
if
he
did
start
filtering
and
counterpressure
bottling
wouldnt
that
take
away
from
some
of
the
allure
that
said
ive
had
plenty
of
carbonation
issues
with
hotd
brews
but
overall
the
brews
flavor
are
damn
near
always
fantastic
i
am
very
happy
i
am
cellaring
a
bottle
overall
a
great
beer
a
must
try
let
it
warm
up
for
a
while
to
help
bring
out
the
complexity
of
the
taste
this
beer
definitely
deserves
this
patience
from
you
i
really
want
to
have
this
again
hopefully
it
will
come
out
in
bombers

thanks

thanks
to
sam
for
a
couple
bottles
of
what
proves
to
be
another
winner
from
hotd
d
its
aged
adam
with
a
dose
of
wood
and
cherry
if
youre
an
adam
fan
this
is
a
must
a
warming
rich
sipping
beer
that
makes
a
great
dessert
on
a
chilly
night
complex
and
still
boozy
its
great
to
try
now
and
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
develops
over
time
recommended
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
needs
a
little
bit
more
carbonation
but
again
i
have
to
say
this
one
comes
across
excellent
another
winner
here
and
i
am
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
despite
the
one
minor
flaw
this
is
an
excellent
brew
drinkability
is
great
im
wishing
i
had
several
bottles
more
that
i
could
just
keep
sipping
on
this
is
well
balanced
with
a
great
depth
from
the
barrel
and
the
cherries
its
far
from
obtrusive
and
truly
complimentary
great
stuff
must
fine
more
pours
a
cloudy
and
murky
dark
reddish
brown
very
muddy
very
thin
tan
head
forms
immediately
settles
down
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
but
drops
some
nice
lacing
when
i
swirl
the
glass
good
retention
smell
is
crazy
like

is

very

great
beer
super
complex
still
has
the
components
of

but
amped
up
a
bit
very
nice
thanks
derek
thanks
to
inflatablechair
for
this
one
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
bottle
conditioned
2008
vintage
poured
brown
with
hints
of
red
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
what
head
there
is
quickly
dissipates
great
aroma
with
bourbon
vanilla
oak
fruit
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
full
bodied
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
made
it
a
bit
syrupy
very
rich
complex
malt
profile
more
oak
and
chocolate
lots
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
long
woody
finish
a
bit
of
tart
cherry
flavor
but
not
a
lot
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
diminished
the
beer
to
me
major
gusher
quickly
diminishing
thin
foam
brown
body
poor
appearance
nose
has
some
character
to
it
with
a
touch
of
smoke
black
cherries
and
sherry
notes
very
thin
mouth
feel
notes
of
black
cherry
smoke
and
sweet
ripe
dark
fruit
a
solid
ale
but
was
expecting
a
bit
more
here
a
good
beer
that
i
hope
gets
better
with
some
more
time
in
the
bottle
right
now
i
would
take
regular
adam
over
this
one
though
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
brown
edges
and
a
smaller
sized
red
tinted
off
whtie
head
aromas
of
darkblack
cherries
wood
sherry
and
light
bourbon
i
would
say
the
woodiness
dominates
the
aromas
with
the
black
cherries
coming
in
a
close
second
tastes
of
black
cherries
sherry
wood
chocolate
vanilla
and
caramel
sweet
if
a
very
light
tart
finish
more
sweet
and
the
tartness
dissapeared
as
soon
as
i
detected
it
light
to
medium
alcohol
in
the
finish
pours
basically
black
with
no
lasting
head
whatsoever
just
some
beige
bubbles
kicked
up
from
the
pour
but
not
a
real
head
smell
is
smooth
and
rich
bourbon
and
oak
mainly
and
is
quite
nice
taste
is
a
touch
tart
and
perhaps
fruity
but
not
cherries
per
se
and
of
course
some
bourbon
and
definite
wood
character
tart
fruity
malt
flavor
but
only
a
very
faint
actual
cherry
flavor
even
when
looking
for
it
some
very
light
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
its
a
touch
warming
beer
is
flat
after
5
minutes
in
the
glass
which
kills
the
beer
for
me
and
once
again
another
overpriced
and
over
hyped
hotd
beer
with
a
huge
bottling
flaw
at
about
15
dollars
for
a
12
ounce
bottle
plus
shipping
this
is
ridiculous
this
is
not
something
i
would
buy
again
if
it
were
3
bucks
maybe
this
one
needs
to
lie
down
for
a
few
months
so
that
the
yeast
can
work
a
little
longer
very
unique
and
smooth
for
all
that
is
going
on
here
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
very
little
head
very
low
carbonation
has
a
huge
aroma
the
cherry
is
obvious
along
with
a
nice
bourbon
oak
notes
taste
has
some
nice
oak
chocolate
tobacco
and
yes
black
cherry
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
for
such
a
strong
beer
nice
its
preety
tasty
drinkability
is
good
except
for
the
cost
a
nice
treat
12
oz
bottle
from
bottle
trek
pours
murky
brownmahogany
very
small
off
white
ring
in
the
glass
aroma
is
wood
booze
tart
fruit
and
maybe
a
hint
of
cherries
flavor
is
very
full
sherry
like
too
much
booze
in
the
flavor
with
some
tartness
and
tobacco
i
like
the
regular
better
many
thanks
to
vwcraig
for
giving
me
the
hookup
on
hotd
beers
or
i
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
try
this
this
gushed
despite
being
properly
chilled
which
is
always
a
disappointment
with
expensive
beers
but
i
didnt
lose
much
it
looks
nice
dark
blackbrown
no
head
red
edges
it
smells
like
wood
barrels
liquor
alcohol
very
interesting
the
flavor
has
a
leather
quality
that
i
get
from
regular
adam
the
slightest
touch
of
tartness
but
i
couldnt
pinpoint
it
as
a
cherry
flavor
this
was
pretty
good
but
im
not
sure
id
pick
this
up
again
given
the
price
and
the
fact
that
i
just
prefer
fred
and
doggie
claws
over
adam
as
a
rule
i
do
have
one
bottle
left
to
cellar
so
well
see
how
that
goes
51611
was
fortunate
enough
to
sample
the
2011
at
the
tasting
room
and
then
later
back
home
in
owings
mills
was
told
the
abv
in
this
excellent
beer
is
now
up
around
13
and
frankly
it
shows
still
this
beer
has
so
much
flavor
just
an
incredibly
intense
flavor
of
chocolate
and
cherry
the
alcohol
is
still
very
much
in
the
background
i
should
add
that
the
2011
version
is
completely
still
no
appreciable
carbonation
which
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
fantastic
stuff
poured
from

well

is

in

like
presences
i
like
the
low
carbonation
on
the
beer
at
times
but
believe
that
a
slighty
increased
co2
level
would
of
increased
both
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
however
this
is
minor
to
how
stellar
this
beer
is
and
i
think
that
it
should
age
nicely
love
this
beer
pours
with
a
larger
head
this
time
with
better
retention
the
flavors
have
blended
together
nicely
over
the
nearly
nine
months
since
i
last
had
this
chocolate
notes
have
come
out
and
they
blend
very
nicely
with
the
bourbon
and
cherries
notes
of
vanilla
and
a
prominent
smokiness
have
become
apparent
as
well
the
booze
has
died
down
a
bit
without
losing
any
of
the
nice
bourbon
and
cherry
notes
the
carbonation
has
increased
slightly
providing
a
fuller
mouthfeel
which
is
decidedly
chalky
at
times
this
is
coming
along
nicely

about

all

a

o
adam
certainly
deserves
its
high
ratings
even
after
7ish
years
in
the
bottle
it
holds
up
and
maybe
has
improved
since
being
fresh
great
complexity
and
balance
along
with
a
scary
drinkability
for
a
10
beer
this
ranks
right
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorite
strong
ales
great
stuff
glad
i
have
more
of
this
batch
to
savor
in
the
future

overall
a
delicious
beer
drinks
dangerously
smooth
tasty
complex
and
satisfying
but
not
overwhelming
in
any
sense
rich
and
delicious
look
forward
to
putting
some
years
on
this
one
seriously
happened
to
stumble
on
this
one
at
the
tap
room
right
as
it
was
put
on
we
had
no
frickin
clue
about
the
brewery
itself
let
alone
what
this
beer
was
all
about
it
was
mindblowing
but
it
was
also
the
top
of
the
keg
i
went
back
the
next
day
and
it
was
gone
they
laughed
when
we
were
surprised
o
this
is
a
unique
strong
ale
and
very
enjoyable
i
look
forward
to
my
next
hotd
brew
way
too
sweet
far
from
the
mellow
characteristic
expected
of
the
style
unfinished
fermentation
young
batch
upon
opening
the
bottle
and
pouring
the
first
little
bit
i
was
nervous
as
the
carbonation
was
so
thick
and
high
that
i
thought
i
had
gotten
a
bad
bottle
after
about
5
minutes
the
carb
receded
and
lingered
around
the
top
like
a
crown
dark
in
appearance
and
displayed
a
wonderful
aroma
of
brown
sugar
molasses
and
raisins
this
was
very
reminiscent
of
sucre
in
its
body
and
flavors
at
10
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
i
need
to
grab
a
few
more
bottle
of
this
on
my
next
purchase
a
wonderful
old
ale
that
is
worth
drinking
over
and
over
and
if
youve
never
had
it
go
and
find
it
i
promise
you
will
not
be
disappointed
overall
great
beer
overall
bold
flavorful
complex
and
a
tiny
bit
boozy
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
hidden
a
bit
better
poured
into
a
teku
dark
brown
and
murky
with
no
head
smell
up
front
is
smoke
a
dark
fruits
raisins
figs
a
hint
of
cherry
skin
getting
a
lot
of
smoke
in
the
taste
its
a
subdued
smoke
not
like
a
rauch
or
anything
but
its
definitely
there
was
not
expecting
it
and
it
overshadows
some
of
the
other
flavors
no
carb
issue
here
as
it
warms
some
of
the
dark
fruit
caramel
burnt
sugar
flavor
is
coming
out
super
complex
this
might
have
gone
over
my
head
worth
a
try
for
sure
ill
try
some
with
some
age
on
it
see
how
that
compares
overall
to
this
point
this
is
my
favorite
edition
of
the
style
i
like
it
a
lot
id
had
fred
and
was
a
bit
nonplussed
likewise
blue
dot
thought
it
was
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
unless
you
consider
ba
home
because
i
think
i
did
write
a
review
but
thats
silly
who
would
make
that
comparison
maybe
the
intervening
years
really
have
matured
my
palate
maybe
im
just
amped
on
america
and
puppies
either
way
adam
really
stood
out
to
me
as
an
excellently
crafted
work
of
gustatoryzymurgical
art
and
i
can
fully
understand
the
hype
around
aftw
and
caftw
even
though
i
havent
had
and
probably
never
will
get
to
taste
either
since
ive
not
had
it
fresh
i
cant
speak
to
how
its
changed
over
the
years
this
ones
only
about
two
years
old
but
rest
assured
after
this
bottle
ill
certainly
be
picking
a
couple
more
up
when
i
see
them
to
test
that
question
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
od
pretty
hardcore
age
has
probably
mellowed
this
out
a
bit
but
the
smoke
is
a
touch
too
much
for
me
its
quite
a
complex
adventure
though
and
quite
rich
a
decent
example
but
nothing
too
wild
i
really
dig
the
bold
and
complimentary
flavors
in
this
one
beautiful
depth
of
flavors
working
cohesively
here
im
not
a
particularly
slow
drinker
but
it
was
easy
to
enjoy
this
over
several
hours
very
nice
sipper
batch
90
o
overall
is
that
this
beer
is
incredibly
complex
yet
not
overwhelming
to
your
taste
because
it
is
so
well
harmonized
so
well
crafted
this
is
a
beer
you
just
need
to
try
i
might
need
to
go
down
to
the
brewery
and
try
this
one
on
tap
its
worth
another
chance
its
solidly
good
but
not
my
favorite
ive
had
other
hotd
beers
that
ive
liked
better
than
this
one
it
would
be
improved
with
a
little
less
forward
alcohol
astringency
and
a
little
more
character
in
the
body
overall
was
expecting
more
of
a
similarity
to
a
barley
wine
since
it
was
labeled
as
old
ale
i
found
it
to
be
more
similar
to
a
tripel
or
quad
which
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
still
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
easy
to
pick
out
which
makes
it
enjoyable
i
love
dogs
o
one
of
the
best
in
class
enjoyable
throughout
the
temperature
range
makes
me
want
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
overall
an
odd
offbeat
beer
the
lack
of
head
on
a
vigorous
pour
hints
that
something
was
not
quite
right
with
my
sample
the
aroma
and
taste
was
unique
and
sweet
indeed
a
desert
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
o
this
beer
is
big
smooth
and
complex
its
really
good
as
well
and
im
sure
this
after
some
time
in
a
barrel
is
like
heaven
overall
this
has
been
a
beer
i
have
been
wanting
for
a
long
time
and
was
happy
to
receive
one
as
an
extra
certainly
lived
up
to
what
i
had
made
it
out
to
be
in
my
mind
great
example
of
a
staleish
and
leathery
old
ale
overall
very
impressive
strong
ale
very
complex
with
a
pleasing
mixture
of
flavours
that
on
their
own
would
not
be
particularly
appealing
but
this
mishmash
of
flavours
comes
together
to
create
a
mix
of
stoutlike
smoked
porterlike
and
english
old
alelike
characteristics
all
in
one
12oz
bottle
very
good
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
for
a
late
winterearly
spring
evening
lots
of
depth
though
some
oxidation
notes
too
plenty
of
sweetness
though
not
so
much
on
the
leather
notes
i
dont
know
enough
about
dark
dortmunders
to
say
if
this
comes
close
but
its
a
solid
dark
ale
with
some
belgian
characteristics
deep
brown
to
nearly
black
in
color
a
faint
bit
of
khaki
colored
head
rests
on
top
brussels
lacing
is
evident
i
get
a
strong
aroma
of
plums
and
figs
along
with
with
alcohol
the
mouth
is
sticky
warm
due
to
the
alcohol
the
taste
is
strong
with
a
bit
of
a
vinous
note
and
loads
of
dark
malt
the
finish
is
on
the
sweeter
side
due
to
the
heavy
amount
of
dark
malt
pours
deep
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
good
frothy
mocha
colored
head
dies
down
to
a
fine
lacing
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
herbaceous
hops
liquorice
raisin
dates
figs
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
smoke
leather
flavor
follows
the
aroma
medium
sweet
to
begin
with
molasses
sweet
dark
fruits
malt
loaf
etc
and
a
dark
chocolate
bittersweet
flows
before
the
spicy
hop
bitterness
hits
giving
a
nice
savory
kick
medium
bodied
with
a
sticky
texture
good
pleasant
soft
natural
carbonation
helps
to
coat
the
tongue
leading
to
a
very
satisfying
bitter
sweet
sticky
long
finish
pretty
great
stuff
would
looove
the
from
the
wood
version
o
overall
a
tasty
old
ale
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
distracting
though
which
is
too
bad
o
perhaps
not
as
exemplary
as
i
had
anticipated
but
good
nonetheless
the
flavor
and
in
particular
the
aroma
get
better
as
the
liquid
warms
ive
typically
complained
about
old
ales
which
i
will
admit
is
unfair
to
the
style
or
perhaps
not
because
i
dont
dislike
this
it
definitely
tastes
old
but
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
its
a
nice
sipper
with
some
interesting
dark
malts
dark
fruit
and
booze
overall
great
beer
if
for
sure
lived
up
to
the
hype
if
i
didnt
have
to
wake
up
early
i
would
consider
doing
this
side
by
side
with
the
4d
i
have
in
the
fridge
o
well
i
will
be
out
in
portland
in
a
few
months
hope
i
can
find
a
few
to
bring
back
home
and
see
how
it
does
with
some
more
aging
and
to
have
a
fresh
go
at
it
we
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
of
batch
89
in
to
two
pint
glasses
the
appearance
was
very
dark
in
color
almost
colalike
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
we
found
the
malty
aroma
inviting
despite
having
very
little
hops
or
yeast
we
could
detect
figs
and
chocolate
and
it
smelled
very
sweet
and
slightly
boozy
the
taste
was
amazingly
complex
with
smoke
leather
and
dark
fruit
the
nose
definitely
belied
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
medium
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
so
would
i
we
have
it
again
hell
yes
o
recommended
but
perhaps
a
bit
overrated
id
love
to
try
adam
from
the
wood
othis
is
a
nice
beer
the
flavors
are
complex
and
intense
while
this
is
certainly
a
sweet
big
beer
unlike
many
beers
of
this
style
and
abv
adam
never
veers
into
syrupy
or
sticky
i
especially
enjoy
the
cherry
fruit
flavors
and

bitter
twang

overall
a

old
ale
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
as
far
as
im
concerned
o
friggin
delicious
so
smooth
for
10
could
easily
drink
several
in
a
row
pours
very
dark
brown
with
the
edge
showing
some
translucence
smell
is
strong
on
the
figs
and
a
little
rubbery
bandaid
smell
funny
i
saw
someone
else
refer
to
the
bandaid
smell
mine
is
from
sucking
on
my
injured
finger
some
30
years
when
they
made
em
out
of
that
rubbery
stuff
and
the
taste
was
very
distinctive
ive
gotten
it
most
in
stones
vanilla
and
chipotle
porters
but
anyway
the
taste
has
a
little
of
the
belgian
yeast
and
lots
of
the
bandaid
twisty
funky
bitterness
i
truly
am
surprised
by
the
super
high
ratings
as
i
do
not
feel
it
merits
them
and
hence
the
wonder
if
bouncing
it
off
the
tile
hampered
it
any
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
alcohol
presence
which
at
10
is
deservedly
so
to
a
certain
degree
i
suppose
im
just
a
little
disappointed
reading
all
the
high
reviews
finally
finding
one
of
these
guys
and
not
being
very
impressed
with
it
its
not
bad
and
its
very
decent
considering
the
high
abv
but
i
probably
was
expecting
too
much
overall
a
stunning
ale
that
pushes
the
boundaries
of
the
craft
for
such
a
sweet
beer
it
is
unbelievably
drinkable
dangerously
so
hair
of
the
dog
has
officially
blown
my
mind
o
leaving
at
4
overall
i
sensed
an
amount
of
improvement
in
the
nose
and
cohesiveness
of
flavor
still
packs
quite
a
punch
overall
a
solid
old
ale
that
i
would
buy
more
often
if
available
to
me
o
4
5
this
is
a
really
fine
beer
i
actually
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
than
i
did
for
fred
and
while
this
one
is
really
good
fred
is
the
luscious
winner
in
my
book
but
its
apples
and
oranges
i
guess
and
this
is
still
a
very
interesting
beer
and
its
complexity
and
composition
are
worthy
of
the
hair
of
the
dog
name
pros
those
guys
among
the
very
best
while
ive
had
a
handful
of
more
delicious
beers
though
this
is
delicious
what
this
beer
has
is
complexity
i
mean
things
are
happening
in
your
mouth
different
things
at
different
times
an
interplay
between
flavor
elements
and
mouthfeel
elements
its
a
journey
thats
what
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
overall
ive
only
had
one
other
old
ale
and
it
was
similar
but
different
to
adam
both
were
good
so
i
think
i
may
have
to
seek
out
more
of
this
style
hopefully
they
all
display
the
same
balance
and
complexity
ov
a
great
beer
and
if
the
alcohol
was
better
hidden
id
have
rated
this
higher
the
flavours
are
there
but
the
heat
punches
through
a
bit
too
much
for
my
preference
taking
away
from
the
smoothness
its
only
10
abv
but
drinks
like
its
at
least
12
otherwise
very
very
enjoyable
had
on
tap
at
the
source
this
is
a
world
class
old
ale
from
hair
of
the
dog
actually
this
is
a
world
class
ale
of
any
sorts
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
i
would
order
it
by
the
truckload
anxious
to
try
other
batches
cheers
people
overall
this
is
a
truly
remarkable
brew
never
had
anything
like
this
and
i
really
dig
it
highly
recommended
overall
an
enjoyable
complex
old
ale
by
hair
of
the
dog
all
the
flavours
are
on
par
for
the
style
and
definitely
an
easysipping
beer
overall
just
a
great
beer
take
your
time
sipping
it
because
it
will
give
you
a
nice
buzz
after
just
one
very
drinkable
and
tastes
better
everytime
i
have
it
completely
unique
with
its
flavor
hotd
just
knows
how
to
do
some
things
better
than
others
and
this
beer
is
one
of
their
best
balanced
and
complex
and
something
any
beer
enthusiast
should
try
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumhigh
intensity
which
manages
to
foam
the
beer
quite
quickly
on
the
palate
but
never
causing
it
to
feel
fizzy
ethanol
can
be
felt
in
the
nostrils
and
back
of
the
throat
closes
semidry
with
substantial
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
after
each
sip
very
interesting
beer
bit
of
a
sipper
not
sure
i
can
say
ive
had
anything
like
this
before
o
this
was
another
fantastic
beer
from
hotd
and
is
easily
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
nonba
old
ales
ive
had
there
was
a
ton
of
complexity
but
still
remained
very
flavorful
with
an
insane
drinkability
this
makes
a
perfect
afterdinner
desert
beer
and
id
love
to
see
how
this
ages
however
it
is
perfect
drinking
right
now
with
less
then
a
year
on
it
if
you
like
complex
old
ales
with
a
ton
of
flavor
i
definitely
recommend
checking
this
out
i
see
why
this
beer
is
a
prime
candidate
for
aging
i
was
not
really
expecting
what
i
got
but
i
do
love
the
flavors
going
on
here
an
incredibly
roasty
and
flavorful
beer
cheers
pours
a
murky
brown
capped
by
a
very
light
beige
silky
but
fluffy
one
and
half
finger
head
fantastic
retention
plenty
of
splotchy
lacing
grain
fig
dates
bakers
chocolate
and
toffee
on
the
nose
dark
chocolate
notes
rich
fig
combined
with
caramel
notes
and
grain
finishes
with
added
hints
of
leather
and
boozy
alcohol
slick
but
creamy
and
velvety
mouthfeel
truly
fantastic
simply
an
exceptional
beer
if
it
wasnt
10
id
crack
another
for
sure
overall
completely
unique
much
more
of
a
cold
weather
brew
but
i
dont
care
i
have
to
try
the
adam
from
the
wood
now
batch
79
o
great
old
ale
must
find
aftw
o
very
enjoyable
sipper
a
lot
of
flavor
and
deep
character
coming
from
this
beer
o
a
sophisticated
drink
that
might
pair
well
with
cigars
and
smoking
jackets
in
a
formidable
leather
wing
back
chair
with
your
hounds
in
front
of
a
crackling
fire
recounting
that
days
pheasant
hunt
o
i
dont
see
how
you
can
call
this
an
old
ale
its
an
old
style
im
sure
straddles
a
few
styles
excellent
and
more
or
less
unique
for
what
it
is
pours
a
deep
brown
that
has
a
ruby
tint
that
comes
out
with
a
light
behind
it
with
little
foam
or
carbonation
smells
of
an
alcohol
burn
with
deep
rich
fruit
notes
like
figs
and
currants
rating
to
style
i
can
really
see
why
people
would
love
this
beer
the
flavors
are
strong
and
bold
and
close
out
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
bitter
on
the
back
end
which
all
fades
away
into
a
smooth
blend
for
me
personally
these
arent
flavors
i
enjoy
so
liquefying
and
fermenting
them
isnt
going
to
change
that
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
muddy
black
pourslight
white
head
the
aroma
has
smoke
leather
and
booze
with
caramel
and
tobacco
undertones
taste
as
wonderful
as
it
smells
a
great
beer
it
is
a
well
carbonated
sipper
i
am
definitely
going
to
have
to
revisit
this
one
really
impressed
with
my
first
hotd
brew
adam
is
easily
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
will
be
seeking
out
more
beers
by
this
brewery
had
a
bottle
of
batch
86
wasnt
as
great
rating
adjusted
overall
pretty
good
stuff
but
lacks
the
wow
factor
for
me
id
have
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
heady
beast
tan
big
bubbled
and
stubborn
ugly
dirty
brown
with
sediment
floating
aromas
of
sweet
fruitfig
strongest
malt
is
dominant
some
yeast
notes
here
too
taste
is
big
and
rich
lots
of
malt
with
sweet
toasted
grain
taste
notes
of
toffee
figs
finish
is
warm
but
not
strongly
alcoholic
ends
clean
and
rather
quick
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
velvety
smooth
this
is
what
id
like
an
old
ale
to
be
a
malt
bomb
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
better
to
contemplate
delicious
o
this
is
a
sipping
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
but
ill
share
the
bottle
next
time
it
can
get
a
bit
overwhelming
with
the
booze
huge
beer
but
overall
very
great

dark

plenty

taste
is
hot
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
roasty
and
sweet
raisins
and
dark
sour
cherry
this
tastes
like
something
in
ris
territory
more
than
old
ale
a
unique
beer
that
seems
to
bring
together
all
of
the
best
qualities
of
an
old
ale
and
a
quad
id
buy
this
frequently
if
it
was
available
where
i
lived
its
truly
epic
unmatched
complexity
not
for
newbies
i
have
one
other
bottle
and
im
going
to
let
it
go
longer
than
this
one
overall
very
good
quite
unique
batch
70
wow
did
i
hold
on
to
this
one
for
a
bit
but
well
worth
i
sweet
black

dark
and
sweet
to
look
at
not

cloying

come
check
me
out

smooth
and
nice
seems
to
be

overall
wish
i
had
more
everyone
who
share
it
at
beachwood
1
loved
it
including
me
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
creamy
head
light
carbonation
but
a
huge
chocolate
aroma
quite
nice
very
sweet
and
deep
flavor
that
coats
your
mouth
and
remains
long
after
your
sip
big
big
flavor
but
still
quite
smooth
this
is
a
great
beer
in
this
variety
o
this
was
a
good
beer
in
a
style
i
typically
steer
clear
of
i
really
dont
understand
why
its
so
highly
ranked
but
i
also
dont
appreciate
the
style
3
5
o
this
is
fantastic
i
cant
believe
how
much
flavor
this
12oz
bottle
packed
it
was
truly
one
of
the
most
complex
brews
ive
had
it
was
a
little
bit
of
a
mix
between
a
barleywine
and
a
belgian
quad
would
love
to
try
the
from
the
wood
version
at
some
point
verdict
a
really
lovely
old
ale
from
hair
of
the
dog
the
complexity
and
balance
is
wonderful
and
makes
for
a
really
lovely
session
its
no
wonder
why
this
brewery
has
become
one
of
the
premier
in
the
country
certainly
a
sipper
not
only
due
to
high
abv
but
more
importantly
time
brings
out
new
complexity
in
the
beer
overall
an
outstanding
old
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
cheers
to
adam
and
my
awesome
brother
one
of
my
favorite
beers
just
finally
took
the
time
to
review
it
wonderful
for
anyone
who
likes
a
rich
complex
beerold
alequad
a
great
beer
fresh
or
with
plenty
of
age
along
with
its
variants
overall
old
ales
are
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
i
love
flavorful
beers
this
one
does
not
disappoint
i
wish
i
could
get
this
one
regularly

good

alcohol
is
insanely
well

with
almost
zero

noticed
after

overall
this
is
a
world
class
old
ale
huge
complexity
and
balance
of
malty
flavors
and
dangerously
smooth
to
sip
on
this
blew
me
away
wow
overall
this
rich
exceptionally
complex
beer
lived
up
to
the
expectations
that
became
greater
every
year
i
didnt
drink
it
and
i
was
supremely
content
to
take
a
long
time
savoring
and
contemplating
its
nuances
the
smell
of
was
so
outstanding
i
could
inhale
the
aroma
all
day
however
the
amazing
aroma
gave
me
high
expectations
that
the
flavor
simply
did
not
deliver
on
i
was
expecting
a
complex
range
of
flavor
while
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
a
simplistic
flavor
o
overall
an
excellent
old
ale
a
bit
heavy
on
the
leather
but
if
you
can
get
by
that
it
makes
for
an
excellent
beer
o
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
beer
on
this
planet
i
just
love
this
beer
so
freaking
much
incredible
complex
flavors
and
aromas
drinks
somewhere
between
a
barleywine
and
an
imperial
stout
love
it
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
dangerously
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
very
enjoyable
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
is
no
doubt
a
great
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
they
could
just
use
a
little
better
qc
on
their
bottle
conditioning
o
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
that
is
quite
filling
and
one
that
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
due
to
the
complexity
additionally
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
not
quite
as
well
hidden
as
i
would
have
enjoyed
and
that
makes
it
one
that
you
can
only
have
a
single
beer
during
a
session
this
one
will
really
warm
you
from
the
inside
so
im
glad
i
chose
to
have
it
on
this
below
freezing
winter
evening
overall
nice
flavors
but
this
is
just
too
boozy
for
me
o
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
and
with
some
age
on
it
it
could
turn
it
from
excellent
to
worldclass
its
a
little
boozy
but
overall
its
pretty
fantastic
o
certainly
deserving
of
its
high
ranks
this
is
an
incredibly
delicious
brew
stashed
a
few
in
the
cellar
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
time
does
to
this
one
very
very
well
done
hair
of
the
dog
mediumfull
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
alive
but
also
smooth
and
creamy
totally
complex
beer
with
myriad
layers
quite
a
standout
in
a
long
weekend
in
which
a
lot
of
rare
beers
were
ticked
o
a
solid
old
ale
that
goes
great
with
the
weather
cooling
off
a
wonderful
beer
o
adam
is
a
superb
masterpiece
of
a
big
beer
it
provides
such
a
wellcrafted
mix
of
malty
flavors
accented
with
hoppy
character
definitely
find
this
beer
and
i
imagine
adam
from
the
wood
is
probably
amazing
as
well
probably
the
highlight
beer
of
my
trip
to
san
diego
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
would
definitely
do
again
if
available
o
this
needs
a
lot
of
calming
down
wish
i
had
another
to
commit
to
the
cellar
thanks
to
satlymalty
for
the
chance
to
try
it
o
while
old
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
and
i
couldnt
see
drinking
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
i
cant
deny
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
nice
big
beer
thats
smooth
and
has
a
bunch
going
on
all
in
a
nice
balance
exemplary
for
an
old
ale
m
full
but
not
overly
syrupy
very
creamy
fantastic
beer
to
drink
pours
as
brown
as
possible
before
you
get
to
black
with
a
thick
tan
creamy
head
smells
of
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
toasted
malt
and
the
flavors
definitely
match
up
love
the
sweetness
but
its
balanced
with
some
smokiness
and
bitterness
and
a
trace
of
alcohol
very
rich
and
fullbodied
mouthfeel
this
is
an
awesome
complex
beer
that
could
take
the
place
of
dessert
after
a
good
meal
pretty
good
old
ale
not
my
favorite
but
still
good
i
enjoy
a
bit
more
sweetness
in
the
flavor
but
there
are
still
some
nice
interesting
smoked
and
raosty
notes
some
slight
coffee
and
coca
can
be
perceived
too

overall
a
great
beer
not
one
that
i
would
be
drinking
everyday
but
something
that
i
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
again
in
the
future

very

intriguing
could
smell
it
all
day
taste
follows
with
all
things
mentioned
above
again
very
complex
in
fact
im
going
to
say
this
is
the
most
complex
beer
ive
had
to
date
id
give
it
a
5
but
its
hard
not
to
imagine
it
couldnt
be
improved
upon
with
so
much
going
on
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
smooth
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
without
too
much
sweetness
or
bitterness
overall
a
very
fine
beer
going
to
have
to
pick
one
of
these
up
now
and
again
i
think
o
a
great
offering
from
hotd
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
but
greatly
preferred
it
from
the
bottle
i
would
love
to
taste
it
with
some
age
on
it
o
a
bit
too
dry
and
leathery
for
me
but
still
good
a
unique
old
ale
o
not
a
bad
old
ale
most
are
very
fruity
and
this
one
is
not
quite
smokey
with
lots
of
tobacco
too
great
if
you
like
that
in
a
beer
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
can
appreciate
the
complexity
and
balance
but
the
choice
of
flavors
didnt
agree
with
me
that
much
its
a
big
delicious
desert
thank
you
adam
overallthebeerbug
comes
through
again
and
gives
me
this
insane
stout
i
have
to
say
i
was
off
the
stout
kick
until
i
became
friends
with
him
great
brew
cost
5
99
for
a
12
oz
bottle
o
very
fortunate
to
try
this
beer
that
old
and
was
pretty
delicious
considering
how
old
it
was
good
lookin
out
whoever
brought
to
woodshop
tasting
o
love
love
love
this
beer
simply
world
claas
pours
a
deep
brown
with
slight
hues
of
red
with
a
huge
billowing
head
nose
is
dark
fruits
and
leather
taste
opens
up
with
sweet
sugary
malts
up
front
that
slide
to
some
dark
fruits
fig
and
raisin
a
bit
of
ashy
burnt
flavors
are
subtly
in
the
background
and
then
a
dry
woodsy
bitterness
rounds
it
off
mouth
is
creamy
and
full
overall
this
is
a
solid
old
ale
chocked
full
of
flavor
and
really
nice
complexity
wish
i
could
have
grabbed
a
couple
more
of
these
o
all
too
often
beers
smell
complex
and
leave
me
asking
for
more
in
the
taste
not
this
time
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
ive
had
in
which
the
flavor
offers
even
more
complexity
than
the
aroma
this
was
delicious
and
insanely
drinkable
for
a
beer
or
its
style
great
great
offering
from
hotd
im
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
james
overall
excellent
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
nothing
special
but
the
smell
and
taste
more
than
compensate
this
is
an
especially
expressive
dark
brew
and
must
be
tried
very
thankful
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
thanks
matt
overall
this
beer
is
world
class
i
have
to
pick
up
more
and
see
how
it
ages
yum
like
brian
said
best
nonba
old
ale
there
is
highly
recommended
o
best
old
ale
ive
had
no
complaints
at
all
with
this
one
overall
a
great
readily
available
old
ale
that
has
always
been
enjoyable
whenever
ive
decided
to
open
it
however
in
the
side
by
side
i
think
that
adam
from
the
wood
is
the
superior
beer
albeit
by
a
slim
margin
o
a
really
nice
sipping
beer
flavors
are
complex
the
fig
and
leather
flavors
are
done
very
well
overall
i
tend
to
be
more
of
a
fred
person
but
i
cant
deny
the
impressive
display
of
brewing
that
is
adam
overall
this
beer
is
wonderful
lots
of
complexity
going
on
this
beer
pours
black
with
rust
showing
under
light
theres
a
thin
haed
and
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
chocolate
with
molasses
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
dark
roasted
malt
bakers
chocolate
anise
and
a
hint
of
smoke
its
mouthfeel
is
thick
like
cough
syrup
it
has
afleeting
warmth
as
it
goes
down
hair
of
the
dog
adam
is
a
good
beer
mild
for
its
strength
recommended
overall
a
good
sipping
beer
not
available
around
here
but
would
try
again
if
it
crossed
my
path
pours
nearly
black
with
maybe
a
red
tint
at
the
edges
half
finger
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
aroma
sweet
flavor
of
sweet
roasted
malt
followed
by
dark
fruit
malt
and
an
alcohol
sting
medium
body
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
interesting
and
complex
worth
aging
o
this
is
an
a
beer
for
sure
for
me
really
edging
on
a
really
like
this
one
surprised
i
hadnt
had
it
before
very
barleywine
like
really
quite
nice
and
easily
the
best
of
the
three
batches
i
sampled
this
was
killer
stuff
one
of
the
best
brews
on
my
trip
to
portland
and
i
was
damn
glad
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
try
it
this
is
an
extraordinarily
delicious
beer
im
pretty
sure
this
batch
is
pretty
green
yet
and
likely
to
improve
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
o
awesomely
unique
delicious
expensive
but
a
great
treat
ps
the
bartender
that
served
us
at
the
taproom
was
really
rude
we
were
trying
to
have
a
couple
of
beers
on
a
sunny
friday
afternoon
and
she
kept
snapping
at
us
and
grunted
oneword
answers
at
my
questions
overall
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
very
complex
flavors
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
this
is
amazing
ive
heard
some
poor
experiences
with
some
oxidized
old
bottles
of
adam
but
i
think
i
was
lucky
here
everything
came
together
so
well
very
complex
but
there
are
signs
that
would
indicate
the
flavors
may
be
falling
off
it
may
actually
have
peaked
a
year
or
so
ago
i
dont
think
this
beer
can
benefit
at
all
from
additional
aging
drink
now
if
you
have
it
o
not
the
greatest
drinkability
abv
is
somewhat
apparent
but
it
is
a
damn
good
beer
very
tasty
indeed
and
cant
wait
to
see
what
age
will
do
to
this
overall
this
beer
is
astonishing
i
just
reviewed
a
beer
last
week
straight
to
ale
unobtanium
that
i
said
was
the
best
old
ale
id
ever
had
hair
of
the
dog
adam
is
better
at
least
as
good
at
the
very
least
or
this
aged
bottle
is
anyway
i
am
blown
away
by
this
old
ale
i
wish
i
had
more
iso
adam
from
the
wood
iso
more
straightup
adam
amazing
wellaged
bottle
picked
up
at
the
bruery
provisions
in
old
town
orange
dark
murky
brown
with
a
sizeable
head
of
bigbubbled
froth
huge
flavors
of
caramelized
sugar
with
toffee
coffee
cake
treacle
standing
out
warming
brings
out
smooth
alcoholic
esters
bread
crust
earth
husky
grain
complex
deep
but
smooth
a
beer
for
special
occasions
but
i
think
i
could
drink
it
everyday
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
it
was
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
overall
for
an
old
ale
this
beer
is
good
hadnt
seen
it
before
till
i
went
to
brooklyn
a
few
months
back
for
the
b4b
happy
to
have
stumbled
across
it
at
bierkraft
o
a
phenomenal
beer
highly
recommended
will
drink
again
cheers
o
now
i
know
to
age
my
bottles
of
adam
for
quite
some
time
before
digging
into
them
ive
had
several
from
the
late
90s
that
were
mindblowing
but
fresh
this
isnt
my
cup
o
tea
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
german
malt
beverage
that
i
accidentally
stumbled
upon
years
ago
i
love
its
complexity
while
it
is
still
very
bold
and
makes
a
statement
that
it
these
types
of
beers
can
stand
on
their
own
this
could
have
easily
gotten
too
heavyhanded
and
too
thick
and
rich
but
they
put
it
on
the
verge
of
the
craziness
and
slamdunked
a
really
progressive
tasteforward
beer
that
i
will
gladly
consume
any
time
i
get
the
chance
dintriguing
beer
very
tasty
and
thick
that
brings
nice
fruit
flavors
with
a
full
body
i
enjoyed
this
beer
thoroughly
but
ill
leave
it
up
to
time
for
my
remaining
bottles
recommended
for
lovers
of
old
ales
wee
heavies
imperial
porters
and
english
barleywines

o
this
is
beer
went
above
and
beyond
my
expectations
definitely
will
seek
more
of
this
out
in
the
future
overall
favorite
old
ale
the
hops
in
the
finish
is
a
good
counter
for
the
great
amount
of
sweetness
throughout
the
beer
definitely
not
too
sweet
aromas
and
tastes
are
spectacular
overall
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
ever
had
fantastic
o
this
is
a
beauty
of
a
beer
big
complex
taste
and
silky
smooth
easy
drinker
despite
alcohol
must
have
more
o
woodsies
grreattttneeeessss
love
this
thinggo
buy
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
worthy
of
the
praise
indeed
mouthfeel
is
really
good
full
bodied
full
flavor
surprisingly
smooth
and
a
good
carbonation
level
beer
has
a
great
balance
and
really
tasty
adam
is
an
extremely
drinkable
but
its
a
sipper
not
a
chugger
its
ok
though
you
really
wanna
savor
the
flavor
on
this
one
thanks
googzoid10
for
an
awesome
extra
o
interesting
and
complex
but
not
something
id
buy
again
overall
this
beer
is
both
incredible
and
unique
its
like
a
smoked
baltic
porter
mixed
with
an
old
ale
unreal
complexity
yet
highly
drinkable
send
me
this
stuff
batch
81
what
can
i
say
all
my
favorite
components
beautifully
balanced
in
a
creamy
voluptuous
body
leather
wood
smoke
figs
tobacco
and
chocolate
reasonably
dry
and
constantly
compelling
drawing
you
in
for
another
luxurious
sip
simply
amazing
and
even
more
incredible
than
the
bottled
version
i
haves
some
at
home
and
will
age
a
few
and
go
back
to
it
and
see
how
the
bottle
develops
i
will
review
again
o
a
very
tasty
brew
brown
sugary
and
oldalerich
to
the
core
to
be
honest
i
expected
a
bit
more
craziness
from
the
guys
who
made
fred
but
this
is
a
great
woody
old
ale
with
this
base
beer
im
guessing
id
love
adam
from
the
wood
new
beer
questgo
o
a
wonderful
beer
falls
in
the
dangerously
drinkable
category
not
because
you
dont
notice
the
alcohol
taking
effect
but
because
its
so
damn
good
that
you
sip
it
faster
than
you
probably
should
worth
seeking
out
omy
first
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
and
i
am
extremely
impressed
wonderful
balance
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
definetly
an
easy
drinker
doa
drinkability
highly
drinkable
i
also
tried
batch
82
fresh
it
was
good
but
not
quite
as
good
i
think
this
should
be
aged
if
possible
o
a
pleasant
ale
to
drink
a
real
sipper
iso
adam
from
the
wood
o
this
is
an
awesome
batch
really
the
only
reason
i
dont
put
this
as
5s
across
the
board
is
because
i
dont
want
to
be
too
huge
of
a
fan
boy
but
this
is
imo
a
standard
by
which
other
beers
are
judged
overall
a
great
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
o
4
5
o
one
of
the
better
old
ales
ive
had
and
one
of
the
brews
i
was
looking
out
for
at
gravity
head
2012
overall
this
is
a
massively
complex
and
rich
beer
i
loved
it
the
booze
is
incredibly
well
concealed
only
coming
in
ever
so
slightly
in
the
aftertaste
moderate
carbonation
and
clean
slightly
slick
but
dry
finish
cant
wait
to
drink
another
one
in
my
top
5
wow
cheers
full
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
this
beer
is
practically
the
definition
of
silky
smooth
while
the
body
is
a
little
sticky
and
coating
it
slides
gracefully
over
the
tongue
like
melted
butter
the
carbonation
is
obviously
very
lacking
but
doesnt
seem
necessary
overall
a
very
unique
and
fun
beer
the
smokiness
underpins
the
entire
beer
but
never
overwhelms
delicious
need
to
age
some
to
compare
it
to
m
viscous
and
lightly
boozy
o
great
beer
not
sure
if
i
have
had
an
old
ale
before
but
this
one
is
great
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
when
i
was
in
philly
since
i
have
not
seen
it
in
md
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
it
near
you
o
second
chance
at
adam
and
its
even
better
than
i
remembered
it
o
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
at
the
brewery
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
and
snag
one
whenever
i
see
it
i
have
never
been
patient
enough
to
age
this
one
one
of
few
beers
that
truly
is
a
journey
once
you
crack
the
cap
o
my
favorite
year
round
offering
from
hair
of
the
dog
i
always
buy
a
few
bottles
when
i
see
it
in
nyc
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
ages
such
an
underrated
brew
edit
did
try
it
again
and
its
spectacular
overall
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
taste
is
fantastic
unfortunately
my
bottle
seemed
to
be
a
little
flat
so
i
dont
think
this
was
a
fair
representation
of
the
beer
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
another
bottle
o
a
great
beer
from
a
brewery
i
have
only
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
few
beers
from
o
before
this
beer
i
wasnt
sure
i
liked
old
ales
very
much
this
beer
made
me
a
believer
nothing
short
of
pure
deliciousness
o
this
is
a
great
old
ale
i
would
definitely
recommend
that
everyone
who
has
the
opportunity
give
this
a
try
great
beer
dark
rust
great
head
retension
lace
smells
and
taste
caramel
molasses
figs
leather
outstanding
smooth
strong
satisfying
and
very
drinkable
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
at
all
really
compares
well
to
bruery
cuir
at
less
than
12
the
price
would
certainly
have
again
and
cant
wait
to
try
fred
i
wont
pretend
to
be
an
old
ale
expert
but
this
is
a
great
example
based
on
what
ive
had
before
flavors
are
strong
but
very
well
balanced
with
the
boozy
finish
certainly
not
something
that
youll
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
b
2
5
d
i
think
this
could
be
a
damn
good
beer
if
it
was
allowed
to
be
as
it
stands
its
at
the
lower
end
of
average
with
carbonation
i
could
see
this
easily
breaking
the
4s
but
i
wont
know
tonight
ive
been
having
nothing
been
trouble
with
bwines
from
the
cellar
and
their
carbonation
lately
its
starting
to
grow
tiresome
medium
body
with
light
soft
carbonation
there
barely
registers
on
the
tongue
a
bit
thinner
than
i
thought
the
beer
was
going
to
be
there
is
a
bit
of
boozy
warmth
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
in
the
throat
but
it
doesnt
distract
from
the
beer
overall
really
good
o
an
excellent
old
ale
i
wish
this
was
available
locally
smells
like
the
backroom
of
a
mobsters
den
woodsmoke
vanilla
dried
fruit
leather
intense
but
not
as
rich
as
a
real
dark
porter
or
stout
kind
of
indefinable
not
like
any
beer
ive
ever
had
and
consistently
surprising
every
time
i
have
it
supercarbonated
which
i
think
is
kind
of
distracting
and
while
it
has
a
huge
head
it
dissipates
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
overall
though
a
thoroughly
excellent
beer
and
a
good
way
to
unwind
at
the
end
of
the
night
if
you
dont
feel
like
drinking
too
much
and
only
want
one
beer
to
mull
over
edit
revisited
many
time
since
this
first
review
including
a
fresh
growler
shipped
in
a
trade
carbonation
hasnt
been
an
issue
since
that
very
first
and
unfortunate
bottle
its
complex
unique
and
consistent
and
i
will
seek
it
out
permanently
as
a
cellar
staple
forevermore
wow
after
being
underwhelmed
by
doggie
claws
my
first
hotd
brew
ive
been
won
over
i
loved
this
beer
from
overpoured
start
to
drawnout
finish
mmmm
d
a
pretty
decent
beer
with
some
flaws
the
bitterness
in
flavor
and
odd
bubblegum
smell
are
hard
to
look
past
but
i
continued
to
drink
in
spite
of
them
3
5
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
translucent
but
barely
seethrough
unless
held
up
to
the
light
topping
it
off
is
a
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
stubbornly
until
the
last
drop
and
leaves
an
equally
creamy
layer
of
lacing
on
the
glass
some
trub
present
so
be
careful
with
the
pour
though
even
with
some
in
there
it
is
nonoffensive
aroma
is
thick
with
heavy
malts
creamy
caramel
and
chocolate
chips
notes
of
dark
fruit
uncommonly
smooth
on
the
tongue
tastes
of

with
notes

creamy

splendidly
drinkable

at

pours
with
very
minimal
head
that

some
spotty
bubbles
on
the
surface
an

around
the
outside
of

the
color
is
deep
mahogany
glints
of
light
come
through
but
not
much
this
beer
is
pretty
dark
the
aroma
is
pretty
fruity
with
some
figs
roast
and
a
bit
of
leather
flavor
is
fairly
similar
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
a
light
smokeyness
that
accompanies
the
figs
and
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
with
a
good
lowish
level
of
carbonation
could
use
a
touch
more
body
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
very
smooth
and
nicely
mellow
unfortunately
i
have
not
had
this
beer
fresh
but
this
seems
to
have
come
along
nicely
overall
this
is
a
decently
good
offering
from
the
northwest
i
could
bug
my
sister
for
this
one
but
thanks
to
matttyce
for
this
offering
i
dont
have
to
overall
why
have
i
not
drank
any
hair
of
the
dog
beers
yet
i
am
honestly
just
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
can
easily
say
this
is
the
best
old
ale
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
should
age
really
well
and
its
great
fresh
dont
pass
this
beer
up
overall
this
is
a
decently
good
offering
from
the
northwest
thats
not
hard
to
get
but
obviously
not
localhave
to
bug
the
relatives
to
gethave
to
trade
for
this
is
the
first
old
ale
ive
had
i
enjoyed
it
i
have
two
other
bottles
of
batch
81
that
will
be
cellared
away
for
awhile
im
interested
to
see
what
some
time
does
to
this
one
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
stronger
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
while
remarkable
beer
of
a
forgotten
style
unfortunately
distribution
is
sparse
i
regret
not
trying
adam
from
the
wood
while
there
but
time
didnt
allow
o
the
flavor
changed
from
molasses
dried
fruits
to
a
coffee
bitter
sweet
chocolate
taste
over
a
period
of
5
minutes
this
is
a
very
strong
and
complex
beer
i
was
attracted
the
the
name
of
this
beer
after
a
night
of
several
plinys
and
the
movie
the
shining
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
this
beer
is
wonderfully
complex
and
beautifully
balanced
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
given
the
alcohol
content
its
amazingly
drinkable
as
i
said
the
flavour
profile
changes
throughout
the
beer
and
gets
better
and
better
with
every
sip
absolutely
great
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
the
name
thank
you
hair
of
the
dog
well
done
definitely
a
classic
for
the
style
and
in
general
probably
preaching
to
the
choir
but
this
beer
rocks
o
a
very
nice
treat
not
for
everyday
consumption
but
the
more
i
sip
it
the
more
i
like
it
oglad
this
came
around
i
have
been
intimidated
by
the
price
tag
but
might
pick
some
up
for
a
special
occasion
look
out
other
oregon
breweries
here
i
come
must
try
d
this
is
an
extremely
easy
drinking
beer
which
is
exceptional
considering
the
alcohol
content
on
this
one
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
allowing
the
complexities
to
come
to
the
forefront
becomes
better
and
better
with
each
sip
as
it
warms
and
disappears
from
my
glass
quicker
than
i
would
have
liked
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
cherry
adam
but
i
think
i
like
the
balance
and
profile
of
the
base
beer
better
a
little
better
really
top
notch
at
10
impossibly
easy
to
drink
hotd
absolutely
kills
it
again
i
love
this
beer
thanks
to
mthomas84
for
this
one
it
reminds
me
of
cbs
but
with
a
less
overwhelming
sugarybourbon
taste
first
few
sips
are
good
but
as
it
warmed
and
got
deeper
it
became
overpoweringly
cloying
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
have
4
oz
of
but
12
was
a
bit
much
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
and
even
thought
its
the
first
its
one
of
alans
best
54
54

5
overall
old
ales
are
definitely
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
i
was
slightly
disappointed
by
this
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
of
this
beer
but
this
fresh
version
was
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
hoping
the
older
bottles
i
have
are
more
mellow
in
the
smoke
acrid
roast
and
more
fruity
well
find
out
down
the
road
i
guess
big
thanks
to
jerz
for
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
havent
had
a
lot
of
old
ales
i
tend
to
avoid
them
but
this
one
changed
my
mind
the
flavor
combinations
are
great
and
i
love
the
raisinfig
aftertaste
a
big
beer
for
sure
but
a
nice
treat
overall
a
worldclass
brew
overall
a
solid
brew
but
for
some
reason
it
didnt
completely
grab
me
i
liked
it
but
not
an
a
beer
for
me

was

stout

i
had

talk
ive
hear
surrounding
adam
and
a

ring
of

is
left
marking
the
apex
of
the
head
and
i
dug
it
my

is
that
this
one
is
maybe
3

made

not

this
is
some
odd
stuff
to
quaff
the
alcohol
doesnt
even
make
an

itself
maybe
thats
a
good

my
final

are
that
this

not
quite
melt

i
still
find

i
saw

shoot
out
from
under

lid
right
as
i
cracked
it
after
removing
the
cap
it
proceeded
to
foam
up
almost
spilling
over
but
i
poured
just
in
time
its
a
murky
maybe
too
murky
dark
dark
red
with
some
sediment
and
1
inch
of
beige
head
that
retains
14
throughout
which
is
surprising
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetnessfruitiness
and
tobacco
its
thick
and
extremely
smooth
on
the
palate
with
flavors
of
citric
hops
chocolate
tobacco
juice
fruitiness
and
a
bitterness
that
is
definitely
there
but
subdued
by
the
massive
amount
of
malts
its
so
smooth
i
can
barely
feel
the
last
sip
in
my
mouth
like
silk
i
shared
this
12
oz
but
i
could
easily
drink
2
of
them
by
myself
an
old
ale
i
dont
think
so
their
website
calls
it
an
historic
german
style
that
is
no
longer

some

not

in

its

drink
and
i
think
it

scores

this
is
similar
to
batch
5000
but
not
in
the
same
league
drink
this
close
to
room
temperature
my
ratings
would
be
much
lower
at
colder
temperatures
drinkability
is
just
plain
super
here
tasty
and
thick
without
being
abusive
of
the
tongue
or
unbalanced
this
was
worth
every
bit
of
the
4
i
paid
for
the
bottle
and
i
absolutely
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
brew
dark
brown
with
ruby
and
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
a
light
poured
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
ring
as
you
drink
chocolate
toffee
prunes
and
raisins
some
roast
maybe
some
hops
but
this
babys
about
the
malt
chocolate
is
the
overriding
flavor
here
sharp
bitterness
and
alcohol
burn
very
mouth
filling
definatley
a
night
cap
taste
is
again
of
dark
malts
with
a
big
hop
backbone
the
malts
lent
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
to
the
beer
there
was
also
a
light
smokiness
and
some
slight
fruit
notes
present
finishes
with
a
coffee
hint
and
a
considerable
hop
bitterness
drinkability
not
for
the
meek
one
is
probably
plenty
12
ounce

more

a
heck
of

10
abv
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
definitely
enjoyable
but
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
flavor
is
malty
with
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
mixing
with
caramel
no
hops
here
there
is
hot
alcohol
present
from
middle
through
finish
that
keeps
this
beer
in
the
sipping
category
a
roasty
malt
and
chocolate
presence
is
also
lingering
with
each
sip
quite
a
nice
robust
beer
that
is
not
for
the
meek
beer
drinker
very
dark
body
similar
to
a
porter
or
a
stout
with
only
a
little
light
shining

bottom
of

is

alcohol

profile
taste
is

large
acidic
and
earthy
very
malty
and
strong
slight
coffee
and
cocoa
tones
are
also
present
this
is
a
great
beer
from
an
underrepresented
style
i
could
definitely
session
this
one
the
noticeable
alcohol
and
complex
flavor
keep
this
beer
only
moderately
drinkable
but
i
find
it
fascinating
an
excellent
counterpoint
to
a
barleywine
or
double
ipa
this
beer
has
a
very
unique
character
overall
a
ridiculously
drinkable
and
smooth
enormous
beer
its
beautiful
from
the
first
pour
and
its
flavor
is
extremely
complex
and
can
stand
up
to
quite
a
bit
of

i
cant
say
that
i
would
be
able
to
have
more
than
2
of
these
as
much
as
i
like
it
even
still
a
delicious
beer
that
would
be
even
better
in
the
fall
or
winter
i
recommend
you
pick
one
up
and
give
it
a
try
you
wont
be
dissapointed
d
this
is
a
very
impressive
big
beer
that
has
lots
of
complexity
but
blends
it
all
together
great
beer
that
will
really
improve
with
age
or
wood
i
imagine
pours
a
murkey
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
a
small
ring
over
top
the
nose
is
intense
with
lots
of
big
fig
aroma
soy
sauce
molasses
i
like
it
very
intense
the
flavor
is
a
bit
different
i
get
some
smokeyness
over
some
soy
sauce
and
slightly
woodytanniny
flavors
damn
this
beer
is
good
i
can
see
why
the
adam
from
the
wood
is
sooo
damn
good
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
small
to
minimal
carbonation
right
where
i
expected
it
to
be
drinkability
is
top
of
its
class
10
where
is
it
not
in
the
nose
not
in
the
flavor
damn
good
beer
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
one
on
the
tongue
a
huge
and
complex
flavor
profile
runs
wild
very
old
world
indeed
heavy
bodied
sweet
fruit
and
a
wealth
of
complex
malt
this
plays
with
a
hoppy
background
that
works
very
well
with
the
overall
balance
there
is
a
big
smokey
side
to
it
as
well
as
the
more
familiar
old
ale
characteristics
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
alcohol
starts
warming
the
palate
and
doesnt
stop
for
a
good
length
of
time
there
is
alot
of
personality
in
this
ale
many
elements
to
sit
and
appreciate
for
a
good
spell
opaque
dark
chocolate
in
color
topped
by
a
mediumthick
light
brown
head
way
darker
than
i
expected
but
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
smell
out
of
the
gate
was
flatout
amazing
brown
sugar
to
start
lots
of
caramel
baking
spices
toasted
malt
as
it
warmed
faint
aromas
of
maraschino
cherries
developed
bigtime
toffee
maple
syrup
cafe
mocha
goddamn
i
said
goddamn
taste
captured
just
about
everything
in
the
aroma
at
some
point
or
another
tons
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
backed
by
a
zing
of
spicy
hops
that
rounded
out
into
a
mouthdrying
extremely
smooth
bittering
major
candiedflavors
some
light
coffee
something
grassy
and
just
before
i
finished
i
swear
i
tasted
a
bit
of
smoke
mouth
was
big
thick
and
full
with
a
near
perfect
blanket
of
bubbles
across
the
tongue
the
abv
warms
the
tongue
and
stomach
almost
immediately
this
stuff
is
just
amazing
another
killer
from
hotd
smooth
taste
at
first
followed
by
a
spritzy
carbonation
that
opens
your
mouth
up
and
a
mouthcoating
mellow
sweetness
in
the
finish
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
at
all
nicely
balanced
over
all
although
the
co2
is
much
a
sometimes
balances
out
what
could
be
too
sweet
though
very
good
this
is
a
unique
one
appears
a
dark
russet
cabinet
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
light
brings
out
some
red
coloration
in
the
beer
smell
and
taste
are
very
complex
lots
of
must
and
alcohol
as
well
as
a
ton
of
fruity
smells
such
as
figs
raisins
dried
fruits
etc
you
could
find
anything
you
want
in
there
probably
a
little
wine
like
perhaps
and
im
picking
up
on
some
spices
that
vaguely
remind
me
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
also
has
a
pretty
present
alcohol
character
which
burns
a
bit
on
the
way
down
pretty
intense
slick
mouthfeel
but
this
one
isnt
meant
to
be
drank
in
mass
quantities
one
was
enough
comments
watch
out
this
is
really
good
stuff
with
some
serious
oomph
to
it
thick
plumy
cumulus
cloud
of
head
cocacola
hue
with
a
thick
maple
syrup
look
to
it
some
active
carbonation
around
the
sides
malt
up
fron
for
bouquet
with
lemon
and
lime
notes
and
some
moss
in
there
as
well
pine
flavors
jam
of
malt
ginger
sweet
raspberry
and
roasted
characters
make
for
an
interesting
rendition
despite
the
alcohol
there
is
quite
a
light
feel
to
the
whole
production
one
will
do
it
for
me
though
it
is
quite
fine
drinkability
and
overall
an
excellent
old
ale
though
its
still
quite
young
its
tasty
as
all
hell
im
going
to
let
the
other
one
chill
for
a
while
and
im
almost
damn
sure
itll
be
perfect
in
a
few
years
mmmm
i
cant
wait
drinkability
something
about
the
nose
made
this
less
drinkable
than
other
highalcohol
beers
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
will
do
very
well
if
allowed
to
mellow
out
for
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
brick
redbown
clear
tan
head
big
carbonation
sweet
and
sour
aroma
sweet
and
sour
tasting
interesting
beer
pleasant
malty
sweet
flavor
some
chocolate
notes
slightly
bitter
finish
complex
tasting
sweet
and
sour
aroma
not
bad
the
brewer
suggests
adam
as
a
dessert
beer
served
with
chocolate
or
cigars
i
heartily
concur
an
enjoyable
old
ale
with
a
twist
a
big
smoky
flavor
in
this
beer
melds
well
with
the
sweetness
and
very
little
alcohol
makes
this
dangerously
drinkable
quite
good
and
one
id
have
again
light
brown
head
over
a
dark
chestnut
colored
beer
left
some
small
islands
of
lace
rich
aroma
some
caramel
chocolate
and
roasted
notes
dark
malts
and
caramel
up
front
mix
in
with
some
sweet
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
theres
a
light
coco
bitterness
towards
the
end
and
then
a
warm
stomach
theres
plenty
going
on
in
the
big
smooth
beer
batch
no
56
pours
with
an
outrageously
massive
head
a
dense
simmering
mass
of
eggshell
brown
rising
over
the
rim
of
the
goblet
like
a
souffle
gooey
sloppy
lacing
dries
out
into
strata
of
geologic
proportions
average
viscosity
to
this
opaque
gleaming
ebony
liquid
what
a
visual
feast
pungent
licorice
and
beechwood
aromas
along
with
heaps
of
near
rauchbierlike
smokiness
are
wrapped
in
a
marshy
nosefeel
the
flavor
too
begins
with
a
very
strong
burning
wood
smokiness
that
develops
into
something
more
like
heavy
black
pepper
whiffs
of
vanilla
bean
and
juniper
or
thyme
mingle
with
salt
as
the
beer
warms
on
the
palate
by
the
end
of
the
glass
its
like
drinking
liquid
kalamata
olives
with
a
round
herbal
bitterness
and
tenacious
smoky
aftertaste
almost
gamey
saline
mouthfeel
has
a
body
thick
and
syrupy
enough
to
rival
the
most
nefarious
imperial
stouts
a
slow
motion
punch
of
alcoholic
fire
connects
with
the
gut
hard
but
this
is
still
very
drinkable
seriously
tranquilizing
this
must
be
beers
answer
to
opium
or
thai
stick
amazing
overall
its
a
cold
stormy
night
in
long
beach
for
once
and
this
warming
thick
malty
sipper
fits
the
bill
perfectly
very
nice
indeed
along
with
the
doggie
claws
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
hair
of
the
dog
i
bet
this
is
wonderous
when
aged

hops
on

potent

as
expected
is
a
tad
on
the
heavy
side
but
who
would
guzzle
this
brew
drinkability
id
a
tad
tricky
i
gave
it
a
4
0
beacuse
it
foes
down
nicely
fro
a
high
abv
whether
i
could
have
two
in
a
night
well
deep
smooth
chestnut
with
low
dense
tan
head
caramel
scent
thick
caramel
with
smoky
tones
that
take
on
a
touch
of
creosote
toward
the
end
the
smoke
makes
it
intriguing
but
im
not
interested
in
having
another
a
hair
on
the
syrupy
side
subtle
warming
thats
just
what
you
need
on
a
freaking
cold
evening
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
the
carbonation
is
too
intense
to
enjoy
this
right
out
of
the
bottle
and
requires
sitting
at
room
temp
to
mellow
to
the
point
of
being
enjoyable
the
smoke
becomes
burdensome
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
boozy
making
this
one
difficult
to
finish
it
tickles
with
carbonation
and
alcohol
you
can
eat
this
in
wedges
treacle
italian

whole

a

then
hed
turn
around
purring

smiling
and
slash
you
nice
the
liquid
is
a
deep
opaque
brown
color
topped
with
a
nononsense

the
foam
has
considerable
staying
power
and
produces
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
the
centerpiece
of
the
brew
alcohol
mixed
with
fruitblack
cherries
theres
a
sweetlike
malt
smell
thats
almost
syrupy
along
with
smoke

freshcut

smells
i
love
aromas
like
thiscomplex
and
fun
to
sniff
new
aromas
throw
themselves
at
you
every
time
you
take
a
sip
the
taste
is
considerably
sweet
hinged
with
a
powerful
alcohol
warming
theres
a
spiciness
and
continued
fruitiness
in
the
taste
this
is
a
thick
chewy
substantial
beer
and
is
extremely
enjoyable

with

i
was
expecting
the
usual
overthetop
hop
etc
but
got
an
interesting
experience
adam
was
full
of
the
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
plum
dates
and
raisins
the
taste
is
not
far
from
the
aroma
with
malt
sweetness
tones
of
plums
or
prunes
dates
currants
and
alcohol
the
mouth
feel
is
fullbodied
thick
and
comforting
i
will
be
returning
to
this
one
as
often
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
one
but
of
course
i
havent
tried
fred
rose
or
ruth
yet
full
bodied
its
nice
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
the
smoky
note
was
interesting
aroma
is
sweetly
malty
with
spicy
and
yesty
things
happening
as
well
alcohol
presence
is
obvious
taste
is
of
spicy
dark
malts
dark
fruits
and
warming
alcohol
works
its
magic
in
the
mouth
and
throat
mouthfeel
okay
just
a
bit
overboard
on
the
everything
and
drinkability
isnt
the
best
due
to
bigtime
foaming
issues
i
hate
to
wait
and
just
plain
hard
to
get
down
overall
drinkability
and
overall
definitely
suffers
due
to
the
alcohol
taste
i
have
to
admit
this
is
the
first
beer
that
ended
up
down
the
drain
it
got
worse
with
each
subsequent
sip
totally
ruined
my
taste
for
any
beer
the
rest
of
the
day
i
would
avoid
it
not
a
good
beer
enjoyed
this
with
my
favorite
everyday
cigar
a
padron
4000
maduro
and
they
complemented
each
other
very
nicely
wow
i
dont
mind
alcohol
flavor
but
when
it
burns
i
take
it
as
a
sign
that
i
am
drinking
something
that
i
should
not
drink
this
also
gave
me
a
headache
this
beer
is
great
except
for
the
huge
alcohol
flavor
burn
and
headache
tone
that
down
and
you
have
yourself
an
absolute
winner
as
it
is
i
might
try
it
again
some
time
my
advice
is
simple
if
you
see
it
get
it
and
try
it
it
is
well
worth
it
a
remarkable
brew
outstanding
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
ment
to
be
aged
for
special
occasions
although
i
would
find
it
hard
to
keep
it
in
the
cellar
for
long
pours
with
the
vigor
of
an
overcharged
homebrew
or
a
lively
belgian
ale
forms
a
massive
tan
colored
head
an
aromatic
brew
to
say
the
least
dry
rot
chocolate
charred
graham
crackers
and
bits
of
smoke
soft
enough
in
the
nose
to
leave
the
vague
impression
of
fruit
or
at
least
some
sort
of
essence
of
fruit
acidic
in
a
smoky
sense
imagine
gulping
a
mouthful
of
eyeburning
campfire
smoke
while
tending
a
fire
that
sensation
is
buried
in
there
under
the
surprisingly
light
chocolatey
malty
wood
flavors
incredibly
complex
the
levels
and
variations
through
which
this
goes
on
ones
tongue
before
one
finishes
a
single
bottle
is
mindblowing
alcohol
isnt
terribly
noticeable
but
as
tends
to
be
the
case
it
hit
me
hard
nonetheless
12
oz
bottle
from
batch
number
54
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
deep
red
tone
the
head
on
this
is
a
monster
i
poured
it
into
a
23oz
glass
and
by
the
time
i
was
done
the
head
was
almost
overflowing
its
was
a
rocky
frothy
head
that
was
light
tan
in
color
and
had
at
least
a
finger
in
height
worth
of
head
the
entire
session
also
leaving
nice
lacing
as
it
was
consumed
the
aroma
is
extremely
fruity
with
the
smell
of
smoke
and
alcohol
lingering
about
as
well
very
interesting
smell
with
some
hints
of
medicine
as
well
which
actually
blends
into
the
smell
quite
nicely
the
taste
is
big
on
roasted
malts
with
notes
of
smokiness
and
dark
fruits
as
well
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
style
all
its
own
with
properties
from
a
variety
of
standard
styles
incorporated
there
is
a
slight
hop
and
bitter
finish
to
this
one
the
body
on
this
is
medium
to
full
and
it
has
good
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
highly
drinkable
with
not
much
of
the
10
in
sight
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
fantastic
highly
recommended
sweet
fruity
some
smokey
tobaco
leaf
flavours
very
complex
quite
tasty
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
chocolate
i
havent
been
impressed
with
any
of
the
hair
of
dogs
ive
had
recently
but
this
damn
this
is
a
great
beer
its
not
quite
a
belgian
not
quite
a
stout
and
not
quite
a
smoked
beer
it
sort
of
falls
someplace
inbetween
all
perfectly
balanced
and
oh
so
tasty
id
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
this
beer
has
a
jet
black
motor
oil
body
with
a
tan
foam
head
the
scent
is
thick
malt
the
taste
features
alocohol
spice
dark
fruit
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
hop
full
mouth
basically
it
is
an
intense
tasting
brew
a
little
over
the
top
i
think
but
overall
pretty
dang
good
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
but
i
forced
myself
to
sip
and
savor
i
really
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
in
loveland
co
that
was
a
foolish
mistake
highly
recommended
nice

had
party
in
my
mouth
and
everyone
was
invited
medium
to
full
body
starts
out
very
carbonated
and
mellows
out
a
bit
it
is
thick
and
syrupy

robust
explosion
of

producing
caramel
and

in

orgy
of
hops
and
loads
of
malt
yield
this
creation
we
know
as
adam
big
old
ale
the
way
it

be
done
with

thanks
again
to
skyhand
a
yeasty
hoppy
aroma
with
all
kinds
of
hints
of
other
things
a
nice
sweet
malty
blend
of
raisin
banana
lemon
almost
like
a
weiss
thickish
mouthfeel
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
complex
sweetness
lingered
till
the
end
i
seem
to
feel
this
is
a
great
brew
but
the
blend
just
isnt
something
im
into
right
now
i
am
absolutely
enamored
with
this
adam
this
is
like
a
perfect
strong
scotch
ale
with
extraordinary
drinkability
and
taste
i
will
be
seeking
more
of
these
adams
the
sooner
the
better
very
highly
recommended
batch
47
an
interesting
beer
created
from
written
accounts
of
a
beer
once
brewed
in
dortmund
germany
nobody
truly
knows
what
the
original
recipe
was
but
the
brewer
has
created
this
wonderful
dark
brown
interpretation
with
its
soft
tan
head
it
has
a
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
and
a
very
complex
taste
the
oily
body
is
very
malty
and
tastes
of
chocolate
peat
and
sprucepine
can
be
found
before
the
hoppy
finish
leaves
you
in
bewilderment
it
is
as
unusual
as
it
is
addictive
this
beer
rocked
hair
of
the
dog
adam
batch
59
was
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
was
an
attractive
dark
ruddy
brown
with
an
abstract
scattered
stiff
tannish
head
the
perky
nose
contained
roasty
and
rich
sharp
malts
with
strong
notes
of
plump
raisins
and
subtler
banana
smelled
like
tasty
meal
in
a
bottle
my
suspicions
were
proven
correct
on
the
first
taste
which
revealed
a
robust
and
sharp
rich
and
roasty
raisiny
malt
body
with
notes
of
earth
and
banana
a
moderately
bitter
finish
rounded
out
the
deep
and
complex
malt
profile
with
lingering
prunyraisin
oaky
essence
that
satisfied
the
palate
to
the
very
end
the
body
was
full
and
rich
like
the
flavors
alcohol
was
completely
hidden
throughout
while
quite
rich
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
fine
balance
of
it
all
this
is
probably
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
a
must
try
for
enthusiasts
of
richstrong
ales
adam
poured
a
dark
reddishblack
with
a
beautiful
tan
head

is
oaky
musty
earthiness
and
sour

very
unique
and
intrigueing
taste
is
oaky
with
molasses
rich
earthy
malts
some
smokiness
a
winey
fruitness
and
tangy
bitterness
very
complex
finish
is
vinous
tangy
and
warming
chewy
thick
mouthfeel
i
think
im
going
to
get
a
keg
of
this
for
the
big
softball
game
hahaha
batch

pours
a

thick
creamy
offwhite

that
goes
very
slowly
and
leaves
gobs
of
lace

very

slightly

bitter
but
not
bad
alcohol
is
less
noticeable
than
in
the
fred
3
90
for
a
12oz
bottle
overall
a
must
try
i
kept
going
back
and
forth
from
4
0
to
5
0
on
most
of
the
categories
for
review
i
dont
know
if
thats
an
indication
of
my
own
indecision
im
not
so
cocksure
as
others
on
my
first
shot
at
a
new
brew
or
something
to
be
said
about
the
complexity
of
this
beer
its
damn
good
i
know
that
what
a
treat
a
nice
brown
head
that
lasts
and
a
body
dark
enough
that
no
light
shines
through
it
has
a
pleasing
roasted
aroma
and
a
full
substantial
mouthfeel
and
flavor
smooth
not
bitter
its
10
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
at
all
distracting
unusual
that
a
strong
offering
like
this
would
seem
to
be
so
drinkable
some
selfcontrol
may
be
required
for
this
brew
very
nice
beer
kind
of
surprised
by
the
porter
undertones
but
solid
effort
i
didnt
know
they
had
trappist
breweries
in
oregon
batch55
poured
a
huge
head
that
took
forever
to
die
down
i
actually
had
to
scoop
a
bit
out
dark
murky
brown
aroma
is
of
raisins
and
figs
with
aa
overall
earthiness
flavor
is
malty
sweet
like
a
belgian
fruity
with
an
alcohol
kick
has
a
sharp
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
unique
brew
with
alot
of
character
apperance
is
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
reflects
generous
beige
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
like
glue
every
bubble
is
ultrasmall
and
identical
to
its
neighbor
complex
aroma
reminiscent
of
port
wine
grapeslicorice
plums
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
medium
to
full
body
very
complex
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
everything
in
that
beer
it
seems
plenty
of
malty
fruitiness
with
figs
plums
raspberries
without
neglecting
brown
sugar
smokey
chocolate
nuts
spices
i
hate
to
say
it
but
et
cetera
thats
very
big
and
deep
stuff
but
anyone
would
like
it
i
believe
a
lot
of
fresh
hops
character
contributes
to
the
intensity
the
aftertaste
is
great
delicate
hoppy
but
almost
not
bitter
superbly
warming
and
pleasant
out
of
this
world
balance
considering
the
enormous
quantities
of
malt
and
hops
martint
had
warned
me
this
was
religious
stuff
right
on
probably
the
best
beer
to
ever
cross
my
glass
i
bet
this
ages
well
too
at
4
12
this
is
almost
underrated
if
i
have
the
chance
to
taste
something
better
than
this
i
dont
mind
going
to
hell
i
owe
you
one
jazz88
note
i
got
a
six
pack
and
went
back
and
tried
the
others
and
the
amount
of
foam
is
rediculous
all
of
them
exploded
out
of
the
bottle
and
wouldnt
stop
foaming
i
even
changed
refrigerators
in
the
case
that
there
might
have
been
some
vibrations
insane
how
they
do
that
other
than
the
extreme
foaming
and
20
minutes
to
get
it
into
the
glass
its
a
great
tasting
beer
good
brew
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
hair
of
the
dogs
drinkability
i
bet
this
would
be
an
ideal
beer
for
bbqed
ribs
a
special
occasion
beer
but
one
worth
getting
and
savoring
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
no
but
youll
want
a
litter
of
these
puppies
lying
around
the
house
perfect
for
a
late
fallearly
winter
day
thats
overcast
and
has
a
light
breeze
sit
sip
and
think
so
far
the
best
of
the
hair
of
the
dog
beers
ive
had
a
perfect
afterdinner
beer
with
some
strong
cheese
or
a
cigar
batch
54
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
color
with
the
most
head
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
it
took
about
10
minutes
to
pour
despite
the
massive
foam
there
is
only
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
strong
with
cocoa
and
plums
fairly
sweet
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
with
raisins
and
chocolate
up
front
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
and
hops
kick
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
nice
and
thick
the
drinkability
is
fair
for
this
very
unique
brew
batch
54
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brew
with
a
massive
cream
colored
head
which
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
and
stays
well
pour
this
one
very
gently
aroma
of
fig
raisin
and
lots
of
smoked
peat
very
spicy
on
the
tongue
lots
of
carbonation
almost
too
much
which
takes
away
from
the
mouthfeel
dark
fruits
abound
along
with
the
smoked
peat
character
a
tiny
bit
of
bready
malt
is
noticeable
nice
and
robust
reminds
me
in
ways
of
a
good
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
its
best
if
you
let
it
warm
to
around
55f
a
wonderful
and
unique
brew
all
it
needs
is
a
little
less
carbonation
batch
53
it
poured
with
a
black
body
that
had
ruby
notes
when
held
to
the
light
and
a
khaki
head
aroma
was
dark
malt
and
expresso
the
taste
was
malt
prunes
port
wine
leather
caramel
cola
and
an
alcohol
bite
with
a
10
abv
id
be
surprised
if
it
didnt
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
oily
one
with
light
carbonation
the
finish
was
malt
and
cola
with
light
hop
notes
watch
out
this
is
not
a
session
beer
more
like
a
rumsoaked
fruitcake
dessert
in
a
bottle
perfect
as
a
nightcap
notes
on
batch
59
tasted
a
bottle
of
this
batch
the
other
night
not
sour
at
all
the
lactic
aromaflavor
was
nowhere
to
be
found
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
batch
52
was
definitely
contaminated
59
was
all
about
the
chocolatey
sweetness
with
big
notes
of
burnt
caramel
and
peppery
alcohol
also
mocha
and
a
fait
amount
of
smoke
finish
is
sweet
with
a
lot
of
residual
roast
and
smoke
because
of
this
difference
i
have
increased
the
score
from
the
previous
score
of
3
2
this
is
a
gorgeous
looking
beer
as
it
looks
like
something
straight
from
belgium
a
huge
rocky
pillowy
offwhite
head
tops
the
amber
brown
body
head
retention
is
great
nose
has
a
hoppy
twang
and
some
very
strong
smoke
and
alcohol
notes
i
think
it
smells
kind
of
like
roasted
pork
has
many
flavors
to
pick
out
grape
raisin
and
other
dark
fruits
finishes
dry
slightly
hoppy
with
warming
alcohol
an
interesting
brew
indeed
not
a
huge
personal
favorite
but
highly
recommended
deep
black
color
large
head
very
roasted

very
rich
caramelized

very
intense

yet
a

any

there
is
very
slight

taste
sort
of
subdued
wow
very
nice
beer
from
a
very
nontraditional
beer
maker
many
thanks
to
mjr
for
donating
this
one
to
the
cause
the
beer
sits
heavily
in
my
glass
deeply
stained
mahogany
that
reddens
at
the
thin
parts
of
the
glass
great
head
that
seems
to
have
a
neverending
supply
of
carbonation
i
see
it
rising
from
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
dank
and
slight
hints
of
the
countryside
manure
tasting
it
reveals
a
bold
wave
of
malt
flavors
hot
alcohol
sensation
sour
spin
and
tart
fruity
finish
there
are
delicate
flavors
but
the
are
masked
to
well
by
the
bold
creatures
somewhat
of
a
challenge
to
drink
all
12
but
still
worth
the
trip
notes
overall
a
very
good
beer
a
bit
daunting
in
appearance
but
much
more
mellow
in
flavor
would
have
liked
it
to
have
a
bit
more
body
update

for
my
2005
review
we
are
back
on
track
the
sourness
is
gone
the
rating
is
back
up
and
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
bottle
didnt
explode
all
over
my
kitchen
floor

abv
are
you
sure
a
wonderful
beer
to
be
had
it
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
with
the
flavors
being
more
pronounced
a
very
smooth
and
quaffable
beer
i
really
had
to
slow
myself
down
with
this
one
lest
this
concoction
disappear
too
quickly
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
one
up
reward
yourself
for
a
job
welldone

i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
it
poured
with
a
huge
head
its
very
sweet
as
others
have
noted
it
would
go
well
w
chocolate
also
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
it
does
have
a
sweet
taste
to
it
this
is
a
unique
brew
a
big
beer
a
sweet
sort
of
english
strong
ale
not
a
barleywine
definitely
good
but
surely
not
great
serve
slightly
chilled
for
best
results
this
is
a
profoundly
good
beer
the
head
is
sculpture
my
first
encounter
was
on
draft
at
floyds
in
seattle
ive
tried
batches
in
the
20s
30s40s
and
50s
with
tonight
being
52
the
last
time
was
33
this
beer
is
an
example
of
beer
as
art
it
is
beguiling
like
a
good
meal
the
components
are
so
integrated
that
no
one
element
stands
out
they
tease
the
flavour
changes
from
imperial
stout
to
harvest
ale
all
the
leatherywoody
chocolatey
flavors
dance
interchangeably
throughout
the
taste
when
i
think
i
have
a
flavor
pegged
it
changes
alan
sprints
is
an
alchemist
this
is
gold
turned
into
beer
all
of
that
being
said
and
the
st
lokis
day
massacre
being
recorded
i
would
gladly
recreate
the
event
if
i
was
to
never
see
adam
age
and
achieve
the
temperament
of
an
aged
wise
guy
lovely
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
forms
a
light
brown
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
bready
and
peppery
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
chocolate
notes
the
flavor
is
sweet
bready
raisiny
with
a
super
sweet
fruity
flavor
and
a
sweet
syrupy
finish
it
is
a
fullbodied
brew
that
is
very
tasty
outstanding
man
the
head
is
huge
on
this
puts
my
gourd
to
shame
i
had
to
wait
to
let
this
puppy
settle
a
very
dark
amber
brown
light
doesnt
find
its
way
through
very
well
a
sweet
smoky
aroma
malty
with
a
hoppiness
at
the
end
the
beer
has
a
definite
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
smokey
earthy
flavor
a
pretty
smooth
drink
considering
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
the
abv
as
you
go
further
into
this
beer
the
hop
character
becomes
more
apparent
a
slight
caramel
aftertaste
a
very
good
beer
but
not
something
that
you
can
drink
alot
of
its
a
sipper
its
very
strong
in
its
flavors
and
alcohol
and
takes
some
getting

its

before

everything
is
overtaken
by
smoke
loads
and
loads
of

rich

the
notes
of
smoke

become
dominant
profound

thick
and
continually
smokey

the
main
flavor
is
a
suggestion

glass
light
beige
foam
to

out
i
barely
noticed
the
foam
creeping
out
of
the
bottle
in
time
to
keep
it
from
ending
up
all
over
the
table
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
foam
in
the
glass
to
die
down
that
was
kind
of
irritating
it
is
never
good
when
it
takes
you
longer
to
pour

than
it
does
to

it

took
forever
to

aroma
was
a
great
blend
of
roasted

raisin
malt
and
alcohol
flavor
is
an
earthy
concoction
that
doesnt
even
bother
to
try
to
hide
the

content
very
complex
with
flavors
of
malt
fruit
caramel
vanilla
chocolate
and
a

for

its

is
ok
i
think
this
beer
was
intend
to
be
a
sipper
nice
drinkability
i
like
this
one
a
lot
really
cellarable
ive
had
it
fresh
and
aged
and
both
are
awesome
another
impressive
brew
from

tasty
easy

drink
for
a

beer
ive
never
had
a
cigar
city
beer
that
i
didnt
like
o
distinct
complex
and
interesting
would
likely
benefit
from
some
further
aging
i
need
more
of
this
this
was
a
perfect
bottle
to
open
on
this
winter
night
amazing
in
every
aspect
warmer
winter
is
the
epitome
of
cold
weather
beer
its
hearty
rich
and
most
importantly
potent
and
stacked
inside
a
22oz
bottle
a
warm
up
is
on
the
way
this
poured
with
a
very
rich
color
of
chocolate
brown
with
a
thin
layer
of
tight
knit
foam
the
nose
was
strong
with
barley
malt
and
sweet
chocolate
with
a
underpinning
of
dried
fruit
the
flavor
was
a
barley
bomb
with
huge
amounts
of
dry
yet
sweet
barley
malts
the
sweetness
eased
into
chocolate
with
a
soft
prune
finish
the
feel
was
slick
and
full
with
almost
no
carbonation
very
good
barley
wine
maybe
not
bcbw
but
really
good
od
this
was
pretty
solid
nearly
a
barleywine
and
very
pleasant
complex
and
enjoyable
while
being
way
too
easy
to
drink
hops
werent
too
harsh
in
the
profile
and
the

was

and
an

kick
on

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
quite
rich
and
boozy
one
of
the
better
straight
up
old
ales
ive
had
this
in
any
kind
of
barrel
would
most
likely
be
amazing
ive
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
ccb
overall
im
not
experienced
in
old
ales
but
this
one
will
keep
me
trying
others
it
might
be
just
a
bit
too
sweet
but
in
moderation
i
dont
think
itd
be
a
problem
with
me
i
loved
the
changing
of
smells
and
taste
i
found
that
to
be
one
of
the
fun
moments
of
the
beer
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
not
overall
that
impressed
maybe
some
wood
aged
variants
of
this
or
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
one
could
be
more
up
my
alley
a
little
too
sweet
but
it
is
definitely
a
nice
dessert
beer
as
far
as
old
ales
go
its
a
bit
different
for
the
style
pours
a
pretty
datk
amber
with
creamy
tall
head
aroma
of
candy
apples
and
a
bit
of
pine
hops
taste
is
sweet
with
malt
caramel
green
apples
a
definite
puckering
grapefruit
hop
presence
that
i
was
expecting
thick
and
chewey
mouthfeel
extremely
smooth
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
on
the
finish
very
interesting
brew
that
is
definitely
fitting
for
winter
time
o
i
like
this
beer
as
i
am
a
fan
of
old
ales
in
general
the
only
complaint
i
would
have
is
that
its
hard
to
finish
a
bomber
alone
but
with
that
said
i
did
so
its
very
sweet
and
syrupy
but
the
woody
aspect
and
grapefruit
notes
make
this
beer
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
arent
careful
i
enjoyed
it
but
definately
couldnt
drink
it
every
night
nor
could
i
drink
anything
else
after
having
this
beer
as
it
makes
you
have
a
sugar
overload
o
solventy
after
it
warms
i
am
not
impressed
and
am
considering
dumping
the
remains
of
my
glass
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
i
guess
thick
single
finger
off
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
on
a
cloudy
deep
amber
copper
body
very
nice
dark
fruit
aroma
with
fig
molasses
plum
and
raisin
with
hints
of
caramel
flavor
follows
nicely
with
more
fig
plum
raisin
and
apple
for
dark
fruit
candy
sugar
caramel
candied
citrus
and
more
hitch
borders
on
being
a
little
too
sweet
medium
body
which
is
smooth
and
oily
with
moderate
carbonation
very
flavorful
a
little
too
sweet
though
but
the
booze
are
definitely
well
hidden
a
very
well
crafted
brew
m
big
medium
overall
very
good
beer
i
am
tempted
into
buying
another
just
for
kicks
no
f
that
i
want
to
buy
more
because
it
really
good
i
have
been
growing
a
huge
liking
to
old
ales
and
this
one
has
joined
the
list
salud
overall
im
not
sure
i
loved
the
combination
of
favors
but
i
enjoyed
the
beer
enough
the
bitter
and
sweet
clashed
a
bit
in
my
opinion
poured
from
bomber
into
chalice
glass
pours
cloudy
burnt
orange
with
an
average
tan
orange
tinted
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
average
lace
the
nose
is
dominated
by
caramel
toffee
maple
and
more
caramel
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
a
lightly
burnt
note
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
of
the
bitter
burnt
note
dominated
by
caramel
toffee
maple
and
that
same
touch
of
vanilla
the
body
is
full
with
average
carbonation
and
a
long
caramel
and
lightly
bitter
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
and
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
out
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
i
like
the
full
body
and
chewy
mouthfeel
but
nothing
really
stood
out
with
this
one
overall
an
interesting
brew
definitely
a
barleywine
feel
big
bold
lots
of
layered
flavors
it
could
be
lighter
but
thats
obviously
not
what
its
going
for
absolutely
worth
picking
up
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
to
hold
onto
o
the
citrusy
aromas
are
quite
unusual
and
interesting
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
although
the
amount
of
sweetness
is
what
will
make
you
need
to
sip
this
beer
the
bottle
was
2010
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
copper
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweeet
and
boozey
lots
of
dark
fruit
notes
taste
like
it
smells
the
dark
fruit
flavors
really
shine
it
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
moderate
very
smooth
i
loved
it
can
not
wait
to
try
my
2011
bottle
o
possibly
the
sweetest
beer
ive
ever
consumed
way
out
of
balance
overall
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
this
is
true
to
the
olde
ale
style
either
aviod
this
beer
o
could
use
a
little
more
aging
but
i
think
i
plucked
it
at
an
appropriate
time
since
im
celebrating
christmas
in
june
o
too
cloying
for
me
i
like
some
aspects
of
this
beer
but
cant
get
past
the
sweetness
moreys
bottom
line
while
very
grateful
that
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
i
found
it
to
be
overly
sweet
sweet
can
be
good
but
this
was
just
a
bit
much
maybe
this
would
have
been
better
when
it
was
fresh
its
probably
safe
to
assume
that
2
years
in
the
basement
made
this
even
sweeter
than
it
originally
was
o
a
nice
combination
of
malt
and
spices
but
way
overcarbonated
and
with
too
much
residual
sweetness
o
very
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
evening
it
was
around
10
but
i
cant
remember
how
much
exactly
for
the
750
ml
not
bad
this
bottle
was
a
slight
gusher
it
poured
a
medium
bodied
dark
brown
with
plum
highlights
and
a
creamy
two
finger
beige
head
the
nose
is
very
malty
and
a
tad
sweet
its
slightly
bready
with
some
toffee
and
cherry
the
flavors
are
initially
very
sweet
with
plenty
of
cherry
biscuity
malt
molasses
sorghum
toffee
and
is
has
an
earthy
and
yeasty
finish
it
drinks
somewhere
in
between
an
old
ale
and
aged
barleywine
there
is
definitely
a
good
amount
of
sugar
it
drinks
light
and
a
little
sticky
there
isnt
any
alcohol
presence
at
all
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
share
but
drinking
an
entire
bottle
by
yourself
would
be
a
challenge
if
you
like
barleywines
this
is
definitely
up
your
alley
im
sure
a
barrel
aged
version
would
be
phenomenal
o
over
the
top
sweetness
with
little
else
going
on
i
hope
that
with
some
time
it
would
develop
dark
fruit
overtones
o
not
very
interesting
tastes
good
but
theres
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
cigar
city
just
seems
to
brew
really
sweet
beer
like
dfh
good
flavor
but
sweets
take
over
o
what
a
great
little
beer
ccbs
warmer
winter
was
the
surprise
hit
of
the
night
one
i
look
forward
to
returning
to
in
the
future
and
if
this
ever
hits
a
bourbon
barrel
the
line
forms
behind
me
not
bad
but
a
little
forgettable
sweetness
drags
it
down
a
bit
which
ive
noticed
often
with
cigar
city
o
i
thought
i
was
going
to
nurse
on
the
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
basically
take
a
couple
of
hours
and
enjoy
the
bottle
but
it
is
way
too
heavy
and
cloying
half
the
bottle
is
plenty
a
very
good
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
buy
the
next
iteration
i
would
like
a
little
more
attenuation
and
a
little
less
carbonation
it
is
just
a
little
too
richsweet
but
it
is
a
great
sippingdesert
beer
the
flavor
is
nice
with
some
citrus
from
the
hops
and
slight
caramel
body
with
a
gentle
creamines
from
the
yeast
with
hint
of
spice
and
toffee
as
mentioned
in
the
descriptors
from
the
label
the
flavor
gets
a
little
more
earthy
and
woody
as
it
goes
on
and
the
alcohol
comes
forward
rich
and
almost
meaty
with
a
hint
of
raisin
the
drinkability
is
good
for
an
11
beer
not
sure
i
would
rush
to
get
this
again
but
if
available
i
wouldnt
hesitate
i
think
it
is
a
solid
brew
and
like
that
it
doesnt
show
its
strength
all
that
much
overall
i
was
worried
when
i
saw
the
reviews
for
this
and
paid
11
for
the
bottle
but
it
was
a
good
beer
my
first
old
ale
and
it
didnt
disappoint
i
drank
one
glass
and
had
to
drain
pour
the
rest
a
thick
cloudy
dark
mahogany
brew
with
a
goodly
stubborn
oatmeal
colored
head
and
solid
lacing
the
aroma
says
brown
bread
and
sweet
pine
hop
and
medicinal
malt
oatmeal
chocolate
nuances
thick
and
chewy
and
real
high
on
the
olfactory
scale
wow
immediately
followed
by
another
wow
the
flavor
just
overwhelms
the
mouth
with
thick
herbal
hops
and
deep
dark
cereal
grain
almost
a
barleywine
deal
just
a
lush
mix
of
heavy
malt
and
evergreen
with
a
delicious
tart
hop
bite
the
body
is
full
but
not
gagging
and
tiny
carbonation
makes
for
a
silky
feel
that
caps
off
a
near
perfect
winter
brew
cigar
city
maintains
its
incredible
record
of
awesome
brewing
overall
the
carbonation
issue
is
annoying
and
the
extreme
sweetness
in
the
taste
is
slightly
offputting
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
though
it
drinks
remarkably
well
for
being
11
overall
definitely
not
my
favorite
old
ale
much
better
ones
out
there
this
way
too
sweet
for
me
this
wont
age
well
overall
what
a
complex
beer
so
many
layers
so
many
flavours
its
quite
an
impressive
brew
the
only
thing
i
dont
really
enjoy
is
the
immense
amount
of
sweetness
this
has
a
bit
over
a
year
on
it
this
beer
pours
with
a
big
billowing
head
that
recedes
to
about
a
cm
leaving
some
nice
lacing
the
liquid
is
a
very
dark
molasses
color
and
is
pretty
opaque
aroma
is
big
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
residual
tropical
fruityness
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
similar
but
is
verging
on
being
too
sweet
caramel
candy
overtakes
some
of
the
toffee
flavors
the
tropical
fruit
comes
through
more
clearly
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
prune
dark
fruit
notes
as
it
warms
it
takes
on
a
bit
of
a
robitussin
type
taste
but
not
really
in
a
bad
way
interesting
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
with
pleasant
carbonation
not
too
hot
very
nice
and
warming
and
very
smooth
as
well
very
enjoyable
beer
and
if
some
of
the
sweetness
could
be
a
bit
less
and
the
toffee
a
bit
more
this
would
have
been
more
enjoyable
for
me
this
brew
is
delicious
very
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
with
the
hop
notes
this
beer
is
creative
and
well
crafted
nice
touch
on
a
classic
style
very
complex
sweet
and
dry
at
the
same
time
its
almost
bordering
on
too
sweet
like
a
dubbel
sweetened
dark
cherries
hints
of
oranges
for
its
stature
it
sits
light
and
feels
like
cherry
syrup
a
dry
woody
oak
is
felt
upon
exhale
i
can
see
why
this
isnt
a
winter
warmer
anymore
i
might
categorize
it
more
as
a
barleywine
but
were
just
speaking
semantics
now
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
all
around
they
really
brought
all
the
flavors
together
very
well
in
it
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
to
sip
on
this
afternoon
pretty
good
fairly
rich
wouldve
been
easier
to
finish
with
a
friend
o
i
see
how
it
is
a
winter
beer
but
it
does
not
get
cold
enough
for
me
in
florida
to
see
an
ideal
drinking
experience
i
could
make
this
an
everyday
beer
up
in
michigan
though
in
the
freezing
cold
and
heavy
snow
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
will
definitely
warm
you
up
overall
very
nice
big
sugary
malty
brew
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
notes
very
enjoyable
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
it
seemed
like
all
the
right
elements
were
there
but
they
didnt
all
mesh
this
one
loses
a
lot
of
points
because
of
how
sweet
it
was
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
a
glass
of
it
let
alone
the
entire
bottle
im
glad
i
shared
it
this
is
just
way
too
sweet
and
candylike
for
me
to
want
again
this
brew
pours
a
muddy
redbrown
with
a
huge
head
that
retains
very
well
the
aroma
is
an
interesting
mix
of
toffeed
caramel
malts
and
fruits
holding
hands
with
a
fairly
strong
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
is
syrupy
sweet
at
first
with
a
really
strong
fruit
offering
it
doesnt
stay
like
that
for
too
long
though
with
a
fairly
strong
hoppiness
on
the
backend
to
help
balance
out
the
sweetness
its
still
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
though
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
quite
coating
it
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
drinkability
is
about
average
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
this
isnt
really
my
favourite
ccb
beer
which
is
saying
a
lot
for
their
quality
at
this
is
still
quite
a
good
beer
overall
too
sweet
to
be
all
that
good
the
flavors
are
there
but
some
more
fermentation
would
do
this
some
good
a
drier
earthier
lesssweet
version
of
this
could
be
quite
good
delicious
treat
o
much
sweeter
than
expected
and
very
full
and
boozy
a
great
drink
though
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
this
beer
fresh
is
supposed
to
have
some
spicy
pine
and
citrus
hops
which
might
give
it
a
little
zip
and
cut
through
the
sweetness
with
a
year
on
it
though
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
o
easily
the
one
of
the
strangest
beers
ive
had
on
my
short
ba
adventure
after
about
15
minutes
of
sipping
i
think
i
found
the
flavor
profile
tastes
like
a
ricola
natural
cough
drop
good
thing
i
like
those
o
cloyingly
sweet
too
sweet
salud
o
a
big
sticky
sweet
sipper
perfect
for
winter
very
rich
ripe
dark
fruit
notes
and
molasses
with
hints
of
lighter
fruits
11
abv
not
detected
very
complex
yikes
let
this
one
sit
a
year
or
five
it
has
massive
potential
but
is
way
to
young
do
well
thats
different
ridiculously
sweet
id
buy
the
bottle
if
someone
finished
the
whole
thing
by
themselves
worth
a
try
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
d
a
definite
sipper
lots
of
complexity
in
every
facet
a
wonderful
holiday
seasonal
definitely
has
a
warming
effect
on
the
drinker
if
the
overall
sweetness
was
dialed
down
just
a
notch
this
could
be
an
exceptional
world
class
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
and
share
ive
been
avoiding
this
brew
for
a
few
seasons
now
but
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
pours
a
big
foamy
head
over
a
mudcolored
body
head
recedes
a
bit
is
pretty
nonexistent
after
the
first
few
sips
the
nose
is
dominated
by
booze
and
chocolate
with
subtle
undertones
of
rosemary
and
some
other
spices
that
i
couldnt
put
my
thumb
on
taste
follows
the
smell
initially
booze
again
on
the
front
with
a
spicy
chocolate
backbone
subtle
hints
of
toffee
and
heavy
cream
are
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
its
quite
fizzy
on
the
front
of
your
tongue
but
finishes
pretty
clean
overall
a
good
introduction
to
old
ales
for
me
i
think
ill
cellar
my
other
bottle
for
a
while
to
see
if
the
boozy
nose
and
taste
diminish
a
bit
overall
a
nice
old
alebarley
wine
style
beer
i
was
pleased
with
the
malt
and
citrus
hop
fusion
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brownish
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
head
looks
fantastic
in
the
glass
aroma
is
pleasant
dark
fruits
spice
caramel
and
slight
smokiness
not
a
very
aromatic
smell
but
nice
taste
mirrors
the
smell
i
get
a
nice
malty
sweetness
up
front
tons
of
dark
fruits
and
spice
hitting
the
palate
finishes
with
slight
hops
that
leaves
a
semidry
finish
i
can
detect
a
slight
booziness
but
nothing
offputting
especially
for
an
11
brew
overall
a
great
winter
warmerold
ale
although
this
is
a
pretty
sweet
ale
there
is
enough
hop
bitterness
that
keeps
this
from
being
too
sweet
overall
a
pretty
nice
holiday
style
of
old
ale
which
is
favorably
spiced
thick
and
festive
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
winter
heavy
and
sweet
but
i
find
the
american
hops
clash
too
much
with
the
malt
profile
to
make
it
amazing
still
damned
fine
and
worth
a
purchase
interesting
beer
different
from
most
winter
beers
however
still
very
delicious
o
a
tasty
treat
indeed
this
is
for
sure
a
beer
that
could
be
held
onto
for
a
very
very
long
time
if
desired
tons
of
complex
character
that
is
unique
to
this
beer
and
a
great
beer
for
potential
aging
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
of
an
issue
and
it
is
a
little
overly
sweet
for
me
but
the
english
barleywine
style
i
find
is
usually
a
bit
too
sweet
the
larger
format
bottle
will
make
this
a
challenge
to
finish
a
good
beer
i
had
it
this
time
last
year
and
had
a
heard
time
finishing
it
but
i
have
come
a
long
way
since
then
lets
see
how
it
tastes
next
year
mouthfeel
was
very
thick
and
chewy
i
had
to
slowly
sip
on
the
snifter
and
that
was
enough
for
me
a
bit
sweet
for
my
palate
but
worth
trying
once
for
sure
o
while
this
was
really
good
and
impeccably
wellcrafted
i
prefer
anchors
offerings
in
09
10
way
more
than
this
one
the
beer
is
russet
brown
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
brings
toffee
malt
alcohol
nice
flavor
and
not
what
i
expected
from
a
winter
warmer
the
beer
is
sweet
and
thick
with
only
a
minimal
contribution
from
the
spices
which
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
as
many
brews
of
this
ilk
are
overly
spiced
really
sweet
and
best
in
small
quantities
a
tasty
brew
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
though
a
small
sampling
is
plenty
nursing
a
snifter
of
this
on
a
cold
winter
day
would
be
nice
o
was
hard
to
finish
due
to
sweetness
and
even
shared
we
did
not
want
more
spot
on
in
a
lot
of
areas
except
on
how
sweet
it
was
big
negatives
on
sweetness
this
one
was
a
real
surprise
to
me
as
i
was
expecting
a
straight
up
traditional
winter
warmer
and
was
greeted
by
more
of
an
old
alebarleywine
hybrid
with
some
extra
winter
warmer
character
thrown
in
for
good
measure
its
no
wonder
that
they
opt
to
often
go
into
the
barrel
with
this
one
its
definitely
got
some
presence
to
it
and
a
favorable
one
at
that
o
excellent
winter
warmer
honestly
this
one
tastes
like
a
great
barleywine
will
definitely
buy
again
ordered
a
bottle
of
this
a
few
years
ago
when
i
took
my
mom
out
for
her
birthday
to
the
bethlehem
speakeasy
the
beer
poured
out
as
what
appeared
to
be
a
very
nice
looking
red
color
i
was
having
a
hard
time
telling
since
it
was
so
dark
in
there
the
head
was
thin
and
a
little
creamy
looking
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
spicy
and
to
me
was
very
inviting
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
very
nice
spices
colliding
with
some
sweet
malts
that
create
a
nice
warming
effect
the
mouthfeel
had
a
really
nice
thickness
to
it
very
creamy
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
winter
warmer
id
love
to
try
it
again
one
day
very
nicely
done
nice
to
know
that
some
folks
in
the
sunshine
state
know
how
to
brew
this
style
winter
warmers
seldom
excite
me
but
huge
malt
bombs
that
arent
too
boozy
are
quite
a
treat
the
more
i
think
about
it
however
this
beer
is
probably
more
of
an
english
barleywine
than
a
winter
warmer
because
its
abv
is
so
high
whatever
it
is
i
might
get
my
hands
on
it
again
in
the
future
overall
the
age
did
it
good
d
honestly
was
not
an
easy
drinking
brew
and
was
a
definite
sipper
i
could
not
take
a
gulp
even
if
i
tried
to
pretty
decent
beer
though
all
around
this
beer
is
sweet
and
chewy
enough
that
it
makes
me
someone
that
doesnt
really
care
about
such
things
think
that
this
thing
must
have
a
million
calories
in
it
interestingly
enough
while
this
beer
is
a
lot
darker
and
a
lot
sweeter
i
see
the
similarity
in
flavor
profile
between
this
beer
and
lil
warmer
double
ipa
that
was
made
from
the
second
runnings
of
this
beer
for
drinking
fresh
and
enjoying
the
hops
i
would
seriously
like
to
see
the
sweetness
toned
down
in
this
beer
as
it
is
though
it
will
likely
age
quite
interestingly
for
a
long
time
assuming
it
doesnt
turn
into
a
bottle
bomb
from
all
the
available
residual
sugar
i
had
been
forewarned
about
the
excessive
sweetness
so
was
ready
for
it
additionally
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
tonight
and
this
has
certainly
fit
the
bill
i
could
actually
see
myself
really
not
enjoying
this
beer
if
i
hadnt
known
beforehand
about
the
ample
sweetness
but
as
it
is
i
am
quite
enjoying
this
beer
i
would
likely
enjoy
it
even
more
though
if
the
sweetness
was
tamed
down
considerably
o
d
when
i
was
drinking
this
i
was
told
it
was
a
barleywine
i
though
this
was
a
bizarre
barleywine
now
that
im
told
its
a
winter
warmer
it
makes
more
sense
seems
to
be
a
decent
beer
overall
its
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
other
than
that
it
definitely
lives
up
to
its
title
pours
a
pretty
brown
maroon
with
a
decent
amount
of
offwhite
head
smells
super
raisin
heavy
tns
and
tons
of
sweet
malts
and
sharp
raisin
tastes
sweet
but
overpowering
can
definitely
taste
the
booziness
on
this
one
wow
well
carbonated
and
certainly
tasty
but
a
bit
much
for
my
taste
ofor
a
long
time
on
this
site
it
was
considered
an
english
barley
wine
now
i
see
it
categorized
as
a
winter
warmer
the
bottle
labels
it
as
an
english
barley
wine
so
im
just
gonna
review
this
as
an
english
ale
to
me
its
too
sweet
to
be
a
good
winter
warmer
or
barley
wine
its
just
way
too
sweet
it
makes
this
not
too
drinkable
i
feel
it
wouldnt
be
bad
with
a
dessert
shared
among
friends
finishing
off
a
bottle
by
yourself
might
not
be
fun
i
think
might
be
best
as
a
marinade
do
this
strong
ale
aspires
to
be
like
an
old
ale
or
englishstyle
barleywine
but
is
found
to
be
poor
and
mostly
unpalatable
regardless
of
style
flavors
are
generally
disjunct
and
unrefined
more
specifically
the
sweetness
is
offensive
and
the
astringency
is
foundationshaking
like
other
strong
ales
this
must
be
slowly
sipped
but
the
less
the
sipper
considers
its
qualities
the
better
in
this
case
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
drinkability
is
between
moderate
and
high
it
takes
a
hit
for
the
higher
abv
and
it
is
a
little
excessively
sweet
but
this
really
is
a
great
beer
and
i
would
like
to
score
a
couple
more
bottles
to
age
and
see
how
it
turns
out
a
lot
a
lot
of
flavors
here
and
is
much
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
however
with
all
these
flavors
it
is
not
over
whelming
delectably
smooth
fabulously
rich
fullbodied
very
light
effervescence
the
sweetness
really
makes
this
a
great
dessert
replacement
the
smooth
malt
aftertaste
is
awesome
this
is
a
seriously
world
class
beer
a
phenomenal
brew
d
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
pretty
complex
but
a
nice
balance
to
it
as
well
great
flavors
and
good
mouthfeel
makes
this
brew
a
winner
d
pretty
sweet
for
my
liking
i
would
really
want
to
split
a
bottle
and
just
sip
it
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
it
was
even
warm
for
me
as
a
winter
warmer
here
in
florida
my
girl
liked
it
im
gonna
age
it
a
bit
and
see
what
develops
d
although
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
extremely
sweet
and
hard
to
finish
i
had
a
750ml
bottle
and
between
my
husband
and
i
we
had
a
difficult
time
drinking
it
because
of
the
overly
sweetness
i
think
if
we
had
it
with
dessert
or
split
it
between
4
people
it
would
have
been
less
of
a
problem
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
if
you
do
not
like
sweet
beers
then
avoid
this
this
is
probably
the
sweetest
beer
i
have
ever
had
kind
of
like
the
candy
of
the
beer
world
if
you
need
hops
in
your
brew
do
not
bother
with
this
one
super
sweet
malts
bury
any
other
flavors
good
but
not
great
eminently
drinkable
overall
an
interesting
fairly
complex
beer
it
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
i
liked
it
thanks
solan
overall
excellent
beer
overall
there
is
really
nothing
negative
i
can
say
about
warmer
winter
winter
warmer
perfect
for
a
cold
evening
or
a
77
degree
afternoon
like
today
in
southwest
florida
if
you
see
it
try
it
its
that
good
once
again
cigar
city
does
not
disappoint
the
more
you
drink
of
this
beer
the
easier
it
becomes
to
drink
though
i
think
it
might
be
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
glass
in
a
sitting
i
imagine
the
well
hidden
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
if
you
let
it
with
the
sweetness
it
wont
appeal
to
everyones
palate
but
as
a
seasonal
holiday
beer
it
works
perfectly
d
easydrinking
for
how
massive
it
is
bottle
shared
at
a
september
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
a
light
brown
amberish
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
fruity
with
rich
caramel
and
brown
sugar
plenty
of
sweet
raisins
and
toffee
also
some
vanilla
and
hoppy
notes
pretty
fullbodied
and
satisfying
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
its
full
bodied
lush
and
smooth
tremendous
its
full
and
robust
with
a
silky
smooth
finish
of
sweet
fruits
and

shoutout
to
luekens
liquors
online
beer
store
for
having
all
these
high
quality
cigar
city
beers
available
to
ship
to
the
northeast
d
overall
another
awesome
brew
from
ccb
that
is
great
to
enjoy
on
the
few
cold
nights
we
get
in
florida
highly
recommended
d
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
again
a
touch
too
sweet
but
delicious
nonetheless
definitely
worth
a
shot
very
sweet
right
off
the
start
loads
of
raisins
and
dark
sugars
very
little
hop
flavors
poking
through
the
chewy
sweetness
slightly
tangy
finish
with
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
nutty
and
creamy
very
good
for
a
barleywine
but
glad
i
split
a
bottle
becuase
it
does
become
a
little
overwhelming
after
awhile
m
very
silky
smooth
creamy
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
tickling
the
roof
of
my
mouth
as
i
take
a
slug
drinkability
a
sipper
and
even
with
a
year
on
it
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
warming
as
i
drink
it
honestly
more
warming
than
i
can
remember
from
many
beers
in
this
abv
range
however
that
just
psychologically
is
warming
me
up
as
i
sit
outside
and
honestly
does
not
take
away
from
its
drinkability
because
as
previously
mentioned
i
do
not
taste
any
immediate
alcohol
when
sipping
this
beer
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
wow
this
is
a
big
brew
and
a
mean
winter
warmer
i
was
expecting
something
lighter
but
this
is
roughly
a
sweeter
barley
wine
pour
is
a
lightish
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
speaks
of
a
stout
lots
of
chocolate
and
cream
cocoa
nice
alcohol
scent
taste
starts
out
a
bit
like
an
imperial
stout
but
goes
a
bit
sweeter
like
a
milk
stout
or
some
belgian
riss
has
some
bitterness
making
this
more
of
a
strong
ale
but
with
some
hints
of
an
english
barley
wine
very
complex
brew
and
a
really
pleasant
mix
to
the
usual
winter
styles
drinkabilitythis
is
a
hugely
drinkable
winter
warmer
very
thick
and
rich
amazing
sweet
flavors
great
as
a
dessert
beer
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
like
big
beers
this
beer
definitely
delivers
overall
last
years
was
better
for
some
reason
too
sweet
for
me
and
lacked
balance
the
appearance
is
a
dark
murky
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
half
inch
white
head
smells
of
sweet
brown
sugar
and
maybe
some
molasses
you
can
also
definitely
smell
the
booze
taste
for
me
was
just
too
sweet
very
sugary
and
tart
with
a
nice
boozey
background
creamy
mouthfeel
but
for
me
the
sweetness
was
just
too
much
i
cant
really
describe
the
type
of
sweetness
that
well
i
do
like
some
sweet
beers
like
creme
brulee
but
this
one
just
had
an
awkward
sweetness
to
it
my
least
favorite
brew
from
cigar
city
as
of
yet
d
drinkability
once
again
comes
down
to
how
much
did
you
like
it
and
how
much
would
you
like
to
have
another
if
you
could
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
its
fairly
strong
to
boot
but
more
importantly
its
very
sweet
i
drank
two
10
oz
glasses
and
my
palate
was
overwhelmed
with
flavor
id
certainly
have
another
though
and
its
unique
enough
that
id
say
its
certainly
worth
trying
d
this
is
a
very
good
ole
ale
thanks
to
given2flybrewing
for
sharing
this
one
too
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
being
my
first
taste
of
a
ccb
brew
im
kind
of
scratching
my
head
regarding
all
the
hubbub
though
drinkability
quite
good
a
little
too
hopforward
for
my
tastes
but
its
very
drinkable
and
interesting
enough
for
me
to
stay
engaged
while
i
may
not
bend
over
backwards
for
a
second
bottle
im
glad
i
had
the
first
md
a
bit
thick
leaves
a
cooling
alcohol
tingle
could
definitely
use
some
taming
cigar
city
makes
some
great
brews
and
their
beefed
up
old
ale
is
ok
probably
wont
grab
this
one
again
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
a
moderate
caramel
color
singlefinger
white
head
recedes
somewhat
quickly
but
leaves
a
few
legs
and
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
is
really
fruity
with
large
amounts
of
raisins
figs
and
stone
fruits
good
dose
of
caramel
and
booze
as
well
the
taste
focuses
on
fruit
and
alcohol
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
feel
is
a
bit
boozy
but
melds
well
with
the
flavors
a
nice
sipper
d
this
isnt
horrible
but
not
great
i
think
its
decent
as
far
as
a
winter
warmer
goes
but
wouldnt
seek
this
out
if
your
not
a
huge
spice
beer
fan
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
as
it
introduces
you
to
the
style
or
gives
you
just
enough
spice
to
get
the
style
but
not
so
much
you
cant
drink
a
good
amount
mild
recommendation
extremely
drinkable
carbonation
is
perfect
and
lusty
d
this
one
is
giving
me
a
bit
of
trouble
was
hoping
it
would
be
more
of
a
malt
bomb
but
it
came
forward
with
some
hops
for
me
an
old
ale
is
like
drinking
caramel
syrup
it
has
a
certain
viscosity
that
i
want
and
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
that
a
bit
too
crisp
ive
had
this
one
once
before
a
while
back
glad
to
see
it
held
up
as
well
blind
really
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
over
an
hour
of
taking
it
easy
during
the
cooler
months
d
easy
to
drink
tasty
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
like
almost
every
other
ccb
beverage
ive
had
its
unique
worth
a
shot
bitter
grapefruit
mingles
with
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
hop
bitterness
offsets
the
rich
profile
making
it
sweet
without
being
overbearing
wow
this
is
pretty
damn
good
my
preconceived
notions
were
far
off
the
beer
finishes
with
dates
spices
sweet
caramel
pine
and
moderately
bitter
grapefruit
and
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
with
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
great
old
ale
overall
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
one
with
some
age
on
it
dwell
not
sure
i
would
sit
down
and
drink
a
bunch
of
this
you
definitely
can
taste
the
burn
in
this
one
not
the
hunahpu
i
was
hoping
to
try
first
but
a
nice
introduction
to
cigar
city
recommended
da
little
hot
but
a
nice
complexity
to
it
well
balanced
and
big
bold
flavors
lose
the
booze
and
it
would
have
been
pretty
solid
very
deep
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
big
rocky
ecru
colored
head
aromas
of
cocoa
caramel
and
spicy
earthy
hops
on
the
palate
malt
dominates
in
a
very
good
way
with
brown
sugar
raisins
and
caramel
accented
nicely
by
zesty
citrusy
hops
an
excellent
old
ale
and
something
to
look
forward
to
for
those
forced
to
endure
floridas
winters
d
this
brew
doesnt
taste
like
10
it
wont
be
too
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
just
wish
i
had
the
whole
bottle
to
myself
the
flavor
profile
was
just
delicious
chestnut
brown
in
colorgood
sized
head
that
fades
though
their
is
still
an
ongoing

upfront
flavorwise
very
toffee
like
some
hop
bitterness
again
the
dried
fruit
has
a
definate
nuttiness
to
it
as
well
very
and
i
mean
very
slight
alcohol
tinge
very
solid
and
full
mouthfeelborders
on
creamy
really
a
solid
beer
all
around
almost
too
easy
to
drink
worth
laying
some
down
as
well
i
would
think
added
noted
as
it
warms
so
does
the
alcohol
sensation
my
chest
and
stomach
are
now
nicely
toasty
and
feeling
good
overall
a
decent
old
ale
better
than
others
but
i
still
think
hotd
makes
their
old
ale
near
the
top
of
the
style
ccb
made
a
nice
offering
with
this
one
i
am
happy
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
fairly
drinkable
tired
of
imperial
stouts
for
cold
weather
well
try
out
wwww
overall
i
remain
consistently
impressed
with
cigar
city
beers
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
despite
its
sweetness
and
it
makes
a
very
nice
dessert
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice

creamy
light

some
nice
small

the

notes
in
the
finish
nice
touch
of
chocolatetoffee
medium
body
at
10
abv
its
hidden
pretty
well
very
drinkable
another
very
nice
brew
from
cc
the
beer
is
more
carbonated
than
expected
which
is
a
pleasant
surprise
it
is
a
little
light
bodied
for
an
old
ale
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
has
a
nice
dry
finish
this
beer
is
complex
well
balanced
and
the
10
abv
is
very
well
hidden
i
will
have
no
problem
drinking
the
entire
bottle
and
i
will
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
in
the
future
as
well
as
all
the
barrel
aged
versions
this
beer
turned
melissa
on
to
old
ales
and
i
have
to
agree
that
it
was
quite
well
made
the
body
is
phenomenal
and
i
like
the
texture
that
the
carbonation
brings
on
definitely
drinkable
due
to
the
fresh
taste
and
light
carbonation
i
am
sure
time
would
not
hurt
this
one
as
it
is
mostly
sweet
malt
flavors
and
some
spices
which
i
cannot
identify
overall
one
of
the
best
things
i
have
had
from
ccb
hands
down
this
was
beyond
a
winner
for
me
and
i
am
thrilled
to
have
another
bottle
to
go
back
to
hard
to
say
if
it
will
get
better
as
it
was
darn
near
perfect
now
i
must
try
in
my
opinion
if
you
are
big
on
the
style
d
its
a
decent
old
ale
i
bet
it
will
get
better
with
time
ruby
red
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
nice
lacing
this
is
one
goodlooking
beer
especially
for
an
old
ale
the
nose
is
great
caramel
brown
sugar
and
plenty
hoppy
with
earthy
hops
quite
sweet
theres
some
spice
too
with
nutmeg
and
some
alcohol
the
palate
opens
big
and
sweet
with
honey
caramel
toffee
and
an
earthy
bitterness
leafy
and
petrichorlike
full
in
body
with
low
carbonation
this
is
solid
finishing
sweet
with
flavors
of
toffee
and
a
leafy
hop
character
i
find
the
sweetness
very
pleasant
its
far
from
cloying
spice
is
present
lingering
on
the
finish
great
body
id
drink
this
again
an
ok
sipper
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
d
thought
this
was
pretty
good
nice
sweet
caramel
and
malt
smell
or
taste
would
try
again
decent
drinkability
overall
a
very
unique
and
interesting
winter
warmer
once
again
cigar
city
impresses
the
sweetness
got
to
me
in
the
end
even
with
the
significant
hop
presence
it
became
a
bit
cloying
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
medium
body
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
somewhat
warming
could
use
some
age
date
currant
alcohol
fig
caramel
citric
hops
offsetting
rye
very
slight
oxidation
which
more
would
be
better
very
elaborate
hops
drying
and
a
somewhat
cloying
sweetness
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
in
a
year
d
this
isnt
my
favorite
cigar
city
brew
im
not
sure
the
high
hop
bitterness
meshes
well
with
the
traditional
old
ale
flavors
and
things
end
up
seeming
muddled
rather
than
complex
im
curious
if
this
was
better
fresh
when
the
citrus
was
more
present
i
can
imagine
it
creating
a
sort
of
terrys
chocolate
orange
vibe
definitely
not
your
typical
old
ale
and
glad
i
split
it
three
ways
as
750ml
would
have
been
way
too
much
drinkability
beyond
some
slight
alcohol
warmth
here
and
there
this
one
goes
down
fairly
gently
a
pleasant
enjoyable
brew
for
the
winter
months
be
it
in
the
snowy
north
or
sunsoaked
south
that
being
said
holy
jesus
this
is
a
good
beer
this
makes
me
want
to
go
out
side
and
streak
btw
do
you
think
kfc
is
still
open
this
beer
has
an
akward
nose
to
it
sorta
malty
but
then
an
odd
sweet
almost
like
citrus
this
is
a
true
winter
in
florida
even
better
cigar
city
just
increased
their
capacity
in
tampa
and
will
be
able
to
share
more
of
this
wonderful
seasonal
beer
to
the
rest
of
the
state
grab
it
now
its
really
good
its
weird
chocolatey
in
the
front
middle
is
citrusy
goodness
and
then
smack
have
some
coffee
i
look
forward
to
more
cigar
citys
great
job
i
actually
drank
half
of
it
and
that
vacuvind
the
other
half
so

one
i
suppose
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
get
too
excited
this
is
my
first
ccb
beer
and
so
far
i
am
underwhelmed
they
tried
to
do
too
much
on
this
one
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
huge
pillowy
tan
head
that
left
crazy
sick
lacing
on
the
glass
big
and
chunky
the
aroma
is
sweet
fermented
raisins
and
fig
prunes
molasses
and
honey
some
piney
and
tropical
fruit
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
of
a
big
rich
malt
light
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
followed
by
the
piney
and
tropical
fruit
hop
characteristics
the
rest
of
the
flavor
is
rounded
out
with
candied
oranges
fig
and
booze
soaked
prunes
the
feel
is
big
heavy
and
chewy
very
sweet
overall
and
sticky
a
touch
of
bitterness
pops
through
in
the
finish
not
a
spicy
winter
warmer
but
a
sweet
one
the
old
ale
label
seems
to
be
spot
on
great
body
and
nice
boozy
sweetness
that
you
typically
see
in
old
ales
the
brew
could
use
an
offset
like
some
smokeywoody
flavor
or
more
of
a
roasted
malt
still
very
good
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
and
yes
apparently
they
have
a
version
of
this
in
their
humidor
series
as
well
i
really
want
to
get
me
some
of
that
nice
effort
huge
head
even
with
a
semipassive
pour
up
over
three
fingers
of
deep
tan
foam
accompanied
by
larger
bubbles
of
varied
sizes
extremely
slow
to
dissipate
strong
webbing
of
lace
left
behind
all
over
the
glass
sides
as
a
result
you
have
to
wait
some
time
to
even
get
the
scents
able
to
show
then
golden
raisin
fig
milk
chocolate
these
contrasted
nicely
by
white
pepper
crushed
clove
dried
hay
pine
cone
suggestion
of
white
citrus
most
compelling
is
not
so
much
the
role
call
of
scents
but
the
constant
interplay
among
them
fullbodied
bottom
heavy
and
once
it
gets
into
your
mouth
only
moves
when
prodded
apricot
red
cherry
raisin
fig
pear
fruit
spiced
up
by
nutmeg
clove
allspice
and
a
touch
of
cumin
cola
nut
and
vanilla
bean
present
and
accounted
for
the
brown
sugar
element
has
a
somewhat
caramelized
cooked
quality
to
it
plenty
of
downy
fluff
in
the
carbonation
lacks
the
muscles
to
lift
things
up
into
the
air
very
subtle
grassiness
at
the
end
soaks
up
some
of
the
extra
sugar
no
arrow
left
unused
in
its
quiver
when
all
is
said
and
done
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
a
little
stickiness
drinkability
is
very
good
but
one
bomber
will
do
me
just
fine
10
abv
is
very
well
hidden
yet
warms
the
body
and
mind
as
a
good
winter
warmer
should
real
good
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
less
than
cola
brown
with
a
nice
big
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
reasonable
amount
of
lacing
behind

the
smell
is
a
crazy
intense
balance
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
chocolate
caramel
totally
loven
it
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
full
bodied
lightly
carbonated
yet
tangy
of
alcohol
and
creamy
smooth
full
flavored
the
hoppy
balanced
sweetness
lightly
smokey

taste
lingers
nicely
the
10
abv
is
a
welcomed
benny
a
real
easy
drinker
go
for
it
a
beautiful
beer
d
one
glass
is
enough
and
this
one
is
best
shared
d
an
extremely
drinkable
old
ale
drinkabilty
after
hearing
not
so
good
things
about
this
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweethop
combo
this
brew
has
to
offer
d
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
to
the
point
that
heather
asked
me
three
times
what
the
abv
was
and
shook
her
head
each
time
after
i
told
her
d
not
particularly
so
im
honestly
having
a
bit
of
trouble
getting
through
it
an
interesting
introduction
to

still
overly

d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
of
a
winter
warmer
the
alcohol
is
pretty
potent
here
but
there
is
plenty
of
other
flavors
and
aromas
happening
to
keep
it
from
becoming
too
heavyhanded
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
on
the
spicy
side
although
it
was
still
enjoyable
a
very
good
beer
a
tummy
warmer
so
definitely
hit
the
spot
on
the
this
one
when
the
temp
has
been
stuck
in
the
40s
for
days
in
florida
this
is
something
to
pick
up
enjoy
drinkability
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
i
like
it
but
somethings
not
quite
jiving
well
with
me
about
it
its
not
that
its
not
pungent
or
flavorful
which
is
a
problem
i
have
with
some
winter
warmers
this
ones
strong
and
pungent
in
all
aspects
but
its
disjointed
there
are
a
lot
of
powerful
strong
notes
that
dont
seem
to
meld
together
really
that
being
said
its
not
really
a
huge
knock
represented
by
my
scores
perhaps
with
a
little
big
of
age
on
it
this
would
be
a
world
class
old
ale
a
capped
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
10
poured
into
my
tumbler
the
ale
appears
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
about
a
finger
or
so
of
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
caramel
semisweet
chocolate
raisins
mild
pine
citrus
figs
dates
medium
to
full
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
surprisingly
not
much
alcohol
heat
here
quite
drinkable
kept
me
wanting
another
pour
wish
i
had
one
to
age
this
beer
is
hitting
all
the
right
notes
on
a
balmy
florida
evening
salud
d
exceptional
a
most
exquisite
delicious
sipper
to
drink
this
is
an
honor
and
a
privilege
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
fruity
and
perfume
flavors
are
just
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
though
very
hop
forward
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
earthy
dry
pine
and
citrus
notes
hints
of
lemon
peel
and
grapefruit
mostly
this
flavor
and
dry
mouthfeel
lingers
pretty
much
throughout
but
is
countered
midpalate
by
a
sweet
malt
profile
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
subtle
chocolate
slightly
vinous
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
mostly
grape
plum
and
raisin
very
complex
but
a
bit
unbalanced
with
possibly
to
prominent
of
a
dry
piny
hop
character
this
will
probably
open
up
nicely
as
it
ages
and
the
hops
fade
allowing
the
other
flavors
to
shine
through
the
high
abv
is
excellently
masked
making
this
a
very
quafable
beer
that
is
a
refreshingly
unique
take
on
the
style
drink
is
good
a
bit
chewy
may
make
this
a
nonsessionable
brew
but
a
damn
good
taster
and
a
perfect
beer
for
these
low
ass
tempratures
weve
been
having
i
really
picked
a
great
beer
to
be
my
first
one
of
2010
when
i
bought
this
i
hoped
it
would
be
worth
the
10
bucks
i
spent
on
it
and
it
really
was
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
of
these
for
sure
if
i
can
find
them
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
only
just
above
average
the
booziness
of
the
brew
limits
it
emensely
cigar
city
has
done
better
jobs
of
hiding
the
strength
of
their
brews
in
the
past
overall
pretty
solid
for
the
style
definately
a
sipper
and
one
for
a
cool
night
skal
flavor
wow
very
sweet
raisins
cherries
huge
roasted
malts
and
booze
caramel
flavors
as
well
very
sweet
and
creamy
mouthful
nice
complexity
and
lower
carbonation
very
tasty
beer
pouted
into
a
little
tasting
glass
pours
thick
brown
with
a
mocha
tan
head
nice
and
roasted
aroma
toffee
caramel
chocolate
bit
of
sweetness
several
citrus
notes
in
the
smell
and
very
sweet
in
taste
thick
beer
with
medium
carb
poured
into
a
pint
glass
left
about
two
fingers
of
light
tan
head
has
a
sweet
malt
smell
there
is
a
slight
roasted
character
to
the
aroma
with
hints
of
toffee
there
is
a
noticeable
alcohol
character
on
the
front
end
which
is
not
surprising
at
10
but
it
mellows
as
the
sip
progresses
has
a
nice
rich
sweetness
that
is
on
the
heavier
side
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
roasted
malt
character
is
even
slighter
in
the
taste
as
it
is
overpowered
by
the
sweetness
this
one
is
hard
for
me
to
pinpoint
the
flavors
in
the
sweet
character
but
overall
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nice
to
try
a
winter
warmer
that
is
different
than
others
d
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
thoroughly
succeeds
in
its
role
as
a
winter
warmer
the
malt
character
is
excellent
it
compares
well
to
the
best
english
and
american
examples
of
the
style
with
a
complex
blend
of
dark
sugar
and
roastedcaramel
malts
the
hops
balance
well
and
the
strong
fruity
character
is
an
unusual
twist
on
what
i
would
normally
expect
in
this
sort
of
beer
the
fruit
character
works
especially
in
the
aroma
nevertheless
i
cant
help
but
think
that
a
more
traditional
pine
or
earthy
hop
character
might
have
made
for
a
more
balanced
and
subtle
flavor
profile
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
be
really
interested
to
see
how
one
would
mellow
and
age
for
next
year

to

a

up

is
a

odd
to
me
not

just
different
completely
agree
with
the
other
reviewers
on
the
well
hidden

characteristic
d
the

definitely

this
beer
is
so
good
i
could
certainly
get
myself
into
trouble
without
even
knowing
it
d
ringing
in
10
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
from
a
pure
drinkability
standpoint
great

rather

this
is

i
will
buy
quite
a

cheers
dont
know
if
it
was
meant
to
taste
like
this
or
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
did
not
like
this
one
bit
i
like
port
wine
mind
you
but
this
beer
did
not
do
it
for
me
as
i
kept
looking
at
this
brew
in
the
snifter
i
continued
to
remind
myself
that
based
on
how
much
i
payed
for
this
bottle
i
had
better
force
myself
to
finish
it
no
sir
i
wouldnt
order
this
again
ill
buy
a
few
more
bottles
on
my

well

and
enjoyable
brew
nice
overall
this
was
better
than
expected
especially
after
the
cork
fiasco
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
the
age
made
this
beer
super
smooth
and
flavors
that
remain
are
wonderful
not
entirely
complex
but
tasty
for
sure
worth
drinking
4
this
was
honestly
3
or
4
sips
and
then
a
drainpour
stay
away
its
not
worth
the
gamble
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
and
more
body
nice
oaky
edge
but
a
bit
lacking
in
the
foundation
o
this
was
an
amazing
experience
ive
seen
this
stuff
over
and
over
again
in
my
local
beer
store
and
i
never
picked
it
up
but
this
is
a
beer
thats
meant
to
be
a
special
treat
and
at
6
99
i
consider
it
a
bargain
the
thing
is
though
this
isnt
a
beer
this
is
a
slab
of
old
england
upon
smelling
and
tasting
it
youre
immediately
transported
back
not
to
1998
but
perhaps
a
century
before
true
its
wine
counterpart
may
have
a
better
flavor
but
i
find
it
incredible
that
beer
can
even
taste
or
make
you
feel
this
way
i
cant
say
whether
ill
buy
this
again
but
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
must
have
for
anyone
who
loves
beer
and
the
great
history
behind
it
overall
brilliant
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
it
seems
like
its
lost
a
little
body
over
the
years
but
the
flavor
is
unbelievable
it
is
rich
mature
and
beautiful
i
am
very
fortunate
to
have
stumbled
across
a
bottle
4
55
overall
its
genuinely
pretty
good
and
better
than
that
the
age
has
made
it
odd
in
unusual
and
very
interesting
ways
im
not
sure
if
it
was
really
great
when
it
was
young
but
its
certainly
a
pretty
compelling
experience
when
its
old
overall
an
unpleasant
bottle
shouldnt
discourage
you
from
trying
another
because
a
good
one
is
well
worth
enjoying
one
of
the
better
aged
beers
ive
had
maybe
maybe
this
was
once
a
good
beer
and
according
to
some
reviews
it
was
but
time
has
not
been
kind
in
this
case
incredible
that
they
could
make
beer
taste
like
a
port
wine
got
some
extra
points
for
this
i
stand
by
my
comments
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
think
it
was
well
past
its
bestby
date
the
flavors
that
come
from
this
old
ale
are
astonishing
as
it
has
a
peppermint
sweetness
a
menthol
briskness
and
then
a
candied
fruit
sweetness
many
may
not
like
this
combination
in
their
ale
but
i
found
it
quite
alluring
very
interesting
and
nice
to
drink
this
is
a
surprisingly
light
bodied
brew
that
is
still
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
not
showing
its
age
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
the
alcohol
is
still
vibrant
in
this
and
i
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
despite
the
packaging
failure
that
is
thise
corked
9oz
bottles
i
will
try
to
plan
a
vertical
of
younger
vintages
i
dont
think
this
one
12
years
is
worth
a
second
try
however

vinegary
acidity
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
zero
carbonation
and
a
slight
oiliness
overall
a
muddled
mess
and
past
its
prime
not
quite
a
drain
pour
but
im
glad
i
didnt
pick
up
the
1997
vintage
gales
prize
old
ale
warms
well
to
clarify
the
aroma
and
flavor
profiles
it
is
well
suited
for
a
cozy
afternoon
of
reading
and
is
the
epitome
of
a
sipping
beer
just
popped
bottle
4651
from
the
1996
vintage
still
pretty
damn
amazing
o
overall
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
drank
only
reason
why
overall
is
not
a
1
is
because
the
aroma
was
good
if
not
absurdly
misleading
disgustingly
bad
o
feels
like
im
drinking
wine
after
a
while
i
warmed
up
to
the
taste
and
body
but
i
practically
had
to
hold
my
nose
drinking
this
2007
vintage
well
if
this
were
a
true
prizewinner
rather
than
something
prized
by
the
creator
would
it
compare
to
the
massive
achievement
of
pabsts
blue
ribbon
way
back
when
lets
see
this
stuff
pours
a
slightly
brackish
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
glowing
offkhaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
red
wine
grapes
oaky
toffee
a
hint
of
walnut
a
breeze
of
earthy
greens
a
sprig
of
spearmint
and
a
strain
of
vanilla
through
the
back
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
grapes
still
lightly
tart
are
forced
to
a
more
background
role
though
not
exactly
in
the
background
itself
in
favor
of
a
sweeter
richer
slightly
butteryer
toffee
in
fact
a
general
sweetness
pervades
until
those
grapes
force
a
tannic
tartness
through
and
help
dissipate
everything
in
a
cloud
theres
also
a
sense
of
spiciness
in
there
as
well
one
composed
mainly
of
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
but
its
mostly
muted
and
so
doesnt
really
clash
with
everything
else
fading
instead
with
that
aforementioned
cloud
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
eversoslightly
vinous
feel
overall
a
lovely
complex
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
fresh
one
to
compare
it
to
but
im
prepared
to
say
that
the
past
five
years
have
been
quite
good
to
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
future
engagements
with
various
incarnations

noticed
after

overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
old
ale
some
good
flavor
complexity
with
decent
balance
though
a
bit
cloying
it
was
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
this
was
fairly
enjoyable
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
as
i
love
old
ales
i
chipped
the
bottle
trying
to
get
the
cork
out
it
poured
with
absolutely
no
head
despite
pouring
it
slow
it
has
the
aroma
of
a
belgian
quad
with
a
hazy
reddish
brown
coloring
flavor
was
a
bit
solventy
with
hint
of
raisins
and
prunes
very
thin
body
and
watery
mouth
feel
hard
to
finish
this
is
very
flat
i
believe
this
may
have
been
exposed
to
oxygen
thus
the
strong
port
flavors
so
i
cant
tell
if
this
is
ruined
or
intended
to
be
like
this
if
it
is
intended
i
am
disappointed
it
is
sugary
and
rich
frankly
this
is
nearly
undrinkable
the
aftertaste
is
similar
to
drinking
a
sherry
wonderfully
complex
aroma
the
flavor
was
more
tart
and
the
tartness
grows
as
it
warms
a
little
weird
but
very
good
ill
let
my
other
bottle
go
a
few
more
years
before
i
try
it
again
aside
from
the
lack
of
any
head
this
is
one
tasty
brew
subtle
yet
distinctive
complexity
throughout
and
very
very
wellbalanced
with
the
flavors
ive
gotta
get
me
mitts
on
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
beer
i
would
love
to
sip
on
this
during
the
winter
months
when
we
have
a
wood
fire
crackling
in
the
fireplace
conclusion
looks
like
muddy
water
tastes
pretty
awesome
for
an
old
beer
i
wish
i
could
know
how
old
this
is
too
old
for
my
liking
cut
its
age
in
half
and
we
might
be
onto
something
drinks
sort
of
like
a
wine
or
juice
because
of
the
missing
carbonation
and
the
phenol
fruit
notes
worth
a
shot
at
6
and
14
years
old
but
not
a
new
favorite
by
any
means
really
seems
to
get
harsh
after
each
sip
would
like
to
post
this
review
so
others
thinking
of
buying
it
can
decide
to
get
a
newer
vintage
but
hate
to
give
it
a
numeric
score
since
its
not
a
fair
tasting
will
settle
for
3s
all
around
since
na
is
not
allowed
500
ml
bottle
2007
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
dark
and
sour
fruit
caramel
and
some
bready
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
brown
sugar
however
it
tastes
mostly
like
slightly
tart
dark
fruit
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
has
good
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
nothing
impressive
about
it
but
its
certainly
not
bad
either
maybe
another
vintage
of
this
would
be
better
since
i
dont
think
aging
this
one
longer
would
help
this
brew
improve
much
o
this
is
really
interesting
id
like
to
try
newer
vintages
o
enjoyable
and
interesting
but
there
is
just
too
much
alcohol
presence
for
this
one
to
be
easy
to
drink
this
would
probably
be
a
much
more
enjoyable
beer
sitting
by
the
fireplace
and
sipping
on
a
cold
winter
afternoon
than
in
the
middle
of
summer
even
in
frigid
ac
note
2005
vintage
notes
very
notable
i
also
had
the
2002
not
long
ago
and
if
anything
different
i
remember
a
better
appearance
but
nothing
that
would
set
them
significantly
apart
im
guessing
better
on
cask
while
this
is
on
the
same
path
as
old
ale
it
just
seems
to
try
too
much
it
says
on
the
rear
label
that
it
should
be
stored
on
the
side
the
store
i
bought
it
from
did
not
have
it
that
way
but
why
did
the
brewer
not
use
a
bottle
cap
fail
this
is
another
beer
that
i
think
is
way
past
its
best
by
date
still
interesting
but
its
best
days
are
clearly
behind
it
imho
o
quite
the
sipper
a
unique
ale
from
start
to
finish
pours
a
thick
murky
dark
brown
with
absolutely
no
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
oxidized
sherryport
and
some
cork
aromas
taste
is
salty
with
malt
earth
rotten
fruit
and
cork
flavors
this
beer
has
zero
carbonation
and
is
super
flat
not
even
the
slightest
hint
of
carbonation
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
pretty
horrible
beer
all
around
i
had
high
hopes
when
the
cork
came
out
clean
and
intact
but
i
guess
i
didnt
luck
out
a
very
challenging
and
complex
brew
but
well
worth
the
effort
to
try
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
much
younger
version
of
this
this
shows
up
in
the
reviews
that
list
vintage
too
apparently
2001
is
drinking
pretty
well
right
now
while
1996
is
bad
still
dont
bother
trying
this
vintage
at
this
point
not
worth
it
i
think
i
got
lucky
with
this
particular
bottle
and
i
have
one
more
of
the
same
vintage
but
this
ones
too
old
for
school
o
what
a
delight
and
at
the
modest
price
of
4
at
my
local
shop
i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
find
one
drinkability
smoother
and
milder
than
the
9
abv
would
indicate
nice
sipper
that
makes
a
nice
diversion
or
accent
not
something
i
would
go
to
over
and
over
o
perhaps
a
decent
beer
but
this
is
just
too
old
being
flat
and
oxidized
doesnt
do
it
any
favors
perhaps
will
try
a
more
recent
vintage
and
rereview
beer
is
sweet
papery
oxidized
harsh
thin
in
the
finish
not
a
repeat
avoid
this
vintage
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
really
at
all
thin
thin
collar
without
much
going
on
the
nose
carries
some
cardboard
and
a
bit
of
booze
sweetness
as
well
plenty
of
malt
flavor
has
loads
of
wet
cardboard
and
booze
some
malt
sweetness
medium
flat
body
meh
the
beer
is
flat
and
appears
a
light
brown
hue
the
aroma
offers
old
dank
basement
cardboard
malt
booze
the
flavor
is
just
not
appealing
old
boozy
liquor
dipped
in
cardboard
devoid
of
carbonation
and
off
putting
on
the
palate
i
have
tried
this
beer
several
times
over
the
last
several
years
and
have
yet
to
have
a
positive
experience
avoid
notes
where
do
i
begin
this
beer
is
in
a
category
by
itself
rich
mellow
delicious
i
am
so
sad
that
it
went
by
so
quickly
i
will
buy
more
and
cellar
o
these
beers
do
not
hold
up
very
well
o
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
it
was
flat
and
the
alcoholport
wine
in
the
taste
dominated
and
made
it
hard
to
rpink
a
9
oz
bottle
of
it
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
an
interesting
beer
given
a
little
carbonation
and
a
concentration
of
aroma
and
flavor
in
stead
of
massive
dilution
this
could
be
much
more
enjoyable
i
think
this
one
was
aged
a
little
too
long
damn
shame
interesting
and
a
fun
drink
but
nothing
great
theres
a
reason
this
is
a
classic
example
of
an
old
aleincredible
layers
of
dried
fruit
and
malt
with
subtle
sherryoxidation
notesat
14
years
old
this
beer
wears
its
age
well
so
basically
these
seem
to
lose
drinkability
as
the
vintages
get
younger
i
have
to
assume
this
is
related
to
how
they
were
stored
at
some
point
or
something
to
that
effect
the
1996
is
a
clear
standout
the
other
vintages
havent
held
up
very
well
no
pop
heard
when
uncorked
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
border
lining
on
black
no
head
whatsoever
maybe
60
bubbles
present
circling
the
rim
and
they
are
gone
in
seconds
smells
entirely
of
boozy
dark
fruits
with
plums
and
raisins
dominating
what
no
doubt
is
a
great
nose
first
sip
is
all
raisins
plums
and
figs
i
am
struck
by
the
total
lack
of
carbonation
as
this
one
feels
like
a
wine
also
noteworthy
is
the
total
lack
of
any
lacing
though
not
your
typical
old
ale
there
is
plenty
of
complexity
here
to
make
this
one
worth
seeking
i
like
old
ales
so
im
not
a
newcomer
to
the
style
or
naive
about
what
they
should
taste
like
this
one
was
plainly
ruined
an
awful
beer
and
one
of
the
few
drain
pours
ive
performed
in
my
life
that
was
just
the
last
13
of
the
beer
too
gave
it
a
chance
let
it
warm
completely
kept
sipping
nope
yuck
steer
clear
o
im
really
glad
i
got
this
i
was
expecting
something
a
lot
worse
with
something
this
old
its
not
something
id
drink
everyday
though
4
m4
d
smooth
and
almost
lubricating
in
texture
against
a
surprisingly
light
body
while
there
is
almost
no
sign
of
alcohol
detectable
on
the
palate
notable
that
barely
two
years
have
passed
since
this
ale
was
bottled
not
a
very
tasty
or
quite
complex
old
ale
as
i
would
wish
it
to
be
but
the
supremely
mellow
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
very
approachable
ale
worth
slow
savouring
like
a
good
cup
of
chinese
dark
tea
i
heard
fullers
would
keep
on
with
production
of
this
stuff
in
chiswick
and
itll
be
interesting
to
see
whether
and
what
the
new
brewery
shall
bring
to
the
strengths
of
this
very
old
recipe
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
hint
of
head
that
retains
alright
the
aroma
is
strong
with
caramel
and
cherries
the
taste
is
strong
with
figs
cherries
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
velvety
and
doesnt
finish
harsh
at
all
overall
a
great
beer
that
everyone
should
try
overall
this
is
a
wholly
unique
and
incredible
beer
after
14
years
this
has
gained
an
impeccable
complexity
a
lot
like
a
nice
port
wine
oakey
and
full
of
rich
fruit
so
glad
i
tried
this
overall
it
was
good
i
would
certainly
drink
another
not
for
everyone
but
a
gem
for
those
who
can
appreciate
it
should
be
tasted
at
room
temp
quite
tart
almost
to
a
distracting
level
but
theres
plenty
to
like
here
warming
booze
and
buttery
toffee
somewhat
smooth
out
the
tartness
lots
of
sherry
and
vinous
flavors
a
slippery
and
smooth
body
very
little
carbonation
but
you
wont
really
miss
it
pleasant
notions
of
cherry
pie
figs
and
chocolate
make
periodic
appearances
overall
impression
not
a
bad
old
ale
here
id
like
to
try
this
one
both
younger
and
older
for
comparison
thick
syrupy
and
completely
flat
without
any
sign
of
carbonation
at
all
sticky
sweet
with
a
huge
blast
of
booze
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
sweet
finish
with
warmth
in
the
chest
slight
diacetylyes
i
know
what
that
means
with
plenty
of
leathery
malt
caramel
and
toffee
again
im
picking
up
that
sweet
apple
presence
found
in
the
aroma
making
this
beer
taste
like
a
boozy
caramel
apple
the
combination
of
it
being
cloyingly
sweet
and
total
lack
of
carbonation
turns
this
into
a
drain
pour
pretty
quickly
for
a
beer
that
is
supposed
to
aged
gracefully
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
it
seems
to
have
completely
fallen
apart
vintage
2007
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
this
one
and
one
that
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
hype
its
a
decent
enough
old
ale
but
i
prefer
mine
malty
and
full
bodied
i
cant
see
aging
this
making
any
difference
worth
a
try
once
regardless
of
this
beer
not
being
a
favorite
i
appreciate
what
i
have
learned
from
the
work
of
these
brewers
d
not
bad
but
you
wont
find
me
tracking
down
another
interesting
style
that
i
probably
wont
let
get
this
old
again

7
years

beer
sadly
still
good
but
past
its

the

would
have
received
better
marks
for
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
if
you
can
get
a
45
year
old
bottle
you
will
love
it
just
a
little
too
tart
for
me
to
really
get
into

otherwise
it

vintage
1999
a
very
interesting
beer
and
my
first
significantly
aged
one
very
port
like
with
a
strong
showing
of
dark
fruit
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
this
and
it
was
a
great
experience
not
something
i
would
want
everyday
but
something
fun
to
try
not
sure
what
it
would
be
like
fresh
though
drinkability
i
think
depends
on
whether
you
like
the
tangyness
of
this
beer
i
do
like
it
so
i
could
drink
several
more
still
the
high
abv
probably
makes
this
a
a
2
beer
max
kind
of
session
beer
unless
you
want
to
get
pretty
lit
up
hazy
muted
brown
color
no
head
at
all
a
few
tiny
bubbles
scattered
on
edge
of
glass
no
hop
or
malt
aroma
present
prunes
and
plumesdark
fruit
very
evident
in
smell
dark
mustiness
in
smells
as
well
very
earthy
thick
syrupy
texture
mild
carbonation
delightful
fruity
sweetness
dark

again
drink
starts
off
dark
and
sweet
showing
some
of
the
alcohol
content
finishes
light
and
tart
interesting
but
welcome
contrast
between
start
to
finish
tart
and
musty
aftertaste
nice
old
ale
taste
brings
be
back
to
the
olden
days
in
the
old
world
not
that
i
would
really
know
but
i
imagine
something
like
this
beer
would
have
been
there
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
was
telling
scott
that
i
feel
like
i
have
never
had
a
old
ale
until
this
point
because
the
american
versions
tend
to
be
more
like
a
sweet
barlywine
i
am
willing
to
say
that
this
beer
will
hold
up
for
quite
some
time
so
if
you
do
see
some
be
sure
to
get
a
couple
scott
says
as
they
get
older
they
become
more
sour
and
super
complex
coming
from
his
previous
1996
bottle
he
enjoyed
i
want
to
give
a
final
thanks
to
scott
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
having
another
one
sometime
soon
funny
enough
this
is
going
down
ok
a
true
sipper
but
this
is
not
your
novice
beer
it
is
the
most
unbeer
like
thing
ive
had
that
is
not
spoiled
or
turned
for
that
matter
it
so
wants
to
be
wrong
and
there
is
enough
to
redeem
it
not
for
everyone
and
absolutely
not
to
be
the
first
try
of
this
style
solid
4s
very
interesting
and
different
2003
vintage
pours
a
one
finger
cream
head
that
vanishes
without
a
trace
of
lace
murky
brown
color
very
light
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
nose
is
raisins
and
malt
flavor
is
sweet
and
sour
raisins
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
bad
but
needs
more
carbonation
6
99
for
a
corked
275ml
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
d
very
drinkable
enjoyable
old
ale
despite
my
love
for
sours
i
dont
think
id
go
any
older
than
2005
the
flavors
that
develop
are
great
as
is
but
its
already
losing
some
beery
characteristics
in
danger
of
becoming
a
very
weak
brandy
or
something
instead
thick
chewy
with
very
low
carb
goes
down
easily
would
certainly
enjoy
another
bottle
if
available
d
absolutely
love
this
beer
would
be
incredible
from
the
cask
this
is
british
ale
at
its
best
i
wonder
if
its
possible
that
this
beer
has
simply
lost
its
luster
over
time
i
most
certainly
take
the
blame
for
having
inadequate
storage
conditions
i
will
likely
try
a
more
recent
version
to
gain
a
better
idea
of
this
beer
regardless
i
found
it
pleasant
and
enjoyable
if
a
bit
bland
drain
pour
d
not
a
bad
beer
even
with
5
years
on
it
its
just
really
thin
and
perhaps
has
lost
most
of
its
carbonation
during
that
time
i
would
like
to
find
a
fresh
one
to
compare
drinkability
the
smell
is
the
best
part
and
the
mouthfeel
is
the
worst
it
appears
that
this
beer
is
hit
or
miss
with
respect
to
how
it
ages
mine
was
a
miss
future
outlook
pity
that
there
is
no
carbonation
left
in
this
one
i
could
see
really
enjoying
it
immensely
if
it
was
somehow
adequately
carbed
oh
well
still
an
interesting
aged
beer
that
hit
the
mark
in
some
areas
but
fell
short
in
others
drinkability
all
in
all
a
disappointing
beer
i
saw
this
in
a
store
in
ny
and
was
pretty
excited
having
heard
lots
of
good
things
about
it
this
one
is
only
8
years
old
and
certainly
should
not
be
past
its
prime
from
the
taste
it
would
seem
that
it
never
really
had
the
initial
boldness
to
stand
up
to
aging
i
grabbed
a
few
of
these
glad
i
resisted
the
temptation
to
buy
all
of
them
bottle
from
1996
corked
and
poured
into
a
small
snifter
pours
a
ruddy
muddy
hazy
dirty
earthy
brown
color
no
carbonation
at
all
none
wish
i
had
a
reference
point
to
know
if
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
or
at
its
best
tastes
of
dates
figs
raisins
but
not
really
in
the
most
pleasant
way
not
bad
at
all
but
certainly
wouldnt
have
been
worth
the
wait
if
i
had
cellared
this
one
for
14
years
jizztastic
this
may
have
been
delicious
back
when
i
was
in
elementary
school
but
at
this
age
falls
flat
in
every
way
into
a
stemmed
stone
glass
it
poured
a
cloudy
caramel
chestnut
color
with
no
head
and
no
visible
carbonation
smelled
of
molasses
maple
syrup
caramel
blackberry
currant
raisin
and
sour
plum
sweet
start
progresses
to
a
vanillaoaksweetsour
midpalate
and
then
finishes
with
a
big
dark
fruit
alcohol
burn
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
thick
viscous
and
smooth
with
no
carbonation
the
big
alcohol
burn
and
zero
head
detracted
from
what
could
have
been
a
tremendous
sensory
experience
bottled
in
1998
purchased
at
healthy
spirits
cork
was
difficult
to
take
off
few
chunks
of
cork
pour
into
a
dark
murky
copper
hue
smells
of
smooth
liquor
no
head
no
carbonation
tastes
a
little
like
a
dry
red
wine
hints
of
vinegar
you
cannot
really
taste
anything
else
im
hopingguessing
that
this
is
what
hops
taste
like
when
theyre
super
old
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
it
definitely
not
bad
its
just
not
every
day
that
you
get
to
drink
a
12
year
old
bottle
of
beer
especially
for
3
50
im
curious
as
to
who
cellared
it
for
so
long
healthy
spirits
or
the
brewery
taste
is
fruity
with
a
sour
kick
and
a
touch
of
smoke
whiskey
and
wine
notes
with
some
tanninlike
flavors
found
in
dry
red
wines
mild
oxidation
not
much
seems
like
something
that
could
be
aged
for
quite
a
long
while
will
surely
pick
of
a
few
next
time
i
see
it
for
the
cellar
vinous
like
a
rodenbach
meets
hibernation
full
mouthfeel
creamy
and
more
carbonated
than
most
old
ales
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
outstandingly
delicious
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
a
prize
old
ale
thats
13
years
old
overall
its
pretty
impressive
and
is
good
it
really
does
have
a
strong
old
ale
character
i
love
that
about
it
but
it
really
needs
some
bubbles
and
more
body
those
two
things
would
really
open
up
some
of
the
finer
qualities
of
this
beer
nonetheless
im
really
enjoying
the
bottle
sans
bubbles
after
13
years
its
tasting
pretty
damn
good
thanks
a
ton
chris
much
more
drinkable
than
some
of
the
headier
old
ales
around
and
still
good
quality
after
seven
years
drinkability
is
insanely
good
this
really
epitomizes
the
beauty
of
aged
english
ales
huge
complex
flavor
yet
tasty
and
enjoyable
it
stimulates
both
sides
of
the
brain
equally
well
and
makes
me
sad
they
dont
still
make
it
afaik
which
is
why
i
couldnt
score
it
a
5
drinkability
awful
due
to
the
taste
cant
drink
this
cant
believe
i
paid
what
i
did
for
it
notes
this
was
one
of
two
old
ale
style
beers
i
have
tried
so
its
hard
to
judge
it
compared
to
others
but
i
will
say
that
i
did
enjoy
it
it
had
a
nice
complexity
and
warmth
each
sip
seems
to
add
a
new
layer
of
fruity
notes
which
made
it
fun
to
rate
and
slowly
saver
the
cork
was
super
hard
to
get
out
too
poured
out
of
bottle
5044
vintage
1996
this
beer
was
a
very
dark
maroon
color
there
was
very
little
carbonation
and
what
head
remained
quickly
fizzed
away
to
nothing
a
little
disappointing
but
considering
its
may
3rd
2010
today
and
this
beer
is
now
14
years
old
i
cant
say
im
surprised
the
aroma
was
a
pungent
blend
of
brown
sugar
molasses
alcohol
alcohol
infused
fruit
spices
and
caramel
reminiscent
of
a
port
the
flavors
were
also
very
port
like
and
super
complex
dare
i
say
it
too
complex
ok
lets
do
this
raisins
plums
figs
brown
sugar
caramel
a
sourness
akin
to
limes
or
lemon
zest
alcohol
wood
and
dried
apricots
dominated
by
sweet
malts
but
lacking
in
enough
hops
to
balance
it
a
monster
of
an
ale
as
i
came
to
the
end
of
the
my
glass
the
dark
fruit
really
came
through
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
syrupy
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
body
mediumfull
a
unique
experience
but
intense
very
much
too
much
like
drinking
a
sherry
or
a
port
not
what
i
want
when
im
drinking
a
beer
and
it
did
lose
some
points
from
me
because
i
couldnt
describe
it
as
either
refreshing
or
approachable
sadly
one
of
the
least
drinkable
beers
ive
tried
i
fear
what
my
stomach
will
have
to
say
about
it
tomorrow
supposedly
at
its
best
at
20
years
old
if
this
ale
needs
anything
it
isnt
more
age
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
creamy
head
that
quickly
goes
into
a
thin
film
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
of
caramel
apple
dominates
tart
apple
taste
with
a
toffee
sweet
finish
this
was
an
odd
brew
to
drink
not
at
all
what
i
expected
hides
its
alcohol
level
very
well
i
had
a
vintage
2007
there
was
no
carbonation
or
head
whatsoever
beer
was
extremely
sweet
but
also
sour
and
vinegary
smells
like
boozy
molasses
with
no
hop
aromas
at
all
drinkability
suffers
greatly
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
terms
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
its
very
much
like
drinking
a
coke
that
you
left
sitting
out
on
the
counter
a
week
ago
overall
drinkability
3
5
complex
and
enjoyable
but
would
be
better
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
cleaner
appearance
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
boozy
and
sweet
neat
character
but
way
too
sweet
for
me
leaves
a
bit
of
an
acidic
taste
in
your
mouth
the
mild
carbonation
and
the
strong
acidic
and
alcoholic
notes
make
it
not
unlike
wine
its
not
something
youd
want
to
drink
when
youre
thirsty
as
it
is
quite
thick
and
hard
to
get
down
but
it
is
very
warming
and
tastes
delicious
an
excellent
brew
from
george
gale
and
now
with
the
merger
with
fullers
hopefully
this
brew
will
be
easier
to
get
i
had
to
go
to
the
fullers
brewery
shop
to
get
it
interesting
beer
i
might
like
to
try
one
that
wasnt
14
years
old
and
maybe
it
wouldnt
be
flat
not
worth
the
11
i
paid
for
it
but
its
certainly
an
interesting
beer
plus
its
always
very
cool
to
try
something
this
old
d
pretty
easy
to
get
down
i
kind
of
like
the
taste
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
seek
this
out
in
any
way
a
unique
and
constantly
evolving
beer
to
be
sure
solid
dark
fruit
character
like
raisins
and
sour
cherries
its
vinous
and
portlike
at
times
definitely
maltforward
but
quite
dry
as
the
brettanomyces
continues
to
work
slowly
in
the
bottle
some
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
young
bottles
but
its
masked
by
a
tartness
like
sour
granny
smith
apples
and
underripe
pineapple
with
a
couple
years
of
age
hops
all
but
disappear
with
a
little
aging
but
the
malt
and
rogue
yeast
make
up
for
their
absence
an
excellent
candidate
for
cellaring
and
vertical
tastings
a
four
year
old
bottle
stored
in
a
less
than
ideal
setting
shows
a
huge
bretty
pineapple
profile
along
with
some
light
acid
development
but
the
structure
and
depth
of
dark
fruitiness
is
still
spot
on
with
no
sign
of
oxidation
begins
drinking
more
like
an
oud
bruin
at
3
years
my
appreciation
for
this
beer
is
even
higher
than
my
score
indicates
d
a
very
nice
old
alesurprised
i
made
it
this
long
with
out
picking
it
up
to
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
dark
red
color
body
small
whitish
head
quickly
diminishing
english
smelling
brown
sugar
a
little
alcohol
very
floral
and
sweet
smelling
grape
juice
slick
taste
somewhat
musty
some
roastiness
odd
somewhat
sour
fruity
funky
almost
like
sour
grapes
interesting
i
like
it
overall
this
tasted
like
it
had
potential
back
in
the
day
but
had
been
kept
for
too
long
would
like
to
give
a
more
recent
vintage
a
chance
if
that
is
possible
this
was
bottled
in
1996
7303
it
is
not
what
i
would
want
from
a
13
year
old
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
wonderful
example
of
a
traditional
english
strong
ale
aged
to
near
perfection
this
is
it
this
is
the
perfect
swan
song
for
a
once
great
brewery
knocked
me
on
my
face
when
i
took
this
12
year
old
monster
beers
are
clearly
not
meant
to
age
this
long
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
just
for
the
fact
it
could
age
so
long
but
whoo
its
strong
very
warming
honestly
i
just
couldnt
do
it
yay
for
pouring
a
5
down
the
drain
there
is
truly
a
deep
intrigue
in
this
beer
because
of
its
unique
aged
quality
it
pour
a
murky
mahogany
without
any
head
really
the
look
of
a
stale
oud
bruin
nose
is
that
exactly
an
intense
tart
basamic
vinegar
port
quality
a
bit
of
fig
grape
flanders
red
fashion
the
missing
link
between
english
old
ale
and
flanders
this
old
ale
either
default
of
aging
properties
or
poor
storage
after
having
numerous
times
ive
found
as
what
appears
to
be
quite
live
it
doesnt
keep
that
well
past
recommended
date
not
for
ageing
look
of
mild
cloudy
mahogany
palate
is
cherry
tart
chalk
rosemary
with
a
finish
of
tobacco
and
grape
in
a
great
bottle
you
get
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
there
are
quintessential
old
ale
style
properties
a
nice
caramel
backbone
but
there
is
very
much
so
a
sour
one
could
say
wild
influence
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
surprise
but
i
can
see
how
this
would
really
deter
a
lot
of
drinkers
d
awesome
refined
and
complex
full
flavored
old
ale
that
taste
like
a
belgian
lambic
flemish
wild
brown
ale
nicely
hides
9
abv
this
batch
of
brews
has
been
respected
i
bought
this
on
the
cheap
like
just
about
everyone
else
apparently
not
expecting
much
but
definitely
interested
in
a
13
year
old
brew
i
expected
no
carbonation
and
some
heavy
oxidation
i
got
them
both
the
oxidation
turned
this
into
a
sour
cardboard
mess
there
were
some
port
and
sherry
notes
in
the
nose
but
nothing
redeeming
enough
to
keep
this
from
the
lips
of
the
mighty
drain
great
example
of
an
authentic
old
ale
at
ten
years
this
was
quite
nice
but
im
sure
it
will
continue
to
get
better
for
another
decade
2005
vintage
purchased
103009
this
beer
was
completely
flat
and
was
very
murky
looked
like
prune
juice
i
guess
you
could
call
it
portlike
but
it
was
so
oxidized
it
was
undrinkable
i
set
it
down
and
came
back
to
to
it
i
tried
it
again
and
poured
it
down
the
drain
i
guess
thats
what
i
get
for
buying
a
vintage
ale
for

like
overripe
red
grapes
taste
was
the
only
really
redeeming
quality
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
spanish
brandy
that
i
once
enjoyed
fruity
and
mellow
flavors
very
gentle
on
the
palate
with
some
age
the
alcohol
must
have
been
smoothed
way
out
as
there
was
no
way
that
you
could
tell
this
was
a
9
beer
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
while
you
ponder
the
style
but
i
am
not
overly
thrilled
not
entirely
sure
this
beer
is
prizeworthy
in
my
book
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
ye
old
fruity
elixir
the
hallmarks
of
age
are
here
but
compliment
rather
than
strike
against
it
musty
oxidation
and
pruney
raisin
fig
sweetness
no
hint
at
a
high
abv
imagine
a
mixed
fruit
flavored
fruit
roll
up
aged
for
a
few
years
in
a
cellar
then
distilled
into
an
old
ale
light
yet
slightly
syrupy
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
sweet
after
dinner
drink
d
fascinating
to
see
the
effects
of
age
a
fun
sipper
with
a
sexy
allure
warmth
is
subtle
flavor
is
layered
aroma
nears
the
sublime
wouldnt
shy
away
from
this
again
a
relative
bargain
in
the
4
range
and
may
pick
up
a
couple
more
to
see
what
some
added
years
can
do
worth
a
try
definitely
2002
vintage
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
honey
wheat
and
brown
sugar
with
some
prune
and
raisin
and
sour
cherry
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
tasted
like
sour
cherry
and
brown
sugar
with
earthy
toffee
and
a
bit
of
musty
raisin
and
plastic
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
had
great
scent
and
a
nicely
aged
taste
i
tried
a
gales
before
that
was
oxidized
so
this
was
much
better
it
was
surprisingly
carbonated
but
also
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
it
was
also
more
sour
than
expected
but
it
still
hid
the
alcohol
pretty
well
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
but
it
still
wasnt
my
favorite
old
ale
by
any
means
be
careful
when
pulling
the
cork
it
might
break
apart
to
a
crumbly
mess
when
removing
it
vinous
on
the
palate
with
a
wallop
of
prunes
figs
and
light
soy
sauce
toffee
sweetness
meets
wood
earth
tobacco
and
leather
the
body
seems
to
have
thinned
quite
a
bit
from
age
and
the
stillness
amplifies
that
13
years
is
a
long
time
for
a
9
beer
but
all
things
considered
this
has
held
up
pretty
nicely
while
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
it
makes
for
an
interesting
sipper
drinkability
for
me
would
be
low
simply
because
it
is
too
complex
not
exactly
refreshing
and
more
worthy
of
the
occasional
special
beer
amber
in
color
with
very
little
carbonation
and
aromas
of
raisins
vinegar
and
fruitcake
taste
is
med
body
smoke
light
bitterness
raisins
sour
cherry
mineral
apple
and
a
light
dry
finish
looking
forward
to
trying
some
older
vintages
in
the
years
to
come
recommended
d
moderate
glad
i
got
this
might
grab
a
couple
more
and
see
what
more
than
4
years
does
to
this
worth
the
price
of
admission
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
whirl
a
respectable
old
ale
it
took
me
close
to
an
hour
to
finish

2005
vintage
comes
in
an
interesting
9
3
oz
bottle
and
after
i
get
off
the
cap
surprise
i
need
to
go
find
my
corkscrew
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
mini
snifter
beer
is
a
deep
amber
brown
with
no
head
just
some
bubbles
on
top
from
the
pour
as
i
swirl
the
beer
around
the
snifter
it
leaves
small
dots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
complex
a
mix
of
fruity
spicy
earthy
and
oaky
tones
black
licorice
or
anise
also
comes
to
mind
the
taste
falls
a
little
short
for
me
while
sharing
some
of
the
complexities
of
the
nose
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
watered
down
whiskey
and
is
also
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
and
dead
on
carbonation
there
is
also
a
drying
acrid
presence
drinkability
of
this
one
is
lowered
by
the
fact
that
i
dont
really
enjoy
this
old
ale
i
was
really
excited
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
i
feel
let
down
it
starts
to
grow
on
me
though
as
it
warms
up
and
my
tounge
gets
numb
from
the
alcohol
too
much
tannin
for
my
taste
but
still
a
good
beer
very
unique
this
is
a
beer
for
someone
who
likes
cabernet
d
a
contemplative
beverage
that
will
work
as
a
nightcap
or
an
aperitif
or
if
you
see
one
pick
it
up
and
then
haul
it
out
at
a
tasting
as
a
curiosity
im
kinda
wanting
to
pair
this
with
a
plum
pudding
or
a
bread
pudding
as
well
frankly
this
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
lighter
version
of
the
le
coq
imperial
stout
a
sipper
i
bought
a
bottle
of
the
2007
vintage
on
a
trip
to
england
last
year
im
about
to
return
so
i
thought
i
would
crack
this
open
and
see
if
it
was
worth
getting
any
more
first
impressions
surprise
at
the
tartness
of
it
i
was
expecting
something
entirely
different
but
this
should
almost
be
categorized
as
a
sour
as
i
drank
it
it
started
to
grow
on
me
but
i
was
still
confused
by
the
description
made
it
sound
like
the
greatest
thing
since
sliced
bread
in
my
experience
in
england
if
you
went
into
a
pub
and
they
poured
you
something
this
sour
they
would
assume
the
keg
had
gone
off
and
would
have
promptly
dumped
your
pint
and
given
you
another
so
as
a
sour
i
think
its
fine
will
i
buy
some
more
no
i
scored
it
with
a
middling
level
of
confusion
over
the
beer
type
if
it
were
categorized
as
a
sour
i
would
score
it
higher
interesting
flavor
but
i
cant
say
that
im
much
of
a
fan
prize
old
ale
starts
off
with
a
spicy
almost
sour
booziness
amplified
by
overpowering
carbonation
for
the
style
at
least
quickly
coats
the
palate
with
browned
apple
flesh
tart
cherries
and
toffee
before
giving
way
to
a
finish
of
ethanol
and
vinegar
a
little
improvement
as
the
beer
warms
but
not
much
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
watery
for
an
old
ale
and
the
increased
bubbliness
and
dry
finish
work
against
the
drinkability
not
impressed
its
palatable
but
i
considered
drainpouring
this
beer
a
few
times
overall
impression
its
a
little
too
peculiar
and
not
quite
entertaining
enough
to
be
really
good
but
rather
its
different
and
interesting
its
more
caustic
than
many
tripelsbspas
ive
had
and
yet
still
seems
to
maintain
a
cool
laidback
english
demeanor
a
beer
only
a
beerlover
could
enjoy
i
enjoyed
it
and
im
really
glad
i
stumbled
upon
it
for
a
chance
to
try
it
but
im
not
itching
for
another
the
beer
grows
on
me
and
the
mild
carbonation
helps
i
find
that
the
subtle
flavors
there
are
not
distracted
by
the
body
which
happens
to
be
medium
and
chewy
the
beer
starts
a
little
shaky
but
finishes
well
and
the
9
gives
you
a
nice
warm
kick
to
the
gut
brewed
to
age
this
beer
probably
constantly
changes
in
flavor
i
look
forward
to
finding
another
few
bottles
and
trying
it
earlier
and
later
have
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
2005
for
quite
a
while
and
wish
i
would
have
tried
it
sooner
poured
into
snifter
at
cellar
temp
producing
no
head
whatsoever
after
an
aggressive
pour
smell
was
actually
quite
sour
on
the
nose
light
bits
of
fruity
raisin
and
some
malt
but
i
focused
more
on
the
sourness
taste
was
quite
different
with
pleasing
smoothness
raisin
again
full
malt
and
nothing
of
alcohol
or
sour
vinegar
that
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
this
was
a
fine
drink
for
me
sip
and
enjoy
sip
and
enjoy
i
kept
going
back
to
smelling
this
drink
and
then
taking
a
nice
pull
with
a
good
chewy
mouthfeel
and
though
9
abv
id
say
i
could
have
another
so
drinkability
is
quite
good
ive
got
two
more
bottles
of
this
and
it
will
take
some
restraint
not
to
crack
them
open
pours
a
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
a
hint
of
ripe
cherries
malt
and
a
whiff
of
vinegar
taste
is
surprisingly
tart
sweet
with
a
malty
base
you
can
still
taste
the
hops
as
well
quite
unusual
but
good
taste
mouthfeel
is
rich
nice
low
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
as
high
from
the
tartness
and
alcohol
content
but
overall
i
really
like
this
it
doesnt
taste
like
other
old
ales
ive
had
but
still
good
i
will
get
this
again
pours
the
color
of
coca
cola
in
a
pint
glass
almost
flat
looking
i
smelled
raisins
some
maple
syrup
and
some
vinegar
maple
syrup
molasses
and
lots
of
vinegar
in
the
taste
some
raisins
creeps
in
as
well
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
and
acidity
quite
easy
to
drink
will
try
again
for
sure
overall
im
always
happy
to
try
aged
beers
this
one
is
13
years
old
its
not
the
oldest
ive
had
nor
the
best
but
definitely
not
the
worst
not
rushing
out
to
buy
up
any
more
of
it
but
glad
i
tried
one
bottle
frankly
i
think
this
beer
is
probably
best
within
3
to
5
years
of
bottling
it
is
okay
older
but
not
competitive
with
thomas
hardys
ale
or
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
a
2007
bottle
that
is
still
very
alcoholic
not
bad
at
all
just
not
to
my
liking
for
the
style
though
this
might
be
closer
to
style
than
some
of
my
favorites
ola
dubh
and
fullers
vintage
ale
take
that
into
consideration
recalls
a
good
quality
sherry
and
a
tawny
port
certainly
unique
not
sure
id
be
up
for
another
bottle
right
now
but
would
certainly
welcome
another
down
the
road
definitely
an
intersting
experience
and
definitely
worth
trying
this
was
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
it
would
seem
this
was
stored
well
and
the
negative
aging
notes
are
mostly
absent
from
this
bottle
nice
still
though
not
as
complex
as
an
old
harvest
ale
or
thomas
hardys
drinkability
enjoyable
and
pleasantly
drinkable
but
when
reaching
for
an
englishborn
beer
from
the
1990s
i
far
prefer
to
grab
ahold
of
the
j
w
lees
harvest
ales
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
smooth
drinker
that
packs
a
nice
punch
it
would
be
a
nice
change
if
the
spiciness
of
belgian
dark
strongs
is
getting
too
familiar
for
you
d
really
tasty
interesting
brew
after
13
years
i
didnt
know
how
well
it
would
hold
up
but
it
certainly
did
it
well
a
classic
english
strong
ale
a
must
try
2007
vintage
a
thin
sheet
of
tan
head
fades
quickly
atop
a
dark
ruby
brew
no
lacing
to
speak
of
is
left
behind
although
there
are
a
few
bubbles
left
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
aroma
is
strong
and
vinous
with
the
alcohol
peeking
its
head
out
among
some
grapes
and
figs
taste
is
also
strong
and
cloying
at
first
after
that
some
sweet
malts
come
through
along
with
some
more
dark
fruits
grain
alcohol
and
a
note
of
bitterness
to
finish
things
off
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
and
theres
very
little
carbonation
present
as
evidenced
by
the
aforementioned
lack
of
head
this
is
not
a
terribly
bad
beer
but
it
never
quite
escapes
the
initial
imbalance
that
is
felt
on
the
palate
and
with
so
many
good
old
ales
on
the
market
i
cant
see
returning
to
this
one
conclusion
i
gave
this
an
a
first
time
around
this
id
probably
give
a
strong
b
overall
i
think
ill
bump
the
overall
score
down
to
a
b
to
take
both
samples
into
account
i
just
popped
open
a
1995
vintage
bottle1021
the
cork
crumbled
when
i
tried
to
pull
it
out
fished
out
most
of
it
like
an
idiot
i
did
not
keep
it
on
its
side
oh
well
that
saidthis
ale
is
not
too
bad
for
its
age
it
has
a
muddy
brown
color
and
a
raisinlike
flavor
it
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
after
taste
too
not
much
alcohol
notes
either
the
beer
had
almost
no
head
although
this
may
have
to
do
with
its
age
just
a
few
bubbles
that
dissipated
quickly
i
think
i
let
this
one
age
too
long
a
younger
bottle
may
be
better
still
not
as
bad
as
it
could
have
been
notes
seems
to
be
a
little
sweeter
than
the
average
slightly
more
sour
old
ales
but
maybe
i
need
a
greater
sample
size
overall
a
wonderfully
unique
beer
d
an
ok
mouthfeel
overall
but
the
taste
could
use
a
little
work
the
alcohol
could
have
been
reduced
or
more
malts
could
have
been
used
to
smooth
out
the
taste
overall
overall
ah
well
i
liked
it
but
this
beer
is
right
now
a
bit
too
sour
should
be
better
after
a
couple
of
years
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
me
to
really
jump
for
joy
with
this
strange
wellaged
brew
i
was
intrigued
with
this
one
from
the
start
and
enjoyed
looking
for
the
nuance
in
every
sip
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
a
favorite
beer
to
drink
d
i
suspect
anyone
who
was
in
the
mood
for
dark
red
wine
might
appreciate
this
or
someone
who
really
enjoys
this
sort
of
beer
oddity
might
enjoy
but
for
others
it
is
probably
merely
a
curiosity
and
best
sampled
with
a
small
group
of
friends
who
only
wish
for
about
2
us
ounces
i
poured
this
into
a
nonik
glass
its
a
lovely
deep
copper
color
with
a
small
head
on
top
the
nose
is
sweet
fruity
with
a
little
bit
of
vinegary
iron
underneath
very
nice
flavor
a
true
old
ale
taste
here
a
strong
winey
almostbutnotquite
vinegary
sourness
with
an
oaky
brandylike
edge
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
malt
which
while
not
adding
much
sweetness
provides
a
silky
caramel
addition
a
little
cherryraisin
fruitiness
comes
through
at
the
end
the
body
is
a
tad
thin
but
i
assume
thats
mostly
because
of
the
lactic
fermentation
very
nice
overall
if
you
like
sour
beers
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
this
beer
feels
maybe
a
bit
unbalanced
with
the
sweetness
it
almost
get
a
bit
too
much
though
a
actually
appreciated
the
sourness
in
this
beer
alcohol
is
well
integrated
in
the
taste
it
has
a
nice
warming
feel
not
sure
how
old
my
bottle
was
there
was
absolutely
no
head
and
slight
oxidation
on
the
nose
but
neither
fact
bothered
me
a
lot
the
aroma
surprisingly
evoked
a
lot
of
belgian
floral
qualities
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
somewhat
tart
raisins
cherries
apple
maybe
even
some
raspberry
notes
plus
a
certain
ale
mustiness
that
i
find
appealing
finishes
like
it
starts
a
very
good
old
ale
which
i
would
recommend
though
im
sure
its
not
for
everyone
not
even
every
beer
geek
it
shows
off
the
somewhat
boozy
dark
fruitiness
well
with
characteristics
of
red
wine
an
interesting
sipper
with
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
flat
very
dark
copper
has
a
sappy
or
syrupy
sweetness
and
full
body
filled
with
a
cornucopia
of
fruit
deep
dark
juicy
cranberryraisinplumcurrantfig
has
the
classic
vinous
barleywine
character
but
then
there
is
the
significant
malt
backbone
too
and
the
alcohol
no
hops
bitterness
flavor
or
aroma
its
perfectly
drinkable
as
far
as
im
concerned
how
do
you
rate
a
beer
like
this
it
is
obviously
a
milestone
in
craft
brewing
and
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
its
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
not
that
of
a
typical
beer
i
could
develop
a
taste
for
it
on
the
right
occasions
in
fact
now
that
i
have
adjusted
to
it
i
could
have
another
best
for
dessert
or
a
long
evening
enjoying
a
cigar
or
some
alternative
smoke
but
i
would
never
serve
it
to
anyone
expecting
a
normal
beer
d
this
is
not
my
cup
of
ale
very
much
a
sipper
bottle
like
a
nice
dessert
wine
would
be
excellent
with
a
nice
bleu
cheese
well
this
was
a
really
exciting
beer
hopefully
some
storing
will
make
this
one
a
real
beauty
drinks
slooow
a
great
night
cap
but
not
one
to
dive
in
to
blightlty
a
great
dessert
or
cheese
course
selection
this
would
be
nice
one
to
split
new
years
eve
1999
vintage
275ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
bronze
color
the
aroma
is
very
good
with
a
lot
of
dark
fruity
malt
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
is
sweet
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
spices
caramel
and
a
portlike
alcohol
finish
i
am
very
impressed
at
how
well
this
beer
has
held
up
after
9
years
overall
this
really
was
a
really
interesting
beer
to
try
especially
considering
how
old
the
sampling
was
recommended
drinkability
not
an
everyday
kind
of
beer
drinks
more
like
a
wine
definitely
a
sipper
worth
a
try
2003
vintage
tasted
on
52008
gales
old
prize
2007
is
a
strange
beer
but
ina
good
way
in
that
it
has
a
sherry
like
flavour
and
basically
no
carbination
but
you
wouldnt
think
its
a
ale
at
9
and
its
an
almost
a
syrupy
consistancey
and
is
vey
sweet
and
slightly
malty
with
no
trace
of
hops
and
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
but
is
worth
a
try
just
for
the
experiance
a
nutty
vanilla
taste
seems
like
it
wants
to
develop
but
never
does
seems
like
its
kept
in
check
by
the
sourness
sherrylike
taste
really
grows
on
me
becomes
more
sour
as
it
warms
afterthoughts
poured
in
the
sediment
for
the
last
third
of
the
bottle
while
it
did
pull
the
edges
off
the
alcohol
and
add
some
more
tartness
it
also
muddied
up
the
other
finer
details
of
its
taste
and
nose
note
to
self
old
ales
sediment
is
meant
to
be
left
behind
well
it
was
an
experience
seriously
though
this
tasted
just
like
port
wine
in
a
blind
tasting
there
is
no
way
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
beer
not
in
a
million
years
im
not
too
familiar
with
aged
beers
the
oldest
id
had
up
to
this
point
was
6
or
7
years
but
this
was
different
than
anything
id
had
before
i
enjoyed
trying
this
one
but
i
doubt
id
get
it
again
if
you
like
port
id
say
go
for
it
if
not
you
might
want
to
stay
away
the
taste
is
very
winey
slightly
musty
with
a
very
faint
sourness
and
a
faint
whisky
and
rum
quality
but
despite
the
clear
alcoholic
character
its
still
smooth
and
drinkable
its
mostly
sweet
spicey
and
warmly
alcoholic
with
little
bitterness
and
as
mentioned
only
a
slight
sourness
that
has
a
light
vinegary
quality
but
this
is
very
slight
it
has
overripe
apples
prunes
and
caramel
the
feel
is
very
silky
drinkable
i
split
the
bottle
and
had
had
enough
i
probably
could
have
done
the
whole
thing
but
at
the
price
it
brings
at
the
store
im
not
going
to
find
out
anytime
soon
had
with
two
mates
the
three
of
us
together
couldnt
finish
the
one
bottle
and
poured
it
out
gales
prize
old
ale
brewed
in
2005
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
ring
of
off
white
head
from
a
brown
275
ml
corked
bottle
the
aroma
is
vinous
ripe
fruit
at
that
the
flavor
is
very
fruity
yet
dry
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
candied
fruit
is
what
comes
to
mind
but
not
especially
sweet
the
mouthfeel
strikes
me
as
just
a
bit
thin
kind
of
an
odd
beer
worth
a
try
2005
version
pours
a
murky
brown
that
delivers
absolutely
zero
head
nose
seems
a
bit
spicy
really
there
is
an
interesting
fruit
aspect
here
i
want
to
say
it
is
banana
or
plantain
not
entirely
sure
pretty
smooth
on
the
mouth
nice
to
drink
and
an
unusual
treat
drinkability
not
something
i
would
revisit
an
ok
beer
but
not
impressive
i
only
hope
i
can
wait
to
try
the
2001
it
will
be
amazing
to
see
what
it
is
like
with
10
years
on
it
d
beer
appears
to
have
aged
nicely
and
a
very
decent
brew
with
a
decent
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
old
ale
id
say
this
might
be
the
youngest
vintage
id
want
to
try
as
it
still
seems
a
little
raw
still
tasty
stuff
poured
into
a
chalice
a
brownish
color
not
much
carbonation
basically
no
head
or
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
tarttangy
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
tarttangy
very
light
sweetness
and
some
caramel
tones
the
alcohol
is
pretty
up
front
but
not
too
bad
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
different
old
ale
because
of
the
tartness
to
me
might
be
the
age
not
sure
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
eric
drinkability
this
beer
may
require
an
acquired
taste
i
would
guess
even
for
more
experienced
imbibers
seems
to
be
true
to
the
style
but
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
one
unfortunately
for
anyone
whos
reading
this
review
and
planning
on
buying
some
to
drink
tonight
i
have
no
idea
what
its
like
fresh
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
well
balanced
for
a
good
nightcap
but
also
would
be
a
great
accompanyment
to
a
rich
meal
drain
pour
it
pours
a
medium
nut
brown
with
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
i
even
poured
it
forcefully
to
force
one
to
form
but
to
no
avail
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
think
prunes
or
figs
bitter
malts
and
leather
i
found
the
flavor
to
consist
mainly
of
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
and
leather
with
some
vanilla
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
isnt
very
exciting
i
must
admit
ive
tried
just
a
few
versions
of
the
old
ale
style
since
the
first
incredible
version
i
sampled
and
this
may
the
most
unpalatable
of
all
its
not
really
bad
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
interesting
going
on
my
wife
described
the
flavor
as
flat
molasses
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
no
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brown
brew
some
bubbling
around
the
rim
but
no
lace
present
more
or
less
as
expected
from
such
an
aged
old
ale
aroma
is
leathery
sweet
dark
malts
rounding
the
corners
of
the
ample
alcohol
presence
taste
kicks
off
with
a
watery
dark
maltiness
with
sharpened
edges
of
tartness
gets
leathery
and
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
both
of
which
slowly
usher
in
the
boozy
warm
close
mouthfeel
was
oddly
thin
upfront
for
such
a
heavy
brew
but
the
alcohol
was
smoothed
amazingly
drinkability
was
pretty
good
for
such
an
aged
and
interesting
brew
i
would
definitely
enjoy
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
one
of
the
few
beers
i
have
failed
to
finish
got
this
one
at
monks
in
a
little
tiny
bottle
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
seriously
none
nose
is
lots
of
prunes
some
honey
taste
is
similar
strong
sweet
fruity
malt
and
honey
mostly
feel
is
strange
theres
very
little
carbonation
to
this
one
and
i
wasnt
really
sure
why
a
little
more
carbonation
would
have
added
a
bit
to
the
drinkability
overall
it
was
alright
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
different
and
interesting
just
not
fantastic
maybe
i
should
try
another
vintage
but
i
am
not
seeking
this
out
any
time
soon
the
flavor
is
very
rich
and
full
of
depth
malt
is
up
front
caramel
raisins
little
wood
there
is
a
twang
of
sour
but
it
is
not
that
strong
and
kinda
cuts
the
full
body
of
the
ale
overall
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
i
would
like
to
compare
a
newer
version
to
the
96
definitely
one
of
the
more
odd
beers
ive
ever
tasted
and
tied
with
the
oldest
this
may
be
a
little
past
its
prime
but
it
has
held
up
amazingly
well
for
11
years
no
signs
of
oxidation
and
it
still
has
a
surprisingly
high
level
of
carbonation
for
only
being
sealed
with
a
cork
worth
picking
up
and
trying
it
but
i
think
11
years
may
be
a
bit
too
far
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
overall
this
was
an
awesome
gem
a
friend
was
willing
to
share
although
they
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
an
8
year
old
brew
it
held
up
very
very
well
and
the
flavor
profile
was
intensely
different
and
smooth
than
any
young
beer
i
could
ever
have
so
do
i
like
it
no
not
really
but
i
can
say
that
im
glad
i
tried
it
even
more
so
im
glad
it
was
on
sale
not
really
recommend
unless
youre
looking
to
experiment
d
this
is
such
a
sipper
i
cant
figure
out
what
the
deal
is
with
this
it
is
so
unique
and
interesting
but
it
i
just
cant
get
into
it
it
is
10
years
old
and
i
guess
i
am
glad
i
didnt
save
it
for
a
big
event
i
would
have
been
disappointed
worth
a
try
though
just
for
the
fact
that
i
was
in
middle
school
when
this
was
bottled
pours
a
very
murky
brown
with
absolutely
no
head
at
all
not
a
pretty
beer
the
smell
is
of
raisins
and
spice
with
a
touch
of
soy
on
the
backnote
a
veritable
fruitcake
of
aromas
with
a
rummy
alcohol
and
candies
fruits
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
subdued
but
with
some
of
the
same
elements
that
were
in
the
aroma
notes
of
brandied
fruit
soy
raisins
and
a
little
bit
of
toffee
im
not
enamored
of
the
mouthfeel
absolutely
no
carbonation
and
too
thin
in
the
body
makes
this
a
little
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
ive
always
found
this
beer
hit
or
miss
it
can
be
wonderful
but
when
its
completely
flat
and
faded
tasting
like
this
its
just
a
novelty
d
perhaps
not
worth
the
8
that
i
paid
for
it
at
the
bar
and
definitely
not
as
good
as
th
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
maybe
i
am
just
not
in
the
mood
for
this
one
but
i
was
very
dissaitsfied
very
sour
and
old
tasting
possibly
it
needs
more
aging
or
maybe
just
to
be
dumped
not
pleased
2003
vintage
dark
with
no
head
and
very
low
carbonation
strong
treacle
and
mollassas
notes
with
dried
apple
aromas
thick
syrupy
palate
with
insufficient
hops
or
carbonation
to
keep
from
coating
the
tongue
perhaps
the
overly
malty
character
will
attenuate
with
time
drinkablity
well
i
didnt
finish
it
d
overall
not
worth
retaining
for
a
long
haul
interesting
to
put
the
retroglasses
on
for
a
view
of
beers
to
hold
from
ten
years
back
though
a
very
enjoyable
vintage
old
ale
that
has
aged
well
although
not
quite
gracefully
i
was
really
excited
to
find
this
bottle
at
the
store
i
was
however
a
little
dissapointed
in
the
beers
lack
of
drinkability
it
pours
a
dark
nut
brown
color
with
no
head
only
a
thin
little
lace
with
good
retention
it
smelled
of
dried
fruit
alcohol
wine
grapes
and
roasted
malts
it
tasted
again
like
dried
fruit
alcohol
wine
malty
with
almost
no
hop
character
at
all
it
was
oily
and
smooth
like
wine
but
had
a
rather
bitter
alcoholic
finish
pours
flat
with
a
color
and
consistency
that
reminds
me
of
melted
caramel
mixed
with
coffee
aromas
of
coffee
grounds
molasses
and
hints
of
winebarrel
on
the
tongue
chocolates
and
coffee
first
off
leading
to
fruity
sweetness
apricots
figs
and
hot
alcohol
some
nuttiness
in
the
finish
and
a
touch
of
winey
sourness
strange
twopart
mouthfeel
with
creaminess
at
first
followed
by
wateryness
toward
the
back
overall
a
very
good
old
ale
true
to
the
english
style
thomas
hardys
less
fruity
more
chocolatey
cousin
d
this
beer
has
a
very
bland
taste
and
has
lost
much
of
its
character
recently
drank
a
pint
of
the
05
vintage
hand
drawn
from
cask
at
rich
os
louisville
expecting
a
lot
from
this
brew
it
didnt
give
me
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
different
the
cask
gave
an
almost
flat
look
to
the
beer
with
lessened
carbonation
and
virtually
no
carbonation
a
dark
brown
brew
with
amber
highlights
smells
much
older
than
and
05
with
a
very
woodsy
musky
nutty
almostmoldy
aroma
flavors
supported
the
aromas
but
added
caramel
malts
dark
fruits
figs
and
dates
and
a
strong
fusal
alcohol
flavor
the
feel
was
heavy
on
the
palate
with
a
mildly
oily
texture
lack
of
carbonation
made
the
beer
seem
heavier
than
it
was
the
finish
was
a
lingering
maltiness
and
alcohol
sensation
strange
but
good
training
for
the
taste
buds
drinkability
pretty
good
drinkability
for
a
9
abv
old
ale
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
the
complexity
does
limit
drinkability
somewhat
next
time
if
i
want
a
sherry
ill
order
it
gimme
a
bells
or
a
northcoast
anyday
fuck
i
get
so
pissed
i
keep
seeing
decent
to
good
reviews
from
this
brewere
and
i
keep
buying
into
it
keep
spending
money
on
it
and
cant
understand
what
is
going
wrong
the
beer
is
far
from
spoiled
it
just
tastes
like
some
boring
crap
im
vowing
to
wait
till
im
in
their
homeland
to
try
this
brewery
again
banned
mouthfeel
pretty
tart
maybe
aging
for
about
three
years
didnt
subdue
its
tart
flavor
or
maybe
it
wasnt
stored
properly
either
way
this
beer
hit
the
sides
of
the
tongue
the
most
with
its
cranberry
like
tart
the
middle
is
wear
prepennicilin
hit
the
most
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
at
first
but
when
evaluated
as
a
slowdrinking
sweet
dessert
beer
well
it
gains
some
serious
appeal
i
should
get
another
one
of
these
to
cellar
for
16
will
probably
be
even
better
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
rather
than
try
to
rush
through
not
a
beer
for
everyone
rather
a
beer
for
those
that
enjoy
more
than
the
typical
mainstream
or
major
craft
beers
i
think
this
has
legs
to
make
it
as
long
as
20
years
i
have
added
a
nice
stock
of
this
to
the
beer
cellar
mouthfeel
is
is
cloying
and
slightly
sweet
and
medicinal
uf
drinkability
i
forget
what
i
paod
for
this
but
for
the
chance
to
try
it
it
was
worth
the
money
doubtful
that
id
get
it
again
except
at
a
good
price
and
for
a
tasting
party
or
something
1996
bottle
2621
was
a
little
worried
about
this
cork
fill
apart
had
to
pour
thru
a
strainer
poured
dark
brown
hardly
any
head
or
lacing
aroma
got
sweetness
like
honey
and
fruits
and
some
alcohol
and
a
winey
smell
like
a
port
flavor
like
a
port
wine
with
hints
of
fruit
like
warm
raisins
or
prune
juice
finish
was
pleasant
this
will
be
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
have
as
a
after
a
great
dinner
drink
going
to
get
several
of
these
to
keep
deep
in
the
cellarbasement
this
old
ale
held
up
well
with
vintage
date
of
2003
it
poured
murky
and
brown
dark
maple
syrup
look
but
cloudy
intense
sedimentation
in
mix
too
the
smell
is
between
an
intense
honey
malt
and
fruit
grape
flavour
there
was
very
little
carbonation
that
disappeared
entirely
within
the
first
minute
this
one
is
definitely
not
for
big
gulps
and
needs
small
tastes
so
not
to
overpower
the
senses
there
is
a
heavy
mouth
feel
of
intense
dark
fruits
and
maltiness
i
detected
little
hoppiness
til
the
very
end
of
the
swallow
and
the
alcohol
was
strong
throughout
the
taste
the
bottle
says
9
abv
but
this
one
felt
stronger
than
most
trippels
it
was
a
very
interesting
experience
my
overall
thoughts
a
really
unique
and
tasty
example
of
what
an
old
ale
could
be
the
taste
on
this
has
a
bit
more
alcohol
than
the
smell
was
indicating
but
the
range
of
dark
fruit
flavours
and
the
odd
tartness
make
up
for
it
the
smell
is
the
real
showstealer
with
this
one
though
and
would
probably
be
my
1
reason
for
rebuying
assuming
that
i
could
find
another
one
gales
prize
old
ale
1996
bottle
6146
wow
a
corked
old
ale
very
nice
presentation
with
the
bottle
a
highspeed
collision
between
a
port
and
a
beer
whoa
a
heavy
oakwoody
flavor
and
nose
the
color
is
deep
mahogany
with
no
head
at
all
and
no
lace
but
who
cares
no
carbonation
hey
its
been
locked
in
a
bottle
for
a
decade
the
mouth
feel
on
this
one
is
so
heavy
it
nearly
opened
a
black
hole
in
my
mouth
man
its
dense
and
woodyand
woody
and
woody
and
dense
wow
this
is
a
sipping
beer
not
a
drinking
beer
this
defies
physics
this
beer
was
past
its
prime
too
bad
they
used
a
cork
and
didnt
cap
it
too
fullers
has
bought
gales
who
cares
very
dissapointed
aroma
was
cherry
with
tawny
port
virtually
no
head
or
lacing
body
was
murly
and
darreddish
brown
initial
flavor
was
harshly
sweet
and
salty
with
a
heavy
sweet
finish
flavor
that
lasted
way
too
long
palate
was
full
and
syrupy
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
cellar
i
dont
think
ill
drink
them
i
cant
imagine
that
this
would
get
any
better
with
age
2001
bottling
deep
ruby
colored
amber
no
head
no
carbonation
wood
and
peat
are
prevalent
in
the
nose
smoky
with
lots
of
dark
cherries
very
similar
in
flavor
to
sherry
yet
without
the
alcohol
and
much
smokier
i
could
see
pairing
this
with
a
cigar
and
i
rarely
say
that
about
any
beer
spicy
herbal
sips
like
a
wine
or
fine
liquer
as
there
is
no
carbonation
and
a
good
warming
alcoholic
presence
a
nice
fireside
nightcap
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger

house
in
nyc
this
tasty
liquid
arrives
orangy
almond
clearly
low
carbonation
minimal
head
and
little
lacing

is
of

and
figs
this
is
a
big
flavorful
brew
notes
of
raisins
rum
figs
funk
must
and
some
smoke
nicely
crafted
musty
old
stuff
slight
sourness
in
the
finish
despite
my
scores
gales
prize
old
ale
is
an
enjoyable
beer
it
isnt
the
typical
old
ale
if
such
a
thing
even
exists
but
im
not
sure
what
else
id
call
it
i
had
a
great
time
with
all
9
3
ounces
sip
by
sip
by
sip
if
youre
looking
for
a
comfort
beer
and
a
true
original
youll
find
it
here
and
in
the
rest
of
the
gale
lineup
as
well
some
would
be
scared
off
from
this
one
due
to
the
alcohol
and
probably
would
find
it
very
drinkable
but
i
think
the
opposite
i
really
enjoy
this
one
ive
had
this
in
the
past
but
im
glad
i
at
least
let
this
age
til
it
was
over
2
years
a
shame
that
it
is
retired
drinkability
one
of
the
few
old
ales
i
have
had
so
im
still
aquiring
a
taste
for
this
style
not
bad
definitely
different
if
you
are
used
to
your
brews
having
carbonation
almost
like
a
watery
cough
sryup
but
the
flavors
are
very
nice
this
one
would
probably
be
best
saved
for
the
winter
months
taste
white
port
sherry
tobacco
and
an
intriguing
sourness
that
i
enjoyed
obviously
carbonation
was
next
to
nil
an
excellent
experiment
of
cellaring
that
i
would
gladly
repeat
anytime
i
wont
buy
the
96
again
but
i
will
go
back
and
check
out
other
years
anyway
nose
is
pleasant
enough
oxidized
aromas
of
sherry
oak
soy
sauce
and
grapes
taste
is
not
bad
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
cabernet
oaky
vinous
dark
fruits
numbing
but
not
over
the
top
and
burning
alcohol
turns
cidery
and
moderately
bitter
toward
the
warming
dark
fruity
finish
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
thick
without
a
hint
of
carbonation
man
its
too
bad
because
this
would
be
a
fine
ale
with
some
ill
have
to
try
it
again
and
hope
that
i
get
a
better
cork
all
in
all
doesnt
come
close
to
2000
it
obviously
did
not
age
well
or
properly
a
disappointment
cheers

dating
paid
attention
to
all
the
directions
for
once
instead
of
wanting
it
and
realizing
there
were
rules
to
follow
and
getting
screwed
i
uncapped
and
withdrew
the
cork
slowly
set
it
out
on
the
counter
then
came
back
about
2
hours
later
when
it
was
what
we
felt
the
designated
temperature
did
the
nice
slow
pour
to
see
the
very
cloudy
chestnut
brew
with
a
nonexistant
head
not
even
a
bubble
rising
very
still
looking
raisin
and
honey
scents
sweet
and
malty
medium
and
smooth
not
really
creamy
at

just
nice
taste
of
a

very
astringent
get
a
bit
of
grain
alcohol
on
the
tongue
interesting
brew
this
was
a
very
split
experience
for
me
looked
bad
smelled
great
and
tasted
strange
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
most
certainly
should
be
laid
down
at
least
a
couple
of
years
to
remove
the
unpleasant
parts
of
it
1999
vintage
ruddy
copper

with
not
much
of
a

to
speak
of
aromas
are
of
dark

and
a
bit

the
taste
follows
suit

this

and
complex
english

shine

in

flavour
is
a

raw
in
the
edges
as

for

theres
plenty
of
sweet

not
cloying
flavour
elements
of

and
old

just
enough
hops
to
stand
up
to
the

mouthfeel
i
suspect
the
abv
had
already
crept
well
above
the
stated

this
beer
really
is
something
special
now
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
available
for
cellaring
and
the
character
to
keep
them
for
a
few
years
clear
orangebrown
fine
head
initially
but
it
quickly
consists
of
swiftly
fading
big
bubbles
and
disappears
from
the
face
of
this
pond
loud
malty
cherries
hit
the
nose
in
their
lambicy
funkiness
great
wood
character
works
very
well
with
cinnamon
like
flavors
somehow
in
mouth
this
vinegary
concoction
manages
to
deploy
layers
of
floral
interstice
all
around
the
tart
chocolate
and
woody
malts
liquorous
medium
body
displays
particularly
low
carbonation
pretty
good
despite
being
on
the
limit
of
having
a
bad
cork
pours
a
murky
brown
body
with
absolutely
no
carbonation
completely
flat
without
the
slightest
trace
of
head
the
alcohol
burns
spicy
in
the
sinuses
followed
by
dried
fruit
like
raisins
and
apricots
a
good
bit
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
a
little
on
the
thin
side
until
it
warms
a
lot
i
get
an
interesting
bit
of
toasted
pecans
in
the
end
that
is
quite
pleasant
the
stillness
is
a
bit
annoying
in
the
mouthfeel
though
sweet
caramel
and
nuts
the
aging
really
seems
to
have
smoothed
out
this
beer
and
made
it
drinkable
its
flavorful
and
the
sourness
really
balances
the
alcohol
taste
im
very
surprised
at
how
easy
to
drink
this
is
especially
when
you
consider
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
the
strength
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
of
this
soon
maybe
try
different
vintages
and
compare
the
results
a
tasty
old
ale
recommended
im
not
sure
how
drinkable
this
beast
is
little
flat
and
fat
for
me
oh
it
just
struck
me
that
this
beer
got
a
lot
in
common
with
the
few
unblended
belgian
lambrics
that
i
have
drunk
in
the
past
i
did
not
review
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
1997
vintage
because
it
had
obviously
spoiled
but
when
a
beer
is
bad
2
out
of
2
times
i
have
to
chalk
it
off
as
a
lousy
beer
i
might
feel
differently
if
i
had
tried
the
same
vintage
both
times

allowing

and
warm
for
a
bit
its
not
like
im
losing
any

sip
purveyed
a
viscous

and
a
subtle

it
struggles
like
there
was
some

in
there
at
one
point
but
the
alphas
are
long
gone
other
than
some
residual
grapeskinlike
vinousness
whats
left
is
a
potent
snifter
of

funkiness
a
very
intruiging
brew
it
comes
across
at
times
as
having
cheeselike
and
winelike
qualities
to
it
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
beer
and
i
opt
for
the
8
year
old
version
id
like
to
try
a
nonvintage
bottle
next
time
and
maybe
taste
some
fuggles
and
goldings
the
beer
after
uncorking

sets
in

with

no

very
old
semigloss
paint
blended
with

old

start
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
decent
bit
of
malt
top
is
light
in
feel
finish
is
devoid
of
carbonation
and
the
hops
very
light
bleached
desert
bone
dry
after
taste
certainly
a
unique
blend
of
aromas
and
taste
i
will
leave
this
to
the
true
experts
but
to
be
completely
honest
it
has
certain
morbid
attraction
and
i
liked
its
different
aromas
and
taste
well
ive
always
been
abbynormal
lol
the
body
is
nice
its
a
heavy
buttery
slow
drinker
full
bodied
and
warming
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
that
is
developed
by
a
slight
carbonation
the
aroma
is
a
heady
mix
of
malt
sourness
and
alcohol
the
sweet
and
sour
combination
is
reminiscent
of
cherries
the
taste
is
an
interesting
mix
of
sour
salty
and
meaty
mmm
sounds
like
a
meal
this
beer
is
slightly
oxidized
in
flavor
but
this
adds
a
certain
richness
to
the
beer
this
is
a
nice
sipping
brew
with
some
notes
akin
to
a
flemish
sour
ale
slight
vinegar
rich
maltiness
sour
and
balsamic
this
grows
on
me
more
and
more
as
i
sip
it
the
mix
of
flavors
really
start
to
work
well
together
still
not
something
i
would
want
to
have
all
that
often
overall
i
am
mostly
satisfied
with
this
beer
considering
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
old
ale
notes
this
beer
will
likely
never
be
a
favorite
of
mine
it
would
however
make
an
excellent
replacement
for
a
port
or
a
sherry
when
served
with
dark
chocolates
etc
i
would
even
suggest
splitting
one
bottle
between
two
people
and
serving
this
in
sherry
glasses
this
was
purchased
as
a
1996
vintage
at
the
awesome
greens
discount
beverage
store
on
buford
highway
the
bottle
has
an
odd
275
ml
volume
and
is
brown
with
a
red
paper
covering
the
cork
inset
in
the
neck
the
look
of
the
beer
is
like
dried
blood
reddish
murky
black
with
no
carbonation
at
all
the
aroma
is
sweetly
vinous
with
cherries
raisins
and
prunes
dancing
around
the
taste
is
crumbly
velvety
chocolate
malt
underlain
by
spiced
alcohol
warmth
there
are
also
the
odd
oxidized
flavors
of
cough
syrup
leather
sweaty
socks
and
musk
by
this
time
all
indications
of
any
hops
are
long
gone
and
the
taste
is
bit
too
one
dimensional
i
think
there
are
better
old
ales
out
there
what
the
heck
is
this
it
must
be
old
or
infected
i
see
there
are
some
other
reviews
like
mine
which
makes
me
wonder
if
this
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
i
couldnt
finish
this
beer
and
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
try
it
again
unless
i
was
in
britain
and
it
was
fresh
from
the
brewery
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
no
real
head
to
be
seen
it
had
a
brandy
like
aroma
with
alcohol
vinous
fruits
and
some
woody
aspects
in
it
flavor
was
very
complex
and
intriging
sweet
vinous
flavors
upfront
and
some
figs
plums
raisins
to
go
along
with
that
middle
was
spicy
and
i
noticed
more
of
a
nonfruit
dark
malt
taste
as
well
alcohol
became
quite
prevalent
in
the
finish
along
with
a
tarty
aspect
that
lingered
the
body
was
thicker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
this
beer
seemed
to
improve
as
it
warmed
allowing
more
flavors
to
come
forth
my
only
problem
is
such
an
expensive
price
for
such
a
little
bottle
otherwise
very
nice
nightcap
pours
as
a
nearly
still
liquid
with
a
shadowy
quickly
disappearing
tan
head
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
cloudiness
resinlike
woody
vinuous
aroma
with
an
underripened
pear
apple
smell
alcohol
aroma
is
certainly
present
but
its
hidden
behind
the
other
smells
full
and
warming
sensation
throughout
the
taste
finish
has
an
alcohol
bite
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
theres
a
molasseslike
undertone
in
the
taste
as
well
its
a
very
enjoyable
contemplative
complex
beerbut
i
think
that
it
may
have
been
a
little
young
and
roughedged
id
like
to
try
one
that
was
a
few
years
older
burnt
sienna

appearance
reddish

that
reminds
me
a
little
of
apple
cores
and
sport
peppers
tart
and
peppery
almost
at
the
same
time
a
good
beer
lots
of
complexity
slightly
plasticy
phenolics
seem
to
arise
on
later
sips
drinkability
is
medium
theres
a
lot
weighing
on
your
senses
here
taste
is
flat
no
carbonation
whatsoever
slightly
sweet
with
some
tart
fruitinessblack
raspberries
is
my
perception
ethanol
is
very
much
in
evidence
i
could
not
have
finished
this
one
if
it
were
a
12
oz
serving
finishes
like
a
wood
smoked
port
wine
be
careful
with
this
one
the
alcohol
may
not
be
as
evident
in
the
taste
as
in
the
aroma
but
it
will
quickly
alert
your
brain
cells
another
disapointment
from
gales
i
wont
blame
the
fall
of
the
british
empire
on
this
one
but
ive
had
much
better
maybe
im
just
getting
the
wrong
vintage
at
the
wrong
time
or
i
just
dont
like
ales
that
look
and
taste
like
wine
i
feel
this
brew
may
be
a
year
or
two
past
its
prime
as
im
finding
the
structure
of
the
body
seems
to
be
wearing
down
a
somewhat
salty
flavor
begins
to
intrude
and
the
flavors
and
tastes
are
separating
instead
of
blending
harmoniously
i
need
to
try
the
1999
version
next
2002
vintage

a
dark
brew

almost

and
body
is
between
medium
to
strong
it
is
the
first
time
i
tried
an
old
ale
and
find
it
similar
to
some
barleywine
that
i
tried
before
overall
a
great
beer
and
even
greater
bottle
with
cork
ill
try
to
get
my
hand
on
some
more
of
these
to
aged
them
poured
a
murkey
brown
with
a
dime
thin
head
the
aroma
was
muted
oak
spice
bourbon
the
flavors
were
almost
shery
like
little
carbonation
more
like
a
flat
oxidized
wine
than
an
old
ale
some
oak
and
spice
flavors
with
middle
of
the
road
alcohol
flavors
i
had
hoped
for
more
as
the
glass
warmed
it
improved
a
little
but
not
the
beer
i
was
seeking
vintage
1998
9
2oz
bottle
color
is
a
deep
muddy
brown
with
super
nice
dark
ruby
highlights
within
medium
sized
soft
spongy
beige
head
that
sits
a
while
before
misting
away
lace
is
fast
dripping
in
sheets
with
minimal
stickage
aroma
is
light
of
mostly
ethonalic
alcohol
and
phenolic
cleaners
with
some
notes
of
pruney
fruityness
ans
a
bit
of
sweet
oakyness
kinda
vinous
with
a
kick
taste
has
the
flavors
derived
in
the
smell
with
a
bit
more
liking
quite
vinous
with
a
sweet
oakyness
a
bit
tartly
too
prunes
and
sweet
green
raisins
make
the
mold
of
sweetening
along
with
a
milding
grab
of
sourness
most
of
the
alcohol
noted
in
the
nose
barley
make
any
appearance
within
the
taste
really
good
feel
medium
to
full
with
a
mild
yet
lively
character
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
bit
weird
compared
to
some
of
the
same
style
but
drinkable
and
interestingly
good
if
it
wasnt
so
darn
small
i
would
say
that
this
one
was
one
of
the
best
that
ive
tried
but
man
9
3
oz
for
this
beer
is
just
not
enough
which
i
suppose
is
a
complement
in
and
of
itself
medium
bodied
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
a
little
chewy
in
the
finish
certainly
a
sippin
beer
wish
those
bottles
werent
so
damn
small
though
would
have
liked
to
sip
a
little
more
taste
most
unusual
anise
jumps
on
board
the
palate
joining
molasses
and
plums
rum
and
raisins
sweet
and
sticky
prominent
malt
but
nary
a
hop
to
be
heard
from
and
a
long
lingering
finish
halfway
in
this
messy
monster
starts
to
tame
and
feels
almost
mellow
but
that
is
to
laugh
alcohol
content
comes
through
then
too
and
does
its
warming
business
not
to
mention
other
effects
a
perfect
winter
warmup
an
excellent
tonic
against
latedecember
chill
this
time
i
felt
that
the
cute
little
gales
9
3
oz
bottle
was
a
mistake
and
i
could
take
a
bit
more
of
the
stuff
for
the
glass
emptied
before
i
wanted
it
to
gets
darkier
and
fruitier
toward
the
end
while
that
9
tiptoes
up
to
the
cranium
to
do
its
dirty
work
a
choice
sledgehammer
indeed
to
send
me
off
to
dreamland
deep
burgundy
color
lacking
carbonation
head
or
lacing
obviously
the
cork
was
extracted
in
good
condition
intense
vinous
aroma
incredibly
portlike
with
caramel
tawny
port
grapes
alcohol
and
a
slight
bit
of
black
licorice
burnt
chocolate
caramel
port
and
corkyoaky
flavors
persist
additional
notes
of
overripe
fruit
and
residual
malt
sugars
are
prevalent
as
well
in
addition
to
toffee
and
vanilla
flavors
which
are
imparted
by
the
wood
syrupy
lifeless
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
viscous
and
oily
that
it
lends
very
little
to
this
brew
even
though
its
expected
this
is
a
definite
sipper
no
doubt
but
it
seems
to
be
so
overly
complex
that
it
cannot
be
enjoyed
on
its
own
even
the
usually
miniscule
nineounce
bottle
seems
to
be
more
than
sufficient
in
this
case
its
almost
a
chore
to
drink
more
than
half
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
beer
wellsuited
for
an
intense
cigar
dark
chocolate
or
other
rich
desserts
it
simply
doesnt
work
by
itself
at
least
at
this
point
in
its
life
its
almost
eight
years
old
while
this
particular
sample
stood
out
in
some
categories
but
not
in
others
its
longevity
is
most
impressive
a
must
try
for
fans
of
tawny
port
poured
with
no
head
at
all
and
no
carbonation
whatsoever
has
a
murky
brownish
color
that
gets
lighter
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
good
thick
sludge
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
has
a
woody
vanilla
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark
dried
fruits
plums
raisins
figs
with
a
good
wift
of
alcohol
watery
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
cocoacoffee
taste
either
i
had
a
mishandled
bottle
or
this
is
past
its
prime
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
disappointing
drinkability
corked
bottle
i
presume
i
hope
the
2nd
one
i
purchased
isnt
like
this
ill
crack
that
puppy
open
sometime
and
rereview
maybe
grabbing
a
more
recent
vintage
just
to
make
sure
this
particular
bottle
went
bad
maybe
i
drank
this
one
a
little
too
early
but
i
have
had
older
versions
before
for
only
3
99
for
the
bottle
i
was
interested
to
see
what
the
poa
offered
after
only
2
years
probably
best
to
leave
this
about
5
years
to
let
the
beer
mellow
a
bit
however
i
have
to
admit
that
as
a
gueuze
fan
i
was
really
quite
partial
to
the
extreme
sourness
the
2001
exhibited
this
of
course
may
not
endear
the
2
year
old
poa
to
all
palates
i
had
the
1996
vintage
very
dark
color
little
head
fruity
raisiny
nose
taste
was
completely
sour
i
have
had
a
younger
bottle
98
i
believe
in
the
past
that
was
much
less
sour
and
more
malty
it
tasted
like
a
poor
mans
hardy
lighter
in
flavor
and
much
less
complex
i
happen
to
really
enjoy
sour
beers
so
i
was
not
disappointed
but
if
you
have
this
vintage
and
dont
dont
want
it
totally
sour
you
may
want
to
drink
up
soon
the
1996
vintage
is
probably
not
a
good
example
of
the
old
ale
style
as
tasted
in
2003
which
is
why
the
score
is
a
bit
low
even
though
drinking
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable

and
a
slight
sourness
with
dries
the

a

but
not
as
sour
as
this
beer
can
sometimes
be
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
for
a
old
ale
but
works
quite
fine
with
this
beer
balance
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
despite
age
and
complexity
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
but
it
was
not
what
i
expected
corked
1998
bottle
poured
with
no
head
i
almost
sent
it
back
until
the
barkeep
said
theyre
all
like
that
mouthfeel
is
obviously
watery
and
a
little
syrupy
color
is
dark
caramel
with
a
raisin
smell
flavor
is
mostly
sour
and
alcoholic
but
some
notes
of
caramel
and
raisin
emerge
it
became
more
like
sipping
port
or
cognac
but
i
couldnt
get
my
mind
to
totally
believe
that
due
to
the
sourness
couldnt
finish
the
glass
well
found
this
up
in
buffalo
at
premiere

and
decided
on
the
98
vintagepours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
no
head
or
carbonation
to
speak
ofaroma
is
woody
and
raisiny
sweet
the
taste
is
pretty
odd
raisiny
and
portlike
but
also
an
annoying
sourness
to
it
that
makes
it
a
litle
hard
to
drink
there
are
some
nicethings
going
on
with
this
beer
but
the
little
sour
tinge
to
it
kinda
ruins
the
moment

a

treat
i
am
definitly
going
to
look
for
this
one
again
and
keep
it
on
the
shelve
for
a
while
this
one
was
nearly
four
years
old
and
full
of
flavors
overall
the
nose
is
great
and
the
taste
is
very
good
but
the
body
leaves
something
to
be
desired
definitely
worth
trying
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
though
this
beer
pours
dark
and
the
aroma
isnt
great
scents
of
grapes
but
not
as
pleasing
as
one
would
expect
the
taste
is
that
of
a
polish
dark
beer
that
is
very
watered
down
there
really
isnt
any
carbonation
in
this
beer
but
it
is
corked
so
that
was
not
expected
i
did
not
like
the
taste
very
much
vintage
1996
poured
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
absolutley
no
head
no
lacing
and
no
carbonation
very
mild
aroma
of
candied
fruit
and
tobacco
the
taste
however
was
syrupy
sweet
like
a
good
sherry
but
with
some
tartness
thrown
in
the
finish
definetly
a
after
dinner
sipper
this
beer
is
a
deep
deep
crimson
color
absolutely
no
carbonation
is
visible
with
the
pour
no
head
no
collar
no
co2
bubbles
no
lacing
but
this
is
6
years
old
and
of
high
av
on
the
nose
i
get
mud
russet
potates
uncooked
whole
ones
cough
syrup
vapor
bread
pudding
and
rum
on
to
the
flavors
a
little
wood
a
little
rum
a
little
brown
sugar
a
little
bark
a
little
dark
fruits
and
a
little
dates
and
raisins
all
together
though
not
a
lot
of
anything
real
tasty
pretty
average
mouthfeel
is
lacing
carbonation
and
almost
syrupy

9
3
ounces
oh
yeah
ill
use
my
beer
money
on
something
else
next
time
the
harvest
ales
kick
the
shit
out
of
this
one
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
whatsoever
which
is
basically
what
i
was
expecting
nose
is
intense
with
aromas
of
sweet
dark
fruit
and
molasses
blended
with
some
tobacco
and
green
apple
peel
with
some
additional
slightly
stinging
alcohol
that
resembles
a
raisiny
port
fairly
full
in
body
with
zero
carbonation
creating
a
velvety
smooth
texture
taste
begins
with
roasted
dark
malts
and
semiripened
blackberries
followed
by
a
bit
of
burnt
caramel
some
earthy
flavors
of
wood
mostly
oak
and
leather
come
across
towards
the
middle
followed
by
some
strong
notes
of
heavy
red
wine
and
a
bit
of
raisiny
sweetness
quite
a
complex
beer
that
is
to
be
drunk
slowly
and
every
sip
savored
i
think
this
would
do
just
fine
if
aged
for
a
few
more
years
make
sure
that
you
dont
drink
this
beer
too
cold
the
bottle
recommends
room
temperature
thanks
to
faernt
for
the
sample
1999
bottle
this
was
anything
but
a
good
beer
experience
yuck
is
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
there
was
no
head
when
this
beer
was
poured
and
there
was
no
lacing
either
the
body
was
cloudy
and
the
hue
was
dark
brown
i
could
not
decide
what
the
nose
was
of
this
beer
i
could
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
i
also
observed
a
bitter
aftertaste
with
this
beer
this
bottle
was
labeled
from
year
1999
it
had
a
very
interesting
aroma
its
aroma
was
different
than
i
have
smelled
thus
far
it
was
hard
to
describe
initial
reaction
to
the
aroma
is
what
the
devil
is
this
it
poured
no
head
at
all
with
a
very
thick
cloudy
dark
brown
body
it
left
no
lacing
at
all
tastes
like
wine
perhaps
grapes
no
real
fore
taste
and
some
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
it
is
failing
the
gf
test
and
she
may
not
drink
it
all
you
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
it
is
definitely
a
different
kind
of
brew
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
tasted
of
alcohol
oak
prunes
molasses
very
similar
to
a
port
but
slightly
off
it
would
take
some
getting
used
to
but
i
could
come
to
enjoy
this
as
an
after
dinner
drink
would
be
great
with
some
deserts
this
beer
poured
with
very
little
head
which
was
not
surprising
for
a
cask
the
appearance
was
a
deep
golden
red
color
and
fairly
clear
it
had
a
rich
malt
and
alcohol
aroma
the
initial
taste
was
carmel
apple
and
sweet
raisin
somewhat
bittersweet
middle
with
a
nice
mild
hop
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
dark
reddish
brown
fairly
clear
yet
still
rather
dark
no
apparent
carbonation
in
the
body
very
faint
head
no
retention
whatsoever
very
vinous
carameltofee
aroma
big
presence
of
fruit
in
the
smell
and
taste
seems
to
be
an
odd
but
good
combination
of
sweet
apple
and
slightly
sour
cherry
big
carameltoffee
presence
in
the
flavor
spicy
as
well
im
not
sure
but
there
seemed
to
be
hints
of
nutmeg
in
this
one
slight
fruity
aftertaste
and
fairly
dry
fullbodied
creamy
brew
this
should
have
been
my
nightcap
alas
there
were
beers
i
had
not
yet
met
as
some
others
have
noted
this
is
a
strange
beer
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
with
a
shot
of
booze
in
it
fairly
smooth
and
certainly
warming
quite
unique
but
i
wont
go
back
for
this
one
no
head
or
lacing
sweet
and
smooth
i
was
feeling
a
little
off
tonight
and
this
was
good
medicine
but
i
have
had
many
many
ales
that
are
more
enjoyable
and
several
barley
wines
also
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
nuttylooking
head
smells
buttery
and
nutty
and
tastes
buttery
and
nutty
or
is
it
butty
and
nuttery
my
point
is
that
these
two
flavorsvibes
dominate
feels
slippery
in
the
mouth
and
a
little
sweet
which
hurts
the
drinkability
very
good
beer
overall
great
for
one
this
was
a
recommended
by
the
owner
of
a
beer
store
i
frequent
so
i
gave
it
a
try
looked
promising
in
its
corked
bottlebrewed
2001
and
poured
deep
amber
with
very
little
head
taste
was
almost
like
a
barley
wine
sweet
and
very
malty
mouthfeel
very
fizzy
and
carbonated
also
an
alcahol
taste
i
didnt
care
for
it
has
a
sweet
apple
start
then
you
are
hit
with
the
strongest
alcohol
taste
i
have
ever
witnessed
in
a
beer
it
tastes
more
like
90
proof
vodka
than
9
beer
it
mellows
out
a
bit
to
make
it
much
easier
to
stand
there
is
no
carbonation
but
it
has
a
lot
of
bite
from
the
alcohol
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
lots
of
flavor
unfortunately
the
smash
in
your
face
of
alcohol
is
a
lot
of
that
flavor
the
bottle
says
to
drink
this
ale
at
room
temperature
and
they
are
right
this
ale
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
coffee
color
with
absolutely
no
foam
whatsoever
the
smell
was
absolutely
wonderful
and
was
probably
the
best
aspect
of
this
sample
i
just
sniffed
and
savored
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
with
aromas
of
oak
and
grapes
and
raisins
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
a
trace
of
coffee
alcohol
some
oak
and
some
hints
of
phenols
and
pine
as
well
as
musty
grapes
and
raisins
there
was
not
much
hop
presence
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
flat
no
carbonation
medium
bodied
velvety
smooth
and
fairly
clean
despite
the
slight
sweetness
the
drinkability
was
good
but
as
mentioned
above
this
ale
needs
to
be
served
at
room
temperature
to
be
fully
enjoyed
not
bad
and
the
store
has
more
where
this
came
from
i
now
wish
i
would
have
tackled
more
beers
like
this
before
sampling
the
aforementioned
sa
triple
bock
just
to
have
a
better
appreciation
of
these
styles
of
brews
my
beer
education
continues
pours
to
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
or
carbonation
for
that
matter
the
aroma
is
sweet
bread
and
smells
of
raisins
and
prunes
you
can
also
smell
the
alcohol
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
beer
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
in
the
front
then
it
has
a
flavor
of
prunes
into
the
finish
is
a
sour
tartness
like
that
of
green
apples
overall
it
is
an
interesting
beer
this
is
my
first
old
ale
so
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
complex
flavors
and
aromas
still
like
this
a
lot
and
it
is
different
from
any
other
brew
ive
had
no
hint
of
9
alcohol
other
than
the
rosy
glow
in
my
cheeks
and
the
slightly
stupid
smile
on
my
face
strange
little
brew
but
it
grew
on
me
very
different
a
very
nice
dark
fruit
vinegary
acidity
from
the
middle
of
the
palate
to
the
finish
also
has
hints
of
berries
more
towards
the
start
i
think
very
unique
i
enjoyed
this
one
1998
vintage
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
old
ales
i
have
ever
tried
nice
brwon
amber
color
and
extremely
smooth
body
with
the
perfect
level
of
sweetness
awesome
pours
into
the
glass
with
zero
carbonation
opaque
almost
purpleish
color
nose
is
of
dark
fruits
and
raisins
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
present
first
taste
is
pruney
winey
dry
mouthfeel
is
slightly
similar
to
sam
adams
triple
bock
only
not
nearly
as
syrupy
a
short
finish
with
a
lingering
astringency
not
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
thick
syrupy
mouths
feel
with
barely
any
carbonation
at
all
slight
granny
smith
apple
like
tartness
up
front
tartness
is
not
too
much
blackberries
and
raisins
mark
the
fruitiness
in
this
ale
light
roasted
lingering
black
malt
twang
in
the
middle
liken
to
mild
black
coffee
hops
are
a
faded
memory
leaving
a
vague
bitterness
warming
alcohol
and
a
grainy
woodycorky
apple
peel
and
cracker
like
malt
slowly
fade
into
the
finish
age
has
been
kind
to
this
beer
the
brett
charter
has
brought
dark
fruits
fwd
while
imparting
leather
and
english
saddle
to
nose
overall
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
it
i
just
remember
an
acetic
mess
last
time
i
had
a
bottle
this
has
a
much
more
controlled
brett
flavor
with
an
enormous
amount
of
molasses
feel
is
good
but
for
the
style
would
like
to
see
less
carbonation
not
good
as
an
old
ale
but
good
as
a
beer
i
regret
buying
two
of
these
i
highly
recommend
not
to
buy
it
such
a
strange
beer
here
almost
like
a
stingo
with
the
tannic
acidity
of
the
wine
and
a
funk
to
it
beyond
what
we
are
used
to
in
barleywine
and
old
ale
as
we
know
them
murky
dark
brown
amber
colored
beer
thick
and
sludgy
but
still
rather
carbonated
by
the
looks
of
it
with
a
nice
tall
chai
tea
latte
colored
head
the
nose
is
really
barrel
influenced
tons
of
red
grape
character
and
if
i
was
told
this
was
made
with
must
or
juice
i
wouldnt
argue
it
light
acidity
from
the
vino
lots
of
fruit
the
grain
marries
in
well
but
this
is
different
from
almost
anything
ive
ever
had
its
not
sweet
at
all
instead
super
dry
carbonation
is
enormous
too
which
you
almost
never
see
in
this
style
but
its
already
nothing
like
anything
in
the
old
ale
style
ive
seen
burnt
cherry
and
dark
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
from
the
grain
and
wine
barrel
mellow
oaken
middle
with
a
zippy
and
tannic
finish
this
must
be
first
use
barrels
or
have
spent
eons
in
the
barrels
its
just
so
wine
forward
its
rare
these
days
that
i
find
a
beer
that
challenges
me
like
this
its
always
cool
to
find
something
so
unfamiliar
and
well
put
together
i
dont
like
it
half
as
much
as
the
saisons
upright
does
but
i
have
to
tip
my
hat
and
commend
this
beer
there
is
really
nothing
like
it
i
see
this
as
post
thanksgiving
dinner
beer
maybe
i
will
revisit
it
in
that
context
pricey
but
worth
checking
out
if
you
have
a
curious
palate
overall
reminds
me
a
lot
of
great
divides
hibernation
but
more
pricey
and
not
quite
as
good
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
cola
like
was
surprised
to
see
this
had
some
brett
didnt
pick
that
up
at
all
pour
is
murky
and
muddy
dark
brown
with
virtually
no
head
nose
is
heavy
dark
malt
molasses
caramel
brown
sugar
dark
berries
all
mixed
together
and
not
really
working
well
as
a
group
taste
is
brutal
overly
sweet
and
messy
malts
sugars
with
burnt
grain
and
burnt
caramel
overly
sweet
berries
with
just
way
too
much
sugar
body
is
full
adding
to
the
unpleasantly
with
virtually
no
carbonation
i
was
expecting
interesting
tastes
from
this
brew
but
upright
missed
the
mark
ive
read
countless
articles
of
tartsour
english
porters
but
an
old
ale
and
this
sour
the
beer
was
incredibly
unbalanced
and
unfortunately
nondrinkable
hints
of
something
lurking
behind
the
sourness
was
evident
my
suggestion
leave
the
sourness
to
the
belgians
o
an
interesting
beer
but
could
benefit
from
some
balance
to
round
out
the
very
sharp
tartness
update
5513
seems
this
isnt
my
style
as
friends
of
my
brother
are
saying
what
i
got
was
representative
of
the
brew
and
they
like
it
so
ymmv
o
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
enjoyed
the
slight
funk
but
i
think
the
fruits
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
balanced
maybe
itll
get
more
rounded
and
better
with
age
but
im
not
sure
that
well
cross
paths
again
either
way
fun
to
try
d
i
appreciated
the
effort
but
not
exactly
uprights
best
a
little
disjointed
and
coarse
also
a
bit
different
than
your
average
old
ale
o
extremely
disappointed
i
snagged
this
bottle
from
apexs
cooler
just
three
days
ago
o
unique
drinkable
and
generally
pleasant
would
buy
again
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
a
seasonal
i
will
definitely
look
forward
to
each
year
now
thanks
to
eric
for
sharing
this
o
old
ale
meets
a
sour
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
before
pretty
good
id
buy
this
again
overall
an
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
definitely
worth
a
try
i
guess
this
is
the
first
beer
made
by
upright
so
i
have
in
my
glass
a
piece
of
portland
history
this
beer
could
definitely
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
a
bit
more
liveliness
would
really
help
the
flavors
and
aromas
pop
too
the
aroma
especially
and
the
flavor
are
a
little
too
dominated
by
the
oak
character
the
oak
character
is
significantly
spicy
enough
that
it
seems
to
drown
out
the
complexity
of
the
base
beer
the
malt
especially
seems
to
be
quite
a
bit
more
reduced
than
one
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
color
and
gravity
in
the
end
the
oak
and
the
brett
and
a
little
bit
of
the
wine
contribute
more
to
the
profile
of
this
beer
than
the
base
beer
does
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
could
see
this
recipe
and
oak
aging
process
being
dialed
in
a
lot
more
tightly
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
a
great
beer
is
hiding
here
somewhere
and
i
would
love
for
upright
to
keep
trying
to
improve
this
beer
so
that
they
can
get
there
overall
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
fit
its
own
description
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
dark
fruit
with
some
nice
toffee
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
few
welcome
additions
i
get
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
but
there
is
some
nice
tartness
to
it
i
also
get
some
toffee
and
alcohol
as
the
beer
warms
i
get
some
flavors
that
resemble
dry
red
wine
as
well
as
some
brett
notes
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
unique
but
i
didnt
love
either
batch
enough
to
buy
it
again
will
look
forward
to
a
draft
version
for
batch
3
taste
is
lightly
tart
with
a
dark
fruit
and
caramel
flavor
bitter
on
the
finish
and
i
dont
think
it
is
the
hops
i
want
to
say
some
spices
are
involved
here
but
i
cant
be
entirely
sure
by
far
my
least
favorite
of
the
usually
outstanding
upright
beers
i
have
had
tough
for
me
to
even
finish
my
half
of
the
750
d
the
drinkability
is
highly
enhanced
by
boring
nature
of
this
beer
the
lack
of
complexities
makes
this
easy
to
drink
without
thinking
about
it
that
and
the
9
1
abv
never
really
shows
up
in
all
its
glory
since
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
going
to
call
this
slightly
above
average
3
55
truthfully
i
think
this
leans
more
towards
an
oud
bruin
rather
than
a
brett
inflected
english
old
ale
which
is
too
bad
as
i
was
expecting
more
dark
fruits
and
malt
in
the
beer
overall
still
id
love
to
see
how
it
ages
out
in
the
bottle
interesting
beer
no
doubt
but
im
not
sure
this
is
a
beer
ill
want
to
revisit
any
time
soon
d
its
not
undrinkable
but
its
uninteresting
kind
of
has
an
experimental
homebrew
vibe
right
now
drinkability
is
good
its
a
pretty
smooth
strong
ale
more
bsda
then
old
ale
but
i
realize
that
is
how
upright
billed
it
so
no
really
complaints
about
the
style
designation
id
drink
this
one
now
if
youre
holding
it
in
the
cellar
the
richness
of
the
malt
will
only
continue
to
thin
by
the
brett
it
started
out
kind
of
boring
but
the
depth
increased
as
it
warmed
and
the
smoothness
speaks
to
the
execution
particularly
due
to
the
obtuse
style
love
the
labels
on
these
upright
seasonals
active
head
that
settles
quickly
into
a
dense
pillowy
foam
the
beer
itself
is
a
murky
brown
that
doesnt
settle
out
smell
is
unusual
prune
and
caramel
with
slight
brett
funk
taste
leads
with
vanilla
and
a
slight
tartness
followed
by
brown
sugartoffee
characteristic
dark
fruit
and
a
long
vinous
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
slick
and
carbonation
is
high
but
dense
this
beer
is
really
really
terrific
almost
like
a
belgian
old
ale
whatever
that
might
be
will
have
to
track
down
some
more
bottles
would
love
to
see
what
another
year
or
five
does
to
this
overall
the
saison
qualities
sat
heavy
while
the
other
qualities
i
was
looking
for
werent
there
like
a
more
barleywine
dominance
overall
it
was
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
and
the
yeastbrett
took
over
worth
the
try
but
i
cant
see
giving
this
an
a
sofar
i
am
a
much
bigger
fan
of
uprights
lighter
brews
4
alcohol
was
well
hidden
though
i
might
add
d
9
really
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
at
this
high
level
of
alcohol
that
ive
experienced
in
hindsight
i
didnt
need
to
and
shouldnt
have
split
this
one
the
alcohol
was
so
restrained
but
did
build
moderately
after
34
of
the
pint
very
nice
beer
but
i
would
like
to
see
some
age
on
it
and
find
out
what
direction
the
brett
goes
maybe
next
year
the
rating
pertains
to
batch
1
if
i
was
rating
the
latter
it
would
be
33332
5
oaky
and
nutty
pours
a
dark
brown
really
enjoyed
this
hm
it
is
strange
they
decided
to
change
the
name
although
its
same
strong
suffolk
i
love
poured
from
a
bottle
named
greene
king
strong
suffolk
dark
ale
with
a
picture
of
a
bull
on
the
label
the
beer
is
a
dark
crystal
clear
ruby
coloring
with
no
head
pretty
vibrant
in
the
glass
nose
of
very
sweet
rich
toffee
tangy
caramel
sugary
sweetness
fig
date
and
hints
of
roast
very
sweet
throughout
flavors
of
plum
date
dark
cherry
and
roasted
toffee
all
on
a
bready
and
sugary
backbone
very
slick
oily
robust
bodied
with
an
old
world
fruit
rich
and
sweet
aftertaste
rich
dark
sweet
linger
on
a
slick
smooth
finish
big
beer
poured
from
a
half
liter
while
sitting
in
my
house
london
still
working
my
way
through
so
many
english
brews
i
havent
tried
before
moving
here
mostly
interested
in
seeing
how
this
compared
to
old
peculiar
brown
not
much
else
to
say
not
much
head
or
staying
power
but
could
be
the
glass
wasnt
cleaned
properly
nose
light
malt
with
that
old
ale
stale
hop
smell
i
find
it
odd
that
im
starting
to
like
that
a
little
bit
after
smelling
it
in
so
many
beers
here
overall
flavor
and
mouthfeel
seemed
to
style
based
on
the
other
english
old
ales
ive
had
here
enjoyable
but
probably
not
everyones
bag
pretty
good
beer
i
really
need
to
do
a
sidebyside
with
old
peculiar
and
will
update
this
review
if
i
get
around
to
that
so
i
feel
a
little
unfair
at
reviewing
this
ale
as
its
not
really
my
bag
pours
to
a
very
dark
red
almost
brown
colour
with
a
head
which
quickly
disappears
making
this
ale
appear
flat
smells
like
christmas
cake
with
spices
malt
and
treacle
coming
through
tastes
lighter
than
its
appearance
would
suggest
and
lingers
long
after
swallowing
there
will
be
people
who
love
this
beer
but
im
not
one
of
them
but
thats
down
to
my
taste
rather
than
the
ale
would
buy
again
dark
brown
color
good
beige
head
aroma
of
fruits
malt
wood
taste
is
malty
fruity
with
notes
of
oak
and
chocolate
hint
of
sourness
light
bitterness
in
finish
very
good
beer
the
smokey
vinous
quality
is
welcome
though
the
malt
presence
is
disappointingly
subdued
nevertheless
visually
appealing
with
a
terrific
aroma
and
ultimately
quite
enjoyable
started
very
well
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
various
fruits
held
up
well
right
until
then
end
when
it
started
to
fade
ever
so
slightly
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
falls
short
of
being
a
great
one
the
only
beer
ive
ever
had
that
i
would
rate
a
5
all
around
appearance
is
a
rich
dark
red
almost
brown
small
head
flavor
is
instantly
fruitcake
then
smoky
and
finished
off
by
anise
velvety
texture
which
only
enhances
it
is
amazing
even
if
you
only
try
this
once
it
is
absolutely
worth
it
overall
its
interesting
to
go
directly
from
the
bruerys
coton
to
olde
suffollk
both
beers
are
great
examples
of
the
style
but
on
completely
opposite
ends
of
the
spectrum
for
alcohol
by
volume
both
have
been
aged
to
perfection
both
have
a
minimal
contribution
from
hops
both
have
rich
dark
cherry
and
brown
sugar
flavors
but
one
clocks
in
at
14
5
and
the
other
is
6
0
its
enlightening
to
see
that
these
old
ale
flavors
can
develop
regardless
of
the
alcohol
i
guess
you
could
call
olde
suffolk
a
sessionalbe
old
ale
4
255
easily
drinkable
and
smooth
i
love
the
distant
sour
notes
of
the
5x
and
the
way
it
balances
with
the
fruity
sweet
maltiness
of
the
rest
of
the
blend
there
are
far
too
few
brews
that
are
so
well
bended
as
this
one
overall
a
good
reasonably
heavy
english
ale
it
does
seem
like
a
stronger
english
mild
ale
which
is
a
nice
change
i
would
have
expected
some
more
complexity
however
as
it
is
it
is
more
like
a
slightly
richer
newcastle
brown
which
is
much
cheaper
so
a
nice
beer
but
nowhere
near
worth
the
price
of
au100
a
case
of
12
x
500ml
o
a
really
good
english
strong
ale
o
sad
to
say
disappointed
overall
has
potential
especially
with
regards
to
the
scent
and
flavor
but
came

no

accentuated
with

sweet

and
nut
components
bitter
and
sweet
with
a
high
alcohol
feel
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
aged
3
5
years
in
the
cellar
a
very
traditional
beer
not
to
be
confused
with
a
barleywine
or
modernday
booze
bomb
no
roasty
bitterness
and
very
little
in
the
way
of
hops
just
lots
of
rich
chewy
malty
goodness
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
drink
and
at
6
its
relatively
promising
i
love
the
sweetness
its
like
a
dopplebock
but
has
an
entirely
different
set
of
parameters
i
have
a
suspiciousness
against
myself
for
wanting
to
award
another
set
of
strong
5s
in
two
beers
in
a
row
and
after
much
consideration
i
have
to
admit
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
and
i
have
no
2nd
thoughts
in
rating
this
very
highly
let
me
know
what
you
think
i
recommend
this
completely
and
will
purchase
a
few
more
tomorrow
to
affirm
what
i
feel
now
i
like
this
one
something
keeps
me
from
loving
it
i
think
its
the
agingjust
wonder
what
the
original
brew
is
like
overall
a
really
nice
beer
if
not
exactly
earthshattering
i
enjoy
the
added
depth
from
the
blending
of
woodaged
beer
but
it
is
just
missing
a
little
something
it
is
still
nicer
than
your
typical
english
ale
and
i
appreciate
that
it
is
not
skunked
despite
the
clear
bottle
food
match
christmas
fare
roast
turkey
honey
glazed
ham
sides
of
roast
potato
onion
squash
carrot
peas
and
a
heavy
gravy
all
are
viable
options
d
not
my
style
for
a
session
but
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
old
ale
literally
made
from
an
older
ale
and
a
newer
ale
just
like
in
the
old
days
fun
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
not
a
great
one
interesting
when
drunk
slowly
no
great
change
from
intial
serving
temp
to
nearly
room
temp
overall
very
complex
nicely
developed
malt
flavors
accompanied
by
beautiful
esters
its
very
balanced
yet
intriguing
o
quite
a
decent
old
ale
one
that
i
could
revisit
and
could
recommend
without
reservation
pours
a
clear
caramel
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
toffee
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
along
with
some
dark
fruit
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
very
rich
aromas
and
flavors
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
scent
is
a
normal
fruity
scent
not
too
overwhelming
the
taste
is
a
bit
like
boddingtons
if
you
havent
had
that
then
it
is
like
a
brown
with
some
sweetness
to
it
this
is
a
smooth
session
beer
that
would
be
good
in
a
pub
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
it
not
a
bad
old
ale
though
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
dull
the
aroma
opens
quite
nicely
and
the
flavor
begins
impressively
but
quickly
fades
to
a
dull
thin
and
somewhat
vapid
finish
i
would
love
to
taste
this
one
in
its
native
country
but
im
not
terribly
impressed
with
the
condition
i
find
it
in
here
this
was
a
real
quality
ale
to
drink
very
drinkable
with
good
depth
and
aromas
the
flavors
are
lacking
slightly
but
what
is
there
is
very
good
couldnt
resist
tryin
this
one
it
pours
a
very
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
ashen
foam
the
nose
comprises
flaky
biscuit
light
toffee
light
honey
light
vague
dark
fruits
and
a
touch
of
toasted
wood
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dark
greens
graham
crackers
light
cardboard
light
tobacco
tea
sweetgrass
and
a
vague
sense
of
cedar
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
overall
a
nice
brew
one
thats
clearly
benefited
from
the
oakaging
notes
reminds
me
of
yorkshire
stingo
a
little
this
is
a
tasty
malty
sipper
o
i
enjoy
this
example
much
more
than
my
last
review
perhaps
the
previous
one
was
not
wellkept
this
time
it
is
complex
and
very
enjoyable
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild

good

this
is
a

to
for

a

the
only
bad
thing
i
can
say
about
this
is
that
its
only
brewed
in
limited
qualities
my
expectations
were
shattered
with
this
english
ale
and
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
another
one
the
label
said
that
it
is
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
mature
english
cheese
but
i
can
tell
you
that
a
nice
simple
pizza
with
spinach
and
cheese
is
not
too
shabby
either
if
you
see
this
one
on
the
shelf
grab
it
and
enjoy
youll
thank
me
later
for
anyone
who
likes
to
explore
complex
malty
beers
this
one
will
captivate
you
but
you
have
to
wonder
what
the
12
percent
strong
beer
tasted
like
on
its
own
boursin
cheese
and
basilstuffed
chicken
breast
over
parmesan
risotto
is
a
very
appealing
pairing
not
bad
i
bet
it
would
be
even
better
fresh
and
on
tap
still
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
brewerys
output
kind
of
average
english
ale
lots
of
malt
and
light
hops
good
though
pours
a
brilliant
ruby
color
with
a
minimal
fizzy
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
along
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
fruits
raisins
and
maltiness
some
aged
oak
and
toffee
are
noted
as
well
the
taste
is
smooth
and
delicious
has
sharp
malts
raisins
and
a
slight
alocholic
bite
that
finishes
off
the
quaff
mouthfeel
is
crispy
and
drinkablity
is
pretty
solid
i
think
this
could
survive
another
year
or
so
in
the
cellar
to
settle
down
some
of
the
bite
but
overall
a
great
beer
hmmm
fix
that
very
bitter
aftertaste
either
the
hops
were
used
incorrectly
or
the
clear
bottle
has
something
to
do
with
it
otherwise
it
is
delightful
ale
the
lower
abv
is
a
bit
refreshing
for
the
style
makes
it
easier
to
drink
in
the
500ml
quantity
still
it
could
have
been
rounded
out
with
more
malt
and
honestly
id
do
away
with
the
label
proudly
advertising
caramel
color
added
d
smooth
fairly
mild
and
very
agreeable
with
a
low
alchohol
content
for
the
style
fantastically
drinkable
this
beer
strikes
a
perfect
balance
between
bold
flavors
and
drinkability
the
beer
dork
in
me
says
im
drinking
a
big
aged
sophisticated
beer
and
the
responsible
worker
drone
in
me
says
im
drinking
a
beer
that
wont
kill
me
tomorrow
if
i
have
a
couple
its
a
damn
shame
its
not
easier
to
find
if
you
have
a
store
near
you
that
carries
it
i
strongly
recommend
picking
some
up
i
should
add
that
i
poured
mine
too
cold
and
it
warmed
up
as
i
drank
and
i
enjoyed
it
across
the
entire
range
i
recommend
drinking
colder
than
some
of
you
normally
drink
an
old
ale
definitely
no
warmer
than
55
in
my
opinion
d
a
great
sipper
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
the
english
old
ale
and
at
an
affordable
price
a
truly
unexpected
surprise
a
great
sipping
beer
with
more
complexity
than
many
beers
with
50
more
alcohol
this
grand
old
ale
is
a
classic
example
that
beer
can
be
many
things
in
this
case
a
drink
that
can
be
appreciated
in
a
slowly
sipped
pint
or
in
a
brandy
snifter
with
some
vintage
cheese
a
lovely
beer
whose
complexity
belies
its
strength
olde
suffolk
poured
a
very
dark
amberbrown
color
with
almost
no
head
but
showed
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
full
of
brown
sugar
hints
of
milk
chocolate
the
taste
was
like
raspberries
and
milk
chocolate
together
very
nice
flavor
mouthfeel
was
good
and
for
the
style
the
drinkability
was
good
as
well
overall
this
beer
was
very
nice
old
ales
tent
to
be
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
was
one
that
i
enjoyed
i
would
buy
this
again
i
am
impressed
and
will
try
it
again
a
richer
body
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
at
times
it
seems
water
especially
considering
the
robust
flavours
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
oaky
wood
and
even
a
touch
of
sherry
sweetness
chalky
minerals
find
their
way
into
the
flavor
as
do
some
of
the
darker
fruits
has
most
of
the
pretty
typical
flavors
found
in
an
english
ale
but
what
is
so
surprising
about
olde
suffolk
is
the
incredible
smoothness
of
the
beer
it
just
goes
down
soooo
easy
tasty
stuff
d
only
6
makes
this
a
remarkably
easy
drinker
pleasant
flavors
and
a
seductive
aroma
definitely
earn
this
a
spot
of
my
must
repeat
list
recommended
id
love
to
try
this
on
cask
d
well
done
this
beer
has
a
fairly
complex
and
sophisticated
flavor
profile
that
ends
up
going
down
easy
although
i
prefer
to
savor
it
a
bit
slower
than
my
average
beer
since
its
not
every
day
i
try
a
beer
like
this
recommended
unless
youre
exclusively
a
hophead
pours
mahogany
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
has
fruity
malts
spicy
yeast
toffee
oak
vanilla
and
caramel
taste
has
bready
malts
dark
fruits
cloves
and
oak
medium
body
has
a
clean
carbonation
not
bad
could
use
either
a
bit
more
depth
or
a
few
years
of
age
to
develop
overall
great
drinkability
very
nice
flavors
sweet
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
and
oak
flavors
are
all
very
well
balanced
it
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
and
there
is
a
small
metallic
flavor
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
great
beer
wonderful
character
throughout
sidenote
while
i
enjoy
most
english
brews
at
cellar
temperature
or
warmer
in
the
case
of
some
barleywines
and
old
ales
this
one
was
definitely
better
a
few
degrees
cooler
than
cellar
temperature
imo
the
complexities
were
actually
a
bit
more
apparent
slightly
cooler
and
the
alcoholvanilla
oak
notes
were
slightly
more
aggressive
as
the
beer
warms
with
the
good
and
rich
flavor
along
with
refreshing
crispness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoying
beer
to
consume
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
balanced
taste
i
definitely
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
during
a
night
the
taste
is
definitely
caramel
some
slightly
boozy
aged
vat
bourbon
notes
coming
through
there
is
plenty
of
old
fashioned
toffee
and
caramel
and
butterscotch
flavors
there
is
a
slight
bite
in
the
finish
but
the
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
a
slightly
boozy
caramel
butterscotch
and
uncarbonated
mix
of
things
the
beer
is
reasonably
complex
and
there
is
some
dextriny
sweetness
to
the
beer
but
it
is
the
boozy
old
fashioned
toffee
that
pretty
much
defines
the
beer
overall
a
decent
brew
however
this
is
best
enjoyed
when
your
full
attention
and
senses
can
be
given
to
this
beer
i
would
consider
this
as
great
choice
if
your
are
only
drinking
this
one
beer
in
a
sitting
try
other
aged
english
strong
ales
and
old
ales
before
proclaiming
this
beer
is
at
the
top
of
its
class
would
revisit
this
d
quite
drinkable
it
is
a
nice
beer
with
an
abv
that
isnt
too
high
the
beer
could
be
a
touch
less
cloying
though
d
for
the
abv
this
is
little
bit
of
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
richness
a
rather
boring
take
on
the
style
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
a
barrel
aged
old
ale
olde
suffolks
a
pretty
impressive
old
ale
the
aging
process
in
oak
barrels
had
a
positive
impace
thats
appreciable
in
all
respects
the
flavor
has
a
slight
buttery
taste
that
throws
it
just
a
little
its
doesnt
have
a
huge
negative
impact
but
does
hold
it
back
a
little
thats
the
only
small
qualm
i
have
with
it
impressive
all
around
nonetheless
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
nice
brew
well
balanced
very
smooth
it
has
an
oaky
character
that
doesnt
overpower
it
began
at
higher
end
of
cellar
temperature
yet
subtle
complexities
such
as
chocolate
arose
as
it
progressed
very
drinkable
a
nice
treat
from
across
the
pond
poured
from
bottle
at
cellar
temp
producing
a
dark
ruby
color
below
a
thick
light
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
for
much
of
the
session
there
is
a
full
malt
and
carmel
nose
that
isnt
at
all
overpowering
but
lends
a
good
compliment
to
each
taste
that
again
is
malt
with
sweet
carmel
toffee
and
later
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
slight
bitterness
a
dry
finish
and
overall
a
very
good
ale
with
nice
oak
notes
that
balance
the
flavors
and
pairs
well
with
a
cheese
plate
overall
not
quite
what
i
was
looking
for
thomas
hardys
is
far
superior
for
a
strong
english
ale
this
beer
is
astonishingly
reserved
it
makes
no
bid
for
your
attention
and
yet
youre
all
too
happy
to
give
it
it
acts
coy
and
indifferent
yet
everything
about
it
its
scent
its
colours
are
magnetizing
and
entrancing
it
is
spellbinding
you
become
so
fully
immersed
in
its
complexities
that
all
deliberations
become
focused
on
this
all
too
modest
but
deserving
ale
only
to
have
the
bottle
finish
before
you
really
feel
you
ever
got
to
know
it
d
exceptionally
drinkable
good
complexity
in
a
great
session
beer
interesting
how
its
made
too
a
blend
of
old
aged
2
years
in
oak
tuns
and
young
beer
a
decent
ale
indeed
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
that
i
loved
reviewing
it
a
stronger
english
ale
indeed
great
flavors
poured
a
super
ruby
red
color
with
the
entire
glass
being
coated
in
tiny
bubbles
the
one
finger
width
head
stuck
around
for
about
a
minute
the
aroma
is
woody
sweet
and
of
dark
fruit
there
was
also
a
very
pleasant
apple
scent
the
oak
flavor
from
the
barrels
is
very
noticeable
this
was
super
malty
and
sweet
with
a
nice
roastiness
to
it
not
much
hop
bitterness
here
but
thats
alright
there
is
barely
enough
the
feel
is
a
tad
thing
but
not
bad
this
is
a
very
drinkable
epaish
old
ale
nothing
super
special
like
i
was
hoping
but
solid
a
pleasant
complex
drinker
while
its
very
enjoyable
im
left
thinking
it
could
be
even
better
i
agree
with
the
reviewer
below
me
this
should
be
bottleconditioned
there
is
the
likely
difference
between
this
and
an
exceptional
old
ale
like
fullers
vintage
that
said
its
still
pretty
damned
good
very
drinkable
with
a
sense
of
refinement
and
depth
of
flavor
that
belie
the
low
abv
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
exudes
class
in
the
same
way
the
smell
of
old
leather
does
its
a
shame
this
one
isnt
bottleconditioned
as
that
could
really
be
the
final
leg
needed
to
elevate
this
into
a
whole
other
realm
very
good
brew
big
mouth
feel
strong
malt
flavors
whiskey
malt
a
very
tasty
british
ale
i
shouldnt
look
at
previous
reviews
as
it
may
bias
me
but
i
have
to
say
im
going
to
run
against
the
grain
on
this
one
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
d
the
only
thing
that
could
make
this
better
is
if
they
brewed
it
with
some
chocolate
malt
really
very
nice
much
better
than
the
speckled
hen
mahogany
pour
with
nearly
no
head
earthy
malty
oak
aroma
that
is
very
sweet
velvety
mouthfeel
smooth
taste
of
caramel
malt
and
some
vanilla
mellowness
from
the
oak
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
nicely
balanced
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
an
extremely
muddy
dark
brown
with
just
a
slight
light
brown
head
that
disappeared
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
toffee
caramel
vanilla
and
oak
the
flavor
has
a
big
toffee
component
but
there
is
also
just
a
slight
tart
funk
to
it
vanilla
and
caramel
are
both
there
also
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
just
a
slight
carbonation
to
it
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
style
that
i
would
like
to
delve
into
just
a
little
more
light
sweetness
with
oak
and
toffee
that
tastes
more
nutty
than
fruity
like
the
smell
some
nice
tannins
in
there
that
add
to
the
flavor
but
step
down
the
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
fine
the
alcohol
not
to
noticeable
for
an
old
ale
overall
its
very
tasty
and
easily
consumed
i
would
definetely
enjoy
this
one
again
in
the
future
overall
impressions
not
a
great
big
fan
the
raisins
really
chase
me
away
from
this
beer
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
then
give
it
a
try
rating
this
beer
higher
than
i
enjoyed
it
for
the
complexity
of
the
taste
drinkability
is
fairly
good
although
it
somehow
tastes
and
feels
stronger
on
the
alcohol
than
one
would
expect
for
4
5
abv
i
was
really
surprised
by
the
flavor
on
this
one
especially
after
tasting
my
friends
disgusting
greene
king
ipa
made
by
the
same
brewers
lots
of
dark
fruits
like
plum
currant
and
apple
with
a
big
malty
backbone
that
delivered
notes
of
sweet
sugary
caramel
and
butterscotch
the
alcohol
couldve
used
a
bit
more
oomph
however
but
the
2
yr
oak
aging
threw
in
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
the
finish
id
definately
have
this
again
and
probably
will
have
another
bottle
on
this
trip
overall
a
nice
old
ale
that
improves
as
it
warms
i
debated
for
some
time
in
the
store
if
i
should
purchase
a
bottle
of
this
or
not
im
glad
that
i
decided
to
pours
a
dark
red
almost
purple
with
a
decent
head
and
good
lacing
i
let
the
beer
warm
up
in
the
glass
for
a
bit
the
aroma
is
very
fragrant
feels
smooth
going
down
and
finishes
even
smoother
very
drinkable
indeed
and
the
flavor
is
nothing
short
of
spectacular
the
blend
of
two
ales
must
be
the
key
with
this
one
cause
there
is
a
fresh
hoppy
taste
followed
directly
by
a
strong
smooth
burst
almost
finishes
like
a
whiskey
or
a
dry
wine
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
works
well
this
beer
is
a
bit
pricey
for
my
liking
but
it
worth
every
penny
to
enjoy
once
in
a
while
this
beer
pours
a
sheer
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
molasses
milk
chocolate
and
hints
of
wood
the
taste
is
of
caramel
nuts
and
tannins
it
is
rather
weak
when
compared
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
weird
review
i
expected
to
like
this
quite
a
bit
more
but
i
have
to
say
i
was
dissapointed
just
ok
to
me
lets
set
sail
good
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
this
the
taste
is
similar
rich
complex
yet
fairly
subtle
theres
a
clear
light
bitterness
up
front
and
in
the
finish
more
mellow
in
the
middle
the
palate
is
full
and
complex
and
lively
its
easy
to
drink
complex
and
very
flavourful
this
is
a
tasty
brew
from
greene
king
i
was
just
over
in
london
recently
and
had
one
of
their
abbot
ales
and
liked
it
so
i
thought
id
try
their
old
ale
very
tasty
indeed
nice
dark
brown
body
with
a
decent
tannish
head
nice
malty
scent
and
flavor
its
right
in
between
a
bitter
and
a
stout
with
the
notion
of
a
brown
not
far
off
delicious
from
first
to
last
sip
d
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
a
very
good
old
ale
nice
and
thick
and
so
smooth
the
carbonation
level
is
spot
on
and
it
leaves
a
nice
coating
around
the
mouth
drinkability
is
also
good
goes
down
easy
for
being
rather
heavy
drinkability
is
great
this
brew
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
the
sourness
from
the
aroma
does
not
show
on
the
palate
and
the
clean
finish
is
rare
among
brews
with
dark
malt
complexity
cheers
d
this
old
ale
is
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
at
all
and
it
didnt
weigh
me
down
despite
the
richness
of
it
all
also
with
such
complexity
there
is
always
something
to
be
appreciated
much
like
the
war
requiem
this
is
a
serious
heavy
sipper
perhaps
a
bit
more
hop
or
yeast
spice
might
make
this
brew
even
more
interesting
but
its
just
fine
as
is
not
bad
at
all
worth
a
shot
overall
a
luxurious
and
thick
chewy
beer
plenty
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
finishing
with
a
slightly
sour
and
bitter
malty
blast
the
alcohol
is
almost
an
afterthought
well
hidden
but
present
if
searched
for
pours
dark
tealike
brown
thin
head
leaving
just
a
thin
ring
aroma
is
strong
mail
and
caramel
flavor
has
roasted
malts
oak
caramel
along
with
some
dark
fruits
good
robust
flavor
has
some
hints
of
sherry
flavors
i
assume
from
the
oak
aged
ale
blended
in
this
is
one
of
the
beers
we
tend
to
keep
on
hand
all
the
time
ruby
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
had
pretty
good
retention
and
lace
nose
is
oaky
caramelly
and
yes
fruitcakey
taste
is
the
same
with
some
roasty
flavors
burnt
toffee
and
a
faint
hop
presence
lighter
side
of
full
bodied
nice
and
silky
id
like
another
please
d
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
and
would
not
feel
obliged
to
limit
my
intake
to
one
drinkability
this
brew
is
amazing
and
i
will
be
looking
for
another
bottle
asap
purchased
last
year
at
the
lcbo
nothing
spectacular
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
less
overpowering
than
some
of
the
other
older
ales
ive
had
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
flavours
all
the
way
through
with
a
decently
thick
mouthfeel
and
bready
aftertaste
hints
of
wood
in
there
as
well
although
very
little
of
the
vanilla
flavour
you
usually
get
from
oak
this
was
oak
aged
right
d
i
like
and
recommend
as
it
commands
attention
when
drinking
each
sip
or
gulp
seems
new
and
different
to
the
mouth
this
is
like
drinking
an
entire
song
instead
of
some
drinks
that
have
just
a
few
notes
to
offer
i
would
like
to
send
a
night
with
a
number
of
bottles
of
this
a
good
dinner
and
friends
and
family
tastes
of
oak
caramel
tart
and
a
dry
lingering
finish
a
great
old
ale
one
i
would
not
pass
up
drinkability
a
complex
and
satsifying
brew
that
works
the
diacetyl
in
to
its
advantage
taste
is
tart
at
first
without
being
sour
the
complex
smells
are
a
bit
muted
in
the
taste
but
still
the
taste
is
full
of
different
tastes
dark
overripe
apples
wet
soil
wood
a
spiciness
which
reminds
me
of
christmas
alcohol
is
a
little
hot
and
there
is
a
slight
trace
of
oxidation
in
the
beer
very
nice
rubygarnet
color
smallish
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
fruitcake
spice
and
caramel
flavor
can
be
described
with
burnt
toffee
slight
oak
finish
and
some
raisin
mouthfeel
is
slick
lightmedium
body
carbonation
on
the
light
side
but
expected
in
the
style
drinkability
is
decent
might
be
the
best
beer
i
can
readily
purchase
in
hk
so
id
better
get
used
to
it
an
interesting
beer
it
is
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
still
a
touch
more
simplistic
than
i
could
wish
for
i
wonder
if
this
beer
was
heavily
filtered
before
being
bottled
it
seems
a
little
stripped
of
flavor
and
complexity
somehow
despite
all
my
gutfeeling
hesitations
about
this
beer
i
am
really
enjoying
it
i
think
that
this
is
because
there
is
still
quite
a
breadth
of
flavor
here
despite
the
guessed
at
filtration
sure
i
think
this
could
be
a
lot
better
and
more
complex
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
make
it
work
despite
that
the
individual
components
dont
quite
cut
it
on
their
own
d
drinkability
is
ok
there
ares
some
gaps
in
this
beer
would
have
liked
a
more
sweet
malty
character
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
this
full
flavored
beer
has
a
nice
strong
aroma
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
however
its
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
and
theres
hardly
any
head
or
lace
definitely
worth
a
try
grab
a
bottle
if
you
can
this
had
a
bit
of
promise
but
its
boring
overall
plus
the
acidity
is
too
high
oh
well
notes
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
and
would
also
put
in
some
effort
to
seek
this
out
the
character
from
the
oak
aged
brew
that
is
then
blended
work
out
very
well
it
has
enough
livelyness
to
keep
this
old
dog
learning
new
tricks
pours
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
little
fizzy
head
basically
no
sticky
lacing
at
all
the
nose
is
malty
slight
touch
of
pears
and
carameltoffee
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
malty
and
lots
of
carameltoffee
lightmedium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
at
that
recommended
the
smell
is
god
awful
like
bad
wine
and
the
taste
is
horrible
how
does
this
beer
have
such
good
marks
its
truly
terrible
but
it
just
shows
you
how
different
some
people
can
think
and
brew
it
first
tastes
bitter
sweet
then
starts
to
sharpen
as
it
warms
its
aftertaste
tastes
like
wine
when
you
breath
out
the
nose
but
alot
of
people
like
that
bite
to
there
brew
but
not
me
really
i
did
a
rerate
twice
this
beer
is
well
crap
i
hate
it
to
damn
tart
and
sour
and
geez
tastes
like
a
beer
that
went
bad
a
wine
beer
if
u
will
overall
very
well
done
old
ale
dont
see
enough
of
this
style
in
the
us
complex
without
being
messy
intense
yet
still
balanced
this
is
a
quality
beer
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
not
what
i
was
hoping
i
probably
will
not
purchase
this
beer
again
its
drinkable
but
then
again
so
is
water
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
red
tint
aroma
was
a
little
faint
but
what
was
there
was
a
pleasant
malty
dark
fruit
mostly
grapes
and
cherries
flavor
was
more
of
the
dark
fruit
and
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
and
a
bit
tangy
as
the
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
became
a
little
more
noticeable
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
which
all
led
to
a
smooth
warming
finish
cheers
tasty
solid
brew
with
some
cheese
and
bread
this
would
make
a
great
meal
green
king
get
a
lot
of
stick
from
some
of
british
real
ale
drinkers
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
they
should
be
applauded
for
producing
it
i
think
i
will
have
another
this
style
is
a
holdover
from
the
days
when
beer
was
aged
in
wood
for
up
to
and
over
a
year
olde
suffolk
is
a
prime
tasty
example
worthy
of
recommendation
mouthfeel
is
very
good
filling
the
mouth
but
not
too
much
so
and
a
crisp
finish
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
will
keep
this
one
in
mind
when
i
was
a
solid
old
ale
recommended
this
poured
rather
flat
not
much
head
to
speak
of
wonderful
aroma
fruity
and
a
hint
of
tea
aroma
as
well
taste
is
interesting
some
tea
flavor
here
but
just
as
aroma
some
ghostlike
fruits
in
the
back
ground
actually
a
very
bold
flavor
hard
to
describe
but
pleasant
well
balanced
hop
bitterness
with
a
nice
touch
of
malt
but
leaning
towards
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
satisfying
drinkability
is
fine
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
i
will
certainly
have
again
appeared
a
bronzy
amber
color
with
a
soda
pop
colored
head
and
nice
bubbles
dancing
up
the
glass
aromas
of
toffee
molasses
and
candy
corn
solidly
fill
the
nose
the
taste
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
corn
mixed
with
a
mild
sourness
make
for
quite
an
exquisite
flavor
very
delicious
the
flavors
just
play
on
the
tongue
and
its
very
memorable
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
on
the
tad
dry
side
i
can
drink
this
then
have
another
one
i
picture
myself
reading
a
book
by
the
fireplace
just
widdling
the
time
away
with
a
constant
pints
of
this
very
tasty
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
easy
to
drink
and
fun
to
savor
goes
very
well
with
tangy
foods
like
pickles
or
olives
deep
red
color
with
nary
a
head
to
be
found
smells
of
dark
cherries
plums
taste
is
slightly
acidic
with
a
big
dark
cherry
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
drying
slightly
charred
flavor
somewhat
tangy
in
nature
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
but
doesnt
detract
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
a
pretty
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
good
body
and
easy
to
drink
not
an
excellent
old
ale
but
an
all
around
decent
one
overall
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
seem
to
be
opposites
one
another
but
combine
to
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
ale
light
to
medium
light
in
body
very
good
drinking
at
a
slow
to
moderate
pace
although
if
your
the
type
to
throw
it
back
fast
it
wont
kick
but
that
just
aint
right
d
blending
the
old
ale
with
some
fresh
brew
has
made
this
quite
drinkable
i
could
session
this
but
id
be
in
trouble
pours
a
clear
brown
some
red
in
the
edges
thick
off
white
head
some
spots
of
lace
nice
retention
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
some
iron
and
minerals
dark
fruits
alcohol
not
bad
taste
is
sweet
some
toffee
dark
fruits
really
malty
and
coating
brown
sugar
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
almost
thick
nice
coating
decent
sipper
this
really
is
a
beautiful
beer
with
its
deep
amber
hues
and
dense
mousey
head
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
yields
strong
doses
of
caramel
and
oaky
vanilla
but
mostly
a
very
powerful
citrus
the
tast
is
really
complex
for
the
most
part
a
sour
citrusy
taste
dominates
with
oak
in
the
background
from
start
to
finish
with
flashes
of
many
other
elements
such
as
caramel
grain
vanilla
and
dried
fruit
not
sure
if
i
cought
it
all
as
it
seems
with
every
sip
i
catch
something
else
in
a
flash
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
what
i
would
expect
with
a
beer
of
this
compexity
but
i
like
the
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
have
to
put
the
drinkability
just
a
little
above
average
because
while
its
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
that
i
would
have
again
if
offered
the
sour
citric
quality
leaves
an
odd
character
to
it
that
for
just
doesnt
quite
meld
well
with
the
other
flavors
definitely
worth
a
try
though
as
i
can
see
how
someone
else
might
rate
this
one
much
higher
than
i
have
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
d
very
tasty
i
like
this
a
lot
bottle
poured
a
dark
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
semisweet
malt
with
some
light
oak
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
caramelized
malt
with
some
very
subtle
notes
of
oak
and
fruit
body
is
way
too
light
and
carbonation
is
low
which
is
to
be
expected
of
i
have
to
admit
that
this
one
was
a
bit
deceiving
and
definitely
lacking
in
complexity
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
red
with
a
lush
tan
head
lots
of
complex
flavour
experience
here
in
fact
its
hard
to
pin
down
as
the
taste
goes
through
various
transformations
that
im
just
not
expert
enough
to
characterize
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
tastes
like
quality
full
bodied
sayeth
the
label
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
though
with
spicey
aftertaste
im
at
a
loss
for
descriptors
but
you
should
try
it
if
you
like
complexity
in
your
beer
this
one
will
do
it
and
it
goes
down
like
a
river
of
melted
butterscotch
with
hops
medium
body
and
relatively
lightly
carbonated
this
beer
has
something
for
everyone
on
one
hand
you
have
a
rich
flavorful
brown
ale
on
the
other
is
a
refreshing
acidity
either
inspired
by
or
the
inspiration
for
flemish
browns
this
isnt
an
oak
bomb
by
any
means
but
it
has
a
very
definite
oak
flavor
tastey
and
complex
worth
a
try
three
thumbs
up
on
this
awsome
mellow
smooth
blended
ale
wish
i
could
taste
this
one
unpasturized
lcbo
advanced
tasting
this
pours
a
faintly
carbonated
copper
liquid
with
just
a
petit
amount
of
beige
dusting
nice
malt
based
aromatoasty
roasted
malts
bready
with
woody
nutty
burnt
sugars
flavours
are
a
wonderfully
balanced
interpretation
of
the
aromas
lots
of
vanillawood
with
sweet
nutty
malts
toasty
with
a
smidge
of
the
abv
shining
through
very
warming
and
dangerously
drinkable
finishes
with
a
big
malt
bang
and
a
wonderful
warmth
pored
this
into
a
16
oz
tumbler
with
a
wide
top
whew
this
brew
really
has
a
smell
that
is
like
whiskey
taste
was
strong
and
when
you
exhale
that
oakwhiskey
smell
was
very
evident
was
a
decent
different
brew
but
most
likely
will
not
buy
one
again
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
red
in
the
light
the
thin
white
head
dissipates
quite
quickly
but
the
ale
is
obviously
quite
lively
aroma
of
walnuts
and
bit
of
oak
and
some
malt
as
well
lots
of
caramel
appears
as
is
warms
and
dark
wood
taste
was
very
complex
sweet
peppery
sappy
some
piney
hops
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
spitzy
tastes
like
they
used
hard
water
to
brew
this
is
very
complex
and
takes
some
time
to
finish
which
is
great
lovely
malty
chocolate
toffee
and
sweet
dried
fruit
aromas
to
taste
similar
initial
flavours
alcohol
noticeable
but
it
has
such
a
beautiful
long
lasting
bitter
finish
that
goes
on
and
on
overall
everything
comes
together
in
this
excellent
english
ale
which
id
be
happy
to
drink
all
day
long
complex
and
robust
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
although
a
bit
expensive
but
that
comes
with
the
territory
be
sure
to
enjoy
this
one
this
is
a
solid
old
ale
not
quite
on
a
par
with
the
best
like
th
or
engine
oil
but
good
in
and
of
itself
give
it
a
go
d
bit
to
watery
and
laid
back
for
me
i
like
stronger
flavors
and
this
was
lacking
that
quite
a
bit
beautiful
garnet
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
with
some
urging
nose
is
reticent
deep
malt
is
obvious
but
its
very
stingy
here
smells
a
tad
sour
and
dusty
taste
however
is
exceptional
bits
of
dark
fruit
here
and
there
more
than
a
touch
of
sourness
hints
of
vanilla
oak
some
acidity
cocoa
powder
and
mild
earthy
tealike
hops
drying
it
out
good
mineral
aspect
and
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
full
with
soft
low
carbonation
very
creamy
very
drinkable
too
either
its
way
past
due
or
is
just
plain
mediocre
beer
and
im
inclined
to
think
its
the
latter
good
example
of
an
import
in
a
pretty
bottle
that
isnt
worth
my
time
or
money
quite
an
unusal
beer
drank
it
as
a
part
of
a
beer
tasting
flight
the
others
in
attendance
were
uncertain
some
liked
some
not
so
its
overall
score
was
3
4
from
6
tasters
this
is
one
beer
that
makes
me
proud
to
be
a
beer
advocate
a
must
try
drinkability
oh
my
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
so
very
smooth
so
clearly
representing
what
an
english
ale
should
be
except
for
the
price
i
would
often
say
pass
me
another
poured
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
half
inch
offwhitekhaki
head
which
dissipated
soon
after
the
first
sip
and
left
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
complex
albiet
not
very
strong
with
notes
of
caramelchocolate
malts
and
an
almost
berrylike
fruit
aroma
that
reminded
me
of
red
wine
specifically
some
cabernet
cavingions
ive
had
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
stand
out
again
firstly
and
a
berrygrape
taste
follows
ending
with
a
dry
finish
there
are
a
lot
of
flavours
going
on
but
they
all
seem
a
little
subdued
however
this
didnt
hamper
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
it
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
so
it
actually
feels
very
light
would
definately
drink
this
again
i
was
impressed
by
the
age
stuff
so
i
was
wondering
if
this
one
was
something
like
a
blurred
porto
wine
jerez
or
something
like
that
no
its
a
dark
beer
with
strong
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
body
nice
concentration
of
malt
smell
and
taste
but
nothing
soooo
special
its
a
good
beer
good
good
good
but
thats
all
it
works
as
an
ordinary
black
ale
crafted
far
away
from
the
barrels
very
well
done
exceptional
drinkability
worth
the
effort
to
find
and
try
this
fine
old
ale
didnt
quite
know
what
to
make
of
this
one
its
colour
smell
and
taste
were
all
totally
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
it
poured
a
crystal
clear
dark
reddish
brown
colour
the
head
was
khaki
in
colour
and
approximately
4mm
thick
it
subsided
to
nothing
in
less
than
45
seconds
the
smell
was
very
interesting
and
also
unexpected
very
winelike
it
actually
had
a
fruity
grape
smell
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
roasted
malt
in
the
background
clearly
identifiable
but
the
wine
grape
alcohol
smell
was
easily
noticeable
and
right
up
front
peculiar
the
taste
was
reminiscent
of
wine
as
well
malty
for
but
a
moment
when
you
take
a
sip
then
turning
tart
and
very
wine
like
odd
indeed
as
i
have
never
had
an
ale
with
these
characteristics
though
i
have
read
of
them
mouthfeel
seemed
light
and
was
much
more
carbonated
than
i
was
expecting
i
didnt
think
this
was
awful
but
i
certainly
wasnt
impressed
very
peculiar
brew
pours
a
very
dark
red
which
has
been
typical
of
most
of
the
old
ales
ive
tried
brandyish
scent
is
very
heavy
in
the
smell
taste
doesnt
overhwelm
but
hints
of
brandy
and
raisins
are
easily
detectable
much
more
drinkable
than
my
other
favorite
old
ale
thomas
hardy
not
quite
a
session
beer
of
course
but
if
youre
looking
to
have
12
beers
one
night
this
is
definitely
recommended
an
allaround
solid
old
ale
thats
easy
to
find
not
entirely
successful
but
worth
a
try
taste
theress
chocolate
covered
cherries
caramel
malts
and
dried
figs
the
oakiness
is
really
blended
well
and
doesnt
become
overpowering
a
bit
of
a
sourness
comes
out
as
this
gets
warmer
along
with
some
vinous
qualities
and
a
little
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
a
very
nice
relaxing
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
this
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
would
be
good
if
i
was
able
to
get
a
fresh
batch
but
i
dont
think
it
survived
the
trip
over
very
well
overall
i
remember
my
last
bottle
bottleconditioned
as
i
remember
it
being
much
richer
on
the
palate
but
that
was
four
years
ago
im
not
sure
if
the
recipe
has
been
changed
but
the
beer
as
it
is
now
is
quite
drinkable
and
thirstquenching
even
but
why
has
it
been
changed
to
the
pasteurisedfiltered
version
or
is
my
memory
a
bit
too
hazy
to
get
this
fact
right
but
overall
this
is
a
nice
complex
brew
that
has
a
lot
going
on
in
it
from
a
bottle
shared
at
the
march
michiana
coalition
of
the
drinking
meeting
dark
very
little
head
dark
amber
colored
has
a
caramel
woody
odor
malty
flavor
that
is
syrupy
and
sweet
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
flavor
is
very
strong
i
can
see
drinking
this
but
its
really
unlike
anything
else
i
see
in
the
u
s
1998
vintage
clear
rubymahogany
with
a
short
tan
head
that
reduced
to
a
thin
wisp
of
bubbles
some
lace
there
was
a
light
vinoussherry
aroma
that
melded
nicely
with
ripedried
fruit
and
a
hint
of
oakiness
complex
fruit
and
woody
flavour
with
a
light
tartness
hint
of
cherry
and
a
bit
of
chocolatetoffee
in
the
finish
medium
body
low
carbonation
smooth
and
slightly
drying
very
tasty
this
beer
has
aged
well
and
the
bottle
i
shared
was
in
excellent
shape
44
5444
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
very
nice
strong
old
ale
while
this
reminds
me
of
the
traquair
beers
oakfermented
though
pasteurized
it
also
has
a
lot
of
similarity
to
the
flemish
reds
without
the
sourness
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
any
of
the
above
the
bottle
indicates
that
this
is
a
blend
of
two
ales
that
have
been
aged
in
oak
for
two
years
this
beer
pours
from
a
brown
bottle
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
being
evident
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
malty
and
vinous
taste
is
definitely
vinous
to
some
extent
malt
is
a
strong
part
of
the
taste
notes
of
oak
are
also
apparent
this
is
the
second
one
ive
had
i
liked
it
more
the
first
time
they
were
labeled
differently
this
is
a
review
of
olde
suffolk
last
time
i
had
the
strong
suffolk
im
not
sure
if
there
is
any
difference
between
the
two
or
if
any
differences
could
be
attributed
to
how
the
beer
was
cared
for
or
just
my
mood
definitely
an
interesting
beer
i
doubt
this
will
be
the
last
time
i
try
it
overall
a
very
good
beer
recommended
probably
a
little
better
than
i
expected
pours
a
heavy
dark
brown
color
with
a
fair
head
that
fell
to
a
trace
though
laced
well
rich
malt
aroma
with
light
roasted
toasted
character
tastes
as
malty
as
the
aroma
suggests
big
sweetness
with
a
faint
sweet
alcohol
flavor
the
periphreals
are
decorated
with
coffee
cocoa
stoutlike
flavor
and
bitterness
moderately
full
and
heavy
to
the
mouth
respective
to
style
sweet
with
a
mild
relief
with
the
roasted
bitterness
finishes
full
and
savory
but
without
the
syrupy
thickness
and
aged
characteristics
normally
found
in
old
ales
overall
this
is
robust
and
interesting
brew
i
enjoy
the
character
more
as
it
warms
it
is
mild
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
i
would
recommend
this
one
very
full
complex
but
well
balanced
and
mellow
flavor
this
will
go
well
with
a
variety
of
food
but
deserves
to
be
appreciated
by
itself
marvelous
this
beer
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
it
poured
nice
and
dark
with
a
good
head
the
smell
was
pleasing
the
taste
was
the
best
part
on
taking
a
mouthful
it
covered
all
of
the
tastes
perfectly
in
my
opinion
slight
coffee
flavor
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
do
so
it
will
not
let
you
down
a
clean
dark
chestnut
brown
beer
with
some
mahogony
highlights
has
a
nice
creamy
dark
beige
head
with
just
a
little
bit
of
lace
there
is
a
nutty
sweet
malt
aroma
followed
by
an
intrigueing
oak
note
malty
sweet
down
the
middle
of
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
down
the
sides
good
mouthfeel
and
a
satisfiying
finish
wonderful
beer
one
of
the
things
i
love
i
love
about
it
is
that
the
finishing
bitterness
is
so
subtle
as
not
to
totally
and
abrasively
balance
the
malts
out
rather
the
flavors
flowed
from
sweet
to
mildly
bitter
fantastic
despite
this
beers
high
ratings
i
am
not
feeling
it
lacks
complexity
especially
on
the
tongue
a
dark
ruby
tinted
beer
poured
out
with
very
little
head
and
no
active
carbonation
smells
a
little
sweet
and
alot
of
dark
fruit
dates
raisins
plums
and
mildly
oaky
and
peppery
tasted
of
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
caramel
and
dry
vanilla
though
flavours
are
not
pronounced
really
somewhat
mineral
or
metallic
notes
which
where
slightly
offputting
of
all
i
disliked
the
mouthfeel
most
there
was
some
carbonation
but
it
was
a
little
thin
i
would
have
liked
and
expected
a
bit
more
fullness
this
thing
was
easy
to
put
down
with
the
low
abv
and
its
relative
lack
of
complexity
though
warmth
brought
out
a
little
more
flavor
but
dont
know
that
id
seek
this
out
often
just
wasnt
alive
enough
for
my
tastes
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
very
little
carbonation
and
a
tan
head
a
single
finger
head
quickly
setlles
down
to
barely
cover
the
surface
of
the
beer
rich
sweetness
in
aroma
but
rather
faint
and
hard
to
pick
up
very
smooth
not
too
heavy
with
some
smokiness
the
flavour
envelopes
the
entire
palate
as
you
sip
on
this
one
a
lot
of
character
with
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
as
it
warms
a
bit
overall
a
fantastic
old
ale
my
favourite
style
and
this
is
definately
one
to
seek
out
a
terribly
enjoyable
brew
cheers2beers
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
great
changeup
from
the
usual
drinkability
and
overall
a
nice
robust
old
ale
from
england
a
very
good
complex
yet
balanced
beer
that
i
wont
soon
forget
highly
recommended
as
its
such
an
authentic
old
ale
mmmm
drinkability
and
notes

certainly
not
a
chugging
beer
but
for
a
full
malty
complex
beer
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
big
beer
flavor
but
much
less
alcohol
than
i
am
used
to
in
old
ales
im
sorry
i
cant
get
this
around
me
notes
i
review
old
suffolk
vintage
ale
here
nothing
very
special
just
very
good
all
around
english
ale
age
has
taken
away
some
of
its
complexities
and
dulled
the
pallet
this
is
has
been
down
in
the
cellar
a
couple
of
years
and
it
looks
like
tawny
bootpolish
with
a
slight
haze
the
nose
is
all
old
fruit
and
old
hops
with
a
iron
undertone
the
taste
is
complex
as
hell
with
tobacco
dried
fruit
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
a
pleasant
metallic
twang
sits
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
with
the
finish
this
is
much
like
a
brown
from
belgium
in
its
continual
ability
to
challenge
and
delight
the
senses
opinion
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
british
ales
arent
my
favorite
styles
of
beers
but
this
is
one
that
stands
out
among
the
rest
it
has
a
bold
flavor
but
ends
up
finishing
pretty
balanced
and
refreshing
i
would
definitely
say
that
even
if
you
are
like
myself
when
it
comes
to
british
beers
that
you
should
give
this
beer
a
day
in
court
dark
brown
with
ruby

my
only
knock
on
this

that
it

be
a

the

wet

taste
is
a

sweet
but
has
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
although
it
feels
a
bit
off
on
the
balance
and
mouthfeel
to
me
funk
on
the
finish
which
would
seem
out

pretty

very

highly
recommended
for
the
malt
lover
or
those
searching
for
the
antihop
beer
kind
of
a
complex
beer
i
like
it
just
dint
feel
the
oak
well
seeing
the
other
scores
here
i
think
it
might
be
worthwhile
to
find
this
one
on
tap
i
always
used
to
think
that
old
ales
were
thick
robust
and
complex
but
this
beer
is
demonstrating
a
completely
different
take
i
dont
know
if
thats
good
or
bad
i
only
know
that
i
prefer
what
i
used
to
think
what
an
old
ale
was
o
an
alright
beer
not
the
worst
ive
had
will
not
seek
out
again
o
not
the
best
of
offering
from
morland
but
its
a
fair
beer
im
still
not
a
fan
of
the
clear
bottle
and
i
have
to
wonder
if
that
affects
the
taste
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
and
see
if
there
was
a
difference
indeed
if
rhett
butler
wanted
to
find
somewhere
there
was
left
in
life
charm
and
grace
he
should
have
settled
in
suffolk
right
next
to
the
morland
brewery
old
crafty
hen
is
nothing
if
not
charming
and
graceful
english
old
ales
like
this
one
and
the
fullers
vintage
ale
which
it
strongly
resembles
teach
one
how
to
relax
properly
reflect
and
appreciate
life
o
this
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
even
though
the
abv
is
not
too
high
enjoyable
flavors
and
aromas
but
it
seems
a
little
bigger
than
it
is
final
grade
3
71
a
b
grade
old
crafty
hen
is
a
tasty
strong
english
ale
though
old
ale
probably
wouldnt
have
been
my
first
guess
on
a
blind
tasting
style
aside
fans
of
innis
gunn
will
probably
appreciate
this
one
as
it
offers
a
somewhat
similar
flavour
profile
with
a
noticeably
more
varied
hop
presence
and
thus
better
balance
imo
a
great
beer
to
warm
your
bones
on
a
cold
winters
night
and
something
id
consider
getting
again
it
paired
nicely
with
some
beef
stew
overall
another
very
tasty
enjoyable
beer
from
this
brewer
lots
of
malty
flavour
and
some
nice
earthyfruity
flavours
to
go
with
it
id
pick
this
up
again
if
it
was
available
in
single
bottlecan
formats
locally
rjt
but
i
am
putting
up
with
these
authentic
old
school
ales
so
i
can
feel
more
a
part
of
the
all
creatures
great
and
small
world
i
am
visiting
through
tv
they
are
constantly
drinking
ales
like
this
o
a
nice
old
ale
with
emphasis
on
malt
nice
at
room
temp
o
a
really
nicely
executed
and
wonderfully
balanced
old
ale
while
old
crafty
hen
is
not
the
sort
of
lactic
oaky
old
ale
for
which
i
normally
reach
it
is
still
very
appealing
all
of
the
traits
of
old
speckled
hen
the
tanners
jack
and
hens
tooth
that
i
admire
seem
to
have
been
amplified
in
this
ale
i
could
see
this
beer
being
a
wonderful
introduction
to
the
world
of
traditional
english
old
ales
and
strong
ales
bottom
line
to
my
hen
house
experience
is
if
you
like
british
ale
and
have
a
chance
to
buy
the
fourpack
dont
pass
it
up
theyre
all
good
and
all
a
little
different
only
drawback
is
the
clear
bottles
risk
skunky
aromas
but
just
one
of
mine
even
suggested
that
overall
impression
for
a
beer
that
is
ranked
this
highly
on
beeradvocates
top
beers
in
britain
i
honestly
expected
more
it
is
a
little
too
light
in
body
and
malt
character
and
uses
obviously
american
hops
to
be
considered
an
english
ipa
when
compared
to
the
best
ameican
ipas
this
would
not
have
a
prayer
to
make
the
top
50
that
being
said
it
is
quite
refreshing
light
on
the
palate
and
thirst
quenching
interestingly
the
body
while
on
the
light
side
of
medium
has
a
powdery
touch
of
dryness
to
it
it
never
gets
too
slick
or
thin
and
displays
a
consistent
crispness
while
still
being
smooth
though
the
crispness
just
nips
o
has
some
certain
qualities
worth
savoring
increases
exponentially
in
enjoyability
as
it
goes
comes
of
like
an
enhanced
old
speckled
very
wellbalanced
aside
from
the
mild
alcyeast
bite
this
is
a
difficulttofind
brew
that
ive
been
hunting
for
3
or
4
years
i
am
happy
to
report
that
it
has
been
well
worth
the
hunt
and
the
wait
this
one
just
might
make
it
into
my
top10
list
overall
i
bought
this
in
a
4pack
with
three
other
old
hen
offerings
from
morland
based
on
my
good
opinion
of
old
speckled
hen
this
one
is
called
a
superior
fine
ale
on
the
bottle
and
by
comparison
to
osh
it
is
mainly
due
to
the
rich
maltiness
and
sweetness
both
of
which
i
am
a
fan
i
will
look
for
this
again
and
would
consider
it
something
of
a
special
occasion
beer
this
has
been
discussed
in
the
forums

but
im
surprised
that
theres
so
little
skunkiness
only
a
slight
skunky
aroma
as
these
beers
are
sold
in
clear
bottles
o
very
solid
brew
i
bought
a
fourpack
hen
house
sampler
from
the
brewery
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
four
taste
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
as
i
enjoy
the
bitter
but
a
great
beer
after
a
dinner
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
dessert
like
for
my
tastes
overall
excellent
example
of
a
strong
english
ale
recommended
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
body
with
a
brief
head
that
settles
to
a
white
collar
big
and
sweet
aromas
of
predominantly
toffee
followed
in
strength
by
dark
fruit
very
figlike
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
carries
a
big
toffee
and
biscuity
blast
on
the
front
and
midpalates
with
dark
fruit
figs
prunes
raisins
and
sherrylike
notes
emerging
on
the
mid
to
backpalates
a
lightly
earthy
wet
woodlike
bitterness
lends
some
balance
to
the
finish
as
far
as
old
ales
go
this
isnt
nearly
as
potent
as
some
of
the
american
bestsellers
but
its
relatively
mild
intensity
makes
it
potentially
more
appealing
to
a
broad
audience
while
the
austerity
of
flavor
profile
gives
the
geekier
beer
consumer
something
to
revel
in
overall
a
bit
disappointed
doesnt
seem
much
different
than
the
regular
old
speckled
hen
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
developed
a
nice
creamy
biscuit
colored
head
which
lasted
and
laced
reasonably
well
appearance
was
clear
amber
ruby
color
with
a
light
aroma
of

and

taste
had
notes
of
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
with
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
full

classic

ale
overall
i
like
the
style
and
i
like
the
taste
lots
of
character
and
easy
to
drink
a
few
in
succession
i
like
the
malitness
and
want
to
know
how
these
english
beers
get
this
particular
taste
which
no
one
else
seems
to
be
able
to
produce
the
closest
thing
to
them
are
the
german
commercial
caramely
beers
like
the
oktoberfests
but
these
have
totally
different
twists
which
i
really
enjoy
anybody
know
d
clear
glass
strikes
again
moreland
needs
to
fix
this
since
i
can
only
imagine
ever
getting
skunky
beers
from
them
in
the
us
the
scent
and
taste
were
not
pleasant
and
the
body
was
pretty
weak
the
finish
was
rough
so
it
was
not
easy
to
drink
in
any
regard
boo
fairly
sweet

pretty
malt
dominant
with
enough

from

pretty

going

is

full
on

english
old

not
a
big
and
brash
it
is
flavorful
in
an
english
subtle
way
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
pleasant
if
not
terribly
overwhelming
beer
there
is
definitely
a
bit
going
on
here
some
complexity
and
balance
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
someone
not

this
beer
has
a

carbonation
with
a
slightly

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
for
again
very
good
allaround
on
this

with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
was
also
warmly
malty
with
fruity
aspects
but
had
more
focus
on
raisins
and
dark
fruits
than
the
aroma
did
if
i
had
to
criticize
something
it
would
be
that
the
lightly
hopped
bitterness
comes
across
as
somewhat
murky
unfocused
and
nondescript
compared
to
the
sharply
focused
stellar
composition
of
the
malt
bill
has
a
rich
mouthfeel
without
being
heavy
in
texture
and
is
lightly
carbonated
finish
is
semidry
but
stubby
short
in
duration
its
not
really
a
bitter
but
kind
of
its
not
really
a
pale
ale
but
kind
of
not
so
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
bad
beer
just
different
not
sure
ive
had
an
old
ale
before
overall
this
is
wonderful
if
you
like
malty
beers
i
tend
to
love
english
ales
and
this
one
was
not
a
let
down
would
love
to
have
on
cask
sometime
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
but
has
some
interesting
flavors
that
make
it
pleasurable
to
sip

bottle
not
bad
quite
tasty
and
rounded
a
decent
enough
beer
although
it
seems
a
bit
bland
and
shallow
for
the
style
i
can
imagine
an
aged
ale
with
more
depth
and
intensity
would
probably
benefit
from
bottle
conditioning
still
the
woodyfruity
flavours
are
nice
worth
trying
i
had
a
2nd
bottle
the
next
day
at
cellar
temp
and
it
was
much
better
the
oak
was
more
balanced
the
taste
more
enjoyable
my
evaluation
went
from
decent
to
good
this
beer
cost
me
one
quarter
of
that
of
yorkshire
stingo
and
while
stingo
is
a
better
beer
this
is
pretty
good
one
at
less
than
5
for
a
500ml
bottle
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
sunday
one
to
sit
down
with
and
let
breath
a
sipper
to
have
with
a
sharp
cheddar
better
with
something
than
alone
certainly
worth
a
go

i

it

overall
brew
i
tend
to
stay
away
from
beers
that
come
in
clear

but
since
it
was
a
new
arrival
at
a
local
store
i
hoped
that
the
brew
wasnt

old
yet
i

its

wrapped

with
an
ongoing

about
it
overall
another
generic
english
ale
that
does
absolutely
nothing
to
set
itself
apart
other
than
the
higher
than
average
6
5
abv
and
labeling
it
a
vintage
ale
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
its
definitely
drinkable
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
higher
than
i
wanted
but
not
bad
as
a
whole
overall
a
very
nice
english
ale
went
fantastic
with
fish
and
chips
and
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
on
cask
definitely
something
i
would
pick
up
again
a
little
bit
weak
in
aroma
but
it
more
than
made
up
for
it

and

finishes
somewhat
dry
with
a
light
woody
earthy
flavor
a
little
sour
and
a
bit
of
hops
subdued
flavor
but
pleasant
flavors
are
not
that
well
integrated
a
bit
more
of
the
skunkiness
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
a
nice
ale
marred
by
off
taste
caused
by
use
of
clear
bottles
why
do
breweries
work
hard
for
a
nice
ale
and
then
allow
it
to
deteriorate
in
shipping
when
the
solution
is
so
simple
this
would
have
scored
a
point
higher
without
the
skunking
this
is
fairly
new
in
the
local
market
so
this
bottle
is
not
that
old
if
you
are
a
fan
of
english
ales
and
bitters
you
will
probably
like
this
more
than
most

a

there

of
a

character
slight
woody
astringency
and

with

nice

overall
quite

with
plenty
of

a
good

i

at

at

old
peculiar
and
this
one
and
i
definitely
prefer
op
over

d
i
would
not
recommend
this

and
probably
not
drink
it
again
myself
unless
in
dire
need
stick
to
old
speckled

for
a
tastier
and
mor
affordable
experience
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
an

also
of

who
would
have
thought
it

very

an

this
is
their

mixed
with

which
is
the
same
beer
they
blend
with
to
make
their

this
makes
2
beers

okuhnhenn
is
my
favorite
brewery
so
i
am
biased
but
i
could
have
a
blind
tasting
with
20
different
old
ales
and
this
would
guarantee
be
top
three
if
not
1
definitely
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
big
sweet
sugary

nice

odelicious

great
dessert
beer
love
sipping
this
o
amazeballscould
drink
this
one
all
day
aside
from
appearances
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bourbon
county
barleywine
god
bless
warren
mi
o
overall
a
hell
of
a
malt
bomb
to
round
out
your
day
with
delicious
smooth
and
dangerous
owas
expecting
a
lot
better
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
was
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
an
outstanding
old
ale
such
richness
and
complexity
set
it
well
above
most
other
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
encountered
this
is
a
beer
worth
hoarding
to
enjoy
over
many
years
very
highly
recommended
bb4d
is
definitely
a
better
choice
than
regular
4d
given
it
was
only
a
dollar
more
i
wouldnt
bother
with
4d
but
4d
is
a
great
beer
in
its
own
right
so
if
you
have
the
option
to
get
it
alongside
bb4d
i
would
definitely
recommend
taking
it
i
can
see
why
some
people
prefer
the
4d
to
the
bb4d
overall
i
thought
this
was
very
good
beer
and
very
good
example
of
an
old
ale
bells
third
coast
old
ale
was
my
favorite
old
ale
but
i
have
to
say
after
trying
this
i
think
4d
blows
it
out
of
the
water
not
that
third
coast
old
ale
isnt
great
4d
is
just
pretty
much
better
in
every
aspect
besides
price
and
its
just
a
more
intense
and
complex
version
of
old
ale
that
is
just
as
smooth
maybe
even
smoother
than
third
coast
old
ale
which
blows
my
mind
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
the
13
5
wasnt
nearly
as
noticeable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
was
fairly
smooth
complex
rich
a
little
sticky
pretty
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
bottle
would
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
and
if
i
had
the
chance
i
would
could
probably
drink
two
but
im
sure
i
would
be
feeling
it
in
the
morning
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
the
alcohol
was
hidden
it
seriously
blew
my
mind
that
a
13
5
old
ale
could
be
this
smooth
im
very
impressed
by
that
and
i
thought
the
taste
was
awesome
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
just
isnt
a
good
looking
which
overall
isnt
that
big
of
a
deal
and
i
learned
a
while
ago
to
never
judge
a
beer
on
its
looks
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
if
i
ever
saw
it
for
sale
its
pretty
pricey
but
i
think
its
worth
it
and
it
makes
for
a
nice
beer
for
a
special
occasions
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
old
ales
or
big
beers
in
general
i
dont
think
this
will
disappoint
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
expected
good
things
from
this
beer
but
all
together
it
exceeded
my
expectations
and
i
think
its
an
overall
great
beer
and
i
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
one
day
and
im
pretty
sure
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
cellar
and
i
think
it
could
get
even
better
with
time
great
work
guys
i
think
the
kuhnhenns
are
simply
the
best
at
what
they
do
and
this
is
a
world
class
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
guys
overall
excellent
stuff
the
look
was
awful
but
the
rest
of
the
experience
was
top
notch
lots
of
complex
and
bold
aromas
and
flavors
with
a
hefty
feel
to
support
it
all
definitely
something
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
dad
recommended
nice
thick
mouthfeel
coats
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
on
the
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
one
of
the
best
nonba
old
ales
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
consume
a
wonderful
sipper
on
nice
fall
evening
well
done
too
out
there
for
my
palate
just
far
too
syrupy
stupid
sweet
ick
this
is
a
great
olde
ale
with
a
perfect
appearance
and
an
excellent
aroma
with
an
equally
complex
flavor
and
active
carbonation
that
serves
this
beer
well
it
may
be
the
best
in
the
style
ive
ever
had
would
love
to
see
what
additional
aging
could
bring
to
this
beer
thanks
ryan
rpbuckeye
o
this
is
just
unbelievable
sweet
and
delicious
and
drinkable
to
the
point
of
being
very
dangerous
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
another
overall
love
when
a
beer
has
a
undefinable
complex
flavour
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
trying
to
reason
what
makes
it
so
good
this
is
that
and
more
a
must
have
and
probably
great
aged
a
few
years
o
if
this
wasnt
so
sticky
id
say
i
could
drink
this
anytime
but
im
wishing
i
had
saved
it
for
a
cold
winter
rather
than
a
cooler
summer
eve
decadent
brew
that
is
worth
seeking
out
im
no
doubt
in
the
minority
but
i
prefer
this
one
to
the
bourbon
barrel
version
its
not
by
a
huge
margin
but
its
still
there
the
bourbon
barrel
may
mellow
the
beer
out
a
tad
but
it
also
takes
away
notes
that
this
11
4d
had
and
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
4d
had
an
inexplicable
certain
bite
in
the
flavor
and
i
dont
mean
alcohol
that
really
intrigued
me
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
must
be
tried
if
it
can
be
found
o
great
beer
i
actually
think
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
the
barrel
aged
versions
the
caramel
fruit
and
spice
are
more
pronounced
in
this
beer
where
some
of
the
subtleties
get
lost
in
the
barrel
aged
version
really
nice
would
drink
again10
o
this
was
just
excellent
im
sure
its
great
fresh
as
well
but
i
think
the
two
years
in
the
cellar
really
took
this
one
up
a
level
quite
possibly
my
favorite
old
ale
i
cant
wait
to
crack
the
bb4d
sitting
in
my
fridge
i
dont
think
that
one
is
making
it
until
cold
weather
returns
any
kuhnhenn
in
the
cellar
means
life
is
good
kuhnhenn
beers
the
barrelaged
offerings
in
particular
are
objects
against
which
to
measure
the
rest
of
your
life
though
they
arent
cheap
these
beers
arent
about
being
wellheeled
theyre
about
being
welloff
in
the
sense
that
you
have
the
fortunate
circumstances
to
enjoy
some
of
americas
most
rare
and
unique
ales
o
boozey
dark
ale
with
lots
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
flavors
od
wonderfully
complex
lots
of
stuff
going
on
with
a
deep
boozy
character
and
richness
to
compliment
it
drinks
more
like
port
liked
it
lots
drink
i
thought
it
was
tasty
i
prefer
the
bruery
anniversary
old
ale
offerings
and
the
barrel
aged
4d
but
this
was
very
good
some
will
and
obviously
do
enjoy
this
but
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
one
big
beer
i
quite
like
it
but
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
although
i
do
have
a
sweet
tooth
alcohol
is
also
a
bit
much
i
do
wonder
if
it
will
mellow
with
age
in
any
event
quite
enjoyable
overall
lives
up
to
the
reputation
a
quite
drinkable
huge
beer
with
complex
taste
and
aroma
edit
poured
the
same
2012
vintage
on
feb
2015
the
hops
have
died
back
really
allowing
the
malt
profile
to
shine
a
certain
amount
of
spice
has
developed
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
adding
a
delicious
complexity
this
beer
is
only
getting
better
with
age
4
5
d
this
is
really
great
and
is
actually
probably
worth
the
higher
price
everything
is
exceptional
across
the
board
will
be
cellaring
another
to
try
in
a
year
or
two
o
i
still
think
this
is
overrated
but
it
is
a
good
brew
o
a
tasty
brew
that
is
incredibly
complex
the
nose
and
flavours
are
complex
and
i
found
that
they
became
even
more
diverse
as
the
brew
warmed
theres
a
reason
this
is
top
rated
and
i
will
definitely
be
grabbing
a
few
extra
bottle
to
age
very
well
rounded
and
enjoyable
definitely
a
sipper
and
one
is
enough
at
any
given
time
but
super
enjoyable

sweetness
and
lots
of
burnt
sugar
flowing
into
a
heavy
alcoholic
presence
some
bits
of
dark
roasted
grains
and
yeasty
fruitiness
chocolate
laps
at
the
nose
raisins
and
figs
in
there
as
well
taste
is
densely
sweet
with
the
aforementioned
raisins
and
figs
notes
of
coffee
and
bitter
cocoa
powder
hops
are
here
in
abundance
and
still
they
barely
control
the
massive
sugar
content
of
this
ale
earthy
in
character
and
mildly
pungent
they
bring
a
semblance
of
balance
to
this
beer
feel
is
thick
thick
like
a
sandwich
from
the
carnegie
deli
in
nyc
you
can
get
four
slices
of
extra
bread
and
still
have
to
stretch
your
mouth
to
bite
it
carbonation
is
mild
and
gentle
with
enough
pop
to
break
up
the
syrupy
sticky
nectar
this
is
a
beer
equivalent
to
napoleon
brandy
with
a
warming
quality
that
keeps
your
swallows
in
check
try
to
pound
this
one
and
you
are
lost
cause
sip
savor
and
warm
up
as
you
indulge
your
senses
in
this
one
while
it
may
work
with
sweeter
desserts
im
thinking
nuts
and
full
flavored
cheeses
as
a
perfect
compliment
to
this
one
overall
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
barrel
aged
version
but
still
an
impressive
beer
thanks
again
graniteskunk
an
awesome
extra
holy
shitballs
this
stuff
is
absolutely
incredible
i
know
im
probably
one
of
the
only
people
that
thinks
this
but
i
enjoy
the
regular
4d
much
more
than
the
barrelaged
version
i
dont
believe
that
barrelaging
always
makes
things
better
and
here
is
a
perfect
example
of
that
why
bourbon
barrel
aging
imparts
a
particular
and
dignified
set
of
flavors
in
my
opinion
these
flavors
kind
of
mask
what
i
love
so
much
about
4d
call
it
a
barleywine
or
an
old
ale
or
whatever
the
hell
you
want
this
beer
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
capabilities
of
not
only
its
style
but
beer
in
general
enjoy
this
beer
and
take
a
nap
then
thank
me
later
o
a
serious
old
ale
a
musthave
for
the
malt
lover
with
boatloads
of
maltiness
and
fruits
no
sign
of
hops
here
aboveaverage
drinkability
for
the
abv
its
surprisingly
mellow
and
smooth
flavors
are
quite
strong
of
course
but
not
sharp
and
overpowering
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
barrel
aged
version
of
this
o
i
was
very
nervous
after
the
initial
pour
but
the
complexity
of
this
one
and
how
it
blended
together
was
really
great
even
after
aging
for
over
a
year
its
a
bit
boozy
but
its
decently
hidden
with
all
of
the
different
types
of
flavors
flying
around
would
like
to
try
fresh
to
see
if
that
affected
the
pour
and
carbonation
and
id
also
like
to
try
to
the
barrel
aged
version
to
see
how
that
adds
another
awesome
element
of
complexity
allinall
a
great
beer
and
ill
buy
if
i
ever
make
it
up
to
anywhere
that
has
it
on
shelf
a
good
amount
of
grape
soda
and
tobacco
surfaces
on
the
palate
some
of
that
warming
liqueur
type
flavor
dries
things
up
lots
of
toasted
bread
crusts
and
big
grain
flavors
theres
a
somewhat
metallic
finish
that
lingers
over
all
of
those
surprisingly
palatable
malt
notes
its
big
its
complex
its
tasty
deep
brown
colour
a
little
more
than
one
finger
of
tan
head
great
retention
also
head
lasted
to
basically
the
bottom
of
the
glass
tons
of
white
sheets
of
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
nearly
perfect
looking
smell
has
tons
of
dark
malt
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
dark
sugars
and
dark
fruits
lots
of
cherry
with
some
plum
just
a
bit
of
booze
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
caramel
toffee
and
sugars
followed
up
cherry
and
fruit
some
warm
alcohol
and
vanilla
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
fruity
so
very
complex
without
ever
being
too
sweet
or
boozy
everything
comes
together
very
nicely
here
lightly
carbonated
massive
chewy
body
big
rich
mouthfeel
just
awesome
stuff
here
so
incredibly
drinkable
for
something
so
rich
and
complex
o
this
beer
has
just
enough
sweetness
and
alcohol
presence
in
this
beer
to
make
you
want
to
slowly
sip
it
preferably
on
a
cold
winter
evening
by
a
fireplace
to
enjoy
overall
would
i
buy
this
again
i
know
the
mouth
feel
isnt
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
but
this
is
a
quality
brew
it
improves
literally
after
every
sip
cant
remember
how
much
it
costs
but
f
it
you
only
live
once
salud
got
my
hands
on
a
fresher
bottle
at
a
tasting
on
8214
same
look
aroma
is
a
nutty
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
yum
flavor
follows
with
big
molasses
and
brown
sugar
caramel
and
definite
hazelnut
or
pecanpraline
notes
on
the
finish
that
really
make
this
beer
a
big
beer
but
so
yummy
it
goes
down
easy
this
is
awesome
i
guess
aging
it
for
6
years
is
too
much
just
fine
as
is
when
you
buy
it
oh
yea
overall
solid
beer
would
drink
again
looking
forward
to
many
more
from
kuhnhenn
o
a
pretty
decent
old
ale
overall
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
the
high
alcohol
but
avoids
being
cloying
the
nose
is
strong
caramel
malts
sugars
some
rum
vanilla
is
too
faint
initially
in
the
mouth
this
beer
explode
full
bodied
very
good
some
caramel
notes
with
a
good
bitterness
love
this
this
is
a
strong
and
complex
beer
needs
time
to
fully
appreciated
this
one
amazing
that
they
are
able
to
make
this
i
prefer
this
one
than
the
barrel
aged
version
both
are
good
but
this
one
is
better
to
me
not
sure
what
the
big
draw
is
on
this
beer
ive
had
it
a
few
times
now
and
have
never
enjoyed
it
my
favorite
of
a
favorite
style
perfection
looking
forward
to
opening
the
barrelaged
one
next
o
certainly
this
is
the
best
ale
that
ive
ever
had
absolutely
the
smoothest
most
wonderful
ale
ive
tried
overall
this
beer
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
big
beer
its
flavors
are
intense
and
it
pushes
the
style
guides
to
the
extreme
but
stays
with
the
constraint
besides
gravities
and
alcohol
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
capped
with
a
two
finger
semifizzy
light
beige
head
fair
retention
no
lacing
a
lot
of
booziness
on
the
nose
in
addition
to
huge
dark
fruit
and
caramel
notes
caramel
dark
fruit
specifically
black
cherry
hints
of
toffee
carry
through
the
very
boozy
finish
full
bodied
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
which
sticks
a
bit
to
and
coats
the
inside
of
the
mouth
an
excellent
brew
which
is
one
of
the
strongest
abv
old
ales
ive
had
however
the
booziness
works
with
this
sipper
as
it
is
fairly
wellbalanced
even
though
it
trends
on
the
sweeter
side
a
perfect
afterdinner
beer
and
also
plays
well
as
a
nightcap
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
desert
beer
i
didnt
expect
the
slightly
tart
note
but
it
didnt
seem
out
of
place
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
love
to
have
more
in
the
future
o
very
good
old
ale
on
the
sweeter
side
but
still
very
good
this
really
is
an
excellent
ale
i
cant
even
imagine
what
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
4d
is
like
this
honestly
feels
like
its
been
barrel
aged
nice
beer
o
i
like
this
beer
almost
as
much
as
bb4d
thank
you
beerworld
for
throwing
this
in
as
an
extra
o
overall
this
was
a
delicious
olde
ale
one
of
my
favourite
styles
when
done
right
it
is
absolutely
delicious
overall
4d
is
a
phenomenal
old
ale
i
will
certainly
be
buying
a
few
more
bottles
as
soon
as
i
get
the
chance
and
trying
my
best
to
trade
for
some
of
the
bourbon
edition
highly
recommended
for
any
lover

alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
for
13
5
with
only
a
warming
present
after
the
finish
definitely
a
sipper
but
is
still
very
smooth
as
such
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
incredible
old
ale
the
age
has
done
great
things
to
this
and
i
will
definitely
hold
on
to
the
2011
bottles
i
have
hugely
complex
and
balanced
stuff
o
im
a
big
fan
of
old
ales
and
this
one
is
quite
good
no
major
complaints
here
solid
all
around
highly
recommended
as
with
all
the
kuhnhenn
beers
i
have
had
i
really
like
this
one
what
an
interesting
brew
as
i
sip
on
this
i
am
craving
bbq
pork
very
enjoyable
even
though
some
factors
dont
hit
the
a
mark
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
originally
reviewed
01302012
overall
just
kind
of
average
flavors
and
the
low
carbonation
really
enhances
the
poorer
aspects
definitely
not
a
fan
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
well
concealed
booze
and
it
smells
great
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
elsewhere
even
if
this
is
a
off
bottle
its
still
easy
enough
too
drink
2011
vintage
poured
into
snifter
pours
a
deep
brown
amber
no
head
or
lacing
but
thats
to
be
expected
smell
is
fantastic
dried
fruit
booze
and
malts
taste
is
also
just
amazingi
cant
even
describe
just
get
this
fantastic
beer
absolutely
amazing
overall
this
is
a
great
old
ale
from
a
great
company
that
i
cant
get
around
these
parts
cost
8
for
a
12
oz
bottle
o
as
with
other
old
ales
has
a
lot
of
barleywinelike
characteristics
trying
to
keep
my
comparisons
limited
to
old
stock
ale
and
founders
curmudgeon
this
one
runs
a
little
sweeter
and
less
complex
than
the
old
stock
making
it
more
or
less
on
par
with
the
curmudgeon
a
good
beer
by
any
account
and
since
ive
never
seen
it
around
before
its
probably
one
of
those
you
should
pick
up
when
you
see
it
so
you
can
try
it
for
yourself
cheers
i
dunno
the
beer
has
some
big
bold
flavors
but
they
seem
to
contrast
each
other
the
beer
needs
a
bitter
offset
but
i
find
that
they
went
too
dry
with
an
acrid
bitterness
doesnt
blend
as
an
old
ale
should
perhaps
it
needs
some
major
aging
overall
i
like
the
bb
4d
but
regular
4d
really
doesnt
have
it
it
is
a
sweetandbooze
bomb
that
is
begging
for
some
balance
and
complexity
i
love
old
ales
old
stock
but
really
cant
deal
with
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
probably
wont
buy
again
m
full
bodies
silky
and
smooth
light
carbonation
an
exceptional
mouth
feel
o
wow
what
a
beer
not
for
everyone
as
this
is
a
big
bold
brew
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
its
an
absolute
must
try
does
this
beer
get
better
with
barrel
aging
im
not
sure
it
can
as
there
isnt
much
room
for
improvement
but
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
bb4d
and
find
out
highly
recommend
im
not
sure
what
i
think
of
this
im
generally
very
iffy
when
it
comes
to
malty
brews
in
the
old
alebarleywine
category
i
dislike
most
but
absolutely
love
some
and
so
i
keep
buying
them
not
sure
where
i
fall
here
its
one
where
i
dont
think
i
can
personally
appreciate
everything
it
brings
this
is
a
true
malt
lovers
dream
though
and
as
i
mentioned
the
complexity
is
impressive
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
with
some
really
nice
bold
flavors
to
it
its
little
boozy
and
sweet
at
times
which
prevents
it
from
being
truly
great
though
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
solid
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
though
this
beer
was
brewed
in
2011
a
well
crafted
yet
not
entirely
integrated
example
of
the
style
other
than
mellowing
the
alcohol
further
im
not
sure
this
would
benefit
from
extended
cellaring
better
served
to
contrast
a
strong
cheese
o
this
is
something
ive
been
wanting
to
try
since
i
found
out
about
kuhnhenn
it
really
doesnt
disappoint
after
driving
all
through
michigan
and
stopping
there
before
leaving
the
country
i
was
happy
to
get
4
of
these
and
4
of
the
bourbon
version
i
love
this
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
pours
a
garnetruddy
reddish
brown
with
a
1
finger
head
via
a
vigorous
pour
rich
plum
scent
w
other
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
also
some
caramel
and
vanilla
pretty
underwhelming
really
taste
is
sweet
and
boozy
slightly
astringent
more
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugars
tasty
indeed
the
mouth
is
smooth
with
an
odd
sweettart
thing
going
on
some
mild
heat
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
solid
beer
that
goes
down
way
too
easily
for
being
13
5
overall
very
good
sipper
im
going
to
sit
on
a
few
for
a
little
while
and
see
how
they
do
i
should
crack
my
09
soon
to
try
the
lower
alcohol
version
one
of
the
better
old
ales
that
i
have
tasted
will
seek
out
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
recommended
4
5
a
deeper
darker
take
on
the
old
ale
style
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
seek
this
out
again
pours
a
rich
chestnut
brown
nearly
clear
with
very
little
head
or
lacing
complex
aroma
is
vinous
sweet
toasted
marshmallows
as
mentioned
on
the
label
toffee
and
caramel
raisins
booze
woody
notes
flavor
equally
complex
but
less
sweet
theres
the
trace
of
marshmallow
and
toffee
from
the
nose
but
less
prominent
in
the
taste
oaky
slightly
corky
vinous
port
and
brandy
flavors
some
heat
and
warming
as
expected
from
the
high
abv
but
not
too
much
burn
pleasant
fusel
alcohol
presence
low
carbonation
but
not
still
a
little
sticky
somewhat
creamy
medium
body
could
be
a
bit
fuller
finishes
surprisingly
dry
tasty
old
ale
would
love
to
see
what
the
barrel
aging
brings
to
this
very
intriguing
beer
o
i
was
ready
for
this
to
be
a
huge
beer
and
it
just
wasnt
the
abv
i
believe
was
too
high
and
took
away
from
the
old
ale
characteristics
loved
the
aroma
wish
the
taste
and
feel
was
better
a
big
beer
to
be
savored
and
pondered
not
adam
but
what
is
o
nice
sipper
good
for
just
kind
of
mindlessly
sipping
and
subconsciously
going
mmm
enjoyable
overall
its
an
enjoyable
old
ale
and
a
complex
sipper
although
i
wonder
if
2
years
was
a
bit
more
age
than
necessary
kuhnhenn
fourth
dementia
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
couple
spots
of
ruby
appearing
once
the
beers
backlit
there
are
maybe
two
fingers
worth
of
khaki
colored
head
crowning
the
beer
and
head
retention
and
lacing
are
just
alright
the
nose
has
a
bevy
of
malty
notes
bouncing
around
light
chocolate
caramel
burnt
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
marshmallow
all
show
up
and
blend
together
for
a
killer
aroma
the
flavor
profile
cant
quite
keep
up
the
same
balanced
complexity
though
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
move
up
from
ensemble
players
in
the
aroma
to
the
main
attraction
here
milk
chocolate
falls
way
into
the
background
while
the
suggestion
of
marshmallow
disappears
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
but
as
rich
as
t
could
have
been
for
13
5
abv
the
carbonation
is
pleasantly
understated
and
theres
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
overall
fourth
dementia
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
can
see
why
i
enjoyed
the
barrel
aged
version
so
much
this
baby
screams
english
flavor
hops
are
very
subtle
this
is
a
nice
fireside
ssipper
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
for
comparrison
but
this
is
tasty
enough
as
it
is
2011
version
at
a
whopping
13
5
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
the
appearance
is
murky
brown
no
head
at
all
the
smell
is
of
rasins
butter
rum
and
toffee
the
taste
combines
the
same
with
just
a
hint
of
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
great
beer
cellar
worthy
for
sure
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
4d
poured
a
thick
muddy
brown
with
barely
a
cream
colored
halo
for
a
head
the
nose
is
malty
and
rich
with
strong
notes
of
fig
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
a
rich
malty
sweetness
with
toffee
and
fig
the
mouth
is
thick
and
viscous
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
decadent
old
ale
that
is
far
from
sessionable
but
is
very
tasty
and
one
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
enjoy
this
is
a
beer
that
combines
the
best
aspects
of
an
old
ale
with
some
really
good
barrel
notes
i
would
recommend
tracking
down
a
bottle
a
great
sensual
experience
to
savor
thank
god
i
live
in
michigan
d
this
would
be
ideal
as
a
dessert
beer
its
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
the
alcohol
is
concealed
very
well
so
this
one
could
be
dangerous
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
very
tasty
brew
the
barrel
aged
version
however
is
in
another
league
nice
flavors
but
too
sweet
for
me
to
handle
cheers
beertracker
o
very
nice
but
as
sweet
as
this
beer
is
a
sure
headache
and
sugar
rush
would
follow
on
a
single
beer
wow
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
abv
listed
on
the
bottle
is
12
50
so
a
very
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
stronger
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
o
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
considering
its
strength
a
2010
bottle
poured
into
an
oversized
snifter
the
appearance
is
ok
when
viewed
head
on
it
is
dark
almost
opaque
but
its
actually
a
copper
orange
when
held
to
the
light
no
head
when
poured
only
a
little
bit
of
fizz
the
smell
is
sweet
burnt
caramel
a
little
bit
of
raisiny
fruit
but
all
very
balanced
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
its
very
sweet
with
lots
of
the
caramel
mixed
with
that
hint
of
fruit
but
not
all
raisin
there
is
some
tangy
citrus
to
it
as
well
a
little
bit
of
burnt
biscuit
or
something
very
complex
and
different
things
pop
out
with
each
sip
its
nice
and
thick
almost
syrupy
and
coats
the
whole
palate
i
dont
get
much
of
the
alcohol
heat
which
is
a
change
from
the
last
time
i
had
this
nonbarrel
version
i
think
the
little
bit
of
extra
time
its
had
in
the
bottle
was
very
good
to
the
beer
drink
and
overall
definitely
very
drinkable
for
being
such
a
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
its
extremely
well
crafted
and
fairly
well
rounded
probably
the
best
old
ale
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
has
a
thickness
to
it
that
doesnt
dominate
the
palate
but
allows
the
flavor
lingers
nicely
o
well
balanced
complex
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
every
dinner
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
this
isnt
always
my
favorite
style
but
kuhnhenn
did
a
good
job
o
a
decent
brew
with
complexities
i
enjoy
trying
but
i
can
not
say
i
would
seek
it
out
this
bottle
was
the
2008
vintage
11
8
it
pours
a
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
murky
cherried
wood
brown
in
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
beige
lacing
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
some
cherry
raisins
brown
sugar
molasses
maple
syrup
with
some
light
oak
its
very
sweet
on
the
nose
yet
very
aromatic
you
can
tell
that
it
has
aged
well
thusfar
the
flavors
too
are
on
the
sweet
side
you
get
a
lot
of
raisins
figs
dates
light
oakearthiness
with
some
vanilla
as
well
its
very
complex
and
an
interesting
drink
its
kind
of
like
sipping
on
a
port
the
sugar
is
holding
me
back
from
grading
it
higher
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
is
sticky
on
the
palate
the
flavors
resonates
for
a
few
minutes
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
nice
old
ale
despite
the
grandiose
amount
of
sugar
its
very
very
complex
and
will
make
you
think
while
you
drink
it
its
well
worth
your
while
o
if
you
like
the
utopias
style
of
beer
then
you
would
enjoy
this
lots
of
malt
very
low
hop
character
and
low
carbonation
but
very
delicious
and
boozy
i
feel
good
after
just
one
pours
a
rusty
dark
brown
with
only
a
film
of
tan
head
nose
is
heavily
malty
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
plum
dried
dark
fruits
mollasses
toasted
marshmellow
taste
is
similiar
very
complex
mix
of
dark
malts
toffee
brown
sugar
heavily
mollasses
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
heavily
bodied
robust
malt
presence
makes
for
a
sweet
sipper
of
an
olde
ale
strong
alcohol
presence
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
i
picked
up
this
2010
vintage
bottle
in
secret
halloween
2011
the
pour
is
a
muddy
caramel
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
wonderful
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
hints
of
alcohol
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
mild
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
body
is
full
sticky
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
a
great
very
enjoyable
beer
thanks
michael
a
very
interesting
beer
not
really
like
anything
ive
had
before
i
would
definatly
seek
this
out
again
would
love
a
few
of
these
for
the
cellar
having
the
2
side
by
side
i
definatly
enjoyed
this
one
the
non
barrel
aged
version
better
the
ba
one
was
just
a
bit
too
hot
and
kinda
of
muddled
the
awesome
flavors
in
the
regular
one
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
enjoy
the
maltyness
pours
a
dark
amber
color
w
a
nice
sliver
of
a
cocoa
head
no
carbonation
or
lacing
smell
is
bourbon
caramel
toffee
some
alcohol
taste
is
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
w
a
toasted
marshmallow
flavor
as
well
awesome
great
feel
smooth
goes
down
easy
overall
this
is
an
incredible
brew
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
once
again
kudos
to
mentor
for
allowing
me
to
try
this
tasty
son
of
a
gun
o
this
is
what
an
old
ale
should
taste
like
so
well
balanced
and
the
all
the
flavors
that
came
through
on
the
taste
were
awesome
now
i
must
find
the
bb4d
o
a
decent
old
ale
definitly
not
my
favorite
i
very
much
prefer
the
barrel
aged
version
o
i
had
a
high
impression
of
the
barrelaged
fourth
dementia
when
it
was
first
released
unfortunately
even
that
version
has
fallen
off
but
it
is
far
better
than
the
sugar
bomb
its
base
beer
turned
out
to
be
we
didnt
finish
either
version
but
we
poured
out
more
of
this
o
well
this
beer
definitely
doesnt
lack
flavor
perhaps
my
palate
just
isnt
prepared
for
the
overload
of
sweet
malts
that
this
one
delivered
i
found
it
to
be
too
sweet
o
im
relatively
new
to
this
style
but
i
know
that
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
flavor
and
taste
are
great
and
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
or
try
bb4d
o
the
best
old
ale
i
have
ever
had
it
does
remind
me
of
a
barleywine
and
maybe
that
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
but
still
amazing
i
like
the
faint
banana
flavor
here
unlike
some
old
ales
that
remind
me
of
a
banana
split
i
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
transient
and
falls
to
a
ring
big
legs
on
this
one
nose
has
dried
dark
fruits
sweet
caramel
notes
and
a
hint
of
metal
taste
reflects
this
without
the
metal
note
which
diminished
with
warmth
more
dried
dark
fruits
berries
and
currants
booze
caramel
and
something
i
kept
percieving
as
oak
although
im
confident
this
isnt
oak
aged
mouthfeel
was
medium
heavy
with
a
moderate
sweetness
thats
restrained
by
some
drier
qualities
throughout
great
drinkability
and
doesnt
even
come
close
to
feeling
like
the
alcohol
content
advertised
need
to
get
my
lips
on
the
bourbon
barreled
version
had
a
small
glass
at
the
stags
head
i
had
a
couple
other
nice
beers
at
the
stag
but
man
this
one
stood
out
it
wasnt
overly
thick
and
theres
was
no
knock
of
alcohol
the
flavor
was
a
rich
mix
of
dates
raisins
caramel
and
cocoa
there
were
mild
hints
of
toffee
cola
and
grapefruit
hops
to
round
this
out
making
for
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
a
nice
beer
that
shows
significant
improvement
as
it
warms
up
not
a
style
that
ive
had
before
but
in
many
ways
it
reminds
me
of
a
barley
wine
at
first
put
off
but
as
i
tasted
it
more
began
to
enjoy
it
would
have
again
especially
during
winter
recommend
2010
vintage
i
was
hoping
to
have
this
sidebyside
with
the
barrelaged
version
but
the
pleasant
memories
of
that
surprise
bottle
will
suffice
while
i
take
this
bottle
down
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
russet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
toffee
light
booze
white
bread
maple
syrup
and
a
few
drops
of
chocolate
syrup
the
taste
holds
notes
of
boozy
caramel
dark
fruit
mostly
figlike
id
say
pine
sap
sourdough
very
light
chocolate
powder
and
honey
its
a
strange
grocery
list
but
it
all
comes
together
pleasantly
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thick
almost
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
but
one
that
seems
a
bit
hot
at
the
moment
making
for
a
tasty
but
slightly
painful
drinking
experience
that
said
id
do
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
a
very
good
beer
overall
and
almost
certainly
the
best
ive
had
in
its
category
o
quite
good
stuff
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
the
high
13
abv
is
noticeable
but
a
welcomed
addition
to
the
depth
of
flavor
overall
a
great
beer
thanks
ron
brew
poured
a
deep
purple
with
a
thin
frothy
creamy
head
that
hung
out
for
a
few
minutes
smell
is
exactly
as
last
time
nutmeg
caramel
and
some
vanilla
malt
and
plum
really
well
done
old
ale
flavor
is
dominated
by
rasins
and
figs
strong
sweetness
almost
quadlike
booze
is
invisibile
great
beer
a
bit
overly
sweet
the
ba
takes
this
great
beer
and
makes
it
legendary
always
a
treat
to
have
the
original
very
well
hidden
13
abv
but
the
overall
feel
and
flavor
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
kind
of
light
feel
for
the
style
good
overall
but
nothing
blew
me
away
about
it
i
have
another
bottle
to
age
well
see
where
that
one
goes
o
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
old
ale
a
well
made
beer
all
around
pours
a
deep
brown
w
ruby
red
highlight
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
raisins
and
other
dark
dried
fruits
lots
of
caramel
and
unfortunately
very
apparent
alcohol
the
initial
taste
is
hot
alcohol
followed
by
raisins
and
figs
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
also
quite
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
smoke
finishes
a
bit
bitter
pretty
full
mouthfeel
but
not
overwhelmingly
heavy
leaves
some
lingering
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
bit
too
fresh
perhaps
as
the
alcohol
is
quite
apparent
however
the
alcohol
presence
doesnt
ruin
this
by
any
means
i
have
a
few
bottles
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
after
a
year
or
two
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
nice
old
ale
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
barrelaged
version
though
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
part
of
a
generous
trade
from
a
great
trader
semibaked
the
pour
generates
two
fingers
of
head
that
dissipate
quickly
leaving
a
ring
that
lingers
throughout
the
color
is
a
really
dark
brown
with
a
brick
rim
the
nose
is
very
sweet
malty
and
slightly
boozy
im
getting
some
walnut
and
honey
that
i
really
like
in
the
smell
the
flavor
is
caramel
and
malt
all
the
way
man
this
is
sweet
but
in
a
very
good
way
balanced
by
the
good
carbonation
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
warm
but
approaching
hot
with
a
lingering
sugar
sweetness
great
beer
would
have
many
times
over
13
5
but
no
problems
finishing
this
12ozer
overall
an
excellent
big
brew
lots
of
rich
flavors
meld
well
together
2010
vintage
overall
a
beautiful
and
fantastic
smelling
beer
only
knocked
down
by
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
o
good
would
drink
again
albeit
not
search
it
out
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
and
perhaps
the
size
wasnt
matched
with
enough
complexity
or
balance
for
me
i
love
big
brew
but
this
wasnt
exciting
pours
a
deep
caramel
brown
no
lacing
and
minimal
head
which
disappears
completely
within
a
few
minutes
aroma
is
caramel
and
malt
brown
sugar
some
toffee
rye
toast
musky
and
leather
notes
chocolate
and
candied
cherries
alcohol
burn
is
noticeable
on
the
nose
the
taste
picks
up
a
lot
of
the
nice
complex
flavors
in
the
aromas
especially
the
sweet
caramel
malt
milk
chocolate
and
toffee
a
little
bitterness
coats
the
mouth
on
the
finish
warm
full
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
which
is
probably
high
for
the
style
but
works
fine
for
me
a
little
hot
going
down
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
complex
beer
a
real
sipper
but
still
quite
drinkable
despite
the
body
and
alcohol
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
on
both
the
nose
and
palate
not
terribly
surprising
but
knocks
it
down
a
notch
overall
this
is
a
great
old
ale
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
in
the
dark
maltcocoa
flavor
profile
but
absolutely
still
delicious
brandy
soaked
toffee
covered
cherries
is
a
single
sentence
descriptor
this
has
aged
superbly
and
shows
no
signs
to
deterioration
even
after
5
years
wonderful
old
ale
o
a
superb
beer
i
have
been
holding
onto
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
it
certainly
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
will
certainly
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
way
to
land
a
couple
of
these
in
the
future
to
toss
in
the
cellar
overall
youd
never
guess
that
the
beer
had
13
5
alcohol
its
very
well
hidden
and
while
the
taste
is
very
sweet
it
isnt
too
over
the
top
id
definitely
like
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
on
hand
for
the
colder
months
its
a
well
crafted
and
well
balanced
beer
and
is
well
worth
seeking
out
im
curious
to
see
how
some
age
will
treat
it
d
an
enjoyable
sipper
that
has
all
the
characteristics
of
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
had
no
problem
getting
through
the
first
six
ounces
of
beer
but
have
significantly
slowed
down
since
then
i
will
not
have
anything
else
besides
water
after
i
am
done
a
year
and
a
half
later
had
this
next
to
bb4d
and
this
seemed
a
bit
much
on
the
burnt
sugar
the
barrels
rounded
off
those
flavors
just
a
bit
and
added
a
nice
backing
warmth
both
highly
recommended
but
bb4d
takes
the
cake
for
me
overall
solid
beer
by
kuhnhenn
this
is
my
first
beer
by
this
brewery
i
think
i
prefer
founders
curmugedeon
but
this
beer
is
still
on
the
same
scale
thanks
kirk
up
next
is
the
barrell
aged
version
o
its
not
quite
adam
but
its
still
damn
good
45
o
a
great
brew
1st
time
ive
had
it
since
gabf
last
year
love
this
one
great
brew
a
must
try
and
a
must
find
d
a
total
sipper
but
very
good
would
be
tough
to
drink
more
than
1
bottle
of
this
in
a
sitting
imminently
drinkable
delicious
and
easy
going
down
not
bad
at
all
but
i
expect
more
complexity
from
ales
as
strong
as
this
its
just
too
onedimensional
picked
this
up
from
a
great
trade
with
page101
clear
rubybrown
pour
with
almost
no
head
and
minimal
lacing
earthy
complex
malty
nose
with
hints
of
toffee
caramel
oak
rye
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
complex
as
well
and
also
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
lots
of
roasty
toffee
caramel
and
hazelnut
with
a
boozy
woody
bite
hints
of
rye
raisins
figs
vanilla
and
oak
extremely
rich
with
a
nice
subtle
alcohol
warming
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
thick
and
chewy
and
plenty
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
the
alcohol
warms
but
for
the
most
part
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
such
a
big
beer
another
great
michigan
beer
cant
wait
to
try
the
bourbon

on

the
body
is
a
dark
brown
with
almost
ruby
highlights
topped
with
a
dirty
whitetan
head
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
the
nose
on
this
monster
is
amazing
caramel
dark
fruit
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
once
it
hits
my
lips
im
in
love
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
caramel
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
notes
shine
i
detect
some
slight
earthiness
that
plays
with
the
sweetness
perfectly
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
great
my
favorite
old
ale
to
date
i
will
find
more
to
age
overall
the
beers
character
is
very
enjoyable
i
am
sitting
on
a
couple
more
bottles
and
hope
to
see
what
a
little
time
does
for
this
beer
md
medium
carbonation
very
thick
almost
like
syrup
awesome
texture
the
booze
is
totally
there
but
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
i
want
to
try
again
medium
body
and
slightly
syrupy
with
some
soft
carbonation
and
subtle
spice
up
front
theres
a
slightly
earthy
leathery
character
but
this
beer
is
bursting
with
sweet
malt
flavor
hints
of
caramel
toffee
biscuit
hazelnut
and
rye
which
are
countered
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
by
a
boozy
hot
finish
with
a
decent
hop
bite
theres
a
decent
barrel
presence
with
a
good
amount
of
oakywood
flavor
along
with
some
more
sweet
booze
this
beer
is
pretty
complex
but
is
very
hot
at
this
stage
and
the
abv
is
not
very
well
masked
its
13
5
and
you
can
feel
it
in
the
finish
definitely
a
sipper
that
should
improve
with
time
but
right
now
its
still
a
bit
rough
overall
for
being
so
young
of
a
beer
i
get
literally
almost
no
alcohol
warmth
nor
taste
amazing
seeing
as
it
is
over
13
abv
a
spectacular
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
and
by
golly
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
bb
version
of
this
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
before
the
bb
version
glad
i
have
another
one
of
these
to
age
o
applause
o
as
my
roommate
said
about
this
beer
the
only
thing
that
could
make
this
better
is
if
they
aged
it
in
bourbon
barrels
oh
wait
they
did
this
is
a
stellar
beer
the
only
old
ale
ive
had
which
even
compares
is
its
bourbonbarrel
brother
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
hides
its
alcohol
well
it
is
still
a
sipper
but
pretty
addicting
i
found
myself
content
with
a
12oz
bottle
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
experience
overall
this
olde
ale
from
the
kuhnhenn
clan
is
miles
better
than
anticipated
by
this
reviewer
to
expect
greatness
and
have
an
experience
that
exceeds
greatness
is
a
wonderful
thing
this
is
a
very
fine
recipe
and
despite
the
seating
of
the
cap
having
a
precarious
look
to
it
the
joy
inside
is
fully
intact
and
amazing
this
is
an
olde
ale
that
begs
to
be
revisited
o
every
once
in
a
while
a
beer
comes
along
that
is
best
described
using
nonbeer
descriptors
this
was
one
of
those
brews
impressive
clings
to
the
glass
and
everything
my
palate
nose
and
eyes
cant
leave
the
beer
alone
woah
burnt
orange
color
matches
the
burnt
sweet
orange
flavor
sticky
burnt
sugar
sweetness
and
citrus
hop
bitterness
blend
and
become
confection
greatness
an
indulgence
a
slight
amount
of
oxidation
present
on
the
finish
great
in
all
ways
proficient
saying
this
to
my
now
emty
glass
will
seek
more
of
this
in
differnt
years
and
to
experience
this
one
of
a
kind
brew
again
2010
vintage
pours
a
amberbrown
colour
with
thick
offwhite
head
streaks
of
lacing
around
the
glass
with
great
head
retention
smells
of
candy
sugar
cherry
butterscotch
vanilla
oak
caramel
and
toasted
malt
very
sweet
flavour
booze
is
a
bit
apparent
as
well
quite
complex
flavour
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
smooth
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
my
first
kuhnhenn
beer
and
im
really
enjoying
it
very
good
old
ale
i
will
say
it
leans
more
towards
a
barleywine
at
this
point
i
am
positive
age
will
do
this
well
but
am
curious
to
see
how
it
changes
very
drinkable
all
thing
considered
definitely
boozy
but
it
never
becomes
obstructive
definitely
recommend
trying
at
least
once
a
great
overall
beer
a
little
difficult
to
find
as
well
as
pricey
which
knocks
this
down
a
bit
i
have
a
bottle
of
the
ba
version
that
ive
been
meaning
to
try
but
i
only
have
1
bottle
so
im
saving
it
for
a
special
occasion
this
beer
is
a
solid
sipper
pours
a
barely
translucent
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
looks
good
smells
amazing
raisin
and
other
dark
fruits
darn
near
fill
the
room
deep
rich
and
earthy
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
old
ale
smells
good
start
taste
is
very
sweet
with
that
nice
sweet
thin
front
and
a
touch
of
hopsbitterness
in
the
back
for
balance
just
recently
had
a
jw
lees
88
99
and
08
and
this
tastes
a
lot
like
a
slightly
better
version
of
the
99
i
had
the
sweetness
here
is
aggressive
and
not
as
off
putting
as
the
lees
99
that
said
this
beer
is
very
very
similar
what
i
dont
get
is
that
essence
of
ham
that
sometimes
comes
up
in
the
jw
lees
for
me
and
for
me
that
makes
this
a
winner
mouthfeel
is
somehow
thinner
than
what
the
sticky
sweetness
eludes
to
if
it
were
any
thicker
its
still
mediumheavy
the
sweetness
would
cover
the
tongue
and
be
offensive
so
while
thinner
than
expected
this
is
actually
welcome
overall
this
beer
is
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
am
impressed
that
this
tastes
very
similar
to
a
beer
aged
12
years
and
yet
comes
off
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
if
it
werent
so
sweet
it
would
be
phenomenal
barely
a
touch
of
alcohol
which
is
very
impressive
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
not
my
bag
with
the
huge
sweetness
still
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
dave
drinkability
moderate
the
high
abv
really
keeps
it
honest
and
the
super
sweetness
could
become
a
bit
much
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
beer
that
is
probably
better
shared
this
came
highly
recommended
cheers
kuntz
well
worth
17
for
a
four
pack
it
has
a
nice
balanced
mouthfeel
high
maltiness
caramel
beginning
that
has
a
slight
alcoholiness
to
it
and
deep
vanilla
and
toasty
oak
flavors
i
taste
an
almost
bourbon
undertone
as
well
it
finishes
smooth
with
a
vanilla
and
caramel
sweet
maltiness
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
this
a
nicely
balanced
for
13
5
abv
im
sure
this
would
cellar
well
and
id
be
interested
to
taste
one
a
couple
years
old
very
well
done
i
usually
prefer
more
hops
but
this
is
delicious
overall
well
done
and
what
i
would
expect
from
an
old
ale
the
high
abv
is
present
but
not
overbearing
i
would
love
to
try
the
bourbonbarrelaged
version
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
some
more
this
one
to
sit
on
im
sure
this
beer
is
great
with
a
couple
years
on
it
glad
i
got
to
finally
savor
this
gentle
beast
at
my
favorite
beer
bar
its
pretty
much
impossible
to
find
this
anywhere
so
im
very
thankful
hopcat
brought
in
a
keg
great
stuff
on
a
sunny
laidback
winter
afternoon
notes
big
old
ale
probably
the
most
exemplary
version
of
the
style
i
have
had
cannot
find
one
thing
wrong
with
this
beer
one
of
my
first
beers
from
this
highlyspoken
of
brewery
and
i
look
forward
to
the
rest
d
this
shit
is
the
real
deal
definition
of
complexity
and
it
blows
my
mind
the
variety
of
well
defined
flavors
that
emerge
at
13
5
abv
the
fuel
is
present
but
not
in
a
burning
or
instrusive
way
the
aroma
is
so
awesome
i
could
almost
just
smell
this
brew
and
not
even
taste
it
almost
when
i
think
of
a
end
of
the
night
snifter
this
very
rich
brew
is
the
benchmark
d
kuhnhenn
does
a
fantastic
job
with
alcohol
involvement
or
lack
of
and
it
shows
in
this
brew
no
unpleasantness
at
all
this
goes
down
very
well
sip
after
sip
i
wouldnt
call
it
very
drinkable
but
as
high
abv
as
this
is
its
very
nice
edit
this
was
the
2010
batch
not
nearly
as
good
pours
a
more
yellow
golden
color
and
has
lost
many
good
qualities
only
12
5
alcohol
here
but
it
is
more
hidden
overwhelming
tartness
and
lots
of
cherry
are
present
2010
was
much
better
all
in
all
this
beer
is
definitely
not
as
good
as
i
would
have
hoped
or
as
ive
seen
it
rated
but
its
still
a
good
brew
to
try
at
least
once
if
you
like
the
style
the
2010
is
13
5
abv
and
that
is
very
surprising
in
this
one
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
this
beer
is
pretty
huge
but
it
enters
a
different
realm
of
drinkability
sipability
the
cant
recall
the
abv
on
my
bottle
but
it
was
in
the
13
neighborhood
this
is
a
long
evening
sipper
just
the
thing
you
need
this
time
of
year
d
hell
yeah
this
is
what
an
old
ale
tastes
like
sweet
in
all
the
right
places
but
so
very
subtle
and
smooth
i
could
drink
this
for
days
alcohol
is
hidden
exceptionally
well
again
i
cant
thank
you
enough
jeff
for
handing
this
one
over
to
me
drinkabilitythis
beer
is
right
on
in
terms
of
style
and
deliciously
rendered
there
is
a
ton
of
complexity
in
all
aspects
of
this
beer
d
it
surely
has
the
alcohol
punch
to
it
cant
go
balls
to
the
wall
on
this
monster
sip
or
be
punched
out
it
could
use
with
a
bit
more
time
mellowing
out
in
terms
of
sweetness
and
alcohol
perhaps
itll
age
even
better
i
like
it
id
like
to
have
it
again
in
the
future
d
this
has
great
drinkability
for
a
12
5
beer
it
was
a
sweet
which
limited
my
ability
to
consume
a
lot
fast
but
i
definitely
wanted
more
and
more
d
a
really
great
old
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
thought
this
beer
smelled
amazing
and
was
very
complex
and
balanced
while
the
taste
was
a
step
down
and
a
tiny
disappointment
after
the
smell
it
was
still
very
good
i
thought
it
also
had
an
amazing
mouthfeel
and
while
definitely
a
sipper
the
abv
is
well
hidden
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
one
12oz

2008
vintage
pours
a
hazy
auburn
with
a
frothy
creamcolored
two
inch
head
nose
suggests
figs
prunes
a
metallic
element
as
well
as
a
savory
herbal
character
theres
also
perhaps
a
hint
of
candy
and
pepper
taste
is
sweet
savory
and
a
touch
smokey
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
lively
carbonation
an
interesting
beer
perhaps
still
a
little
young
just
not
what
i
expected
very
drinkable
for
an
old
ale
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
it
is
fair
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
for
a
sipper
a
little
less
cloying
sweetness
would
go
a
long
way
the
experience
drinking
this
brew
is
quite
interesting
the
flavor
really
developes
as
more
sips
are
taken
initially
it
is
overkill
with
sugary
vanilla
caramel
sweetness
that
turns
to
a
more
toasty
grain
bitter
and
high
alcohol
presence
each
sip
yields
quite
a
different
range
of
character
well
done
bottle
2008

pours
a
reddish
mahagony
color
with
a
nice

that

the
aroma
is
very
interesting
with
a
mix
of
caramel

chocolate
dark
fruit
vanilla
with
some

the
smell
is
super
intense

very
intense
rich
flavors
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
good
head
retention
and
nice
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
nice
old
ale
it
is
a
bit
malty
but
i
like
the
warming
flavors
much
better
than
a
lot
of
the
other
old
ales
out
there
a
sipper
for
sure
due
to
the
high
abv
and
rich
sweet
flavors
the
perfect
beer
for
a
fall
day
in
mi
3
5
this
is
pretty
much
the
definition
of
a
sipper
but
it
is
quite
tasty
and
the
perfect
beer
to
slowly
enjoy
over
a
long
period
of
time
not
the
best
old
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
a
quality
example
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
very
minimal
head
aromas
of
honey
molasses
dark
brown
sugar
and
oak
on
the
palate
this
one
is
quite
boozy
with
rum
soaked
dark
fruits
and
more
of
the
above
sugars
an
enjoyable
beer
but
one
i
wouldnt
want
a
large
quantity
i
received
this
beer
as
an
extra
from
stopbarking
thanks
very
much
for
including
this
beer
which
has
been
on
my
wants
list
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
the
color
is
clear
ruby
with
a
fingers
worth
of
white
heading
the
smell
is
of
honey
nectar
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
sweet
to
the
point
of
almost
being
cloying
with
all
of
the
same
flavors
listed
above
coming
off
very
juicy
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
on
the
palate
while
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
and
can
be
smelled
and
tasted
certainly
not
a
gulping
beer
as
the
strong
tastes
and
abv
prevent
that
most
of
the
kuhnhenn
brews
i
have
had
all
have
a
certain
sickly
sweetness
and
richness
to
them
and
fourth
dementia
is
no
different
this
is
one
to
sip
after
dinner
like
port
or
whiskey
o
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
id
been
interested
in
it
for
a
while
now
d
too
sweet
i
love
some
strong
ales
but
this
one
seems
a
bit
under
attenuated
and
really
disagrees
with
my
taste
buds
thanks
marc
for
this
2008
brewery
aged
bottle
pours
a
deep
brown
cherry
red
edges
nose
is
rich
and
malty
full
of
pineaplle
and
something
like
bubble
gum
reminds
me
of
that
fruit
stripes
gum
and
sweet
diced
pineapples
very
nostalgic
nose
flavor
is
sweet
and
tangy
at
first
still
alot
of
that
pineapple
sweet
fruits
especially
on
the
front
palate
which
is
kind
of
odd
and
some
old
hops
bitter
and
balance
it
a
bit
kind
of
tangy
almost
sour
finish
but
quite
well
put
together
the
sugar
content
here
must
be
off
the
charts
but
it
works
well
and
its
an
interesting
barleywine
for
sure
better
than
the
bottle
version
ive
had
but
still
only
a
decent
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
12
tan
head
over
the
cloudy
reddish
brown
brew
head
lasts
nicely
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
grains
tart
fruitiness
and
alcohol
flavor
is
sweet
to
start
with
heavy
dark
fruitiness
in
the
middle
which
fades
into
an
alcohol
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
but
this
one
just
seems
too
fruity
and
tart
for
the
style
more
like
cough
syrup
unfortunately
d
im
a
big
fan
of
kuhnhenn
and
this
beer
is
one
of
the
reasons
an
amazing
beer
and
maybe
the
best
old
ale
around
overall
maybe
a
bit
hyped
or
maybe
2008
wasnt
a
great
vintage
or
maybe
it
was
aged
past
its
prime
this
is
extremely
drinkable
very
smooth
and
delicious
just
be
careful
of
that
high
abv
you
dont
taste
it
but
you
will
certainly
feel
it
after
just
a
little
bit
of
time
goes
by
drinkability
is
good
a
big
beer
and
definitely
a
sipper
im
really
liking
the
fruity
caramel
flavors
the
nose
is
also
quite
pleasant
and
adds
to
the
overall
enjoyment
pretty
sure
i
could
finish
a
bottle
of
this
by
myself
im
also
glad
i
have
another
bottle
aging
in
the
cellar
this
beer
should
come
along
nicely
with
a
few
years
on
it
very
well
done
old
ale
nice
work
kuhnhenn
the
beer
pours
an
amberred
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
with
some
alcohol
molasses
maple
and
oak
the
flavor
is
just
as
complex
with
cherries
brown
sugar
alcohol
toffee
and
caramel
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
complex
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
one
and
done
here
it
isnt
a
bad
thing
though
one
must
explore
the
complexity
of
this
over
many
sips
its
a
deep
brown
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
decent
1
cm
head
tannish
colored
surprising
for
a
2year
old
beer
id
say
the
smell
is
really
nice
comes
off
with
a
carameltoffee
sweetness
from
the
malts
really
caramellized
nicely
in
there
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
there
are
also
some
notes
of
tobacco
and
a
slight
mustiness
maybe
its
my
imagination
on
this
last
one
really
fascinating
and
very
deeply
complex
the
taste
just
really
fascinates
you
from
the
first
particularly
if
you
like
some
malt
it
just
comes
out
with
caramel
like
caramel
coated
herby
grassstraw
cola
flavored
grain
great
maltiness
here
very
complex
but
really
sort
of
comes
outright
and
tells
you
its
here
i
get
a
nice
flavor
of
chocolate
a
little
roastiness
which
blends
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
the
little
bit
of
age
has
done
wonders
and
i
can
tell
it
will
hold
up
for
longer
the
body
has
a
huge
thickness
sticky
and
sweet
but
the
carbonation
peeks
through
with
a
strong
enough
presence
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
this
is
really
a
great
display
of
malt
and
i
found
myself
continually
drinking
it
almost
too
much
so
i
couldnt
wait
on
it
to
warm
enough
to
see
the
differences
in
flavor
will
keep
you
interested
id
say
a
great
beer
beer
is
sweet
with
an
apple
middle
and
dry
finish
the
forward
beer
is
thin
but
the
body
fills
out
in
the
midpalate
somehow
to
finish
with
a
medium
to
full
body
interesting
i
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
some
age
on
it
dirnkability
was
pretty
good
mouthfeel
was
confusing
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
tastes
as
if
it
is
much
older
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
there
is
just
a
touch
of
heat
that
will
surely
be
less
noticeable
with
longer
cellaring
ive
got
another
bottle
that
id
like
to
hide
away
for
several
years
definitely
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
up
there
this
is
a
superb
old
ale
with
wonderful
flavors
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
one
that
would
be
great
to
set
aside
for
a
few
years
im
a
massive
fan
of
fourth
dementia
its
in
my
top
10
without
a
doubt
it
absolutely
explodes
with
flavor
and
the
blend
is
perfectly
suited
for
my
palate
if
you
like
old
ales
this
should
be
near
the
top
of
your
todrink
list
tastes
awesome
now
but
age
will
be
kind
to
this
yet
it
did
take
me
awhile
to
finish
the
bottle
though
but
this
one
you
gotta
sip
complex
and
silky
sweet
medium
body
lightly
syrupy
very
active
but
not
quite
fizzy
carbonation
perhaps
more
than
id
like
but
gives
a
distinctive
almost
fluffy
feel
you
get
a
good
two
fingers
at
first
of
light
tan
creamy
foam
mostly
microfoam
with
a
pile
here
or
there
of
larger
bubbles
above
average
retention
with
a
brush
of
lacing
here
or
there
unusual
clarity
for
the
category
with
a
deep
cherry
red
veneer
only
a
very
slight
fade
to
more
base
orange

the
rims
highly

without
clumsiness
fullbodied
and
then
some
covers
every
mouth
pore
like

given
its

keeps
its
balance
although
you
do
suspect
you
could
light
the
surface
with
a
match
no
port
handy
drink
this
beer
the
beer
is
full
bodied
with
a
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
rich
complex
and
potent
malt
sipper
highly
recommended
though
id
suggest
you
share
the
bottle
mahogany
hue
with
a
very
substantial
head
and
plenty
of
lace
aromas
of
sweet
tobacco
alcohol
rich
malts
raisins
this
beer
has
great
complexity
my
initial
thoughts
upon
my
first
sip
were
that
this
instantly
reminds
me
of
a
great
english
barleywine
particularly
j
w
lees
secondly
this
beer
tastes
much
older
than
it
is
i
really
thought
the
alcohol
while
certainly
not
hidden
did
not
overpower
the
beer
or
present
any
undesirable
harshness
on
the
palate
there
is
a
long
lingering
aftertaste
consisting
of
sweet
caramels
toffee
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
great
beer
probably
best
in
small
quantities
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
could
have
a
couple
glasses
of
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
im
not
sure
that
more
than
2
or
3
glasses
would
continue
to
be
great
but
the
both
glasses
i
enjoyed
were
great
and
the
flavor
got
better
the
more
in
took
over
my
palate
drinkability
a
great
sipper
great
strong
malt
presence
without
being
overly
sweet
a
variety
of
tastes
but
it
stays
consistent
most
of
the
way
through
a
clean
finish
helps
keep
the
taste
refreshing
d
cant
do
it
the
sweetness
is
too
coating
and
overpowering
the
sugar
and
licorice
tastes
dominate
too
much
and
overpower
the
taste
buds
to
the
point
of
being
painful
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
really
average
at
best
its
just
tough
to
take
down
too
much
of
and
i
have
a
high
sweet
tolerance
although
its
not
as
high
as
it
used
to
be
still
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
down
if
you
offered
it
to
me
again
im
probably
not
the
best
judge
of
this
beer
for
two
reasons
i
dont
have
alot
of
experience
with
old
ales
and
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
sweet
beers
even
the
almighty
dl
is
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
with
that
said
it
is
clear
that
this
beer
is
something
special
theres
is
alot
going
on
with
all
the
different
dark
fruit
aromas
and
tastes
that
are
going
on
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
it
seems
that
its
a
pretty
sought
after
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
if
the
situation
arises
again
ill
go
at
it
one
more
time
d
as
high
octane
as
this
one
is
i
loved
it
i
think
it
was
the
first
keg
to
blow
at
the
festival
and
for
good
reason
awesome
pours
a
clear
amber
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
and
slight
dark
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
old
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
alcohol
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
slight
hop
slight
vanilla
and
slight
tart
malt
overall
a
good
body
but
the
blend
is
off
too
strong
of
alcohol
dthis
has
huge
flavors
and
a
great
set
of
maltiness
the
feel
is
great
and
it
is
so
smooth
and
creamy
it
is
a
little
hot
right
now
so
i
could
see
a
couple
years
making
this
explode
pretty
decent
drinkability
the
abv
is
veeeery
well
hidden
almost
dangerously
so
it
is
almost
too
sweet
and
candylike
reminiscent
of
sugar
coated
dark
fruits
j
d
a
bit
strong
still
to
be
easily
drinkable
definitely
a
great
beer
though
d
for
such
a
big
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
i
think
it
may
be
tough
to
drink
to
much
of
this
due
to
the
abv
but
one
worth
seeking
out
d
incredibly
complex
and
smooth
for
the
alcohol
volume
it
has
this
is
definitely
one
to
hold
onto
for
a
while
glad
to
have
tried
it
id
call
it
more
of
a
barleywine
in
so
many
of
these
categories
id
probably
give
it
a
little
higher
mouth
and
drinkability
at
least
as
one
too
but
hey
well
thats
me
thank
you
waltonc
you
sir
are
a
class
act
glad
to
try
it
though
d
sip
it
slow
and
enjoy
by
a
fire
bottle
bought
from
the
brewery
pours
the
darkest
of
reds
with
a
little
bit
of
foam
in
the
duvel
glass
this
bottle
says
its
12
5
and
its
so
god
damn
smooth
i
am
finding
no
hint
of
the
alc
in
this
at
all
the
taste
is
wonderful
hard
to
explain
but
i
fucking
love
it
its
got
a
mixture
of
dark
fruit
and
dark
malt
to
the
taste
but
there
is
something
else
that
i
cant
figure
out
how
to
explain
but
i
am
really
digging
this
beer
fantastic
beverage
it
is
good
but
nothing
really
distinguishes
it
very
mellow
nice
bythefire
sipper
and
i
like
that
it
has
a
bit
of
oxidation
to
it
incredible
the
heat
becomes
apparent
on
warming
but
definitely
within
reason
alcohol
stays
masked
behind
everything
exquisite
d
a
great
beer
but
most
assuredly
a
sipper
this
is
classified
as
an
old
ale
but
you
could
have
told
me
english
barleywine
and
i
would
have
believed
you
it
fits
both
categories
well
all
in
all
integrated
and
complex
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
despite
the
heavy
character
good
stuff
im
going
back
to
the
store
for
more
of
this
tomorrow
a
hope
they
have
a
few
bottles
left
2008
vintage
this
poured
a
hazy
reddish
mahogany
with
lots
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
earthy
cocoa
and
musty
roasted
barley
with
some
coffee
and
cream
and
molasses
it
tasted
like
super
sweet
prunes
and
molasses
and
raisins
with
some
honey
wheat
and
rich
brown
sugar
this
is
the
definition
of
cloying
sweetness
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
strange
scent
for
an
old
ale
with
a
powerful
taste
that
wasnt
very
complex
but
instead
just
a
barrage
of
sweet
dark
fruits
it
had
good
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
fairly
well
but
this
really
needs
to
be
sipped
due
to
all
the
sugar
a
decent
beer
but
not
really
one
of
my
favorite
old
ales
taste
is
awesome2008
vintage
btw
very
sweet
with
caramel
sugars
malts
booze
tangy
creamy
wow
what
a
great
brew
a
little
thick
so
hard
to
put
more
than
one
down
in
a
tasting
yummy
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
will
age
well
fro
years
to
come
this
beer
smells
so
good
a
heavily
roasted
hazlenut
and
caramel
matched
with
vanilla
alludes
to
this
beers
depth
and
complexity
as
trey
pointed
out
there
is
a
nice
funky
element
that
was
present
in
kuhnhenns
triple
bock
this
beer
is
just
as
enjoyable
in
the
taste
so
smooth
yet
highly
carbonated
the
roasted
flavors
carry
well
and
really
take
this
beer
to
the
next
level
ill
file
this
beer
under
incredible
beers
that
i
will
never
get
to
try
again
overall
this
was
the
perfect
beer
for
a
cold
pa
night
thanks
derek
o
pretty
good
solid
beer
but
not
mindblowing
or
something
to
drink
all
the
time
not
sure
if
the
age
helps
or
hurts
this
beer
there
just
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
coming
out
of
it
for
me

some

throwing
off
fruity

in
the
aroma
something
rich
and
earthy
underneath
a
sticky
sweet
caramel
toffee
that
carries
over
to
the
taste
very
rich
and
boozy
yet
this
is
my
favorite
vintage
so
far
in
terms
of
balance
a
warm
blanket
of
dried
fruits
and
rich
maltiness
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
integrated
by
now
you
know
this
is
a
slow
sipper
more
than
one
and
youll
be
on
the
floor
also
cigarworthy
if
thats
your
thing
overall
this
beer
particularly
this
vintage
is
just
ridiculous
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
have
2007
kuhnhenn
fourth
dementia
send
them
to
me
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
very
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
huge
presenting
brown
sugar
butter
chocolate
and
leather
mama
mia
this
beer
smells
great
flavors
on
the
palate
replicate
the
nose
and
im
impressed
by
how
incredibly
rich
tasting
and
intense
the
flavor
profile
is
furthermore
despite
considerable
sweetness
this
beer
was
not
the
least
bit
heavy
cloying
or
tiring
on
the
palate
i
get
some
slight
woodiness
on
the
finish
which
only
adds
to
the
extremely
long
and
smooth
finish
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
is
not
intrusive
in
any
way
still
this
is
clearly
a
sipper
and
one
is
all
i
can
ever
imagine
having
of
this
fine
beer
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
flavorful
very
big
and
very
fine
beer
excellent
stuff
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
if
old
ales
and
barleywines
are
your
thing
you
will
definitely
love
this
one
great
sweet
flavors
and
incredible
potential
for
cellaring
would
love
to
get
ahold
of
a
couple
more
of
these
to
put
some
time
on
an
excellent
beer
d
drinkability
is
good
going
into
this
one
i
was
expecting
a
big
strong
brew
and
my
expectations
were
well
exceeded
this
one
is
a
sipper
but
the
complexity
is
there
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
another
sip
and
another
sip
i
would
say
the
alcohol
could
be
dialed
back
a
bit
but
it
does
seem
to
work
pretty
well
with
the
other
big
flavors
that
are
going
on
here
could
i
have
more
than
one
probably
not
would
i
get
this
again
definitely
im
glad
to
try
this
but
its
not
of
the
same
caliber
as
a
thomas
hardys
or
old
stock
the
sweetness
is
just
way
out
of
line
and
torpedoes
some
of
the
finer
flavours
lurking
underneath
perhaps
time
would
fix
this
one
this
one
is
too
sweet
for
me
you
can
almost
feel
the
sugar
moving
between
your
teeth
that
said
it
hides
the
alcohol
really
well
and
if
you
dig
the
really
sweet
brews
this
one
would
be
sneaky
dangerous
i
found
it
all
a
little
messy
not
enough
room
for
the
individual
flavors
to
shine
through
just
too
sweet
thanks
again
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
eric
burnt
amber
color
with
minimal
head
spotty
lacing
smells
like
vanilla
custard
toffee
fig
taste
is
more
dark
fruit
raisin
followed
by
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
finishes
with
some
alcohol
bitterness
creamy
mouth
coating
medium
to
low
carbonation
alcohol
bitterness
knocks
down
mouthfeel
a
notch
fairly
drinkable
for
almost
12
abv
i
had
about
3
5oz
in
my
serving
and
i
was
sated
fantastic
stuff
and
would
love
to
spend
90
minutes
with
a
full
12oz
one
day
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
deserving
of
its
praise
it
reminded
me
of
the
first
time
i
ever
had
an
ayinger
celebrator
dopplebock
and
how
that
changed
the
way
i
saw
that
style
while
i
cannot
say
i
could
or
would
want
to
session
this
beer
it
was
very
drinkable
for
such
a
huge
abv
would
make
a
perfect
cold
weather
sipper
or
nightcap
anytime
of
the
year
i
have
already
noticed
that
the
nose
on
this
09
is
far
superior
to
my
original
review
this
is
a
huge
blast
of
alcohol
heat
raisins
and
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
actually
more
subtle
in
this
edition
but
it
maintains
all
of
its
original
complexity
and
actually
may
provide
for
an
even
more
drinkable
experience
the
body
is
still
full
and
damn
near
perfect
for
an
old
ale
the
alcohol
may
be
a
bit
too
fusel
for
some
people
but
i
think
that
this
09
release
will
age
absolutely
fantastically
for
years
to
come
i
have
now
changed
my
rating
by
bumping
up
the
smell
and
dropping
the
taste
and
drinkability
a
half
a
point
because
of
the
booziness
d
a
monster
of
an
old
ale
very
interesting
md
its
carbonated
very
well
the
sheet
of
head
still
hasnt
left
after
10
minutes
i
kind
of
like
this
more
than
the
thicker
old
ales
it
still
coats
the
mouth
very
well
and
makes
it
easier
to
drink
all
by
myself
a
great
nightcap
easily
one
of
the
best
sippers
out
there
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
a
very
tart
mix
of
cherries
and
currants
with
only
the
slight
twinge
of
alcohol
slightly
sour
but
also
slightly
sweet
very
well
put
together
with
really
almost
no
alcohol
burn
a
delicious
slow
sipping
dessertstyle
beer
this
brew
poured
a
deep
redmahogany
color
w
a
one
finger
beige
head
the
lacing
on
this
one
was
heavy
and
of
small
bubbles
that
diminished
quickly
and
left
a
light
film
hanging
on
the
glass
for
the
remainder
of
the
tasting
at
first
glance
i
thought
it
had
more
the
appearance
of
a
belgian
quad
than
an
old
ale
and
seemed
a
little
thin
but
i
was
definately
wrong
the
nose
was
of
tobacco
dates
figs
and
raisins
the
taste
basically
matched
the
nose
dried
fruits
up
front
and
a
finish
of
tobacco
slight
hop
bitterness
booze
and
that
prototypical
old
ale
basement
mustiness
as
for
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
being
an
english
barleywine
man
and
the
12
abv
was
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
simply
amazing
the
brew
was
thick
creamy
chewy
but
finished
relatively
clean
due
to
the
high
abv
overall
this
hands
down
was
one
of
if
not
the
best
old
ales
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
despite
the
initial
out
of
style
appearance
a
fantastic
old
ale
with
tons
of
depth
and
complexity
its
11
8
comes
in
a
very
manageable
12ounce
bottle
which
was
a
good
call
on
kuhnhenns
part
even
though
this
is
my
only
bottle
ill
remember
its
personality
for
a
long
time
an
exceptional
and
very
very
special
beer
any
way
you
look
at
it
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
recent
memory
hv
d
i
split
a
12oz
bottle
with
two
other
people
probably
ended
up
with
5oz
at
most
and
yet
it
seemed
like
the
perfect
serving
size
its
just
so
rich
and
boozy
definitely
a
slow
sipper
and
perfect
as
a
dessert
beer
or
a
night
cap
man
this
stuff
is
good
starts
off
with
a
thick
sweetness
of
dark
raspberry
and
toffee
before
quickly
giving
way
to
earthy
chocolate
nibs
and
a
touch
of
oxidation
the
9
5
abv
is
hidden
very
well
as
a
kiss
of
raisin
rum
lingers
on
the
finish
with
some
musty
hops
creamy
velvetysmooth
mouthfeel
to
the
thick
body
and
the
carbonation
level
is
spoton
i
hope
old
age
is
like
this
old
ale
that
way
id
look
forward
to
getting
4th
dementia
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
awesome
stuff
major
props
to
crazynelson
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
bottle
of
this
man
this
is
good
a
fine
pick
for
review
1200
thanks
nelson
pouring
this
into
my
generic
snifter
it
produced
a
ton
of
head
half
the
glass
filled
with
an
off
white
tight
bubbled
foam
once
the
head
subsided
aromas
of
raisin
pear
and
yeast
rose
to
meet
me
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
over
11
only
a
slight
amount
of
alcohol
can
be
detected
they
also
covered
the
alcohol
well
in
the
taste
flavors
of
port
more
raisin
notes
fresh
apples
and
there
was
a
very
slight
bit
of
smoke
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
spicy
sharp
bite
on
the
taste
buds
and
pleasant
lingering
after
taste
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
and
presents
complex
flavors
in
every
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
as
the
sugars
in
the
taste
lead
me
to
expect
a
sticky
feeling
but
its
not
actually
there
moderately
full
coats
the
mouth
without
being
sticky
sugary
this
is
a
bountiful
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
but
not
a
repeat
performer
in
one
session
id
definitely
look
for
this
on
a
winter
evening
drinkability
well
considering
im
not
a
huge
old
ale
fan
i
did
really
enjoy
this
brew
it
took
me
quite
awhile
to
finish
this
brew
but
i
did
enjoy
the
heck
out
of
it
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
choices
tasty
stuff
good
beer
for
after
dinner
cigar
a
whole
bottle
would
be
a
bit
much
this
is
a
very
nice
sipper
to
sit
back
and
savor
and
enjoy
really
like
this
beer
good
to
buy
a
sixpack
and
use
one
as
a
weekly
reward
for
putting
up
with
all
the
sht
at
work
might
be
better
to
let
this
one
age
for
a
couple
years
drinkability
finally
got
around
to
drinking
this
after
aquiring
this
in
05
great
and
easy

d
id
drink
this
again
this
is
my
first
old
ale
so
im
intrigued
to
try
more
d
for
the
abv
this
is
pretty
drinkable
some
age
has
done
this
well
im
impressed
d
good
considering
the
abv
definitely
a
sipper
md
this
is
a
very
complex
and
flavorful
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
that
each
sample
seems
different
not
one
for
an
every
day
beer
but
really
nice
treat
once
in
a
while
as
far
as
kuhnhenn
goes
this
is
one
of
thier
dryer
offerings
while
it
has
plenty
of
residuals
and
a
whallop
of
malt
with
an
extract
nod
it
remains
balanced
for
an
old
ale
where
its
lacking
though
is
the
straight
up
vineousity
thats
an
integral
part
of
the
style
pours
brown
with
some
nice
reddish
hues
theres
a
ring
of
dirty
white
foam
around
the
edge
bold
nose
with
cherry
pits
werthers
candies
tootsie
rolls
and
a
bit
of
chewing
tobacco
the
flavor
is
rich
with
chocolate
and
chew
if
they
actually
made
chewing
tobacco
that
tastes
like
this
i
made
pick
it
up
again
full
body
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
finish
very
yummy
stuff
drinkability
this
is
one
big
bold
beer
flavorful
and
intense
id
love
to
try
a
whole
bottle
of
this
one
sometime
and
so
it
shall
remain
on
my
wants
but
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
portion
thanks
to
a
very
generous
fellow
beer
advocate
perhaps
not
a
ba
we
were
in
mixed
website
company
after
all
a
truly
tasty
and
wellmade
beer
and
though
i
have
to
knock
it
down
a
few
points
on
drinkability
due
to
the
12
abv
not
the
9
5
listed
here
though
i
know
kuhnhenn
does
change
its
abvs
constantly
i
cant
in
good
faith
knock
it
down
too
far
its
just
too
good
drinkability
i
know
old
ales
arent
supposed
to
be
easy
to
throw
back
but
this
one
posed
an
exceptional
challenge
for
me
i
drank
it
very
slowly
over
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
and
it
was
only
a
10oz
pour
dont
get
me
wrong
i
enjoyed
taking
it
slow
and
noticing
different
things
in
the
beer
as
it
warmed
but
its
definitely
a
good
beer
to
limit
to
one
in
a
session
update
after
my
review
i
found
out
that
the
vintage
was
2008
so
this
one
is
still
pretty
hot
and
could
use
some
time
to
age
will
seek
another
one
and
properly
age
it
and
rereview
not
bad
but
definitely
not
the
beer
i
was
expecting
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
would
try
a
younger
version
if
one
every
falls
into
my
lap
full
complex
body
with
dialed
carbonation
and
the
flavor
of
an
old
ale
like
no
other
very
unique
indeed
would
love
to
try
this
with
even
more
age
on
it
and
will
seek
it
in
the
future
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
try
it
i
think
this
would
age
particularly
well
st
this
is
where
fourth
dementia
shines
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
had
sweet
dark
fruits
and
rich
maltiness
not
much
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
i
was
also
getting
a
little
evergreen
not
piney
hopsstyle
evergreen
but
a
pleasant
hint
of
spruce
or
something
whatever
it
was
this
is
great
wish
it
was
more
accessible
very
easy
drinking
and
an
enjoyable
experience

a
beer
to
contemplate
only
a

booziness
just
a
little
bit
thin
yet
well
done
but
a
bit
dissappointed
considering
this
is
so
highly
thought
of
well
see
how
the
other
5
of
these
age
i
have
a
feeling
it
will
improve

an
enjoyable
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
hoppymeal
having
not
liked
many
old
ales
that
much
that
ive
tried
this
one
really
blew
me
away
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
wonderful
beer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
stuck
around
for
the
entire
tasting
the
aroma
was
big
of
malt
and
caramel
very
inviting
the
taste
was
also
malt
it
was
complex
with
notes
of
deep
plumb
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
lush
this
is
a
heavy
brew
a
delicious
sipper
that
id
love
to
try
again
thanks
dan
for
the
fantastic
trade
overall
one
timer
d
great
sipper
and
drinks
relatively
easy
for
an
old
ale
fourth
dementias
a
nice
beer
id
like
to
try
one
fresh
just
to
see
how
it
compares
frankly
the
nose
could
use
a
little
more
strength
and
thickening
it
up
would
improve
it
to
some
degree
but
its
a
very
good
beer
as
it
is
im
certainly
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
it
thanks
derek
notes
from
122406
my
first
sampling
of
fourth
dementia
was
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
it
was
fantastic
and
this
one
isnt
far
behind
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
sampled
to
date
thanks
for
the
bottle
derek
notes
this
is
a
fine
brew
but
ola
dubh
16
and
adam
are
both
a
little
better
from
the
bottle
fourth
dementia
is
a
bit
better
on
tap
d
for
the
style
very
drinkable
an
inch
and
a
half
of
stryfoam
like
fuzzy
deep
tan
head
has
excellent
retention
body
is
a
super
dark
almost
black
brown
in
color
huge
notes
of
bourbon
molasses
vanilla
and
hot
buttered
toffee
like
malt
are
very
attractive
on
the
nose
enters
the
mouth
with
some
initially
soured
dark
fruit
but
that
quickly
yeilds
to
a
rich
carmalized
maltieness
you
get
some
biscuity
notes
along
with
phelonic
notes
including
vanilla
toffee
and
crisp
candied
peanut
butter
dark
berries
are
met
with
some
hop
based
bitter
at
the
end
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
of
dark
fruit
and
a
nice
bitter
feel
it
is
a
joy
to
drink
this
big
sipper
of
a
brew
d
very
nice
but
the
intensity
of
the
sugars
alcohol
make
each
sip
a
lot
to
handle
d
not
so
great
too
much
going
on
that
doesnt
mesh
well
fourth
dementia
is
likely
a
decent
sipper
for
a
cold
night
but
i
also
bet
it
improves
greatly
with
a
couple
years
not
overly
drinkable
simply
because
of
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
highly
recommended
though
cheers
to
grub
drjay
and
hoppymeal
for
the
chance
to
try
these
on
three
occasions
alright
in
not
one
to
review
from
but
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
it
came
a
copper
red
with
a
solid
head
of
tan
color
that
stuck
around
with
solid
retention
extremely
malty
and
very
thick
but
not
overwhelming
for
the
consumer
who
understands
what
they
are
getting
into
thick
creamy
very
full
bodied
had
a
very
strong
lingering
character
on
the
tongue
and
an
extreme
maltiness
as
stated
above
very
thick
and
creamy
slight
fruit
notes
to
it
heavy
actually
pretty
smooth
and
very
tasty
taste
earthy
hops
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
followed
by
bitterness
and
a
warming
alcohol
finish
syrupy
and
heavy
the
body
is
surprisingly
firm
though
and
while
this
is
a
sipper
it
still
goes
down
like
gold
overall
a
very
fine
beer
but
maybe
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
d
sip
slowly
my
friend
cause
this
one
will
dump
a
whole
can
of
whoop
ass
on
you
if
not
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
gladly
have
more
in
fact
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
this
is
a
cold
evening
warmer
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
though
the
syrupy
sweet
mouthfeel
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
slightly
still
very
nice
d
this
beer
has
a
great
bold
flavor
of
malt
with
some
interesting
malt
flavors
to
it
and
a
nice
hop
support
the
depth
seems
to
unveil
itself
as
the
beer
warms
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
i
would
be
interested
to
see
what
this
beer
taste
like
as
it
ages
becuase
the
hops
add
so
much
to
it
fresh
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
very
thin
head
the
nose
is
quite
expressive
with
scents
of
toffee
caramel
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
palate
is
not
quite
as
dense
as
i
would
expect
based
on
the
nose
it
is
wellbalanced
and
comes
off
feeling
light
even
though
it
is
a
heavy
beer
while
this
should
age
well
im
not
sure
how
it
will
change
as
the
flavors
already
those
that
i
associate
with
aged
beer
this
vintage
seems
fruitier
and
sweeter
both
on
the
nose
and
the
palate
with
brown
sugar
prunes
raisins
and
maybe
some
dates
less
leather
less
tobacco
this
does
remind
me
of
the
bb
4d
lighter
in
body
making
this
extremely
drinkable
still
excellent

old
ales
are
not
a
style
i
particularly
seek
out
or
crave
but
this
is
one
tasty
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
im
glad
i
at
least
have
one
more
bottle
bottle
courtesy
of
kryptic
poured
a
cloudy
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
small
head
with
minimal
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
dry
fruit
characteristics
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
malt
notes
with
some
dry
fruits
plums
figs
full
body
with
limited
filtration
and
some
low
carbonation
no
alcohol
was
discernable
which
is
quiet
a
feta
considering
the
abv
in
this
beer
not
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
but
very
good
nonetheless
a
great
late
night
sipper
for
sure
notes
thanks
to
dyan
for
sharing
this
one
this
typically
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
definitely
won
me
over
d
hands
down
the
best
old
ale
i
have
tried
a
very
nice
sipper
overall
fourth
dementia
is
a
complex
brew
that
drinks
more
like
a
sherry
or
a
liqueur
it
is
potent
and
forces
you
to
respect
that
while
remaining
enjoyable
i
can
imagine
sipping
this
on
a
cold
new
england
evening
in
front
of
a
fire
now
if
only
i
had
a
fireplace
this
might
sound
like
heresy
but
fourth
dementia
made
me
think
of
my
experience
limited
though
it
may
be
with
sam
adams
utopias
not
the
mouthfeel
perse
but
the
flavor
profiles
are
very
similar
i
wouldnt
necessarily
say
that
the
kuhnhenn
is
as
good
however
i
would
say
that
if
you
want
a
hint
of
what
can
be
found
in
a
bottle
of
utopias
try
fourth
dimension
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
to
see
if
its
up
your
alley
second
beer
from
kuhnhenn
and
it
was
great
like
the
first
one
would
love
to
try
the
bourbon
barrel
version
of
this
one
of
the
better
olde
ales
i
have
ever
had
would
love
to
drink
again
highly
recommended
pours
a
deep
brown
with
an
amber
outline
two
fingers
of
tan
head
top
this
beer
that
dies
down
to
a
creamy
layer
leaving
some
nice
webbing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
ripe
dark
fruits
and
oak
very
interesting
merlot
aroma
not
strong
and
very
pleasant
rich
caramel
thick
molasses
and
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
nose
as
well
raisins
and
fig
on
the
tongue
first
followed
by
an
interesting
piney
hop
flavor
winey
oak
and
dark
cherries
with
some
booze
towards
the
end
aftertaste
is
somewhat
dry
with
hints
of
dates
and
brandy
lots
of
malt
throughout
but
hops
are
there
too
medium
to
full
body
with
a
rich
and
creamy
feel
carbonation
is
light
but
complements
the
mouthfeel
so
well
the
alcohol
is
there
so
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
very
complex
flavors
interested
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
to
this
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
and
so
good
on
many
levels
a
must
try
d
very
good
old
ale
but
most
definitely
not
a
session
beer
i
wish
i
had
shared
it
with
a
friend
12oz
too
much
for
me
this
is
one
to
enjoy
in
small
amounts
on
a
cold
winters
night
imo
d
this
was
quite
tasty
but
it
want
the
best
old
ale
ive
tried
thanks
to
goryshkewych
for
this
one
drinkability
well
that
was
quite
a
lovely
old
ale
i
definitely
recommend
acquiring
a
bottle
or
three
overall
i
do
not
know
what
else
i
can
really
say
about
this
one
it
was
to
be
it
in
context
not
only
the
single
best
old
ale
i
have
ever
had
this
may
honestly
be
my
favorite
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
was
just
that
good
it
is
everything
you
want
in
a
late
night
sipper
to
me
it
was
just
perfect
i
could
not
think
of
another
thing
that
could
be
done
you
must
get
this
and
send
it
to
me
i
have
to
have
this
one
again
fantastic
in
every
way
thanks
very
much
to
weisguy
for
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
close
to
black
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
to
a
very
thin
ring
smells
of
licorice
and
blackstrap
molasses
slightly
treacly
and
herbal
but
not
sweet
the
taste
starts
with
more
of
that
european
style
licorice
flavor
not
sweet
but
more
earthy
and
bitter
in
fact
a
deeply
herbal
bitterness
is
present
in
this
beer
like
fernet
branca
to
me
that
is
delicious
but
be
prepared
for
the
amaro
like
bitterness
more
blackstrap
on
the
finish
complex
and
delicious
low
carbonation
and
a
tiny
bit
sticky
in
the
mouthfeel
but
still
reasonable
very
interesting
i
like
this
a
lot
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
particularly
balanced
beer
one
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
chewy
body
nice
alcohol
warmth
and
a
sweet
finish
a
tasty
treat
but
a
little
dry
for
the
style
this
was
a
long
sought
after
beer
for
me
and
it
did
not
disappoint
serving
type
ontap
very
very
good
cheers
mouthfeel
is
viscous
and
a
bit
slick
from
the
sweetness
not
as
heavy
as
i
was
expecting
mellow
carbonation
that
works
well
with
the
overall
brew
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
one
bottle
does
the
job
in
a
sitting
and
this
would
make
a
good
apertif
this
is
another
tasty
kuhnhenn
brew
that
is
worth
seeking
out
this
bottle
was
brewed
on
8104
and
still
holding
up
quite
well
tasty
contemplative
and
interesting
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
close
to
peaking
when
younger
i
think
it
would
have
been
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
the
oxidation
has
started
to
temper
this
brew
the
still
noticeable
hop
character
adds
a
nice
balance
to
the
rich
layered
malt
character
not
bad
but
something
seems
to
keep
this
from
being
great
perhaps
it
is
a
lack
of
a
certain
rich
complexity
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
better
than
a
full
finger
foamy
light
tan
head
leaving
sheets
of
lacing
in
its
wake
the
smell
is
amazing
an
aggressive
dark
fruit
fig
and
sweet
molasses
aroma
im
really
taken
in
by
the
smell
to
the
point
of
distraction
maybe
i
ought
to
take
a
mouthful
wow
what
a
kick
in
the
pants
the
mouth
feel
is
first
very
creamy
and
medium
large
bodied
the
fig
of
the
nose
comes
through
really
strong
in
the
flavor
then
its
overwhelmed
by
an
intense
molasses
taste
quite
sweet
the
9
5
abv
is
warming
to
be
sure
im
not
finding
that
level
of
alcohol
distracting
im
assessing
the
weight
to
be
something
that
i
wouldnt
session
if
i
had
a
frig
full
of
them
which
i
dont
but
i
find
it
a
cinch
to
drink
and
im
savoring
the
balance
as
best
i
can
lightly
carbonated
there
is
plenty
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
on
subsequent
mouthfuls
and
the
dark
fruit
character
is
lingering
nicely
this
one
is
unique
and
imaginative
to
be
sure
bravothanks
a
lot
for
the
trade
matt
d
this
was
such
a
delight
to
drink
it
is
almost
indescribable
i
definitely
would
not
be
in
the
mood
for
this
all
the
time
but
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
can
think
of
nothing
better
d
not
bad
at
all
at
a
recent
barleywine
tasting
i
ended
up
thinking
a
lot
of
them
tasted
like
old
ales
this
beer
has
confirmed
my
suspicions
it
pretty
much
defines
the
style
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
a
ton
of
though
another
big
thank
you
to
hoppymeal
for
another
great
beer
from
kuhnhenn
i
could
barely
finish
this
one
with
the
vineous
grape
and
cherry
flavors
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
just
not
my
thing
but
very
complex
well
off
to
enjoy
the
rest
good
work
kuhnhenn
one
helluva
brew
there
bottle
picked
up
for
my
by
kkulacki
thanks
konrad
at
the
winter
solstice
party
pours
deep
blood
red
and
dark
with
a
short
white
head
and
big
long
lacing
smells
like
cherry
cough
syrup
blackberries
hazlenut
hints
of
coffee
ethanol
strong
malts
a
pretty
amazing
comehither
odor
the
flavor
is
cough
syrupforward
with
hints
of
cherries
body
and
finish
are
a
much
more
inviting
bland
of
cherry
and
chocolate
with
smokey
almost
milky
malts
alcohol
storng
but
not
overpowering
some
phenolic
qualities
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
trends
towards
a
beer
liquor
comparison
to
cough
syrup
hard
to
shed
and
i
wish
that
flavor
were
less
pronounced
thick
and
fullbodied
sticky
and
lipsmacking
almost
chewy
overall
its
a
great
beer
crazy
and
expertly
crafted
the
flavor
is
not
as
refined
as
i
remember
it
being
from
tastes
in
the
past
but
i
think
perhaps
its
just
too
young
luckily
i
have
a
second
botttle
which
will
be
aged

mos
ontap
at
tylers
in
durham
funny
this
makes
4
out
of
5
reviews
of
this
beer
now
that
state
that
served
in
a
kuhnhenn
tulip
a
nice
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
and
left
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
burnt
caramel
the
taste
was
a
wonderfully
complex
blend
of
dried
fruits
burnt
caramel
molasses
and
loads
of
barley
the
beer
is
very
heavy
but
gets
much
smoother
as
it
warms
more
taste
comes
out
as
well
this
one
is
certainly
a
sipper
this
was
an
extremely
wonderful
beer
but
its
certainly
a
sipper
im
just
hoping
we
see
bottles
of
it
here
in
nc
velvety
but
with
a
distinct
tanginess
moderate
carbonation
cleans
up
the
finish
a
bit
some
nice
warmth
in
the
finish
great
stuff
lots
of
elements
at
play
i
certainly
suggest
you
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
i
really
need
to
have
another
glass
of
this
before
it
disappears
this
is
a
rotating
tap
at
tylers
soon
to
be
replaced
with
creme
brulee
java
stout
by
the
same
brewer
enjoy
but
sip
and
take
it
easy
im
not
a
big
fan
of
old
ales
but
this
beer
is
really
amazing
and
very
much
worthy
of
the
high
reviews
heres
to
hoping
kuhnhenn
releases
some
more
bottles
at
the
upcoming
release
party
so
more
bas
can
enjoy
this
brew
pours
out
a
muddy
mohogany
with
a
ruby
hue
big
creamy
head
that
dies
quick
to
a
thin
layer
with
full
sheets
of
lace
throughout
smell
is
very
sweet
and
creamy
dried
dark
fruit
plumb
fig
cherry
some
raspberry
toffee
and
caramel
taste
starts
a
little
syrupy
with
the
fruits
showing
then
the
caramel
and
toffee
shine
through
then
take
over
the
palate
finishes
a
little
dry
creamy
thick
and
smooth
as
silk
in
the
mouth
a
definite
sipper
with
its
abv
that
serves
as
a
treat
but
no
more
than
one
per
sitting
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
thanks
to
faro
for
this
beer
although
not
my
favorite
style
i
do
like
to
have
one
every
not
and
again
this
one
is
good
in
many
ways
4th
dimension
is
much
more
like
a
cordial
or
after
dinner
liquor
than
a
beer
its
viscosity
appears
as
such
and
its
booziness
is
so
forthright
rich
and
fiery
in
powerful
ways
the
appearance
is
quite
pleasing

a
deep
crimson
tinged
ruby
body
truly
a
unique
and
brilliant
color
lacing
is
minimal
to
say
the
least
but
thats
highly
forgivable
in
such
a
large
beer
fruity
alcohol
aromas
dominate
the
nose
raspberry
mulberry
and
cherry
then
toffee
and
biscuits
come
into
play
and
finally
the
whole
endeavor
is
finished
with
tobacco
and
rounded
out
with
vanilla
the
flavor
doesnt
diverge
much
from
the
nose
dark
fruits
rule
here
as
well
mostly
berries
but
also
some
plum
and
raison
toffee
is
also
a
large
component
herbal
boozy
finish
not
drinkable
in
large
quantities
a
real
after
dinner
sort
of
sipper
and
quite
the
well
rounded
hyper
warming
fun
big
beer
i
would
really
like
a
growler
or
two
of
this
around
christmas
to
sip
on
while
sitting
around
the
fire
not
really
sure
how
something
like
this
could
be
improved
im
a
certified
hop
head
but
this
malt
bomb
was
one
of
the
most
delicious
beers
ive
ever
drank
it
was
presented
in
a
tulipstyle
chalice
showcasing
the
dark
aubrun
red
beer
with
a
thick
wet
and
sticky
tan
head
very
nice
looking
and
the
aroma
wasnt
as
strong
or
barleywiney
as
i
feared
it
was
malty
and
a
little
muted
still
very
nice
the
taste
was
almost
doppelbocky
with
rich
and
sweet
malt
flavors
battling
for
dominance
over
the
alcohol
13

based
on
the
menu
description
the
malt
flavors
came
through
really
nicely
and
there
was
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
burn
the
mouthfeel
was
just
as
good
thick
and
chewy
it
felt
like
drinking
a
meal
very
very
nice
old
ale
the
new
menu
has
this
beer
at
13
5
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
warms
the
heart
and
soul
i
love
it
the
level
of
sweetness
is
high
and
the
boozey
sherry
character
is
a
key
player
in
this
beer
certainly
a
sipper
not
something
that
i
could
drink
more
than
a
glass
of
in
a
sitting
but
very
enjoyable
none
the
less
d
it
is
a
big
sipper
but
its
a
great
beer
im
glad
i
opened
it
for
my
400th
review
very
complex
and
interesting
flavors
i
would
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
is
excellent
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
something
i
feel
like
i
could
sip
on
all
day
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
alcohol
with
minimal
hop
presence
just
the
way
an
old
ale
should
be
another
world
class
beer
from
kuhnhenn
the
bite
is
a
bit
more
than
i
would
prefer
in
an
aged
old
ale
barleywine
id
be
curious
to
see
what
a
few
more
years
would
do
but
other
than
that
id
look
to
other
brews
to
fortify
the
cellar
nonetheless
it
is
quite
pleasant
and
wellcrafted
ill
take
a
bottle
of
infected
creme
brulee
over
this
travesty
any
day
poured
into
a
chalice
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
amber
color
some
carbonation
no
head
or
lacing
the
nose
is
of
sweetspicy
malts
some
hops
slight
vanilla
and
caramel
the
taste
is
big
of
sweet
malts
hops
and
caramel
theres
a
nice
oilysweetness
going
on
with
first
sip
then
theres
a
slight
drybitterness
in
the
finish
nice
warming
factor
the
whole
way
down
medium
body
nice
rounded
brew
very
drinkable
but
watch
out
lol
this
is
a
very
tasty
old
ale
hopefully
i
will
get
a
chance
to
try
out
other
kuhnhenn
brews
soon
thanks

at
all
very
murky
cloudy
also
raisin
toffee
caramel
and
a
spot
of
alcohol
in
the

basically
a
lot
of
malt
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
rich
caramel
and
coffee
lightly
smoked
dark
raspberry
and
cherry
the
finish
carries
a
light
buttery
sweetness
but
also
some
hop
tang
creating
some
bitter
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
but
the
syrupy
thickness
gives
it
some
depth
still
overall
this
was
a
malt
bomb
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
it
younger
although
i
suspect
many
of
you
would
enjoy
it
just
fine
as
is
worth
a
try
heavy
feel
with
a
gentle
carbonation
strong
raisin
and
dark

flavors
and

a

cloying

fringes
edge
towards
a
hint
of

notes
which
keep
this
from
excelling
but
the
dry

faint

are
especially
appreciated
faint
oxidation
damn
near
perfect
without
question
the
best
olde
ale
that
ive
ever
had
exremely
complex
but
still
balanced
very
syrupy
can
keep
it
in
your
mouth
forever
and
the
longer
you
wait
the
more
you
find
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
finish
accompanied
by
a
lastminute
hoppy
bitterness
it
could
be
a
desert
beer
but
there
are
so
many
layers
to
the
malt
that
you
dont
really
consider
it
a
sweet
beer
while
you
drink
it
a
thick
head
was
not
expected
for
this
style
however
it
did
seem
slightly
undercarbonated
perhaps
a
bit
more
and
the
palette
would
be
opened
up
to
dig
through
the
layers
of
flavor
as
i
continue
to
drink
this
brew
more
and
more
im
impressed
by
the
finish
the
alcohol
dries
things
out
and
the
hopcontent
thrives
d
awesome
too
strong
to
session
the
bitterness
is
of
a
type
that
detracts
from
teh
drinkability
but
it
would
be
better
with
food
if
i
ever
find
it
again
i
will
have
it
again
why
doesnt
kuhnhenn
distribute
more
this
is
the
only
kuhnhenn
beer
i
have
had
and
it
is
simply
amazing
i
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
many
more
of
their
beers
hopefully
i
can
make
it
up
to
their
brewpub
one
day
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
decent
yet
quickly
receeding
head
first
whiff

was

with
licorice

dates
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
delectable

theres
a

i
never
would
have

glad
i
bought
a

might
have
to
lay
down
some
of
those
though
to
try
next
years
mouthfeel
thick
and
chewy
and
succulently

i
could
drink
this
beer
daily
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
be
happy
great
job
from
a
great
brewery
drinkability
well
rounded

is
an
incredible

my
first
beer
from
kuhnhenn
lived
up
to
all
the
good
word
not
demented
to
say
this
is
damn
good
this
bottle
of
fourth
dementia
has
been
biding
its
time
in
my
cellar
for
over
a
year
now
given
the
best
before
2010
on
the
label
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
sample
the
goods
after
drinking
it
i
dont
believe
that
its
going
to
improve
from
here
on
out
in
the
final
reckoning
its
a
good
old
ale
but
great
never
even
crossed
my
mind
bottle
split
with
dirtylou
during
my
stay
in
madison
best
by
2010
d
would
definitely
be
able
to
enjoy
more
than
one
although
you
would
want
another
ba
near
you
way
too
many
flavors
in
this
beer
for
one
person
to
determine
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
id
like
it
to
be
a
bit
creamier
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
complex
aroma
and
taste
a
bit
hot
still
but
tolerable
good
overall
upon
its
release
the
beer
sets
in
the
glass
a
beclouded
ruby
red
with
a
personable
creamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
evaporates
leaving
an
admirable
sheet
of

has
a
bit
of
muskiness
with
sweet
malt
hints
of
caramel
delectable
this
nose
sweet
at
the
start
grain
profile
perfect
and
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
determined
acidity
the
hops
spicy
and
enjoyable
the
after
taste
dry
with
a
nice
bit
of
tummy
warming
a
total
hit
with
me
and
a
must
try
tastes
phenomenal
chocolate
brown
sugar
nutty
toffee
with
hints
of
sherry
a
bit
of
plum
fig
vanilla
and
some
caramel
woody
dry
almost
comes
across
as
oaky
but
wet
sweet
while
in
the
mouth
due
to
the
thick
body
hot
from
alcohol
but
not
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
dry
aftertaste
has
a
rough
grassy
character
that
i
think
comes
from
the
alcohol
thick
mouthfeel
with
very
modest
carbonation
this
beer
was
wonderful
as
a
snipper
i
would
eagerly
accept
another
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
must
get
my
hands
on
some
more
i
highly
recommend
it
both
come
through
in
a
hearty
syrupy
brew
maybe
some
green
hops
but
mostly
burnt
malts
here
dark
fruit
and
booze
on
the
finish
medium
to
heavy
sweet
mouthfeel

one
wanting
more

wow
kuhnhenn
knows
old
ale
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
a
deep
red
in
the

there
is

let
me

i

in

a
treat
light
bitterness
in

in

taste
but
it
is
balanced
and
overpowered
by
the
sweet
rich
malty
flavors
the
alcohol
is
so
well
balanced
it
is
barely
discernible
just
a
warming
in
the
back

the

in

a

and

unfortunately
a

but
the

is
still
extremely
delicious
pours
out
to
a
dark
red
to
almost
ruby
color
in
the
glass
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
light
liquer
the
taste
is
excellent
with
traces
of
plums
bourbon
and
molasses
coming
to
the
forefront
a
winter
warmer
for
sure
and
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
makes
you
appreciate
the
brewers
craft
i
sampled
this
at
the
brewery
and
just
had
to
take
this
home
its
too
bad
they
are
not
bottling
this
brew
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
just
a
faint
amount
of
light
can
pass
through
bright
ruby
highlights
along
the
outside
of
my
glass
absolutely
no
lacing
but
has
an
oily
syrupy
consistency
about
it
heavy
aroma
of
molasses
malt
candy
and
dark
fruits
nice
taste
very
sweet
a
combination
of
molasses
candy
and
maybe
apple
cider
it
leaves
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
slick
smooth
mouthfeel
and
finishes
slighly
dry
drinkability
is
tough
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
dont
get
me
wrong
this
brew
has
an
awesome
taste
but
after
one
glass
i
already
have
a
buzz
going
and
i
have
a
growler
of
this
stuff
looks
like
this
will
be
an
early
night
a
must
try
if
you
can
get
to
michigan
rather
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
i
probably
consumed
the
bottle
a
little
too
quickly
well
this
is
a
definate
snifter
beer
the
tighter
the
lip
on
the
glass
the
better
garnet
coloring
with
a
mild
head
that
is
gone
fast
smells
of
alcohol
right
up
front
but
there
are
a
lot
of
others
things
in
there
as
well
including
maple
dark
fruit
ripe
melon
and
apples
like
green
apples
the
taste
is
burning
from
the
start
with
the
alcohol
but
like
a
good
scotch
or
brandy
it
only
scours
the
tastes
buds
to
open
them
up
for
all
the
taste
coming
afterwards
heady
malt
complexity
with
a
slight
hint
of
char
and
raisins
there
are
some
bitter
hops
but
no
flavor
and
again
a
weird
green
apple
finish
that
i
would
call
an
of
flavoring
i
think
this
could
have
used
a
little
more
oxidation
overall
the
mouthfeel
suffers
due
to
the
high
alcohol
feel
the
taste
was
fine
but
the
burning
in
my
throat
made
it
a
little
hard
a
good
sipper
while
the
weather
is
whatever
outside
nice
and
sweet
with
lots
of
raisins
going
on
malts
are
very
mellow
and
earthy
alcohol
comes
out
at
the
end
a
bitbut
not
overly
honestly
this
beer
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
kind
of
drab
kind
of
like
when
you
realize
after
the
paint
has
dried
that
you
picked
out
the
wrong
color
for
the
walls
fine
and
drinkable
but
just
kind
of
boring
and
uninteresting
extreme
thanks

what
a

bomb
this
is
it
is
so
sweet
and
delicious
that
it
would
take
all
the
hop
heads
and
convert
them
instantly
to
malt
a
little
like
aventinus
but
not
as
bananaesque
it
is
very
close
to
a
barleywine
and
although
i
dont
care
too
much
for
barleywinesthis
thing
is
fantastic
tasting
notes
are
caramel
syrup
and
a
nice

finish
there
are
some

they
dont

mention
here

this

it
is
so
good
that
it
took
me
almost
an

half
to

you
must
let
this

warm
up

to
get

the

want
to
thank
cretemixer
for
this
treat
pours
into
a

chestnut
colored

thick
looking
the
smell
is
complex
with
a
musky
caramel
and
roast
malt
smell
taste
is
heavenly
evolves
over
a
few
minutes
from
a
smooth
somewhat
sweet
caramel
and
roast
malt
to
a
musky
and
oh
so
slightly
vaguely
herbal
flavor
with
malt
predominance
really
beautiful
in
the
mouth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
heat
it
was
easy
to
slow
down
and
enjoy
this
beer
over
an
extended
period
of
time
given
the
number
of
flavors
going
on
here
and
even
easier
to
order
another
not
necessarily
easy
to
get
off
the
stool
and
walk
home
without
stumbling
though
at
9
5
so
worth
it
though
wow
this
is
an
unbelieveable
beer
it
begins
by
pouring
a
sludgy
brownish
color
has
a
small
and
quickly
dissipating
tannish
head
overall
the
initial
appearance
is
not
as
impressive
as
could
be
however
other
attributes
more
than
make
up
for
this
shortcoming
fourth
demetia
has
a
deep
and
malty
aroma
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
are
followed
by
a
slight
hoppy
undertone
it
smells
sweet
and
full
very
nice
in
the
nose
the
taste
can
be
summed
up
by
two
words
sweetness
galore
i
can
really
distinguish
the
malt
and
caramel
in
this
beer
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
is
present
and
hangs
around
afterward
for
a
bit
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
hops
are
also
noticealbe
all
and
all
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
nice
taste
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
full
and
biting
it
is
a
very
strong
heavy
and
formidable
beer

the
tongue
overalll
k
f
d
is
a
sipper
if
there
ever
was
one
it
is
boldly
strong
and
extremely
flavorful
this
is

and
deliciously
substantial

tad
overly
sweet
and
cloying
a
hell
of
a
big
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
like
the
label
says
it
could
use
another
4
months
of
aging
but
its
enjoyable
now
that
reminds
me
of
the
old
sign
free
beer
tomorrowanother
4
months
from
when
get
some
for
now
and
later
so
i
have
sampled
a
fairly
large
number
of
beers
i
do
admit
the
stout
from
belgium
was
also
divine
pours
an
almost
opaque
deep
ruby
color
with
orangeamber
tints
around
the
edges
and
a
thick
creamy
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
beautiful
yet
sparse
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
sweet
with
some
sherry
raisin
and
molasses
notes
detected
along
with
just
a
hint
of
spiciness
from
the
hops
the
flavor
here
is
all
malt
it
is
a
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
with
just
enough
noble
hops
bitterness
to
balance
this
big
boy
out
there
are
some
hints
of
raisin
sherry
molasses
and
brown
sugar
along
with
some
alcohol
warming
this
beer
is
big
in
the
mouthfeel
department
smooth
creamy
and
chewy
all
the
way
to
the
end
the
flavors
will
linger
on
your
tongue
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
and
that
is
a
good
thing
now
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
brew
at
kuhnhenns
since
i
never
got
to
try
any
of
the
bottled
batches
and
now
i
hear
that
there
recent
bottles
of
this
are
not
doing
to
well
as
it
is
anyways
this
one
came
in
a
lovely
balloon
glass
the
colour
was
dark
bloody
redblack
but
not
quite
opaque
head
was
light
khaki
and
lasted
for
quite
a
while
providing
the
glass
with
some
lovely
lacing
patterns
as
well
aromas
are
impressive
old
ale
notes
of
raisins
figs
other
dark
fruits
and
residual
sugars
molasses
brown
sugar
etc
hops
are
leafy
and
good
in
this
mix
malts
are
dark
roasty
and
hella
complex
middle
is
doughy
and
fruit
with
a
rum
raisin
sort
of
kick
to
it
that
really
does
it
for
me
finish
is
leafy
hops
and
dark
patent
malts
with
some
caramel
hints
and
a
somewhat
wet
and
drying
contrasting
finish
that
makes
this
exceptionally
drinkable
just
a
totally
kick
ass
old
ale
from
a
brewery
that
is
really
drawing
lines
awesome
stuff
i
have
had
only
a
handful
from
this
style
and
i
can
see
why
so
many
seek
out
this
particular
brew
i
have
one
other
thanks
to
eyedrinkale
and
will
age
it
for
a
couple
years
at
that
time
this
one
will
be
up
there
w
the
likes
of
thomas
hardy
one
very
nice
old
ale
candyish
dark
silky
smooth
and
the
alcoholic
heat
is
perfect
akin
to
any
nice
brandy
port
or
sherry
out
there
yet
still
keeps
its
beery
quality
and
character
nine
years
later
and
very
smooth
spices
cola
caramel
comments

i
will
be
forever
indebted
to
garthwaite
for
sending
this
old
ale
out
to
seattle
cheers
and
beers
wow
damned
good
beer
brewed
on
08012004
drank
on
06102005
poured
out
to
a
brown
ale
color
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
nice
foamy
creamlike
head
right
off
the
bat
this
one
smells
like
raisins
with
sweet
floral
notes
mixed
in
woohoo
the
booze
is
present
in
this
one
strong
element
of
alcohol
mixed
with
fermented
fruit
flavors
and
a
toffee
like
aftertaste
went
down
too
smooth
considering
the
power
this
brew
packs
this
will
knock
you
firmly
on
your
ass
if
you
are
not
ready
for
it
hell
it
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
if
you
are
ready
for
it
i
would
imagine
as
the
brewer
recommends
this
beer
would
really
mellow
with
age
and
the
flavors
would
mature
i
plan
on
getting
a
sixer
of
this
and
letting
it
sit
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
happends
nonetheless
a
solid
winner
recommended
finger
licking
good
cheers
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
very
little
head
and
ok
retention
lacking
because
it
was
from
a
growler
most
likely
has
a
very
strong
aroma
slight
alcohol
strong
raisin
and
spice
reminds
me
a
bit
of
varnish
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
flavor
is
very
nice
lots
of
subtle
spices
and
a
great
caramel
backing
tie
in
very
well
with
the
warming
hints
of
alcohol
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
body
is
somewhere
around
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
high
level
of
alcohol
it
pours
a
nice
rubylaced
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
nicely
ring
the
top
of
the
beer
nice
color
the
nose
is
spicey
alcoholsoaked
raisins
coated
in
brown
sugar
the
spicey
alcohol
really
plays
well
in
there
smells
really
nice
the
flavor
is
very
nice
and
balanced
i
get
a
deeper
flavor
than
the
nose
suggested
dark
brown
sugar
and
raisin
with
just
a
puff
of
alcohol
and
spices
the
alcohol
is
only
slightly
present
to
let
you
know
that
it
is
there
im
a
fan
of
how
everything
plays
well
with
each
other
flavor
the
feel
is
great
with
a
very
thick
almost
syrupy
feel
it
coats
my
mouth
and
throat
as
i
swallow
the
beer
the
carbonation
is
minimal
drinkability
is
huge
i
am
very
imressed
with
this
brew
it
is
very
smooth
and
easily
drinking
a
fine
fine
beer
seek
it
drink
it
love
it
piney
citrusy
and
fruit
punch
aromas
attack
your
nose
super
smooth
and
malty
with
enough
hops
present
to
remind
you
this
is
beer
deep
rubymahogany
colors
full
and
chewy
mouthfeel
very
tasty
ale
i
want
to
drink
more
but
high
abv
prevents
that
i
really
like
this
beer
true
testament
to
how
good
it
is
i
would
drink
this
beer
warm
and
flat
flavor
is
sweet
toffee
up
front
with
some
raisins
and
brown
sugar
moving
in
behind
it
and
then
some
bitey
and
warming
alcohol
on
the
finish
a
nice
smooth
beer
that
although
it
warms
the
beer
still
goes
down
nicely
very
slightly
hazy
very
dark
ruby
red
colour
topped
by
a
light
tan
head
that
showed
very
good
retention
and
left
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
intensely
malty
aroma
with
rich
caramel
and
toffee
molasses
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
dark
ripe
fruitiness
becomes
a
deep
vinous
aroma
with
noticeable
alcohol
character
as
it
warms
malty
sweet
flavour
to
start
it
just
gets
more
and
more
complex
caramel
toffee
molasses
and
ripe
fruits
are
strongest
initially
with
a
bit
of
oak
vanilla
and
nuttiness
underneath
bitterness
comes
forward
part
way
through
and
a
very
light
hoppiness
appears
towards
the
end
but
it
remains
very
very
restrained
the
finish
is
a
combination
of
caramel
sweetness
and
warm
alcohol
flavour
full
chewy
body
that
stops
just
short
of
being
syrupy
with
moderately
low
carbonation
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
made
with
exceptional
craftsmanship
definitely
the
standout
offering
that
was
available
at
kuhnhenn
during
my
visit
overall
a
very
very
good
old
ale
something
that
i
could
definitely
have
again
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
due
to
the
low
carbonation
and
possible
numbing
effect
from
the
alcohol
way
too
strong
to
be
considered
drinkable
but
a
great
beer
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
enough
of
that
kudos
to
the
mastery
over
there
in
warren
mi
slàinte
many
thanks
go
to
ben
for
sharing
such
an
awesome
and
unique
brew
with
me
pours
out
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
strings
of
lace
were
left
coating
the
glass
and
the
head
was
revived
easily
with
a
few
swirls
of
the
snifter
upon
first
smell
of
this
brew
i
new
this
would
become
a
favorite
of
mine
there
was
just
so
much
going
on
i
knew
i
would
need
more
than
this
one
to
figure
it
all
out
smokiness
was
big
as
was
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
some
dark
fruit
and
earthywoody
notes
were
in
there
as
well
damn
there
was
so
much
going
on
i
sat
there
for
a
while
with
my
nose
just
in
the
glass
trying
to
take
it
all
in
the
taste
was
just
as
complex
and
enjoyable
as
the
aroma
dark
fruits
molasses
chocolate
malt
and
smoke
seem
to
be
the
most
upfront
flavors
an
assortment
of
other
flavors
were
present
as
well
spice
caramel
alcohol
woodiness
and
everything
else
you
could
imagine
wow
this
is
one
amazing
brew
the
full
thick
body
leaves
your
mouth
coated
in
sticky
flavor
that
seems
to
stay
with
you
forever
drinkability
is
insane
every
sip
leaves
you
wanted
more
to
discover
new
things
about
the
beer
if
this
was
available
locally
i
would
clean
the
shelves
of
it
i
guess
thats
were
the
dementia
comes
in
drinkability
is
very
good
excellent
tasty
beer
but
the
hypersweetness
makes
one
enough
poured
at
least
1015
degrees
too
cold
if
you
get
one
leave
it
on
the
bar
top
try
another
brew
and
come
back
to
it
itll
be
ready
served
on
tap
at
the
fantastic
and
unassuming
kuhnhenn
brewery
this
beer
was
highly
recommended
by
the
illustrious
venom
and
it
did
not
disappoint
the
dementia
arrived
to
us
in
a
beautiful
tulip
glass
color
is
a
deep
ruby
that
is
so
dark
its
almost
black
capped
with
a
foamy
ruddy
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
a
satisfying
lacing
for
the
duration
aroma
is
way
out
there
and
in
your
face
bold
as
can
be
plump
full
of
raisin
plum
and
oh
so
sweet
caramely
malt
body
isnt
quite
heavy
making
it
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
reasonably
potent
brew
flavor
is
complex
like
one
of
those
jigsaw
puzzles
in
which
all
the
pieces
look
alike
its
almost
indescribable
i
get
elements
of
chocolate
toffee
fermented
raisin
caramel
and
molasses
out
of
this
rich
dark
beauty
just
a
slight
drip
of
maple
syrup
as
well
phenomenal
for
sipping
or
drinking
in
moderation
youre
longing
for
more
when
the
glass
is
empty
there
is
a
nice
warmth
in
the
finish
and
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
back
and
sides
of
the
tongue
also
unveiled
are
soft
creamy
vanilla
and
woody
notes
this
brew
has
a
very
oldvintage
ale
character
for
a
beer
brewwed
this
year
a
masterful
creation
this
is
a
top
shelf
brew
do
not
miss
the
oportunity
to
enjoy
this
one
sampled
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
brew
poured
from
the
bottle
like
thick
syrup
a
deep
dark
murky
brownredpurple
with
a
slight
tan
head
which
eventually
reduced
to
a
few
constantly
swirling
bubbles
i
smelled
this
beast
of
a
brew
the
second
the
cap
came
off
as
intense
an
aroma
as
ive
ever
come
across
a
delightful
one
at
that
massive
dark
fruit
notes
are
everywhere
as
powerful
caramel
burnt
burgundy
cherries
collide
with
dulled
spicy
hops
oaken
woodiness
to
overpower
the
senses
from
the
moment
it
hit
my
lips
i
was
in
heaven
this
extremely
sweet
but
perfect
balanced
brew
overloaded
my
palate
with
pounds
of
dark
chocolate
rich
caramel
more
delicious
flavors
of
chocolate
covered
burgundy
cherries
vanilla
and
molasses
compliment
the
mild
spicy
hops
notes
of
oak
warming
alcohol
makes
its
presence
felt
from
the
start
only
adds
to
the
intense
appeal
of
this
brew
minimally
carbonated
but
extraordinarily
full
bodied
this
bad
boy
fills
coats
the
mouth
like
maple
syrup
finishes
with
some
tartness
burnt
molasses
toffee
aftertaste
lasted
for
hours
though
i
wish
it
was
days
liquid
heaven
a
surprisingly
drinkable
old
ale
id
like
to
have
another
can
you
drive
me
home
first
and
hopefully
not
last
visit
to
kuhnhenn
served
in
a
12
oz
tulip
glass
thick
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
rich
tan
head
that
settled
to
a
film
and
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
intense
aroma
dark
chocolates
peat
soy
sauce
nuts
also
very
estery
and
a
prevailent
earthy
smell
offered
a
taste
to
my
sister
says
it
tastes
like
dirt
taste
was
of
once
again
rich
bitter
chocolate
mixed
dark
fruits
nuts
and
peat
also
a
whiskey
or
bourbonlike
quality
had
to
sip
this
one
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
and
slick
alcohol
made
its
presence
known
quite
well
this
is
what
i
have
been
missing
all
these
years
a
definite
eye
opener
such
a
flavorful
brew
very
fine
work
from
those
at
kuhnhnenn
far
and
away
the
most
interesting
and
intensely
flavored
brew
i
have
had
to
date
delightful
i
am
a
disciple
of
the
kuhnhenn
way
this
is
a
brewery
that
takes
risks
and
always
issues
forth
a
fascinating
drink
independent
of
how
challenging
or
even
awkward
it
may
initially
seem
my
advice
is
to
study
these
repeatedly
sweet
sweet
beer
incredibly
deep
potent
caramel
flavors
with
bourbon
barrel
characteristics
soft
velvet
feel
quite
oily
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
though
a
flavor
that
strikes
me
as
sweetned
blackberry
puree
with
confectioners
sugar
might
simply
be
an
offshoot
of
the
alcohol
flavor
regardless
its
quite
well
put
together
i
dont
get
this
at
all
totally
flat
and
blown
away
by
a
lot
of
stuff
on
this
list
this
is
more
like
a
barleywine
less
of
an
old
ale
i
am
very
excited
to
be
able
to
try
this
it
gets
lost
in
a
sea
of
barleywines
and
stouts
but
would
stand
out
on
its
own
well
done
ruby
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
toffee
fruity
vanilla
and
light
oak
with
hints
of
molasses
and
alcohol
make
up
most
of
the
aroma
smells
quite
sweet
but
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
bits
of
caramel
and
burnt
sugars
light
vanilla
and
wood
with
some
solid
warming
alcohol
thick
body
with
a
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
great
sipper
2011
bottle
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
the
bourbon
barrel
flavors
blend
so
well
with
the
sweet
carmeltoffee
flavors
o
a
fantastic
toptier
old
ale
loads
of
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
booze
with
some
nice
fruit
undertones
its
a
lot
like
some
of
the
best
englishstyle
ba
barleywines
but
a
good
deal
sweeter
and
more
sherryforward
i
think
i
favor
4d
over
bb4d
the
regular
has
a
lot
of
the
same
aromas
and
flavors
as
bb4d
but
it
was
slightly
less
sweet
and
lacked
the
boozy
sherry
punch
that
bb4d
delivers
i
wouldve
liked
a
bit
more
bourbon
presence
for
whatever
reason
i
am
picking
up
a
lot
of
sherry
or
some
kind
of
sweet
liquer
but
im
not
complaining
i
purchased
2
4
packs
back
in
2010
enjoyed
half
and
still
have
aging
this
beer
is
a
must
have
taste
is
just
as
good
the
chocolaty
cereal
grains
are
unbelievable
the
yeast
is
there
but
not
prominent
and
the
great
depth
of
malt
is
what
drives
this
beer
to
greatness
mouthfeel
is
unsurprisingly
perfect
silky
and
thick
alcohol
is
in
check
but
prominent
and
complimentary
love
it
this
might
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
while
drinking
it
i
honestly
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on
o
this
was
awesome
and
incredibly
complex
i
only
wish
the
harsh
medicinal
and
alcohol
flavors
werent
so
pronounced
i
tasted
a
bottle
earlier
this
year
and
quite
frankly
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
bourbon
presence
i
really
cant
taste
the
difference
between
this
and
regular
4d
id
rather
stick
with
regular
4d
as
its
easier
to
obtain
and
not
quite
as
costly
2013
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
with
an
almost
nonexistent
head
bourbon
toffee
chocolate
oak
vanilla
and
caramel
sweetness
on
the
nose
very
complex
and
delicious
aroma
toffee
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
molasses
on
the
palate
smooth
with
a
little
alcohol
heat
outstanding
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
this
beer
coats
the
mouth
with
velvet
smoothness
im
not
an
expert
in
old
ales
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
i
cant
think
of
a
better
example
of
the
style
than
this
exemplary
crafted
beer
thanks
to
my
boy
lane
for
sharing
a
2012
bottle
of
this
treasure
with
me
it
pours
a
muddy
looking
chestnut
brown
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
but
tons
of
boozy
legs
the
nose
is
a
caramely
sweet
bourbon
boozy
earthy
blend
of
heaven
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
very
sticky
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
alcohol
to
thicken
this
up
the
body
is
more
akin
to
something
cloying
like
kahlua
or
baileys
more
than
most
beers
the
flavor
is
every
gorgeous
thing
that
the
nose
promises
sweet
boozy
earthy
and
rich
this
is
absolutely
outstanding
i
can
only
hope
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
to
add
to
my
cellar
othe
the
regular
4d
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
when
compared
to
other
old
ales
this
one
fell
short
right
up
my
alley
super
intense
old
ale
flavors
and
huge
but
abv
well
hidden
the
bourbon
barrel
is
strong
but
the
base
has
a
ton
complex
flavors
of
its
own
overall
this
is
a
real
treat
would
love
to
have
easy
access
to
kuhnhenn
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
in
a
12
ounce
format
the
second
best
old
ale
ive
ever
had
behind
old
stock
cellar
reserve
brandy
and
only
by
a
few
hairs
i
like
the
way
this
tastes
with
a
year
on
it
cant
help
but
wonder
when
the
sweet
spot
is
for
this
can
see
it
aging
well
for
years
to
come
the
barrel
does
this
beer
wonders
by
blunting
many
notes
and
melding
them
into
a
drippy
sweet
luscious
beer
pours
a
murky
amber
capped
by
a
very
light
beige
one
and
half
finger
creamy
head
dissipates
within
a
couple
of
minutes
but
above
average
retention
for
a
ba
brew
just
a
few
hints
of
lacing
bold
nose
deep
aroma
of
dark
fruit
oak
brown
sugar
toffee
all
capped
by
bourbon
booziness
opens
with
dark
fruit
including
black
cherries
sugar
plums
prunes
and
raisins
and
hints
of
dates
joined
by
rich
molasses
caramel
and
brown
sugar
some
nuttiness
and
biscuit
accents
midpalate
finishes
with
toasted
oak
vanilla
continued
dark
fruit
and
pleasant
bourbon
booziness
low
carbonation
syrupy
full
body
that
is
amazingly
smooth
and
velvety
with
just
a
bit
of
creaminess
this
amazing
brew
is
definitely
one
of
my
personal
favorites
one
of
if
not
the
best
ba
old
ale
available
whether
fresh
or
aged
this
ridiculously
complex
brew
delivers
im
glad
i
got
around
to
ticking
this
one
its
been
a
big
want
of
mine
for
a
while
definitely
worth
chasing
this
is
a
really
intense
experience
in
a
bottle
old
ale
barleywine
call
it
what
you
will
this
is
worth
seeking
out
and
im
glad
i
did
revisited
beautiful
barrel
aged
beer
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
balanced
with
some
bitterness
that
comes
out
mid
palate
great
old
ale
character
beautiful
sweet
barrel
influence
incredibly
rich
taste
and
body

o
wow
just
wow
i
was
a
skeptic
that
this
wouldnt
live
up
to
the
hype
but
i
was
wrong
so
complex
that
ever
drink
is
a
bit
different
some
sips
are
dominated
by
marshmallow
while
some
are
literally
just
like
eating
a
creme
brûlée
bourbon
ties
it
altogether
brilliantly
this
drinks
very
closely
to
an
english
barleywine
to
me
dark
fruits
caramel
and
hints
of
bourbon
maybe
even
a
little
vanilla
the
barrel
highlights
this
beer
the
13
5
does
not
diminish
any
of
the
flavor
top
notch
beer
as
good
as
any
bb
barleywineold
ale
ive
had
overall
a
fantastic
beer
would
love
to
find
some
more
poured
out
a
caramel
color
basically
no
head
huge
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
glass
huge
amounts
of
vanilla
toffee
caramel
burnt
sugar
toasted
coconut
and
booze
on
the
nose
taste
is
truly
superb
lots
of
vanilla
up
front
with
caramel
in
the
middle
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
end
its
a
welcomed
feeling
that
cuts
through
the
sweetness
low
carbonation
on
this
one
very
viscous
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
a
long
time
just
really
really
good
basically
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
thats
not
a
barleywine
out
there
about
as
good
as
old
ale
can
be
but
for
my
money
i
can
find
a
better
one
out
there
not
to
say
that
this
isnt
special
just
my
second
or
third
beer
from
these
guys
and
its
downright
fabulous
but
its
a
shade
below
some
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
had
its
far
too
sweet
for
my
palate
certainly
a
once
in
a
while
beer
at
most
rich
brown
sugar
liquid
with
some
yeast
floating
around
and
a
lackadaisical
than
head
that
lasts
just
a
minute
toffee
and
butterscotch
on
the
nose
like
a
sundae
with
a
ton
of
sugary
malt
and
alcohol
not
much
hops
not
much
balance
not
much
subtlety
this
is
a
sugar
and
grain
bomb
the
taste
makes
me
curious
to
try
the
non
barrel
aged
version
its
hard
to
tell
how
much
of
the
sweet
wood
and
booze
come
from
the
barrel
or
the
base
beer
its
mixed
well
but
tough
to
separate
a
side
by
side
would
be
real
cool
undoubtedly
one
of
michigans
best
products
its
just
a
little
sweeter
than
i
can
handle
and
the
alcohol
really
dominates
once
it
warms
up
some
dark
fruit
maybe
and
burnt
sugar
belgian
yeast
would
do
wonders
a
big
and
rich
brew
not
entirely
unique
but
well
executed
i
will
look
forward
to
more
kuhnhenn
beers
and
to
some
day
getting
my
hands
on
the
not
barrel
aged
version
a
great
beer
overall
but
a
tad
under
my
lofty
expectations
for
it
overall
awesome
i
truly
did
not
expect
this
much
out
of
it
but
i
now
believe
the
hype
glad
its
local
and
if
you
havent
had
it
try
it
one
of
the
most
complex
tasty
brews
ive
had
amazing
stuff
well
done
kuhnhenn
o
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
very
enjoyable
flavors
blend
nicely
with
the
barrel
treatment
for
a
13
5
beer
it
is
dangerously
smooth
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
complex
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
as
theres
a
ton
going
on
in
this
beer
be
sure
to
share
this
with
a
friend
theres
lot
to
talk
about
this
one
with
so
much
going
on
in
this
beer

that
is
incredible
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
world
class
old
ale
all
around
insane
complexity
and
balance
of
malt
and
barrel
flavors
and
dangerously
smooth
to
sip
on
considering
the
very
high
abv
unbelievably
amazing
offering
i
have
had
3
vintages
at
different
periods
this
is
a
very
extremly
over
rated
beer
it
is
however
a
decent
beer
but
i
really
dont
think
there
is
any
part
of
this
beer
that
is
over
the
top
amazing
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
everyday
shelf
beer
but
nothing
special
it
may
sound
like
i
am
being
negative
about
the
beer
but
i
do
think
again
it
is
a
decent
beer
just
not
special
o
how
have
i
not
had
this
this
beer
was
awesome
i
cant
recall
another
old
ale
which
gave
me
such
a
wow
factor
overall
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
that
hides
the
abv
masterfully
would
seek
out
and
drink
again
o
wow
an
old
ale
for
the
ages
for
sure
wish
i
could
get
this
stuff
locally
or
basically
ever
ive
had
normal
4d
which
was
quite
fruity
the
bourbon
in
this
covers
up
most
of
the
fruitiness
and
brings
in
wonderful
caramel
and
toasted
marshmallow
notes
which
i
feel
is
a
big
improvement
quite
complex
well
balanced
smooth
and
and
very
very
tasty
i
think
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
old
ale
which
was
previously
fruet
and
cuir
not
quite
as
good
as
founders
better
half
though
i
dont
think
that
maple
barrel
really
made
it
very
close
though
o
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
so
amazing
i
want
to
rate
this
badly
in
a
disguised
attempt
to
trade
for
more
of
it
but
it
deserves
better
than
that
great
winter
time
sipper
that
meshes
bourbon
and
malt
perfectly
without
being
an
over
the
top
diabetic
coma
inducing
sort
of
beer
gimme
more
goes
down
so
so
easily
very
great
barrel
aged
beer
when
the
barrel
aging
seems
to
just
mellow
everything
and
create
something
that
has
the
quality
of
a
lower
alcohol
beer
and
passes
over
the
palate
with
ease
thats
when
the
brewer
has
utilized
the
barrel
to
its
best
effect
this
is
masterful
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
beer
and
like
that
caramel
note
to
it
this
beer
is
beyond
perfect
has
some
flaws
but
most
of
is
easy
to
overlook
because
rarely
you
get
something
that
tastes
as
good
as
this
grab
a
bottle
on
me
and
enjoy
salud
this
is
probably
the
first
old
ale
that
i
have
legitimately
enjoyed
the
malt
profile
is
pretty
ridiculous
and
they
can
support
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
better
than
i
expected
this
is
great
to
sip
i
might
die
if
i
had
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
it
would
be
an
acceptable
death
im
not
usually
a
bourbon
barrel
or
old
ale
fan
but
this
is
good
complex
if
a
bit
too
sweet
i
guess
i
need
to
get
another
bottle
or
four
to
cellar
and
try
over
time
outside
of
the
booziness
this
beer
is
excellent
strong
vanilla
bourbon
and
caramel
flavours
mix
together
quite
well
here
i
could
not
drink
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
no
way
sirree
this
12oz
bottle
is
meant
to
be
shared
with
a
friend
who
likes
his
beer
sweet
and
strong
this
is
not
only
a
world
class
old
ale
but
a
world
class
beer
period
the
barrel
aging
sets
this
beer
on
an
entirely
different
level
im
glad
i
could
get
my
hands
on
one
of
these
its
a
great
beer
to
celebrate
christmas
overall
its
another
homerun
beer
for
me
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
the
only
thing
bad
about
it
is
i
cant
buy
it
local
overall
this
has
been
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
it
has
a
huge
flavor
which
is
extremely
well
executed
kuhnhenn
also
managed
to
tease
out
some
awesome
flavors
not
terribly
common
in
ba
stouts
opposed
to
this
old
ale
i
might
have
to
seek
out
more
of
this
very
very
well
done
overall
definitely
a
tasty
beer
but
not
as
nuanced
as
the
nonba
version
i
like
both
but
would
stick
with
the
nonba
version
going
forward
im
extremely
happy
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
i
dont
think
its
as
legendary
as
some
people
said
it
would
be
like
i
said
i
preferred
the
standard
11
4d
but
i
liked
it
recommended
overall
a
great
old
ale
probably
on
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
o
overall
ridiculously
drinkable
ba
old
ale
it
can
be
a
bit
sweet
at
times
but
as
soon
as
i
think
that
i
get
vanillaoakbourbon
and
remove
all
doubt
this
is
a
world
class
ba
old
ale
seek
it
out
drink
it
enjoy
sorry
but
this
should
be
used
for
cooking
and
not
drinking
clearly
this
is
just
my
opinion
as
it
sits
at
number
20
of
the
most
popular
beer
list
o
this
is
barrel
aged
perfection
for
old
ales
amazing
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
perfect
amount
of
alcohol
burn
which
could
be
from
the
18
months
of
cellaring
regardless
if
you
love
old
ales
and
ba
beers
seek
this
out
immediately
o
i
had
the
regular
4d
back
in
06best
before
11
and
it
stands
as
one
of
my
highest
rated
brews
ever
im
gonna
have
to
think
long
and
hard
on
how
to
rate
this
gem
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
flavoring
the
smack
of
bourbon
was
so
genuine
warm
inviting
and
integrated
it
seems
hard
to
imagine
the
beer
without
it
this
plays
excellently
off
the
hearty
malt
sweets
of
caramels
toffees
and
roasty
milk
chocolates
acting
as
the
unifying
feature
of
smoothness
to
blend
everything
together
the
booze
is
big
and
this
guy
does
everything
in
its
power
to
hide
that
much
in
the
same
way
that
bourbon
county
is
so
sweet
here
we
dont
come
quite
as
close
to
that
ultimate
balance
but
we
actually
are
left
a
bit
of
room
for
that
bitterness
of
not
only
booze
but
grain
as
well
to
poke
through
the
nose
is
comparatively
softer
but
inclusive
of
most
of
what
you
want
while
the
sip
is
sticky
frothy
and
robust
this
all
makes
for
an
incredibly
balanced
yet
unique
beer
that
will
leave
you
screaming
for
more
definite
up
there
on
the
top
of
my
list
d
i
only
have
the
one
i
wish
i
had
a
case
o
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
and
easily
one
of
the
better
beers
of
its
respective
style
for
such
a
high
abv
the
alcohol
was
balanced
nicely
with
the
complex
flavors
and
was
very
drinkable
although
i
shared
this
one
with
one
other
person
i
could
easily
drink
at
least
a
bottle
by
myself
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
kuhnhenn
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
this
is
my
first
barrel
aged
beer
by
them
and
it
absolutely
kicks
ass
old
ales
are
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
while
most
breweries
shy
away
from
them
kuhnhenn
embraces
them
and
makes
them
their
bitch
a
must
try
for
any
bourbon
drinkers
andor
ba
beer
seekers
overall
a
pleasure
to
sample
however
this
could
benefit
even
more
from
extended
aging
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
although
i
am
just
getting
into
the
craft
scene
this
is
most
certainly
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
gustatory
experiences
ive
had
in
my
life
i
am
very
glad
i
bought
more
than
one
of
these
beers
so
i
can
age
it
and
see
how
it
changes
over
time
truly
an
impressive
beer

sticky
rich
sweet
flavor
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
very
tasty
overall
a
very
nice
beer
top
of
the
top
in
the
style
bourbon
barrel
aged
old
ale
executed
almost
perfectly
at
13
5
abv
this
beer
is
no
slouch
and
it
deserves
to
be
slowly
sipped
heavy
oak
bourbon
sugar
dark
fruits
and
vanilla
make
for
a
nicely
executed
barrelaged
old
ale
theres
a
reason
people
rave
about
this
stuff
its
great
there
isnt
much
of
a
body
at
all
but
it
feels
super
slick
the
caramel
and
toffee
make
it
drinkable
for
13
5
i
didnt
even
notice
it
in
the
flavor
that
much
which
is
scary
as
all
get
out
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
tasty
one
at
that
o
wow
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
was
very
dissapointed
they
didnt
have
any
for
sale
in
bottle
even
though
the
menu
indicated
they
had
some
would
gladly
pay
8
00
per
bottle
for
a
few
of
these
this
is
rapidly
going
to
be
something
i
search
for
and
has
moved
into
the
upper
tier
of
beers
that
i
have
enjoyed
trade
from
deyholla
part
of
an
awesome
box
thanks
2011
bottle
pours
cloudy
dark
brownish
red
with
a
hint
of
kahki
head
smell
is
an
amazing
blend
of
vanilla
caramel
chocolate
oak
bourbon
and
maybe
some
brandy
beautiful
surprisingly
mellow
flavor
bready
malts
and
chocolate
fade
into
strong
vanilla
oak
and
subtle
caramel
notes
bourbon
is
there
up
front
but
dissapates
into
the
complexity
of
the
barrels
quickly
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
stout
almost
like
a
caramello
dipped
in
bourbon
with
vanilla
ice
cream
on
top
and
yet
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
just
fantastic
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
slow
sipper
of
a
beer
meant
to
be
enjoyed
like
one
would
enjoy
a
sherry
port
or
cognac
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
day
you
dont
come
across
many
olde
ales
that
are
as
english
as
this
a
true
treat
o
we
tried
this
about
a
year
ago
2011
version
next
to
the
ba
papier
coton
cuir
set
and
it
was
better
than
everything
except
the
ba
coton
i
didnt
rate
it
because
i
was
in
poor
form
but
i
can
now
say
that
the
2012
has
proved
that
this
beer
is
quite
incredible
i
almost
wish
that
mike
didnt
send
it
because
now
i
need
more
o
amazing
beer
im
afraid
ill
be
disappointed
by
any
old
ales
that
i
come
across
next
o
very
impressive
ba
old
ale
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
its
certainly
lived
up
to
the
hype
this
beer
is
drinking
phenomenally
out
of
the
gate
i
have
no
idea
why
anyone
would
intentionally
age
this
beer
forever
iso
the
ultimate
benchmark
within
the
style
perfection
thanks
liamt07
o
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
recently
simply
fantastic
and
something
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
flavor
and
aroma
rival
any
other
beer
in
the
style
overall
easy
to
see
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
and
it
deserves
every
point
of
it
marvelous
stuff
perfect
sipping
cold
weather
beer
o
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
particularly
on
draft
dont
miss
it
overall
first
time
for
me
with
this
one
and
i
have
to
say
it
has
lived
up
to
its
hype
i
find
this
to
be
a
fantastic
sipping
beer
with
absolutely
everything
i
look
for
in
this
style
i
am
now
on
an
indefinite
iso
for
this
beer
i
truly
can
not
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
hits
all
the
marks
for
me
well
minus
the
appearance
but
honestly
who
the
fuck
cares
what
it
looks
like
when
it
smells
and
tastes
this
good
o
this
was
outside
the
box
the
unexpected
paid
8
for
the
tulip
fairly
reasonable
for
what
i
got
some
city
bars
charge
8
for
bud
shit
lights
this
was
worth
every
penny
and
then
some
kuhnhenn
is
an
incredible
place
to
be
and
an
incredible
brewery
i
recommend
visiting
the
brewery
if
you
can
as
well
as
trying
this
beer
overall
nice
and
tasty
big
beer
i
prefer
the
regular
because
i
like
the
way
the
malts
develop
over
time
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
o
as
i
mentioned
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
really
a
great
beer
overall
well
enjoyed
dark
brown
pour
nearly
opaque
surprisingly
considering
the
abv
capped
with
a
relatively
substantial
beige
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
wispy
layer
leaving
oily
streaks
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
so
much
of
what
i
enjoy
in
this
style
creamy
caramel
vanilla
bourbonsoaked
oak
dark
fruit
brandylike
booze
the
taste
reflected
the
aroma
thick
caramel
and
brown
sugar
vanilla
woody
bourbon
plums
raisins
great
though
unlike
some
other
big
old
ales
and
barleywines
the
flavor
seemed
to
fade
a
bit
as
it
warmed
maybe
it
was
just
my
palate
adjusting
andor
numbing
to
the
alcohol
which
was
definitely
present
but
relatively
wellhidden
smooth
full
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
appropriately
and
a
great
sipper
overall
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
o
pretty
good
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
beers
like
hotd
adam
nice
flavor
but
lacking
in
some
other
areas
and
still
pretty
hot
after
almost
two
years
looking
forward
to
this
years
batch
will
likely
revisit
this
review
with
a
fresher
bottle
this
was
just
too
good
o
this
is
a
big
beer
in
regards
to
abv
as
well
drinkability
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
through
my
3
oz
pour
this
could
use
a
couple
more
years
to
potentially
smooth
out
since
it
was
quite
hot
and
bourbon
heavy
very
rich
very
sweet
maybe
a
touch
too
much
sugar
not
a
ton
of
depth
but
a
ton
of
flavor
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
im
not
sure
its
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
old
ale
ive
had
but
still
very
good
and
definitely
one
thats
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
awesome
old
ale
they
nailed
everything
here
dont
be
fooled
by
the
looks
overall
outstanding
lots
of
characteristics
of
other
great
barrel
aged
brews
but
a
unique
one
overall
bb4d
is
a
fantastic
barrel
aged
old
ale
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
barrel
aging
has
vastly
improved
the
base
beer
i
love
the
bourbon
character
but
it
seems
to
hide
a
little
of
the
complexity
that
was
on
offer
in
the
flavour
of
the
base
beer
o
this
beer
is
beyond
fantastic
by
far
the
best
old
ale
ive
ever
had
i
need
to
start
hoarding
more
of
this
stuff
for
years
to
come
i
would
give
my
firstborn
for
a
case
of
this
o
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
quite
some
time
and
im
really
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
this
beers
reputation
is
well
deserved
one
of
the
best
ba
beers
i
have
ever
had
just
perfect
definitely
a
sipping
beer
with
heavy
malt
sweetness
and
slowly
unraveling
depth
of
flavor
digging
it
thanks
again
al
pours
a
rust
brown
with
no

bourbon
cherry
chocolate

caramel
aroma
flavor
was
dominate
bourbon
cherry
booze
chocolate
foot
tobacco
toffee
and
caramel
no
carbonation
in
the
finish
very
boozy
dry
a
bit
of
sweetness
this
was
good
and
had
a
bunch
going
on
in
it
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
the
similar
barrely
flavors
that
the
ba
barley
wine
had
and
i
really
didnt
care
for
that
one
at
all
this
worked
a
bit
better
but
it
just
misses
world
class
for
me
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
phenomenal
barrel
aged
beer
exploding
with
wonderful
flavors
and
scents
i
wish
this
was
the
norm
and
not
the
exception
medium
to
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
13
50
abv
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier
there
is
no
alcohol
heat
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
i
enjoyed
this
version
a
little
bit
more
than
the
regular
version
i
thought
it
was
slightly
under
carbonated
but
the
depth
and
complexity
of
flavors
was
very
nice
ill
definitely
have
this
again
given
the
chance

this
with

o
im
more
than
a
bit
disapointed
with
this
one
but
i
did
have
pretty
high
expectations
still
for
an
old
ale
id
like
to
see
more
leathery
oxidized
andor
tannic
flavors
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
i
guess
if
you
have
a
real
sweet
tooth
this
beer
is
for
you
otherwise
steer
clear
o
intense
is
the
word
here
delicious
as
a
dessert
way
too
much
to
drink
very
much
of
ill
work
my
way
through
this
bottle
but
its
going
to
take
a
while
fwiw
i
think
calling
this
an
old
ale
is
a
mischaracterization
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
old
ale
the
barrel
aging
definitely
takes
its
toll
on
some
of
the
finer
points
of
the
reviewing
process
but
this
beer
is
a
damn
good
example
of
the
style
a
great
sipper
after
dinner
o
a
splendid
old
ale
from
kuhnhenns
that
impresses
from
the
moment
you
first
get
a
whiff
of
it
it
has
a
strong
and
complex
nose
that
really
blows
you
away
the
flavors
blend
sweet
fruity
and
bourbony
together
perfectly
so
that
the
all
play
off
of
each
other
instead
of
one
overpowering
the
rest
of
the
beer
it
reminds
you
why
people
will
go
to
the
winter
solstice
and
stand
outside
in
a
detroit
winter
to
get
some
of
this
this
is
one
to
seek
out
and
savor
well
done
pours
a
very
dark
nearblack
almost
zero
head
but
a
few
mediumsize
bubbles
remain
fantastic
fragrance
of
dark
fruits
chocolate
molasses
licorice
and
bourbon
taste
very
much
follows
the
nose
though
these
is
an
amazing
complexity
here
in
addition
to
the
chocolate
molasses
dark
fruit
and
bourbon
notes
there
are
hints
of
oak
soy
and
a
hint
of
tobacco
its
sweeter
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
definitely
more
lush
of
a
taste
compared
to
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
big
definitely
a
slow
sipper
sort
of
beer
though
despite
its
abv
it
doesnt
show
its
hidden
quite
well
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
quite
unique
and
deserves
its
position
on
the
list
this
is
a
great
one
worth
every
accolade
it
receives
everything
great
about
old
ales
this
one
packs
thanks
kawilliams81
overall
an
incredible
tasty
and
balanced
old
ale
the
barrel
notes
are
strong
and
flavorful
and
well
balanced
really
tasty
and
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
non
stouts
ive
ever
had
i
am
definitely
going
to
try
to
get
my
hands
on
more
o
kuhnhenn
seems
to
have
been
going
for
the
old
ale
to
end
all
old
ales
and
alas
theyve
done
it
styledefining
for
barrelaged
old
ales
its
just
the
right
mix
of
barrel
booze
and
bold
malt
a
beautiful
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
one
of
my
favourite
old
ales
the
bourbon
improves
the
base
beer
which
was
already
good
big
time
delicious
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
and
a
few
bubbles
around
the
edge
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
huge
vanilla
bourbon
caramel
and
light
chocolate
as
well
as
quite
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
bourbon
vanilla
and
some
light
chocolate
the
finish
has
a
strong
alcohol
presence
full
bodied
low
carbonation
this
was
quite
good
despite
the
alcohol
being
very
prominent
o
i
really
dont
understand
the
hype
surrounding
this
one
although
it
hides
the
abv
well
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
it
c
o
thick
rich
and
tasty
o
big
massive
sipper
close
to
wine
like
in
complexity
lots
of
alcohol
is
the
only
real
negative
to
this
brilliantly
done
and
just
a
treat
to
drink
if
you
like
high
abv
and
high
gravity
beers
i
like
this
beer
about
as
much
as
i
liked
the
nonbal
version
both
are
really
nice
o
second
time
to
try
it
and
wish
i
was
better
at
reviews
but
man
all
i
can
say
is
go
but
this
one
for
sure
dont
walk
run
originally
reviewed
01312012
pretty
good
much
better
than
the
regular
version
although
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
base
beer
that
said
the
bourbon
is
very
well
integrated
and
adds
a
lot
to
this
one
so
it
was
still
enjoyable
as
with
all
kuhnhenn
overall
rating
takes
a
hit
because
it
is
almost
completely
flat
decreasing
the
drinkability
o
im
completely
floored
by
this
beer
the
nose
and
taste
are
top
top
notch
and
everything
else
was
great
as
well
its
great
to
get
a
beer
that
absolutely
lives
up
to
the
hype
permanently
iso
the
hype
is
real
but
im
wondering
if
they
left
some
bourbon
in
the
barrel
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
to
the
regular
version
i
tried
recently
and
im
blown
away
by
the
difference
thanks
again
liamt07
for
this
gem
of
a
bad
boy
o
nice
beer
very
good
very
sweet
good
barrel
character
o
very
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
13
5
barrel
aged
beer
booze
is
so
subtle
and
works
very
very
well
wish
i
had
this
on
its
own
instead
of
just
behind
the
bbbw
the
bbbw
is
so
balanced
and
outstanding
i
think
it
outshined
this
a
bit
and
diminished
my
impression
this
is
an
excellent
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
still
under
control
a
slow
sipper
that
has
great
complexity
of
flavor
and
aroma
definitely
a
great
beer
worthy
of
seeking
out
m
medium
and
times
full
as
stated
above
the
11
couldnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
2010
whatever
they
did
to
that
earlier
batch
was
magical
and
i
want
more
d
this
is
a
cool
stoutbarleywine
hybrid
expressing
some
of
the
best
notes
of
both
styles
but
not
overextending
its
reach
in
either
direction
i
want
more
i
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
warren
mi
the
color
of
the
body
was
dark
mahogany
almost
like
coca
cola
and
the
head
formed
a
tight
lasting
cafecolored
barrier
near
the
rim
of
my
snifter
smells
oaky
and
strong
scents
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
unbelievable
it
was
soooo
smooth
this
beer
hit
with
many
flavorsapple
bourbon
coffee
chocolate
and
finished
with
warm
alcohol
overtones
the
alcohol
was
present
thoroughout
but
it
seemed
to
bite
more
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
creme
body
the
body
was
consistent
and
allowed
for
timed
released
flavor
waves
to
hit
your
palate
this
beer
is
excellent
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
passing
through
warren
mi
the
brewery
is
great
too
it
is
very
lowkey
and
prices
are
very
reasonable
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
overtones
its
a
little
chalkylooking
no
head
just
some
fizz
on
top
the
smell
is
old
flower
water
molasses
something
boozy
the
taste
is
big
lots
of
maple
and
molasses
something
plummy
a
bit
of
bourbon
in
the
finish
its
a
little
hot
though
not
too
much
so
thick
and
chewy
low
in
carbonation
a
nice
beer
would
go
well
with
a
pecan
blondie
verdict
awesome
old
ale
probably
the
best
ive
had
and
one
of
the
better
barrel
aged
beers
ive
ever
tried
a
home
run
o
what
a
beer
absolutely
fantastic
not
that
much
different
from
the
regular
4d
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
te
standard
4d
is
incredible
in
its
own
right
and
the
bourbon
barrel
again
here
is
not
dramatic
but
is
a
nice
addition
to
an
already
incredible
base
beer
world
class
o
very
good
beer
although
its
hot
being
relatively
fresh
but
i
believe
this
beer
will
be
even
better
in
a
year
or
so
cheers
damn
shorty
o
i
didnt
think
the
regular
4d
could
get
any
better
oopsie
barrel
aging
that
bad
boy
just
enhanced
everything
i
loved
about
the
regular
4d
and
just
added
new
layers
of
complexity
i
couldnt
be
more
happy
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
very
sticky
dark
molasses
brown
in
color
with
no
head
at
all
the
nose
is
unreal
there
is
so
much
oak
vanilla
molasses
toffee
light
cocoa
bourbon
barrel
and
raisin
it
is
sweet
yet
ridiculously
complex
it
smells
like
an
aged
mother
of
all
storms
but
better
the
flavors
are
rich
and
malty
there
is
loads
of
residual
sugar
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
being
13
5
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
vanilla
oak
bourbon
raisins
figs
and
molasses
are
featured
in
a
true
masterpiece
the
flavor
is
everything
that
you
would
hope
it
to
be
it
drinks
medium
in
body
with
plenty
of
residual
sugar
and
a
resonating
after
taste
it
is
all
done
so
well
this
is
the
best
barrel
aged
old
ale
around
if
you
ask
me
bourbon
barrel
4th
dementia
is
world
class
very
drinkable
beer
pretty
easy
to
put
away
a
bottle
on
your
own
but
much
more
than
that
and
it
would
probably
get
a
little
cloying
this
is
a
fine
beer
though
definitely
the
best
old
ale
ive
had
o
a
really
outstanding
beer
blends
the
bourbon
flavor
perfectly
with
fruit
and
caramel
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
id
like
to
try
it
with
age
but
love
it
new
overall
damn
good
old
ale
would
drink
this
all
the
time
this
is
a
really
wonderful
sipper
im
forcing
myself
to
think
of
it
as
a
slow
sipper
because
i
could
see
moving
through
it
more
quickly
than
it
requires
after
being
a
little
underwhelmed
by
the
regular
4d
im
really
impressed
with
this
its
a
strong
assertive
ale
that
is
much
improved
by
the
barrel
aging
im
looking
forward
to
sitting
on
my
other
bottle
until
late
next
fall
or
so
pours
a
murky
and
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
randomly
around
the
glas
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
and
bourbon
taste
is
of
bourbon
wood
brown
sugar
carameltoffee
and
malt
there
is
a
slight
sourness
to
the
taste
but
nothing
that
really
detracts
from
the
flavors
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
and
very
thick
mouthfeel
that
lends
to
a
very
rich
drinking
experience
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
barrel
aged
old
ale
with
some
very
nice
aromas
and
flavors
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
i
love
bourbon
aged
beers
and
this
is
definiely
one
of
my
top
3
i
had
glad
i
have
another
bottle
on
the
way
to
age
o
delicious
beer
one
of
the
best
old
ales
ive
had
the
2010
version
that
i
am
drinking
has
excellent
balance
i
can
imagine
the
barrel
flavors
are
unbelievable
when
its
fresh
overall
reminds
me
of
a
harvest
ale
on
dope
had
it
on
a
bottle
didnt
love
it
better
on
tap
not
super
outstanding
but
fine
and
better
than
regular
4d
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
was
very
excited
to
try
this
one
out
as
this
is
a
wellregarded
brew
in
beer
snobbery
circles
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
root
beer
brown
with
thin
offwhite
head
beautiful
lacing
that
lasted
extremely
well
throughout
aromas
of
marshmallows
toffee
caramel
and
hints
of
bourbon
smooth
wellmasked
bourbon
in
the
flavors
along
with
caramel
and
some
maple
syrup
amazing
smooth
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
throughout
this
is
a
beer
i
definitely
want
to
try
again
o
i
downright
loved
the
regular
version
i
honestly
couldnt
imagine
how
much
better
it
could
get
but
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
know
how
regarded
this
beer
is
and
how
much
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
i
was
not
disappointed
at
all
super
complex
well
crafted
o
it
was
worth
getting
once
o
there
is
some
alcohol
present
in
this
beer
especially
as
it
warms
up
the
beer
is
a
great
sipping
beer
and
has
a
wonderful
complexity
to
the
smell
and
taste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
not
super
easy
to
drink
and
is
definitely
too
strong
to
be
sessionable
drinkability
honestly
not
as
good
as
the
kbbbw
was
this
one
has
way
more
heat
and
less
of
dynamicism
between
the
barrel
aging
and
the
base
beer
that
is
the
spiciness
and
strength
of
that
base
beer
countered
the
barrel
aging
and
intense
alcohol
overtones
much
better
than
this
one
does
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
bursting
with
exciting
and
dynamic
flavors
bright
and
energetic
while
still
a
little
mellow
and
refined
at
13
5
i
was
pleasantly
buzzed
after
finishing
a
bottle
so
dont
expect
to
down
a
sixpack
of
these
and
if
you
do
happen
upon
a
sixpack
of
these
inform
me
immediately
to
assist
with
proper
disposal
but
its
worth
seeking
out
if
not
worth
selling
the
farm
for
overall
flattened
by
this
one
easily
one
of
the
best
ba
beers
out
there
already
wanting
more
hope
they
brew
more
of
this
stuff
someday
overall
very
nice
the
barrel
aging
is
spot
on
and
marries
nicely
with
the
dark
fruits
from
the
beer
an
amazing
marriage
o
i
am
very
surprised
at
the
approachability
of
this
beer
considering
it
is
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
old
ale
weighing
in
at
13
5
there
is
only
a
hint
of
heat
on
this
and
it
acts
as
a
nice
balance
to
the
sweetness
ive
had
beers
with
less
alcohol
and
much
more
age
feel
hotter
im
looking
at
you
clowns
at
goose
island
a
very
nicely
crafted
ale
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
old
ale
ive
tried
so
far
the
only
thing
hampering
its
overall
score
for
me
is
the
appearance
but
fortunately
its
the
least
important
factor
when
enjoying
a
beer
in
my
opinion
so
i
bumped
it
up
a
bit
to
account
for
my
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
o
probably
the
best
old
ale
i
have
had
great
flavor
profile
and
amazingly
smooth
with
no
real
heat
at
all
overall
a
fantastic
big
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
o
could
not
have
been
more
impressed
i
saw
the
99
rating
on
here
and
had
my
doubts
but
it
delivered
the
barrel
treatment
added
to
the
beer
which
is
something
i
really
look
for
in
a
good
aged
beer
im
thinking
a
few
years
really
helped
curb
the
alcohol
and
make
this
beer
stand
out
im
not
a
fan
of
old
ales
but
i
highly
recommend
this
2011
vintage
pours
a
thick
murky

small

is
very
inviting
fireroasted

this

lovely
bourbon
with
a
nice

well
with
some
roasted

almost

with

nice

some

flavors
very
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
and
creamy
warming
drinkability
is
high
for
such
a
big
beer
definitely
a
sipper
overall
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
i
am
happy
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
such
a
great
beer
all
around
medium
to
full
body
fairly
well
carbonated
with
a
good
amount
of
soft
bubbles
for
such
a
big
beer
definitely
a
sipping
beer
as
its
packed
with
flavor
i
should
have
just
started
drinking
this
beer
at
cellar
temperature
or
just
lightly
chilled
as
the
aroma
is
so
intense
overall
this
is
the
most
extreme
complex
and
thick
old
ale
i
have
come
across
very
impressed
maybe
even
blown
away

half

for

this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
that
ill
make
a
concerted
effort
to
get
my
hands
on
again
in
the
near
future
best
old
ale
ive
ever
had
wow
im
going
to
need
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
i
wonder
how
they
age
i
like
how
the
bourbon
aging
was
nowhere
near
the
forefront
but
instead
added
to
the
complex
and
deep
flavor
profile
love
it
overall
a
fantastic
beer
no
old
ale
really
gets
better
than
this
a
truly
remarkable
beer
overall
quite
enjoyable
but
it
doesnt
quite
end
up
sublime
for
me
far
better
than
the
bottles
of
angels
share
bourbon
ive
had
but
it
falls
short
of
hair
of
the
dog
imo
will
have
to
give
my
2011
bottle
a
couple
more
years
to
settle
down

to

a

hue
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
creamcolored
head
that
quickly
disperses
into
a
tight
band
around
the
shoulders
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
fantastic
toffee
butterscotch
and
bourbon
notes
the
nose
screams
sugary
sweet

booze
taste
follows
nose
all
i
can
say
is
wow
the
elements
of
the
nose
really
coalesce
nicely
in
the
flavor
profile
there
is
definitely
a
distinct
ethanol
presence
as
well
as
a
trace
of
maple
syrup
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in

with
a
carbonation
level
that
is
just
shy
of
still
theres
just
a
residual
tingle
on
the
tongue
theres
also
surprisingly
very
little
alcohol
heat
on
this
beer
despite
the

this
is
a

id
love
to
sit
on

of

they

thanks
to
hopstoopid
for
this
one
intense
aroma
of
caramel
overall
this
truly
is
a
worldclass
beer
everything
works
together
very
well
and
this
is
a
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
o
the
smells
and
tastes
of
barrelaged
4d
become
bigger
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
measure
up
to
the
high
abv
even
so
the
alcohol
is
always
present
which
is
expected
for
style
i
wonder
if
a
little
more
time
can
tame
this
beer
i
do
not
find
the
barrel
to
be
overpowering
and
think
it
works
quite
well
with
base
beer
a
great
sipper
and
excellent
example
of
a
barrelaged
old
ale
overall
a
great
beer
thanks
ron
o
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
personally
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
horrible
but
the
taste
was
far
better
cant
say
i
would
seek
it
out
again
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
amazing
possibly
my
favorite
beer
o
im
in
love
what
can
i
say
i
need
to
track
down
more
of
this
asap
drink
thank
you
greg
this
was
a
big
want
and
to
have
some
was
amazing
great
beer
will
def
try
to
get
my
own
bottle
of
this
2010
vintage
ive
been
sitting
on
a
bottle
of
the
nonbarrelaged
version
of
this
waiting
to
do
a
sidebyside
and
then
this
is
brought
over
in
a
surprise
strike
guess
i
cant
be
too
upset
right
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
siennaruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
malts
a
big
whiff
of
a
generic
malt
bag
baby
light
bourbon
very
light
oak
vanilla
butterscotch
and
very
light
roasted
malts
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
cocoa
sweet
toffee
light
bourbon
oak
vanilla
buttercream
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
caramel
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
almost
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
good
brew
one
that
on
the
surface
at
least
seems
to
have
taken
to
the
barrel
aging
rather
well
get
some
this
is
one
off
the
list
and
its
holding
up
to
most
expectations
this
poured
an
intense
dark
void
with
no
head
at
all
except
for
a
slight
bit
of
a
bubble
ring
at
the
last
of
the
pour
there
is
zero
light
penetration
it
smells
like
chocolate
and
dark
malts
from
the
time
you
crack
the
bottle
the
chocolate
is
the
easiest
to
pick
out
the
taste
of
chocolate
and
something
mixed
in
there
its
hard
to
pick
it
out
i
bet
this
beer
gets
insane
after
a
year
or
two
let
some
of
the
mixed
flavors
separate
a
little
the
mouthfeel
let
me
down
a
little
even
though
you
can
tell
from
the
taste
that
hops
arent
a
big
figure
in
this
its
not
light
and
its
not
lively
there
is
no
attack
on
your
tongue
from
the
carbonation
overall
this
beer
to
quote
my
friend
is
fucking
awesome
i
could
drink
this
once
a
week
on
friday
and
be
totally
happy
my
friend
actually
thought
this
was
a
bba
imp
stout
when
he
had
some
at
dld
i
say
get
some
if
you
can
cause
this
rocks
hard
smell
is
heavy
bourbon
and
way
more
spicy
than
the
regular
also
bb4d
is
much
darker
flavor
is
perfect
nutmeg
great
balance
and
just
fantastic
perfect
marriage
of
beer
and
barrel
smooth
and
easy
drinker
abv
is
very
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
o
for
sharing
not
for
sipping
all
night
overall
amazing
sipping
beer
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
to
hold
onto
and
see
how
they
change
overtime
o
overall
this
is
an
exquisite
massive
beer
more
like
a
slightly
carbonated
sherry
than
a
beer
everything
you
want
in
an
after
dinner
drink
too
lots
of
complexity
evolves
over
the
course
of
the
glass
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
nice
sipper
a
very
good
old
ale
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
its
a
nice
one
to
sip
on
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
whatsoever
but
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
outstanding
dark
fruits
cherries
baked
apples
raisins
burnt
caramel
and
bourbon
meld
together
for
a
wonderful
bouquet
the
taste
tends
to
follow
the
nose
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
not
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
but
this
doesnt
really
impact
the
beer
in
any
negative
way
this
is
just
one
really
standout
old
ale
and
im
glad
ive
had
a
chance
to
try
it
on
a
few
occasions
2010
bottle
thanks
to
sean
is
this
really
an
ole
ale
im
kinda
thinkin
barley
wine
pour
is
a
viscous
almost
watery
butt
mud
brown
the
nose
is
chocked
full
of
bourbon
vanilla
oak
and
sweet
carmel
malt
the
taste
follows
suit
with
pleasant
dark
fruit
flavors
mixed
in
this
version
is
13
5
achie
machie
d
great
beer
thats
best
warm
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
overall
what
a
tasty
treat
this
one
is
very
barrel
forward
especially
after
the
swallow
and
although
i
usually
like
my
ba
beers
a
little
more
nuanced
this
one
just
seems
to
work
the
base
beer
and
relatively
full
bodied
palate
are
big
enough
to
support
the
big
barrel
presence
making
it
a
delicious
brew
as
opposed
to
a
harsh
booze
bomb
it
is
admittedly
still
a
little
hot
but
with
a
little
time
this
will
be
outstanding
in
fact
according
to
the
masses
it
already
is
outstanding
i
cant
argue
with
that
thanks
again
for
this
gem
steg
cheers
o
really
impressed
with
this
one
would
really
like
to
know
what
barrel
was
used
all
in
all
smooth
creamy
and
not
much
hint
of
abv
from
such
a
strong
brew
skal
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
little
time
does
for
this
i
can
easily
imagine
it
improving
with
a
bit
of
age
thanks
to
alex
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
on
a
great
trade
deep
dark
brown
appearance
with
just
a
hint
of
red
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
half
finger
head
that
quickly
faded
but
with
decent
lacing
powerful
complex
nose
loaded
with
oak
toffee
burnt
sugar
figs
and
vanilla
along
with
hints
of
caramel
and
maple
the
taste
is
just
as
bold
and
complex
as
the
nose
the
oak
and
bourbon
hit
you
right
off
the
bat
sweet
caramel
vanilla
and
raisins
with
hints
of
maple
syrup
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
with
just
a
subtle
touch
of
coconut
all
that
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
albeit
subdued
hop
bitterness
that
really
emerges
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
until
the
finish
where
theres
a
nice
slow
warming
burn
slightly
syrupy
slightly
chewy
but
very
smooth
mouthfeel
especially
considering
the
13
5
abv
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
im
really
wanting
to
crack
another
the
regular
fourth
dementia
was
great
but
this
is
world
class
another
great
michigan
beer
o
good
but
hot
in
terms
of
alcohol
this
beer
was
shared
with
me
at
the
clusterfork
4
tasting
event
at
the
bruery
unfortunately
i
have
not
had
the
regular
version
for
a
better
base
comparison
however
knowing
straight
bourbons
it
was
pretty
heavily
infused
into
the
beer
if
you
love
bourbon
then
thats
a
plus
if
you
want
more
balance
as
i
do
then
this
beer
might
have
gotten
too
much
residual
bourbon
from
the
wood
in
the
barrel
its
still
good
but
is
very
much
a
sipper
of
a
beer
and
even
12
oz
split
a
3
ways
was
plenty
13
50
the
whole
experience
is
extremely
smooth
velvety
and
creamy
everything
is
in
place
even
for
the
low
carbonation
i
have
hardly
a
qualm
for
this
beer
o
an
incredibly
deep
and
layered
beer
each
flavour
plays
well
with
each
other
a
touch
hot
right
now
but
still
a
stellar
brew
loved
it
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
definitely
top
10
for
me
ive
never
really
had
a
beer
like
this
overall
im
very
happy
i
went
back
and
picked
up
the
bourbon
barrel
version
of
this
the
barrel
aging
kicks
this
beer
into
a
whole
other
level
seek
this
one
out
im
glad
i
bought
2
overall
certainly
an
awesome
beer
and
one
i
am
glad
i
have
two
more
of
for
such
a
high
abv
the
beer
went
down
like
it
was
nothing
the
nose
and
flavors
were
absolutely
fantastic
and
worked
exquisitely
well
together
though
relatively
sweetrich
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
cant
wait
to
share
one
with
my
brotherinlaw
come
christmas
this
is
one
of
the
most
delicious
beers
ive
ever
had
and
frighteningly
easy
drinking
for
13
5
and
for
the
record
i
think
the
barrel
aging
process
really
hurt
this
beer
and
was
downright
unnecessary
i
gave
the
nonba
version
an
a
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
color
ale
with
a
tiny
foamy
head
with
limited
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
bourbon
is
quite
intense
with
lots
of
brown
sugar
notes
and
light
dry
fruits
taste
is
dominated
by
bourbon
notes
with
light
alcohol
ester
and
some
brown
sugar
with
dry
raisins
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
was
apparent
interesting
and
very
intense
and
complex
but
still
a
notch
below
the
regular
version
the
flavor
shows
off
every
inch
of
the
13
abv
the
regular
4d
and
even
5th
dementia
do
better
at
hiding
this
chocolatecovered
cherries
and
dark
rum
notes
swirl
and
warm
the
cheeks
and
stomach
while
a
dose
of
english
toffee
and
golden
raisin
linger
after
the
booziness
fades
body
is
chewy
and
thick
but
delicately
carbonated
the
alcohol
is
strong
and
seems
to
get
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
set
aside
a
lengthy
sipping
time
for
this
beer
or
better
yet
share
it
with
a
friend
a
full
bottle
while
delicious
is
almost
too
much
to
handle
in
one
sitting
give
it
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
if
youre
the
adventurous
type
overall
very
good
sipping
beer
i
wish
i
had
some
more
to
cellar
for
a
special
occasion
although
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
is
one
that
i
would
like
better
fresh
thanks

o
this
is
a
superbly
done
beer
and
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
sampled
definitely
in
my
top
10
brews
thanks
to
kgristoff
for
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
exceptional
beer
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brownish
red
with
little
to
no
head
what
so
ever
the
smell
is
a
divine
blend
of
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
toffee
the
taste
is
the
same
but
smooth
and
perfect
for
me
this
is
easily
a
top
5
beer
of
all
time
if
i
could
only
drink
this
more
often
the
world
would
be
a
much
better
place
honestly
there
are
only
1
or
2
beers
tops
that
i
currently
desire
and
desire
is
the
operative
word
here
more
than
this
one
wow
i
love
it
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
with
such
complex
flavors
theres
a
high
chance
of
something
going
wrong
but
this
is
an
artfully
crafted
brew
that
left
nothing
unaccounted
for
poured
cloudy
brown
color
with
an
average
frothy
light
brown
creamy
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
heavy
aroma
of
complex
sweet
bourbon
medium
to
full
body
with
smooth
texture
and
flat
carbonation
heavy
complex
sweet
bourbon
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
sweet
bourbon
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
my
expectations
were
met
with
a
complex
standout
brew
i
only
ask
because
ive
been
blowing
bourbon
barrel
boogers
all
day
o
one
of
my
favorites
beers
that
is
not
a
stout
well
done
i
am
glad
i
live
so
close
to
warren
and
can
find
this
on
the
shelf
at
beer
stores
from
time
to
time
overall
this
has
changed
my
views
on
old
ales
and
has
me
wanting
to
try
the
88
thomas
hardys
and
the
bourbon
barrel
old
stock
and
give
old
ales
another
shot
barrel
treated
or
not
o
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
works
great
as
a
dessert
beer
given
the
sweetness
its
somewhere
between
hotd
matt
and
cherry
adam
and
to
be
honest
its
better
than
both
of
them
really
glad
that
i
traded
for
some
of
this
also
very
glad
that
it
comes
in
packs
of
smaller
bottles
and
that
i
still
have
three
more
o
having
had
this
twice
now
this
has
become
one
of
my
personal
favorites
the
nose
and
taste
on
this
beer
are
stunning
and
i
would
be
a
happy
man
to
have
a
case
of
this
in
my
cellar
unfortunately
ill
have
to
live
with
the
3
bottles
i
have
left
this
is
an
amazing
brew
and
totally
worth
seeking
out
anyone
that
likes
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
would
love
this
d
no
carbonation
at
all
very
very
sweet
overall
the
only
beer
better
than
this
is
kbs
i
love
them
both
equally
overall
i
prefer
the
barrell
aged
version
of
4d
to
the
original
version
both
awesome
beers
this
is
my
second
beer
by
this
brewery
it
is
fantastic
thanks
kirk
o
a
real
meal
in
a
bottle
kuhnhenn
ba
4d
is
everything
youd
expect
it
to
be
heavy
boozy
and
incredibly
rich
and
complex
its
a
solid
beer
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
ratings
indicate
in
my
opinion
still
worth
trying
though
overall
this
is
a
sipper
in
the
best
sense
of
the
term
there
is
so
much
flavor
in
each
sip
it
is
best
enjoyed
a
small
amount
at
a
time
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
barrel
aging
really
improving
a
beer
as
i
thought
the
regular
4th
d
was
good
but
nowhere
near
this
enjoyable
overall
it
was
an
excellent
beer
and
id
definitely
put
it
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
bourbon
barrel
beers
ive
had
i
found
myself
comparing
it
a
lot
to
bcs
on
the
bourbon
barrel
flavor
aspect
which
is
a
huge
compliment
given
how
much
i
love
that
beer
if
a
little
hotness
fades
with
some
aging
i
could
easily
see
this
beer
pushing
the
score
into
my
very
top
tier
everything
came
together
in
it
perfectly
and
even
though
the
barrel
character
was
very
pronounced
the
beer
still
was
able
to
shine
a
few
minor
nitpicky
criticisms
on
the
look
and
mouthfeel
but
overall
a
fantastic
beer
its
good
o
this
is
such
a
rich
beer
if
im
looking
for
a
fault
its
that
there
is
some
rustic
character
to
add
a
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
thats
a
reach
though
this
is
phenomenal
4
55
md
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
perfect
i
thought
it
would
be
hard
to
finish
a
bottle
but
the
second
it
warmed
up
i
couldnt
stop
sipping
it
a
great
barrel
aged
old
ale
probably
the
best
out
there
consider
the
price
and
availably
of
it
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tried
and
second
only
to
alpine
great
in
the
high
alcohol
barrel
aged
type
of
styles
i
especially
enjoy
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
warming
mayple
syrup
and
burnt
toffee
feel
in
the
finish
d
a
total
sipper
the
alcohol
is
masked
much
better
than
the
regualr
4d
this
beer
was
made
to
be
aged
in
oak
its
a
great
combination
mo
there
beer
really
comes
into
its
self
when
it
warms
up
to
near
room
temperature
when
i
first
opened
this
beer
it
was
far
too
cold
and
it
did
the
beer
no
justice
let
it
warm
and
this
beer
comes
into
its
self
o
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
that
will
only
get
better
with
age
which
might
help
take
some
of
the
heat
off
of
it
it
belongs
up
there
with
the
upper
echelon
of
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
even
though
it
calls
itself
an
old
ale
now
kuhnhenns
brewering
co
is
on
my
map
may
even
be
worth
the
drive
editi
was
wrong
i
had
a
2010
bottle
that
i
aged
and
the
beer
really
went
downhill
seems
as
though
its
best
to
drink
this
fresh
o
an
excellent
barrel
aged
barleywineold
ale
probably
my
favorite
to
date
i
will
be
looking
to
trade
for
this
very
impressed
in
fact
i
really
dig
it
worthy
of
every
praise
this
is
like
sipping
fine
elko
mn
maple
syrup
virtually
no
carbonation
still
flat
but
man
is
it
good
this
is
one
of
those
kuhnhenn
beers
that
makes
it
worth
getting
through
their
catalog
excellent
beer
only
a
breeze
below
the
noseintheair
echelon
of
elite
barrelaged
beers
maybe
somebody
ought
to
send
me
another
so
i
can
make
sure
i
didnt
miss
anything
sticky
and
thick
oily
just
perfect
a
little
hot
but
that
is
excusable
at
such
a
high
abv
beers
like
this
grow
my
like
for
this
style
more
and
more
a
really
great
sipper
nothing
could
be
better
about
this
beer
overall
yum
sandwich
this
goes
down
as
the
best
old
ale
i
ve
ever
had
and
easily
one
of
the
top
10
beers
ive
ever
tasted
the
smoothness
is
jaw
dropping
and
the
taste
is
outstanding
the
more
i
had
of
the
bottle
the
more
i
enjoyed
and
truly
savored
this
treat
o
a
very
good
beer
not
extremely
complex
but
avoids
being
too
sweet
damn
this
was
awesome
the
brewers
father
had
opened
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
friend
and
myself
to
try
at
the
brewery
when
we
were
there
thanks
to
him
for
a
much
appreciated
sample
of
this
gem
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
little
tan
head
on
it
the
smell
was
fantastic
on
this
beer
rich
and
roasted
aromas
with
sweet
vanilla
bourbon
spewing
from
it
the
taste
is
wonderfully
blended
with
the
complexity
of
the
old

awesome

finished
pleasantly
boozy
and

on
the
aftertaste
every
flavor
in
this
beer
melded
extremely
well
with
one
another
just
outstanding
this
rating
is
from
the
tap
at
jackie
os
was
really
happy
to
see
this
was
made
again
and
even
happier
to
have
a
chance
to
have
it
on
tap
never
thought
this
would
live
up
to
the
first
batch
from
a
few
years
ago
i
am
glad
i
was
wrong
the
appearance
on
draft
wasnt
much
to
write
home
about
brownish
in
color
with
almost
no
head
on
my
pour
the
aroma
is
where
this
beer
starts
to
pick
up
some
steam
caramel
oak
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
bourbony
booze
flavor
continues
to
much
the
same
with
a
huge
hit
of
vanilla
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
i
did
not
find
it
overwhelming
given
the
opportunity
this
will
age
beautifully
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
on
the
syrupy
side
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
and
low
carbonation
thats
just
fine
but
there
is
a
slight
flaw
in
that
the
finish
is
just
a
touch
too
dry
id
like
some
lingering
sweetness
and
instead
this
seems
a
bit
drying
overall
with
a
few
small
missteps
noted
this
is
a
legendary
brew
and
one
i
would
be
happy
to
enjoy
again
and
again
ill
be
sure
to
make
the
trip
up
to
kuhnhenn

the
next
release

lots

some

deep

the

the

on

but
it
does
not
detract
from
how
great
this
thing
is
d
i
am
extremely
happy
to
have
finally
tried
this
beer
as
it
is
one
of
the
top
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
have
ever
tried
i
am
very
curious
to
see
how
this
one
will
age
as
well
5
0
d
this
is
one
helluva
beer
theres
no
getting
around
that
this
takes
a
very
good
beer
and
supplements
it
with
bourbon
barrel
flavors
which
makes
it
a
truly
world
class
brew
the
base
beer
is
still
strong
enough
to
shine
while
the
barrel
aging
adds
everything
you
would
want
and
nothing
you
wouldnt
overall
omg
amazing
doesnt
sum
this
beer
up
enough
you
do
get
a
strong
kick
of
the
bourbon
but
when
it
balances
out
with
the
sugary
sweet
tastes
it
all
makes
sense
and
the
booze
is
not
overpowering
in
any
way
especially
for
the
very
high
abv
kuhnhenn
definitely
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
it
is
an
absolute
gem
of
a
beer
and
i
feel
privileged
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
one
just
be
warned
to
dont
have
one
of
these
and
attempt
to
do
anything
but
relax
for
the
next
couple
hours
it
will
knock
you
on
your
face
bourbon
barrel
4th

pours
an
intense
mahogany
with
a
nice
cherry
shimmer
along
the
edge
of
the
glass
when
its
held
up
to
light
theres
a
small
amount
of
khaki
colored
foam
capping
it
as
well
caramel
is
the
clear
standout
in
the
smell
department
it
actually
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
the
ice
cream
place
i
work
for
making
their
hot
caramel
topping
theres
also
an
undercurrent
of
vanilla
running
throughout
the
nose
and
a
definite
bourbon
note
is
present
as
well
the
aroma
was
good
but
from
the
first
sip
this
beer
blasted
off
into
the
topmost
echelon
of
any
beer
ive
ever
had
caramel
is
still
there
in
spades
and
is
again
joined
by
vanilla
and
an
impressively
smooth
bourbon
quality
newcomers
to
the
party
include
flavors
of
creamy
milk
chocolate
and
and
toasted
marshmallows
theres
also
a
delightfully
mild
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
its
absurd
to
think
that
this
ones
13
5
alcohol
because
it
drinks
like
its
only
about
9
the
body
is
impossibly
rich
and
creamy
and
is
balanced
by
the
absolute
perfect
carbonation
its
just
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
prevent
the
beer
from
coming
across
as
cloying
bourbon
barrel
4th
dementia
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
draft
pour
of
abacus
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
which
i
guess
makes
sense
seeing
as
ive
never
seen
there
to
be
a
huge
line
between
english
barleywines
and
old
ales
in
the
first
place
and
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
d
flavorful
but
a
bit
out
of
balance
right
now
aging
should
do
this
wonders
o
applause
this
has
really
come
through
strong
while
i
loved
the
non
ba
4d
this
just
is
a
different
beer
and
it
is
done
extremely
well
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
hell
of
a
lot
and
a
little
mix
of
this
into
some
k
raspberry
eisbock
goes
a
long
way
o
well
the
hype
is
warranted
this
is
a
spectacular
brew
that
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
its
subtly
is
its
winning
quality
but
its
bold
ass
hell
at
the
same
time
its
hard
to
explain
just
go
out
and
drink
one
and
youll
see
bottle

flavor
is

pleasant

spicy
on
the
finish
dark

some
cookielike
qualities
to
this
as
well
the
sweet
fruits
play
with
the
old
leather
tobacco
and
spices
really
well
this
is
very
good
way
better
than
abacus
on
par
with
the
old
stock
reserves
if
not
better
a
bit
under
wooden
hell
got
this
one
to
celebrate
easter
with
my
family
didnt
get
the
chance
to
drink
it
there
but
im
glad
because
now
ill
be
able
to
give
it
my
full
attention
after
a
vigorous
pour
it
is
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
streaming
bubbles
i
smell
bourbon
molasses
raisin
and
a
little
vanilla
not
an
overpowering
taste
of
bourbon
but
i
also
get
some
molasses
and
raisin
the
13
5
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
let
down
for
me
it
has
a
full
body
with
very
little
carbonation
i
picture
this
not
unlike
a
drink
that
they
would
have
in
the
medieval
times
i
guess
that
makes
sense
since
its
an
old
ale
this
will
take
me
a
while
to
drink
and
ill
savor
every
sip
overall
very
complex
brew
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
me
lower
the
score
a
little
o
kuhnenhn
should
be
applauded
for
this
this
is
a
warning
shot
over
hair
of
the
dogs
bow
someone
else
in
america
knows
how
to
make
an
outstanding
old
ale
o
an
all
around
exceptional
brew
i
thought
the
normal
version
was
good
but
this
takes
it
to
the
next
level
thanks
again
for
hooking
it
up
jeff
o
fantastic
beer
shocked
at
how
smooth
and
tasty
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beverages
ive
drank
in
a
while
a
fantastic
ba
beer
i
think
it
almost
rivals
a
beer
like
ba
behemoth
incredible
smell
and
taste
unfortunately
difficult
to
obtain
in
my
area
even
for
those
in
mi
special
thanks
to
wadsey
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
this
i
had
a
small
sample
of
this
at
the
michigan
winter
beerfest
but
my
palate
was
already
wrecked
at
that
time
d
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
incredibly
impressive
beer
in
all
respects
and
an
improvement
in
nearly
every
way
over
the
normal
version
the
only
complaint
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
it
does
become
a
little
heavy
on
the
alcohol
astringency
as
it
warms
but
for
13
50
im
just
surprised
it
wasnt
there
all
along
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
sipper
but
it
is
enjoyable
the
whole
time
o
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
so
i
tend
to
have
a
hard
time
judging
it
this
one
seemed
to
fit
the
style
to
a
t
really
nice
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
thanks
alex
most
generous
that
guy
d
a
fantastic
old
ale
rich
and
sweet
yet
complex
and
smooth
despite
the
abv
very
well
done
i
find
it
very
rewarding
to
see
a
beer
that
actually
benefits
from
barrel
aging
and
in
this
is
a
shining
example
how
it
should
be
while
i
might
just
barely
favor
the
regular
non
barrel
aged
version
this
is
still
a
top
notch
beer
in
its
own
right
on

at
the

brown

plum
tobacco

some

heavy
mouthfeel
flavors
follow
the
nose
exactly
the
bourbon
is
really
upfront
but
the
flavors
stand
up
well
to
the
booze
a
touch
hot
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
angels
share
to
an
extent
a
great
beer
o
a
champion
of
the
style
a
phenomenal
barleywine
that
truly
benefits
from
its
time
in
the
barrel
overall
a
very
nice
beer
not
much
to
critique
here
a
little
more
body
and
slightly
less
booze
would
be
nice
but
really
not
in
need
of
any
serious
alterations
imo
a
great
beer
thanks
again
alex
my
first
ever
kuhnhenn
beer
was
a
true
experience
to
remember
a
sipper
for
sure
highly
highly
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
old
ale
the
kuhnhenn
bros
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
brew
d
great
sipper
drinkability
this
one
is
quite
easy
to
sip
on
considering
it
was
ordered
as
my
first
on
three
separate
occasions
proves
to
me
that
this
is
a
solid
brew
enjoy
this
one
with
the
free
house
popcorn
and
good
conversation
overall
a
great

the

very

stuff
i
am
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
d
a
massive
beer
that
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
very
well
made
and
enjoyable
cheers
overall
really
delicious
d
i
loved
this
one
i
love
the
normal
version
as
well
and
think
the
bourbon
barrels
made
this
even
better
would
love
to
try
this
again
d
its
kind
of
boozy
but
damn
is
this
stuff
is
tasty
i
could
drink
a
bottle
of
this
almost
any
day
d
really
a
great
treat
it
is
a
nice
sipper
for
a
nice
winter
night
since
we
got
about
6
inches
of
snow
today
the
bourbon
is
very
nice
in
this
one
and
it
is
top
notch
i
really
wish
i
had
more
but
ill
let
my
last
bottle
cellar
for
a
couple
years
before
i
try
it
again
miraculously
this
seems
to
have
fallen
off
especially
the
mouthfeel
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
it
once
had
it
seems
to
have
lost
it
in
the
past
few
months
its
just
become
mellow
tons
of
honey
still
excellent

some

a

of
a
thin

nose
is
really
nice
and

with

dark

brown

and
plenty
of

everything
is
integrated
well
and
theres
just
a
bit
of
booze
in
the
background
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
complex
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
booze
in
the
flavor
than
was
present
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
the
bourbon
and
booze
integrate
well
with
the
body
on
this
very
delicious
and
im
looking
forward
to
some
aged
bottles
of
this
in
the
future
this
beer
is
comparable
to
a
fine
vintage
or
tawny
port
and
would
work
equally
well
at
the
conclusion
of
a
fine
meal
just
an
altogether
excellent
fine
aged
ale
from
the
folks
at
kuhnhenn
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
completely
coats
the
mouth
its
sweet
up
front
and
gives
way
to
a
nice
smooth
liquor
flavor
on
the
midpalate
leading
to
a
mild
but
clean
bitterness
at
the
back
its
subtle
but
there
the
whole
beer
is
good
i
want
to
hold
it
in
my
mouth
there
is
a
nearly
treaclelike
sweetness
through
out
minimal
esters
and
other
characters
a
very
good
beer
d
ive
had
this
twice
in
a
month
sadly
i
think
thats
probably
going
to
be
the
last
time
i
have
it
no
ill
totally
be
driving
the
4
hours
to
warren
to
snag
this
again
simply
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
muddy
reddishbrown
with
little
head
low
carbonation
good
enough
for
what
it
is
the
aroma
on
the
other
hand
is
incredible
burnt
sugar
integrated
oak
and
bourbon
stewed
dark
fruits
some
leathery
portlike
oxidation
too
very
little
noticeable
alcohol
the
taste
likewise
is
incredible
brown
sugarmolasses
flavors
provide
a
backbone
for
notes
of
leather
and
bourbon
theres
a
nice
fruitiness
thats
datelike
and
graceful
oxidation
that
lends
a
touch
of
port
and
cocoa
the
body
is
full
carbonation
low
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
this
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
kuhnhenns
2005
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
smooth
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
drinkable
with
more
of
an
herbal
earthy
bitterness
and
dryness
that
i
was
not
expecting
very
well
done
and
a
complete
transformation
from
the
nonbarreled
version
that
i
had
not
too
long
ago
this
could
be
a
real
gem
in
a
few
years
wish
i
had
a
bottle
or
two
to
stash
away
do
yourself
a
huge
favor
pick
up
at
least
two
of
these
and
drink
one
now
then
age
the
other
as
long
as
possible
i
think
that
will
reveal
this
beers
true
potential
which
i
forecast
will
be
amazing
could
definitely
use
some
more
ageing
the
abv
gets
in
the
way
of
things
and
knocks
of
some
complexity
points
otherwise
this
beer
is
fantastic
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
decadent
complex
and
wonderfully
balanced
for
such
a
massive
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
possibly
ever
overall
this
beer
is
phenomenal
no
doubts
about
it
im
not
sure
it
is
really
an
improvement
on
the
regular

dementia
but
rather
an
equally
good
but
different
beer
drinkability
barrel
aging
claims
another
victory
it
just
made
a
great
beer
even
better
obviously
a
sipper
but
i
would
be
satisfied
sipping
this
for
a
long
time
d
it
took
me
an
hour
to
finish
my
pour
but
i
really
took
my
time
to
enjoy
it
since
it
was
my
only
beer
of
the
visit
it
was
excellent
ontap
and
im
looking
forward
to
cracking
a
bottle
in
the
near
future
a
musttry
d
splitting
a
12oz
bottle
three
ways
was
an
appropriate
serving
although
i
could
probably
tackle
a
bottle
on
my
own
if
i
was
feeling
ambitious
this
should
cellar
extremely
well
and
should
only
improve
with
age
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
for
the
high
alcohol
cotent
very
good
i
really
like
this
one
search
this
out
so
flavorful
yet
easy
to
drink
at
13
d
for
a
high
abv
beer
this
has
excellent
drinkability
it
went
down
easy
and
i
could
have
easily
had
more
of
this
i
dont
really
know
what
to
compare
this
beer
to
as
ive
never
really
had
anything
like
it
more
brewerys
should
experiment
with
a
bourbon
aged
old
ale
just
as
great
on
tap
a
year
later
at
winter
solstice
thick
incredible
bourbon
aroma
rich
taste
magnificent
somewhat
on
the
sweet
side
though
overall
this
was
fantastic
my
first
two
ba
beers
from
them
have
both
been
two
of
the
best
i
haev
ever
had
they
really
know
what
they
are
doing
with
this
one
to
be
honest
i
have
to
score
this
high
as
i
really
have
had
maybe
one
or
two
beers
that
i
truly
liked
better
then
this
in
the
style
at
all
damn
near
perfection
and
something
i
would
only
wish
i
could
get
again
hopefully
i
can
trade
for
another
bottle
d
honestly
i
liked
kuhnhenns
bourbon
barleywine
a
lot
better
this
reminded
me
a
lot
more
of
extaneous
ale
and
was
a
little
over
the
top
for
me
12er
big
time
nose
of
raspberry
covered
chocolate
caramel
toffee
vanilla
bourbon
and
charred
wood
dark
color
extremely
complex
malt
and
yeast
character
with
an
array
of
caramel
chocolate
and
fruitlike
flavors
then
on
top
of
all
that
it
has
an
intriguing
barrel
character
as
well
that
just
takes
it
to
another
level
damn
good
beer
very
dark
brown
mahogany
edges
with
a
fine
beige
cap
and
lots
of
spotty
streaky
lacing
tons
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
rich
earthyoaky
aroma
some
vanilla
and
raisin
mild
booze
balanced
bitterness
keeps
the
big
malty
sweetness
in
check
caramel
and
toffee
mild
woody
character
tootsie
roll
some
chocolate
character
amazing
rich
flavour
full
bodied
low
carbonation
makes
it
a
little
heavy
smooth
texture
kuhnhenn
has
a
knack
for
making
big
beers
extremely
drinkable
the
barrel
aging
didnt
overpower
the
base
beer
which
i
found
really
appealing
while
adding
a
new
complexity
to
a
great
old
ale
again
kuhnhenn
does
not
disappoint
this
is
one
hell
of
a
tasty
old
ale
definitely
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
excellent
the
7
or
so
months
since
i
purchased
this
bottle
has
given
it
time
to
mellow
out
and
removed
all
the
hot
alcohol
i
noticed
when
fresh
perfect
balanced
with
a
more
mellowed
warmth
than
the
regular
4th
dementia
i
thought
the
drinkability
on
that
one
was
excellent
but
this
brings
it
to
a
new
level
fantastic
stuff
pours
cola
in
color
with
an
amber
hue
nice
and
murky
a
faint
skirmish
of
caramel
colored
bubbles
skim
the
surface
and
then
quickly
fade
i
can
smell
this
beer
instantly
the
woodiness
and
rich
malts
waft
up
and
have
me
salivating
aroma
is
hugely
rich
and
sweet
with
prunes
caramel
grapes
and
vanilla
as
well
as
a
large
deep
leather
and
wood
aroma
to
balance
the
sweet
along
with
a
faint
soy
sauce
taste
follows
suit
with
some
hugely
rich
and
sweet
pruney
and
caramel
maltiness
and
a
nice
dose
of
woodiness
that
mingles
with
a
warming
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
a
slight
tingle
from
the
woodiness
blends
with
the
warm
alcohol
in
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
beer
has
pretty
much
floored
me
i
love
the
regular
4th
and
this
is
far
and
above
extremely
complex
aroma
extremely
rich
taste
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
heavenly
one
at
that
cheers
to
kuhnhenn
for
making
such
an
incredible
beer
although
this
beer
is
huge
i
could
drink
this
all
day
everyday
and
life
would
be
nice
unfortunately
i
cant
so
i
will
savor
this
beauty
for
the
next
couple
hours
as
for
drinkability
this
beer
was
definitely
a
sipper
even
with
the
strong
flavors
and
aromas
i
felt
that
the
alcohol
intensity
was
overwhelming
though
not
surprising
at
13

abv
tastes
like
a
sort
of
chocolate

a

as

this
one
seemed
to
be
the
hot

according
to
the
gathered
throng
of
ba
beer
aficionados
so
i
gave
it
a
try
poured
into

treat
on

d
not

but
this
is
my
first
barleywine
so
i
am
not
used
to
them
yet
i
could
easily
drink
this
every
day
and
not
get
tired
of
it
this
is
now
my
favorite
barleywine
by
far
exceptional
in
every
way
im
searching
for
real
estate
near
the
brewery
pours
fairly
brown
but
dark
red
when
held
to
light
with
a
strong
white
head
that
retains
very
well
and
leaves
retention
surprising
given
the
percent
smell
jumps
out
at
you
moreso
than
some
dipas
even
the
smell
is
of
bourbon
brown
sugar
cherry
molasses
vanilla
oak
and
maybe
even
some
dates
remarkable
taste
is
hard
for
me
to
keep
track
of
it
just
has
so
many
flavors
blended
together
so
well
seems
like
some
of
the
bourbon
beers
i
have
had
have
too
much
bourbon
this
is
not
the
case
with
this
one
full
bodied
with
slightly
higher
than
medium
carbonation
a
little
less
and
this
ones
perfect
a
damn
near
perfect
sipper
id
drink
plenty
of
this
if
it
was
available
well
worth
the
very
long
trip
to
michigan
for
it
highly
recommended
roughly
poured
the
head
is
wuite
large
and
the
lacing
is
seemingly
sticky
as
all
hell
the
smell
is
just
overwhelming
with
different
flavors
of
a
slight
bourbon
fig
and
its
just
really
complex
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
one
thing
before
thinking
of
something
else
the
taste
is
huge
its
got
a
high
alcohol
kick
with
some
great
full
flavors
that
wont
let
you
down
theres
a
very
sweet
coffee
roastiness
and
a
huge
fig
flavor
but
not
totally
fig
youll
notice
some
other
flavors
along
with
it
the
mouthfeel
was
great
a
little
smooth
but
theres
an
alcohol
bite
to
it
overall
this
is
really
great
i
cant
wait
to
age
it
for
a
few
years
and
see
how
the
flavors
mellow
enjoyed
this
wonderful
treat
at

this

hum
nyc
once
i
had
my
face
in
the
glass
it
was
a
nose
full
of
stoutlike
aromas
chocolate
caramel
but
the
most
memorable
feature
is
the
mouthfeel
smooth
rich
but
disporportionate
to
the
flavors
which
are
quite
subdued
overall
a
nice
bevvie
that
could
become
a
fav
the
taste
focuses
on
the
malts
more
than
anything
else
fairly
sweet
mild
bitterness
not
bad
in
the
whole
scheme
of
things
lotsomalt
a
touch
of
whisky
something
warms
the
stomach
hops
are
nonexistent
but
thats
ok
good
fall
brew
this
is
a
nice
fall
seasonal
just
what
youd
expect
its
good
for
those
cool
nights
watching
football
a
little
sweeter
than
most
fall
beers
and
not
quite
an
oktoberfest
but
close
good
beer
not
great
well
this
is
pretty
lackluster
its
a
good
beer
but
rather
boring
the
label
is
the
best
thing
about
it
also
the
color
is
a
really
deep
brown
which
was
intriguing
however
the
taste
was
rather
lacking
almost
watery
sweet
malt
was
dominant
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
darker
than
i
thought
but
enjoyable
to
drink
near
the
start
of
fall
needed
a
balance
for
our
other
tap
and
this
works
a
darker
ale
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
while
i
didnt
think
this
was
really
that
true
to
style
for
an
old
ale
it
seemed
more
in
line
with
a
brown
ale
or
altbier
but
either
way
it
lived
up
to
being
a
fitting
a
beer
for
the
season
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
creamy
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
and
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
bring
to
a
bonfire
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
nutty
aspect
it
really
worked
well
with
the
malty
flavors
and
it
showed
up
at
just
the
right
amount
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
malty
and
nutty
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
being
classified
as
an
old
ale
on
here
is
a
little
confusing
but
once
i
looked
past
that
i
was
left
with
a
nice
fall
time
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
its
one
of
the
better
fall
seasonal
s
that
ive
had
this
year
good
job
guys
i
enjoyed
this
beer
keep
up
the
solid
work
deep
golden
color
with
great
head
a
ok
lacing
smells
malty
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
carbonation
and
mouthfell
is
decent
and
this
beer
overall
is
rather
light
a
good
drinker
for
the
summer
especially
soft
subtle
nose
of
roasted
malt
bordering
on
hints
of
light
coffee
molasses
and
dark
caramels
in
the
taste
followed
by
hops
reminiscent
of
dried
leaves
hints
of
milk
chocolate
nibs
in
the
finish
nothing
complex
or
distinctive
its
a
pleasant
brew
for
the
falling
temps
of
the
season
o
ok
a
little
one
note
but
whats
there
is
good
i
was
impressed
with
the
deep
rich
hue
of
brown
and
burgundy
it
looks
like
an
old
ale
the
nose
holds
some
dry
chocolate
barley
malt
raisin
and
toasted
nut
the
flavor
is
barley
toasted
nut
dry
chocolate
some
dried
fruit
but
without
sweetness
this
is
very
dry
but
easily
approachable
breckenridge
products
seem
to
have
great
attributes
but
are
never
particularly
assertive
and
this
is
no
exception

it

still
a

for

could
use

pleasantly
enjoyable
o
an
odd
beer
definitely
not
an
old
ale
as
it
is
labeled
on
this
site
id
say
its
more
of
a
germaninfluenced
brown
caught
somewhere
between
ale
and
lager
a
little
different
maybe
but
not
very
thought
provoking
or
memorable
its
alright
and
very
drinkable
but
still
not
going
on
my
favorites
list
o
i
bought
this
beer
at
random
and
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
its
a
dark
thick
malty
beer
if
you
like
that
style
you
will
probably
like
this
one
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dark
malty
beers
but
ill
drink
them
occasionally
i
doubt
if
ill
go
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
the
body
is
medium
with
a
firm
crispness
that
runs
all
the
way
through
and
a
really
steady
smoothness
playing
off
it
it
its
pretty
steadily
semidry
more
so
in
the
finish
interesting
style
might
go
well
with
a
dark
wrap
cigar
autumn
ale
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
small
white
lacing
head
there
is
a
rich
malty
and
caramel
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
rich
malty
backbone
nice
mellow
caramel
flavors
with
some
oakey
flavors
good
full
flavors
but
very
weak
carbonation
and
flat
feeling
overall
its
a
good
nicely
flavored
old
ale
overall
there
is
a
very
solid
very
surprising
beer
like
i
stated
above
its
more
like
a
winter
porter
than
an
autumn
harvestfest
beer
good
flavors
of
roasted
malt
smokiness
and
caramel
sweetness
solid
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
no
foam
none
malty
nose
with
caramel
sweet
overwrapping
taste
some
pine
low
carebonation
almost
syruplike
bready
not
sure
what
makes
this
for
autumn
soso
o
definitely
will
drink
again
overall
not
really
the
best
harvest
ales
i
have
even
had
the
flavors
never
really
complement
each
other
well
and
the
weaker
body
only
further
diminishes
the
impacts
of
the
taste
nothing
too
special
here
o
so
lets
call
this
a
fall
time
lawnmower
beer
ill
imagine
that
ive
just
raked
a
ton
of
leaves
im
a
bit
tired
a
bit
sweaty
good
i
like
this
fine
a
very
good
is
somewhat
mundane
old
ale
malt
flavors
and
feel
are
the
highlights
and
should
appeal
to
lovers
of
maltcentric
flavored
beers
flavor
of
dark
malt
but
smooth
rather
than
roasted
and
bitter
hints
of
cocoa
and
caramel
some
smoke
and
leather
hints
of
marshmallow
and
a
subtle
vanillaoakey
finish
rich
and
multifaceted
flavors
smooth
and
round
mouthfeel
not
overly
full
very
enjoyable
beer
the
taste
is
also
malty
but
also
with
some
hops
taste
it
is
a
nicely
balanced
taste
the
finish
is
sweet
and
pleasant
overall
this
is
an
interesting
unique
variant
of
the
style
i
like
it
and
would
buy
it
again
if
i
were
looking
for
a
dark
change
of
pace
really
good
beer
id
love
to
have
this
fresh
off
the
tap
overall
i
really
like
having
this
as
opposed
to
other
beers
refered
to
as
fall
seasonals
and
autumn
ales
if
i
was
to
compare
it
to
the
better
old
ales
it
wouldnt
score
so
high
but
nothing
about
it
is
bad
its
just
a
very
drinkable
old
ale
a
bolder
satisfying
fall
beer
if
you
will
ill
pick
this
up
every
year
overall
a
full
bodied
well
balanced
autumn
brew
that
in
my
opinion
hit
all
the
high
points
of
this
style
not
the
most
complex
brew
but
nonetheless
enjoyable
overall
the
beer
is
good
but
nothing
that
made
me
jump
up
and
down
with
joy
its
the
perfect
kind
of
fall
beer
because
its
not
too
spicy
or
malty
any
average
beer
drinker
would
find
this
somewhat
enjoyable
o
a
solid
fall
seasonal
from
breckenridge
very
drinkable
even
at
6
7
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
very
thin
head
not
much
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
body
is
thin
and
mildly
carbonated
taste
is
of
sugary
spice
and
malts
a
bit
watered
down
weak
version
of
this
style
not
impressed
i
actually
applaud
the
american
brewers
who
put
out
autumn
beers
instead
of
oktoberfests
this
one
pours
a
clear
rubysienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
honey
dry
biscuit
and
cinnamon
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
light
caramel
and
some
very
light
toasted
rye
bread
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
all
that
complex
really
but
the
simplicity
is
wellexecuted
autumn
ale
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
beautiful
clarity
the
aroma
is
chocolatey
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
spicing
on
the
tongue
a
full
and
wonderful
roasty
flavor
quickly
envelops
the
mouth
theres
some
bitter
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
fall
spicing
in
here
too
fullflavored
while
not
being
overwhelming
it
smoothly
fades
out
a
little
while
after
the
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
fairly
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
does
a
great
job
of
balancing
drinkability
and
flavor
i
wish
we
had
seasons
here
in
florida
because
id
love
to
kick
back
with
this
on
a
cool
autumn
night
on
my
deck
back
in
new
jersey
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
very
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
very
light
malt
aroma
has
a
very
light
chocolate
taste
with
some
brown
sugar
tossed
in
the
mix
has
just
enough
carbonation
without
being
a
detraction
in
the
mouthfeel
department
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
could
go
down
to
quickly
and
that
is
its
biggest
problem
it
disappears
before
you
realize
it
nothing
that
makes
it
standout
from
most
other
ales
but
a
solid
go
to
choice
anyway
overall
this
a
great
fall
seasonal
beer
for
me
just
as
the
weather
is
getting
a
bit
chilly
its
like
a
mild
old
ale
or
a
scottish
ale
flavor
profile
and
the
less
than
7
abv
makes
it
okay
to
have
more
than
one
without
hitting
the
floor
like
many
other
scottishold
ales
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
malty
beer
that
is
also
pleasantly
light
and
semifreshing
notes
solid
and
nicely
drinkable
cheers
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
would
be
nice
with
pulled
pork
or
baby
back
ribs
could
also
be
a
nice
offset
to
spicy
dishes
that
are
meat
heavy
think
spicy
meat
pizza
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
o
love
me
a
good
brown
ale
and
as
such
i
can
get
picky
on
the
style
and
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
autumn
seasoning
on
the
tail
end
was
a
nice
touch
but
overall
this
one
is
a
bit
average
for
me
o
this
beer
is
nice
and
malty
but
still
quite
easy
to
drink
with
its
lighter
bodied
however
it
tastes
like
it
is
a
little
one
dimensional
and
could
use
a
little
hops
o
an
excellent
brown
ale
in
its
own
right
o
a
very
drinkable
brown
with
a
firm
bitterness
and
pleasing
roast
malt
character
o
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
classify
it
as
an
american
brown
english
brown
english
mild
or
old
ale
all
sound
better
to
me
regardless
enjoyable
and
fits
the
season
nicely
easy
to
drink
and
free
of
all
the
spices
and
pumpkins
that
you
see
in
a
lot
of
the
fall
seasonals
lately
overall
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
was
basically
flat
the
taste
was
fine
but
not
something
i
expected
from
a
fall
seasonal
not
something
id
buy
again
o
a
solid
choice
for
a
fall
brew
goes
great
with
the
opening
weekend
of
college
football
this
beer
goes
with
a
roast
beef
sandwich
while
it
is
enjoyable
as
a
daytoday
beer
there
is
nothing
special
i
certainly
do
not
recognize
this
as
an
old
ale
taste
malty
sweet
toasted
biscuit
herbal
semidry
brown
bread
dried
fruit
moreys
bottom
line
even
though
theres
plenty
around
i
dont
drink
many
breckenridge
beers
too
pricy
for
the
quality
inside
imo
that
being
said
this
is
a
pretty
decent
fall
beer
i
could
imagine
sipping
on
this
after
rakin
just
like
the
bottle
says
its
good
for
cheers
d
a
nice
beer
to
try
for
a
autumn
seasonal
especially
if
you
are
tired
of
pumpkin
or
spices
in
other
autumn
seasonals
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
refreshing
and
interesting
enough
on
the
palate
to
have
a
few
and
not
be
bored
the
taste
is
lightly
caramel
in
the
front
with
a
toasted
malt
and
nice
fruity
yeast
flavor
with
somewhat
bready
flavor
and
mild
spice
w
a
gentle
earthy
sweet
dried
fruit
taste
like
cherry
with
a
mild
hint
of
hops
which
are
in
the
background
with
a
gentle
bran
cereal
quality
with
slight
dry
herbal
tinge
in
the
finish
overall
this
brown
is
a
quality
dark
ale
with
plenty
of
drinkability
and
subtle
dry
maltiness
yeast
breadiness
that
is
very
pleasant
this
is
a
beer
i
would
get
again
for
the
fact
it
is
well
brewed
clean
and
doesnt
taste
sweet
even
though
it
is
malt
dominated
d
not
awful
but
id
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
bland
and
not
exciting
low
c
d
imo
they
nailed
the
name
on
this
one
very
much
one
for
unwinding
an
after
yard
work
sit
down
and
relax
brew
a
nice
fall
beer
the
ofest
come
on
in
the
marketing
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch
but
this
is
a
good
beer
rich
and
robust
and
big
enough
to
carry
it
off
without
being
weighty
it
is
a
bit
sweet
to
want
more
than
one
right
away
but
that
is
alright
as
the
abv
is
starting
to
get
up
there
a
bit
pours
a
dark
brown
hue
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
get
some
caramel
licorice
and
molasses
in
the
aroma
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
dark
fruits
caramel
molasses
followed
by
some
licorice
hops
and
a
nutty
taste
in
the
back
very
tasty
and
yummy
a
rather
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
rather
light
for
a
dark
beer
but
has
a
nice
creamy
finish
that
makes
you
want
more
a
rather
enjoyable
brown
ale
that
has
a
slightly
different
taste
than
most
brown
ales
breckenridge
autumn
ale
is
a
dim
brown
ale
with
a
light
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
film
it
has
a
resiny
aroma
with
a
slight
note
of
molasses
its
very
wooden
and
a
little
roasty
its
pretty
light
bodied
kind
of
watery
but
the
finish
is
kind
of
creamy
there
is
a
lot
of
resiny
malt
in
the
taste
but
it
never
gets
sweet
dark
bread
crust
medicine
and
maybe
even
licorice
are
in
there
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
long
and
pretty
bitter
wow
this
is
like
a
light
version
of
an
imperial
stout
what
is
this
a
brown
ale
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
overall
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
foods
i
had
the
first
few
of
the
six
pack
alone
then
realized
it
was
better
with
barbecue
however
the
best
combo
was
with
pumpkin
pie
the
cinnamon
clove
goodness
meshes
perfectly
with
this
beer
blew
my
mind
makes
me
wonder
if
just
adding
some
spices
in
the
brewing
process
could
make
a
killer
brew
serving
type
bottle
o
solid
brown
there
could
have
been
a
bit
less
alcohol
in
this
but
it
wasnt
that
detectable
and
on
a
nice
fall
day
i
could
see
myself
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
like
the
other
breckenridge
beers
that
ive
had
this
isnt
awardwinning
but
instead
is
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
example
of
its
particular
style
this
is
a
welcome
change
from
the
other
fall
beers
that
seem
alike
after
a
while
bodymoderately
rich
and
creamy
sort
of
heavy
but
not
excessive
enough
effervescence
not
too
bad
actually
a
bite
from
it
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
not
really
good
but
it
isnt
bad
either
it
lacks
complexity
but
it
has
decent
drinkability
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
it
hides
its
alcohol
pretty
well
also
holds
the
effervescence
fairly
well
not
a
fan
of
it
for
the
price
point
is
all
full
bodied
and
delicious
this
dark
brown
ale
pours
a
sturdy
black
color
with
almost
no
head
nose
as
dark
roast
coffee
candied
sugars
mild
alcohol
and
fall
leaves
quick
crisp
finish
and
a
big
bad
body
this
is
perfect
for
the
season
the
lack
of
carbonation
doesnt
hurt
it
as
this
beer
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
mellowing
out
with
a
little
alcohol
tinge
at
the
end
not
a
typical
brown
ale
definitely
not
a
porter
this
autumn
ale
is
a
great
evening
sipper
one
of
the
better
breck
brews
the
beer
pours
a
deepamber
color
and
settles
fast
with
minimal
foam
and
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
smoky
wood
and
malty
hops
the
beer
settles
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
breckenridge
is
surely
becoming
one
of
the
best
american
breweries
overall
very
good
and
interesting
brew
o
i
enjoyed
this
rich
and
tasty
its
drinking
very
well
on
an
october
day
with
football
on
the
tv
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
the
smell
is
mostly
malty
with
some
subtle
smokiness
could
be
some
sweet
notes
as
well
the
flavor
starts
with
the
smoke
and
then
the
malt
dominates
throughout
the
finish
is
somewhat
harsh
on
the
palette
the
malt
and
a
subtle
sweet
sticks
around
through
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
light
this
could
have
a
better
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
good
flavor
a
few
improvements
would
make
this
one
a
much
better
beer
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
something
nonoffensive
that
could
be
used
to
help
bridge
the
gap
from
mainstream
beers
o
a
bit
too
watery
and
carbonated
smell
and
taste
is
a
bit
muddled
nothing
remarkable
about
this
one
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
good
cap
of
khaki
froth
little
lacing
scent
is
dominated
by
heavy
lightly
sweet
caramel
with
notes
of
grassy
and
earthy
hops
light
metallic
off
note
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malts
mostly
caramel
some
nutty
and
bready
notes
hops
in
check
as
their
earthiness
is
only
present
in
flashes
again
with
a
lightly
metallic
and
earthy
mud
taste
medium
bodied
slightly
over
carbonated
did
not
impress
with
muddled
nose
and
flavor
components
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
a
black
color
with
an
okay
tan
head
which
quickly
goes
away
the
smells
are
of
mostly
malts
not
getting
the
hops
the
feel
is
somewhat
light
and
watery
the
taste
is
okay
a
little
bit
of
the
malts
some
coffee
and
some
nuts
and
grain
but
overall
its
a
little
thin
and
slightly
disappointing
it
sure
looked
pretty
good
though
overall
i
got
this
expecting
just
another
oktoberfest
but
got
a
very
smooth
brown
ale
with
toasted
nut
flavors
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
with
almost
every
breck
beer
ive
had
i
just
wish
it
was
stronger
bigger
stronger
nosemore
diverse
flavorsmore
forward
flavors
would
make
these
beers
much
more
memorable
this
beer
fits
this
impression
as
well
too
bad
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
hops
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
slight
caramel
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hops
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
overall
a
good
sessionable
brown
just
feels
a
it
watered
down
or
something
compared
to
most
good
brown
ales
the
flavors
are
there
but
it
doesnt
balance
out
to
something
i
would
really
buy
again
malty
and
lightly
sweet
finishing
somewhat
dry
toasty
with
a
bit
of
malt
complexity
little
to
no
bitterness
fairly
straightforward
and
tasty
though
the
body
is
a
little
thin
supporting
the
munich
dunkel
theory
ok
would
drink
again
not
reinventing
the
wheel
but
not
every
beer
needs
to
what
ever
it
is
its
perfect
for
the
fall
overall
i
purchased
this
in
a
mixed
sixer
setting
out
on
a
search
to
find
a
good
autumn
beer
with
so
many
pumpkin
offerings
and
obnoxious
orange
labels
it
can
be
overwhelming
this
though
is
a
good
start
while
perhaps
not
the
best
out
there
its
a
very
calm
beer
its
in
no
way
gimmicky
nor
is
it
reaching
for
a
style
outside
the
brewerys
comfort
zone
a
solid
beer
another
pretty
average
beer
from
breckenridge
i
keep
hoping
one
of
their
beers
will
hit
the
spot
but
really
i
havent
found
one
yet
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
471
ipa
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
but
with
just
the
faintest
head
fairly
roasty
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
and
some
gentle
malt
a
little
thin
in
flavor
especially
upfront
but
the
finish
delivers
some
more
of
that
same
moderate
roastiness
and
dusty
cocoa
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
pleasant
enough
i
guess
also
relatively
gentle
in
the
mouth
with
a
soft
finish
certainly
drinkable
but
not
moreish
pours
a
deep
garnetbrown
tan
head
looks
nice
smell
is
a
smooth
malty
excursion
taste
holds
less
promise
roasted
but
the
malt
falls
feels
way
too
flat
the
hops
are
almost
an
afterthought
laying
low
on
the
back
end
finishes
watery
but
a
looker
o
breckenridge
brewery
is
definitely
hit
or
miss
with
me
this
was
definitely
a
miss
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
amazing
it
is
a
dark
redbrown
with
a
slight
creamier
head
i
smell
roastedness
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
watery
at
first
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
slight
hoppiness
on
the
finish
over
all
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
but
not
the
best
breckenridge
has
done
dvery
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
had
a
little
more
depth
i
think
that
slight
change
would
make
this
a
goto
seasonal
for
me
rich
coffee
on
the
palate
a
bit
of
a
metallic
tinge
heavy
malt
with
some
nutty
tones
interesting
mouthfeel
thinnish
in
the
body
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
really
nice
sipper
on
a
crisp
autumn
evening
yet
very
drinkable
so
that
you
can
have
a
few
and
not
be
overwhelmed
i
like
the
vanillaoak
notes
i
get
in
the
body
definitely
a
good
brew
to
have
after
rakin
as
the
bottle
suggests
i
could
see
drinking
this
later
in
the
season
as
the
weather
cools
but
i
might
as
well
just
go
for
a
stout
o
very

in
my
book
nicely
done
the
first
old
ale
ive
tried
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
the
beer
felt
lighterthinner
than
expected
the
beer
was
smooth
had
good
carbonation
to
it
and
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
i
will
probably
only
buy
on
limited
occasions
a
decent
beer
kinda
half
way
between
a
porter
and
a
brown
ale
only
complaint
is
alcohol
is
too
in
your
face
i
would
drink
this
again
if
offered
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
notes
definitely
not
an
old
ale
or
at
least
not
like
any
i
have
had
english
brownmarzen
with
a
slight
porter
like
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
overall
i
see
it
as
kind
of
a
meh
beer
easy
to
forget
and
nothing
worth
seeking
out
but
for
the
right
price
definitely
worth
a
try
i
first
tried
this
beer
at
a
local
liquor
stores
beer
tasting
it
was
by
far
the
best
maltfall
seasonal
beer
there
i
am
finally
drinking
the
final
beer
in
the
sixer
and
i
have
not
become
board
with
the
flavor
whatsoever
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
fall
seasonal
for
the
relaxed
craft
drinker
12oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
dark
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
smooth
dark
malts
burnt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
autumn
beer
i
may
need
to
pick
up
a
few
six
packs
of
this
while
i
still
can
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
good
a
relaxed
enjoyable
beer
tastetoasted
malt
and
caramel
faint
hop
bite
rather
flat
and
thinbodied
expecting
a
little
more
robust
flavor
a
bit
of
a
letdown
overall
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
for
the
style
and
the
abv
this
brew
goes
down
very
easy
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
much
darker
than
id
expect
for
an
autumn
or
octoberfest
it
has
a
rich
cream
colored
head
which
quickly
moves
to
a
thin
layer
there
is
some
lacing
on
the
glass
for
some
time
although
not
in
traditional
layers
with
each
drink
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
is
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
anything
else
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
roast
and
earthy
notes
in
the
taste
dry
roasty
coffee
and
small
hints
of
earth
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with

semi
dry
coffee
aftertaste
nice
coffee
like
presence
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
oktoberfest
d
one
of
breckenridges
better
beers
this
is
a
very
nice
fall
beverage
with
solid
drinkablity
even
for
its
rich
mouthfeel
drinkabillity
flavor
shines
as
it
warms
doesnt
linger
too
long
good
fall
offering
d
this
is
a
nice
autumn
offering
overall
and
one
of
the
better
breckenridge
beers
ive
had
drinkability
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
although
i
probably
wouldnt
session
it
worth
a
try
smooth
and
mildly
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
very
thin
which
adds
to
the
silky
feel
and
doesnt
distract
from
the
flavors
not
a
bad
beer
just
simple
and
tasty
could
it
be
bigger
sure
but
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
that
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
taste
follows
suit
with
the
nose
for
the
most
part
but
there
is
a
very
nice
notable
smoke
flavor
that
really
helps
out
the
complexity
of
the
beer
carbonation
is
low
and
the
alcohol
level
feels
nowhere
near
6
7
it
is
not
what
one
expects
when
cracking
open
an
olde
ale
but
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
that
i
will
surely
buy
a
sixer
or
more
of
next
year
surprisingly
delicious
and
very
smooth
good
job
breck
a
deep
dark
brown
color
pour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
very
toasty
and
nutty
with
hints
of
molasses
and
brown
shugger
and
just
a
whiff
of
alcohol
but
in
a
pleasent
way
flavor
is
of
malty
toasted
nuts
and
grain
powdered
baking
chocolate
rasins
and
spicy
hops
a
nice
little
hoppy
finish
with
faint
notes
of
coffee
at
times
medium
body
with
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
for
being
so
malty
very
drinkable
and
good
a
nice
try
flavor
is
powerful
and
rich
with
a
fruity
overtone
and
a
slight
alcohol
tinge
somewhere
in
there
quite
delicious
the
flavor
is
pretty
solid
a
bit
spicy
and
pretty
sweet
with
the
obvious
carmel
malts
dominating
with
brown
sugar
and
molasses
notes
revealing
itself
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
a
good
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
lets
you
have
multiple
beers
in
a
night
easily
well
worth
the
4
i
got
the
pack
for
havent
been
too
impressed
with
breckenridge
this
one
doesnt
help
d
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
great
fall
beer
but
cant
say
id
have
it
again
clear
dark
brown
with
an
extra
creamy
beige
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
chicory
cocoa
and
anise
with
just
a
whiff
of
honey
dark
roasted
malty
flavors
of
chocolate
and
black
licorice
with
mild
caramel
sweetness
and
mild
bitterness
make
for
an
interesting
beer
that
is
more
porter
than
old
ale
to
my
taste
buds
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
some
bbq
ribs
d
a
bit
too
rich
for
me
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
but
its
an
interesting
beer
d
i
thought
this
one
would
do
better
as
it
warmed
but
it
did
only
slightly
feel
and
drinkability
meidum
body
with
medium
to
medium
high
levels
of
fine
carbonation
immediate
finish
isnt
dry
but
after
a
min
or
two
the
mouth
is
fairly
dry
the
smokiness
and
roasty
toasty
notes
settling
in
contributing
to
a
drying
effect
this
is
one
i
can
see
myself
definitely
buying
again
a
good
beer
and
something
that
would
definitely
hit
the
spot
as
it
gets
cooler
outside
ill
mostly
likely
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
later
this
year
drinkability
this
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
with
a
big
dose
of
spices
a
very
good
beer
i
could
have
three
or
so
i
wasnt
expecting
this
style
for
an
autumn
brew
it
was
a
nice
surprise
though
i
am
still
confused
about
the
style
as
others
have
mentioned
good
beer
nonetheless
drinkability
good
enough
at
best
for
a
beer
but
never
once
did
it
make
me
think
oh
now
theres
a
taste
of
the
autumn
theres
a
taste
of
something
alright
but
not
a
taste
of
autumn
edit
still
trying
to
figure
out
how
this
is
an
old
ale
an
enjoyable
fall
treat
pick
some
up
drinkability
a
little
change
of
pace
from
the
lighter
marzen
styles
for
the
fall
seasonal
beer
styles
probably
will
drink
it
again
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
could
defintely
see
myself
drinking
this
brew
as
the
days
turn
colder
and
shorter
tastes
lightcaramel
iron
metallic
a
touch
of
scorch
and
very
gentle
alcohol
sting
fruity
esters
of
prune
pear
and
driedblueberry
modest
sweetness
dries
in
the
end
and
leaves
a
woody
sticky
in
the
mouth
flavors
are
modest
in
intensity
and
sweet
does
not
cloy
as
can
often
occur
in
a
beer
with
these
flavors
mdlight
body
and
modest
carbonation
decent
drinkability
scored
as
an
old
ale
which
is
clearly
not
the
appropriate
style
for
this
to
be
classified
here
on
ba
d
oh
its
drinkable
d
pretty
good
on
a
cooler
evening
but
a
little
too
malty
for
my
tastes
an
honest
but
otherwise
unexciting
beer
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
the
ale
appears
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
off
white
foam
average
looking
nose
and
flavor
are
of
lightly
toasted
earthy
grains
mild
caramel
slightly
nutty
some
chocolate
a
bit
spicy
an
old
ale
shouldnt
have
such
a
thin
body
not
too
sure
ill
be
looking
forward
to
this
one
again
come
fall
i
have
had
this
one
before
and
this
time
it
didnt
seem
nearly
as
good
as
i
remember
it
pours
a
medium
to
light
brownish
color
with
a
light
sandy
head
that
faded
fairly
fast
smelled
nutty
roasty
tasted
nutty
with
some
carmel
or
toffee
in
there
mouth
feel
was
medium
fairly
watery
end
decent
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
appears
a
dark
caramel
cola
colored
body
with
a
rich
forming
tan
head
flows
thick
with
a
nice
lace
that
sticks
to
the
glass

intricacy

flavor
has

driven
mild
chocolate
with
herbal
qualities
that
result
in

times
with
fruit
accents
and
mineral
water
hardness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
prickly
carbonation
definitely
soothing
on
the
palate
drinkability
does
me
alright
with
festive
qualities
of
a
winter
warmerold
ale
this
one
hits
early
in
the
fall
not
bad
at
all
that
bad
and
even
a
nice
mix
up
from
the
typical
o
fest
of
the
season
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
subjective
score
it
is
always
kind
of
an
overall
impression
this
isnt
the
best
of
old
ales
or
much
of
an
old
ale
at
all
really
but
its
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
thanks
again
for
another
great
box
with
plenty
of
new
beer
bill
d
gaining
a
recent
huge
respect
for
oktoberfest
beer
i
could
hardly
appreciate
this
as
a
fresh
take
on
the
style
as
an
old
ale
it
is
to
me
undoubtedly
american
a
nice
flavorful
beer
just
lacking
that
authentic
taste
that
really
makes
a
quality
english
ale
as
that
is
clearly
what
this
one
lays
its
foundation
upon
munich
malts
and
one
noble
hop
if
you
will
but
this
is
no
more
an
oktoberfest
than
the
milk
i
dunk
my
cookies
in
quite
drinkable
for
a
heavier
ale
though
it
is
not
really
that
heavy
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
that
much
there
just
wasnt
much
going
on
with
the
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
bottom
line
its
worth
a
try
but
its
not
something
that
exactly
grabs
your
attention
overall
this
was
an
ok
brew
the
bottle
reads
after
rankin
autumn
ale
doesnt
really
have
a
refreshing
quality
more
of
a
warming
quality
a
nice
change
from
some
of
the
fall
brews
deep
dark
brown
that
is
translucent
to
opaque
with
ruby
highlights
that
holds
a
tan
ecru
head
that
sticks
around
with
sticky
lacing
nose
is
molasses
and
chocolate
malt
with
a
subtle
nuttiness
taste
is
a
bit
complex
of
toasted
almonds
and
dark
fruits
like
sugar
plums
and
raisins
which
yields
an
alcohol
warmth
and
low
carbonation
perfect
for
cozy
crisp
evenings
i
suggest
this
brew
as
a
digestive
dont
let
this
beer
be
the
only
one
for
the
evening
as
it
is
not
sessional
leaving
lackluster
and
wanting
to
quaff
something
less
heavy
drinkabity
is
decent
but
nothing
special
overall
not
terribly
interesting
but
an
enjoyable
brew
d
its
a
pretty
decent
drinker
the
full
flavor
may
lend
itself
to
being
more
of
a
late
fall
sipper
in
the
cooler
weather
overall
this
was
an
alright
beer
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
anytime
soon
a
drinkable
beer
im
not
superimpressed
by
it
but
its
good
the
taste
is
such
that
one
would
be
able
to
have
a
couple
or
even
a
few
in
a
sitting
d
i
felt
very
eh
when
it
came
to
this
brew
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
it
much
at
all
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
ill
make
it
through
this
six
pack
but
i
dont
believe
ill
buy
it
again
edit
im
finding
that
this
seems
to
be
a
little
bit
like
an
oktoberfest
and
a
strongold
ale
blended
together
the
rating
here
is
nothing
special
but
i
really
do
think
its
pretty
good
stuff
and
its
become
a
seasonal
favorite
for
me
drinkability
is
poor
for
me
i
had
to
pour
out
this
beer
without
finishing
it
i
cant
tolerate
drinking
something
that
tastes
like
coffee
grounds
and
wouldnt
order
this
beer
again
unless
it
changed
majorly
overall
not
a
beer
i
wish
to
try
again
deh
this
beer
is
good
but
i
need
to
move
on
finish
is
somewhat
short
although
this
beer
is
a
notch
down
in
flavor
components
compared
to
a
winter
ale
it
is
significantly
more
drinkable
very
satisfying
before
trying
i
assumed
this
would
be
an
oktoberfest
but
smelled
and
tasted
quite
different
poured
black
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
was
a
tart
roasty
maltiness
with
slight
smoky
almost
peaty
qualities
to
it
taste
is
dark
roastiness
tartness
a
bit
biscuity
lightly
carbonated
and
a
touch
creamy
and
while
not
bad
the
peaty
quality
is
not
my
favorite
drinkability
i
think
the
sweetness
would
get
to
me
after
a
few
but
for
a
fireside
accompaniment
this
would
be
spiffy
deep
dark
brown
in
color
with
about
half
a
finger
of
brown
head
smell
is
smoky
with
some
chocolate
and
toast
maybe
a
little
coffee
too
but
not
much
flavorful
with
a
nice
smoky
earthy
taste
also
some
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
not
heavily
carbonated
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
nothing
too
exceptional
but
a
nice
solid
beer
this
beer
has
some
body
pretty
thick
really
and
quite
filling
not
something
i
would
go
right
back
to
but
i
think
it
could
get
more
interesting
6
months
down
the
road
decent
mouthfeel
d
ok
beer
nothing
special
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
dont
know
whats
old
alelike
about
this
it
doesnt
have
the
big
sweetness
and
theres
a
touch
of
roasted
grains
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
find
it
bland
the
undercarbonation
doesnt
help
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
least
it
goes
down
easy
out
of
the
winter
beers
id
call
this
one
nice
but
forgetable
dark
brown
color
with
a
short
tan
head
coating
layers
of
lace
with
good
foam
stability
aromas
of
caramel
and
toasted
malt
a
bit
nutty
and
grainy
very
tastey
higher
alcohol
is
hidden
well
touch
of
smoke
along
with
the
maltiness
works
well
smooth
lightly
carbonated
not
too
fizzy
or
foamy
happy
to
have
tried
this
one
but
would
try
something
different
next
time
drinks
pretty
good
but
make
me
think
coffee
stout
not
old
ale
so
i
have
to
knock
it
down
for
taste
deep
mahogany
color
with
chocolateybrown
head
sharp
aroma
of
coffee
and
toasted
malts
also
comes
through
in
taste
along
with
rye
and
grapes
strong
alcoholic
character
of
a
scotch
ale
shared
with
the
dark
complexity
of
a
winter
warmer
nice
robust
late
fall
offering
for
when
the
early
fall
crispness
of
octoberfests
give
way
initial
flavor
is
dominated
by
roasted
and
caramelized
malts
the
finish
is
the
best
part
hints
of
smoke
and
dark
dried
fruit
give
this
average
beer
an
interesting
finish
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
the
drinkability
is
ok
im
not
impressed
enough
to
buy
more
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
mk
absolutely
not
a
marzen
rather
has
a
rich
chocolate
malty
taste
the
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
brown
with
serious
dark
ruby
highlights
head
forms
a
decent
creamy
light
tan
crown
to
top
off
the
body
lacing
thin
but
secure
in
its
coverage
of
the
glass
nose
has
a
malt
sweet
aroma
supported
by
the
caramel
also
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
pokes
through
front
ambrosial
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
back
top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
has
a
lenient
acidity
the
hops
apparent
but
not
over
powering
sweet
dry
aftertaste
lingers
long
on
the
palate
a
nice
looking
aromatic
and
drinkable
beer
over
the
past
few
years
breckenridge
has
improved
its
quality
immensely
this
one
is
all
malt
its
an
okay
beer
i
feel
the
flavor
was
a
little
lacking
and
it
seemed
watery
nothing
was
really
off
about
the
beer
so
i
dont
think
it
should
be
avoided
its
worth
a
try
at
least
a
decent
beer
id
give
it
a
try
i
got
a
beautiful
pour
from
this
beer
resulting
in
two
fingers
of
thick
lighttan
head
the
color
was
a
deep
colabrown
with
lovely
garnet
highlights
the
nose
had
a
big
maltysweet
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
and
i
got
a
really
unexpected
smokiness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
slightly
sharp
quality
followed
by
a
return
of
that
smoky
flavor
i
just
wish
that
the
weather
was
not
so
warm
because
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
more
typical
autumn
day
this
beer
is
decent
but
could
benefit
from
thicker
malting
overall
impression
meh
pretty
mild
flavors
lend
themselves
towards
funky
earthy
leafy
roasted
i
was
thinking
schwarzbier
more
than
old
ale
there
is
a
light
tannin
character
that
seems
to
relate
to
dried
leaves
so
points
for
seasonal
character
still
its
not
a
terribly
tasty
beer
pass
old
ales
are
probably
my
least
favorite
style
this
ones
a
pretty
good
example
but
personally
it
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
breckenridge
autumn
ale
was
a
deep
mahogany
color
it
had
a
medium
sized
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
toasty
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
toasty
and
malty
as
well
with
some
roasted
and
fruity
flavors
coming
through
in
the
dry
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkabily
was
above
average
it
was
a
decent
fall
seasonal
and
worth
a
try
i
guess
im
way
outside
the
average
on
this
one
but
i
really
like
this
beer
i
loved
the
burnedtoast
and
espresso
flavors
my
advice
would
be
to
drink
this
above
cellar
temperature
at
least
50
or
55
degrees
has
the
recipe
completely
changed
in
2007
this
beer
used
to
be
a
malty
toasty
nutty
treat
when
fall
rolled
around
i
thought
it
might
be
a
bad
batch
but
i
see
other
people
noting
the
same
flavors
d
roasty
but
not
too
roasty
for
me
to
drink
only
a
one
or
two
i
expected
more
hop
flavor
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
a
nice
beer
almost
a
porter
cheers
d
my
first
old
ale
and
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
but
to
be
fair
i
was
not
expecting
much
and
so
the
beer
took
me
a
bit
by
suprise
which
had
its
ups
and
its
downs
mostly
downs
but
still
drinkable
in
any
case
overall
this
a
good
fall
seasonal
i
think
its
off
the
mark
for
an
old
ale
nonetheless
its
quite
a
tasty
little
beer
regardless
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
semisweet
of
toffee
along
with
a
nutty
grainy
mildly
bitter
finish
so
is
autumnwarmer
going
to
be
an
upcomming
catagory
its
not
quite
a
harvest
ale
because
of
the
moderate
hopping
not
highly
hopped
not
quite
a
winter
warmer
not
spicy
or
the
right
season
what
the
beer
is
is
a
really
nice
nonoktoberfest
falltype
beer
quite
reminescent
of
scottish
ales
but
light
on
the
peatsmoked
malts
but
on
target
with
the
deep
malt
profile
toffee
cocoa
hints
and
moderately
high
malty
texture
medium
hops
certainly
offset
the
sweetness
while
adding
a
mild
grassy
piney
flavor
fermentation
spices
and
lactoselike
sweetness
add
character
and
smoothness
lingers
with
a
hint
of
toasty
sweetness
and
hop
bittering
another
high
quality
well
balanced
brew
from
breckenridge
a
good
autumn
beer
breckenridge
autumn
ale
has
failed
to
warm
my
body
a
minimum
of
8
is
required
for
that
and
it
certainly
hasnt
warmed
my
soul
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
autumn
and
it
isnt
much
of
an
old
ale
whats
left
a
crazy
patchwork
of
a
beer
that
doesnt
fit
comfortably
into
any
one
style
but
that
is
nevertheless
drinkable
in
a
low
expectations
kind
of
way
a
better
old
ale
shouldnt
be
that
hard
to
come
by
this
is
my
first
experience
with
an
old
ale
and
if
this
is
any
indication
of
what
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
like
sign
me
up
for
more
of
this
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
personally
prefer
the
likes
of
averys
old
jubilation
when
drinking
this
class
of
beer
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
there
really
isnt
all
that
much
to
set
it
apart
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
ive
only
had
one
other
old
ale
so
i
have
little
to
compare
it
to
but
it
is
quite
nice
yep
checked
their
webpage
thats
what
i
had

i
would
recommend
this
in
a
hearbeat
very
nice
fallwinter
warmer
id
luv
to
have
a
couple
more
there
is
a
lighter
note
in
body
with
some
wispy
flavors
very
light
for
an
old
ale
but
good
overall
really
feels
like
a
light
porter
but
still
good
no
matter
what
the
season
is
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
some
deep
amber
highlights
large
amounts
of
dirty
tan
head
are
formed
and
have
no
trouble
keeping
up
aromas
of
slightly
roasty
malts
spices
light
floral
hops
and
malty
sweetness
abound
body
is
kinda
weird
as
the
carbonation
is
low
but
it
finishes
rather
dry
flavor
is
remeniscent
of
most
winter
ales
with
a
medium
brown
type
roastiness
and
some
spicy
finish
it
is
certainly
easily
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
i
would
be
interested
in
several
where
it
would
get
dull
quickly
look
forward
to
trying
this
when
the
cooler
weather
hits
a
leaf
rakin
autumnal
thanks
to
bighuge
for
this
easy
going
seasonal
ale
d
very
drinkable
not
one
to
ponder
over
but
very
enjoyable
in
its
own
way
kudos
to
breck
for
trying
something
different
than
the
usual
oktoberfest
seasonal
brews
a
nice
transition
into
winter
whatever
the
case
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
will
short
if
you
sit
and
analyze
the
hell
out
of
it
but
if
you
just
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
you
will
love
it
deep
burgandy
tone
thin
beige
head
lace
is
sparse
but
overall
the
appearance
is
good
on
the
nose
nice
toasted
malts
nuttiness
and
caramel
character
nice
the
palate
continues
this
theme
the
flavor
is
nutty
pretty
thick
with
malts
bready
and
sweet
almost
like
a
bock
in
nature
but
not
exactly
good
nonetheless
the
body
is
full
and
rournded
pretty
much
everything
about
this
beer
is
good
id
label
it
a
late
autumn
ale
very
late
put
short
a
nice
transitional
ale
as
we
regrettably
leave
summer
behind
and
embrace
richer
darker
tastes
its
already
chilly
out
and
october
looms
overhead
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
ale
and
very
welcome
in
my
glass
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
true
oktoberfest
style
but
that
doesnt
stop
me
from
buying
all
that
is
available
each
year
it
just
seems
like
the
right
thing
to
do
although
this
is
not
labeled
as
oktoberfest
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
though
i
knew
it
wasnt
deep
dark
mahogany
color
and
commanding
malt
aroma
i
love
the
uniqueness
of
this
brew
with
slightly
sweet
caramel
notes
balanced
with
toasted
nut
flavors
hops
hide
in
the
background
for
the
most
part
im
surprised
at
some
of
the
tough
reviews
on
this
one
i
think
it
makes
for
a
remarkable
transition
to
the
forthcoming
winter
season
sure
is
a
healthy
color
dark
brown
and
as
dark
as
a
guinness
pub
can
not
thats
a
huge
thing
these
days
one
quarter
inch
head
starts
to
fade
in
less
than
a
minute

malty
aroma
cinnamon
toast
seems
to
be
most
predominant
mouthfeel
strays
not
thin
but
almost
soupy
or
like
a
thin
stew
with
lower
carbonation
the
flavor
profile
rings
mostly
malt
not
much
to
pick
out
in
hops
but
its
muddled
and
dishwaterlike
with
initial
molasses
but
also
with
cardboard
back
tastes
that
dont
work
for
me
solid
enough
to
hold
on
to
this
profile
without
any
fade
it
doesnt
go
anywhere
that
nice
or
interesting
however
whats
there
is
tepid
especially
for
a
brew
that
could
be
classed
as
an
old
ale
and
not
that
good
tasting
at
least
imo
what
kind
of
beer
is
this
wacky
stuff
old
ale
sure
dark
maroon
colored
body
you
can
only
see
through
at
the
bottom
of
the

fades
to
a
small
film

slight
acidity
taste
is
relatively
bland
like
a
watered
down
underpowered
porter
in
most
respects
undercarbonated
body
very
thin
this
beer
was
off
in
almost
every
respect
although
i
am
appreciateive
of
the
effort
from
breckenridge
to
try
something
new

spotty
lacing
on
the

at
best
smell
is
rather
strong
and
of
roasted
grains
chocolate
and
fruit
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
astringent
tastes
upfront
of
raisins
cranberries
and
assorted
fruits
roasted
chocolately
malts
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
relatively
smooth
also
very
drinkable
and
at
nearly
7
abv
this
could
catch
up
on
you
pretty
quick
overall
its
a
fall
seasonal
thats
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
off

that
doesnt
last

pretty
color
but
not
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
i
found
it
neither
malty
nor
hoppy
it
was
not
as
good
as
their
christmas
seasonal
package
reviewed
is
a
12
oz
brown
glass
longneck
with
the
familiar
town
scene
on
the
front
label
label
background
is
pumpkin
orange
freshness
date
on
rear
label
a
perplexing
beer
with
the
caramel
vanilla
and
sweetness
of
an
old
ale
but
then
a
medium
tart
quality
hits
in
the
middle
along
with
cherries
and
dark
fruit
overall
very
tasty
and
complex
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
i
would
drink
this
any
time
it
presented
itself
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
unique
and
im
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
however
im
at
a
lost
as
to
how
to
score
this
appropriately
since
this
apprently
falls
into
the
grey
area
of
old
ales
and
whether
they
are
accurately
portrayed
as
boozy
malt
bombs
or
wild
ales
regardless
i
enjoyed
it
oan
interesting
take
on
the
style
not
one
of
hfs
better
beers
but
yummy
none
the
less
pour
is
dark
copper
brown
virtually
opaque
with
a
tight
small
bubbled
tan
head
nose
is
assertive
brett
strong
dry
leather
toasted
malts
caramel
and
a
touch
of
malty
berry
sweetness
taste
is
stronger
malt
and
a
bit
sweeter
brett
is
there
leathery
for
the
most
part
toasted
malts
and
caramel
mid
palate
a
fair
bit
of
cherry
sweetness
it
has
a
fairly
high
bitterness
through
the
finish
incredibly
soft
body
and
clean
light
carbonation
overall
it
doesnt
smack
of
an
unintended
infection
but
its
much
more
controlled
the
tartness
works
pretty
well
and
keeps
it
a
very
interesting
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks

overall
very
interesting
take
on
an
old
ale
and
i
like
it
its
like
an
old
ale
and
an
oude
bruin
combined
i
see
this
beer
getting
better
with
time
in
the

pours
a

expresses
tart
notes
cherries
and
a
suggestion
of

i
can

is
that
the

is
consistent
with
a
very
wellmade
flanders
oud
bruin
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in

with
a
light

overall
i
cant
really
describe
this
as
an
old
ale
however
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
o
old
ale
id
call
it
a
flanders
brown
haha
its
only
any
old
ale
because
well
its
old
lol
going
senile
in
those
bourbon
barrels
for
far
too
long
haha
aside
from
ann
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
brews
they
have
put
out
for
sure
probably
just
because
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
hell
i
dont
think
anyone
is
expecting
what
this
has
to
offer
a
very
solid
brew
lets
just
say
hfs
resident
microflora
really
took
over
not
really
sure
what
an
old
ale
is
but
this
comes
across
to
me
more
like
a
flandersold
bruin
sorta
thing
with
a
great
oak
presence
from
the
barrel
not
my
style
of
beer
typically
but
very
much
appreciate
this
one
i
think
folks
who
dig
flandersold
bruin
type
styles
will
really
dig
this
well
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
on
this
one
still
having
trouble
describing
it
in
the
review
definitely
different
i
was
expecting
the
bourbon
barrels
to
show
up
more
instead
they
mix
in
with
all
the
funk
lots
of
sour
funk
and
dark
fruit
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
one
to
be
sipped
and
savored
the
beer
these
beers
make
goose
islands
bourbon
barrel
heroin
addict
black
friday
marketing
beers
seem
like
lite
beer
great
balance
here
i
dont
know
if
youd
want
to
drink
an
11
5
old
ale
without
the
barrel
cutting
down
the
sweetness
this
pairs
big
fruity
dark
malts
lots
of
jammy
berries
and
caramel
with
dry
almost
crisp
vanilla
oak
notes
theres
a
hint
of
heat
to
remind
you
youre
dealing
with
whiskey
overall
a
wonderfully
executed
beer
over
all
i
wish
i
had
got
a
couple
more
for
aging
looking
forward
to
picking
more
up
next
time
im
down
south
very
nice
job
sta
as
someone
who
has
stepped
away
from
regular
draft
and
stepping
over
to
craft
and
local
brews
this
was
a
good
decision
i
like
the
taste
the
smell
and
not
to
mention
the
abv
is
always
a
good
thing
another
brewery
in
the
area
produces
a
similar
beer
called
wee
heavy
ale
it
is
even
worse
same
concept
beer
mixed
with
whiskey
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
that
doesnt
last
nearly
impenetrable
to
light
strong
aroma
of
bourbon
greets
my
nose
along
with
loads
of
dark
malt
the
taste
is
packed
with
sweet
bourbon
and
dark
malt
the
mouth
is
thick
and
chewy
just
what
an
old
ale
should
be
rich
dense
and
creamy
sweet
malts
dominate
the
nose
and
tongue
very
mild
carbonation
makes
it
an
easy
sipper
and
the
taste
lingers
for
minutes
more
like
a
fine
dessert
wine
notes
of
dark
fruit
mixed
with
caramel
and
dates
the
barrel
aging
does
it
well
adding
notes
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
but
the
alcohol
is
just
barely
noticable
seek
it
out
o
hell
of
an
old
ale
super
malty
with
nice
layers
of
complexity
only
furthered
by
adding
bourbon
barrel
aging
very
sweet
and
smooth
but
cuts
nicely
with
the
sharp
alcohol
content
big
and
boozy
like
the
holiday
treat
burbon
balls
in
liquid
form
its
a
sipper
and
one
i
wish
i
was
sharing
rather
than
knocking
back
solo
great
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
personal
fave
that
i
will
seek
out
again
to
be
fair
i
primarily
only
bought
this
beer
because
of
the
label
im
a
chemist
and
i
just
cant
resist
sciencey
inspired
booze
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
silky
unobtanium
is
good
stuff
for
sure
but
pales
in
comparison
to
its
cognac
aged
brother
illudium
still
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
the
other
couple
bottles
in
my
cellar
o
wonderfully
unique
appearance
and
world
class
aroma
ultimately
fall
short
with
the
overly
caustic
tastes
35
good
beer
the
abv
definitely
shines
through
good
with
the
pork
tenderloin
im
having
tonight
too
o
excellent
well
done
brew
bought
in
in
pensacola
fl
and
it
was
the
last
bottle
in
the
store
wasnt
able
to
find
it
in
alabama
or
even
in
birmingham
so
im
glad
i
grabbed
it
well
done
brew
not
sure
if
ill
ever
see
it
again
drank
aug
1st
2014
in
decateur
al
o
a
sublime
sipper
from
a
stellar
brewery
recommended
i
liked
it
as
much
as
the
illudium
o
very
glad
i
was
able
to
get
try
this
beer
wasnt
even
on
my
radar
but
my
trading
bud
offered
it
up
i
read
the
reviews
and
said
hell
yeah
and
i
have
no
reservations
what
so
ever
id
gladly
buy
and
consume
this
were
it
available
for
me
i
think
it
was
less
than
15
for
a
ba
old
ale
bomber
id
buy
this
all
damn
day
overall
big
deal
o
its
a
great
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
drink
it
cold
it
may
age
well
and
that
may
give
the
mouthfeel
that
extra
boost
o
the
barrel
nose
is
weak
its
a
solid
beer
though
and
the
base
beer
does
shine
through
as
well
fantastic
beer
that
becomes
more
complex
as
it
warms
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
banana
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
doesnt
really
give
off
any
barrel
aged
aromas
or
flavors
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
straight
to
ale
offerings
when
i
find
it
i
buy
it
all
d
i
wish
there
was
more
bourbon
character
as
it
might
cut
some
of
the
sweetness
might
appeal
to
lovers
of
english
ales
as
the
oak
is
more
in
line
with
something
like
fullers
brewers
reserve
solid
but
not
digging
it
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
reviewers
o
huge
dark
fruits
sweet
chocolatey
malt
taste
really
nice
belgianesque
brew
o
this
beer
was
unexpectedly
excellent
it
only
improved
with
drinking
highly
recommended
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
overall
a
real
treat
of
an
english
stockold
ale
i
highly
enjoyed
and
would
recommend
overall
awesome
brew
worth
trying
for
sure
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
stuff
from
these
guys
excellent
buy
it
o
enjoyed
this
beer
im
really
glad
a
good
beer
come
out
of
alabama
i
live
in
clay
and
would
definately
stop
in
to
drink
all
of
their
onobtanium
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
im
drinking
this
poured
rrom
a
bomber
into
my
ommegang
large
tulip
i
got
in
a
gift
pack
for
christmas
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
thick
and
heavy
bodied
perfect
for
an
old
ale
as
it
forces
you
to
drink
slowly
and
savor
the
taste
overall
a
really
flavorful
and
filling
beer
that
is
nice
and
warming
on
a
cold
winter
evening
one
last
note
a
lot
of
alabama
beers
be
they
from
good
people
or
avondale
or
what
have
you
are
overrated
by
the
local
reviewing
public
i
tend
to
find
that
alabama
beers
have
inflated
ba
scores
relative
to
their
quality
this
is
not
the
case
for
unobtanium
old
ale
im
not
a
homer
and
i
think
this
beer
is
absolutely
worldclass
o
not
something
i
would
pound
back
but
definitely
you
would
sip
on
all
night
amazing
complexity
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
mellow
feel
slight
alcohol
prickle
and
a
hint
of
spirit
woody
cherry
pipe
tobacco
ripe
bananaplantain
caramel
mild
bitterness
hints
of
bourbon
in
the
aftertaste
from
the
buffalo
trace
barrel
a
rich
sipper
that
i
had
to
get
seconds
of
very
tasty
thanks
again
guys
overall
this
is
outstanding
beer
i
would
love
to
see
this
brewery
do
well
in
the
years
to
come
d
overall
a
delicious
old
ale
but
one
is
enough
at
this
alcohol
level
o
at
1
50
a
bottle
it
gets
extra
marks
for
the
price
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
well
made
beer
not
without
some
minor
flaws
but
definitely
drinkable
this
is
a
dark
brown
beer
with
a
red
tint
and
relatively
little
head
the
nose
is
fairly
strong
treacle
the
taste
is
reflective
of
that
treacle
becoming
sweeter
after
a
while
and
then
slightly
more
minty
before
a
more
bitter
finish
simple
but
good
overall
this
is
quite
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
a
belgian
dark
it
isnt
quite
as
yeasty
an
stacked
up
with
fruit
esters
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
one
can
easily
find
the
similarities
in
the
rich
dark
fruits
spiciness
breadiness
and
booze
the
ale
is
of
a
very
good
quality
you
can
easily
tell
and
it
is
also
quite
a
bit
better
than
some
belgian
dark
ales
that
i
have
had
i
would
drink
this
again
and
am
actually
pretty
interested
in
having
the
chocolate
beer
they
do
as
well
this
is
a
tasty
complex
bold
and
pleasant
old
ale
surprisingly
drinkable
at
8
5
abv
500
ml
bottle
dark

with
a
small
off

head
that
vanishes
soon
leaving
a
small

chocolate
notes
of
caramel
red
wine
medium
to
light
too
much
light
body
soft
palate
taste
of
caramel
chocolate
red
grapes
this
beer
screams
mustiness
and
age
without
seeming
stale
or
unpleasant
it
is
a
very
interesting
combination
of
flavors
that
feels
a
bit
disjointed
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
once
seems
like
a
hitormiss
depending
on
your
particular
tastes
overall
quite
decent
wouldve
preferred
a
bit
more
refinement
and
a
slight
slight
boost
to
the
body
for
some
desired
chewiness
definitely
oldtasting
but
not
in
the
something
might
be
dead
and
buried
here
sense
of
thomas
hardys
or
the
like
that
is
to
say
more
fruity
than
musty
andor
dusty
and
lighter
in
bearing
at
any
rate
and
agreeable
enough
strong
english
ale
ageism
need
not
come
into
play
here
complexed
and
interesting
a
very
good
beer
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
the
robinson
brewery
pours
a
rusty
reddish
brown
with
a
small
lasting
beige
head
aroma
is
of
dark
malt
chocolate
some
gain
notes
taste
of
dark
caramel
malt
chocolate
light
bitter
notes
palate
is
a
medium
body
mild
carbonation
as
a
nice
sweet
chocolate
flavor
the
finish
is
a
combination
of
dark
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
has
more
of
a
chocolate
liqueur
flavor
that
lingers
with
light
bitterness
overall
a
flavorful
and
tasty
brew
o
good
beer
for
the
style
probably
would
go
best
on
a
cold
winter
evening
worth
checking
out
crisp
up
front
with
a
bit
of
smoothness
the
feel
may
be
the
only
aspect
of
this
beer
thats
lacking
it
goes
just
a
little
tinny
and
the
thin
body
cant
quite
support
all
the
heft
o
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
great
attributes
but
they
just
dont
quite
come
together
in
the
taste
which
is
where
it
really
counts
according
to
the
label
it
was
awarded
the
worlds
best
ale
in
2009
but
thats
hard
for
me
to
believe
unless
its
gone
downhill
in
recent
years
o
great
looking
and
the
aroma
is
unbelievable
the
taste
and
feel
fell
a
little
short
for
me
though

too
much

threatens

any

all
in

there
are

of
thinking
so
im
glad
i
bought
4
drank
1
and
am
saving
the
other
3
bottles
for
another
time
overall
nice
good
malts
a
bit
syrupy
but
not
too
much
bit
too
much
booze
nice
flavors
not
what
i
expected
from
a
uk
beer
with
how
big
it
is
but
the
hops
remind
me
it
is
malty
bready
and
tasty
offering
more
caramel
bananas
vanilla
with
smooth
malty
sweetness
carrying
the
weight
throughout
this
one
decent
sipper
higher
complexity
would
lead
me
give
higher
ratings
for
this
beer
i
remember
this
one
as
considerable
richer
and
fullbodied
goes
well
with
dark
chocolate
though
o
nah
didnt
work
out
for
me
not
a
horrible
beer
but
this
price
and
alcoholic
strength
makes
me
crave
for
more
very
classy
and
distinctive
strong
ale
d
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
a
little
heavy
on
the
dark
sugars
for
me
but
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
i
dunno
i
guess
its
just
not
my
thing
im
hoping
that
the
claim
to
have
ben
voted
worlds
best
ale
happened
long
before
i
was
drinking
ale
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
english
style
old
ale
an
excellent
beer
i
left
it
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
to
let
it
calm
down
and
id
strongly
recommend
doing
this
to
take
the
edge
off
it
had
all
the
sticky
toffee
puddingness
and
caramelised
fruit
notes
that
youd
want
from
this
kind
of
beer
but
without
being
overlysweet
what
i
shouldve
done
is
put
two
away
because
i
wanted
another
one
straight
after
and
now
i
have
to
wait
for
a
year
d
definitely
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
experience
which
i
hope
to
repeat
sooner
rather
than
later
recommended
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
for
a
longer
period
of
time
the
taste
changes
as
the
drink
goes
warmer
hints
of
dark
fruit
get
noticeable
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
dark
fruit
with
some
sweet
toffee
notes
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
toffee
earthy
hops
a
touch
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
okay
id
like
this
to
have
a
little
more
body
a
little
less
hop
bitterness
and
some
more
fruit
character
its
sweetish
but
i
think
it
could
be
stronger
i
love
a
drinkable
flavorful
solid
ale
this
one
fits
the
bill
it
is
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
malt
forward
with
a
little
fruit
slight
background
of
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
balanced
nice
malt
backbone
with
firm
bitterness
that
lingers
full
in
body
this
is
a
well
made
drinkable
ale
o
it
just
tastes
like
a
beer
i
dont
know
what
else
to
really
say
however
the
lengthier
description
also
makes
it
sound
like
an
older
endemic
style
of
american
beer
the
above
scores
are
what
id
give
it
as
a
california
common
it
was
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
if
youre
expecting
the
fruity
malts
of
an
old
ale
then
skip
this
if
you
want
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
this
will
suit
you
fine
6th
generation
stock
ale
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
no
head
there
is
a
sweet
light
and
crisp
aroma
the
taste
is
the
same
light
and
crisp
with
a
sweeter
flavor
some
apple
notes
the
body
is
rather
light
and
the
beer
is
overall
watery
overall
its
by
no
means
bad
but
nothing
too
special
pick
up
a
six
pack
for
a
football
game
etc
and
be
satisfied
with
your
purchase
my
initial
pour
produced
two
fingers
of
fizzy
rocky
frenchvanilla
colored
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
srm
9
with
nequality
clarity
nose
gave
off
a
metallic
twang
along
with
a
piney
hop
character
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
fullness
and
the
taste
was
odd
for
the
style
more
caramel
maltforward
than
i
expected
or
would
have
liked
with
the
hops
almost
a
passenger
along
for
the
ride
i
got
a
quick
wash
of
grassy
mintiness
on
the
finish
but
this
was
not
my
bag
especially
in
light
of
the
style
that
said
i
have
gathered
that
they
like
to
play
around
with
styles
and
such
at
sbc
but
they
need
to
play
just
a
bit
more
with
this
one
imho
ymmv
overall
my
only
complaint
is
the
body
being
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
its
a
bit
off
the
mark
as
an
apa
but
i
love
english
ales
otherwise
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
getting
a
solid
4
out
of
5
overall
pretty
average
apa
but
it
reminds
me
of
english
versions
a
solid
well
constructed
old
school
malt
forward
ale
onothing
special
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
up
front
with
sligth
spice
and
herbal
flavors
from
the
hops
which
seem
to
have
a
fruity
influence
alongside
the
yeast
with
slight
toasted
and
caramel
flavor
from
the
malt
base
with
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
me
it
does
have
more
of
an
english
yeast
and
hop
flavor
than
american
pale
ale
qualities
but
i
found
it
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
another
wonderful
beer
made
by
this
company
a
very
golden
beer
beer
a
taste
life
a
beer
you
want
to
keep
on
drinking
sbc
knows
how
to
make
beer
so
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
beer
they
beer
they
dont
make
mistakes
enjoy
and
drink
a
beer
when
you
look
at
it
in
your
it
a
strong
dark
yellow
color
not
a
water
down
beer
but
a
beer
that
a
worthly
to
drink
and
say
it
out
loud
i
drink
this
beer
and
its
worth
evey
sip
the
beer
pours
a
deep
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
decent
it
has
a
bone
dry
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
light
touch
of
caramel
malt
for
color
and
body
the
hop
aroma
is
adequate
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
crisp
clean
flavor
with
a
solid
malt
character
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
very
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
is
quite
a
mild
apa
if
its
even
that
lots
of
malts
with
a
minimal
hop
presence
whats
there
barely
nips
though
at
least
there
is
something
seems
earthy
and
restricted
biting
carbonation
easy
to
drink
sure
but
not
really
that
interesting
of
probably
try
this
if
it
were
on
cask
i
was
really
interested
to
see
something
by
susquehanna
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
but
this
seems
to
be
really
out
of
balance
even
for
its
overall
restrained
character
and
yeah
its
hard
to
shake
that
phantom
macrolager
profile
though
this
definitely
has
more
to
offer
lets
talk
about
marketing
expectations
here
they
call
this
a
stock
ale
on
the
label
website
which
to
me
says
old
ale
refreshing
abv
is
readable
and
the
ability
to
have
more
than
one
is
here
well
done

begins
malty

with

continues

with

overall
impression
of

is
of
a
nice
old
ale
one
that
fits
well
to
style
with
just
a
touch
higher
bitterness
than
is
usual
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
chewy
with
low
carbonation
and
a
sticky
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
very
true
to

old
ale
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
old
ale
it
has
a
pleasant
aroma
and
a
very
nice
flavor
aided
by
a
pleasing
mouthfeel
a
very
nice
winter
ale
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
o
a
very
fine
holiday
and
cold
weather
brew
pleasant
tasty
and
satisfying
the
high
alcohol
content
dominates
the
taste
for
me
very
aggressive
malty
finish
that
definitely
encapsulates
and
old
style
ale
perfect
body
and
great
drinkability
overall
damn
this
is
a
great
beer
i
love
the
toffee
and
the

and
the
nuttiness

recommended

hint

caramel
taste
slight

cocoa
roasted

overall
a

this
definitely
fits
the
definition
of
a
winter
warmer
excellent
to
sip
on
a
frigid
winter
night
brown
to
dark
brown
with
a
fair
amount
of
light
still
permeating
the
glass
a
fingernail
of
beige
head
coats
the
top
almost
entirely
i
smell
caramel
and
toffee
i
taste
caramel
and
mocha
in
this
rich
winter
warmer
the
body
is
chewy
and
lightly
sticky
had
this
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
color
was
a
rich
brown
average
head
not
a
ton
of
lacing
the
flavor
had
a
pretty
strong
boozy
finish
after
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
very
pleasant
not
bad
very
good
dark
smooth
and
balanced
tastes
terrific
paired
with
gingersnap
cookies
my
experience
with
old
ales
is
limited
but
from
what
i
have
experienced
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
well
done
in
my
opinion
the
nose
was
not
off
the
chart
but
the
real
experience
is
when
i
began
to
sip
it
the
beer
poured
very
dark
and
looked
appealing
from
the
get
go
it
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
to
make
it
enjoyable
and
lively
the
malts
kept
this
beer
at
a
enjoyable
sweetness
level
without
pushing
it
into
a
desert
beer
category
i
did
not
think
the
alcohol
was
hot
and
was
masked
by
the
beer
the
beer
changed
in
a
favorable
way
for
me
as
the
beer
warmed
the
bitterness
was
very
mild
normally
i
am
disappointed
by
some
seasonableholiday
brews
but
what
started
as
a
single
bottle
turned
into
a
trip
for
a
six
pack
for
me
very
well
done
gets
better
as
it
warms
had
to
come
back
to
rerate
it
i
was
very
whelmed
with
this
beer
just
whelmed
its
a
pretty
decent
example
of
an
old
ale
in
my
opinion
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
maybe
im
just
expecting
too
much
out
of
the
stylemy
palate
is
spoiled
by
so
many
good
riss
it
just
needed
to
have
a
bit
more
punch
for
me
if
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
i
think
id
be
a
little
less
critical
but
ive
mostly
seen
all
avery
beer
checking
in
at
around
1011
a
six
ive
been
unimpressed
with
all
the
avery
offerings
that
come
in
a
pack
and
not
a
bomber
just
my
honest
opinion
this
is
rather
dry
and
definitely
warming
to
the
chest
depending
on
your
particular
taste
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
solid
go
to
winter
warmer
gotta
have
at
least
a
sixer
every
december
nice
it
warmed
up
it
was
pretty
smooth
good
choice
for
a
cold
night
not
as
good
as
finchs
nuclear
winter
why
havent
you
hyped
this
beer
simplicity
at
its
finest
this
is
typically
a
favorite
style
for
me
so
i
had
some
expectation
coming
in
i
was
disappointed
there
was
something
that
just
did
not
work
the
beer
just
did
not
seem
balanced
it
did
improve
a
little
as
it
warmed
which
saved
it
from
a
lower
rating
okay
but
nothing
special
a
really
nice
beer
just
the
thing
for
a
chilly
day
when
a
stout
is
a
little
more
than
youre
looking
for
really
nicely
balanced
slightly
sweet
with
cherry
like
malt
a
little
spice
like
a
winter
warmer
definitely
a
good
winter
beer
and
not
cloying
or
overly
sweet
spicy
or
anything
not
all
that
nutmeg
cinnamon
nonsense
considered
an
old
ale
not
really
that
hoppy
like
an
american
old
ale
maybe
more
like
an
english
old
ale
not
really
sure
very
good
winter
beer
i
feel
like
it
takes
the
samuel
smith
brew
and
keys
in
everywhere
that
needs
to
be
keyed
in
until
they
got
an
even
better
beer
well
done
overall
its
no
north
coast
old
stock
but
few
brews
are
its
enjoyable
as
is
a
laid
back
wellattuned
brew
thats
easier
to
drink
than
that

high
for

seems

i

at

despite
the

not

a

is

12
ounce

a

gave
a
bottle
of
this
to
me
a
month
or
so
ago
so
i
assume
its
from
this
past
winters
batch
served
in
a
dfh

the
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
toffee
nuts
and
some
chocolate
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
dark
bread
flavors
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
i
liked
this
its
good
on
a
summer
day
and
would
probably
be
good
on
a
winters
day
too
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
not
as
dense
and
oily
as
some
but
has
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
color
is
a
dark
nutty
brown
scent
is
toffee

im
surprised
its
not

higher
here
its
a

drinkable

can

o
great

good
price
makes
me
proud
to
be
an
american
d
i
do
like
me
a
good
warmer
and
this
is
a
fairly
nice
one
has
some
great
robust
layers
of
malty
goodness
while
maintaining
a
lighter
more
sessionable
body
would
have
again
this
beer
lacked
some
balance
or
the
parts
quite
didnt
match
i
believe
avery
tried
to
turbinate
this
old
ale
but
it
did
not
work
out
well
it
came
out
too
sweet
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
old
ales
but
the
flavors
in
this
one
just
dont
suit
me
not
enough
malty
sweetness
an
okay
beer
the
flavor
is
rather
disjointed
and
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
weak
for
the
style
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
flavors
to
pick
out
all
suggesting
the
style
but
things
just
dont
quite
mesh
overall
a
decent
british
style
ale
overall
a
very
enjoyable
old
ale
beer
sometimes
it
is
good
to
refresh
my
tastes
buds
of
this
style
i
really
dont
see
much
of
thanks
avery
for
bringing
this
back
every
year
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
mahogany
color
body
with
a
very
small
head
ths
aroma
has
a
dark
fruit
and
cherry
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
a
deep
dark
fruit
taste
and
some
sweetness
also
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
overall
a
good
sippin
beer
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
m
this
beer
pours
thinner
than
expected
but
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
big
and
full
nice
lasting
roasty
sweetness
o
a
decent
beer
worth
trying
but
nothing
extraordinary
89100
from
my
tasting
notes
the
old
jubilation
was
definitely
big
on
the
malt
both
in
the
sweet
aroma
and
the
initial
caramel
dark
chocolate
taste
it
was
a
nice
big
beer
with
a
hint
of
booze
that
will
easily
keep
you
warm
during
these
cold
winter
days
this
beer
leans
more
on
the
malty
side
and
says
it
has
no
spices
which
is
a
big
plus
for
me
it
is
definitely
a
beer
to
look
forward
to
each
holiday
season
overall
solid
flavors
and
good
scent
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
from
the
carbonation
served
in
a
bottle
not
the
most
complex
or
layered
old
ale
but
it
is
balanced
flavorful
and
sessionable
despite
the
abv
my
only
regret
is
not
having
tried
it
sooner
good
one
avery
o
a
little
thin
and
a
little
to
boozy
to
be
ideal
really
nice
sweet
flavors
though
i
immediately
wanted
another
this
was
pretty
great
especially
on
a
particularly
brisk
fall
day
in
philadelphia
pour
a
dark
orangeamber
and
smells
of
dates
and
dried
fruits
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
with
appropriate
carbonation
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
shines
an
excellent
example
of
the
old
ale
style
with
heavy
malt
and
a
dark
fruity
taste
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
a
decently
wellrounded
old
ale
with
winter
warming
aspects
that
isnt
too
sweet
complex
and
enjoyable
what
with
the
elevated
abv
keeping
mostly
to
itself
im
glad
to
be
stateside
not
in
summertime
so
that
i
finally
get
to
try
these
kinds
of
offerings
overall
a
solid
example
of
an
old
ale
and
it
seems
to
be
still
drinking
great
even
after
10months
a
wouldnt
mind
a
touch
more
sweetness
and
a
little
less
earthiness
but
still
a
beer
id
drink
again

d
this
drinks
like
a
session
beer
so
easy
to
drink
im
furious
that
i
dont
have
another
tons
of
flavor
great
balance
and
no
problems
overallsaw
a
sixpack
of
this
asking
for
me
to
buy
it
just
a
week
ago
at
my
local
beer
shop
and
though
i
cant
say
too
much
about
this
beer
but
then
again
i
cant
say
too
little
its
subtle
and
hits
you
in
the
end
that
is
definitely
when
you
appreciate
this
winter
warmer
this
beer
plus
your
favorite
glass
equals
one
pretty
good
time
salud
the
old
jubilation
is
a
big
strong
beer
and
i
probably
did
not
try
it
at
the
best
time
i
was
having
lunch
at
our
local
watering
hole
and
it
was
a
warmer
day
which
i
think
plays
against
strong
ales
the
beer
poured
a
rich
deep
amber
color
with
thick
foamy
head
that
laced
the
smell
was
like
a
dark
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
malty
mix
that
seemed
to
give
the
presence
of
subtle
spices
like
a
cinnamon
ginger
etc
along
with
big
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
full
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
was
ok
not
a
huge
fan
of
strong
ales
overall
a
very
good
winter
ale
very
average
stuff
o
decent
brew
and
i
enjoy
the
take
on
the
holiday
season
with
the
addition
of
the
nuttiness
just
a
bit
off
balance
but
its
still
a
nice
drinkable
brew
not
as
much
character
as
i
recall
from
the
bottle
more
bitter
than
anything
which
is
surprising
for
the
style
lacking
in
big
flavor
and
esters
o
really
good
brew
this
is
a
2011
vintage
so
ages
well
i
think
it
gets
extra
points
for
that
great
smell
nice
flavor
this
is
a
good
one
from
avery
o
good
example
of
an
old
ale
the
taste
was
less
complex
than
i
was
hoping
for
but
not
bad
ive
never
tasted
bullion
hops
but
i
get
a
hot
piney
flavor
like
that
of
an
evil
pineapple
in
a
way
it
reminds
me
of
chinook
as
it
has
some
grapefruit
and
a
distinctive
note
that
i
can
only
describe
as
cat
piss
overall
even
though
this
beer
isnt
classified
as
a
winter
warmer
to
me
this
is
what
all
winter
warmers
should
taste
like
really
nice
drinkable
beer
dark
carmel
color
with
thick
foam
nice
lacing
that
hung
on
scents
of
chocolate
caramel
and
some
slight
grassy

taste
hits
you
right
away
extremely
smooth

chocolate
flavors
with
toasted
barleys
really
smooth
could
knock
back
several
of
these
high
alcohol
content
makes

just
perfect
o
a
fine
strong
ale
and
winter
warmer
although
not
a
favorite
old
jubilation
pours
a
muddy
brownred
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
malty
boozy
and
slightly
fruity
to
attempt
to
get
notes
further
than
that
is
an
effort
in
futility
the
taste
also
hints
at
complexity
that
never
quite
makes
its
way
out
behind
the
thick
wall
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
fruit
a
very
light
booziness
and
a
light
amount
of
citrusy
hops
adds
a
bit
of
life
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
old
jubilation
is
a
good
beer
its
best
aspect
is
probably
its
drinkability
this
goes
down
very
easily
for
the
relatively
high
abv
and
strong
malt
flavors
o
not
a
bad
beer
just

i
am
not

i
would

o
seasonal

can
be
very
interpretative
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
people
who
enjoy
beers
with
a
more
roasted
and
malty
character
a
person
who
enjoys
rauchbiers
or
stouts
would
undoubtedly
like
this
it
would
go
well
with
seared
meats
or
sharp
cheddar
cheeses
i
enjoyed
the
beer
especially
because
it
was
a
different
take
on
a
christmas
beer
i
felt
that
it
could
have
been
a
little

thicker
on
the
mouthfeel

pleasantly
surprised

picks
upthe
flavor
though
is
solid
and
very
drinkable

i
think
it
could
be
taken
a
step
farther
and
would
really
separate
itself
from
the
others
in

classthe

warm
my

the
higher

the

what
a

is

the

o
overall
probably
the
biggest
disappointment
of
the
season
so
far
not
bad
but
not
much
of
an
old
ale
mainly
just
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
more
of
an
extra
roasty
brown
ale
than
an
old
ale
in
my
book
which
is
disappointing
its
not
bad
but
with
so
many
great
winter
seasonals
i
dont
think
this
is
one
i
would
have
again
onot
a
bad
effort
it
was
a
touch
sweet
and
a
little
more
spice
would
have
balanced
things
out
but
the
alcohol
was
wellintegrated
and
the
flavors
pleasant
all
in
all
this
was
a
worthy
winterstyle
brew
that
worked
well
for
dessert
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
winter
beer
though
i
would
recommend
sipping
this
beer
rather
than
drinking
it
more
quickly
nice
complexity
to
the
flavors
and
smells
as
the
beer
warms
up
mediumfull
mouthfeel
smooth
carbonation
creamy
pleasing
feel
overall
maybe
not
the
heights
of
depth
and
complexity
for
this
style
but
its
quite
nice
and
an
apt
seasonal
selection
for
a
cold
evening
this
is
a
good
beer
one
to
drink
on
a
cold
winters
night
nice
job
as
usual
avery
o
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
ruminate
about
for
hours
on
end
about
how
it
is
like
an
onion
that
you
peel
and
there
is
another
layer
then
you
aint
gonna
dig
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
an
old
alewinter
warmer
that
is
all
about
comfort
food
like
rich
sweet
malty
goodness
with
a
cleansing
aftertaste
then
pull
up
a
stool
and
grab
a
glass
this
puppy
is
going
to
warm
your
tummy
on
a
cold
winters
night
pours
a
somewhat
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
orangebeige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
roasted
nuts
slight
cocoa
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
high
level
of
roasty
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
and
gritty
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
a
nice
smell
but
the
flavor
is
not
all
that
good
in
my
opinion
o
an
average
not
bad
not
great
brew
i
enjoyed
it
but
didnt
love
it
i
bought
a
six
pack
ill
drink
a
couple
over
the
next
couple
weeks
and
put
23
down
for
a
couple
months
just
to
see
what
happens
barring
some
unforeseen
improvement
with
age
given
lack
of
complexity
i
do
t
expect
it
i
probably
wont
revisit
glad
to
try
it
just
wanted
a
little
bigger
complex
brew
on
tap
at
my
job
pours
up
a
mahogany
clear
coloration
with
an
extremely
nice
off

stayed
with
it
throughout
the
entire

reminds
me
of
your

ive
been
a
fan
of
avery
for
many
years
now
i
dig
this
winter
brew
b
an
american
take
on
an
old
ale
pours
nearly
black
not
thick
but
no
light
is
passing
hardly
theres
a
two
inch
head
lacey
and
sticky
with
good
retention
the
nose
is
quite
alcoholic
lots
of
dark
roasty
malt
that
birch
syrup
flavor
is
there
a
little
too
akin
to
sierra
nevada
life
and
limb
flavor
is
curiously
dark
malts
they
are
sweet
but
dont
seem
to
have
any
of
that
bitterness
that
comes
from
such
dark
roasting
also
curiously
devoid
of
smoke
flavor
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
in
body
which
lends
drinkablility
and
makes
this
beer
not
feel
as
big
as
it
is
carbonation
if
mellow
but
adequate
and
the
alcohol
only
really
comes
out
in
taste
when
it
warms
this
is
a
beast
of
a
winter
beer
perfect
for
slow
fireside
sipping
but
a
6pack
would
do
you
in
one
of
my
favorite
avery
seasonals
a
great
holiday
brew
highly
recommended
for
any
occasion
avery
nailed
this
one
and
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
o
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
one
and
i
just
couldnt
find
it
in
me
it
is
fairly
drinkable
for
a
winter
warmer
yet
the
beer
is
just
to
intense
for
me
and
overwhelms
some
of
its
complexities
o
ive
been
seeking
this
one
out
for
a
while
and
now
that
ive
found
it
the
waiting
was
all
worth
it
such
a
smooth
balanced
old
ale
with
complexity
and
a
subtle
sweetness
that
makes
this
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
for
me
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
the
aging
rounding
it
off
nicely
although
the
fresh
version
is
almost
equally
as
good
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
a
strong
ale
with
lots
of
complexity

overall
it

and
a
good

of

roastiness
a
good
and
drinkable
brew
but
nothing
too
fantastic
i
am
a
big
fan
of
avery
and
this
beer
is
another
reason
why
they
do
a
great
job
o
id
try
this
again
as
a
good
way
to
break
into
this
style
very
easy
to
appreciate
o
old
ales
are
not
my
usual
bag
but
i
think
i
may
pick
a
few
bottles
up
this
year
to
cellar
for
a
bit
longer
than
this
bottle
it
had
lots
of
complexity
character
that
when
combined
with
the
drinkability
was
a
nice
surprise

pours
brownish
with
orange
and
ruby
tones
to
it
there
is
little
head
to
this
offering
and
the
nose
has
only
a
subtle
malty
presence
to
it
there
is
a
distinct
malt
flavor
upfront
and
this
offering
finishes
with
a
nice
roasted
character
to
it
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
tunedup

in
any
case
it
paired
well
with
my
pork

taste
is

mildly
sweet

reigned
in

dry
subtle

bitterness
is
there
some
coffee
in
here
too
chocolate
on
the
finish
too
mouthfeel
is
silly
and
well
crafted
perfect

very
very
good
i
added
this
bottle
at
random
to
a
make
your
own
six
pack
ill
definitely
revisit
it
in
the
future
jubilation
indeed
a
final
note
ive
always
known
this
as
a
winter
warmer
ba
labels
it
as
an
old
ale
while
averys
website
calls
it
an
old
strong
ale
hmm
d
a
very
nice
old
ale
thats
perfectly
appropriate
as
a
winter
seasonal
robust
and
quite
malty
with
a
measured
hop
bitterness
that
manages
to
stay
out
of
the
spotlight
while
bringing
good
balance
overall
pretty
good
but
also
a
little
too
standard
nothing
much
makes
it
stick
out
overall
a
decent
beer
just
not
a
real
standout

a
very
deep
mahogany
with
ruby
hues
very
striking
color
with
a
creamy
head
sitting
on
top
showing
minimal
retention
and
spotty
lace
the
aroma
very
sweet
caramel
dark
fruit
figs
with
a
touch
of
heat
the
taste
is
a
mellow
caramel
malt
with
some
and
nuttiness
and
toffee
sweetness
that
play
a
complimenting
balance
alcohol
is
slightly
present
and
warming
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
easy
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
on
cool
evenings
overall
i
wouldnt
have
minded
having
this
with
a
fresh
one
but
i
havent
seen
it
around
enjoyable
brew
for
the
season
hoho
whoa
i
dont
know
why
i
felt
obligated
to
type
that
forgive
me

i
havent
rated
the
beers
i
have
had
from
avery
very
highly
maybe
this
will
change
as
it
is
one
of
my
favourite
styles
tawny
red
ale
with
a
small
light
tan
head
and
plenty
lace
aroma
of
milky
bar
chocolate
and
some
caramel
some
nutshazelnuts
smooth
taste
of
coffee
and
cream
hazelnutswhite
chocolatefigs
and
some
whisky
fudge
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
gives
the
impression
of
fullness
but
its
actually
very
drinkable
i
liked
it
but
again
its
not
as
good
as
i
wanted
it
t
be
maybe
the
bottles
just
dont
travel
to
oregon
very
well
it
was
on
draft
at
mad
mex
for
2
75
for
16
ounces
at
happy
hour
really
cant
beat
the
price
but
id
never
buy
a
case
maybe
not
worth
the
hype
nice
bold
but
not
super
interesting
i
think
this
would
be
best
enjoyed
with
a
cheesey
meal
to
off
set
its
bitterness
of
alcohol
d
delicious
taste
is
malty
but
doesnt
share
the
depth
of
the
aroma
light
sugar
and
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
to
it
i
guess
some
of
the
figraisin
medium
smooth
body
overall
a
decent
beer
d
this
was
a
decent
winter
warmer
it
had
creamsickle
character
which
was
nice
but
it
could
have
been
better
executed
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
but
not
a
really
great
beer
overall
o
overall
a
pretty
boozy
beer
with
heavy
medicinal
flavors
not
very
drinkable
malty
aroma
with
a
malty
nutty
and
sweet
flavor
that
improves
as
the
beer
warms
up
definitely
better
at
cellar
or
room
temp
hides
the
alcohol
very
nicelyquite
drinkable
for
8
medium
body
very
pleasant
but
not
astounding
a
copper
color
ale
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
which
laced
nicely
clear
but
with
some
sediment
floating
about
aroma
is
malty
but
lite
taste
finds
this
beer
rich
and
malty
a
suggestion
of
toffee
its
smooth
but
gritty
too
gritty
for
me
drinkable
yes
but
with
loads
of
grit
or
something
almost
to
the
point
of
undrinkability
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
take
some
time
with
by
the
fire
its
got
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
taste
with
the
sweetness
and
spices
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
in
2011
o
a
hearty
ale
for
a
cold
afternoon
right
after
freezing
my
you
know
what
off
on
a
long
bike
ride
o
a
pretty
good
brew
but
probably
not
one
id
come
back
to
has
elements
of
and
old
ale
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
thought
of
it
as
such
with
a
blind
tasting
overall
decent
i
am
not
pressured
to
buy
more
and
see
how
aging
the
recommended
period
affects
the
beer
perhaps
because
i
have
good
beers
i
have
to
get
through
already
overall
this
is
a
nice
nonspiced
christmas
beer
with
a
very
boozy
warming
quality
do
i
guess
im
just
a
beer
drinker
who
likeswants
either
big
hopcitrusfloralpinebitter
flavors
or
big
dark
roastedcoffee
flavors
and
sometimes
both
of
those
together
or
something
belgian
this
beer
is
none
of
those
things
my
gut
is
telling
me
that
for
what
this
is
with
my
limited
experience
with
such
styles
as
based
on
my
preferences
i
generally
avoid
beers
like
this
this
is
fairly
good
its
just
not
good
for
me
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
the
standard
holiday
beer
a
solid
old
ale
that
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
overall
flavor
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
coupled
with
a
weak
mouthfeel
strength
is
probably
the
unique
flavor
profile
if
youre
into
trying
new
brews
o
another
massive
malty
winter
brew
im
appreciating
this
turn
on
winter
seasonal
stripped
down
and
not
dressed
up
with
any
outside
spices
and
flavors
just
beer
being
beer
a
good
hefty
winter
beer
that
reminds
you
of
a
wool
coat
overall
definitely
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
since
it
had
the
thick
body
and
smooth
abv
i
wanted
but
the
oak
and
bitterness
of
hops
was
a
bit
cloying
still
a
decent
old
ale
overall
decent
a
little
to
much
booze
up
front
and
maybe
a
little
unbalanced
to
be
truly
great
its
worth
a
drink
but
not
world
class
by
any
means
o
this
is
pretty
good
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
i
think
drinkabilityoverall
i
very
much
did
enjoy
this
beer
you
appreciate
the
dryness
as
it
build
up
more
and
more
as
you
go
this
is
overall
a
very
nice
beer
with
great
balance
i
think
i
have
to
now
start
searching
out
many
more
old
ales
as
right
now
this
style
of
beer
is
just
hitting
me
so
perfect
this
winter
overall
easy
drinking
bold
pleasant
brew
one
of
the
better
seasonals
this
winter
o
a
good
but
not
great
beer
enjoyed
it
but
will
not
seek
it
out
in
the
future
glad
i
tried
it
overall
impression
enjoyable
but
would
i
drink
this
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
winters
night
probably
not
not
as
much
body
and
attribute
as
i
wanted
or
was
scoping
out
this
brew
says
its
an
old
ale
but
more
the
most
part
it
was
an
ellis
brown
ale
w
a
bit
more
abv
and
malt
and
no
caramel
character
not
sure
what
to
think
still
an
above
average
brew
but
many
other
fantastic
winter
ales
i
would
go
for
before
returning
to
this
one
it
paired
very
well
with
stella
fontinella
cheese
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
old
ale
lots
going
on
and
lots
of
fruit
alcohol
was
present
in
the
nsoe
but
not
really
in
the
taste
something
id
certainly
have
again
o
this
beer
really
shows
good
flavors
of
vanilla
cherries
dates
some
chocolate
almonds
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
it
isnt
quite
a
holiday
spiced
beer
but
it
is
still
one
to
enjoy
by
the
fireside
i
recommend
a
sixer
to
get
through
the
winter
for
a
cold
day
i
supposed
this
would
be
a
decent
choice
since
the
alcohol
could
warm
up
anyone
who
polished
off
a
bottle
of
this
theres
not
enough
flavor
and
uplifting
aspects
to
this
to
justify
enjoying
this
often
but
once
in
a
while
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
down
without
much
thought
this
is
a
relatively
quiet
old
ale
and
for
anyone
who
can
get
past
the
amount
of
booze
in
this
this
is
a
sufficient
beer
for
this
time
of
the
year
poured
a
orangeybrown
with
a
halffinger
of
head
there
was
light
lacing
the
smell
was
nutty
and
pleasant
enough
but
the
taste
was
surprisingly
aggressive
and
bitter
especially
the
finish
i
wanted
to
like
this
because
i
like
their
other
offerings
but
i
didnt
even
finish
this
one
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
id
pick
this
up
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
it
nothing
spectacular
but
a
solid
brew
overall
it
wasnt
enjoyable
because
of
the
taste
i
like
avery
brewing
company
why
cant
they
do
better
than
this
o
decent
beer
i
like
it
as
the
third
or
fourth
for
the
night
a
little
unrefined
for
the
premier
drink
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
i
am
planning
a
holiday
beer
party
and
this
will
make
the
list
pours
a
brownish
red
hue
that
you
can
see
through
when
held
up
to
direct
light
two
finger
white
head
spider
web
lacing
the
smell
is
odd
at
first
i
get
a
faint
unpleasent
odor
that
fades
as
the
beer
warms
from
then
on
just
chocolate
and
vanilla
possible
oxidation
the
taste
is
far
better
than
the
smell
i
detect
hops
chocolate
vanilla
and
an
over
all
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
good
beer
for
the
holidays
must
try
enjoy
recommendation
get
one
overall
this
winter
warmer
uses
a
silly
amount
of
malts
and
it
really
works
the
complexity
of
the
drink
is
what
makes
this
winter
warmer
the
good
drink
it
is
if
you
enjoy
winter
warmers
this
beer
will
not
let
you
down
decent
but
not
an
immediate
musthavemore
bottle
a
palate
warmup
before
i
delve
into
some
10abv
beers
with
more
going
on
o
another
good
cold
weather
sipper
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
winter
a
good
winter
warmer
for
the
hop
head
as
there
is
still
a
good
hop
profile
even
after
a
year
this
winter
warmer
pours
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
head
fades
with
a
light
sticky
lacing
that
grabs
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
and
a
little
spicy
on
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
of
a
little
bit
of
warming
spices
along
with
some
sweet
malts
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
was
decent
id
say
its
about
medium
bodied
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
id
drink
it
again
but
it
wasnt
something
id
crave
o
this
beer
is
very
nice
it
is
the
best
winter
warmer
i
have
had
and
i
wish
this
was
year
round
i
will
get
this
as
many
chances
as
i
get
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
quaff
on
a
chilly
october
evening
im
sure
it
would
be
even
better
with
a
dusting
of
snow
outside
overall
it
is
good
winter
warmer
is
a
very
vague
catagory
similair
to
barley
wine
the
range
is
broad
this
is
very
malty
without
being
sweet
it
has
a
smokiness
to
it
that
resembles
a
scotch
ale
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
really
nice
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
last
year
and
stuck
it
in
the
cellar
and
now
im
curious
to
try
some
fresh
as
well
up
there
with
jubelale
as
a
favorite
winter
warmer
brownish
red
in
color
good
head
and
lacing
smells
of
some
piney
hops
and
weak
malts
sweet
malts
hit
the
tongue
first
some
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
hop
strength
in
the
back
like
it
warming
and
pretty
thick
for
a
sixer
beer
simple
does
the
trick
id
have
two
the
creamy
head
and
the
smoothness
already
mentioned
followed
by
the
hoppy
bitterness
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
the
alcohol
adds
to
the
overall
complexity
great
for
any
cold
evening
edit
woah
i
did
a
sidebyside
of
this
fresh
v
oneyear
old
and
the
yearold
version
is
simply
amazing
has
a
lot
of
barleywine
characters
sweet
not
hoppy
like
the
fresh
release
age
this
beer
good
medium
body
smooth
warming
and
enjoyable
very
good
beer
the
alcohol
here
becomes
more
potent
as
the
sips
progress
it
starts
balanced
smooth
and
drinkable
but
it
ends
warm
boozy
and
sipable
overall
though
its
not
a
bad
beer
to
warm
you
up
in
the
colder
months
overall
it
is
good
it
does
a
great
job
of
drawing
from
sweet
elements
without
actually
creating
an
especially
sweet
product
the
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
sensation
making
it
a
great
winter
beer
mouthfeel
thick
body
not
cloying
whatsoever
medium
carbonation
to
light
exactly
what
a
winter
warmer
should
be
maybe
a
bit
more
creamy
and
thats
why
no
ta
5
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
while
beeradvocate
lists
it
as
a
winter
warmer
the
avery
site
itself
designates
this
as
an
english
old
ale
and
i
can
definitely
get
that
immediately
after
sipping
it
the
roast
is
something
not
typically
seen
in
an
old
ale
and
i
think
it
works
great
here
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
at
all
but
in
a
sea
of
similar
beers
this
one
is
fairly
middleofthepack
o
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
ive
had
im
not
a
fan
of
black
licorice
and
thankfully
the
whiff
of
it
in
the
aroma
barely
transferred
into
the
taste
this
is
a
bit
more
bitter
than
many
winter
warmers
without
wandering
into
the
black
ipa
territory
thumbs
up
picked
up
a
couple
of
these
on
discount
as
i
guess
like
many
places
they
were
trying
to
get
rid
of
winter
and
holiday
seasonals
but
the
bottle
says
this
one
can
be
aged
for
up
to
two
years
so
i
put
one
away
until
maybe
next
year
around
this
time
poured
a
deep
brown
into
a
chalice
glass
smells
malty
and
bready
the
taste
is
rich
of
toffee
and
even
some
slight
chocolate
notes
with
some
nice
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
i
could
see
drinking
this
on
a
cold
night
around
the
holidays
overall
its
a
decent
brew
i
enjoyed
it
but
curious
to
see
what
some
cellaring
time
will
do
for
it
the
color
of
this
holiday
brew
is
a
semitransparent
dark
brown
with
a
fair
tan
head
and
good
lacing
and
placing
a
finger
aside
of
my
nose
i
detect
a
mild
evergreen
aroma
over
a
stoutlike
charcoal
malt
theres
a
near
cherry
spritz
to
it
pretty
decent
the
palate
finds
deep
licorice
malt
and
more
evergreen
it
blends
nicely
with
a
unique
herbal
sweetness
this
may
not
be
everyones
favorite
but
im
liking
it
its
medium
to
full
bodied
with
very
subtle
but
effective
carbonation
resulting
in
a
heavy
near
chewy
feel
this
is
pretty

it

very
enjoyable
and
recommended
for
your
holiday
pleasure
or
a
cool
june
night
like
tonight
o
pretty
good
a
different
take
on
a
winter
warmer
and
it
would
definitely
warm
me
up
in
the
middle
of
winter
do
this
beer
is
appealing
in
conceptstrong
and
malty
but
with
the
omission
of
those
troublesome
spices
that
are
meant
to
invoke
the
spirit
of
wassail
only
to
trip
up
so
many
winter
warmers
unfortunately
the
transient
urea
notes
take
one
completely
out
of
the
experience
limiting
enjoyment
still
it
is
not
without
its
charms
considering
it
is
an
avery
product
it
may
be
considered
a
qualified
success
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
one
that
is
so
complex
great
for
sipping
by
the
fire
in
the
winter
i
would
recommend
this
one
as
something
different
to
try
later
in
the
evening
the
taste
and
the
abv
are
a
little
too
much
to
start
the
night
with
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
the
aroma
has
hints
of
roasted
nuts
chocolate
and
raisins
the
flavor
has
a
mix
of
toast
brandy
and
a
coffee
note
and
a
bit
of
brandy
its
got
a
creamy
full
mouthfeel
and
a
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
avery
old
jubilation
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
a
bit
too
much
like
brandy
not
recommended
o
really
nice
example
of
a
winter
warmer
ill
definitely
look
for
this
next
winter
not
my
favorite
offering
from
avery
too
reminiscient
of
deschutes
winter
beer
o
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
winter
offering
for
a
long
time
and
really
enjoy
to
give
it
the
proper
respect
that
it
deserves
here
on
ba
as
it
is
well
balanced
and
an
all
around
great
brew
my
most
found
memories
of
this
brew
are
when
i
got
back
from
a
week
long
backcounty
ski
tour
in
the
southeastern
san
juan
mountains
of
colorado
with
not
a
drop
of
beer
sitting
at
home
and
kicking
up
my
feet
with
this
brew
had
truly
made
a
deep
connection
great
beer
one
of
the
seasons
best
offerings
a
good

this
is
a

is

to
make

as

was
fairly
subtle
to
begin
with
grew
to
a
spicy
tangy
sweetness
over
time
felt
great
in
the
mouth
coated
extremely
well
just
the
way
a
winter
warmer
should
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
pleasure
to
drink
not
a
session
beer
but
a
solid
sipper
that
made
me
want
more
da
very
enjoyable
warmer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
for
my
palate
highly
drinkable

a
spiced

could

this
is
not
my
favorite
type
of
brew
by
compliments
the
style
well
it
pours
a
deep
brown
with
nice
amber
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
dominated
with
rich
toffee
and
molasses
notes
that
are
lifted
into
you
nostrils
on
a
cloud
of
ethanol
vapors
thick
body
but
the
heavy
flavors
make
it
a
definite
sipping
beer
d
i
could
certainly
knock
several
of
these
back
despite
the
high
abv
just
an
excellent
balanced
beer
cellaring
this
beer
for
a
year
didnt
hurt
it
one
bit
my
only
disappointment
was
that
i
was
not
able
to
find
a
2010
vintage
which
was
why
i
saved
this
from
last
year
to
contemporaneously
compare
this
to
highly
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
pours
blackened

with
red
edges

a
white

that

dark

slight
chocolate
and
caramel
tastes

hop
bitterness
towards
the

but
it
is
still
overwhelmed
by
the
dark
malts
medium
carbonation
in
a
medium
bodied
brew
the
booze
is
hidden
well
behind
this
syrupy
malt
bomb
but
an
enjoyable
winter
warmer
all
around
t
a
very
drinkable
beer
unfortunately
i
only
have
this
one
left
plus
one
in
the
cellar
so
i
wont
be
having
more
any
time
soon
as
im
curious
what
the
malts
will
do
over
a
six
month
period
or
so
cellerable
for
3
years
interesting
might
be
worth
it
as
is
a
slightly
above
average
taste
with
a
nice
malt
profile
for
cellar
potential
and
it
does
have
a
great
mouthfeel
great
winter
time
brew
i
always
look
forward
to
old
jubilation
the
flavors
arent
in
your
face
just
subtle
and
tasty
recommended
overall
this
ones
ok
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
but
nice
enough
to
try
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
rich
dark
brown
appearance
with
a
frothy
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
a
nice
combination
of
malt
with
the
customary
winter
spices
flavor
is
heavy
and
rich
malt
with
a
lot
of
pungency
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
it
has
a
medium
body
that
is
more
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
has
a
little
bit
of
a
chewy
quality
to
it
it
has
a
creamy
quality
to
it
and
warms
the
mouth
not
balanced
enough
to
revisit
in
my
opinion
will
not
revisit
appearantly
this
beer
is
cellarable
for
3
years
this
blend
from
colorado
only
uses
rocky
moutain
water
which
lends
to
its
pureness
d
really
great
winter
warmer
and
goes
down
easily
a
beer
with
good
drinkability
for
cold
winter
nights
i
usually
turn
to
a
big
old
imperial
stouts
for
comfort
on
a
chilly
evening
but
i
wouldnt
mind
knocking
back
one
of
these
to
mix
things
up
not
bad
for
my
first
winter
warmer
d
very
high
the
alcohol
taste
is
present
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
expect
from
a
higher
abv
beer
it
is
masked
pretty
well
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
overall
a
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
ive
had
beers
that
do
a
better
job
warming
but
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
in
front
of
a
fire
with
very
full
smell
and
taste
bravo
overall
smell
was
not
very
good
in
this
one
but
everything
else
was
very
enjoyable
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
it
is
really
good
and
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
by
a
fire
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
sink
in
boulder
good
chocolate
smell
very
good
flavor
chocolate
raisin
and
coffee
not
too
carbonated
and
lighter
than
i
expected
very
drinkable
and
recommended
i
need
to
get
around
to
trying
more
avery
brews
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
dark
brew
that
is
not
too
intense
this
is
the
ticket
they
had
deep
purple
in
rock
playing
one
of
my
favorite
records
and
one
that
goes
well
with
this
brew
excellent
drinkability
for
the
style
moderate
alcohol
presence
is
somewhat
masked
and
a
six
pack
of
these
would
make
for
a
nice
relaxing
evening
indeed
the
beer
has
character
though
i
was
expecting
something
sweeter
darker
and
even
heavier
d
a
hearty
winter
warmer
with
a
stronger
roasted
malt
profile
than
most
assertive
and
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
winter
offering
but
a
unique
take
on
the
style
that
i
had
no
problem
finishing
d
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
wow
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
on
this
one
a
great
winter
warmer
one
of
my
favorites
for
sure
similar
to
an
old
ale
i
look
forward
to
this
one
every
winter
seems
like
its
always
gone
too
early
a
winter
warmer
without
spices
done
in
the
tradition
of
a
english
strong
old
ale
style
this
beer
is
dark
brown
color
deep
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
fairly
low
carbonation
with
only
about
a
finger
of
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
roasted
nutty
malts
and
mild
earthy
hops
the
flavor
lacked
the
balance
of
the
aroma
though
i
thought
the
roasted
malts
took
over
and
had
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
taste
its
a
good
refined
medium
bodied
beer
but
lacks
the
drinkability
of
other
winter
warmers
ive
had
very
malty
caramel
and
toasted
slight
chocolate
there
seems
like
theres
something
of
a
spice
to
it
but
it
may
just
be
some
longchain
alcohols
throwing
some
scent
the
chocolate
is
a
nice
competitor
the
slight
sweetness
nice
pine
hop
supplement
really
enjoyable
beer
drink
a
very
good
rep
of
the
style
i
need
to
go
get
another
one
to
age
it
this
one
was
pretty
easy
to
finish
and
esp
good
for
those
who
enjoy
their
beer
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
equation
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
toffee
and
some
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
more
complex
i
get
some
chocolate
and
toffee
but
i
also
get
anise
coffee
cinnamon
roasted
malt
and
some
alcohol
full
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
smooth
and
full
mouthfeel
the
strong
abv
is
apparent
but
not
harsh
at
the
time
of
this
review
ol
jubey
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
this
style
thats
why
i
shelled
out
the
9
for
a
6er
overall
this
is
probably
the
most
unique
winter
warmer
ive
tried
and
a
damn
fine
ale
overall
impression
bland
average
winter
warmer
wouldnt
drink
on
a
regular
basis
d
outside
of
the
odd
aftertaste
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
was
excited
to
find
this
beer
from
avery
as
i
usually
enjoy
their
offerings
however
with
all
the
christmas
ales
on
the
market
continues
throughout
entire
drink
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again

couldnt
think
of
a
better
brew
to
enjoy
while
warming
up
after
crosscountry
skiing
this
beer
features
a
multifaceted
flavor
that
shows
more
of
itself
with
every
sip
with
that
candied
cherries
there
is
a
strong
note
of

that
must
be
the
alcohol
lots
of
fine

that
scrub
at

got
more

the

warmed
you
defintely

was
there
the

after
the
beer
goes
down
its
the
spices
and
hops
that
linger
on
the
palate
that
takes
away
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
keep
in
mind
though
spices
earth
but
it
is
a
solid
brew
that
is
worth
a
shot

saw
this
brew
tonight
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
sweet
a
bit
more
abv
and
sweet
malts
this
beer
pours
a
fairly
clear
dark
brown
with
nice
amber
highlights
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
roasty
some
dark
fruit
fruity
esters
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
rather
sour
moderately
maltysome
roast
and
dark
fruit
there
is
a
also
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
and
mediumlow
bitterness
the
body
and
carbonation
are
medium
the
overly
sour
nature
of
the
beer
leads
to
low
drinkability
overall
i
could
not
get
past
the
sour
flavor
i
think
the
bottle
may
have
been
a
bad
one
but
ive
had
oldoxidized
beer
before
and
that
is
not
the
case
here
a
disappointment
from
a
brewery
that
has
satisfied
me
in
the
past
overall
this
was
easily
my
favorite
of
all
the
winter
beers
i
have
had
so
far
this
year
almost
perfectly
created
you
really
could
not
go
wrong
here
i
would
have
gladly
put
down
a
few
more
of
these
as
they
were
just
that
good
a
very
solid
offering
and
one
that
is
sure
to
please
i
would
have
to
highly
recommend
this
one
best
winter
warmer
yet
there
are
other
seasonals
that
i
like
better
but
for
the
style
this
is
it
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
best
winter
warmer
i
have
ever
had
and
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
in
fact
its
probably
my
least
favoritre
style
so
for
a
beer
like
this
to
impress
me
is
seldom
seen
overall
thebest
winter
warmer
ive
had
nice
for
xmas
eve
worth
trying
and
possibly
aging
to
calm
the
lingering
bitterness
will
age
my
other
bottle
m
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
despite
any
critical
remarks
in
my
review
its
really
a
solid
beer
for
whatever
reason
the
flavor
just
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
d
pretty
good
for
a
pretty
heavy
offering
i
didnt
feel
myself
getting
bogged
down
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
poired
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
white
1
finger
head
and
minimal
laceing
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
overall
taste
was
a
strong
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
very
watery
and
light
and
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
decent
if
i
can
buy
a
single
i
would
go
that
route
but
personally
wouldnt
drink
an
entire
6pack
of
this
stuff
its
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
recomend
somone
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
make
the
effort
to
find
this
beer
anywhere
if
its
not
readily
available
in
your
area
overall
a
very
nice
winter
beer
seasonal
spices
and
warming
alcohol
make
this
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
anyone
looking
to
try
and
cellar
this
i
recommend
as
this
was
a
2006
drinkability
is
good
nice
winter
warmer
that
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
at
a
local
store
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
nice
beer
for
the
cold
weather
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
initially
with
a
nice
warm
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
the
carbonation
and
the
fruity
finish
make
for
a
refreshing
example
of
a
winter
warmer
this
is
quite
good
yet
another
gem
from
the
hopped
haven
that
is
avery
ill
certainly
grab
a
couple
sixers
for
storage
since
im
sure
this
winter
warmer
will
be
needed
to
beat
back
the
midwestern
cold
delicious
pours
a
clear
redtinted
amber
capped
with
a
fluffy
tanish
head
that
settles
slowly
and
leaves
decent
lace
the
nose
has
a
bit
plum
like
sweetness
and
plenty
of
spicy
piney
hops
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
nose
on
the
palate
malt
sweetness
is
shortlived
before
giving
way
to
the
strong
hops
flavors
and
mediumhigh
bitterness
alcohol
has
a
definite
biting
presence
and
sticks
in
the
mouth
for
the
short
bitter
finish
medium
and
light
carbonation
mouthfeel
with
large
alcohol
presence
drinks
fairly
easily
for
the
abv
but
makes
a
nice
sipper
the
high
bittering
and
alcohol
keep
it
from
being
greatly
sessionable
but
a
few
of
these
would
certainly
warm
a
cold
winter
night
overall
a
nice
winter
ale
cheers
very
dark
brown
with
a
soapsud
beige
head
had
to
pour
kind
of
aggressively
to
get
the
head
to
show
up
whoa
it
smells
like
alcohol
just
pouring
it
im
getting
some
dried
fruit
smells
here
too
and
some
kind
of
funkiness
not
exactly
breadmaybe
kind
of
chocolatey
ok
on
to
the
taste
doesnt
feel
as
heavy
in
my
mouth
as
a
stout
or
a
porter
but
its
not
light
bodied
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
a
little
taste
of
hops
back
there
and
a
little
taste
of
alcohol
but
its
not
overwhelming
like
i
expected
from
the
pour
im
not
getting
a
lot
on
the
front
end
maybe
some
chocolate
and
bread
flavors
like
the
smell
again
this
is
a
tasty
beera
little
different
than
i
expected
but
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
this
style
looks
like
i
have
more
research
to
do
this
winter
poured
almost
black
but
not
quite
not
much
head
smelled
like
a
lot
of
hops
and
a
little
spicy
some
plumlike
fruittyness
i
havent
had
many
of
the
winter
warmer
style
but
this
brew
was
a
lot
hoppier
than
i
expected
to
the
ipa
level
even
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
as
i
love
hops
but
while
the
beer
was
still
cold
the
spices
were
barely
detectable
at
all
as
it
warmed
a
bit
of
cinnamon
emerged
and
thats
about
all
tasted
like
a
victory
hop
devil
but
with
a
more
snappy
spice
taste
regardless
though
this
one
was
real
tasty
effectively
hidden
alcohol
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
wish
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
instead
of
a
single
12
oz
recommended
d
pretty
good
no
alcohol
tastefeel
poured
a
beautiful
deep
red
with
an
inch
head
that
had
good
staying
power
and
left
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
pint
aroma
was
failry
sweet
initial
taste
is
almost
but
not
quite
cloyingly
sweet
with
hints
of
raisins
and
prunes
on
the
finish
the
alcohol
shows
itself
just
a
bit
in
heat
but
just
enough
to
make
this
a
real
warming
winter
ale
one
of
the
best
winter
beers
ive
had
must
find
more
tastes
mainly
of
sweet
doughy
caramelized
malt
and
appley
plummy
whiskeylike
solvent
some
balancing
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
but
solventy
fusel
alcohol
andor
esters
dominates
the
finish
certainly
warming
and
oddly
alluring
but
in
an
edgar
allan
poe
way
not
a
jubilation
way
dark
brown
appearance
with
ruby
red
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
lingers
smells
of
malts
toffee
and
spices
maybe
a
hint
of
cinnamon
fruity
esters
and
some
citrus
hops
tastes
malty
pretty
sweet
and
a
definite
hop
presence
that
isnt
overwhelming
but
was
unexpected
a
little
alcoholic
but
i
couldnt
really
tell
it
was
8
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
one
of
those
beers
that
is
kind
of
a
sipper
because
of
all
the
flavor
but
you
cant
take
it
away
from
your
mouth
so
the
drinkability
is
above
average
for
the
style
would
definitely
buy
again
poured
ambergarnet
with
a
rich
creamy
head
smelled
of
wholegrain
bread
and
sunflower
seeds
with
some
nice
fruity
esters
and
hop
bitterness
flavors
of
whole
grain
bread
mingled
with
a
hop
bite
and
metallic
undertones
some
nice
sharp
fruity
hop
layers
occupy
the
taste
buds
for
the
majority
of
the
taste
the
alcohol
is
late
in
coming
and
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
really
is
noticeable
only
after
a
few
sips
as
it
begins
to
warm
the
insides
the
low
point
of
this
beer
was
the
distracting
metallic
aftertaste
but
eventually
the
8
abv
takes
over
and
warms
the
insides
all
is
forgotten
i
havent
had
too
much
experience
with
avery
brews
but
their
winter
warmer
was
an
excellent
foray
if
they
hit
home
runs
like
this
often
i
might
have
to
put
them
into
my
regular
rotation
md
carbonation
is
spot
on
in
this
one
with
a
medium
body
that
is
a
little
thin
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
although
i
get
the
feeling
that
the
8
will
catch
up
with
you
sooner
rather
than
later
the
color
was
a
medium
deep
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
when
poured
very
little
foam
but
what
little
foam
their
was
left
a
little
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
and
alcohol
to
finish
out
the
aroma
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
medium
hops
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
overpowering
on
the
flavor
but
well
balanced
i
would
think
to
let
it
rest
a
couple
of
months
and
would
even
be
more
complex
than
it
is
now
i
like
it
another
winner
from
avery
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
during
the
season
awesome
example
of
the
style
t
the
taste
almost
seems
to
have
some
chocolate
notes
in
it
with
some
very
vague
fruit
its
a
good
beer
with
a
well
balanced
taste
nothing
insane
nothing
too
mellow
just
around
good
drinkability
sit
by
the
fire
and
realx
it
might
take
you
a
while
to
finish
this
one
with
its
heavy
alcohol
presence
and
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sipping
beer
i
might
try
it
with
a
rich
smoked
chipotle
barbeque
dish
or
maybe
a
spicy
chinese
food
but
it
might
be
best
by
itself
after
dinner
d
a
fantastic
sipper
even
if
it
gets
to
room
teperature
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
onefinger
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
bit
smells
of
roasted
malts
tastes
of
malts
some
raisins
a
slight
bit
of
coffee
and
almonds
mouthfeel
is
smooth
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
being
wellhidden
at
first
with
some
slight
heat
at
the
end
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
day
like
this
not
my
favorite
winter
brew
i
would
reach
for
a
hibernation
before
this
one
any
day
rich
mouthfeel
tingly
on
the
tongue
full
in
the
cheeks
slightly
warming
in
the
finish
clear
brown
in
color
with
some
bronze
tints
thin
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
not
much
to
look
at
things
start
looking
up
at
the
first
sniff
roasted
maltyness
nuts
and
some
booze
burn
taste
falls
right
into
line
with
the
smell
the
taste
is
nice
and
solid
but
in
the
end
it
comes
across
somewhat
subdued
nothing
really
stands
out
and
gives
that
wow
sensation
finishes
dry
with
no
aftertaste
overall
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
trying
but
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
with
little
to
no
cabonation
the
coarse
head
was
minimal
and
left
quickly
no
biggy
though
nice
burned
malty
aroma
taste
is
initially
hoppy
piney
and
citrusy
however
it
quickly
reveals
a
healthy
malty
nutty
backbone
nice
and
roasted
nice
mellow
finish
doesnt
linger
too
long
no
real
spice
to
it
seems
more
like
a
mild
american
barleywine
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
will
be
consuming
more
on
these
chilly
nights
we
are
starting
to
have
i
like
this
beer
enjoyed
the
full
glass
but
that
funky
bitterness
at
the
end
becomes
a
touch
overwhelming
definitely
worth
a
try
but
im
not
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
taste
finds
itself
meandering
around
my
tongue
and
mouth
creamy
mellow
base
of
yeast
vanilla
and
spice
split
between
a
slight
hop
citrus
bitterness
i
love
that
avery
can
brew
this
holiday
beer
i
am
slowly
gaining
more
and
more
respect
for
avery
brewery
drinks
really
good
for
the
abv
makes
me
wish
for
some
roast
pork
or
goose
i
do
think
the
dryness
would
get
to
me
before
the
abv
i
really
liked
this
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
but
nothing
really
detracts
from
it
either
it
is
solid
and
enjoyable
pours
a
rich
brownish
red
color
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
smell
is
sweet
with
a
bready
doughy
type
aroma
too
sweet
caramel
malt
as
well
taste
is
dried
fruits
and
some
viney
grape
flavors
a
little
watery
with
some
light
carbonation
drinkable
and
enjoyable
even
when
the
weather
hasnt
yet
turned
cold
avery
pleases
once
again
worth
checking
out
drinkability
perhaps
not
the
most
drinkable
on
a
90
degree
day
but
this
would
improve
come
fall
and
winter
would
not
want
another
on
a
hot
night
should
come
back
to
review
this
winter
to
see
if
this
changes
good
beer
just
not
a
good
hot
summer
night
brew
d
another
good
winter
warmer
i
enjoyed
it
even
though
it
is
80
degrees
out
here
everyday
on
the
coast
one
of
averys
better
brews
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
inch
light
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
fresh
coffee
smell
along
with
some
fruity
notes
taste
again
fresh
brewed
mild
coffee
with
ripe
fruit
in
the
background
some
kind
of
melon
maybe
also
slightly
sweet
tasting
mouthfeel
is
light
very
smooth
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
overall
a
nice
fall
winter
very
drinkable
beer
i
did
feel
that
it
was
perfect
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
was
commenting
that
it
must
be
a
lower
alcohol
thinking
of
an
english
bitter
allowing
you
to
drink
several
in
a
short
amount
of
time
but
was
wrong
i
still
think
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
night
but
you
will
be
feeling
it
drinking
a
fresh
one
in
2011
it
is
not
as
well
behaved
on
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
also
is
a
bit
harsh
needing
mellowing
so
aging
a
few
months
apparently
helps
it
smells
much
better
though
a
4
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thin
creamylooking
head
beer
has
a
sweet
malty
presence
with
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
smells
like
candy
the
taste
is
also
quite
sweet
there
is
an
ambercaramel
maltyness
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
covered
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
finish
drinkability
is
decent
not
a
quaffer
though
cheers
overall
this
is
a
nice
change
from
what
im
used
to
nothing
too
unusual
mind
you
but
nice
malty
beer
there
is
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
to
this
warming
brew
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
tastes
like
an
amber
imp
stout
maybe
to
throw
words
together
nice
i
regret
not
opening
this
one
sooner
i
still
think
i
like
this
best
fresh
but
it
is
not
bad
aged
recommended
deep
dark
brown
with
a
good
thick
creamy
white
head
that
takes
minutes
to
settle
smells
of
toffee
chocolate
piney
hops
tastes
of
sweet
malts
slight
hop
presence
end
with
an
alcohol
bite
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
very
sweet
very
syrupy
good
beer
nice
warmer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
tan
head
that
dies
down
but
swirls
on
the
top
and
leaves
rings
on
the
pint
glass
most
of
the
way
down
smells
wonderfull
but
very
unlike
a
typical
warmer
more
like
a
double
plum
fig
cherry
ride
over
a
chocolatecaramel
malt
with
none
of
the
spiciness
that
i
associate
with
winter
beers
a
delectable
dessert
tastes
much
the
same
but
less
pleasurable
for
whatever
reason
like
some
malty
fruitcake
its
got
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
suprisingly
dry
finish
it
masks
the
8
very
well
just
the
warmth
makes
it
through
not
the
fire
it
is
more
drinkable
than
most
dubbels
actually
but
compared
to
other
warmers
i
think
its
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
unless
youve
got
a
real
craving
look
forward
to
picking
these
up
again
next
year
alcohol
where
is
it
great
job
of
hiding
the
high
abv
and
with
just
a
few
tweaks
this
could
be
great
i
could
drink
a
few
solid
medium
brown
pour
with
yellowbrown
head
head
held
at
about
34
inch
until
dissolving
to
a
thin

wow
is
this
stuff
good
very
rich
amazing
feel
on
the
palate
i
just
got
some
old
school
bubblegum
you
know
the
rock
hard
sticks
of
bubblegum
that
came
in
topps
baseball
card
packs
in
the
late
80s
that
is
the
prevailing
aftertaste
right
now
a
nice
almost
spicy
bitter
cocoa
comes
through
quite
soon
in
the
pint
this
is
a
fantastic
english
strong
ale
d
okay
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
component
by
component
there
isnt
much
to
complain
about
but
the
gestalt
of
the
beer
just
didnt
click
with
me
for
some
reason
i
might
try
it
again
and
find
it
more
enjoyable
at
a
later
date
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
regular
old
12oz
pint
glass
nice
deep
amber
brown
color
with
some
orange
tint
when
held
up
to
the
light
good
looking
thick
and
creamy
head
settles
on
top
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
as
the
beer
recedes
the
aroma
is
a
dull
muted
malt
scent
nothing
special
but
definitely
more
malty
than
hoppy
it
does
mellow
out
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
and
reveals
some
fruitier
tones
the
taste
is
quite
good
rich
malt
flavor
with
notes
of
caramel
plum
and
coffee
possesses
a
nice
hoppy
balance
even
the
hops
are
not
terribly
prominent
very
nice
beer
here
mouthfeel
is
sturdy
but
a
bit
thinner
than
i
might
expect
from
a
warmer
the
high
abv
is
masked
neatly
by
a
slew
of
quality
ingredients
and
excellent
brewing
more
high
marks
for
avery
very
good
and
easy
too
drink
smooth
rich
and
complex
this
is
my
favorite
winter
warmer
selection
this
year
overall
this
is
a
very
big
winter
warmer
big
on
both
taste
and
alcohol
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
felt
the
alcohol
overshadowed
many
of
its
better
aspects
nevertheless
i
would
definitely
prefer
this
to
many
of
the
more
typical
examples
of
the
style
comments
this
would
be
a
nice
one
to
accompany
a
rich
warm
dessrt
like
a
christmas
pudding
brandy
butter
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
i
have
tried
this
season
big
bold
flavors
and
alcohol
do
not
get
in
the
way
of
this
beers
drinkability
d
this
could
be
my
favorite
winter
warmer
perfect
sipping
brew
for
a
cold
snowy
day
a
definite
must
buy
each
winter
season
beef
notes
im
certainly
glad
i
picked
up
this
holiday
offering
ill
be
looking
for
it
next
year
overall
an
excellent
brew
and
was
a
great
way
to
warm
up
after
coming
inside
in
an
ithaca
blizzard
warms
me
right
up
probably
could
be
a
little
less
hoppy
but
thats
just
my
taste
d
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
a
nice
spicyhoppy
beer
on
a
cold
snowy
night
i
gotta
be
honest
this
is
super
malty
and
smooth
i
like
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
giving
it
a
bit
of
a
drying
character
drinkability
is
really
good
especially
if
you
like
lots
of
roasted
malt
flavors
drinkability
a
great
label
on
the
bottle
doesnt
make
for
a
great
beer
but
this
one
did
the
dark
roasted
flavors
can
warm
you
up
on
a
very
cold
day
would
i
drink
this
again
i
sure
would
even
in
the
summer
time
i
could
drink
this
beer
is
this
another
good
avery
beer
yeah
it
is
if
you
like
malty
roasty
winter
warmers
then
this
is
the
beer
you
should
pick
up
drinkability
while
nothing
in
this
beer
stood
out
to
me
as
being
exceptional
ok
the
smell
was
really
good
im
very
drawn
to
this
beer
it
just
has
a
nice
comfortable
feeling
that
well
does
a
good
job
of
warming
you
up
just
like
its
supposed
to
not
at
all
over
the
top
a
quality
beer
the
taste
is
an
understated
sweetness
that
immediately
goes
to
a
spicy
flavor
of
earthy
hops
and
black
pepper
among
others
as
this
rolls
across
your
tounge
you
know
its
a
heavy
beer
but
one
you
will
find
yourself
coming
back
to
again
and
again
pours
a
dark
hazelnut
color
and
red
hues
up
to
the
light
nice
creamy
off

head
and
good
retention
and

the
end

and
some
faint

complimentary
spicy
hop
balance
that
is
bitter
but
not
overpowering
roasted
woody
finish
medium
carbonation
and
a
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
with
just
a
little
fizz
around
the
edges
that
gets
a
little
silkier
as
the
glass
goes
down
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
night
by
the
fire
bottle
poured
a
deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
nice
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
deep
malt
with
some
sweet
dry
fruits
is
really
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
with
some
presence
of
dry
fruits
and
a
hoppy
slightly
bitter
finish
body
is
above
average
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
is
discernable
cheers
drinkability
this
is
very
good
ale
and
only
the
high
abv
suppresses
sessionability
this
is
very
hearty
and
i
wish
it
was
a
year
round
option

just
had
a
twoyear
old
bottle
while
i
wouldnt
let
it
go
any

oxidation

starting
to
creep

was
a
fantastic
beer

overalla
very
good
winter
beer
d
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
that
will
most
likely
satisfy
but
its
high
abv
can
get
to
you
after
a
few
for
my
money
though
i
would
probably
go
with
odell
isolation
over
this
beer
although
they
are
both

a
very

beer
reminded
me
of
anchors
production
has
that
musty
character
the
body
is
good
and
supports
the
complex
malty
flavor
good
carbonation
one
deterrent
is
the
phenolic
flavor
that
leaves
a
harsh
alcoholic
after
taste
although
this
is
not
obnoxious
it
still
is
there
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
very
nice
warming
flavors
on
a
cold
winter
night
medium
body
with
active
carbonation
almost
too
active
for
a
winter
warmer
imo
nice
brew
to
have
around
the
holidays
but
if
it
only
could
match
it
appearance
it
would
outstanding
good
beer
but
not
really
sessionable
in
my
opinion
2
or
3
would
probably
do
the
trick
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
hops
andor
spices
to
liven
it
up
a
little
this
is
a
very
tasty
malty
beer
that
hides
its
8
alcohol
very
well
the
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
bit
thin
but
otherwise
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
getting
more
of
it
next
year
merry
christmas
this
beer
is
awesome
and
quite
nice
as
compared
to
some
of
the
spice
bombs
you
get
in
a
winter
seasonal
i
will
drink
this
again
for
certain
fairly
drinkable
but
there
is
something
curiously
lacking
here
a
mighty
and
tasty
beer
here
that
is
among
the
best
of
the
winter
warmers
the
main
feature
of
this
beer
is
it
is
perfectly
in
balance
with
all
its
parts
a
tasty
beer
that
isnt
overly
sweet
bitter
spiced
or
dumbed
down
to
suit
the
budweiser
fans
one
of
the
better
beers
that
avery
makes
probably
the
best
one
in
fact
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
amazing
dark
murky
brownish
black
with
a
serious
thick
head
that
leaves
some
big
time
lace
on
the
mug
this
is
one
fine
looking
brew
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
seen
smell
is
of
some
dark
roasted
malty
yeasty
smells
with
a
bit
of
some

presents
taste
is
of
a
malty
good
time
i
can
taste
about
4
different
malt
flavors
in
there
like
roasted
chocolate
and
figs
and
nuts
this
taste
as
awesome
as
it
smells
this
is
a
fine
drink
to
behold
and
one
that
goes
well

that

this
is
a
fine
brew
but
it
leaves
me
somewhat
puzzled
and
unmoved
im
really
going
out
of
my
way
this
year
to
try
as
many
winter
seasonals
as
i
can
and
i
must
say
i
still
am
having
trouble
getting
my
head
around
what
winter
warmer
means
stylistically
speaking
that
said
i
will
revisit
this
beer
to
see
if
it
grows
on
me
anymore
a
very
likable
beer
and
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
impressive
interesting
very
interesting
d
this
beer
has
a
slight
sweetness
from
the
malt
that
blends
into
a
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
dont
really
work
with
each
other
d
well
if
that
dirty
flavor
hadnt
popped
up
i
think
i
would
have
rated
this
beer
much
higher
it
is
what
it
is
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
sessionable
due
to
the
alcohol
content
it
is
however
a
pretty
good
sipper
reminds
me
of
a
minbarleywine
in
some
respects
but
rather
mild
in
flavor
an
interesting
winter
warmer
to
try
but
one
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
d
pretty
damn
good
the
extrra
full
body
and
the
sweetness
may
hinder
sessionability
but
thats
not
the
point
with
this
beer
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
this
wonderful
winter
warmer

the
prescence

there
was

the
taste
is
so
beautifully
balanced

elegant

this

the

are
very
hoppy

malts
all
at
the

time
this
is
what
a
strongold
ale
is
supposed
to
smell
like
wonderful
the
taste
is
malty
and
strong
but
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
in
this
brew
and
the
hops
that
hit
hard
on
the
finish
round
things
out
nicely
the

it

aroma
this
beer
has
a
nice
hop
contribution
for
some
reason
i
was
not
expecting
this
but
it
is
good
the
taste
has
some
fruity
cherry
notes
as
well
as
some
light
subtle
spice
character
as
i
understand
it
this
is
all
done
without
the
use
of
any
real
spices
the
finish
is
slightly
astringent
and
is
accompanied
by
a
light
sweetness
there
is
a
bitter
hop
finish
as
well

not

it
is

giving

a
nice
balance
worth
trying
out
if
you
see
it
drinkability
not
what
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
fairly
undrinkable
for
my
tastes
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
and
may
have
built
it
up
to
much
the
stickiness

as
it
warms

brew
a
deep
mahogany
brew
rests
in
my

topped
with
a
creamy
sticky
head

the
nose
suggests
christmastime
spices
but
the
website
suggests
that
they
used
no
spices
whatsoever
in
the
brewing
of
this
ale
apart
from
of
course
our
friends
the
hops
a
woody
and
nutty
aroma
with

crispness
is
present
moreso
than
the
aforementioned
however
its
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
as
well

also
deep
and
malty
in
a
warming
way
a
wellplaced
hop
bite
at

at

fine
beer
perfect
for
a
winter
night
with
a
book
or
other
form
of
quiet
enjoyment
overall
impression
very
tasty
big
brew
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
tames
a
generous
dose
of
hops
the
spice
taste
is
so
mild
that
its
hard
to
call
a
christmas
beer
but
who
cares
its
good
ill
be
grabbing
a
few
more
for
the
cellar
if
you
see
some
give
it
a
try
pours
out
to
a
a
dark
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
very
slight
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
fruity
with
some
fresh
malt
thrown
in
the
taste
is
good
with
a
nice
malty
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
giving
way
to
a
light
yet
tasty
hop
dose
on
the
finish
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
masks
the
8
abv
very
well
this
breweries
offerings
have
been
readily
available
in
my
area
detroit
for
awhile
ill
be
exploring
their
other
beers
soon
a
very
wellrounded
winter
ale
dark
garnet
red
color
and
spicy
aroma
big
malt
with
faint
pear
essence
and
carbernet
wine
hops
are
well
balanced
against
the
malt
giving
a
beefy
finish
to
the
beer
the
high
abv
is
woven
into
the
flavor
and
not
at
all
prominent
overall
a
very
traditional
sort
of
strong
ale
and
a
very
nice
seasonal
offering
on
to
the
good
stuff
the
taste
wonderful
bold
and
quite
complex
very
balanced
between
hop
malt
and
yeasts
this
is
one
smooth
brew
did
i
say
great
color
well
its
richly
dark
and
mysterious
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
stuff
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
definitely
try
again
on
the
pour
a
transparent
bruin
with
a
majestic
crown
of
creamy
head
that
is
a
beauteous
beige
color
and
the
lace
an
all
encompassing
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
the
hop
floral
aroma
greets
you
first
followed
by
the
fresh
and
slightly
earthy
malt
sweetness
also
a
fine
brandy
like
top
also
present
in
this
magnificent
nose
start
is
ambrosial
rich
in
malt
with
the
top
middling
to
full
in
its
feel
finish
is
moderate
in
acidity
the
hops
forceful
in
their
spicy
presence
bittersweet
aftertaste
ends
this
great
work
of
the
brewers
art
with
each
new
beer
i
sample
from
this
brewery
my
admiration
grows
by
leaps
and
bounds
i
like
this
one
at
first
it
was
alittle
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
but
then
the
hoppiness
calmed
down
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
a
nice
frothy
creamy
head
the
head
lasted
a
little
bit
and
then
went
down
to
a
thick
laceing
the
smell
was
quite
malty
mixed
with
a
beefy
and
fruity
body
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
but
more
on
the
semifruity
side
mouthfeel
was
creamybubbly
and
balanced
out
pretty
well
all
in
all
a
good
offering
from
avery
the
first
brew
from
them
that
i
have
had
and
most
likely
not
the
last
overall
fantastic
very
reminiscent
of
some
english
strong
ales
that
i
drank
in
the
uk
i
must
return
to
the
beer
store
where
i
found
this
offering
standing
on
its
own
and
pick
up
a
whole
6pack
if
i
can
avery
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
this
is
one
heck
of
a
solid
holiday
beer
as
i
am
getting
tired
of
holiday
ales
with
cinnamon
and
spice
this
is
an
old
school
old
ale
nice
strong
maltiness
toffeeish
caramel
tones
i
love
it
a
nice
warming
brew
for
cold
winter
months
id
recommend
this
to
anybody
alright
for
a
winter
seasonal
lack
of
spices
in
the
brewing
process
is
alright
not
all
winter
seasonals
have
to
be
brewed
with
spices
which
in
this
case
makes
the
beer
rather
mellow
could
be
because
of
an
older
sample
or
maybe
thats
just
the
nature
of
this
brew
definitely
stands
out
from

a

dark
amber
color

that
fades
into
a
nice
amount
of

the
nose
is
quite
lovely

is
the
highlight
of
the
beer
with

a

with
notes

followed
by
some
unsweetened

a
roasted
nuttiness
has
a
brief
showing
before
some
drying
alcohol
finishes
the
taste
overall
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
makes
for
a
fine
drink
on
a
cold
evening
im
guessing
this
one
is
from
last
christmas
season
and
at
8
abv
and
bottle
conditioning
if
handled
properly
by
the
good
folks
at

have

is
this
the

whod
have

it
comes
from

i
could
see
a

enjoying
this

tell

not
to
get
the

with
this
one
so
drinkable
despite
its

very
good

crystal
clear
mahogany

despite
a

aroma
is
rich
with
plentiful
citrusy
hops
bullion
warm
bready
sweet
malts
a
hint
of
caramel
and
faint
nuts
there
is
a
distinct
lime
character
to
the

and
makes
for
an
interesting
aroma
mouthfeel
is
moderately
smooth
and
soft
in
finish
with
a
mediumfirm

taste
starts
with
brisk
floral
hops
fades
into
a
firm
yet
not
overly
sweet
earthy
malt
backbone
and
is
followed
by
a
soft
toasty
graininess
raisins
dates
and
figs
are
minimal
without
any
noteable
vinous
qualities
the
finish
is
extremely
smooth
in

however
there
is
a
harsh
flavor
hop
towards
the
end
with
some
astringent
roasted
grains
the
malts
are
beefy
and
linger
while
coating
the

is
hardly
noticeable
in
taste
but
creates
a
pleasant
warming
effect
despite
others
comments
that
they
taste
spices
averys
webpage
states
that
this
brew
is
not
flavored
with
spices
and
i
dont
taste
them
this
is
a
complex
and
rewarding
brew
and
certainly
would
benefit
from
cellaring
the
hops
are
a
little
rough
at
this
point
if
it
were
a
musical
scale
it
would
be
dorian
old
jubilation
has
a
mediumfull
body
about
as
expected
from
an
8
offering
with
a
nice
tight
nonprickly
carbonation
falling
somewhere
between
soft
and
crisp
the
flavor
is
malt
driven
but
not
crystal
maltsi
taste
mostly
dry
chocolate
malts
in
fact
its
the
dryish
aspect
of
the
darker
malts
that
give
this
beer
a
good
chunk
of
its
earthy
dry
pipetobaccolike
character
the
finish
is
the
samelingering
dry
roasted
maltiness
with
a
solid
bitterness
that
doesnt
taste
particularly
hoppy
i
understand
that
this
beer
is
singlehopped
with
bullions
but
i
wouldnt
know
what
a
bullion
tasted
like
after
having
this
beer
alone
as
the
hops
seem
to
mainly
impart
maltbalancing
bitterness
in
the
case
of
old
jubilation
the
sweetness
is
very
appetizing
even
as
its
juxtaposed
against
the
dryness
of
the
highkilned
malts
and
the
hops
leaving
a
beautiful
combination
of
brown
sugar
and
roasted
sweetened
nuts
in
my
mouth
what
a
beautifully
balanced
complex
ale
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
one

old

is
a
delicious
brew
the
only
noteable
weak
link
in
the
chain
is
the
weak
mouthfeel
perhaps
a
result
of
excessive
filtration
it
is
nonetheless
an
absolutely

any

appears
in

i
also
recoginize
a

to
this

i
upped
the
drinkability
since
i
no
longer
notice
the

thank
you
to
davo
for
my
second
sampling
of
this
brew
dark
ruby
color
with
nutty
malt
nose
very
malty
upfront
almost
cloying
with
too
much
hop
flavor
hops
actually
detract
from
the
malt
flavor
a
very
nice
seasonal
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
rusted
and
infected
smelt
of
coins
and
tasted
much
the
same
had
this
right
after
having
christmas
prairie
bomb
found
this
to
be
much
superior
than
cpb
doesnt
really
have
typical
holiday
spices
to
me
but
that
is
not
a
criticism
a
nice
brew
bought
it
at
a
reduced
price
after
the
2013
holiday
and
had
aged
in
my
cellar
for
a
year
delicious
with
over
a
year
on
it
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
think
its
slightly
underrated
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
am
really
glad
i
tried
it
thanks
prairie
a
bit
sour
a
bit
savory
a
bit
delicious
not
exciting
but
worth
checking
out
this
beer
has
all
kinds
of
potential
i
think
the
old
ale
notes
are
quite
good
when
they
shine
through
and
i
really
like
the
amount
of
oak
and
barrel
flavor
the
mouthfeel
really
hurts
it
for
me
and
the
bacteria
also
take
away
from
the
good
aspects
of
the
beer
after
a
few
sips
i
would
like
to
try
a
nonsoured
version
of
this
just
lacks
a
total
melding
of
the
flavors
presented
o
it
has
potential
but
its
pretty
much
a
mess
old
ale
flavors
are
just
decent
the
brett
is
kinda
boring
for
brett
and
theres
too
much
of
it
definitely
too
foamy
not
bad
i
assume
something
went
haywire
with
the
brett
andor
oak
barrel
unpleasant
sourness
that
doesnt
work
well
serving
type
bottle
overall
not
a
huge
fan
it
could
have
been
a
whole
lot
better
it
almost
tastes
as
though
something
got
into
the
brew
either
in
the
bottle
or
the
barrel
more
than
likely
form
the
spices
added
the
sour
oakyness
does
fade
a
bit
as
it
warms
decent
beer
not
sure
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
sour
or
not
but
very
enjoyable
this
started
out
as
an
odd
beer
but
as
it
warmed
up
i
really
enjoyed
it
worth
a
try
some
good
bones
with
the
making
of
an
infection
tart
cherry
flavor
is
distracting
the
tart
fruits
and
chocolate
and
leather
i
get
dont
blend
as
cohesively
well
as
i
would
like
im
glad
im
splitting
this
one
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
nose
and
taste
seem
to
be
on
conflict
but
it
works
beautifully
definitely
worth
a
try
definitely
recommended
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
i
would
have
again
tangentially
there
was
a
touch
of
cap
rust
but
nothing
bad
would
maybe
have
again
worth
finding
if
you
are
a
big
beer
fanatic
o
at
first
i
was
calling
this
a
stout
and
remembered
that
it
was
an
old
ale
cool
idea
and
one
i
really
enjoyed
o
all
in
all
a
very
complex
quality
beer
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
20
dollars
i
paid
for
it
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
very
unique
overall
man
this
is
great
its
an
old
ale
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
inoculated
with
wild
bacteria
im
nearly
speechless
it
certainly
isnt
traditional
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
i
love
what
they
have
done
with
it
4
255
the
beer
smells
great
but
the
flavors
dont
meld
like
the
aroma
the
tartness
has
a
middle
ground
so
it
seems
to
be
in
the
way
ill
crack
another
bottle
in
a
few
years
to
see
if
this
goes
further
on
the
sour
train
a
strange
beer
but
not
a
bad
one
i
enjoyed
the
interplay
between
the
acids
and
the
sugars
something
you
dont
normally
find
in
darker
styles
like
this
sure
there
are
some
kinks
to
work
out
i
mean
sometimes
it
comes
together
and
the
blend
tastes
plastic
but
it
ended
up
pretty
tasty
o
im
not
really
feeling
this
prairie
ale
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
brewery
but
this
one
seems
like
a
mess
it
gave
some
off
flavors
while
it
was
complex
the
flavors
didnt
play
well
together
good
but
not
great
i
pretty
awesome
imo
tart
dark
cherry
abd
effervescent
are
what
will
stick
with
me
92
i
suppose
this
is
what
youd
call
a
winter
saison
in
principal
but
its
a
little
too
blown
out
of
proportion
to
be
fully
elegant
in
execution
not
the
worst
ive
had
of
its
kind
but
memorable
for
more
bad
reasons
than
great
the
wild
yeast
is
really
giving
the
beer
a
beating
at
this
point
and
many
of
the
oak
and
maltspice
nuances
that
would
make
this
refreshing
are
going
to
become
more
overrun
i
dont
know
if
this
varies
from
bottle
to
bottle
but
its
definitely
something
im
going
to
look
out
for
every
time
this
passes

pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
toffee
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
malt
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
the
slight
tartness
is
unexpected
an
interesting
variation
on
an
old
ale
there
are
nice
underlain
traditional
dark
fruit
notes
and
sweet
bready
notes
but
with
a
woody
funk
and
mild
tart
acidity
that
makes
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable

really

take
on
the

here
o
mild
flavors

boozy

try
to
show
not
that
great
taste
bittersweet
choc
caramel
dates
prunes

a
dark

with

that

smells
of
chocolate

malt
those
all
carry
over
to
the
taste
also
notes
of
cherry
and

oily

lots

the
style
isnt

notes
i
liked
the
sounds
of
the
beer
particularly
with
prairies
track
record
this
fell
flat
for
me
though
nice
looking
and
smelling
but
the
taste
a
little
bland
the
dark
cherry
notes
with
the
brett
was
nice
but
it
was
too
subtle
to
carry
the
show
and
nothing
else
stood
out
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
neat
label
at
1011
for
500
ml
of
barrel
aged
10
oldwild
ale
its
not
a
bad
price
if
youre
curious
but
i
doubt
ill
repurchase
o
not
a
bad
combination
of
flavors
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
definitely
unique
and
gets
points
on
creativity
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
but
tightly
knit
cream
colored
head
i
get
some
serious
bourboncarmelized
sugarand
dark
malt
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
molassesbrettplums
and
bourbon
and
it
somehow
works
together
the
blend
of
molasses
and
bourbon
are
sweetbut
the
tartness
of
the
brett
quickly
follows
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
dry
not
bad
but
certainly
came
up
short
of
expectations
im
sure
this
will
age
well
but
very
rough
on
the
edges
now
maybe
my
least
favorite
beer
from
these
guys
if
i
buy
any
more
it
will
be
to
age
o
overall
a
decent
old
ale
though
i
was
hoping
for
more
having
heard
great
things
about
their
other
beers
nose
is
nice
but
the
taste
is
light
and
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
and
burnt
malts
decent
but
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
stuff
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
beer
seems
to
be
a
hot
mess
of
flavors
sordove
running
together
high
b
cheers
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
that
shows
great
retention
aromas
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
a
hint
of
oak
and
higher
spirits
a
bit
of
papery
oxidation
and
a
light
lactic
cherry
fruitiness
light
chocolate
comes
out
especially
as
she
warms
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
dark
sugary
up
front
alcohol
tart
cherries
tobacco
and
chocolate
fly
in
midway
through
finishes
with
a
lingering
caramel
and
fruity
tartness
medium
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sugary
but
somewhat
tart
mouthfeel
decent
brew
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
great
wild
ale
that
sadly
appears
to
be
misunderstood
here
o
disappointing
light
in
taste
which
some
could
say
its
nice
and
subtle
and
light
in
body
and
mouthfeel
i
wish
i
could
like
it
as
old
ales
are
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
probably
the
least
favorite
ive
tried
in
that
style
though
very
cool
packaging
on
this
white
wax
funky
red
label
very
cool
very
holiday
not
cheap
but
a
darn
good
beer
inside
too
barrel
aged
old
ale
cool
stuff
light
brown
color
thick
and
hazy
with
a
red
tint
looks
like
a
big
english
barleywine
without
a
ton
of
head
nose
of
sweet
bourbon
rich
caramel
malt
oak
and
brown
sugar
its
sweet
for
sure
in
taste
but
about
midway
through
comes
a
flash
of
tart
fruit
maybe
cranberry
or
raspberry
before
the
bourbon
woody
dusty
old
ale
finish
we
all
know
and
love
its
a
short
burst
but
a
memorable
one
it
confuses
the
mouthfeel
between
sweet
and
tart
and
between
heavy
and
light
and
this
is
a
rather
tough
beer
to
classify
as
a
result
it
also
has
a
slightly
wild
yeast
element
indicative
of
other
prairie
beers
and
it
sort
of
shakes
up
the
old
ale
conventions
but
not
so
much
as
to
render
it
out
of
style
sweeter
in
the
finish
too
with
brown
sugar
and
a
little
holiday
spice
hanging
around
after
the
swallow
a
good
beer
but
a
little
to
much
going
on
to
be
fully
cohesive
even
in
light
of
the
bourbon
barrel
which
is
usually
unifying
prairie
is
starting
to
price
their
beers
out
of
reach
for
me
to
have
them
regularly
i
took
a
chance
on
this
and
dont
regret
it
but
not
something
i
will
revisit
at
this
price
oddly
put
together
missing
a
backbone
it
seems
as
though
tbtsc
is
a
bit
of
wanderer
it
doesnt
have
a
definitive
beer
base
its
good
but
not
memorable
it
may
end
up
not
being
what
you
sought
out
for
but
its
kinda
like
christmas
in
a
bottle
in
an
odd
way
the
feel
is
creamy
not
entirely
thick
but
very
smooth
pours
dark
brown
shaded
with
magenta
opaque
probably
cloudy
but
its
too
dark
to
really
tell
small
light
beige
head
decent
lacing
retention
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
stewed
berries
cocoa
brown
sugar
and
apricots
in
the
nose
i
think
theres
some
barrel
presence
but
its
kinda
hard
to
tell
whats
what
possibly
some
spirit
and
oak
knocking
around
it
smells
like
sugar
cookies
fruitcake
and
rum
thats
more
a
function
of
the
alcohol
and
fruitiness
rather
than
any
sort
of
guess
at
the
barrels
used
the
taste
also
has
lots
of
fruit
and
heavy
sweetness
a
tad
medicinal
some
definite
booze
light
chocolate
berries
and
apricots
soaked
in
caramel
wine
and
booze
thick
feel
never
gets
too
sticky
though
interesting
stuff
definitely
more
legitimately
old
aleish
than
i
expected
which
is
fun
its
not
a
barleywine
and
theres
a
whole
bunch
of
stuff
going
on
good
for
a
cold
winter
night
but
this
beer
might
catch
some
offguard
taste
is
a
slight
bitter
stoutness
with
a
little
tart
on
top
of
that
i
get
the
tart
cherries
that
others
were
referring
to
a
bit
thin
which
gives
it
a
twangy
almost
metallic
taste
but
for
10
its
pretty
good
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
if
i
had
brewed
this
id
be
proud
but
in
the
world
of
beer
distribution
its
a
little
better
than
decent
artwork
on
the
label
is
choice
also
o
incredibly
dry
finish
interesting
flavor
profile
but
not
necessarily
may
favorite
holiday
brew
t
dark
malt
and
fruit
flavors
upfront
with
a
surprising
sour
edge
raisin
mild
toffee
red
grape
skin
rum
barrel
sour
plum
and
some
tingling
alcohol
on
the
finish
not
that
this
says
much
but
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
their
beers
so
far
still
digging
it
though
and
id
love
to
see
what
this
is
like
in
a
few
years
feels
like
it
needs
to
round
out
a
bit
its
not
ready
to
save
christmas
just
yet
o
9095100
this
is
a
great
beer
i
wish
it
was
an
annual
brew
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
but
its
definitely
not
an
old
ale
unless
it
was
infected
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
i
get
some
mild
barrelold
ale
flavors
there
are
hints
of
vanilla
but
its
mostly
a
red
grapevinous
tart
flavor
not
overpowering
and
actually
kind
of
pleasant
but
im
a
fan
of
pretty
much
everything
sourfunky
im
really
interested
in
the
back
story
for
this
beer
overall
pretty
good
id
give
it
a
solid
b
weird
beer
for
sure
though
pours
a
dark
amber
with
flashes
of
orange
around
the
edges
small
off
white
head
dissipates
to
leave
behind
thick
lacing
smell
is
vinous
brett
bourbon
and
whiskey
cola
taste
is
woody
bourbon
some
wine
character
dry
cola
cold
coffee
mouthfeel
is
off
dry
and
slick
overall
not
bad
but
not
the
best
could
use
some
age
to
mellow
out
the
bitter
and
bring
up
some
of
the
fruitier
brett
character
this
beer
also
had
significant
condensation
under
the
capwax
as
report
in
the
forumnot
really
an
issue
but
could
be
down
the
road
this
is
an
english
olde
ale
style
apparently
it
probably
needs
a
couple
years
in
the
bottle
that
said
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
the
price
was
not
great
but
i
think
the
investment
in
saving
a
couple
bottles
might
be
light
head
and
body
roasty
but
almost
like
there
was
some
lager
yeast
involved
the
thing
that
stuck
out
for
me
was
just
like
the
wine
barrel
noir
its
like
chocolate
covered
cranberries
its
not
exactly
sour
its
not
exactly
dessert
chocolatey
its
kind
of
an
uncomfortable
medium
i
think
a
couple
years
in
the
bottle
might
do
this
well
but
i
also
thought
the
midnineties
cleveland
indians
would
be
unstoppable
i
guess
well
see
until
then
we
can
only
get
in
line
for
a
two
bottle
per
person
limit
to
pay
for
wax
and
amber
glass
i
hope
the
best
for
this
beer
overall
meh
pretty
bland
and
one
trick
pony
esp
for
so
much
bourbon
o
overall
this
was
a
relatively
disappointing
beer
rather
one
note
starts
off
with
a
dark
brown
pour
with
a
creamy
toffee
head
the
smell
is
enticing
right
off
the
bat
with
hints
of
spice
oak
and
leather
a
great
combination
the
initial
taste
was
a
touch
sour
for
my
palate
but
as
i
continue
to
push
through
i
found
it
to
be
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
for
a
dark
ale
with
a
continuation
all
the
way
through
to
the
end
ten
minutes
after
a
sip
you
can
still
get
the
tartness
and
the
hints
of
oakvanilla
throughout
halfway
through
my
first
bottle
i
realized
that
yes
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
obtain
for
my
cellar
ok
so
to
recap
the
beer
made
your
mothers
voice
reconcilable
it
did
just
the
trick
with
that
wide
range
of
foods
but
dealing
with
all
those
kids
it
just
might
make
you
want
to
join
right
in
i
wonder
if
this
beer
would
be
better
if
cellared
or
aged
for
a
few
more
months
10
is
a
doozy
but
pretty
standard
by
prairie
strong
malty
aroma
has
a
firm
overtone
of
cocoa
almost
smells
more
like
hot
cocoa
than
like
beer
hey
i
love
chocolate
pours
a
clear
sepia
with
a
nice
fluffy
and
finebubbled
wheat
head
malty
flavor
has
a
strong
cocoa
overtone
which
i
found
rather
enjoyable
i
detected
hints
of
apple
and
caramel
as
well
texture
has
firm
body
and
good
fizz
leaving
a
malty
and
chocolaty
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
fall
when
the
leaves
are
turning
and
its
time
to
break
out
the
down
comforter
incredible
i
loved
this
beer
somewhat
disappointing
entry
that
i
was
hoping
would
be
a
nice
dessertlike
beer
i
think
a
chocolate
version
of
the
old
tom
would
be
a
nice
beer
but
they
need
to
beef
these
up
with
more
malt
more
body
and
more
flavor

o
good
drinkability
nice
british
ale
a
variation
on
the
classic
old
tom
i
like
this
chocolate
version
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
its
lower
alcohol
lends
to
easy
drinking
i
could
have
many
of
these
without
losing
my
cool
which
counts
for
a
lot
with
a
winter
beer
like
this
one
second
its
not
the
least
bit
sweet
and
is
in
fact
shockingly
dry
which
also
lends
to
greater
drinkability
and
is
a
marked
departure
from
the
other
chocolate
ales
out
there
as
an
old
ale
its
less
than
remarkable
though
not
as
malt
driven
or
full
bodied
as
it
could
be
but
with
the
chocolate
it
just
works
good
toast
to
it
all
bakers
chocolate
meets
milk
chocolate
without
the
sugar
and
the
carbonation
is
light
but
the
beer
froths
up
nicely
on
the
palate
a
well
refined
brew
steeped
in
tradition
yet
modernized
in
a
very
appropriate
way
something
quite
unique
fairly
priced
and
outstanding
in
winter
weather
overall
im
not
completely
sold
on
this
beer
its
quirky
flavor
might
have
worked
but
the
uber
thin
body
undercuts
any
potential
theres
a
bottling
code
of
l1312
which
i
assume
is
a
date
of
december
13
based
on
web
gathered
info
from
the
net
this
is
a
best
before
date
and
old
tom
has
an
18month
freshness
window
if
my
assumptions
are
correct
this
beer
could
be
nearly
2
years
old
this
might
account
for
the
weak
and
lifeless
mouthfeel
if
so
my
main
hesitation
toward
buying
imports
is
yet
again
reaffirmed
overall
a
disappointment
tastes
mildly
like
chocolate
and
has
no
alcohol
taste
to
it
might
not
actually
technically
be
beer
o
3

meh
its
not
that
great
pretty
smooth
but
not
much
else
dark
brown
color
is
topped
with
a
small
offwhite
head
initially
the
aroma
is
nothing
but
a
strong
alcohol
smell
disappointed
but
after
letting
it
breath
for
some
moments
you
get
an
amazing
dominant
chocolate
aroma
similar
to
chocoltae
liqueur
taste
is
sweet
chocolatey
and
pleasanty
roasted
finish
is
slightly
hoppy
but
otherwise
neutral
after
some
time
the
bitter
aftertaste
kicks
in
and
rounds
this
beer
o
over
all
really
good
beer
would
defiantly
drink
again
a
well
balanced
tasty
ale
that
is
perfect
with
or
as
a
dessert
and
great
to
have
anytime
of
the
day
a
pretty
good
brew
easy
drinking
and
tasty
nice
change
to
american
hoppy
beers
theres
the
minerals
coming
on
strong
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
same
cocoadusted
vanilla
yogurt
i
was
getting
in
the
nose
cola
even
interesting
but
it
is
not
really
chocolaty
or
much
of
an
old
ale
it
is
however
a
tasty
beverage
mouthfeel
is
less
than
medium
especially
for
the
style
and
lacks
any
sort
of
sweetness
which
is
kinda
expected
for
a
chocolate
ale
or
old
ale
i
like
it
well
enough
but
i
am
not
feeling
compelled
to
go
out

buy

it
doesnt
seem
to
work

slightly
woody
ale
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
o
a
full
on
ale
that
is
quite
moorish
beware
quaffing
it
though
as
it
will
have
you
on
your
back
a
good
ale
here
going
from
old
to
chocolate
cause
why
the
hell
not
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
garnetbrown
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
dusky
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
molasses
light
clove
light
cinnamon
light
roasted
malts
light
oak
and
a
touch
of
black
tea
things
are
a
bit
more
ephemeral
than
the
old
tom
though
thankfully
still
quite
pleasant
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
emphasis
decidedly
on
the
cocoa
which
now
takes
on
a
powdery
character
theres
also
a
slightly
deeper
roast
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
way
in
the
background
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
beer
one
that
shows
you
can
go
crazy
with
chocolate
without
overdoing
it
or
completely
overshadowing
every
other
flavor
the
6
alcohol
content
was
completely
hidden
very
interesting
beer
and
amazingly
drinkable
once
flavours
matched
perfectly
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
the
chocolate
character
is
quite
distinct
it
smells
almost
like
a
bar
of
milk
chocolate
its
an
odd
brew
the
chocolate
and
strong
ale
flavours
dont
entirely
blend
or
complement
each
other
yet
it
seems
to
work
nonetheless
its
different
from
every
other
chocolate
beer
ive
tried
the
usual
pairing
is
dark
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
which
results
in
a
deep
bitterness
that
is
absent
here
its
not
as
good
as
the
original
old
tom
but
goes
down
nicely
to
summarise
unusual
but
tasty
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
82
o
interesting
beer
hitting
all
the
right
notes
not
one
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
hard
to
find
any
flaws
if
you
are
looking
for
a
chocolate
bomb
this
one
isnt
for
you
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
a
chocolate
beer
can
be
a
hit
or
miss
but
i
think
that
the
folks
working
on
chocolate
tom
have
done
a
commmendable
job
with
this
beer
its
got
chocolate
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
all
you
chocoholics
should
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
pours

finger

that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring

a
330ml
bottle
from
julios

westborough
ma
over
all
its
an
average
english
ale
wish
theyd
have
done
a
better
job
with
the
chocolate
overall
this
was
a
nice
subtle
simple
yet
tasty
offering
from
a
brewery
across
the
pond
that
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
chocolate
flavors
are
nice
and
subtle
and
balance
the
base
beer
quite
well
i
wish
for
my
money
that
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
more
of
a
strong
mild
ale
or
an
english
brown
by
american
standards
than
an
old
ale
but
definitely
something
i
enjoyed
because
of
the
elevated
tag
though
i
probably
wont
revisit
anytime
soon
because
fullers
makes
tastier
examples
with
their
1785
and
vintage
ale
body
feels
watery
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
addition
of
chocolate
and
relatively
low
alcohol
content
might
make
this
style
a
little
more
palatable
to
novice
craft
beer
drinkers
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
as
an
after
dinner
drink
or
pairing
it
with
a
dessert
poured
into
a
black
raven

and

finish
is
dry
bittersweet
chocolate
a
bit
abrupt
but
leaves
a
lingering
cocoa
memory
the
flavor
combination
is
well
done
id
like
a
bit
more
malt
in
an
old
ale
but
this
was
satisfying
and
interesting
i
will
definitely
revisit
this

rather

the
taste
is
plain
and
i

close
to
dark

low

and
slightly
bitter

all
in

its
an
example
of

good
beer
in
the
style

better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
though
but
thats
not
saying

finished
with

and
overall
i
enjoyed

am
annoyed
i
only
bought
the
one
of
but
i
will
be
going
back
to
my
favcourite
bottlo
and
buying
more
thats
for
sure
a
nice
balance
between
chocolate
and
beer
for
me
cheers
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
me
the
chocolate
tastes
like
cheap
chocolate
bars
were
added
after
brewing
different
and
well
made
good
carbonisation
and
throughly
enjoyable
really
for
a
winters
night
but
equally
as
good
as
a
summer
nightcap
i
like
it
chilled
in
the
sun
smooth
and
rich
and
still
drinkable
at
6
this
feels
lively
with
much
active
carbonation
as
well
as
slight
oiliness
and
a
warm
finish
drinkability
i
am
a
massive
fan
of
robinsons
old
tom
but
for
me
this
just
doesnt
work
as
well
as
the
original
the
flavour
are
a
bit
too
sweet
and
sickly
and
this
really
hinders
the
drinkability
a
good
idea
but
for
me
the
original
is
still
the
best
darkbrownredish
colour
heavy
chocolate
smell
and
also
some
sweetness
the
choclate
taste
is
profund
and
a
lot
more
than
usually
in
choclate
beers
probably
due
to
the
use
of
real
chocolate
in
the
brew
i
also
felt
a
slight
touch
of
marsipan
its
probably
great
with
sweet

rich

came
across

i
did

thanks
rob
harmless
enough
but
the
chocolate
didnt
really
work
for
me
as
well
as
i
know
it
can
still
a
pleasant
drink
though
overall
a
nice
beer
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
ginger
tom
quite
a
bit
more
cheers
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
and
much
better
than
i
expected
worth
a
try
saw
this
one
on
the
shelf
at
a
local
beer
store
in
northern
italy
the
beer
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
wispy
and
fairly
thin
whats
really
remarkable
about
the
beer
is
its
aroma
its
an
intense
mix
of
both
vanilla
and
chocolate
at
times
one
or
the
other
seem
to
dominate
but
they
are
the
cornerstone
scents
of
this
beer
the
chocolate
is
reminiscent
of
sweet
fine
chocolate
powder
think
an
upmarket
version
of
nestle
quick
following
the
primary
scents
there
is
a
little
toasted
malt
character
and
very
little
almost
no
hop
smells
the
flavor
is
interesting
the
same
qualities
that
are
present
in
the
smell
but
significantly
muted
the
beer
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
the
aroma
telegraphed
lots
of
malt
flavor
which
pair
nicely
with
the
chocolate
the
beer
dries
out
by
the
finish
which
does
have
a
firm
bitterness
for
balance
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
id
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
but
it
is
worth
a
try

the

the
beer
is
not

the

made

fear
there
are
some
moderate
hops
in

this
is
a

beer

would
normally
prefer
the

worthy
o
cant
wait
to
try
other
iterations
on
this
excellent

beer
aged
in
seemingly
perfect
barrels
for
it
to
take
on
additional
flavor
and
complexity
cant
believe
its
taken
so
long
to
suck
it
up
and
pay
the

for
what
is
clearly
a

worth

being
an

drinkable
beyond

and
very

this
brew
is
recommended
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
and
my
heart
sank
with
the
thought
of
an
expensive

when
i
popped
its
top
but
im
rather
pleased
with
this
my
only
wish
is
that
i
had
saved
it
to
be
a
dessert
following
a
rich
meal
a
fine
dark
ale
that
delivers
depth
and
complexity
with
bold
malt
sweetness
tempered
with
scotch
whisky
undertones
seems
similar
to
a
russian
imperial
stout
in
many
ways
intriguing
and
rewarding
and
should
satisfy
any
lover
of
big
dark
ales
i
really
enjoy
the
salty
briny
oceanlike
characteristics
of
this
beer
its
a
good
one
id
certainly
have
again
although
for
the
price
i
feel
i
could
get
bombers
of
bourbonbarrel
aged

at
a
better
value
just
a
thought
o
very
tasty

ridiculously

a

offering
bottled
february
2012
so
its
a
13
month
old
batch
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
probably
not
a
style
im
crazy
about
but
the
quality
is
there
bottled
april
2013
i
didnt
have
the
patience
well
ive
never
had
it
so
im
not
investing
aging
space
on
it
taste
untasted
whatever
the
flavor
version
of
sight
unseen
is
looks
like
used
motor
oil
very
little
carbonation
pitch
black
syrupy
and
with
the
barest
hint
of
a
fleeting
dark
caramel
froth
it
smells
of
old
places
fruitcake
wood
hay
it
just
makes
me
picture
an
ancient
house
in
the
english
countryside
somewhere
the
taste
is
fantastic
it
is
very
subtle
given
the
way
the
beer
looks
and
pours
it
is
light
and
dark
if
that
makes
sense
dark
chocolate
carob
wood
it
manages
to
balance
all
of
these
really
really
well
it
masks
the
alcohol
well
and
just
is
really
surprisingly
easily
drinkable
for
a
black
viscous
brew
mouthfeel
could
use
carbonation
probably
not
stylistically
but
it
would
break
things
up
and
add
a
little
levity
to
this
serious
beer
overall
really
really
nice
not
as
challenging
as
some
old
ales
can
be
with
a
lot
going
on
and
it
manages
to
remain
very
approachable
its
like
that
physics
professor
you
had
in
college
who
was
so
smart
it
drained
your
calculator
battery
when
he
entered
the
room
but
he
managed
to
be
so
entertaining
that
you
never
forgot
him
you
know
the
one
o
another
nice
version
in
the
venerable
ola
dubh
lineup
not
as
mild
as
the
12
year
but
not
as
strong
as
the
18
which
had
quite
a
bit
more
whiskey
character
really
a
good
middle
ground
having
said
that
tasty
and
drinkable
not
as
much
chocolate
as
the
other
versions
oddly
enough
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
regardless
nice
balance
and
it
goes
down
super
easily
o
great
flavors
and
aromas
with
this
one
above
and
beyond
what
i
expect
from
an
old
ale

drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
molasses
smoke
wood
whisky
and
some
oxidation
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
whisky
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
and
a
very
slight
tang
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
complex
aromas
that
i
am
enjoying
slightly
more
than
the
flavor
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
no
head
theres
some
streaming
carbonation
that
is
visible
on
the
side
of
the
glass
but
there
isnt
a
lot
of
it
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
oak
vanilla
and
some
alcoholic
character
from
the
scotch
theres
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
as
well
as
the
alcohol
the
taste
follows
the
nose
for
the
most
part
theres
a
nice
malt
backbone
that
has
some
dark
roastiness
and
toffee
sweetness
that
mingles
with
the
oak
vanilla
and
scotch
those
oak
characteristics
really
blend
nicely
with
the
flavors
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
light
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
drinks
pretty
well
for
a
bigger
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
very
good
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
complexity
big
roast
oak
and
vanilla
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
superior
in
some
ways
to
the
18yr
oddly
the
pour
is
a
matte
black
color
deep
chocolate
brown
fairly
thick
and
with
only
a
thin
finger
of
tan
bubbles
the
nose
is
raw
cocoa
and
scotch
its
musty
and
oaky
and
the
malt
is
about
as
black
as
it
can
be
without
being
bitter
and
burnt
the
alcohol
smells
are
beautiful
in
this
beer
the
barrel
has
obviously
done
quite
a
bit
to
this
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
unsweetened
there
is
some
vanilla
and
toasted
coconut
but
none
of
that
is
sugary
the
alcohol
adds
flavor
without
burn
and
it
actually
has
a
very
mellow
feel
dark
chocolate
and
bran
muffin
are
the
dominant
flavors
in
the
finish
in
addition
to
the
scotch
whiskey
full
body
and
a
smooth
feel
maybe
a
little
chalky
but
the
finish
is
long
and
complex
there
is
much
to
appreciate
about
this
special
brew
a
very
different
tune
to
this
than
the
american
barrel
aged
beers
there
is
something
particularly
well
refined
about
this
polished
and
calculated
intentional
as
opposed
to
the
sometimes
random
chance
barrel
offerings
from
this
country
very
impressive
o
man
are
these
ola
dubh
style
old
ales
good
a
great
brewery
paired
with
a
great
distillery
is
what
any
geek
dreams
of
ola
dubh
is
just
that
the
12
was
pure
class
and
the
16
may
be
even
better
next
is
the
18
sitting
in
my
fridge
these
ales
are
a
must
try
and
something
ill
definitely
have
again
o
the
beer
serves
as
a
nice
palate
to
carry
the
scotch
flavors
the
underling
beer
is
a
bit
had
to
see
under
that
but
with
the
chocolate
and
the
roast
im
apt
to
call
it
a
stout
and
not
an
old
ale
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
conclusion
i
love
old
beer
and
i
love
it
more
when
it
still
tastes
this
good
not
exactly
what
i
expected
and
all
the
savory
flavors
are
a
bit
disappointing
but
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
6
year
old
beer
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
now
i
want
to
find
a
fresher
bottle
o
pleasant
enjoyable
if
you
like
scotch
then
give
this
series
a
whirl
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
spot
on
for
an
old
ale
this
particular
one
was
bottled
in
july
2011
so
its
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
id
definitely
have
again
im
apparently
a
sucker
for
pricey
beer
ill
have
to
add
this
one
to
the
rotation
and
age
a
few
as
well
grabbed
a
bottle
from
gainesville
hob
pours
porter
or
stout
like
with
no
head
whatsoever
smell
is
faint
maybe
a
bit
of
scotch
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
a
little
bit
of
peat
and
motor
oil
flavor
is
chocolate
scotch
oak
smoke
more
complex
than
i
expected
from
the
smell
medium
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
this
was
really
nice
and
smokyroasty
interesting
english
style
old
ale
with
a
smoke
and
peat
flavors
lent
from
aging
in
highland
park
16
year
old
single
malt
scotch
whiskey
casks
has
a
rich
aroma
of
raisins
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
leather
the
aroma
is
very
nice
the
taste
started
off
a
little
smokey
for
me
but
mellowed
a
little
and
became
much
more
enjoyable
the
smoke
is
pretty
well
blended
but
if
it
were
a
little
more
in
the
background
i
think
i
would
give
taste
a
higher
rating
as
it
is
it
is
a
beer
worth
a
try
the
base
old
ale
is
very
good
and
the
addition
of
the
whiskey
casks
adds
a
lot
of
richness
to
the
beer
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
again
in
a
few
years
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
isnt
worth
the
price
the
base
beer
is
completely
dominated
by
the
scotch
barrel
and
it
is
incredibly
thin
almost
like
water
overall
this
one
is
not
worth
trying
at
the
price
point
its
at
o
could
be
more
balanced
in
terms
of
barrel
flavors
but
nonetheless
a
treat
to
drink
o
fantastic
beer
coupled
with
a
cool
evening
and
a
fire
pit
you
have
a
match
made
in
heaven
overall
not
the
most
interesting
beer
but
tasty
well
see
how
different
the
other
bottles
are
this
one
is
better
than
the
others
if
i
remember
correctly
i
aged
it
too
long
in
my
opinion
cheers
lampertland
overall
i
like
these
beers
equally
well
they
are
very
similar
but
there
are
subtle
differences
the
16
is
a
bit
fruitier
and
has
more
vanilla
than
the
12
i
really
want
to
try
the
other
3
ola
dubh
varieties
now
o
so
complex
and
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
with
a
delightful
melding
of
dark
beer
and
scotch
flavors
even
better
than
the
12
year
which
was
considerably
less
smokey
i
dont
enjoy
overly
smokey
beers
but
this
one
has
a
striking
balance
damn
near
perfect
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
the
colour
on
this
is
a
gorgeous
deep
brownblack
that
has
red
tints
when
held
up
to
the
light
looks
pretty
black
in
the
glass
with
a
very
thin
brownish
head
on
the
nose
there
were
heaps
of
caramel
molasses
and
spice
you
dont
get
cheated
flavourwise
either
when
it
comes
to
the
highland
park
whiskey
notes
they
are
all
over
this
intense
barrelaged
brew
it
actually
made
me
want
to
chase
each
sip
with
a
wee
sip
of
whiskey
o
this
is
a
good
beer
definitely
for
sipping
however
i
dont
know
if
the
price
justifies
trying
it
more
than
once
o
not
a
very
good
beer
certainly
not
worth
the
money
i
might
drink
it
again
but
i
would
certainly
never
seek
it
out
or
recommend
it
m
the
best
mouthfeel
of
the
three
wellbalanced
with
a
winning
peated
salt
finish
the
bold
malts
pair
nicely
with
chocolatey
richness
an
interesting
contrast
to
the
typical
sweet
sticky
booziness
of
common
barrel
aged
beers
this
one
albeit
black
as
night
sits
pretty
easy
on
the
palate
and
isnt
particularly
cloying
at
all
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
for
the
faint
hearted
as
it
drinks
more
like
a
big
ol
smokey
scotch
than
your
typical
barrel
aged
fare
that
in
mind
it
certainly
drinks
well
and
demands
that
you
respect
it
and
sip
slowly
great
smoky
flavor
offset
by
a
faint
backbone
of
dark
roastiness
ive
recently
developed
a
liking
to
scotch
whisky
both
single
malts
and
blended
and
because
of
that
i
appreciated
this
that
much
more
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
well
rounded
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
peatiness
is
present
but
far
from
overpowering
or
offputting
it
serves
to
compliment
the
chocolatey
rich
roastiness
of
the
beer
placed
in
the
casks
and
that
it
does
so
very
well
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
18
30
and
40
sitting
in
my
cellar
o
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
one
that
i
could
enjoy
sipping
on
all
day
long
there
is
a
nice
complexity
and
balance
to
both
the
taste
and
the
smell
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
one
again
along
with
its
sibling
versions
that
are
aged
in
different
barrels
very
enjoyable
and
very
smooth
3
5
d
very
tasty
with
only
the
body
causing
complaints
quality
beer
overall
glad
i
tried
this
pretty
shortly
after
the
12
year
version
the
beers
are
definitely
very
similar
the
biggest
differences
are
that
the
whisky
is
a
little
more
subtle
in
flavor
on
this
one
and
there
is
definitely
less
peat
sticking
out
there
is
definitely
some
noticeable
scotch
flavor
here
without
any
booziness
and
the
fairly
thin
mouth
makes
it
easier
to
drink
still
pretty
expensive
about
9
here
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
but
a
good
occasional
sipping
old
ale
another
good
beer
in
this
line
will
review
the
40
year
version
at
some
point
before
too
long
to
see
how
it
compares
a
very
nice
beer
with
plenty
of
balance
and
lots
of
flavour
really
well
crafted
o
wow
this
is
an
excellent
sipper
beer
rich
complex
satisfying
and
quite
a
bit
whiskylike
perfect
for
whisky
lovers
who
want
to
find
something
similar
in
the
world
of
craft
beer
much
better
than
the
old
engine
oil
o
if
you
can
handle
all
of
the
smoky
flavors
this
beer
goes
down
quite
easily
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
o
a
really
flavorful
barrel
aged
beer
i
dont
know
if
old
ale
is
really
the
right
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
will
definitely
have
to
get
some
of
the
other
versions
eventually
im
glad
we
had
some
bcbs
for
a
midnight
toasting
as
well
because
ola
dubh
special
reserve
16
was
more
of
a
ticker
beer
than
a
memorable
toast
to
a
new
year
flavors
of
bitter
chocolate
and
smoke
hint
of
vanilla
got
more
of
the
scotch
character
on
the
palate
than
the
nose
get
a
nice
bit
of
peat
in
the
mid
palate
medium
to
full
body
overall
well
done
i
could
drink
this
all
day
everyday
well
crafted
would
be
an
understatement
would
be
great
as
an
after
dinner
nightcap
or
cigar
beer
glad
i
came
across
this
one
d
better
than
the
reserve
12
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
reserve
30
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
big
earthy
flavors
these
ola
dubh
ales
have
to
offer
well
worth
the
premium
price
now
all
i
need
to
do
is
get
my
hands
on
a
reserve
40
its
a
complete
package
attractive
packaging
that
holds
a
stellar
product
o
would
buy
it
again
if
there
is
nothing
else
lol
a
good
beer
a
slightly
thicker
body
would
have
helped
though
o
my
least
favourite
of
the
4
i
have
tried
seemed
to
lack
some
complexity
and
a
touch
too
sweet
from
a
bottle
pours
black
with
a
pretty
large
cappuccino
head
nose
is
a
soft
montage
of

tobacco
peat
leather
whiskeydark
fruits
soft
and
gentle
flavors
are
dark
fruits
and
leather
up
front
light
and
nonassertive
and
really
focus
on
that
tobacco
leaf
through
the
finish
leafy
dry
lightly
bitter
earthy
feel
is
surprisingly
light
one
of
the
more
tobaccoheavy
old
ales
stouts
ive
had
decent
o
if
this
was
a
bit
thicker
i
think
it
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
it
could
also
use
more
depth
especially
as
an
old
ale
o
i
really
like
this
brew
the
vanilla
flavours
are
fantastic
recommended
overall
stunning
beer
i
will
most
certainly
be
having
this
one
again
there
actually
is
a
resemblance
of
highland
park
in
here
and
i
was
very
skeptical
i
get
it
on
the
nose
along
with
some
roasty
notes
cocoa
appearance
was
lacking
with
virtually
no
head
at
all
on
the
palate
a
smooth
beer
comes
across
nicely
with
flavors
of
roasted
malts
peat
smoke
and
some
boozy
qualities
resembling
the
aforementioned
whisky
finishes
roasty
and
hot
a
slow
sipper
overall
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
but
the
scotch
overtakes
the
beer
a
little
too
much
i
do
like
the
scotch
flavor
a
lot
but
it
outcompetes
the
underlying
beer
which
is
a
shame
overall
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavours
but
i
feel
the
barrel
presence
is
a
little
bit
too
subtle
and
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
thin
to
prevent
a
higher
score
nice
nose
though
works
well
overall
shame
there
wasnt
more
on
the
nose
of
this
it
is
otherwise
a
very
nice
whisky
aged
beer
using
one
of
my
favourite
readily
available
single
malts
smooth
but
far
from
viscous
medium
bodied
between
soft
and
firm
lightly
mouthcoating
o
a
big
flavourful
brew
the
whiskey
cask
aging
is
mostly
overwhelmed
but
that
doesnt
matter
as
there
is
enough
flavour
levels
as
is
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
vintages
this
beer
much
like
its
partners
in
crime
pour
out
nice
and
black
thin
looking
brown
head
in
this
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
plenty
of
smokey
whiskeyscotch
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
mouthful
of
scotch
like
flavors
with
some
smokey
and
burnt
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
low
carbonation
kind
of
on
the
oily
side
overall
its
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
i
find
the
older
barrels
to
be
far
better
but
this
was
a
good
starting
point
for
me
o
overall
full
flavoured
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
that
being
said
i
much
preferred
the
30
year
offering
this
one
lacked
the
scotch
notes
that
i
was
hoping
for
bottle
number
12623
and
it
pours
a
dark
as
night
black
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
and
some
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
blackberriesblueberriesbarley
and
oak
i
like
this
smellthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
super
slick
with
tastes
of
carameltoffeeblackberriesdark
bitter
coffee
and
finished
with
a
bittersweet
hit
of
dark
chocolate
and
overall
its
very
interesting
how
this
brew
is
so
different
to
the
12yr
and
yes
i
would
buy
again
so
suited
for
tonights
cold
d
overall
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
was
a
damn
good
sipping
one
excellent
flavors
mixed
very
well
made
it
worth
every
penny
near
black
color
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
tan
head
that
fades
to
nearly
nothing
aroma
of
dark
fruit
plums
boozy
raisins
and
chocolate
scotch
comes
though
much
more
in
the
flavor
meaty
chocolate
flavors
and
a
peaty
finish
a
fairly
light
body
relatively
speaking
actually
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
just
saw
that
there
is
a
40yr
version
that
would
be
awesome
to
try
too
overall
while
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
going
to
appeal
to
everyonein
fact
i
doubt
few
will
be
able
to
enjoy
its
extraordinarily
intense
flavorsit
is
an
amazing
accomplishment
i
doubt
its
possible
to
cram
more
flavor
into
a
bottle
on
a
side
note
i
really
dont
thing
the
difference
between
ale
aged
in
the
10
and
40
year
barrels
really
make
that
much
of
a
difference
stick
to
what
is
cheapest
the
novelty
is
for
scotch
lovers
not
beer

espresso
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
raisins
peat
and
whiskey
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
oily
but
smooth
as
silk
was
really
expecting
a
lot
more
alcohol
burn
but
it
was
subtle
at
best
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
for
a
beer
like
this
it
was
the
perfect
choice
for
an
unseasonably
cold
day
here
in
germany
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
old
ale
but
it
was
a
little
bit
disappointing
the
whiskey
is
there
in
the
nose
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
enjoyable
as
i
was
hoping
for
and
it
was
drown
out
in
the
taste
by
the
smokey
malts
a
bit
still
a
very
good
beer
but
not
really
worth
the
price
tag
in
my
opinion
overall
not
bad
at
all
price
point
of
12
is
a
little
steep
but
judging
by
the
distance
it
traveled
and
the
barrels
it
was
in
i
would
say
it
was
worth
it
especially
to
split
between
2
or
3
people
def
worth
a
try
d
superior
to
the
12
year
old
this
really
portrays
and
showcases
the
scotch
barrels
well
without
being
overpowering
or
boozy
a
fine
old
ale
and
probably
right
at
a
good
age
in
the
bottle
at
this
point
good
stuff
drinkability
its
efforts
like
this
that
make
me
fall
in
love
all
over
again
with
this
uncommon
style
here
in
the
us
i
would
love
to
throw
10
of
these
in
a
cellar
and
open
one
a
year
for
the
next
ten
years
pours
dark
black
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
version
tastes
slightly
less
roasty
and
smokey
like
the
12
year
but
i
pick
up
more
malt
scotch
whiskey
flavour
in
this
one
insanely
drinkable
for
the
8
the
12
and
16
year
versions
are
some
of
the
best
porters
i
have
had
i
hope
i
am
lucky
enough
to
try
the
other
versions
d
very
complex
flavors
that
go
on
and
keep
changing
long
after
the
swallow
the
wet
wood
in
the
aroma
gives
an
impression
that
the
beer
will
be
stale
but
the
flavors
are
incredible
with
all
the
peat
smoke
this
is
like
a
liquid
cigar
should
i
blow
20
on
the
40
im
leaning
towards
a
no
it
starts
out
kinda
thin
but
then
starts
to
feel
a
little
sticky
an
odd
mouthfeel
but
not
a
bad
one
i
think
i
like
it
slightly
better
than
the
12
a
surprisingly
thin
mouth
feel
for
a
beer
of
this
size
left
this
feeling
a
bit
lopsided
dont
get
me
wrong
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
feel
that
it
needs
some
aging
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
its
a
damn
shame
that
very
little
harviestoun
beer
makes
it
to
these
shores
because
everything
that
ive
had
from
these
guys
is
either
good
or
more
often
great
ola
dubh
special
reserve
16
definitely
deserves
to
be
released
again
and
again
and
again
a
very
dangerous
thing
d
wow
amazing
beer
so
so
good
want
more
i
really
like
this
series
of
beer
they
are
all
very
tasty
all
through
the
different
ages
the
base
from
which
they
start
is
really
good
without
the
ageing
in
the
whiskey
casks
so
the
whiskey
really
adds
that
extra
character
that
makes
this
an
award
winning
brew
if
you
like
dark
beers
then
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
one
d
i
recall
the
40
to
be
much
better
than
this
though
pleasing
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
tasty
and
nice
but
i
recall
the
12
being
much
more
flavorful
balanced
and
interesting
d
pretty
drinkable
not
as
punishing
as
the
30
year
old
although
the
mouthfeel
does
bring
down
the
overall
quality
of
the
beer
it
helps
to
make
it
more
drinkable
as
it
is
much
less
filling
than
many
similar
beers
worth
trying
even
with
a
large
price
tag
not
a
massive
amount
of
character
from
the
barrel
but
i
like
the
subtle
aspect
from
the
woody
smokey
earth
i
like
an
old
ale
and
this
one
is
no
exception
thanks
to
a
awesome
ba
who
sent
this
out
to
me
it
finally
tried
this
one
i
seen
it
sitting
on
the
selves
but
never
pulled
the
plug
on
buying
one
my
mistake
i
sat
on
the
bottle
for
a
year
and
when
i
cracked
it
open
i
got
a
slight
hiss
of
carbonation
so
i
got
a
little
bit
of
a
tan
head
in
the
pour
the
body
was
black
in
color
the
brew
was
light
bodied
or
to
say
thin
in
the
viscosity
department
you
get
a
ton
of
peat
in
the
nose
but
so
the
barrel
did
its
job
flavor
wise
more
of
the
same
good
scotch
notes
oak
and
peat
with
a
touch
of
smoke
vanilla
showed
up
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
its
a
great
brew
a
tad
pricey
but
worth
the
coin
i
would
buy
one
on
my
own
after
trying
this
one
it
seems
that
the
ola
dubhs
steeped
in
relatively
younger
highland
park
barrels
exhibit
significantly
fewer
pungent
oceanside
characteristics
which
in
the
end
renders
this
a
nicely
balanced
barrelaged
old
ale
thats
not
to
say
that
the
north
sea
doesnt
well
inform
this
one
another
splendid
rejiggering
of
old
engine
oil
it
certainly
does
d
an
enjoyable
sipper
drink
this
beer
is
really
complex
and
has
a
lot
of
different
flavours
going
on
although
it
isnt
my
favourite
style
of
beer
im
really
happy
i
gave
it
a
try
and
i
suggest
others
do
the
same
d
extremely
drinkable
booziness
where
are
you
imo
the
prime
example
of
the
ola
dubh
series
smooth
and
mildy
watered
down
at
times
but
ample
carbonation
helps
work
this
out
d
very
good
i
could
have
a
number
of
these
full
flavoured
and
a
warming
beer
for
the
weather
well
blended
and
captures
whiskey
elements
well
not
a
bad
beer
overall
really
the
smoke
is
great
but
its
a
strange
beer
in
that
all
categories
of
this
beer
do
not
line
up
looks
viscous
feel
is
not
smells
like
a
strong
ale
tastes
like
a
smoke
beer
sort
of
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
colour
with
thin
yet
thick
tan
head
dissipates
to
a
small
ring
of
head
with
some
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
like
chocolate
cherry
roast
smoke
and
some
peat
the
smoke
may
be
a
bit
too
prevalent
here
overpowers
much
of
the
other
flavours
very
sweet
alcohol
is
noticeable
chimney
smoke
is
huge
in
the
aftertaste
very
smooth
mouthfeel
i
typically
love
smoke
i
had
a
laphroig
quarter
cask
last
night
but
i
think
it
is
too
much
in
this
beer
for
some
reason
im
having
ambivalent
feelings
about
this
one
not
because
it
isnt
a
good
barrel
aged
ale
but
because
the
reserve
18
just
seems
more
superior
in
comparison
still
a
well
put
together
ale
worth
trying
with
the
ola
dubh
series
harviestoun
has
tried
to
turn
people
on
to
a
more
gastronomically
distinctive
product
if
theyve
provoked
at
least
some
beer
drinkers
to
recognize
a
part
of
their
palate
they
didnt
know
existed
then
theyve
accomplished
that
mission
their
craftsmanship
has
certainly
reaffirmed
my
affection
for
barrelaged
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
greatly
improved
over
the
12
its
silky
smooth
the
body
feels
a
bit
heavier
perhaps
due
to
the
less
prickling
carbonation
as
a
result
drinkability
is
also
somewhat
improved
better
than
the
12
but
not
as
good
as
the
higher
numbers
drinkability
is
the
same
as
the
12
smooth
and
very
tasty
but
definitely
something
you
want
to
sit
and
savor

i
was
surprized
that
the
substantial

was

light
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
rate
it
more
highly
than
the
12
great
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
cant
wait
to
try
the
40
year
i
have
only
tried
this
and
the
12
and
i
find
the
scotch
characteristics
to
be
a
bit
more
subdued
in
this
version
i
found
there
to
be
less
smokiness
and
a
slightly
more
boozy
finish
regardless
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
look
forward
to
sampling
the
rest
of
the
series
if
i
can
find
a
friend
or

to
split
with

rich

bitter
dark
chocolate
here
too
and
the
slightest
hint
of
dark

some
plum

a
bit
of
charcoal
and
the
whiskey
underlies
this
entire
process
smooth
and
slick
mouthfeel
full
and
warming
lingering
smoke
and
roastiness
finish
it
off
a
sipper
and
good
for
the
cooler
parts
of
the
year
not
as
good
as
the
12
served
in
a

very
dark

color

a
thin

a

light

roasted

a

the
taste
is
a

a

bit
of
oak
and
some
light
whisky
character
really
nice
feel
that
captures
all
the
elements
well
drinks
nicely
and
is
a
solid
sipper
an
enjoyable
old
ale
hard
to
be
more
specific
but
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
especially
if
you
enjoy
the
style
d
quite
drinkable
definitely
worth
the
18
i
spent
on
it
but
apparently
my
state
didnt
get
too
many
cases
of
this
so
im
grateful
for
the
opportunity
afforded
by
seeing
this
in
the
store
overall
could
have
been
better
just
not
a
big
enough
beer
a
very
interesting
beer
made
all
the
more
enjoyable
with
the
addition
of
the
complexity
of
highland
park
scotch
note
i
had
the
special
reserve
12
later
and
enjoyed
this
16
more
however
the
12
was
bottled
7
months
earlier
than
the
16
and
maybe
that
was
part
of
the
difference
i
tried
this
vertically
with
the
12
and
unfortunately
this
one
was
not
the
winner
theyre
very
similar
except
the
16
seems
a
lot
more
watery
and
less
flavorful
the
roasted
smoky
characteristics
are
a
little
muted
here
still
pretty
good
overall
but
i
might
actually
go
for
an
old
engine
oil
over
this
and
a
12
over
both
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
a
little
on
the
intrusive
side
but
still
enjoyed
this
drinkability
a
step
down
from
the
12
in
my
opinion
still
a
solid
beer
lots
of
good
aromas
and
flavors
but
a
little
less
complex
a
little
more
watery
and
a
little
more
spicy
in
an
unappealing
way

but
i
would
compare
it
more
with
a

stout
the
subtle
nuances
of
the
single
malt
really
add
to
the
excellent
qualities
of
the
beer
to
make
it
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts

you
havent

this
is

than
the

tobacco
best
of
the

series
i
have
had
bit
more
sweetness
and
chocolate
still
nice
smokey

but
not
as
dry
and
boring
as
some
of
the
higher
numbered

ones
nicely
done

super
thick
lighter
carb
booze
hidden
well
overall
full
rich
interesting
and
tasty
brew
very
good
but
a
bit
expensive
this
beer
has
a
strong
iron
smell
along
with
other
minerals
it
tastes
of
a
wet
gravel
pit
the
oak
is
there
and
offers
some
nice
tannins
and
vanilla
notes
with
plenty
of
peat
and
mineral
flavors
coming
from
barrels
and
water
there
is
baking
chocolate
flavor
also
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
probably
the
most
interesting
beer
i
have
had
under
10
bucks
i
would
definitely
buy
again
and
cant
wait
to
try
a
taste
of
all
three
barrels
aged
beers
o
so
ya
i
probably
let
this
one
sit
to
long
it
has
a
overwhelming
smoke
peat
flavor
almost
intense
malts
and
scotch
follow
up
nicely
after
the
finish
is
a
smokey
mixture
of
malt
and
slight
scotch
still
really
good
if
you
like
heavy
smoked
beer
enjoy
overall
tasty
good

good
lord
if
you
find
this
on
tap
you
should
kick
yourself
if
you
dont
try
this
awesome
brew
enough
said
o
a
bit
thin
and
slightly
harsh
from
the
alcohol
mostly
a
lot
of
interesting
flavor
but
a
bit
offbalance
overall
excellent
this
is
a
flavorful
well
balanced
and
complex
brew
with
just
the
right
amount
of
peat
as
well
though
ive
never
had
it
fresh
i
can
imagine
letting
it
sit
until
after
the
best
by
date
did
no
bit
of
harm
perhaps
a
touch
more
weight
and
a
slightly
darker
colored
head
would
make
this
the
perfect
scotch
barreled
stout
if
youre
a
monster
peat
fan
this
wont
quite
satisfy
your
craving
however
if
you
enjoy
layered

and
can
appreciate

this
will
be
right
up

an
impressive
a
my
only
regret
concerning
ola
dubh
special
reserve
12
is
that
i
neglected
to
pick
up
a
second
bottle
of
the
stuff
this
is
a
delicious
ale
that
i
would
recommend
highly
to
all
bas
looking
for
a
proper
oak
aged
beer
and
may
also
have
some
appeal
to
scotch
whisky
fans
as
well
its
not
cheap
but
i
dont
mind
paying
for
quality
and
with
that
in
mind
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
the
other
beers
in
the
ola
dubh
series
o
i
decided
to
let
this
bottle
go
after
finding
myself
with
a
couple
of
the
ola
dubh
special
reserve
30s
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
and
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
wait
longer
to
open
it
as
i
feel
it
would
have
only
gotten
better
there
is
so
much
flavor
and
character
in
this
beer
that
i
wish
it
was
a
750
ml
instead
of
a
330
ml
so
that
i
could
enjoy
it
longer
now
if
i
can
get
the
one
away
from
my
buddy
that
i
know
he
has
overall
a
little
thinwatery
and
the
wood
doesnt
really
show
up
much
im
also
not
a
fan
of
a
smoked
meat
type
flavour
in
my
beer
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
topnotch
as
barrelaged
stouts
go
this
is
quite
subtle
but
the
character
is
wonderfully
integrated
looks
the
part
with
an
aroma
and
flavour
of
rich
roasted
malt
dried
fruit
and
subtle
whisky
highlights
the
body
is
satisfyingly
unctuous
though
a
little
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
delicious
a
touchstone
in
uk
barrelaged
brews
this
should
go
on
your
musttry
list
poured
from
330
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
13114
overall
a
very
good
yet
rather
different
old
ale
that
really
emphasizes
smoke
probably
one
of
the
two
or
three
smokiest
beers
ive
had
that
isnt
rauchbier
and
while
the
price
is
rather
steep
this
is
one
beer
im
glad
i
could
say
i
tried
since
it
was
a
unique
experience
to
me
i
poured
it
in
to
a
chimay
chalice
and
saw
that
this
stuff
looks
like
old
motor
oil
no
problem
though
im
cool
with
that
unfortunately
that
was
last
thing
i
was
cool
with
concerning
this
beer
there
was
only
a
mild
aroma
and
the
beer
tasted
even
less
dramatic
with
very
little
carbonation
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
bland
unremarkable
beer
that
definitely
wasnt
worth
the
price
cannot
recommend
next
step
if
i
can
find
a
bottleharvistoun
engine
oil
overall
impressive
for
only
8
recommended
in
some
ways
i
like
12
better
than
16
or
18
the
reason
being
that
it
still
tastes
like
beer
although
some
may
say
this
is
still
more
whiskey
than
beer
to
me
its
the
perfect
balance
dark
brown
in
color
rich
for
an
old
ale
same
looks
as
the
others
with
perhaps
a
little
better
head
but
its
been
awhile
and
this
one
is
on
tap
the
nose
is
great
woody
and
earthy
and
rich
in
malt
profile
well
roasted
and
toasted
not
burnt
but
real
dark
the
whiskey
isnt
sharp
but
mellow
and
clean
strong
too
smells
like
more
than
8
abv
thats
for
sure
the
taste
is
great
tons
of
roast
and
body
without
any
bitterness
the
whiskey
treatment
is
very
effective
the
beer
has
some
charcoal
to
it
as
well
as
vanilla
and
oak
but
not
in
a
sweet
way
its
more
refined
more
old
school
in
some
sense
more
precise
more
groovy
hard
to
describe
its
all
balanced
up
well
like
the
whiskey
characteristics
could
be
controlled
independently
of
one
another
you
know
less
vanilla
here
more
oak
there
even
though
thats
not
possible
it
seems
that
well
dialed
in
i
prefer
this
to
the
16
and
18
honestly
although
i
would
still
love
to
try
the
older
ones
this
is
a
genuinely
great
beer
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
english
style
old
ale
i
like
old
ales
barley
wines
etc
this
one
is
good
if
you
like
peat
smoke
scotch
whiskey
aromas
and
enjoy
bacon
with
your
beer
earthy
roasted
malts
smoked
wood
minimal
whiskey
flavors
peat
very
earthy
nice
flavors
although
very
still
no
carbonation
seems
a
little
thin
from
what
i
was
expecting
but
id
like
to
try
the
others
o
overall
a
beer
that
is
definitely
very
good
but
hard
to
justify
for
the
price
i
actually
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
the
16
but
again
not
worth
the
price
for
me
at
12glass
or
even
more
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
lots
of
chocolate
and
scotch
to
it
if
you
dont
like
scotch
id
suggest
saving
your
money
for
something
else
if
you
have
the
money
to
spend
and
like
scotchold
ales
this
series
would
be
fun
to
check
out
you
gotta
like
scotch
to
appreciate
this
not
very
complex
and
lacks
body
reading
all
the
reviews
i
was
expecting
more
o
great
beer
complex
and
dynamic
o
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
well
balanced
by
the
sweetness
and
the
barrel
aging
cheers
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
a
let
down
really
not
much
of
a
body
to
support
what
is
in
every
other
way
a
huge
beer
as
expected
for
the
style
carbonation
is
very
low
the
taste
is
smokey
with
whiskey
dominating
the
taste
i
would
have
to
describe
as
an
oaky
smokey
beer
flavored
whiskey
without
the
alcohol
punch
i
like
it
disclaimer
this
bottle
was
purchased
in
las
vegas
cold
and
not
kept
at
optimum
temperature
i
have
another
bottle
2011
purchased
at
the
highland
park
distillery
that
has
been
more
properly
stored
may
change
my
assessment
after
opening
that
one
overall
this
beer
was
good
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
given
the
chance
however
im
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
on
a
regular
basis
overall
a
great
barrel
aged
beer
lots
of
smokiness
and
oak
cask
flavors
yet
not
too
much
would
buy
again
but
i
prefer
the
special
18
reserve
which
is
only
a
few
dollars
more
o
interesting
old
ale
scotch
notes
are
not
too
harsh
but
rather
well
integrated
nice
and
mellow
great
balance
of
scotch
flavors
and
roasted
malt
it
may
be
due
to
the
age
but
the
smoke
is
nicely
subdued
sweetened
by
the
milk
chocolate
ends
up
being
a
really
nice
combination
o
ola
dubh
12
is
a
well
made
beer
consistent
with
equilibrium
and
good
taste
combination
of
flavours
and
smells
i
think
that
every
beer
lover
must
try
this
beer
overall
impression
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
ale
it
obviously
takes
in
a
fair
amount
of
scotch
character
from
the
barrel
to
balance
roasted
malts
with
peatysmoky
flavor
dark
chocolate
and
sugar
sweetness
are
prevalent
in
the
middle
of
the
drink
but
subside
slightly
as
the
roastiness
comes
back
in
the
finish
i
think
this
is
a
stellar
ale
with
the
only
draw
back
being
the
slightly
too
alcoholic
nose
i
am
attributing
this
nose
to
the
fact
that
the
ale
was
aged
in
12year
whiskey
barrels
rather
than
older
whiskey
so
the
alcoholic
notes
in
the
barrel
will
be
less
mellowed
and
more
pervasive
thus
more
pervasive
in
the
ale
fantastic
beer
overall
though
o
a
subtle
floral
edge
vanilla
coffee
slight
earthiness
very
nice
beer
overall
with
a
pleasant
dry
finish
4
25
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
complex
mildly
alcoholic
with
my
untrained
palate
i
couldnt
feel
the
whiskey
cask
ageing
kick
in
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
immensely
the
beer
is
black
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
offers
roast
chocolate
alcohol
oak
smoke
scotch
very
nice
lovely
flavor
following
the
scent
easy
to
sip
and
savor
medium
bodied
vanilla
chocolate
light
booze
the
12
year
was
a
bit
smoother
than
the
21
year
actually
though
the
barrel
character
was
less
pronounced
all
in
all
a
delicious
beer
o
most
dominate
scotch
presence
in
all
of
the
series
this
is
my
favorite
version
m
creamy
and
medium
bodied
a
nice
sipping
beer
o
this
is
my
first
harviestoun
brew
but
wont
be
my
last
i
really
enjoyed
the
12
and
will
pick
up
a
few
more
ill
do
the
16
in
a
few
days
but
for
now
im
left
admiring
a
brilliant
black
old
ale
im
big
on
scotch
and
bourbon
and
this
one
is
pure
class
id
recommend
highland
park
scotch
to
anyone
and
after
this
i
can
say
harviestoun
puts
the
same
amount
of
brilliance
and
class
into
this
ale
a
real
treat
o
ive
had
my
share
of
scotch
this
comes
across
as
a
great
scotch
beer
really
peaty
smokey
and
smooth
as
velvet
overall
some
really
great
character
to
this
beer
definitely
at
least
partially
imparted
by
the
scotch
barrels
always
like
a
brew
that
takes
you
on
a
ride
of
experiences
from
first
sniff
to
finish
and
this
is
one
of
them
while
this
bottle
was
enjoyed
from
a
glen
cairn
snifter
with
george
it
would
be
fantastic
for
reading
or
contemplation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
blended
and
executed
very
nicely
by
coincidence
my
scores
for
the
ola
dubh
series
rise
as
the
age
of
the
whiskey
barrels
do
id
love
to
say
that
it
was
intentional
overall
quite
tasty
and
well
worth
a
try
it
had
a
nice
roasted
and
whiskey
flavor
with
all
the
flavors
melding
well
throughout
the
taste
experience
overall
decent
id
not
buy
it
again
though
the
16
had
a
much
improved
barrel
character
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
love
this
beer
so
excited
that
i
finally
found
it
im
a
huge
whisky
fan
so
having
the
two
combined
is
certainly
a
huge
perk
i
find
this
beer
intense
but
very
inviting
and
welcoming
the
alcohol
level
is
appropriate
and
the
concentration
really
propels
this
beer
to
the
next
level
amazing
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
black
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
there
are
some
visible
alcohol
legs
i
pick
up
the
aroma
of
dark
roasted
barley
malt
chocolate
oak
and
that
familiar
whisky
aroma
those
dark
roasted
malt
notes
hit
up
front
and
the
whisky
comes
right
through
in
the
back
i
also
detect
that
oak
and
chocolate
from
the
nose
the
malt
profile
almost
comes
across
as
porterlike
many
of
those
flavors
come
through
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
full
with
low
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
but
also
sticky
it
is
easy
to
consume
for
an
8
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
pours
a
blackish
brown
no
head
no
lacing
smells
of
malt
soysauce
whiskey
and
thats
about
it
taste
really
is
not
that
great
soy
sauce
whiskey
none
of
the
old
ale
flavors
that
im
used
to
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
overall
man
this
was
a
major
let
down
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
and
now
i
wish
i
could
get
my
money
back
very
underwhelming
and
just
not
very
good
flavors
too
much
soy
sauce
and
little
of
anything
else
good
once
was
one
to
many
great
beer
for
the
scotch
lover
cheers
lampertland
overall
this
is
a
very
good
and
satisfying
beer
it
is
wellcrafted
and
id
definitely
have
it
again
long
warming
finish
even
though
abv
is
only
8
o
i
wish
this
tasted
as
it
smells
because
it
has
quite
a
burnt
flavour
profile
i
was
expecting
something
sweeter
with
more
caramel
and
chocolate
flavours
however
it
is
still
enjoyable

d
these
beers
smell
great
but
then
ultimately
disappoint
the
base
for
these
is
weak
and
the
barrel
overshadows
it
by
far
too
much
only
the
18
year
to
go
then
im
done
with
this
unsatisfying
overpriced
series
o
a
beer
that
you
definitely
should
take
your
time
to
drink
the
smells
and
tastes
are
its
strengths
o
nothing
spectacular
really
just
a
fancy
label
couldnt
taste
much
of
the
barrel
flavor
because
it
is
overdominated
by
smoked
malts
o
worth
a
try
perhaps
but
not
worth
buying
again
especially
at
the
price
point
actually
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
at
half
the
price
too
roastysmoky
and
does
not
have
enough
complexity
to
redeem
itself
good
beer
m
dry
on
the
finish
the
barrel
doesnt
completely
take
over
the
ale
the
pairing
for
flavors
is
nice
though
a
sweet
nightcap
with
little
doubt
a
good
introduction
to
the
old
dubh
series
fans
of
scotch
are
sure
to
love
this
beer
too
it
pours
out
a
deep
brown
small
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
the
scotch
jumping
right
out
at
me
dark
fruits
and
roasted
malts
are
hanging
out
underneath
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
the
dark
fruits
and
roasted
malts
of
the
old
ale
coming
through
first
but
an
excellent
whisky
taste
coming
through
at
the
end
with
a
touch
of
peat
and
smoke
very
good
the
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
actually
quite
good
a
great
barrelaged
beer
recommended
for
the
scotch
fan
overall
a
neat
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
was
not
sure
about
the
sweetness
but
by
the
end
of
the
brew
i
got
it
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
pours
a
dark
brown
cola
like
color
with
little
to
no
light
escaping
when
held
to
the
light
the
beer
starts
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
off
white
head
which
recedes
immediately
and
leaves
sticky
lines
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
then
a
nice
big
whiskey
barrell
aroma
the
taste
has
a
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
up
front
which
gives
way
to
a
slight
dark
fruit
sweetness
there
is
then
a
slight
vanilla
flavor
before
the
taste
of
whiskey
takes
over
and
finishes
the
beer
off
the
mouthfeel
is
mildly
carbonated
and
sticky
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
an
easy
drink
despite
the
high
alcohol
the
whiskey
barrell
is
very
pronounced
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
o
very
nice
beer
very
tasty
and
not
too
heavy
or
overwhelming
nice
balance
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
old
ale
the
sweeter
molasses
and
fruit
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
whisky
barrel
it
has
a
nice
complexity
from
this
the
barrel
would
be
interesting
if
it
was
integrated
a
little
more
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
its
very
good
asis
regardless
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
even
at
the
very
high
price
9
19
for
11
2
oz
for
me
o
im
not
even
a
huge
dark
beer
guy
but
this
is
amazing
cant
wait
to
try
the
16year
overall
quite
nice
doesnt
hurt
that
i
am
like
highland
park
very
much
overall
a
great
beer
with
lots
of
character
if
you
like
scotch
you
will
enjoy
this
this
is
quite
tasty
definitely
wasnt
wowed
by
it
buy
still
tasty
overall
this
dark
brooding
mixture
borrows
characteristics
from
a
scotch
or
scotch
whiskey
more
than
it
does
a
whiskey
i
think
any
scotch
connoisseur
will
tell
you
this
i
used
to
be
quite
nerdy
about
scotch
before
i
discovered
beer
this
is
the
peat
first
and
foremost
this
is
what
blends
with
the
beer
to
give
it
that
dark
woody
smokey
flavor
at
only
8
there
is
not
a
lot
to
hide
here
in
terms
of
alcohol
in
comparison
to
beers
like
the
abt
12
or
the
cuvée
van
de
keizer
blue
but
regardless
this
is
a
reasonably
smooth
ale
a
wonderful
change
a
wonderful
experience
now
i
need
to
run
out
and
try
other
vintage
years
i
should
note
this
beer
was
served
cold
perhaps
with
the
chance
to
raise
to
an
appropriate
temperature
the
flavor
would
have
been
more
present
o
i
thought
it
was
pretty
drinkable
but
not
all
that
good
thought
this
would
be
way
better
hopefully
that
isnt
true
of
the
others
in
the
series
a
bit
too
smoky
with
not
enough
malt
to
balance
it
out
this
brew
poured
out
much
like
the
others
in
the
series
the
beer
was
very
dark
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
faded
very
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
whiskeyscotch
aromas
to
it
along
with
some
other
roasted
chocolaty
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
strong
to
me
i
found
it
to
be
more
harsh
than
the
others
in
the
series
the
mouthfeel
was
with
out
much
carbonation
at
all
the
feel
was
a
little
on
the
watery
side
overall
i
just
wasnt
digging
this
one
too
much
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
would
ever
consider
again
being
that
it
was
my
first
barrel
aged
beer
this
may
be
more
because
i
am
not
fond
of
the
genre
and
less
because
of
the
beer
d
as
already
stated
not
quite
as
good
as
the
reserve
30
but
a
great
beer
that
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
looking
forward
to
the
reserve
16
o
a
rich
and
bold
brew
loaded
with
flavour
certainly
a
afterdinner
drink
and
though
a
tad
pricey
it
is
well
worth
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
overall
a
very
unique
brew
and
one
that
is
certainly
enjoyed
on
a
cold
winter
night
a
very
different
beer
and
worth
the
premium
price
to
try
that
being
said
im
glad
i
dont
own
a
case
of
it
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
drink
it
in
place
of
a
stout
at
times
right
now
as
i
drink
it
i
notice
it
has
some
of
the
warming
qualities
in
my
chest
that
i
get
with
whisky
it
makes
a
great
brew
for
enjoying
on
a
cold
winter
day
had
a
chance
to
grab
some
o
this
stuff
earlier
today
so
i
figured
id
strike
while
the
iron
was
still
relatively
hot
it
pours
a
murky
blackbrown
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
raisins
mild
peat
char
light
roasted
malts
tobacco
light
vinyl
black
pepper
milk
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
man
this
stuff
comes
off
as
allovertheplace
but
in
a
good
way
the
taste
holds
notes
of
candi
sugar
caramel
tobacco
vanilla
cocoa
very
light
peat
smoke
clove
figs
and
light
steak
the
body
is
a
limpid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
swampy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
one
that
shows
how
caskaging
can
really
create
an
artistic
beer
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
this
has
aged
its
a
fantastic
beer
that
has
mellowed
and
developed
quite
nicely
i
would
still
buy
this
and
age
it
again
my
rating
stands
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
just
a
bit
pricey
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
ate
a
piece
of
babybel
bonbel
cheese
between
sips
which
was
a
nice
pairing
i
also
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
while
smoking
a
nice
cigar
i
think
the
malt
backbone
could
be
beefed
up
a
little
more
and
the
feel
could
be
a
little
chewier
additionally
there
was
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
present
but
it
didnt
detract
too
much
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
18
i
find
this
beer
a
little
odd
i
normally
quite
like
dark
barrel
aged
beers
and
im
a
big
fan
of
peated
malts
but
something
about
this
fails
to
come
together
for
me
with
that
barrel
character
really
dominating
the
beer
for
me
o
this
is
a
high
quality
brew
and
is
thoroughly
recommended
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
of
a
very
high
standard
the
beer
after
poured
looks
a
bit
like
soda
the
head
falls
fast
ive
seen
gloopier
looking
beers
drinks
more
like
a
stout
than
an
old
ale
with
nice
whisky
after
notes
not
as
intimidating
as
it
can
potentially
be

12
year
reserve
that
i
had
was
bottled
august
2010
the
bartender
at
casellula
cheese
wine
bar
poured
this
beer
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
an
excellant
dark
tan
two
finger
head
in
the
glass
it
is
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
that
allowed
only
a
smidgen
of
light
to
pass
through
on
the
nose
this
beer
has
aromas
of
roasted
malts
smokiness
and
cellared
oak
in
the
mouth
it
is
very
syrupy
and
creamy
with
smooth
flavors
of
smoked
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
an
awesome
beer
overall
it
was
kind
of
interesting
but
perhaps
not
my
style
as
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
overly
enjoyable
glad
i
decided
against
buying
some
of
the
higher
special
reserves
deep
and
contemplative
smooth
and
drinkable
this
could
go
a
lot
faster
than
it
probably
should
smoky

comes
through
as
the
beer
warms
a
reward
for
slowing
down
wellrounded
im
betting
three
years
in
the
bottle
has
done
good
things
for
this
beer
im
certainly
looking
forward
to
the
16
and
30
year
versions
on

ogood

it

and

a
lovely
sipper
d
overall
its
a
sipping
beer
and
it
is
a
damned
good
sipping
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
very
balanced
strong
beer
which
we
liked
very
much
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
well
every
aspect
except
the
massive
overpowering
smokepeat
flavours
id
like
to
try
the
other
years
and
see
how
they
stack
up
not
impressed
with
this
scotch
id
probably
pair
this
with
some
super
darkchocolate
desserts
maybe
some
dark
chocolate
with
ancho
chilli
or
other
spices
would
be
good
but
to
be
honest
it
really
deserves
to
be
enjoyed
on
its
own
pours
a
luscious
opaque
sable
with
a
respectable
pale
tan
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
strong
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
honey
and
hints
of
caramel
wood
and
malt
flavor
has
caramel
malty
and
woody
tones
with
nutty
woody
and
honey
hints
and
a
touch
of
yeast
texture
is
thick
and
smooth
and
just
a
little
tingly
but
still
pleasing
and
beerlike
oexcellent
beer
so
complex
and
flavorful
while
not
overwhelming
the
pallet
each
flavor
leads
into
the
next
and
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
my
only
complaint
is
the
price
but
its
worth
it
o
this
is
a
great
beer
very
tasty
full
thick
sipping
beer
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
overall
tasty
somewhat
different
from
other
old
ales
ive
had
but
still
quite
good
mouthfeel
is
robust
with
a
velvety
smooth
texture
but
feels
just
a
tad
bit
too
hot
at
this
relatively
young
age
this
bottle
is
about
6mos
old
overall
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
the
16
and
18
yera
versions
o
this
one
caused
me
to
shake
my
head
in
disappointment
not
at
the
beer
of
course
but
at
the
lack
of
recognition
for
the
quality
beers
that
are
being
released
or
have
already
been
around
from
places
outside
of
north
america
a
beer
like
this
is
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
gives
such
a
multifaceted
dynamic
delicious
beer
drinking
experience
that
stands
up
easily
to
the
likes
of
things
like
bcbs
but
on
north
american
forums
youll
almost
never
hear
a
peep
about
it
if
you
have
access
to
this
and
youre
wondering
what
a
topnotch
beer
tastes
like
grab
it
this
one
almost
certainly
wont
disappoint
that
being
said
for
those
who
have
had
some
of
the
generic
greats
of
north
american
barrel
aged
stouts
this
beer
will
take
you
to
a
less
familiar
place
by
playing
with
things
like
whisky
in
successful
fashion
o
this
is
an
excellent
and
complex
ale
its
smokey
character
is
reminiscent
of
a
rauchbier
but
this
is
balanced
against
the
sweet
maltiness
characteristic
of
scotch
ales
fullbodied
rich
low
effervescence
and
decadent
an
absolutely
wonderful
brew
can
i
have
another
please
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
into
a
brandy
snifter
smells
nice
and
roasty
as
well
tastes
of
chocolate
notes
with
a
nice
roasty
smokey
finish
this
is
definately
a
porter
and
not
an
old
ale
mouthfeel
is
beautiful
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
8
beers
i
have
ever
had
wish
i
had
easier
access
to
this
beer
16
year
is
up
next
amazingly
complex
beer
i
guess
you
cant
really
go
wrong
when
you
age
a
huge
malt
bomb
on
a
oak
barrel
taken
from
one
of
the
best
scotch
single
malt
distilleries
in
the
world
overall
very
easy
to
drink
i
was
expecting
more
body
for
a
cask
aged
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
more
this
way
not
as
bold
as
other
cask
aged
beers
also
not
as
obnoxious
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
whiskey
in
the
taste
roasted
malts
earth
and
chocolate
notes
and
a
faint
whiskey
taste
lingering
underneath
it
all
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
chocolate
and
mellow
whiskey
aftertaste
not
as
whiskey
barreled
as
thought
nice
chocolate
presence
and
mellow
for
a
bigger
beer
overall
an
exceptional
beer
very
heavy
tasty
and
complex
a
great
dessert
or
after
dinner
beer
to
savour
by
a
fire
from
the
comfort
of
an
overstuffed
leather
wingback
chair
now
thats
living
this
has
to
be
the
easiest
drinking
of
any
barrel
aged
beer
i
have
tried
to
date
it
was
sort
of
refreshing
to
have
a
beer
of
this
type
that
was
so
laid
back
that
being
said
i
found
that
the
mouthfeel
really
did
a
huge
injustice
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
if
improved
upon
this
tasty
and
unique
beer
would
have
much
more
of
a
complete
package
im
really
a
fan
of
this
one
different
unique
delicious
mouth
feel
is
deceivingly
large
at
first
but
ends
somewhat
thin
for
a
beer
of
this
size
and
flavor
a
very
nice
beverage
overall
the
fact
that
im
drastically
less
impressed
with
barrelaged
beers
in
general
but
have
enjoyed
ola
dubh
special
reserve
12
much
more
now
than
when
i
first
tried
it
some
years
ago
must
say
something
about
the
blend
taste
and
craftsmanship
of
this
product
it
is
a
tremendously
rich
distinct
and
innate
mix
of
scottish
terroir
heritage
and
gastronomy
d
a
nice
sipping
brew
to
share
two
ways
and
enjoy
over
a
lengthier
period
of
time
than
a
normal
brew
drinkability
is
not
too
high
on
this
one
but
of
course
this
is
by
design
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
despite
being
quite
enjoyable
gorgeously
round
and
easy
nightcap
of
a
beer
could
see
this
with
cheese
a
civilized
sipper
dr
i
could
drink
another
but
the
abv
is
poorly
hidden
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
maybe
even
without
the
whiskey
aging
rich
beer
good
overall
but
id
have
to
say
id
probably
take
an
the
old
engine
oil
over
it
for
the
sake
of
value
and
overall
beer
presence
cheers
d
an
interesting
old
ale
that
i
quite
like
rich
and
malty
the
scotch
barrels
really
adds
a
dynamic
level
of
aroma
and
flavor
to
the
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
years
of
this
d
despite
its
strength
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
goes
down
easily
rather
tasty
somewhat
filling
decent
kick
and
good
representation
of
style
the
whisky
character
cannot
be
denied
in
this
however
aged
a
bit
the
heat
is
almost
nonexistent
and
the
full
flavoring
comes
through
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
stands
up
with
aging
a
tasty
and
balanced

of
some

am

talking

this
is
the

roasted

much
like

this
is
a
good
beer
very
well
done
but
i
would
not
see
it
as
one
i
would
drink
often
at
10
per
12oz
it
was
great
to
try
but
not
great
enough
to
buy
again
a
pleasant
barrelaged
beer
and
makes
a
nice
easy
sipper
in
its
own
right
i
would
have
been
far
more
impressed
with
it
had
i
tried
it
before
sampling
the
special
reserve

first
which
is
the
most
superior
of
the
lot
a
good
afterdinner
beer
a
dessert
in
itself
a
delight
to
drink
not
as
complex
or
pungent
as
i
thought
it
might
be
but
delicious
nevertheless
as
for
drinkability
it
goes
down
with
a
distinct
carbonated
feel
almost
a
pucker
and
a
lingering
alcohol
burn
so
youre
going
to
want
to
sip
it
slow
i
dont
want
to
say
its
harsh
but
its
not
really
the
smoothest
beer
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
believe
it
was
worth
the
10
dollars
we
paid
for
12oz
overall
good
but
a
little
simple
i
expected
a
little
more
i
guess

paired
with
the
recommended

i
dont
really
see

appeal

after

enjoyable

to

it

be
an
acquired

the

quaffed

well
this
was
kind
of
a
letdown
for
almost
20
i
would
have
expected
something
that
tasted
more
like
beer
and
less
like
diluted
whisky
too
thin
too
woody
too
little
like
beer
35
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
little
disappointing
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
and
while
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
there
seems
to
be
something
missing
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
at
15
per
11
2
oz
bottle
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
overall
disappointing
the
nose
is
really
good
but
the
rest
doesnt
live
up
i
liked
the
younger
variants
more
o
outstanding
who
needs
innis
gunn
this
is
something
special
ill
be
seeking
out
again
overall
a
complex
tasting
beer
was
a
gift
from
the
wife
and
im
glad
i
got
it
its
been
ahile
since
ive
had
regular
ola
dubh
but
ill
search
some
out
now
o
unlike
anything
i
have
every
tasted
complexity
as
its
finest
a
smooth
feel
with
a
smokey
body
littered
with
scotch
and
chocolate
i
received
this
as
part
of
a
wedding
gift
and
so
glad
i
did
a
true
hidden
gem
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
whim
with
no
knowledge
of
what
i
might
expect
this
experience
revealed
a
new
a
very
delightful
beer
and
brewery
to
me
well
worth
seeking

would
gladly
try
this
again
to
see
if
i
had
some
better
luck
overall
quite
fascinating
complicated
but
also
not
one
that
really
grabs
my
attention
strangely
enough
even
more
so
i
get
no
sense
that
this
comes
from
a
scotch
barrel
at
all
the
taste
man
this
thing
has
a
very
subtle
sweetness
surrounded
by
oak
and
alcohol
im
going
to
say
prayers
tonight
that
one
of
my
favorite
bars
in
new
york
gets
this
on
tap
sometime
soon
im
adding
to
my
bucket
list
visit
scotland
tour
harviestoun
brewery
and
sip
this
stuff
from
the
tap
or
cask
till
i
cant
walk
seriously
this
stuff
is
delicious
ive
enjoyed
the
whole
line
of
the
ola
dubhs
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
at
least
for
me
o
a
lot
peatier
than
the
younger
versions
as
i
mentioned
the
12
had
barely
any
but
the
18
was
nice
this
is
heavy
on
the
peat
having
said
that
its
still
quite
good
i
dont
even
like
scotch
if
you
are
a
scotch
lover
you
will
love
this
beer
i
think
barrel
character
is
substantial
but
not
overpowering
nice
chocolate
malt
really
tries
hard
to
balance
out
the
peat
pretty
mellow
drinking
overall
enjoyable
overall
the
flavors
are
great
in
this
stout
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
terrific
aroma
as
well
the
body
is
a
bit
light
though
and
it
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
the
time
in
the
scotch
barrels
really
helped
this
one
out
though
overall
outstanding
didnt
think
id
get
my
hands
on
one
of
these
and
here
it
is
generosity
of
others
is
such
a
humbling
and
wonderful
thing
o
dances
on
the
palate
just
awesome

with

at

not
much

perhaps
due
in
large
part
to
the
age
of
the
bottle
great
malt
profile
in
aroma
and
taste
theres
an
invigorating
rush
as
it
hits
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
slides
down
your
throat
of
the
other
special
reserves
ive
had
the
12
and
the
16
this
is
the
most
memorable
overall
the
best
ive
had
of
this
series
this
is
also
probably
the
only
one
id
buy
again
but
the
cost
is
prohibitive
i
would
like
to
know
if
this
ages
longer
than
the
others
as
its
barrel
character
is
more
distinct
3
5
d
this
suffers
from
the
same
problem
that
5050
does
the
base
beer
is
weak
and
the
barrel
aging
is
forced
to
carry
the
product
however
in
this
case
the
bourbon
seems
to
have
faded
a
lot
from
the
taste
oh
well
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
overall
this
is
a
heck
of
a
good
sipping
beer
give
it
a
try
this
is
an
absolutely
cracking
beer
obviously
crafted
with
care
and
love
the
beer
itself
is
grand
but
the
whisky
barrel
ages
makes
it

drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sipping
and
ill
be
looking
to
have
this
again
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
whole
series
are
a
great
set
of
beers
one
day
i
hope
to
sample
this
series
of
beers
side
by
side
so
as
to
be
able
to
really
have
a
shot
at
finding
how
the
age
of
the
whisky
that
was
in
the
barrel
affects
the
base
beer
certainly
with
this
one
the
whisky
notes
are
smoother
and
hard
to
separate
out
as
a
different
component
and
there
is
a
definite
smoothness
to
the
flavors
i
dont
remember
from
the
12
and
16
nothing
to
write
home
about
clearly
not
worth
the
price
in
my
book
o
for
its
abv
of
8
it
is
very
very
good
m
the
mouthfeel
starts
out
strong
but
quickly
loses
steam
the
peaty
richness
is
too
quick
to
disappear
d
fantastic
beer
and
one
i
wish
i
could
have
more
often
the
overall
presentation
and
aroma
building
up
to
a
rich
and
powerful
flavor
profile
was
great
all
very
well
done
a
tasty
rounded
and
complex
brew
the
barrel
character
is
much
more
refined
than
in
the
12
year
old
and
the
malt
sweetness
really
shines
delicious
looks
deep
brown
no
head
or
bubbles
except
for
a
razor
thin
ring
smells
like
thick
grape
juice
slightly
peaty
and
some
dry
oak
like
a
peaty
version
of
welchs
taste
is
mostly
raisin
and
plum
again
some
smokepeat
scotch
and
leather
pretty
dry
overall
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
flat
but
at
least
no
alcohol
is
noticeable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
pretty
one
note
and
the
flatness
really
limits
the
drinkability
i
would
pass
on
this
if
offered
again
my
first
experience
with
this
series
of
beers
i
will
be
conducting
a
vertical
tasting
of
the
ola
dubh
highland
park
series
as
soon
as
i
can
a
scotch
drinkers
dream
a
perfect
marriage
of
beer
and
whisky
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
appreciates

oz
i
bought
four
bottles
and
opened
one
today
which
is
a
day
that
i
consider
an
occasion
for
my
budget
a
bottle
like
this
is
not
everyday
drinking
although
i
wish
i
could
but
i
got
a
few
more
left
and
will
hold
on
to
them
for
another
special
day
that
deserves
a
good
brew
odoverall
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
but
the
big
theme
of
this
beer
was
it
being
aged
in
a
great
scotch
barrel
i
personally
was
not
satisfied
with
the
intensity
of
the
scotch
flavors
still
tasty
but
a
bit
disappointing
o
i
expected
a
much
more
alcoholic
beer
after
the
smell
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
backed
off
of
the
booze
ive
heard
great
things
about
these
beers
and
after
my
try
at
the
30
i
know
them
all
to
be
true
the
ola
dubh
special
reserves
seem
like
great
winter
brews
and
scream
campfire
quite
light
bodied
perhaps
medium
and
almost
thin
but
not
a
detracting
point
finishes
fruity
but
dry
a
very
pleasant
beer
bottle
15294
this
one
was
my
favorite
in
the
series
until
i
got
a
hold
of
the
40
year
version
of
this
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
black
thick
looking
liquid
the
head
was
thin
and
brown
is
color
not
much
lacing
here
the
smell
once
again
was
full
of
whiskey
and
barrel
aged
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
quite
good
lots
of
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
scotch
on
the
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
thick
and
smooth
it
coats
the
mouth
pretty
well
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
pricy
but
i
think
to
have
it
once
its
worth
looking
into
bottle
number
36004
and
pours
a
thick
black
used
engine
oil
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves

it
really
is
good
to
see
how
different
each
aged
whiskey
cask
brings
its
own
characteristics
to
make
the
same
drop
taste
different
eachtime
cheers
recommend
trying
at
least
once
the
taste
is
an
embodiment
of
the
smell
with
all
edges
polished
everything
melds
together
into
an
amazing
combination
of
peat
roast
and
wood
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
peat
and
wood
really
stand
out
in
this
beer
i
dont
feel
like
im
really
going
out
on
a
limb
to
say
the
beer
is
here
merely
to
showcase
the
barrel
o
i
think
the
mouth
is
a
very
revealing
part
of
this
beer
there
was
an
aspect
to
it
that
i
couldnt
quite
figure
out
until
i
focused
on
the
mouth
this
beer
is
akin
to
a
block
of
swiss
cheese
it
seems
to
be
the
work
of
an
artisan
but
there
are
some
holes
and
gaps
there
is
a
canvas
here
for
great
pronounced
flavors
however
they
never
really
seem
to
come
there
is
a
bit
of
a
buildup
in
the
nose
and
initial
taste
but
a
bit
of
a
weak
follow
through
noticeably
there
is
a
gap
in
the
middle
coincidentally
this
reminds
me
a
great
deal
of
british
food
while
i
love
peas
and
potatoes
i
could
never
stomach
those
vinegary
mashed
peas
they
serve
with
their
deliciously
rustic
potatoes
it
somehow
leaves
the
overall
feel
of
this
beer
to
be
incomplete
o
i
really
would
reach
for
12
16
again
but
not
sure
id
reach
for
this
twice
beer
didnt
seem
super
dynamic
and
while
wellrounded
and
balanced
what
it
was
rounding
and
balancing
was
a
little
emptier
than
i
would
hope
or
expect
given
12
16
i
still
would
say
this
is
worth
a
shot
though
if
you
have
access
to
this
grab
it
but
to
do
it
justice
it
might
be
worth
checking
out
the
rest
of
the
special
reserves
too
im
curious
to
see
what
40
is
like
d
yet
again
these
keep
getting
better
and
better
as
i
try
each
one
of
these
and
this
one
takes
the
cake
perhaps
the
most
balanced
of
them
all
thus
far
and
just
really
showcases
the
barrel
aging
the
best
of
them
all
as
well
just
amazing
just
wish
it
was
not
so
much
for
a
single
bottle
of
this
luckily
i
was
finally
able
to
try
it
due
to
it
being
on
sale
o
a
very
memorable
experience
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
cask
inspired
ales
ive
had
to
date
tons
of
scotch
flavours
amid
a
uniquely
flavoured
porter
certainly
a
great
celebratory
ale
and
even
more
so
for
my
30th
birthday
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
cask
conditioned
ales
and
i
can
understand
why
this
particular
offering
is
so
well
received
o
good
not
blown
away
by
this
but
it
was
interesting
has
tastes
of
black
cherries
oak
trappist
yeast
bay
leaves
almonds
and
spice
really
easy
drinking
and
may
possibly
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
definitely
the
best
from
all
the
special
res
so
far
imo
smells
like
rags
that
were
dipped
in
a
malt
liquor
than
dried
on
a
grill
with
burnt
chicken
and
peat
very
easy
to
drink
but
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
savored
and
cherished
slowly
o
overall
a
very
nicely
done
beer
a
lot
of
whiskey
flavoring
without
the
alchohol
burn
well
done
d
favourite
of
the
bunch
its
amazing
to
bad
its
not
cheaper
overall
this
was
such
a
treat
to
drink
this
was
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
i
have
smelt
the
only
thing
it
was
a
little
expensive
at
10
99
for
a
small
330ml
bottle
if
this
was
half
the
price
i
would
be
buying
it
all
the
time
this
was
probably
my
all
time
favorite
beer
i
just
loved
how
good
it
smelt
and
taste
amazing
od
lovely
well
balanced
and
complex
while
capturing
the
whiskey
element
and
rounding
it
out
with
other
good
flavours
outstanding
scotchy
little
more
to
be
said
its
complex
but
defies
adequate
description
in
human
languages
what
more
can
i
say
a
bit
expensive
for
a
12oz
but
a
good
sipper
went
well
with
a
banger
and
some
chips
o
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
barrel
aged
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
crafted
beers
that
i
have
tried
highly
recommended
while
the
mouth
feel
isnt
huge
its
certainly
adequate
for
this
beer
typically
i
expect
a
big
finish
on
roastysmoky
beers
of
this
type
but
ola
dubh
30
crosses
the
line
into
single
malt
territory
and
has
a
satisfying
finish
one
of
the
most
complex
and
wellbalanced
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
to
date
do
not
try
to
make
this
at
home
i
wish
it
were
as
simple
as
blending
highland
park
30
with
harveistoun
old
engine
oil
but
i
assure
you
its
not
the
barrel
this
beer
called
home
for
an
extended
period
had
its
previous
tenant
for
30
years
in
a
way
this
beer
was
in
the
works
well
over
a
decade
before
i
was
even
conceived
considering
the
results
id
say
its
worth
the
16
dollars
i
spent
on
it
and
the
other
16
i
spent
on
a
second
bottle
fuller
body
sticky
and
syrupy
nice
drinking
but
i
would
like
better
bal
aging
integration
and
some
more
interesting
flavors
ostrange
but
good
certainly
not
a
brew
you
are
going
drink
a
lot
of
or
all
that
often
but
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
very
interesting
unique
beer
doesnt
really
fit
any
style
this
was
actually
a
birthday
present
from
my
barber
glad
i
tried
it
and
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
but
not
something
i
would
return
to
cheers
this
bottles
a
little
over
two
years
old
and
i
cant
see
how
it
could
mellow
out
further
im
undecided
if
i
need
a
few
of
these
to
age
at
12bucks
a
bottle
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
who
am
i
kidding
if
this
beers
this
mellow
after
2
years
i
cant
imagine
it
on
its
bb
date
very
clean
little
residual
lingering
carbonation
is
rather
light
leaving
you
free
to
taste
the
beer
fully
at
8
no
warmth
no
bite
alcohol
is
fully
mellowed
out
wow
i
suppose
the
auld
in
this
ale
comes
from
the
time
spent
in
the
highland
casks
and
its
a
good
thing
the
nip
of
the
northern
islands
provide
a
nice
edge
to
this
big
malty
bastard
which
hides
its
booze
like
a
real
miser
d
this
was
a
gift
so
i
didnt
have
to
spend
any
money
on
it
at
the
same
time
i
know
that
its
about
16
a
bottle
i
dont
see
myself
ever
dropping
that
kind
of
coin
on
this
glad
to
have
tried
it
its
something
ive
always
wondered
about
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
or
cask
the
last
of
the
ola
dubhs
for
me
to
try
pours
an
opaque
brown
colour
with
creamy
tan
head
head
dissipates
down
to
a
very
thin
layer
leaving
traces
of
lacing
smells
of
oak
slight
peat
smoke
vanilla
chocolate
with
some
roasted
malt
flavour
really
pulls
together
all
the
smells
quite
a
sweet
aftertaste
very
smooth
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
thick
liquid
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
would
buy
more
of
these
if
it
werent
for
the
price
it
isnt
enough
better
than
the
ola
dubh
12
and
16
to
justify
the
price
difference
like
many
a
highpriced
brew
its
good
to
try
this
one
once
especially
if
one
is
comparing
it
to
the
12
16
18
and
40
but
probably
not
more
than
once
unless
its
gifted
to
me
then
by
all
means
ive
had
the
12
before
not
enough
to
warrant
a
review
but
enough
to
find
it
as
drinkable
and
complex
as
the
30
so
im
not
sure
the
older
barrels
are
doing
as
much
as
the
price
point
says
they
are
for
about
14
bucks
a
bottle
a
beer
better
be
damned
fantastic
the
30
was
merely
very
good
till
i
have
to
admit
the
peaty
scotch
notes
were
nice
and
the
brew
itself
was
worth
savoring
over
the
course
of
an
evening
just
like
i
would
with
a
dram
of
single
malt
whisky
overall
i
was
expecting
a
big
heavy
whiskey
bomb
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
whiskey
is
restrained
and
the
other
flavors
mesh
well
well
done
and
recommended
o
masterpiece
its
surprisingly
drinkable
the
abv
stays
constant
as
the
barrelaging
gets
older
so
the
flavours
get
bigger
but
the
extremeness
stays
put
d
much
smoother
than
the
18
but
overall
very
similar
its
ok
but
the
dryness
wears
on
me
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
black
with
the
tiniest
of
mocha
heads
and
a
few
legs
here
and
there
nose
is
really
nice
and
enjoyable
with
some
whisky
strong
chocolate
dark
fruits
molasses
vanilla
oak
and
roast
the
taste
is
nicer
than
the
special
reserve
40
as
there
is
a
bit
less
of
the
whiskybooze
feel
and
instead
you
get
down
to
the
oak
chocolate
and
vanilla
notes
good
feel
with
a
touch
of
booze
though
not
quite
as
warming
as
the
40
which
is
strange
to
say
about
a
beer
that
really
isnt
that
high
in
abv
d
glad
i
saved
this
beer
for
a
special
occasion
if
not
for
the
price
tag
i
could
certainly
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
hopefully
the
bigger
paycheck
will
mean
many
more
in
the
future
i
would
like
to
try
and
find
the
will
power
to
actually
hold
onto
one
for
more
then
a
couple
months
for
the
price
and
the
final
product
a
bit
of
a
letdown
especially
in
comparison
to
the
reserve
18
and
12
pretty
easy
drinking
considering
the
strength
of
it
but
still
too
shy
for
the
style
as
well
a
sad
pass
on
this
one
there
is
better
from
this
brewery
to
explore
and
discover
fuller
feel
swelling
of
flavors
vanilla
is
less
pronounced
in
the
30
drinkability
is
limited
more
by
price
than
anything
else
i
could
go
for
several
of
these
despite
the
8
abv
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
that
this
is
probably
one
of
those
that
is
best
in
smaller
quantities
not
sure
how
id
feel
about
drinking
the
entire
bottle
this
one
was
off
of
my
radar
screen
so
very
glad
get
exposed
to
this
one
and
give
it
a
try
f
some
sweetness
lingering
more
whisky
and
fruits
wood
esthers
a
little
dank
wooden
shelf
like
flavors
too
touch
of
roast
and
a
little
syrup
and
caramel
later
on
the
finish
comes
some
light
peat
and
smoke
a
definite
highland
park
scotch
flavor
d
very
good
beer
a
little
heavy
and
i
could
imagine
the
barrel
flavor
would
get
old
after
a
while
but
i
think
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
would
be
just
fine
drinkability
maybe
i
wasnt
as
blown
away
by
these
beers
as
i
should
have
been
i
think
its
possible
the
base
beers
were
just
on
the
whole
a
little
too
thin
a
little
too
flavorless
at
least
relatively
to
stand
up
to
what
a
period
of
time
in
these
various
and
sundry
barrels
would
do
to
them
im
not
sure
either
way
this
particular
brew
isnt
more
or
less
drinkable
than
its
counterparts
and
its
fairly
drinkable
relative
to
other
brews
of
its
stylethat
ive
reviewed
as
of
late
for
its
price
point
i
dont
imagine
myself
picking
this
up
in
the
future
so
again
many
thanks
to
my
friend
for
picking
this
up
for
me
but
i
can
imagine
it
being
more
up
certain
peoples
alley
and
definitely
worth
trying
once
to
some
smooth
low
carbonation
creamy
and
medium
to
full
bodied
there
is
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
but
it
is
not
too
much
a
very
nice
beer
which
i
would
gladly
buy
again
notes
bottle
21780
bottled
on
jan
2009
didnt
really
remind
me
of
an
old
ale
as
it
had
some
stout
like
flavors
and
a
lot
of
whiskybarrel
flavors
made
a
decent
sipping
beer
to
close
off
a
night
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
the
barrel
flavor
was
a
little
heavy
on
this
which
isnt
in
itself
a
bad
thing
but
it
covered
up
too
much
of
the
flavor
of
the
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
wont
get
it
again
especially
considering
the
price
overall
drinks
very
easily
smooth
and
refined
but
with
a
lot
of
maturity
in
its
subtlety
i
could
stand
it
to
be
a
bit
fuller
in
flavor
but
wont
complain
about
whats
there
goes
down
easily
and
makes
an
excellent
sipper
the
price
per
bottle
prohibits
me
from
keeping
it
around
but
i
would
consider
it
d
i
think
i
still
prefer
the
16
year
old
version
of
this
beer
but
this
whole
line
is
full
of
fantastic
beers
great
complexity
one
of
the
best
examples
of
barrel
aging
ive
ever
enjoyed
and
the
best
example
of
a
bottled
beer
really
making
me
think
of
cask
beer
fantastic
drinkability
runs
dangerously
high
with
this
beer
but
at
this
price
who
can
afford
to
drink
it
in
quantities
is
best
served
in
a
snifter
at
room
temp
and
would
be
a
good
night
cap
or
after
dinner
because
of
its
complexity
best
to
have
a
clean
palette
to
enjoy
all
of
the
complex
subtle
nuances
if
you
can
find
it
definitely
try
it
my
friend
today
tried
the
special
12
version
of
this
and
it
wasnt
as
deep
but
still
very
very
good
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
i
occasionally
chewed
rosemary
crackers
in
between
sips
the
combination
worked
well
for
me
would
i
have
ola
dubh
again
maybe
am
i
glad
i
tried
it
most
definitely
mmmm
nice
smokey
malt
flavors
really
fill
things
up
roasty
malts
with
burnt
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
a
bit
herbal
in
the
back
and
a
moderate
finish
carbonation
is
tingly
and
slightly
too
much
in
my
opinion
but
very
good
nonetheless
notes
amazingly
winelike
very
unusual
well
balanced
complex
flavors
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
however
at
13
to
14
price
tag
for
a
12
oz
bottle
i
think
ill
be
passing
on
this
one
from
now
on
all
in
all
this
was
a
bad
bitch
i
drank
this
with
a
buddy
in
the
car
while
chillin
at
sonic
best
sonic
trip
ever
now
i
just
gotta
try
to
find
the
special
reserve
40
excellent
beer
this
is
the
first
ive
had
in
the
reserve
series
to
judge
by
this
badboy
i
have
a
need
to
sample
the
others
this
is
quite
simply
a
wellmade
beer
like
any
ola
dubh
its
a
supercool
beer
and
way
too
easy
to
drink
maybe
not
quite
as
easy
to
drink
as
the
12
but
still
very
drinkable
for
something
like
this
in
fact
i
give
the
12
an
eversoslight
nod
overall
and
my
ratings
reflect
that
feels
great
on
the
mouth
good
carbonation
and
smooth
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
easily
out
of
the
three
that
i
have
tried
so
far
18
30
and
40
the
40
remains
my
favorite
on
cask
the
18
is
the
worst
imo
this
30
was
very
similar
to
the
40
but
i
still
like
the
40
better
just
a
few
more
and
ill
have
a
complete
set
thanks
churchkey
now
bring
on
the
12
and
the
16
would
like
to
lay
a
bottle
or
two
down
for
a
year
and
see
what
happens
drinkability
the
30yearold
barrel
adds
a
lot
more
complexity
than
the
16
and
12yearold
barrels
did
this
was
so
damn
complex
and
enjoyable
this
whole
series
12
16
30
was
complex
and
enjoyable
i
highly
recommend
these
beers
and
would
be
happy
to
try
any
of
them
again
o
great
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
would
love
to
share
this
with
friends
d
a
phenomenal
drinkability
the
blend
of
the
beer
and
barrel
are
practically
seamless
a
marriage
of
great
beer
and
wood
begs
for
repeated
tastes
i
am
eager
to
taste
the
other
versions
of
this
fine
barrel
aged
ale
this
is
a
really
well
done
beer
but
truly
a
nightcapsipper
even
a
12oz
bottle
would
be
a
real
stretch
for
the
most
ardent
of
drinkers
it
being
so
rich
and
luxurious
a
treat
for
sure
ola
dubh
40
huge
scotch
character
complimented
by
chocolate
and

smooth

4
65
drinkability
this
is
the
one
you
end
the
night
on
im
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
id
drink
it
again
if
the
chance
presents
itself
but
i
wont
go
on
a
quest
for
it
or
anything
d
pricey
but
outstanding
definitely
a
beer
to
end
the
night
with
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
luck
of
stumbling
upon
absolutely
incredible
was
it
worth
the
14
i
paid
per
bottle
no
doubt
this
was
drank
as
an
endofvacation
beer
and
man
did
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
few
more
also
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
content
on
this
one
its
thick
and
drinks
like
it
stunningly
highly
recommended
all
in
an
all
an
excellent
beer
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
nothing
special
here
nothing
to
justify
a
16
11
2
oz
bottle
anyway
i
dont
know
if
some
of
the
intensity
has
mellowed
over
the
2
years
since
its
bottling
2007
vintage
this
looked
the
same
as
the
12
16
and
18
year
ola
dubhs
it
smelled
quite
similar
to
the
16
and
18
years
chocolate
and
caramel
and
honey
wheat
and
roasted
coffee
i
expected
it
to
have
a
stronger
peat
and
oak
scent
due
to
the
greater
year
but
instead
it
remained
mellow
and
sweet
it
tasted
similar
to
the
other
ola
dubhs
also
roasted
barley
and
burnt
coffee
and
molasses
with
a
strong
oak
and
peat
finish
but
with
the
most
prominent
peat
character
of
any
year
along
with
salty
oak
it
had
a
similar
texture
to
the
other
years
but
with
a
strong
scotch
aftertaste
overall
this
had
the
most
depth
and
complexity
of
the
ola
dubhs
with
the
boldest
flavor
it
had
a
very
strong
sense
of
scotch
although
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
as
long
as
you
enjoy
the
flavor
of
scotch
age
is
clearly
a
friend
to
these
beers
and
this
one
could
go
much
longer
so
good
to
sip
fantastic
beer
i
love
beer
and
i
love
scotch
most
of
the
time
the
combination
is
awesome
except
for
that
brewdog
storm
yikes
this
is
representative
of
the
former
pours
black
with
brown
edges
shortlived
brown
head
slight
lacing
peat
and
chocolate
fill
the
nose
but
dont
overtake
the
caramel
and
cream
coffeeandchocolate
flavor
hits
you
first
but
the
slow
burn
of
the
scotch
is
right
there
lovely
centered
sweet
cream
and
toffee
finds
its
way
through
smoky
peaty
oaky
but
avoids
the
oilysoysauce
tang
that
some
of
the
younger
brews
had
a
welcome
saltysweet
finish
as
well
expensive
but
worth
it
pours
a
dark
brow
body
and
a
light
brown
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
smells
of
rubbing
alcohol
oak
nuttyness
coco
raw
vanilla
extract
tastes
very
very
mild
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
on
the
front
smooth
through
the
middle
then
a
kick
of
alcohol
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
buttery
smoth
and
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
just
awesome
very
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
good
retention
some
lacing
smoky
on
the
nose
with
molasses
brown
sugar
whisky
and
a
little
chocolate
the
palate
opens
up
with
a
lot
of
delicious
whisky
behind
which
theres
chocolate
nuts
smoke
and
peat
theres
a
slight
nutskin
like
astringency
that
i
like
finishes
dry
smoky
and
a
little
hot
a
definite
sipper
the
bartender
poured
this
beer
the
right
way
a
good
twothree
finger
head
dark
tan
in
color
with
a
dense
body
with
huge
head
retention
the
nose
had
a
big
aroma
of
a
very
nice
bourbon
the
taste
starts
with
a
dark
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
quickly
fades
into
a
big
juicy
dark
plums
and
black
cherry
fruit
mid
palate
the
finish
ends
with
a
smoky
sweet
caramel
note
wow
what
a
great
day
this
was
thanks
to
the
people
who
brewed
this
gem
drinkability
personally
i
would
have
another
because
of
the
simple
and
distinct
flavors
in
this
beer
but
my
colleague
give
this
a
lower
drinkability
drinkability
tough
but
great
dthis
just
didnt
interest
me
too
much
im
glad
i
only
bought
two
because
at
the
13
price
tag
i
would
have
been
very
upset
if
i
had
bought
more
mmmmmmm
hmmm
got
this
bottle
at
sams
in
chi
really
interesting
how
this
differs
from
the
12
16
opaque
like
the
16
more
aroma
and
going
on
than
the
16
but
not
as
coarse
the
12
isnt
coarse
at
all
relative
as
the
12
much
more
silky
divine
peaty
malty
roasty
in
the
nose
boozy
again
opulent
rich
and
sort
of
bitter
excellent
beer
not
a
session
tho
d
a
beautiful
drink
an
honest
slow
sipper
that
you
want
to
savor
and
appreiciate
extremely
smooth
in
character
and
drinks
bigger
then
its
advertised
8abv
a
rich
and
rewarding
experience
where
one
is
enough
to
fill
you
up
and
leave
you
satisfied
good
regards
here
this
has
to
be
the
most
flavorful
and
enticing
beer
ive
ever
drank
the
flavor
combinations
mixed
with
the
perfect
blend
of
smells
really
makes
this
beer
something
that
i
could
find
myself
craving
however
at
14
99
a
bottle
i
think
this
would
be
a
special
occasion
beer
and
definitely
not
one
you
buy
in
bulk
for
a
party
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
of
ola
dubh
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
had
this
on
cask
gravity
poured
at
the
brick
store
pub
ive
had
this
ontap
and
in
the
bottle
as
well
but
the
cask
version
is
far
and
away
the
best
version
pours
black
with
little
head
other
than
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
has
some
nice
whisky
in
it
and
smells
pure
and
balanced
with
subtantial
rounded
malt
but
dry
and
roasty
with
a
pleasant
grainy
smell
slightly
oaky
and
peaty
but
these
underscore
the
rest
rather
than
dominate
tastes
extremely
smooth
and
silky
like
chocolate
milk
laced
with
whisky
woody
treacly
dry
peaty
and
rounded
in
parts
sublimely
balanced
and
the
whisky
is
at
just
the
right
degree
of
mellowness
super
smooth
and
a
wonderful
wonderful
sipper
ok
but
not
too
easy
to
drink
another
one
maybe
this
one
was
getting
stale
d
pretty
good
i
prefer
this
one
to
the
16
this
one
is
a
little
smoother
while
the
smell
is
a
lot
rougher
still
not
gonna
buy
this
one
regularly
if
i
could
but
im
happy
i
got
to
try
it
both
the
12
and
the
30
are
great
beers
this
one
seemed
slightly
smoother
with
a
little
less
vanilla
recommended
taste
is
a
little
flat
cocoa
vanilla
a
little
smoke
some
nuts
and
slight
coffee
ends
on
the
dry
side
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
fantastic
gently
fluffy
subtle
exceptional
md
there
is
just
something
so
smooth
about
this
beer
the
viscosity
is
a
little
lower
than
i
would
like
but
thats
ok
because
its
made
up
for
in
the
overall
appeal
a
good
beer
that
i
dont
plan
on
revisiting
again
in
the
future
unless
more
carbonation
is
a
possibility
cask
is
probably
not
the
ideal
way
to
drink
this
beer
i
was
able
to
give
this
one
a
try
last
evening
on
cask
while
visiting
mahars
this
brew
was
probably
just
about
the
most
expensive
brew
i
have
had
but
a
real
treat
pulled
to
a
deep
black
color
like
looking
into
a
inkwell
the
head
color
was
a
medium
brown
with
pretty
good
retention
the
aroma
was
a
mixture
scotch
chocolate
smoky
and
slightly
burnt
malt
this
brew
really
had
a
potpourri
of
aromas
it
seemed
that
i
was
able
to
pick
up
different
properties
through
out
all
of
them
very
nice
the
flavors
are
also
very
nice
a
little
different
than
the
nose
as
some
flavors
showed
up
more
than
in
the
nose
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
was
the
whiskypermeated
barrels
really
gave
a
strong
scotch
presence
in
this
one
at
least
for
me
oak
flavor
comes
out
which
was
nice
good
accompanying
flavor
nice
smoky
flavor
not
over
bearing
at
the
tail
end
which
really
wrapped
this
one
up
nicely
the
malts
really
seemed
to
be
the
base
with
great
flavors
and
the
scotch
oak
and
smoky
flavors
really
adding
a
complexity
to
this
beer
that
i
have
never
had
before
wonder
if
this
one
would
be
as
good
in
the
bottle
or
if
the
cask
just
added
to
the
good
properties
d
when
i
drank
this
out
of
the
bottle
i
thought
to
myself
damn
i
wish
i
could
get
the
opportunity
to
try
this
on
cask
thanks
to
mahars
i
finally
got
the
opportunity
i
would
say
to
travel
through
the
night
for
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
on
cask
the
beer
was
an
opaque
dark
brown
on
the
pour
with
a
one
finger
brown
head
barely
any
light
shined
through
it
when
held
to
a
lamp
the
scotch
aroma
comes
off
deliciously
making
for
a
lovely
smell
akin
to
a
dram
of
whiskey
hints
of
oak
and
smoke
permeate
the
roasted
malt
and
whiskey
flavors
that
dominate
the
palate
the
finish
is
very
smoky
but
pleasant
mouth
feel
is
great
the
balance
of
carbonation
and
thickness
makes
for
a
very
creamy
brew
that
feels
great
as
it
warms
in
your
mouth
and
slides
down
your
throat
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
if
it
werent
for
its
lofty
price
id
enjoy
drinking
it
often
but
at
15
a
12oz
bottle
this
will
probably
be
a
one
time
tasting
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
in
color
the
really
nice
attribute
with
this
beer
is
the
smell
there
is
a
nice
robust
dark
peat
and
vanilla
taste
the
smell
is
very
nice
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
creamy
full
textured
and
plenty
going
on
in
the
taste
the
taste
is
nice
but
not
worth
the
priceimo
pours
a
near
black
color
with
the
littlest
of
little
heads
that
surprisingly
leaves
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
light
bitter
chocolate
with
a
mellow
scotch
scent
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
raisins
bitter
chocolate
peat
and
a
touch
of
honey
of
course
there
is
the
scotch
flavor
that
runs
throughout
not
as
strong
of
a
scotch
flavor
as
i
expected
but
this
is
quite
a
flavorful
old
ale
regardless
nice
progression
of
flavors
the
feel
is
heavy
for
an
old
ale
with
a
touch
more
carbonation
though
the
carbonation
is
fairly
soft
a
good
candidate
to
age
for
a
year
or
two
finishes
sticky
and
a
bit
bitter
very
very
good
brew
nice
subtle
scotch
flavors
drinkability
cant
drink
this
all
night
but
can
drink
it
every
night
great
medium
bodied
single
malt
backed
strong
ale
with
a
nice
finish
will
drink
again
and
tell
a
friend
notes
i
was
wondering
what
sort
of
differences
would
be
evident
when
comparing
my
previously
tasted
od
12
to
the
30
year
old
what
i
found
was
a
much
more
complex
bouquet
an
earthier
flavor
that
is
a
bigger
departure
from
the
originally
aged
beer
md
heavyfull
bodied
but
smooth
and
like
the
12
yr
way
to
easy
to
drink
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
and
a
very
dry
finish
i
could
have
had
many
more
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
hope
to
enjoy
again
but
i
prefer
the
12
yr
as
the
whisky
was
not
as
overpowering
my
expectations
were
met
with
a
complex
smooth
brew
pours
a
three
finger
brown
head
that
leaves
some
lace
black
no
highlights
molasseswhiskey
nose
light
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
flavor
is
smooth
molasses
and
whiskey
slight
burnt
coffee
finish
bottled
sep
2007
worth
trying
once
15
00
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
d
this
is
a
complex
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
the
finish
seems
to
linger
on
the
palate
indefinitely
and
it
continues
to
develop
character
all
the
while
i
have
compared
many
dark
complex
beers
to
good
cigars
but
this
reminds
me
more
of
pipe
tobacco
complex
smooth
mild
and
deeply
satisfying
drinkability
not
unpleasant
but
for
me
it
comes
up
a
bit
short
in
terms
of
both
body
and
flavor
the
only
really
stirring
part
of
the
ola
dubh
experience
is
the
jarring
price
tag
overall
very
interesting
vintage
and
excellent
brew
definitely
recommend
that
said
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
beauty
and
am
looking
forward
to
enjoying
it
after
a
bit
of
aging
had
this
on
tap
at
brick
store
in
decatur
and
was
lucky
enough
to
have
2
glasses
since
i
ended
up
liking
it
so
much
took
down
some
notes
for
review
both
pours
produced
a
thin
but
dense
tan
colored
head
this
beer
is
ink
black
i
was
surprised
probably
should
not
have
been
by
how
dark
this
beer
is
no
light
at
all
it
is
a
beautiful
beer
really
the
smell
is
also
intense
the
scotch
is
prominent
with
a
sweet
malty
background
i
must
admit
though
the
smell
is
almost
all
scotch
never
smelled
a
beer
like
that
before
smell
carries
through
to
the
taste
the
scotch
flavor
is
strong
but
in
a
good
way
as
it
does
not
end
up
too
bitter
the
scotch
adds
a
smoked
oak
aspect
to
the
beer
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
carbonization
for
the
style
i
thought
in
the
end
a
solid
and
drinkable
given
its
character
old
ale
this
was
a
wonderful
brew
and
one
im
sure
i
will
enjoy
again
i
got
bottle
06996sept
2007
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
ive
ever
laid
eyes
on
black
as
the
country
night
with
a
thin
hickorycolored
head
aromas
of
smokey
scotch
barrels
plums
and
chocolate
jump
out
at
me
its
a
low
carbonated
warming
brew
that
has
the
perfect
overtone
of
fine
scotch
whiskey
in
its
flavor
smokey
roasted
chocoalte
greatness
im
glad
my
uncle
gave
this
bottle
of
beer
to
me
because
i
probably
would
have
never
paid
11
99
for
it
its
close
to
perfect
tastes
very
good
big
wonderfully
complex
whiskey
woodiness
with
an
aftertaste
like
a
light
blended
scotch
somewhere
in
there
you
got
a
lightly
sweet
medium
fruity
aged
porter
taste
and
an
end
of
straightup
mesquite
nicely
balanced
i
would
have
liked
some
more
scotch
flavor
especially
after
having
the
16year
version
which
is
my
favorite
of
the
3
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
one
damn
good
beer
d
very
good
savory
beer
enjoy
it
like
fine
whiskey
slow
and
steady
ive
been
enjoying
my
boxed
beer
discoveries
as
well
as
beers
aged
in
a
variety
of
whiskey
barrels
so
i
was
excited
for
this
offering
however
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
i
was
anticipating
a
more
pronounced
scotch
flavor
that
just
never
came
together
a
highly
touted
beer
that
im
not
sure
is
worth
commanding
the
high
price
this
beer
isnt
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
budweiser
uses
the
word
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
the
8oz
i
was
served
was
more
than
enough
that
said
the
beer
does
go
down
pretty
easy
after
the
palate
warms
up
to
it
excellent
beer
all
around
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
brewed
and
aged
to
perfection
very
traditional
and
proper
yet
still
big
bold
and
rich
worth
every
penny
and
always
welcome
in
my
cellar
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
much
better
nicer
appearance
and
creamier
experience
pours
a
great
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
great
tan
head
and
nice
bit
of
lacing
it
has
a
wonderful
scent
part
coffee
part
whisky
part
malt
part
hop
a
near
perfectly
balanced
scent
that
ends
towards
the
scotch
side
wonderful
taste
the
whiskey
flavor
is
there
and
unfortunately
dominates
but
its
still
a
very
good
old
ale
nice
and
thick
with
deep
malt
and
burnt
flavors
it
goes
down
wonderfully
smooth
although
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
i
can
imagine
it
has
changed
signifigantly
i
have
has
the
12
and
16
year
old
versions
when
they
were
fresher
and
i
imagine
this
one
had
more
body
to
it
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
this
would
have
been
even
better
younger
dont
mistake
this
for
complaining
i
think
all
the
aging
did
was
thin
everything
out
well
worth
the
wait
though
the
other
two
i
thought
to
be
good
whereas
this
is
special
none
are
cheap
but
this
one
gets
into
the
scary
expensive
realm
considering
that
you
get
some
real
taste
of
a
fairly
rare
350
whisky
it
may
oddly
be
the
best
bargain
of
the
three
md
takes
a
lot
out
of
ya
a
thick
and
complex
sip
flavors
float
in
and
out
as
you
try
this
trying
to
get
them
all
takes
away
from
this
beer
just
drink
it
its
pretty
tasty
smooth
rolls
down
the
gullet
warming
too
strong
fro
some
a
strong
alcohol
bite
but
worth
it
the
best
of
the
three
drinkability
is
ok
a
tasty
beer
but
for
the
price
and
rarity
its
pretty
much
one
an
done
i
liked
it
more
then
the
16
a
little
sweeter
but
not
worth
double
the
price
im
sure
some
of
that
went
to
the
individual
boxes
and
stupid
medallion
perhaps
theres
subtlety
that
a
scotch
connoisseur
would
notice
that
i
didnt
but
i
rarely
drink
hard
alcohol
and
if
so
mostly
bourbon
still
i
highly
recommend
serving
them
all
at
once
as
a
vertical
tasting
bouncing
back
and
forth
to
pick
up
the
subtle
differences
of
aging
the
same
beer
in
barrels
that
held
the
same
spirit
but
for
different
lengths
of
time
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
carbonation
is
low
this
works
out
very
well
the
mouthfeel
of
the
body
is
silky
smooth
the
body
is
in
the
middle
of
the
full
bodied
category
i
wanted
to
treat
this
beer
as
a
sipper
i
really
wanted
to
take
my
time
a
savior
this
beer
i
am
distressed
at
my
lack
of
control
this
beer
is
really
something
special
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
small
ruby
highlights
damn
near
impenetrable
good
off
whitelight
tan
head
nose
is
peat
and
smoke
with
some
chocolate
a
touch
of
scotch
flavor
is
huge
with
roasted
peat
malt
some
smokiness
smoked
malt
defenite
peat
and
some
chocolate
notes
that
dance
across
the
palate
at
different
times
during
each
sip
slight
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
cherry
the
scotch
barrell
flavor
is
very
apparent
just
before
and
throught
he
finish
scotch
and
wood
are
clear
in
the
flavor
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
viscous
and
low
in
carbonation
in
a
good
way
drinkability
is
hampered
a
bit
by
the
huge
richness
here
but
is
quite
good
for
the
style
and
the
abv
great
scotch
flavor
here
without
the
great
sctoch
burn
overall
a
cherishable
brew
that
i
think
will
be
excellent
with
a
bit
of
age
a
truly
unique
brew
and
one
i
will
revisit
when
i
feel
like
a
rockstar
a
solid
well
crafted
old
ale
that
is
a
real
treat
when
one
can
afford
it
the
scot
in
my
lineage
smiles
with
each
sip
great
beer
d
not
one
you
would
pound
but
a
true
gem
for
when
you
want
to
sit
back
relax
as
you
watch
life
pass
by
d
will
definately
have
this
beer
again
its
so
elegant
and
sexy
i
might
just
age
a
bottle
a
year
or
so
but
18
bucks
for
12
oz
is
pretty
gnar
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
though
the
alcohol
is
certainly
there
its
modest
and
blends
well
with
the
other
flavours
an
excellent
evening
sipper
and
ill
need
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
some
more
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
i
love
all
the
old
engine
oil
and
ola
dubh
beers
this
one
is
just
exceptional
everyone
is
a
treat
though
this
one
blows
the
rest
away
imo
there
seems
to
be
much
more
complex
subtle
flavors
and
more
peaty
and
toffee
malt
which
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
scotch
whiskey
is
a
bit
more
prominent
in
this
one
than
in
the
16
year
edition
and
this
one
is
a
bit
more
complex
as
well
a
real
pleasure
to
sip
good
drinkability
in
a
sipping
context
especially
with
the
slight
dryness
when
compared
to
the
others
this
one
stings
the
wallet
a
bit
theyve
made
it
worth
it
though
i
like
this
one
the
best
of
the
three
figures
rounding
out
the
last
of
the
ola
dubh
special
reserve
series
is
the
30
year
bottled
september
2007
with
a
bottle
number
of
7220
i
have
to
say
that
the
12
month
tasted
better
this
one
is
like
the
others
in
a
lot
of
ways
the
color
a
nice
dark
ruby
to
almost
black
light
to
no
carbonation
to
be
seen
with
a
head
that
goes
away
quickly
the
scent
of
whiskyoak
is
there
but
is
actually
lighter
then
the
others
in
the
series
this
time
the
sweetness
seems
closer
to
raisins
then
the
other
with
molasses
you
can
taste
the
whisky
mostly
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
a
very
nice
beer
but
the
12
month
is
my
favorite
drinks
pretty
easy
but
the
dryness
complexity
will
hold
you
back
a
bit
i
liked
the
taste
of
the
12
better
but
this
one
rates
a
bit
higher
due
to
the
lovely
smell
drinkability
is
good
good
balance
but
a
touch
more
roasty
and
astringent
than
the
others
i
liked
the
fruit
and
smoothness
that
came
with
this
one
but
overall
would
pick
the
16
as
my
favourite
of
the
three
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
one
which
rewards
the
effort
a
luxurious
asserive
scotch
ale
that
has
a
rustic
oldworld
nature
along
with
a
finess
and
sophistication
that
cant
be
ignored
bottle
indicates
that
the
beer
was
bottled
nearly
a
year
ago
good
amount
of
age
under
its
belt
the
pour
brings
a
solid
stoutlike
color
dark
brown
and
basically
opaque
creamy
and
rich
the
beer
brings
a
12
creamy
head
formation
that
retains
quite
well
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
quite
stoutlike
as
well
with
medium
roasted
note
with
peaty
smokiness
grape
and
anise
esters
notes
of
currants
lactose
nuts
oak
and
rich
alcohols
emit
from
the
glass
flavors
begin
to
steer
away
from
the
roasty
stout
notes
but
begin
to
favor
nutty
coffees
red
grapes
plumbs
liquorice
toasted
malts
soy
sauce
dry
woodiness
scotch
whisky
cocoa
powder
melanoidinmeaty
similar
to
dopplebockes
and
a
mild
hit
of
sorgum
textures
are
rich
and
full
allowing
the
creamy
weeheavy
feel
to
dominate
but
also
bringing
a
dry
powdery
woody
astringecy
to
keep
the
sugars
for
commanding
the
drinkability
a
bit
schwarabierlike
finishes
with
a
campfire
scotchwoody
estery
blend
in
retrospect
the
smokey
nature
may
have
come
from
smoked
malts
the
flavors
are
too
clean
to
think
they
came
primarily
from
the
phenolic
yeasts
still
great
beer
maybe
the
best
scotch
ale
out
there
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
medium
bodied
nutty
earthy
pungent
fragrant
cigar
pours
an
opaque
black
with
dark
brown
and
red
highlights
medium
sized
thick
brown
head
forms
looks
like
tar
settles
to
a
thin
ring
quickly
drops
a
ton
of

this
stuff
is
dark
smell
is
nice
chocolate
and
toffee
whiskey
oak
dark
fruits
some
alcohol
figs
cherries
very
roasty
more
brown
sugar
in
this
one
that
the
previous
two
smells
a
little
sweeter
bit
more
oak
and
vanilla
than
the
12
but
i
didnt
feel
like
more
than
the
16
but
it
was
a
bit
fruitier
taste
is
charred
wood
bread
toffee
chocolate
whiskey
sherry
some
licorice
and
vanilla
not
as
rich
as
i
hoped
the
wood
came
through
in
the
30
more
a
bit
more
astringent
less
whiskey
or
at
least
smoother
and
better
integrated
more
roast
and
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
let
down
as
i
had
hoped
this
would
be
richer
than
the
16
but
it
wasnt
still
a
set
of
pretty
solid
beers
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
little
disappointed
especially
considering
the
price
on
these
thanks
for
grabbing
this
for
my
dyan
had
on
cask
at
coles
and
it
was
the
clear
winner
of
the
festival
big
whiskey
but
great
above
average
mouthfee
pours
an
opaque
darkness
with
a
shallow
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
the
smell
is
deep
and
rich
figgy
dark
fruit
cherryvanilla
oak
aged
character
and
a
distinct
sweetness
of
milk
chocolate
a
real
nice
complexity
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
silky
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
boozy
notes
from
the
barrels
full
flavored
the
taste
is
really
similar
to
the
nose
a
real
celebration
of
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
im
really
surprised
that
its
only
8
abv
way
too
easy
if
it
were
a
34
bucks
a
bottle
my
score
might
be
better
but
honestly
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
a
price
tag
that
claims
it
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
cheap
price
or
split
it
with
a
friend
the
strength
of
this
beer
is
not
so
much
the
barrelaging
but
the
old
ale
itself
id
love
to
try
the
old
ale
in
its
pure
state
before
it
even
hits
the
barrel
i
have
a
feeling
its
a
mindblower
the
other
strength
is
that
this
beer
will
impress
scotch
whisky
fans
lovers
of
barrelaged
beers
and
even
skeptics
who
generally
dont
go
for
this
sort
of
thing
different
enough
from
the
norm
that
it
easily
stands
out
and
actually
worth
the
high
price
if
the
mouthfeel
were
as
viscous
and
chewy
as
it
should
be
it
would
be
an
absolute
monster
if
you
are
have
access
to
this
beer
this
is
not
one
to
miss
d
i
really
didnt
taste
as
much
whisky
in
this
as
everyone
makes
it
out
to
contain
it
is
good
and
well
balanced
but
perhaps
a
bit
overated
in
my
opinion
this
was
pushing
the
border
towards
imperial
stout
and
i
wish
they
would
have
toned
back
the
roastiness
a
bit
and
let
the
old
ale
aspects
shine
through
more
the
30
yr
pours
an
shiny
oilinklike
black
color
with
a
small
brown
head
the
nose
is
rugged
yet
refined
and
mellow
roasted
malts
vanilla
sweetness
oak
mocha
and
coffee
beans
this
brew
really
attacks
your
palate
initially
but
by
the
3rd
sip
its
true
beauty
begins
to
shine
through
burnt
malts
and
coffee
really
stand
out
up
front
hints
of
corn
and
a
subtle
whiskey
note
combined
with
a
semisweet
vanilla
character
and
a
very
pleasant
heavy
cream
like
mouth
feel
followed
by
a
lingering
almost
sweet
coffee
bitterness
aftertaste
this
beer
begs
to
be
consumed
it
may
be
pricey
but
totally
worth
trying
if
spotted
on
tap
at
2
differnet
places
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
great
rhone
syrah
if
you
give
it
about
an
hour
or
2
in
the
glass
tough
as
the
temp
tends
to
not
be
right
when
you
enjoy
the
beer
wine
the
most
wine
like
beer
ive
ever
had
sensational
aroma
with
complexity
and
debth
that
has
to
be
tasted
expensive
as
can
be
yes
but
undoubitly
a
great
beer
i
have
a
bottle
that
ill
age
about
10
years
this
is
a
killer
beer
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
rich
and
complex
brew
with
a
heavy
weight
and
8
apv
the
smoothness
here
is
second
to
none
with
a
masterfully
composed
profile
and
a
lingering
flavor
that
leaves
the
palate
completely
satisfied
this
one
is
definitely
worth
twelve
dollars
a
bottle
cheers
poured

small

behind

very

very
drinkable
i
would
say
this
is
the
best
in
the
numbered
brews
highly
recommended
thanks
bill
recommended
as
an
after
dinner
drink
probably
in
the
56
oz
range
d
this
beer
has
a
good
depth
of
flavor
and
they
are
very
rich
flavors
the
barrel
compliments
the
beer
and
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
of
heat
to
really
finish
the
tasting
still
a
wonderful
beer
this
beer
was
a
real
disappointment
overall
especially
when
considering
its
15
95
price
tag
highly
overrated
in
my
opinion
i
paid
a
pricey
14
99
for
the
11
2
ounces
so
probably
not
something
youll
drink
on
a
daily
basis
but
a
nice
treat
that
takes
cask
aging
to
a
new
level

i
definitely
recommend
this
to
others
to
try
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
1517
a
bottle
i
forget
exactly
how
much
i
paid
for
this
id
drink
it
all
the
time
the
complexity
would
be
best
appreciated
by
someone
interested
in
analyzing
different
styles
i
think
all
but
the
most
enthusiastic
beer
lovers
would
find
this
a
challenging
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
smooth
strong
and
has
a
great
scotch
whiskey
flavor
but
there
are
two
drawbacks
to
its
drinkability
1
the
price
17
per
12
oz
bottle
ouch
and
2
at
8
abv
not
too
overpowering
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
overall
worth
the
try
skal
overall
very
good
and
on
par
with
the
16
but
with
a
smoother
and
more
even
profile
i
hear
that
they
are
going
to
branch
this
one
out
even
more
and
i
would
be
most
excited
to
see
what
other
varieties
they
can
come
up
with
the
price
tag
is
very
steep
but
think
this
one
is
worth
the
price
at
least
once
this
would
be
an
enjoyable
accompaniment
to
a
roaring
fire
and
a
fine
cigar
while
a
truly
wonderful
beer
and
must
drink
especially
on
cask
if
you
ever
find
it
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
couldnt
drink
much
more
than
the
6
oz
pour
i
received
at
spuyten
duyvil
its
just
too
rich
for
much
more
than
that
and
that
is
the
only
reason
the
drinkability
is
not
higher
but
wow
what
a
treat
bottle
courtesy
of
goryshkewych
poured
a
deep
pitchblack
color
ale
with
a
medium
light
brown
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
distinctive
notes
of
scotch
taste
is
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
with
some
notes
of
scotch
with
a
creamy
like
texture
the
chocolate
notes
of
the
regular
old
engine
oil
beer
are
still
present
full
creamy
body
with
some
good
carbonation
and
no
discernable
alcohol
i
would
say
that
this
was
good
but
i
would
have
expected
more
scotch
presence
and
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
a
staple
considering
the
price
tag
a
marvelously
big
and
drinkable
beer
due
perhaps
to
the
abv
being
relatively
low
on
tap
at
the
midlothian
capital
ale
house
in
va
only
9
50
for
a
good
goblet
pour
the
aromas
were
so
intense
the
aromas
were
strong
of
good
scotch
and
coffee
the
tast
was
almost
undescribable
this
is
the
perfect
balance
between
beer
and
actual
alcohol
all
of
the
great
aromas
and
tastes
from
the
best
scotches
with
the
drinkability
of
a
beer
meld
together
here
if
you
find
this
get
it
and
dont
look
back
the
whiskey
flavors
stay
mellow
and
subdued
but
never
leave
the
pallate
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
im
still
hyped
from
drinking
it
thanks
cah
for
getting
this
one
on
tap
somewhat
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
it
again
if
you
are
worried
about
budget
there
are
many
barreled
beers
far
more
complex
and
intriguing
for
less
money
if
you
arent
give
it
a
try
d
wow
this
was
really
great
and
out
of
a
cask
no
less
thanks
dave
definitely
couldve
done
more
than
1
glass
of
this
but
i
had
stuff
to
do
later
in
the
evening
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
d
this
was
decent
for
an
old
ale
though
a
bit
on
the
light
side
the
scotch
certainly
added
a
nice
complexity
to
it
i
originally
wanted
to
try
this
until
i
saw
twelve
ounce
bottles
for
around
eighteen
dollars
and
never
got
to
buying
one
gabe
said
this
was
the
most
expenisve
keg
he
has
ever
bought
hard
to
resist
yesterday
when
i
sae
this
on
the
board
first
beer
from
this
brewery
very
unqiue
probably
the
oldest
barrel
aged
beer
i
have
tasted
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
turned
out
to
be
even
better
would
like
to
try
again
recommended
d
a
tasty
barrel
aged
beer
in
the
end
though
i
think
i
expected
a
little
more
out
of
it
i
would
like
to
taste
the
other
incarnations
of
the
ola
dubh
brew
im
sure
glad
i
opted
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
the
ola
dubh
series
as
each
one
brought
something
different
to
the
table
and
were
very
enjoyable
the
only
thing
stopping
me
from
seeking
them
out
again
is
that
theyre
so
darn
expensive
d
damn
this
was
awesome
the
30
is
an
incredibly
masterful
example
of
cask
ageing
if
judged
solely
on
my
review
score
the
30
gets
the
edge
however
if
judged
on
price
the
12
is
the
clear
winner
this
is
one
case
where
you
should
defer
to
your
senses
and
not
your
wallet
oh
hell
just
buy
all
three
and
decide
for
your
self
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
thicker
than
the
12
and
16
but
it
still
isnt
rich
enough
to
make
it
a
world
class
beer
it
does
however
help
the
drinkability
i
love
the
woody
roasty
dry
finish
and
how
it
really
makes
you
yearn
for
the
next
sip
this
beer
poured
a
dark
motor
oil
color
with
very
little
tan
head
had
descent
lacing
present
the
aroma
was
of
smoke
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
a
nice
smokiness
almost
a
bbq
type
smoke
to
it
had
a
nice
hint
of
hops
as
well
the
body
was
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
with
almost
no
carbonation
great
beer
for
a
nice
cold
night
d
this
is
an
ultimate
after
dinner
drink
or
an
evening
substitute
for
something
harder
like
a
scotch
or
a
cognac
only
thing
i
thing
it
is
lacking
is
that
i
think
the
flavors
will
be
even
better
blended
with
some
more
age
on
the
bottle
i
liked
the
12
and
30
at
about
par
for
different
reasons
liked
the
woodiness
of
the
12
and
the
slightly
higher
carbonation
and
overall
fullness
in
body
of
the
30
better
than
the
16
because
the
sweetness
im
sticking
with
the
12
from
here
on
out
its
not
a
profound
difference
but
its
noticeable
deep
brown
color
practically
black
with
a
bigbubbled
collar
rich
aroma
of
chocolate
malts
and
bigtime
vanillas
the
wood
influence
here
is
pronounced
rich
coffee
notes
in
the
background
as
well
along
with
some
peat
and
a
touch
of
bandaid
on
the
palate
the
beer
surprisingly
light
with
nutty
malts
coming
through
first
alongside
a
winey
almost
sherried
note
mild
acidity
acts
on
the
tongue
throughout
along
with
some
firm
hop
bitterness
during
the
second
half
a
fruity
and
yeasty
element
pops
up
toward
the
end
great
length
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
less
body
than
the
12
year
old
but
some
gentler
wood
effects
overall
this
is
fantastic
stuff
great
wood
integration
a
bit
more
subtle
than
the
12
year
old
excellent
way
under
carbonation
but
still
very
very
tasty
the
individually
boxed
package
with
a
clinky
neck
ornament
exuded
pure
class
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
humble
mug
and
it
graced
it
with
a
pitch
black
appearance
and
a
two
finger
thick
beige
head
the
smell
was
more
typical
of
a
dry
stout
than
an
old
ale
it
smelled
pretty
roasty
with
a
lot
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
along
the
same
vein
but
the
whisky
barrel
aging
was
more
apparent
here
the
roasty
flavors
were
mellower
than
the
smell
suggested
and
there
were
overtones
of
vanilla
and
prunes
the
body
was
soft
and
oily
which
was
quite
appropriate
i
suppose
quite
good
but
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
the
time
i
sample
my
stouts
with
some
dark
chocolate
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
dwow
top
notch
beer
absolutely
delicious
note
the
only
reason
for
a
difference
in
score
for
me
between
cask
and
bottle
is
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
this
is
an
absolute
tour
de
force
by
harviestoun
ive
always
enjoyed
their
beers
but
this
is
clearly
taking
the
game
to
a
new
level
the
carbonation
is
pretty
low
which
adds
to
the
soft
plush
mouthfeel
we
served
it
at
cellar
temperature
and
i
absolutely
would
recommend
against
over
chilling
this
beer
it
was
perfect
at
the
temperature
we
had
it
at
very
very
impressive
final
evaluation
of
all
three
and
my
vote
goes
to
16
drinkability
i
have
to
say
that
this
was
one
great
tasting
experiment
to
have
been
a
part
of
while
it
may
seem
like
i
had
a
lot
of
bad
things
to
say
about
this
beer
i
would
say
that
it
was
the
most
drinkable
of
all
of
them
16
year
being
a
close
second
is
the
30
year
worth
all
that
money
i
would
say
yes
if
you
can
afford
it
if
you
cant
well
16
year
is
very
nice
as
well
12
is
good
if
you
dont
have
the
others
to
compare
it
to
it
was
unfair
to
12
to
have
it
against
its
older
barrel
brothers
i
would
also
like
to
have
the
same
tasting
with
old
engine
oil
and
old
engine
oil
reserve
malt
whiskey
cask
but
i
suppose
we
cant
have
it
all
now
can
we
great
beers
overall
na
zdravi
overall
very
mellow
old
ale
with
really
well
balanced
pleasant
flavors
the
abv
is
all
but
hidden
everything
in
here
is
wonderful
and
it
is
a
real
easy
drinker
definitely
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
o
hmph
ive
had
all
of
the
ola
dubh
brews
and
i
found
them
all
to
be
surprisingly
different
i
didnt
like
the
30
very
much
but
i
liked
the
18
the
12
was
a
little
too
mild
on
the
barrel
aging
this
one
is
pretty
damn
close
to
just
right
along
with
the
18
this
one
is
more
complex
though
nice
balance
of
flavors
too
really
nice
i
cant
recall
the
other
versions
of
this
well
so
i
cant
comment
on
how
this
varies
a
mild
body
and
unique
mix
of
caramel
and
scotch
notes
makes
this
very
exciting
awesome
old
ale
cant
wait
to
try
the
30
yr
bottle
number
49393
january
2009
poured
into
a
small
snifter
small
head
with
low
retention
as
expected
very
very
deep
mahogany
almost
black
body
aroma
is
a
mix
of
brandy
slight
alcohol
overripe
plums
dates
and
vanilla
taste
has
a
brandy
quality
tongue
coating
nice
old
fruit
and
slight
molasses
and
vanilla
wow
quite
a
journey
the
liquid
has
taken
to
get
into
the
glass
and
the
wait
was
worth
it
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
creamy
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
has
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruit
aftertaste
this
is
nicely
made
and
recommended
o
a
great
tasting
stout
that
screams
aged
in
a
whiskey
barrel
without
being
overdone
overall
i
was
hapy
to
give
this
a
try
but
would
be
hard
pressed
to
spend
20
on
an
11
2oz
bottle
again
i
will
be
trying
at
least
the
18
and
30
in
due
time
though
3
0
d
normally
id
give
this
a
3
5
out
of
general
good
will
but
i
cant
since
this
is
so
goddamn
expensive
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
has
plenty
of
flaws
and
the
mouthfeel
sucks
o
really
enjoyed
this
for
20
a
bottle
it
would
want
to
be
a
standout
but
i
wasnt
let
down
o
goodish
but
not
worth
the
price
jump
would
i
recommend
it
no
would
i
drink
it
again
if
offered
hell
yes
overall
this
one
was
great
not
good
but
great
the
taste
was
fantastic
smell
was
great
appearance
was
fantastic
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
noticeable
flaw
besides
that
though
this
was
definitely
a
beer
to
seek
out
even
with
the
very
high
price
think
i
paid
around
18
for
an
11
2oz
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
yet
more
incentive
to
finish
the
available
ones
worth
trying
for
sure
if
you
can
find
it
o
yummy
old
ale
here
whiskey
aging
narrowly
adds
another
dimension
falls
a
bit
short
of
being
elite
due
to
a
somewhat
lacking
mouthfeel
and
slightly
oxidized
taste
wondering
if
this
one
isnt
best
really
fresh
would
try
again
single
finger
head
with
some
scattered
lacing
on
a
jet
black
body
without
any
light
passing
through
smokey
and
confectioners
chocolate
sweetness
to
the
aroma
incredibably
smooth
chocolate
toffee
and
vanilla
flavor
nicely
complex
with
each
flavor
standing
out
moderate
carbonation
and
full
bodied
overall
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
for
its
genre
complex
and
memorable
an
excellent
beer
though
not
very
much
like
olde
ales
i
have
tried
d
lots
of
influence
from
the
barrel
but
the
caramel
and
chocolate
shine
through
there
is
a
but
more
sweetness
than
necessary
but
it
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
overall
while
im
sure
others
wont
agree
im
giving
this
a
perfect
55
this
was
amazing
while
i
have
not
had
this
brew
fresh
three
years
of
aging
has
done
something
incredible
to
this
beer
outstanding
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
my
highest
recommendation
expensive
though
a
quick
word
on
price
yes
this
can
be
silly
expensive
in
the
bottle
you
may
end
up
paying
over
20
for
it
is
it
that
much
better
than
the
12
year
which
i
rated
a
4
4
for
some
of
you
it
will
be
if
you
have
a
whiskeytooth
and
give
this
one
the
time
and
attention
it
deserves
its
worth
the
cash
d
another
great
lineup
in
the
ola
dubh
line
an
extremely
expensive
bottle
to
say
the
least
but
damn
enjoyable
i
still
think
the
edge
goes
to
the
30yr
overall
now
finally
having
every
one
in
this
lineup
deep
caramel
smell
coming
off
of
this
literally
took
me
by
surprise
nice
aroma
of
oak
and
alcohol
mixing
and
swirling
around
with
it
now
really
starting
to
pick
up
steam
the
warmer
it
got
warm
oak
infused
notes
of
brandy
like
alcohol
running
over
the
tongue
so
sweet
and
sugary
as
you
roll
it
around
you
start
to
notice
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
to
this
one
way
down
deep
under
all
of
the
malt
there
was
a
subtle
bitter
hoppiness
very
grainy
and
earthy
but
it
was
there
and
really
pushed
through
on
the
finish
long
drawn
out
finish
it
was
the
alcohol
was
so
well
blended
it
was
a
deadly
combination
soo
mellow
and
smooth
understated
it
lured
you
in
and
would
not
let
you
go
the
body
was
as
rich
and
smooth
as
the
flavordeep
dark
fruit
now
coming
through
for
me
really
started
to
actually
dominate
the
scene
all
together
huge
raisin
and
plum
notes
giving
it
that
sweet
but
yet
tart
dark
fruit
flavor
we
all
come
to
love
a
spicy
touch
in
the
back
perhaps
but
here
comes
that
little
bit
of
bitterness
to
wrap
it
all
up
near

it

an

good
tasting
beer
i
think
this
has
just
right
amount
of
smoke

it
is
definitely
there
but
not
overpowering
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
old

and
i
would
definitely
buy
another

of
it
o
i
just
love
the
complexity
of
this

and
what
it
has
to
offer
the

is
present
but
not
overpowering
as
a
fault
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
little
more
whiskey
in
the
flavour
after
trying
every
other
offering
in
the
series
i
wasnt
convinced
that
the
more
expensive
bottles
were
more
complex
beers
ola
dubh
40
was
the
first
20
beer
that
i
wondered
not
if
i
would
be
worthy
of
it
but
whether
it
would
be
worthy
of
me
turns
out
i
prefer
the
16
18
and
30
if
i
buy
another
ola
dubh
it
wont
be
this
one
o
overall
this
is
one
damn
tasty
brew
a
lovely
balance
of
beer
and
wood
with
just
a
touch
of
peat
in
it
delightful
there
should
be
no
surprise
that
this
is
just
a
world
class
beer
the
barrel
aging
texture
and
flavors
are
all
perfectly
balanced
which
makes
for
an
incredibly
enjoyable
drink
i
dont
know
if
i
like
this
or
the
30
better
both
amazing
and
highly
recommended
a
pleasure
to
sip
this
was
a
fun
brew
especially
for
a

such
as
myself

this
is
by
far
my

favourite
as
i
think
the
whiskey
really
does
overtake
the
nice
characteristics
that
this
brew
does
posess
and
its
a

me

my

with

quite
nice
frankly
the
closest
to
highland
park
40
that
i
am
likely
to
get
o
between
this
and
my
review
of
od
30
i
think
this
bottle
may
in
fact
be
compromised
the
flavors
are
so
lackluster
that
i
cant
help
but
feel
i
am
not
having
the
same
bottle
as
a
great
deal
of
reviewers
on
this
site
that
said
the
flavor
characters
remain
in
tact
but
they
are
just
so
mellow
and
twotone
yes
there
is
sweetness
and
yes
there
is
the
barrel
wood
but
dare
i
ask
where
is
the
flavor
fruits
make
appearances
like
apparitions
in
a
long
since
abandoned
home
and
i
would
like
nothing
more
than
than
to
revitalize
their
home
phantom
flavors
dont
belong
in
barrels
which
makes
me
believe
the
bottle
may
be
compromised
to
the
point
that
i
question
even
doing
this
review
however
considering
the
fact
that
i
have
reviewed
the
prior
beers
in
a
horizontal
i
feel
obligated
to
put
it
here
please
let
me
know
i
am
wrong
in
saying
this
beer
is
bringing
open
handedslaps
to
a
boxing
match
hit
me
with
flavor
dont
leave
me
wanting
o
this
one
actually
has
me
kind
of
shocked
im
not
sure
if
its
something
wrong
with
this
particular
bottle
but
this
was
not
really
an
enjoyable
drink
after
having
had
12
16
30
and
40
i
would
say
surprising
to
me
and
it
seems
contrary
to
most
reviewers
12
and
16
were
the
best
with
12
really
standing
out
to
me
12
was
something
in
the
realm
of
exceptional
worth
seeking
out
16
i
dont
remember
as
well
but
i
remember
thinking
it
was
in
the
ball
park
of
12
30
was
kind
of
a
disappointment
but
had
its
good
points
and
this
40
was
just
pretty
bad
again
not
sure
what
to
say
maybe
something
is
up
with
my
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
not
even
sure
if
i
want
to
finish
my
glass
yet
another
outstanding
offering
from
the
brewerys
special
reserve
series
jet
black
in
color
40
has
big
scotch
whiskey
notes
in
the
nose
and
initial
taste
complimented
by
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
with
a
vanilla
oakiness
at
the
finish
an
extremely
well
balanced
beer
40
is
as
rich
and
smooth
as
it
is
complex
and
i
believe
that
its
the
best
offering
in
the
series
pours
black
with
a
white
creamy
head
tastes
roasty
with
some
whiskey
notes
coming
through
the
finish
can
definately
pick
up
the
whiskey
notes
more
in
the
40
year
compared
to
the
12
and
16
insanely
drinkable
id
have
no
problem
drinking
a
lot
more
of
these
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
tag
delicious
beer
though
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
few
years
ago
now
ive
had
the
chance
of
having
it
again
and
it
still
kicks
ass
the
pour
is
a
great
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
ring
around
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
so
awesome
its
got
a
magical
sweet
smell
the
whiskey
wooden
smell
adds
to
it
its
hard
to
really
explain
but
its
great
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
with
a
whiskey
back
bone
there
is
some
vanilla
in
there
not
much
chocolate
but
a
little
bit
and
a
good
amount
of
smokiness
there
too
the
flavors
are
strong
and
very
pleasing
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
with
some
light
carbonation
the
overall
take
on
this
brew
is
just
really
good
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
its
very
pricey
for
what
it
is
extremely
drinkable
but
youd
better
like
scotch
if
not
this
could
be
tough
sledding
od
not
bad
a
little
too
oaky
for
me
but
it
was
still
a
good
beer
one
of
the
best
of
the
series
of
course
but
the
price
tag
is
rough
on
the
wallet
worth
a
shot
though
you
wont
be
disapointed
o
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
created
with
one
of
the
best
scotch
barrels
there
are
i
would
definitly
be
interested
to
compare
the
other
ola
dubh
releases
not
a
cheap
bottle
of
beer
though
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
a
great
thick
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
with
a
friend
its
wonderfully
complex
and
full
flavored
without
being
overbearing
ws
skål
this
is
my
least
liked
of
the
series
yet
id
be
willing
to
try
this
again
but
will
not
actively
seek
it
out
notes
carbonation
is
a
little
low
i
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
effervescence
a
sweet
desert
like
beer
that
would
be
great
as
a
digestif
no
hop
characters
are
left
and
the
beer
is
full
of
whisky
notes
it
was
difficult
to
spend
the
price
they
were
asking
for
this
is
probably
the
most
expensive
bottle
of
beerin
terms
of
oz
that
i
bought
at
retail
but
it
is
worth
trying
its
not
as
amazing
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
still
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
will
remember
for
a
long
time
now
that
the
bottle
is
empty
there
is
no
sediment
indicating
that
this
beer
was
filtered
i
doubt
that
this
beer
would
improve
any
more
with
age
a
fine
aged
sipping
beer
the
alcohol
taste
and
the
high
price
tag
makes
me
question
whether
i
would
seek
this
out
again
d
very
smooth
flavor
wise
nice
sense
of
dark
roasted
malt
but
the
scotch
soaked
cask
notes
were
a
bit
much
i
like
some
cask
presence
but
the
scotch
notes
were
to
a
point
where
it
overtook
the
general
character
of
the
beer
which
i
could
of
achieved
by
grabbing
some
cheap
scotch
and
watered
it
down
a
slow
moderate
sipper
at
room
temp
the
lesser
16
came
off
much
better
and
would
recommend
that
instead

oak
light
vanilla
dark

roasted

a
bit

the
taste
is
a
bit
overly
boozy

still
quite
nice
with
a
lot
of
whisky
and
chocolate
the
booze
fits
well
in
the
feel
as
its
interspersed
throughout
and
finishes
nicely
drinks
well
nice
sipper
since
the
alcohol
wasnt
as
overpowering
as
it
is
in
some
other
barrel
aged
beers
i
thought
this
was
fairly
drinkable
it
is
slightly
hot
and
therefore
a
sipping
beer
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
over
about
a
45
minute
time
frame
the
price
obviously
limits
this
from
being
a
beer
youd
want
to
consume
multiple
bottles
of
in
one
sitting
but
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
to
sit
down
with
on
a
cool
fall
evening
im
in
love
with
it
im
so
glad
i
had
this
d
a
fantastic
beer
it
has
a
level
of
complexity
usually
only
found
in
a
few
belgians
or
a
rich
red
wine
its
certainly
worth
trying
but
at
the
price
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
it
again
for
a
while

unlike
anything
ive
ever
drank
i
knew
that
this
beer
was
aged
in
barrels
used
for
maturation
of
single
malt
40
years
whisky
however
i
could
not
imagine
that
the
notes
of
whiskey
would
be
so
present
and
very
well
placed
giving
a
complexity
to
this
different
and
sensational
beer

seems

and
porto
and
especially
whiskey
and
oak
wood
low
carbonation
and
long

and
coffee
i
recommend
to
everyone
pours
a
great
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
great
tan
head
and
nice
bit
of
lacing
it
has
a
wonderful
scent
part
coffee
part
whisky
part
malt
part
hop
with
just
a
bit
too
much
of
the
scent
tending
towards
the
scotch
side
wonderful
taste
the
whiskey
flavor
is
very
much
there
and
unfortunately
dominates
even
more
so
than
the
other
aged
versions
still
has
some
nice
dark
roasted
malt
attributes
though
and
it
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
that
its
so
whisky
flavored
it
goes
down
fairly
smooth
exceptionally
for
an
aged
beer
d
im
glad
i
split
this
bottle
because
i
did
not
dig
the
huge
whiskey
tastes
no
way
i
could
enjoy
a
whole
bottle
of
this
to
the
head
i
really
enjoyed
the
lighter
versions
of
this
12
16
but
this
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
perhaps
a
few
years
of
aging
will
tone
down
the
whisk
but
thats
what
this
beer
is
all
about
so
ill
just
pass
this
one
on
the
shelves
forever
now
no
need
for
a
redo
d
thanks
again
liam
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
would
be
interesting
to
compare
the
other
years
against
it
but
that
would
require
a
good
liver
d
this
is
a
whiskey
bomb
but
if
you
like
deep
complex
whiskey
flavor
this
is
a
brew
for
you
i
find
its
depth
a
bit
of
a
handful
and
i
love
my
spirits
very
balanced
great
d
a
sipper
for
suresomething
to
sit
back
with
for
a
couple
hours
much
more
like
a
scotch
a
lovely
union
of
ale
and
whisky
making
expertise
eminently
enjoyable
and
drinkable
for
every
reason
but
the
price
18
canuckbucks
and
in
ontario
only
for
that
matter
that
said
it
was
difficult
to
ignore
this
offering
given
that
i
recently
finished
the
12
and
18
year
old
highland
park
malt
whiskies
and
trying
the
40
year
old
by
proxy
i
just
couldnt
say
no
like
the
fine
whiskies
worth
trying
once
for
the
extravagance
alone
i
absolutely
loved
the
12
this
one
is
a
little
overthetop
not
as
balanced
its
more
of
an
american
extreme
brew
than
an
english
old
ale
very
dark
nearly
black
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
visible
edges
it
had
a
thick
tanbrown
cap
of
very
fine
bubbles
good
head
retention
with
sticky
spotty
lacing
great
aroma
lots
of
whisky
character
when
the
bottle
was
opened
more
of
a
refined
alcohol
that
you
get
from
a
good
scotch
rather
than
a
boozy
nose
notes
of
caramel
and
vanilla
lots
of
malt
a
hints
of
chocolate
and
smoke
plus
a
bit
of
oak
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
whisky
light
vanilla
and
woodiness
there
was
a
bit
of
wood
tannin
dryness
and
booze
but
it
stayed
refined
and
pleasant
throughout
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
made
of
up
fine
bubbles
mild
warmth
and
a
tingle
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
nice
texture
i
quite
enjoyed
this
the
marriage
of
beer
and
whisky
really
worked
done
bottle
is
enough
for
me
given
the
price
and
the
fact
that
i
dont
think
i
could
have
another
one
although
it
was
quite
an
experience

some

a

and
a
toasted
flaked

finish
very
dry
and
chalky
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
more
vinous
and
fruity
but
its
not
as
bold
flavourful
or
complex
as
i
expected
i
let
it
sit
for
45
minutes
before
drinking
so
the
temperature
cant
be
a
problem
mouthfeel
is
velvety
slick
oily
parched
and
oaky
aftertaste
a
tad
boozy
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
ale
with
most
of
the
technical
elements
that
define
the
style
yet
the
taste
underwhelms
and
i
dont
love
it
like
i
thought
i
would
while
the
price
on
this
beer
is
exceptional
and
i
am
not
entirely
convinced
it
warrants
it
this
is
a
truly
remarkable
beer
very
complex
yet
simply
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
hiding
its
alcohol
well
the
barrel
is
very
dominant
but
seems
to
work
pretty
well
not
sure
its
my
favourite
of
the
ola
dubhs
but
its
a
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
low
to
medium
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
really
nice
scotch
flavours
in
this
one
d
seeing
as
this
is
meant
to
be
a
one
and
done
it
is
incredible
i
am
only
getting
into
it
but
i
will
want
more
when
i
am
done
too
bad
it
is
so
expensive
i
might
still
pick
up
a
couple
more
for
the
cellar
overall
better
than
the
18
year
however
it
is
not
like
beer
but
more
of
a
whiskey
fairly
drinkable
for
what
it
is

deep

also
dominated
by
loads

with
some

the
malt
body
is
quite
full
with
a
creamy
texture
and
some
good
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
and
would
buy
some
again
even
with
the
steep
price
tag
mediumfull
bodied
with
low
carbonation
it
has
a
slick
viscuous
mouthfeel
appropriate
for
something
whose
name
means
black
oil
with
its
dense
layered
flavour
and
9
abv
this
one
is
definately
a
sipper
its
also
a
sipper
that
leaves
you
in
anticipation
of
each
mouthful
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
your
glass
its
almost
too
easy
to
sip
on
it
faster
than
would
be
sensible

drinkability
moderate
at
best
the
extreme
smokey
and
meatiness
really
isnt
my
thing
not
that
i
dont
mind
smoke
as
an
aspect
to
a
beer
but
i
feel
its
a
bit
overdone
here
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
at
18
a
bottle
and
at
8
drinking
too
much
would
certainly
be
out
of
the
question
for
me
i
had
the
ola
dubh
12
earlier
today
and
while
they
are
fairly
similar
i
prefer
this
one
due
to
the
extra
flavour
from
the
scotch
d
the
taste
makes
this
entirely
drinkable
and
at
a
relatively
low
8
could
definately
do
more
than
a
few
d
i
liked
the
30
on
cask
a
little
more
this
beer
is
a
whiskey
lovers
dream
a
really
awesome
beer
that
i
was
lucky
to
be
able
to
try
on
cask
thick
substantial
mouthfeel
very
rich
and
smooth
and
a
nice
dry
finish
to
it
drinkable
even
with
the
8
abv
the
little
medallion
with
the
mouse
is
pretty
awesome
too
drinkability
is
definitely
higher
than
it
should
be
it
is
delicious
and
goes
down
quite
smoothly
cheers
great
to
drink

i
do

this
one
has
more
heat
than
i
wouldve
thought
id
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
though
can
you
imagine
the
rent
required
for
the
floorspace
of
a
40
year
old
barrel
omg
how
does
that
fit
any
business
model
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
it
highly
recommended
pours

the
scotch
whisky
aromas
are
pretty
strong
in
this
brew
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
all
scotch
and
malt
and
as
far
as
im
concerned
thats
a
good
thing
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
it
has
lowmoderate
carbonation
and
its
a
little

coating
although
it
does
seem
a
bit
thin
at
times
drinkability
is
very
good
its
smooth
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
then
i
like
malty
beers
and
scotch
that
and
i
liked
the
other
ola
dubh
beers
ive
tried
this
beer
isnt
cheap
at
all
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
well
no
not
for
18
40
i
could
get
three
ola
dubh
12s
for
less
than
that
and
id
enjoy
them
just
a
little
bit
more
really
i
understand
and
appreciate
why
this
costs
as
much
as
it
does
i
just
dont
think
theres
enough
of
a
payoff
in
the
flavor
to
warrant
spending
that
much
potent
whisky
sharpness
shows
on
this
one
it
has
a
dark
malty
lightly
smoked
character
along
with
the
woodwhisky
barrel
character
very
nice
though
not
worth
the
20
an
11
2
oz
bottle
for
this
one
imo
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
damn
drinkable
beer
after
a
weekend
of
ipas
this
is
refreshing
on
the
palate
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
black
and
opaque
in
the
snifter
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
disc
aromas
of
baking
chocolate
smoke
and
peat
are
most
prominent
theres
a
hint
of
heat
from
the
scotch
barrel
the
taste
closely
resembles
the
aroma
with
baking
chocolate
and
smoke
up
front
followed
by
subtle
peat
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
and
dry
the
barrel
character
is
wellintegrated
but
quite
dominant
a
bolder
base
beer
may
have
been
better
suited
for
scotch
barrels
good
stuff
all
the
same
the
kings
of
hops
this
beer
in
insanely
smooth
some
woody
notes
in
the

really
sweet

almost
nothing
in
the
back
medium

great

really
high
no

beautifully
balanced

overall
a
fantastic

probably
one
of
my
favorites
poured
a
dark

color
with
a
small
sized
tan

aromas
of
whisky
chocolate
some
earthiness
roast

tastes
of
whisky
more
than
the
aromas
vanilla
smoke

and
some
dark
fruits
light
alcohol
in
the
finish
drinkability
i
wish
it
werent
only
available
in
a
cask
and
so
rare
because
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
not
my
favorite
of
the
ola
dubh
series
pours
a
dark
stout
body
dark
brown
not
yet
black
head
is
nice
and
bubble
and
light
brown
smells
of
smooth
oak
and
raisens
and
coco
taste
smooth
buttery
front
with
not
much
in
the
middle
then
a
oak
barrel
and
alcohol
finish
very
very
smooth
at
times
it
seems
almost
flavorless
great
balance
moth
feel
is
oily
slick
a
little
foamy
the
drinkability
is
insane
so
smooth
so
balanced
amazing
this
brew
pours
black
as
night
looked
more
stout
than
old
ale
w
a
thin
tan
head
beautiful
lacing
that
continued
to
hang
on
the
glass
throughout
the
sampling
the
nose
on
this
one
was
of
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
espresso
beans
up
front
w
oak
light
scotch
and
vanilla
pipe
tobacco
in
the
background
taste
was
pretty
much
on
point
w
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
burnt
toffee
woodiness
and
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
on
the
finish
medium
bodied
kinda
slick
on
the
tongue
and
leaves
dry
and
clean
this
was
an
enjoyable
offering
but
this
is
more
scotch
than
beer
in
my
opinion
which
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
definate
sipper
not
that
it
matters
to
the
review
but
this
one
is
extremely
pricey
19
9911
2oz
bottle
overall
not
amazing
but
nice
and
would
sample
again
anytime
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
the
other
ola
dubh
brews
to
compare
them
against
this
one
if
youre
a
scotch
whiskey
lover
this
is
worth
trying
for
sure
like
the
ola
dubh
30
this
one
is
dark
brown
with
a
dark
brown
head
retention
is
poorer
but
this
still
is
a
good
looking
beer
again
the
nose
is
smoky
peaty
chocolatey
but
smoother
milder
and
a
little
more
delicate
the
peat
is
a
little
bit
more
and
the
smoke
a
little
less
excellent
stuff
not
very
boozy
and
the
whisky
notes
are
incredible
on
the
palate
the
nose
is
replicated
opening
up
with
the
whisky
along
with
a
mild
licorice
brown
sugar
nuttiness
finishing
rather
dry
and
smoky
with
some
whiskey
this
beer
is
a
treat
excellent
stuff
had
this
on
cask
gravity
poured
at
the
brick
store
pub
im
a
great
lover
of
whisky
or
whiskey
laced
beers
at
least
via
the
barrel
and
this
one
is
no
exception
superb
and
my
favorits
of
the
series
after
the
30
year
cask
pours
black
with
no
head
but
no
worries
here
smells
of
peat
the
barrel
and
whisky
very
smooth
and
balanced
and
not
in
the
least
bit
hot
compared
to
say
the
18
which
was
quite
so
the
taste
is
beautifully
balanced
with
lots
of
restrained
whiskey
character
briny
smooth
peaty
malty
and
simply
whiskyish
wonderful
ultra
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
deliciously
drinkable
30
on
cask
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
still
a
gem
several
of
my
favorite
barrelaged
beers
are
scotch
aged
and
this
one
reinforces
that
streak
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
especially
the
taste
which
was
very
well
balanced
given
the
barrel
aging
very
tasty
the
run
of
casks
leading
up
to
the
ola
dubh
40
yr
at
the
brick
has
been
fun
40
yr
was
certainly
an
exciting
pour
looks
very
similar
to
the
30
yr
in
that
it
is
an
ink
black
this
one
has
little
to
almost
no
head
though
very
low
carbonization
as
well
it
really
looks
like
ink
really
the
whiskey
smell
is
apparent
with
some
sweet
malt
hints
a
very
warming
feeling
as
soon
as
it
hits
your
mouth
the
whiskey
is
once
again
significantly
present
there
is
some
maybe
caramel
sweetness
in
the
background
that
provides
an
interesting
dynamic
to
the
whiskey
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
to
start
off
my
evening
at
the
brick
but
the
strength
of
it
and
the
whiskey
makes
it
more
of
a
beer
that
stands
on
it
own
definitely
a
distinct
and
delicious
flavor
overall
this
is
one
of
those
sam
adamscalagione
extreme
beers
that
pushes
the
limits
of
what
beer
can
be
the
whiskey
flavors
are
as
intense
as
any
beer
ive
had
but
it
still
manages
not
to
go
too
far
over
the
threshold
be
sure
to
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
can
gravity
pour
from
a
40l
steel
cask
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
pitch
black
almost
completely
opaque
with
a
small
one
finger
head
that
immediately
recedes
smells
mostly
of
whisky
with
some
burnt
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
first
sip
is
tangy
with
a
rush
of
whisky
being
by
far
the
most
dominate
flavor
there
is
chocolate
and
a
tad
of
coffee
along
with
some
burnt
malts
and
dark
fruits
all
a
supporting
role
as
it
warms
some
vanilla
and
smoke
appear
adding
to
the
beers
complexity
there
is
absolutely
no
carbonation
present
and
the
beer
is
fairly
light
bodied
i
sipped
this
in
a
vertical
of
old
engine
oil
12
year
30
year
and
a
shot
of
12
year
old
single
malt
highland
park
whisky
the
difference
between
the
30
and
the
40
year
versions
were
minuet
very
interesting
beer
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
is
evident
in
the
nose
but
not
overly
so
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
taste
reminded
me
of
the
sweetness
found
in
dark
bread
the
finish
was
complex
with
cabernet
notes
might
have
had
a
second
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
16
us
and
this
isnt
a
style
of
beer
i
usually
drink
a
nice
beer
though
im
not
sure
its
any
better
then
the
30
unless
they
were
priced
similarly
i
would
probably
always
get
the
30
d
def
a
sipper
stands
up
to
any
whiskey
barrel
ale
ive
had
before
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
i
would
highly
recommend
o
i
feel
honored
to
get
to
try
one
of
these
beauties
a
definite
share
beer
according
to
the
label
it
was
bottled
in
2011
poured
a
nice
inky
black
but
with
very
little
head
the
taste
was
exceptional
and
smooth
with
the
scotch
present
the
whole
time
but
never
overpowering
though
the
head
was
slight
it
did
lace
the
glass
nicely
as
i
drank
it
overall
a
wonderful
experience
o
stunner
admittedly
i
have
had
no
other
version
of
ola
dubh
nor
have
i
had
it
fresh
but
that
aside
as
a
standalone
experience
this
was
elegance
defined
an
11
or
12
bottle
well
worth
every
penny
highly
recommended
as
is
normal
i
guess
somewhere
between
16
and
30
great
scotch
barrel
notes
as
usual
nice
rich
dark
ale
underneath
these
ola
dubhs
are
well
worth
the
expense
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
given
the
price
but
its
more
than
worth
it
to
give
it
a
go
once
enjoyable
but
i
think
the
16
year
barrels
tickle
my
delicates
more
so
caviar
serving
type
bottle
based
on
the
reviews
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
one
very
underwhelming
almost
tastes
flat
with
some
bandaid
smokiness
at
least
you
can
pick
up
the
barrel
characteristic
only
thing
this
had
going
for
it
overall
drinkability
what
an
amazing
beer
rich
in
flavor
and
aroma
and
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
pricey
but
worth
the
experience
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
a
good
slow
sipping
and
savoring
beer
but
i
really
wish
i
had
more
i
will
have
to
check
out
the
rest
of
the
line
and
see
if
i
can
save
up
for
another
bottle
as
a
special
occasion
beer
o
these
ola
dubh
are
some
of
the
best
and
right
down
tastiest
beers
ive
come
across
the
highland
park
barrels
and
this
beer
recipe
were
almost
meant
for
one
another
laying
out
a
truly
phenomenal
experience
in
a
bottle
hats
off
to
harviestoun
and
even
to
highland
park
for
such
a
treat
with
the
18
and
all
the
other
ola
dubh
bottlings
black
thin
body
with
a
small
fast
dissipating
head
aroma
is
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
scotch
more
it
sits
the
more
it
smells
like
a
glass
of
scotch
light
mouthfeel
lots
of
flavor
though
lots
of
scotch
whiskey
comes
through
hints
of
chocolate
excellent
beer
definitely
a
great
beer
the
look
was
just
what
i
hoped
for
dark
and
refined
it
smelled
almost
like
an
actual
cask
the
first
taste
was
phenomenal
once
i
took
that
second
taste
and
let
my
taste
buds
explore
boom
great
to
the
last
drop
idk
how
much
other
people
have
paid
but
here
in
hawaii
it
was
13
99
to
me
totally
worth
it
ok
but
not
the
quality
expected
from
an
ale
this
pampered
the
general
whiskey
aroma
and
flavor
were
ok
but
since
the
aging
takes
place
in
scotch
whisky
barrels
i
expected
more
of
the
scotch
to
come
through
mf
mediumlight
body
medium
dry
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
palate
no
head
but
carbonation
creates
that
bite
smooth
but
thin
with
some
warming
qualities
3
25
d
enjoyable
but
not
terribly
different
than
other
beers
from
this
series
i
enjoyed
the
33cl
bottle
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
at
this
price
point
still
a
good
example
of
successfully
integrating
scotch
and
beer
o
i
dont
know
all
of
these
ola
dubhs
are
similar
in
memory
this
one
has
the
most
intense
smell
of
the
ones
ive
had
that
translated
to
the
first
few
sips
being
superb
but
it
didnt
quite
open
up
and
develop
like
id
hoped
still
a
fantastic
dark
brew
o
the
whole
time
i
was
saying
my
weakas
in
fairly
young
and
still
learning
pallette
would
appreciate
this
beer
more
in
5
years
when
i
can
really
enjoy
this
thats
how
good
this
beer
was
even
for
me
i
found
it
simply
masterfull
everything
balanced
and
nothing
harsh
great
barrel
blend
excellent
base
and
smoother
than
a
babys
bottom
well
worth
the
price
tag
and
my
fatherinlaws
friend
felt
the
same
way
seek
this
out
simply
world
class
with
almost
everything
else
looking
up
at
it
viscous
oily
and
warming
beer
taste
of
coffee
complex
aftertaste
tobacco
whisky
wet
wood
carbonation
is
low
mindblowing
old
ale
overall
just
a
fantastic
beer
especially
for
those
who
like
scotch
and
sweeter
beer
offerings
that
lean
towards
the
port
wine
side
of
things
that
said
its
classification
as
an
old
ale
is
curious
to
me
especially
since
the
base
beer
is
a
porter
perhaps
its
simply
one
of
those
beers
that
truly
defies
classification
either
way
its
delicious
o
harviestoun
doing
what
they
do
best
well
made
traditional
ba
dark
ales
would
love
to
do
a
121618
comparison
i
really
do
not
know
how
tho
stands
up
in
that
regard
tho
certainly
not
way
above
o
really
great
this
beer
is
solidly
outstanding
and
will
be
greatly
appreciated
by
whiskey
lovers
whoa
another
masterpiece
in
this
line
love
it
thick
sultry
and
luscious
love
it
thick
sultry
and
luscious
body
is
a
touch
on
the
soft
side
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
fits
perfectly
here
the
tinges
of
whisky
and
peat
meld
seamlessly
with
the
palate
and
other
dark
flavors
in
spite
of
its
richness
could
see
having
another
finish
is
much
easier
and
cleaner
than
i
expected
sumptuous
beer
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
english
style
old
ale
not
my
favorite
ba
beer
ive
ever
had
but
there
are
some
good
flavors
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
thicker
though
picked
this
up
at
a
great
little
beer
store
in
arlon
belgium
miorge
mihoublon
an
aggressive
pour
yields
a
deep
dark
brown
nearly
black
body
with
a
quickly
fading
caramelcolored
one
finger
head
with
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
malt
forward
initially
with
hints
of
caramel
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
mocha
as
it
warms
subtle
hints
of
smokey
peat
emerge
the
taste
is
much
more
peaty
right
from
the
start
also
getting
hints
of
espresso
mocha
caramel
dark
fruit
cola
molasses
and
prunes
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
for
the
style
with
light
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
sweet
finish
overall
this
was
kind
of
disappointing
it
wasnt
as
flavorful
as
i
had
expected
and
the
peat
was
too
overpowering
for
my
taste
superior
beer
tons
of
flavors
for
pure
pleasure
a
highly
recommended
classic
oh
so
rounded
and
oh
so
tasty
another
great
example
of
how
some
beers
can
benefit
so
greatly
from
barrel
aging
30
is
next
the
ale
really
hits
home
with
the
signature
flavors
that
the
weeish
of
heavies
exude
its
a
tremendous
beer
with
impeccable
balance
and
an
arsenal
of
complexity
that
changes
dramatically
as
the
palate
acclimates
to
its
power
and
as
the
ale
releases
secret
after
secret
as
it
warms
o
interesting
lots
of
scotch
in
this
one
really
cranking
it
up
compared
to
the
12
year
version
the
12
was
very
mellow
this
one
is
a
lot
more
barrelforward
stronger
flavors
in
this
one
as
a
result
has
the
same
smooth
body
that
makes
it
surprisingly
drinkable
nice
sweet
chocolate
caramel
and
vanilla
to
balance
it
out
too
i
dont
even
like
scotch
and
i
enjoyed
this
overall
damn
good
like
an
aged
stout
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
and
there
are
also
some
rauchbier
qualities
present
very
very
good
beer
for
special
occasions
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
jet
black
with
no
head
theres
a
thin
light
tan
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
there
are
a
few
tiny
visible
bubbles
along
the
side
of
the
glass
that
are
rising
to
the
top
the
aroma
is
so
awesome
on
this
beer
i
get
chocolate
toffee
oak
nuts
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
smokiness
and
vanilla
i
get
some
of
that
malt
as
well
but
it
blends
so
well
with
the
other
aromas
the
flavor
is
just
as
awesome
as
the
aroma
though
definitely
more
scotch
heavy
than
the
16
the
taste
does
follow
the
nose
with
those
chocolate
toffee
vanilla
oak
nuts
and
some
smokiness
the
smell
keeps
hitting
the
nose
during
each
sip
which
only
helps
make
you
want
to
drink
this
more
the
body
on
this
beer
is
surprisingly
medium
and
very
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
beer
its
a
real
treat
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
smooth
mineral
taste
salt
and
green
tea
salty
caramel
and
some
aged
woody
vanilla
smoke
very
well
put
together
amazing
beer
all
around
complex
dynamic
and
demands
your
attention

nice
woody
flavor
complimented
by
dark
roasted

char
from

tastes
more
like

a
beer
especially
in
the
finish
very
complex
almost
no

very
well
done

the
carbonation
is
slight
but
its
ample
and
the
body
is
a
full
as
they
come
bitter
finish
is
interesting
here
sort
of
contradicts
the
whiskey
flavors
but
its
something
new
overall
a
real
fancy
beer
that
i
was
happy
to
pay
9
bucks
for
twice
a
treat
to
get
stuff
like
this
on
tap
in
the
usa
o
imo
the
121618yo
are
all
interchangeable
just
subtle
differences
the
older
you
go
o
this
is
the
harviestoun
house
style
on
steroids
d
i
had
the
option
of
buying
either
the
12
year
16
year
or
18
year
and
selected
this
vintage
mostly
due
to
reviews
on
this
site
after
having
this
i
would
love
to
do
a
sidebysidebyside
with
all
3
to
really
pick
them
apart
one
of
the
most
complex
english
old
ales
ive
ever
had
i
think
the
time
definitely
helped
d
i
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
all
3
other
ola
dubh
offerings
i
had
tried
leading
up
to
this
and
this
brew
was
no
different
a
delicious
old
ale
with
a
nice
earthy
profile
that
really
appeals
to
me
great
beer
o
great
beer
i
love
scotch
and
beer
better
than
the
30
i
had
probably
because
it
is
fresher
d
a
decent
drinking
brew
but
ill
be
honest
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
was
looking
for
something
in
the
ballpark
of
ryeonrye
but
it
ended
up
being
its
weakling
little
bro
perhaps
time
has
taken
too
much
of
a
toll
on
this
one
overall
very
nice
the
whisky
is
nicely
integrated
into
the
base
beer
overall
i
thought
that
the
ages
of
the
barrels
would
be
a
gimmicky
imperceptible
difference
maybe
it
is
and
harviestoun
is
changing
something
besides
the
barrels
this
one
definitely
seems
to
be
a
marked
improvement
over
both
the
12
and
the
18
i
have
a
30
left
and
well
see
if
that
one
is
better
than
this
overall
smells
nice
big
smokey
roasty
flavours
but
not
especially
enjoyable
flavours
in
the
base
beer
to
compliment
overall
just
a
wonderful
beer
the
flavor
is
good
if
honestly
unremarkable
but
the
aroma
and
that
outstanding
mouthfeel
mean
i
have
to
grade
this
one
outstandingly
high
brost
lampertland
despite
the
low
rating
on
smell
i
want
to
buy
this
again
and
show
it
off
to
my
friends
and
then
store
a
few
bottles
to
try
a
few
years
from
now
fantastic
find
o
3
5
o
very
drinkable
and
tasty
the
scotch
compliments
the
beer
so
well
it
is
really
a
remarkable
treat
the
relatively
high
level
of
hops
in
this
series
is
reminiscent
of
american
stouts
like
great
divide
yeti
imperial
stout
goes
great
with
steak
o
i
tried
this
one
in
pair
with
a
ola
dubh
special
reserve
12
which
had
been
aged
for
the
same
length
of
time
i
must
say
that
the
12
year
version
is
far
better
than
this
one
after
aging
this
one
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
but
maybe
it
doesnt
win
on
aging
good
beer
but
made
me
crave
an
ris
proper
ospectacular
for
whiskey
fans
but
easy
enough
to
drink
by
someone
who
may
not
have
a
whiskey
palette
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
especially
at
the
start
of
each
taste
however
i
really
dont
feel
like
this
was
worth
it
to
be
completely
honest
while
it
definitely
is
amazing
i
would
like
to
know
how
similar
vintages
compared
with
this
a
truly
special
beer
and
definitely
the
oldest
i
have
ever
tried
o
this
beer
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
especially
considering
its
smoothness
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
present
in
the
taste
pours
a
great
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
great
tan
if
bit
small
head
and
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
it
has
a
wonderful
scent
part
coffee
part
whiskey
part
malt
part
hop
a
near
perfectly
balanced
scent
that
ends
with
a
sweet
note
slighty
more
to
the
cocoa
and
bourbon
side
wonderful
taste
the
whiskey
flavor
is
there
but
not
overly
dominant
like
so
many
other
such
beers
it
has
a
great
slight
coffee
start
with
a
wonderful
dark
malty
old
ale
flavor
a
nice
sweet
finish
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
to
tone
it
down
it
goes
down
wonderfully
smooth
for
such
a
bold
beer
just
a
hair
more
bourbon
in
the
finish
than
the
16
absolutely
freaking
fantastic
smoothrich
roasty
taste
with
some
fizzy
furry
candy
sugar
in
there
chocolate
dominates
the
initial
flavours
before
the
furry
fuzzy
takes
a
more
prominent
role
followed
by
more
earth
at
the
end
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
the
body
could
do
with
some
stuffing
to
harden
it
up
but
still
pretty
nicely
executed
and
fine
when
i
saw
that
they
had
this
on
cask
at
the
old
tap
table
i
was
really
impressed
i
ordered
one
right
away
because
i
had
enjoyed
trying
so
many
of
the
others
this
is
the
first
and
only
one
that
i
havent
had
from
a
bottle
so
far
the
beer
poured
out
jet
black
in
color
no
surprise
there
the
smell
of
the
beer
wasrich
with
smokey
and
roasted
aromas
as
well
as
scotch
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
about
the
same
as
the
12
to
me
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
light
i
think
the
cask
aging
didnt
benefit
this
beer
in
my
opinion
at
all
overall
it
was
worth
trying
but
i
would
only
ever
buy
the
30
and
40
year
ones
again
a
tasty
and
balanced
barrel
aged
old
ale
lots
of
flavour
well
balanced
barrel
character
and
good
mouthfeel
nice
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
its
super
complex
i
think
i
enjoy
beers
aged
in
scotch
barrels
more
than
bourbon
barrels
so
i
hope
more
brewers
will
do
that
i
think
i
liked
this
a
smidge
better
than
the
12
but
itd
be
nice
to
do
a
vertical
at
some
point
with
all
of
them
and
see
a
great
cigar
ale
final
notes
a
good
beer
to
warm
up
with
as
we
move
into
the
winter
months
or
for
scotch
lovers
looking
to
get
into
beer
imagine
drinking
this
one
after
a
hot
bowl
of
soup
in
the
dead
of
winter
incredible
beer
expensive
but
ohso
worth
it
o
the
nice
rich
smoky
flavor
has
no
bandaid
or
off
qualities
at
all
and
is
supported
by
a
smooth
stout
with
some
flavors
developing
a
bit
as
it
warms
very
nice
sipper
d
each
one
i
have
in
this
series
steps
it
up
a
notch
from
the
previous
one
right
when
i
thought
the
16year
was
great
this
one
might
even
be
better
i
loved
this
beer
i
had
two
i
wanted
to
buy
a
growler
of
it
but
its
pricey
drinkability
and
overall
impression
ive
had
no
trouble
sipping
my
way
through
this
beer
and
ill
be
more
than
happy
to
have
it
or
any
of
its
cousins
again
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
wonderfully
well
made
beer
and
i
greatly
enjoyed
it
my
major
regret
is
not
being
able
to
sample
this
series
of
beers
side
by
side
so
as
to
be
able
to
really
have
a
shot
at
finding
how
the
age
of
the
whisky
that
was
in
the
barrel
affects
the
base
beer
certainly
with
this
one
the
whisky
notes
are
smoother
and
hard
to
separate
out
as
a
different
component
creamy
smooth
and
light
in
body
for
such
a
packedout
beer
this
is
definitely
one
that
i
would
seek
out
again
it
is
wellbodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
for
a
great
release
of
flavors
really
solid
stuff
od
more
complex
than
the
16
but
in
a
less
pleasant
way
alot
more
alcohol
is
noticable
and
that
ashy
aspect
holds
it
back
otherwise
its
alright
but
there
are
others
in
the
series
worth
checking
out
before
this
imo
cheers
the
aroma
was
loaded
with
peat
this
was
not
nearly
as
smoky
as
the
16
was
and
to
be
honest
had
a
good
deal
more
sweetness
to
it
which
was
a
bit
surprising
the
scotch
and
oak
aromas
were
there
but
light
as
this
was
coming
in
a
little
bit
under
what
i
had
though
but
was
nonetheless
very
good
still
extremely
rich
and
complex
i
decided
to
go
in
and
take
a
taste
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
the
body
of
it
coming
off
very
well
indeed
it
was
a
full
bodied
ale
for
sure
with
the
carbonation
coming
in
a
little
bit
above
some
of
the
others
offering
it
that
nice
silky
feel
at
times
the
rich
flavor
of
peat
was
really
coming
across
well
the
light
flavor
of
molasses
and
wood
now
coming
to
the
front
with
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
in
there
as
well
some
nice
dark
fruity
notes
lingering
way
in
the
back
remnants
of
the
barrel
for
sure
somewhat
of
a
thin
mouth
feel
for
a
strong
beer
like
this
but
with
a
slightly
sweeter
finish
than
the
12
and
16
year
versions
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
something
i
wont
soon
forget
a
truly
excellent
drink
for
beer
geeks
and
scotch
fans
alike
drinkability
is
high
complex
and
satisfying
with
a
clever
mouthfeel
wish
i
bought
more
of
these
when
they
were
available
next
year
ill
stock
up

i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
it
has
a
great
flavor
to
it
im
glad
i
chose
to
try
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
by
this
brewery
i
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
come
across
it
while
this
might
be
the
best
example
of
scotchbarrel
aging
ive
tried
its
not
approaching
mindblowing
status
its
a
good
stout
but
at
this
price
there
are
quite
a
few
others
id
rather
buy
from
what
ive
heard
im
just
going
to
bite
the
bullet
and
shell
out
for
the
good
stuff
30
and
40
next
time
i
run
into
these
d
a
sipper
this
is
a
special
beverage
that
deserves
respect
strength
is
a
bit
limiting
but
it
can
still
be
enjoyed
by
the
bottle
you
dont
have
to
split
it
although
it
would
be
generous
of
you
having
previously
enjoyed
the
18
year
old
highland
park
whisky
im
delighted
to
find
the
same
beauty
in
this
spinoff
project
from
its
countrymen
all
the
weight
of
a
wellmade
generous
malt
blended
into
a
worldclass
cocoaheavy
porter
and
still
full
of
an
island
character
delivered
with
the
deftest
of
touches
sublime
aye
this
is
d
very
drinkable
tons
of
flavor
the
whiskey
heat
could
slow
you
down
just
a
smidge
but
not
that
much
a
good
brew
but
the
higher
in
the
series
i
go
the
harder
i
find
it
is
to
defend
the
price
drinkability
is
good
at
8
abv
this
is
probably
one
of
the
lighter
ba
stoutsold
ales
out
there
highland
park
15
is
one
of
my
favorite
whiskys
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
the
highland
park
barrels
come
through
nicely
in
the
flavor
but
the
base
beer
could
use
a
little
more
of
something
overall
this
is
still
a
tasty
brew
but
could
be
tweaked
a
little
bit
looks
like
ill
have
to
seek
out
the
other
variations
overall
its
nice
i
tend
to
prefer
the
richer
old
ales
but
this
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
barrel
character
i
think
my
clothes
are
gonna
smell
that
is
the
first
comment
made
on
the
smokey
flavor
of
this
super
dark
beer
if
you
like
campfire
type
smoke
this
one
is
for
you
solid
taste
the
whole
way
through
the
dark
molasses
look
drinks
easier
than
it
looks
middle
of
the
pack
enjoyment
of
the
series
must
do
a
vertical
one
night
pours
black
wiskey
smoke
aromas
milk
chocolate
taste
a
little
more
bitter
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
bit
more
than
medium
mouthfeel
whiskey
is
right
there
good
drinkability
pours
an
incredibly
dark
opaque
brown
colour
with
thin
tan
head
head
retention
isnt
the
best
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
mild
smoke
and
peat
with
roasted
malt
flavour
is
quite
sweet
with
almost
no
bitterness
thick
mouthfeel
pretty
creamy
i
think
this
is
much
more
balanced
than
the
ola
dubh
16
that
i
had
a
couple
days
ago
wonderul
beer
d
i
love
good
smokey
scotch
so
it
is
no
surprise
that
this
beer
impressed
me
great
balance
and
drinkability
get
it
when
you
see
it
you
dont
have
to
like
whiskey
to
love
this
beer
in
fact
if
youre
like
me
and
appreciate
the
complexity
and
depth
of
a
quality
whiskey
but
dont
necessarily
have
a
palate
or
stomach
to
tolerate
the
excessive
alcohol
that
comes
with
it
ola
dubh
18
is
perfect
regardless
of
how
your
eyes
feel
about
the
price
tag
i
promise
your
nose
and
mouth
will
be
grateful
need
more
convincing
go
back
and
remind
yourself
of
what
i
had
to
say
about
flavour
better
than
the
16
but
not
as
good
as
the
higher
numbers
d
perhaps
not
as
lovely
as
the
ola
dubh
12
but
this
beer
has
its
own
merits
and
attitude
like
an
older
whisky
less
zesty
and
punchy
but
more
sober
and
smooth
more
sippable
less
fun
i
feel
like
the
18
is
begging
for
an
armchair
and
a
roaring
fire
someday
i
hope
to
oblige
it
m
medium
body
lightly
carbonated
pours
just
off
black
with
a
finger
or
two
of
tan
head
falling
to
a
thin
film
and
some
bubbles
smells
of
sweet
and
chocolate
covered
dark
fruits
some
almond
here
too
significantly
less
roastiness
and
smoke
than
the
12
and
16
light
peatiness
creeps
through
as
well
to
round
it
out
taste
is
some
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
with
more
chocolate
notes
light
smoke
and
peat
in
the
finish
the
light
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
and
caramel
really
blends
nicely
with
the
smoke
and
peat
mouthfeel
is
good
but
could
be
a
bit
fuller
but
this
is
a
bit
more
than
a
sipper
for
me
goes
down
quite
easily
about
on
par
with
the
12
and
better
than
the
16
d
one
advantage
of
the
lessthanfull
body
flavor
is
that
you
could
actually
session
this
beer
taken
in
that
context
the
combo
of
smells
and
flavors
is
simply
fantastic
however
the
rarity
price
makes
that
more
of
a
pipe
dream
mediumbodied
and
more
oily
than
the
gulf
too
soon
its
about
average
in
terms
of
drinkability
for
an
8
but
its
unlikely
i
would
drink
a
second
bottle
in
the
same
sitting
barrelaged
brews
in
general
tend
to
be
unsessionable
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
matching
moderate
to
light
level
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
not
bad
but
i
was
not
expecting
the
peted
aspect
of
this
brew
to
be
this
dominating
im
guessing
there
is
significant
inclusion
of
pete
or
smoked
malts
to
the
grain
bill
if
not
wow
scotch
barrels
really
have
influence
in
a
brew
tastes
a
lot
like
smooth
scotch
d
a
work
of
art
as
im
concerned
perfect
balance
between
barrel
and
brew
some
of
these
have
missed
the
mark
but
this
one
split
the
arrow
alls
i
can
say
is
wow
that
being
said
it
is
a
beast
even
for
8
abv
the
whiskey
does
let
you
know
your
in
the
big
leagues
and
you
wont
forget
it
i
was
loving
this
one
but
will
be
looking
at
my
recent
review
for
the
12
to
see
what
i
felt
was
different
because
i
remember
it
being
quite
similar
to
this
this
bottle
was
a
year
old
if
anyone
cares
like
all
the
ola
dubh
beers
this
is
great
i
really
enjoy
this
it
is
an
overall
excellent
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
others
in
the
series
this
is
a
must
try
it
reminded
me
an
ola
dubh
40
but
with
much
more
drinkability
aged
in
barrels
used
for
maturation
of
single
malt
18
years
whisky
that
gives
complexity
to
this
different
and
sensational
beer
color
black
that
seems
black
oil
viscous
texture
almost
like
a
liqueur
aroma
of
vanilla
oak
whiskey
something
smoked
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
all
that
just
in
aroma
flavor
of
roasted
malt
sweet
sour
vanilla
coffee
chocolate
wine
madeira
and
porto
and
especially
whiskey
and
oak
wood
low
carbonation
and
long
aftertaste
of
whiskey
alcohol
and
coffee
wonderful
nice
beer
will
drink
more
of
these
d
for
such
a
rich
and
tasty
beer
the
drinkability
is
high
i
disagree
with
the
brewery
and
think
this
is
excellent
on
its
own
however
id
love
to
try
this
with
strong
cheese
or
a
rich
beef
or
lamb
stew
this
is
a
true
beer
lovers
beer
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
cream
of
the
crop
when
it
comes
to
a
whisky
aged
beer
very
enjoyable
the
base
beer
is
tasty
enough
would
make
a
decent
wee
heavy
on
its
own
and
the
cask
aging
shines
through
with
an
excellent
choice
of
whisky
to
add
that
special
extra
element
this
ones
a
winner
i
just
wish
they
werent
so
expensivehowever
you
do
get
what
you
pay
for
d
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
will
certainly
pick
up
more
if
i
see
it
in
the
states
picked
this
one
up
in
london
perfect
beer
for
sunday
night
heading
into
a
work
week
one
of
the
bigger
surprises
on
tap
at
the
ck
recently
now
i
dont
have
to
shell
out
for
the
bottle
it
pours
a
dead
black
topped
by
the
slightest
bit
o
bubbles
that
could
be
construed
as
a
head
the
nose
comprises
oak
whiskey
vanilla
figs
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
similar
only
theres
somehow
more
smoky
whiskey
and
oak
notes
crammed
in
there
damn
son
the
body
is
a
light
heavy
with
a
carbonation
that
is
barely
able
to
express
itself
it
pains
me
to
see
it
like
this
and
a
rather
thick
and
chewy
feel
this
is
a
fine
brew
indeed
now
ive
gotta
find
a
way
to
sample
the
other
vintages
11
2
ounce
bottle
bottled

2009
bottle
09207
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
14
inch
tan
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
there
is
a
good
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
very
nice
it
smells
like
scotch
whisky
peat
smoke
toffee
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
iodine
and
dark
fruit
the
brew
tastes
like
peat
and
smoke
from
the
highland
park
barrel
aging
roasted
malt
toffee
and
a
bit
of
iodine
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
but
it
does
seem
a
little
bit
thin
to
me
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
but
then
i
also
like
smoky
scotch
whisky
so
im
a
bit
biased
it
is
a
pricey
brew
but
i
thought
it
was
worth
it
to
try
once
impressive
bottle
that
makes
the
beer
look
like
you
need
to
buy
pours
a
tar
black
but
thin
brown
lingering
head
scents
of
licorice
and
dark
chocolate
smoke
smokey
notes
but
not
overpowering
starts
off
thin
on
the
tongue
maybe
because
im
use
to
the
imperial
stouts
that
have
lots
of
residual
sugars
smokey
taste
right
off
the
bat
and
a
lingering
licorice
after
taste
alcohol
not
very
high
but
i
do
get
bourbon
notes
as
well
it
seems
like
there
is
something
missing
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
overall
i
would
suggest
trying
another
for
its
price
tag
is
not
worth
the
taste
my
opinion
slightly
chewy
medium
body
with
a
very
prominent
whiskey
barrel
presence
that
overtakes
the
roasted
dark
malt
presence
underneath
there
is
a
very
faint
viscous
chocolate
malt
character
with
hints
of
espresso
bean
toffee
oatmeal
and
burnt
toast
the
complex
balance
suggested
in
the
nose
is
missing
here
with
an
overwhelming
bourbon
presence
very
hot
and
sweet
overpowering
the
subtle
vanilla
caramel
and
toffee
notes
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
but
overall
the
bourbon
is
too
strong
overpowering
the
other
flavors
overall
a
fairly
solid
beer
lots
of

prominent
here
a

too
sweet
could
use
more
smoke
or
dryness
but
it
does
have
a
nice
whisky
and
malt
character
still
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
imo
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
in
the
line
of
ola

i
dont
know
what
the
price
tag
of
this
thing
is
in
the
us
but
im
sure
its
pretty
high
and
maybe
not
good
value
for
money
but
if
youve
got
the
money
and
like
single
malt
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
an
opportunity
to
try
these
beers
they
are
worth
it
the
40
is
the
best
though
d
good
strong
flavors
do
not
overwhelm
at
all
overall
a

2009
vintage
this
looked
the
same
as
the
12
and
16
year
ola
dubhs
it
smelled
similar
chocolate
and
caramel
and
honey
wheat
and
roasted
coffee
but
lighter
and
sweeter
without
as
much
peat
or
oak
and
more
prominent
alcohol
it
tasted
similar
also
roasted
barley
and
burnt
coffee
and
molasses
with
a
strong
oak
and
peat
finish
but
with
more
prominent
oak
and
peat
and
burnt
flavors
and
more
noticeable
alcohol
it
was
maybe
thicker
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
somewhat
relatively
harsh
finish
overall
this
had
a
great
smell
and
taste
as
the
other
ola
dubhs
but
it
was
clear
how
a
couple
years
of
age
had
benefited
the
12
and
16
versus
this
fresh
18
year
the
others
were
more
mellow
and
had
a
bit
of
added
depth
and
complexity
and
delicate
sense
if
given
the
choice
between
a
16
and
18
that
were
both
fresh
or
aged
the
same
amount
it
would
probably
be
difficult
to
justify
paying
the
extra
bit
for
the
18
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
it
for
dessert
or
for
any
occasion
when
a
whisky
would
be
appropriate
this
would
also
pair
well
with
lamb
very
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
just
the
right
carbonation
cost
me
6
tickets
to
get
it
overall
a
super
good
dark
old
ale
and
being
as
old
as
it
was
it
certainly
showed
in
the
wonderful
flavor
and
balance
a
must
have
if
you
can
this
is
a
highly
complex
ale
and
probably
my
favorite
so
far
out
of
the
ola
dubh
series
ive
also
had
12
and
30
wonderfully
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
a
750ml
or
22oz
bomber
of
this
rather
than
just
11
2
ounces
certainly
one
to
be
savored
highly
recommended
frankly
of
the
two
i
preferred
the
12
but
this
is
still
excellent
stuff
had
this
on
cask
at
the
brick
store
pub
as
a
gravity
pour
im
a
big
fan
of
this
series
of
beers
and
of
the
brewery
in
general
but
this
particular
one
didnt
resonate
with
me
quite
as
much
as
some
of
the
others
in
fact
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
much
still
good
mind
you
but
a
bit
over
the
top
and
not
quite
as
smooth
as
the
older
ones
and
perhaps
a
bit
hotter
than
even
the
12
regardless
absolutely
wonderful
to
see
this
at
the
brick
store
and
lovely
to
taste
this
pours
black
with
no
head
but
a
slight
ring
around
the
glass
the
whisky
is
extremely
prominent
in
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
heat
peat
ash
dark
malt
and
chocolate
notes
the
taste
also
exhibits
huge
whisky
flavor
with
lots
of
heat
and
peat
some
berry
flavors
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
hot
a
little
much
overall
perhaps
the
beer
itself
will
mellow
a
bit
with
time
if
there
is
some
of
this
put
away
at
the
brewery
i
much
prefer
the
30
or
40
or
really
even
the
16

notes
of
sweet

almonds
brown

drinks
like
the

it
is
a
very
smooth
and
tasty
one
to
be
sure
overall
i
thought
there
was
a
bit
more
whiskey
influence
on
the
18
year
than
in
the
12
year
but
other
than
that
they
seemed
very
similar
this
was
certainly
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
and
i
only
hope
that
the
bar
that
stocks
it
doesnt
run
out
before
i
have
a
chance
to
come
back
for
more
overall
even
though
i
much
prefer
the
other
vintanges
this
was
still
a
stellar
brew
recommended
for
fans
of
ola
dubh
pours
with
a
small
white
head
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
small
particles
floating
within
the
ale
smells
sweet
from
the
hops
the
hops
give
it
a
pine
and
citrus
taste
a
hint
of
malt
is
also
present
overall
taste
is
great
somehow
the
brewers
at
saint
arnold
have
actually
captured
christmas
in
a
bottle
but
as
i
stated
at
the
outset
its
a
good
beerand
a
welcome
break
from
much
of
the
holiday
fare
one
sometimes
encounters
however
at
the
same
time
had
it
been
sold
consistently
at
8
per
sixpack
i
probably
would
not
have
swooped
in
for
seconds
much
less
more
my
favorite
beer
during
the
holidays
mellow
and
tasty
yet
strong
and
distinct
spices
work
well
with
this
brew
not
overpowering
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
for
what
it
is
a
hearty
maltforward
ale
there
is
no
spices
added
which
is
what
many
people
associate
holiday
beers
with
i
personally
consider
it
a
celebratory
beefedup
version
of
their
amber
ale
amazing
beer
every
houstonian
should
try
overall
an
ok
kind
of
bland
christmas
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
here
from
saint
arnold
not
the
best
but
definitely
worth
a
try
just
as
i
remember
it
from
past
bottlings
great
go
to
all
round
beer
when
available
high
c
winter
warmer
or
old
ale
either
way
its
not
my
favorite
style
so
my
numbers
will
be
off
by
0
25
to
0
50
or
more
i
personally
wouldnt
recommend
trying
more
than
a
single
brew
or
two
of
this
i
made
it
through
a
6pack
fine
but
i
wont
touch
this
one
again
pours
dark
amber
color
with
thick
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
although
head
retention
is
decent
mild
lacing
has
a
mildly
spicy
apple
aroma
bready
taste
up

this
one

there
was

very
small
off

on
it
that
didnt
linger
or
leave

pretty
decent

caramel

with
a

of

a
subdued
sweetness
with
some
bitterness
trying
to
come
through
resulting
in
a
hint
of
dryness
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
blah
brew
to
me
despite
the
great
respect
i
have
for
this
brewery
a
decent
tasting
christmas
beer
you
can
taste
the
spices
but
they
dont
overwhelm
the
beer
taste
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
there
are
a
lot
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
beer
smells
of
toffee
and
chocolate
there
are
some
floral
notes
as
well
from
the
hops
what
hits
the
tongue
is
a
big
malt
presence
with
toffee
and
chocolate
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
taste
as
do
the
hops
which
bring
some
floral
earthy
and
mild
spice
notes
to
the
taste
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
strong
carbonation
this
leads
to
a
cleaner
than
expected
finish
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
very
yeasty
very
malty
sweet
christmasy
beer
but
i
feel
it
could
be
more
balanced
its
not
as
satisfying
as
a
lot
of
saint
arnolds
beers
but
it
still
has
a
unique
flavor
and
feel
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
a
year
nice
for
a
winter
warmer
but
im
not
getting
why
they
call
it
a
christmas
ale
i
generally
tend
to
think
of
christmas
ales
as
spiced
beers
but
there
is
not
a
trace
of
spice
or
holiday
flavor
in
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
its
delicious
this
is
very
good
stuff
really
spreads
the
christmas
cheer
to
your
mouth
overall
impression
not
sure
whats
going
on
with
this
one
a
nice
brew
but
a
winter
warmer
couldnt
even
believe
this
one
was
7
when
i
looked
at
it
again
i
wouldnt
dis
this
one
just
wont
be
going
back
to
it
and
has
some
work
to
do
o
i
suppose
its
a
little
bit
above
average
stylistically
but
in
general
i
wouldnt
particularly
recommend
it
i
suppose
id
drink
another
but
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
cant
say
i
like
this
beer
o
the
beer
is
ok
but
i
would
pass
over
this
for
other
holiday
ales
overall
a
lowkey
christmas
ale
not
bad
just
doesnt
have
any
christmas
spirit
dandy
with
baked
chicken
o
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
its
like
a
spicy
lager
no
thanks
ive
had
other
beers
from
saint
arnold
that
have
been
outstanding
but
this
beer
falls
short
for
me
overall
the
finish
on
this
beer
was
overly
dry
still
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
have
another
overall
id
get
this
one
with
breckenridges
christmas
beer
o
i
have
passed
this
one
up
on
the
shelf
all
the
time
but
never
purchased
till
now
and
i
will
say
im
kind
of
impressed
this
is
what
i
imagine
a
true
christmas
ale
to
be
add
some
belgian
yeast
to
this
one
as
a
variant
and
i
bet
it
would
taste
like
a
nice
quad
im
not
entirely
sure
what
the
difference
is
between
this
and
the
brown
ale
although
to
be
honest
i
havent
had
the
brown
in
a
while
this
is
a
nice
warming
ale
but
really
not
that
special
to
me
i
recommend
you
pick
up
some
up
now
and
decide
if
this
is
something
you
want
through
new
years
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
was
a
standard
for
the
next
few
weeks
overallhonestly
havent
had
too
many
winter
warmers
and
i
think
their
just
a
malty
spicey
beer
thats
similar
to
a
pumpkin
beer
minus
the
pumpkin
i
like
where
this
beer
is
going
but
needs
a
little
more
body
to
it
o
for
a
7
hides
the
alcohol
well
the
lightness
of
the
flavors
works
a
bit
in
its
favor
as
is
a
christmas
brew
you
can
drink
a
couple
of
and
not
feel
overpowered
d
o
this
is
not
the
greatest
winter
warmer
i
have
ever
had
but
a
very
solid
one
for
sure
not
a
bad
beer
just
doesnt
fit
style
ill
call
it
a
strong
amber
ale
o
a
very
nice
winter
seasonal
from
saint
arnold
would
definitely
drink
this
all
winter
if
i
still
lived
in
houston
pretty
good
but
the
body
is
too
light
this
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
good
off
white
head
the
smells
are
very
malt
heavy
break
caramel
and
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
just
a
little
hop
bite
the
taste
is
mostly
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
very
good
stuff
very
good
job
with
this
one
saint
arnold
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
not
a
great
one
either
the
spices
are
subdued
and
not
in
your
face
but
there
is
not
enough
complexity
provided
by
the
beer
to
make
it
anymore
then
a
spiced
beer
o
very
faded
in
its
time
this
beer
really
doesnt
hold
up
well
in
terms
of
flavor
profiles
but
it
is
far
from
undrinkable
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
fresh
to
see
if
there
are
any
spices
or
anything
else
that
may
have
faded
note
had
some
on
tap
that
was
aged
for
a
year
and
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
overall
this
is
a
delicious
offering
from
saint
arnolds
that
i
look
forward
to
every
christmas
excellent
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
spice
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
six
o
a
tasty
beer
from
sa
always
one
of
my
favorite
local
seasonals
though
a
bit
light
for
the
winter
i
look
more
forward
to
the
winter
stout
in
january
overall
a
very
interesting
winter
ale
to
be
drinking
while
the
weather
is
in
the
lowmid
100s
here
in
tx
but
it
works
for
me
although
id
probably
consider
this
more
of
a
cross
between
a
winter
warmer
and
an
amber
ale
considering
there
isnt
much
of
a
winter
in
the
region
of
south
texas
its
nice
to
see
a
fresh
offering
from
a
nearby
brewery
in
the
winter
warmer
category
into
a
brandy
glass
this
pours
a
clear
and
glimmering
amber
red
color
aroma
is
a
lush
one
of
candied
sweet
roasted
malt
and
fragrant
bright
fruit
a
robust
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
body
sweeps
over
the
palate
into
a
dry
and
warming
finish
with
notes
of
mild
cinnamon
and
roasted
sugar
im
look
forward
to
next
years
batch
already
thanks
matt
this
brew
has
great
flavor
and
is
very
well
balanced
rjt
awesome
beer
d
drinkability
is
moderate
flavors
are
a
bit
traditional
and
just
kind
of
there
but
it
certainly
hides
its
alcohol
well
couldve
helped
with
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
its
a
good
beer
but
a
confusing
beer
d
goes
down
nice
and
leaves
you
refreshed
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
mixes
well
with
all
of
the
other
flavors
overall
i
honestly
really
like
saint
arnolds
christmas
ale
i
will
definately
be
drinking
this
again
i
love
what
brock
wagner
is
doing
at
sa
and
i
enjoy
his
beers
atmosphere
is
decent
nice
appearance
and
a
malt
and
sweet
balanced
nose
flavor
is
a
syrupy
sweet
malt
base
with
a
little
spice
overall
this
is
a
solid
quaff
d
easy
easy
drinkin
d
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
winter
warmer
it
is
delicious
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
your
interest
without
overdoing
it
if
you
are
luck
enough
to
come
across
this
stock
up
on
a
sixer
or
two
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
has
a
nice
mix
of
spices
and
drinks
well
a
little
plain
but
worth
a
try
d
a
good

cold
weather
occasional
drinker
fits
the
night
well
a
fresh
snow
on
the
ground
and
rather
chilly
working
well
sitting
on
the
couch
in
front
of
the
fireplace
i
couldnt
have
this
every
day
but
it
is
hitting
the
spot
at
the
moment
d
fairly
drinkable
but
the
flavor
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
nonetheless
it
is
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
copperbronze
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
white
color
there
are
a
few
bubbles
on
top
as
well
the
nose
is
quite
plain
with
just
a
tad
bit
of
pine
and
cinnamon
along
with
some
caramel
backing
the
taste
is
along
the
same
linespine
and
a
bit
of
faint
spicing
plus
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
overall
nothing
offensive
as
it
doesnt
take
the
spicing
too
far
though
its
quite
boring
d
very
clean
a
little
high
in
abv
to
be
highly
drinkable
for
me
overall
it
was
an
above
average
christmas
brew
thus
far
i
have
tried
sam
adams
winter
lager
and
shiner
holiday
cheer
and
between
all
three
this
one
was
my
favorite
it
had
a
good
bitterness
to
it
along
with
a
nice
malt
profile
d
this
beer
does
not
seem
to
be
at
7
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
could
drink
a
few
i
definitely
would
not
have
this
at
my
christmas
dinner
d
not
nearly
as
bad
i
was
anticipating
to
be
honest
a
nice
little
winter
warmer
in
the
beginning
of
southern
california
summer
mediumfull
body
with
tingly
carbonation
very
active
beer
slightly
offputting
finish
but
still
a
tasty
beer
not
bad
per
style
thanks
ericandersnavy
for
the
oppportunity
d
i
could
see
having
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
the
abv
was
not
so
high
as
to
distract
it
from
the
beer
even
though
the
flavors
were
a
bit
muted
at
times
this
beer
was
still
very
enjoyable
would
recommend
this
to
most
people
who
dont
want
to
drink
hop
or
malt
bombs
but
still
want
flavor
in
their
beers
d
goes
down
easy
relatively
tasty
decent
drinkability
on
this
beer
md
fairly
drinkable
especially
for
the
7
percent
okay
mouthfeel
that
is
not
overly
smooth
but
not
great
overall
its
a
decent
winter
warmer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
for
a
winter
warmer
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
beer
im
looking
for
a
dark
creamy
beer
for
a
ww
but
i
dont
feel
this
beer
is
really
out
of
style
just
not
what
i
look
for
reddish
copper
with
a
thin
creamy
head
and
a
celebratory
little
bubble
show
going
on
smells
of
biscuits
caramel
and
roses
my
mouth
watered
as
i
wrote
that
taste
is
sharp
and
spicy
up
front
then
mellows
to
a
warm
malt
the
end
stays
a
bit
sharp
just
a
hint
metallic
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
tingly
just
like
i
like
my
women
the
drinkability
is
very
good
the
dry
notes
make
me
want
more
thanks
exiled
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
overall
but
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
small
head
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
the
appearance
is
amber
and
clear
the
aroma
is
a
little
spicy
and
malty
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
mild
hop
bitterness
with
a
little
spice
perhaps
coriander
the
feel
is
light
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
finish
this
is
a
nice
local
choice
for
me
drinkability
much
better
this
time
actually
this
is
the
best
saint
arnold
beer
iver
had
for
a
cask
the
head
was
a
bit
disappointing
a
very
bright
smelling
winter
warmer
of
apple
fruit
and
pineapple
citrus
candy
quality
palate
was
mild
and
exactly
that
body
wise
for
a
cask
it
was
flat
not
much
of
a
voluminous
quality
not
much
of
a
expanded
malt
woodiness
which
was
in
part
because
the
beer
didnt
have
much
of
a
bitter
sweet
finish
it
was
just
mainly
the
fruitiness
quite
easy
going
down
but
not
a
winter
warmer
of
choice
d
its
ok
on
drinkablity
cant
really
detect
any
alcohol
flavor
it
tastes
ok
but
comparing
it
to
other
christmas
releases
id
have
to
say
it
is
just
average
notes
a
solid
drinking
winter
seasonal
with
good
spice
flavor
and
hop
profile
however
nothing
stands
out
to
me
just
above
average
all
around
dvery
drinkable
indeed
i
highly
suggest
this
beer
to
any
beer
lover
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
this
beer
pours
burnt
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
the
smell
is
malty
sweetness
with
a
little
bit
of
unidentifiable
spices
the
flavor
is
more
malt
possibly
biscuit
malt
with
a
strong
aftertaste
of
spices
such
as
cloves
there
is
more
in
there
i
just
cant
tell
exactly
what
it
is
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stands
out
but
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
lighter
winter
warmer
with
no
trace
of
the
7
percent
alcohol
nice
beer
this
christmas
ale
improves
significantly
as
it
warms
delivering
a
sweet
dried
fruit
note
on
the
front
that
gives
way
to
soft
spices
pale
malts
gingerbread
and
a
hoppy
piny
finish
the
medium
body
is
crisp
and
peppery
on
the
palate
with
an
uppity
carbonation
level
that
livens
up
the
mouthfeel
overall
saint
arnolds
christmas
ale
delivers
on
what
it
promisesa
solid
beer
to
accompany
the
mildly
chilly
winter
nights
in
texas
reminds
me
of
a
toneddown
version
of
great
lakes
nosferatu
not
the
most
drinkable
but
good
drinkability
sessionable
yes
and
affordable
but
there
are
a
few
other
holiday
ales
that
are
just
a
little
more
my
style
burnt
orange
thin
eggshell
head
smell
is
cloves
with
cherries
dark
fruits
maybe
a
slight
hint
of
cinnamon
or
some
other
earthiness
taste
is
spicy
with
many
tastes
going
on
there
is
cinnamon
in
the
taste
coriander
maybe
some
nutmeg
in
the
finish
has
a
bready
quality
to
it
some
maltiness
to
give
it
a
bit
of
backbone
against
spiced
nature
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
and
it
is
a
bit
sticky
upfront
tongue
even
feels
a
bit
strange
like
one
had
just
had
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
overall
id
say
this
suffers
from
a
lack
of
simplicity
there
is
just
too
much
going
on
in
this
beer
maybe
time
would
mellow
this
one
out
quite
interesting
had
not
expected
this
beer
for
a
christmas
ale
because
i
had
expected
darker
but
this
was
definitely
refreshing
d
christmas
in
july
heavens
no
hell
yes
d
its
an
enjoyable
winter
warmer
well
done
st
arnold
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
you
guys
yet
consumed
at
my
cellar
temperature
low
sixties
and
not
recommended
midfifties
bonus
in
trade
from
a
generous
texas
trader
like
a
belgium
with
a
good
mix
of
malts
alcohol
aroma
pours
medium
body
and
significant
white
head
yeasty
taste
very
drinkable
indeed
above
average
mouthfeel
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
soapy
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
thick
lace
smells
mildly
of
some
spice
yeast
spiciness
not
literal
spice
i
dont
think
they
added
anything
to
it
a
sweet
caramellike
something
and
piney
hops
theres
a
piney
sticky
hop
flavor
when
you
first
sip
it
followed
by
some
big
malty
sweetness
there
is
as
is
typical
for
a
winter
warmer
theres
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
at
seven
percent
this
isnt
the
biggest
warmer
around
but
you
can
definitely
feel
it
i
was
a
little
worried
about
freshness
when
i
found
some
dusty
six
packs
in
the
liquor
store
but
the
alcohol
and
hops
have
held
this
one
up
well
taste
is
nice
but
nothing
that
is
wowing
medium
body
malty
and
crips
cracked
pepper
in
there
struggling
to
get
much
out
of
this
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
nice
but
taste
itself
is
very
average
a
malty
yet
with
a
touch
of
hops
brew
that
serves
as
a
nice
winter
warmer
not
bad
the
doughy
sweetness
and
spicy
nature
of
the
hops
used
really
made
this
stand
out
as
a
decent
christmas
beer
despite
the
lack
of
depth
to
the
body
this
still
stayed
fairly
quaffable
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
styleabv
a
nice
winter
warmer
that
is
going
down
well
on
a
cold
march
evening
yummy
drinks
fine
the
abv
is
somewhat
hidden
much
better
as
it
warms
up
decent
enough
just
not
my
bag
baby
decent
but
all
in
all
seems
like
a
slightly
stronger
version
of
their
brown
ale
pretty
good
for
our
winters
in
texas
fresh
piney
hop
and
toasty
bitterness
are
first
noticeable
along
with
a
sweet
caramely
malt
blast
finishes
off
with
a
bit
more
bitterness
and
slight
alcohol
warming
while
this
one
does
not
scream
winter
warmer
or
christmas
ale
it
is
one
of
saint
arnolds
better
beers
and
i
always
throw
a
sixer
or
two
into
the
holiday
beer
mix
this
was
pretty
good
but
there
are
christmas
ales
out
there
that
i
enjoy
more
d
a
decent
offering
sort
of
a
more
powerful
amber
ale
certainly
not
my
favorite
winter
offering
even
from
sa
id
much
rather
have
the
winter
stout
d
quite
drinkable
for
its
strength
a
pretty
good
christmas
beer
this
is
a
fairly
spicy
winter
warmer
and
a
nice
coldweather
sipper
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
7
abv
overall
this
is
a
really
easy
to
drink
and
at
7
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
it
is
complex
and
has
a
lot
of
taste
to
it
i
really
like
this
winter
beer
d
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
the
spices
arent
dominant
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
helps
increase
the
consumption
factor
i
only
received
one
of
these
via
trade
and
im
wishing
i
had
at
least
one
or
two
more
to
tide
me
until
spring
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
i
must
say
that
i
have
had
better
it
might
be
the
fact
that
this
has
been
sitting
in
my
cellarcloset
for
a
few
months
but
to
me
the
taste
expressions
seem
to
be
muted
pulled
this
out
because
it
has
been
cold
this
past
few
days
so
i
felt
this
was
as
good
a
beer
selection
as
any
i
have
a
few
more
saint
arnolds
from
whoneeds8
so
i
am
hoping
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
their
flavoring
after
trying
the
other
brews
good
beer
tasty
drinkable
but
nothing
special
for
a
christmas
ale
it
should
have
some
darker
malts
and
some
outstanding
flavors
this
is
no
better
than
average
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
very
small
tan
head
fades
almost
instantly
leaves
a
few
stray
spots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
big
malty
aromas
wafting
out
the
glass
sweet
caramel
some
gingery
spice
and
a
slight
boozy
undercurrent
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
in
the
mix
nice
on
the
heavy
end
of
mediumbodied
some
lingering
spice
and
bitterness
a
nice
winter
warmer
drinkability
good
drinkability
i
could
definately
sit
and
have
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
so
i
dont
normally
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
christmas
ales
some
are
great
but
ive
been
dissapointed
as
well
this
one
i
enjoyed
as
it
hand
a
nice
vanilla
caramel
note
which
i
found
tasty

reviews
as
of

so
ill
leave
the
expansive
review
format
for
today
worth
a
try
drinkability
wellbalanced
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
percentage
a
fine
endoftheyear
brew
from
st
arnold
taste
and
feel
is
creamier
than
anticipated
which
is
a
bit
strange
considering
how
decently
hopped
this
beer
is
honey
toffee
nutty
clove
nutmeg
that
rounds
out
a
pretty
unexpected
blanket
of
complexity
for
this
beer
the
malt
aspect
of
this
beer
is
pretty
bitter
and
almost
matches
the
hop
bitterness
really
enjoy
what
is
going
on
here
in
terms
of
spice
sweetness
and
bitterness
everything
thing
is
here
and
all
represented
equally
they
all
blend
together
nicely
but
can
be
picked
apart
just
as
well
if
you
want
to
my
glass
is
disappearing
pretty
quickly
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
pours
up
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
quickly
fading
tan
head
great
lacing
the
nose
is
malts
candied
raisins
a
wee
bit
boozy
not
much
though
the
taste
is
dark
fruits
raisins
malts
subtle
spices
candy
sugar
a
crisp
hop
balance
in
the
finish
kinda
like
a
sherry
beer
or
something
like
that
light
to
medium
bodied
low
smoothe
carbo
a
nice
sessionable
winter
warmer
good
stuff
glad
i
was
granted
the
opportunity
to
try
this
on
cask
during
a
recent
visit
to
the
lone
star
state
pours
ambergold
with
an
off
white
thick
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
lacing
is
ok
smell
of
roast
malts
but
not
much
else
taste
is
about
as
bland
theres
just
not
a
good
warming
effect
from
this
winter
warmer
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
little
too
carbonated
its
a
decent
beer
very
drinkable
but
just
not
all

worth
trying
d
great
beer
very
well
rounded
i
could
do
with
a
bit
more
spice
though
theres
a
really
heavy
mouthfeel
to
the
beer
which
kind
of
limits
the
drinkability
too
the
butterscotch
flavor
really
comes
out
when
it
hits
close
to
room
temperature
and
is
a
tad
cloying
definitely
a
sipper
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
white

that
dissipates
quickly
little
lacing
smells
of
sweet
almost
syrupy
malt
reminiscent
of
a
barley
wine
the
taste
is
similar
but
the
malt
is
less
dominant
and
hop
bitterness
comes
through
slight
date
and
banana
esters
a
bit

at

mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
decent
overall
d
since
there
is
nothing
at
all
offensive
about
it
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
verdict
whenever
i
check
the
beer
aisle
i
always
check
to
see
if
its
time
for
the
next
saint
arnold
seasonal
to
come
out
christmas
ale
is
just
another
great
reason
to
be
on
the
lookout
nicely
balanced
malt
and
spice
with
a
good
splash
of
booze
its
a
proper
winter
warmer
well
worth
picking
up
especially
at
the
bargain
prices
you
see
here
in
the
houston
area
pours

the

you
can
feel
the
warmth
from
this
brew
drinkable
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
drinkability
overall
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
not
quite
as
warming
as
some
other
winter
warmers
but
that
doesnt
take
much
away
would
be
great
for
thanksgiving
or
christmas
duh
d
you
can
drink
two
or
three
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
but
anymore
than
that
might
be
a
little
too
tough
to
swallow
pours
into
the
glass
a
brown
colored
body
has
a
dark
malty
aroma
a
sweet
taste
with
some
grapes
raisins
and
some
fruitiness
has
a
dark

taste
also
it
does
have
a
strong
alcohol
taste
to
it
sweet
spices
very
tasty
brew
im
looking
forward
to
some
great
winter
warmers
this
year
and
if
even
half
of
them
are
this
good
i
wont
be
disappointed
d
this
is
actually
fairly
drinkable
for
a
christmas
beer
because
the
spice
is
nicely
in
check
d
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
one
that
lets
you
know
the
alcohol
is
there
without
hitting
you
over
the
head
with
it
thanks
to
ballewblake
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
one
inch
loose
offwhite
head

sizzled
and
popped
around
the
edges

it
slowly
receded

the
side
of
the
glass
nose

sweet
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
spice
perhaps
nutmeg
and
caramel
taste
follows
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
revealed
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
mediumbodied
with
a
mild
consistent
effervescence
throughout
the
background
a
little
slickness
also
detected
in
the
consistency
excellent
drinkability
for
the
style
elements
of
the
winter
warmer
are
expressed
without
being
cloying
and
overwhelming
an
easy
drinking
representation
of
the
style
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
interesting
combination
of
hop
and
spice
my
glass
is
looking
pretty
sad
now
but
i
have
to
fight
off
the
urge
to
grab
another
after
two
of
these
i
can
definitely
tell
ive
been
drinking
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pretty
mild
but
with
good
spice
notes
good
malt
notes
a
nice
expressive
crisp
body
and
wellhidden
alcohol
give
it
a
shot
thanks
to
ballewblake

this
one
d
excellent
cool
weather
beer

also
enjoy
it
through
out
the
summer

would
like
to
drink

caramelized
like

very

the
finish
light

mouthfeel
is
medium

with
low
to
medium

nice
and
drinkable
when
it
warms
up
its
quite
nice
not
over
the
top
spicy
or
sweet
for
a
winter
warmer
thanks
greg
anyhow
nice
primer
for
when
it
cools
down
and
i
can
break
out
all
the
winter
warmers
cheers

poured
in
to
chalice
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
this
is
the
summer
release
of
the
brew
love
it
on
draught
in
the
winter
really
light
malts
and
hops
in
the
smell
very
mild
aromas
taste
is
great
after
working
on
the
house
for
a
few
hours
really
digging
the
mild
spices
and
malt
balance
a
good
year
round
xmas
brew
thats
super
easy
to
drink
interesting
beer
even
more
so
when
i
am
trying
it
for
the
first
time
in
100
degree
heat
d
definitely
drinkable
i
look
foward
to
having
more
in
the
fall
and
winter
when
the
texas
weather
turns
cooler
quite
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
in
the
summertime
when
its
105
outside
a
nice
break
from
the
hop
monsters
that
i
usually
crave
in
the
summer
thanks
to
turbine2475
for
including
this
beer
in
a
trade
and
giving
me
a
chance
to
try
it
pours
chestnut
with
little
head
but
a
swirly
cap
once
it
settles
smells
of
honey
nougat
orange
light
spice
and
a
bit
bready
the
taste
is
a
bit
spritzy
there
is
more
breadiness
a
good
bit
of
sweet
malt
figs
sweet
orange
pear
mace
and
maybe
some
clove
and
anise
on
the
finish
fairly
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
and
it
is
a
tad
overcarbonated
but
it
is
also
nicely
creamy
and
full
this
is
a
decent
winter
sipper
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
dnice
job
overall
a
nice
solid
brew
nothing
screams
out
for
attention
and
the
beer
is
an
entire
body
of
work
that
works
nicely
together
a
very
good
winter
warmer
or
in
this
case
a
cool
spring
night
warmer
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
does
not
age
very
well
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
i
am
not
sure
the
style
but
a
christmas
porter
would
probably
fit
the
bill
sure
there
are
better
ones
out
there
but
this
was
still
solid
and
i
would
in
no
way
turn
it
down
if
i
say
it
again
d
i
think
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
brew
it
helps
make
it
feel
like
winter

drinking
it

texas
clear

toffe

aroma
with
a

as
well

is
light
toffee
flavored
malt
again
with
a
light
note
of
spices
coming
into
the
flavor
as
well
and
a
light
bitterness
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
shows
but
still
very
drinkable
decent
beer
all
around
but
just
not
my
favorite
style
d
malty
and
smooth
brew
that
is
very
welcoming
and
a
good
addition
to
any
fridge
i
would
stock
up
on
this
beer
and
try
to
keep
some
on
hand
year
round
its
a
good
price
for
a
strong
very
above
average
beer
pours
a
bright
crystal
clear
dark
goldenamber
with
some
red
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
has
a
fluffy
white
head
and
lots
o
lacing
beautiful
color
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
some
nondescript
spices
taste
is
weak
caramel
malt
and
some
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
not
a
bad
brew
could
use
some
more
malt
and
a
bit
more
body
didnt
really
notice
the
7abv
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
2
beige
head
over
the
clear
orangey
amber
brew
thick
head
holds
steady
with
heavy
coating
lace
aroma
is
minimal
with
light
spicing
evident
taste
is
average
again
with
spicing
the
only
real
standout
characteristic
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
harsh
aide
and
drinkability
is
kind
of
limited
by
all
of
the
above
winter
warmers
are
not
usually
my
favorite
style
and
this
one
seems
to
fit
into
that
mold
your
mileage
may
vary
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
someone
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
its
a
little
watered
down
for
my
taste
if
i
was
looking
for
the
flavors
of
the
winter
warmer
but
a
bit
lighter
this
would
be
the
way
to
go
maybe
a
fall
warmer
d
very
crisp
not
too
complicated
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
saint
arnolds
has
done
it
again
with
this
winter
seasonal
they
still
amaze
me
at
how
good
the
beers
are
this
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
2finger
head
that
left
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
of
malts
and
a
hint
of
spice
probably
nutmeg
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
somewhat
spiced
maybe
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
has
a
malt
characteristic
to
it
also
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
fluffy
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
to
come
out
of
the
saint
arnolds
brewery
d
probably
my
favor
winter
warmer
still
something
id
only
want
a
few
times
around
the
holidays
pours
a
clear
bronze
with
a
tan
head
that
dies
completely
smells
sweet
candies
with
a
little
spice
tastes
of
sweet
malt
a
little
fruity
with
a
spicy
finish
medium
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
delicious
looks
like
a
nice
ipa
wonderful
clear
copper
with
an
easily
provoked
head
that
is
slow
to
settle
to
a
fine
layer
that
leaves
minimal
rings
as
it
progresses
down
the
glass
smells
like
sweet
malt
dme
and
piney
hops
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
but
in
opposite
order
with
some
alcohol
at
the
end
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
malty
sweetness
it
tastes
like
the
final
gravity
is
too
high
aside
from
the
alcohol
warmth
at
the
tailend
i
wouldnt
really
consider
this
a
winter
warmer
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
as
it
warms
and
opens
up
a
caramel
nuttiness
is
discernable
in
the
aftertaste
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
represent
the
style
very
well
not
really
recommended
but
not
too
bad
cant
say
too
much
negative
about
it
at
first
it
was
hard
for
me
to
detect
some
characteristics
of
this
beer
but
as
time
goes
on
i
can
make
out
more
and
more
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
really
good
winter
warmer
something
i
highly
recommend
d
this
is
an
excellent
seasonal
offering
from
saint
arnold
highly
impressed
especially
considering
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
their
ofest
according
to
their
website
this
is
an
old
ale
but
i
think
it
makes
a
better
drink
during
the
winter
atricapillafeb
20
fizzles
away
too
quickly
even
after
holding
the
bottle
several
inches
above
the
glass
the
smell
is
promising
but
unfortunately
the
taste
doesnt
quite
deliver
i
expect
a
little
more
out
of
a
seasonal
ale
such
as
this
it
definitely
has
a
little
bit
of
spice
one
should
find
in
the
style
but
not
enough
too
much
of
the
pervasive
caramel

im

and
i
see
this
in
the
local
kroger
i
dont
know
when
this
comes
out
this
beer
is
incredibly
sweet
for
some
reason
i
am
expecting
a
richness
to
this
brew
that
is
just
not
here
it
is
enjoyable
though
and
no
spices
that
i
pick
up
taste
is
minerally
although
you
can
clearly

its
not

it
is

overall
fairly
good
old
ale
with
some
nice
oak
aging
but
really
wasnt
worth
the
money
or
a
big
fancy
collaboration
but
i
did
not
lower
the
score
due
to
the
price
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
the
complexity
of
flavors
really
comes
out
nice
beer
poured
on
tap
in
a
shaker

the
beer
is
a
cloudy
muddled
opaque
caramel
brown
coloring
with
no

aromas
of
apple
candi
sugar
toffee
dates
fig
and
a

flavors
are

aftertaste
rich
slick

with
a
building

a
great
and
unique
expression
of
the

here
i
love
it
paler
in
color
than
old
ales
usually
are
without
much
head
from
the
tap
on
this
one
a
nose
of
sweet
layered
grain
cinnamon
and
sweet
oak
even
a
touch
of
raisin
or
dried
cherry
in
here
the
flavor
is
similar
with
the
toffee
grain
flavor
going
from
start
to
finish
and
the
cinnamon
and
molasses
spice
unfolding
in
the
middle
dried
fruit
is
more
date
or
fig
than
berry
or
cherry
on
the
palate
less
sweet
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
cutting
or
hot
and
i
think
that
aspect
is
really
well
designed
and
executed
the
spice
complexion
is
really
interesting
with
the
lighter
colored
but
full
bodied
and
sticky
sweet
grain
base
it
gives
it
rounder
edges
and
a
lingering
appeal
a
mellow
apple

tried
this
a
few
times
getting
better
with
age
closing
with
a
greater
sense
of
dryness
than
expected
its
sweet
taste
develops
quickly
into
a
powderyfresh
finish
equipped
with
a
broad
woodsy
hop
bitterness
wood
spice
and
the
sourastringent
interplay
suggestive
of
grape

then
finally
a
glimpse
of
dark
chocolate
in

candied
dates
raisins
deeply
caramelized
malt
toasted

and
light
floral
notes
counter
a
touch
of

flavor
reveals
a
fairly
sweet
buttery

which
becomes
dry
and
toasted

finish

i

thats

of

overtone
of
belgian
yeast
and
a
hint
of
coffee
a
very
good
beer
overall
wow
i
really
liked
this
beer
just
hits
so
many
flavors
while
remaining
a
coherent
whole
just
excellent
stuff
i
hope
i
can
find
another
bottle
somewhere
poured
into
a
snifter
brown
in
color
lighter
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
light
some
head
with
little
lace
the
nose
is
all
over
the
place
with
stronger
notes
of
vanilla
dark
fruit
with
some
apple
and
pear
and
cocoa
taking
control
here
the
taste
follows
suit
really
intense
and
layered
with
so
much
malty
depth
unpretentious
despite
its
complexity
a
big
beer
at
10
abv
but
not
overly
boozy
seriously
this
is
one
fine
beer
a
commendable
effort
from
the
fine
folks
who
made
this
possible
cheers
note
when
my
wife
and
i
first
tasted
this
beer
it
was
fridge
cold
our
fault
for
being
thirsty
and
impatient
the
beer
presents
a
strong
metallicpennyblood
flavor
when
cold
to
the
point
of
seeming
decidedly
offflavor
but
this
fades
and
is
completely
gone
by
the
time
it
gets
to
the
recommended
temperature
many
beers
served
colder
than
recommended
only
sacrifice
peak
flavor
in
my
experience
this
is
a
less
common
one
one
that
will
be
downright
off
even
to
the
point
where
you
may
be
tempted
to
write
off
the
beer
so
let
this
one
sit
on
the
counter
for
a
good
2025
minutes
if
pulling
from
a
conventional
refrigerator
you
will
not
regret
it
id
prefer
to
revisit
this
in
about
34
years
minimum
but
alas
i
doubt
theres
a
drop
of
this
beer
outside
of
anodynes
keg
low
b
o
eugh
im
halfway
torn
between
this
being
a
horrible
experiment
and
some
sort
of
brewing
fault
its
funky
herbal
and
metallic
not
sure
ive
ever
had
an
old
ale
that
tastes
anything
like
that
not
very
good
i
drain
poured

to
update
prior
quick
review
o
enjoyable
and
fairly
light
the
booze
is
hidden
well
a
great
sipper
but
nothing
to
waggle
your
penis
at
overall
a
very
good
take
on
an
old
ale
good
mix
of
bready
dryness
funk
and
fruit
notes
overall
quite
nice
really
i
enjoyed
myself
but
my
enjoyment
is
tempered
by
the
abject
sadness
of
knowing
i
only
have
this
one
lone
bottle
it
reminds
me
to
take
pleasure
in
the
simple
things
to
go
outdoors
to
go
do
something
anything
to
live
life
and
enjoy
it
for
long
of
tooth
the
description
of
this
beer
intrigued
me
old
ale
aged
on
cocoa
nibs
and
oak
sounds
great
but
you
worry
me
when
you
mention
the
brett
i
wasnt
sure
how
it
would
work
in
an
old
ale
but
i
hardly
noticed
it
at
all
my
only
issue
with
this
beer
is
that
i
like
old
ales
to
have
deep
intense
malt
character
and
to
display
good
malt
complexity
theres
too
much
going
on
here
with
all
the
fruit
notes
the
flavors
while
good
tend
to
get
muddled
i
liked
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
all
the
added
ingredients
enhanced
the
flavor
all
that
much
right
now
i
would
prefer
a
topshelf
standard
old
ale
like
north
coast
old
stock
ale
to
this
as
i
continue
to
experience
more
beers
my
tastes
might
change
and
i
might
warm
to
this
more
via
bottle
o
overall
it
say
this
is
close
to
an
english
old
ale
since
it
did
not
pick
up
on
the
coco
nibs

but
not

overall
very

but
not

about
it

pleasant
ale
overall
theakstons

and

hereabouts
its

is

as

beer
might
have
another
now
i
will
be
enjoying
this
beer
this
was
interesting
but
fell
a
tiny
bit
short
for
me
it
had
a
lot
of
potential
but
this
just
isnt
the
style
of
old
ale
i
like
o
not
a
bad
beer
would
order
again
versus
the
various
boring
beers
but
can
probably
find
a
nicer
dark
beer
out
there
overall
this
a
solid
beer
it
has
some
nice
dried
fruit
flavors
and
scents
overall
good
to
really
good
beer
a
little
more
subtle
than
many
of
the
old
ales
ive
had
but
this
is
to
be
expected
from
an
english
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
to
get
a
sense
of
the
range
of
the
style
probably
would
not
repurchase
though
o
very
nice
its
flavour
is
something
between
porter
and
barley
wine
but
its
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
both
as
i
first
poured
this
ale
into
my
pint
glass
i
was
under
the
impression
this
was
going
to
be
a
forgettable
beer
i
took
a
swig
and
as
i
set
down
the
glass
on
the
desk
i
remember
thinking
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
the
taste
started
bitter
as
you
would
expect
any
ale
to
deliver
a
little
too
bitter
if
i
am
to
be
honest
but
as
i
continued
working
at
my
desk
my
taste
buds
would
not
let
me
forget
the
lingering
bitterness
that
gave
way
to
a
sweet
finish
i
found
myself
reaching
for
the
glass
taking
another
sip
as
this
deep
red
ale
hit
my
tongue
a
second
time
i
realize
that
this
beer
holds
a
quaint
little
secret
once
again
i
set
the
glass
down
on
the
desk
but
unlike
the
first
time
i
have
a
new
respect
for
this
delicious
ale
paying
more
attention
to
the
flavor
this
time
i
realize
that
this
brew
has
a
creamy
sweet
caramel
flavor
with
a
very
nice
lingering
fruity
undertone
well
balanced
with
a
mild
bitterness
by
the
time
i
finish
the
glass
this
forgettable
beer
has
me
craving
another
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
i
will
not
soon
be
forgetting
this
premium
ale
o
fresh
i
guess
is
the
way
to
go
with
this
one
my
ratings
are
based
on
a
fresh
beer
from
brewery
few
days
old
arent
they
always
better
that
way
not
big
on
english
beers
but
this
is
nice
this
beer
tastes
exactly
what
an
old
ale
should
taste
very
flavorful
and
deep
but
smooth
at
the
same
time
overall
a
really
lovely
example
of
old
ale
that
calls
to
mind
fullers
esb
proof
that
it
is
possible
to
bet
a
lot
of
flavor
without
a
lot
of
alcohol
i
really
liked
this
ale
and
will
be
getting
more
in
next
time
prost
no
doubt
this
is
brewed
in
england
a
very
traditional
tasting
ale
with
some
minor
oxidation
flaws
but
its
to
be
expected
from
an
import
nice
fruit
notes
with
some
hops
still
hanging
in
there
the
yeast
really
shows
up
and
adds
a
bready
doughy
character
would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
in
england
super
drinkable
with
nice
english
flavors
a
true
classic
and
very
good
needless
to
say
that
if
you
havent
tried
this
ale
try
it
now
cheers
the
taste
is
also
incredibly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
low
to
moderate
bitterness
at
the
finish
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
in
about
two
years
since
it
briefly
left
the
us
and
it
does
not
seem
to
have
lost
its
uniqueness
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
was
not
so
impressed
its
an
overall
nice
beer
with
decent
complexity
and
a
bit
of
a
barleywine
feel
but
really
just
nothing
outstanding

in

only
a
fleeting
rise

against
a
somewhat
bold

potent

aromas

almost

quality

and
apparent
flemish

oxidized
lightly
sour
tinge
in
the
aftertaste
despite
hints
of
syrupy
chewiness
initially
it
lightens
up
enough
early
on
not
to
tire
the
palate
though
it
retains
a
consistent
bold
malty
dextrinous
texture
without
viscosity
littletono
alcohol
presence
at
any
stage
not
bad
at
all
overall
though
a
bit
of
a
letdown
ill
certainly
try
it
on
the
pump
if
i
ever
come
across
it
o
an
average
ale
that
lacks
real
flavour
seems
fairly
flat
and
rather
disappointing
o
an
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
a
nice
way
to
end
the
day
o
a
very
good
flavorful
beer
that
will
work
good
as
both
session
and
dessert
beer
overall
dont
let
the
look
of
this
beer
or
the
name
deceive
you
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
a
beer
only
the
english
could
brew
my
only
issue
with
this
beer
is
that
it
seems
to
be
completely
devoid
of
hops
and
a
little
lacking
of
character

much

lot
of

to
it
and
balanced
really
well
to
make
really
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ill
have
to
try
more
old
ales
to
decide
what
i
think
of
the
style
this
brew
doesnt
want
to
make
me
give
up
my
love
for
the
english
pale
ale
but
its
awfully
interesting
like
a
gateway
beer
to
guinness
get
out
there
and
try
old
peculier
not
only
is
the
name
different
but
the
beer
will
make
you
say
hmmm
life
is
too
short
not
to
go
hmmm
dont
waste
it
on
beer
that
makes
you
go
pppttt
conclusion
this
is
fantastic
maybe
i
was
born
to
drink
english
beer
but
i
just
love
this
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
an
old
ale
save
for
a
maybe
a
slight
lack
of
tart
but
who
can
get
nitpicky
with
such
a
fantastic
and
iconic
beer
o
enjoyable
aromatics
but
its
just
okay
otherwise
though
to
be
fair
this
isnt
my
style
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
o
flavors
are
more
subtle
than
american
old
ales
the
focus
is
on
malt
with
the
hops
only
coming
through
at
the
finish
its
a
filling
and
satisfying
beer
notes
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
quite
a
long
time
ago
in
a
bottle
then
last
october
in
england
on
tap
now
again
in
a
bottle
and
its
absolutely
incredible
a
great
ale
and
tasty
o
since
the
overall
abv
is
not
too
high
as
it
can
sometimes
be
in
the
old
ale
style
and
the
body
is
not
quite
as
full
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
there
are
nice
flavors
and
the
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
which
makes
this
one
quite
enjoyable
o
i
remember
this
as
a
much
smoother
and
stronger
beer
when
i
discovered
it
in
the
early
90s
especially
when
i
had
it
in
europe
at
that
time
on
draught
it
was
nearly
a
religious
experience
this
bottled
version
is
not
nearly
the
beer
i
remember
not
my
cup
of
tea
erm
bottle
of
ale
smell
is
nice
but
taste
is
very
strong
too
much
licorice
for
mee
drink
well
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
and
it
just
didnt
pan
out
cant
win
em
all
just
not
what
i
was
thinking
it
was
and
then
blended
too
many
styles
together
for
me
food
match
complimenting
this
with
a
christmas
cake
would
be
a
real
treat
main
course
chargrilled
pork
ribs
roast
kale
and
grilled
mediterranean
vegetables
yes
something
of
a
disappointment
for
me
though
i
certainly
dont
hate
it
its
just
a
bit
too
restrained
for
me
and
what
i
expect
out
of
this
style
maybe
it
was
the
bottle
i
dont
know
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
a
little
hazy
with
some
nice
tight
head
that
leaves
lacing
on
the
sides
of
glass
smells
of
molasses
and
dark
fruit
such
as
dark
cherries
apricot
has
some
brown
sugar
notes

great

old

wish
i
had
more
of
this
in
the
dead
of
winter
o
easydrinking
ale
very
british
recommended
o
overall
a
very
mellow
beer
perhaps
a
little
too
mellow
to
the
point
of
being
slightly
lacking
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
an
old
ale
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
this
beer
pours
black
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
licorice
and
anise
fairly
plain
the
flavor
leads
off
with
anise
followed
by
a
licorice
and
peppery
finish
ordinary
its
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
bit
watery
for
the
style
theakston
old

is
an
average
beer
recommended
o
ok
beer
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
caramel
flavour
but
when
i
had
it
with
orange
chocolate
it
intensified
the
flavour
of
the
chocolate
very
nice

held

light
an
interesting
maroon
comes
through
it
smells
complex
with

vanilla
cocoa
and
cola
the
tast
mirrors
the
smell
and
has
a
substantial
malt
finish
gets
yeasty
in
the
end
very
nice
over
all
and
its
not
the
beer
which
is
peculiar

all

drinkability
exceptional
this
stuff
makes
you
want
to
get
another
drink
as
soon
as
the
first
sip
leaves
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
tried
this
would
be
an
amazing
session
brew
a
great
old
ale
a
classic
its
very
similar
to
the
granite
brewery
version
the
did
a
good
job
emulating
this
the
aroma
is
malts
sweet
booze
and
dark
fruit
the
appearancew
is
an
attractive
redbrown
minimal
head
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
caramel
and
toffee
the
palate
was
also
sweet
but
with
a
nice
subtle
touch
of
bittering
hops
thick
mouthfeel
this
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
porter
or
a
stout
nice
beer
overall
much
less
impressive
on
bottle
short
and
crippled
dead
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
offering
it
is
not
bad
just
uninspired
and
bland
d
could
easily
go
another
one
cannot
wait
to
try
some
more
pours
a
very
deep
hearty
red
color
doesnt
seem
to
be
too
much
aroma
wise
hence
it
getting
my
lowest
score
taste
wise
its
very
interesting
first
gulp
is
of
malts
as
it
goes
down
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
which
lingers
for
a
while
definitely
not
expected
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
must
say
id
definitely
try
it
again
d
this
is
a
definite
oneatatime
beer
it
tasted
great
but
is
a
little
of
the
sweet
side
and
i
could
see
myself
getting
sick
of
it
if
i
had
too
many
at
once
d
old
pseculiar
a
pretty
unique
beer
very
tasty
very
enjoyable
not
really
a
session
beer
but
i
cant
say
i
would
ever
turn
one
of
these
down
d
very
drinkable
for
an
old
ale
while
most
old
ales
are
superb
for
sipping
this
one
is
on
the
verge
of
sessionability
yes
sessionability
the
flavors
while
not
over
the
top
are
definitely
there
to
make
it
an
excellent
experience
and
definitely
worth
trying
once
if
not
falling
head
over
heels
for
in
the
end
a
lot
of
character
and
a
superior
balance
make
this
a
real
treat
seek
out
the
old
peculier
at
bars
and
liquor
stores
and
stock
up
a
bit
i
hope
to
see
this
on
draft
somewhere
stateside
but
might
be
out
of
luck
oh
well
id
better
enjoy
this
one
d
easily
drinkable
but
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
a
bit
more
maltiness
would
have
been
great
and
balanced
out
the
oak
perhaps
my
bottle
was
old
would
i
have
it
again
possibly
my
idea
of
old
ale
is
more
like
north
coast
brewings
version
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
prototype
but
i
was
not
that
impressed
after
all
of
that
why
the
lower
drinkability
rating
this
is
not
a
session
beer
wonderful
flavors
scent
texture
everything
masterful
in
structure
but
hard
to
do
more
than
2
in
a
row
all
around
pretty
good
bitterness
and
heavy
carbonation
make
it
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
however
had
some
friends
who
always
talk
about
how
peculier
the
old
peculier
is
with
a
name
like
that
youre
asking
for
it
lets
see
for
ourselves
a
very
deep
dark
brown
brew
with
a
quickly
fading
dark
tan
head
no
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
of
molasses
nuts
and
some
dark
fruits
such
as
raisins
theres
also
a
boozy
essence
involved
tastes
a
bit
sweet
and
nutty
up
front
with
some
smokey
malts
in
the
middle
and
spice
and
alcohol
in
the
back
medium
to
full
bodied
carbonation
is
fairly
active
and
quick
the
old
peculier
is
a
bit
different
but
in
a
good
way
a
beer
i
first
tried
out
of
a
cask
at
the
old
dungeon
ghyll
hotel
in
the
lake
district
far
too
many
years
ago
im
very
happy
to
know
that
op
is
still
a
damn
fine
beer
in
the
bottle
i
find
it
a
little
too
carbonated
but
aroma
taste
and
enjoyment
hardly
suffer
for
it
very
wellbalanced
with
an
understated
malty
sweetness
and
a
nice
finish
that
shouldnt
offend
anyone
who
doesnt
like
that
hit
of
hops
as
their
beer
slides
down
the
back
of
their
throat
a
very
easy
and
very
pleasurable
beer
to
drink
the
beer
is
not
heavy
or
tiring
to
drink
but
what
flavor
there
is
comes
across
as
pretty
simple
and
one
dimensional
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
it
will
probably
be
some
time
before
i
order
it
again
there
are
just
too
many
other
interesting
beers
out
there
very
dark
and
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
brown
head
faint
malty
earthy
smell
faint
rumlike
alcohol
tastes
of
sweet
roasted
chocolate
malt
with
a
bit
of
earthy
funk
not
too
thick
moderate
mouthfeel
sorry
this
review
is
short
but
this
beer
is
actually
rather
simple
not
overly
flavorful
which
is
just
fine
reminds
me
of
xingu
i
guess
light
dark
fruit
shows
up
as
it
warms
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
dark
fruit
smells
are
glorious
smells
like
en
epa
mixed
with
a
dark
belgian
ale
hops
come
though
in
the
taste
to
balance
out
the
malt
there
is
an
interesting
earthiness
to
this
brew
moderate
feel
and
incredible
drinkability
at
5
7
i
think
i
would
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
very
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
in
the
glass
with
a
thinnish
tan
head
that
laces
a
bit
the
smell
is
dark
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
and
light
chocolatecoffee
tones
that
are
sweet
not
astringent
there
is
also
a
bit
of
light
flowery
hop
and
even
some
slightly
funky
earthy
tones
the
taste
starts
out
as
creamy
sweet
malts
and
rum
soaked
fruits
this
quickly
gives
way
to
more
bitter
hops
and
roasted
grain
the
finish
is
never
ending
coarse
grain
alcohol
spice
and
hoppy
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
overlay
the
mouthfeel
is
good
super
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
great
flavors
that
linger
forever
and
invite
the
next
sip
overall
a
good
beer
satisfying
whether
you
drink
just
one
or
plan
on
a
small
session
there
is
nothing
peculiar
about
it
this
just
a
good
beer
overall
a
decent
brew
interesting
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
worth
a
try
m
d
light
carbonation
medium
to
full
body
and
quite
refreshing
on
the
finish
with
an
alcohol
content
on
the
lighter
side
it
is
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
a
few
at
a
time
with
all
the
flavours
of
some
bigger
brews
perhaps
not
a
summer
day
drinker
exactly
or
maybe
it
is
depending
on
what
you
like
but
a
very
good
every
day
beer
could
reasonably
be
sessionable
for
a
nice
afternoon
out
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
purplishred
a
fingers
worth
of
foam
that
recedes
rather
quickly
leaving
behind
little
lacing
smell
is
very
fruity
up
front
with
hints
of
apple
smells
almost
like
a
bsda
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
barely
any
hop
presence
but
the
fruity
malts
with
hints
of
sourness
and
a
bit
of
roastiness
mingle
nicely
keeps
getting
sweeter
as
it
warms
hints
of
raisins
some
earthiness
pops
up
and
quickly
leaves
it
sounds
strange
but
im
picking
some
hints
of
grape
soda
weird
but
interesting
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
light
to
medium
bodied
an
overall
nice
brew
and
my
first
of
this
style
i
would
greatly
like
to
try
some
more
old
ales
in
the
future
i
cant
wait
to
have
an
assortment
of
meats
and
cheeses
with
this
classic
english
brew
d
a
very
good
brew
it
seems
to
pack
more
of
a
punch
than
most
beers
in
this
alcohol
range
id
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
and
see
how
they
compare
a
great
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
revisited
and
will
again
d
this
is
a
very
nice
old
ale
very
complex
flavors
an
excellent
brew
too
bad
it
took
me
so
long
to
revisit
this
mfd
creamy
with
good
enough
carbonation
to
give
your
tongue
a
slight
sizzle
overall
a
good
session
ale
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
for
an
old
ale
i
am
surprised
at
how
light
this
beer
is
thats
not
a
bad
thing
especially
when
consuming
it
in
warmer
weather
very
pleasant
mellow
aroma
of
chocolate
and
honey
or
maple
not
very
bubbly
nice
and
tasty
not
too
toasty
not
overly
malty
and
ever
so
slightly
bitter
all
in
all
a
pleasant
surprise
lovely
mahogany
color
a
good
dark
beer
to
try
on
those
who
might
normally
shy
away
from
such
things
worth
repeating
d
this
is
pretty
easy
drinking
but
it
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
and
i
didnt
care
too
much
for
the
mouthfeel
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
beautiful
head
which
lingered
nicely
for
a
while
before
it
settled
to
the
rim
the
initial
taste
is
a
smooth
malty
sensation
that
will
have
you
going
back
for
more
and
the
finish
just
reinforces
what
can
only
be
described
as
an
immideiate
affection
i
love
this
beer
d
its
not
surprise
that
a
beer
that
tastes
this
good
is
very
drinkable
only
drawback
is
that
ill
be
sad
when
its
gone
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
i
may
try
to
find
a
newer
bottle
to
judge
better
on
its
drinkability
this
is
something
that
i
would
definitely
seek
out
in
a
six
pack
and
not
just
buy
a
bottle
every
once
in
a
while
it
seems
best
suited
for
spring
or
autumn
nights
nothing
so
thick
that
itd
warm
you
up
while
its
snowing
out
but
not
quite
the
refresher
youd
want
while
grilling
on
a
hot
sunny
day
pours
a
musky
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
laces
quite
well
nose
does
work
with
a
load
of
brown
sugar
cinnamon
the
palate
is
very
bakerysugary
with
dark
bread
covered
in
yeast
great
initial
entry
but
midfinish
leaves
a
watery
mouthfeel
with
sugar
the
beer
isnt
overly
sweet
so
its
quite
sessionable
decent
at
best
dark
and
cloudy
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
this
beer
was
fairly
interesting
it
had
a
flavor
of
dark
malts
caramel
coffee
dark
fruit
and
a
strange
vegetablelike
quality
almost
like
celery
the
feel
was
a
little
syrupy
not
bad
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
tangy
which
hurts
the
drinkability
my
wife
knocked
into
my
glass
with
her
purse
and
spilled
some
beer
on
my
hand
and
it
glued
my
fingers
together
solid
pour
into
my
pint
glass
it
appears
dark
murky
brown
almost
as
dark
as
a
porter
and
on
top
forms
a
2
cm
thick
head
of
foam
aroma
is
mild
and
pleasant
dark
malts
yeast
toffee
and
a
whiff
of
rubbing
alcohol
the
taste
is
bolder
than
i
was
expecting
darker
brown
ale
dark
pale
ale
the
two
together
mild
yeast
flavor
sweet
and
very
well
balanced
a
fine
ale
indeed
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
light
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
with
some
lace
that
faded
also
smells
of
dark
fruits
prunes
raisins
toffee
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
roasted
malt
fruity
rock
candy
and
toffee
weak
watery
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
was
also
weak
if
i
saw
something
better
i
would
pass
on
this
one
d
this
stuff
is
excellent
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
its
not
really
heavy
at
all
for
such
a
dark
beer
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
beer
is
incredible
this
one
would
be
wonderful
after
dinner
or
when
hanging
out
with
some
friends
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
this
is
one
of
my
fathers
favorite
brews
and
i
see
why
the
beer
smells
dark
roast
and
some
sweetness
in
the
vein
of
the
dark
fruits
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
complex
flavour
it
has
fruit
then
a
cream
flavour
then
a
dark
roasted
taste
this
beer
is
fucking
solid
the
flavours
constantly
change
on
your
tongue
its
so
god
damn
balanced
its
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
but
it
works
for
the
beer
i
could
easily
drink
many
of
these
drinkbility
is
good
this
is
a
mild
brew
that
harnesses
the
qulaities
of
the
flavors
present
and
creates
a
solid
composition
that
is
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
old
ale
drinkability
pretty
good
the
taste
is
very
interesting
i
was
preparing
myself
to
not
anticipate
anything
peculier
from
this
beer
but
its
name
is
fitting
i
dont
know
quite
what
to
make
of
it
its
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
i
had
this
one
at
a
bar
a
few
weeks
ago
got
one
to
try
pours
a
deep
garnetbrown
w
a
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing

strong

stand

only
slightly

a
slightly

about

finishes
well
w

undertone
a
lightmed

and

make
this
one
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
thin
a
decent
brew
for
sure
ill
have
to
get
some
more
of
these
next
time
i
beer
shop
d
quite
a
unique
beer
that
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
good
with
hearty
food
id
only
do
two
of
these
in
one
session
d
not
bad
drank
this
on
a
friends
recomondation
it
was
plesant
but
i
was
hopeing
for
a
little
more
substance
md
rich
creamy
and
smooth
a
nice
easy
beer
to
sip
on
very
dark
brown
with
reddish
glints
in
the
light
quite
clear
aroma
of
molasses
and
fruity
malt
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
sweetness
evident
here
molasses
and
chocolate
hints
its
not
overdone
and
balanced
with
some
darker
notes
complexity
and
a
lingering
bitter
component
excellent
with
blue
cheese
for
savoring
rather
than
glugging

great
ale
very
enjoyable

like

though
malty

very
drinkable
and
could
be
a

recommended
overall
this
was

nothing

nothing

about

refreshing
and
enjoyable
but
more
of
an

at

but
thats
the
only
time
you
can
almost

maybe
a
good

beer
i
dont
know
why
this
rates
so
high
maybe
i
got
a
bad
sample
because
this
shares
very
few
characteristics
that
are
highly
praised
by
other
reviewers
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
nothing
particularly
interesting
or
outstanding
but
a
very
solid
brew
tasty
light
drinkable
dont
know
much
about
old
ales
but
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
classic
i
can
drink
a
bunch
of
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
solid
taste
and
isnt
quite
as
heavy
as
you
might
think
by
looking
at
it
i
could
drink
this
quite
often
but
its
a
bit
hard
to
find
around
these
parts
d
this
beer
impresses
me
manages
to
be
just
big
enough
to
warm
but
not
so
big
as
to
lose
the
subtleties
that
can
make
a
beer
worth
contemplating
wish
to
revisit
frequently
a
very
old
school
british
beer
seems
a
bit
quaint
compared
to
todays
penchant
for
big
beers

fisheyes
color

a
dark

brown

faint
sweet
and
bready
first
taste
is
a
nice
toasted
sweetness
there
is
a
very
malted
and
bready
character
to
it
with
a
crisp
carbonation
the
flavor
fades
fast
ending
on
almost
a
metalic
copper
note
one
of
my
favorite
english
ales
this
beer
pours
a
dark
blackishbrown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
slowly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
with
lots
of
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
has
more
caramel
than
the
aroma
with
a
long
lasting
toffee
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
again
behind
a
lot
of
hops
or
alcohol
very
dark
reddish
just
a
few
shades
from
black
decent
head
if
you
give
it
a
vigorous
pour
smell
is
very
subtle
you
really
have
you
get
your
nose
right
up
to
it
to
detect
it
mostly
just
the
tells
of
a
sweet
ale
but
some
kind
of
interesting
fruit
underneath
it
all
that
fruit
which
becomes
apparant
in
the
taste
reminds
me
the
most
of
lovely
overripe
plum
a
sharp
and
short
bite
of
hops
and
alcohol
follow
leaving
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
roasted
malt
lingering
at
the
end
faint
diacetyl
that
doesnt
get
in
the
way
too
much
not
an
incredibly
complex
ale
but
more
so
than
the
average
british
beer
on
the
shelf
drinkabilitys
fine
a
solid
choice
like
the
embers
of
a
dying
fire
this
one
gives
a
slow
even
comforting
warmth
not
from
the
alcohol
but
from
its
color
balance
and
general
richness
tales
of
its
stature
on
cask
leave
me
daydreaming
of
finding
myself
in
a
yorkshire
pub
someday
pours
dark

the
head
is
rather
light
in
both
color
and

it

is

initially
followed
by
a
slight

a

one
for

fuggles
a

yummy
long
finish
on
this
one
actualyl
a
light
hop
character
there
and
some
dry
maltiness
as
well
as
th
roast
quintessential
example
of
lighter
version
of
old
ale
drinkability
was
excellent
especially
for
this
dark
english
beer
definitely
would
drink
this
one
again
and
buy
some
to
cellar
if
i
had
easy
access
to
6packs
of
this
overall
a
truly
excellent
job
pours
a
very
lovely
deep

when
not
held
to

it
looks
like
a
deep
brown
not
muchof
a

very
swee
malty
fruity
aroma
greets
my
nose
notes
of
sugared
figs
and
oher
candied
fruits
bring
up
a
great
malt
nose
the
taste
is
a
very
complex
malt
bill
with
just
enough
hops
to
not
make
this
beer
taste
like
candy
syrup
hints
f
prunes
bown
sugar
and
fruit
cake
mixed
with
roasted
malts
great
feel
to
this
palate
smooth
and
sweet
hard
to
be
very
sessionable
though
because
of
the
sweetness
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
nose
is
almost
like
smoky
wood
touch
of
caramel
in
there
flavor
is
extremely
smooth
a
bit
lighter
than
some
old
ales
out
there
but
still
carries
a
nice
slight
woody
character
to
it
smooth
caramel
flavor
there
more
like
caramel
out
of
the
heart
of
a
tree
feel
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
feel
overall
this
one
is
very
drinkable
not
the
most
complex
old
ale
by
any
means
but
definitely
smooth
and
well
made

good

overall
i
was
impressed
im
not
a
fan
of
true
english
beer
yet
found
it
quite
tasty
i
did
not
have
any
trouble
getting
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
would
not
hesitate
drinking
another
if
i
had

even
go
so
far
as

food
pairings
that

very
good
job
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
purplish
red
highlights
and
next
to
no
head
the
beer
smells
of
malts
and
perhaps
a
few
subtle
fruity
notes
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
malts
and
finishing
with
some
dark
fruity
raisins
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
i
would
consider
this
beer
to
be
fairly
drinkable
and
could
see
myself
possibly
reaching
for
another
d
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
for
a
lower

beer
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
havent
had
the
peculier
for
probably
three
years
i
wish
i
hadnt
waited
so
long
even
though
this
is
vastly
different
than
what
i
normally
drink
it
has
a
good

i

perhaps
the

it

should
be
considered
a
good
middle
of
the

and
not

malty

some

a
wonderful
beer
sweet
pretty
hoppy
for
an
old
ale
more
like
a
strong
apa
not
a
hoppy
beer
guy
overall
this
is
not
one
of
my
preferred
beers
from
southern
tier
or
in
general
in
fact
it
just
has
too
much
hoppy
bitterness
for
my
tastes
hop
heads
should
love
it
though
nice
color
good
mouth
feel
good
tasting
without
a
bunch
of
overpowering
spiciness
to
muck
up
the
experience
one
of
my
top
5
christmas
beers
its
a
must
have
every
year
t
rich
malts
dark
fruit
and
toffee
and
nuts
citrusy
hops
again
i
am
confused
by
southern
tier
with
the
styling
of
this
seasonal
ale
it
taste
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
ale
i
had
this
problem
with
their
krampus
beer
as
well
infact
i
am
having
trouble
separating
the
taste
of
this
and
krampus
they
taste
way
too
similar
in
my
opinion
anyway
this
is
the
second
sampling
from
southern
tier
that
is
a
good
beer
but
i
am
not
tasting
anything
different
or
distinguishable
they
all
taste
like
ipas
even
though
they
are
supposed
to
be
a
different
style
i
am
not
saying
that
this
old
man
is
a
bad
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
i
find
it
to
be
very
bitter
and
hoppy
which
i
like
i
wouldnt
call
it
an
ale
or
old
ale
though
i
guess
my
expectation
from
this
company
is
to
always
blow
me
away
since
my
first
two
southern
tier
samplings
were
their
pumking
and
warlock
which
are
phenomenal
this
is
a
solid
beer
if
you
like
hoppy
bitter
beers
with
all
the
characteristics
of
an
ipa
i
just
wished
for
more
of
a
creamy
ale
o
not
what
it
is
advertised
as
but
an
ok
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
close
to
being
an
average
example
of
the
style
i
know
this
style
always
doesnt
have
to
be
on
the
stronger
side
but
i
felt
like
this
beer
was
missing
some
of
that
complexity
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
when
it
came
down
to
it
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
too
memorable
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
watery
pretty
crisp
slight
prickly
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
great
job
of
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
any
more
than
that
and
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
this
was
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
that
it
was
jut
a
little
bland
and
not
to
memorable
those
aspects
held
this
beer
back
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
good
old
ale
but
it
may
be
worth
a
try
to
see
what
you
think
of
it
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
it
didnt
really
have
anything
that
made
it
stick
out
to
me
and
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
how
an
ipa
tastes
when
it
get
too
old
without
that
stale
malt
aspect
this
one
was
falls
right
in
the
middle
for
southern
tier
and
its
very
average
for
an
old
ale
i
just
wasnt
that
into
this
beer
better
luck
next
time
guys
far
too
bitter
for
my
liking
much
better
winter
ales
out
there
this
just
hit
me
as
really
damn
good
nice
deep
amber
in
the
glass
and
nice
hints
of
pine
on
the
nose
many
of
the
same
notes
imho
as
brown
shugga
just
not
as
sweet
or
strong
really
set
off
a
nice
winter
evening
with
the
wife
i
am
really
glad
i
tried
this
one
nice
beer
to
start
out
but
has
a
bitter
ending
to
it
that
i
am
not
sure
can
be
equated
to
the
hops
had
better
winter
warmers
from
local
breweries
no
need
to
keep
this
middle
of
the
road
example
from
across
the
country
bad
after
taste
overall
drinkability
overall
this
isnt
like
any
old
ale
ive
had
the
hops
and
malts
play
very
nicely
together
but
id
have
a
hard
time
calling
this
an
old
ale
maybe
a
very
hoppy
amber
or
just
an
apa
with
some
unique
malt
hop
combos
so
while
overall
it
isnt
an
old
ale
to
style
it
is
a
beer
that
grew
on
me
over
the
course
of
the
glass
it
went
quite
well
with
food
pork
chops
with
roasted
potatoes
sweet
potatoes
and
by
itself
was
rather
tasty
i
think
if
another
one
was
offered
id
probably
take
it
telling
me
its
drinkability
is
actually
pretty
good
and
dangerously
so
at
7
abv
i
feel
like
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
but
serving
it
as
an
old
ale
is
just
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
me
it
has
some
old
ale
characteristics
but
to
me
it
drinks
like
a
balanced
sweet
amber
that
being
said
the
interplay
between
the
toasted
sweet
malts
and
the
hops
is
pulled
off

nicely

nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
southern
tier
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
they
produce
some
to
quality
brews
but
this
old
ale
was
an
ipa
in
disguise
maybe
i
need
to
try
so
more
old
ales
to
make
sure
im
not
confused
nonetheless
its
a
great
beer
note
beeradvocate
has
this
incorrectly
classified
as
an
old
ale
if
it
were
this
rating
would
be
even
lower
as
it
bears
absolutely
no
resemblance
to
an
old
ale
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
deep
amber
color
and
a
light
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
initially
dominated
by
caramel
and
sweet
bread
with
the
woodsy
earthy
hop
profile
being
comparatively
soft
at
first
but
the
hop
aromatics
become
more
dominant
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
similarly
rich
and
malty
but
wellbalanced
by
the
mildlyastringent
woodsy
hops
i
would
say
that
the
taste
is
crisp
but
not
in
a
refreshing
way
rather
it
tastes
like
standing
outside
at
night
after
a
new
snow
the
mouthfeel
has
a
solid
somewhat
resinous
feel
with
a
fine
soft
carbonation
that
lifts
the
flavors
up
rather
than
obscuring
them
overall
this
beer
is
hearty
and
flavorful
without
being
overly
assertive
or
syrupy
making
a
nice
complement
to
cool
winter
weather
southern
tier
old
man
winter
ale
45
rjt
o
a
good
winter
warmer
not
great
but
good
none
the
less
oi
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
hoppy
for
an
old
ale
and
not
as
much
malt
flavor
this
is
not
a
sticky
thick
old
ale
that
coats
the
mouth
and
finishes
with
an
whisp
of
alcohol
really
belongs
in
the
red
ale
category
if
you
are
looking
for
a
real
old
ale
look
elsewhere
but
its
a
fine
beer
thats
unoffending
rather
than
a
wow
beer
put
it
this
way
if
i
saw
this
at
a
holiday
party
id
be
thrilled
to
not
have
to
drink
bud
the
problem
is
if
i
want
an
old
ale
this
aint
it
ill
get
a
4pack
of
old
stock
for
almost
the
same
price
other
than
that
celebration
is
a
cheaperbetter
beer
i
dont
see
a
reason
to
buy
this
again
o
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
picked
it
up
because
it
was
the
only
beer
down
to
one
bottle
and
it
turns
out
that
wasnt
a
bad
call
not
a
favorite
but
if
i
was
having
a
big
christmas
gathering
i
might
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
varietys
sake
overall
this
is
the
lowest
abv
old
ale
ive
had
in
fact
i
think
its
the
only
one
under
10
but
it
still
holds
up
pretty
well
against
its
highgravity
brethren
good
flavor
and
still
that
7
isnt
anything
to
sneeze
at
and
a
few
of
these
will
certainly
warm
you
up
on
a
winters
night
this
is
my
second
time
and
it
is
better
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
ale
with
some
surprising
complexity
overall
i
like
this
beer
got
a
case
last
year
after
digging
my
six
pack
so
much
it
really
isnt
a
traditional
old
ale
but
its
good
and
worth
a
try
and
it
fits
the
season
well
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
its
flavoring
while
the
aroma
was
nice
and
fruity
it
gave
way
to
a
much
more
complex
and
bittered
with
bite
and
metallic
grittiness
to
the
bone
all
the
while
the
fruit
was
echoing
across
the
top
but
dynamically
and
not
as
strongly
as
the
nose
would
suggest
this
is
not
what
we
would
classify
as
your
typical
old
ale
but
it
did
show
strength
of
musk
and
depth
to
the
grain
bill
throughout
this
is
one
of
southern
tiers
last
majorline
beers
for
us
to
rate
and
we
feel
it
fits
the
pedigree
well
weve
probably
been
avoiding
this
guy
in
particular
for
so
long
on
account
of
some
local
friends
warning
us
away
from
it
but
as
locals
ourselves
we
will
stand
by
this
beer
as
a
decent
upstate
seasonal
o
this
would
be
great
if
i
could
pick
up
more
distinct
flavors
but
at
least
with
this
bottle
its
a
no
go
ill
certainly
be
revisiting
it
next
year
to
see
if
this
is
vintage
or
bottle
variation
atmosphere
is
really
nice
really
nice
foamy
head
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
bitter
and
pungent
a
little
hoppy
with
earthy
roasted
malt
grains
ans
some
bitter
pecan
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
in
my
opinion
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
why
not
call
this
a
strong
ale
this
was
a
cheerful
winter
ale
that
wasnt
a
spice
bomb
the
spices
were
light
and
the
bread
never
ended
the
hops
gave
it
a
vibrance
and
it
drank
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
pretty
nice
and
before
you
know
it
you
will
have
had
3
or
4
of
these
old
man
winter
ale
poured
a
orangeish
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
only
really
distinct
note
in
the
aroma
was
the
malt
i
could
not
detect
any
sense
of
spiciness
or
notes
typical
of
a
winter
ale
in
the
taste
one
gets
notes
of
orange
some
mild
spice
and
alcohol
for
a
winter
beer
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thin
the
finish
was
a
tart
malty
after
that
brings
a
fairly
bland
winter
ale
to
a
head
i
love
winter
ales
but
will
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
o
not
bad
but
its
best
cold
thats
for
sure
as
it
warms
up
it
gets
over
the
top
with
sweetness
and
you
really
pick
up
the
bourbon
smell
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
but
still
a
decent
winter
beer
o
nice
take
on
the
style
the
7
0
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
one
represents
the
style
well
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
and
something
that
would
warm
the
heart
on
even
the
coldest
of
winter
eves
recommended
pretty
nice
beer
wow
some
not
so
good
comments
on
this
brew
i
am
an
ipa
and
a
englishscottish
ale
fan
i
am
definitely
an
amateur
with
all
the
lingo
however
i
know
what
i
like
old
man
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
you
will
not
be
disappointed
with
it
has
a
brownish
tint
with
a
light
head
but
who
care
it
is
taste
and
abv
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
beer
as
it
has
a
little
darker
taste
tad
bit
floral
but
not
so
much
then
follows
with
that
of
a
warming
alcohol
what
better
feel
do
you
need
for
winter
time
perfect
only
thing
better
would
be
a
skull
splitter
lacks
the
character
of
an
old
ale
minus
the
booze
pretty
lackluster
and
more
bitter
than
anticipated
just
hot
and
bitter
o
this
is
a
solid
old
ale
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
it
should
i
think
this
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
just
some
grains
and
slight
hops
in
the
aroma
but
nothing
too
fancy
there
are
some
floral
tones
and
spices
in
the
flavor
a
decent
overall
texture
as
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
bitter
taste
it
has
a
kind
of
dry
taste
overall
that
gives
a
unique
tasting
experience
this
is
my
first
old
ale
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
this
is
pretty
good
however
to
ward
off
the
cold
this
beer
does
nicely
it
really
delivers
a
good
hoppy
brew
and
i
feel
that
it
deserves
a
solid
45
overall
another
great
tasting
brew
from
southern
tier
clean
tastes
good
hop
and
bitterness
profile
a
nice
winter
take
on
the
hopped
up
beer
and
a
unique
take
on
the
old
ale
style
maybe
more
clean
and
hoppy
than
i
would
have
expected
but
a
solid
brew
o
nicely
bitter
for
an
an
old
ale
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
and
peppery
phenols
in
nose
many
of
southern
tiers
beer
caters
to
the
hops
lover
and
this
is
one
is
no
different
but
mostly
just
the
bitterness
i
has
a
good
hops
bitterness
but
still
manages
to
be
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
though
no
where
near
as
sweet
as
most
old
ales
odifferent
style
than
many
other
winter
beers
big
and
full
flavor
that
is
very
drinkable
personal
rate
4
o
very
solid
option
for
the
season
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
a
well
hopped
not
spiced
or
overly
sweet
winter
seasonal
there
is
a
well
balanced
blend
of
piney
citrus
sweet
hops
and
subtle
toasted
malts
that
make
this
a
wonderful
winter
ale
overall
i
really
like
the
flavors
in
this
beer
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
winter
pine
forest
and
makes
for
a
good
cold
weather
beer
nice
to
see
an
old
ale
being
made
by
an
american
brewery
a
nice
winter
warmer
sweet
and
malty
not
to
the
point
where
its
undrinkable
in
fact
its
quite
enjoyable
a
roasted
nutty
characteristic
that
satisfies
the
slight
want
for
bitterness
overall
a
pretty
decent
winter
ale
it
was
a
good
blend
of
spice
roast
and
hop
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
o
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
would
definitely
poor
another
oops
just
did
i
enjoy
the
way
that
the
taste
is
not
overly
complex
and
changes
significantly
from
the
front
to
back
it
may
be
the
gravity
of
beers
i
drink
but
i
find
the
alcohol
tones
fairly
laid
back
though
you
still
get
a
nice
warming
in
the
tummy
unlike
other
southern
tier
products
i
am
not
rushing
out
to
get
lots
more
of
this
but
it
is
a
commendable
brew
that
i
intend
to
buy
again
a
beer
i
like
to
enjoy
once
or
twice
a
season
i
feel
like
it
always
throws
me
for
a
curveball
well
done
and
drinkable
as
long
as
your
limit
is
one
a
little
too
sweet
and
hot
to
have
more
really
good
brew
solid
flavor
a
little
different
from
the
normal
and
highly
drinkable
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
winter
warmer
than
an
old
ale
however
o
an
average
old
ale
and
just
that
still
i
enjoy
the
style
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
another
tasty
southern
tier
beverage
this
brewery
is
not
one
to
disappoint
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
somewhat
genredefying
in
its
hop
character
but
overall
its
a
very
tasty
beer
i
would
gladly
have
again
the
hops
have
mellowed
bigtime
but
still
leave
a
nice
resinous
semibitter
aftertaste
i
can
taste
both
red
and
white
grapes
not
what
was
expected
very
drinkable
for
the
style
not
sweet
only
a
little
sticky
its
too
juicy
leaves
me
wanting
characteristics
of
wood
dried
grapes
alcohol
warmth
etc
the
stuff
that
makes
me
love
the
old
ale
style
its
wintery
in
the
spiciness
sure
but
could
pass
for
an
ipa
esp
fresh
in
its
lack
of
malt
backbone
or
character
the
malts
are
certainly
detectable
in
the
feel
of
the
beer
despite
being
largely
absent
from
the
taste
id
be
happy
to
encounter
a
fresh
one
just
for
comparisons
sake
given
how
strong
this
was
the
alcohol
wasnt
that
detectable
and
there
was
only
a
slight
warming
sensation
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
this
was
an
extremely
accessible
beer
and
for
anyone
unaccustomed
to
this
style
this
would
be
a
great
choice
to
start
out
with
even
in
this
freakish
heat
i
would
have
certainly
popped
open
another
had
i
had
a
second
bottle
with
me
overall
a
nice
winter
drinker
overall
had
it
two
years
ago
and
thought
it
was
fine
two
years
later
its
still
fine
id
say
i
wouldnt
revisit
it
but
here
i
am
two
years
later
poured

overall
a

i
find
myself
drinking
every
winter
solid
brew
from
a
great
brewery
cant
argue
when
its
flying
solo
at
1
65
o
a
really
descent
winter
ale
nice
and
spicy
fire
crackling
good
this
is
one
slow
long
traveler
like
the
mad
elf
o
this
is
good
for
the
style
and
for
me
overalltheres
not
much
excitement
to
this
beer
i
paired
it
with
some
abergele
cheese
which
gave
it
a
little
more
purpose
i
would
strongly
recommend
drinking
this
beer
with
some
sort
of
food
it
doesnt
have
enough
character
as
a
standalone
but
the
flavors
really
popped
when
contrasted
with
the
cheese
pretty
darn
tasty
the
hoppiness
and
maltiness
are
balanced
quite
well
definitely
a
good
cold
weather
ale
maybe
just
a
bit
too
heavy
to
drink
a
lot
of
strength
notwithstanding
o
i
would
drink
this
winter
brew
anytime
really
nice
and
refreshing
d
not
bad
a
straightforward
old
ale
and
a
very
approachable
one
for
the
style
a
nice

styled

poured

half

fine

dissipates
slowly
leaving
lacing
mild

flavor
is
fairly
subtle
dominated
by
roasted
and
bready
malt
light
citrus
finishes
rather
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
phenolic
flavor
that
may
be
contributed
by
the
spicing
and
hops
medium
bodied
the
main
flavor
is
nice
but
the
finish
taste
combination
doesnt
work
for
me
o
i
was
duped
a
bit
into
thinking
old
man
winter
would
be
a
darker
more
stout
like
beer
very
light
for
what
i
had
been
expecting
a
decent
beer
though
if
i
knew
it
were
going
to
be
so
light
i
would
want
some
heavier
hop
to
it
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
top
but
i
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
again
this
really
shouldnt
be
called
an
old
ale
although
its
still
a
good
beer
in
general
stylistically
in
color
bitterness
abv
og
and
flavor
its
an

go
for
northcoast

curmudgeon

this
resembles
an
ipa
over
the
winter
ale
we
will
take
it
because
this
is
a
nicely
done
beer
overall
this
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
and
finish
the
blend
of
hops
is
good
and
mixes
well
with
the
malts
great
burger
beer
a
fine
mix
of
malts
and
earthy
hops
theres
a
hint
of
cannabis
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
a
reflection
of
the
biological
affinity
of
hops
and
cannabis
this
winter
ale
is
not
spiced
at
least
not
perceptibly
so
good
lingering
hoppy
aftertaste
o
a
wellhopped
and
unconventional
old
ale
strikes
me
as
a
cross
between
an
extra
special
bitter
and
winter
warmer
i
look
forward
to
savouring
my
last
bottle
o
this
really
struck
me
more
like
an
ipa
without
a
strong
hop
flavor
burst
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
malt
sweetness
the
alcohol
comes
though
in
the
finish
i
would
have
preferred
if
this
was
sweetness
despite
all
of
this
not
bad
maybe
as
a
winter
warmer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
overalla
nice
beer
as
others
have
noted
im
not
so
sure
its
really
much
of
an
old
ale
but
its
a
flavorful
hoppy
beer
with
some
nice
characteristics
worth
a
try
not
truly
an
old
ale
to
me
but
drinkable
enough
certainly
knocks
the
chill
off
ya
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
are
present
taste
is
piney
hops
up
front
some
alcohol
a
touch
of
malts
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
fantastic

a
bit
of
an
american
style
old
ale
great
as
a
winter
seasonal
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
definately
makes
me
think
of
opening
presents
under
the
christmas
tree
this
was
an
average
brew
that
i
dont
believe
lived
up
to
an
old
ale
but
would
make
an
excellent
ipa
for
the
winter
season
one
comparison
that
came
to
mind
was
heavy
seas
winter
storm
based
on
the
hop
profile
and
bitterness
levels
also
winter
storm
didnt
seem
to
match
its
style

minimal

smell
is
of
caramel
malt
syrups
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
taste
is
good
much
malt
again
with
the
caramels
and
syrups
and
a
little
spice
mouthfeel
is
medium

and
smooth
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
feels
seasonal
fo
sho
o
an
average
beer
im
not
familiar
to
reviewing
old
ales
but
this
one
is
still
pretty
tasty
this
one
was
really
good
but
fell
slightly
short
of
my
excellent
beer
5
stars
this
could
really
be
because
i
have
very
high
standards
for
southern
tier
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
flavor
was
really
smooth
and
consistent
from
first
to
last
sip
but
something
was
missing
i
think
the
spice
level
could
be
turned
up
one
click
and
it
would
be
perfection
i
am
curious
to
see
what
this
tastes
like
out
of
the
bottle
seems
to
me
beers
like
these
tend
to
pack
a
higher
punch
of
the
intended
flavors
when
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
then
enjoyed
o
a
nice
winter
seasonal
not
my
favorite
i
honestly
dont
prefer
hoppy
brews
for
winter
seasonals
but
this
one
balances
the
hops
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
caramel
profile
so
its
all
good
o
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
pass
overall
i
loved
this
beer
when
i
first
had
it
at
thanksgiving
a
few
weeks
ago
now
it
doesnt
taste
like
i
thought
it
would
it
tastes
much
like
a
german
style
beer
which
ive
learned
to
love
but
wasnt
expecting
im
giving
it
a
b
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
bit
of
head
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
nose
but
it
smells
decent
enough
a
bit
resiny
spicy
hops
dominate
the
flavor
with
some
bready
malt
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
slight
bit
of
stickiness
overall
this
is
not
what
youd
expect
from
an
old
ale
its
kind
of
just
a
generic
high
abv
amber
decent
and
drinkable
but
nothing
more
overall
its
not
my
fav
from
the
brewery
but
its
decent
enough
its
only
my
second
old
ale
so
i
reserve
the
right
to
alter
my
judgment
of
this
one
in
the
future
unique
beer
for
sure
and
excellent
for
winter
pours
a
dark
copper
color
like
a
tarnished
penny
with
a
small
vanishing
head
smells
a
touch
smokey
and
strong
my
brother
described
the
taste
to
me
as
what
an
old
mans
hat
would
smell
like
in
a
good
way
he
was
right
it
has
a
sort
of
dusty
burlap
malty
base
with
brighter
winter
flavors
like
pipe
tobacco
peppered
throughout
much
like
an
old
mans
cap
might
have
a
fishing
fly
on
the
brim
a
feather
in
the
band
and
some
funny
stain
inside
this
beer
cannot
be
described
in
any
other
way
now
its
got
a
full
bodied
low
carbonation
mouthfeel
which
makes
it
quite
easy
to
appreciate
its
complex
character
my
favorite
winter
beer
of
the
season
so
far
there
are
much
better
examples
of
and
old
ale
i
would
reach
for
before
trying
this
again
overall
this
really
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
still
a
really
good
beer
it
almost
seems
like
this
is
their
attempt
at
making
a
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
its
got
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
and
its
worth
trying
if
you
happen
to
see
it
on
the
shelves
overall
its
not
bad
but
in
comparison
to
other
old
ales
and
st
offerings
i
feel
it
stumbles
its
still
worth
checking
out
though
overall
what
a
fantastic
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
grab
a
fresh
case
for
the
winter
very
surprised
this
is
an
old
ale
since
it
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
oktoberfest
great
beer
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
some
pale
there
is
a
pretty
desent
toasted
or
biscuit
aspect
hops
are
light
drinks
a
medium
weight
on
the
palette
and
has
a
smooth
sticky
feel
i
had
old
man
on
tap
at
jamison
brew
house
and
must
say
that
its
way
better
out
of
the
tap
not
bad
out
of
the
bottle
but
way
better
out
of
the
tap
d
the
alcohol
isnt
present
on
the
palate
therefore
drinks
quite
easily
a
nice
winter
release
from
southern
tier
and
definitely
different
than
most
winter
offerings
but
i
prefer
the
darker
maltier
fullerbodied
and
stronger
ales
that
this
season
brings
my
pour
created
two
dense
fingers
of
deep
mochatan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deep
brownishamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
smelled
of
snowcovered
pine
forest
and
i
was
in
love
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
the
taste
was
clean
and
minty
on
the
tongue
who
need
mouthwash
when
ive
got
this
in
my
glass
finish
was
breathtaking
but
in
the
right
way
it
was
a
big
beer
to
be
sure
but
not
hot
like
the
cigar
city
winter
warmer
warmer
winter
mess
that
i
was
faced
with
on
friday
night
it
was
a
very
pleasant
jump
start
to
the
day
yummy
beer
but
its
just
not
what
unexpected
from
an
old
ale
or
a
winter
warmer
not
disappointed
but
underwhelmed
oits
not
horrible
by
any
mean
but
it
is
a
somewhat
let
down
from
s
t
as
i
have
grown
to
enjoy
more
and
more
of
their
beer
this
year
will
try
again
in
the
future
but
look
more
forward
to
their
fall
releases
than
this
winter
one
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
take
on
an
old
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
maybe
ill
revisit
this
one
someday
but
for
now
i
feel
as
if
it
isnt
even
worth
drinking
the
rest
of
it
hopefully
this
is
just
a
bad
batch
overall
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
an
old
ale
flavors
are
pretty
laid
back
but
whats
there
is
tasty
and
well
balanced
o
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
was
thinking
old
ale
the
malthop
flavors
were
well
blended
and
made
for
a
good
drinking
experience
i
might
pick
this
one
up
again
o
a
very
nice
winter
ale
im
a
huge
fan
of
southern
tiers
more
subtle
beers
ive
been
drinking
so
many
extreme
brews
that
these
kind
of
mediumbody
ales
are
becoming
my
refreshment
drink
its
late
fall
in
nyc
and
they
sell
this
around
the
corner
ill
definitely
drink
a
few
more
throughout
the
cold
season
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
smell
is
hoppy
sweet
roasted
malt
with
some
spice
in
there
as
well
taste
has
a
nice
malt
presence
that
revolves
around
sweet
hop
flavors
finishes
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
not
a
highly
noticeable
abv
overall
a
nicely
done
winter
ale
great
flavors
and
well
balanced
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
and
hazed
copper
with
moderate
cap
of
khaki
froth
decent
retention
and
good
sticky
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
scent
is
hop
forward
lots
of
orange
zest
and
the
malt
comes
across
as
more
toasted
than
sweet
decent
lingering
spice
notes
on
the
rear
full
flavored
beer
leads
with
the
hops
again
mostly
citrus
with
firm
notes
of
spicy
and
piney
malt
backbone
is
quite
deep
ranging
from
dry
and
tannic
roasted
grains
toasted
and
nutty
to
lightly
sweet
and
caramely
again
a
decent
spice
profile
lingers
on
the
end
medium
bodied
and
dry
finish
overall
a
style
bender
for
sure
firm
hop
and
malt
character
and
a
nice
splash
of
winter
spice
o
a
pleasant
wintery
ale
with
a
fair
bit
of
character
notes
not
a
bad
beer
overall
i
wold
pick
this
one
up
again
cheers
the
appearance
was
a
deep
burnt
orange
with
little
head
and
no
retention
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
or
definitive
at
all
there
are
rich
malts
up
front
with
a
good
dose
of
hoppiness
in
the
finish
a
reasonably
good
effort
from
a
brewery
that
i
like
more
than
most
i
really
dislike
this
one
it
is
nearly
to
the
point
where
i
may
just
drain
pour
it
this
isnt
for
me
at
all
starts
to
crackle
and
pop
immediately
as
i
pour
very
loud
beer
pours
a
vibrant
copperamber
color
and
is
nice
and
clear
smells
of
a
ton
of
roasted
malts
and
even
some
hazelnuts
very
well
balanced
silky
and
big
bodied
as
expected
a
nice
hop
presence
despite
it
being
a
winter
brew
butterscotch
and
roasted
malt
sweetness
up
front
these
tastes
wash
away
pretty
quickly
though
as
a
spicy
hop
presence
sweeps
through
also
has
some
burning
wood
like
characteristics
to
it
this
slightly
burnt
characteristic
lingers
in
the
mouth
a
little
makes
you
feel
as
if
youve
been
sitting
by
a
fire
all
day
definitely
could
make
for
a
more
than
solid
winter
session
beer
a
viscous
icedtea
colored
liquid
with
a
minimally
satisfying
offwhite
head
is
offset
by
the
encouragingly
hoppy
smell
there
is
an
excellent
balance
between
the
hop
and
malty
taste
lending
to
a
medium
mouthfeel
tastes
like
a
hop
bud
lightly
coated
in
carmel
is
sitting
on
my
tongue
in
conclusion
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
very
easily
not
a
bad
winter
beer
the
malt
has
a
unique
character
some
nice
spiciness
without
any
of
the
usual
cinnamonnutmeg
stuff
havent
had
many
old
ales
but
im
pretty
sure
they
tend
to
be
darker
sweeter
and
thicker
than
this
maybe
not
an
old
ale
under
british
but
without
a
doubt
an
excellent
beer
all
in
balance
o
a
very
tasty
beer
a
good
example
of
how
beers
can
have
big
flavors
but
stay
balanced
o
old
man
is
a
winter
ale
that
packs
a
punch
the
bitter
hops
are
stars
from
start
to
finish
though
the
alcohol
is
modest
for
winter
beers
7
7
it
is
noticeable
though
some
of
the
edge
wears
off
as
the
beer
warms
while
winter
beers
are
not
always
balanced
this
beer
seems
like
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
that
very
trait
the
hops
consume
the
beer
and
woodroasted
malts
pleasantly
bitter
overall
an
excellent
and
nicely
spiced
example
of
a
winter
warmer
recommended
o
actually
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
unlike
most
in
the
style
was
pretty
easy
drinking
and
smooth
overall
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
i
have
loved
everything
from
southern
tier
but
i
barely
liked
this
one
dont
go
beating
down
the
door
for
this
one
but
not
a
bad
try
if
the
effort
isnt
great
thanks
to
merc7186
for
this
extra
deep
amber
in
color
very
clear
with
a
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
caramel
malts
citrus
hops
and
spicevery
nice
flavor
of
caramel
malts
with
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
i
didnt
notice
the
hops
or
spice
in
the
flavor
after
it
warmed
up
i
tasted
some
smoky
malts
medium
bodied
with
an
effervescent
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
overall
not
bad
interesting
malts
and
syrup
sweet
flavors
nothing
spectacular
though
a
nice
would
be
winter
ale
mid
hurricane
without
power
d
very
drinkable
the
spices
and
the
booze
feel
nicely
balanced
against
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
especially
after
six
months
of
aging
one
of
the
better
domestic
xmastime
brews
out
there
surely
give
it
a
try
when
its
out
o
awesome
brew
held
together
wonderfully
with
time
i
would
love
to
try
this
brew
fresh
awesome
brew
collected
as
an
extra
in
a
great
trade
seems
a
bit
more
than
7
2
o
a
well
balanced
easily
drinkable
well
put
together
winter
ale
just
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
old
man
winter
in
my
opinion
was
very
good
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
pretty
dark
looking
the
smell
was
sweet
with
malts
and
perhaps
some
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
sweet
also
with
a
slight
spice
to
it
there
is
a
really
nice
caramel
flavor
upfront
in
this
beer
that
realy
keeps
me
going
back
for
the
next
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
which
i
enjoy
too
overall
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
and
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
some
day
not
as
fullbodied
as
one
might
expect
carbonation
is
pretty
strong
finish
is
dry
though
there
is
an
aspect
of
warming
it
fades
pretty
quickly
again
overall
not
bad
at
all
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
while
not
being
the
best
one
of
the
night
was
certaing
more
then
deserving
overall
very
solid
offering
here
this
is
a
sweet
tasty
beer
that
hides
its
7
abv
well
easy
to
drink
and
would
go
well
with
a
hearty
meal
very
enjoyable
but
with
a
7
2
abv
its
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
session
beer
o
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
it
resembled
much
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
winter
ale
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
less
hops
ore
more
sweet
flavor
to
balance
out
the
hoppyness
any
ipa
drinker
will
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
o
easy
drinking
begs
to
be
drank
with
food
meaty
stews
would
be
perfect
taste
has
just
a
tiny
hit
of
fruit

d
i
was
really
surprised
with
this
winter
ale
i
think
this
would
have
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
this
year
a
great
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
and
it
allows
both
to
be
showcased
d
i
was
expecting
an
old
ale
so
this
was
quite
a
surprise
it
was
enjoyable
and
certainly
more
so
than
the
other
hoppy
offerings
from
st
drinkability
very
different
from
the
time
i
had
on
tap
this
one
actually
was
tougher
to
drink
whenever
there
is
a
beer
which
is
medium
bodied
and
above
i
always
say
these
are
the
toughest
to
drink
who
knows
i
enjoyed
this

nice

the

heavy

a

this

was

of

downer
is

theres
something
about

of
a
baby

candy
bar
nuttiness
caramel
and
chocolate
as
far
as
old

are
concerned
its
one
of
the
more

members
of
the
style
in
that
it
avoids
being
cloying
an
old
ale
brewed
for
the
season
that
grows
old
i
love
the
idea
im
also
pretty
fond
of
the
beer
old
man
strikes
an
uncommon
but
appreciated
compromise
between
bold
elegant
flavours
and
quaffable
carefree
drinkability
by
blending
the
cold
weather
comfort
of
rich
sweet
maltiness
with
the
sunny
tropical
goodness
of
hops
nicely
done
mouthfeel
is
medium
at
best
and
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
that
i
was
assuming
from
the
look
of
this
thing
isnt
represented
at
all
not
a
huge
abv
compared
to
some
of
the
other
old
ales
i
have
had
but
drinkable
nonetheless
there
is
some
alchojol
present
after
it
leaves
but
just
enough
to
let
you
know
your
drinking
a
beer
d
really
quite
drinkable
for
a
winter
weight
beer
without
being
ponderous
d
very
drinkable
i
could
walk
into
a
bar
and
drink
this
one
all
night
good
beer
pours
a
modest
one
finger

of
off
white
foam
nice
clear
light
brown
body
a
good
ring
of

and
some
big
bubbles
remain
smells
initially
of
some
earthy
english
hops
i
also
get
some
carmel
slight
citrus
sweet
malt
on
the
taste
i
get
some
carmel
toffee
sweetness
at

then
some
resinous
piney

a
pleasant
neutral
moist

maybe
some
smoky
notes

light

medium

i
enjoy
the

neutral

a
touch

i
can
drink
this
quite
easily
nice

for
the
single
the
heavy
pine
flavor
of
the
hops
combine
with
the
taste
of
bitter
orange
rind
to
give
this
beer
an
intense
start
light
caramel
provides
some
sweetness
but
it
takes
the
back
seat
to
the
bitter
qualities
the
raisin
flavor
comes
out
before
the
finish
which
is
also
when
the
alcohol
is
most
noticeable
spices
are
also
present
near
the
back
end
overall
a
little
more
bitter
than
what
i
prefer
in
an
old
ale
i
would
have
liked
a
stronger
sweetcaramel
balance
to
give
this
the
depth
that
i
usually
enjoy
in
this
style
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
this
was
a
nice
suprise
for
a
winter
warmer
excellent
malt
base
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
to
offset
caramel

not
over

of

even
some
of

this

the
mouthfeel
could
benefit

changes

the
taste
is
good
enough
and
it
gives
a
hoppy
bitterness
bite
that
is
a
welcome
change
from
most
of
the
beers
of
this
style
out
there
mediumfull
body
with
the
malt
and
hops
trading
blows
all
the
way
to
the
finish
where
the
hops
edge
it
out
by
a
hair
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
readily
drinkable
beer
the
balance
of
malts
and
hops
meant
that
it
was
neither
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
just
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
its
medium
thickness
and
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
alright
as
it
goes
down
but
the
overwhelming
aftertaste
really
hurts
it
as
a
southern

fan
im
a
little
let
down
by
old
man
its
just
not
very
good
the
flavor
never
quite
meshes
together
correctly
its
almost
like
they
threw
everything
they
had
in
the
bottle
and
it
never
quite
works
right
solid

i
like
the
bitterness
of
it
and
would
drink
it
plenty

a
modest
off

that
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of

on

aroma
is
floral

caramel

taste
is

bitterness
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
mouthfeel

good
with

perhaps

good

this

will
send

fit
the

still

of
age

only
in
a
good
way
it
will
be
interested
to
see
where
this

goes
in
the

o
this
is
a
big
sweet
chewy
beer
that
is
very
filling
but
the
flavors
are
complex
and
pleasant
not
for
every
occasion
but
for
times
when
you
want
a
reflective
sipping
beer
this
is
very
nice

and
very
easy

for
a
powerhouse

everything
seems
welltempered

this
borders
on
an
english
barleywine
but
has
even
more
maltiness
a
bit
hot
but
plenty
of
rich
flavor
to
support
the
alcohol
i
remember
enjoying
this
in
the
decadence
version
and
am
glad
its
in
regular
rotation
now
im
going
back
for
a
few
to
cellar
love
the
old
ale
style
and
how
many
different
ways
it
gets
brewed
this
is
one
of
the
more
classic
english
types
almost
a
barleywine
but
with
a
lot
more
pronounced
malt
fruitiness
and
a
more
drinkable
overall
beer
but
there
are
plenty
of
similarities
very
english
in
nature
tons

here
bready

enough
it
doesnt
really
need
to
be
any
more
beefy
the
toffee
grain
profile
is
big
the
alcohol
stands
out
just
enough
and
i
find
the
whole
thing
quite
decadent

having

cleaning

the
same
with
malt
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
quite
boozy
at
the
moment
b
t
rich
and
malty
with
a
nice
touch
of
dark
fruit
some
burnt
raisin
skins
come
through
near
the
finish
with
some
plum
brown
sugar
and
leather
the
flavor
is
a
touch
bland
until
the
finish
and
then
theres
just
an
absolute
firecracker
of
dark
fruit
that
goes
off
in
your
mouth
finish
is
dry
with
a
touch
of
burnt
wood
tobacco
and
just
a
hint
of
booze
the
bottle
says
you
can
age
this
for
up
to
20
years
and
i
would
love
to
see
what
at
least
a
few
years
would
do
to
this
pours
a
copper
body
with
a
kind
of
off
white
head
smells
piney
and
a
little
citrusy
the
pine
tip
flavor
is
pretty
interesting
fairly
solid
brew
2
thumbs

will
drink

pours
with
a
small
white
head
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
murkiness
to
it
although
it
is
not
a
pale
ale
it
has
a
pale
ale
smell
with
a
pale
ale
taste
just
not
as
citrusy
and
hoppy
as
a
pale
ale
overall
an
above
average
ale
very
nice
winter
ale
piñon
like
aftertaste
smooth
and
enjoyable
overall
a
fairly
interesting
brew
maybe
just
a
touch
odd
overall
well
i
like
it
as
a
beer
i
havent
had
too
many
old
ales
if
anything
i
know
this
goes
pretty
good
with
food
and
in
my
opinion
smoked
salmon
nice
drinkable
old
ale
for
a
cold
evening
o
it
isnt
the
most
appealing
of
brews
at
first
glance
by
scent
or
sight
however
the
flavor
is
unique
and
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
was
kind
of
thrown
for
a
loop
with
it
being
classified
as
an
old
ale
think
hibernation
ale
by
great
divide
which
are
generally
darker
fruitier
and
more
complex
this
drinks
like
a
kolsch
or
summer
ale
almost
with
a
slight
hint
of
more
wintery
oriented
brews
great
taste
but
lacking
in
the
overall
niceties
you
want
from
an
allaround
strong
old
ale
the
characteristics
are
there
but
not
enough
in
my
opinion
for
my
first
alaskan
beer
though
i
am
fairly
satisfied
and
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
them
in
one
sitting
will
have
to
check
out
more
of
their
selection
very
nice
while
i
wasnt
sure
at
first
i
also
pick
up
on
tartness
that
really
reminds
me
of
wild
alaskan
blueberries
which
im
very
familiar
with
in
both
aroma
and
taste
i
dont
dont
know
where
its
coming
from
but
i
like
it
overall
this
is
an
ale
that
doesnt
overpower
in
any
area
but
is
balanced
and
integrated
as
well
as
unique
subtlety
is
key
using
only
the
tips
and
not
the
whole
tree
pours
golden
red
and
clear
with
only
a
bit
of
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
little
if
any
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aromas
of
roasted
malt
banana
baked
apple
bread
a
wee
bit
of
piney
hops
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
as
a
winter
ale
should
be
with
some
tanginess
from
the
spruce
lightly
carbonated
the
spruce
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
drier
character
than
you
would
expect
with
a
winter
ale
not
a
very
long
finish
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
although
i
am
not
particular
fond
of
spruce
tips
as
flavoring
poured
a
clear
amber
body
with
no
real
head
it
looks
alright
though
not
the
best
for
the
style
scents
of
fruity
esters
apple
sweet
malt
with
aromas
of
brown
sugar
sweet
spices
especially
cinnamon
and
light
bubblegum
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
old
ale
that
is
quite
appealing
in
its
overall
profile
and
true
to
the
style
the
spruce
tips
do
not
show
up
in
the
aroma
which
is
disappointing
flavor
begins
malty
sweet
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
apple
and
brown
bread
with
a
light
spiciness
of
cinnamon
and
a
very
light
resinous
bitterness
likely
the
spruce
tips
this
moves
into
a
middle
with
more
abundant
cinnamon
as
well
as
a
light
a
alcohol
presence
finish
is
lightly
sweet
with
notes
of
apple
sweet
malt
and
brown
sugar
mingling
with
cinnamon
and
sweet
spices
and
balanced
by
a
light
presence
of
alcohol
and
a
slight
bitterness
aftertaste
is
lightly
bitter
with
notes
of
cinnamon
alcohol
what
i
assume
is
spruce
and
grainy
malt
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
nice
old
ale
spicy
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
mediumlight
carbonation
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
this
is
a
rather
nice
old
ale
it
is
sweet
and
spicy
as
the
style
demands
and
despite
its
6

abv
it
shows
its
alcohol
well
which
is
pleasant
for
a

night
it
is
smooth

is
an

and
well
worth
trying
my
score
is
for
the
bottled
version
which
i
thought
was
very
good
the
draft
version
was
just
ok
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light

resulting
in

is

appropriate
and

feeling

closes
semidry

clinging
to
the

and

winter
ale
pours
a
darker
copper
color
with
a
small
non
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
sweet
fruity
and
piney
aroma
the
taste
has
a
sharp
malt
backbone
lots
of
pine
citrus
flavors
sweet
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
little
too
flat
overall
it
is
pretty
sweet
and
fruity
the
spruce
tips
make
it
unique
overall
a
nice
amber
ale
you
must
like
sweet
beers
when
i
was
taking
notes
on
it
i
thought
it
was
a
winter
warmer
but
looking
back
it
could
be
stretched
to
fit
in
with
old
ale
as
styles
are
open
to
interpretation
whatever
the
case
it
makes
a
nice
winter
ale
pours
out
a
translucent
maroon
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
with
little
retention
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
sweet
sugar
dark
malts
with
a
tad
of
orange
the
components
in
the
are
pretty
subdued
but
present
taste
is
basically
what
was
in
the
nose
except
a
tad
more
malty
and
there
is
a
tad
of
bitterness
the
tastes
are
all
quite
subdued
as
they
were
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
semithin
which
seems
reasonable
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
is
it
anything
too
great
its
pretty
good
but
i
like
my
winter
beers
in
a
different
style
overall
this
is
a
fairly
nice
beer
the
local
spruce
is
a
nice
twist
but
it
may
be
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
that
artificial
cherry
flavor
is
kind
of
unexpected
and
bizarre
thankfully
the
sweetness
doesnt
hang
heavy
on
my
tongue
but
i
definitely
would
not
order
a
second
round
if
repeat
orders
are
the
measure
of
a
successful
pint
i
guess
this
one
has
failed
but
i
certainly
dont
regret
purchasing
this
single
bottle
and
may
consider
another
one
next
year

overall
i
really
dont
understand
how
this
beer
could
be
an
old
ale
if
anything
its
a
winter
warmer
but
it
doesnt
really
fit
anything
in
particular
this
beer
is
by
far
the
worst
old
ale
ive
ever
had
it
not
an
awful
beer
just
an
awful
old
ale
it
doesnt
have
any
real
dark
fruit
presents
or
alcohol
intensity
httpyoutu
betjowachg1no
totally
satisfying
though
doesnt
touch
the
outer
realms
of
my
favorite
old
ale
bells
third
coast
olde
ale
arguably
more
of
a
barley
wine
anyway
i
had
to
try
this
because
of
the
spruce
tips
i
give
props
always
to
alaskan
for
having
an
unpopular
german
style
alt
as
a
yearround
brew
but
this
one
just
didnt
cut
it
for
me
longest
a
sixpack
has
lasted
in
my
fridge
pours
triaminic
orange
with
pretty
much
zero
head
just
a
little
perimeter
of
foam
nose
is
actually
a
little
tough
to
get
anything
from
smells
a
little
sweet
and
lightly
hopped
but
not
detecting
the
spruce
tips
the
packaging
says
its
brewed
with
there
is
a
real
berrylike
quality
in
the
flavor
and
i
was
getting
a
little
of
that
in
the
nose
too
its
got
a
blackberry
jam
element
to
it
is
that
spruce
tips
i
dont
know
all
i
know
is
this
tastes
really
freakin
good
nice
medium
mouthfeel
bitter
on
the
back
end
some
detectable
alcohol
but
not
a
hugealcohol
beer
really
low
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
would
get
it
again
simple
old
ale
plenty
of
spice
notes
and
a
grainy
malt
backbone
much
better
than
alaskans
amber
as
a
winter
session
beer
not
a
bad
beer
rather
middle
of
the
road
interesting
to
try
othis
beer
gets
points
for
originality
and
for
not
overdoing
it
on
the
spruce
tips
usually
tree
is
quite
bitter
tasting
but
here
the
tree
pairs
well
with
other
flavors
i
would
not
want
to
drink
it
every
day
but
it
made
for
a
good
winter
brew
so
extra
points
for
truth
in
marketing
presentation
packaged
in
a
stubby
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
definitely
unlike
other
winter
ales
very
drinkable
and
mild
its
just
not
as
spicy
as
i
would
expect
others
are
too
spicy
but
this
one
just
doesnt
feel
like
a
winter
ale
still
a
good
beer
though
amber
pour
with
a
thinnish
head
minimal
lace
smell
is
crackers
bread
malt
with
a
lightness
that
may
be
spruce
but
its
certainly
not
piney
taste
is
a
solid
cracker
crust
malt
base
quite
tasty
with
a
nice
helping
of
hop
leaving
the
palate
lightly
refreshed
a
hint
of
bubblegum
and
perhaps
lemon
toward
the
end
nice
medium
body
with
a
hefty
well
crafted
feel
easy
drinker
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
appearance
is
good
enough
on
the
front
end
although
quickly
deteriorates
nose
is
however
a
really
nice
floral
bready
thing
going
on
with
some
sweet
notes
flavor
is
a
hoppy
sweetened
bitter
experience
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
tried
this
ale
at
a
bar
and
really
enjoyed
it
found
it
at
my
local
liquor
store
and
bought
a
sixer
poured
it
in
a
glass
and
had
at
it
smells
great
tastes
better
hints
of
fruit
and
spice
and
i
dare
say
minty
finish
but
not
too
sweet
or
minty
one
beer
turned
into
2
then
3
and
i
actually
drank
4
of
them
i
was
so
intruiged
by
the
taste
really
nice
ale
awesome
winter
beer
i
would
definitely
like
a
six
pack
i
just
wish
the
labeling
were
more
appealing
so
that
more
people
might
discover
it
going
to
keep
this
short
and
sweet
this
beer
us
subpar
on
multiple
levels
numerous
pours
lead
to
little
or
no
head
and
what
stays
around
evaporates
quickly
the
smell
is
light
and
slightly
aromatic
with
the
spruce
tips
hardly
noticeable
this
tastes
like
a
ightly
upgraded
lager
low
in
carbonation
and
just
disappointing
all
around
will
not
but
this
again
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
an
orangegold
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
to
small
patches
of
foam
and
slight
slippery
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
bready
malt
and
light
fruit
flavor
of
sweet
malt
grain
a
hint
of
toasted
malt
and
hint
of
spruce
skates
on
the
edge
of
too
sweet
but
sweetness
is
balanced
by
the
malt
and
apple
and
grape
juice
flavors
light
to
medium
bodied
a
pleasant
light
flavored
ale
with
an
interesting
pine
flavor
from
the
spruce
but
not
nearly
malty
enough
to
be
an
old
ale
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
what
i
expected
o
pretty
good
when
i
think
of
a
winter
warmer
gingerbread
and
spices
come
to
mind
this
one
has
taken
the
fruitcake
aspect
of
the
holidays
its
very
fruity
and
sweet
but
never
overbearing
if
someone
offered
me
it
i
would
graciously
accept
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
overall
not
exceptional
in
any
way
but
this
is
a
good
wellrounded
beer
one
i
like
to
have
at
least
once
a
year
during
the
winter
months
especially
if
its
on
tap
the
flavor
of
the
spruce
tips
does
well
to
add
a
uniqueness
to
this
beer
a
character
you
dont
often
see
in
other
winter
seasonal
offerings
o
i
was
expecting
an
old
ale
certainly
a
bit
maltier
than
this
beer
was
but
all
in
all
tasty
and
easy
drinking
o
a
surprise
from
alaskan
brewing
will
probably
buy
a
six
pack
soon
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
it
tastes
bready
and
malty
with
some
lemon
and
spruce
the
beer
is
very
smooth
medium
bodied
with
a
long
satisfying
finish
very
nice
beer
here
would
definitely
drink
this
again
wow
i
really
like
this
brew
poured
it
a
bit
warm
and
i
think
that
was
a
good
idea
as
the
spruce
tips
really
come
out
giving
a
sweet
ripe
berry
component
poured
with
a
smallish
creamcolored
head
that
soon
settled
out
to
a
few
islands
and
a
ring
with
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
medium
clear
amber
with
huge
amounts
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
caramel
toffee
fruit
wet
grain
flavors
like
nose
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
overly
sweet
and
carbonic
tang
are
in
front
with
just
enough
bitter
to
balance
it
all
nicely
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
finish
is
like
flavor
lingers
for
a
while
has
a
slight
booziness
and
is
so
drinkable
curious
to
see
if
its
this
good
a
little
colder
o
disappointing
beer
overall
it
had
some
good
points
but
i
did
not
get
any
spruce
flavors
or
aromas
here
overall
a
unique
and
understated
brew
that
delivers
subtle
yet
tasty
ale
drinking
enjoyment
i
might
have
to
revisit
this
at
some
point
this
upcoming
winter
hits
the
spot
on
the
first
real
cold
spell
this
november
go
try
it
an
excellent
winter
ale
flavorful
with
interesting
taste
complexities
nicely
balanced
with
a
subtle
boldness
tasty
and
easy
drinking
o
this
beer
is
not
what
i
expected
out
of
an
old
ale
but
damn
is
good
lots
of
big
fruity
flavor
and
a
minty
freshness
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
coded
bottle
date
this
pours
an
amberish
color
with
a
smaller
but
decent
off
white
head
with
a
med
retention
length
the
smells
are
light
but
nice
a
little
sweet
some
caramel
malts
some
spruce
berries
the
feel
is
medium
with
higher
carbonation
the
taste
is
high
malts
a
little
bitterness
and
some
berries
this
looks
fantastic
a
glowing
amber
with
a
toasted
white
cotton
puff
atop
it
thick
cloudy
like
the
sf
fog
the
bouquet
is
pleasantly
piney
like
an
evergreen
or
pine
forest
backed
by
an
orange
marmalade
note
flavor
has
a
mild
bitterness
and
theres
some
definite
pine
notes
and
a
sweetish
caramel
malt
finish
smooth
and
enjoyable
not
a
bad
beer
from
alaskan
would
buy
again
and
recommend
to
friends
taste
has
more
of
the
blueberryesque
fruitiness
with
a
grainy
sweetness
that
screams
honey
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
ale
although
it
does
plenty
to
stand
apart
from
your
typical
winter
offering
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
silky
and
flows
from
malty
to
fruity
to
mild
finish
quite
well
ill
buy
this
again
for
sure
good
beer
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
honey
dark
fruit
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
the
spruce
comes
through
in
the
flavor
adding
a
bit
of
a
herbal
minty
quality
i
also
get
some
honey
and
the
associated
sweetness
as
well
as
some
grape
and
cherry
notes
the
alcohol
is
not
present
in
the
flavor
which
makes
the
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
winter
beer
cheers
nice
use
of
spruce
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
o
i
probably
wouldnt
grab
this
one
again
not
special
enough
and
the
sweet
flavor
is
offputting
personally
i
would
have
liked
more
body
but
the
rich
flavors
great
maltyspicy
tango
and
incredibly
unique
spruce
flavors
makes
this
another
beer
that
will
be
keeping
me
warm
through
the
harsh
winters
of
mn
my
first
beer
from
alaskan
brewing
co
and
not
a
bad
one
its
not
going
to
touch
odell
isolation
but
its
solid
drinkability
good
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
find
again
this
one
is
weird
like
many
others
i
couldnt
pin
down
the
aroma
i
was
out
and
about
and
didnt
care
to
be
bothered
smelling
it
for
10
minutes
so
i
dove
in
really
enjoyed
the
sweet
spucy
taste
to
it
definitely
different
ill
have
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
light
the
beer
started
with
a
biscuity
aroma
and
presented
a
copper
color
the
initial
taste
was
a
surprising
sour
flavor
this
lemon
flavor
was
a
surprise
for
a
winter
ale
the
sourness
stays
on
the
tongue
nicely
to
the
finish
it
is
smooth
without
a
bothersome
level
of
carbonation
though
pleasing
the
beer
is
a
little
onedimensional
in
terms
of
the
flavor
this
beer
is
enigmatic
a
lightbodied
sprucy
old
ale
the
elements
combine
well
forming
something
that
i
enjoy
but
have
a
hard
time
describing
its
malty
kinda
and
spicy
kinda
and
good
all
around
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
orangewhite
head
that
settle
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
drip
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
malt
powder
caramel
toffee
and
a
distinct
banana
aroma
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
caramel
toffee
banana
and
a
certain
herbal
quality
that
i
will
attribute
to
the
spruce
tips
used
in
the
brewing
of
this
beer
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
has
a
toasty
quality
this
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
lot
i
had
this
one
before
and
i
dont
remember
liking
it
all
that
much
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
another
bottle
to
revisit
o
overall
not
too
bad
im
glad
i
had
this
while
im
home
for
the
holidays
because
as
far
as
i
know
i
cant
get
alaska
brewing
out
in
nebraska
nothing
special
about
the
mouthfeel
normal
i
liked
the
nos
eand
taste
better
when
it
warmed
overall
there
wasnt
much
to
the
taste
yet
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
worth
the
1
48
for
a
12oz
at
6
4
alaska
winter
ale
some
friends
brought
over
a
six
of
the
alaska
winter
ale
the
other
weekend
in
a
glass
this
beer
has
a
deep
color
with
an
orange
look
to
it
very
interesting
the
head
is
of
average
thickness
and
offwhite
aroma
is
subtle
and
hard
to
pinpoint
the
winter
ale
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
balance
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
does
not
have
any
bitter
or
overly
hoppy
component
to
it
there
is
an
unusual
flavor
to
this
brew
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
did
enjoy
this
alaskan
offering
even
if
it
has
been
a
challenge
to
review
the
label
says
it
is
brewed
with
spruce
tips
which
must
impart
the
flavor
that
escapes
my
ability
to
describe
give
it
a
try
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
that
i
dont
quite
understand
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
doesnt
sit
right
on
my
tongue
overall
good
for
a
winter
all
good
for
a
sprucy
introduction
overall
i
found
this
really
different
and
interesting
the
sweet
candy
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
the
flavors
are
wintery
but
not
at
all
like
the
average
winter
warmer
a
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
light
biscuit
malt
aftertaste
this
is
another
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
from
alaskan
brewing
i
could
drink
this
again
easily
dr
very
drinkable
the
price
could
be
better
id
definitely
have
it
again
quite
lovely
indeed
o
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
more
satisfying
in
the
past
must
be
my
palate
overall
a
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
the
spruce
tips
add
a
interesting
twist
throughout
southeast
alaska
bald
eagles
can
be
spotted
landing
atop
the
towering
old
growth
forests
of
sitka
spruce
trees
as
many
as
3000
bald
eagles
congregate
among
these
evergreen
trees
on
the
shores
of
the
chilkat
river
for
the
last
large
run
of
salmon
before
winter
sitka
spruce
trees
carry
a
significance
of
their
own
to
local
alaskans
the
tender
new
growth
of
the
spruce
tips
lends
a
delicious
yet
subtly
sweet
floral
aroma
to
teas
jelly
and
now
our
alaskan
winter
ale
this
has
been
a
goto
winter
ale
for
me
for
years
theres
just
something
about
the
balance
of
flavors
that
i
love
this
one
was
a
bit
of
an
eye
opener
for
me
i
expected
nothing
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
a
very
tasty
winter
beer
its
very
drinkable
compared
to
some
other
winter
style
warmers
the
sweetness
is
very
nice
and
tasty
shurg
while
nothing
extraordinary
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
all
things
considered
this
is
an
enjoyable
easy
to
appreciate
and
drink
winter
ale
from
alaskan
brewing
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
hand
at
an
airport
facility
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
easy
to
get
not
over
priced
brews
i
used
to
like
this
beer
years
ago
when
i
was
first
getting
into
the
craft
beer
scene
i
remember
the
pine
flavor
being
prevalent
but
not
overpowering
but
this
most
recent
tasting
was
very
different
the
prevailing
flavor
was
cough
syrupish
i
hope
that
this
is
due
to
a
recipe
change
and
they
go
back
to
the
original
because
if
its
my
taste
buds
that
are
to
blame
for
this
reversal
in
flavor
then
all
hope
is
lost
for
this
beer
should
be
advertised
and
labeled
as
a
fruit
flavored
beer
and
take
spruce
off
the
label
then
i
would
of
never
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
not
enjoying
the
flavor
3

had
a
pint
at
3
squares
in
maple
grove
mn
it
was
a
smooth
slightly
sweet
with
fruity
notes
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
summit
winter
ale
from
st
paul
its
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
but
its
a
little
more
simple
than
id
like
sure
its
not
too
sweet
or
heavy
but
a
little
crisp
clean
malt
character
or
spice
would
go
a
long
way
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
in
flavor
and
a
heavier
body
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
foam
above
the
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
and
ripe
fruit
in
the
nose
a
faint
hint
of
spruce
lingers
in
the
background
on
the
palate
the
malt
is
a
little
husky
up
front
a
fruitiness
almost
berry
like
rises
through
the
center
as
the
spruce
and
malt
comingle
it
finishes
with
a
light
pop
of
spice
which
balances
everything
an
interesting
twist
to
a
winter
staple
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
is
pleasant
but
quite
simple
and
straight
forward
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
highly
doubt
i
will
drink
it
again
overall
this
winter
warmer
is
awfully
bland
just
loads
up
on
the
malt
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
really
noticed
spruce
any
where
in
this
beer
if
youre
going
to
say
it
is
there
on
the
bottle
it
should
be
in
the
bottle
too
worth
looking
into
if
you
want
something
with
a
psuedo
belgiany
fruitiness
and
holiday
spicing
that
stands
apart
from
the
crowd
by
having
spruce
tips
in
it
my
main
complaint
is
that
distracting
light
undertone
of
metallic
flavor
get
rid
of
that
tweak
the
carbonation
slightly
add
a
bit
of
earthy
hop
tones
and
this
could
be
something
really
amazing
just
not
too
pleasing
for
me
d
light
on
the
spruce
and
easily
drinkable
but
a
bit
boring
not
on
the
spiced
level
of
most
winter
warmers
i
can
understand
why
other
reviews
question
this
beers
categorization
as
a
winter
warmer
it
isnt
something
that
i
would
sip
by
the
fire
to
warm
me
up
but
it
is
a
great
winter
session
beer
for
watching
sports
its
unique
and
growing
taste
makes
it
an
a
beer
in
my
book
the
flavor
isnt
that
great
imo
it
is
just
like
the
most
basic
golden
ale
you
could
imagine
slightly
buttery
with
a
hint
of
spruce
overall
im
not
disappointed
that
the
spruce
tips
didnt
come
through
the
malty
bready
fruity
aspects
of
this
beer
make
it
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
found
at
my
local
grocer
yet
its
not
complex
but
that
just
lends
to
its
charm
its
honest
simple
affordable
and
just
mixes
well
with
winter
in
a
way
few
beers
can
o
a
good
winter
beer
that
takes
a
different
perspective
than
the
standard
spicebombs
a
lot
of
brewers
make
was
real
stoked
for
the
spruce
tip
component
had
a
brilliant
spruce
tip
casked
ipa
this
summer
and
thought
this
might
be
similar
it
wasnt
at
all
but
not
in
a
bad
way
pours
a
perfectly
clear
maple
syrup
color
with
the
slightest
red
hue
to
it
super
carbonated
head
that
fades
quickly
tons
of
bubbles
rising
up
from
what
i
thought
was
a
clean
pint
glass
bubbles
never
stopped
nose
is
slightly
sugary
and
deep
a
glorious
but
gentle
waft
of
pine
appears
in
the
nose
too
i
cant
get
the
spruce
in
the
taste
though
possible
a
pine
sap
stickyness
but
none
of
that
christmas
tree
vibe
does
have
a
residual
spice
element
maybe
anise
and
also
a
fruity
element
maybe
ground
cherries
or
plums
mouthfeel
is
just
way
too
thin
for
a
winter
warmer
but
it
works
under
another
name
first
alaskan
wont
be
my
last
overall
one
of
your
more
easy
drinking
winter
seasonals
that
imparts
a
taste
of
the
great
alaskan
outdoors
during
winter
not
a
bad
choice
for
holiday
gatherings
the
higher
abv
gives
it
some
more
warming
power
overall
i
really
dont
understand
why
they
made
this
so
damn
sweet
should
have
finished
drier
or
added
noticeable
hops
or
maybe
actually
made
something
noteworthy
with
those
spruce
tips
i
am
starting
to
feel
that
the
12
ounce
offerings
from
alaskan
are
just
not
worth
my
time
or
money
anymore
t
its
tasty
and
smooth
and
malty
a
good
ww
easy
to
drink
i
sixer
for
the
whole
season
will
be
enough
for
me
overall
a
solid
and
very
well
made
offering
but
im
not
digging
the
flavor
combinations
here
o
tough
to
review
not
really
a
winter
warmer
have
not
had
it
for
the
last
two
years
but
seem
to
remember
a
much
more
pronounced
spruce
flavor
remember
a
friend
who
could
not
stand
the
beer
said
it
was
like
gnawing
on
a
tree
branch
that
was
the
appeal
to
myself
guess
i
was
in
the
minority
still
its
a
very
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
overall
i
guess
this
one
is
pretty
good
just
not
great
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
however
the
spruce
seems
less
strong
then
it
was
in
the
past
which
kills
it
for
me
still
i
keep
buying
cases
of
this
stuff
so
i
must
like
it
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
i
wish
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
definitely
worth
a
try
though
amber
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
with
no
lacing
aroma
is
mainly
caramel
malts
and
evergreen
i
didnt
expect
the
spruce
to
come
through
in
aroma
but
it
does
flavor
is
mainly
caramel
malts
very
subtle
spruce
and
a
nice
sweetness
virtually
no
bitterness
the
light
to
medium
body
nice
effervescence
and
a
buttery
sensation
combine
to
produce
a
nice
overall
mouth
feel
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
slight
and
the
drink
provides
a
very
nice
warming
feeling
a
bit
of
sweetness
lingers
in
the
finish
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertase
a
good
winter
beer
but
nothing
id
ever
go
crazy
over
overall
although
it
is
not
your
typical
winter
variety
this
beer
was
crisp
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
i
was
initially
worried
the
spruce
may
be
overpowering
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
there
was
just
enough
to
let
me
know
it
was
in
there
my
overall
feeling
is
meh
from
alaskan
winter
i
like
that
they
put
a
spin
on
the
classic
winter
seasonal
but
i
think
it
is
another
reason
why
so
few
people
live
in
alaska
through
all
four
seasons
one
of
my
favorite
winter
brews
year
after
year
its
very
consistent
and
offers
many
unique
flavors
not
found
in
another
brew
ive
had
this
does
not
feel
like
a
winter
warmer
at
all
more
like
a
sessionable
amber
ale
but
no
complaints
there
tolerable
and
easily
drinkable
so
i
say
good
on
that
i
had
the
alaskan
s
winter
beer
at
carlies
jewels
in
redlands
california
on
tap
strong
reddish
brown
in
color
medium
head
with
little
lacing
strong
malt
and
spruce
flavors
mellow
hop
undertones
definitely
an
evening
session
beer
good
with
barbeque
or
around
a
fire
a
true
winter
warmer
ill
be
getting
a
few
cases
next
winter
for
sure
mf
is
smooth
and
lighter
bodied
very
drinkable
all
in
all
its
a
very
cozy
winter
ale
worthy
of
its
price
and
should
be
simple
enough
for
simple
tastes
and
complex
enough
for
beer
snobs
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
could
be
great
if
they
balanced
this
more
with
a
piny
hop
but
its
cool
to
be
able
to
try
a
spruce
tip
beer
drinkability
good
enough
to
warrant
a
second
tonight
anyway
the
spruce
tips
keep
things
interesting
and
the
body
and
finish
make
for
a
pretty
smooth
ride
not
great
but
worth
a
try
for
the
style
its
too
thin
and
clean
in
character
not
a
big
enough
for
a
winter
warmer
but
its
enjoyable
beer
in
looks
flavor
and
on
the
palette
so
credit
there
quite
drinkable
great
session
beer
it
is
not
in
my
opinion
a
winter
warmer
but
i
do
like
it
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
very
drinkable
and
tasty
the
appearance
is
dark
not
pitch
black
but
dark
smells
very
matly
tiny
bit
spicy
or
tangy
the
taste
is
very
smooth
very
matly
as
well
you
can
taste
an
interesting
flavor
which
im
assuming
is
the
spruce
tips
i
went
through
a
six
pack
of
these
no
problem
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
i
will
get
this
one
again
mf
medium
bodied
without
huge
hop
or
alcohol
character
a
little
sweet
for
warmer
temps
but
i
know
for
a
fact
that
this
is
a
perfectly
sessionable
beer
when
it
is
40º
outside
and
its
dark
18
hours
per
day
overall
a
malty
sweet
wintery
ale
that
is
pleasant
and
a
little
spiced
but
not
very
exciting
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
medium
thin
light
beige
head
that
diminishes
steadily
but
leaves
rows
of
lacing
aroma
of
pine
hops
and
sweet
malt
mediumbodied
with
a
pineyspruce
character
along
with
fresh
fruit
hops
and
malt
flavors
touches
of
spice
are
present
too
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
malty
with
a
fruit
and
spice
aftertaste
decent
overall
they
were
looking
for
something
different
i
think
they
found
it
drinkability
is
kinda
low
because
i
just
really
didnt
like
the
flavor
however
if
you
like
the
flavor
i
could
see
this
being
super
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
has
a
good
taste
that
makes
it
pretty
easy
drinking
its
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
to
try
sometime
sorry
for
the
wasted
seat
rhettroactive
d
way
too
sweet
and
to
be
honest
thats
just
about
all
this
beer
has
going
on
i
like
alaskan
brewing
co
but
did
not
enjoy
this
at
all
not
a
typical
winter
warmer
and
i
was
not
impressed
with
their
interpretation
drinkability
interesting
brew
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
from
a
tap
in
juneau
someday
drink
a
very
sessionable
beer
as
stated
above
need
to
get
another
and
have
it
a
bit
warmer
dont
leave
this
beer
in
the
snow
too
cold
take
it
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
bit
before
you
serve
it
the
coldness
hides
the
spices
im
getting
a
malty
smell
at
first
and
not
much
else
i
also
expect
more
from
a
beer
labeled
alaskan
winter
like
maybe
some
caribou
blood
its
also
labeled
with
spruce
tips
ya
i
get
a
little
spicyspruce
aroma
but
not
enough
to
complement
this
winter
brew
sorry
alaskan
not
impressed
very
interesting
take
on
the
winter
warmer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
definitely
brings
out
the
winter
spirit
with
the
full
body
and
the
huge
flavor
a
very
good
beer
obviously
i
like
this
beer
usually
i
drink
ipas
and
munich
style
hefeweisen
dinteresting
worth
trying
but
not
really
my
style
my
first
winter
warmer
and
i
think
i
was
spoiled
a
very
nice
complex
mixture
of
flavors
balance
out
well
and
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
style
i
can
see
more
of
this
in
my
future
overall
just
a
very
interesting
and
different
flavor
for
a
winter
brew
seems
like
a
nice
amber
with
an
extra
kick
of
some
sweet
sugars
candies
etc
incredibly
drinkable
as
i
stated
in
my
first
paragraph
im
not
big
on
seasonal
beers
certain
porters
and
stouts
not
withstanding
this
in
my
opinion
is
the
best
winter
ale
available
great
session
beer
pours
a
medium
orangeamber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
white
foam
on
top
nicely
spicy
on
the
nose
with
spruce
toasted
malt
and
a
light
pleasant
hoppiness
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
lightbodied
medium
carbonation
with
pale
malt
caramel
and
spruce
finishing
with
a
profound
sweetness
pretty
good
only
four
bucks
for
a
bomber
was
quite
nice
but
i
would
not
really
recommend

d
a
nice
enough
winter
warmer
unique
and
adequately
satisfying
theres
some
good
aromas
and
flavors
present
but
as
a
whole
the
beer
is
a
little
reserved
for
my
preference
a
different
spin
on
the
winter
warmer
and
its
refreshing
to
see
that
the
spruce
is
not
overdone
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
which
makes
this
an
excellent
sunday
dinner
beer
medium
bodied
appropriate
carbonation
very
easy
drinker
for
a
winter
warmer
though
i
feel
it
doesnt
necessarily
fit
the
style
that
well
overall
a
good
ww
that
i
do
recommend
rotation
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
co
trip
if
here
i
might
get
a
single
or
two
or
ontap
during
the
ww
season
oo
overall
not
exactly
a
full
on
flavor
blast
not
very
memorable
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
head
that
leaves
almost
no
lacing
whatsoever
behind
the
smell
has
notes
of
toffee
wheat
pine
needles
and
a
bit
of
subtle
hoppy
citrus
the
taste
has
a
general
malty
sweetness
to
it
along
with
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
some
pine
sap
and
some
spruce
needles
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
has
more
than
enough
carbonation
and
warms
a
bit
as
it
coats
making
for
a
fairly
drinkable
winter
brew
d
im
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
beer
as
i
have
not
seen
it
in
ma
that
being
said
its
not
something
i
will
actively
trade
for
as
other
local
winter
warmers
hold
up
to
this
one
orangeamber
colored
minimal
white
lace
caramel
malt
aroma
with
mild
citircpine
hop
undertone
begins
with
soft
malt
biscuit
and
bread
flavors
dominate
the
midpalate
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
stays
clean
hops
creep
in
toward
the
finish
with
a
muted
but
distinctly
unusual
pine
note
that
must
be
the
spruce
tips
there
are
fleeting
undertones
of
berry
fruit
as
well
flavors
are
understated
and
well
integrated
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
slick
full
but
very
clean
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
its
a
very
well
done
beer
it
is
mild
but
shows
a
lot
of
finesse
d
overall
a
good
not
great
beer
tastes
almost
like
a
lager
and
ale
hybrid
that
grew
on
me
as
the
night
went
on
will
probably
drink
again
but
will
wait
till
next
years
batch
there
is
a
little
warming
from
the
alcohol
so
i
guess
it
has
that
aspect
of
winter
warmer
correct
but
then
again
it
doesnt
claim
to
be
a
warmerthats
what
yall
have
it
categorized
as
this
is
clearly
a
well
i
dunno
what
this
beer
should
be
categorized
as
its
not
dark
or
hoppy
like
most
winter
warmers
but
it
does
have
some
of
the
roasty
qualities
i
dunno
this
beer
is
confused
and
so
am
i
all
i
know
is
that
it
tastes
great
just
dont
try
it
thinking
youre
getting
a
warmer
or
something
sprucey
bottoms
up
have
not
had
this
beer
for
six
or
seven
years
but
liked
it
better
in
the
past
not
bad
but
a
tad
boring
i
remember
this
as
a
littler
darker
more
flavorful
and
around
7
now
it
seems
a
little
closer
to
the
amber
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
a
very
unique
twist
on
beer
d
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
for
sure
overall
give
it
a
shot
if
you
want
add
another
beer
to
your
list
otherwise
avoid
i
love
this
beer
the
only
issue
i
have
with
it
is
that
each
year
the
beers
taste
can
differ
so
much
i
remember
a
year
or
two
ago
it
was
way
to
piney
almost
undrinkable
i
still
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
imo
a
great
beer
by
a
great
company
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
and
if
you
don
enjoy
the
first
time
give
it
another
try
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
winter
warmer
i
liked
the
spruce
theme
but
would
have
appreciated
a
little
bit
more
flavor
overall
since
it
is
closest
brewery
to
me
that
bottles
beer
i
want
to
like
this
and
other
alaskan
brewing
offerings
more
than
i
do
but
i
dont
with
the
exception
of
the
barleywine
and
seasonal
porters
and
some
other
limited
releases
their
beers
tend
to
be
pretty
uninspired
and
average
d
great
winter
warmer
beer
i
would
go
back
to
this
appearance
is
a
slightly
darker
copper
with
a
light
murk
to
it
and
having
not
much
of
a
head
smell
has
a
light
sweet
caramel
and
dark
fruits
taste
has
a
bitter
sweetness
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
light
hop
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
body
and
carbonation
for
what
i
get
for
the
price
its
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
more
carbonation
than
i
would
like
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
update
im
enjoying
this
beer
more
each
time
i
try
it
im
going
to
have
to
get
some
more
im
absolutely
loving
the
flavor
of
this
very
nice
overall
my
favorite
alaskan
amber
and
one
of
my
newest
favorite
beers
ever
d
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
brew
that
is
easily
sessionable
d
not
a
bad
brew
just
a
bit
light
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
sessionable
d
long
story
short
loved
this
beer
in
tucson
2
years
ago
now
ick
really
sweet
and
it
is
a
problem
i
do
remember
getting
the
spruce
needles
smell
from
the
07
version
this
is
sugar
and
carmel
not
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
a
really
good
brewery
but
this
version
is
just
plain
bad
so
glad
i
just
got
a
single
bottle
glassware
pint
drinkability
this
isnt
a
warmer
unless
you
count
the
abv
overall
impressions
a
bit
sweeter
than
id
like
its
not
bad
but
certainly
not
something
id
seek
out
d
good
i
could
have
a
couple
clear
ambertinged
orange
with
a
modest
wet
thin
head
mediocre
retention
and
barely
any
lacing
very
english
aroma
with
lots
of
toffee
and
cookie
maltiness
and
a
christmasy
spiciness
i
dont
get
any
spruce
though
the
flavor
has
a
sweet
graham
crackery
toffee
maltiness
thats
quickly
tempered
by
earthy
hops
and
at
last
a
distinct
but
light
spruce
character
nice
balance
here
in
a
style
that
tends
to
be
rather
sweet
finish
is
pleasantly
dry
nice
mouthfeel
and
uncommon
drinkability
over
all
this
is
a
good
beer
the
drink
ability
is
good
but
nothing
spectacular
one
of
the
lighter
winter
warmers
ive
had
almost
seems
more
like
a
mix
of
a
oktoberfest
and
winter
ale
maybe
novemberfest
would
order
again
price
is
nice
also
that
being
said
a
bunch
of
my
customers
just
loved
this
beer
it
was
one
of
my
best
selling
winter
seasonals
so
what
do
i
know
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
brew
actually
being
very
drinkable
aroma
is
spice
and
malty
sweetness
flavor
is
quite
nice
malts
dominating
and
some
spruce
coming
through
in
the
finish
carbonation
hits
nice
on
the
way
down
which
is
refreshing
good
beer
overall
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
beer
often
if
it
was
offered
in
my
local
area
that
being
said
i
think
that
this
is
a
keeper
and
one
worthy
of
seeking
out
if
you
like
the
winter
warmer
style
sample
in
the
alaskan
tap
room
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
ruddy
amber
color
with
a
medium
thin
light
beige
head
that
diminishes
steadily
stringy
lacing
aroma
of
pine
hops
and
fruit
mediumbodied
with
a
pineyspruce
prevents
scurvy
character
along
with
fresh
fruit
hops
and
malt
flavors
touches
of
spice
are
present
too
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
malty
with
a
fruit
and
spice
aftertaste
decent
overall
d
picked
up
a
sixpack
right
as
the
season
was
ending
i
think
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
winter
warmer
thanks
to
colts9016
for
this
one
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
caramel
malt
in
the
aroma
fairly
rich
malty
flavor
some
slight
fruitiness
more
caramel
malt
flavor
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
add
some
balance
i
didnt
really
get
the
spruce
flavor
decent
winter
warmer
base
pours
a
slightly
fogged
dull
hued
brownish
amber
minimal
head
off
a
soft
pour
nose
is
a
slight
syrupy
thing
with
sweet
leafy
tones
mild
spices
flavor
is
fairly
robust
on
the
spices
with
a
sweet
tone
that
carries
fruit
edges
seems
like
cherries
but
a
subdued
one
i
guess
i
can
see
spruce
tips
in
there
im
a
little
rusty
on
my
spruce
tips
memories
feel
has
a
bit
of
an
attacking
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
a
bit
thick
and
syrupy
overall
a
pretty
hearty
brew
thats
worthy
of
being
called
a
winter
ale
id
prefer
to
drink
this
by
a
fire
easy
to
drink
thats
for
sure
and
pretty
smooth
going
down
nothing
offensive
or
over
the
top
with
this
beer
the
spruce
tips
might
add
something
but
im
not
catching
it
didnt
really
seem
to
be
much
spruciness
but
still
pretty
good
huge
thanks
to
my
wife
for
getting
this
brew
for
me
as
part
of
my
goal
to
sample
a
beer
from
every
state
i
often
find
myself
at
odds
when
it
comes
to
winter
warmers
as
a
style
depending
on
when
you
drink
them
the
spices
flavors
are
different
part
of
the
charm
challenge
i
have
to
say
for
this
brew
i
enjoyed
a
nice
lightly
balanced
caramel
grainy
brew
with
a
pleasant
accent
of
spices
and
a
woody
note
which
ill
attribute
to
spruce
but
profess
to
not
having
sampled
any
other
spruce
type
product
over
the
past
years
for
which
to
compare
this
to
i
could
see
getting
a
6
pack
each
december
and
enjoying
as
part
of
the
holiday
season

clear
under

large
retentive
and
loose
initially
fluffy
dark
tan
head
and
leaving
all
kinds
of
thick
lacing
mild
sweet
maple
infused
nose
im
not
getting
much
spice
or
the
advertized
spruce
here
just
a
malty
ale
lacking
in
much
complexity
or
intrigue
im
getting
more
maple
toastyness
and
thats
about
it
one
and
done
for
me
of
this
one
overall
there
is
a
creamy
mouth
feel
that
is
slightly
astringent
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
finish
and
lingers
on
the
palate
i
felt
that
beer
was
more
an
amber
ale
with
a
little
more
hops
i
was
hoping
for
a
warming
feeling
from
the
beer
but
i
didnt
get
any
it
has
a
good
malty
backbone
but
it
is
not
very
heavy
and
hoppy
it
is
a
really
good
beer
but
not
great
overall
good
winter
seasonal
i
am
not
usually
crazy
about
this
style
but
this
one
is
ok
overall
its
a
pleasant
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
was
content
with
just
one
bottle
d
this
is
a
good
session
brew
that
might
pair
well
with
fruitcake
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
i
loves
me
some
fruitcake
lightly
spiced
mellow
on
the
hops
they
are
there
for
sure
but
not
the
star
of
the
show
and
focused
on
a
fruity
christmas
cheer
flavor
combined
with
tingly
menthollike
spruce
worth
a
try
for
the
spruce
uniqueness
aspect
and
worth
going
back
to
for
that
mintyfresh
almost
hoppy
quality
of
the
spruce
it
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
it
was
good
but
not
a
home
run
with
me
i
wasnt
wild
about
the
spruce
tips
overall
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
would
not
have
minded
throwing
down
another
one
of
in
heartbeat
thanks
goes
to
flexabull
for
providing
this
as
a
secret
santa
gift
d
this
is
interesting
and
easy
drinking
the
spruce
is
a
unique
touch
but
i
dont
know
if
its
my
favorite
yet
i
keep
getting
disappointed
by
alaskans
beers
they
seem
to
feel
a
bit
out
of
whack
this
beer
tastes
somewhat
like
spruce
but
its
not
an
altogether
pleasant
taste
and
i
dont
really
get
why
its
there
the
beer
isnt
rich
or
balanced
enough
to
take
on
the
spruce
flavor
alaskan
calls
it
an
english
old
ale
which
sets
it
up
for
some
unfortunate
comparisons
as
there
are
some
very
big
and
excellent
old
ales
out
there
thats
a
refined
category
of
subtle
handcrafted
ales
this
beer
is
none
of
those
things
oh
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
borders
on
mediocrity
theres
some
sweet
malt
and
some
mild
hops
with
a
touch
of
spice
nothing
really
comes
together
though
the
taste
is
not
balanced
to
begin
with
and
the
spruce
just
further
knocks
things
off
course
the
individual
flavors
are
all
pretty
good
they
just
dont
really
work
together
for
my
palate
this
beer
is
trying
too
hard
at
being
a
winter
seasonal
and
needs
to
work
on
just
being
good
beer
nice
deep
gold
pour
and
aroma
of
malts
and
trees
the
flavor
is
good
but
the
spruce
tips
are
kind
of
strange
deep
and
malty
with
some
caramel
but
then
a
blast
of
turpentine
i
wish
they
would
have
just
thrown
in
more
hops
instead
the
spruce
was
not
a
good
substitute

thanks
nice
golden
color
with
teh
strangest
aroma
of
what
i
take
must
be
spruce
its
like
pine
mixed
with
licorice
huh
the
flavor
is
also
strange
but
surprisingly
good
the
flavor
is
very
hard
to
describe
as
i
have
not
tasted
anything
like
it
but
weak
licorice
comes
to
mind
and
a
hint
of
malt
this
was
interesting
and
very
easy
to
drink
taste
mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
faint
herbal
quality
very
clean
and
malty
only
faintly
bitter
in
the
finish
im
not
getting
much
spruce
in
the
flavor
or
much
complexity
at
all
for
that
matter
im
not
really
sure
where
the
brewer
was
going
with
this
its
pleasantly
malty
but
fairly
flatline
lacking
in
any
sort
of
variation

start
to
finish

drinkability
i
like
this
beer
i
do
unfortunately
it
gives
me
a
headache
every
time
i
have
one
im
guessing
some
kind
of
reaction
to
the
spruce
tips
im
not
going
to
mark
it
lower
for
this
fact
but
give
out
the
warning
that
it
may
cause
a
similar
reaction
in
others
this
ale
is
far
too
light
too
sweet
and
too
tame
to
be
a
proper
winter
warmer
while
still
an
ok
drinkable
ale
the
spruce
is
underutilized
and
the
ale
borders
on
macro
in
its
timidness
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
spruce
could
have
been
easily
overused
to
create
a
somewhat
gimmicky
brew
but
it
gives
this
one
a
clear
fresh
taste
liked
the
restraint
here
its
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
and
the
spruce
and
the
hops
give
it
a
piney
finish
the
alcohol
is
present
both
in
the
taste
and
aroma
and
warmed
me
up
a
bit
really
liked
the
balance
and
restraint
with
all
the
good
flavors
to
put
together
an
enjoyable
brew
not
your
regular
winter
warmer
this
one
definitely
has
some
spruce
kick
and
its
sweet
and
malty
no
question
not
hints
of
sweetness
and
spruce
but
in
your
face
sweet
malt
and
spruce
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
malty
and
piney
brew
this
is
perfect
definitely
worth
a
shot
in
the
exploration
of
winter
brews

overall

sweet
for
me
with
some

id
prefer
more

poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
golden
amber
coloration
beer
gives
a
full
foam
and
reduces
to
a
lingering
lacing
there
is
a
good
malt
aroma
that
odorizes
the
air
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
with
a
distinct
taste
that
warms
your
interior
has
a
outdoors
sort
of
taste
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
by
alaskan
brewing
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
pours
a
clear
orange

copper
color
with
a
thin
white

smell
is
mostly
malty
with
some
spiced
character
in
the
way
of
the
spruce
tips
im
guessing
taste
is
malty
and
refreshingly
minty
almost
and
cool
feeling
in
the
mouth
unique
mouthfeel
and
flavor
but
not
particularly
fantastic
either
medium
to
thin
bodied
and
somewhat
easy
drinking
drinkability
decent
session
potential
glad
to
have
the
chance
but
ill
save
the
other
bottle
for
someone
else
whod
like
to
try
it
the
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
beer
is
enjoyable
and
interesting
although
it
would
not
be
unpleasant
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
session
it
wouldnt
be
something
i
would
do
pours
clear
and
very
bright
a
highlightflecked
medium
amber
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
only
a
collar
the
nose
displays
some
buttery
diacetyl
and
a
vague
hint
of
something
that
reminds
of
refreshment
but
is
too
vague
and
subdued
to
present
itself
as
an
identifiable
aroma
on
the
palate
rich
buttery
malts
and
a
twang
of
slight
fruitiness
toward
the
end
with
some
metallic
notes
cropping
up
as
well
whatever
spruce
characteristic
there
is
is
very
subtle
too
subtle
in
fact
for
me
to
detect
mouthfeel
is
fairly
nondescript
but
by
no
means
bad
malty
but
not
slick
little
acidity
medium
carbonation
that
is
unassuming
overall
this
is
a
perfectly
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
impression
a
malty
lightly
spiced
winter
ale
nothing
over
the
top
in
terms
of
spices
a
very
clean
good
winter
ale
recommended
i
really
dig
the
spruce
flavours
and
they
combine
well
with
the
sweet
malts
to
provide
a
nicely
balanced
winter
warmer
that
reminds
me
of
a
nice
christmas
treat
i
could
definitely
take
down
another
of
these
drinks
too
easy
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
some
of
the
flavor
here
but
i
think
i
could
happily
session
on
this
the
spruce
tips
are
a
nice
addition
taste
is
nice
sweet
with
a
gingerbreaddy
nutty
flavor
and
malty
too
a
bit
thick
but
not
cloyingly
so
smooth
and
drinkable
poured
a
nice
copper
color
but
had
no
head
to
speak
of
really
just
kind
of
flat
the
smell
was
very
sweet
with
spices
and
an
overriding
maltiness
that
was
a
bit
overpowering
flavorwise
the
beer
was
pretty
thick
and
malty
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
the
mentioned
spruce
tips
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
very
end
to
add
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
guess
i
like
my
winter
beers
a
bit
more
hoppy
and
not
so
sweet
as
this
one
recommended
if
you
are
a
malthead
da
great
unique
winter
offering
easy
to
consume
even
for
the
person
who
may
think
they
do
not
like
conifers
in
their
beer
of
which
i
am
not
one
pours
a
four
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace

city

is
average
it
is
a
smooth
beer
easy
to
go
down
but
the
overall
taste
was
not
that
appealing
to
me
im
glad
i
got
to
try
the
beer
thank
you
nitrogen
as
it
was
an
interesting
brew
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
go
back
to
it
pours
a
bright
amber
hue
with
minimal
head
and
slightly
above
average
lacing
on
my
glass
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
heading
to
the
surface
in
this
brew
i
am
not
really
sure
if
i
am
smelling
hops
or
the
spruce
needles
its
isnt
quite
strong
enough
for
hops
but
its
a
pleasant
citrus
scent
with
some
biscuty
malt
coming
to
my
nose
this
beer
is
actually
quite
sweet
the
malty
sweetness
overpowers
the
bitterness
coming
from
the
finishing
hops
flavors
of
citrus
and
sweet
caramel
meld
fairly
well
in
this
beer
just
leaning
towards
sweeter
than
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbination
slightly
watery
and
medium
bodied
the
alcohol
is
also
fairly
well
masked
in
the
beer
and
doesnt
really
make
an
appearance
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
purchase
this
again
if
i
had
the
chance
md
somewhat
oily
in
the
mouth
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
different
and
i
personally
wouldnt
go
for
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
drinkability
spruce
or
no
spruce
its
still
a
decent
beer
this
beer
had
an
aroma
i
couldnt
quit
make
out
at
first
i
thought
it
may
be
blueberriesbut
then
realized
it
must
be
the
spruce
tips
the
head
didnt
last
too
long
not
sure
if
it
was
my
glass
or
not
really
enjoyed
the
taste
very
refreshing
with
the
right
amount
of

give
it

good
beer
but
too
many
can
give
u
some
gnarly
heartburn
the

it
is
much

light
copperamberish

thin
head
but
still
seems
to
be
sticking
to
the

just
fine
fairily

but
still
a
little
flowery
if
you
breath
deep
the
taste
is
crisp
begining
to
end
the
spruce
flavour
starts
off
subtle
and
then
peaks
just
before
the
long
slightily
bitey
finish
a
very
cool
truely
alaskan
brew
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
upon
it
now
i
know
the
reason
why
i
gain
10
lbs
every
year
around
this
time
note
to
self
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
beer
d
could
see
having
a
n
umber
of
these
as
they
are
bright
unique
in
taste
and
not
likely
to
cut
one
off
at
the
knees
after
a
few
this
is
another
pnw
winter
ale
i
buy
every
year
but
every
time
i
ask
why
shortly
answer
myself
and
say
because
it
can
be
alot
better
this
brew
is
certainly
worth
trying
more
than
once
but
if
i
bought
a
6pack
at
least
3
would
be
sitting
around
until
i
pawned
them
off
on
friends
that
said
for
whatever
reason
i
have
a
hard
time
having
more
than
one
of
these
its
pretty
light
for
the
style
so
thats
not
the
problem
for
whatever
reason
this
doesnt
appeal
to
me
in
the
same
way
that
many
warmers
do
maybe
it
could
use
some
more
complexity
in
either
the
hops
or
malts
anyway
its
my
first
abc
beer
and
im
excited
to
try
some
more
of
their
products
soon
as
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
golden
brown
color
light
head
that
fades
quickly
not
quite
as
dark
a
i
thought
it
would
be
smells
sweet
pine
it
just
smells
like
a
really
nice
brisk
day
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
like
it
alot
tastes
very
sweet
pine
comes
through
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
yet
tart
enough
to
assert
itself
as
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
i
dont
really
get
the
the
winter
warming
effect
from
this
beer
though
just
a
little
too
sweet
really
doubt
i
will
return
to
this
one
drinkability
uniquely
alaskan
good
but
not
designed
for
mass
consumption
the
spruce
flavor
gets
to
me
after
a
couple
overall
this
beer
is
supposed
to
a
winter
warmer
but
im
just
not
feelin
it
on
this
one
in
some
ways
it
almost
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
but
more
spicey
i
dont
know
about
this
seasonal
i
mean
its
not
bad
by
any
meanscertainly
notbut
theres
plenty
of
other
beers
id
rather
be
drinking
when
im
feeling
brisk
and
when
the
holidays
come
around
i
might
have
to
make
a
trek
up
to
wyoming
for
more
of
this
alaskan
is
a
good
brewery
this
beer
does
not
conjure
up
images
of
yuletide
cheer
i
enjoy
alaskan
brewery
they
should
replace
the
smoked
porter
for
their
winter
warmer
this
is
an
ok
beer
to
drink
just
dont
think
festive
holiday
ive
enjoyed
other
selections
from
alaskan
and
while
this
certainly
has
the
winter
warmer
part
down
i
cant
get
into
it
though
winter
warmers
arent
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
one
goes
a
bit
beyond
that
excessively
sweet
and
a
bit
odd
not
one
for
me
to
repeat
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
then
i
think
i
would
have
enough
of
the
tree
flavor
for
awhile
not
a
great
session
beer
for
me
but
i
will
certainly
keep
them
around
all
winter
for
an
evening
beverage
on
occasion
good
one
to
serve
guests
as
well
this
beer
poured
a
nice
copper
color
but
had
no
head
to
speak
of
really
just
kind
of
flat
the
smell
was
very
sweet
with
spices
and
an
overriding
maltiness
that
was
a
bit
overpowering
flavorwise
the
beer
was
pretty
thick
and
malty
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
the
mentioned
spruce
tips
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
very
end
to
add
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
guess
i
like
my
winter
beers
a
bit
more
hoppy
and
not
so
sweet
as
this
one
recommended
if
you
are
a
malthead
d
i
love
alaskan
amber
and
tried
this
fro
the
first
time
last
year
took
me
till
this
year
to
review
it
is
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
cool
night
i
looked
forward
to
this
coming
out
so
i
will
have
to
get
my
fill
before
it
disappears
until
next
year
good
thing
that
this
is
just
the
start
of
the
season
for
this
beer
12
oz
bottle
from
vons
winter
2007
release
poured
a
rich
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
faded
to
18
inch
aroma
was
light
with
sweet
malts
red
fruits
and
almonds
the
flavor
was
rich
with
malts
and
a
large
dosing
of
cherries
and
raspberries
mouthfeel
was
very
full
creamy
and
heavy
this
is
a
beer
you
can
almost
chew
the
finish
fell
short
and
showed
just
a
trace
of
piney
hops
and
some
alcohol
but
thankfully
their
was
no
lingering
sweetness
which
i
had
anticipated
by
this
point
overall
this
is
a
most
pleasantly
original
brewmy
congrats
to
alaskan
recommended
honestly
one
of
the
first
winter
warmers
marketed
as
such
that
ive
really
liked
a
little
stronger
but
without
the
usual
bombs
of
hopping
and
burnt
malts
goes
down
easy
and
actually
does
warm
you
up
a
little
nothing
to
get
excited
about
though
as
a
proper
oldworld
beer
would
suffice
and
do
so
with
more
flavour
this
is
a
relatively
rich
and
slightly
warming
from
alcohol
beer
understandable
to
be
offered
during
the
winter
could
not
drink
much
of
these
because
they
are
so
thick
and
sweet
d
an
immensely
complex
yet
drinkable
ale
even
in
the
summer
the
spruce
adds
a
pagan
air
to
this
beer
one
of
my
favourite
winter
warmers
a
great
beer
drinkability
perhaps
the
recipe
has
been
tweaked
but
i
like
this
now
2010
much
better
than
when
i
originally
tried
it
in
2007
this
is
just
an
incredibly
well
made
brew
any
way
you
look
at
it
da
i
dont
know
this
one
was
interesting
for
the
spruce
tips
ellement
but
overall
nothing
fancy
if
this
was
all
i
had
on
a
very
stormy
night
i
wouldnt
complain
too
much
d
im
just
mad
that
this
is
a
winter
release
i
could
drink
this
during
all
four
seasons
i
cant
believe
that
the
abv
is
that
high
because
i
felt
this
was
a
very
light
tasting
brew
maybe
i
should
give
the
stouts
a
rest
and
seek
out
a
few
more
like
this
the
alaskan
brewing
co
has
done
it
again
very
well
done
its
easily
one
of
the
most
unique
and
drinkable
winter
brews
ive
had
this
year
or
any
year
seriously
try
this
out
drink
a
tree
drinkability
an
overall
good
tasting
brew
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
ive
heard
good
things
of
alaskan
brewing
and
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
sampled
from
their
brewery
unfourtunately
it
didnt
make
as
good
of
a
first
impression
as
i
was
expecting
i
was
bumed
about
this
brew
but
it
shouldnt
stop
me
from
trying
thier
other
products
d
undoubtedly
a
session
taste
a
touch
of
smoke
first
then
darkened
walnuts
burnt
sugar
a
medium
body
and
drying
mouthfeel
an
alcohol
bite
leads
into
the
drier
mouthfeel
theres
nice
fresh
apple
ester
this
is
surprisingly
dry
considering
the
richness
of
the
malt
the
dryness
is
in
contrast
to
the
caramel
theres
woody
quality
to
this
i
feel
like
im
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
i
also
feel
like
pouring
a
scotch
interesting
this
is
fantastic
the
sour
hopsspruce
are
a
nice
accent
super
drinkable
this
ones
a
bit
flat
perhaps
the
sample
rather
than
the
intended
outcome
or
i
would
rank
it
even
higher
but
even
though
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
christmas
beers
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
every
year
poured
in
a
pint
glass
the
alaskan
winter
ale
is
a
bright
clear
copper
with
a
large
light
tan
head
that
quickly
subsided
to
a
very
slight
collar
and
left
minimal
lace
the
aroma
is
bright
maybe
too
sweet
piney
fruity
and
a
noticeable
amount
of
alcohol
as
mentioned
on
the
bottle
that
dominant
aroma
is
spruce
tips
the
taste
is
a
bit
cloying
but
nice
more
of
a
fruity
bubblegum
with
a
firm
malt
backbone
and
bitter
hop
finish
then
the
dominate
spruce
in
the
aroma
but
make
no
mistake
it
is
certainly
there
i
just
think
it
is
really
nicely
balanced
much
more
then
the
aroma
would
leave
you
to
believe
my
taste
runs
towards
sweeter
extreme
tasting
to
beers
so
consider
that
when
i
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
one
only
complaint
would
be
the
the
aftertaste
looses
the
balance
and
can
be
a
bit
sprucy
but
it
creeps
on
you
slowly
the
mouthfeel
was
perfect
and
it
was
one
the
most
drinkable
winter
ales
ive
at
least
from
this
country
i
never
had
more
then
2
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
id
guess
theyd
session
quite
nicely
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
very
filling
considering
the
style
this
is
good
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
that
might
not
necessarily
be
too
cold
this
one
is
perfect
when
you
crave
the
style
but
dont
want
a
beer
thats
too
heavy
d
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
easy
to
drink
moderate
abv
interesting
flavors
i
could
see
making
this
a
regular
addition
to
the
drinking
lineup
in
the
winter
recommended
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
nice
carbonation
small
fizzy
tan
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
hops
spices
spruce
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
highly
carbonated
malty
tastes
like
cherries
but
could
be
the
spruce
lightmedium
body
very
drinkable
a
nice
little
winter
warmer
from
alaskan
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
12oz
bottle
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
some
slow
bubbles
very
little
head
and
not
much
lacing
not
much
of
an
aroma
in
this
with
faint
scents
of
alcohol
hops
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
not
very
pleasing
to
me
i
taste
a
blend
of
pine
with
some
sweet
sour
spice
and
bitter
notes
with
nothing
that
stands
out
on
its
own
mouth
feel
is
about
the
only
thing
i
like
in
this
beer
i
would
probably
try
this
brew
one
more
time
in
the
future
just
to
make
sure
it
doesnt
taste
as
bad
as
this
one
pours
a
pretty
copper
color
topped
by
a
small
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
light
spruce
and
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
bubble
gum
esters
palate
is
a
blend
of
caramel
and
dark
malts
up
front
imparting
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
the
spruce
comes
through
after
a
few
sips
along
with
more
bubble
gum
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
lingers
on
the
finish
body
is
substantial
and
creamy
a
nice
winter
ale
that
differentiates
itself
from
the
crowd
still
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
year
drinkability
its
a
good
winter
warmer
but
the
tealike
flavor
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
for
me
to
want
to
drink
this
regularly
a
good
winter
beer
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
a
cold
day
probably
one
of
the
best
warmers
that
ive
had
d
this
is
the
best
winter
warmer
that
ive
come
across
reminding
me
of
a
fresh
finnish
sahti
edit
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
second
bottle
this
beer
did
start
to
grow
on
me
im
raising
the
taste
score
from
2
to
3
i
still
dont
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
if
you
stick
with
it
its
not
bad
notes
what
a
night
im
2
for
2
tonight
on
winter
warmers
this
is
another
fine
example
although
it
is
subtle
in
the
malt
department
compared
to
most
the
spices
are
mellow
compared
to
most
it
works
though
because
of
the
hops
and
the
earthiness
it
gains
from
the
malt
bill
and
tree
trimmings
above
average
d
well
this
beer
isnt
so
bad
im
sure
the
carbonation
was
simply
off
in
my
bottle
but
i
have
to
judge
whats
in
front
of
me
flavor
was
a
little
fruity
but
ok
nothing
besides
the
carbonation
really
turns
me
off
its
sweet
but
not
so
sweet
that
its
cloying
the
body
is
dry
and
the
chalky
flavor
is
a
real
deterrent
in
the
beer
carbonation
is
a
little
low
but
acceptable
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
maybe
this
beer
has
seen
too
much
winter
but
i
could
see
real
improvement
for
this
beer
in
the
future
this
ones
okay
interesting
the
way
the
spruce
plays
out
in
this
one
my
precious
drinkability
i
think
its
still
too
early
for
winter
warmers
but
even
so
ill
drink
this
is
because
it
hits
the
spot
since
joining
ba
ive
only
had
my
favorite
beers
more
than
a
couple
times
this
is
on
the
favorite
list
not
because
its
one
of
the
best
but
because
its
my
favorite
at
the
local
pizza
place
right
now
this
satisfies
my
malt
cravings
without
destroying
my
tastebuds
with
hops
i
really
like
alaskan
amber
and
smoked
porter
but
i
can
do
without
this
one
fullbodied
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
very
smooth
creamy
warm
and
a
little
chewy
as
well
definitely
a
good
brew
without
being
too
sweet
highly
drinkable
though
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
epilogue
i
really
would
recommend
letting
this
one
sit
for
about
10
minutes
before
drinking
it
i
shouldve
known
better
really
as
it
warmed
up
the
caramel
and
fruit
notes
really
came
out
ive
upped
my
ratings
because
of
this
definitely
a
worthwhile
brew
still
new
to
the
beer
scene
well
the
good
beer
scene
but
this
has
a
very
interesting
taste
very
nice
color
and
smell
good
spicy
almost
aftertaste
can
also
detect
some
fruity
flavors
hidden
away
nice
warming
effect
due
to
it
being
cold
in
here
and
a
nice
high
abv
content
clear
copper
colour
in
the
glass
big
bubbly
head
that
quickly
shrunk
down
to
a
thin
white
layer
minimal
lacing
strong
sweet
aroma
fruity
and
malty
sweet
malt
flavours
to
start
fruity
caramel
and
spicy
with
a
bit
of
pine
dry
clean
finish
but
slightly
tangy
a
slight
warming
affect
from
the
higher
abv
very
enjoyable
aroma
is
not
really
present
to
any
great
degree
other
than
some
vague
maltiness
pale
copper
in
color
with
a
well
established
white
head
that
is
mostly
lasting
has
a
sort
of
candy
sugar
powder
bubble
gum
sweetness
in
the
fore
not
getting
any
spice
just
that
very
sugary
sweetness
and
malt
which
makes
it
not
so
winter
warmery
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
and
am
enjoying
the
last
one
now
would
have
no
problem
buying
or
enjoying
it
again
in
the
future
cheers
pine
and
honey
are
strong
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
unique
and
herbal
much
like
a
gruit
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
and
fairly
sharp
while
drinkability
is
good
this
poured
with
a
big
thick
offwhitetan
head
it
had
good
clarity
in
a
deepamber
colored
beer
the
nose
was
highly
malty
and
sweet
the
mouthfell
was
slightly
thick
with
a
sugary
finish
i
got
a
lot
of
berrylike
sweetness
in
the
mouth
much
like
raspberries
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
i
would
have
no
problem
opening
again
last
swigs
reminds
me
of
clipper
city
below
decks
barelywine
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
the
bottle
nice
on
the
tongue
and
very
drinkable
mostly
a
sipping
beer
due
to
the
6
4
abv
pours
light
golden
in
color
the
aroma
is
equally
light
i
had
to
shove
my
sniffer
deep
into
the
glass
to
perceive
the
soft
semisweet
aroma
the
flavor
begins
piney
followed
by
semisweet
malt
and
then
a
bitterness
finishes
things
off
the
mouthfeel
and
overall
drinkability
is
easy
but
not
terribly
exciting
clear
copper
with
just
a
little
bit
of
head
nice
aroma
with
spruce
some
oak
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
spruce
is
also
prevalent
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
fruit
and
spiciness
rounding
out
the
flavor
the
taste
seems
to
be
a
little
stronger
than
when
i
had
this
on
tap
i
thought
that
this
could
have
been
a
little
more
full
bodied
but
the
carbonation
was
nice
a
nice
winter
session
beer
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
its
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
if
you
like
a
fruity
beer
or
a
lambic
this
one
might
be
for
you
overall
a
great
classic
winter
warmer
so
far
my
favorite
alaskan
brew
definitely
try
this
one
barely
any
head
after
the
pour
color
is
deep
copper
it
just
looks
a
bit
flat
smell
is
faint
fruity
apple
mildly
alcoholic
the
taste
is
tangy
sweet
at
first
with
hints
of
apple
raspberry
and
spices
the
finish
has
bit
of
a
honeylike
flavor
and
then
it
dissipates
into
nothing
not
bitter
alcohol
doesnt
appear
that
strongly
some
interesting
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
but
it
doesnt
come
together
to
be
that
enticing
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
although
the
carbonation
seems
adequate
on
the
palate
unique
taste
but
it
still
doesnt
make
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
didnt
like
this
one
it
makes
my
face
pucker
and
makes
me
feel
sick
to
my
stomach
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
these
and
could
only
manage
to
drink
three
on
subsequent
evenings
trying
to
drink
two
in
a
row
just
would
not
fly
still
one
of
the
best
the
beer
after
its
extraction
from
the
stubby
12ounce
brown
bottle
set
in
the
glass
a
cloudless
brown
with
a
personable
offwhite
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
as
it
dissolves
the
residual
lace
a
velum
like
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
s
sweet
with
caramel
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
nice
malt
earthiness
i
find
appealing
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
splendid
grain
presence
the
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
moderately
acidic
the
hops
spicy
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
very
dry
lingering
aftertaste
sure
glad
that
alaskan
beers
are
readily
available
here
now
and
quite
a
drinkable
beer
for
a
quiet
sunday
afternoon
overall
a
very
enjoyable
experience
which
would
have
been
much
much
better
if
thered
been
a
lot
more
carbonation
if
thered
been
a
sparkle
to
each
sip
it
would
have
highlighted
the
fruit
character
more
without
becoming
overly
sweet
and
the
acid
from
the
co2
would
have
tarted
up
the
flavors
a
bit
despite
these
flaws
id
still
rate
it
high
on
drinkability
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
bottle
and
id
be
inclined
to
recommend
this
to
friends
pours
a
nice
shiny
amber
clear
enough
to
almost
expect
to
find
a
mosquito
from
the
jurassic
period
in
my
pint
glass
smells
of
caramel
with
a
hint
of
hopspruce
tip
spiciness
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
most
likely
a
tongue
tingling
combo
of
lightly
fruity
hops
and
the
spruce
tips
this
beer
claims
to
be
brewed
with
mellows
out
into
nutty
caramel
malts
with
a
lingering
bitterness
probably
the
first
of
the
winter
warmer
style
that
ive
had
where
the
thought
popped
into
my
head
that
it
could
easily
be
a
yearround
beer
even
though
i
wouldnt
drink
it
that
much
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
batch
with
a
heartier
malt
profile
would
be
more
intersting
the
beer
poured
a
nice
paler
amber
color
with
some
medium
visible
carbonation
and
a
white
head
with
little
to
no
retention
the
nose
had
the
expected
spruce
characte
along
with
a
caramel
character
and
faint
fruitiness
to
it
the
beer
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
smooth
taste
while
in
the
mouth
the
finish
and
after
taste
are
of
much
greater
note
a
dry
spruce
induced
finished
lingers
on
the
palate
for
quite
a
time
after
taking
a
sip
this
is
a
unique
brew
not
one
that
i
could
or
would
particularly
drink
many
in
one
sitting
as
a
winter
warmer
there
are
better
examples
but
in
a
style
where
there
is
so
much
deviation
and
lack
of
one
unifying
theme
i
choose
others
like
deschutes
jubelale
simply
on
personal
preference
poures
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
that
is
gone
pretty
quickly
leaving
no
lace
behind
as
it
settlesvery
muted
aromas
i
picked
up
some
toasted
cracker
malt
but
no
hopping
or
spruce
tip
aromas
wich
i
expected
maybe
a
touch
of
caramel
as
well
but
very
light
flavors
are
not
as
muted
but
dont
really
stand
out
much
either
a
dry
malt
base
with
some
buttery
notes
wich
become
stronger
as
i
drink
more
only
a
touch
of
the
pine
flavors
hit
in
the
finish
i
realley
prefer
siletz
spruce
ale
compared
to
thisits
not
horrible
but
somewhat
run
of
the
mill
poured
from
bottle
a
light
amber
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
off
white
head
smell
is
a
little
bit
funky
a
metallic
like
scent
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
a
nutty
flavor
at
first
with
a
slight
bitter
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
i
would
say
low
to
medium
bodied
goes
down
very
easy
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
never
had
one
with
spruce
tips
in
it
before
i
dont
believe
another
strong
offering
by
alaskan
ive
had
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
so
far
one
i
enjoyed
the
other
not
so
much
the
first
one
went
down
very
agreeably
with
a
lamb
chop
shoulder
in
a
kolsch
deglaze
reduction
yum
and
i
found
the
maltiness
and
slight
aromatic
qualities
to
be
an
excellent
pairing
with
the
lamb
i
found
a
slight
impression
of
raspberry
along
with
a
lingering
pineyness
in
the
aftertaste
im
not
entirely
certain
what
was
different
besides
the
lack
of
a
lab
chop
with
the
next
bottle
but
it
became
cloying
and
vaguely
obnoxious
im
willing
to
try
it
again
better
bei
got
a
sixer
pine
tar
is
great
for
a
baseball
bat
but
makes
beer
taste
horrible
i
bought
a
six
pack
for
a
social
event
and
drank
one
of
these
with
the
impression
of
yes
indeed
they
put
a
spruce
tree
in
that
beer
alright
i
tried
to
sucker
in
a
few
of
the
other
guests
but
ended
up
leaving
the
five
orphans
to
fend
for
themselves
for
all
i
know
theyre
still
in
need
of
a
drinker
brew
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
is
retaining
well
nose
is
of
malts
with
the
spruce
tips
ever
so
faintly
present
nice
unique
touch
taste
is
a
blast
of
malts
with
a
strong
nutty
presence
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
presence
of
a
taste
that
is
perhaps
raspberries
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
is
nicely
carbonated
overall
drinkability
is
good
the
abv
is
right
in
line
with
most
other
winter
warmers
and
more
than
one
can
be
enjoyed
in
a
sitting
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
nice
white
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
a
subtle
mix
of
spices
taste
is
a
mix
between
sweet
malt
and
a
subtle
mix
of
spices
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
i
cant
say
that
i
really
tasted
the
spruce
tips
i
believe
i
would
have
appreciated
this
better
with
a
stronger
presence
of
spices
this
is
a
perfectly
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
much
more
distinctive
winter
beers
to
have
that
are
available
right
now
i
wont
turn
this
down
but
theres
lots
of
winter
seasonals
to
look
for
before
this
one
ps
i
also
had
this
on
tap
yesterday
and
my
overall
impression
of
it
was
that
it
was
slightly
more
intense
on
all
counts
and
would
score
a
slightly
higher
score
drinkability
a
pleasant
enough
beer
marks
improve
considerably
if
you
drink
this
closer
to
room
temp
than
ice
cold
the
mouthfeel
is
kinda
chewy
and
buttery
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
winter
brews
very
brassy
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
like
a
house
at
christmas
time
you
can
tell
there
is
a
tree
in
the
other
room
and
that
someone
has
been
backing
perhaps
even
some
mulled
wine
on
the
stove
some
initial
malt
flavors
followed
by
big
hop
character
piney
and
citrus
rind
spurs
tips
not
as
overpowering
as
one
might
expect
add
subtle
tones
that
are
very
nice
a
bit
too
carbonated
fees
a
little
fuzzy
and
harsh
yet
bitersweet
lingering
flavors
call
for
the
next
sip
this
is
quite
the
alluring
beer
pours
an
attractive
copperybrass
color
with
a
small
head
and
tight
carbonation
tastes
like
many
other
winter
warmers
however
the
bottle
says
it
is
brewed
with
spruce
tips
and
i
this
characteristic
comes
through
i
think
not
as
woodsy
or
piney
as
i
would
have
expected
but
almost
like
a
reaspberry
fruitiness
in
fact
this
reminds
me
alot
of
the
flavor
of
berkshire
brewings
raspberry
strong
ale
though
not
quite
as
malty
sweet
and
raspberry
filled
it
has
a
good
crisp
snappy
hop
finish
that
keeps
it
dry
enough
to
avoid
a
cloying
flavor
a
winter
warmer
that
i
would
certainly
enjoy
a
few
pints
of
in
the
winter
if
it
were
available
near
me
the
beer
poured
amber
colored
with
an
offwhite
one
finger
head
with
light
retention
and
light
lacing
the
smell
was
yeasty
and
grainy
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
the
taste
was
somewhat
nutty
and
focused
on
the
malts
but
was
overly
grainy
like
cheap
adjuncts
had
been
used
there
were
hints
of
light
citrus
the
averagelength
finish
ended
with
a
slightly
sour
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
and
mediumbodied
and
somewhat
watery
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
after
this
tasting
tastes
great
mildly
sweet
like
a
spicy
candy
with
a
delicate
touch
of
malts
and
some
nice
winter
hops
spruced
up
with
cinnamon
so
brisk
and
relaxing
definitely
something
to
look
forward
to
every
winter
by
far
the
best
winter
i
have
experienced
and
i
would
really
enjoy
this
one
during
the
winter
months
trade
anyone
very
drinkable
very
agreeable
beer
for
the
style
indeed
overall
a
very
nice
beer
just
what
i
would
expect
from
alaskan
alaskans
winter
ale
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body
with
amber
and
gold
highlights
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
ivory
foam
that
unfortunately
fades
rather
shortly
and
leaves
little
lacing
the
nose
offers
gentle
wafts
of
sweetish
biscuity
caramellaced
malt
and
in
the
mouth
its
delicately
crisp
and
then
smooth
the
flavor
delivers
the
same
maltiness
found
in
the
nose
balanced
by
a
mild
brush
of
drying
spruce
that
appears
across
the
middle
and
lingers
mildly
in
the
finish
its
bitterness
is
restrained
and
the
spicing
is
far
from
overdone
well
worth
trying
a
clean
bright
coppery
amber
beer
has
a
small
biege
head
the
aroma
is
a
light
malt
with
a
hint
of
a
fruity
sweetness
in
the
background
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
quick
spiciness
that
moves
right
into
a
malt
sweetness
the
finish
has
some
interesting
toffee
and
licorice
notes
to
hug
your
tongue
at
the
end
alaskan
winter
ale
is
an
interesting
winter
warmer
and
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
its
pretty
good
though
and
in
the
end
i
like
it
a
little
more
than
my
final
score
would
indicate
i
just
might
give
it
another
go
next
winter
bright
orangey
color
with
no
head
at
all
and
no
lace
as
well
aroma
is
malty
with
hints
of
spruce
very
sweet
malty
fruity
taste
i
liked
that
it
wasnt
spicy
like
a
lot
of
winter
ales
pretty
drinkable
as
well
dont
feel
that
a
winter
beer
has
to
knock
you
on
your
rear
probably
a
bit
to
pedestrian
for
some
but
a
drinkable
beer
appearance
is
the
only
negative
for
me
recommended
beautiful
copperygold
in
hue
with
strong
tawnybronze
influences
i
love
the
color
depth
sadly
there
wasnt
much
animation
the
lack
of
head
was
even
sadder
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
a
sliver
of
a
finger
and
then
it
faded
rapidly
to
a
very
scrawny
collar
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
either
what
a
waste
of
such
lovely
liquid
all
things
head
related
on
this
beer
were
subpar
the
nose
doesnt
say
much
my
first
whiff
said
bananas
what
i
couldnt
find
that
aroma
again
but
dammit
that
is
what
i
smelled
i
found
lots
of
nondescript
fruitiness
sweet
notes
from
the
malt
but
there
isnt
any
articulation
the
label
says
brewed
with
spruce
tips

how
big
were
these
alleged
tips
i
cant
smell
them
i
got
hints
of
alcohol
not
much
from
the
hops
some
slight
floral
earthiness
i
mean
slight
the
nose
is
disappointing
yawn
the
palate
doesnt
say
winter
seasonal

the
palate
seems
styleless
i
guess
this
is
a
ubiquitous
winter
warmer
it
is
sweet
but
not
rich
in
taste
at
first
there
are
hints
of
apple
cider
is
this
beer
spiced
is
it
just
hops
i
taste
i
get
some
weak
spicy
notes
i
cant
really
place
them
ginger
the
malt
is
odd
too
lightly
toasty
some
alcohol
heat
is
noticeable
light
woody
notes
at
the
back
the
palate
is
close
to
being
good
maybe
it
is
good
right
now
and
it
is
close
to
being
great
honestly
the
taste
profile
is
okay
it
doesnt
wow
me
at
all
if
i
saw
a
sixpack
in
a
store
id
skip
it
it
is
better
than
average
but
its
nothing
noteworthy
there
is
nothing
big
about
it
there
is
no
malty
goodness
no
hoppiness
and
no
array
of
spices
nothing
special
here
medium
in
body
with
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
tolerable
there
is
a
tacky
aftertaste
that
i
dont
like
that
makes
me
think
there
should
be
more
effervesces
easy
to
drink
but
pointless
to
do
so
i
am
very
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
it
is
forgettable
i
purchased
a
12ounce
bottle
online
from
liquid
solutions
other
comments
an
absolutely
scrumptious
winter
seasonal
the
spruce
is
very
subtle
not
overpowering
strangely
you
can
really
tastesmell
it
if
you
clear
your
throat
after
swallowing
a
gulp
of
it
sort
of
a
bouquet
of
spruce
not
too
bad
at
all
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
but
not
a
bad
choice
either
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
also
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
with
a
fruity
yeast
finish
i
cant
smell
the
spruce
tips
that
are
supposed
to
be
in
here
the
taste
is
awesome
it
has
a
very
refreshing
crystal
malt
flavor
with
a
kick
ass
spruce
aftertaste
it
goes
down
really
smooth
this
is
a
very
unusual
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
has
awesome
flavor
a
good
drinker
overall
a
nice
softspoken
winter
beer
subdued
caramel
sweetness
low
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
spruce
all
in
excellent
balance
the
subtlety
of
the
flavor
and
the
medium
body
belie
the
moderately
high
alcohol
making
this
an
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
winter
warmer
worth
picking
up
bads
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
could
be
stronger
aftertaste
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
drinkability
very
different
taste
as
i
am
finding
out
from
trying
different
winter
warmers
no
two
taste
the
same
they
all
have
their
different
tastes
i
havent
had
a
real
bad
on
yet
but
havent
had
one
that
i
absolutely
love
yet
either
worth
a
try
each
winter
overall
a
beer
that
i
definitely
look
forward
to
every
year
until
they
stop
crafting
it
or
the
taste
no
longer
impresses
my
taste
buds
a
question
should
an
alaskan
winter
ale
really
be
considered
a
seasonal
isnt
it
always
winter
there
beer
pours
an
orange
color
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
glass
large
carbonation
bubbles
noticed
smell
is
of
fruitty
yeasty
esters
carmally
sweetness
and
then
a
citrusy
piney
aroma
is
either
from
the
hops
or
spruce
taste
is
malty
sweet
medium
thick
bodied
balanced
with
hops
there
is
a
citrusy
taste
here
from
the
spruce
boughs
but
it
isnt
overpowering
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
have
too
many
of
these
because
that
spruce
might
be
a
little
to
acidic
over
the
course
of
a
night
i
love
the
unique
malt
flavor
of
this
beer
kicked
up
the
spruce
tips
or
whatever
spicy
and
full
and
bright
festive
the
taste
has
a
definite
slight
bitterness
and
astringency
that
does
not
seem
to
be
derived
from
the
use
of
hops
so
it
must
be
the
spruce
the
beer
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
a
light
refreshing
citrus
character
this
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
to
the
palate
though
there
is
some
solid
flavor
here
including
some
spiciness
this
is
a
very
good
winter
ale
by
alaskan
brewing
pours
a
dark
copperorange
with
a
slight
tan
but
more
white
froth
head
lacing
is
decent
but
not
great
smell
is
of
cinnamon
spice
and
nutmeg
slight
pine
tone
but
very
clean
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
light
for
a
winter
beer
nutmeg
sweetness
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
perfectly
blended
citrus
and
honey
aftertones
very
light
in
the
mouth
for
a
winter
ale
because
of
the
lightness
of
this
winter
ale
you
can
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
dangerous
because
the
alcohol
is
6
4
excellent
winter
brew
id
even
save
some
for
summer
as
well
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
malty
piney
and
slightly
medicinal
with
some
citrus
the
medium
body
has
some
creamy
malt
that
is
sweet
and
coating
it
is
a
little
fruity
with
some
pinespruce
notes
the
carbonation
is
a
little
high
as
well
a
clear
copper
beer
with
a
weak
offwhite
head
light
caramel
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
spices
come
through
a
bit
better
in
the
flavor
though
im
not
sure
i
detect
spruce
tips
sweet
biscuity
caramel
malt
a
light
fruitiness
and
a
moderately
bitter
finish
though
something
in
the
finish
just
strikes
me
as
a
bit
harsh
and
unpleasant
fairly
crisp
feeling
helped
by
a
decent
carbonation
better
cold
this
beer
relies
on
the
subtle
interplay
with
the
spruce
esters
coupled
with
a
medium
body
it
took
a
few
sips
to
see
how
nice
this
beer
works
as
a
winter
beer
it
was
fresh
tasting
yet
suggested
complexity
and
body
like
most
of
their
beers
a
sense
of
brewing
skill
is
demonstrated
with
the
execution
and
the
originality
of
the
style
i
have
to
admit
that
from
the
bottle
it
isnt
as
good
as
what
i
had
on
tap
at
the
2003
winter
ale
festival
but
its
definitely
a
close
relative
its
an
intriguing
flavor
easy
to
drink
yet
not
boring
and
i
look
forward
to
its
return
next
year
lightly
hazed
copper
hue
thin
uniform
ivory
white
head
yields
sparse
lace
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
mellow
mildly
buttery
toffee
offset
by
a
curiously
fruity
underripe
fig
twang
slight
sweet
wood
and
lemon
rind
like
hop
nose
fruity
tartness
continues
seamlessly
in
flavor
and
is
of
an
odd
but
agreeable
tamarind
like
nature
simple
and
stately
buttery
biscuit
and
medium
caramel
malt
backbone
understated
hop
bitterness
leaves
ample
residual
sweetness
that
precludes
easy
quaffing
orange
flesh
hop
flavor
with
a
floral
non
descript
continental
twang
thins
considerably
in
flavor
and
body
mid
palate
leaving
a
vacuous
airy
diluted
molasses
presence
comes
full
circle
late
with
a
resurgence
of
figgish
tartness
offset
by
a
golden
raisin
like
sweetness
aftertaste
of
buttered
warm
white
cracker
and
marmalade
an
eccentric
and
enjoyable
brew
malt
and
ester
character
seemed
to
compete
with
each
other
but
i
liked
that
with
a
fuller
body
this
could
be
outstanding
maybe
edit
2004
it
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
piney
taste
this
year
for
the
better
this
is
an
impressive
winterstyle
brew
appearance
crystal
clear
copper
amber
tone
with
a
whimpy
somewhat
thin
head
leaves
nice
speckled
lacing
spread
evenly
aroma
spruce
tips
and
hop
dosage
are
evident
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
this
is
one
nice
seasonal
scent
taste
surpasses
the
aroma
ties
it
altogether
candilike
sweetness
with
the
blend
of
finishing
hops
and
spruce
tips
harmonizing
together
excellent
beer
for
the
holiday
season
mouthfeel
medium
body
slightly
sticky
texture
to
it
nice
full
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
excellent
i
am
craving
more
and
more
of
this
flavor
it
just
works
so
well
i
cant
help
myself
this
is
an
excellent
winter
seasonal
bravo
to
the
ol
alaskan
brewing
co
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
id
look
to
have
again
anytime
soon
comments

i
hate
to
be
the
lowball
here
but
i
thought
this
was
an
inferior
effort
at
the
style
if
you
want
to
make
a
malty
pale
ale
just
call
it
a
malty
pale
ale
source
liquid
solutions
an
amber
ale
with
small
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malts
apple
pie
and
minty
evergreen
from
spruce
tips
the
malts
are
big
rich
satisfying
and
incredibly
sweet
without
being
too
cloying
i
am
wary
of
spiced
winter
brews
and
unusual
ingredients
such
as
spruce
tips
but
the
evergreen
quality
actually
works
with
the
beer
quite
well
the
hops
create
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
the
mouth
puckers
at
the
end
of
each
sip
but
the
beer
is
not
excessively
bitter
like
many
highly
hopped
beers
its
more
like
a
tartness
similar
to
apple
juice
or
white
grape
juice
a
very
satisfying
finish
to
a
very
satisfying
beer
again
a
solid
beer
to
be
sure
but
a
special
beer
not
really
its
good
but
i
was
expecting
more
i
think
this
is
a
above
average
winter
ale
the
color
was
a
dark
tan
with
very
little
head
and
no
lace
the
smell
of
spices
with
a
hint
of
a
certain
tree
smell
filled
the
nose
the
taste
of
spices
malts
and
a
hint
of
a
sprucepine
graced
my
palate
what
a
pleasant
taste
not
over
powering
with
a
well
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
this
is
my
first
beer
review
any
suggestions
please
drop
me
a
line
this
was
a
nice
find
at
the
white
horse
on
parsons
green
in
london
this
was
presented
to
me
with
a
nice
dark
peach
colour
and
a
nice
white
head
the
aromas
were
of
different
kinds
of
spices
yeast
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
spicy
fruity
and
a
bit
alcoholic
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
but
not
syrupy
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
good
and
different
winter
alequite
drinkable
good
spruce
ale
not
quite
as
good
as
siletz
spruce
ale
but
good
none
the
less
taste
is
sweet
mild
malt
profile
but
enough
of
the
stuff
to
give
it
a
fairly
round
body
delicate
tastes
from
the
tips
come
through
and
give
it
an
almost
wit
like
taste
mild
apple
tart
and
pucker
which
compliments
the
maltiness
well
it
poured
a
decent
copperorange
color
but
had
almost
no
head
at
all
plus
whatever
head
it
did
have
by
the
time
i
got
halfway
done
with
the
beer
it
was
completely
flat
the
smell
was
pretty
good
with
a
light
hoppiness
and
some
spicy
aromas
but
when
i
got
to
the
taste
there
was
very
little
spicinees
at
all
slightly
bitter
with
a
good
malty
base
everall
i
thought
it
was
an
ok
beer
but
was
definately
missing
a
couple
things
2002
version
pours
a
very
nice
copper
color
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
very
visibly
carbonated
which
kind
of
surprised
me
nose
is
greeted
by
a
very
pleasant
sweet
fruit
and
pine
in
the
aroma
flavor
was
of
a
very
sweet
overripe
pear
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
was
quite
piney
in
nature
nice
mediumfull
body
overall
a
definite
possibility
for
purchase
again
this
year
2000
edition

somewhat

spruce
not
really
noticeable
nice
flavor
anyway
finish

aftertaste
is
crisp

clean
nice
beer
good
rich
copper
color
with
a
good
sized

that
was
lightly
froathy
and
light
tan
in
color
good
aroma
of
sweet
hops
nice
and
fresh
smell
of
malt
as
well
taste
the
malt
right
away
then
sweetens
a
bit
and
covers
nicely
with
a
fresh
hop
finish
sort
of
warmed
as
it
went
down
good
medium
body
and
feel
i
did
enjoy
this
winter
ale
very
much
but
i
think
being
there
in
the
summer
dampened
the
real
spirit
of
what
this
brew
can
offer
when
its
cold
im
sure
it
would
probably
be
even
better
then
nice
transoucent
amber
color
sprucey
aroma
nice
balance
in
the
taste
i
think
that
alskan
brewing
should
make
this
a
year
round
beer
not
much
in
the
line
of
a
winter
ale
here
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
i
have
to
say
that
alaskan
winter
ale
is
a
rather
unusual
creature
in
relation
to
the
typical
roasty
and
rich
seasonal
ales
for
that
i
have
to
give
the
alaskan
brewing
co
a
big
thumbs
up
for
their
imaginative
efforts
its
a
welcomed
departure
notes
a
solid
yet
serene
winter
seasonal
the
spicing
of
the
hops
and
spruce
are
balanced
at
most
this
holds
the
beer
character
to
a
sturdy
strong
or
old
ale
fashion
when
i
saw
the
use
of
spruce
tips
on
teh
label
i
was
expecting
varnish
gave
it
a
shot
and
loved
it
nice
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
a
nice
sweet
flavor
which
goes
down
extremely
smoothly
the
alcohol
content
doesnt
harsh
out
the
brew
at
all
cant
wait
for
next
years
pours
a
bit
syrupy
has
very
thin
white
head
that
goes
away
within
seconds
dont
get
a
lot
on
the
aroma
maybe
a
small
hint
of
spruce
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
and
amber
taste
is
unique
spruce
tips
are
used
in
this
recipe
and
are
evident
on
the
tongue
pretty
sweet
but
not
malty
sweet
taste
alcoholic
warmth
is
evident
to
a
minor
degree
a
good
holiday
brew
but
not
one
to
have
many
in
one
sitting
an
excellent
beer
but
dont
expect
a
thick
rich
brew
this
is
clean
crisp
maltysweet
ale
with
a
very
unique
flavor
due
to
the
spruce
tips
im
guessing
the
spruce
tips
do
not
overwhelm
but
blend
perfectly
into
this
beer
and
add
a
touch
you
dont
find
elsewhere
i
love
a
good
strong
old
ale
but
this
is
outstanding
in
its
own
way
light
golden
in
color
nice
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
spruce
a
respectable
seasonal
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
they
do
not
feel
compeled
to
do
a
storong
ale
or
some
spiced
up
brew
for
the
holiday
season
this
and
their
stout
are
there
two
best
brews
imho
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
the
aroma
is
almost
as
if
its
a
barrel
aged
beer
there
is
no
hint
of
hops
the
first
impression
of
its
taste
is
its
sweetness
almost
too
much
with
some
maltiness
and
slight
funk
and
hops
unlike
the
aroma
there
is
no
barrel
aged
character
in
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
full
body
and
light
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
likely
one
that
id
go
back
to
often
alright
aroma
but
the
flavor
just
wasnt
up
to
the
level
of
something
like
third
coast
old
ale
had
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
that
i
thought
didnt
mesh
well
with
the
malts

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
this
style
of
ale
it
pours
a
handsome
mahogany
color
with
an
overly
abundant
off
white
headand
i
do
mean
overly
abundant
it
leaves
a
silky
lacing
and
nice
legs
the
aroma
is
boozy
reminds
me
more
of
scotch
or
bourbon
than
beer
notes
of
wood
and
vanilla
and
peat
abound
the
mouth
is
sticky
and
very
coating
one
of
the
thicker
beers
ive
tried
the
flavor
is
complex
embodying
many
of
the
notes
of
a
well
made
whiskey
it
is
very
sweet
at
first
but
gives
way
to
a
pleasant
depth
of
flavor
that
is
warming
for
the
body
mouth
and
soul
very
nice
beer
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
the
style
i
thought
i
had
purchased
a
more
recent
vintage
but
was
quite
happy
to
find
out
that
my
bottle
was
4
years
old
i
wish
i
could
find
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
where
this
beer
started
at
this
age
it
has
an
unexpected
apple
flavor
which
i
assume
is
acetaldehyde
it
works
for
this
beer
the
real
letdown
about
this
beer
is
that
the
body
is
too
thin
to
carry
the
flavors
nice
complexity
and
the
molasses
caramel
and
dark
fruit
all
work
really
well
together
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
body
and
booziness
to
carry
this
through
still
worth
trying
though
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
boulevards
sixth
glass
quad
ale
so
i
would
probably
call
it
a
quad
ale
a
good
brew
although
i
am
a
little
biased
because
that
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
would
definitely
buy
again
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
try
it
if
you
love
old
ales
snatch
some
up
for
the
cellar
if
they
are
a
good
price
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
all
that
said
this
is
the
2009
vintage
so
this
beer
is
almost
4
years
old
i
imagine
the
carbonation
being
low
has
something
to
do
with
that
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
one
a
little
younger
because
i
feel
certain
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
and
would
be
better
in
a
later
vintage
if
youre
a
fan
of
old
ales
give
it
a
shot
but
its
something
id
probably
only
grab
again
if
i
saw
it
in
single
bottle
overall
it
was
interesting
to
try
such
an
old
style
of
ale
its
definitely
not
something
i
would
ever
drink
on
for
pleasure
only
because
of
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
but
i
can
tell
this
beer
was
made
right
the
other
flavors
go
together
nicely
overall
this
is
a
strong
alethe
9
0
abv
seems
a
bit
low
for
how
strong
a
taste
the
alcohol
leavesive
had
other
brews
with
similar
or
higher
abv
but
with
way
more
resonating
flavorthis
beer
seems
a
bit
one
sided
with
little
to
no
balanceits
good
but
i
dont
think
id
search
this
one
out
again
25
o
a
pretty
standard
old
ale
nothing
special
but
nothing
offensive
a
bit
of
odd
bitterness
that
doesnt
really
fit
not
bad
middle
of
the
road
o
this
is
a
very
simple
straightforward
old
ale
in
fact
it
is
the
simplicity
that
makes
this
beer
so
appealing
it
is
sweet
without
becoming
cloying
and
the
sweetness
compliments
the
grains
well
this
beer
is
a
very
good
baseline
for
thinking
about
old
ales
it
is
also
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
so
be
careful
because
it
is
9
abv
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
and
pleasing
beer
for
fans
of
old
ale
if
you
see
it
buy
it
you
will
be
happy
you
did
o
factoring
in
the
price
on
this
one
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
at
just
under
4
bucks
a
bottle
its
a
nice
beer
if
your
a
fan
of
old
ales
if
not
i
would
pass
on
this
one
cheers
overall
well
it
has
some
off
flavors
but
they
dont
make
me
cringe
just
wish
they
werent
there
medicinal
flavor
and
a
very
stale
bitter
finish
taste
follows
closely
most
of
the
experience
is
in
the
full
smooth
mouthfeel
which
carries
subdued
and
wellbalanced
dried
fruit
candy
notes
detectable
alcohol
which
i
am
just
fine
with
in
my
barleywines
and
old
ales
a
beast
very
rich
i
would
recommend
this
for
fans
of
the
style
and
if
you
want
a
really
big
interesting
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
is
not
for
everyday
it
is
special
o
quite
a
unique
and
well
balanced
ale
certainly
worth
a
try
fragrant
and
flavorful
overall
a
good
beer
more
aromatic
would
be
nice
and
nothing
really
sticks
out
as
special
but
would
recommend
for
drinking
2009
vintage
this
dude
seems
way
too
cocky
for
my
liking
the
beer
though
looks
lovely
bedecked
in
rosy
garnet
and
topped
by
a
steadfast
finger
of
oatmealtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
maple
syrup
toffee
mandarin
orange
syrup
dark
leafy
greens
a
tiny
sprig
of
mint
and
a
vein
of
cocoa
in
the
background
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toffee
mandarin
orange
syrup
light
tobacco
cocoa
graham
cracker
vanilla
bean
brown
sugar
belgian
candi
sugar
and
that
same
sprig
of
mint
very
mild
and
very
subtle
lodged
way
in
the
distance
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
feel
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
yet
had
fom
arcadia
this
one
wins
on
a
number
of
levels
it
falls
just
short
of
being
truly
special
but
it
is
pretty
damn
good
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
bellow
average
old
ale
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
so
i
am
no
where
near
an
expert
on
old
ales
i
just
thought
that
flavor
and
body
seemed
watered
down
and
the
nice
and
intense
aroma
didnt
make
its
way
over
to
the
flavor
which
was
disappointing
this
beer
doesnt
have
good
drinkability
its
a
little
boozy
which
doesnt
work
well
when
the
beer
feels
watered
down
and
the
flavors
just
dont
hold
my
attention
one
is
more
then
enough
for
me
you
wont
catch
me
reaching
for
another
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
this
beer
looked
damn
good
and
had
a
really
nice
head
for
an
old
ale
the
aroma
wasnt
too
bad
either
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
was
light
and
watery
with
the
flavors
no
really
doing
it
for
me
and
the
mouthfeel
was
also
watery
and
much
lighter
then
it
should
be
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
and
it
was
pretty
expensive
for
what
it
was
at
3
79
a
bottle
there
are
much
better
beers
to
be
found
for
that
price
i
cant
say
that
i
recommend
this
beer
if
you
really
like
old
ales
it
may
be
worth
the
try
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
run
of
the
mill
i
have
never
had
this
beer
fresh
so
i
dont
know
how
the
age
has
effected
this
beer
but
if
the
flavors
were
as
intense
as
the
aroma
it
probably
wouldnt
be
that
bad
but
the
flavors
were
much
lighter
letting
some
of
the
harsh
off
flavors
show
up
more
then
they
should
i
just
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
i
would
much
rather
have
a
founders
curmudgeon
and
that
beer
is
stronger
and
better
priced
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
old
ale
and
one
of
my
least
favorite
brews
arcadia
they
can
make
some
damn
good
beer
too
bad
that
this
wasnt
one
of
them
o
this
is
over
a
year
old
version
of
this
beer
yet
i
am
still
inundated
with
the
aroma
and
taste
of
alcohol
im
wondering
if
older
versions
mellow
it
out
on
the
senses
im
not
saying
the
alcohol
is
bad
it
is
a
little
too
central
in
the
characteristics
also
the
picture
needs
to
be
updated
they
have
a
different
label
now
o
a
wonderful
winter
nightcap
a
nice
sipper
that
gives
the
impression
of
a
warming
effect
would
be
interested
to
see
if
the
2011
version
is
actually
the
current
release
the
bottle
shop
where
i
puchased
this
was
in
existence
in
2010
a
little
odd
eh
arcadia
big
dicks
olde
ale
is
not
as
complex
or
as
rich
as
my
favorite
old
ale
north
coast
old
stock
ale
big
dicks
olde
ale
is
good
and
a
very
drinkable
old
ale
nevertheless
overall
worth
picking
up
as
the
prices
was
only
2single
which
isnt
too
shabby
for
the
style
typically
i
would
say
to
just
pop
for
the
13
four
pack
of
olde
stock
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
and
dont
feel
like
dropping
the
coin
this
one
will
do
better
head
retention
aroma
is
about
the
same
taste
has
lost
the
boozy
flavor
still
a
bit
buttery
overall
the
previous
rough
edges
seem
to
have
smoothed
out
the
alcohol
is
now
hidden
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
a
very
thick
and
creamy
offwhite
head
really
nice
lacing
and
a
good
cap
throughout
the
nose
brings
forward
some
light
toffee
and
brown
sugar
nothing
too
complex
sweet
malt
throughout
really
quite
plain
and
not
all
that
integrated
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
and
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
throughout
decent
enough
but
not
something
that
i
would
come
back
to
o
this
beer
just
seems
out
of
whack
for
me
its
a
bunch
of
different
flavors
that
dont
come
together
to
form
one
cohesive
brew
pass
not
a
bad
beer
overall
not
the
best
i
have
had
of
this
style
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
average
across
the
board
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
light
hazy
red
color
the
head
raised
about
an
inch
or
so
until
it
faded
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
spicy
boozy
and
had
some
sweet
malts
in
there
too
the
taste
had
some
dark
fruits
upfront
that
transformed
into
a
smooth
earthy
spice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
pretty
drinkable
overall
i
would
drink
this
one
again
aroma
is
fruity
and
tangy
apple
and
orange
with
an
undertone
of
barleywine
it
pours
a
dark
cinnamon
brown
with
a
fluffy
pale
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
flavor
is
quite
fruity
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
and
a
slightly
sweet
malty
undertone
texture
is
smooth
and
short
on
fizz
but
i
had
this
bottle
squirreled
away
for
a
while
before
discovering
it
a
tasty
and
pleasing
ale
poured
a
2
light
caramel
colored
head
held
to
the
light
the
body
is
an
interesting
hazy
reddish
caramel
malt
dominates
the
nose
the
flavor
again
has
lots
of
malt
a
little
saltiness
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
both
barleywine
and
scotch
ale
styles
the
body
is
medium
weight
and
theres
a
medium
finish
all
in
all
bid
dick
made
a
quality
product
serving
type
bottle
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
good
deal
due
to
its
unique
finish
and
delicious
taste
its
not
perfect
but
its
pretty
good
in
fact
that
sums
up
most
of
my
feelings
on
arcadias
beers
to
date
interesting
beer
glad
i
purchased
but
this
is
likely
a
one
time
drink
for
me
d
i
am
not
sure
that
i
will
finish
this
based
on
the
fact
that
the
floaties
are
way
at
the
bottom
of
this
bomber
fellow
ba
bamadog
always
says
the
floaties
are
protein
but
im
going
to
pass
interesting
to
have
an
8
beer
5
years
aged
not
bad
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
its
a
little
over
the
cliff
in
terms
of
best
flavor
flavorful
and
interesting
dark
fruit
sweetness
is
matched
well
with
a
dry
cedar
perfume
quality
overall
is
drinkable
but
very
boring
for
an
old
ale
lacking
the
full
flavor
and
complexities
i
would
expect
from
this
style
not
an
old
but
slightly
above
average
very
drinkable
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
black
dog
urbana
il
future
outlook
nice
beer
that
isnt
available
around
here
happy
to
have
tried
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
the
beer
pours
an
undistinguished
cloudy
brown
with
a
slight
head
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
as
it
warms
you
notice
the
alcohol
more
which
our
bottle
lists
as
9
overall
i
would
get
this
beer
again
while
not
the
best
olde
ale
but
definitely
better
than
average
pour
from
a
bottle
a
hazy
red
with
some
spotty
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
non
distinct
fruit
some
apple
and
some
sort
of
spicy
hops
the
flavor
has
some
good
caramel
maltiness
and
a
pleasant
graininess
the
beer
is
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
id
put
the
alcohol
here
at
78
based
on
the
body
but
theres
no
alcohol
flavor
here
not
much
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
its
pretty
smooth
and
the
body
is
thinner
than
some
of
the
vintage
type
ales
overall
the
mouth
and
the
drinkability
are
above
average
poured
a
chug
of
this
into
a
snifter
its
about
a
40
oz
snifter
2009
vintage
poured
dec
1st
2010
dark
amber
nose
is
pretty
malty
taste
is
not
quite
as
malty
with
a
good
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
too
prevalent
for
8
abv
not
quite
balanced
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
serve
it
to
any
friends
with
developed
beer
palates
but
at
the
same
time
probably
not
one
ill
reach
for
on
the
shelf
anytime
soon
i
could
keep
going
but
all
you
need
to
know
is
get
a
differant
bottle
very
enjoyable
i
wish
there
was
some
more
body
but
overall
a
great
old
ale
with
a
lot
of
character
something
that
i
would
highly
recommend
drinkability
while
admittedly
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
dick
joke
name
this
beer
is
a
pretty
fine
sipper
not
sure
if
it
makes
it
into
ohio
but
i
could
see
a
few
of
these
going
in
the
cellar
taste
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
arcadias
beers
but
this
is
nice
sweet
cherries
a
bit
of
alcohol
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
overly
sweet
and
it
is
sweet
but
not
inappropriately
so
real
quality
stuff
in
my
opinion
solid
beer
but
not
excellent
much
better
suited
to
be
served
on
cask
with
cocoa
nibs
easy
to
drink
though
not
going
to
repeat
too
often
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
might
be
better
similar
beers
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
my
advice
would
be
to
cellar
this
one
for
a
few
years
if
youre
skeptical
about
it
d
it
was
a
bit
tough
to
finish
with
the
soapy
yeasty
quality
getting
stronger
and
the
lemony
quality
to
the
hops
just
dont
work
together
there
wasnt
much
malt
flavor
so
perhaps
age
would
bring
some
of
that
out
d
not
impressed
at
all
the
beer
did
get
drank
but
only
after
a
couple
of
my
buddies
helped
me
out
with
it
maybe
i
had
some
of
this
and
it
wasnt
suppose
to
be
served
ill
try
again
just
to
be
sure
into
a
tulip
poured
a
dark
murky
amberburgundy
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
did
not
retain
well
but
lacing
was
decent
the
aroma
had
hints
of
plum
raisin
rum
vanilla
caramel
toffee
and
it
seemed
like
every
time
i
stuck
my
beak
in
there
i
came
away
with
a
new
aroma
very
impressive
in
the
taste
i
did
get
a
sense
that
there
was
a
high
alcohol
content
but
i
also
got
the
sense
that
it
had
relented
over
time
and
it
blended
very
nicely
with
a
rumraisin
vanilla
caramel
plum
and
even
modest
pineapple
bouquet
slight
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
but
this
is
also
where
the
citrus
appears
slick
and
smooth
thick
with
zero
carbonation
definitely
a
sipping
beer
with
a
creamy
dessert
or
a
cigar
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
man
did
this
one
age
well
needless
to
say
we
went
back
to
the
store
the
next
day
to
see
if
they
had
more
but
no
luck
d
a
well
made
old
ale
overall
but
nothing
spectacular
a
very
dark
amber
burgundy
tone
with
a
huge
of
white
fuzz
head
slowly
popping
down
a
little
layer
of
sediment
stirs
at
the
bottom
but
is
easily
picked
up
and
pours
the
transparency
to
nearly
opaque
smells
like
alcohol
and
ripened
fruits
taste
is
much
the
same
a
fruity
malt
taste
pleasant
to
the
palate
lighter
than
i
imagined
it
to
be
cheers
overall
i
think
2
years
in
the
cellar
did
wonders
for
this
beer
much
better
than
i
expected
overall
i
like
this
beer
more
in
toto
than
the
summary
above
would
indicate
i
would
generally
consider
an
old
ale
thats
this
sweet
to
be
at
least
moderately
flawed
but
in
this
beer
it
somehow
works
with
the
dryness
to
give
what
is
to
my
palate
a
very
pleasing
overall
experience
do
i
contradict
myself
very
well
i
contradict
myself
i
contain
multitudes
d
just
not
a
fan
of
this
one
i
was
warned
but
i
bought
it
anyway
oh
well
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
one
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hops
and
citrus
lemon
fits
the
style
of
an
american
strong
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
the
feel
is
also
slightly
watery
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
hops
slight
roasted
malt
and
citrus
apple
overall
good
aroma
and
appearance
but
lacking
in
mouth
feel
and
body
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
caramel
malt
scent
with
hints
of
smoke
and
alcohol
warmth
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
character
with
plenty
of
caramel
flavor
and
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
there
is
a
burnt
flavor
as
well
that
gives
off
a
slightly
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
old
ale
im
not
crazy
on
burnt
character
its
a
little
off
putting
d
a
decent
strong
ale
that
might
seem
to
need
more
time
in
the
bottle
to
let
it
develop
more
shows
promise
though
d
this
is
definitely
the
best
arcadia
beer
i
have
had
so
far
been
disappointed
with
them
but
this
is
pretty
good
and
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
definitely
try
it
sometime
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
olde
ale
it
seemed
like
it
needed
some
age
on
it
so
that
the
flavors
would
settle
d
really
interesting
ale
a
nice
sipping
beer
that
isnt
to
heavy
or
overpowering
in
intensity
this
has
ok
drinkability
pretty
good
for
an
old
ale
but
average
compared
to
the
whole
beer
spectrum
this
wasnt
a
particularly
good
or
enjoyable
beer
pretty
mediocre
notes
complex
malt
character
warming
alcohol
and
rich
body
make
for
a
delicious
winter
warmer
good
example
of
a
textbook
english
old
ale
this
has
mellowed
tremendously
as
the
light
toffee
maltiness
is
complimented
by
some
fruity
esters
and
slight
booziness
there
are
some
mild
signs
of
oxidation
in
the
flavor
but
not
much
i
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
creaminess
and
the
malts
seem
a
bit
light
and
not
sweet
enough
hops
have
all
but
disappeared
by
now
but
it
sure
could
use
some
leafy
green
bitterness
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
a
lackluster
old
ale
at
the
3
year
mark
conclusion
id
had
this
beer
once
before
and
thought
i
really
liked
it
but
in
retrospect
it
was
before
i
really
started
getting
into
craft
and
i
might
have
had
a
couple
of
brews
before
this
one
so
my
judgment
may
not
have
been
spot
on
arcadias
brews
are
very
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
ones
a
bit
of
a
letdown
this
is
very
much
my
style
offering
loads
of
sweetness
and
just
hints
of
bitterness
a
pretty
decent
beer
on
the
whole
and
one
that
certainly
develops
as
it
warms
but
not
my
favorite
style
and
certainly
not
my
favorite
within
the
style
i
found
this
beer
to
be
undrinkable
i
would
not
purchase
it
again
d
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
for
me
the
strong
alcohol
and
oaked
flavors
pummel
the
palate
but
this
is
to
be
desired
by
many
my
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
low
retention
the
color
was
a
very
cloudy
orangishbrown
nose
was
rich
with
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
good
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
let
it
warm
and
i
was
glad
that
i
did
some
of
the
sweetness
diminished
allowing
a
warming
sensation
to
come
forward
the
finish
was
warm
leaving
me
with
a
glowing
feel
one
would
be
plenty
for
this
hophead
overall
i
am
really
liking
this
beer
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
here
seems
to
be
aged
in
barrels
but
i
am
not
certain
on
that
definitely
wished
i
had
grabbed
another
bomber
at
the
price
i
got
it
at
i
could
definitely
have
this
again
this
brew
is
drinkable
but
only
for
a
few
it
is
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
and
the
alcohol
is
to
apparent
in
this
one
drinks
alright
but
lack
of
malt
depth
really
takes
this
one
down
a
knotch
or
2
not
bad
just
doesny
quite
pull
together
reviewing
to
style
this
one
doesnt
do
so
well
this
beer
pours
a
an
interesting
shade
of
light
translucent
yet
hazy
mahogany
there
is
a
decent
finger
and
a
half
tan
head
to
it
that
has
good
retention
though
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
light
but
sweet
some
caramel
malts
come
through
raisins
cherries
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
taste
is
bitter
up
front
some
roasted
malts
that
werent
in
the
nose
it
then
sweetens
up
with
caramel
malts
and
raisin
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
hop
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
a
bit
oilyslick
going
down
decent
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
content
is
evident
overall
a
decent
beer
not
my
particular
favorite
of
the
style
but
worth
sitting
down
with
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
into
my
shaker
glass
the
bottle
states
this
is
a
2006
vintage
appears
a
muted
hazy
dark
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
off
white
head
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
it
is
not
overpowering
time
was
kind
to
this
bottle
it
mellowed
nicely
smells
of
brown
sugar
bananas
and
caramel
malt
bananas
foster
in
a
bottle
anyone
tastes
is
dominated
by
over
ripe
brown
mushy
bananas
caramel
and
brown
sugar
medium
bodied
with
slightly
muted
carbonation
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
with
some
age
on
it

all
in

pretty

really
nothing

pretty

just

is

nothing

nothing

overall
just

just
right
as
in
goldie

and
the
three
bears
this
is
one
that
ill
consider
buying
again
i
am
pleased
with
this
beer
from
arcadia
its
the
first
ive
had
in
a
long
time
due
to
some
volcanoes
that
i
previously
had
this
beer
is
the
first
from
them
that
has
impressed
me
the
first
that
im
thinking
about
coming
back
to
at
some
point
i
will
enjoy
drinking
the
rest
of
this
beer
d
drinks
well
goes
down
easy
isnt
overly
filling
will
get
you
drunk
quick
not
bad
at
all
medium
pour
bigs
out
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
long
and
a
spotty
lace
that
sinks
right
back
into
this
murky
copper
colored
brew
the
aroma
is
faint
but
what
i
detect
is
cherries
a
splash
of
rum
and
raisins
theres
a
bit
more
action
in
the
taste
compared
to
the
smell
but
not
quite
what
one
would
expect
from
something
that
claims
on
the
label
to
be
a
liquid
ode
to
richard
the
lion
heart
yknow
what
i
mean
such
grand
statements
prepare
ya
for
something
brimming
with
attitude
in
its
flavors
but
it
almost
seems
that
this
is
more
talk
than
it
is
action
its
not
bad
though
it
just
doesnt
push
it
to
some
hearty
full
on
floor
ya
type
of
flavorful
level
medium
bodiednot
too
thick
and
not
too
light
lots
of
malt
sweetness
and
some
dark
fruit
flavors
on
the
tongue
brown
sugar
notes
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
a
bit
of
a
brandy
burn
down
the
throat
overall
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
again
in
the
near
future
tough
style
and
kudos
on
the
effort
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
arcadia
d
this
beer
would
get
pretty
heavy
pretty
nice
though
and
i
love
the
style
not
enough
old
ales
out
there
nice
head
with
a
clean
finish
in
the
mouth
a
little
tart
to
begin
with
but
finishes
well
for
only
eight
percent
the
alcohol
taste
is
rather
prevalent
reddish
amber
in
color
with
what
tastes
like
hints
of
cherry
in
the
body
taste
really
develops
as
it
gets
a
tad
bit
warmer
cocoa
brown
with
some
white
head
this
is
an
easy
drinking
british
style
old
ale
that
style
has
usually
demonstrated
more
barley
taste
to
me
more
caramel
and
rum
from
brown
sugar
there
is
some
cocoa
in
here
and
a
nice
finish
a
good
one
to
share
drinkability
ehh
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
isnt
nearly
the
blast
to
the
palate
that
some
old
ales
are
but
i
dont
think
that
they
have
to
be
like
that
this
is
labeled
as
a
american
strong
ale
on
this
site
whatever
that
is
either
way
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
that
you
give
one
a
shot
especially
if
you
like
a
malty
to
balanced
beer
with
mild
hops
heres
to
you
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
mediumheavy
bodied
raisin
nose
flavor
is
sweet
fruity
and
a
little
medicinal
the
bitterness
balances
6
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
yankee
spirits
south
attleboro
ma
really
sweet
to
be
especially
drinkable
the
first
few
sips
are
interesting
but
i
struggles
through
this
bomber
drinkability
is
not
to
hot
because
this
beer
is
and
overly
sweet
the
taste
is
initially
pretty
good
but
after
a
few
sips
you
quickly
realize
your
in
for
a
long
hard
slog
if
you
try
to
finish
the
bomber
i
didnt
d
not
so
great
glad
i
split
the
bomber
with
a
friend
to
be
honest
not
one
ill
likely
revisit
heavy
with
good
feel
drinkable
with
a
nice
dessert
or
cigar
one
to
find
for
sure
not
sure
what
the
problem
was
with
previous
vintages
but
this
one
is
very
nice
im
not
quite
sure
what
they
were
going
for
with
big
dicks
but
i
doubt
it
came
together
as
they
intended
granted
old
ale
is
a
style
that
has
tripped
up
many
a
great
craft
brewers
so
theres
no
shame
in
trying
but
arcadia
is
going
to
have
to
try
a
lot
harder
to
refine
future
batches

olde
ale
is
a
strange
brew
id
love
to
know
whether
the
brewers
at
arcadia
meant
for
it
to
taste
like
this
or
if
something
unforeseen
happened
along
the
way
and
ruined
what
was
intended
can
i
have
my
6
79
back
overall
its
drinkable
well
sippable
enough
despite
shortcomings
and
noticeable
alcohol
tinge
which
is
fine
here
i
dont
know
that
i
liked
it
quite
as
much
as
the
overall
score
reflects
but
i
ended
up
enjoying
it
enough
to
let
it
go
at
that
d
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
i
was
expecting
a
much
heavier
offering
considering
its
an
old
ale
but
this
is
rather
sweet
and
lighter
on
the
palate
definitely
unique
i
will
come
back
to
this
again
in
the
future
had
i
know
what
to
expect
i
might
have
paired
this
with
a

2006
vintage
this
poured
a
dark
hazy
brown
with
orange
accents
and
tan
head
it
smelled
like
a
blend
of
delicious
malts
including
caramel
barley
and
rye
as
well
as
mild
orange
and
copper
hops
it
had
a
very
complex
and
well
balanced
flavor
tasting
first
like
sweet
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
malts
then
like
bitter
floral
hops
then
like
earthy
and
leathery
malts
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
and
sweet
aftertaste
and
it
had
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
fine
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
delicious
d
fairly
average
per
style
worth
a
try
maybe
not
a
sixpack
im
not
one
for
astringent
offerings
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
for
me
deep
leather
and
mahagony
color
with
some
light
bubbling
and
a
light
head
just
a
great
color
though
very
nice
when
swirling
in
a
snifter
the
aroma
is
full
of
syrupy
caramelized
fruits
the
taste
starts
with
dark
figs
with
a
little
leather
then
some
roasted
apples
in
with
a
very
light
cinnamon
syrup
ith
a
sweet
yet
slightly
herbal
finish
very
warm
beer
but
very
tingly
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
great
sipping
beer
glad
this
beer
is
finally
available
in
illinois
there
was
a
solid
pop
when
the
bottle
was
uncapped
and
there
was
an
immediate
smell
of
cinnamon
the
beer
was
fairly
clear
a
deep
amber
colour
with
reddish
highlights
the
thin
ring
and
skim
of
fine
bubbles
showed
decent
retention
and
produced
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
sort
of
odd
a
combination
of
cinnamon
mint
and
melon
with
a
tart
funkiness
moderate
bitterness
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
but
it
seems
really
thin
on
malt
sour
cherry
notes
and
a
bit
of
weird
funk
were
evident
as
was
a
bit
of
wood
character
and
lingering
minty
hops
the
body
and
carbonation
were
alright
though
it
seemed
a
little
light
and
there
was
a
bit
of
warmth
this
was
definitely
a
strange
beast
one
that
i
probably
wouldnt
try
again
appearance
is

clouded

thick
with

forming
scantily
as
the
head
slowly
dwindles
much
better
than
i
recall
fresh
this
is
from
last
years
batch
aromatics
are
tart
raisin
and
fig
and
earthy
notes
of
grape
seed
sweet
and
tart
play
well
togethr
in
the
malt
component
mild
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
lets
face
it
an
old
ale
brings
the
malt
flavors
flow
with
malt
and
fruit
tartness
namingly
an
array
of
raisin
apple
juice
and
mild
citrus
appeal
finish
brings
out
a
mild
charred
oak
character
even
though
im
aware
this
one
hasnt
seen
the
barrel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
even
with
soft
carbonation
flow
nicely
one
smooth
quality
sipper
drinkability
is
okay
one
that
did
develop
less
brashness
after
a
year
flavors
didnt
meld
at
all
with
the
original
release
im
glad
my
buddy
kolbz
hit
up
bockown
for
it
the
flavor
is
malty
very
rich
firm
bitterness
enough
to
balance
the
malt
citrus
hint
of
spice
lingering
with
caramelized
malt
beer
is
good
happy
beering
d
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
that
was
an
unusual
aftertaste
otherwise
it
is
not
a
bad
brew
maybe
it
needs
more
aging
this
beer
poured
a
clear
red
amber
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
light
tan
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
cherry
lightly
of
caramel
but
largely
light
for
a
strong
ale
the
flavor
was
of
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
pepper
the
body
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
a
touch
sweet
as
strong
ales
go
this
one
is
a
bit
weak
it
may
need
aging
but
it
doesnt
show
that
raw
power
of
those
that
even
need
aging
this
beer
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
there
is
a
lot
of
potential
here
but
the
beer
hits
all
the
wrong
notes
it
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
bubbly
head
some
retention
no
lacing
the
smell
reminds
me
of
poor
quality
malt
liquors
with
that
sweet
yet
wet
cardboard
aroma
the
beer
is
a
medium
bodied
slightly
syrupy
sweet
ale
that
has
some
deep
fruits
to
it
such
as
raisin
rum
and
brown
sugar
but
it
is
not
warming
and
has
this
biting
hoppiness
that
isnt
all
that
good
so
with
this
beer
you
have
compromised
sweet
malts
and
very
imbalanced
hop
bitterness
with
an
aftertaste
that
is
just
too
rough
in
the
throat
look
elsewhere
2006
vintage
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
chesnut
brown
with
a
well
formed
one
finger
off
white
pillowey
head
that
left
broken
rings
of
lace
behind
as
it
settled
uninspiring
aromas
kinda
dull
actually
a
bit
of
orange
essence
as
well
as
some
brown
sugar
but
really
it
didnt
hit
homethat
orange
comes
through
flavor
wise
with
some
brown
sugara
fading
leather
note
and
a
touch
of
vanillaoak
no
hop
presence
really
shows
through
a
little
plain
it
has
its
strengths
but
in
the
ends
its
kinda
boring
i
always
worry
about
new
old
ales
the
contradiction
in
terms
usually
result
in
young
or
green
beer
that
shouldnt
be
on
the
market
for
up
to
a
year
after
brewing
this
beer
exhibits
some
of
these
young
traits
but
more
peculiar
is
a
harsh
woodaged
character
that
chases
the
beer
from
the
nose
to
the
finish
the
aromas
open
with
a
partial
sweet
partial
twangy
scent
of
deep
molassastype
malts
dark
dried
fruits
and
a
musty
sweaty
scent
that
is
reminescent
of
belgian
artisanal
ales
the
flavors
bring
up
the
malts
but
are
quickly
swamped
by
an
agressive
wood
character
with
high
amounts
of
berrylike
tartness
nuttiness
papery
woody
earthy
flavors
that
prove
to
be
too
distracting
for
the
old
ale
the
little
critters
that
live
in
the
wood
for
aging
have
made
theirselves
too
much
at
home
bringing
a
sharp
very
astringent
and
thin
texture
to
the
brew
making
it
tough
to
finish
although
the
astringent
flavors
and
textures
remind
me
of
labics
or
flanders
the
beer
does
not
balance
well
or
compensate
for
the
harsh
mouthfeel
probably
the
most
disappointing
of
the
arcadia
big
beer
series
ive
now
read
some
other
reviews
wow
this
one
is
all
over
the
board
im
guessing
that
some
age
time
does
wonders
with
it
drinkability
a
beer
that
left
me
wanting
more
depth
and
character
and
less
much
less
tart
fruitiness
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
dense
tan
head
that
left
a
nice
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
spicymedicinal
anise
woody
perhaps
some
vanilla
cant
quite
but
my
finger
on
it
the
brew
has
a
mild
grapefruit
hop
flavor
a
dusty
chocolate
malt
presence
a
touch
of
wine
grapes
boozy
at
the
end
the
feel
is
creamy
enough
carbonation
to
make
the
tongue
tingle
moderate
body
some
alcohol
burn
in
the
end
a
combination
of
an
old
ale
and
an
american
strong
ale
not
as
blunt
and
over
the
head
as
a
asa
but
not
quite
as
smooth
as
an
old
ale
a
bit
too
boozy
i
thought
it
had
a
good
flavor
range
and
is
worth
trying
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
falls
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
caramel
alcohol
and
some
hops
the
flavor
is
very
malty
but
also
has
a
roasted
flavor
along
with
plenty
of
caramel
that
is
followed
up
with
a
medium
bitterness
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
the
body
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
just
ok
overall
a
nice
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
huge
creamy
offwhite
head
tons
of
creamy
sticky
lacing
islands
the
nose
is
malty
slight
yeast
plums
raisins
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
fruity
and
a
good
dose
of
caramel
the
finish
is
sweet
and
dry
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
medium
body
a
well
rounded
slightly
complex
brew
very
drinkable
really
enjoying
this
one
very
tasty
highly
recommended
better
stuff
out
there
not
sure
what
to
say
here
ive
tried
a
couple
of
the
arcadia
big
beers
and
both
have
been
mediocre
at
best
this
one
pours
alright
nice
brownumber
color
with
a
nice
little
finger
of
head
on
top
that
disappears
fairly
fast
nose
is
oddly
mild
for
an
asa
some
slight
sourness
a
hint
of
fruit
and
malt
mouth
is
a
big
ball
of
sourness
comes
on
really
strong
at
the
end
too
in
a
garbage
aftertaste
that
gets
worse
as
the
beer
warms
i
guess
theres
some
fruit
maybe
malt
in
there
too
but
the
sourness
overwhelms
pretty
much
everything
else
ugh
im
okay
with
sour
beers
when
i
feel
that
its
done
deliberately
and
with
a
bit
of
a
balancing
act
its
just
too
much
here
beer
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
i
guess
you
could
drink
this
although
whats
the
point
just
got
back
in
town
in
michigan
so
ive
been
giving
the
locals
a
shot
but
im
kinda
running
out
of
steam
with
arcadia
think
ill
stick
with
the
founders
and
bells
instead
thanks
vancer
for
the
opportunity
this
was
a
beer
that
i
asked
for
so
it
doesnt
reflect
on
you
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
i
dont
anticipate
doing
this
one
again
this
is
an
odd
one
sampled
from
a
bomber
poured
into
a
regular
pint
glass
half
inch
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
to
a
surface
foam
with
minimal
lacing
no
doubt
due
to
the
elevated
abv
color
is
pretty
close
to
a
classic
old
ale
deep
ambercopper
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
some
fruit
raison
slight
banana
overtones
upon
aeration
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
malt
dominating
little
hop
finish
not
really
an
old
ale
taste
though
although
i
cant
exactly
peg
the
flavour
style
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
good
pretty
soft
carbonation
i
definitely
felt
the
abv
so
i
reduced
the
drinkability
from
average
all
in
all
i
liked
this
one
even
though
it
is
not
a
true
old
ale
pours
a
ruddy
brown
in
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
spices
maybe
a
bit
of
ginger
along
with
a
good
dose
of
cherry
a
nice
spiced
bread
aroma
taste
is
quite
similar
with
more
of
the
cherry
coming
thru
a
slight
tartness
mixes
with
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
medium
to
heavy
in
body
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
finish
but
not
extremely
noticeable
or
overpowering
this
beer
pretty
much
threw
me
for
a
loop
i
expected
an
old
ale
and
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
somewhat
festive
winter
warmer
or
strong
ale
with
all
the
cherry
flavor
and
spices
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
but
definitely
not
an
old
ale
at
least
this
bottle
overall
a
fantastic
smell
and
a
good
all
around
flavor
just
lacks
a
little
mouthweight
and
richness
in
flavor
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
very
soft
carbonation
no
taste
of
alcohol
no
lingering
bitterness
just
a
feint
reminder
of
lightly
toasted
english
malts
fairly
easy
to
drink
despite
high
abv
md
for
a
highish
abv
rather
bottomsupable
a
nice
layered
flavor
even
with
having
high
hopes
for
the
style

quality

8
abv
coupled
with
an
odd

sends
this

down

this

not

the

poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
topped
a
thin
fizzy
off

not
much
to
the
nose
i
got
some
dark
caramel
and
a
little
milk
chocolate
nothing
really
in
the
aroma
from
hops
the
taste
has
more
of
the
dark
caramel
some
dark
chocolate
a
light
note
of
dates
again
not
much
from
the
hops
just
a
light
bitterness
that
lingers
but
no
real
flavor
character
the
beer
is
a
little
sour
and
has
some
heat
on
the

the
mouth
feel
is
thin
really
not
much

it
is
in

sorry
i
hate
to
hate
but
i
gotta
call
it
as
i
see
it
d
pretty
average
for
the

this
one
needs
something
more
to
make
it
interesting
a
barrel
aged
version
of
this
might
introduce
some
much

that
is
worth

try
not
one
that
i
will
rush
back
into
having
again
any
time
soon
as
personally
this
didnt
hit
the
spot
this
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
its
not
a
very
complicated
beer
i
dont
know

to
drinking
this

my
expectations
were
too
high
you
know
what
they
say
about

its

that
gets
better

i
will
probably
not

catches
up

you

imaging
this

age

on
to
this
one
for
about
two
years
a
12

uncapped

into

the

around
two
fingers

and
flavor
consist
of
lots
of
brown
sugar
molasses
dates
raisins
figs
pine
oak
vanilla
dried
cherries
nearly
full
bodied
with
just
about
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
for
an
old
ale
of
this
age
quite
smooth
drinking
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
throat
as
the
ale
warms
very
nice
dark
amber
to
brown
in
color
and
quite
murky
due
to
high
sediment
the
sediment
was
a
surprise
as
i
poured
carefully
into
two
glasses
for
my
brotherinlaw
and
i
and
dumped
the
bottom
i
figure
some
of
the
sediment
was
suspended
in
the
bottle
somehow
as
it
wasnt
settled
out
despite
having
sat
in
my
fridge
for
about
a
month
stong
malt
nose
with
just
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
and
perhaps
some
evergreen
notes
strong
flavors
of
malt
with
quite
a
bit
of
booze
presence
there
are
some
bits
of
wood
flavors
presumably
oak
but
it
really
just
comes
in
as
wood
about
what
i
expected
for
the
style
not
as
drinkable
as
i
had
hoped
i
think
that
the
mouthfeel
and
the
body
was
failing
a
bit
to
carry
the
alcohol
i
suppose
its
pretty
decent
but
not
my
favorite
there
does
seem
to
be
some
spice
and
evergreen
in
the
finish
and
as
i
grow
comfortable
with
this
beer
it
begins
to
grow
on
me
a
little
bit
the
mouth
is
full
and
warm
the
alcohol
hiding
but
not
biting
carbonation
is
just
enough
everything
in
this
department
fits
well
into
the
whole
taste
is
wallowing
in
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
the
booze
isnt
oppressive
but
it
doesnt
hide
at
all
and
i
really
like
it
its
a
strong
heady
beast
of
a
beer
have
to
take
some
time
to
get
through
it
but
its
a
treat
bitterness
is
spot
on
toasted
grains
and
caramel
malts
quite
nice
in
all
a
good
beer
a
good
name
a
must
try
for
big
beer
fans
d
big
flavors
and
sweetness
not
to
mention
the
10
alcohol
make
this
a
sipper
rather
than
a
guzzler
however
this
is
a
smooth
drink
and
goes
down
quite
easy
very
dangerous
combination

this
is
my

but
this

was
just
offbalance
to
me

even

so
my
comments
here
are
not
on

side
however
this
past

i
opened
and
shared
a
bottle
of
fullers
vintage
ale
from
1999
and
damn
was
that
tasty
15
years
out
and
still
kickin
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
getting
when
you
can
i
would
highly
advise
to
get
two
in
order
to
age
one
since
the
notes
taste
like
it
will
become
even
richer
with
a
bit
more
aging
i
dig
old
ales
and
this
is
a
fun

really
should
pick
up

doff
my
hat
to
you
o
a

ale
kind
of
like
a
mild

nothing
spectacular
but
its
tasty
o
brilliant
if
a

strong
in
the
alcohol
tastes
maybe
i
should
have
cellared
it

2011
edition
enjoyed
late
2014
so
the
time
is
now
hazy
copper
colored
liquid
with
some
viscosity
and
still
a
nice
off
white
head
but
it
fades
pretty
fast
a
nose
of
caramel
biscuits
dried
apricots
english
ale
yeast
and
slight
but
not
offensive
oxidation
the
alcohol
cuts
the
malt
sweetness
and
there
is
some
nice
depth
to
this
between
the
yeast
and
the
layered
sweet
grain
barley
at
its
finest
lots
of
body
excellent
carbonation
butterscotch
toffee
golden
raisin
and
bittering
hops
are
all
there
the
flavors
have
become
really
well
integrated
over
time
i
can
only
imagine
an
intense
and
moderately
disjointed
beverage
fresh
but
the
time
has
made
it
nice
i
dont
taste
much
alcohol
here
but
i
get
an
apple
wine
sort
of
flavor
and
warming
thing
late
great
beer
overall
if
you
like
the
patient
english
stuff
this
is
not
to
be
missed
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
purchasing
again
i
wish
the
hops
werent
as
pronounced
but
possibly
after
the
4
year
peak
it
will
be
less
noticeable
thats
just
my
personal
taste
overall
i
need
to
get
another
one
of
these
and
allow
it
to
sleep
in
my
cellar
longer
final
thoughts
im
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
going
in
to
this
one
but
fullers
has
seriously
impressed
me
with
their
bitter
and
porter
offerings
ive
got
to
give
it
to
them
here
against
all
odds
the
hop
flavor
lasted
more
than
three
years
makes
me
wonder
how
this
thing
drinks
fresh
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
goes
does
too
easily
for
a
beer
this
size
smooth
and
not
bursting
with
flavor
but
flavorful
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
more
influential
old
ales
its
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
the
style
and
a
staple
in
any
cellar
the
amount
of
improvement
from
one
year
to
two
is
pretty
substantial
this
would
be
a
fun
one
to
do
a
large
vertical
on
to
see
where
the
peak
is
i
think
at
2
years
it
is
still
moving
upward
the
balancing
with
the
hops
on
this
one
is
unlike
any
old
ale
i
have
had
before
i
look
forward
to
slowly
stocking
my
cellar
with
these
boxes

i

im

i
liked
this
beer
given

lofty

that
i
had

im
surprised
that
i
enjoyed
this
much
highly
recommended

must
for

who
enjoy

overall
a
really
nice

cheers
my
favorite
beer
from
fullers
and
one
of
the
greatest
english
ales
of
all
if
you
can
find
it
go
for
it
o
neither
bad
nor
amazing
reminiscent
of
a
thinner
less
complex
double
dba
a
really
pleasant
strong
ale
that
doesnt
blow
you
out
with
too
many
crazy
flavors
if
it
is
a
single
malt
and
single
hop
beer
like
the
label
makes
it
sound
then
its
got
a
lot
of
nuance
for
a
simple
beer
just
well
put
together
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation

this
is
a

of

it

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
im
probably
sampling
slightly
too
cold
but
see
hints
of
nice
old
ale
more
alcohol
and
less
of
a
rich
sherry
flavor
than
i
might
expect
i
would
recommend
that
you
try
it
but
this
bottle
was
obviously
not
what
the
brewer
intended
o
not
the
most
inspirational
beer
but
still
complex
and
im
yet
to
have
a
barley
wine
that
has
been
less
than
excellent
a
decent
beer
but
probably
better
when
fresh
it
would
be
better
to
have
the
hops
shine
through
o
drinks
a
bit
stronger
that
8
5
that
being
said
the
drinkability
is
okay
not
something
your
gonna
want
to
drink
all
night
overall
it
is
tasty
and
im
curious
to
see
what
the
2009
2011
are
going
to
taste
like
i
will
sit
on
my
2013
for
many
years
after
tasting
this
since
it
still
seems
pretty
true
to
what
it
was
fresh
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
when
i
opened
this
but
im
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
definite
malt
bomb
though
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
alcohol
in
the
flavor
not
as
good
as
something
like
adam
but
still
really
well
made
and
full
of
nicely
harmonized
flavors
this
walks
that
line
between
english
barleywine
and
old
ale
o
fullers
vintage
is
an
annual
purchase
for
me
i
usually
get
a
couple
of
bottles
every
year
this
was
my
last
2010
and
it
was
quite
enjoyable
i
can
only
hope
the
other
years
i
have
age
as
well
the
brandy
and
dark
fruit
flavors
were
quite
enjoyable
a
good
sipper
hazy
dark
copper
color
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
rich
malty
aroma
toffee
caramel
raisins
more
of
the
same
with
the
taste
but
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
some
earthy
bitterness
to
even
things
out
smooth
silky
body
moderate
soft
carbonation
very
tasty
overall
b
overall
excellent
beer
full
of
complexity
wish
i
had
some
space
so
that
i
could
age
a
couple
of
these
for
a
couple
of
years
to
see
how
they
taste
then
highly
recommended
to
try
at
least
once
even
given
the
hefty
price
tag
otremendous
for
the
category
although
a
bit
pricey
value
wise
understandably
the
import
adds
a
few
to
the
bottle
im
sure
but
its
a
great
representation
of
the
traditional
british
ale
overall
a
very
deep
and
complex
beer
there
is
really
a
lot
going
on
here
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
it
is
a
wonderful
drinking
experience
i
really
with
i
could
try
some
of
the
other
vintages
for
the
sake
of
completion
i
reedited
had
the
2000
vintage
in
2014
different
fish
food
entirely
would
have
rated
it
way
closer
to
5
overall
a
beautiful
beer
that
i
look
to
grab
any
time
i
see
in
the
store
its
perfect
for
the
cellar
and
while
its
served
in
a
pint
sharing
this
beaut
will
be
sure
to
please
any
guest
o
a
great
english
ale
the
aging
has
really
made
it
fantastic
nice
bottle
very
old
fashioned
and
austere
whats
inside
is
even
better
pours
a
light
toasty
orange
that
makes
one
think
mellow
but
complex
aged
yet
dynamic
a
whiff
of
the
light
caramel
colored
head
evokes
fine
scotch
whisky
and
butterscotch
coffee
cake
and
sweet
orange
palate
shows
a
mindblowing
complexity
that
includes
the
aforementioned
aroma
components
along
with
citrus
marmalade
brown
sugar
nutmegmace
vanilla
toffee
dates
tobacco
and
bitter
brazil
nuts
a
sipper
that
wont
get
dull
as
each
sip
reveals
something
new
with
each
component
falling
into
the
dark
and
sweet
categories
hops
prevent
things
from
being
too
decadent
and
add
spicy
earthy
notes
body
is
not
as
heavy
as
excepted
but
still
pretty
chewy
think
a
strong
brown
ale
and
finish
is
winey
and
aromatic
the
sort
of
beer
that
might
cause
a
paradigm
shift
in
any
novices
who
happen
to
be
around
when
you
partake
and
worth
every
penny
will
change
with
age
the
present
exemplar
was
almost
three
years
old
really
nicely
done
could
see
myself
savoring
a
pint
of
this
for
an
extended
period
after
a
nice
meal
or
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
this
is
a
nice
beer
all
around
it
was
a
present
from
my
wife
who
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
beer
she
just
thought
it
looked
fancy
in
the
box
im
glad
she
picked
this
up
for
me
for
christmas
i
feel
like
the
few
months
in
the
cellar
have
done
this
one
well
not
sure
about
its
cost
but
this
seems
like
an
affordable
beer
and
very
spot
on
for
the
style
ill
go
ahead
and
recommend
it
o
a
nice
old
ale
the
sweet
malt
flavors
are
great
i
might
grab
some
more
of
this
to
hang
onto
and
see
how
its
tasting
after
the
hops
fade
out
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
complex
beer
which
tastes
more
like
a
beer
of
10abv
i
will
buy
another
bottle
to
cellar
surprisingly
little
to
comment
on
as
it
is
very
well
done
though
not
forging
any
real
new
ground
appearance
is
a
solid
ale
thick
head
dies
down
to
leave
not
much
in
the
lacing
nose
is
the
best
part
fruity
figgy
leather
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
is
very
inviting
a
bit
of
plum
leather
and
clove
in
the
taste
very
nice
presentation
packaging
gets
bonus
points
o
this
is
a
truly
superb
brew
that
captures
the
best
of
the
british
isles
akin
to
a
german
doppelbock
this
has
a
biscuity
quality
i
have
come
to
love
in
real
british
ales
along
with
the
subtle
understatement
of
goldings
i
am
going
to
get
more
of
these
laying
them
down
for
34
years
as
recommended
burnt
taste
really
like
black
tea
it
is
very
bitter
the
flavors
of
malt
and
hops
are
intertwined
tried
vintage
2010
apparently
was
too
young
such
beer
to
withstand
the
maximum
only
if
it
is
fully
revealed
suffice
it
to
yourself
to
get
a
certain
characteristics
to
safely
call
it
in
english
tough
ale
o
a
very
solid
old
ale
i
would
love
to
try
some
older
vintages
and
have
no
doubt
this
would
age
well
im
very
glad
i
let
this
one
rest
a
bit
before
giving
it
a
go
i
imagine
that
a
fresh
one
would
be
very
sweet
and
very
boozy
i
will
have
to
get
another
one
of
these
once
they
are
available
again
to
sit
in
my
cellar
for
a
while
2008
vintage
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
an
amber
orangey
gold
color
good
carbonation
decent
head
and
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
up
front
but
chalk
and
metallic
notes
in
the
aftertaste
that
come
and
go
tastes
a
lot
like
an
americanstyle
barley
wine
but
not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
for
a
slightly
older
vintage
still
worth
trying
once
overall
starts
off
nice
enough
but
loses
steam
and
really
doesnt
leave
a
great
final
impression
elements
are
there
to
make
it
great
but
needs
a
little
something
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
fruit
and
some
slight
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
but
slightly
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
this
fresh
but
i
would
be
curious
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
one
had
a
2009
vintage
in
the
cellar
and
drank
it
tonight
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
amber
color
very
nice
clarity
soapy
white
head
formed
then
faded
quickly
some
carbonation
left
but
some
loss
is
detected
smell
was
ripe
figs
and
caramel
taste
was
very
nice
sweet
malt
dominates
the
mouthfeel
was
amazing
super
smooth
and
velvety
went
down
like
an
aged
port
wine
just
a
bit
of
booze
but
delicious
what
a
nice
beer
aging
this
ale
for
34
years
did
wonders
this
was
a
2009
vintage
bottle
number
133946
consumed
december
2012
o
i
wonder
what
my
thoughts
would
have
been
had
i
not
had
a
2000
jw
lees
first
they
are
different
beers
for
sure
but
they
occupy
a
similar
category
in
my
mind
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
just
missing
a
few
key
elements
still
very
enjoyable
o
interesting
old
ale
lots
of
toastiness
and
nuttiness
prominent
typical
english
hops
sweet
and
fairly
complex
feels
more
like
an
english
strong
ale
than
an
olde
ale
to
me
i
will
have
to
compare
this
to
an
aged
version
sometime
tasty
murky
brownishred
colour
cap
of
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of

is
of
sweet

malty
with
lots
of
fruit
cherry
fig

up
another
and
sit
on
it
for
a
year
or
two
and
really
give
the
taste
time
to
develop
further
nonetheless
still
a
treat
to
drink
in
its
fresher
current
state
overall
not
brilliant
but
looking
forward
to
a
10
year
vertical
mf
probably
one
of
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
all
beers
should
taste
like
this
one
an
absolute
classic
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
simply
superb
love
the
richness
and
complexity
of
the
flavors
the
fact
that
there
is
a
store
near
me
that
has
six
more
dusty
boxes
of
this
fills
me
with
glee
and
i
will
be
restocking
2007
vintage
ive
long
eyed
this
boxed
bottle
and
now
i
finally
get
to
try
some
of
the
innards
it
pours
a
lightlybrackish
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
minor
bit
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
red
apple
skin
sweet
caramel
and
perfumey
flowers
the
taste
is
an
unpleasant
melange
of
honey
cerumen
and
light
biscuit
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
im
not
sure
if
the
age
somehow
got
to
this
one
early
or
something
but
either
way
it
did
not
sit
well
with
my
tongue
it
actually
hurt
a
little
to
drink
at
times
overall
an
excellent
drink
to
be
enjoyed
more
like
a
whiskey
or
port
pours
dark
redamber
slightly
hazy
but
not
cloudy
malty
caramel
flavours
and
a
sherrylike
after
taste
good
fullbodied
mouth
feel
id
liked
it
a
lot
didnt
keep
the
bottle
number
im
afraid
2012
really
really
inpressed
i
hope
my
2011
version
is
as
good
when
i
open
that
very
well
balanced
and
flavorful
which
fades
slowly
away
with
no
clear
passage
to
an
aftertaste
mouthfeel
hits
the
mark
nicely
despite
the
fizzy
bottleconditioned
carbonation
it
doesnt
hit
the
tongue
harshly
nor
does
it
fade
too
quickly
slightly
sticky
coating
the
tongue
a
bit
very
good
for
what
id
describe
as
a
sipping
beer
overall
this
young
fullers
2012
was
a
solid
offering
very
interested
in
seeing
how
it
develops
over
time
overall
very
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
even
without
any
age
on
it
its
a
delicious
beer
but
i
hoped
for
a
little
more
complexity
maybe
it
will
be
different
with
a
few
years
on
it
o
while
i
wouldnt
call
it
great
i
will
say
that
i
really
appreciate
its
elegance
and
subtlety
dont
know
if
id
pay
10
for
a
bottle
again
but
its
well
worth
a
shot
final
grade
4
32
an
outstanding
a
grade
very
impressive
stuff
not
that
i
expected
anything
less
from
fullers
smooth
balanced
richtasting
and
wholly
satisfying
fullers
vintage
ale
is
a
fabulous
relatively
affordable
introduction
to
the
style
that
i
must
highly
recommend
to
any
and
all
bas
the
slight
warmth
from
the
abv
and
rich
complex
malty
flavour
makes
this
a
perfect
selection
for
a
late
fallearly
winter
night
i
may
need
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
hold
onto
it
for
a
while
since
it
seems
likely
this
is
the
sort
of
brew
that
will
improve
with
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
o
i
love
that
crisp
dry
attenuation
character
you
get
with
some
english
old
ales
the
mouthfeel
isnt
perfect
but
besides
that
this
is
really
nice
not
sure
how
readily
available
around
the
us
but
easily
accessible
in
panew
jersey
bottle
prices
range
from
8
99
to
14
99
have
had
every
year
except
1997
which
i
will
open
and
review
113
have
been
waiting
a
while
to
do
so
seek
this
brew
from
what
i
have
tasted
if
properly
stored
it
doesnt
matter
what
year
you
find
it
was
certainly
drinkable
but
im
finding
it
funny
how
many
bottleconditioned
highergravity
uk
strong
old
ales
that
i
get
are
straightup
infected
the
majority
so
far
leaves
me
to
wonder
why
they
are
even
sent
over
here
if
the
brewery
andor
the
distributors
and
retail
outlets
cant
or
wont
handle
them
properly
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
booze
aftertaste
a
nice
beer
but
i
would
have
scored
it
higher
if
the
alcohol
was
less
prominent
medium
bodied
sticky
on
the
lips
slightly
syrupy
o
highly
recommended
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
complex
and
different
and
interesting
compared
with
a
fresh
beer
ive
aged
a
couple
beers
but
usually
not
this
long
in
addition
i
more
fully
see
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
kasteel
cuvee
du
chateau
as
a
result
of
drinking
this
brew
finish
is
slightly
bitter
full
bodied
and
still
a
touch
sweet
the
pour
is
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
a
bit
of
a
sherrylike
aroma
quite
fruity
raisins
and
cherries
with
some
vanilla
and
cream
interesting
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
heavy
on
the
vanilla
sweet
fruit
sugar
and
caramel
a
touch
of
sherry
and
oxidation
in
there
as
well
drinkability
although
its
not
a
fantastic
old
ale
i
found
it
surprisingly
drinkable
for
8
5abv
and
went
through
the
bottle
far
quicker
than
expected
so
ill
bump
up
the
overall
score
by
a
half
point
each
bottle
of
fullers
vintage
ale
is
numbered
httpabarwithnoname

com
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
should
be
sitting
and
aging
in
every
true
beer
lovers
cellar
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
and
flavorful
beer
that
i
will
definitely
search
out
in
the
future
worth
the
buy
and
holds
up
well
to
age
doa
very
inviting
nose
with
good
taste
and
a
bit
of
an
averageunexciting
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
fullbodied
texture
overall
the
fullers
vintage
ales
truly
are
tasty
treat
well
worth
the
price
per
bottle
o
awesome
beer
rich
and
warming
with
a
good
amount
of
booze
this
is
an
absolutely
world
class
beer
that
shows
amazing
potential
to
age
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
2009
vintage
that
i
plan
on
hanging
on
to
for
a
few
more
years
overall
i
didnt
know
much
about
this
one
going
in
but
i
was
quite
happy
with
it
a
very
nice
after
dinner
beer
d
expletives
should
be
used
here
this
one
hasnt
even
reached
its
peak
which
the
brewery
states
is
34
years
of
aging
yet
it
is
perfect
to
me
after
only
two
i
hold
much
delight
in
knowing
that
i
can
grab
a
couple
more
bottles
of
the
2010
to
lay
down
for
a
few
more
years
this
is
a
commanding
beer
fit
for
celebration
and
commencement
and
when
we
cross
paths
again
it
wont
be
used
for
amusement
on
a
boring
tuesday
night
overall
this
beer
smells
nice
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
tastes
like
a
belgian
triple
to
me
not
an
old
ale
it
let
me
down
a
little
bit
decent
beer
but
if
you
want
a
really
good
old
ale
get
yourself
some
hair
of
the
dog
adam
pours
a
warm
amber
color
with
a
small
beige
cap
the
glass
glows
with
beer
as
the
lacing
slowly
slides
down
the
walls
the
aroma
is
rich
with
sugary
malt
notes
toffee
dates
raisins
light
citrus
pastry
dough
caramel
coffee
cake
honey
earth
wood
fresh
biscuits
and
glazed
donuts
are
some
flavors
that
come
to
mind
the
taste
is
luxuriously
sweet
like
wrapping
your
tongue
in
a
warm
blanket
of
malt
candy
theres
still
a
touch
of
hop
presence
from
the
challengernorthdown
and
it
comes
across
with
a
light
resin
and
earth
bitterness
in
the
finish
lots
of
honey
and
dark
fruit
its
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
alcohol
warms
the
palate
carbonation
is
light
a
tasty
tasty
beer
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
pretty
rich
lasting
beer
although
it
might
not
be
worth
the
price
o
i
definitely
need
to
try
a
different
sample
to
gain
a
better
appreciation
but
certainly
a
delicious
ale
chestnut
brown
in
colour
lightly
murky
with
a
cream
coloured
head
light
retention
and
lacing
nose
is
incredibly
malty
and
complex
dark
fruits
of
fig
and
date
leanings
brown
sugar
and
leather
taste
has
more
of
the
same
and
the
malts
are
similarly
if
not
more
complex
in
design
brown
sugar
leather
light
butterscotch
and
fruits
similar
to
the
nose
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
light
acidity
in
the
finish
medium
full
mouthfeel
smooth
and
subdued
carbonation
this
has
matured
or
held
up
well
for
6
years
note
the
next
day
i
woke
up
and
spent
the
following
weekend
sick
with
the
flu
i
think
my
senses
started
to
get
compromised
perhaps
evaluating
this
brew
i
think
trying
this
again
in
the
future
is
in
the
cards
o
an
english
classic
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
good
lord
is
this
tasty
rich
and
quite
decadent
with
a
blend
of
raisins
plums
toffee
burnt
sugar
and
a
little
nougat
this
is
quite
exceptional
apparently
this
vintage
was
100
optic
malt
never
heard
of
it
and
this
pale
malt
coupled
with
a
long
boil
has
picked
up
a
lot
of
character
fruity
and
ripe
with
even
a
bit
of
bright
fruits
pineapple
and
citrus
to
go
with
the
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
this
is
pretty
good
brown
sugar
on
the
midpalate
with
dark
honey
and
again
the
burnt
sugar
mildly
bitter
on
the
finish
grainy
mostly
this
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
really
really
good
lingering
fruit
and
toffee
are
present
on
the
finish
along
with
just
a
little
bitterness
this
is
like
a
good
rummy
fruitcake
i
wish
i
bought
more
of
this
i
can
see
a
decade
doing
wonders
for
this
overall
a
real
treat
at
around
7
50
a
bottle
its
not
something
ill
be
drinking
regularly
but
everyone
should
be
trying
a
few
beers
like
this
the
real
difference
is
the
sheer
complexity
of
the
taste
which
can
really
only
be
achieved
with
aging
i
had
a
bottle
of
the
2012
vintage
a
few
days
ago
and
the
difference
was
stark
the
new
release
is
certainly
nice
enough
but
very
one
dimensional
compared
to
its
much
older
brother
o
a
very
solid
brew
with
all
of
the
english
ale
characteristics
that
i
enjoy
very
tasty
treat
exceptionally
smooth
overall
a
copper
body
with
a
smallsmall
head
quite
a
sweet
nose
with
caramel
being
at
the
fore
the
body
has
a
light
crystal
malt
character
along
wih
some
mild
butter
and
light
spice
notes
disappointed
by
this
beer
but
maybe
because
i
had
been
expecting
so
much
and
had
many
other
better
beers
that
night
the
reveal
fullers
2009
vintage
ale
a
very
nice
malty
treat
for
a
chilly
cincinnati
morning
thanks
thirstyherf
for
another
great
beer
i
dont
know
how
this
one
never
hit
my
radar
though
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
it
really
didnt
wow
me
as
much
as
i
had
thought
it
would
price
tag
keeps
this
from
being
a
regular
in
my
house
but
its
an
enjoyable
treat
every
now
and
then
notes
well
kept
for
bottle
in
a
box
mellow
chock
full
of
fruit
this
is
exceptional
strong
carbonation
and
head
malty
good
after
taste
smells
like
a
triple
too
bad
it
is
limited
to
85000
bottles
but
maybe
it
is
a
good
idea
at
9
95
for
500ml
one
could
go
broke
o
i
was
thoroughly
surprised
by
how
well
this
beer
has
aged
the
complexity
is
beautiful
and
the
balance
start
to
finish
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
not
sure
if
all
the
vintages
will
age
like
this
however
if
you
have
access
to
trying
the
1999
make
it
happen
well
worth
it
it
will
probably
last
for
many
years
to
come
as
well
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
o
wonderful
old
ale
very
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
last
year
highly
recommended
for
all
baers
to
grab
one
in
passing
this
is
a
commercial
brew
that
has
love
and
thought
put
into
it
strange
perhaps
nb
coors
and
sam
could
learn
a
lesson
or
two
overall
this
is
an
excellent
old
ale
that
is
perfect
for
sipping
on
a
cold
day
or
special
occasion
it
has
held
up
quite
well
in
the
cellar
for
the
past
three
years
with
no
apparent
harm
also
an
excellent
value
at
only
8
00
for
a
bottle
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
nice
aroma
and
palate
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
id
like
to
age
one
to
see
how
it
changes
i
imagine
itd
age
well
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
taste
was
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
an
more
an
exceptional
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
there
should
be
more
hype
surrounding
this
beer
o
a
beautiful
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
complex
in
flavour
the
older
the
bottle
the
better
the
flavor
it
tends
to
be
less
bitter
with
time
but
better
cherry
like
notes
m
creamy
rounded
very
drinkable
i
bought
a
few
to
put
down
and
see
how
they
develop
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
in
a
few
years
i
like
it
more
than
the
2010
edition
and
expect
the
wood
and
fruit
character
to
really
shine
overall
a
really
excellent
beer
with
3
years
on
it
i
think
its
drinking
very
nicely
i
would
love
to
have
another
bottle
with
a
little
more
age
on
it
to
see
how
it
changes
o
first
time
having
this
beer
and
it
was
nice
although
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
off
to
me
might
pick
some
up
and
age
them
for
a
bit
to
see
what
happens
fullers
vintage
ale
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
w
an
orange
hue
to
the
brew
a
very
nice
one
finger
off
white
head
as
well
which
quickly
disappears
to
a
sliver
fairly
clear
and
im
able
to
see
through
it
wo
a
problem
the
smell
is
of
caramel
toffee
dark
fruit
w
a
sweet
character
to
it
taste
follows
the
same
profile
and
comes
very
close
to
getting
bumped
up
to
the
next
score
this
is
a
delicious
beer
feel
is
fantastic
very
light
smooth
and
composed
with
a
million
different
things
happening
inside
your
palate
overall
this
is
a
definite
buy
if
you
see
it
i
imagine
it
would
age
well
i
may
pick
up
another
and
try
and
cellar
it
cheers
yes
its
good
but
its
really
no
better
than
golden
pride
and
it
manages
to
cost
twice
as
much
overall
an
old
ale
with
rich
aroma
of
complex
maltiness
esters
and
various
hops
and
hopdominated
flavor
bottle
no
54920
into
tulip
o
super
malty
and
warming
its
held
up
very
well
these
past
12
years
i
was
expecting
something
nearing
brandy
not
sure
if
the
full
12
years
were
necessary
but
it
was
pleasant
nonetheless
overall
a
little
too
much
sweetness
for
my
taste
its
a
good
ale
however
a
little
more
balance
would
have
made
it
a
lot
better
o
maybe
my
palate
is
not
advanced
enough
or
maybe
this
doesnt
have
enough
age
on
it
i
have
another
bottle
ill
probably
sit
on
for
three
of
four
more
years
then
ill
revisit
this
but
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
a
glass
im
not
going
to
bash
the
rating
too
bad
because
this
is
my
first
strong
ale
but
the
cloying
sweetness
prevented
me
from
finishing
this
beer
overall
you
need
to
drink
this
one
down
to
appreciate
it
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
have
ale
drinkers
try
notes
this
is
quite
a
nice
old
ale
defines
rather
well
a
standard
for
the
style
and
while
not
for
most
palates
if
one
likes
it
this
is
quite
the
treat
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
wish
the
actual
taste
were
more
flavorful
this
is
about
what
i
would
consider
a
bitter
with
the
amount
it
has
not
a
fail
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
d
well
crafted
if
unbalanced
maybe
just
not
my
thing
overall
a
fairly
complex
and
tasty
beverage
i
am
probably
going
to
try
to
hold
on
and
age
my
other
bottles
for
a
bit
before
trying
this
particular
vintage
again
taste
butterscotch
fig
plum
and
a
long
boozy
rum
finish
overy
nice
stuff
a
bit
expensive
mouthfeel
syrup
odd
body
medium
i
guess
creamy
and
wellblended
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
there
and
it
all
comes
together
to
create
one
taste
every
element
is
in
its
right
proportion
the
2007
vintage
is
a
juicier
version
than
its
older
counterparts
with
smacking
notes
of
apple
cider
pear
caramel
malt
and
a
dusting
of
english
hops
that
add
a
bit
of
flavor
and
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
slightly
sticky
mediumthick
in
body
and
velvety
smooth
all
the
way
through
lower
carbonation
level
than
some
of
the
others
save
the
2004
overall
a
tasty
batch
of
vintage
ale
not
quite
as
impressive
as
the
05
or
06
but
onpar
with
them
and
certainly
better
than
the
bottle
of
04
i
had
o
i
really
like
the
flavors
going
on
in
this
but
the
lack
of
body
and
malty
umph
leave
me
wanting
much
more
out
of
it
i
feel
as
it
is
its
good
but
it
could
be
great
not
worth
the
money
as
is
fullers
vintage
ale
is
a
lot
like
an
overpowered
belgian
which
is
uncharacteristic
from
a
fullers
brew
but
its
really
very
good
i
saw
one
more
bottle
at
the
store
i
wonder
how
much
better
it
will
be
years
from
now
2007
edition
opened
in
2009
bottle
114182
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
pretty
nice
for
this
beer
i
wasnt
really
expecting
that
too
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
grainy
malt
aroma
with
some
hops
in
the
mix
the
taste
was
semisweet
like
they
might
have
added
some
brown
sugar
to
it
or
caramel
maybe
the
taste
was
very
good
from
start
to
finish
though
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
very
nice
as
well
it
was
smooth
but
had
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
in
it
overall
this
beer
was
way
better
than
any
other
fullers
brew
that
ive
tried
well
worthy
trying
if
you
find
some
o
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
that
works
in
all
aspects
very
impressed
glad
i
splurged
for
this
o
overall
a
very
tasty
ale
and
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
cellar
for
a
while
it
certainly
would
age
well
over
time
next
opportunity
i
get
i
will
be
buying
multiple
bottles
tastes
of
sugar
caramel
sugar
tree
branches
honey
chives
salt
mushrooms
mediumroast
coffee
fruit
by
the
foot
rubber
hops
and
a
lot
more
that
ive
probably
forgotten
smells
the
same
but
its
mostly
just
sweet
and
very
little
else
yep
cool
beer
overall
the
2006
is
drinking
alot
better
than
it
was
2
years
ago
when
i
last
tried
it
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
2006
bottles
to
sit
on
for
a
couple
more
years
haha
great
price
for
the
actually
price
of
10
99
ehh
would
dish
it
out
but
glad
i
was
able
to
enjoy
it
verdict
fantastic
and
near
world
class
brew
find
and
drink
and
stash
a
couple
in
the
cellar
folks
finish
slight
alcohol
but
ok
also
smooth
the
light
cherry
and
malt
aroma
doesnt
do
much
for
me
but
i
really
like
how
the
flavor
develops
here
at
first
it
seemed
acidic
with
a
mix
of
berry
and
citrus
fruit
but
then
it
rolls
into
a
richer
candied
orange
rind
and
herbal
spice
the
finish
is
dry
with
floral
caramel
candy
note
from
the
malt
the
barley
plays
a
subtle
background
for
the
spicy
hops
with
gentle
dry
fruit
esters
and
hints
of
bread
crust
and
toffee
o
very
wellconceived
and
produced
brew
while
not
my
favorite
style
i
quite
enjoyed
this
as
did
my
wife
i
would
seek
it
out
again
what
a
treat
im
happy
i
waited
3
years
before
i
opened
this
fullers
has
been
and
continues
to
be
in
my
top
3
english
breweries
and
this
beer
tells
me
why
it
took
me
a
little
while
to
appreciate
its
subtleties
and
complexities
and
that
made
it
a
more
enjoyable
experience
ive
got
the
09
and
10
sitting
in
my
cellar
right
now
and
ill
be
sure
to
keep
buying
them
annually
o
the
body
is
a
shade
thin
but
it
doesnt
detract
much
from
the
flavor
profile
unbeatable
quality
for
the
6
price
finish
light
nut
with
caramel
and
a
hint
of
heat
with
a
nice
stickiness
on
the
lips
o
really
a
favorite
old
ale
of
mine
this
was
an
excellent
vintage
the
alcohol
is
nearly
muted
giving
you
the
ability
to
really
dive
into
the
deliciousness
of
this
brew
seek
this
one
out
ive
had
this
bottle
of
fullers
vintage
ale
for
over
three
years
and
it
is
certainly
drinking
fine
at
the
moment
since
i
havent
had
a
fresh
bottle
i
cant
really
compare
suffice
it
to
say
it
ages
nicely
ive
grown
to
like
english
old
ales
quite
a
bit
and
fullers
vintage
ale
is
definitely
a
fine
example
it
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
character
and
ages
extremely
well
grab
a
few
bottles
and
put
them
back
its
more
than
worth
it
ill
go
on
record
as
saying
that
there
may
be
no
beer
better
suited
to
cold
early
winter
evenings
by
the
fireplace
or
by
the
christmas
tree
or
at
the
dinner
table
with
a
roast
bird
coming
out
the
oven
fullers
vintage
ale
should
be
considered
one
of
the
beer
worlds
most
cherished
traditions
its
one
that
i
gleefully
anticipate
every
year
and
will
continue
to
definitely
improved
with
some
warmth
apparently
this
beer
is
at
its
peak
right
now
and
i
believe
it
i
will
be
buying
another
2007
to
lay
down
for
a
few
more
years
though
very
good
brew
one
of
my
personal
favorites
i
recommend
getting
a
couple
bottles
every
vintage
one
to
try
now
one
to
keep
for
later
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
hits
hard
much
more
so
than
many
beers
that
are
actually
stronger
combined
with
the
watery
taste
and
mouthdrying
effects
it
does
not
go
down
quickly
i
would
prefer
to
simply
sniff
it
for
hours
oh
well
perhaps
this
one
is
just
too
old
d
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
because
of
the
alcohol
content
but
still
drinkable
for
the
style
d
this
is
very
good
and
strikingly
similar
to
sam
smith
yorkshire
stingo
smooth
tasty
balanced
and
fairly
complex
good
beer
now
but
also
a
cellar
candidate
that
could
become
even
better

caramel
sweetness

the

the

brings
out
a

sweetness
with
a
dose
of

on

this
sat
on
my
shelf
for
a
year
and
i
opened
it
to
ring
in
2011
d
a
good
drink
but
perhaps
note
quite
ready
yet
as
it
feels
a
little
alcoholic
i
personally
prefer
brakspears
triple
which
isnt
really
marketed
for
maturation
but
which
improves
greatly
with
age
but
this
is
a
strong
contender
and
an
excellent
example
of
a
nice
vintage
ale
with
lots
of
potential
for
maturation
im
wondering
if
my
current
plan
to
buy
6
each
year
and
drink
one
each
year
aging
them
up
to
5
years
is
a
good
idea
i
quite
prefer
the
current
year
fresh
and
am
not
convinced
i
will
prefer
them
later
notes
i
wish
i
had
drank
this
about
34
years
ago
the
age
is
just
too
great
and
there
are
no
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
malt
sweetness
although
the
malt
flavor
is
complex
it
does
get
slightly
cloying
sweet
without
a
bitterness
to
complement
the
malt
profile
the
aroma
is
outstanding
and
i
wish
it
tasted
and
looked
as
good
as
it
smelled
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
on
this
one
when
it
is
cold
it
does
fade
with
some
dark
fruits
coming
through
as
it
warms
i
think
putting
some
age
on
this
one
would
improve
it
its
recommended
this
one
be
laid
down
for
34
years
and
served
at
cellar
temperature
an
amazing
brew
which
has
great
cellaring
potential
drink
some
now
and
save
more
for
later
thanks
to
dom
for
picking
this
up
for
me
while
in
london
clear
copperreddish
pour
with
a
one
finger
creamy
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
with
decent
lacing
the
earthy
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
with
hints
of
sweet
caramel
malt
toffee
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
specifically
rasins
in
the
background
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
it
smells
lots
of
biscuity
caramel
malt
and
fruitiness
with
just
a
touch
of
tang
from
the
alcohol
also
getting
hints
of
tea
brown
sugar
and
rasins
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
makes
this
a
sipper
but
pretty
drinkable
overall
im
a
huge
fan
of
fullers
and
probably
raised
my
expectations
of
this
beer
a
bit
too
much
its
a
good
solid
beer
but
slightly
disappointing
dthe
taste
stays
its
a
fun
beer
to
drink
but
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
i
think
i
might
get
another
bottle
and
let
it
age
for
another
year
or
two
just
for
fun
considering
it
was
under
10
seems
young
and
it
is
an
old
ale
so
i
can
really
imagine
this
one
to
age
very
well
drinks
well
for
an
old
ale
not
as
abrasive
as
others
in
the
style
this
beer
benefits
from
that
old
english
subtleness
i
keep
hearing
about
taste
is
also
english
hop
forward
with
spicy
and
earthy
hop
bitterness
leading
the
way
as
it
warms
you
get
some
nutty
and
slightly
toffee
maltiness
not
sweet
like
i
remember
the
2007
version
being
the
alcohol
and
hop
presence
adds
a
pleasant
dryness
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
with
perfect
carbonation
for
the
style
not
as
thick
and
syrupy
as
the
aged
version
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
fresh
or
aged
this
fresh
version
is
the
most
hop
forward
english
beer
i
have
ever
had
which
is
really
interesting
and
different
from
your
average
english
beer
or
the
highly
hopped
citruspine
bombs
from
the
us
this
brew
is
really
really
earthy
and
floral
and
slightly
spicy
which
really
showcases

ill

me
buy
two
have
one
now
and
cellar
the
other
d
high
for
this
one
might
be
too
sweet
but
its
a
nice
complex
brew
that
unfortunately
took
a
year
to
acheive
quality
tastes
somewhere
between
a
english
bitter
and
a
belgian
strong
ale
adjectives
escape
me
very
delicious
it
would
be
great
to
pair
with
nice
food
but
not
a
session
beer
pours
a
copperamber
colour
with
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
without
too
much
lacing
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
butterscotch
some
mild
earthy
hops
and
alcohol
flavour
is
quite
alcoholic
with
a
ton
of
sweetness
i
really
think
laying
down
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
couple
years
could
be
a
good
idea
d
a
bit
hot
but
an
enjoyable
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
track
this
one
down
again
though
an
understated
classic
very
well
balanced
old
world
brewing
at
its
subtle
best
a
joy
to
drink
even
though
this
bottle
is
about
as
fresh
as
can
be
its
not
even
close
to
peaking
d
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
would
love
to
have
more
of
these
once
in
a
life
time
if
you
have
one
it
is
certainly
worth
the
wait
for
me
it
was
a
very
distinctive
beer
one
that
has
left
an
impression
drinkability
very
high
this
brew
truly
is
a
work
of
art
and
the
immense
effort
is
not
only
shown
in
the
astounding
packaging
but
the
taste
as
well
a
quintessentially
excellent
english
ale
lovely
jubbly
very
good
drinkability
but
i
dont
think
that
this
is
fullers
vintage
ales
highest
point
if
the
alcohol
was
totally
hidden
this
beer
would
be
irresistible
the
alcohol
isnt
totally
hidden
however
the
drinkability
is
still
very
good
but
it
doesnt
beg
you
to
drink
it
it
is
too
proud
for
that
d
this
beer
is
absolutely
delicious
everything
melds
extremely
well
and
i
am
glad
that
it
is
an
easy
find
on
the
shelves
here
in
pa
nice
beer
to
cap
off
the
beginning
of
august
and
the
end
of
summer
unfortunately
taste
isnt
very
saturated
but
complex
from
sweet
to
fruits
plums
and
their
kindred
then
to
powerful
bitter
accord
which
becomes
round
and
dissolves
into
mild
aftertaste
very
spectacular
transformation
surprisingly
palate
stays
fresh
and
almost
neutral
i
have
been
waited
some
kind
of
heavy
strike
drink
bravely
but
i
perceived
a
lack
of
matureness
this
beer
would
be
better
kept
on
the
cellar
shelf
for
quite
a
few
years
ill
try
it
once
more
later
sure
it
will
score
more
very
memorable
i
have
5
more
bottles
for
the
future
and
am
contemplating
more
looking
forward
to
the
2010
it
will
be
excellent
with
all
red
meats
roast
chicken
turkey
wild
game
lasagna
meaty
pastas
or
even
just
a
baguette
and
cheese
ive
been
looking
at
this
beer
for
a
while
without
trying
it
now
that
i
have
tried
it
my
curiosity
will
get
the
better
of
me
and
i
dont
see
the
other
vintages
i
have
lasting
all
that
long
i
love
the
box
this
one
comes
in
and
can
only
hope
i
have
the
restraint
for
a
5
year
verticaljust
need
the
2010
wish
me
luck
good
on
the
drink
but
this
is
something
to
savor
d
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
old
ale
that
has
held
up
great
lots
of
good
caramel
malts
and
sweet
dark
fruits
would
love
to
try
again
this
is
going
to
be
a
must
stop
and
pick
up
in
the
detroit
area
on
my
way
back
to
nc
when
i
visit
grand
rapids
undoubtely
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
probably
my
personal
favorite
ever
bottle
78199
helluva
beer
had
it
stored
just
on
a
shelf
in
my
kitchen
only
chilled
it
a
couple
of
days
ago
poured
with
a
thick
foamy
frothy
fine
bubble
light
tan
head
and
good
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
brown
aroma
is
very
malty
caramel
toffee
fruit
flavor
is
like
aroma
and
the
alcohol
really
jumps
out
body
is
soft
full
creamy
smooth
and
round
including
the
great
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
including
alcohol
reminds
me
of
some
sherries
sipping
beer
be
fun
to
try
different
vintages
side
by
side
excellent
brew
got
this
from
good
friend
ron
kittleson
formerly
of
la
crosse
now
in
seattle
thanks
much
man
very
drinkable
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
so
good
that
i
almost
feel
bad
drinking
it
ages
very
well
and
you
can
bet
ill
be
saving
my
08
and
09
versions
for
quite
a
while
beer
is
thick
and
quite
sweet
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
at
the
back
but
some
caramel
notes
in
the
early
and
midpalate
minimal
carbonation
tastes
good
drinkability
suffers
for
me
its
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
probably
a
bad
beer
to
start
with
i
think
it
would
improve
with
age
duh
id
drink
it
again
d
for
its
strength
i
think
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
this
is
a
beer
i
typically
split
but
am
drinking
alone
this
time
i
am
not
complaining
though
pretty
solid
beer
every
time
i
see
a
british
beer
like
this
that
is
a
vintage
or
bottle
conditioned
i
have
to
try
it
so
far
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
they
are
always
very
tasty
beers
if
you
see
this
a
bottle
of
this
id
recommend
grabbing
it
definitely
not
something
youre
going
to
slam
down
at
a
bar
but
very
drinkable
for
the
style
ive
had
this
in
my
collection
for
a
while
and
finally
decided
after
looking
at
the
day
outside
todays
the
day
this
is
the
2008
vintage
bottle
number
06723it
pours
a
deep
toffeeamber
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
that
recedes
to
a
smog
of
lacing
across
the
topthe
smell
is
a
mixture
of
strong
carameltoffeeraisinswhiskey
and
alcoholit
has
a
pleasant
syrupy
mouthfeel
which
is
like
a
fine
port
with
tastes
of
carameltoffeeraisinsdark
fruits
and
some
cherry
alcohol
heat
right
at
the
end
but
not
over
the
top
by
any
meansits
definately
a
pleasant
brew
to
just
kick
back
with
next
to
the
fireplace
or
on
a
nice
cold
night
and
will
continue
to
buy
the
new
vintage
every
year
im
just
going
to
go
drink
this
now
i
bought
it
in
california
last
year
and
was
saving
it
for
the
right
time
i
strongly
recommend
this
brew

the
flavors
have
mellowed
out
nicely
mf
is
a
bit
lacking
thin
though
creamy
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
body
drinkability
is
surprisingly
good
for
a
robust
high
abv
ale
like
this
one
good
stuff
from
fullers
worth
checking
out
notes
its
good
just
nothing
special
and
maybe
not
worth
the
wait
maybe
this
bottle
was
a
little
mistreated
before
i
purchased
it
temperature
wise
but
not
the
complex
flavors
i
was
expecting
and
i
usually
love
everything
fullers
puts
out
d
nice
drinking
brew
not
one
to
drink
a
lot
of
just
have
it
first
and
enjoy
the
difference
definitely
an
excellent
english
brew
they
handle
the
big
stuff
well
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
still
curious
as
to
how
this
tasted
fresh
ill
have
to
wait
for
the
time
machine
to
come
in
the
mail
this
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
not
something
to
quaff
but
i
am
enjoying
more
with
each
sip
it
has
an
air
of
quality
to
it
and
i
feel
like
a
beer
of
this
stature
should
be
sipped
and
not
slopped
down
drinkability
poor
harsh
aftertaste
and
strong
unmatched
flavors
made
one
bottle
between
two
certainly
enough
to
satisfy
drinkability
worth
putting
a
few
away
for
a
while
d
savor
this
slow
its
enjoyable
not
a
session
beer
and
its
not
meant
to
be
cheers
ralphus
extremely
drinkable
for
the
content
cant
feel
the
alcohol
at
all
and
the
sweetness
and
balance
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
im
going
to
have
to
retry
the
2009
bottles
and
pick
up
some
older
ones
at
the
fullers
brewery
possibly
fullers
best
beer
d
extremely
drinkable
for
the
style
not
too
sweet
well
balanced
simple
beer
that
is
very
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
qualities
about
fullers
d
a
very
nice
beer
from
fullerswhich
i
think
will
benefit
from
another
few
years
of
cellaring
allowing
the
flavor
to
develop
more
and
to
smooth
out
the
alcohol
a
bit
more
although
it
is
already
very
well
hidden
as
it
is
now
i
much
prefer
their
1845
especially
with
the
price
difference
appearance
is
a
slightly
cloudy
reddishamber
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
head
bubbles
up
and
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
wonderfully
complex
a
perfumeysweet
melange
of
cereal
grains
and
pipe
tobacco
with
hints
of
coconut
and
bourbon
there
is
a
definite
twang
of
alcohol
but
it
is
not
unpleasant
taste
follows
smell
it
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
british
biscuity
quality
highly
caramelized
with
a
pleasing
albeit
subdued
kick
of
bready
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
the
hops
are
delicately
bitter
and
serve
mostly
to
balance
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
exquisite
coming
on
thick
and
full
but
short
of
syrupy
it
sort
of
thins
out
and
creeps
away
with
each
swallow
fantastic
drinkability
is
high
insofar
as
this
beer
goes
down
very
warm
and
smooth
altough
the
flavors
are
too
intense
to
call
it
sessionable
a
lovely
creation
from
fullers
my
favorite
oldschool
english
beer
or
should
i
say
nectar
of
the
gods
is
thomas
hardys
ale
and
this
is
sort
of
like
thomas
hardys
kid
sidekick
a
sipper
that
i
could
easily
do
2
or
3
of
a
class
act
this
is
a
2008
bottle
consumed
210
this
is
a
cloudy
orangebrown
beer
with
a
caramel
and
raisin
smell
it
has
a
rich
caramel
cherry
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
flavor
with
a
lingering
toasty
bittersweet
finish
its
full
bodied
and
sweet
without
being
sticky
im
curious
how
this
one
ages
sweet
and
a
bit
oxidized
it
feels
creamy
with
some
mild
bitterness
from
the
residual
fuggles
still
kicking
around
fairly
fruity
and
vinous
full
bodied
sipper
dont
think
id
age
it
for
this
long
in
the
future
im
getting
tired
of
oldtasting
beer
its
mellowed
a
bit
but
i
could
imagine
that
the
apricot
floral
notes
would
have
been
more
vibrant
in
days
past
worth
trying
im
not
100
sold
though
final
thoughts
if
you
are
a
fan
of
brandy
maybe
this
will
be
your
cup
of
tea
i
however
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
a
disappointment
im
not
looking
forward
to
that
bottle
of
2009
maybe
if
i
let
it
sit
for
a
year
i
can
trade
it
away
later
because
i
really
would
not
want
to
have
this
beer
again
very
interesting
ale
its
got
a
mind
of
its
own
yet
it
remains
easy
to
approach
for
anyone
go
get
a
few
bottles
and
start
aging
some
now
impression
fullers
vintage
is
a
necessary
and
enjoyable
step
along
the
way
to
fully
appreciating
the
beauty
of
fine
beer
having
had
this
beer
many
times
i
agree
with
fullers
that
it
certainly
improves
with
age
i
could
see
this
being
fine
for
another
few
years
fullers
is
certainly
a
world
class
brewery
that
makes
a
number
of
great
beers
this
is
no
exception
d
light
everything
here
flavor
aroma
feel
it
makes
for
a
drinkable
old
ale
well
crafted
but
id
hope
the
fresher
bottles
would
have
had
a
bit
more
life
to
them
aroma
and
flavorwise
the
complete
lack
of
aroma
and
one
dimensional
flavor
of
this
beer
were
disppointments
and
i
dont
consider
it
worthy
of
the
special
packaging
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
most
disappointing
beers
ive
ever
had
it
is
certainly
not
the
worst
it
really
isnt
even
bad
but
id
drink
bud
light
over
this
as
a
protest
this
beer
will
be
interesting
in
35
years
d
a
very
nice
beer
at
this
point
but
give
it
a
couple
of
years
properly
cellared
i
think
it
will
evolve
into
a
great
beer

a

very
good
beer
especially
as
it
warms
up
ddefinitly
one
to
drink
slowly
and
savor
alot
more
oxadized
than
i
was
hoping
for
that
muddles
some
of
the
other
flavors
that
would
be
present
otherwise
with
a
beer
this
old
some
is
to
be
expected
probably
had
to
do
with
storage
conditions
i
would
definitly
like
to
try
a
younger
version
to
compare
ive
found
a
bottle
of
2005
that
i
had
stashed
away
thats
next
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
by
the
complexity
to
be
honest
i
thought
it
was
gonna
be
a
bit
more
that
being
said
i
definitely
enjoyed
it

makes
this
a
sipper
for
sure
but
super
complex
and
balanced
delicious
well
worth
the
price
id
love
to
see
what
this
beer
tastes
like
in
a
few
years
given
the
abv
this
is
very
pleasant
on
the
palate
while
alcohol
can
be
tasted
its
not
burning
you
up
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
stately
from
the
bottles
appearance
to
the
final
sip
it
feels
well
pulledtogether
even
when
intended
for
a
bit
of
age
i
have
one
in
the
cellar
and
will
let
it
sit
for
a

years
before
cracking
it
2009
500ml
classy
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
colour
with
a
little
carbination
on
a
careful
pour
the
taste
is
of
dark
malts
and
sweet
dark
fruits
with
a
mild
hop
touch
very
smooth
with
a
sweet
taste
added
to
the
end
of
it
the
8
5
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
was
my
first
old
ale
and
it
was
quite
interesting
a
very
solid
beverage
overall
d
this
is
an
interesting
beverage
im
tempted
to
seek
out
an
older
one
to
find
out
how
it
does
after
a
few
years
but
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
were
told
to
age
it
i
wouldnt
immediately
get
that
idea
from
tasting
this
brew
it
has
no
overt
alcohol
tones
and
its
pretty
wellintegrated
already
d
a
decent
strong
ale
it
didnt
particularly
move
me
one
way
or
another
though
3
5
wasnt
bad
but
theyve
definitely
done
better
excellent
beer
worth
trying
im
seeking
out
a
few
others
to
compare
with
this
one
date
wise
overall
a
very
decent
brew
but
also
slightly
overrated
reccomended
its
a
drinkable
beer
for
the
alcohol
level
it
has
pours
an
orange
caramel
hue
a
sweet
butterscotch
woody
flavor
with
some
light
fruit
notes
in
the
aroma
a
dull
taste
of
wood
molasses
unsweetened
butterscotch
bitter
oranges
the
aftertaste
is
a
dull
orange
rind
off
flavor
with
tang
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
my
palate
light
in
body
with
little
to
no
carbonation
this
syrup
caramelized
ale
doesnt
stand
out
among
the
rest
of
the
pack
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
and
creamy
and
the
beer
goes
down
atreat
ive
liked
all
the
fullers
vintage
ales
that
ive
tried
so
far
but
this
2008
batch
may
replace
the
2004
as
my
favorite
one
to
date
this
is
really
delicious
i
could
drink
more
of
these
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
8
5
abv
and
the
large
size
of
the
bottle
to
start
with
i
have
also
tried
the
2010
vintage
and
found
it
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
with
lots
of
toffee
flavor
but
otherwise
similar
to
the
other
vintages
notes
this
review
is
for
a
2000
vintage
tasted
in
2004
great
sipping
brew
cant
wait
to
try
it
aged
but
i
guess
ill
have
to
i
can
sit
and
sip
this
all
night
sessionability
not
really
great
beer
but
youre
not
going
to
handle
a
lot
of
these
raisins
and
some
of
that
cidergrape
juice
i
got
in
that
aroma
somewhat
cloying
sweetness
to
be
honest
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
unique
became
smoother
as
it
warmed
an
addition
of
toffee
caramel
and
other
sweet
candies
i
have
one
to
cellar
for
a
couple
years
though
so
well
see
how
that
turns
out
drinkability
a
nice
drink
to
sip
maybe
a
little
sweet
after
having
an
entire
bottle
very
interested
to
see
what
this
is
like
in
a
few
year
s
mfd
the
beer
is
completely
creamy
and
the
perfect
body
for
an
old
ale
the
body
is
really
perfect
on
this
guy
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
for
the
style
the
only
complaints
i
have
are
that
the
carbonation
makes
the
inherent
sweetness
of
the
beer
a
bit
too
much
dark
brown
ambermaple
syrup
color
with
just
a
few
beige
bubbles
on
top
lovely
refined
aroma
of
caramel
brown
sugar
toast
and
burnt
marshmallows
cotton
candy
and
nectarine
smooth
and
fruity
with
notes
of
meringue
orange
lemon
and
rum
very
tropical
in
a
way
like
a
proper
mai
tai
infused
with
zesty
hops
sweet
but
balanced
by
a
kick
of
alcohol
and
hops
quick
in
the
finish
with
lingering
malt
syrup
flavor
a
fine
digestif
nice
flavours
a
definite
must
for
the
winter
nightfireside
sipper
crowd
a
pleasantly
warming
vintage
ale
the
old
character
meshing
well
with
the
rest
given
the
decent
balance
but
slightly
out
of
whack
alcohol
warming
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
a
few
years
in
the
bottle
have
done
to
a
couple
of
the
earlier
vintages
of
this
that
ive
been
saving
as
they
were
big
hits
when
i
brought
them
to
the
office
christmas
parties
at
the
time
the
alcohol
presence
is
very
muted
in
this
one
cant
tell
at
all
from
the
taste
that
its
over
8
abv
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
right
now
solid
appearance
great
nose
full
of
many
different
components
that
seem
to
compliment
each
other
and
balance
each
other
out
full
flavor
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
lets
on
but
great
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
bittered
extremely
well
and
balanced
by
a
nice
smooth
creamy
characteristic
to
me
this
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
i
enjoy
the
acidic
nature
of
it
offset
by
the
smoothness
i
dont
love
the
mature
flavors
i
would
imagine
that
its
better
fresher
but
the
mellowed
mouthfeel
is
worth
the
few
years
my
bottle
number
is
140956
out
150k
maybe
these
last
10000
are
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
and
not
the
best
offering
i
will
have
to
look
for
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
because
this
one
frankly
is
a
disappointment
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
although
you
dont
really
taste
the
alcohol
presence
so
much
you
feel
its
warming
qualities
easily
enough
this
will
limit
most
persons
intake
with
this
one
c
what
a
charming
beer
i
can
understand
how
the
brits
would
find
this
beer
delightful
almost
any
time
of
the
year
with
cold
damp
rainy
nights
oft
fullers
definitely
brewed
a
splendid
beer
to
style
and
allowed
a
level
of
exclusivity
through
limiting
the
production
to
145000
which
still
seems
like
a
fair
bit
though
if
you
consider
this
beer
is
being
produced
for
the
worldwide
market
not
really
cheers
overall
pretty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
my
wife
did
not
like
no
problem
i
easily
finished
hers
off
a
great
beer
for
a
celebration
2008
fullers
vintage
ale
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
copper
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
malty
light
candied
fruit
with
some
herbal
earthy
hops
malt
is
upfront
in
the
flavor
but
not
overly
sweet
more
light
fruity
flavors
with
a
crisp
finish
the
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
finish
as
well
with
more
herbal
earthy
hop
flavor
the
texture
is
creamy
and
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
the
size
drinkability
very
enjoyable
pint
for
the
100th
review
and
a
cold
rainy
spring
day
ill
savour
this
for
the
next
45
min
and
keep
the
2
others
i
have
of
this
for
a
special
occasion
in
the
future
d
fantastic
though
ive
had
a
lot
of
great
beers
during
the
journey
this
is
truly
in
the
upper
eschelon
infinitely
complex
aromas
and
flavors
make
this
a
tough
one
to
beat
i
hope
to
be
able
to
sample
various
vintages
at
various
ages
i
do
wish
i
had
more
but
it
looks
like
this
might
be
a
once
in
a
lifetime
beer
for
me
such
a
thing
is
not
meant
to
last
mouth
is
smooth
and
a
bit
oily
drinks
easy
i
would
like
to
see
what
this
would
do
in
a
few
more
years
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
i
would
like
to
sit
on
every
few
years
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
its
no
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
like
i
was
kind
of
hoping
for
but
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
enjoy
the
english
strong
ales
bitterness
dominates
again
but
maybe
in
a
more
balanced
way
than
i
described
in
my
most
recent
update
more
of
the
fruit
not
so
much
of
the
mustiness
06
vintage
poured
into
a
snifter
epic
ruby
hue
perfectly
clear
with
a
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
gobs
of
lacing
aroma
is
boozy
dark
fruits
and
carameltoffee
with
light
accents
of
cherry
cough
drops
and
toast
flavor
is
caramel
with
orange
jelly
and
hints
of
cherry
and
wheat
bread
the
sweetness
is
somewhat
tempered
by
an
earthy
hop
note
and
a
mild
tannic
character
body
is
maybe
a
little
thin
for
the
wealth
of
flavors
presented
but
theres
no
trace
of
alcohol
and
the
carbonation
while
subdued
is
appropriate
very
good
beer
an
excellent
ale
to
have
and
to
celler
for
years
to
come
ill
age
one
for
myself
also
d
a
sit
down
kick
off
your
shoes
and
sit
by
the
fire
beer
had
this
brew
for
super
bowl
great
box
and
all
that
came
with
it
this
ones
a
keeper
for
the
shelf
beer
was
very
full
flavored
only
wished
i
had
bought
another
to
let
it
age
longer
as
it
may
have
had
a
smoother
feel
to
it
tasted
a
little
young
but
still
amazing
d
this
is
one
damn
tasty
barleywine
increadibly
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
all
in
all
a
proper
wonderful
old
ale
cheers
d
well
its
a
sipper
all
right
its
too
big
a
beer
to
be
sessionable
which
is
probably
not
what
fullers
was
going
for
anyhow
but
would
make
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
winter
warmer
2008
vintage
pours
a
rich
amber
lighter
than
i
expected
for
an
old
ale
and
with
a
yellowy
white
1
inch
head
glistening
and
clear
smells
of
green
grass
malt

sweet
malty
flavor
some
hop
bitterness
malts
are
also
laced
with
red
cherries
and
hot
alcohol
hint
of
spicyvegetal
hop
flavor
mostly
its
a
big
sticky
malt
bomb
with
a
touch
of
fruit
but
it
needs
a
bit
more
time
on
it
still
i
think
syrupy
heavy
mouthfeel
i
think
this
particular
bottle
was
perhaps
a
little
too
new
i
can
see
that
it
has
potential
but
it
isnt
really
a
wellrounded
beer
at
this
stage
it
is
a
reddish
color
moderately
dark
beer
with
a
thin
english
head
smells
of
toffee
has
a
great
old
ale
taste
characteristic
of
english
beers
very
smooth
almost
syrupy
body
something
to
enjoy
or
celebrate
with
d
strong
and
robust
but
enjoyable
and
fairly
drinkable
this
is
the
05
vintage
poured
into
tulip
glass
poured
a
handsome
deep
earthy
brown
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
that
left
minimal
lacing
solid
malt
aroma
that
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
matched
with
notes
of
spice
and
soil
the
flavor
leaves
me
speechless
this
is
what
ale
tastes
like
in
heaven
full
smooth
body
that
has
the
substance
of
the
british
empire
i
could
spend
hours
with
this
beer
and
not
get
bored
those
people
who
say
they
dont
like
british
style
ales
are
fools
a
true
classic
for
the
ages
good
and
worth
trying
i
think
its
overpriced
and
they
talk
it
up
way
too
much
a
very
nice
example
of
an
old
ale
the
mouthfeel
may
throw
off
someone
thats
new
to
this
style
but
i
think
that
this
beer
can
and
will
age
very
well
if
you
have
the
patience
its
quite
drinkable
now
and
it
reminds
me
of
how
the
english
are
skilled
at
making
strong
beers
that
are
delicious
whether
you
drink
them
fresh
or
aged
i
appreciate
that
craftmanship
drinkability
is
excellent
and
this
beer
is
highly
recommended
a
bit
pricey
but
i
certainly
will
be
purchasing
this
one
again
drinkability
though
part
of
me
wishes
we
couldve
had
the
patience
to
age
this
one
a
while
its
so
rewarding
to
drink
it
now
im
almost
tempted
to
pick
up
another
couple
maybe
to
drink
maybe
to
age
have
2
more
of
these
to
age
for
a
while
taste
is
strong
malty
and
has
a
warming
alcoholic
feeling
the
malts
are
palemalty
combined
with
dark
caramel
malts
which
makes
the
beer
into
one
to
cellar
because
these
dark
malts
add
a
bit
of
a
rough
edge
to
the
beer
the
yeast
adds
a
light
fruity
taste
which
makes
the
beer
distinctly
british
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
smooth
overall
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
beer
im
very
fond
of
this
style
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
slightest
bit
im
glad
that
i
bought
a
few
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
it
develops
pours
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
small
bubbly
off0white
head
that
left
some
small
rings
of
lacing
down
the
glass
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
coming
up
from
this
one
smell
is
full
of
caramel
some
belgianlike
yeastiness
and
some
fruitiness
almost
like
spiced
apples
this
aroma
reminds
me
of
several
bspas
ive
had
in
the
past
which
is
odd
since
its
supposed
to
be
an
old
ale
but
i
like
it
taste
is
chock
full
of
caramel
covered
apple
a
bit
of
earthiness
some
woody
flavors
some
booziness
lots
of
ripe
fruit
some
herbal
lightly
bitter
hops
lightly
sweet
fairly
dry
on
the
finish
very
interesting
and
complex
and
more
subtleties
comes
out
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
crisp
on
the
finish
lots
of
carbonation
tingle
becomes
a
little
smoother
and
easy
to
drink
as
it
warms
but
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevalent
a
nice
tasting
beer
and
ill
be
sure
to
start
aging
a
bottle
of
this
every
year
as
i
think
an
aged
bottle
would
definitely
taste
a
little
better
than
a
fresh
one
d
rather
nice
for
a
9
year
old
old
ale
good
drinkability
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
this
vintages
phenols
detract
overall
maybe
a
few
more
years
will
mellow
things

look
forward

the

catch
sweet
light

scent
the
taste
is
very
sweet
hints
of
honey
and
caramel
with
a
subtle
floral
hop
presence
but
as
the
hops
fade
toward
the
finish
light
malts
are
exposed
carbonation
is
medium
and
picks
up
towards
the
finish
although
this
enhances
the
flavor
though
there
is
no
hiding
the
alcohol
though
unlike
fullers
regular
line
which
are
typically
almost
half
the
abv
overall
a
great
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
my
07s
over
the
next
3
years
d
a
sipper
but
what
a
sipper
it
is
goes
down
easily
for
its
strength
a
worldclass
british
ale
year
2008
the
aroma
is
rich
and
sweet

caramel
light
fruit

lemon
and
vanilla
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
small
but
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma

very
alcoholic

for
a
beer
at
8

the
palate
is
a
little
thin
but
ok
the
aftertaste
is
soapy
even
though
this
beer
has
some
good
qualities
the
whole
is
not
better
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
drinkability
is
wonderful
the
brew
is
quite
complex
on
the
palate
the
flavors
get
more
potent
with
a
bit
of
warming
while
the
brew
warms
the
palate
and
leaves
a
satisfying
aftertaste
making
it
a
great
winter
brew

clear

me
of

slightly
bigger
version

i
will
be
curious
to
see
how
well
it

thou
it

rather
new

did
not
come
across
any

a
classic
d
good
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
full
bottle
though
drinkability
is
all
day
long
i
wish
a
true
pub
in
the
area
would
carry
something
even
remotely
akin
to
this
brew

of
my
favorite
old
ales

my
favorite

have
one

in

d
a

after

the

made
the
experience
all
the
more
memorable
i
may
very
well
snatch
a
few
more
of
these
up
before
the
shelf
is
empty
at
my
local
store
this
one
is
pretty
delicious
i
might
have
to
revisit
this
review
with
a
bottle
under
better
conditions
another
simply
excellent
beer
from
fullers
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
what
you
expect
when
you
first
smell
this
beer
lots
of
honey
and
lightly
rosted
malts
which
are
balanced
by
the
fine
english
hops
a
really
filling
and
luxorious
beer
that
seem
to
be
really
good
material
for
cellaring
d
complex
and
wonderful
this
was
an
incredible
beer
in
which
the
abv
was
dangerously
hidden
very
drinkable
a
moderately
expensive
ale
that
was
worth
every
penny
i
paid
for
it
d
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
where
repeat
experiences
cant
be
in
disdain
drinkability
a
tasty
wellcrafted
beer
wouldnt
want
to
drink
many
though
as
this
one
blew
me
off
my
ass
a
good
sipper
for
hop
and
ale
lovers
perfect
for
the
winter
time
clear
mahogany
pour
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
malt
dark
fruit
and
hops
make
up
the
aroma
velvety
mouthfeel
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
malt
hits
you
first
with
raisins
and
hop
bitterness
to
follow
dry
earthy
finish
much
better
than
last
year
this
bottle
happened
to
be
number
81220
bottled
in
2006
and
opened
in
summer
of
2008
while
my
thengirlfriend
was
breaking
my
heart
thank
god
it
was
a
muscular
8
5
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
garnet
red
color
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
lots
of
tiny
visible
carbonation
the
retention
and
the
lacing
were
stellar
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
pungent
dark
fruit
raisins
and
zesty
alcohol
esters
the
flavors
were
also
sweet
and
enjoyable
toffee
and
candy
sugar
ripened
figs
caramel
malt
hints
of
spices
and
an
herbal
hop
finish
that
added
balance
to
an
otherwise
busy
palate
punchy
but
nonpretentious
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
the
carbonation
good
and
the
body
mediumfull
a
challenging
but
rewarding
experience
d
takes
some
time
to
drink
and
you
can
feel
it
run
down
your
throat
satisfying
nonetheless
i
would
kill
to
have
in
cask
2005
vintage
this
poured
a
semihazy
rusted
copper
color
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
malt
and
yeast
balanced
nicely
with
citrus
hops
it
had
a
subtle
but
fairly
complex
flavor
of
caramel
malt
with
a
mix
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
bitter
but
mellow
aftertaste
overall
this
was
very
good
for
a
standard
ale
if
it
was
a
little
hoppier
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
it
would
have
been
perfect
its
a
great
beer
when
its
fresh
but
i
can
tell
that
the
alcohol
can
use
a
little
time
to
settle
down
one
of
these
days
ill
buy
a
new
one
and
cellar
it
myself
where
i
know
the
conditions
d
this
is
definitely
not
intended
to
be
a
session
beer
but
rather
sipped
to
enjoy
all
the
nuances
im
not
a
big
fan
of
most
high
abv
beers
but
this
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
flavor
and
abv
im
putting
two
on
my
christmas
list
one
to
drink
and
one
to
cellar
nice
to
try
one
of
these
just
after
bottling
it
can
only
get
even
better
from
here
on
in
the
other
bottles
in
my
cellar
shall
bear
witness
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
not
too
thin
dangerously
drinkable
at
the
abv
to
be
honest
i
couldnt
put
the
thing
down
i
may
have
to
buy
another
one
and
wait
another
4
years
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
very
nice
beer
though
nick
and
i
jorge
each
rated
this
beer

was

im
a

youve
got
to

the

that
you
can
get
out
of

brewery

well
done

overall
a
highly

beer
well
above

and
it
would
interesting
to
see
how
it
ages

certainly

i

is
the

almost

understand
its

even
a

similar

does
a
better
job
its
just
not
that

good
but
not
a
great
job
probably
would
not

the

one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
ever
experienced
a

bottle
that
is

i
shared
this
with

on

i
could
not

a

i
love
big

i
love

but
this
takes
it
to
another
level
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
in
the
taste
but
i
do
feel
it
a
little
the
typical
caramel
notes
are
there
with
an
apple
pielike
spice
i
happen
to
have
homemade
apple
pie
to
eat
when
im
done
too
smooth
and
warming
world
class
very
drinkable
in
taste
slightly
limited
by
alcohol
good
overall
flavor
but
kind
of
weak
im
sure
some
age
would
develop
the
depth
of
old
ale
flavor
but
there
isnt
too
much
there
to
work
with
as
it
seems
now
not
to
downplay
it
being
a
good
beer
but
im
not
blown
away
had
a
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
and
tasted
of
caramel
malts
and
alcohol
poured
a
deep
red
with
lots
of
carbonation

a

bottle
68225
this
was
my
first
aged
ale
if
i
remember
correctly
a
new
frontier
if
you
will
poured
a
beautiful
clear
copper
color
head
was
perfect
and
the
lace
coated
the
glass
solidly
off
to
a
great
start
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
and
strongly
of
stewed
fruit
taste
was
very
port
like
with
aforementioned
stewed
fruit
notes
plums
strawberries
thick
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
ambience
in
my
opinion
i
had
this
under
the
perfect
circumstances
its
cold
and
rainy
outside
suzanne
had
the
fireplace
going
and
we
were
having
dinner
went
well
with
dinner
though
this
might
be
even
better
as
a
nightcap
i
didnt
rate
it
much
above
average
on
drinkability
because
a
sipping
ale
is
not
my
favorite
style
and
this
bad
boy
checks
in
at
almost
9
this
is
a
very
complex
well
made
beer
and
one
that
might
grow
on
me
more
if
i
had
it
regularly
seeing
its
from
fullers
seals
the
deal
very
nice
pours
a
very
attractive
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
which
alas
poops
out
pretty
quick
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
strong
scent
of
alcohol
alcohol
hits
you
right
up
front
in
the
taste
too
followed
by
a
fruity
pearlike
malt
sweetness
and
finally
a
rather
grassy
hop
finish
alcohol
taste
is
present
pretty
much
throughout
the
sip
and
a
bit
too
strong
for
the
flavor
of
the
beer
the
other
flavors
seem
a
bit
unbalanced
as
well
the
malt
and
hops
just
dont
seem
to
fit
together
very
well
mouthfeel
is
full
and
coating
which
adds
to
the
medicinal
effect
created
by
the
overstrong
alcohol
flavor
i
could
understand
these
problems
if
this
were
a
new
beer
but
this
has
been
aging
for
a
while
i
cant
see
myself
having
another
bottle
55824
poured
a
chesnut
color
with
a
bulbous
rocky
and
very
stable
head
aroma
is
at
once
both
intensly
hoppy
and
sweet
strong
alcohol
arma
is
there
as
well
the
taste
is
a
full
and
unrelenting
mix
of
gristlike
sweet
maltiness
and
british
hops
woody
and
maybe
a
little
oily
and
a
nice
bacground
of
alcohol
creamy
and
suprisingly
smooth
too
this
is
one
outstanding
beer
this
brew
poured
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
a
massive
cream
colored
head
that
reduced
down
to
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
the
head
was
rocky
and
uneven
what
a
great
looking
beer
the
aroma
was
very
strong
and
complex
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
smelled
fruity
almost
wine
like
but
as
it
warmed
it
changed
quite
a
bit
it
took
on
a
more
of
a
roasted
malt
and
carmel
aroma
with
a
definite
whiff
of
alcohol
spices
the
aroma
was
not
the
only
complex
part
about
this
beer
the
taste
was
deep
and
complex
as
well
at
first
sip
the
first
thing
that
jumped
out
was
a
sweet
malt
taste
not
a
sugar
sweet
though
the
middle
is
of
roasted
malts
and
the
carmel
which
i
noticed
in
the
aroma
the
finish
has
the
perfect
balance
with
a
little
bit
of
floral
hop
bitterness
which
complements
the
malty
front
very
well
there
is
also
hints
of
a
buttery
taste
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
spicy
alcohol
but
not
too
much
as
i
said
a
very
complex
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
silky
smooth
although
it
feels
a
little
sharp
against
the
back
of
the
throat
this
brew
hides
the
8

abv
very
well
thanks
to
a
friend
this
is
the
first
brew
ive
had
that
has
been
conditioned
for
over
a
year
this
was
a
very
excellent
brew
and
i
would
definitely
drink
again
assuming
i
could
find
it
i
was
skeptical
of
this
beer
before
i
tried
it
dont
get
me
wrong
i
think
fullers
is
a
great
brewery
but
there
is
something
about
vintage
ale
in
numbered
bottles
that
cost
8
00
that
sets
that
voice
inside
by
head
to
screaming
gimmick
ive
always
had
suspicions
that
that
voice
is
wrong
a
lot
like
no
sean
dont
drink
that
shot
that
the
stranger
gave
you
or
no
sean
dont
set
that
on
fire
or
no
sean
shaving
your
eyebrows
is
not
a
good
idea
but
now
i
have
the
proof
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
worthy
of
any
special
occasion
like
thursdays
this
ale
pours
a
reddishorange
hue
with
an
excellent
head
that
holds
very
well
leaves
ample
lacing
and
eventually
settles
to
14
inch
collar
the
aroma
is
all
malt
caramel
sweet
and
slightly
candyish
first
taste
is
all
malt
a
little
alcohol
twinge
and
a
tart
finish
a
little
short
in
the
mouthfeel
dry
but
not
very
hoppy
more
of
a
strong
ale
than
a
barleywine
but
good

wow
a
masterpiece
in
a
bottle
aged
to
perfection
and
worth
the

a
bottle
its
flavours
have
peaked
but
may
not
fall
to
a
lesser
beer
even
a
year
or
more
of
cellaring
easy
to
drink
with
very
little
aged
flavour
and
no
signs
of

tastes

from
the
initial
maltiness
to
a
good

taste
slightl
alcohol
hit
and
then
lingering
flavors
of
all
the
above
finally
ending
with
a
good
little
hop
kick
very
tasty
stuff
i
had
the
fortune
to
try
this
immediately
following
the
1999
vintage
we
were
doing
side
by
side
comparisons
this
one
is
so
similar
in
the
uniqueness
of
the
other
vintages
that
it
to
deserves
recognition
again
this
one
sees
a
fins
mixture
and
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
aroma
of
hops
is
refreshing
sharp
and
awake
is
the
feeling
from
the
nose
just
makes
you
smile
this
one
still
needs
some
more
aging
these
peek
at
3
years
in
the
bottle
this
one
was
just
a
tad
bit
rough
barely
but
noticeable
when
compared
the
99
side
by
side
the
balance
is
not
yet
formed
but
is
close
enough
to
still
be
a
wonderful
beer
but
as
a
treasured
beer
i
am
saving
the
last
one
for
next
christmas
the
yeast
smell
is
stronger
with
a
sweet
alcohol
nose
surfacing
just
behind
the
hops
the
malt
is
still
pretty
sweet
and
goes
down
well
too
beautiful
tan
head
on
this
one
and
it
just
lasts
ands
lasts
and
lasts
by
far
the
best
beer
from
fullers
it
poured
a
nice
copper
orangebrown
and
the
foam
was
light
brown
the
smell
had
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
a
hint
of
a
malty
nature
the
taste
was
out
of
this
world
it
had
a
sweet
fruity
flavor
and
the
sweetbitterness
with
the
complex
aroma
and
flavor
just
set
this
ale
into
a
different
world
now
i
can
enjoy
two
of
fullers
strong
ales
the
other
being
fullers
1845
this
is
one
of
my
top
beers
and
i
will
stock
up
on
it
before
my
store
sells
out
i
would
have
compared
this
backtoback
with
fullers
1998
but
i
only
have
one
lone
bottle
of
that
remaining
so
memory
will
have
to
serve
many
of
the
same
appearance
and
aroma
qualities
as
the
1998
the
2000
has
more
ragged
alcohol
edges
and
biting
cinnamon
notes
in
the
malt
the
hops
are
pretty
big
and
orchestrate
a
rougher
close
combined
with
too
much
carbonation
and
in
conjunction
with
the
alcohol
still
a
big
and
beautiful
barleywine
the
next
one
will
get
stored

mellowing

it
would
be
better
with
age
i
just
could
not
wait
a

like
always
bottle
number
64495
the
entire
presentation
is
very
aesthetically
pleasing
from
the
wellappointed
box
to
the
band
across
the
top
of
the
bottle
whats
inside
and
what
really
matters
is
a
pretty
reddishcopper
beer
with
a
big
fluffy
head
carbonation
is
fairly
high
it
has
a
nice
aroma
of
ripe
fruit
with
noticeable
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
musky
smell
the
initial
flavor
is
quite
sweet
but
the
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
an
very
subtle
citrus
flavors
are
detectable
i
havent
tried
any
other
fullers
vintage
and
have
nothing
to
compare
against
but
i
really
like
this
one
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
well
respected
brew
but
it
was
just
too
overly
sticky
for
me
sweet
start
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
port
caramel
and
a
hint
of
berries
bitter

from

to

remains

after
the
experience
is

sinks
down
to

slight

the
first
taste
i
get
is
a
hoppyalcohol
bitternes
but
then
the
malt
kicks
in
with
some
burnt
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
this
is
one
complex
brew
great
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
really
like
this
beer
although
my
experience
with
the
style
is
limited
i
ould
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
kickass
barley
wine
the
taste
is
raisin
rum
slight
oak
pumpernickel
bread
and
dark
cherry
this
definitely
tastes
a
bit
like
a
dubbel
yet
i
still
get
old
ale
complex
and
dangerously
drinkable
this
may
be
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
great
some
good
malt
flavors
but
a
little
too
much
licorice
for
my
liking
however
because
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
of
this
beer
goes
to
charity
specifically
the
wolf
sanctuary
of
pennsylvania
ill
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
it
to
support
that
charity
not
a
very
good
old
ale
more
like
a
strong
amber
ale
with
very
simple
character
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
color
is
very
dark
brownalmost
black
but
when
held
up
to
bright
light
it
shows
a
deep
ruby
cloudy
red
color
deep
tan
head
with
little
lacing
aroma
is
a
blend
of
caramel
chocolate
and
some
spices
like
cloves
i
believe
taste
hits
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
the
malt
comes
through
slightly
over
the
hops
with
good
heavy
caramel
and
a
slight
chocolate
flavor
slight
spice
flavor
in
the
background
without
overpowering
crisp
mouthfeel
well
balanced
and
pretty
smooth
for
a
warmer
with
a
decent
kick
for
me
this
was
the
perfect
example
of
a
winter
warmer
ale
the
taste
is
bold
and
warming
the
subtle
booziness
doesnt
overpower
the
flavor
but
you
can
feel
its
there
the
dark
color
gives
way
to
a
perfect
blend
of
spices
and
smoky
flavors
this
may
be
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
where
the
malts
and
hops
are
well
blended
but
there
is
too
much
alcohol
taste
leaking
through
for
my
liking
but
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
then
give
this
a
try

go

if
its

in

area
most
definitely
the
best
offering
ive
ever
had
from
lancaster
this
is
world
class
for
me
overall
this
is
an
acceptable
beer
when
i
first
tasted
it
i
had
to
pause
because
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
by
the
end
i
decided
it
was
pretty
much
a
miss
its
not
totally
a
lost
cause
but
i
wouldnt
race
back
for
another
one
i
will
say
however
that
i
stepped
outside
about
halfway
through
the
drink
to
have
a
quick
smoke
and
it
was
freezing
out
there
i
came
in
a
couple
minutes
later
and
i
dont
knowmaybe
it
was
the
coldbut
the
beer
tasted
better
to
me
at
least
for
the
first
couple
minutes
after
i
sat
down
a
complex
dessert
beer
d
really
likes
excellent
prost
the
beer
off
the
pour
looks
great
but
the
flavor
profile
is
way
way
too
malty
sweet
no
balance
whatsoever
some
people
might
dig
this
interpretation
of
the
style
but
i
cant
say
that
i
really
do
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
and
i
personally
dont
think
it
fits
to
style
too
sweet
with
not
enough
accent
to
keep
it
interesting
i
suppose
you
could
age
it
to
see
what
happens
a
slow
sipping
winter
warmer
high
alcohol
and
lower
carbonation
make
the
drink
sit
well
and
allow
it
to
warm
the
beer
flavor
is
very
simple
and
spread
very
thin
but
i
appreciate
the
balance
of
spice
sweetness
and
fruit
notes
i
cant
stand
winter
beers
with
spices
and
crap
in
them
this
is
just
a
big
bold
winter
brew
and
i
love
it
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
medium
its
sweet
and
smooth
but
not
as
heavy
as
i
would
think
the
carbonation
is
light
thankfully
and
the
beer
eventually
finishes
a
little
dry
and
peppery
with
faint
hops
its
pretty
much
overly
sweet
and
not
balanced
well
but
that
is
a
description
of
the
style
now
isnt
it
o
the
abv
is
there
for
a
winter
warmer
but
too
wimpy
on
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
for
my
liking
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
12oz
globe
shows
a
dark
brown
to
black
hue
depending
on
the
light
large
amount
of
brown
lacing
when
pour
vigorously
dissipates
quickly
sweet
nectar
smelling
molasses
the
dark
pour
emanates
the
dark
fruit
odor
such
as
candied
raisins
chocolate
and
car
bitter
on
the
tounge
intially
finishes
smooth
with
very
little
aftetaste
slightly
malty
packs
a
punch
at
8
9
abv
this
is
probably
the
best
bottled
beer
ive
had
from
lancaster
and
only
one
of
two
id
recommend
at
all
the
other
is
their
milk
stout
which
is
passable
this
was
a
really
nice
complex
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
a
good
cold
night
by
the
fireplace
beer
this
is
a
pretty
decent
ale
but
it
isnt
all
that
complex
it
is
straightforward
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
o
nice
winter
warmer
i
really
like
the
fruit
character
but
it
didnt
quite
come
all
together
for
me
overall
a
quite
delicious
and
nice
warming
winter
ale
quite
nice
o
be
patient
the
warmer
it
is
the
more
flavorful
it
is
i
learned
this
on
my
last
three
gulps
this
is
a
really
good
beer
sweet
but
it
has
some
balance
high
in
alcohol
but
relatively
unnoticeable
on
a
cold
winter
night
start
a
fire
pour
this
beer
relax
and
take
your
time
with
it
and
think
about
the
wolves
too
o
a
very
nice
brew
i
wish
they
could
hide
the
alcohol
a
bit
better
as
it
would
greatly
improve
the
brew
this
was
a
very
complex
and
robust
old
ale
the
nose
seemed
to
have
a
little
more
burn
to
it
than
the
palate
did
all
i
can
say
is
dont
let
the
harsh
aroma
scare
you
off
with
this
one
because
everything
else
about
the
brew
is
absolutely
wonderful
a
handsome
pour
nice
well
rounded
tight
head
with
great
retention
you
can
smell
cherry
sherry
and
toasty
prune
malts
from
across
the
table
more
flavors
going
on
the
nose
like
a
sweet
belgian
candi
full
tasting
blasting
through
my
taste
buds
with
a
thick
rich
complexity
very
smooth
yet
very
full
mouth
feel
creamy
not
much
bitterness
at
all
not
much
of
a
fan
of
these
so
called
winter
beers
but
damn
this
one
is
good
high
abv
is
hard
to
detect
as
it
is
9
alcohol
the
toasty
cherrynot
cloying
sweetness
remains
well
after
the
beer
is
down
i
dont
know
what
style
this
should
beits
no
old
ale
classified
as
except
the
winter
is
a
great
time
for
it
but
damn
it
belongs
by
your
fireplace
when
it
gets
cold
and
it
is
a
very
rich
flavorful
surprise
i
will
continue
to
buy
best
so
called
winter
warmer
ive
had
since
sam
adams
screwed
up
its
2003
circa
recipe
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
dark
magohney
color
body
with
a
little
bit
of
tan
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
roasted
nut
the
taste
is
roasty
and
malty
up
front
with
kinda
of
a
burnt
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
overall
is
a
good
winter
style
beer
o
a
very
steady
beer
that
is
easly
drinkable
but
wuold
expect
a
more
robust
beer
for
the
style
out
of
a
bottle
this
old
ale
was
a
nearly
opaque
dark
mahogany
color
with
one
finger
of
khakicolored
head
the
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
as
a
delicate
sliding
curtain
the
aroma
was
rich
and
malty
with
notes
of
raisin
bread
vanilla
caramel
light
booze
and
dark
fruits
the
flavors
were
not
quite
as
well
balanced
as
the
aroma
however
i
tasted
the
sweet
dark
malt
first
and
the
prunesdates
followed
by
a
note
of
wood
and
some
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
the
nearly
9
alc
was
wellhidden
the
finish
lingered
on
my
palate
but
wasnt
quite
bitterhoppy
enough
to
counteract
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
semicreamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
delicate
this
is
pretty
heavyduty
for
a
winter
warmer
good
flavor
and
acts
the
part
of
its
namesake
worth
a
whirl
edit
after
looking
at
the
profile
of
this
beer
i
see
that
it
is
in
fact
an
old
ale
it
also
does
a
reasonably
good
job
of
hiding
the
abv
poured
out
as
a
deep
red
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
minimal
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
spicy
notes
and
a
sweet
malty
aroma
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
caramel
flavor
followed
up
by
somw
of
the
warming
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
feeling
and
had
a
medium
body
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
id
try
it
again
if
i
say
it
on
a
menu
somewhere
overall
a
solid
winter
offering
from
lancaster
well
rounded
flavors
spice
is
used
appropriately
and
suited
to
warm
the
insides
during
the
coldest
part
of
the
year
taste
is
malty
to
say
the
least
malts
are
heavy
and
sweet
lots
of
molasses
and
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
but
is
also
quite
smooth
and
sticky
with
a
soft
alcohol
finish
overall
pretty
desent
sweetness
and
alcohol
rule
this
beer
overall
i
went
to
school
out
in
lancaster
and
used
to
drink
this
on
tap
years
back
with
not
much
of
a
refined
palate
i
have
to
admit
i
am
not
a
big
lbc
fan
at
all
revisiting
this
one
years
later
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
pretty
impressed
very
tasty
drinkable
beer
that
is
great
on
this
cold
rainy
december
night
o
i
call
this
one
a
tie
both
were
solid
old
ales
o
not
a
standout
beer
but
i
will
admit
that
i
am
not
a
fancier
of
winter
ales
and
winter
warmers
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
didnt
suck
lbc
makes
some
respectable
beers
and
this
was
overall
a
solid
effort
overall
for
such
a
high
abv
little
alcohol
is
perceived
making
this
a
drink
to
be
repected
im
nearly
clueless
on
the
style
but
i
would
recommend
this
one
very
tasty
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
that
had
no
retention
there
is
both
sweet
and
sour
in
the
nose
the
upfront
flavor
is
malt
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
booziness
not
anything
unpleasant
at
all
the
finish
is
bitter
also
with
a
lingering
alcohol
presence
not
bad
for
a
late
night
sipper
when
you
have
overdone
it
a
bit
with
the
thanksgiving
leftovers
overall
a
good
try
from
lbc
taste
is
sweet
candy
fruits
roasted
maltssweet
breads
spices
and
a
very
nice
alcohol
hit
and
a
small
citrus
hop
bitterness
and
a
very
nice
crisp
ending
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
give
it
an
overall
rating
of
4
0
give
this
delightful
winter
ale
a
try
i
sure
enjoyed
it
thanks
to
epps
beverage
for
this
sample
doverall
this
realyl
didnt
do
it
for
me
old
ale
isnt
my
fav
style
but
i
def
have
beers
i
like
from
this
style
this
just
wasnt
complex
enough
for
me
and
didnt
have
a
very
good
after
taste
very
good
the
first
old
ale
ive
had
so
i
cant
compare
with
others
in
the
style
but
a
solid
nice
brew
to
kick
back
with
head
dissolves
to
nothing
but
i
assume
that
is
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
coming
in
at
just
about
9
percent
it
smells
really
roasty
with
some
chocolate
malts
and
some
plumdark
fruit
like
smells
with
a
slight
earthyfruity
hop
smell
taste
is
very
rich
and
sweet
with
the
bite
in
the
beginning
and
the
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
tastes
come
together
the
sweetness
is
in
the
middle
ending
with
a
dry
slight
earthy
and
very
slight
citrus
hop
taste
mixing
with
the
dry
yeast
a
slight
alcohol
taste
the
only
thing
that
brings
this
beer
down
is
the
alcohol
isnt
that
well
masked
but
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
little
from
winter
brew
tasting

that
fell
to
a

nose
with

the

a

clingy
on

up

not
bad

it
could
be
a

dit
actually
goes
down
real
easily
and
quickly
for
the
abv
actually
this
is
one
of
the
better
old
ales
ive
had
it
really
does
taste
like
a
barley
wine
that
is
much
easier
to
drink
go
out
and
get
this
one
do
it
for
the
wolves
d
not
very
sessionable
given
the
higher
abv
but
smooth
for
the

reminds
me
a
lot
of

and
perfect
for

my
first
taste
of
anything
cc
a
very
interesting
brew
very
woody

rough

with
nearly
two
years

it

superior
in

to
the

appears
to
have

this

the

with

wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
wood
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
solid
but
slightly
boring
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
overall
so
anyway
theres
a
lot
of
wood
in
here
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
bit
overthetop
there
also
appears
to
be
a
touch
of
staling
or
oxidation
which
i
assume
is
intentional
since
this
beer
just
came
out
not
too
long
ago
and
i
bought
it
cold
maybe
theres
a
good
beer
in
there
but
behind
the
light
staling
and
the
heavyhanded
oak
its
tough
to
tell
overall
a
disappointment

an

up

where
it

does
it
shed

sense
of
drinkability
as
do
those
either
but
it
trends
american
barleywine
but
with
olde
ale
and
old
fashion
influence
overall
its
an
above
average
beer
its
tasty
and
enjoyable
at
times
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
unfortunately
for
me
its
a
big
malt
bomb
after
half
a
glass
i
get
bored
of
the
flavor
o
a
good
rperesentation
of
a
old
ale
which
really
pushes
the
limits
on
calling
this
an
old
ale
since
the
abv
is
a
measure
higher
and
old
ales
should
not
or
typically
would
not
have
been
aged
on
american
oak
this
should
really
be
classified
as
a
specialtywood
aged
beer
overall
a
good
beer
but
one
that
ultimately
disappoints
its
branding
promises
a
roaring
20s
prohibitionlike
atmosphere
that
cant
exist
without
some
obvious
presence
of
alcohol
which
is
also
a
hallmark
characteristic
of
the
old
ale
style
i
feel
that
the
absence
of
this
quality
is
a
fault
that
detracts
from
the
enjoyability
of
this
beer
as
well
as
the
celebration
of
its
history
o
a
little
weak
imo
quite
bourbonesque
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
for
it
tried
this
side
by
side
with
the
other
two
gentlemens
club
beers
the
bier
stein
had
on
offer
and
found
very
little
diference
between
any
of
them
all
of
them
were
dominated
by
a
considerable
amount
of
sweet
malt
and
vanilla
if
anything
this
particular
version
was
even
maltier
than
the
bourbon
and
rye
whiskey
versions
i
sampled
with
more
of
a
vanilla
presence
once
again
though
the
difference
was
pretty
subtle
my
feeling
is
that
if
youve
tried
one
gentlemans
club
old
ale
beer
youve
pretty
much
tried
them
all
needless
to
say
im
kicking
myself
for
deciding
i
needed
to
try
all
three
of
versions
that
were
on
tap
at
the
bier
stein
o
overall
this
was
by
far
the
best
variation
to
me
this
one
had
a
very
similar
mouthfeel
to
the
rye
version
a
slightly
better
taste
and
a
much
better
nose
tons
of
caramel
malts
and
toffee
and
much
less
fruit
this
one
also
seemed
to
have
a
little
whiskey
to
it
worth
getting
especially
if
you
are
only
getting
one
of
them
recommendation
this
one
is
probably
for
only
the
diehard
locals
and
shorts
fans
average
beer
drinkers
can
find
better
versions
out
there
im
sure
but
dont
pass
on
bourbon
aphasia

youve

the

really
open
up
once
it
warms
another
winner
from
shorts
hrmm
not
really
what
i
would
consider
a
good
old
ale
imo
the
roast
character
is
totally
out
of
place
here
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
without
being
overly
sweet
or
overly
boozy
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
not
too
crisp
a
little
creamy
slightly
sticky
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
think
two
would
be
my
limit
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
during
a
cold
night
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
appearance
and
drinkability
they
were
all
very
nice
and
to
me
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
i
wish
it
was
much
more
balanced
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
sold
out
pretty
quickly
around
here
but
if
shorts
makes
it
again
this
year
i
would
try
to
get
a
couple
six
pack
and
i
have
a
couple
to
age
so
i
can
see
how
it
changes
over
time
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
old
ales
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
i
think
its
worth
a
try
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
and
i
think
it
makes
for
a
nice
wintertime
beer
especially
during
this
cold
weather
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
shorts
beers
and
i
think
its
a
good
and
true
to
style
example
of
the
style
great
job
guys
this
is
one
tasty
old
ale
keep
up
the
hard
work
o
a
pretty
decent
old
ale
the
bourbon
barrel
version
is
far
superior
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
at
first
but
sipping
on
it
as
it
warmed
up
lead
me
to
giving
it
straight
4s
as
is
the
case
with
most
beers
the
bbad
version
of
aphasia
is
better
than
the
regular
the
thing
is
this
is
much
cheaper
and
still
very
enjoyable
surprise
surprise
another
great
one
from
shorts
just
not
that
impressed
needs
refinement
oshorts
isnt
known
yet
for
their
barrel
program
but
what
a
treat
ive
had
several
bbl
shorts
beers
and
look
for
them
to
really
build
on
their
output
in
the
coming
years
nice
bourbon
barrel
schwarz
but
without
the
punch
youd
expect
from
a
bourbon
barreled
beer
nutty
same
essence
no
bite
taste
is
equally
smooth
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
dangerous
to
be
around
too
much
of
it
o
probably
the
best
beer
i
had
on
my
12brewery
loop
trip
through
upper
michigan
