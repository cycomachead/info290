down
smell

taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
yeast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
classy
beer
reminded
me
of
belgian
strong
ales
i
would
have
liked
less
sweet
i
also
found
deus
overly
sweet
as
it
warmed
up
sincerely
it
is
not
much
behind
deus
and
luckily
or
evolution
this
one
was
even
more
rounded
up
nevertheless
this
is
not
my
preferred
style
i
couldnt
help
to
compared
them
to
apple
ciders
which
i
am
not
fond
of
and
sometimes
i
liked
to
be
polemic
but
this
is
perfect
for
desserts
a
bit
expensive
for
this
reason
in
my
opinion
unless
you
dig
sugar
highs
suggestion
drink
it
close
to
expiration
date
it
worked
well
for
me
only
my
second
biere
de
champange
but
this
is
by
far
the
better
of
the
two
o
great
drinkability
one
of
the
best
brazilian
beers
ive
ever
had
this
bottle

unexceptional
courtesy
of
ralph
who
shared
d
a
miss
for
me
but
i
need
to
explore
this
style
more
the
fruity
esters
and
the
smokiness
were
interesting
but
totally
off
style
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
i
am
glad
we
split
the
bottle
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
for
the
price
md
this
beer
was
very
similar
to
a
champagne
but
there
was
a
lot
going
on
tons
of
carbonation
this
beer
changed
a
lot
through
the
drink
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
overall
could
be
worse
but
was
pretty
off
watch
out
for
this
one
da
little
rough
on
the
palate
with
the
huge
carbonation
and
extremely
grainy
feel
the
flavors
are
interesting
not
bad
but
they
dont
seem
to
mesh
that
well
together
unique
complex
sweet
and
dry
fruity
and
spicy
notes
of
honey
and
smokey
peat
peaty
earthiness
is
slightly
reminiscent
of
mushrooms
in
a
good
way
if
you
can
say
that
for
a
premium
beer
warming
alcohol
sparkly
bubbly
carbonation
i
finally
decided
to
crack
this
baby
in
rememberance
of
a
good
mateit
pours
a
nice
deep
orangeamber
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
with
average
lacing
here
and
therethe
aroma
is
definately
a
cross
of
champagne
and
beer
with
some
sweet
malty
undertones
and
to
be
honest
i
like
this
aroma
its
definately
a
first
for
meit
has
a
nice
weighty
mouthfeel
compared
to
the
usual
light
mouthfeel
of
a
fine
champagne
and
this
really
keeps
me
interested
as
obviously
a
nice
champagne
would
not
have
a
full
mouthfeel
so
i
really
feel
the
beer
takes
over
in
this
brew
and
it
is
a
sensational
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
if
it
wasnt
so
expensiveif
you
see
this
brew
and
have
never
tried
it
you
should
definately
give
it
a
go
cheers
this
beer
pours
into
a
wine
glass
with
a
dark
amber
color
and
a
very
white
very
fast
head
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
the
cork
blew
off
like
a
champagne
bottle
hard
and
all
the
way
across
the
room
the
smell
is
similar
to
wine
but
not
too
overpoweringly
sour
the
taste
is
dry
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
obviously
with
the
high
carbonation
the
beer
sort
of
bubbles
across
the
tongue
then
finishes
with
an
easy
and
sweet
aftertaste
somewhat
similar
in
flavor
to
a
lambic
but
without
the
extreme
sour
aspect
that
many
have
absolutely
a
different
beer
and
one
worth
trying
but
not
sure
that
i
would
be
getting
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
as
its
more
like
champagne
then
beer
and
runs
about
25
a
bottle
check
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
note
the
processes
of
remuage
and
dégorgement
are
suppose
to
remove
yeast
from
the
bottle
so
it
is
more
likely
that
what
im
observing
are
actually
coagulated
proteins
this
is
a
rare
style
i
believe
there
are
only
three
of
these
around
the
world
that
are
available
i
found
this
to
be
quite
a
treat
and
would
heartily
recommend
you
try
it
or
one
of
the
other
champagne
style
beers
just
for
the
experience
i
see
this
as
going
over
very
well
in
mixed
company
either
before
or
after
dinner
and
quite
a
conversation
piece
after
all
what
is
life
all
about
edit
holy
crap

i
would
certainly
not
pegged
it
that
high
this
beer
poured
a
clear
light
ambergolden
color
with
slightly
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
a
while
but
settled
and
coated
the
glass
as
the
beer
was
consumed
the
smell
was
lightly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
corn
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
with
some
alcohol
there
were
flavors
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
corn
dms
and
very
mild
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
airy
with
mediumlight
body
and
strong
carbonation
overall
lightly
sweet
this
was
ok
but
not
exciting
though
it
did
grown
on
me
after
a
little
while
cork
date
on
this
one
is
2006
tried
to
fly
out
of
the
bottle
after
i
popped
the
cork
as
gently
as
i
could
and
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
12
head
of
streaming
bubbles
very
much
like
a
hearty
champagne
in
appearance
the
aroma
is
very
clean
almost
like
a
lager
with
a
touch
of
caramel
some
oak
apples
and
raw
sugar
flavors
are
more
aggressive
heavy
carbonation
up
front
with
candied
pears
honey
some
alcohol
presence
and
a
light
pleasant
tartness
with
a
dry
finish
profile
is
similar
to
a
beefier
version
of
duvel
and
either
would
make
a
fine
substitute
for
a
young
champagne
d
intruiging
best
split
with
friends
lovely
pop
when
i
launched
the
cork
off
of
my
balcony
a
slow
yet
consant
plume
of
foam
slowly
makes
its
way
out
of
the
bottle
after
the
corked
i
popped
after
about
five
minutes
the
foam
backs
off
the
pour
into
our
champagne
glasses
showcases
the
brisk
white
head
that
almost
overflows
the
glass
greeted
with
an
almost
a
peachy
amber
with
highlights
of
gold
and
straw
mingling
with
the
beautiful
bubbling
the
aroma
has
a
soft
pilsner
like
quality
with
much
more
attenton
focused
on
very
light
fruits
and
just
a
balancing
note
of
hops
the
first
sip
blesses
the
palate
with
dry
malty
fruits
a
little
yeast
some
honey
and
herbal
grassy
hops
finish
the
ansemble
the
palate
has
a
great
carbonation
that
develops
all
the
flavors
of
this
beer
nicley
but
a
lasting
snd
bitter
aftertaste
makes
the
palat
of
this
beer
a
little
less
than
what
it
could
of
been
great
sipping
beer
well
be
having
more
of
this
through
the
years
to
remind
us
of
this
day
and
i
wont
be
disappointed
when
we
do
but
i
wish
this
had
some
more
characteristics
of
a
brut
champagne
more
dryness
and
a
lighter
body
specifically
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
lust
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
justify
the
25
price
tag
either
your
call
drinkability
this
would
be
proper
to
have
at
any
elegant
celebration
a
cool
entry
for
a
beer
tasting
dont
know
how
it
would
age
the
abv
would
certainly
preserve
it
a
while
id
love
to
have
this
again
and
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
drinkability
i
actually
had
to
ramp
this
one
up
alcohol
is
not
warming
and
quickly
calls
for
more
without
causing
too
much
intoxication
this
is
one
special
beer
right
here
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
lot
of
little
floaties
moving
around
in
there
big
head
falls
fast
just
as
champagne
would
nose
is
kind
of
sappy
hop
like
flavor
is
tart
and
tangy
seems
a
bit
rough
on
the
edge
minor
yeast
tone
strong
sugar
tone
but
not
in
a
way
that
i
feel
like
it
blends
at
all
it
seems
to
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
the
carbonation
at
first
seemed
so
biting
that
it
was
almost
enough
for
me
to
just
quit
drinking
the
whole
thing
it
calms
down
a
good
bit
but
then
the
liquid
feels
a
bit
too
syrupy
overall
this
is
a
soso
brew
in
comparison
to
the
two
others
of
the
style
i
have
had
before
deus
still
reigns
supreme
this
doesnt
really
come
close
at
all
and
takes
its
place
next
to
krait
a
waste
of
money
and
way
too
much
of
it
imo
try
the
deus
instead
as
the
beer
warms
up
from
its
initial
50f
10c
it
picks
up
some
subtle
touches
of
woodiness
or
even
plasticized
though
not
in
a
bad
way
leather
character
in
the
finish
the
malt
character
picks
up
a
bit
and
the
sweetness
gets
a
bit
more
tempered
as
the
beer
warms
too
a
lot
of
this
tempering
manifests
itself
in
the
form
of
a
salty
peatlike
smokiness
that
is
just
barely
perceptible
at
times
but
definitely
present
though
i
am
not
implying
that
any
peat
malt
was
used
though
you
never
know
this
could
definitely
be
a
bit
drier
and
a
bit
spicier
funky
this
would
evoke
the
champagnelike
character
quite
a
bit
more
still
it
is
quite
tasty
and
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
while
this
does
have
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
character
it
manages
to
hide
the
11
5
alcohol
quite
well
this
is
definitely
best
enjoyed
on
the
warmer
side
of
things
the
suggested
serving
temperatures
would
definitely
have
ruined
this
beer
for
me
in
the
end
this
is
quite
enjoyable
but
it
really
could
be
so
much
more
complex
and
interesting
drinkability
not
a
easytodrink
beer
with
its
115
abv
maybe
one
bottle
750ml
its
ok
but
sure
ill
drink
another
some
day
i
really
dont
know
how
to
describe
this
it
was
certainly
good
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
i
am
at
a
real
loss
to
compare
to
anything
in
that
its
truly
a
unique
entity
i
do
feel
confident
that
if
you
enjoy
asti
spumante
you
would
definitely
like
this
for
the
sweetness
i
can
honestly
say
the
best
biere
de
champagne
ive
ever
tasted
if
you
like
a
dry
sweet
beer
with
a
nice
kick
of
carbonation
or
have
a
significant
other
that
does
not
like
beer
or
simply
enjoy
a
change
of
scenery
and
like
trying
new
beer
styles
check
this
out
wow
just
wow
eisenbahn
lust
prestige
kicks
the
shit
out
of
deus
and
its
well
worth
trying
at
least
once
however
youll
need
to
come
to
brazil
to
purchase
a
bottle
for
yourself
and
if
you
can
find
it
youll
be
spending
at
least
r80
or
us
50
for
a
bottle
d
this
is
delicious
and
very
easy
to
drink
after
having
deus
in
the
past
and
now
this
im
very
anxious
to
try
more
of
this
style
just
wish
they
werent
so
expensive
a
great
brew
shows
a
touch
of
heat
and
a
touch
of
class
but
be
prepared
to
dish
out
the
d
could
use
more
spritz
and
dryness
for
the
style
but
good
if
you
take
it
as
a
malt
liquor
still
its
overpriced
at
11
99
relative
to
some
superior
offerings
that
are
available
for
a
tenth
of
the
price
o
very
strange
example
of
the
style
as
there
is
so
little
carbonation
which
is
not
what
i
have
observed
with
others
in
the
style
or
would
have
expected
not
super
easy
to
drink
due
the
sweetness
definitely
not
sessionable
for
me
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
o
this
is
a
very
unusual
bière
de
champagne
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
very
carbonated
its
not
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
imo
its
better
than
infinium
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
either
this
came
off
a
little
too
sweet
and
somewhat
malt
liquer
like
the
beer
is
really
a
strong
lager
in
taste
and
feel
i
like
it
and
for
the
price
is
good
value
not
sure
it
is
in
the
correct
style
cat
but
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
is
a
decent
beer
though
perhaps
not
worth
the
price
edit
wow
first
review
for
the
style
would
pass
on
it
in
the
future
well
this
is
a
singularly
underwhelming
beer
the
bottle
says
brewed
in
belgium
v
the
polish
version
listed
here
poured
with
an
ok
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
straw
yellow
color
with
the
full
head
picked
up
a
pleasant
fleeting
aroma
gone
now
friends
didnt
pick
it
up
flavor
is
basically
sweet
and
thats
it
body
and
carbonation
is
ok
finsih
is
uh
yeah
forgettable
beer
the
bottle
i
purchased
listed
palm
breweries
in
steenhuffel
belgium
as
the
brewer
and
not
cobra
there
is
the
sweet
lager
yeast
aroma
of
bread
and
typical
european
maltiness
the
color
is
pale
golden
the
mouthfeel
has
more
body
than
i
expected
for
a
lager
and
is
about
medium
in
feel
the
taste
is
of
malt
and
carbonation
you
can
see
the
bubbles
in
the
glass
like
champagne
the
finsh
is
a
little
syrupy
and
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
as
the
beer
goes
down
it
does
do
a
great
job

this

well
its
definitely
a

but
i
wonder
if
its
worth
all
the
methode
champagnoise
effort
if
this
were
just
any
belgian
pils
or
belgian
golden
not
bad
but
for
all
the
hoopla
it
disappoints
jmo
this
may
not
be
worldclass
beer
but
im
still
having
a
hell
of
time
sipping
my
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
if
bang
for
the
buck
is
important
to
you
krait
prestige
awaits
a
home
in
your
glass
just
try
not
to
think
of
it
as
king
cobra
flavor
is
malty
and
some
light
fruit
hints
but
mostly
clean
lager
malt
hits
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
not
overly
complex
and
no
hints
of
abv
on
the
drinking
part
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
no
flaws
just
didnt
really
excite
me
too
much
not
worth
pursuing
but
worthy
of
a
dram
if
you
come
across
it
a
nice
lager
with
more
flavors
than
most
but
for
me
one
is
enough
just
not
my
style
of
beer
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
with
champagnestyle
carbonation

nice

d
the
result
of
this
champagnelager
is
a
premium
version
of
budweiser
nothing
more
this
was
interesting
but
not
worth
the
what
this
beer
lacks
in
complexities
and
allaround
unique
ﬂavor
it
makes
up
for
with
originality
though
that
originality
might
be
more
in
the
marketing
and
packaging
than
the
actual
beer
kp
being
brewed
at
the
same
brewery
as
rodenbach
does
not
change
the
fact
that
this
beer
tastes
like
a
malt
liquor
sure
a
little
bit
more
reﬁned
and
clean
but
packaging
alone
wont
put
more

little
for

some
on

how
about
a

drinkability
this
wasnt
as
good
as
i
expected
for
one
of
the
top
rated
bière
bruts
this
has
aged
gracefully
and
though
i
think
i
preferred
it
fresh
this
has
its
own
intriguing
set
of
nuances
that
makes
it
special
much
like
champagne
picks
up
truffle
earth
mineral
qualities
as
it
cellars
this
seems
to
go
the
same
route
thanks
to
a
substantial
malt
base
and
brett
yeast
presence
o
4
5
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
not
particularly
sour
or
funky
but
those
characteristics
go
well
with
the
barrel
and
hops
o
another
awesome
belgianstyle
ale
from
mikkeller
i
cannot
recommend
this
one
highly
enough
ogreat
balance
and
easy
drinking
unique
combination
of
flavors
taste
follows
te
nose
slight
white
wine
tartness
and
a
little
but
of
funk
dry
finish
with
a
very
light
malt
sweetness
the
use
of
wild
yeasts
nelson
sauvin
hops
and
sauvignon
blanc
barrel
aging
really
turned
this
belgian
ale
into
a
spectacularly
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
this
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
offerings
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
from
mikkeller
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
in
order
to
enjoy
all
that
hoppy
goodness
o
another
bretttastic
beer
from
mikkel
not
as
amazing
as
i
was
expecting
but
certainly
enjoyable
to
the
point
of
seeking
out
again
o
well
it
lives
up
to
the
name
if
you
like
sauvignon
blanc
wine
you
will
like
this
im
not
a
fan
of
dry
white
wines
so
this
was
a
bit
much
for
me
not
much
to
discern
from
the
base
beer
as
the
barrel
dominates
here
both
from
a
wine
and
from
a
drying
oak
perspective
overall
really
interesting
complex
and
tasty
beer
its
one
drawback
is
that
at
times
the
flavors
seem
to
clash
rather
than
compliment
one
another
only
unlike
the
grotesquely
delicious
and
uncannily
loyal
dogturkey
this
is
champales
good
parts
dont
offset
one
another
like
some
kind
of
abomination
of
god
they
instead
accentuate
one
another
and
the
result
is
like
one
of
the
most
intense
and
refreshing
saisons
youve
ever
drank
overall
really
good
beer
it
may
have
been
a
mistake
to
get
the
highest
rated
beer
in
the
style
for
my
first
try
of
said
style
but
i
dont
care
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
however
i
do
not
think
i
would
repurchase
maybe
on
a
special
occasion
the
22
bucks
is
just
too
much
however
it
is
pretty
much
a
world
class
beer
overall
very
good
and
would
buy
it
again
this
one
sounded
very
interesting
so
against
my
better
judgment
i
dropped
24
on
a
bottle
dumb
appearance
is
dark
orange
with
a
filmy
head
and
lacing
up
the
sides
of
the
wine
glass
seemed
appropriate
aroma
is
brett
wine
grapes
alcohol
slight
bit
of
rubber
medicine
vicks
vapo
rub
robitussin
flavor
is
brett
wine
alcohol
and
sort
of
this
abrasiveness
that
i
cant
place
this
feels
like
a
ghetto
version
of
russian
river
temptation
nowhere
near
as
good
and
just
sort
of
harsh
this
may
be
my
last
mikkeller
beer
they
arent
very
good
and
the
prices
are
ridiculous
i
love
the
wine
influence
the
brettanomyces
and
the
tobacco
notes
that
the
ale
generates
surprisingly
the
medicinal
notes
that
ensue
dont
detract
from
the
taste
as
much
as
i
would
have
expected
the
ale
is
quite
masterful
even
in
its
flaws
o
i
thought
that
the
brett
and
white
wine
barrel
aging
make
this
beer
interesting
and
a
lot
easier
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
o
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
the
notes
of
brett
take
the
biere
de
champagne
to
the
next
level
i
really
found
this
beer
to
have
a
great
aroma
and
taste
wonderful
i
would
gladly
celebrate
any
number
of
special
occasions
with
this
beer
othe
vinous
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
really
enjoyable
it
is
complex
nicely
balanced
with
wellintegrated
fruit
sweetness
and
alcohol
perhaps
the
mouthfeel
and
flavors
are
not
entirely
in
line
with
other
bieres
de
champagne
but
i
found
this
one
really
enjoyable
relatively
speaking
the
smell
is
a
little
weak
and
it
is
a
pricey
brew
but
i
would
happily
pay
to
drink
this
again
this
is
one
of
those
white
whales
for
me
something
ive
been
hunting
for
forever
and
finally
acquired
much
anticipation
here
it
pours
an
orangey
hued
light
bronze
color
into
my
flute
with
some
aspects
of
the
champagne
style
carbonation
rapidly
rising
bubbles
and
a
hard
to
control
white
head
but
its
not
quite
as
excited
as
i
expected
it
to
be
and
it
does
settle
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
really
complex
and
different
funky
yeast
chardonnay
or
some
other
fairly
standard
white
wine
citrus
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
yeast
strain
that
is
unfamiliar
to
me
the
taste
is
refreshingly
hoppy
the
nelson
sauvin
variety
offers
a
lot
of
fruity
characters
some
tropical
some
citrus
all
delicious
its
cool
because
while
it
does
provide
all
that
fruit
it
retains
a
high
degree
of
bitterness
a
testament
to
the
hops
versatility
and
to
mikkellers
talent
as
a
brewer
the
yeast
has
some
funk
to
it
and
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
lemony
a
lot
more
wine
shows
up
from
the
barrel
treatment
that
expected
and
pushes
the
flavor
more
towards
a
5050
hybrid
than
anything
else
maybe
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
nose
but
its
definitely
got
a
lot
going
on
wholly
unique
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lacking
for
me
a
biere
brut
needs
to
have
nuclear
carbonation
throughout
and
this
one
doesnt
it
starts
pretty
high
but
it
fizzles
out
before
my
glass
is
gone
the
body
is
nice
though
medium
and
smooth
punctuated
by
flashes
of
bubbles
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
creation
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
but
its
really
a
remarkable
brew

joel
the

made
me
expect
more
and
as
this
beer
touts
nelson
sauvin
hops
i
was
hoping
for
a
strong
nelson
hop
presence
which
i
also
didnt
get
but
perhaps
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
added
to
the
fruity
flavor
only
speculating
a
nice
mediumsourness
beer
but
its
not
complex
enough
to
warrant
its
rating
my
opinion
o
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
now
im
looking
for
it
again
this
biere
shines
as
a
flavorful
drinkable
hybrid
nice
d
excellent
balance
the
hops
and
the
barrel
character
blend
very
well
overall
this
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
at
first
its
a
brett
bomb
but
it
really
comes
together
as
an
excellent
beer
overall
very
nice
certainly
not
the
juggernaut
that
charlevoix
s
brut
is
but
a
nice
beer
and
am
happy
to
have
had
it
bottle
poured
a
bright
cloudy
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
dirty
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good

with

yeast
and
light
dry

notes
is
very
intriguing
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
vinous
notes
with
grassy
notes
and
some
funky
ester
with
what
seems
like
brett
notes
extremely
complex
and
somewhat
hard
to
do
justice
of
the
taste
with
my
descriptions
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent

i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
in

i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
pricey
at
19
99
a
bottle
but
i
think
its
definitely
worth
trying
even
at
that
price
o
damn
this
is
truly
amazing
highly
recommended
utterly
worth
the
obscene
price
tag
and
an
exemplar
for
where
the
the

be

just
a

through
more
bretty
flavour
dry

notes
malt
sweetness
and
the
nelson

is
much
more
pronounced
fruity
and
melony
a
bit
funky
with
a
bit
of
lemon
really
fantastic
sweet
on
the
palate
moderate
effervescence
my
first
brut
and
although
im
not
sure
if
this
type
of
flavour
is
characteristic
of
the
style
im
sold
great
complexity
flavor
is
definitely
influenced
by
grapes
as
well
as
it
gives
a
noticeable
sweetness
with
a
grape
kind
of
sugar
thing
going
on
there
was
a
wild
yeast
used
on
this
right
because
i
am
getting
something
mildly
wild
on
here
and
i
say
mildly
because
it
is
so
well
mixed
up
with
all
of
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
i
really
wish
mikkeller
would
make
more
beers
like
this
if
he
had
earlier
on
in
his
career
hed
be
selling
a
lot
more
beers
now
well
not
a
bad
beer
from
mikkeller
as
is
the
general
trend
but
this
is
no
brut
ba
a
bangup
bspa
sure
why
not
however
im
quite
glad
that
i
didnt
break
out
the
stemware
for
this
one
the
standard
pint
glass
or
pickyourtrappist
branded
chalice
will
do
this
is
just
too
brutal
in
a
good
way
but
not
for
the
style
so
drink
it
for
that
reason
and
not
the
intended
one
me
ill
be
sticking
to
the
veritable
french
grapebased
stuff
when
i
get
married
next
week
glad
i
got
this
one
out
of
the
way
first
overall
it
seems
to
me
that
there
were
a
lot
fo
places
this
beer
could
have
gone
wrong
but
didnt
it
walks
the
fine
line
between
a
mess
and
excellence
that
a
lot
of
the
better
examples
of
this
type
of
beer
do
must
try
for
fans
our
sours
pours
a
hazy
deep
orangeish
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
tart
grapes
and
a
small
yeast
presence
in
the
the
taste
tart
yeast
tart
fruit
of
white
grape
and
peaches
and
a
note
of
small
alcohol
a
small
tart
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
a
small
dry
tart
grape
in
the
aftertaste
like
a
very
nice
white
wine
beautiful
tartness
id
say
this
is
more
of
a
soupedup
belgian
ipa
than
anything
else
however
it
still
slips
through
the
cracks
when
it
comes
to
pinning
down
any
one
type
of
style
the
sour
beer
folks
will
get
their
rocks
off
over
this
one
yet
what
sold
me
was
how
the
nelson
sauvignon
hops
held
their
own
up
with
the
brett
and
how
well
the
two
complimented
one
another
so
well
once
is
more
than
enough
for
a
go
around
with
this
stuff
though
something
different
and
something
good
a
very
unique
beer
from
mikkeller
interesting
version
of
a
barrel
and
if
you
like
brett
you
will
like
this
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
2
inch
puffy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
an
island
of
foam
foamy
chunks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
fruit
grapes
apples
white
wine
and
a
sourfunky
aroma
from
the
brett
taste
is
funky
and
bitter
right
off
the
bat
with
some
grapelike
fruit
flavors
coming
through
on
the
finish
there
is
also
a
dry
woody
quality
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
very
bubbly
carbonation
which
i
assume
is
a
direct
result
of
the
champagne
yeast
used
in
this
one
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
my
first
of
the
style
but
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
so
funky
and
bitter
in
taste
based
on
the
aromas
this
beer
poured
a
light
bodied
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
soapy
cream
colored
head
it
smells
of
100
brett
it
has
plenty
of
champagne
yeast
it
tastes
dry
and
tart
their
is
plenty
of
brett
and
wild
yeasts
its
dry
and
funky
its
not
overly
complex
either
it
drinks
light
and
fizzy
plenty
of
carbonation
its
ok
its
weird
that
this
review
is
this
short
but
there
wasnt
too
much
to
say
it
was
solid
but
not
worth
the
money

with
a
nice
balance
of
wine
barrel
funky
brett
and
light
fruit
a
decent
amount
of
musty
funk
from
the
brett
but
it
isnt
as
strong
as
i
expected
the
wine
barrel
flavor
is
very
strong
with
some
dry
toasted
oak
and
sweet
vinous
fruit
the
dryness
of
the
oak
goes
very
nicely
with
the
dry
brett
theres
a
subtle
bready
yeast
character
that
adds
another
dimension
to
the
palate
pretty
sweet
from
the
wine
and
faint
heat
toward
the
finish
abv
is
well
masked
however
making
this
complex
well
balanced
beer
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
mikkeller
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
o
decent
and
wellbalanced
overall
im
pretty
stoked
on
this
juicepoisonlike
beer
its
really
intense
and
fully
earns
its
place
in
the
mikkeller
beerography
would
i
buy
it
again
its
expensive
o
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
since
there
were
only
two
left
at
the
store
and
im
thoroughly
pleased
tart
yet
delicate
jd
its
a
great
beer
with
complex
fruity
flavors
and
the
barrel
treatment
complements
it
nicely
pricey
but
worth
a
try
this
is
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
definitely
worth
the
try
if
youre
feeling
wild
o
an
impressive
offering
from
mikkeller
plenty
of
flavour
in
this
one
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
the
winners
effervescent
mildly
grassy
vegetal
hop
presence
with
an
underlying
citrus
sense
flavors
are
light
and
dance
finish
is
mildly
dry
decent
beer
overall
id
have
it
again
the
palate
has
a
gentle
acidity
big
vinous
flavors
and
juicy
fruity
leathery
brett
notes
pineapple
white

light
earthines
a
lot
of
depth
here
alcohol
is
well
hidden
brett
lingers
in
the
finish
which
is
quite
earthy
and
leathery
slightly
chalky
really
nice
stuff
one
of
the
better
mikkeller
beers
ive
tried
pours
a
clear
light
orange
color
with
a
good
white
head
moderate
amount
of
white
lacing
nose
carries
light
white
wine
plus
some
funk
a
bit
earthy
with
mild
funk
light
acidity
comes
through
in
the
flavor
light
body
with
effervescent
carbonation
really
quite
good
probably
my
favorite
mikkeller
beer
to
date
the
beer
is
a
honey
orange
color
and
has
a
thick
fizzy
white
head
lasting
retention
and
the
tulip
glass
is
coated
with
lacing
the
aroma
brings
floral
and
vegetable
notes
reminiscent
of
cantillon
mamouche
green
peppers
plants
very
vegetal
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
hops
emerge
in
the
finish
complex
and
intriguing
this
is
enjoyable
in
small
quantities
dr
drinkable
but
largely
unremarkable
and
disappointing
considering
the
brewery
and
white
wine
usage
i
expected
so
much
more
you
could
quaff
it
but
its
certainly
not
sessionable
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
especially
at
the
exuberant
price
its
sold
at
in
the
usa
wouldnt
pair
well
with
food
hides
its
abv
well
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
hazy
amberorange
pour
with
huge
meringuelike
three
finger
head
with
great
lacing
and
retention
huge
citrus
nose
at
first
that
quickly
give
way
to
a
sour
almost
musty
vinous
aroma
that
lets
you
know
theres
plenty
of
brett
in
this
one
the
nelson
sauvignon
hops
eventually
poke
their
head
out
but
are
pretty
much
overpowered
by
the
funk
of
the
brett
the
taste
follows
suit
with
lots
of
apple
cider
tartness
and
mouth
puckering
sourness
hints
of
pear
lemon
zest
apple
melon
and
a
touch
of
orange
emerge
early
but
are
quickly
overpowered
by
the
funk
of
the
brett
which
dominates
the
ns
hops
are
there
in
a
subtle
way
but
not
enough
for
me
as
it
warms
the
sourness
fades
a
bit
and
gives
way
to
some
subtle
sweetness
and
lots
of
white
wine
and
oak
notes
with
a
touch
of
pepper
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
a
lot
of
champagne
with
a
nice
crisp
dry
finish
nelson
sauvignon
are
my
favorite
hops
which
led
me
to
grab
this
im
slightly
disappointed
as
the
hops
are
definitely
not
the
star
with
this
beer
and
im
not
a
fan
of
brett
in
my
beer
with
that
said
this
was
surprisingly
drinkable
and
i
could
see
why
it
would
be
a
great
beer
for
those
that
enjoy
brett
another
great
interpretation
from
mikkeller
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
id
put
off
drinking
this
for
a
while
assuming
it
would
be
a
chore
to
finish
but
couldnt
have
been
more
wrong
its
bloody
delicious
with
complexity
that
is
accommodating
rather
than
testing
d
and
o
a
pretty
good
beer
fairly
interesting
easy
drinking
for
the
9
a
b
v
it
reminds
me
of
the
luciernaga
by
jolly
pumpkin
but
id
prefer
lucie
good
beer
nothing
outstanding
i
was
really
interested
to
try
this
one
and
bought
it
as
soon
as
it
showed
up
at
my
local
store
i
am
glad
i
did
as
this
beer
was
a
very
nice
one
to
try
complex
and
interesting
my
only
complaint
about
this
one
is
that
its
expensive
but
that
is
what
you
get
from
mikkeler
reviewed
blind
as
part
of
blind
bif
6
it
pours
a
sunrise
amber
with
a
mild
haze
like
the
light
mist
on
a
hunters
morn
not
that
i
would
know
trust
me
and
topped
by
more
than
plenty
of
creamwhite
foam
damn
im
glad
i
didnt
aggressively
pour
this
thing
the
nose
comprises
tart
orange
tart
lemon
light
brett
funk
a
decent
amount
of
onion
a
bit
of
cabbage
or
something
of
that
ilk
in
the
very
back
and
a
few
hot
spots
of
pine
resin
here
or
there
then
things
hit
the
tongue
hoofah
a
blast
of
brett
right
in
the
kisser
ive
gotten
compliments
on
my
work
in
that
area
yup
giving
off
a
lot
of
blanket
some
mild
cobweb
theres
a
bit
of
orange
behind
that
along
with
what
seems
like
oak
or
cedar
or
some
sort
of
softish
wood
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
damn
dry
finish
a
touch
on
the
sticky
side
of
life
aka
the
movetheaterfloor
side
overall
i
applaud
the
effort
here
but
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
overt
and
for
the
most
part
unrivaled
brett
aspect
here
its
just
too
much
wow
thats
the
first
response
appearance
is
a
brownish
gold
with
a
thick
foam
smell
is
sour
with
citrus
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
what
you
would
want
viscous
with
a
foamy
finish
taste
is
what
gets
ya
sour
lemon
peels
and
then
the
aging
in
the
sav
blanc
barrels
comes
thru
big
time
alsmost
has
a
champagne
ending
one
of
my
top
beers
i
have
in
2011
thanks
to
matt
at
brown
derby
in
springfield
mo
for
pulling
one
out
for
me
when
i
walked
in
the
door
an
above
average
interesting
sweet
and
fruity
mild
sour
this
reminded
me
of
one
of
fantomes
fruitier
saisons
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
love
the
overall
fruitiness
and
mild
hop
bitterness
not
to
mention
the
well
hidden
9
alcohol
content
im
happy
to
see
this
listed
as
a
regular
in
the
rotating
line
up
and
look
forward
to
more
in
the
future
thumbs
up
overall
a
fun
beer
with
a
very
nice
flavor
the
only
downside
is
the
19
99
pricetag
for
a
750ml
skål
nice
light
body
with
good
carbonation
this
one
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
really
enjoyable
this
is
amazing
as
advertised
i
wish
it
was
a
little
easier
to
track
down
as
it
would
go
well
on
a
special
occasion
and
is
very
drinkable
this
is
perfect
pours
a
virtually
opaque
glowing
reddishbrown
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
tons
of
lace
the
nose
gives
off
wonderful
aromas
of
big
nelson
sauvin
fruit
grass
citrus
melon
pineapple
and
sauvignon
blanc
pear
lemon
grass
pineapple
more
citrus
wet
rock
notes
that
harmonize
extremely
well
and
play
with
a
caramelly
malt
backbone
some
mildly
vanillalaced
oak
notes
and
a
brett
presence
must
pineapple
funk
that
is
healthy
but
not
main
stage
taste
reveals
what
i
am
hoping
for
a
balanced
sweet
and
dry
blend
of
fruit
earth
and
grass
chewy
mediumfull
body
that
seems
light
and
fluffy
the
brett
is
there
but
just
enough
to
amplify
the
other
flavors
and
it
comes
in
on
the
back
end
like
you
want
it
to
a
lot
going
on
here
but
it
is
all
in
chorus
so
it
is
pumped
up
like
a
human
microphone
and
works
very
well
one
of
mikkelllers
best
efforts
in
my
memory
delicious
overall
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
its
somewhere
between
a
belgian
pale
and
a
sauvignon
blanc
just
as
the
label
promises
and
thats
something
unique
and
surprisingly
good
cheers
soft
brett
and
slight
acidity
in
the
taste
orangegrapefruit
right
with
white
grape
juice
chardonnay
barrels
are
in
there
some
orangekiwipear
sweet
and
sourness
bitter
hop
bite
and
brett
on
the
finish
that
comes
out
of
nowhere
really
strange
mixture
of
flavors
and
sensations
that
work
very
well
together
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
odd
and
not
as
carbonated
as
i
thought
it
might
have
been
after
the
pour
some
carbonation
on
the
palate
at
first
then
it
becomes
soft
and
creamy
losing
most
its
carbonation
rather
quickly
a
little
sweet
candied
malt
going
on
lots
of
herbal
dried
grass
and
fresh
hay
flavors
with
a
developing
mixture
of
grapefruit
berries
and
citrus
rind
the
beer
has
a
nice
white
wine
tart
character
that
carries
throughout
the
brew
as
well
keeping
it
refreshing
and
thoughtful
im
getting
some
lovely
toasted
oak
and
more
pronounced
wine
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
it
finishes
dry
and
earthy
in
the
mouth
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
one
might
develop
over
a
year
or
two
wow
an
amazing
unique
beer
with
only
a
slight
flaw
it
pours
a
slight
hazy
brown
amber
with
a
gorgeous
thick
rocky
head
leaving
thick
curtains
of
lacing
in
its
wake
the
nose
is
pure
california
sauv
blanc
with
a
dusting
of
new
zealand
gooseberries
bright
juicy
ruby
red
grapefruit
bitter
orange
zest
shadings
of
light
oaky
vanilla
along
with
a
lemon
grass
herbal
edge
and
a
hint
of
slate
the
taste
is
pure
grapefruit
gooseberries
a
hint
of
barrel
almost
a
semillon
richness
to
balance
the
sauv
blanc
qualities
and
honeysuckle
very
vinous
my
only
issue
is
the
beer
finishes
very
dry
with
mouth
drying
tannins
sadly
i
would
love
to
age
this
beer
but
when
the
hops
fade
i
think
the
oakiness
will
be
even
more
pronounced
that
said
a
truly
amazing
beer
overall
this
is
really
good
and
worth
the
12
i
paid
for
it
taste
is
very
unique
funky
earthiness
following
the
nose
along
with
all
the
aforementioned
flavors
on
the
nose
also
a
bit
sweet
on
the
finish
that
turns
dry
and
bitter
there
has
to
be
brett
in
this
this
is
interesting
but
not
sure
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
onot
at
all
what
i
expected
but
still
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
fantastic
innovative
beer
and
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
having
a
few
more
before
they
sell
out
o
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
one
the
wine
flavors
really
came
through
and
added
a
pleasant
flavor
to
the
beer
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
also
surprised
im
the
first
reviewer
but
its
a
rather
well
done
wild
ale
that
is
good
now
and
would
be
interesting
to
try
with
some
age
on
it
as
well
recommended
a
wonderfully
balanced
beer
with
some
interesting
flavour
profiles
great
fruit
funk
and
malt
complex
and
refreshing
d
good
because
it
is
different
gives
flavors
of
a
sour
and
qualities
of
one
and
then
mixes
in
the
bspa
in
in
some
ways
it
works
and
in
other
ways
it
does
not
like
how
the
brett
is
mixed
in
but
at
times
it
is
a
little
aggressive
starting
to
get
his
stuff
in
an
odd
way
would
buy
again
for
the
reason
it
is
very
different
drinkability
is
great
great
balance
i
love
the
winey
barrel
character
tasty
an
interesting
drop
very
unique
largely
for
its
funkiness
but
even
more
for
its
surprising
subtlety
could
i
drink
this
every
day
yes
would
i
probably
not
might
be
good
paired
with
food
and
just
for
a
casual
sip
a
very
interesting
brew
this
one
and
one
im
very
pleased
to
have
tried
cheers
to
the
guy
at
platinum
cellars
in
bellevue
hill
for
chucking
this
in
to
my
last
purchase
its
certainly
a
unique
and
exciting
brew
incredible
balance
alcohol
is
perfectly
integrated
great
mikkeller
you
are
a
master
fullbodied
and
creamy
utterly
refreshing
split
3
ways
with
some
good
pals
and
good
food
but
i
could
easily
have
polished
it
off
myself
great
stuff
too
bad
its
a
one
off
it
felt
like
a
mix
of
a
sweet
belgian
strong
ale
with
a
tripel
with
relatively
a
decent
amount
of
herbal
hops
which
is
welcome
and
balanced
although
this
had
a
very
good
execution
it
might
not
be
short
of
deus
it
is
not
my
preferred
style
and
i
usually
prefer
less
sweet
beers
lighter
orangeyellow
in
colour
voluminous
white
head
with
fantastic
retention
and
lacing
bretty
and
tropical
fruits
on
the
nose
with
some
champagne
qualities
has
some
similar
notes
to
the
mikkeller
sauvin
brut
bright
citrus
and
tropical
character
on
the
palate
wood
lower
than
champagne
carbonation
and
fantastically
gentle
carbonation
my
top
beer
at
mondiale
very
cool
beer
to
try
but
i
didnt
buy
this
beer
but
would
never
pay
the
36
it
cost
at
the
lbs
pours
very
straw
to
pale
gold
with
a
champagne
like
liveliness
with
a
thick
soapy
2
foam
cap
that
quickly
dissipates
clean
fruit
and
floral
aromas
and
taste
with
a
slight
hint
of
sweetness
and
some
definite
white
wine
qualities
the
perception
oscillates
between
a
sparkling
wine
and
a
beer
and
you
swing
between
the
yeast
driven
fruit
flavors
and
the
light
malts
very
effervescent
medium
light
body
very
refreshing
overall
very
nice
keeping
in
line
with
my
previous
encounters
with
brouwerij
bosteels
offerings
this
was
top
notch
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
so
far
so
good
like
a
hybrid
dry
cider
and
saison
really
refreshing
pours
a
fizzy
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
herbal
and
has
a
good
amount
of
belgian
the
taste
is
herbal
and
lightly
tangy
faint
hops
and
champagne
like
flavor
finishes
clean
and
semi
dry
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
thank
you
beeradvocate
ive
learned
so
much
in
the
6
years
of
being
on
this
site
im
happy
i
made
it
to
review

light

palate
full
of

pears

come
to
mind
very
mild

just
a
hint
of
yeast
funk
very
well
balanced
medium
body
slick
feel
with
a
crisp
finish
first
of
this
style
ive
tried
and
im
glad
to
say
its
a
winner
good
but
honestly
once
is
enough
whem
it
comes
direct
from
boostel
in
refrigerated
containers
the
aroma
and
flavors
still
fresh
and
it
is
really
great
and
amazing
the
bubbles
exploding
in
your
nose
i
really
love
it
the
taste
starts
spicy
with
matching
coriander
and
lemony
citrus
taste
that
was
hinted
at
in
the
nose
with
slight
sweet
malt
and
yeast
flavor
coming
through
mid
palate
th
taste
of
the
yeast
adds
another
dimension
to
the
spice
with
a
carbonic
acid
and
light
alcohol
flavor
emerging
toward
the
finish
which
has
a
tangy
sweet
quality
even
though
the
carbonation
gives
a
dry
impression
overall
i
was
impressed
and
did
not
expect
to
like
this
nearly
as
much
it
certainly
is
everything
it
promotes
itself
as
pretty
interesting
champagne
bier
with
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
with
mild
alcohol
which
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
enjoy
for
11
similar
to
the
aroma
i
pick
up
more
spicy
characters
in
the
taste
the
ginger
really
forces
itself
forward
beyond
the
biscuit
malts
and
other
spices
lingering
light
fruit
character
at
the
end
if
someone
was
to
ask
me
6
months
from
now
what
i
thought
of
this
beer
my
answer
would
be
one
word
ginger
good
or
bad
thats
what
i
take
away
from
it
interesting
its
like
beer
champagne
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
style
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
grade
it
against
while
i
appreciate
this
beer
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
it
would
be
fun
to
show
up
to
a
tasting
with
this
poured
beer
poured
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
large
foamy
head
that
dissapated
rapidly
had
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
lacings
it
had
grassy
flavor
with
strong
streets
of
yeast
malts
and
grains
punctuated
by
traces
of
sugar
sweetness
fruit
and
hops
it
has
medium
edge
becuase
of
the
alcohol
content
which
is
11
5
abv
goes
down
okay
and
leaves
strong
aftertast
pretty
filling
carbonation
makes
for
a
fluffy
effervescence
kept
in
check
by
a
strong
crispness
and
a
body
that
just
reaches
medium
and
feels
appropriate
there
it
is
still
on
the
very
light
side
of
medium
of
course
and
has
lots
of
smoothness
its
clean
which
seems
very
important
and
difficult
to
achieve
for
this
particular
beer
an
excellent
beer
and
unlike
any
ive
tried
previously
proving
to
be
a
fairly
easy
one
to
drink
despite
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
at
over
11
abv
smooth
and
lively
with
a
great
body
whilst
dry
the
beer
went
down
well
with
a
solid
crisp
finish
a
beer
worth
picking
up
again
despite
the
high
price
deus
captures
that
classic
persona
perfectly
and
while
2030bottle
may
be
expensive
by
beer
standards
that
amount
gets
you
nowhere
in
the
world
of
champagne
a
sparkling
wine
of
comparable
quality
to
this
would
run
you
at
least
four
times
that
amount
this
is
an
exceptional
example
of
a
rare
style
and
while
it
does
make
for
an
impressive
bottle
to
show
off
in
the
cellar
dont
age
it
its
perfect
fresh
enjoy
now
with
someone
special
overall
good
but
not
incredible
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
complexity
id
expect
from
the
high
abv
though
possibly
i
had
it
a
little
too
cold
i
would
expect
something
calling
itself
brut
to
handle
being
served
a
little
on
the
cold
side
though
overall
lots
of
flavours
going
on
and
a
ton
of
complexity
not
something
id
drink
a
whole
lot
of
or
very
often
but
a
very
fitting
beer
for
new
years
eve
something
every
beer
drinker
should
try
to
see
how
diverse
brewing
can
be
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
its
right
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
style
o
this
is
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tried
incredibly
smooth
dangerously
hidden
abv
and
wildly
flavourful
a
welcome
change
from
the
norm
and
surprisingly
delicious
definitely
worth
a
try
and
ill
grab
another
couple
bottles
for
the
beer
fridge
no
smoke
in
my
house
and
i
quit
smoking
a
long
time
ago
beer
served
in
a
tall
pils
glass
at
refrigerator
temperatures
this
is
how
i
enjoy
all
beers
at
home
except
lambic
and
handpulled
english
ale
if
the
opportunity
ever
presents
this
was
the
first
beer
of
my
night
and
i
did
not
drink
it
with
food
or
anything
else
very
transparent
looks
like
a
light
cider
cloves
candi
sugar
a
little
bit
of
lemon
maybe
orange
peel
absolutely
delicious
white
grapes
maybe
chardonnay
grapes
this
is
like
a
bubbly
chardonnay
crossed
with
a
saison
really
really
good
this
stuff
has
been
getting
really
popular
i
have
seen
it
on
tv
and
has
been
selling
out
fast
like
i
mentioned
previously
i
see
it
more
and
more
at
different
places
at
going
for
what
i
perceive
to
be
retarded
prices
i
feel
like
most
people
buy
it
not
because
of
the
taste
but
because
of
the
perceived
luxury
same
as
with
champagne
for
many
i
have
been
asked
by
many
people
how
it
tastes
like
i
always
say
cheap
champagne
if
you
want
champagne
buy
that
if
you
want
beer
get
something
else
if
you
want
a
good
champagne
beer
get
malheur
dark
brut
which
is
actually
really
good
and
delicious
overall
i
am
impressed
recently
had
another
champagnestyle
beer
that
didnt
score
well
this
one
is
like
a
caddy
compared
to
a
fiat
i
hesitated
to
buy
this
marked
at
33
on
sale
for
27
i
might
have
to
buy
another
and
save
it
for
a
special
occasion
reading
other
reports
a
flute
is
better
for
carbonation
o
holy
crap
i
havent
had
a
beer
blow
my
mind
like
this
in
quite
a
while
like
nothing
else
out
there
o
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
a
perfect
blend
of
saison
and
champagne
this
is
a
pricy
but
unique
beer
that
is
made
for
celebrations
ive
popped
the
cork
on
oneor
more
of
these
for
multiple
new
years
eve
celebrations
not
something
id
drink
everyday
even
though
it
is
a
superb
beer
o
very
good
beer
flavors
are
all
mellow
and
well
integrated
no
sharpness
of
flavor
at
all
its
super
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
despite
11
5
abv
yet
at
the
same
time
its
zesty
and
crisp
lots
of
nice
fruitiness
from
start
to
finish
quite
sweet
overall
too
definitely
not
brut
as
in
the
champagnesparkling
wine
world
this
is
by
all
means
an
exceptional
beer
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
tripel
and
a
saison
in
terms
of
flavor
and
really
interesting
with
the
champagne
carbonation
the
2010
bottle
exploded
upon
opening
running
active
white
foam
all
down
the
sides
the
pour
is
a
little
hard
to
control
looks
a
lot
like
bubbly
with
a
rising
big
airy
white
head
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
like
a
triple
belgian
yeasty
but
a
little
funky
and
farmy
like
a
good
saison
some
spice
notes
and
honey
make
it
very
thanksgivingish
to
me
sweetness
up
front
and
yeast
in
the
finish
definitely
honey
and
maybe
cinnamon
very
desserty
and
a
coffeecake
sort
of
malt
profile
some
dried
fruit
in
there
too
maybe
apricots
the
feel
is
tremendous
explosive
carbonation
and
a
fairly
light
body
for
what
it
is
its
easy
to
forget
the
alcohol
is
11
5
abv
its
easy
drinking
and
gets
you
drunk
quick
like
i
had
to
have
my
girlfriend
drive
home
because
of
this
baby
so
be
careful
when
slamming
it
down
and
remember
its
stronger
than
it
seems
a
very
interesting
article
one
id
like
to
drink
again
around
the
holidays
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
kind
of
was
expecting
more
from
this
opened
a
rocket
gusher
at
a
good
temperature
offwhite
head
was
so
big
as
to
be
almost
unmanagable
but
then
settled
to
zero
and
no

color
is
a
clear
yellow
with
plenty
of
bubble
trails
body
and
carbonation
are
good
aroma
is
mainly
yeasty
with
some
spice
and
malt
flavor
is
where
i
docked
them
again
as
the
name
says
brut
subtle
sugar
acidic
hues
as
well
as
fruity
notes
mango
apricot
to
the
nose
crispy
upfront
rounded
by
candies
corriander
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
less
complex
than
i
was
anticipating
an
outstanding
and
complex
beer
its
pretty
amazing
how
much
this
feels
like
a
champagne
id
say
this
is
the
perfect
brew
to
have
for
a
celebration
or
special
event

crazy
that
this
is
a
beer
it
really
is
a
must
try
i
love
the
explanation
of
how
its
produced
i
can
see
why
the
pricetag
is
so
high
its
not
the
easiest
drinking
beer
and
should
be
treated
as
champagne
i
would
revisit
this
again
for
a
celebration
such
as
new
years
i
was
actually
happy
to
find
that
i
wasnt
super
duper
crazy
about
this
beer
my
tastes
run
more
in
the
nice
belgian
trippel
and
strong
ipa
ranges
which
are
expensive
as
far
as
beer
goes
but
much
cheaper
than
something
like
this
good
but
not
the
the
best
in
flavor
in
my
opinion
i
dont
regret
the
purchase
by
any
means
but
i
wont
crave
it
the
way
i
crave
chimay
trippel
la
fin
du
monde
or
green
flash
ipa
d
fantastic
beer
worth
celebrating
with
next
time
skip
the
champagne
and
get
this
bier
de
champagne
instead
medium
mouthfeel
but
feels
light
and
airy
with
the
copious
amounts
of
carbonation
very
enjoyable
overall
a
bit
expensive
but
worth
it
on
a
special
occasion
drinkability
seems
to
get
better
with
every
sip
had
my
doubts
but
this
beer
was
quite
good
complex
unique
celebratory
perfect
for
new
years
andor
the
cellar
what
i
was
hoping
infinium
would
be
like
d
didnt
enjoy
it
much
but
i
had
no
difficulty
drinking
it
i
still
say
that
you
either
buy
champagne
or
a
different
beer
if
you
must
try
this
style
try
to
look
for
malheur
cuvée
royale
cost
is
too
much
i
got
it
for
12

and
i
felt
that
that
was
way
too
much
and
that
was
on
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
for
this
beer
deus
is
a
great
beer
for
sharing
at
special
occasions
i
would
not
want
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
and
im
certain
that
i
would
be
bored
by
halfway
truthfully
i
was
done
with
this
a
few
gulps
in
it
just
does
not
do
anything
for
my
palate
id
rather
just
drink
a
hopped
up
wheat
wine
cause
thats
what
this
reminds
me
off
without
the
hops
of
course
note
2009
vintage
d
well
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
all
in
all
about
as
good
as
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
id
like
to
see
this
done
to
a
flanders
red
tasty
but
not
one
id
do
again
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
some
visible
bubbles
rising
up
starts
out
with
huge
white
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
pretty
quickly
no
lacing
at
all
smells
a
little
bit
funky
and
sour
in
a
good
way
though
very
yeasty
too
in
the
aroma
flavour
is
quite
dry
thinner
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
seems
a
bit
undercarbonated
compared
to
champagne
nice
to
try
but
i
wont
get
this
again
given
the
price
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
very
easy
for
11
5
i
think
this
beer
is
an
excellent
blend
of
the
beer
and
wine
world
i
wouldnt
ever
mind
celebrating
with
this
beer
thanks
to
my
son
who
gave
this
as
a
gift
thanks
big
guy
an
enjoyable
drink
a
very
well
executed
melding
of
adjacent
yet
complementary
worlds
the
sweet
strong
belgian
pale
ale
given
the
day
spa
treatment
of
la
méthode
champenoise
i
would
say
that
the
appearance
and
aroma
retain
the
french
influence
and
the
rest
belgian
all
the
way
mon
petit
chou
a
big
fat
win
for
european
economic
and
drinking
cooperation
and
a
fine
way
to
celebrate
another
splendid
year
with
my
girl
dear
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
tight
carbonation
up
front
that
somehow
isnt
over
the
top
pretty
sweet
tasting
with
a
lot
of
light
fruit
breadyeast
and
subtle
alcohol
warmth
well
balanced
and
very
quaffable
with
hints
of
sour
apple
pear
banana
and
citrus
excellently
masked
abv
with
a
dry
finish
this
beer
tastes
half
as
strong
as
it
actually
is
an
interesting
hybrid
of
champagne
and
belgian
golden
ale
the
cork
on
this
deus
bottle
partially
released
itself
with
a
satisfyingly
sounding
pop
beer
loving
couples
may
really
consider
this
for
a
wedding
champagne
the
deus
could
probably
use
a
tad
bit
more
sweetness
overall
it
was
interesting
beer
of
very
rare
style
but
i
am
not
sure
i
could
afford
to
drink
it
very
often
d
very
good
drinkable
beer
much
better
than
champagne
a
pretty
well
crafted
beer
good
balance
and
it
was
hard
to
taste
the
alcohol
4

who
needs
champagne
when
youve
got
deus
its
certainly
worth
what
it
costs
id
buy
a
bottle
and
store
it
for
a
special
occassion
d
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
which
makes
the
high
abv
surprising
a
bit
spendy
but
probably
would
put
it
about
other
similar
beers
like
duvel
poured
it
into
a
duvel
chalice
d
delicious
really
interesting
beer
my
family
are
more
wine
drinkers
and
they
cant
believe
theres
not
fruit
in
the
ingredients
this
beer
pours
with
a
pale
golden
color
the
head
follows
the
expectations
with
any
champignon
the
aromas
are
heavy
with
with
pear
and
other
sour
notes
despite
this
beer
being
from
two
kinds
of
beverages
which
bring
expectations
of
intense
carbonation
this
beverage
is
not
is
as
intense
as
you
would
expect
the
aroma
brings
on
heavy
notes
of
green
apple
the
flavor
is
full
of
those
green
apple
notes
with
heavy
hints
of
honey
in
the
finish
this
was
amazing
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
farmhouse
style
ale
however
with
much
drier
finish
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
was
loaded
with
spicy
malty
flavors
with
a
touch
of
banana
and
creme
brolee
in
the
finish
you
notice
a
dry
patch
in
the
back
of
your
throat
which
i
have
only
come
across
a
few
times
in
my
adventers
in
beer
it
is
a
bit
pricey
but
i
dont
mind
paying
for
it
if
the
occasion
suits
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
nice
and
prickly
like
fizzy
old
champagne
how
strange
extremely
clea
pale
straw
color
very
white
nice
champagne
hea
at
pour
settles
to
larger
bubbles
spicer
aroma
some
alcohol
present
as
well
not
as
spivey
as
it
smells
alcohol
comes
through
on
finish
a
little
floralness
in
the
overall
very
clean
good
balance
i
enjoy
the
spices
not
being
overbearing
vert
drinkable
nice
overall
beer
good
for
an
inagural
all
grain
brewing
not
quit
sure
its
worth
the
price
but
still
very
good

this
is
a
great
beer
one
that
shows
how
beer
can
rise
to
great
heights
but
does
it
on
its
own
terms
this
has
the
puissance
finesse
and
fruite
of
a
good
if
not
very
good
champagne
yet
it
still
tastes
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
a
beer
for
a
celebration
my
friends
and
i
enjoyed
it
during
the
last
game
of
the
2010
world
series
overall
this
beer
has
significant
champagne
overtones
and
venture
into
cider
peare
and
timid
malt
character
which
bridges
many
aspects
of
fermented
beverages
the
testamony
of
this
beer
speaks
wonders
about
the
possability
of
what
beer
can
be
overall
a
very
tastey
and
complex
brew
d
cant
say
i
can
justify
this
beer
30
is
way
to
much
for
this
as
its
not
that
great
in
my
mind
carbonation
is
way
to
high
drinkabilityreally
unique
belgium
beer
tons
of
depth
and
complexity
this
seems
to
be
a
champagne
made
with
grain
rather
than
grapes
the
guide
even
suggests
using
champagne
glasses
it
is
growing
on
me
as
i
try
it
with
friends
in
belgium
once
i
got
my
mind
around
this
i
began
to
enjoy
this
offering
its
quite
good
if
you
dont
expect
anything
that
resembles
a
beer
notes
vintage
2009
not
really
as
champagnesparking
wine
tasting
as
i
was
kind
of
expecting
more
spiced
cider
like
but
it
did
have
some
sparkling
wine
aspects
as
well
overall
it
was
a
nice
zesty
drink
d
i
had
been
meaning
to
try
this
one
for
a
long
time
but
never
got
around
to
it
then
my
buddy
juan
picked
up
a
bottle
and
we
gave
it
a
try
overall
i
would
say
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
it
is
certainly
a
unique
beer
the
alcohol
stays
mostly
in
check
especially
considering
the
huge
abv
making
this
dangerously
drinkable
i
wanted
to
show
the
gf
this
style
as
i
have
had
some
good
ones
sadly
this
wasnt
the
one
to
try
to
get
her
hooked
on
so
many
better
options
out
that
you
are
free
to
skip
this
d
pricey
very
much
so
but
even
so
its
a
wonderful
experience
a
must
for
special
occasions
beer
is
surprisingly
thin
lots
of
carbonation
but
im
not
fooled
there
is
a
spiciness
to
it
almost
a
peppery
note
to
the
whole
thing
mild
sweetness
on
the
front
end
finishes
quite
dry
i
dont
know
its
not
as
good
as
i
hoped
dont
think
its
a
repeat
for
me
unfortunately
id
be
willing
to
try
other
examples
that
are
supposedly
not
as
good
as
this
one
also
saw
bottles
for
sale

medium

in
a
good

to

this

i
like
this
a
lot
but
cant
see
buying
it
often
given
the
price
d
it
may
be
easy
to
drink
in
regards
to
taste
and
complexity
but
the
abv
will
knock
your
socks
off
in
addition
the
odd
floral
accents
might
get
tiresome
after
a
while
good
beerchampagne
hybrid
but
between
the
price
and
the
style
its
not
something
to
have
frequently
good
for
celebrating
something
andor
as
a
conversation
piece
at
a
party
d
its
drinkable
but
i
do
tire
of
the
sweet
taste
i
am
glad
i
just
had
1
glass
i
would
not
want
to
drink
the
entire
bottle
d
very
very
drinkable
this
is
definitely
going
to
be
one
to
break
out
for
others
to
try
especially
as
a
conversion
type
beer
an
all
around
good
to
very
good
beer
but
doesnt
justify
the
hoopla
of
french
champagne
or
the
price
tag
caution
have
your
glass
ready
a
single
pause
and
the
beer
starts
gushing
some
milestones
just
cant
be
celebrated
with
your
runofthemill
special
beer
but
what
selfrespecting
beerhead
wants
to
be
seen
hoisting
up
a
dainty
champagne
flute
as
beer
goes
its
hard
to
find
a
finer
more
subtle
clearer
or
more
finessed
ale
but
its
certainly
not
a
gift
from
above
at
worst
its
the
best
alternative
to
champagne
ive
ever
found
if
youve
got
the
cash
2232
depending
and
a
reason
to
celebrate
this
is
a
musttry
its
almost
reason
enough
to
go
buy
champagne
flutes
enjoy
glad
i
had
the
other
champagne
beer
at
the
same
time
puts
this
one
very
firmly
into
second
place
the
appearance
is
decent
with
a
nice
full
frothy
head
and
a
beautiful
cascade
of
bubbles
like
you
would
find
in
any
champagne
but
then
there
was
the
taste
i
cant
even
tell
what
this
is
it
dose
not
have
either
the
dryness
or
the
wet
fruitiness
you
would
find
in
champagnes
at
the
same
time
it
barely
resembles
beer
it
is
almost
flavorless
and
what
it
does
have
is
almost
like
carbonated
parsley
the
malt
profile
was
quite
nice
but
not
enough
to
save
this
travesty
deus
was
a
bit
of
an
eye
opener
pop
this
out
in
a
champagne
situation
and
watch
the
nonbeer
drinkers
as
they
taste
it
a
fantastic
beer
for
celebration
and
proving
what
beer
can
be
to
nonbeer
drinkers
overall
a
truly
special
brew
a
must
try
at
least
once
i
suggest
keeping
a
couple
bottles
around
for
when
the
mood
strikes
i
was
expecting
a
much
different
journey
with
deus
in
honesty
i
dont
drink
champagne
so
i
really
had
no
idea
where
this
beer
would
go
it
sure
is
interesting
though
but
id
only
want
a
little
at
a
time
it
looks
like
ill
be
sipping
on
the
750
ml
bottle
until
the
new
year
i
shared
this
with
a
bunch
of
people
but
drank
the
majority
of
it
with
no
problem
truely
a
unique
beer
and
one
best
shared
with
loved
ones
on
a
special
occasion
because
this
bottle
could
easily
put
the
largest
men
on
there
ass
before
they
knew
what
hit
them
this
is
not
an
everyday
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
for
special
occasions
it
makes
a
good
talking
point
and
a
good
way
to
stick
with
beer
when
most
people
would
not
give
it
a
chance
d
very
good
i
enjoyed
this
with
a
couple
of
friends
and
they
were
very
happy
to
sit
around
and
drink
some
beer
champagne
i
really
wanted
to
open
one
of
my
other
two
bottles
i
have
just
waiting
for
the
right
time
to
open
it
i
just
dont
get
this
beer
i
usually
score
based
on
style
but
given
the
unique
nature
of
this
beer
i
have
to
rate
on
overall
impression
dont
particularly
like
it
certainly
would
not
buy
again
given
the
price
point
750

bottle
bought
by
bryan

a
champagne
beer
and
nearly

at

strawcolored
rapidly
disappearing
head
so
appears
flat
in
the
glass
tastes
like
champagne
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
gimmicky
especially
the
dom
perignot
bottle
not
worth
the
pricetag
next
time
an
occasion
arises
requiring
a
nice
bottle
of
champagne
grab
one
of
these
instead
this
was
my
first
champagne
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
beers
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
the
beer
has
many
small
bubbles
like
champagne
and
the
bubbles
remained
during
the
entire
time
it
was
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
lemons
and
malt
and
the
taste
was
similar
with
some
yeast
in
there
as
well
for
a
beer
that
was
11
5
abv
the
alcohol
is
nearly
completely
hidden
the
beer
didnt
taste
like
champagne
but
the
high
carbonation
made
it
feel
like
champagne
as
you
drank
it
this
is
an
expensive
beer
and
is
not
an
every
day
drinker
but
for
a
special
occasion
i
dont
think
you
can
go
wrong
with
deus
prost
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
with
a
big
carbonation
that
sings
to
you
from
the
glass
nose
is
nutmeg
allspice
cloves
juniper
and
a
kiss
of
sourness
flavor
is
a
big
somewhat
cloying
spice
flavor
with
subtle
tartness
giving
way
to
a
menthol
finish
perhaps
even
a
splendaesque
aftertaste
a
neat
beer
but
it
doesnt
work
for
me
think
gin
and
diet
tonic
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
8
5
5oz
glass
but
i
was
very
impressed
and
would
definitely
buy
this
again
despite
the
high
price
mouthfeel
is
very
much
in
line
with
a
standard
champagne
even
though
the
flavor
is
not
it
is
very
smooth
with
an
almost
mousse
like
texture
d
wonderful
to
sip
the
floral
and
spiceinfused
aroma
makes
you
want
to
have
more
just
to
enjoy
its
uniqueness
an
excellent
beer
d
high
alcohol
you
feel
this
one
right
away
hearty
but
also
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
beautifully
hidden
an
excellent
sipping
beer
overall
a
great
beer
its
not
something
i
would
purchase
often
but
for
special
occasions
this
is
a
beer
lovers
champagne
alternative
you
get
the
champagne
experience
and
appeal
with
all
the
belgian
or
wild
beer
lovers
indulgences
plus
this
beer
gets
bonus
points
for
creativity
drinkability
its
easy
to
drink
but
to
me
this
just
was
a
little
off
i
would
recommend
it
for
the
price
of
30
a
bottle
almost
worth
a
look
once
just
out
of
how
unique
this
is
for
a
beer
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
some
beers
but
in
someway
you
do
feel
it
more
like
a
champagne
a
one
time
try
for
me
simply
one
of
the
most
complex
brews
ive
ever
tasted
a
very
interesting
style
of
beer
doubtless
not
to
be
considered
a
champagne
by
any
means
but
the
beer
like
quality
is
very
iffy
this
is
really
a
borderline
style
and
a
true
innovation
of
modern
brewing
very
nice
beer
love
this
one
expensive
but
a
nice
special
occasion
beer
drinkability
sipper
definitely
an
occasion
maker
this
walks
hand
in
hand
with
the
price
not
an
everyday
thing
but
certainly
a
special
treat
for
the
beer
advocate
i
poured
from
a
25
6
ounce
bottle
into
champagne
flutes
the
bottle
opened
with
a
loud
pop
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
yellow
in
appearance
with
a
fizzy
white
head
and
long
streams
of
bubbles
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
a
sweet
white
wine
the
beer
taste
like
a
sparkling
wine
it
is
a
little
sweet
balanced
by
a
bit
of
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
of
lots
of
carbonation
medium
to
light
body
the
beer
is
very
interesting
but
i
will
not
buy
it
again
it
is
a
bit
overpriced
30
bucks
a
bottle
and
if
i
want
something
similiar
i
could
get
a
decent
sparkling
wine
for
less
that
being
said
it
is
amazing
this
is
beer
if
you
have
friends
who
say
they
only
like
wine
let
em
try
deus
very
good
drinkability
although
the
high
abv
and
the
carbonation
keep
it
from
becoming
a
session
beer
that
and
its
30
price
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
but
the
price
is
a
bit
more
than
id
like
to
spend
for
a
single
brew
from
a
large
heavy
champagnelike
bottle
this
one
opens
with
an
explosive
bang
watch
out
for
flying
corks
it
pours
just
like
a
sparkling
wine
except
for
a
slightly
darker
golden
hue
and
a
stable
foam
head
the
bubbles
form
and
rise
just
as
youd
expect
and
the
sensation
in
your
mouth
is
just
like
a
sparkling
wine
as
well
this
is
one
truly
interesting
and
remarkable
beer
sweeter
than
i
expected
its
malt
profile
becomes
central
as
the
beer
warms
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
malt
alcohol
and
carbon
dioxide
and
a
bit
of
fruit
apricot
fresh
and
lively
honey
and
a
little
sugar
come
out
in
the
taste
this
is
a
fun
beer
and
one
that
id
try
again
especially
as
a
champagne
substitute
deus
is
a
very
interesting
beer
its
my
first
bière
de
champagne
so
i
dont
have
any
prior
experience
to
compare
it
to
as
a
beer
its
pretty
good
stuff
and
id
happily
try
other
takes
on
the
style
this
particular
one
could
use
a
little
work
in
the
abv
department
just
a
little
too
hot
and
boozy
thats
the
only
real
complaint
i
have
it
measures
up
pretty
well
otherwise
well
except
for
that
small
price
tag
problem
frankly
its
too
expensive
ive
enjoyed
the
experience
but
wouldnt
pay
the
same
price
for
another
bottle
just
sayin
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
whisp
of
foam
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbles
makes
this
an
exciting
looking
ale
patches
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
subdued
i
detect
some
sweet
fruit
and
maybe
a
little
funk
and
malt
has
an
intriging
taste
slightly
sweet
and
vinous
at
the
start
but
a
definate
tartness
in
the
finish
notes
of
apple
pears
and
cinnamon
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
but
there
is
a
subtle
warming
affect
light
body
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
an
effervescent
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
a
beer
for
special
occasions
is
it
more
enjoyable
than
a
comparably
priced
sparkling
wine
i
would
say
it
would
be
an
excellant
alternative
d
not
too
great
it
was
ok
but
the
alcohol
was
too
heavy
for
me
d
wow
i
cant
get
over
this
beer
a
friend
had
told
me
it
was
amazing
but
damn
words
dont
prepare
you
a
belgian
beerchampagne
and
every
bit
as
wonderful
as
youd
think
from
that
description
cant
recommend
enough
perfect
for
any
celebratory
situation
that
would
call
for
champagne
is
this
really
11
5
abv
youd
have
no
idea
word
d
this
is
a
weird
style
to
be
able
to
call
beer
but
thats
what
it
is
and
its
damn
good
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
id
rather
have
this
than
champagne
great
bottle
presentation
the
beer
was
opened
with
a
nice
loud
pop
but
no
rush
of
beer
out
of
the
bottle
which
is
good
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
rapid
stream
of
bubbles
running
from
the
bottle
great
carbonation
the
thick
white
head
gave
way
to
a
solid
ring
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
after
several
minutes
the
nose
was
sweet
malty
and
spicey
and
the
taste
was
sweet
a
tad
bitter
and
very
full
overall
a
very
nice
beer
sort
of
like
a
champagne
served
from
a
bottle
and
purchased
at
dukes
ale
house
in
crystal
lake
il
appearance
is
bubbly
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
color
is
light
and
golden
there
is
a
hint
of
sweet
pear
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
crisp
light
for
the
alcohol
content
and
has
a
nice
tartness
in
the
after
taste
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
and
definately
worth
some
furthur
investigation
this
could
easily
substitute
for
champagne
in
fact
it
might
be
fun
to
serve
this
to
nonbeer
drinkers
in
place
of
champagne
and
find
out
their
impression
of
the
beer
this
review
is
from
my
recollections
of
last
night
at
the
sunset
bar
and
grill
in
allston
thanks
to
justin
for
getting
a
bottle
of
this
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
little
bit
of
heading
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
looks
a
lot
like
champaign
smell
is
sweet
almost
with
a
sprite
or
ginger
ale
like
quality
taste
was
sugary
sweet
with
definite
fruit
traces
peach
came
to
mind
for
me
body
was
highly
carbonated
and
refreshing
a
bottle
of
this
would
be
easy
to
put
down
imo
great
beer
i
was
surprised
it
wasnt
more
dry
some
time
soon
i
will
get
a
bottle
dont
really
like
this
style
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
judging
by
the
previous
reviews
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
decided
to
splurge
to
ring
in
2009
poured
a
wellcarbonated
bubbly
thin
yellow
body
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
receeds
a
light
fruity
smell
with
faint
air
of
caskconditioning
i
assume
thats
what
i
smelling
since
they
are
using
champagne
storage
methods
on
this
beer
a
sharp
bitter
citric
fruit
taste
along
with
pears
and
apples
also
real
smooth
in
the
mouth
after
you
get
used
to
the
prickliness
and
it
starts
to
sweeten
up
almost
starts
to
get
slick
as
it
rolls
down
the
tongue
and
finishes
real
crisp
and
dry
with
oakiness
a
great
beer
but
ive
had
some
belgians
pretty
similiar
and
for
30
i
would
say
try
this
on
a
special
occasion
but
it
doesnt
warrant
repeatregular
drinking
at
that
price
to
me
and
to
be
honest
if
you
or
your
girl
in
my
case
really
just
want
champagne
you
can
always
buy
some
cheap
spumante
and
save
20
this
is
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
tasted
it
is
a
must
for
any
serious
beer
fan
it
is
worth
the
money
to
try
in
a
day
and
age
where
unexceptional
beers
command
exorborant
prices
this
is
one
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
billing
and
although
expensive
i
have
drank
generic
champagnes
at
twice
the
price
seek
enjoy
and
save
for
a
special
occasion
have
a
great
2009
a
nice
beer
to
ring
in
2009
d
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
though
thats
the
style
750
ml
bottle
2006
vintage
served
in
a
flute
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
carbonated
white
head
head
retention
is
excellent
lacing
is
good
looks
just
like
a
glass
of
champagne
would
it
smells
like
candy
sugar
grapes
pears
yeast
and
peppery
spice
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
pepper
ginger
belgian
yeast
pears
grapes
and
bananas
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
has
high
carbonation
but
its
soft
which
makes
it
feel
nice
and
creamy
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
the
abv
and
the
alcohol
isnt
very
noticable
at
all
it
wouldnt
be
a
problem
to
finish
off
a
bottle
of
this
all
in
all
its
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
even
with
the
25
price
tag
and
drink
it
every
once
in
a
while
its
probably
better
shared
with
friends
but
not
too
bad
for
just
one
person
to
drink
either
d
the
body
is
the
best
feature
of
this
beer
it
is
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
but
still
quite
champagne
like
this
is
definitely
a
special
occasion
beer
not
just
because
of
the
price
but
also
because
it
just
isnt
very
drinkable
overall
although
on
the
expensive
side
it
was
worth
every
penny
if
youre
going
to
be
celebrating
in
style
this
is
the
beer
to
do
it
with
d
its
not
my
style
but
it
was
entertaining
and
cleaned
my
palate
i
could
see
it
as
a
good
before
dinner
drink
with
cheese
fruit
and
veggies
to
high
and
abv
for
a
session
brew
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
interesting
take
on
it
quite
unique
probably
not
worth
the
price
tag
at
least
the
imported
price
tag
here
in
australia
but
good
once
in
a
while
d
a
bottle
is
enough
but
thats
6
champagne
flutes
lol
thank
you
goes
out
to
the
mack
daddy
little
pedro
stumac
lets
stop
at
jack
in
the
box
and
be
late
spritzy
is
a
great
way
to
classify
this
beer
lots
of
sweetness
honey
mostly
is
very
delicious
stuff
is
foam
friendly
is
a
strong
beer
that
is
a
fun
one
to
drink
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
i
highly
doubt
this
is
created
for
mass
consumption
as
that
would
be
sickening
a
great
experience
though
and
id
drink
it
again
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
superb
wine
ahem
beer
ive
written
enough
now
i
shall
drink
pours
up
nice
pale
yellow
with
sparkling
champaignelike
quality
big
nice
white
head
the
nose
is
very
yeasty
notes
of
pears
slight
sour
note
the
taste
is
very
sweet
honey
notes
very
buttery
subtle
dried
fruit
sweet
finish
nice
full
body
good
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
essentially
wine
with
enough
malt
character
to
bring
the
brewing
process
onto
the
palate
wonderful
for
a
celebratory
toast
cheers
make
it
for
special
occasions
only
pretty
good
pretty
expensive
pours
from
a
bottle
into
a
chalice
very
pale
yellow
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
looks
exactly
like
champagne
smell
is
spicy
sweet
with
some
fruit
scents
taste
tastes
exactly
like
freaking
champagne
its
hard
to
believe
this
was
classified
as
beer
i
cant
drink
a
pint
glass
of
champagne
nor
could
i
drink
a
pint
of
this
stuff
like
champagne
it
was
sweet
to
start
and
finished
dry
way
too
much
carbonation
for
this
beer
to
be
enjoyable
filled
the
stomach
with
so
much
air
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
definitely
not
my
style
of
beer
25
down
the
drain
overall
i
was
really
shocked
how
good
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
wonderful
unique
and
delicious
just
amazing
is
it
worth
the
price
yes
am
i
glad
i
have
another
one
in
the
cellar
yes
would
i
buy
another
if
i
had
the
chance
absolutely
the
perfect
beer
for
special
occasions
the
bottle
is
really
nice
looking
upscale
even
im
not
really
sure
what
to
expect
but
as
i
like
most
belgian
beers
im
thinking
positive
ive
popped
the
cork
out
of
quite
a
few
bottles
of
beer
but
holy
shit
that
was
loud
im
a
bit
shaken
but
i
think
i
can
go
on
huge
bubbling
noisy
offwhite
head
fades
quickly
to
a
thick
film
a
bit
of
bubble
gum
and
candied
apricot
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
bit
of
white
grapes
the
aroma
is
definitely
unique
and
id
say
closest
to
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
a
bit
of
vanilla
some
flowers
cotton
candy
and
i
swear
there
is
a
dry
white
whine
flavor
in
there
too
is
it
mental
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
unibroues
la
fin
du
monde
but
even
more
potent
mouthfeel
is
quite
fizzy
with
a
fairly
strong
alcohol
burn
i
like
it
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
strong
and
inviting
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
especially
when
compared
to
traditional
champagne
it
was
fun
to
try
once
but
its
just
too
expensive
to
drink
in
the
future
to
be
fair
i
cant
imagine
any
beer
being
worth
5
to
10
times
the
average
very
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
also
very
expensive
may
thanks
to
fellow
ba
mtanji
for
this
delicious
treat
on
our
recent
visit
i
would
say
its
not
very
drinkable
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
and
the
price
but
it
was
a
good
celebratory
beer
indeed
it
foams
up
and
subsides
to
a
skim
the
nose
is
slightly
spicy
and
the
taste
is
very
spicy
its
somewhat
sweet
but
beguiling
in
its
complexity
the
nose
has
a
little
cork
but
the
taste
is
clean
and
a
little
sweet
but
only
a
little
the
flavor
acts
like
anise
without
the
licorice
it
is
wonderful
im
going
to
stop
reviewing
now
and
drink
beer
d
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
drinkability
is
good
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
though
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
aged
for
several
years
im
going
to
finish
the
rest
of
the
bottle
with
my
favorite
beer
pairing
smoked
salmon
and
water
crackers
another
one
of
those
beers
that
really
blasts
through
the
apparent
limits
of
what
beer
can
be
carbonation
is
through
the
roof
and
forces
you
to
sip
slowly
this
combined
with
the
booziness
really
doesnt
make
for
high
drinkability
drinks
pretty
good
this
goes
down
easier
than
champagne
to
me
the
wife
liked
it
too
to
me
this
was
like
a
saisonwitsparkling
alemead
hybrid
a
great
one
to
try
om
your
wine
snob
friends
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
tried
served
in
a
snifter
from
a
champagne
style
bottle
this
was
clear
and
golden
with
apricot
hues
champagnelike
bubbles
and
a
diminishing
lively
white
head
and
lacing
powerful
and
complex
nose
with
a
funky
earthy
mustiness
light
colored
fruit
flowers
honey
and
more
a
nice
bit
of
sweetness
upfront
is
balanced
out
by
just
enough
sour
character
and
the
lively
carbonation
a
vague
spiciness
also
is
present
mediumbodied
and
effervescent
mouthfeel
complex
finish
fuller
less
sour
mouthfeel
than
champagne
overall
very
nice
mouthfeel
definitely
worth
a
try
and
id
much
prefer
this
to
sparkling
wine
or
champagne
drinkablility
if
this
were
not
so
expensive
i
would
drink
this
every
week
however
the
intensity
of
the
taste
up
front
as
well
as
the
cost
makes
this
one
a
very
special
beer
to
be
consumed
on
a
very
special
occasion
in
this
case
it
was
my
birthday
as
well
as
super
bowl
sunday
fred
eckhardt
was
right
alongside
deus
champagne
is
boring
a
true
masterpiece
i
did
not
particularly
care
for
this
beer
it
appears
in
my
beer
store
and
ive
been
tempted
to
give
it
another
try
but
my
initial
impression
was
an
overly
ginger
character
and
given
the
price
i
didnt
think
it
was
exceptional
750
ml
bottle
got
it
for
28
which
i
thought
was
pricey
but
apparently
its
a
steal
compared
to
the
40
some
other
reviewers
paid
cork
came
off
with
a
champagne
pop
smoke
then
issuing
from
the
bottle
poured
it
into
a
goblet
glass
really
should
have
used
a
flute
even
so
pure
white
3
finger
head
that
settled
down
quickly
leaving
zero
lace
after
sitting
for
1520
minutes
the
head
is
completely
gone
appearance
once
the
head
is
gone
is
just
like
a
sauvignon
blanc
i
could
take
a
picture
of
it
in
a
wine
glass
and
youd
never
know
it
was
beer
tastes
much
better
after
warming
up
a
bit
refrigerator
temperatures
are
definitely
too
cold
for
this
beer
flavors
of
apple
and
banana
with
just
a
wee
little
hint
of
malt
on
the
finish
no
hops
detectable
are
there
even
any
in
this
a
very
unique
and
unusual
beer
if
you
approach
food
pairings
like
you
would
a
white
wine
youll
do
fine
a
very
interesting
beer
it
isnt
so
dry
and
not
too
reminiscent
to
champagne
in
my
opinion
it
is
still
very
unique
and
quite
tastey
worth
a
try
d
id
say
this
is
very
drinkable
high
abv
so
cannot
drink
too
much
but
great
for
a
special
occasion
drinkability
here
once
again
i
find
the
sweetness
a
little
to
much
for
me
otherwise
a
very
approachable
beer
and
with
the
alchohol
so
nicely
hidden
it
works
well
for
what
it
is
at
somewhere
around
40
in
colorado
for
a
bottle
im
not
going
to
buy
this
one
again
d
quite
a
complex
beer
indeed
obviously
not
something
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
even
if
you
have
money
as
there
are
better
choices
at
less
money
for
special
occasions
though
i
guess
its
worth
a
shot
bottle
from
2002
pours
dark
gold
with
a
small
haze
and
a
big
white
head
aroma
is
extremely
complex
with
notes
of
white
pepper
and
big
floral
notes
especially
hawaiian
white
ginger
as
well
as
cinnamon
and
allspice
flavor
is
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
sweet
spicy
and
softly
phenolic
with
notes
of
clove
cinnamon
allspice
and
nutmeg
alcohol
is
apparent
but
very
softly
so
this
is
a
true
gem
of
a
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
worth
seeking
out
and
aging
slight

early
but

drier
and
peppery
with
some

mediumfull

hides
underneath
very
effervescent
bubbly
carbonation
that
helps
make
this
beer
go
down
easy
a
great
unique
beerstyle
world
class
not
a
hard
beer
to
drink
it
could
go
well
with
some
sharp
cheeses
it
could
also
go
well
with
some
fish
the
food
pairing
suggestion
suggests
meat
as
well
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
a
good
pairing
champagne
carbonation
to
this
very
bubbly
and
sharp
on
the
tongue
taste
detracts
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
but
perhaps
because
this
is
new
years
i
had
higher
expectations
poured
into
a
champagne
flout
poured
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
large
fizzy
head
this
is
probably
one
of
the
prettiest
if
you
can
use
this
descriptor
for
beer
beers
i
have
ever
seen
smell
is
spicy
and
sweet
taste
is
much
the
same
i
really
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
mouthfeel
is
just
like
champagne
amazing
this
is
a
really
cool
beer
pop
the
cork
is
art
itself
pours
a
magnificent
toasted
corn
hue
with
a
quick
two
finger
white
layer
of
bubbles
that
die
down
instantly
to
barely
a
thin
crust
of
mist
above
constant
bubbles
from
start
to
finish
smell
is
fresh
and
new
with
a
sweet
perfume
aroma
that
sweetens
the
nose
a
light
caramel
scent
that
leads
you
in
whats
to
come
taste
was
not
what
i
had
expected
big
musky
banana
flavors
with
a
thick
honey
sweetness
solid
carbonation
in
the
mouth
with
a
slick
texture
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
could
be
worse
a
beer
to
share
for
sure
perfect
beer
for
the
occasion
cheers
to
ba
in
2008
the
brick
store
pub
sells
this
by
the
glass
and
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
awhile
so
that
seemed
like
a
good
way
to
sample
it
without
pulling
the
trigger
on
a
whole
bottle
i
have
to
say
that
it
was
excellent
very
champagnelike
and
kept
very
well
by
the
bsp
which
is
no
surprise
pours
very
pale
with
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
thin
ring
of
head
looks
like
champagne
aromas
of
apple
piepeaches
clove
very
dry
in
the
nose
tastes
of
spicy
apple
pie
cream
and
with
bitter
cherry
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
sparkling
and
creamy
and
has
a
very
dry
finish
absolutely
delightful
not
a
novelty
at
all
a
solid
style
and
solid
representation
of
the
style
pours
just
like
champagne
a
darker
gold
with
a
great
balance
of
bubbles
very
large
head
nose
is
a
gentle
yeast
with
a
slight
sweet
edge
flavor
is
like
a
demisec
champagne
yet
its
beer
sweet
but
an
obvious
though
slight
hop
influence
the
effect
of
being
aged
in
wood
is
noticeably
present
strong
perfume
presence
as
well
feel
is
like
a
good
champagne
drinkable
personally
i
think
when
they
made
this
they
thought
what
would
john
like
unbelievable
my
first
perfectly
rated
beer
if
there
are
any
ways
for
this
to
be
better
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
out
30
for
a
bottle
and
damn
well
worth
it
the
price
of
this
beer
can
skew
your
opinion
because
it
seems
that
it
should
be
beyond
amazing
well
my
feeling
for
this
beer
is
that
the
champagne
process
adds
an
unique
twist
to
the
finish
and
the
way
it
looks
in
the
glass
it
started
out
like
a
typical
belgian
triple
but
a
yeasty
ginger
note
appeared
towards
the
end
i
really
like
the
champagne
like
features
and
the
carbonated
mouthfeel
a
beer
for
celebrating
special
occasions
i
will
say
that
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
pours
like
champagne
highly
carbonated
and
smelling
like
grain
there
is
a
very
thick
head
but
it
settles
quickly
this
brew
hurt
my
mouth
it
tastes
very
metallic
with
grainy
finish
i
am
not
a
big
fan
especially
for
the
price
but
i
put
a
bottle
away
for
the
hell
of
it
i
think
it
is
overrated
i
would
rather
spend
20
bucks
on
some
scaldis
noel
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
the
carbonic
bite
makes
me
think
that
attepmting
to
make
a
champagne
beer
is
nice
but
actually
doing
one
commercially
is
a
bad
idea
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
great
just
as
it
should
be
really
bubbly
and
light
on
the
palate
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
something
that
ill
definitely
be
buying
again
i
like
the
idea
of
having
this
beer
on
hand
for
special
occasionsright
now
im
celebrating
the
fact
that
i
am
done
with
exams
and
stress
for
a
month
or
so
it
is
pricey
i
paid
24
for
this
but
i
think
that
its
worth
it
unless
i
find
another
of
the
same
style
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
very
soon
its
not
cheap
but
if
you
can
find
a
place
to
buy
it
by
the
glass
brick
store
pub
in
decatur
ga
i
highly
highly
recommend
it
its
wonderful
to
just
sit
here
and
enjoy
but
the
hefty
price
tag
in
australia
probably
means
i
wont
buy
it
anytime
soon
it
is
definently
something
i
will
buy
once
a
year
though

smell
is
kind
of
sweet
but
a
malty
sweetness
that
reminds
you
that
this
is
still
beer
also
a
bit
of
mintymedicinal
smell
in
there
too
which
my
friends
didnt
like
but
i
didnt
mind
the
taste
was
similar
with
that
mintymedicinal
flavor
coming
out
again
mouthfeel
was
light
and
dry
with
just
enough
carbonation
not
overdone
i
ended
up
drinking
most
of
the
bottle
since
my
two
friends
didnt
really
like
it
so
you
know
it
is
drinkable
price
is
a
bit
high
and
i
didnt
like
it
enough
to
probably
ever
buy
it
again
but
very
unique
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
definately
better
than
the
freixenet
and
an
awesome
bottle
for
the
collection
the
taste
was
sweet
very
sweet
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
overpowered
every
other
taste
i
had
hoped
to
experience
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
overall
drinkability
was
poor
for
me
for
me
the
beer
is
way
to
sweet
and
i
can
get
much
better
beers
at
better
prices
this
beer
retails
for
nearly
20
a
bottle
i
can
mix
and
awesome
6
for
that
price
overall
a
nice
beer
if
you
like
them
really
sweet
in
flavor
and
really
dry
in
mouthfeel
not
to
my
taste
unfortunately
it
would
probably
go
quite
well
with
sushi
overall
a
very
tastey
and
complex
brew
worth
a
try
for
a
special
occasion
for
sure
but
the
price
26
a
bottle
is
a
bit
much
for
regular
consumption
overall
this
beer
is
great
it
is
all
i
have
expected
from
the
beer
and
the
style
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
if
this
was
any
less
of
a
beer
i
would
have
rated
drinkabilty
very
low
because
of
the
price
tag
but
this
beer
is
just
so
damn
good
its
going
to
be
hard
to
tell
my
girlfriend
that
i
spent
this
much
on
1
single
beer
but
fuck
that
this
stuff
is
amazing
cool
beer
strong
flavorful
bright
classybelgian
when
i
ordered
this
my
server
was
blown
away
apparently
they
dont
sell
it
often
and
it
was
off
limits
for
staff
tasting
so
as
a
ba
i
offered
to
share
a
glass
and
wound
up
having
a
fun
conversation
with
both
my
waiter
and
the
bar
manager
responsible
for
bringing
in
this
treat
dont
let
the
price
tag
scare
you
off
buy
it
for
that
special
occasion
and
enjoy

poured

glass
smell
fruity
with
hint
of
ginger
very
carbonated
sweet
little
spicy
had
been
aged
for
5
years
although
alcohol
is
probably
around
12ish
from
aging
taste
was
not
overpowering
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
of
it
but
i
havent
seen
it
elsewhere
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
miniscule
bubbles
that
appeared
to
be
the
product
of
secondary
fermentation
the
beer
had
a
lemonlime
soda
aroma
that
was
reminiscent
to
me
of
the
squirt
brand
mouthfeel
was
very
chalky
and
rough
in
nature
while
flavor
was
lemony
in
flavor
i
am
not
a
fan
overall
this
one
is
a
definite
special
occasion
beer
and
at
that
i
can
think
of
several
others
id
have
before
this
one
such
as
samiclaus
trap
roch
8
or
10
and
even
dfh
120
minute
the
only
reason
i
sampled
this
beer
is
that
it
was
a
gift
otherwise
it
would
still
be
sitting
on
the
specialty
stores
shelf
as
a
curio
worth
a
try
losing
close
to
half
the
bottle
while
opening
really
pissed
me
off
things
started
badly
however
the
depth
of
flavour
inventivness
and
originality
of
this
beer
really
make
up
for
it
big
belgian
character
with
champagne
mouthfeel
and
brewing
techniques
a
very
good
match
it
seems
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
very
often
due
to
its
high
price
however
its
a
superb
beer
which
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
very
drinkable
for
11
5
however
i
would
suggest
sharing
this
one
with
someone
make
an
occassion
of
it
that
said
would
i
buy
this
again
perhaps
but
not
any
time
soon
if
it
were
around
15
it
would
be
a
regular
purchase
for
me
a
unique
beer
with
a
hefty
price
tag
certainly
worth
it
at
least
once
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
i
like
what
they
were
trying
to
achieve
but
for
my
money
ill
take
a
few
bottles
of
tremens
or
duvel
beef
notes
i
thought
this
might
be
a
little
more
champagnelike
but
im
rather
satisfied
with
the
way
it
is
maybe
not
worth
the
money
but
a
good
beer
to
try
once
and
definitely
one

toast

aroma
of

with
some

taste
was
quite
dry
with
some
nice

presence
and
a
dry
yeasty
finish
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
but
i
guess
that
is
part
of
this
beer
style
even
though
this
beer
packs
a
bit
of
alcohol
i
couldnt
detect
any
alcohol
notes
while
this
beer
was
quite
interesting
and
complex
it
does
confirm
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
champagne
and
even
though
brew
with
beer
ingredient
i
still
dont
dig
the
mouthfeel
edit
much
different
than
miller
high
life
d
it
is
very
unusual
it
is
tasty
but
i
dont
think
i
would
pay
25
for
it
again
unless
it
is
a
very
special
occasion
i
realize
i
am
probably
not
worthy
and
i
will
review
this
beer
with
its
beerstyle
in
mind
ive
had
the
deus
several
times
now
so
i
feel
compelled
to
review
it
it
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
enticing
and
complex
beers
that
i
have
ever
been
exposed
to
the
last
time
i
was
lucky
enough
to
drink
it
from
my
very
own
deus
flute
thanks
mike
nice
gift
it
is
without
a
doubt
the
champagne
of
beers
very
highly
carbonated
and
makes
a
lovely
streaming
cascade
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
just
by
looking
i
could
confuse
it
for
champagne
but
im
no
champagne
expert
actually
i
dont
even
like
champagne
which
make
it
hilarious
that
i
love
this
beer
it
makes
a
great
special
occasion
item
just
like
champagne
the
color
of
this
beer
in
my
flute
is
a
very
pale
straw
color
very
similar
to
an
american
light
larger
but
the
similarities
end
there
the
nose
is
a
sweet
and
musky
scent
but
light
for
those
scents
the
mouthfeel
is
of
course
very
carbonated
and
light
almost
airy
the
taste
is
light
and
dry
with
hints
of
ginger
honey
crisp
fruit
maybe
green
apples
but
not
sour
and
is
very
complex
very
very
nice
expensive
but
well
worth
it
if
you
decide
to
try
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
gentle
explosion
of
incredibly
light
and
airy
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
and
effervescent
fluffy
texture
sensory
overload
pretty
much
sums
up
all
aspects
of
this
brew
the
abv
feelsnot
tastes
more
like
1314
as
it
gently
warms
the
gullet
the
price
tag
is
irrelevent
this
is
bottled
bliss
here
carbonation
explodes
in
the
mouth
followed
by
a
distinctly
concord
grape
flavor
very
effervescent
more
like
a
champagne
than
a
beer
pours
very
pale
yellow
like
faded
straw
with
lots
and
lots
and
lots
and
lots
and
lots
of
very
small
bubbles
looks
well
like
champagne
extremely
carbonated
with
a
large
persistant
head
it
smells
of
bananas
peaches
and
apricots
not
a
whole
lot
to
not
like
there
taste
pepper
up
front
then
the
fruit
comes
on
with
a
hint
of
licorice
very
dry
finish
but
it
comes
off
as
refreshing
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
all
about
the
carbonation
but
it
has
enough
ale
body
to
sustain
it
drinkability
is
excellent
doesnt
really
have
an
alcohol
taste
or
feel
despite
its
prodigious
strength
and
the
dry
finish
is
refreshing
a
winner
for
sure
worth
the
price
i
dont
doubt
the
work
that
goes
into
it
that
the
price
is
justified
but
definitely
not
a
daily
drinker
drinkability
is
quite
good
given
the
strong
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
most
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
a
bottle
would
serve
four
perfectly
in
terms
of
cost
i
cant
really
say
that
it
is
worth
it
but
this
is
one
luxurious
beer
for
sure
cost
aside
this
will
be
a
new
year
celebration
tradition
for
me
cheers
what
a
way
to
celebrate
my
2nd
aniversary
on
beer
advocate
poured
out
a
bright
pale
gold
color
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
creamyfoamy
white
head
that
sat
there
forever
the
nose
offered
some
earthy
and
sweet
malt
notes
hop
bitterness
and
some
funky
yeast
the
taste
had
a
fantastic
balance
of
malt
and
hops
just
leaning
bitter
rounded
by
some
spic
alcohol
that
was
present
without
being
overbearing
the
mouthfeel
was
barely
there
low
carbonation
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
warm
alcoholic
burn
at
the
end
notes
an
amazing
brew
and
an
interesting
style
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
complexity
and
some
really
good
flavors
going
for
it
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
by
far
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
high
for
a
regular
but
this
is
well
worth
picking
up
for
special
occasions
mouthfeel
dry
and
a
little
tart
but
the
carbonation
really
brought
an
exciting
element
to
this
beers
feeling
it
left
on
you
for
being
4
years
old
this
is
still
going
good
could
probably
go
another
4
years
at
26
99
a
bottle
i
dont
think
ill
find
out
though
this
also
paired
really
good
with
some
home
made
meatloaf
overall
an
excellent
experience
and
if
you
can
find
it
for
under
30
get
one
or
two
throw
them
in
a
cellar
or
dont
and
drink
them
immediately
and
let
them
get
even
better
with
age
d
damn
drinkable
this
beer
is
so
damn
good
it
is
worth
the
damn
40
price
tag
bottom
line
its
decent
if
you
are
looking
for
a
tartsour
belgian
with
some
champagnelike
qualities
but
its
not
worth
25
a
bottle
fomr
the
moment
i
opened
and
poured
this
beer
it
screamed
vitality
the
look
the
smell
and
the
flavor
come
together
to
make
it
a
special
event
the
sole
setback
with
the
flavor
for
my
money
is
the
complexity
which
combined
with
its
effervescent
spirit
makes
it
somewhat
of
a
challenge
on
the
palate
still
the
joyous
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
experience
one
other
thing
at
25
per
bottle
it
is
indeed
special
but
im
not
really
sold
on
the

appréciez

opinion
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
having
the
name
flanders
on
it
made
me
instantly
think
that
it
may
have
a
sour
flavor
but
this
wasnt
the
case
i
wouldnt
say
that
i
was
disappointed
about
this
but
it
surprised
me
the
beer
is
really
clean
for
belgian
standards
and
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
up
duvel
as
much
as
anything
it
is
a
beer
that
is
absolutely
worth
a
try
the
price
was
a
bit
steep
at
27
a
bottle
but
when
you
consider
that
this
is
a
750ml
of
12abv
beer
you
can
split
the
price
and
entertain
a
few
friends
with
it
nice
fantastic
stuff
well
worth
the
20can
i
spent
on
it
im
glad
i
held
out
to
sample
it
when
i
was
in
the
right
mood
and
didnt
rush
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
or
aggressive
about
this
beer
whatsoever
it
is
subtle
and
refined
and
has
it
all
in
the
right
places
to
the
proper
degree
in
my
opinion
even
the
abv
isnt
apparent
within
the
taste
it
is
smooth
and
isnt
very
noticable
until
halfway
through
the
bottle
when
it
becomes
apparent
within
the
bloodstream
i
have
many
personal
things
to
celebrate
this
day
and
im
very
happy
to
have
had
this
brut

to
enjoy
it
with
id
definitely
pick
up
more
if
i
came
across
it
again
even
though
this
was
one
of
the
last
bottles
available
i
would
recommend
this
belgium
ale
to
someone
who
has
tried
many
of
this
type
to
fully
appreciate
what
its
up

i

an
intresting
effort
though
in
a
style
i
should
revisit
drinkability
even
considering
the
price
i
would
want
this
again
and
again
so
subtle
and
complex
the
comparison
to
fine
champagne
is
on
the
money
i
think
i
will
get
another
couple
bottles
just
to
hold
onto
for
special
occasions
would
go
great
with
anything
champagne
goes
with
and
more
would
make
an
outstanding
apperitif
highly
recommended

vintage
most
expensive
beer
i
have
drank
at
home
to
date
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
group
tough
to
consume
by
yourself
but
very
interesting
my
palate
will
never
be
the
same
from
the
flavors
and
the
carbonation
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
at
first
but
i
got
to
where
i
thought
it
was
okay
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
thats
all
though
defintely
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
but
it
is
nowhere
i
repeat
nowhere
near
being
worth
the
30
that
i
paid
for
this
bottle
even
for
half
that
price
i
wouldnt
buy
another
i
appreciate
the
process
and
the
labor
that
goes
into
making
this
beer
but
end
the
end
its
still
a
flowerridden
perfumey
brew
with
an
overpowering

me
with

it
put

under

hehe
a
good
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
not
exceptional
but
persistent
well
amalgamated
with
the
moscatolike
sweetness

the

served

cold
into
a
makeshift
flute
pours
crystal
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
volcanous
head
that
rises
like
champagne
yet
more
soft
and
pillowy
and
leaves
exquisite
lacing
honeysuckle
blossoms
and
numerous
other
flowery
peppery
and
dusty
notes
amongst
a
sweet
malt
background
springlike
in
its
bouquet
very
lively
carbonated
which
is
the
key
to
its
drinkability
it
has
a
honeyed
mouthfeel
with
prickly
notes
of
carbonic
acid
dry
yet
malty
and
sweet
fruity
apple
pear
with
peppery
alcohol
notes
some
musty
qualities
about
it
with
hints
of

huskiness
a
delightful
treat
who
says
fizzy
yellow
beer
is
for
wussies
this
beer
has
to
be
judged
in
context
of
its
cost
the
bottle
set
me
back
35
i
saved
it
for
a
special
occaion
getting
a
job
with
my
states
attorney
generals
office
after
a
great
dinner
capped
by
maudite
on
tap
i
came
home
to
this
in
my
fridge
i
opened
it
and
foam
came
gushing
out
after
it
settle
to
a
drinkable
level
i
quaffed
and
wafted
the
smell
was
much
like
a
saison
the
taste
much
like
a
earthy
tripel
nothing
in
particular
jumped
out
at
me
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
but
this
just
didnt
deliver
medium
to
full
bodied
good
drinkability
but
its
not
going
to
draw
many
repeat
buys
at
almost
35
a
bottle
enjoyed
as
a
2oz
sample
at
the
belgian
beer
fest
2004
truly
an
excellent
beer
but
worth
40
a
pop
maybe
pours
a
very
light
yellowclear
color
excellent
head
retention
carbonation
was
predominant
smell
is
potent
sweet
and
alcoholic
my
fellow
ba
charthepirate
finds
this
beer
exceptionally
balanced
yet
i
find
the
biting
alcoholic
taste
to
be
an
overall
detractor
to
the
experience
regardless
this
beer
puts
forth
an
excellent
display
with
cinnamon
flavors
prominent
and
a
floral
background
aftertaste
dissipates
nearly
immediately
overall
delicious
but
pricey
comments

my
special
occasion
for
popping
this
cork
was
review
1300
what
a
treat
to
find
a
new
beerstyle
new
to
me
after
so
many
reviews
ive
seen
the
bottle
in
the
stores
before
but
would
have
never
thought
of
buying
it
was
it
not
for
the
strong
rating
on
beeradvocate
a
great
beer
and
a
great
site
its
fine
belgium
brewing
meets
champagne
its
too
bizarre
to
describe
but
the
taste
will
be
unforgettable
the
experience
was
well
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
but
not
one
i
could
afford
to
drink
week
in
and
week
out
im
not
convinced
a
high
price
tag
automatically
suggests
its
a
premium
brew
in
fact
several
expensive
beers
ive
tried
im
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
hooplas
all
about
deus
is
an
exception
youll
never
find
a
beer
anywhere
else
this
unique
in
texture
smell
and
taste
perhaps
i
didnt
let
this
one
chill
down
enough
but
when
i
popped
the
cork
it
was
geyserville
for
a
good
two
minutes
it
finally
calmed
down
and
i
was
able
to
get
a
decent
pour
very
active
carbonation
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
foamy
2
inch
thinck
head
that
calmed
down
to
a
quarter
inch
champagne
meets
belgium
in
the
aroma
vanilla
clove
merengue
yeast
green
apple
candied
orage
spice
its
worth
noting
that
if
you
follow
serving
intructions
as
written
on
the
bottle
and
serve
this
chilled
to
24
c
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
floral
and
clean
a
plethora
of
flavors
will
come
out
of
nowhere
as
this
warms
up
sweet
malt
honey
apricot
citrus
all
make
an
appearance
along
with
a
subtle
spiciness
the
feel
of
this
is
refreshing
thoughout
with
a
very
fine
moussebubble
structurecarbonation
beautiful
and
highly
drinkable
a
great
beer
well
worth
the
45
paid
and
a
brew
that
could
easily
be
drank
inplace
of
champagne
any
time
even
with
an
abv
of
11
5
got
this
one
for
a
birthday
present
and
like
all
expensive
brews
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
had
a
special
occasion
to
drink
it
then
again
according
to
the
film
sideways
when
you
drink
it
it
is
a
special
occasion
anyway
had
to
have
it
in
a
champagne
flute
and
i
was
well
rewarded
it
poured
with
a
huge
white
fluffy
head
and
a
light
golden
body
with
constant
carbonation
movement
quite
entertaining
really
a
lovely
floral
and
clovelike
nose
precedes
the
indulgence
the
mouthfeel
is
peppery
and
malty
but
is
not
the
essence
of
the
beer
the
lifeline
in
my
humble
opinion
is
the
great
marriage
of
the
floral
and
sugary
essences
truly
wonderful
there
also
is
a
splash
of
orange
zest
that
thusly
adds
to
the
complexity
the
finish
perks
up
with
an
alcohol
presence
that
is
the
foreground
of
a
lemonyorange
and
malty
background
just
a
world
class
beer
the
body
on
this
beer
is
exceptional
it
just
overpowers
your
mouth
with
its
size
this
beer
was
quite
pricey
but
well
worth
the
money
as
it
was
a
style
that
i
really
wanted
to
try
very
impressive
not
an
everyday
drink
based
on
flavors
and
the
price
24
but
a
highly
worthwhile
experience
presentation
packaged
in
a
750ml
dark
green
glass
champagne
bottle
with
cork
and
a
wire
cage
and
foil
closure
served
in
champagne
flutes
though
i
suspect
that
due
to
the
massive
head
volume
a
belgian
goblet
is
a
better
choice
golden
champagne
in
appearance
with
heavy
carbonation
aroma
is
a
blend
of
herbs
spice
and
medicinal
antiseptic
flavor
is
similar
very
dry
not
too
tart
yet
malty
in
flavor
not
very
much
body
to
speak
of
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
overall
impression
for
me
this
was
too
expensive
too
dry
too
champagne
like
i
dont
like
champagne
but
this
smells
better
than
any
champagne
ive
had
im
going
to
be
generous
on
my
score
for
this
section
because
the
beer
is
definitely
within
style
its
just
a
style
i
can
see
myself
not
liking
this
is
extremely
unique
and
very
good
now
this
is
a
beer
worth
its
premium
price
i
can
see
why
they
call
this
biere
de
champagne
because
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
champagnes
ive
had
in
my
life
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
one
isnt
quite
a
brut
and
a
nice
character
however
i
love
the
barley
character
instead
of
the
grapes
certainly
in
any
situation
i
have
to
serve
champagne
hey
im
not
married
yet
this
would
be
one
i
would
put
there
since
this
is
as
good
as
wine
champagnes
that
are
twice
as
much
this
is
one
that
i
certainly
will
have
again
once
my
pockets
deepen
that
is
clear
yellowgold
in
color
huge
volumes
of
carbonation
swirling
around
strangely
the
whitish
head
is
quite
robust
lasting
an
eternity
amazing
lacing
of
the
glass
aromas
tickle
the
nostrils
sorta
like
perfume
crossed
with
an
array
of
citrus
flavor
is
superb
its
hard
to
convince
yourself
that
this
is
beer
your
are
drinking
crackly
carbonation
enhances
the
drenching
of
the
tastebuds
from
the
sugary
sweetness
up
front
smoothing
out
to
a
more
pronounced
pepperyhop
bite
in
the
middle
and
finishes
with
a
honeyglazed
orange
spice
zip
dry
hell
yes
simply
an
amazing
creation
2001
bottle
hold
the
foam
batman
geez
this
thing
foams
almost
as
bad
as
an
adam
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
lots
of
puffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
takes
forever
to
pour
a
glass
nice
golden
color
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
yeasty
with
a
lot
of
lemon
character
the
flavor
is
very
spicy
and
yeasty
as
well
as
i
expect
most
good
belgians
to
be
has
a
crisp
lemony
zing
i
couldnt
detect
the
alcohol
very
well
until
after
drinking
it
so
its
pretty
well
masked
great
drinkability
well
overall
this
beer
is
very
different
definitely
champagne
like
would
i
get
this
again
probably
not
at
23
a
bottle
but
it
is
worth
a
try
served
in
a
deus
tulip
this
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
and
makes
a
tall
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruit
and
fresh
cut
flowers
very
complex
flavor
with
notes
of
alcohol
lemon
honey
and
bread
dough
medium
bodied
bubbly
carbonation
and
finishes
rather
dry
i
enjoyed
it
although
it
was
quite
pricey
what
an
intriguing
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
transparent
golden
color
with
just
tons
of
light
fluffy
head
everywhere
we
had
to
pour
and
wait
multiple
times
the
nose
was
very
tart
almost
gueuzelike
with
lots
of
lemony
citrus
in
there
the
taste
is
fairly
different
from
the
nose
theres
some
of
hte
lemon
in
there
but
there
was
something
that
reminded
me
of
a
soapyness
but
it
wasnt
bad
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
that
i
was
tasting
the
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
moderately
thick
and
very
sprightly
for
a
big
beer
the
alcohol
was
not
apparent
at
all
except
to
my
head
i
was
glad
this
was
split
3
ways
a
huge
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
gem
sweet
and
candylike
with
many
passion
fruit
notes
along
with
notes
of
black
peppers
honey
melon
and
peach
the
finish
is
very
dry
poorly
hidden
alcohol
not
all
its
cracked
up
to
be
im
glad
i
got
this
for
free
thick
foamy
head
denser
than
for
champagne
and
lasting
which
is
good
for
the
appearance
and
for
the
mouthfeel
a
crazy
level
of
carbonation
is
observable
in
the
clear
golden
color
body
fruity
smell
of
sweet
peaches
and
a
vendanges
tardives
aspect
should
i
write
this
review
in
french
yeasty
and
doughy
but
aired
and
subtle
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
fine
white
wine
but
sweeter
and
nicely
fruity
with
very
light
herbal
notes
of
hops
and
citric
notes
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
is
round
and
not
as
dry
as
for
champagne
which
i
found
great
full
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
the
high
carbonation
nicely
chewy
with
some
interesting
notes
of
liquorice
in
the
end
and
hints
of
cloves
and
cinammon
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
very
original
brew
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
i
am
happy
that
the
exorbitant
price
equated
to
oneof
the
finest
beers
i
have
ever
tried
pours
a
fivefinger
white
bubbly
head
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
strong
carbonation
pour
slow
medium
bodied
nose
is
sweet
and
spicey
starts
and
finishes
sweet
with
spices
very
smooth
the
high
abv
is
not
really
noticeable
i
had
to
pause
before
buying
one
of
these
but
it
was
for
our
anniversary
soooo
35
00
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
to
be
honest
most
belgian
beers
are
good
and
you
can
get
an
equally
good
one
for
30
less
bottle
provided
by
kimchee
in
our
tasting
with
tiggmtl
martint
and
oakes
appearance
is
neat
highly
carbonated
pale
blond
with
a
generous
white
head
aroma
is
mineralic
nice
at
first
but
becoming
dull
and
off
as
it
warms
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
this
they
say
to
drink
this
cold
ill
ensure
to
try
it
cold
with
a
next
bottle
but
for
now
something
like
a
cleaning
product
develops
in
the
warming
aroma
something
like
the
yellow
of
the
egg
too
sweet
powder
sugar
is
added
to
the
melting
with
a
leafy
and
spicy
counterparts
that
would
actually
appear
well
blended
without
the
phenomenon
stated
above
in
mouth
theres
a
spritzy
dryness
but
not
as
intense
as
a
champaigns
and
theres
definitely
still
lots
of
sweetness
getting
through
lemony
flavors
moderate
alcohol
but
still
well
hidden
for
11
5
theres
a
slight
bitterness
that
seems
slightly
off
and
once
again
as
it
warms
theres
a
dusty
plastic
flavor
i
dont
enjoy
at
all
nevertheless
its
extremely
original
flowery
and
initially
pleasant
so
i
assume
this
bla
bla
about
drinking
it
cold
is
to
be
taken
seriously
mouthfeel
is
fabulous
though
indeed
champaigny
heavily
carbonated
slightly
astringent
im
definitely
not
buying
another
bottle
though
as
good
as
it
looks
ive
paid
more
for
porn
movies
and
this
is
that
same
sort
of
gratification
only
for
other
senses
an
a
in
my
book
it
was
good
but
the
drinkability
is
bad
because
of
the
overcarbonation
golden
straw
in
color
thick
big
bubbles
with
a
medium
thick
lace
flowery
nose
of
spring
and
spice
and
you
can
definatly
pick
up
a
slight
saffron
nose
richepperfecent
semisweet
mouthfeel
but
only
upfront
then
tapers
back
to
light
flowers
on
your
tongue
definatly
better
than
last
years
well
the
question
lately
has
been
variations
of
is
this
beer
worth
xx
dollars
or
how
much
would
you
pay
for
deus
this
beer
is
worth
the
2025
for
celebrating
a
big
occasion
birthday
anniversary
etc
it
has
one
of
the
most
unique
flavors
ive
come
across
yet
that
said
i
still
wouldnt
want
it
all
the
time
even
if
i
could
afford
it
the
beer
as
is
emigrates
from
the
750ml
green
corked
bottle
to
my
belgian
triple
glass
a
luminous
and
limpid
gold
color
the
head
brobdingnagian
in
size
effervescent
and
bright
white
in
color
the
lace
as
the
head
dissipates
a
velum
like
curtain
to
obscure
the
glass
the
aroma
of
over
ripe
granny
smith
apples
earthy
sweet
malt
at
the
back
somewhat
acerbic
with
the
start
sweet
and
nice
malt
presence
the
finish
is
ferine
in
its
acidity
the
hops
inconspicuous
with
the
aftertaste
desert
dry
slightly
vinous
and
quite
long
lasting
id
say
its
better
than
most
of
the
blonde
belgians
ive
tasted
and
well
worth
a
sample
and
the
11
5
percent
abv
seems
well
hidden
accept
for
the
light
tummy
warming
sensation
but
good
as
it
may
be
i
can
think
of
many
belgians
id
rather
spend
30
00
on
duvel
for
5
99
a
bottle
i
love
trader
joes
you
said
yellow
slow
didnt
you
say
it
again
this
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
biere
de
garde
i
once
had
its
a
nice
gold
body
with
a
good
white
head
and
streaming
effervescence
the
aroma
is
strong
and
sharp
with
an
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
lemonheads
not
lemon
since
the
candy
doesnt
really
taste
like
lemons
its
almost
like
the
beer
has
herbs
added
with
a
faint
herbal
nature
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
its
fairly
dry
and
the
malt
is
pilsnerlike
this
is
a
classic
belgian
ale
with
an
identity
crisis
it
is
a
pale
golden
ale
with
a
tight
foamy
head
and
flavors
typical
of
many
belgian
ales
but
there
also
are
hints
of
grape
apple
and
peach
from
the
long
bottle
conditioning
hints
of
plum
and
a
little
grassiness
also
come
through
well
this
has
certainly
lived
up
to
the
hype
this
is
a
killer
alternative
to
champagne
and
even
at
this
price
it
is
a
steal
you
cant
find
champagen
at
this
price
that
will
compare
to
the
complexity
of
this
beer
best
brew
ive
had
in
the
last
year
i
think
we
were
sitting
in
the
pub
one
night
and
saw
this
pricey
buy
on
the
list
well
being
curious
ones
we
went
up
to
the
bar
and
asked
if
this
beer
truly
was
worth
its
weight
instead
of
a
yeah
or
nay
we
were
given
this
glorious
description
of
wonderous
champagne
style
beer
and
its
crisp
excellence
we
were
sold
and
headed
back
to
the
table
with
our
champagne
style
beer
in
its
large
bottle
this
is
a
fun
beer
that
is
what
comes
to
mind
its
very
light
and
effervescent
with
a
zillion
nice
biting
bubbles
it
was
crisp
and
clean
and
well
like
champagne
mated
with
a
nice
pale
ale
nice
little
lemon
and
slight
floral
taste
but
not
over
powering
this
isnt
an
everyday
beer
but
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
a
classy
change
to
new
years
champagne
or
special
occasion
this
beer
is
definitely
pushing
the
envelope
i
think
its
really
unlike
any
other
drink
ive
had
the
alcohol
is
quite
strong
and
the
spicyherby
flavor
is
either
interesting
or
offputting
for
me
interesting
it
makes
an
intriguing
substitute
for
champagne
but
id
still
choose
any
good
standard
belgian
ale
over
this
hybrid
wow
this
beer
looks
like
champagne
inside
and
out
with
a
golden
yellow
color
and
hundreds
of
small
tight
white
bubbles
the
nose
is
herbal
with
some
faint
apple
and
spice
the
taste
is
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
tasted
there
is
a
teaminty
undertone
and
body
deceivingly
thin
and
drinkable
bought
at
beverage
bistro
com
looking
at
this
from
a
homebrewers
perspective
im
going
to
clone
this
puppy
wonderfully
drinkable
deus
serves
as
a
great
apertif
with
its
complexity
liveliness
and
champagnelike
appeal
this
is
a
special
beer
worthy
of
the
hype
and
a
joy
to
savor
a
delicate
yet
potent
brew
with
a
mouthfeel
of
very
light
syrup
smooth
and
sharp
easy
to
drink
impressions
are
of
a
fine
white
belgian
alechampaign
hybrid
this
beer
poured
a
very
light
golden
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
the
aroma
is
a
heavy
mix
of
citrus
spices
and
almost
candy
like
elements
the
flavor
is
of
citrus
and
a
slight
butter
aspect
to
it
this
butter
like
texture
is
also
apparent
in
the
finish
which
is
quite
sprite
due
in
part
to
the
carbonation
is
it
worth
the
20
dollars
i
spent
on
it
of
course
not
but
then
many
of
the
dogfish
are
overpriced
in
my
opinion
and
why
should
they
have
all
the
fun
with
experimentation
if
these
belgians
wanted
to
do
a
champagne
style
great
for
them
now
just
make
something
in
a
saner
price
range
i
humbly
bow
before
the
beer
gods
for
they
have
graced
us
with
another
great
one
here
and
many
thanks
to
putnam
for
sharing
some
of
this
treasure
to
sum
up
this
beer
is
like
butterflavored
mousse
that
melts
into
a
complex
of
earthy
honeyripe
fruit
flavors
other
after
the
brewing
process
is
complete
and
the
beer
is
bottled
with
yeast
added
to
the
bottle
for
another
fermentation
this
beer
is
then
shipped
to
the
champagne
region
of
france
to
undergo
the
full
methode
champagnoise
sp
the
bottles
are
positioned
neck
down
and
allowed
to
remain
that
way
for
long
enough
for
the
yeast
to
settle
at
the
bottom
of
the
neck
then
the
bottle
is
dipped
in
liquid
nitrogen
the
portion
of
the
neck
that
contains
the
yeast
plug
is
broken
off
the
bottle
is
then
recorked
and
caged
then
sent
out
to
your
loving
arms
above
is
paraphrased
from
steven
beaumonts
little
spiel
about
this
beer
first
we
moved
this
brew
form
the
fridge
to
the
freezer
to
get
it
cold
like
they
said
on
the
bottle
after
12
hour
it
was
removed
uncorked
with
a
big
pop
and
poured
it
poured
a
large
head
of
creamy
fine
white
bubbles
and
a
very
carbonated
weak
straw
yellow
body
the
head
leaves
a
clinging
vine
lacing
its
aroma
was
a
bit
different
and
mild
neither
malt
nor
hop
almost
kind
of
skunky
my
first
thought
of
the
taste
was
yuck
a
second
sip
revieled
a
bit
more
character
it
was
very
spicey
with
clove
and
licorice
after
a
few
sips
the
burps
from
the
fizzy
carbonation
began
to
set
in
i
then
let
it
warm
up
as
i
continued
to
finish
the
mug
i
had
poured
with
well
over
a
half
a
bottle
left
at
this
point
i
had
rated
it
436212
a
2
7
overall
after
letting
it
warm
up
it
did
not
get
any
better
complex
it
is
but
after
the
rochefort
8
we
had
earlier
its
really
hard
to
live
up
to
it
this
is
not
a
brew
i
would
reccommend
especially
for
the
30
it
cost
me
for
1
bottle
first
of
all
in
my
opinion
this
brew
is
way
overpriced
to
say
the
least
because
i
do
not
feel
it
is
all
that
great
of
a
brew
it
poured
a
large
white
invigorating
foamy
head
and
there
was
not
that
much
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
being
spicy
fruity
and
a
slight
clove
aroma
there
was
carbonation
observed
and
the
body
was
a
pale
yellow
the
taste
of
this
brew
was
fizzy
and
tingly
which
is
not
much
to
my
liking
when
it
comes
to
taste
i
was
not
impressed
to
say
the
least
and
the
cost
is
way
out
of
line
in
my
personal
opinion
even
if
i
really
really
liked
this
brew
i
would
still
say
that
it
is
way
overpriced
the
bottle
blew
like
a
land
mine
covered
the
sink
and
one
side
of
the
fridge
hazy
bright
peach
from
the
final
yeast
pitch
the
4th
head
flattens
to
less
than
an
18
of
an
inch
after
the
spurting
released
the
primary
carbonation
decent
string
laces
spicy
aroma
huge
amounts
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
associated
sweetness
a
little
bit
of
model
paint
phenolic
whiffs
as
well
tealike
and
steeped
in
associated
flavors
clove
and
ginger
lots
of
nutmeg
predominate
with
a
black
pepper
bite
up
front
finishes
with
a
bitter
datelike
and
apricot
liquor
cordial
impression
and
a
fully
rounded
aftertaste
decided
body
overall
sense
of
alcohol
and
huge
amounts
of
reminders
of
the
sip
survives
low
temperatures
very
well
very
nice
complex
without
an
obvious
hop
big
wish
the
bottle
didnt
blow
i
may
have
jostled
it
too
much
i
missed
out
on
about
14
of
the
volume
here
minnesota
we
should
all
take
advantage
of
this
beers
availability
the
distributor
is
shaky
and
stores
like
thomas
liquors
only
have
six
well
five
on
hand
if
ever
a
beer
was
lascivous
this
is
it
time
for
that
cold
shower
now
all
in
all
a
beautiful
smooth
sparkling
ale
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
but
will
rarely
buy
again
because
of
the
price
theres
too
many
comparable
brews
at
13
the
price
overall
this
comes
off
more
like
large
fermented
cider
or
cheap
bubbly
than
a
classic
brut
bier
listed
as
a
biere
brut
i
dont
quite
get
that
here
not
as
dry
and
clean
as
it
should
be
to
meet
that
style
guideline
but
it
is
plenty
well
carbonated
my
problem
here
is
that
the
green
bottle
has
allowed
this
to
get
skunk
on
the
nose
i
only
loosely
get
the
belgian
yeast
through
the
stench
not
nice
in
taste
i
get
a
little
better
vibe
but
its
gone
off
not
sure
how
long
these
bottles
have
been
sitting
but
for
18
bucks
a
pop
buyer
beware
that
unless
this
has
been
kept
dark
its
likely
skunked
as
well
i
can
see
the
potential
of
the
fresh
beer
though
and
respect
what
it
might
have
been
light
white
wheat
malt
dry
belgian
yeast
and
effervescent
bubbles
a
refreshing
summertime
toaster
worthy
of
celebrations
in
its
current
form
its
ruined
hard
to
get
a
fair
take
on
this
with
my
specimen
will
revisit
at
some
point
o
this
beer
has
very
good
drinkability
because
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
i
liked
how
it
exhibited
both
fruity
and
dry
flavors
o
i
dont
know
about
this
one
its
ok
seems
different
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
and
in
some
respects
doesnt
seem
much
like
beer
not
bad
though
didnt
expect
this
really
nice
for
its
dirt
cheap
price
probably
because
it
was
expired
nope
no
problems
with
that
here
bottle
poured
a
light
dirty
beige
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
pongy
rustic
malt
with
light
tart
undertones
is
quite
sublime
taste
is
also
a
great
mix
of
rustic
malt
with
dry
brett
notes
with
light
funky
yeast
and
some
pungent
notes
also
noticeable
body
is
quite
full
with
super
great
carbonation
a
perfect
mix
of
complexity
and
drinkability
which
appears
to
be
a
common
thread
form
this
brewery
the
taste
is
initially
good
but
grows
tiresome
fruits
and
yeast
clash
a
bit
i
would
have
slotted
this
under
the
biere
de
champagne
style
if
you
like
the
sound
of
belgianstyle
pale
ale
and
dry
prosecco
then
panil
enhanced
final
is
the
beer
for
you
and
to
be
sure
its
one
of
the
only
such
beers
in
existence
me
personally
i
liked
it
a
lot
its
nearly
worth
the
stains
it
left
on
my
kitchen
wall
considering
it
costs
only
as
much
as
the
cheapest
sparkling
wine
and
is
far
more
special
consider
this
a
must
buy
o
a
great
twist
on
the
traditional
belgian
pale
offering
up
a
nice
tart
flavour
that
pairs
nicely
but
the
volcano
aspect
was
rather
disappointing
im
wondering
if
the
bottle
wouldve
been
ok
had
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
since
ive
known
some
beers
whose
heavy
carbonation
settled
as
it
warmed
up
in
any
case
a
worthy
brew
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
what
was
left
of
the
bottle
o
overall
i
quite
like
it
not
a
typical
style
but
a
nice
use
of
wine
yeast
though
almost
falls
too
much
into
being
like
a
wine
even
if
i
would
assume
there
is
no
grapes
in
it
o
definitely
a
sipping
beer
very
thick
and
sticky
sweet
i
would
suggest
drinking
this
with
dessert
something
sweet
to
cut
the
crazy
sweetness
of
this
beer
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
but
the
sweetness
steals
the
show
45
taste
passionfruit
orange
juice
apricot
vanilla
and
malt
hides
the
13
alcohol
quite
well
kind
of
like
a
wine
cooler
reminds
me
of
smirnoff
ice
a
very
interesting
historical
brew
this
brew
is
a
champaigne
style
brewed
wine
served
as
a
way
for
the
brewery
to
offer
a
wine
like
product
without
requiring
a
special
wines
sales
license
the
brew
is
very
good
it
is
lighter
than
a
pils
and
has
flavor
of
peach
and
eldberry
not
exactly
a
malt
beverage
like
a
zima
a
more
balanced
flavor
and
certainly
crisper
this
will
mix
with
almost
anything
except
milk
products
served
cold
from
the
tap
in
a
fluted
glass
it
is
a
tasty
complement
to
a
light
meal
the
feel
is
light
to
the
mouth
no
bite
or
sting
on
the
palette
easy
to
quaff
and
does
not
sit
heavy
once
consummed
o
i
was
so
excited
to
find
this
unique
beer
and
it
does
not
disappoint
ive
seen
many
use
this
for
a
beermosa
and
that
sounds
excellent
this
is
a
fine
piece
of
work
to
convince
snobby
wine
connoisseurs
that
beer
can
indeed
stand
beside
the
best
wines
and
champagnes
brava
light
and
full
bodied
at
the
same
time
like
a
champange
and
beer
mix
good
from
what
i
have
heard
it
is
only
1
batch
a
year
so
get
out
there
and
pick
it
up
or
trade
for
it
texas
weather
damn
fine
stuff
go
get
you
some
cheers
ohave
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
quite
some
time
its
very
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
spend
the
money
on
a
whole
bottle
o
sweeter
than
expected
and
with
a
larger
malt
body
the
yeast
complexity
is
nice
maybe
a
brut
version
would
tickle
my
fancy
a
little
more
but
as
it
stands
this
aint
bad
great
brew
been
staring
at
this
for
a
year
and
pulled
the
trigger
17
a
bottle
iscreeping
toward
my
top
end
but
boy
is
this
worth
it
complex
and
well
crafted
and
drinkable
at
11
only
other
one
of
this
style
ive
had
is
infinium
by
sam
adams
sa
is
absolute
sewage
compared
to
this
and
actually
is
more
expensive
than
this
seek
this
trade
for
this
try
this
8
710
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a
biere
de
champagne
if
youve
never
had
one
they
are
definitely
very
saisonish
but
with
champagne
yeast
characteristics
instead
of
belgian
yeast
characteristics
very
little
in
the
way
of
earthiness
black
pepper
etc
i
hope
i
described
that
correct
just
giving
my
impression
amazing
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
in
this
one
this
has
to
be
the
easiest
drinking
11
beer
ive
ever
had
flavors
are
well
rounded
body
isnt
overly
heavy
and
there
is
zero
alcohol
sting
seriously
good
easily
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
tried
infinium
but
i
think
this
is
way
better
the
execution
here
is
excellent
and
drinking
this
is
a
real
treat
if
not
a
beer
for
everyday
what
an
amazing
specimen
we
have
here
if
there
was
any
doubt
that
the
united
states
was
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
drink
beer
this
fine
example
of
our
product
should
surely
help
displace
it
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
despite
the
higher
price
and
premium
branding
this
comes
across
as
worse
than
many
macro
lagers
what
little
flavour
there
is
will
not
reward
you
unworthy
of
your
time
or
money
give
it
a
miss
first
try
with
the
style
and
even
with
that
it
seems
a
bit
thin
still
very
drinkable
and
i
could
see
it
pairing
with
many
foods
drinkability
did
what
i
wanted
it
to
do
clean
off
strong
flavors
between
portions
of
the
meal
and
really
is
a
beer
which
does
seem
to
really
borrow
from
champagne
the
yeast
it
uses
does
show
through
in
this
beer
this
is
a
highly
carbonated
beer
its
not
fizzy
water
it
has
flavor
and
its
good
but
its
unusual
i
would
have
had
another
with
the
meal
had
it
been
offered
but
really
one
is
okay
and
its
enough
as
well
not
too
good
really
dissapointing
from
a
nicely
bottled
good
sounding
and
decent
selling
beer
note
champagnelike
but
the
flavors
arent
that
great
ok
for
showing
what
the
style
is
like
but
not
a
great
beer
although
this
beer
was
mediocre
the
style
intrigues
and
excites
me
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
first
of
all
1
99
and
they
couldnt
spring
for
brown
glass
bah
i
must
say
though
it
looks
like
a
million
bucks
most
people
could
probably
be
easily
tricked
into
thinking
its
champagne
same
pale
yellow
same
streams
of
bubbles
same
frothy
fizzy
fleeting
white
head
surprisingly
it
actually
smells
a
bit
like
champagne
too
it
has
a
mustyyetfruity
quality
and
in
fact
it
smells
more
like
champagne
than
beer
delicately
fruity
and
vinous
with
a
mild
apple
sweetness
and
lemon
bitterness
bonedry
and
very
light
in
terms
of
flavor
this
tastes
like
some
kind
of
weird
shandytype
concoction
made
from
stella
brut
champagne
and
club
soda
but
what
it
lacks
in
impact
and
depth
it
makes
up
for
with
sheer
clarity
and
refreshment
this
beer
is
interesting
in
that
it
is
very
unique
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
uninteresting
in
that
it
is
bland
bland
bland
d
this
beer
sucks
looks
and
feels
good
if
thats
the
kind
of
beer
you
like
here
you
go
just
be
prepated
for
a
skunky
void
of
flavor
d
once
drinkable
i
think
you
should
try
it
mouthfeel
could
very
well
be
compared
to
champagne
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
and
sharp
carbonation
the
yeast
is
what
makes
this
beer
and
perhaps
the
process
im
not
sure
costwise
the
yeast
shouldnt
have
any
bearing
so
it
must
be
process
which
i
also
question
but
honestly
it
doesnt
really
come
off
as
anything
more
than
a
very
well
done
and
softlybitter
pilsner
and
thats
allowing
the
flawed
aroma
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
but
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
cost
coors
it
is
a
very
different
beer
that
went
well
with
my
complex
meal
i
would
have
it
again
with
spicy
food
and
certain
meals
but
would
not
pound
this
beer
at
a
bar
dont
bother
overall
good
looks
is
all
that
this
beer
has
i
have
to
admit
this
was
the
first
bière
de
champagne
i
tried
in
contrary
to
what
i
read
in
other
reviews
the
one
i
bought
was
quite
cheap
less
than
1
5
euros
for
the
bottle
an
interesting
creation
a
bit
too
much
like
a
thin
watery
macro
light
in
feel
except
for
the
carbonation
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
not
everything
is
those
who
like
malt
duck
and
the
like
but
are
looking
for
a
beer
like
beverage
of
pedigree
may
find
happiness

a
fancy
champagne
lager
that
is
too
plain
for
its
own
good
ive
never
had
a
biere
brut
before
so
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
effectively
judge
this
beer
against
its
style
well
the
beer
looks
a
lot
like
an
actual
champagne
but
its
rather
unexciting
in
my
eyes
small
bubbles
rise
in
very
pale
golden
liquid
theres
essentially
no
head
after
a
few
seconds
in
much
the
manner
of
champagne
it
could
be
sparkling
apple
cider
a
light
one
with
this
pale
of
a
color
the
aroma
is
fairly
plain
but
good
lager
there
are
some
tart
green
apple
notes
floating
about
i
guess
i
just
expect
more
out
of
this
style
ill
have
to
come
back
and
raise
the
score
if
i
try
a
few
more
and
theyre
much
like
this
one
the
flavor
is
plain
but
good
light
lager
with
more
tart
apple
notes
there
is
some
light
belgian
fruitiness
and
a
dry
finish
its
all
very
close
to
plain
jane
lager
with
the
pleasure
of
champagne
yeast
thrown
into
the
mix
its
certainly
not
worth
the
high
price
tag
which
is
of
course
the
one
thing
preventing
me
from
trying
two
or
three
more
examples
of
this
style
im
thankful
that
i
could
buy
a
single
330ml
bottle
and
didnt
waste
my
money
on
a
full
750ml
or
whatever
they
sell
scaldis
prestige
or
deus
with
their
exorbitant
price
tags
ill
be
buying
this
style
by
the
glass
in
the
future
anyway
for
a
review
of
this
beer
just
look
at
natural
light
then
put
money
signs
around
it
and
think
about
what
you
have
this
beer
is
the
marketing
miracle
of
the
century
no
depth
complexity
or
for
that
matter
merit
to
its
outrageous
price
kasteel
cru
is
extremely
light
and
refreshing
the
color
is
pale
gold
with
heavy
carbonation
that
causes
a
wonderful
head
that
is
reminiscent
of
champagne
it
is
a
very
delicate
beer
with
very
little
hops
and
a
dry
sweet
finish
i
think
that
the
flavor
starts
like
a
beer
but
finishes
like
a
champagne
kasteel
cru
is
an
exceptionally
pale
straw
colour
but
is
perfectly
clear
i
may
have
been
drinking
this
out
of
completely
the
wrong
type
of
glass
in
using
a
tulip
glass
but
it
served
to
highlight
the
fact
that
there
are
few
aromas
to
be
had
from
the
beer
aside
from
some
faint
yeastiness
however
not
unpleasant
at
all
the
taste
is
similarly
on
the
minimal
side
but
some
pleasing
floral
and
yeasty
notes
and
very
crisp
good
taste
for
what
it
is
and
no
sour
aftertaste
the
beer
is
not
excessively
fizzy
while
perfectly
drinkable
after
one
youll
probably
be
wanting
to
try
something
different
d
id
find
it
hard
to
drink
regularly
or
even
another
bottle
kind
of
bland
3
m2
d
nicely
carbonated
not
crisp
but
clean
enough
on
the
mouthfeel
alas
the
flavour
is
almost
too
restrained
to
be
enjoyable
amongst
only
few
socalled
champagne
beers
ive
tasted
this
one
by
far
is
the
least
impressive
pours
a
very
pale
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
champagne
like
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
nothingness
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistant
a
touch
of
grain
and
some
white
grape
sweetness
the
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
definitely
has
champagne
characteristics
the
flavor
is
of
white
grapes
a
very
light
hint
of
honey
and
the
champagne
yeast
strain
similar
to
a
macro
or
euro
lager
but
without
the
adjuncty
flavors
the
feel
is
light
but
not
exactly
watery
softer
carbonation
than
expected
and
finishes
slightly
tart
a
hohum
brew
with
no
exciting
flavors
however
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
change
up
brew
d
reminiscent
of
a
macro
lager
in
many
ways
very
bland
and
disappointing
other
comments
interesting
idea
even
though
it
was
basically
stolen
from
belgium
but
a
rather
insipid
beer
tastes
like
a
waterdown
eurolager
with
a
dash
of
shampagne
looks
were
very
deceiving
with
this
one
an
odd
one
not
particularly
exciting
dr
hides
its
5
abv
quite
well
but
is
ultimately
too
expensive
for
its
quality
and
simplicity
to
justify
a
purchase
its
more
a
rosechampagne
sparkling
wannabe
than
a
true
beer
overall
a
cracking
style
of
beer
that
has
some
legs
my
second
beer
in
this
style
the
other
being
this
beers
sister
and
i
am
not
impressed
the
two
ive
had
are
on
the
weaker
and
cheaper
side
of
the
style
so
maybe
im
being
unfair

overall
finally
a
pleasant
sour
from
side
project
lots
of
grape
but
not
that
intense
on
the
sour
o
delicious
stuff
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
continue
to
expect
this
level
of
excellence
from
side
project
because
they
keep
delivering
these
hits
one
after
another
serving
type
bottle
very
acetic
almost
impossible
to
swallow
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
bright
effervescent
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
is
lemon
citrus
stone
fruit
funk
yogurt
taste
is
essentially
like
a
light
white
sparkling
wine
with
tart
yogurt
intermixed
lots
of
white
grape
peach
apple
pear
with
a
creamy
yogurty
sourness
really
tastes
like
a
fruit
on
the
bottom
yogurt
cup
the
mouthful
is
rich
and
creamy
while
the
carbonation
keeps
it
light
outstanding
beer
my
biggest
issue
with
fuzzy
is
that
the
subtle
sweetness
of
the
white
peaches
were
drowned
out
by
the
intense
yogurty
sourness
blueberry
flanders
had
a
nice
balanced
refreshing
tartness
but
the
blueberry
flavor
was
a
bit
disappointing
this
is
a
much
better
balance
for
my
taste
than
both
a
best
of
both
worlds
probably
my
favorite
sp
so
far
get
it
today
the
most
underrated
of
the
sp
brews
big
white
grape
flavor
and
the
white
wine
barrel
flavor
on
the
end
is
exquisite
a
joy
to
drink
very
surprised
that
the
abv
is
so
darn
high
for
what
it
drinks
like
however
generally
covered
by
too
much
tart
qualities
and
i
much
preferred
jks
blanc
du
bois
in
a
side
by
side
better
than
fuzzy
and
much
better
than
fencerow
in
my
opinion
overall
this
was
way
different
than
i
expected
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
winelike
drinking
experience
given
the
name
ingredients
and
style
with
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
tremendous
beer
if
you
are
a
sour
fan
this
offers
a
great
juicy
sourness
in
addition
to
some
great
complexity
from
the
yeast
and
barrel
aging
cory
killed
it
with
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
dull
sunset
like
golden
yellow
with
no
head
visible
carbonation
and
with
some
careful
pouring
no
sediment
the
nose
has
a
slightly
floralvanilla
grain
barrel
sweetness
surprisingly
limited
tartness
underlying
grape
notes
and
minimal
funkacetone
it
has
a
mild
champagnelike
grape
taste
upfront
with
grain
rounding
out
profile
and
lingering
alcohol
and
oak
the
beer
has
a
lightmedium
body
but
is
not
as
crushable
as
expected
mainly
due
to
the
alcohol
content
and
a
slightly
chewy
sweetness
carbonation
is
relatively
low
and
acidity
is
lower
than
expected
the
beer
still
finishes
with
that
punishing
dry
oak
slap
in
the
palate
the
beers
so
limited
and
expensive
that
id
probably
avoid
purchasing
it
again
in
the
future
or
at
least
my
full
allotment
but
its
undeniably
delicious
verdict
a
very
interesting
beer
from
side
project
much
like
fuzzy
the
nose
was
immaculate
capturing
the
perfect
essence
of
chardonnay
grapes
and
white
wine
but
the
flavors
are
crippled
by
how
sour
the
beer
is
and
while
enjoyable
difficult
to
handle
more
than
a
few
ounces
the
abv
was
expertly
hidden
which
was
a
nice
touch
but
still
the
overwhelming
acidic
sourness
is
hard
to
get
past
the
best
wine
grape
sour
that
i
have
had
100th
style
unfortunately
the
bottle
is
4
years
old
and
didnt
hold
up
well
as
someone
who
drinks
a
lot
of
wine
as
well
as
beer
this
was
a
phenomenal
experience
pours
hazy
golden
orange
with
lingering
bits
of
carbonation
sitting
on
top
smell
is
orange
rind
and
other
citrus
and
bready
champagne
yeast
very
floral
on
the
nose
as
well
the
first
taste
is
all
orange
and
yeast
subdued
and
balanced
flavor
which
i
think
is
what
gets
the
beer
its
low
rating
from
the
majority
of
bas
however
this
isnt
a
beer
thats
supposed
to
slap
you
in
the
face
with
hops
or
dark
chocolate
or
bourbon
flavor
its
supposed
to
showcase
the
yeast
this
is
a
rich
floral
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
really
nothing
overwhelmingly
negative
to
it
the
price
wasnt
an
issue
for
me
because
it
was
free
at
a
friends
house
for
a
small
party
if
youve
ever
had
a
grand
cru
champagne
in
your
life
you
would
appreciate
this
beer
if
you
just
look
past
the
price
tag
you
would
appreciate
this
beer
if
you
store
and
open
the
bottle
correctly
you
would
appreciate
this
beer
another
overpriced
product
from
samuel
adams
which
has
the
look
and
thats
about
it
not
good
infinium
has
a
bright
goldenorange
appearance
with
noticeable
carbonation
as
the
bubbles
rise
in
the
champagne
glass
i
poured
this
in
medicinal
aroma
mixed
with
some
green
apple
and
maybe
some
tropical
fruits
strange
almost
chemical
like
flavor
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
and
seems
much
stronger
than
the
listed
10
produces
an
almost
burning
sensation
on
the
tongue
as
the
carbonation
comes
to
the
forefront
very
disappointing
collaboration
between
2
normally
strong
breweries
serving
type
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
not
sure
why
people
hate
this
one
so
much
i
had
it
on
a
special
occasion
so
maybe
i
am
biased
but
i
really
liked
it
aside
from
the
booze
and
the
yeasty
weirdness
this
was
more
than
decent
numbers
added
from
notes
unfortunately
the
only
other
notes
were
disappointment
and
banana
smell
does
not
work
very
well
with
the
champagne
yeast
i
am
surprised
that
other
reviewers
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
this
is
the
first
bière
de
champagne
that
i
can
remember
drinking
and
i
personally
really
enjoyed
the
style
it
is
very
sweet
but
i
thought
the
sweetness
was
well
complemented
and
balanced
by
the
champagnetype
mouthfeel
which
made
this
go
down
easy
for
me
even
with
the
high
alcohol
and
made
the
beer
stand
out
from
others
im
not
even
a
huge
fan
of
champagne
but
this
beer
seemed
to
me
to
combine
the
best
of
both
champagne
delicate
mouthfeel
gentle
sweetness
and
beer
stabilizing
malt
base
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
or
try
more
beers
in
this
style
had
this
aged
bottle
well
past
the
enjoy

this

upon
popping
the
cork

off

cut
the

this

as
the

similar
to
a

overall
glad
we
tried
it
no
off

from

it
was
an
experience
not
a
goto
o
i
enjoy
and
appreciate
beer
i
believe
i
have
had
nearly
everything
and
i
respect
the
different
styles
i
have
to
say
that
i
had
infinium
2
years
ago
and
it
was
much
better
not
world
class
but
much
better
back
then
i
was
thinking
wow
this
beer
has
potential
sorry
to
say
i
may
have
tasted
it
at
its
best
back
then
there
was
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
the
appearance
of
the
bottle
my
wife
and
i
drank
and
i
say
that
confidently
even
though
we
drank
it
on
123111
it
was
absolutely
crisp
and
clear
as
was
the
slightly
fruity
smell
and
the
excellent
dry
taste
mouthfeel
was
as
expectedcomparable
to
some
of
the
better
champagnes
we
have
had
it
was
an
excellent
substitue
for
champagne
and
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
better
altbiers
i
have
experienced
despite
the
price
i
would
buy
it
again
logged
from
notes
appearance
is
cloudy
and
orange
with
fizzy
white
head
nose
is
full
of
white
grapes
and
honey
with
a
slight

the
flavor
is

sweet
and
definitely
crosses
into
the
cloying
arena
there
is
no
dryness
or
tannins
to
helps
mellow
this
out
which
is
unfortunate
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
well
carbonated

this
is
pretty
uninspiring
this

the

s
heavy
character

this
is
a
good
beer
but
with

the

are
not

deep

it
has
a
sharp
acrid

i
put
it
on
a
level
with

very
similar
to

it
is

glad
i

this

dont
get
why
people
dont
like
this
brew
its
really
different
with
a
good
flavor
obviously
not
an
every
day
brew
but
its
really
a
nice
alternative
to
champagne
for
the
beer
drinker
i
felt
obligated
to
apologize
for
offering
this
to
my
friends
as
a
toast
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
another
bottle
as
a
beer
experience
nothing
special
not
enough
interesting
beery
stuff
going
on
big
bottle
so
find
someone
to
share
with
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
one
unique
beer
although
there
is
really
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
beer
it
presents
differently
on
the
palate
versus
other
styles
i
really
think
this
beer
could
have
been
much
better
that
what
it
was
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
the
alcohol
is
absolutely
well
hidden
what
is
really
appalling
is
the
price
tag
on
these
theyre
still
sitting
at
19
99
in
reno
at
the
end
of
2012
would
never
buy
at
a
price
tag
above
1
o
this
beer
is
not
good
like
i
said
i
have
no
idea
what
this
style
is
supposed
to
resemble
but
this
cant
be
it
i
tend
to
review
beers
based
on
how
they
fit
their
given
style
this
means
that
even
if
im
not
a
fan
of
a
given
style
a
beer
can
still
get
high
marks
that
said
this
beer
is
downright
offensive
i
cant
imagine
that
an
entire
style
would
be
offensive
to
me
there
have
been
very
very
few
beers
that
i
have
had
trouble
finishing
this
is
one
of
them
even
with
splitting
the
bottle
with
someone
very
disappointing
especially
given
the
price
tag
and
the
reputations
of
the
collaborating
breweries
weird
how
little
people
like
this
i
thought
it
was
pretty
solid
although
i
had
a
bottle
more
than
two
years
old
the
pour
was
nothing
special
cloudy
and
dull
wheat
color
looks
like
a
hefe
the
nose
is
crazy
yeast
sweet
booze
some
strange
fruity
essences
and
rotting
wood
flavor
is
a
little
less
disjointed
than
the
nose
but
the
yeast
is
so
weird
it
takes
over
theres
like
a
fermented
peach
or
pear
flavor
to
it
that
works
with
the
yeast
dry
and
stinging
finish
i
like
the
mouthfeel
for
what
it
is
smooth
with
an
alcohol
burn
and
more
bubbles
than
most
beers
with
this
kind
of
age
on
them
usually
have
overall
i
think
it
probably
missed
the
mark
a
little
but
but
its
an
ambitious
brew
with
no
shortage
of
complexity
i
might
pick
up
a
newer
bottle
for
the
holidays
its
got
that
kind
of
feel
really
enjoyed
this
beer
doesnt
really
fit
the
style
in
my
opinion
but
the
overall
product
is
wonderful
drinks
more
like
a
beer
in
the
67
range
overall
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
buy
it
again
it
is
certainly
not
horrible
but
it
does
not
taste
or
feel
like
a
beer
it
came
off
as
an
easy
to
drink
champagne
and
it
really
was
not
by
cup
of
tea
er
beer
while
i
was
really
hesitant
to
try
this
which
i
did
before
i
read
all
the
mixed
to
negative
feedback
this
still
proved
to
be
a
type
of
beer
that
ive
never
had
before
its
extremely
complex
and
contains
tons
of
subtle
aspects
to
it
as
well
but
its
unique
in
its
own
right
as
someone
who
loves
bananas
and
caramel
this
turns
out
to
be
rather
brilliant
even
if
it
is
pricey
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
gift
and
with
autumn
around
its
toasty
enough
for
the
current
cold
weather
i
can
tell
these
two
breweries
put
their
hearts
into
this
one
and
while
it
may
not
be
the
greatest
beer
ive
had
its
definitely
one
of
the
most
fascinating
ill
have
for
now
pretty
much
the
same
as
what
everyone
else
is
saying
this
is
definitely
a
novelty
beer
split
a
bottle
with
someone
and
we
both
had
the
what
did
we
just
drink
attitude
a
beerchampagne
cross
that
kinda
works
but
kinda
doesnt
work
i
feel
it
could
be
the
start
of
something
better
but
in
this
form
its
just
all
over
the
place
i
really
enjoyed
that
amount
of
carbonation
very
unique
but
the
tastesmell
just
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
id
recommend
trying
this
if
you
have
a
few
friends
around
to
share
the
novelty
of
it
as
far
as
drinking
a
whole
bottle
yourself
good
luck
o
very
unique
beer
i
will
give
it
that
unfortunately
not
in
a
particularly
good
way
its
some
sort
of
strange
crossbreed
between
beer
and
champagne
as
i
suppose
the
name
implies
lots
of
wine
characteristics
which
just
dont
go
tastes
mostly
like
spoiled
fruit
unfortunately
i
drained
pour
it
after
a
few
ounces
not
completely
offensive
but
not
remotely
enjoyable
either
and
the
body
is
just
fine
spritzey
medium
body
high
carbonation
too
bad
it
tastes
and
smells
bad
o
kinda
underwhelming
and
not
exactly
worth
the
cost
imo
bought
this
one
on
a
whim
and
held
onto
it
since
reviews
werent
favorable
and
it
needed
to
dry
out
so
it
aged
for
awhile
in
my
chest
freezer
turned
cellar
maybe
im
expecting
too
much
from
it
but
it
just
seems
to
lack
complexity
im
not
a
fan
of
drain
pouring
a
beer
but
an
entire
bottle
to
myself
is
going
to
be
a
bit
much
overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
buy
it
again
it
was
more
of
a
novelty
toy
beer
than
something
to
have
more
than
once
as
a
taste
little
disappointed
with
sam
adams
on
this
one
however
i
i
ranked
this
high
on
taste
because
of
the
uniqueness
of
this
brew
note
nothing
like
the
one
i
had
last
year
where
the
residual
sweetness
was
just
short
of
cloying
im
not
sure
f
the
bottle
was
infected
if
it
is
its
in
a
good
way
but
i
dont
care
because
dry
is
good
and
sour
is
great
in
my
book
tasting
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
is
alright
then
i
started
tasting
more
and
more
i
slowly
got
very
tired
of
the
taste
then
almost
sick
in
my
stomach
i
definitly
wont
try
this
again
i
couldnt
get
through
a
glass
but
this
is
just
my
experience
if
i
would
have
only
had
a
taster
glass
i
would
have
walked
away
saying
this
beer
was
pretty
ok
maybe
even
great
o
this
is
a
tough
one
to
place
it
has
some
drinkable
qualities
but
it
is
more
champagne
than
beer
in
my
opinion
which
takes
away
from
the
point
overall
a
terrible
beer
would
never
recommend
for
enjoyment
i
could
of
bought
a
12
pack
of
hopslam
dammit
o
a
very
nice
collaboration
the
beer
for
me
lives
up
to
its
beautiful
bottle
o
not
my
favorite
beer
in
this
style
as
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
not
as
well
hidden
as
i
would
prefer
if
you
are
expecting
deus
from
this
champagne
beer
youll
be
disappointed
watching
the
video
on
the
boston
beer
website
made
it
clear
that
the
goal
was
to
create
a
beer
style
that
had
never
brewed
before
even
in
the
1000
year
history
of
weihenstephaner
from
my
two
samples
they
accomplished
their
goal
infinium
is
both
perplexing
challenging
and
defies
any
beer
definition
i
have
in
my
head
if
youre
looking
for
a
unique
collaboration
beer
drink
a
bottleor
two
like
me
however
while
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
i
doubt
id
pick
up
another
if
it
crossed
my
path
theres
so
much
going
on
i
think
its
just
too
damn
busy
for
me
itd
be
interesting
to
replace
champagne
with
this
originally
reviewed
12132010
d
this
was
not
much
like
champagne
beyond
the
appearance
but
it
was
still
interesting
to
try
the
scent
and
taste
were
more
like
a
biere
de
garde
to
me
the
body
was
fitting
but
not
refined
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
there
was
nothing
exciting
about
this
brew
to
make
it
worth
the
price
not
recommended
well
this
certainly
is
a
nice
lookin
bottle
we
have
here
the
beer
smells
like
candy
and
fruit
but
some
fruit
i
cant
remember
the
name
of
from
when
i
lived
in
hawaii
maybe
its
lychee
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
yet
smooth
enough
i
suppose
a
bit
too
much
of
a
bitter
ending
that
oddly
meshes
with
the
sugary
tone
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
but
really
wheres
the
complexity
wheres
the
interesting
character
coming
from
1000
years
of
brewing
expertise
on
taste
alone
the
beer
is
alright
but
add
into
the
mix
two
major
breweries
contributing
to
its
production
and
the
price
tag
and
this
one
is
falling
quite
short
very
well
balanced
flavor
profile
from
start
to
finish
toasty
sweet
malts
mixed
with
a
dry
fruit
champagne
yeast
and
earthy
citric
hops
well
balanced
just
a
little
warm
on
the
abv
finish
pretty
good
beer
though
glad
i
tried
and
shared
it
with
my
fiance
and
good
buddy
o
a
reasonable
quaffing
beer
but
definitely
not
the
highly
hyped
champagne
replacement
for
new
years
eve
overall
not
bad
a
nice
changeup
from
ipas
and
such
pretty
much
a
saison
like
hybird
white
wine
its
sour
and
bitter
but
the
added
sugars
save
it
from
being
too
sickning
sour
its
missing
something
maybe
hops
it
is
overpriced
but
its
worth
a
drink
for
something
different
d
regal
and
sophisticated
great
packaging
the
price
was
a
bit
difficult
to
swallow
the
beer
was
a
mixed
bag
the
uniqueness
is
much
appreciated
the
execution
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
the
end
result
is
a
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
nor
seek
out
again
especially
given
the
price
point
odoverall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
underrated
its
not
the
second
coming
or
anything
but
its
a
pretty
cool
glass
of
fizz
too
expensive
for
a
20
750
ml
but
its
an
interesting
novelty
worth
trying
preferably
sharing
not
as
bad
as
its
rating
may
lead
you
to
believe
o
at
18
its
a
bit
hard
to
justify
getting
this
again
while
not
entirely
off
its
out
of
my
spectrum
i
dont
mind
having
this
as
a
birthday
beer
but
its
difficult
to
approach
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
loads
of
head
that
quickly
fades
this
takes
some
time
to
pour
into
the
small
flute
glass
lots
of
carbonation
from
the
base
of
the
glass
nice
looking
pour
smell
is
pretty
subtle
but
yeasts
doughs
and
malts
make
up
the
nose
taste
is
very
carbonated
with
euro
yeast
and
some
fruits
grapes
are
definitely
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
super
carbonated
overall
this
was
alright
decent
in
small
portions
but
the
full
bottle
is
not
for
me
love
deus
brut
de
flanders
and
malheur
brut
so
this
has
some
clownsized
shoes
to
fill
love
the
packaging
looks
clear
caramel
with
an
active
head
that
goes
away
quickly
not
reminding
me
of
champagne
so
far
smell
is
cherries
and
pears
very
sweet
taste
is
really
sweet
up
front
then
pepper
then
a
really
odd
pear
aftertaste
clean
finish
but
wow
an
odd
aftertaste
its
nice
and
tingly
with
a
slickness
but
thats
the
best
bit
overall
just
not
doing
it
for
me
im
finishing
the
bottle
but
its
making
me
burp
weird
pear
candy
smell
into
my
nose
yes
thats
my
official
review
pours
a
clear
copper
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
hop
hint
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
spice
fits
the
style
of
a
biere
de
champagne
biere
brut
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
yeast
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
hops
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
spice
overall
great
aroma
blend
body
and
complexity
o
one
of
the
strangest
beers
i
have
ever
had
my
first
ever
drain
pour
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
couldnt
overall
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
the
white
wine
spritzer
very
delicate
with
a
decent
amount
of
nuance
its
hard
to
justify
the
price
per
bottle
given
these
characteristics
bought
the
750
ml
champagne
bottle
for
almost
20
bucks
at
a
little
corner
liqueur
store
to
summarize
looks
promising
smells
ok
tastes
bad
they
had
a
sixer
of
hopslam
for
17
bills
for
three
fewer
dollars
i
could
have
had
almost
three
times
as
much
high
gravity
super
premium
beer
and
i
would
have
really
enjoyed
it
this
stuff
is
very
disappointing
and
i
wont
have
it
again
wasnt
my
favorite
for
being
advertised
as
a
special
beer
or
once
in
a
lifetime
special
it
wasnt
kind
of
dissapointed
with
it
maybe
i
missed
something
or
it
just
wasnt
my
style
im
sure
there
are
many
more
that
will
come
and
go
maybe
ill
try
it
again
sometime
and
ill
like
it
more
o
pretty
good
not
something
that
id
drink
all
the
time
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
not
quite
worth
the
19
i
spent
on
it
but
i
feel
they
accomplished
what
they
were
going
for
rather
curious
flavour
profile
and
not
one
very
common
however
it
works
for
me
enough
at
least
if
i
were
to
do
things
again
id
chip
in
on
a
bottle
with
a
friend
or
two
i
had
enough
to
quench
my
curiosity
about
a
glassful
in
on
that
note
a
good
bottle
to
pick
up
for
a
dinner
party
or
pair
with
food
o
rather
big
beer
too
sweet
and
boozy
there
are
underlying
notes
that
seem
to
save
it
at
moments
but
generally
not
enough
i
was
quite
disappointed
by
this
beer
not
what
i
expected
o
enjoyable
for
its
uniqueness
but
not
good
enough
to
really
seek
out
as
something
uttery
great
worth
trying
at
least
once
we
cracked
a
bottle
of
this
in
the
limo
after
i
got
married
so
regardless
of
actual
taste
it
will
always
be
a
special
beer
for
me
for
the
memories
it
recalls
definitely
worth
trying
once
for
the
experience
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
sure
if
i
will
get
another
one
sam
adams
always
a
good
decision
overall
a
complex
beer
and
much
better
than
the
previous
year
i
like
the
buttery
notes
i
would
drink
this
again
if
not
for
the
price
o
the
boozy
thin
caramel
flavored
water
is
a
bit
hard
to
drink
it
doesnt
have
any
champagnelike
qualities
everything
is
out
of
balance
with
alcohol
heat
and
sugar
sweet
being
way
to
strong
with
the
carbonation
trying
to
do
its
part
but
it
is
still
not
crisp
i
dont
know
if
you
chilled
this
in
the
freezer
for
a
bit
if
it
was
designed
to
taste
better
ice
cold
i
dont
think
age
would
help
this
especially
with
the
sweetness
the
taste
of
this
one
is
just
bad
all
other
aspects
barely
make
a
statement
beyond
average
this
is
a
beer
i
just
couldnt
get
into
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
often
a
wolf
in
a
sheeps
clothing
sexy
presentation
with
the
sleek
bottle
but
the
liquid
inside
is
no
where
near
worth
what
it
costs
i
want
my
money
back
from
two
breweries
i
respect
i
expect
much
more
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
one
o
this
was
a
nice
alternative
to
a
champagne
but
it
was
not
one
of
my
favorites
o
certainly
an
intriguing
style
with
some
unique
characteristics
tons
of
flavour
and
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
would
be
a
great
beer
for
food
pairings
and
although
i
found
it
a
bit
pricey
i
would
recommend
trying
it
if
ever
given
the
opportunity
thebeeralmanac
com
o
i
can
admit
the
mystique
and
hype
gave
me
high
expectations
they
werent
met
if
it
was
less
hyped
and
much
cheaper
it
would
be
a
fine
beer
but
as
is
its
a
disappointment
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beermany
may
bash
this
beer
and
not
appreciate
it
but
one
must
understand
that
this
is
not
the
typical
beer
and
is
far
more
like
champagne
as
it
is
meant
to
be
if
one
understands
that
going
into
trying
this
beer
a
far
better
appreciation
of
this
beer
will
be
developed
if
you
dont
like
champagne
dont
even
bother
with
the
20
something
it
will
cost
to
buy
it
but
if
you
can
appreciate
it
it
is
worth
it
for
that
special
occasion
or
worth
trying
o
but
do
i
like
it
no
well
not
exactly
all
that
akin
to
that
famous
gallic
bubbly
offering
is
it
more
like
painting
the
right
carbonation
onto
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
so
while
still
perfectly
drinkable
its
like
chimay
with
more
bubbles
thanks
hon
you
pretty
much
nailed
it
the
subtleties
of
the
best
of
this
weird
hybrid
style
are
lost
in
the
mire
here
it
does
do
one
other
champagneesque
thing
well
though
the
wine
level
booze
sneaks
up
on
you
well
hidden
as
it
is
o
an
interesting
beer
but
not
with
the
money
drinkable
especially
considering
the
alcohol
content
ive
talked
to
a
lot
of
people
about
this
beer
and
my
experience
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
exception
im
not
sure
if
there
is
a
big
variance
from
bottle
to
bottle
on
this
problems
with
transportation
the
brewing
process
or
just
an
infection
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
trying
it
in
2012
b
damn
with
a
smell
of
sour
grapes
feel
of
malted
barley
with
a
slight
aroma
of
hops
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
but
balanced
smooth
texture
and
feel
and
retains
a
medium
head
on
the
glass
overall
i
gave
this
beer
a
high
rating
because
of
what
it
was
meant
to
be
and
that
it
accomplished
that
successfully
it
is
not
a
campfire
beer
or
a
session
beer
this
beer
was
made
to
compete
with
champaign
and
it
does
that
my
experience
with
this
beer
was
very
positive
the
food
tasted
better
because
of
the
beer
normally
we
talk
about
beer
tasting
better
because
of
food
and
that
is
the
difference
here
serving
type
bottle
after
as
the
beer
settled
down
it
left
me
feeling
like
i
did
not
want
another
infinium
so
it
was
not
what
i
call
highly
drinkable
the
qualities
this
shared
with
champagne
were
mostly
in
mouthfeel
but
it
came
off
more
like
a
berliner
weisse
this
is
not
an
earthshattering
beer
in
any
way
but
considering
the
strange
style
its
pretty
good
it
seems
to
have
a
bad
reputation
because
of
the
hype
and
the
price
tag
haters
gonna
hate
overall
this
one
was
still
a
fairly
pleasant
beer
i
dont
regret
purchasing
a
bottle
at
20
because
i
got
to
split
the
cost
it
is
definitely
a
unique
beer
worth
a
try
and
if
you
can
go
in
halves
with
someone
i
would
recommend
for
sure
this
is
rather
bland
overall
with
prominent
alcohol
a
potentially
nice
floral
and
citrus
presence
is
all
but
lost
in
the
yeast
and
alcohol
i
dont
think
it
really
is
a
25
a
bottle
brew
o
an
interesting
brew
definitly
could
smell
and
taste
better
but
im
happy
with
it
overall
is
it
a
20
bottle
no
but
ill
take
a
hit
and
buy
it
again
next
year
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
based
on
other
reviews
but
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
basically
just
one
more
beer
knocked
off
my
wish
list
overall
to
be
compared
to
real
champagne
i
would
have
expected
drier
but
thats
fine
as
i
dont
really
care
for
dry
wine
i
like
the
taste
and
nice
to
try
the
unique
style
however
not
worth
the
high
pricetag
a
good
event
beer
infinium
would
do
better
with
less
hype
this
said
quite
enjoyable
and
definitely
improves
with
warmth
o
not
sure
how
this
was
when
fresh
but
as
is
it
isnt
something
i
would
want
to
have
again
pours
a
beautiful
dark
goldorange
color
with
a
perfect
two
finger
white
head
awesome
cloudlike
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
for
the
10
3
abv
fairly
cloudy
in
appearance
the
nose
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
grains
weak
hops
super
light
fruit
smell
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
slightly
funky
and
sweet
with
hops
citrus
yeast
and
a
very
champagnebeer
type
taste
to
it
definitely
unique
but
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
within
the
style
not
bad
but
not
a
great
taste
i
dont
get
any
of
the
alcohol
either
which
is
fairly
amazing
feel
is
light
and
very
carbonated
definitely
has
that
champagne
fizzy
quality
to
it
overall
this
is
my
first
biere
de
champagne
and
im
not
sure
i
dig
it
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
though
and
tick
the
style
cheers
maybe
if
the
body
had
been
crisp
and
bubbly
it
could
have
been
salvaged
but
it
falls
flat
a
champagne
beer
interesting
i
like
champagne
and
i
like
beer
dont
like
this
so
much
very
bland
and
underwhelming
i
struggled
to
really
smell
anything
and
the
taste
wasnt
much
different
dirty
fruit
but
very
subtle
dirty
fruit
overall
the
changes
made
between
the
vintages
are
very
evident
basically
the
2011
version
dialed
up
the
malt
flavor
in
a
major
way
in
some
ways
the
2010
vintage
was
more
creative
and
flavorful
albeit
its
probably
not
for
everyone
in
my
mind
this
beer
still
seems
to
fall
short
of
what
two
strong
breweries
couldshould
produce
also
this
beer
as
it
stands
in
2011
is
not
different
or
complex
enough
to
warrant
spending
the
amount
charged
notes
neither
deserving
the
hate
nor
the
hype
seen
in
some
places
at
least
not
in
this
second
brewing
incarnation
a
bit
pricey
for
what
one
gets
the
presentation
socially
is
quite
well
made
but
while
approachable
it
is
a
tad
too
sweet
for
the
casual
gathering
where
something
like
this
seems
to
call
for
a
dryer
touch
not
so
much
champagne
like
or
even
a
hybrid
beerchampagne
offering
but
a
good
brew
nevertheless
probably
worth
buying
if
you
enjoy
funky
belgianssours
overall
more
of
a
champagne
with
a
bit
of
beer
flavor
not
bad
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
and
for
the
price
not
something
i
would
likely
do
again
got
a
chance
to
try
the
2011
version
over
new
years
watched
the
youtube
video
of
the
story
of
this
prior
to
drinking
really
cool
video
definitely
check
it
out
anyways
pours
a
highly
carbonated
golden
color
smell
is
of
apples
taste
is
light
to
medium
bodied
very
effervescent
and
tart
taste
reminiscent
of
champagne
and
applespears
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
does
not
taste
like
a
10
abv
for
sure
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
although
the
tartness
does
get
to
you
after
a
while
an
interesting
beer
a
little
steep
price
wise
20
a
bottle
to
justify
getting
it
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
and
has
a
cool
story
tasting
courtesy
of
my
bud
coldbrewky
pop
goes
the
cork
on
this
poured
into
a
wine
glass
golden
hue
with
a
silky
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
tons
of
carbonation
nose
is
mostly
earthy
slight
yeast
and
past
prime
smelling
apples
malt
is
front
and
center
mild
fruitness
on
the
edges
medium
bodied
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
devisive
beer
this
is
not
what
i
expected
flavor
wise
at
all
based
on
the
style
i
was
expecting
dry
and
crisp
this
was
more
fruity
and
malty
the
sweetness
was
a
tad
much
especially
having
the
bottle
to
myself
that
said
i
dont
see
this
as
the
horrible
beer
that
its
made
out
to
im
glad
it
was
a
gift
and
maybe
that
plays
a
part
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
update
had
a
2011
bottle
this
year
not
much
of
a
change
though
got
the
bottle
as
a
gift
so
that
why
i
had
it
again
a
side
note
would
be
however
that
it
had
a
much
heavier
pineapple
presence
this
year
that
was
strong
throughout
the
drink
i
would
not
buy
this
again
overall
i
was
surprised
by
infinium
it
was
much
better
than
i
expected
though
i
cant
see
drinking
it
regularly
its
very
much
worth
a
try
though
since
its
so
different
from
the
rest
of
their
products
had
this
saturday
night
rather
than
champagne
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
straw
hazed
color
with
spritzy
head
atoppretty
much
what
was
expected
aromas
are
light
with
toasted
bread
and
some
pear
notesflavors
are
decent
but
they
became
a
little
to
sweet
after
awhile
caramelbutter
flavors
mixed
with
some
greenapplelike
tartnessthe
alcohol
began
to
creep
and
bring
the
sweetness
level
way
up
after
about
mid
bottle
not
as
bad
in
my
opinion
as
many
others
think
but
its
not
great
by
any
means
and
overpricedglad
i
tried
it
thought
id
try
this
in
place
of
traditional
champagne
but
this
was
horrible
all
kinds
of
clashing
flavors
leaving
a
bad
aftertaste
only
place
to
go
is
up
after
this
in
2012
i
was
rather
disappointed
by
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
opaque
orange
color
with
a
finely
textured
head
that
faded
quickly
sweet
boozy
and
malty
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
noticeable
hoppiness
i
didnt
really
see
any
resemblance
to
champagne
i
think
thats
more
of
a
marketing
ploy
to
position
this
as
an
alternative
id
drink
it
again
if
i
had
the
opportunity
but
i
would
definitely
not
buy
it
again
o
overall
probably
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
considering
the
high
price
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
pint
glass
dont
have
any
champagne
glases
the
body
is
dark
orange
color
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
tart
and
fruity
the
taste
is
of
green
apple
with
some
pear
notes
with
a
dry
finish
this
beer
is
close
to
champagne
very
carbonated
and
goes
down
nice
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
did
try
this
beer
last
year
but
didnt
really
remember
what
i
though
of
it
now
to
bring
in
the
new
year
of
2012
i
popped
the
cork
on
a
2011
infinium
at
one
of
my
favorite
spots
the
galley
in
naples
maine
wasnt
impressed
expected
more
of
a
belgin
style
and
felt
that
it
was
more
like
a
sour
beer
taste
some
may
agree
some
may
not
who
knows
maybe
next
year
my
taste
buds
will
mature
happy
new
year
cheers
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
several
wine
glasses
dont
own
champagne
flutes
the
beer
is
clear
orange
in
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
big
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
of
green
apples
and
pears
it
is
very
champagne
like
but
more
tart
green
apple
notes
are
prominent
drying
finish
the
carbonation
is
very
high
body
is
mediumlight
well
hidden
abv
a
very
interesting
sipper
i
enjoyed
it
as
did
everyone
i
shared
my
bottles
with
most
agreed
this
could
sub
for
champagne
i
sampled
the
2011
version
reading
the
reviews
this
batch
seems
to
be
better
than
the
original
serving
temp
40
f
overall
not
bad
this
beer
has
gotten
some
pretty
negative
reviews
but
i
enjoyed
it
will
i
pay
20
for
it
never
again
would
i
drink
it
again
absolutely
o
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
boozy
cider
not
that
much
like
champagne
though
then
again
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
some
bubbly
overall
this
works
for
me
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
it
was
much
better
than
i
expected
i
might
go
on
out
and
get
me
a
2011
vintage
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
20
and
could
get
it
in
a
smaller
bottle
imo
this
is
one
to
be
enjoyed
with
friends
its
a
large
format
of
an
odd
style
to
try
and
take
out
by
yourself
although
it
would
be
easy
to
do
just
come
into
this
beer
with
an
open
mind
and
enjoy
the
experience
a
very
special
thanks
to
sam
adams
and
weihnstephan
for
producing
a
moderately
priced
odd
beer
style
for
us
to
have
it
was
a
great
experience
lighter
medium
body
high
carbonation
prickly
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
im
not
really
thrilled
by
these
champagnebeer
fusion
ideas
i
e
bells
sparkling
this
is
also
way
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
serving
type
bottle
overall
definitely
a
different
taste
not
a
style
im
very
familiar
with
not
bad
not
great
my
first
biere
de
champagne
and
not
bad
for
certain
occasions
o
this
beer
would
be
a
little
easier
to
drink
if
it
lacked
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
was
better
hidden
from
the
taste
o
infinium
is
an
interesting
beer
that
really
does
taste
like
a
bubbly
wine
its
not
an
everyday
drink
but
good
for
the
occasion
i
find
this
to
be
an
interesting
beer
its
unlike
other
beers
ive
had
and
its
certainly
not
a
sparkling
wine
perhaps
there
is
some
justification
to
the
claim
that
they
created
a
new
style
of
beer
when
they
brewed
inifinium
anyway
im
glad
ive
tried
this
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
an
entire
bottle
for
myself
if
you
are
headed
to
a
party
with
a
bunch
of
beer
drinkers
bringing
a
bottle
to
share
would
be
a
good
idea
o
a
novelty
beer
enjoyed
with
fondue
on
nye
2011
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
anytime
soon
odefinietly
has
the
look
of
champagne
but
also
the
price
good
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
o
looks
and
smells
really
good
wish
more
of
the
sugars
had
fermented
out
in
the
bottle
not
worth
the
single
bottle
price
overall
i
like
that
sam
adams
and
weihenstephan
gave
this
a
shot
its
got
potential
if
they
can
reformulate
to
make
it
a
little
lighter
and
crisper
on
the
palate
if
you
have
a
chance
to
score
new
glarus
products
id
recommend
a
raspberry
tart
or
wisconsin
belgian
red
to
ring
in
the
new
year
not
a
beer
im
particularly
excited
to
have
tried
nor
one
i
would
try
again
i
was
enticed
by
the
claims
of
a
champagnelike
delight
but
what
you
recieve
is
a
whole
lot
less
crisper
than
that
it
pours
orangegolden
in
color
with
champagnelike
bubbles
and
foam
the
aroma
is
fruity
assorted
melons
a
touch
of
floral
honey
sweetness
the
taste
is
also
fruity
sweet
yet
with
a
fruit
tartness
the
finish
is
quite
dry
this
beer
is
unique
interesting
and
tastes
good
pours
a
beauiful
golden
amber
color
that
is
very
highly
carbonated
leaving
a
large
pillowy
head
has
scents
of
yeast
and
apricots
taste
is
semihoppy
with
apricot
flavors
which
are
rather
mellow
and
slighty
dry
this
is
a
true
sipping
beer
and
i
would
not
suggest
taking
on
the
whole
bottle
by
yourself
because
it
is
rather
filling
if
this
was
a
67
beer
people
would
probably
love
it
but
since
its
a
1520
beer
i
was
left
feeling
like
i
didnt
get
my
moneys
worth
i
understand
the
involved
process
of
making
this
beer
but
a
lot
of
your
normal
beer
shoppers
will
not
it
was
a
good
beer
but
you
can
get
a
beer
that
tastes
just
as
good
at
half
the
price
overall
some
say
champagne
some
say
soda
i
say
good
it
is
complex
maybe
a
little
sweet
heavy
carbonation
bubbles
through
out
your
mouth
i
say
try
it
you
cant
trust
the
reviews
till
you
trust
your
own
your
own
judgement
cheers
mo
over
carbonated
with
a
sticky
feel
not
impressed
especially
for
the
price
o
an
alright
beer
and
an
interesting
style
but
for
the
price
id
much
rather
be
drinking
a
good
trappist
not
too
thick
dark
amber
color
large
frothy
head
with
big
bubbles
and
tons
coming
up
nutty
raisin
scent
with
a
strong
malt
presence
nice
flavor
of
champagne
yeast
and
a
taste
reminiscent
to
a
quad
dates
fig
raisin
grapes
darker
fruit
with
a

nice
beer
high
price
tag
for
what
it
is
though
overall
definitely
a
unique
beer
that
leans
a
bit
towards
the
winelike
side
very
slow
drinking
you
need
to
share
the
bottle
with
a
few
friends
light
refreshing
fruityspicy
brew
i
get
the
champagne
reference
slightly
reminiscent
of
a
pilsner
in
the
soft
maltynoble
hop
departments
but
the
fruitiness
makes
this
something
else
entirely
the
nose
is
sweet
and
slightly
malty
the
taste
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
it
is
super
malty
and
sweet
with
a
syrup
mouth
feel
and
a
cough
syrup
sting
on
the
finish
all
and
all
meh
interesting
mouthfeel
nice
golden
color
with
a
sizeable
white
head
darker
then
i
was
expecting
for
sure
tart
soomewhat
green
aroma
very
solid
sweet
malty
flavor
a
whisper
of
booziness
tart
somewhat
acidic
very
full
mouthfeel
the
maltiness
is
still
there
and
sticky
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
much
lighter
and
more
champagne
like
this
bottle
was
a
gift
dont
know
if
i
would
spend
the
money
myself
but
it
will
go
on
my
wants
for
sure
very
unique
one
and
a
half
hands
of
frothy
foam
with
some
lacing
on
a
bubbly
hazy
golden
amber
body
musty
apple
and
pineapple
smell
with
orange
peel
smells
a
lot
like
one
of
those
multi
fruit
juice
doleminutemaid
mixtures
more
cour
multi
fruit
juice
taste
with
a
lingering
musty
aftertaste
almost
tastes
like
a
bad
wild
ale
high
carbonatin
and
light
body
this
is
a
cool
idea
the
taste
is
not
very
good
but
the
rest
is
a
actually
ok
just
need
to
work
on
the
taste
sampled
from
a
flute
glass
very
light
scent
of
citrusy
fruit
slightly
alchoholic
smell
taste
is
sweet
and
appealing
poured
an
orangeyyellow
body
with
full
unstoppable
beige
head
no
hoppiness
at
all
will
not
appeal
to
hopheads
at
all
bright
and
tingly
on
the
tounge
i
paid
18
99
for
this
brew
and
told
my
fiance
it
was
champagne
beer
which
she
became
interested
in
but
was
highly
dissapointed
in
its
heavy
aspects
and
big
malty
unbalanced
profile
mvery
bubbly
could
see
how
it
gets
a
champagne
of
beer
category
overall
drinkability
sum
is
better
than
the
parts
very
enjoyable
poured
a
massive
all
head
custard
colored
held
pretty
good
but
when
it
did
deflate
it
did
so
quickly
slightly
hazed
and
deep
golden
in
color
smell
is
nice
with
yeast
caramel
dried
fruits
and
fig
taste
follows
smell
with
an
emphasis
on
the
caramel
and
a
citrus
tang
in
the
aftertaste
mild
but
fairly
long
finish
with
a
faint
burn
from
the
alcohol
and
though
this
tops
10
alcohol
i
think
its
fairly
well
hidden
the
alcohol
doesnt
slap
you
in
the
face
right
away
allinall
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
a
treat
though
whether
its
the
champagne
of
beer
is
debatable
as
well
as
whether
it
deserves
the
over
20
price
tag
overall
i
wont
buy
this
again
especially
at
20
for
the
bottle
it
is
a
decent
beer
just
not
at
this
price
level
enjoy
with
fine
aged
cheeses
or
perhaps
fruity
tart
sherbet
wow
what
can
i
say
very
disappointed
i
feel
like
someone
tried
to
carbonate
maple
syrup
i
couldnt
get
past
half
a
champagne
flute
i
am
not
sure
what
sam
adams
was
going
for
here
but
they
missed
the
mark
the
texture
of
the
beer
is
very
heavy
and
the
aroma
leaves
one
to
wonder
what
they
were
trying
to
achieve
in
some
respects
it
leans
more
toward
a
bad
version
of
utopia
the
cork
popped
with
a
nice
sound
and
i
poured
into
a
couple
of
champagne
flutes
the
eggnogcolored
head
was
big
and
fluffy
and
quickly
took
up
over
half
of
the
glass
the
nose
had
notes
of
vanilla
and
nutmeg
color
was
a
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
lots
of
co2
bubbles
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
caramel
candylike
initially
giving
way
to
a
soft
grassy
bitterness
finish
was
continued
with
that
same
sweetness
and
you
can
guess
where
this
is
going
for
this
selfavowed
hophead
it
was
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
i
was
glad
a
to
have
had
someone
with
whom
to
share
it
and
b
to
have
tried
it
but
it
might
not
be
compelling
enough
to
try
again
although
who
knows
i
found
this
cheap
this
year
and
everyone
seems
to
have
loaded
up
on
it
18
another
place
was
selling
for
almost
28
they
are
going
to
choke
on
them
hared
to
draw
a
conclusion
as
i
cannot
compare
within
style
overall
impression
is
an
overthought
overtweaked
recipe
which
ends
up
as
a
mishmash
of
ideas
nothing
ill
ever
buy
again
not
something
people
will
hate
just
no
true
draw
to
want
to
keep
drinking
this
overall
very
disappointed
id
rather
spend
20
at
taco
bell
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
duck
like
i
mentioned
earlier
some
sips
i
like
this
others
not
so
much
thought
this
was
an
odd
wheatwine
while
i
was
tasting
this
blind
overall
i
wish
the
taste
delivered
more
specifically
on
the
sweetness
had
it
not
be
for
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
it
would
be
there
drinkability
isnt
too
high
its
a
strong
thick
heavy
blonde
nice
bottle
though
i
got
this
beer
because
i
wanted
something
special
for
new
years
eve
since
i
work
at
the
store
i
decided
to
take
one
home
with
my
check
and
give
it
a
go
around
before
the
big
night
since
we
did
not
have
any
flute
glasses
we
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
the
appearance
was
a
cloudy
piss
yellow
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
an
inch
thick
head
the
smell
is
of
rotting
apples
but
not
in
a
bad
way
very
sweet
and
fermented
it
smelled
nice
and
reminded
me
of
apple
juice
the
initial
taste
was
once
again
like
fermenting
fruit
very
sweet
and
very
strong
initial
taste
of
alcohol
the
after
taste
was
heavy
on
the
fruit
taste
no
orange
or
citrus
at
all
but
more
of
a
sweet
apple
or
pear
taste
and
mild
caramel
on
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
very
bubbly
and
light
over
all
i
would
give
this
beer
a
3
out
of
5
it
wasnt
awful
but
it
wasnt
great
i
wont
be
getting
this
for
our
celebration
side
note
the
people
that
were
trying
it
with
me
said
that
it
had
a
slight
after
taste
of
soy
sauce
i
didnt
taste
this
but
they
insisted
that
i
add
it
to
my
review
to
warn
the
masses
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
going
on
not
much
head
the
smell
is
slightly
fruity
and
dry
with
some
errant
coconut
the
taste
is
a
little
unexpected
what
comes
to
mind
is
orange
cough
medicine
and
furniture
polish
after
it
warms
a
little
its
still
not
good
what
ever
the
guys
were
going
for
here
they
missed
somewhat
heavy
mouthfeel
with
heavy
carbonation
very
unusual
i
suggest
passing
on
this
beer
pours
a
deep
hazy
golden
color
with
an
enourmous
fluffy
head
the
head
gives
way
to
a
skim
and
leaves
gobs
and
stings
of
lace
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
honey
clove
and
a
slight
grassy
aroma
the
aroma
is
slightly
faint
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
sweet
malt
backbone
before
honey
and
clove
flavors
come
through
there
is
also
a
presence
of
grapes
and
citrus
along
with
a
slight
grassy
hop
bite
complex
but
not
strong
the
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
and
dry
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
im
glad
i
had
it
but
not
sure
how
many
more
i
would
get
overall
i
wanted
this
to
be
drier
and
a
lot
less
sweet
not
a
huge
fan
very
interesting
beer
bizarrely
sweet
i
expected
something
much
more
dry
but
overall
it
was
a
good
interesting
beer
overall
though
i
have
to
admit
this
is
really
different
from
the
other
beer
champagne
type
beers
i
have
had
its
this
sens
of
a
bubbly
light
doppelbock
that
gets
stuck
in
my
head
it
seems
its
very
unique
its
own
animal
hardly
any
noticeable
boozyness
at
all
actually
pretty
darn
good
i
think
everyone
who
was
disappointing
with
last
years
version
should
give
this
years
a
chance
if
you
feel
like
spending
20
that
is
the
beer
comes
in
a
beautiful
25
4
oz
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
it
pours
out
gold
into
a
champagne
glass
it
has
a
huge
head
and
great
lacing
it
is
very
bubbly
as
you
would
expect
with
a
champagne
style
beverage
it
is
very
much
improved
over
last
year
and
is
more
well
rounded
than
last
year
yeah
a
bit
polarised
myself
on
this
polarising
beer
feel
like
it
might
have
been
great
if
the
flavours
got
along
better
but
they
dont
enjoying
this
with
some
friends
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
expectations
neck

we
dont

poured
with
a
very
frothy
off
white
head
that
soon
settled
down
to
a
ring
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
loads
of
big
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeasty
fruity

flavors
similar

that

be
there
body
is
good
and
carbonation
is
fabulous
finish
is
like
flavor
of

a
little

warmth
and
leaves
me
ready
for
another
swig
despite
its
strength
bottle
have
had
this
one
chillin
in
the
fridge
for
a
long
time
kinda
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
lost
in
the
way
back
not
sure
what
to
expect
out
of
it
at
this
time
gives
a
nice
pop
when
opened
and
pours
a
slightly
hazed
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
bone
white
head
the
nose
is
well
interesting
and
reminds
me
of
a
mix
between
provoloneswiss
cheese
and
old
apples
maybe
some
bready
quality
as
well
the
taste
is
well
interesting
too
cheese
apple
some
pear
wheat
biscuit
and
a
slight
yeast

overall
a
let
down
this
had
potential
but
it
just
doesnt
come
together
very
nicely
nice
bottle
but
the
contents
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
blah
overall
im
glad
to
have
finally
tried
it
i
like
that
sam
adams
set
out
to
make
yet
another
intriuging
and
unique
beer
not
sure
if
it
was
worth
the
20
price
tag
but
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
could
find
a
fresh
bottle
and
drink
it
well
before
the
best
buy
date
holy
crap
i
really
had
some
expectations
for
this
but
this
is
genuinely
unpleasant
it
really
does
not
live
up
to
expectations
and
is
closer
to
malt
liquor
than
to
a
brew
between
two
highflying
breweries
like
this
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
tons
of
carbonation
obviously
a
part
of
the
style
drinkable
but
too
bland
for
my
taste
would
not
have
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
i
quite
liked
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
earlier
noticed
the
due
date
if
this
were
brewed
more
often
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
as
a
champagne
alternative
for
festive
occasions
as
the
fruity
flavor
profile
would
no
doubt
appeal
to
the
masses
as
would
the
10
3
abv
im
not
sure
many
people
would
classify
this
as
beer
but
if
you
move
beyond
that
distinction

pull

hopes
a
very
expensive
beer
that
just
does

a

like
polarizing
would
be
the
best
way
to
describe
this
collaboration
its
certainly
not
sa
triple
bock
but
im
not
sure
why
i
paid
so
much
either
would
probably
not
buy
this
again
originally
purchased
two
bottles
and
reviewed
one
in
dec
2010
and
kept
one
in
the
fridge
opened
the
second
bottle
to
taste
and
review
on
010112
surprisingly
not
much
has
changed
after
reading
my
review
it
seems
to
have
less
smell
than
before
only
get
smokey
scents
now
otherwise
everything
seems
the
same
d
a
nice
experiment
in
brewing
i
think
but
too
sweet
for
just
any
occasion
and
i
wouldnt
substitute
this
for
champagne
overall
though
it
was
quite
enjoyable
in
small
amounts
it
goes
does
very
easily
but
its
rich
enough
that
i
wouldnt
want
many
and
thats
before
the
alcohol
hits
altogether
i
feel
this
is
a
tasty
brew
a
bit
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
id
say
this
is
like
any
other
tripel
or
some
brew
of
that
nature
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
a
traditional
champagne
but
the
effervescent
carbonation
keeps
it
light
and
crisp
the
yeast
creates
a
bone
dry
finish
peace
love
big
tuna
it
did
not
have
tons
of
flavors
nor
any
distinguishing
tastes
but
it
was
perfect
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
a
very
tasty
beverage
its
not
what
i
expected
it
was
going
to
be
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
champagne
like
dry
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
if
this
wasnt
20
dollars
a
bottle
i
would
sock
some
away
for
a
rainy
beer
day
but
since
it
is
i
will
just
have
to
say
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
is
an
incredibly
easily
drinkable
beer
for
being
over
10
as
theres
merely
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
on
the
finish
overall
im
impressed
with
this
new
creation
but
im
not
blown
away
this
is
sam
adams
version
of
that
budweiser
celebration
ale
that
ab
released
a
few
years
back
i
mean
i
know
they
were
both
brewed
in
different
ways
but
they
have
the
same
affect
its
like
a
bigger
sweeter
bubblier
version
of
the
flagship
and
while
it
works
its
nothing
too
special
reminding
me
of
classic
sahtis
saisons
hefeweizens
and
sparkling
wines
this
beer
borrows
a
lot
of
characteristics
from
fruityspicycharacterful
beers
of
breadywheaty
origins
where
challenging
i
applaude
the
bravery
of
otherwise
traditional
brewers
to
get
to
these
new
blends
of
taste
its
just
a
step
off
of
the
pace
of
deus
and
brooklyns
sorachi
ale
instead
of
the
medium
bready
mid
palate
that
makes
the
beer
a
bit
fatty
id
prefer
much
more
dryness
and
spiciness
driving
toward
the
finish
it
has
some
of
the
shortfalls
that
often
occur
in
sa
but
overall
it
is
a
solid
and
unique
beer
not
a
20
beer
but
buy
one
and
share
it
it
is
the
best
you
could
do
for
it
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
very
unique
and
interesting
more
than
that
it
is
also
good
to
many
beers
are
just
interesting
to
try
once
though
i
will
finish
the
bottle
without
a
problem
and
probably
get
another
bottle
something
i
would
recommend
drinkability
would
be
absolutely
terrible
if
it
wasnt
for
my
palate
getting
some
what
used
to
whats
going
on
with
the
beer
its
not
nearly
as
bad
as
the
words
ive
typed
up
there
but
this
is
not
something
id
buy
regularly
i
do
think
its
worth
a
shot
despite
the
high
price
tag
drinkability
very
low
for
me
due
to
the
overwhelming
buttery
note
glad
to
try
once
but
totally
disappointed
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
my
first
foray
into
this
style
which
is
good
for
such
a
hyped
beer
pour
is
a
golden
light
amber
head
builds
sudsy
and
white
like
a
belgian
brew
aroma
is
very
unique
syrupy
and
sweet
lots
of
fruity
notes
blending
with
a
pilsnerlike
base
very
complex
brew
lots
of
bready
notes
alelike
with
a
lighter
brew
style
finish
is
dry
with
a
lingering
semisweetness
like
natural
honey
this
is
one
funky
brew
i
think
these
two
breweries
could
have
done
better
probably
collaborating
on
a
strong
brew
or
the
like
but
this
brew
certainly
takes
the
cake
in
the
complexity
department
a
definite
brew
to
try
d
the
bubbles
in
here
are
a
little
much
for
me
the
taste
is
about
average
i
can
almost
feel
the
headache
coming
in
with
each
sip
dm
fantastic
carbonation
and
great
effect
with
the
bubbles
tickles
the
tongue
but
is
still
rather
thick
and
sweet
not
overly
drinkable
but
still
a
decent
brew
a
very
interesting
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
or
blows
me
away
but
it
really
is
nothing
like
ive
ever
had
before
and
i
do
like
it
but
the
price
will
keep
me
from
ever
buying
it
again
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
think
that
sam
adams
would
have
pulled
it
off
and
i
thought
that
weihenstephan
was
being
a
little
ambitious
with
this
interesting
collaboration
but
i
think
it
was
very
nice
another
keen
point
many
beer
connoisseurs
miss
on
this
one
is
that
it
is
approachable
by
the
mainstream
and
the
select
palate
alike
this
is
crucial
fro
marketing
it
and
marketing
their
products
im
sure
this
isnt
going
to
be
the
last
collaboration
that
sam
adams
does
with
weihenstephan
d
very
drinkable
this
has
some
serious
flavors
to
it

masking
the
high
abv

a
really
interesting
collaboration

crisp

im
not
convinced
the
20
price
tag
is
justified
d
quite

though
again
i
personally
feel
like
this
was

suckered
me
again

a
pop
for
a

version

i
will
pass
on
picking
up

bottle
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
for
the
20
price
tag
and
all
of
the
hype
surrounding
it
i
was
very
disappointed
overall
the
beer
is
a
boozy
sweet
mess
with
a
lot
of
different
flavors
and
aromas
that
dont
meld
well
together
i
expected
more
from
two
worldclass
breweries
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
at
an
extremely
high
price
point
i
will
not
try
it
again
this
is
an
interesting
beer
different
than
most
out
there
its
not
really
my
thing
and
for
20
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
kind
of
disjointed
and
odd
however
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
these
guys
do
another
collaboration
again
cheers
editforgot
mouthfeel
added
it
interesting
for
sure
in
that
it
isnt
quite
what
i
expected
but
it
isnt
what
i
necessarily
want
either
glad
i
tried
it
once
note
this
beer
is
really
ok
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
20
00
for
a
bottle
is
a
little
ridiculous
its
not
that
good
if
it
were
perhaps
10
cheaper
i
would
definitly
buy
again
this
is
about
the
hardest
beer
ive
ever
reviewed
unique
to
justify
cost
vs
just
what
i
enjoy
its
tasty
and
unique
which
works
for
me
hmm
not
what
i
expect
at
all
the
sweetness
and
boozy
character
threw
me
for
a
loop
and
makes
it
hardly
drinkable
at
all
not
sure
if
any
length
of
cellaring
will
even
help
this
beer
while
i
applaud
the
efforts
from
packaging
to
the
idea
this
ends
up
being
a
miss
for
me
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
as
sam
adams
were
filming
some
of
the
promotional
items
for
this
ie
the
commercials
poured
in
to
a
sam
adams
snifter
the
color
is
clear
orange
with
a
good
amount
of
foamy
white
head

scores

air
bubbles
in
this
beer
suggest
that
it
is
high
in
carbonation
from
the
nose
i
pick
up
some
soft
peach
and
pear
notes
mango
baked
bread
and
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
is
dry
yet
sweet
with
many
of
the
same
traits
found
in
the
smell
but
not
nearly
as
accentuated
or
clear
as
another
reviewer
stated
it
does
have
a
hint
of
boston
lager
to
it
a
byproduct
of
the
yeast
i
am
assuming
i
also
get
a
minor
hint
of
funk
like
champagne
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
scrubbing
the
palate
well
and
medium
in
body
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
is
a
plus
given
its
overall
strength
i
am
not
sure
where
sam
adamsweihenstephaner
got
the
idea
that
this
is
a
new
style
of
beer
as
there
are
others
out
there
not
many
but
still
i
dont
think
i
would
throw
down
another
twenty
for
a
bottle
but
it
is
worth
trying
given
that
there
are
so
few
examples
of
this
style
around
cheers
to
this
collaborative
ale
750ml
bottle
at
flying
saucer
poured
into
3
tulip
glasses
a
crisp
orange
with
a
decent
slowly
diminishing
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
white
wine
with
a
trace
of
noble
hops
and
mild
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
sweet
fruits
and
grape
with
just
a
slight
hop
bitterness
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
nice
carbonation
there
is
certainly
alcohol
presence
but
its
not
too
much
this
is
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
also
worth
saving
for
a
special
occasion
this
is
pretty
good
i
am
pretty
impressed
though
i
didnt
have
much
of
an
expectation
going
into
it
the
high
abv
and
overall
dryness
of
the
beer
is
good
but
nothing
youd
want
to
stick
with
for
long
this
is
good
to
share
as
a
celebration
drink
not
your
goto
obviously
im
glad
i
was
able
to
grab
two
bottles
of
this
but
in
all
honesty
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
applaud
the
two
breweries
for
the
collaboration
and
im
happy
i
got
to
try
this
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
since
this
is
a
onceanddone
beer
we
think
this
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
fizz
that
settles
down
to
just
a
thin
layer
that
stays
on
the
top
throughout
the
drinking
experience
the
smell
is
of
white
grapes
caramel
honey
and
a
bit
of
oak
sour
it
combines
in
a
rather
nice
way
that
creates
a
sweet
melange
on
the
nostrils
the
taste
is
fruity
with
some
pear
and
orange
caramel
sugars
are
rather
obvious
on
the
palate
as
well
its
got
the
right
amount
of
fizz
but
i
think
the
body
is
still
a
bit
on
the
heavier
side
this
is
still
a
really
good
drinking
beer
and
will
be
perfect
for
beer
lovers
on
new
years
this
was
definitely
an
experience
to
try
out
but
with
the
19
price
tag
i
dont
see
myself
picking
up
this
one
frequently
even
if
it
was
a
regular
brew
on
a
positive
note
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
got
through
about
13
of
the
bottle
and
wasnt
feeling
buzzed
at
all
d
aside
from
the
little
spot
of
alcohol
noted
on
the
finish
its
incredibly
well
hidden
it
drinks
ridiculously
easily
though
i
would
find
myself
on
the
fence
about
picking
it
up
again
at
20
i
will
admit
that
i
enjoyed
it
enough
that
i
do
find
myself
interested
in
another
plus
it
is
pretty
much
on
par
with
other
beers
of
the
style
as
far
as
cost
goes
perhaps
it
will
be
a
beer
of
choice
for
the
new
year
celebration
d
this
one
is
best
shared
with
a
group
of
people
its
definitely
a
nice
and
unique
beer
but
its
a
little
too
reminiscent
of
a
spiked
samuel
adams
boston
lager
i
realize
they
use
that
yeast
in
this
in
the
flavor
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
champagnelike
is
it
worth
the
20
price
tag
if
youve
gotta
try
it
splitting
a
bottle
with
a
few
people
would
be
the
way
to
go
maybe
ill
pick
up
one
more
bottle
for
new
years
well
see
notes
wasnt
too
sure
what
to
classify
this
as
so
i
went
with
their
description
while
being
an
exellent
brew
its
not
amazing
and
wouldnt
really
search
it
out
again
given
the
price
on
it
and
not
being
great
again
not
bad
in
any
sense
just
not
worth
the
hype
good
to
try
once
feel
free
to
request
a
change
of
style
if
you
think
theres
a
better
fit
NA
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
quite
refreshing
i
like
this
great
refreshment
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
short
lived
off
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
clear
at
first
with
both
big
and
small
bubble
trails
then
turns
a
hazy
amber
aroma
is
hop
yeast
malt
flavor
is
slightly
malt
sweet
some
hop
and
a
bit
of
tang
from
co2
body
itself
is
ok
but
the
carbonation
is
excellent
finish
is
like
flavor
and
slowly
tapers
off
session
beer
but
beware
serious
burpage
certainly
not
a
chugger
the
carbonation
levels
make
sure
of
that
any
briskpaced
drinking
is
pretty
much
impossible
but
then
again
this
isnt
the
beer
for
that
sort
of
drinking
anyway
this
beer
is
entirely
unique
and
tremendous
in
its
own
way
d
this
really
is
helluva
good
beer
if
only
i
havent
lost
a
third
of
it
due
to
improper
handling
my
third
champagne
beer
so
far
the
second
being
the
same
beer
in
a
clear
better
presentation
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
with
or
without
the
yeast
it
drinks
anything
but
identical
and
equally
nice
hight
recommended
for
those
taking
a
trip
to
praha
an
unusual
one
a
very
low
abv
biere
de
champagne
and
not
along
the
same
lines
as
say
deus
or
malheur
it
reminded
me
on
a
low
abv
wheat
beer
with
a
bit
more
fizz
a
really
interesting
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
cant
say
i
would
exactly
quaff
down
this
beer
as
i
did
in
many
other
places
in
the
czech
republic
however
it
was
thoroughly
drinkable
and
i
would
definitely
go
back
for
more
and
more
this
beer
is
bottle
only
i
had
it
at
the
brewpub
make
sure
you
ask
for
it
it
may
not
be
in
the
same
style
as
say
malhuer
brut
or
deus
but
it
is
closer
to
them
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
it
is
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
spritzy
head
that
dissipates
fast
the
aroma
is
citrussylemon
with
some
grain
and
tartness
is
apparent
it
tastes
floweryperfumy
with
some
citrus
zest
flavor
it
is
very
dry

a
spritzy

body
is

awesome

large

decanted
into

smells
like
a
hybrid
continental

quite
unique
although
the
aroma
was
subdued
overall
palate
was
also
quite
distinctive
and
surprising
a
solid
backbone
of
doughy
sweet
malts
propping
up
a
strong
gooseberry
hop
flavor
that
gathered
steam
over
the
course
of
the
session
and
some
mellow
yeastderived
phenols
there
is
quite
a
pronounced
residual
sweetness
that
almost
veers
into
cidery
territory
the
carbonation
is
much
lower

than
the

suggests
and
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
chalky

5as
a
belgian
beer
that
initial
unpleasantness
burns
off
soon
enough
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
o
i
like
it
and
im
confused
as
to
why
maybe
its
the
pleasantly
bubbly
mouthfeel
its
sweet
and
just
pleasant
really
i
bit
absolutely
no
chocolate
out
of
this
but
im
not
sure
i
had
the
same
beer
from
the
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
best
damn
beer
shop
in
san
diego
this
should
be
my
100th
beer
style
according
to
ba
drinkability
a
very
nice
beer
in
the
style
strong
ale
bière
de
champagne
o
this
beer
is
exquisite
full
stop
and
is
the
only
dark
version
of
this
style
that
i
know
of
the
benchmark
it
sets
and
difficult
to
beat
jd
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
colored
with
a
fizzy
beige
head
that
leaves
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
yeasty
fruity
the
flavor
is
pretty
tasty
with
prominent
yeast
and
spice
notes
earthy
with
some
alcoholic
warmth
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
enjoyed
this
good
for
splitting
several
ways
at
a
tasting
beer
is
light
in
body
and
a
little
earthy
spicy
on
the
palate
the
yeast
comes
through
nicely
as
well
ultimately
i
didnt
like
this
one
as
much
as
the
blonde
if
i
were
to
have
one
again
it
would
be
the
other
bière
de
champagne
bière
brut
a
nice
tasting
though
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
the
normal
brut
reserve
was
much
better
this
is
a
bit
blander
in
the
nose
and
a
bit
heavier
for
the
same
abv
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
and
would
choose
the
brut
reserve
over
this
one
for
sure
the
flavor
follows
a
similar
pattern
there
really
isnt
too
much
going
on
but
its
well
made
and
the
fruit
character
is
nice
lightmedium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
pretty
good
from
750
ml
bottle
into
malheur
chalicelike
tulip
dark
tudor
brown
in
color
approaching
black
offwhite
head
medium
retention
the
head
had
some
unique
champagne
like
activity
happening
i
assume
related
to
the
high
carbonation
causing
a
percolation
aroma
seems
sweet
malty
actually
is
smells
exactly
like
milk
duds
taste
is
sweet
also
milk
duddy
not
as
champagne
like
as
expected
high
carbonation
and
tongue
cleaning
but
lower
than
expected
for
brut
not
a
brut
guy
but
this
is
actually
pretty
freaking
awesome
overall
very
good
beer
only
the
high
price
36
is
negative
would
definitely
buy
it
again
for
a
special
occasion
different
take
on
a
biere
champagne
and
definitely
worth
a
try
apparently
this
bottle
is
two
years
past
it
prime
january
first
two
thousand
and
nine
forgot
about
this
baby
and
should
have
chocolate
on
hand
as
this
is
supposed
to
best
beer
in
the
world
to
have
chocolate
with
seems
like
a
big
boozy
quad
with
out
the
depth
of
the
great
quadruples
enjoyable
will
have
to
revisit
this
beer
when
i
come
across
it
again
overall
i
think
i
prefer
the
blonde
version
but
this
is
a
neat
mix
and
real
impressive
sense
of
flavors
smells
and
textures
for
a
beer
real
nice
a
beer
you
should
buy
and
try
i
am
going
to
have
this
beer
standard
in
my
stock
the
heat
of
the
booze
almost
masked
a
light
dusting
of
minerals
within
the
mouth
and
the
fleeting
stickiness
on
the
lips
the
carbonation
was
active
but
not
excessive
the
body
was
pretty
light
and
i
had
to
admit
that
it
did
seem
like
a
mix
of
champagne
and
beer
it
was
different
and
could
take
some
getting
used
to
but
i
was
liking
this
first
venture
into
one
of
the
newest
belgian
styles
dr
pairs
well
with
chocolate
very
drinkable
conceals
its
abv
quite
well
i
dont
know
the
price
point
as
it
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
but
i
suspect
its
quite
expensive
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
froth
in
the
bottle
had
actually
overflowed
spilled
out
a
little
in
the
fridge
and
left
a
semihard
honeycomb
like
nicesized
chunk
of
lace
around
the
rim
while
i
was
drinking
my
first
glass
bottle
opens
with
a
huge
resounding
pop
i
love
the
mushroom
corks
they
use
on
these
westy
12
like
in
appearance
thin
creamy
cobwebby
head
and
a
darkbrown
with
reddish
edges
im
immediately
comparing
this
to
some
great
belgian
quadruppels
specifically
rochefort
10
westy
12
maybe
st
bernardus
12
it
has
the
kind
of
blueberrylike
element
of
the
rochefort
the
beautiful
malt
and
dark
fruits
of
all
three
the
feel
is
a
touch
thin
not
boozy
very
lively
spritzy
deep
and
elegant
extremely
underrated
given
the
huge
appeal
this
should
have
for
anyone
who
likes
the
big
belgian
quads
clear
dark
burgundy
topped
by
a

this
beer
should
be
an
opidome
of
the
style
its
effortless
nature
at
such
complexity
is
astounding
the
balance
is
formitably
maltysweet
yet
complex
simply
a
joy
to
drink
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
to
have
to
celebrate
a
bachelor
party
with
on
a
yacht
but
protect
your
flat
screen
from
lamps
after
your
wife
finds
out
how
much
you
paid
for
the
bottle
but
seriously
its
a
good
beer
thats
worth
picking
up
for
new

something

up
for

boozy
finish
and
fairly
short
this
brew
is
interesting
and
fun
everyone
at
the
party
wanted
to
try
it
after
seeing
a
strange
brown
liquid
spew
out
of
an
unassuming
champagne
bottle
some
of
them
loved
it
some
of
them
didnt
for
me
generally
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
a
bit
pricey
this
is
yet
another
very
fine
beer
from
this
impressive
brewery
this
is
a
wonderful
rich
fruity
sipper
nicely
carbonated
with
a
sweet
effervescent
bodyflavor
estery
belgian
yeast
provides
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
flavor

dark
cherry
plum
grape
and
raisin
slight
roasty
chcolate
malt
and
minimal
hop
bitterness
abv
is
very
well
masked
dry
finish
the
one
thing
that
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
was
the
ton
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
i
thought
this
was
a
champagne
beer
pours
a
dak
cola
brown
to
light
black
hue
beneath
a
light
brown
that
swells
to
three
fingers
even
after
a
soft
pour
into
my
champagne
glass
very
unique
champagnelike
look
to
this
dark
brew
the
aroma
is
sweet
breads
light
chocolate
roasted
yeasty
fruit
and
a
little
smoke
very
complex
and
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
has
some
light
brown
and
chocolate
mixed
with
strong
pumpernickle
bread
just
some
greay
carbonation
from
start
to
finish
great
sipping
beer
with
a
sparse
warmth
that
is
a
little
off
putting
but
decptivly
delicious
and
elegant
the
great
bubbles
tickling
the
palate
add
to
the
dark
belgian
dubbel
and
chanpagne
quality
to
this
sipping
beer
a
very
tasty
tipple
that
morphed
quite
visibly
from
a
sparking
wineesque
drink
to
a
decent
strong
belgian
ale
as
it
warmed
this
went
very
well
with
some
of
my
girls
delectable

at
its

folks
this
750
ml
bottle
of

dark
brut
cost
25
99
at
that
price
needless
to
say
ill
never
buy
it
again
still
it
wasnt
a
waste
of
money
because
im
getting
a
great
deal
of
enjoyment
out
of
the
experience
if
you
love
the
bsda
style
and
recently
won
the
lottery
give
this
one
a
serious
look
this
was
a
good
beer
but
it
wasnt
great
and
at
this
price
i
think
it
is
fair
to
expect
greatness
would
be
fun
to
have
the
funds
to
cellar
a
few
for
several
years
but
alas
i
do
work
in
the
beer
industry
very
sweet
flavor
with
a
touch
of
hop
at
the
swallow
described
as
the
perfect
match
to
belgian
chocolate

how

drinkable
for
the
abv
because
i
think
it
is
interesting
postpalate
theres
some
heft
to
this
even
though
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
this
is
definitely
something
good
for
a
glass
or
two
on
occassion
but
a
full
bottle
should
be
shared
pours
a
deep

nice

quite

kind

flavor
quite
complex
and
interesting
the
brew
pours
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
tan
head
the
nose
has
dark
malts
and
crisp
hops
the
taste
is
super
rich
with
flavor
sweet
malts
sugar
dark
fruits
full
bodied
and
super
smoothe
very
refined
beer
i
would
definately
bathe
some
hot
hookers
in
this
beer
this
is
gorgeous
stuff
but
needs
to
shared
a
bottle
alone
to
oneself
is
quite
overwhelming
the
abv
really
sneaks
up
on
you
and
this
is
sweet
chocolatey
semivinous
stuff
that
gets
a
bit
overwhelming
as
well
after
a
while
a
perfect
way
to
cap
off
a
dinner
party
i
think
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sugary
fizzy
mineraly
with
bitterness
towards
the
end
first

with
a

effervescent

stained
my

with
the

lots

what
a

for
such
a

this

turned

clear

a

a
thin

lots
of

with
bready

alcohol

very

up

towards

alcohol
was
present
throughout
and
lingering
somewhat
but
it
stayed
restrained
and
balanced
mild
chocolate
and
milky
character
throughout
carbonation
was
very
high
a
little
too
high
for
me
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
texture
and
alcohol
warmth
a
pretty
good
drinker
with
a
light
chocolate
flavour
suited
for

dark

go

some
d
definitely
drinkablelight
and
refreshing
with
a
decently
complex
taste
a
good
beer
an
interesting
style
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
it
is
a
fairly
spendy
beer
there
are
much
better
beers
at
a
quarter
to
half
the
price
youll
pay
for
this
one
that
said
i
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
masterfully
executed
beer
d
this
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
moved
down
the
glass
it
needs
to
breath
before
it
can
be
fully
enjoyed
it
deserves
to
be
savored
and
is
an
unlikely
candidate
for
a
long
session
however
i
want
more
and
more
and
more
picked
up
for
a
ridiculously
cheap
sale
price
of
10
at
greens
this
750
ml
champagne
style
bottle
was
impressive
even
before
opening
the
loud
pop
while
pulling
out
the
cork
was
quite
a
bit
like
opening
a
champagne
but
the
burgundy
colored
liquid
with
a
large
foamy
head
looked
nothing
like
it
it
was
an
impressive
looking
beer
nonetheless
id
almost
call
is
a
cross
between
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
duvel
the
smell
was
quite
a
fruit
barrage
led
mainly
by
red
apples
and
followed
by
cherry
and
strawberry
the
taste
was
quite
a
bit
like
a
quadrupel
but
without
a
lot
of
the
intense
alcohol
the
fruits
detected
by
the
nose
were
here
with
some
raisins
thrown
in
earthy
and
spicy
hop
presence
was
detectable
amazingly
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
big
beer
with
a
creamy
and
dry
texture
that
just
glided
down
with
each
sip
felt
quite
a
bit
lighter
in
the
mouth
than
it
really
was
which
i
think
was
quite
an
intentional
effect
much
better
than
the
brut
reserve
in
my
opinion
as
this
one
tries
not
to
imitate
something
else
and
is
a
better
drink
as
a
result
i
just
loved
this
beer
and
am
jealous
of
anyone
who
can
take
advantage
of
the
ridiculously
low
price
at
whole
foods
austin
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
abundant
frothy
head
that
sprung
up
with
even
with
an
extremely
careful
pour
aroma
is
dried
fruits
and
burnt
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
is
a
very
complex
blend
of
dried
fruits
caramel
and
some
bakers
cocoa
the
beer
is
certainly
heavy
but
the
champagne
carbonation
does
a
nice
job
of
smoothing
things
out
this
one
while
smooth
and
refreshing
is
certainly
a
sipper
that
benefits
from
warming
drinkability
very
easy
to
lose
yourself
with
larger
than
needed
gulps
the
lighter
flavor
and
thinner
mouthfeel
make
this
strong
dark
belgian
a
danger
to
anyone
who
dosnt
know
of
the
abv
too
drinkable
for
the
strength
an
easy
beer
to
lose
track
of
the
bottle
was
gone
far
too
fast
this
really
needs
to
be
a
bit
more
tame
on
the
alcohol
front
to
be
really
good
sure
you
could
chill
the
hell
out
of
the
beer
and
that
would
reduce
the
alcohol
but
you
would
lose
so
much
of
the
fruit
malt
and
spice
character
then
at
over
25
a
bottle
it
wont
be
frequenting
my
cellar
or
my
shelf
which
is
too
bad
this
is
an
excellent
biere
brut
incredibly
complex
nose
with
sherry
vanilla
and
fine
wood
all
showing
up
oak
dry
taste
with
some
coffee
notes
balanced
bitterness
with
alcohol
zest
and
oak
drinkability
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
but
in
all
honesty
i
preferred
the
brut
reserve
for
the
price
and
packaging
a
rather
bland
and
uninspiring
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
very
champaign
like
reminds
me
of
a
big
brut
rose
in
hind
sight
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
creamy
kir
royal
great
beer
truly
unique
intoxicating
and
delicious
d
a
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
dark
belgian
a
nice
candy
sweetness
is
lightened
by
the
effervescence
and
prevents
the
beer
from
tasting
like
a
big
ale
i
appreciated
the
bier
brut
and
will
definitely
try
a
dark
brut
again
opinion
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
it
really
doesnt
reflect
its
color
in
the
taste
it
doesnt
have
hardly
any
of
the
caramel
sweetness
that
you
would
expect
from
such
a
dark
beer
the
assertive
hopping
make
this
beer
a
bit
hard
to
classify
as
well
it
is
a
nice
experience
and
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
with
like
a
beer
club
or
something
when
a
bunch
of
you
can
share
the
financial
hit
i
paid
over
25
for
this
bottle
and
am
drinking
it
by
myself
with
12
abv
i
will
surely
get
my
moneys
worth
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
but
i
knocked
it
on
the
drinkability
strictly
for
the
cost
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
medium
desnsity
very
active
tan
head
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
tannins
backed
by
a
pronounced
yeast
note
the
taste
is
very
intense
sweet
plums
and
dark
chocolate
the
finish
has
notes
of
orange
and
nutmeg
outstanding
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
effervescent
but
a
bit
thin
the
drinkability
is
great
there
is
an
alcolhol
warmth
to
the
finish
but
this
beer
really
masks
the
alcohol
well
if
you
like
belgian
brown
ales
and
if
you
like
good
champagne
definitly
try
this
if
you
can
afford
it
ouch
not
that
bad
unless
you
consider
the
26
price
tag
definitely
not
worth
that
inferior
to
the
ordinary

the
point
of
this
beer
the

it

a

i

this

beer
with

natural

presenting
themselves
this
has
a
dry
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
this
looks
like
it
should
be
an
overly
sweet
alcohol
bomb
whose
depth
is
entirely
based
on
esters
not
the
case
this
a
dry
complex
ale
thats
remarkably
drinkable
interesting
beer
not
as
crisp
as
the
regular
malheur
brut
but
with
a
little
more
character
the
dark
reddish
brown
body
is
topped
by
an
appropriate
light
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
good
bit
of
fruitiness
and
a
little
spice
but
the
chocolate
while
there
really
isnt
there
enough
to
justify
the
american
name
for
this
beer
this
one
seemed
a
little
lacking
compared
to
beers
that
came
before
and
after
it
at
the
tasting
o
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
great
aperitif
my
wife
picked
this
beer
up
for
me
from
the
local
beer
store
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
brew
has
the
typical
brut
appearance
light
golden
with
a
towering
head
the
head
was
far
more
stable
than
i
expected
and
the
beer
wasnt
quite
as
clear
as
it
could
be
but
its
still
very
attractive
protein
haze
the
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
its
not
really
remarkable
in
any
way
the
taste
however
is
spot
on
its
very
fruity
semidry
has
a
touch
of
pale
malt
flavor
and
a
characteristic
belgian
ester
quality
nice
the
finish
is
well
balanced
with
a

the

this

poured

with
a
white

of
fine

fair

with
some
spotty

same
in
the
flavour
along
with
very
light
bitterness
some
fruit
and
spicy
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
body
was
just
on
the
light
side
and
carbonation
was
quite
high
decent
texture
nicely
balanced
and
quite
refined
surprisingly
light
and
refreshing
considering
the
abv
thanks
jan
this
is
just
another
malheur
work
of
art
drinkability
is
good
balanced
light
and
very
refreshing
good
stuff
for
anyone
fortunate
enough
to
have
this
consider
yourself
lucky
keep
this
one
tucked
away
for
a
special
occasion
i
did
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
quite
classy
for
a
beer
glad
i
have
another
bottle
definitely
a
save
for
special
occasion
type
of
beer
taste
is
also
good
but
imo
litle
sweet
next
to
that
maltyness
alcohol
and
very
clean
bottom
fermented
like
yeastpalate
bitter
aftertaste
makes
this
one
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
maximum
carbonisation
and
the
full
palete
makes
this
one
to
something
extraordinary
in
mouthfeel
and
well
worth
revieuwing
it
as
my
500th
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
was
a
beer
saved
for
and
enjoyed
for
a
celebration
in
brief
today
we
both
received
our
first
residency
interview
invitations
at
the
same
place
thus
allowing
us
to
stay
together
throughout
the
remainder
of
our
training
highly
exciting
stuff
the
most
surprising
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
feel
it
is
shockingly
heavy
on
the
feel
but
gives
you
a
wonderful
drying
cleanliness
before
each
sip
is
gone
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
for
something
labeled
brut
the
driest
possible
form
of
champagne
this
is
a
brightly
and
cloyingly
sweet
drink
the
residual
sugars
are
high
along
with
that
big
booziness
suggesting
a
big
big
grain
bill
during
the
brewing
process
for
this
first
foray
into
the
style
we
are
pleased
but
not
wooed
this
was
a
nice
introduction
but
i
believe
we
would
prefer
something
a
bit
tamer
dryer
and
more
refined
stylistically
this
beer
is
supposed
to
beer
a
mix
between
a
champagne
wine
and
regular
beer
but
except
for
the
yeast
flavor
and
the
bottle
type
i
really
didnt
taste
the
link
with
a
champagne
it
is
a
decent
blond
beer
with
a
very
strong
carbonation
where
the
yeast
flavor
and
smell
champagne
yeast
is
very
dominant
as
is
the
style
highly
carbonated
had
to
wait
a
bit
for
it
to
settle
but
well
worth
the
wait
the
dry
hopped
flavor
is
really
on
show
bringing
out
a
character
not
unlike
a
double
ipa
definitely
recommended
if
you
have
not
tried
this
style
o
not
a
bad
biere
de
champagne
its
surprisingly
light
with
hidden
alcohol
especially
given
12
abv
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
enlightenment
brut
i
had
recently
though
i
doubt
id
get
this
one
again
this
one
is
a
little
drier
and
more
like
a
typical
champagne
i
will
say
the
beer
is
hazy
and
straw
yellow
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
lasting
white
head
the
aroma
brings
yeast
lemons
bready
malts
grass
smells
good
nice
flavor
as
well
easy
drinking
especially
considering
the
12
abv
bold
yeast
flavors
with
a
touch
of
hops
additional
notes
of
citrus
and
a
light
bready
sweetness
the
finish
is
dry
with
warming
alcohol
notes
overall
this
a
tasty
beer
i
would
have
it
again
beer
is
light
in
body
airy
on
the
palate
sweet
up
front
with
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
to
the
whole
thing
i
like
the
yeast
on
the
palate
probably
the
best
bière
de
champagne
bière
brut
ive
ever
had
i
might
even
have
it
again
o
overall
a
very
nice
crisp
beer
i
thought
it
was
more
like
7
so
was
surprised
to
see
such
a
high
abv
worth
checking
out
and
woul
revisit
it
pours
a
fairlyclear
strawgolden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
pear
melon
and
green
grapes
plenty
of
light
fruit
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
flavor
continues
down
the
same
path
with
the
fruit
in
the
front
a
bit
of
booze
on
the
back
end
light

pretty

jd
o
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
good
beer
just
not
worth
the
steap
price
tag
over
25
this
would
be
a
tough
buy
for
me
to
make
better
beers
to
spend
your
money
on
outside
of
this
style
my
wife
and
i
opened
this
to
toast
for
the
first
night
of
chanukah
malheur
was
a
great
decision
for
the
occasion
o
this
is
not
as
nice
as
the
deus
because
it
doesnt
have
enough
champagne
like
carachteristics
however
its
a
very
unusual
beer
and
well
worth
a
shot
overall
one
fantastic
drink
to
be
had
and
would
enjoy
to
have
again
dr
fairly
easy
drinking
fair
quality
and
rather
refreshing
high
price
od
no
alcohol
to
be
noticed
nice
beer
for
sure
i
was
suprised
by
the
drinkability
on
this
it
was
quite
tasty
great
beer
the
cpj
ws
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
because
of
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
which
make
drinkability
is
very
good
with
some
light
malts
and
sweetness
lots
of
bubbles
to
clear
the
palate
and
for
being
12
drinks
like
half
that
having
said
that
some
of
the
characters
here
seem
typical
of
poorly
aged
beer
while
i
think
that
a
12
bottle
should
hold
up
pretty
well
i
have
to
be
a
bit
more
generous
with
my
scores
than
i
would
otherwise
have
been
its
a
very
nice
belgian
brew
stylistically
i
think
its
a
little
faulty
especially
for
a
beer
which
calls
itself
a
bière
brut
not
even
a
bière
de
champagne
but
its
a
lovely
belgian
strong
pale
ale
very
drinkable
smooth
but
accentuated
with
the
characters
it
needs

very
pleasant

thats
interesting
white

mild

sweetness
sweeter
as
it
warms
champagneish
aftertaste
certainly
a
sipper
this
is
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
while
not
a
fan
personally
it
would
be
stupid
to
deny
its
greatness
drinkability
this
is
a
very
unique
experience
for
me
very
delicate
with
mellow
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
spice
if
you
can
pony
up
the
money
this
is
a
fun
diversion
from
more
familiar
styles
more
robust
in
sweetness
and
body
than
most
belgian
strong
pale
ales
but
with
the
upmost
carbonation
of
champagne
this
beer
begs
for
a
celebration
of
some
sort
750ml
bottle
cork
comes
off
with
a
bang
so
impressive
i
actually
created
a
thread
about
the
experience
vinous
aroma
of
soft
yeast
lemon
and
hay
actually
captures
some
of
the
magic
that
the
old
dulle
teve
750ml
gave
with
cobwebs
lemon
and
a
brilliant
yeast
strain
here
the
nuances
are
just
a
bit
young
but
are
still
interesting
enough
to
really
enjoy
it
has
a
stale
kind
of
finish
that
could
be
drier
and
shorter
otherwise
this
is
fantastic
d
hefty
at
11
but
expertly
concealed
bière
de
champagne
is
delicious
and
this
is
my
recommended
brand
an
experience
never
to
be
missed
ive
never
heard
of
this
style
before
but
i
really
like
the
beer
its
a
lot
like
a
blond
ale
in
color
but
i
guess
a
lot
stronger
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
flavor
is
quite
good
and
unique
a
little
sour
but
generally
a
great
pale

color

yellow
amber
aroma
is
spicy
yeast
malt
and
a
hint
of
skunk
hop
it
is
a
green
bottle
and
i
kept
it
out
of
the
light
so
maybe
it
got
a
little
light
struck
at
the
store
flavor
is
like
aroma
minus
the
skunk
and
much
sweeter
in
fact
the
sweetness
dominates
body
is
decent
and
good
carbonation
finish
is
a
little
more
bittersweet
than
sweet
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
pours
cloudy
dirty
gold
gobs
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
which
manifests
itself
in
a
giant
white
head
lots
of
lacing
and
retention
in
the
foam
with
large
beads
leaving
my
glass
almost
looking
like
a
bubble
bath
with
hills
of
foam
and
clusters
of
bubbles
strewn
across
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
spicy
esters
that
mingle
with
alcohol
causing
a
bit
of
tingle
in
the
nose
a
bit
vinous
ala
champagne
plus
maybe
clove
and
apple
skins
the
flavor
at
first
has
pears
or
cider
fruity
yet
tart
big
spicy
yeast
notes
and
alcohol
on
the
midpalate
then
a
very
dry
and
bready
finish
the
belgian
yeast
lends
most
of
the
flavor
to
this
beer
so
tart
and
spicy
fruits
are
the
name
of
the
game
body
is
moderate
with
lots
of
creamy
carbonation
the
bubbles
bleed
out
fairly
quickly
i
like
it
better
as
the
bubbles
calm
down
though
it
seems
to
almost
go
flat
this
is
fairly
tasty
once
my
palate
acclimatizes
to
the
tart
yeast
character
and
i
can
appreciate
the
spice
and
fruit
subtleties

the
aroma
leads
me
to
think
this
one
is
going
to
be
yeasty
maybe
even
slight
fruity
but
with
a
dry
character
the
appearance
is
hazy
golden
with
a
large
head
and
lots
of
lace
the
taste
is
dry
and
slightly
yeasty
but
no
real
fruit
to
speak
of
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
large
price
tag
i
think
its
not
worth
the
price
but
i
think
its
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
some
this
was
the
first
malheur
beer
i
tried
and
it
was
presented
with
much
flair
at
a
dallas
steakhouse
they
treated
the
presentation
with
the
same
care
as
that
of
a
fine
wine
so
i
was
a
little
less
put
off
than
my
original
concern
of
the
high
price
tag
poured
into
snifters
in
small
amounts
the
beer
was
a
turbulent
dark
brown
with
a
white
fine
head
that
left
some
good
lacing
as
we
enjoyed
the
aroma
of
this
was
so
complex
that
it
seemed
to
change
as
the
beer
went
down
started
with
dark
fruit
of
raisins
and
prunes
and
ended
with
a
long
malt
flavor
that
had
a
great
full
mouthfeel
the
natural
carbonation
was
light
and
complimented
the
style
well
i
will
look
around
for
more
malheur
beers
for
sure
but
certainly
to
enjoy
at
home
considering
the
price
this
was
certainly
a
beer
to
remember
for
it
complexity
and
fine
flavors
it
was
reminiscent
of
champagne
and
was
very
enjoyable
the
beer
pours
a
striking
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
on
the
nose
i
get
some
honey
and
light
lemonlime
which
really
smells
very
nice
flavors
replicate
the
nose
except
theres
a
decided
sweet
ice
tea
flavor
that
adds
to
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
which
tends
to
give
the
moderately
sweet
flavor
profile
a
certain
lightness
it
might
not
have
otherwise
alcohol
is
very
well
disguised
and
drinkability
is
very
very
good
wow
this
is
really
pretty
nice
impressive
a
very
tasty
solid
and
warmly
effervescent
quaff
highly
suitable
for
all
your
celebratory
needs
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
enjoyable
enough
to
justify
the
price
next
time
ill
stick
with
the
much
more
enjoyable
dark
brut
as
the
base
beer
they
use
in
that
one
malheur
12
survives
the
bottle
conditioning
much
better
brought
a
bottle
back
from
belgium
where
it
wasnt
crazy
expensive
in
a
nutshell
this
beer
was
like
a
belgian
sugar
cookie
in
a
glass
theres
a
strong
but
not
too
rich
bready
sweet
cookie
flavor
with
hints
of
cinnamon
sugar
candy
and
a
hint
of
lime
this
is
very
very
drinkable
while
being
pleasantly
complex
if
this
beer
werent
25
id
definitely
drink
more
not
a
bad
introduction
to
the
style
if
this
is
past
the
best
by
date
then
i
wonder
what
its
like
before
it
id
like
to
try
the
dark
version
of
this
one
w
chocolate
recommended
i
couldnt
drink
this
fast
enough
flavor
was
appledriven
with
a
nice
breadiness
a
little
spice
and
minor
pilz
notes
i
detected
soft
butter
nuts
a
little
banana
and
coriander
this
is
exceptionally
wellcrafted
and
im
just
sorry
i
didnt
buy
at
least
6
bottles
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
smooth
to
light
crispiness
in
the
end
which
equals
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
definite
good
drinkability
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
d
alcohol
content
well
hidden
so
one
must
be
careful
overall
i
was
impressed
and
will
hopefully
try
a
few
more
of
this
style
im
happy
with
paying
10
dollars
for
this
but
the
25
price
tag
ive
heard
others
speak
of
seems
a
bit
steep
drinkability
i
am
seriously
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
have
had
biere
brut
before
and
especially
like
the
deus
but
this
being
less
than
ok
was
unexpected
normally
i
like
sour
notes
and
love
beers
with
them
didnt
expect
the
malheur
to
be
a
sour
beer
but
would
have
welcomed
it
it
was
paired
with
a
parmesan
risotto
cake
atop
loch
duart
salmon
in
a
roasted
garlic
cream
sauce
which
was
made
with
the
beer
and

the

reminds
me
of
a

at

i
may
have
held

this

the

out
the
exotic

that

you

it
is
not

barely
but
it
is
one
amazing

a

and
i
would
have
this
every
week
quite
an

alcohol

reasonably
wellcovered
for

though
it
does
show
some

do
prefer
this
to
the

i
thought

for

d
the

alcohol
is
pretty
well

for

overall
a
very
refined
belgian
that
drinks
like
a
champagne
a
tasty
beer
and
a
first
of
for
the
style
for
me
the
cork
was
easily
extracted
and
as
soon
as
it
was
freed
the
beer
started
to
foam
upwards
in
the
bottle
the
process
continued
in
the
duvel
tulip
glass
forming
a
big
foamy
head
occupying
half
of
the
space
the
beer
itself
looked
cloudy
pale
golden
and
airy
the
aroma
was
very
yeasty
and
bready
and
some
floral
smells
lingered
on
tasted
peppery
sweet
musty
and
phenolic
and
semi
dry
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
i
was
surprised
to
glance
up
at
the
listing
to
see
11
put
up
there
not
as
clean
as
i
would
have
liked
in
the
finish
as
some
metallic
bitterness
lurked
in
there
airy
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
bit
too
rich
for
my
waller
at
the
regular
price
but
the
sale
was
sweet
indeed
my
first
brouwerij
de
landsheer
beer
is
a
beauty
biere
brut
brut
reserve
is
everything
that
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
and
more
the
price
tag
will
probably
keep
me
from
buying
it
again
but
im
ecstatic
that
i
threw
caution
to
the
wind
and
brought
a
bottle
home
tres
magnifique
bottle
poured
a
hazy
deep
golden
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
notes
with
some
weird
ester
or
maybe
its
the
yeast
but
something
is
surely
different
taste
is
sweeter
and
lighter
then
expected
with
some
sweet
malt
and
light
yeasty
bready
finish
body
was
full
with
some
low
filtration
and
some
great
carbonation
alcohol
is
not
apparent
which
is
quite
surprising
considering
the
11
contained
in
this
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
but
considering
the
price
tag
it
is
unlikely
i
will
try
this
again
overall
a
very
nice
beer
good
for
special
occasions
champagnelike
very
drinkable
and
has
an
undetectable
abv
which
is
dangerous
very
versatile
with
food
highly
recommend
this
one
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
if
it
was
5
a
bottle
but
it
is
not
didnt
really
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
in
this
one
the
price
puts
it
out
of
the
range
of
a
beer
that
i
would
have
the
pleasure
of
drinking
regularly
but
it
was
very
nice
to
try
it
get
a
bottle
and
celebrate
with
some
friends
pours
a
clouded
straw
with
a
big
white
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
flavor
is
very
champagne
like
and
smooth
but
there
is
also
that
level
of
belgian
ale
that
is
ohsoobvious
lots
of
sugar
good
bit
of
what
seems
like
hops
feel
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
it
and
it
feels
pretty
soft
on
the
mouth
definitely
drinkable
but
more
so
a
sipper
i
have
been
keen
on
finding
another
good
biere
de
champagne
after
trying
deus
and
this
is
the
first
one
that
has
made
it
worth
the
money
i
kind
of
feel
like
this
is
duvel
on
speed
that
consistent
and
steady
ride
that
doesnt
really
take
you
anywhere
mind
blowing
but
its
still
pretty
damn
good
drinkability
a
refined
elegant
drink
not
sullied
one
single
bit
by
the
fact
that
is
was
served
alongside
pork
rinds
truly
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
drunk
in
quantity
to
really
enjoy
i
would
have
written
this
off
as
a
really
good
beer
but
not
great
if
i
had
not
had
multiple
glasses
of
this
brew
i
really
cant
ask
any
more
of
either
the
appearance
especially
if
i
had
poured
it
out
all
at
once
or
the
palate
of
this
beer
it
really
is
just
spot
on
for
this
brew
awesome
champagnelike
mouthfeel
with
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
good
stuff
great
aroma
but
definately
a
special
occasion

due
to
the
extreme
price

i
was
in
a
good
mood
just
got
a

at
work
otherwise
this
is
totally
not
worth
it
notes
pretty
good
i
will
have
to
venture
into
this
style
now
that
this
has
opened
my
mind
my
biggest
turn
off
was
the
grainy
wheat
frontside
biggest
upside
was
its
amazing
depth
and
out
of
the
box
type
brewing
mouthfeeldrinkability
much
like
a
fine
champagne
the
crisp
mouthfeel
becomes
more
gentle
after
the
initial
swell
all
of
the
flavors
distribute
nicely
to
various
parts
of
the
tongue
presenting
a
balanced
show
of
hops
spice
and
gigantic
malty
sugars
again
my
only
real
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
strength
as
an
aperitif
it
wore
me
out
a
bit
early
this
evening
bb

perfect
presentation
with
a
good
and
lasting
head
clear
pale
golden
beer
and
bubbles
that
just
keep
on
pearling
up
very
good
nose
also
giving
lots
of
hops
and
malts
and
overal
very
enjoyable
as
is
taste
being
dry
and
bitter
with
slight
maltnote
yes
this
is
a
wonderfull
brew
to
celebrate
a
good
occasion
with
lovely
beer
that
has
unbelievable
amount
of
co2
and
makes
mouthfeel
as
a
real
champagne
easy
drinkable
and
highly
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
an
all
around
excellent
beer
i
really
have
no
complaints
about
this
beer
except
for
it
is
not
in
my
fridge
at
this
moment
ill
have
to
do
something
about
that
this
is
a
lovely
beer
that
i
encourage
everyone
to
try
i
remember
liking
this
beer
now
im
infatuated
maybe
its
just
the
booze
talking
but
im
in
a
state
of
pure
adulation
this
beers
reminds
me
of
a
gueze
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
the
label
said
brut

golden
body
with
a
huge
spectacular
carbonation

enormous

keeps
climbing
the
glass
sides
instead
of
going
down
and
this
lasts
for
a
good
2
minutes
aroma

yeasty
it
does

superb

tickling
the

as
soon

the

hay
compenents
get
transported
everywhere
in
the
mouth
the
dry
bitterness
hits
immediatly
and
develops
in
a
complex
manner
during
the
long
finish
it
didnt
seem
all
that
complex
in
mouth
though
no
alcohol
gets
felt
ever
but
this
is
warming
all
the
way
through
a
masterpiece
of
the

art
cheers
martin
i
was
most
fortunate
to
purchase
a
few
bottles
of
this
while
in
brussels
for
about
10
euros
and
i
think
that
is
a
steal
after
trying
my
first
it
is
a
hazy
golden
color
and
a
big
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
part
fruity
and
part
delicate
earthy
hops
i
think
it
is
very
complex
some
of
the
tastes
i
noticed
were
peach
apricot
and
vanilla
it
finishes
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
despite
a
hefty
abv
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
whole
750
ml
bottle
in
by
myself
as
i
did
not
want
to
share
my
new
found
treasure
love

licorice

pepper
more

the

is

very

after
1015
minutes
in
the
smell
appears
hints
of
sour
black
cherry
and
strawberry
and
pepper
more
strong
this
beer
is
very
complex
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
even
with
the
alcool
not
very
low
aftertaste
bitter
of
hop
very
pleasant
the
taste
and
mostly
the
flavour
changes
a
lot
at
the
rise
of
the
temperature
growing
again
the
complexity
of
this
very
interesting
beer
then
rise
again
spices
a
beer
absolutely
to
taste
even
if
it
is
a
little
expensive
how
you
can
do
if
the
drinkability
is
high
nothing
really
champagne
like
at
all
as
others
suggest
still
very
big
and
powerful
heavy
mouthfeel
with
some
detergent
flavour
with
some
peppery
alcohol
like
many
tripels
in
fact
this
reminded
me
of
a
blend
between
westmalle
tripel
chimay
white
and
orval
complex
and
rich
yet
i
dont
really
think
they
pulled
this
one
off
as
well
as
they
could
have
still
a
nice
one
though
drinkability
notes
a
bit
champagne
like
but
with
the
beer
qualities
there
is
no
confusion
this
is
beyond
duvel
and
the
like
not
better
just
more
complex
maybe
perhaps
but
it
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
to
celebrate
with
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
thick
amount
of
bubbly
champagnelike
head
tart
fruit
aromas
are
most
dominate
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
very
nice
belgian
brew
with
some
candi
sugar
like
sweetness
citrusy
tanginess
and
a
good
mouth
filling
sweetness
was
expecting
less
than
i
got
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
very
intriguiging
beer
that
is
worth
checking
out
at
least
once
not
something
to
make
a
session
beer
out
of
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
foggy
orange
color
the
head
is
mountainous
frothy
long
lasting
and
fine
sheets
of
lace
cover
the
glass
nose
malt
fruit
sweet
to
me
the
aroma
of
over
ripe
plums
tart
not
bad
mind
you
just
something
unexpected
front
is
malt
sweet
the
top
is
middling
and
the
finish
is
potently
acidic
beneficently
hopped
with
a
sweet
and
sour
long
lasting
aftertaste
quite
complex
also
the
large
abv
gives
a
nice
tummy
warming
feeling
a
very
interesting
beer
normally
something
that
i
dont
think
would
be
high
on
my
list
but
i
do
have
a
few
bottles
aging
away
so
lets
see
what
i
think
next
year
and
the
year
after
so
basically
it
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
this
champagne
beer
is
filtered
whereas
most
other
belgian
ales
are
not
big
deal
right
well
except
that
this
even
more
so
than
the
regular
malheur
brut
really
is
a
phenomenal
beer
marketing
garb
or
unique
fermentation
process
aside
something
like
this
would
be
perfect
for
everyday
consumption
if
not
for
price
and
rarity
this
limited
edition
dryhopped
version
however
is
worth
spending
money
on
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
ale
with
a
gigantic
foamy
head
with
perfect
retention
and
some
excellent
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
notes
with
light
warming
alcohol
with
some
dry
floral
hops
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
alcohol
notes
with
some
warming
alcohol
notes
and
some
dry
alcohol
notes
with
light
herbal
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
super
great
carbonation
and
light
warming
alcohol
notes
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
the
dry
hopping
but
still
quite
the
experience
o
an
austrian
champagnebeer
yes
please
serving
type
bottle
i
finally
had
to
slurp
through
the
foam
to
get
to
the
beer
tickling
my
nose
in
the
process
the
taste
was
dry
champagnelike
brut
but
beery
too
for
it
was
thick
and
malty
to
match
a
really
lemony
flavor
a
wow
beer
