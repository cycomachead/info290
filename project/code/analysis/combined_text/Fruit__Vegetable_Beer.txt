its
apple
alright
lol
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
beer
more
like
hard
cider
like
many
others
have
commented
about
this
beer
i
got
a
six
pack
for
free
from
a
friend
and
wanted
to
see
what
the
hype
was
about
this
beer
is
for
the
folks
who
want
to
drink
a
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
not
a
fan
of
this
one
i
hate
to
give
this
beer
a
bad
rating
but
i
just
dont
like
this
type
of
beer
think
of
it
as
apple
juice
mix
with
a
little
sour
sour
apple
and
carbonation
thats
what
this
beer
taste
like
just
too
much
going
on
to
drink
more
than
one
i
cant
see
why
anyone
would
want
a
apple
flavored
beer
ever
but
this
beer
has
just
a
hint
of
apple
flavor
all
the
flavors
are
good
the
apple
strawberry
tea
all
of
them
good
the
only
thing
bad
i
would
say
is
that
you
can
only
buy
the
specialty
flavors
in
a
variety
pack
and
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
you
would
need
more
then
the
12
pack
to
get
there
one
of
my
favorite
beers
like
many
others
i
do
like
this
beer
although
it
does
lean
more
towards
a
hard
cider
one
or
two
at
the
most
are
enjoyable
within
a
short
time
span
this
stuff
is
absolutely
garbage
strange
taht
i
kept
going
back
for
more
trying
to
taste
the
alcohol
could
not
find
it
very
good
apple
drink
the
hidden
alcohol
is
cleverly
hidden
by
sweetness
and
apples
i
better
stop
now
that
swishy
way
is
goes
down
to
easy
is
bad
i
could
drink
these
fast
if
i
didnt
know
better
too
easy
to
drink
fast
awesome
taste
goes
down
like
apple
juice
very
nice
very
refreshing
clean
crisp
apple
flavors
come
across
simple
non
complex
in
flavor
enjoyed
several
of
them
and
would
buy
again
not
a
typical
beer
more
like
a
hard
cider
my
drink
of
choice
anytime
its
not
the
best
beer
okay
it
doesnt
quite
taste
like
a
beer
it
doesnt
quite
taste
like
a
hard
cider
but
yknow
what
its
pretty
good
for
what
its
trying
to
be
a
sweet
alcoholic
beverage
that
tastes
like
apple
but
isnt
just
another
cider
it
does
that
pretty
well
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
at
all
but
i
havent
had
a
good
apple
beer
out
of
the
three
or
four
that
i
have
tried
i
got
this
on
a
lark
just
because
i
wanted
something
a
little
fruity
and
as
i
was
at
a
diner
that
serves
beer
and
everything
else
was
your
typical
light
beer
fare
i
thought
id
give
this
weak
miller
product
a
try
the
color
is
a
light
golden
very
fizzy
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
of
tinny
apple
and
the
taste
is
similar
very
light
and
carbonated
with
a
watery
mix
of
water
and
beer
maybe
actually
it
tasted
all
right
for
what
it
is
not
awful
not
good
either
i
would
have
a
hard
time
calling
this
a
vegetable
ale
or
even
a
beer
at
all
however
as
a
swede
living
in
america
ive
been
looking
for
something
that
tastes
like
a
scandinavianstyled
cider
for
quite
some
time
this
might
be
it
very
sweet
sufficiently
tasty
incredibly
carbonated
awful
beer
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
glorified
fruitvegetable
beer
at
best
reminds
me
more
of
a
seagrams
more
than
anything
else
its
certainly
better
than
its
strawberry
ale
counterpart
but
not
by
much
overall
its
tasty
not
much
of
a
beer
really
but
it
does
go
good
with
some
firebally
uhhhh
it
tastes
crappy
like
a
stale
apple
juice
with
a
kick
crappity
crap
crap
crap
crap
overall
while
it
is
not
a
very
good
beer

smells

mixed

the

despite
being
weak
the
mouthfeel
stuck
with
me
and
took
over
everything

it
left
almost
a

the

wasnt

certainly
not

25thin
and
watery
with
too
much
carbonation
this
is
terrible
im
sure
it
would
seem
even
worse
if
i
drank
it
side
by
side
with
new
glarus
apple
ale
but
as
a
beer
beers
this
could
have
been
really
good
we
had
a
cider
press
when
i
was
a
kid
and
threw
the
old
apples
in
and
squeezed
the
juice
out
and
let
them
ferment
this
could
have
had
that
kind
of
taste
but
missed
it
not
bad
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
could
have
been
so
much
better
well
stale
bread
is
what
is
used
for
panini
and
rotten
apples
is
the
smell
of
cider
so
im
not
sure
how
that
stands
as
a
complaint
i
feel
like
beer
advocate
has
a
lot
of
folks
lining
up
to
prove
themselves
to
the
beer
community
but
this
is
a
weird
place
to
do
it
this
beer
is
drinkable
in
the
right
circumstances
but
hardly
the
new
bold
flavor
we
beer
snobs
are
seeking
still
i
dont
get
all
the
hate
finishes
smooth
with
crispness
very

a

very

overly

mouthfeel

overall
im
glad
i
didnt
purchase
this
myself
but
i
was
curious
to
try
it
i
did
drink
the
entire
bottle
but
i
didnt
enjoy
it
too
much
as
i
finish
this
review
there
are
good
points
to
this
beer
the
color
is
good
as
well
as
me
being
able
to
hold
it
down
however
the
taste
and
smell
of
it
would
make
me
drink
a

im
not
saying
its
a
good
fruit
beer
nor
is
it
a
bad
one
but
they
could

to
make
it
the
way
the

it

you
could
have
a

beer

you
could

i
think
i
overrated
this
this
is
horrible
is
this
beer
or
a
sweet
fruity
malt
beverage
im
leaning
towards
the
latter
here
we
go
redds
the
commercials
are
funny
the
beer
is
an
apple
ale
a
combination
of
an
ale
with
natural
apple
flavor
and
caramel
color
fizzy
white
head
dwindles
to
nothing
in
no
time
at
all
large
bubbled
fizzy
carbonation
disappears
in
literally
no
time
at
all
apple
juice
looking
body
aroma
apple
hand
soap
or
shampoo
with
tart
sliced
natural
apple
flavoring
no
real
signs
of
beer
its
not
a
cider
in
my
best
arnold
from
kindergarten
cop
its
not
a
tumor
voice
its
redds
apple
ale
dammit
the
flavor
is
of
stale
beer
and
natural
apples
is
not
overwhelming
nor
is
it
beer
its
pseudo
cider
when
i
grow
up
i
want
to
be
made
of
real
fuji
apples
not
some
concentrated
apple
flavoring
that
was
naturally
made
in
a
chemistry
lab
body
is
light
with
fizzy
carbonation
really
not
offensive
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
this
was
as
tasty
as
any
of
the
angry
orchard
or
more
established
ciders
out
there
however
its
just
not
its
a
miller
fabrication
brewed
by
redds
brewing
co
in
albany
ga
rating
this
as
a
fruit
beer
what
a
joke
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
apple
juice
amber
with
very
little
head
but
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
a
light
apple
juice
and
an
unidentifiable
somehwhat
offputting
vegetable
odor
it
might
be
the
light
malt
interacting
to
the
apple
in
a
way
that
i
was
not
expecting
flavor
is
mild
hard
apple
cider
mixed
with
light
sweet
malt
the
same
oddly
flavored
interaction
between
the
malt
and
the
apple
juice
flavors
affects
the
taste
as
well
light
bodied
the
flavor
combination
did
not
work
for
me
but
fortunately
it
is
all
so
attenuated
in
flavor
that
it
is
not
difficult
to
finish
i
was
also
lucky
that
we
got
our
first
really
warm
day
so
a
cheap
light
tasting
16
oz
can
filled
a
niche
in
the
day
i
was
fooled
into
to
buying
this
beer
from
the
new
brewery
redds
brewing
i
now
know
this
is
one
the
of
the
many
bmg
fake
brewery
names
the
good
news
is
that
at
least
i
have
reviewed
my
first
miller
product
tick
glad
i
did
this
one
after
mowing
the
grass
it
was
at
least
refreshing
while
dehydrated
at
first
taste
i
was
disgusted
but
it
was
because
i
was
expecting
almost
like
a
very
sweet
wine
cooler
but
i
was
hit
instead
with
what
tasted
like
somebody
mixed
a
miller
with
apple
juice
it
takes
a
couple
swallows
to
get
used
to
the
taste
after
a
bit
the
flavor
starts
mixing
a
lot
better
definitely
tastes
like
a
cider
i
like
the
sharp
feeling
carbonation
making
the
mouth
feel
rating
for
me
very
high
nothing
great
overall
but
its
not
half
bad
the
redd
apple
ale
was
a
light
coloring
an
smelled
fruity
especially
of
apples
and
a
little
kick
of
citrus
i
liked
it
because
it
did
not
taste
exactly
like
beer
and
it
was
very
sweet
it
had
a
good
cider
taste
to
it
and
the
mothfeel
was
good
as
well
this
was
another
single
bottle
purchase
i
notices
at
kroger
i
would
not
buy
this
again
because
im
not
a
big
fan
of
sweet
andor
fruit
flavor
beer
and
this
was
just
that
personally
i
wouldcould
drink
no
more
than
one
or
two
in
recession
i
am
also
unaware
of
the
nutrients
but
i
would
imagine
it
would
turn
me
further
away
if
i
have
anything
good
to
say
about
it
its
that
the
appearance
was
good
enough
to
get
me
to
buy
it
im
glad
i
got
it
on
sale
ill
keep
it
in
the
fridge
for
when
my
brother
in
law
comes
over
hell
drink
anything
this
is
what
it
claims
to
be
its
apple
through
and
through
its
a
bit
tart
and
tastes
exactly
like
apple
cider
it
achieves
what
it
set
out
to
achieve
but
ill
definitely
pass
in
the
future
overall
i
am
not
sure
what
part
of
this
is
actually
an
ale
this
tastes
exactly
like
a
sweet
hard
cider
to
me
not
bad
but
more
sweet
cider
like
then
beer
like
that
is
for
sure
overall
its
really
not
as
bad
as
i
had
anticipated
refreshing
for
the
summer
but
still
not
as
good
as
a
cider
drink
it
before
it
warms
if
you
want
a
cider
get
a
better
cider
if
you
want
a
beer
dont
get
this
its
not
so
bad
that
i
dont
recommend
you
ever
try
it
but
i
cant
say
that
i
will
get
it
again
pass
why
is
this
even
considered
beer
if
you
want
something
like
this
go
with
a
higherend
apple
cider
or
perry
not
this
apple
flavored
ale
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
straw
coloring
with
no
head
and
a
ton
of
carbonation
bubbling
aromas
of
apple
sweetness
with
not
much
else
behind
it
cloying
oversweet
nose
flavors
of
apple
tart
and
sweetness
with
a
slide
unbalance
to
the
sweet
side
leans
itself
more
towards
a
cider
than
an
ale
based
on
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
spiced
with
light
cinnamon
but
the
apple
tart
and
sweetness
overtakes
anything
as
you
drink
sweet
cloying
finish
that
is
lightened
by
the
carbonation
the
sweetness
builds
as
you
drink
which
can
overpower
and
make
this
beer
difficult
to
session
the
beer
pours
a
normal
macro
pale
yellow
color
with
an
almost
nonexistant
white
head
it
smells
like
a
regular
light
beer
with
lots
of
adjunct
and
a
hint
of
apple
tastes
like
someone
poured
apple
juice
in
my
keystone
light
thats
about
it
on
the
flavor
it
has
a
light
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
well
i
could
drink
more
of
these
but
wouldnt
really
want
to
the
guy
that
owns
my
local
beer
store
suckered
me
into
to
buying
the
16oz
can
overall
i
was
excited
about
it
and
hyped
up
due
to
the
positive
appearance
and
smell
but
it
stops
there
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
look
at
and
smell
without
the
intention
of
drinking
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
redds
thoroughly
disappointed
will
not
buy
or
drink
again
shame
on
you
miller
for
tricking
me
into
buying
a
nasty
hard
cider
o
not
sure
why
this
is
not
a
cider
or
malt
beverage
like
smirnoff
ice
as
this
tastes
and
smells
just
like
apple
juice
without
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
i
would
likely
never
have
another
one
of
these
as
it
seems
like
it
is
not
a
beer
at
all
even
though
they
market
it
as
a
beer
with
the
crispness
of
apples
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
this
being
dangerous
to
folks
how
get
it
knowing
they
do
not
like
beer
rjt
my
girlfriend
says
it
tastes
more
like
an
apple
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
i
agree
i
know
i
know
on
a
hot
day
sorry
id
rather
have
a
chilled
glass
of
real
apple
juice
avoid
overall
an
averageslightly
less
than
average
brew
i
might
not
turn
one
down
when
offered
but
i
seriously
doubt
ill
ever
buy
it
myself
if
i
am
looking
for
the
apple
flavor
ill
stick
to
woodchuck
or
angry
orchard
onot
good
its
a
watery
apple
mess
that
has
neither
good
beer
or
fruit
flavor
not
even
worth
trying
i
give
this
a
1
25
overall
because
it
doesnt
taste
terrible
i
can
see
nonbeer
drinkers
or
people
who
opt
for
sweet
gross
mixed
drinks
when
they
go
out
giving
redds
a
try
and
enjoying
it
as
for
everyone
else
skip
it
and
go
for
a
hard
cider
or
something
if
you
are
looking
for
an
apple
fix
o
not
enjoyable
overall
very
unimpressive
and
not
very
refreshing
if
you
want
sparkling
apple
juice
there
are
much
better
options
than
this
if
you
want
beer
this
isnt
going
to
do
it
for
you
saw
this
beer
as
a
super
bowl
ad
and
was
surprised
to
see
it
in
the
store
the
next
day
the
beer
in
my
bottle
looks
nothing
like
the
beer
on
display
here
mine
is
a
bright
golden
color
the
smell
is
of
cider
it
tastes
like
perhaps
an
apple
shandy
that
is
it
tastes
like
cider
and
beer
mixed
together
it
was
not
unpleasent
but
i
enjoy
beer
with
more
body
and
hops
o
there
are
really
no
beery
qualities
to
this
whatsoever
even
as
a
cider
its
fairly
awful
the
cider
market
does
seem
poised
to
explode
but
really
this
is
solidly
in
the
malternative
category
anyway
why
market
it
as
a
beer
at
all
it
makes
no
sense
to
me
overall
not
a
great
smelling
or
looking
beer
but
has
an
ok
if
sweet
taste
obviously
trying
to
capture
some
of
the
non
beer
drinking
crowd
for
that
purpose
get
a
real
cider
instead
of
this
one
my
wife
picked
up
a
single
bottle
as
part
of
a
makeyour
own
six
pack
she
was
almost
interested
in
trying
it
she
doesnt
like
beer
and
then
i
opened
the
bottle
took
a
whiff
and
the
overwhelming
stench
of
apple
cider
vinegar
assaulted
my
nose
i
allowed
it
to
come
up
in
temp
a
few
degrees
and
the
flavor
got
far
worse
way
too
fizzy
pale
yellow
and
like
one
other
reviewer
stated
i
think
it
actually
gave
me
a
low
grade
migraine
i
only
rated
it
at
a
1
because
there
isnt
a
0
or
less
than
a
1
ugh
i
rank
this
in
the
why
did
we
waste
the
money
category
im
not
sure
what
possessed
me
to
make
this
purchase
but
here
we
have
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
golden
liquid
with
a
small
smattering
of
white
bubbles
that
disappears
almost
instantly
the
aroma
is
initially
sulfur
and
apples
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
its
hard
to
find
anything
ale
like
in
the
aroma
this
smells
like
an
alcopop
cider
the
flavor
is
wow
pretty
bad
actually
brown
sugar
mixed
with
apple
flavoring
and
a
headache
inducing
artificial
sweetener
flavor
that
i
cant
get
out
of
my
mouth
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sickly
artificial
mouthfeel
i
couldnt
finish
this
i
was
interested
to
try
this
beer
and
wasnt
surprised
to
discover
it
was
miller
after
id
had
it
poured
for
me
for
the
masses
into
bland
weak
and
watery
beers
this
works
if
ciders
too
much
o
redds
apple
ale
barely
passes
for
a
beer
with
apple
flavor
as
opposed
to
a
cider
with
a
splash
of
malt
which
it
basically
is
new
to
the
scene
this
ale
drinks
like
a
lager
and
hops
on
the
trend
wagon
of
ciders
but
without
a
memorable
unique
product
all
thats
left
are
their
ads
and
i
have
a
feeling
people
will
move
on
thats
not
to
say
its
a
bad
product
redds
apple
ale
is
just
forgettable
taste
is
very
cidery
but
less
sweet
than
most
and
a
slightly
more
beerlike
finish
not
horrible
to
the
taste
but
i
wonder
about
all
the
seemingly
artificial
ingredients
and
still
question
how
this
qualifies
as
ale
goin
for
my
third
apple
ale
the
second
with
the
focus
being
more
on
the
apples
than
the
malts
ostensibly
i
mean
who
know
how
far
they
went
with
flavoring
like
ive
said

i
am
not
a
fan
beer
in
general
but
if
i
had
to
pick
one
this
one
would
win
hands
down
every
time
it
is
sweet
and
delicious
it
has
a
brilliant
red
color
with
a
vibrant
sweet
aroma
of
raspberry
when
tasting
this
it
is
soft
sweet
and
a
hint
of
tartness
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
not
overwhelming
in
any
sense
tastes
like
raspberry
soda
too
sweet
not
really
beer
phenomenal
raspberry
flavor
sweet
and
tart
at
the

time
way
too
sweet
and
at
this
price
i
will
try
and
mix
my
last
two
with
a
stout
just
not
for
me
reminded
me
of
a
table
wine
some
people
might
love
this
but
its
just
too
sweet
for
me
this
beer
is
incredibly
to
sweet
i
wasnt
even
able
to
finish
it
to
sweet
and
sugary
for
a
beer
stop
making

bottle

into

raspberry
jam
pretty
one

pretty
delicious
it
is
what
it
is
not
really
for
me
too
tart
sweet
for
the
style
its
good
fresh
fruit
flavor
ect
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
beer
would
go
well
with
dessert
pours
a
dark
red
with
almost
pink
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
raspberry
to
the
point
where
i
couldnt
make
out
anything
else
the
taste
was
rather
pleasant
but
very
sweet
but
the
aftertaste
lingered
way
too
long
with
a
mouthfeel
that
was
a
bit
syrupy
a
great
dessert
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time

for
me
solid

forward
ale
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
an
interesting
dessert
beer
i
bet
this
would
mix
well
with
a
sweet
wine
overall
i
tried
to
like
this
really
i
did
ive
read
good
things
about
it
and
founders
in
general
so
was
immensely
disappointed
with
the
overpowering
raspberryness
of
it
somehow
it
comes
out
tasting
rather
artifical
although
in
the
interests
of
full
disclosure
i
prefer
kriekstyle
beers
anyway
sadly
in
the
uk
at
least
a
proper
belgian
frambozen
is
easier
to
track
down
and
ultimately
better
tasting
too
disappointing
to
sweet
and
thick
taste
like
addes
syrup
overall
it
is
what
it
is
very
sweet
almost
too
sweet
i
like
it
but
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
malt
presence
to
balance
out
the
berryness
jammy
as
fuq
so
good
this
is
wonderfully
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
brew
i
think
it
would
go
down
really
well
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
just
way
too
sweet
and
syrupy
lacking
balance
in
flavor
and
body
very
good
lots
of
raspberries
so
kinda
of
tart
but
founders
did
a
very
nice
job
with
this
at
my
local
barbottle
shop
we
keep
this
on
tap
almost
all
summerfall
and
its
a
great
go
to
on
a
hot
day
or
just
a
nice
day
in
general
as
refreshing
as
a
beer
can
get
this
and
steigl
radler
are
two
beers
to
have
around
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
sweet
and
fruity

me
of

i
would

repeat
it
at
some
point
though
i
doubt
this
would
ever
become
a
regular
beer
for
me
i
did
enjoy
this
brew
even
though
it
was
a
bit
strong
on
the
fruity
side
but
hey
that
is
what
you
should
expect
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
goes
down
very
easy
a
good
summertime
beer
overall
this
is
a
raspberry
beer
that
well
tastes
like
rapsberries
i
cant
complain
about
it
but
it
is
a
touch
sweet
for
me
and
i
would
like
some
more
tartness
after
reading
a
few
reviews
here
it
seems
that
i
may
have
gotten
a
bottle
from
the
bad
batch
however
i
stick
by
my
rating
as
this
inconsistency
seems
common
enough
id
hesitantly
be
willing
to
give
this
another
go
poured
a
clear
ruby
red
body
with
a
thin
ring

a
good
looking
fruit
beer
very
bright
and
inviting
scents
of
sweet
and
slightly
tart
raspberries
raspberry
tart
and
indeterminate
red
berry
flavors
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
very
fruity
raspberry
dominated
profile
that
is
pleasant
but
a
bit
one
note
still
very
nice
for
a
fruity
beer
flavor
begins
very
sweet
with
strong
notes
of
sweet
raspberries
and
lesser
though
still
moderate
flavors
of
strawberries
and
blackberries
a
slight
sweet
malt
is
in
the
background
these
flavors
continue
into
the
middle
finish
is
sweet
with
the
same
flavors
on
display
with
a
bit
of
an
apple
flavor
also
present
and
a
slight
acidity
aftertaste
is
raspberries
blackberries
strawberries
and
sweet
and
grainy
malt
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
sweet
and
very
fruity
beer
those
flavors
dominate
and
make
this
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
one
note
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
slightly
tart
and
juicy
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
it
is
light
fruity
and
very
refreshing
with
a
wonderfully
pleasant
aroma
and
nicely
sweet
flavor
profile
this
is
further
enhanced
by
the
mouthfeel
it
is
a
bit
one
note
like
many
fruit
beers
but
it
is
still
good
for
the
style
tastes

yum
sometimes
i
can
find
this
on
draft
at
a
dive
bar
thats
always
a
good
night
its
tart
and
sweet
and
tastes
like
real
fruit
unlike
most
others
i
dont
even
mind
fulfilling
the
girl
drinker
stereotype
with
a
big

is
tinned
raspberries
and
flavour
is

nice
and
zesty
on
the
mouth

overall
just
a
bit
too
sweet
to
cut
it

from
warehouse
package
pours
ruby
red
with
no
head
aroma
of
raspberries
and
a
tartness
tastes
of
sweet

very
drinkable
and
delicious
like
an
alcoholic

juice
pours
a
clear
ruby
red
with
a
medium
slightly
pink
tinged
head
with
good
lacing
aroma
of

fill
the
senses

some

on
the
end
this
brew
seems

sweet

a
good
and
refreshing
summertime

at
the
kbs
release
out
of
all
the
beers
we
tried
that
night
this
was
my
least
favorite
but
it
was
still
good
light
ruby
colored
body
taste
of
sour
cranberries
with
some
malt
characters
i
may
have
rated
this
higher
but
living
in
wisconsin
and
having
access
to
new
glarus
and
there
tart
beers
have
really
made
all
others
tough
to
compare
still
pretty
good
a
well
balanced
refreshing
summer
beer
overall
an
excellent
summer
beer
wish
it
was
a
little
cheaper
but
im
sure
it
is
expensive
to
brew
so
im
just
glad
it
is
made
at
all
considering
buying
a
case
best
raspberry
beer
ive
ever
had
it
was
also
available
in
nitro
at
the
brewery
goes
great
with
founders
oatmeal
stout
overall
well
if
you
like
raspberry
jam
and
i
do
this
might
be
for
you
serve
as
a
dessert
or
digestif
pours
out
a
hazy
ruddy
red
head
is
slightly
offwhite
to
pink
nose
is
raspberry
candy
flavor
is
raspberry
raspberry
raspberry
thats
about
it
pretty
sweet
overall
the
fruit
contributes
some
tartness
but
it
isnt
enough
to
balance
the
sweet
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
i
love
raspberries
but
this
is
a
bit
much
to
finish
a
12
oz
i
would
like
this
in
a
4
oz
serving
as
a
digestif
much
better
o
i
found
the
first
few
sips
to
be
refreshing
but
the
raspberry
juice
like
qualities
make
this
a
sipper
an
enjoyable
freshtasting
fruit
beer
the
smell
was
by
far
the
most
enjoyable
and
balanced
part
of
the
this
beer
overall
not
exactly
my
test
but
i
can
see
why
people
like
it
overall
im
not
very
impressed
by
this
beer
its
like
a
moderately
better
version
of
a
standard
raspberryflavored
malt
beverage
dont
misunderstand
me
its
far
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
than
those
abominations
but
its
nothing
amazing
also
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
anyway
i
would
have
much
rather
enjoyed
a
raspberry
sour
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
you
crave
the
raspberry
flavor
o
drinkability
is
high
on
the
charts
as
the
lower
abv
content
makes
for
a
nice
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
not
overly
sweet
but
not
puckering
with
tartness
a
nice
blend
of
fruity
aroma
and
flavors
with
just
enough
of
a
maltwheat
presence
to
create
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
for
all
occasions
for
a
style
of
beer
that
is
consistently
maligned
founders
has
concocted
quite
the
pleasant
surprise
with
this
raspberryinfused
beer
would
recommend
for
anyone
who
enjoys
wheat
beers
or
lambics
in
my
mind
this
seems
to
cut
a
middle
ground
between
the
two
tastetart
raspberry
malt
sweetness
a
bit
undercarbonated
refreshing
and
pleasant
though
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
oa
nice
flavorful
fruit
beer
that
isnt
sickly
sweet
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
definitely
worth
trying
recommended
vintage
try
one
aged
drink
three
fresh
love
me
some
founders
took
awhile
however
to
give
this
a
whirl
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
snifter
next
to
zero
head
though
a
unique
deep
ruby
hue
that
demanded
a
longer
look
than
i
give
most
brews
aroma
of
clear
raspberry
i
hope
right
light
citrus
and
a
hint
of
malty
goodness
not
as
much
actual
raspberry
to
the
taste
quite
subtle
really
a
nice
refreshing
tart
aftertaste
light
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
in
the
mouth
was
thinking
that
it
might
be
too
syrupy
sweet
and
pleased
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
again
even
though
it
was
good
not
really
my
thing
but
was
happy
for
the
experience
delicate
touch
to
a
beer
that
could
have
been
a
raspberry
nightmare
great
beer
bottle
was
dated
04042014
freshtasting
with
full
bodied
raspberry
flavor
no
buzz
with
just
one
left
me
happy
to
have
tried
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
put
it
up
against
the
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
but
it
stands
pretty
well
on
its
own
nice
balance
of
sweetnesstart
and
its
obvious
it
uses
fresh
natural
raspberries
what
else
should
one
expect
from
a
fruit
beer
founders
went
all
in
on
fruit
flavoring
with
this
one
so
like
most
fruit
beers
and
lambics
that
stress
the
fruit
this
is
probably
a
loveitorhateit
brew
for
my
money
this
is
the
right
way
to
do
a
fruit
beer
i
want
to
taste
the
fruit
if
i
choose
a
fruit
beer
and
i
want
it
to
taste
like
real
fruit
not
artificial
this
one
pretty
much
hits
the
spot
is
fairly
thirstquenching
and
manages
to
still
feel
somewhat
like
a
beer
all
things
considered
if
that
sounds
like
your
cup
of
tea
er
beer
then
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
youll
find
o
nice
summer
refreshing
fruit
beer
but
could
probably
only
have
one
as
it
is
overly
sweet
and
very
one
note
overall
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
im
gonna
compare
this
one
to
new
glarus
offerings
which
is
probably
unfair
but
it
is
too
one
dimensional
to
compete
with
theirs
this
beer
does
with
it
sets
out
to
do
and
i
will
give
it
that
but
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
a
little
more
complexity
overall
just
like
all
great
beer
its
meant
to
be
enjoyed
one
or
two
per
sitting
i
had
this
next
to
samuel
smiths
cherry
beer
and
even
the
taste
was
lacking
so
its
true
you
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
recommended
edit
revisiting
this
makes
me
realize
how
good
it
is
dryer
than
i
gave
it
credit
fore
before
and
really
authentic
on
the
fruit
front
maybe
freshness
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
differences
but
i
am
bumping
up
a
few
scores
to
reflect
how
much
i
am
digging
this
one
right
now
very
solid
offering
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
few
sips
o
a
great
beer
just
wish
it
was
not
so
expensive
or
this
one
would
be
a
regular
poured
from
a
bottle
into
12
oz
tulip
nothing
resembling
a
head
here
slightest
trace
of
lacing
doesnt
last
too
long
raspberries
come
off
strong
immediately
in
the
aroma
and
hide
anything
else
that
might
be
there
taste
is
the
same
thing
for
me
the
taste
is
delicious
but
i
really
feel
like
im
drinking
raspberry
juice
i
havent
had
a
lot
in
this
style
so
im
not
sure
exactly
what
to
look
for
in
terms
of
depth
and
complexity
incredibly
refreshing
however
cheers
o
founders
rarely
seems
to
go
wrong
and
rubaeus
is
no
exception
its
extremely
balanced
and
well
made
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
flavored
beers
but
i
tasted
this
one
a
second
time
and
it
was
much
better
than
a
year
ago
nice
raspberry
color
flavor
and
aroma
it
is
something
like
raspberry
soda
but
with
less
but
ample
carbonation
and
the
flavor
of
raspberry
is
prominent
yet
not
overwhelming
great
mouth
feel
for
this
type
of
beer
i
could
drink
this
on
a
nice
tropical
day
and
not
get
sick
of
it
well
maybe
after
4
of
them
but
i
have
a
hard
time
drinking
4
of
any
of
the
same
beer
in
one
sitting
i
like
to
mix
it
up
if
you
like
an
ale
with
a
hint
of
fruit
this
is
a
goto
tastes
like
real
raspberries
not
the
chemicalmedicinalcandy
flavor
in
a
lot
of
the
fruit
ales
sweet
but
not
overly
so
very
smooth
beautiful
color
excellent
all
around
as
a
summer
refresher
a
fairly
good
fruit
beer
certainly
up
there
with
the
best
that
ive
tried
easy
to
drink
it
went
down
well
with
some
nice
malts
bitterness
helping
level
out
the
sweetness
from
the
raspberries
an
enjoyable
one
but
youd
be
hard
pushed
to
drink
more
than
one
of
them
in
a
sitting
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
not
only
for
its
uniqueness
but
also
because
its
really
good
pours
a
hazy
reddish
color
with
hints
of
orange
and
brown
head
doesnt
last
long
nose
has
fruity
sour
notes
and
the
obvious
fruits
of
course
delightfully
sour
on
the
palate
sweet
fruity
refreshing
manages
to
be
huge
on
flavor
without
being
sickly
sweet
or
too
sour
glad
i
tried
this
one
and
set
aside
the
usual
stereotypes
about
this
sort
of
thing
being
for
the
girls
mf
good
carbonation
leading
to
a
bite
on
the
palate

i
will
try

glass
my
preferred
all

beer
tasting
glass
tasted

i
would
like
to
taste
it
a
bolder
version
tuning
up
other
than
raspberries
notes
or
unbalancing
it
a
bit
onot
bad
definitely
worth
trying
once
or
twice
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
seek
it
out
all
the
time
o
i
will
seek
this
out
in
the
future
i
purchased
one
bottle
as
part
of
a
mixnmatch
six
pack
the
other
day
and
am
sorry
i
didnt
purchase
more
this
is
a
perfect
summerearly
autumn
ale
choice
and
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
a
cheese
plate
or
a
dessert
of
chocolate
mousse
or
cake
or
a
creme
brulee
suffice
to
say
i
really
love
this
ale
m
one
and
done
for
me
much
too
sweet
not
much
alcohol
present
just
too
much
fruit
and
not
enough
beer
qualities
its
kinda
gross
really
i
have
no
idea
who
this
beer
is
targeted
towards
its
a
lousy
beer
and
a
lousy
wine
cooler
if
you
enjoy
drinking
dish
detergent
then
this
may
be
the
beer
for
you
otherwise
move
on
worst
founders
beer
ive
ever
had
probably
in
the
top
5
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
i
like
sweeter
beers
this
was
very
good
would
revisit
on
a
summer
day
o
first
time
trying
a
fruit
beer
from
founders
a
very
nice
raspberry
fruit
beer
unfortunately
i
have
been
spoiled
by
knowing
what
a
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
tastes
like
so
most
everything
else
will
pail
in
comparison
overall
although
this
a
pretty
onedimensional
beer
it
tastes
great
and
has
tons
of
raspberries
in
here
this
is
a
raspberry
bomb
that
i
am
very
happy
they
decided
to
brew
this
again
as
it
was
harder
to
get
last
year
i
was
really
excited
to
hear
it
was
being
released
again
and
will
definitely
be
buying
lots
of
these
4packs
that
being
said
the
onedimensional
taste
and
the
tiny
head
thats
disappears
right
away
take
a
little
from
this
beer
o
well
its
pretty
much
pure
raspberry
alcoholic
raspberry
soda
the
only
way
you
can
tell
its
not
soda
is
the
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
really
tasty
crisp
and
refreshing
great
warm
weather
beer
its
not
the
most
complex
and
a
it
loses
a
lot
of
typical
beer
characteristics
but
i
dont
think
thats
the
point
here
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
probably
the
best
raspberry
flavor
in
a
beer
short
of
ng
raspberry
tart
cheers
o
an
enjoyable
raspberry
ale
very
happy
i
was
able
to
try
this
really
hope
founders
comes
to
maryland
soon
so
next
i
can
pick
this
up
a
little
closer
to
home
overall
this
is
only
a
mediocre
showing
from
founders
but
a
must
try
for
anyone
with
a
palate
for
fruity
brews
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
and
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
fruity
beers
like
this
i
know
a
ton
of
people
that
absolutely
love
this
beer
though
for
me
i
think
it
is
too
sweet
to
really
enjoy
with
any
sort
of
food
i
do
enjoy
this
on
occasion
but
it
tends
to
upset
my
stomach
pours
an
attractive
red
shade
somewhere
in
between
burgundy
and
cardinal
a
soft
pink
covering
of
foam
rests
nicely
on
top
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
complex
while
a
trace
of
hops
and
grains
can
be
detected
the
drinker
is
overwhelmed
with
ripe
raspberry
a
tart
aspect
mixes
well
with
what
is
perceived
to
be
the
malts
the
flavor
is
quite
similar
to
the
qualities
in
the
aroma
it
is
a
bit
earthy
a
little
bitter
and
is
very
winelike
its
got
a
nice
crisp
finish
similar
to
a
fresh
cider
overall
i
rather
like
this
one
especially
as
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
fruit
beers
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
adult
beverages
except
perhaps
those
who
might
not
like
something
thats
moderately
tart
overall
i
would
recommend
this
for
late
springlate
summerfall
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
outside
in
the
shade
on
a
moderately
warm
day
cheers
to
illudium
for
the
sample
overall
not
overly
sweet
which
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
raspberry
beginning
middle
and
end
nice
lambiclike
beer
overall
a
tasty
fruit
beer
very
strong
raspberry
aroma
pours
deep
ruby
brown
with
red
highlights
pale
off
whitepink
head
head
dissipates
immediately
taste
is
sweet
raspberry
absolutely
forward
lambic
like
very
drinkable
not
for
the
person
who
loves
hops
oi
dont
really
care
for
this
i
love
fruit
beers
but
this
is
just
so
thick
and
syrupy
its
made
for
nightmare
hangovers
its
not
even
dry
drinkable
it
just
reminds
me
of
a
stronger
macro
fruit
beer
o
i
enjoy
fruit
beers
and
this
one
offers
many
of
the
things
i
enjoy
most
without
being
too
sweet
or
too
tart
delivers
nearly
6
abv
with
barely
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
involved
held
together
surprisingly
well
even
though
we
are
several
months
past
the
beers
release
season
very
happy
to
try
this
and
will
seek
it
out
again
next
summer
overallcomments
rubaeus
is
another
in
a
long
line
of
excellent
beers
produced
by
founders
rubaeus
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
maybe
could
have
used
a
bit
of
bitterness
for
balance
i
really
would
like
to
try
this
mixed
with
a
nice
stout
or
porter
i
recommend
trying
out
rubaeus

you
have

a
very
juicy
and
nice
fruit
beer
raspberry
being
my
favorite
helps
alot
the
balance
between
the
natural
tartness
of
the
fruit
and
sweetness
is
clinging
on
the
edge
of
being
too
sweet
but
it
works
overall
this
is
very
different
from
a
lambic
or
a
sour
beer
its
heavy
for
something
so
fruity
in
a
good
way
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
one
or
two
once
in
awhile
would
be
pretty
good
i
would
buy
this
again
to
have
around
for
a
nice
changeup
o
didnt
know
what
to
expect
as
ive
never
had
a
fruit
beer
other
than
shiners
prickly
pear
this
was
overall
a
good
one
i
like
the
taste
and
the
mouth
although
they
arent
necessarily
fantastic
founders
never
disappoints
me

a
beautiful
dark
ruby
pour
with
little
head
or
lacing
the
nose
is
of
raspberry
overlaying
a
sweet
backbone
almost
medium
bodied
with
a
carbonation
level
set
to
provide
crispness
and
a
flavor
explosion
the
smooth
mouthfeel
translates
to
an
expertly
well
balanced
raspberry
tart
and
sweet
flavor
profile
raspberry
predominates
then
the
tartness
hits
the
palate
and
ends
on
a
sweet
note
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
lingering
tartness
after
the
raspberry
and
sweetness
fades
another
masterpiece
from
founders
o
very
sweet
and
fruity
a
bit
syrupy
ok
o
nice
to
take
a
couple
sips
of
but
i
probably
couldnt
finish
an
entire
glass
of
this
being
a
big
raspberry
fan
i
bought
a
four
pack
of
these
and
already
tried
it
and
not
liked
it
but
thought
id
review
it
anyway
and
not
suprisingly
its
a
raspberry
hue
with
a
one
finger
head
and
some
nice
lacingthe
smell
is
raspberry
lollies
thats
itthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
and
on
taste
i
have
to
make
sure
im
not
drinking
cool
drink
its
basically
a
big
sweet
mess
of
raspberries
everything
else
has
no
chance
of
getting
through
the
only
taste
i
get
is
raspberry
jam
and
raspberry
lollies
and
overall
if
you
like
lollies
and
sweet
stuff
then
sure
try
it
but
ill
never
drink
this
one
again
cheers
much
too
sweet
nothing
apparent
behind
the
raspberry
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
one
i
would
search
out
again
i
prefer
sour
fruit
beers
over
this
and
if
i
want
to
drink
a
raspberry
beer
ill
go
for
a
raspberry
lambic
this
was
not
my
favorite
founders
brew
but
it
was
not
a
bad
offering
i
didnt
think
that
it
separated
itself
from
the
pack
and
would
have
preferred
it
stayed
sweeter
throughout
because
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
didnt
quite
meld
with
the
initial
fruity
sweetness
as
an
admitted
founders
fanboy
i
must
confess
this
brew
is
something
of
a
disappointment
considering
their
track
record
its
not
bad
but
it
feels
like
a
novelty
compared
to
founders
usual
standard
of
quality
if
youre
looking
for
a
class
fruitinfused
beer
youre
better
off
sticking
to
lindemans
i
enjoyed
my
small
sample
and
certainly
can
appreciate
the
craft
that
went
into
making
this
offering
but
it
tasted
more
like
a
mixed
drink
to
me
than
a
beer
as
i
was
drinking
this
i
actually
thought
that
i
finally
found
a
beer
that
my
wife
who
hates
beer
would
enjoy
total
3450
o
overall
i
am
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
loves
raspberries
if
you
love
raspberries
you
will
love
this
beer
if
you
dislike
raspberries
you
will
dislike
this
beer
highly
recommended
o
i
say
it
is
poor
overall
if
i
am
looking
for
a
raspberry
flavor
like
this
i
will
go
for
a
lambic
over
this
any
day
this
is
similar
to
the
wild
red
beer
from
ab
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
id
defiantly
recommend
if
youre
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
overall
i
really
like
this
and
could
easily
drink
a
dangerous
amount
of
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
add
this
to
my
list
of
summer
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beverage
good
raspberry
flavor
with
a
great
balance
between
the
sweet
and
the
tart
but
unfortunately
not
too
much
beer
flavor
its
more
like
a
lowalcohol
punch
that
being
said
itd
be
a
great
brunch
drink
once
in
a
while
beer
for
me
but
it
is
well
executed
and
pretty
darn
tasty
overall
if
you
like
raspberries
then
youll
like
this
good
beer
it
just
needs
a
little
more
carbonation
o
rubaeus
is
a
decent
beer
very
sessionable
and
a
nice
substitute
for
more
expensive
sours
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
probably
the
best
raspberry
ale
ive
ever
had
the
opportunity
to
try
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
was
a
fantastic
raspberry
ale
the
scent
and
taste
were
delicious
the
body
was
ok
but
the
finish
was
really
smooth
so
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
better
than
raspberry
tart
impressive
dessert
beer
a
fruit
beer
is
what
a
fruit
beer
isbarely
beer
like
some
not
even
drinkable
this
is
drinkable
but
only
slightly
beer
like
its
well
above
average
for
a
fruit
beer
o
i
could
drink
this
all
day
or
summer
i
hope
founders
comes
to
md
by
next
summer
because
i
would
love
to
have
better
access
to
this
o
really
pleasant
not
quite
as
earth
shattering
as
blushing
monk
but
a
darn
good
substitute
in
12s
and
4
packs
good
stuff
o
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
normally
go
for
fruit
beers
that
is
but
once
again
founders
proves
that
they
can
make
anything
awesome
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
o
not
sure
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
but
this
is
quite
tasty
could
definitely
also
have
some
great
uses
in
the
kitchen
when
cooking
in
place
of
chambord
i
think
they
have
obviously
tweaked
this
one
since
i
last
had
it
in
2008
i
remember
it
being
an
orangish
color
and
only
tasting
faintly
of
actual
raspberry
well
now
it
is
much
darker
and
actually
dark
red
in
color
and
it
actually
tastes
like
an
explosion
of
raspberries
the
aroma
is
nice
but
slightly
faint
all
raspberry
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
only
it
is
stronger
great
beer
and
ill
be
picking
up
a
full
4
pack
next
time
im
at
the
store
had
this
on
draft
at
proof
great
rosy
red
color
aroma
of
sweet
berries
some
dry
straw
a
faint
bready
presence
and
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
as
well
taste
is
mostly
the
berry
but
i
also
got
some
of
the
hops
and
dry
biscuit
along
with
the
berry
in
the
finish
i
will
definitely
drink
more
of
this
as
the
summer
winds
down
o
just
as
advertised
huge
raspberry
flavor
a
very
fruity
beer
but
does
what
it
tries
to
do
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
had
all
raspberries
suppose
it
could
do
for
some
more
complexity
but
its
too
delicious
to
complain
thought
this
was
vastly
superior
to
cerise
because
this
beer
is
all
fruit
is
seems
like
a
perfect
mixing
beer
in
fact
i
just
mixed
some
in
a
breakfast
stout
and
it
is
fantastic
o
this
was
what
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
something
different
but
not
overly
sugary
and
fruity
and
this
was
just
that
although
expensive
i
feel
the
uniqueness
will
justify
it
a
bit
of
a
good
mess
aroma
does
not
even
close
to
match
flavors
recommended
but
not
anything
overwhelming
may
need
time
to
sit
and
think
o
there
is
no
mistaking
this
is
a
great
fruit
beer
are
there
better
ones
yes
but
this
is
really
good
this
is
like
blushing
monks
younger
brother
pours
a
clear
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
raspberries
and
raspberry
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
lots
of
raspberry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
seedlike
earthy
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
raspberry
presence
but
nothing
too
memorable
for
a
fruit
beer
in
my
opinion
very
nice
fruit
beer
i
like
this
quite
a
lot
would
most
certainly
drink
this
again
mouthfeel
is
light
with
light
carbonation
a
tart
and
almost
bitter
finish
that
trails
off
sweet
and
fruity
overall
its
a
combo
of
raspberry
and
grains
this
was
good
as
a
fruity
beer
but
not
a
session
brew
for
me
and
one
im
glad
i
tried
as
it
was
good
but
i
may
not
seek
it
out
good
for
the
style
this
one
just
goes
way
to
far
to
the
sweet
side
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
will
probably
see
much
of
the
variety
in
its
ratings
due
to
the
age
old
struggle
of
personal
taste
vs
stylistic
integrity
its
definitely
not
for
everyone
or
for
every
occasion
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
done
quite
well
not
that
i
would
expect
any
less
from
founders
at
this
point
its
easily
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
find
myself
reaching
for
it
ahead
of
other
items
available
that
often
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
but
i
wont
pine
for
her
when
shes
gone
overall
a
rather
tasty
fruit
beer
with
a
decent
sour
characteristics
it
is
very
much
like
a
more
affordable
slightly
less
tart
lindemans
framboise
overall
quite
tasty
o
i
think
i
preferred
cerise
to
this
one
ive
been
looking
to
try
this
for
a
while
now
so
in
that
regard
this
is
a
mild
letdown
of
course
this
beers
monotony
means
i
dont
have
to
write
a
long
review
wooo
overall
like
its
new
glarus
brethren
its
mostly
juice
i
think
id
take
the
lighter
versions
over
this
though
this
beer
looks
and
smells
outstanding
and
although
its
certainly
well
made
its
a
bit
overdone
in
the
fruitiness
the
raspberry
flavors
are
just
a
bit
too
sweet
im
glad
i
tried
this
because
it
seems
to
have
some
qualities
that
make
it
stand
out
as
different
from
many
others
but
i
found
it
just
a
bit
too
much
o
a
very
delicious
raspberry
beer
definitely
sweet
borderline
syrupy
but
the
fruit
has
a
natural
nonsynthetic
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
definitely
worth
seeking
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
thanks
you
kevin
tastes
like
the
raspberry
syrup
in
the
syrup
carousel
at
ihop
diabeetus
possibly
its
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
but
neither
is
it
unappealing
id
have
to
say
it
is
a
good
fruit
beer
but
i
am
more
curious
to
see
how
this
can
compliment
another
beer
in
a
blend
than
drink
my
remaining
2
by
themselves
high
c
not
sure
we
will
buy
it
again
but
if
we
do
we
will
defiantly
let
it
breath
a
few
hours
because
it
really
improved
the
bottle
we
had
o
i
wasnt
revolted
by
this
but
i
wont
rush
out
to
buy
more
it
is
much
closer
to
a
raspberry
flavored
malt
liquor
drink
than
what
i
would
call
beer
i
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
it
took
to
get
all
that
flavor
in
without
using
the
artificial
flavoring
rout
but
it
isnt
to
my
taste
overall
is
it
a
beer
factually
yes
otherwise
id
call
it
a
shot
at
a
standard
malt
beverage
from
founders
i
would
probably
rate
this
higher
if
i
had
never
had
any
new
glarus
fruit
beers
regardless
this
may
be
the
best
fruit
beer
that
i
can
buy
without
going
to
wisconsin
it
loses
some
charm
as
it
warms
up
but
its
still
good
and
unlike
most
fruit
beers
i
would
actually
buy
this
again
refreshing
and
lightmedium
bodied
sweet
and
slightly
sticky
an
okay
fruit
beer
and
much
better
than
most
other
fruit
beers
that
ive
had
not
quite
on
the
level
of
raspberry
tart
but
i
think
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
just
right
compared
to
that
raspberry
tart
rt
is
thicker
with
a
better
nose
and
appearance
but
the
sweetness
on
that
beer
is
just
off
rubaeus
does
it
quite
well
but
is
lacking
in
a
lot
of
departments
still
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
but
im
definitely
not
stockpiling
these
overall
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
from
founders
decent
flavor
but
too
sweet
to
really
enjoy
taste
is
rich
and
very
very
raspberry
i
get
a
trickle
of
sour
but
plenty
of
sweet
to
round
it
all
up
a
welltasty
and
enjoyable
fruit
ale
though
definitely
not
a
favorite
from
this
brewerys
outstanding
canon
considering
how
long
cerise
malingered
the
past
few
years
how
can
this
one
be
put
behind
the
counter
whatever
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
ruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
bone
foam
the
nose
is
a
simple
wave
of
slightlydank
fresh
raspberries
the
taste
echoes
this
simple
sentiment
the
berries
coming
through
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
so
much
as
to
trigger
a
diabetic
reaction
or
anything
moreover
things
taste
pretty
damn
natural
not
very
medicinal
or
artificial
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
very
tasty
and
highly
enjoyable
fruit
beer
no
wonder
this
one
is
behind
the
counter
the
pink
color
was
unlike
most
other
beers
but
obviously
the
raspberries
were
responsible
for
this
hue
the
head
was
fizzy
and
one
finger
thick
at
most
the
beer
looked
more
like
a
rosé
wine
except
with
carbonation
the
smell
also
was
clearly
indicative
of
the
fruit
used
in
making
the
beer
with
strong
raspberry
scent
dominating
all
else
taste
was
dominated
by
tartsweet
raspberries
some
malt
sweetness
and
showed
no
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
simple
this
is
clearly
a
fruit
dominated
drink
and
barely
a
beer
at
all
but
it
was
good
on
its
own
terms
o
good
but
not
great
the
flavors
come
off
as
slightly
artificial
and
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
its
entirely
one
dimensional
but
still
enjoyable
a
good
summer
beer
and
if
you
like
raspberries
its
certain
youll
like
this
final
thoughts
yet
another
interesting
if
not
quite
solid
beer
from
founders
i
tend
to
think
beers
with
added
fruit
should
be
more
tart
like
a
lambic
but
not
a
bad
effort
here
definitely
one
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
would
i
drink
it
again
i
suppose

ill
definitely

for
it

perfect

excellent

for

the
only
downside
on
this
beer
is
that
i
find
myself
drinking
it
too
quickly
because
its
so
freaking
delicious
full
blast
of
raspberry
in
both

and

not

sweet

rubaeus
loses

contest

out
the

tasty

i
dont
typically
go
for
fruit

this
one
hits
the
mark
on
so
many
levels
not

on
the
nose
combined
with
semisweet
malt
opens
with
big
fresh
raspberry
combined
with
general
berry
jam
notes
smooth
malt
and
even
hints
of
vanilla
very
crisp
light
body
smooth
with
a
hint
of
syrup
and
stickiness
on
the
edges
rubaeus
succeeds
in
staying
very
balanced
and
is
never
overly
sweet
one
of
the
most
common
failings
among
some
fruit
beers
definitely
a
winner
overall
this
is
a
really
great
fruit
beer
love
the
smell
and
taste
if
i
was
looking
to
get
fruit
beer
again
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
if
it
was
in
season
pours
a
deep
but
vibrant
crimson
head
has
a
slightly
pink
tinge
to
it
full
on
raspberry
onslaught
nothing
artificial
about
it
just
pure
raspberry
like
homemade
raspberry
jam
theres
a
definite
sugar
cookie
malt
sweetness
going
on
underneath
which
further
enhances
the
fruit
but
other
than
that
its
all
raspberry
a
slight
natural
tartness
lingers
on
the
finish
just
a
step
behind
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
in
terms
of
fruit
intensity
there
arent
many
clean
fruit
beers
i
enjoy
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
them
that
said
its
not
a
beer
to
drink
in
quantity
but
as
a
nice
aperitif
or
as
something
fun
to
pair
with
sweets
overall
if
you
love
raspberries
this
is
the
beer
for
you
itsonedimensional
but
it
nails
that
dimension
very
well
i
would
say
this
belongs
on
pancakes
if
i
wasnt
so
loyal
to
maple
syrup
this
is
very
sweet
so
a
little
goes
a
long
way
the
flavor
is
good
and
the
quality
high
this
might
just
not
be
for
me
a
relatively
weak
raspberry
beer
in
my
opinion
not
bad
but
i
just
find
it
dull
and
that
buttery
character
doesnt
blend
well
at
all
with
the
raspberry
lastly
the
raspberry
is
not
as
potent
as
it
is
in
the
best
fruit
beers
comes
nowhere
close
to
the
quality
of
new
glaruss
raspberry
tart
so
ill
stick
to
that
o
a
good
beer
that
was
a
touch
too
sweet
for
me
but
a
nice
night
cap
all
in
all
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
here
founders
does
a
good
job
of
not
overpowering
the
palate
there
is
a
complexity
here
that
reveals
itself
before
the
raspberry
hammer
falls
o
a
very
good
fruit
beer
light
refreshing
and
very
easy
drinking
maybe
a
bit
nm
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
overall
this
is
a
great
raspberry
beer
from
my
memory
i
think
it
is
less
sweet
than
the
ng
raspberry
tart
im
glad
this
comes
in
a
12
oz
and
im
glad
i
got
this
in
a
build
your
own
pack
satisfying
beer
but
this
style
isnt
one
i
go
far
too
often
o
i
read
the
hype
for
this
fruit
beer
and
was
skeptical
raspberry
has
been
my
least
liked
fruit
beer
so
far
this
beer
tastes
way
fresher
than
any
other
raspberry
beer
i
am
glad
the
cherry
crop
suffered
in
michigan
so
i
got
to
try
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
full
flavored
without
being
overpowering
or
cloying
it
has
depth
of
flavor
but
showcases
the
raspberries
perfectly
for
an
fruit
beer
fan
raspberry
fan
or
simply
someone
who
likes
a
well
crafted
beer
this
is
definitely
one
that
is
worth
checking
out
it
appears
that
founders
made
a
raspberry
jam
and
then
put
alcohol
into
it
and
made
it
a
beer
this
is
unique
and
refreshing
and
founders
nailed
what
they
were
going
for
this
is
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
reminds
me
of
the
new
glarus
beers
o
is
this
a
straightforward
fruit
beer
yes
and
no
the
raspberry
is
definitely
the
main
attraction
but
theres
enough
contrast
thrown
in
to
add
complexity
and
enhance
drinkability
fresh
and
authentic
fruit
flavor
is
the
driving
force
but
a
balancing
tartness
and
supporting
malt
base
make
this
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
on
the
market
i
dont
think
ive
ever
been
this
pleased
with
a
fruitforward
beer
that
wasnt
a
lambic
o
well
its
not
going
to
be
my
favorite
beer
but
its
really
pretty
good
for
a
nonsour
fruited
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
recommended
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
overall
its
not
cheap
and
its
not
kidding
when
it
says
it
is
a
pure
raspberry
ale
its
also
not
complex
and
its
also
not
something
that
everyone
will
like
but
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
and
ill
drink
it
again
its
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
just
because
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
thin
and
the
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
o
im
always
a
little
nervous
about
trying
fruit
beers
this
might
be
the
least
favorite
founders
beer
ive
had
to
date
but
its
definitely
an
above
average
fruit
beer
still
good
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
overall
rubaeus
is
a
successful
brew
that
is
for
sure
with
heaps
of
berry
flavor
from
5
different
stages
of
berry
additions
this
is
a
straight
forward
high
quality
fruit
beer
id
love
to
pair
this
with
my
grandmothers
chocolate
raspberry
cake
a
beginners
lambic
fresh
fruity
taste
with
slight
sour
notes
a
refreshing
fruit
beer
that
would
work
as
a
great
introduction
to
lambic
or
other
sour
beer
styles
o
not
for
me
but
i
can
see
how
some
would
appreciate
this
beer
overall
a
little
sweet
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
can
see
the
ladies
liking
it
solid
fruit
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
a
true
raspberry
beer
enjoy
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
that
i
wish
was
a
bit
more
subtle
but
i
can
see
why
some
would
love
it
kind
of
like
a
blushing
monk
light
not
bad
at
all
but
it
lacks
the
depth
ive
come
to
love
and
expect
from
founders
still
this
is
so
much
better
than
cerise
was
and
i
think
i
may
try
it
again
blended
with
their
imperial
stout
o
okay
i
love
belgian
sours
maybe
more
than
most
but
its
not
something
i
can
do
everyday
like
say
my
wife
could
but
this
thing
is
much
lmuch
more
than
just
a
fruit
beer
or
a
sour
it
has
some
balance
and
complexity
to
it
maybe
not
a
lot
but
the
founders
imprint
of
their
malt
style
this
thing
lets
you
know
you
are
indeed
drinking
a
brew
from
the
same
folks
who
make
the
worlds
best
stouts
this
is
perfect
for
summer
and
a
real
answer
to
the
somewhat
disappointing
cerise
and
i
liked
cerise
but
it
was
no
where
near
as
brilliant
as
this
thing
is
founders
may
have
indeed
found
the
direction
they
want
to
go
in
during
the
warm
months
of
summer
the
early
spring
in
2012
devastated
the
michigan
cherry
crop
and
founders
turned
to
raspberries
for
their
fruit
beer
overall
the
result
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
overall
theres
not
much
to
say
about
this
brew
it
tastes
like
raspberries
and
it
tastes
awesome
nothing
insanely
complex
just
delicious
raspberry
beer
nothing
wrong
with
that
and
i
look
forward
to
it
every
summer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
for
people
like
me
that
dont
ever
drink
them
ever
it
was
really
a
surprising
treat
o
thirst
quenching
sweet
and
tart
with
a
great
freshness
to
it
perfect
beer
to
blend
with
a
berliner
or
a
light
ipa
ill
have
to
try
this
soon
o
definately
not
your
everyday
beer
very
sweet
and
fruity
but
is
well
done
within
that
style
worth
mentioning
in
the
same
sentence
as
rasberry
tart
and
wisconsin
belgian
red
although
both
those
are
indeed
better
o
this
is
a
nice
fruit
beer
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
cerise
of
course
with
raspberries
instead
of
cherries
i
think
this
is
bettercrafted
than
cerise
with
a
stronger
base
beer
and
noticeably
fresh
fruit
being
used
rather
than
extracts
i
still
prefer
fruit
beers
that
are
mostly
beer
with
a
touch
of
fruit
rather
than
the
other
way
around
but
this
tasty
and
drinkable
one
will
do
nice
job
from
founders
o
this
is
a
topnotch
raspberry
brew
not
as
good
as
their
blushing
monk
but
a
solid
option
and
a
must
try
if
you
love
raspberry
overall
especially
due
to
the
price
of
this
offering
i
would
generally
dissuade
others
from
shelling
out
the
13
or
14
for
a
4pack
considering
the
low
alcohol
content
however
i
dont
regret
trying
it
at
all
and
if
someone
approached
me
asking
for
my
recommendations
for
fruity
beers
this
would
be
chief
among
them
very
well
done
for
the
style
but
not
a
beer
i
can
see
many
flocking
to
considering
the
pricetag
odecent
fruit
beer
but
too
sweet
for
me
wish
it
had
a
lot
more
tartness
its
simple
yeah
but
a
very
solid
straight
up
fruit
beer
nice
fresh
taste
light
and
drinkable
good
summer
release
pure
raspberry
ale
the
ulimate
pantydropper
tastes
like
juice
so
many
brewries
use
fruit
extracts
and
other
flavorings
you
can
tell
lots
of
real
raspberries
are
used
in
this
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
overall
an
enjoyable
raspberry
beer
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
bottle
however
because
it
is
kind
of
sweet
like
behati
prinsloo
holding
a
raspberry
raul
wouldnt
mind
taking
another
bite
roar
pours
a
clear
dark
red
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offpink
color
slight
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sugar
raspberry
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
grass
fits
the
style
of
an
fruit
vegetable
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sugar
raspberry
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
grass
overall
too
sweet
and
lacking
sharpness
but
otherwise
a
good
beer
o
this
beer
tastes
as
if
the
brewer
fermented
all
of
the
sweetness
of
a
ng
razz
tart
now
i
can
appreciate
that
this
beer
isnt
supposed
to
be
a
razz
tart
knockoff
but
in
the
end
razz
tart
is
the
better
beer
by
far
this
beer
offers
up
a
nice
raspberry
flavor
and
a
nice
light
tartness
but
it
is
also
rather
unidimensional
and
unexciting
m
too
sweet
to
be
refreshing
mediumbodied
i
was
expecting
a
hot
summer
day
refresher
but
what
i
got
was
dessert
beer
this
is
tasty
but
its
so
sweet
and
raspberry
that
its
overwhelming
it
could
be
better
balanced
good
take
on
the
raspberry
ale
with
enough
tartness
to
make
things
interesting
not
an
everyday
brew
by
any
means
but
still
quite
enjoyable
o
it
is
what
it
says
its
going
to
be
just
a
burst
of
great
slightly
sour
sweet
raspberry
flavor
not
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
an
amazing
brewery
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
world
of
ipas
stouts
etc
overall
very
good
for
a
fruit
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
for
the
style
a
nice
fruit
beer
with
a
big
emphasis
on
fruit
and
less
emphasis
on
beer
otoo
sweet
and
very
one
dimensional
still
an
upgrade
from
cerise
but
too
sweet
for
me
overall
hits
a
sweet
spot
in
the
summer
time
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
raspberries
so
this
one
is
a
no
brainer
certainly
can
be
like
by
most
people
o
a
most
unusual
beer
rubaeus
certainly
delivers
the
raspberry
flavor
however
at
the
price
point
it
might
be
possible
to
get
just
as
much
fruiity
flavor
with
more
than
twice
the
abv
from
a
bottle
of
wild
vines
or
arbor
mist
id
recommend
this
only
if
you
love
the
flavor
of
unsweetened
semiripe
raspberries
and
dont
really
want
to
get
a
big
buzz
o
good
beer
but
very
sweet
and
probably
only
up
for
one
pours
deep
pink
in
color
leaving
a
moderately
sized
head
which
quickly
calms
down
to
a
film
looks
very
carbonated
smell
is
of
raspberries
and
a
mild
alcohol
background
a
bit
tart
with
a
punch
that
leaves
a
sweet
and
tart
aftertaste
but
is
balanced
very
very
well
carbonation
is
much
less
than
it
appears
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
becoming
the
trademark
of
founders
products
after
a
sip
it
just
sort
of
melts
in
the
mouth
with
no
prickly
carbonation
leaves
a
tart
sensation
on
the
tongue
and
the
liquid
disappears
making
you
want
more
12
oz

i
can
make
out
that
its
from

2013
pours
a
deep
redviolet

with
two
quick
fingers
worth
of
pink
stained
foam
pretty
solid
lacing
and
retention
aroma
is
raspberry
jam
and
some
caramel
malts
zero
hop
presence
taste
is
similar
with
tart
raspberries
and
malts
not
as
juicy
or
fruity
as
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
but
on
a
similar
page
slightly
syrupy
but
never
daunting
this
is
a
really
solid
fruit
beer
i
just
cant
believe
id
be
in
the
mood
for
it
that
often
o
overall
a
decent
beer
with
a
good
taste
but
the
nose
is
a
miss
for
me
super
sweet
so
wont
be
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
swete
fruity
beers
youll
probably
like
this
one
id
suggest
trying
to
get
some
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
instead
but
worth
checking
out
pours
a
deep
clear
reddish
purple
color
with
a
smallish
pinkwhite
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
smells
like
raspberries
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
is
all
i
can
find
in
the
aroma
really
maybe
a
hint
of
bread
if
i
think
about
it
really
hard
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
malt
in
there
and
a
touch
of
earth
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
a
bit
syrupy
carbonation
is
low
to
moderate
and
the
body
is
moderate
wine
cooler
or
beer
i
enjoyed
this
a
bit
and
i
could
drink
it
again
maybe
not
my
favorite
beer
but
certainly
drinkable
odi
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
years
i
thought
blushing
monk
was
a
gem
too
this
was
a
big
disappointment
too
sweet
sticky
and
onesided
all
things
considered
i
love
me
some
raspberry
beer
and
although
i
donate
a
relatively
harsh
review
this
was
still
pretty
decent
ill
take
this
one
over
cerise
but
its
a
ways
still
from
blushing

works
for
what
it
is
a
nice
treat
after
a
long
hard
days
work
poured
from

into

the
beer
is
a

aromas

rich
darkly
sweet
raspberry
like
when
you
boil
the

when

sweet
heavy

it
does
a
very
good
job
avoiding
the
sugary
or
syrupy
sweet
characteristics
tart
and

the
same
vein
as
cerise
but
for
some
reason
the
raspberry
doesnt
come
through
as
pure
as
the
cherries
did
in
certain
batches
at
least
the
fruit
feel
is
authentic
pours
a
vibrant
red
with
a
fingers
worth
of
light
pink
head
fresh
raspberries
on
the
nose
almost
like
raspberry
pie
first
sip
is
thick
and
sweet
covering
the
entire
inside
of
my
mouth
and
ending
with
a
slight
tartness
that
cuts
the
sugar
mouthfeel
is
excellent
it
want
to
take
really
big
gulps
of
this
the
raspberries
dont
seem
as
fresh
and
bright
on
the
tongue
as
they
did
in
the
aroma
but
the
flavours
are
wellbalanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
malty
backbone
theres
some
bitterness
slight
booze
and
sugary
pastry
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
be
really
refreshing
but
its
extremely
drinkable
and
pretty
delicious
nevertheless
its
a
murky
pinky
red
ale
with
little
to
no
etching
on
the
surface
smells
of
grain
some
grass
a
hint
of
raspberry
not
much
on
the
nose
flavor
is
nice
and
juicy
with
raspberries
and
a
light
adjunct
lager
flavor
in
the
background
the
syrupy
raspberry
gives
the
thin
beer
a
distinct
heaviness
but
my
sense
tells
me
this
is
the
robustness
of
the
fruit
not
the
beer
lighter
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
beer
wish
blushing
monk
was
the
seasonal
though
then
id
be
hunting
for
that
snack
for
sure
o
this
beer
achieves
an
excellent
balance
between
sweetness
and
tartness
as
neither
of
them
stand
out
in
particular
as
this
tastes
like
a
sorbet
i
could
almost
see
this
beer
being
used
as
a
palate
cleanser
between
courses
during
a
beer
dinner
o
not
too
bad
very
new
glarus
like
reminds
me
of
there
raspberry
tart
but
not
as
good
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
i
feel
very
satisfied
well
done
founders
o
the
tartness
of
this
beer
makes
it
a
sipper
but
the
raspberry
flavors
are
among
the
most
authentic
that
ive
had
it
even
has
a
malty
backbone
to
finish
like
a
real
beer
this
one
stands
above
most
of
the
style
o
fabulous
stuff
will
definitely
buy
again
at
least
once
a
summer
its
not
cheap
but
its
a
step
up
from
what
i
was
buying
for
the
same
price
back
home
in
toronto
o
a
decent
beer
overall
and
pretty
good
for
a
fruit
beer
this
beer
was
made
for
mixing
with
other
beers
i
have
seen
examples
of
it
being
mixed
with
imperial
stouts
etc
you
could
drink
it
straight
but
it
might
bore
your
taste
buds
over
time
either
way
its
definitely
worth
a
purchase
this
just
isnt
my
kind
of
beer
there
was
way
too
much
sweet
raspberry
flavor
and
not
much
balance
at
all
its
pretty
onedimensional
o
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
a
real
nice
summer
beer
recommended
cheers
drinkable
on
this
hot
day
out
on
the
porch
poured
a
reddish
framboise
like
body
with
pink
head
and
minimal
lace
i
mostly
smelled
raspberries
with
my
beer
possibly
some
hops
and
grainy
malt
but
to
be
honest
nothing
but
razzies
for
me
i
will
say
that
thankfully
this
beer
isnt
thick
or
sticky
and
by
that
i
mean
the
dominant
taste
profile
is
raspberry
but
its
not
like
drinking
raspberry
flavored
smoothies
with
alcohol
it
is
a
balanced
beer
as
there
are
some
hop
bites
that
add
crisp
bitter
backbite
there
is
some
tart
and
sweetness
and
there
is
a
good
amount
of
raspberry
but
everything
is
balanced
and
it
feels
more
like
a
beer
with
raspberries
not
raspberry
beer
also
i
appreciated
the
balance
because
it
never
gets
too
sugarysweet
but
nor
does
it
get
so
tart
it
borders
on
puckeringsourness
i
still
gave
it
a
low
overall
score
because
personally
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
12
ounces
and
the
pint
i
had
started
to
wear
on
me
pretty
good
beer
that
probably
is
best
served
as
a
dessert
beer
because
it
is
a
little
bit
of
meal
in
a
bottle
overall
maybe
im
spoiled
from
having
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
easily
obtainable
but
rubaeus
definitely
falls
short
of
that
masterpiece
the
raspberry
accents
seem
to
get
slightly
lost
in
a
sugary
blast
a
solid
brew
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
much
more
then
that
ruby
red
in
color
head
quickly
dissipates
just
a
few
wisps
of
foam
remain
freshsweet
raspberry
aroma
very
different
from
a
lambic
in
that
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
on
the
sweeter
side
side
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
this
is
clearly
an
ale
flavored
with
fresh
raspberry
flavoring
and
not
some
alcopop
malt
beverage
aftertaste
pulls
back
the
sweetness
just
prior
to
it
being
a
bit
much
im
not
much
for
fruit
beers
generally
theyre
too
sweet
for
my
taste
this
one
was
really
sweet
and
not
that
enjoyable
like
drinking
a
noncarbonated
soda
o
an
awesome
fruit
beer
a
bit
tiring
on
the
palate
but
still
a
good
beer
it
would
work
well
at
barbecues
on
hot
sunny
afternoons
fairly
easy
to
drink
not
very
complicated
if
you
like
raspberries
youll
most
likely
enjoy
this
was
happy
to
try
this
but
will
not
buy
it
again
overall
this
was
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
a
good
change
of
pace
for
a
summer
seasonal
i
would
recommend
that
anyone
looking
at
trying
this
wait
until
its
hot
as
hell
out
then
go
for
it
o
this
was
a
decent
fruit
beer
that
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
it
was
very
sweet
with
a
light
tartness
and
in
your
face
fruitiness
the
downfall
was
the
overpowering
sweetness
and
the
purée
quality
of
the
fruit
which
definitely
makes
this
beer
something
i
couldnt
palate
drinking
a
lot
of
definitely
an
upgrade
over
cerise
but
still
not
a
beer
that
ill
likely
come
back
to
in
the
near
future
for
someone
searching
for
a
beer
thats
not
all
that
much
like
a
beer
this
would
be
a
good
option
sweet
candy
like
beer
that
comes
from
a
well
known
and
respected
brewer
i
will
not
be
trying
this
again
though
i
might
recommend
it
to
someone
who
is
just
easing
into
beer
from
the
mixed
drink
category
overall
though
one
or
two
is
more
than
enough
for
me
in
a
sitting
i
can
see
this
one
being
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
day
overall
just
another
impressive
solid
and
fun
founders
offering
even
if
it
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
tasting
grade
b
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
very
easy
drinking
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
an
abundance
of
fruit
and
enough
of
a
wheat
grain
base
to
remind
you
this
is
beer
as
it
warms
up
a
slight
tingle
of
that
5
7
starts
to
show
itself
admittedly
i
purchased
a
4pack
of
this
hoping
it
was
an
overloaded
fruity
concoction
that
my
wife
would
enjoy
unfortunately
it
is
no
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
but
it
isnt
bad
either
overall
i
never
thought
i
could
like
a
strictly
raspberry
beer
as
much
as
this
one
nothing
about
it
tastes
artificial
very
tasty
overall
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
out
there
this
is
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
summer
beer
only
downside
is
the
relatively
high
price
given
what
this
beer
is
this
beer
melted
my
brain
in
2009
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
new
release
its
a
fruit
beer
with
some
actual
beer
character
in
there
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
but
a
nice
summer
beer
refreshing
and
a
killer
beer
to
use
as
an
intro
to
the
style
pretty
good
fruit
beer
that
is
like
blushing
monk
lite
still
nowhere
near
anew
glarus
fruit
beers
but
worth
a
try
overall
a
lot
like
cherise
i
dont
see
too
much
difference
way
to
one
dimensional
to
be
great
to
me
i
like
my
fruit
beers
with
more
of
something
else
such
as
a
unique
malt
that
is
stronger
or
some
sourness
to
it
its
not
normal
i
guess
so
have
one
but
its
a
beer
ill
never
have
again
not
good
if
this
is
a
style
stop
making
it
founders
look
guys
youre
better
than
this
overall
not
bad
at
all
i
have
had
other
fruit
beers
i
liked
better
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
fairly
simple
version
and
pretty
refreshing
in
this
texas
heat
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
my
four
pack
m
its
a
light
medium
for
a
fruit
beer
its
really
good
founders
delivers
once
again
i
may
introduce
this
one
to
the
wife
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
as
it
set
a
nice
break
from
the
norm
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fluffy
a
bit
more
than
effervescent
in
a
light
body
its
pretty
crisp
generally
and
the
carbonation
that
continues
to
rise
through
the
session
somehow
isnt
too
overdone
o
probably
my
favorite
fruit
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
having
the
fresh
raspberries
really
make
this
a
standout
in
the
category
very
refreshing
with
a
tart
component
that
really
kicks
this
up
a
notch
85
d
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
but
one
maybe
two
would
be
quite
enough
o
a
very
good
fruit
beer
drinks
more
like
a
raspberry
soda
than
a
beer
a
nice
summer
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
representations
of
raspberry
in
beer
ive
had
a
summer
beer
to
rival
any
other
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
change
of
pace
beer
its
no
where
near
as
good
as
raspberry
tart
but
it
is
something
i
would
drink
again
in
the
future
certainly
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
and
are
interested
in
fruit
beers
o
i
think
founders
did
a
good
job
here
however
if
im
looking
for
a
drink
like
this
ill
go
for
the
tried
and
true
lindemans
i
know
several
people
who
dont
drink
beer
shocking
right
and
they
tried
it
and
enjoyed
it
im
not
sure
if
youre
going
to
convert
your
lady
to
craft
brew
with
this
one
but
its
worth
a
shot
right
its
quite
easy
drinking
but
i
really
wish
the
sweetness
tasted
more
fresh
and
real
despite
the
fact
they
already
use
fresh
raspberries
it
lacks
tartness
and
the
sweetness
is
also
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
however
a
good
summer
beer
and
definitely
a
very
good
introduction
for
those
who
prefer
fruit
flavors
and
sweet
beers
i
liked
it
but
only
marginally
better
than
a
comparable
lineys
product
bottle
picked
up
locally
enjoyed
from
my
cbs
snifter
beer
poured
a
fairly
watery
pink
thin
foamy
head
fizzed
away
as
quick
as
it
appeared
streaky
spotty
lacing
left
traces
of
where
the
beer
was
on
the
glass
as
i
sipped
it
smell
is
raspberry
taste
matches
the
nose
but
is
rather
thick
a
face
full
of
fresh
berries
feel
is
on
the
thick
side
beer
is
fresh
fruit
new
glarus
has
nothiung
to
worry
about
but
this
is
far
from
the
worse
veggie
beer
ive
tried
a
nice
break
from
cerise
but
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
enjoyable
though
glad
to
have
a
4
pack
and
might
need
to
seek
out
another
o
raspberries
thats
about
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
since
thats
about
all
thats
going
on
i
love
raspberries
but
i
look
for
something
more
in
a
beer
other
than
tasting
like
raspberry
juice
mixed
with
a
bit
of
soda
water
its
not
offensive
or
bad
but
there
just
needs
to
be
some
depth
poured
a
rubymahogany
color
with
a
small
ringlet
for
a
head
minimal
lacing
in
the
nose
raspberries
and
lots
of
em
lesser
notes
of
vanilla
and
caramel
malts
taste
was
pretty
much
straightup
raspberry
juice
real
not
candylike
or
artificialtastingcant
imagine
how
much
raspberry
actually
went
into
the
brewsweet
and
syrupy
not
sour
though
there
was
a
bit
of
a
tart
twinge
in
the
finish
also
notes
of
grass
and
malted
cereal
grains
medium
body
syrupy
mouthfeel
lower
carbonation
easydrinkin
stuff
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
obviously
this
beer
isnt
going
to
be
for
everyone
but
it
delivered
what
was
promised
at
least
overall
im
not
big
on
fruit
beers
as
they
usually
seem
artificial
or
medicinal
to
me
but
this
has
a
very
fresh
natural
feel
to
it
this
has
changed
my
idea
of
what
a
fruit
beer
can
be
recommend
trying
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
most
fruity
beers
for
the
reasons
mentioned
above
but
founders
rubaeus
is
easily
one
of
the
better
raspberry
beers
on
the
market
it
is
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
and
tart
and
the
addition
of
natural
raspberries
as
well
as
true
beer
taste
keep
it
real
and
help
it
rank
well
above
the
average
fruity
brew
overall
solid
for
what
it
is
a
fruit
beer
if
your
like
anything
from
sammy
smith
ithaca
apricot
wheat
etc
then
this
is
for
you
my
big
question
is
is
this
really
worth
bottling
again
in
a
speciality
4pack
over
something
like
lets
say
o
i
dunno
cbs
very
good
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
overall
a
very
good
berry
filled
fruit
beer
great
fresh
raspberry
juice
flavor
with
a
nice
subtle
malt
backing
simple
but
very
good
poured
out
as
a
very
nice
looking
red
color
with
a
soft
pinkish
purple
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
pretty
good
on
this
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
fruity
plenty
of
sweet
fresh
raspberry
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
packed
with
raspberry
flavors
with
a
subtle
wheat
malt
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
a
little
syrupy
with
a
gentle
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
i
enjoy
it
but
i
wouldnt
wanna
drink
a
lot
of
it
in
one
session
o
its
a
welldone
fruit
beer
i
wouldve
enjoyed
a
more
tart
flavor
and
finish
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
definitely
happy
that
this
is
back
at
least
for
the
time
being
in
founders
rotational
lineup
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
real
fruit
and
not
artificial
sweetener
absolutely
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
on
the
market
overall
a
delicious
beer
for
the
right
occasion
i
could
also
see
it
as
a
bit
of
a
stepping
stone
in
multiple
ways
either
as
a
foray
for
a
nonbeer
drinker
into
the
world
of
suds
or
for
someone
who
doesnt
really
like
fruit
beers
this
one
has
something
for
everyone
and
is
so
drinkable
that
it
would
be
easy
to
get
carried
away
as
it
is
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
the
category
it
is
going
for
founders
knocks
another
one
out
of
the
park
imho
lots
of
tart
raspberry
flavor
and
grainy
sweetness
full
bodied
that
things
out
a
little
on
the
finish
tartness
doesnt
linger
too
much
sweetness
lingers
a
bit
but
its
not
overly
sweet
a
little
sticky
though
not
as
refreshing
as
most
fruit
beers
heavy
body
and
thick
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
1
and
with
how
rare
pricey
it
is
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
preferred
cerise
o
this
beer
is
all
its
advertised
to
be
a
supreme
raspberry
ale
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
actually
so
if
you
dont
like
in
wisconsin
this
is
exactly
what
your
missing
a
nice
bright
raspberry
flavor
in
a
beer
seek
this
one
out
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
at
the
top
among
the
best
overall
if
i
can
get
it
thisll
be
a
mainstay
for
the
summer
nice
job
rubaeus
is
worth
trying
even
at
the
1
markup
that
i
threw
down
for
this
four
pack
its
a
good
buy
as
most
anything
from
founders
is
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
fine
creamy
pinkish
head
plenty
of
juicy
raspberries
in
the
nose
clean
and
sweet
slightly
earthy
and
natural
smelling
raspberry
flavor
almost
becomes
too
sweet
but
is
saved
by
a
late
subtle
tartness
that
keeps
things
out
of
syrupy
territory
fresh
simple
fruity
and
dry
extremely
drinkable
would
be
a
nice
choice
for
a
summer
drinker
is
not
for
the
price
tag
o
a
straightforward
tasty
fruit
beer
refreshing
too
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
overall
a
delightful
addition
to
the
founders
stable
and
an
appropriate
substitute
for
cerise
yet
in
my
opinion
its
a
little
pricey
for
the
quality
nevertheless
if
the
supply
at
my
local
bottle
shop
holds
out
i
can
see
myself
splurging
on
another
4pack
of
this
to
get
me
through
the
hot
summer
months
worth
trying
on
a
warm
summer
evening
o
solid
fruit
beer
and
well
done
i
prefer
the
added
dimensions
of
the
new
glarus
but
do
enjoy
founders
efforts
in
short
this
is
easily
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
to
date
and
my
only
regret
is
that
the
case
i
picked
up
was
the
absolute
last
and
i
wont
be
able
to
get
even
more
raspberries
are
one
of
my
favorite
fruits
more
beery
than
a
new
glarus
or
blushing
monk
but
the
fruit
is
clearly
dominant
i
need
to
buy
more
of
these
overall
i
am
happy
that
they
brought
this
back
as
i
prefer
it
over
cerise
but
i
am
partial
to
raspberries
over
cherries
so
this
definitely
isnt
my
style
of
beers
however
since
its
a
founders
ill
give
it
a
try
it
pours
a
purple
brown
with
a
purple
lace
very
strange
looking
for
a
beer
the
smell
is
extremely
sweet
with
an
absolute
ton
of
raspberry
hitting
you
right
in
the
face
the
taste
is
more
of
a
raspberry
soda
than
beer
very
sweet
and
a
nice
tart
end
its
actually
put
together
rather
nice
which
shouldnt
come
as
a
surprise
from
founders
the
feel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
it
does
fit
with
the
sweetness
overall
i
have
to
say
it
has
a
place
a
dessert
beer
perhaps
or
a
summer
party
for
what
this
beer
is
its
pretty
good
and
will
have
place
in
the
fridge
at
he
right
place
and
time
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
complex
no
good
yes
well
worth
seeking
out
and
drinking
again
overall
this
beer
delivered
on
what
it
promised
raspberries
raspberries
and
more
raspberries
i
would
have
liked
it
if
it
was
a
bit
more
tart
and
not
entirely
fruity
but
overall
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
havent
had
a
raspberry
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
till
i
had
this
one
it
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
tartness
and
raspberry
flavors
were
really
nice
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
not
filling
refreshing
and
the
flavor
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
the
sweetness
would
prevent
me
fore
drinking
a
lot
of
this
i
think
two
would
be
my
limit
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
aroma
they
were
both
really
nice
and
full
of
raspberrys
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
it
was
a
little
high
and
if
it
was
toned
down
a
little
it
would
help
the
drinkability
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
they
choose
to
release
it
again
its
priced
and
right
and
its
pretty
enjoyable
i
recommend
this
to
people
who
like
fruit
beers
and
if
your
a
big
fan
of
raspberrys
then
this
beer
is
a
must
try
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
did
a
great
job
at
capturing
the
pure
essence
of
the
raspberry
so
far
its
my
favorite
raspberry
beer
and
i
like
it
much
more
than
cerise
its
got
to
be
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
had
founders
seems
to
be
the
jack
of
all
trades
they
can
do
stouts
barrel
aged
beers
and
hoppy
beers
really
well
and
now
they
proved
to
me
that
they
have
some
skills
when
it
comes
tor
fruit
beers
good
work
guys
taste
was
extremely
clean
sweet
but
not
over
powerful
sweet
i
had
this
alongside
the
bells
wild
raspberry
which
was
much
more
tart
compared
to
this
this
was
very
smooth
definitely
something
i
would
try
again
hoping
i
can
find
some
bottles
at
a
store
in
nyc
after
having
had
quite
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
beer
this
summer
ive
come
a
cross
a
few
that
have
a
slight
chalkiness
and
medicinal
character
to
them
nothing
like
cerise
just
a
twinge
in
the
background
at
times
other
bottles
seem
to
be
completely
void
of
this
however
so
im
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
still
a
great
beer
but
maybe
not
as
perfect
as
i
thought
it
was
at
first
o
havent
tried
enough
good
fruit
beers
but
i
had
to
try
this
since
it
was
from
founders
and
has
received
some
buzz
around
where
i
live
o
hoping
to
stock
up
before
this
one
is
gone
so
great
overall
a
winner
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
quite
refreshing
great
overall
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
fruit
beers
the
pour
is
amber
in
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
a
very
sweet
fruit
aroma
to
this
as
expected
lots
of
raspberry
with
maybe
a
touch
of
cherry
to
it
as
well
not
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
notes
of
sugar
and
raspberry
maybe
just
a
little
bit
of
lemon
in
there
too
do
held
up
pretty
well
would
drink
again
but
dont
know
how
much
longer
this
will
still
taste
good
per
usual
im
bless
i
live
so
close
to
new
glarus
as
no
other
fruit
beers
come
close
thanks
for
the
cellar
save
taturbo
aroma
is
definitely
raspberries
but
the
taste
came
across
as
a
nice
balance
of
raspberries
and
malt
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
too
syrupy
at
all
although
there
is
more
than
a
hint
of
the
berries
in
the
taste
still
finishes
somewhat
dry
and
tart
excellent
fruit
beer
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
poured
into
a
tulip
the
color
on
this
is
really
nice
a
hazy
red
that
reminds
me
of
grapefruit
juice
no
head
on
this
but
it
still
has
a
solid
body
that
looks
terrific
the
smell
is
shockingly
enough
full
of
raspberries
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
this
is
fun
to
smell
the
taste
is
slightly
tart
raspberries
to
start
and
a
nice
subtly
sweet
finish
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sipping
on
easy
to
drink
and
will
be
missed
appears
a
clouded
yeast
ridden
suspension
tone
pink
tinged
with
a
large
foamy
pink
head
looks
a
bit
like
raspberry
jame
in
color
thin
lace
sticks
sporadically
around
my
pint
glass
aroma
has
strong
raspberry
puree
not
overly
candy
but
it
has
a
nice
earthy
mix
that
goes
really
well
tegether
even
a
bit
of
raspberry
seed
flavors
toss
in
tart
raspberry
slurry
touch
of
alcohol
presence
with
realy
natural
semi
swee
fruit
juice
notes
again
its
hard
to
deny
the
earthy
raspberry
seed
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisply
carbonated
with
an
assertive
sparking
raspberry
wine
dryness
left
behind
on
the
palate
not
syrupy
or
overly
sweet
at
any
time
a
killer
fruit
ale
drinkability
is
solid
all
around
strudy
alcohol
stands
up
to
the
earthy
fruit
sweetness
a
surprisingly
pleasant
experience
in
my
glass
overall
very
tasty
and
way
better
than
cerise
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
this
is
top
notch
aged
id
greatly
recommend
grabbing
a
bottle
from
someone
if
any
remain
its
too
bad
this
is
retired
cerise
what
is
this
crap
d
think
this
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
definitely
some
age
on
it
at
a
guaranteed
year
on
it
definitely
has
its
merits
still
but
has
seen
better
days
i
will
continue
to
have
my
last
couple
periodically
thru
the
summer
and
still
enjoy
them
but
i
know
i
waited
too
long
on
these
and
missed
out
on
a
better
experience
with
these
oh
well
only
so
much
you
can
drink
d
not
bad
just
not
a
favorite
of
mine
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
fling
saucer
globe
i
guess
this
has
been
discontinued
for
a
while
but
since
i
wont
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
again
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
review
this
beer
pours
a
mashed
raspberry
red
with
a
decent
2
inch
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
from
the
reviews
ive
read
before
the
aroma
has
kind
of
dwindled
off
crush
sweet
raspberries
with
a
little
bit
of
pilsner
malt
thats
all
that
really
comes
through
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
crushed
sweet
raspberries
mixed
with
a
light
malt
flavor
just
a
slight
hint
of
oxidization
which
is
a
bit
surprising
because
most
of
the
older
twist
top
founders
bottles
ive
had
have
a
heavy
layer
of
cardboard
the
mouthfeel
is
light
leaving
a
lingering
raspberry
on
the
palate
over
all
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
have
like
to
have
it
fresh
dthis
would
be
so
easy
to
drink
glass
after
glass
of
and
if
it
was
still
around
i
probably
would
if
youre
into
a
sweeter
beer
this
one
is
definitely
for
you
double
if
youre
a
fan
of
raspberries
d
i
like
this
one
for
its
simplicity
and
the
body
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
however
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
because
of
lack
of
complexity
and
character
f
slightly
bitter
and
dries
off
a
bit
but
mostly
still
the
raspberry
juice
this
is
not
a
beer
its
a
fermented
raspberry
juice
this
might
be
great
for
some
people
especially
a
feminine
beer
but
the
complete
lack
of
any
real
beer
qualities
makes
this
not
reach
anywhere
near
my
top
beers
i
wish
i
only
got
1
instead
of
a
4
pack
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
all
craft
drinkers
alike
that
want
to
enjoy
an
ale
full
of
rasberries
with
a
funky
tartness
that
doesnt
overpower
the
but
isnt
underwhelming
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
refreshing
fruit
beer
i
enjoy
fruit
beers
when
they
are
done
well
and
this
is
an
example
of
one
i
find
rubaeus
to
be
much
better
than
cerise
and
wish
founders
would
brew
this
one
again
it
seems
to
have
held
up
pretty
well
with
age
considering
its
style
pours
a
purpley
brown
color
moderate
khakipink
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
tart
raspberries
with
a
cereal
grain
background
taste
follows
scent
with
delicious
tart
raspberries
and
a
nice
cereal
grain
backbone
medium
bodied
sligltly
syrupy
but
not
overly
coating
and
no
major
aftertaste
good
carbonation
for
an
older
bottle
great
fruit
beer
from
founders
one
of
the
best
would
love
to
taste
a
fresh
one
if
ever
produced
again
im
sad
to
see
it
go
but
this
beer
has
seen
better
days
nb
a
bit
watery
stick
with
blushing
monk
however
it
does
come
through
that
they
used
real
raspberries
which
tend
to
be
quite
expensive
as
opposed
to
artificial
flavor
and
corn
syrup
sour
and
tart
but
not
too
puckering
that
nicely
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
raspberries
and
syrupy
fruit
flavor
this
sweetness
is
still
the
dominant
flavor
but
without
the
slight
tart
feel
it
would
be
a
bit
overbearing
overall
i
really
dig
rübæus
it
was
the
first
fruit
beer
i
ever
tried
and
unfortunately
it
will
be
no
more
very
soon
i
will
continue
to
search
for
however
much
is
left
on
planet
earth
thank
you
founders
for
the
good
memories
easy
to
drink
great
in
the
heat
a
real
shame
this
is
going
away
12oz
2008
release
figured
id
better
get
it
now
before
you
cant
anymore
poured
a
cloudy
reddishpink
loses
color
saturation
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
small
raspberry
and
yeast
particles
float
throughout
rather
nice
to
look
at
actually
rigorous
pour
produced
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aromas
were
tart
raspberries
thats
it
tastes
were
also
tart
raspberries
with
a
nice
biscuity
malt
backbone
providing
excellent
balance
and
drinkability
had
this
backtoback
with
cerise
and
i
prefer
this
one
although
they
are
similar
refreshing
with
the
alcohol
wellconcealed
this
was
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
i
ever
had
if
youve
had
the
cerise
now
its
very
similar
but
obviously
with
a
raspberry
flavor
the
pour
is
a
nice
pinkish
red
smells
and
tastes
like
raspberry
soda
but
also
has
somewhat
of
a
beer
character
to
it
again
like
cerise
its
similar
to
a
lambic
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
giving
it
a
really
high
drinkability
i
you
are
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
certainly
look
for
it
if
not
try
it
anyway
it
may
not
be
loaded
with
hops
and
malt
but
its
delicious
the
body
is
a
bit
over
carbonated
and
leaves
a
slight
carbonic
bite
this
with
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
of
a
distraction
the
fruit
is
light
but
does
linger
into
the
finish
overall
a
easy
drinking
beer
that
brings
out
more
beer
than
fruity
the
fruit
is
subtle
and
not
too
girly
but
i
think
that
is
the
appeal
for
beer
geeks
drinkability
another
stellar
beer
from
founders
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticable
and
this
almost
drinks
like
a
sour
due
to
the
tartness
of
the
raspberry
i
could
easily
drink
a
four
pack
of
this
and
am
disappointed
that
it
is
going
away
it
is
a
nice
change
from
the
typical
wheat
fruit
beers
d
sad
to
see
it
go
but
loved
it
while
it
was
here
a
decent
abv
and
a
good
taste
i
could
drink
a
4pack
no
problem
great
warm
weather
beer
to
bad
its
on
hiatus
as
of
now
easy
to
drink
not
sure
i
would
actively
hunt
this
down
but
if
it
was
an
extra
i
would
gladly
down
another
one
well
done
founders
drinkability
every
time
i
drink
this
beauty
i
love
it
more
and
more
im
a
huge
fan
of
any
beer
with
fruit
or
coffee
in
it
and
this
is
one
of
the
bests
its
so
drinkable
and
although
the
raspberry
is
fairly
strong
its
not
overbearing
an
absolute
gem
that
founders
needs
to
keep
on
a
brewing
true
to
trend
the
beer
overwhelmingly
tastes
like
raspberry
too
sweet
raspberry
only
slightly
tart
infinitely
drinkable
and
refreshing
there
isnt
much
depth
here
at
all
its
a
one
trick
pony
but
it
doesnt
really
need
anything
else
it
does
that
one
trick
very
well
a
little
thin
in
mouth
but
thats
really
it
if
you
want
something
sweet
and
fruity
without
being
artificially
cloying
or
oversweetened
this
is
it
here
ive
had
blushing
monk
a
while
ago
and
this
is
basically
a
less
potent
less
complex
slightly
less
awesome
version
of
it
but
now
that
i
know
this
is
being
discontinued
i
might
grab
a
bunch
to
keep
around
for
the
summer
months
i
just
cant
stop
drinking
it
taste
is
good
again
fruity
raspberry
slightly
dry
finish
which
is
nice
mouthfeel
is
nice
perfect
carbonation
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
review
in
no
way
is
it
a
great
beer
nor
is
it
a
bad
one
it
is
not
complex
in
any
way
but
for
what
it
is
it
tastes
pretty
darn
good
it
is
a
raspberry
beer
and
if
you
like
raspberries
and
beer
this
is
worth
a
shot
had
on
tap
from
possibly
the
last
keg
of
this
beer
left
in
the
world
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
deep
red
color
with
a
finger
of
soapy
white
head
smells
light
and
wheaty
with
strong
raspberry
smell
taste
is
like
raspberry
preserves
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
light
mouthfeel
awesome
drinkability
im
not
a
big
fruit
beer
fan
but
this
beer
is
great
its
a
shame
this
is
now
retired
another
excellent
example
from
founders
come
back
rubaeus
very
raspberry
in
the
taste
a
bit
puckery
but
it
tastes
like
a
small
amount
of
hops
are
in
there
but
the
raspberry
dominates
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
but
mouthfeel
is
phlegmy
and
mucusy
my
last
bottle
of
rubaeus
from
the
cellar
i
hear
this
ones
going
on
hiatus
and
being
replaced
by
cherise
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
snifter
appears
a
beautiful
shade
of
maroon
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
pink
foam
smell
and
taste
is
dominated
by
what
else
raspberries
the
flavor
is
tart
and
refreshing
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
moderate
body
and
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
fruit
beer
one
that
i
believe
was
made
for
people
that
are
not
keen
on
the
usual
fruit
beers
this
is
akin
to
a
raspberry
ipa
so
if
that
sounds
like
something
youd
dig
seek
this
one
out
and
give
it
a
try
before
it
goes
on
vacation
if
there
ever
was
a
beer
that
mimicked
a
wine
cooler
this
would
be
it
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
for
people
who
do
not
like
beer
and
that
cant
be
bad
thanks
brian
for
the
trip
down
memory
lane
cant
give
it
a
good
drinkability
rating
unfortunately
im
not
a
major
fan
of
raspberries
but
thats
not
it
i
just
dont
think
it
had
as
much
beer
character
as
it
should
have
this
was
too
much
about
the
berries

ones
that
i

very

drinking
would

be

on

i
can

some

call

a

beer
the
cerise
has
some
big
shoes
to
fill
but
i
think
it
will
do
alright
drinkability
an
interesting
and
unique
brew
im
not
much
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
im
a
huge
fan
of
founders
so
i
knew
i
had
to
give
this
one
a
try
it
didnt
disappoint
very
authentic
and
very
intense
sweet
and
fruity
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
and
fruity
for
some
but
pleasant
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
and
though
its
certainly
no
ng
raspberry
tart
its
solid
and
tasty
nitro
tap
at
the
founders
brewery
a
dark
red
color
with
a
creamy
head
definitely
a
raspberry
beer
maybe
with
some
cranberry
or
cherry
flavor
in
there
as
well
very
sweet
but
it
is
refreshing
i
had
no
idea
this
beer
was
around
7
when
i
tried
it
wouldve
guessed
much
lower
cant
wait
to
pick
it
up
again
a
fine
beer
the
rubaeus
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
on
the
market
in
my
opinion
rivals
the
new
glarus
belgian
red
and
the
dfh
aprihop
for
quality
and
production
a
delicious
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have
more
than
one
of
in
the
fridge
a
berry
red
color
pour
with
a
creamy
pink
head
aroma
is
tart
berries
with
a
hint
of
grain
flavor
is
tart
raspberries
with
some
dry
grainand
a
kiss
of
hops
a
sharp
mouthfeelthin
boddyhoppy
finish
this
is
not
my
favorite
stylepretty
much
like
a
juice
box
a
good
desert
brew
treat
it
as
such
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
rübæus
is
an
okay
fruit
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
one
suffers
the
same
flaws
as
others
primarily
its
very
heavy
on
fruit
and
sweetness
and
short
on
ordinary
good
beer
qualities
theres
some
here
but
not
enough
that
being
said
its
okay
its
difficult
to
offer
any
meaningful
criticism
thatd
probably
lead
to
it
no
longer
being
a
fruitvegetable
beer
all
in
all
its
alright
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
not
very
high
good
for
a
dessert
beer
d
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
one
at
a
time
for
me
though
da
very
nice
fruit
beer
that
doesnt
become
cloying
makes
for
a
good
dessert
i
could
use
a
bit
more
head
but
who
couldnt
pretty
drinkable
beer
nice
for
some
raspberry
craving
ps
they
also
make
an
imperial
version
blushing
monk
i
have
yet
to
try
this
but
really
want
to
girlfriend
flat
out
loves
this
stuff
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
berry
weiss
but
still
has
lots
of
good
aroma
and
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
and
you
can
definitely
smell
the
raspberries
we
love
drinking
lindemans
framboise
but
you
cannot
drink
that
in
quantity
this
is
the
perfect
balance
of
fruit
flavor
in
a
beer
merged
with
drinkability
has
a
fairly
high
alcohol
content
to
boot
a
few
of
these
will
definitely
satisfy
you
on
a
fridaysaturday
night
if
you
are
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
or
if
your
lady
is
so
inclined
price
can
be
a
bit
high
we
paid
9
49
for
a
4pack
but
worth
it
if
you
love
it
pretend
its
2
50
bottles
at
the
bar
a
nice
example
of
how
to
balance
fruit
with
beer
and
not
go
too
far
in
either
direction
highly
recommended
rübæus
pours
a
nice
vibrant
red
with
just
enough
brown
notes
to
suggest
this
isnt
artificially
colored
minimal
head
just
white
lacing
five
minutes
after
pour
into
glass
aroma
is
very
subdued
raspberry
mildly
sweet
malty
aroma
the
sip
has
an
exquisite
tartness
that
i
wasnt
expecting
really
a
unique
beer
there
is
just
a
really
nice
lowkey
sweetness
from
the
raspberry
but
the
sourness
is
what
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
hides
the
almost
7
pretty
darn
well
the
drinkability
numbers
are
a
pinch
lower
than
they
should
be
because
the
raspberry
sweetness
might
get
a
bit
cloying
after
too
many
of
these
very
nice
fruit
beer
from
the
good
folks
at
founders
it
falls
somewhere
in
between
a
raspberry
lambic
and
a
sour
ale
not
fully
either
though
quite
drinkable
in
moderation
would
probably
pair
well
with
cheese
and
nuts
not
necessary
a
full
meal
d
incredible
it
really
acheives
a
superb
drinkability
would
compliment
dessert
quite
well
especially
pie
ala
mode
mmm
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
quite
good
i
like
the
raspberries
and
if
i
had
to
choose
a
fruit
beer
this
would
be
toward
the
top
of
my
list
its
just
like
blushing
monk
but
not
as
strong
a
perfect
little
brother
got
this
one
cause
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
founders
brews
and
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
raspberryy
this
one
is
basically
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
small
tan
head
nose
is
raspberries
sweet
malt
flavor
is
lightly
tart
with
a
strong
sweet
raspberry
flavor
as
well
and
a
light
hop
background
im
a
fan
of
good
fruit
beers
and
i
think
this
one
qualifies
very
similar
to
the
blushing
monk
just
10
cheaper
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
and
would
again
if
in
a
mood
drinkability
very
good
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
had
the
fruit
flavor
seems
fresh
not
the
usual
syrupy
or
fake
flavors
most
fruit
beers
have
pours
a
rich
raspberry
color
but
the
head
is
lacking
the
nose
is
of
sweet
berries
and
light
grains
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
tart
raspberries
followed
by
some
subtle
malts
body
is
a
little
fizzy
but
goes
down
well
a
nicely
balanced
fruit
beer
good
stuff
12
oz
brown
bottle
w
twistoff
cap
no
freshness
date
d
notes
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
which
makes
this
drinkable
fruit
derived
bitterness
adds
to
drinkability
to
close
to
carbonated
koolaid
for
my
liking
md
medium
bodied
and
slightly
stickysyrupy
on
the
feel
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
quality
fruit
beers
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
ones
a
treat
but
if
i
want
a
raspberry
beer
id
grab
the
ng
one
unfortunately
im
going
to
struggle
finishing
this
because
of
the
flavor
it
is
far
too
fruity
for
my
liking
or
to
even
really
be
a
beer
in
my
opinion
my
first
thought
when
pouring
this
beer
was
of
rhubarb
and
the
color
could
be
called
a
rhubarb
not
really
brown
at
all
or
as
dark
as
i
would
expect
it
is
actually
fairly
pale
in
color
sweet
tart
raspberries
rush
my
nose
it
is
a
a
very
focused
and
highly
sweet
aroma
almost
like
a
mead
smells
a
bit
of
rhubarb
as
well
and
a
garden
too
for
that
matter
the
taste
itself
is
actually
not
that
sweet
at
all
fairly
tart
and
it
tastes
of
rhubarb
as
well
it
has
a
rather
vegetal
taste
to
it
the
finish
is
actually
a
bit
sweeter
with
the
characteristics
of
the
nose
finally
manifesting
themselves
mouthfell
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
mildly
chewy
and
rather
easygoing
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
this
one
berry
flavor
comes
through
in
a
fairly
understated
way
a
touch
sweet
not
all
that
tart
malt
flavors
are
a
little
bready
giving
this
a
suprisingly
full
body
for
what
might
be
expected
for
a
fruit
beer
theres
some
slickness
on
the
palate
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
after
the
swallow
its
thirst
quenching
due
to
the
fruit
element
the
full
body
would
limit
me
to
one
or
two
although
its
not
overbearing
just
a
little
filling
this
was
a
very
well
crafted
fruit
beer
that
mixes
fresh
raspberry
character
with
a
great
drinkibility
that
belies
its
higher
abv
im
sad
to
hear
that
this
will
be
going
on
a
hiatus
drink
up
while
you
can
d
a
good
fruit
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
its
no
lambic
small
raspberry
aftertaste
kind
of
faint

it
crys
out

more
a

than
most

could
also
almost
smell
the
vine
that
they
came
off
of
the
earth
factor

it
a
more
realistic
fruit
beer
characteristic
i
think
taste
was
of
tart
rasberries
with
some
lime
citrus
character
and
sugar
flavor
of
mild
raspberry

i
wouldnt
turn

this
dark

brew
had
an
exceptional
rasberry
smell

taste

im
immediately
partial
to
this

of
their
reputation
for
delicious
unique
beers
even
so
just
a
white
ring
around
the
edge
of

was

this

only
show
themselves
in

theres
some

this
is

would
leave
me
wanting
something
better
maybe
im
just
getting

summer
offering
from
founders
really
surprised
me
fruit
beers
are
usually
not
too
great
and
they
are
usually
either
super
sweet
or
super
tart
and
this
is
one
of
them
for
those
who
cant
handle
the
overthetop
fruit
mimicry
done
by
new
glarus
which
i

are
excellent

i
wonder
if
i
could
handle
drinking
more

these

reminds
me
more
of
a
raspberry
wine
very
good
complete

bomb
disappointed
by
this
i
could
drink
this
all
day
everyday
deliciously
sweet
and
satisfying
absolutely
delicious
the
slightly
sour
raspberry
taste
compliments
the
smooth
sweetness
of
the
beer
would
definitely
recommend
despite
being
brewed
with
raspberries
i
get
a
lot
of
strawberry
sweetness
that
seems
to
balance
this
out
nicely
the
malt
is
hidden
but
it
stills
gives
off
a
beer
flavor
thats
reminds
you
that
this
is
not
a
smirnoff
ice
its
rubaeus
on
steroids
for
sure
which
makes
it
a
better
experience
o
an
awesome
beer
wife
said
it
tastes
like
a
pushpop
she
dug
it
well
done
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
pinkish
color
it
has
a
great
raspberry
smell
to
it
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
and
tastes
strongly
of
rasberries
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
smell
and
taste
this
was
a
top
notch
fruit
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
awesome
lots
of
raspberries
but
drinks
a
little
hot
for
a
berliner
right
now
it
needs
some
age
on
it
but
i
think
it
will
be
really
good
once
i
cellar
it
for
a
while
clear
pink
lots
of
raspberries
not
much
else
but
the
raspberry
flavor
is
spot
on
not
artificial
at
all
overall
a
massively
tasty
brew
that
having
it
now
id
be
hard
pressed
to
want
to
cellar
this
one
for
very
long
cant
for
see
present
flavor
developing
more
favorable
but
maybe
one
day
ill
see
regardless
good
to
have
this
one
making
another
appearance
slightly
medicinal
in
flavor
without
being
offputting
a
brilliant
garnet
with
a
2
5
lacy
pink
foam
cap
that
slowly
dissipates
s
big
fresh
raspberry
nose
laced
with
tartness
t
raspberry
and
lemon
with
light
grains
m
medium
body
and
above
medium
carbonation
o
i
have
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
the
bottle
is
more
carbonated
and
is
an
excellent
tart
fruit
ale
and
the
carbonation
helps
tame
the
fruit
the
tap
version
was
barely
drinkable
overall
good
but
not
great
i
can
see
this
one
becoming
really
nice
in
a
couple
of
years
but
as
for
now
it
could
use
a
little
something
to
take
the
edge
off
the
sweetness
a
bit
more
alcohol
in
the
taste
might
be
nice
too
a
bit
sweet
but
nailed
the
stylethinking
a
few
years
of
age
will
do
this
some
good
interesting
beer
on
draft
too
much
berry
juice
flavor
for
me
i
wanted
to
drop
an
ice
cube
in
it
and
drink
it
like
a
high
schooler
drinks
a
wine
cooler
just
fruit
fruit
and
more
fruit
not
my
cup
of
tea
served
as
a
cordial
this
would
be
divine
as
a
beer
its
unevenperhaps
it
was
foolish
of
me
to
try
to
drink
so
much
all
by
myself
i
tend
to
like
sweet
and
intense
fruitforward
beers
but
blushing
monk
came
across
as
a
cloyingly
and
somewhat
artificial
mixed
berry
flavored
mess
this
beer
has
nothing
on
new
glaruss
raspberry
tart
imperial
rubaeus
sums
up
blushing
monk
pretty
nicely
a
really
great
fruit
beer
theres
no
style
that
founders
doesnt
do
well
found
this
to
be
overly
sweet
and
one
dimensional
its
a
raspberry
bomb
i
would
like
some
more
complexity
i
wont
be

again

this
beer
is
really
not
my
style
i
can
see
where
people
who
like
this
style
would
love
this
beer
a
dessert
beer
it
really
pulls
off
the
sweet
with
tart
without
being
too
obnoxious
well
executed
had
it
on
draft
very
strong
raspberry
taste
a
bit
sweet
a
little
boozy
pretty
good
i
have
this
weird
affinity
for
raspberries
so
i
knew
i
would
love
this

no

there
the

the

overwhelms
everything

cant
even

no

its
like

2015
vintage
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
deep
vibrant
ruby
coloring
with
a
tall
frothy
pinktinged
head
that
quickly
settles
out
into
a
frothy
surface
coating
aromas
of
richly
sweet
and
subtly
tart
raspberries
almost
identical
to
the
smell
when
you
are
making
jello
and
add
the
hot
water
to
the
powder
really
all
encompassing
the
nose
but
if
you
dig
there
are
some
hints
of
candi
sugar
and
a
bready
backbone
flavors
are
all
raspberry
forward
richly
sweet
and
with
a
subtle
tart
character
that
puckers
your
mouth
just
a
bit
the
beer
is
big
with
a
dry
undertone
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
really
smooth
and
tasty
some
subtle
bready
and
sugary
notes
are
mixed
in
the
palate
as
well
and
work
as
perfect
accent
notes
this
is
an
insanely
drinkable
beer
the
abv
is
extremely
hidden
the
aftertaste
is
a
subtle
linger
of
the
raspberry
fruit
notes
leading
into
a
smooth
lingering
tart
and
dry
finish
this
is
a
tasty
damn
beer

huge

cant
find
much
to
count
against
it
bravo
founders
o
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
though
it
might
pair
better
with
a
chocolate
dessert
vs
a
main
course
verdict
a
nice
fruit
beer
from
founders
imperial
rubaeus
wouldnt
be
out
of
the
question
a
bit
sweet
and
syrupy
heavy
and
very
one
dimensional
just
plain
raspberry
juice
the
booze
starts
to
come
through
a
bit
which
adds
to
the
harshness
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
refreshing
and
enjoyable
great
for
an
afternoon
session
this
is
a
robetussin
clone
and
they
almost
naked
it
buy
i
prefer
the
real
stuff
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
hope
they
dont
wait
5
years
or
whatever
to
make
it
again
whenever
they
do
make
it
ill
be
a
buyer
fruity
but
with
a
heavy
mouth
feel
not
smooth
good
but
not
great
pours
a
beautiful
crimson
red
with
a
fluffy
pink
head
absolutely
stunning
in
appearance
lovely
smell
from
the
glass
the
taste
is
intense
raspberry
this
would
vd
heaven
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
will
seek
out
more
of
this
gem
tastes
like
carbonated
cough
syrup
or
like
the
syrupy
lindemans
lambic
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
low
b
wonderful
sweet
raspberry
beer
has
enough
effervescence
to
not
make
it
to
sweet
though
very
enjoyable
overall
this
seem
more
like
a
champagne
than
a
beer
in
the
aromas
and
feel
it
has
a
medicinal
cough
medicone
aroma
that
turned
me
off
at
first
but
the
raspberry
character
opened
up
as
it
warmed
this
would
be
a
nice
brew
to
drink
on
new
years
or
something
i
definitely
wouldnt
gravitate
towards
it
though
since
this
isnt
one
of
my
go
to
style
of
beers
i
can
see
the
chicks
really
diggin
it
fun
beer
to
try
taste
and
smell
are
a
bit
artificial
but
delicious
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
syrupy
overall
a
good
tasting
raspberry
beer
but
needs
more
natural
tartness
to
reach
the
next
level
there
is
a
reason
why
most
raspberry
beers
are
sours
worth
a
try
but
spend
your
time
and
money
seeking
out
the
better
raspberry
sour
beers
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
fruit
beers
can
be
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
takes
that
big
fruity
flavor
that
i
always
look
for
in
the
style
and
it
adds
just
enough
complexity
to
make
it
just
not
a
one
note
beer
and
in
the
end
it
makes
for
one
tasty
beer
this
beer
has
nice
drinkability
its
smooth
slightly
refreshing
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
its
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
does
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
glass
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
i
might
attempt
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
is
that
it
showcases
the
raspberry
in
all
its
glory
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
is
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
they
release
it
again
and
i
got
a
few
bottles
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
i
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
raspberry
beers
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
though
rubaes
was
pretty
damn
good
but
this
one
just
raised
the
bar
another
notch
and
founder
did
everything
right
with
this
beer
its
not
a
favorite
founders
beer
but
it
is
my
favorite
non
sour
raspberry
beer
great
job
guys
this
is
one
awesome
beer
keep
it
up
o
a
beer
for
raspberry
lovers
its
undoubtedly
the
highlight
of
the
beer
and
never
backs
down
the
belgian
yeast
adds
a
nice
complexity
and
depth
while
staying
in
the
background
highly
drinkable
despite
the
9
2
and
very
enjoyable
definitely
worth
looking
into
if
youre
into
belgians
or
raspberry
focused
anything
very
strong
raspberry
flavor
slightly
tart
aroma
is
medicinal
and
i
get
more
cherry
and
cranberry
than
raspberry
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
cloying
with
hints
of
cranberry
juice
on
the
flavor
oily
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
palette
with
flavors
that
i
dont
find
to
be
particularly
enjoyable
quite
disappointing
almost
like
a
zinfandel
wine
overall
iso
more
im
struggling
to
see
how
this
beer
is
any
different
from
rubaeus
i
echo
vtrs
sentiments
almost
exactly
except
for
the
fact
that
i
am
usually
into
most
belgian
styles
this
is
a
less
intense
raspberry
framboise
something
i
would
never
think
of
enjoying
straight
up
4
oz
pour
more
than
does
the
trick
had
this
on
tap
for
the
first
time
poured
a
bright
red
in
a
pint
glass
smell
was
pretty
much
straight
up
raspberries
with
maybe
a
little
bit
of
yeast
great
nose
that
let
you
know
what
you
were
going
to
be
in
for
taste
was
raspberry
great
raspberry
taste
that
was
not
overly
sweet
or
medicinal
it
tasted
pretty
natural
to
me
what
i
found
interesting
was
that
with
the
sweet
nose
and
taste
it
ended
pretty
dry
which
made
it
a
lot
more
enjoyable
to
me
there
was
some
carbonation
almost
fizzy
like
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
considering
i
am
not
a
huge
belgian
fan
i
did
not
think
the
alcohol
was
hot
rather
i
thought
it
was
well
masked
i
brought
a
growler
of
this
that
night
it
was
a
great
beer
to
sip
by
the
pool
yesterday
i
will
get
this
again
and
pair
with
some
chocolate
cake
or
something
similar
for
a
desert
a
beautiful
beer
looks
and
taste
easily
one
of
if
not
my
most
favorite
belgian
style
beer
truly
a
pleasure
this
beer
tastes
like
cough
medicine
dont
understand
its
high
rating
tastes
very
much
like
wine
with
a
little
beer
fizz
at
the
end
after
the
syrupy
mess
that
was
big
lushuous
i
was
a
little
worried
this
would
end
up
the
same
and
though
while
the
raspberry
is
sweet
it
is
natural
balanced
serving
type
bottle
never
given
a
perfect
score
and
never
thought
it
would
be
a
fruit
beer
either
just
an
absolutely
incredible
drink
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
flavored
beers
but
this
one
may
change
my
mind
other
flavored
beers
i
have
had
overdo
the
sweetness
making
it
hard
to
drink
much
this
one
tones
that
down
making
for
something
different
if
you
want
something
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
give
this
a
try
this
is
a
very
tasty
fruit
beer
great
for
a
desert
beer
lots
of
raspberry
too
much
for
my
taste
my
gf
and
i
like
mixing
a
framboise
with
hoegaarden
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
good
for
that
unfortunately
its
expense
would
indicate
thats
not
what
its
meant
for
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
refreshing
not
too
sweet
i
feel
this
could
be
so
much
more
its
delish
but
for
me
the
alcohol
heat
was
distracting
overall
a
really
great
imperial
fruit
beer
its
like
rubaeus
on
steroids
huge
taste
of
raspberries
with
a
nice
presence
of
belgian
yeast
it
avoids
becoming
too
sweet
or
boozy
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
after
missing
it
in
2011
going
to
age
a
few
and
see
how
it
holds
up
very
powerful
flavor
so
take
it
slow
overall
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
after
an
almost
5
year
hiatus
the
raspberries
are
prominent
and
delicious
while
the
belgian
base
ale
makes
its
presence
known
as
well
i
cannot
wait
to
see
where
this
will
go
with
age
if
only
i
can
manage
to
not
drink
my
other
bottles
edit
i
just
wanted
to
add
that
the
lacing
wasnt
too
impressive
didnt
stay
for
long
or
stick
to
the
glass
much
at
all
o
a
good
beer
that
im
glad
they
brewed
again
as
i
missed
it
the
first
time
but
i
have
to
say
i
dont
find
it
all
that
much
different
than
rubaeus
but
it
is
twice
as
expensive
yes
the
belgian
yeast
adds
a
bit
of
depth
to
it
but
really
not
that
much
compared
to
regular
it
is
much
better
than
any
of
the
cheap
belgian
fruit
wit
beers
ive
had
my
final
thought
on
this
is
that
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
that
much
different
than
rubaeus
which
is
also
a
very
good
beer
and
much
cheaper
and
easier
to
get
all
summer
not
sure
exactly
what
all
the
hype
about
this
one
is
about
maybe
the
2011
release
was
better
i
think
i
prefer
the
lightness
of
rubaeus
over
this
its
still
decent
for
what
it
is
if
raspberries
are
your
thing
get
this
beer
a
little
one
dimensional
but
tasty
a
great
fruit
brew
reminds
me
of
new
glarus
in
the
same
vein
very
memorable
i
hope
they
make
it
every
year
this
had
a
weird
medicinal
taste
for
me
it
was
almost
like
drinking
cough
syrup
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
i
would
not
drink
it
everyday
but
it
is
a
wonderful
change
of
pace
this
is
an
indulgence
for
fans
of
beers
infused
with
fruit
liquified
raspberry
halls
cough
drops
one
of
the
best
fruitveg
beers
i
have
ever
had
excellent
deep
red
color
and
intense
raspberry
flavor
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
thus
far
in
2015
o
promising
but
for
the
price
this
bottle
was
a
letdown
if
that
bitter
note
wasnt
there
and
the
fruitwheat
kept
the
stage
i
would
be
scoring
this
a
lot
higher
without
the
bitter
note
it
would
go
from
very
good
to
perfect
if
there
was
a
bit
of
acidity
to
complement
the
sweetness
outlier
detected
for
the
price
tag
this
beer
should
be
amazing
it
just
awful
i
hate
founders
and
this
was
the
final
straw
i
will
never
spend
another
penny
on
their
overhyped
crap
products
o
yes
this
is
awesome
and
worth
the
price
looks
like
founders
made
a
large
amount
of
it
so
i
hope
many
get
the
chance
to
try
it
raspberry
jam
in
a
bottle
really
sweet
but
not
cloying
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
well
worth
looking
for
it
while
overpriced
and
missing
that
tart
flavor
to
counter
the
sweetness
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
has
a
smooth
and
thick
mouthfeel
to
be
enjoyed
after
dinner
balance
the
sweetness
a
bit
more
and
youve
got
an
excellent

not

i

liked
it
taste
is
a
sweet
raspberry
sorbet
nicely
balanced
without
being
overwhelmingly
sweet
notes
of

and

would
pair
perfectly
with
vanilla

ice

if
you
love

i
do
this
is

huge

to
it
the
flavor
is

flavor

finishes
quite
dry
with
a
lingering
berry
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
light

its
hard
to
find
a
beer
in
here
overwhelming
raspberry
aroma
color

flavor
with
a
hint
of
belgian
yeastiness
is
this
founders
counter
to
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
tasty
sweet
syrupy
very
desert
like
i
was
excited
but
a
little
apprehensive
about
this
ale
after
my
disappointing
experience
with
big
lucious
when
i
opened
the
bottle
it
smelled
great
sweet
just
like
raspberries
it
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
minimal
head
then
the
first
taste
light
delcious
and
full
of
real
raspberry
taste
unlike
my
lucious
experience
no
crazy
bitter
after
taste
and
was
truly
a
delight
for
my
tastebuds
i
would
most
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
loves
a
raspberry
ale
one
thing
i
really
like
is
that
even
though
its
got
a
high
abv
9
2
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
i
thank
my
way
2
drunk
friend
for
gifting
this
to
me
he
got
it
right
o
i
would
definitely
choose
to
drink
this
over
rubaeus
any
day
i
dont
really
like
rubaeus
pretty
much
met
my
expectations
and
is
very
good
though
i
dont
see
where
all
the
hype
is
coming
from
its
basically
an
imperial
framboise
which
is
nice
but
not
really
earthshattering
overall
yes
please
i
want
another
bottle
to
age
6th
of
the
evening
imperial
rubeaus
sounds
about
right
not
getting
the
belgian
part
very
much
but
more
like
a
frambois
than
anything
great
and
refreshing
looks
like
another
michigan
favorite
faygo
redpop
this
is
a
tasty
fruit
drink
but
i
dont
quite
see
why
the
hoopla
surrounds
it
if
you
live
in
wisconsin
or
border
it
you
have
access
to
ng
raspberry
tart
for
about
half
the
cost
of
this
one
and
it
is
superior
in
every
way
except
for
its
alcohol
content
i
was
hoping
to
taste
more
belgian
yeasty
goodness
this
tasted
almost
only
like
raspberries
to
me
with
no
complex
flavors
that
i
wanted
to
get
in
a
belgian
fruit
beer
worth
trying
wish
i
couldve
got
a
sample
pour
before
spending
16
on
a
bottle
probably
wont
buy
again
for
what
it
is
i
guess
its
alright
but
damn
i
really
wish
founders
would
just
lay
off
the
raspberries
bc
everything
they
make
with
rasoberries
is
just
sickeningly
sweet
im
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
its
not
the
best
raspberry
beer
ive
ever
had
what
up
lpf
and
raspberry
tart
but
this
still
one
of
the
most
authentically
fruit
forward
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
this
beer
is
easily
liked
if
you
like
raspberries
and
crave
chocolate
like
i
do
overall
amazing
beer
strange
that
this
is
in
fact
a
beer
no
sign
of
9
2
abv
anywhere
very
good
met
my
expectations
would
recommend
highly
not
a
fan
way
too
sweet
thick
syrupy
very
much
like
childrens
cough
medicine
overall
founders
describes
this
as
imperial
rübæus
and
that
basically
hits
the
nail
right
on
the
head
not
super
complex
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
a
big
ass
raspberry
beer
and
its
done
well
overall
this
beer
is
a
perfect
dessert
beer
i
would
take
this
over
raspberry
tart
from
new
glarus
and
that
is
saying
something
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
but
that
is
just
a
curiosity
this
is
perfect
now
share
it
with
people
you
love
good
beer
but
way
too
sweet
for
my
taste
initial
thoughts
a
refined
more
sophisticated
rubaeus
heavy
raspberry
flavor
but
offers
a
better
balance
of
fruit
and
yeast
in
the
world
of
fruit
ales
this
is
an
absolute
standout
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
and
certainly
creeps
up
on
you
quickly
though
overall
this
is
your
perfect
dessert
beer
the
usage
of
raspberry
is
one
of
the
truest
most
genuine
efforts
weve
ever
encountered
sweetness
comes
crushingly
across
the
palate
wiping
most
other
things
away
do
not
expect
anything
sour
or
tart
out
of
this
guy
aside
from
the
natural
bite
and
pucker
of
the
fruit
itself
the
only
thing
that
could
catapult
this
to
the
next
level
would
be
if
they
would
barrel
aged
it
or
deepen
it
with
a
darker
more
chocolatey
malt
bill
that
would
be
just
craziness
though
so
ignore
that
it
is
superb
as
is
dont
get
us
wrong
as
a
bit
of
commentary
we
find
it
entertaining
that
we
our
only
now
getting
to
try
the
2011
effort
as
they
ramp
up
to
rerelease
blushing
monk
next
month
in
march
of
2015
we
should
have
waited
to
do
a
sidebyside
but
something
tells
me
the
memory
of
this
beer
wont
soon
fade
from
our
minds
possibly
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
where
the
fruit
is
the
sole
star
this
beer
is
all
about
jammy
raspberries
its
not
funky
or
sour
theres
an
inherent
tartness
because
fresh
raspberries
are
tart
by
nature
id
love
to
pair
this
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
for
dessert
truly
remarkable
cost
12
99
for
a
750
ml
bottle
as
far
as
raspberry
fruit
beers
go
this
is
a
couple
notches
above
raspberry
tart
i
thought
raspberry
tart
was
too
sweet
but
blushing
monk
is
ridiculously
fruity
without
that
overwhelming
sweetness
of
raspberry
tart
its
basically
a
steroidal
raspberry
fruit
beer
and
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
raspberries
this
beer
has
held
up
unbelievably
well
i
am
very
impressed
and
this
certainly
exceeded
my
expectations
nothing
at
all
like
rubaeus
this
beer
feels
as
authentically
fruity
as
new
glarus
fruit
beers
do
very
much
worth
seeking
out
again
trying
a
2015
bottle
now
and
either
my
palate
has
changed
or
something
is
different
here
likely
the
former
in
any
case
not
as
rich
and
decadent
as
i
remember
and
much
more
sweet
and
cloying
syrup
decent
enough
for
a
few
ounces
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
raspberries
but
beyond
that
its
just
a
bit
much
pretty
big
score
downgrade
here
overall
not
bad
its
def
plenty
of
awesome
raspberry
a
bit
too
sweet
and
syrupy
but
not
overly
light
stem
seed
like
tannins
and
touch
of
bitterness
somehow
drinkable
despite
the
crazy
syrupy
sweetness
but
tasty
overall
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
wish
i
could
have
tried
this
fresh
so
i
had
a
point
of
comparison
but
man
was
this
delicious
o
this
is
very
reminiscent
of
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
but
slightly
less
sweet
which
is
a
good
thing
theres
not
really
much
to
the
beer
besides
the
raspberry
flavor
the
taste
has
great
raspberry
cordial
type
flavor
with
a
slight
malt
sweetness
and
tanginess
of
fruit
with
slight
sweetness
and
gently
tart
flavor
in
the
finish
with
semisweet
but
not
quite
candylike
raspberry
taste
very
natural
in
intensity
overall
this
is
an
excellent
fruit
beer
with
enough
strength
that
is
in
the
realm
of
some
strong
ales
the
fruit
seems
to
cloak
the
alcohol
making
this
a
drinkable
deceptive
beer
founders
never
disappoints
absolutely
delicious
im
glad
i
got
to
have
this
at
a
tasting
because
it
is
a
very
bold
beer
but
my
glass
was
amazing
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
this
amount
of
fruit
craziness
is
what
some
might
expect
all
fruit
beers
to
be
like
but
dare
i
say
this
reaches
a
bit
beyond
the
spectrum
of
even
feeling
like
a
beer
those
who
enjoy
the
likes
of
dessert
beer
or
new
glarus
or
selinsgrove
fruit
beers
will
probably
go
bonkers
for
this
a
real
panty
dropper
per
se
overall
world
class
for
style
great
raspberry
flavor
with
enough
tartness
and
complexity
to
keep
it
inviting
even
at
750
ml
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
almost
seems
like
it
should
be
healthy
with
all
the
berry
juice
but
i
doubt
thats
really
the
case
great
stuff
nonetheless
overall
fantastic
raspberry
beer
good
drinkability
could
have
a
lot
of
this
d
very
drinkable
big
raspberry
and
fruity
flavor
but
there
is
also
many
other
subtle
flavors
to
add
some
complexity
and
balance
i
bet
this
is
a
big
panty
dropper
women
would
definitely
love
this
too
think
i
may
crack
open
a
bottle
with
some
italian
ice
and
share
with
my
wife
look
out
sheets
delicious
beer
that
seems
to
hit
a
great
stride
around
the
year
mark
loads
of
fresh
raspberries
mixing
with
the
malt
to
create
a
raspberry
tart
in
a
glass
mildly
acidic
bringing
a
pleasant
tartness
to
help
balance
all
the
sweetness
ultimately
drinking
this
beer
is
a
bittersweet
experience
literally
and
figuratively
simply
its
a
wonder
resplendent
multifaceted
sweet
dense
slightly
sour
and
impeccably
executed
the
problem
is
the
loomingcrushing
doubt
that
i
will
ever
get
the
chance
to
drink
it
again
i
feel
as
though
sharon
van
ettens
crushing
ode
heart
in
the
ground
would
not
be
out
of
place
playing
over
the
stereo
as
i
joyfully
and
ruefully
finish
this
glass
can
i
live
without
you
seems
like
a
nearly
applicable
sentiment
overall
compared
to
other
raspberry
hybrids
this
is
vastly
different
like
a
milky
lactic
smoothie
more
than
the
refreshing
dry
tartness
maybe
the
belgian
influence
though
i
didnt
get
it
much
in
the
flavor
demarcates
itself
from
the
pack
and
very
unique
this
has
a
great
raspberry
flavor
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
preference
but
its
hard
to
deny
the
quality
that
is
put
into
this
beverage
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
pretty
fantastic
real
enjoyable
o
very
well
done
fruit
beer
that
was
solid
all
around
and
was
glad
to
try
good
job
founders
its
shocking
how
much
i
ended
up
loving
this
beer
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
thought
it
would
be
too
sweet
or
too
thick
blushing
monk
exceeds
all
expectations
except
mouthfeel
but
even
then
the
lack
of
booze
is
all
the
more
inviting
raspberries
if
one
word
reviews
were
allowed
that
might
be
all
i
would
say
i
never
give
a
5
for
appearance
but
i
have
to
give
love
to
a
beer
that
is
movie
scene
bloodred
while
pouring
from
the
bottle
one
gets
a
big
nose
of
raspberries
the
initial
taste
is
raspberries
one
really
get
the
tart
of
the
raspberries
and
can
almost
sense
the
skin
of
the
fruit
on
your
tongue
if
i
did
not
know
it
was
a
beer
i
might
have
trouble
recognizing
it
there
really
are
not
many
of
the
elements
of
beer
present
there
is
not
much
carbonation
or
maltiness
one
might
get
a
hint
of
wheat
in
this
respect
it
reminds
me
of
the
new
glarus
belgians
however
i
still
detect
beer
in
the
new
glarus
line
the
tart
raspberry
continues
into
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
onedimensional
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
i
thought
id
never
get
to
try
this
again
after
blowing
through
the
bottle
i
had
glad
this
showed
up
at
the
festival
im
not
a
particular
fan
of
either
belgians
ir
fruity
beer
but
this
stuff
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
well
done
founders
it
is
my
opinion
that
with
time
the
malts
will
shine
more
making
it
a
delightful
brew
especially
because
i
am
fan
of
malty
beers
and
raspberries
both
and
although
i
remarked
that
it
is
rather
syrupy
and
tough
to
drink
at
the
moment
it
still
drinks
very
easy
for
its
body
and
abv
o
overall
this
is
incredibly
outstanding
so
so
so
much
raspberry
its
incredible
just
how
much
raspberry
qualities
theyve
crammed
into
this
one
o
it
isnt
bad
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
it
but
got
it
for
my
gf
the
smell
and
taste
are
tart
then
sweet
raspberries
the
whole
time
i
tried
to
find
another
scent
or
flavor
but
couldnt
for
what
it
is
its
great
but
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
then
one
bottle
of
this
in
a
row
i
will
say
it
is
better
then
some
raspberry
stouts
and
other
flavored
beer
i
have
tried
blushing
monk
is
amusing
for
three
sips
anything
beyond
that
is
overkill
o
while
it
is
a
touch
too
sweet
it
is
nowhere
near
lindemans
framboise
sweet
and
is
a
very
nice
raspberry
beer
good
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
quite
good
never
thought
i
would
rank
a
fruit
beer
so
high
poured
from
750ml
2011
vintage
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
slightly
viscous
deep
blood
red
with
a
creamy
pink
head
nose
is
raspberries
raspberries
and
raspberries
along
with
some
sweet
tarts
and
strawberry
funk
flavor
is
again
all
raspberries
very
sweet
juicy
puckering
sweet
and
tarty
finishes
medium
bodied
and
only
lightly
sweet
really
enjoyed
this
fruit
beer
from
founders
have
to
say
the
appearance
took
me
by
surprise
wouldve
loved
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
wisconsins
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
even
though
i
am
not
big
on
sours
or
fruitvegetable
beers
except
pumpkin
o
i
really
wanted
to
give
this
a
3
75
but
i
rounded
up
it
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
it
is
awfully
sweet
once
you
start
drinking
enough
of
it
i
think
splitting
this
bottle
would
have
been
a
wise
choice
the
sweetness
just
got
to
me
after
a
while
and
i
have
quite
the
sweet
tooth
cheers
o
solid
beer
but
it
was
better
when
i
had
it
on
tap
at
founders
i
started
off
thinking
that
my
glass
was
not
enough
but
the
drinkability
diminishes
as
i
have
more
than
8
ounces
its
trite
but
this
is
now
a
different
beer
as
the
raspberry
diminishes
still
awesome
o
im
glad
i
have
one
more
bottle
to
enjoy
with
my
sisterinlaw
for
easter
2012
4
5
overall
is
from
ease
of
obtainment
o
an
interesting
beer
i
was
surprised
as
how
easy
it
was
to
drink
and
the
unique
aromas
but
not
something
i
would
crave
constantly
especially
at
this
price
point
drinkability
highly
drinkable
the
only
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
is
the
touch
of
red
wine
body
is
mediumfull
bigger
than
i
expected
with
good
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
not
too
fizzy
feels
just
about
right
with
a
bit
of
heft
to
it
heres
hoping
they
bring
this
one
back
again
soon
oan
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
which
i
enjoyed
for
dessert
but
would
not
drink
much
on
a
regular
basis
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
color
slightly
hazy
with
little
head
it
smells
and
tastes
like
fresh
raspberries
there
is
not
much
beer
flavor
here
but
there
is
a
fair
bit
of
belgian
yeast
that
contributes
an
identifiable
spicy
ester
and
phenolic
profile
one
gets
from
pale
belgian
ales
the
beer
is
very
sweet
at
least
the
perception
of
sweetness
is
there
from
the
berries
but
there
is
a
nice
tartness
to
balance
it
out
it
has
a
fresher
fruit
taste
than
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
but
i
find
it
sweeter
more
aggressive
than
that
beer
which
i
enjoy
a
bit
more
o
so
darn
good
not
cloying
or
overly
tart
not
artificial
at
all
really
drinkable
as
well
would
love
to
find
another
bottle
of
this
o
i
have
to
go
with
an
a
grade
on
this
one
i
cant
believe
that
i
am
rating
it
that
high
but
for
the
style
and
the
amount
of
clean
flavor
that
i
got
i
really
liked
it
backed
the
wifes
review
up
the
only
raspberry
beer
that
ive
encountered
that
tops
this
is
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
however
this
is
a
little
hard
to
compare
its
very
unique
its
very
sweet
but
it
also
has
a
nice
malt
profile
blushing
monk
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
pure
raspberry
syrup
its
very
sweet
i
definitely
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
maybe
ill
put
the
rest
on
some
waffles
or
ice
cream
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
reddishpurple
with
a
thin
pink
head
smell
is
sugary
raspberries
with
some
belgian
yeast
lurking
in
the
background
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
however
the
raspberry
flavor
is
excellent
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
heavy
and
boozy
for
my
taste
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
think
it
tastes
more
like
a
raspberry
liqueur
than
a
beer
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
heavier
than
i
would
have
imagined
and
fairly
sticky
its
a
nice
fruit
beer
but
i
would
prefer
something
a
little
lighter
and
not
quite
as
sweet
maybe
drinking
fruit
lambic
over
the
last
few
years
has
spoiled
me
but
this
is
so
opposite
of
that
style
that
my
palate
is
somewhat
jarred
overall
good
but
nothing
too
particularly
special
pours
a
goregous
dark
ruby
color
with
a
small
purple
pink
head
kinda
looks
like
a
weird
red
wine
this
smells
like
raspberry
candy
and
raspberry
syrup
this
tastes
amazing
tastes
like
sweet
candy
and
rasperrby
other
dark
fruity
flavors
are
there
too
slightly
drying
but
also
sweet
feel
is
lightly
tingly
yum
so
drinkable
o
such
an
amazing
crowdpleasing
beer
that
pairs
phenomenally
well
with
desserts
founders
should
get
rid
of
cerise
and
add
this
to
their
fulltime
lineup
i
brought
this
beer
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
a
nye
party
for
mimosas
no
one
seemed
interested
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
o
an
amazing
fruit
beer
hands
down
this
is
the
most
raspberry
forward
beer
ive
ever
had
o
a
good
beer
dont
know
if
its
a
belgian
strong
pale
or
not
but
its
good
o
darn
good
stuff
from
founders
once
again
a
bit
sweet
initially
but
i
like
the
way
that
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
funky
middle
and
tart
crisp
and
dry
finish
a
really
good
beer
overall
i
will
enjoy
seeing
how
this
ages
o
great
fruit
beer
might
be
the
best
one
ive
ever
tried
its
not
like
fruit
soda
like
some
and
its
not
like
others
where
the
fruit
characteristics
are
buried
moreys
bottom
line
ive
been
sitting
on
this
for
a
while
now
and
decided
that
today
was
a
good
day
to
crack
it
open
very
rich
and
tart
raspberry
beer
fun
and
unique
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
this
is
your
huckleberry
pours
a
vibrant
red
color
with
a
pinkish
short
livid
head
aroma
of
cherry
other
assorted
berries
and
belgian
yeast
in
the
taste
tart
raspberry
puree
cherry
and
cranberry
juice
elements
a
mild
tartness
is
noticeable
alcohol
is
muted
tastes
fruity
semisweet
but
very
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
overall
a
tasty
brew
almost
like
a
lambic
but
not
quite
there
nor
is
it
trying
to
be
an
enjoyable
brew
but
not
one
id
buy
again
o
for
a
style
that
is
growing
on
me
this
beer
is
definetely
tops
this
should
be
a
must
try
on
anyones
list
who
enjoys
or
is
looking
to
explore
fruit
beers
dark
blood
red
modest
amount
of
pink
head
no
surprise
its
full
on
raspberries
here
slightly
tart
and
very
earthy
flavor
is
loaded
with
raspberry
puree
very
vinous
as
if
they
threw
all
the
branches
and
leaves
in
the
slurry
dry
finish
mild
carbonation
not
even
in
the
same
class
as
raspberry
tart
o
enjoyed
this
start
to
finish
obviously
not
for
anyone
who
doesnt
like
raspberry
or
fruit
beer
in
general
this
is
outstanding
for
the
style
id
love
it
if
founders
made
this
a
yearly
release
o
i
dont
have
the
heat
to
give
this
brew
a
poor
rating
just
because
it
misses
the
style
so
poorly
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
fruit
brew
please
dont
be
deceived
not
too
much
belgian
going
on
with
this
brew
highly
recommended
i
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
happens
to
this
brew
with
a
little
age
blushing
monk
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
am
very
happy
to
see
once
again
certainly
not
an
every
day
drinker
this
is
one
you
want
to
keep
on
hand
for
a
special
occasion
the
flavor
is
rich
and
decadent
certainly
a
sipper
founders
delivers
far
more
than
a
simple
fruit
beer
even
if
you
are
not
normally
a
fan
of
the
style
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
one
out
this
beer
pours
a
dark
rose
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
tart
like
unripe
rasberries
the
taste
is
very
fruity
but
with
enough
malt
and
carbonation
that
you
still
know
that
youre
drinking
beer
i
didnt
pick
up
much
of
a
belgian
yeast
flavor
or
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
i
definitely
wouldnt
have
known
this
was
a
9
2abv
beer
if
it
didnt
say
so
on
the
bottle
this
was
proably
the
most
enjoyable
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
although
for
the
price
26
in
philly
i
dont
know
if
this
is
something
id
consistently
purchase
were
it
not
a
seasonal
release
overall
i
was
intrigued
by
this
beer
from
the
moment
i
heard
about
it
so
i
was
thrilled
that
they
decided
to
remake
it
and
bottle
it
at
this
point
in
terms
of
raspberry
beers
it
only
comes
short
of
the
great
raspberry
sours
in
my
mind
totally
different
than
when
it
was
fresh
overall
this
one
was
thoroughly
enjoyed
by
both
my
wife
who
generally
enjoys
red
wine
and
sweeter
cocktails
over
beer
and
myself
i
tend
to
like
stronger
malt
bombs
as
well
as
the
ipa
family
if
this
one
were
available
year
round
wed
always
have
some
onhand
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
pretty
good
if
youre
a
fan
of
raspberries
and
i
am
this
is
like
drinking
spiked
raspberry
punch
strange
beer
great
flavors
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
looks
good
smells
good
but
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
to
really
enjoy
doverall
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
a
long
time
im
so
glad
i
grabbed
5
bottles
of
this
this
goes
especially
well
with
thanksgiving
if
you
have
not
tried
this
please
do
try
to
get
it
i
just
love
the
intense
flavors
of
raspberry
this
is
so
drinkable
and
complex
at
the
same
time
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
perfect
blend
of
sweet
fruitiness
and
tart
sourness
overall
this
one
is
tied
between
excellent
and
amazing
nuff
said
2015
vintage
is
sub
par
utterly
disappointed
in
this
brew
they
changed
the
recipe
and
not
a
fan
pours
a
clear
dark
crimson
with
a
1
inch
puffy
light
red
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
chunky
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
a
very
striking
looking
beer
smell
is
of
raspberries
raspberry
juice
other
berries
and
some
malt
notes
taste
is
of
raspberries
and
other
berries
berry
juices
and
a
subtle
malt
flavor
that
ties
everything
together
some
tanninlike
aspects
in
the
flavors
this
beer
has
a
very
winelike
mouthfeel
with
a
coating
quality
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
the
beer
is
dry
on
the
drink
down
overall
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
with
a
nice
raspberryberry
presence
i
think
the
smell
on
this
one
is
better
than
the
taste
though
d
a
really
solid
fruit
beer
though
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
is
heavy
and
sweet
but
lots
of
great
fruit
in
here
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
it
after
a
few
years
simply
based
upon
how
that
small
taste
of
the
original
bottling
was
like
o
as
straight
forward
as
this
beer
was
it
was
pretty
damn
tasty
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
with
some
nice
berry
tartness
at
the
end
my
favorite
fruit
ale
ive
had
to
date
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
deep
red
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
carbonation
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
freshly
pressed
raspberry
with
light
sweet
note
is
quite
incredible
and
close
to
the
new
glarus
beers
in
terms
of
aroma
taste
is
also
a
super
good
mix
dominated
by
loads
of
pressed
raspberry
with
light
tart
notes
and
a
well
balanced
sweetness
level
malt
backbone
can
be
felt
though
doesnt
play
a
huge
role
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
wasnt
expecting
this
much
from
a
fruit
beer
and
couldnt
understand
the
hype
i
know
do
bottle
popped
open
a
bottle
by
my
lonesome
tonight
as
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
one
and
it
sitting
in
my
fridge
was
way
too
much
a
temptation
on
a
friday
night
pours
an
extremely
dark
rosie
red
color
with
a
deep
reddish
pink
head
hmm
ever
so
slight
belgian
yeast
esters
upfront
that
then
gets
dominated
by
a
hard
core
raspberry
aroma
i
have
a
feeling
on
this
one
that
the
taste
is
going
to
follow
the
nose
raspberry
raspberry
and
a
touch
of
additional
raspberry
head
settles
to
form
a
pink
collar
around
the
glass
as
with
the
nose
their
is
a
slight
belgian
flare
to
this
that
quickly
transitions
to
a
full
frontal
assault
of
raspberry
flavor
tart
and
sweet
slight
bitter
in
the
end
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
like
it
just
ate
something
really
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
i
need
to
try
this
next
to
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
to
see
which
i
like
better
but
this
is
really
good
as
a
sweet
fruity
beer
overall
a
very
tasty
raspberry
beer
i
think
it
could
improve
with
time
and
that
other
flavorsaromas
may
come
forward
once
the
raspberry
fades
a
bit
m
medium
body
smooth
light
carbonation
thumbs
up
this
easily
gets
my
recommendation
do
barely
appearing
as
beer
the
blushing
monk
channels
real
raspberry
qualities
in
a
deceptively
strong
package
even
among
fruit
beers
it
stands
apart
allowing
the
fruit
to
take
over
instead
of
making
a
place
for
it
amidst
other
beer
characteristics
still
it
is
compelling
drinkable
and
a
success
mouthfeel
it
love
how
this
beer
goes
down
for
a
belgianlambic
it
isnt
to
tart
to
drink
and
everything
about
it
screams
freshness
this
beer
is
just
as
good
as
its
new
glarus
cousins
maybe
better
will
do
a
side
by
side
someday
to
see
if
i
am
right
excellent
beer
i
hate
to
pick
nits
especially
after
having
done
it
real
life
but
id
take
either
of
the
new
glarus
beers
over
this
lower
alcohol
more
depth
better
tasting
but
now
im
just
whining
because
well
yummy
o
this
is
an
amazingly
jammy
onedimensional
fruit
beer
and
nothing
more
o
i
think
this
had
lived
up
to
the
hype
it
takes
a
lot
of
work
to
keep
the
fresh
taste
and
not
let
it
get
to
preserve
tasting
a
flavorful
fruit
beer
this
is
not
a
belgian
pale
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
nice
fruit
beer
very
real
not
that
fake
fruit
extract
that
is
typically
found
in
most
fruit
beers
nice
sweet
dessert
beer
to
share
i
was
really
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
was
glowingly
sweet
and
the
fruit
flavor
was
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
and
i
just
could
not
enjoy
it
at
all
there
was
little
to
no
head
on
this
beer
and
the
carbonation
was
severely
lacking
im
not
sure
what
the
hype
is
about
i
like
founders
but
this
one
was
a
miss
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
am
not
one
usually
into
fruit
beers
but
this
is
one
i
would
go
to
great
lengths
for
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
recommend
sharing
a
big
bottle
with
friends
as
a
dessert
o
very
good
to
drink
with
the
wife
its
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
an
entire
bottle
by
myself
i
did
enjoy
the
fact
that
it
was
more
tart
and
sour
then
sweet
thanks
to
jdiddy
for
pulling
this
out
of
the
cellar
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
chalice
2006
vintage
pours
a
brilliant
translucent
claret
hue
with
no
head
big
raspberry
aromas
as
well
as
a
slight
earthy
character
i
cannot
express
how
much
raspberry
you
get
off
the
nose
taste
is
fantastic
raspberry
dominates
but
theres
also
an
easy
pleasant
tartness
some
acidity
and
a
slightly
medicinal
quality
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
crisp
carbonation
this
is
an
amazing
and
dangerously
drinkable
beer
the
earlier
vintage
weighed
in
at
12
6
having
tried
the
2011
vintage
immediately
following
i
have
to
say
that
age
has
done
some
wonderful
things
to
this
brew
if
you
can
pick
up
a
couple
bottles
definitely
cellar
one
for
several
years
a
delicious
raspberry
ale
that
truly
allows
the
authentic
fresh
and
vibrant
flavor
of
the
fruit
to
shine
through
quite
tremendous
when
its
cold
straight
from
the
tap
its
a
bit
prickly
in
the
mouth
and
a
little
overbearing
in
flavor
as
it
warms
a
bit
everything
tends
to
mellow
out
and
its
quite
enjoyable
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
that
this
would
be
too
sweet
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
not
too
sweet
at
all
not
something
id
want
to
drink
everyday
but
overall
a
good
beer
this
brew
poured
out
looking
like
carbonated
blood
a
really
nice
looking
ruby
red
brew
with
a
pink
colored
creamy
looking
head
no
lacing
but
has
some
light
retention
the
smell
is
of
fresh
raspberries
and
more
raspberries
the
taste
is
sweet
and
lightly
tart
with
again
with
plenty
of
raspberries
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slick
overall
this
brew
is
a
lot
like
most
framboise
brews
very
sweet
and
has
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
definitely
somethingto
sip
and
enjoy
over
a
long
period
of
time
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
finally
pours
a
deep
purple
sort
of
like
a
red
wine
color
with
a
one
finger
pinkish
purple
head
the
head
recedes
to
skim
and
leaves
gobs
of
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
has
the
scent
of
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
raspberry
taste
and
then
midway
through
switches
to
a
raspberry
tartiness
with
a
hint
of
booze
the
beer
was
very
sweet
in
nature
the
mouthfeel
was
cabonated
and
silky
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
good
taste
look
and
aroma
a
very
easy
drink
despite
decent
abv
o
nice
treat
and
an
interesting
beer
is
a
great
beer
to
have
in
a
bottle
share
since
its
so
unique
and
very
tasty
waited
to
post
this
due
to
the
first
bottle
had
some
leakage
in
transit
for
the
trade
and
was
therefore
pretty
flat
no
fault
of
the
brewer
still
got
a
lot
of
the
flavors
that
way
but
man
the
carbonated
version
was
sooo
much
better
less
sweet
more
tart
creamy
fluffy
and
fruits
notes
were
delicious
o
well
done
the
abv
is
really
well
hidden
good
drinkability
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
lot
of
it
although
this
was
a
last
minute
trade
im
happy
i
tried
it
its
quite
tasty
and
not
just
another
gushy
fruit
beer
i
cant
be
sure
how
much
was
paid
for
this
beer
but
anything
around
12
would
be
reasonable
i
do
wish
that
more
of
the
belgian
characteristics
same
through
a
yeast
fruitiness
would
have
played
nicely
off
the
raspberries
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
like
an
adult
soda
i
could
probably
down
the
entire
750
ml
in
15
minutes
with
a
straw
if
i
were
really
so
inclined
the
body
is
a
little
thick
with
an
almost
syrupy
quality
to
it
but
is
not
sticky
or
difficult
to
swallow
the
carbonation
is
slightly
fizzy
but
is
obviously
helping
to
prevent
the
body
from
congealing
overall
this
beer
has
a
very
slick
mouthfeel
and
it
just
slides
over
your
tongue
and
down
your
throat
and
once
again
founders
makes
one
hell
of
a
beer
pours
a
winelike
deep
ruby
with
some
dark
pink
foam
that
disappears
rather
quickly
to
a
ring
and
some
large
bubbles
smells
vegetal
and
loads
of
raspberries
taste
is
again
loads
of
raspberries
and
some
cherry
with
a
pleasant
moderate
tartness
thickens
the
saliva
full
bodied
and
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
suffers
a
little
on
the
drinkability
due
to
the
heavy
dose
of
raspberry
and
the
syrupy
body
that
being
said
i
generally
find
fruit
beers
like
the
ng
ones
to
be
drinkable
only
in
very
small
doses
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this
beer
i
have
always
loved
lambic
fruit
style
beers
first
off
the
beer
pours
a
deep
red
as
expected
a
quickly
disappearing
pink
head
it
was
a
bit
more
sour
than
i
expected
in
taste
both
on
draft
and
in
bottle
still
a
great
beer
worthy
of
the
founders
label
i
would
say
its
very
close
to
the
ras
tart
from
new
glaris
but
with
a
heavier
mouthfeel
and
overall
weight
i
would
however
rather
have
a
new
glaris
belg
red
over
either
one
of
these
beers
i
look
forward
to
pulling
another
one
out
of
the
cellar
around
the
holidays
to
see
how
this
one
continues
to
evolve
o
one
word
unique
i
liked
it
not
a
beer
i
would
have
often
but
once
or
twice
a
year
would
be
great
i
just
love
how
beers
continue
to
transform
and
i
hope
that
never
stops
i
do
think
blushing
monk
is
going
to
age
nicely
i
expect
the
tartness
will
fade
somewhat
and
the
hops
will
die
turning
this
into
an
even
sweeter
dessert
like
beer
now
i
just
have
to
find
some
bottles
for
the
cellar
o
just
pure
concentrated
fruit
and
definitely
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
better
even
than
ng
beers
thanks
again
jay
i
would
love
to
drink
another
bottle
of
this
a
very
good
fruit
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
it
better
if
there
was
just
a
touch
more
tartness
ill
choose
ng
raspberry
tart
over
this
pours
a
deep
dark
blood
red
with
a
massive
dark
pink
frothy
head
nice
retention
and
light
clumps
of
lacing
aroma
is
pure
sugary
natural
cranberry
and
raspberry
puree
fruit
flavor
is
straight
tart
raspberry
puree
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
which
was
probably
picking
up
some
of
the
belgian
yeast
which
is
overpowered
here
slightly
drying
in
the
finish
medium
thick
body
with
low
carbonation
it
is
what
it
is
raspberry
puree
with
light
alcohol
presence
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
fruit
beer
even
though
i
am
typically
not
a
fan
of
how
sweet
fruit
beers
are
hopefully
founders
will
bottle
this
one
again
cracked
this
with
pixieskid
yesterday
toward
the
end
of
a
night
of
many
many
beers
it
is
a
very
dark
red
beer
with
a
cap
of
pinkish
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
huge
on
the
raspberries
with
a
mild
belgian
yeast
aroma
but
the
raspberries
were
the
big
star
here
with
the
flavor
as
well
there
was
a
lot
of
raspberry
with
a
bit
of
belgian
character
this
beer
is
to
raspberries
what
cerise
wishes
it
could
be
to
cherries
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
would
have
liked
which
maybe
leaves
it
a
bit
sweet
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
definitely
wish
i
had
been
able
to
pick
more
up
sixounce
pour
into
a
flute
glass
a
lush
rubycolored
beer
with
a
thick
magenta
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
nice
lacing
behind
aroma
thick
with
raspberries
like
lindemans
framboise
times
five
at
least
juicy
sweet
taste
raspberries
aplentyyou
can
almost
feel
the
grit
of
the
seeds
between
your
teethtart
sensations
on
the
tongue
grassy
with
subtle
hints
to
the
malt
and
yeast
at
play
in
the
distant
background
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
for
a
fruit
beer
founders
is
definitely
my
goto
brewer
if
im
in
the
rare
mood
for
a
raspberry
or
cherry
see
cerise
beer
this
is
a
great
fruit
beer
it
tastes
of
natural
raspberries
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
flavorful
a
great
example
of
what
a
fruit
beer
should
be
o
delicious
with
a
raw
natural
raspberry
flavor
o
im
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
beers
like
this
but
it
isnt
quite
as
cloying
as
some
others
overall
so
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
review
its
unique
i
opened
this
with
my
wife
thinking
shed
enjoy
it
she
took
one
sip
and
said
no
thanks
im
stuck
with
the
whole
bottle
hence
why
i
dont
think
its
easy
to
drink
and
why
exactly
is
this
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
how
is
this
not
a
fruit
beer
had
on
draft
at
capones
in
a
5
oz
snifter
pours
a
luscious
wine
red
no
head
to
speak
of
this
wreaks
of
raspberries
in
a
good
way
the
taste
is
very
complex
sweet
yet
tart
this
is
all
raspberry
all
the
time
5
oz
is
the
perfect
serving
size
for
this
definitely
a
sipper
i
find
myself
involuntarily
preventing
this
from
rolling
over
the
tip
of
my
tongue
oh
yeah
its
sour
considering
this
type
of
beer
isnt
really
my
bag
im
enjoying
this
would
have
again
o
good
flavors
just
so
so
sweet
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
bodied
creamy
with
a
fine
modest
carbonation
i
would
recommend
this
one
again
and
again
o
really
nice
beer
a
little
sweeter
than
i
prefer
but
this
beer
has
its
place
and
it
is
exceptional
in
its
place
great
for
a
warm
summer
evening
tastefullon
rasperries
tart
subtle
belgian
spiciness
almost
like
a
glass
of
fortified
wine
or
a
raspberry
lambic
that
being
said
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
that
hides
the
high9
2abv
very
well
if
there
are
any
hops
to
speak
of
in
this
belgian
strong
pale
ale
they
are
effectively
drowned
out
by
the
intense
raspberry
flavor
the
blushing
monk
would
make
an
outstanding
dessert
beer
either
on
its
own
or
with
anything
sweet
this
is
pretty
bad
the
fruit
flavor
seems
very
artificial
to
me
to
much
like
childerens
cough
syrup
i
love
founders
but
this
is
crap
not
something
i
would
recommend
an
excellent
fruit
beer
so
fruity
as
to
make
you
question
how
much
beer
is
here
and
how
much
of
this
is
simply
a
variation
on
very
welldone
raspberry
wine
im
so
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
and
am
looking
forward
to
grabbing
more
of
founders
backstage
series
oneoff
releases
this
year
a
very
flavorful
fruit
beer
maybe
too
much
fruit
for
a
beer
since
it
dominates
everything
o
phenomenal
beer
i
can
see
why
this
is
only
a
limited
release
though
they
had
to
use
every
raspberry
in
the
midwest
d
this
was
like
an
oud
bruin
with
tons
of
raspberries
added
to
the
barrel
fantastic
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
were
all
great
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
i
guess
the
original
batch
was
12
3
but
the
bottle
here
claims
9
2
either
way
it
drank
like
6
not
sure
how
itll
age
but
it
was
great
fresh
recommended
i
think
i
got
my
raspberry
fix
for
awhile
the
berry
is
put
on
display
and
not
much
else
gets
in
the
way
of
the
berry
drink
not
sludgy
but
not
super
light
either
bold
and
in
your
face
this
was
a
nice
bottle
it
was
as
i
mentioned
a
sipper
beer
and
fun
to
sit
and
watch
flavors
melt
together
and
mold
as
it
warmed
a
little
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
not
one
that
i
could
drink
everyday
but
am
definitely
glad
that
i
was
able
to
try
it
and
look
forward
to
having
my
other
bottle
in
the
spring
maybe
o
some
people
will
dislike
this
beer
but
mostly
the
sour
fiends
but
this
will
appeal
very
much
to
the
chicks
and
with
that
higher
abv
will
help
out
some
of
us
homely
beer
geeks
get
lucky
woot
very
nice
raspberry
colored
red
with
a
small
pink
colored
head
and
very
nice
carbonation
visible
throughout
the
session
the
smell
was
rich
with
raspberry
essence
extremely
strong
so
that
nothing
else
could
possibly
come
through
now
the
flavor
was
to
die
for
i
have
never
been
the
biggest
fan
of
fruit
beers
in
general
but
this
has
just
come
to
a
whole
new
level
so
sweet
yet
tart
and
sour
at
the
same
time
the
flavor
was
so
strong
yet
not
overpowering
and
not
too
sweet
as
to
make
you
sick
it
was
in
a
word
perfect
it
had
the
most
perfect
taste
for
this
style
i
could
have
ever
imagined
a
great
light
body
and
great
carbonation
made
it
feel
like
water
and
there
was
just
no
hint
of
any
kind
of
alcohol
in
this
this
was
by
far
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
ever
had
o
yum
4
overall
impression
ive
had
this
one
in
bottle
and
have
to
say
it
is
even
better
on
tap
it
was
creamier
and
fresher
tasting
ontap
while
i
still
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
brew
i
am
still
looking
forward
to
the
canadian
breakfast
stout
coming
out
in
october
keep
it
up
founders
o
super
flavorful
very
well
balanced
raspberry
brew
tons
of
raspberry
flavor
but
shy
of
a
lambic
still
keeps
its
beer
body
this
beer
was
certainly
a
treat
to
try
however
for
me
a
single
glass
was
enough
in
fact
too
much
its
very
sweet
and
tart
as
one
would
expect
but
the
flavors
are
very
well
done
and
not
overbearing
to
the
point
where
its
offputting
if
you
like
red
fruits
namely
raspberries
this
is
certainly
one
beer
you
absolutely
must
try
similar
brews
lindemans
framboise
o
overall
a
very
tasty
treat
perhaps
better
suited
for
a
dessert
beer
or
on
top
of
vanilla
ice
cream
still
very
good
with
an
abundance
of
raspberry
flavor
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
could
get
somebody
in
alot
of
trouble
and
could
serve
very
well
pairing
with
a
fruity
cheesecake
or
other
berry
dessert
wow
what
a
surprise
thanks
to
my
friend
that
brought
it
over
with
7
ribeye
steaks
this
beer
poured
into
my
great
lakes
pilsener
glass
blood
red
with
a
pink
carbonated
head
some
light
lacing
down
to
the
bottom
aromas
of
huge
fresh
raspberries
and
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
very
strong
sweetness
on
the
nose
taste
is
thick
and
syrupy
but
not
as
sweet
as
you
would
expect
a
nice
balanced
tartness
some
notes
of
tart
raspberries
linger
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
with
some
spiciness
from
the
yeast
no
alcohol
noticed
in
the
taste
or
finish
hidden
very
well

who
would
have
thunk
it
what
a
treat
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
hot
pink
head
looks
crazy
smells
strongly
of
raspberries
taste
is
sublime
big
raspberry
sweetness
up
front
with
just
the
right
amount
of
tart
carbonation
is
slightly
higher
than
lets
say
a
lambic
but
not
huge
very
drinkable
my
mother
hates
beer
all
together
but
loved
this
she
still
doesnt
believe
its
a
beer
overall
amazing
beer
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
beautiful
raspberry
flavor
but
it
is
one
dimensional
overall
while
blushing
monk
isnt
very
complex
it
is
the
oppitome
of
fresh
i
cant
imagine
drinking
this
or
any
fruit
vegetable
beer
all
the
time
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
medium
mouthfeel
and
no
real
notice
of
the
alcohol
this
years
version
says
9
2
abv
not
over
12
as
in
past
years
superb
brew
once
again
from
founders
they
rarely
disappoint
overall
although
i
might
have
preferred
a
bit
more
tartness
or
yeasty
funk
this
is
still
a
very
nice
example
of
what
can
be
done
with
a
fruit
beer
i
split
this
bottle
with
the
girlfriend
not
sure
if
i
could
finish
a
whole
one
myself
but
we
both

blushing
monk
pours
an
impossibly
deep
plum
its
almost
solid
when
held
to
light
with
only
very
faint
ruby
highlights
shining
through
the
first
pour
yielded
barely
two
fingers
of
foam
while
the
second
pour
manages
to
churn
up
a
full
three
fingers
worth
retention
is
alright
and
theres
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
but
the
color
of
the
head
is
what
really
grabs
attention
its
the
offspring
of
lavender
and
a
dark
pinklight
red
shade
and
its
much
more
vivid
than
the
head
from
any
other
fruit
beer
ive
ever
seen
the
nose
is
quite
potent
and
it
screams
raspberries
with
just
a
little
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
present
as
well
the
flavor
is
just
as
one
note
as
the
aroma
and
it
really
gets
old
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
bottle
the
flavor
is
exclusively
of
sugared
up
raspberries
and
people
referring
to
to
the
beer
as
alcoholic
raspberry
soda
arent
off
base
at
all
the
body
is
a
little
flabby
especially
for
a
belgian
brew
but
the
sparkling
carbonation
is
perfectly
suited
to
the
beer
this
is
one
that
would
be
much
better
served
by
a
smaller
serving
size
as
the
all
out
raspberry
assault
quickly
gets
old
this
is
an
extremely
interesting
and
in
many
ways
excellent
beer
the
raspberry
character
is
fantastic
and
dominates
the
flavor
and
aroma
its
almost
a
little
too
much
in
fact
a
little
more
beer
character
might
be
nice
although
the
belgian
yeast
helped
with
that
the
sweetness
also
could
be
a
bit
much
at
times
so
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
dessert
beer
also
although
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
this
is
a
strong
beer
and
best
split
between
two
or
more
people
all
quibbles
aside
though
its
very
nice
and
a
good
bet
for
a
special
occasion
or
changeofpace
beer
recommended
pours
a
pretty
maroonred
color
with
nice
purplishpink
head
on
top
nose
is
not
as
overly
sweet
as
some
describe
but
a
blast
of
tart
fresh
raspberries
hits
with
more
exploration
some
of
the
malt
comes
through
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
but
really
this
is
just
a
fruit
bomb
flavor
is
quite
good
not
cloyingly
sweet
but
sweet
nonetheless
just
robust
fruit
flavor
here
like
fresh
raspberries
somehow
it
is
balanced
out
so
as
to
not
be
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
too
heavy
and
sticky
but
not
too
light
like
a
champagne
or
something
moderate
to
full
carbonation
helps
to
keep
this
one
from
becoming
too
sticky
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
its
good
and
a
damn
fine
fruit
beer
but
not
a
beer
that
im
going
nuts
for
o
this
has
really
good
drinkability
even
though
it
has
a
pretty
heavy
body
and
high
alcohol
it
drinks
just
like
juice
juice
with
more
complexity
mind
you
i
am
really
enjoying
the
flavor
of
this
its
hard
to
put
down
i
think
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
fruit
beer
i
recommend
trying
it
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
i
have
to
say
its
good
but
not
something
id
buy
a
bunch
of
its
honestly
too
much
like
juice
for
me
so
since
i
think
it
is
about
average
i
will
give
it
a
cish
score
overall
im
glad
that
i
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
and
i
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
one
more
i
look
forward
to
what
founders
has
in
store
for
its
750ml
bottles
and
i
hope
in
the
future
this
one
gets
brewed
again
o
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
having
tried
founders
cerise
before
this
blew
away
my
preconceived
notion
of
what
founders
can
do
a
great
finish
to
a
decent
weekend
hooray
for
pleasant
surprises
o
i
think
this
would
be
more
interesting
if
it
was
fermented
with
brett
and
other
wild
yeasts
sickeningly
sweet
followed
by
a
god
awful
throatchest
burn
gee
can
i
buy
some
more
of
this
worst
beer
ive
had
from
founders
hands
down
yes
my
overall
score
exceeds
most
of
the
rest
of
the
scores
this
beer
is
9
2
abv
the
one
listed
above
must
be
from
the
previous
batches
and
ive
had
difficulty
not
gulping
this
beer
down
i
like
it
that
much
if
this
had
been
touted
by
the
brewery
as
simply
a
fruit
beer
than
this
may
have
been
much
higher
but
claiming
it
is
belgian
style
invokes
thoughts
of
fruitflavored
lambics
and
this
doesnt
compare
still
i
do
love
this
beer
and
will
be
eagerly
seeking
its
next
release
overall
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
it
is
unique
and
worth
a
try
i
can
see
chicks
really
diggn
this
beer
because
its
sooo
fruity
founders
delivers
another
fantastic
beer
must
try
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
definitely
not
your
average
fruit
beer
found
this
refreshing
despite
abv
being
on
the
higher
side
alcohol
is
not
even
noticeable
reminds
me
of
a
sparkling
fruit
juice
more
so
than
a
beer
pours
a
deep
blood
red
with
about
an
inch
or
so
of
bubbly
purple
head
the
body
looks
nearly
black
in
the
glass
but
retains
an
ominous
red
glow
when
held
to
the
light
it
looks
absolutely
stunning
smells
as
one
might
suspect
of
raspberries
crisp
refreshing
raspberries
without
the
artificial
sugar
scent
dominate
the
nose
but
some
yeasty
belgianlike
scents
escape
the
depths
and
are
vaguely
noticeable
taste
is
very
similar
being
primarily
of
fresh
raspberries
so
much
that
it
reminds
me
of
homemade
raspberry
jam
it
is
slightly
sugary
in
the
mouth
but
the
carbonation
helps
it
from
being
overlyso
it
also
seems
to
bring
out
the
tiny
bit
of
belgian
pale
character
that
lies
beneath
the
surface
as
some
yeasty
notes
can
be
found
rather
readily
after
the
raspberry
punch
subsides
a
small
amount
of
warming
alcohol
lives
at
the
end
the
carbonation
is
great
and
helps
the
beer
finish
slightly
dry
instead
of
stickysugary
overall
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
o
im
reluctant
to
give
any
beer
an
overall
5
rating
but
if
there
was
ever
a
beer
that
i
would
give
such
a
rating
to
this
would
be
my
pick
i
completely
understand
if
some
people
really
dont
like
fruit
beer
but
i
do
and
this
one
is
the
best
ive
ever
had
thank
you
founders
for
taking
such
pride
in
your
work
a
big
strong
malty
fruit
beer
unlike
any
ive
had
before
its
like
a
cross
between
a
typical
lowabv
fruit
beer
and
a
barleywine
quite
tasty
and
hard
to
believe
its
as
strong
as
it
is
im
torn
on
this
beer
at
times
it
can
be
a
great
sweet
rush
of
raspberry
juiciness
at
others
its
a
sickly
sweet
mouth
full
of
carbonated
raspberry
juice
there
isnt
much
depth
or
complexity
to
it
no
sign
of
the
belgian
yeast
and
none
of
the
abv
shows
its
face
at
all
probably
best
enjoyed
in
small
samples
rather
than
full
pours
i
really
was
happy
to
be
able
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
try
everyone
agreed
though
that
the
pour
they
had
was
enough
its
very
sweet
and
tart
although
quite
flavorful
it
just
may
be
a
bit
too
over
the
top
for
some
youve
been
warned
on
tap
at
founders
brewing
dark
purplered
pour
with
very
pink
foam
aroma
of
pure
raspberry
seeds
and
all
taste
is
sweet
with
only
a
slight
natural
tartness
from
the
raspberries
and
finishes
with
a
slight
touch
of
belgian
ale
yeastiness
as
though
to
make
sure
the
sweet
fruity
flavors
dont
go
on
forever
palate
has
medium
carbonation
and
is
quite
full
bodied
i
never
thought
i
would
like
this
beer
so
much
it
was
our
favorite
of
the
night
founders
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
flavor
wasnt
artificial
at
all
i
would
definitely
have
another
if
i
get
the
chance
notes
i
wasnt
expecting
the
sourness
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
welcome
addition
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
on
the
market
a
tad
onedimensional
maybe
and
not
very
complex
but
i
love
it
for
what
it
is
comparable
in
some
ways
to
troegs
mad
elf
though
i
like
this
better
an
onslaught
of
real
raspberry
flavor
that
seems
never
ending
something
i
wish
more
brewers
would
do
but
i
think
they
are
deterred
from
fruit
beers
because
the
category
is
sort
of
a
guilty
pleasure
among
most
serious
beer
drinkers
a
very
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
glad
i
tried
it
o
huge
and
massive
fruit
at
every
turn
an
exercise
is
excess
that
is
fun
to
try
but
not
likely
something
im
going
to
be
wanting
on
a
regular
basis
it
receives
my
recommendation
but
isnt
one
ill
be
stocking
up
on
45
note
while
this
could
totally
stand
alone
as
a
dessert
i
highly
recommend
tasting
this
with
the
highest
grade
dark
chocolate
that
you
can
get
your
hands
on
pours
a
deep
red
witha
pink
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
dry
presence
of
fruit
in
the
taste
quite
fruity
especially
raspberry
with
a
dry
texture
to
a
small
sweetness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruity
raspberry
like
aftertaste
still
quite
fruity
but
hides
the
alcohol
and
not
overbearing
at
all
vintage
2011
figured
since
i
was
seeing
a
few
friends
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
id
bust
out
a
bottle
o
something
nice
here
goes
it
pours
a
deep
dark
ruby
topped
by
plenty
o
relatively
shortlived
dark
pink
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
raspberry
light
black
cherry
and
red
grapes
damn
now
thats
a
lot
o
raspberry
fella
the
taste
holds
notes
of
straight
raspberry
as
though
youre
biting
into
a
bunch
o
fresh
ones
very
light
cherry
cranberry
and
currant
a
light
tartness
pervades
but
doesnt
get
very
strong
at
any
point
at
some
point
the
cranberries
seem
to
take
over
i
never
thought
id
say
this
but
there
might
be
too
much
berryness
in
here
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
syrupy
feel
overall
i
get
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
berry
bomb
but
i
think
they
went
too
far
this
time
there
is
no
semblance
of
any
base
beer
or
of
any
belgian
character
for
that
matter
just
berries
berries
and
more
berries
i
thought
i
liked
berries
but
this
was
nearly
too
much
for
my
own
good
nearly
overall
pretty
good
it
isnt
something
you
can
drink
everyday
but
a
nice
after
dinner
dessert
beer
for
sure
overall
this
was
way
more
over
the
top
raspberry
than
i
expected
its
a
sipper
because
of
the
combination
of
alcohol
and
tartness
that
being
said
raspberries
are
one
of
my
favorite
fruits
so
im
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
this
gfunk
o
overall
this
is
yet
another
excellent
one
from
founders
even
better
than
raspberry
tart
imo
smell
is
raspberries
raspberries
raspberries
with
darker
fruits
just
below
naming
dark
hints
of
plum
and
fig
citrus
hints
smells
sweeter
than
it
tastes
taste
wraps
the
tongue
and
throat
in
rich
freshcrushed
raspberry
cider
not
too
sweet
thankfully
and
ends
drying
and
astringent
begging
for
another
sip
grownup
fruit
juice
marvelous
fantastic
thank
you
o
very
unique
style
and
very
well
made
i
highly
suggest
sharing
this
beer
with
friends
and
family
as
it
is
a
great
experience
even
for
novices
certainly
a
very
memorable
belgian
enjoy
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
raspberry
ale
it
was
worth
the
price
ohad
one
from
2007
that
was
better
can
you
imagine
that
better
anyways
buy
2
one
for
now
and
one
for
later
o
brewers
of
the
world
the
fruit
beer
bar
has
just
been
raised
once
again
founders
has
given
the
beer
community
something
that
is
lovable
intriguing
exciting
and
just
plain
unforgettable
its
beer
like
this
that
make
me
want
to
take
the
trip
to
grand
rapids
just
for
the
founders
taproom
mark
my
words
ill
be
there
by
years
end
o
this
is
different
i
have
4
well
3
bottles
i
shall
be
getting
used
to
this
style
in
time
bright
reddish
purple
pour
looks
like
red
wine
or
grape
juice
short
lived
pink
head
that
leaves
filmy
lace
when
swirled
certainly
a
nice
looking
beer
very
sweet
lindeman
sweet
aroma
very
pungent
and
full
you
just
know
this
is
going
to
be
sticky
and
it
is
i
am
drinking
jam
here
so
very
sweet
and
clinging
i
wish
did
have
some
tartness
to
round
things
out
but
this
is
not
that
kind
of
beer
this
is
a
dessert
beer
of
creme
brulee
proportions
drinking
a
bomber
of
this
was
too
much
i
could
not
cut
it
i
was
not
worthy
i
capped
it
and
finished
it
the
next
day
with
a
turkey
sandwich
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
you
will
not
be
able
to
drink
enough
of
it
in
one
evening
for
that
to
matter
meant
to
be
shared
most
def
as
a
big
fan
of
founders
belgian
styles
and
raspberryflavored
beers
i
opened
this
with
much
anticipation
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
in
the
end
just
could
not
fully
appreciate
it
poured
a
deep
purple
like
grape
juice
with
a
tight
bright
pink
head
first
sip
was
pronounced
raspberry
almost
cloyingly
sweet
at
first
and
then
rapidly
shifting
gear
to
moderate
tartness
belgian
character
of
beer
was
largely
overshadowed
by
the
fruit
flavor
with
candy
sugar
being
the
most
noteworthy
contribution
the
fruit
flavor
was
simply
overwhelming
the
sort
where
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
perhaps
as
an
after
dinner
digestif
this
would
be
good
but
no
quaffer
here
how
does
founders
do
it
they
make
unbelievable
stouts
ipas
and
dipas
how
do
they
also
do
such
a
solid
job
with
a
fruit
beer
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
to
date
that
isnt
a
lambic
truly
a
tasty
treat
that
didnt
grow
tiresome
for
me
at
all
glad
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
cellar
overall
this
beer
will
change
your
view
on
fruit
beers
forever
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
just
raspberry
this
bomber
though
is
meant
to
be
shared
a
whole
bottle
would
be
too
much
medium
richly
smooth
bodied
with
a
lightish
amount
of
carbonation
the
brew
glides
down
to
the
gullet
without
a
hitch
and
where
i
ask
you
where
is
the
9
alcohol
no
sign
of
it
in
the
taste
and
i
reckon
theres
not
much
evidence
of
it
after
the
swallow
either
great
brew
o
im
not
digging
this
one
at
all
tastes
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
but
to
each
their
own
cheers
o
a
really
good
fruit
beer
but
thats
kind
of
like
a
really
good
meeting
with
your
boss
youd
rather
have
done
something
else
but
youre
glad
it
was
pretty
good
but
it
would
always
be
hard
to
say
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
d
this
is
good
but
taking
down
a
750ml
of
this
was
more
daunting
of
a
task
than
anticipated
that
being
said
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
an
8oz
pour
would
have
been
perfect
over
time
the
sweetness
and
sugar
got
to
me
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
founders
offering
overall
this
is
by
far
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
had
period
its
strong
in
the
beer
department
which
is
key
and
doesnt
taste
like
sweet
fruit
juice
which
is
a
big
complaint
of
many
fruit
beers
the
fruit
tastes
freshauthentic
as
well
compared
to
some
which
taste
like
artificial
from
extract
really
outstanding
beer
overall
founders
proves
again
why
they
are
my
favorite
brewery
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
my
8
oz
pour
was
just
enoughi
dont
know
if
i
could
of
drank
much
more
best
to
share
this
one
medium
bodied
sweet
tart
low
to
medium
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
9
2
abv
beer
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
that
i
have
more
bottles
to
drink
for
later
well
done
but
that
is
what
you
expect
from
the
folks
at
founders
all
around
great
beer
that
i
wish
was
offered
all
around
the
calander
ive
not
had
much
experience
with
fruit
beers
but
i
can
easily
imagine
how
this
style
can
fail
in
execution
from
this
perspective
i
think
this
beer
is
quite
the
success
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
as
its
not
a
preferred
style
but
im
certainly
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
o
some
friends
had
the
previous
version
of
this
and
raved
about
it
and
im
really
happy
to
have
had
the
newest
batch
that
said
after
this
i
find
myself
longing
for
the
subtle
complexity
of
kasteel
rouge
think
a
higher
abv
like
the
original
version
would
help
this
beer
a
good
deal
still
a
huge
founders
fan
and
ill
happily
try
all
the
backstage
series
beers
notes
this
is
the
first
time
im
saying
this
and
maybe
the
last
time
this
tastes
more
like
a
fruit
wine
than
beer
it
really
tastes
to
me
like
they
fermented
out
raspberry
juice
with
champagne
yeast
lovely
delicious
refreshing
and
jammy
dont
get
any
semblance
of
belgian
yeast
or
beer
flavors
o
a
very
solid
fruit
beer
and
one
of
the
more
interesting
the
yeast
adds
a
complexity
that
usually
lacks
from
straightforward
fruit
beers
i
enjoyed
the
refreshing
quality
that
the
fruit
brought
but
also
the
almost
fruit
stout
feel
brought
on
by
just
how
many
raspberries
were
in
this
o
a
great
brew
with
delicious
raspberry
flavor
and
good
alcohol
content
another
amazing
beer
from
founders
and
worth
trying
its
great
after
one
but
more
would
be
overbearing
this
brew
is
perfectly
balanced
it
has
a
quick
decay
as
well
o
a
very
very
good
fruit
beer
i
think
this
is
a
close
second
on
my
list
of
favorite
raspberry
beers
behind
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
which
is
practically
flawless
glad
i
was
able
to
obtain
one
of
these
and
it
does
hold
up
to
the
hypedemand
pretty
well
i
have
no
regrets
for
the
18
i
spent
on
this
bottle
but
after
having
this
i
know
that
for
half
the
price
and
a
little
bit
of
effort
setting
up
a
trade
i
can
get
all
the
raspberry
tart
i
want
and
be
even
happier
this
beer
pours
a
full
bodied
dark
red
reminiscent
of
a
framboise
with
a
two
finger
valentines
day
pink
head
it
smells
of
belgian
yeast
and
sweet
and
tart
raspberry
puree
the
raspberry
is
overpowering
and
delicious
it
tastes
of
sweet
raspberries
first
and
foremost
with
a
moderate
tartness
and
a
belgian
yeast
finish
it
offers
complexity
in
terms
of
raspberry
offering
every
aspect
of
the
fruit
but
the
beer
itself
is
dominated
by
the
raspberry
it
is
delicious
and
is
like
an
imperial
framboise
it
drinks
full
in
body
and
really
is
a
big
beer
i
couldnt
be
more
pleased
with
it
its
an
exceptional
beer
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
i
cant
wait
to
open
an
07
in
the
following
months
o
i
liked
this
a
lot
but
it
is
a
bit
too
simple
at
first
i
was
really
stoked
on
this
beer
but
after
a
bit
i
was
pretty
numbed
by
the
overwhelming
hand
of
raspberries
half
the
glass
and
my
palate
was
numbed
i
wasnt
pulling
anything
else
of
this
glass
at
that
point
normally
its
the
alcohol
thats
numbing
but
in
this
case
it
was
the
ingredients
that
said
if
you
are
a
raspberry
freak
then
my
friend
the
eagle
has
landed
outrageous
raspberry
fruit
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
some
more
complexity
an
accomplishment
in
solid
execution
with
an
ingredient
but
twotones
of
complexity
at
best
o
this
beer
is
damn
delicious
on
deliciousness
alone
this
thing
would
get
an
a
however
i
would
like
to
see
this
beer
calmed
down
just
a
bit
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
a
little
more
tartness
instead
of
sweetness
and
fewer
raspberries
point
is
they
may
have
overdone
it
a
bit
on
the
huge
raspberry
sweetness
still
love
it
but
to
be
a
truly
perfected
a
beer
this
thing
will
take
some
tweaking
o
thicker
than
a
regular
fruit
beer
with
way
more
alcohol
but
not
in
a
bad
way
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
skal
o
this
is
a
sipper
and
the
bottle
should
definitely
be
shared
served
alone
or
possibly
with
cheesecake
this
beer
would
make
a
wonderful
desert
solid
take
on
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
think
its
worth
the
15
price
of
admission
however
my
wife
raved
about
the
brew
labeling
it
one
of
the
best
beers
shes
ever
had
well
done
founders
o
i
had
ng
raspberry
tart
last
night
and
i
must
say
that
i
enjoy
this
brew
much
much
more
im
not
getting
any
of
the
medicinal
notes
i
picked
up
with
the
ng
beer
fruit
beers
are
growing
on
me
and
this
is
another
awesome
example
a
wonderful
beer
to
enjoy
with
friends
on
a
wonderful
day
it
is
a
bit
pricey
for
the
style
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
i
was
curious
to
see
what
would
develop
from
this
style
of
beer
however
founders
has
found
a
way
to
make
a
positive
contribution
to
fruitvegetable
beers
much
lighter
bodied
and
very
easily
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
i
just
wanted
to
keep
gulping
it
down
i
believe
our
bottle
was
somewhere
around
9
perhaps
the
latest
version
not
sure
overall
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
sweet
and
sugary
but
the
fruit
profile
is
undeniably
excellent
im
looking
forward
to
trying
to
the
2007
version
soon
to
see
how
it
compares
the
sweetness
limits
the
drinkability
so
you
i
wouldnt
recommend
opening
this
alone
this
would
be
good
on
french
toast
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
pretty
darn
good
fruit
beer
and
appreciated
its
balance
of
sweet
to
dry
it
was
full
of
fresh
berry
flavors
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
fruity
to
be
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
interestingly
my
wife
who
really
likes
sweet
fruit
lambics
found
this
beer
to
be
too
dry
go
figure
o
good
lambicstyle
belgian
ale
by
founders
very
intense
fruit
beer
worth
trying
but
it
lacks
some
desired
complexity
overall
founders
did
a
great
job
with
this
fruit
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
only
problem
is
i
could
only
get
one
bottle
reminds
me
a
lot
of
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
o
pleasantly
not
what
i
was
expecting
loads
and
loads
of
raspberry
flavor
if
anything
id
say
i
wish
i
had
someone
to
share
the
bottle
with
over
the
length
of
imbibing
the
sweetness
seemed
to
get
stronger
o
there
has
been
a
lot
of
hype
over
this
beer
is
it
worth
the
high
price
tag
my
opinion
yes
but
just
barely
maybe
not
even
that
its
a
fruit
beer
that
doesnt
suck
and
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
do
suck
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
and
its
as
drinkable
as
you
could
ask
for
for
a
beer
approaching
10
abv
but
it
isnt
stellar
it
feels
like
its
missing
a
little
bit
of
body
or
substance
am
amazing
beer
not
much
could
be
improved
o
fantastic
beer
but
too
sweet
to
drink
often
perfect
as
an
interesting
dessert
option
considering
it
as
such
its
stellar
within
its
style
this
is
a
stellar
fruit
beer
if
all
fruit
beers
were
like
this
one
it
would
be
my
favorite
style
i
just
cannot
find
a
complaint
about
it
my
wife
even
had
the
idea
to
make
a
beer
float
with
it
and
a
scoop
of
black
raspberry
chip
icream
amazing
overall
the
main
thing
that
i
noticed
different
about
this
beer
was
that
i
couldnt
pick
out
the
alcohol
i
guess
the
small
drop
made
a
difference
a
really
solid
beer
o
very
nice
raspberry
drink
its
hard
to
call
it
a
beer
but
its
still
really
refreshing
made
for
a
nice
50th
review
on
an
excessive
heat
warning
day
well
i
almost
passed
on
this
one
but
my
wife
convinced
me
to
try
it
i
had
to
then
split
it
with
her
pours
a
very
dark
purple
almost
black
into
my
tulip
glass
interesting
dark
pink
headnever
seen
that
one
before
smells
strongly
of
sweet
fruit
like
rasberry
duh
or
strawberry
tastes
a
bit
like
a
wine
cooler
not
that
ive
ever
had
one
but
something
holds
the
fruit
back
from
overpowering
part
of
that
must
be
the
mouthfeel
which
is
a
little
thicker
and
less
carbonated
that
a
wine
cooler
geez
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
is
tasty
and
refreshing
on
this
extremely
hot
day
meanwhile
im
sitting
in
ac
lighter
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
that
gives
a
fuller
feel
some
alcohol
present
but
blends
in
well
this
is
an
amazing
fruit
beer
this
is
all
about
the
raspberries
maybe
the
belgian
yeast
adds
that
earthy
note
not
sweet
but
also
not
sour
truly
unique
o
great
beer
if
a
steeped
raspberry
character
is
what
youre
searching
for
not
at
all
overdone
if
you
prefer
a
lindemans
extremely
sweet
and
syrupy
beer
this
one
is
probably
not
for
you
overall
very
interesting
probably
one
and
done
but
its
anvery
enjoyable
one
pours
a
ruby
beet
color
with
a
cap
of
pink
froth
nose
of
bready
yeast
and
ripe
raspberries
nice
balance
in
the
flavor
between
ripe
fruit
and
tart
a
little
fruit
seed
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
very
light
tannin
the
more
i
sip
the
more
this
justs
tastes
like
fermented
ripre
raspberries
yum
i
have
to
say
for
the
style
i
prefer
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
at
about
half
the
cost
and
constant
availability
this
brew
is
a
bit
more
fruit
heavy
and
thick
in
the
mouth
than
the
crisp
sweettart
ng
rt
still
a
great
beer
all
around
overall
really
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
change
up
from
typical
beers
a
bit
to
tart
aftertaste
that
makes
you
almost
want
to
chance
it
with
another
drink
really
good
drink
would
like
to
have
one
aged
a
few
years
pours
almost
purple
in
color
has
a
little
pinkish
foam
but
no
head
smells
like
fresh
raspberries
and
lots
of
sweetness
almost
like
a
sweet
dessert
wine
at
first
youre
hit
with
a
ton
of
sweetness
then
it
turns
to
a
mouth
puckering
tartness
yet
goes
down
too
smooth
this
bottle
wont
last
long
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
sticky
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
i
wish
they
made
this
year
round
if
you
get
the
chance
you
gotta
try
this
beer
o
really
great
representation
of
the
style
my
fear
was
that
the
sweetness
would
overpower
the
taste
but
it
worked
nicely
and
really
blew
me
away
loved
it
o
blushing
monk
is
a
great
beer
for
lovers
of
raspberries
fruit
beers
or
dessert
beers
very
much
of
a
onenote
beer
though
and
drinkability
is
suspect
at
best
pored
into
pint
glass
pours
dark
ruby
but
clear
onefinger
head
the
color
of
strawberry
milk
lovely
strange
pour
nose
is
fresh
mashed
raspberries
along
with
a
strong
raspberry
seed
character
and
wood
notes
hints
of
belgian
yeast
tastes
great
good
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
fine
effort
overall
extremely
good
the
raspberry
flavor
is
very
pronounced
but
not
overpowering
or
too
sour
or
sweet
i
think
the
high
alcohol
takes
away
from
the
fruit
flavor
but
its
still
an
amazing
beer
if
you
want
you
can
compare
it
to
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
but
that
is
a
much
lower
alcohol
beer
so
the
raspberry
stands
out
a
great
deal
more
o
a
good
fruit
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
was
expecting
more
of
a
sour
beer
the
yeastiness
of
the
beer
makes
it
a
little
different
and
a
slow
drinker
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
not
pay
the
15
for
it
again
glad
i
had
this
now
because
i
would
have
bought
another
if
i
found
one
moderately
thick
for
a
fruit
beer
but
on
par
for
a
9
2
ale
carbonation
is
also
quite
low
but
there
to
break
up
the
monotony
founders
blushing
monk
is
a
topnotch
fruit
beer
fruity
without
being
cloying
and
high
in
alcohol
without
being
boozy
im
shocked
that
the
abv
is
listed
at
12
3
is
that
correct
i
thought
it
was
9something
good
mouthfeel
compared
to
the
other
topnotch
fruit
beers
its
nice
to
see
that
blushing
monk
gets
some
distribution
even
if
it
only
comes
out
once
every
few
years
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
fruit
is
very
well
done
and
i
liked
the
fact
that
it
was
more
sweet
than
sour
the
belgian
yeast
was
a
unique
twist
as
well
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
highly
enjoyed
with
my
wife
a
good
fruit
beer
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
but
maybe
a
bit
sweet
and
onenote
for
my
tastes
the
7oz
or
so
pour
i
got
was
a
good
amount
definitely
surprised
me
in
a
very
confusing
way
i
really
dont
know
how
i
really
feel
about
this
beer
other
than
i
would
never
every
pay
for
it
again
id
have
a
glass
if
offered
to
me
or
something
but
seriously
if
youre
going
to
sip
on
this
just
make
yourself
a
raspberry
screwdriver
and
safe
yourself
some
money
glad
i
tried
it
for
the
novelty
but
i
immediately
reached
over
for
some
surly
furious
after
this
one
to
get
my
taste
buds
out
of
the
raspberry
funk
they
were
in
too
much
raspberries
could
have
made
it
a
much
more
interesting
beer
who
knows
with
so
much
sugar
maybe
leaving
this
one
in
the
cellar
might
do
some
kwirky
ol
things
to
it
o
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
wish
i
would
have
gotten
a
couple
bottles
of
this
when
it
was
released
in
the
area
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
everything
about
this
was
good
a
very
enjoyable
drink
overall
im
glad
this
one
made
it
to
bottles
again
especially
in
the
22
oz
medium
great
scents
and
flavors
and
a
tartness
that
keeps
it
refreshing
and
prevents
it
from
becoming
a
sugary
mess
weight
acidity
and
abv
would
slow
me
down
a
bit
on
this
one
but
i
really
enjoy
beers
like
this
on
occasion
and
i
may
be
picking
up
at
least
one
more
i
guess
it
lived
up
to
the
15bottle
price
tag
at
least
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
seriously
big
raspberry
beer
though
i
never
would
have
guessed
the
abv
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
drinkable
as
he
sweetness
is
pretty
massive
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
overall
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
beast
of
a
fruit
beer
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
the
abv
was
so
high
very
well
done
as
the
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
and
the
yeast
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
well
worth
a
shot
o
the
abounding
raspberry
aroma
leads
to
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
flavor
where
its
a
bit
more
syruplike
than
fresh
and
potent
i
can
say
though
that
this
beer
pairs
fantastically
with
sartoris
awardwinning
bellavitano
gold
cheese
mmm
i
am
completely
blown
away
i
know
i
may
be
motivated
by
the
press
and
the
buzzbut
for
some
reason
this
is
one
of
the
most
fantastic
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
like
a
key
in
a
lock
baby
absolutely
amazing
raspberry
fruit
beer
one
of
my
favorites
though
one
that
would
be
for
occasional
drinking
only
much
too
sweet
to
have
often
i
dig
the
good
fruit
beers
it
tastes
authentic
and
brings
the
raspberry
bomb
to
the
table
similar
to
new
glarus

shit
is
this
great
after
3
years
nose
is
huge
rich
and
fruity
taste
is
semisweet
tart
smooth
as
hell
wow
one
side
note
fantastic
when
properly
proportioned
with
cantillon
bruocsella
1900
experiment
at
will
youll
have
a
lot
left
in
your
bomber
o
this
is
the
fruitiest
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
it
isnt
something
id
want
to
drink
regularly
but
it
is
very
well
done
an
interesting
break
from
my
usual
stout
or
ipa
overall
its
amazing
and
i
usually
share
but
with
this
one
i
hated
sharing
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
extremely
easy
drinkability
the
abv
is
hidden
well
the
raspberry
flavor
coming
out
is
fantastic
like
i
said
earlier
this
beer
gets
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
after
a
couple
of
glasses
this
is
a
beer
to
share
with
others
fuller
medium
body
lower
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
almost
dries
out
the
tongue
after
a
while
one
of
the
better
nonsour
fruit
beers
ive
had
and
definitely
right
up
there
with
raspberry
tart
edit

this
got
amazing
so
balanced
and
smooth
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
could
not
be
any
better
tickles
the
tongue
with
sourness
but
is
incredible
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
almost
non
existent
and
i
cant
state
enough
how
surprised
i
was
that
this
beer
is
so
good
expensive
but
well
worth
the
money
notes
founders
brews
some
of
my
all
time
favorite
brews
and
then
stuff
like
this
it
is
not
as
bad
as
their
cerise
but
the
experience
with
their
fruit
brews
this
one
lacks
the
complex
boozy
punch
of
say
dfhs
fort
or
the
tart
nuances
of
a
good
lambic
quite
surprised
by
the
hype
generated
by
this
brew
and
that
this
one
was
selected
as
the
first
release
in
big
bottles
pours
a
bright
light
purple
color
that
is
quite
similar
to
a
light
grape
juice
really
nice
head
with
a
slight
pinkish
hue
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
loads
of
raspberry
to
the
level
of
barqs
raspberry
cream
soda
not
much
depth
but
i
dont
really
care
especially
once
it
gets
into
the
flavor
there
is
some
slight
yeastiness
on
the
backend
of
the
flavor
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
just
a
raspberry
assault
that
is
absolutely
beautiful
some
light
earthiness
especially
in
the
feel
lightly
tart
and
fairly
sweet
though
not
too
much
really
outstanding
beer
o
drinks
extraordinarily
well
for
the
alcohol
content
simple
but
really
well
done
very
sweet
and
would
make
for
an
excellent
dessert
beer
an
insanely
intense
display
of
raspberry
avoiding
all
the
common
flaws
of
typical
fruit
beers
and
with
the
excessive
use
of
fruit
its
remarkable
how
vibrant
and
true
that
this
beer
is
to
nature
and
the
character
of
the
plant
o
i
have
no
problems
drinking
this
beer
and
find
it
to
feel
more
beer
like
than
many
other
vedgie
beers
but
i
dont
know
something
about
it
maybe
it
is
just
the
style
in
general
but
it
doesnt
feel
like
beer
to
me
i
think
it
is
the
mouth
overall
an
enjoyable
experience
and
i
plan
to
try
and
get
ahold
of
a
few
more
bottles
very
good
overall
a
really
nice
beer
that
is
one
of
the
stronger
flavored
fruit
beers
ive
tried
and
for
s
9
2
beer
its
a
great
dessert
ive
been
anxious
to
try
this
brew
since
founders
announced
they
were
going
to
be
bottling
it
pours
a
magnificent
deep
burgundy
with
a
slight
pinkishtinged
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
raspberries
with
some
candied
sugar
coming
through
just
a
bit
the
taste
closely
follows
the
smell
with
the
sweet
raspberries
more
apparent
on
the
initial
taste
and
a
more
tart
drying
finishquite
pleasant
this
is
a
brew
that
i
couldnt
drink
regularly
but
as
a
dessert
beer
cherrypeach
cobbler
come
to
mind
or
maybe
even
paired
with
fruit
salad
this
beer
would
be
perfect
the
alcohol
really
isnt
that
apparent
although
im
sure
after
a
750ml
bottle
of
this
youd
likely
know
it
was
there
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
try
in
one
of
these
scenarios
nice
job
founders
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
it
was
a
chore
to
finish
a
750
because
of
the
high
sweetness
but
one
glass
is
extremely
easy
to
put
down
the
abv
note
9
2
on
the
label
not
12
3
is
nonexistant
cheers
the
flavor
is
best
described
as
a
raspberry
bomb
very
sweet
little
evidence
of
hops
malt
or
yeast
initially
the
yeast
becomes
more
apparent
as
it
warms
some
of
that
metallic
quality
shows
up
in
the
finish
long
sweet
finish
this
is
a
16
liquid
dessert
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
a
big
beer
to
be
sure
overall
its
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
its
a
well
made
beer
o
i
love
it
it
doesnt
do
much
else
other
than
tart
raspberries
but
then
again
it
doesnt
need
to
again
this
is
handsdown
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
come
across
highly
recommended
despite
the
hefty
price
tag
overall
being
a
huge
raspberry
fan
in
general
i
knew
id
like
this
beer
after
drinking
it
i
can
confidently
say
i
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
i
will
state
however
that
the
price
is
pushing
it
but
for
being
such
a
unique
brew
and
one
that
hides
the
alcohol
so
well
it
is
really
worth
it
try
this
if
you
can
it
is
worth
the
money
da
ridiculously
enjoyable
beer
way
more
complex
than
any
other
fruit
beer
ive
had
most
are
onenote
fruit
bombs
this
one
has
the
fruit
bomb
character
but
also
some
nice
chocolate
with
a
slight
bitter
character
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
i
dont
however
get
any
of
the
belgian
yeast
character
o
at
13
99
a
bottle
its
not
as
bad
as
in
some
places
here
and
after
trying
it
i
went
back
to
the
store
for
more
this
is
also
a
fairly
versatile
beer
as
it
would
pair
exceptionally
well
with
a
rich
chocolate
cake
think
flourless
or
even
just
some
dark
chocolate
also
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
on
its
own
o
a
greate
brew
nice
fruit
flavor
and
just
sweet
enough
that
i
can
finish
the
bomber
without
feeling
ill
highly
recommend
o
not
a
perfect
beer
but
they
hit
the
mark
they
were
aiming
for
it
is
really
good
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
cheers
overall
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
release
i
expected
it
to
be
good
but
im
not
usually
a
really
huge
fan
of
nonsour
fruit
beers
as
usual
founders
delivers
its
pricey
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
one
for
sure
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
note
that
its
alcohol
content
according
to
the
label
is
9
2
not
12
3
overall
i
would
seek
this
out
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
pay
19
99
for
a
750
again
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
an
awesome
one
o
usually
i
am
not
a
fan
of
flavored
or
sweet
beer
great
beer
just
a
little
sweet
for
me
still
delicious
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
d
a
very
tasty
savory
type
of
beer
refreshing
despite
the
9
2
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
totally
hidden
a
unique
quality
that
i
have
learned
to
love
from
founders
overall
an
impressive
raspberry
strong
i
heard
the
description
and
now
i
believe
it
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
great
lakes
christmas
ale
wine
glass
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
thick
pink
head
nose
is
all
raspberries
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
behind
it
taste
is
sweet
raspberries
up
front
with
a
tartness
at
the
finish
that
really
balances
it
out
and
keeps
it
from
being
the
least
bit
cloying
really
well
done
balance
of
sweettart
some
strong
malt
flavors
as
well
very
faint
alcohol
taste
nothing
to
complain
about
in
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
winner
its
a
big
burly
fruit
beer
with
a
high
abv
and
perfectly
balanced
this
might
bump
belgian
red
out
of
my
top
spot
need
to
have
it
some
more
first
well
done
founders
going
into
this
beer
i
assumed
it
would
be
something
of
an
imperial
raspberry
tart
there
are
definite
similarities
between
the
two
beers
and
while
i
prefer
new
glarus
take
i
have
to
remind
myself
that
blushing
monks
abv
is
over
twice
as
high
from
a
purely
technical
standpoint
thats
pretty
impressive
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
this
often
or
in
mass
quantities
but
its
excellent
for
what
it
is
750
ml
bottle
2011
vintage
served
in
a
flute
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
redpurple
color
with
about
a
half
inch
dark
pink
head
that
went
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
fresh
sweet
raspberries
raspberry
jam
and
a
bit
of
tart
raspberries
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
mostly
like
sweet
raspberries
and
raspberry
jam
along
with
some
tart
raspberry
too
also
theres
a
little
bit
of
bready
yeastiness
noticable
but
this
beer
is
definitely
all
about
the
raspberries
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
its
certainly
one
of
if
not
the
best
raspberry
beers
ive
ever
had
even
at
14
99
a
bottle
id
definitely
buy
this
again
in
the
future
i
thought
it
was
worth
the
money
o
this
is
a
well
executed
and
unique
fruit
beer
it
does
a
great
job
of
putting
raspberries
on
a
pedestal
while
still
retaining
qualities
of
a
belgian
style
ale
like
raspberry
soda
medium
to
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
on
the
palate
easy
drinking
bright
raspberry
from
start
to
finish
sweet
it
is
a
truly
amazing
beer
i
just
had
a
thought
maybe
i
should
do
a
side
by
side
with
raspberry
tart
to
compare
the
two
another
good
beer
from
founders
o
it
pains
me
to
have
such
a
meh
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
but
such
is
life
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
so
completely
onedimensional
and
lacking
in
complexity
that
i
could
never
call
it
good
add
onto
that
the
fact
that
its
very
expensive
15
for
my
bottle
and
you
have
an
allaround
disappointing
beer
d
the
cloying
sweetness
and
heavy
mouthfeel
massively
damages
the
overall
drinkability
o
a
wonderful
fruit
beer
that
is
pretty
and
delicious
well
done
yet
again
founders
overall
very
impressive
and
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
more
than
cerise
never
tried
rübæus
however
despite
the
gorgeous
look
tantalizing
aroma
and
strong
taste
it
is
ultimately
too
far
outside
the
realm
of
beer
even
sour
ales
seem
more
like
beer
to
me
to
want
to
seek
this
out
again
so
i
am
only
giving
it
a
4
for
overall
overall
i
wasnt
exactly
impressed
with
this
beer
there
was
a
lot
of
hype
about
founders
releasing
this
beer
again
as
part
of
there
limitied
edition
series
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
most
other
founders
beers
but
not
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
medium
bodied
with
a
great
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
something
that
helps
change
things
up
from
the
normal
offerings
and
im
definitely
glad
i
picked
this
up
will
be
looking
to
score
another
bottle
if
possible
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
fruit
beer
i
really
loved
the
sweetness
of
the
raspberries
in
the
taste
i
wish
the
nose
had
been
a
little
bit
stronger
and
sweeter
and
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
a
little
bit
less
as
that
would
have
made
it
almost
perfect
in
any
event
a
great
beer
i
would
love
to
have
again
my
girlfriend
loved
it
too
and
im
quite
glas
i
have
another
bottle
of
it
i
cannot
believe
that
this
is
9
it
just
drinks
like
juice
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
rubeas
and
framboise
an
excellent
drink
but
your
wifegirlfriend
will
think
it
is
amazing
overall
its
nice
to
meet
a
fruit
beer
that
doesnt
try
to
be
refreshing
and
light
this
is
an
fruit
beer
for
people
who
cant
stand
wheat
with
their
fruit
its
heavy
sweet
and
tart
without
ever
being
overbearing
truly
a
firstclass
fruit
beer
odthis
beer
delivered
for
me
not
only
did
i
really
enjoy
the
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
more
attractive
looking
brews
i
have
come
across
so
far
i
love
raspberries
now
i
love
this
beer
founders
is
just
allergic
to
making
bad
beer
applause
o
a
great
example
of
a
fruity
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
this
is
a
good
one
to
share
with
your
lady
friend
founders
does
not
fail
to
impress
here
d
deliciously
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
hidden
well
here
no
overwhelming
alcoholic
nose
or
taste
though
you
definitely
know
its
there
very
enjoyable
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
from
downtown
wine
and
spirits
tonight
in
somerville
i
passed
on
this
beer
the
last
time
it
was
out
because
of
the
high
price
tag
but
now
that
i
can
afford
it
i
am
game
pours
out
a
nice
reddish
pink
with
a
finger
of
whitepink
heading
the
nose
is
of
fresh
raspberries
and
that
is
about
it
not
artificial
smelling
either
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
raspberries
and
again
that
is
about
it
for
me
but
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
by
any
means
medium
mouthfeel
and
the
alcohol
is
not
present
at
all
it
appears
that
they
dialed
it
back
a
few
notches
with
this
batch
which
is
fine
by
me
my
final
thoughts
are
that
this
beer
is
delicious
and
needs
to
be
paired
with
some
kind
of
dark
chocolate
dessert
dark
ruby
brew
fine
bubbles
delicious
tangy
raspberry
aroma
with
an
earthy
leaf
must
underlying
tart
and
extreme
raspberry
incredible
lack
of
any
alcohol
heat
given
the
greater
than
12
abv
brett
provides
a
mushroomy
flavor
a
rich
maltiness
and
slick
and
sticky
mouthfeel
truly
a
unique
and
fabulous
brew
i
can
see
this
definitely
creeping
up
on
a
person
during
the
course
of
an
evening
it
was
probably
in
the
publics
best
interest
to
retire
this
one
dthis
is
very
artificial
and
syrupy
in
the
flavor
it
is
straight
forward
and
simple
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
drinkability
even
with
the
beer
being
a
little
flat
i
enjoyed
every
sip
and
could
have
drank
a
couple
bombers
of
this
beer
deep
cherry
red
pour
nose
is
heavy
sweet
honey
berries
vanilla
tons
of
vanilla
in
the
mouth
with
a
full
raspberry
but
not
really
all
that
enjoyable
sort
of
cloying
and
heavily
sweet
maybe
a
touch
of
sourness
or
acid
difficult
bottle
is
a
couple
years
old
at
least
im
not
really
sure
this
has
improved
or
will
improve
more
heavy
sticky
berry
sweetness
wow
this
is
really
tasty
very
delicious
great
flavor
this
is
like
liquid
raspberries
with
alcohol
very
nice
feel
with
good
carbonation
and
a
body
that
falls
just
light
of
medium
the
drinkability
is
insanely
high
i
would
love
to
drink
this
whole
bottom
myself
this
beer
appears
a
ruby
red
color
there
is
a
small
head
that
recedes
rapidly
leaving
virtually
no
lacing
on
the
glass
raspberry
jam
raspberry
pie
and
just
about
anything
raspberry
there
is
no
shortage
of
raspberries
here
the
beer
tastes
very
good
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
behind
an
armada
of
pungent
raspberries
its
a
bit
too
sweet
to
enjoy
more
than
a
few
ounces
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
id
certainly
have
it
again
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
and
carbonation
is
above
average
drinkability
is
good
its
a
great
fruit
beer
that
showcases
the
raspberry
flavor
beautifully
if
you
like
raspberries
chances
are
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
only
criticism
is
that
it
was
pretty
sweet
overall
it
could
have
used
some
tartness
to
balance
it
out
a
bit
if
it
were
to
challenge
ngs
raspberry
tart
for
my
favorite
raspberry
beer
overall
love
this
beer
i
hope
the
rumors
are
correct
that
it
will
be
rereleased
in
4packs
taste
is
amazing
its
sweet
and
fruity
so
tasty
and
drinkable
i
love
it
the
carbonation
is
very
light
and
drinkable
its
totally
worth
selling
out
d
hard
to
say
for
12
30
its
pretty
good
but
the
alcohol
does
work
to
kill
it
at
the
end
as
well
as
the
subpar
taste
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
this
is
ok
but
nothing
special
its
not
a
true
fruit
beer
to
me
not
enough
fruit
with
too
much
alcohol
if
you
want
to
crush
a
12
real
quick
and
get
slammed
this
might
do
the
trick
i
want
more
please
hit
me
up
if
you
have
some
to
trade
overall
a
very
good
fruit
beer
i
didnt
enjoy
it
quite
as
much
as
the
new
glarus
but
definitely
worth
giving
it
a
try
if
you
can
still
find
it
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
pink
raspberry
color
it
pours
nicely
into
a
wine
glass
of
a
tulip
glass
the
texture
is
light
with
good
carbonation
and
a
sweet
raspberry
nose
despite
its
alcohol
content
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
abv
while
drinking
it
i
have
bought
this
beer
at
many
different
places
around
philadelphia
before
its
extinction
eulogy
where
i
currently
work
cappones
the
foodery
south
philly
taproom
if
anyone
wants
to
trade
this
beer
for
something
please
let
me
know
this
one
is
a
miss
the
new
glarus
version
is
vastly
superior
pours
deep
dark
ruby
red
with
a
pinkish
tinged
head
smells
like
fresh
raspberries
which
is
surprising
given
the
age
of
the
bottle
the
fresh
smell
and
taste
really
surprised
me
given
how
old
this
is
the
taste
is
more
fresh
raspberries
very
sweet
bready
malt
as
well
kind
of
has
a
belgiany
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
warming
and
medium
bodied
comforting
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
though
good
drinkability
especially
for
a
high
alcohol
content
fruit
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
while
a
few
bottles
were
still
left
around
a
shame
that
its
no
longer
in
production
this
beer
is
a
real
shiner
for
what
a
raspberry
lambic
can
be
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
defintiely
to
be
enjoyed
shared
with
others
overall
a
great
beer
i
have
a
feeling
it
is
slightly
past
its
prime
i
would
have
liked
a
tarter
character
in
the
taste
but
the
alcohol
has
all
but
disappeared
completely
which
is
a
plus
great
stuff
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
raspberry
nose
hides
the
12
3
abv
the
taste
is
sweet
brewed
raspberries
poured
a
brownishred
light
lacing
an
awesome
specialty
from
founders
and
it
was
a
treat
to
remember
its
beauty
solid
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
drinkability
an
interesting
brew
that
its
unfortunate
to
see
retired
the
belgian
thing
almost
works
well
with
the
raspberries
and
the
raspberries
themselves
are
fantastic
oh
and
the
alcohol
is
absolutely
nonexistent
only
poking
its
head
through
in
very
rare
instances
also
my
girlfriend
absolutely
loved
it
which
is
something
i
can
pretty
much
say
about
only
one
other
beer
weve
ever
tried
together
and
ive
made
her
try
a
lot
so
definitely
recommended
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
it
did
not
taste
artificial
i
found
the
sweet
and
tart
raspberry
flavors
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
picks
d
deliciously
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
hidden
well
here
no
overwhelming
alcoholic
nose
or
taste
though
you
definitely
know
its
there
enjoyable
if
you
like
lindemans
fruit
lambics
as
it
is
not
as
sweet
but
with
a
similar
style
taste
d
drinkability
is
good
for
a
12
3
raspberry
bomb
its
simple
but
i
think
thats
what
founders
is
going
for
with
the
blushing
monk
it
goes
down
quite
easy
given
the
abv
actually
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
pinpoint
which
is
pretty
shocking
for
a
beer
of
this
stature
a
good
idea
might
be
to
share
this
brew
a
bomber
might
be
a
bit
much
in
a
session
for
one
person
but
id
sure
be
happy
trying
to
put
one
away
myself
another
fine
brew
from
founders
founders
did
a
nice
job
overall
with
blushing
monk
personally
i
prefer
this
to
their
other
fruit
beers
yeah
its
somewhat
one
dimensional
but
theres
enough
flavor
to
score
pretty
well
it
does
have
a
nice
taste
founders
did
a
really
nice
job
with
the
alcohol
in
this
one
youd
never
guess
its
over
12
for
a
fruit
beer
its
good
stuff
if
youre
into
the
style
youll
probably
really
like
it
if
youre
like
me
and
have
a
tough
time
getting
into
the
style
you
might
just
be
surprised
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
have
the
opportunity
nb
much
better
than
rubaeus
that
one
is
a
bit
watery
d
great
pre
or
post
meal
sipper
a
truly
wonderful
experience
from
top
to
bottom
abv
completely
hidden
medium
bodied
yet
crisp
and
relatively
clean
finishes
slightly
dry
a
really
nice
beer
i
really
loved
rubaeus
and
this
was
no
let
down
either
the
raspberry
flavor
really
shines
as
it
should
and
this
one
is
a
real
easy
drinker
drinkability
as
much
like
a
fruity
wine
as
it
is
a
potent
brew
not
much
in
the
way
of
grain
hops
the
basic
beer
components
a
fine
dessert
beer
or
evening
apertif
the
strength
and
tartness
of
the
beer
keep
it
at
a
sipping
level
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
split
this
with
my
girlfriend
who
also
liked
it
if
you
are
into
fruit
beers
i
recommend
this
it
will
not
stun
you
with
complexity
but
there
is
enough
going
on
to
keep
up
the
interest
overall
a
tasty
brew
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
the
body
is
moderate
and
surprisingly
so
clean
for
the
abv
the
carbonation
is
light
but
does
allow
the
raspberry
to
come
out
more
just
have
to
say
it
again
very
clean
overall
a
great
fruit
beer
and
no
its
not
an
oxymoron
this
is
much
too
easy
to
drink
especially
for
a
12
brew
enjoy
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
this
is
yet
another
excellent
brew
from
the
guys
over
at
founders
im
not
all
that
into
fruit
beers
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
fruit
beers
can
and
should
be
awesome
taste
not
quite
as
thick
as
raspberry
tart
it
tastes
about
the
same
but
seems
like
more
belgian
and
less
raspberry
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
run
across
strong
aroma
a
bitterness
hits
after
the
sweet
medium
body
could
drink
a
bottle
of
this
for
desert
seems
like
a
really
good
mix
and
belgian
and
raspberry
great
level
of
carbonation
picked
this
up
at
the
beer
stop
in
west
hazleton
for
15
i
had
this
bottle
quietly
aging
away
for
about
a
year

on
the

that
what
is
written
here
somewhere
around

irc
poured
from
a
22

bottle
into
my
maredsous
chalice
appears
a
hazy
ruby

with
a
pinkish
hue
and
about
two
fingers
of

and
tastes
of
what
else
fresh
raspberries
notes
of
raspberry
jam

raspberry
jello
raspberry

sweet
n
sour

medium
in

carbonation
extremely
drinkably
especially
after
about
a
year
in
the
bottle
the
alcohol
is
just
about
nonexistent
this
one
goes
down
very
well
sure
its
pricey
but
imho
worth
the
for
a
once
a
year
treat
lets
hope
this
one
comes
back
around
but
im
not
holding
my
breath
since
rubeaus
has
been
put
on
hiatus
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
its

carobonated

natural
sugars
pours
a
beautiful
rich
ruby
color
not
much
of

a

sticky

mild

strong
smell
of
fresh
raspberries
and
a
little
heat
on
the
tail
robust
flavor
of
raspberries
with
some
wine
qualities
light
texture
and
body
goes
down
smooth
with
some
lingering
bitterness
this
is
delicious
great
drinkability
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
hint

carbonation
very
nice
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
thin
fizzy
light
pink
head
that
quikly
fades
nice
funky
aroma
with
pleasant
raspberry

overpowering
excellent
balance
of
sour
and

with
a
slight

by
slightly

very
quaffable
and
not
acidic
at
all
with
a
dry
finish
if
you
spot
this
while
beer
shopping
and
have
not
had
this
yet
and
like
fruit
beers
buy
this
immediatly
you
will
thank
me
later
i
recently
heard
that
founders
is
discontinuing
rubeaus
do
to
the
cost
of
raspberrys
so
i
dont
see
blushing
monk
being
brewed
again
any
time
soon
which
is
sad
drank
alright
the
tartness
dryness
hold
me
back
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
of
an
imperial
version
of
new
galrus
raspberry
tart
sometimes
less
is
more
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
pair
with
foods
my
wife
would
love
this
but
shes
been
asleep
for
an
hour
here
loss
will
save
her
some
maybe
cheers
to
you
jimmy
j
for
bringing
this
one
pours
the
true
color
of
raspberries
and
slightly
cloudy
with
a
wispy
head
thats
gone
in
a
flash
looks
and
smells
like
a
wine
except
for
the
spotty
pattern
of
belgian
lacing
the
aroma
is
amazing
well
balanced
between
the
natural
sweetness
and
tart
characteristics
of
the
berry
the
mouth
feel
is
light
yet
has
the
stature
to
carry
the
flavors
on
well
past
a
sip
full
raspberry
taste
tart
but
well
within
a
satisfying
tolerance
this
bottle
is
labelled
12
3
abv
and
it
is
well
integrated
this
alcohol
presents
some
warming
but
it
is
hidden
by
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
and
complexity
of
the
mouth
a
really
nice
drinker
highly
recommended

i
wasnt
expecting
this
at
all
very
very
sweet
and
tasty
raspberry
as
for
drinking
more
than
one
no
way
beside
the
price
i
think
its
too
sweet
to
make
it
a
regular
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
dam
near
perfect
its
not
to
full
bodied
but
isnt
exactly
medium
bodied
either
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
check
by
tartness
this
was
a
pleasure
from
start
to
finish
this
is
what
i
wished
dfh
fort
was
like
d
pretty
low
not
extremely
sweet
for
the
style
but
it
becomes
too
much
abv
is
pretty
damn
high
too
the
remainder
of
this
bottle
will
have
to
be
blended
with
something
else
to
finish
it
though
taste
very
tart
fruity
and
refreshing
this
is
the
most
alcoholic
beer
ive
drank
but
the
alcohol
isnt
really
noticable
this
is
what
every
other
raspberry
beer
aspires
to
be
drinkability
excellent
an
impressive
sumptuous
brew
that
delivers
tons
of
great
flavors
and
a
punchy
alcohol
percentage
yet
it
remains
very
very
drinkable
its
no
dogfish
head
fort
thankfully
love
me
some
blushing
monk
d
a
little
cloying
and
tart
for
me
fun
to
try
once
though
from
a
brown
22oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
very
pretty
smells
of
tarty
raspberries
below
average
carbonation
first
sip
is
tart
and
bitter
with
the
raspberries
leading
the
way
other
fruits
could
include
pears
and
grapes
super
fruity
not
too
sour
very
nice
the
12
3
is
well
hidden
hv
this
is
certainly
not
something
i
would
drink
with
any
regularity
and
in
fact
i
would
probably
share
a
bottle
next
time
but
this
is
really
an
impressive
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
poured
into
a
smuttynose
big
beer
tulip
reddish
brown
slightly
hazy
appearance
white
bubbly
head
quickly
disipates
to
a
slick
with
ring
of
bubbles
when
shaken
up
and
swirled
halfway
through
the
head
comes
back
but
it
is
more
foamy
than
at
first
smells
like
raspberries
raspberries
raspberries
at
first
this
is
all
i
can
smell
and
i
can
smell
it
from
acroos
the
room
after
a
bit
some
alcoholic
sweetness
pokes
into
the
nose
and
almost
a
banana
scent
as
it
warms
more
the
cloying
sweetness
becomes
more
pronounced
tastes
like
raspberries
and
a
bit
of
tartness
this
is
definitly
more
sweet
than
tart
has
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
at
first
upon
a
bit
of
swiling
the
bubbly
mouthfeel
moves
toward
a
thick
syrupy
sweeter
mouthfeel
as
this
warms
up
the
alcohol
which
was
previously
well
hidden
starts
to
become
barely
evident
especially
deep
in
the
nose
overall
i
think
this
has
too
much
fruit
sweetness
for
what
it
is
not
an
easy
drinker
for
me
tastes
like
fresh
rasberries
and
it
is
very
refreshing
i
have
no
idea
that
this
beer
is
high
octane
masks
it
wonderfully
good
crisp
mouthfeel
not
as
syruppy
as
i
would
expect
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
a
fruity
beer
as
well
d
very
drinkable
tastes
like
spiked
punch
but
not
very
many
identifiable
beerlike
qualities
i
got
a
little
bit
of
wheaty
berliner
weiss
flavor
somewhere
in
there
but
not
very
evident
a
good
drink
but
not
a
great
beer
massively
overpriced
trying
rubaus
soon
overall
not
as
good
as
a
rubeaus
and
not
worth
the
money
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
unique
beer
imho
but
this
is
one
of
those
one
bottle
per
session
beers
despite
the
great
flavor
quite
an
interesting
beer
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
of
a
case
but
certainly
as
a
single
bottle
purchase
thin
head
settled
quickly
darker
red
than
the
rubaeus
more
like
a
raw
cranberry
juice
the
aroma
was
pretty
heady
i
thought
a
strong
black
cherry
smell
that
gave
way
to
a
yeasty
odour
and
then
a
pink
grapefruit
flush
the
taste
was
balanced
and
pleasant
with
tart
over
ripe
fruit
muted
acidity
and
teasing
tartness
counter
balanced
with
the
sweetness
of
a
european
honey
both
this
and
the
rubaeus
are
raspberrybased
and
this
is
like
the
higheralcohol
big
brother
to
it
with
a
more
substantial
mouthfeel
and
texture
the
only
slight
distraction
i
thought
was
a
more
abrupt
after
taste
possibly
the
malt
following
on
the
heels
of
a
very
pronounced
raspberrybeer
experience
the
high
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
over
12
highly
recommended
i
was
impressed
by
the
founders
rübæus
but
this
is
something
else
i
dont
believe
ive
ever
tasted
a
fruit
beer
quite
like
this
granted
i
cant
exclude
fruitlambics
which
are
another
thing
altogether
but
this
too
is
special
enough
to
be
put
in
a
category
of
its
own
at
12
3
blushing
monk
is
an
incredibly
unique
beer
one
which
will
stand
out
in
my
memory
for
some
time
drinkability
superb
sipperaperitif
if
you
like
raspberries
grab
a
few
friends
and
crack
one
highly
recommended
sweet
fruit
beer
expensive
to
be
sure
but
its
not
often
you
see
a
brewery
nail
a
beer
like
this
find
it
try
it
note
the
2011
bottling
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
original
quite
enjoyable
as
an
occassional
sipper
very
natural
feel
to
this
early
gateway
to
more
funky
lambics
founders
has
every
right
to
be
proud
of
blushing
monk
theyve
nailed
the
essence
of
a
big
raspberry
fruit
beer
and
theyve
picked
the
perfect
name
considering
the
appearance
and
the
ingredients
this
isnt
a
beer
that
id
drink
often
especially
at
15
39
per
bomber
but
its
a
delicious
treat
that
will
ease
me
into
the
evening
with
style
wonderful
and
it
belongs
up
there
with
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
from
new
glarus
it
is
dangerously
dangerously
drinkable
i
had
to
triple
check
the
abv
dthis
is
12
3
your
kidding
a
great
sipper
for
sure
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
to
a
wine
aperitif
a
truly
well
done
brew
certainly
not
for
everyone
but
for
those
that
like
raspberries
wonderful
a
short
lived
one
three
finger
head
is
almost
pink
in
color
which
i
found
quite
appropriate
for
the
style
body
is
a
very
deep
burgundy
nose
is
full
of
purreed
raspberries
rugbarb
and
a
prequil
of
sweet
tartness
a
long
creamy
tartness
is
actually
silky
as
you
take
first
sip
a
minerally
vegetable
laced
sweet
and
sour
battle
ingages
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
has
been
called
a
bigger
version
of
rubeaus
but
this
really
is
its
own
unique
brew
twords
the
end
of
the
palate
you
get
a
distinct
bit
of
dryness
that
really
balances
out
the
tartness
there
really
is
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
within
the
palate
of
this
beer
alchol
is
completely
hidden
mouthfeel
is
fruity
dry
thick
tartness
an
exceptionally
drinkable
sipper
tasted
a
lot
like
a
framboise
to
me
still
pretty
tasty
for
a
fruit
beer
with
that
much
alcohol
interesting
brew
and
would
not
necessarily
expect
this
from
founders
would
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
recommended
drinkability
is
good
the
fruit
is
very
prominent
without
being
overly
sweet
theres
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
to
help
balance
things
out
but
not
too
much
the
alcohol
is
mostly
hidden
aside
from
the
pleasant
warming
that
starts
on
the
way
down
and
spreads
outward
from
there
a
great
dessert
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
beer
geeks
and
nongeeks
alike
d
the
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
the
beer
is
a
good
sipper
that
veers
dangerously
close
to
cloying
but
never
quite
gets
there
founders
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
pours
a
raspberry
red
in
color
with
some
nice
carbonation
bubbles
filling
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
tart
raspberries
taste
is
much
the
same
amazing
enough
i
didnt
tire
of
it
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
you
get
no
hints
of
the
12
3
abv
this
was
a
real
treat
d
definitely
a
desert
beer
for
the
12
percent
alcohol
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
it
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
raspberry
tart
but
its
hard
to
hold
that
against
it
beer
is
good
happy
beering
drinkability
well
for
what
it
is
it
is
easy
to
drink
this
would
make
a
good
sunday
brunch
beverage
or
something
to
use
for
a
toast
on
new
years
eve
or
a
celebration
of
some
sort
but
beyond
that
i
could
not
see
this
as
a
beer
to
settle
down
and
drink
for
an
evening
mainly
because
it
does
not
taste
like
beer
d
a
little
tasty
especially
if
youre
into
the
raspberry
flavor
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
strong
kick
this
just
is
not
my
type
of
beer
particularly
since
i
could
see
too
much
in
the
way
of
beer
characteristics
through
the
intense
raspberry
flavor
i
do
think
that
the
price
for
the
bomber
is
a
little
high
but
it
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
good
but
a
little
can
go
a
long
way
for
most
tasters
minus
the
very
miniscule
island
of
foam
this
beer
looks
like
wine
merlot
and
grape
juice
with
a
little
it
o
sediment
at
the
bottom
no
bubbling
no
lacing
and
no
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
lots
of
rasberries
a
few
currants
and
even
some
wine
grapes
the
taste
is
a
pretty
complex
rasberry
with
lots
of
other
very
lightly
tart
fruits
the
palate
is
very
juicey
and
msweet
not
overpowering
great
after
dinner
beverage
only
mildly
warming
cosidering
the
alcohol
pours
a
beautiful
translucent
ruby
red
but
with
no
head
intense
raspberry
aromaswith
a
bitter
backbone
that
smells
a
little
seedy
a
little
hot
as
well
there
is
a
slight
but
haunting
aroma
of
roses
as
well
the
taste
is
more
mellow
and
integrated
more
roses
heavy
flavors
of
fresh
raspberries
and
a
background
herbal
quality
i
like
it
but
i
can
see
how
it
wouldnt
be
everybodys
cup
of
tea
the
mouthfeel
is
tart
but
not
too
much
so
quite
a
big
beer
and
it
shows
but
i
think
its
interesting
enough
to
warrant
exploring
this
one
a
few
more
times
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
with
a
one
finger
hazy
pink
colored
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
very
spotty
lacing
smell
is
a
spicy
fruit
but
not
necessarily
raspberries
strawberries
sour
cherries
and
blueberries
all
fill
the
nose
sour
wine
aromas
make
a
strong
presence
there
is
a
pretty
obvious
alcohol
smell
too
sweet
syrupy
raspberries
up
front
followed
by
a
sour
bite
some
pepper
and
a
faint
wood
flavor
emerge
as
well
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
with
a
sour
apple
like
sting
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
body
with
a
steady
carbonation
nothing
too
outstanding
about
this
brew
but
definitely
worth
a
try
blushing
monk
falls
into
that
wondorous
category
that
borders
flemish
red
sour
ale
and
fruit
ale
a
delicious
beer
that
pours
with
a
reddishburgandy
color
this
brew
does
not
disappoint
a
unique
offering
from
a
brewey
that
consistenly
pushes
the
inner
envelope
of
craft
brewing
pours
a
reddishpinkish
hue
with
a
very
small
pink
head
nose
is
definitely
raspberries
nice
and
full
edge
flavor
is
definitely
fruity
and
full
of
raspberries
but
this
tastes
like
koolaid
with
alcohol
in
it
to
me
a
bit
too
one
sided
with
not
a
lot
of
complexity
to
it
the
feel
has
a
great
level
of
carbonation
that
just
soothes
the
mouth
overall
though
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
no
complexity
and
too
much
koolaidness
id
pass
on
this
next
time
i
think
served
chilled
in
a
tulip
glass
from
a
twentytwo
ounce
brown
bottle
poured
a
beautiful
cranberry
red
color
almost
an
inch
of
soapy
bubbly
pinkish
red
colored
head
formed
pretty
quickly
faded
into
a
small
ring
in
the
glass
it
did
leave
small
spots
of
thin
lace
on
the
glass
a
big
nose
full
of
raspberries
and
plenty
of
dry
alcohol
almost
chambord
like
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
tons
of
thick
fresh
raspberry
flavors
sugary
sweet
with
almost
mouth
puckering
sourness
finishes
rather
smooth
with
quite
a
bit
of
throat
and
body
warming
alcohol
and
pretty
dry
has
a
nice
full
bodied
smooth
mouthfeel
plenty
of
tingly
carbonation
felt
on
the
tongue
pretty
good
drinkability
but
i
choose
to
enjoy
it
sip
by
sip
pretty
damn
good
in
my
opinion
didnt
know
what
to
expect
coming
into
this
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
decent
drinkability
a
bomber
is
honestly
a
bit
much
but
its
very
tasty
i
dont
know
how
blegian
it
is
though
deep
pinky
red
color
reminds
me
of
the
old
dessert
1
2
3
and
the
shades
of
red
that
were
in
it
very
carbonated
but
not
much
head
huge
rasberry
and
tartsour
aroma
blast
of
fruit
and
rasberries
up
front
great
sourness
and
slightly
sweet
as
well
very
well
done
between
the
2
tastes
the
sour
bite
is
really
really
great
almsot
seems
an
alcohol
bite
but
i
dont
think
so
very
bright
and
lively
mouthfeel
rather
thin
and
quaffable
fantastic
all
around
could
do
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
often
right
up
there
with
new
glaruswhich
i
lovefor
me
a
very
poor
effort
from
this
otherwise
outstanding
brewery
a
beer
to
avoid
imho
this
is
a
smooth
fruit
beer
but
also
noticeably
boozy
its
basically
the
rubeaus
on
steroids
at
12
3
abv
its
not
exactly
easy
sippin
and
theres
really
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
to
balance
things
out
still
its
tasty
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
folks
at
founders
dont
do
bad
beers
and
this
is
another
good
one
the
strong
rasberry
scent
of
this
ale
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
nice
change
from
the
candy
quality
of
so
many
fruity
lambics
the
color
is
a
deep
pink
a
mix
between
magenta
and
ruby
the
blush
of
the
blushing
monk
very
small
head
the
taste
is
clean
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
too
sweet
with
a
dry
quality
very
reminiscent
of
a
rich
red
wine
the
flavor
was
full
enough
to
hide
the
strong
abv
i
sampled
this
beer
at
extreme
beer
fest
2006
and
had
been
searching
for
it
since
i
took
a
beer
break
for
the
past
few
months
and
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
given
my
palates
complete
cleansing
this
is
almost
like
drinking
raspberry
koolaid
but
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
pours
a
slightly
hazed
ruby
redmaroon
nice
colour
thin
pinkish
head
forms
settles
to
a
thin
layer
leaves
some
nice
lace
rings
smell
is
raspberries
fruits
toast
sour
and
tart
blackberry
seeds
bread
grains
nice
taste
is
sweet
berries
raspberry
caramel
very
fresh
taste
alcohol
is
non
existant
sugary
and
fruity
finish
but
with
a
tart
and
bitter
berry
seed
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
bit
of
warmth
comes
across
very
nice
fruit
beer
nice
complexity
highly
recommended
just
dont
expect
anything
belgian
and
if
youre
a
utilitarian
rubeaus
wins
out
but
dont
pass
this
one
up
overall
thanks
faro
for
yet
another
great
beer
my
wife
sends
her
thanks
as
well
this
beer
is
great
fruit
beers
are
fun
and
never
boring
good
beer
to
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
one
too
often
overall
another
wonderful
founders
brew
tons
of
raspberry
flavor
that
keeps
you
running
back
for
more
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
just
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
1
bottle
i
split
this
bottle
with
surlysober
where
he
got
it
i
dont
know
drinkability
why
dont
they
bottle
stuff
like
this
in
a
12
oz
bottle
it
would
be
quite
hard
to
open
one
of
these
22s
and
finish
it
by
yourself
at
15
99
and
with
it
being
so
limited
i
wasnt
thoroughly
impressed
but
it
was
worth
trying
this
is
a
surefire
dessert
beer
ill
stick
with
the
rubaeus
from
now
on
d
this
is
scary
its
as
easy
to
drink
as
the
ruebaus
but
is
twice
as
strong
it
sticks
to
raspberry
and
doesnt
seem
to
explore
a
whole
lot
but
it
is
very
good
at
what
it
is
appearance
is
a
maroon
purple
color
a
finger
of
big
bubbled
head
that
vanishes
quickly
interesting
color
although
no
real
lacing
nose
is
crazy
spicy
raspberries
very
light
hint
of
sourness
flavor
is
solid
sour
raspberry
notes
but
not
as
strong
as
the
sweetness
alcohol
is
covered
up
really
well
and
grows
as
the
beer
warms
sourness
shows
up
at
the
end
winelike
although
very
sweet
a
nice
mix
of
random
dried
fruit
as
well
feel
is
excellent
crispy
biting
refreshing
high
carbonation
body
is
medium
maybe
a
little
thin
but
good
with
the
carbonation
overall
i
liked
this
one
although
its
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
standard
for
the
style
a
lot
like
a
sparkling
and
highly
alcoholic
raspberry
juice
a
superb
offering
certainly
didnt
taste
its
abv
if
you
love
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
and
high
abv
beers
and
i
do
you
will
love
this
beer
and
i
do
d
i
think
this
one
is
better
in
small
doses
i
always
loved
the
samples
i
had
at
the
great
taste
but
drinking
a
whole
22oz
was
a
little
tough
still
a
nice
tasty
fruit
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
brown
color
with
a
pink
head
that
is
rocky
and
builds
up
tall
on
the
glass
dies
down
to
leave
lacing
along
the
side
of
the
glass
and
a
ring
on
top
of
this
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
of
berries
and
more
fruit
in
the
background
taste
is
even
more
fruit
but
not
much
else
and
i
did
not
complain
absolutely
a
shock
coming
from
a
big
beer
anyone
that
says
they
dont
like
beer
give
them
this
and
it
might
blow
their
socks
off
this
does
not
taste
like
beer
pours
a
brilliant
light
crimson
with
a
frothy
pink
head
that
dies
to
a
ring
very
lively
carbonation
smells
of
huge
sweet
raspberries
and
raspberries
taste
is
awesome
juicy
fresh
raspberries
that
are
sweet
and
tart
makes
me
pucker
with
delight
medium
in
the
mouth
with
a
great
tickle
on
the
toungue
from
the
lively
carbonation
abv
is
absolutely
non
existant
this
beverage
is
an
abolute
delight

a
bottle
at

east
wowza
12

pours
a
crimson
lavender
with
a
huge
pink
tinged
white
head
dissipation
is
rapid
despite
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
aroma
is
boozy
and
very
powerful
consisting
mostly
of
raspberries
very
tart
and
boozy
flavor
of
raspberries
full
to
the
point
of
being
heavy
raspberry
flavor
is
out
of
this
world
but
its
one
dimensional
not
that
that
is
necessarily
bad
i
think
this
beer
is
exactly
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
its
really
quite
astounding
personally
however
i
am
not
very
happy
with
it
its
just
too
big
too
strong
and
too
much
of
a
good
thing
i
also
dont
like
that
the
body
at
least
to
me
seems
to
come
more
from
alcohol
then
from
raspberries
impressive
it
is
simply
for
being
so
big
and
so
fruity
but
i
really
did
not
enjoy
it
and
had
a
tough
time
finishing
the
bottle
even
with
a
little
help
d
it
is
a
great
beer
if
you
love
strong
raspberry
flavors
not
a
style
i
would
usually
spend
15
on
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
probably
not
one
i
would
get
again
nice
beer
to
watch
a
rugby
game

poured
into

a
full
rich
raspberry

with
a
hint
of
brown

it
a
lacy
pink
colored
head
atopwow
big
tart
raspberry
aromas
a
bit
of
sweet
alcohol
and
toast
as
well
tastes
like
the
raspberries
off
the
bush
i
used
to
eat
when
running
around
the
woods
of
central
mi
as
a
kid
very
tart
with
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
the
tartness
really
is
the
showthere
is
a
toasty
backbone
and
a
sticky
sweet
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
making
it
more
that
just
tart
raspberries
on
the
palate
the
best
fruit
beer
of
any
kind
i
have
had
i
had
rubeus
over
the
summer
and
this
is
a
double
version
of
thatkick
ass
beer
mouthfeel
is
like
a
sweet
tart
filled
with
fruity
jam
it
tickles
the
front
of
the
tongue
upon
the
sip
and
hits
the
rear
of
the
tongue
with
verocity
full
bodied
rich
chewy
yeasty
and
chocked
full
of
berries
22
oz
bottle
was
about
16
at
the
keg
in
clarksville
indiana
pours
a
slightly
hazed
garnet
body
with
a
small
and
soapy
pink
head
a
few
flecks
of
lace
are
left
on
the
goblet
aroma
is
earthy
yeasty
mushrooms
and
lots
of
raspberries
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
with
lots
of
tart
raspberries
and
some
earthy
yeast
alcohol
is
miraculously
hidden
except
for
a
slight
warmth
very
drinkable
for
such
a
large
fruit
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
soda
like
carbonation
good
beer
but
i
would
like
to
have
seen
some
malt
presence
to
counter
the
fruit
drinkability
this
is
very
good
ale
its
high
abv
alone
limits
sessionability
but
the
taste
is
more
of
sipper
than
a
session
beer
anyway
it
is
something
to
enjoy
with
dinner
or
dessert
drinkability
pretty
good
fruit
beer
jen
do
we
usually
pay
this
much
for
a
beer
no
would
i
buy
this
again
without
even
blinking
it
pours
out
a
nice
deep
magenta
color
with
little
foam
all
i
can
smell
is
raspberries
first
taste
is
quite
amazing
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
with
small
bubbles
the
ending
is
of
tart
raspberries
that
makes
the
alcohol
virtually
disappear
i
wouldnt
even
think
there
was
alcohol
in
it
except
that
equivalent
to
a
wine
cooler
i
both
want
to
savour
this
and
drink
it
in
one
big
gulp
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
even
nonbeer
drinkers
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
pink
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
raspberry
aroma
that
is
tart
and
almost
lambic
like
the
taste
is
perfect
it
has
a
smooth
and
refreshing
raspberry
taste
that
goes
down
so
easy
and
finishes
tart
its
refreshing
even
at
12
3
thats
quite
a
feat
this
is
what
i
was
hoping
fort
would
taste
like
these
guys
have
a
winner
here
there
is
such
a
tremendous
raspberry
presence
this
may
be
the
best
fruit
beer
ever
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
a
kick
ass
beer
and
great
drinker
cheers
felt
very
bubbly
in
the
mouth
nice
medium
body
tart
aftertaste
this
one
was
enjoyable
for
me
and
i
am
not
a
huge
fruity
beer
type
of
guy
drinkability
for
the
alcohol
percent
wow
the
acidity
is
a
bit
much
for
me
although
right
now
i
am
feeling
especially
acid
sensitive
so
i
am
going
to
disregard
the
acidity
and
the
price
is
quite
high
i
will
buy
it
again
d
this
beer
is
all
about
the
big
and
wonderful
taste
of
raspberries
with
some
nice
sweet
and
sugary
notes
that
support
the
tartness
it
drinks
very
smooth
for
a
beer
for
this
much
alcohol
the
belgian
yeast
adds
some
nice
subtle
flavors
that
enhance
the
sweetness
and
give
it
some
nice
depth
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
small
off
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
strong
raspberry
as
well
the
flavor
was
of
malt
raspberry
and
maybe
a
hint
of
anise
the
body
is
medium
light
yet
slightly
creamy
the
finish
is
tart
yet
a
touch
sweet
with
the
influence
of
the
raspberry
quite
apparent
the
warming
effect
of
the
alcohol
is
present
but
is
hidden
fairly
well
otherwise
not
much
for
fruit
styles
but
this
one
is
done
very
well
shared
growler
from
the
brewpub
pours
a
pinkish
ruby
color
with
a
medium
and
fluffy
white
head
with
decent
retention
strong
tart
raspberry
aroma
with
touches
of
citrus
mediumbodied
and
fizzy
with
a
very
strong
raspberry
flavor
that
mellows
pretty
quickly
unlike
most
tart
raspberry
beers
this
one
becomes
easier
to
drink
with
time
which
is
probably
due
to
the
maltyness
the
higher
than
usual
abv
is
wellhidden
too
the
finish
is
tart
raspberry
at
first
but
finishes
like
sweet
toffee
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
just
had
this
beer
the
other
day
at
the
brewery
in
grand
rapids
this
is
one
exceptional
beer
labeled
as
a
belgian
trippel
fermented
with
raspberries
and
the
abv
is
12
3
kind
of
a
champagne
type
mouth
feel
with
huge
amounts
of
raspberry
aroma
and
taste
you
would
never
know
that
this
beer
is
as
high
in
abv
as
it
is
indicated
because
is
it
is
dangerously
smooth
going
down
it
would
be
easy
to
call
this
a
chick
beer
because
of
the
flavor
but
i
would
venture
to
guess
that
even
the
biggest
of
beer
drinkers
would
have
a
short
night
after
a
couple
of
glasses
of
this
beer
that
being
said
this
beer
is
my
wifes
favorite
and
it
is
simply
delicious
for
a
fruit
beer
im
still
much
more
of
a
kbs
fan
but
this
is
a
nice
touch
to
drink
on
occasion
im
not
generally
a
big
fruit
beer
fan
but
this
one
is
no
ordinary
fruit
beer
highly
recommend
thats
right
this
serving
was
from
the
bottle
i
just
got
my
hands
on
a
limmited
22
oz
bottle
this
red
passion
poured
with
a
fizzy
head
that
was
gone
in
an
instant
the
smell
was
like
sweet
frozen
raspberry
lemonade
concentrate
you
get
at
the
grocerie
store
very
tart
no
alcohol
phenols
smell
present
mouthfeel
is
crisp
fizzy
but
thick
taste
is
great
big
raspberry
up
front
with
a
little
dry
almond
after
taste
drinkability
is
outstanding
you
could
easily
go
through
a
22ozer
yourself
i
think
i
just
might
do
that
d
this
is
criminally
drinkable
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
easy
the
alcohol
is
virtually
nonexistant
i
cant
figure
out
how
or
where
they
hid
it
its
like
drinking
a
3
54
lambic
amazing
very
clean
pour
with
an
excellent
rose
colored
head
very
sweet
beer
this
may
sound
stupid
but
this
reminded
me
of
my
childhood
and
i
kept
remembering
back
to
that
foamy
jello
stuff
i
dont
remeber
what
it
was
called
perfect
amount
of
carbination
overall
yet
another
great
job
by
founders
pours
a
murky
ruby
to
blood
in
color
with
a
bubble
gum
pink
head
that
builds
to
a
finger
and
then
recedes
to
nothing
quickly
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
raspberry
puree
along
with
a
lemony
tartness
taste
is
much
the
same
like
a
not
quite
ripe
tart
raspberry
there
is
some
raspberry
sweetness
underneath
that
slides
across
the
back
of
the
tongue
but
the
tartness
is
dominant
carbonation
at
first
is
a
bit
sparkling
with
a
crisp
effervescence
this
dies
down
as
it
warms
but
there
is
still
a
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
reminds
me
very
much
of
another
tart
raspberry
beer
except
for
the
alcohol
content
the
alcohol
on
the
chalkboard
at
the
pub
stated
10
3
and
it
is
almost
nonevident
very
well
hiddenbalanced
this
is
definitely
not
one
i
can
do
many
of
both
because
of
its
strength
and
its
strong
fruit
flavors
but
it
captures
the
essence
of
raspberries
very
well
and
was
a
nice
festive
one
to
have
after
belgian
waffles
this
holiday
morning
cant
wait
to
try
it
over
ice
cream
wow
amazing
brew
poured
out
to
a
deep
ruby
color
with
medium
low
carbonation
aroma
of
raspberries
and
malt
very
appealing
flavors
of
complex
berries
malt
a
hint
of
grain
and
husk
nice
mouthfeel
was
thicker
than
most
other
fruit
beers
but
wasnt
at
all
syrupy
or
overly
dense
drinkability
is
pretty
good
consitering
the
rather
high
abv
this
is
what
wed
get
if
rübæus
was
put
on
steroids
recommended
nice
thick
mouthfeel
the
high
acidity
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
raspberries
perfectly
could
drink
a
good
long
time
wow
this
beer
is
amazing
it
is
like
a
rasberry
lambic
times
100
it
pours
a
hazy
redish
pink
with
a
large
white
bubbly
head
smells
intensly
of
rasberrys
and
yummy
sweetness
the
taste
is
amazing
stronger
than
a
lambic
but
so
good
it
has
a
somewhat
sour
or
tart
aftertaste
but
the
rasberry
comes
through
the
strongest
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
fresh
very
light
this
is
a
wonderful
offering
at
founders
and
should
be
tried
by
all
enjoy
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
stuff
was
easy
to
quaff
and
very
tasty
i
like
the
body
and
flavour
both
of
which
are
noticeable
improvements
on
the
standard
lambic
flavour
in
general
and
the
rubaeus
offering
from
founders
in
particular
i
hope
they
start
bottling
this
stuff
soon
this
would
be
a
seriously
dangerous
summer
beer
because
it
goes
down
so
easily
this
beer
was
a
little
expensive
at
5
00
for
an
8
ounce
glass
but
it
was
worth
it
it
had
a
nice
ruby
red
color
and
a
great
aroma
of
raspberries
it
had
a
nice
pink
foamy
head
it
had
wine
like
characteristic
and
is
a
great
fruit
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
raspberry
lambic
but
a
lot
stronger
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
but
that
could
be
due
to
the
big
beer
i
drank
at
the
fest
velvety
smooth
and
incredibly
drinkable
highly
recommended
apparently
it
has
four
times
the
amount
of
raspberries
that
rubeaus
had
in
it
and
after
trying
it
you
can
definitely
tell
that
is
the
truth
tastes
ands
feels
exactly
like
smarties
candy
in
seltzer
club
soda
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
love
this
it
somehow
manages
to
avoid
all
cough
syrup
flavors
and
it
ages
quite
well
into
a
nice
sour
3
415
00
the
pour
is
a
dark
blood
red
with
a
head
that
has
a
pink
hue
nose
is
cherries
green
vegetables
and
stale
cereal
taste
is
a
bit
stronger
cherry
gets
a
touch
medicinal
finish
is
slightly
tart
a
big
syrupy
body
and
moderate
carbonation
not
the
best
fruited
beer
overall
good
springsummer
beer
provided
you
like
cherries
not
as
stately
as
quelque
chose
but
certainly
more
sessionable
that
being
said
i
liked
it
very
much
for
what
it
is
a
nice
fruit
flavored
drink
if
only
this
was
sour
mashed
it
would
add
the
perfect
kick
not
bad
though
this
is
a
very
pleasant
brew
it
is
very
smooth
and
the
flavors
mesh
very
well
it
is
a
perfect
summer
drink
i
prefer
rubaeus
as
i
like
raspberry
more
than
cherry
but
this
is
an
excellent
ale
and
a
nice
break
from
all
the
overly
hop
beers
out
there
very
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
knock
down
several
founders
cerise
and
not
think
twice
about
it
it
is
one
of
my
most
refreshing
beers
to
drink
during
the
summer
i
cant
wait
for
founders
to
make
cerise
once
again
overall
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
would
wonder
how
it
would
taste
fresh
but
pleasant
after
a
year
in
the
bottle
medium
bodied
at
best
with
a
tingly
effervescence
much
like
a
lambic
which
is
my
best
guess
as
to
what
they
were
aiming
for
i
like
lambics
but
im
glad
i
only
have
two
of
these
to
drink
the
overly
artificial
flavornose
is
depressing
being
from
michigan
myself
and
aware
of
the
heritage
of
cherry
growing
in
the
state
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
a
lot
but
i
cant
honestly
say
i
do
finally
a
founders
beer
i
dont
want
more
of
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
good
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
still
a
fruit
beer
it
has
a
red
hue
to
it
and
it
tastes
like
cherries
if
you
want
a
beer
look
for
something
else
if
you
love
cherries
then
you
will
love
this
id
definitely
get
it
again
but
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
and
also
i
would
have
to
make
sure
that
none
of
my
friends
would
see
me
drinking
it
the
founders
cerise
from
founders
brewing
company
is
a
great
beer
the
appearance
is
both
red
and
murky
the
aroma
or
flavor
of
the
beer
has
strong
notes
of
cherry
which
is
obvious
when
looking
at
the
name
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
refreshing
the
taste
was
light
bubbly
fruity
and
sweet
i
would
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
nonbeer
drinkers
as
a
great
place
to
start
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
too
much
like
a
cherry
soda
needs
less
carbonation
and
the
sourness
is
a
little
overpowering
in
the
end
not
on
the
top
of
the
list
for
fruit
beers
tasty
but
not
something
id
get
again
theres
other
cherry
brews
out
there
that
offer
more
of
a
diverse
palate
than
this
one
though
to
their
credit
i
dont
think
ive
drank
a
faster
6
5
bottle
of
beer
before
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
wish
i
had
more
deep
pinkish
red
transient
white
head
with
a
ring
of
retention
no
lacing
nose
has
cherryraspberry
light
cracker
and
some
yeast
character
taste
has
some
sweeter
cherry
pie
raspberry
and
general
berry
notes
some
grainy
notes
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
a
passable
fruit
beer
but
not
something
id
actively
search
for
poured
a
dark
ruby
red
in
color
with
fucia
highlights
and
a
thin
bubbly
pink
head
that
barely
left
any
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
big
on
the
grains
upfront
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
cherry
fruit
slight
citrus
and
a
little
malty
sweetness
presence
like
the
nose
suggested
it
was
filled
with
a
variety
of
grains
in
the
flavor
alongside
muted
cherry
fruit
character
malty
sweetness
hints
of
citrus
and
a
touch
of
juice
the
brew
was
light
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
grainy
slightly
fruity
and
thin
crisp
finish
just
a
decent
fruit
beer
and
nothing
more
o
i
wont
miss
this
beer
its
a
step
up
over
the
fauxfruit
lambics
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
just
a
solid
cherry
ladened
beverage
bring
on
the
rubaeus
overall
not
overly
impressed
but
it
was
worth
a
try
but
probably
the
best
cherry
beer
i
have
had
overall
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
i
dont
normally
lean
towards
fruit
beers
sometimes
because
i
think
it
takes
the
manliness
away
this
brew
is
feels
like
a
belgian
ale
with
the
wrong
label
would
i
buy
it
again
of
course
though
now
that
i
found
out
that
its
retired
would
be
a
little
harder
salud
o
nice
change
from
my
usual
dark
ales
not
blushing
monk
quality
but
a
good
beer
similar
but
better
that
a
cooler
nothing
bad
to
say
worth
a
try
for
this
style
of
beer
overall
not
a
horrible
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
one
that
would
appeal
to
those
who
enjoy
fruit
vegetable
beers
or
lambics
i
think
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
one
simply
because
everything
else
i
have
ever
had
from
this
brewery
has
been
so
phenomenal
but
this
one
is
definitely
still
worth
a
try
o
not
the
most
fruity
sour
or
malty
beer
on
the
planet
but
for
the
style
it
is
above
average
get
it
while
you
can
o
for
syrupy
cherry
beers
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
is
better
appearance
is
a
reddish
amber
color
the
smallerthanaverage
head
is
a
light
red
color
the
scent
is
weak
malts
with
not
much
discernible
cherry
the
cherry
really
comes
through
in
the
taste
it
tastes
almost
like
a
cherry
soda
but
some
light
malts
flavors
are
present
slightly
sweet
but
not
overly
so
like
other
fruit
beers
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
not
bad
at
all
but
not
great
either
do
while
this
beer
presents
some
authentic
evidence
of
fruit
that
makes
it
worthy
of
consumption
it
also
has
some
detracting
features
flavors
are
a
mixed
bag
of
appealing
and
otherwise
coming
across
as
just
a
little
too
dark
and
metallic
thus
overall
appeal
is
constrained
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
cherryflavored
beer
that
has
some
substance
to
it
overall
ill
tell
you
what
i
really
like
this
there
truly
is
a
greaqt
complexity
and
balance
here
and
the
cherry
truly
tastes
natural
imho
not
flavored
or
like
candy
at
all
i
eat
cherries
fairly
often
and
thats
what
i
traste
natural
cherry
i
get
natural
sweetness
and
i
also
get
that
mouthwatering
tartness
that
cherries
have
i
also
get
wheat
beer
characteristics
and
just
enough
floral
hop
to
really
add
an
unexpected
balance
and
depth
i
think
this
is
heads
and
shoulders
above
any
wine
cooler
or
flavored
malt
beverage
ita
cherry
fermented
ale
just
like
it
says
on
the
label
if
you
like
cherries
i
think
youre
going
to
love
this
and
i
like
cherries
o
o
a
nice
light
cherry
beer
white
a
good
touch
of
wheat
doesnt
touch
the
greatness
of
a
new
glarus
fruit
beer
but
i
would
drink
this
one
in
the
summer
after
cutting
the
lawn
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
from
founders
whom
i
think
make
great
beers
totally
a
summer
beer
but
im
still
enjoying
it
in
november
an
intriguing
brew
but
not
well
thought
out
its
too
light
with
no
defining
characteristics
its
relaxed
and
enjoyable
but
not
heavy
or
expansive
not
too
recommended
if
your
a
lover
of
more
tart
fruit
brews
onot
bad
with
some
solid
cherry
flavor
but
overall
i
guess
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
cherry
beers
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
not
good
rübæus
is
great
pure
fresh
natural
cerise
should
essentially
be
the
same
damn
beer
only
with
cherries
wrong
something
happened
and
the
flavoraroma
is
plagued
with
offputting
components
like
vitamins
and
chalk
one
of
founders
weakest
offerings
just
wait
for
rübæus
to
be
released
pours
a
very
cloudy
red
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
a
little
it
of
alcohol
at
first
then
followed
by
sweet
red
cherries
some
berryjamlike
aromas
along
with
the
smallest
amount
of
tart
aroma
part
of
it
smells
like
a
white
zin
which
i
find
strange
taste
is
very
fruity
at
first
with
a
somewhat
offputting
metallic
flavor
slightly
tart
but
nothing
along
the
lines
of
a
sour
beer
much
more
sweet
sweet
cherries
with
some
other
berry
flavors
this
is
one
damn
tasty
fruit
beer
more
cherries
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
tinglytart
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
very
nice
carbonation
for
this
style
drinkability
is
high
overall
fruit
beers
are
not
really
my
thing
so
i
am
trying
my
best
to
rate
this
for
what
it
is
honestly
though
i
really
enjoy
it
i
enjoy
it
a
lot
more
than
other
fruit
beers
i
have
had
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
midlevel
carbonation
that
creates
an
initially
crisp
but
then
smooth
as
the
carbonation
diminishes
mouthfeel
closes
dryly
with
some
residual
sweetnessstickiness
around
the
mouth
o
an
interesting
beer
if
you
love
cherries
this
beer
is
for
you
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
though
not
my
cup
of
beer
overall
it
definitely
is
what
it
says
it
is
and
doesnt
hold
back
without
being
overdone
although
it
approaches
that
line
d
not
bad
it
is
unusually
drinkable
for
a
non
sour
fruit
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
deep
ruby
coloring
with
no
head
whatsoever
aromas
of
a
slight
roasting
and
a
watered
down
subtle
cherry
tartness
it
almost
smells
like
when
you
make
jello
and
have
to
boil
water
and
add
it
to
the
mix
pack
that
initial
smell
when
the
water
hits
the
powder
only
from
a
couple
of
rooms
away
thats
what
this
smells
like
flavors
are
rich
and
deeply
sweet
with
a
solid
cherry
flavor
definitely
more
maracino
than
black
only
a
subtle
tartness
in
the
palate
and
the
beer
refrains
from
getting
into
the
sugary
or
syrupy
realm
this
brew
has
legit
fruit
flavors
the
beer
is
thin
and
with
a
slight
carbonation
it
has
a
very
crisp
feel
in
mouth
sweet
moderate
aftertaste
that
has
an
even
fade
as
the
palate
clears
extremely
clean
finish
this
beer
is
completely
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
not
bad
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
cherries
by
themselves
i
surprising
enjoyed
this
beer
solid
offering
from
founders
o
i
like
the
taste
of
this
i
just
dont
pick
up
any
resemblance
to
beer
its
still
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
that
i
have
had
though
im
gonna
state
upfront
that
i
hated
this
but
i
try
to
review
objectively
and
fairly
this
beer
poured
up
a
bright
ruby
red
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
was
mainly
cherries
mouthfeel
was
just
about
average
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
taste
well
it
didnt
taste
at
all
like
beer
to
me
it
tasted
more
like
a
cherry
sundrop
or
weak
wine
but
once
you
get
used
to
the
taste
it
is
drinkable
not
my
favorite
as
i
stated
upfront
but
i
think
founders
succeeded
in
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
im
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
fan
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
sweet
at
times
all
things
considered
it
was
a
very
tasty
drinkable
beer
the
cherries
were
forward
and
delicious
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
thick
it
comes
across
at
times
more
like
juice
than
beer
nonetheless
its
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
a
cherry
fan
a
real
unique
fruitbased
beer
interesting
flavors
on
their
own
but
not
quite
harmonious
together
i
really
couldnt
imagine
having
more
than
one
the
beer
pours
like
fruit
punch
a
beautiful
cherry
red
with
a
slight
browning
towards
the
middle
the
head
is
but
a
skim
of
white
bubbles
that
leave
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
sides
carbonation
seems
well
accounted
for
by
the
bubbles
running
to
the
top
but
overall
the
beer
is
too
dark
and
cherrymurky
to
look
through
the
beer
smells
surprisingly
more
malty
than
anything
else
there
is
a
good
breadybiscuity
background
to
the
beer
and
the
sweet
metallic
tang
of
the
cherries
is
definitely
present
and
some
very
subtle
pearlike
esters
from
the
yeast
the
beer
tastes
sour
and
mellow
with
a
nice
puckering
sweet
dancing
bellow
all
else
in
the
beer
the
malt
is
present
as
a
slight
biscuity
taste
and
the
pear
esters
are
definitely
present
but
the
cherries
are
the
main
event
here
and
they
play
out
nicely
leaving
a
sour
pang
your
mouth
and
little
else
the
cherries
tart
does
have
a
slightly
metallic
tinge
to
it
like
sucking
down
iron
which
detracts
slightly
from
the
beers
drinkablility
though
overall
the
beer
is
very
nice
to
sip
or
chug
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mellow
with
a
slight
thickness
to
the
beer
and
a
little
carbonated
prick
but
overall
very
refreshing
and
mellow
on
the
tongue
there
is
some
slight
saliva
running
in
the
tongue
and
a
light
puckering
sour
pang
but
other
than
that
the
mouth
is
very
clean
overall
this
is
a
nice
fruit
beer
it
is
above
average
but
not
by
that
much
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
i
felt
like
the
malts
and
cherry
played
nicer
there
than
they
do
when
poured
from
a
bottle
a
great
slightly
sour
fruit
ale
that
is
a
nice
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
this
wont
sweep
you
off
your
feet
but
its
worthy
of
going
back
for
a
few
more
overall
a
decent
beer
but
one
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
i
may
change
my
mind
once
i
try
to
make
a
beer
float
out
of
it
overall
a
great
summer
sipper
beer
tart
refreshing
smooth
and
very
drinkable
the
taste
is
up
front
sweet
like
cherries
with
the
malt
character
coming
on
the
back
of
the
tonge
the
sweetness
stays
the
whole
way
through
the
mouth
feel
is
good
nice
and
smooth
carbonation
is
good
overall
a
sweet
and
drinkable
beer
i
would
want
to
session
this
but
one
once
in
a
while
for
a
change
is
good
for
me
ive
tried
this
beer
3
or
4
times
at
this
point
and
each
time
it
lets
me
down
i
had
rubaeus
the
last
year
it
was
around
that
was
a
killer
fruit
beer
the
flavors
never
really
meld
here
its
pale
and
fruity
i
expect
more
from
founders
overall
it
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
and
although
a
bit
sweet
it
is
quite
nice
if
a
fruit
beer
is
something
you
are
craving
then
i
say
go
for
this
one
as
it
is
rather
nice
overall
refreshing
and
drinkable
try
it
o
probably
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
had
not
super
sweet
or
super
sour
could
probably
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
might
be
a
good
beer
to
mix
with
others
one
i
will
seek
out
again
to
see
what
it
does
to
a
stout
hayward
abbey
rating
79
o
this
was
okay
but
definitely
a
little
bit
disappointing
for
a
founders
beer
not
too
much
aroma
a
little
bit
artificial
tasting
and
fairly
flat
that
being
said
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
it
wasnt
terrible
just
had
high
expectations
id
recommend
trying
it
if
you
are
a
fruit
beer
fan
but
probably
stay
away
from
it
if
you
arent
a
decent
summer
brew
but
i
maybe
expected
more
from
founders
easy
drinking
oeasily
the
worst
founders
beer
ive
had
youd
think
theyd
be
able
to
make
something
better
for
the
summer
o
well
i
never
had
a
cherry
pie
for
a
beer
but
with
the
alcohol
smell
i
can
tell
its
a
beer
two
more
i
probably
will
be
able
to
finish
but
will
probably
not
buy
this
again
possibly
my
least
favorite
founders
beer
not
to
say
that
it
isnt
its
own
beast
its
a
fruit
beer
with
pie
flavor
if
youre
a
cherry
pie
fan
this
is
your
speed
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
a
flavor
profile
that
is
sessionable
to
me
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
probably
have
another
at
some
time
in
the
future
o
this
is
good
beer
with
a
pleasing
cherry
flavor
and
tartness
with
just
the
right
balance
of
sweetness
the
cherry
flavor
is
spot
on
but
i
would
like
a
stronger
cherry
presence
in
the
nose
o
i
tend
to
enjoy
fruit
beers
but
this
one
really
missed
the
mark
for
me
the
flavor
is
weak
and
very
one
dimensional
it
was
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
mouhfeel
light
fizzy
but
this
all
works
fine
for
this
beer
fruity
good
cherry
flavor
just
a
bit
one
dimensional
would
have
liked
to
tasted
more
tartness
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
too
many
of
these
either
i
only
bought
one
o
a
great
cherry
beer
but
lacked
the
tartness
and
complexity
i
was
hoping
for
refreshing
fo
sho
but
not
the
beer
im
wanting
to
settle
down
with
this
is
cherry
pie
in
a
glass
that
said
the
ridiculous
strawberry
donut
flavor
isnt
that
bad
maybe
im
slightly
more
forgiving
since
i
can
still
remember
the
similar
but
several
orders
of
magnitude
worse
ommegang
aphrodite
this
beer
is
cloying
and
to
get
right
down
to
it
bad
but
i
can
probably
finish
the
glass
i
like
donuts
every
so
often
i
guess
so
who
is
this
beer
for
i
dunno
cant
figure
that
market
out
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
far
from
even
average
in
the
founders
lineup
pretty
good
cherry
taste
but
the
flavor
overall
is
too
weak
still
doesnt
come
off
as
overly
sweet
or
artificial
like
many
fruit
beers
so
thats
a
plus
i
think
founders
was
going
for
an
accessible
changeup
for
their
lineup
and
it
succeeds
there
but
not
really
up
to
par
with
their
other
work
d
very
drinkable
the
tartness
and
boldness
of
the
cherry
flavor
is
really
nice
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
like
this
one
a
lot
it
is
a
well
made
fruit
beer
that
doesnt
feel
gimmicky
or
overly
sweet
ill
definitely
have
this
one
again
this
grew
on
me
a
bit
probably
the
first
beer
from
founders
that
wasnt
overly
impressive
having
recently
grabbed
a
bottle
of
lindemans
kriek
this
one
was
not
living
up
while
not
a
bad
beer
the
dominating
tartness
is
a
little
offputting
and
the
sweetness
doesnt
get
a
chance
to
really
show
that
its
there
d
this
is
alright
its
a
bit
more
balanced
than
most
fruit
beers
but
the
bitterness
is
a
killer
i
may
have
again
o
an
interesting
cherry
beer
from
founders
that
manages
to
use
the
fruit
without
making
it
too
sweet
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
more
complex
and
that
the
nose
was
more
present
as
i
didnt
smell
too
much
on
this
one
at
all
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
fruit
beers
or
flanders
oud
bruin
odi
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
appreciate
the
effort
put
into
making
it
one
single
is
enough
for
me
but
there
is
a
truly
authentic
cherry
flavor
within
this
beer
and
i
commend
that
far
better
than
most
fruity
wheat
beers
but
no
lambic
by
any
means
one
of
the
prettiest
beers
o
good
fruit
beer
that
has
a
slight
berlineresque
twist
to
it
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
bottled
on
52412
pours
a
candy
apple
red
with
a
half
inch
of
bright
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
smell
is
cherry
and
vanilla
not
complaining
taste
is
very
cherry
but
not
over
the
top
body
is
medium
plenty
of
life
not
dry
and
perfect
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
cherry
beer
and
a
very
good
one
not
for
everyone
but
founders
does
it
again
o
while
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
all
the
time
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
my
glass
certainly
worth
a
try
o
im
not
sure
if
it
is
trying
to
be
a
fruit
beer
or
a
sour
it
does
have
some
nice
sour
qualities
im
torn
and
shall
rate
it
middle
of
the
pack
the
body
is
full
and
sticky
with
soft
carbonation
it
really
coats
the
pallet
for
sure
overall
this
one
isnt
very
good
i
think
its
just
too
sweet
i
was
hoping
for
something
lighter
and
more
refreshing
this
seems
to
be
more
of
a
dessert
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
but
i
feel
like
a
12oz
bottle
is
too
small
of
a
size
and
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
for
the
4
pack
14
its
a
good
beer
and
i
will
probably
end
up
spending
the
money
on
the
4pack
next
time
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
but
i
dont
think
the
majority
of
beer
drinkers
would
spend
so
much
on
a
fruit
beer
pours
a
brownish
pink
color
with
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
lightly
tart
cherries
sweet
sugar
and
definite
malt
presence
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
tart
cherries
highlighting
the
flavors
and
a
definite
malt
presence
that
i
wasnt
expecting
for
some
reason
i
thought
this
would
be
more
like
a
ng
fruit
beer
but
it
comes
closer
to
a
sa
cherry
wheat
but
of
course
blows
it
away
light
palate
strong
carbonation
easy
drinking
too
bad
they
stopped
making
this
one
m
thintomedium
body
very
smooth
and
drinkable
despite
being
so
sweet
surprisingly
dry
and
clean
in
the
finish
great
for
the
spring
and
summer
time
cerise
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
small
pink
lacy
head
the
smell
has
a
dry
malty
undertone
like
a
pils
with
strong
sweet
tarty
cherry
aroma
the
taste
has
a
mixture
of
sweet
and
with
a
mellow
cherry
flavor
ontop
of
a
dry
pilsner
like
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
the
fruit
isnt
over
powering
but
present
overall
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
blended
well
and
great
in
the
summer
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
its
tasty
to
be
sure
but
if
the
cherry
were
taken
away
the
base
wheat
beer
would
only
be
an
average
beer
the
cherry
certainly
adds
to
the
color
aroma
and
taste
but
it
can
only
do
so
much
with
an
average
base
beer
still
its
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
andor
cherries
one
of
the
deepest
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
insanely
delicate
flavorful
and
complicated
this
is
how
fruit
is
supposed
to
be
used
this
is
a
beer
with
fruit
added
not
a
fruit
beer
starts
off
medicinal
then
oddly
boozy
finishing
with
artificial
cherry
flavors
lingering
bitterness
feels
out
of
place
this
isnt
bad
but
its
pretty
far
from
being
good
a
rare
miss
from
the
rock
stars
at
founders
onot
a
bad
beer
not
anything
too
fancy
or
complex
but
tastes
pretty
good
would
have
again
on
occasion
o
a
decent
fruit
beer
slightly
tart
and
its
a
decent
base
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
fruit
o
nice
to
try
as
an
experiment
may
have
one
now
and
then
overall
i
was
not
overly
impressed
nor
tunred
off
by
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
generally
fruity
offering
then
this
will
suffice
however
dont
think
that
just
because
there
is
a
cherry
on
the
bottle
that
that
is
what
you
are
going
to
get
o
its
always
good
to
have
your
expectations
exceeded
theres
enough
of
a
noncherry
character
to
make
it
a
worthwhile
summer
staple
founders
does
it
again
i
think
so
this
is
a
weird
one
pours
majorly
cloudy
pink
color
like
pepto
bismol
almost
small
lacey
white
head
not
totally
appetizing
in
appearance
but
most
certainly
intriguing
smells
like
cherries
and
an
overdoese
of
yeast
not
a
sour
beer
but
soe
definite
tartness
going
on
flavor
isnt
bad
at
all
lots
of
fresh
cherries
which
is
the
dominant
flavor
by
far
but
some
interesting
yeast
character
and
a
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
weird
this
is
a
heavy
beer
in
a
lighter
genre
its
almost
too
much
to
drink
a
glass
of
this
let
alone
several
good
carbonation
but
kind
of
chalky
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
but
this
assuredly
isnt
the
brew
that
made
founders
famous
not
bad
very
out
there
overall
this
beer
is
a
disappointment
i
can
confidently
say
that
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
been
disappointed
by
a
founders
beer
unfortunately
this
is
a
drain
pour
which
is
a
first
for
founders
very
drinkable
but
not
my
bag
what
to
do
with
the
other
three
ill
pass
but
for
those
who
like
sweeter
fruit
beers
i
could
see
the
appeal
for
this
one
overall
an
enjoyable
supercherry
beer
o
a
solid
straight
on
approach
to
a
fruit
beer
in
this
case
it
works
definitely
not
sickly
sweet
like
some
lindemans
kriek
immediately
comes
to
mind
and
not
too
tart
either
try
it
out
if
you
like
cherries
o
a
good
beer
if
you
like
fruit
beers
or
cherries
or
both
give
this
a
whirl
overall
this
is
a
easydrinking
and
somewhat
refreshing
cherry
beer
i
wish
it
were
cheaper
as
it
is
a
nice
summer
heat
beer
actually
id
buy
it
more
often
overall
good
for
the
summer
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
day
even
founders
struggles
with
this
difficult
style
o
not
a
fan
wish
it
was
more
tart
than
sweet
and
the
metallic
flavor
was
offputting
founders

cerise
pours
a
chalky
purplered
cloudy
ale
with
medium
head
and
extensive
linear
lacing
nose
is
undistinguished
faint
indistinct
maybe
some
fruit

not
cloying

not

know
this
isnt

with
some
nice
sourness
in
the
mix
bready
substantive
meallike
cant
find
a
bitter
note
in
the
15
ibus
either
i
know
they
arent
supposed
to
be
there
some
funky
complexity
and
fun
to
try
although
if
you
want
your
fruit
beer
to
be
a
lambic
then
youd
better
have
a
lambic
ya
know
i
liked
this
however
to
the
end
o
a
fine
cherry
beer
to
be
concise
but
i
must
mention
that
this
reminds
me
of
the
blushing
monk
in
many
ways
that
said
it
reminds
me
of
all
the
things
that
the
blushing
monk
did
better
with
raspberries
ergo
worthy
of
having
but
not
the
best
o
really
good
for
drinkability
for
a
fruit
beer
i
can
do
a
12oz
to
myself
fairly
easily
well
made
overall
its
pretty
close
up
there
with
ng
belgium
red
as
far
as
fruity
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
sweetness
is
satisfying
but
not
overdone
just
the
right
amount
of
tart
character
great
balance
as
well
not
a
style
i
will
usually
drink
but
exceptional
for
what
it
is
o
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
prefer
this
to
others
ive
had
well
done
for
a
fruit
beer
i
have
had
some
better
though
easy
to
drink
and
offers
something
different
for
the
palate
could
be
thicker
but
its
good
otherwise
o
this
is
a
different
take
on
beer
maybe
cherrybarley
wine
might
be
a
better
description
lambic
drinkers
and
wine
lovers
will
like
this
beer
or
at
least
should
give
it
a
try
and
everyone
else
might
want
to
try
it
too
just
to
experince
the
broad
range
of
things
that
can
be
called
beer
original
review
on
10142010
o
for
what
it
is
this
is
about
as
good
as
expected
but
its
just
not
my
thing
the
cherries
dominate
as
of
course
they
should
in
a
cherry
beer
but
theres
not
much
else
to
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
ton
of
cherry
syrup
notes
in
it
as
well
as
a
hint
of
tartness
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
tart
cherries
as
well
as
some
syrupy
sweetness
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
raspberry
character
and
a
hint
of
biscuit
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
estrella
chalice
this
beer
is
very
interesting
it
has
a
beautiful
pink
tinted
color
to
it
and
a
very
enticing
cherry
aroma
the
taste
is
incredibly
reminiscent
of
cherry
pie
the
cherry
flavor
it
gives
off
is
akin
to
that
of
canned
cherries
with
its
surgery
sweetiness
and
tart
almost
sour
finish
the
malt
in
this
beer
gives
it
a
nice
grainy
buttery
feel
which
is
really
what
wraps
it
all
up
to
be
like
cherry
pie
i
have
tried
quite
a
few
vegetablefruit
beers
in
my
time
and
i
know
many
people
including
myself
who
dont
normally
enjoy
them
however
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
to
all
beer
geeks
it
is
just
executed
so
very
well
the
taste
isnt
nearly
overwhelming
like
in
many
fruit
flavored
beers
and
im
honestly
quite
confused
as
to
why
founders
decided
to
put
this
beer
in
a
4pack
rather
than
a
6
pack
the
low
alcohol
content
combined
with
the
balanced
and
deliciously
refreshing
flavor
would
make
this
beer
very
sessionalbe
to
those
people
such
as
myself
who
enjoy
it
so
much
glad
i
picked
this
up
o
i
like
cherry
beers
i
particularly
like
ones
that
i
dont
have
to
worry
to
much
about
heartburn
an
hour
later
lol
this
is
good
for
what
it
is
an
ale
with
cherries
nothing
fancy
at
all
but
well
pulled
off
the
aroma
is
a
little
lacking
but
the
taste
takes
the
reins
o
simple
but
tasty
almost
pure
cherries
but
not
overpowering
or
syrupysickly
sweet
not
like
cherry
soda
either
like
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
i
enjoyed
it
o
not
surprising
for
a
brewery
that
brought
blushing
monk
onto
the
scene
cerise
is
rich
tart
and
complex
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
before
dinner
as
an
appetizer
during
a
big
meaty
meal
or
after
dinner
as
a
sweet
dessert
beer
drinkable
and
highly
versatile
2
a
single
overall
a
very
different
fruit
brew
very
natural
in
fruit
flavor
but
also
somewhat
unbalanced
ill
try
to
have
this
again
fresh
so
i
can
get
the
intended
taste
profile
a
nice
oneoff
beer
that
could
replace
the
standard
mimosa
and
is
clearly
superior
to
wine
coolers
however
this
one
is
far
to
sweet
for
a
second
round
this
is
a
relatively
hard
to
get
beer
in
cny
but
its
worth
trying
for
its
price
this
is
a
sophisticated
cherry
beer
that
would
impress
both
your
lady
and
guy
friends
however
its
definitely
worth
waiting
until
dessert
considering
its
sweetness
overall
its
all
about
the
sweet
cherries
too
sweet
and
onedimensional
for
me
a
poor
mans
new
glarus
belgian
red
overall
for
a
fruity
beer
very
well
done
easily
drinkable
fruity
but
very
good
balance
not
incredible
but
pretty
good
might
be
priced
a
bit
high
o
i
had
to
pour
this
out
it
was
just
horribly
unenjoyable
then
again
this
bottle
has
been
lightstruck
on
a
sales
floor
for
1
5
years
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
example
of
this
beer
because
i
do
thoroughly
enjoy
fruit
beers
lambics
and
sours
overall
an
unusually
ok
offering
from
founders
not
really
worth
the
price
hike
of
a
4pack
o
i
liked
the
tartness
to
finish
the
beer
but
the
overall
heavy
sweetness
was
too
much
for
me
cost
3
19
for
a
single
10
99
for
a
four
pack
othis
is
a
great
fruit
beer
look
out
abita
strawberry
because
the
sour
notes
of
this
bring
a
domestic
beer
even
closer
to
that
elusive
and
expensive
lambic
good
for
you
founders
o
this
smells
way
more
intense
than
the
taste
would
have
you
believe
the
taste
is
good
though
a
bit
sour
for
my
liking
its
definitely
mellow
though
and
not
to
be
confused
with
a
sour
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
fresh
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
super
sweet
beer
tons
of
cherry
all
over
th
place
i
shared
a
few
with
some
friends
and
all
the
girls
liked
it
and
the
guys
werent
too
keen
tastes
like
a
beer
wine
cooler
not
on
my
top
list
to
try
again
but
if
you
are
trying
to
get
your
gf
something
give
it
a
shot
overall
nothing
terribly
impressive
a
simple
sustained
cherry
flavor
not
my
favorite
style
so
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
to
it
either
o
as
others
have
noted
i
felt
this
was
slightly
one
dimensional
its
an
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
that
doesnt
have
the
fake
or
overdone
fruit
flavors
that
many
do
having
tried
a
few
cherry
ales
this
is
one
of
the
weaker
ive
had
the
fruit
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
dominated
instead
by
tart
im
already
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
but
if
i
had
to
have
one
it
wouldnt
be
this
one
im
surprised
i
havent
had
this
before
but
cerise
is
pretty
tasty
its
like
wisconsin
belgian
redlite
its
glowing
orange
hazy
amber
with
almost
no
head
the
beer
smells
clovey
and
spicy
with
a
lot
of
yeast
character
and
a
little
bit
of
bruised
cherries
the
beer
is
maltforward
with
a
slightly
tart
bing
cherry
flavor
that
permeates
throughout
the
finish
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
fruitiness
that
lasts
it
tastes
much
better
than
it
couldve
been
and
i
really
enjoyed
having
as
a
before
bed
treat
its
sometimes
tough
to
find
just
the
right
beer
to
end
the
night
this
was
a
pretty
good
choice
ill
definitely
be
seeking
this
out
again
pinkish
red
what
little
head
that
appears
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
mild
but
pleasant
soft
cherries
nice
citrusy
notes
very
pleasant
taste
mild
cherry
flavor
tart
maybe
some
grapefruit
little
hops
great
carbonation
incredibly
refreshing
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
all
day
drink
a
good
fruit
beer
a
bit
thick
but
still
well
balanced
and
tasteful
ive
been
happy
with
all
the
founders
i
have
tried
light
redorange
with
no
head
or
lace
clear
aroma
is
grain
and
cherries
though
not
overpowering
light
hopping
with
most
of
the
flavor
coming
from
the
grains
with
noticeable
cherry
in
background
very
distinct
cherry
flavor
different
from
other
similar
brews
possibly
because
of
the
lower
than
expected
acidity
light
body
and
high
carbonation
o
not
overly
sweet
i
think
a
little
age
did
this
beer
well
o
if
you
love
cherries
this
would
be
your
beer
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
i
wouldnt
expect
more
from
these
beers
probably
on
the
bottom
end
of
what
founders
makes
even
so
being
made
by
founders
makes
it
not
a
horrible
brew
overall
i
came
into
this
thinking
that
it
could
be
the
one
brew
from
founders
that
i
wouldnt
love
and
while
that
ended
up
being
true
i
still
liked
it
but
there
are
other
fruity
offerings
out
there
that
i
think
are
volumes
above
i
think
anybody
looking
for
a
fruity
brew
would
get
their
fix
from
this
though
o
not
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
but
nothing
great
overall
a
unique
combination
of
sweet
and
tart
that
is
sugary
but
never
cloying
founders
cerise
was
on
tap
at
out
local
watering
hole
the
beer
came
in
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
ruby
red
with
decent
white
head
that
did
not
lace
i
have
noticed
fruitysweeter
beers
do
not
lace
the
smell
hello
cherry
malt
the
taste
to
me
was
like
a
grenadine
infusion
that
really
made
the
beer
like
jcm
song
title
cherry
bomb
the
sweetness
and
overpowering
cherry
flavor
made
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
tricky
i
drank
half
then
switched
it
with
someone
else
overall
a
great
beer
that
hit
its
mark
pours
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
fizzy
gold
with
ever
slight
pinkish
hue
lots
of
carbonation
but
little
head
smells
faintly
of
cherries
hops
is
present
in
the
scent
not
sweet
taste
is
super
cherries
and
super
tart
puckering
and
dry
sweetens
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
tart
overall
enjoyable
cherry
ale
it
is
very
fruity
cherry
flavored
to
be
precise
this
nearly
overpowers
all
semblance
of
an
ale
nearly
but
its
still
ale
and
not
without
merit
its
just
a
bit
too
fruity
and
sweet
and
tart
i
would
recommend
fans
of
the
genr
to
try
this
one
its
way
fruitier
than
most
i
will
try
to
stay
away
in
the
future
what
was
i
thinking
i
really
wasnt
sure
what
to
expected
with
this
one
fermented
fruits
can
work
well
in
beer
but
often
they
come
up
short
this
is
far
from
a
sour
but
certainly
a
nice
tart
flavor
highly
recommend
giving
this
one
a
shot
o
sort
of
like
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
in
the
sense
that
its
sweet
and
overly
fruity
but
its
got
a
nice
flavor
o
this
beer
goes
down
extremely
quickly
and
easily
this
is
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
i
turn
to
it
often
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
just
awesome
probably
the
best
aspect
cant
stop
smelling
it
i
am
continuing
with
my
mini
quest
to
try
the
rest
of
available
founders
beers
here
in
cleveland
that
i
have
had
not
had
yet
i
poured
the
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
to
find
a
nice
reddish
orange
body
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
a
few
hints
of
cherry
malt
and
a
bit
of
sourness
the
taste
was
good
the
cherry
flavor
was
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
but
the
cherry
flavor
was
done
just
right
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
tartness
sweetness
and
some
funk
this
wasnt
very
complex
and
was
a
pretty
straight
forward
beer
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
for
this
medium
bodied
beer
that
also
left
a
bit
of
cherry
aftertaste
overall
a
good
summer
beer
from
founders
i
enjoy
the
occasional
fruit
beer
but
at
the
same
time
i
would
probably
pick
up
a
few
others
before
this
one
overall
the
flavour
wasnt
too
over
the
top
so
it
was
drinkable
but
not
something
that
i
would
want
more
than
1
bottle
of
happy
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
i
like
how
weird
this
beer
is
it
completely
reminds
me
of
pink
champagne
in
just
about
every
way
if
youre
into
that
then
you
will
like
this
beer
too
o
kind
of
a
disappointment
but
not
bad
i
would
not
buy
this
again
though
overall
id
recommend
cerise
for
someone
who
loves
cherry
flavor
but
is
not
into
ultratart
krieks
this
one
might
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
say
its
just
right
it
manages
to
stay
just
this
side
of
cloying
i
could
see
vanilla
notes
working
extremely
well
in
a
barrelaged
version
of
this
b
pours
a
hazy
light
red
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
fruity
cherry
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
and
sour
cherry
flavors
there
is
a
souracidic
quality
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
after
each
sip
there
is
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
with
a
nice
sour
cherry
flavor
a
good
refreshment
for
the
hot
summer
months
pours
a
medium
reddish
amber
with
some
white
fizz
which
mostly
dissipates
within
a
few
minutes
to
a
ring
no
lacing
smells
like
tart
cherry
melon
pale
malt
whiff
of
roastiness
pretty
restrained
taste
is
a
sweet
cherry
some
malt
not
a
whole
lot
else
lightly
carbonated
on
a
medium
body
well
done
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
tasty
cherry
beer
kind
of
like
a
mellower
version
of
wisconsin
belgian
red
i
can
see
being
put
off
by
the
sweetness
or
prominence
of
the
cherry
flavor
but
what
do
you
expect
o
not
my
favorite
cherry
beer
but
this
is
certainly
a
solid
offering
i
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
but
i
would
gladly
enjoy
another
overall
this
is
a
very
good
fruity
beer
not
quite
up
to
the
caliber
of
new
glarus
belgian
red
but
very
good
in
its
own
right
best
drank
slowly
after
on
a
cool
summer
night
after
a
warm
day
very
happy
to
have
a
whole
growler
of
this
not
comparable
to
an
unfiltered
belgian
kriek
as
far
as
my
taste
for
cherry
beers
but
a
very
drinkable
cherry
founders
wins
again
this
beer
is
exactly
as
it
claims
to
be
it
is
a
great
combo
of
tart
and
sweet
both
of
those
characteristics
come
through
from
the
cherries
it
is
thin
in
body
and
light
in
carbonation
head
but
fits
as
founders
springsummer
seasonal
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
fruit
beer
very
nicely
done
very
flavorful
without
being
overly
sweet
not
the
kind
of
think
i
would
want
to
drink
regularly
but
something
to
reach
for
every
once
in
a
while
man
this
surprised
me
had
this
in
tap
at
the
beer
store
in
southampton
pours
a
very
light
pink
with
a
little
head
nose
us
nice
and
sweet
cherry
side
taste
winning
this
is
a
perfect
light
sour
the
fruit
element
isnt
at
all
overpowering
either
a
masterful
combination
this
is
how
you
beat
the
heat
cant
wait
to
have
anoter
o
i
initally
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
the
tartness
was
welcoming
and
proved
to
make
this
beer
very
complex
as
the
tasting
continued
the
sweetness
became
a
little
overwhelming
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
on
a
night
when
ive
become
hopped
out
this
beer
has
a
pinkish
orange
body
the
smell
is
sweet
but
not
very
strong
the
taste
of
cherries
is
apparent
but
could
be
a
little
stronger
for
my
tastes
the
beer
drinks
easily
like
a
lambic
with
a
refreshing
tartness
a
tasty
treat
that
i
will
be
trying
again
possibly
with
some
chocolate
ice
cream
cheers
ive
had
cerise
twice
and
the
first
time
it
was
fresh
the
second
time
it
had
a
few
months
of
age
on
it
the
beer
didnt
seem
to
change
a
whole
lot
other
than
the
flavor
a
little
bit
the
beer
still
poured
out
as
an
interesting
looking
golden
color
the
head
was
white
and
lasted
for
a
while
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
tart
cherry
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
cherry
it
seems
its
sweeter
when
its
fresh
but
leaves
a
sharp
tart
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
when
the
beer
is
a
little
older
it
tastes
more
sour
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
a
well
carbonated
and
fairly
drinkable
overall
its
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
i
still
prefer
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
over
this
and
ng
belgian
red
this
one
heck
of
a
summer
beer
but
ive
had
better
fruity
beers
i
expected
more
from
founders
but
still
a
solid
choice
for
a
lighty
fruity
palate
or
a
cheese
pairing
this
particular
bottle
is
sweeter
than
some
of
the
others
ive
tried
which
makes
me
like
it
a
touch
more
i
love
tart
cherries
and
i
really
want
this
one
to
be
intensely
interesting
but
it
just
falls
a
touch
short
every
time
not
bad
but
i
want
it
to
have
a
bit
bigger
kick
to
it
all
in
all
id
still
drink
it
by
the
growler
if
i
could
poured
from
the
stubby
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
as
founders
doesnt
disappoint
cherry
red
color
surprise
with
a
touch
of
ruby
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
bam
the
smell
was
awesome
i
like
fruity
beers
and
was
hoping
this
was
like
i
found
it
to
be
nice
and
fruity
smell
but
not
so
overpowering
or
sweet
of
a
cherry
taste
i
did
have
one
bit
of
off
flavor
so
thats
why
i
gave
the
taste
a
3
5
instead
of
4
cherry
hops
and
a
touch
of
malt
very
light
sweetness
if
any
easy
drinking
glad
i
tried
it
would
love
to
try
on
tap
to
see
if
the
flavors
develop
a
bit
more
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
51311
pours
slightly
hazy
light
orange
amber
color
with
a
fairly
dense
2
finger
white
head
with
very
nice
retention
that
reduces
to
a
decent
sized
lacing
cap
some
fairly
thick
lacing
is
present
on
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
tart
cherries
peach
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
funkiness
and
spiciness
pretty
nice
aromas
though
a
tad
weak
taste
of
big
tart
cherries
with
breadiness
spices
and
big
sweetness
in
the
back
wow
this
actually
tastes
just
like
cherry
pie
fairly
dry
finish
but
some
tart
cherries
spiciness
and
breadiness
does
stick
around
for
a
bit
medium
carbonation
and
body
very
drinkable
as
well
with
no
alcohol
noticed
other
than
a
small
warming
after
the
finish
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
it
is
founders
and
they
pretty
much
have
never
let
me
down
excellent
stuff
i
might
have
to
pick
up
a
4
pack
before
they
are
gone
for
the
season
the
pour
was
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
rich
reddish
copper
the
foam
was
about
13
inch
with
modest
lacing
as
the
session
progressed
the
aroma
was
nice
with
cherry
and
malt
overtones
as
expected
the
flavor
was
rich
with
the
sour
cherry
flavor
not
a
cloying
sweetness
the
tart
edge
evident
and
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
was
appropriate
not
too
full
the
overall
experience
was
very
good
i
do
not
regret
buying
this
beer
and
may
buy
more
d
decent
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
for
the
brave
or
uninitiated
not
bad
but
not
amazing
othis
is
a
world
class
fruit
beer
i
have
had
many
trying
to
find
one
that
my
wife
will
actually
drink
and
like
there
are
going
to
be
some
haters
on
this
beer
but
i
think
that
fruit
beers
youre
either
going
to
like
or
not
like
this
does
not
have
a
syrupy
cherry
flavor
folks
this
is
real
michigan
cherries
at
their
finest
o
tastes
like
a
sweet
cherry
pale
ale
at
times
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
this
beer
is
best
served
over
vanilla
or
peach
ice
cream
as
a
component
in
a
beer
float
it
can
be
tasty
it
can
also
work
when
mixed
with
juice
i
liked
it
when
mixed
with
an
orange
juicecarrot
juice
combo
unfortunately
its
more
difficult
to
drink
straight
although
i
enjoy
fruity
beer
such
as
lambics
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
founders
cerise
when
drunk
asis
the
beers
flavor
has
the
cherry
taste
and
not
much
else
more
like
a
juiceflavored
kids
drink
than
a
fruit
beer
i
would
have
appreciated
more
nuance
of
flavor
this
is
an
orangeamber
beer
with
almost
no
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
the
nose
features
some
light
cherry
scent
and
little
else
flavor
though
is
better
theres
a
lot
of
cherry
taste
moderately
tart
and
not
very
sweet
at
all
right
from
the
start
not
much
in
the
way
of
additional
flavors
bitterness
is
moderately
low
and
theres
not
any
hop
taste
to
detect
malt
gives
a
touch
of
caramel
cherries
are
the
center
here
and
its
very
welldone
o
founders
cerise
is
a
lovehate
kinda
beer
i
really
dug
it
though
my
drinking
buddy
most
certainly
did
not
if
you
can
approach
this
with
an
open
mind
youll
find
a
strikingly
original
brew
but
i
can
certainly
see
where
this
could
end
up
in
the
drain
d
overall
might
be
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
to
date
just
a
delicious
play
between
the
fruit
and
malt
im
surprised
more
people
dont
find
this
as
enjoyable
as
i
do
overall
this
is
a
an
enjoyable
brew
but
short
of
excellent
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
as
a
single
because
this
is
one
thats
fun
to
try
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
overall
not
a
bad
offering
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
out
for
it
however
overall
i
love
fruit
beers
and
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
has
a
pinkish
orange
body
with
a
faint
pink
amply
sized
head
that
leaves
lacing
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
after
the
head
is
reduced
to
a
bubbly
film
the
smell
is
sweet
and
cherryful
but
weak
i
feel
like
im
straining
myself
almost
to
pick
something
up
the
taste
is
very
apparent
and
thats
tart
michigan
cherries
the
beer
drinks
easily
like
a
lightly
carbonated
soda
or
a
lambic
almost
in
tartness
a
tasty
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
trying
it
again
too
soon
o
really
let
down
by
this
was
hoping
to
get
something
along
the
lines
of
belgian
red
and
got
something
that
fell
way
short
of
that
would
not
have
again
skal
o
very
easy
drinker
avni
gf
even
loves
this
beer
i
find
this
very
refreshing
for
the
summer
months
outstanding
no
but
a
very
solid
example
from
founders
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
am
very
happy
i
tried
it
but
i
would
prefer
a
nice
cherry
lambic
over
this
the
cherry
flavor
is
definitely
noticeable
just
would
like
it
if
this
was
sour
what
can
you
say
everything
founders
outs
out
seems
to
be
great
this
is
a
super
good
beer
for
this
time
of
the
year
the
one
thing
was
worried
about
was
that
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
sour
perhaps
things
like
this
are
what
introduces
people
to
the
real
sours
and
i
can
see
it
being
a
gateway
beer
for
me
nicely
down
founders
i
found
myself
gulping
this
beer
everytime
i
opened
another
bottle
just
kept
knocking
more
down
i
guess
i
have
the
minority
opinion
here
but
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
good
fruity
tart
sweet
genuine
cherry
character
maybe
not
much
traditional
beer
flavor
but
i
didnt
mind
o
quite
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
like
this
but
not
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
o
overall
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
ale
not
to
the
extent
of
some
other
world
class
cherry
brews
but
still
a
nice
sipper
for
a
hot
day
the
lack
of
robust
cherry
flavor
is
the
main
downfall
for
this
beer
overall
though
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
great
tasty
fruity
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
sting
on
the
tongue
goes
down
pretty
easily
and
is
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
not
a
favorite
but
this
is
a
style
im
starting
to
get
into
slightly
more
the
interesting
flavors
make
it
enjoyable
but
the
onedimensional
flavor
profile
takes
away
from
the
overall
quality
its
definitely
a
fruit
ale
focused
on
embodying
the
cherry
essence
but
its
a
bit
too
tart
for
my
liking
do
perhaps
an
above
average
fruit
beer
but
only
by
default
would
have
again
down
the
road
sometimes
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
for
thanks
mammothbrew
cerise
is
a
very
good
fruit
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
beers
like
this
but
founders
definitely
did
an
excellent
job
with
it
and
i
am
finding
myself
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
i
actually
think
i
like
this
much
better
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
though
that
was
years
ago
i
would
think
this
would
pair
very
well
with
a
creamy
dessert
o
good
cherry
beer
but
too
sweet
for
me
reminds
me
of
jollyrancher
beer
well
done
effort
though
the
ladies
will
like
this
one
to
me
cerise
is
a
good
demonstration
of
using
fruit
in
a
beer
to
give
it
a
balanced
flavor
without
being
sickeningly
sweet
or
unbearable
for
more
than
a
glass
i
could
easily
do
a
glass
or
two
in
a
row
without
becoming
burned
out
the
cut
of
the
tartness
and
well
carbonated
body
make
this
quite
drinkable
even
with
the
above
average
abv
range
a
nice
fruity
sweet
beer
for
the
summer
months
on
tap
at
the
beer
engine
cleveland
finally
got
around
to
rating
this
one
reddish
coloued
boy
a
little
retained
head
that
is
soapy
well
malted
down
only
somewhat
tart
cherry
taste
its
ok
and
thats
all
that
seems
intended
average
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
right
there
overall
an
average
fruit
beer
that
is
too
heavy
on
the
sweet
syrup
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
ive
had
better
cherries
o
a
good
beer
on
a
warm
day
but
one
of
my
least
favorite
offerings
from
founders
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
fruit
beer
it
certainly
is
worth
a
try
o
a
nice
cherry
brew
not
in
the
league
of
some
krieks
sours
or
flanders
reds
but
a
good
pick
here
easy
to
drink
and
find
o
its
ok
ill
stick
to
a
solid
hefe
or
wit
for
my
summer
beers
thanks
a
bitter
fruit
beer
yuck
not
sure
if
thats
what
they
intended
but
i
am
most
definitely
not
a
fan
of
this
it
has
an
odd
combination
of
flavors
that
just
dont
work
well
together
at
all
by
far
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
founders
compared
to
my
standard
for
cherry
beers
ng
wisconsin
belgian
red
this
isnt
on
the
same
planet
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
white
head
smell
is
pretty
mute
but
the
cherries
do
come
through
a
bit
taste
is
mostly
tart
cherry
with
pale
malt
bit
of
sweetness
that
becomes
much
more
prevalent
as
you
drink
more
of
the
beer
and
it
starts
to
taste
more
like
juicy
juice
than
beer
heavier
mouthfeel
than
i
would
have
figured
and
the
carbonation
is
lower
than
many
other
fruit
beers
finishes
very
clean
with
a
hint
of
dry
berry
overall
has
a
nice
drinkability
a
nice
beer
for
dessert
or
a
change
of
pace
not
a
regular
in
the
rotation
for
sure
i
am
not
a
raving
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
this
one
was
kind
of
different
the
cherries
are
definitely
there
but
theres
somehting
that
is
just
different
for
me
if
you
like
cherries
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
im
a
huge
fan
of
cherries
and
the
cherry
presence
is
authentic
but
the
sweetness
bring
this
one
down
a
tad
its
also
one
dimensional
for
the
most
part
but
its
a
beer
worth
trying
once
glad
i
tested
one
instead
of
gambling
on
the
four
pack
it
did
grow
on
me
a
little
i
did
finish
the
beer
but
i
would
try
something
else
before
having
again
i
feel
like
as
the
acidity
and
carbonation
faded
the
beer
improved
in
mouthfeel
and
taste
dpretty
drinkable
and
the
most
beery
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
pretty
wellrounded
and
drinkable
beer
o
out
of
all
the
founders
beers
ive
been
able
to
try
this
has
to
be
my
least
favorite
the
cherry
flavor
is
there
but
most
of
the
time
its
pretty
low
key
a
little
extra
tartness
would
have
been
nice
albeit
a
nice
summer
beer
o
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
fruit
beer
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
o
a
nice
fresh
tasting
fruit
beer
4
overall
an
interesting
beer
one
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
for
a
while
but
just
didnt
want
to
buy
multiple
bottles
found
this
as
a
single
in
a
store
so
i
scooped
it
up
it
is
becoming
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
this
and
in
the
future
i
would
like
to
share
it
with
my
father
who
loves
tart
cherries
while
having
some
vanilla
ice
cream
or
something
similar
as
it
sits
not
something
id
go
out
and
buy
just
to
drink
but
something
that
i
will
for
sure
try
again
eventually
when
the
moodtime
is
right
o
not
the
best
brew
from
founders
that
ive
had
but
pretty
decent
relative
to
all
the
other
disaster
fruit
brews
that
i
have
tried
o
founders
hits
another
outta
da
park
great
cherry
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
highly
recommend
and
will
buy
more
before
its
gone
o
im
not
a
convert
wouldnt
buy
a
6pack
but
im
glad
i
tried
this
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
for
the
style
nice
work
founders
overallnotes
certainly
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
though
my
experience
is
limited
while
this
wouldnt
go
on
my
list
of
favorite
brews
in
general
it
would
provide
a
nice
alternative
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
different
i
can
only
imagine
what
eating
a
cherry
pie
with
this
would
be
like
probably
would
cause
some
sort
of
overload
o
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
beer
i
was
not
blown
away
but
the
drinkability
is
very
high
would
be
really
easy
to
sit
back
and
throw
down
46
of
these
without
even
noticing
the
abv
level
6
5
glad
i
tried
it
once
the
wife
enjoyed
it
immensely
its
a
light
bodied
beer
and
goes
down
smooth
leaving
a
slight
pucker
in
my
lips
i
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
but
must
admit
its
not
my
style
im
a
beer
man
for
a
reason
and
this
comes
too
close
to
wine
or
champagne
for
me
props
to
founders
for
avoiding
any
artificial
or
medicinal
cherry
flavors
reddish
orange
with
a
pink
headyes
i
wish
the
head
had
stuck
around
longer
though
nose
is
tart
cherries
but
could
be
stronger
taste
is
tart
real
cherries
bready
malt
flavor
sweet
drying
finish
medium
bodied
not
overly
sweet
and
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
but
not
particularly
great
i
dont
know
that
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
very
good
the
cherries
come
through
and
dominate
the
carbonation
is
light
which
is
fine
some
beers
mention
the
fruit
used
in
the
brewing
process
but
disappoint
this
really
has
a
good
sweettart
cherry
flavor
this
definitely
doesnt
come
close
to
krieks
or
other
belgian
style
cherry
beers
but
as
an
american
fruit
beer
its
not
bad
a
bit
overly
sweet
but
when
paired
with
the
right
dessert
notably
chocolate
it
can
actually
be
very
good
that
said
drinking
a
whole
bottle
by
itself
is
not
really
an
enjoyable
experience
decent
with
dessert
but
once
again
a
bit
much
to
enjoy
in
quantity
all
on
its
own
it
is
quite
lightbodied
and
it
could
be
sessioned
if
one
really
enjoys
this
sort
of
product
for
someone
not
so
much
into
this
sort
of
brew
im
not
going
back
for
more
but
i
can
recognize
and
respect
the
quality
of
this
offering
overall
to
be
honest
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
guess
i
did
come
in
with
a
little
low
of
expectations
in
that
i
usually
dont
love
fruity
beers
and
lean
more
towards
the
deep
dark
and
rich
porters
and
stouts
but
this
one
did
impress
me
it
comes
through
on
everything
that
it
says
it
you
get
the
tart
cherries
on
both
the
smells
and
the
taste
that
finish
almost
sweet
with
a
nice
balance
of
malts
it
did
really
remind
me
of
a
glass
of
wine
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
as
well
a
great
fruity
beer
for
those
hot
summer
days
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
flavor
is
a
touch
sweet
which
lingers
until
the
aftertaste
big
michigan
pie
cherry
and
faintly
malty
breadiness
that
one
cant
help
but
associate
with
flaky
pie
crust
dry
finish
clean
and
not
cloying
at
all
low
level
astringency
similar
to
cherry
juice
this
is
very
tasty
provided
you
like
cherries
and
not
just
another
sweetened
fruit
beer
authenticity
reigns
leave
it
to
founders
to
brew
a
successful
michigan
cherry
ale
i
like
these
but
if
you
are
adverse
to
flavored
beers
i
would
not
recommend
them
to
you
i
had
a
4pack
last
year
at
first
i
wasnt
so
sure
about
such
a
concoction
but
this
is
the
second
year
in
a
row
i
have
come
to
appreciate
fruit
beer
the
other
really
good
cherry
beer
i
had
was
from
smuttynose
the
hanami
ale
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
unexpected
coming
from
founders
i
like
it
and
would
consider
buying
it
again
i
bet
this
would
make
a
great
beermosa
o
i
like
this
beer
this
beer
drank
a
little
more
like
a
cider
than
a
fruit
beer
i
would
give
it
another
go
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
not
founders
best
output
but
i
dont
hold
anything
against
them
the
cpj
o
quite
possibly
my
favorite
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
tastes
strongly
of
sweet
and
tart
cherries
but
is
pretty
balanced
incredibly
light
sweet
and
drinkable
the
more
i
drank
this
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
and
the
flavor
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
have
my
vote
to
rate
this
a
good
session
beer
and
change
of
pace
another
excellent
balancing
act
by
founders
as
they
continue
to
impress
me
with
fine
product
after
fine
product
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
like
fruit
beers
as
it
was
just
right
in
the
flavor
department
quite
a
balanced
brew
and
an
unheralded
winner
though
not
surprising
from
founders
overall
id
say
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
overall
actually
nice
and
refreshing
because
of
the
lighter
body
the
taste
that
isnt
overpoweringoverbearing
and
the
nice
carbonationmouthfeel
overall
i
think
id
give
it
a
3
5
out
of
5
0
definitely
not
my
favorite
beer
but
its
a
good
fruit
beer
nice
for
the
summertime
or
as
a
refreshing
break
from
stronger
beers
overall
a
nice
beer
but
enjoyed
more
from
tap
overall
very
good
fruit
beer
enjoyable
to
drink
though
i
never
want
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
overall
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
but
theres
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
or
make
me
want
to
buy
it
again
tasty
but
forgettable
o
might
be
a
good
summer
beer
for
people
that
dont
want
a
true
beer
taste
not
really
my
type
of
beer
overall
a
decent
brew
from
founders
i
would
pick
this
up
again
a
good
session
brew
in
between
ipas
overall
my
opinion
of
this
beer
is
changing
with
my
growing
palate
what
was
once
a
cloyingly
sweet
wine
knock
off
is
now
something
that
i
would
enjoy
having
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
around
the
bbq
if
i
tasted
this
blind
i
dont
think
id
have
said
it
was
beer
it
still
makes
for
a
pretty
nice
pour
and
a
good
change
of
pace
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
wouldnt
be
mad
if
offered
as
a
dessert
or
digestif
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
an
ok
beer
perhaps
a
transition
beer
for
those
not
into
craft
brews
or
wine
not
my
thing
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
fruit
beers
o
its
pretty
good
doesnt
look
or
smell
all
that
impressive
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
offer
it
some
backbone
definitely
not
disappointed
in
my
purchase
but
probably
wouldnt
repurchase
this
again
espeically
at
12
bucks
for
4
a
great
cherry
beer
not
strong
and
syrupy
like
a
kriek
but
instead
a
simple
fruit
beer
light
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
cherry
in
there
pours
slightly
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
nice
white
head
cherries
in
the
nose
but
not
too
pronounced
accompanied
by
light
malts
and
some
caramel
sugar
taste
of
sweet
cherries
with
a
tartness
following
and
a
smooth
maltiness
to
finish
off
and
just
a
bit
of
breadiness
mediumlight
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
minimal
head
on
it
there
is
a
weak
scent
of
wheat
and
some
cherry
but
nothing
too
bold
or
fruity
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
mixture
of
wheats
malts
and
sweet
cherries
that
are
again
not
too
bold
or
sweet
this
is
one
of
those
cherry
beers
that
has
a
good
cherry
flavor
but
doesnt
go
overkill
on
the
fruit
flavor
a
must
try
for
fruit
beer
lovers
overall
has
a
great
drinkability
but
too
tart
for
my
palate
also
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
but
have
to
respect
founders
brewery
for
their
brews
i
swear
i
came
close
to
making
a
beer
exactly
like
this
and
now
i
know
my
bench
mark
a
very
drinkable
beer
ill
take
another
please
o
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
to
get
an
honest
opinion
i
expected
tons
more
cherry
flavor
all
in
all
i
will
try
it
again
d
i
could
have
many
of
these
in
a
row
it
is
a
very
light
and
fluffy
beer
the
combination
of
all
the
factors
work
well
enough
to
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
this
style
is
not
necessarily
my
favorite
and
this
beer
is
rather
sweet
for
prolonged
drinking
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
usally
like
all
founders
beers
but
this
one
let
me
down
a
bit
again
its
completely
different
than
other
beers
so
keep
that
in
mind
dont
buy
this
and
expect
it
to
taste
like
a
cherry
wheat
sam
adams
or
cherry
stout
bells
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
not
my
favorite
cherry
beer
at
all
just
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
and
not
overthetop
great
on
that
dimension
like
some
others
i
e
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
almost
no
alcohol
presence
pretty
easy
drinking
and
id
return
to
this
occasionally
in
the
summer
but
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
highly
drinkable
there
is
no
smell
or
taste
that
is
offensive
though
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
pack
a
good
punch
it
hides
the
6
5
alcohol
well
good
stuff
4
pack
will
last
me
at
least
a
year
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
but
its
really
just
not
my
thing
i
would
drink
it
again
but
only
once
in
a
while
and
i
could
only
handle
1
per
sitting
good
with
spicy
food
the
overall
appearance
of
this
brew
is
an
amberpink
this
is
what
you
would
expect
of
a
drink
based
on
cherries
it
is
a
good
session
drink
however
as
it
warms
up
the
aftertaste
and
mouth
feel
is
degraded
by
the
sourness
of
the
brew
in
my
opinion
fruit
flavored
beers
are
either
hit
or
miss
but
i
would
recommend
this
beer
the
body
of
the
beer
was
pinkorange
and
cloudy
and
there
was
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
was
mild
with
only
a
hint
of
cherries
and
some
floral
aromas
as
well
the
taste
was
far
better
than
i
was
expecting
with
a
sour
sweet
taste
somewhat
evoking
a
lambic
or
a
flanders
red
but
without
any
funkiness
like
those
styles
the
beer
was
light
in
the
mouth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
dry
finish
the
sourness
made
this
much
more
interesting
than
other
fruit
beers
d
very
easy
to
drink
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
drinks
low
for
a
fruit
beer
would
make
a
nice
after
dinner
dessert
beer
but
id
prefer
to
split
a
bottle
rather
than
drink
it
all
to
myself
close
to
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
an
interesting
experiment
by
founders
some
work
really
well
some
dont
di
enjoyed
this
beer
all
the
way
through
and
it
kept
its
taste
very
well
it
was
unique
but
it
wasnt
unique
enough
that
ill
be
buying
it
again
any
time
soon
what
happens
when
you
mix
gold
and
rubies
this
beer
very
little
head
ring
stays
around
the
edge
of
the
snifter
smells
like
sweet
caramel
malts
and
cherries
not
much
complexity
but
its
nice
cherries
are
bigger
in
the
mouth
but
not
overwhelmingly
cloyingsyrupy
almost
there
though
bordering
on
new
glarus
territory
but
within
the
realm
idve
liked
a
little
more
tart
cherry
flavor
there
is
a
bit
but
most
of
it
is
drowned
out
in
the
excess
of
maltiness
pretty
good
split
a
bottle
2
ways
and
probably
wont
need
another
for
a
while
i
bet
it
would
make
a
great
dessert
companion
though
maybe
with
some
tiramasu
or
chocolate
d
this
is
more
of
a
warm
weather
brew
and
interesting
mix
between
a
fuller
medium
body
amber
ale
with
tart
fruit
notes
its
decent
but
i
doubt
id
be
grabbing
me
another
6
pack
of
this
be
interested
to
try
it
on
tap
however
readily
available
here
but
id
pick
other
fruit
beers
and
other
founders
brews
over
this
one
good
color
and
average
retention
and
lacing
smells
very
strongly
of
cherries
with
lots
of
background
sweetness
taste
is
way
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
bit
of
sourness
to
it
as
well
too
sweet
for
me
body
is
appropriately
medium
but
drinkability
is
low
for
me
because
of
that
overpowering
sweetness
dnice
enough
for
what
it
is
i
dont
need
to
try
it
again
rubaeus
was
one
of
my
favorite
if
not
my
favorite
american
fruit
beers
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
even
close
to
the
same
league
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
i
just
had
a
reviewable
sized
pour
of
this
but
i
was
greatly
impressed
delightfully
sour
slightly
sweet
this
is
a
great
one
this
isnt
a
session
beer
but
its
not
the
alcohol
thats
the
deal
breaker
rather
its
the
sweetness
and
pielike
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
this
great
after
dinner
sure
and
its
not
a
stout
either
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
another
one
of
these
on
a
holiday
night
after
dinner
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
beers
in
this
category
that
ive
tried
a
nice
surprise
indeed
many
thanks
to
illudiumq36
for
the
generous
trade
it
isnt
so
much
that
i
didnt
want
to
like
this
rather
my
wariness
about
the
style
led
me
to
even
doubt
that
founders
could
pull
a
gem
out
of
this
yet
this
brilliant
brewery
did
there
seems
to
be
nothing
that
founders
cannot
do
well
and
this
sweet
and
somewhat
tart
brew
is
no
exception
it
isnt
quite
my
style
but
i
wont
hesitate
to
grab
a
fourpack
of
these
if
the
mood
strikes
me
a
wonderful
surprise
the
beer
pours
to
a
reddish
chestnut
body
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
cherry
juice
and
malts
the
flavor
starts
off
with
sweet
and
tart
cherries
with
a
smooth
malt
body
almost
tastes
like
cherry
pie
with
that
malt
the
palate
is
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
mouth
watering
texture
really
works
probably
my
favorite
fruit
beer
so
far
time
to
expand
my
taste
profile
this
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
another
just
delicious
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
cherry
forward
without
being
a
belgian
which
is
unique
the
only
other
beer
that
ive
had
with
so
much
unadulterated
cherry
goodness
is
ng
belgian
red
both
are
great
beers
this
beer
pours
with
an
orange
color
with
a
reddish
tint
it
had
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
it
smells
like
you
would
expect
of
a
cherry
beer
with
nice
cherry
notes
and
a
bit
of
malt
character
the
taste
is
much
more
cherry
forward
with
dried
cherries
maybe
dried
apples
and
oddly
enough
a
bit
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
light
and
effervescent
very
refreshing
and
a
joy
to
drink
when
i
was
first
hit
with
the
aroma
i
was
expecting
the
taste
to
be
a
let
down
but
i
was
blown
out
of
the
water
with
the
flavor
the
malts
were
rich
and
sweet
while
the
cherries
were
mouth
puckeringly
tart
it
almost
felt
like
a
lambic
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
as
impressed
as
i
was
o
i
only
had
one
to
try
but
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
several
packs
of
this
next
season
to
share
with
friends
and
family
d
this
isnt
very
complex
but
it
has
a
decent
taste
and
is
quite
refreshing
this
is
a
fullflavored
fruit
beer
that
i
found
easy
to
enjoy
nothing
to
sneeze
at
just
because
its
a
fruit
beer
wouldnt
be
a
daily
pick
for
me
but
this
is
probably
better
than
most
in
its
category
because
you
know
founders
rules
md
medium
bodied
with
less
carbonation
than
expected
nice
sour
component
as
well
overall
it
is
a
well
made
beer
but
just
not
really
my
thing
i
like
it
but
would
never
want
more
than
one
d
decent
wouldnt
drink
much
more
than
the
bottle
i
had
in
one
sitting
6
5
makes
it
a
touch
strong
for
a
session
beer
though
a
bit
weak
for
a
wine
however
the
flavor
hides
all
of
the
alcohol
this
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
im
glad
that
i
only
grabbed
a
single
of
this
because
id
be
tempted
to
drink
these
one
after
another
i
think
i
have
a
new
favorite
cherry
beer
d
too
exotic
to
be
returned
to
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
styles
i
am
used
to
drinking
for
me
as
of
lately
it
seems
that
founders
can
do
no
wrong
and
this
beer
was
no
exception
this
beer
was
fun
to
drink
and
my
brother
liked
it
also
d
drinkability
isnt
very
good
its
flavorful
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
but
the
sugary
and
sour
combination
hurts
it
a
unique
offering
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
drinkability
nice
and
light
for
such
a
beer
good
drinkability
drinkabilty
for
a
hophead
or
stout
fan
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
a
nice
change
for
sure
a
dessert
beer
id
pick
up
a
6pack
annually
and
leave
it
at
that
wine
fans
notbeer
fans
would
enjoy
this
pretty
cool
and
different
but
im
1
and
done
medium
bodiedcarbed
mouthfeel
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
into
fruit
beers
especially
cherry
obviously
but
im
not
exactly
jonesin
for
another
it
a
very
nice
dark
cherry
like
aroma
that
is
not
overly
sweet
there
are
some
malt
and
hops
tones
to
the
aroma
as
well
the
head
disappears
quickly
down
to
a
thin
line
with
minimal
lace
the
body
has
dark
red
hue
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
the
beer
has
a
good
cherry
flavor
without
the
fruitiness
being
overly
present
there
is
a
fruity
bitterness
with
some
grain
esters
the
body
has
a
medium
and
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
drinkable
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
cant
wait
to
crack
open
the
others
in
the
4pack
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
fleeting
off
white
head
this
beer
is
amber
colored
the
aroma
is
cherries
and
malt
the
taste
is
tart
cherries
this
is
definitely
a
cherry
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
it
is
good
if
you
like
cherries
i
could
drink
this
occasionally
but
it
would
be
tough
to
pound
a
bunch
of
them
the
imaginary
antics
of
a
young
boy
and
his
friends
aside
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
nice
changeofpace
that
i
dont
need
to
have
too
often
but
that
i
would
certainly
be
willing
to
try
again
this
beer
pours
a
cranberry
red
clear
body
with
a
gentle
carbonation
of
tiny
bubbles
and
a
thin
bubbly
wisp
of
white
head
the
clean
soft
fruity
cherry
note
has
a
light
sweet
honey
note
that
grows
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
cherry
jam
aroma
that
finishes
the
sniff
as
the
beer
warms
the
bright
but
no
tart
taste
of
cherries
is
just
like
drinking
cherry
juice
with
a
slight
cherry
tart
pucker
in
the
finish
this
turns
to
a
soft
pomegranate
like
bite
in
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
little
fizz
that
keeps
the
finish
crisp
i
like
cherries
and
i
like
beer
but
this
is
nothing
but
cherry
juice
with
some
fizz
im
amazed
that
they
could
brew
this
with
out
any
beer
flavor
i
would
like
some
malt
or
hops
or
yeasty
flavors
to
support
the
cherry
flavor
a
little
bit
drinkability
this
one
is
drinkable
and
the
aboveaverage
alcohol
content
doesnt
really
come
into
play
however
i
just
didnt
find
it
to
be
that
tasty
or
remarkable
enough
in
any
other
respect
its
a
really
average
beer
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
very
drinkable
i
love
the
cherry
flavor
as
it
fades
from
sweet
to
tart
an
excellent
selection
for
the
home
pub
d
this
beers
drinkable
but
it
hasnt
given
me
an
excuse
to
want
more
of
it
its
not
offensive
by
any
means
but
theres
just
not
a
whole
lot
calling
me
back
to
this
brew
d
dessert
yummy
but
ive
had
better
fruit
beers
pours
a
hazy
deep
pink
color
with
a
light
pink
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
faint
dry
to
tart
cherry
in
the
taste
sugary
to
start
and
a
dry
tart
cherry
flavor
a
smooth
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
sugary
to
tart
dry
cherry
aftertaste
good
dry
to
tart
cherry
flavor
a
bit
sugar
but
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
expected
and
pretty
slick
but
features
some
nice
prickly
carbonation
on
the
tongue
i
could
probably
drink
another
but
im
glad
i
was
able
to
buy
a
single
and
dont
have
to
worry
about
consuming
a
whole
four
pack
pours
a
robust
red
into
a
snifter
with
very
little
head
smells
like
a
tart
cherry
and
little
else
besides
the
cherry
odor
is
rather
light
and
orchard
like
however
the
taste
is
of
tart
cherries
there
is
definitely
a
bit
of
pucker
to
this
drink
with
a
very
dry
aftertaste
almost
like
wine
it
tastes
remarkably
like
a
real
cherry
which
to
my
tastes
is
delightful
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
syrupy
or
sweet
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
would
love
to
try
this
with
some
fresh
fruit
or
a
suitable
dessert
i
could
really
drink
this
all
day
this
is
definitely
my
goto
fruit
beer
from
now
on
d
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
first
thought
is
not
to
fruit
a
beer
doubt
ill
pick
any
more
up
probably
my
least
favorite
founders
drink
some
may
look
at
this
as
a
really
weak
link
for
founders
but
i
feel
that
may
be
because
of
style
bias
because
this
really
is
a
solid
entry
for
a
fruit
beer
draft
enjoyed
this
as
the
st
paul
beer
fest
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pink
color
with
a
matching
pinkish
hued
head
the
smell
is
tart
cherry
right
of
the
bat
along
with
some
other
sweet
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
tart
cherries
that
slightly
pucker
your
mouth
are
at
the
forefront
lightmedium
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
as
i
have
never
tried
it
before
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
6
5
from
notes
taken
on
62510
beer
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
cherry
based
tartness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
it
finishes
cleanly
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
still
has
a
wheaty
kind
of
flavor
mild
bitterness
eh
it
kind
of
has
a
medicine
cherry
flavor
to
it
cheers
this
is
a
definite
midwest
experience
and
although
it
wasnt
my
favorite
i
appreciate
those
who
made
it
worthwhile
pours
a
reddish
orange
with
just
the
slightest
head
still
a
pretty
beer
smells
of
cherry
pie
filling
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
tad
of
maltiness
the
taste
is
of
sour
cherries
sweet
malt
spicy
cinnamon
and
a
hint
of
almond
probably
from
cherry
pits
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
but
i
like
the
sour
cherry
flavor
which
seems
real
not
at
all
artificial
tasting
slightly
spicy
and
relatively
crisp
in
the
mouth
pleasant
drinks
pretty
easy
but
not
enough
going
on
here
to
hold
me
for
than
a
few
better
than
most
fruit
beers
but
they
arent
in
the
same
league
a
new
glarus
fruitty
beers
imo
probably
one
of
a
few
founders
brews
that
doesnt
impress
me
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
necessarily
quench
as
much
as
youd
think
as
this
brings
the
sweet
cherry
juice
pretty
hard
i
like
it
i
just
dont
think
id
crave
it
da
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
relatively
drinkable
my
cerise
amore
sorry
this
brew
pours
a
clear
amber
copper
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
cherry
pie
i
thought
there
was
more
in
there
but
im
getting
nothing
now
but
these
bakery
items
odd
kinda
but
not
really
bad
at
all
the
taste
of
course
is
dominated
by
the
cherries
as
well
but
here
they
are
more
sour
more
medicinal
almost
faketasting
behind
the
cherries
theres
a
hint
of
nutmeg
coriander
and
some
very
soft
caramel
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
gooey
read
not
really
sticky
but
not
really
not
either
feel
overall
a
decent
fruit
beer
but
the
complete
package
just
doesnt
fully
come
together
here
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
sweetness
and
pucker
factor
while
i
really
enjoyed
this
glass
i
wouldnt
ask
for
two
in
a
row
overall
a
nice
surprise
really
enjoyed
how
crisp
and
refreshing
this
was
for
the
summer
certainly
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
founders
but
still
really
good
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
it
felt
a
little
syrupy
overall
though
drinkability
was
ok
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
and
a
little
too
reliant
on
the
cherry
juice
flavor
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
beer
flavors
to
come
through
though
if
someone
blindfolded
me
and
told
me
this
was
cherry
juice
instead
of
a
beer
id
definitely
believe
them
d
my
first
drainpour
ill
put
a
bucket
next
to
my
bed
tonight
just
in
case
poured
a
reddishorange
with
very
little
head
and
modest
lacing
the
nose
was
surprisingly
subtle
couldnt
pick
up
much
besides
a
distant
chocolate
and
tartness
the
flavor
however
was
a
different
story
big
malty
caramel
initially
giving
way
to
an
eventual
chocolatesour

great

nice
tickling
carbonation
and
very
easy
on
the
palate
the
main
thing
i
liked
was
this
ran
the
gambit
of
not
being
too
sweet
while
still
maintaining
6
5
alcohol
slightly
hazed
reddishorange
hue
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
quickly
dwindles
to
a
slim
bubbly
cap
a
moderately
subdued
aroma
of
cherries
and
warm
spices
improves
as
it
warms
up
loads
of
flavor
compared
to
the
nose
big
full
tart
cherry
sweetness
with
some
underlying
spice
and
a
hint
of
a
malt
base
less
spice
than
the
aroma
the
flavor
still
strikes
me
as
warm
its
a
comforting
beer
to
me
smooth
and
medium
bodied
yet
it
remains
refreshing
i
still
like
it
better
on
tap
though
mfd
overly
carbonated
the
minute
it
hits
the
tongue
dissipating
the
flavor
rather
quickly
founders
should
probably
stick
with
their
excellent
stouts

im
a
fan
founders
should
probably
stick
to
the
uber
stouts
how
about
alaskan
breakfast
stout
not
sure
ill
really
like
any
cherry
beer
when
ng
belg
red
is
around
drinkability
is
good
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
more
then
one
of
in
a
sitting
but
a
nice
way
to
end
a
meal
d
tasty
and
enjoyable
just
not
that
great
kind
of
artificial
in
the
cherry
department
rubeaus
was
better
but
this
year
is
better
then
last
year
an
amazing
intro
beer
and
a
great
one
for
i
the
picky
lady
i
wouldnt
have
this
with
more
than
potato
chips
or
pretzels
overall
i
still
may
favor
rubaeus
over
it
in
terms
of
taste
but
id
still
consider
this
a
pretty
good
beer
ambervery
light
red
color
with
a
decent
14
inch
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
cherry
juice
and
malt
with
no
real
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
the
malt
is
formidable
with
some
caramel
along
with
some
biscuit
flavors
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
cherry
presence
sharp
a
little
acidic
and
sweet
and
then
it
closes
back
in
on
the
biscuit
like
a
cherrybiscuit
i
dont
know
if
any
bakers
make
that
but
they
should
the
body
is
medium
to
medium
full
with
good
carbonation
on
the
whole
the
malt
bill
is
intriguing
for
a
fruit
beer
but
there
is
an
acidity
to
this
beer
that
grows
towards
the
finish
and
works
against
it
for
me
d
too
sweet
and
fruitforward
for
more
than
one
serving
of
this
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
as
a
dessert
drink
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
light
to
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
nothing
about
this
beer
stands
out
as
extraordinary
but
it
is
solid
and
worth
trying
nice
for
the
summer
months
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
good
white
head
and
good
lacing
that
receded
quickly
lively
fizzy
carbonation
and
strong
fruity
cherry
smell
taste
was
much
the
same
very
fruity
cherries
definitely
apparent
light
bodied
and
short
flavor
duration
very
crisp
and
refreshing
moderately
sweet
with
a
thin
texture
finish
is
lightly
sour
and
tart
very
good
brew
d
definitely
a
dessert
like
treat
kind
of
excited
to
try
it
with
the
ice
cream
this
will
be
my
first
nonstout
beer
float
i
like
the
access
to
a
cherry
beer
that
is
not
some
high
priced
cuvee
d
i
kind
of
got
sick
of
the
flavor
by
the
end
after
that
initial
anticipation
of
tasting
it
the
beer
got
dull
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
fruit
beers
but
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
d
light
crisp
and
refreshing
but
one
is
definitely
good
for
me
gets
a
bit
too
cloying
but
would
probably
make
a
great
dessert
pairing
a
rare
misfire
from
founders
for
me
d
sweetness
of
this
beer
makes
it
a
little
difficult
to
have
more
than
a
couple
that
being
said
a
great
dessert
beer
that
pairs
great
with
chocolate
covered
fruits
not
bad
for
what
it
is
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
other
cherry
fruit
beers
like
wisc
belg
red
d
this
would
seem
to
be
a
dessert
beer
or
a
predinner
beer
to
open
the
palate
tartness
is
nice
but
it
is
also
quite
sweet
one
will
do
the
trick
d
damn
surprise
surprise
another
winner
by
founders
this
is
an
exceptional
desert
beer
a
refreshing
summer
or
winter
brew
and
it
would
pair
nicely
with
a
great
many
things
not
to
mention
its
capacity
to
support
an
ice
cream
float
or
serve
as
a
base
for
a
cherry
reduction
outstanding
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
pinkish
tinge
and
a
thin
white
head
that
retains
ok
looks

last

aroma

tart
cherry

along
with
some

is
smooth
and
luxurious
and
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
an
intriguing
summer
beer
that
achieves
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
and
tastes
more
like
fruit
than
cough
syrup
unlike
some
other
fruit
beers
not
too
complex
but
tasty
drinkability
great
i
thought
this
would
be
a
one
and
done
experience
but
im
ready
for
another
and
i
dont
even
like
cherries
pours
a
nice
cherry
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
has
candied
cherries
and
straebweeires
but
not
much
else
a
big
fresh
cherry
presence
in
the
flavor
with
bit
of
tartness
that
keeps
a
nice
balance
to
the
beer
crisp
refreshing
body
tasty
fruit
beer
drinkability
refreshing
and
surprisingly
well
balanced
between
tart
and
sweet
honestly
it
is
about
time
i
find
a
cherry
beer
that
is
not
shockingly
tart
or
cloyingly
sweet
overall
this
may
be
my
least
favorite
founders
beer
but
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
which
i
guess
shows
how
much
i
love
founders
but
typically
dislike
fruit
beers
overall
very
drinkable
i
was
expecting
something
sweeter
and
fruitier
this
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
sour
or
farmhouse
its
a
good
beer
though
cherry
flavor
rounds
it
out
well
d
dangerously
drinkable
goes
down
like
a
fruit
juice
without
much
bite
at
all
really
enjoyed
this
one
my
wife
even
went
for
a
glass
pours
a
medium
hazy
peach
color
with
a
minimal
amount
of
somewhat
white
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
subtle
cherry
aromas
along
with
some
almond
and
a
little
honey
decent
cherry
pie
flavor
with
a
nice
tart
finish
was
expecting
more
fruit
in
this
one
along
the
lines
of
new
glarus
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
my
fourth
bottle
and
it
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
the
cherry
is
full
not
in
the
sickly
sweet
way
but
in
the
natural
gamey
way
d
this
is
a
delicious
brew
my
wife
gave
it
two
thumbs
up
i
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
over
founders
rubaeus
its
cherry
pie
like
taste
is
very
good
and
intriguing
it
makes
me
wonder
what
the
rubaeus
couldve
been
like
if
they
took
the
same
approach
d
verry
good
for
the
style
a
little
on
the
sour
side
db
the
price
was
the
standard
founders
seasonal
four
pack
price
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
but
not
overbearing
it
makes
it
a
one
bottle
at
a
time
thing
their
newaygo
county
and
last
years
version
of
this
one
had
more
cherry
flavor
fruit
varies
year
by
year
glad
i
tried
it
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
out
there
the
fruit
tastes
like
real
fruit
not
artificial
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
pink
with
even
carbonation
it
almost
looks
like
a
pink
cider
the
head
quickly
dissapates
from
the
middle
the
lacing
is
average
at
best
this
has
an
earthy
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
cherry
its
real
nice
because
its
not
overpowering
but
just
sort
of
teases
you
god
i
love
cherry
beers
this
one
has
a
cherry
taste
that
sneaks
up
on
you
for
the
first
two
seconds
after
you
sip
theres
nothing
and
then
it
just
explodes
in
your
mouth
sounds
like
a
tobias
funke
line
theres
just
enough
sour
at
the
end
to
cause
a
slight
pucker
maybe
i
should
carry
a
tape
recorder
around
and
listen
to
myself
this
is
great
super
light
mouthfeel
which
is
a
bit
of
a
downfall
if
it
was
a
bit
heartier
itd
be
a
top
5
for
me
really
high
drinkability
on
this
due
to
tasting
like
real
cherry
and
not
that
sweet
fake
cherry
flavor
i
want
another
all
ready
taste
is
onedimensional
but
interesting
enough
for
me
to
keep
wanting
more
good
level
of
cherry
flavornot
overpowering
and
not
just
a
component
of
the
flavor
drinkability
pretty
easy
drinking
though
could
not
tell
you
yet
how
many
of
these
i
would
want
or
have
in
sitting
but
i
do
think
do
to
the
great
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
its
not
very
super
sweet
which
is
certainly
a
good
thing
for
drinkability
purposes
the
cherries
are
certainly
noticeable
but
more
for
the
sweet
and
sour
then
really
pure
cherry
to
me
anyway
a
nice
interesting
beer
thats
got
more
abv
then
you
would
think
drinking
and
certainly
goes
down
fast
worth
a
shot
for
sure
all
in
all
this
brew
is
pretty
good
better
than
i
expected
as
most
fruit
beers
have
disappointed
me
good
to
try
if
you
like
your
brews
sweet
copper
colored
brew
small
white
head
good
amount
of
lace
smells
like
sweet
cherries
mmm
tastes
like
sweet
cherries
if
you
like
cherries
and
you
like
beer
i
reckon
you
might
like
this
cause
it
tastes
like
beer
soaked
in
cherries
not
overly
sweet
thin
mouth
i
like
dthere
is
just
not
enough
going
on
with
this
brew
to
get
too
excited
about
it
just
average
for
this
style
d
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
it
would
seem
a
cherry
beer
could
be
more
interesting
drinkable
but
for
now
this
is
the
weakest
founders
offering
ive
tried
d
well
not
hard
to
drink
but
i
dont
want
this
again
would
rather
have
a
beer
that
doesnt
taste
so
much
like
a
fruit
drink
d
the
beer
is
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
its
a
pretty
good
beer
for
this
particular
style
d
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
would
even
like
this
beer
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
buy
i
would
buy
this
again
d
easily
drinkable
and
i
enoyed
it
much
more
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
the
price
per
4
pack
is
alot
more
than
i
plan
on
spending
again
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
w
my
score
drinkability
might
be
a
little
below
average
the
flavor
is
great
but
its
lacking
in
other
areas
if
the
finish
was
tweaked
and
improved
it
would
be
more
sessionable
but
even
then
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
try
just
not
the
kind
i
want
many
of
i
would
buy
this
again
but
it
will
probably
be
next
year
before
i
do
recommended
once
every
season
its
offered
drinkability
well
done
fruit
beer
d
this
is
pretty
decent
it
had
a
good
cherry
flavor
but
definitely
one
dimensional
nice
too
try
though
drinkable
but
why
bother
just
drink
a
cherry
soda
and
add
vodka
d
pretty
solid
beer
overall
impression
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
to
date
i
always
wanted
to
try
it
but
i
didnt
want
to
buy
a
4pack
i
put
together
a
mixed
6pack
and
this
was
one
of
them
im
glad
i
tried
it
you
should
too
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
tart
on
the
tongue
with
a
lasting
tartness
in
the
finish
almost
mouthpucker
inducing
carbonation
is
high
but
works
well
with
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
this
one
could
grow
old
after
about
three
or
four
sessioned
consecutively
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
took
a
chance
by
buying
a
case
for
20
but
i
think
these
will
go
down
just
fine
especially
in
the
warmer
months
ahead
i
really
good
fruit
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
this
would
be
delicious
on
a
summer
day
while
its
not
new
glarus
or
cantillon
its
still
a
fine
fruitdessert
beer
very
light
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
the
initial
burst
of
sweetness
borders
on
being
overwhelming
but
stops
just
shy
of
that
it
may
be
low
on
abv
and
ibus
but
its
still
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
horrible
fruit
beer
it
should
not
be
consumed
a
lawnmower
beer
for
you
and
your
wife
she
is
sure
to
like
it
and
if
she
doesnt
take
a
trick
from
founders
themselves
and
mix
it
half
and
half
with
a
lemonade
and
you
two
will
both
have
something
to
sit
around
the
pool
with
on
fourth
of
july
not
over
powering
cherry
just
enough
hadnt
had
this
one
before
and
i
have
to
try
anything
by
founders
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
cerise
is
a
hazy
amberorange
color
with
a
thin
almost
nonexistent
head
the
nose
is
all
tart
cherry
really
not
much
else
going
on
there
the
taste
is
also
mostly
all
cherries
the
tart
cherry
seems
to
be
a
better
pick
for
a
beer
because
it
doesnt
have
that
sickeningly
sweetness
that
a
sweet
cherry
would
have
this
is
however
a
pretty
sweet
beer
but
the
tartness
helps
keep
that
in
check
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
a
mouth
puckering
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
a
decently
done
beer
one
of
the
better
cherry
beers
ive
had
but
for
a
founders
beer
a
little
disappointing
worth
trying
though
nice
crisp
body
yet
subtly
smooth
flavors
of
tart
cherries
but
nothing
puckering
also
some
honeykissed
biscuits
and
the
faintest
of
hops
bitterness
is
low
this
was
quite
refreshing
and
surprisingly
drinkable
not
bad
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
rated
b
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
fruit
beer
good
beer
i
liked
it
d
not
my
style
of
beer
for
me
one
is
enough
but
it
is
an
interesting
beer
worthy
of
a
try
overall
a
great
ale
from
founders
next
to
the
pale
ale
and
scottish
ale
respectively
i
could
drink
this
every
week
d
not
a
bad
cherry
beer
could
have
used
a
bit
more
sourness
and
something
to
fill
out
the
body
after
the
initial
taste
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
wine
glass
lots
of
carbonation
after
the
pour
but
the
head
disappears
seconds
later
this
beer
is
not
horrible
it
is
just
different
not
much
of
a
scent
at
all
the
taste
is
overly
sweet
and
honey
like
in
nature
the
aftertaste
has
a
somewhat
small
tart
cherry
like
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
do
not
really
have
desire
to
drink
another
one
of
these
right
now
or
anytime
in
the
near
future
d
i
love
this
beer
but
one
glass
is
enough
just
a
tad
too
sweet
to
be
an
easy
drinker
the
cherry
flavors
pair
well
with
mild
cheeses
and
fruity
desserts
founders
really
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
and
this
is
proof
the
fruitiest
and
strangest
brew
still
tastes
great
a
nicely
done
fruit
beer
pretty
drinkable
but
one
or
two
would
be
enough
for
most
people
if
you
like
cherry
in
your
beer
youll
enjoy
this
a
tasty
fruit
beer
but
a
fruit
beer
nonetheless
one
of
these
with
some
cherry
pie
or
black
forest
cake
would
be
nice
but
beyond
that
im
not
sure
i
could
down
anymore
md
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
but
the
only
thing
keeping
both
of
these
categories
is
that
the
sweetness
will
get
to
you
quickly
pours
a
ruby
red
color
that
is
slightly
hazy
and
has
some
visible
chunks
in
it
there
is
a
frothy
head
that
is
fizzy
and
gives
way
to
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
of
cherries
over
a
sweet
malt
backbone
the
cherry
taste
is
very
unique
and
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
moderately
carbonated
and
slightly
fizzy
overall
though
the
drinkability
on
this
is
very
high
if
you
dont
like
cherries
i
would
stay
away
if
you
like
cherries
or
are
looking
for
something
different
you
could
drink
these
all
nite
d
good
drinkability
not
too
sweet
or
cloying
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
light
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
d
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
fruit
beer
very
nice
overall
cherry
flavor
seems
perfect
for
desert
really
think
this
would
be
great
with
some
chocolate
cake
a
brownie
sundae
or
such
good
by
itself
not
one
i
could
have
a
few
of
in
one
session
but
with
chocolate
deserts
outstanding
a
well
balanced
and
toned
down
tartened
sweet
cherry
beer
that
may
be
a
good
starter
fruit
beer
for
those
not
quite
ready
for
the
big
sour
brews
out
there
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
on
the
same
night
and
recommend
this
to
those
who
enjoy
cider
and
want
a
fruity
twist
d
its
easy
to
finish
a
beer
but
more
than
one
is
too
much
cherry
for
me
overall
a
decent
brew
it
was
cheap
interesting
flavor
you
dont
have
every
day
not
a
super
complex
taste
though
its
worth
a
try
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
but
im
still
just
scratching
the
surface
with
this
style
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
never
disappears
completely
smells
of
cherries
sour
cherries
faint
perfume
and
a
brown
sugar
malt
sweetness
taste
is
a
puckering
tart
cherry
up
front
and
sweet
malt
with
a
syrupy
sweet
lingering
cherry
flavor
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
one
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
done
fruit
beer
i
love
cherries
but
sometimes
fruit
beers
can
be
well
overfruited
dcherries
really
have
an
opportunity
to
shine
making
this
one
interesting
if
in
only
low
volumes
watermelon
hued
body
topped
by
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
loose
and
broken
collection
of
foam
islands
cherry
aroma
is
evident
without
getting
too
close
to
the
glass
a
closer
sniff
reveals
a
more
balanced
cherry
and
malt
aroma
occasionally
i
still
get
the
hint
of
swedish
fish
candy
flavor
is
predominantly
cherry
but
there
is
a
nice
biscuit
malt
flavor
overall
this
is
a
very
light
tasting
beer
hints
of
bitterness
pop
in
briefly
on
the
finish
the
beer
gets
more
and
more
refreshing
as
i
continue
to
quaff
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
it
works
well
i
think
a
thick
bodied
beer
would
get
tiring
and
cloying
with
this
amount
of
cherry
flavor
drinkability
is
very
good
i
find
myself
wanting
another
poured
a
reddish
hue
hints
of
brown
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
lace
ring
on
top
of
a
decent
sourtart
fruit
smell
and
hints
of
malt
minor
hop
bitterness
and
sharp
tartsour
fruit
tastes
that
is
alright
but
slightly
offbalance
some
sticky
malt
is
in
this
beer
but
it
is
mostly
a
tart
fruit
a
decent
ale
with
minor
sweetness
but
a
little
too
tart
for
me
to
drink
all
the
time
poured
a
pinkish
color
out
of
the
bottle
with
good
carbonation
but
once
it
settled
it
was
deep
cranberry
color
nose
is
all
cherries
very
sweet
and
sugary
cherries
taste
is
more
of
the
same
very
sweet
ripe
cherries
very
tart
on
taste
and
mouthfeel
one
will
be
enough
to
drink
d
this
surprised
me
in
a
really
good
way
i
see
a
lot
of
similarities
to
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
which
is
a
huge
thumbs
up
from
me
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
most
definitely
purchased
again
d
well
it
isnt
even
close
to
new
glarus
belgian
red
which
is
just
about
as
close
to
intense
as
this
style
gets
good
refreshing
but
the
large
amount
of
sediment
about
freaked
me
out
drinkability
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
but
a
wellexecuted
fruit
beer
that
blends
both
sweet
and
tart
flavors
nicely
together
pours
a
reddishpink
mixed
with
a
wee
bit
of
brown
the
aroma
is
that
of
tart
cherries
with
hints
of
sweetness
the
taste
brings
out
even
more
cherry
flavor
coming
full
on
at
your
palate
there
is
a
slight
tartness
to
it
as
well
medium
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
a
fantastic
fruit
beer
d
quite
drinkable
and
quenching
i
could
easily
drink
several
and
be
content
tastes
just
as
nice
and
tame
as
it
smells
the
berrycherry
blend
reaches
a
nice
balance
between
sour
and
sweet
and
like
most
good
fruit
beers
it
starts
off
juicy
and
finishes
smooth
and
creamy
refreshing
but
theres
not
enough
going
on
in
the
middle
and
end
to
make
it
a
really
great
fruit
beer
ok
im
over
the
fact
that
im
drinking
a
pink
beer
the
beer
is
also
good
enough
to
comfortably
drink
in
public
yea
its
pink
asshole
but
it
tastes
better
than
your
piss
water
however
i
think
one
bottle
at
a
time
will
do
it
its
too
sweet
for
more
than
one
at
a
time
pours
a
hazy
ruby
red
really
neat
fruity
colour
almost
grapefruit
like
thick
slightly
off
white
head
forms

to
a

without
the
complexity
founders
proves
to
me
once
again
that
they
are
worthy
of
being
one
of
my
top
favorite
breweries
the
main
downfall
of
this
beer
is
that
you
cant
taste
any
form
of
beer
in
it
which
at
15
ibus
isnt
that
surprising
i
guess
i
am
admittedly
biased
to
start
with
considering
that
fruit
beers
arent
my
favorite
to
begin
with
however
this
is
not
the
best
of
its
style
and
is
my
least
favorite
founders
effort
to
date
single
bottle
copped
from
joe
canals
in
lawrenceville
cherry
pureeladen
aroma
combined
with
authentic
fruit
flavor
imparts
a
refreshing
and
subtle
brew
with
a
moderate
6

abv
interesting
stuff
from
founders
although
not
a
particular
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
i
will
give
credit
where
its
due
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
not
buy
again
reddish
copper
pour
with
a
small
layer
of
head
tartness
present
on
the
nose
with
fresh
cherries
and
hints
of
alcohol
taste
is
moderately
tart
and
surprisingly
subtle
the
cherries
present
are
very
fresh
and
ripe
tasting
and
there
is
a
slight
acidity
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
this
one
has
a
nice
flavor
but
isnt
too
bold
a
decent
fruit
beer
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
in
this
case
done
well
pours
a
hazy
pink
amber
not
quite
as
strikingly
pink
as
some
red
fruited
beers
but
its
rosy
the
dissipating
head
is
whitish
with
hints
of
pink
as
well
aromas
of
cherry
are
noticed
immediately
without
bringing
the
glass
to
the
nose
though
it
is
not
overwhelming
along
with
the
sweet
and
mildly
tart
fruit
is
some
malt
but
no
hops
the
tartness
is
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
it
is
rather
natural
tasting
and
there
is
a
little
malt
flavor
but
it
seems
to
be
here
mostly
for
structure
it
finishes
dry
thankfully
with
a
little
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
dont
care
to
drink
more
than
this
one
as
i
am
craving
more
traditional
beer
flavor
fine
for
a
fruit
beer
but
lacks
complexity
perhaps
one
to
offer
to
those
less
enthusiastic
about
beer
as
a
segue
into
craft
offerings
d
you
definitely
wont
like
it
if
you
have
an
aversion
to
cherries
but
its
not
syruplike
at
all
a
good
desert
beer
or
fruity
summer
drink
well
balanced
and
brewed
d
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
i
like
it
not
something
i
would
regularly
seek
out
but
definitely
tasty
enjoyable
to
drink
dyou
had
best
like
tart
cherries
or
this
beer
will
fail
you
the
rubaeus
of
cherry
brews
tart
lightly
sweet
crisp
and
refreshing
nicely
done
founders
overall
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
solid
cherry
beer
worth
a
shot
if
youre
in
the
mood
oelergud
drinkability
is
average
there
are
some
nice
aspects
but
overall
its
just
a
bit
too
much
and
a
slow
sipper
for
me
one
and
done
for
sure
but
nevertheless
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rose
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
cherries
sweet
and
tart
taste
like
it
smells
more
tart
than
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
effort
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy

poured
a

with
a

that
immediately
dispersed
into
a

and
some
clusters

around
the
edges
of

some
spots
of

fairly
weak

mild

slightly
tart

and
a
wheat

taste
consistent
with

sweet
up

and
tart
towards

as
well
as
some
artificial

the

profile
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
with
a
consistent
background
effervescence
some
astringency
in
the
mix
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
interesting
beer
but
one
was
sufficient
conclusion
good
flavor
but
not
enough
of
it
better
than
the
average
fruit
beer
for
sure
but
doesnt
approach
a
good
kriek
or
new
glarus
offering
paired
nicely
with
a
chocolate
bourbon
mousse
cake
i
really
wish
this
brew
was
more
dry
and
finished
with
a
dry
spumantetype
finish
but
see
what
you
think
id
buy
a
single
and
stay
away
from
the
4pack
unless
you
have
friends
who
might
enjoy
okay
paying
4
50
for
a
single
i
said
this
better
be
good
then
i
saw
average
reviews
and
lowered
my
expectations
good
thing
because
this
beer
isnt
bad
at
all
i
know
i
have
not
tried
wisconsin
belgian
red
but
this
is
what
i
would
expect
nice
sour
notes
and
enough
cheery
flavor
to
hit
the
spot
not
sure
of
any
realy
flaws
founders
always
does
it
right
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orangecopper
color
and
formed
a
small
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
is
quickly
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
sour
cherries
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
sour
cherries
it
had
a
medium
light
body
and
the
finish
was
sweet
and
sour
but
not
easy
on
the
pocketbook
with
the
2
50
a
bottle
pop
and
for
a
low
alcohol
brew
ill
probably
pass
on
this
in
the
future
d
this
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
only
drink
one
per
session
it
might
go
well
if
pared
with
something
this
is
something
im
finding
with
sweeter
beers
worth
the
experience
poured
a
medium
reddishpinkish
color
with
an
average
sized
frothy
pinkish
head

of
cherries

of
cherries
cherry
pie
pie
crust
and
bready
on

sweeter
side
with
a
lighter

finish
but
definitely
leans
towards
the
sweeter
side
pinkish
lacing
left
on
the
glasss
d
easy
enough
to
drink
fun
and
not
all
that
tiring
sort
of
a
chick
beer
i
guess
i
felt
it
was
worth
a
try
but
nothing
that
really
connected
for
me
if
you
dont
like
overly
sweet
beers
maybe
youd
like
this
but
i
thought
it
could
have
used
more
flavor
poured
a
reddish
amber
and
you
could
smell
the
strong
cherryness
easily
it
had
a
decentbodied
mouthfeel
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
cherry
flavor
was
just
too
much
it
tasted
as
if
it
was
half
grenadine
and
was
just
entirely
too
sweet
for
me
as
for
the
poster
than
referred
to
it
as
a
chick
drink
or
even
as
dessert
itself

anything
its

i
kind
of
like
the
lack
of
being
highly
carbonated
this
could
be
quite
possibly
the
easiest
drinking
beer
ive
ever
come
across
you
could
really
put
this
away
without
even
thinking
about
it
i
would
like
a
few
other
flavors
to
make
it
a
bit
more
complex
this
has
been
slightly
reformulated
and
bottled
as
founders
summer
offering
philbe3110
decent
beer
i
enjoyed
the
novelty
this
is
easily
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
and
for
the
price
never
again
will
i
buy
any
voodoo
series
beers
light
bodied
thinner
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
unique
dessert
beer
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
just
like
the
whole
voodoo
doughnut
line
of
beers
but
thats
ok
it
would
taste
worse
if
this
were
highly
hopped
looked
and
smelled
good
but
had
zero
body
and
a
horrible
taste
glad
i
only
got
one
i
liked
it
just
fine
couldnt
rate
it
anything
other
than
poor
without
a
review
which
is
stupid
banana
esters
peanut
butter
in
aroma
chocolate
with
lightly
fruity
notes
flavor
is
similar
with
a
bitter
finish
theres
an
off
fruity
and
floral
tone
peanut
butter
lingers
in
aftertaste
it
tastes
like
banana
flavored
runts
that
horrible
candy
developed
in
the
80s
d
some
may
get
a
kick
out
of
this
wacky
beer
for
me
its
a
bust
the
voodoo
is
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
dark
with
thin
ecru
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
carried
hershey
like
chocolate
and
banana
bread
not
getting
much
peanut
butter
the
taste
was
mostly
weak
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
which
for
this
beer
style
i
would
prefer
a
medium
to
fuller
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
its
interesting
and
not
over
the
top
i
popped
off
the
oxygenfixing
cap
and
gave
each
of
us
a
generous
pour
following
the
pseudocascade
i
had
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
solid
darkbrown
srm

although
they
identified
it
as
75
lovibond
i
have
a
handle
on
srm
so
i
am
not
going
to
try
to
learn
lovibond
unless
i
have
to
nose
definitely
gave
off
banana
esters
but
accompanied
by
a
maple
syrup
and
an
odd
frieddoughnut
quality
i
was
now
gearing
up
for
unrelenting
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
taste
was
sweet
all
right
but
chocolate
and
banana
were
about
it
finish
was
likewise
sweet
and
the
peanut
butter
made
a
brief
appearance
at
the
end
but
it
might
as
well
have
had
an
asterisk
next
to
it
on
the
label
for
as
much
as
it
mattered
a
definite
novelty
i
appreciate
the
innovation
and
the
idea
and
the
other
two
of
these
have
been
downright
delicious
and
well
done
but
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
miss
some
age
on
the
bottle
so
maybe
my
banana
has
faded
but
i
didnt
taste
it
at
all
worse
i
didnt
get
any
peanut
butter
maybe
a
slight
generic
nuttiness
but
nothing
but
a
greasy
texture
and
some
sweet
malt
on
this
for
me
chocolate
yes
its
all
in
the
nose
and
finish
but
the
sweet
grain
makes
it
tough
to
appreciate
all
the
way
i
get
no
banana
whatsoever
not
even
from
the
yeast
which
may
have
been
the
best
way
to
get
those
esters
in
here
worse
yet
its
alcoholic
and
not
even
that
strong
it
stings
and
it
stinks
i
just
dont
care
for
it
as
it
finishes
i
get
a
little
more
of
the
peanut
butter
but
its
not
really
compatible
like
it
is
in
other
beers
that
have
come
around
its
contrived
not
real
genuine
and
just
a
sloppy
mess
of
flavors
that
never
gel
it
may
have
been
better
when
it
first
came
out
but
its
well
past
being
reasonable
i
will
likely
keep
buying
these
beers
only
out
of
curiosity
but
this
is
the
worst
of
the
three
by
far
overall
not
awful
but
i
dont
think
id
get
this
beer
again
but
i
know
whenever
rogue
does
a
new
voodoo
doughnut
beer
ill
be
sure
to
try
it
out
of
curiosity
o
judging
by
the
ratings
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
i
actually
liked
it
the
mouthfeel
was
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
as
it
was
way
to
thin
still
enjoyable
overall
ok
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
thick
head
initial
smell
is
a
little
sweet
not
a
strong
smell
so
i
take
another
whiff
and
the
first
thought
is
that
the
smell
is
off
putting
a
big
turn
off
smell
is
very
artificial
taste
has
no
sweetness
at
all
i
cant
detect
any
banana
peanut
butter
or
chocolate
then
i
look
at
the
label
and
it
says
donut
then
i
try
to
imagine
this
beer
as
a
donut
starts
to
make
a
little
sense
but
i
cant
get
over
the
off
putting
artificial
smell
the
smell
is
very
familiar
similar
to
a
wells
beer
the
only
thing
going
for
this
is
the
cool
pink
painted
bottle
this
beer
is
not
worth
the
10
i
paid
o
the
banana
is
very
overpowering
i
would
like
to
have
seen
more
chocolate
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
this
was
a
drain
pour
o
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
because
it
has
been
talked
about
around
here
for
the
past
few
months
and
i
was
let
down
a
little
bit
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
drinking
this
straight
out
of
the
fridge
its
extremely
closed
and
bitter
but
let
that
bugger
sit
for
1015
minutes
and
its
like
drinking
a
saturday
morning
the
flavors
come
alive
and
mix
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
is
there
initially
but
dissipates
quickly
and
the
end
does
come
across
as
a
tad
watery
but
i
still
feel
this
is
a
good
interesting
beer
to
try
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
i
could
certainly
drink
it
on
occasion
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
very
good
especially
coming
from
rogue
but
it
was
interesting
wouldnt
bother
drinking
it
again
overall
its
a
good
different
taste
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
the
chocolate
banana
lover
overall
i
liked
it
and
would
drink
it
again
different
but
unique
in
a
good
way
o
i
am
really
going
against
the
tide
with
this
rating
but
i
really
liked
it
was
it
disappointing
yes
can
i
see
why
some
might
find
the
idea
of
it
disgusting
yes
ultimately
i
feel
like
the
flavors
just
werent
strong
enough
and
didnt
blend
right
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
overall
i
like
it
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
overall
the
beer
is
kind
of
a
train
wreck
but
it
is
so
interesting
and
all
over
the
place
that
it
was
at
least
fun
to
review
but
im
not
sure
they
got
the
ingredients
right
at
all
peanut
butter
was
missing
and
the
banana
tasted
more
like
strawberries
oops
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
brown
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
cocoa
and
peanut
butter
the
overall
taste
is
very
malty
mixed
with
some
cocoa
flavors
it
finishes
with
a
chalky
after
taste
an
interesting
style
and
advertised
ingredients
but
it
could
taste
a
lot
better
overall
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
actually
been
tempted
to
break
my
nodrainpour
rule
this
beer
easily
takes
the
prize
for
the
worst
beer
from
a
craft
brewery
that
i
have
come
across
poured
into
a
pint
glass
showed
a
beautiful
brownblack
ale
small
tan
head
on
the
second
pour
which
left
nice
lace
but
went
away
quickly
the
aroma
was
banana
before
pouring
chocolate
after
being
poured
and
on
the
second
pour
was
chocolate
banana
mix
taste
went
a
little
on
the
same
lines
with
chocolate
coming
out
first
and
stronger
banana
on
the
second
pour
with
bitter
chocolate
as
a
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
more
like
a
stout
than
a
ale
but
since
chocolate
is
in
this
i
guess
one
should
see
that
coming
low
carbanation
also
sways
to
a
stout
style
overall
the
fact
that
i
never
got
any
peanutbutter
in
this
was
kind
of
a
let
down
really
enjoyed
the
maple
bacon
offering
and
always
wait
for
the
flavors
to
come
out
as
it
warms
while
as
a
whole
this
got
better
as
it
warmed
but
no
peanutbutter
ever
surfaced
prost
lampertland
oi
am
actually
disappointed
with
rogue
its
one
thing
to
make
a
bad
beer
its
another
to
get
our
hopes
up
with
such
an
itruiging
name
its
not
as
if
its
a
terrible
beer
but
its
definitely
not
worth
buying
i
tasted
this
blind
and
have
a
feeling
this
will
be
right
up
there
with
my
most
positive
deviations
from
the
norm
but
i
found
this
an
outstandingly
idiosyncratic
beer
amazing
flavours
just
socking
you
all
right
up
in
your
tastebuds
no
regrets
no
complaints
i
appreciate
the
attempt
at
innovation
but
this
endeavor
was
a
tall
order
to
say
the
least
its
hardly
a
success
by
my
account
but
few
would
have
succeeded
given
the
demands
voodoo
doughnut
is
the
epitome
of
a
novelty
beer
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
novelty
beer
thats
probably
not
worth
the
asking
price
but
the
contents
of
the
bottle
are
not
entirely
wretched
there
are
far
more
gimmicky
ales
out
there
and
considering
the
blatant
use
of
artificial
sorry
natural
flavours
this
could
be
so
much
worse
still
rogue
makes
beers
that
are
so
much
better
spend
your
money
on
those
not
this
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
was
a
bit
tough
to
down
a
whole
22oz
bomber
but
in
smaller
samples
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
i
appreciate
the
originality
and
creativity
of
it
bottle
poured
a
deep
dark
color
ale
with
a
small
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
almost
no
retention
aroma
of
light
peanut
butter
notes
with
some
fake
banana
syrup
notes
is
not
the
most
pleasant
taste
is
also
dominated
by
gross
banana
notes
with
light
peanut
butter
notes
with
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugars
body
is
light
with
light
carbonation
too
much
banana
notes
for
its
own
good
and
also
too
sweet
for
my
own
taste
buds
dark
brown
almost
cola
in
color
sparse
head
that
sits
like
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
not
very
inviting
the
combo
of
chocolate
banana
and
peanut
butter
sounds
good
on
paper
but
becomes
a
garbled
mess
throw
in
some
licorice
to
boot
and
i
am
suddenly
not
interested
at
all
very
thin
textured
and
not
enough
carbonation
which
ruins
the
mouthfeel
for
me
metallic
finish
this
beer
could
probably
benefit
from
a
bigger
malt
profile
taste
is
umm
weird
i
get
more
of
the
peanut
butter
some
banana
and
only
a
hint
of
the
chocolate
an
interesting
novelty
taste
not
altogether
offensive
or
unfaithful
to
the
premise
but
certainly
not
a
beer
with
lasting
value
or
drinkability
worst
tasting
beer
i
have
has
in
quite
some
time
not
putrid
or
vile
enough
to
drain
pour
but
it
sure
tries
hard
kind
of
makes
you
wonder
if
they
are
even
tasting
this
stuff
before
going
public
overall
this
was
really
quite
an
enjoyable
novelty
brew
while
somewhat
artificial
in
banana
it
had
a
nice
candy
like
smell
and
flavor
that
melded
well
with
the
darker
and
roasted
doughnut
like
characteristics
of
the
brew
while
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
voodoo
doughnut
maple
bacon
ale
the
voodoo
doughnut
chocolate
banana
and
peanut
butter
ale
is
delicious
and
even
although
it
is
rather
overpriced
it
is
one
you
should
likely
try
at
least
once
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
between
the
acrid
roastiness
and
the
intense
hoppiness
on
the
finish
it
was
a
rather
tough
session
at
its
pricepoint
this
should
have
been
far
better
i
enjoy
this
very
much
and
it
one
of
my
normal
drinker
o
i
dont
know
what
exactly
they
brewed
with
to
get
these
flavors
but
what
the
hell
if
you
stripped
off
the
chocolate
and
peanut
from
the
label
i
wouldnt
even
know
they
were
supposed
to
be
represented
what
a
mess
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
milk
chocolate
peanut
butter
roasted
malt
and
some
banana
it
tastes
like
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
banana
peanut
butter
burntcharred
malt
and
a
bit
of
caramel
i
do
think
the
chocolate
flavor
is
stronger
compared
to
the
banana
and
peanut
butter
it
does
lean
more
towards
being
a
sweeter
tasting
brew
than
a
bitter
roasty
one
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
coating
and
is
well
carbonated
overall
i
liked
this
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
in
the
future
its
certainly
a
unique
beer
and
its
definitely
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
before
overall
boo
indeed
i
quite
enjoyed
the
maple
bacon
beer
despite
what
everyone
else
seemed
to
think
of
it
but
this
is
pisspoor
this
is
thin
fakely
flavoured
and
weak
without
any
integration
or
any
particular
thought
put
to
it
very
uninspiring
stuff
im
sad
about
this
beer
i
wanted
to
think
that
people
are
dumb
and
are
just
drinking
the
haterade
but
this
isnt
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
again
its
thin
and
comes
off
as
fake
they
should
sweeten
the
beer
a
bit
and
maybe
use
more
chocolate
more
peanut
butter
and
less
banana
thats
my
recommendation
theres
no
banana
or
peanut
buttertast1
tastes
like
a
big
tootsie
roll
i
splurged
and
bought
a
pretty
bottle
beer
and
i
was
craving
peanut
butter
chocolate
and
banana
gonna
keep
the
bottle
or
a
keepsake
now
that
i
type
over
the
mug
on
my
laptop
i
smmell
the
banana
would
not
buy
againsorry
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
but
definitely
didnt
deliver
on
the
flavors
promised
by
the
bright
pink
bottle
i
was
hoping
for
more
o
its
pretty
unpleasant
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
good
the
banana
flavor
is
like
a
sour
laffy
taffy
rolled
in
self
lighting

this

balance

robustness
of

to

a
fairly

i
should
have

on
you
fool

we
um
we
wont

i
personally
found
the
first
voodoo
doughnut
beer
beyond
disappointing
i
should
have
known
to
be
wary
im
aware
this
is
a
rather
harsh
review
but
when
a
company
puts
so
much
effort
into
marketing
a
beer
like
this
and
then
with
the
rather
exorbitant
price
tag
associated
with
it
the
consumer
is
in
a
position
to
be
brutally
honest
after
buying
the
ticket
and
taking
the
trip
lesson
learned
rogue
twice
bitten
with
this
series
i
hope
they
get
this
right
after
last
tragedy
and
it
pours
a
dark
dirty
brown
hue
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
that
slowly
resides
to
a
a
smog
of
cloud
across
the
top
and
a
rim
of
lacing
to
matchthe
smell
is
basically
an
even
mix
of
banannachocolatepeanut
butter
and
the
slightest
hint
of
bubblegumthe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
light
bodied
and
way
over
carbonated
making
the
mouthfeel
rather
rough
and
all
i
get
on
taste
is
an
artificial
blend
of
banannachocolate
and
peanut
butter
finished
off
with
a
herbal
green
cocoa
bean
bittersweetness
and
overall
you
guys
gave
proven
your
point
what
may
make
a
sensational
donought
does
not
necessarily
make
a
good
beer
please
quit
while
your
behind
and
u
waste
any
more
money
cheers
the
overall
was
like
eating
a
light
banana
with
no
other
ingredients
like
they
mentioned
this
beer
was
a
little
disappointing
it
was
very
pricey
an
d
did
not
measure
to
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
expected
a
journey
through
bananas
and
pb
doughnuts
it
was
weak
i
would
definitely
not
buy
it
again
i
was
a
one
time
gimmick
i
like
the
bottle
though
pours
a
dark
cola
like
brown
with
a
two
finger
khaki
color
head
the
head
gives
way
to
edging
and
fingers
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
peanut
butter
than
a
ripe
banana
smell
the
taste
follows
suit
up
front
is
deep
chocolate
taste
with
a
little
toasty
taste
there
is
a
slight
peanut
butter
flavor
before
banana
takes
over
at
the
end
the
mouth
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
creamy
overall
it
was
interesting
the
flavor
profile
swirls
around
from
sip
to
sip
it
is
worth
a
try
but
only
one
try
medium
body
lighter
effervescence
weirdly
i
think
i
would
prefer
this
beer
without
the
additions
of
chocolate
etc
poor
execution
on
this
one
maple
bacon
doughnut
was
great
had
hoped
this
would
be
close
rogue
screwed
up
again
o
a
fun
experiment
but
not
a
repeater
wish
the
peanut
butter
was
more
available
very
good
chocolate
taste
almost
like
drinking
a
banana
flavored
dark
chocolate
bar
the
aftertaste
ruined
it
for
me
it
has
a
very
metallic
taste
to
it
this
would
have
been
so
delicious
as
a
stout
i
dont
feel
as
if
i
wasted
my
money
on
this
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
maybe
halvesies
with
a
buddy
down
the
road
not
all
i
hoped
but
not
bad
worth
a
try
needed
at
least
2
abv
above
what
this
is
serving
type
bottle
the
smell
was
strong
like
a
typical
beer
but
you
also
sense
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
i
was
real
curious
about
the
chocolate
peanut
butter
and
banana
combination
which
you
cant
find
everyday
on
the
immediate
taste
you
can
sense
the
chocolate
and
banana
combination
which
settles
quite
well
with
the
lasting
flavor
of
peanut
butter
for
a
fruit
flavored
beer
i
wouldnt
rank
among
my
favorites
which
are
cherry
and
tangerine
so
far
in
this
category
i
would
recommend
trying
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
a
seasonal
special
with
est
159
calories
per

abv
edit
i
forgot
to
mention
the
tasty
chocolate
flavour
im
getting
very
reminiscent
of
their
chocolate
stout
a
saving
grace
o
in
theory
this
could
be
a
good
beer
if
pulled
off
correctly
this
however
is
more
of
a
banana
extract
mixed
with
chocolate
malt
and
a
touch
of
peanut
butter
beer
and
really
doesnt
work
id
like
to
see
the
peanut
butter
aspect
come
out
a
little
more
and
have
the
banana
taste
real
and
not
so
much
like
extract
i
enjoyed
the
other
voodoo
beer
this
one
not
so
much
overall
did
not
finish
the
bottle
very
disappointing
i
was
a
fan
of
the
first
voodoo
doughnut
collaboration
but
not
this
one
too
bitter
too
much
banana
not
enough
chocolate
or
pb
weird
beer
that
doesnt
taste
bad
but
fails
at
being
what
it
describes

d
this
beer
is
so
shitty
and
so
ungodly
expensive
that
i
can
only
assume
that
whoever
brewed
it
and
whoever
priced
it
are
going
to
be
sitting
in
it
someday
in
satans
bathhouse
it
should
be
obvious
that
i
would
never
buy
it
again
i
wouldnt
even
accept
a
free
bottle
hell
i
wouldnt
even
accept
a
free
bottle
if
it
came
with
a
good
local
sixer
if
it
meant
i
had
to
drink
this
again
the
only
redeeming
aspect
of
this
beer
is
that
it
scratched
my
curiosity
itch
albeit
at
great
cost
o
it
was
difficult
to
keep
perspective
on
this
one
it
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
and
extremely
sweet
but
in
some
ways
that
conflicting
flavours
and
the
almost
cloying
sweetness
were
intended
by
the
brewery
that
said
i
think
the
flavour
integration
could
have
been
much
better
o
overall
the
beer
was
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
there
are
better
chocolate
banana
and
peanut
butter
beers
out
there
that
taste
better
than
the
beer
individually
that
being
said
the
chocolate
flavor
in
the
beer
is
very
nice
its
just
not
quite
there
yet
if
you
are
a
chocolate
lover
i
think
you
could
enjoy
this
beer
if
you
arent
expecting
much
of
anything
else
overall
a
serious
misfire
from
a
brewery
that
i
can
usually
rely
on
for
rocksolid
beers
its
still
beer
ill
still
drink
it
and
enjoy
the
act
of
drinking
beer
but
it
doesnt
taste
very
nice
and
theres
a
great
deal
of
it
in
this
obnoxious
bottle
o
i
had
hoped
this
beer
would
be
better
than
the
maple
bacon
ale
i
was
wrong
it
started
out
good
until
the
second
drink
it
tastes
like
chocolate
dish
soap
how
can
two
beers
with
such
great
sounding
ingredients
be
so
bad
rogue
has
a
lot
better
beers
than
this
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
healthy
two
finger
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
massive
lacing
interesting
sweet
aroma
of
milk
chocolate
stone
fruit
juice
hints
of
peanut
butter
and
bananas
quite
estery
flavor
is
mild
chocolate
nuts
vanilla
hint
of
banana
finishes
drier
with
toasted
malt
and
light
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
like
the
last
voodoo
this
was
a
beer
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
really
wanted
a
paper
bag
to
make
sure
that
no
one
saw
me
buying
it
and
like
the
last
one
i
approached
with
trepidation
but
still
found
it
an
interesting
if
not
great
ale
this
tastes
like
a
decent
chocolate
ale
that
has
been
watered
down
and
blended
with
a
light
lager
you
can
almost
taste
decent
ingredients
crying
to
assert
themselves
kudos
to
rogue
for
trying
to
push
the
envelope
but
i
cant
help
but
think
that
this
could
have
been
better
with
a
more
substantial
dark
and
toasted
malt
body
to
support
the
sweet
flavors
i
had
a
good
time
drinking
this
because
rogue
pretty
much
shows
you
what
youre
going
to
get
with
the
label
and
the
flavors
were
fun
and
interesting
if
rather
thin
and
attenuated
still
definitely
a
one
and
done
will
i
be
tempted
by
the
next
version
of
the
pink
bottle
again
sadly
probably
yes
i
cannot
believe
they
are
charging
roughly
13
for
this
beer
and
i
cannot
believe
someone
in
that
company
thought
it
was
a
good
decision
to
release
it
at
that
price
point
for
the
price
alone
this
beer
is
atrocious
and
i
have
never
been
so
glad
to
not
have
paid
for
a
beer
in
all
my
life
i
have
one
bottle
left
and
i
am
giving
away
to
my
neighbor
i
think
so
many
people
were
let
down
by
the
bacon
maple
ale
that
they
decided
to
write
this
one
off
before
even
trying
it
if
you
go
into
a
beer
assuming
its
going
to
taste
like
shit
then
itll
probably
taste
like
shit
this
beer
wasnt
exactly
good
and
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
and
get
again
but
it
was
drinkable
and
it
was
different
and
it
was
about
six
thousand
times
better
than
the
bacon
maple
ale
overall
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
voodoo
doughnut
maple
bacon
ale
was
much
better
than
this
rogue
needs
to
tone
down
the
cocoa
and
increase
the
banana
and
peanut
butter
flavors
to
make
this
better
overall
the
beer
seems
deeply
divided
offering
on
the
one
hand
a
nice
set
of
sweet
dessert
notes
that
while
offering
few
traditional
beer
flavors
are
still
tasty
and
on
the
other
hand
a
bitter
citrusy
and
grassy
thread
that
wouldnt
be
out
of
place
in
a
light
ipa
the
problem
is
that
these
flavor
sets
would
be
decent
by
themselves
but
dont
work
together
and
the
beer
feels
like
it
needed
to
make
up
its
mind
whether
it
wanted
to
be
a
dessert
beer
or
a
lightlyhopped
pilsner
o
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
hard
to
review
because
it
is
both
so
strange
and
so
bad
that
words
cannot
do
it
justic
i
was
not
expecting
to
be
wowed
by
this
beer
but
i
at
least
expected
to
find
something
enjoyable
about
it
sadly
i
couldnt
find
a
single
redeeming
characteristic
it
looks
odd
smells
odd
tastes
odd
and
feels
oddin
other
words
its
an
odd
bird
ill
give
the
brewers
at
rogue
a
few
points
for
creativity
and
bravery
here
but
unfortunately
thats
all
i
can
do
if
awkward
could
be
fermented
and
bottled
it
would
be
this
beer
or
something
really
close
to
it
o
i
think
ill
continue
to
be
an
outlier
on
the
review
of
the
voodoo
doughnut
series
certainly
the
peanut
butter
was
a
tad
underwhelming
but
the
banana
sweetness
did
come
through
and
was
very
complementary
to
the
chocolate
notes
its
a
porter
with
a
unique
banana
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
nuttiness
i
suspect
if
they
werent
as
ambitious
in
the
description
of
the
beer
forcing
the
drinkers
to
expect
a
blast
of
banana
and
peanut
butter
the
reviews
would
be
a
lot
higher
nowhere
near
deserving
of
the
poor
reviews
and
if
given
the
opportunity
i
would
try
it
again
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
at
a
friends
house
and
while
i
know
the
person
who
brought
it
was
trolling
i
am
pretty
sure
rogue
is
trolling
beer
geeks
by
making
this
it
was
a
truly
awful
beer
dark
brown
almost
looked
like
a
stout
aroma
was
just
off
none
of
the
featured
ingredients
were
present
eww
flavor
was
quite
bad
hints
of
chocolate
but
mostly
just
yuck
i
would
never
drink
this
beer
again

would

of

overwhelming

additions
shine
overall
i
dont
understand
all
the
hate
for
the
voodoo
doughnut
series
both
have
been
accurate
to
their
names
and
a
new
beer
experience
worth
a
shot
as
long
as
the
price
isnt
outrageous
just
a
little
banana
but
mostly
overpowered
by
the
chocolate
taste
id
rather
drink
a
southern
tier
blackwater
series
than
this
not
a
very
good
beer
waste
of
9
if
you
ask
me
drinkability
this
is
better
than
i
expected
although
i
like
their
chocolate
stout
much
better
o
always
respect
to
rogue
for
pushing
boundaries
and
every
once
in
a
while
it
just
doesnt
come
together
the
chocolate
flavour
is
there
but
banana
and
pb
are
nowhere
to
be
found
complete
waste
of
money
with
real
ingredients
its
a
possibility
with
extracts
its
a
waste
of
water
its
hard
to
drink
it
tastes
like
crap
and
the
abv
is
so
low
you
feel
everything
sadly
ive
got
a
whole
bomber
to
finish
not
going
to
give
a
blow
by
blow
review
as
this
beer
does
not
deserve
one
it
says
quite
plainly
on
the
label
that
all
the
stated
flavors
come
from
extract
and
this
shows
very
clearly
in
the
taste
extremely
chalky
and
artificial
on
the
palate
while
it
might
still
be
bad
i
could
have
at
least
appreciated
a
beer
that
used
chocolate
malt
hefe
yeast
and
then
some
pb
in
secondary
fermentation
this
is
just
well
lazy
on
the
plus
side
i
now
have
a
pink
bottle
to
add
to
my
collection
glad
i
was
at
least
able
to
split
this
among
several
others
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
highlighted
brown
coloring
with
a
dense
frothy
light
tan
head
that
starts
around
an
inch
but
settles
in
to
a
thin
quarter
inch
layering
aromas
of
chocolate
syrup
both
rich
and
sugary
with
subtle
banana
notes
and
a
hint
of
peanut
butter
the
chocolate
really
takes
over
the
nose
banana
flavors
are
almost
candylike
with
a
weak
chocolate
syrup
character
and
only
hints
of
peanut
butter
here
and
there
very
awkward
on
the
palate
and
the
flavors
overpower
the
watery
thin
body
the
aftertaste
is
candysweet
once
again
and
the
cloying
sweetness
lingers
through
past
the
quick
watery
finish
this
beer
was
a
neat
idea
but
it
really
is
all
over
the
place
this
is
an
interesting
concept
but
itd
didnt
translate
well
the
banana
was
overpowering
and
seemed
artificial
the
peanut
butter
was
present
but
underwhelming
the
most
interesting
flavor
was
the
chocolate
which
tasted
like
an
odd
type
of
chocolate
ice
cream
overall
ill
give
it
points
for
uniqueness
but
this
was
not
pleasing
at
all
the
flavors
didnt
mesh
it
was
like
drinking
an
overripened
banana
split
with
weird
ice
cream
ill
pass
in
the
future
o
this
beer
seems
like
it
could
use
a
heavier
body
because
the
banana
and
chocolate
flavors
dont
seem
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
just
tastes
like
a
light
beer
with
some
syrup
flavorings
added
in
at
the
end
o
i
probably
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
and
i
did
not
hate
the
voodoo
maple
bacon
beer
because
the
smell
and
flavors
are
just
too
artificial
not
easy
to
drink
and
not
very
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
avoiding
it
overall
i
couldnt
recommend
it
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
wellexecuted
at
all
needed
to
be
darker
maltier
and
more
chocolaty
and
where
was
the
peanut
butter
overall
another
creative
entry
for
the
adventurous
palate
by
rogue
not
as
good
as
the
last
voodoo
brew
but
its
not
bad
i
find
the
flavours
are
off
balance
a
lot
of
chocolate
some
banana
and
a
hint
of
pb
worth
a
try
for
novelty
purposes
ill
say
i
liked
the
other
pink
version
better
but
overall
this
was
not
terrible
gimmicky
maybe
awful
no
obviously
i
knew
what
it
was
before
i
tried
it
and
as
a
beer
lover
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
not
many
others
are
attempting
this
probably
for
a
good
reason
but
i
do
applaud
the
effort
of
trying
something
out
of
the
norm
definitely
enjoyed
the
experience
and
the
thoughtprovoking
it
produced
i
had
a
peanut
butter
sandwich
for
lunch
today
so
im
recently
versed
in
that
particular
flavour
and
buster
heh
it
aint
here
however
the
banana
and
chocolate
do
well
enough
to
represent
but
the
overall
effect
is
too
busy
too
scattered
and
too
askew
to
take
as
anything
more
than
a
novelty
like
the
previous
voodoo
doughnut
incarnation
im
likely
above
average
in
my
rating
but
thats
mostly
because
i
dont
think
this
as
strange
as
it
is
warrants
rubbing
elbows
with
the
true
poor
beers
out
there
o
overall
a
strange
one
would
have
been
better
without
the
banana
but
i
know
thats
not
the
point
prob
love
it
or
hate
it
but
i
definitely
didnt
like
it
o
overall
a
decent
beer
interestingly
flavored
when
the
flavors
can
be
picked
out
i
would
stay
away
from
this
one
again
at
the
16bottle
price
point
too
expensive
for
a
notparticularlymemorable
beer
at
14
per
bottle
this
one
might
be
worth
a
pass
in
my
book
rouge
has
much
better
selection
available
yearround
mdo
overall
the
beer
is
not
bad
it
just
seems
a
little
chemically
which
detracts
from
the
beer
for
me
my
friends
both
enjoyed
it
i
was
a
little
disappointed
but
not
heartbroked
i
did
like
maple
bacon
better
excited
for
the
next
voodoo
overall
disappointed
the
flavours
were
so
synthetic
and
hidden
it
feels
like
im
tasting
a
cheap
brown
ale
with
a
strong
hoppy
bitterness
i
was
expecting
an
elvis
favourite
sandwich
beer
and
got
a
weak
watery
brew
instead
so
no
i
would
not
have
it
again
nor
recommend
it
i
just
hope
rogue
makes
better
novelty
beers
in
the
future
the
beer
pours
like
dark
chocolate
milk
or
dark
roast
coffee
the
beer
pours
with
a
massive
sandy
head
on
top
the
bubbles
are
creamy
on
the
surface
but
quite
rocky
beneath
leaving
a
sticky
thick
ring
of
lacing
and
lots
of
webs
running
down
from
that
the
beers
body
is
too
dark
to
penetrate
with
the
eye
on
the
nose
this
beer
smells
like
plastic
banana
chocolate
there
are
touches
of
chemical
green
apple
in
the
nose
as
well
really
this
beer
smells
fake
and
chemically
the
chocolate
does
lay
a
nice
layer
beneath
the
rest
of
the
smells
and
is
thick
and
rich
but
the
other
smells
are
really
quite
gross
on
the
tongue
this
beer
tastes
watery
with
definite
plastic
notes
sweet
and
bitter
the
flavor
begins
as
sweet
chemicals
moving
into
a
thick
chocolate
flavor
briefly
before
washing
into
a
watery
taste
that
mixes
bananas
and
chemical
flavors
in
a
slurry
a
slight
cocoa
chocolate
flavor
brushes
through
the
finish
but
is
not
very
long
lasting
for
part
of
this
taste
the
beer
is
pleasant
and
then
it
gets
really
gross
and
then
its
okay
and
then
its
gross
again
this
is
certainly
a
weird
beer
but
overall
i
think
its
gross
its
worth
a
try
but
you
should
split
this
thing
among
a
large
group
in
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
thin
to
medium
in
body
with
a
light
touch
of
dry
roast
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
lot
of
astringent
chemicals
on
the
sides
and
back
of
the
throat
overall
this
beer
is
weird
just
like
it
promised
to
be
i
really
am
not
a
fan
of
it
especially
the
chemical
flavors
that
i
get
from
it
but
there
are
some
strangely
redeeming
flavors
present
in
this
beer
and
they
make
me
keep
sipping
this
beer
tastes
horrible
but
it
isnt
a
drain
pour
o
i
dont
know
why
people
hate
these
beers
i
think
its
just
fun
to
hate
rogue
because
they
trick
people
into
buying
their
beers
by
making
new
names
for
them
that
and
their
yeast
is
a
little
sketchy
for
me
but
these
beers
are
fun
they
collaborate
with
a
famous
local
doughnut
shop
and
make
some
beers
that
i
would
never
have
thought
possible
yeah
it
may
not
be
a
everyday
drinker
or
maybe
even
a
repurchase
but
they
are
fun
beers
i
like
them
and
this
is
no
exception
onot
a
drainpour
but
definitely
not
a
re
buy
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
since
as
like
po
k
mon
you
gotta
have
em
all
ill
steer
far
clear
of
this
pink
bottle
of
sadness
and
regret
in
the
future

banana
peanut
butter
ale
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
that
was
withstanding
there
is
a
sweet
aroma
with
strong
peanut
butter
and
banana
the
taste
had
strong
peanut
butter
flavors
with
strong
hints
of
banana
with
just
hints
of
the
chocolates
drinkable
but
has
a
strange
linger
after
taste
the
peanut
butter
sticks
out
a
little
too
much
overall
a
strange
beer
very
very
unique
it
has
to
be
worth
a
try
just
for
being
weird
o
well
this
is
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
the
first
voodoo
ale
i
drain
poured
that
one
instantly
it
was
undrinkable
campfire
ashes
this
one
just
has
some
marginal
and
slightly
unpleasant
adjunct
flavors
in
it
it
generally
resembles
what
they
were
going
for
so
i
have
to
give
them
points
there
having
said
that
is
it
good
no
is
it
15
good
not
only
no
but
hell
no
it
would
be
worth
trying
as
an
experiment
for
about
a
dollar
at
this
price
point
only
loonies
will
buy
it
present
and
accounted
for
o
this
is
the
kind
of
shit
that
will
make
me
never
buy
another
rogue
beer
again
i
mean
cool
for
the
experimentation
but
who
in
the
f
at
qc
let
this
one
be
bottled
i
feel
completely
ripped
off
for
spending
13
on
this
bottle
of
waste
instant
drain
pour
48
a
bomber
of
voodoo
donut
chocolate
peanut
butter
and
banana
ale
served
in
a
pink
painted
bomber
from
rogue
pours
a
rich
carmel
brown
with
a
creamy
head
the
nose
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
as
all
i
was
able
to
detect
was
a
light
scent
of
cocoa
peanuts
and
roasted
grain
the
most
unfortunate
aspect
of
this
brew
was
the
taste
bitter
dry
with
the
acidic
sour
taste
that
you
find
in
burnt
coffee
this
beer
embodies
none
of
the
elements
that
you
find
in
a
tasty
brown
ale
i
appreciate
this
offering
as
a
bold
and
even
risky
gamble
but
there
needs
to
have
been
a
head
at
rogue
who
spoke
up
and
called
this
formula
for
what
it
was
and
continues
to
be
a
disappointment
o
better
than
the
maple
bacon
doughnut
version
but
not
an
outstanding
beer
id
say
its
pretty
average
i
applaud
them
for
daring
to
be
different
but
they
need
to
make
a
better
product
how
the
hell
could
i
resist
this
stuff
pours
a
brackish
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolatecovered
bananas
straight
up
good
times
the
taste
though
leads
with
a
strong
sense
of
rubbery
vinyl
tempered
only
by
a
wave
of
bitter
chocolateishness
wow
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
just
like
the
first
voodoo
doughnut
brew
things
smell
pretty
tasty
but
they
end
up
tasting
subpar
in
this
case
though
things
went
further
downhill
than
before
still
worth
the
shot
though
o
i
loved
the
first
voodoo
doughnut
brew
and
i
thought
the
concept
for
this
one
was
interesting
but
it
just
fell
flat
on
its
face
im
not
sure
if
they
used
an
extract
or
tried
to
add
something
artificial
for
the
banana
flavor
but
whatever
it
was
it
went
completely
haywire
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sugary
banana
with
faint
notes
of
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
dry
banana
and
underlying
flavors
of
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
in
the
end
a
small
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
banana
skin
and
small
peanut
butter
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
big
banana
all
the
way
through
notes
of
chocolate
and
peanut
butter
and
a
bit
bit
sticky
ill
take
a
maple
bacon
over
this
adventure
any
day
and
twice
on
sunday
time
to
move
on
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
little
head
an
little
retention
still
has
decent
lacing
peanut
butter
chocolate
are
evident
in
the
nose
but
im
not
picking
up
any
banana
follows
through
in
taste
goes
down
super
sooth
no
aftertaste
a
solid
stout
not
as
sweet
as
the
bacon
maple
edition
i
like
both
but
i
think
the
bacon
maple
version
is
superior
d
interesting
mix
of
flavors
not
quite
balanced
but
somewhat
enjoyable
c
like
others
have
said
this
was
a
major
disappointment
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
couldnt
get
down
a
glass
of
this
stuff
looks
amazing
and
had
my
hopes
up
immediately
the
smell
was
different
but
then
the
taste
was
awful
the
taste
was
very
artificial
and
for
13
a
bottle
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
i
guess
to
each
their
own
i
really
loved
this
beer
it
poured
nice
and
dark
like
a
stout
with
a
nice
latte
like
creamy
brown
head
the
taste
was
quite
different
but
very
good
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
when
i
make
myself
peanut
butter
banana
protein
shakes
with
chocolate
protein
powder
overall
id
drink
it
again
i
only
docked
half
a
point
off
the
overall
due
to
the
price
of
this
beer
15
bucks
for
one
bomber
just
seems
a
bit
steep
to
me
its
good
but
not
great
i
dont
feel
like
typing
a
full
on
review
but
it
was
pretty
chocolatey
slightly
bananay
and
basically
no
pb
at
all
it
was
pretty
average
much
better
than
maple
bacon
but
nothing
special
and
nothing
worth
15
but
still
pretty
good
i
expected
that
if
this
beer
were
to
miss
it
would
be
on
the
cloyingly
sweet
side
but
that
wasnt
it
this
beer
was
just
a
potpourri
of
mismatched
ingredients
in
my
opinion
and
the
13
price
tag
im
kicking
myself
i
drank
about
12
a
pint
before
pouring
the
rest
on
a
plus
note
the
empty
bottle
smelled
fantastic
the
next
day
on
a
good
note
i
loved
the
bottle
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
banana
and
a
slight
nutty
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
sounds
good
but
is
not
executed
very
well
with
a
flavor
that
is
very
mild
and
muted
not
heavy
on
the
blueberry
note
very
lite
in
color
smells
amazing
taste
is
decent
would
buy
again
if
in
a
pinch
gold
pour
with
quickly
disappearing
white
head
blueberry
pie
aromas
sweet
blueberry
taste
lite
mouthfeel
cloyingly
sweet
smell
is
outstanding
popped
one
open
left
the
room
came
back
the
whole
room
smelled
like
blueberry
muffins
taste
is
good
the
blueberries
are
out
front
and
delicious
its
not
the
greatest
crafted
brew
ive
had
and
the
taste
devolvesdiminishes
shortly
thereafter
but
its
stays
alright
not
a
great
fruit
beer
but
definitely
a
good
one
winter
haven
beer
crawl
ave
bar
gulp
gulp
gulp
ahhhhhhhh
daddy
likes
the
perfect
beer
for
the
perfect
day
by
the
pool
just
not
a
winter
beer
for
blueberry
beers
its
only
avg
which
is
still
very
very
very
good
let
me
just
say
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
this
one
and
when
it
is
the
time
and
you
find
yourself
in
the
place
this
really
can
be
pretty
awesome
beer
now
i
know
its
not
the
next
great
west
coast
ipa
or
barrel
fermented
sour
ale
not
even
close
but
we
have
to
step
back
and
appreciate
this
one
for
what
it
is
the
fruit
is
genuine
not
over
the
top
and
has
some
tartness
with
its
natural
sugars
the
wheat
base
beer
is
light
well
enough
crafted
if
a
big
generic
and
in
combination
with
high
carbonation
levels
a
clean
finish
for
the
style
and
a
real
low
abv
this
is
pretty
cool
beer
in
a
warm
weather
context
its
excellent
with
seafood
especially
of
the
fried
variety
and
is
honestly
a
pretty
underrated
beer
ive
heard
it
goes
off
pretty
quick
with
age
and
that
the
bottles
are
better
than
the
cans
but
my
first
and
only
impression
of
this
is
resoundingly
more
positive
than
the
other
reviewers
here
on
ba
honesty
better
than
not
bad
which
i
dont
think
its
scores
reflect
very
well
refreshing
and
worthy
of
taking
up
a
few
spaces
in
my
refrigerator
not
ashamed
to
say
so
it
was
okay
light
blueberry
taste
and
smell
not
too
bad
3

b
tastes
like
blueberry
nut
bread
good
stuff
pours
a
goldenamber
in
color
with
a
white
foamy
cap
that
doesnt
last
a
real
long
time
some
sheets
of
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
slides
back
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
is
like
a
fresh
blueberry
tart
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
blueberries
and
wheat
right
up
front
not
as
sweet
as
you
might
think
though
very
smooth
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
a
very
refreshing
brew
with
a
great
flavor
for
most
anytime
of
the
year
though
the
warmer
months
might
be
a
tad
better
i
liked
this
one
light
effervescent
fake
blueberry
taste
no
thanks
very
nice
and
refreshing
blueberry
beer
was
a
gift
and
it
really
my
style
that
and
the
fact
that
its
5
degrees
outside
is
making
it
rather
hard
to
enjoy
seems
like
it
would
most
likely
make
a
great
refreshing
treat
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
would
reconsider
this
fruity
delight
again
on
a
bit
day
its
rather
smooth
and
drinkable
a
bit
watery
to
earn
elite
status
an
enjoyable
enough
fruit
beer
the
blueberry
guest
allowed
to
run
rampant
in
many
of
its
forms
confectionery
to
start
all
the
way
to
a
decent
intersection
of
fruitiness
and
acid
by
the
finish
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
the
sun
of
a
seaside
summer
patio
a
travesty
of
blueberryflavored
beer
and
an
uncalled
for
fiasco
in
my
mouth
this
blueberry
wheat
ale
is
lacking
in
taste
when
compared
to
many
othersand
the
taste
that
is
present
is
kind
of
bad
found
this
beer
while
visiting
maine
best
blueberry
beer
i
have
had
not
too
hoppy
very
smooth
with
a
sweet
blueberry
flavor
its
a
nice
blueberry
beer
the
folks
at
sea
dog
say
delightful
aromatics
and
subtle
flavor
contributed
by
maine
wild
blueberries
i
found
the
blueberries
to
be
right
out
front
not
that
i
minded
that
one
iota
not
to
sweeten
but
to
balance
the
tang
of
the
wheat
great
for
a
hot
summers
day
hazy
color
no
head
when
brought
to
my
table
very
intense
blueberry
smell
bursts
off
the
top
tastes
about
as
sweet
as
it
smells
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
what
id
call
overwhelming
doesnt
have
that
syrupy
taste
of
some
other
fruit
brews
ive
had
i
have
to
say
the
blueberry
tastes
like
its
well
blended
in
the
malt
doesnt
taste
artificial
or
like
it
was
added
after
the
brewing
process
if
youre
looking
for
hops
though
look
elsewhere
i
personally
enjoy
this
one
im
a
bit
partial
to
blueberries
great
choice
of
a
dessert
beer
or
paired
with
fruit
decent
fruit
beer
extremely
easy
to
drink
subtle
as
the
blueberry
itself
it
sure
feels
real
o
while
i
appreciate
having
unique
varieties
of
beers
to
suit
different
palates
this
isnt
a
beer
for
me
i
used
to
love
this
beer
around
the
time
i
came
of
drinking
age
but
my
tastes
have
changed
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
certainly
not
difficult
to
throw
back
but
is
incredibly
one
note
id
love
to
see
variations
off
of
this
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
or
possibly
an
ipa
variation
anyway
this
kind
of
beer
is
polarizing
its
a
great
beer
for
some
and
a
terrible
beer
for
others
o
best
blueberry
nose
ive
ever
smelled
its
like
blueberry
muffins
in
a
beer
the
flavour
isnt
as
packed
with
blueberries
as
the
nose
suggests
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
brew
overall
i
was
upset
that
the
beer
flavor
did
not
live
up
to
the
name
or
smell
artificial
tasting
just
not
my
style
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
while
not
a
big
beer
it
isnt
bad
at
all
overall
a
rather
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
it
is
nothing
outstanding
but
in
terms
of
making
for
a
not
overly
sweet
but
moderately
blueberry
fruited
flavored
brew
this
one
has
it
right
not
too
bad
guilty
of
enjoying
this
one
every
once
in
a
while
nothing
stellar
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
some
find
the
blueberry
flavor
artificial
but
i
think
it
is
pleasant
and
worth
trying
once
or
twice
o
pretty
good
not
as
dry
as
their
raspberry
beer
but
i
think
thats
more
apt
for
the
blueberry
admixture
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
fruit
infused
wheat
beers
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
serve
with
a
summer
brunch
featuring
blueberry
pancakes
somewhat
disappointing
watered
down
and
thin
the
blueberry
flavor
comes
across
as
artificial
pro
tip
a
shot
of
berry
flavored
vodka
gives
it
a
really
nice
kick
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
uses
of
berry
flavored
vodka
in
the
taste
there
is
also
a
good
blueberry
note
but
then
i
get
something
else
akin
to
pale
and
wheat
malts
but
none
of
that
is
front
and
center
it
is
more
subdued
but
noticeable
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
not
bad
the
blueberry
aroma
strikes
you
at
first
gently
with
a
delicate
note
of
fresh
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
nice
blueberry
note
to
it
its
crisp
with
a
sweet
tinge
and
a
pleasing
carbonation
not
sure
where
the
wheat
comes
fromhefeas
its
more
of
a
flavored
blonde
ale
still
id
have
another
on
a
summer
day
was
quite
impressed
by
this
beer
took
me
by
surprise
tastes
like
a
liquid
blueberry
muffin
strong
blueberry
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
biscuitbread
flavor
at
the
end
definitely
will
buy
again
and
look
forward
to
trying
sea
dogs
other
fruit
beers
nice
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
good
intro
beer
for
people
not
into
craft
brew
i
cant
explain
it
with
this
beer
i
dont
usually
care
for
fruit
beers
in
general
but
there
is
just
something
about
this
beer
that
i
very
much
enjoy
its
all
about
the
blueberry
with
this
beer
its
very
much
the
dominating
flavor
if
given
the
chance
try
this
beer
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
the
beer
wasnt
as
sweet
or
overpowering
than
the
raspberry
offering
although
it
wasnt
much
to
look
at
or
feel
it
was
good
unlike
the
raspberry
which
tasted
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
anything
else
the
wild
blueberry
mixed
well
with
the
hops
and
malts
both
in
taste
and
in
the
smell
overall
its
good
refreshing
and
quite
crisp
a
good
summertime
brew
to
share
with
friends
and
family
okay
i
know
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
never
reviewed
or
rated
it
i
have
tried
it
again
today
i
will
say
that
the
beer
is
about
a
year
old
so
i
cant
really
remember
if
it
is
representative
of
what
it
should
taste
like
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
small
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
lacing
is
minimal
well
it
definitely
smells
like
blueberries
there
is
a
slightly
acidic
aroma
as
well
malty
taste
when
you
first
sip
followed
by
strong
acidic
taste
and
heavy
blueberries
there
is
not
much
else
but
blueberries
to
taste
not
really
my
style
if
i
remember
correctly
i
didnt
really
like
it
the
first
time
i
tried
it
either
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
better
blueberry
flavored
beers
that
ive
had
overall
a
great
summer
beer
that
tastes
almost
as
good
as
sam
adams
blackberry
witiber
great
blueberry
beer
that
is
not
overwhelming
with
blueberry
flavor
what
sea
dog
does
well
is
have
the
fruit
pop
out
towards
the
end
but
before
you
swallow
very
well
balanced
and
refreshing
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
hang
out
in
the
backyard
and
is
drinkable
enough
to
pound
down
a
few
and
not
get
tired
of
it
while
still
refreshing
i
hate
to
say
that
i
liked
the
apricot
better
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
bursting
with
blueberries
very
fruity
taste
is
tart
wheat
some
berries
but
not
overwhelming
with
them
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
jerry
remys
seaport
i
was
looking
to
try
something
new
and
somehow
didnt
realize
that
this
would
be
a
blueberry
beer
from
how
it
was
labeled
i
actually
like
fruit
beers
probably
more
than
most
on
this
site
but
generally
try
to
stay
away
from
blueberry
as
far
as
blueberry
beers
are
concerned
this
one
is
slightly
better
than
others
ive
had
for
instance
it
didnt
have
actual
blueberries
floating
around
in
it
when
it
was
served
to
me
anyway
the
color
is
pretty
enticing
with
a
deep
gold
and
a
short
soft
head
the
berry
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
for
my
liking
though
just
a
little
too
sweet
overall
when
it
comes
to
these
fruited
wheat
beers
it
seems
like
if
youve
had
one
youve
had
them
all
this
one
is
no
different
not
bad
but
not
at
all
memorable
either
i
really
like
this
beer
ill
be
picking
up
a
six
pack
here
and
there
to
enjoy
overall
so
far
as
fruit
beers
go
its
not
bad
but
people
who
arent
normally
fond
of
the
style
will
likely
find
the
blueberry
overwhelming
people
who
think
the
only
real
beer
is
belgian
german
or
as
thick
as
motor
oil
will
despise
it
but
if
youre
open
to
various
styles
its
worth
a
look
i
myself
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
it
because
it
reminds
me
of
a
recent
trip
to
ogunquit
maine
poured
this
blueberry
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
yellow
golden
color
produced
a
thin
white
head
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
and
blueberry
light
in
body
this
ale
had
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
white
pepper
and
blueberry
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
blueberry
beers
but
this
one
was
not
horrible
decent
session
beer
worth
a
try
oddly
enough
extremely
nice
combination
of
blueberry
and
beer
you
can
most
definitely
taste
a
strong
blueberry
flavor
but
it
doesnt
overpower
the
wheatiness
of
the
beer
the
smell
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
blueberry
poptart
very
happy
with
this
beer
o
i
immediately
feel
in
love
with
this
beer
at
world
of
beer
on
brady
street
in
milwaukee
served
with
a
few
small
blueberries
at
the
bottom
of
the
pint
i
find
the
tap
version
a
bit
more
elevated
than
this
bottle
but
its
quite
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
with
good
blueberry
taste
and
wheat
smoothness
nonetheless
o
i
used
to
like
this
beer
when
i
was
first
getting
into
craft
but
now
i
find
it
way
too
heavy
on
the
blueberry
to
the
point
that
it
just
tastes
like
blueberry
flavored
seltzer
water
obviously
one
thats
mainly
for
the
ladies
o
pass
on
this
one
nice
novelty
but
grows
old
very
quickly
overall
good
average
blueberry
beer
nothing
special
but
not
bad
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
with
white
foam
some
violet
tinting
malt
nose
that
evolves
into
a
fruity
berry
scent
fruity
flavor
first
and
foremost
very
balanced
though
with
a
mild
tart
berry
finish
creamyish
good
balance
between
fruit
and
beer
quite
fruit
forward
but
never
overbearing
o
refreshing
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
sessionable
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
for
cookouts
especially
when
i
was
living
in
nc
and
it
was
friggin
hot
in
the
summer
o
this
would
be
an
excellent
selection
for
someone
who
likes
fruity
wheat
beers
theres
nothing
overly
remarkable
about
the
taste
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
the
better
sea
dog
offerings
they
use
syrup
to
add
the
blueberry
flavor
but
it
doesnt
come
through
as
a
sticky
syrupy
mess
the
flavor
also
doesnt
come
across
as
artificial
if
you
enjoy
blueberries
then
you
should
give
this
a
try
overall
an
easy
drinker
simple
and
flavorful
but
redundant
a
treat
from
time
to
time
overall
not
that
bad
and
much
better
than
my
expectations
for
it
it
manages
to
pull
off
real
blueberry
character
rather
well
in
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
lot
else
in
its
makeup
its
not
great
but
it
does
a
solid
job
given
its
genesis
o
a
very
nice
blueberry
ale
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
fruity
ales
but
blueberries
are
an
exception
when
done
right
and
i
think
this
comes
close
blue
paw
wheat
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
goldenrod
theres
a
wispy
bit
of
white
foam
topping
the
beer
but
it
dissipates
quickly
no
sign
of
blueberry
in
the
appearance
the
nose
has
plenty
of
blueberry
aroma
with
a
light
bit
of
wheaty
grain
to
keep
things
interesting
the
flavor
profile
features
the
wheat
a
bit
more
and
the
blueberry
tastes
very
artificial
theres
plenty
of
it
there
but
it
noticeably
comes
across
as
being
a
bit
fake
id
be
shocked
if
all
the
blueberry
here
come
from
anything
besides
some
kind
of
extract
or
artificial
flavor
added
right
at
the
end
of
the
brewing
process
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
decent
with
just
a
little
bit
of
fullness
to
the
body
and
enough
carbonation
that
the
word
sparkling
comes
to
mind
while
drinking
it
theres
definitely
an
audience
for
blue
dog
wheat
ale
but
having
had
several
beers
brewed
with
real
fruit
and
made
one
of
my
own
something
like
this
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
sensory
glass
overall
a
great
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
people
on
the
mark
as
a
blueberry
beer
but
can
see
how
it
may
be
overpowering
for
some
overall
this
ones
worthy
of
a
try
especially
as
winter
gives
way
to
spring
its
light
and
its
very
tasty
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
certainly
a
flat
one
swing
and
a
miss
try
again
overall
impression
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
was
very
light
and
almost
pilsner
like
all
the
way
through
the
blueberry
aroma
was
nice
and
some
of
the
taste
but
absolute
downed
this
needed
more
body
carbonation
and
more
hops
and
other
ingredient
appreciated
but
there
are
many
other
fruit
beers
i
would
go
for
first
overall
i
got
this
since
i
tried
other
blueberry
beers
and
though
with
the
reviews
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
more
like
blueberry
syrup
in
a
typical
pale
ale
overall
not
bad
at
first
i
had
very
low
expectations
and
it
wasnt
too
bad
a
bit
thin
and
watery
too
syrupy
not
much
malt
or
wheat
flavor
but
blueberry
is
nice
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
and
not
so
pleasant
though
o
a
solid
blueberry
ale
for
the
style
its
light
abv
and
drinkability
suit
it
well
the
blueberry
could
be
improved
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
would
consider
purchasing
a
six
pack
when
the
occasion
calls
bodylight
fizzy
drinkable
smooth
lightly
dry
finish
good
stuff
would
get
it
again
not
overly
sweet
and
definitely
worth
the
price
o
its
a
little
hard
to
review
considering
the
fact
that
i
love
blueberries
and
im
not
offended
by
a
beer
that
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
in
the
end
i
think
i
could
have
them
sparingly
over
the
summer
but
not
any
more
or
during
any
other
season
i
couldnt
imagine
buying
this
for
myself
again
though
this
brew
was
one
of
the
first
fruit
beers
i
remember
having
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
at
first
but
i
felt
that
it
ended
up
being
a
good
experience
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
some
nice
blueberry
sweetness
on
the
nose
with
a
wheat
softness
in
there
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
blueberry
muffin
which
i
really
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
was
drinkable
and
soft
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
o
a
solid
blueberry
beer
that
does
a
nice
job
balancing
the
blueberry
and
malts
not
too
overpowering
yet
it
isnt
so
faint
that
you
can
barely
taste
the
blueberries
it
was
altogether
very
disapointing
and
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
had
much
higher
expectations
since
i
had
enjoyed
other
blueberry
beers
great
tasting
fruit
beer
quickly
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
but
really
light
on
the
blueberry
flavor
i
would
drink
it
again
though
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
small
spots
of
lacing
slide
back
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
is
basically
of
whole
wheat
blueberry
pancakes
a
very
breadybiscuitlike
blueberry
infused
combo
good
carbonation
level
makes
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
fruit
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
solid
b
average
i
have
had
this
one
in
the
bottle
and
there
is
basically
no
variation
from
the
smells
and
tastes
that
the
beer
has
on
tap
good
stuff
this
is
crisp
and
light
and
generally
not
a
bad
feel
but
it
gets
a
little
flat
and
bland
despite
consistent
carbonation
what
starts
as
smoothness
ends
a
little
slick
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
mix
things
up
its
bluberry
taste
is
balanced
i
wouldnt
grab
another
it
wasnt
bad
just
thin
and
plain
it
works
well
to
pair
with
hot
weather
i
may
pick
up
a
six
pack
to
go
down
the
shore
there
is
to
much
carbonation
and
the
blueberry
taste
was
kinda
artificial
but
i
must
say
i
really
enjoyed
the
mixture
of
the
wheat
and
blueberries
o
really
this
does
not
seem
like
too
much
of
a
beer
buuut
it
does
taste
good
it
feels
like
i
could
drink
a
hundred
of
these
all
in
all
this
one
delivers
hits
a
home
run
on
the
blueberry
note
while
stlll
allowing
the
wheat
notes
to
come
through
one
of
the
better
overly
fruit
flavored
brews
out
there
oits
definitely
not
a
terrible
beer
the
taste
of
blue
berries
will
stick
with
you
for
a
long
time
it
didnt
get
worse
as
i
drank
it
either
this
is
just
a
very
average
beer
go
maine
poured
a
clear
copper
with
no
head
apart
from
a
few
lonely
scattered
bubbles
obvious
blueberry
aroma
and
not
a
whole
lot
more
going
on
kind
of
reminded
me
of
some
kind
of
candy
i
had
as
a
kid
which
one
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
light
malty
taste
with
blueberry
and
more
blueberry
flavor
going
on
with
the
most
subtle
touch
of
orange
zest
a
little
bitter
from
some
floralseeming
hops
giving
a
dry
and
somewhat
bland
aftertaste
wheaty
but
not
too
harsh
or
acidic
which
is
good
light
body
and
pretty
easily
drinkable
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
fruity
for
some
but
if
you
order
a
blueberry
beer
its
presumable
that
you
dont
mind
fruit
beers
doverall
this
was
very
drinkable
and
even
though
i
likeblueberry
pop
tarts
i
really
dont
want
one
with
my
beer
so
overall
it
was
good
o
a
tasty
brew
i
would
buy
in
quantity
for
a
summer
event
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
3
5
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
scent
is
of
sweet
blueberries
and
wheat
but
definitely
more
of
the
blueberries
taste
brings
more
blueberries
outweighing
the
wheat
even
more
than
in
the
scent
its
lightly
carbonated
and
has
a
pretty
light
mouthfeel
overall
id
say
this
is
a
decent
fruit
beer
and
one
that
ill
buy
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
this
style
o
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
think
it
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
but
tastes
natural
and
not
some
additive
not
bad
all
together
it
pours
a
light
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
dull
white
head
its
very
light
in
body
it
smells
of
fresh
blueberry
muffins
as
in
when
you
pull
the
muffins
out
of
the
oven
and
then
open
one
up
while
its
still
warm
its
pretty
strong
but
i
dig
it
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
something
its
not
baked
goods
its
not
real
blueberries
it
might
be
a
blueberry
candy
it
could
also
be
the
berry
flavor
from
captain
crunch
its
tasty
regardless
the
beer
is
crazy
thin
even
for
a
wheat
its
drinkable
though
because
its
very
tasty
and
flavorful
i
could
probably
drink
a
bunch
of
this
its
very
sessionable
i
like
it
enough
o
not
terrible
was
worried
by
the
nose
but
taste
was
fine
i
am
not
a
huge
blueberry
fan
a
friend
bought
this
so
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
but
was
worth
drinking
so
i
am
in
new
hampshire
for
the
great
bay
half
marathon
its
the
night
before
a
race
and
why
not
drink
some
ok
alot
of
the
local
beer
staying
at
teh
local
holiday
inn
and
they
have
sea
dog
blue
paw
on
tap
this
beer
has
was
a
pale
hazy
yellow
in
color
with
thin
white
head
and
great
lace
the
smell
was
overpowering
i
smelled
it
as
soon
as
it
was
placed
on
the
table
just
like
blueberry
pie
the
beer
has
blueberry
out
the
ass
taste
the
smell
funnels
into
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
light
abv
leads
to
this
beer
being
a
session
certainly
worth
a
taste
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
might
buy
it
again
ive
had
better
but
ive
definitely
had
worse
deserves
a
try
pours
a
very
clear
very
lite
goldenyellow
head
recedes
to
nothingness
right
away
smell
is
thick
with
blueberries
also
a
bit
of
a
paint
thinneralcohol
aroma
taste
is
mostly
the
fruit
the
beer
is
named
by
tart
and
sweet
decent
wheaty
goodness
as
well
a
little
sourness
after
the
sip
but
nothing
distracting
at
all
feel
is
carbonated
i
might
drink
another
drinkability
while
its
certainly
better
than
the
apricot
or
raspberry
i
have
problems
finishing
this
bottle
for
me
the
blueberry
tastes
too
artificial
and
too
powerful
for
the
whole
drink
i
can
see
it
being
drinkable
but
i
think
the
sweetness
from
the
blueberry
might
be
too
much
for
some
people
smells
great
smells
of
blueberries
and
light
wheat
tastes
just
as
it
smells
one
of
the
few
beers
that
do
that
mouthfeel
is
decent
for
such
little
head
i
could
drink
this
everyday
all
day
poured
a
sparkling
clear
light
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
was
fully
diminishing
and
had
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
of
blueberrys
and
had
a
mild
sweet
yeast
and
a
light
bread
malt
scent
it
tasted
sweet
with
an
abundance
of
blueberrys
at
first
and
finished
lightly
sweet
of
blueberrys
and
not
much
else
with
the
flavor
only
lasting
a
very
short
time
mouthfeel
was
extremely
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
and
had
a
lively
carbonation
overall
nothing
more
than
a
blueberry
soft
drink
and
not
a
good
one
at
that
served
ontap
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
coppergold
color
with
a
thin
bead
of
white
foamy
head
there
is
a
heavy
sweet
blueberry
nose
with
toasted
cereal
characteristics
the
blueberry
smells
are
real
fruit
too
not
syrupy
the
beer
is
semisweet
with
blueberry
and
slight
citrus
flavors
highlighting
a
toasted
oat
flavor
in
the
forefront
the
body
also
has
some
wheat
characteristics
the
body
is
very
light
and
creamy
smooth

crisp
the
aftertaste

sweet

tart
blueberry
with
some
cerealoats
characteristics
also
the
finish
follows
suit
with
the
fruity
theme
but
the
general
sweetness
lingers
a
little
bit
longer
eventually
giving
a
clean
break
on
the
palate
the
sweetness
makes
this
a
lownumber
consumption
beer
but
great
on
a
hot
day
as
i
like
beer
with
deeper
tastes
i
would
definitely
have
more
easy
to
drink
maybe
too
easy
with
a
nice
carbonated
mouthfeel
what
i
love
most
about
seadog
blueberry
is
that
it
is
a
great
mixer
black
n
blue
guiness
n
seadog
the
brew
pubs
that
they
are
putting
all
over
new
england
are
only
going
to
help
the
brand
d
light
crisp
well
balanced
flavor
at

make
this
a
very
good
summer
session
wheat
ale
i
dont
know
that
id
want
more
than
one
of
these
but
thats
fairly
normal
with
a
fruit
beer
smell
is
a
faint
fruit
blueberry
but
some
bread
smell
surprisingly
as
well
nothing
offensive
taste
comes
through
with
a
smooth
watery
chewy
grain
on
the
finish
making
a
nice
beer
like
balance
with
the
fruit
this
isnt
an
overpowering
fruit
bomb
which
is
why
i
seem
to
enjoy
it
quite
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
and
could
have
another
its
a
straightforward
easy
one
and
doesnt
taste
of
fake
fruit
a
pale
goldenamber
ale
with
a
nice
head
but
minimal
lacing
sea
dog
opens
with
a
delicious
bouquet
of
fresh
blueberries
im
a
big
fan
of
blueberry
so
im
hoping
the
taste
stays
faithful
its
a
mild
light
flavor
with
a
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
blueberry
taste
im
glad
this
one
tastes
natural
without
the
weird
syruppy
artificial
aftertaste
of
some
blueberry
beers
ive
had
a
delightful
drink
reviewed
on
1332010
di
let
it
get
warm
because
it
was
not
the
best
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
small
head
no
real
lacing
and
head
dies
down
fairly
quickly
smells
of
incredibly
sweet
blueberry
almost
like
a
blueberry
candy
with
the
faintest
hint
of
wheat
carbonation
level
is
pretty
good
i
can
see
this
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
it
is
much
too
sweet
to
have
as
a
regular
beer
dmif
you
like
blueberries
this
is
definitely
the
beer
for
you
crazy
how
fruity
this
beer
is
but
very
good
tasting
pours
surprisingly
clearcertainly
a
good
hint
that
this
isnt
going
to
be
he
really
tasty
type
of
blueberry
beer
light
head
the
smell
isnt
too
artificial
bringing
forward
some
straight
blueberry
notes
without
much
else
the
taste
might
add
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
although
blueberry
is
about
it
this
doesnt
taste
too
artificial
and
is
actually
fairly
refreshing
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
the
first
thing
i
noticed
as
that
it
didnt
look
like
a
typical
wheat
beer
extraordinarily
clear
in
the
glass
with
little
to
no
head
its
all
blueberries
on
the
nose
but
it
drinks
like
biting
into
a
moist
blueberry
muffin
one
of
those
superbly
moist
well
preserved
massproduced
muffins
that
you
cant
get
enough
of
i
was
very
happy
to
find
that
it
didnt
have
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
or
a
stickysweet
finish
like
some
other
fruity
wheat
beers
if
you
like
blueberries
youll
love
this
beer
pretty
good
for
the
style
d
i
like
this
one
is
just
creamy
nice
a
bit
watery
so
i
could
pound
this
one
and
enjoy
the
fruity
flavors
in
a
beer
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
light
wheat
beer
with
the
subtle
extra
taste
of
blueberry
fruit
yum
d
definetly
drinkable
im
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
but
nevertheless
a
good
beer
to
have
every
now
and
then
i
wonder
how
much
this
goes
for
anywhere
other
than
the
cape
because
im
sure
those
prices
are
jacked
up
quite
a
bit
notes
best
before
nov
10
not
too
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
with
realistic
blueberry
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
wheat
flavor
and
bready
taste
reminds
me
a
bit
of
blueberry
muffins
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
if
you
want
a
blueberry
taste
have
revisited
this
several
times
and
having
for
some
reason
been
on
a
fruit
beer
kick
of
late
more
and
more
i
think
they
nailed
this
one
the
pale
biscuity
malts
showcase
the
blueberry
well
and
its
as
much
like
blueberry
pie
as
i
suppose
a
beer
could
be
without
being
cloying
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
couldnt
stop
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
it
i
was
out
of
beer
strange
thing
is
though
it
drinks
a
bit
like
if
it
was
a
notch
or
two
above
a
bud
light
with
blueberry
just
a
little
less
watery
it
goes
down
great
and
was
a
perfect
breakfast
beer
with
the
chicken
and
waffles
im
not
saying
its
not
enjoyable
on
its
own
or
that
it
should
be
had
only
with
greasy
food
best
for
me
that
way
its
tasty
and
for
what
it
is
has
mass
appeal
appearance
of
this
beer
had
typical
ale
qualities
such
as
dark
amber
color
and
medium
brownish
head
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
however
make
it
a
winner
the
blueberry
presence
wasnt
overpowering
in
those
categories
i
felt
there
was
a
right
amount
of
them
put
into
this
beer
it
was
a
very
sweet
aroma
and
taste
usually
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
or
recommend
drinking
them
on
a
regular
basis
while
i
stand
by
my
belief
on
the
latter
i
can
make
an
exception
on
the
former
in
regards
to
this
particular
brew
its
good
enough
to
be
considered
worthy
andor
given
a
try
decent
overall
not
too
sweet
like
some
fruit
beers
can
be
the
flavor
isnt
what
i
had
expected
or
hoped
blueberry
tastes
artificial
and
weak
its
there
but
its
a
little
sour
and
faketasting
some
light
honey
tones
noted
as
well
bitterness
is
low
comparing
this
to
sweetwaters
version
this
gets
blown
out
of
the
water
and
that
beer
isnt
spectacular
or
anything
its
interesting
but
nothing
i
would
run
out
to
get
back
to
the
this
batch
comment
all
of
these
fruit
beers
that
are
mass
produced
come
with
a
considerable
inconsistency
factor
usually
this
is
the
best
blueberry
ale
that
i
have
had
in
recent
years
atlantic
brewing
used
to
have
the
best
blueberry
ale
when
it
was
actually
brewed
in
bar
harbour
maine
but
now
that
it
has
reappeared
in
recent
years
i
believe
it
has
lost
its
quality
through
the
contract
brewing
process
sea
dog
still
gets
my
vote
for
best
blueberry
available
today
especially
since
they
brew
it
in
maine
and
get
those
blueberries
fresh
drinkable
if
offered
to
me
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
d
my
girlfriend
bought
a
6er
of
this
so
i
decide
to
try
one
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruity
beers
ive
had
and
if
you
like
blueberries
youll
probably
love
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
worth
a
shot
d
somewhat
of
interesting
novelty
type
beer
but
im
not
sure
id
want
more
than
a
glass
of
one
i
could
smell
this
beer
and
be
happy
but
drinking
more
than
one
is
not
going
to
happen
there
are
better
fruit
beers
out
there
i
had
this
on
tap
in
celebration
fl
i
actually
found
it
to
be
a
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
my
first
glass
and
it
was
gone
before
i
even
knew
it
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
it
was
a
little
to
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
the
smeel
and
drinkability
were
way
up
there
and
i
got
a
2nd
glass
pours
a
light
clear
yellow
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
blueberries
very
sweet
smell
but
not
too
sweet
or
over
powering
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
a
grain
backbone
and
it
is
blueberries
all
over
other
than
that
hint
a
little
artificial
in
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
light
in
texture
overall
its
an
above
average
drinkable
beer
it
is
nice
and
smooth
but
the
artificial
blueberry
keeps
it
from
being
great
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
have
if
someone
brought
it
over
nothing
i
would
go
out
and
buy
myself
unless
im
drinking
with
people
who
are
not
into
craft
beer
it
has
a
high
drinkability
but
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
i
love
this
beer
its
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
since
it
is
so
flavorful
but
i
enjoy
every
drop
when
i
order
it
it
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
a
wheat
ale
with
a
blueberry
flavor
so
many
flavored
beers
are
not
flavored
enough
or
are
over
flavored
this
has
the
perfect
blend
drinkability
snoozers
blue
paw
is
a
truly
lackluster
base
beer
dosed
with
blueberry
flavoring
from
time
to
time
i
do
enjoy
a
quality
wheat
ale
or
fruit
beer
sadly
this
one
is
neither
d
one
of
the
most
palatable
widelyavailable
fruit
beers
imo
in
the
same
vein
as
shipyard
pumpkinhead
or
magic
hat
9
way
better
ontap
blueberry
thats
what
this
beer
is
the
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
blueberry
with
some
malt
it
starts
sweet
and
becomes
a
blueberry
flavor
there
is
no
bitterness
and
finishes
slightly
dry
this
is
very
drinkable
if
you
like
blueberry
and
dont
like
beer
taste
youll
like
this
d
something
fun
and
different
to
bring
to
a
bbq
it
is
refreshing
and
quenching
there
is
an
ok
beer
underneath
the
berries
and
it
avoids
the
cloying
syrupiness
with
which
some
fruit
beers
offend
just
a
touch
fizzy
which
is
alright
for
a
summer
wheat
beer
but
it
would
be
nice
to
get
some
more
wheat
twang
thin
head
even
with
an
aggressive
finish
to
the
pour
leaves
tiny
islands
across
the
surface
and
virtually
no
lacing
golden
straw
color
of
moderate
depth
however
remains
mostly
transparent
plenty
of
active
bubbles
visible
without
a
doubt
the
blueberry
scents
the
major
player
in
the
nose
the
wheat
and
grains
obvious
as
well
smidge
of
lemon
citrus
as
well
as
malted
milk
balls
difficult
to
find
a
great
deal
of
breadth
when
you
can
smell
the
blueberries
three
feet
away
from
the
glass
light
to
mediumbodied
crisp
and
heavily
carbonated
not
very
sweet
even
taking
into
account
the
bodacious
blueberry
presence
the
wheat
and
general
hoppiness
not
out
to
zing
you
relatively
soft
contours
to
it
the
citrus
offers
mute
lemon
and
orange
flavors
sip
after
sip
theres
just
not
much
more
to
say
it
is
labeled
as
a
blueberry
wheat
beer
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
tastes
like
the
appearance
i
a
light
golden
color
didnt
have
a
lot
of
head
but
a
nice
thin
lace
around
edge
of
glass
a
very
inviting
aroma
of
fresh
picked
blueberries
great
light
refreshing
taste
of
wheat
and
blueberries
that
are
inviting
have
a
great
mouth
feel
with
a
little
carbonation
to
it
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
solid
beer
in
the
fruity
beers
category
i
think
the
bad
smell
was
a
single
beer
thing
not
a
whole
production
thing
despite
the
offstench
in
the
nose
i
liked
every
other
part
of
this
beer
d
very
sweet
beer
lots
of
sugar
and
blueberry
for
me
it
is
a
one
and
done
it
was
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
enjoy
d
ill
admit
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
different
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
brew
wasnt
overly
sweet
i
wouldnt
reach
for
a
beer
like
blue
paw
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
definitely
enjoyable
when
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
light
golden
colour
with
little
to
no
head
smells
of
sweet
blueberries
but
somewhat
artificial
tastes
like
a
liquid
blueberry
pie
almost
too
sweet
and
very
carbonated
but
still
a
wonderful
taste
feels
a
slight
bit
light
and
watery
but
not
too
bad
at
all
goes
down
very
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
berry
aftertaste
very
smooth
with
the
taste
of
the
blueberries
lingering
on
your
tongue
crisp
and
refreshing
any
time
of
the
year
drinkability
is
decent
if
you
like
berries
and
not
much
else
might
be
too
sweet
for
more
than
one
for
me
though
worth
the
taste
but
i
was
quite
underwhelmed
i
like
blueberries
i
like
beer
but
for
some
reason
i
just
cant
drink
too
much
of
this
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
but
not
bad
dont
get
me
wrong
ill
drink
it
again
especially
with
some
fresh
blueberries
overall
a
pretty
good
blueberry
beer
maybe
not
the
greatest
i
have
tasted
but
certainly
not
the
worst
d
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
here
not
sure
i
could
put
back
a
lot
of
any
type
of
fruit
beer
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
blueberry
ales
ive
had
neko
d
sessionable
moderate
to
through
the
roof
depending
on
your
love
for
blueberry
beer
for
the
same
id
rather
go
grab
newport
storms
rhode
island
blueberry
by
far
my
favorite
blueberry
beer
still
if
its
a
hot
day
and
you
want
to
cool
off
and
take
a
breather
this
beer
fits
the
bill
amply
d
light
body
and
high
carbonation
makes
this
a
good
drinker
the
taste
holds
it
back
a
little
however
if
you
like
wheat
beers
more
than
i
do
then
you
might
enjoy
this
i
would
prefer
a
little
less
carbonation
and
a
bit
more
synthesis
of
flavor
if
ever
there
was
a
beer
to
drink
with
a
fruit
pie
this
might
be
it
highly
drinkable
dsmooth
clean
and
delicious
and
easy
to
have
multiple
pints
or
bottles
it
is
highly
refreshing
in
your
mouth
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
liked
it
very
much
and
i
am
going
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
case
of
it
at
my
beer
distributer
for
some
pleasant
summer
drinking
a
basic
blonde
ale
with
ample
fruitiness
and
an
added
blueberry
punch
though
the
fruits
do
as
promised
the
base
beer
falls
short
d
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
exactly
what
a
fruit
beer
should
be
12oz
brown
bottle
obtained
at
mckinnons
in
salem
nh
pours
a
translucent
golden
body
with
about
a
half
inch
of
shortlived
offwhite
head
smells
strongly
like
blueberry
sweetness
almost
syrupy
tastes
fruity
blueberry
but
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
it
to
be
husky
grainwheat
flavor
shares
an
equal
portion
of
the
flavor
a
dry
blueberry
quality
dominates
the
aftertaste
moderate
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
very
drinkable
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
but
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
d
i
suppose
if
you
are
into
sweet
beers
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
there
is
definately
a
moderation
exercised
here
but
after
a
few
i
personally
have
had
all
the
fruit
in
my
brew
that
i
can
handle
overall
a
decent
brew
would
have
again
if
i
was
just
going
to
have
1
or
2
to
top
the
night
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
big
fizzy
white
head
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
the
aroma
of
blueberry
muffin
hits
you
has
a
strong
stale
blueberry
aroma
hints
of
alcohol
and
feet
flavor
is
of
harsh
blueberry
no
real
depth
here
weak
finish
high
carbination
has
okay
wheat
tones
but
not
great
this
one
misses
for
me
but
its
not
awful
very
refreshing
however
very
sweet
and
candylike
maybe
okay
for
a
blueberrylover
but
perhaps
not
for
me
i
probably
should
have
tried
this
beer
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
when
temperatures
were
in
the
eighties
as
opposed
to
the
forties
that
said
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
in
warmer
temperatures
but
its
not
something
ill
keep
on
hand
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
again
not
very
beerlike
but
it
tastes
good
drinkability
this
to
me
is
the
standard
bearer
of
blueberry
beer
if
i
have
a
fruit
beer
i
want
to
be
able
to
taste
the
fruit
it
represents
for
the
style
i
believe
this
is
the
best
at
what
it
does
while
it
is
sweet
i
can
drink
this
year
round
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
a
session
beer
i
like
it
and
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
had
for
as
much
as
i
like
it
in
a
bottle
as
i
had
it
for
this
review
i
love
it
on
tap
more
overall
while
not
cloyingly
sweet
a
little
too
sweet
and
tart
to
be
a
session
beer
but
a
good
desert
beer
drinkability
goes
down
easily
i
would
suggest
this
beer
as
a
summertime
cooler
easy
drinking
and
very
simple
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
fruity
sugary
sweet
for
my
taste
but
i
could
see
how
these
could
disappear
very
quickly
they
are
extremely
light
and
refreshing
tap
the
bell
in
hand
smells
and
tastes
like
blueberry
cake
with
powdered
sugar
pours
gold
with
a
little
white
head
the
wheat
back
does
come
through
on
this
beer
which
is
nice
but
the
blueberries
make
it
just
too
sweet
at
the
same
time
it
is
nice
to
have
a
fruit
beer
that
has
real
beer
flavor
in
it
also
try
a
black
and
blueblueberry
layered
with
stout
easy
to
quaff
and
has
a
great
aroma
you
will
burping
blueberry
for
a
couple
hours
after
this
one
very
drinkable
and
the
blueberry
taste
is
not
overwhelming
mine
appears
to
be
out
of
date
but
no
illeffects
were
noticed
upon
consumption
i
was
happy
with
this
selection
because
it
was
rather
light
would
be
good
for
a
summer
drink
not
too
heavy
and
certainly
not
an
amber
much
more
pilsnerlike
in
appearance
im
not
a
big
fan
of
blueberries
although
i
do
like
fruit
beers
and
this
one
certainly
made
the
cut
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
variety
and
i
think
this
is
much
better
than
the
ab
concoction
12
fl
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
gbbf
2008
for
takeaway
abv
is
not
stated
on
the
bottle
but
the
festival
programme
says
its
4
8
crystal
clear
deep
golden
to
amber
colour
moderate
head
fizzy
distinct
aroma
of
blueberries
and
raspberries
also
notes
of
candy
with
said
artifical
flavourings
thin
mouthfeel
the
flavour
is
wheaty
with
notes
of
blueberries
otherwise
fairly
bland
with
minimal
hops
not
very
sweet
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
drinkability
as
harsh
as
it
sounded
like
i
rated
it
i
liked
it
the
best
ive
had
from
sea
dog
which
isnt
saying
much
when
you
look
at
their
other
offerings
but
this
one
i
would
come
back
to
this
is
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
it
may
be
a
tad
overkill
with
the
blueberry
taste
and
aroma
but
i
thought
it
was
tasty
and
drinkable
is
this
a
beer
enough
said
this
is
my
first
shot
at
a
review
after
lurking
for
some
time
on
ba
and
drinking
a
wide
selection
of
beers
for
years
i
hope
i
start
reviewing
more
this
beer
was
easy
enough
to
drink
though
i
doubt
i
would
have
more
than
a
couple
at
a
session
but
i
am
not
a
gigantic
fan
of
flavored
beers
so
i
am
biased
it
was
nice
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
night
and
i
would
imagine
the
addition
of
fresh
blueberries
would
add
another
level
of
enjoyment
overall
a
good
blueberry
beer
as
blueberry
beers
go
good
lawnmower
or
beach
stuff
a
sentimental
favorite
from
a
maine
camping
tripexcursion
a
ways
back
didnt
disappoint
for
the
style
my
description
is
weird
i
know
but
just
try
it
for
yourself
and
maybe
youll
see
what
im
saying
or
just
think
im
an
idiot
d
definitely
drinkable
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
definitely
recommended
d
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
session
ale
the
blueberry
is
an
acquired
taste
though
so
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
the
feel
is
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
with
a
sharpness
to
the
bubbles
that
is
a
little
offputting
plus
it
increases
the
feeling
of
fullness
otherwise
this
is
a
fine
enough
drinking
beer
suitable
for
the
warm
weather
pending
not
good
its
a
beer
but
it
tastes
unbalanced
and
feels
watery
i
might
want
an
mgd
before
i
have
this
one
again
blueberry
flavor
is
so
sticky
that
it
isnt
even
that
refreshing
d
very
drinkable
its
tough
to
stop
at
just
one
an
excellent
fruit
beer
simply
because
the
fruit
is
not
poorly
represented
which
seems
to
happen
more
times
than
not
it
has
a
very
true
flavor
spot
on
ripe
wild
blueberry
if
that
is
what
you
want
this
beer
will
give
it
to
you
have
had
this
in
both
bottle
and
draft
form
and
the
draft
seems
to
be
a
little
crisper
and
straightforward
i
guess
that
is
a
bad
thing
if
you
like
a
more
wholesome
mouthfeel
w
a
creamier
edge
a
seethru
brew
of
a
dark
gold
color
this
beer
has
a
very
good
blueberry
smell
to
it
not
faint
at
all
i
liken
the
taste
to
a
blueberry
pancake
not
much
else
to
it
goes
down
real
smooth
and
these
are
nice
to
have
once
in
a
while
this
beer
is
a
little
different
from
the
norm
i
was
expecting
something
like
the
sweetwater
blue
but
this
tastes
more
like
a
blueberry
muffin
it
pours
up
light
and
is
def
different
to
the
pallet
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
not
something
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
this
however
is
my
girlfriends
favorite
beer
and
would
prob
be
good
to
consider
a
chick
beer
nice
rich
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
white
head
smell
is
almost
exclusively
blueberries
and
a
light
metallic
smell
as
well
crisp
taste
but
watery
and
very
lightly
flavored
noticeable
blueberry
taste
but
also
a
bit
cardboardybland
perhaps
it
wasnt
the
freshest
not
good
but
drinkable
let
it
warm
a
bit
in
these
cold
winter
months
and
serve
it
icy
in
the
summer
i
generally
dont
like
fruitveggie
beers
but
this
one
from
sea
dog
is
a
nice
relaxed
offering
of
the
style
a
sweet
flavor
that
is
contrasted
nicely
with
a
pleasant
nuttiness
the
finish
is
vaguely
reminiscent
of
breakfast
cereal
overall
not
the
best
blueberry
ale
ive
had
but
far
far
from
the
worst
either
worth
a
go
had
this
one
at
the
pub
in
amherst
it
poured
out
with
a
light
murky
gold
appearance
pretty
thin
head
i
smelled
the
great
fragrances
of
crisp
strong
blueberries
that
definitely
increased
anticipation
finally
when
i
sipped
the
drink
i
was
amazed
sharp
sharp
blueberry
that
was
very
excellent
a
pretty
good
carbonation
helped
make
it
light
and
refreshing
overall
an
excellent
ale
this
is
a
fairly
light
ale
but
still
has
good
amount
of
flavor
also
the
blueberry
flavor
is
not
too
strong
which
sometimes
can
be
a
problem
d
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
with
ease
it
is
a
bit
sicky
sweet
if
you
have
too
many
but
fortunately
or
unfortunately
the
alcohol
content
is
low
4
6
and
you
wont
get
wrecked
in
the
process
pours
a
clear
amber
that
seems
to
have
just
a
little
touch
of
pinkish
to
it
from
the
blueberry
i
am
guessing
nose
is
like
a
basket
of
blueberries
and
not
much
else
really
able
to
immediately
overpower
that
flavor
is
like
dirty
blueberries
in
the
midst
of
an
ale
hardly
clean
at
all
bitter
and
almost
a
slight
metallic
edge
to
it
no
strong
wheat
characteristics
to
it
at
all
feel
is
like
standard
beer
with
just
a
little
more
bubble
perhaps
i
cant
say
it
is
overly
drinkable
due
to
its
lack
of
grace
or
any
smooth
qualities
whatsoever
i
love
blueberries
but
this
is
not
something
i
really
enjoyed
or
would
go
hunt
out
again
for
me
as
a
blueberry
lover
its
hardly
worth
going
back
to
or
even
trying
in
the
first
place
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
im
looking
for
something
sweet
and
that
has
no
subtly
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
but
recedes
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
blueberries
with
a
wheaty
twang
but
is
rather
faint
the
taste
has
a
little
more
blueberry
than
the
aroma
but
is
still
quite
bland
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
like
all
too
many
other
fruity
american
wheat
beers
it
is
boring
and
mundane
i
will
not
drink
this
again
overall
id
buy
it
again
i
see
this
as
a
beer
to
break
people
out
of
some
of
their
preconceptions
of
what
sort
of
flavors
can
be
in
a
beer
or
also
for
women
or
people
who
just
love
a
blueberry
flavor
ill
definately
be
buying
again
given
the
right
circumstances
d
i
could
put
a
few
back
good
lawnmower
beer
after
its
release
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
the
beer
show
a
slightly
cloudy
gold
with
a
modest
white
creamy
head
that
fades
away
leaving
the
lace
a
fine
covering
sheet
on
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
fruity
aroma
backed
by
the
malt
start
has
a
light
grain
profile
sweet
and
appetizing
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
fair
to
middling
acidity
the
hops
light
in
their
spiciness
sweet
and
dry
drinkable
a
good
picnic
beer
normal
wheat
beer
appearance
golden
with
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
a
bit
of
head
and
not
a
lot
of
lacing
it
has
a
wonderful
blueberry
scent
but
unfortunately
the
blueberry
also
overrides
the
wheat
beer
taste
it
goes
down
fine
but
the
aftertaste
is
also
strongly
blueberry
if
youve
ever
had
booberry
cereal
imagine
it
with
wheat
beer
instead
of
milk
its
exactly
as
good
or
as
nasty
as
that
sounds
drinkability
very
high
score
here
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
wheat
beers
and
the
low
abv
means
you
can
drink
quite
a
few
in
an
evening
highly
recommended
and
one
of
the
better
values
out
there
d
a
little
tasty
doesnt
go
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
decent
representation
of
style
even
thought
this
may
not
be
a
particularly
bad
beer
it
just
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
i
like
very
much
however
its
comparable
with
the
majority
of
blueberry
beers
that
ive
had
this
beer
is
one
for
the
ages
if
you
like
fruity
beers
that
taste
like
the
fruit
the
fruit
taste
is
very
powerful
and
you
can
tell
from
when
you
first
pour
it
because
it
smells
like
blueberry
it
is
a
very
sweet
wheat
beer
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
since
the
blueberry
is
so
present
in
the
smell
and
taste
it
is
a
seriously
fruity
beer
that
even
your
8yr
old
daughter
would
enjoy
overall
impression
a
nice
fruit
beer
with
a
little
flaw
its
not
so
bad
that
im
not
enjoying
the
beer
but
it
is
noticeable
worth
a
shot
d
the
best
blueberry
beer
i
have
tried
my
friend
is
always
buying
fruity
beers
for
me
to
try
and
most
fall
short
i
will
retire
this
beer
for
the
season
and
look
forward
to
its
taste
next
summer
every
year
i
inevitably
end
up
with
a
beer
of
the
summer
that
just
stands
out
and
this
year
it
was
sea
dog
blue
paw
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
with
only
slight
undertones
of
blueberry
in
smell
and
finish
a
very
nice
straw
color
adds
to
the
overall
appreciation
not
overly
fruity
as
some
fruit
flavored
wheats
ive
sampled
overall
the
blueberry
flavor
is
very
nicely
integrated
into
the
brew
im
not
a
real
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
the
mixture
of
the
fruit
and
the
wheat
was
heads
and
tails
above
some
others
blueberry
beers
ive
had
like
sweetwater
blue
and
this
was
actually
a
very
enjoyable
beer
given
the
style
that
said
i
echo
the
guy
below
who
wishes
there
was
such
thing
as
a
blueberry
lambic
this
wheat
ale
had
a
very
light
mouth
feel
making
it
a
great
summer
or
session
option
this
beer
paired
great
with
grilled
western
style
burgers
bbq
sauce
cheddar
onion
rings
etc
and
bbq
chicken
dont
think
for
a
second
though
that
this
beer
wont
make
a
sunday
morning
football
breakfast
or
two
some
scrambled
eggs
with
cream
cheese
and
chives
sliced
ham
and
a
blueberry
brew
enjoy
overall
this
is
my
first
blueberry
beer
and
i
have
to
admit
i
quite
enjoyed
it
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
one
or
two
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
sure
hits
the
spot
nicely
the
aroma
is
fantastic
everybody
should
give
this
one
a
try
dont
drink
and
review
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
one
of
these
too
too
sweet
the
taste
on
first
sip
has
a
nice
semi
sweet
blueberry
flavour
that
nicely
compliments
the
flavour
of
wheat
im
also
getting
some
earthy
notes
and
the
finish
ends
up
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
not
bad
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
pronounced
blueberry
flavour
i
wish
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
blueberry
lambic
but
id
buy
this
again
overcarbonated
and
artificial
in
flavor
its
tough
to
make
a
decent
fruitvegbased
ale
and
sea
dog
proves
it
notes
just
ok
to
me
across
the
board
it
was
light
fresh
interesting
and
full
of
flavor
hmmm
judging
by
that
description
it
was
better
than
ok
m
thin
crisp
quenching
and
a
bit
watery
wowif
you
like
blueberries
this
is
your
beer
what
a
wonderful
blueberry
aroma
this
beer
has
it
looks
like
a
typical
ale
and
has
virtually
no
head
it
appears
to
be
highly
carbonated
but
it
could
be
due
to
the
age
of
the
six
pack
i
received
there
isnt
much
body
to
this
beer
but
that
just
leaves
more
room
for
that
blueberry
flavor
i
taste
a
bit
of
hops
for
bittering
but
virtually
no
hop
flavor
is
detectable
they
could
be
there
but
is
overshadowed
by
the
blueberries
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
for
the
summertime
while
eating
fruits
on
the
back
porch
blueberry
this
beer
poured
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
head
was
decent
but
not
long
lasting
the
blueberry
aroma
hit
you
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
opened
the
taste
is
fruity
blueberry
and
slightly
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonated
this
would
be
drinkable
if
you
enjoyed
carbonated
blueberries
it
looks
a
bit
macro
just
a
clear
pale
yellow
brew
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
smells
like
sweet
blueberries
yeast
and
wheat
tastes
like
wheat
and
blueberry
gummiworms
with
slight
malt
kinda
reminds
me
of
frankenberry
cereal
in
beer
form
interesting
to
say
the
least
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
i
could
kick
back
and
have
a
few
of
these
on
the
front
porch
on
a
nice
summer
evening
poured
a
nice
white
head
golden
color
smelled
of
sweet
blueberry
but
not
overly
done
excellent
scent
tastes
wheat
in
front
moving
to
blueberry
and
staying
a
mostly
blueberry
taste
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
compared
to
some
other
berry
ales
that
ive
had
i
think
its
a
good
blend
of
the
tastes
pretty
much
what
i
would
ask
for
in
a
fruit
beer
not
to
much
fruit
and
not
to
little
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
albeit
more
of
a
warm
weather
brew
in
my
opinion
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
in
the
summer
months
in
bottles
to
see
if
it
as
good
bottled
d
some
may
find
it
too
sweet
but
i
like
it
just
fine
its
refreshing
and
would
be
a
great
choice
for
a
breezy
spring
or
summer
day
bouncy
fizzy
feel
deceptively
thickfeeling
considering
its
a
light
and
wheaty
concoction
its
a
very
good
brew
probably
best
for
summer
i
had
it
on
a
freezing
winter
night
goes
down
smooth
but
with
a
nice
mild
bite
appears
a
pale
golden
tone
with
a
quickly
dwindling
white
head
leaves
minimal
lacing
aromatics
it
has
a
tart
blueberry
with
sharpe
wheat
accents
kinda
a
dry
woody
tone
as
weell
flavor
not
overly
sweet
with
the
blueberry
a
nice
balance
of
sharp
acidic
wheat
notes
and
mild
blueberry
flavor
not
like
the
common
alco
pop
versions
that
are
always
at
brewpubs
mouthfeel
is
light
body
evenly
carbonated
easy
drinking
summer
time
feel
drinkability
not
one
i
would
drink
in
number
but
not
a
bad
version
very
solid
for
the
style
d
the
first
time
i
had
a
blueberry
ale
it
was
on
tap
and
it
was
with
real
blueberries
pur
yourself
a
glass
of
this
with
real
blueberries
just
dont
do
it
around
the
guys
lol
best
ale
i
have
had
out
of
the
3
that
i
have
tried
12
oz
bottle
color
of
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
nose
of
blueberry
muffins
raspberry
syrup
and
lightly
hopped

taste
of
blueberry
muffins
yeast
light
malts
and
light
hopps
body
thin
but
creamy
and
lightly
carbonated

aftertaste
of
blueberry
muffins
and
slightly
acidic
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
good
for
a
blueberry
beer
i
poured
this
one
into
my
glass
not
expecting
much
it
was
a
dark
golden
yellow
with
no
head
and
little
carbonation
i
actually
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
it
had
a
nice
smell
and
taste
of
blueberries
the
blueberries
did
not
seem
to
be
too
artifical
and
not
overly
sweet
i
would
definetly
go
for
this
one
again
in
the
future
d
not
bad
i
suppose
if
i
wanted
a
blueberry
beer
this
would
be
my
first
choice
or
i
could
just
eat
a
blueberry
and
slam
a
lager
and
get
a
similar
effect
nonetheless
its
what
it
says
it
is
and
isnt
disgustingly
repulsive
worth
trying
but
keep
it
away
from
your
kids
it
would
likely
remind
them
of
trix
tastes
just
like
it
smells
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
resembling
yeast
and
malt
not
bad
not
very
good
but
not
bad
nothing
more
i
can
say
about
this
except
that
it
wont
gag
you
no
reason
to
really
seek
this
beer
out
at
all
d
ill
take
water
instead
thanks
mouthfeel
is
reminiscent
of
soda
water
way
too
effervescent
this
beer
was
way
too
fakely
sweet
could
barely
share
a
bottle
with
a
friend
blecch
bham
uk
written
while
in
tampa
fl
oct
2006
a
very
strange
combination
to
me
but
i
suppose
they
get
what
they
are
seeking
to
me
it
is
too
much
like
an
alcopop
again
this
one
is
super
refreshing
great
beer
for
a
hot
afternoon
i
picked
up
a
sixer
at
trader
joes
to
help
rally
the
dodgers
in
the
06
playoffs
go
blue
no
luck
there
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
drinkability
of
all
the
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
this
one
stands
out
as
one
of
the
best
imo
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
the
blueberry
flavoring
easily
makes
this
one
very
enjoyable
not
exactly
one
that
i
would
drink
a
six
pack
of
in
one
sitting
but
one
that
i
would
enjoy
after
a
meal
or
maybe
during
a
session
for
a
little
change
of
flavor
subtle
it
was
not
it
was
like
drinking
warm
blueberry
muffins
or
pankakes
at
ihop
drinkability
drank
about
half
and
walked
away
to
do
something
else
was
ok
but
would
not
run
out
to
buy
more
d
cant
say
i
really
care
for
this
one
a
good
idea
just
not
made
very
well
probly
wouldnt
drink
again
its
hard
to
describe
the
taste
of
the
beer
as
the
blueberry
syrup
seems
to
overpower
anything
else
there
is
some
carbonation
which
helps
if
you
think
of
it
more
as
a
blueberry
soda
that
kinda
tastes
weird
as
a
beer
though
its
terrible
im
not
sure
about
the
wheat
part
if
its
there
the
fruit
has
gobbled
it
up
it
was
difficult
to
finish
no
thanks
i
doubt
id
buy
this
again
just
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
a
must
try
for
those
just
starting
to
try
fruit
beers
tasted
090706
its
an
amber
color
that
has
zero
head
i
bet
you
can
guess
what
it
smells
like
its
more
of
a
blueberry
muffin
aroma
since
its
full
on
the
sweet
tip
and
that
goes
for
the
taste
too
before
i
knew
it
i
did
drink
the
entire
contents
but
that
might
be
more
to
the
credit
of
monday
night
football
being
on
and
thats
drinking
time
i
must
say
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
although
its
not
a
style
i
come
back
to
with
great
regularity
this
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
beverage
especially
since
seadog
chose
to
take
the
dogfish
route
make
the
fruit
implied
instead
of
essentially
making
blueberry
juice
beer
like
they
did
with
the
hazelnut
in
their
porter
yuck
an
exceptionally
easy
beer
to
drink
when
next
summer
rolls
around
ill
be
sure
to
keep
a
few
bottles
of
this
handy
light
body
and
no
noticable
alcohol
make
this
a
hot
summer
drinker
that
goes
down
easily
definitely
one
of
my
top
blueberry
beers
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
smells
of
sweet
blueberries
that
mirrored
the
taste
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
wheat
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
little
while
very
drinkable
for
a
sweet
fruit
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
little
head
aroma
is
blueberries
with
a
bit
of
grain
in
the
background
taste
is
all
about
blueberries
as
well
with
a
nice
twang
from
the
malt
the
blueberry
flavor
does
not
overwhelm
the
beer
and
it
doesnt
suffer
from
being
cloyingly
sweet
all
in
all
a
pretty
decent
brew
thats
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
first
had
this
blueberry
elixir
when
i
went
camping
with
my
buddys
in
georgia
i
dont
mind
a
sweet
beer
which
is
what
it
exactly
was
like
a
liquid
blueberry
muffin
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
i
ended
up
drink
about
ten
with
a
bunch
of
other
ones
because
they
were
so
good
drinkability
in
my
opinion
the
best
blueberry
beer
around
nicely
balanced
with
a
soft
fade
at
the
end
not
a
bite
around
i
would
indeed
order
another
going
from
great
aroma
to
average
taste
what
a
let
down
a
sweet
blueberry
taste
but
watered
down
over
filtered
can
taste
the
wheat
good
clean
carbonation
it
says
on
the
label
wheat
ale
with
natural
flavors
natural
flavors
why
not
say
blueberries
i
am
a
bit
suspicious
i
had
this
last
night
in
a
bottle
poured
nice
and
golden
the
aroma
is
fabulous
just
like
blueberry
muffins
it
was
a
good
beer
for
a
summer
night
light
and
crisp
it
was
a
subtle
blueberry
taste
and
it
lingers
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
before
winter
comes
drinkability
is
ok
if
i
liked
this
sort
of
thing
im
sure
i
would
have
several
in
a
session
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
solid
fruit
brew
that
is
worth
a
few
drinkability
good
not
great
an
interesting
beer
for
a
summers
night
it
is
what
it
is
a
blueberry
wheat
big
on
the
blueberries
for
the
style
it
is
pretty
good
would
not
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
if
i
wanted
a
blueberry
flavored
wheat
this
is
one
i
would
look
for
dk
solid
blueberry
brew
the
only
one
better
off
the
top
of
my
head
was
the
town
hall
version
but
this
is
quite
sound
a
very
different
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
interested
in
fruit
beers
or
like
blueberries
pours
a
filtered
gold
color
with
a
quickly
dissapearing
lace
aroma
is
kind
of
an
artificially
produced
blueberry
smell
my
first
thought
when
smelling
this
was
that
it
reminded
me
of
the
flavored
smelling
markers
that
i
grew
up
with
as
a
kid
tastes
very
similar
to
a
blueberry
muffin
actually
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
couple
of
these
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
a
blueberry
muffin
definately
worth
a
try
the
blueberry
in
this
brew
gets
cloying
after
awhile
limiting
drinkability
this
beer
is
way
too
sweet
from
my
taste
almost
wine
cooler
sweet
it
was
disappointing
as
ive
had
blueberry
wheats
at
beer
festivals
that
i
really
liked
and
would
prefer
over
this
one
however
my
wife
loved
it
overall
a
light
and
refreshing
blueberry
beer
highly
drinkable
floating
a
few
blueberries
in
this
beer
really
enhances
the
fruit
flavor
i
think
this
tops
the
marin
bluebeery
offering
with
a
more
natural
and
subtle
flavor
i
like
it
this
might
be
okay
if
you
are
looking
for
a
blueberry
taste
on
a
hot
day
it
seems
more
like
a
summerrelease
beer
than
a
yearroundrelease
beer
d
very
drinkable
mainly
due
to
sweetness
ive
got
a
sweettooth
and
smoothness
good
desert
beer
for
the
summer
poured
a
dark
blonde
leaving
a
thin
white
lace
with
heavy
carbonation
bubbles
in
the
body
the
nose
is
obviously
blueberries
with
small
wheat
bready
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
blueberry
a
little
musty
with
a
nice
wheat
twang
to
spice
up
this
nominal
brew
the
finish
is
smooth
very
drinkable
but
nothing
exciting
and
probably
will
not
go
back
to
this
brew
except
on
a
hot
summer
day
sea
dog
blue
paw
wheat
ale
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
this
beer
definitely
smells
like
blueberry
taste
is
actually
better
than
i
expected
a
rush
of
blueberry
followed
quickly
by
wheat
its
not
too
sweet
i
was
afraid
this
was
going
to
taste
like
bubblegum
not
bad
its
not
really
my
thing
but
possibly
a
good
beer
to
introduce
non
craft
beer
drinkers
to
blue
paw
pours
a
yellowy
or
light
orange
color
it
is
clear
with
a
decent
sized
but
quickly
dissolving
white
head
smell
is
a
good
mix
of
wheat
and
blueberry
up
front
very
clean
and
crisp
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
wheat
presence
right
away
blueberry
is
not
as
potent
up
front
but
becomes
more
notable
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
a
bit
watery
but
pleasant
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
pretty
liight
and
somewhat
fizzy
it
does
have
a
decent
crisp
presence
though
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
decent
though
not
earthshattering
effort
would
be
refershing
on
a
warm
summers
day
but
no
more
so
than
dozens
of
other
comprable
or
better
beers
12
ounce

drinkability
a
decent
fruit
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
the
style
very
drinkable
the
bottom
line
a
fairly
average
wheat
beer
with
blueberry
tones
to
spruce
it
up
slightly
nothing
worth
seeking
out
it
pours
light
and
translucent
a
yellowish
gold
color
and
it
definitely
smells
of
blueberries
with
a
somewhat
hoppy
smell
as
well
there
is
a
pale
off
white
colored
head
the
blueberry
flavor
is
just
a
little
sweet
perhaps
too
sweet
for
some
but
thats
why
i
like
it
i
guess
it
sort
of
comes
off
tasting
like
a
light
beer
but
with
the
blueberry
flavor
it
feels
smooth
in
your
mouth
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
as
well
it
is
a
fast
drink
its
cool
and
refreshing
and
now
that
it
is
getting
warmer
out
i
will
likely
enjoy
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
body
was
light
overall
the
smell
said
big
blueberries
but
the
flavor
didnt
come
through
i
would
suggest
to
keep
fishing
but
the
girlfriend
enjoyed
it
overall
i
think
i
liked
this
a
little
better
when
it
was
a
popular
cereal
but
as
it
is
it
isnt
too
bad
for
an
experimental
fruit
beer
had
off
tap
at
coles
in
buffalo
pours
with
if
nothing
else
below
average
appearence
not
much
head
stale
gold
in
colour
aroma
of
blueberry
hit
me
from
across
the
table
all
of
us
around
the
table
could
honestly
all
smell
it
very
clear
bright
smell
blueberries
both
the
aroma
and
flavour
were
very
authentic
no
sythentic
or
syrop
detected
true
blueberry
profile
for
sure
they
must
add
them
to
the
mash
left
me
with
the
taste
of
blueberry
pancakesmuffins
all
day
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
barnyardfarmhouse
presence
slightly
dry
and
perhaps
a
little
musty
not
fruity
in
the
sense
of
fruitlambics
nothing
fruit
juicy
about
it
it
smells
like
blueberries
before
and
taste
like
blueberries
after
but
the
whole
middle
part
is
beer
drinkability
not
sure
i
could
finish
off
a
sixer
just
get
sick
of
the
blueberry
taste
split
a
sixpack
with
the
old
lady
is
just
perfect
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
you
can
get
past
the
sweetness
works
well
as
breakfast
or
dessert
beer
fruitty
beer
lovers
will
enjoy
this
d
it
isnt
hard
to
drink
the
flavor
isnt
strong
so
it
could
even
be
sessioned
all
around
bland
and
uninspired
well
maybe
it
was
inspired
by
instant
blueberry
pancakes
app
pours
out
as
a
medium
golden
almost
light
copper
color
body
with
just
a
minimal
white
head
forming
the
nose
reaches
out
with
very
fresh
blueberry
greeting
just
barely
hazy
with
a
little
bubbly
sm
well
fresh
blueberries
really
nice
effect
also
some
toasty
cerealwheat
aroma
tamf
the
balance
of
sweet
fruit
and
wheat
ale
is
wonderful
so
often
a
wheat
ale
fusion
like
this
doesnt
work
out
that
this
is
a
very
welcome
surprise
da
high
this
would
be
a
good
dessert
beer
but
it
would
also
have
enough
yarbles
to
be
a
session
ale
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
highly
carbonated
easily
drinkable
but
very
sweet
ss
something
different
though
not
anything
id
buy
on
a
regular
basis
very
drinkable
great
blueberry
flavor
and
easy
drinking
could
use
more
complexity
as
a
beer
but
makes
for
a
nice
fruit
beer
d
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
i
found
it
refreshing
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
pours
a
very
pale
yellowish
amber
big
blueberry
nose
with
a
very
sweet
undertone
kind
of
smells
like
those
fake
blueberriesinsyrup
that
you
get
in
a
can
the
palate
is
balanced
with
a
semisweet
blueberry
flavor
acting
against
a
bitter
hop
character
the
balance
works
pretty
well
but
theres
too
much
of
a
syrupy
aftereffect
in
the
mouthfell
its
kind
of
thick
and
phlegmy
in
the
throat
still
overall
this
is
an
ok
fruit
beer
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
though
so
i
cant
say
i
recommend
it
overall
not
much
of
a
beer
itd
be
okay
to
drink
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
dont
think
it
has
that
much
more
to
offer
sdbcbpwbwa
is
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
that
needs
to
be
slightly
more
flavorful
and
a
tad
less
fizzilicious
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
my
favorite
blueberry
ale
from
another
maine
brewer
atlantic
brewing
company
but
its
still
a
worthwhile
brew
that
would
be
a
good
summertime
quencher
if
i
lived
in
the
pine
tree
state
its
like
a
cheap
lager
with
way
too
much
blueberry
smell
the
weird
thing
is
the
smell
is
way
stronger
than
the
taste
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
but
it
might
be
good
for
someone
graduating
from
the
college
crowd
to
something
resembling
a
well
crafted
beer
ive
had
one
other
blueberry
beer
and
that
was
delicious
something
i
would
buy
again
for
an
evening
to
waste
away
on
the
porch
in
summer
but
this
beer
gets
a
big
thumbs
down
will
never
buy
this
brew
again
i
really
think
that
this
is
an
average
beer
but
it
is
certainly
unique
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
like
many
other
flavored
beer
i
find
it
hard
to
drink
even
an
entire
glass
of
this
unless
i
think
wine
cooler
instead
of
beer
i
like
beer
to
taste
like
beer
but
this
is
certainly
a
fun
one
to
taste
i
drink
these
straight
from
the
bottle
but
if
poured
into
a
glass
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
a
strong
blueberry
scent
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
great
taste
of
the
blueberries
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
light
by
my
standards
but
still
should
be
tried
at
least
once
do
to
its
great
blueberry
taste
that
is
leftover
at
the
finish
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
that
i
recomend
to
any
fan
of
fruit
beers
opened
up
this
wheatymicro
from
bangorand
immediatly
smelled
much
maine
wild
blueberry
poured
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
was
a
nice
clear
light
gold
color
with
a
thin
disipating
head
a
fine
head
was
maintained
with
a
medium
carbonation
rate
taken
to
the
nose
very
floral
hops
and
strong
presense
of
definate
blueberry
smelled
like
it
could
be
a
breakfast
cereal
blue
flowery
taste
with
light
maltiness
medium
bubbly
mothfeel
i
found
this
sea
dog
to
be
very
drinkable
although
i
would
not
drink
many
as
im
not
really
into
the
fruity
ales
of
the
ones
ive
had
its
the
best
at
4
6
4
95
abv
normal
pleasant
effect
to
the
brain
and
senses
was
achieved
pours
a
copper
golden
color
with
no
head
smells
of
blueberries
right
from
the
start
also
a
hint
of
maltyness
strong
taste
of
blueberriesvery
sweet
being
a
wheat
blueberry
ale
i
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
not
bitter
but
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
pretty
average
even
for
a
fruit
beer
a
bit
too
artificial
and
one
dimentional
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
airy
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
nice
with
an
buttload
of
blueberrys
and
fruit
flavors
the
taste
is
similar
but
of
artificial
blueberry
flavors
also
there
is
the
wheat
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
light
malt
flavors
this
is
an
oversweet
ale
that
is
fairly
drinkable
the
color
is
lighter
than
i
like
and
the
head
was
pretty
small
this
has
a
full
blueberry
aromait
will
fill
your
whole
house
if
you
like
blueberrys
you
will
like
this
it
has
a
full
strong
flavor
not
really
a
real
traditional
ale
flavor
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
it
tastes
great
with
real
blueberrys
in
it
my
girlfriend
loves
this
beer
this
beer
poured
with
a
golden
hue
a
thin
head
that
is
no
longer
with
us
the
smell
is
of
blueberries
imagine
that
this
beer
is
actually
good
for
a
beer
i
can
see
through
there
is
no
bite
usually
associated
with
light
beers
no
stronge
aftertaste
since
there
is
no
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
darn
good
the
drinkability
is
more
than
i
expected
from
a
lighter
beer
drinking
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
explore
sea
dog
more
thouroghly
feel
is
a
tad
over
carbonated
hard
on
the
swallow
at
first
but
quickly
is
set
aside
by
one
very
light
body
and
nearly
watery
based
middle
and
finish
almost
less
then
average
for
a
wheat
based
beer
but
its
overall
super
clean
and
crisply
quick
setting
is
more
then
adequate
for
drinkin
it
down
with
favorable
ease
no
head
as
poured
at
bar
from
the
tap
a
golden
translucent
color
strong
blueberry
and
citrus
nose
typical
of
a
wheat
beer
good
witbier
flavor
citrusy
wheat
and
yeast
flavors
coupled
with
blueberries
taste
is
perhaps
sweet
to
a
fault
mouth
is
watery
and
flat
possibly
due
to
a
fault
of
the
tap
drinkability
is
good
though
overly
sweet
overall
an
above
average
witbier
overall
a
really
nice
brew
for
its
intentions
its
well
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
there
is
a
definate
wheat
background
on
par
with
bar
harbor
blueberry
although
the
two
are
different
in
flavor
dark
gold
in
color
very
little
head
and
lacing
smells
like
my
moms
blueberry
pie
smell
lasts
taste
is
very
sweet
and
artificial
or
not
it
taste
like
blueberries
mouthfeel
of
mild
carbonation
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
and
makes
you
want
another
perfect
beer
to
take
the
lady
on
a
pic
nic
with
my
wife
loves
this
beer
as
do
most
women
i
know
also
a
great
beer
to
introduce
your
macro
friends
to
craft
beer
drinkability
this
could
go
over
well
with
the
ladies
maybe
since
it
doesnt
have
the
fullest
body
or
a
great
amount
of
flavor
the
blueberry
could
be
enough
to
make
a
session
out
of
and
i
dont
mean
that
to
rip
on
women
at
all
but
for
a
girlfriend
wife
who
may
not
be
the
biggest
beer
fan
they
make
like
this
or
if
you
like
fruit
beers
you
may
like
this
also
but
i
imagine
surely
there
are
better
ones
out
there
than
this
drinkability
is
of
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
these
and
i
dont
usually
get
attracted
to
them
but
my
wife
and
friend
had
this
and
i
decided
to
check
it
out
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pours
a
shocking
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
pure
white
head
for
some
reason
i
expected
a
blue
hue
ok
the
nose
is
quite
aromatic

freshly
picked
blueberries
dominate
there
is
a
sort
of
syrupy
aroma
as
well
medium
bodied
fresh
tasting
and
to
no
surprise
a
blast
of
blueberries
on
the
initial
quaff
a
blast
of
malts
on
the
palate
just
a
bit
creamy
and
bitter
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
quite
refreshing
more
than
a
couple
though
and
im
getting
bored
would
love
to
pair
this
with
hot
apple
pie
ala
mode
as
soon
as
the
cap
is
released
this
brew
exudes
blueberry
aromas
they
just
leap
out
of
the
bottle
and
never
end
their
olfactory
assault
at
first
its
nice
like
a
fresh
blueberry
piebut
then
it
turns
into
a
sicky
distraction
like
an
unwelcome
blueberry
snowcone
they
overdid
the
fruit
on
this
onefor
sure
the
liquid
is
clear
unobtrusive
gold
color
with
a
negligible
head
no
hop
aroma
or
at
least
its
not
discernable
through
the
berries
the
taste
is
a
little
grainy
and
very
crisp
its
not
what
i
would
call
sweet
at
all
the
finish
has
a
little
bitterness
thats
the
only
welcome
distraction
for
the
fruit
tone
down
the
berry
big
froathy
bright
white
head
fades
briskly
to
a
thin
ring
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
rise
gingerly
from
the
bottom
of
the
transparent
golden
beer
faint
floral
aroma
with
blueberry
undertones
fairly
crisp
lemony
wheat
beer
flavor
up
front
with
a
dash
of
toasted
malts
blueberries
fade
in
towards
in
the
middle
and
hold
on
all
the
way
through
the
finish
a
nice
fruit
beer
the
blueberry
tastes
natural
and
blends
well
with
the
beer
thanks
to
my
brother
for
this
bottle
this
poured
with
a
nice
bone
white
head
that
just
evaporated
it
had
a
huge
blueberry
nose
like
blueberry
pancakes
it
was
a
very
clear
light
yellow
color
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
light
and
dare
i
say
it
fizzy
still
there
was
a
light
blueberry
taste
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
is
dry
but
with
the
same
blueberry
intenseness
that
i
noted
on
the
nose
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
even
for
those
of
us
that
may
not
be
huge
fans
of
fruit
beers
a
refreshing
beer
and
nice
change
of
pace
pours
a
standard
amber
color
a
little
darker
than
straw
colored
a
little
creamy
head
and
a
slight
lacing
good
carbonation
was
served
with
some
blueberries
in
the
glass
a
good
garnish
i
smelled
the
beer
even
before
it
was
put
in
front
of
me
wafts
of
blueberries
with
a
mild
wheat
background
in
the
nose
taste
was
a
little
subdued
i
felt
the
blueberries
and
wheat
flavors
were
a
good
balance
but
did
not
fill
the
beer
a
very
drinkable
choice
though
fakeish
blueberry
flavor
and
mediocre
wheat
beer
character
reminiscent
flavors
of
a
certain
brewery
within
my
own
state
and
follows
suit
in
a
bland
and
uninteresting
build
might
be
suitable
for
those
seeking
a
somewhat
refreshing
beer
with
a
touch
of
fruit
flavor
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
this
is
an
easy
drinking
high
quality
beer
that
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
i
love
it
wierd
texture
to
this
beerfeels
like
my
tongue
is
coated
in
blueberry
syrup
the
beer
poured
pale
amber
with
very
little
head
to
it
the
nose
was
full
of
blueberries
the
hops
were
hardly
present
and
were
very
much
muted
by
the
blueberry
flavoring
very
sweet
the
finish
just
hovers
within
my
nasal
cavity
and
cannot
go
away
while
not
overly
fond
of
this
beer
i
could
see
how
nonhopheads
would
like
it
myself
ill
drink
it
in
moderation
this
beer
pours
a
darker
golden
color
and
produces
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
like
blueberries
found
in
cereal
taste
is
blueberry
all
the
way
with
some
light
malting
mouthfeel
is
like
blueberry
seltzer
with
nothing
else
really
for
your
tastebuds
to
latch
onto
good
on
a
summer
day
along
with
some
blueberry
pie
disgustingly
sweet
soda
pop
artificial
essence
blueberry
this
beverage
is
often
mixed
with
something
else
not
so
drinkable
to
me
but
perhaps
more
appreciated
by
fruit
beer
lovers
or
children
watery
and
light
colour
overly
carbonated
which
may
not
be
the
fault
at
underground
bluz
in
orlando
but
hey
it
sells
in
florida
not
the
greatest
beer
afficiando
part
of
the
world
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
wisp
of
crispness
at
the
start
the
finish
was
crisp
and
that
fake
blueberry
flavor
lingered
briefly
one
of
these
is
more
than
enough
unless
you
are
a
fan
of
this
fruit
brew
a
tremendous
blueberry
aroma
hits
your
nose
the
moment
you
pop
the
cap
off
the
bottle
the
color
is
a
dull
pale
orange
with
a
very
small
white
head
the
aroma
stays
strong
as
it
sits
in
the
glass
smells
like
blueberry
syrup
or
blueberry
jam
no
hops
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
blueberry
soda
the
blueberries
assault
your
taste
buds
cloyingly
sweet
im
pouring
blueberry
flavored
syrup
into
my
mouth
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
more
traditional
beer
tastes
assert
themselves
namely
hops
but
are
quickly
chased
away
by
the
sickingly
sweet
blueberries
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
like
sucking
on
a
blueberry
drinkability
is
horrible
due
to
the
overwhelming
blueberry
sweetness
ive
had
blueberry
beers
that
ive
really
enjoyed
bar
harbor
for
one
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
like
the
blueberry
flavor
to
stay
in
the
background
as
a
nice
subtle
flavoring
this
one
hits
you
over
the
head
and
you
mistake
it
for
beer
flavored
blueberry
soda
this
the
first
blueberry
ale
ive
tried
and
blueberry
always
seemed
an
unlikely
beer
flavoring
aroma
was
sweet
and
sodapopish
with
blueberry
and
peach
soda
notes
flavor
profile
was
reasonably
crisp
and
light
in
a
typically
american
wheat
way
the
blueberry
flavor
was
well
moderated
again
lending
a
sodapop
note
much
like
a
nehi
fruit
soda
although
the
blueberry
flavor
stood
out
as
more
of
an
adjunct
flavoring
than
a
brewing
element
i
found
myself
rather
enjoying
this
beer
for
what
it
was
would
be
nice
to
throw
a
couple
in
the
cooler
for
some
variety
on
the
lake
this
is
a
straw
colored
ale
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissapears
quickly
a
pervassive
blueberry
aroma
that
gets
your
attention
as
you
pour
nothing
else
seems
to
be
able
through
the
blueberry
aroma
there
is
a
prickly
spicey
hoppiness
that
balances
the
strong
fruity
sweet
blueberry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
yet
sharp
in
carbonation
if
youre
looking
for
blueberries
drink
up
other
than
the
halo
of
head
around
its
edges
there
was
no
carbonation
present
likely
due
to
poor
rinsing
of
the
glass
after
washing
consisting
of
a
very
light
straw
hue
the
offering
was
crystal
clear
and
a
constant
cascade
of
bubbles
made
up
for
the
poor
showing
that
the
us
mens
water
polo
team
was
putting
on
at
the
time
on
the
joints
televisions
not
surprisingly
blueberries
were
the
prevalent
olfactory
note
with
a
light
undertone
of
malt
as
well
to
prop
it
up
on
the
palate
the
blueberries
cannot
be
ignored
but
there
was
also
a
touch
of
lemon
as
well
as
a
light
cherry
note
strangely
enough
on
the
whole
i
would
not
choose
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
pours
as
the
blueberries
are
just
overpowering
thankfully
at
least
it
wasnt
served
with
actual
blueberries
floating
around
it
lava
lampstyle
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
fades
absolutely
no
lacing
either
sweet
blueberry
pie
aroma
kind
of
taste
like
blueberry
pie
too
light
body
and
mouthfeel
finishes
sweet
for
what
its
worth
i
like
it
better
than
the
raspberry
wheat
and
thats
not
saying
much
the
head
was
disappointing
vanished
immediately
its
spritzy
character
suggests
that
it
might
be
a
good
summer
brew
but
not
for
me
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
dense
but
shortlived
34
white
head
above
the
clear
bright
straw
brew
little
to
no
lacing
present
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
blueberry
aroma
somewhat
artificial
but
yet
still
good
taste
has
a
wheat
character
but
flavor
is
all
about
the
blueberries
however
the
wheat
flavor
is
such
that
it
cuts
through
the
sweetness
so
as
not
to
allow
it
get
cloying
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
heartier
for
a
wheat
brew
and
drinkability
is
good
a
refreshing
brew
in
the
warm
weather
and
one
of
the
few
fruit
brews
that
i
would
recommend
nice
blueberry
ale
im
not
sure
how
much
wheat
is
in
this
beer
its
good
but
there
is
something
artificial
about
this
beer
and
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
a
supermarket
nearby
recently
began
selling
this
beer
at
10
99
a
12
pack
which
is
very
respectable
i
love
to
support
maine
brewed
beer
but
this
is
not
my
first
choice
being
from
new
england
and
a
lover
of
blueberries
i
was
really
rooting
for
this
one
unfortunately
this
one
misses
the
mark
this
is
definitely
a
fruit
beer
as
the
blueberries
make
their
presence
known
in
each
sip
the
fruit
is
balanced
well
by
the
wheat
which
provides
a
nice
backbone
overall
leaves
a
dry
taste
in
the
mouth
and
the
taste
of
blueberries
booberry
cereal
anyone
for
me
i
loved
this
beer
that
blueberry
taste
through
and
through
it
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
head
little
bubbles
came
up
from
the
bottom
and
sides
through
the
whole
glass
smelled
the
blueberries
the
minute
i
popped
the
top
tasted
just
the
way
it
smelled
all
i
could
think
of
was
booberry
cereal
my
favorite
as
a
kid
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
had
this
one
by
the
pool
then
again
for
dessert
after
dinner
glad
i
had
a
6
pack
great
summer
beer
nice
clear
straw
with
white
head
a
little
rl
smells
of
fake
or
strong
extracted
blueberries
certainly
not
subtle
flavor
is
sweet
and
bubbly
graininess
a
hint
of
tartness
finishes
dry
and
bitter
in
a
very
unpleasant
way
bland
and
onedimensional
feel
is
fizzly
and
very
dry
finish
an
annoying
beer
could
have
worked
if
it
was
more
subtle
and
had
a
lasting
sweetness
that
blueberries
usually
have
the
dry
graininess
does
not
work
with
the
overthetop
blueberry
i
will
not
have
this
again
last
swigs
sometimes
novelty
beers
have
an
aftertaste
that
counters
the
fruitiness
with
a
tacky
cloying
syrup
sendoff
this
one
does
that
also
lends
to
a
lower
drinkability
i
enjoy
different
flavors
to
break
things
up
seadog
is
a
pleasant
blueberry
wheat
that
does
just
that
the
flavor
lasts
throughout
the
drink
even
the
burps
taste
like
blueberries
smelled
blueberry
as
soon
as
i
uncapped
it
poured
a
golden
pilsener
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
smells
like
artificial
blueberry
flavoring
not
picking
up
on
much
wheat
ale
characteristics
because
the
blueberry
is
that
overwhelming
very
sweet
again
in
an
artificial
way
like
they
made
a
batch
of
beer
and
dumped
a
ton
of
blueberry
flavored
gourmet
jelly
beans
in
it
cant
say
im
enjoying
this
one
too
much
and
i
love
blueberries
if
i
want
to
reproduce
this
sensation
in
the
future
ill
just
buy
a
pack
of
blueberry
hubba
bubba
and
chew
a
piece
while
drinking
a
cheap
hefeweizen
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
has
sweet
malts
and
some
blueberry
though
it
is
not
that
strong
the
blueberry
taste
hits
up
front
and
then
fades
into
the
sweet
grains
it
is
not
too
bitter
but
just
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
and
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
sweetness
a
decent
warm
weather
drinker
beacuse
it
is
relatively
light
clean
and
refreshing
the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
spotty
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
blueberry
scent
which
blends
nicely
with
the
wheat
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
poor
it
is
weak
and
watered
down
with
a
slight
hint
of
blueberry
taste
it
has
no
malt
character
and
little
fruit
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
but
it
falls
short
of
many
fruit
beers
ive
had
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
fruit
brew
definitely
a
nice
fruit
beer
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
at
a
time
probably
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
ive
had
some
fine
beverages
from
sea
dog
so
i
was
excited
about
this
offering
unfortunately
sea
dog
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
for
this
one
it
certainly
has
a
lovely
amber
color
although
it
pours
a
bit
thin
the
feel
is
slightly
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
kind
of
like
having
one
too
many
pop
rocks
the
blueberry
style
is
what
attracted
me
to
begin
with
however
it
seems
like
sea
dog
concocted
a
wheat
beer
added
some
blueberry
concentrate
spent
a
bit
of
time
in
the
board
room
trying
to
think
of
a
clever
name
and
voila
blue
paw
wild
blueberry
wheat
ale
i
admire
the
effort
but
this
one
needs
a
bit
more
work
hmmm
another
maine
beer
makes
it
down
to
pa
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
here
goes
it
a
light
goldenyellow
colour
with
a
bit
of
a
frothy
white
head
aromas
are
on
the
subtle
side
with
some
blueberry
syrup
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
that
of
a
lackluster
wheat
beer
with
some
ihop
blueberry
syrup
thrown
into
the
mix
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
just
average
an
average
fruit
beer
i
expect
more
from
maine
beer
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
sip
on
occasionally
though
i
can
think
of
many
others
that
would
fit
that
category
much
better
and
be
more
satisfying
the
singularity
and
artificiality
of
the
blueberry
in
this
beer
is
a
bit
much
to
get
me
really
excited
about
it
well
i
bought
this
for
the
other
half
and
she
really
liked
itme
well
it
was
ok
poured
light
golden
color
with
a
almost
nonexistant
headaroma
was
booberry
cereal
in
a
glass
artificial
blueberry
and
toasted
malt
aromasnow
saying
its
artificial
doesnt
really
bother
me
it
actually
smelled
decent
i
thinkflavor
was
of
malted
wheat
and
blueberry
not
to
overly
bad
but
i
wouldnt
get
again
i
dont
think
tastes
of
blueberries
of
course
leaves
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
this
is
similiar
to
their
raspberry
wheat
ale
but
the
blueberries
are
tart
and
offer
more
bitterness
adding
to
the
complexity
of
the
taste
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
aftertaste
a
decent
ale
but
i
will
probably
leave
the
rest
for
my
wife
pours
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
stay
not
leaving
any
lace
pale
golden
color
the
nose
is
a
strong
sweet
blueberry
and
taste
is
a
strong
sweet
blueberry
with
the
malts
and
some
hops
nice
clean
crisp
finish
very
good
fruit
beer
light
bodied
normally
dont
drink
the
fruit
beers
but
this
was
in
the
fridge
and
i
said
what
the
hey
lets
give
it
a
shot
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
great
either
straw
color
with
a
medium
white
froth
smell
was
just
blueberries
i
couldnt
get
any
other
type
of
smell
from
this
taste
was
of
sweet
malts
and
blueberries
not
a
bad
taste
it
was
a
tad
too
sweet
but
after
a
little
while
you
get
used
to
it
all
in
all
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
great
normally
i
turn
my
nose
up
at
fruit
beers
but
in
this
case
i
will
make
an
exception
the
reason
for
this
exception
is
simple
i
can
mix
it
with
guinness
for
those
of
you
who
have
never
tasted
a
black
and
blue
as
some
call
it
treat
yourself
it
mutes
the
blueberry
beers
normally
overpowering
sweetness
and
becomes
an
entirely
different
animal
cheers
notessugar
taste
almost
like
cotton
candy
a
bit
acidic
also
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
nose
definitely
blueberry
as
far
as
taste
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
bottle
of
bud
light
with
an
essence
of
blueberry
there
was
really
very
little
special
about
this
beer
i
wouldnt
waste
my
money
on
this
one
again
say
no
to
bluberrry
ale
the
flavor
is
blueberry
all
the
way
through
in
good
proportion
to
the
wheat
malt
definitely
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
the
finish
is
a
nice
blueberry
wheat
grainy
malt
balance
a
very
tasty
fruit
wheat
beer
once
you
get
past
the
nose
definitely
better
straight
from
the
bottle
imo
same
straw
color
as
the
raspberry
beer
thin
faint
white
head
lasted
a
little
longer
smell
was
more
subtle
on
the
fruit
side
and
better
defined
beer
wise
some
noticable
malt
taste
then
big
blueberry
kick
grainy
taste
is
also
less
noticable
stands
alone
better
than
the
raspberry
beer
light
bodied
and
refreshing
i
suggest
mixing
this
one
with
a
stout
as
well
makes
for
a
nice
summer
refresher
with
some
body
notes
a
pretty
good
fruit
ale
with
some
character
on
the
side
tastes
more
of
ginger
than
of
grapefruit
not
bad
but
except
for
the
alcohol
id
rather
just
have
a
ginger
ale
cranberry
beer
not
very
good
this
is
good
for
what
it
is
lots
of
grapefruit
some
ginger
in
the
background
very
refreshing
i
wont
probably
have
it
again
taste
like
bland
ginger
ale
i
love
how
refreshing
this
beer
can
be
on
a
hot
day
crisp
ginger
flavor
with
underlying
grapefruit
notes
very
light
mouth
feel
with
a
lingering
ginger
taste
drinkable
and
not
very
sweet
if
it
were
a
bit
worse
i
might
guess
it
was
a
mass
produced
flavored
beer
good
for
what
it
is
very
drinkable
a
really
well
crafted
spiced
brew
this
is
a
well
balanced
spiced
beer
very
enjoyable
with
a
small
white
head
and
excellent
spicy
aroma
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
producing
1
finger
of
rapidly
diminishing
slightly
offwhite
champagnelike
head
that
leaves
not
a
hint
of
lacing
aroma
is
remarkably
reminiscent
of
buffalo
rock
ginger
ale
with
hints
of
grapefruit
caramel
lemonlime
grain
in
that
order
taste
is
overwhelmingly
ginger
more
canada
drylike
in
the
mouth
with
hints
of
grapefruit
lemonlime
caramel
mineral
water
finishes
thin
lemonlime
citrusy
with
a
ginger
peppery
spiciness
aftertaste
is
a
shortlived
low
level
citrus
mineral
in
a
thin
bitterness
before
fading
to
an
afterthought
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
thin
watery
with
lively
carbonation
dry
spicy
prickly
i
must
confess
that
my
rating
is
based
on
personal
prefence
not
on
parameters
merits
within
the
style
as
i
not
sure
that
i
have
ever
had
a
representative
of
the
style
that
i
liked
and
would
drink
again
refreshing
with
a
moderate
amount
of
true
ginger
flavor
and
spiciness
similar
to
a
ginger
soda
in
both
flavor
and
mouthfeel
which
is
both
a
good
and
bad
thing
for
a
beer
for
me
it
is
just
too
watery
and
sodalike
to
be
taken
seriously
outlier
detected
please
enter
a
review
the
beer
pours
with
a
thin
fizzy
soda
like
head
which
vanishes
seconds
later
right
off
the
bat
you
are
hit
hard
with
ginger
and
citrus
on
the
nose
it
almost
smells
like
some
sort
of
fresh
ginger
cocktail
the
initial
flavor
is
smooth
and
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
sweetness
quickly
fades
as
it
hits
the
sides
and
back
of
the
tongue
where
it
becomes
dry
and
crisp
the
ginger
is
present
from
start
to
finish
and
that
juicy
red
grapefruit
comes
through
perfectly
in
the
finish
its
light
bodied
and
so
juicy
but
it
isnt
a
sweet
fruit
beer
by
any
means
to
me
it
makes
a
perfect
substitute
for
juice
with
breakfast
or
as
a
refreshing
alternative
to
a
cider
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
unique
brew
that
serves
its
intended
purpose
perfectly
the
grapefruit
taste
isnt
too
overwhelming
it
combines
perfectly
with
the
hint
of
ginger
tastes
awful
served
it
at
a
beer
festival
and
waited
for
everyone
to
make
an
awful
face
we
called
it
red
bird
face
i
miss
this
seasonal
beer
and
i
love
the
citrus
flavor
that
is
hinted
at
with
the
grapefruit
in
all
a
pretty
average
drink
i
could
not
see
myself
doing
pitchers
of
this
even
on
a
hot
day
this
didnt
taste
it
as
beer
it
sure
tasted
as
a
ginger
beer
i
was
expecting
a
flavorful
grapefruit
apa
but
it
came
out
as
a
sugary
soda
drink
this
could
have
been
so
much
better
terrible
theres
more
ginger
in
this
beer
than
in
ginger
beers
i
have
had
the
grapefruit
adds
nothing
but
an
awful
foil
to
the
ginger
has
a
very
floral
and
fruity
note
to
it
appearance
is
clear
golden
as
expected
grapefruit
bitterness
once
you
taste
and
that
kinda
ruins
the
feel
i
know
some
folks
like
it
so
i
gave
it
a
decent
review
to
help
others
along
this
is
my
mowing
the
lawn
beer
or
admiring
the
lawn
after
i
pay
someone
else
to
do
it
its
freakin
hot
in
texas
easy
to
love
taste
palate
the
flavor
starts
with
a
light
grainy
base
malt
with
notes
of
ginger
and
mild
white
peppercorn
very
mild
notes
of
tart
grapefruit
like
citrus
move
in
and
lead
into
the
dry
snappy
finnish
hop
favor
seems
very
subdued
but
very
complimentary
to
the
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
and
it
definitely
adds
to
the
dryness
the
palate
feels
light
and
quite
lively
o
not
much
positive
to
say
i
expect
a
fruit
beer
to
distinctly
smell
like
the
fruit
its
brewed
with
not
the
case
here
also
even
without
real
red
grapefruit
its
so
easy
to
impart
grapefruit
flavor
in
a
beer
with
hops
finally
my
bottle
was
poorly
carbonated
a
great
session
or
nightcap
beer
really
light
and
refreshing
grapefruit
flavors
throughout
made
with
grapfruit
and
the
that
does
come
through
in
the
taste
this
is
n
excellent
summer
beer
goes
done
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
o
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
very
mild
kick
decent
variation
of
style
this
is
just
a
mediocre
beer
at
best
here
in
south
texas
where
today
the
heat
index
will
be
above
100
again
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
after
sweating
its
relatively
low
alcohol
4
75
so
you
can
drink
a
few
of
them
without
getting
too
intoxicated
it
is
a
very
dry
and
tart
beer
so
it
is
not
for
everyone
this
has
to
be
served
very
cold
i
have
not
yet
let
it
grow
warm
so
im
not
sure
what
it
would
taste
like
but
i
doubt
it
would
improve
with
a
higher
temperature
i
eat
grapefruit
often
so
i
love
this
beer
i
was
expecting
refreshing
and
light
it
was
light
and
there
were
some
interesting
flavors
brought
about
by
the
grapefruit
and
the
ginger
but
i
didnt
find
it
all
that
refreshing
a
quality
i
seek
in
a
brew
thats
billed
as
a
refreshing
summer
beer
if
it
needs
to
be
ice
cold
like
the
can
says
then
i
guess
thats
a
problem
for
me
i
like
a
good
ginger
ale
i
enjoy
grapefruit
very
much
im
not
overly
excited
by
this
particular
combination
for
refreshment
maybe
if
it
had
been
more
wheat
based
without
the
ginger
i
would
have
found
it
more
refreshing
overall
huh
well
how
about
that
when
i
sit
down
and
take
the
time
to
actually
take
a
look
at
this
beer
its
not
that
bad
refreshing
heck
yeah
i
could
be
wrong
but
im
not
sure
if
i
could
find
anything
more
refreshing
in
at
least
southeast
alaska
it
tastes
like
ginger
ale
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
juice
not
bad
for
someone
who
doesnt
really
like
that
hoppy
beer
taste
but
wants
something
summery
i
had
this
mid
july
with
chicken
wings
id
say
thats
the
best
pairing
for
this
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
refreshing
with
a
light
dinner
overall
definitely
a
unique
beer
it
is
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
something
i
would
buy
or
drink
regularly
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
i
love
grapefruit
and
its
my
favorite
out
of
all
of
the
various
citrus
fruits
it
would
have
been
nice
if
the
grapefruit
flavor
was
more
prominent
i
definitely
smell
grapefruit
but
i
get
more
ginger
flavor
than
anything
else
its
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
either
overall
very
refreshing
to
drink
and
not
too
sweet
either
when
i
first
had
this
three
years
ago
i
really
liked
it
now
not
so
much
it
appears
that
the
ginger
has
become
predominant
with
the
grapefruit
taking
a
lesser
role
its
still
ok
particularly
since
its
a
lawnmower
beer
i
can
also
detect
a
little
skunkiness
probably
thanks
to
wegmans
welllighted
cooler
it
loses
points
for
lack
of
head
and
lacing
and
for
the
skunkiness
i
guess
my
impression
of
this
was
to
be
a
radler
but
a
bit
more
beer
instead
this
never
appealed
to
me
the
color
and
appearance
was
thin
and
watery
as
was
the
feel
but
it
seemed
to
be
more
nothingness
the
taste
and
nose
are
acrid
and
saccharine
with
an
artificial
grapefruit
the
ginger
is
sour
and
earthy
very
vegetative
with
little
malt
not
my
favorite
ive
been
rapidly
tasting
craft
beers
for
a
few
years
and
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
summer
ale
grapefruit
is
fing
disgusting
but
i
was
completely
blown
away
by
this
fantastic
beer
very
crisp
light
enough
to
drink
a
ton
of
em
on
a
full
stomach
and
plenty
of
flavor
this
beer
is
not
sissy
although
it
is
light
reminds
me
of
water
skiing
the
beach
the
pool
and
grilled
food
gangsta
o
i
bought
one
of
these
out
of
a
singles
bin
and
then
went
back
for
a
twelvepack
really
well
done
and
more
interesting
than
a
lot
of
the
other
seasonals
o
its
good
if
you
like
drinking
ginger
ale
with
alcohol
i
wont
be
having
another
o
this
is
something
i
picked
up
in
a
cheap
make
your
own
six
pack
at
the
grocery
store
just
to
give
it
a
try
honestly
i
thought
it
was
just
a
summer
seasonal
from
shiner
and
didnt
see
the
grapefruit
and
ginger
part
of
the
label
and
probably
wouldnt
have
tried
it
if
i
had
im
actually
glad
i
did
dont
get
me
wrong
by
my
standards
this
isnt
beer
which
makes
rating
it
here
kind
of
difficult
but
i
gave
it
a
decent
rating
because
whatever
it
is
its
pretty
good
i
mentioned
reeds
ginger
beer
which
i
really
like
and
this
really
reminds
me
of
it
very
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
pretty
lite
beer
for
a
german
style
well
to
serve
the
yuppie
larvae
all
i
can
figure
need
some
good
barley
malted
ales
here
cut
back
on
the
rice
and
corn
malts
and
youll
have
a
winner
until
now
i
did
not
like
fruit
in
my
beer
i
may
have
to
rethink
that
o
i
was
expecting
strong
ginger
and
acidic
grapefruit
i
received
none
of
that
not
good
this
was
recommended
by
a
clerk
in
my
favorite
beer
store
when
another
customer
asked
about
it
it
sounded
appealing
because
grapefruit
and
ginger
are
favorites
and
im
open
to
trying
fruit
beers
i
bought
a
sixpack
to
try
and
what
a
disappoinment
i
like
ginger
a
lot
but
the
bitter
ginger
flavor
in
this
overpowered
all
other
flavors
i
tried
a
small
serving
again
with
friends
a
few
days
later
during
a
meal
and
it
was
slightly
better
with
food
others
thought
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
can
think
of
many
other
beers
id
rather
drink
as
an
afternoon
cooler
i
will
defintely
pass
on
this
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
this
beer
and
i
bought
some
and
it
is
actually
really
good
it
is
refreshing
and
has
a
fruity
taste
to
it
i
have
always
liked
shiner
beers
but
this
one
is
really
good
the
smell
to
it
is
not
that
bad
as
well
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
on
vacation
and
i
really
liked
it
i
am
hoping
that
i
can
find
some
here
at
home
shiner
made
a
good
summer
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
not
too
strong
of
a
taste
at
the
same
time
the
smell
is
actually
good
as
well
it
is
not
too
heavy
or
too
light
and
i
like
that
for
anyone
who
likes
shiner
beers
they
should
try
this
beer
not
a
huge
shiner
fan
but
i
love
this
beer
despite
that
most
reviews
here
are
not
favorable
its
a
specific
beer
for
a
specific
time
of
year
i
e
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
find
it
incredibly
light
and
refreshing
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summers
day
o
this
was
a
letdown
id
recently
had
harpoons
big
squeeze
which
is
a
shandy
with
grapefruit
juice
and
id
loved
it
but
this
is
billed
as
a
fruitvegetable
beer
so
i
guess
that
is
the
big
difference
anyways
not
a
fan
and
didnt
finish
it
cooked
with
it
instead
mouthfeel
was
light
with
low
carbonation
no
crispness
or
zing
overall
it
tastes
like
a
beer
with
a
shot
of
pink
grapefruit
added
the
ginger
was
in
the
background
mostly
with
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
finish
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
ginger
and
grapefruit
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
ginger
and
grapefruit
flavors
on
the
finish
however
when
the
beer
warms
up
the
flavors
turn
metallic
and
salty
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
earth
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
smells
like
a
solid
ginger
beer
soda
but
has
a
shift
in
flavors
that
make
it
hard
to
drink
when
it
warms
up
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
the
appearance
was
light
yellow
with
a
nice
head
sniffed
and
found
an
abundance
of
grapefruit
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
a
little
odd
with
a
quick
yet
intense
grapefruit
flavor
but
then
it
immediately
was
gone
and
overtaken
by
a
sweet
almost
molasses
flavor
that
tasted
like
breakfast
sausage
interesting
but
not
the
best
ive
tried
it
pours
light
to
medium
gold
with
a
grapefruit
citrus
hitting
you
in
the
face
the
hops
are
lacking
like
others
have
commented
the
key
here
is
the
grapefruit
and
effervescent
quality
so
if
your
looking
for
an
enjoyable
summer
beer
you
have
one
pours
a
amber
in
color
with
a
pinkish
hue
that
has
about
a
1finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
just
the
top
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
the
aroma
is
of
some
ginger
and
citrus
with
some
hops
the
taste
actually
has
a
lot
going
on
with
a
good
amount
of
ginger
mixed
with
various
hops
and
grapefruit
coming
through
strange
finish
as
it
tasty
a
bit
soapy
for
some
reason
lots
of
carbonation
as
is
noticed
by
the
small
streaming
bubbles
overall
it
is
different
and
isnt
bad
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
think
the
mention
of
any
hops
at
all
on
the
back
label
is
deceptive
advertising
either
fix
the
beer
with
more
hops
spoetzl
or
print
up
some
new
labels
that
promote
this
beer
for
what
it
really
is
a
grapefruitginger
beer
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
pinkish
hue
zero
head
upon
pour
looks
like
a
glass
of
fruit
juice
the
nose
feature
musty
grainy
notes
paired
with
notes
of
wheat
vegetal
notes
reminiscent
of
squash
no
real
discernible
grapefruit
the
taste
is
a
mess
it
starts
with
tart
citric
grapefruit
notes
which
are
undercut
by
strong
husky
grain
flavor
no
hops
to
speak
of
and
no
real
balance
between
flavors
mouthfeel
is
absent
of
appropriate
carbonation
all
i
get
is
a
bit
of
prickle
sensation
but
it
seems
out
of
place
overall
not
impressed
a
grapefruit
beer
with
citrus
hops
would
be
way
more
exciting
than
this
all
we
get
here
is
an
artificial
tasting
lackluster
brew
cant
really
think
of
much
grub
this
would
go
with
besides
fruit
perhaps
some
buttery
cheeses
perhaps
gudaedam
brie
may
be
okthough
probably
best
as
an
apertifcheers
peace2all
although
ruby
redbird
doesnt
appear
to
be
the
best
formulated
beer
by
any
means
its
odd
recipe
comes
together
in
much
the
same
way
that
creative
mixed
drinks
to
i
just
wish
that
the
spice
and
fruit
had
more
malt
support
too
much
rind
and
not
enough
grapefruit
flavor
although
that
would
be
unfavorable
too
the
body
and
taste
is
waterythin
plenty
of
citrus
yet
is
more
like
a
lager
than
a
radlershandy
i
do
enjoy
the
citrus
aspect
of
hops
and
like
grapefruit
which
is
showcased
in
this
beer
but
the
flavor
comes
from
the
fruit
and
not
the
hops
in
the
case
of
shiner
ruby
redbird
perhaps
as
a
pale
ale
with
grapefruit
the
beer
would
be
more
appealing
sure
this
was
a
session
beer
but
thats
only
assuming
that
more
than
one
would
be
had
in
a
sitting
for
me
i
could
have
a
few
at
a
time
but
its
easy
to
see
why
most
people
would
only
drink
one
of
these
before
moving
onto
something
else
theres
not
much
to
love
here
and
unless
youre
looking
to
kick
back
with
a
few
on
a
hot
afternoon
theres
not
much
to
take
away
from
this
this
was
pretty
much
a
textbook
example
of
what
a
summer
seasonal
should
be
atmosphere
is
okay
dark
amber
with
rising
effervescence
that
eventually
taps
out
very
slight
head
and
no
lacing
grains
with
lots
of
ginger
and
some
grapefruit
bitter
fruit
and
raw
ginger
overall
this
is
a
serviceable
quaff
for
a
beer
claiming
to
be
the
perfect
summer
beer
this
one
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
it
is
just
average
or
even
below
average
o
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
radler
than
anything
else
i
dont
think
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
another
reviewer
stated
it
reminds
me
of
fresca
combined
with
ginger
ale
more
than
it
does
a
beer
overall
done
in
by
no
head
sam
adams
summer
ale
still
the
summer
beer
of
choice
overall
look
if
the
idea
of
a
beer
with
considerable
grapefruit
and
ginger
flavors
sounds
uninviting
then
this
probably
isnt
your
best
option
for
me
as
someone
who
likes
ginger
and
grapefruit
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
while
acknowledging
that
its
not
complex
its
not
the
best
fruit
beer
out
there
but
if
you
happen
to
crave
both
beer
and
grapefruit
on
a
warm
day
and
are
looking
for
one
with
only
natural
flavors
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
overall
a
fair
summer
brew
the
grapefruit
doesnt
quite
shine
in
the
way
one
might
expect
from
the
labeling
but
its
presence
is
certainly
not
amiss
id
drink
this
again
if
offered
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
this
is
my
goto
summereveningoutdoors
beverage
this
really
is
the
perfect
summer
beer
i
found
myself
googling
the
2013
in
stores
date
in
the
winter
this
is
my
favorite
beer
and
if
you
have
not
had
it
yet
then
you
are
missing
out
most
bars
and
grocery
stores
have
it
available
from
march
september
so
pick
some
up
if
you
havent
already
the
flavor
has
a
slight
grapefruit
flavor
with
mild
tangy
citrus
tinge
and
light
rind
taste
with
some
mild
nuttiness
of
malt
again
it
seems
to
follow
the
nose
not
great
but
not
altogether
revolting
it
just
is
slight
grapefruit
soda
essence
comes
to
mind
but
not
sweet
and
not
really
bitter
either
the
overall
take
is
if
you
really
love
grapefruit
you
may
dig
this
but
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
than
a
serious
beer
with
grapefruit
added
m
light
bodied
o
to
me
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
situational
beerand
really
thats
all
you
can
expect
from
any
sort
of
seasonal
let
alone
a
summer
seasonal
i
found
the
beer
very
pleasant
for
a
hot
day
out
by
the
grillits
tart
and
refreshing
the
hint
of
spice
went
fine
with
our
meats
and
grilled
veggies
and
the
very
light
character
went
down
really
well
with
the
nice
bright
tartness
i
didnt
miss
the
hops
or
malt
one
bit
as
long
as
you
keep
your
beer
cold
the
experience
went
downhill
considerably
as
my
beer
warmed
up
its
a
great
light
choice
with
some
character
for
any
other
day
but
a
hot
summer
day
id
give
it
somewhere
in
the
high
2s
but
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
got
the
job
done
and
then
some
3
75
overall
refreshing
but
more
of
a
novelty
drinks
too
carbonated
like
a
soda
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
overall
while
it
tasted
fine
it
did
not
taste
like
beer
shiner
attempted
to
do
something
pretty
interesting
here
and
while
a
crisp
lager
with
notes
of
ginger
and
grapefruit
still
appeals
to
me
this
unfortunately
is
not
that
beer
overall
while
this
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
it
is
not
one
i
would
try
again
refreshing
i
guess
totally
onenote
works
like
an
alcoholic
ginger
ale
thats
pretty
more
much
it
overall
an
easydrinking
and
refreshing
hot
weather
beer
although
it
doesnt
taste
quite
like
a
traditional
beer
pours
a
lifeless
deep
gold
bordering
copper
no
head
or
retention
aroma
of
grated
citrus
peel
and
ginger
light
malts
in
the
flavor
twangy
ginger
yeast
and
sour
citrus
flaccid
bitterness
and
bone
dry
over
carbonated
too
much
grapefruit
not
enough
balance
unless
you
love
dry
grapefruit
juice
id
select
a
different
beer
than
this
rjt
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
that
falls
to
a
tiny
white
ring
that
eventually
fades
and
no
lacing
honey
gold
color
aroma
is
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
and
ginger
ale
flavor
is
a
burning
acidic
grapefruit
and
spicy
ginger
with
not
much
else
standing
out
mouthfeel
is
like
ginger
ale
with
a
slight
burning
sensation
and
not
like
beer
at
all
overall
whats
the
point
its
practically
alcopop
anyway
it
was
recommended
by
the
store
owner
but
perhaps
just
to
get
rid
of
it
o
not
a
horrible
beer
but
hardly
a
beer
at
the
same
time
tastes
like
someone
mixed
a
little
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
and
ginger
ale
and
called
it
good
good
summer
beer
i
guess
id
rather
an
apa
or
a
witbier
or
a
saison
myself
this
is
more
of
a
quasicraft
beer
imo
gateway
beer
not
horrifying
but
nothing
special
lots
of
fruit
with
a
citrus
edge
the
grapefruit
taste
is
distinct
without
being
very
bitter
actually
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
the
grapefruit
we
say
big
hop
ipas
taste
like
tangy
ginger
flavor
gives
this
a
spicy
touch
ginger
ale
lemonade
and
a
witbier
taste
thoroughly
drinkable
from
the
22
oz
botle
bought
at
depot
liquor
in
brownwood
texas
overall
i
will
not
have
this
again
o
perhaps
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
i
do
enjoy
grapefruit
juice
and
i
obviously
enjoy
beer
but
this
marriage
didnt
appeal
to
me
imagine
a
ginger
ale
shandy
but
drier
with
a
slice
of
grapefruit
wellbalanced
but
a
little
peculiar
certainly
refreshing
though
id
be
at
a
loss
what
to
pair
it
with
i
like
this
beer
a
good
bit
and
i
am
gonna
pick
up
some
more
of
it
its
a
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
while
messing
around
in
the
shed
in
the
back
yard
on
a
summer
day
pours
a
copper
ale
with
brilliant
clarity
and
no
foam
smells
like
sugar
some
grapefruit
way
too
sweet
some
pear
and
a
little
english
malt
pretty
unimpressed
so
far
tastes
like
a
hot
dog
with
some
artificial
sweetener
and
a
little
grapefruit
horrible
thin
with
moderate
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
that
is
a
shitty
beer
o
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
of
these
where
i
would
call
it
sessionable
overall
a
solid
enjoyable
summer
beer
probably
my
go
to
beer
for
the
summer
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
then
you
dont
like
summer
i
like
grapefruit
and
i
taste
it
some
ipa
so
when
i
saw
this
i
had
to
try
it
its
not
an
ipa
but
its
good
hard
to
describe
similar
to
a
weiss
bier
and
fruity
better
than
shiner
bock
low
alcohol
easy
to
drink
this
is
good
for
a
hot
humid
summer
night
i
just
with
the
abv
was
higher
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
far
superior
to
the
original
shiner
bock
and
with
a
well
executed
twist
of
creativity
that
i
find
just
right
for
warm
weather
sessioning
the
appearance
is
nothing
special
an
understated
pale
ale
color
with
a
moderate
but
rapidly
fading
white
head
and
very
little
visible
carbonation
the
nose
has
some
fresh
ginger
and
a
medium
american
malt
base
there
is
also
some
interesting
citrus
notes
coming
from
this
i
cant
yet
pick
it
out
as
grapefruit
but
it
absolutely
smells
thirst
quenching
the
flavor
is
sharp
sweet
red
tangy
grapefruit
right
up
front
really
fresh
and
tasty
with
the
ginger
taking
more
of
the
spotlight
towards
the
finish
a
very
refreshing
beer
indeed
only
mildly
acidic
from
the
grapefruit
and
very
very
light
in
body
with
dancing
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
on
the
boat
or
at
a
picnic
its
got
that
summery
vie
to
it
without
using
lemons
or
lager
yeast
or
any
of
the
usual
suspects
really
easily
the
best
diner
brew
ive
had
despite
its
mostly
negative
feedback
here
on
ba
ill
buy
this
again
did
i
mention
my
new
student
named
tawny
what
a
great
name
and
i
had
a
dense
finger
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
following
my
pour
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
amazing
i
caught
an
initial
whiff
of
grapefruit
but
then
the
ginger
suddenly
hit
me
in
the
sinus
cavity
i
actually
sneezed
in
surprise
i
am
all
for
truth
in
advertising
but
this
was
unexpected
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
it
was
abrasive
in
its
flavor
as
i
was
basking
in
the
ginger
on
the
tongue
i
still
think
that
clove
life
savers
were
the
best
i
ever
had
as
a
kid
and
this
reminded
me
of
one
of
them
the
tart
of
the
grapefruit
seemed
to
be
lost
until
the
swallow
and
its
incredibly
dry
finish
no
wonder
this
is
a
summer
beer
it
was
like
liquid
alum
my
throat
constricted
and
i
began
to
gasp
for
air
this
wasnt
dry
it
was
downright
arid
wow
i
definitely
want
one
at
a
more
appropriate
time
of
year
overall
id
say
this
one
isnt
as
enjoyable
as
id
hoped
it
be
nice
try
though
shiner
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mississipping
and
staywhatyouare2s
dad
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
tasting
recently
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
none
extremely
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
ginger
and
rice
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
ginger
wheat
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
bad
brew
i
was
wondering
why
their
dad
was
laughing
as
he
brought
this
one
out
from
the
garage
fridge
to
share
he
even
got
more
of
a
kick
when
i
went
to
smell
it
this
was
definitely
not
what
i
was
looking
for
when
i
came
to
this
tasting
the
ginger
on
this
one
was
what
made
it
so
bad
in
my
opinion
while
i
usually
like
ginger
this
one
presented
it
in
a
way
that
i
did
not
enjoy
at
all
definitely
would
make
a
rather
amusing
prank
on
someone
if
you
feel
the
urge
so
keep
that
in
mind
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
grapefruit
taste
is
tart
grapefruit
a
touch
of
malt
not
terrible
but
not
really
my
thing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
appearance
is
orange
and
brown
in
the
glass
soda
pop
carbonation
that
due
palates
hickory
to
nothing
mouthfeel
is
also
somewhat
flat
smell
is
not
remarkable
smells
like
an
ale
with
a
hint
of
citrus
grapefruit
is
present
on
the
taste
it
is
upfront
and
provides
a
semi
interesting
twist
to
this
beer
probably
its
best
feature
is
the
low
abv
and
sessionable
nature
best
for
a
hot
summer
day
served
real
cold
good
summer
sipper
this
is
my
own
bias
but
im
very
into
ginger
late
so
that
maybe
gives
it
an
extra
little
boost
for
me
right
now
halfsoda
halfbeer
pours
a
clear
golden
with
hints
of
orange
nonexistent
head
nice
pickled
ginger
aroma
taste
begins
with
a
big
blast
of
ginger
followed
by
a
bit
of
grapefruit
sweetness
after
that
is
a
little
bready
maltiness
very
clean
neutral
finish
not
bitter
at
all
despite
the
grapefruit
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
light
and
refreshing
let
me
start
off
by
saying
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
grapefruit
but
my
wife
is
so
my
review
of
this
has
this
as
a
starting
point
to
start
off
it
had
a
nice
looking
color
in
the
glass
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
you
can
definitely
smell
the
ginger
and
grapefruit
its
a
very
interesting
conversation
the
taste
is
an
interesting
mix
of
grapefruit
ginger
and
beer
i
cant
say
that
i
preferred
the
taste
but
my
wife
loved
it
odale
brewed
with
ginger
and
grapefruit
about
6
75
a
sixpack
i
guess
ill
give
her
a
shot
bad
idea
my
girlfriend
loved
it
because
it
tasted
so
much
like
ginger
ale
i
hated
it
for
the
same
reason
and
boy
when
this
beer
warmed
it
really
became
frightening
overall
drinkability
a
fruit
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
beer
all
in
all
my
favorite
summer
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
very
light
grain
and
a
little
citrus
but
not
that
strong
tastes
of
grain
with
citrus
flavoring
added
not
that
great
beer
is
very
smooth
with
its
light
body
but
has
a
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
very
average
beer
if
you
want
a
nicely
carbonated
summer
refresher
with
grapefruit
juice
and
ginger
that
has
some
beer
character
its
not
a
bad
choice
it
is
what
it
is
this
is
my
favorite
shiner
beer
but
i
also
do
like
and
drink
grapefruit
juice
as
well
despite
that
fact
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
about
beer
and
grapefruit
but
it
was
quite
good
the
amount
and
flavor
of
grapefruit
was
just
right
not
overbearing
but
enough
to
tell
without
knowing
the
name
what
fruit
was
included
will
definitely
buy
this
again
i
literally
almost
got
into
a
row
over
the
last
12
pack
last
fall
when
me
and
this
other
guy
came
into
the
store
at
the
same
time
panicked
that
it
was
almost
gone
we
lamented
that
this
beer
is
seasonal
it
was
enjoyable
seems
to
be
a
nice
compliment
to
texmex
or
other
spicy
foods
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
good
light
summer
beer
has
a
nice
grapefruit
undertones
nothing
spectacular
but
good
for
what
it
is
i
keep
it
out
by
the
pool
to
enjoy
on
hot
summer
days
in
houston
it
is
a
bit
thin
but
part
of
the
summer
beer
appeal
i
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
so
i
can
not
comment
on
color
or
head
pours
a
pretty
clear
slightly
reddish
amber
no
head
but
that
must
have
been
an
artifact
of
the
pour
malty
aroma
has
a
dusty
tone
like
powdered
fruit
drink
malty
flavor
has
a
fruity
undertone
apple
and
cherry
with
a
hint
of
pear
and
a
subtle
sour
undertone
texture
has
about
average
body
and
fizz
i
didnt
seem
to
get
any
grapefruit
but
this
is
a
tasty
and
distinctive
beer
let
it
fly
down
your
throat
i
poured
this
seriously
nasty
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
brew
and
im
calling
that
because
its
not
beer
was
slightly
redpinkish
and
poured
a
really
weak
head
it
smelled
like
coca
cola
believe
it
or
not
and
was
just
about
as
carbonated
tasting
the
taste
was
fruitysour
yuk
i
love
shiner
bock
but
ill
never
put
another
of
these
up
to
my
mouth
another
swing
and
miss
by
the
shiner
folks
not
something
id
want
to
drink
again
even
on
a
hot
day
as
the
bottle
suggests
no
character
o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
goes
best
with
hot
summer
days
mouthfeel
redbird
is
a
rather
thin
bodied
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
would
have
liked
a
lot
more
if
it
had
a
better
flavor
profile
this
is
a
rather
disappointing
beer
out
of
shiner
tx
overall
it
was
a
nice
change
and
decent
summer
brew
you
know
this
was
interesting
and
im
still
not
convinced
its
actually
a
beer
but
if
i
were
in
texas
and
it
was
like
120
degrees
out
i
bet
it
would
go
down
easy
maybe
im
feeling
charitable
or
i
just
like
ginger
ale
but
as
a
mindless
summer
beer
this
was
all
right
overall
this
was
a
good
light
thirst
quenching
summertime
beer
definitely
unique
with
the
gingergrapefruit
combo
wish
i
could
take
a
growler
of
this
to
the
pool
great
outdoorpatio
beer
this
was
more
of
a
ginger
beer
than
anything
i
wish
the
grapefruit
had
been
more
bold
probably
wont
have
again
low
c
overall
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
which
is
how
i
had
it
with
the
low
abv
and
easy
drinking
style
it
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
beer
shouldnt
taste
like
grapefruit
it
should
be
reclassified
as
cider
or
something
ill
never
drink
it
again
overall
an
ok
summer
beer
but
not
a
fan
of
lower
abv
brews
that
tiptoe
into
its
flavor
profile
overall
this
is
nice
for
a
oneoff
i
dont
think
id
ever
get
a
6pk
of
this
though
i
did
last
year
but
only
drank
half
even
though
its
probably
the
most
refreshing
beer
ive
ever
had
could
use
a
bit
more
definition
in
the
appearance
and
the
smelltaste
may
be
fine
where
it
is
its
pretty
subtle
for
a
grapefruit
beer
expected
it
to
be
in
your
face
overall
i
could
see
picking
up
a
six
pack
since
most
places
around
here
have
shiner
for
around
9
bucks
a
six
pack
not
a
bad
fruit
based
beer
at
all
overall
this
is
my
summer
beer
i
usually
do
the
shiner
102
or
hefeweizen
but
i
have
a
new
daily
drinker
basically
it
has
a
light
taste
of
ginger
fresh
grapefruit
lemongrass
and
other
citrus
characteristics
it
all
comes
together
perfectly
to
be
honest
with
yalllook
at
all
the
reviews
on
tap
not
many
huh
but
there
arent
any
bad
ones
where
as
the
bottle
has
horrible
reviews
mixed
in
with
ok
great
ones
scattered
around
sounds
like
with
the
bottle
of
this
beer
sometimes
there
is
too
much
carbonation
and
off
tap
that
problem
has
not
come
up
at
bombay
bar
i
have
a
32oz
bottle
of
this
in
my
fridge
right
now
but
im
leaving
this
review
for
the
tap
because
its
simply
better
and
every
connoisseur
knows
this
in
my
opinion
if
you
thought
it
tasted
like
bad
soda
then
i
recommend
you
look
up
a
bar
in
your
area
and
ask
if
they
have
it
on
tapguarantee
that
shit
wont
happen
to
you
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
light
clear
caramel
yellow
wtih
a
quickly
dissipating
fizzy
white
head
no
lacing
is
left
behind
the
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
are
plentiful
this
is
very
carbonated
it
reminded
me
of
pouring
a
soda
with
how
the
carbonation
rushed
out
of
it
the
aroma
is
very
faint
i
can
pick
up
some
ginger
though
its
pretty
faint
there
is
some
wheat
in
the
smell
as
well
for
being
a
grapefruit
flavored
beer
i
cant
really
pick
that
up
much
of
it
in
the
aroma
there
flavor
is
slightly
tart
from
the
grapefruit
and
spicy
from
the
ginger
the
flavors
of
the
wheat
malt
are
overpowered
here
the
grapefruit
isnt
as
forward
as
the
ginger
which
is
a
little
overpowering
the
excessive
carbonation
is
prickly
on
the
palate
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
as
noted
is
intense
what
should
be
an
easy
drinker
is
actually
very
difficult
to
consume
it
reminds
me
of
a
soda
in
many
ways
but
a
low
quality
one
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
plenty
of
other
breweries
have
produced
better
fruit
beer
that
embraces
the
fruit
while
not
betraying
the
beer
characteristics
shiner
gets
a
failing
grade
for
this
one
ginger
picks
up
in
intensity
with
the
flavor
of
ruby
redbird
spicy
crisp
and
pickled
grapefruit
is
an
afterthought
and
struggles
to
maintain
relevance
behind
a
drying
cereal
graininess
in
the
finish
a
bit
too
vegetal
for
my
liking
effervescent
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
clean
with
a
lingering
sharpness
from
the
ginger
root
overall
one
of
spoetzls
more
unique
offerings
definitely
worth
trying
if
only
for
the
novelty
overall
definitely
more
of
a
girl
beer
than
guy
light
and
simple
not
bad
but
i
prefer
the
traditional
bock
if
im
going
in
the
shiner
direction
oif
your
are
really
hot
and
thirsty
you
can
pound
these
like
water
good
beer
for
cutting
grass
the
fruity
taste
may
appeal
to
women
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
certainly
a
letdown
but
i
also
have
an
issue
with
the
appearance
it
has
very
little
carbonation
and
no
head
of
foam
making
it
look
more
like
a
glass
of
tea
than
a
serious
malt
beverage
this
coupled
with
the
lack
of
much
body
or
flavor
make
shiner
ruby
redbird
a
beer
to
avoid
o
a
flavorful
lower
abv
beer
that
may
appeal
to
those
who
like
ginger
and
dont
mind
a
rather
astringent
brew
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
smells
slightly
citrusy
maybe
some
of
the
grapefruit
coming
though
but
the
ginger
is
much
more
prominent
quite
light
overall
the
flavor
is
quite
heavy
on
the
ginger
perhaps
too
much
a
little
bit
of
citrus
too
quite
refreshing
actually
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
o
the
fact
this
beer
was
brewed
with
grapefruit
juice
and
ginger
really
jazzed
me
up
for
something
exciting
refreshing
delicious
summer
knockaround
brew
but
the
flavor
and
feel
were
pretty
lacking
unfortunately
refreshing
yeah
definitely
will
i
pick
up
some
more
sadly
no
a
hard
beer
to
getkeep
in
ft
lauderdale
with
good
reason
o
you
may
forget
your
drinking
a
beer
here
though
it
keeps
within
the
guidelines
low
malt
and
low
hop
profile
clean
yeast
with
a
forefront
of
the
fruitvegetable
highlighted
has
no
mention
of
alcohol
and
drinks
like
a
dream
if
you
are
a
fan
of
grapefruit
juice
of
which
i
am
labeled
as
a
great
summer
time
beverage
consumed
cold
on
a
hot
day
hell
i
will
go
as
far
to
say
this
is
the
ultimate
breakfast
beverage
as
you
may
not
be
able
to
tell
this
apart
from
virgin
grapefruit
juice
overall
as
a
beer
would
call
this
worthy
per
style
and
a
solid
good
rating
if
youre
a
fan
of
grapefruit
juice
not
very
impressed
with
this
outing
from
spoetzl
o
even
though
this
brew
has
a
verry
strange
flavor
i
liked
it
i
would
have
to
say
it
would
be
even
better
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
overall
this
beer
serves
its
purpose
well
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
for
grilling
out
o
im
kind
of
torn
on
how
to
wrap
this
up
when
i
break
it
apart
into
the
above
sections
nothing
really
stands
out
as
great
but
overall
i
thought
it
worked
in
a
weird
way
especially
when
this
beer
is
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
humid
summer
day
which
was
when
i
tried
it
sort
of
a
polarizing
beer
as
opinions
on
it
were
divided
right
down
the
middle
at
the
bbq
i
had
it
at
but
ill
definitely
pick
some
up
next
summer
to
give
it
another
shot
overall
interesting
not
bad
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
all
i
really
get
is
the
ginger
flavor
no
sweetness
or
anything
else
appealing
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
pours
a
clear
copper
color
15
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
ginger
pale
malt
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
fruit
vegetable
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
ginger
slight
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
and
hint
of
citrus
overall
sessionable
not
complex
and
almost
completely
a
ginger
beer
gets
off
to
an
unpromising
start
by
topping
its
orangish
golden
body
with
a
head
as
thin
and
short
lived
as
soda
fizz
aromas
are
subdued
to
the
point
of
barely
existing
i
get
a
whiff
of
something
like
sparkling
mineral
water
a
hint
a
citrus
and
light
grains
the
grapefruit
is
only
slightly
more
prominent
on
the
palate
has
flavors
of
light
nondescript
grains
with
a
few
drops
of
watery
fruit
punch
with
nothing
really
popping
or
asserting
its
presence
i
dont
detect
much
in
the
way
of
ginger
which
the
label
says
it
was
brewed
with
easily
my
least
favorite
of
the
shiner
lineup
o
not
a
great
effort
it
could
stand
to
be
more
flavorful
and
not
quite
as
cloying
overall
its
like
someone
combined
citrus
and
a
spicy
ginger
ale
if
there
is
a
beer
in
here
it
is
well
hidden
i
can
see
the
refreshing
aspect
to
this
beer
though
especially
when
the
beer
is
cold
and
crisp
definitely
would
wake
you
up
on
a
lethargic
summer
day
but
perfect
summer
beer
no
not
quite
interesting
to
try
but
i
cant
see
myself
deliberately
trying
it
again
edit
based
on
having
a
second
one
out
of
the
bottle
whilst
hot
and
sweaty
ive
adjusted
the
scores
slightly
not
good
but
a
bit
better
o
an
interesting
beer
if
not
a
good
one
i
didnt
mind
drinking
it
i
wouldnt
have
another
but
i
wouldnt
say
anything
against
ordering
one
a
very
easy
drinker
that
exceeded
my
expectations
going
down
good
on
a
cool
95
degree
oklahoma
evening
its
not
awful
its
at
least
different
from
most
light
tasteless
summer
beers
o
strangely
not
a
horrible
beer
im
thinking
i
got
a
bad
beer
here
the
tartness
of
the
grapefruit
was
a
little
different
from
most
fruit
beers
ive
had
o
after
a
couple
of
drinks
of
ruby
redbird
i
thought
to
myself
are
texans
really
drinking
this
shit
honestly
the
smell
of
freshly
grated
is
such
a
tease
when
you
follow
it
up
with
this
beer
gimmicky
onetrick
pony
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
which
dissipates
almost
instantly
no
lacing
what
so
ever
a
stream
of
carbonation
forms
in
the
middle
nothing
special
smells
are
of
ginger
with
hints
of
grapefruit
feel
is
very
light
but
perhaps
what
youd
expect
with
a
summer
beer
the
taste
is
light
of
ginger
with
a
little
bread
malts
with
a
grapefruit
after
taste
and
not
a
good
hoppy
grapefruit
but
a
rancid
rotten
one
which
i
hope
doesnt
linger
much
longer
yeah
its
a
summer
beer
pretty
light
and
maybe
easy
to
drink
dont
confuse
with
worthwhile
to
drink
but
not
at
all
to
my
taste
what
a
disappointment
considering
how
much
i
love
a
good
ginger
beer
the
non
alcoholic
stuff
the
taste
is
so
similar
to
the
smell
and
what
i
expected
after
taking
a
few
whiffs
ginger
takes
no
1
grapefruit
no
2
and
for
what
spoetzl
intended
or
at
least
what
i
think
they
intended
they
hit
the
nail
on
this
one
i
love
a
good
ginger
ale
ginger
beer
so
im
enjoying
sipping
and
drinking
this
4
01abv
concoction
i
guess
it
could
have
been
listed
as
one
of
them
there
malternatives
but
like
i
said
its
doing
okay
for
me
and
i
do
find
it
rather
refreshing
my
bucks
wasted
on
a
6
pack
nah
pours
dark
orangish
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
tart
with
a
noticeable
grapefruit
smell
but
not
overwhelming
the
taste
in
interesting
the
citrus
and
grapefruit
dominate
with
the
other
beer
qualities
taking
a
back
seat
the
flavors
are
not
as
expected
but
they
do
push
the
limits
of
fruit
beers
this
one
had
light
carbonation
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
i
do
not
think
i
would
buy
this
again
the
flavor
just
wasnt
refreshing
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
basic
malt
and
yeast
of
a
beer
are
often
lost
beneath
ginger
ale
elements
in
this
brew
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
problem
for
you
depending
upon
what
you
are
seeking
from
your
bottle
an
excellent
thirstquencher
with
nice
flavor
it
has
you
covered
a
craft
beer
umm
not
exactly
the
label
does
say
serve
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
fair
enough
mouth
is
bordering
thin
but
zippy
carbonation
makes
it
average
glad
i
tried
it
would
only
repeat
on
occasion
d
nope
this
was
a
decent
beer
it
had
a
strong
grapefruit
smell
which
is
to
be
expected
from
a
beer
that
hinges
the
flavor
profile
on
the
fruit
it
often
reminded
me
of
shiners
hefeweizen
but
that
may
have
been
due
to
the
citrus
notes
it
was
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
dont
really
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
of
it
not
great
not
bad
a
decent
beer
i
like
you
shiner
ruby
redbird
but
i
dont
love
you
good
mouth
feel
if
not
a
little
fizzy
right
better
try
a
second
to
be
absolutely
sure
this
is
a
confusing
beer
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
just
tastes
out
of
balance
if
they
tweaked
the
recipe
a
bit
they
might
be
on
to
something
for
summertime
concept
fruit
beers
id
go
with
21st
amendment
hell
or
high
watermelon
or
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
this
is
not
a
repeat
buy
for
me
even
though
i
give
them
credit
for
creativity
o
thankfully
this
was
a
freebie
there
are
just
so
many
good
summer
beers
im
not
sad
that
this
one
is
available
in
a
store
near
me
avoid
okay
and
great
to
drink
in
the
summer
not
much
of
a
beer
though
more
of
a
flavored
malt
beverage
presentation
packaged
n
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsenerr
glass
its
very
refreshing
but
it
barely
feels
like
im
drinking
a
beer
i
think
i
could
get
something
very
similar
by
mixing
ginger
ale
and
grapefruit
juice
its
very
refreshing
and
good
for
the
summertime
heat
but
it
needs
to
look
and
feel
like
a
beer
drinkability
these
are
good
i
think
pounding
through
them
shortcircuits
the
mild
but
interesting
flavors
yet
they
are
easy
to
drink
down
toasting
this
one
to
my
inlaws
down
in
katy
dodging
firestorms
tonight
be
safe
folks
and
to
all
my
lone
star
pals
down
there
too
safe
home
i
sampled
this
beer
fairly
warm
and
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
icecold
on
a
sunny
day
while
cooking
outdoors
the
cold
might
make
it
seem
a
little
more
spicy
and
gingery
and
it
would
cover
up
the
malt
a
bit
more
its
almost
not
a
beer
but
ok
its
at
least
refreshing
and
a
touch
interesting
its
not
a
beer
that
id
immediately
reach
for
or
buy
again
but
i
can
think
of
quite
a
few
mainstream
american
lagers
andor
light
beers
that
id
pass
over
for
this
one
im
not
sure
i
can
give
this
one
a
worth
trying
nothing
special
try
it
if
you
like
grapefruit

this
is
what
shiner
replaced
their
smokehaus
rip
beer
with
smells
quite
a
bit
like
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
ginger
i
disagree
with
other
reviewers
on
here
that
say
the
ginger
is
overpowering
as
a
matter
of
fact
put
it
in
a
can
so
ill
bypass
that
headache
me
but
this
is
another
forgettable
beer
from
the

brewery
in

ive
never
had
a
grapefruit
beer
before
the
concept
is
interesting
did
shiner
deliver
certainly
in
flavor
some
areas
were
lacking
imo
that
is
for
sure
more
depth
than
a
ginger
beer
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
do
love
ginger
ale
since
it
should
be
noted
ive
never
tried
bl
lime
i
was
hoping
for
a
light
but
i
dont
like
ginger
what
the
hell
is
going
on
this
is
fantastic
all
i
can
do
is
picture
cases
of
this
anyone
the
bottle
brags
that
its
the
perfect
summer
beer
and
it
might
be
right
i
think
it
would
also
pair
pretty
well
with
asian
or
asian
fusion
dishes
it
would
be
especially
good
with
sushi
im
sure
a
lot
of
beeradvocate
users
are
going
to
give
this
beer
poor
reviews
why
does
it
not
reek
of
hops
would
for
sure
drink
this
again
o
the
raspberry
is
not
as
intense
and
could
use
something
tart
to
poke
it
up
a
bit
this
was
an
okay
beer
probably
nothing
i
would
buy
again
unless
i
was
really
craving
a
raspberry
beer
for
some
reason
and
had
no
access
to
some
founders
rubaeus
my
girlfriend
digs
the
raspberry
ales
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
i
find
fruit
beers
at
their
most
desirable
on
a
very
hot
day
today
is
not
one
of
those
days
not
a
very
good
beer
can
smell
some
raspberry
but
barely
comes
through
at
all
as
far
as
taste
goes
horrid
aftertaste
gets
slightly
more
bearable
as
you
drink
it
definitely
not
worth
purchasing
maybe
worth
a
try
if
a
buddys
offering
it
for
free
booo
this
beer
if
you
can
call
it
beer
booo
boooo
boooooo
by
itself
this
was
very
raspberry
everything
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
and
a
bit
cloying
and
sweet
this
might
be
sacrilege
but
i
mixed
this
with
a
homebrewed
stout
very
standard
and
straightforward
bit
roasty
generally
balanced
and
the
resulting
mix
was
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
about
2
parts
stout
to
1
part
hd
raspberry
this
beer
does
have
a
place
but
imho
it
is
not
standing
solo
would
buy
for
this
purpose
p
s
corn
syrup
will
mix
much
quicker
than
sugar
cheers
light
orange
body
with
a
good
frothy
head
aroma
of
sweet
berries
slightly
bitter
taste
with
a
bunch
of
raspberry
flavor
i
like
it
thought
it
would
be
better
than
this
strong
dislike
this
beer
is
not
too
sweet
it
has
a
nice
after
taste
and
pairs
well
with
foods
more
commonly
combined
with
wine
it
is
also
good
with
heartier
foods
such
as
bacon
wrapped
dates
and
pretzel
puffs
with
beer
cheese
sauce
will
buy
to
serve
at
summer
gatherings
at
home
overall
for
a
fruit
inspired
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
however
it
can
get
old
and
seem
redundant
after
a
whilethe
sweetness
becomes
slightly
overwhelming
but
for
every
once
in
a
while
its
a
great
option
poured
from
a
bottle
has
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
the
aroma
is
faintly
raspberry
and
this
is
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
the
flavor
has
hardly
any
raspberry
but
more
of
a
wheat
even
then
there
isnt
much
carbonation
is
low
to
nothing
and
the
beer
leans
on
the
watery
side
unfortunately
this
just
isnt
a
very
good
beer
and
i
happen
to
like
fruit
beers
i
like
this
raspberry
ale
because
it
has
more
of
a
malt
base
than
just
white
wheat
and
while
the
berry
doesnt
come
through
and
blow
your
mind
and
it
doesnt
stand
out
really
in
any
way
its
important
to
remember
that
this
is
good
because
its
different
innovation
pays
at
least
for
me
hazy
almost
amber
copper
color
to
this
minimal
white
head
and
a
pink
tint
the
nose
mixes
sweet
and
tartness
of
the
berry
with
a
sweeter
and
larger
malt
profile
than
usual
for
a
fruit
beer
which
to
me
is
this
beers
most
redeeming
asset
the
taste
has
a
surprising
amount
of
front
of
flavor
hops
to
it
before
the
fruit
flashes
in
and
then
the
malt
finishes
it
an
odd
flavor
journey
really
filling
for
the
style
and
without
a
ton
of
real
raspberry
in
the
taste
i
do
like
the
mix
of
richer
grain
and
fruit
fuller
bodied
and
rather
poorly
carbonated
but
a
cool
beer
nevertheless
overall
a
decent
fruit
beer
it
reminds
me
of
my
own
homebrew
take
on
a
lighter
ale
with
fruit
raspberry
is
one
to
use
to
get
the
flavor
to
come
through
the
beer
also
helps
to
keep
the
malthop
profile
subdued
12oz
bottle
nearly
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
lighter
than
expected
drying
finish
faintly
warming
though
at
best
a
decent
brew
nothing
worth
searching
out
raspberry
ale
pours
a
hazy
reddish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
the
aroma
is
weak
but
raspberries
are
present
the
taste
has
a
nice
crisp
malty
backbone
with
wheat
like
flavors
mixed
in
and
raspberry
flavors
on
top
very
drinkable
nice
flavors
nothing
overpowers
overall
a
very
nice
mellow
fruit
beer
o
definite
step
up
from
shock
top
but
if
i
want
a
fruit
beer
ill
turn
to
new
galrus
my
advice
is
to
only
get
this
if
it
is
very
hot
outside
to
quench
your
thirst
at
only
5
abv
the
main
problem
with
fruit
beers
is
that
often
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
fruit
being
employed
is
simply
too
strong
drowning
out
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
malt
hops
and
other
beer
ingredients
well
here
comes
a
beer
that
is
quite
light
on
the
raspberry
in
both
scent
and
taste
the
only
problem
is
that
it
really
doesnt
have
much
else
to
take
its
place
yes
youll
taste
some
malt
and
hops
and
mostly
bread
and
yeast
and
nothing
is
the
least
bit
offensive
but
you
wont
be
blown
away
by
anything
this
is
a
forgettable
beer
one
that
avoids
being
overpowering
but
that
doesnt
have
anything
to
be
memorable
in
the
least
no
its
not
too
sweet
or
too
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
great
as
the
thickness
is
right
where
i
wanted
it
to
be
and
the
carbonation
is
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
while
not
distracting
from
the
flavor
but
the
flavor
itself
just
isnt
enough
instead
consider
thirsty
dogs
raspberry
beer
if
you
can
find
it
dark
horses
beer
just
simply
doesnt
try
hard
enough
or
maybe
we
should
celebrate
a
beer
that
doesnt
surrender
to
fruit
flavors
and
aims
to
be
a
bit
more
mild
i
just
dont
know
but
i
do
know
that
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
again
o
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
though
i
feel
im
being
a
bit
generous
in
my
assessment
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
or
an
american
blonde
ale
than
a
fruit
beer
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
i
would
not
turn
it
down
on
a
hot
day
but
i
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
again
though
this
beer
is
well
worth
trying
once
there
are
far
better
fruit
beers
on
the
market
lightly
revised
in
august
2013
following
a
on
tap
tasting
eh
definitely
not
the
worst
fruit
infused
beer
out
there
but
miles
from
being
near
the
top
too
the
raspberry
isnt
as
strong
nor
as
pure
as
it
should
be
overall
a
little
boring
and
uneventful
and
the
flavors
that
are
taking
place
arent
the
best
around
might
be
good
for
people
who
are
easing
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
but
theyll
soon
be
leaving
this
one
behind
them

the
overcarbonation
here
really
impacts
the
overall
experience
of
the
beer
the
bubbles
on
the
palate
confuse
the
taste
buds
and
cover
up
some
of
the
flavor
it
also
makes
the
flavors
that
do
come
through
seem
fleeting
i
think
it
achieves
what
it
set
out
to
do
it
is
refreshing
its
fruity
without
being
over
the
top
and
its
light
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
unfortunately
im
unimpressed
this
isnt
a
beer
id
like
to
have
again
o
like
i
said
my
staple
goto
enough
flavor
that
you
are
actually
tasting
something
but
light
and
easy
enough
to
just
kick
back
and
relax
with
this
pours
a
semicloudy
copper
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
the
scent
is
mostly
wheat
with
some
hints
raspberries
the
taste
has
more
raspberry
flavor
to
it
than
you
would
expect
from
the
color
and
aroma
there
is
a
rush
of
sweet
raspberry
flavor
that
then
turns
into
a
strong
wheat
flavor
before
finishing
kind
of
dry
and
chalky
this
is
a
slight
step
up
from
shocktop
raspberry
but
still
has
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
o
refreshing
but
being
a
fan
of
raspberries
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
other
than
the
faint
scent
there
isnt
any
real
raspberry
character
to
this
brew
tastefeel
unfortunately
i
didnt
get
to
completely
enjoy
my
beer
because
my
friends
were
pushing
me
out
the
door
to
the
casino
but
i
got
a
few
sips
in
where
i
could
think
if
i
liked
it
or
not
and
i
do
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
this
beer
just
doesnt
blow
me
away
like
i
thought
it
might
sure
you
get
the
raspberries
but
i
couldnt
help
but
feel
meh
about
it
its
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
super
appropriate
for
spring
or
summer
though
and
id
try
another
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottle
dating
pours
lightly
hazy
golden

earth
lingering
notes
of
toast
biscuit
raspberry
herbal
floral
and
earth
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
not
nearly
as
much
raspberry
in
the
taste
as
i
expected
from
the
aromas
mostly
biscuit
and
herbal
hops
minimal
cloying
flavors
on
the
finish
and
fairly
dry
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
syrupy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
pretty
much
no
warming
on
the
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
seriously
lacking
in
the
fruit
department
in
the
taste
was
very
easy
to
drink
o
good
beer
for
style
refreshing
im
not
sure
how
they
brew
this
but
it
drinks
like
a
raspberry
wheat
beer
its
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
i
rather
enjoy
the
authentic
fruit
flavors
of
the
beer
but
the
lack
of
balance
from
hops
dryness
or
acidity
limits
its
drinkability
for
the
staunch
beer
enthusiast
this
beer
may
not
cut
it
but
hey
chicks
dig
it
owas
expecting
more
raspberries
are
yummy
and
sweet
while
this
beer
was
leaning
artificial
and
semisweet
overall
impression
a
decent
fruit
beer
by
dark
horse
but
expected
much
more
from
these
guys
it
could
have
been
an
outdated
brew
but
who
knows
without
the
b
o
d
average
when
it
comes
down
to
it
overall
if
your
seeking
a
naturally
flavored
but
put
the
beer
first
fruit
beer
this
is
what
youd
want
to
try
pretty
good
id
drink
another
one
even
though
fruit
beers
arent
really
my
balliwick
overall
this
beer
is
ok
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
though
o
a
good
fruit
beer
it
replaces
hops
flavor
and
bitterness
with
the
sharp
tart
and
fruity
flavors
from
the
raspberries
i
would
consider
this
a
lambic
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
this
beer
is
another
beer
that
will
work
well
when
chilled
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
body
faintly
syrupy
at
times
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
good
carbo
depth
though
my
standard
for
raspberry
ales
is
of
course
ngs
raspb
tart
so
i
expected
a
wallop
of
fruit
all
over
this
that
i
did
not
get
what
was
there
instead
was
a
decent
beer
with
all
of
it
malty
goodness
grains
light
bitterness
and
then
a
decent
zip
of
fruity
tartness
on
the
finish
huh
this
wasnt
what
i
anticipated
but
it
held
its
own
nonetheless
i
like
that
the
fruit
character
is
more
muted
than
inyourface
plus
my
wife
loved
it
i
cant
drink
this
kind
of
a
fruit
beer
too
fast
its
interesting
enough
i
guess
a
regrettable
order
at
the
bar
3
0
the
ale
sort
of
tastes
like
a
light
nationally
branded
beer
ex
bud
miller
etc
with
a
faint
raspberry
taste
tasteless
really
minus
the
raspberries
overall
gives
to
a
fruit
pie
component
with
a
lingering
crusty
finish
first
whiffs
and
impressions
though
are
not
that
impressive
mixing
with
an
appearance
that
is
less
than
satisfying
no
major
complaints
but
no
raves
either
here
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
warmer
weather
beer
the
low
alcohol
makes
it
a
great
summer
session
beer
o
overall
i
was
looking
for
a
nice
raspberry
beer
this
was
raspberry
alright
but
kind
of
gross
too
thick
and
chewy
although
i
was
able
to
get
through
a
small
glass
of
it
i
opted
to
move
onto
something
else
and
didnt
finish
it
this
one
is
not
for
me
there
are
plenty
of
tasty
raspberry
beers
out
there
so
i
dont
see
why
youd
go
for
this
one
2
5
d
not
even
close
to
the
worst
of
the
fruit
beers
but
still
not
good
i
doubt
my
gender
is
the
target
buyer
for
this
i
like
how
natural
and
tangy
the
raspberry
is
but
the
farm
house
ale
taste
doesnt
jive
well
with
the
fruit
the
pervasive
fruit
separates
itself
from
the
more
natural
beer
taste
and
just
doesnt
blend
its
still
very
easy
drinking
and
unique
overall
i
was
looking
for
more
raspberrys
but
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
regardless
overall
i
dont
expect
that
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
but
by
no
means
would
i
recommend
people
to
pass
it
by
without
trying
o
very
nice
crowd
pleasing
spring
festival
concert
going
beer
o
provided
you
can
get
past
the
finish
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
cherries
and
hints
of
woody
notes
spices
of
all
kind
blended
in
rich
as
all
hell
this
was
more
of
a
cherry
ale
then
a
stout
but
superb
a
rich
tart
and
yet
sweet
cherry
notes
peppery
and
loaded
with
spice
such
complexityrichness
this
was
indeed
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
smooth
light
body
with
a
nice
carbonation
that
was
great
for
an
ale
but
light
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
shows
marginal
retention
smells
of
raspberries
and
faint
bready
malt
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
distinct
tartness
that
i
assume
is
from
the
berries
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
tart
raspberries
and
a
hint
of
belgian
yeasty
esters
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
with
a
slick
almost
sweet
mouthfeel
this
one
was
kind
of
meh
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
bottle
had
been
sitting
for
a
while
before
i
purchased
it
o
honestly
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
not
fruit
soda
like
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
this
is
more
tart
and
doesnt
taste
like
they
just
dumped
a
lot
of
raspberry
syrup
into
it
otherwise
not
bad
just
simple
and
straightforward
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
dark
horse
uses
real
michigan
raspberries
and
you
can
tell
in
the
taste
a
very
fresh
raspberry
taste
which
also
tastes
like
a
beer
and
not
just
an
artificially
flavored
we
made
this
for
you
girlfriend
kind
of
thing
getting
this
mixed
with
the
black
bier
is
also
wonderful
o
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
i
am
not
huge
on
the
style
but
this
is
worth
trying
it
was
enjoyable
o
generally
dark
horse
really
impresses
me
this
however
is
just
an
average
representation
of
the
style
from
other
tastings
ive
had
from
this
category
i
can
say
im
glad
ive
had
it
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
within
this
style
though
this
is
a
fruity
one
would
drink
again
though
only
ifi
were
in
the
mood
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
this
one
has
a
dominant
raspberry
smell
with
many
sweet
characteristics
and
some
subtle
malt
presence
the
overall
smell
isnt
as
strong
as
expected
the
taste
is
all
raspberry
from
beginning
to
end
the
flavor
isnt
sweet
it
starts
out
tart
with
the
raspberry
up
front
finishes
with
a
koolaid
like
taste
this
one
is
a
light
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
not
the
best
for
the
style
the
raspberry
didnt
feel
like
if
fit
the
beer
well
overall
a
solidly
good
beer
nothing
outstanding
about
it
but
if
you
are
into
the
fruit
beer
its
absolutely
worth
a
try
pours
reddish
golden
huge
head
that
lingers
nice
lacing
smell
dude
wheres
the
raspberry
just
yeasty
here
slightest
fruitiness
to
it
but
come
on
same
with
the
taste
maybe
the
slightest
bit
of
spritzerish
raspberry
to
it
but
once
again
come
on
just
yeasty
mouthfeel
is
decent
slightly
carbonated
and
creamy
i
opened
this
before
i
sent
it
as
an
extra
and
im
glad
i
did
for
fear
of
embarassment
just
not
very
good
not
bad
just
not
good
nothing
like
i
would
expect
a
dark
horse
brew
to
be
just
no
raspberry
at
all
avoid
this
one
overall
not
a
very
exciting
fruit
beer
the
raspberries
taste
way
too
fake
id
choose
a
different
fruit
beer
over
this
one
o
i
dont
really
have
a
strong
opinion
on
this
beer
either
good
or
bad
not
bad
but
nothing
memorable
either
this
is
a
very
tasty
fruit
beer
not
amazing
but
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
random
pick
to
fill
my
mixed
sixer
today
yeah
im
honest
like
that
it
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
strawamber
topped
by
a
healthy
finger
or
two
of
dusty
lightcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
stale
raspberries
wheat
corn
flowers
and
a
hint
of
blueberries
the
headliner
berries
may
come
off
as
stale
but
the
smell
isnt
yet
objectionable
just
not
thoroughly
fresh
the
taste
holds
notes
of
medicinal
and
artificial
raspberry
dehydrated
strawberry
like
the
kind
youd
find
in
special
k
and
other
such
cereals
toffee
musty
wheat
lemon
rind
and
a
touch
of
weak
clove
okay
it
kinda
starts
off
fine
but
devolves
quickly
into
tongue
pain
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
and
kinda
grainy
feel
overall
another
failure
at
making
a
palatable
raspberryinfused
beer
why
is
this
so
damn
hard
asks
the
homebrewer
who
has
failed
all
sorts
of
times
before
a
very
good
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
want
something
a
little
different
drank
6
ozs
and
drain
poured
the
rest
i
think
more
tart
raspberry
flavors
would
improve
this
one
on
a
positive
note
the
alcohol
seemed
non
existent
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
hazy
golden
colored
ale
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
head
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
really
the
smell
is
sweet
with
raspberry
aromas
billowing
from
the
glass
the
taste
wasnt
as
strong
with
fruit
as
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
from
the
smell
the
taste
was
on
the
lighter
side
that
left
a
dry
fruity
malt
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
bad
here
there
was
a
decent
carbonation
and
was
rather
refreshing
this
was
good
but
not
my
favorite
raspberry
ale
overall
it
was
a
nice
beer
and
refreshing
to
drink
i
cant
say
id
get
it
again
but
it
was
a
good
intro
to
a
different
style
pretty
murky
darkergolden
brew
with
a
fairly
small
bubbly
white
head
nose
is
sweet
malt
and
some
berries
raspberries
that
is
pretty
similar
with
the
taste
sweet
malt
front
biscuit
maybe
a
touch
of
grass
lawn
not
the
flower
some
raspberry
thats
pretty
well
blended
medium
bodied
pretty
wet
with
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
i
think
in
their
effort
to
blend
everyhing
the
beer
becomes
slightly
muted
but
overall
its
certainly
not
bad
o
its
a
nice
fruit
beer
but
the
fruit
just
isnt
in
your
face
enough
to
really
make
this
worth
while
its
tasty
sure
but
kinda
the
equivalent
of
a
fruit
seltzer
with
some
alcohol
pours
a
murky
tanred
with
very
slight
carbonation
little
lacing
smell
is
distinctly
berry
with
raspberry
notes
dominating
but
slight
notes
of
strawberry
and
blackberry
also
present
some
sweet
malt
notes
in
the
nose
but
very
faint
taste
is
mild
raspberry
with
more
pale
and
caramel
malts
coming
through
overall
the
taste
is
very
mild
in
all
respects

is
thin
and
carbonation
light
i
could
see
this
being
a
real
crowd
please
with
people
who
light

fruit
beers

while
i
did
enjoy
it
i
do
not

myself
buying
one
again
pours
out
a
dark
orange
body
with
a
nice
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
carbonation
is
good
on
this
one
the
nose
is
very
strong
in
raspberries
with
some
wheat
and
other
grains
in
the
back
the
taste
has
a
tartiness
from
raspberries
and
a
wheat
taste
in
the
back
that
gives
it
a
very
nice
balance
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
but
than
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
makes
you
wanna
drink
more
liquids
to
take
away
the
dryness
this
is
a
good
fruitvegetable
beer
to
go
for
when
in
the
mood
for
one
this
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
with
a
body
that
reminds
mr
of
an
adjunct
lager
very
carbonated
overall
i
could
see
why
i
didnt
grab
another
and
basically
it
was
good
marketing
to
have
a
cool
looking
label
to
get
me
to
buy
it

of
the
more
forgettable
offerings

this

would
it
would
be

pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
thick
two

soapy
head
which
gives
way
to
minimal
lace
if
any
the
aroma
is
of
sweetness
and
raspberry
tartness
along
with
wheat
the
aroma
is
faint
the
taste
is
of
wheat
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
raspberry
tartness
refreshing
but
slightly
artificial
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
and
stingy
overall
the
beer
is
okay
the
flaws
could
be
hidden
in
the
first
beer
it
is
a
very
easy
drink
but
the
taste
is
just
average
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
amber
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal

the
aroma
is
of
raspberries
with
a
faint
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
milder
the
aftertaste
is
of
strong
nasty
artificial
sweeteners
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation

i
will
pass
on
this
beer

time

d
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in

trade
so
no
harm
done
to
my
wallet
the
flavor
is
awful
and
i
would
never

this
again

this
is
one
of
those
i

this

would

by
no

i

i
must
say

is
low

the

not
overly
sweet
or
tart
but
somewhere
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
not
what
id
like
it
to
be
it
was
a
little
too
smooth
i
wouldve
preferred
more
carbonation
and
greater
crispness
i
found
this
raspberry
ale
to
be
pretty
tasty
and
i
enjoyed
it
id
say
that
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
but
i
love
most
raspberry
beers
d
decent
but
when
it
comes
to
fruit
beers
this
one
falls
short
still
enjoyed
it
though
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
decent
it
shows
some
nice
raspberry
flavors
to
it
it
was
pretty
easy
drinking
and
i
can
see
a
lot
of
casual
drinkers
liking
this
beer
it
wasnt
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
but
it
was
definitely
above
average
just
based
on
not
having
a
huge
extract
flavor
to
it
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
for
myself
again
but
my
girlfriend
would
definitely
buy
it
for
herself

it

heavy

it
is
pure
raspberries

is
also
some
acidity

t
like
the

the
palate
has
a
considerable
amount
of
raspberry
i
also
perceive
a
decent
kick
of
hops
which
provide
a
citrus
and
earthy
punch
individually
i
enjoy
the
two
tastes
but
them
seem
to
clash
somewhat
in
the
beer
quite
dry

overall
dark
horse
makes
good
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
while
playing
some
disc
golf
in
the
summer
heat
i
would
for
sure
pick
this
beer
up
again
db
a
decent
beer
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
from
this
one
the
good
aroma
led
me
to
think
this
would
taste
like
fresh
alcoholic
raspberries
unfortunately
the
fruit
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
refreshing
average
beer
for
a
decent
price
pretty
decent
drinkability
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
by
far
my
least
favorite
offering
from
the
good
people
at
dark
horse
f
well
at
least
its
a
clean
on
the
finish
light
and
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
day
but
slightly
watery
and
lingering
little
raspberry
and
malt
extract
syrup
d
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
if
you
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
raspberries
then
this
would
hit
the
spot
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
but
it
isnt
a
must
have
by
any
means
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
barely
translucent
dark
honeygolden
brown
aroma
is
malty
with
a
strong
overtone
of
raspberry
which
i
love
flavor
is
malty
and
a
bit
hoppy
again
with
a
firm
raspberry
overtone
just
a
teensy
bit
on
the
thin
side
texture
is
smooth
fairly
fizzy
and
just
a
bit
watery
definitely
worth
a
try
strong
raspberry
sournessvery
tart
particularly
in
the
swallow
which
leaves
a
lasting
aftertaste
rich
body
with
a
generous
level
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
and
refreshing
i
liked
the
level
of
carb
eh
overall
this
was
just
decent
at
best
and
i
dont
think
the
crossover
potential
exists
since
the
raspberry
is
so
subdued
i
also
sampled
their
blueberry
stout
and
was
suprised
how
messy
the
flavors
were
dark
horses
fruit
beers
leave
much
to
be
desired
drinkabilityan
ok
fruit
beer
where
the
raspberries
are
tart
but
not
overpowering
not
as
good
as
other
dark
horse
beers
i
would
pass
on
this
pours
a
murky
gold

blush
pinkpurple
with
minimal
off
white
head
smell
is
of
sweet
and
tar
raspberrys
freshly
dried

taste
is
of
mild
pale
malt
wheat
and
just
a
touch
of
sweet
raspberry
lacks
tartness
and
agressiveness
ends
up
feeling
muddled
and
dirty
light
to
medium
bodied
over
carbonated
a
rapberry
beer
without
any
punch
drinkability
simple
but
tasty
and
refreshing
for
a
fruit
beer
which
i
often
abhor
it
is
quite
impressive
drinks
ok
at
best
has
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
of
a
watereddown
fruit
juice
with
just
enough
beer
characteristics
to
be
a
putoff
for
nonbeer
drinkers
though
i
am
not
a
fruit
beer
lover
and
there
are
worse
in
the
style
as
well
d
not
bad
overall
for
drinkability
reminds
me
a
bit
of
rubaeus
but
not
done
quite
as
well
enjoyablebut
im
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
one
again
too
many
other
great
raspberry
beers
around
to
stay
on
this
one
d
the
higher
carbonation
with
fruit
flavor
is
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
see
having
two
or
three
d
unlike
a
lot
of
other
fruit
beers
this
one
isnt
so
sweet
to
the
point
where
you
dont
want
another
very
clean
and
refresing
great
grass
cutting
summer
beer
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
perfect
during
the
summertime
i
think
dark
horse
pretty
much
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
beer
good
job
guys
perfect
beer
for
people
who
like
fruity
beers
o
the
fact
that
this
still
tastes
like
a
beer
rather
than
smirnoff
ice
puts
it
in
a
category
of
fruit
beers
those
of
us
that
dont
really
care
for
fruit
beers
this
beer
pleases
me
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
an
interesting
combination
and
is
not
overdone
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
pints
in
a
sitting
a
bit
expensive
for
what
you
get
though
a
fruit
beer
that
just
misses
the
raspberry
is
very
subtle
in
taste
and
not
there
at
all
in
smelll
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
grimy
the
aftertaste
just
flatout
reminds
me
of
medicine
i
wanted
this
beer
to
be
a
good
one
because
i
love
raspberries
but
i
was
not
excited
about
this
one
dark
horse
makes
other
beers
that
are
much
better
than
this
and
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
someone
who
wants
a
fruity
beer
reddish
copper
in
color
about
a
twofinger
dense
head
that
retreats
kind
of
quickly
leaving
nothing
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
sweet
and
tart
like
well
raspberries
yeasty
as
well
not
much
of
anything
else
but
i
like
to
smell
i
tastes
like
a
decent
malty
and
hopped
ale
thats
being
overtaken
by
raspberries
bready
tart
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
little
creamy
in
the
texture
and
the
right
carbonation
level
im
almost
at
the
end
of
this
one
and
i
dont
have
a
really
strong
desire
to
open
another
therefore
i
place
the
drinkablity
a
bit
lower
that
the
other
categories
im
having
a
pilsner
next
my
advise
while
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
there
are
much
better
options
to
look
into
than
this
one
dont
drink
and
review
my
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
ecru
head
with
decent
retention
nose
was
filled
with
sweet
red
raspberry
i
have
recounted
many
times
in
my
reviews
of
my
late
paternal
grandmothers
raspberry
bush
in
her
backyard
garden
and
let
this
be
no
exception
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
amber
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
unexpected
raspberry
tartness
as
opposed
to
the
perfumy
taste
that
accompany
many
raspberry
beers
i
should
be
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
rather
than
a
chill
thanksgiving
morning
cest
la
vie
finish
was
very
dry
zephyr
winds
could
be
heard
blowing
across
the
sahara
i
think
that
i
may
sweeten
this
up
with
a
shot
of
that
labatts
porter
from
earlier
so
their
thought
of
beer
first
fruit
second
is
right
on
target
dont
be
turned
off
if
fruit
beers
are
not
your
thing
youll
be
surprised
of
how
well
this
ale
drinks
compared
to
the
fake
cloying
sweet
essenceladened
fruit
beers
out
there
notes
probably
my
favorite
fruit
based
beer
d
all
day
too
light
on
the
palate
feels
watered
down
the
tart
bite
is
minimal
a
very
disappointing
brew
infinitely
inferior
to
ng
raspberry
tart
the
taste
is
a
let
down
its
too
sweet
and
thats
all
it
is
not
a
complex
or
interesting
beer
at
all
a
pretty
decent
raspberry
ale
from
dark
horse
this
beer
is
definitely
sweet
fruit
first
beer
second
i
dont
mind
that
in
my
fruit
beers
but
would
like
the
sugar
toned
down
a
little
not
worth
it
at
10
a
sixpack
pretty
average
dark
amber
pour
with
a
finger
of
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
settles
smell
is
biscuit
malts
and
grains
and
a
fake
smelling
raspberry
unfortunately
the
taste
is
quite
fake
as
well
somewhat
watery
and
an
almost
metallic
fake
taste
to
it
medium
to
light
body
dont
bother
seeking
this
one
out
or
even
purchasing
it
if
you
see
it
very
average
brew
from
such
a
great
brewery
d
has
what
i
look
for
in
a
fruity
beer
well
rounded
not
overpowering
and
almost
dessert
like
id
have
this
with
food
a
decent
offering
from
dark
horse
nothing
special
but
something
that
even
a
non
craft
beer
drinker
could
approach
and
not
get
scared
off
hazed
yet
clear
honey
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
with
little
retention
or
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
raspberry
honey
yeast
and
some
mild
hoppy
bitterness
flavor
is
that
of
a
typical
biscuity
malty
amber
with
fresh
raspberry
added
to
it
slightly
sweet
no
tart
or
sour
presence
syrupy
medium
body
with
fairly
high
carbonation
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
lingering
fruitiness
but
slightly
watery
not
bad
but
merely
average
compared
to
other
dark
horse
beers
or
other
fruit
beers
d
pretty
decent
fruit
beer
it
is
better
than
most
i
have
tried
albeit
having
more
than
a
couple
would
be
a
struggle
it
was
definitely
not
worth
the
price
tag
though
d
ok
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
but
even
for
a
fruit
beer
its
not
great
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
low
it
smells
like
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
more
sweet
than
tart
and
wheatgrain
not
a
bad
aroma
at
all
the
taste
is
similar
but
slightly
weaker
than
the
aroma
it
tastes
just
like
raspberries
and
grain
mouthfeelbody
is
light
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
enough
beer
but
its
not
something
id
buy
all
the
time
drinkability
is
decent
not
interesting
enough
to
grab
a
whole
six
but
definitely
worth
a
try
on
occasion
betterr
than
99
of
the
other
fruity
candy
beers
that
are
marketed
these
days
notes
great
brewery
but
not
the
best
interpretation
of
the
style
just
a
little
too
dry
and
lacking
in
flavor
drinkability
its
a
summer
beer
that
goes
down
easy
lets
face
it
its
a
chick
beer
would
ladies
drink
it
i
dont
know
i
think
it
is
a
bit
bitter
for
there
taste
but
from
a
guys
standpoint
this
is
easy
drinking
on
sunny
afternoon
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
mixed
berries
red
raspberries
wheat
slightly
bitter
throughout
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
sneaking
in
once
in
a
while
light
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
quaff
able
enough
i
suppose
if
sam
adams
came
out
with
a
beer
called
rasberry
wheat
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
lots
of
wheat
and
artificial
fruit
flavoring
is
what
this
brew
is
about
its
not
offensive
or
anything
just
pretty
plain
and
uneventful
d
i
see
no
reason
not
to
have
another
but
this
is
probably
a
better
first
beer
of
the
night
than
anything
else
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
pours
a
cloudy
orange
colored
body
with
a

somewhat
lasting
has
a
raspberry
malty
aroma
a
light
wheat
raspberry
taste
has
a
tart
diet
sugar
taste
light
but
pretty
tasty
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
the
pour
and
first
whiffs
but
it
didnt
taste
quite
as
good
as
the
first
impressions
not
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
as
girlie
and
femanine
as
it
gets
too
think
i
sent
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
wish
i
had
tasted
it
prior
to
sending
this
was
a
pretty
boring
beer
appearance
is
relatively
bland
straw
yellow

with
maybe
a
hint
of
red
no
head
or

smell
is
kinda
fruity
and
some
sweeter
yeast
ester
noted
could
not
pick
up
any
malt
or
hops
same
goes
for
the
taste
but
too
much
raspberry
for
me
tastes
kind
of
fake
mouthfeel
is
on
par
for
the
style
drinks
like
a
wine
cooler
this
one
was
pretty
lame
for
sure
easily
the
worst
ive
had
from
dark
horse
all
this
did
was
make
me
want
a
rubaeus
for
a
real
raspberry
ale
go
with
that
one
pours
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
15
inch
head
with
poor
retention
and
no

smells
sharply
of
raspberry

low
carbonation
tastes
of
a
raspberry
with
an
mouthfeel
leaving
a
tartness
and
dryness
on
the
tongue
gets
sweeter
and
less
tart
the
more
you
drink
a
slight
malt
can
be
tasted
in
the
background
overall
sweet
enough
not
too
carbonated
and
not
too
tart
to
be
a
turnoff
one
of
the
better
raspberry
flavored
brews
ive
had
first
tried
a
little
sample
that
reminded
me
of
founder
roubious
on
that
note
i
had
to
try
a
pint
what
a
mistake
a
little
sample
of
this
beer
is
nice
a
pint
is
just
too
much
a
light
yellow
sparkly
pour
the
raspberry
flavor
is
nice
but
that
is
all
this
beer
has
nothing
is
behind
the
sweet
fruit
flavor
so
after
a
while
it
felt
as
if
i
was
drinking
some
sort
of
raspberry
cream
soda
i
could
give
this
to
my
children
as
a
nice
treat
pours
an
ambercopper
colorwith
a
thin
white
head
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
wonderful
fruit
aromathat
matched
the
initial
taste
of
raspberries
and
faint
hopslater
on
i
got
some
of
the
malt
flavor
to
boot
nothing
really
stood
out
in
this
ale
but
i
find
it
to
be
well
rounded
and
not
too
tart
like
some
fruit
beers
tend
to
be
nive
crisp
finishdry
i
buy
this
once
a
month
or
so
just
for
a
change
straight
up
raspberry
beers
arent
quite
my
thing
but
this
one
was
decent
not
exactly
earth
shattering
or
anything
but
it
drank
well
and
was
fairly
pleasant
i
went
after
this
one
because
of
the
other
beers
dark
horse
has
put
out
but
this
one
just
doesnt
make
the
grade
drinkability
not
a
total
loss
but
not
one
id
take
a
chance
on
again
this
fella
poured
a
darkly
and
thickly
into
teh
glass
and
was
just
raspberries
all
over
from
start
to
finish
the
berries
were
definitely
apparent
from
the
smell
alone
and
then
upon
drinking
it
finished
with
a
crisp
raspberry
bite
im
not
much
into
the
fruity
ales
but
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
those
who
are
all
in
all
was
well
done
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
on
the
pour
smell
is
raspberry
of
course
with
some
underlying
malt
as
well
theres
a
good
amount
of
raspberry
in
the
flavor
but
its
not
overdone
i
love
dark
horse
brewing
but
this
is
rather
uneventful
and
thin
ill
stick
with
their
dark
beers
and
ipas
poured
from
bottle
on
recent
michigan
beer
trip
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
nice
white
head
minimal
lacing
and
mediocre
retention
smell
is
of
some
raspberry
some
wheat
and
a
bit
of
biscuity
malt
taste
is
good
however
i
found
it
to
be
somewhat
bland
there
was
a
nice
raspberry
element
to
it
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
but
other
than
that
it
was
somewhat
lacking
i
think
something
just
needed
to
stand
out
more
but
it
didnt
mouthfeel
was
great
very
light
and
somewhat
crisp
slightly
oily
afterfeel
overall
a
good
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
the
fruit
beers
so
i
did
enjoy
this
just
wasnt
amazing
overall
not
bad
at
alla
wellrealized
and
restrained
fruit
beer
that
might
appeal
to
folks
who
think
strong
fruit
beers
are
overwhelming
or
running
amok
it
also
shows
that
dark
horse
doesnt
have
to
hit
10
and
the
flavor
of
diesel
with
all
of
its
offerings
drinkability
i
like
the
fact
that
the
raspberry
flavor
stays
true
to
the
fruit
and
that
the
beer
is
a
neutral
palate
against
which
the
raspberries
get
to
strut
their
stuff
however
i
also
wish
that
there
were
a
bit
more
bulk
and
complexity
here
its
essentially
a
chick
beer
that
guys
can
tolerate
d
this
is
a
really
nice
change
from
all
of
the
crap
fruit
beers
out
there
this
is
how
it
should
be
done
good
beer
first
and
foremost
with
accents
of
tasty
fruit
im
impressed
d
drinkability
is
good
for
something
so
meh
a
rare
just
ok
beer
from
dark
horse
overall
this
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
fairly
mild
it
was
ok
but
not
anything
that
ill
seek
out
d
easy
drinking
with
great
fruit
flavor
a
perfect
summer
beer
choice
not
very
complex
but
not
overly
fruity
or
cloying
like
most
fruit
beers
nothing
bad
about
this
one
just
nothing
outstanding
in
any
aspect
the
fruit
is
not
abundant
or
fresh
and
the
base
beer
is
average
bottoms
up
mouthfeel
is
creamy
from
carbonation
glass
was
well
chosen
as
it
really
makes
this
beer
pop
smooth
dry
crispness
an
easy
drinking
flavorful
raspberry
ale
d
a
decent
fruit
beer
not
a
lot
drawing
me
to
it
though
decent
fruit
session
beer
but
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
raspberry
flavor
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
little
to
no
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
filled
with
raspberry
grains
and
wheat
there
is
some
melon
in
the
taste
along
with
raspberry
nicely
tart
more
grains
stock
amber
feel
to
it
otherwise
the
mouth
is
full
enough
decent
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
odd
duck
it
is
pours
a
hazy
burnt
amber
color
with
some
floaties
34
of
an
inch
of
creamy
white
head
has
average
retention
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
smells
faintly
of
tart
raspberries
lemon
straw
and
honey
tastes
of
honey
sweetness
followed
by
some
biscuit
wheat
then
the
raspberry
presence
comes
in
with
a
light
lemon
finish
medium
light
in
body
with
good
fizzy
carbonation
smooth
and
crisp
but
a
little
thin
a
nice
sweetness
combined
with
some
tart
and
sour
notes
for
a
good
balance
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
dark
horse
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
definitely
good
to
enjoy
on
one
of
those
hot
summer
days
tasted
on
tap
at
firkin
in
libertyville
on
32908
they
had
just
run
out
of
kbs
2
hours
prior
dthis
one
held
up
well
in
my
cellar
a
totally
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
nice
the
bottom
line
not
as
bad
as
some
would
make
it
out
to
be
but
dark
horses
raspberry
ale
falters
mainly
for
being
so
mediocre
good
marks
on
the
nose
and
mouth
and
the
flavour
has
potential
if
they
can
just
work
that
slight
offtaste
out
of
it
the
mouthfeel
suffers
more
because
raspberry
ale
is
flat
halfway
througha
cardinal
sin
but
not
a
total
surprise
with
the
amazing
disappearing
head
that
started
it
off
this
also
detracts
from
the
drinkability
making
what
could
have
been
a
fairly
good
beer
merely
ok
id
recommend
great
divides
wild
raspberry
over
dark
horses
version
ultimately
im
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beer
and
this
is
i
believe
the
first
time
dark
horse
has
disappointed
me
id
like
to
think
it
was
the
style
more
than
the
brewer
but
for
beer
lovers
stick
to
the
other
terrific
wares
that
dark
horse
does
which
are
splendid
this
sadly
is
not
if
anyone
can
do
a
good
fruit
beer
dark
horse
can
i
wouldnt
have
picked
this
up
if
it
werent
for
the
review
in
ba
magazine

not

taste
is
rather
dull
with
about
equal
malt
and
raspberry
flavors
somewhat
light
bodied
with
low

overall
tastes
thin
and
watery
with
a
little
raspberry
flavor

not
as
much
in

nor
as
fresh

id
like
easy
to
drink
still
drinkabilitynotes
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
wellsuited
to
warm
weather
drinking
tastes
much
firmer
which
is
a
relief
the
yeast
is
strong
for
a
weak
beer
very
crisp
and
not
at
all
lambic
funky
a
good
thing
since
theres
few
things
worse
than
identityless
fruit
beers
that
try
to
be
lambics
the
malt
is
there
but
its
as
blank
as
a

the
raspberry
is
tame

certainly
present

not
at

theres
a
very
nice

here
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
of
the
10
or
so
ive
tried
from
a
brewery
that
ive
really
come
to
like
over
the
past
year
with
my
sporadic
samplings
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
drink
to
everybody
even
the
doubters
of
a
good
fruit
beer
i
must
say
that
i
was
taken
aback
by
this
beer
i
threw
it
into
a
mixed
six
pack
because
i
hadnt
seen
it
in
the
store
before
i
didnt
expect
much
because
i
generally
dont
like
fruit
beers
i
must
say
that
this
one
has
changed
my
stance
this
is
top
shelf
stuff
it
is
tasty
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
next
summer
the
fruit
isnt
overpowering
like
some
other
beers
d
this
beer
has
big
raspberries
in
the
nose
but
they
were
much
softer
in
the
taste
there
were
lots
of
other
fruit
flavors
that
were
not
so
interesting
pours
a
slightly
reddishamber
color
with
a
nice
ring
of
white
head
that
settles
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
a
little
opaque
but
mostly
clear
nose
is
mild
raspberries
a
little
bit
of
hop
presence
too
taste
is
better
its
not
an
overwhelming
raspberry
punch
like
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
but
better
balanced
with
the
malt
and
hops
obviously
raspberries
dominate
the
flavor
but
theres
also
some
breadiness
some
light
hops
especially
as
the
beer
warms
and
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
too
id
been
looking
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
but
didnt
really
want
to
buy
a
whole
sixer
of
it
im
quite
happy
to
have
tried
it
ontap
a
tasty
beer
definitely
good
for
a
change
from
more
common
beers
and
beer
styles

in
the

think
this
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
as
the
raspberry
has
faded
out
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
could
see
this
being
pretty
messy
fresh
although
still
pretty
drinkable
as
it
is
overall
this
is
the
most
awkward
tasting
raspberry
beer
ive
ever
had
the
finish
is
striking
and
unpleasant
the
tart
raspberry
taste
is
nice
but
very
subdued
its
like
a
light
pale
ale
with
raspberries
interesting
intriguing
and
innovative
but
not
inspiring
d
good
beer
for
a
hot
afternoon
although
its
deceivingly
sweet
after
a
while
and
probably
couldnt
do
many
of
them
the
look
of
this
one
is
attractivehazy
honey
orange
in
color
with
some
active
carbonation
and
funky
suspension
going
on
the
head
though
is
more
like
soda
than
beernoisy
fizzy
and
completely
gone
almost
immediately
the
nose
is
cleanly
grainy
with
some
fruit
that
invokes
citrus
as
much
as
raspberry
yow
no
doubt
about
the
raspberry
in
the
taste
though
its
actually
an
uncommonly
fresh
taste
for
a
fruit
beer
though
its
still
stronger
than
i
hope
for
visavis
the
underlying
grains
the
finish
isnt
so
good
with
the
less
appealing
remnants
of
both
the
fruit
and
the
malts
both
lingering
theres
enough
crispness
in
this
one
to
cancel
out
what
might
be
a
sweet
clingy
mouthfeel
im
a
fan
of
raspberry
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
even
so
one
is
plenty
a
good
thing
to
do
at
a
place
where
you
have
the
luxury
of
force
carbonating
is
to
mix
in
some
white
sugar
after
secondary
to
increase
the
sweetness
after
the
yeast
sucks
out
all
the
residuals
from
the
fruit
addition
yeast
would
have
to
be
crashed
completely
of
course
thats
the
only
thing
imo
that
wouldcould
make
this
better
other
than
that
its
still
refreshing
this
brew
pours
a
yellowgold
color
with
a
thin

and
spotty

the
aroma

an
underlying

the

no

as
far
as
im
concerned
dark

needs
to
retool
raspberry
ale
who
knows
maybe
they
sell
boatloads
of
it
to
those
who
are
frightened
off
by
anything
that
isnt
light
and
fruity
and
easy
to
drink
its
all
of
those
things
but
i
require
more
than
that
i
suspect
that
most
bas
do
too
pours
a
very
cloudy

small

aroma

i
was
rather
surprised
at
how
big
the
raspberry
smell
was
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
big
raspberry
with
some
malts
behind
it
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
syrupy
side
for
me
this
was
too
sweet
for
my
preference
although
my
wife
said
its
biggest
fault
was
being
too
easy
to
drink
so
there
you
go
not
my
first
choice
of
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
good
for
what
it
is
a
very
light
lager
with
a
hint
of
pinkpurple
to
it
smell
is
grainy
with
fresh
raspberry
the
raspberry
flavor
is
surprisingly
and
pleasantly
natural
like
a
simple
splash
of
fresh
raspberry
juice
how
many
brewers
would
have
added
syrup
or
sugar
to
produce
a
koolaid
flavor
not
dark
horse
its
actually
a
bit
understated
resulting
in
a
somewhat
watery
body
a
bit
more
hops
andor
maltiness
wouldnt
hurt
but
thats
a
minor
complaint

that
i
could
see
being

this
one
just
falls
a

flat

me
nothing

and
i
dont
desire
another
single
bottle
from
star
in

brought

in
a

d
a
solid
fruit
beer
this
one
would
go
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
seriously
there
is
no
rasberry
in
the
flavor
either
just
rotting
hay
and
vegetables
not
one
that
i
want
to
revisit
anytime
soon
but
if
i
encounter
a
bottle
that
i
am
100
sure
of
its
freshness
i
might
pick
one
up
im
not
a
big
fan
of
most
fruit
beers
but
if
i
was
oh
man
this
would
be
the
one
pours
out
to
a
moderately
hazed
orange
color
with
low
carbonation
and
a
small
head
of
white
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
raspberries
is
noted
but
not
much
else
taste
is
mild
with
little
evidence
of
its
contents
light
fruity
flavors
over
bland
malts
and
a
touch
of
grain
mouthfeel
was
uneventful
little
carbonation
on

drinkability
is

more
along
the
lines
of
a
flavored

beer
but
its
drinkable
special
thanks
to
piecesofflair
for
the
sample
the
taste
is
a
little
tarter

i
expected
and
actually
came
as

its

me
drinkability
pretty
good
drinkabilityoverall
its
no
raspberry
tart
but
its
not
really
meant
to
be
a
fairly
standard
yet
fairly
drinkable
fruit
ale
though
my
girlfriend
whinced
when
she
tried
it
all
in
all
if
you
are
a
dark
horse
fan
try
it
but
a
quality
fruit
beer
this
isnt
but
i
think
new
glarus
raspberry
tary
spoils
me
methinks
i
shall
try
another
one
and
pair
it
with
a
cham
torte
dessert
poured
a
murky
brownish
orange
into
a
pink
glass
floaty
yeast
was
apparent
didnt
realize
there
was
this
much
yeast
in
it
nose
was
of
some
floraly
hops
and
very
faint
rasperry
taste
was
of
light
malt
lighter
raspberry
and
a
little
hoppy
bite
not
too
impressed
was
rather
easy
to
drink
but
didnt
care
too
much
for
it
ill
see
whats
next
drinkability
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
beer
poured
a
murky
orange
yellow
color
and
formed
a
pure
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
hops
and
a
small
amount
of
raspberry
the
flavor
was
of
hops
raspberry
in
the
beginning
that
faded
near
the
end
the
finish
was
light
and
a
bit
spirte
not
really
reflecting
much
of
the
raspberry
the
sour
mouthfeel
leaves
for
a
undesirable
texture
making
this
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
tried
id
pass
this
one
if
searching
for
a
good
raspberry
ale
drinkability
i
have
only
recently
started
buying
and
enjoying
more
fruit
beers
and
this
is
one
i
can
recomend
and
will
enjoy
myself
again
and
again
as
long
as
there
ice
cold
taste
tart
raspberries
are
there
but
theyre
mild
and
not
overwhelming
a
bit
of
oranges
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
its
a
fairly
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
think
would
have
been
much
better
during
the
summer
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
to
it
it
has
a
small
white
head
that
fizzles
down
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
with
no
lacing
the
smell
is
good
mostly
raspberry
and
a
touch
of
what
smells
like
someone
getting
a
perm
its
strangely
nice
the
taste
is
raspberry
mixed
with
the
hops
of
a
good
pale
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
recommend
it
drinkability
is
not
that
grand
as
this
is
a
fruit
beer
after
all
i
cannot
see
a
reason
for
drinking
more
than
one
maybe
if
i
was
a
girl
i
can
always
hope
i
guess
slàinte
bottle
provided
by
eyedrinkale
ala
bif20
thanks
much
for
the
opportunity
pours
an
enormous
three
finger
fluffy
head
too
much
carbonation
from
only
half
of
the
beer
poured
so
far
cloudy
and
tangerine
in
color
this
beer
looks
like
a
wit
smells
raspberry
with
some
sweet
and
also
a
waxy
that
makes
me
think
of
a
raspberry
scented
candle
tastes
only
mildly
raspberry
and
a
little
bit
yeasty
its
wet
sweet
and
lacks
the
sourtart
that
often
is
found
in
raspberry
beers
aftertaste
has
apricot
mixed
berries
and
orange
melon
mediumlight
body
and
mildy
carbonated
must
have
all
been
released
during
the
pour
a
sweet
and
fruity
drink
thats
light
and
refreshing
had
this
at
the
brass
restaurant
in
mount
pleasant
on
tapas
night
1
00
off
so
i
gave
it
a
shotpours
a
hazy
blond
with
the
red
raspberry
tint
aromas
of
fresh
raspberry
puree
and
wheaty
maltflavors
are
not
as
tart
as
expected
more
sweetwith
a
firm
dry
malt
backbone
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
but
gave
it
a
try
not
all
bad
for
the
style
but
i
wont
have
it
again
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
topped
with
a
cream
colored
rather
thin
head
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
an
american
wheat
beer
flavor
also
has
nice
wheat
crispness
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
also
a
hint
of
coriander
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
the
raspberry
is
very
subtle
and
offers
just
a
hint
of
fruit
flavor
however
the
flavor
becomes
just
a
bit
artificial
as
you
continue
to
enjoy
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
this
is
a
fairly
refreshing
beer
im
not
big
into
fruit
beers
and
i
must
have
picked
this
one
up
in
a
state
of
michigan
beer
confusion
as
i
was
trying
to
pare
40
some
offerings
down
to
12
only
got
to
21
and
i
still
have
thoughts
of
going
to
pick
up
a
couple
others
however
it
is
a
solid
offering
and
one
of
the
few
fruit
beers
i
would
drink
again
gotta
hand
it
to
them
for
what
this
is
a
raspberry
beer
pours
a
dark
strawamber
color
massive
head
and
decent
lacing
smells
like
well
raspberries
i
guess
thats
what
they
are
going
for
so
they
nailed
it
taste
is
purely
the
tartness
of
the
raspberries
and
well
nothing
else
no
hint
of
hops
or
malt
very
clean
very
carbonated
so
much
so
that
it
tends
to
explode
in
your
mouth
a
good
beer
for
a
fruit
beer
something
for
the
less
hardcore
beer
drinkers
to
go
for
poured
cloudy
amber
small
diminising
head
little
lacing
aroma
raspberry
some
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
orange
flavor
was
weak
raspberry
i
thought
by
the
stronger
aroma
of
raspberry
there
would
have
been
more
flavor
to
this
got
hints
of
lemon
and
orange
maybe
if
i
hadnt
tasted
kuhnhenn
eis
bock
raspberry
i
might
have
liked
this
better
this
beer
bridges
the
gap
between
light
and
flavorful
manages
to
be
a
relatively
light
beer
but
with
a
nice
full
bodied
wheat
presence
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worthy
of
quaffing
several
liters
ill
pass
on
this
one
and
keep
buying
your
stouts
average
through
and
through
a
big
u
p
thanks
goes
to
trbeer
for
the
many
samples
on
the
palate
there
is
ample
raspberry
infusions
charged
with
silky
windy
lines
of
gas
more
neutral
than
assertive
and
thankfully
not
sweet
at
all
tangy
buttered
grain
flavors
at
the
root
nice
that
they
didnt
overplay
the
raspberry
or
the
sugar
kudos
without
many
fruit
beers
under
my
belt
thisone
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
thanks
cjrmellor
for
the
sample
the
brew
poured
a
cloudy
hazy
orangecopper
with
a
average
size
slight
fiz
to
its
eggshell
colored
head
lace
was
good
and
stuck
around
the
aroma
was
faint
with
a
berry
malt
on
the
nose
a
taste
rush
of
flavored
citrus
berry
and
of
coarse
raspberry
its
followed
by
a
watered
down
wave
toward
the
finish
just
a
hint
of
hop
and
raspberry
leave
the
mouth
dry
and
tart
a
very
drinkable
fruit
beer
id
like
to
try
a
cold
one
on
a
hot
summers
day
drinakability
is
pretty
good
given
a
fruit
beer
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
powerful
raspbeery
kick
here
the
pour
showed
a
light
copper
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
the
smell
was
strongly
of
wheat
malts
with
some
raspberry
the
taste
was
equivolent
of
the
smell
good
mix
of
wheat
and
raspberry
flavor
it
had
a
pretty
dry
texture
to
it
also
this
was
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
not
real
complex
or
deep
but
i
dont
think
it
was
meant
to
be
that
way
just
had
this
ontap
at
ashleys
a
pale
yellowish
copper
in
color
with
light
hints
of
pink
broad
loose
head
aromas
of
raspberries
and
grain
pretty
big
raspberry
taste
but
somehow
thinned
or
diluted
tastes
like
the
berries
are
drowning
in
water
and
losing
their
flavor
a
bit
very
little
backbone
and
not
a
very
crisp
finish
so
it
feels
a
bit
thin
but
this
is
a
supremely
easy
summer
refresher
went
down
so
so
fast
works
well
for
what
its
supposed
to
do
which
is
provide
an
easydrinking
summer
brew
id
imagine
i
know
other
people
have
slammed
this
but
i
loved
it
my
god
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
unreal
on
tap
at
the
bruery
poured
into
a
taster
by
the
server
trying
to
entice
bottle
purchases
appearance
is

by
the

medium

moderate

texture
clean
finish
on
tap
at
the
bruery
had
trouble
finishing
my
taster
in
the
flight
had
a
really
foul
aftertaste
great
belgium
fall
style
but
sets
itself
part
by
staying
away
from
pumpkin
and
turning
to
yams
instead
reddish
brown
color
with
nice
head
smells
of
yams
and
spices
tastes
of
yams
nutmeg
and
molasses
sweet
mixed
with
a
strong
vegetative
taste
not
necessarily
my
favorite
beer
but
i
think
its
pretty
well
done
for
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
at
the
very
least
its
unique
red
brown
body
nice
sized
cream
head
yeast
belgian
aroma
hints
of
banana
and
fig
slight
tart
taste
with
a
banana
and
maple
finish
has
a
lot
of
belgian
style
characteristics
its
ok
overall
this
is
quite
an
excellent
beer
i
love
the
perfect
balance
between
malt
and
fruit
and
sweet
and
sour
its
a
great
quaff
on
its
own
but
paired
with
food
especially
thanksgiving
dinner
its
absolutely
brilliant
not
my
favorite
ended
up
trying
to
finishing
most
of
the
bottle
myself
cause
the
wife
hated
it
was
ok
paired
with
some
dark
chocolate
but
all
the
unique
flavors
never
really
came
together
750ml
into
a
matching
bruery
snifter
the
brew
appears
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
yellow
cap
the
smells
of
yams
is
prevalent
initially
then
caramel
spice
and
earth
as
it
warms
as
the
experience
continues
its
almost
soapy
the
taste
is
tart
and
fruity
with
some
vegetative
component
that
isnt
that
great
a
bit
of
spice
inwould
not
drink
this
again
its
pretty
bad
strong
aroma
has
malty
pumpkin
and
spicy
notes
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
thick
butterytan
head
flavor
has
firm
malty
earthy
and
pumpkin
notes
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
maple
syrup
texture
has
good
body
and
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
definitely
worth
seeking
for
autumn
pours
a
medium
cloudy
brown
with
small
white
head
the
description
is
better
than
the
actual
experience
there
is
a
complex
flavor
of
maple
pears
and
nuts
but
very
tart
similar
to
an
oud
bruin
o
interesting
and
i
liked
it
maybe
a
little
more
spice
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
would
make
it
even
better
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
but
what
is
so
interesting
is
that
the
nose
and
flavors
were
so
identical
i
catch
belgian
yeast
at
first
with
sweet
potatoes
light
clove
nutmeg
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
malt
toffee
and
then
an
odd
turn
to
bubblegum
complex
and
pleasantly
different
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
awesome
but
im
not
upset
i
bought
it
to
go
with
thanksgiving
dinner
same
feeling
i
get
with
each
bruery
beer
i
try
itd
taste
a
ton
better
if
the
price
point
was
lower
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
it
really
wasnt
a
pumpkin
beer
but
an
autumn
beer
i
dont
know
what
they
mean
by
yams
i
live
in
the
south
and
a
damn
yam
is
not
a
sweet
potato
if
it
is
sweet
potatoes
then
they
need
to
say
what
it
is
anyway
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
has
intrigued
me
enough
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
which
i
have
heard
are
much
better
anyway
it
was
a
good
deal
for
the
beer
considering
the
flavors
and
size
of
the
bottle
i
would
suggest
this
one
and
i
might
purchase
this
one
again
next
year
if
i
decide
to
even
hop
on
the
fall
beer
train
i
am
kind
of
over
it
at
this
point
and
this
was
the
last
one
of
the
year
and
i
saved
it
for
the
last
fall
holiday
thanksgiving
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
maple
yams
are
subtle
enjoyed
this
with
buttermilk
blue
and
red
rock
cheeses
autumn
maple
is
a
great
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
style
leave
it
up
to
the
bruery
to
take
the
road
less
traveled
and
create
a
pumpkin
alestyle
beer
and
leave
the
pumpkin
out
completely
the
yams
work
nicely
on
the
mouthfeel
and
likely
help
this
beer
achieve
the
high
abv
lots
of
fermentable
sugars
in
yams
the
beer
is
spicy
sweet
and
alcoholic
without
overdoing
any
of
those
things
really
good
stuff
taste
fig
raisin
yam
and
maple
this
beer
takes
an
interesting
direction
with
the
belgian
qualities
as
i
thought
the
ingredients
would
be
much
more
suited
to
a
dark
stout
it
mostly
works
despite
a
few
hiccups
in
the
form
of
harshness
or
flavors
that
dont
quite
mesh
in
the
end
its
enjoyable
but
not
necessarily
a
beer
id
have
more
than
one
of
o
a
very
interested
and
pleasant
take
on
the
pumpkinyam
beer
ill
certainly
seek
this
out
once
a
year
o
a
bit
disappointed
at
the
prevalence
of
alcohol
in
here
however
it
is
10
so
a
little
is
to
be
expected
the
reason
this
works
for
a
fall
beer
is
the
mixture
of
yams
and
brown
sugar
it
screams
fall
if
some
of
the
alcohol
heat
was
lost
this
would
be
great
well
i
was
impressed
with
this
brown
ale
the
quick
hit
of
the
molasses
soothes
out
to
a
candied
yam
finiish
the
aftertaste
to
me
was
subtle
spices
that
only
lasted
for
less
then
a
minute
the
smell
was
soft
and
pairable
with
its
flavors
if
you
are
looking
for
a
brew
with
flavors
inspired
from
old
fashioned
dutch
then
its
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
it
would
be
better
if
the
molasses
flavor
didnt
overpower
the
maple
i
like
it
otherwise
maybe
its
a
california
thing
but
he
molasses
hit
my
palate
first
which
was
not
what
i
expected
interdasting
drank
slow
got
hot
drank
slower
got
hotter
delicious
spice
sweet
enjoyed
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
color
with
a
short
lived
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
like
candied
yams
perhaps
a
touch
of
fruit
and
certainly
alcohol
tastes
follow
suit
with
sweet
candied
yams
alcohol
belgian
yeast
stranger
dryness
and
an
overall
strange
profile
the
maple
adds
to
the
sweetness
and
the
beer
really
doesnt
go
anywhere
more
of
a
chore
than
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
certainly
interesting
id
definitely
only
recommend
it
as
a
desert
beer
for
someone
who
really
loves
yams
on
second
try
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
a
pretty
decent
fall
beer
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
coiffing
pours
a
dark
red
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
mocha
colored
head
smells
like
maple
syrup
yams
cinnamon
brown
sugar
sweet
bread
tastes
predominantly
like
candied
yams
with
subtle
cloves
and
nutmeg
in
the
finish
yikes
not
quite
what
i
remembered
from
last
year
enjoyable
but
too
heavy
on
the
yam
poured
crisply
had
a
nice
sweet
smell
of
the
yams
it
boasted
as
well
as
everything
autumnal
but
the
taste
sadly
washed
down
with
more
of
a
cough
medicine
sensation
very
sugary
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
and
the
taste
lingered
for
a
little
longer
than
i
wouldve
liked
as
well
this
years
version
was
the
highlight
on
tap
but
from
the
bottle
not
so
much
i
guess
it
does
makes
a
difference
you
get
spice
nutmeg
slightly
hot
but
drinkable
the
color
is
maple
syrup
brown
but
the
taste
not
so
much
the
overall
taste
is
balanced
on
tap
with
the
bold
flavors
of
liquid
yams
spices
sweet
mouthful
of
goodness
the
bottle
is
lack
of
any
of
yams
and
its
heatalcohol
overpowers
it
its
very
inconsistent
to
what
i
tasted
on
tap
then
from
the
bottle
go
figure
cheers
i
realize
experimentaion
is
how
you
create
new
product
this
seems
like
a
mistake
they
brewed
to
much
of
and
said
well
lets
put
it
in
a
fancy
bottle
with
a
fancy
label
and
someone
will
buy
it
please
dont
yuk
this
is
hard
to
evaluate
its
supposed
to
be
a
brown
ale
and
its
definitely
brown
and
sweet
but
the
flavor
is
so
mixed
up
that
nothing
stands
out
except
a
continual
sweetness
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
and
vegetable
beers
but
his
one
is
pretty
good
took
this
over
to
my
beer
grus
house
for
a
snobbery
session
i
picked
this
one
up
on
clearance
for
10
at
first
the
taste
was
void
not
great
but
it
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
bonus
points
overall
because
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
10
overall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
hope
to
have
again
depending
upon
cost
my
eager
young
beer
cadet
whom
is
quite
the
expert
now
brought
this
one
over
to
split
its
quite
different
than
i
expected
very
light
for
10
and
slightly
tangy
and
tart
almost
like
a
wild
ale
not
exactly
the
strong
brown
ale
with
maple
syrup
like
i
thought
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
highly

a
pungent
bitterness
that
im

is
coming
from

this

a
decent
brew
would
compliment
a
thanksgiving

very
well
if
you
like
a
lot
of
flavors
bouncing

your
pallate
this
is
a
flavorful
rich
beer
drinkablity
is
high
but
the
booziness
makes
it
a
sipper
goes
well
with
multiple
foods
i
had
it
with
thanksgiving
dinner
and
it
went
well
with
roasted
turkey
sweet
potatoes
and
cranberries
pours
a
mahogany
with
an
offwhite
froth
and
decent

the
nose
is
soft
and
complex
with

clove
dark

slight
funk
a
slight

character
the
flavors
cover
everything
listed
above
with
a
slightly
tart
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slightly
dry
with
some
weight
and
a
long
finish
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
i
was
happy
to
have
last
thanksgiving
thrilled
to
have
this
thanksgiving
and
look
forward
to
having
at
my
next
an
absolute
must
try
pours
a
beautiful
dark
orange
with
a
nice
white
billowy
head
it
smells
spicy
with
a
touch
of
yams
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
dominated
by
alcohol
i
could
detect
some
yam
flavor
especially
when
it
warmed
up
it
has
a
nice
flavor
but
it
seemed
hotter
than
other
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
the
drinkability
suffers
somewhat
to
me
due
to
booziness
of
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
but
the
alcohol
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
i
hope
to
try
other
beers
from
the
bruery
sometime
soon
the
pour
is
very
attractive
crimson
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
thin
tan
head
rises
briefly
receding
to
a
disk
the
nose
really
is
a
melange
of
rich
sweetness
and
spices
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
being
quite
prominent
molasses
and
maple
syrup
are
apparent
but
the
yam
character
is
rather
whelmed
by
the
high
level
of
spices
yeast
character
is
present
but
again
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
spices
the
palate
opens
with
a
rich
sweetness
with
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
with
a
definite
molasses
component
the
spices
really
dominate
the
midpalate
and
the
finish
big
and
prominent
the
yams
arent
particularly
noticeable
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
mediumbodied
beer
is
quite
perfectly
carbonated
its
soft
and
smooth
on
the
palate
i
drank
about
8oz
of
this
beer
and
could
have
consumed
more
but
its
a
beer
i
will
drink
about
once
a
year
overall
this
is
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
fall
evening
a
bit
of
complexity
if
not
the
most
wellrounded
flavor
they
definately
capture
the
essence
of
fall
though
a
good
job
d
the
drinkability
is
good
and
the
sweet
potato
fragrance
and
taste
goes
well
with
the
brown
nice
sweet
flavors
to
balance
the
spices
and
the
drinkability
while
good
is
not
the
type
of
ale
i
would
be
interested
in
drinking
more
than
1
of
really
not
beneficial
given
the
strength
the
bruery
has
a
nice
fall
beer
here
its
certainly
something
that
could
be
built
upon
and
improved
i
dont
have
any
real
problems
with
the
flavor
its
good
but
the
alcohol
taste
is
too
strong
and
a
little
warm
more
bubbles
all
around
would
help
too
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
like
autumn
maple
its
certainly
worth
checking
out
with
that
said
it
needs
a
couple
of
tweaks
i
suspect
this
release
is
a
tad
better
than
last
years
due
to
the
carbonation
issue
keep
working
on
it
guys
youre
getting
there
an
interesting
brew
with
interesting
ingredients
that
work
well
with
the
belgianesque
character
creative
and
enjoyable
as
a
unique
autumn
brew
not
a
bad
beer
a
different
take
on
fall
beer
compared
to
all
the
other
pumpkin
ales
but
i
think
it
misses
the
mark
d
750
ml
bottle
is
good
for
23
people
easily
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
as
there
are
so
many
top
notch
belgian
ales
and
spiced
autumn
winter
seasonals
that
i
enjoy
much
more
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
but
a
full
flavor
mild
carbonation
and
very
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
ok
although
its
honestly
a
bit
disappointing
i
dont
know
if
its
aged
pourly
or
if
it
was
too
late
in
the
night
when
i
had
it
the
first
time
but
ive
got
4
more
so
i
hope
it
improves
right
now
it
just
tastes
a
bit
to
heavy
and
sharply
flavored
f
still
finishes
a
little
sweet
i
was
hoping
it
would
dry
out
a
little
more
as
i
have
to
go
through
the
whole
750ml
by
myself
it
adds
more
of
the
rich
creamy
roasted
malt
and
toffee
flavors
at
the
end
as
well
a
little
more
molasses
and
maple
flavor
linger
a
bit
but
not
too
long
a
couple
burps
bring
back
only
maple
flavor
its
pretty
bright
as
well
on
the
finish
a
little
more
alcohol
spice
and
warmth
i
think
im
starting
to
get
some
spice
and
vanilla
long
after
the
swallow
spice
such
as
nutmeg
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
an
interesting
addition
d
a
great
beer
in
general
but
really
nice
to
have
around
for
thanksgiving
mouthfeel
features
good
body
and
density
to
go
with
substantial
flavour
a
bit
acidic
and
a
bit
gassy
a
solid
ring
remained
and
head
was
easily
regenerated

the
very
end

beer
might
be
too
cold
so
im
gonna
give
it
a
minute
to
warm
ok
so
not
a
huge
improvement
in
the
smell
im
getting
a
sweet
belgian
aroma
some
spice
both
yeasty
and
added
perhaps
some
hints
of
orange
im
not
picking
up
a
whole
lot
of
malt
character
which
isnt
awesome
for
a
brownish
beer
the
flavor
is
an
interesting
maplemilk

nice
and
round
with

is
evident
enough
and
proof
that
the
bruery
fixed
the
problems
they
evidently
had
last

with

this
is
more
a
sipper
than
chugger
murky
brown
cider
like
color
with
a
fluffy
bubbly
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
nothing
very
still
appearance
no
lacing
aroma
is
fairly
mild
a
little
disappointing
that
it
isnt
stronger
given
the
ingredients
in
this
beer
very
earthy
vegetablelike
and
belgiany
aroma
with
mild
sweetness
the
maple
i
suppose
but
i
cant
actually
identify
that
specifically
some
peppery
and
cinnamon
spices
doesnt
really
open
up
much
more
as
it
warms
up
sadly
flavor
isnt
that
much
different
than
what
i
imagine
an
unibroue
pumpkin
beer
might
taste
like
well
you
can
tell
the
difference
between
the
yams
used
instead
of
pumpkins
but
as
for
what
the
spice
and
maple
contribute
there
isnt
anything
that
unique
full
bodied
syrup
like
with
high
carbonation
seems
like
issues
from
last
years
batch
didnt
carry
over
in
that
regard
taste
starts
off
like
a
dark
belgian
ale
before
the
spices
come
in
cinnamon
light
clove
etc
finish
has
both
an
earthy
vegetable
taste
the
yams
and
a
slight
sweetness
the
maple
but
neither
is
overpowering
and
are
nicely
balanced
alcohol
has
a
warming
presence
but
never
burns
or
is
found
in
the
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
a
nice
alternative
to
the
glut
of
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
this
time
of
year
but
slightly
disappointed
that
if
youre
not
paying
close
attention
as
you
drink
its
just
another
dark
belgian
i
liked
this
the
combo
of
the
yams
maple
syrup
and
spice
made
for
a
pleasant
falllike
feel
in
the
mouth
and
the
higher
alcohol
guarantees
youll
get
warmed
up
on
those
cool
autumn
nights
this
was
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
damn
tasty
one
autumn
maple
tastes
like
a
sweet
yam
casserole
with
brown
sugar
black
pepper
grape
juice
lemon
and
a
multitude
of
spices
theres
definitely
a
lot
going
on
here
the
beer
is
spritzy
in
mouthfeel
but
its
thin
too
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
taste
of
pumpkins
in
my
beer
over
the
taste
of
yams
incredibly
smooth
and
full
on
the
mouthfeel
im
really
digging
this
beer
dtasty
and
unique
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
certainly
a
sipper
of
a
brew
to
be
enjoyed
as
it
transforms
as
it
warms
becoming
more
and
more
earthy
and
aromatic

fitting
tribute

into

the
aroma
is
of
nice
spicy
belgian
yeast
banana

clove
brown
sugar
and

the
maple
aroma
comes
through
as
the

warms
the
taste
is
vinous
a
plum
fruitiness
an
earthy
spice
tone
light
lemon
tartness
the
molasses
and
maple
syrup
add
the
sweetness
to
the
brew
but
are
fairly
subtle
and
blend
with
what
i
imagine
is
the
yam
not
much
yam
flavor
but
i
pick
it
up
towards
the
end
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
perhaps
a
touch
syrupy
and
sticky
light
carbonation
and
quite
noticable
abv
an
interesting
brew
needs
to
tone
down
the
booze
so
that
the
other
flavors
come
through
perhaps
some
aging
would
do
the
trick
these
guys
are
something
else
i
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
try
anything
new
from
the
bruery

we
go
this
one

an
awesome

season
a

this
beer
is
difficult
to
review
because
there
is
so
much
happening
here
thanksgiving
in
a
bottle
really
the
light
maple
syrup
note
works
well
with
the
sweetness
and
mild
spiciness
of
the
brew
the
alcohol
content
is
detectable
but
it
cuts
right
through
the
flavor
in
a
way
that
enhances
the
experience
rather
than
hurt
it
this
beer
is
hot
in
a
good
way
im
really
enjoying
this
thanksgiving
in
a
bottle
the
abv
level
is
a
bit
high
while
i
dont
taste
it
i
am
certainly
starting
to
feel
it
at
the
halfway
point
in
this
25oz
bottle
other
than
that
though
its
super
tasty
and
easy
to
drink

dominated

part
of
the
equation
which
doesnt
let
the
seasonal
tastes
come
through
enough
mouthfeel
is
medium

with
strong

a
bit
more
that
i
prefer
but
still
great
drinkability
while
chilled
its
really
quite
unique
and
interesting
only
as
it
warms
and
you
progress
through
the
glass
does
the
spicing
really
appear
so
pretty
damned
drinkable
beer
is
clear
but
if
not
careful
the
yeast
will
dislodge
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
the
last
sips
will
be
yeasty
overall
the
beer
is
well
balance
especially
when
you
consider
the
high
abv
10
5
it
finishes
a
little
dry
but
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
come
through
im
not
sure
what
i
expected
from
a
beer
made
with
yams
but
it
was
pretty
good
i
dont
pick
up
much
of
the
maple
character
but
im
not
sure
how
much
i
should
good
beer
interesting
check
it
out
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
the
fall
the
beer
creates
a
perfect
equation
for
fall
and
winter
all
you
need
is
autumn
maplefriendsa
firexcold
weather
and
you
will
be
sure
to
have
a
good
time
poured
a
leather
brown
with
a
huge
head
from
good
carbonation
that
dies
slowly
an
intense
smell
of
cinnamon
clove
peppers
the
spices
in
this
beer
outweight
the
smell
of
yams
and
there
is
some
minor
sweetness
in
the
smell
of
maple
and
molasses
and
also
a
little
yeast
smell
the
sweetness
from
the
yams
and
maple
is
evident
but
the
spices
mostly
cinnamon
and
clove
is
what
i
am
picking
up
is
just
a
tad
too
powerful
a
fullbodied
beer
that
is
thick
sticky
and
smooth
and
finishes
slightly
dry
due
to
a
minor
citric
hop
bite
on
the
backend
could
also
be
a
very
minor
abv
burn
a
very
good
if
not
great
beer
that
is
pleasing
to
sip
on
and
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
only
wish
it
couldve
been
a
little
sweeter
drinkability
definitely
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
on
a
cold
winter
night
it
smells
like
a
pumpkin
ale
but
tastes
like
a
belgian
brown
im
not
really
sure
how
to
best
classify
it
my
nose
says
one
thing
and
my
tastebuds
say
another
its
a
beer
i
definitely
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
and
i
might
pick
up
another
one
for
when
the
weather
cools
i
like
pumpkin
ales
and
especially
the
imperial
variety
so
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
and
a
terrific
fall
seasonal
d
quite
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
one
of
my
new
favorite
fall
seasonals
its
a
little
too
carbonated
i
think
and
comes
across
just
a
touch
too
thin
overall
a
very
fine
brew
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
the
bruery
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
exceeded
expectations
as
im
not
a
big
pumpkin
guy
and
the
amount
of
it
in
this
beer
is
why
i
like
this
so
much
there
is
so
much
more
going
on
in
this
beer
the
10
is
very
high
so
splitting
a
bottle
with
a
like
minded
friend
is
the
way
to
go
im
going
to
pick
up
some
bottles
for
thanksgiving
its
sort
of
a
no
brainer
the
bruery
is
doing
big
thangs
for
such
a
young
bruery
as
far
as
fall
offerings
go
this
guy
has
a
rich
and
unique
character
that
goes
a
really
long
way
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
now
so
what
better
time
to
try
it
than
the
first
day
of
fall
decanted
in
to
a
tulip
glass
head
rises
very
quickly
to
produce
three
fingers
worth
color
is
a
murky
maple
orangebrown
mix
heading
is
slow
to
fade
and
does
not
leave
residue
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
spicy
nose
full
of
cinnamon
and
clove
along
with
some
nutmeg
and
light
pumpkin
spice
funny
that
none
of
the
ingredients
mentioned
on
the
label
i
can
pick
up
in
the
smell
taste
is
a
different
story
as
the
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
really
show
up
the
yams
i
wish
i
could
taste
but
i
think
the
fact
that
i
have
never
had
yams
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
i
also
get
a
slight
hint
of
juicy
fruit
in
the
taste
which
may
be
a
result
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
speaking
of
the
alcohol
it
really
works
with
this
beer
in
that
it
can
be
felt
and
tasted
but
it
complements
many
of
the
flavors
all
of
the
spices
really
give
your
palate
a
full
slide
show
of
tastes
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
will
need
to
get
another
bottle
or
two
while
they
are
still
around
as
this
might
be
the
perfect
beer
for
this
season
next
time
i
pop
one
of
these
i
will
make
sure
i
am
in
the
middle
of
some
real
boston
fall
weather
so
that
the
experience
is
all
the
more
appropriate
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
the
bruery
large
bottle
wo
any
freshness
info
pours
dark
brown
and
murky
dark
khaki
head
moderate
collar
and
fairly
minor
spotty
lacing
spiced
up
nose
with
sweet

and

also
coming
to
the
party
thanksgiving
spices
sweat
potatos
pumpkin
plenty
of
dark
and
sweet
malts
floating
around
rich
sweet
nice
for
fall
warming
and
tasty
perhaps
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
still
a
nice
fall
offering
from
bruery
has
thanksgiving
dinner
desserts
written
all
over
it
recommended
music
pairing
wilco
being
there
i
bought
the
barrelaged
version
in
a
bottle
as
well
so
i
cant
wait
to
compare
the
two
i
understand
that
for
the
most
part
ba
exhibits
similar
characteristics
to
harvard
in
the
grade
inflation
department
personally
ive
been
trained
to
see
a
b
rating
and
i
think
holy
crap
this
is
yet
another
beer
that
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
then
one
small
glass
at
a
sitting

the

like

i

the

brew
this

is
what
it
is
they
advertise
a
brown

with
raspberries
and
this
is
exactly
what
that
is
its
nothing
crazy
but
its
solid
theres
a
touch
of
a
fake

flavor

the
flavoring
is
nicely

and

love
raspberries

the

well
carbonated
with
a

the
flavor
profile
is
where
this
ale
shines
intense
raspberry
with
a
subtle
underlying
biscuit
sweetness
that
never
becomes
prominent
enough
to
balance
the
tart
raspberry
it
never
hits
the
puckering
stage
but
the
effervescence
maintains
a
prickly
tartness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
somewhat
crisp
and
leaves
you
with
a
tart
raspberry
flavor
this
one
avoids
the
sickeningly
sweet
fault
of
many
raspberry
ales
as
this
beer
is
billed
as
a
raspberry
brown
ale
i
expected
something
quite
a
bit
darker
richer
and
different
this
strikes
me
as
a
standard
raspberry
beer
that
is
similar
to
but
in
no
way
comparable
to
the
raspberry
beers
produced
by
new
glarus
and
founders
the
bottle
says
this
is
a
big
luscious
celebration
of
raspberries
while
luscious
is
not
the
word
i
would
employ
to
describe
this
beer
it
was
fairly
enjoyable
and
refreshing
and
would
make
a
nice
summer
beer
unfortunately
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
to
it
at
least
not
the
flavors
i
would
look
for
in
a
beer
like
this
i
wont
buy
this
again
and
if
someone
gives
it
to
me
i
think
ill
try
mixing
it
with
something
an
interesting
light
raspberry
frambozen
its
either
bad
beer
or
good
cough
medicine
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
this
style
but
even
so
this
beer
underperforms
for
the
category
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
enjoyable
a
light
beer
for
the
cooler
weather
overall
a
surprisingly
tasty
beer
which
may
seem
like
a
gimmick
at
first
but
make
no
mistake
this
beer
is
extremely
refined
wellcrafted
and
dangerously
drinkable
at
its
abv
an
outstanding
offering
that
just
feels
right
on
a
cold
winters
night
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
brown
ale
very
fruity
sweet
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
for
whatever
it
is
they
were
going
for
o
the
raspberry
flavor
is
pleasant
and
slightly
tart
there
is
not
much
complexity
and
the
body
is
pretty
weak
its
an
enjoyable
fruit
beer
with
a
light
thin
face
o
not
much
left
to
remind
you
of
a
brown
ale
raspberry
really
takes
over
but
im
not
complaining
i
could
drink
this
all
day
real
nice
mellow
fruit
beer
nothing
fancy
just
real
simple
drinkable
and
flavorful
the
feel
is
crisp
up
front
with
a
little
less
on
the
end
the
semidry
to
dry
medium
body
pretty
much
the
same
its
well
carbonated
and
maybe
moderately
smooth
when
i
hear
the
word
frambozen
even
though
im
familiar
with
its
flemish
origins
back
in
my
native
tongue
all
my
feeble
brain
gets
is
frozen
raspberry
from
a
sense
of
place
and
rudimentary
french
knowledge
anyways
a
nicely
fruity
brownish
ale
the
balance
evident
after
more
than
a
few
mere
sips
overall
a
pretty
decent
take
on
a
fruit
beer
sweet
and
jammy
but
not
sickly
sweet
nice
chocolate
malt
flavor
comes
through
after
the
fruit
o
though
theres
certainly
not
a
lot
of
complexity
here
it
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
give
a
nice
fruity
snap
of
sweetness
along
with
the
malty
balance
i
liked
it
even
though
it
was
5
mos
past
its
best
buy
date
i
think
it
will
taste
of
more
berries
if
it
were
fresh
i
learned
my
lesson
even
if
my
beer
cellar
is
organized
that
doesnt
mean
my
fridge
is
ugg
if
you
are
going
to
invest
in
a
fruit
type
of
beer
i
think
it
best
to
stick
with
lambics
or
belgian
styles
that
are
conducive
to
fruit
in
general
otoo
much
raspberries
too
sweet
nothing
else
to
this
beer
if
you
absolutely
love
raspberries
give
it
a
whirl
but
not
much
of
a
reason
otherwise
o
this
is
interesting
but

overall
this

good
balance

robustness
of
raspberry
darkbready

and
earthy
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
when
i
saw
this
was
a
raspberry
brown
ale
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
a
light
american
oud
bruin
but
turns
out
its
just
a
regular
englishamerican
brown
ale
with
raspberries
none
of
the
flavors
are
very
full
and
its
a
pretty
watery
beer
nothing
really
off
putting
to
me
just
kind
of
weak
and
not
too
sure
fruit
works
with
this
style
the
raspberry
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
many
are
and
its
not
heavy
enough
to
be
offensive
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
35
and
foamy
25
mouthfeel
that
suits
this
raspberry
brown
ale
just
fine
closes
dry
with
light
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
overall
perfect
if
you
hate
beer
or
anything
that
tastes
anything
like
beer
overall
like
a
few
of
new
belgium
beers
i
love
the
idea
but
it
doesnt
fall
quite
where
i
want
it
othis
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
my
favorite
the
combination
of
raspberry
syrup
flavor
and
toastednutty
malts
make
for
a
somewhat
odd
pair
in
the
doses
used
here
more
malty
sweetness
might
help
balance
the
raspberry
and
give
the
beer
a
better
profile
the
light
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bit
out
of
place
and
more
body
would
make
this
brown
go
down
better
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
good
example
of
a
raspberry
brown
ale
and
i
think
it
could
still
pass
as
a
decent
example
of
a
fruit
beer
since
the
raspberry
is
nice
and
noticeable
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
a
holiday
dinner
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
i
thought
it
was
pretty
perfect
and
neither
the
brown
ale
base
or
the
raspberry
were
too
overpowering
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
wished
it
was
brown
ale
like
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
for
sure
get
some
next
year
and
im
sure
ill
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
before
they
are
all
gone
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
raspberry
beers
or
anybody
who
thinks
that
a
raspberry
brown
ale
sounds
good
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
very
solid
and
it
had
great
balance
good
job
new
belgium
thanks
for
another
good
beer
that
somehow
managed
to
fly
under
my
radar
mouth
a
little
thin
but
not
atypical
of
a
brown
ale
could
potentially
benefit
from
additional
body
clean
and
dry
it
leaves
little
lingering
besides
a
slight
fruit
tartness
overall
something
about
this
beer
just
makes
me
happy
that
it
is
christmas
season
has
a
special
little
place
in
my
heart
and
i
could
drink
these
all
season
overall
not
bad
for
a
seemingly
low
end
fruit
beer
not
amazing
but
definitely
above
average
i
would
definitely
give
this
a
try
and
could
even
see
myself
buying
it
again
that
is
not
something
i
say
about
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
years
frambozen
had
it
the
past
two
winters
and
it
was
excellent
both
times
seems
to
be
watered
down
this
year
nonetheless
it
is
still
easy
drinking
and
has
been
growing
on
me
the
more
i
drink
it
just
doesnt
stack
up
with
the
previous
years
this
beer
was
released
o
decent
but
nothing
special
unfortunately
the
raspberry
smells
and
tastes
artificial
i
like
the
combination
of
the
chocolate
with
the
raspberry
though
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
coloration
fair
head
and
some
strong
lacing
nose
is
at
really
good
malt
and
fruit
combination
very
wellbalanced
flavor
is
lightly
malted
and
lightly
fruity
neither
aspect
overwhelming
the
other
well
done
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff

to
folks
during
the
holiday
season
it
would
make
a
great
dessert
compliment
to
a
dark
chocolate
cake
or
mousse
or
all
by
itself

a

ruby
red
color
with
a
pale
pink
112
finger
head
that
leaves
a
nice
pink
lace
down
the
glass
chasing
the
deep
red
brew
the
nice
aroma
of
crisp
raspberries
is
dominant
as
should
be
in
this
beer
along
with
a
mild
vanilla
background
so
far
and
a
distinct
alcohol
note
goes
down
to
a
thin
lace
i
must
say
with
the
exception
of
a
fruit
lambic
would
be
great
for
pairing
with
chocolate
maybe
a
fourth
of
a
finger
that
is
all
i
can
say
the
maltiness
is
very
sturdy
hints
of
malt
one
of
the
worst
beers
imo
deelish
these
go
down
so
smooth
and
so
yummy
would
make
a
great
summer
session
ive
always
liked
the
up
front
big
flavor
on
this
brew
havent
had
it
in
a
long
time
i
did
manage
to
finish
one
but
the
other
5
bottles
were
donated
to
the
highlife
drinking
college
kids
down
the
street
different
a
yellow
gold
in
color
light
lacing
s
very
strong
orange
with
maybe
a
splash
of
vanilla
t
strong
orange
taste
almost
like
orange
crush
soda
hit
of
wonder
bread
in
there
m
thin
and
bitter
a
bite
in
the
back
of
the
throat
o
smelled
delicious
and
went
in
with
high
hopes
couldnt
let
it
sit
in
the
mouth
very
long
a
little
too
sweet
i
think
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
slightly
sweet
but
doable
refreshing
but
sort
of
bitter
its
smells
like
a
creamsicle
with
a
dry
orange
peely
taste
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
but
i
would
prefer
a
shandy
this
just
simply
comes
down
to
preference
when
it
comes
down
to
a
fruity
beer
i
would
prefer
a
lemon
to
an
orange
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
something
i
would
buy
a
lot
of
rjt
this
one
is
definitely
more
floral
wow
i
really
had
grand
hopes
on
this
but
was
seriously
disappointing
kind
of
mediocre
not
terrible
but
watery
and
artificial
tasting
not
so
bad
that
i
regret
having
it
but
theres
no
real
reason
to
have
this
o
i
like
this
one
its
not
too
complicated
to
enjoy
but
is
different
enough
to
be
distinguished
from
a
lot
of
the
other
summer
offerings
they
took
a
rather
oddball
flavour
idea
and
made
something
pleasant
out
of
it
unlike
some
of
the
other
oddball
flavours
ive
tried
this
year
if
i
can
get
it
regularly
this
will
be
one
of
my
summer
favourites
overall
i
wish
i
would
have
just
looked
at
the
prior
ratings
and
avoided
this
one
aroma
is
a
perfumey
orangewater
scent
rather
sweet
well
quite
sweet
for
a
light
beer
not
exactly
malty
quite
fruity
and
bittertart
just
like
oranges
with
the
peel
its
actually
not
a
bad
orange
flavor
there
is
just
something
too
much
like
candy
about
this
i
would
not
want
to
drink
a
pint
but
its
hard
to
fault
the
general
beeriness
of
it
lets
hope
they
never
make
a
malt
liquor
based
on
this
stuff
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
ralphs
supermarket
in
san
clemente
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
orange
zest
and
yeast
there
is
a
slight
vomitlike
smell
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
much
the
same
with
yeast
and
citrusy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
drinks
better
cold
and
gets
worse
as
it
warms
up
o
it
doesnt
smell
like
beer
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
yellowgold
with
a
big
white
head
consisting
of
large
bubbles
that
dissipate
down
to
nothing
aroma
is
light
orange
like
orange
blossom
scented
soap
and
mineral
water
taste
comes
across
as
fizzy
orange
flavored
mineral
water
almost
sodalike
but
the
flavor
is
muted
and
a
bit
soapy
not
bad
but
i
will
not
seek
this
out
not
much
beer
taste
going
on
here
overall
this
beer
sounded
interesting
and
thats
why
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
found
this
brew
in
a
sample
pack
from
wm
crisp
amazing
nose
the
orange
is
present
but
not
dominant
follows
up
at
the
end
for
a
nice
finish
have
only
tasted
a
handfull
of
times
but
had
to
put
in
a
special
order
for
when
lent
is
over
what
the
hell
was
i
thinking
giving
up
beer
o
i
can
see
what
they
are
going
for
here
the
orange
cream
taste
although
artificial
tasting
isnt
that
bad
i
just
see
no
traces
of
beer
flavors
this
is
something
my
wife
would
probably
like
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
one
of
if
not
the
worst
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
my
words
dont
accurately
describe
my
revulsion
a
total
drain
pour
avoid
o
overall
an
unremarkable
beer
certainly
not
bad
but
not
worth
having
again
either
wont
seek
out
and
would
drink
again
but
id
definitely
look
for
something
better
first
overall
i
was
thinking
this
would
be
fun
and
i
like
to
cut
loose
once
in
awhile
but
boy
this
is
so
watered
down
and
flattened
its
like
drinking
watered
down
tang
andor
orange
koolaid
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
beer
and
it
doesnt
even
deliver
from
what
is
sensed
on
the
nose
at
all
it
says
brewed
with
natural
flavor
could
have
fooled
me
tastes
anything
but
poured
out
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
faint
fizz
rim
and
a
very
strong
hybrid
aroma
of
orange
crush
soda
and
yeasty
dough
with
just
a
smidge
of
vanilla
aroma
in
the
background
not
really
sure
i
dig
the
smell
of
bread
crammed
into
orange
soda
its
the
yeast
smell
in
particular
that
seems
to
clash
the
flavor
and
texture
resembles
a
thinner
wheat
beer
with
a
significant
cooked
sort
of
canned
vegetal
orange
flavor
which
also
clashes
for
my
palate
against
the
base
beer
at
least
the
carbonation
is
adequate
unfortunately
the
body
is
too
thin
and
watery
i
probably
wont
be
visiting
this
one
ever
again
not
a
real
fan
of
it
not
a
horrible
beer
but
definitely
somewhat
worse
than
mediocre
served
from
bottle
into
a
sweetwater
snifter
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
instantly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
orange
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cream
orange
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
average
brew
nothing
really
stood
out
on
this
one
at
all
for
me
from
other
brews
of
the
same
style
there
are
so
many
good
brews
in
this
style
it
would
be
hard
to
do
so
but
this
one
felt
like
it
didnt
even
make
an
effort
yes
the
orange
was
there
yes
the
cream
was
there
but
thats
it
i
guess
you
cant
win
them
all
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
tick
it
but
doubt
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
again
i
mean
this
was
just
okay
there
isnt
anything
disgusting
about
it
i
was
able
to
finish
the
glass
as
it
warmed
though
this
started
to
turn
for
the
worse
nothing
id
reach
for
again
but
if
you
want
an
extremely
orangeforward
beer
this
would
be
one
to
try
has
a
slight
creamy
mouth
feel
with
nice
orange
notes
not
too
overwhelming
or
sweet
and
a
lively
carbonation
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
overall
falls
a
little
flat
not
bad
but
not
exciting
it
becomes
a
little
too
sweet
mid
way
through
and
needs
some
bitterness
to
rein
it
in
this
beer
is
so
thin
that
you
could
drink
it
very
easily
but
the
flavor
keeps
me
from
returning
to
it
serving
type
bottle
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tall
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
straw
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
orange
soda
not
what
i
am
expecting
of
a
beer
tastes
of
bland
grain
with
some
fake
orange
flavor
not
really
that
great
the
beer
is
quite
fizzy
for
its
light
body
although
it
finishes
well
overall
a
below
average
beer
overall
drinkable
but
like
cream
ales
ingeneral
you
like
them
or
you
dont
in
this
case
the
orange
could
sway
you
one
way
or
the
other
depending
on
your
palate
really
not
too
bad
a
beer
but
isnt
much
better
than
a
stella
or
blue
moon
and
has
the
misfortune
of
costing
more
either
go
for
a
cheaper
macrobrew
or
find
a
better
comparably
priced
apa
which
should
be
easy
either
way
pass
on
this
one
o
a
very
inconsistent
beer
ive
had
worse
fruit
beers
but
ive
definitely
had
better
a
clear
orange
yellow
pour
with
a
slight
amount
of
head
which
quickly
diminished
smells
of
bayer
childrens
aspirintictac
orange
flavoring
tastes
like
said
aspirin
dropped
in
seltzer
and
wheat
bread
light
bodied
mildly
carbonated
this
is
a
decent
fruit
beer
a
lot
like
orange
flavored
seltzer
honestly
which
i
like
but
not
in
a
beer
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
just
is
fairly
forgettable
and
more
or
less
unimpressive
this
beer
kind
of
defines
the
phrase
it
is
what
it
is
overall
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
its
definitely
something
different
and
that
to
me
is
always
welcome
in
this
business
it
is
a
super
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
has
me
welcoming
the
summers
heat
its
nice
to
see
a
springsummer
time
beer
that
can
be
refreshing
but
doesnt
fall
back
on
the
old
standby
citrus
o
not
much
changes
from
first
sniff
to
final
drop
o
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
if
it
was
the
only
decent
thing
to
choose
from
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
otherwise
this
is
not
a
good
beer
not
as
ridiculous
of
a
fruit
bomb
as
lost
coast
tangerine
wheat
but
thats
not
saying
much
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
smell
is
of
orange
peel
hard
to
tell
its
a
beer
the
taste
begins
with
a
bitter
orange
peel
start
followed
by
a
burst
of
citrus
sweetness
that
fades
away
quickly
into
nothingness
a
bit
of
yeast
character
in
there
light
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
too
high
overall
an
ok
beer
interesting
but
i
doubt
i
will
get
this
again
i
think
that
ill
stick
to
cooking
with
this
one
overall
drinkability
great
light
refreshing
beer
interesting
and
unorthodox
offering
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
despite
its
lightness
o
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
an
interesting
and
unique
ale
the
orangecitruslemon
flavor
was
done
pretty
well
but
isnt
the
beer
flavors
that
i
enjoy
the
most
id
still
recommend
trying
it
just
because
you
dont
see
these
flavors
done
often
with
beer
i
tasted
it
while
standing
over
the
sink
but
was
drawn
back
to
the
recliner
by
the
pleasant
surprise
a
light
orange
honey
taste
pleases
the
mouth
is
it
great
no
but
it
begs
for
another
sip
this
one
pours
a
very
light
and
watery
bright
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
white
lacing
that
quickly
died
it
smells
of
a
diet
orange
soda
plain
and
simple
it
may
smell
somewhat
artificial
but
it
is
appealing
mostly
because
of
the
spritzy
sweetness
the
flavor
is
fresh
fruity
floral
and
it
has
some
light
honey
as
well
it
again
is
heavy
on
the
diet
soda
it
drinks
watery
and
very
light
its
probably
one
of
the
lightest
beers
around
overall
this
is
a
solid
cream
ale
but
a
little
artifical
girls
would
like
this
d
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
typical
lighter
fruity
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
almost
cringe
when
i
see
screwtops
but
the
beer
was
definitely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
just
the
slightest
of
haze
aromas
of
orange
cream
coda
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
ugh
yeah
this
tastes
like
an
orange
cream
soda
with
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
thin
body
with
prickly
carbonation
this
is
nasty
basically
an
orange
soda
avoid
hazy
gold
with
a
small
white
head
which
lasted
about
30
seconds
leaving
a
small
ring
no
lacing
so
far
smell
is
orange
and
citrus
oils
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
from
the
modest
hopping
malts
are
plentiful
and
slightly
grainy
a
good
cream
ale
base
that
is
enhanced
or
ruined
by
the
generous
orange
citrus
flavors
the
label
says
ale
brewed
with
honey
orange
peel
natural
flavors
and
orange
flower
extract
added
i
think
i
can
taste
them
all
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
a
cream
ale
perhaps
a
bit
overly
carbonated
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
well
crafted
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
brewed
by
pyramid
brewing
co
for
buffalo
bills
brewery
somewhere
on
the
west
coast
a
tasty
and
refreshing
summer
beer
though
probably
one
would
be
enough
o
heres
the
tricky
part
as
pedestrian
as
it
is
the
alluring
sweet
orange
blossom
scent
is
such
a
very
arresting
quality
that
i
think
it
was
responsible
for
my
enjoying
this
brew
more
than
it
perhaps
deserved
o
fairly
balanced
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
simple
but
to
the
point
an
ale
brewed
with
honey
and
orange
peel
is
exactly
what
you
get
these
seem
highly
sessionable
but
i
personally
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
them
the
flavors
seem
like
they
can
get
rather
cloying
after
a
while
not
bad
not
good
this
beer
isnt
something
that
most
people
would
go
for
its
too
sweet
for
most
beer
lovers
id
say
however
i
was
to
say
that
i
like
it
the
pour
is
a
little
boring
fizzy
white
head
with
a
near
clear
yellow
body
typical
look
to
this
beer
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
orange
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
creamy
orange
with
just
some
malt
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
light
kind
of
airy
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
was
ok
in
my
eyes
because
i
like
the
sweetness
from
time
to
time
id
never
want
to
have
a
bunch
of
these
at
one
time
but
just
a
starter
or
finisher
would
be
perfect
m
the
creaminess
was
a
little
off
putting
it
might
be
typical
of
the
style
i
dont
know
but
i
didnt
go
for
it
too
much
the
brothers
and
i
never
seem
to
agree
oh
well
poured
from
a
bottle
a
nice
orangegold
color
nice
thick
foamy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
like
a
brilliant
dark
bold
creamsicle
the
taste
was
exellent
with
a
nice
milky
mouthfeel
with
orange
florals
and
nice
light
grains
wonderful
for
me
this
will
become
a
summer
staple
o
meh
ive
seen
this
beer
countless
times
at
the
store
and
though
its
gotta
be
better
than
it
sounds
well
i
was
wrong
this
is
more
flat
soda
than
it
is
fruit
beer
if
malty
wine
cooler
is
your
thing
give
it
a
try
otherwise
avoid
o
overall
an
average
beer
with
some
very
light
nice
orange
in
the
nose
and
taste
a
better
alternative
to
bmc
products
though
i
didnt
really
see
it
as
a
fruitvegetable
beer
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
not
awful
t
lots
of
orange
along
with
some
lemon
and
a
bit
of
grain
on
the
finish
this
is
labeled
a
cream
ale
but
had
no
evidence
of
actually
being
one
the
mouthfeel
was
about
as
creamy
as
an
original
bud
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
pabst
set
that
seeks
to
cheat
on
their
signature
hipster
beer
good
beer
to
give
someone
instead
of
a
screwdriver
without
the
punch
overall
this
is
an
outlier
for
the
fruit
beer
style
as
it
is
overly
orange
flavored
and
uses
artificial
flavoring
that
said
my
wife
enjoys
it
taste
is
like
what
i
imagine
an
orange
peel
dipped
in
cheap
vanilla
ice
cream
would
taste
like
i
love
orange
dreamsicles
and
comparing
this
beer
to
them
is
doing
the
frozen
treat
a
disservice
this
is
thin
pithy
sweet
and
overly
fizzy
seems
like
a
good
idea
gone
wrong
glad
this
was
only
a
single
i
would
have
a
tough
time
finishing
a
whole
sixer
of
it
o
i
was
very
dissapointed
in
this
beer
i
wanted
to
like
it
it
would
make
a
great
introduction
to
a
person
just
getting
into
craft
beer
starting
off
with
mild
bitter
flavors
but
i
can
not
buy
this
again
overall
a
great
thirst
quencher
with
no
real
bitterness
and
mild
enough
for
light
meals
and
deserts
or
to
be
savored
by
itself
sweet
and
sophisticated
probably
favored
by
the
ladies
light
zesty
beer
good
for
a
hot
season
d
overall
pretty
drinkable
its
a
medium
abv
beer
with
refreshing
orange
flavors
and
not
too
bitter
or
sweet
i
liked
it
nice
job
o
good
summer
drinker
since
im
makin
some
pasta
i
might
as
well
have
a
beer
right
this
one
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
orange
zest
wheat
red
apple
flesh
very
light
white
grape
and
sweet
honey
this
fruit
salad
comes
off
almost
fakely
sweet
and
fruity
as
though
im
smelling
some
sort
of
air
freshener
or
something
instead
of
a
beer
the
taste
brings
in
everything
above
along
with
some
sweet
flowers
and
a
touch
of
grass
these
new
earthier
elements
dont
really
help
much
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fizzy
watery
feel
overall
i
cannot
say
in
any
way
that
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
its
not
necessarily
rotten
but
its
nowhere
near
good
either
o
has
more
of
a
soda
flavor
than
i
would
expect
definitely
has
that
artificial
creme
sicle
taste
to
it
its
not
terrible
but
falls
in
line
with
all
the
other
over
fruit
flavored
ales
pass
on
this
overall
the
one
thing
that
i
didnt
appreciate
was
that
there
was
no
information
or
ingredient
list
on
this
beer
they
just
had
the
style
beer
name
brewer
abvs
and
other
useless
info
on
the
side
i
enjoyed
this
beer
even
though
it
was
much
different
than
i
thought
it
would
be
wont
be
going
back
to
anytime
soon
and
really
wouldnt
promote
this
one
doesnt
really
taste
very
beerlike
but
it
served
my
purpose
its
a
good
summery
beer
for
the
hottest
day
of
the
year
so
far
overall
it
was
ok
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
again
overall
meh
its
a
candy
orange
soda
creamsicle
bleh
wouldnt
be
bad
as
a
mixed
drink
or
something
but
not
a
beer
saw
this
in
a
beer
mag
at
the
grocer
bought
a
single
at
famouscloudyabsolutely
no
headmade
me
suspect
slight
citrus
odor
and
a
little
yeasty
light
noncarbonated
mouth
feel
orangey
middle
mouthmurky
mung
at
the
bottom
drank
it
anyway
fruit
and
beer
i
dont
get
it
splain
it
to
me
pours
crystal
clear
with
thin
white
soda
style
head
nose
smells
very
sweet
like
sunny
delight
crisp
yet
watery
body
tastes
like
orange
and
ccream
soda
probably
great
at
a
bbq
but
right
now
its
meh
pours
a
golden
yellow
i
was
expecting
a
cloudier
look
the
smell
is
hard
to
peg
there
is
deffinately
a
orangish
odor
but
there
is
something
else
there
like
other
citrus
smells
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
the
tase
is
a
orangish
sweetness
there
is
a
strange
after
taste
over
all
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
makes
me
want
to
taste
others
from
buffalo
bills
overall
not
recommended
light
gold
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
dissolves
right
away
much
more
a
lager
in
appearance
than
an
ale
smells
of
cream
orange
candy
and
florals
also
has
a
very
orange
candy
flavor
honey
and
floral
notes
are
also
noticeable
not
totally
unpleasant
to
drink
providing
you
only
want
one
its
way
too
sweet
to
take
any
deeper
than
that
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
orange
citrus
and
somewhat
dry
in
the
taste
orange
citrus
and
notes
of
wheat
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
light
dry
orange
peel
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
sweet
with
some
dry
clove
and
honey
hints
quite
pedestrian
o
overall
it
was
a
fun
drinkable
beer
there
isnt
really
a
competitor
to
compare
it
to
so
i
can
safely
say
its
a
great
orange
cream
soda
beer
and
its
definitely
worth
a
try
kind
of
deceptive
i
got
it
hoping
for
a
cream
ale
but
its
not
that
at
all
it
is
rather
a
basic
fruit
beer
pours
honey
golden
with
almost
no
head
a
bit
fizzy
a
taste
of
nearly
sickeningly
sweet
orange
pretty
much
dominates
all
refreshing
though
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
as
opposed
to
that
of
a
crisp
witbier
not
too
bad
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
it
sounded
like
an
interesting
buy
it
isnt
all
that
bad
its
a
cloudy
dishwater
colored
brew
with
low
carbonation
the
aroma
is
fruity
but
seems
artificial
the
taste
is
like
they
tried
to
infuse
a
heffeweizen
with
fruit
and
put
more
of
an
emphasis
on
the
fruit
the
taste
is
also
seemingly
artificial
fruit
but
its
tolerable
despite
the
initial
bitterness
it
has
a
light
tartness
that
lingers
but
stays
fairly
smooth
it
goes
good
with
taco
pizza
o
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
as
its
unlike
anything
ive
really
had
before
but
dont
expect
it
to
blow
your
mind
notes
interesting
beer
not
bad
or
good
but
interesting
taste
like
orange
cream
soda
and
not
a
bad
one
but
it
isnt
really
what
i
want
in
a
beer
for
what
it
is
or
if
you
are
wanting
something
like
orange
cream
soda
it
is
nice
but
outside
that
its
nothing
worth
getting
o
draino
very
disappointed
not
even
close
to
what
i
had
hoped
for
overall
this
is
a
decent
above
average
beer
that
i
might
drink
once
in
awhile
if
you
love
orange
pop
this
beer
is
a
must
try
but
for
everyone
else
you
might
want
to
skip
this
one
appearance
is
an
orange
amber
with
a
very
thin
dissapating
head
and
no
lace
smell
has
a
zest
of
orange
taste
reminds
me
of
a
very
watered
down
sunkist
orange
soda
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
refreshing
its
something
that
would
go
good
on
a
hot
summers
eve
if
you
like
orange
soda
this
is
the
beer
for
you
if
not
than
dont
try
not
impressed
with
this
drink
but
glad
i
tried
it
overall
this
is
not
a
good
beer
not
sure
that
i
would
even
call
it
a
beer
as
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
any
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
a
description
of
the
beer
indicated
that
it
tastes
like
a
creamcicle
if
that
were
the
case
i
think
i
would
somewhat
enjoy
this
beer
overall
the
beer
tastes
of
unbalanced
orange
water
with
a
bad
beer
aftertaste
oif
served
ice
cold
in
sweltering
summer
heat
i
guess
i
can
see
someone
swirling
this
down
but
it
wont
be
us
pretty
much
novelty
beer
not
bad
just
not
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golen
amber
with
a
quick
diminishing
head
citrus
scents
are
very
evident
here
has
a
rather
strong
orange
flavor
as
youd
expect
from
the
name
finishes
will
an
awkward
after
tatsetexture
that
is
hard
to
describe
definetly
has
a
lot
more
texture
to
it
than
you
normal
citrus
beers
like
blue
moon
or
bud
golden
wheat
which
must
be
where
the
cream
part
comes
in
rather
drinkable
and
delicious
but
also
forgetable
pours
pale
yellow
with
no
real
head
except
thin
white
around
the
edges
of
the
drink
orange
cola
honey
in
the
nose
its
a
ploy
that
works
the
artificial
aroma
does
invite
me
in
for
a
sip
orange
cola
cream
floral
notes
light
citrus
skins
and
slight
hop
dryness
towards
the
finish
is
covered
up
by
a
buttery
orange
note
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
touristy
beer
hey
take
a
picture
im
drinking
craft
d
this
is
an
ok
brew
for
someone
looking
for
an
alternative
to
craft
beer
itself
strangely
enough
my
girlfriend
who
four
nights
ago
said
nugget
nectar
was
amazing
also
said
this
is
so
i
dont
know
maybe
this
is
a
good
brew
for
some
and
most
not
others
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
consume
and
would
probably
be
good
on
a
hot
day
tried
it
as
part
of
a
make
your
own
six
pack
and
i
am
sure
if
fruit
beers
are
your
thing
you
would
probably
enjoy
a
few
id
have
another
if
someone
offered
me
one
but
would
not
purchase
again
d
this
beer
looked
and
sounded
interesting
but
ultimately
fell
flat
imo
best
part
of
the
beer
was
its
highly
carbonated
appearance
but
thats
not
saying
much
taste
was
almost
unbearable
will
not
look
for
again
overall
this
isnt
a
really
good
beer
should
be
avoidedk
ive
never
heard
of
anyone
talk
about
this
beer
before
and
now
i
know
why
d
would
not
pick
this
up
again
but
if
you
like
sodasmixed
drinks
and
are
not
a
beer
drinker
this
could
be
for
you
drinks
like
imitation
i
have
to
give
it
to
buffalo
bills
the
name
orange
blossom
cream
ale
pretty
perfectly
captures
the
flavors
of
this
brew
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
real
and
the
synthetic
quality
becomes
grating
near
the
end
of
the
glass
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
taste
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
d
as
good
as
this
is
its
more
of
a
dessert
beer
and
i
would
have
one
and
then
move
on
with
that
said
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
a
mandarin
orange
asian
salad
and
some
salmon
as
i
think
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
to
have
with
this
or
some
sweeter
chinese
dish
give
it
a
try
anyways
d
overall
i
loved
the
blueberry
and
sort
of
liked
the
pumpkin
not
enough
spice
but
this
buffalo
bill
offering
seemed
lacking
would
pick
up
a
sixer
but
their
really
are
better
beers
with
not
only
more
flavor
but
a
higher
abv
as
well
and
of
course
taste
more
like
beer
pass
borderline
malternativethe
orange
cream
soda
flavor
is
just
too
much
and
it
tastes
sort
of
diet
at
that
youd
be
better
served
by
just
buying
an
orange
cream
soda
and
dropping
a
splash
of
vodka
in
it
im
surprised
with
the
low
scores
on
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
at
13
a
six
pack
it
was
a
little
pricey
but
a
nice
fresh
citrus
taste
with
no
off
flavors
that
i
can
taste
a
smooth
beer
with
just
the
smallest
amount
of
cloudiness
seems
like
an
awesome
beer
for
drinking
in
the
summer
drinkability
fairly
poor
taste
is
reminiscent
of
orangeflavored
vitamin
c
packs
mixed
in
water
you
could
certainly
throw
back
a
bunch
of
these
and
it
would
be
easy
to
convince
a
bud
light
limemiller
chill
to
try
this
as
a
betterbuilt
but
3
times
pricier
alternative
i
think
its
weird
that
this
says
its
a
winter
beer
at
the
top
of
this
page
seems
more
summer
to
me
which
is
why
i
grabbed
it
originally
for
me
it
just
seemed
a
bit
too
artificial
watered
down
though
im
sure
there
are
worse
things
i
could
have
used
to
finish
this
mixer
sixer
from
kroger
i
think
id
rather
go
back
to
the
nonalcoholic
drink
i
got
at
the
cash
register
diet
orange
crush
heh
this
is
the
first
of
nine
summer
brews
in
a
gift
pack
i
received
from
my
neighbors
for
letting
them
use
the
pool
this
summer
it
was
a
nice
thought
i
had
never
tried
eight
of
the
nine
drinkability
its
an
interesting
flavor
id
personally
like
to
taste
more
of
the
orange
peel
would
make
for
a
decent
summer
ale
subtle
aftertaste
makes
it
easy
to
come
back
for
more
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
the
whole
time
it
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
orange
glo
cleaner
or
something
d
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
a
winter
beer
i
totally
see
this
is
a
summer
beer
because
its
highly
refreshing
and
due
to
it
being
slightly
watery
and
only
a
5
2
abv
its
very
drinkable
d
i
came
home
after
walking
3
miles
in
100
degree
weather
and
cracked
one
of
these
opened
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
was
actually
very
refreshing
from
experience
this
would
be
a
good
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
my
first
sampling
of
this
style
whatever
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
like
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
example
of
it
less
bitter
orange
and
more
richness
and
sweetness
would
be
my
suggestion
drinkability
pretty
low
its
something
to
drink
but
not
something
a
seasoned
ba
would
seek
out
ok
based
on
its
label
and
from
the
sounds
of
it
youd
think
youd
be
in
for
a
unique
one
of
a
kind
beer
well
youd
be
wrong
this
beer
is
pretty
bad
the
taste
is
horrendous
it
leaves
a
bitter
taste
in
your
mouth
and
honestly
you
could
never
chug
one
of
these
these
12
oz
beers
are
so
bitter
it
takes
me
upwards
of
up
to
20
minutes
to
drink
one
beer
also
buffalo
bills
seasonal
pumpkin
ale
is
just
as
bad
sort
of
a
clear
gold
color
to
it
with
a
puffy
head
smells
lusciously
of
orange
taste
is
intensely
of
wheat
and
finishes
with
orange
almost
like
an
orange
muffin
goes
down
smooth
and
crisp
pretty
drinkable
too
and
low
alcohol
count
which
is
a
plus
has
a
very
floral
taste
with
a
bitter
orange
tang
its
too
much
on
the
orange
peel
tho
gives
it
a
soapy
flavor
id
prefer
it
to
be
more
citrus
juice
than
peel
it
gives
it
an
unpleasant
taste
up
front
the
actual
form
of
the
ale
is
pretty
good
it
has
alot
of
depth
to
it
complex
hop
flavor
within
however
like
i
said
too
much
orange
peel
makes
this
unpleasant
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
you
better
like
oranges
it
just
got
a
bit
tiring
toward
the
end
d
this
is
where
i
simply
state
that
i
love
to
drink
this
beer
it
might
not
be
the
manliest
or
beeriest
beverage
but
damn
is
it
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
orange
flavor
is
much
more
adult
than
what
you
might
expect
orange
crush
this
aint
this
beer
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
summer
the
bottles
i
bought
were
marked
5
2
abv
and
were
twistys
as
opposed
to
the
ba
photo
could
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
pyramid
appears
to
be
contract
brewing
it
for
the
brewpub
or
may
have
acquired
the
recipe
all
together
ah
the
old
shell
game
eh
magic
hat
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
not
overly
sweet
or
overloaded
with
fruit
flavor
well
balanced
would
pick
up
a
six
every
now
and
then
in
the
warmer
months
and
the
wife
likes
it
weak
head
bland
yellow
color
smells
like
genny
cream
with
orange
flavoring
the
orange
flavor
is
nicely
done
though
behind
there
just
seems
to
be
a
mediocre
at
best
beer
but
the
orange
is
the
point
so
it
is
fairly
well
done
in
that
regard
very
drinkable
especially
as
a
summer
refreshment
d
very
novel
and
nothing
offensive
a
nice
fruit
beer
hmmm
i
wonder
why
this
has
received
such
a
poor
reviewing
since
it
is
enjoyable
and
refreshing
in
short
the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
nice
carb
uprising
and
a
head
that
starts
foamy
and
receedes
to
a
thin
lasting
coat
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
light
orange
peel
and
pilsner
flavor
is
slightly
lacking
although
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
much
more
since
if
it
were
any
heavier
it
would
turn
me
off
this
is
a
summer
beer
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
great
for
what
this
is
instead
of
being
syrupy
it
is
light
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
this
beer
benefits
from
not
being
overdone
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
oranges
it
smells
a
lot
like
orange
tang
the
flavor
is
oranges
with
some
light
tartness
and
a
little
bit
of
cream
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
thought
that
this
beer
was
ok
not
something
i
would
go
out
and
buy
for
good
beer
at
least
but
good
on
hot
summer
days
picnics
and
get
togethers
with
especially
non
beer
drinkers
ill
never
buy
it
again
d
good
for
an
afternoon
in
the
sun
this
brew
is
not
over
the
top
so
put
down
many
is
easy
a
nice
rendition
for
the
style
md
thin
bodied
heavy
carbonation
like
mentioned
before
it
tasted
and
felt
like
i
was
drinking
an
all
natural
orange
soda
interesting
but
not
my
thing
drinkability
no
thank
you
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
it
was
a
good
summer
beer
and
had
some
nice
citrusy
flavor
to
it
i
would
drink
it
again
the
orange
blossom
cream
ale
from
buffalo
brewery
is
an
average
beer
with
an
average
price
its
not
overly
done
and
not
to
complex
and
the
price
reflects
it
i
dont
think
this
beer
was
created
to
deliver
overly
complex
flavors
and
complexity
but
rather
to
appeal
to
a
broad
spectrum
of
people
to
enjoy
drinkability
its
like
a
less
fizzy
less
sweet
sunkist
orange
soda
but
with
alcohol
its
okay
and
refreshing
enough
to
warrant
a
single
bottle
but
not
really
for
me
d
great
hot
weather
beer
but
the
flavor
is
so
pronounced
im
not
sure
i
would
be
willing
to
tip
6
of
these
in
a
row
i
will
be
going
back
for
a
second
so
it
is
not
too
overpowering
its
a
very
full
bodied
beer
and
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
few
in
one
sitting
atmosphere
is
okay
appearance
is
pretty
average
and
the
nose
is
very
singular
flavor
is
a
little
synthetic
and
orange
is
really
the
only
thing
you
can
taste
not
strongly
but
its
a
grainy
orange
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
dm
very
crisp
beer
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
carbonated
decent
summer
beer
to
give
a
try
d
halfgone
and
the
rest
is
headed
for
deepsix
down
the
drain
just
not
even
tolerable
for
several
of
us
who
have
tried
to
struggle
with
it
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
purchased
from
als
of
hampden
golden
beer
with
14
inch
of
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
very
light
lacing
smells
like
i
just
peeled
an
orange
disappointingly
weak
orange
taste
with
very
sweet
aftertaste
smooth
and
very
creamy
feel
to
this
one
did
not
meet
me
high
expectations
i
had
going
in
reminded
me
of
a
coors
light
with
an
orange
squeezed
into
it
would
not
recommend
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
orange
cream
taste
is
good
lots
of
orange
flavor
that
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
buffalo
bills
orange
blossom
cream
ale
is
a
hazy
pale
golden
ale
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
and
perfumy
orange
blossom
and
sweet
orange
candy
like
tang
or
orange
koolaid
and
a
slight
whiff
of
adjuncts
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
thats
very
soft
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
finish
it
leaves
the
teeth
slightly
gritty
it
tastes
like
herbal
tea
its
very
orange
flavored
at
first
it
seems
very
sweet
but
it
gets
balanced
out
with
a
little
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
malt
flavor
tries
to
stay
out
of
the
way
but
it
tastes
a
little
grainy
and
a
little
corny
its
a
little
over
the
top
but
its
a
fun
beer
and
it
goes
down
with
little
resistance
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
head
literally
disappears
after
seconds
smells
like
beer
and
orange
taste
kind
of
watered
down
not
as
much
orange
as
i
was
expecting
from
the
other
reviews
but
its
definitely
present
sweet
kind
of
like
hic
at
first
then
mellows
out
to
a
normal
beer
taste
thin
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
however
if
you
wanna
throw
back
a
bunch
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
do
it
with
overall
not
the
worst
ive
had
could
have
been
a
lot
worse
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
light
but
flavorful
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
aroma
is
clearly
orange
even
my
wife
who
isnt
an
alcohol
drinker
of
any
kind
liked
the
smell
the
hops
are
delicate
and
the
malt
subdued
but
the
overall
experience
is
pleasant
the
taste
follows
the
nose
well
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
some
orange
tartness
and
emerging
creaminess
help
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
yet
also
quite
smooth
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
for
the
spring
and
summer
not
sure
of
the
complete
availability
though
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
maybe
if
i
were
hosting
a
party
for
college
girls
i
got
too
much
of
an
orange
slice
taste
and
smell
from
this
brew
i
think
a
little
more
body
a
little
less
carbonation
would
not
only
improve
on
the
taste
and
feel
but
also
might
cut
back
on
the
overwhelming
smell
of
oranges
extremely
light
and
overly
carbonated
it
feels
like
a
wine
spritzer
extremely
disappointing
brew
pretty
much
tastes
like
natural
light
meets
orange
crush
to
me
pours
a
pale
orange
color
some
goldlike
hilights
slightly
off
white
head
chunky
foam
to
start
then
down
to
a
thin
cap
uneven
lacing
on
the
glass
some
orange
or
citrus
aroma
kind
of
sugary
sweet
no
hops
or
other
smells
detected
flavor
has
some
more
citrus
orange
peel
more
on
the
sweet
side
sugary
sweet
rather
than
malt
sweetness
body
is
light
quite
carbonated
slight
oily
mouthfeel
interesting
cocept
was
expecting
fuller
body
and
mouthfeel
cream
ale
but
the
orange
blossom
was
apparent
maybe
two
but
no
more
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
not
something
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
in
one
sitting
but
its
pleasant
different
refreshing
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
mini
snifter
vibrant
orange
with
about
2
inches
of
head
lots
of
small
carbonated
bubbles
tastes
like
orange
sunkist
orange
soda
no
real
ale
flavor
profile
to
report
here
major
disappointment
i
suppose
this
would
be
highly
chugable
on
a
hot
day
other
than
that
i
would
stay
away
appears
a
pale
orange
tinted
gold
with
a
nice
vibrant
semi
clear
body
with
slightly
off
white
thick
chunky
head
some
thin
uneven
lacing
sticks
around
as
it
dwindles
aromatics
give
off
strong
orange
peel
some
sugar
coated
notes
as
well
with
the
citrus
outweighing
any
evidence
of
minimal
hops
utilitized
smells
of
oxiclean
orange
scented
products
of
info
merical
heyday
with
a
floral
herbal
note
in
the
background
flavor
wise
the
strong
herbal
tea
leafiness
with
the
citrus
orange
peel
additions
with
a
light
creamed
corn
sweetness
are
evident
its
been
around
a
long
time
so
somebody
is
drinking
it
but
definitely
not
a
regular
for
my
dbf
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
on
the
palate
with
a
slight
oily
texture
from
the
orange
peels
finish
is
somewhat
medicinal
but
ill
take
that
drinkability
overall
isnt
great
id
much
rather
drink
a
pils
if
im
going
for
a
lighter
beer
or
a
well
done
hefe
weizen
versus
this
style
drinkable
to
a
degree
nice
one
but
two
may
be
pushing
it
d
ok
this
is
a
hard
one
it
is
not
like
beer
at
all
more
like
a
wine
cooler
the
aftertaste
is
very
wine
cooler
like
you
could
drink
a
load
of
these
but
why
would
you
if
your
looking
for
beer
d
this
is
a
hybrid
between
an
adjunct
lager
and
a
fruity
malt
beverage
if
youre
looking
for
some
fizzy
sugary
orange
juicebeer
this
is
it
a
half
drainpour
essentially
in
case
the
point
wasnt
made
this
is
an
unsweetened
orange
soda
its
almost
an
orange
tea
in
seltzer
a
sympathetic
rater
could
give
this
an
okay
score
but
a
beer
purist
will
not
i
suppose
im
somewhere
in
between
drinkability
not
an
overpowering
alcohol
taste
but
you
definitely
know
its
there
wouldnt
really
drink
this
one
again
i
was
expecting
a
more
pleasant
orange
taste
but
it
tasted
more
like
orange
pop
mixed
into
a
beer
d
defiantly
worth
a
try
good
as
a
dessert
the
orange
flavor
simply
doesnt
taste
natural
and
there
are
absolutely
no
other
beer
elements
involved
in
the
taste
hops
barley
yeast
etc
to
really
satisfy
as
a
beer
overall
a
decent
orangey
brew
here
would
i
have
more
than
one
probably
not
i
tried
this
beer
with
a
bit
of
apprehension
it
came
as
part
of
a
set
of
summer
brews
i
found
at
the
world
market
center
any
beer
that
lists
a
fruit
normally
keeps
me
away
so
i
was
kind
of
surprised
this
one
wasnt
that
bad
while
the
beer
had
a
orange
beersoda
look
to
it
i
was
surprised
it
didnt
have
a
real
orange
smell
to
it
it
didnt
have
a
big
orange
taste
either
it
did
have
a
kind
of
fizzy
quality
to
it
when
drinking
but
mostly
a
crisp
easy
to
drink
beer
while
i
may
never
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
a
6
pack
if
handed
one
id
drink
it
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
really
good
soda
different
and
worth
trying
but
i
am
glad
i
only
bought
one
d
between
the
harsh
sodalike
carbonation
bite
and
the
citrusy
zest
its
a
good
summer
beer
for
anyone
that
likes
berry
weiss
i
thought
id
finish
it
but
when
it
came
to
the
last
two
gulps
i
asked
myself
why
bother
drinks
pretty
well
sometimes
the
spice
makes
it
rough
in
spots
d
i
cant
do
it
i
enjoy
cream
ales
i
enjoy
oranges
but
not
the
rind
debating
whether
or
not
to
give
it
the
dump
and
move
on
not
the
first
cream
ale
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
best
color
is
murky
and
light
orange
smell
and
taste
a
bit
muddled
together
with
some
vanilla
bean
and
yeasty
orange
with
a
sodalike
carbonation
very
light
and
way
too
sweet
does
not
finish
particularly
well

this

the

flavor
lingers
on

well
after

swallow
this
is

on

scale
since
the
orange
flavors
are

quite
an
odd
brew
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
white
head
that
had
no
intention
of
sticking
around
very
strong
aroma
of
oranges
supported
with
some
hints
of
malt
the
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
is
way
too
carbonated
it
reminded
me
of
drinking
orange
soda
flavors
of
sweet
orange
and
honey
dominate
the
front
some
malt
flavors
begin
to
emerge
midway
through
finish
is
pretty
nondescript
not
overly
complex
and
nonoffensive
if
you
like
orange
flavor
this
would
be
a
great
summer
refresher
silly
brewmaster
oranges
are
for
juice
pours
a
clear
pale
burnt
orange
with
a
white
sodatype
head
that
disappeared
rapidly
the
smell
is
a
bold
orange
aroma
backed
by
a
light
roasted
malt
with
not
much
else
but
still
enticing
the
taste
is
very
much
like
a
very
watered
down
orange
soda
with
only
a
hint
of
any
malt
or
hops
at
all
it
is
a
very
light
bodied
brew
that
finishes
lightly
sweet
now
that
description
said
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
its
as
if
the
flavor
is
so
faint
yet
so
smooth
with
almost
zero
evidence
of
alcohol
you
just
drink
like
gatorade
on
a
hot
day
i
have
mixed
emotions
on
this
one
perhaps
i
need
to
try
this
again
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
odd
interesting
and
unique
cheers
this
would
be
a
nice
diversion
on
a
hot
day
the
color
was
a
clear
medium
golden
yellow
and
very
little
to
no
foam
what
so
ever
the
smell
had
just
a
slight
aroma
of
orange
blossoms
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
had
an
orange
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
sour
aftertaste
on
the
palate
although
it
had
an
orange
taste
this
was
a
weak
beer
with
no
creamyness
at
all
a
good
beer
if
you
like
an
orange
flavor
pours
a
dull
copper
zilch
for
a
head
smell
of
fresh
oranges
malts
very
fruity
up
front
a
blast
of
orange
peels
dominate
the
palate
maybe
some
honey
and
lemonzesty
notes
the
orange
malty
body
becomes
creamy
true
to
the
name
slightly
carbonated
other
than
you
guessed
the
orange
peel
this
is
pretty
much
a
onesided
brew
tastes
resemble
an
orange
soda
or
orange
hard
candy
for
the
style
not
too
shabby
just
cant
see
craving
this
one
much
a
change
of
pace
though
i
was
unable
to
finish
this
bottle
i
just
cant
take
the
weird
cleanser
smell
good
luck
if
you
decide
to
try
it
pours
a
very
light
color
and
leaves
a
small
white
head
smells
of
sweet
honey
and
probably
obviously
oranges
im
expecting
some
powerfull
fruit
tones
in
this
brew
the
first
taste
i
encouter
was
oranges
lots
of
them
followed
by
a
sweet
honey
taste
that
sweetens
out
the
brew
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
bitter
almost
but
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
probably
one
of
the
better
fruitybrews
ive
had
easy
going
down
with
a
not
too
sweet
taste
pretty
nice
job
on
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
slight
orange
tint
and
a
short
white
fizzy
head
that
soon
vanishes
completely
nose
is
sweet
malt
and
fresh
grain
with
a
faint
trace
of
orange
zest
definitely
less
orange
aroma
than
i
was
expecting
moderate
in
body
with
a
spritzy
texture
and
rather
sharp
carbonation
taste
remains
fairly
constant
throughout
the
tasting
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
honey
balanced
by
bitter
citrus
oils
and
orange
peel
would
make
for
a
nice
springtime
brew
a
friend
brought
this
over
and
so
i
decided
to
try
a
bottle
it
poured
a
copper
color
and
formed
a
white
head
that
left
some
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
orange
peel
with
some
other
citrus
present
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
flavor
was
of
orange
and
honey
with
a
slight
malt
aspect
the
finish
has
a
sour
aspect
that
really
hurt
the
beer
strange
fruit
im
not
sure
what
the
intention
or
the
market
focus
is
for
this
one
the
beer
looks
okclean
golden
color
with
a
slightly
above
average
bit
of
lace
and
considerable
stick
my
problem
is
with
the
rest
of
the
drink
the
nose
is
more
akin
to
a
soda
than
a
beer
it
lacks
any
finesse
or
restraint
and
seems
to
be
trying
to
appeal
to
the
folks
who
dont
really
like
beer
but
want
to
be
drinking
one
with
the
rest
of
the
gangkind
of
like
a
white
zinfandel
of
the
beer
world
the
flavors
are
candied
orange
and
then
cloying
malt
that
come
off
in
a
sweet
and
sour
sort
of
way
that
to
me
just
doesnt
work
the
more
ya
drink
the
less
you
want
this
is
an
easy
to
put
down
brewand
i
mean
down
the
drain
overall
a
good
and
very
different
beer
experience
id
recommend
it
just
on
the
novelty
value
alone
this
would
be
great
on
a
spring
or
summer
afternoon
out
on
the
back
porch
listening
to
the
lawn
mowers
in
the
distance
while
the
baseball
game
winds
along
on
the
radio
try
it
if
you
see
it
sort
of
drinkable
it
is
mild
and
different
not
an
all
night
beer
but
a
good
orange
beer
its
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
quickly
sweet
orange
aroma
very
similar
to
orange
peel
its
quite
fun
to
smell
it
actually
and
a
touch
of
honey
is
in
there
too
fizzy
carbonation
makes
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
odd
and
a
bit
like
soda
orange
peel
dominates
the
flavor
honey
is
in
there
a
bit
and
adds
a
certain
smoothness
its
an
interesting
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
aftertaste
is
quite
annoying
kind
of
like
chewing
on
an
orange
peel
this
aftertaste
alone
knocks
down
drinkability
and
taste
an
odd
beer
here
drinkabilitynotes
very
nice
and
quite
drinkable
although
better
suited
to
warm
weather
than
cold
it
would
be
excellent
on
a
hot
summer
day
my
fiancée
liked
this
very
much
i
suspect
that
women
who
are
less
than
enthused
with
beer
might
enjoy
this
beer
instead
of
an
alcopop
malt
beverage
conclusion
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
but
pretty
tasty
the
best
way
to
drink
this
in
my
opinion
is
moderately
cold
with
a
slice
of
fresh
orange
thrown
in
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
new
favorite
but
i
would
buy
it
again
the
only
think
i
dont
get
is
if
there
is
an
actual
buffalo
bills
brewery
since
this
beer
is
contracted
out
to
portland

fresh

but
a

than

is
the
dominant
aroma
it
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
my
fingers
after
i
use
them
to
break
open
a
sweet
orange
taste
a
very
refreshing
creamy
flavor
that
has
both
the
sweetness
and
tang
of
orange
fruit
the
orange
flavor
lasts
a
while
after
the
the
swallow
very
drinkable
i
first
tried
this
a
few
months
ago
and
i
keep
returning
to
it
on
a
once
in
a
while
basis
its
not
a
remarkable
beer
but
it
is
just
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
would
really
like
to
try
it
on
a
hot
day
or
a
warm
evening
this
was
a
tough
one
for
me
to
decide
on
ratings
the
brew
is
an
exceptionally
clear
goldenorange
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
small
rapidly
diminished
white
head
smells
and
tastes
like
some
good
orange
cream
sodas
ive
had
in
that
respect
i
liked
it
but
i
didnt
feel
like
i
was
drinking
beer
i
cant
deny
that
its
good
though
but
id
probably
enjoy
it
more
on
a
summer
afternoon
than
i
do
right
now
watching
the
snow
fall
an
interesting
brew
was
looking
for
the
typical
winter
seasonal
but
came
accross
this
and
thought
id
give
it
a
try
since
i
like
their
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
big
head
made
of
large
bubbles
that
soon
dissapates
to
nothingm
though
the
beer
stays
carbonated
as
expected
it
has
an
orange
aroma
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
but
that
is
about
it
the
taste
is
light
ub
flavor
with
a
orange
cream
flavor
that
follows
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
feel
that
it
is
lacking
a
little
an
unusual
beer
but
not
to
badthough
i
would
be
pushed
to
drink
more
than
two
bottles
overall
a
nice
and
tasty
brew
that
has
a
great
level
of
darker
fruit
flavor
all
while
not
being
obnoxious
in
sweetness
this
is
a
rather
pleasant
drinker
and
a
well
crafted
fruit
beer
overall
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
the
flavor
and
carbonation
combo
is
knockout
like
a
chchchchchchchchcherry
bomb
that
being
said
theres
not
a
whole
lot
that
makes
me
think
beer
when
i
drink
this
apart
from
the
yeasty
aftertaste
but
im
somehow
still
very
entranced
by
the
flavor
and
aroma
qualities
a
great
choice
for
when
you
want
a
beer
but
dont
want
a
beer
at
the
same
time
if
that
makes
sense
in
a
nutshell
fun
and
uncomplicated
rjt
o
right
there
with
new
glarus
fruit
beers
and
that
is
saying
something
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
like
commonly
available
kriek
beers
in
the
us
a
bit
pricey
but
a
treat
good
for
an
occasional
shake
up
super
sweet
didnt
taste
like
beer
really
tasted
more
or
less
like
grenadine
tried
this
one
tonight
according
to
the
description
that
is
found
on
the
beer
menu
it
was
definitely
described
correctly
deep
ruby
in
color
but
mouthfeel
was
lacking
body
cherry
taste
was
most
evident
and
pleasurable
decent
lacing
in
the
flight
glass
it
was
lacking
in
some
areas
but
i
was
pleased
in
others
great
dessert
beer
all
around
nice
for
other
people
not
my
type
of
beer
i
really
dislike
a
strong
sweet
cherry
flavor
hence
the
lower
flavor
scorei
grabbed
this
by
mistake
but
it
had
a
great
mouth
feel
great
color
all
in
all
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
again
just
not
my
cup
of
brew
the
cherry
cranberry
juice
takes
things
over
in
the
flavor
but
there
is
still
a
hint
of
toasted
biscuit
malts
to
balance
that
tart
fruitiness
out
tart
finish
has
a
winelike
feel
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
it
is
fruity
yes
but
it
still
acts
like
a
beer
o
it
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
cherry
wheat
very
one
not
with
not
a
lot
of
complexity
cherry
flavor
is
better
than
it
smells
but
it
does
get
cloying
after
awhile
id
give
it
a
5
if
it
was
up
against
any
other
cherry
beer
its
best
in
its
class
this
is
a
beer
i
can
use
as
a
gateway
drug
for
wine
drinkers
while
other
beers
in
the
fruitlambic
arena
are
more
akin
to
wine
coolers
this
has
some
of
the
deep
richness
of
a
sweet
deep
red
wine
the
cherry
flavor
mixing
with
the
donker
makes
for
an
excellently
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
the
fact
that
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
unlike
many
lambics
or
perrys
where
my
palate
needs
a
break
is
a
testimony
to
its
good
balance
and
flavor
it
is
a
great
balance
of
the
tart
with
the
sweet
the
malt
and
deep
flavors
of
the
beer
seem
to
yield
to
the
natural
great
tasting
flavor
of
dark
red
cherries
the
flavour
seems
to
be
a
bit
divisive
you
either
love
it
or
loathe
it
me
i
love
it
and
if
you
like
cherry
beers
then
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
at
least
try
this
not
a
beer
that
you
slam
but
one
you
sip
cherry
notes
are
prominent
and
the
sweetness
is
not
overbearing
excellent
special
occasion
beer
happy
i
was
able
to
partake
i
believe
this
is
a
bit
underrated
previously
and
would
certainly
recommend
to
anyone
with
a
sweet
tooth
for
their
beers
and
very
welcome
surprise
well
that
is
yuck
this
is
so
deeply
fruity
with
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
but
balanced
by
the
tart
finish
rich
but
light
bodied
attractive
red
amber
color
with
a
finegrained
and
longlasting
foam
zingy
on
the
tongue
with
just
a
nice
acidity
like
real
fruit
overall
plenty
of
cherries
but
enough
of
everything
else
to
keep
the
drinker
occupied
the
light
tartness
really
adds
some
authentic
flavors
which
keep
this
from
being
overly
sweet
flavour
not
to
my
liking
wasnt
expecting
that
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
aroma
is
a
biscuit
and
cherries
the
flavor
is
fullbodied
with
a
nice
cherry
sour
element
extremely
wellbalanced
with
the
8
abv
thoroughly
hidden
the
beer
flavor
is
subtle
but
definitely
present
with
a
faint
hop
element
in
the
aftertaste
you
have
to
enjoy
cherries
to
appreciate
this
beer
but
its
outstanding
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
bottle
from
world
of
beer
as
a
carryout
pours
dark
deep
red
colored
with
a
finger
of
pink
head
that
recedes
quickly
cherry
boquet
off
the
top
of
this
one
slightly
tart
but
mostly
black
sweet
ones
a
bit
of
cranberry
note
very
fruity
and
not
much
else
going
on
though
its
nice
if
youre
a
fan
of
cherries
flavor
is
a
big
punch
of
black
cherries
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
or
malt
or
yeast
or
sourness
here
basically
black
cherry
juice
with
some
carbonation
nevertheless
this
isnt
extremely
overly
sweet
and
is
somewhat
pleasant
as
a
dessert
beer
medium
bodied
with
plus
carbonation
that
keeps
things
from
being
super
syrupy
overall
worth
having
if
in
the
mood
for
cherries
the
thing
that
sticks
out
to
me
here
is
that
it
comes
with
huge
black
cherry
flavor
but
without
the
medicinal
cough
syrup
notes
that
can
often
be
associated
with
that
no
not
really
for
me
the
huge
raspberry
flavor
in
the
aroma
and
taste
really
come
across
as
more
cough
syrup
like
than
anything
not
very
drinkable
had
to
sip
slowly
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
beer
other
than
that
fruity
flavor
that
overpowers
everything
else
a
little
alcohol
bitterness
and
some
metallic
aftertaste
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
body
has
a
delicious
cherry
smell
and
the
flavor
is
of
strong
cherry
syrup
very
solid
beer
but
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
at
once
if
you
like
fruity
beers
and
are
not
in
to
hoppy
beers
you
might
find
this
very
yummy
the
best
thing
i
can
say
is
that
ounce
for
ounce
it
is
cheaper
than
cherry
cough
medicine
the
cherry
is
cloyingly
sweet
there
is
a
light
tartness
that
is
insufficient
for
balancing
sweetness
there
is
a
bitter
medicinal
aftertaste
is
this
sweetness
artificial
is
that
where
the
bitterness
is
coming
from
disappointing
o
first
time
for
this
beer
and
it
is
quite
an
experience
was
expecting
a
slightly
tart
cherry
belgian
ale
and
get
a
cherry
lifesaver
like
i
said
this
being
my
first
experience
and
with
2
years
on
it
not
sure
how
accurate
this
review
will
be
for
some
people
who
get
it
fresh
i
got
this
for
1
50
and
didnt
check
the
bottled
on
date
oops
good
after
dinner
drink
o
i
intend
to
buy
a
few
bottles
to
throw
in
the
cellar
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
not
overly
complex
but
definitely
a
delicious
brew
id
love
to
have
a
few
bottles
in
my
cellar
if
you
ever
tried
domestic
sour
cherry
liqueur
this
is
what
beer
taste
like
and
smells
also
sharpa
bit
sweet
refreshing
and
strong
unlike
liqueur
not
sticky
and
feeling
on
tongue
last
shorter
very
good
after
desserts
especially
cakes
and
pies
besides
cherries
slight
amount
of
wood
pine
and
earth
can
be
felt
food
pair
drink
as
a
dessert
with
vanilla
ice
cream
or
drink
as
aperitif
drinking
it
will
make
you
hungry
im
a
sucker
for
a
cherry
beer
and
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
cherry
bomb
one
dimensional
but
delicious
would
buy
again
not
the
ideal
color
for
ale
strong
cherry
flavor
up
front
but
a
bit
of
a
mucky
aftertaste
really
tough
to
match
this
one
up
with
foods
either
this
was
one
of
the
least
enjoyed
red
ales
ive
had
id
stick
with
a
kriek
lambic
like
timmermans
in
the
future
o
this
is
zima
with
a
doubleshot
of
cherry
cough
syrup
ive
had
a
really
good
sour
beer
with
cherries
before
so
cherries
arent
the
problem
its
the
fact
that
this
is
simply
not
a
good
beer
pretty
much
a
drain
pour
very
assertive
beer
it
is
all
about
cherries
cherries
and
i
almost
forgot
cherries
o
good
light
sour
a
little
too
syruplike
3
5
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
had
it
with
cheese
and
it
makes
a
nice
complement
poured
into
a
rastel
goblet
excellent
head
with
large
bubbles
a
bit
of
a
champagne
feel
to
the
pour
very
effervescent
in
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
dark
rubygarnet
color
smell
is
good
very
sweet
a
hint
of
jolly
rancher
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
very
refreshing
and
tangy
taste
is
sweet
but
balanced
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
a
good
changeup
or
after
dinner
beer
very
enjoyable
but
not
one
to
have
everyday
draught
sharpedge
creekhouse
served
in
a
great
kasteel
chalice
this
one
pours
a
dark
ruby
tinged
brown
color
there
was
a
wisp
of
a
tan
head
that
left
some
lacing
it
has
a
nice
nose
some
cherries
and
some
sweet
caramel
malts
some
other
fruits
hiding
down
in
there
the
flavor
is
very
nice
cherries
on
top
a
hint
of
tingling
on
the
tongue
good
malt
body
with
some
sweetness
a
touch
of
chocolate
also
i
wouldnt
sit
down
and
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
overall
drinkability
i
feel
that
the
beer
is
the
vehicle
that
carries
and
showcases
the
cherries
and
allows
the
cherry
flavor
to
be
the
main
highlight
but
not
be
too
much
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
doubt
i
would
ever
know
this
was
8
abv
unless
i
had
looked
it
up
prior
to
drinking
it
a
very
nice
beer
showcasing
cherries
that
being
said
i
cannot
have
more
than
one
its
good
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
my
palate
is
tired
and
wants
something
else
if
the
belgian
ale
underneath
could
come
out
more
and
play
with
the
cherries
then
youd
have
something
really
amazing
here
glad
i
tried
it
but
at
the
price
here
in
the
us
doubt
i
would
get
it
again
o
cherry
cherry
and
some
more
cherry
deceptive
wouldnt
want
too
many
could
be
ruinous
o
this
was
after
the
apperance
a
nice
surprise
merely
okay
in
the
world
of
beers
certainly
below
the
high
standard
which
belgium
cranks
out
might
be
something
to
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
which
tastes
little
like
beer
if
so
i
prefer
quelque
chose
o
a
very
good
fruit
beer
something
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
and
to
be
honest
as
good
as
it
was
a
bomber
of
this
was
just
a
little
much
a
11
2
oz
would
be
perfect
medium
bodied
synthetic
candied
mouthfeel
a
little
cloying
on
the
finish
that
was
a
little
better
but
im
not
a
fan
of
either
to
the
point
need
i
say
it
again
cherry
i
think
i
am
drinking
a
cherry
cola
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
even
on
bottle
of
this
half
way
thru
and
i
am
taking
this
glass
to
my
wife
if
you
like
cherry
flavored
colas
this
would
be
perfect
for
you
o
very
different
than
anything
ive
ever
had
before
its
worth
trying
just
for
the
experience
but
i
wouldnt
make
this
a
go
to
beer
for
me
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
overall
strong
cherry
dominance
hides
the
alcohol
would
serve
well
as
a
dessertwinter
holiday
beer
blow
b
o
tastes
a
good
bit
better
than
it
smells
but
still
not
very
good
awesome
cough
syrup
but
lousy
beer
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
or
drink
them
very
often
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
with
some
dark
chocolates
very
straightforward
cherry
beer
recommended
if
youre
willing
to
accept
that
this
is
in
no
way
close
to
a
traditional
kriek
and
just
want
a
cherry
bomb
overall
i
may
drink
this
beer
again
but
only
in
limited
quantities
i
would
compare
it
to
dessert
wine
because
it
is
good
in
small
quantities
but
too
rich
to
drink
it
all
the
overall
effect
in
the
hot
thai
climate
in
which
i
enjoyed
this
was
quite
refreshing
something
that
most
belgians
are
not
able
to
do
theres
a
bit
of
fizz
and
a
light
feel
to
the
beer
overall
which
works
for
hot
weather
i
am
not
sure
that
this
would
be
a
good
session
drink
seemed
to
me
this
is
great
as
a
one
off
but
i
am
not
inclined
to
write
it
off
as
such
i
am
intrigued
and
will
be
indulging
again
soon
for
sure
yes
this
was
strong
but
it
needed
the
booze
to
give
it
some
oomph
while
not
as
sour
as
a
lambic
or
light
as
most
other
beers
that
fell
under
this
category
this
certainly
was
a
fruit
beer
that
was
almost
good
enough
to
stand
up
as
a
dessert
unto
itself
it
fell
just
a
bit
short
because
the
artificial
aspect
was
too
pronounced
here
but
even
with
that
being
said
this
can
be
enjoyed
just
on
its
own
and
would
pair
nicely
with
something
like
a
cheesecake
that
could
add
some
depth
and
sweetness
to
this
slightlymild
brew
this
beer
was
great
after
having
a
good
meal
opened
a
bottle
of
this
as
a
dessert
the
pour
was
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
looking
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
cherries
were
pretty
impressive
mixed
with
a
little
funk
and
some
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
has
just
a
bit
of
tartness
to
it
from
the
cherries
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pretty
refreshing
has
a
good
amount
of
lively
carbonation
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
quite
good
worthy
of
checking
out
my
grandma
would
love
this
this
beer
was
a
hit
with
my
girlfriend
that
does
not
like
beer
i
gave
it
to
her
to
finish
overall
it
delivers
what
was
promised
liquid
dessert
absolutely
delicious
i
love
cherries
and
i
loved
this
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
tart
awesome
review
2300
kind
of
like
how
when
you
were
18
you
thought
youd
be
dead
by
the
time
you
were
30
o
this
beer
can
be
considered
one
dimensional
but
its
a
nice
one
to
enjoy
if
you
like
cherries
this
would
make
for
a
nice
selection
if
you
want
something
fruity
but
is
a
lot
heavier
compared
to
a
lambic
overall
nice
sweet
and
tart
notes
some
sour
notes
and
oak
flavors
too
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
tight
fizzy
carbonation
a
bit
softer
than
soda
but
the
flavors
would
make
you
think
you
were
drinking
one
no
sight
of
the
8
0
nice
flavorful
fruit
beer
not
a
fun
of
fruity
beers
unless
if
its
a
hot
day
and
i
want
something
to
quench
my
thirst
and
even
then
most
probably
i
will
go
for
a
lager
but
anyway
this
is
very
drinkable
and
made
me
realize
there
are
good
fruit
beers
out
there
o
too
sweet
and
syrupy
to
my
taste
fruit
beers
i
prefer
the
drier
ones
like
cantillons
or
3fonteinens
i
do
not
recommend
this
one
overall
very
good
beer
goes
well
with
meals
the
poor
is
pretty
good
a
light
tan
head
on
the
beer
is
kind
of
underwhelming
for
the
sweet
cherry
aroma
that
is
there
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
maroon
color
the
taste
is
glorious
its
as
if
god
picked
cherries
and
placed
them
in
your
mouth
this
is
how
a
fruit
beer
should
taste
it
has
a
long
finish
the
goodness
stays
with
you
for
the
night
overall
a
very
drinkable
fruit
beer
ill
get
it
again
nice
fruit
ale
with
a
little
too
much
of
that
cough
syrup
flavor
still
rich
but
tart
a
little
heavy
on
the
sweetness
overall
a
good
fruit
beer
but
i
prefer
fruit
beers
where
the
fruit
flavor
is
stronger
and
isnt
competing
with
too
many
other
flavors
i
suppose
i
should
appreciate
complexity
but
for
some
reason
i
dont
when
it
comes
to
fruit
beers
theres
something
about
the
exact
mix
of
flavors
here
that
just
didnt
quite
work
for
me
ill
likely
revisit
this
one
again
someday
o
this
reminds
me
of
ng
belgian
red
in
its
syrupy
cherry
flavor
not
my
favorite
but
i
can
appreciate
the
style
every
once
in
a
while

smell
is
not

pleasant
i
can
somewhat
smell
the
base
brown
beer
under
it
all
but
the
main
thing
i
pick
up
is
sugar
and
cough
syrup
the
taste
where
do
i
begin
this
tastes
like
straight
up
cherry
cough
syrup
with
a
hint
of
maraschino
cherries
theres
a
touch
of
tartness
in
the
finish
but
its
not
enough
to
fix
this
mess
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
could
use
more
carbonation
this
is
so
gross
not
drinkable
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
wish
i
would
have
opened
it
up
over
the
summer
when
it
was
warmer
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
this
is
really
a
guzzler
i
really
need
to
seek
out
some
more
krieks
and
see
how
this
stacks
up
pours
a
murky
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
lots
of
dark
cherry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
medicinal
cherry
flavor
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
a
quick
story
if
you
find
it
in
your
hearts
to
give
me
the
time
to
tell
it
i
may
be
a
bit
jaded
when
it
comes
to
what
i
believe
is
a
quality
beer
and
have
succumbed
to
the
hype
of
certain
styles
of
brew
over
the
years
i
also
succumbed
to
a
62
czech
but
that
is
another
tale
or
tail
i
would
never
in
my
life
take
a
sip
of
a
damn
fruity
beer
and
the
thought
of
adding
fruit
was
a
novelty
meant
for
punier
men
than
me
i
have
been
proven
wrong
tonight
my
friends
for
tonight
i
have
been
exposed
to
the
greatness
that
is
kasteel
rouge
a
cherry
bomb
that
destroys
your
mouth
but
in
the
most
respectable
manner
a
hidden
jewel
in
the
temple
that
is
the
belgian
beer
empire
this
type
of
beer
was
always
something
foreign
to
me
like
a
black
girl
she
may
have
beautiful
features
but
you
think
that
there
must
be
something
different
going
on
you
are
hesitant
to
make
a
move
you
remember
what
your
friend
once
said
they
are
spicy
you
wonder
what
the
heck
this
spicy
taste
thing
is
all
about
and
keep
your
distance
but
also
keep
a
fixation
one
day
you
invite
the
girl
back
to
your
house
and
finally
kiss
her
she
tastes
the
same
as
everybody
else
but
you
only
let
her
give
you
a
handjob
in
the
end
this
is
kasteel
rouge
a
gem
in
disguise
but
only
good
enough
for
hand
pleasure
i
came
something
you
keep
around
for
a
quick
fix
but
not
the
true
love
you
desire
the
sweet
pleasure
of
those
lips
may
get
you
through
the
night
tonight
but
there
always
comes
another
day
keep
this
beer
handy
for
those
quick
fixes
though
my
friends
one
overlooked
aspect
to
this
drink
is
that
it
is
a
massive
hit
with
the
ladies
again
this
might
disqualify
it
from
consideration
for
beer
graybeardsintraining
but
if
you
want
to
rock
your
girl
with
a
deceptive
alcohol
content
and
give
her
a
drink
that
she
will
crave
and
keep
asking
for
more
then
look
no
further
than
kasteel
rouge
how
well
it
masks
the
taste
of
rufies
i
dont
know
yet
but
there
is
a
significant
chance
that
with
kasteel
rouge
you
wont
need
them
at
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
fruit
beer
the
malt
provides
a
nice
balance
to
the
tart
sweet
cherries
all
of
the
flavors
mesh
quite
well
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
adds
warmth
and
body
and
doesnt
take
away
from
the
flavor
the
slight
medicinal
note
is
really
the
only
offputting
part
of
this
one
and
even
then
its
faint
and
almost
negligible
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
you
would
definately
never
guess
the
abv
on
tap
at
cheeky
monk
in
denver
pours
dark
amber
with
a
shortlived
white
head
and
much
lacing
strong
aroma
is
of
cherries
body
is
full
and
smooth
taste
is
mostly
sour
cherry
caramel
malt
and
candy
sugar
finish
is
long
and
sweet
this
brew
is
too
sweet
for
me
the
color
is
red
bit
darker
then
the
usual
capsuled
kriek
taste
also
a
bit
darker
less
sweet
but
it
misses
the
sour
aspect
overall
a
nice
red
fruit
beer
sweetness
bit
masked
by
the
high
alcohol
8
definitely
a
nice
alternative
to
a
sweet
red
wine
in
the
summer
sun
o
the
cherry
flavor
is
big
and
sweet
and
there
are
no
other
flavors
to
cut
it
down
there
isnt
any
depth
and
it
is
a
bit
like
drinking
liquid
candy
it
was
pretty
hard
to
get
through
the
bottle
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
two
finger
slight
pink
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
fruit
and
cherry
cough
syrup
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
big
cherry
subtle
cream
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
cherry
coming
off
of
this
one
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
rather
intense
on
the
aroma
it
seriously
reminded
of
cherry
cough
syrup
that
i
had
when
i
was
feeling
bad
as
a
child
however
this
did
taste
much
better
there
was
a
nice
cream
note
going
on
to
help
balance
out
the
cherry
sweetness
but
it
was
a
case
of
too
little
too
late
a
very
sweet
finish
to
my
day
but
i
could
see
this
one
opening
up
quite
a
few
people
to
this
style
o
this
was
so
interesting
much
sweeter
than
i
thought
because
it
was
described
as
a
quad
on
the
menu
i
recommend
you
try
it
if
you
see
it
o
has
a
nice
deep
red
look
to
it
and
a
good
cherry
smell
i
was
dissappointed
in
its
lack
of
flavor
depth
at
8
abv
i
feel
it
couldnt
release
some
other
nice
flavors
before
it
was
overwhelmed
by
alcohol
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
appropriate
and
had
a
somewhat
light
feel
to
an
alcoholic
beer
great
beer
pours
deep
dark
mahogany
in
color
with
a
lasting
quarter
inch
bubbly
tan
head
into
one
of
the
coolest
beer
specific
glasses
ive
ever
seen
smells
like
cherry
jolly
ranchers
a
bit
artificial
on
the
fruit
front
very
sugary
with
plenty
of
red
and
caramel
malts
in
there
as
well
flavor
is
also
very
jolly
rancherlike
tart
and
sweet
tons
of
cherries
more
of
a
jellied
or
candied
cherry
flavor
than
a
fresh
cherry
but
it
works
well
in
this
beer
the
belgian
yeast
compliments
it
very
nicely
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
bigger
than
medium
body
not
sure
id
drink
these
all
night
but
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
try
once
especially
on
tap
the
cherry
in
this
is
unlike
the
cherry
in
any
other
beer
ive
had
definitely
check
this
one
out
o
i
was
looking
for
a
gueuze
or
something
similarly
sour
and
this
was
what
we
ended
up
getting
the
cherry
flavor
is
really
sweet
and
i
think
a
little
bit
overdone
i
can
definitely
taste
the
addition
of
cherry
juice
and
its
not
a
good
thing
if
the
cherry
flavor
were
dialed
back
a
bit
it
would
be
better
rather
strong
fruit
beer
with
more
depths
and
characters
but
its
still
easy
to
drink
anyway
drinkabilityoverall
i
actually
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
you
have
to
know
what
you
are
getting
into
when
you
buy
this
beer
it
is
straight
up
cherry
desert
beer
that
being
said
its
not
cloying
sweet
and
has
nice
enjoyable
flavor
its
a
good
beer
that
i
would
occasionally
go
to
when
looking
for
an
after
dinner
desert
kind
of
treat
though
not
hard
to
drink
best
split
with
someone
i
think
i
would
give
a
slight
edge
to
new
belgiums
frambozen
tastewise
because
thats
more
tart
while
this
is
more
sweet
but
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
and
i
would
have
again
too
sweet
and
fruity
for
me
whatcha
smell
is
whatcha
get
was
expecting
it
to
be
bitter
but
it
was
surprisingly
well
balanced
poured
from
a
12oz
short
and
stubby
bottle
this
pours
a
light
to
medium
bodied
cherry
syrup
red
it
looks
like
cherry
juice
if
you
put
a
glass
of
cherry
juice
right
next
to
my
glass
now
i
would
not
be
able
to
tell
you
which
is
the
real
thing
it
smells
like
sweet
cherry
pie
filling
with
little
to
no
tartness
the
flavor
however
is
syrupy
and
medicinal
and
has
a
dusty
musty
finish
that
is
very
offputting
it
instantly
makes
this
one
unenjoyable
and
kills
all
likeability
it
drinks
light
and
sticky
due
to
all
of
the
sugar
overall
this
is
a
medicinal
sugar
bomb
that
is
not
worth
your
time
especially
being
as
pricey
as
it
is
if
you
want
cherries
go
for
a
kriek
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
slight
half
finger
head
which
is
slightly
pink
there
is
little
to
no
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
cherries
and
raspberries
there
is
also
a
nice
floral
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
straigth
cherries
and
raspberries
it
is
very
sweet
but
appealing
the
mouthfeel
is
lowly
carbonated
and
sticky
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
very
sweet
but
it
is
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
o
not
as
excellent
as
a
framboise
but
comes
pretty
damn
close
i
happen
to
have
a
sweet
tooth
if
you
didnt
notice
already
poured
a
750
into
two
tulips
very
strong
sweet
maraschino
cherry
nose
plenty
of
light
carbonation
and
solid
moutfeel
cherry
flavor
is
just
right
with
not
too
much
belgian
yeast
coming
through
one
of
my
favorite
cherry
style
beers
but
not
on
par
with
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
smell
and
taste
are
cherrielike
the
alcohol
in
it
makes
that
you
could
call
this
a
beer
but
it
isnt
mouthfeel
is
like
drinking
a
cherry
cola
overall
a
very
disappointing
beer
d
best
to
split
a
bottle
with
someone
as
the
sweet
cough
syrup
part
tends
to
be
a
bit
much
but
it
is
tasty
in
small
doses
o
decently
drinkable
because
its
dry
but
still
difficult
glad
i
didnt
have
the
whole
thing
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
that
i
will
likely
imbibe
in
time
and
time
again

aromas
of
big
fresh
cherries
and
cherry
juice
with
a
bit
of
tartness
and
spices
in
there
as
well
aromas
are
nice
and
strong
and
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
bottle
description
taste
of
tons
of
cherries
cherry
juice
tartness
cherry
skin
and
a
bit
of
spices
as
well
no
bitterness
noticed
but
there
is
a
ton
of
cherry
skin
tartness
and
sweet
notes
lingering
on
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
spices
as
well
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
drinks
very
smooth
for
the
alcohol
level
but
is
still
quite
a
sipper
due
to
big
flavor
and
sweetness
no
alcohol
noticed
other
than
a
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
cherry
ale
in
my
opinion
tons
of
flavor
o
too
much
alcohol
and
i
dont
really
like
this
kind
of
bitterness
not
too
sweet
tough
which
isnt
as
evident
for
a
cherry
beer
a
delicious
cherry
beer
thats
really
it
kind
of
a
one
dimensional
beer
but
in
a
decent
way
i
can
read
a
bottle
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
cherry
flavor
is
pure
but
this
is
not
a
beer
you
want
to
buy
more
than
one
of
a
novelty
at
best
overall
you
have
to
appreciate
the
style
to
appreciate
the
beer
russian
river
obviously
have
done
well
in
this
genre
and
therefore
i
tend
to
compare
my
fruit
beers
to
them
this
one
was
good
not
too
offensive
d
apidimi
of
a
sissy
drink
no
thank
you
i
like
me
beer
tasting
like
beer
o
a
real
delight
overall
you
can
keep
the
cherry
pie
ill
just
drink
this
for
desert
o
leaves
you
with
a
sweet
medicinal
cherry
taste
wont
say
much
as
while
the
beer
wasnt
bad
at
all
i
didnt
find
much
about
it
entirely
remarkable
entirely
yeastless
for
a
belgian
tons
of
cherry
in
the
nose
and
taste
maraschino
cherries
really
have
their
powerful
sweetness
tucked
in
by
a
little
tartness
from
a
dark
cherry
flavor
that
i
think
composed
about
13
of
the
taste
and
complexity
of
the
beer
really
sweet
with
nice
tartsour
notes
to
add
some
hit
and
complexity
tasty
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
do
this
is
dessert
beer
in
every
sense
of
the
word
for
those
that
say
its
too
sweet
pick
yourself
up
a
belgian
red
from
new
glarus
for
1
less
of
course
the
cherries
are
well
done
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
sweet
cherries
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
some
caramel
or
toffee
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
if
you
like
cherries
but
you
wont
have
a
cold
for
weeks

the

of

you
get

is
at

a

quickly
turns
into
an
almost
diet

as
it
breathes
the
diet
sodaness
but
still
maintains
a
strong
sugary
taste
doesnt
really
have
any
beerlike
qualities
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
the
first
belgian
fruit
beer
that
wasnt
a
lambic
that
ive
tried
if
youre
new
to
this
kind
of
beer
and
looking
to
explore
then
give
it
a
shot
but
there
are
probably
better
belgian
fruit
beers
out
there
overall
didnt
like
this
one
that
much
the
second
time
though
scores
okay
marks
for
being
better
than
a
lindemans
with
a
more
interesting
and
complex
flavor
but
very
much
too
sweet
in
the
end
d
personally
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
because
this
is
too
fruity
for
guys
definitely
a
ladies
drink
drinkability
was
pretty
high
which
surprised
me
it
could
have
been
the
occasion
as
i
was
tired
and
thirsty
from
walking
around
all
day
on
a
nice
fall
day
no
sun
tshirt
and
jeans
light
breeze
but
this
went
down
in
a
hurry
and
if
my
wife
afforded
me
the
time
i
would
have
enjoyed
another
no
problem
very
smooth
dangerous
abv
perhaps
the
best
pure
fruit
beer
out
there
d
a
good
after
dinner
drink
not
as
complex
as
say
a
cherry
lambic
but
the
cleanness
of
the
flavor
is
great
and
the
alcohol
level
in
this
beer
gives
it
a
nice
kick
gorgeous
without
being
heavy
or
cloying
fresh
dark
cherries
and
gentle
carbonation
dance
around
my
mouth
in
a
feat
that
few
other
than
the
belgians
can
accomplish
and
with
a
flavor
that
is
both
singular
and
complex
i
love
beer
that
redefines
beer
and
this
beer
tosses
your
beliefs
into
a
vat
of
cherries
notes
this
is
a
fruit
beer
that
is
full
of
fruit
smell
and
flavor
if
you
are
looking
for
a
real
fruit
beer
experience
and
not
just
a
beer
with
a
subtle
aroma
of
fruit
then
this
one
is
a
good
choice
love

do
not

admit
this

i
just

it
is

who
am

to

in

this

kasteel
rouge
is
definitely
in
the
realm
of
sweet
fruit
beers
i
generally
prefer
my
fruit
beers
on
the
drier
side
this
brew
is
still
quite
enjoyable
and
is
highly
drinkable
to
boot
a
bit
to
syrupy
sweet
for
my
taste
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
your
into
the
fruit
like
beers
d
im
trying
to
give
this
brew
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
it
seems
terribly
onesided
to
me
i
want
to
taste
more
than
cherry
juice
when
i
drink
a
beer
brewed
with
cherries
i
can
imagine
that
it
would
pair
decently
well
with
a
duck
pate
or
a
rich
chocolate
cake
but
a
beer
cant
rely
on
food
pairings
to
make
it
palatable
pretty
disappointing

when
the
mood
strikes
d
not
sure
i
would
drink
a
bunch
glad
i
tried
it
was
not
bad
for
this
style
either
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
cherry
pie
filling
sweet
and
tart
cherry
fill
the
palate
again
really
in
your
face
it
does
have
a
some
what
artificial
taste
lingering
in
the
after
taste
very
easy
to
drink
although
it
is
incredibly
sweet
for
my
palate
any
of
my
female
suitors
would
love
this
beer
i
love
cherries
with
a
passion
and
want
to
give
this
beer
a
super
high
score
but
it
focuses
on
cherries
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
looks
dark
red
had
about
an
inch
head
on
it
the
smell
was
very
very
cherry
it
worried
me
for
a
sec
but
one
sip
put
a
smile
on
my
face
they
got
it
right
the
beer
has
a
little
tartness
to
it
and
is
far
from
too
sweet
it
actually
tastes
like
some
delicious
cherries
not
the
syrup
flavor
other
beers
have
good
carbonationthis
beer
beer
went
down
easy
but
i
cant
say
id
go
back
for
more
any
time
soon
still
if
i
were
to
have
another
cherry
beer
this
one
would
come
to
mind
drinkability
sweet
commercial
krieks
too
abv
i
prefer
traditional
krieks
d
this
was
a
pretty
short
review
but
theres
nothing
else
to
really
say
about
this
beer
except
for
the
cherries
not
much
beer
flavor
great
to
end
dinner
with
off
the
tap
at
the
daily
planet
this
beer
was
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
garnet
meniscus
the
onefinger
of
tan
head
retained
as
a
thin
collar
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
and
punchy
like
cherry
cough
syrup
blended
with
brandy
reminiscent
of
a
kir
the
flavors
were
equally
sweet
and
alcoholic
candy
sugar
tart
cherries
currants
candied
nuts
a
touch
of
wood
and
bitterness
plus
lots
of
alcohol
heat
cloying
and
acidic
the
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
slick
but
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
the
flavor
combination
was
pretty
good
but
it
could
only
be
enjoyed
strictly
as
a
dessert
and
i
would
not
order
more
than
one
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
id
be
rushing
out
for
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
sure
of
it
as
a
session
brew
due
to
the
sweetsour
component
but
i
would
have
it
again
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
fruit
beer
in
close
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
i
have
a
real
sweet
tooth
and
this
is
definatly
satisfying
it
it
may
not
be
the
worlds
most
complex
beer
but
its
not
trying
to
be
its
just
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
thats
perfect
for
summer
so
drink
up
my
fellow
sultans
of
sweet
d
yeah
its
kind
of
girly
but
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
better
dessert
beer
or
a
better
gateway
beer
for
someone
with
a
sweet
tooth
overall
impression
a
cherryflavor
beverage
the
only
downside
really
is
that
it
tastes
more
like
a
mikes
hard
cherryaid
than
a
belgian
beer
regardless
its
tasty
i
feel
rather
guilty
for
rating
it
so
high
when
its
been
so
heavily
debeered
but
eh
its
good
i
would
happily
pair
this
with
a
pepper
encrusted
venison
tenderloin
with
a
merlot
reduction
or
duck
with
a
cherry
sauce
the
beer
felt
light
smooth
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
very
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
offputting
it
was
dry
and
had
no
real
carbonation
to
speak
of
for
the
style
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
either
perhaps
the
beer
would
have
worked
better
after
dinner
wow
another
bsolutely
great
kasteel
beer
i
first
tasted
this
one
in
some
bar
in
amsterdam
a
few
months
ago
and
i
was
absolutely
impressed
i
found
a
place
to
buy
a
bottle
and
have
it
home
served
in
a
kasteel
glass
very
beautiful
cherry
red
colour
with
wonderful
ruby
reflections
when
hold
it
to
the
light
pinky
creamy
foam
like
a
cherrie
ice
cream
that
last
just
for
a
second
smells
of
cherries
marzipan
apple
pie
bitter
almonds
or
amaretto
a
like
brandy
flavor
tastes
of
cherries
vanilla
apricot
acid
notes
from
the
cherries
but
is
also
sweet
nice
balanced
and
i
find
even
some
pepper
really
great
but
of
course
you
cant
drink
many
of
them
in
the
same
night
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
almost
creamy
on
the
palate
finishes
fairly
crisp
with
a
strong
cherry
aftertaste
i
can
taste
a
small
bit
of
alcohol
but
not
what
i
expected
with
the
8
abv
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
one
i
will
be
recommending
to
all
of
my
friends
that
enjoy
this
brewing
style
good
stuff
especially
considering
a
lindemans
is
approximately
the
same
price
for
a
small
bottle
as
this
was
for
a
750ml
d
to
me
this
was
one
delicious
beer
one
that
i
could
drink
for
dessert
or
drink
with
a
slice
of
cheesecake
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
that
ive
had
worth
trying
definitely
not
an
opener
but
can
be
a
memorable
closing
beer
for
those
with
the
taste
for
it
this
brew
pours
a
mostly
brown
color
with
ruby
red
highlights
especially
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
an
interesting
pinkish
color
without
great
stayingpower
the
smell
is
very
good
lots
of
cherry
flavor
in
the
aroma
dominating
actually
with
also
a
little
malt
and
alcohol
underneath
ripe
black
cherry
aromas
are
central
though
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
black
cherry
soda
although
not
artificial
its
mildly
sweet
with
a
nice
tang
and
slightly
sour
note
not
at
all
like
a
fruit
lambic
yet
just
a
bit
sour
the
sourness
does
a
great
job
providing
some
balance
to
the
beer
which
could
easily
become
too
fruity
without
it
malt
is
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
no
hop
character
at
all
although
it
was
in
the
aroma
there
is
basically
no
alcohol
in
the
flavor
fairly
full
in
body
especially
for
a
fruit
beer
great
lingering
finish
with
lots
of
cherry
what
is
this
nothing
i
will
ever
drink
again
on
occasion
i
like
a
good
fruit
beer
but
this
tastes
like
artificial
cherries
i
will
probably
end
up
poring
the
rest
out
drinkability
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
awesome
while
it
tastes
cherry
it
still
feels
like
beer
i
will
certainly
seek
this
one
out
again
brouwerij
van
honsebrouck
hasnt
failed
me
yet
kasteel
rouge
is
a
fantastic
choice
if
you
like
sweet
fruit
beer
that
is
also
deep
rich
and
complex
this
brew
is
a
more
than
pleasant
surprise
and
is
a
repeat
purchase
for
sure
this
is
very
sweet
and
i
could
drink
this
all
day
except
there
are
better
beers
for
me
to
waste
my
time
with
overall
too
fruity
too
much
like
red
wine
pours
a
hazy
dark
maroon
color
14
inch
head
of
a
purple
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
strongly
of
cherries
and
the
slightest
sweet
malt
aroma
fits
the
style
of
a
fruitvegetable
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
theres
an
average
carbonation
level
and
a
strong
tartness
tastes
of
cherry
first
then
a
strong
cider
flavor
and
a
very
tart
finish
my
girlfriend
swears
by
this
brew
but
its
nothing
special
by
my
standards
im
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
fan
but
this
was
drinkable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
fruitvegetable
beer
and
it
was
quite
refreshing
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
d
the
drinkability
really
saves
this
brew
it
made
it
much
easier
to
get
down
despite
the
taste
medium
bodied
somewhat
syruppy
more
of
a
dessert
or
after
dinner
brew
you
could
even
pour
this
over
ice
cream
or
make
a
sorbet
d
the
best
cough
syrup
ive
had
but
nothing
all
that
inspiring
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
damn
good
of
course
there
are
better
versions
out
there
but
this
is
a
solid
choice
since
its
cheaper
than
many
of
the
others
its
all
cherry
dont
let
the
description
fool
you
there
isnt
much
malt
or
hops
or
yeast
to
e
found
in
this
one
still
its
a
cool
switch
from
the
everyday
i
found
the
description
a
little
disingenuous
instead
of
belgian
ale
with
cherry
juice
added
i
think
it
comes
across
as
sour
cherry
juice
with
a
splash
of
belgian
ale
ive
had
several
other
belgiancherry
combos
and
none
were
this
fruity
more
like
a
lambic
really
i
almost
poured
it
out
but
im
saving
it
to
possibly
use
as
a
sauce
maybe
for
pork
chops
poured
this
deep
rich
cherry
colored
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
gave
off
a
pinkish
foam
as
it
first
was
poured
and
kept
a
lingerance
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
that
of
cherries
and
malts
the
taste
followed
with
the
aroma
yet
with
notes
of
spices
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
just
has
a
nice
palate
of
flavors
to
enjoy
while
sitting
down
and
sipping
a
beer
this
beer
was
not
for
me
way
to
much
cherry
flavor
and
it
needed
to
be
toned
down
drinkability
a
bit
simple
with
its
delivery
of
just
cherries
and
jolting
sweetness
me
id
sooner
reach
for
something
a
bit
more
graceful
like
new
glarus
belgian
red
still
though
i
found
it
reasonably
enjoyable
but
i
could
see
many
people
considering
this
to
be
outright
cloying
small
sparkly
pink
head
well
carbonated
color
is
reminiscent
of
blood
oranges
strong
aroma
of
sweet
cherries
and
cinnamon
starts
sweet
and
tart
cherry
is
front
and
center
medium
body
cherry
flavor
doninates
throughout
ultimately
more
on
the
sweet
than
tart
side
finish
is
dry
alcohol
is
present
but
not
too
strong
good
sweet
contrast
to
the
tartness
of
the
ng
belgian
red
drinkable
but
not
overly
pleasant
overall
i
think
people
might
enjoy
this
if
theyre
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
again
i
cant
handle
it
caveat
emptor
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
a
little
too
prickly
drinkability
is
decent
but
cherry
flavor
could
be
a
little
over
bearing
after
a
while
pretty
good
representation
of
a
fruit
beer
d
while
i
dont
drink
fruit
beers
that
often
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
one
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
pours
an
opaque
strongly
reddish
mahogany
with
a
finebubbled
pinkish
head
scent
of
cherries
dominates
the
the
malty
aroma
flavor
is
almost
too
sweet
mainly
cherry
with
an
undertone
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
pleasing
and
aftertaste
is
mainly
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
hints
of
hops
again
its
not
very
complex
but
sometimes
it
doesnt
need
to
be
to
be
very
good
i
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
though
drinking
an
entire
bottle
of
this
might
be
a
task
with
the
overpowering
sweetness
nice
stuff
good
balance
between
the
cherry
tartness
and
sweet
notes
and
both
the
body
and
especially
the
drinkbility
were
great
this
was
a
nice
one
for
the
wife
and
i
to
split
mouthfeel
drinkability
both
are
very
good
particularly
considering
the
sweetness
due
to
the
high
tart
acidity
d
i
am
not
big
fan
of
fruity
brews
but
this
one
grew
on
me
as
it
warms
in
your
glass
it
warms
to
the
palette
not
a
bad
beer
and
if
you
like
cherries
youll
really
like
this
one
but
give
her
a
try
nonetheless
got
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
company
holiday
party
was
basically
what
i
expected
a
maroon
beer
with
a
weak
head
that
smells
and
tastes
like
what
it
is
cherry
syrup
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
beer
flavor
in
the
taste
not
so
much
in
the
nose
which
is
really
just
sweet
almost
cough
syrup
cherry
with
some
sourness
thats
fairly
interesting
bodys
fine
and
the
carbonations
fairly
appropriate
its
not
really
my
style
but
its
not
garbage
by
any
means
probably
couldnt
have
more
than
one
though
dhard
to
drink
too
many
of
because
of
the
intense
flavor
and
high
carbonation
tastes
very
goodthe
lack
of
complexity
and
beeriness
is
a
little
more
present
and
is
slightly
detrimental
too
tastes
like
super
duper
cherries
tastes
like
a
ludens
cough
drop
thisgoddamnit
this
is
like
the
leinenkugels
nut
brown
shit
where
it
tastes
so
good
its
almost
like
its
cheating
since
theres
obviously
been
something
added
to
this
thats
not
beerish
enough
im
more
apt
to
trust
kasteel
than
miller
though
so
ill
give
these
guys
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
assume
this
is
real
cherries
and
not
xylatol614
or
whatever
mouthfeel
is
crisp
sweet
very
drinkable
overall
nice
for
desert
but
i
likely
wouldnt
buy
again
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
very
sweet
and
very
sharp
check
it
out
i
dug
it
edit
next
morning
okay
the
whole
review
is
right
one
except
for
the
pregnant
lady
part
i
swear
it
made
sense
at
the
time
but
now
i
dont
quite
see
what
i
was
getting
at
almost
but
not
quite
on
tap
at
madison
wis
malt
house
bold
and
rich
cherry
red
body
with
pinkish
head
tons
of
cherry
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
my
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
artificial
cherry
lending
almost
a
medicinal
tinge
a
second
sip
and
each
subsequent
proved
just
how
wrong
my
first
impression
was
fullon
cherry
enveloped
my
taste
buds
and
at
8
00
provided
a
dangerous
beer
to
session
if
not
for
the
sweetness
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
love
the
bitter
burnt
flavors
in
many
other
styles
but
this
is
just
such
a
unique
experience
for
any
beer
lover
superb
fruit
beer
i
am
not
a
big
lambic
or
sour
fan
but
this
beer
defintely
scores
well
with
me
there
is
a
good
cherry
taste
without
being
tangy
or
overbearing
this
beer
is
a
good
mix
for
someone
like
me
who
loves
malty
thick
beers
and
my
wife
who
hates
beer
but
loved
this
offering
and
is
now
tasting
everything
i
bring
home
short
and
stubby
belgian
style
bottle
pours
rich
reddish
amber
cough
syrup
style
pungent
cherry
nose
quickly
departing
red
hued
head
and
then
leaving
next
to
no
lace
sweet
sour
tart
pleasantly
fruity
with
notes
of
cherry
raspberry
cough
syrup
layers
of
dense
pungent
and
intense
fruit
nice
stuff
well
worth
a
try
would
be
nice
with
a
chocolate
andor
fruity
dessert
not
much
to
this
belgian
the
high
alcohol
contnet
at
times
seems
to
overpower
this
beer
and
can
taste
a
bit
like
nyquill
takes
me
back
to
my
younger
years
when
sneaking
a
bit
of
nyquill
was
quite
the
night
out
it
forms
well
in
the
mouth
and
is
easy
to
drink
if
the
alcohol
doesnt
bother
you
the
smell
is
strong
and
pungent
and
rather
pleasing
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
then
again
nothing
special
either
this
was
an
expensive
beer
in
a
short
bottle
but
worth
it
if
you
like
fruity
beer
a
lot
better
than
warrants
shes
my
cherry
pie
cool
drink
of
water
what
a
sweet
suprise
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
fruit
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
but
id
definetly
throw
this
beer
my
rotational
fruit
beer
catalog
please
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
the
review
as
i
said
it
is
my
first
and
i
want
to
improve
upon
this
skill
thanks
a
lot
a
big
strong
sour
tart
cherry
tastevery
desertlike
doesnt
remind
me
of
beeryet
not
offensivei
kind
of
like
it
sweet
sugary
upfront
with
the
sour
tart
cherry
taste
midway
and
through
the
finish
with
a
sweet
tart
taste
lingering
not
syrupy
like
a
lot
of
fruit
beershas
a
slight
doughy
yeasty
taste
to
it
has
a
bit
of
a
champagne
like
mouthfeel
goes
down
easily
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
with
a
very
slight
touch
of
heat
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
ofbut
does
go
down
quite
easily
more
like
a
desert
beer
if
you
like
cherrie
this
is
the
beer
for
you
lots
of
cherry
to
this
beeryet
not
to
overpowering
wisconsin
belgian
red
is
significantly
superior
if
you
like
a
tart
taste
to
balance
if
you
want
unabashed
sweetness
this
one
is
for
you
higher
alcohol
than
i
presumed
delicious
a
candy
beer
so
its
hard
to
give
it
great
ratings
within
the
style
but
its
enjoyable
a
good
beer
but
not
one
ill
be
looking
to
purchase
again
anytime
soon
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
on
draft
but
will
probably
not
revisit
again
unless
of
course
my
girlfriend
orders
it
and
cant
finish
it
herself
carbonated
red
with
white
lacing
and
head
smells
and
tastes
like
the
aforementioned
cherry
cough
syrup
but
sweeter
and
more
appealing
not
too
strong
but
the
fruity
flavor
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
to
consider
too
drinkable
interesting
but
not
something
i
enjoyed
too
much
finish
is
hard
to
finish
a
whole
bottle
small
amounts
are
better
to
share
with
freinds
in
little
tasting
glasses
not
a
session
beer
whatsoever
but
a
after
dinner
sipper
maybe
on
a
day
that
looks
like
the
town
on
the
bottles
picture
a
smoggy
dark
dreary
night
d
carbonation
helped
with
the
drinkability
as
well
but
im
glad
i
shared
this
bottle
amongst
friends
rather
than
drinking
the
whole
thing
light
effervescence

wow
this
is

stuff
delightfully

and
clean

good

one
of
the
nicest
most
enjoyable
beers
in
existence
bottle
was
kasteel
rouge
same
as
kasteel
kriek
i
also
have
enjoyed
doing
a
black
and
tan
of
sorts
with
this
beer
mixing
it
with
old
rasputin
imperial
stout
floating
it
its
not
an
easy
task
i
call
it
the
amber
spider
its
amazing
like
eating
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
the
combination
of
the
two
beers
also
creates
a
really
nice
head
on
the
rasputin
makes
it
a
bit
more
creamy
i
had
two
last
night
pours
a
deep
amber
red
color
with
a
pink
head
aromas
of
sour
dark
cherries
right
in
their
prime
in
the
taste
dark
cherry
a
small
sourness
and
well
a
bit
surypy
almost
medicinal
aftertaste
of
a
small
cherry
and
a
coating
in
the
mouth
not
too
sweet
nice
alcohol
and
deffinatly
not
a
girly
beer
d
ok
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
made
this
decently
drinkable
the
robitussin
taste
got
to
me
later
on
in
the
beer
which
made
it
less
appealing
to
me
burgundy
colored
ale
with
a
pink

rapidly
fades

smell
is

taste
is

cherry

this
is
not
a
beer
you
would
be
drinking
during
a
sunday
football
game
or
while
mowing
your
lawn
i
will
say
this
is
good
but
give
me
an
ice
cold
budweiser
anyday
over
this
i
would
describe
this
as
a
lambic
wannabe
overall
id
say
its
one
dimensional
it
is
tasty
and
decently
priced

v
tonight
very
delicious
slightly
sweet
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
a
super
session
beer
but
very
flavorful
very
stong
cherry
flavor
and
definitely
nice
solid
malt
cackbone
to
it
all
around
formed
a
good
beer
and
my
non
beer
geek
friend
found
it
his
favorite
new
session
beer
although
lindemans
too
sweet
for
me
was
his
favorite
before
hand
really
crisp
and
zingy
kasteel
rouge
is
plenty
tasty
with
a
zip
of
carbonation
and
no
indication
of
the
abv
the
tang
of
the
drink
limits
the
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
d
i
do
love
this
beer
but
in
moderation
one
beer
this
sweet
is
enough
for
me
on
to
something
hoppy
bottle
courtesy
of
secret
santa
poured
a
deep
red
color
ale
with
a
light
pink
color
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
consists
of
syrupy
cherry
with
too
much
of
sweet
cloying
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
extremely
sweet
cherry
syrup
with
some
very
light
malt
notes
full
cloying
sweet
body
with
some
average
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
too
sweet
for
my
taste
buds
and
too
much
of
the
fake
cherry
syrup
comes
out
for
me
to
enjoy
this
beer
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
perfect
to
have
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
maybe
even
make
beer
floats
with
this
alcohol
very
well
hidden
a
nice
little
diversion
but
honestly
this
should
have
been
a
taster
sized
serving
a
real
rich
dark
red
from
the
moment
i
opened
the
bottle
the
room
filed
with
cherries
my
mouth
was
wattering
at
just
the
smell
it
was
love
at
first
sip
this
one
is
like
a
less
sweet
cherry
soda
with
a
slight
belgan
beer
aftertaste
this
one
could
pass
as
fine
wine
as
far
as
cherry
beer
goes
i
think
this
one
is
top
dog
for
me
so
far
beating
out
lindamins
next
time
i
will
buy
more
than
just
the
11
2
oz
that
i
got
if
you
like
cherry
beer
this
one
is
for
you
one
of
the
more
distinct
and
impressive
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
better
than
a
straightup
lambic
while
nearly
as
sweet
and
more
complex
excellent
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
flavoredfruit
beers
some
are
good
while
some
make
the
attempt
but
tragically
fail
this
is
the
latter
from
the
crimson
clear
color
looking
at
this
through
a
glass
almost
looks
like
peering
through
a
liquid
filled
ruby
with
tons
of
little
bubbles
for
your
enjoyment
the
rose
white
head
appears
fast
but
lingers
for
a
slow
dissolve
showing
that
there
are
definately
cherries
in
the
mix
sour
cherries
fill
the
air
with
hints
of
malt
and
oak
adding
to
the
desire
of
the
mix
with
the
first
taste
you
get
blasted
with
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
that
slowly
turns
a
sour
edge
the
thin
crispness
and
high
carbonation
fill
your
mouth
making
a
smooth
feel
that
ends
in
a
bitterness
that
is
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
great
form
the
mid
range
abv
to
the
flavor
it
proved
its
self
to
me
at
least
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pop
open
and
have
with
desert
poured
into
a
tulip
from
bottle
deep
red
with
a
off
white
pink
head
that
lowers
quick
on
a
gentle
pour
nice
steady
ring
around
the
glass
edge
contrasting
the
redish
brown
brew
good
carbonation
from
appearance
the
d
at
the
bottle
of
the
duvel
glass
is
constantly
providing
an
escape
of
bubbles
and
creating
a
white
circle
in
the
center
smell
is
totally
cherry
with
some
brown
ale
undertones
very
sweet
taste
up
front
slightly
bitter
in
the
back
carbonation
is
good
on
the
tongue
the
cherry
isnt
really
in
your
face
in
taste
not
really
medicine
like
a
lot
of
these
styles
can
be
not
a
bad
cherry
the
finish
is
again
very
sweet
long
lasting
and
sticking
very
much
to
the
tongue
and
palate
i
found
this
unpalatably
sweet
and
way
too
close
to
drinking
cherry
cough
syrup
at
the
risk
of
repeating
myself
to
its
credit
the
alcohol
was
hidden
pretty
well
available
on
tap
and
bottled
at
capones
initially
tried
in
a
sampler
set
with
some
pretty
heavy
duty
stouts
and
ipas
in
which
setting
it
proved
to
be
a
quite
tasty
refreshing
cherry
beer
it
wasnt
until
several
days
later
when
i
was
drinking
the
bottle
i
picked
up
that
i
realized
what
was
wrong
with
it
while
being
good
it
more
closely
resembled
carbonated
cherry
juice
rather
than
of
a
beer
very
good
cherry
juice
to
say
the
least
nice
sweet
smell
never
cloyed
slightly
syrupy
but
with
more
than
enough
carbonation
to
compensate
but
still
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
in
small
quantities
as
a
quick
refresher
in
between
tasting
some
deep
stouts
or
porters
but
never
in
quantity
and
never
as
a
standalone
bottle
years
ago
this
was
my
first
authentic
belgian
i
aged
this
bottle
just
under
a
year
and
found
the
trial
aided
the
aroma
at
the
expense
of
the
flavor
not
a
bad
trade
but
worth
making
note
rjr
pours
a
two
finger

that

to

it
is
what
it
is
a
sweet
cherry
ale
that
tastes
great
i
doubt
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
it
is
a
good
brew
and
one
that
i
will
be
buying
again
well
it
pours
very
red
with
a
pink

nose
is

its
just
sweet
bloody
sweet
feel
is
fine
nice
carbonation
with
a
good

its

its
just
reeeeal
sweet
like
i
said
liquified

arrived
in
a
very
classey
kasteel

i
like
the
little
house
structure
at
the
base
of
the
glass
very
neat
dark
red
color
with
a
little
bit
of
a
red
head
smell
was
of
cherries
and
booze
almost
tastes
like
cherry
coke
with
a
shot
of
alcohol
in
it
very
simple
beer
mouthfeel
was
decent
medium
carbonation
took
me
a
while
to
finish
but
thats
ok
i
would
order
again
i
cant
really
recommend
this
brew
it
tastes
like
cough
syrup
with
a
hint
of
beer
pours

deep
bight
crimsonscarlet

held

maltieness
midway
keeps
it
interesting
and
distracts
from
the
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
spritzynot
syrupy
or
sticky
at
all
its
very
good
considering
cherry
syrup
is
added
i
belive
a
great
belgian
offeringquality
this
beer
is
all
about
the
cherries
it
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
with
some
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
you
guessed
it
cherries
the
taste
is
basically
a
flatish
cherry
cola
with
some
tartness
and
a
slight
sweet
malty
background
that
appears
in
the
finish
the
two
endearing
qualities
to
this
beer
are
its
refreshing
crispness
and
the
very
well
masked
over
8
abv
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
flemish
red
experience
and
instead
i
got
a
slightly
artificial
cherry
experience
that
isnt
bad
but
one
im
not
keen
on
returning
too
either
as
the
beer
begins
to
settle
im
getting
more
of
a
cherry
cough
syrup
taste
that
is
not
all
that
nice
as
one
reviewer
said
this
would
be
a
nice
after
dinner
dessert
beer
in
place
of
a
sweet
wine
okay
ill
go
with
that
but
drink
it
before
it
gets
too
cough
syrupy
pours
a
dark

some

slight

medium

easy
drinking
for
a
8
abv
brew
for
sure
drinkable
my
first
from
this
brewery
pours
like
a
dark
red
cranberry
juice
out
of
the
box
smells
of
a
dark
cherry
with
the
seed
still
left
in
a
slight
bit
of
tart
off
the
cherries
comes
out
as
well
the
palate
is
significantly
tart
with
the
cherries
tasting
as
if
they
were
put
on
an
ice
cream
sundae
at
walmart
the
sweetness
feels
quite
a
bit
artificial
not
natural
not
bad
but
the
palate
wained
a
little
bit
comparing
to
the
nose
d
this
tasty
belgian
ale
has
a
superb
cherry
vibe
its
sweet
tart
and
sour
and
extremely
drinkable
dvery
nice
cherry
beer
with
a
nice
amount
of
flavour
that
does
not
go
over
the
top
this
is
a
very
nice
apertif
beverage
usually
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruitbeers
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
an
artisinal
beer
it
is
sugarfree
soda
with
beer
the
strong
cherry
flavor
hits
you
first
and
then
theres
that
tartness
and
a
little
bit
of
tingle
after
the
swallow
i
didnt
notice
too
much
carbonation
but
then
again
ive
been
nursing
this
one
for
an
hour
or
so
man
thats
good
on
tap
no
head
on
pour
when
it
reached
me
dark
brown
tawny
highlights
smells
intense
almost
but
not
quite
medicinal
taste
is
more
on
the
sweet
side
than
the
tart
side
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bith
thin
despite
this
i
prefer
this
cherry
blend
to
its
closest
counterpart
3
philosophers
i
enjoyed
it
and
picked
up
a
few
bottles
the
next
day
d
something
nice
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
or
with
dessert
not
something
i
would
sit
back
and
drink
all
night
long
notes
i
would
love
to
have
the
brown
ale
that
this
is
based
off
of
this
beer
the
brown
ale
with
cherries
added
is
excellent
drinkability
is
modest
kasteel
rouge
makes
a
fine
desert
beer
and
one
chalice
goes
down
nicely
then
again
im
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
d
this
is
a
great
desert
beer
to
be
savored
on
a
full
stomach
its
rich
and
sugary
and
that
kills
any
sort
of
session
potential
but
as
a
decadent
treat
its
outstanding
d
again
a
pleasing
beer
for
the
occasion
but
one
is
suitable
this
beer
poured
a
clear
very
dark
cherry
red
color
and
formed
a
small
very
pink
bubbly
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbon
is
present
an
aroma
of
cherries
cherry
pie
cherry
cough
syrup
etc
the
flavor
was
of
cherry
some
woodiness
and
oddly
just
a
hint
of
carmel
or
maybe
chocolate
masked
by
the
cherry
the
body
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
tart
a
nice
beer
from
a
pretty
consistant
brewer
verdict
id
be
lying
if
i
didnt
say
that
i
loved
this
beer
it
would
definitely
make
a
good
dessert
beer
depending
on
the
dessert
entree
ive
never
rated
anything
in
the
category
its
in
that
high
but
i
have
to
give
this
high
marks
for
what
it
is
feel
free
to
disagree
not
very
complex
and
kind
of
disappointing
but
not
a
terrible
beer
either
i
just
had
higher
expectations
lightbodied
and
a
tad
boozy
as
it
progresses
becomes
more
like
a
spiked
cherry
cough
drop
as
it
goes
on
i
cant
see
drinking
much
of
this
but
its
fine
for
what
it
claims
to
be
its
no
lambic
but
its
better
than
many
fruit
wheat
beers
ive
had
d
an
interesting
concoction
actually
tastes
more
like
a
cocktail
than
a
beer
like
a
fruity
mixed
drink
that
conan
likes
but
i
really
didnt
want
more
than
one
in
the
end
definitely
not
one
of
my
preferred
beer
styles
but
i
still
say
that
this
is
a
well
done
beer
not
as
deep
in
cherry
flavor
as
new
glarus
belgian
red
but
slightly
more
beer
like
which
i
actually
prefer
more
still
i
cant
see
many
occasions
when
i
would
want
to
drink
another
of
these
but
if
youre
into
cherries
or
different
styles
of
beer
you
owe
to
yourself
to
try
this
at
least
once
i
usually
enjoy
big
full
bodied
malty
sweet
beers
this
one
has
some
good
qualities
but
just
doesnt
quite
hit
the
spot
for
me
beautiful
cherry
red
and
perfect
cherry
in
nose
that
wafts
cherry
a
few
feetcherry
lace
medium
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
this
one
is
fresh
tastya
bit
of
woodiness
not
too
tart
second
to
new
belgium
in
authentic
and
complete
taste
solid
real
and
unique
d
i
believe
brouwerij
van
honsebrouck
n
v
tried
to
make
black
cherry
soda
into
a
beer
great
success
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
hmm
overall
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
the
tartness
is
just
becoming
too
much
i
drink
this
without
any
food
and
i
think
that
on
the
whole
that
this
is
a
beer
that
should
only
be
drank
with
food
it
would
also
make
a
good
reduction
sauce
since
it
is
rather
flavorful
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
a
duck
or
a
pork
on
the
whole
def
on
that
needs
paired
though
and
would
not
really
want
to
drink
one
alone
again
pours
a
dark
red
cough
syrupbeet
juice
color
with
a
light
graypink
head
the
aroma
is
clean
sugary
cherry
juice
theres
a
hint
of
vanillaspicy
stuff
in
the
background
but
its
a
reach
this
is
a
very
simple
straightforward
aroma
on
the
palate
initially
a
touch
bitter
with
a
cherry
underpinning
thats
only
slightly
tart
cherry
sweetness
comes
on
around
the
midpalate
then
dries
out
a
touch
leaving
some
unpleasant
bitter
woody
tastes
behind
at
the
finish
theres
an
underlying
sweetness
and
juicyness
that
is
inline
with
the
note
on
the
bottle
saying
that
plain
cherry
juice
is
added
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
an
odd
blend
of
beersmooth
and
juicesmooth
with
only
a
slight
bit
of
carbonation
overall
theres
not
much
to
recommend
this
its
fruitiness
lacks
complexity
and
perhaps
due
to
the
fruit
juice
addition
theres
little
beer
character
that
actually
shows
through
pours
burgundy
with
a
purple
tinged
head
that
has
some
decent
inital
head
but
that
fades
pretty
quickly
to
settle
to
a
ring
deep
deep
aromas
of
cherry
and
cherry
heering
with
a
background
smell
of
cough
syrup
some
slightly
sour
winey
smells
on
the
very
tail
end
tastes
somewhat
like
cherrry
cough
syrup
as
well
but
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
runs
through
it
and
saves
the
day
somewhat
a
touch
of
fresh
cherry
flavor
floats
above
the
more
medicinal
taste
mouthfeel
is
super
sweet
and
that
combined
with
the
low
carbonation
level
makes
this
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
not
balanced
or
subtle
at
all
and
extreme
in
all
the
wrong
directions
drinkability
very
high
surprising
complexity
for
such
a
sweet
fruit
beer
which
is
a
good
thing
the
high
abv
may
limit
what
you
would
want
but
a
very
good
example
within
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
vinuous
notes
and
standout
wild
cherries
that
linger
to
a
sweet
cupcake
finish
not
overly
thick
which
is
a
relief
because
excessive
body
in
fruit
beers
can
sometimes
translate
as
syrupyness
i
dont
know
that
i
could
drink
another
of
these
but
it
certainly
was
worthwhile
reviewer
notes
i
rating
this
brew
based
soley
on
its
merits
as
a
fruit
beer
not
a
belgian
beer
this
is
definitely
way
too
easy
drinking
not
so
sweet
that
it
becomes
cloying
this
beer
just
disappears
from
my
glass
very
simplistic
in
its
one
dimensional
cherry
character
but
still
certainly
enjoyable
if
you
like
cherries
i
certainly
had
no
problem
consuming
my
330ml
bottle
of
this
the
flavor
was
incredible
i
expected
something
like
a
lembic
but
the
cherry
flavor
was
perfect
and
not
that
sweet
at
all
this
is
a
good
predinner
drink
i
think
the
flavor
might
be
a
little
too
much
to
have
with
a
meal
drinks
fairly
easy
might
get
old
after
a
while
due
to
the
sweetness
dryness
but
this
worked
for
me
my
wife
dug
it
too
stubby
bottle
pours
a
clear
ruby
body
with
a
small
and
fleeting
pink
head
speckles
of
lace
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
goblet
aroma
is
sweet
black
cherries
and
some
earthy
yeast
light
medium
body
has
a
restrained
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
and
tart
cherry
almost
candylike
the
cherry
overwhelms
the
subdued
malt
and
hops
presence
the
8
abv
is
not
noticed
if
you
like
sweet
and
tart
cherries
you
will
enjoy
this
one
something
i
picked
for
me
and
the
wife
to
enjoy
today
and
i
have
to
say
i
really
impressed
with
this
cherry
infused
beer
poured
into
a
small
tulip
glass
a
mauve
maroon
color
with
a
large
blooming
pink
head
that
clung
nicely
to
the
glass
as
it
settled
slowly
wow
the
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
is
almost
candylike
well
like
a
sweet
tartneither
overpowers
the
other
a
dessert
beer
to
behold
but
not
wimpy
afterall
it
is
8alc
but
the
candied
sweetness
along
with
somewaht
lactic
tartness
in
the
finish
just
makes
you
wanna
drink
more
its
almost
addicting
fruit
infused
beers
when
done
right
are
awesome
and
this
along
with
founders
rubeus
may
be
my
two
favoritetake
it
for
what
it
is
and
you
will
thoroughly
enjoy
it
a
bit
sour
but
not
too
bad
note
not
nearly
as
good
from
a
bottle
kastell
rouge
pours
a
deep
dark
cherry
red
with
a
minimal
ring
of
pink
head
circleing
the
glass
from
a
brown
11
2
ounce
bottle
i
really
like
the
smell
they
nailed
black
cherry
the
taste
is
nice
too
it
has
a
nice
cherry
flavor
tart
and
sour
balanced
nicely
with
sweet
definitely
not
cloying
or
medicinal
which
could
easily
happen
this
isnt
something
i
would
drink
often
but
frankly
i
think
its
quite
enjoyable
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
i
have
my
reservations
any
time
i
hear
the
word
cherry
in
a
description
of
a
beer
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
finish
is
a
little
sticky
sweet
and
cola
like
ample
carbonation
and
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
had
no
idea
what
the
abv
was
when
i
tried
it
i
didnt
notice
the
alcohol
until
long
after
the
beer
was
gone
it
was
very
good
and
very
drinkable
i
could
have
easily
spent
the
night
drinking
nothing
but
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
cherry
color
the
head
creamy
and
reddish
purple
in
color
the
size
modest
as
it
depletes
and
the
lace
forms
a
thin
but
concealing
sheet
nose
is
steeped
in
sweet
ripe
cherries
with
a
nutlike
undertone
tart
and
crisp
a
real
delight
for
the
ocular
and
olfactory
senses
start
is
ripe
sweet
fruit
at
the
front
tart
at
the
back
hint
bitterness
also
present
top
is
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
stinging
acidity
tart
cherry
flavor
carries
to
the
end
not
a
hint
of
the
eight
percent
alcohol
what
a
hoot
overall
recommended
for
certain
circumstances
could
also
be
a
good
crossover
beer
im
convinced
that
this
brewery
could
pee
in
a
bottle
cap
it
and
it
would
turn
out
great
they
simply
can
do
no
wrong
this
beer
proves
it
a
burst
of
tart
cherry
aromas
fill
the
nose
followed
up
by
a
vineous
woodiness
and
sharp
berry
character
the
beer
looks
darker
than
most
fruit
lambics
but
still
take
on
a
red
hue
laced
well
and
held
a
firm
foamstand
throughout
flavors
of
tart
nearly
sour
cherries
swirl
around
a
solid
malt
base
to
amplify
a
sweet
savory
winelike
complexity
a
firm
hop
bitterness
combines
with
a
sharp
astringency
to
temper
the
intense
fruitiness
and
sweetness
alcholols
are
hardly
detectable
but
thin
the
beer
for
ease
in
drinking
finishes
with
a
candycherry
flavor
and
a
biteybitterness
it
certainly
picks
up
on
a
lot
of
framboisetype
character
but
a
bit
more
malty
and
less
intense
sourness
might
make
it
prefered
o
despite
being
my
favorite
of
the
cherry
nonlambic
beers
i
can
only
drink
one
of
these
in
an
evening
but
i
would
certainly
return
for
another
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
me
though
it
isnt
necessarily
drinkable
by
beer
standards
it
tastes
like
a
really
awsome
slurpee
hardcore
beer
zealots
might
frown
on
this
one
for
abandoning
their
hops
and
malts
for
overly
masking
cherries
i
like
it
because
it
tastes
like
liquid
cherry
candy
and
has
8
best
candy
ever
overall
i
love
this
beer
what
more
can
i
say
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
red
color
with
a
mediun
pink
head
that
has
ok
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
comprised
of
sweet
cherry
juice
not
very
tart
at
all
just
sweet
reminds
me
of
a
cherry
syrup
the
flavor
is
all
cherry
slightly
tart
and
quite
sweet
again
reminds
me
of
cherry
juice
leaves
a
cherry
flavor
on
the
tongue
effervescent
the
body
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
not
even
slightly
obvious
tasty
brew
pours
a
deep
mahogany
red
with
a
quickly
receding
pink
head
i
am
a
big
fan
of
flemish
sours
and
was
looking
to
try
something
new
when
i
picked
this
up
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
figured
it
would
be
similar
to
a
lambic
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
fist
off
it
completely
lacks
any
subletly
or
complexity
it
smacks
you
with
cherries
throughout
its
strong
and
malty
which
i
like
but
has
a
harsh
medicinal
aftertaste
to
be
blunt
its
like
drinking
carbonated
cough
syrup
i
would
pass
this
one
by
you
can
do
much
better
for
the
price
good
stuff
nice
for
dessert
or
a
relaxing
nightcap
overall
im
pretty
dissappointed
in
this
one
with
the
kasteel
name
i
was
expecting
a
good
well
made
fruit
beer
not
another
lambic
ripoff
like
those
that
they
bottle
with
the
st
louis
name
the
smell
alone
is
enough
to
turn
you
off
all
that
being
said
this
could
be
great
to
cook
with
i
can
think
of
a
dozen
or
more
marinades
and
recipes
that
this
would
be
great
for
perhaps
ill
buy
another
to
toy
around
with
pours
a
very
clear
candy
apple
amber
in
color
topped
with
a
dense
frothy
twofingered
head
the
color
of
the
head
is
a
blend
of
light
tan
and
red
for
what
i
might
best
describe
as
a
dusty
pink
baby
owing
to
the
color
of
the
head
i
had
to
check
the
label
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
artificial
color
or
sweetener
in
this
one
new
glarus
light
fruity
apple
notes
with
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
in
the
background
pretty
much
what
it
says
on
the
box
if
you
want
a
glass
of
champagne
in
a
12
oz
bottle
this
is
your
beer

ok
beer
but
i
like
others
better
from
this
brewer
overall
its
refreshing
but
lacks
complexity
not
the
best
beer
from
unibroue
it
was
bright
it
was
crisp
it
was
unique
it
had
the
essence
of
its
fruity
notes
without
having
a
heavy
amount
of
sweetness
im
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
so
that
is
probably
reflected
here
having
said
that
the
apple
flavor
is
light
well
balanced
and
pours
rather
well
belgian
cider
whatever
its
just
ok
a
very
carbonated
tasty
fruit
beer
that
i
would
have
again
fizzy
apple
with
no
bang
and
not
much
to
mention
disappointing
from
unibroue
and
i
like
them
and
fruit
beers
in
general
overall
good
brew
little
pricey
considering
the
other
beers
unibroue
puts
out
there
for
the
same
price
share
with
a

and
drink

an
a
éphémère
pomme
is
one
of
the
best
appleflavoured
beers
ive
had
but
to
be
fair
i
dont
recall
ever
actually
liking
one
very
much
until
now
this
is
exceedingly
good
for
a
fruit
beer
and
i
absolutely
love
the
crisp
mouthfeel
but
its
still
not
my
favourite
in
the
éphémère
series
as
with
most
of
unibroues
flagship
products
this
one
has
a
strong
belgian
ale
vibe
so
if
youre
looking
for
something
along
that
line
with
a
decent
fruity
kick
this
is
a
worthwhile
option
id
get
this
one
again
but
id
still
rather
drink
a
good
craft
cider
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
even
with
the
355
that
i
gave
to
that
beer
i
will
say
no
don
t
take
me
wrong
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
it
doesn
t
have
that
thing
for
me
to
recommend
to
give
it
a
try
overall
this
isnt
bad
beer
but
the
apple
flavor
is
just
too
non
existent
for
my
tastes
o
i
thought
the
apple
would
be
overwhelming
but
this
is
surprisingly
wellbalanced
otherwise
a
fantastic
belgianstyle
pale
or
tripel
with
a
twist
interesting
and
glad
i
tried
it
probably
my
favorite
artificially
flavored
beer
product
the
yeast
enhances
the
apple
in
a
buttery
pie
crust
kind
of
way
very
awesome

b
okay
simply
a
light
summer
beer
with
a
big
dose
of
green
apple
up
front
would
try
again
on
tap
but
would
probably
just
prefer
some
franziskaner
060912
at
shortys
nyc
had
the
bottle
liked
it
still
waiting
to
kiss
a
girl
on
tap
its
a
much
brighter
flavor
not
too
sweet
but
the
green
apple
essence
is
in
the
house
nice
texture
not
too
syrupy
now
to
try
it
wone
of
shortys
pork
roast
pork
sammies
o
onenoted
not
something
id
reach
for
regularly
but
credit
is
due
for
the
fact
that
this
is
a
green
apple
beer
not
trying
to
disguise
itself
as
something
else
o
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
good
fruit
beer
and
very
refreshing
this
would
be
good
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
seems
more
like
an
appleflavored
soft
drink
than
a
beer
to
me
its
probably
decent
for
the
style
it
is
intended
to
be
a
fruit
beer
after
all
but
just
not
my
idea
of
what
a
beer
should
be
im
also
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flavor
of
belgian
yeast
if
you
like
belgians
andor
fruit
beers
give
it
a
try
a
good
solid

well
balanced

o
nothing
wrong
here
just
not
terribly
interesting
i
love
green
apples
and
apple
beer
seems
like
a
good
idea
but
this
is
fairly
plain
poured
from
a
bottle
has
a
whiteyellow
color
like
white
grape
juice
and
a
very
healthy
white
foam
smells
like
sour
fruit
not
unpleasant
but
not
great
the
flavor
is
more
complex
the
apple
is
most
dominant
but
isnt
overpowering
the
beer
is
more
dry
than
sweet
even
a
little
tart
has
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
flavor
is
a
little
lacking
in
some
regards
but
the
beer
is
still
pretty
enjoyable
o
mouthfeel
could
be
better
smoother
but
theres
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
fruits
and
spices
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
grew
before
receding
into
a
foam
of
white
leaving
no
lacing
it
looks
quite
good
for
a
fruit
beer
like
a
tripel

begins
with
heavy

apple
notes
on

this
is
a

with

to
give
it

its

are
crisp

the

helps
the
other

its
a
good

beer
and
quite
well

overall
an
incredibly
refreshing

when
im
in

weizen
glass
o
enjoyed
draft
three
times
bottle
exceeded
draft
experience
today
o
as
i
imagined
the
apple
dominates
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
beer
although
it
is
not
overpowering
or
overly
sweet
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
o
this
is
a
quality
beer
but
fruit
style
beers
are
not
high
on
my
list
this
beer
is
a
lively
drink
that
is
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
lightness
that
is
cheerful
and
vibrant
this
was
served
with
a
slightly
goldened
straw
color
with
a
head
that
didnt
show
much
retention
smell
was
apple
and
orange
and
there
are
flavors
of
apple
malt
citrus
and
minimal
hops
in
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
thin
but
not
too
thin
and
crisp
but
also
is
very
acidic
so
much
so
that
i
could
feel
it
burn
my
esophagus
on
the
way
down
overall
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
as
it
offers
overt
fruit
flavors
while
not
being
too
sweet
and
its
not
too
thin
but
is
it
worth
the
8
that
i
paid
for
a
tall
glass
of
the
beer
well
no
poured
into
a
pint
glass
let
me
tell
you
ladies
and
gents
if
you
like
apples
then
your
gonna
love
this
beer
its
ok
for
me
not
great
not
awful
if
this
beer
was
a
women
i
presume
that
id
take
er
home
to
mamma
then
maybe
a
date
to
taco
bell
or
wendys
idk
as
always
everyone
merica
o
by
far
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
had
not
artificial
and
not
a
wine
cooler
just
a
great
beer
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
finishes
somewhat
dry
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
now
that
i
know
what
to
expect
overall
a
nice
spring
and
summer
beer
i
think
that
unibroue
got
it
right
for
want
they
wanted
to
share
serving
type
bottle
overall
not
into
many
fruit
beer
but
this
one
i
like
would
buy
this
beer
in
the
future
overall
not
a
bad
summer
beer
but
kinda
sweet
for
me
if
i
wanted
something
fruity
id
rather
have
a
lambic
but
id
try
it
again
if
someone
gave
me
one
like
they
did
this
one
overall
the
quality
is
there
and
the
aroma
is
great
but
this
drink
is
meant
for
people
that
do
not
drink
ipas
and
who
enjoy
sweet
drinks
overall
this
appears
to
be
your
average
fruit
beer
very
sweet
with
the
character
of
the
dominating
fruit
in
this
case
apples
and
then
not
anything
else
one
or
two
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
would
be
nice
but
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
too
much
after
a
two
and
i
need
something
with
some
hops
in
it
typical
for
the
style
try
it
once
this
is
so
much
better
than
apple
ciders
great

for

flavor
without

through

its
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
soft
and
subtle
vanilla

on

you

try

this
is
one
unique
tasting
beer
apple
nose
of
course
with
hints
of
bananabubble
gum
like
a
combination
heffecider
very
tasty
but
a
little
on
the
thinside
the
finish
is
quicka
hint
of
citrus
tang
then
its
gone
unfortunate
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
shell
love
it
and
so
will
i
o
hmm
im
sorry
but
i
cant
put
this
in
the
fruit
beerale
category
even
with
all
the
apple
notes
going
on
there
is
still
a
wheat
presence
and
its
noticeable
its
reminds
me
a
lot
of
their
witbier
with
a
big
apple
punch
so
i
cant
get
past
that
and
i
sure
as
hell
dont
get
a
fruit
beer
with
this
is
it
fruity
well
yea
but
it
has
enough
wheat
going
on
to
be
just
some
old
fruit
beer
is
it
world
class
as
world
class
as
it
can
get
a
damn
fine
brewery
with
an
idea
and
they
perfected
it
problem
is
thats
not
much
in
terms
of
what
it
is
i
love
unibroue
and
this
isnt
a
complete
waste
its
as
good
as
anyone
will
ever
get
with
a
wheat
ale
with
apples
and
coriander
lol
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
an
a
brew
either
just
a
very
good
brewery
with
an
idea
ill
drink
one
in
spring
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
my
wife
does
love
it
though
and
she
hates
beer
of
all
kinds
lmao
d
overall
acceptable
and
tastes
but
not
outstanding
in
any
way
maybe
a
good
transition
beer
to
or
from
ciders
o
this
is
ridiculous
why
have
i
put
down
so
many
words
about
this
beer
oh
well
would
i
have
it
again
maybe
on
tap
but
probably
not
i
likes
it
very
refreshing
and
crisp
thanks
for
trying
unibroue
but
this
is
not
your
best
effort
if
the
cassis
cranberry
and
peach
beers
were
anything
like
this
i
can
see
why
it
was
narrowed
down
to
one
but
i
am
curious
why
this
one
if
this
is
the
best
of
the
four
thats
too
bad
now
i
want
to
get
a
bottle
of
the
raspberry
know
anyone
in
quebec
o
i
think
it
is
nice
the
apple
flavor
is
not
the
center
of
this
beer
the
apple
supports
the
malt
which
i
feel
tastes
like
plain
beer
it
isnt
phenomenal
but
i
enjoy
that
it
is
a
fruit
beer
that
isnt
completely
about
the
fruit
a
very
well
made
beer
certainly
not
for
everyone
but
unique
as
fruit
beers
go
since
it
isnt
super
sweet
the
pour
is
hazy
and
very
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
lively
white
head
fizzy
and
maybe
pushing
three
inches
tall
the
nose
is
fruity
like
green
apple
skins
but
not
the
flesh
there
is
very
little
sweetness
or
tartness
in
the
nose
just
sort
of
that
apple
essence
also
a
nice
light
wheat
malt
base
and
a
fun
bright
belgian
yeast
strain
the
flavor
is
decidedly
apple
forward
but
its
like
granny
smith
apples
or
something
not
too
sweet
not
too
tart
nice
and
clean
and
crisp
floral
blossom
apple
and
hop
profile
is
more
robust
than
anticipated
and
it
works
well
to
sharpen
things
up
long
curious
finish
where
the
yeast
takes
over
i
liked
the
flavor
of
this
quite
a
lot
despite
what
the
ba
community
seems
to
think
its
something
different
for
sure
but
it
is
absolutely
artfully
made
whether
you
like
it
or
not
awesome
feel
with
upbeat
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
but
delicate
texture
it
really
works
especially
in
early
spring
here
seems
just
right
to
me
to
the
point
this
is
a
beercooler
it
is
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
otherwise
it
is
not
for
me
pours
a
pale
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
at
pour
but
disppates
quickly
almost
like
a
soda
a
thin
layer
of
head
remains
at
the
end
fine
carbonation
and
can
be
excited
with
a
swirl
smell
is
fruity
green
apple
is
present
and
maybe
some
lemon
or
other
light
citrus
taste
is
good
green
apple
is
present
and
mutes
some
of
the
other
normal
beer
flavors
still
good
a
beerdrinkers
fruit
brew
would
be
very
good
during
hot
weather
ill
just
note
that
the
bottle
call
cellared
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
one
dimensional
but
very
nicely
put
together
would
be
wonderful
on
a
hot
day
during
the
summer
btw
unless
you
have
vicegrip
hands
i
recommend
a
pair
of
pliers
to
help
you
uncork
this
one
o
the
least
most
complex
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
sour
green
apple
candy
thats
basically
all
there
is
in
both
aromaflavor
it
also
reminds
me
of
watermelon
bubblegum
luckily
i
love
both
so
i
cant
possible
give
this
a
bad
score
i
was
told
on
the
label
exactly
what
it
was
and
i
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
complexity
be
damned
this
beer
is
simply
awesome
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
apple
was
a
little
consuming
but
it
was
still
a
nice
easy
drinker
o
when
taken
for
what
it
is
its
quite
good
when
compared
to
the
quality
and
depth
of
beers
of
other
styles
it
falls
short
overall
better
than
i
originally
though
it
would
be
more
sessionable
and
not
as
sweet
and
sticky
as
other
fruit
beers
i
would
pick
this
above
most
hard
ciders
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
cider
very
refreshing
and
light
tasting
beer
it
is
a
very
solid
midpoint
between
a
sweet
cider
and
a
glass
of
champagne
bottle
sample
light
golden
color
slightly
cloudy
small
white
head
ripe
fruits
on
the
nose
with
some
white
wine
like
aroma
chardonnay
baked
apple
flavors
with
some
yeast
light
artificial
notes
no
bitterness
what
so
ever
light
body
not
rich
enough
in
malts
im
gonna
go
ahead
and
say
this
was
a
solid
beer
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
flavor
but
there
wasnt
anything
offputting
about
it
and
that
was
clutch
given
the
lightness
i
picked
up
on
the
apple
and
the
spice
as
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
was
on
the
money
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
either
not
particularly
recommended
after
nosing
this
beer
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
was
hoping
for
some
sweet
and
sour
fruit
notes
to
be
battling
for
supremacy
on
my
palate
unfortunately
what
i
got
was
a
lightbodied
appletasting
beverage
that
while
refreshing
and
pleasing
to
drink
did
not
excite
my
palate
or
challenge
me
the
way
i
had
hoped
o
this
was
a
tough
beer
to
drink
and
i
could
barely
finish
this
one
12
oz
if
you
want
something
sweet
than
i
would
recommend
going
for
a
cider
and
if
you
want
something
carbonated
go
for
champagne
this
beer
didnt
do
anything
for
me
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
but
no
other
time
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
shocking
from
this
brewery
too
much
fruit
like
trying
to
spice
up
bud
light
with
an
overpowering
fruit
and
a
lot
more
carbonation
i
would
not
recommend
buying
this
it
is
worth
trying
once
maybe
although
even
that
im
unsure
of
d
im
usually
a
fan
of
unibroue
offerings
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
average
to
below
average
in
all
categories
other
than
aroma
this
is
not
one
that
ill
be
indulging
in
again
overall
dissapointing
i
dont
this
is
like
a
light
wheat
beer
with
candy
apple
syrup
poured
in
i
get
more
wheat
than
i
do
apple
which
is
a
god
send
but
they
dont
mesh
as
well
as
i
thought
they
would
its
like
a
yeast
heavy
belgian
pale
not
spicy
just
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
uber
sweet
candy
apple
trying
to
do
something
good
othe
nose
is
good
but
the
apple
notes
dominate
too
much
definitely
a
onceinawhile
kinda
beer
but
offers
a
unique
and
complex
flavor
compared
to
many
other
fruit
beers
good
stuff
overall
definitely
different
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
o
i
will
buy
some
granny
smith
apple
cider
next
time
not
worth
the
price
this
is
a
liquid
jolly
rancher
candy
its
sour
apples
throughout
ill
pass
in
the
future
i
think
this
could
use
more
carbonation
more
apple
and
less
funk
that
being
said
all
in
all
this
isnt
bad
and
i
didnt
do
this
beer
any
favors
by
forgetting
about
it
for
a
year
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
carbonation
bubbles
are
very
prickly
on
the
tongue
there
is
almost
nothing
to
the
super
light
body
on
this
one
pours
out
a
bright
clear
golden
color
like
alot
of
lite
beers
look
the
head
settles
quickly
smell
is
like
rotten
apple
juice
and
dirty
wet
rags
taste
isnt
any
better
in
fact
its
worse
very
medicine
like
i
dont
think
the
spices
compliment
this
beer
at
all
not
happy
with
this
purchase
and
dont
recommend
anyone
buy
it

d
very
drinkable
very
fruity
refreshing
and
sweet
tasty
very
appley
if
you
like
apple
juice
pick
some
up
o
ive
enjoyed
this
as
a
fruit
beer
its
simple
clean
and
crisp
the
mineral
water
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
approachable
o
meh
overall
not
too
bad
certainly
drinkable
but
these
fruit
beers
are
just
for
trying
to
me
these
arent
regulars
overall
a
beer
for
cider
drinkers
i
liked
its
light
mouthfell
but
lacked
balance
and
depth
thou
cherry
notes
and
bubblegum
really
stuck
out
on
the
finish
when
paired
with
cave
aged
gruyere
overall
pretty
good
i
am
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
sweet
fruitflavoured
beers
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
such
a
thing
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
white
head
strong
slightly
sweet
aroma
has
a
firm
overtone
of
sour
apple
and
a
hint
of
malt
flavor
is
mainly
sour
apple
almost
like
a
hard
cider
with
an
undertone
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
coriander
firmbodied
texture
is
rather
fizzy
though
the
fizz
doesnt
go
far
down
the
pipes
not
great
but
definitely
worth
at
least
a
try
o
i
enjoyed
this
interesting
brew
and
could
really
appreciate
it
on
a
hot
day
realizing
on
the
back
porch
a
deffinate
summer
treat
that
i
will
probably
revisit

with
a
fluffy
white
light
head
of
about
a
half
an
inch
the
head
disappears
as
you
drink
and
there
was
not
a
hint
of
lacing
throughout
consumption
this
thing
is
pungent
of
granny
smith
apples
i
can
smell
it
being
poured
and
i
am
a
few
feet
away
upon
closer
inspection
the
nose
is
soursweet
granny
smith
apple
with
a
mild
roasted
grain
backbone
that
can
be
found
if
you
dig
around
a
bit
flavors
are
completely
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
the
backbone
is
more
of
a
roasted
apple
sweetness
with
none
of
the
tart
that
i
was
expecting
from
the
granny
smith
nose
slightly
acidic
highlight
throught
with
a
tree
and
pollen
highlight
throughout
it
almost
tastes
like
an
apple
blossom
smells
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
aftertaste
is
crisp
and
slightly
spicy
with
some
peppery
notes
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
too
leading
to
a
slightly
limp
nondescript
finish
easy
enough
to
drink
but
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
are
all
over
the
place
poured
in
a
glass
the
colour
is
a
warm
daffidile
yellow
pleasant
to
the
eye
the
smell
is
fruity
with
banana
orange
tones
the
taste
is
neither
bitter
or
leaves
an
unpleasant
after
taste
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
complements
most
foods
especially
indian
food
some
how
the
spicy
veggie
food
matches
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
m
light
and
fluffy
with
a
perfectly
petite
carbonation
very

from
a
12
oz
bottle
received
in
a
beer
of
the
month
6
pack
from
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
va
into
a
snifter
poured
a
cloudy
dark
straw
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
left
some
lacing
smells
of
green
apples
and
light
malt
but
the
apple
definitely
dominates
tastes
of
a
more
begiumstyle
malt
with
hints
of
sour
green
apple
but
less
than
what
was
expected
goes
down
easy
for
a
medium
style
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
and
a
fruit
beer
that
kinda
surprised
me
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
fruit
beer
by
unibroue
this
is
not
overally
sweet
which
makes
this
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
like
the
sweet
and
tangysour
characteristics
to
this
beer
worth
a
try
oa
unique
beer
lots
of
apple
flavor
with
hints
of
bitter
orange
its
a
bit
odd
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
combination
of
flavors
doa
im
more
in
love
with
the
smell
than
the
taste
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
a
midway
between
a
wine
and
an
apple
cider
and
beer
give
to
people
who
like
smooth
and
who
like
wines
the
flavors
were
a
bit
thin
its
champagnelike
carbonation
was
welcomed
and
had
some
musty
character
to
it
i
liked
the
tap
version
better
probably
wont
buy
again
d
dull
and
thin
not
having
the
best
beer
day
an
unusual
occurrence
a
beer
that
seems
pretty
much
average
in
every
category
certainly
not
my
favorite
unibroue
offering
although
i
see
the
appeal
in
it
overall
not
bad
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
drink
this
again
paired
with
the
right
food
o
good
beer
i
like
the
regular
unflavored
better
though
still
good
very
different
beer
and
not
too
bad
overall
i
give
points
to
achieving
an
aroma
that
ive
never
experienced
in
a
beer
before
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
still
a
beer
and
it
needs
to
taste
like
one
the
palate
just
suffers
too
much
from
a
thinness
of
flavor
and
texture
as
one
who
keeps
one
foot
in
wine
as
well
as
beer
however
i
can
see
this
having
a
lot
of
potential
being
paired
alongside
of
a
salad
or
simply
prepared
white
fish
o
pretty
simple
fruit
beer
almost
all
apple
tasty
and
refreshing
enough
though
o
this
is
a
really
good
fruit
beer
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
d
its
highly
drinkable
and
i
appreciate
that
the
beer
imparts
a
very
very
fresh
apple
flavor
it
doesnt
seem
artificial
at
all
i
do
think
however
that
it
suffers
from
simplicity
and
mediocre
quality
overall
it
reminds
me
of
champaigne
not
that
ive
had
much
champaigne
great
fruit
beer
on
the
downside
it
seems
to
go
flat
really
quickly
beer
is
light
in
body
that
is
cut
even
lighter
by
the
heavy
carbonation
the
fruit
is
all
forward
the
finish
is
grainy
and
sweet
a
mild
aftertaste
appears
a
little
acidity
from
the
grains
i
have
no
idea
when
this
was
bottled
since
i
could
not
locate
a
date
stamp
but
this
bottle
was
typical
of
my
experiences
with
this
beer
all
in
all
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
expected
a
more
complex
and
intense
ale
especially
considering
this
beer
came
from
the
same
brewery
that
makes
la
fin
du
monde
possibly
the
greatest
and
most
complex
tripel
on
the
planet
this
just
did
not
live
up
to
anywhere
near
those
standards
in
reflection
this
beer
feels
little
more
than
a
nice
and
light
golden
ale
with
some
apple
flavor
and
that
weird
cheese
astringency
not
well
balanced
and
not
very
flavorful
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
such
a
great
brewery
but
everyone
falls
short
sometimes
o
as
far
as
a
fruit
beer
goes
i
guess
this
is
pretty
good
not
particularly
my
style
though
meh
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
or
style
pours
a
white
wine
white
grape
juice
color
crazy
amount
of
carbonation
creating
a
giant
head
atop
the
glass
smells
like
homemade
hard
cider
funky
spice
taste
has
a
crisp
apple
taste
and
finish
its
not
that
its
bad
its
just
that
theres
really
nothing
more
to
it
light
in
body
fizzy
sweet
and
dry
this
is
would
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
if
the
carbonation
werent
coming
through
my
nose
pretty
average
if
your
in
the
market
for
fruit
beers
or
lambics
i
got
this
in
a
unibroue
sampler
case
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
6
styles
in
the
case
and
the
only
one
i
wouldnt
buy
on
its
own
all
the
other
5
styles
are
amazing
o
a
decent
beer
mostly
pleasant
id
have
another
one
revisiting
one
of
the
few
fruited
beers
i
didnt
recoil
from
back
in
the
day
i
take
that
as
a
good
omen
for
this
time
well
see
it
pours
a
lightly
foggy
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
steadfast
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
green
apples
plenty
of
skin
involved
here
light
pear
wheat
banana
white
grape
vanilla
bean
and
whipped
cream
kinda
like
certain
scented
candles
ive
come
across
but
one
of
the
good
ones
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
granny
smith
apples
really
coming
to
the
fore
the
other
fruits
and
the
vanilla
are
cut
a
bit
but
still
make
discernible
appearances
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silkyish
feel
overall
a
pretty
solid
fruit
beer
but
not
necessarily
something
i
could
realistically
see
myself
drinking
all
that
much
of
o
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
since
im
fond
of
other
beers
from
this
brewery
like
maudite
and
la
fin
du
monde
but
it
doesnt
really
command
attention
like
the
other
ones
almost
watery
at
times
especially
when
it
starts
to
warm
this
is
a
good
solid
ale
simple
but
not
overly
complex
the
tartness
is
on
the
spot
it
could
be
better
but
is
still
worth
trying
nice
beer
would
be
nice
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
dr
incredibly
drinkable
and
with
an
average
abv
but
still
one
higher
than
other
equally
drinkable
fruit
beers
id
love
to
try
it
on
draught
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
use
to
try
to
transition
someone
from
macrolager
shite
or
to
try
to
get
the
missus
to
like
beer
the
price
is
rather
high
at
least
as
a
us
import
however
wow
what
a
unique
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
for
sure
and
i
feel
it
did
a
great
job
although
we
will
see
if
i
ever
pick
it
up
again
unless
i
have
a
specific
pairing
in
mind
o
the
ephemere
is
a
delightful
apple
flavored
belgian
style
ale
if
you
like
green
apple
flavors
you
will
like
this
beer
there
should
be
no
mistake
this
is
an
apple
beer
if
you
dont
like
fruit
beers
or
apple
flavors
you
wont
like
it
but
if
you
do
enjoy
o
relatively
weak
flavors
cannot
save
this
beer
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
again
split
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
couple
friends
despite
pouring
a
clear
gold
it
smells
a
bit
yeasty
the
beer
has
a
smooth
vanillawheat
background
like
their
witbier
over
the
malt
is
a
sweet
juicy
candy
apple
character
for
a
fruit
beer
this
has
a
great
balance
of
the
apple
and
malt
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
cider
overall
if
i
wanted
a
hard
cider
i
would
buy
a
hard
cider
it
dosent
really
taste
like
a
beer
and
it
isnt
even
that
cheap
pours
a
hazy
straw
a
white
14
head
sticks
around
no
lacing
green
apple
aroma
immediately
noticeable
upon
opening
bottle
spicy
yeastiness
some
bread
green
apple
forefront
in
the
flavor
sometimes
i
get
flavors
not
unlike
a
green
apple
jolly
rancher
some
spicy
phenols
light
malt
sweetness
doesnt
seem
full
flavored
to
me
sometimes
i
get
a
watery
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
because
it
is
different
and
decently
executed
the
green
apple
flavor
is
uncanny
and
fun
o
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
summertime
apple
ale
it
might
be
a
bit
too
musty
and
musky
for
some
but
i
like
it
o
it
saddens
me
that
i
have
to
go
to
the
usa
for
this
when
its
brewed
one
province
over
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
consumed
overall
drinkability
interesting
beer
but
i
think
one
is
enough
the
smell
is
really
good
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
in
comparison
the
good
aromas
in
the
smell
dont
show
up
in
the
taste
mind
you
the
taste
isnt
bad
just
not
at
the
same
level
as
the
smell
i
suspect
this
beer
would
be
best
with
a
fruit
cobbler
or
pie
maybe
with
a
meal
like
pork
but
by
itself
its
just
okay
the
beer
is
a
light
yellow
color
and
teeming
with
effervescence
nearly
transparent
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
does
indeed
bring
apples
spiked
apple
cider
apple
juice
with
a
light
helping
of
yeast
and
spice
beer
meet
apple
juice
the
body
is
relatively
thin
with
ample
carbonation
mild
alcohol
presence
a
good
apple
fruit
beer
one
is
plenty
you
must
like
apples
if
you
are
to
enjoy
this
beer
overall
drinkability
may
go
decent
with
a
pairing
but
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
interesting
qualities
neither
a
flute
nor
food
would
probably
save
this
beer
sort
of
like
the
michelob
ultra
for
fruit
beers
unibroue
i
am
disappoint
from
the
caged
corked
bottle
stamped
070512
sampled
on
september
17
2011
the
pour
is
a
hazy
cloudy
orangeamber
with
a
foamy
little
head
the
aromas
of
apples
lead
the
way
with
a
zingy
hoppiness
in
the
background
the
body
feels
in
the
lighttomedium
range
the
taste
is
also
full
of
apple
and
yeast
but
it
is
also
kind
of
doughlike
there
is
a
sharp
sour
hop
bite
at
the
end
adequate
but
not
my
style
o
overall
it
just
isnt
my
kind
of
beer
in
this
awkward
style
i
tend
to
review
even
more
to
my
tastes
and
i
just
dont
love
it
a
weird
collection
of
flavors
o
it
started
promising
but
this
strange
dusty
musty
taste
and
feel
keep
creeping
in
just
not
quite
up
to
the
standard
i
expect
from
unibroue
o
i
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
this
one
again
the
flavor
profile
was
too
sweet
and
had
a
fake
apple
quality
to
it
the
body
is
a
hazy
straw
color
and
has
some
yeasty
sediment
floating
around
in
it
the
head
is
perfectly
white
and
consists
of
numerous
relatively
large
bubbles
unfortunately
it
does
not
last
long
and
littletono
lacing
is
left
in
its
wake
the
smell
is
of
strong
apple
juice
sugar
some
spice
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
faint
straw
and
some
muddle
earthy
notes
taste
is
of
candy
apple
backed
by
prune
juice
really
this
tastes
like
carbonated
juice
and
not
at
all
like
a
beer
ive
encountered
before
all
i
can
think
about
is
an
apple
capri
sun
that
thirsty
children
would
drink
during
halftime
of
their
peewee
soccer
games
the
sugars
from
the
apple
and
prune
dominate
everything
except
a
minty
toothpaste
like
finish
quite
unpleasant
mouth
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
but
finishes
very
sticky
and
sugary
overall
this
is
a
very
odd
beer
and
not
one
ill
be
picking
up
again
any
time
soon
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
creative
brew
pretty
sweet
and
sour
but
not
overbearing
its
a
lot
like
a
strong
and
complex
apple
cider
but
you
can
still
easily
tell
its
a
beer
finger
of
white
froth
over
a
hazy
hue
reminiscent
of
a
pale
unripened
orange
the
nose
is
great
and
tickly
apple
sweetness
to
apple
tartness
with
faint
coriander
on
top
of
other
spices
deep
pulls
reveal
dark
berries
there
is
a
ton
going
on
in
this
aroma
and
its
all
stellar
i
just
dont
happen
to
have
the
exotic
fruit
knowledge
to
help
describe
what
all
is
there
flavors
are
loaded
with
fruitiness
and
they
all
stick
like
syrup
to
the
back
of
the
throat
super
heavy
carbonation
maybe
a
little
much
apple
tartness
and
sweet
pear
as
well
as
berries
bitterness
and
dry
malty
flavors
are
present
spicy
but
also
a
tad
musty
a
very
unique
and
complex
beer
but
not
all
of
it
works
well
together
light
refreshing
tangy
and
dry
all
come
to
mind
on
the
first
few
sips
carbonation
is
actually
not
as
high
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
is
more
on
the
medium
side
an
crisp
apple
taste
is
the
main
attraction
here
but
its
rounded
out
by
dryer
tastes
of
coriander
and
lemon
rind
syrupy
finish
but
dry
in
the
mouth
feel
overall
this
is
a
thirst
quencher
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
decent
complexity
but
probably
wont
buy
it
again
worth
the
try
though
d
delicious
apple
beer
its
highly
drinkable
this
is
the
first
bottle
that
ive
tried
but
i
had
this
on
tap
at
monks
cafe
in
philadelphia
a
few
weeks
ago
as
dessert
it
was
perfect
while
on
tap
it
might
have
been
a
bit
more
flavorful
the
bottle
is
very
close
and
stands
as
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
o
fantastic
beer
with
great
drinkability
perfect
for
summer
but
great
whenever
i
crave
this
often
and
have
never
been
disappointed
a
great
beer
this
beer
tastes
good
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
it
as
a
gateway
beer
for
newer
drinkers
o
honestly
still
not
too
sure
about
this
one
the
initial
taste
is
overpoweringly
sweet
yet
finishes
nicely
appearance
mouthfeel
smell
were
all
nice
but
its
the
taste
that
keeps
me
from
saying
it
was
a
good
beer
ill
have
to
come
back
to
this
one
not
a
cider
but
an
apple
beer
and
surprisingly
very
tasty
pours
a
hazy
strawyellow
with
a
thick
puff
of
white
head
that
mellows
out
after
a
minute
or
so
big
aroma
of
fresh
apples
and
apple
skins
and
not
in
a
bad
acetaldehyde
way
light
grains
and
herbs
in
the
background
tart
flavor
full
of
crisp
apples
pale
malts
and
light
sugars
take
the
edge
off
a
bit
midpalate
light
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
unlike
many
fruit
beers
o
well
now
its
an
odd
one
it
does
not
even
taste
like
beer
its
much
like
champagne
honestly
its
good
for
what
it
is
has
decent
taste
but
i
would
skip
it
ehhh
d
nice
change
of
pace
from
unibroues
beers
one
of
the
most
interesting
fruit
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
a
tasty
summer
drink
and
certainly
worth
a
try
a
bit
underrated
imo
and
would
certainly
be
appreciated
by
any
fan
of
fruit
infused
beers
this
has
a
thin
and
somewhat
spritzy
mouthfeel
and
is
easily
drinkable
but
it
begs
the
question
whats
the
point
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
very
unexciting
to
say
the
least
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
and
fizzy
there
was
just
a
touch
of
lacing
after
the
head
settled
but
not
much
more
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
great
i
love
the
smell
of
the
fresh
apple
blended
with
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
good
but
i
feel
the
apple
gets
a
little
lost
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
on
the
tongue
but
keeps
its
integrity
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew
ive
had
apple
beers
that
i
like
more
but
this
one
seems
to
be
the
most
popular
in
my
area
o
this
is
my
first
fruit
beer
so
i
unfortunately
cant
compare
this
to
other
of
this
style
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
however
this
is
a
refreshing
ale
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
d
delightful
not
something
i
could
do
very
often
but
as
a
dessert
beer
or
to
split
a
bottle
with
a
few
people
every
once
in
a
while
would
be
a
treat
the
beer
was
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
it
smells
of
fresh
sliced
green
apples
with
a
hint
of
yeast
hops
and
watermelon
the
taste
is
mostly
green
apple
with
belgian
yeast
and
banana
the
beer
is
light
and
soft
with
smooth
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
enjoyed
this
beer
even
though
the
only
reason
i
bought
it
is
because
my
girlfriend
wanted
to
try
an
apple
beerbut
the
apple
flavor
was
a
little
overpowering
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
i
was
expecting
something
tarter
and
more
carbonated
overall
it
is
ok
for
a
fruit
beer
overall
i
did
not
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
based
off
of
the
smell
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
the
nose
overall
interesting
with
the
light
body
starting
off
with
a
propel
type
of
taste
the
carbonation
then
jumps
out
and
adds
flavormouthfeel
during
the
last
steps
of
the
drink
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
for
anyone
have
had
many
times
now
and
ready
to
have
later
tonight
ontap
the
bridge
if
i
get
to
it
looking
forward
to
trying
another
unibroue
selection
tonight
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
you
can
only
have
one
or
two
but
the
selantro
balances
it
well
enough
to
make
it
drinkable
tasty
and
a
fine
session
beer
very
yeasty
on
the
palate
and
a
bitthin
in
the
midpalate
the
apple
is
there
but
its
nowhere
near
as
strong
as
it
is
on
the
nose
this
had
the
potential
to
be
sweet
but
its
very
nice
and
dry
and
mild
the
apple
does
contribute
some
tannins
and
the
mouthfeel
is
vigorous
carbonation
and
clean
refreshment
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
i
dig
it
a
lot
m
in
my
opinion
overcarbonated
but
the
dry
finish
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
a
decent
beer
and
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
soursbrett
beers
but
by
no
means
should
it
be
in
a
class
with
them
and
i
am
glad
it
is
not
belgian
fruit
beer
is
appropriate
so
i
am
glad
it
isnt
trying
to
be
something
it
is
not
overall
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
although
quite
bland
in
taste
light
fruity
aromas
some
apple
nice
carbonation
short
finish
i
dont
see
how
it
got
a
c
from
the
bros
would
be
lovely
when
it
gets
hotter
overall
wont
seek
out
a
second
time
if
im
offered
it
for
free
would
i
drink
it
sure
again
were
not
talking
drainpour
territory
here
more
along
the
lines
of
why
bother
just
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
much
better
stuff
out
there
in
general
and
from
unibroue
in
particular
o
just
too
much
in
the
way
of
bubbles
and
not
enough
in
the
way
of
flavor
or
aroma
o
overall
its
a
good
belgian
style
beer
and
the
apple
does
add
to
it
however
it
doesnt
stand
head
above
shoulders
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wont
be
picking
it
up
off
the
shelf
any
time
soon
taste
is
definitely
apple
fruity
at
times
it
seems
almost
cider
like
if
not
for
the
distinct
belgian
style
yeast
and
spice
light
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
explodes
in
the
mouth
and
fizzes
away
fast
but
id
say
its
a
tad
too
assertive
can
seem
thin
at
times
but
at
least
it
isnt
cloyingly
sweet
like
some
fruit
beers
can
be
o
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
needed
to
try
for
this
unibroue
gamut
im
running
at
the
moment
but
doesnt
stand
toward
the
top
of
that
list
overall
no
thanks
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
cidersparkling
white
wine
than
an
actual
beer
i
give
it
credit
for
trying
to
be
different
but
there
is
a
line
to
draw
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
refreshing
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
great
sour
apple
flavor
does
not
taste
much
different
than
a
hard
cider
but
does
has
some
unique
yeasty
qualities
if
it
werent
an
awful
beer
it
would
be
extremely
drinkable
it
however
is
awful
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
makes
it
refreshing
but
honestly
too
light
for
my
preferences
overall
a
good
fruit
beer
which
honestly
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
thought
id
give
it
a
try
and
wasnt
too
disappointed
o
bought
this
on
a
whim
since
ive
never
seen
it
in
our
grocery
store
first
bottle
i
had
i
hated
the
second
time
i
had
it
i
had
it
with
spicy
food
and
i
think
it
helped
very
much
like
cider
in
my
opinion
so
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
for
those
who
dont
like
ciders
or
apples
i
could
imagine
this
one
being
a
nice
patio
beer
with
the
light
drinkability
providing
a
nice
thirstquenching
power
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
and
complex
it
has
light
apple
notes
mixed
with
alcohol
and
yeast
wow
its
like
a
belgian
beer
was
mixed
with
granny
smith
apples
opening
the
bottle
the
apple
aroma
is
very
noticeable
but
it
isnt
the
artificial
aroma
in
lots
of
other
beverages
its
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
some
sediment
the
taste
is
mostly
apple
with
some
citrus
and
floral
its
not
overly
sweet
so
it
doesnt
come
off
as
overbearing
like
many
other
fruit
beers
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
and
has
the
body
of
a
light
belgian
i
really
like
this
one
unibroue
seems
to
consistently
produce
highquality
brews
so
ill
definitely
try
more
from
them
probably
would
not
have
tried
this
beer
unless
someone
brought
it
over
to
my
house
i
am
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
as
it
is
a
unique
and
well
made
beverage
saying
that
i
probably
wont
ever
buy
it
maybe
i
just
didnt
connect
with
it
i
like
the
label
a
bit
feminine
for
beer
but
i
suppose
there
should
be
beer
for
ladies
too
the
head
was
a
fizzy
white
the
aroma
was
filled
with
apples
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
a
little
fizzy
a
little
silky
the
flavor
was
complex
with
hints
of
apple
pear
lemon
concord
grape
some
bitterness
in
the
back
end
the
finish
lingers
for
just
a
few
moments
of
apple
flavor
it
is
a
nice
summer
beer
that
maybe
i
would
get
for
the
wife
even
though
her
impression
was
similar
to
mine
good
but
not
remarkable
overall
subjectively
i
have
to
say
that
im
slightly
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
with
more
tart
and
sour
rather
than
a
watered
down
apple
juice
objectively
the
beer
is
decent
enough
to
drink
the
whole
way
through
and
the
abv
is
low
enough
say
that
you
dont
feel
like
an
alcoholic
if
you
drink
it
during
the
day
i
wouldnt
put
this
on
my
top
list
of
recommendations
but
its
good
enough
to
have
cool
during
a
hot
summerspring
day
d
refreshing
and
not
overly
sweet
d
this
goes
down
very
easily
the
sweetness
is
the
only
drawback
i
can
see
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
lot
of
apple
flavor
it
stands
true
to
a
white
ale
with
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
i
would
drink
this
with
desert
preferably
an
apple
pie
cheers
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
i
liked
it
probably
more
than
i
should
its
a
drinkable
beer
with
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
and
a
nice
departure
from
other
styles
when
needed
an
easy
beer
to
drink
even
its
boldest
traits
dont
offend
has
some
good
unique
qualities
mouthfeel
drinkability
perhaps
slightly
too
carbonated
the
carbonation
takes
away
from
the
apple
and
cider
flavors
slightly
sour
and
bitter
light
bodied
and
funky
d
very
very
drinkable
crisp
apples
and
heavy
pie
textures
from
cinnamon
coriander
and
other
spices
balance
the
crispness
well
cloudy
goldenstraw
in
color
with
everlasting
white
bubbly
head
that
leaves
pretty
lacing
weak
aroma
of
sugars
apples
juice
light
fruit
and
sour
notes
a
wave
of
flavors
hits
the
palate
sour
apples
light
fruit
apple
skins
slight
lemon
and
fruit
skins
in
the
aftertaste
light
in
body
with
spritzy
carbonation
that
tickles
the
palate
a
very
refreshing
fruity
but
not
annoyingly
so
beer
that
satisfies
that
light
sweet
beer
crave
t
again
a
bit
of
a
stale
granny
smith
apple
flavor
with
a
little
pepper
and
spice
to
it
not
much
to
this
one
and
without
a
doubt
the
worst
unibroue
beer
ive
ever
had
head
of
one
finger
dense
foam
with
little
lace
color
is
a
6
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
slightly
foggy
smell
apples
of
course
with
some
trace
of
honey
and
malt
taste
is
green
apple
spices
wheat
malt
and
a
slight
trace
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
on
the
bland
side
with
a
little
tingle
form
the
carbonation
a
change
of
pace
but
just
too
sweet
for
any
extended
drinking
i
would
try
it
again
while
this
wasnt
horrible
as
i
feared
it
still
wasnt
good
despite
my
reluctance
i
have
had
a
few
decent
and
even
good
fruit
beers
unfortunately
this
wasnt
one
of
them
although
i
suspect
age
may
have
been
the
greatest
factor
in
its
lack
of
balance
d
if
the
appleness
of
this
beer
sits
well
with
you
you
could
hit
a
lot
of
these
in
a
night
but
beware
the
bubbles
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
not
in
a
good
way
more
like
a
light
beer
clean
light
flavors
of
apple
and
spices
are
prominant
with
a
clean
dryish
finish
not
much
depth
not
a
must
have
just
ok
d
this
is
a
beer
for
the
right
occasion
possibly
as
a
dessert
could
be
a
good
gateway
for
the
friends
of
ours
that
dont
like
beer
d
this
was
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
it
was
a
very
nice
belgian
ale
that
would
be
perfect
to
drink
in
the
summer
with
a
superb
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
and
tart
flavors
im
not
big
into
fruit
beers
but
this
was
very
enjoyable
recommended
and
as
i
consider
this
more
of
a
sipping
cider
for
a
summer
night
and
not
a
cider
to
be
compared
with
its
more
robust
winter
brethren
i
think
it
begins
to
do
more
of
what
it
sets
out
to
do
it
doesnt
seek
to
be
heavy
or
especially
overpowering
and
i
appreciate
that
does
it
make
up
for
whats
sometimes
a
rather
thin
taste
overall
not
always
but
this
is
one
that
i
can
very
reasonablybuy
and
share
during
a
time
of
year
that
is
peppered
thin
with
ciders
i
think
it
adds
a
lot
to
a
repetioire
of
sometimes
heavier
offerings
from
unibroue
and
never
find
myself
regretting
buying
or
sharing
it
d
to
juice
like
for
me
just
plain
to
sweet
and
bland
really
think
this
is
one
of
the
lesser
unibroue
beers
ok
first
off
let
me
say
that
i
love
almost
any
kind
of
beer
i
even
like
wild
blue
even
though
that
tastes
like
grape
soda
instead
of
beer
but
this
this
is
not
beer
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
cider
it
tastes
a
little
like
sparkling
white
grape
juice
and
apple
juice
mixed
together
with
even
less
of
a
cheap
pilsner
i
drank
it
and
cant
believe
that
i
did
so
i
gave
it
at
least
a
2
for
drinkability
but
it
tasted
awful
at
first
for
a
summer
drink
on
a
hot
day
this
might
be
nice
and
refreshing
however
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
other
things
i
could
drink
instead
in
that
instance
as
it
is
theres
not
much
going
for
it
o
once
i
adjusted
to
the
strong
apple
flavor
i
started
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
fruity
as
a
cider
but
with
a
quite
different
flavor
profile
notes
im
not
sure
if
theres
really
wheat
in
it
or
if
the
coriander
just
makes
me
think
of
a
witbeer
regardless
its
probably
unibroues
least
impressive
beer
but
thats
not
saying
much
its
a
tasty
and
somewhat
subtle
fruit
beer
ephemeres
something
both
a
beer
geek
and
his
nonbeerdrinking
girlfriend
can
enjoy
d
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
but
theres
not
much
complexity
at
all
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
beer
but
the
apple
taste
is
way
to
strong
and
sweet
for
my
liking
drinkability
for
a
fruit
beer
it
was
really
nice
and
easy
drinking
edit
the
bottled
version
isnt
even
close
to
the
draft
version
grabbed
some
as
a
followup
and
theyre
okay
but
much
milder
to
the
point
of
being
boring
fyi
id
give
it
a
3
3
or
so
not
flawed
but
zzzzzzzz
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
had
expected
given
the
reviews
its
certainly
not
my
new
goto
beer
but
the
brewery
seems
to
have
achieved
what
it
set
out
to
make
a
green
apple
beer
that
is
edit
turns
out
i
couldnt
even
finish
this
one
the
artificial
tart
apple
flavor
eventually
overwhelmed
me
and
it
ended
up
being
a
drain
pour
lowering
drinkability
score
as
a
result
d
very
easy
to
drink
fruity
and
fizzy
slightly
overcarbonated
basically
an
appleinfused
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
soft
champagnelike
finish
some
may
not
care
for
it
but
i
enjoyed
the
light
sweet
fruity
quality
of
the
beer
d
very
high
it
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easily
good
beer
for
a
summer
day
m
light
body
smooth
moderate
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
shitload
of
this
this
is
the
perfect
brunch
beer
or
would
work
as
a
supplement
to
sparkling
cider
very
tasty
overall
this
is
a
decent
fruit
flavored
beer
the
dryness
and
watery
body
hurts
the
drinkability
but
interesting
nonetheless
and
worth
checking
out
actually
a
quite
interesting
beer
from
unibroue
it
is
a
light
cloudy
gold
with
a
rocky
1
inch
head
smell
is
a
wave
of
apple
and
orange
peel
with
a
faint
yeast
scent
on
the
background
taste
is
of
very
crisp
refreshing
apple
with
a
delicious
belgian
yeast
biscuity
flavor
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
that
of
a
saison
very
high
carbonation
and
bite
drinkability
is
lower
than
some
beers
due
to
its
sweetness
not
bad
though
i
love
several
of
the
other
unibroue
offerings
and
thats
partly
why
in
comparison
i
was
so
disappointed
with
this
one
poured
about
a
12
head
which
totally
dissipated
amber
definite
smell
of
apples
and
a
taste
subtley
apple
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
cheat
though
because
they
had
to
add
the
apple
juice
to
the
product
to
get
the
apple
flavoring
it
isnt
simply
from
brewing
with
apples
drinkability
very
drinkable
might
be
a
little
light
to
have
with
a
meal
possibly
better
for
a
dessert
beer
d
very
smooth
it
went
down
very
easily
i
dont
know
if
i
could
handle
drinking
another
immediately
but
im
not
going
to
count
that
as
a
knock
since
the
flavor
is
so
strong
d
well
it
was
cool
to
get
this
so
cheap
and
i
have
had
it
with
a
year
or
more
on
it
and
it
seems
the
green
apple
flavor
shines
with
age
still
fresh
it
is
rather
tasty
one
is
good
for
a
sitting
d
flavors
not
bad
and
i
guess
this
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
but
im
not
loving
it
refreshing
enough
but
its
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
too
uncomfortable
for
me
to
want
this
very
often
mouthfeel
was
good
fairly
light
but
because
of
the
complexity
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
750ml
corked
and
caged
shared
with
a
friend
in
10oz
snifters
while
watching
scott
pilgrim
vs
the
world
poured
softly
for
a
2finger
head
with
wonderful
retention
very
cloudy
gold
lacing
was
sticky
covering
20
of
the
glass
aroma
consisted
of
belgian
yeast
with
slight
sour
apple
orange
peel
and
some
lemon
taste
had
a
dry
feel
and
had
a
slight
sourness
like
that
of
eating
gummi
worms
extremely
dry
feeling
on
the
mouth
and
a
touch
of
candy
apple
lambiclike
carbonation
slight
sour
apple
stays
on
the
palate
from
tastetotaste
like
a
halfsour
belgian
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
drinkabilty
well
nothing
special
here
kind
of
a
step
up
from
blue
moon
its
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
light
in
alcohol
this
could
be
better
more
spices
and
less
sour
apple
but
it
is
a
decent
enough
to
drink
its
very
light
could
drink
34
of
these
ona
hot
summer
day
for
sure
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
moderate
carbonation
but
it
is
a
light
body
and
light
colour
big
on
the
smells
but
a
restrained
but
wellcrafted
taste
palette
unlike
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
this
one
actually
tastes
like
beer
while
mretainig
a
strong
fruit
aftertaste
4
0
d
not
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
the
base
beer
is
pretty
good
and
enough
fruit
is
used
to
not
feel
watered
down
would
drink
again
d
without
wanting
to
be
sexist
this
beer
is
targeted
at
females
it
offers
very
little
in
complexity
the
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
tart
apples
with
a
little
bit
of
bready
and
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
once
again
heavy
on
the
granny
smith
apples
there
is
a
little
bit
of
malt
but
it
is
well
hidden
behind
the
fruit
there
is
a
light
tartness
to
the
beer
high
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
enormous
white
head
this
beer
is
pale
yellow
in
color
and
looked
like
an
adjunct
until
i
dumped
some
yeast
into
the
glass
i
could
smell
the
green
apple
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
i
got
an
even
bigger
whiff
once
i
started
pouring
the
apple
obviously
dominates
the
aroma
i
think
i
get
some
malt
in
there
too
the
taste
is
big
on
apple
as
well
the
finish
has
some
spiciness
to
it
it
tastes
like
some
belgian
yeast
it
finishes
like
a
wit
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
i
expected
it
to
be
sweeter
since
i
know
a
couple
of
women
who
like
it
a
lot
it
reminds
me
of
a
mix
of
hard
cider
and
witbier
it
was
worth
a
try
but
this
one
makes
a
good
product
halfway
between
cider
and
beer
drinkability
i
expect
an
apple
beer
to
have
a
stronger
apple
presences
this
beer
did
not
bring
the
full
apple
crunch
to
the
table
i
did
not
mind
this
beer
but
not
something
i
am
looking
for
down
the
road
taste
is
coriander
and
green
apples
up
front
a
bit
sweet
and
light
then
a
drier
fruityyeasty
grain
finish
with
lightly
sweet
graincitrusfruit
aftertaste
following
feel
is
fairly
lively
the
drinkability
is
just
fine
its
simple
if
you
like
beer
and
apples
youll
enjoy
it
if
you
like
beer
and
dont
like
apples
then
you
may
want
to
skip
it
if
you
dont
like
beer
but
like
apples
this
could
the
beer
for
you
but
if
you
dont
like
beer
or
apples
then
go
eat
a
pear
ya
fruit
overall
decent
beer
overall
theres
not
a
ton
going
on
here
but
the
flavor
is
good
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
wont
necessarily
recommend
this
beer
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
unibroue
it
may
be
worth
checking
out
d
easy
to
drink
and
light
sadly
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
much
at
all
and
i
highly
doubt
purchasing
it
again
due
in
large
part
to
its
lack
of
character
not
bad
but
nothing
too
impressive
d
easily
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
for
anyone
who
is
not
much
of
a
beer
drinker
to
those
who
like
a
mild
clean
very
flavorful
beer
ill
be
back
for
more
d
very
drinkable
would
like
another
so
i
shall
perhaps
not
even
share
this
bottle
with
anyone
but
me
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
its
a
great
example
of
some
of
the
more
outthere
things
that
can
be
done
with
beer
a
great
beer
to
give
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
note
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
this
but
has
some
ok
qualities
but
for
as
crisp
as
it
is
its
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
im
still
fairly
new
to
fruit
beers
so
this
may
be
a
shining
example
but
if
so
then
i
should
stay
away
highly
drinkable
due
to
the
nice
taste
and
the
light
bodied
crispness
not
to
mention
the
modest
abv
of
5
5
pours
a
light
honey
with
a
medium
creamy
white
head
really
soft
look
tiny
bubbles
abound
good
lacing
aroma
boasts
granny
smith
apple
caramel
light
hops
kind
of
thin
feeling
with
nice
green
apple
tones
but
with
cardboard
on
the
finish
that
drags
out
a
bit
long
refreshing
and
decent
flavor
needs
to
be
more
soft
and
of
course
that
classic
cardboard
quality
i
could
do
without
dthis
beer
is
singular
and
messy
the
malt
presence
seems
out
of
whack
and
the
green
apple
flavors
are
not
inviting
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
above
average
drinkability
is
decent
it
had
some
cool
and
interesting
flavors
to
it
and
the
crispness
of
the
apple
made
it
pretty
refreshing
it
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
maybe
a
bit
light
on
beer
flavors
overall
though
for
me
it
felt
more
like
a
cider
or
apple
juice
then
a
beer
at
times
not
that
those
things
arent
delicious
though
d
while
the
abv
would
let
you
drink
it
for
a
long
time
the
taste
would
become
too
much
i
tired
of
this
beer
quickly
not
particularly
drinkable
i
would
not
have
this
one
again
this
was
fun
to
drink
and
id
enjoy
another
without
hesitation
fruit
beers
are
really
hit
or
miss
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
is
a
good
one
because
the
fruit
taste
is
very
natural
tasting
and
not
over
the
top
often
fruit
in
beers
tastes
very
artificial
but
not
here
recommended
this
is
a
fine
summer
beer
perfect
for
those
occasions
where
your
beer
tastes
are
straying
toward
the
fruity
side
of
things
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
this
is
one
of
the
few
i
would
recommend
a
pretty
good
but
not
great
applebeer
apples
not
my
favorite
fruit
to
work
into
a
beer
but
they
did
a
decent
job
appearance
is
hazy
orangeyellow
not
much
carbonation
14
inch
head
disappears
after
about
a
minute
smell
is
nice
apples
predominate
taste
is
apple
smooth
malts
some
zest
from
the
coriander
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
its
a
crisp
beer
good
for
a
summer
day
goes
down
quite
easily
but
i
suppose
the
apple
flavoring
might
get
old
after
a
while
pale
gold
colored
brew
pretty
hazy
and
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
to
form
a
puffy
white
head
scent
is
mostly
granny
smith
apples
along
with
some
light
malts
the
taste
is
pretty
complex
and
i
cant
think
of
anything
ive
had
like
it
its
got
a
wheat
beer
base
with
a
light
amount
of
tart
apple
flavoring
along
with
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
a
yeast
profile
and
yet
despite
the
layers
its
all
pretty
mellow
kind
of
biting
on
the
tongue
thin
to
medium
bodied
certainly
a
unique
brew
i
thought
it
sounded
interesting
so
i
bought
a
750ml
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
it
poured
light
and
crisp
and
was
an
applesauce
in
color
with
a
light
white
head
that
laced
the
rim
of
the
glass
it
continued
to
bubble
kind
of
like
sprite
the
aromas
given
off
were
interesting
at
first
it
was
of
sweet
apple
and
had
kind
of
a
pilsner
tint
to
it
as
the
beer
went
on
it
smelled
more
like
a
granny
smith
or
a
cider
and
the
coriander
became
more
apparent
the
taste
too
began
sweet
before
tasting
a
bit
sour
and
like
a
granny
smith
cider
it
tasted
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
crisp
the
beer
was
very
very
carbonated
and
continued
to
be
so
it
didnt
really
dry
out
like
i
thought
it
would
i
think
that
for
a
single
beer
its
very
drinkable
its
essentially
a
cider
so
id
say
its
better
suited
for
a
hot
day
it
was
definitely
interesting
its
probably
worth
a
try
although
nothing
too
special
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
light
also
this
beer
surprised
me
the
flavors
to
me
were
on
the
mild
side
but
the
beer
was
balanced
fairly
well
if
i
would
have
had
a
stronger
apple
and
malt
flavor
that
gave
more
presents
on
palate
i
would
have
given
it
a
better
score
drinks
very
well
quite
obviously
this
beers
best
quality
refreshing
summertime
brew
that
doesnt
quite
pass
into
the
too
fruity
realm
but
has
plenty
of
fruitiness
nonetheless
with
the
right
food
or
cheese
this
might
pair
relatively
well
but
i
would
avoid
this
on
its
own
a
low
point
for
the
brewery
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
though
i
really
wouldnt
care
for
another
this
really
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
fake
green
apple
flavor
tastes
just
like
it
smells
yeast
green
apples
and
a
little
bit
of
cornbread
the
body
was
light
but
held
together
with
abundant
carbonation
that
had
a
lingering
bite
it
was
an
apple
beer
for
sure
an
a
nonoffensive
one
at
that
but
ones
enough
pours
a
golden
orange
color
into
an
allagash
flute
smell
has
apple
corriander
and
orange
and
not
too
much
else
perhaps
some
yeasty
notes
as
well
the
wheatiness
sticks
out
in
the
original
sip
bt
the
applr
becomes
more
and
more
apparent
as
it
is
drank
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
wateriness
to
it
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
and
plan
on
using
it
as
a
segway
for
some
into
craft
beer
this
beer
poured
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
stayed
throughout
the
beer
it
smelt
very
much
like
apples
and
like
a
sparkling
wine
it
tasted
like
a
sparkiling
wine
very
strong
apple
flavors
with
just
a
bit
of
a
beer
like
taste
very
sweet
and
very
light
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
overall
very
interesting
and
not
bad
if
you
like
the
apple
taste
drink
once
again
another
beer
that
i
appreciate
for
its
distinctiveness
but
not
my
sort
of
thing
i
cant
see
myself
wanting
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
the
back
of
the
bottle
mentions
how
it
goes
perfectly
with
certain
foods
like
cheese
and
pork
i
wouldnt
mind
testing
out
that
theory
d
very
easy
drinker
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
it
is
a
little
cider
like
with
the
amount
of
apple
you
get
this
may
not
be
everybodys
kind
of
brew
but
i
like
the
difference
of
these
kinds
of
brew
my
first
apple
brew
and
i
like
this
one
it
is
a
unibroue
and
you
really
cannot
go
wrong
with
these
guys
d
would
not
ever
have
another
unless
i
was
offered
it
by
a
friend
d
this
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
am
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
person
but
i
will
get
this
again
when
i
am
in
the
mode
for
a
fruit
beer
drinkability
sure
thing
d
very
easy
to
drink
like
carbonated
juice
in
retrospect
missing
many
beer
qualities
but
i
really
liked
it
a
great
palate
cleaner
and
a
very
gentle
apple
quality
its
completely
a
crisp
beer
that
doesnt
have
an
lingering
quality
of
misplace
ingredients
the
citrus
quality
was
well
blended
between
the
apple
sour
there
is
some
floral
quality
even
this
is
was
a
clean
cut
beer
that
doesnt
have
much
to
offer
but
doesnt
really
fail
along
the
way
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
drinkability
the
apple
flavor
is
strong
but
offset
by
the
intense
carbonation
if
the
carbonation
was
lessened
this
would
improve
the
beer
dramatically
had
my
first
one
of
these
five
years
ago
and
thought
it
was
too
much
like
a
green
apple
soda
this
next
meeting
with
ephemere
was
better
offering
a
few
more
dimensions
than
just
sweet
bubbly
apple
beer
still
not
my
favorite
and
not
one
id
go
to
often
but
its
solid
and
so
damn
refreshing
that
its
drinkability
is
almost
off
the
chart
dextremely
high
i
could
easily
sit
and
drink
the
whole
4
pack
in
under
an
hour
and
will
drink
it
all
tonight
not
a
very
high
abv
great
warm
weather
beer
absolutely
one
of
my
top
summer
brews
drink
it
on
the
hottest
day
of
the
year
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
aromas
are
wonderfully
refreshing
the
watery
mouthfeel
is
actually
appropriate
to
style
due
to
fruits
that
tend
to
thin
out
fermentables
bjcp
a
well
made
fruit
beer
this
beer
is
surprisingly
good
for
a
fruit
beer
d
highly
drinkable
mainly
because
the
flavor
and
feel
is
not
very
complex
i
personally
like
the
taste
of
apples
but
some
people
might
get
sick
of
it
ephemere
apple
is
pretty
good
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
well
made
and
focused
pours
a
golden
straw
hue
with
rich
slightly
sweet
yeasty
smell
with
overtones
of
sour
apple
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
mild
belgian
white
ale
subtle
complex
yeast
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
very
mild
sour
bite
with
just
a
hint
of
apple
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
was
a
bit
sad
id
bought
only
one
d
went
down
easy
enough
and
i
could
see
subsituting
this
for
a
hard
cider
if
you
are
looking
for
more
of
a
fruity
crispness
to
go
with
a
meal
pours
a
hazy
yellow
gold
color
with
a
thick
three
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
a
skim
with
little
to
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
good
nice
green
apple
smell
with
corriander
and
some
other
fruits
present
the
aroma
is
strong
and
very
inviting
the
taste
fell
a
little
bit
short
there
wasnt
much
there
a
wheat
backbone
with
hints
of
apple
and
corriander
but
after
the
smell
i
expect
a
more
full
flavorful
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
okay
there
is
nothing
to
really
dislike
but
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
crave
more
either
it
needs
a
stronger
flavor
d
not
one
i
would
drink
again
i
was
disappointed
as
so
far
unibroue
has
been
in
my
top
spots
for
their
other
beers
i
appreciate
all
beers
within
context
i
had
this
beer
tonight
with
a
plate
of
pan
fried
appleonion
pork
sausage
fantastic
this
is
also
a
great
beer
to
sip
while
resting
in
the
shade
on
a
hot
summer
morning
if
i
was
going
to
drink
an
alcoholic
apple
beverage
id
go
with
one
of
the
many
quality
ciders
available
in
my
area
so
i
doubt
id
get
this
again
however
this
rating
is
for
drinkability
and
this
one
went
down
easily
with
a
5
5
abv
you
could
drink
these
oneforone
with
most
hard
ciders
and
have
the
satisfaction
that
youre
drinking
a
beer
taste
is
bold
sweettart
apple
flavor
general
fruitiness
i
struggle
to
identify
mild
spiciness
and
is
quite
thin
and
finishes
dry
with
a
cidery
acidity
but
a
sugary
sticky
flavor
still
manages
to
stick
around
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carb
a
bit
distractingly
spritzy
even
masking
the
flavor
a
bit
the
beer
wasnt
bad
but
ive
little
desire
to
crack
open
another
the
high
carbonation
fits
this
type
of
beer
and
it
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
unoffensive
easy
drinking
approachable
fruit
beer
but
not
by
any
means
spectacular
d
im
a
big
fan
of
unibroues
beers
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
ive
had
so
far
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
sweet
apples
and
mint
combination
it
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
wouldnt
try
again
d
not
bad
but
a
little
fizzy
and
the
sweetness
gets
old
much
like
carbonated
apple
juice
refreshing
and
dry
might
be
good
for
a
hot
day
kef
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
especially
in
the
warm
summer
months
really
easy
to
drink
this
could
be
a
good
candidate
to
bring
to
a
dinner
party
where
there
arent
a
lot
of
beer
drinkers
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
are
slightly
better
than
average
smooth
and
easy
going
but
nothing
has
me
running
to
buy
a
case
d
it
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
to
be
sure
but
other
than
the
uncommon
semitart
apple
flavor
theres
nothing
special
about
it
i
have
friends
who
dont
like
beer
that
might
even
find
this
agreeable
notes
nice
light
offering
from
unibroue
nothing
to
rave
about
but
an
enticing
social
quaffer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
and
considerable
sediment
floating
around
smell
is
very
sweet
strong
apple
aroma
taste
is
milder
than
the
smell
green
apples
with
some
spice
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
too
much
apple
too
sweet
i
wasnt
really
blown
away
or
impressed
by
this
beer
especially
for
the
price
tag
it
wasnt
exactly
unpleasant
either
the
high
carbonation
is
the
only
real
fault
i
could
find
otherwise
a
charming
tarty
fruit
beer
md
the
carbonation
combined
with
flavor
made
this
an
undrinkable
brew
light
feel
but
the
apple
becomes
sour
in
the
end
thus
taking
away
the
crispness
feel
ok
drinking
may
try
it
again
later
d
this
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
wish
there
was
more
apple
and
sourness
but
overall
it
is
pretty
decent
d
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
brew
but
there
isnt
really
anything
extrodinary
or
exciting
either
it
is
refreshing
after
long
day
of
work
and
a
seemingly
longer
commute
though
it
should
go
without
saying
that
youre
only
likely
to
enjoy
this
beer
to
the
same
extent
you
like
tart
green
apples
or
at
very
least
to
the
extent
youre
in
the
mood
for
tart
green
apples
those
who
dont
share
that
taste
will
certainly
be
overwhelmed
comparing
fruit
beers
to
more
general
styles
can
be
like
well
comparing
apples
and
oranges
theres
so
many
sugary
artificial
ones
out
there
fortunately
this
is
not
one
of
them
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
adequately
spritzy
this
beer
delivered
what
i
expected
d
good
almost
like
beer
and
cider
had
a
kid
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
yeasty
sour
candied
apples
spices
citrus
and
caramel
taste
is
a
lot
like
it
smells
with
yeasty
sour
apples
spices
and
citrus
light
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
overall
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
this
beer
is
just
ok
imo
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
version
of
delirium
tremens
it
would
be
pleasant
on
a
warm
day
or
with
some
mild
fish
this
is
ok
but
id
rather
not
be
reminded
of
old
ladies
bath
products
when
i
drink
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
drinkability
is
on
the
higher
side
but
the
taste
is
too
one
dimensional
to
me
d
not
really
meant
to
be
a
session
type
beer
but
goes
really
well
with
certain
types
of
foods
the
apple
flavor
would
complement
a
chicken
or
turkey
dinner
well
or
perhaps
go
well
with
some
smoked
or
sharp
cheese
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
plenty
of
quickly
disappearing
head
lots
of
fresh
cut
apples
after
popping
the
cap
apples
and
vinegar
are
ripe
in
the
nose
a
bitter
sweet
taste
awaits
the
first
sip
lots
of
yeast
available
in
the
taste
i
could
sip
this
easily
i
am
glad
i
got
the
unibrue
variety
pack
nice
offering
from
unibroue
the
creaminess
and
some
of
the
apple
stays
with
you
a
while
after
not
exactly
pleasant
overall
i
dont
find
it
that
drinkable
but
i
will
finish
the
bottle
taste
however
correlates
poorly
not
a
bad
thing
though
it
would
seemingly
be
sweeter
but
it
was
rather
dry
witlike
citrusy
and
grainy
at
a
time
grassy
even
much
of
the
coriander
popping
up
here
discrete
bitter
finish
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
which
is
the
weak
flank
it
has
but
in
all
this
is
a
fab
beer
for
shame
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
large
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
away
and
leaves
no
lacing
sweet
and
sour
aroma
of
green
apples
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
similiar
to
the
aroma
light
body
with
high
carbonation
fairly
dry
this
is
drinkable
and
would
make
a
refreshing
summer
drink
although
if
i
had
a
craving
for
apple
id
probably
choose
a
cider
over
this
d
somewhat
refreshing
but
nothing
there
to
say
this
is
beer
its
more
like
an
appleflavored
soda
ephemereale
brewed
with
apple
juice
coriander
and
curacao
served
out
of
a
bottle
it
poured
a
foggy
golden
yellow
it
smelled
of
caramel
green
apples
vanilla
and
coriander
it
tasted
of
a
light
crisp
sour
apple
yeast
milky
with
a
light
lingering
spiciness
on
the
tongue
the
flavors
seemed
too
fake
tasting
though
for
my
own
taste
it
tasted
a
bit
too
much
like
a
green
apple
jolly
rancher
it
was
reminiscent
of
a
wine
cooler
with
a
beer
twist
do
they
even
make
beer
coolers
this
would
be
a
good
example
definitely
not
my
taste
and
i
wont
be
drinking
this
one
again
d
i
can
see
this
as
an
enjoyable
choice
for
a
springsummer
night
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
often
poured
a
cloudyhazy
yellow
into
a
glass
with
a
frothy
white
head
smell
was
faint
but
of
spicy
and
sour
apples
taste
was
similar
earthy
and
floral
up
front
balanced
by
some
apple
sweetness
and
spice
decent
fruit
beer
not
overpowering
by
any
stretch
well
balanced
just
nothing
too
special
about
it
bottle
samplesnice
beer
for
the
summer
foggy
straw
body
with
a
small
whitish
head
aromas
are
citrus
apples
and
a
sugary
candy
aroma
tastes
like
sweet
and
sourtart
apples
slight
alcohol
taste
is
present
as
well
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
for
sure
drinkability
is
good
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
then
one
in
a
session
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
small
but
rich
white
head
the
aromas
are
massive
granny
smith
apples
practically
assault
the
nostrils
green
apple
carries
over
strongly
on
the
palate
with
yeast
also
featuring
prominently
the
taste
is
takes
the
label
a
bit
too
literally
for
my
taste
its
unique
and
interesting
for
sure
but
i
dont
honestly
enjoy
the
taste
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
meh
i
cant
imagine
an
apple
beer
could
be
much
better
than
this
that
said
i
can
think
of
a
handful
of
fruits
better
suited
to
brewing
and
particularly
to
this
beer
surprisingly
it
ends
up
being
a
bit
heavy
and
filing
in
the
end
perhaps
that
sediment
is
taking
away
more
from
the
beer
than
i
thought
anyway
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
quite
unique
well
done
overall
this
is
a
nice
clean
crisp
brew
the
highlight
of
this
is
the
green
apple
notes
definitely
too
watery
but
it
is
meant
to
be
light
the
curacao
could
play
a
much
more
prominent
role
here
too
and
it
would
add
much
needed
complexity
overall
i
found
it
an
enjoyable
beer
i
found
it
to
be
more
of
a
tart
fruit
flavor
than
outright
sweet
which
was
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
again
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
would
be
on
my
short
list
if
im
in
the
fruit
mood
as
advertied
this
is
a
nice
crisp
summer
refresher
like
i
said
it
seems
to
be
more
of
an
traditional
european
soda
carbonation
and
all
which
is
good
but
i
suppose
this
is
what
a
fruitvegetable
beer
is
all
about
just
not
really
my
thing
if
i
am
looking
for
beer
light
on
the
mouth
this
should
be
served
very
cold
a
good
beer
for
the
spring
the
smell
was
dominated
by
apples
of
course
with
faint
spiciness
in
the
back
it
was
thin
in
the
mouth
and
light
malt
taste
that
was
a
cross
between
a
light
beer
and
apple
cider
overall
my
wife
was
a
fan
of
this
but
it
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
this
is
good
to
try
once
but
nothing
i
would
have
again
came
off
as
sparkling
winecooler
and
not
much
a
beer
this
beer
could
have
scratched
a
fantastic
itch
a
nice
cheap
alternative
to
those
wonderful
fruity
lambics
and
geuzes
but
its
not
even
close
will
not
buy
again

i
finished
the
4pack
but
it
wont
be
a
repeat
for
me
if
i
want
a
witbier
ill
buy
ommegang
witte
instead
pretty
good
for
a
fruit
beer
drinkability
this
would
be
a
perfect
summertime
refresher
just
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
with
a
mild
crisp
fruity
flavor
but
not
so
complex
as
to
distract
from
a
summer
open
house
with
friends
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
ive
enjoyed
all
the
other
offerings
ive
had
from
unibroue
big
fan
of
la
terrible
trois
pistoles
is
next
hopefully
it
will
be
a
better
experience
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
finishes
without
much
aftertaste
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
goes
down
really
easy
too
with
the
lower
alcohol
level
this
is
good
for
what
it
is
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
brews
that
being
said
it
would
be
awesome
to
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
as
opposed
to
iced
tea
or
lemonade
good
for
what
it
is
just
not
my
particular
type
of
brew
d
the
flavor
may
get
a
bit
old
after
a
few
but
its
certainly
delicious
for
what
it
is
i
could
have
at
least
two
and
be
refreshed
and
satisfied
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
glass
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
a
pale
hazy
yellow
in
color
with
a
big
fizzy
white
head
no
lace
the
smell
and
the
flavor
of
this
is
all
about
tart
apples
to
be
honest
that
is
all
i
smell
and
it
is
the
dominant
flavor
along
with
some
spice
the
finish
is
sweet
and
lingering
the
beer
is
light
and
fizzy
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
even
though
i
do
not
see
myself
buying
it
again
if
i
want
apples
i
will
reach
for
cider
not
beer
it
was
good
not
great
not
special
overall
it
was
fairly
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
given
that
there
is
secondary
fermentation
involved
i
am
somewhat
interested
in
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
try
it
both
fresher
my
bottle
was
sitting
around
for
a
few
months
and
aged
a
little
bit
longer
atmosphere
is
okay
appearance
is
pretty
average
nose
is
very
fruity
and
pleasing
flavor
is
not
what
the
nose
projects
and
the
feel
is
a
little
offputting
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
quaff
i
guess
its
okay
just
for
something
different
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
the
taste
keeps
this
from
being
drinkable
in
my
book
sorry
unibroue
but
no
thanks
to
this
one
d
this
beer
didnt
do
a
lot
for
me
pretty
much
a
nice
wit
thats
had
a
dose
of
apple
added
to
it
im
glad
i
had
it
but
doubt
ill
be
back
value
pricey
pours
to
a
light
golden
yellow
aroma
of
sour
apples
fills
the
nose
immediately
followed
by
some
alcoholic
notes
and
a
little
curacao
flavor
has
a
bit
of
a
stale
apple
character
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
like
champagne
rather
bubbly
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
but
overall
decent
drinkability
it
tastes
like
a
fruit
beer
in
this
case
green
apple
slightly
tart
rather
than
sweet
like
apple
cider
a
combination
of
beer
qualities
and
cider
if
you
are
reading
this
review
and
want
to
try
it
please
take
the
3
other
beers
that
i
have
overall
this
is
pretty
awesome
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
though
the
fruit
is
the
main
component
of
flavor
and
aroma
its
not
overly
sweet
or
sour
one
or
two
would
probably
be
enough
cloudy
with
a
great
apple
aroma
about
it
it
quite
simply
is
my
favorite
apple
flavoured
beverage
at
this
point
creamy
head
without
an
overwrought
carbonation
like
most
ciders
the
malt
seems
to
balance
the
apple
beautifully
if
you
like
cider
youll
love
this
beer
very
straight
forward
and
one
dimensional
i
like
apple
but
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
strongbow
cider
with
more
pronounced
apple
now
that
thats
out
of
my
system
lets
get
serious
at
the
coppermine
pub
in
north
arlington
this
poured
a
cloudy
yelloworange
into
a
chimay
chalice
with
two
fingers
of
bright
white
head
the
head
collapsed
rather
quickly
though
and
laced
a
little
on
the
spotty
side
the
smell
gee
let
me
think
apple
yes
green
apple
but
not
limited
to
green
apple
caramel
passion
fruit
oakiness
and
some
smokiness
also
come
to
the
fore
this
aromatic
mix
was
a
little
surprising
so
i
couldnt
wait
to
sip
it
in
tasting
the
apple
and
passion
fruit
hits
you
first
and
then
dissolves
to
a
surprising
midpalate
vanillaoaktartness
and
then
finishes
on
a
sweetsmoky
note
very
surprisingly
complex
for
a
style
of
beer
which
is
typically
onedimensional
the
feel
was
very
carbonatedspritzy
but
fairly
thin
in
summary
i
couldnt
help
but
think
that
next
summer
i
will
stock
my
fridge
with
plenty
of
this
for
the
long
days
of
working
in
the
yard
also
a
great
beer
to
appeal
to
both
sexes
if
youre
having
a
party
or
dinner
guests
d
cant
do
it
just
cant
drink
this
horrible
brew
the
taste
is
horrendous
it
has
no
flavor
of
apples
or
sweetness
its
flat
and
tastes
like
a
wanna
ba
sparkling
water
the
end
is
fuzzy
and
blah
a
very
poor
effort
all
the
way
around
mouthfeel
poor
and
not
drinkable
at
all
since
i
started
brewing
my
tastes
in
beer
have
changed
considerably
until
today
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
or
any
unibroue
beer
since
i
began
brewing
most
beers
now
leave
me
greatly
disappointed
even
the
ones
i
used
to
love
e
g
bass
pale
ale
this
beer
however
is
still
a
masterpiece
in
my
eyes
i
hope
i
still
feel
the
same
about
the
rest
of
the
unibroue
lineup
this
beer
pours
a
cloudyhazy
honey
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
and
mimimal
lacingit
has
aromas
of
spicy
belgian
yeastapples
and
pearsit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
nice
tastes
of
spicyyeasty
apples
that
really
dominate
this
but
suprisingly
the
apple
plays
the
costar
in
this
brew
with
that
classic
belgian
yeasty
unibroue
taste
being
the
most
prevalent
taste
but
i
also
get
a
little
apple
juice
right
at
the
endnot
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
could
drink
all
night
notes
not
a
very
fruity
beer
this
one
only
had
green
apple
notes
in
the
nose
other
than
that
its
a
pretty
straight
forward
blond
ale
pretty
light
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
seems
a
tad
weak
but
overall
i
felt
the
flavors
were
decent
albeit
the
coriander
was
a
bit
much
not
a
bad
beer
per
say
but
underwhelming
particularly
considering
the
10
for
a
four
pack
price
tag
d
i
really
enjoy
this
fruit
beer
granted
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
the
time
but
i
do
enjoy
trying
to
pair
this
guy
with
food
from
time
to
time
easy
to
drink
a
bottle
especially
with
someone
else
d
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
but
still
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
nevertheless
entirely
drinkable
and
certainly
appropriate
for
the
crisp
fall
weather
not
unibroues
best
but
better
than
most
overall
pretty
much
tastes
like
fizzy
apple
juice
not
very
complex
or
particularly
enjoyable
not
may
favorite
unibroue
offering
d
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
good
taste
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
worth
a
try
sometime
the
body
is
about
what
is
expected
for
a
wit
drinkability
is
excellent
even
better
that
the
base
beer
blance
de
chambly
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
an
excellent
change
of
pace
beer
certainly
worth
trying
the
color
is
golden
brown
and
the
beer
is
very
cloudy
there
is
little
head
that
quickly
dissipates
notes
of
nice
sour
apple
can
be
detected
when
sniffed
sweet
notes
up
front
then
a
nice
green
apple
flavor
followed
by
a
very
sour
note
highly
carbonated
a
very
good
fruit
beer
if
that
is
your
think
although
the
apple
flavor
novelty
could
wear
off
quickly
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
overall
i
feel
as
though
this
is
aggresively
marketed
toward
the
fairer
sex
its
a
decent
beer
but
it
seems
more
like
a
tainted
la
fin
du
monde
than
anything
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
pours
mediumlight
golden
with
a
very
slight
cloudiness
very
slight
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
probably
this
beers
strong
point
apple
tartness
predominates
but
doesnt
overpower
there
are
other
herbal
hints
here
with
a
sort
of
minty
presence
easily
detectable
disappointment
creeps
in
when
it
comes
to
taste
apple
notes
are
extremely
subdued
i
expected
something
much
bolder
there
is
a
continuing
mintherbal
presence
on
the
palate
along
with
the
faintest
maltiness
perhaps
some
sort
of
cinnamoncoriander
character
might
have
been
more
complementary
here
underwhelming
is
probably
the
most
fitting
description
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
smoothness
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
always
expect
a
little
more
from
a
top
notch
operation
such
as
unibroue
drinkability
as
with
many
fruit
beers
its
a
bit
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
drinkbale
ok
but
i
really
have
to
question
if
the
line
between
beer
and
cider
has
been
crossed
here
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
do
enjoy
this
one
the
tastes
are
so
subtle
not
too
sweet
not
too
fruity
but
a
terrific
balance
in
between
i
like
the
the
hint
of
sour
apple
and
the
blend
of
hops
the
aromas
coming
from
this
beer
do
not
hint
at
the
flavor
to
come
nice
body
which
makes
it
quite
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
at
all
d
dare
i
say
it
might
be
a
chick
beer
seems
like
a
beer
you
should
sip
like
a
white
wine
but
you
just
want
to
down
it
to
get
more
effect
dont
drink
and
review
serving
type
bottle
as
someone
who
certainly
enjoys
mixing
it
up
with
a
fruit
beer
now
and
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
find
that
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
unfortunately
taste
like
wine
coolers
and
or
juice
this
beer
certainly
does
not
have
this
problem
it
tastes
like
a
beer
another
highly
palatable
beer
from
a
great
brewery
cheers
unibroue
cheers
a
large
quickly
expanding
almost
pure
white
head
finishes
off
above
the
rim
in
a
flurry
of
tiny
bubbles
which
shine
in
the
light
after
hesitating
for
a
few
seconds
it
fades
calmly
until
only
a
thin
layer
of
froth
is
left
behind
very
little
lacing
is
seen
color
is
a
greenish
orange
kind
of
like
apple
juice
smells
big
on
the
fruits
up
front
with
some
vinegar
in
the
background
apples
apple
rind
coriander
and
a
splash
of
orange
float
to
the
nose
upon
closer
inspection
very
promising
so
far
tastes
involves
more
coriander
green
apples
sweet
apple
juice
and
a
bready
base
light
bodied
and
highly
palatable
but
tasty
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
thats
my
story
and
im
sticking
to
it
mfd
the
body
is
well
carbonated
but
it
is
just
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
tastes
its
a
good
beer
but
not
really
my
thing
maybe
for
the
lady
but
not
enough
apples
for
me
to
want
to
finish
the
bottles
d
pretty
drinkable
for
sure
clean
and
refreshing
it
finishes
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
drinkability
high
level
of
carbonation
reduces
drinkability
but
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
i
think
would
be
quite
drinkable
in
warmer
weather
or
with
hotter
foods
i
like
that
this
is
not
overblown
with
sweetness
it
has
the
fruit
acidity
and
character
but
its
blended
with
a
pleasant
wit
base
leaving
it
clean
and
crisp
not
heavy
or
sickly
this
is
a
fruit
beer
done
pretty
well
the
apples
lend
some
extra
character
to
an
already
decent
beer
but
dont
dominate
the
flavour
i
will
admit
this
one
caught
me
offguard
i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
smell
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
d
at
first
i
thought
the
sweetness
was
going
to
become
a
problem
but
this
actually
was
rather
enjoyable
for
a
fruit
beer
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
md
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
went
into
this
beer
and
it
still
feels
watery
to
me
and
does
not
stimulate
the
tongue
much
its
a
decent
brew
to
drink
but
i
will
not
be
purchasing
again
the
bottle
says
it
is
best
before
2011
maybe
i
should
have
waited
a
little
to
see
what
the
bottle
conditioning
does
i
love
unibroue
but
not
this
beer
for
a
fruity
beer
this
is
actually
quite
impressive
im
not
usually
a
fan
it
still
retains
enough
beer
qualities
to
keep
it
from
being
designated
a
beerlike
cider
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
but
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
fruity
brew
especially
if
you
plug
your
nose
some
fruit
beers
are
one
and
dones
but
this
holds
the
apple
back
and
just
introduces
it
to
you
making
it
a
drinkable
brew
its
clean
and
crisp
and
that
makes
you
want
to
have
more
than
one
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
go
looking
for
it
overall
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
high
could
it
be
any
higher
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
its
nice
on
a
hot
day
but
dont
expect
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
in
flavor
or
smell
very
bubbly
with
lots
of
carbonation
im
not
sure
how
to
classify
this
one
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
if
you
absolutely
have
to
have
a
beer
that
tastes
like
apple
cider
well
they
got
that
dead
on
but
i
cant
remember
when
ive
ever
had
that
type
of
craving
drinkability
the
low
abv
and
wonderfully
powerful
apple
flavors
combined
with
the
mild
yeastiness
and
spiciness
makes
for
a
nice
beer
and
a
pleasant
change
from
a
huge
beer
easily
sessionable
and
i
have
to
admit
i
like
the
mouthfeel
because
it
does
something
a
little
different
than
other
beers
that
simply
dry
or
leave
a
coating
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
wont
ever
buy
this
again
just
fizz
water
that
tastes
like
it
has
green
apple
jolly
ranchers
in
it
its
very
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
its
drinkable
mfd
carbonation
is
spot
on
however
the
totality
of
the
apple
is
a
little
big
had
this
on
tap
in
az
for
3
months
and
it
was
excellent
moved
to
australia
and
my
gf
bought
me
a
6
pack
and
i
could
not
finish
it
too
metalic
and
only
saving
grace
is
the
brewery
and
that
i
have
had
it
on
tap
beforehand
i
loved
the
cassis
while
i
was
at
the
mondial
de
la
biere
in
montreal
we
picked
up
some
local
brews
before
heading
back
to
the
states
and
since
i
am
a
fan
of
nearly
all
of
the
other
unibroue
beers
i
have
had
i
thought
i
would
give
this
a
try
im
not
really
sure
what
to
think
of
this
first
impression
is
that
the
scent
of
apple
is
way
too
overpowering
its
like
they
are
trying
to
hard
to
remind
you
that
they
made
a
beer
with
apples
the
taste
is
also
nothing
impressive
it
tastes
like
they
mixed
bad
cider
with
a
bad
belgian
ale
and
neither
characteristic
is
particularly
pleasing
there
is
almost
no
body
to
this
beer
and
it
drinks
like
a
can
of
flat
soda
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
again
éphémère
was
more
like
fruitflavored
club
soda
than
beer
and
not
something
id
seek
out
again
i
got
a
tulipshaped
glass
of
this
stuff
from
the
bar
down
the
street
that
has
about
36
beers
on
tap
at
all
times
its
quite
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
by
the
time
it
got
to
me
it
only
had
a
thin
head
left
and
was
very
cloudy
and
hazy
very
yellow
it
really
gave
off
some
apple
fumes
apple
was
the
biggest
odor
by
far
maybe
some
earthy
wheat
also
the
flavor
was
overpowered
by
apple
more
the
sour
apple
flavors
associated
with
cider
and
not
the
sweet
types
kind
of
granny
smithy
i
guess
the
other
flavor
was
wheat
beer
spiced
cloves
and
sour
apples
in
a
semithick
brew
its
not
bad
its
just
unusual
and
definitely
a
novelty
easy
going
down
but
not
what
id
like
to
drink
all
night
figured
i
should
try
this
at
some
point
for
the
hell
of
it
pours
deep
honeygolden
lots
of
bubbles
and
carbonation
smells
like
muted
apple
flavoured
graham
crackers
taste
this
to
me
basically
tastes
like
slightly
appleflavored
tonic
water
just
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
lot
of
blandness
extremely
carbonated
super
bubbley
but
no
depth
behind
it
drinkable
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
this
has
to
be
the
most
bland
beer
produced
by
unibroue
the
few
that
will
like
it
will
love
it
but
most
people
expect
better
from
them
d
at
5
5
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
the
most
part
super
light
delicate
and
exceedingly
carbonated
a
cool
beer
to
serve
to
wine
freaks
w
appetizers
if
you
happen
to
be
entertaining
they
wont
believe
its
beer
they
are
drinking
if
you
dont
like
super
dry
beers
or
wines
then
this
probably
wouldnt
be
for
you
pours
a
cloudy
honey
with
a
soft
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
offers
a
very
pleasan
mix
of
spicy
vanilla
and
tart
green
apples
also
a
little
it
of
coconut
in
there
very
enticing
on
the
palate
it
is
slightly
sweet
but
more
tart
and
acidic
from
the
apple
flavours
quite
highly
carbonated
finishes
long
and
dry
not
a
session
beer
but
a
good
beer
for
every
now
and
then
m
d
it
comes
close
to
having
the
sparkling
mouthfeel
that
many
of
unibroues
offerings
have
but
ends
up
being
a
bit
sticky
it
also
seems
somewhat
heavy
for
what
it
is
thats
not
to
say
its
really
weighty
its
just
a
notable
medium
body
when
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
delicate
its
not
the
heaviest
in
alcohol
but
it
seems
this
one
wouldnt
have
been
bad
if
it
were
a
little
lighter
in
flavour
and
alcohol
overall
it
aint
tops
by
any
means
but
damn
i
could
down
em
very
crisp
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
after
cutting
the
lawn
very
refreshing
and
definitely
prefer
to
this
to
an
american
adjunct
in
response
to
a
few
recent
threads
and
forum
posts
tehehe
some
orange
zest
that
im
picking
up
and
a
nice
belgian
yeast
strain
all
culminate
to
produce
a
nice
easy
drink
d
this
goes
down
well
it
is
not
overbearing
and
is
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
unfortunately
it
lacks
depth
and
interest
to
make
this
something
you
want
to
drink
much
of
drinkability
not
good
the
flavours
arent
doing
anything
for
me
and
neither
is
the
mouthfeel
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
by
trade
as
i
think
paying
for
it
would
not
have
been
a
good
thing
d
i
can
imagine
drinking
any
more
than
one
of
these
flavors
are
just
kind
of
odd
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
not
a
lambic
or
fruit
beer
like
i
said
it
was
more
liek
a
wit
with
different
flavors
very
drinkable
drinkability
could
be
drinkable
but
not
something
anyone
will
be
considering
pours
a
very
nice

would
not

again
very

the

is
so
so
golden
color
with
moderate
white
head
definite
apple
notes
in
the
aroma

with

yes
to
me
the
apple
is
of
a
granny
smith
or
maybe
even
a
fuji
smooth
pleasant
beer
and
very
good
on
a
warm
dayevening
body
is
light
along
with
carbonation
a
good
effort
in
this
category
the
apple
is
not
overwhelming
and
to
me
that
is
a
plus
very
underrated
beer
i
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
unibroue
beer
yet
highly
drinkable
great
flavor
and
original
i
can
count
on
one
hand
how
many
fruit
beers
i
have
enjoyed
and
this
one
ranks
with
my
favorites
d
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
encountered
has
a
definate
apple
cider
meets
belgian
brew
characteristic
and
i
was
happy
it
was
an
actual
beer
and
not
fruit
soda
very
unimpressed
i
expected
a
lot
more
taste
and
pungency
in
the
nose
cheers
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
la
fin
du
monde
by
the
same
brewer
this
is
a
very
good
fruit
ale
12
oz
bottle
pours
cloudy
with
tight
carbonation
bubbles
climbing
the
length
of
the
glass
the
tart
green
apple
smell
was
the
best
part
about
this
beer
overall
average
taste
refreshing
but
it
didnt
have
any
flavors
that
stood
out
i
wish
it
had
more
of
a
yeasty
bite
or
some
honeyed
grain
to
compliment
the
apple
aroma
d
sorry
guys
i
have
loved
everything
i
have
ever
tried
from
this
brewery
and
this
one
simply
does
not
stand
up
to
the
rest
of
the
line
up
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
funky
for
me
d
4

excellent
examle
of
a
unique
apple
brew
if
you
are
open
minded
on
fruit
beers
and
like
sour
apple
than
this
brew
is
a
must
try
d
the
high
carbonation
makes
it
more
of
a
summer
brew
but
i
could
see
saving
a
few
for
winter
nights
around
a
warm
fire
drinkable
try
it
and
decide
for
yourself
quite
refreshing
for
a
sunny
brisk
spring
day
it
went
down
quickly
daring
me
to
have
another
the
apple
character
comes
across
as
subtle
and
musty
but
does
well
to
imbue
this
fruit
beer
with
a
particular
elan
d
moderate
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
taste
yet
lightness
would
offer
someone
a
good
sessionable
brew
given
that
they
like
green
apples
enough
the
abundance
of
green
apple
and
slight
lingering
aftertaste
of
bitter
would
limit
the
drinkability
for
me
future
outlook
ive
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
unibroue
and
this
is
no
exception
though
this
one
is
a
bit
more
on
the
outside
of
what
i
typically
want
from
a
beer
d
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
drink
again
i
used
to
hate
fruit
beers
and
this
is
a
prime
example
of
why
vile
swill
d
an
excellent
thirst
quenching
wit
although
fruit
flavors
generally
deter
me
from
drinking
for
than
one
or
two
ive
been
putting
this
one
off
for
awhile
but
im
glad
i
finally
found
a
single
unibroue
kicks
ass
in
all
departments
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
could
share
a
case
of
this
with
the
girls
and
boys
to
make
both
of
them
satisfied
unique
and
complex
drinkability
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
anytimeanywhere
it
would
be
great
with
food
and
even
better
in
the
fall
i
look
forward
to
tasting
this
again

mine
however
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
to
date
anyone
that
is
a
fan
of
the
style
should
enjoy
this
ale
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
thick
head
that
quickly
died
out
smells
like
spiced
apples
and
yeast
initial
flavor
is
very
green
apple
with
a
belgian
coriander
spice
somewhere
in
the
background
there
are
some
other
fruity
flavors
in
there
maybe
strawberry
no
noticeable
hop
or
bitterness
it
was
a
little
bit
watery
feeling
excellent
flavor
drinkability
sweetness
prevents
this
from
being
more
drinkable
but
it
is
still
quite
enjoyable
although
this
is
a
perfect
springsummer
beer
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
i
find
similiar
novelty
type
beers
best
when
enjoyed
singularly
an
alright
brew
m
crisp
bubbly
medium
bodied
i
have
been
sitting
on
this
for
a
nice
spring
day
like
this
nice
choice
d
a
good
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
something
and
doesnt
quite
come
together
for
me
i
think
id
like
more
sour
or
something
else
to
fill
out
the
flavor
this
is
much
less
offensive
than
the
chambly
i
just
drank
taste
is
all
sour
apple
there
is
a
very
large
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
but
it
works
well
with
the
flavors
and
style
not
something
i
could
drink
alot
of
but
different
pours
hazy
light
golden
with
a
tightly
beaded
head
and
some
light
lacing
smells
a
bit
like
a
dusty
apple
jolly
rancher
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
grainy
and
with
some
artificial
sour
apple
flavors
and
a
slightly
washed
out
finish
heavily
carbonated
and
somewhat
creamy
not
for
me
really
overall
it
almost
feels
like
slightly
darker
light
beer
with
apples
and
coriander
its
certainly
not
terrible
but
the
flavors
are
so
unbalanced
it
doesnt
make
for
a
memorable
experience
d
for
a
fruit
beer
its
a
solid
brew
d
this
is
probably
a
onetime
trial
for
most
of
us
seeing
as
it
is
a
fruit
beer
from
a
belgian
brand
i
dig
the
belgian
take
on
a
hard
cider
but
the
odd
mouth
foaming
throws
off
my
drinkability
score
if
it
settles
down
more
by
the
end
of
the
glass
ill
update
my
score
but
i
doubt
that
will
happen
admittancethis
is
not
my
thing
i
loved
apple
jacks
as
a
kid
and
that
was
that
with
not
an
apple
to
speak
of
since
still
pours
a
ncie
golden
body
with
a
thin
yet
consistent
white
head
with
effervescence
showing
this
to
be
a
lively
brew

tart

tart
is
unmistakeable
secondary
flavors
built
off
that
clean
crisp
unfiltered
effervescence
as
a
filler
in
the
case
not
bad
i
must
reiterate
i
mean
no
disrespect
to
the
brewer
and
have
found
more
than
a
few
silly
beers
that
shipped
faux
fruit
along
with
its
malt
and
hops
but
this
is
tastefully
done
gave
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
bottle
said
drink
before

the
brew
poured
to
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
fair
sized
white
bubbly
head
that
broke
down
very
quickly
the
bubbling
action
reminded
me
of
champagne
i
got
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
strong
apple
aroma
my
wife
was
feet
away
of
my
glass
and
she
asked
me
are
you
drinking
a
fruit
beer
there
are
a
few
sour
beers
that
i
like
and
this
one
definitely
is
not

was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
drinkability
quite
a
drinkable
brew
high
on
the
list
of
veggie
beer
ive
tried
for
it
natural
if
a
bit
light
flavor
smells
more
complex
than
it
tastes
though
not
bad
but
weak
i
woulda
like
more
to
it
but
not
bad
overall
an
interesting
beer
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
more
of
an
intriguing
refresher
but
be
warned
by
the
time
i
was
finishing
my
bottle
i
found
it
rather
cloying
and
was
glad
i
was
finished

a
light
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
monstrous
solid
white
head
that
stays
well
the
nose
is
of
tart
green
apples
and
belgianstyle
yeast
not
much
else
but
thats
enough
the
palate
is
maybe
a
little
more
bland
than
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
but
it
is
light
refreshing
and
laced
with
green
apples
and
a
pleasant
sweetness
from
the
malt
some
residual
yeast
notes
here
as
well
as
youd
expect
from

the
body
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
heavyhanded
carbonation

smells
of
green
apple
and
mild
spice
tart
tastes
of
green
apple
lemon
and
spice
a
frothy
medium
body
with
above
average
carbonation
this
is
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
offering
i
would
seek
it
out
again
much
sweeter
than
the
beers
that
unibroue
is
famous
for
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
with
the
apple
flavor
not
quite
as
tart
as
a
new
england
cider
this
one
is
probably
better
cold
recommended
wierd
mouthfeel
at
times
it
seems
too
fizzy
and
at
other
times
it
is
very
smooth
drinkable
but
the
750ml
bottle
can
be
a
challenge
drinkability
good
overall
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
unibroue
knocks
this
one
out
of
the
park
awesome
taste
and
smell
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
forms
a
modest
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
but
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
apples
as
soon
as
i
opened
thed
bottle
i
smelled
apples
this
however
does
not
come
through
as
strongly
when
actually
checking
whats
in
your
glass
tast
was
lacking
what
i
would
have
thought
to
display
more
apple
character
not
my
favorite
unibroue
dont
be
discouraged
by
the
beer
if
your
scoffing
at
its
apple
content
because
its
actually
pretty
damn
good
this
beer
has
piqued
my
long
dead
interest
in
the
style
w00t
unibroue
light
goldenyellow
color
small
white
head
that
is
sustained
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
the
smell
of
apples
hit
me
the
second
i
opened
the
bottle
also
a
hint
of
yeasty
spicyness
the
malts
are
light
tasting
giving
the
impression
of
a
wheat
beer
the
apple
flavors
come
through
but
are
not
overpowering
or
sickly
sweet
as
you
may
expect
i
found
this
to
be
a
rather
nice
little
beer
something
very
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
light
and
easy
on
the
palate
but
with
enough
flavor
to
make
it
interesting
once
again
im
impressed
with
unibroue
a
very
decent
beer
and
something
pleasantly
different
overall
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
although
i
am
slightly
let
down
with
it
it
is
still
good
it
is
a
little
more
cidery
than
i
would
like
notes
i
can
tell
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
as
its
complex
without
being
annoying
this
is
not
something
that
will
see
my
fridge
too
often
though
as
sour
apples
spices
and
sweetness
is
not
for
me
with
that
said
though
this
is
a
must
try
d
very
drinkable
aside
from
the
price
i
would
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
well
sustained
white
head
nose
is
of
champagne
and
sour
apples
taste
is
somewhat
having
a
wheaty
quality
with
a
sour
apple
finish
mouthfeel
has
a
champagne
quality
to
it
quite
bubbly
and
lively
drinkability
is
ok
one
is
pretty
good
to
try
but
i
am
not
sure
how
the
second
one
will
go
down
the
mouth
is
light
not
at
all
complex
and
not
very
inspiring
at
all
the
lack
of
body
and
flavor
make
it
drinkable
but
i
wont
drink
one
of
these
ever
again
i
dont
see
a
point
the
smell
was
what
i
would
call
typical
and
expected
mild
tart
apple
sweet
fruits
candy
sugar
mild
yeast
and
almost
no
hop
presence
i
was
impressed
with
the
taste
which
was
rather
mild
despite
the
nose
doughy
yeast
and
sweettart
fruits
blended
very
well
to
give
a
nice
and
varying
mouthfeel
which
started
with
the
carbonation
tingle
then
went
through
sweet
and
sour
and
ended
smooth
but
almost
watery
overall
a
very
decent
fruit
beer
this
is
a
refreshing
fruity
beer
and
quite
drinkable
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
from
unibroue
it
would
be
a
decent
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
can
find
beter
summer
beers
at
much
cheaper
prices
i
could
see
having
a
couple
of
these
in
hot
weather
but
its
something
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
good
but
not
great
the
carbonation
was
a
little
too
low
and
the
mouthfeel
a
little
sticky
for
my
liking
i
would
have
liked
a
crisper
finish
but
i
concede
that
may
have
made
it
too
ciderlike
for
others
d
lower
alcohol
content
than
most
of
the
unibroue
brews
this
is
very
drinkable
good
for
company
that
doesnt
like
beer
but
likes
wine
a
good
foot
in
the
door
for
those
not
into
beer
yet
just
no
reason
to
drink
this
one
really
more
like
sparkling
water
really
if
the
beer
was
less
carbinated
i
might
have
been
able
to
enjoy
some
very
light
balenced
flavors
but
with
this
much
carbination
nothing
much
comes
through
i
would
also
like
to
try
this
beer
with
more
apple
flavors
i
think
it
would
be
nice
with
all
that
carbination
really
i
would
like
to
see
the
carbination
scaled
back
or
the
taste
scaled
up
feels
okay
in
the
mouth
like
a
decent
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
just
weak
apple
is
present
but
very
little
character
besides
its
not
really
active
and
bold
like
a
good
lambic
but
its
also
not
cloying
like
fruit
beers
can
be
if
you
like
pyramids
apricot
wheat
or
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
give
the
ephemere
line
a
taste
overall
i
like
the
taste
of
coriander
in
food
and
i
like
the
spiciness
in
this
beer
but
i
cant
find
a
clear
link
between
the
two
i
think
i
might
just
need
to
try
some
other
beers
with
coriander
in
general
i
like
this
take
on
an
apple
beer
but
dont
know
if
ill
be
shelling
out
over
2
bucks
a
bottle
for
it
again
really
carbonated
almost
too
much
thin
champagne
like
body
i
am
not
extremely
impressed
however
i
wont
give
up
on
fruit
beers
yet
the
taste
is
like
a
really
good
witbier
blanche
de
chambly
perhaps
with
a
few
jolly
ranchers
dropped
in
and
dissolved
very
interesting
mix
with
incredibly
drinkable
results
the
beer
is
very
light
in
body
and
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
without
it
getting
too
cloyingly
sweet
even
not
a
fan
of
fruity
beer
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
pours
hazy
golden
color
amost
like
a
hefeweizen
with
a
fizzy
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
green
apple
and
yeast
taste
is
apple
yeast
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
expected
more
complexity
from
this
but
its
still
ok
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
but
its
not
bad
if
you
like
apples
you
should
thoroughly
enjoy
this
one
the
beer
poured
a
belgian
style
dull
gold
color
with
a
few
undiscovered
sources
of
carbonation
a
constant
quarter
inch
of
bright
head
retained
throughout
the
drinking
the
nose
was
strong
on
sweet
lightly
sour
apple
tones
the
flavor
of
the
beer
proved
to
be
quite
sweet
and
apple
infused
without
pushing
over
the
limits
of
turning
into
an
applebeer
alcopop
type
deal
a
slightly
creamy
texture
developed
as
this
one
warmed
and
the
beer
proved
to
be
an
enjoyable
digestif
but
too
sweet
to
be
sessioned
and
not
my
favorite
style
still
an
interesting
rendition
of
this
style
of
beer
taste
was
applelike
very
refreshing
and
combined
with
the
usual
witbier
tastes
the
wheat
base
was
pretty
solid
and
the
yeast
profile
was
just
right
drinkability
was
very
good
when
my
husband
handed
me
the
beer
and
said
its
all
you
i
knew
when
he
meant
there
was
a
lot
of
coriander
in
this
beer
something
he
cant
stand
from
the
aroma
to
the
taste
you
know
its
there
and
not
hidden
its
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thick
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
very
apple
spicy
and
tart
taste
it
was
okay
but
nothing
id
want
another
of
i
just
know
that
the
wife
really
enjoyed
her
samples
as
did
i
this
brews
was
very
fizzy
and
softly
carbonated

just
a
top
notch
summer
drinker
ephemere
apple
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
nice
apple
dominates
flavor
is
also
pretty
good
im
not
the
biggest
fruit
beer
fan
and
i
can
say
this
is
fruit
beer
done
well
the
apple
flavor
while
strong
was
balanced
by
a
wheat
base
it
never
got
sweet
or
cloying
this
beer
is
quite
light
i
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
recommended
overall
the
highlights
of
this
beer
for
me
are
the
mouthfeel
and
the
sublimely
balanced
apple
flavor
it
might
not
be
for
everyone
but
it
should
definitely
be
tried
by
everyone
so
yeah
when
it
comes
to
apple
beverages
this
completely
blows
away
any
of
the
mass
produced
ciders
that
one
would
find
definitely
worth
a
try
and
if
it
were
just
a
little
bit
cheaper
it
would
be
a
great
summer
staple
cheers
very
nice
but
not
a
session
beer
crisp
for
a
hot
summer
day
pours
into
the
tulip
glass
with
a
tremendous
head
that
fades
away
slowly
leaving
only
a
few
spots
of
lacing
behind
color
is
green
apple
with
numerous
small
bubbles
theres
yeast
in
the
bottle
nose
of
very
sweet
apple
and
that
signature
unibroue
yeast
taste
is
something
like
apple
juice
not
beerlike
at
all
fading
to
a
kind
of
watery
concoction
like
a
glass
of
water
with
an
apple
jolly
rancher
dissolved
in
it
a
little
bit
of
yeast
is
evident
and
everything
finishes
on
an
ever
so
bitter
note
though
id
stop
short
of
attributing
it
to
hops
mouth
is
watery
and
flatly
carbonated
in
other
words
it
feels
sort
of
flat
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
offensive
but
not
inviting
either
drinkability
pretty
killer
for
a
fruit
beer
especially
on
a
hot
milwaukee
night
if
you
are
thirsty
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
be
very
drinkable
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
an
excellent
match
for
any
chocolatey
dessert
i
had
it
with
molten
chocolate
soufflé
may
also
work
well
with
cheesecake
or
as
a
marinade
for
pork
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
regularly
but
as
a
change
of
pace
its
okay
a
sweet
treat
of
a
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summers
day
like
today
highly
drinkable
but
the
high
level
of
rs
could
make
it
difficult
as
a
all
day
session
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
with
a
slight
hint
of
green
smell
is
that
of
wheat
with
some
green
apple
in
it
the
green
apple
is
more
evident
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
with
strong
wheat
flavors
and
a
bit
of
orange
citrus
good
mouthfeel
with
some
nice
carbination
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
for
hot
weather
this
beer
was
kind
of
disappointing
i
was
hoping
for
more
fruit
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
didnt
wow
me
overall
an
interesting
beer
unibroue
always
packs
a
crapload
of
carbonation
in
their
beers
and
this
seems
to
give
it
an
elegant
characteristic
to
it
as
if
it
was
a
sweet
champagne
but
as
far
as
beer
goes
an
interesting
alternative
and
quite
tasty
but
not
one
i
would
have
cravings
for
not
a
big
fan
of
the
coriander
pours
out
a
hazy
brass
color
with
a
violently
fizzy
head
that
disappears
within
seconds
smell
is
strongly
of
sour
apple
laffy
taffy
and
hints
of
coriander
tastes
of
granny
smith
apples
coriander
and
light
yeast
tones
very
tart
and
refreshing
but
thins
out
too
much
in
the
finish
and
becomes
seltzery
despite
the
lack
of
head
this
is
very
bubbly
and
champagnelike
its
a
little
thin
in
the
finish
however
quite
drinkable
as
a
hybrid
of
cider
and
ale
d
meant
to
be
sipped
but
could
easily
be
chugged
as
opposed
to
most
beers
i
actually
thought
this
was
more
complex
before
it
had
warmed
once
warm
the
apple
dominated
and
took
away
some
of
the
wheat
beer
characteristics
this
is
the
second
of
my
ventures
into
the
unibroue
line
of
brews
and
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
good
it
is
pricey
here
its
about
7
50
for
a
4
pack
but
its
a
nice
change
up
to
the
regular
line
up
of
brews
for
me
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
appears
to
be
seasonal
ill
have
to
give
the
other
ephemere
seasonals
a
try
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
quickly
fading
1
finger
head
and
ok
lace
good
green
apple
smells
mixed
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweet
light
malt
if
the
intent
here
was
to
make
a
beer
with
nothing
more
that
green
appple
flavor
they
should
have
made
a
cider
as
beer
goes
i
think
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
alcoholic
carbonated
apple
water
very
flavorless
except
for
the
apple
a
definate
summer
beer
very
light
its
liteness
does
give
it
high
drinkability
though
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
on
a
hotter
than
hell
summers
day
a
well
made
beer
but
just
too
wimpy
for
me
pours
a
light
colored
ale
with
great
retention
and
no
disitation
the
scent
of
apple
and
citrus
is
very
present
the
taste
is
very
lite
and
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
another
great
beer
from
unibroue
and
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
overall
very
dissapointing
not
much
to
it
but
green
apple
flavors
and
a
touch
of
wheat
no
hops
and
no
malt
more
like
flavored
water
than
a
beer
i
wouldnt
waste
the
money
or
time
d
not
bad
at
all
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
a
more
than
acceptable
replacement
for
a
dry
apple
cider
drinkability
highly
drinkable
not
filling
clean
finish
fine
flavor
not
too
inebriating
but
sensually
pleasing
i
had
my
doubts
about
this
one
but
it
has
really
surpassed
expectations
we
sit
here
drinking
the
750ml
bottle
it
is
much
less
carbonated
than
expected
maybe
we
got
a
bad
bottleor
maybe
not
it
does
have
the
right
smell
the
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
it
smells
of
apple
but
the
taste
does
not
really
represent
the
scent
the
flavor
is
fake
it
tastes
like
apple
but
does
not
taste
natural
mouthfeel
it
is
less
carbonated
than
expected
and
almost
has
a
bitter
after
taste
it
is
drinkable
but
disappointing
notes
fruit
beers
are
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
which
is
a
shame
because
magic
hat
9
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
got
into
better
beer
oh
well
i
guess
tastes
develop
drinkability
the
strong
apple
taste
adn
the
high
carbonation
make
this
hard
for
me
to
finish
but
its
not
so
bad
i
wont
have
one
once
in
awhile
its
just
not
something
i
would
sit
back
and
drink
very
oftenall
day
notes
certainly
a
favorite
of
mine
when
it
comes
to
fruit
beers
but
not
a
style
i
lean
towards
to
begin
with
another
good
beer
overall
from
unibroue
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
by
far
the
best
of
the
ephemere
series
i
like
this
it
says
on
the
bottle
its
a
refreshing
summer
delight
it
disintigrates
to
nothing
and
leaves
only
a
few
scarce
dots
of
lace
wheat
and
pale
malt
in
the
nose

ok
i
heard
alot
about
this
and
i
was
really
stoked
to
see
it
in
my
local
beer
shop
so
i
immediatly
bought
a
750ml
bottle
and
ran
home
upon
opening
it
smelled
of
lovely
green
apples
the
cork
still
smells
like
apple
candy
and
it
poured
out
a
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
the
taste
was
somewhat
of
a
let
down
though
didnt
really
have
the
strong
apple
taste
that
the
aroma
hinted
too
it
kinda
tasted
like
a
watered
down
hefe
with
just
a
hint
of
green
apple
i
dont
know
but
i
just
didnt
dig
it
at
all
i
was
decent
but
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
light
with
good
carbonation
and
it
was
refreshing
i
only
had
a
glass
full
and
was
done
with
it
damn
very
nice
this
one
especially
as
a
summertime
thirst
quencher
pours
an
eversoslightly
hazy
gold
co2
surges
to
the
top
like
water
falls
at
niagra
incredibly
bubbly
sort
of
reminds
me
of
champaigne
head
is
thick
white
and
fluffy
very
long
lasting
smell
of
green
apples
is
incredily
strong
smell
is
tart
and
somewhat
candylike
underneath
the
apple
if
you
can
dig
that
far
is
a
smell
of
grainy
wheat
flavor
at
first
is
heavily
laden
with
granny
smith
apples
it
also
has
a
very
grainy
wheat
flavor
more
noticeable
after
a
few
sips
aftertaste
is
only
slightly
fruity
and
rather
big
on
the
wheat
light
bodied
brew
with
a
very
rough
mouthfeel
incredibly
drinkable
on
this
hot
august
evening
thirst
quenching
and
flavorful
definitely
a
brew
for
my
fridge
next
summer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
again
very
light
and
refreshing
with
a
crisp
taste
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
nice
summer
day
overall
my
hats
off
to
unibroue
since
coming
to
the
states
and
trying
many
of
their
beers
they
have
truly
impressed
me
noend
with
all
of
them
they
are
definitely
one
of
the
greats
thats
for
sure
this
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
that
had
a
slight
haze
to
it
but
was
very
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
an
off
white
head
that
had
a
creamy
consistency
and
lasted
fairly
well
but
when
it
fell
it
went
fast
some
lace
visible
but
nothing
outstanding
the
aromas
were
mostly
of
green
fresh
picked
granny
smith
apples
some
spices
were
present
clove
cinnamon
coriander
wheat
grains
and
other
fruits
could
be
smelled
banana
orange
lemon
the
tastes
were
a
mirror
to
the
nose
mostly
green
apples
wheat
grain
fruits
lemon
banana
spices
clove
mostly
with
some
coriander
it
left
an
aftertaste
of
fresh
apple
pie
with
a
wheat
flour
crust
it
was
light
bodied
it
started
off
a
little
on
the
over
carbonated
sharp
side
but
calmed
down
fairly
fast
it
reminded
me
of
champagne
with
apples
in
it
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
was
very
refreshing

it
quenched
my
thirst
and
was
pleasant
to
drink
yet
another
thanks
to
kluk
for
this
one
apparently
premier
just
got
it
in
what
an
outstanding
cure
for
the
apalling
utah
heat
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
whipped
white
head
this
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
had
unibroue
yeast
and
wheat
at
the
base
with
an
ethereal
sour
apple
aroma
dancing
around
i
wanted
my
small
glass
to
turn
into
a
pitcher
so
i
could
chug
it
taste
was
refreshing
wheatyeast
with
a
very
subtle
sweetness
the
smell
was
deceivingly
sweet
but
i
was
glad
to
find
the
taste
not
so
finish
was
crispl
and
slightly
tart
with
powerful
granny
smith
apple
notes
but
not
sweet
like
cider
the
apple
notes
lingered
best
summer
beer
ive
had
this
year
wow
what
a
nice
aroma
this
beer
has
immediately
after
popping
the
cork
on
this
750ml
bottle
pleasant
thoughts
of
sour
apple
jolly
ranchers
come
to
mind
its
very
fizzy
and
the
head
is
enormously
fluffy
dry
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
very
crisp
the
apple
flavor
is
pretty
reserved
but
very
pleasant
im
not
too
familiar
with
coriander
and
curacao
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
look
for
in
the
flavor
for
them
but
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
thats
not
too
sweet
not
too
sour
with
just
the
right
amount
of
everything
a
lovely
beer
great
for
summer
quaffing
i
always
anticipate
anything
new
i
get
to
try
from
unibroue
which
is
absolutely
a
world
class
brewery
on
to
ephemere
an
intriguing
beer
indeed
pours
a
pale
apricot
with
only
light
visible
through
the
glass
the
head
is
big
and
very
fizzy
dissapating
quickly
to
nothing
and
there
is
no
signs
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
faint
with
an
apple
sweetness
this
is
a
very
balanced
beer
with
a
definite
apple
theme
that
is
not
overdone
sweet
red
delicious
apples
support
the
malts
up
front
and
almost
lip
puckering
granny
smith
apples
travel
with
the
hops
in
the
back
end
there
is
a
refreshing
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
dry
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
i
would
have
no
problems
drinking
a
750ml
or
two
pours
a
yellowish
color
with
a
nice
tight
white
head
aroma
is
strongly
apple
scented
with
a
bit
of
spice
underneath
taste
was
kind
of
a
surprise
with
the
apple
flavor
very
subdued
and
very
well
balanced
there
was
no
sickening
sweetness
or
overpowering
fruitiness
as
in
some
fruit
beers
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
is
such
a
beautiful
thing
this
is
what
fruity
beer
should
taste
like
the
crispness
of
the
apples
and
mild
hint
of
hops
combine
religiously
making
this
one
bad
ass
brew
the
little
fairy
on
the
front
is
pretty
cool
too
the
smell
is
of
very
strong
apples
so
i
was
expecting
something
sugary
but
alas
it
was
not
the
head
lasted
a
little
bit
but
died
down
in
the
end
which
was
to
be
expected
i
am
gitty
like
a
school
girl
over
this
one
horray
for
unibroue
and
another
one
of
thier
fantastic
beers
canadians
arent
all
bad
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
there
is
a
great
aroma
of
green
apples
here
the
taste
is
much
the
same
apple
flavor
comes
through
but
the
spices
added
make
this
a
much
more
complex
brew
its
smooth
highly
refreshing
and
belgian
like
in
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
i
love
this
brew
a
real
good
sessions
beer
and
a
break
from
the
norm
pours
with
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
aroma
is
of
orange
and
coriander
taste
is
very
citrusy
and
finishes
with
the
flavor
of
cider
not
as
much
apple
flavor
i
expected
but
i
got
a
great
tasting
belgian
wit
and
the
apples
add
another
dimension
of
flavor
appearance
is
similar
to
a
wit
hazy
light
golden
approaches
apple
juice
color
but
not
quite
that
pale
the
nice
looking
dense
white
head
has
good
retention
aroma
is
delicate
but
quite
nice
sweet
apple
cinamon
sticks
must
and
fruitcake
nice
tasting
thirst
quencher
takes
just
a
little
getting
used
to
on
the
first
try
but
it
definitely
grows
on
you
i
am
happy
to
discover
that
this
beer
is
not
very
cidery
or
acidic
theres
just
a
little
tart
senstion
but
not
a
lot
i
reminisce
about
the
green
apple
taffy
i
enjoyed
during
my
youth
as
i
drink
the
musty
undertones
really
add
a
pleasant
quality
to
this
beer
just
a
slight
amount
of
bittering
is
noticed
lively
carbonation
is
noted
in
the
mouthfeel
body
is
a
little
better
than
medium
i
like
this
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
has
a
great
aroma
of
apples
with
some
spicyness
and
yeast
notes
a
really
distinct
taste
light
ale
with
hints
of
apple
beers
like
this
are
really
not
my
thing
but
this
is
quite
nice
theres
a
certain
spiciness
that
comes
thru
the
tart
apple
flavor
an
effervescent
mouthfeel
completes
the
picture
overall
i
would
have
to
say
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
has
a
very
unique
flavor
and
a
great
tartness
thats
perfect
for
a
summers
day
dont
know
if
i
would
have
more
then
2
but
still
very
nice
indeed
taste
was
not
as
fruity
as
the
nose
moreover
a
subtle
mix
of
wheat
finesse
the
light
golden
malt
of
a
summer
ale
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
from
coriander
and
curacao
and
the
nascent
sweet
and
sour
of
the
apple
adding
some
character
in
the
background
had
an
easy
slide
of
a
mouthfeel
suprisingly
no
fizz
an
inviting
drink
good
though
not
the
best
fruit
beer
but
definitely
better
than
most
pours
out
to
a
pale
golden
forming
a
huge
purewhite
seafoam
head
with
superior
retention
and
nice
lacing
adding
the
yeast
turns
it
a
beautiful
murky
white
carbonation
is
strong
aroma
is
intoxicating
fresh
green
sour
apples
perfectly
in
harmony
with
the
trademark
unibroue
yeast
notes
cloves
and
a
hint
of
banana
to
round
it
out
one
can
smell
green
apples
across
the
room
oh
boy
what
a
taste
amazing
stuff
this
is
tastes
exactly
as
it
smells
however
the
green
apples
are
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
thought
by
aroma
but
still
tart
and
juicy
complementing
the
crisp
wheat
and
delicate
pale
malt
body
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
like
champagne
with
a
brisk
clean
mouthfeel
and
slightly
astringent
finish
hops
are
only
in
the
background
and
slightly
perfumy
and
contribute
just
enough
bitterness
to
complement
the
sweet
apples
very
easy
to
drink
however
i
would
have
liked
just
a
tad
more
malt
sweetness
this
is
great
stuff
indeed
another
masterpiece
from
unibroue
i
can
only
imagine
what
the
peach
tastes
like
sampled
at
from
the
vine
monthly
beer
tasting
aug
4th
2003
i
honestly
dont
much
see
the
point
in
a
granny
smith
beer
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
quick
lacing
strong
aroma
of
sour
apple
and
wheat
lightbodied
with
a
character
consistent
with
other
beers
of
the
style
sour
apple
dominates
the
flavor
along
with
some
wheat
and
spice
in
the
background
the
finish
is
rather
crisp
and
stays
with
the
apple
theme
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
just
dont
see
the
point
in
beers
like
this
flavor
is
much
less
appley
than
i
had
anticipated
the
malts
and
coriander
come
through
very
nicely
and
the
balance
is
wonderful
apple
is
the
perfect
choice
for
the
style
which
i
believe
is
something
close
to
a
witbier
the
coriander
is
very
spicy
and
lends
the
perfect
compliment
to
the
sour
apple
flavoring
im
not
sure
what
curacao
tastes
like
but
an
odd
sweetness
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
apple
so
perhaps
that
was
it
malts
are
light
and
allow
the
other
flavors
to
take
precedence
body
is
very
light
and
the
carbonation
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
high
for
my
tastes
almost
like
champagne
with
vigorous
small
bubbles
im
not
really
into
that
but
i
cant
say
it
didnt
work
for
the
beer
great
summertime
quaff
drinkability
hard
to
believe
theres
any
alcohol
in
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
best
as
a
postdinner
dessert
beer
i
shared
this
with
my
wife
a
moderate
beer
drinker
and
she
loved
it
perfect
for
unwinding
at
the
end
of
the
day
light
bodied
and
refreshing
but
just
not
tasty
enough
even
apart
from
the
offflavor
to
make
me
want
to
drink
much
of
it
overall
impression
unibroue
is
just
an
amazing
brewery
this
is
another
great
innovation
of
theirs
im
thoroughly
impressed
the
bottle
label
says
truly
a
refreshing
summer
delight
in
every
sip
i
couldnt
agree
more
my
girlfriend
who
doesnt
drink
beer
at
all
aside
from
the
sips
i
require
her
to
take
of
every
beer
that
i
have
said
it
was
her
favorite
one
she
has
tried
so
far
and
that
says
a
lot
a
testament
to
the
likeability
of
this
beer
atleast
a
good
ale
that
pours
a
thick
white
head
leaving
little
lace
there
is
a
distinct
apple
flavor
with
good
carbonation
but
there
is
a
lemon
citrusy
tartness
to
it
it
has
a
clean
mouthfeel
and
finishes
smooth
light
summery
brew
very
easy
to
drink
a

this
is
a
specialty
kind
of
selection
and
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
yet
i
would
buy
it
to
share
with
others
as
a
classy
alternative
to
the
standard
ale
its
fruitiness
lends
itself
well
as
a
tasty
summer

with
a
foamy
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
rich
lace
the
instant
you
open
the
bottle
a
strong
aroma
of
fresh
picked
apples
is
apparent
once
poured
into
the
glass
a
light
underlying
yeastiness
was
also
detectable
moderate

body
with
a
spritzy
and
zesty
texture

the
strong

quite

one
of
the
best
possibly
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
boy
this
is
good
maybe
its
just
that
its
summer
and
this
hits
the
spot
i
love
the
honeycream
color
and
the
puffy
white
head
on
this
beer
the
nose
is
that
of
granny
smith
apple
ala
jolly
rancher
candy
the
taste
is
that
of
a
good
french
cider
yet
with
a
great
beer
taste
on
the
tail
end
the
bubbles
here
are
fine
like
champagne
and
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
with
very
fine
again
champagne
like
carbonation
the
addition
of
orange
and
coriander
is
ever
so
faint
and
does
wonders
for
this
beers
overall
complexity
a
cleansing
bitterness
prevails
on

also

big

the

is

like
a
sour
apple
blowpop
there
seems
to
be
some
alcohol
to
the
smell
even
though
its
a
low
abv
the
taste
has
some
apple
tartness
with
a
bit
of
spice
probably
from
the
coriander
added
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
refreshing
brews
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
just
a
little
bubbly
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
and
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
the
750mls
easy
definately
going
to
get
some
of

itself
with

were

seltzery
white
tiny
bubbled
the
head
settled
down
after
a
few
moments
and
i
was
able
to
fill
the
glass
the
aroma
is
perhaps
the
most
noteworthy
aspect
of
this
beer
granny
smith
apples
more
to
the
candyish
jolly
rancher
side
of
the
spectrum
but
as
the
beer
warmed
a
sweet
cotton
candy
element
emerged
as
well
the
green
apple
notes
were
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
and
could
have
been
taken
more
for
a
yeast
byproduct
than
a
brewing
adjunct
the
overall
effect
was
a
belgian
take
on
fruit
beer
not
spectacular
but
interesting
highly
effervescentcloudy
straw

with
a

green

green

a

apples
tastes
nice
not
sweet
like
a
cider
very
crisp
refreshing
a
nice
summer
drink
but
only
one
every
now
and
then
please
good
its
a
little
tastier
than
the
original
because
of
the
apples
but
its
not
really
exciting
it
does
get
pretty
nice
at
temperature
though
apples
butter
and
pepper
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
filled
with
apples
and
not
much
more
the
flavor
tasted
like
a
5050
mix
of
your
normal
unibroue
beer
and
apple
cider
quite
enjoyable
it
was
a
little
sweet
but
it
was
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
when
first
poured
it
was
a
straw
yellow
with
a
slight
green
hue
with
a
rich
white
head
the
smell
of
fruit
reminded
me
of
apples
granny
smith
and
macintosh
for
starters
the
taste
was
mostly
of
apples
and
a
hint
of
orange
and
spices
the
front
of
the
bottle
says
ale
brewed
with
apple
juice
coriander
and
curacao
it
was
not
overly
sweet
or
bitter
but
there
was
an
effervesent
feel
in
my
mouth
after
each
sip
very
well
balance
for
an
ale
with
fruit
obviously
bubblegum
sweet
apple
presence
that
finishes
with
a
brief
peppery
note
for
some
reason
the
granny
smith
green
apple
flavor
is
not
really
detectable
within
the
flavor
as
much
as
in
the
aroma
the
light
creamy
apple
sour
tone
and
high
carbonation
mixed
with
the
spices
of
this
lighter
palatable
ale
add
an
very
nice
twang
to
the
flavor
profile
drinkability
a
definite
easy
going
beer
very
drinkable
great
retreat
from
the
summer
heat
one
well
done
fruit
flavored
ale

a
hint
of
dried
apricot
and
some
spiciness
the
taste
to
me
was
of
less
apple
than
the
nose
had
suggested
in
fact
i
would
say
it
was
somewhat
light
and
creamy
with
a
bubblegum
finish
not
sweet
at
all
but
more
subtle
and
refreshing

overall
this
is
a

pumpkin
ale
i
really
like
the
little

of
tartness
that
this
beer
has
its
very
original
im
definitely
getting
a
few
bottles
of
this
next
year
o
oktoberfest
meets
pumpkins
and
spice
makes
total
sense
i
found
this
to
be
as
good
as
most
märzen
but
closer
to
and
akin
to
most
pumpkins
perhaps
just
ahead
of
midpack
a
lager
that
is
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
spicing
as
pumpkin
beers
go
i
would
not
choose
this
one
again
nice
places
but
little
else
o
i
like
this
brew
it
stands
out
because
of
the
lager
base
the
description
reveals
this
is
a
pumpkin
lager
and
it
tastes
and
feels
like
a
lager
very
thin
and
a
tone
of
wateriness
this
is
not
one
of
terrapins
best
offerings
there
is
a
spicy
thread
of
clove
nutmeg
ginger
and
anise
but
i
dont
get
much
of
the
pumpkin
gourd
or
pumpkin
pie
this
is
an
interesting
and
different
seasonal
beer
by
terrapin

thinner

sweeter

other

overall
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
the
pumpkin

is
very
up

but
its
not
over
bearing
its
not
overly
sweet
but
it
has
the
right
hint
of
sweetness
id
certainly
consider
it
a
goto
pumpkin
ale
for
this
time
of
year
had
at
jessies
on
fire
in
auburndale
it
did
keep
a
pretty
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
did
taste
a
bit
moldy
i
am
going
back
and
try
this
one
again
and
make
sure
it
has
a
2014
date
if
i
get
the
same
profile
i
will
leave
this
review
as
is
otherwise
drink
with
caution
o
a
very
seasonally
festive
brew
that
is
tasty
and
easy
drinking
definitely
worth
a
try
and
worth
your
money
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
overall
pretty
mild
and
i
dont
get
much
pumpkin
spice
flavor
either
i
wouldnt
say
that
that
is
a
bad
thing
but
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
to
me
than
anything
else
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
nuttiness
to
it
though
pumpkin
lager
light
refreshing
hint
of
pumpkin

very
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
very
rich

nice
bready

with
the

pumpkin
spices
one
of
the
better
12
ounce
bottle
versions
i
have
had
i
think
there
are
better
representations
of
this
type
i
think
the
flavor
is
good
as
a
novelty
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
again
on
this
one
a
pretty
standard
feeling
pumpkin
brew
it
displays
a
beautiful
orange
clarity
and
hanging
white
collar
the
aroma
and
flavor
falls
into
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
category
a
nice
balance
of
malty
sweetness
verse
cinnamon
spice
addition
fairly
clean
crisp
and
easy
drinking
lots
of
spices
not
a
lot
of
pumpkin
taste
o
solid
pumpkin
beer
one
i
will
revisit
if
the
body
was
thicker
this
would
be
a
winner
for
sure
one
of
the
spicier
pumpkin
brews
that
i
actually
enjoy
quite
a
bit
the
ginger
spice
feel
is
super
fresh
and
there
is
a
nice
maltiness
and
some
pumpkin
to
support
those
spices
the
beer
is
bright
orange
with
just
a
mild
haze
beige
head
that
settles
as
a
thin
ring
on
top
aromas
of
lager
fall
spice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
some
squash
character
a
bit
sweet
but
not
too
an
interesting
take
on
a
fall
seasonal
going
the
lager
route
as
opposed
to
the
typical
ale
choice
crisp
finish
with
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
a
solid
beer
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
oktoberfest
andor
pumpkin
brews
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
seasonal
fruit
beer
not
overpowering
not
too
cloying
to
my
taste
just
right
spike
and
the
crew
have
done
it
again
this
is

nutmeg
and
i
will
be
honest
here
i
am
getting
really
tired
of
smelling
the
whole
spice
rack
in
these
beers
balance
people
and
this
coming
from
a
selfavowed
hophead
who
likes
dipas
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
creamier
than
many
of
its
ale
counterparts
the
taste
was
really
muted
and
frankly
kind
of
watery
what
happened
to
the
spices
from
the
nose
they
seemed
to
have
disappeared
finish
was
rather
bland
and
nondescript
unless
they
tweak
the
recipe
for
next
year
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
beer
after
the
2013
edition
i
purchased
this
beer
in
total
wine
who
gives
a
brief
write
up
of
each
of
their
6
packsor
4
packs
in
this
case
the
beer
was
described
more
or
less
as
a
cross
between
a
pumpkin
beer
and
an
oktoberfest
both
of
which
i
enjoy
the
color
was
a
nice
amber
with
very
little
head
much
of
what
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
kind
i
thought
it
smelled
fantastic
however
the
taste
was
where
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
i
was
just
expecting
a
bit
more
the
pumpkin
was
a
bit
overwhelming
and
to
be
honest
it
tasted
extremely
similar
to
blue
moons
harvest
pumpkin
ale
which
is
roughly
the
same
price
for
a
6
pack
i
realize
this
beer
is
not
an
ale
however
to
me
the
taste
was
pretty
close
like
i
said
it
is
a
good
beer
just
gave
me
nothing
that
made
it
stand
out
and
made
me
want
to
look
for
it
again
next
fall
a
desent
beer
overall
a
very
good
octoberfest
beer
that
is
well
balanced
in
its
own
right
the
malty
sweetness
plays
well
with
the
spicing
and
evens
out
any
of
that
astringency
from
spice
and
pumpkin
very
drinkable
o
very
sessionable
i
bet
its
great
on
tap
a
nice
halloween
treat
had
this
pour
from
a
bottle
into
a
tasting
glass
this
was
on
a
night
when
i
was
trying
several
other
beers
so
there
is
an
accurate
benachmark
to
go
off
of
this
was
one
of
the
lower
ranking
pumpkins
that
felt
like
it
had
a
higher
abv
than
most
others
ive
had
i
like
my
pumpkins
mild
and
this
one
was
hoppy
like
other
terrapin
beers
ive
had
it
was
also
spicy
with
a
tough
finish
on
the
darker
golden
side
where
as
i
prefer
the
lighter
pumpkins
overall
finishes
in
the
lower
half
of
pumpkins
ive
had
picked
this
up
in
a
mixed
6
pack
from
whole
foods
in
pa
the
pumpkin
spice
is
muted
vs
other
seasonal
beers
that
claim
to
cater
to
pumpkophiles
tastes
but
it
comes
through
quite
well
overall
a
great
seasonal
offering
by
terrapin
pours
an
amber
orange
color
that
is
not
transparent
it
glows
like
a
jack
o
lantern
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
good
thick
off
white
head
that
stays
a
few
seconds
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
all
pumpkin
spices
a
lot
like
pumpkin
pie
taste
just
like
it
smells
full
bodied
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
not
the
best
pumpkin
or
oktoberfest
beer
i
have
had
but
i
definitely
would
drink
another
decent
carbonation
level
and
very
full
bodied
flavor
lingers
for
quite
a
bit
not
smooth
a
little
gritty
not
as
balanced
as
it
good
be
its
sweet
bitter
than
sort
of
sweet
again
at
the
end
still
pretty
drinkable
i
think
the
recipe
could
be
tweaked
just
a
tad
and
it
could
be
great
not
just
good
like
it
is
now
still
glad
to
try
another
terrapin
beer
even
if
its
not
my
preferred
style
o
very
drinkable
however
i
would
not
rate
it
as
a
top
pumpkin
ale
or
an
octoberfest
o
my
previous
experience
with
pumpkin
beer
is
blue
moon
and
shipyard
this
is
a
step
up
and
very
drinkable
but
it
is
never
gonna
be
my
favorite
seasonal
o
this
beer
is
supposedly
a
variation
of
an
oktoberfest
with
pumpkins
and
spices
but
i
dont
get
any
of
the
malts
that
is
usually
associated
with
a
märzen
it
tastes
more
like
a
pumpkin
ale
but
with
a
slight
bit
of
a
clean
mouthfeel
that
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
o
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
pumpkin
style
popular
around
fall
but
overall
not
impressive
enough
to
warrant
a
second
purchase
would
recommend
this
offering
is
a
lager
unlike
most
pumpkin
beers
which
are
ales
still
this
is
a
solid
effort
and
a
tasty
fall
seasonal
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
not
a
bad
pumpkin
based
beer
worth
a
try
this
is
a
good
offering
interesting
pumpkin
offering
and
would
be
worth
trying
again
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
in
ct
overall
worth
a
try
but
not
something
that
i
would
see
continuing
to
produce
they
would
be
better
off
making
a
real
pumpkin
ale
think
of
terrapin
as
the
dfh
of
the
south
they
make
some
good
brews
but
other
times
its
like
wtf
were
you
thinking
terrapin
pumpkinfest
from
terrapin
beer
company
is
copper
colored
in
my
pint
glass
not
a
lot
of
foam
here
i
can
smell
faint
pumpkin
with
some
spices
thrown
in
as
far
as
flavor
goes
its
decent
everything
is
accounted
for
there
just
aint
much
special
going
on
here
i
would
probably
pass
on
this
in
the
future
at
the
current
price
as
a
note
of
interest
my
beer
was
a
4pack
and
cost
9
99
to
me
this
is
a
little
pricey
for
an
average
beer
terrapin
put
these
in
6ers
and
i
could
see
myself
buying
some
more
in
the
future
the
taste
is
slightly
caramel
tinged
with
some
woodiness
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
mild
grain
toastiness
and
light
herbal
hop
flavor
with
a
gentle
fruity
tinge
of
pumpkin
flesh
adding
an
almost
melon
or
vegetal
taste
with
a
mild
spice
in
the
finish
giving
a
unified
flavor
profile
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
whether
it
is
a
lager
or
not
i
actuall
like
the
way
the
lager
qualities
work
with
the
spiciness
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
with
a
more
dry
character
in
general
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
but
it
could
only
get
better
if
the
taste
if
the
taste
was
better
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
this
but
if
it
was
there
and
i
had
a
choice
i
might
choose
this
over
other
pumpkin
alelike
beers
o
just
a
big
disappointment
i
liked
the
idea
of
this
beer
but
i
have
no
clue
where
that
weird
bacon
flavor
is
coming
from
just
unbearable
overall
i
too
like
the
idea
of
combining
these
two
fall
styles
and
favorites
of
mine
in
the
fall
it
feels
and
tastes
more
like
an
oktoberfest
with
pumpkin
flavor
easy
to
drink
at
6
10
but
has
enough
pumpkin
flavor
to
not
be
a
session
beer
cheers
oterrapin
makes
great
beer
but
this
one
was
disappointing
it
is
a
spice
bomb
i
was
expecting
more
pumpkin
o
i
think
of
this
more
as
a
hybrid
of
oktoberfest
and
pumpkin
beer
rather
than
just
a
pumpkin
beer
kind
of
interesting
that
it
is
a
lager
rather
than
an
ale
i
generally
like
pumpkin
beers
but
i
was
not
the
hugest
fan
of
this
one
it
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
oktoberfest
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
o
a
nice
pumpkin
lager
but
a
little
simplistic
lagering
seems
to
have
made
smoother
and
easier
drinking
however
nutmeg
stands
out
a
little
strong
but
i
enjoyed
it
recommended
vintage
try
a
bottle
at
1
year
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pumpkin
aleoktoberfest
hybird
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
produced
a
small
off
white
head
poor
retention
and
it
left
an
average
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
roasted
pumpkin
caramel
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
medium
in
body
this
ale
had
a
malted
grain
base
pumpkin
caramel
and
a
nice
amount
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
in
fact
it
borders
on
being
over
spiced
with
that
said
it
is
a
very
worthy
pumpkin
ale
nice
session
beer
first
example
of
a
oktoberfestpumpkin
ale
i
have
sampled
overall
a
distinctly
betterthanaverage
spiced
pumpkin
ale
not
too
flashy
not
quite
a
dessert
beer
packs
plenty
of
distinctive
flavor
without
being
overbearing
and
feels
like
something
youd
want
to
drink
on
thanksgiving
with
mashed
potatoes
and
stuffing
recommended
id
buy
it
again
in
season
if
i
had
the
opportunity
o
i
thought
they
did
a
good
job
marrying
the
styles
of
an
oktoberfest
and
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
a
nice
unique
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
beer
and
it
just
barely
misses
the
mark
if
the
spice
was
dialed
back
a
little
bit
this
would
be
an
outstanding
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
overall
what
can
i
say
ill
give
this
one
a
whirl
again
but
i
was
kinda
bummed
out
by
this
im
hoping
its
because
ive
been
on
a
porter
and
stout
kick
that
this
one
came
off
as
watery
and
bland
o
this
was
one
of
the
pumpkin
brews
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
well
balanced
and
great
tasting
great
fall
beer
4
5
this
was
a
pumpkin
beer
that
was
closer
to
holiday
spice
than
pumpkin
why
exactly
im
not
too
sure
maybe
it
was
the
balance
of
spices
though
i
would
definitely
say
nutmeg
was
the
most
prominent
and
may
even
argue
it
was
slightly
overpowering
compared
to
the
rest
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
definitely
a
nice
holiday
warmer
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
copper
color
body
with
no
head
or
lace
to
it
the
smell
has
a
very
nice
aray
of
pumpkin
spices
and
pumpkin
flesh
the
taste
is
upfront
of
spices
and
then
a
mellow
flavor
of
pumpkin
come
throug
the
mouth
feel
is
good
almost
the
constincey
of
a
lager
well
balanced
and
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
o
youd
better
like
nutmeg
if
you
wanna
get
into
this
brew
a
good
stab
at
the
style
but
could
use
some
toning
down
in
the
spice
department
overall
good
like
the
lack
of
bitter
and
the
sweetness
isnt
too
much
very
drinkable
for
6
1
with
no
real
presence
of
alcohol
flavor
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
brew
interesting
its
a
lager
solid
and
from
a
beer
geek
standpoint
a
pretty
cool
idea
lacks
the
fullness
of
the
its
ale
brethren
o
this
was
an
interesting
experiment
but
it
proved
one
thing
to
my
mind
dont
mix
pumpkin
and
marzens
the
ingredients
just
dont
mesh
well
together
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
is
the
most
unique
do
far
this
year
very
tasty
love
the
concept
of
taking
an
ofest
and
a
pumpkin
ale
and
smashing
them
together
a
good
brew
all
around
i
just
have
a
problem
with
the
spicing
upfront
needs
to
be
dialed
down
a
bit
a
fun
brew
to
quaff
back
iii
like
it
the
head
on
this
beer
was
about
average
with
okay
retention
the
aroma
was
excellent
with
strong
but
good
overtones
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
the
beer
had
a
great
hop
flavor
that
is
often
missing
in
this
style
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
a
second
in
general
a
good
beer
for
this
style
it
was
great
overall
this
beer
rocks
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
out
there
and
right
up
there
in
the
argument
for
a
topnotch
pumpkin
beer
would
drink
this
again
and
again
this
is
a
lovely
beer
smells
fresh
and
spicy
and
can
taste
cloves
and
cinnamon
immediately
with
almost
a
fresh
apple
cider
finish
light
and
lovely
i
dont
taste
tons
of
pumpkin
but
this
is
not
a
sweet
beer
at
all
very
spicy
really
great
fall
beer
pours
a
very
lightly
hazed
auburn
color
with
a
slim
head
that
shrinks
to
a
bubbly
collar
the
aroma
is
brimming
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
some
bread
brown
sugar
and
not
much
pumpkin
but
very
pleasant
all
around
more
of
the
oktoberfest
side
shows
up
first
in
the
flavor
spices
caramel
mild
sweet
bread
toast
smooth
slick
fairly
light
on
the
carbonation
i
can
dig
it
more
nutty
than
pumpkin
nice
clove
and
spice
taste
dirty
brown
and
slightly
opaque
slightly
under
carbonated
paired
nicely
with
pumpkin
pie
gelato
nice
was
more
clove
light
feel
of
a
lager
thought
the
low
carbonation
was
that
first
bottle
but
it
was
the
same
for
the
next
two
this
beer
really
should
be
moved
to
oktoberfest
since
that
is
what
it
is
says
so
on
the
label
at
least
but
i
digress
beer
is
medium
in
body
sweet
and
gourdy
on
the
front
with
a
decent
but
slightly
heavy
on
the
finish
a
little
too
sweeet
for
an
oktoberfest
but
overall
it
is
fine
id
consider
having
it
again
you
get
a
fingers
worth
of
fizzy
foam
which
dissolves
down
at
a
steady
clip
mostly
smaller
bubbles
dark
offwhite
color
the
lacing
is
wispy
to
close
to
nonexistent
very
clear
and
bright
brownish
amber
hued
liquid
becomes
more
zinc
orange
towards
the
outer
reaches
with
a
final
shift
into
yellow
hardly
any
visible
carbonation
big
clove
and
nutmeg
in
the
nose
vanilla
and
cocoa
along
with
of
course
pumpkin
pie
crust
to
scone
for
breadiness
mild
yeastiness
has
a
liqueur
like
quality
even
as
at
times
theres
a
short
burst
of
grass
and
pepper
mediumbodied
has
a
hard
mouth
feel
lacks
graceful
movement
and
flow
the
carbonation
is
light
whats
there
has
a
tight
prickle
dry
on
the
whole
the
ginger
nutmeg
cinnamon
has
a
spicy
cumin
edge
too
cocoa
powder
more
than
honey
brown
sugar
or
caramel
in
keeping
with
dryness
whisper
of
peach
apricot
fruit
any
sweetness
more
derived
from
that
pie
dough
baked
goods
component
loses
any
hoppy
bite
here
but
does
have
a
mineral
water
feel
which
aids
a
fresher
finish
not
sure
it
finds
a
clear
direction
and
then
takes
it
but
pleasant
enough
if
quaffed
uncritically
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
does
not
stand
up
to
the
offerings
from
southern
tier
cigar
city
weyebacher
and
others
i
got
really
excited
when
i
saw
that
terrapin
has
a
pumpkin
beer
taste
has
really
nice
nutmeg
allspice
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
with
a
smokey
flavor
a
pretty
strong
beer
medium
body
decent
head
a
good
brownish
orange
color
i
will
buy
again
i
see
what
they
were
going
for
a
pumpkin
octoberfest
combo
but
really
the
octoberfest
side
of
this
beer
doesnt
come
out
at
all
o
a
good
beer
and
unique
combination
that
actually
works
pretty
well
the
big
question
is
why
is
this
necessary
answer
im
not
sure
it
is
im
also
not
sure
id
return
as
theres
just
not
enough
here
to
keep
me
coming
back
too
light
for
a
pumpkin
and
too
spicy
for
an
oktoberfest
it
leaves
me
wanting
one
of
each
just
to
drink
to
style
but
i
like
to
reward
ingenuity
and
good
craftsmanship
and
this
is
certainly
that
in
spades
a
nice
little
beer
that
ill
return
to
next
fall
but
im
not
sure
id
ever
want
more
than
one
in
a
season
o
another
tasty
seasonal
pumpkin
beer
certainly
worth
another
sampling
o
if
only
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
overall
not
bad
though
overall
its
light
but
flavorful
i
dont
feel
that
the
spices
are
over
done
in
this
one
light
sweetness
that
is
washed
down
with
a
tight
carbonation
overall
a
solid
brew
from
terrapin
i
had
it
2
years
ago
and
was
happy
to
be
able
to
revisit
it
this
year
would
definitely
drink
again
nice
fall
ale
overall
these
are
usually
good
or
bearable
beers
just
dont
think
many
of
these
that
have
pumpkin
as
the
feature
flavor
as
oppose
to
an
additionnote
can
be
great
but
for
the
genre
this
one
is
good
o
not
about
to
become
my
favorite
beer
but
a
good
fall
beer
really
captures
some
good
autumnal
flavors
though
like
most
pumpkin
beers
the
taste
of
actual
pumpkin
is
nowhere
to
be
found
thoroughly
decent
o
good
beer
definitely
a
combo
of
a
octoberfest
and
pumpkin
its
great
for
those
fall
football
days
pours
a
dark
but
clear
amber
moderate
head
scent
brings
ample
pie
spices
and
pumpkin
to
the
front
with
a
nice
cinnamon
and
vanilla
whiff
taste
follows
suit
slightly
brown
sugar
sweet
ample
spices
creamy
pumpkin
pie
with
some
nice
vanilla
notes
a
touch
lighter
than
prefered
needs
a
bit
more
creaminess
solid
seasonal
beer
drinkability
pretty
good
nice
new
pumpkin
beer
to
add
to
my
list
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
definitely
tasty
and
drinkable
and
i
think
its
a
cool
undertaking
to
combine
two
great
fall
styles
oktoberfest
and
pumpkin
beers
however
this
beer
is
only
an
average
example
of
each
style
it
doesnt
have
the
abundance
of
hearty
malt
aromas
and
flavors
that
id
like
in
an
oktoberfest
and
it
only
has
a
mild
and
subtle
pumpkin
pie
aroma
and
flavor
ive
kind
of
run
into
this
a
lot
with
terrapin
when
they
try
to
combine
styles
but
they
definitely
get
bonus
points
for
trying
and
for
creating
a
beer
that
is
both
tasty
and
unique
d
a
solid
seasonal
offering
from
terrapin
while
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
hybrid
of
a
marzen
and
a
pumpkin
ale
this
one
definitely
drifts
towards
pumpkin
ale
status
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
actually
a
lager
deserves
to
be
mentioned
in
the
large
second
tier
of
pumpkin
beers
falling
a
bit
short
of
world
class
status
but
is
still
better
than
many
of
the
other
offerings
out
there
overall
i
give
points
for
originality
since
i
cant
think
of
any
other
pumpkin
oktoberfests
not
really
worth
a
six
pack
or
case
but
a
good
beer
regardless
a
few
frills
aside
this
is
a
plainydecent
and
wellspiced
pumpkin
lager
cant
say
that
ive
had
a
pumpkin
lager
before
i
get
the
mashup
of
styles
between
pumpkin
beer
and
oktoberfest
but
its
a
spiced
lager
with
a
lot
of
seasonal
flair
and
some
pumpkin
meat
awarding
a
higher
rating
as
a
promising
pumpkin
beer
ok
not
must
have
overall
one
of
the
few
pumpkins
i
can
actually
stomach
this
time
of
the
year
and
my
go
to
overall
this
was
pretty
nice
would
be
good
after
a
heaping
plate
of
turkey
and
dressing
o
a
delicious
seasonal
beer
an
interesting
blend
of
pumpkin
ale
and
oktoberfest
styles
terrapin
absolutely
nailed
the
level
of
spice
for
my
taste
i
dont
know
exactly
what
this
beer
is
but
i
dont
care
ill
definitely
have
again
pours
a
fairly
clear
copper
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
definitely
a
strong
pie
spice
aroma
to
this
lots
of
nutmeg
and
all
spice
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
vanilla
a
nice
malty
sweetness
too
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
to
it
with
a
solid
but
not
overdone
pie
spice
flavor
good
nutmeg
all
spice
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
too
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
o
nice
cinnamon
character
but
the
vinegar
note
really
throws
things
off
and
the
profile
is
relatively
light
on
the
pumpkin
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
head
mostly
because
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
single
sitting
all
of
the
positives
of
a
pumpkin
beer
and
none
of
the
negatives
of
an
overly
sweet
beer
this
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
but
tastes
like
a
wellbalanced
and
perfectly
spiced
pumpkin
beer
would
definitely
drink
again
o
at
least
as
good
as
other
pumpkins
ive
had
lighter
than
desired
as
most
but
overall
a
good
spice
filled
beer
im
pretty
sure
this
is
the
first
pumpkin
lager
ive
had
it
is
light
and
nicely
refreshing
but
the
spices
are
just
a
touch
off
for
my
taste
still
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
ive
had
this
year
pours
a
nice
amber
almost
pumpkin
colored
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
pumpkin
beer
smelled
more
like
a
belgian
wit
to
me
with
a
touch
of
nutmeg
to
me
it
tasted
like
a
belgian
wit
with
a
saisonpumpkin
mouthfeel
not
sure
that
i
am
describing
it
well
but
i
definitely
got
a
soft
mouthfeel
from
the
pumpkin
but
the
spices
were
on
the
dry
side
for
your
typical
pumpkin
beer
i
was
going
to
say
that
it
almost
reminded
me
of
a
lager
in
terms
of
the
mouthfeel
and
then
i
read
the
bottle
and
saw
that
it
is
a
hybrid
of
a
pumpkin
beer
and
a
märzen
overall
it
is
an
interesting
brew
not
what
i
was
expecting
going
in
and
it
definitely
doesnt
fit
the
typical
pumpkin
beer
genre
but
an
enjoyable
brew
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
beer
and
while
not
bad
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
depth
overall
a
decent
beer
from
a
great
brewery
may
2013
update
drinking
a
9
month
old
2012
which
is
if
anything
better
overall
just
alright
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
doesnt
really
go
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
o
pretty
solid
for
what
it
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
and
one
i
would
pick
up
again
skal
o
interesting
mix
of
beers
here
i
liked
the
back
end
better
then
the
front
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
pumpkin
at
front
and
the
heavy
spice
presence
overshadowed
it
a
bit
overall
though
this
is
a
solid
good
tasting
brew
oas
far
as
tastes
go
this
is
awesome
however
i
do
have
a
big
complaint
11
for
a
bomber
seriously
now
this
beer
was
sitting
between
a
ccb
good
gourd
and
a
southern
tier
pumking
both
being
much
cheaper
than
this
the
only
reason
i
picked
this
up
was
because
ive
never
had
it
before
i
realize
its
supposed
to
be
different
from
those
but
lets
face
it
this
is
just
another
pumpkin
beer
as
long
as
the
price
stays
i
promise
ill
never
buy
this
again
if
it
were
to
come
in
6packs
for
the
same
price
then
yes
id
definitely
pick
up
one
of
those
it
it
a
great
and
unique
beer
but
for
the
price
id
rather
mix
some
pumking
with
my
favorite
german
oktoberfests
pours
out
amber
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
active
carbonation
visible
lots
of
pumpkin
and
spice
in
the
nose
mixed
in
with
cinnamon
and
stewed
vegetables
noticeable
bitterness
about
halfway
through
the
sip
good
lager
character
to
it
again
cinnamon
shines
through
in
the
taste
along
with
some
pumpkin
and
a
hefty
blend
of
spices
pretty
much
smells
like
it
tastes
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
has
a
nice
moderate
mouthfeel
to
it
and
is
extremely
smooth
overall
id
prefer
this
pumpkinlager
to
a
pumpkin
ale
any
day
serving
type
bottle
d
a
pumpkin
spiked
oktoberfest
hard
to
disagree
with
such
an
idea
this
may
be
my
definitive
fall
beer
from
here
on
out
o
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
not
the
best
i
love
the
smell
but
the
taste
is
lacking
o
overall
exactly
as
advertised
although
this
is
a
pumpkin
beer
it
is
a
lager
certainly
not
an
in
your
face
pumpkin
beer
more
beery
than
most
pumpkin
beers
and
overall
pretty
good
o
in
top
3
favorites
with
schlafly
and
pumking
so
far
but
i
have
a
ways
to
go
with
greater
pumpkin
treat
and
double
pumpkin
all
waiting
to
be
drank
nothing
was
overpowering
or
unbalanced
cant
wait
to
relax
and
drink
this
more
this
fall
o
a
good
beer
that
is
a
nice
combination
between
the
marzen
and
pumpkin
ale
styles
it
doesnt
overwhelm
with
pumpkin
spices
and
finishes
clean
and
dry
like
a
marzen
did
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
last
years
side
project
8
thanks
to
jimmy
definately
different
but
both
good
in
their
own
rights
o
a
solid
pumpkin
brew
it
needs
more
flavor
to
it
though
perhaps
some
more
pumpkin
andor
spices
o
this
was
a
nice
surprise
its
not
far
from
my
favorite
example
good
gourd
and
had
some
nice
flavors
it
was
particularly
good
as
it
warmed
id
be
happy
to
buy
a
6pk
when
i
see
it
next
had
a
six
pack
over
the
weekend
and
found
it
to
worthy
of
the
ten
dollar
price
tag
nice
amber
appearance
and
good
head
i
found
the
nose
to
be
excellent
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
spice
each
one
tasted
better
than
the
one
before
would
highly
recommend
theres
no
hint
of
the
lager
yeast
in
this
one
so
its
surprising
that
this
is
a
pumpkin
lager
and
not
a
pumpkin
ale
pretty
good
all
around
it
needs
more
of
either
spice
or
pumpkin
to
make
it
great
but
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
and
one
that
i
will
gladly
drink
this
was
the
hardest
review
ive
done
because
its
so
damn
hot
and
cold
some
drinks
are
world
class
some
drinks
are
failures
inconsistencies
really
ruined
this
one
for
me
d
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
so
far
this
year
it
is
not
dominant
on
either
pumpkin
pie
or
pumpkin
spices
which
i
can
appreciate
i
feel
like
dogfish
head
is
more
like
eating
pie
and
southern
tiers
is
more
like
warming
spices
which
both
are
good
in
their
own
regard
but
pumpkinfest
is
a
great
balance
between
the
two
by
far
my
favorite
lager
ive
ever
had
i
love
terrapin
overall
i
was
extremely
impressed
they
did
a
great
job
and
i
will
continue
to
buy
and
enjoy
this
beer
cheers
o
a
unique
blend
of
pumpkin
and
octoberfest
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
o
an
excellent
fall
beer
a
mash
up
of
an
octoberfest
beer
with
pumpkin
nice
spice
flavors
with
pumpkin
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
the
head
is
a
little
fizzy
and
tan
in
color
the
lacing
is
minimal
for
sure
the
spices
on
the
nose
scream
autumn
loud
and
clear
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
balanced
nicely
between
the
spicy
pumpkin
flavor
to
the
beer
hidden
inside
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
good
charge
of
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
pumpkin
ale
and
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
one
day
d
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
here
definitely
full
of
spice
and
a
huge
nose
i
think
the
nutmeg
was
just
a
tad
bit
too
much
but
this
was
still
excellent
i
would
gladly
drink

im
not

pumpkin
beers
in

this
does
nothing
to
change

opinion
this
needs
more

more
sweetness

less

very
enjoyable
but
it
tastes
like
a
regular
pumpkin
beer
to
me
i
dont
really
get
any
of
the
oktoberfest
characteristics
from
the
beer

than
the
caramel
and

which
are
typically
present
in

beers

i
know
this
isnt
in
the
pumpkin
beer
category

i
still
consider
it
to
be
one
not
my
favorite
and
i
think
there
are
better
ones
out
there
needs
to
pull
back
from
the
spices
a
bit
and
i
think
it
would
be
a

better

overall
a
nice
and
interesting
brew
for
the
holiday
season
d
after
reading
the
lable
i
was
wondering
how
this
was
going
to
work
out
and
to
my
surprise
i
think
it
turned
out
pretty
well
i
was
able
to
pick
out
each
part
of
the
beer
and
it
wasnt
overly
spiced
or
overly
sweet
a
nice
beer
that
you
should
try
and
determine
whether
you
like
the
premise
or
not
pours
a
clean
deep
amber

orangeish
color
with
a
light
tan

the
aroma
sweet
pumpkin
and
spice
almost
creamy
in
the
taste
spicy
hints
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
more
flavor
at
the
end
than
in
the
beginning
a
spice
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
small
dry
cinnamon
and
spice
in
the
aftertaste
by
far
one
of
the
top
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
had
extremely
well
balanced
throughout
and
very
tasty
with
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
leading
the
malt
and
tiny
hop
bite
along
by
the
nose
not
too
thick
on
the
tongue
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
one
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
d
not
bad
far
more
spicier
than
what
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
the
bitterness
started
to
really
bother
me
d
decent
beer
but
one
of
my
least
favorite
pumpkins
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
pumpkin
pie
with
a
decent
amount
of
both
pumpkin
and
spices
but
also
a
sweet
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
bitter
and
spicy
finish
not
unlike
pepper
and
cinnamon
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
had
a
bottle
from
abes
cold
beer
i
like
this
one
there
was
a
lot
more
natural
pumpkin
flavor
and
less
spice
dominance
that
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
have
it
tasted
like
i
was
eating
pumpkin
or
some
other
squash
not
just
drinking
pumpkin
pie
spice
beer
it
was
backed
up
with
a
toasty
chocolate
barley
character
making
a
cocoa
pumpkin
taste
its
great
to
find
a
fresh
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
that
also
happens
to
be
delicious
check
this
one
out
d
an
interesting
hybrid
of
oktoberfest
and
pumpkin
ale
this
6
1
abv
fall
amalgamation
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
it
takes
the
best
of
two
great
seasonal
styles
the
smooth
malty
drinkability
of
a
marzen
and
the
spicy
roasted
sweetness
of
a
pumpkin
ale
and
levels
the
difference
out
id
certainly
try
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
average
beer
nothing
too
earthshattering
but
a
nice
fall
seasonal
for
sure
drinkability
decent
pumpkin
beer
that
hits
the
mark
for
the
style
easy
drinking
worthy
of
a
try
pours
orange
copper
with
a
nice
off
white
head
good
deal
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
is
nice
and
definitely
quite
interesting
can
definitely
understand
the
concept
undertones
of
pumpkin
and
squash
with
a
bit
of
bread
and
some
slight
sweetness
the
taste
is
pumpkin
bread
squash
and
a
bit
of
caramel
nice
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
drinks
fairly
well
and
definitely
a
unique
concept
deasy
drinking
pumpkin
brew
good
to
start
some
friends
out
on
who
normally
drink
busch
light
d
the
blend
is
good
save
for
the
lack
of
pumpkin
carryover
into
the
flavor
the
nose
is
predominantly
pumpkin
while
the
flavor
is
oktoberfest
the
should
marry
the
two
with
a
better
blend
to
become
one
great
superbeer
lakefronts
pumpkin
lager
is
a
far
superior
pumpkin
lager
this
has
a
few
adjustments
to
go
before
it
gets
to
the
next
level
but
its
certainly
drinkable
asis
d
id
bring
this
as
an
example
of
where
pumpkin
beers
should
start
and
where
they
can
go
from
sure
it
is
decent
but
would
i
want
this
over
other
offerings
probably
not
again
still
nice
one
to
tick
off
and
try
against
pumpkin
ales
however
where
the
spices
are
expected
this
one
sits
at
the
low
end
of
the
center
of
the
mediocre
pulp
that
dominates
the
field
in
this
style
it
would
get
about
a
2
5
as
well
being
a
pumpkin
ale
enthusiast
there
are
a
dozen
other
beers
i
would
recommend
before
this
one
d
goes
down
easy
d
this
is
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
until
i
find
something
i
love
i
think
this
style
just
isnt
for
me
ive
heard
the
weyerbacher
and
hoppin
frog
imperial
pumpkins
are
both
good
so
ill
try
to
get
those
and
review
before
the
season
is
over
d
this
is
a
perfect
blend
of
pumpkin
ale
and
marzen
bravo
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
sourdough
lingering
with
effervescent
carbonation
tickling
the
palate
this
is
one
of
the
thicker
marzens
ive
had
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
the
heft
of
the
body
suits
the
vegetal
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
a
lowish
abv
and
refreshing
lager
sensibility
make
for
a
nice
fall
session
candidate
probably
too
drinkable
drinkability
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
dogfish
head
is
still
the
champ
on
that
one
but
definitely
much
better
than
most
ive
had
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
sitting
on
the
porch
as
the
leaves
fall
a
very
nice
mix
of
two
great
fall
styles
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
many
better
brews
in
the
style
ahem

ahem

ahem
not
the
first
to
hunt
down
for
the
style
many
better
unbiased
brews
to
try
prior
to
this
one
all
in
all
im
disappointed
the
sweetness
is
nearly
nonexistent
the
spices
are
downplayed
and
it
just
doesnt
seem
done
well
for
style
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
the
spice
flavor
is
spot
on
this
brew
is
gonna
be
hard
to
beat
very
drinkable
the
flavor
honors
the
oktoberfest
base
with
a
crisp
nutty
malt
presence
solid
backing
of
aforementioned
spices
dont
overwhelm
the
palate
but
definitely
accentuate
the
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
spoton
crisp
mediumthin
body
with
a
tightly
packed
carbonation
level
that
complements
the
spice
levels
to
a
t
overall
partly
because
the
flavors
are
overall
lacking
in
complexity
or
strength
disappointing
flavor
after
a
very
good
aroma

with

the
effort
here
by
terrapin
to
try
for
a
mix
of
two
different
fall
favorites
with
cinnamon
still
the
dominant
spice
flavor
theres
also
quite
a
bit
of

here
and
im
thinking
pumpkin
theres
a
flavor
in
here
that
is
a
bit
rich
maybe
slightly
starchy
full

most
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
have
lots
of
pumpkin
spice
but
not
much
pumpkin
i
think
what
is

here
is
the
extra

a

but
it

5very
good
pumpkin
beer
by
terrapin
got
this
one
on
my
first
trip
to
charleston
beer
exchange
i
saw
they
had
it
on
draught
and
immediately
got
it
they
nailed
this
one
pretty
good
apperance
was
ok
but
this
is
what
i
have
been
waiting
for
most
pumpkin
beers
are
too
spicy
and
hoppy
for
me
was
a
nice
amalgam
of
a
pumpkin
beer
and
a
wholesomely
bready
oktoberfest
minus
a
few
ounces
portioned
out
to
roommate
chuck
and
maybe
the
best
pumpkin
i
have
thought
about
someone
combining
these
fall
favorites
together
and
im
glad
terrapin
did

pretty
good
summer
beer
just
the
right
amount
of
tangerine
much
better
than
most
fruit
beers
id
take
this
over
blue
moon
any
day
purchased
at
bevmo
manhattan
beach
worth
a
try
as
most
beers
are
im
a
sucker
for
citrusy
beers
nice
summertime
beer
not
filling
nice
tangerine
finish
and
i
like
citrus
this
is
my
wifes
favorite
beer
and
she
hates
beer
i
have
to
keep
it
in
the
fridge
so
for
those
who
are
not
looking
for
a
hoppy
sour
palate
destroying
taste
this
is
the
beer
for
you
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
cap
a
burst
of
tangerine
smell
hits
you
and
then
when
you
are
finished
the
taste
lingers
like
a
wheat
biscuit
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
good
summer
beer
good
summer
beer
like
a
belgian
white
but
tastier
beer
and
a
mimosa
i
am
sold
too
much
tangerine
but
enough
beer
when
i
rate
a
beer
i
try
to
be
objective
even
if
i
dont
particularly
appreciate
a
certain
style
i
try
to
rate
it
according
to
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
have
tried
i
have
been
to
lost
coast
brewery
and
it
was
a
great
experience
however
tangerine
wheat
was
anything
but
great
i
hope
it
was
an
old
bottle
or
my
glass
was
used
to
clean
a
toilet
it
was
very
very
orangey
but
after
about
a
second
i
had
to
force
a
swallow
and
drain
pour
the
rest
ill
try
it
one
more
time
and
see
but
as
of
this
review
avoid
disgusting
too
sweet
at
the
start
bitterness
a
little
bit
unpleasant
loved
this
beer
nice
tangerine
flavor
without
being
too
strong
very
refreshing
overall
a
solid
4
5
for
tangerine
wheat
lost
coast
brewery
and
cafe
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
nonartificiality
of
the
tangerine
flavor
really
not
impressed
too
big
on
the
fruit
character
loses
the
hops
and
malt
in
the
sweetness
a
little
metallic
as
well
overall

would
i
drink
this
again
dude
sign
me
up
to
buy
cases
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
all
around
the
smell
blew
me
away
and
the
taste
did
little
to
sway
that
opinion
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
and
what
else
is
left
the

the

is

a

mixed
with

very

brew
o
a

a

too
sweet
high
grade
wine
cooler
substitute
still
tasty
and
refreshing
o
i
would
not
be
so
quick
to
buy
this
next
time
but
it
was
not
bad
it
was
worth
a
try
i
will
say
it
was
not
among
my
favorites
but
i
have
had
others
i
liked
less
in
short
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
are
looking
for
something
on
a
warm
pleasant
day
easily
seduced
by
the
ripe
orange
flavor
any
notion
of
ale
are
easy
to
dismiss
but
in
the
end
the
beer
is
grainysweet
to
a
fault
and
its
orange
taste
becomes
way
too
dominant
not
allowing
the
classic
alelike
taste
to
become
part
of
its
story
o
its
ok
i
would
drink
it
if
it
were
offered
to
me
this
would
make
a
decent
beer
for
all
day
drinking
i
believe
this
to
be
a
beer
that
is
suited
to
taste
if
you
are
a
fan
of
beers
with
strong
tangerines
and
apricot
sweetness
than
this
is
up
your
alley
overall
not
a
winner
i
would
rather
just
have
a
tangerine
overall
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
on
a
hot
summer
evening
which
it
is
right
now
i
think
you
could
do
better
with
a
decent
wheat
beer
and
squeeze
an
orange
wedge
or
half
a
tangerine
into
the
beer
smelled
orange
tangerine
pulp
orange

maybe
some

can
almost
taste
a

with
some

a

with
so

d
not

bad
for
what
it

any
means
pours

with

then
a

with

mouthfeel
is
good
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
you
can
tell
you
are
drinking
a
wheat
beer
even
with
the
tons
of
citrus
flavor
o
started
refreshingly
interesting
but
the
tangerine
is
too
much
if
this
beer
were
a
bit
mellower
and
had
a
little
hop
bitterness
to
counter
the
tangerine
it
could
really
work
works
great
for
an
easy
drinking
summer
time
refresher
overall
while
it
starts
off
well
enough
the
tangerine
carries
too
much
into
the
finish
leaving
an
overpowering
sensation
on
the
palate
a
near
headache
inducing
experience
after
one
beer
i
once
bought
a
sixer
several
years
ago
when
it
first
hit
the
scene
i
couldnt
get
through
two
before
i
gave
the
rest
of
the
sixer
away
i
swore
id
never
try
this
beer
again
but
once
i
began
to
review
beers
i
knew
id
have
to
give
it
one
more
round
before
putting
it
to
rest
forever
its
a
shame
this
could
be
a
great
beer
if
it
were
toned
down
and
given
considerably
better
balance
as
it
is
its
awful
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
dont
buy
this
beer
i
really
cant
help
but
wonder
if
this
beer
really
has
tang
in
it
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
must
try
if
you
like
tangerine
otherwise
would
not
recommended
this
seems
like
it
would
be
better
paired
for
a
hot
summer
day
by
the
pool
or
just
after
finishing
up
the
yard
work
on
a
90
degree
day
it
could
be
good
but
unfortunately
the
tangerine
flavor
is
a
bit
too
artificial
in
character
screw
the
haters
on
this
one
this
beer
kicks
ass
whether
you
like
fruit
beers
or
not
you
have
to
respect
this
one
so
much
flavor
the
pour
is
a
relatively
standard
looking
pale
wheat
color
with
a
lacey
but
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
epic
so
much
tangerine
right
from
the
tree
its
acidic
and
sweet
tangy
and
robust
its
juicy
and
alive
all
at
once
its
fantastic
and
it
crowds
out
any
heavy
vibes
from
the
wheat
malt
in
both
taste
and
smell
all
those
aromas
carry
through
to
the
flavor
which
is
equally
orangey
and
refreshing
there
is
no
other
brew
out
there
this
heavy
on
the
tangerine
citrus
element
its
uncanny
really
more
than
enough
carbonation
made
a
little
heavy
from
the
left
over
yeast
but
to
me
this
is
inconsequential
as
the
tangerine
notes
make
this
beer
as
light
as
can
be
a
perfect
spring
break
lounge
chair
sipper
winter
transformer
or
everyday
slammer
i
absolutely
adored
this
beer
and
im
sorry
to
see
it
rated
so
low
i
think
its
a
rare
thing
in
the
beer
world
to
encounter
a
brew
with
so
much
fruit
character
that
isnt
sweet
or
fake
this
is
really
lovely
dont
let
the
ratings
throw
you
off
taste
throws
out
some
competing
flavors
i
dont
like
how
the
malty
sweetness
plays
against
the
sharp
obvious
tangerine
citrus
it
lacks
flow
and
the
pithy
character
comes
out
too
much
i
dont
like
the
syrupy
wheatmalt
flavors
and
think
this
would
come
across
better
with
a
lighter
malt
and
an
uplifting
bubbly
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
and
a
touch
cloying
i
am
a
sucker
for
fruit
beers
so
i
will
finish
this
12
oz
sample
but
i
definitely
wont
look
for
this
one
again
tastes
similar
to
the
aroma
like
slightly
carbonated
soap
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
citrus
at
the
finish
definitely
not
impressive
overall
if
you
searching
for
hopps
and
malts
you
will
be
disapointed
in
this
brew
however
evaluating
the
beer
for
what
it
is
fruit
beer
i
think
it
hit
its
mark
quite
well
this
beer
is
well
crafted
and
is
defiinatley
an
above
average
fruit
beer
the
beer
needed
a
thicker
head
with
more
lacing
on
the
glass
and
lacked
complexity
to
be
considered
a
nop
notch
beer
this
beer
would
be
an
excellant
picnic
beer
or
hot
wheater
beer
it
would
also
be
an
excellant
entry
level
beer
for
someone
new
to
craft
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
it
is
definatley
interesting
and
worth
checking
out
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
at
a
relatively
new
bar
nearby
my
house
at
first
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
it
has
a
very
strong
tangerine
smell
to
it
the
first
few
sips
were
ok
but
the
more
i
drank
through
my
pint
the
more
and
more
it
started
to
taste
like
tang
the
tangerine
is
way
too
strong
in
this
beer
without
any
other
flavors
to
complement
it
it
honestly
didnt
taste
like
a
wheat
beer
let
alone
a
beer
at
all
unfortunately
it
was
a
disappointment
fizzy
like
club
soda
with
a
feel
similar
to
it
as
well
fairly
clean
finish
though
dry
and
bitter
a
decent
beer
overall
but
needs
a
better
less
bitter
finish
and
some
wheat
notes
would
be
good
too
but
this
beer
to
me
is
hardly
palatable
it
is
thin
watery
and
sweet
dry
from
the
tangerine
it
tastes
like
a
yucky
soda
overall
it
reminded
me
too
much
of
a
orange
soda
to
really
be
a
beer
i
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
beer
that
tasted
quite
like
this
one
so
that
made
it
worthwhile
to
try
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
overall
a
very
fruity
tasting
brew
with
a
thin
watery
feel
would
be
great
when
you
feel
overheated
and
want
to
chug
a
few
o
it
reminds
me
of
blue
moon
with
an
orange
slice
but
without
that
cardboard
taste
that
blue
moon
seems
to
have
i
was
actually
in
the
mood
for
a
wheat
beer
this
particular
day
served
in
a
ribbed
tumbler
a
hazy
burnt
sienna
color
with
a
wispy
white
head
no
real
retention
or
lacing
to
speak
of
obvious
whole
tangerine
peel
in
the
nose
with
a
zesty
wheat
profile
delivers
what
it
promises
in
the
taste
bready
wheat
malts
tangerine
and
more
tangerine
from
the
pulp
to
the
peel
mild
pithy
bitterness
in
the
finish
lightmedium
body
a
bit
chewy
and
moderately
refreshing
no
surprises
here
not
too
bad
overall
drinkability
goes
down
way
too
easy
poured
from
the
bottle
the
beer
appears
a
hazy
orangeish
with
a
microscopic
white
head
the
nose
is
a
potent
orange
soda
slap
in
the
face
with
a
hint
of
beer
brings
me
back
to
my
keenan
and
kel
days
unfortunately
it
tastes
exactly
like
orange
soda
as
well
god
awful
beer
with
no
redeeming
qualities
the
artificial
orange
candy
flavor
and
extreme
effervescence
is
way
too
overpowering
to
say
that
the
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
brings
balance
to
the
beverage
although
i
cant
detect
an
abv
at
all
making
it
quite
drinkable
for
a
mixed
drink
i
will
never
drink
this
beer
again
o
not
a
very
good
beer
reminded
me
of
a
weak
tangerine
cough
syrup
it
was
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
but
i
did
it
never
again
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
nice
to
try
something
different
after
about
10
minutes
the
foam
and
lacing
was
completely
gone
but
i
cant
say
it
had
a
negative
effect
on
the
flavor
you
probably
shouldnt
to
drink
this
beer
if
you
have
acid
reflux
its
quite
acidic
im
finding
this
out
afterward
lol
i
wanted
to
like
the
beer
i
love
the
smell
i
love
orange
in
my
alcohol
i
just
couldnt
get
past
it
the
strong
tangerine
flavor
combined
with
this
brew
is
how
a
wheat
beer
should
be
forget
adding
the
orange
to
blue
moon
this
is
the
beer
you
want
o
okay
brew
the
tangerine
taste
seems
a
bit
forced
is
a
refreshing
finish
o
lives
up
to
its
name
tangerine
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
this
with
food
cause
it
does
ride
the
palate
a
fair
bit
but
its
definitely
a
good
kind
of
kick
back
and
knock
one
down
kind
of
drink
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
12
inch
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
drip
back
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
a
mix
of
tangerines
and
oranges
with
some
slight
grain
aromas
taste
is
of
intense
tangerine
up
front
fruit
and
zest
with
a
wheat
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
that
delivers
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
beige
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
tangerines
some
wheat
taste
is
tart
lots
of
tangerine
a
touch
of
wheat
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
o
decent
fruit
beer
would
only
get
it
whilst
in
the
mood
a
more
than
reasonable
offering
from
the
fruit
beer
category
while
i
prefer
the
essence
and
balance
of
something
like
hangar
24s
orange
wheat
tangerine
wheat
is
a
little
bit
of
a
breakup
from
the
usual
orange
flavored
wheat
ale
i
mean
if
your
in
the
mood
for
something
unusual
try
it
or
if
you
cant
get
those
pesky
stains
off
your
liver
try
it
d
very
drinkable
this
would
be
great
on
the
beach
overall
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
feel
it
was
more
tangerine
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
surprisingly
liked
it
overall
a
nice
summer
beer
dr
very
drinkable
but
lacking
complexity
or
inspiration
id
have
it
again
at
a
lower
price
onot
a
good
fruit
beer
whatsoever
very
poor
beer
could
not
even
finish
it
overall
as
soft
drink
it
would
be
ok
as
a
beer
it
is
less
than
ok
very
disappointing
and
difficult
to
finish
o
i
like
fruit
beers
for
the
most
part
perhaps
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
sincerely
doubt
it
overall
couldnt
hack
the
memories
of
childrens
aspirin
that
this
beer
brought
back
for
me
drain
pour
overall
bascially
alcoholic
flat
fanta
it
was
good
but
not
what
i
want
from
my
beer
the
tangerine
wheat
from
lost
coast
is
very
good
if
your
hanging
with
some
hotties
and
want
them
to
try
a
good
fruit
style
beer
this
is
it
the
appearance
i
thought
was
lacking
the
color
was
a
cloudy
burnt
yellow
color
the
was
zero
head
present
and
no
lacing
the
smell
was
amazing
like
an
orange
life
savor
very
good
the
taste
had
a
big
orangetangerine
taste
with
hints
of
spices
this
could
be
compared
to
a
blue
moon
with
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
great
summer
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
hue
which
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
a
very
little
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
basically
one
of
the
most
strongest
fruit
inspired
wheat
beers
ive
ever
sampled
and
has
aromas
of
very
strong
tangerine
a
touch
like
sunkist
and
with
a
twist
of
candied
wheatthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
very
similar
to
sunkist
with
its
high
carbonation
and
the
only
tastes
i
can
phathom
from
this
brew
are
obviously
tangerinecandied
wheat
and
fruit
punch
and
overall
the
tangerine
is
way
too
overpowering
and
doesnt
let
any
other
flavours
shine
and
i
would
not
buy
again
it
almost
reminds
me
of
sunkist
mixed
with
vodka
cheers
is
what
it
is
and
does
what
it
does
probably
be
very
enjoyable
in
peak
summer
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
that
went
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
the
beer
smells
mostly
like
tangerines
along
with
a
little
bit
of
wheat
it
tastes
kinda
like
a
watered
down
sugar
substitute
tangerinecitrusy
soda
would
taste
not
awful
but
not
exactly
good
either
mouthfeelbody
is
light
it
has
good
carbonation
and
its
not
hard
to
drink
overall
i
cant
say
im
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
i
like
the
aroma
but
thats
about
the
only
thing
i
like
a
lot
about
this
brew
with
that
being
said
id
still
try
this
again
in
the
future
just
as
long
as
i
was
only
buying
a
single
bottle
and
not
a
6
pack
ive
had
worse
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
that
anyone
buy
more
than
a
single
bottle
of
this
at
a
time
its
drinkable
but
just
barely
o
a
very
drinkable
wheat
ale
with
fruit
but
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
overall
a
good
beer
and
highly
recommended
for
those
looking
to
try
something
different
and
specially
to
all
the
tangerine
lovers
this
is
just
like
a
glass
of
sunkist
only
with
a
touch
less
sugar
for
me
it
is
over
the
top
on
the
fruit
flavour
and
it
lacks
any
sense
of
finesse
o
good
beer
but
it
felt
like
it
was
lacking
not
sure
what
its
missing
bit
something
feels
off
it
wasnt
bad
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
ill
definitely
try
another
brew
from
them
again
though
we
first
must
say
we
are
usually
drinking
stouts
or
porters
in
addition
from
experience
most
beers
claiming
tangerine
flavortaste
were
disappointing
that
is
not
the
case
with
this
beer
right
from
the
start
this
beer
has
a
strong
tangerine
aroma
on
the
nose
a
nice
clean
white
ivory
head
implies
the
carbonation
that
is
in
this
beer
this
beer
also
has
a
slight
thickness
that
is
unexpected
the
flavor
of
tangerine
also
comes
out
in
the
taste
with
only
an
extremely
slight
bitterness
but
an
effervescence
that
clears
out
the
bitterness
leaving
the
orangey
taste
a
really
great
summer
beer
pours
a
clean
orangishyellow
with
carbonation
bubbles
coming
to
the
top
nose
is
wheat
and
fruit
the
tangerine
comes
through
nicely
taste
is
malt
and
wheat
with
the
tangerine
present
but
not
overpowering
or
oversweet
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
very
carbonated
rather
refreshing
overall
i
enjoyed
it
at
the
pool
while
on
vacation
in
ca
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
when
i
poured
this
brew
into
a
glass
i
noticed
how
orange
it
looked
in
the
glass
i
could
definitely
smell
the
tangerine
it
smell
was
a
little
strong
for
my
liking
the
head
on
my
beer
was
quickly
gone
the
taste
for
me
was
that
of
a
nice
smooth
beer
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
you
could
have
after
a
hard
day
at
work
or
mowing
the
lawn
and
you
want
something
refreshing
that
would
not
fill
you
up
if
i
had
to
pick
a
food
to
go
with
it
i
would
have
this
brew
with
finger
foods
or
a
vegetable
plate
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
brew
that
you
would
have
as
an
appetizer
before
you
drank
a
heavier
beer
with
a
meal
overall
not
a
good
beer
on
any
level
but
the
smell
so
if
you
wanna
spend
money
to
sit
around
and
smell
a
beer
then
this
one
is
for
your
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
pleasant
refreshing
beverage
that
seems
more
like
a
fruit
soda
than
a
beer
it
offers
the
prospect
of
a
refreshing
cooler
on
a
hot
humid
summers
day
and
that
is
probably
when
i
i
might
be
willing
to
have
another
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
bit
better
than
some
of
the
fruitwheat
beers
ive
tried
and
the
wheattangerine
makes
a
good
combination
but
it
is
a
bit
too
much
like
a
soda
to
suit
my
tastes
o
not
something
i
could
enjoy
on
a
daily
basis
however
one
would
be
quenching
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
etc
poured
out
as
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
it
the
beer
doesnt
have
much
lacing
the
smell
is
heavy
with
tangerine
with
light
aromas
of
wheat
the
taste
is
very
strong
with
tangerine
it
almost
tastes
like
perfume
or
something
its
a
little
too
strong
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
those
days
when
its
hot
out
overall
its
not
bad
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
potent
side
hazy
orange
in
body
with
light
bubbly
white
fruity
aroma
of
tangerine
dandelion
cream
soda
tastes
of
light
tangerine
wheat
slight
yeast
character
floral
notes
an
underlying
dry
hop
character
is
quite
refreshing
as
well
tangerine
lingers
on
the
palate
in
the
aftertaste
light
body
with
some
fizzy
carbonation
much
better
than
expected
refreshing
and
balanced
for
a
fruit
focused
beer
it
doesnt
go
over
the
top
in
its
tangerine
direction
saw
this
at
by
the
bottle
in
vancouver
and
said
summer
is
upon
us
time
for
wheat
beers
cracked
it
open
after
work
today
and
so
far
i
am
pleased
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
some
visible
carbonation
head
is
about
12
inch
tall
in
my
imperial
pint
glass
and
it
fades
quickly
eventually
it
recedes
to
a
ring
around
my
glass
and
a
slight
bit
of
film
over
the
top
of
my
beer
when
i
smell
it
the
first
thing
i
get
i
tangerines
sort
of
an
orange
candy
sort
of
smell
as
i
taste
it
i
first
catch
the
wheat
but
the
tangerine
taste
takes
over
quickly
in
general
i
would
describe
the
taste
as
being
similar
to
an
orange
creamsicle
the
tangerine
taste
lingers
for
a
bit
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
much
of
an
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
i
think
that
gives
it
a
refreshing
feel
overall
this
beer
is
okay
on
a
summer
day
and
if
creamsicles
are
your
thing
then
this
is
right
up
your
alley
o
i
had
high
hopes
and
i
really
tried
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
the
medicinal
quality
of
it
really
ruined
it
for
me
o
im
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
when
its
done
right
this
one
was
intriguing
to
me
but
it
didnt
really
scratch
my
citrus
itch
i
dont
think
i
will
be
giving
this
one
a
round
two
d
this
is
a
very
strange
beer
with
some
over
the
top
tangerine
character
i
mean
i
expected
citrus
but
this
is
ridiculous
it
really
smells
like
a
piece
of
fruit
which
works
well
in
the
aroma
but
not
so
much
flavor
wise
it
has
a
weird
orange
soda
aftertaste
that
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
not
a
drain
pour
but
really
not
good
o
too
sweet
for
me
and
lacks
balance
granted
its
a
fruit
beer
but
for
such
low
abv
and
like
the
fruit
it
should
be
refreshing
lighter
even
crisper
id
pass
on
this
again
glad
i
split
this
bottle
overall
wow
i
expected
more
from
a
california
brewery
but
this
beer
is
crap
i
can
forgive
extra
sweet
beers
but
when
the
beer
has
no
quality
other
than
tangerine
flavored
water
i
cant
help
but
bash
it
average
at
best
d
very
much
a
fruit
beer
trying
at
a
wheat
not
the
other
way
around
this
one
is
very
sweet
so
its
difficult
to
have
more
than
one
d
wouldnt
be
all
that
bad
if
the
texture
was
fixed
besides
that
though
its
quite
one
dimensional
drinkability
good
drinker
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
would
be
a
nice
on
a
hot
day
while
camping
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
good
retention
the
nose
smacks
of
orange
and
tangerine
like
tang
and
nothing
else
the
taste
is
all
oj
again
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
quite
dry
not
the
best
of
this
style
but
may
be
a
good
substitute
for
a
mimosa
at
brunch
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
with
a
smell
like
you
are
actually
peeling
a
tangerine
im
impressed
so
far
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
color
with
a
thick
foamy
dense
white
head
picture
perfect
for
a
wheat
as
i
said
before
it
smells
like
an
actual
peeled
tangerine
when
you
get
your
nose
deep
in
there
you
get
some
effervescent
versions
of
the
citrus
smells
and
the
constant
flow
of
bubbles
also
shows
a
high
level
of
carbonation
in
mouth
that
carbonation
makes
the
beer
a
bit
sharp
but
the
flavors
are
made
to
be
crisp
and
light
full
flavors
of
light
malt
oatcereal
and
a
surprisingly
light
citrus
highlight
with
the
nose
of
this
beer
i
was
almost
expecting
a
mouthful
of
orange
crush
but
the
citrus
aspect
was
a
nice
balance
rather
than
an
overpowering
ogre
the
beer
stays
light
and
crisp
throughout
drinking
with
a
minimal
citrus
aftertaste
on
an
extremely
quick
finish
this
beer
is
supereasy
to
drink
by
the
bucket
and
on
a
hot
day
i
would
absolutely
fill
a
cooler
with
this
brew
will
drink
again
notes
this
one
was
way
off
balance
and
too
light
on
the
palate
overall
i
was
just
not
impressed
with
this
beer
12oz
bottle
pous
hazy
yelloworange
with
white
head
very
little
carbonation
aroma
of
orangetangerinealmost
like
those
orange
jelly
candies
that
are
shaped
like
a
slice
of
orange
taste
is
sweet
but
the
first
sip
is
almost
like
an
orange
soda
with
the
fizziness
hitting
your
mouth
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
slick
texture
finish
has
a
bite
like
the
taste
of
the
peel
and
pith
of
the
citrus
interesting
its
refeshing
and
crisp
would
make
a
nice
summer
beer
big
thanks
to
gobzilla
for
sharing
this
one
upon
my
arrival
to
cali
served
from
bottle
into
a
firestone
walker
sampler
shaker
poured
a
hazy
yellow
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
tangerines
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tangerines
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
i
wasnt
really
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
tastes
like
a
fruit
drink
the
ones
without
all
the
added
sugars
this
might
be
okay
mixed
with
vodka
but
that
might
be
about
it
not
having
this
particular
fruit
though
its
not
all
that
different
from
navel
oranges
imho
as
part
of
my
diet
it
was
enjoyable
to
see
it
so
prominent
in
the
profile
of
this
wheat
beer
and
tasty
enough
at
that
if
youre
ok
with
such
brazen
simplicity
in
your
doctored
brews
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
in
color
with
pale
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
very
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
that
of
a
tangerine
jolly
rancher
candy
with
faint
wheat
notes
and
a
bit
of
underlying
bready
character
pretty
basic
aroma
the
tangerine
pretty
much
dominates
the
palate
with
lots
of
sweetness
some
mild
wheaty
accents
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
in
the
backgound
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
very
sweet
and
mild
bready
wheaty
finish
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
but
after
no
having
it
for
awhile
and
seriuosly
drinking
lots
of
craft
brew
i
have
definitely
out
grown
it
d
just
far
too
sweet
to
drink
any
significant
amount
of
like
drinking
melted
candy
d
great
substitute
for
orange
kool
aid
wife
enjoyed
it
great
fruity
beer
if
that
is
what
you
like
d
not
bad
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
refreshing
citrus
drink
lost
coasts
tangerine
wheat
poured
a
clear
orangecopper
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
minimal
to
no
retention
nothing
impressive
but
what
its
lacking
in
appearances
it
certainly
makes
up
for
in
nose
this
was
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
smell
if
only
because
it
was
pure
sweet
freshlypeeled
clementine
and
tangerines
a
nicely
sweetened
orange
citrus
juice
with
plenty
of
sugar
and
zero
bitterness
i
almost
want
to
say
it
reminded
me
of
some
sort
of
cleaning
agent
minus
the
hospital
smell
had
i
not
been
at
an
event
for
beer
tasting
there
is
no
way
i
would
have
known
this
was
a
beer
purely
by
smell
as
the
alcohol
was
nonexistent
in
the
nose
even
in
the
taste
it
was
like
an
offkilter
orange
soda
sipping
it
made
me
think
of
sucking
on
a
clementine
splashed
with
tangerine
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
quite
light
carbonation
that
kept
it
from
being
fizzy
it
ended
nice
and
clean
and
very
fresh
a
summery
fruity
drink
by
all
measures
d
i
usually
hate
fruit
beers
i
would
love
to
drink
this
after
a
long
bike
ride
its
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
said
it
isnt
too
beery
more
like
a
mixed
radler
very
unpleasant
beer
this
one
its
not
a
refreshing
fruit
beer
its
an
unfortunate
and
insipid
one
very
little
to
recommend
it
even
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
had
such
hi
hopes
for
this
one
too
what
a
shame
d
if
you
like
tang
this
is
a
great
beverage
if
you
want
a
beer
this
is
not
for
you
d
pretty
much
as
advertised
heaps
of
tangerine
flavour
but
i
think
the
beer
got
lost
in
the
shuffle
some
d
not
easy
drinking
unless
you
like
orange
soda
i
would
not
have
another
one
of
these
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
people
really
into
fruit
beers
but
i
could
live
my
whole
life
and
never
have
this
again
fitting
orangegold
color
the
light
head
dissipates
very
quickly
dominant
smell
of
sweet
citrustangerine
is
strong
and
pleasant
with
a
nice
wheat
backdrop
tangerine
flavor
is
lighter
in
taste
a
little
sweet
but
some
wheat
in
the
finish
to
balance
lots
of
carbonation
and
slightly
viscous
mouthfeel
make
it
somewhat
soda
like
a
pretty
good
fruity
beer
but
no
more
than
2
for
me
overalli
normally
hate
to
trash
a
beer
but
for
me
this
one
honestly
crashed
and
burned
not
at
all
a
good
mix
of
flavors
remember
you
cant
drink
all
day
if
you
dont
start
in
the
morning
d
a
little
drier
finish
and
some
more
carbonation
would
have
made
this
much
more
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
carbonation
refreshing
as
a
wit
should
be
drinkability
is
good
no
flaws
and
a
moderate
abv
make
this
sessionable
d
i
could
pound
this
all
day
in
the
sun
d
this
stuff
is
simply
amazing
a
tasty
summertime
beverage
and
this
one
would
be
perfect
as
a
hairofthedog
type
drink
after
a
night
of
drinking
the
orange
is
quite
dominant
but
theres
enough
wheatymalty
flavours
that
linger
to
remind
you
that
its
still
beer
i
wish
this
stuff
came
in
a
6pack
because
its
the
perfect
summertime
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
and
just
a
bit
of
laceing
aroma
is
of
sweet
tart
candy
body
is
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
tangerine
up
front
with
a
mix
of
sweet
tart
fruits
and
wheat
throughout
tart
finish
not
bad
if
you
like
this
style
cheers
drinkability
well
its
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
but
i
feel
like
the
tangerine
is
just
way
too
much
again
thats
what
they
advertise
but
this
is
basically
tangerine
cream
soda
that
happens
to
have
malt
and
alcohol
in
it
although
i
did
like
this
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
unless
you
need
a
citrus
blast
d
youd
have
to
be
the
judge
on
this
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
pretty
quick
because
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
and
it
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
but
i
would
not
have
a
few
of
these
just
for
the
heck
of
it
d
this
is
a
lot
better
than
some
of
the
other
artificial
fruit
beers
out
there
but
its
just
too
fake
in
the
end
for
me
d
youd
better
love
orangetangeringcitrus
fruit
otherwise
dont
bother
however
i
found
this
to
be
a
light
quaffable
wheat
beer
with
a
bold
citrus
character
thats
nice
for
warmweather
imbibing
brought
back
from
san
diego
by
my
wife
pours
a
light
apricot
color
with
a
nice
billowy
white
head
huge
citrus
aromas
or
orange
and
tangerine
a
decent
wheat
beer
with
big
tangerine
and
orange
flavors
a
pretty
decent
refreshing
beer
nice
for
a
spring
day
at
5
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
fruit
beer
i
could
drink
a
a
few
of
these
for
sure
imo
this
would
make
a
great
beer
around
christmas
i
hope
its
available
around
that
time
of
year
this
beer
is
really
in
a
category
of
its
own
amazing
drinkability
refreshing
and
zinging
with
carbonation
easy
to
drink
despite
its
problems
d
one
was
enough
and
although
it
was
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
d
one
of
the
most
refreshing
ales
ive
had
so
far
this
is
perfect
for
springsummer
on
the
beach
bbq
poolside
anywhere
in
the
sun
basically
this
beer
is
alot
more
intricate
in
flavor
and
aroma
than
beers
like
shocktop
or
blue
moon
imo
at
just
5
abv
you
dont
notice
any
alcohol
but
its
too
much
like
a
carbonated
soda
to
enjoy
too
many
of
these
at
a
sitting
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
going
to
polarize
some
people
would
like
it
and
it
could
be
approachable
for
the
uninitiated
beer
drinker
who
also
likes
fruit
flavors
the
base
beer
is
probably
pretty
good
but
the
tangerine
flavor
is
too
prominent
and
just
not
naturaltasting
enough
for
me
not
bad
but
also
not
my
thing
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
offered
on
a
hot
day
drinks
ok
here
definitely
not
the
girly
fruit
beer
you
give
your
girlfriend
a
bit
hazy
and
dark
yellow
in
color
beautiful
white
head
disappears
quickly
and
is
not
very
sticky
aroma
is
all
tangerine
actually
my
first
thought
was
orange
soda
the
second
one
was
organge
gum
regardless
i
do
not
find
aroma
particularly
inviting
for
a
beer
plus
its
just
too
strong
taste
is
disappointing
not
very
crisp
a
bit
sweet
orange
and
lemon
are
both
citrus
but
what
a
different
in
wheat
beer
actually
i
can
probably
go
for
an
orange
slice
in
my
beer
but
this
is
just
too
much
light
to
medium
body
drinkable
just
not
enjoyable
not
much
in
terms
of
aftertaste
just
lingering
orange
sweetness
drinkability
none
i
gave
this
another
try
but
honestly
with
the
insane
amounts
of
carbonation
lack
of
flavor
mouthfeel
etc
i
just
cant
justify
my
wasting
both
calories
and
my
taste
buds
on
this
when
i
have
a
fresh
pliny
sitting
in
the
refrigerator
i
think
i
may
try
another
new
beer
first
because
i
cant
even
get
past
half
a
glass
of
this
truly
a
sad
excuse
for
a
beer
and
i
will
avoid
at
all
costs
from
now
on
d
this
is
probably
a
great
beer
for
people
who
are
not
really
into
beer
and
like
soda
or
fruit
drinks
it
tastes
absolutely
disgusting
and
has
horrible
mouthfeel
would
never
do
it
again
the
brew
paired
very
well
with
the
steak
i
used
a
mild
seasoning
but
the
natural
flavors
of
the
steak
played
well
with
the
citrus
almost
like
a
marinade
this
was
a
very
fun
beer
as
far
as
wheats
go
mouthfeel
remarkably
consistent
for
a
fruit
beer
they
usuall
falter
down
the
stretch
drinkable
although
not
worth
7
a
6er
unless
its
for
your
old
lady
and
shes
hot
nothing
worth
drinking
not
a
fruit
or
lambic
style
beer
d
from
what
i
have
read
on
this
beer
style
this
one
seems
to
match
it
perfectly
very
little
balance
going
on
here
but
the
flavor
of
tangerines
is
very
pronounced
and
enjoyable
flavor
and
mouthfeel
together
make
this
one
that
almost
anybody
could
enjoy
whether
or
not
they
appreciate
a
good
beer
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
not
much
of
a
head
especially
for
a
wheat
beer
what
there
is
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
a
small
layer
of
foam
appearance
is
a
moderately
cloudy
goldencopper
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
very
pleasant
tangerine
presence
though
malty
wheat
notes
are
detectable
in
the
background
those
malt
and
wheat
notes
are
nowhere
to
be
found
in
terms
of
taste
nicely
acidic
tangerine
is
present
in
abundance
but
the
beer
taste
itself
seems
a
bit
watered
down
more
maltiness
would
have
provided
balance
and
much
improvement
mouthfeel
is
very
refreshing
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
a
decent
and
refreshing
fruit
beer
but
it
is
lacking
in
traditional
wheat
beer
characteristics
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
slight
orangish
hue
it
has
a
beautiful
white
head
with
excellent
retention
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
modest
tangerine
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
crisp
wheat
beer
flavor
with
what
tastes
like
watered
down
orange
juice
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
fruit
flavor
here
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
this
is
an
average
fruitwheat
beer
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
another
one
of
these
any
time
soon
drinkability
nope
couldnt
even
get
half
way
on
the
pint
before
giving
it
up
to
a
friend
and
she
wouldnt
drink
it
because
she
didnt
want
to
waste
her
alcohol
intake
on
something
that
tasted
like
bad
clearly
canadian
its
as
if
someone
took
a
wheat
ale
and
squeezed
in
some
tangerine
it
has
a
real
sugary
taste
with
real
powerful
tangerine
flavor
like
other
reviews
if
you
dont
like
tangerine
you
dont
like
this
beer
to
me
its
almost
overwhelming
and
infact
borderline
in
the
same
category
mikes
hard
lemonade
but
since
i
love
lost
coast
i
wont
be
to
mean
it
is
in
fact
refreshing
on
account
of
its
higher
carbonation
and
the
wheat
beer
thats
hiding
under
the
tangerine
actually
has
good
flavor
this
is
another
good
beer
to
have
when
you
spending
some
time
in
the
sun
coming
out
of
the
ice
chest
a
few
degress
cooler
than
the
fridge
like
i
said
if
there
was
a
refreshment
rating
it
would
be
really
high
and
as
far
as
fruit
or
vegetable
beers
go
its
top
notch
i
have
had
this
beer
in
bottle
and
on
tap
when
i
tried
this
beer
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
normal
great
white
and
guiness
beers
i
usually
drink
it
had
good
appearance
and
smell
smells
like
tangerines
taste
was
good
with
strong
tangerine
tastes
after
a
few
of
was
feeling
great
nothing
was
too
special
about
it
a
good
over
all
beer
the
taste
and
smell
are
much
better
than
it
looks
easily
sessionable
for
those
interested
in
fruity
beers
i
enjoyed
one
of
these
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
d
pretty
high
you
know
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruity
wheat
beers
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
fruity
wheat
beer
and
considering
that
its
not
that
bad
drinkability
if
i
had
kids
this
is
what
id
put
in
their
lunchboxes
personally
ill
stick
to
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
soda
bomber
pours
a
cloudy
dull
orange
with
thin
soapy
head
and
little
lacing
nose
big
orange
juice
five
alive
beverage
smell
that
overpowers
any
malt
in
the
nose
taste
stale
fake
orange
juice
has
a
very
mineral
dryness
to
it
little
flavour
from
the
malt
a
screw
driver
would
be
much
more
satisfying
if
one
was
looking
for
an
orange
flavoured
adult
beverage
tangerines
are
evident
big
time
on
the
nose
and
to
lesser
extent
on
the
taste
both
though
come
off
as
artificial
to
me
the
taste
is
of
sweet
artificial
tangerine
flavoring
just
doesnt
taste
good
to
me
or
feel
right
syrupy
almost
nice
idea
with
the
tangerines
but
this
is
not
done
well
and
is
not
one
i
would
drink
again
good
low
carbonation
but
a
little
sweet
not
quite
as
sessionable
as
it
should
be
even
when
served
cold
on
a
hot
night
there
is
a
subtle
refreshing
carbonation
in
the
mouth
that
would
quench
a
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
of
this
than
i
had
to
this
beer
had
a
pretty
foggyhazzy
appearance
smelled
like
a
pretty
nice
tangerine
the
taste
was
quite
surprising
i
had
never
had
a
fruity
beer
before
but
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
there
was
medium
carbonation
from
what
i
noticed
in
my
opinion
fruity
beers
have
kinda
been
more
of
a
girlie
thing
but
after
finally
having
one
i
can
say
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
for
any
guy
enjoyable
when
you
just
want
to
kick
back
murky
looking
orange
body
fiery
streaks
of
ruby

bright
citrusy
and
full
of

like
it
taste
can
be
described
as
all
fruit
flavor
and
little
to
no
wheat
flavor
id
like
a
little
more
of
a
wheat
presence
but
this
really
isnt

bad
as
is
its
bright
and
spritzy
and
full
of
tangerine
a
citric
bitterness
lingers
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
fairly
jacked
up
could
be
used
as
a
decent
refresher
on
a
hot

bottle

a
hazy
light
orange
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
tangerine
and
other
citrus
and
a
touch
of
malt
flavor
is
also
tangerine
and
malt
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
smooth
and
light
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
my
thing
really
it
is
different
but
i
think
i
like
other
wheats
better
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
whote
head
nose
was
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
tangerine
and
wheat
taste
was
nice
pretty
balanced
just
enough
tangerine
to
give
it
a
great
taste
but
not
overpower
like
many
fruitwheat
beer
combos
low
abv
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
this
would
be
a
good
hot
summer
day
beer
but
not
a
session
beer
served
on
draft
in
a
plastic
cup
clear
dark
orangey
gold
with
a
modest
white
head
aroma
is
tangerine
grains
cream
and
citrus
flavor
is
grainy
with
banana
pith
notes
and
a
rather
decentlymelded
tangerine
note
doesnt
taste
overly
artificial
although
it
is
pretty
sweet
inoffensive
better
than
a
lot
of
crummy
fruit
wheat
beers
out
there
couldnt
drink
then
entire
bomber
too
sweet
but
a
good
beer
all
things
considered
give
this
one
a
try
hazy
orange
with
blonde
highlights
and
a
decent
cream
colored
cap
that
settles
quicky
to
a
skim
and
leaves
scaps
of
lace
behind
the
smell
is
pure
fresh
tangerine
rind
and
orange
candy
the
flavor
is
incredibly
fruity
like
a
shandy
or
radler
half
pale
wheat
beer
and
half
diet
orange
sodatangerine
juice
light
bodied
and
creamy
i
guess
the
drinkability
depends
on
how
much
you
like
fruit
flavor
in
your
beer
its
a
little
much
for
my
liking
lost
coast
tangerine
wheat
sounds
like
a
pretty
good
idea
too
bad
the
execution
leaves
a
little
something
to
be
desired
indica
ipa
and
8
ball
stout
are
still
this
brewerys
best
drinkability
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
it
will
definitely
prevent
scurvy
theres
nothing
really
offensive
about
this
beer
but
its
just
too
much
like
candy
as
ive
said
plenty
of
better
summer
beers
out
there
delicious
and
refreshing
serve
with
bacon
drinkability
i
really
want
to
like
this
beer
with
its
tangerine
and
wheat
profile
but
the
fruit
flavors
seem
cheap
more
wheat
malt
and
a
real
tangerine
addition
even
at
a
lesser
degree
would
improve
this
beer
last
time
i
had
an
orange
hefe
it
was
a
mandarin
hefe
from
grants
in
their
last
years
alive
it
was
over
carbonated
and
too
orangey
this
is
a
better
orange
beer
because
the
carbonation
level
is
on
the
lower
level
and
they
dont
knock
you
over
the
head
with
the
tangerine
taste
it
pours
a
kinda
cloudy
peachy
dark
gold
colour
with
little
head
the
beer
itself
is
a
pretty
good
wheat
with
the
tangerine
showing
up
in
the
midbody
and
the
finish
i
added
a
lime
slice
and
it
helped
the
acid
on
the
mouthfeel
and
then
i
added
half
a
whistler
wheat
to
added
a
more
hefe
flavour
i
ended
getting
a
real
nice
summer
beer
but
really
the
intial
product
is
just
ok
the
smell
was
awesome
one
whiff
and
you
were
overwhelmed
with
the
lovely
essence
of
the
tangerine
the
taste
was
fairly
bitter
with
a
good
wheat
malt
to
it
with
a
dominant
tangerine
it
was
pretty
thin
and
mildly
carbonated
overall
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
effort
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
twofinger
head
that
dies
quickly
and
has
a
very
fruity
springy
smell
i
like
fruit
beers
and
had
some
hopes
for
this
but
it
disapoints
first
it
is
sharp
and
sour
tasting
with
the
overcarbonation
also
the
fruit
taste
the
tangerine
but
i
feel
abused
paying
3

this

im
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
good
pretty
decent
fruity
beer
best
flavored
lager
there
is
o
wouldnt
seen
it
out
again
umm
no
thank
you
generally
like
fruit
beers
but
did
not
find
this
one
enjoyable
very
light
gold
almost
no
head
barely
any
lacing
there
is
just
an
off
smell
with
some
strong
blueberries
in
there
taste
is
similar
blueberries
but
not
much
else
other
than
something
off
very
light
not
much
substance
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
will
revisit
not
a
fan
of
blue
berry
beers
one
of
the
slightly
better
blueberry
beers
too
much
berry
flavor
for
me
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
of
sweet
blueberries
taste
is
crisp
malty
blueberries
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
indicate
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
the
body
is
right
and
its
light
without
needing
to
be
heavier
but
theres
something
a
little
slick
in
the
middle
though
it
doesnt
get
carried
away
its
nice
and
soft
with
a
good
carbonation
and
light
bite
of
crispness
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
it
reminded
me
of
sam
adams
blackberry
witbier
but
not
as
sweet
it
was
was
surprised
a
bit
by
the
toasted
notes
and
expected
it
to
be
a
brighter
more
floral
beer
this
wasnt
good
had
from
keg
but
not
sure
if
lines
were
dirty
or
what
place
i
was
at
had
40
taps
on
line
and
claimed
to
have
solid
cleaning
process
and
schedule
dont
think
i
would
try
another
popping
the
top
to
this
brew
it
has
a
smoky
type
smell
for
reasons
unknown
as
it
is
a
wheat
beer
with
blueberry
pouring
into
my
sapp
i
get
a
brew
with
a
bright
golden
color
and
a
thin
foamy
white
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
spicy
smoky
flavor
more
than
a
sweet
blueberry
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
aftertaste
is
consistent
with
the
upfront
flavor
nothing
too
spectacular
here
wont
seek
this
one
out
but
would
drink
it
if
offered
one
rich
blueberry
aroma
though
lacking
flavor
deep
golden
hue
filtered
blueberry
ale
not
a
fan
of
synthetic
fruit
beer
this
is
one
of
those
generic
golden
ales
with
fake
blueberry
flavor
in
the
finish
light
speckled
head
leaves
a
fine
trail
of
lacing
aroma
has
that
fruity
pebbles
blueberry
manufactured
food
additive
nose
flavor
is
slightly
tart
with
blueberrycitrus
notes
and
even
earthy
dry
grains
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
meant
to
be
consumed
in
the
warm
weather
this
beer
has
probably
found
its
audience
already
sorry
i
cant
do
this
regularly
my
guilty
pleasure
beer
blueberries
are
my
favorite
fruit
so
this
is
my
goto
beer
when
im
hungover
drinking
early
in
the
morning
for
some
reason
or
need
to
switch
from
high
abv
beers
to
something
more
sessionable
o
if
you
like
blueberries
give
it
a
try
otherwise
only
okay
i
thought
the
beer
managed
to
strike
a
nice
balance
of
fruit
and
beer
taste
i
can
see
grabbing
a
couple
more
of
these
in
the
heat
of
next
summer
overall
it
is
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
i
know
more
malty
taste
could
possibly
mask
the
blueberry
taste
that
they
want
to
shine
through
but
this
beer
needs
a
little
more
to
it
i
dont
mind
an
american
adjunct
lager
every
now
and
again
but
this
one
is
only
slightly
better
than
that
very
light
almost
honey
colored
with
hints
of
a
cereal
or
toasted
grain
with
a
nice
upfront
blueberry
aroma
after
poured
the
head
diminishes
quickly
to
about
a
half
finger
width
also
very
light
on
the
hoppy
side
has
a
real
light
feel
to
the
mouth
and
its
very
smooth
if
fruit
beer
is
for
you
this
one
is
worth
a
try
overall
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
this
one
again
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
closet
blue
drinkers
in
the
atl
pretty
tasty
not
six
pack
beer
prolly
one
or
two
glasses
and
youll
wanna
switch
to
something
else
but
a
lot
less
thick
and
consuming
then
blueberry
beers
out
there
the
blueberry
flavor
is
just
right
i
really
enjoyed
this
coming
from
a
brew
company
that
does
more
ipa
then
anything
else
this
was
a
decent
beer
it
has
a
blue
berry
taste
to
it
which
is
really
good
the
taste
is
not
too
strong
or
too
weak
the
smell
is
a
really
good
smell
as
well
you
can
taste
the
blue
berry
in
it
as
well
and
i
like
that
if
you
have
not
had
this
beer
before
and
you
like
the
taste
of
fruit
in
your
beer
than
you
need
to
try
this
one
o
it
is
what
it
is
its
a
dead
simple
yet
refreshing
fruit
beer
thats
panacea
during
100
degree
weather
i
like
how
it
isnt
as
cloying
as
certain
fruit
beers
also
not
great
but
itll
still
find
a
place
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
months
flavor
a
very
mild
hop
bitterness
lingers
at
the
end
other
than
that
there
is
some
sweet
bready
malt
flavors
and
a
grassy
wheat
taste
if
you
like
blueberries
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
it
truly
has
blueberry
flavor
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
o
this
would
be
a
good
summertime
poolside
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
its
a
nice
change
every
once
in
a
while
nice
and
crisp
blueberry
isnt
wicked
overwhelming
and
has
just
the
right
bit
of
tartness
to
be
intriguing
outside
of
the
blueberry
taste
smell
is
somewhat
missing
as
theres
just
a
hint
of
aroma
of
blueberry
on
the
nose
in
front
of
a
nearly
nonexistent
faint
no
strike
that
there
is
no
other
smell
appearance
is
pretty
pedestrian
as
well
with
virtually
no
lacing
or
head
sitting
on
a
mundane
gold
liquid
with
a
few
overachieving
bubbles
trying
to
escape
but
for
what
it
is
from
a
style
standpoint
it
is
pretty
good
and
could
serve
well
as
a
bmc
alternative
at
summer
parties
better
than
most
fruit
beers
in
that
it
still
tastes
like
a
decent
brew
good
aroma
poured
a
clear
and
effervescent
medium
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
head
has
minimal
retention
but
does
leave
a
modicum
of
lacing
there
is
a
pronounced
blueberry
aroma
with
a
slight
hint
of
the
wheat
beer
base
the
taste
follows
closely
with
distinct
blueberry
notes
and
mild
wheat
beer
characteristics
on
the
plus
side
the
blueberries
arent
overwhelming
or
cloying
there
is
a
slight
carbonation
feel
but
it
doesnt
go
too
far
towards
fizzy
not
a
bad
beer
and
if
you
like
fruitbased
flavors
in
your
beer
this
might
be
right
up
your
alley
i
was
hoping
for
more
wheat
beer
flavors
than
this
provided
overall
though
pretty
tasty
for
a
fruit
brew
refreshing
with
a
bit
more
to
it
than
fruit
o
i
would
say
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
a
6
pack
but
its
a
nice
beer
i
pick
it
up
every
now
and
then
when
i
have
a
craving
for
it
rjt
overall
eh
i
used
to
like
fruit
beers
back
in
the
day
this
one
isnt
great
but
not
terrible
not
something
id
drink
too
often
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
fruit
beers
o
recommended
im
one
to
score
fruit
beers
relatively
high
as
i
tend
to
enjoy
them
but
this
simply
fell
short
in
most
categories
this
isnt
terrible
but
its
pretty
average
tastes
like
a
lager
with
some
blueberry
thrown
in
o
it
is
not
a
great
blueberry
beer
the
base
beer
taste
is
too
prominent
and
bland
o
it
is
refreshing
but
a
bit
too
soapy
purchased
a
12
oz
bottle
at
a
publix
in
macon
ga
sure
can
taste
the
blueberries
but
its
just
too
sweet
in
the
wrong
way
its
not
a
complex
sweet
that
you
might
get
from
a
lambic
or
even
from
other
fruit
beers
its
just
sugar
in
my
extremely
limited
experience
sweetwater
beers
seem
to
be
sweeter
than
is
standard
for
the
style
e
g
the
420it
must
be
the
name
o
pleasant
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
but
i
doubt
id
choose
it
over
legions
of
other
offerings
o
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
would
probably
be
appealing
to
the
masses
this
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
grassy
and
grainy
the
taste
is
fairly
decent
for
its
style
as
its
light
in
body
and
flavor
its
perhaps
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
than
again
it
is
made
for
a
warmer
climate
than
where
i
am
from
hints
of
grass
and
grains
in
the
flavor
finishes
pretty
clean
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
blueberries
o
would
probably
be
better
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
while
out
in
the
sun
but
it
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
blueberry
beer
with
very
little
artificial
flavors
or
aroma
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
be
sessionable
pretty
refreshing
o
overall
not
a
bad
blueberry
beer
actually
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
quite
enjoyable
and
would
be
excellent
on
a
summer
day
yes
o
not
a
great
beer
all
things
considered
but
i
prefer
it
to
sea
dog
blue
since
the
blueberry
flavor
doesnt
overpower
better
on
draft
o
not
offensive
but
berry
flavor
doesnt
taste
natural
at
all
i
wont
be
having
another
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
a
fruit
beer
is
a
fruit
beer
yeah
it
tastes
a
little
artificial
but
its
not
overly
sweet
and
candy
like
the
wheat
comes
through
in
the
flavor
and
its
freaking
blueberry
this
is
worth
drinking
again
and
again
in
the
summer
this
is
a
simple
and
refreshing
fruit
beer
that
would
make
a
good
gateway
beer
for
someone
new
to
craft
brews
wow
this
is
undrinkable
really
really
terrible
o
good
summer
fruit
beer
o
this
is
what
i
expected
a
blueberry
ale
that
is
mostly
blueberry
and
not
particularly
interesting
o
this
is
truly
a
good
beer
if
you
are
one
for
blueberries
i
have
known
a
fair
number
of
friends
who
have
enjoyed
this
brew
but
personally
i
cannot
get
behind
drinking
such
a
rich
and
blueberryinfused
brew
for
anyone
who
loves
the
fruit
this
is
one
to
be
sought
after
im
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
beer
hits
the
spot
its
a
great
tasting
refreshing
session
beer
thats
perfect
on
a
hot
day
i
can
tell
that
ill
be
craving
this
beer
bad
from
time
to
time
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
bodied
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
nose
is
light
and
features
light
blueberry
muffin
and
has
a
light
cereal
wheat
aspect
its
subtle
the
flavors
too
are
light
and
approachable
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
blueberry
muffin
followed
by
pale
malt
and
a
yeastiness
that
leads
into
the
aftertaste
its
ok
its
somewhat
artificial
i
can
see
this
as
being
extremely
female
friendly
it
is
very
light
and
overly
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
an
outside
or
pool
beer
with
a
light
fruity
punch
this
could
be
your
beer
o
after
trying
a
handful
of
blueberry
themed
beers
over
the
years
ive
decided
that
its
a
flavor
thats
hard
to
incorporate
into
a
beer
without
it
seeming
artificial
however
this
particular
offering
is
actually
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
if
not
the
best
oddly
the
blueberry
character
seems
artificial
at
times
but
very
close
to
blueberry
pie
in
subsequent
tastes
this
certainly
qualifies
as
a
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
and
while
i
might
not
have
been
completely
won
over
by
the
flavor
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
succession
overall
certainly
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
a
fan
of
the
genre
especially
when
all
that
is
represented
is
the
fruit
while
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
must
say
it
goes
down
like
water
and
would
be
wonderful
on
a
hot
day
while
light
on
character
blue
is
thirst
quenching
and
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
during
a
ball
game
if
i
could
rank
it
on
a
0100
scale
i
would
rank
this
a
90
whether
my
actual
rating
equates
to
that
or
not
for
a
fruity
beer
it
has
a
tiny
bit
of
bitter
after
taste
but
not
so
much
that
i
cant
enjoy
it
other
than
that
i
really
like
this
beer
and
have
actually
drank
it
on
multiple
occasions
when
there
was
nothing
else
on
the
menu
that
was
on
the
fruity
side
except
for
blue
moon
which
i
now
find
boring
it
has
a
mild
blueberry
flavor
but
the
blueberry
aroma
is
lacking
overall
i
like
it
and
will
drink
it
if
i
have
limited
choices
palate
is
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
teh
flavor
and
aroma
department
this
is
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
better
than
the
other
fruit
beer
i
have
had
9
ultimately
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
could
use
a
hint
of
hops
to
help
the
finish
and
make
it
taste
more
like
a
beer
the
taste
is
most
akin
to
a
blueberry
cobbler
definitely
not
fresh
blueberries
o
while
this
is
otherwise
a
standard
filtered
wheat
as
i
mentioned
several
times
above
the
addition
of
the
hint
of
blueberries
makes
this
pacific
northwesterner
miss
the
fresh
berries
found
on
high
mountain
hillsides
its
clean
strange
and
smooth
making
this
otherwise
average
concoction
just
slightly
above
the
norm
overall
it
was
alright
i
thought
that
it
was
great
for
the
style
overall
impression
hearing
it
was
a
brew
with
blueberries
within
thought
it
would
be
refreshing
and
worth
it
it
was
just
nothing
i
would
drink
back
to
back
enjoyed
once
and
will
check
it
off
my
list
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
and
like
i
said
many
more
brews
from
sweetwater
that
will
keep
your
standards
high
try
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
desert
beer
that
wont
send
your
palette
into
confusion
o
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
really
just
a
macro
lager
soaked
in
blueberries
its
not
bad
its
just
very
unimpressive
try
it
if
you
dont
have
any
better
choices
but
certainly
dont
run
to
the
beer
store
in
any
hurry
to
get
this
sturdy
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
blueberry
twist
i
personally
like
blueberry
so
it
was
great
good
carbonation
but
very
light
feel
and
the
bitterness
kind
of
overpowered
the
flavor
for
me
id
drink
it
but
probably
wouldnt
ask
for
it
good
if
your
lookin
for
something
a
little
different
drank
from
the
bottle
so
no
coments
on
visuals
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
the
flavors
are
faint
and
mellow
theres
nothing
very
spectacular
here
taste
is
mild
but
balanced
nice
mix
of
wheat
and
blueberry
definitely
a
light
body
here
so
this
is
an
easy
drinker
solid
but
not
outstanding
i
could
drink
more
of
these
no
problem
grain
comes
out
much
more
in
the
flavor
and
even
flashes
some
grassy
hop
blueberry
is
prominent
but
not
overwhelming
and
does
not
really
take
the
sweet
route
what
does
that
all
add
up
to
unfortunately
a
decent
but
not
excellent
fruit
beer
that
is
quaffable
but
forgettable
all
the
components
fight
each
other
and
the
hop
aspect
rarely
seems
to
work
well
in
a
fruit
beer
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
fruit
beer
but
im
not
sure
how
soon
id
want
to
roll
with
this
one
again
well
this
ale
is
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
fruit
hybrid
but
they
description
on
the
bottle
does
not
really
lie
it
is
described
as
light
i
just
think
the
blueberry
flavor
should
have
been
more
dominate
o
its
one
of
sweetwaters
mainstays
and
i
can
see
why
on
a
hot
afternoon
this
would
go
down
easy
and
the
abv
would
keep
it
an
enjoyable
experience
the
blueberries
shine
in
this
beer
better
than
most
which
is
surprising
considering
the
fact
that
this
is
a
relatively
light
beer
very
good
job
sweetwater
will
definitely
make
an
appearance
at
my
4th
of
july
party
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
especially
since
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
very
happy
will
purchase
again
cheers
o
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
i
understand
why
so
many
in
the
south
love
it
i
want
more
overall
drinkability
single
worst
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
a
pleasant
enough
but
very
average
beer
overall
pretty
good
beera
little
too
fruity
for
my
taste
but
i
can
still
appreciate
the
beer
big
blueberry
smell
a
little
in
the
taste
its
a
light
golden
color
with
a
little
head
not
much
retention
its
one
of
those
summer
beers
that
i
sometimes
just
need
to
grab
when
it
gets
a
little
warm
out
overall
its
hard
to
really
get
down
on
this
beer
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
its
pretty
well
done
and
doesnt
have
the
too
much
of
a
sweet
syrupy
taste
to
it
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
is
the
aroma
it
is
intensely
blueberry
the
beer
poured
a
strawberry
blond
color
a
small
white
head
dissipated
rapidly
it
had
a
decent
lager
taste
but
with
very
little
carbonation
and
almost
no
hop
profile
if
you
can
say
it
has
a
blueberry
taste
it
would
be
the
sort
of
tanic
aftertaste
it
is
not
unpleasant
not
a
bad
beer
fun
to
drink
because
of
the
aroma
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
little
to
no
head
but
tons
of
carbonation
has
a
clear
yellowishgold
color
smells
of
strong
blueberry
flavor
and
it
is
a
bit
artificial
as
you
drink
this
one
the
front
is
a
sweet
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
and
as
it
moves
to
the
back
the
blueberry
comes
through
i
like
this
one
not
overly
amazed
by
it
would
buy
it
again
but
mainly
to
support
local
brewers
on
tap
at
the
filling
station
here
in
gboro
poured
a
very
light
slightly
hazed
golden
with
a
12
finger
white
head
atop
aromas
are
mainly
toasty
cereal
grains
with
a
light
smattering
of
blueberry
toasted
flavors
and
very
light
sweetnessthe
bluberry
is
light
and
in
the
finish
well
i
gues
if
you
are
lookin
for
a
no
brainer
with
a
hint
of
fruit
this
would
be
for
younot
me
m
light
bodied
and
personally
i
like
the
low
carbonation
o
not
impressed
by
my
second
sweetwater
beer
they
did
a
great
job
with
the
blueberry
flavor
and
they
taste
nice
and
refreshing
but
the
beer
is
just
too
water
and
thin
there
is
no
wheat
presence
in
this
and
i
would
prefer
several
blueberry
beers
over
this
no
need
to
get
it
again
but
glad
i
tried
pours
with
a
nice
3
finger
head
which
dissipates
quickly
light
carbonation
looks
like
pale
green
tea
smells
strongly
like
blueberries
tastes
light
and
refreshing
a
little
watery
to
me
but
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
this
style
if
you
like
blueberries
and
this
style
i
would
say
it
is
worth
trying
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
very
pleasant
after
mowing
the
yard
overall
wont
buy
this
beer
too
sweet
with
strong
fruity
aftertaste
this
brew
was
the
first
beer
after
abita
purple
haze
that
i
have
tried
with
any
fruit
resemblance
to
it
i
loved
the
smell
wow
you
could
open
this
brew
15ft
from
me
and
i
would
either
believe
i
was
at
ihop
or
you
just
opened
a
sweetwater
blue
smooth
very
smooth
clean
crisp
blueberry
taste
brilliant
finish
that
leaves
both
beer
and
blueberry
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
at
all
powerful
if
you
are
tired
of
your
girlfriend
drinking
to
many
fru
fru
drinks
that
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
buy
here
one
of
these
and
your
gold
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
works
overall
not
really
a
fan
of
fruity
beers
like
this
one
so
this
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
i
guess
i
shouldve
known
that
something
called
blue
wouldve
been
blueberry
in
nature
i
could
see
this
being
a
decent
crossover
beer
but
nothing
extraordinary
cheers
overall
this
fruit
beer
was
average
at
best
the
blueberrys
were
there
but
were
much
more
muted
then
they
were
in
the
aroma
while
still
keeping
all
the
sweetness
which
was
just
too
much
for
how
light
and
thin
this
beer
was
this
beer
may
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
want
something
light
and
easy
drinking
but
the
flavor
wouldnt
keep
my
attention
i
am
glad
i
gave
it
a
second
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
there
are
many
other
better
and
more
flavorful
fruit
beers
out
there
for
the
price
i
hope
the
other
sweetwater
beers
i
have
are
better
then
this
one
appearance
was
a
very
light
gold
the
white
head
was
respectably
sized
but
faded
quickly
the
smell
was
blueberry
duh
pretty
pleasant
scent
and
quite
distinct
this
got
my
hopes
up
for
a
good
taste
experience
big
letdown
to
me
it
tasted
like
seltzer
water
with
a
slight
blueberry
flavor
thus
the
mouthfeel
was
downright
watery
the
blueberry
taste
was
not
a
strong
as
the
scent
not
a
beer
id
pick
up
again
d
not
a
wow
beer
but
very
drinkable
as
it
is
a
nice
light
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
i
like
it
because
its
different
i
havent
seen
any
other
blueberry
wheat
ales
out
there
o
a
craft
beer
version
of
wild
blue
this
is
an
embarrassment
to
sweetwaters
otherwise
decent
lineup
they
should
get
rid
of
this
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
do
enjoy
blueberries
and
that
is
really
the
point
of
this
beer
its
not
complex
by
any
means
but
nice
on
a
summers
day
good
for
one
but
i
would
never
drink
a
6
pack
having
mostly
positive
experiences
with
sweetwater
brews
with
their
ipa
among
my
top
three
ipas
i
had
high
expectations
appearance
is
crisp
and
clear
with
an
orange
hue
controlled
head
the
aroma
is
the
highlight
of
this
beer
fun
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
pine
underneath
the
taste
is
refreshing
but
would
not
be
first
choice
for
my
wheat
beer
fix
on
a
hot
day
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
a
novelty
beer
that
makes
for
a
great
conversation
piece
but
it
wont
be
one
of
my
reliable
standbys
easy
drinking
but
not
that
great
not
much
going
on
here
tastes
like
a
light
beer
with
blueberry
o
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
really
good
nice
is
the
summer
as
it
is
tasty
light
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
blueberry
fruit
beers
out
there
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
and
in
particular
blueberry
beer
even
so
this
was
a
very
subpar
beer
tasted
overwhelmingly
of
blueberry
surprise
surprise
this
being
my
first
beer
from
sweetwater
it
did
not
bod
well
and
i
hope
that
their
other
beers
are
better
i
dont
like
to
judge
an
entire
brewery
based
on
a
bad
beer
or
a
good
one
for
that
matter
i
also
got
a
few
of
their
other
ones
and
expect
better
things
more
reviews
to
follow
i
wont
be
trying
this
beer
again
but
have
enjoyed
several
of
sweetwaters
beers
and
would
advise
anyone
to
pick
a
sweetwater
product
up
when
possible
d
gets
high
marks
here
i
think
i
found
my
new
lake
brew
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
how
the
blueberry
is
showcased
that
said
it
isnt
a
flavor
that
i
could
enjoy
very
often
for
what
it
is
it
is
good
so
you
may
want
to
give
it
a
shot
if
you
are
in
atlanta
this
brew
is
crisply
carbonated
and
very
light
bodied
the
drinkability
is
this
beers
strong
point
the
blueberries
just
narrowly
avoid
being
cloying
not
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
would
be
a
reliable
choice
if
we
got
this
on
a
regular
basis
in
tampa
d
everyone
i
know
hates
this
beer
and
maybe
i
have
a
bit
of
nostalgia
because
my
wife
and
i
have
fond
memories
of
our
vacation
where
this
brew
was
always
around
i
even
looked
for
big
flaws
but
couldnt
find
them
d
i
though
this
beer
was
going
to
be
dominated
by
the
blueberries
and
be
overly
sweet
i
was
happily
wrong
this
beer
was
much
more
balanced
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
actually
quite
good
got
the
big
22oz
mug
of
this
brew
not
a
very
big
head
about
a
finger
some
broken
lace
but
good
cling
looks
to
be
about
a
6
on
the
srm
chart
but
i
dont
have
the
chart
with
me
so
i
may
be
wrong
smell
of
blueberries
raspberries
some
honey
and
wheat
taste
is
overwhelmingly
blueberries
with
a
touch
of
raspberry
and
malt
just
sort
of
sickening
sweet
lacking
any
tang
and
crispness
some
body
and
creaminess
in
my
mouth
just
to
sweet
and
fruity
for
my
palate
my
neighbor
turned
me
on
to
sweet
water
blue
i
really
like
fruit
beers
and
i
really
love
blueberries
can
you
say
somebody
spilt
their
chocolate
on
my
peanutbutter
but
seriously
this
is
a
great
beer
the
color
is
a
light
gold
with
a
touch
of
haze
the
smell
is
of
blueberries
the
flavor
is
more
fruit
than
beer
which
isnt
bad
i
like
the
drinkability
with
the
finish
of
blueberries
i
think
the
combo
is
executed
well
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
taste
is
basically
what
you
would
expect
if
you
were
to
make
a
beer
from
blueberry
muffins
it
is
a
fairly
light
and
far
from
cloying
taste
but
it
dominates
what
is
a
pretty
monotonous
flavor
profile
very
easy
drinking
smooth
beer
kudos
for
making
it
not
very
sweet
and
over
the
top
but
it
isnt
all
that
interesting
pours
a
clear
yellow
a
bit
of
white
head
not
ugly
but
not
great
smells
strongly
of
blueberry
a
very
potent
scent
tastes
weird
too
much
blueberry
for
me
it
overpowers
everything
and
really
makes
it
not
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
its
fairly
drinkable
overall
not
something
i
would
drink
again
d
eh
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
dnicely
drinkable
again
very
suprising
but
wouldnt
drink
it
very
much
d
if
it
was
all
the
smell
itd
be
great
but
its
just
not
that
good
i
also
just
noticed
that
the
bottle
i
drank
had
a
best
if
drank
by
date
of
december

2010
and
its
currently
january
26
2011
looks
like
ill
be
trying
this
one
again
later
to
give
it
a
fair
chance
i
absolutely
bloody
love
this
beer
verdict
this
beer
is
easy
enough
for
to
drink
for
any
casual
drinker
but
isnt
very
bold
on
any
level
beyond
some
basic
flavors
theres
not
much
else
that
draws
this
beer
out
above
the
others
that
are
much
like
it
with
that
in
mind
its
about
on
the
same
level
as
many
other
wheat
and
blueberry
beers
but
more
subtle
not
half
bad
b

dnot
a
beer
for
me
to
fruity
in
my
eyes
definitely
a
good
beer
if
you
like
blueberries
though
goes
down
like
water
and
i
dont
really
mind
this
one
at
all
for
what
it
is
not
too
bad
overall
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
beer
average
blueberry
beer
at
best
but
i
can
see
some
nonbeer
lovers
liking
it
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsides
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintains
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
malt
stale
blueberry
and
muffins
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malt
blueberry
and
stale
muffins
it
has
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
not
really
sure
about
this
one
i
mean
i
know
what
they
were
trying
to
do
but
seriously
aroma
is
better
than
the
flavor
but
thats
not
saying
that
much
could
be
a
lot
better
but
could
be
a
lot
worse
d
if
you
like
blueberries
this
is
easy
to
drink
the
fruit
is
subtle
and
the
beer
is
watery
light
refreshing
and
weak
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
the
nose
brings
some
strong
blueberry
characteristics
the
taste
is
overly
dominated
by
the
blueberry
although
there
is
some
light
bread
underneath
as
well
the
feel
is
pretty
light
with
good
carbonation
and
the
blueberries
are
carried
well
drinks
really
quite
well
and
is
a
nice
sessionable
summer
brew
this
beer
pours
an
unremarkable
clear
gold
with
no
dissernable
head
as
with
most
fruity
beers
the
aroma
is
great
malty
with
a
hint
of
blueberries
the
taste
is
light
almost
watery
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
faint
blueberries
good
carbonation
but
an
average
fruit
beer
at
best
d
decent
blueberry
not
too
chemical
tasting
though
unlike
alot
of
other
blueberry
beers
id
like
to
have
again
d
watery
light
not
much
flavor
not
my
style
at
all
the
sweetwater
blue
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
and
leaves
no
trace
behind
not
much
to
the
nose
some
subtle
malts
and
bready
aromas
very
hard
to
get
any
fruit
smells
from
the
aroma
taste
is
quite
watery
with
a
very
subtle
fruity
finish
up
front
there
are
some
malts
and
pines
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
quite
watery
drinkability
is
mediocre
and
this
is
solely
due
to
the
low
abv
and
not
overpowering
characteristics
the
taste
is
ok
just
not
much
too
it
d
pretty
easy
to
drin
ive
always
thought
blueberry
is
a
difficult
choice
for
a
fruit
flavored
beer
because
the
flavor
can
so
easily
overwhelm
all
other
beer
aspects
and
you
wind
up
with
a
blueberry
candy
malternative
sweetwater
does
a
really
nice
job
of
moderating
the
blueberry
flavor
it
is
certainly
pronounced
but
not
overwhelming
with
a
fresh
fruit
quite
natural
blueberry
flavor
d
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
as
a
dessert
beer
or
for
a
hot
summer
day
although
the
flavoring
of
fruit
beers
tends
to
wear
thin
for
me
after
a
few
bottles
overall
i
dont
really
dig
it
its
a
good
beer
but
its
just
not
my
style
it
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
the
appeance
wasnt
all
that
it
did
not
have
much
head
and
no
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
the
smell
is
interesting
you
can
definetly
smell
the
blueberries
but
you
can
still
smell
some
of
the
hop
the
taste
is
a
lot
better
that
what
i
expected
i
was
suprised
the
mouthfeel
is
there
and
finishes
smooth
and
refreshing
which
makes
for
a
wonderfuld
drinkability
good
beer
even
though
i
am
not
much
for
a
fruity
beer
i
did
not
read
the
label
before
i
drank
the
beer
so
it
was
kind
of
a
suprise
lightish
body
medium
effervescence
focused
on
tongues
tip
bitter
at
the
swallow
mellowing
quickly
smoothish
finish
good
malty
aftertaste
with
some
blueberry
note
good
overall
but
would
like
more
of
the
blueberry
to
show
up
picky
huh
md
light
feel
that
lacked
carbonation
making
it
a
little
easier
to
drink
and
offers
a
refreshing
experience
well
i
got
this
from
a
beer
trade
from
north
carolina
i
was
told
this
was
one
of
the
better
sweetwater
beers
well
it
wasnt
half
bad
nothing
that
i
am
jumping
on
the
phone
with
my
mother
saying
i
just
had
this
amazing
beer
amazing
it
is
not
drinkable
yes
very
light
ale
which
smells
wonderful
the
taste
is
just
ok
and
the
after
taste
is
pretty
pleasant
blueberries
are
definitely
in
the
beer
but
not
over
powering
like
the
sea
dog
version
great
beer
for
the
summer
time
all
in
all
not
too
bad
but
i
know
there
are
better
blueberry
beers
out
there
d
super
drinkable
i
would
love
to
have
these
on
a
hot
summers
day
with
the
grill
going
if
i
had
a
grill
that
is
drinks
welldefinitely
a
good
hot
afternoon
drinker
refreshing
md
mouthfeel
has
a
slightly
artificial
taste
but
very
similar
to
other
sweetwater
beers
its
a
reasonably
drinakble
fruit
beer
but
nothing
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
drinkability
a
solid
fruit
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
the
blueberries
have
a
real
not
artificial
taste
nothing
extraordinary
just
a
solid
fruit
beer
overall
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
beer
average
blueberry
beer
at
best
but
i
can
see
some
nonbeer
lovers
liking
it
drinkability
i
just
cant
give
it
a
decent
score
here
as
i
just
cant
get
into
the
flavor
its
not
like
im
even
drinking
a
beer
dall
concentrate
and
still
tasted
watered
down
drain
pour
my
first
in
reviewing
history
this
is
a
too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
sweeter
blue
moon
overall
impression
disappointing
offering
from
a
brewery
ive
enjoyed
otherwise
lacking
in
real
fruit
character
notes
a
good
fruity
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
this
is
a
gateway
beer
for
many
of
my
noncraft
drinking
friends
here
in
atlanta
my
girlfriend
also
happens
to
be
a
fan
of
this
again
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
so
dont
let
anyone
tell
you
it
is
however
it
is
a
very
fruity
beer
so
just
know
what
to
expect
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
loaded
with
blueberries
its
like
sniffing
a
warm
blueberry
muffin
very
strong
smell
taste
is
as
expected
blueberries
it
actually
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
fruity
pebbles
blueberry
sweetness
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
light
to
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
d
certainly
an
interesting
brew
ive
had
a
handful
of
blueberry
beers
and
this
one
is
easily
the
best
not
something
that
i
would
get
often
but
worth
trying
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
southern
day
its
a
great
alternative
for
bmc
drinkers
in
the
south
where
there
are
lots
of
bmc
drinkers
but
its
rater
unsatisfying
on
an
early
november
evening
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
though
in
spite
of
its
foibles
i
was
ready
for
another
when
the
first
was
finished
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
by
far
my
favorite
fruit
beer
that
ive
tried
so
far
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
bowl
of
fruity
pebbles
the
fruit
flavor
is
subtle
and
restrained
but
still
there
another
good
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
this
but
i
feel
sweetwater
has
much
better
offerings
thanks
ben
for
the
chance
overall
as
i
previously
aluded
to
great
if
you
need
a
sweet
tooth
fix
bad
if
you
are
looking
for
subtlety
this
beer
is
ubersweet
and
packed
full
of
blueberries
take
it
or
leave
it
drinkability
is
good
what
a
good
fruit
beer
should
be
very
aromatic
and
not
too
sweet
with
a
fresh
character
not
overdone
but
just
right
cheers
pop
the
cap
and
blueberries
fill
the
room
blueberries
dont
smell
this
good
by
themselves
thin
halo
of
a
head
very
light
lime
type
color
moderate
carbonation
so
expecting
a
lot
of
blueberry
flavor
from
the
aroma
you
certainly
get
it
when
you
turn
it
up
i
have
a
hard
time
deciding
whether
id
rather
eat
blueberries
or
drink
this
beer
i
think
ill
go
for
the
beer
blueberries
when
you
pop
the
cap
blueberries
in
the
nose
blueberries
in
the
mouth
blueberry
after
taste
and
blueberry
dreams
the
taste
is
blah
not
much
there
and
fairly
one
dimensional
again
the
malt
sweetness
is
the
primary
taste
there
is
some
trace
amounts
of
blueberry
but
nothing
worth
bragging
about
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
and
would
drink
this
as
a
lawnmower
beer
if
i
had
regular
access
to
it
aroma
of
course
is
blueberry
but
light
and
nice
same
with
the
quaff
bits
of
malt
backbone
sturdy
up
the
mix
firm
carbonation
supplement
the
body
easy
drinking
beer
nice
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
one
d
could
drink
many
of
these
great
summer
time
beer
if
you
like
something
on
the
sweet
side
balanced
and
easydrinking
with
a
blueberry
character
that
is
complementary
rather
than
dominating
which
is
just
the
way
things
should
be
a
nice
beer
for
more
novice
drinkers
with
no
outlandish
characteristics
battering
the
palate
or
vying
for
dominance
quite
a
nice
fruit
beer
but
one
that
could
do
with
more
body
light
bodied
with
a
fizzy
feel
and
the
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
has
a
light
body
smooth
and
decent
drinkability
felt
like
it
was
a
little
over
carbonated
overall
less
than
average
beer
i
doubt
that
i
would
ever
order
this
beer
again
so
if
theres
any
drawback
or
defect
to
this
beer
its
that
the
head
simply
doesnt
last
that
long
and
the
lacing
is
limited
otherwise
its
quite
nice
md
light
bodied
prickly
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
imagine
from
the
appearance
mouthfeel
is
probably
on
par
with
what
the
brewers
wanted
drinkability
is
good
if
all
you
are
looking
for
is
something
wet
but
a
this
beer
is
very
plain
outside
of
that
future
outlook
for
a
low
abv
beer
that
is
past
its
prime
this
has
held
up
remarkably
well
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
and
am
intrigued
to
try
some
other
brews
from
sweetwater
ifwhen
i
get
the
chance
d
a
pleasant
surprise
for
sure
though
its
sort
of
a
one
trick
pony
and
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
day
this
is
pretty
solid
for
a
fruit
flavored
wheat
beer
poured
a
deep
piss
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
hops
malt
and
blueberrybut
with
a
soapy
astringent
smell
taste
is
of
light
blueberry
astringent
soap
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
blueberry
but
finishes
with
a
grainwheat
style
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
very
similar
to
the
bottle
version
ive
tasted
in
the
past
d
for
a
fruitfocused
brew
this
is
pretty
good
although
the
blueberries
dont
have
any
complex
interplay
with
the
malt
or
the
hops
at
least
it
doesnt
taste
like
blueberry
seltzer
one
of
the
best
ways
i
can
describe
this
beer
is
as
a
better
more
rounded
more
focus
version
of
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
sure
it
tastes
like
blueberries
but
for
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
at
least
the
fruit
flavor
never
becomes
overwhelming
a
decent
refreshing
brew
for
the
right
occasion
i
could
drink
these
all
summer
i
like
it
check
it
out
m
d
a
pleasant
beer
with
a
lighter
and
rather
crisp
body
its
an
easy
drinker
and
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
without
complaint
though
it
may
be
something
id
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
not
bad
drinkable
yeah
refreshing
yeah
tastes
like
a
liquid
blueberry
muffin
yeah
if
im
in
the
right
mood
i
could
see
this
one
really
hitting
the
spot
if
theres
a
beer
to
go
with
pancakes
this
is
it
i
wonder
if
you
can
make
pancakes
with
the
help
of
this
brew
hmmm
very
tasty
drinkability
an
exceptional
session
beer
and
one
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
its
mild
enough
to
keep
it
sessionable
and
while
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
blueberry
flavor
theres
enough
of
it
in
there
to
keep
it
interesting
solid
beer
a
enjoyed
this
very
quaffable
with
a
nice
blueberry
taste
that
doesnt
overdue
it
i
could
kill
a
couple
of
these
easily
pours
a
cleanclear
pale

nice

white

with

the

with

this
is
a
tasty
brew
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
with
low
taste
bud
drinkers
would
highly
approve
not
a
great
beer
advocate
beer
though
this
is
an
excellent
lawnmowergatewaysummereasydrinking
blueberry
beer
that
doesnt
taste
fake
still
tastes
like
beer
and
goes
down
wicked
easy
whats
wrong
with
that
if
i
enjoy
it
when
its
12
degrees
outside
thisll
be
fun
to
have
during
the
summer
poured
about
4
of
these
things
and
could
only
generate
the
faintest
of
heads
the
smell
was
pleasant
dominated
by
blueberries
the
taste
was
oversweet
but
the
flavors
were
not
unpleasant
mouthfeel
was
unremarkable
perhaps
a
little
thin
with
low
carbonation
the
sweetness
really
detracts
from
the
drinkability
for
me
and
i
could
not
drink
more
than
12
at
a
time
d
i
had
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
for
lunch
i
would
have
had
more
had
i
been
there
longer
certainly
seems
like
an
easydrinking
type
of
beer
to
introduce
to
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
its
light
inoffensive
and
it
has
blueberries
certainly
cant
go
wrong
with
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
feels
a
bit
odd
to
be
drinking
it
in
early
winter
in
the
northeast
not
too
drinkable
for
me
since
the
champane
aspect
is
not
attractive
notes
it
was
really
successful
in
being
a
blueberry
beer
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruitty
beers
d
a
nice
change
of
pace
poured
a
slightly
hazey
yellow
with
a
nice
head
that
diaspers
to
nothing
quick
the
sent
of
blueberrys
gently
hit
my
nose
as
i
poured
this
one
the
taste
is
light
and
fizzy
lots
of
blueberrys
in
the
after
taste
but
not
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
the
begining
flavor
is
caned
corn
and
a
hint
of
sour
malt
the
middle
is
ware
the
bluberrys
start
in
thay
are
mild
and
unsweet
than
the
aftertaste
is
ware
the
sweetness
of
the
berrys
finaly
comes
through
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
but
not
an
all
year
beer
for
me
d
i
dont
usually
gravitate
towards
fruit
beers
but
sweetwater
is
a
good
brewery
this
is
a
solid
and
refreshing
beer
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
well
done
nonetheless
that
would
be
the
main
positive
id
give
this
brew
you
cant
put
it
down
it
drinks
so
easily
very
sessionable
the
fruit
is
not
overpowering
or
anything
its
very
good
drinkabilityit
does
go
down
easy
good
drinkability
i
think
it
maybe
to
sweet
to
drink
many
of
these
in
a
row
its
an
ok
brew
not
my
favorite
blueberry
drinkability
a
nice
even
bodied
ale
with
solid
malt
flavors
just
enough
blueberry
in
the
finish
without
being
overly
sweet
or
cloying
this
beer
isnt
so
sweet
that
it
couldnt
be
enjoyed
more
than
one
at
a
time
poured
a
dark
yellowgolden
color
with
very
little
head
that
was
gone
very
quickly
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
smell
of
blueberries
the
flavor
is
a
bit
wheaty
and
the
blueberry
taste
is
extremely
subtle
this
is
smooth
refreshing
and
a
good
thirst
quencher
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
but
a
nice
fruit
beer
it
tastes
like
blueberry
candy
so
if
you
like
that
taste
and
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
pair
it
with
pale
bready
malts
this
beer
is
made
for
you
im
not
a
huge
fan
and
find
the
transition
from
the
fruit
flavor
to
malt
aftertaste
to
be
rough
and
a
touch
astringent
on
par
with
other
good
blueberry
brews
d
low
abv
slightly
malty
and
thin
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
but
isnt
for
me
tried
this
one
years
ago
but
this
review
corresponds
to
a
sample
on
tap
at
the
airport
classy
poured
a
gorgeous
goldenstraw
hue
but
very
little
head
and
no
retention
no
lacing
either
aromas
clearly
of
blueberries
bananas
and
wet
straw
flavors
are
sweet
and
fruity
with
the
unmistakable
blueberry
character
out
front
a
graininess
in
the
malt
gives
this
beer
further
tang
wheat
is
subdued
beneath
the
sugars
perfect
carbonation
and
a
light
body
helps
this
beer
be
very
sessionable
and
probably
a
great
brew
for
the
girls
smooth
but
slightly
zippy
on
the
tongue
some
hops
at
the
very
end
provide
a
clean
finish
good
example
of
a
fruit
beer
and
one
of
the
best
blueberry
beers
i
know
of
this
is
a
very
well
done
fruit
beer
the
blueberry
is
infused
very
well
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
and
even
if
youre
not
it
wont
be
a
bad
decision
this
isnt
the
best
fruit
beer
that
i
ever
had
but
it
certainly
would
be
refreshing
on
those
oppressive
atlanta
summer
afternoons
recommended
md
light
bodied
very
crisp
and
well
carbonated
an
interesting
fruit
beer
but
a
little
too
tart
to
be
very
drinkable
easy
drinking
summer
brew
i
enjoyed
this
brew
more
than
i
had
anticipated
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
sampled
d
i
wouldnt
drink
these
all
night
but
i
could
definitely
make
a
dent
in
that
6pack
on
a
hot
afternoon
this
beer
hits
the
spot
drinkability
is
moderately
low
flavor
is
ok
and
alcohol
is
low
so
its
definitely
easy
enough
to
drink
however
after
a
while
the
flavor
will
overwhelm
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
fruit
beer
though
some
additional
depth
would
much
improve
the
taste
the
light
body
and
crisp
refreshing
feel
make
it
sessionable
and
enjoyable
a
good
hotweather
refresher
but
not
much
else
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
think
it
could
be
good
summertime
beer
i
really
cant
say
anything
bad
about
the
beer
other
than
i
prefer
stouts
i
would
have
another
i
think
that
most
people
would
enjoy
one
or
two
of
these
pours
up
a
uriney
yellow
not
much
head
smell
is
blueberries
i
think
thats
all
i
get
taste
is
sweet
blueberries
a
very
mild
bite
in
the
finish
possibly
some
slight
acidics
light
bodied
low
carbo
easy
summer
brew
but
i
probably
wouldnt
enjoy
a
fuller
sixer
of
it
d
great
summer
beer
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
while
sitting
on
the
porch
after
some
yard
work
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
could
see
this
wearing
me
out
after
a
few
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
m
very
pleasant
carbonation
which
enhances
the
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
easy
quaffer
poured
a
nice
light
amber
color
although
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
has
a
nice
blueberry
scent
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
undertones
although
the
real
beer
scent
is
overpowered
by
the
fruit
nice
taste
a
very
fruity
ale
but
again
the
blueberry
overpowers
the
ale
there
is
a
nice
berry
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
maltiness
goes
down
fine
this
is
an
excellent
fruited
ale
if
you
really
want
a
berry
taste
as
opposed
to
a
berry
enhanced
ale
as
i
was
in
the
airport
in
ga
i
decided
to
stop
in
to
the
sweetwater
brewhouse
during
my
trip
to
ga
i
had
tried
their
ipa
and
420
and
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
grab
something
new
i
enjoy
blueberry
beers
but
have
only
had
them
from
northern
breweries
this
is
a
decent
blueberry
beer
honey
colored
with
very
little
blueberry
scent
compared
to
other
blueberry
beers
the
taste
of
blueberry
seemed
to
be
merely
a
hint
it
was
pleasant
and
drinkable
the
only
improvement
i
would
add
is
to
add
blueberries
to
the
beer
i
know
fruit
the
beer
i
said
it
but
its
true
thanks
to
maria
for
picking
this
up
for
me
in
her
travels
i
can
admit
that
as
fruit
beers
go
i
like
it
and
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
free
but
as
far
as
beers
from
sweetwater
go
its
my
fourth
or
fifth
choice
depending
on
if
theres
a
seasonal
available
color
is
a
typical
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
good
for
an
ale
with
a
decided
blueberry
overtone
blueberry
flavor
dominates
the
taste
which
is
otherwise
average
but
tasty
and
refreshing
a
smooth
and
delightful
ale
d
fruit
beers
arent
my
first
choice
of
beer
but
this
one
is
very
good
for
the
style
and
id
say
its
worth
a
try
overall
this
might
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
cutting
the
grass
aside
from
that
i
cant
say
that
i
can
recommend
this
beer
12
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
the
aroma
is
definitely
blueberries
and
not
really
anything
else
fortunately
they
are
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
pretty
good
the
blueberries
are
evident
but
not
overly
done
there
is
a
hint
of
dryness
in
the
finish
overall
decent
and
refreshing
d
i
am
torn
by
this
brew
it
is
unremarkable
lacking
character
and
features
that
would
recommend
it
its
selling
point
blueberry
flavors
are
so
recessive
as
to
not
be
distinct
enough
to
encourage
a
berry
lover
to
order
a
second
bottle
it
has
a
nice
creamy
tangy
mouth
feel
but
lacks
a
clean
aftertaste
i
would
pass
if
offered
it
in
the
future
light
and
crisp
not
as
sweet
and
sugary
as
other
blueberry
beers
i
have
tried
i
would
recomend
it
to
anyone
who
has
never
had
a
good
example
of
a
blueberry
beer
sweetwater
is
a
great
regional
brewery
i
have
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
served
in
a
pint
glass
looks
a
bit
like
a
macro
pilsner
but
slightly
darker
decent
bright
white
head
nose
is
intense
sweetened
blueberry
juice
and
corn
taste
is
mild
blueberries
and
thats
about
it
very
one
dimensional
mouthfeel
is
average
and
drinkability
is
pretty
high
just
not
that
interesting
of
a
beer
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
but
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
overall
it
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
definitely
an
interesting
beer
a
grainy
taste
however
doesnt
mesh
perfectly
with
the
blueberries
but
well
enough
to
be
quite
drinkable
the
two
flavors
seem
to
mesh
increasingly
less
well
as
the
brew
warms
up
so
this
might
be
one
to
keep
ice
cold
poured
into
a
sabl
glass
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
fruit
with
slight
blueberry
and
mild
hops
the
taste
is
an
extractlike
blueberry
mixed
with
sweet
malt
dominating
some
very
subdued
citrus
hops
the
beer
is
rather
crisp
and
very
light
with
a
normal
level
of
carbonation
this
is
certainly
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
but
the
fruit
flavor
of
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
fresher
tried
this
one
at
the
brewerys
friday
afternoon
happy
hour
while
visiting
atlanta
a
great
time
i
highly
recomended
stopping
by
if
you
are
in
the
atl
looks
fairly
nondistinct
just
kind
of
a
thin
golden
color
with
little
bit
of
white
head
that
quickly
dissapeared
smell
packed
a
punch
blueberries
and
wheat
i
could
catch
a
whiff
of
it
from
2
feet
away
the
taste
however
was
much
somewhat
muted
it
was
malty
and
fruity
but
not
as
fruity
as
i
thought
it
would
be
after
the
smell
there
was
also
some
light
hoppiness
to
give
it
a
more
rounded
taste
than
just
fruit
juice
but
for
the
most
part
this
beer
was
onedemensional
mouthfeel
was
light
and
well
carbonated
i
liked
this
beer
enough
and
it
was
light
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
but
i
didnt
really
want
another
one
after
i
was
done
first
chance
to
try
sweetwater
in
south
carolina
very
nice
had
to
go
into
barleys
to
find
it
as
it
was
no
where
to
be
seen
outside
but
i
may
have
just
missed
it
anyway
it
poured
a
fairly
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
large
fizzy
white
head
this
gradually
faded
and
was
replaced
by
a
thin
film
of
lace
and
copious
amounts
dripping
down
the
side
ample
carbonation
could
be
seen
in
the
somewhat
hazy
interior
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
light
not
overwhelming
with
the
fruit
at
all
but
rather
very
subtly
blueberry
with
hints
of
yeast
and
a
somewhat
muted
hop
presence
a
touch
of
bread
like
malts
in
the
back
the
taste
was
lighter
then
what
i
had
thought
a
typical
yeasty
pale
with
a
significant
touch
of
blueberry
in
the
front
ample
carbonation
again
gave
it
a
very
nice
and
light
feeling
along
with
keeping
it
from
going
flat
there
was
a
decent
enough
dry
finish
and
the
flavor
did
linger
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
i
put
the
first
one
down
in
no
time
flat
but
as
far
as
how
many
i
could
have
the
sweetness
may
limit
this
as
i
find
after
too
many
i
start
to
get
a
little
queasy
now
overall
this
was
not
bad
by
any
means
i
thought
it
to
be
a
rather
nice
light
fruity
brew
however
i
will
stick
to
my
ipas
in
the
future
drinkability
its
alright
but
as
with
most
fruit
beers
one
helping
is
more
than
enough
for
me
slightly
hazed
pale
yellow
color
under
a
thin
quickly
vanishing
bubbly
white
head
smells
like
blueberries
not
artificial
but
like
the
real
deal
very
much
like
blueberry
pancakes
actually
only
with
a
faint
citrus
note
and
a
musty
whiff
here
and
there
luckily
the
flavor
of
the
berries
does
not
dominate
theres
enough
grain
and
mild
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
nicely
leaving
you
with
a
beer
that
is
unmistakably
a
fruit
beer
but
not
in
an
overwhelming
syrupy
kind
of
way
pretty
light
in
body
with
a
refreshing
amount
of
carbonation
hopefully
this
will
make
it
to
the
eastern
half
of
the
state
by
next
summer
as
this
would
make
a
great
summer
thirstquencher
drinkability
yes
nothing
overpowering
here
a
good
crisp
clean
brew
with
mild
complexity
good
on
a
hot
day
or
if
you
want
something
to
stand
out
with
mild
but
direct
good
flavors
i
am
typically
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
vegetable
beers
but
sweetwater
blue
has
a
suddle
taste
of
blueberry
which
is
refreshing
during
the
summer
months
in
hotlanta
it
is
a
good
compliment
to
the
hot
wings
and
blue
cheese
i
enjoyed
during
the
tasting
smells
much
better
than
it
tastes
though
still
a
pretty
yummy
beer
id
trade
a
bit
of
drinkability
for
more
body
but
i
bet
itd
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
poursa
fizzy
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
intensely
of
sweetened
blueberries
not
artificial
exactly
but
quite
candyish
and
a
little
bit
cloying
the
taste
is
thankfully
a
little
more
subtle
but
still
a
little
much
the
body
is
so
light
and
the
beer
is
sweet
enough
to
be
a
little
alchopoppy
but
a
little
higher
quality
eh
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dies
down
pretty
quick
lacing
is
nonexistant
crazy
amount
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
young
blueberries
with
a
nice
wheat
background
no
hops
or
malt
in
the
nose
taste
is
pretty
weak
on
the
blueberry
kind
of
disappointed
about
that
wheat
and
a
bit
of
spice
as
well
tingle
the
tounge
very
light
bodied
fresh
crisp
clean
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
one
of
two
blueberry
beers
ive
had
the
other
being
wachusett
blueberry
and
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
i
would
go
for
wachusett
good
attempt
at
this
type
of
beer
sweetwater
but
could
tweek
the
flavoring
a
bit
to
make
this
even
better
pours
clear
yellow
with
no
head
and
very
slight
lace
smells
almost
cloyingly
sweet
blueberries
unfermented
sugar
perhaps
a
touch
of
corn
flavor
is
very
poor
unripedened
green
blueberries
leafy
stems
and
creamed
corn
thin
body
with
vague
carbonation
not
something
ill
return
to
pours
goldenrod
colored
with
thin
head
that
leaves
quickly
smell
is
of
berries
and
grass
blueberry
is
there
and
obvious
but
not
overpowering
taste
is
fruitberry
forward
but
there
is
a
little
yeastbread
undertone
that
was
not
expected
in
a
bad
way
the
taste
was
not
bad
just
off
a
little
from
my
expectation
carbonation
was
good
and
body
about
right
for
style
of
beer
decently
drinkable
more
of
a
warm
weather
beer
in
my
book
sweetwater
blue
pours
producing
very
little
head
that
dissipates
into
nothing
within
a
few
minutes
it
gives
off
an
aroma
like
blueberry
muffints
but
tastes
a
bit
more
peppery
than
like
blue
berries
the
initial
taste
is
like
the
aftertaste
of
a
blueberry
muffin
but
finishes
a
bit
peppery
as
i
previously
said
this
brew
feels
kind
of
syrupy
and
finishes
kind
of
weak
aroma
has
just
a
hint
of
the
fruit
not
overbearing
but
you
know
what
it
is
taste
is
good
the
blueberry
is
subtle
and
i
can
get
some
sweet
malt
flavor
also
hops
are
very
mild
sweetwater
makes
great
beer
this
one
is
good
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
could
quaff
two
or
three
but
would
need
to
switch
to
something
heavier
this
is
the
way
a
beer
with
fruit
should
taste
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
12207
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
no
lace
smells
of
what
else
blueberries
with
a
slight
spicyness
behind
it
blueberries
are
not
predominate
in
the
taste
although
they
are
there
behind
the
initial
blueberry
flavor
is
a
caramel
malt
followed
by
a
slight
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
finishing
with
a
fruit
like
aftertaste
very
spritzy
with
high
carbonation
a
good
summer
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
two
in
a
sittting
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
on
the
one
hand
i
think
they
did
a
nice
job
with
the
blueberry
flavor
so
that
it
complements
rather
than
dominates
the
problem
is
that
there
is
not
much
there
to
complement
or
dominate
easy
to
drink
though
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
especially
on
a
hot
day
but
i
really
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
not
a
typical
style
you
find
all
over
but
it
is
served
in
many
atlanta
bars
the
brewery
guide
said
they
are
only
distributing
in
a
limited
area
so
those
of
us
in
the
northeast
will
not
be
seeing
sweetwater
anytime
soon
overall
an
ok
blueberryflavored
ale
worth
a
try
d
not
a
lot
going
on
here
i
love
sweetwater
but
they
should
have
gotten
rid
of
this
instead
of
exodus
porter
in
favor
of
the
new
summer
hummer
this
is
my
girlfriends
favorite
craft
beer
because
its
not
bitter
that
should
tell
you
all
you
need
to
know
thanks
to
silentsabre
for
including
this
one
ideal
for
summertime
thirst
quenching
this
beer
offers
a
lot
to
whet
the
whistle
but
lacks
enough
character
to
appeal
to
the
serious
craft
beer
enthusiasts
at
least
after
the
aroma
served
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
appearance
is
very
plain
golden
poured
with
little
head
dissipated
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
where
this
beer
does
very
well
smelling
very
strongly
of
blueberries
which
is
obviously
what
its
going
for
taste
follows
suit
strong
blueberry
flavor
which
i
think
is
quite
delicious
still
has
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
average
nothing
special
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
1
give
it
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
but
dont
waste
time
seeking
it
out
exclusively
this
was
a
tough
one
to
rate
it
was
a
very
good
blueberry
pancake
syrup
unfortunately
i
was
drinking
beer
initial
aroma
of
blueberries
is
strongly
present
the
second
the
bottle
is
opened
and
stays
throughout
the
glass
however
at
mid
glass
i
also
detected
a
slight
soapy
aroma
appearance
is
golden
yellow
with
thick
white
head
and
decent
lacing
flavor
was
more
of
the
blueberry
taste
and
finish
was
so
strongly
blueberry
if
i
hadnt
known
better
i
would
have
sworn
i
just
finished
a
good
breakfast
instead
of
an
after
work
drink
sadly
like
with
pancakes
a
little
of
this
beer
goes
a
long
way
and
i
couldnt
have
many
this
beer
poured
a
light
straw
color
with
a
small
head
there
was
very
little
head
retention
smell
was
sweet
and
like
a
floralberry
smell
taste
is
a
sweet
blueberry
that
balances
well
with
the
light
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
without
lingering
as
for
drinkability
i
would
surprisingly
like
another
right
now
drinkability
fruit
beers
dont
bother
me
the
way
they
do
some
others
so
i
would
give
this
good
marks
as
a
drinkable
beer
for
those
who
like
a
fruity
twist
without
much
else
going
on
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
saw
this
in
atlanta
recently
i
didnt
buy
it
since
i
most
often
hate
fruit
laced
beers
but
i
tried
one
anyway
the
beer
is
a
light
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
it
smells
mainly
of
blueberries
it
tasted
mainly
of
blueberries
with
slight
hop
taste
pretty
decent
for
a
blueberry
beer
ill
give
it
that
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
a
week
though
drinkability
is
also
horrible
i
can
drink
one
of
these
and
after
that
i
feel
like
any
more
and
ill
be
needing
a
railing
to
vomit
over
it
sits
on
your
stomach
and
on
top
of
that
it
sours
very
quickly
this
is
not
a
good
session
beer
or
in
my
opinion
a
good
anything
beer
if
you
want
a
fruit
beer
get
some
purple
haze
im
not
normally
a
fruit
beer
fan
but
this
was
good
this
is
also
my
first
blueberry
beer
i
like
it
this
beer
pours
a
dull
gold
with
not
much
head
that
doesnt
hold
or
lace
well
the
smell
is
all
blueberries
and
a
little
overpowering
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
mostly
blueberries
with
very
little
beer
taste
there
is
a
decent
carbonation
but
its
a
little
watery
overall
its
too
fruity
and
sweet
and
not
enough
of
a
beer
michael
crying
in
my
cereal
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
my
favorite
watering
hole
it
pours
nearly
the
same
color
as
sweetwaters
signature
brew
420
pale
ale
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
however
the
head
fades
faster
and
give
some
lacing
on
the
early
part
of
the
mug
the
smell
is
a
blast
of
in
your
face
blueberries
smells
like
booberry
kids
cereal
the
taste
is
of
blueberries
but
the
berry
flavor
tastes
too
refined
to
me
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
the
blueberry
flavor
doesnt
seem
to
blend
with
the
beer
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
i
think
i
will
stick
to
purple
haze
when
i
feel
the
need
for
a
light
fruit
beer
i
love
everything
sweetwater
makes
however
this
one
falls
short
for
me
no
a
half
bad
blueberry
ale
here
definitely
light
and
spritzy
and
a
warm
weather
and
summer
beer
a
good
choice
for
a
light
meal
of
fruit
or
salad
not
a
complicated
beer
just
something
good
to
drink
when
it
is
hot
nice
drinking
blueberry
brew
a
nice
offering
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
fruity
ale
this
beer
looks
like
an
american
macro
poured
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
fair
of
course
it
smells
like
blueberries
the
taste
is
of
blueberries
with
a
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
diminished
because
of
this
bite
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
many
of
these
there
are
much
better
offerings
from
sweetwater
i
will
choose
one
of
those
next
time
tasting
this
beer
was
a
surprise
i
wasnt
expecting
much
since
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
actually
good
the
fruit
taste
isnt
very
overpowering
in
fact
i
dont
even
notice
it
much
at
all
a
malty
taste
which
isnt
too
malty
its
a
well
balanced
and
suprisingly
good
beer
if
youre
looking
specifically
for
a
blueberry
beer
i
think
sea
dog
is
a
better
option
it
taste
more
like
blueberries
this
taste
more
like
beer
ok
i
know
another
fruit
beer
but
is
good
i
promise
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
white
small
carbo
head
not
very
impressive
but
its
an
ok
looking
beer
smells
yeasty
with
good
scents
of
blueberry
has
a
sweet
yeasty
profile
with
lots
of
blueberry
flavor
slighlty
tart
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
very
good
drinkable
beer
next
to
sea
dog
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
hate
that
its
not
distrubuted
to
charlotte
whats
that
all
about

pours
a
half
finger
nearly
white
head
over
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
colored
liquid
looks
like
a
macro
or
light
lager
smells
like
blueberry
skins
but
also
a
bit
mediciney
tastes
of
blueberry
meat
cherry
without
the
sour
a
hint
of
winey
and
acrid
from
carbonation
ill
be
kind
and
say
theres
a
hint
of
honey
sweet
from
the
malt
but
honestly
this
beer
is
all
about
the
blueberry
and
its
not
quite
natural
tasting
its
not
completely
medicine
like
a
homebrew
i
once
flavored
with
cherry
extract
light
body
and
overly
carbonated
an
interesting
beer
not
bad
not
one
to
thats
going
to
make
you
salivate
thanks
for
the
blue
cokes
even
though
ive
had
a
few
sips
of
one
of
my
brothers
favorite
beers
and
did
not
care
for
it
i
went
ahead
and
ordered
a
bottle
myself
last
night
while
staying
dry
from
tropical
storm
cindy
last
night
in
atlanta
its
better
than
middleburys
counterpart
but
still
just
okay
could
this
not
be
a
touch
of
blue
in
appearance
for
aesthetic
purposes
too
clear
and
crisp
in
my
opinion
not
too
overwhelming
in
smell
or
taste
the
ladies
at
my
table
did
enjoy
it
however
you
may
be
able
to
get
a
few
converts
with
this
one
begins
with
a
pils
like
maltiness
cracker
dry
and
light
perhaps
a
minor
flourish
of
wheatinduced
lemon
then
its
onto
blueberries
and
spun
sugar
its
far
from
oversweet
its
body
so
light
its
nearly
frail
and
for
those
that
enjoy
the
fruit
as
i
do
it
can
be
a
voracious
quaff
buts
its
seems
that
it
is
better
enjoyed
while
preoccupied
with
other
pleasures
it
pales
when
taken
alone
body
is
bordering
watery
thin
and
lifeless
i
would
however
quaff
this
on
a
hot
afternoon
when
something
very
light
is
called
for
drinkable
just
not
overly
desirable
get
a
six
pack
for
your
girlfriend
and
snag
one
or
two
for
yourself
slightly
hazy
yellow
gold
in
hue
with
no
further
color
development
damn
i
wanted
the
liquid
to
be
blue
oh
well
the
head
was
white
in
color
at
the
zenith
the
foam
was
one
finger
in
height
in
a
split
second
it
dissipated
to
a
very
thin
collar
that
was
basically
naked
in
the
middle
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
disappointing
this
beer
is
nothing
special
to
look
at
the
nose
is
dead
on
if
this
was
uncooked
blueberry
muffin
mix
the
blueberries
dont
smell
fresh
or
real
yet
they
dont
smell
so
fake
im
repulsed
soft
grainy
notes
are
also
in
play
the
potency
is
low
and
so
is
the
complexity
the
bouquet
doesnt
say
much
at
all
it
is
not
offensive
but
it
is
not
inviting
rather
hohum
the
palate
is
more
rounded
than
the
nose
maltier
too
i
get
a
big
blast
of
grains
just
like
i
did
in
the
bouquet
interestingly
the
blueberry
flavor
is
very
weak
i
can
find
it
at
the
back
but
it
gets
lost
in
this
beer
what
does
it
get
lost
in
you
may
ask
im
not
sure
because
there
isnt
much
going
on
here
this
is
a
brewpub
quality
throwaway
fruit
beer
ubiquitous
the
palate
has
some
flavor
but
it
is
odd
and
not
that
special
there
is
a
cakelike
sweetness
that
while
soft
is
not
working
for
me
also
im
burping
blueberries
which
is
not
as
cool
as
burping
hops
the
palate
is
inoffensive
and
undeveloped
lackluster
mediumlight
in
body
with
low
but
natural
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
very
fitting
for
this
beer
i
could
see
this
beer
being
liked
by
a
good
number
of
people
maybe
not
ba
types
i
could
also
see
this
beer
being
hated
by
a
good
number
of
people
maybe
ba
types
to
me
this
beer
is
just
okay
i
guess
it
would
work
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
but
a
glass
of
water
might
work
better
maybe
this
beer
would
be
nice
on
a
4th
july
picnic
with
some
fruit
pie
maybe
that
would
be
futile
it
is
more
beery
than
fruity
thanks
to
au1sec
for
the
bottle
ive
want
to
try
is
oddity
for
a
while
my
curiosity
is
quenched
one
was
enough
for
me
i
had
high
hopes
for
sweetwater
blue
after
giving
it
a
few
sniffs
although
it
isnt
the
killer
blueberry
ale
that
im
in
search
of
and
have
yet
to
find
it
isnt
a
bad
little
summer
brew
a
little
sugar
and
a
little
spice
would
spiff
it
up
considerably
thanks
to
au1sec
for
the
bottle
this
is
a
good
one
to
quench
your
thirst
with
as
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
pleasant
if
lindemanns
made
a
blueberry
lambic
this
is
what
i
imagine
it
would
taste
like
albeit
a
bit
less
tart
taste
is
of
light
wheat
malt
blueberry
flavors
and
only
lightly
sweet
and
a
tartness
the
smell
did
not
hint
at
light
bodied
a
bit
thin
sweet
in
the
aftertaste
but
again
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
i
would
have
guessed
not
a
bad
blueberry
ale
better
than
i
gave
it
credit
for
but
still
just
a
dull
wheat
beer
with
some
extract
in
it
not
the
greatest
fruit
beer
and
not
my
favorite
from
sweetwater
but
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
staw
yellow
color
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
nice
ring
of
head
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
though
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
made
fromwith
blueberries
is
instantly
noticeable
in
the
smell
it
wont
knock
you
down
but
you
can
definately
tell
its
got
blue
berries
in
it
very
lightly
carbonated
which
makes
for
really
easy
drinking
the
taste
is
well
of
blue
berries
and
then
a
slightly
biscuity
aftertaste
man
i
could
pound
these
damn
things
all
night
good
taste
easy
drinkin
this
is
certainly
a
session
beer
and
i
will
buy
more
of
this
in
the
future
poured
out
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
similar
to
a
pilsner
faint
aroma
of
blueberries
tastes
crisp
and
refreshing
but
with
a
funky
blueberry
perfumy
quality
that
is
annoying
also
can
taste
grainy
maltyness
unfortunately
they
forgot
to
put
much
hops
in
here
to
create
any
semblance
of
balance
this
is
definitely
the
worst
from
sweetwater
ive
had
i
should
mention
that
this
one
is
one
month
past
the
best
if
enjoyed
by
date
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
leaves
very
little
lacing
but
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rush
to
the
top
of
the
glass
trying
to
get
my
attention
aroma
is
tart
berry
but
only
slight
blueberry
some
biscuit
and
earthy
yeast
are
also
present
as
are
some
faint
citrus
and
piney
hops
taste
is
well
carbonated
very
tart
with
berry
and
has
some
earthy
yeast
notes
and
wheatgrain
this
isnt
so
bad
but
is
not
one
of
sweetwaters
better
offerings
i
look
forward
to
visiting
my
old
haunts
in
atlanta
this
summer
when
the
state
of
georgia
hopefully
will
allow
their
microbreweries
to
turn
out
some
bigger
beers
im
certain
that
sweetwater
will
be
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
unchained
tasted
011004
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
finely
carbonated
white
head
that
recedes
in
a
minute
or
two
and
remains
on
the
top
of
the
beer
for
the
duration
the
aroma
is
very
perfumy
with
a
hint
of
blueberries
the
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
and
blocks
out
any
intricacies
in
the
maltiness
a
slight
hint
of
blueberries
manages
to
sneak
in
there
before
disappearing
again
it
reappears
even
more
faintly
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
lightbodied
drinkability
is
below
my
average
for
sweetwater
brewing
company
if
you
accidentally
allow
the
beer
to
warm
greatly
the
perfuminess
of
the
brew
is
overpowering

right
up
there
with

blueberry

this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
gold
gold
color
and
formed
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left

as
it
subsided
an
aroma

the
flavor
was
of
hops
with
a
hint
of
blueberry
but
finishes
with
a
grainwheat
style
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
i
think
our
local
brewer
barleys
does
a
better
job
with
their
raspberry
wheat
than
what
they
are
trying
to
accomplish
here
what
a
great
fruit
beer
the
beer
has
a
nose
of
blueberry
with
hints
of
hops
and
traces
of
malt
the
color
is
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
consistent
of
a
wheat
brew
with
a
small
white
head
the
taste
is
that
of
blueberry
muffins
which
is
what
you
would
expect
of
a
blueberry
wheat
beer
the
finish
has
subtle
malt
and
very
light
hops
with
i
think
help
to
keep
the
sweetness
of
the
blueberries
in
check
very
drinkable
fruit
beer
without
too
much
sweetness
i
agree
with
uglyradios
assessment
in
that
i
could
not
drink
this
all
the
time
but
i
wouldnt
drink
any
fruit
beer
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
very
passable

beer

of

something
that
excites
me
much
not
really
the
best
beer
some
chill
haze
and
a
weak
head
one
eyebrow
went
up
when
i
took
a
whiff
interesting
blueberry
aroma
with
something
pungent
in
the
background
not
sure
what
maybe
some
yeast
has
a
distinctive
blueberry
flavor
but
i
agree
it
doesnt
taste
natural
no
bitterness
at
all
there
is
a
very
faint
floral
almost
perfumey
flavor
in
the
background
perhaps
a
feable
attempt
to
achieve
complexity
fizzy
and
no
real
aftertaste
this
may
be
for
some
but
not
for
me
keep
trying
sweetwater
this
beer
is
horrible
take
a
bag
of
jiffy
blueberry
muffin
mix
and
turn
it
into
a
beer
the
jiffy
muffins
are
only
barely
edible
to
start
with
and
when
theyre
turned
into
beer
its
undrinkable
i
couldnt
finish
the
freaking
pint
it
was
just
gross
they
say
they
use
fresh
blueberries
but
it
tastes
like
the
fake
stuff
this
beer
really
pissed
me
off
the
smell
is
ok
though
but
imagine
a
budweiser
a
little
darker
with
a
slight
greenish
tint
from
the
blueberries
horrible
horrible
beer
adbsolutely
incredibe
so
sweet
like
cherry
juice
cuveebrut
is
quite
dry
and
tart
like
a
champagne
with
a
cherry
after
taste
by
far
my
favorite
beer
in
this
style
very
nice
punchy
soury
taste
it
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
if
youre
not
to
keen
on
sour
things
but
then
again
you
probably
wouldnt
be
drinking
this
beer
if
you
were
tart
yet
sweet
good
tasting
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
was
very
fruity
just
as
i
expected
but
the
it
still
had
a
little
bit
of
complexity
to
it
and
that
made
for
a
pretty
tasty
dessert
beer
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
refreshing
not
too
acidic
not
overly
sweet
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
a
whole
bottle
might
be
a
little
too
much
for
me
but
a
couple
glasses
of
it
would
be
nice
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
and
it
was
a
little
complex
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
just
wasnt
a
great
looking
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
cherry
beers
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
i
was
expected
it
to
be
overly
sweet
and
it
wasnt
i
really
liked
that
and
the
added
complexity
was
nice
this
made
for
a
good
first
impression
for
this
brewery
and
its
one
of
the
better
cherry
beers
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
beer
keep
up
the
hard
work
dark
amberruby
color
dense
haze
blocks
most
light
sweet
cherry
aroma
fresh
cherries
hit
the
tongue
right
away
mostly
sweet
and
only
mildly
tart
almost
no
hop
character
just
the
slightest
hints
of
wood
in
the
finish
extremely
well
balanced
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
sticky
from
the
sugars
sharp
snappy
carbonation
adds
a
dryness
to
the
finish
to
contrast
the
fruit
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
everything
is
so
well
put
together
in
this
one
that
i
just
cant
put
my
glass
down
this
would
be
a
great
beer
with
just
about
any
dessert
especially
those
made
with
chocolate
or
berries
2011
vintage
from
bottle
pours
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
has
a
reddish
hue
to
it
smells
very
strongly
of
cherries
with
a
hint
of
other
dark
fruits
and
earthiness
in
the
background
taste
is
very
tart
cherry
hard
to
describe
as
it
is
a
strong
taste
of
cherry
but
mellow
at
the
same
time
there
is
some
darkness
to
the
taste
too
in
the
end
like
plums
and
figs
but
the
cherry
is
the
star
here
the
mouthfeel
is
way
above
average
for
a
fruit
beer
it
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
not
highly
carbonated
a
great
aspect
of
this
beer
at
first
i
was
worried
that
i
picked
up
a
3
year
old
fruit
beer
but
this
came
out
very
well
the
cherries
toned
down
and
some
of
the
oud
bruin
came
out
simply
delicious
out
of
curiosity
i
think
corresponds
to
the
proposal
but
i
saw
no
difference
with
a
champagne
cooler
or
cheaper
appearance
inviting
bottle
with
paper
wrapper
in
translucent
red
glass
with
little
foam
but
persistent
aroma
here
i
remembered
some
beer
because
the
malt
appears
slightly
taste
sweet
actually
has
cherry
leaves
an
aftertaste
of
malt
and
sweet

despite
the
6
alcohol
did
not
find

its

its

but
its

too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
know
its
not
a
fullon
sour
beer
so
the
rating
will
be
given
considering
usual
belgian
fruit
beers
o
if
you
like
tart
krieks
you
will
like
this
overall
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
at
a
local
pub
called
pale
nine
ale
house
in
san
diego
this
was
the
beer
that
developed
my
love
for
sour
beers
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
refreshing
change
from
most
other
beers
it
is
the
perfect
combination
of
sour
tastes
and
fruity
tastes
for
me
overall
a
pure
pleasure
to
drink
actually
gets
you
excited
and
remarkably
it
doesnt
tire
with
all
the
sugar
a
credit
to
the
excellent
carbonation
get
your
hands
on
this
that
one
important
blip
notwithstanding
its
hard
not
to
champion
liefmans
cuvée
brut
as
an
exceptionally
delicious
example
of
this
wonderfully
complex
distinct
style
anyone
that
doesnt
enjoy
this
beer
must
be
just
plain
miserable
that
being
said
i
too
would
opt
for
the
more
traditional
read
unsweetened
version
probably
8
times
out
of
10
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
with
lots
of
intense
sweet
but
real
not
syrupy
fruit
flavor
with
a
sour
backbone
keeping
things
in
check
complex
and
very
approachable
for
a
sour
beer
highly
recommended
overall
well
it
isnt
a
new
glarus
fruit
beer
but
its
similar
too
sweet
though
overall
i
am
very
happy
i
grabbed
this
bottle
on
a
whim
its
very
good
and
im
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
has
any
interest
in
fruit
flavored
brews
of
any
sort
tartly
sweet
cherries
came
across
flavorwise
with
an
easygoing
finish
cherries
all
the
way
4
0
d
this
is
pretty
flavourful
and
leans
to
the
sweet
side
but
with
a
nice
natural
cherry
flavour
to
it
this
went
down
pretty
easily
with
a
pleasant
albeit
slight
balsamic
tartness
o
an
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
the
tartness
quite
a
bit
but
there
were
times
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
that
being
said
i
think
my
beer
was
pretty
young
and
i
will
be
interested
to
try
it
again
in
a
few
years
overall
nice
fruity
notes
and
a
tart
finish
but
just
a
little
too
sweet
to
enjoy
in
large
quantities
the
best
before
date
is
2023
so
maybe
some
age
will
tone
down
the
sweetness
i
will
report
back
in
10
years
o
2112
vintage
hard
to
drink
had
to
choke
it
down
what
we
could
and
pour
out
the
rest
it
was
entirely
too
sweet
it
wasnt
clean
tasting
and
proper
acidity
was
just
not
there
o
a
solid
sour
cherry
though
i
prefer
the
goudenband
theres
a
good
balance
of
tart
sour
and
sweet
in
this
this
is
better
than
any
cherry
soda
ive
ever
had
if
your
crazy
for
cherries
with
an
abv
you
gotta
pull
the
trigger
on
this
dynamic
and
strong
resonating
with
complexity
and
character
o
much
better
than
the
appearance
and
aroma
indicated
this
is
a
2
year
old
bottle
still
taste
cherry
nicely
the
tartness
is
very
mild
and
works
well
with
the
sweet
dark
cherry
flavor
no
flavor
in
here
overwhelms
the
other
and
sweet
and
tart
are
harmonized
nicely
real
nice
stuff
the
taste
is
a
lot
more
like
a
legitimate
beer
than
the
fruitesse
but
it
has
a
very
sweet
almost
artificial
tasting
finish
tart
cherry
juice
sour
cherries
and
sour
grapes
start
out
in
charge
then
quickly
give
in
to
a
fake
from
concentrate
cherry
juice
taste
with
too
much
sweetness
not
bad
but
definitely
not
on
the
level
of
the
goudenband
too
bad
overall

remember
that
when

session

thats

9
4
ounces
in

sitting
highly
recommended
for
all
kriek
heads
not
the
best
from
kriek
week
but
darn
close
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
short
and
quickly
thinning
head
tops
this
brown
elixir
it
smells
like
rhubarb
and
has
a
taste
to
match
the
taste
to
be
more
precise
is
that
of
rhubarb
pie
including
the
delightful
mitigating
sweetness
of
the
sugary
aspect
of
the
filling
and
the
crust
what
southern
tiers
pumking
is
to
pumpkin
pie
this
brew
is
to
its
rhubarb
counterpart
with
a
certain
sour
cherry
cast
a
fun
concoction
with
the
characteristics
of
a
dessert
for
a
sophisticated
palate
the
refreshing
character
of
the
carbonation
is
just
right
overall
im
disappointed
to
see
that
this
is
classified
as
a
fruit
beer

just
a
tasty
beer
not
a
huge
complexity
from
the
base
flanders
ale
its
a
bit
coating
with
good
dusty
basement
aroma
over
the
fruit
and
spice
this
is
a
legitimate
fruit
lambic
that
pairs
the
funk
and
tart
feel
of
belgian
wild
yeast
with
sweet
and
juicy
fruit
the
end
result
is
a
pleasant
light
and
sharp
carbonation
provides
a
certain
freshness

5very
impressive
for
what
it
is
as
i
enjoy
blueberry
muffins
syrup
buckle
etc
i
also
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
for
everyone
but
tasty
and
fairly
crisp
not
for
everyone
but
for
those
who
really
do
not
like
the
bitterness
of
most
beers
this
is
great
way
to
go
yes
it
is
sweet
yes
it
does
really
taste
like
blueberries
with
a
little
beer
in
the
background
compared
to
other
blueberry
ales
that
taste
like
90
beer
with
a
little
blueberry
put
in
just
to
say
it
is
there
for
me
that
is
much
preferable
to
those
fake
blueberry
ales
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
is
remarkably
refreshing
however
be
careful
not
to
forget
it
is
an
8
brew
and
if
you
down
it
like
a
soda
or
fruit
drink
it
will
kick
you
anheuserbusch
got
it
right
kind
of
sweet
and
has
a
terrible
color
im
a
woman
and
i
thought
this
fruity
beer
was
gross
i
had
to
pour
it
out
the
potential
buzz
off
the
8
couldnt
convince
me
to
choke
it
down
im
sad
for
this
beer
gives
you
a
decent
buzz
due
to
alcohol
content
but
has
a
bitter
taste
if
its
natural
flavor
why
does
it
taste
like
a
popsicle
at
first
i
recoiled
at
the
initial
shock
of
this
swill
hitting
my
taste
buds
my
palate
having
not
enough
time
to
recover
from
this
horror
proceeded
to
endure
several
agonizing
seconds
as
i
mustered
up
the
courage
to
ingest
such
misery
and
then
came
the
aftertaste
which
i
can
only
describe
as
tasting
like
how
sadness
feels
wild
blue
exists
without
my
consent
interesting
but
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
had
i
not
read
the
bottle
i
would
have
thought
it
was
a
wine
cooler
wild
blue
dont
try
this
again
a
very
solid
beer
for
people
who
cant
palate
beer
also
very
dangerous
because
if
you
were
like
me
you
didnt
realize
it
was
8
abv
until
after
drinking
3
of
them
so
this
was
in
the
premium
section
near
all
the
locals
and
the
sierra
nevadas
and
etc
did
not
realise
it
was
ab
schwill
8
percent
eh
so
basically
im
figuring
they
brew
some
adjunct
high
gravity
crap
then
pour
in
some
high
fructose
chemical
blueberry
shit
and
wham
there
ya
have
it
kinda
misleading
packaging
and
website
i
expected
a
craft
beer
with
some
light
fruit
notes
i
got
gypped
by
macro
garbage
gmo
fructose
headache
here
i
come
its
koolaid
masquerading
as
beer
at
best
will
give
you
cavities
at
worst
will
give
you
diabetes
so
ab
makes
this
stuff
but
its
so
bad
they
dont
put
there
name
anywhere
on
the
bottle
too
sweet
i
dont
waste
beer
i
drank
them
all
and
theyll
get
you
pretty
lit
but
this
is
some
of
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
tastes
and
smells
great
just
a
little
strong
want
to
get
drunk
real
fast
then
drink
this
juice
its
not
beer
its
a
high
abv
juice
despite
the
hating
here
this
was
tasty
as
heck
pours
blue
with
a
finger
of
blue
head
which
both
retains
and
laces
aroma
is
blueberry
taste
is
blueberry
lack
of
booziness
at
8
is
fantastic
and
sweetness
is
nice
girly
or
not
this
stuff
is
fantastic
pours
purplered
with
thin
head
and
modest
bubbles
lots
of
blueberry
aroma
as
you
might
expect
with
some
tartness
and
malt
notes
tastes
like
fizzy
koolaid
with
a
little
spice
too
sweet
smells
extremely
sweet
with
an
offputting
blueberry
scent
smells
way
too
smeet
and
alcohol
the
main
off
putter
for
me
was
the
texture
of
this
thing
it
almost
tastes
like
syrup
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
pours
a
dark
purple
with
a
blueish
hued
head
the
smell
was
very
heavy
with
alcohol
the
taste
was
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
way
too
sweet
with
heavy
alcohol
burn
the
texture
was
also
far
too
syrupy
for
me
not
a
fan
its
ok
only
good
for
a
couple
swigs
though
pours
with
a
small
purple
head
looks
just
like
grape
juice
has
an
aroma
of
blueberries
malts
and
alcohol
that
combines
to
create
a
slightly
unpleasant
aroma
initial
taste
is
sweet
from
the
blueberries
but
aftertaste
is
bitter
from
the
combination
of
malts
and
alcohol
overall
a
poor
beer
but
i
have
had
worse
very
very
bad
had
once
a
couple
years
ago
it
really
isnt
good
dark
blue
color
is
offsetting
horrible
fruit
beer
that
would
be
ok
as
a
shot
but
not
in
a
12oz
serving
pleasant
blueberry
syrup
that
gets
old
very
quick
it
was
overly
sweet
and
tough
to
get
through
a
good
beer
for
college
students
that
want
something
sweet
with
a
high
alcohol
content
for
me
it
was
a
drain
pour
sweet
and
crisp
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
it
was
very
bluepurple
and
claims
to
have
juice
which
leads
me
to
want
it
to
be
considered
a
shandy
i
dont
know
if
there
is
any
beer
rules
that
say
it
cant
be
a
shandy
but
it
was
too
sweet
for
me
to
call
a
lager
great
beer
to
get
drunk
on
being
8
and
tasting
like
lightly
carbonated
juice
no
bitter
flavors
during
or
after
conumption
dont
let
the
kids
near
it
this
is
pretty
much
a
less
flavorful
version
of
grape
soda
not
sure
i
would
even
classify
this
as
a
beer
blue
berry
lager
very
difficult
to
execute
this
is
so
much
better
served
over
ice
i
was
offered
a
taste
by
my
father
and
didnt
think
it
was
that
bad
not
that
good
though
nice
fruity
aroma
with
a
somewhat
more
stolid
outward
appearance
the
taste
is
decent
but
not
as
profound
as
the
initial
flavor
smooth
dark
blue
color
sickly
sweet
taste
its
good
when
you
just
wanna
get
drunk
and
not
drink
beer
why
do
i
have
to
give
it
a
review
i
can
understand
why
some
hard
core
purists
would
dislike
this
beer
its
sweet
and
does
remind
you
of
a
grape
soda
but
i
liked
it
my
wife
loved
it
at
8
it
has
a
nice
kick
and
i
get
to
enjoy
the
taste
of
blueberries
first
sip
of
this
lager
is
nothing
like
what
you
probably
expected
when
you
ventured
out
to
give
this
new
concept
of
brew
a
try
the
taste
from
beginning
to
end
is
somewhat
of
a
dull
blueberry
soda
that
has
been
overwhelmed
by
syrup
the
only
reason
i
gave
it
a
2
star
rating
is
becausefor
some
reason
despite
this
taste
description
it
is
bearable
to
drink
as
a
carbonated
malt
beverage
but
completely
unrelatable
to
beer
and
any
classic
lager
brews
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
had
several
sitting
by
the
pool
i
recommend
this
for
a
summer
outing
cough
syrup
meets
beer
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
stuff
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
but
after
3
swings
i
was

wife
bought
me
this
awful
too
sweetafter
taste
will
not
buy
again
i
will
stick
to
busch
light
it
tastes
like
cough
syrup
both
on
the
palate
and
in
the
aftertaste
its
simply
shocking
ive
long
clamored
for
a
blueberry
beer
that
is
so
intensely
blueberry
that
it
pours
purple
and
thought
that
this
might
be
the
answer
to
my
prayers
but
no
a
higherthanexpected
abv
8
gives
it
some
super
slight
merit
but
it
cant
save
the
beer
overall
id
recommend
steering
clear
rjt
this
is
my
wifes
favorite
beer
and
i
make
a
great
effort
to
never
run
out
of
of
wild
blue
one
wild
blue
and
my
wife
is
happy
and
when
shes
happy
she
is
always
in
the
mood
to
make
me
happy
anyone
who
gives
this
brew
a
bad
score
does
so
because
it
is
an
unconventional
beer
flavor
it
tastes
like
the
blue
berries
it
is
made
from
the
flavor
is
so
intense
that
i
am
not
ashamed
to
admit
that
i
enjoy
this
girly
beer
but
then
i
love
blueberry
pie
watered
down
grape
juice
watered
down
grape
juice
oh
sorry
you
were
waiting
for
my
review
if
you
are
looking
for
some
mild
juice
to
go
with
your
breakfast
or
something
to
quench
the
thirst
real
fast
this
is
it
beer
i
do
not
think
so
oh
well
not
horrible
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
if
you
need
a
blueberry
fix
dark
horse
tres
blueberry
stout
will
blow
your
mind
why
is
wild
blue
no
longer
being
distributed
in
minneapolis
minnesota
its
my
alltime
favorite
and
i
cant
find
it
anywhere
anymore
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
blueberries
yum
this
is
not
a
2
18
beer
even
if
you
do
not
like
sweet
beers
it
cannot
be
that
bad
the
purple
color
is
interesting
and
the
fact
that
this
is
an
8
abv
is
impressive
in
and
of
itself
flavor
is
good
if
i
can
point
to
a
flaw
it
might
be
the
lack
of
head
and
carbonation
owned
by
them
very
sweet
so
if
you
dont
like
a
sweet
kick
in
your
ass
dont
buy
it
wild
blue
is
one
of
the
better
fruitflavored
beers
that
ive
had
and
will
get
you
where
youre
goingif
you
arent
going
too
far
you
can
really
taste
the
blue
berry
in
it
it
is
very
fruity
overall
this
beer
is
kinda
cool
everything
from
the
color
to
the
flavor
to
the
layyouonyourass
abv
is
pretty
neat
its
worth
a
try
and
not
half
as
bad
as
some
of
these
folks
claim
it
to
be
i
have
to
laugh
when
they
talk
about
german
and
american
hops
in
the
beer
really
where
did
they
go
a
ratio
of
99
malt
and
1
hops
doesnt
really
equate
to
much
there
are
no
hops
to
be
detected
12
oz
bottle
in
a
glass
pours
purple
like
a
grape
soda
head
and
all
head
and
lacing
are
nonexistent
after
a
few
seconds
though
surprised
to
see
it
was
anheuserbusch
that
brewed
such
an
experimental
beer
in
my
opinion
a
true
craft
beer
pushes
the
limit
against
tradition
and
this
blueberry
lager
seems
to
aspire
to
do
that
but
the
smell
is
more
on
the
artificial
grape
side
than
natural
blueberry
surprisingly
the
taste
is
light
sugary
and
juicelike
even
with
8
abv
reminds
me
of
those
nasty
fruit
flavored
md
2020
liquors
they
sell
at
the
gas
station
lots
of
carbonation
very
sweet
fruity
and
no
hops
strange
aftertaste
there
is
definitely
room
for
improvement
and
this
style
is
not
for
everyone
perhaps
they
should
have
put
the
blueberry
flavor
in
the
background
and
brought
out
more
wheat
and
hops
to
the
surface
so
that
it
actually
tastes
like
a
beer
i
wont
buy
another
one
this
is
what
youre
gonna
want
by
the
way
at
first
i
thought
wild
blue
was
brewed
by
flying
dog
because
of
the
artwork
and
font
on
the
bottle
and
pack
four
in
30
does
the
mind
good
the
people
who
dont
like
this
beer
generally
just
dont
like
sweet
beers
this
drink
is
delicious
and
tastes
like
a
blueberry
soda
careful
though
its
8
but
you
wouldnt
know
it
by
drinking
it
ive
had
a
lot
of
different
beers
and
this
one
is
by
far
my
favorite
everyone
has
their
goto
beer
and
this
one
is
mine
unfortunately
its
really
expensive
to
drink
every
night
so
you
might
wanna
keep
this
one
for
some
weekends
or
special
occasions
o
pretty
disgusting
not
sure
this
is
beer

this
is
just
one
bad
excuse
of
a
lager
the
alcohol
does
not
mesh
its
almost
like
it
was
fortified
with
alcohol
the
alcohol
should
complement
the
beer
and
be
part
of
the
taste
experience
i
have
5
12
bottles
of
this
stuff
left
and
dont
know
what
to
do
with
it
if
this
was
blue
moon
you
should
avoid
this
beer
by
all
means
there
are
just
too
many
other
great
beers
out
there
to
try

would

again
though
mostly
just

i
like
how
the
commercial
description
makes
sure
to
mention
hops
and
malts
cuz
you
wouldnt
know
they
were
present
otherwise
a
kiddie
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
and
sugary
similar
to
a
blueberry
soda
that
has
gone
flat
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
which
is
its
only
saving
grace
not
appealing
couldnt
or
wouldnt
drink
another
one
even
one
has
its
challenges
to
start
with
i
adore
blueberries
fresh
ripe
and
real
blueberries
that
is
nonetheless
this
nehi
grapecolored
debacle
may
say
it
contains
natural
flavors
and
colors
it
went
down
smooth
but
for
being
a
blue
berry
they
put
blueberries
in
it
and
they
dance
around
like
a
lava
lamp
this
is
definitely
the
best
blueberry
beer
id
had
had
at
least
6
it
holds
its
taste
to
the
very
end
of
the
bottle
i
got
a
few
cases
from
sneiders
for
30
case
they
also
sell
it
at
yes
and
would
have
never
guessed
it
was
an
ab
product
the
smell
is
good
lots
of
fresh
i
dislike
busch
i
live
in
stl
it
is
not
for
everyone
obviously
after
sessions
with
with
one
now
twice
d
i
wont
buy
this
for
myself
again
though
i
can
understand
that
fans
of
wine
coolersflavored
malt
beverages
would
probably
enjoy
this
picked
up
a
sixer
the
local
store
i
actually
was
going
for
the
sn
celeration
ale
which
they
where
fresh
out
of
and
this
caught
my
eye
says
on
the
carton
that
they
won
a
gold
medal
what
a
laugh
this
is
not
beer
its
more
like
rancid
fruit
juice
laced
with
alc
i
will
never
buy
another
ab
product
again
in
my
life
as
this
product
is
a
insult
stay
away
the
head
looked
pretty
ridiculous
thin
and
bright
bubble
gum
pink
i
gave
it
a
good
drinkability
rating
because
it
doesnt
seem
like
8
despite
alcohol
being
up
front
in
the
flavor
other
than
that
it
made
me
think
of
dimetapp
mixed
with
vodka
syrupy
and
sickeningly
sweet
yuck
although
this
beer
has
gotten
bad
review
from
most
of
the
users
on
this
site
i
was
exceptionally
pleased
with
the
overall
taste
of
this
beer
yes
it
is
a
sweet
beer
and
yes
it
is
a
bit
overpowering
but
i
tend
to
think
this
can
be
a
good
thing
from
time
to
time
it
really
depends
on
the
overall
users
taste
i
myself
am
a
big
fan
of
blueberries
and
to
find
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
lucious
and
sweet
blueberry
that
pops
in
your
mouth
as
you
eat
it
i
think
that
this
beer
has
been
unfairly
rated
in
most
aspects
i
think
of
this
beer
as
more
of
a
lambic
than
anything
if
you
are
looking
for
a
retreat
from
the
more
servitude
koscher
beer
flavors
than
this
beer
is
for
you
its
definately
not
your
average
beer
but
as
fruit
flavored
beers
go
it
definitely
promises
more
flavor
than
your
average
sam
adams
cherry
lambic
dont
expect
this
beer
to
be
your
normal
beer
flavor
but
dont
discount
it
for
being
too
fruity
who
knows
you
may
like
it
i
did
this
is
100
malternative
and
an
especially
vile
one
not
beer
get
it
outta
here
d
tough
to
handle
took
almost
an
hour
to
get
one
down
while
cleansing
my
palate
with
a
better
beer
i
just
didt
want
to
waste
the
alcohol
that
was
presented
to
me
taste
this
is
reminiscent
of
the
sparkling
fruit
juices
out
there
that
have
no
alcohol
or
even
a
malt
liquor
or
pop
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
taste
at
all
it
is
not
like
other
people
say
that
it
is
undrinkable
but
it
is
not
what
you
would
want
if
you
were
looking
for
a
beer
this
is
a
cheap
beer
with
artificial
flavoring
one
of
the
first
beers
my
friend
bought
when
he
turned
21
three
months
ago
and
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
is
still
sitting
in
the
fridge
awful
d
its
flavorful
but
only
from
the
blueberry
extract
and
not
very
tasty
does
not
go
down
very
easily
but
at
least
its
not
too
filling
strong
kick
but
it
just
makes
a
bad
beer
worse
this
beer
is
just
plain
awful
the
taste
is
simply
fruit
juice
with
some
alcohol
in
it
no
beer
like
qualities
to
it
at
al
for
me
and
the
8abv
i
didnt
feel
anything
from
it
at
all
so
drinking
this
beer
was
a
complete
waste
of
its
share
of
the
mixed
sixer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
dark
purple
with
a
light
purple
head
that
left
a
slight
cap
the
aroma
is
of
blueberries
really
the
color
and
smell
is
what
i
would
expect
for
a
blueberry
beer
so
average
in
my
book
the
taste
however
is
like
a
cheap
malt
liquor
beverage
you
would
give
to
your
high
school
girlfriend
back
when
you
were
in
high
school
because
she
wouldnt
drink
a
tall
boy
with
you
and
your
friends
very
sugary
taste
overly
tart
and
fruity
i
cant
even
get
my
wife
to
finish
this
best
use
reduce
it
and
pour
it
over
vanilla
ice
cream
such
would
be
its
only
purpose
please
this
is
a
joke
no
i
believe
this
to
be
a
poor
attempt
at
lambic
style
brew
if
thats
what
they
were
going
for
ouch
i
will
not
be
recommending
this
to
my
friends
however
i
will
try
to
finish
the
drink
ive
poured
thanks
rob
this
is
a
neat
beer
its
a
sweet
beer
works
great
for
hop
and
bitter
beer
haters
if
you
like
sa
cherry
wheat
you
wont
be
sorry
you
tried
this
overall
going
against
the
curve
here
a
bit
but
this
is
my
straight
up
opinion
would
have
never
known
this
was
a
ab
product
if
it
wasnt
for
ba
although
it
doesnt
hit
the
lager
title
head
on
its
definately
welcomed
as
it
is
quite
tasty
and
smooth
looking
for
a
lager
then
look
elsewhere
but
if
you
want
a
decent
sweet
blueberry
beer
with
a
moderate
abv
then
this
will
be
your
pick
bought
a
sixpack
from
the
supermarket
with
a
girl
who
loves
beer
as
much
as
i
do
took
it
home
and
poured
it
into
pint
glasses
it
pours
a
clearishpurple
with
effervescent
bubbles
and
only
a
little
bit
of
whiteish
head
sparse
lacing
around
the
rim
as
i
poked
my
nose
into
the
glass
for
a
sniff
very
strong
blueberry
smell
followed
by
the
aroma
of
alcohol
according
to
the

this
beer
is
8
abv
the
natural
flavor
read
chemical
flavoring
added
of
blueberry
overpowers
the
normal
hints
of
hops
or
malt
really
this
beer
just
tastes
like
a
punchier
boones
farm
or
an
alcoholic
lolipop
it
should
win
over
people
who
dont
much
like
beer
but
for
a
beer
enthusiast
there
isnt
much
to
like
id
suggest
sweetwater
blue
as
an
alternative
to
this
product
if
youre
interested
in
berry
beer
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
the
beer
pours
a
bluish
tint
not
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
and
not
too
much
of
a
head
it
smells
strongly
of
blueberries
which
isnt
too
bad
until
you
get
to
the
taste
very
fake
very
strong
blueberry
flavor
that
lingers
a
bit
as
well
not
enjoyable
in
the
least
i
didnt
finish
the
beer
this
is
definitely
hangover
material
i
would
avoid
at
all
costs
more
of
a
beer
cooler
or
wine
cooler
than
a
fruit
beer
interesting
to
say
the
least
d
again
its
like
blueberry
pop
so
i
could
have
one
or
two
but
the
abv
and
color
is
the
most
appealing
aspects
of
this
beer
not
good
at
all
but
a
refreshing
beer
for
sure
poured
red
and
gathered
a
pink
head
great
for
us
gals
head
disappeared
quite
quickly
nose
of
bluberries
taste
of
blueberry
champagne
ultra
light
mouthfeel
and
the
8
abv
kicks
in
quickly
just
a
pretty
reddish
beer
champagnelike
aftertaste
and
very
sweet
not
a
beer
to
overload
on
only
a
true
fruity
beer
lover
can
appreciate
this
worth
a
try
the
big
ab
company
is
trying
to
make
a
stake
in
the
micro
brewing
business
not
up
to
my
standards
d
i
would
give
this
beer
a
1
in
this
category
but
the
extra
half
point
goes
to
the
college
boys
who
pick
up
a
6
of
this
for
a
party
in
hopes
of
getting
laid
by
a
helpless
woman
getting
blasted
off
his

fruit
syrup
crap
ugh
appearance
and
smell
had
me
worried
id
have
the
only
nond
or
f
review
until
i
had
my
first
sip
then
i
realized
why
it
was
so
low
beerfmandyaug

but
this
seems
too
artificial
i
kind
of
get
a
hint
of
beer
smell
in
there
it
tastes
sweet
at
first
what
is
wrong
with
me
and
then
dissipates
quickly
tastes
like
a
wine
cooler
although
im
a
pretty
staunch
hophead
and
perhaps
this
beer
has
its
place
in
someone
elses
fridge
i
suppose
i
was
hoping
for
more
beer
essence
and
far
less
fake
fruit
taste
if
one
wanted
to
have
a
beer
like
this
but
i
would
drink
it
again
more
of
a
novelty
drink

enough
almost
sodalike
with

the
taste
is
what
i
imagine
a

would
be
a
big
artificial
candylike
blueberry
blast
that
seems
artificially
sweetened
in
a
lame
attempt
to
cover
up
the
alcohol
on
the
back
end
you
may
have
noticed
that
i
didnt

any

a

who

gave
me
a

leaving

sucks
too
the
aroma
is
nasty
artificially
sweet

the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a

the
blueberry
is
very
sweet

incredibly
overbearing

adds
a
bit
of
a
stickiness
that
doesnt
help
that
at
all
i
find
myself
unable

detect
any
real
beer
qualities
in
it
just
a
heavy
and
syrupy
blueberry
alcohol
the
carbonation
is
that
of
a
big

spritzer
and
after
a

it
gets
to
be
a

much
and
hard
on

not
recommended
at
all
unfortunately
d
well
im
not
even
sure
you
can
call
this
beer
not
really
its
like
a

malternative
on
steroids
the
beer
equivalent
of

yes

why
not

add

just

also

my

a

taste
to
see
if
maybe
a

this
is

sweet
for

and
little
to
nothing
that
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
drinking

i
would
say
go
to
sweetwater

for
more
of
a

less
of

wow
this
is
special
stuff
thanks
russ
can
you
say
wine
cooler
on
steroids
seriously
this
beer
is
very
different
from
anything
else
ive
ever
tasted
very
fruity
a
dominent
taste
of
blueberries
and
other
tart
fruity
flavors
pours
a
deep
reddish
purple
has
a
tart
after
taste
not
very
pleasent
at
all
at
8
abv
its
ease
of
consumption
is
suprisigly
easy
if
youre
looking
for
something
crazy
and
different
give
it
a
try
not
a
beer
in
the
traditional
sense
by
any
means
this
is
not
that
bad
if
you
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
novelty
item
if
youre
just
looking
to
drink
a
good
beer
this
is
not
necessarily
where
to
look
again
if
you
can
get
past
the
fact
that
its
a
novelty
change
of
pace
sort
of
thing
and
not
a
serious
attempt
at
making
a
high
quality
lager
its
a
strangely
refreshing
serviceable
quaff
i
would
however
refrain
from
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
knew
this
beer
would
get
horrible
reviews
on
the
account
that
its
made
by
anheuserbusch
you
beer
snobs
are
so
predictable
however
i
love
blueberries
and
this
is
very
intensely
flavored
with
them
this
is
what
youd
get
if
you
combined
34
beer
with
14
blueberry
schnapps
it
hardly
beer
but
it
is
different
and
satisfies
my
blueberry
craving
quite
nicely
i
doubt
i
could
stomach
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
at
a
time
im
not
even
done
with
the
first
one
and
my
brain
is
already
feeling
slightly
compromised
d
wifey
liked
it
im
worried
about
the
chemicals
from
all
the
natural
flavoring
i
just
ingested
but
the
beer
itself
isnt
too
bad
id
rank
this
much
closer
to
an
alcopop
than
a
beer
actually
as
disgusting
as
hard
lemonades
are
id
probably
take
one
over
this
and
as
it
comes
with
a
premium
beer
pricetag
this
is
one
you
will
be
best
off
avoiding
needless
to
say
i
ended
up
just
throwing
away
the
other
5
i
should
also
make
a
note
here
that
i
did
not
notice
it
was
an
a
b
product
until
after
i
had
finished
it
so
consider
that
a
blind
taste
test
from
a
guy
who
usually
doesnt
enjoy
their
stuff
drinkability
is
blah
this
had
me
at
appearances
but
failed
the
rest
of
the
gamut
first
few
sips
were
easy
the
rest
had
no
problem
going
down
the
drain
least
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
despite
a
decent
smell
my
first
drainpour
i
have
been
weirdly
excited
about
my
first
drainpour
yessss
pours
a
very
reddish
sort
of
color
with
a
very
slight
pink
head
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
more
lager
colored
with
a
blue
tinge
looks
more
like
a
pale
grape
soda
then
a
blueberry
beer
not
bad
looking
just
wasnt
what
was
expected
heavy
fruit
aroma
and
a
very
metallic
smell
to
it
again
more
grape
then
anything
else
a
lot
of
fruit
flavor
but
it
doesnt
define
itself
as
being
blueberry
overly
sweet
tasting
no
trace
of
being
a
beer
at
all
syrupy
sweet
mouthfeeli
can
still
lick
my
lips
and
get
sweetness
5
minutes
after
a
sip
i
would
call
this
a
malt
beverage
before
i
put
the
label
beer
on
it
i
tend
to
love
ab
beersthats
just
me
this
is
nowhere
near
a
beer
i
bet
inbev
gives
this
the
axe
once
the
takeover
is
in
place
not
terriblei
bet
someone
likes
the
stuff
just
not
me
i
have
a
friend
that
loved
this
stuff
so
much
he
called
me
and
told
me
i
had
to
try
it
i
some
in
the
fridge
from
a
mixasix
so
i
tried
it
right
away
i
thought
it
was
alright
but
not
as
great
as
he
did
it
has
a
purple
like
body
with
a
slightly
red
hue
the
head
and
lace
were
kind
of
a
purplefuchsia
color
but
both
were
thin
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
it
smelled
like
blueberries
and
alcohol
sort
of
like
the
cheap
schnapps
that
you
buy
in
a
european
train
station
the
taste
is
about
the
same
it
just
seems
artificial
however
i
do
due
the
oddness
of
this
beer
and
the
alcohol
content
it
is
a
novelty
i
have
to
admit
i
was
not
expecting
this
when
i
first
tried
it
i
have
had
several
blueberryinfused
beers
in
my
day
but
none
this
prominent
it
pours
deep
blueishpurple
just
like
blueberry
juice
with
a
light
purple
head
and
the
aroma
of
blueberry
overwhelms
your
olfactory
senses
on
first
taste
i
thought
i
had
bought
a
soda
not
a
beer
due
to
the
overwhelming
flavor
of
fruit
and
lack
of
beer
i
dont
know
what
all
ingredients
were
used
to
make
this
but
it
tastes
as
if
a
couple
gallons
of
blueberry
juice
were
dumped
into
a
batch
of
brew
on
the
plus
side
it
is
8
alcohol
so
you
wont
regret
the
decision
of
buying
it
for
very
long
pours
a
wine
colored
purplered
color
body
with
a
light
purplish
head
but
smallish
and
diminishing
very
sugary
sweet
aroma
some
blueberry
sodaish
aroma
syrupy
a
mellow
sweet
taste
like
blueberry
soda
hides
the
alcohol
fizzy
okay
overall
a
big
letdown
i
saw
the
cool
bottle
and
8
abv
and
noticed
the
brewery
listed
as
blue
dawg
brewing
turns
out
that
this
is
just
another
ab
craft
poseur
coming
across
more
like
one
of
their
malt
beverages
such
as
sparks
ad
nauseam
rather
than
any
kind
of
premium
lager
with
natural
flavors
sorry
bud
its
another
dud
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
but
if
someone
had
one
to
give
i
might
be
able
to
stomach
one
yeah
its
from
anheuserbusch
but
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
so
got
a
girl
who
dont
like
beer
and
you
wanna
take
her
home
and
stick
it
in
her
ear
get
a
six
of
wild
blue
and
make
her
suck
down
one
or
two
shell
be
feeling
mighty
fine
and
then
youll
have
her
behind
color
aroma
flavor
well
think
nantucket
nectar
juice
with
a
splash
of
soda
water
to
give
a
light
tingle
of
carbonation
no
head
to
speak
of
the
bar
was
too
dark
to
really
get
a
good
feel
for
its
color
but
it
sure
looked
blueberry
juicelike
to
me
no
lingering
flavor
to
follow
the
sweet
blueberry
juice
start
no
malt
finish
or
dash
of
hops
to
bite
back
i
really
couldnt
tell
that
this
was
a
beer
at
all
at
8
this
thing
could
be
a
very
dangerous
thing
because
you
dont
really
notice
the
alcohol
id
class
it
along
with
wine
coolers
just
with
barley
as
the
alcohol
source
anyway
it
poured
a
purple
blue
color
with
no
head
smelled
of
sweet
concentrated
fruit
tasted
the
same
like
a
mouthful
of
blueberry
pie
filling
it
was
very
sweet
but
not
too
much
to
handle
i
could
have
gone
for
another
and
the
8
is
a
plus
considering
you
cant
taste
any
of
it
in
its
defense
it
did
make
a
great
blueberry
fudge
cake
and
my
girlfriend
liked
it
so
i
gave
it
some
taste
points
conclusion
i
know
i
said
dimatapp
alot
and
i
know
dimatapp
is
grape
but
this
totally
reminds
me
of
it
its
not
good
but
not
bas
and
may
not
be
a
beer
some
will
absolutely
love
it
and
others
like
me
will
drink
it
if
its
around
and
you
want
something
that
doesnt
taste
like
beer
for
some
reason
d
ok
i
thought
this
was
a
beer
good
ol
anheuserbusch
pulled
a
fast
one
including
not
having
its
name
on
the
bottle
if
you
want
the
beer
version
of
communion
wine
this
is
it
i
should
have
researched
this
one
before
buying
oh
well
live
and
learn
astmd
someone
poured
concentrated
blueberry
juice
in
my
bud
light
ice
tried
this
one
on
two
occasions
both
time
i
was
only
able
to
muster
up
3
to
5
drinks
before
this
swill
went
back
to
the
water
table
yuck
edit
couldnt
even
finish
it
bad
d
not
good
it
was
a
chore
to
finish
this
and
im
not
looking
forward
to
the
other
5
in
the
fridge
dwow
it
was
hard
to
finish
one
of
these
i
simply
just
did
not
enjoy
this
and
would
not
recommend
it
im
glad
i
did
not
pay
for
this
beer
d
the
8
abv
is
no
where
to
be
found
here
all
i
could
taste
was
blueberries
its
like
a

almost

drinker
for
those
who
like
the
taste

purple
with
a
bright
pink
head
i
never
thought
i
would
see
the
day
smells
overly
fruity
and
tastes
like
a
cranberry
juice
cocktail
way
too
fruity
here
had
trouble
even
finishing
it
the
appearance
is
pretty
cool
looking
and
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
but
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
if
you
can
drink
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
you
deserve
an
award
i
was
pretty
furious
when
i
found
out
this
stuff
was
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
it
says
nothing
about
them
on
the
bottle
or
the
box
and
i
never
would
have
bought
it
if
i
had
known
that
and
it
also
says
on
the
box
that
it
won
a
2006
gold
medal
from
the
north
american
brewers
association
yet
when
you
go
to
the
naba
website
2006
is
the
only
year
without
the
award
winners
posted
hmmm
all
in
all
a
very
deceptive
product
presentation
which
i
unfortunately
fell
for
i
should
have
known
based
on
the
abv
number
and
the
price
is
as
drinkable
as
soda
or
juice
tastes
closer
to
a
mixed
drink
or
wine
cooler
but
i
dont
mind
its
still
good
not
sure
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
these
though
if
blueberry
is
your
thing
this
is
for
you
this
is
easy
to
drink
one
or
two
after
two
it
is
just
way
too
sweet
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
malt
beverage
than
a
beer
i
dont
think
i
can
ever
drink
this
again
pours
a
three
finger
pink
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
red
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
blueberry
nose
flavor
is
sweet
blueberry
more
like
a
fruit
drink
with
hints
of
hops
the
8
abv
is
totally
hidden
as
a
beer
it
is
a
one
as
a
refreshing
beverage
its
a
three
or
so
1
33
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
manchester
wine
and
liquors
manchester
ct
d
drinkability
suffers
here
due
to
its
extreme
overkill
of
sugary
sweetness
even
one
is
far
to
much
at
times
not
bad
flavor
wise
just
way
overkill
hinders
this
keep
a
glucose
meter
handy
and
dont
say
i
didnt
warn
you
i
dont
usually
trash
a
beer
like
this
i
try
to
find
some
redeeming
quality
but
there
is
none
in
this
ok
seriously
can
anheuser
busch
make
a
good
beer
wtf
is
this
thing
i
poured
it
and
was
surprised
to
see
a
liquid
like
fizzy
cranberry
juice
magenta
beer
purple
foam
smells
like
artificial
flavor
over
hard
alcohol
upon
tasting
i
see
why
this
brew
is
a
whopping
8
and
the
heavy
use
of
fake
flavoring
is
there
to
cover
the
bottom
shelf
liquor
flavor
up
there
is
nothing
but
fake
blueberry
to
taste
like
a
smirnoff
ice
only
stronger
sweeter
and
harder
to
drink
i
can
barely
call
this
beer
its
only
saving
grace
is
it
does
have
a
semidecent
head
upon
pouring
that
laces
nicely
as
you
drink
it
but
i
was
glad
when
i
was
done
drinking
it
steer
clear
oh
beloved
readers
d
if
i
cared
to
i
could
have
forced
myself
to
drink
this
over
an
hour
or
so
but
it
just
sat
there
in
my
glass
and
i
eventually
dumped
it
overall
i
was
not
fond
of
this
beer
many
of
my
friends
who
know
nothing
about
beer
liked
it
go
figure
this
beer
is
basically
a
wine
cooler
in
a
bottle
it
seems
to
lack
both
the
defining
flavors
that
are
associated
with
beer
and
the
resulting
balance
that
can
only
exist
by
virtue
of
possessing
both
hop
and
malt
flavors
if
youre
in
for
something
sweet
that
lacks
bitterness
and
balance
then
this
is
for
you
otherwise
theres
not
really
a
whole
lot
here
except
for
what
the
label
says
blueberry
even
then
it
doesnt
look
much
like
a
blueberry
overall
like
i
said
before
it
looks
cool
but
thats
all
it
has
this
is
basically
something
that
smirnoff
should
have
come
up
with
and
maybe
then
itll
taste
better
otherwise
try
it
once
and
forget
about
it
d
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
my
friend
brought
over
a
sixpack
and
other
than
the
two
we
had
to
try
it
no
one
else
has
opened
one
not
a
good
beer
and
not
recommended
avoid
this
beer
this
is
awful
stuff
i
was
lucky
that
i
got
only
one
bottle
and
didnt
waste
my
money
on
the
six
pack
i
am
disappointed
this
tastes
like
peels
or
heavily
spiked
grape
soda
i
did
not
pick
up
on
any
beer
qualities
the
high
alcohol
content
is
a
plus
sadly
it
is
the
only
good
thing
going
for
wild
blue
i
am
afraid
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
stomach
more
than
2
because
his
beer
is
just
way
too
sweet
the
aftertaste
is
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
leaves
the
tongue
and
teeth
with
an
unpleasant
sour
coating
i
like
many
was
fooled
by
this
beer
sitting
on
the
shelves
of
my
local
kroger
oh
an
awardwinning
blueberry
lager
by
some
brewery
ive
never
heard
of
i
should
try
it
i
thought
bad
idea
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
ruby
and
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
sweet
cranberry
and
vodka
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
at
all
and
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
more
than
two
of
these
at
a
time
the
8
alcohol
made
me
reach
for
this
recently
only
to
cap
off
my
buzz
and
help
get
rid
of
this
misleading
brew
reading
the
bottom
of
the
box
and
finding
out
who
actually
makes
this
it
is
clear
that
ab
just
sent
some
bud
or
maybe
even
busch
or
nattie
lite
to
texas
to
have
some
blueberry
syrup
dumped
in
it
unfortunately
i
drain
poured
this
one
overall
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
d
i
would
label
it
not
that
easy
to
drink
and
leave
it
at
that
it
just
tastes
like
they
were
trying
to
do
too
much
with
it
it
was
interesting
to
experience
it
the
taste
is
just
way
too
in
your
face
grape
juice
and
lager
mixed
it
is
not
that
interesting
until
the
finish
where
there
is
a
nutty
slightly
drying
taste
the
back
end
also
suffers
from
a
throaty
abv
burn
that
is
just
unbalanced
with
the
rest
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
hard
to
digest
after
awhile
and
it
really
isnt
that
good
this
is
a
beer
with
adjunct
sweetner
but
in
this
case
it
was
just
over
the
top
and
badly
compromised
any
integrity
this
thing
may
have
had
pours
a
diluted
blood
red
with
a
tall
pinkish
head
that
retains
nicely
leaving
behind
some
of
the
best
lacing
ive
seen
in
a
while
the
nose
is
reminding
me
of
new
tire
smellvery
plasticysome
slight
berrybut
not
fresh
smelling
the
taste
is
cheap
and
sugary
mostly
wild
berry
and
some
grape
juice
flavors
there
is
almost
no
mouthfeelthin
and
watery
with
low
carbonation
the
alcohol
seems
well
hiddentho
with
some
more
alcohol
flavors
this
may
have
somthing
else
to
talk
aboutthis
one
is
very
one
dimentional
i
was
really
excited
about
this
when
i
saw
it
as
i
love
blueberries
and
it
mentioned
some
awards
that
were
won
i
saw
the
8abv
and
thought
whoa
it
is
designed
to
look
like
a
microbrew
but
is
brewed
by
ab
it
pours
very
purple
like
a
limbic
or
a
fruit
juice
and
is
kind
of
acidic
it
doesnt
have
much
beer
taste
too
it
but
more
like
a
fruit
juice
i
can
drink
it
but
im
disappointed
sometimes
you
have
to
experience
the
really
bad
in
order
to
appreciate
the
really
good
this
was
my
first
blueberry
lager
i
swore
that
i
liked
the
taste
of
blueberries
but
know
i
am
not
sure
anymore
it
smelled
like
a
grapeblueberry
juice
not
beer
it
tasted
exactly
as
it
smelled
and
left
a
anasty
tart
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
that
great
i
think
it
was
like
drinking
a
sparkling
wine
drinkablitlity
baqrely
got
through
this
thing
www
theviceblog
com
wild
blue
is
an
odd
tasting
brew
and
it
really
belongs
in
the
category
of
a
winebeer
hybrid
this
beer
is
far
too
sweet
and
too
blueberry
enhanced
to
take
seriously
as
a
malt
beverage
product
its
like
an
alcoholic
grape
soda
and
wine
mixture
it
might
make
a
good
addition
as
an
ingredient
in
certain
foods
liked
cooked
desserts
but
it
certainly
tastes
nothing
like
beer
and
its
a
product
to
avoid
drinks
okay
but
cloying
sweetness
makes
this
a
one
done
the
sweetness
makes
me
think
alcopops
not
beer
still
as
good
or
better
than
sea
dogs
blueberry
offering
imo
the
look
taste
of
this
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
believe
this
is
derived
from
all
natural
flavors
im
sure
my
wife
will
love
this
id
pick
some
up
for
her
if
no
other
beers
of
this
ilk
were
on
offer
my
rating
is
much
higher
than
the
norm
but
i
callem
how
i
see
them
even
if
ab
is
trying
to
pull
the
wool
over
folks
eyes
ive
found
more
offenisive
flavors
in
other
ab
beers
un
the
mainstream
but
it
could
just
be
me
this
is
a
honest
review
but
also
a
warning
i
have
had
some
great
beer
with
fruit
undertones
and
taste
this
is
not
that
type
of
beer
this
is
a
malt
beverage
along
the
lines
of
smirnoff
etc
garbage
gotta
give
ab
credit
for
their
marketingpresentation
tactics
they
got
a
couple
of
bucks
from
me
wont
happen
again
though
next
time
i
go
to
my
local
ill
suggest
this
be
near
the
malternatives
amongst
those
this
is
like
a
pop
i
drank
it
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
would
never
call
this
beer
tasted
on
52208
drinkability
was
surprisingly
high
this
is
not
to
heavy
the
booze
is
well
hidden
and
the
blueberry
flavor
is
strong
and
pure
the
label
says
its
made
with
all
natural
ingredients
if
that
means
just
grain
sugar
and
berries
then
im
impressed
i
recognize
its
not
for
everyone
and
really
doesnt
even
taste
like
beer
but
its
pretty
clear
from
the
label
what
your
buying
aside
from
who
makes
it
and
it
far
surpassed
my
expectations
in
that
regard
i
was
surprised
how
i
kept
having
to
bump
up
the
scores
still
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
isnt
my
style
and
ill
probably
never
bother
having
it
again
quite
the
panty
dropper
for
the
sorostitues
im
sure
my
score
4
0
i
dumped
the
rest
of
the
beer
out
horrible
horrible
the
girl
with
us
wouldnt
try
it
because
she
smelled
it
and
said
it
smelled
like
crotch
the
brew
presents
as
carbonated
blueberry
syrup
from
ihop
there
was
little
to
no
head
aroma
was
overwhelmingly
sweet
and
syrup
like
the
taste
thankfully
was
not
as
syrupy
but
there
was
still
an
overwhelming
blueberry
flavor
along
with
a
cidery
undertone
while
not
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
heavy
which
hurts
drinkability
when
i
first
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
i
thought
i
had
somehow
bought
grape
soda
but
i
can
get
past
the
look
the
auroma
is
not
too
bad
at
all
but
i
really
dont
know
where
they
were
going
for
on
the
flavor
tastes
more
like
a
box
of
fruit
juice
than
a
beer
by
far
the
worst
blueberry
beer
ive
ever
encountered
i
always
hate
giving
beer
a
bad
review
but
jeez
this
isnt
even
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
raspberry
color
forming
a
12
inch
light
raspberry
colored
head
light
hazy
lacing
the
aroma
is
all
berry
and
thats
it
the
taste
is
completely
dominated
by
a
syrupy
berry
flavor
this
is
exactly
what
st
ides
berry
flavor
malt
liqour
tastes
like
light
mouthfeel
drinkability
its
a
struggle
to
get
through
one
so
two
is
way
out
of
the
question
overall
i
bought
this
for
my
girlfriend
since
she
likes
the
fruit
beers
but
even
she
couldnt
stand
this
avoid
so
they
let
me
try
one
and
i
was
shocked
that
this
shit
came
out
purple
with
no
real
carbonation
its
like
grape
juice
a
blueberry
smell
is
somewhat
prevelant
but
it
is
weak
and
a
tad
medicinal
unfortunately
that
is
the
best
part
there
is
no
blueberry
flavor
in
fact
this
reminded
me
of
some
bad
cheap
red
wine
i
have
had
in
the
past
the
abv
is
extremely
noticeable
as
it
slightly
burnt
my
tastebuds
on
the
backend
it
goes
down
watery
and
chunky
with
a
very
sharp
astringent
taste
of
faux
fruit
and
alcohol
not
enjoyable
at
all
and
i
couldnt
finish
the
brew
my
buddy
gave
me
despite
trying
to
be
a
nice
guy
overall
this
isnt
a
very
good
brew
but
i
have
had
worse
from
this
style
and
this
brewer
pours
an
interesting
purple
color
with
little
foamlacing
yes
it
definitely
has
a
blueberry
aroma
but
its
extraordinarily
fake
taste
is
supersweet
like
a
winecooler
i
get
no
indications
of
any
beer
qualities
in
this
lager
i
dunno
it
is
what
it
is
im
sure
some
women
who
claim
to
hate
beer
would
enjoy
this
one
with
high
alcohol
content
i
think
this
one
was
brewed
for
the
soul
intention
of
shady
college
guys
getting
high
school
girls
drunk
d
i
feel
bad
for
this
one
but
i
thought
it
was
very
wasy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
put
a
couple
back
which
i
often
do
not
do
i
may
not
order
this
often
as
it
is
not
my
ideal
style
but
i
did
enjoy
it
for
8
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
bottle
i
had
this
at
a
beer
tasting
at
a
local
large
beer
store
i
sought
this
out
because
i
like
this
type
of
beer
the
aroma
is
blueberries
very
strong
blueberries
the
color
definitely
has
a
blueberry
tint
to
it
the
taste
is
blueberries
not
in
a
good
way
it
is
a
sickly
sweet
syrupy
blueberry
taste
no
subtlety
to
this
at
all
as
with
some
of
abs
other
offerings
in
the
micro
world
they
are
heavy
handed
and
overdone
ill
stick
with
sea
dogs
version
d
i
doesnt
taste
good
at
all
but
the
alcohol
i
find
to
be
well
hidden
surprised
at
that
even
so
much
that
my
wife
asked
me
to
get
more
wouldnt
have
thought
that
given
the
booze
i
was
told
there
was
a
good
new
blueberry
beer
out
in
texas
and
indeed
there
were
two
at
the
store
this
one
and
another
that
had
a
dog
in
a
rain
hat
i
am
assuming
i
picked
the
wrong
one
because
this
is
wretched
had
a
single
one
of
these
floating
in
a
tube
down
a
river
recently
so
i
cant
really
account
for
its
appearance
but
this
stuff
was
pretty
rank
very
phenolic
almost
peptolike
mouthfeel
and
taste
chalky
medicine
artificial
blueberry
and
alcohol
didnt
taste
anything
like
beer
or
fruit
beer
dont
waste
your
time
or
money
on
it
lightmedium
bodied
easily
drinkable
if
you
keep
it
cold
and
like
blueberry
this
really
comes
across
more
as
a
blueberry
malt
liquor
or
wine
cooler
than
as
a
beer
but
in
that
light
its
not
bad
at
all
if
you
like
blueberry
koolaid
with
a
little
more
kick
give
it
a
try
too
sweet
for
me
brewed
from
juice
not
extract
wont
be
having
this
again
pour
a
purpleish
burgund
with
rose
highlights
good
bubbling
and
a
light
film
of
foam
at
the
top
of
the
beer
doesnt
look
like
a
beer
at
first
glance
color
wise
but
i
do
recall
lots
of
other
great
fruit
beers
having
very
thick
deep
colors
the
aroma
is
a
strong
blueberry
with
hints
of
grapes
and
prunes
and
just
a
touch
of
corn
mixed
ith
cheap
alcohol
very
juicey
from
th
first
sip
blueberries
blackberriesand
some
grapes
juicey
fruity
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
what
i
expected
but
you
cant
let
this
beer
get
warm
at
all
the
boozy
taste
gets
a
bit
overpowering
very
fruity
a
bit
adjuncty
and
does
not
get
better
as
it
warms
appearance
has
a
reddish
blueberry
hue
with
a
simple
blueberry
foam
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
has
not
much
just
a
little
fruity
blueberry
aroma
to
it
taste
has
a
sharp
artificial
fruit
blueberry
i
quess
flavor
followed
by
a
acidic
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
talked
up
a
lot
by
coworkers
but
i
just
dont
taste
what
they
see
in
it
d
bad
my
wife
really
likes
it
though
mouthfeel
was
not
great
but
not
awfulnot
horribly
acidic
like
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
this
is
simply
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
fact
im
not
convinced
this
is
beer
and
would
classify
it
as
a
malternative
with
a
little
beer
in
it
this
has
to
be
a
blueberry
version
of
hooch
with
some
bud
light
in
it
right
is
somebody
joking
with
this
drinkability
not
the
slightest
bit
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
id
say
this
is
worth
checking
out
i
dont
know
why
everyone
else
seems
to
hate
it
simply
the
worst
beer
i
think
i
have
ever
had
poured
a
bright
unnatural
bluepink
color
with
a
big
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappeared
smell
was
nothing
big
sweet
processed
sugary
blueberry
i
was
not
looking
forward
to
the
taste
and
my
hunch
was
right
the
taste
was
nothing
but
syrupy
blueberries
so
sweet
that
it
actually
stung
the
mouthfeel
was
incredibly
fizzy
ive
had
some
bad
beers
in
my
day
but
i
couldnt
finish
more
then
4
sips
of
this
one
it
was
more
like
a
novelty
soda
gone
bad
than
a
beer
its
beers
like
this
that
give
other
fruit
beers
a
bad
bad
name
stay
away
just
plain
awful
not
beer
at
all
avoid
this
at
all
costs
dont
bother
this
isnt
beer
im
off
to
dump
this
one
if
i
had
noticed
this
was
a
busch
product
i
probably
would
have
steered
clear
but
i
didnt
and
had
the
unfortunate
experience
of
drinking
this
beer
in
the
glass
it
looks
exactly
like
red
wine
and
smells
like
blueberry
syrup
it
hits
your
tongue
with
a
nauseating
overpowering
faux
blueberry
taste
with
no
beer
flavor
at
all
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
beer
i
would
have
mistaken
it
for
blueberry
punch
also
its
sweeter
than
a
soda
this
is
a
wretched
vile
beverage
that
you
should
avoid
this
is
not
beer
very
disappointing
i
actually
poured
the
last
half
down
the
drain
after
my
girlfriend
and
i
struggled
to
drink
the
first
half
d
not
for
me
chicks
might
dig
this
but
the
high
abv
could
be
a
disaster
for
lightweight
little
girls
like
my
fiance
who
feel
crazy
after
one
wine
cooler
this
stuff
really
shouldnt
even
be
considered
beer
drinkability
not
altogether
terrible
but
certainly
not
for
me
like
a
blend
of
hawaiian
punch
and
wine
cooler
plus
8
alcohol
pours
out
like
a
mix
of
grape
and
red
koolaid
tiny
head
that
leaves
some
spots
of
lace
has
an
odd
artificial
blueberry
thing
going
on
ive
had
other
blueberry
beers
and
they
actually
smelled
like
real
blueberries
go
figure
not
much
else
is
going
on
a
little
alcohol
maybe
wow
what
a
taste
artificial
sweetness
and
artificial
fruit
flavor
reminiscent
of
leinenkugels
berry
weiss
dominating
with
some
rancid
graininess
underneath
finish
and
aftertaste
taste
exactly
like
dimetapp
really
disgusting
also
theres
some
booziness
mouthfeel
has
the
slick
and
thick
feel
of
a
malt
liquor
with
a
stickiness
from
the
sweetness
here
terrible
d
i
struggled
to
complete
hopefully
this
doesnt
sour
me
on
other
blueberry
beers
pours
very
red
light
like
a
red
wine
with
almost
no
head
with
below
average
lacing
below
average
carbonation
with
a
sweet
smell
of
hawaiian
punch
tastes
bitter
and
sweet
but
this
stuff
is
awful
this
is
awful
and
tastes
like
fermented
hi
c
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid
drinkable
in
a
small
quantity
but
only
just
i
didnt
find
it
awful
like
some
bas
but
wasnt
impressed
either
im
actually
more
pissed
about
how
its
marketed
instead
of
stating
its
from
anheiserbusch
and
i
freely
admit
that
because
ab
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
big
iii
i
might
have
passed
on
it
the
label
states
its
brewed
by
blue
dawg
brewing
of
baldwinsville
ny
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
i
believe
blue
moon
still
states
its
brewed
by
coors
or
molsencoors
having
a
seemingly
new
brewing
company
from
ny
on
the
label
with
a
picture
on
the
label
that
more
than
anything
else
reminded
me
of
flying
dog
is
a
fairly
disingenuous
way
to
market
beer
especially
for
a
corporation
that
criticizes
the
way
that
micros
and
craft
brewers
label
their
contractbrewed
beers
it
pours
a
light
cranberry
color
with
a
pink
head
the
aroma
is
strong
and
full
of
blueberries
and
some
malt
notes
its
flavor
is
overwhelmingly
fake
and
sweet
with
blueberries
adding
some
tartness
hop
and
malt
flavors
are
barely
detected
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
a
sticky
texture
and
the
carbonation
is
fizzy
a
this
poured
a
reddish
blue
color
when
i
was
dumping
it
down
the
drain
i
should
have
looked
first
im
being
honest
here
this
is
the
mad
dog
2020
or
erknjerk
of
beers
for
the
fruit
juice
drinker
not
the
beer
drinker
who
just
wants
to
get
loaded
all
in
all
a
big
disappointment
id
be
all
for
drinking
an
ab
beer
which
i
didnt
know
it
was
until
i
logged
on
ba
if
it
was
a
good
one
but
that
being
said
this
isnt
i
was
hoping
for
an
inventive
blueberrytinged
hellesbock
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
brewery
instead
i
got
artificialflavor
jacked
malt
liquor
blech
what
a
disaster
drinkability
not
as
horrible
as
i
was
anticipating
on
the
same
level
as
any
of
the
sweet
lambics
out
there
i
actually
enjoyed
it
hell
much
better
than
most
of
the
latest
ab
attempts
to
brew
outside
the
box
really
dose
cross
the
line
out
of
the
beer
world
and
into
the
malt
beverage
realm
for
me
this
is
like
the
ghetto
version
of
a
lindemans
in
my
opinion
at
least
a
lindemans
was
a
lambic
before
they
juiced
it
up
i
am
not
sure
this
was
ever
more
than
a
budweiser
rice
lager
with
blueberry
puree
and
corn
syrup
pours
purple
with
a
decent
fizzy
pink
head
mild
sweet
grape
aroma
taste
is
very
sweet
blueberries
and
grapes
not
a
very
deep
flavor
profile
definitely
does
not
taste
like
beer
but
this
is
a
fruit
beer
after
all
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
gets
old
quickly
however
i
dont
think
this
is
all
that
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
ive
had
other
attempts
at
blueberry
beers
raspberry
beers
etc
and
they
either
end
up
watery
and
tasteless
or
are
a
beer
with
a
just
a
hint
of
fruit
or
whatever
at
least
this
one
goes
all
the
way
and
becomes
basically
an
alcoholic
blueberry
pop
if
this
had
a
bit
more
of
a
true
blueberry
flavor
and
wasnt
so
over
the
top
with
its
sweetness
it
would
probably
be
quite
tasty
wanted
to
give
this
a
shot
bought
this
for
my
girlfriend
and
the
both
of
us
came
up
with
one
conclusion
it
is
god
awful
pours
out
a
purple
grape
soda
color
actually
thats
what
it
tastes
like
grape
soda
only
worse
by
far
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
pour
it
down
the
toilet
cause
thats
where
it
belongs
the
bottle
says
brewed
by
blue
dawg
brewing
in
baldwinsville
ny
near
syracuse
i
figured
id
give
a
local
place
a
chance
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
tastes
like
a
can
of
the
blueberries
from
boxed
muffin
mix
the
high
carbonation
is
a
welcome
surprise
and
actually
makes
the
beer
more
tolerable
it
wont
be
high
on
my
list
but
id
have
it
again
the
reviewer
that
called
it
grape
soda
was
deadon
its
basically
the
beer
equivalent
of
cisco
wine
the
taste
is
all
koolaid
no
booze
it
was
hidden
in
with
the
microbrews
and
knowing
that
it
could
be
an
anheiserbusch
plant
i
checked
it
real
carefully
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
it
doesnt
say
it
anywhere
on
the
bottle
clearly
i
was
mistaken
but
while
strong
it
is
terrible
candyflavored
high
fructose
cornsyruped
beer
that
will
probably
get
you
drunk
but
its
more
of
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
avoid
i
would
suggest
easily
the
worst
beer
ive
purchased
in
years
i
hate
to
review
a
beer
like
this
but
it
just
bore
so
little
resemblance
to
such
a
well
respected
beverage
that
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
say
anything
good
about
it
d
i
finished
it
but
thats
probably
the
best
thing
i
can
say
for
its
drinkability
i
am
not
surprised
the
outcome
of
this
anheuserbusch
product
the
only
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
the
high
alcohol
content
so
you
really
have
to
chug
it
quick
to
get
past
the
taste
and
get
drunk
poured
a
surprising
dark
fuschia
color
with
a
tiny
little
purple
head
smells
of
very
very
faint
blueberries
but
you
need
your
nose
practically
in
the
glass
to
detect
them
has
an
abysmal
taste
of
watered
down
sour
blue
berries
almost
like
an
iced
cold
very
bad
tasting
merlot
if
pouring
syrupy
blueberry
juice
into
a
macroish
beer
with
pumped
up
alcohol
is
your
thing
go
for
it
as
for
me
im
glad
that
i
only
grabbed
a
single
and
i
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
dark
purple
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
purple
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
there
isnt
a
lot
going
on
here
its
extremely
dry
with
a
mild
blueberry
scent
the
taste
is
average
as
well
ive
gotta
give
it
up
to
ab
on
this
one
they
have
got
some
serious
balls
to
put
this
on
the
market
what
the
hell
am
i
drinking
the
blueberry
taste
is
there
uncompromised
they
even
kicked
up
the
abv
8
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
first
for
me
blueberry
lager
its
even
blue
if
this
were
my
homebrew
club
id
be
impressed
but
this
is
the
socalled
king
of
beers
what
a
joke
wild
blue
blueberry
lager
pours
a
purple
color
with
a
thin
purple
head
smells
like
hic
the
flavor
is
a
flat
out
disaster
it
tastes
nothing
like
beer
and
not
really
like
a
wine
cooler
or
typical
malternative
either
there
is
some
vaguely
fruit
like
flavor
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
blueberry
blech
drain
pour
this
was
my
first
random
six
pack
purchase
in
quite
a
while
and
my
next
buy
will
either
be
a
regular
or
i
will
go
to
a
store
with
a
beer
connoisseur
before
i
make
the
same
mistake
again
is
this
a
new
flavor
of
maddog
2020
i
didnt
notice
that
this
was
an
anheuserbusch
offering
until
i
took
my
first
sip
simply
strong
dirty
budweiser
with
a
indistinguishable
cheap
fruit
syrup
i
was
intrigued
by
an
8
alcohol
lager
with
fruit
hints
so
i
tried
it
out
i
was
absolutely
repulsed
by
what
i
ended
up
with
this
crap
basically
ruined
my
night
this
beer
pours
a
plum
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
pink
in
color
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
artificial
blueberries
the
taste
is
a
combination
of
blueberries
and
bile
this
is
the
most
offensive
tasting
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
over
carbonated
and
watery
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
wasnt
as
rancid
as
i
was
expecting
actually
the
blueberry
flavoring
helped
out
a
lot
but
still
way
too
boozy
still
its
hard
to
believe
this
isnt
a
sparks
alcoholic
energy
drink
md
mouthfeel
basically
just
like
soda
pop
or
a
wine
cooler
beer
is
definitely
not
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
drinking
this
oddly
this
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
if
you
can
get
past
the
sweet
juiciness
im
probably
going
out
on
a
limb
here
but
i
think
this
brew
was
at
least
an
interesting
departure
from
the
norm
no
i
do
not
want
to
drink
any
more
of
this
i
suppose
this
could
be
a
decent
choice
for
an
alternative
to
juice
at
breakfast
but
unless
youre
used
to
wine
cooler
and
are
looking
for
something
stronger
avoid
this
beer
pours
a
dark
blueberry
stain
color
with
soapy
pink
head
out
of
the
bottle
smelled
like
blueberry
muffins
but
once
in
the
glass
smelled
alcoholic
medicinal
and
like
a
powdered
drink
mix
taste
high
fructose
corn
syrup
artificial
blueberry
flavoring
funky
malt
liquor
aftertaste
this
is
truly
horrible
going
down
the
drain
definitely
blueberries
in
here
somewhere
but
wow
not
in
a
good
way
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
purple
color
with
a
thin
and
fizzy
light
purple
head
that
quickly
disappears
this
looks
more
like
a
glass
of
grape
juice
than
beer
the
aroma
is
all
blueberries
and
maybe
a
little
grape
the
taste
is
well
not
very
good
to
put
it
lightly
it
is
overly
sweet
with
an
artificial
tasting
blueberrygrape
flavor
that
is
on
top
of
a
cheap
tasting
malt
liquor
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
from
the
high
carbonation
much
like
a
glass
of
sparkling
grape
juice
overall
i
am
going
to
stay
far
away
from
this
beer
in
the
future
totally
unenjoyable
i
hope
it
dies
a
quick
painful
death
pours
like
cranberry
juice
with
a
bright
pink
head
pretty
strange
looking
and
artificial
smell
is
metallic
blueberries
taste
is
sweet
corn
like
maltiness
mixed
with
blueberry
syrup
slight
touch
of
alcohol
coming
through
in
the
flavor
medium
bodied
from
the
syrupy
nature
of
it
very
sweet
and
artificial
but
with
some
beer
maltiness
in
there
too
hmm
more
like
a
mixed
drink
than
a
fruit
beer
not
very
subtle
but
hell
it
one
of
them
is
drinkable
i
guess
pours
a
crisp
grape
purple
with
a
fuchsia
colored
head
this
is
beer
right
aroma
was
some
faint
blueberry
juice
the
taste
was
reminiscent
of
a
cross
between
a
spoiled
wine
cooler
and
sparkling
grape
juice
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
with
present
alcohol
that
lingers
along
with
the
fruit
in
the
finish
i
have
to
say
having
never
heard
of
this
beer
it
intrigued
me
enough
to
buy
a
single
bottle
and
i
have
to
say
im
glad
thats
all
i
wasted
my
money
on
the
teenages
are
gonna
love
this
stuff
especially
at
8
abv
d
i
will
never
drink
this
one
again
i
may
have
to
throw
away
the
pint
glass
i
drank
it
from
so
its
remnants
dont
taint
any
other
beer
feels
and
tastes
a
lot
like
a
wine
cooler
artificial
blueberry
booziness
cloyingly
sweet
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
somewhat
excited
but
that
soon
died
down
once
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
pours
a
dirty
dark
purple
colour
some
lacing
and
very
little
foam
smell
is
of
5
day
old
berries
with
slight
rot
taste
seems
a
bit
tacky
like
a
lighter
version
of
night
train
see
bumwine
hides
the
alcohol
fairly
well
but
i
dont
think
i
smiled
once
drinking
this
another
effort
by
bud
to
craft
brew
1
thumb
up
on
that
note
but
about
as
exciting
as
a
baseball
game
ya
baseball
sucks
buyer
beware
poured
a
dark
ruby
in
color
with
a
quarter
inch
purple
head
that
settled
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
with
no
lace
smell
was
pleasant
with
blueberry
pie
aromas
taste
is
super
sweet
blueberry
malt
and
slightly
alcohol
with
some
rough
edges
to
it
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
ok
good
as
a
one
bottle
desert
beer
only
d
it
is
a
strong
fruit
lager
that
borders
on
malt
liquorcooler
a
taste
that
really
is
not
very
interesting
or
rewarding
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
until
it
warms
but
it
really
isnt
worth
trying
again
imo
verdict
awful
ive
had
plenty
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
the
absolute
worst
ive
ever
had
i
have
to
agree
with
other
reviews
the
blueberry
begins
and
never
ends
theres
no
actual
beer
taste
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
a
glass
of
this
not
the
worst
flavored
beer
i
have
had
but
i
do
not
suggest
going
back
for
seconds
drinkablity
fairly
tasty
beer
different
and
not
as
obnoxious
as
many
brews
infused
with
fruit
and
vegetables
d
if
i
wanted
to
get
absolutely
bombed
and
not
mind
the
sugar
hangover
maybe
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
really
no
this
is
nasty
if
my
girlfriend
doesnt
like
it
ill
cook
with
it
it
seems
like
itd
be
alright
in
pancakes
note
i
was
really
upset
when
i
had
this
and
i
feel
i
just
acted
too
impulsive
when
i
purchased
it
i
usually
snap
a
pic
with
the
phone
and
check
it
out
on
the
site
we
live
and
learn
i
feel
as
if
it
is
still
slithering
down
my
throat
like
some
slimy
creature
this
has
no
business
being
called
a
beer
another
reviewer
has
it
right
this
beer
is
much
more
akin
to
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
syrupy
sweet
with
more
candygrape
flavor
than
blueberry
fizzy
sodalike
appearance
and
texutre
no
obvious
malt
character
at
all
all
sugar
not
a
hop
character
in
sight
artificial
fruitiness
and
flavor
and
not
much
else
everything
about
this
beer
screams
advertisement
to
an
under21
audience
right
down
to
the
cartoonish
logo
and
juniorhigh
wording
on
the
package
this
is
kool
aid
at
8
definitely
avoid
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
off
i
smelled
something
sweet
a
hard
pour
got
me
a
inch
head
that
was
pink
in
color
the
beer
was
a
bright
rose
color
the
smell
reminded
me
of
grape
juice
the
head
vanished
fairly
quickly
i
then
tasted
it
my
friends
description
of
soda
pop
can
to
mind
very
quickly
if
someone
had
given
me
this
beer
in
a
blind
folded
taste
test
with
no
information
about
it
i
would
have
never
had
known
that
it
was
a
beer
let
alone
blueberry
the
grape
taste
is
overpowering
i
usually
can
finish
even
a
beer
that
doesnt
work
for
me
but
this
beer
is
putting
that
practice
to
the
test
a
disgusting
sugery
drink
this
is
not
for
beer
drinkers
this
is
for
those
who
drink
flavored
malt
beverages
reminds
be
of
tasting
samples
of
zima
at
coors
but
a
lot
lot
sweeter
d
whats
less
than
zero
i
didnt
know
this
was
ab
when
i
picked
up
a
single
not
terrible
but
not
something
i
plan
on
having
again
maybe
i
should
try
a
leinies
berry
weiss
to
compare
overall
this
is
a
wasted
effort
by
ab
they
have
had
some
decent
beers
outside
of
the
light
lager
line
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
whoah
man
it
poured
out
all
magenta
and
purply
with
a
lavender
head
even
the
girls
in
the
room
went
eewww
nose
of
grape
juice
and
hint
of
blueberry
the
flavor
was
pretty
much
grape
juice
not
blueberry
and
it
had
a
sourness
that
blueberries
do
have
but
seemed
to
be
more
in
tune
with
the
artificial
flavor
taste
medium
body
and
it
looked
purty
as
i
dumped
it
down
the
sink
overall
as
a
beer
it
sucks
because
there
is
no
characteristics
in
it
that
gives
it
a
beer
flavor
if
i
didnt
buy
it
i
would
have
thought
it
was
some
new
bad
malternative
or
some
weird
bar
drink
but
as
a
drink
itself
it
is
ok
though
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
that
drinks
tilts
from
time
to
time
i
would
not
want
to
drink
this
more
than
once
at
a
time
but
i
can
down
it
pretty
well
and
the
sweetness
is
tricking
me
into
thinking
i
am
enjoying
some
fruit
juice
pours
a
clear
beet
redblueberry
color
that
has
a
large
purplered
head
the
head
lasts
and
leaves
good
lacingbut
this
really
looks
fake
with
artificial
fruit
juices
and
color
the
smell
is
weak
with
a
veggie
and
blueberry
scent
the
taste
is
pretty
brutal
it
doesnt
take
a
genius
too
realize
they
just
added
blueberry
juice
to
a
high
alcohol
beer
even
the
high
alcohol
is
hidden
by
the
strong
fruit
flavors
the
mf
is
medium
with
the
flavors
not
mixing
well
i
would
rather
have
a
bud
than
have
one
of
these
again
i
didnt
realize
anheuserbusch
until
after
i
had
one
it
pours
a
purple
red
blueish
color
with
a
thin
but
tall
pink
head
that
has
little
lacing
it
smells
strongly
of
blueberry
pie
not
much
more
the
taste
is
a
huge
blueberry
pie
filling
flavor
nothing
else
can
be
detected
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
alot
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
because
of
its
sweet
flavor
it
reminds
me
more
of
carbonated
blueberry
juice
and
less
like
a
beer
but
it
was
still
interesting
to
try
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
hit
in
the
mainstream
beer
market
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
i
am
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
and
will
not
be
ordering
any
for
our
store
i
just
couldnt
actually
sell
this
to
customers
with
a
clear
conscience
or
even
give
it
away
kind
of
disappointing
that
they
used
hallertau
hops
for
this
they
should
have
used
their
hops
for
other
more
effective
projects
d
i
would
rather
drink
rubbing
alcohol
than
this
i
also
agree
that
ab
is
pulling
some
shenanigans
for
not
putting
their
name
on
their
product
and
fronting
that
this
is
a
micro
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
ever
do
not
even
look
at
this
beer
on
the
shelf
or
risk
your
eyes
falling
out
well
that
explains
the
one
busch
lite
bottle
cap
among
my
sixpack
at
first
i
thought
did
someone
open
a
bottle
pour
toxic
substances
in
and
then
recap
the
bottle
with
a
busch
lite
cap
weel
now
that
i
know
its
an
ab
cheapshot
trying
to
masquerade
as
an
actual
lager
i
now
know
that
i
willnot
die
from
drinking
it
although
i
might
just
commit
suicide
because
an
ab
product
has
penetrated
my
body
in
a
nutshell
its
horrible
id
rather
stay
sober
than
drink
this
crap
i
wont
bother
with
a
full
review
on
this
one
as
it
doesnt
seem
worth
the
effort
suffice
it
to
say
if
i
was
back
in
high
school
and
looking
to
get
drunk
this
would
be
great
tastes
like
alcoholic
kool
aid
all
fruit
no
beer
definitely
the
boones
farm
of
beer
i
also
think
its
pretty
shady
of
ab
to
try
and
pass
this
off
as
a
completely
unrelated
brewery
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
disgusting
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
pours
the
color
of
a
fruit
drink
a
purple
somewhere
between
pink
and
burgundy
just
a
collar
for
a
head
the
nose
is
overpoweringly
sweet
with
an
aroma
thats
a
blend
of
fake
grape
and
fake
blueberry
this
smells
like
artificially
created
candies
and
such
that
have
blueberry
flavor
no
actual
blueberries
smell
like
this
on
the
palate
sickeningly
sweet
is
that
aspartame
with
a
consistency
and
pungency
that
reminds
of
cough
syrup
rather
than
beer
the
beer
dries
out
just
a
bit
toward
the
finish
and
thats
a
good
thing
the
fewer
the
flavors
from
this
lingering
on
your
tongue
the
better
overall
i
cant
say
enough
bad
things
about
this
beer
avoid
this
at
all
costs
why
ab
why
you
can
do
better
than
this
d
way
too
winecoolerish
for
me
doesnt
taste
like
beer
much
at
all
definitely
a
girl
who
doesnt
like
beer
type
of
beer
good
flavor
but
too
much
sweet
for
me
now
the
question
is
who
can
i
foist
the
other
5
off
to
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
rich
purplebluered
and
i
immediately
get
scared
it
has
a
lighter
purple
head
that
lowers
ever
so
quickly
aromas
are
of
blueberry
and
grainy
alcohol
taste
is
terrible
blueberries
up
front
with
a
high
alcohol
finish
i
cant
even
finish
this
beer
it
is
that
bad
but
then
again
not
much
from
ab
can
i
finish
mouthfeel
is
just
weird
very
syrupy
and
it
almost
feels
like
a
wine
cooler
that
i
stole
from
my
mom
when
i
was
15
will
i
drink
it
again
not
even
on
fear
factor
no
other
words
for
this
other
than
never
again
just
when
you
think
ab
may
be
trying
to
make
better
beer
they
come
up
with
this
shit
like
drinking
bubbley
syrup
put
some
vodka
with
blueberry
juice
concentrate
and
a
dash
of
bud
light
and
youve
just
made
this
beer
for
yourself
avoid
at
all
costs
d
nil
0
sorry
think
positive
no
one
has
an
agenda
here
it
has
a
decent
fruit
quality
that
may
really
appeal
to
people
who
arent
into
beer
there
that
was
nice
now
for
beer
lovers
stay
far
far
away
from
this
wretched
blasphemy
far
far
away
pours
a
light
ruby
color
with
little
head
smells
like
koolaid
mixed
with
alcohol
it
doesnt
look
terrible
or
smell
terrible
the
taste
is
less
than
average
ive
hard
worse
but
this
isnt
good
i
dont
like
fruit
beers
and
this
one
isnt
impressive
i
guess
if
you
like
fruit
beers
you
might
like
this
this
is
a
sparkling
grape
juice
in
a
beer
bottle
it
is
deep
red
almost
purple
smell
is
of
blueberries
and
grape
juice
tastes
like
grape
juice
carbonation
way
too
high
just
a
bad
beer
the
only
good
thing
about
this
is
it
does
pack
a
punch
with
the
8
abv
and
it
is
hidden
very
well
but
when
it
all
comes
down
to
it
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
beer
d
well
im
not
even
sure
you
can
call
this
beer
not
really
its
like
a
fruity
malternative
on
steroids
the
beer
equivalent
of
boones
farm
drinkable
well
yes
but
why
not
just
add
some
grain
alcohol
to
fruit
juice
probably
what
the
french
give
their
kids
as
an
alternative
to
rosé
to
get
them
to
take
a
nap
after
lunch
this
is
nasty
no
beer
here
to
report
wouldnt
you
think
that
the
owners
of
a
fine
premium
beer
would
be
proud
of
who
they
are
the
name
of
their
brewery
and
maybe
a
logo
i
guess
not
if
youre
anheuserbusch
pretending
youre
a
micro
brewery
shameful
this
is
simply
a
malt
liquor
merged
with
a
concentrate
blueberry
juice
based
soft
drink
nothing
more
poured
out
into
a
pint
glass
beer
was
a
deep
red
color
with
little
head
and
lacing
smell
is
strong
of
blueberries
and
malt
the
taste
is
pleasently
sweet
with
very
little
hops
the
beer
has
a
relativly
high
alcohol
content
which
is
not
noticable
due
to
the
sweet
blueberry
taste
almost
reminds
me
of
a
wine
in
consistancy
but
obviously
carbinated
the
overall
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
the
beer
was
better
balanced
on
the
hops
side
this
beer
is
an
excellent
taster
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
them
in
one
night
although
i
was
sharing
a
12
pack
provided
by
the
brewmaster
i
chose
not
to
question
him
about
this
fruit
beer
instead
asking
about
3
other
craft
brews
a
blonde
brewmasters
dopplebock
and
my
favorite
their
soon
to
be
released
porter
d
this
beer
has
big
fruit
flavors
but
needs
some
malt
or
something
to
give
it
a
balance
wild
blue
is
both
wild
and
blue
so
i
have
to
give
blue
dawg
brewing
a
small
hardworking
brewery
in
upstate
new
york
that
is
dedicated
to
earning
your
business
props
for
truth
in
advertising
thats
where
the
credit
giving
ends
though
this
is
an
abomination
of
a
fruit
beer
that
had
no
business
seeing
the
light
of
day
how
can
so
many
master
brewers
be
so
wrong
so
often
about
so
much
pours
the
most
ridiculous
cranberryjuicefuscia
with
an
evenmore
ridiculous
cottoncandy
pink
head
3
5
just
for
its
willy
wonkalike
surrealism
nose
is
very
similar
to
leinenkugels
berry
weiss
supersweet
blueberryraspberry
and
some
weak
musty
malt
taste
is
unbelievably
sweet
artificial
berry
flavoring
a
funky
malt
backing
and
stomachburning
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
somehow
slimy
and
thin
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
foul
foul
brew
i
can
see
high
school
girls
getting
their
older
sisters
to
buy
them
this
shit
so
they
can
pound
it
at
house
parties
to
get
drunk
give
me
a
smirnoff
ice
over
this
anyday
shame
on
you
ab
is
this
really
the
best
you
can
do
wild
blue
then
why
is
it
red
pours
out
to
a
reddish
color
that
is
similar
to
robitussin
head
looks
like
berry
spit
aroma
of
light
malt
and
the
vision
of
a
raspberry
soaked
in
vodka
come
to
mind
taste
is
rough
booze
berries
and
some
maltiness
blend
poorly
ugh
mouthfeel
is
unimpressive
and
slightly
dense
drinkability
is
not
that
good
wrap
this
one
up
ab
and
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
skip
it
verdict
my
firstever
beer
with
ones
across
the
board
this
is
a
terrible
irredeemable
mess
of
a
beer
the
brewmaster
who
conceived
of
this
filth
should
be
ashamed
of
himself
a
definite
drain
pour
hooch
i
received
this
for
free
and
i
thought
it
was
quite
good
not
like
a
normal
lager
and
the
feel
of
the
beer
was
a
lot
like
soda
it
had
an
immediate
beer
taste
to
it
then
you
can
taste
the
blueberry
which
in
my
opinion
tasted
a
lot
like
a
bacardi
drink
as
i
drank
it
i
could
feel
the
carbonation
swirling
in
my
mouth
at
first
i
didnt
mind
the
taste
but
bear
in
mind
that
this
was
a
fourounze
sample
and
about
halfway
through
i
felt
overwhelmed
by
the
sweetness
it
was
dificult
finishing
the
small
sample
really
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
a
sweet
very
fruity
overwhelmingly
blueberryish
beer
that
goes
down
like
juice
then
this
is
for
you
if
this
doesnt
sound
like
your
taste
i
would
recommend
trying
something
else
bodys
the
best
part
lightish
smooth
slightly
frothy
but
delicate
carbonation
no
doubt
an
after
dinner
beer
got
a
bottle
of
this
beer
for
free
so
i
figured
i
might
as
well
try
it
and
see
i
guess
my
west
michigan
is
a
test
market
for
this
beer
and
its
being
advertised
everywhere
this
is
simply
a
terrible
beer
pours
a
syrup
dark
blue
color
with
basically
no
head
and
no
sign
of
carbonation
aroma
is
weak
but
definitely
of
a
fake
blueberry
substance
taste
really
is
bad
it
is
cloying
upon
entering
the
mouth
just
so
syruppy
so
fake
so
sweet
its
disgusting
and
i
usually
dont
mind
sweeter
beers
that
much
this
was
horrible
i
sat
there
trying
to
drink
it
and
really
couldnt
i
think
i
drank
about
half
before
i
called
it
quits
do
not
get
i
dont
think
even
the
malternative
lovers
would
like
this
stuff
should
i
simply
say
ewww
so
i
have
enough
words
to
rate
it
enjoy
the
rapsberry
taste
is
definitely
prevalent
but
i
enjoyed
the
taste
as
it
warmed
however
it
did
lose
some
luster
its
on
par
for
what
id
expect
interesting
beer
more
like
a
wine
cooler
in
many
ways
summer
time
beer
served
cold
and
drank
cold
as
it
gets
warm
the
flavor
is
over
powering
raspberry
coolaid
comes
to
mind
nice
easy
drinker
nice
belgian
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
way
waaaay
too
sweet
and
fruity
they
went
over
the
top
with
this
one
its
not
bad
per
se
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
even
then
there
are
many
other
raspberry
beers
that
are
far
more
subtle
and
tasty
it
smells
very
sweet
and
fruity
but
the
taste
is
a
little
more
balanced
this
is
a
good
flavored
beer
all
year
round
im
literally
drinking
this
as
i
type
and
overall
its
bit
of
a
let
down
i
disagree
with
some
of
the
reviews
citing
it
to
be
sweet
i
find
it
rather
bland
pretty
solid
mouthfeel
but
a
complete
emptiness
on
the
palate
after
the
initial
raspberry
its
not
terrible
but
by
no
means
will
i
seek
this
out
definite
raspberry
on
the
nose
and
palate
kinda
sweet
with
a
bit
of
coriander
finish
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
for
the
patio
but
nothing
special
surprisingly
good
not
as
sweet
as
leinenkugels
berry
weiss
in
my
opinion
way
too
sweet
with
a
tart
after
taste
my
girlfriend
wanted
it
so
i
got
her
some
and
it
just
didnt
suit
me
i
like
it
overall
like
the
other
flavored
wheat
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
this
is
too
syrupy
too
sweet
and
doesnt
taste
like
its
brewed
with
natural
ingredients
even
the
bottle
states
raspberry
flavor
added
not
real
raspberries
just
the
flavor
my
girlfriend
wanted
it
i
think
it
wasted
some
space
in
my
cooler
very
strong
raspberry
flavor
not
bad
if
you
like
that
reminded
me
of
leinies
berry
weiss
overall
nothing
complex
and
not
at
the
top
of
its
style
but
it
makes
for
a
good
summer
beer
that
is
drinkable
for
pretty
much
everybody
take
a
bud
pour
in
unsweetened
raspberry
koolaid
and
you
will
have
this
beer
an
ok
beer
to
drink
once
in
a
while
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
ended
up
giving
away
some
of
the
6
pack
so
would
i
recommend
it
sure
this
is
different
than
those
lime
lemon
high
sugar
beer
thats
on
the
market
and
i
think
this
is
great
beer
for
women
too
for
myself
i
wouldnt
buy
it
all
year
long
but
during
summer
a
pack
of
12
once
or
twice
i
will
definitely
go
for
it
this
beer
is
nothing
more
than
regular
there
is
much
worse
and
many
more
better
shock
top
raspberry
wheat
is
a
surprisingly
crisp
refreshing
and
modestlyflavored
wheat
beer
that
couldve
easily
been
an
insufferably
sweettart
brew
the
brew
fittingly
compliments
belgian
white
and
honeycrisp
apple
has
pleasantly
different
options
from
mainstream
breweries
and
again
bests
blue
moon
pours
a
bright
red
with
an
off
white
head
that
fizzes
away
quickly
the
smell
is
all
raspberry
with
little
to
no
hop
or
wheat
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
very
sugary
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
also
off
too
thick
for
a
wheat
in
my
opinion
i
can
understand
why
its
popular
its
just
not
for
me
awful
shock
top
trying
to
be
bll
ugh
the
aroma
is
awesome
very
fruity
and
strong
raspberry
smell
it
almost
bummed
me
out
when
i
tasted
it
a
fruity
beer
with
almost
a
sour
character
i
mean
not
terrible
but
not
great
a
amber
color
to
it
the
aroma
pumped
me
up
but
as
far
as
taste
it
fell
short
for
me
overall
2
75
the
smell
is
deceptively
enticing
the
taste
is
cloying
but
isnt
even
the
good
kind
of
sweet
its
pretty
rejecting
the
sour
wheat
comes
in
full
force
and
drives
away
the
raspberry
and
forces
you
to
swallow
because
you
dont
want
it
in
your
mouth
anymore
this
is
a
nice
beer
once
in
a
great
while
but
honestly
i
gave
most
of
my
six
pack
away
to
friends
and
family
one
and
im
done
maybe
not
even
that
try
it
but
dont
buy
a
whole
sixer
you
may
find
yourself
trying
to
pawn
off
the
other
five
to
your
friends
here
try
this
its

with

aroma
of
fake
raspberry
syrup
is
quite
awful
with
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugars
this
is
closer
to
a
cooler
than
beer
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
grainy
wheat
malt
notes
with
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
and
way
too
much
of
the
awful
raspberry
syrup
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
i
wasnt
expecting
some
kind
of
masterpiece
but
what
a
bunch
of
crap
this
beer
was
worth
a
try
at
least
if
theyre
cheap
definitely
worth
my
3
for
a
pint
overall
mediocre
beer
maybe
worth
a
try
if
youre
curious
but
there
are
a
lot
of
better
options
out
there
pass
its
a
very
sweet
and
syrupy
tasting
beer
not
what
i
expected
out
of
the
shock
top
brews
ive
had
this
one
is
probably
my
least
favorite
it
wasnt
the
worst
ive
had
but
it
most
definitely
the
worst
its
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
liking
its
not
the
last
thing
that
id
drink
but
try
it
i
had
my
fingers
crossed
as
i
loved
the
apple
crisp
but
the
raspberry
is
just
too
fake
and
almost
brash
o
tastes
like
watereddown
raspberryflavored
cider
no
real
beer
flavor
at
all
even
though
its
labeled
wheat
not
offensive
to
drink
but
im
really
not
a
cider
fan
i
will
be
attempting
to
give
the
remainder
of
the
case
away
to
friends
who
dont
really
like
beer
that
much
but
love
granville
islands
raspberry
offering
an
example
of
this
style
done
fairly
well
although
it
is
barely
beer
i
will
also
avoid

the
future

raspberry
wheat
isnt
exactly
gross
but
it
has
very
few
beerlike
properties
and
for
that
reason
i
cant
reward
it
with
a
decent
grade
ontario
residents
with
a
craving
for
raspberry
beer
will
be
better
satisfied
with
amsterdams

or
even
better
the
st
ambroise

but
this
is
a
fairly
inoffensive
macro
substitute
that
i
might
consider
purchasing
again

the

you
right

which
of

in

with
a

the

is
of
the
same
with
lots
of
raspberries
with

you
might
think
and
is
a
good

brew
othis
was
a
great
mass
produced
beer
that
has
a
great
price
i
wonder
why
so
many
here
are
anti
ab
this
is
a
great
beer
the
attempt
at
crispness
is
a
little
too
strong
in
this
beer
coming
off
too
prickly
and
way
too
spritzy
though
it
is
at
least
lively
it
takes
away
from
any
smoothness
the
beer
might
be
attempting
to
convey
when
i
drink
a
beer
with
flavorings
i
like
it
to
be
subtle
the
flavors
should
meld
together
and
act
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
not
balanced
and
does
not
hit
the
mark
anywayshock

raspberry
wheat
is
a
very
decent
fruit
beernot
quite
as
good
as
their

but
still
veryvery
nice
indeed
but
i
have
to
admitthe
honey
crisp
apple
wheat
is
just
amazing
and
pretty
much
my
favorite
fruit
beer
evercheerspeace2all
during
the
summer
i
enjoy
a
fruity
wheat
bear
or
two
i
purchased
a
six
on
a
whim
and
was
thoroughly
disappointed
upon
opening
the
beer
had
a
fruity
aroma
of
raspberry
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
had
an
amber
appearance
with
lots
of
carbonation
upon
sipping
the
beer
i
noticed
a
very
sickly
sweet
taste
that
kept
on
giving
and
giving
carbonation
was
very
heavy
thus
mouthful
was
fizzy
overall
i
was
extremely
disappointed
in
this
beer
ive
had
a
few
six
packs
of
this
beer
and
like
it
a
lot
its
not
fancy
but
i
like
the
slightly
sweet
obviously
raspberry
flavor
its
almost
like
a
light
dessert
beer
but
not
so
sweet
that
you
cant
have
it
anytime
ill
probably
make
it
a
staple
everyday
beer
to
have
when
not
going
for
something
unusual
overall
a
good
fruit
beer
while
it
is
not
the
best
raspberry
beer
that
i
have
had
i
have
had
worse
much
better
than
the
regular
shock
top
i
had
this
fresh
at
the
brewery
in
st
louis
so
im
sure
my
experience
with
this
is
better
than
the
average
joe
buying
a
sixer
in
some
distant
land
this
pours
a
pink
tinted
thicker
wheat
beer
color
with
an
inch
of
dying
white
fluff
on
top
the
nose
is
really
heavy
raspberry
tart
and
fresh
really
honestly
tastes
like
fresh
fruit
too
i
am
surprised
at
the
authenticity
of
the
fruit
in
this
beer
i
thought
itd
be
all
syrupy
and
sweet
and
it
just
isnt
the
wheat
malt
is
nothing
special
but
it
is
fresh
too
and
the
yeast
comes
across
a
bit
generic
but
the
raspberry
is
the
intended
star
here
this
is
like
the
lemon
shandy
and
the
apple
version
were
at
the
brewery
very
potent
and
fresh
its
hard
for
me
to
knock
this
because
at
the
source
it
really
is
worth
drinking
a
little
sweet
a
little
thicker
than
it
needs
to
be
but
for
a
macro
its
quite
good
when
its
fresh
one
of
the
better
raspberry
beers
i
have
had
not
the
best
but
definitely
would
say
try
i
agree
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
give
to
your
lady
if
shes
not
into
beer
too
much
the
beer
aspect
of
it
is
not
to
complex
which
is
why
and
rightfully
so
its
not
outstanding
typical
ab
make
a
cheap
beer
and
put
raspberries
in
it
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
good
beer
y
time
pop
can
bring
with
you
to
a
partybeach
and
pound
a
few
down
easy
very
easy
drinking
and
for
what
its
worth
i
didnt
love
it
but
would
not
be
surprised
if
i
was
drinking
it
again
to
me
the
raspberry
taste
was
not
aftificial
and
not
overpowering
was
balanced
well
but
again
nothing
much
in
the
beer
part
of
it
overall
it
was
a
sweet
drink
and
almost
koolaidy
without
any
alcoholic
theme
i
would
drink
it
again
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
but
i
wont
buy
it
for
myself
it
seemed
like
just
an
inoffensive
beverage
although
i
did
notice
the
5
2
so
it
must
have
some
effect
after
a
few
yet
i
would
describe
it
as
basically
nothing
special
there
a
lot
of
craft
beers
i
have
been
trying
this
site
was
recommended
so
here
i
am
if
i
had
known
i
would
had
reviewed
much
sooner
look
forward
to
ufc
this
weekend
and
more
beers
to
try
not
really
beer
its
drinkable
but
way
too
artificial
and
sweet
overall
a
great
beer
i
honestly
really
like
the
taste
especially
for
the
amount
of
abv
that
it
holds
a
lot
of
people
criticize
it
for
its
strong
raspberry
influence
but
thats
what
it
is
raspberry
wheat
not
typical
wheat
beer
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
overall
not
a
very
complex
beer
a
mediocre
wheat
beer
which
is
not
improved
by
the
addition
of
raspberry
flavor
it
is
a
smooth
drinking
beer
but
the
raspberry
leaves
a
kind
of
coughdroplike
aftertaste
which
does
not
leave
me
wanting
another
kind
of
a
letdown
since
i
am
a
big
fan
of
raspberries
as
a
fruit
this
is
nothing
but
sugar
water
overall
this
is
exactly
like
those
raspberry
seltzery
bottles
of
water
you
can
buy
at
the
supermarket
if
thats
what
you
want
in
a
beer
for
taste
then
this
is
your
thing
unfortunately
this
hardly
tastes
like
beer
let
alone
some
sort
of
wheat
brew
pass
yes
overall
i
think
it
deserves
it
score
due
to
its
strong
and
mouthwatering
odor
of
raspberry
with
a
taste
to
match
o
not
much
to
the
smell
or
taste
overly
sweet
like
drinking
a
soft
drink
overall
this
beer
is
just
too
sweet
for
myself
if
you
are
a
fan
of
beers
such
as
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
or
like
wine
coolers
than
this
may
be
for
you
otherwise
i
would
suggest
looking
elsewhere
overall
this
is
among
my
favorite
everyday
wheat
beers
despite
the
artificial
raspberry
flavoring
it
is
enjoyable
cheap
and
easy
to
find
overall
i
thought
this
was
gonna
be
the
best
of
the
shock
top
offerings
based
purely
on
the
raspberry
factor
but
like
the
crew
of
the
prometheus
i
was
wrong
so
wrong
this
one
takes
the
razzie
award
pun
intended
bored
with
your
normal
cheapon
sale
beer
this
beer
is
a
fun
drink
the
thick
raspberry
taste
is
great
a
sweet
tasting
beer
for
around
7
00
a
six
pack
wheat
beer
is
always
creamier
and
thicker
than
the
normal
on
sale
beer
add
some
raspberry
flavored
sweetener
and
youve
got
shock
top
raspberry
wheat
stronger
buzz
at
5
20
compared
to
5
00
a
good
time
for
sure
taste
is
mildly
repulsive
it
is
kind
of
jammy
tasting
with
a
metallic
twang
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
like
sucking
on
a
rusty
nail
the
flavor
is
full
of
artificial
raspberry
and
does
not
leave
much
of
the
belgian
wit
in
its
wake
which
is
not
such
a
bad
idea
in
the
case
of
the
original
shock
top
i
was
waiting
to
find
this
as
a
single
to
find
out
how
bad
it
was
and
while
it
is
worth
the
1
50
for
the
experience
id
be
hard
pressed
to
finish
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
yearlong
span
overall
every
so
often
you
drink
a
beer
that
doesnt
resemble
beer
at
all
this
was
one
of
those
times
rasberry
syrup
dominates
still
there
is
a
little
more
to
it
in
the
aroma
anyway
there
are
both
better
and
worse
american
fruit
wheat
ales
out
there
it
doesnt
even
come
close
to
the
standard
belgian
fruit
beers
but
being
what
it
is
it
is
what
it
is
2
95
00
on
occasion
i
like
to
try
different
fruit
flavored
beers
raspberry
smellflavor
comes
thru
on
this
bear
quite
nicely
i
also
enjoy
wheat
beers
as
well
but
i
rank
beers
by
asking
myself
if
i
saw
a
6
pack
of
this
beer
on
sale
would
i
buy
it
answer
is
no
in
reagrd
to
this
beer
overall
i
think
budweiser
needs
to
try
a
real
raspberry
beer
like
new
glarus
or
dfh
to
see
what
raspberry
beers
can
actually
taste
like
before
dumping
a
bunch
of
sugar
and
cheap
raspberry
syrup
into
a
cheap
wheat
beer
and
then
spending
billions
on
marketing
better
beer
sells
itself
due
to
the
selfevident
quality
of
the
product
im
damn
glad
that
this
was
a
single
bottle
given
to
me
just
to
review
because
had
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
i
would
have
finished
about
half
of
one
cooked
with
the
rest
of
it
and
given
the
other
five
away
to
someone
with
no
real
concept
of
what
good
beer
is
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
good
use
of
fruit
bad
in
other
aspects
i
personally
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
this
is
certainly
a
step
in
the
right
direction
from
ab
this
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
i
reckon
rjt
overall
a
sweet
brew
with
a
good
dose
of
raspberry
flavor
it
you
want
an
affordable
berry
flavored
beer
this
would
be
one
to
take
on
poured
in
a
pint
glass
from
bottle
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
with
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
like
most
everyone
else
this
drinks
like
a
raspberry
soda
it
has
lots
of
raspberry
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
hay
malt
flavor
in
the
background
very
fizzy
and
watery
its
not
terrible
but
its
just
cloying
overall
i
actually
dont
mind
the
regular
shock
top
all
that
much
so
i
figured
id
give
this
one
a
shot
too
this
is
much
worse
than
the
regular
version
the
taste
is
way
too
sweet
and
artificial
it
was
really
hard
to
finish
this
beer
and
i
really
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
1
o
not
something
i
would
drink
again
i
always
felt
like
all
the
shocktops
ahd
artificial
flavoring
added
to
them
sort
of
like
grape
or
orange
soda
this
one
is
no
different
although
the
flavor
isnt
bad
and
i
imagine
young
girls
trying
to
break
in
the
world
of
drinking
yucky
beer
might
enjoy
it
so
if
your
a
freshman
in
college
you
may
want
to
stock
up
on
this
to
get
your
date
drunk
wink
at
the
very
least
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
its
got
a
nice
cloudy
whitegolden
body
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
raspberry
with
just
a
bit
of
grains
and
wheat
in
the
back
the
taste
really
isnt
that
bad
it
comes
on
strong
with
a
rush
of
raspberry
that
cant
help
but
wind
up
tasting
a
bit
artificial
some
more
tartness
would
really
help
here
its
too
sweet
the
raspberry
washes
away
to
a
toasty
grainy
finish
that
is
fleeting
but
still
rather
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
the
drinkability
would
be
good
but
the
artificiality
is
wearing
a
more
realistic
raspberry
note
over
that
finish
would
make
this
an
excellent
fruit
beer
as
it
stands
its
just
about
average
id
still
drink
them
at
a
party
or
if
offered
to
me
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
big
head
that
quickly
disappeared
to
not
even
a
lace
the
smell
is
strictly
tart
raspberry
the
taste
is
the
same
way
all
raspberry
no
wheat
at
all
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
nothing
to
write
home
about
2
5
a
pseudobeer
at
best
even
though
it
actually
tastes
just
fine
albeit
very
innocuous
and
definitely
inoffensive
my
surroundings
probably
influence
this
opinion
i
must
admit
a
hollow
fruit
beer
but
really
i
get
it
it
goes
down
well
enough
holds
an
above
average
booze
quotient
and
alludes
to
a
popular
fruit
im
sure
that
its
more
than
my
better
half
keeping
this
one
a
going
concern
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
similar
to
drinking
a
cheap
raspberrysyrup
winecooler
i
almost
gagged
i
love
raspberries
and
this
beer
is
not
good
before
i
review
let
it
be
known
i
do
not
mind
what
shock
top
has
produced
wheat
ipa
and
belgian
white
are
both
beers
i
do
not
mind
however
this
beer
is
just
not
good
in
my
opinion
the
taste
of
the
fruit
and
raspberry
is
overbearing
it
made
me
feel
like
i
was
drinking
juice
that
was
too
sugary
i
would
explore
other
beers
that
shock
top
has
to
offer
since
this
one
is
far
and
away
the
worst
of
what
they
have
to
offer
o
well
the
raspberry
just
comes
out
so
strong
in
the
taste
and
the
smell
that
this
is
really
hard
to
grasp
altogether
theres
better
options
out
there
similar
in
style
that
ill
look
for
over
this
i
just
sucked
on
a
store
brand
jolly
rancher
candy
this
is
the
pinnacle
to
the
embarrassment
that
st
louis
needs
to
address
and
fix
this
has
the
smell
and
taste
of
a
boxed
wine
sweetened
with
7up
artificial
everything
i
have
no
idea
of
what
to
pair
this
with
possibly
a
bottle
of
the
cheapest
vodka
one
could
find
maybe
then
a
few
college
undergrads
might
touch
it
oh
well
i
was
taught
how
to
dislike
and
apparently
society
hit
this
one
on
the
bottle
nose
caught
somewhere
between
soda
pops
wine
cooler
and
fruited
wheat
beer
this
concoction
doesnt
offend
the
palate
but
causes
a
bit
of
disruption
when
preferring
a
beer
of
real
beer
flavor
overall
its
skittlebrau
overall
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
raspberry
flavor
is
overbearing
in
my
opinion
but
its
not
bad
either
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
cloudy
wheat
color
with
a
foamy
head
which
dissipated
fairly
quickly
nice
bit
of
lacing
smell
of
raspberry
wheat
and
citrus
relatively
light
mouth
feel
decent
bodied
beer
fruity
taste
with
strong
raspberry
overtones
overall
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
poured
this
american
pale
wheat
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
a
thick
white
head
retention
was
excellent
and
it
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
much
dominated
by
raspberrys
citrus
and
malted
wheat
light
in
body
this
wheat
ale
had
a
malted
wheat
base
a
splash
of
citrus
lemon
syrupy
raspberry
and
coriander
overall
this
brew
has
mass
produced
written
all
over
it
it
is
not
the
worst
thing
i
have
sampled
from
ab
but
it
is
also
evident
that
high
quality
ingredients
are
not
being
used
the
raspberry
flavor
is
very
much
artificial
decent
attempt
at
intimidating
a
micro
brew
but
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
another
6
pack
of
prost
o
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
drinkable
a
little
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
imo
overall
the
raspberry
taste
is
pleasing
with
the
wheat
which
is
makes
it
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
every
once
in
awhile
embarressly
thats
a
new
word
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
before
i
started
rating
beers
i
still
enjoy
it
as
it
reminds
me
of
raspberry
ice
cream
good
summer
beer
overall
impression
where
did
this
come
from
ive
had
both
the
original
shock
top
and
also
the
pumpkin
version
and
they
were
not
up
to
par
at
all
this
one
was
very
nice
and
good
all
around
if
this
one
just
had
a
tad
more
body
the
flavor
could
be
more
distinct
but
of
course
im
wishing
this
often
with
many
ab
products
go
for
it
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
a
tasty
and
refreshing
raspberry
beer
this
is
my
final
review
for
the
original
three
shock
tops
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
impressed
once
again
overall
see
drinkability
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
decent
for
a
fruity
beer
but
just
mediocre
overall
at
first
the
smell
was
very
good
and
my
first
taste
was
really
good
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
is
one
that
i
really
like
and
this
is
comparable
to
a
certain
extent
the
after
taste
is
tasteful
at
first
but
after
a
minute
or
two
it
turned
sour
like
a
sour
patch
kid
i
also
disappointed
with
the
high
calorie
count
for
what
you
are
getting
179
per
bottle
this
is
different
and
unique
but
lacks
with
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
calorie
count
not
one
that
i
would
pick
for
a
six
pack
but
maybe
try
once
again
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
few
floaties
and
about
a
half
inch
white
head
the
head
doesnt
stay
around
for
long
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
raspberries
more
syrup
than
fresh
raspberries
and
some
wheat
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
all
raspberries
and
wheat
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
has
moderate
carbonation
and
it
goes
down
easy
not
too
bad
overall
id
drink
this
again
in
the
future
o
i
really
appreciate
how
reserved
the
fruit
flavors
of
this
beer
are
i
usually
shy
away
from
fruit
beers
because
the
tartness
or
sweetness
are
just
way
too
much
that
it
doesnt
seem
like
beer
anymore
this
one
strikes
a
great
balance
for
me
and
i
dont
think
its
a
bad
offering
at
all
from
ab
overall
this
is
just
an
ok
fruit
beer
about
what
a
drinker
would
expect
from
ab
chicks
would
probably
dig
it
nothing
great
but
nothing
bad
o
the
nose
has
a
great
raspberry
note
but
the
wheat
in
it
has
a
funny
funk
the
flavor
is
ok
but
the
medicinal
edge
really
hurts
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldencopper
color
with
about
a
half
inch
of
a
foamy
head
the
scent
that
stands
out
above
all
is
the
sweet
raspberries
almost
reminds
me
of
the
scent
of
a
brand
new
box
of
fruity
pebbles
the
taste
is
smooth
and
mellow
and
there
is
definetly
a
wheat
and
a
raspberry
taste
to
it
the
first
part
of
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
last
half
as
it
starts
sweet
like
a
lambic
and
finishes
like
a
dry
cheap
beer
an
interesting
concept
but
definetly
needs
some
improvement
when
compared
to
other
microbrews
but
for
an
anheuserbusch
product
this
isnt
too
bad
something
to
try
once
and
thats
about
it
this
brew
could
have
been
much
worse
than
it
was
i
was
interested
in
trying
it
since
i
just
had
the
pumpkin
one
not
too
long
ago
this
one
poured
out
much
like
the
normal
shock
top
kinda
hazy
with
a
golden
color
to
it
the
head
leaves
no
lacing
and
has
very
little
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
perfumy
almost
artificial
smelling
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
pretty
nice
flavor
to
it
i
was
actually
please
with
the
raspberry
flavor
in
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
nothing
too
stunning
here
really
overall
this
brew
was
drinkable
i
didnt
mind
having
a
second
one
right
after
the
first
i
cant
ever
see
myself
buying
it
but
for
free
its
not
too
bad
d
as
mentioned
before
this
beer
may
be
appropriate
for
those
who
dont
like
beer
really
a
pretty
poor
example
of
a
fruit
based
wheat
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
12
inch
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
artificial
raspberry
aromas
and
perfume
taste
is
of
artificial
raspberry
flavoring
and
fruit
rollups
there
is
a
perfumelike
aftertaste
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
fake
smelling
and
tasting
beer
that
is
not
even
average
in
my
book
o
as
you
can
tell
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
and
i
am
always
willing
to
try
ones
that
are
infused
with
fruit
i
would
suggest
you
should
not
waste
your
money
on
this
beer
o
honestly
not
bad
wont
make
me
a
fan
and
more
for
the
light
craft
drinker
who
likes
a
little
fruitiness
with
his
beer
but
i
can
see
the
ladies
enjoying
this
smoother
now
to
take
of
the
training
wheels
and
do
a
big
boy
style
mo
very
raspberry
but
not
much
beer
flavor
or
aroma
i
dont
like
the
artificial
fruit
flavor
this
is
a
rather
weak
beer
all
around
not
my
style
unfortunately
the
flavor
goes
the
other
direction
the
fruity
sweetness
again
dominates
and
the
only
thing
that
reminds
that
this
is
beer
is
a
dull
yeasty
earthiness
in
contrast
to
the
aroma
the
fruit
juice
flavor
starts
to
become
more
and
more
unpleasantly
artificial
with
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
tries
to
help
with
a
light
smooth
body
and
only
a
mildly
tingly
carbonation
in
the
end
however
this
just
doesnt
taste
like
beer
light
and
very
fruity
its
more
of
a
fruit
juice
spritzer
than
a
beer
its
actually
somewhat
pleasant
when
viewed
from
that
point
of
view
though
making
it
a
potentially
fine
summery
changeofpace
or
a
first
stepping
stone
towards
beer
for
a
wine
cooler
drinker
no
defense
for
this
one
the
other
one
is
alright
this
is
a
bunch
of
artificial
tasting
shite
glad
this
one
bottle
in
a
mixed
6er
my
wife
loves
this
because
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
i
only
the
other
hand
love
beer
hence
the
ba
membership
this
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
cloudy
orange
color
with
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
was
obviously
artificial
raspberry
with
a
ton
of
sweetness
taste
was
mostly
artificial
raspberry
with
a
touch
of
beer
not
really
much
to
write
about
from
a
ba
standpoint
mouthfeel
was
easy
drinking
i
hate
to
rate
this
so
high
because
its
not
so
much
a
good
brew
but
that
i
occasionally
enjoy
this
as
a
guilty
pleasure
im
sorry
overall
this
beer
is
a
mess
who
is
the
target
market
here
ladies
the
gays
my
wife
who
is
not
a
big
beer
drinker
liked
it
alot
i
actually
like
regular
shocktop
for
a
macro
brew
hef
i
think
its
pretty
damn
good
the
raspberry
is
just
so
overpowering
in
every
way
its
a
little
tough
to
drink
i
contemplated
a
drainpour
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
has
good
carbonation
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
consists
of
a
very
strong
raspberry
flavoring
along
with
some
wheat
and
maybe
some
other
sweet
flavorings
but
not
really
sure
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
fake
raspberry
taste
that
follows
some
wheat
and
some
hops
that
are
hard
to
taste
with
the
bad
raspberry
taste
in
my
mouth
the
aftertaste
has
the
bad
raspberry
taste
along
with
a
soapy
taste
that
makes
me
want
to
grab
another
beer
to
wash
the
taste
away
ill
even
take
a
busch
light
at
this
point
over
this
light
bodied
thin
watery
beer
that
should
be
discontinued
as
soon
as
possible
the
mouthfeel
seems
almost
flat
very
thin
and
watery
the
carbonation
seemed
to
be
there
in
the
pour
but
there
is
a
lack
of
it
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
crap
girlfriend
wishes
she
had
never
picked
it
up
and
was
extremely
disappointed
in
it
i
didnt
expect
much
but
this
didnt
even
meet
my
expectations
for
whatever
reason
i
found
myself
compelled
to
buy
this
bottle
yesterday
call
it
the
morbid
curiosity
of
the
ticker
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
clearly
fake
whiff
of
raspberry
a
good
and
unique
new
beer
i
enjoyed
a
glass
of
it
after
a
brewery
tour
in
st
louis
give
it
a
chance
before
you
go
bashing
it
because
it
is
an
ab
product
this
flavor
is
not
quite
as
good
as
the
belgian
white
in
my
opinion
however
i
would
purchase
this
stuff
any

sweet

who

overall
meh
its
shock
top
what
can
you
really
expect
its
by
no

great
but
it
is
refreshing
and
not
overtly
offensive
just
very
artificial
tasting
atmosphere
is
good
cloudy
golden
color
and
a
solid
head
nose
is
basic
but
kind
of
what
youd
expect
raspberry
and
wheat
flavor
is
bready
and
sweet
i
think
this
has
been
augmented
with
some
sweeteners
seems
like
it
anyway
overall
this
is
decent
quaff
these

bad
but
the
natural
raspberry
flavor
added
doesnt
do
it
for
me
not
sharp
wheat
just
soft
bready
layers
with
a
bit
of
chalky
yeast
flavors
going
on
minimal
spice
additions
hard
to
pick
up
any
one
aspect
of
the
spices
look
girls
will
love
this
stuff
but
im
not
sold
why
do
the
next
fruit
infused
wheat
beer
when
they
could
make
a
real
craft
style
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
lively
carbonation
not
bad
other
than
the
cloying
sweetness
from
the
raspberry
flavoring
overall
impression
is
this
wont
last
i
cant
believe
this
would
outsell
the
standard
superior
shock
top
appearance
is
cloudy
golden
wheat
with
a
hint
of
orange
with
a
crisp
dissapating
head
and
no
lace
smell
of
light
rasberries
spice
and
adjunct
in
the
back
taste
is
again
light
rasberries
spice
and
adjunct
with
a
sweetness
that
tags
along
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
a
refreshing
wheat
ale
that
would
go
good
on
a
warm
summer
day
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
yech
cheers
i
liked
it
better
when
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
ab
brewery
in
merrimack
you
can
still
drink
it
but
you
probably
wont
enjoy
it
if
you
enjoy
fruity
beers
this
is
pretty
tasty
if
you
want
something
totally
different
from
normal
beer
this
is
also
fairly
acceptable
the
color
of
this
beer
is
light
yellowish
the
smell
is
extremely
sweet
it
has
a
very
fruity
taste
which
can
throw
some
people
off
the
overall
taste
is
not
that
bad
after
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
im
sure
it
can
be
a
bit
much
overall
not
a
failure
o
ill
avoid
this
in
the
future
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
is
forgettable
d
this
is
a
fairly
typical
raspberry
wheat
not
good
but
not
awful
either
lemon
shandy
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
swirling
head
there
is
a
weak
soapy
aroma
the
taste
is
soapy
but
weak
lemonade
flavors
come
through
near
the
end
flat
body
weaker
flavors
overall
the
soapy
flavors
are
pretty
bad
the
brief
hints
of
lemonade
that
comes
through
are
nice
i
like
it
good
beer
light
bodied
crisp
and
potentially
refreshing
not
as
good
as
summer
shandy
but
drinkable
a
little
too
lemony
for
me
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
beer
to
be
honest
i
think
the
lemon
taste
is
good
but
was
left
wondering
where
the
beer
taste
went
i
would
drink
it
again
though
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
shandys
and
this
one
fits
the
mold
smooth
and
sweet
but
not
much
beer
and
almost
no
aroma
so
would
i
recommend
it
i
am
mixed
about
it
but
i
will
say
yes
but
only
for
summer
around
july
or
august
because
i
wouldt
buy
this
beer
during
winter
overall
its
a
much
better
beer
than
those
bud
light
lime
and
all
the
lime
beer
in
general
if
you
wanna
have
a
lemonade
lime
citrus
beer
take
this
one
no
doubt
about
it
but
if
you
wanna
have
a
beer
with
some
guts
this
one
is
definitely
not
for
you
the
crack
was
loud
and
so
i
celebrated
with
an
inverted
glug
it
produced
twoplus
fingers
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
with
extremely
limited
retention
quickly
falling
away
to
wisps
color
was
a
hazy
strawyellow
srm

update
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
morons
at
anheuserbusch
are
considering
marketing
this
dreck
here
in
canada
as
craft
beer
lie
to
us
some
more
we
love
it
jerks
overall
3
65
in
my
book
this
beer
is
a
winner
im
bumping
the
overall
score
up
because
it
really
is
inoffensive
and
refreshing
it
incorporates
the
wheat
and
the
lemonade
and
doesnt
overdo
it
on
either
and
manages
to
keep
them
both
in
check
while
complementing
each
other
leinenkugels
in
comparison
is
a
bit
too
harsh
and
while
still
decent
is
not
as
refreshing
and
pure
as
this
brew
perhaps
its
the
belgian
wheat
a
pretty
bland
shandy
the
appearance
was
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
mostly
of
the
lemonade
the
taste
was
very
tart
and
seemed
like
this
was
much
more
lemonade
than
beer
wasnt
very
blown
away
by
the
flavors
as
everything
was
overrun
with
the
lemonade
mouthfeel
was
light
but
nice
for
the
summer
overall
id
say
id
be
fine
with
it
if
i
saw
it
at
a
picnic
but
im
not
going
to
search
it
out
great
taste
and
very
refreshing
overall
the
list
of
ingredients
is
rather
off
putting
the
first
two
ingredients
to
this
thing
which
the
can
claims
is
a
belgian
style
white
beer
is
beer
and
ale
wait
how
is
beer
an
ingredient
in
beer
next
on
the
ingredient
list
is
sugar
and
a
long
list
of
words
like
flavour
and
modified
no
thanks
rjt
theres
not
much
to
hate
but
theres
not
much
to
remember
either
take
that
as
you
may
o
they
will
happily
sell
a
million
cases
of
this
to
a
bunch
of
people
who
dont
know
better
will
seek
out
and
purchase
again
although
only
on
tap
most
likely
not
bottle
can
poured
a
light
yellow
color
ale
with
a
light
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
lemon
syrup
with
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugars
is
closer
to
juice
than
beer
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
wheat
malt
notes
with
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
and
some
lemon
syrup
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
with
a
tad
too
much
sugar
thought
o
the
lemonadelemon
part
of
this
shandy
is
just
too
artificial
smelling
and
tasting
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
low
abv
just
not
a
beer
that
i
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
lemons
taste
is
lemony
light
and
refreshing
not
much
to
it
but
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
i
wouldnt
want
a
steady
diet
of
it
but
not
a
bad
warm
weather
beer
the
label
basically
tells
the
story
for
this
beer
belgianstyle
wheat
beer
brewed
with
spices
and
with
natural
lemonade
flavor
added
it
looks
like
a
standard
witbier
and
its
got
pretty
good
head
retention
and
some
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
like
a
standard
witbier
as
well
displaying
a
bit
of
coriander
and
a
hint
of
citrus
over
a
sweetish
wheaty
malt
base
the
flavor
is
where
it
deviates
if
you
read
the
label
carefully
it
states
that
it
has
lemonade
flavor
added
and
that
lemonade
flavoring
has
the
perfect
balance
of
sugary
sweetness
soft
lemon
flavor
and
delicate
citrusy
tartness
it
dominates
at
first
but
then
fades
to
reveal
the
witbier
base
in
the
finish
its
slightly
artificial
tasting
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
would
bother
you
i
dont
think
so
overall
i
think
this
makes
a
great
drink
for
summer
its
light
easy
to
drink
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
and
just
4
2
alcohol
by
volume
maybe
if
this
were
a
radler
id
be
more
inclined
to
score
it
higher
but
its
a
wheat
beer
with
very
little
beer
like
properties
overall
not
very
good
even
before
you
factor
in
the
weird
off
putting
aftertaste
this
is
bad
even
for
what
it
is
seriously
how
do
you
f
up
a
shandy
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
brew
tasted
good
and
went
down
easy
the
taste
is
way
too
lemony
and
more
like
lemonade
i
barely
pick
up
any
grain
or
malts
there
is
a
zingy
hop
kick
at
the
end
but
that
may
be
wishful
thinking
ah
well
ive
reviewed
it
o
overall
was
pretty
disappointed
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
natural
lemon
flavor
not
one
reminiscent
of
a
powdered
drink
mix
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
it
has
a
very
crisp
and
clean
taste
not
bitter
at
all
and
finishes
with
slight
lemon
flavor
i
have
tried
many
lemon
shandy
selections
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
it
is
not
easy
to
find
but
i
wish
they
would
produce
it
all
year
it
does
not
have
the
heavy
powder
lemonade
flavor
most
do
would
recommend
it
highly

oit
was
little
better
than
okay
for
a
fruit
beer
might
have
been
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clearly
this
beer
has
that
lemon
flavor
i
was
feeling
this
beer
i
bought
the
variety
case
and
this
was
a
really
good
beer
if
you
like
that
lemon
flavor
you
will
enjoy
it
i
will
note
that
beer
is
probably
better
if
you
have
one
or
perhaps
two
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
pretty
decent
for
the
type
of
beer
that
it
is
made
to
be
the
belgian
wheats
are
always
cloudy
but
this
one
was
very
bright
and
very
yellow
on
the
down
side
the
head
is
small
no
lacing
and
no
staying
power
you
can
definitely
smell
the
lemon
and
it
mixes
well
with
the
odor
of
wheat
that
i
like
so
much
it
refreshing
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
but
mostly
watery
like
you
would
expect
from
a
lemonade
so
its
sorta
hard
to
hold
it
against
them
anyway
its
a
good
shock
top
they
guys
specialize
with
the
fruitvegetable
brews
and
do
a
good
job
at
it
overall
a
very
solid
summertype
beer
a
good
price
point
for
a
solid
beer
i
like
it
and
will
probably
drink
more
of
it
in
the
warmer
months
this
may
be
the
definition
of
a
mowing
beer
o
overall
tastes
like
the
most
artificial
soapy
lemon
i
have
ever
witnessed
overall
not
too
great
there
are
much
better
shandys
out
there
this
just
wasnt
refreshing
and
a
chore
to
drink
easy
to
down
but
damn
near
water
some
of
the
shock
tops
are
passable
to
me
the
concept
of
shandys
or
radlers
are
sacrilegious
but
this
one
is
really
setting
the
bar
low
not
the
worse
lemon
beer
out
there
but
im
sure
its
leagues
away
from
being
the
best
too
id
grab
this
before
a
summer
shandy
but
thats
not
really
saying
too
much
tried
at
the
end
of
the
brewery
tour
in
st

only
one
available
i
hadnt
reviewed

bright
white
head
on
a
cloudy
but
still
bright
golden
body
musty
wheat
rice
hint
of
lemon
citrus
but
very
light
the
flavor
starts
with
rice
wheat
ad
grain
with
carbonated
not
so
fresh
lemonade
rounding
out
the
finish
light
body
and
high
carbonation
pretty
gross
beer
worse
than
i
would
imagine
lemonade
being
spiked
with
bud
light
overall
another
substandard
shock
top
brew
not
a
bad
flavor
but
the
lack
of
any
kind
of
body
leaves
this
beer
tasting
a
bit
like
lemon
water
it
pours
a
semiclear
pale
yellow
hue
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
scent
is
mild
with
creamy
wheat
and
lemon
aroma
the
texture
is
slightly
creamy
with
cheap
grains
and
lemon
hitting
the
taste
buds
rather
weakly
this
is
essentially
buds
version
to
compete
with
millers
distributed
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
its
a
decent
summer
beermaybe
i
guess
i
would
have
to
try
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
to
give
an
honest
opinion
of
which
one
is
better
but
i
have
yet
to
have
a
shandy
that
tops
potosi
steamboat
shandy
on
draft
overall
this
is
average
maybe
a
little
better
but
nothing
that
amazes
me
that
much
the
creative
label
could
use
a
beer
that
matches
it
artistry
something
about
it
just
misses
the
mark
of
being
a
true
shandy
would
be
easy
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
so
would
lemonade
despite
a
slight
artificial
sweetness
to
it
its
not

not

tastes
like
those
caramel
apple
pops
i
used
to
get
in
my
halloween
bag
great
beer
crisp
and
clean
flavor
good
beer
but
way
to
sweet
maybe
serve
it
with
some
sharp
cheddar
cheese
to
level
things
off
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
way
to
purchase
it
again
overall
if
you
like
apples
you
can
drink
one
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
so
i
dont
come
across
as
a
snob
but
i
would
never
buy
it
great
cider
definitely
will
buy
again
you
can
really
taste
the
apple
upfront
like
a
cider
but
then
has
the
finish
of
a
traditional
wheat
beer
just
plain
awful
drain
pour
great
apple
smell
strong
apple
taste
a
bit
too
bubbly
in
the
mouth
not
very
beer
like
but
ok
nonetheless
o
this
barely
qualifies
as
beer
this
is
clearly
marketed
toward
the
college
crowd
looking
for
something
sugary
sweet
to
sip
on
thatll
get
them
drunk
what
sucks
is
i
cant
even
cook
with
the
remainder
of
the
beer
in
my
glass
i
dont
want
to
drink
because
i
cant
think
of
any
recipe
that
would
call
for
candy
apple
flavored
beer
found
this
in
my
fridge
from
a
party
back
in
may
eek
this
tastes
just
like
a
jolly
rancher
candy
while
i
do
love
sweet
girly
beers
this
one
is
just
not
my
thing
will
not
be
trying
this
again
this
apple
crips
has
a
wonderful
flavor
can
be
drank
year
round
awesome
sitting
next
to
a
fire
can
be
drank
with
meals
or
as
an
after
dinner
desert
beverage
honestly
this
beer
just
isnt
for
me
maybe
itd
appeal
more
to
someone
elses
palate
but
it
just
smelled
sour
and
fermentedyes
i
understand
all
beer
is
fermented
and
tasted
rank
not
quite
sweet
like
a
hard
cider
and
not
quite
like
a
wheat
beer
the
concept
just
didnt
work
for
me
and
my
palate
but
hey
maybe
itll
work
for
yours
not
as
carbonated
as
a
cider
slightly
sour
taste
overall
pretty
good
very
refreshing
the
crispness
of
the
apple
is
very
present
this
is
a
sweet
enjoyable
after
dinner
drink
that
a
non
serious
beer
drinker
will
find
non
offensive
it
is
apple
wheat
beer
mixed
with
apple
cider
it
has
a
good
taste
that
is
true
to
the
name
i
found
it
to
be
a
good
easy
drinker
while
this
is
a
good
average
beer
do
not
compare
it
to
a
cider
i
am
a
huge
hard
cider
fan
and
this
tastes
nothing
like
woodchuck
cider
or
another
reputable
hard
cider
product
bottom
line
is
that
is
just
a
sweet
easy
drinking
average
beer
that
is
great
for
a
group
of
non
beer
drinkers
bottom
line
if
you
like
cider
maybe
youll
find
it
decent
enough
but
really
just
no
tastes
a
lot
like
woodchuck
apple
cider
great
for
18
year
old
girls
too
sweet
for
me
overall
they
got
the
apple
tartness
down
but
its
brewed
with
cider
and
spices
and
it
tastes
like
it
tastes
a
bit
too
much
like
those
packages
of
instant
cider
that
you
add
hot
water
to
overall
3
49
a
little
more
watery
than
id
like
the
flavor
profile
could
be
bolder
but
whats
there
is
decent
theres
sweet
and
sour
apple
with
a
candylike
sweetness
again
like
a
jolly
rancher
and
an
undertone
of
wheat
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
theres
never
really
a
bad
time
for
one
exactly
but
its
like
all
macros
they
have
their
place
but
are
not
exceptional
in
any
category
its
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
for
friends
who
are
beer
shy
they
may
like
it
not
a
bad
combination
of
wheat
and
apple
flavoring
its
one
of
my
favorites
from
a
b
o
not
my
typical
style
choice
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
taste
like
apple
juice
or
cider
mixed
with
a
wheat
beer
3
55
overall
its
not
bad
its
nice
to
see
a
variation
obviously
its
not
as
good
as
lots
of
other
wheats
but
its
not
all
bad
overall
this
might
as
well
be
an
apple
cider
very
little
wheat
still
taste
and
smells
good
a
nice
change
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
super
sweet
jolly
rancher
smell
head
dissipated
quickly
to
nothing
very
sweet
tasted
of
candy
like
apples
but
at
the
end
you
can
tell
its
a
beer
but
just
subtly
i
liked
it
but
after
two
got
a
stomach
ache
decent
apple
flavors
kinda
of
a
mix
between
real
and
artificial
apple
flavors
overall
its
really
not
that
bad
a
tad
to
sweet
but
expecting
worse
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
prefer
the
original
version
of
shock
top
in
the
shock
top
stable
i
would
say
this
is
middle
of
the
road
as
someone
who
likes
ciders
and
most
mikes
hard
flavors
this
is
horrible
horrible
stuff
blecchhhhh
this
thing
sucks
def
a
no
go
not
smooth
and
an
odd
sour
candy
taste
to
it
this
isnt
terrible
and
exceeded
my
low
expectations
a
good
choice
if
youre
switching
around
between
ciders
alcopops
and
tuttyfruity
wheat
beers
this
tasted
like
either
really
bad
cider
or
really
bad
beer
like
budweiser
with
sour
apple
jolly
rancher
hues
two
of
them
led
to
an
upset
stomach
and
an
epic
headache
the
next
day
i
like
most
beer
on
principle
and
i
hate
to
waste
it
ever
but
the
last
four
of
these
will
get
dumped
with
extreme
prejudice
blech
o
better
than
hard
cider
but
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
inoffensive
taste
not
great
but
not
awful
either
ab
is
trying
to
convince
people
that
shock
top
is
a
craft
beer
and
thats
just
not
truth
in
advertising
this
beer
pours
with
a
finger
and
a
half
finebubbled
head
this
head
is
fluorescent
white
head
and
dissolves
quickly
this
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
the
nose
is
completely
green
apple
the
initial
taste
is
a
strong
tart
green
apple
morphing
into
a
jolly
rancher
sour
apple
sort
of
sweet
apple
flavor
acid
and
metal
tastes
are
apparent
fades
to
a
simple
satisfying
wheat
flavor
finish
its
a
nice
crisp
beer
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
overall
a
sweet
tasty
apple
drink
not
much
in
common
with
beer
nice
sweet
apple
juice
beverage
this
was
very
surprising
and
very
good
usually
i
enjoy
shiner
when
i
have
money
and
coors
when
i
dont
but
this
has
to
be
my
new
favorite
beer
apple
taste
is
not
overwhelming
and
i
would
say
kind
of
in
the
background
of
the
beer
you
do
get
a
beer
taste
but
the
apple
blends
in
very
well
highly
recommended
had
this
at
a
party
not
a
fan
of
regular
shock
top
but
wa
inticed
by
the
bright
green
can
strong
strong
smell
of
apple
juice
tastes
completely
like
jolly
ranchers
the
sour
appeared
flavor
kind
of
smells
like
it
too
is
this
actually
beer
im
pretty
sure
its
just
candy
update
worst
guy
bust
in
diarhea
ever
woke
me
up
from
a
dead
sleep
duargea
would
seek
out
and
purchase
again
sweet
and
refreshing
ciderlike
goodness
for
the
hot
summer
o
this
stuff
is
fantastic
only
minor
problem
i
have
is
that
it
should
be
labeled
a
shandy
cheers
overall
i
am
stunned
by
how
much
im
enjoying
this
line
of
beer
for
once
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
basic
marketing
ploy
but
a
genuine
attempt
at
creating
a
solid
beer
with
flavor
good
consistency
and
surprise
sucked
this
one
down
in
less
than
five
minutes
and
wish
i
had
another
smells
of
apples
honeysuckle
pours
hazy
orange
yellow
with
super
thick
white
foamy
head
good
head
retention
taste
is
almost
pure
apple
cider
overly
sweet
no
discernible
malt
or
hops
in
it
funky
flavored
think
i
would
prefer
regular
hard
cider
or
a
malternative
to
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
full
head
developed
white
with
good
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
a
slightly
hazy
golden
honey
color
aroma
was
of
apple
flavored
gum
with
come
mild
malt
notes
tasted
very
sweet
and
gummy
like
candy
apple
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
with
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
comes
in
a
nice
looking
can
overall
i
dont
know
what
to
say
here
its
not
a
wheat
beer
more
of
a
fake
apple
cider
with
a
touch
of
wheat
its
not
bad
but
its
far
from
good
i
picked
this
up
as
a
last
minute
1
am
purchase
in
oh
alcohol
sales
stop
at
1am
it
is
what
i
expected
from
shock
top
not
real
good
but
simply
overall
for
occasion
its
good
my
opinion
of
this
may
be
eschew
because
im
partial
to
the
flavor
and
im
sure
its
an
additive
and
not
natural
flavors
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
still
really
like
it
i
dont
know
what
everyone
else
was
drinking
that
say
shock
top
honeycrisp
apple
wheat
is
to
sweet
it
dont
taste
anything
like
woodchuck
either
you
take
reds
apple
ale
and
that
stuff
is
like
syrup
not
even
a
hint
of
a
beer
then
you
wrap
your
hand
around
this
shock
top
and
you
smell
the
green
apple
smell
that
reminds
you
of
a
green
jolly
rancher
then
when
you
drink
it
you
get
a
cold
crisp
non
bitter
taste
in
your
mouth
with
a
nice
suttle
back
taste
of
that
green
apple
yet
the
beer
taste
still
comes
all
the
way
through
its
perfection
compared
to
any
other
apple
beer
ive
ever
tasted
as
a
marine
ive
traveled
the
world
and
had
more
than
my
share
so
i
think
im
pretty
good
judge
sorry
boys
gotta
call
it
like
i
experience
it
and
i
dont
understand
any
of
the
other
reviews
on
this
beer
they
are
way
off
overall
i
would
recommend
this
to
women
who
like
sweeter
drinks
and
to
anyone
who
wants
to
start
trying
beer
as
an
introduction
into
this
but
that
would
be
it
o
easy
enough
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
but
there
is
something
about
the
combination
of
flavors
that
just
does
not
quite
mixed
correctly
in
my
opinion
shockingly
sweet
cider
with
a
slightly
pasty
belgian
yeast
wheat
flavor
plumbing
tip
of
the
day
if
your
water
heater
ruptures
smile
you
now
have
a
swimming
pool
for
a
basement
pumped
3000
gallons
of
water
out
of
a
basement
today
oit
smell
like
a
granny
smith
apple
then
taste
like
a
sweet
red
apple
that
end
up
leaving
a
honey
aftertaste
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
tastes
more
like
a
candy
than
a
belgianinspired
wheat
beer
as
a
previous
reviewer
noted
despite
heavy
agitation
and
an
aggro
pour
i
still
only
developed
a
pinky
finger
of
eggshellwhite
head
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishyellow
nose
smelled
of
apple
cider
so
points
for
truth
in
advertising
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
it
had
a
very
apple
cider
flavor
in
the
mouth
the
spices
lent
it
an
apple
pie
quality
and
it
was
actually
pretty
good
finish
was
semisweet
with
the
spices
keeping
it
from
being
an
outright
sugar
bomb
this
one
and
the
other
of
my
share
will
be
just
about
the
right
amount
for
this
hophead
it
was
a
novelty
and
i
do
not
regret
my
purchase
but
two
is
enough
overall
i
have
had
worse
poured
from
bottle
into
a
cup
didnt
expect
to
like
it
appearance
is
a
brownish
yellow
with
a
surprisingly
thick
head
smell
was
unappealing
taste
was
too
artificial
strong
apple
little
wheat
mouthfeel
was
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
overall
drank
half
and
got
a
stomach
ache
the
feel
is
about
right
for
this
beer
its
light
its
crisp
and
it
feels
as
much
like
a
hard
cider
as
it
smells
and
tastes
it
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
without
being
too
terribly
spritzy
though
it
starts
off
leaning
that
way
a
little
slickness
comes
through
in
the
middle
but
fortunately
cuts
out
obviously
it
tasted
like
apple
but
less
like
good
cider
and
more
like
overly
floral
cheap
apple
wine
that
had
been
carbonated
reminded
me
of
applejacks
cereal
but
in
a
bad
way
this
was
bad
applejacks
infused
bmc
light
lager
o
just
drink
cider
ya
dummy
wouldnt
really
purchase
again
but
the
apple
flavor
was
nice
as
someone
else
said
to
describe
this
it
taste
just
like
green
jolly
rancher
for
me
it
would
be
hard
to
stomach
more
than
one
of
these
it
is
for
an
aquired
taste
poured
slightly
clear
for
a
wheat
it
is
definitly
a
shock
on
the
palate
with
a
sour
taste
dont
really
get
the
honey
taste
little
fizzy
head
try
it
its
either
a
love
it
or
hate
it
mayne
ok
if
paired
with
the
right
meal
not
bad
considering
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
apple
in
a
beer
pours
a
clouldy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
strong
with
apple
and
nothing
else
taste
was
much
the
same
as
smell
like
sour
apples
not
bad
if
you
want
a
light
hard
cider
but
i
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
beer
i
like
this
one
it
has
mild
apple
taste
most
appealing
is
the
gluten
free
as
i
have
a
friend
who
has
issues
with
gluten
so
we
can
drink
this
together
its
much
better
cool
but
not
refrigerator
cold
we
had
this
on
summer
day
and
it
was
very
refreshing
and
not
heavy
like
some
beverages
can
be
for
me
this
is
great
grilled
food
beer
the
verdict
not
bad
sweeter
than
most
ciders
this
is
more
of
a
candy
apple
flavored
ale
i
love
beer
i
love
apple
cider
ive
liked
every
apple
beer
ive
tried
except
this
one
it
smells
ok
like
apples
and
cider
the
look
was
ok
it
had
a
decent
coloring
and
was
similar
to
what
i
would
expect
of
a
similar
beer
the
taste
was
what
got
me
it
didnt
taste
like
honey
crisp
apples
it
tasted
like
green
jolly
ranchers
it
was
surprisingly
unpleasant
and
saccharine
in
addition
there
was
a
bitter
note
at
the
end
of
every
sip
that
wouldnt
disappear
if
i
could
id
return
the
rest
of
the
sixpack
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
there
are
much
better
apple
beers
out
there
dear
gods
and
little
fishes
this
is
dreadful
dont
avoid
it
run
away
from
it
screaming
like
it
just
dropped
a
bucket
of
cockroaches
in
your
hair
o
this
beer
serves
a
purpose
and
would
be
refreshing
for
spring
or
summer
days
definitely
drinks
more
like
a
cider
as
the
wheat
aspect
is
overpowered
by
the
sweetness
of
the
apple
for
those
people
who
enjoy
fruit
beers
and
have
a
bit
of
an
open
minddo
yourself
a
favor
and
check
out
this
beerit
is
seasonal
so
you
cannot
get
it
year
roundthe
more
traditional
beer
drinker
may
have
a
tough
time
with
such
a
fruit
forward
beer
of
this
typeand
may
want
to
steer
clear
of
this
oneand
probably
all
shock
top
fruit
beers
because
they
are
very
fruit
forwardand
probably
way
too
over
the
top
for
a
lot
of
peoplebut
i
like
thatand
i
love
this
beercheers
and
peace2all
i
am
drinking
this
beer
right
now
as
im
writing
this
review
and
even
though
im
still
a
novice
when
it
comes
to
beer
i
can
say
this
is
easily
my
favorite
beer
very
smooth
easily
drinkable
and
great
taste
not
bitter
at
all
its
definitely
something
ill
have
to
buy
more
often
up
front
the
smell
was
okay
not
so
bad
mouth
feel
was
what
you
would
expect
from
a
cider
of
this
type
a
bit
dry
nothing
special
now
the
taste
okay
either
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
or
this
clearly
just
isnt
my
thing
but
this
was
awful
i
couldnt
even
get
half
the
bottle
down
would
not
try
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
no
comment
on
appearance
since
i
did
not
really
note
the
color
when
i
had
this
late
review
in
terms
of
smell
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
to
describe
it
is
jolly
rancher
green
apple
overly
sweet
artificial
and
overpowering
smelling
it
is
almost
like
doing
a
rail
of
apple
flavored
sugar
cocaine
no
hint
of
beer
at
all
more
of
a
juice
than
anything
if
you
made
me
smell
this
and
didnt
tell
me
what
it
was
i
would
think
it
was
some
new
sugary
kids
drink
the
taste
is
just
as
overpoweringly
sweet
think
candy
juice
spiked
with
sugary
i
will
try
and
finish
just
about
everything
and
i
like
my
sweets
just
as
much
as
the
kid
down
the
street
but
to
me
this
is
just
too
much
almost
didnt
finish
this
have
a
few
more
bottles
laying
around
that
i
unfortunaly
may
pour
down
the
drain
overall
not
terrible
but
not
great
it
might
be
competing
with
the
apple
ales
reds
and
apple
ciders
angry
orchard
on
the
market
overall
drinkability
a
decent
fall
beer
overall
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
not
by
a
long
shot
i
would
say
that
this
was
better
than
shipyards
applehead
but
i
think
if
i
am
going
to
buy
something
apple
i
will
just
buy
a
good
hard
cider
this
beer
is
really
for
people
who
may
like
that
apple
taste
to
their
beer
i
bought
the
shock
top
variety
case
and
this
one
was
part
of
the
batch
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
was
like
drinking
a
jolly
rancher
apple
i
feel
it
smelled
like
a
jolly
rancher
too
i
personally
didnt
like
it
but
some
other
people
may
love
it
i
just
gave
it
an
average
rating
to
be
fair
i
didnt
like
it
palate
disappointing
nothing
wrong
with
it
really
it
tastes
exactly
like
how
it
should
excellent
blending
in
fact
i
just
now
dont
think
cider
belongs
in
a
wheat
beer
i
think
blending
it
with
a
light
ale
would
have
done
better
this
is
a
nice
crisp
easydrinking
appley
honeyish
brew
i
only
have
a
few
beers
a
month
so
i
am
not
an
expert
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
however
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
beers
i
have
had
that
i
would
rate
as
genuinely
awful
bad
enough
to
warrant
my
first
full
review
woohoo
i
cannot
make
a
hard
and
fast
assessment
of
the
color
appearance
or
lacing
as
i
had
this
straight
from
the
bottle
the
dominant
pervasive
and
lasting
impression
both
smell
and
taste
is
that
of
an
alcoholic
jolly
rancher
the
green
apple
flavor
i
have
had
the
regular
shock
top
belgian
wheat
in
the
past
and
found
that
to
be
an
acceptable
brew
in
the
face
of
limited
options
so
i
was
pretty
disappointed
by
this
variant
a
hint
of
fruit
flavor
is
nice
but
the
anheuserbusch
people
went
way
over
the
top
on
this
one
i
wont
be
giving
it
a
second
chance
rjt
edit
not
so
good
from
the
bottle
while
the
apples
are
still
really
fresh
and
snappy
and
authentic
the
sugar
is
just
way
too
much
one
bottle
is
doable
but
a
night
on
these
is
an
awful
idea
resulting
in
diabetic
hangover
and
tooth
decay
one
is
the
right
dose
any
more
is
too
much
i
wish
this
was
dryer
way
better
at
the
source
but
still
genuine
fruit
flavor
she
was
not
interested
in
finishing
this
one
which
we
both
agreed
was
an
overlysweet
cider
beverage
the
appearance
is
very
bright
and
radical
the
smell
is
the
that
of
a
sour
apple
jolly
rancher
the
taste
is
okay
of
course
like
that
of
an
apple
however
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
bland
and
well
below
other
comparable
comparisons
it
was
nice
to
try
an
individual
bottle
but
improvement
could
definitely
be
made

abv
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
remains
the
top
for
me
in
this
category
if
you
enjoy
the
apple
beers
this
offering
is
right
up
your
alley
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
a
whiff
of
apple
fills
the
room
i
am
not
always
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
would
purchase
this
again
this
brew
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
and
if
the
price
is
right
you
should
definitely
give
it
a
try
i
like
what
abinbev
was
thinking
here
although
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wont
be
able
to
finish
this
bottle
i
can
see
casual
craft
fans
getting
their
toes
wet
here
but
the
sweetness
is
too
much
for
me
good
for
a
wine
cooler
bad
for
a
beer
overall
its
a
nice
addition
to
a
party
to
please
everyone
and
is
just
plain
tasty
d
not
surprisingly
the
green
apple
dominates
and
there
really
isnt
much
else
going
on
overall
average
beer
a
lot
like
commercial
sours
brewed
in
belgium
not
intentional
here
but
ill
take
what
i
can
get
note
that
im
a
pretty
big
cider
fan
if
youre
not
your
experience
may
be
different
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
tan
bright
floral
and
apple
scents
smells
very
refreshing
tastes
crisp
and
apple
tart
with
a
slightly
lingering
malty
finish
feels
fairly
carbonated
and
fresh
in
the
mouth
a
slight
oily
feel
afterwards
that
isnt
entirely
welcome
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
refreshing
beer
well
balanced
with
the
apple
and
the
malt
tastes
normally
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
or
shock
tops
but
i
thoughly
enjoyed
this
one
the
clouded
golden
hue
with
rocky
white
textured
head
makes
this
beer
then
comes
a
rush
of
honey
crisp
apples
at
the
grocer
in
town
they
cost
3
69
a
lb
what
a
deal
that
the
sixer
is
only
8
bucks
or
so
a
beautiful
mix
of
apple
cider
and
chalky
white
belgian
style
yeast
i
think
im
in
love
its
that
good
smells
of
fresh
apple
skins
with
the
charming
characters
that
we
all
want
in
a
beer
which
i
found
would
be
refreshment
flavor
comes
correct
with
apple
skins
and
a
fresh
juicy
honeycrisp
note
slight
hints
of
cinnamon
laying
flat
with
brown
sugared
apples
this
beer
tastes
great
not
many
shock
tops
make
me
turn
my
head
this
is
one
with
a
drying
apple
cider
effect
that
i
have
been
enjoying
since
i
found
its
magic
thanks
to
the
canquest
creator
woodychandler
for
tis
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
yes
thats
correct
bottle
even
woody
gets
a
surplus
of
those
sometimes
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
of
apple
cider
taste
has
plenty
of
apples
slightly
tart
not
much
else
but
tasty
and
very
drinkable
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
o
overall
i
think
the
concept
is
a
good
idea
but
the
execution
isnt
quite
there
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
seasonal
specialty
at
best
with
that
said
id
drink
another
one
if
it
was
around
with
so
many
great
beers
so
choose
from
i
dont
see
myself
buying
another
sixer
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
mainly
of
apple
cider
and
green
apples
with
maybe
a
hint
of
grains
taste
is
much
the
same
with
more
of
the
grain
and
some
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
much
more
like
a
cider
or
an
alcopop
than
beer
o
i
totally
get
this
point
of
this
product
combining
a
sweet
apple
cider
with
a
generic
witbier
the
problem
is
it
tries
to
be
everything
to
everyone
and
as
a
result
doesnt
do
either
the
cider
or
the
beer
aspect
well
enough
to
appeal
to
discerning
craft
beercider
drinkers
plus
the
whole
its
made
by
abinbev
thing
not
bad
for
a
malternative
though
source
purchased
at
walmart
in
texas
as
a
selection
of
a
brewmasters
choice
buildyourown
sixpack
for
8
99
very
refreshing
but
not
very
beerlike
well
this
is
definitely
an
apple
ale
theres
no
doubt
about
it
unfortunately
im
not
getting
any
of
the
spices
mentioned
on
the
label
this
definitely
isnt
for
me
but
it
does
achieve
what
it
sets
out
to
do
this
is
a
light
refreshing
offering
that
will
satisfy
your
typical
fruitbeer
drinker
or
cider
drinker
surprisingly
not
bad
the
smell
stood
out
to
me
and
was
fantastic
im
a
huge
fan
of
martinellis
sparkling
apple
cider
and
this
reminded
me
of
that
the
flavor
was
nice
apple
forward
ends
dry
for
some
odd
reason
i
kept
getting
whiskey
notes
and
some
heat
as
i
swallowed
for
5
2
i
shouldnt
notice
any
heat
at
all
but
i
got
some
slightly
heavy
for
me
i
like
really
light
wheat
beers
and
this
was
too
heavy
for
my
liking
however
it
wasnt
an
offensive
mess
like
the
raspberry
wheat
and
its
not
something
id
turn
down
especially
in
the
summer
i
wouldnt
rush
to
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
but
if
theres
nothing
at
the
bar
or
at
a
bbq
why
not
overall
this
is
a
simple
fruit
beer
but
pretty
good
the
wheat
flavors
brings
it
back
into
the
beer
realm
from
the
juicy
apples
flavors
that
had
me
thinking
it
was
basically
a
hard
cider
i
walked
into
my
local
beer
distributor
the
other
day
and
smelled
apples
lo
and
behold
there
on
tap
was
shock
top
honeycrisp
apple
wheat
i
poured
myself
a
glass
and
had
a
look
it
looked
like
fresh
cider
not
much
head
and
it
smelled
like
apples
even
more
so
than
fresh
cider
it
was
sweet
and
it
tasted
like
apples
albeit
fake
apples
i
didnt
find
much
wheat
and
i
didnt
find
much
spice
some
light
cinnamon
and
maybe
some
vanilla
in
fact
i
didnt
find
it
much
like
beer
at
all
still
it
was
interesting
and
i
knew
my
wife
would
like
it
and
since
i
was
headed
to
an
outdoor
party
i
considered
it
quite
seriously
in
the
end
i
passed
it
by
but
i
will
consider
it
in
the
future
i
could
see
it
as
an
interesting
beer
to
have
onhand
at
thanksgiving
overall
shockingly
amazing
shockingly
delicious
with
apple
flavour
o
its
a
fine
cider
but
not
at
all
a
witbier
maybe
a
fruit
beer
o
umm
im
not
even
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
is
it
bad
no
not
exactly
as
a
beer
it
makes
a
pretty
decent
cider
but
since
i
wanted
a
beer
id
have
to
say
it
fails
seems
like
an
ab
attempt
to
trick
people
into
drinking
cider
could
not
be
happier
with
a
random
loose
beer
i
got
to
try
the
other
day
the
honeycrisp
apple
wheat
for
shock
top
smells
perfect
and
tastes
even
better
i
could
not
have
had
a
better
first
taste
of
a
beer
in
my
entire
life
the
apple
is
a
slight
hint
but
a
nice
fresh
aftertaste
highly
recommended
and
a
must
try
o
i
feel
like
this
could
be
an
interesting
beer
if
the
jolly
rancher
sweetness
wasnt
present
throughout
the
nose
and
taste
it
overpowers
anything
else
the
beer
is
trying
to
do
and
gets
cloying
after
a
couple
the
cider
has
a
nice
influence
but
again
its
just
overpowered
by
the
sweetness
aside
from
being
brewed
with
wheat
there
really
arent
much
wheat
characteristics
either
leave
this
one
for
the
faux
crowd
overall
its
not
bad
i
would
have
appreciated
something
more
than
a
dominating
apple
flavor
i
realize
its
mixed
with
cider
but
if
the
ciders
going
to
utterly
dominate
the
ale
id
just
as
soon
drink
cider
im
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
dont
see
the
point
of
this
one
o
flavorwise
this
beer
is
nothing
like
a
wit
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
who
like
very
strong
fruity
sodas
like
fanta
fruit
flavored
jones
soda
or
fans
of
jolly
ranchers
i
like
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
way
over
the
top
great
color
out
of
the
bottle
small
head
but
with
good
lacing
the
smell
just
blew
me
away
it
was
pure
honey
and
apples
so
much
so
you
might
think
you
were
drinking
one
of
those
hard
ciders
but
with
better
taste
i
like
the
carbonation
on
this
one
and
was
glad
to
find
there
was
little
aftertaste
the
beer
is
deceptive
be
careful
or
youll
end
up
guzzling
it
thinking
it
were
apple
juice
overall
i
scored
it
a
bit
low
since
this
is
a
beer
rating
site
and
it
ended
up
being
more
of
a
hard
cider
like
i
mention
above
rather
than
a
fruit
flavored
beer
drinks
fairly
easy
but
a
bit
too
sweetfake
for
my
liking
this
would
do
me
fine
in
the
summer
in
a
pinch
but
only
for
one
or
2
at
the
most
certainly
not
a
wit
o
i
might
be
alone
on
this
one
but
i
really
dig
this
shock
top
its
got
a
ton
of
real
honey
crisp
apple
flavor
once
again
my
favorite
variety
of
apple
by
far
with
nice
little
spice
notes
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
its
almost
ciderlike
but
has
enough
malt
and
wheat
character
to
keep
it
grounded
as
a
beer
though
not
a
witbier
its
probably
the
fastest
ive
finished
my
review
bottle
and
im
surprisingly
sad
i
dont
have
any
more
if
this
is
around
in
the
summer
time
it
would
just
kill
it
the
cider
flavor
which
is
this
beers
biggest
distinction
and
strength
also
doubles
as
its
weakness
i
might
buy
it
again
for
a
varied
social
gather
or
on
a
rare
occasion
but
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
typically
like
to
chill
with
its
much
more
like
a
hard
apple
cider
overall
i
was
pretty
indifferent
about
this
beer
i
didnt
love
it
but
it
wasnt
horrible
i
think
its
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
i
wish
the
wheat
base
stuck
out
a
little
more
and
was
cleaner
and
the
apples
could
be
toned
down
a
little
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
but
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
and
the
flavors
didnt
hold
my
attention
for
long
at
all
one
is
enough
for
me
before
its
time
to
move
on
to
something
else
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
nice
and
i
liked
the
extra
carbonation
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
wheat
base
wasnt
better
and
stuck
out
more
it
was
more
of
an
artificial
apple
bomb
than
a
wheat
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
cheap
but
it
really
isnt
anything
i
enjoyed
and
i
might
recommend
it
to
shock
top
lovers
but
thats
it
all
i
all
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
it
wasnt
horrible
but
it
didnt
have
enough
qualitys
to
convince
me
this
was
a
decent
wheat
beer
i
like
that
shock
top
is
trying
new
things
but
this
one
didnt
work
out
better
luck
next
time
not
bad
enjoyable
but
definately
not
a
session
beer
a
little
too
sweet
and
cloying
if
you
have
more
than
3
or
4
definately
an
interesting
brew
cheers
o
wouldnt
buy
again
thanks
sam
and
vicky
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
and
while
certainly
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
ive
had
its
not
tasteless
or
bad
by
any
means
cant
wait
for
the
macintosh
and
granny
smith
spinoffs
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
brassstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
red
apple
flesh
lightlyfunky
wheat
and
a
very
light
whiff
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
a
mixture
of
vanilla
and
cinnamon
reminds
me
of
my
favorite
air
freshener
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
vein
of
mild
orange
zest
the
wheats
funk
increases
near
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
kinda
surprisingly
not
that
bad
though
i
can
see
how
the
apple
flavor
can
be
a
bit
much
for
some
people
though
i
didnt
totally
like
or
dislike
this
stuff
i
will
say
i
found
it
enjoyable
enough
where
i
wouldnt
necessarily
turn
down
a
free
followup
bottle
cheers
not
really
a
witbier
id
probably
rate
this
respectably
as
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
the
girlfriend
loves
it
but
this
just
isnt
for
me
bought
this
at
a
local
chain
grocer
in
hillsboro
nh
being
a
slight
fan
of
sts
other
brews
bud
hasnt
completely
screwed
it
up
yet
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
the
raspberry
most
of
them
have
been
pretty
meh
but
for
a
cheap
beer
for
the
masses
which
i
normally
despise
its
not
bad
i
suppose
if
im
down
to
my
last
8
and
want
a
dwcent
6er
id
buy
it
again
this
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
there
is
a
strong
scent
of
granny
smith
apples
with
a
slight
hint
of
wheat
the
initial
flavor
of
this
beer
is
more
like
a
hard
cider
with
a
sweet
tangy
apple
taste
it
isnt
until
well
after
swallowing
you
begin
to
get
a
beer
taste
from
it
it
finishes
rather
chalky
and
slightly
sour
this
is
really
more
of
a
cider
than
a
beer
folks
surprisingly
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
perhaps
my
expectations
were
set
too
low
to
begin
with
it
lacks
a
big
flavor
punch
but
its
still
pretty
taste
and
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
or
menacing
i
could
actually
see
this
working
better
in
the
summer
time
not
sure
why
it
was
released
in
january
overall
this
is
more
cider
like
in
nature
then
beer
like
it
is
sweet
and
apple
heavy
in
flavor
with
light
hints
of
wheat
and
yeast
if
you
are
looking
for
something
cider
like
then
this
is
not
a
bad
go
to
overall
reminds
me
of
a
cider
with
less
tartness
spices
are
reminiscent
of
winter
brews
but
not
as
bold
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
quickly
fading
head
smells
of
malts
with
hints
of
strawberry
smooth
balanced
lager
with
a
mild
sweetness
from
the
strawberries
coming
through
at
the
end
no
bitter
aftertaste
or
malt
drink
weirdness
light
body
with
light
carbonation
that
is
easy
to
drink
a
good
summer
beer
not
much
strawberry
going
on
taste
and
smell
reminiscent
of
miller
light
crisp
clean
sweet
simple
lager
almost
no
strawberry
taste
this
is
a
simple
easydrinking
and
pretty
tasty
beer
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
flavor
and
mouthfeel
its
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
watery
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
every
day
but
it
hits
the
spot
when
its
85
degrees
and
muggy
outside
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
when
i
first
smelled
this
i
almost
forgot
i
had
a
strawberry
beer
there
is
only
a
faint
hint
of
strawberry
but
a
strong
bread
yeast
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
where
things
get
better
more
of
a
bold
strawberry
but
again
not
a
huge
presence
suffice
it
to
say
i
do
not
find
it
very
sweet
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
kick
back
and
drink
with
non
beer
friends
i
enjoy
having
one
of
these
for
an
easy
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
will
purchase
another
6
pack
for
such
occasions
overall
a
very
nice
warm
weather
beer
and
i
must
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
finish
was
a
bit
offputting
at
first
but
the
more
you
drink
the
more
the
strawberry
flavors
envelops
everything
4
25
paws
i
love
this
beer
as
a
desert
beer
smells
terrible
almost
taste
worse
a
great
seasonal
beer
love
it
in
the
spring
recommend
highly
when
available
on
tap
bottle
version
does
not
provide
same
flavor
pours
a
yellow
orange
haze
smells
of
strawberry
and
of
malts
and
surprise
it
has
a
strong
strawberry
taste
with
a
malty
finish
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
get
a
six
pack
every
year
drink
it
cold
and
fresh
out
of
a
ten
i
give
it
a
strong
7

tastes
like
strawberry
yogurt
odd

faint

pours
clear
yellow
orange
with
small
white
head
smells
of
strawberry
malty
yeast
tastes
of
creamy
strawberries
with
slight
malt
smooth
mouthfeel
reminded
me
of
strawberry
captain
crunch
excellent
brew
abita
mix
with
andygator
or
turbodog
awesome
beer
with
a
smooth
finish
absolutely
delicious
can
never
wait
til
it
gets
released
each
year
after
tasting
purple
haze
i
was
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
its
not
as
refreshing
as
i
expected
and
the
strawberry
flavors
were
a
bit
muted
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
drinkable
not
exceptional
but
i
think
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
was
an
ok
beer
not
much
going
on
would
not
buy
again
unless
i
had
no
other
choice
nice
fruit
beer
strawberry
notes
are
not
heavy
and
the
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
hops
could
be
bolder
and
i
guess
citrus
hops
would
perfectly
match
this
overall
interesting
beer
fruity
and
creamy
flavored
but
not
really
creamy
in
mouthfeel
just
an
interesting
beer
many
fruit
strawberrys
in
beer
love
hold
and
taste
and
drink
so
abita
help
beer
with
sweet
also
hopfruit
green
label
enjoy
so
good
also
ran
i
have
to
keep
giving
away
not
a
lunch
or
a
dessert
beer
either
overall
this
beer
is
fine
although
it
really
doesnt
float
my
boat
wellenough
made
it
just
doesnt
have
a
strong
appeal
pours
a
fairly
clear
medium
straw
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
aromas
of
strawberry
but
a
bit
on
the
subtle
side
light
spice
lemon
and
just
a
touch
of
yeasty
funk
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
yeasty
wheaty
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
funk
with
a
solid
hit
of
strawberry
to
add
a
bit
of
complexity
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
nice
fruity
light
easy
drinking
summer
ale
i
quite
enjoyed
it
not
for
everyone
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
in
the
springtime
this
can
be
a
nice
treat
every
once
and
a
while
the
abita
strawberry
is
a
really
good
tasting
beer
it
is
not
too
strong
or
too
light
you
can
taste
the
strawberry
flavor
that
it
has
the
smell
is
really
good
as
well
the
taste
is
not
too
strong
or
to
light
if
you
have
not
had
this
beer
you
should
try
it
if
you
like
strawberry
flavored
drinks
overall
the
strawberry
flavoring
gives
a
unique
and
pleasant
twist
to
a
summer
lager
but
id
enjoy
this
for
its
variety
rather
than
as
my
main
brew
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
at
ye
ole
spirits
i
tend
to
like
the
fruit
beers
more
than
most
so
i
was
optimistic
going
in
the
beer
looked
like
a
lite
beer
when
poured
not
a
lot
of
color
or
thickness
to
it
not
much
to
offer
to
the
nose
which
was
a
little
disappointing
no
fruit
smell
and
not
much
else
flavor
was
also
a
disappointment
kinda
like
rotten
strawberries
in
a
cheap
beer
from
a
guy
who
likes
fruit
beer
this
is
one
that
i
will
not
buy
again
and
would
only
drink
if
i
was
on
a
quantity
night
overall
not
bad
but
really
nothing
notable
here
its
a
relatively
boring
base
beer
with
an
artificial
though
not
offensive
strawberry
presence
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
though
so
if
thats
all
youre
looking
for
then
i
guess
its
worth
a
try
not
my
favored
style
and
definitely
not
a
go
to
but
would
make
for
an
occasional
cap
off
to
a
evening
on
the
patio
in
the
summer
overall
it
was
interesting
and
didnt
offend
not
a
style
of
beer
id
go
back
to
however
strawberries
are
the
most
notable
flavor
which
is
as
it
should
be
considering
what
it
is
the
toasted
malts
are
there
and
it
finishes
clean
and
crisp
this
fits
into
the
style
well
o
nice
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
fruit
flavor
and
not
a
lot
of
associated
sweetness
refreshing
and
a
nice
beer
for
a
warm
spring
evening
flavor
tastes
exactly
as
i
would
expect
a
strawberry
wheat
lager
to
taste
the
strawberry
flavor
is
evident
as
is
grassy
wheat
yeasty
bread
and
lightly
toasted
malt
overall
first
impression
of
the
brew
was
pretty
off
putting
it
started
to
grow
on
me
throughout
the
glass
but
still
not
something
id
order
again
i
almost
never
drink
a
beer
with
fruit
in
it
but
was
assured
that
abita
had
done
it
really
well
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
the
first
pour
was
a
happy
surprise
as
the
beer
was
a
nice
golden
hue
instead
of
a
fake
red
dye
or
something
i
gave
a
sniff
and
was
able
to
pick
up
on
the
abundance
of
strawberries
but
also
the
wheat
and
barley
which
immediately
screamed
spring
to
me
the
taste
was
smooth
with
a
nice
amount
of
strawberries
through
out
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
if
you
are
a
staunch
opponent
to
fruity
beers
than
this
probably
isnt
the
beer
that
will
change
your
world
view
but
it
is
very
nice
o
hey
it
is
what
it
is
a
strawberry
wheat
and
it
is
very
good
at
being
that
worth
looking
for
if
you
like
the
style
im
a
big
fan
of
the
purple
haze
and
had
hoped
this
may
emulate
it
a
bit
with
just
a
different
flavor
but
it
falls
far
short
of
that
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
best

moderately

overall
this
is
a
nice
fruited
lager
style
good
balance
and
robustness
of
strawberry
and
bready
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
this
beer
has
very
little
flavor
and
the
strawberry
character
is
a
bit
artificial
it
was
not
that
it
has
lots
of
bad
flavor
but
it
just
has
no
flavor
o
certainly
worth
a
try
and
better
than
many
of
the
spring
seasonals
out
there
overall
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
if
someone
else
had
some
i
would
drink
it
but
i
dont
know
if
its
something
i
would
seek
out
its
a
decent
beer
but
thats
about
it
worth
the
try
though
call
me
a
girly
girl
but
this
is
seriously
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
i
love
the
light
airy
quality
of
all
of
abitas
beers
as
a
louisiana
native
i
can
testify
that
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
amazing
water
quality
in
abita
springs
where
their
other
major
industry
is
bottled
water
the
clean
crisp
refreshing
flavor
of
an
abita
strawberry
harvest
is
absolutely
delightful
not
to
mention
the
strawberries
are
fresh
from
one
town
over
and
leave
a
very
strong
strawberry
aftertaste
in
ones
mouth
i
am
thankful
that
this
seasonal
beer
is
usually
lingering
on
the
shelves
for
about
half
of
the
year
im
not
sure
what
the
rave
is
about
this
one
it
doesnt
taste
remotely
like
a
lager
or
any
kind
of
beer
for
that
matter
instead
of
the
fruit
collaborating
with
the
other
flavors
this
beer
really
doesnt
have
much
in
ways
of
hops
or
malt
it
has
some
wheat
flavors
and
grain
but
that
is
all
overpowered
by
the
strawberry
the
mouthfeel
is
its
main
problem
though
as
this
is
extremely
thin
even
for
a
summer
beer
and
the
carbonation
is
too
high
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
terrible
investment
is
that
the
strawberry
flavor
tastes
natural
unlike
in
many
overly
thin
fruit
beers
and
is
not
excessively
sweet
but
when
looking
at
this
beer
overall
and
especially
when
considering
that
it
costs
around
10six
pack
its
very
disappointing
a
better
name
for
this
beer
would
be
miley
cyrus
malt
liquor
or
freshman
15
ale
golden
straw
colored
in
appearance
just
a
bit
of
foam
remains
after
the
pour
looks
like
a
craft
brewed
lager
the
aroma
is
purely
fresh
strawberries
not
overwhelmingly
done
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
tastes
like
strawberries
and
light
malt
more
strawberries
in
the
aftertaste
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
had
a
number
of
abitas
offerings
so
far
and
havent
been
overly
impressed
but
this
one
was
nice
for
what
it
is
its
a
strawberry
fruit
beer
and
thats
exactly
what
you
get
not
too
overwhelming
with
the
fruit
flavor
nice
aroma
nice
color
very
drinkable
at
4
2
a
fruit
beer
that
is
not
overwhelming
like
most
fruit
beers
out
there
today
nice
smell
very
light
but
you
get
a
good
whiff
of
strawberry
in
the
nose
at
first
sip
the
malt
is
all
there
but
literally
14
of
a
second
later
the
strawberry
kicks
in
on
the
middle
of
your
tongue
it
also
runs
down
your
throat
slightly
which
is
nice
mouthfeel
is
about
normal
nothing
superb
a
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
hops
but
nothing
major
overall
a
good
beer
and
the
best
and
only
strawberry
beer
ive
tried
to
me
a
balance
is
everything
and
this
beer
is
not
overwhelming
on
any
part
would
definitely
recommend
to
fruit
beer
lovers
they
are
also
located
close
to
home
so
thats
nice
as
well
it
is
what
it
is
a
strawberry
beer
and
at
that
it
does
a
good
job
i
know
when
i
think
new
orleans
strawberries
strike
my
brain
first
in
association
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
sunrise
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
an
adept
recreation
in
liquid
of
a
strawberryflavored
poptart
crust
and
all
the
taste
generally
brings
more
of
the
same
though
theres
more
of
that
crust
flavor
and
a
touch
of
berry
tartness
near
the
finish
which
oddly
enough
seems
out
of
place
given
the
pervasive
feeling
of
sweetness
throughout
it
also
kinda
stabs
out
an
unnatural
lightning
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
an
okay
beer
at
best
but
one
that
just
doesnt
quite
sit
all
that
well
with
me
thankfully
the
strawberry
flavor
isnt
truly
an
artificial
one
but
its
not
altogether
pleasant
either
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
clean
and
easy
drinkingrefreshing
not
something
i
see
myself
getting
into
and
buying
but
it
was
nice
to
have
a
go
at
and
at
least
say
i
tried
it
overall
a
nice
strawberry
lager
that
balances
well
with
spicy
foods
like
boiled
crawfish
but
being
from
louisiana
i
may
be
a
little
bias
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
nice
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
strawberry
beers
that
i
have
had
unlike
other
fruit
beers
that
ive
tried
the
strawberry
flavor
is
natural
tasting
and
not
syrupy
or
candylike
definitely
worth
trying
o
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
care
what
others
think
i
look
foward
to
its
release
each
year
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
not
overly
sweet
and
the
stawberries
and
done
very
well
in
it
the
beer
is
pretty
one
note
but
its
a
delicious
clean
crisp
mild
strawberry
note
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
very
drinkable
note
this
is
a
rereview
a
year
or
so
ago
i
had
rated
this
at
a
3
53
i
dont
know
what
i
was
smoking
at
that
time
i
really
warmed
up
to
this
one
in
recent
times
and
i
now
put
back
almost
a
case
throughout
the
summer
working
it
in
that
often
actually
says
a
lot
considering
my
promiscuous
drinking
habits
t
i
was
worried
this
would
be
too
sweet
since
the
aroma
of
strawberries
was
pretty
heavy
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
crisp
and
fruity
and
balanced
not
too
sweet
not
really
hoppy
but
very
refreshing
belowaverage
hard
to
finish
doesnt
even
spell
refreshment
avoid
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
fruit
beer
it
had
enough
fruit
flavor
to
stay
true
to
the
name
and
they
didnt
taste
overly
artificial
it
seems
to
have
decent
balance
also
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
but
i
think
they
would
start
to
wear
on
me
after
a
while
one
seems
to
be
enough
for
me
i
dont
think
i
would
want
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
nice
and
very
dessert
like
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
lagers
are
usually
pretty
drinkable
but
this
one
doesnt
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
in
the
summer
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
light
and
refreshing
fruit
beer
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
really
like
strawberrys
or
somebody
who
is
just
getting
into
craft
beer
all
in
all
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
its
not
for
everyone
but
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
especially
at
a
bbq
in
the
summertime
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
but
im
still
not
crazy
over
it
or
the
brewery
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
abita
really
hooked
this
beer
malt
beverage
up
with
a
ton
of
strawberry
flavor
i
like
it
this
beer
pours
cloudy
there
is
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
sour
smelling
but
not
offputting
taste
is
really
crisp
with
a
pretty
huge
strawberry
finish
i
try
to
pick
some
of
this
up
every
year
when
its
around
pours
a
hazy
light
yelloworange
with
a
foamy
light
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
earthy
strawberry
and
strawberry
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
flavor
on
the
finish
that
is
almost
like
a
biscuit
with
butter
and
strawberry
jelly
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
but
the
smell
on
this
one
is
better
than
the
taste
o
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
syrupy
fake
taste
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
particularly
its
strawberry
flavors
since
they
seemed
unique
and
didnt
have
any
sweetness
this
is
actually
a
rather
decent
beer
the
strawberries
are
pretty
much
the
only
flavor
that
comes
through
and
its
sweet
and
a
bit
syrupy
but
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
its
like
strawberries
and
cream
the
flavor
reminds
me
exactly
like
strawberry
ice
cream
this
isnt
a
fantastic
beer
and
certainly
not
one
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
at
once
but
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
change
of
pace
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
may
pick
it
up
again

the
verdict
not
bad
better
balanced
than
many
fruit
beers
and
the
berries
dont
taste
artificial
abita
was
my
first
taste
of
craft
beer
so
theyll
always
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
overall
a
very
surprising
beer
i
liked
it
single
finger
white
head
with
poor
retention
on
a
hazy
pale
golden
body
aroma
of
strawberry
and
raspberry
with
a
grain
base
which
isnt
that
sweet
flavors
are
also
of
strawberry
and
raspberry
sweetest
in
the
finish
with
a
very
light
malt
and
grain
base
also
has
orange
peel
notes
light
body
and
high
carbonation
this
one
is
refreshing
not
too
sweet
not
a
beer
or
a
style
for
me
upon
first
pour
theres
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
little
to
no
lacing
unlike
the
raspberry
beers
ive
been
having
lately
theres
no
pink
or
reddish
color
to
it
its
a
slightly
cloudy
light
golden
yellow
with
visible
active
carbonation
on
the
nose
is
you
guessed
it
strawberries
but
also
a
little
bit
of
wheat
on
first
sip
i
remember
how
easy
it
is
to
put
these
away
on
a
hot
day
i
was
discussing
today
how
i
have
a
hard
time
drinking
heavy
beers
in
the
summer
and
its
because
of
how
easy
these
types
of
beers
go
down
in
the
heat
theres
definite
strawberries
on
the
taste
but
its
not
overwhelming
the
carbonation
is
pleasant
its
almost
like
the
beer
taste
stands
up
to
the
strawberries
its
not
syrupy
or
sweet
like
some
fruit
beers
its
what
i
would
call
well
balanced
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
kind
of
fun
very
fruit
forward
but
not
very
beer
like
either
its
a
fun
beer
once
in
awhile
but
cant
say
i
really
desire
it
but
i
wont
turn
it
down
o
a
tasty
light
great
smelling
fruit
lager
abitas
strawberry
harvest
is
not
too
tough
to
handle
and
isnt
artificial
in
any
way
i
can
sense
i
liked
the
blend
of
wheat
light
grains
and
faint
strawberries
throughout
the
brew
the
4
2
abv
is
highly
sessionable
and
i
could
see
have
a
few
on
a
sunny
bayou
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
summer
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
my
closest
comparison
is
a
warm
strawberry
muffin
while
enjoyed
the
summery
feel
to
the
beer
and
its
very
light
flavors
i
cant
bring
myself
to
drink
more
than
two
in
a
row
as
after
awhile
it
starts
becoming
overwhelmingly
sweet
however
its
definitely
a
relaxing
beverage
i
was
especially
impressed
with
the
amount
of
strawberry
flavor
m
nice
and
crisp
with
good
coating
high
drinkablilty
decent
summer
fruit
ale
but
too
light
for
me
a
friend
gave
this
one
to
me
it
poures
a
nice
hazy
yellow
color
body
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissappears
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
very
inviting
of
sweet
strawberry
and
wheat
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
of
strawberry
then
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
the
wheat
comes
to
play
the
mouth
feel
is
very
good
well
carbonated
nice
and
smooth
easy
drinking
and
a
nice
after
taste
of
strawberries
overall
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
overall
refreshing
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
a
great
summer
brew
for
a
nice
hot
day
outside
while
sitting
with
friend
and
chatting
mystery
beer
left
over
by
one
of
the
roommates
in
the
kitchen
fridge
no
idea
how
old
this
guy
is
but
im
daring
enough
to
find
out
pours
a
slightly
see
thru
golden
color
some
bubbles
ascending
and
some
head
to
it
well
at
least
it
isnt
flat
very
faint
stale
corn
aroma
taste
is
medium
bodied
slightly
tart
some
strawberry
on
the
back
end
pretty
well
balanced
and
refreshing
a
nice
subtle
fruit
beer
that
isnt
overbearing
like
a
lot
of
others
a
nice
summer
beer
would
like
more
alcohol
but
its
a
pleasant
beer
and
something
id
like
more
of
in
the
warmer
months
the
mouth
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
decent
carbonation
the
beer
is
light
semisweet
and
pretty
refreshing
between
this
on
purple
haze
which
i
prefer
over
this
one
the
brewer
has
fruit
beers
down
overall
this
is
an
extremely
refreshing
beer
and
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
had
i
could
drink
this
like
water
on
a
hot
day
pretty
good
brew
great
summer
beer
that
has
nice
refreshing
qualities
and
a
nice
sweetness
and
strawberry
flavor
to
it
o
a
decent
thirst
quenching
beer
its
a
lager
first
a
wheat
beer
second
and
the
strawberries
are
present
in
a
distant
third
im
more
impressed
by
abitas
purple
haze
raspberry
wheat
beer
oi
enjoyed
this
beer
despite
it
being
lighter
in
body
and
flavor
than
anticpated
and
having
wheat
which
i
typically
dont
care
for
worth
trying
if
you
like
fruit
and
wheat
beers
not
sure
that
i
will
purchase
again
but
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
rest
of
the
6pack
during
hot
summer
nights
overall
this
is
a
summertime
beer
i
enjoyed
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
nice
fruit
flavored
beer
not
bad
atall
something
that
was
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
night
o
heard
good
things
but
not
really
a
fan
of
this
would
not
pick
it
up
again
o
very
good
refreshing
summer
beer
absolutely
worth
having
again
strawberry
harvest
lager
is
average
beer
at
best
it
doesnt
feature
very
strong
aromatics
or
a
notable
flavor
its
not
a
complete
disaster
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
very
well
either
im
not
a
fan
of
the
buttery
flavor
that
seems
to
linger
throughout
eh
worth
a
try
maybe
if
youre
into
fruity
beer
yeahprobably
so
abita
strawberry
harvest
lager
is
a
hazy
sparkling
very
pale
golden
lager
with
a
small
white
head
that
vanishes
very
quickly
it
has
a
faint
aroma
of
fruit
and
grass
it
smells
like
a
wet
barrel
theres
a
little
sweetness
in
the
nose
and
strawberries
are
detected
its
light
bodied
and
lively
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
its
very
lightly
flavored
strawberry
jam
is
the
primary
flavor
its
just
a
little
bit
sweet
and
not
bitter
at
all
this
is
barely
beer
but
its
fun
to
drink
this
is
one
of
those
things
you
can
just
slam
out
in
the
hot
sun
lighter
body
with
a
refreshing
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
a
nonfactor
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
expected
an
artificial
strawberry
flavor
but
this
seemed
much
more
ripe
and
juicy
o
well
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
by
abita
so
i
dont
want
to
bust
on
them
too
much
however
this
isnt
necessarily
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
o
what
abita
has
here
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
for
someone
who
says
i
dont
like
beer
for
me
ill
pass
on
another
though
i
like
the
idea
of
fruitinfused
lagers
i
just
wish
they
were
done
in
a
more
lambicmeetshelles
fashion
i
really
hope
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
better
than
this
and
this
was
just
not
right
for
whatever
reason
probably
the
shortest
review
ive
written
to
date
thats
not
just
a
coincidence
tasty
beer
but
it
is
very
much
light
in
flavor
and
body
an
excellent
beer
for
hot
weather
light
crisp
resfreshing
good
summer
beer
the
aroma
and
taste
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
nevertheless
still
wonderful
i
guess
if
you
dont
drink
many
fruity
beers
maybe
i
can
see
the
bold
strawberry
notes
i
just
didnt
for
me
it
was
more
subtle
but
will
definately
have
this
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
slightly
hazy
and
a
light
reddish
yellow
color
with
a
twofinger
length
white
head
the
head
recedes
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
some
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
which
seems
to
indicate
adequate
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
pale
wheat
malt
and
strawberry
the
aroma
is
fairly
mild
and
clean
the
strawberry
flavor
immediately
hits
the
tongue
on
the
first
sip
the
wheat
malt
also
comes
through
but
the
strawberry
flavor
is
pretty
dominant
the
hop
flavor
is
very
mild
but
some
bitterness
is
present
in
the
back
end
this
helps
lend
a
little
balance
the
body
is
light
and
there
is
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
the
drinkability
is
very
high
when
you
have
one
of
these
you
can
understand
why
this
is
anticipated
as
much
as
it
is
it
is
a
solid
refreshing
beer
that
is
much
better
than
their
perennial
fruit
beer
offering
purple
haze
this
is
very
enjoyable
on
a
warm
day
or
as
an
after
meal
drink
it
really
cleans
the
palate
well
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
fruit
beer
ive
tried
o
you
want
a
strawberry
beer
this
is
the
one
for
you
strong
strawberry
flavors
dominate
and
make
this
a
great
beer
for
those
who
prefer
fruity
flavors
to
the
more
traditional
had
from
bottle
smells
like
sugary
strawberry
and
lager
malts
tastes
like
a
coors
with
strawberry
added
but
its
actually
way
better
than
that
sounds
its
slightly
sweet
but
balanced
with
the
malts
and
grains
nice
brew
but
such
a
low
abv
leaves
me
wanting
more
o
in
general
this
is
a
very
highly
drinkable
lager
that
deserves
its
place
as
a
highly
sought
after
brew
from
what
i
understand
anyways
i
did
have
a
bottle
while
in
new
orleans
and
found
it
very
nice
during
the
humid
hot
weather
and
im
reminded
of
how
good
it
really
is
i
recommend
this
one
and
think
it
is
a
high
quality
patio
beer
i
would
love
to
see
this
one
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
one
day
maybe
just
maybe
not
a
big
fruit
beer
guy
ever
but
this
one
is
just
really
good
pours
a
very
light
looking
hay
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
good
bubbles
no
pink
or
redness
to
it
really
at
all
maybe
just
a
hint
smells
a
bit
sweet
like
fresh
strawberries
and
pale
malts
crisp
flavor
is
really
lovely
tastes
like
real
fruit
nothing
artificial
or
syrupy
sweet
very
fresh
flavors
nice
crisp
finish
nothing
overboard
on
the
malt
or
hop
fronts
just
a
good
balanced
beer
that
feels
seasonally
appropriate
honestly
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
feel
is
really
light
in
body
and
very
active
on
the
carbonation
down
easy
affordable
and
yummy
this
will
assuredly
end
up
in
the
fridge
again
this
season
oavoids
the
overpowering
fruit
that
most
fruit
beers
have
light
and
refreshing
not
a
great
beer
but
a
decent
fruit
beer
o
what
a
pleasant
surprise
i
bought
a
single
of
this
not
expecting
much
i
figured
they
make
purple
haze
taste
decent
ill
give
it
a
shot
glad
i
did
i
wont
go
running
out
to
get
a
sixer
of
it
but
its
nice
to
know
that
theres
another
good
chick
beer
i
can
pull
out
of
my
pocket
when
need
be
i
treat
this
as
wine
to
compliment
dinner
or
cheese
o
a
nice
inoffensive
fruity
beer
that
you
can
drink
several
of
o
it
is
what
it
is
incredibly
mild
almost
too
much
so
smooth
but
wish
it
gave
off
more
strawberry
not
that
i
expected
much
but
definitely
not
a
brew
ill
have
often
fairly
flat
in
flavor
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
o
what
a
great
job
i
figured
this
would
be
a
drinkonce
novelty
but
im
adding
this
to
my
summer
lineup
the
strawberry
level
was
handled
expertly
its
just
there
enough
to
notice
and
appreciate
it
but
not
so
much
as
to
really
taste
like
a
strawberryflavored
drink
its
not
particularly
sweet
or
thick
or
overly
strawberryy
well
done
so
refreshing
and
crisp
and
nice
and
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
light
and
fruity
it
seems
perfect
for
warmer
weather
as
a
thirst
quencher
and
has
a
unique
flavor
with
the
strawberry
juices
overalldrinkability
this
beer
certainly
is
not
hard
to
drink
and
the
strawberry
flavors
to
kind
of
grow
on
you
though
im
not
sure
its
something
i
would
really
be
searching
for
again
to
be
fair
fruit
wheat
beers
are
low
on
my
beer
todem
pole
but
this
one
is
inoffensive
and
decent
if
you
are
into
the
style
this
may
be
worth
look
for
you
if
point
its
weakness
the
strawberry
at
times
seems
bit
forced
and
strong
but
its
strong
point
is
due
to
light
abv
and
crisp
carbonation
its
decently
refreshing
and
easy
drink
pours
a
lightly
pinkish
tinted
light
brown
mildly
hazy
scent
leads
with
a
nice
whiff
of
fresh
strawberry
but
some
hints
of
sweetness
pop
up
making
me
question
will
the
beer
be
fruity
or
overly
sweet
light
pale
lager
body
some
light
caramel
taste
leads
with
strawberry
in
a
nice
moderate
quantity
fresh
fruit
light
lingering
sweetness
faint
splash
of
caramel
medium
bodied
lightly
fizzy
i
normally
knock
abita
for
their
light
flavored
and
light
bodied
portfolio
of
beers
but
this
one
works
overall
decent
fairly
refreshing
not
cloying
this
poured
out
with
a
light
pinkish
color
to
it
and
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
head
fades
and
just
leaves
a
thin
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
pretty
healthly
aroma
of
strawberry
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
light
the
strawberry
is
sweet
and
just
watered
down
it
seems
the
mouthfeel
is
also
quite
watery
overall
this
beer
wasnt
overly
impressive
just
not
for
me
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
liked
the
strawberry
flavor
of
it
i
heard
a
couple
of
good
things
about
this
so
decided
to
try
when
i
saw
it
available
pours
like
a
pilsner
clear
yellow
body
lots
of
activity
smells
of
strawberry
and
yeast
mixture
the
taste
is
of
unsweetened
macerated
strawberries
its
very
prickly
ad
sodaesque
i
think
abita
should
go
a
little
sweeter
with
this
one
o
its
a
good
beer
but
not
one
you
would
have
all
the
time
a
nice
change
of
pace
once
in
a
while
in
the
summer
time
from
the
ipas
o
overall
i
feel
this
is
a
good
beer
not
great
good
it
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
and
tastes
different
than
many
beers
overall
the
beer
itself
is
very
light
but
the
strawberry
flavour
gets
tiresome
after
a
while
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
the
rest
good
if
you
like
strawberries
there
must
be
some
malt
in
there
because
it
does
have
a
decent
body
but
there
is
not
hop
profile
at
all
as
typical
of
most
fruit
beers
fairly
refreshing
i
would
have
to
say
its
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
o
i
was
expecting
a
disaster
luckily
this
wasnt
too
shabby
o
louisiana
seasonal
staple
delicious
jh
i
almost
never
buy
lagers
because
of
how
light
and
often
tasteless
they
can
be
but
in
this
case
the
flavors
work
and
the
effect
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
almost
like
a
very
dry
cider
the
flavor
is
like
a
beer
version
of
a
strawberry
frozen
fruit
bar
that
you
would
find
in
the
ice
cream
section
of
your
local
grocer
the
immediate
flavor
is
strawberry
some
malt
comes
through
in
the
middle
and
remains
all
the
way
to
the
crisp
finish
but
the
strawberry
makes
a
solid
showing
throughout
the
whole
session
this
is
actually
really
delicious
i
can
never
drink
more
than
one
fruit
beer
but
if
i
had
to
this
would
be
the
one
overall
interesting
beer
strangely
reminds
me
of
something
from
my
childhood
but
cant
quite
place
it
i
would
drink
again
but
more
than
one
would
be
too
much
hard
to
review
because
i
dont
have
much
perspective
on
this
style
or
any
reference
beers
overall
goes
down
fairly
easily
a
great
summer
time
thirst
quencher
recurring
theme
strawberry
and
not
much
else
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
strong
and
only
slightly
sweet
strawberry
overtone
it
pours
a
rather
typical
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
flavor
is
malty
and
has
just
a
bit
of
strawberry
taste
less
than
what
the
aroma
promised
it
is
also
a
bit
watery
texture
is
thick
and
smooth
barely
tingly
ok
but
this
is
not
one
i
will
actively
hunt
out
for
a
second
try
o
drink
well
but
the
smell
was
just
odd
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazed
bright
vibrant
gold
coloring
with
a
thin
layer
of
frothy
head
smooth
creamy
aromas
of
strawberry
that
are
reminiscent
of
strawberry
swirl
ice
cream
beer
leaves
a
great
lacing
along
the
glass
while
you
drink
and
the
beer
has
initial
flavors
of
light
strawberry
syrupy
sweetness
balanced
with
some
toasted
grain
flavors
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
and
it
carries
a
supersweet
aftertaste
that
is
a
light
cream
and
strawberry
combo
the
finish
is
smooth
and
lingering
the
beer
remains
light
despite
the
midrange
body
and
stronger
flavors
good
refresher
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
is
more
like
strawberry
shortcake
than
shorts
strawberry
shortcake
and
a
better
try
at
it
o
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
chilled
as
you
kick
back
in
the
heat
the
strawberries
lend
just
enough
flavor
to
not
trick
you
into
believing
youre
drinking
an
alcoholic
strawberry
soda
this
is
one
of
the
very
select
few
beers
i
have
ever
had
that
could
be
mistaken
for
soda
in
a
way
different
and
not
really
in
a
good
way
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
one
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
a
few
weeks
back
and
split
it
with
my
wife
this
evening
poured
a
light
orange
color
with
a
big
white
head
very
sweet
strawberry
aromas
seemed
to
be
fake
light
bodied
with
lots
of
sweet
strawberry
flavors
kinda
reminded
me
of
strawberry
quik
a
delicious
fruit
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
quick
white
bubbles
with
no
lace
smells
of
trix
cereal
and
strawberry
shortcake
flavor
is
crisp
with
a
sugar
cookie
malt
and
a
tart
hint
of
fruit
on
the
finish
overall
a
solid
quaffer
for
springsummer
overall
not
bad
a
little
different
than
the
fruit
beers
that
ive
had
before
definitely
worth
a
try
o
okay
one
and
done
for
me
hard
to
get
past
the
cloying
sweetness
for
a
lager
its
not
that
refreshing
d
not
too
many
strawberry
beers
out
there
so
this
is
an
interesting
brew
just
for
that
decent
overall
but
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
a
weak
point
the
strawberry
is
strong
but
also
sort
of
odd
it
contributes
to
a
fruity
pepples
crunch
berries
impression
o
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
tastes
of
fruit
without
being
syrupy
and
is
very
clean
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
strawberry
beer
d
easy
drinker
good
for
sipping
on
a
summer
day
clean
and
crisp
taste
slight
sweetness
added
but
nothing
over
powering
good
brew
to
try
but
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
bottle
pours
into
a
tulip
glass
a
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
very
sweet
strawberry
aroma
in
the
nose
almost
too
sweet
and
makes
me
think
they
used
artificial
flavors
strawberry
pez
aroma
mediumlight
mouthfeel
sweet
strawberry
upfront
transitions
to
a
watered
down
berry
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
minimal
lace
overall
this
is
a
fine
summer
beer
but
i
dont
want
to
drink
one
every
day
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
really
could
drink
this
like
water
the
very
subtle
flavors
is
there
and
then
it
is
gone
leaving
no
aftertaste
it
is
very
refreshing
and
quenching
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
perfect
with
the
flavors
the
drinkability
on
this
is
very
good
this
is
very
delicious
and
goes
down
very
easily
overall
a
very
enjoyable
fruit
beer
that
shattered
my
quite
low
expectations
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
snappy
overall
this
is
a
neat
beer
its
definitely
an
original
and
i
think
its
cool
that
its
being
made
into
a
tulip
glass
on
3
25
11
this
pours
a
very
clear
and
bright
yellow
golden
color
with
a
light
film
head
atophas
the
appearance
of
a
pilsner
smell
is
a
moderate
and
pleasant
strawberry
cotton
candy
noted
one
with
a
light
trace
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
light
and
smooth
but
crisp
wash
over
the
palate
that
ends
in
a
somewhat
dry
earthy
strawberry
finish
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
strawberry
fruit
beer
before
and
i
have
to
say
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
thanks
abita
o
like
i
said
above
this
beer
shines
best
as
a
post
summer
yard
work
day
the
hotter
it
is
outside
the
better
this
beer
would
be
tried
this
for
the
first
time
in
nola
when
on
an
incredible
vacation
the
food
was
incredible
the
french
quarter
was
memorable
bourbon
street
was
crazy
the
dominican
cigars
were
fresh
and
enjoyable
the
beer
brings
back
all
of
those
memories
the
strawberry
flavor
is
subtle
and
well
blended
in
a
very
smooth
tasting
very
summer
and
very
exciting
beer
to
look
forward
to
overall
this
is
a
solid
fruit
beer
i
am
no
a
big
fruit
beer
guy
but
after
drinking
a
6
pack
this
will
be
my
go
to
fruit
beer
i
actually
called
pints
o
plenty
in
forrest
va
to
see
if
they
could
get
me
a
keg
not
great
at
all
artificial
flavor
kills
this
glad
i
only
had
one
not
horrific
but
borderline
passable
dm
very
crisp
and
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
beer
for
the
season
drinking
this
beer
in
the
rain
right
now
at
cellar
temperature
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
mouth
not
very
appropriate
but
come
summer
im
going
to
drink
a
case
of
this
while
my
son
mows
the
lawn
sweet
strawberry
smell
reminds
me
of
chewy
candy
artificial
candy
taste
and
body
are
thin
lighter
strawberry
but
still
with
a
strange
creaminess
despite
all
these
things
i
really
like
this
beer
in
the
summer
if
you
like
kissing
people
who
wear
strawberry
lip
gloss
give
this
a
shot
d
not
too
bad
its
nothing
to
geek
out
over
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
light
and
decently
refreshing
supereasy
to
drink
good
malt
definition
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
finish
i
normally
dont
like
fruit
beers
because
theyre
easy
to
screw
up
but
this
one
works
out
pretty
well
pretty
good
beer
overall
not
a
dominatingly
fruity
beer
like
some
others
just
a
beer
mixed
with
a
bit
of
strawberry
flavor
ill
enjoy
this
6pack
but
i
wont
rush
back
for
another
overall
an
easy
drinker
that
the
ladies
should
love
the
only
thing
to
compare
it
to
is
petes
wicked
strawberry
blonde
and
id
say
this
one
is
the
better
of
the
two
12oz
bottle
pours
slightly
cloudy
with
white
head
aroma
of
berries
is
prominent
plus
something
that
reminds
me
of
cotton
candy
taste
is
sweet
and
tart
from
the
berries
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
thinner
bodied
with
and
oily
texture
bitter
finish
that
seems
a
bit
harsh
for
the
softness
of
the
strawberries
not
bad
and
probably
my
favorite
abita
to
date
d
not
a
goto
beer
but
will
finish
6pack
i
will
say
that
this
was
a
letdown
but
i
am
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
im
sure
that
this
may
appeal
to
people
who
hate
beer
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
it
could
always
be
worse
like
a
chelada
ick
d
much
better
than
i
expected
the
strawberry
flavor
is
quite
full
and
convincing
the
underlying
beer
is
nothing
special
but
it
serves
the
purpose
of
providing
a
neutral
platform
for
the
berry
essence
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
sulfuric
off
note
in
the
aroma
but
other
than
that
it
is
clean
and
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
m
bubbly
leaves
smooth
d
overall
effect
even
though
this
is
not
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
is
such
a
hit
in
the
south
for
a
good
low
price
this
is
definitely
one
to
pick
up
when
you
see
it
since
it
is
a
limited
release
i
dont
like
this
very
much
however
i
have
to
give
it
credit
for
originality
and
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
good
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
it
is
light
bodied
and
drinkable
although
the
strawberry
flavor
gets
old
for
me
pretty
quickly
and
i
like
strawberries
kind
of
an
odd
beer
refreshing
but
unusual
definitely
scores
some
points
for
uniqueness
i
typically
really
like
fruit
beers
big
fan
of
abita
purple
haze
thats
why
i
tried
this
one
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
twisted
pine
raspberry
wheat
etc
but
this
one
didnt
do
too
much
for
me
average
d
pretty
good
beer
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
def
appreciate
it
and
it
would
be
a
good
one
to
drink
after
a
workout
to
cool
off
its
ok
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
or
recommend
it
pours
a
very
light
golden
yellow
a
microbubbled
white
ring
forms
smell
is
mainly
one
thing
strawberries
and
gobs
of
them
taste
is
the
exact
thing
just
tons
of
fresh
strawberries
a
wheatie
base
a
bit
of
finishing
hops
hits
at
the
right
spot
let
you
know
this
is
a
beer
feel
is
a
bit
thin
and
finishes
sweet
and
sticky
drinkability
definitely
above
average
if
you
like
strawberries
this
one
is
a
nobrainer
all
in
all
the
after
taste
smell
alone
was
enough
to
conjure
up
good
memories
from
my
childhood
not
something
i
typically
expect
from
a
beer
so
all
in
all
it
isnt
badly
done
and
thankfully
it
isnt
anything
like
a
wine
cooler
or
cloyingly
sweet
the
aroma
strikes
you
as
you
take
a
drink
like
you
stuck
your
nose
in
a
box
of
captain
crunch
this
years
batch
is
extremely
smooth
and
the
flavor
is
the
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
but
again
not
as
sweet
as
previous
years
to
avoid
the
overpowering
of
fullness
its
a
strawberry
lager
and
it
does
that
pretty
well
what
else
is
there
to
expect
d
good
fruit
beer
heck
yeah
right
up
there
by
purple
haze
good
light
beer
definitely
would
prefer
this
over
any
light
lager
any
day
buy
it
again
well
yes
i
would
but
only
if
i
could
find
a
reasonable
price
for
a
six
pack
or
case
as
of
now
a
sixer
is
around
14
dollars
so
its
not
on
to
top
to
drink
again
but
overall
try
it
if
you
can
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
strawberries
with
some
wheat
mixed
in
the
aroma
is
fairly
syrupy
the
flavor
is
strawberry
wheat
and
some
vanilla
the
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
a
strawberry
jolly
rancher
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
a
pretty
good
use
of
fruit
in
a
beer
that
being
said
if
served
very
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
if
rated
against
other
strawberry
beers
this
is
well
above
average
compared
to
other
fruit
beers
its
well
below
average
give
this
is
shot
if
you
love
strawberries
otherwise
you
can
skip
it
d
excellent
hotday
beer
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
good
carbonation
balance
quite
drinkable
refreshing
this
is
pretty
decent
actually
not
something
i
would
usually
try
but
it
works
d
a
nice
brew
for
the
summer
time
every
now
and
then
abita
makes
a
really
decent
beer
this
is
one
of
their
best
im
not
big
on
lagers
generally
im
more
of
a
stout
and
porter
fan
but
i
have
to
say
i
am
really
glad
i
picked
these
up
easily
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beer
i
have
had
this
year
d
this
is
one
of
those
light
crisp
summer
beers
that
drink
like
water
this
would
go
down
so
fast
on
a
hot
summer
day
working
in
the
yard
if
it
was
a
little
more
complex
it
would
be
far
more
enjoyable
d
excellent
summer
beer
could
drink
these
all
night
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
my
favorite
beer
by
far
i
drive
1400
miles
to
get
it
every
year
and
fill
my
little
car
with
all
i
can
fit
in
and
then
i
keep
it
cold
in
my
second
fridge
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
i
dont
like
and
my
friends
love
it
too
i
wish
they
made
it
year
round
and
got
rid
of
the
pecan
ale
which
is
not
very
good
d
easy
to
drink
due
to
low
abv
and
no
real
offensive
tastes
sticking
out
strawberry
beers
are
hard
to
do
and
this
is
not
one
i
care
much
for
nor
would
seek
out
again
d
could
have
an
entire
case
of
these
however
nothing
complex
or
amazing
going
on
here
probably
will
wait
for
next
summer
once
this
pack
is
finished
d
as
fruit
beers
go
this
one
was
decently
drinkable
though
not
the
best
ever
pours
a
slightly
hazy
blond
yellow
fizzy
head
that
settles
at
about
a
half
inch
of
flim
at
the
top
of
the
liquid
there
is
a
brief
faint
hint
of
beer
aroma
but
for
the
most
part
sweet
strawberry
is
all
i
smell
the
taste
is
just
way
to
sweet
and
fruity
for
me
the
few
bitter
beer
flavors
that
come
out
dont
complement
the
strawberry
flavor
i
know
slamming
a
strawberry
beer
for
being
sweet
and
fruity
is
like
reviewing
an
ipa
and
saying
you
dont
like
the
bitterness
its
strawberry
beer
this
is
how
its
supposed
to
taste
and
smell
they
made
it
right
i
just
dont
like
it
that
being
said
i
could
not
drink
it
notes
i
feel
this
is
a
solid
summer
time
beer
but
aside
from
warm
weather
refreshment
i
really
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
its
a
nice
beer
not
really
impressed
but
i
could
find
myself
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
down
here
in
florida
medium
body
with
a
sweet
strawberry
aftertaste
its
wet
in
the
mouth
and
there
is
no
carbonation
on
the
palate
second
taste
kind
of
flat
feeling
not
really
loving
this
beer
good
thing
my
wife
likes
it
mouth
feel
isnt
great
its
a
little
thinner
than
i
like
and
for
something
as
sweet
as
this
is
i
feel
like
a
touch
more
body
would
be
good
still
though
it
is
an
excellent
mouthfeel
for
a
summer
beer
nice
crisp
and
fresh
its
a
little
low
on
the
carbonation
but
its
almost
like
a
bear
soda
you
could
make
a
super
beer
float
with
this
and
some
vanilla
icecream
notes
good
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
last
weekend
in
new
orleans
it
was
a
lot
better
from
what
i
remember
this
merits
the
bc
that
it
gets
d
reading
the
hitormiss
reviews
before
mine
i
fall
squarely
in
the
hit
realm
wow
what
an
easytodrink
treat
a
wellbalanced
berry
fruit
melds
with
a
springy
wheat
ale
it
matches
my
taste
buds
well
ill
admit
the
strawberry
harvest
though
unbeknownst
to
me
as
of
of
a
couple
months
ago
will
now
be
a
springtime
craving
well
done
abita
these
are
a
bugger
to
find
released
early
march
at
the
end
of
april
its
almost
entirely
sold
out
everywhere
in
new
orleans
spoke
with
a
large
store
owner
that
stated
that
he
was
told
by
his
distributor
that
the
lager
didnt
leave
louisiana
this
time
around
i
picked
up
three
six
packs
to
take
home
to
bama
with
me
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
strawberry
flavored
beer
it
almost
tasted
like
a
strawberry
beverage
instead
of
a
beer
but
it
still
tasted
good
i
split
this
bottle
with
my
wifenot
expecting
to
muchand
it
pretty
much
filled
that
bill
poured
a
lighter
golden
color
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
is
gone
pretty
quickly
aromas
have
some
biscuit
mixed
with
strawberrynot
overly
donenot
bad
flavors
seem
to
be
a
little
watery
with
the
mouthfeel
being
quite
thinthe
strawberry
flavors
are
sweetish
and
dont
really
lend
a
big
handsome
mild
toasted
notes
in
the
finish
eh
its
ok
but
not
anything
i
would
have
again
d
this
beer
is
ideal
for
a
break
from
yard
work
or
sitting
on
the
porch
on
a
warm
evening
while
this
beer
would
not
typically
make
it
into
my
fridge
except
for
these
purposes
it
can
certainly
hold
a
temporary
place
on
the
shelf
due
to
its
timely
and
short
lived
span
on
the
seasonal
market
d
two
or
three
when
struggling
with
the
summer
sun
more
than
that
might
destroy
ones
palate
due
to
sweetness
and
tang
this
is
a
regular
pool
beer
for
me
every
summer
i
grab
a
few
sixers
not
a
got
to
have
brew
but
a
nice
summer
refreshment
pours
clear
deep
yellow
with
little
head
retention
or
lacing
smells
a
little
bland
with
pale
malts
and
a
little
strawberry
in
the
back
where
it
should
be
the
flavor
is
good
and
balanced
with
some
sweet
maltiness
and
the
strwberry
is
in
the
back
again
where
it
should
be
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
good
very
easy
drinkin
and
light
i
did
not
like
this
brew
the
apperance
was
average
for
a
normal
lager
the
smell
was
surley
of
strawberries
and
not
a
hint
of
anything
but
malt
the
taste
was
not
very
good
at
all
it
reminded
me
of
how
stinky
feet
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
light
for
my
liking
and
it
does
not
have
a
very
decent
drinability
all
in
all
a
decent
fruit
beer
its
not
typically
a
style
i
really
enjoy
and
certainly
not
a
type
of
fruit
that
i
enjoy
in
beer
with
all
of
that
said
its
probably
quite
a
compliment
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
always
try
to
stock
up
on
this
one
but
it
never
works
out
because
i
always
drink
these
before
anything
else
i
have
in
the
fridge
d
if
you
like
strawberries
and
dont
really
like
beer
i
doubt
you
could
find
a
better
brew
even
with
this
being
said
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
superb
for
nearly
anyone
very
crisp
and
slightly
refreshing
not
bad
but
certainly
not
great
either
due
to
the
low
abv
i
could
put
a
few
down
but
my
palate
is
telling
me
one
is
enough
drinkability
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
this
is
a
wellexecuted
fruit
beer
d
almost
too
drinkable
these
go
down
so
quickly
not
too
sweet
the
flavor
just
keeps
intensifying
the
taste
of
this
beer
changes
from
year
to
year
but
it
is
always
spoton
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
refreshing
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
strawberry
flavoring
not
overwhelming
at
all
in
a
similar
manner
to
abita
purple
haze
abita
has
managed
to
create
a
fruit
beer
with
a
pleasing
hint
of
fruit
flavor
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
with
boiled
crawfish
for
a
springtime
louisiana
treat
not
bad
a
fun
beer
chuggable
on
a
hot
day
not
much
else
very
clean
and
light
tasting
the
gently
malty
beer
finishes
fairly
dry
with
a
bit
of
strawberry
taste
but
practically
no
hops
at
all
all
in
all
a
fairly
average
basic
pale
lager
with
a
little
strawberry
taste
light
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
due
to
the
very
light
taste
taste
ehh
i
had
it
when
i
was
younger
and
liked
it
but
now
its
just
weird
theres
lots
of
wheat
and
a
light
hint
of
strawberry
its
really
odd
skip
it
and
get
their
regular
beers
anyways
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
for
those
who
like
fruit
beers
not
as
sweet
as
a
lambic
but
great
for
what
it
is
at
first
i
was
a
littl
e
reluctant
to
try
fruity
beer
after
opening
the
bottle
the
smell
was
refreshing
i
was
expecting
a
very
fruity
taste
but
no
there
was
a
slight
hint
of
strawberry
which
was
good
for
me
it
went
down
smooth
i
recommend
this
beer
cheers
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
hard
to
drink
i
wouldnt
say
unless
your
the
kind
that
dislikes
sweet
beer
a
good
warm
weather
beer
i
wish
it
was
released
in
march
or
april
and
not
febuary
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
understand
if
somebody
who
doesnt
like
strawberries
or
a
beer
that
is
sweet
if
they
get
sick
of
the
taste
but
i
dont
this
is
a
sip
outside
in
the
sun
beer
at
its
finest
hazy
golden
cast
with
a
filmy
off
white
head
the
fresh
strawberry
smell
doesnt
mask
the
grainy
beer
smell
and
is
actually
quite
nice
and
less
artificial
than
what
i
expected
strawberries
cream
and
barley
make
up
the
flavor
with
faint
herbal
bittering
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
surprisingly
good
beer
for
the
style
i
think
because
it
still
tastes
like
beer
drinkability
this
is
quite
the
novelty
beer
this
is
a
wild
card
amongst
the
world
of
fruit
beer
not
overtly
sweet
toothache
inducing
a
nice
natural
flow
of
strawberries
pretty
well
played
if
your
not
scared
of
drinking
with
your
pinkies
raised
the
carbonation
issue
was
my
biggest
gripe
with
this
beer
until
further
sampling
in
the
future
years
that
is
all
for
now
moreys
bottom
line
not
typically
a
style
that
i
would
go
out
and
purchase
but
for
one
reason
or
another
this
beer
intrigues
me
if
this
brew
wasnt
so
fizzheavy
id
get
a
sixer
every
year
a
pale
light
golden
color
pour
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
little
to
no
lacing
left
aroma
is
kind
of
like
strawberry
cheesecake
with
some
light
grain
hints
flavor
is
pretty
strait
forward
like
a
light
strawberry
wheat
beerlager
some
light
grain
notes
lightly
sweet
not
cloying
or
tart
not
really
any
hop
presence
a
good
clean
mouthfeel
light
body
very
sessionable
this
was
an
enjoyable
try
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
for
myself
pours
a
clear
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
strawberry
and
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
fruit
vegetable
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strawberry
up
front
then
yeast
and
pale
malt
overall
a
very
light
and
refreshing
brew
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
muggy
summer
day
d
this
one
could
be
easily
drinkable
with
how
light
and
fruity
it
is
but
its
just
not
my
style
d
too
much
of
a
novelty
for
much
enjoyment
but
certainly
an
interesting
thing
to
try
once
this
was
a
good
summer
beer
very
refreshing
being
a
strawberry
beer
i
was
glad
to
see
thats
what
it
tasted
like
not
a
plain
beer
with
some
berry
hints
in
it
flavor
is
good
but
not
over
powering
even
my
dad
how
doesnt
really
like
beer
liked
this
if
you
like
sweeter
beers
or
strawberries
you
really
should
try
this
did
i
mention
strawberries
d
for
a
fruit
beer
its
very
tolerable
with
the
thankful
lack
of
abounding
sugar
most
fruit
beers
have
good
summer
brew
decent
beer
if
you
like
strawerry
flavor
i
still
like
sams
cherry
wheat
on
tap
the
fresher
the
better
or
a
good
blueberry
ale
better
d
drinkability
is
just
ok
probably
wont
have
another
others
didnt
seem
to
think
it
was
watery
maybe
its
just
me
drinkability
very
nice
for
a
fruit
beer
the
high
carbonation
makes
this
feel
like
a
strawberry
sparkling
winemoreso
than
beer
this
is
better
than
most
of
abitas
offerings
but
due
to
the
sometimes
intense
sweetness
i
think
the
max
i
could
have
is
two
poured
gold
with
a
small
head
and
smelled
of
strawberry
medium
carbonation
very
light
and
crisp
with
a
slight
malt
taste
mixed
with
a
nice
strawberry
flavor
its
sweet
but
not
a
bad
overpowering
sweetness
and
i
think
the
brew
is
just
the
right
mix
of
fruit
to
give
it
flavor
and
still
be
a
good
beer
this
was
very
tasty
and
refreshing
went
down
easy
almost
too
easy
as
i
drank
2
in
15
minutes
and
is
the
type
of
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
when
its
hot
outside
overall
a
good
summer
beer
edit
right
after
reviewing
this
i
looked
at
this
beer
on
abitas
site
on
there
the
beer
is
a
bright
redgrapefruitflesh
shade
of
amber
this
beer
actually
looks
nothing
like
that
and
itd
look
so
much
better
if
it
did
pours
a
yellow
hazy
straw
color
with
fairly
little
head
i
suppose
for
a
lager
its
fairly
standard
nothing
too
exciting
looking
though
aroma
obviously
has
a
fruity
presence
but
its
not
really
artificial
or
overpowering
if
asked
to
blindlysmell
it
if
that
makes
sense
im
not
even
sure
id
know
the
fruit
was
strawberry
this
is
an
attribute
of
the
flavor
as
well
it
taste
like
strawberry
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
strawberry
flavoring
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
strawberry
lollipop
or
such
a
strong
wheat
presence
is
also
detectable
the
mouth
and
drinkibility
are
where
the
beer
really
shines
if
you
are
looking
for
something
sessionable
particularly
on
a
hot
day
the
lightbody
is
crisp
with
good
carbonation
and
it
doesnt
weigh
you
down
at
all
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
head
no
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
strawberries
and
a
bit
of
lemon
taste
is
of
malt
and
strawberry
just
a
slight
bitterness
from
the
hop
character
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
and
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
good
summer
beer
this
is
almost
like
a
dessert
beer
just
because
its
so
sweet
its
also
somewhat
refreshing
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
hot
afternoon
or
evening
d
one
will
do
any
more
and
it
get
to
be
overwheliming
d
due
to
the
sweetness
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
but
this
is
well
done
beer
abita
has
left
me
underwhelmed
with
other
offerings
but
definitely
not
this
one
the
pour
is
pretty
i
will
give
it
that
nice
head
soem
lacing
but
thats
all
that
good
about
this
beer
it
smells
and
tastes
like
you
squeezed
a
pound
of
strawberries
into
a
glass
of
simple
syrup
cloyingly
sweet
no
depth
no
nuances
horrible
beer
avoid
it
like
the
plague
in
general
i
do
not
enjoy
the
fruit
and
beer
combination
and
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
fruity
concoction
i
was
able
to
finish
it
giving
it
some
credit
this
isnt
my
favourite
abita
but
its
near
the
top
of
the
list
i
certainly
wouldnt
decline
if
it
were
free
however
ive
had
better
fruit
beers
very
foamy
three
finger
plus
head
as
you
pour
settles
down
to
one
finger
of
bone
white
micro
bubbles
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
moderate
depth
to
the
yelloworange
color
retains
its
transparency
hue
intensity
drops
off
a
lot
at
the
rims
pure
strawberry
filled
nose
no
doubt
about
that
ripe
and
even
laced
with
powdered
sugar
maybe
some
golden
honey
as
well
cant
find
much
past
those
strawberries
lightbodied
here
the
grain
hops
and
mild
bitters
create
a
semblance
of
balance
the
sour
lemon
pitches
in
too
then
its
back
to
the
strawberries
even
with
less
power
than
in
the
nose
tends
to
cling
to
the
tongue
rather
than
lift
even
at
its
relatively
lighter
weight
easy
sipper
not
overly
sweet
almost
like
an
alcoholic
strawberry
soda
or
juice
or
something
ok
beer
in
the
heat
yet
as
my
palate
develops
i
find
i
like
more
richer
tasting
beers
even
when
its
hot
and
i
live
in
dallas
drinkability
was
fine
not
really
hurt
by
the
strawberry
as
the
beer
is
certainly
not
overly
sweet
that
said
not
one
id
reach
for
under
just
any
circumstance
i
really
didnt
expect
to
think
much
of
this
beer
but
i
recently
bought
a
second
sixer
i
think
it
will
definitely
be
a
summer
favorite
if
you
swish
it
around
in
your
mouth
the
extra
fizz
almost
makes
it
taste
like
you
are
eating
strawberry
poprocks
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
great
aromas
strawberry
sweet
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
floral
hop
very
nice
strawberry
and
malt
flavors
blend
nicely
the
higher
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
creamy
quality
which
of
course
goes
nicely
with
the
strawberry
flavors
there
is
a
little
hop
bitterness
and
tartness
in
the
finish
all
in
all
a
very
well
balanced
beer
only
maybe
a
little
bit
on
the
sweet
side
can
only
have
one
or
two
due
to
that
d
i
prefer
fruit
beers
to
be
understated
with
fruit
flavors
complementing
rather
than
overpowering
the
nature
of
the
brew
while
the
lager
base
here
is
pretty
average
they
avoid
overdoing
the
strawberry
flavor
and
it
never
comes
across
as
artificial
which
is
nice
a
light
refreshing
fruity
beer
a
good
over
all
beer
for
fruity
beer
lovers
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
an
average
sized
heada
very
clear
beer
smells
quite
a
bit
like
strawberry
yogurt
this
is
actually
a
very
pleasant
smell
and
it
is
much
better
than
i
remembered
it
in
the
past
the
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
like
the
smell
nothing
unpleasant
but
nothing
sets
this
beer
apart
its
strawberries
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
so
dont
expect
to
anything
fancy
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
for
this
beer
unlike
many
abitas
however
it
still
feels
a
bit
thin
the
drinkability
is
good
but
the
sweetness
gets
annoying
after
a
while
if
you
can
put
up
with
it
then
it
would
be
easy
to
sip
on
a
six
pack
throughout
the
night
d
this
is
a
pretty
damn
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
a
perfect
summer
outdoors
beer
recommended
overall
a
good
bier
that
was
a
welcome
find
at
my
local
bier
store
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
in
search
of
a
refreshing
fruity
bier
prosit
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
very
fast
slim
white
head
really
carbonated
stayed
bubbly
the
entire
time
smells
very
faintly
of
strawberries
and
really
nothing
else
it
could
just
be
me
but
the
taste
was
not
there
it
had
a
slight
hint
of
strawberry
but
other
than
that
i
felt
like
it
tasted
pretty
much
like
nothing
just
sort
of
like
drinking
carbonated
water
because
of
the
taste
the
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
if
that
is
what
one
is
going
for
the
fruit
in
the
beer
isnt
overpowering
in
the
least
and
it
goes
down
really
easily
not
really
all
that
impressed
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
strawberry
for
sure
this
one
is
i
like
sweet
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
just
too
much
for
my
tastes
not
enough
malt
in
the
wort
boil
i
think
to
accomadate
the
fruit
this
is
even
to
sweet
to
drink
2
in
a
row
a
good
beer
perhaps
for
a
fun
loving
lady
of
the
evening
verdict
in
all
honesty
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
it
reminds
of
me
of
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
in
a
way
its
a
fruit
dominated
beer
that
just
seems
wrong
but
you
cant
help
but
like
of
course
this
is
miles
ahead
of
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
was
gone
in
a
flash
no
lacing
fruity
aroma
strawberry
is
there
but
not
overpowering
maybe
just
a
hint
of
caramel
and
sugary
sweetness
but
doesnt
smell
bad
at
all
taste
is
a
nice
dose
of
strawberries
sweet
pale
malts
a
hint
of
bitterness
nice
and
crisp
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
do
actually
like
this
one
and
think
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
refreshing
and
not
cloyingly
sweet
or
fruity
thanks
to
deepsouth
for
the
extra
overal
a
very
nice
fruity
beer
perfect
for
the
summertime
wow
nectar
of
the
gods
strawberry
flavor
is
subtle
yet
omnipresent
with
a
nice
dose
of
light
malt
graininess
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
there
was
some
wheat
in
here
as
well
as
i
get
a
bit
of
tartness
near
the
end
this
is
one
helluva
refreshing
beer
its
delicate
so
drink
it
before
any
palate
wreckers
great
job
abita
d
decent
choice
for
a
beer
great
choice
for
a
fruity
lager
paired
with
a
peanut
butter
and
strawberry
jelly
sandwich
for
a
lager
i
love
it
strawberry
harvest
may
not
pair
impeccably
well
with
crawfish
but
with
a
relaxing
saturday
of
friends
grilling
and
a
washer
tournament
count
me
in
buy
this
now
before
it
sells
out
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
is
one
that
i
would
drink
a
couple
of
on
a
hot
day
very
good
example
of
a
fruit
lager
12
oz
bottle
from
frugal
macdoogals
in
nashville
poured
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
aroma
of
strawberries
and
some
malt
flavor
is
strawberries
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
makes
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
or
a
good
beer
to
keep
around
for
the
ladies
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
so
drinkability
is
definitely
up
there
when
the
temperature
outside
is
right
taste
imparted
by
the
strawberries
is
not
overdone
and
it
does
seem
quite
fresh
unlike
some
artificial
tasting
fruit
beers
overall
one
of
the
few
abita
offerings
that
might
be
worth
picking
up
drinkability
my
first
bottle
was
paired
with
a
spicy
cajun
salmon
the
cajun
spice
pairs
wonderfully
wonderfully
with
the
strawberry
lager
we
bought
the
other
3
cases
we
host
a
crawfish
boil
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
brew
with
the
crustaceans
looking
forward
to
enjoying
one
on
the
lawmower
tomorrow
the
color
is
a
clear
pale
amber
it
pours
a
big
thick
head
that
leaves
excellent
spotty
lacing
carbonation
is
lively
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
all
strawberries
without
the
medicinal
tint
of
fake
fruits
or
sweeteners
it
actually
smells
a
lot
like
fresh
strawberries
followed
with
a
light
hops
citrus
finish
on
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
smell
accurately
with
perhaps
slightly
more
of
a
subtle
hops
pine
in
a
light
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
this
one
is
not
at
all
thick
with
active
carbonation
if
its
a
bit
light
on
taste
and
mouthfeel
at
least
one
can
tell
its
all
real
no
adjuncts
or
cereal
grains
just
real
strawberry
and
though
seemingly
in
fairly
low
volume
real
hops
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
with
low
berry
taste
bud
drinkers
would
highly
approve
not
a
great
beer
advocate
beer
though
i
could
not
drink
multiples
just
wanted
to
try
it
d
4
a
very
nice
fresh
strawberry
fruit
beer
its
great
to
know
abita
uses
fresh
la
strawberries
and
it
comes
through
in
the
seasonal
release
it
was
a
pleasure
to
try
this
brew
in
the
fine
town
of
nawlins
with
fine
food
at
jacquesimos
its
worth
a
try
if
you
are
open
to
fruit
beers
overall
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
ive
never
had
a
strawberry
beer
before
abitas
done
a
fine
job
with
this
lager
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoy
it
very
much
we
can
not
wait
to
go
to
the
abita
brewery
and
try
this
beer
on
tap
light
and
refreshing
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
straw
color
in
to
my
pint
glass
the
white
bubbly
head
settled
quickly
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
on
top
aroma
is
very
grainy
with
a
candylike
strawberry
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
most
of
the
beeryness
hidden
behind
the
strawberry
the
beer
was
a
little
bit
too
flat
for
my
liking
but
it
did
have
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
it
went
down
easy
and
would
make
for
a
good
lawnmower
beer
d
light
beer
strong
strawberry
the
flavor
is
too
intense
to
taste
natural
but
it
is
enjoyable
atmosphere
may
be
more
pronounced
than
taste
the
wheat
overwhelms
a
bit
and
has
a
watereddown
taste
and
the
nose
just
doesnt
seem
to
sync
up
with
the
flavor
however
decent
quaff
overall
the
body
is
light
and
a
bit
wispy
carbonation
is
low
but
ok
overall
sure
strawberries
are
hard
to
do
but
there
are
some
other
off
notes
in
this
beer
that
just
create
an
off
experience
d
this
beer
rates
very
high
with
me
the
natural
strawberry
flavors
mend
well
with
the
lager
style
in
my
opinion
this
a
very
sessionable
beer
not
my
style
so
it
was
worth
having
once
notes
from
72508
the
aroma
has
a
light
lager
smell
with
light
but
real
strawberries
the
appearance
is
yellow
with
a
thin
head
the
flavor
is
quite
refreshing
and
fruity
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
ok
but
lacks
anything
special
that
would
make
me
want
another
i
had
this
with
some
spicy
jumbalaya
and
the
spice
played
well
with
the
sweetness
if
fruit
beer
is
your
thing
i
highly
recomend
this
one
it
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
on
a
warm
day
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
better
than
most
abita
offerings
imo
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
pretty
watery
overall
light
on
the
palate
but
that
is
to
be
expected
after
drinking
real
fruit
beers
such
as
founders
rubeas
this
pales
in
comparison
and
the
color
shows
it
haha
carbonation
is
actually
pretty
low
wouldve
expected
it
to
be
higherto
be
something
more
like
a
wine
cooler
but
alas
no
and
thank
god
its
not
higher
that
would
totally
bastardize
this
beer
real
easy
drinker
i
can
almost
chug
this
beer
i
mean
that
totally
signifies
that
it
is
a
poor
brew
anything
respectable
should
hold
its
own
and
not
be
able
to
be
chugged
this
is
one
you
could
drink
all
night
but
why
unless
you
are
trying
to
get
your
significant
other
wasted
and
even
then
itll
prolly
take
more
than
a
sixer
the
new
version
is
very
sessionable
easy
to
put
back
plenty
of
these
and
goes
great
with
boiled
crawfish
all
and
all
not
a
bad
brew
not
my
favorite
but
strawberries
are
hard
to
work
with
probably
my
favorite
from
abita
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
pale
golden
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
head
did
leave
a
very
small
layer
the
entire
beer
aroma
reminded
me
of
strawberry
shortcake
but
more
strongly
of
strawberry
syrup
from
strawberry
ice
cream
topping
taste
had
hints
of
strawberry
but
was
mostly
bland
possibly
white
breadish
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
and
watery
with
heavy
carbonation
levels
the
bubbles
tingled
all
over
the
entire
mouth
easy
to
drink
but
the
carbonation
detracted
and
turned
it
into
a
summer
sipper
poured
this
one
halfway
into
a
glass
and
had
the
rest
out
of
the
bottle
pours
a
light
golden
color
very
little
head
retention
it
fizzled
after
about
a
minute
like
soda
has
a
strawberry
candy
smell
like
a
box
of
strawberry
nerds
very
light
on
the
palate
with
a
hint
of
caramel
just
before
the
aftertaste
strawberries
come
full
force
in
the
aftertase
no
complexity
at
all
but
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
definitely
had
more
taste
in
the
bottle
than
out
a
decent
fruit
beer
not
unlike
abitas
purple
haze
pours
a
very
nice
hazy
golden
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
white
head
with
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
nice
touch
of
strawberries
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
some
strawberries
and
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
a
very
nice
thrist
quencher
not
much
head
at
all
and
pours
a
very
golden
color
the
smell
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
with
a
subtle
aroma
of
strawberries
the
taste
is
mild
and
doesnt
offer
much
bite
and
the
strawberry
taste
is
minimal
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
easy
to
put
down
a
few
but
overall
not
great
either
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
color
with
a
short
lived
smallish
white
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
strawberry
candy
and
a
bit
strange
taste
is
like
strawberry
cereal
and
reminds
me
of
the
milk
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
medium
bodied
with
normal
carbonation
hint
of
odd
sourness
not
that
great
tasted
on
6908
single
bottle
purchased
from
whole
foods
poured
into
a
sabl
glass
pours
a
crisp
bubbly
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
frothy
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
ring
aroma
is
sweet
fruits
and
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
strawberry
the
taste
had
a
bit
more
of
a
strawberry
kick
maybe
too
much
as
it
seems
to
overthrow
any
beer
tastes
the
beer
is
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
but
possesses
a
slight
bit
of
unexpected
syruppiness
this
one
is
certainly
not
one
ill
be
drinking
again
the
abita
harvest
strawberry
lager
pours
light
golden
with
minimal
head
it
is
crystal
clear
balienced
lager
with
the
sent
of
strawberries
there
is
mild
a
carbonation
and
a
gradual
building
of
strawberry
flavor
that
is
subtle
and
ballenced
yet
not
overwhelming
the
malt
profile
is
light
slightly
sweet
but
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finnish
this
beer
is
nice
light
with
nothing
much
to
think
about
an
interesting
beer
glad
i
tried
it
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
but
it
would
be
fun
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
the
strawberry
flavor
is
great
and
refreshing
so
it
is
a
great
summer
brew
d
i
wish
i
couldve
drank
a
case
of
this
in
the
weekend
i
was
in
new
orleans
for
im
dying
to
drink
this
again
its
that
great
d
not
bad
would
not
go
crazy
looking
for
it
but
it
hit
the
spot
for
me
on
this
very
warm
day
in
june
pours
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
and
leaving
some
lace
clear
pale
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied

flavor
is
strawberry
but
is

bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
but
persistent
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
fruity
definitely
strawberry
with
a
mild
grain
aroma
the
flavor
is
moderately
malty
a
bit
grainy
and
a
bit
sweet
the
beer
finishes
crisp

with
a
nice
reserved
strawberry
flavor
the
body

overall
a
very
refreshing
wellmade
beer
recommend
i
enjoyed
this
with
lunch
today
at
the
sterling
sun
singer
a
finger
of
white
froth
tops
a
lighttomedium
golden
body
nice
lacing
rings
the
pint
glass
moderate
fruit
aroma
on
the
nose
but
i
expected
a
bit
stronger
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
without
being
cloying
delicious
if
a
bit
understated
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
strawberry
shortcake
this
would
be
even
better
with
a
fuller
complement
of
malt
to
round
out
the
nice
strawberry
flavor
the
lack
of
complexity
leaves
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
yet
this
is
a
delicious
enjoyable
beer
very
refreshing
and
nicely
fruited
without
being
overly
sweet
the
finish
balances
sweet
with
a
light
tart
flavor
good
beer
d
this
is
just
about
the
best
nonlambic
fruit
beer
out
there
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
plain
old
goodness
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
look
forward
to
trying
each
year
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
would
go
over
pretty
good
with
those
new
into
craft
beer
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
lots
of
sourness
particularly
in
the
swallow
and
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
this
is
an
odd
flavored
beer
not
my
style
pours
a
very
lightly
hazey
straw
with
a
touch
og
light
amber
added
to
the
color
a
thick
ring
of
foam
settles
afte
the
with
two
bubble
columns
rising
to
the
top
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
this
particular
strawberries
and
cream
gummy
candy
i
used
to
have
when
i
was
younger
i
cant
remember
the
name
of
the
candy
though
the
flavor
carries
on
the
strawberry
and
cream
smell
with
some
very
faint
herbal
hops
jumping
around
in
the
background
the
palate
maintatins
a
slow
recession
of
the
strawberry
fruit
flavors
but
its
light
maybe
a
little
syrpy
but
still
fantastic
on
the
palate
great
for
the
summer
relaxing
refreshing
flavorful
and
unique
md
its
light
bodied
with
a
substantial
amount
of
carbonation
too
much
in
my
opinion
that
bittersmellows
out
some
of
the
sweeter
flavors
that
need
more
prominent
exposure
the
beer
has
a
relatively
long
finish
yet
is
somewhat
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
diminishes
from
the
flavor
and
experience
to
such
an
extent
that
im
docking
the
drinkability
score
while
this
is
a
semirefreshing
fruit
beer
that
isnt
too
over
the
top
the
flavor
isnt
sufficient
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
served
in
a
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
weak
i
can
notice
some
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
strawberries
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
however
it
just
tastes
like
they
took
a
macro
lager
and
put
some
strawberry
flavor
in
it
i
dont
know
if
abita
uses
corn
in
their
beers
at
all
but
to
me
it
tastes
like
corngrain
sweet
malt
and
some
strawberries
good
thing
i
like
strawberries
theres
a
lingering
strawberry
aftertaste
thats
more
like
dried
strawberries
than
fresh
ones
which
is
nice
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
a
bit
watery
with
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
not
hard
to
drink
with
all
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
point
to
seek
this
beer
out
its
not
bad
but
theres
just
too
many
better
choices
out
there
drinkability
if
you
dig
lagers
and
sweet
strawberries
then
you
could
definitely
go
for
this
for
me
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
this
is
nothing
special
or
spectacular
in
any
way
but
it
would
be
decent
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
when
you
dont
want
something
too
heavy
it
has
a
very
light
body
and
anequally
light
taste
both
the
lager
and
strawberry
taste
are
very
mild
the
berries
smell
much
stronger
than
the
actual
taste
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
light
straw
forming
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
quickly
light
spots
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
bmc
lager
with
strawberry
added
in
thank
god
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
the
only
way
that
i
can
describe
the
taste
is
captain
crunchs
berry
crunch
cereal
just
like
i
remember
as
a
kid
not
bad
in
my
opinion
light
mouthfeel
light
mouthfeel
and
good
flavor
could
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
dont
know
of
anyone
who
would
have
a
second
in
one
night
overall
not
a
bad
fruit
flavored
beer
i
know
alot
of
serious
beer
drinkers
wont
approve
of
this
but
then
again
i
think
its
the
right
beer
to
start
a
nonbeer
drinker
on
the
right
path
worth
a
try
i
could
see
pairing
this
interestingly
to
a
desert
or
meat
option
with
some
success
our
tasters
thought
the
strong
strawberry
nose
and
the
surprisingly
unsweet
taste
were
the
strongest
points
of
the
beer
but
it
still
lacked
the
body
and
complexity
of
a
truly
great
strawberry
wheat
still
on
the
whole
it
was
a
good
fruit
beer
that
even
those
of
us
who
dislike
such
beers
could
enjoy
if
you
like
strawberries
and
want
candylike
beer
go
for
this
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
fact
i
would
recommend
this
not
only
to
fans
of
fruit
beers
or
light
lagers
but
also
for
people
who
are
not
big
beer
drinkers
that
may
like
a
sweeter
beverage
this
is
definitely
not
for
people
who
dont
like
strawberries
d
this
would
be
an
ideal
beer
on
a
hot
humid
louisiana
afternoon
i
wouldnt
put
it
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
fruit
beers
but
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
strawberry
harvest
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
have
to
admit
being
a
bit
charmed
by
it
its
certainly
more
interesting
than
your
normal
macro
lager
if
you
like
pseudostrawberry
flavor
then
this
may
be
your
kind
of
thing
worth
a
6
pack
a
year
purchase
in
my
book
perfectly
clear
light
yellow
with
a
sparkling
head
that
settled
down
fast
smells
of
strawberry
yougurt
a
fairly
strong
strawberry
taste
with
a
clean
dry
finish
an
american
lager
with
fruit
and
no
adjunct
offtaste
good
a
crisp
bubbly
lager
that
is
a
summer
quaffer
i
could
drink
this
for
a
while
however
the
strawberry
is
a
little
bit
much
for
me
and
i
may
get
sick
of
it
after
several
of
these
recommended
this
isnt
a
complex
beer
and
certainly
not
a
great
beer
but
a
simple
lager
with
nice
strawberry
undertones
its
nice
to
have
a
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
whats
supposedly
in
it
d
drinkability
was
decent
for
what
it
is
you
cant
fault
a
beer
by
its
style
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
drinking
strawberry
wheat
beers
ive
experienced
with
a
nice
balance
fruity
but
respectably
well
brewed
and
clean
props
again
to
jason
one
of
the
easiest
trades
ive
had
the
opportunity
of
doing
a
very
strawberry
beer
and
it
really
tastes
like
strawberry
not
all
syrupy
d
again
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
no
noticeable
alcohol
and
the
crispness
was
refreshing
and
not
much
cloying
this
will
be
a
good
summer
beer
a
fruit
beer
i
can
actually
look
forward
to
more
of
this
lager
is
brewed
for
the
ponchatoula
strawberry
festival
that
is
heald
every
year
in
april
the
color
is
light
golden
color
reminded
me
of
the
abita
golden
but
with
a
slight
strawberry
hue
i
hope
that
this
beer
is
made
with
real
louisiana
strawberries
i
assume
it
is
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
had
two
whilst
walking
amongst
the
crowds
at
the
festival
it
did
however
have
a
slightly
off
taste
it
reminded
me
of
the
taste
in
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
drinkability
nothing
complex
at
all
about
this
beer
i
usually
limit
myself
to
one
or
two
a
season
a
sunday
breakfast
brew
in
the
springtime
that
would
make
a
great
paring
with
some
pecan
pancakes
not
a
big
fan
but
is
nice
for
a
yearly
sample
d
it
lacked
much
flavor
at
all
it
wasnt
a
great
brew
but
far
better
than
their
purple
haze
bottle
pours
a
clear
yellow
body
with
an
average
sized
white
head
some
patchy
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
is
cooked
strawberries
and
sweetish
malts
light
medium
body
is
crisply
carbonated
taste
is
dominated
by
an
upfront
strawberry
fruitiness
that
to
its
credit
is
not
at
all
artificial
some
clean
lager
traits
hover
underneath
but
hop
presence
is
very
fleeting
quite
well
done
for
what
it
is
pleasantly
drinkable
for
a
fruit
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
doubt
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
some
more
nice
beer
this
one
surprised
me
quite
a
bit
very
fresh
real
strawberry
flavour
and
smell
the
smell
is
delicous
sweet
and
refreshing
with
a
light
mellowness
if
you
enjoy
fruit
beers
this
one
is
very
drinkable
about
as
funny
as
sinbad
not
the
actor
but
the
sailor
d
definately
drinks
smooth
and
chrisp
would
enjoy
this
as
an
alternative
to
sweeter
lambics
overall
unimpressed
i
tried
this
beer
because
i
liked
the
abita
purple
haze
but
was
completely
let
down
the
smell
was
unpleasant
and
hard
to
place
and
the
taste
was
decent
at
best
if
you
see
this
one
out
there
keep
on
walking
what
the
heck
i
have
another
bottle
so
i
may
as
well
revisit
this
to
see
if
my
mind
has
changed
nope
not
really
it
is
plenty
sweet
though
so
be
aware
of
that
part
about
it
pours
a
slightly
clouded
gold
nose
is
a
touch
of
strawberries
over
a
firm
metallic
character
flavor
is
kind
of
like
a
smooth
lager
with
a
creamy
strawberry
presence
that
is
just
slight
what
ruins
it
for
me
is
the
somewhat
harsh
aftertaste
of
metal
just
too
much
metallic
for
my
liking
feel
is
thick
with
carbonation
and
fairly
standard
on
the
liquid
overall
it
is
drinkable
yes
just
not
so
much
since
there
is
a
lack
of
firm
strawberry
and
also
with
the
presence
of
so
much
metallic
drinkability
nicely
refreshing
and
mildly
pleasant
the
strawberries
are
not
fake
tasting
which
is
a
big
plus
here
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
you
would
drink
all
day
this
is
a
decent
fruit
beer
the
strawberry
is
not
quite
as
artificial
as
is
found
in
so
many
of
this
style
its
rather
weak
but
maintains
a
beer
quality
albeit
light
rated
per
style
better
than
other
fruit
beers
but
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
other
than
being
rather
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
it
is
very
easy
to
knock
off
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
night
the
novelty
of
the
strawberry
flavor
fades
off
and
one
begins
to
crave
other
more
traditional
styles
which
is
perfect
as
it
is
a
seasonal
offering
although
production
doubled
this
year
over
last
and
i
am
still
able
to
find
this
spring
seasonal
on
the
shelves
in
midseptember
as
a
fruit
beer
it
is
an
excellent
representative
of
the
style
i
favor
it
over
petes
strawberry
blonde
i
had
just
walked
from
the
audobon
zoo
to
a
place
in
the
french
quater
on
a
94
degree
90
percent
humidity
august
day
in
new
orleans
thats
about
six
and
a
half
miles
needless
to
say
i
was
thirsty
i
like
to
drink
local
so
when
im
in
new
orleans
i
drink
a
lot
of
abita
and
dixie
although
i
think
that
dixie
is
being
contract
brewed
since
katrina
anyway
the
bartender
told
me
to
give
this
one
a
try
and
it
was
just
right
the
appearence
of
the
beer
was
nothing
terribly
special
just
a
nice
golden
color
with
only
a
little
head
aroma
is
real
nice
a
very
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
aroma
of
fresh
strawberries
the
taste
wasnt
awe
inspiring
but
it
sure
did
hit
the
spot
basically
i
would
say
that
its
a
very
clean
crisp
drinkable
beer
and
the
strawberries
come
through
perfectly
in
the
finish
for
a
fruit
beer
this
beer
isnt
fruity
it
is
very
nicely
balanced
and
very
refreshing
in
terms
of
drinkablilty
this
one
gets
high
marks
from
me
i
had
four
of
them
without
even
thinking
about
it
this
is
truly
an
excellent
beer
to
drink
ice
cold
on
a
steamy
day
drinkability
ok
i
found
this
beer
to
be
actually
good
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
nice
hot
humid
louisiana
day
right
after
maybe
doing
yardwork
or
something
all
i
know
is
this
beer
rolls
at
work
when
we
get
it
in
we
sell
it
by
the
case
and
we
sell
everything
priced
by
the
bottle
people
love
this
beer
and
i
have
to
agree
with
them
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
will
i
have
more
mouthfeeldrinkability
with
a
smooth
yet
prickly
entry
this
beer
softly
foams
and
goes
down
extremely
well
for
the
style
this
ranks
near
the
top
of
my
list
for
fruit
beers
its
light
easy
in
the
mouth
and
has
a
more
subdued
flavor
than
magic
hat
9
for
example
i
finished
this
beer
with
gratitude
to
have
tried
it
overall
i
was
very
suprised
i
really
did
enjoy
this
it
was
very
unique
and
not
overpowering
like
it
could
have
been
overall
just
a
really
great
summer
brew
i
will
definatly
purchase
again
aroma
of
strawberries
is
evident
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
top
not
too
much
head
and
it
dissipates
pretty
quickly
crisp
and
light
with
thin
mouthfeel
tastes
a
bit
like
strawberry
soda
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
prefer
abita
purple
haze
for
fruit
beers
i
was
pleased
with
pretty
much
everything
in
this
beer
except
the
mouthfeel
it
was
a
bit
too
thin
and
wimpy
for
me
id
like
something
a
little
more
coating
and
lasting
on
the
tongue
the
smell
was
very
nice
something
like
those
little
strawberry
candies
that
your
granny
had
in
a
bowl
the
taste
was
similar
but
also
creamy
which
made
it
unique
all
in
all
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
especially
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
if
youre
into
strawberries
this
is
as
sessionable
a
fruit
beer
as
youll
find
it
has
a
light
body
and
toned
down
fruit
influence
making
easy
to
enjoy
several
not
a
bad
beer
a
refreshing
treat
for
a
hot
afternoon
95
here
today
the
beer
is
a
very
light
orange
with
little
head
the
strawberries
are
strong
in
the
smell
as
well
as
taste
the
beer
does
not
have
any
strong
harsh
tastes
that
detract
smooth
all
around
easy
drinking
and
at
less
than
7
a
sixer
i
will
likely
buy
a
couple
more
for
the
hot
weather
predicted
here
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
sweet
strawberry
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
light
malt
flavor
that
is
overwhelmed
by
a
sweet
strawberry
taste
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
adequate
carbaonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
not
that
complex
or
even
well
brewed
cheap
strawberry
essence
but
it
hits
the
spot
unless
things
change
go
with
petes
strawberry
blonde
it
is
not
as
good
as
last
years
strawberry
harvest
but
it
is
way
better
than
this
years
the
flavor
is
a
sweet
and
subtle
strawberry
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
refreshing
drinker
on
a
hot
day
im
willing
to
bet
that
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
pass
as
a
session
beer
also
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
which
could
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
your
tastes
the
strawberry
flavor
is
everpresent
but
dont
assume
that
its
going
to
make
you
forget
youre
drinking
beer
this
is
a
fine
fruit
beer
to
try
on
a
hot
summer
day
even
if
youre
not
usually
a
fan
of
such
selections
overall
its
a
nice
strawberry
flavor
on
an
average
to
disappointing
beer
canvas
its
very
pleasant
to
me
as
a
strawberry
lover
but
not
the
best
strawberry
beer
by
far
being
a
fan
of
other
abita
offerings
i
thought
id
give
this
a
shot
im
glad
i
did
i
find
it
to
be
very
refreshing
i
buy
this
everytime
my
local
beer
store
carries
it
it
certainly
isnt
for
everyone
if
you
dont
like
fruit
beers
certainly
avoid
this
one
because
it
is
strong
on
the
strawberry
flavor
if
you
fancy
fruit
beers
and
would
like
to
try
something
that
would
go
down
so
smooth
on
a
warm
summer
evening
then
this
is
indeed
your
beer
i
currently
have
some
in
the
fridge
which
i
cant
wait
to
get
home
to
i
drank
it
last
night
and
it
was
wonderful
pours
a
mildly
hazed
pale
brass
with
many
bubbles
present
and
a
frothy
white
head
that
holds
up
well
and
leaves
streaks
of
lace
after
each
sip
has
a
very
sweet
nose
of
strawberry
and
cotton
candy
with
lots
of
graininess
and
some
odd
white
wine
aromas
as
well
flavor
is
a
medley
of
pale
malts
toasted
malts
subtle
strawberries
cotton
candy
and
some
pleasant
supporting
grain
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
but
doesnt
stick
the
tongue
too
hard
body
is
light
this
is
one
refreshing
and
tasty
fruit
beer
and
a
great
one
from
abita
i
really
think
this
might
be
abitas
best
offering
and
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
the
base
style
is
a
great
pick
for
the
fruit
and
it
scores
big
points
with
me
for
not
being
wheat
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
fruit
apparent
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
healthy
strawberry
undertone
the
mouthfeel
is
full
this
is
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
those
who
enjoy
fruit
flavored
brews
overall
this
ones
yet
another
fruit
beer
that
i
am
surprised
that
i
enjoyed
it
would
be
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
but
its
refreshing
enough
that
its
worth
revisiting
for
a
pint
every
so
often
body
is
above
light
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
average
drinkability
decent
and
drinkable
but
modest
and
underwhelming
ill
probably
get
another

just
to
keep
it
around
seeing
as
this
is
a
seasonal
no
regrets
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
so
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
and
surely
wouldnt
make
it
a
session
but
i
could
see
some
people
being
fans
of
this
especially
for
a
light
summer
brew
which
its
certainly
come
around
for
despite
all
the
current
rain
were
having
in
richmond
despite
its
shortcomings
strawberry
harvest
lager
is
an
okay
little
fruit
beer
as
long
as
ones
expectations
arent
skyhigh
more
bursting
berry
goodness
would
probably
make
it
one
of
abitas
best
taste
is
pleasant
with
a
distinct
strawberry
note
tucked
away
behind
the
watery
wheat
body
some
banana
vanilla
and
raspberry
as
well
very
nicely
done
especially
when
combined
with
the
mouthfeel
its
crisp
and
light
on
the
tongue
while
a
great
carbonation
level
gives
it
a
clean
finish
overall
its
fairly
tasty
perhaps
rivaling
abitas
purple
haze
in
flavor
and
drinkability
shared
with
a
friend
thanks
tyler
at
rfd
washington
this
is
a
bit
hazy
and
relatively
flat
unfortunately
the
overall
impression
of
this
brew
by
everyone
involved
was
best
encapsulated
by
tyler
who
is
a
big
purple
haze
fan
who
described
it
as
kids
toothpaste
in
a
glass
only
for
the
fruit
lovers

overall
impression
not
bad
certainly
better
than
some
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
it
has
been
a
while
but
this
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
petes
strawberry
blonde
this
was
an
interesting
beer
to
try
though
i
would
be
reluctant
to
ever
order
it
the
flavor
was
basically
of
dehydrated
strawberries
as
one
would
be
familar
w
in
captain
crunch
ceral
though
not
having
had
any
other
fruit
style
beers
it
is
hard
to
be
fair
in
judging
this
beer
entirely
i
think
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beverage
cheers
to
abita
and
cheers
to
bross
never
before
has
such
a
delicate
strawberry
flavor
been
displayed
in
a
beer
thats
decidedly
a
wheaty
pilsner
and
then
executed
to
perfection
this
is
abita
at
their
best
uf
single
bottle
notched
as
best
by
october
5th
12oz
brown
bottle
with
best
before
october

notched
on
the
back
label
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
slight
pinkish
hue
one
finger
head
with
ok
longevity
and
good
lace
smells
fruity
champagne
like
but
not
much
else
noted
creamy
with
a
definate
strawberry
flavor
but
not
much
else
kind
of
like
a
lite
beer
with
strawbery
added
nice
neutral
mouthfeel
and
huge
drinkability
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
a
touch
more
malt
and
hops
would
be
nice
though
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
descent
white
head
that
retains
ok
the
aroma
is
where
this
beer
realy
stands
out
with
freshly
picked
strawberries
jumping
out
of
the
glass
as
well
as
a
sugary
sweetness
some
biscuit
slight
floral
hops
and
fruity
esters
the
flavor
has
some
slightly
artificial
strawberry
notes
along
with
some
table
sugar
sweetness
biscuit
vanilla
and
some
slight
herbal
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
drinkability
is
near
perfect
a
good
session
brew
not
too
complicated
or
radical
in
its
flavors
12
ounce
bottle
twist
off
cap
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
solid
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
head
comprised
of
big
bubbles
this
falls
fairly
fast
to
a
film
over
top
clarity
is
very
good
and
carbonation
is
not
really
active
in
the
glass
nose
is
definately
all
about
the
fresh
strawberry
its
sweet
strawberry
but
not
fake
with
a
light
creamy
aspect
to
it
i
think
it
smells
nice
flavor
is
not
as
dominated
with
the
strawberry
the
lager
base
comes
through
as
what
i
would
call
a
pilsner
without
the
hopping
but
is
very
clean
and
unobtrusive
this
fades
into
a
slightly
sweet
and
very
fruity
strawberry
i
was
not
expecting
to
enjoy
this
one
but
id
rather
be
suprised
this
direction
than
the
other
i
think
the
strawberry
and
the
mildly
grainey
almost
a
touch
of
chalkyness
of
the
base
beer
compliment
each
other
very
well
and
accentuate
the
fruit
character
without
it
being
overbearing
abita
has
my
attention
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
lively
moderate
carbonation
i
think
the
carbonation
level
is
ideal
for
the
brew
its
not
too
little
but
its
not
anything
that
is
providing
a
bite
that
would
interfere
with
the
flavor
drinkability
is
great
this
one
just
works
for
me
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
proportioned
just
right
excellent
edit
crazy
to
say
but
i
have
been
having
cravings
for
this
one
lately
im
really
enjoying
them
sampled
at
the
abita
brewpub
as
part
of
their
select
series
color
is
light
golden
with
little
head
the
aroma
is
of
strawberries
fairly
fresh
smelling
with
just
a
hint
of
lager
aroma
taste
is
quite
similar
to
petes
wicked
strawberry
blond
just
fresher
tasting
this
is
basically
a
lighter
american
lager
with
strawberry
flavoring
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
get
down
but
almost
everything
else
available
at
the
abita
brewpub
is
more
interesting
wouldnt
buy
again
but
not
bad
taste
is
pretty
bland
slight
dry
cherry
taste
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
i
was
expecting
something
different
once
i
smelled
it
i
can
definitely
see
where
people
have
said
its
cherry
cough
syrup
dr
pepper
i
had
such
low
expectations
with
this
beer
but
despite
the
overwhelming
cherry
aroma
the
taste
is
actually
good
a
nice
weizen
with
a
hinch
of
cherry
not
bad
at
all
i
had
this
beer
a
few
months
ago
thank
goodness
i
didnt
buy
it
a
friend
brought
a
six
pack
over
to
the
house
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
due
to
the
fact
im
from
boston
originally
back
to
the
beer
taste
horrible
dont
know
what
sam
adams
was
thinking
just
not
my
swag
at
all
i
am
not
into
any
fruity
beer
period
i
like
the
fact
the
company
tried
an
experiment
but
epic
fail
in
my
opinion
cough
syrup
and
dr
pepper
overly
sweet
and
fruity
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
again
i
can
only
drink
one
bottle
of
this
at
a
sitting
more
than
that
and
the
fruit
flavors
start
to
get
sickly
on
me
but
that
one
first
cold
bottle
for
me
is
a
good
one
the
cherry
is
brightly
fruity
and
pronounced
the
wheat
is
decent
but
i
suspect
could
be
better
this
beer
is
revolting
its
like
someone
mixed
a
wheat
beer
with
dr
pepper
i
got
sucked
in
by
having
bought
and
enjoyed
samuel
adams
cold
snap
which
is
pretty
good
but
when
it
ran
out
this
took
its
place
yuck
i
am
on
the
ground
with
minimal
sight
and
following
the
lights
to
the
exit
good
day
so
i
used
to
think
this
was
just
ok
until
i
took
a
tour
at
sam
adams
my
sister
had
given
me
a
goodie
from
her
law
school
and
apparently
most
of
the
tour
guides
were
law
students
they
let
us
stay
after
the
tour
and
when
they
washed
out
my
sample
glass
they
poured
me
the
cherry
wheat
on
draft
and
it
blew
my
mind
its
upsetting
that
the
stuff
outside
of
boston
comes
from
a
diffrent
brewery
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
ive
tasted
many
fruit
flavored
beers
and
cherry
wheat
does
it
right
its
a
great
beer
because
the
cherry
taste
is
very
well
assimilated
i
am
impressed
with
the
company
lately
and
they
are
one
of
the
bigger
ones
that
can
pull
novel
beers
like
this
off
the
taste
is
not
medicinal
or
anything
other
than
a
natural
overtone
i
liked
it
not
my
favorite
but
its
good
surprisingly
on
the
darker
side
with
a
definite
cherry
taste
not
as
fruity
as
one
might
think
though
tastes
pretty
much
like
cherry
coke
i
will
buy
one
every
now
and
then
o
i
am
so
torn
on
this
because
i
want
to
like
it
for
the
concept
it
does
do
a
few
things
right
there
are
some
great
subtle
flavors
in
there
like
the
biscuit
honey
and
malt
but
they
are
just
overpowered
by
the
impending
robitussinesque
combination
of
cherry
and
alcohol
i
mean
its
not
sink
pour
bad
but
i
would
definitely
only
use
it
as
a
last
resort
beer
at
a
party
you
didnt
want
to
go
to
but
are
now
stuck
at
for
several
hours
bit
disappointing
since
sam
adams
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
craftmajor
brews
but

one

good

and

cherry
a
little
more

good
aroma
refreshing
break
from
my
last
ipa
binge
come
on
you
guys
its
not
great
but
its
not
that
terrible
if
you
take
the
artificial
cherry
taste
from
cherry
coke
and
put
it
into
a
beer
this
is
what
you
get
great
beer
love
the
taste
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
tastes
a
bit
like
cherry
cough
syrup
added
to
beer
better
off
with
a
kriek
or
lambic
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
the
samuel
adams
line
excellent
flavor
and
nice
cloudy
appearance
as
a
wheat
beer
should
have
not
available
everywhere
ive
been
though
which
is
unfortunate
drain
pour
tastes
like
cough
syrup
maybe
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
love
sam
adams
but
this
is
cherry
robitussun
with
some
malts
hops
just
no
stop
too
sweet
and
taste
like
cough
medicine
cherries
and
beer
dont
really
mix
for
me
id
buy
a
sixer
of
this
and
store
it
in
my
fridge
its
about
like
blue
moon
in
the
way
that
it
would
probably
go
with
any
similar
food
pairings
i
like
it
not
being
a
fruit
beer
lover
maybe
i
am
not
giving
it
a
chance
fair
flavor
but
too
much
cherry
not
enough
wheat
nice
cherry
flavor
hops
and
pilsner
upfront
with
a
nice
mellow
cherry
sweetness
in
the
back
not
cloyingly
sweet
just
right
the
blend
of
cherry
and
wheat
beer
is
a
perfect
balance
when
youre
looking
for
a
good
honest
fruitforward
beer
great
in
the
summer
mixed
with
guinness
is
a
fun
mix
up
an
obvious
classic
any
time
of
year
any
food
pairing
pairs
well
with
cosmic
fog
milk
and
honey
ejuice
pleasant
aroma
heavy
of
cherry
thick
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
viscosity
is
a
bit
thick
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
the
artificial
cherry
flavor
stings
your
tounge
slightly
but
the
hoppy
wheat
like
flavor
kind
of
balances
it
out
an
easy
drinker
great
beer
overall
best
of
the
samuel
adams
brand
i
dont
like
fruit
in
my
beer
but
i
love
beer
and
i
love
cherries
i
love
this
beer
ahhh
sam
cherry
wheat
a
guilty
pleasure
of
mine
for
years
as
a
more
refined
beer
drinker
im
not
supposed
to
like
this
but
i
do
perhaps
since
it
is
brewed
with
mi
cherries
and
i
am
a
son
of
the
mitten
state
maybe
because
it
brings
me
back
to
my
youth
with
cherry
cough
syrup
nostalgia
or
possibly
because
its
just
a
unique
and
flavorful
beer
experience
that
conjures
fond
memories
poured
in
to
a
tulip
glass
it
fills
with
a
hazy
golden
honey
color
and
one
inch
of
white
froth
the
head
dissipated
quickly
leaving
only
a
thin
ring
atop
the
nectarlike
liquid
maraschino
cherries
and
honey
sweetness
in
the
nose
a
touch
of
cereal
grain
and
subtle
noble
hop
character
there
is
certainly
ample
cherry
flavor
that
brings
a
medicinal
quality
but
it
is
washed
away
in
the
finish
with
a
wheat
thin
like
aftertaste
the
hops
brighten
the
beer
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
average
but
suits
the
brew
well
it
is
deliciously
drinkable
for
such
a
polarizing
concoction
this
is
sure
to
turn
some
people
off
with
its
cherry
lozenge
likeness
but
to
others
its
a
perfect
pleasure
that
can
be
savored
on
occasion
i
typically
crush
these
pretty
quickly
so
maybe
savor
is
the
wrong
word
maybe
i
drink
them
fast
because
it
has
a
relatively
tame
abv
and
its
refreshing
or
possibly
because
i
want
to
hide
the
evidence
as
quickly
as
possible
either
way
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
these
from
time
to
time
great
first
sip
after
that
it
really
tastes
like
cough
syrup
anyone
that
buys
a
beer
that
has
a
fruit
in
its
name
and
then
complains
it
just
plain
ignorant
the
label
tells
you
exactly
what
youre
going
to
taste
and
for
what
it
is
its
darn
good
i
didnt
realize
they
were
doing
a
collaborations
with
robitussin
could
not
finish
it
gave
it
to
a
guy
i
didnt
like
my
favorite
sam
adams
a
friend
in
michigan
told
me
about
this
years
before
i
could
find
it
here
in
the
south
and
it
did
not
disappoint
this
a
beer
for
people
who
say
they
dont
like
beer
and
a
nice
dessert
for
beer
lovers
it
smells
as
sweet
as
it
tastes
but
is
amazingly
fresh
and
the
sweetness
doesnt
taste
artificial
but
genuinely
seems
to
come
from
the
cherries
tastes
like
sam
adams
with
cherry
cough
syrup
poured
in
it
not
for
me
surprisingly
intense
cherry
flavor
and
aroma
but
still
pretty
good
tasted
like
cherry
cough
medicine
absolutely
horrendous
mouthfeel
is
average
richness
but
not
much
else
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
there
is
not
enough
here
except
the
cherry
flavor
subpar
i
like
sam
adams
and
have
had
many
beers
from
them
and
i
tried
this
with
high
expectation
as
wheat
beers
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
bought
a
six
pack
smell
is
cherry
cough
drops
almost
and
sugary
with
a
little
hop
and
yeast
smell
color
is
light
red
maybe
almost
a
darker
pink
head
disappears
quickly
to
almost
nothing
but
with
lacing
the
taste
is
light
medium
feel
and
a
sugary
artificial
cherry
flavor
to
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
then
the
wheat
beer
comes
through
i
forced
finished
one
and
later
on
could
not
finish
the
second
because
the
flavor
just
became
unpleasant
and
ended
up
dumping
the
rest
actually
like
this
one
unlike
many
others
the
smell
and
taste
is
a
sweet
cherry
flavor
overall
like
most
fruit
beers
its
ok
as
a
weird
change
of
pace
curious
if
you
could
cook
with
it
desserts
maybe
otherwise
passable
now
keep
in
mind
ive
only
drank
this
warm
when
i
was
17
and
we
took
some
from
a
parent
nice
smooth
taste
that
you
would
expect
from
samuel
adams
with
a
heavy
cherry
finish
very
sweet
good
dessert
beer
ugh
undrinkable
on
its
own
it
really
shines
when
paired
with
a
guinness
or
youngs
chocolate
stout
in
a
half
n
half
try
it
you
may
be
surprised
never
drink
it
alone
though
thats
a
recipe
for
sadness
had
this
beer
2
years
ago
its
good
for
a
sam
adams
of
all
the
wheats
i
have
tried
this
one
is
the
only
one
id
actually
buy
a
6pack
of
in
the
summertime
maybe
its
because
i
like
cherries
so
much
i
dont
know
but
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
exceptional
wheat
beer
brewed
with
cherries
a
favorite
of
mine
during
the
summer
months
strong
cherry
candy
aroma
good
but
not
great
too
much
cherry
flavor
and
too
fillingnot
a
sessionable
beer
has
to
be
the
worst
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
totally
unbalanced
very
tart
to
begin
with
but
soon
over
powered
by
the
excessive
hop
bitterness
i
do
not
like
bitter
things
it
may
be
a
fruit
beer
for
hopheads
but
ill
be
pouring
the
second
bottle
down
the
sink
i
dont
dislike
anyone
enough
to
give
it
to
them
that
being
said
i
thought
i
would
like
the
cherry
flavor
but
it
just
seems
a
little
off
to
me
jmas
overall
i
have
a
few
other
miscellaneous
samuel
adams
offerings
lurking
in
my
fridge
that
i
cant
wait
to
try
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
all
around
from
its
unexpectedly
different
appearance
to
the
taste
it
leaves
in
your
mouth
after
youve
finished
it
overall
pretty
nice
would
drink
again
o
very
good
beer
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
cherry
flavor
but
to
each
his
own
cheers
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
and
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
receded
to
a
thin
cap
of
foam
leaving
moderate
lacing
down
the
glass
quite
nice
looking
scents
of
cherries
a
bit
of
cream
not
much
else
a
simple
fruity
aroma
flavor
is
rather
subdued
but
pleasant
beginning
with
cherry
with
a
faint
medicinal
hop
undertone
in
the
middle
wheat
malt
graininess
joins
the
profile
and
hop
flavors
are
grassy
and
slightly
medicinal
finish
is
sweet
with
notes
of
cherry
and
low
levels
of
grassy
hop
bitterness
aftertaste
is
grassy
hops
and
grainy
malt
a
nicely
fruity
fairly
refreshing
wheat
beer
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
on
the
finish
refreshing
and
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
fairly
nice
pale
wheat
with
a
nice

the

things
were

is

than

lambicuntil
i
actually
tasted
it
a
medicinal
introduction
a
drag
of
an
aftertaste
and
not
really
much
to
savor
in
between
this
beer
at
first
sip
taste
a
little
bitter
like
cough
medicine
but
it
goes
away
almost
immediately
and
as
one
continues
to
drink
it
it
tastes
smooth
and
refreshing
i
dont
think
it
is
a
beer
that
will
appeal
to
everyone
since
one
has
to
get
used
to
the
taste
but
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
and
although
it
is
not
a
style
that
i
purchase
too
often
i
do
buy
the
cherry
wheat
every
once
in
a
while
for
a
different
taste
the
obvious
and
must
abundant
ingredient
it
the
cherry
flavoring
i
enjoy
a
little
bit
of
fruity
taste
in
beers
after
my
initial
taste
i
could
also
detect
a
small
trace
of
honey
in
the
recipe
that
really
made
for
a
smooth
blend
that
was
light
and
crisp
cherry
wheat
is
in
my
top
ten
of
samuel
adams
brews
has
good
flavor
not
overpowering
great
wheat
flavor
not
too
filling
has
decent
cherry
aroma
with
slight
wheat
aroma
too
low
of
alcohol
content
for
me
when
i
have
a
beer
i
like
some
what
of
a
kick
cherry
wheat
did
not
have
much
of
one
to
sum
it
up
ill
probably
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
not
too
often
or
any
time
in
the
near
future
a
decent
tasting
wheat
very
refreshing
you
can
definitely
taste
the
cherry
but
it
over
powers
the
wheat
flavor
just
a
hair
to
much
for
me
little
to
no
head
has
a
very
good
smell
you
can
really
smell
the
cherry
a
solid
wheat
beer
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
either
would
be
great
on
a
warm
day
overall
extremely
unique
definitely
a
session
beer
delicious
but
would
like
to
taste
more
malt
overall
it
tastes
like
a
cherry
wheat
beer
the
cherry
component
is
really
spoton
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
rough
around
the
edges
samuel
adams
cherry
wheat
35
pours
a
light
golden
hazy
amber
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
when
first
opened
the
smell
of
cherries
and
wheat
hits
you
right
in
the
face
or
actually
nose
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
quite
to
the
aroma
but
is
very
pleasant
overall
smooth
to
drink
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
samuel
adams
cherry
wheat
pours
out
with
a
small
white
head
you
can
tell
its
a
non
filtered
brew
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
smell
right
off
the
bat
is
cherry
there
is
really
nothing
else
to
it
i
cant
smell
anything
else
the
taste
is
also
cherry
nothing
more
than
that
not
much
else
to
say
but
cherry
if
you
like
cherry
you
may
like
this
brew
this
brew
is
not
for
me
it
looks
good
but
the
taste
is
too
much
blech
fruit
beers
just
arent
for
me
however
my
husband
loves
the
crap
out
of
this
beer
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
mix
of
bad
cherry
candy
or
cough
medicine
mixed
with
a
decent
wheat
beer
if
the
cherry
flavor
was
a
bit
more
subtle
i
think
id
like
it
a
lot
better
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
clear
golden
color
and
a
nice
white
foam
head
aroma
is
distinctly
cherry
the
mix
of
wheat
and
cherry
makes
for
an
enjoyable
flavor
ive
had
some
beers
where
the
fruity
flavor
ruins
it
but
theres
just
the
right
balance
of
cherry
and
wheat
beer
in
this
brew
overall
not
bad
would
definitely
enjoy
again
i
was
disappointed
with
the
appearance
was
hoping
for
at
least
a
reddish
tint
the
smell
was
redeeming
smell
of
natural
cherry
taste
is
a
nice
cherry
at
first
but
the
wheat
takes
over
and
is
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
great
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
fan
would
not
recommend
if
you
dont
like
cherries
and
still
want
to
give
this
a
try
dont
overall
a
good
dessert
beer
the
wheat
character
isnt
quite
what
i
would
like
but
it
overall
is
still
pretty
good
would
also
prefer
if
it
was
unfiltered
maybe
more
like
a
cherry
hefeweizen
i
was
never
a
beer
drinker
until
my
boyfriend
introduced
me
to
cherry
wheat
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
would
say
that
compared
to
other
beers
that
this
has
a
very
smooth
taste
with
subtle
hints
of
summer
and
an
introduction
to
fall
all
mixed
into
one
it
smells
fruity
but
still
has
that
distinctive
smell
of
beer
with
the
presence
of
hops
giving
it
a
rustic
feel
i
am
now
hooked
on
sam
adams
shame
on
me
for
not
getting
more
interested
in
beer
in
college
overall
not
something
i
would
choose
on
my
own
but
not
a
bad
beer
o
they
bring
the
cherry
now
its
up
to
you
to
accept
the
consequences
o
was
impressed
until
the
taste
it
was
nothing
after
the
beer
went
down
i
have
liked
most
of
sammys
offerings
this
year
but
this
is
a
total
fail
jim
koch
must
not
have
tasted
this
one
as
it
came
out
of
the
brewery
because
its
completely
undrinkable
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
lasting
lacing
wonderful
nose
of
cherry
light
medium
body
with
a
smooth
feel
low
average
carbonation
crisp
with
a
good
burst
of
cherry
flavor
lightly
hopped
as
it
should
be
my
sa
favorite
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
started
homebrewing
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
since
1995
when
you
get
a
good
bottle
very
crisp
finish
and
tart
cherry
flavor
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
however
over
the
years
they
have
had
quality
problems
the
last
few
years
they
have
been
more
consistent
o
this
is
drinkable
sure
but
why
i
dont
know
i
guess
youd
have
to
ask
the
19
year
old
lance
this
was
his
favorite
beer
i
wonder
how
much
my
taste
will
change
in
another
12
years
hmmm
o
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
the
taste
is
of
cherry
cough
medicine
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
at
all
overall
an
old
time
favorite
and
one
that
i
find
refreshing
i
try
to
get
a
six
of
this
a
year
the
cherries
are
present
but
never
too
sweet
one
of
sams
better
classic
beers
as
far
as
food
pairingsperhaps
would
be
nice
with
some
block
cheese
and
crackersgrapescherries
of
courseother
crisp
fruits
like
apples
or
pearsgoes
very
nice
with
a
slice
of
cherry
piecheers
and
peace2all
overall
a
nice
relaxing
beer
to
have
enjoyable
with
a
cherry
taste
o
the
artificial
cherry
flavor
and
strong
corn
flavor
make
it
hard
to
drink
and
any
other
flavors
are
well
hidden
underneath
those
o
not
impressed
many
samuel
adams
beers
have
earned
my
respects
this
is
not
one
of
them
granted
the
sweetness
will
be
loved
by
many
drinkers
just
not
this
one
i
honestly
cannot
understand
the
widespread
appeal
of
this
in
the
same
manner
of
twizzlers
and
cough
syrup
this
is
far
to
sweet
and
cloying
under
longterm
consumption
theres
not
much
balance
to
this
and
while
this
could
be
refreshing
it
would
have
to
be
pounded
to
avoid
the
cloying
sweetness
from
creeping
up
to
room
temperature
really
weird
stuff
i
actually
love
cherries
and
krieks
even
those
that
are
sweetened
but
rather
than
being
dessertlike
or
robust
this
tastes
unusually
artificial
and
candied
i
might
as
well
get
a
cheap
wheat
beer
and
fill
it
with
homemade
cherry
syrup
in
the
same
vein
of
berliner
weisses
im
starting
to
wonder
by
now
if
any
wheat
beer
infused
with
fruit
flavoring
is
worth
my
time
we
shall
see
until
my
palate
gives
up
flavors
of
cherry
vanilla
soda
light
ginger
lemongrass
apricot
overall
relatively
light
refreshing
sweet
with
a
slight
spice
and
bitterness
o
i
like
how
the
flavors
changed
a
lot
from
beginning
to
the
end

d
i
purchased
a
bunch
of
sa
beers
just
for
the
sake
of
reviewing
them
here
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
i
always
wasnt
expecting
that
bbc
turned
into
an
adult
fruit
drink
company
i
used
to
really
like
this
stuff
when
i
first
started
drinking
beer
not
so
much
now
o
the
appearance
and
smell
are
extremely
deceptive
the
taste
just
does
not
stand
up
to
expectations
i
had
a
hard
time
making
it
through
one
bottle
and
couldnt
even
think
about
a
whole
six
pack
ive
had
some
wonderful
tart
cherry
beers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
work
they
should
have
made
it
a
berliner
weisse
it
may
have
been
a
little
more
tart
then
but
at
least
it
would
have
a
clean
refreshing
flavor
i
usually
rate
sam
adams
in
the
upper
end
of
mediocre
sometimes
above
but
this
is
a
definite
flop
tastes
of
tart
cherry
and
sourdough
bread
a
little
off
putting
and
first
drink
felt
chalky
in
my
mouth
i
really
like
cherries
but
this
was
hard
to
finish
and
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
why
this
beer
is
not
terrible
and
i
will
probably
give
it
another
try
sometime
but
cannot
honestly
say
it
will
be
anytime
soon
not
as
terrible
as
many
make
it
out
to
be
still
nothing
special
this
beer
smells
delicious
very
strong
scent
of
cherries
and
very
strong
taste
of
cherries
quite
refreshing
but
a
little
overpowering
at
times
the
only
thing
that
is
not
satisfactory
is
that
the
beer
stains
the
lines
at
bars
and
whatever
is
put
on
after
the
cherry
wheat
ends
up
having
a
faintold
taste
of
cherries
the
cherry
taste
is
delightful
but
a
bit
too
boastful
this
is
not
beer
this
is
why
i
cant
buy
sam
adams
variety
packs
i
always
end
up
with
3
of
these
nasty
bastards
sorry
for
that
profanity
but
it
is
appropriate
here
dont
waste
your
money
even
if
you
your
looking
for
something
thats
a
flavored
brew
o
still
tastes
the
same
after
all
these
years
amazing
i
loathe
to
admit
it
but
its
not
all
that
bad
a
brew
quirky
and
gimmicky
yes
but
despite
the
quasiartificiality
of
the
cherry
flavor
the
balance
and
flavor
profile
is
quite
fine
and
i
dare
say
i
could
have
another
lord
knows
i
downed
a
six
pack
just
about
day
before
noon
on
that
spring
break
poured
this
cherry
wheat
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
a
small
white
head
average
retention
and
an
ample
amount
of
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
soft
wheat
and
maraschino
cherries
aroma
is
outstanding
light
in
body
the
foundation
contained
malted
wheat
and
tart
cherries
for
a
fruit
beer
crisp
refreshing
and
a
nice
session
beer
o
just
as
i
remembered
it
i
just
cant
get
into
beers
whose
primary
component
comes
across
as
artificial
i
could
see
this
being
refreshing
during
the
summer
at
a
party
where
everyone
drinks
macros
but
other
than
that
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
it
o
great
beer
not
sure
why
its
rated
so
low
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
one
but
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
favorite
sam
adams
by
far
will
buy
again
well
i
dont
want
to
seem
too
negative
reviewing
this
product
because
you
really
cant
be
too
negative
reviewing
it
if
you
really
love
drinking
beer
buuuh
save
yourself
the
trouble
with
this
one
the
cherry
is
just
way
too
overdone
and
overpowering
nearly
to
the
point
of
being
undrinkable
and
its
not
the
fruitlambic
kind
of
cherry
its
more
of
a
take
your
medicine
kind
of
cherry
definitely
not
for
me
o
way
to
sweet
for
my
taste
buds
but
i
might
have
found
a
beer
my
girlfriend
would
like
seems
way
to
sweet
for
a
cherry
wheat
as
if
its
jam
packed
with
cherry
artificial
flavors
rather
than
the
natural
tartness
i
was
looking
for
overall
in
all
honesty
this
beer
grosses
me
the
hell
out
lol
the
only
thing
i
liked
was
the
mouthfeel
if
this
sounds
good
to
you
youll
probably
like
it
it
was
just
ok
im
not
a
fan
of
the
artificial
cherry
flavor
even
though
i
know
its
brewed
with
real
cherries
it
still
comes
off
tasting
like
robotussin
at
times
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
poured
into
standard
beer
glass
light
head
and
light
amber
color
excellent
aroma
refreshing
and
flavorful
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
great
wheat
base
with
the
crisp
cherry
notes
the
perfect
ratio
of
beer
to
cherry
not
to
much
not
to
little
a
great
beer
to
have
year
round
overall
excellent
cherry
wheat
well
balanced
and
flavorful
always
enjoy
this
brew
this
beer
is
a
light
cloudy
amber
color
not
much
head
smells
wonderful
now
im
not
great
at
describing
flovors
but
it
tastes
great
cold
bubbly
and
sweet
with
a
toasty
wheat
finish
really
nice
if
sam
adams
fruits
the
beer
im
fine
with
it
this
beer
is
amazing
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
which
i
dont
usually
enjoy
but
in
this
case
it
seems
to
be
done
wonderfully
i
had
it
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
was
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
appearance
is
like
a
light
weizen
not
red
like
i
expected
the
smell
is
beautiful
with
a
bright
cherry
scent
the
taste
is
brilliant
cherry
as
i
said
sweet
but
not
overbearing
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
definitely
nothing
left
over
but
a
great
taste
overall
i
highly
recommend
it
even
for
a
flavored
beer
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
amber
with
a
fine
thin
white
head
and
light
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
cherry
juice
wheat
and
a
hint
of
biscuit
malt
flavor
is
light
wheat
bready
malt
and
cherry
juice
cherry
is
not
as
dominating
as
in
the
aroma
finishes
dry
with
light
hops
and
sour
cherry
slightly
astringent
nice
medium
body
surprising
light
creaminess
for
a
low
abv
wheat
beer
i
liked
this
better
than
i
thought
i
would
the
initial
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
different
finish
is
a
bit
unbalanced
and
sharp
interesting
thanks
bry
for
the
bottle
if
the
cherry
flavor
wasnt
quite
as
medicinal
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
light
beer
at
all
with
each
sip
the
fruit
flavor
just
seems
to
feel
more
and
more
fake
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
yellow
with
only
a
slight
oranging
to
suggest
the
cherries
i
sits
in
the
glass
as
a
murky
gold
with
some
nice
bubbles
of
carbonation
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
but
this
mellows
down
into
just
a
scrim
though
it
does
regenerate
when
agitated
lacing
for
this
beer
is
negligible
the
beer
smells
like
cherry
coke
the
cherry
is
far
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
natural
cherries
but
reminds
me
of
a
maraschino
cherry
which
is
a
nice
smell
im
not
expecting
this
to
be
the
most
natural
beer
but
the
candied
smell
is
definitely
intriguing
the
malt
body
hops
and
yeast
are
all
overpowered
by
the
cherries
except
for
the
smallest
ghost
of
a
suggestion
of
biscuitiness
the
beer
tastes
like
a
bready
cherry
cola
the
aftertaste
is
well
built
with
buttery
biscuit
and
only
a
faint
cherry
sweet
that
goes
slightly
vegetal
the
initial
sip
however
was
heavy
with
sweet
cherries
though
the
very
initial
taste
is
surprisingly
heavy
with
the
biscuit
malts
but
the
cherries
quickly
wash
them
away
to
suggest
cherry
cola
mouthfeel
is
a
little
prickly
with
the
carbonation
leaving
a
slight
tingle
but
thick
and
creamy
in
the
initial
sip
which
that
mellows
into
a
watery
feeling
the
mouth
is
left
with
the
cloying
feel
of
sweet
cherries
but
little
of
the
flavor
and
a
slight
dry
burn
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
tingles
beneath
the
light
trickle
of
saliva
your
mouth
works
up
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
its
smell
and
flavor
are
actually
quite
good
but
the
mouthfeel
really
pulls
it
back
in
scoring
it
is
actually
quite
good
for
what
the
company
was
going
for
as
this
is
a
refreshing
and
tasty
fruit
beer
that
is
easily
mass
produced
i
compare
this
more
to
a
cherry
cola
than
to
a
beer
and
i
really
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
due
to
their
cloying
nature
but
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
sip
when
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
different
poured
hazy
gold
with
a
small
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
was
cherry
and
bread
taste
was
cherry
surpise
up
front
and
strong
with
some
grain
and
an
acidicmetallic
flavor
the
beer
finished
with
a
cherry
flavor
lingering
for
quite
a
while
i
like
cherry
so
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
and
would
drink
again
i
normally
like
sam
adams
but
this
one
was
nothing
too
write
home
about
even
in
the
sweltering
heat
one
was
enough
i
am
going
to
ignore
the
mostly
poor
ratings
by
others
although
i
admit
to
be
a
beer
taste
rookie
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
am
a
fan
of
cherry
flavor
cherry
coke
dr
pepper
etc
as
well
as
wheat
beer
in
general
i
found
the
amount
of
cherry
just
right
though
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
heavy
id
definitely
buy
it
again
pours
a
clear
light
reddishorange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
wheat
grain
and
some
artificial
cherry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
almost
sickening
medicinal
cherry
flavor
that
lingers
long
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
poor
beer
that
is
pretty
gross
and
undrinkable
surprising
cherry
smell
it
was
completely
unexpected
by
far
the
best
sam
adams
ive
had
i
like
the
slightly
reddish
tinge
to
the
dark
colored
beer
and
it
poured
a
good
head
overall
i
was
pleased
and
would
definitely
spend
some
change
to
have
this
beer
in
my
fridge
again
had
this
on
tap
at
atlanta
airport
nice
presentation
with
an
interesting
amber
clouded
clour
adequate
1
finger
white
head
that
stuck
around
a
bit
smell
was
a
bit
of
some
dulled
cherries
and
some
yeast
nothing
remarkable
taste
was
pretty
decent
i
will
preface
this
by
saying
i
grew
up
on
michigan
cherries
and
enjoy
that
tart
over
the
top
taste
that
being
said
i
didnt
get
the
medicine
taste
as
others
have
pointed
out
a
definite
fruit
beer
that
imo
is
a
good
combination
and
quite
drinkable
feel
was
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
medium
body
overall
i
think
it
a
pretty
good
effort
from
sa
i
like
the
tartness
and
blend
of
the
hops
that
evident
probably
need
to
really
enjoy
cherries
for
this
one
to
go
down
smoothly
an
interesting
blend
that
i
would
drink
again
so
all
in
all
not
bad
and
if
fruit
beer
is
your
thing
go
for
it
if
youre
a
strictly
beer
or
malty
bready
type
like
me
who
prefers
that
a
hop
or
fruit
overload
stay
out
of
his
mug
or
growler
or
even
a
singledoubletriple
ipa
guy
who
would
eat
a
handful
of
hop
flowers
on
his
own
free
will
reach
for
another
beer
at
the
711
this
one
is
too
much
fruit
not
enough
beer
ojust
cant
get
by
the
cough
syrup
taste
a
very
interesting
beer
i
recommend
you
try
this
out
as
much
as
people
seem
to
dislike
this
beer
a
70
rating
on
this
site
for
a
sam
adams
beer
is
really
quite
low
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
one
of
their
top
sellers
i
dont
know
that
im
just
taking
a
guess
i
feel
its
super
popular
among
women
i
could
be
wrong
though
cherry
wheat
should
have
been
tasty
instead
it
tastes
a
little
bit
like
medicine
beer
medicine
like
the
liquid
stuff
my
mom
used
to
feed
me
when
i
was
a
kid
once
you
get
passed
that
odd
taste
the
rest
of
it
isnt
so
bad
maybe
i
just
have
some
sort
of
bad
association
with
that
particular
flavor
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
murky
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
leaving
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
faint
cherries
and
robitussin
nothing
else
the
taste
is
of
cherries
and
somewhat
of
light
toasted
barley
and
malt
absolutely
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
allows
the
complete
medicinal
flavor
to
come
through
seriously
tasted
like
robitussin
nighttime
if
you
let
it
sit
for
long
enough
oh
well
i
didnt
pay
for
it
so
whatever
a
terrible
offering
by
sam
adams
even
worse
than
the
summer
ale
just
wow
i
picked
up
a
mixed
pack
and
this
was
the
worst
of
the
bunch
this
is
incredibly
pleasant
despite
the
fact
that
it
makes
little
celebration
of
hops
and
malt
i
think
this
is
meant
as
a
tool
to
get
people
interested
in
different
beers
for
that
i
like
it
its
a
bit
onedimensional
but
tasty
indeed
it
might
be
fun
to
cook
with
this
hey
its
in
a
summer
pack
after
all
lighten
up
stephen
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
probably
my
least
favorite
from
sam
adams
would
have
been
solid
if
the
cherry
was
more
subtle
onot
my
favorite
but
i
could
drink
it
great
fruit
beer
i
keep
buying
this
without
the
intent
of
getting
it
because
i
like
to
try
many
different
brews
but
for
some
reason
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
to
me
its
got
a
great
summer
cherry
nutty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
great
brew
while
cutting
the
grass
or
working
in
the
garage
etc
i
like
it
o
i
feel
this
is
a
really
good
cherry
beer
a
little
heavy
handed
in
the
aroma
but
a
great
flavor
profile
like
many
of
their
beers
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
nice
to
have
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
fruity
beer
these
are
unkind
reviews
this
is
actually
a
pretty
damn
good
fruit
beer
it
pours
rather
plain
looking
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
like
fresh
black
cherries
floral
and
juicy
with
plenty
of
wheat
malts
and
a
fairly
mild
yeast
strain
flavor
is
major
cherry
all
the
way
through
not
dissimilar
to
the
cherry
vanilla
yogurts
ive
seen
around
in
the
groceries
its
got
that
sort
of
sweet
fresh
fruit
element
that
i
really
like
it
bitters
for
a
second
and
then
rounds
out
at
the
end
id
like
so
see
a
more
funky
yeast
get
into
the
mix
saison
style
or
something
i
think
that
would
give
this
beer
a
real
kick
in
the
crotch
but
its
tasty
as
it
is
in
my
opinion
feel
is
light
and
gassy
good
in
summer
and
also
with
a
certain
holiday
appeal
samuel
adams
cherry
wheat
is
a
refreshing
brew
and
it
makes
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
know
that
some
will
be
turned
off
by
the
fruitiness
and
while
i
generally
do
not
go
for
fruit
beers
myself
i
find
the
medium
body
and
tartness
sufficient
to
enjoy
this
beer
and
recommend
it
for
your
next
encounter
with
hot
weather
im
really
surprised
by
this
beer
i
havent
tried
it
in
10
years
and
my
memories
of
it
were
not
kind
i
am
pleased
to
report
it
is
actually
pretty
amazing
overall
a
decent
fruit
beer
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
notes
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
last
reviewed
this
beer
from
a
tap
version
4
years
ago
tonight
kind
of
cool
huh
o
not
much
going
on
with
this
one
but
i
dont
mind
it
not
very
good
but
not
terrible
either
overall
this
comes
out
pretty
decent
for
a
fruit
wheat
beer
fruits
are
sweet
but
not
overbearing
a
nice
summer
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
wheat
but
what
really
comes
through
strongly
is
a
ton
of
syrupy
cherry
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
the
sweet
syrupy
cherry
notes
coming
through
up
front
i
also
get
some
wheat
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
i
dont
like
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
is
was
an
average
example
of
a
cherry
wheat
beer
i
can
see
why
some
people
like
it
but
to
me
not
enough
good
beer
qualitys
shine
through
this
beer
doesnt
have
good
drinkability
not
that
smooth
with
the
high
sweetness
and
medicinal
flavors
one
is
more
then
enough
for
me
theres
no
way
i
would
want
another
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
if
looked
pretty
nice
and
had
some
good
head
retention
along
with
a
nice
color
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
and
the
artificial
cherrys
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
to
me
they
hurt
this
beer
and
were
not
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
and
i
hate
when
they
throw
this
in
their
variety
packs
when
they
do
its
always
my
least
favorite
of
the
pack
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
theres
much
better
fruit
beers
out
there
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
never
have
been
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
appeals
to
a
lot
of
people
so
theres
no
chance
of
it
changing
anytime
soon
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
fruit
beer
i
would
much
rather
have
a
shorts
soft
parade
i
think
its
a
far
superior
beer
this
beer
just
isnt
for
me
hope
the
next
one
i
try
from
you
guys
is
much
better
originally
reviewed
06202011
i
cant
really
get
down
with
the
taste
unless
im
in
the
mood
for
it
its
a
light
american
wheat
base
but
damn
its
got
cough
syrup
cherry
flavors
everywhere
it
gets
more
balanced
as
i
drink
it
i
get
more
adjunct
corn
grains
and
less
of
that
cherry
flavor
but
that
cough
syrup
cherry
flavor
still
stays
at
the
forefront
d
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
thin
and
watery
with
the
sweetness
a
bit
too
much
a
touch
like
cough
syrup
o
this
is
an
average
fruit
beer
its
a
average
wheat
beer
with
an
average
amount
of
cherries
its
still
pretty
tasty
and
much
better
than
the
nose
suggests
but
theres
just
not
enough
of
anything
here
to
bring
it
to
a
higher
level
its
one
of
the
weaker
beers
in
the
sam
adams
catalogue
but
definitely
still
drinkable
easy
to
see
why
this
beer
gets
some
hate
the
cherries
come
off
as
kinda
artificial
but
its
somewhat
wellrounded
the
interplay
of
flavors
is
good
tasty
in
its
own
way
o
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
beer
that
i
want
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
it
is
a
little
too
artificial
cherry
for
me
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
beverage
but
not
a
profound
one
in
any
way
seems
to
be
the
perfect
beer
to
accompany
chocolates
or
a
jelly
doughnut
still
its
passable
on
drinkability
overall
a
great
beer
drink
it
year
round
if
im
not
in
the
mood
for
a
sam
boston
or
a
wild
craft
choice
easy
to
find
wherever
you
are
if
your
in
a
pinch
and
want
something
out
of
the
ordinary
o
pretty
tasty
but
just
really
one
note
but
it
has
its
place
really
good
for
the
summer
overall
with
great
flavor
aroma
mouthfeel
and
price
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
out
there
it
is
a
great
balance
between
malt
and
fruit
making
this
one
fantastic
and
great
drinking
brew
cloudy
overall
with
a
nice
head
in
my
weiss
glass
decent
lacing
with
a
lingering
cover
of
white
foam
smell
is
very
cherry
with
light
wheat
malt
twang
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
taste
is
not
bad
with
a
strong
dose
of
cherries
and
mild
bitterness
a
touch
of
a
metallic
edge
that
lingers
in
the
finish
feel
is
light
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
quenching
dryness
overall
a
decent
beer
if
you
like
cherry
flavors
this
is
better
than
decent
it
brings
the
taste
and
drinkability
of
a
good
summer
quaffer
with
the
cherries
driving
the
beer
bus
worth
a
try
either
way
as
it
kinda
grows
on
you
if
you
like
wheat
styles
like
hefe
or
wit
overall
a
simple
cherry
beer
if
you
like
cherries
youll
at
least
like
it
if
not
then
probably
best
to
avoid
its
nothing
special
but
i
do
dig
the
flavor
overall
would
definately
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
lawnmower
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
outstanding
overall
not
crazy
over
fruit
brews
but
this
definitely
isnt
a
bad
one
never
hurts
to
have
one
dont
like
who
cares
your
girlfriend
will
drink
the
rest
salud
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
lively
and
refreshing
as
a
rule
of
thumb
if
you
hate
cherries
do
not
drink
this
beer
maybe
im
a
bit
of
a
sucker
for
these
fruit
beers
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
id
definitely
give
it
another
try
its
not
horrible
though
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
not
give
to
people
unless
i
wanted
never
to
see
them
again
got
two
of
the
damned
things
with
my
sa
summer
sampler
the
kolsch
and
belgian
session
had
better
be
spectacular
to
make
me
buy
another
12
because
the
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
is
punishment
from
god
o
dont
go
into
drinking
this
thinking
it
will
be
subtle
cherry
because
it
is
not
just
a
hint
the
cherry
consumes
this
beer
also
dont
drink
this
if
you
dont
like
your
beers
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
and
thats
an
understatement
it
might
get
low
ratings
but
i
for
one
enjoyed
it
probably
because
1
i
like
cherries
a
lot
and
2
because
i
like
sweet
beers
a
lot
you
are
warned
o
i
could
imagine
this
beer
would
appeal
more
to
non
wheat
beer
drinkers
and
possibly
could
be
a
good
intro
for
craft
beer
neophytes
to
the
brand
overall
in
1994
i
thought
this
was
the
best
beer
on
the
planet
i
still
think
this
is
a
darn
fine
tasting
beer
and
is
easily
enjoyable
great
taste
i
dont
think
i
have
tried
something
similar
before
sweet
and
spicy
medium
thickness
on
the
body
and
light
carbonation
o
avoid
unless
you
like
adult
koolaid
o
while
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
it
is
an
easydrinking
wheat
beer
that
could
be
a
nice
gateway
o
a
lot
of
people
i
know
like
the
cherry
wheat
however
i
find
it
to
be
a
huge
disappointment
the
smell
is
way
too
artificial
and
there
isnt
much
taste
in
my
opinion
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
however
there
are
a
few
good
ones
out
there
the
cherry
wheat
unfortunately
is
not
one
of
those
it
is
not
terrible
it
is
decently
sessionable
but
definitely
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
a
lot
fruit
beers
are
tricky
and
this
one
pulls
it
off
wheat
dryness
and
cherry
dryness
go
well
together
did
i
mention
this
is
dry
and
tart
maybe
a
bit
too
much
cherry
going
on
worth
a
try
and
a
good
beer
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
and
one
of
the
first
beers
to
turn
me
onto
craft
beer
well
balanced
drinkability
is
very
high
onice
offering
if
you
like
cherries
pretty
straight
forward
beer
with
out
much
complexity
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
the
first
of
its
style
for
me
it
smells
very
strongly
of
black
cherries
it
really
dominates
on
the
nose
but
you
can
pick
up
other
smells
like
brown
sugar
it
drinks
just
as
it
smells
black
cherries
the
taste
isnt
as
strong
as
the
smell
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
still
dominant
it
also
has
some
light
grain
and
wheat
flavors
this
beer
has
a
surprisingly
full
mouth
feel
its
not
the
ideal
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
the
texture
is
all
there
it
has
a
dry
and
cherry
flavored
aftertaste
which
is
really
take
it
or
leave
it
to
me
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
sam
adams
certainly
not
their
flagship
beer
its
decent
for
what
it
is
and
is
good
enough
to
spark
some
interest
in
the
style
for
me
overall
i
am
a
little
torn
on
this
beer
the
cherry
flavor
is
nice
but
it
is
a
little
too
overpowering
and
the
finish
is
really
not
very
good
overall
i
think
the
thing
that
really
made
me
not
care
for
this
beer
is
it
got
progressively
worse
as
i
made
it
through
my
glass
almost
to
the
point
where
i
didnt
want
to
finish
it
i
thought
the
execution
was
poor
but
it
was
interesting
to
see
what
they
were
getting
at
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
single
finger
of
white
fluff
for
a
head
smells
of
tart
fresh
black
cherries
almonds
and
light
amounts
of
wheat
flavor
contains
more
of
the
same
as
the
nose
but
also
a
faint
finish
of
herbal
hopping
at
the
very
end
body
is
somewhat
thin
but
carbonation
is
alright
the
main
flaw
in
this
beer
that
i
can
pick
out
is
that
the
cherries
are
right
up
on
the
edge
of
getting
too
cloying
sweet
cough
syrup
in
nature
rjt
o
nothing
unexpected
for
the
style
its
not
worldclass
but
its
certainly
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
summer
day
and
be
plenty
happy
o
kind
of
underwhelming
no
need
to
avoid
it
and
if
this
kind
of
thing
appeals
to
you
i
imagine
it
could
be
somebodys
favorite
definitely
not
mine
i
wish
it
was
better
because
i
love
fruit
beers
and
wheat
beers
this
should
have
been
a
slam
dunk
oh
well
thoughts
while
i
am
generally
not
a
big
samuel
adams
fan
i
have
been
trying
these
out
of
respect
to
my
fellow
connoisseurs
so
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
other
wont
touch
it
as
i
do
bbq
using
a
cherry
wood
this
helped
bring
the
taste
out
a
bit
more
nice
combo
o
this
is
a
decent
fruit
beer
but
i
dont
feel
that
it
pulls
everything
together
the
brewers
at
the
boston
beer
company
really
should
have
used
fresh
cherries
only
and
not
included
natural
flavorings
in
this
brew
as
it
could
benefit
greatly
from
the
melding
of
cherry
and
wheat
tartness
that
would
likely
result
as
is
its
just
a
tad
too
sweet
and
the
natural
grainy
tartness
of
the
wheat
clashes
with
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
and
cherry
flavoring
o
a
good
beer
though
its
hard
for
me
to
call
it
that
it
seems
like
a
cherryflavored
mixed
drink
with
bread
its
something
ill
remember
to
pick
up
in
the
future
oif
i
had
this
blind
i
might
doubt
that
it
was
beer
not
a
good
beer
because
it
is
more
like
a
fizzy
alcoholic
beverage
that
the
ladies
like
to
down
bottle
poured
into
tulip
glass
a
light
golden
hue
with
a
small
creamy
head
smell
was
distinctly
wheat
malt
with
a
dry
tone
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
cherry
twinge
in
the
back
smooth
on
the
palate
and
goes
down
well
i
have
already
gone
thru
a
couple
of
cases
of
this
in
the
past
few
months
when
opening
the
bottle
you
really
get
a
strong
cherry
scent
which
was
somewhat
misleading
because
the
cherry
flavor
is
not
very
strong
colorwise
it
a
standard
wheat
beer
color
with
a
slightly
redish
hue
i
really
like
this
beer
for
the
fallwinter
othis
is
average
maybe
if
i
was
a
cherry
person
i
would
say
different
i
am
being
generous
due
to
me
not
liking
cherries
pretty
light
beer
i
will
say
they
did
a
very
good
job
of
making
a
fruit
beer
though
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
in
the
sense
of
blending
the
flavor
with
beer
most
the
time
it
seems
to
taste
artificial
or
not
mix
well
or
not
have
much
of
the
fruit
flavor
the
beer
looks
good
it
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
and
foam
at
the
top
and
lots
of
little
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
the
bubbles
are
hard
to
make
out
because
the
beer
is
opaque
which
is
surprising
because
of
how
light
gold
the
color
is
the
smell
is
unlike
anything
ive
had
in
a
beer
before
its
crisp
light
and
hoppy
but
the
biggest
characteristic
is
the
cherry
sweet
smell
like
juice
but
it
isnt
a
dark
cherry
more
like
rainier
cherries
the
taste
is
pretty
simple
there
is
maltcherry
sweetness
and
the
other
taste
associated
with
cherries
a
tart
quality
its
a
very
accurate
and
rich
cherry
taste
like
cherry
pie
or
cherry
liquor
and
not
at
all
like
a
artificialcandied
flavor
extra
points
for
nailing
the
cherry
part
of
the
beer
although
the
beer
gets
sour
the
warmer
it
gets
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
smooth
enough
but
the
beer
really
is
as
light
as
it
looks
look
its
not
stellar
but
i
dont
know
why
so
many
are
hating
on
this
beer
its
not
like
they
gave
up
on
the
beer
aspects
and
just
went
for
gobs
of
cherry
o
if
i
had
no
taste
buds
this
would
be
a
wonderful
beer
great
smells
and
mouthfeel
to
it
but
i
cannot
get
over
that
medicinal
taste
take
a
halls
cherry
cough
drop
and
remove
the
menthol
part
of
it
and
you
come
out
with
this
beer
overall
an
alright
beer
not
something
that
id
seek
out
again
but
if
offered
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
o
good
beer
to
get
those
malt
drinkers
over
to
the
beer
side
yet
i
would
still
have
it
again
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
syrupy
and
medicinal
at
times
the
cherry
flavor
is
faint
and
overall
this
is
a
one
dimensional
easy
drinker
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
its
tough
to
make
a
good
fruit
wheat
beer
and
still
every
brewery
thinks
they
can
do
it
this
is
pretty
rough
stuff
and
lacks
the
balance
that
sam
adams
usually
gets
down
o
not
the
most
complex
of
beers
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
refreshing
and
enjoyable
would
drink
again
in
the
summer
overall
this
is
my
first
fruity
beer
that
ive
had
and
i
have
to
say
its
not
too
bad
seeing
previous
reviews
i
expected
this
to
taste
like
cough
syrup
like
i
had
previously
seen
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
quite
tame
compared
to
the
expectations
i
had
for
this
beer
but
in
a
goof
way
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
as
far
as
sams
offerings
most
if
not
all
are
fantastic
cranberry
lambic
is
by
far
their
worst
beer
but
the
cherry
comes
in
a
close
second
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
my
bestfriend
went
on
a
sam
adams
binge
and
bought
this
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
and
looked
like
your
average
beer
the
smell
was
very
nice
with
some
cherry
and
some
malt
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
rough
it
had
a
lot
of
cherry
and
just
seemed
like
cherry
soup
to
me
i
cant
think
of
anything
good
to
say
about
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
average
and
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
below
average
i
just
dont
know
what
to
say
overall
as
a
fruit
beer
this
is
a
c
as
a
wheat
beer
this
is
actually
a
b
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
fruit
beers
local
meijer
grocery
store
carrying
a
six
of
cherry
wheat
what
gots
to
try
that
the
appearance
is
a
clear
light
amber
with
reddish
hues
there
is
a
thin
white
head
with
little
foam
remains
with
active
bubbles
the
smell
is
a
robust
cherry
smell
that
is
fantastic
there
is
a
distinct
sammy
a
taste
to
every
beer
this
one
has
a
cherry
wheaty
malt
twang
the
mouthefeel
is
ok
i
think
more
than
one
is
tough
due
to
the
sweet
cherryiness
to
it
overall
good
beer
especially
for
the
summer
this
is
definitely
a
unique
flavor
that
seems
very
challenging
to
perfect
but
i
feel
like
a
small
downtone
of
the
cherry
would
make
it
almost
too
good
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
for
a
unique
taste
but
there
are
definitely
other
unique
brews
out
there
that
are
more
worth
your
try
it
wavers
kind
of
sickeningly
between
confection
and
medicine
after
a
few
too
many
sips
i
couldnt
finish
it
dr
average
abv
and
easy
drinkability
make
this
wellpriced
beer
one
to
try
but
its
lack
of
complexity
holds
it
back
when
i
saw
this
beer
i
had
to
try
it
i
drank
this
straight
from
the
bottle
but
did
check
its
color
which
was
a
light
red
the
smell
was
good
and
was
acually
the
best
part
about
this
beer
i
couldnt
stop
smelling
it
becuase
i
was
impressed
with
how
cherry
it
was
not
much
of
a
mouthfeel
a
little
watered
down
for
me
taste
was
great
at
first
because
cherrys
are
good
but
it
quicky
got
old
just
way
to
sweet
no
balance
at
all
after
taste
was
of
sweet
cherrys
would
have
liked
a
tart
cherry
after
taste
uh
im
drawing
a
blank
look
smell
taste
what
else
is
there
oh
right
mouthfeel
uh
feels
bubbly
and
full
of
flavors
in
my
mouth
o
not
impressed
maybe
i
let
this
bottle
sit
too
long
or
maybe
i
didnt
get
the
best
batch
either
way
either
way
this
is
a
brew
i
didnt
really
enjoy
the
flavors
are
nice
and
pronounced
and
the
cherries
do
an
adequate
job
as
a
hop
substitute
but
it
was
one
i
didnt
really
enjoy
the
flavors
were
rather
balanced
and
i
did
enjoy
the
aroma
but
all
in
all
this
was
a
pretty
average
beer
at
best
revisited
in
may
2014
pours
an
orangeamber
with
a
thin
wispy
white
head
smells
of
almond
paste
and
sweet
cherries
with
a
bit
of
crisp
lemony
wheat
in
the
background
tastes
sweet
and
quite
almondy
with
sweet
cherries
following
and
the
same
lemony
wheat
a
hot
of
sweet
cherry
liqueur
on
the
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
tartness
to
check
the
sweetness
but
no
denying
that
this
is
a
sweet
beer
i
like
this
a
bit
more
than
most
but
i
can
have
a
sweet
tooth
at
times
this
is
one
to
serve
to
friends
family
colleauges
strangers
o
im
surprised
this
ranked
so
low
i
thought
it
was
rather
enjoyable
and
refreshing
with
that
being
said
i
could
only
drink
this
once
in
a
while
but
it
was
nice
to
try
something
different
for
a
change
odecent
summer
refresher
that
is
easily
found
i
found
it
drinkable
enough
to
get
another
six
o
if
you
can
get
past
the
aftertaste
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
summer
day
i
found
it
pretty
refreshing
overall
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
because
i
like
a
good
sweet
fruit
beer
once
in
a
while
but
this
was
just
dry
astringent
and
kinda
weird
i
can
imagine
it
might
go
good
with
specific
food
pairings
but
doesnt
stand
on
its
own
as
a
straightforward
beer
overall
i
actually
kind
of
enjoyed
my
first
few
sips
but
the
taste
started
to
become
too
sweet
and
artificial
after
a
while
its
not
undrinkable
its
just
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
o
flavour
as
advertized
a
pleasant
summer
sipper
glad
i
came
across
this
by
chance
in
an
airport
lounge
odi
flat
out
do
not
like
this
beers
artificial
cloying
flavor
had
to
try
it
once
i
actually
think
i
may
regret
it
i
am
not
sure
if
i
have
said
that
before
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
gold
with
a
thin
crisp
head
leaving
spotty
lace
smell
has
a
dominant
maraschino
cherry
aroma
or
even
a
cherry
coke
taste
again
of
cherry
coke
or
cherry
cream
soda
with
wheat
as
the
backbone
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
brew
if
you
like
cherry
coke
pours
lightly
cloudy
and
has
a
sweet
and
tart
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruit
veggie
beers
that
is
not
overly
sweet
or
tart
this
beer
maintains
a
smoothness
and
has
a
slight
hop
flavor
but
definitly
will
not
give
you
a
great
name
for
having
street
cred
good
for
summer
activities
overall
this
beer
catches
a
lot
of
flak
but
to
me
its
a
reasonably
enjoyable
fruit
beer
maybe
im
biased
from
cherry
wheat
being
an
old
favorite
and
while
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
i
find
it
relatively
tasty
and
refreshing
a
decent
summer
brew
overall
good
beer
especially
for
the
summer
pours
a
clear
bronzed
yellow
with
a
finger
of
delicate
white
bubbles
for
a
head
which
dissipates
quickly
scent
of
bitterness
and
maraschino
cherries
wheat
and
more
cherries
in
the
taste
with
a
touch
of
honey
cherries
arent
too
overpowering
can
be
a
tad
harsh
and
acidic
but
overall
not
too
bad
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
o
i
had
this
beer
about
ten
years
ago
and
remember
not
liking
it
then
looks
like
my
tastes
havent
changed
o
this
served
as
a
gateway
craft
brew
for
me
a
few
years
ago
and
it
was
nice
to
revisit
dont
understand
why
so
many
hate
on
the
cherry
flavors
in
cherry
wheat
i
didnt
think
the
problem
is
authenticity
so
much
as
the
lack
of
balance
makes
the
cherries
overpowering
and
extractlike
average
beer
recommended
for
sessions
or
begginners
very
disappointed
with
boston
brewing
comp
mouthfeel
its
like
eating
jolly
ranchers
till
you
die
this
was
not
good
it
poured
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
smelled
vaguely
of
wheat
no
cherry
scent
it
tasted
manufactured
artificial
not
the
worst
i
have
had
but
this
one
needs
to
be
worked
on
mouthfeel
was
grainy
not
the
best
overall
one
should
expect
more
from
jim
othis
beer
has
good
color
and
aroma
but
lacks
the
impressionable
taste
and
feel
to
go
with
it
making
this
beer
good
if
you
liked
flavored
beers
but
nothing
special
to
try
if
you
dont
overall
drinkability
no
i
dont
see
myself
having
this
again
too
much
like
a
cherry
um
well
its
not
a
beer
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
exactly
it
sort
of
looks
like
one
but
doesnt
smell
taste
or
feel
like
one
a
weird
beer
and
im
not
sure
that
i
like
it
ill
stick
to
cherry
flavor
well
blended
into
a
belgian
or
into
a
cobbler
or
pie
not
as
this
beer
oh
well
not
everything
can
be
great
o
overall
i
am
no
longer
as
interested
in
this
beer
as
i
have
been
in
the
past
its
rather
light
and
the
flavor
slips
away
as
quickly
as
you
can
swallow
it
leaving
no
real
impressive
aftertaste
would
make
a
decent
session
ale
if
the
cherry
flavor
were
more
authentic
and
the
abv
went
down
one
point
as
it
is
it
can
be
enjoyed
in
multitude
on
a
hot
day
if
youre
not
overly
discerning
with
your
taste
and
you
have
a
decent
tolerance
a
little
too
cherry
and
quite
filtered
but
its
worth
a
shot
seriously
it
was
immensely
quafable
while
taking
a
hot
shower
d
well
it
tastes
like
cherry
but
it
thoroughly
proves
that
such
a
flavor
does
not
have
to
be
a
good
thing
it
seems
like
a
generic
american
wheat
beer
with
cough
syrup
added
for
depth
it
tastes
very
medicinal
and
the
phenolic
cherry
is
impossible
to
ignore
just
bad
i
cant
imagine
why
they
would
keep
brewing
this
really
o
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
or
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
i
have
not
had
many
cherry
wheats
and
do
not
really
know
how
to
compare
this
to
other
cherry
wheats
but
in
general
i
think
this
is
an
average
beer
aroma
is
full
of
cherries
but
not
medicinal
but
more
like
the
cherries
in
a
can
that
you
use
to
make
a
quick
cherry
pie
actually
this
is
just
like
a
cherry
coffee
cake
with
loads
of
vanilla
and
cake
aroma
taste
does
not
taste
very
wheatlike
light
pilslike
malts
and
slightly
tart
cherry
and
a
touch
of
pale
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
lightbodied
sweet
and
sour
on
the
palate
not
a
bad
sessionable
beer
but
too
heavy
in
cherry
the
cherry
wheat
is
exactly
what
it
is
advertized
as
a
beer
that
has
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
cherries
i
was
surprised
by
the
beer
however
i
am
not
a
fan
of
cherries
and
could
have
done
without
sampling
this
beer
i
would
recommended
the
beer
to
fans
of
cherries
hazy
straw
color
with
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
fast
sweet
aroma
of
cherry
purée
candied
syrup
and
subtle
wheat
tastes
of
unripe
cherries
wheat
subtle
light
fruit
juice
some
fruity
artificial
flavors
that
linger
on
the
palate
light
body
with
high
carbonation
focuses
on
cherries
but
without
a
solid
backbone
of
a
wheat
beer
tastes
artificial
and
cheap
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
its
a
nice
summer
beer
for
sure
smell
of
sweet
cherries
is
definitely
the
highlight
here
most
days
id
give
two
schlitz
for
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
o
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
me
wonder
how
many
people
actually
like
it
apparently
this
is
popular
among
college
girls
and
yuppies
well
then
its
got
a
right
to
exist
but
as
for
me
ive
definitely
had
better
fruit
wheat
beers
overall
probably
not
a
beer
i
will
be
revisiting
but
given
the
flavor
profile
im
sure
there
are
those
that
will
really
enjoy
it
i
always
get
giddy
when
i
see
these
hit
the
shelves
if
you
are
a
cherry
and
beer
lover
then
this
is
a
perfect
match
for
you
if
you
dont
like
cherries
then
dont
even
bother
with
this
plain
and
simple
this
beer
is
not
as
bad
as
people
are
making
it
out
to
be
ive
been
raggedon
recently
but
i
will
continue
to
forcepronounce
the
h
in
wheat
think
stewie
griffin
and
cool
whip
anyway
a
decided
miss
the
cherry
character
just
doesnt
work
at
all
nuff

its
not
a
good
beer
it
have
a
terrible
robitussin
taste
at
first
the
cherry
is
cherry
and
the
wheat
is
d
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
cherry
beer
this
is
a
once
in
awhile
specialty
though
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
day
though
because
they
are
just
so
overwhelmingly
cherry
and
your
taste
buds
just
get
overworked
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
theres
no
way
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
because
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
onedimensional
poured
amberorange
in
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
dissapated
rapidly
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
overwhelming
with
cherries
and
a
hint
of
sweet
yeast
it
tasted
sweet
with
a
very
strong
cherry
flavor
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
overall
nothing
special
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
unfortunately
this
wasnt
what
i
would
expect
for
a
cherry
wheat
maybe
just
a
hint
of
cherry
would
tone
it
down
and
bring
more
of
a
wheat
taste
overall
i
realize
that
fruit
beers
seem
to
be
a
very
polarizing
style
i
enjoy
them
but
not
with
a
flavor
this
overwhelming
i
could
barely
stomach
a
glass
but
if
you
prefer
a
fruit
beer
with
intense
in
your
face
flavor
this
may
be
right
up
your
alley
poured
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
amber
color
showing
obvious
signs
of
a
fruit
beer
sweet
smell
but
not
over
the
top
head
fizzles
down
quick
a
real
easy
drinking
beer
that
seems
to
lack
the
carbonation
of
most
beers
pretty
good
out
of
a
bottle
but
better
off
a
tap
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
well
with
a
salty
snack
wings
or
pizza
easy
to
drink
a
few
dtoo
one
diminesional
with
the
cherry
that
really
brings
it
down
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
and
i
usually
pick
up
a
case
of
these
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
dthis
is
very
drinkable
if
you
love
cherries
i
like
cheeries
but
dont
love
them
with
this
had
alittle
more
boozey
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
but
too
much
cheerieness
nice
drinking
beer
with
a
steak
on
the
grill
d
hmmm
again
at
first
it
was
very
enjoyable
but
there
is
definitely
something
in
the
aftertaste
i
am
not
ecstatic
about
good
i
think
but
not
something
id
go
after
again
or
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
d
drinkability
is
moderate
for
how
light
this
beer
is
it
is
actually
pretty
filling
and
it
took
me
a
while
to
finish
the
cherry
flavor
is
refreshing
at
the
start
but
turns
a
bit
for
the
worse
as
it
warms
it
is
probably
the
amount
of
cherry
wheat
flavoring
that
is
in
the
beer
if
it
was
a
bit
lighter
then
it
might
be
improved
despite
the
gripes
its
drinkable
enough
for
me
as
i
like
cherry
and
i
feel
like
the
cherry
here
is
naturaltasting
enough
its
the
other
traits
that
bother
me
this
really
drinks
more
like
a
soda
than
beer
overall
not
one
of
the
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
but
a
decent
beer
that
i
come
back
to
every
now
and
then
when
looking
for
a
fruity
beer
d
i
guess
i
wouldnt
be
pounding
down
a
12
pack
of
this
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
once
every
so
often
from
random
notes
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
golden
with
a
small
but
lasting
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
of
cherry
cough
syrup
and
light
notes
of
wheat
taste
is
the
same
as
aroma
medium
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
like
drinking
watered
down
cherry
cough
syrup
not
a
good
beer
for
me
this
was
my
last
cherry
wheat
left
and
probably
will
be
the
last
one
that
ill
have
for
quite
a
while
this
has
been
a
beer
that
i
have
almost
always
kept
on
hand
however
i
think
that
there
are
probably
better
options
out
there
while
i
wont
be
buying
anymore
in
the
near
future
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
one
up
if
it
were
available
if
that
cherry
type
of
smell
and
taste
is
your
thing
youll
love
this
beer
for
me
though
it
isnt
that
great
cause
i
prefer
real
fruit
taste
and
this
isnt
it
but
it
does
have
characteristics
of
a
solid
wheat
ale
almost
and
that
makes
it
at
least
drinkable
mouthfeel
sucks
just
like
being
forced
to
take
some
cough
syrup
you
scramble
for
a
cup
of
water
to
wash
your
mouth
out
i
hate
this
beer
i
dont
throw
around
the
work
hate
too
often
but
i
hate
this
beer
dont
ever
drink
this
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
fruit
beers
are
not
usually
my
thing
so
it
would
be
something
special
for
me
to
want
to
continue
drinking
one
i
am
not
sure
i
could
force
myself
to
drink
another
one
of
these
d
this
beer
is
a
little
more
off
putting
than
great
tasting
alcohol
in
this
is
more
than
enough
and
lingers
well
into
the
aftertaste
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
enjoy
but
the
alcohol
and
fake
cherry
taste
i
can
not
get
past
grade
ba
verdict
best
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
or
a
basket
of
cherries
i
suppose
nothing
subtle
about
this
beer
its
very
straightforward
what
you
see
on
the
label
is
what
you
get
in
the
taste
which
is
pretty
nice
if
you
enjoy
predictability
the
overall
super
sweet
taste
was
a
turn
away
for
me
in
addition
to
the
lack
of
any
complexities
that
might
distinguish
this
beer
from
cherry
cocacola
and
some
wheat
dont
get
me
wrong
definitely
worth
a
go
no
matter
who
you
are
in
the
beer
field
but
i
found
several
notable
flaws
that
will
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
return
to
this
beer
anytime
soon
c
2
85
this
is
a
beer
that
i
feel
is
below
me
but
it
really
is
good
sometimes
ill
tell
myself
this
beer
isnt
anything
special
but
it
kind
of
is
definitely
one
of
sam
adams
better
yearround
offerings
the
only
two
good
things
i
can
say
about
this
beer
are
that
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
wheat
in
it
and
it
has
a
decent
color
i
hate
beers
that
skimp
out
on
the
wheat
when
they
say
they
are
in
fact
wheat
beers
this
beer
does
not
skimp
out
but
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
the
taste
and
the
smell
are
just
bombarded
with
cherrys
the
taste
even
more
than
the
smell
its
almost
to
the
point
where
you
dont
want
to
drink
it
but
at
the
same
time
its
just
cherrys
so
it
isnt
that
horrible
it
just
didnt
really
taste
like
much
of
a
beer
more
like
a
cherry
soda
just
not
a
very
good
beet
in
my
book
honestly
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
basic
lager
with
cherry
juice
in
it
not
that
it
is
a
bad
thing
though
it
is
pretty
tasty
even
if
it
is
rather
simple
it
gets
my
stamp
of
approval
had
this
on
tap
at
the
newark
airport
waiting
for
my
flight
back
to
toronto
i
knew
this
didnt
have
the
best
ratings
but
the
other
selections
were
a
couple
other
sam
adams
plus
typical
macro
lagers
pours
a
pinkishorange
colour
with
thin
white
head
smells
of
very
sweet
artificial
cherry
similar
to
cherry
candy
some
faint
wheat
aroma
is
there
too
quite
a
sweet
flavour
medium
body
carbonation
easy
to
drink
beer
just
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
row
just
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
found
samuel
adams
cherry
wheat
tobe
a
versatile
beer
sweet
enough
to
function
as
a
dessert
beer
but
enough
of
all
the
the
other
things
that
make
a
wheat
beer
enjoyable
d
ok
but
too
sweet
in
the
smell
and
dont
like
the
metal
in
the
taste
also
way
too
carbonated
not
sam
adams
best
work
wouldnt
look
to
have
this
one
again
d
crisp
and
clean
a
great
combination
of
wheat
and
cherries
d
very
drinkable
and
lower
in
alcohol
not
a
goto
fruit
beer
but
drinkable
enough
pours
into
a
golden
body
with
a
whit
head
that
has
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
carbonation
is
decent
in
this
beer
the
smell
is
a
very
strong
cherry
flavor
along
with
some
wheat
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
strong
cherry
taste
that
stays
from
beginning
until
the
end
along
with
some
hints
of
wheat
yeast
hops
a
little
citrus
and
some
banana
at
the
end
it
has
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
little
stickiness
and
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
as
drinkable
as
id
like
it
to
be
since
it
is
a
beer
that
is
filling
compared
to
others
i
recently
tried
this
is
a
good
beer
to
check
out
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
cherry
flavored
brew
edit
ok
ive
had
the
second
bottle
at
proper
temp
only
a
marginal
difference
for
the
better
d
gets
to
be
too
sweet
towards
the
last
of
the
bottle
definitely
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
row
still
a
pretty
good
beer
though
d
the
drinkability
is
decent
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
if
i
wanted
a
cherry
beer
there
are
a
lot
of
better
ones
out
there
to
choose
from
worth
a
try
though
this
drinks
pretty
good
but
it
is
definatly
a
chick
beer
i
being
a
guy
still
very
much
so
enjoyed
this
i
dont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
but
when
its
offered
i
never
refuse
beautiful
amber
color
and
pours
well
not
quite
a
lambic
but
similar
easily
one
of
the
best
american
flavored
beers
ive
ever
had
sam
adams
comes
through
yet
again
without
a
doubt
boston
beer
co
is
the
best
american
brewery
drinkability
despite
the
cherry
flavor
its
easy
to
keep

not
much
else
going
on
here
overall
a
ok
and
refreshing
summer
beer
usually
sam

this
beer
would
be
better

medicine
drinkabilty
isnt

but
could
be
better
if

this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
almost
copper
color
the
moment
you
open
the
bottle
you
smell
cherries
the
beer
tastes
of
cherries
and
a
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
almost
medium
feel
to
it
i
would
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
almost
like
a

very

using

god
help
me
i
kind
of
like
this
i
consider
myself
a
purest
beer
should
taste
like
beer
and
any
added
flavors
dont
belong
but
this
is
kind
of
ok
smell
is
only
of
cherries
artificial
cherries
like
in
cherry
coke
i
like
the
smell
of
cherry
coke
cloudy
golden
color
like
a
typical
wheat
beer
about
one
inch
of
sticky
white
head
remains
after
pouring
the
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
fruity
sweet
a
little
tangy
definately
a
lot
of
vanilla
presance
cherry
vanilla
dr
pepper
with
the
typical
sour
twang
of
a
wheat
beer
the
sour
twang
was
actually
the
least
pleasant
part
i
like
cherry
vanilla
dr
pepper
but
im
not
sure
if
those
flavors
belong
in
a
beer
it
does
taste
good
so
how
wrong
can
it
be
this
is
way
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
this
is
a
once
every
six
months
change
of
pace
kind
of
beer
this
is
a
better
choice
than
smirnoff
ice
or
one
of
the
other
sweet
not
really
beer
concoctions
i
think
that
is
the
audiance
for
this
stuff
i
dont
see
myself
knockin
more
than
one
of
these
back
a
session
d
sadly
just
nothing
here
to
get
excited
about
not
even
a
session
type
beer
might
as
well
drink
tea
itd
be
stronger
just
toured
the
sa
brewery
in
jamaica
plain
glad
this
wasnt
one
of
the
brews
we
sampled
drinkability
i
could
down
a
few
if
i
had
a
set
of
boobs
but
that
is
not
the
case
overall
good
for
a
fruit
beer
cherry
is
not
overwhelming
and
the
wheat
comes
through
nicely
a
little
too
sweet
though
cheers
i
had
this
years
ago
and
didnt
care
much
for
it
to
include
this
in
the
sam
adams
harvest
seasonal
mixed
pack
seems
like
a
summer
afterthough
i
dont
associate
cherries
with
fall
really
and
this
isnt
thirst
quenching
enough
for
a
summer
offering
or
comforting
enough
for
a
fall
seasonal
d
better
than
cranberry
lambic
but
thats
not
saying
much
should
be
retired
from
the
sa
lineup
tastes
like
cherry
cough
drop
soda
md
a
bit
of
crispness
initially
from
the
carb
but
that
dies
as
this
warms
cherry
wheat
is
a
step
below
medium
bodied
with
a
o
k
feel
for
a
fruit
beer
i
expect
the
cherry
flavor
to
stay
with
me
for
a
bit
but
this
just
kind
of
vanishes
away
a
low
abv
and
a
decent
taste
make
this
good
for
two
bottles
i
would
not
go
farther
than
that
though
notes
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
out
of
the
bottle
ill
admit
though
that
ive
never
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
ive
learned
that
it
can
make
a
big
difference
once
the
flavors
are
allowed
to
develop
some
real
errors
appear
one
of
sam
adams
weaker
beers
for
sure
ill
still
have
this
occasionally
because
i
like
it
out
of
the
bottle
drinkability
this
is
really
a
type
of
beer
that
must
be
had
with
food
and
it
should
be
a
desert
even
with
that
said
i
found
it
hard
to
go
through
my
whole
pint
because
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
really
got
to
me
so
its
sort
of
good
for
novelty
sake
but
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
then
one
in
a
night
i
liked
this
one
it
was
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
not
the
overpowering
cherry
tart
i
was
expecting
i
pleasant
surprise
taste
is
smooth
and
easy
pleasant
cherry
taste
and
not
anywhere
near
as
sweet
as
it
smells
decent
malt
balance
a
touch
of
yeast
and
slightly
more
than
average
carbonation
make
this
a
genuine
entry
for
a
fruit
flavored
beer
instead
of
just
dumping
in
some
fruit
juice
at
the
end
and
calling
it
so
a
good
beer
to
have
with
dessert
and
a
fine
session
brew
for
the
fall
or
spring
first
impressions
are
good
cloudy
wheatgold
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
the
nose
is
a
little
offputting
wheat
with
a
strong
air
of
unpleasant
cherryrobitussin
scent
taste
is
initally
very
poor
like
a
bitter
cherry
pill
the
wheat
seems
to
become
a
little
more
evident
after
the
first
few
sips
but
its
still
nothing
special
the
beer
has
a
bitter
medicinal
aftertaste
that
lingers
after
each
sip
definitely
the
weak
link
in
the
sampler
pack
the
mouthfeels
is
alright
but
i
could
only
swallow
about
4
ounces
before
i
gave
the
rest
to
my
wife
she
liked
it
but
i
did
not
somewhat
syrupy
in
the
feel
and
oddly
filling
i
would
not
enjoy
following
this
up
with
another
i
remember
liking
this
beer
way
back
in
my
initial
foray
into
craft
say
12
yrs
ago
or
so
it
probably
has
not
changed
but
my
tastes
certainly
have
this
is
actually
a
very
goodlooking
beer
an
ordinary
hefeweizen
hazy
orange
with
a
slight
sunsetty
tinge
of
cherry
rouge
the
head
on
top
is
no
slouch
puffy
and
cumulous
and
white
with
fantastic
retention
the
aroma
smells
like
cherry
kringle
not
much
depth
but
it
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
tart
with
cherry
which
dominates
but
there
is
a
sort
of
wheaty
tang
and
some
bready
notes
underneath
plus
a
snap
of
hops
in
the
end
nice
mouthfeel
with
very
soft
carbonation
and
a
solid
dryness
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
this
beer
but
the
overall
impression
is
one
of
balance
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
the
cherry
flavor
is
fresh
and
robust
but
not
overwhelming
it
would
seem
at
first
that
as
similar
to
soda
as
this
beer
is
that
it
would
be
easy
to
slam
these
all
night
however
from
experience
i
can
tell
you
this
beer
loses
its
novelty
fairly
quickly
while
one
of
these
on
occassion
is
a
light
and
unchallenging
treat
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
session
proves
a
challenge
tastes
mostly
like
a
crisp
american
wheat
beer
with
a
healthy
dose
of
sweet
and
sour
cherry
flavor
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
maybe
even
leaning
towards
watery
but
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
not
sure
if
a
sixpack
purchase
is
in
my
near
future
but
ill
happily
drink
these
as
part
of
the
fall
sampler
pack
light
bodied
with
a
high
foaminyourmouth
level
of
carbonation
that
just
makes
it
harder
to
get
down
i
can
drink
this
single
bottle
i
have
unleashed
upon
the
world
but
thankfully
this
is
from
a
sampler
pack
and
my
brother
will
drink
the
other
one
of
sams
worst
drinkability
very
easy
to
consume
lawnmower
or
beach
bum
beer
i
e
great
for
the
summer
not
sure
why
its
in
the
fall
sampler
pack
im
generally
fine
with
most
of
the
sam
adams
products
especially
those
that
are
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
i
e
imperial
pilsner
however
their
cherry
wheat
misses
the
mark
the
look
is
fine
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
smell
is
not
so
great
maraschino
cherry
syrup
very
sweet
and
cloying
the
taste
is
not
so
cloying
but
still
nothing
good
too
sweet
when
there
should
be
some
tartness
mouthfeel
is
like
soda
bordering
on
harsh
yeah
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
could
see
people
enjoying
this
one
its
like
beer
but
not
recommendation
to
avoid
picked
up
the
sam
adams
fall
sampler
to
try
some
more
from
their
vast
line
of
products
the
cherry
wheat
follows
the
other
fruitinfused
wheats
theyve
put
out
over
the
years
but
tastes
more
artificial
than
the
others
not
too
good
d
the
cherry
taste
on
the
palate
is
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
isnt
comparably
good
the
strange
yeasty
malts
will
probably
be
the
factor
that
deters
me
from
having
another
one
of
the
first
samuel
adams
beers
i
ever
tried
it
did
not
fail
to
impress
as
most
sam
adams
would
from
then
on
an
unusual
idea
for
beer
i
would
think
cherries
amongst
a
wheat
beer
proved
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
from
the
aroma
to
the
exceptional
taste
right
down
to
the
craving
of
the
next
sip
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
is
always
a
recommendation
i
make
when
people
are
looking
to
dabble
into
new
beers
overall
i
dont
think
its
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
great
its
easy
enough
to
drink
one
but
i
think
a
second
might
be
overkill
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
every
once
in
a
while
though
d
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
very
well
thought
out
and
use
of
fruit
and
malt
based
on
style
this
may
be
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
i
love
sam
adams
so
i
hate
to
rag
however
i
still
regret
this
beer
to
each
his
own
d
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
people
make
it
out
to
be
the
cherries
give
it
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
but
a
decent
beer
i
dont
really
know
why
anyone
would
drink
more
than
one
of
these
sure
it
smells
great
but
the
taste
certainly
disappoints
a
sweetsmelling
brew
but
terribly
unbalanced
tastewise
youd
be
better
off
with
a
kriek
if
you
want
some
cherry
in
your
beer
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
cherry
beer
but
i
picked
the
wrong
one
with
this
offering
i
love
cherries
and
have
brewed
with
them
myself
on
occasion
this
is
not
a
good
cherry
beer
by
any
measurement
drinkability
really
good
exceptional
cherry
flavor
will
drink
again
my
girlfriend
couldnt
really
handle
it
so
she
gave
me
hers
which
i
certainly
did
not
refuse
jonathan
passow
pours
with
a
fluffy
12
inch
head
lots
of
lacing
moderately
strong
aroma
of
cherries
in
the
nose
taste
is
crisp
with
an
upfront
tartness
from
the
cherries
the
cherry
flavor
dominates
the
taste
but
the
malt
makes
it
presence
known
on
the
back
of
the
initial
cherry
flavor
more
tart
than
sweet
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
could
only
drink
one
or
two
of
these
before
moving
on
to
something
else
d
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
aroma
but
otherwise
this
is
a
fairlyenjoyable
beer
that
would
be
even
better
on
a
hot
day
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
as
the
sweetness
may
become
too
much
if
you
are
offered
a
sip
of
this
beer
for
free
take
it
other
than
that
dont
bother
unless
you
are
trying
to
turn
a
bad
day
worse
not
a
bad
beer
actually
i
was
expecting
the
worse
the
cherries
are
nice
producing
a
decent
flavor
although
kind
of
artificial
without
bringing
any
sweetness
i
think
the
wheat
complemented
nicely
my
only
gripes
being
the
taste
fell
pretty
flat
compared
to
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
not
a
bad
effort
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
few
fruit
beers
ive
liked
mouthfeel
is
a
thinner
than
i
remember
and
with
a
lightly
grassy
bitter
finish
that
gets
a
little
sticky
this
is
the
low
point
of
cherry
wheat
for
me
if
it
wasnt
for
that
bitter
finish
id
consider
cherry
wheat
very
drinkable
ill
try
a
black
and
tan
with
the
remaining
cherry
wheat
in
the
mix
pack
but
if
its
anything
like
the
bt
i
tried
with
cranberry
lambic
this
will
be
another
sa
mix
pack
beer
to
feed
my
drain
drinkability
not
necessarily
bad
but
it
is
a
bit
weird
i
would
recommend
it
because
its
different
and
worth
a
taste
but
this
isnt
something
i
would
get
excited
about
drinking
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
that
good
either
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
drinkability
one
of
my
least
favorite
sam
adams
but
i
can
have
one
once
in
a
while
but
too
sweet
for
my
palate
one
is
fine
but
any
more
would
be
overkill
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
and
artificial
to
be
truly
drinkable
if
real
michigan
cherries
were
used
why
does
it
remind
me
of
maraschinos
not
really
bad
but
not
interested
in
having
it
again
sam
adams
worst
beer
although
i
never
tried
the
infamous
triple
bock
good
beer
for
a
really
hot
day
taste
the
carbonation
seems
slightly
high
especially
in
a
wheat
but
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
with
only
a
slight
cherry
taste
drinkability
it
doesnt
really
wear
on
you
so
id
imagine
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
casual
drinking
i
liked
it
and
i
could
drink
it
again
but
i
also
wasnt
wowed
by
it
im
not
sure
i
would
like
to
drink
many
of
these
beers
not
that
it
is
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
either
love
or
dont
care
for
its
the
latter
for
me
im
afraid
i
had
a
six
pack
of
this
wheat
beer
it
does
have
a
rather
sweet
aroma
though
it
smells
like
cherry
candy
very
artificial
this
beer
is
slightly
cloudy
much
like
you
would
find
in
average
wheat
ales
the
flavor
is
a
change
from
the
norm
and
in
hot
weather
can
prove
to
be
quite
refreshing
just
be
sure
to
keep
you
other
favorites
nearby
as
this
one
has
a
bitter
cherry
aftertaste
like
you
would
find
in
cough
drops
the
palate
leaves
much
to
be
desired
just
serve
this
one
cold
to
avoid
complications
overall
this
beer
is
an
ok
beer
that
is
best
served
cold
and
consumed
rather
quickly
just
remember
this
is
a
wheat
beer
and
can
be
quite
filling
as
well
ontap
at
mr
goodbars
synthetic
tasting
cherry
aroma
and
taste
grapefruit
body
and
a
bit
of
soapy
head
some
lace
looks
ok
average
mouthfeel
nothing
special
to
drink
or
taste
after
some
cherry
lambics
and
wild
yeasts
recently
this
didnt
cut
it
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
this
is
a
beer
that
gives
you
exactly
what
is
advertised
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinkability
make
this
one
a
solid
choice
for
the
hotter
months
a
good
beer
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
but
not
something
that
i
would
keep
stocked
in
the
fridge
d
the
more
i
sip
at
this
the
less
i
want
to
drink
it
its
aroma
caught
me
right
away
followed
by
the
appearance
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
began
turning
me
off
quickly
not
something
id
want
more
than
one
of
and
definitely
one
of
samuel
adams
weaker
offerings
drinkability
i
personally
couldnt
handle
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
just
because
of
the
sweetness
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
though
this
seems
to
be
an
agreeable
light
peppy
beer
to
usher
in
spring
drinkability
i
tried
to
be
as
objective
with
this
beer
as
possible
if
you
like
the
taste
of
cherries
you
will
like
this
beer
if
you
dont
then
you
wont
like
this
beer
i
belong
to
the
latter
and
therefore
did
not
care
for
this
one
d
this
stuff
is
just
plain
refreshing
and
strikes
a
great
balance
between
sweet
and
dry
if
you
like
cherries
or
cherry
flavor
youll
love
this
some
of
the
reviews
i
have
read
seem
a
bit
harsh
and
i
sense
that
maybe
these
folks
may
not
particularly
care
for
cherry
flavor
i
have
been
a
fan
of
this
stuff
since
it
came
out
many
years
ago
and
have
had
it
on
tap
as
well
most
of
the
time
it
is
great
but
there
is
some
inconsistency
with
batches
so
if
you
get
a
bad
six
pack
or
draught
definitely
try
another
single
or
on
tap
i
can
say
that
this
particular
bottle
even
though
it
is
over
a
month
out
of
date
is
still
excellent
as
a
plus
i
believe
it
is
now
bottle
conditioned
for
longer
shelf
life
app
is
hazy
gold
amber
with
slight
foam
head
and
clearer
near
the
bottom
when
shone
in
the
light
red
can
be
seen
kind
of
cool
smells
bad
though
like
nothing
but
cherry
cough
syrup
and
carbonation
taste
is
similarly
terrible
strong
cherry
medicine
like
from
begginning
most
of
the
way
through
although
the
end
is
very
wheat
like
and
gives
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
still
this
is
a
hard
drinker
for
me
but
then
again
i
dont
like
cherries
so
what
do
you
expect
very
drinkable
and
i
recommend
you
follow
your
instincts
to
finish
it
quickly
unlike
many
beers
this
gets
worse
as
it
warms
maybe
if
i
was
on
a
desert
island
and
had
nothing
else
to
drink
if
that
was
the
case
id
want
a
pistol
and
one
bullet
d
this
is
a
decent
summer
time
beer
if
you
can
stand
the
flavor
best
served
very
cold
in
my
opinion
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
ripe
cherries
almost
artificial
like
cherry
ice
cream
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
slightly
tart
cherry
with
crisp
dry
wheat
flavor
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
sharp
tart
flavor
from
the
wheat
this
is
an
alright
fruit
beer
but
the
cherry
flavor
does
not
meld
well
to
me
d
average
fairly
easy
drinker
if
you
can
get
past
the
taste
the
foam
was
light
wheat
in
color
smooth
thick
and
lacey
the
color
was
orange
golden
amber
with
dark
honey
highlights
the
smell
had
a
extremely
potent
cherry
pit
overtone
with
hints
of
wheat
the
taste
was
the
mirror
image
of
the
smell
mouthfeel
light
mediumbodied
with
a
semiviscous
feel
drinkability
there
is
a
very
dominate
and
powerfull
bitter
cherry
characteristic
that
hides
the
wheat
taste
ok
session
drinking
the
beer
after
smelling
is
definitely
a
let
down
in
the
nose
there
was
nothing
but
cherry
now
on
tasting
its
mostly
your
standard
american
wheat
ale
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
bitterness
mixing
with
the
cherries
and
finishing
with
a
slightly
bitter
cherry
aftertaste
while
the
cherry
may
not
carry
through
as
advertised
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
a
let
down
on
the
promise
of
cherry
and
wheat
its
taste
very
much
like
cherries
i
like
having
this
beer
as
a
chaser
after
something
strong
but
its
not
great
after
food
d
refreshing
not
overy
sweet
and
a
different
class
of
fruit
beer
from
other
brands
a
very
guilty
pleasure
body
approaches
medium
carbonation
is
light
fine
feels
creamy
without
being
heavy
its
easy
enough
to
drink
i
just
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
this
again
d
a
bit
of
a
misfire
from
bbc
theres
hardly
any
wheat
characteristics
at
all
the
cherries
take
over
everything
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
head
it
is
golden
and
clear
it
smells
like
maricino
cherries
it
has
a
sweet
cherry
taste
with
a
solid
wheat
backbone
it
is
a
great
beer
for
enjoying
after
a
day
of
weeding
the
garden
it
really
hits
the
spot
wow
the
cherry
element
in
this
beer
is
done
very
well
im
normally
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
the
wheat
portion
is
so
nicely
blended
it
makes
it
almost
like
a
cherry
sprite
very
easy
to
drink
almost
dangerously
easy
on
tap
at
the
coolidge
corner
clubhouse
ordered
one
because
i
havent
had
one
in
years
not
much
head
on
the
pint
glass
hazy
yellow
color
with
medium
carbonation
smells
sugary
and
tart
the
flavor
is
way
too
overpowering
its
like
drinking
cherry
juice
right
out
of
a
can
doesnt
taste
like
beer
at
all
really
more
like
a
cider
or
fruit
juice
no
wheat
beer
characteristics
noticed
very
sticky
on
the
palate
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
one
of
these
when
it
first
hit
the
market
my
preferences
have
definitely
changed
since
then
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
pint
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
found
this
to
be
surprisingly
good
had
a
golden
color
with
just
a
tinge
of
red
to
it
the
aroma
definitely
announced
that
cherry
was
present
the
taste
is
not
sweet
you
get
the
cherry
with
a
slight
tartness
and
the
wheat
flavors
come
across
as
well
one
doesnt
overwhelm
the
other
it
was
very
crisp
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
cherry
isnt
as
cloying
as
i
thought
itd
be
d
one
is
enough
for
me
appearance
cloudy
light
straw
copper
smell
is
a
burst
of
cherry
maybee
a
hint
of
wheat
but
the
cherry
dominates
taste
is
an
immediate
burst
of
cherry
followed
by
a
wheaty
finish
there
is
a
decent
head
with
lacing
the
beer
is
thick
and
would
be
ideal
for
an
after
dinner
drink
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
is
great
twist
to
a
fruitvegie
drink
this
beer
pours
a
ever
so
slightly
hazy
goldorangish
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
left
on
top
decent
head
retention
and
wispy
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
cherries
cherries
cherries
maracchino
cherries
and
just
a
touch
of
a
malt
backbone
to
it
taste
is
overwhelmingly
cherry
i
am
definitely
a
fan
of
fruity
beer
but
the
cherry
flavoring
dominates
the
taste
to
a
point
of
distraction
perhaps
because
it
almost
an
artificial
cherry
taste
there
are
slight
notes
of
malts
in
this
beer
but
not
enough
to
even
remotely
balance
out
the
cherry
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
medium
to
high
carbonation
that
works
well
for
this
beer
slightly
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
to
it
many
years
ago
i
had
tried
this
beer
and
loved
it
oh
how
the
palate
changes
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
have
one
of
anything
more
would
be
far
too
sweet
cloudy
copper
color
light
prickle
with
a
wispy
head
cherry
and
grain
on
the
nose
the
cherry
smell
is
reminiscent
of
cherry
skoal
smokeless
tobacco
the
attack
is
mild
and
clean
faint
hints
of
cherry
and
grain
in
the
flavor
relatively
clean
finish
with
just
a
little
bite
of
wheat
the
aftertaste
is
definitely
cherry
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
my
wife
says
that
it
tastes
like
smith
bros
cherry
throat
lozenges
my
drain
was
able
to
chug
this
beer
easily
but
i
could
not
get
through
more
than
half
of
the
pint
one
of
the
few
big
stinkers
from
boston
beer
company
drinkability
unless
you
have
fond
memories
of
your
parents
giving
you
cough
syrup
when
you
were
a
child
this
isnt
for
you
some
actual
cherry
flavoring
would
have
helped
but
this
one
was
not
that
pass
im
glad
i
have
a
store
where
i
can
make
my
own
six
packs
i
cant
imagine
dealing
with
5
more
of
these
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
am
trying
to
get
rid
of
it
i
can
barely
drink
two
of
these
at
a
time
without
getting
a
sickly
taste
in
my
mouth
as
stated
they
remind
me
of
ludens
cough
drops
which
probably
does
not
invoke
the
most
pleasant
memories
hence
my
not
liking
this
beer
i
am
very
disappointed
because
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
some
of
my
best
childhood
memories
were
spent
in
michigan
so
when
i
saw
they
were
made
with
michigan
cherries
i
was
genuinely
excited
to
try
this
beer
too
bad
it
is
not
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
oh
well
i
guess
i
just
have
to
wait
for
fallwinter
when
my
favorite
sam
adam
seasonals
come
out
drinkability
not
my
favorite
a
fairly
weak
offering
in
my
opinion
1x
final
thoughts
i
would
only
drink
this
on
one
of
three
occations
if
i
was
ordering
a
summer
salad
if
i
was
a
non
beer
drinker
and
or
if
i
was
a
first
time
beer
drinker
not
to
bad
pours
hazy
golden
with
white
head
nose
is
full
of
artificial
cherry
flavoring
not
assuming
it
wasnt
real
cherries
added
palate
is
lightly
sour
with
big
cherry
flavors
not
lambic
levels
though
and
a
soft
malty
component
towards
the
end
easy
to
drink
good
for
a
gateway
beer
and
women
d
i
was
ready
after
smelling
the
beer
but
the
taste
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
like
sam
adams
just
not
their
fruit
beers
md
mouthfeel
is
soft
but
also
very
sweet
in
flavor
that
makes
you
kind
of
smack
your
lips
to
bare
it
drinkablity
is
alright
if
you
like
a
fruity
beer
to
sip
on
d
it
was
the
longest
six
apck
ever
i
would
say
try
it
you
might
like
it
i
didnt
drinkability
personally
i
would
say
there
are
many
far
more
engaging
fruitbased
beers
to
be
had
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
cherries
and
are
looking
for
light
easygoing
refreshment
with
a
slight
alcoholic
kick
then
this
may
be
the
way
to
go
its
another
great
brew
from
samuel
adams
samuel
adams
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
company
the
beer
is
great
in
a
bottle
and
its
even
better
on
tap
when
i
first
started
drinking
this
i
thought
it
would
be
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
bottles
however
the
sweetness
doesnt
seem
to
carry
the
weight
that
other
fruit
flavored
drinks
do
d
i
thought
that
it
would
be
too
sweet
to
finish
when
i
started
but
the
sweetness
seemed
to
mellow
out
a
little
bit
somewhat
refreshing
on
a
warmer
day
drinkability
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
figure
out
why
i
like
this
beer
the
best
part
about
it
is
the
fact
that
i
want
to
drink
more
chalk
this
one
up
too
the
twilight
zone
overall
there
are
just
way
too
many
cherries
in
this
beer
if
they
toned
it
down
a
bit
i
would
be
able
to
have
another
but
not
at
this
rate
this
could
maybe
be
an
alright
summer
beer
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
can
say
im
definitely
not
one
of
them
it
pours
very
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
i
can
smell
a
bit
of
wheat
but
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
thick
cherry
scent
almost
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
up
front
chery
flavor
dominating
every
sip
for
people
who
love
a
lot
of
fruit
flavor
in
their
beers
this
would
be
perfect
after
one
of
these
i
did
not
want
another
certainly
not
the
best
wheat
beer
out
there
but
its
got
a
lot
of
good
things
going
for
it
yellow
but
not
a
corn
yellow
more
the
color
of
sand
on
a
summer
day
on
the
northeast
coast
not
much
head
retention
and
a
definite
chill
haze
smells
like
cherry
cough
drops
and
wheat
nice
tastes
a
lot
different
than
a
lot
of
other
wheat
beers
it
has
very
up
front
tastes
of
fruit
but
its
not
exclusively
cherry
i
really
do
enjoy
the
way
it
lacks
dryness
and
instead
provides
an
single
intent
this
beer
wanted
to
be
cherry
and
it
most
certainly
is
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
and
feel
i
spent
my
hard
earned
money
on
a
respectable
brew
d
i
would
say
this
is
definitely
an
after
dinner
beer
it
is
so
sweet
you
could
serve
it
with
some
waffle
cones
or
honey
graham
crackers
and
it
would
actually
go
rather
well
other
than
that
i
dont
know
what
it
would
go
with
the
cherry
is
so
overpowering
that
it
does
mask
the
grain
and
hops
to
a
great
degree
serve
to
someone
interested
in
changing
up
from
wine
coolers
or
cocktails
who
is
not
familiar
with
good
brew
this
is
not
a
bad
change
of
pace
beer
i
could
have
two
in
a
sitting
but
i
dont
think
id
go
for
more
than
that
its
got
a
niche
im
sure
being
affordable
and
probably
a
tasty
alternative
for
girls
and
bmc
drinkers
starts
to
get
tiresome
rather
quick
unfortunately
maybe
as
a
result
of
being
too
flavorful
especially
compared
to
wheats
like
312
or
blue
moon
it
easily
could
have
had
half
as
much
cherry
flavor
and
it
still
would
have
been
plenty
65
recommended
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
it
is
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
cherries
for
me
because
they
dont
feel
well
balanced
with
the
actual
beer
worth
a
try
but
i
will
probably
not
seek
it
out
fantastic
it
looks
great
when
you
pour
it
out
when
you
give
it
a
whiff
you
get
a
burst
of
wonderful
cherry
aroma
then
when
you
take
your
first
sip
you
get
that
same
burst
of
cherry
flavor
that
you
expected
as
soon
as
you
smelled
it
then
you
get
a
wonderful
light
crisp
beer
flavor
that
complements
the
cherry
flavor
fantastically
i
could
pound
these
all
day
long
i
am
no
expert
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
this
beer
is
definitely
not
what
i
like
in
appearance
it
is
good
nice
cherry
red
and
oakish
brown
blendbut
beer
is
meant
to
be
imbibednot
merely
seen
it
starts
with
the
aroma
it
smells
and
tastes
like
the
cherry
cough
syrup
my
mother
used
to
make
me
drink
this
beer
is
so
repulsive
i
am
shocked
that
a
major
brewing
company
like
sam
adamswhich
has
other
beers
i
do
like
could
put
something
so
horrible
into
the
market
i
had
to
ask
my
waitress
for
a
different
beer
as
i
could
not
actually
finish
this
beer
i
was
thinking
maybe
the
bar
i
was
at
stone
face
tavern
abq
nm
had
served
me
yet
another
stale
or
spoiled
beer
unfortunately
a
common
problem
with
beers
on
tap
in
albuquerque
bars
but
then
i
read
a
review
from
another
guy
on
ba
who
said
the
same
thing
maybe
i
am
breaking
the
rule
of
being
constructive
but
im
sorry
there
is
no
saving
this
beer
or
considering
what
the
brew
master
was
going
forthis
beer
is
nasty
i
like
cherries
and
i
like
beer
but
i
would
sooner
drink
pond
scum
than
another
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
dotson
overall
decent
beer
not
a
bad
idea
to
give
it
a
shot
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
especially
if
it
was
on
tap
somewhere
i
bet
it
would
be
better
that
way
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
samuel
adams
beers
i
can
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
short
order
very
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
however
a
delicious
session
beer
for
a
hot
spring
day
very
drinkable
with
a
little
bit
of
taste
to
keep
it
different
d
no
more
than
2
with
an
after
diner
drink
can
over
power
what
meal
you
have
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
decent
head
that
retains
a
very
nice
lace
nose
is
heavy
cherry
aroma
with
little
wheat
taste
is
crisp
and
dry
with
some
cherry
flavor
and
bitterness
refreshing
but
not
what
to
get
when
looking
for
a
beer
worth
a
try
though
verdict
as
wrong
as
it
seems
there
is
something
pleasant
about
the
cherry
flavor
however
it
still
seems
much
better
suited
to
the
candy
world
than
the
beer
world
this
is
a
very
strange
beer
and
i
find
it
hard
to
rate
all
i
can
really
say
is
that
while
i
certainly
dont
love
it
i
dont
absolutely
hate
it
either
i
suppose
that
makes
it
average
a
solid
selection
much
better
than
the
cranberry
lambic
beer
has
a
cherry
flavor
with
still
maintaining
the
characteristics
of
beer
beer
is
very
light
and
can
hold
its
own
vs
many
wheat
beers
without
added
flavoring
the
color
is
rich
the
aroma
isnt
that
great
but
is
still
solid
drinkability
i
find
the
first
and
second
glasses
to
be
sufficient
for
myself
because
the
cherry
does
become
overwhelming
as
you
drink
more
and
more
of
it
went
extremely
well
with
the
burger
and
fries
i
had
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
low
carbonation
its
thin
but
not
so
thin
as
to
seem
watery
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
color
the
head
is
half
and
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cherry
cough
drops
and
nothing
else
the
taste
is
a
little
more
beery
but
it
is
still
dominated
by
cherry
cough
drops
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
too
much
like
medicine
for
me
too
like
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
thins
again
sampled
on
feb

2009
on
tap
at
a
ruby
tuesday
restaurant
it
pours
a
bubbly
paleyellow
with
a
small
amount
of
offwhite
head
the
carbonation
is
constant
any
evidence
of
malts
or
hops
are
immediately
drowned
out
by
the
ovepowering
cherry
and
fruity
scents
its
just
way
too
much
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
texture
the
flavor
is
like
cherry
koolaid
but
more
sour
or
tart
i
think
i
caught
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
but
it
is
really
indistinguishable
from
that
cherry
taste
subtlety
would
have
been
the
better
route
for
this
brew
not
all
that
great
d
i
will
be
sure
to
purchase
a
larger
quantity
of
this
whenever
i
get
the
chance
i
would
love
to
enjoy
this
over
an
evening
with
friends
and
can
foresee
some
good
times
ahead
with
this
one
great
patio
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
one
for
a
beginner
or
for
veterans
who
like
something
different
now
and
again
d
great
drinkability
especially
of
this
taste
is
what
you
are
looking
for
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
not
a
stand
out
wow
beer
but
nice
and
easy
to
drink
with
some
high
points
notes
better
than
the
cranberry
lambic
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
extra
again
a
very
strong
cherry
when
they
call
it
cherry
wheat
they
where
not
kidding
but
i
liked
it
the
abundance
of
cherry
made
for
an
easy
quencher
tried
this
today
for
the
first
time
and
was
really
actually
impressed
it
was
incredible
delicious
and
drinkable
with
a
good
cherry
flavor
but
not
grossly
over
powering
it
was
just
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
only
had
half
of
one
but
def
wanted
more
then
that
the
smell
was
well
lived
up
to
in
the
yummy
cherry
tasty
a
good
beer
which
was
and
impressive
brew
in
the
sam
adams
line
of
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
is
good
for
when
you
need
something
really
light
but
still
want
to
drink
a
beer
not
a
bad
beer
for
clearing
the
taste
buds
in
between
imperial
porters
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
with
low
taste
bud
drinkers
would
probably
approve
not
a
great
beer
advocate
beer
though
overall
smells
amazing
but
doesnt
follow
up
on
the
taste
its
not
very
well
carbonated
but
is
still
very
drinkable
id
say
try
a
bottle
if
you
get
it
cheap
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
drinkiability
is
moderate
to
average
not
an
everyday
beer
but
when
the
occassion
calls
for
it
its
a
dessert
beer
drinkability
is
moderate
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
one
inch
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
strongly
of
cherry
flavoring
reminiscent
of
cough
syrup
fits
the
style
unfortunately
there
is
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
unlike
a
thick
syrup
average
carbonation
levels
there
is
a
cherry
syrup
flavoring
that
is
very
strong
designated
as
a
desert
beer
and
that
is
the
only
way
i
could
drink
another
one
of
these
there
is
an
associated
tartness
that
makes
is
hard
to
drink
overall
not
that
great
of
a
combination
cherry
beer
drinkability
sourness
prevents
it
from
being
a
sessions
beer
for
me
but
a
nice
sour
beer
d
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
in
bottles
but
never
on
tap
let
me
tell
you
its
a
whole
new
beer
in
bottle
form
i
can
do
one
or
two
on
tap
i
could
drink
all
day
this
beer
proves
why
draght
is
better
bottle
pour
into
stella
glass
pours
a
reddish
orange
with
medium
white
head
definite
aroma
of
cherry
not
as
much
in
the
flavor
malt
yeast
slight
wheat
lacing
is
okay
better
initial
flavor
less
at
finish
somewhat
dry
finish
and
less
distinct
flavoring
i
do
not
enjoy
the
aroma
there
is
definitely
a
strong
cherry
flavored
medicine
smell
going
on
for
me
i
would
not
purchase
again
the
rating
is
given
within
its
fruit
beer
category
basically
a
lawn
mower
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
crisp
and
refreshing
but
really
no
point
in
drinking
in
any
other
situation
really
not
that
bad
but
it
still
feels
like
a
beer
intended
for
people
who
dont
normally
drink
beer
this
underwhelms
a
little
not
a
strong
wheat
flavor
and
not
a
strong
cherry
despite
what
the
name
might
imply
however
it
does
have
a
nice
nose
and
decent
appearance
and
taste
is
certainly
not
bad
just
not
the
flavor
you
would
expect
given
the
nose
good
drinkability
overall
a
decent
quaff
this
really
is
not
even
a
style
of
beer
in
general
that
i
would
normally
purchase
myself
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
i
think
i
would
only
recommend
it
to
novices
who
tend
towards
sweeter
beers
though
drinkability
is
low
i
drank
three
of
these
in
a
row
and
felt
sorta
sick
from
all
the
sweetness
by
the
end
an
alright
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
d
if
you
like
sweet
fruity
drinks
then
this
beer
is
for
you
but
one
is
all
i
can
try
it
is
too
sweet
for
me

drinkability
is
good
if
you
arent
craving
hops
would
be
a
good
desert
beer
i
ended
up
drinking
all
of
the
cherry
wheats
in
the
box
one
per
session
drinkability
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
nor
my
favorite
fruit
finishing
the
glass
says
something
d
light
and
smooth
but
the
fullness
makes
it
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
night
would
be
good
for
a
nightcap
or
just
to
lounge
around
reason
for
the
3
5
is
because
this
beer
is
filling
which
is
to
be
expected
from
a
wheat
beer
try
it
cherry
drowns
everything
else
out
cherry
aroma
cherry
taste
pours
golden
small
white
head
little
lacing
some
malt
in
there
traces
of
wheat
all
in
all
a
little
too
fruity
for
me
im
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
fan
to
begin
with
this
was
a
little
much
for
me
probably
enjoyable
if
its
your
thing
but
it
was
a
little
too
fruity
and
not
nearly
beery
enough
for
my
tastes
somebody
else
mentioned
that
this
fits
well
in
a
samuel
adams
variety
pack
id
agree
with
that
i
loved
this
stuff
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beerbut
now
i
pass
on
it
if
possiblejust
too
sweeet
for
me
now
i
think
love
most
of
sams
other
stuff
though
poured
in
a
wheat
glass
it
is
a
reddish
orange
color
that
is
cloudy
a
very
strong
cherry
smell
with
hints
of
wheat
and
orange
through
the
drink
you
can
taste
cherries
and
the
wheat
is
just
a
second
thought
too
much
cherry
flavor
not
enough
malt
and
wheat
to
balanced
this
beer
out
it
was
just
an
okay
beer
ewwuu
after
i
took
only
a
few
sips
i
passed
this
beverage
around
to
all
my
friends
ranting
on
how
great
this
beer
tasted
i
couldnt
believe
how
strong
the
cherry
taste
was
my
only
issue
with
this
beer
is
i
only
had
two
but
couldnt
imagine
trying
to
put
down
a
whole
six
pack
of
these
in
one
sitting
drinkability
it
couldnt
be
anymore
drinkable
than
this
beer
very
refreshing
crisp
and
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
this
a
great
summertime
beer
d
this
is
another
samuel
adams
that
does
what
it
is
meant
to
do
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
nothing
awe
inspiring
with
the
taste
but
a
good
easy
drinkable
wheat
beer
pours
a
light
browntan
colored
body
with
a
very
big
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
has
a
strong
aroma
of
slightly
sour
cherries
some
maltiness
too
very
lively
palate
an
aftertaste
of
cherries
some
wheat
taste
malts
moderately
heavy
body
nice
tasty
brew
one
of
the
gateway
beers
for
me
rich
mouthfeel
with
complex
overtones
tastes
like
beer
at
first
but
then
it
hits
you
cherry
fake
cherry
why
do
they
add
the
superfake
flavor
okay
bs
this
stuff
is
cough
syrup
dont
bother
the
only
person
i
have
known
who
really
liked
this
stuff
was
my
last
boss
lets
leave
it
at
that
nikki
before
trying
this
particular
brew
from
sam
adams
i
had
never
tried
anything
cherrybased
in
flavor
this
beer
has
an
incredible
aroma
which
instantly
brings
to
mind
cherries
and
a
golden
body
its
certainly
worth
trying
however
the
cherry
flavor
was
complimented
by
only
a
slight
amount
of
malts
therefore
it
was
incredibly
sweet
and
taste
like
a
juice
more
than
anything
else
nevertheless
still
a
decent
and
interesting
beer
this
wheat
beer
is
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
on
a
regular
occasion
would
have
like
to
taste
more
malts
it
was
too
light
almost
lighter
than
a
light
beer
very
watery
could
drink
many
at
a
time
but
i
dont
really
have
a
reason
to
as
the
flavors
werent
very
good
d
i
suppose
this
would
at
least
make
a
good
session
beer
but
only
if
you
werent
worried
too
much
with
taste
smell
on
this
wheat
is
the
best
thing
it
has
going
for
it
average
definitely
drinkable
because
its
so
easy
going
down
but
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
after
the
first
or
second
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
mind
if
this
beer
spilled
in
my
car
if
my
upholstery
was
cloth
because
im
sure
it
would
smell
great
not
that
i
condone
drinking
and
driving
you
might
spill
yer
drink
too
bad
i
drank
the
founders
that
i
had
in
there
as
fast
as
i
did
and
that
i
had
to
resort
to
this
strong
supporter
of
sammys
products
but
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
pleasant
sweet
aroma
the
cherry
is
nice
to
the
nose
tacky
feel
finish
is
alright
flavor
is
a
lost
cause
for
me
the
beer
has
enough
malt
character
but
the
cherry
just
seems
forced
and
unnatural
slightly
overdone
perhaps
but
i
prefer
cherries
in
darker
beers
solid
effort
and
the
ladies
seem
to
dig
it
so
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
isnt
my
style
this
is
obviously
a
popular
beer
for
sam
adams
but
i
am
not
feeling
it
sorry
jim
mouthfeeldrinkablity
one
surprise
after
another
this
beer
is
dazzling
the
hell
out
of
me
sharp
and
quick
immediately
upon
entering
the
mouth
it
turns
seafoamy
and
slick
within
seconds
and
becomes
liquid
velvet
for
the
remainder
of
its
short
time
there
although
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
for
intense
flavor
reasons
only
this
is
stunningly
enjoyable
and
way
better
than
i
remember
from
years
ago
d
its
alright
this
bottle
was
a
couple
months
old
and
i
think
it
made
it
much
better
still
not
a
great
beer
but
its
pretty
good
i
used
to
like
these
brews
but
over
the
years
i
cant
help
but
hate
it
it
has
a
slightly
couldy
appearance
strong
sents
of
cherry
and
undetones
of
wheat
its
very
sweet
almost
tastes
like
a
cheap
hefeweizen
with
cherry
syrup
in
it
i
think
the
cherry
syrup
taste
ruined
this
one
it
definitely
needs
to
be
toned
down
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
fruit
beer
go
for
a
magic
hat
9
or
something
pours
a
reddish
light
brown
body
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
takes
awhile
to
go
down
some
sweetness
in
the
smell
and
minor
hops
but
the
cherry
is
predominant
a
smooth
somewhat
hoppy
beer
but
the
cherry
overrides
everything
not
only
is
this
mediumbodied
beer
out
of
balance
but
the
cherry
taste
is
sharp
and
cutting
reminded
me
of
cherry
7up
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
it
tickled
my
sweet
tooth
but
i
really
couldnt
stand
it
that
much
and
one
was
enough
for
me
i
liked
this
beer
when
i
first
tried
it
i
ultimately
grew
tired
of
it
after
a
few
years
now
i
can
raise
a
glass
and
fully
appreciate
the
beer
for
what
it
is
although
now
i
wish
that
this
beer
was
a
little
less
filtered
and
closer
to
a
hefe
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
with
a
slight
cherry
taste
towards
the
finish
dto
me
i
couldnt
get
past
a
few
sips
of
this
beer
in
this
case
the
smell
was
better
than
the
taste
hubbys
drinking
the
rest
d
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
to
sweet
for
me
ill
pass
on
another
it
looks
and
feels
like
a
wheat
should
but
damn
its
sweet
this
beer
seems
to
get
a
lot
of
hate
on
this
website
but
i
absolutely
love
it
the
cherry
taste
seems
genuine
and
it
isnt
overbearing
for
me
i
see
some
people
compared
it
to
cough
syrup
which
i
cannot
see
at
all
my
girlfriend
who
doesnt
like
most
beer
will
drink
this
like
nothing
but
its
still
beerey
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
as
well
a
solid
pick
d
lawnmower
says
it
all
for
this
one
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
two
fingers
of
fine
head
topped
it
and
it
displayed
both
good
retention
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
cherries
with
some
metallic
hints
behind
that
which
makes
it
a
little
artificial
the
flavors
were
quite
sweet
at
first
but
not
cloying
but
they
mellowed
out
into
a
maltiness
before
finishing
with
a
yeast
tang
the
tang
is
a
little
bitter
and
it
makes
the
aftertaste
unpleasant
still
i
found
this
one
quite
drinkable
summery
and
generally
pleasant
its
a
good
medium
bodied
beer
and
probably
a
great
swimming
in
the
river
getting
girls
bikini
tops
off
kinda
brew
hell
yeah
this
beer
pours
a
yellowishgolden
color
with
an
inch
of
good
looking
foam
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
fruit
dominated
mostly
by
cherries
light
wheat
character
on
the
palate
with
slight
carbonation
the
flavor
is
artificial
cherry
up
front
with
a
little
tartness
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
a
little
fruity
for
my
tastes
but
at
least
its
not
overly
sweet
overall
i
likes
it
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
orange
color
with
lots
of
head
lotsa
lacing
the
smell
is
like
cherry
coke
and
so
is
the
taste
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
with
adequite
carbonation
this
brew
is
fairly
easy
drinking
i
guess
this
would
be
good
for
people
who
are
gateway
beer
drinkersthey
like
mikes
lemonade
this
beer
really
is
not
for
me
a
bit
too
sweet
basically
another
good
sam
adams
product
i
am
sorry
this
is
pretty
bad
avoid
at
all
costs
apearance
was
nice
but
god
the
smell
completely
over
the
top
cherry
cough
syrup
smell
not
a
hint
of
wheat
that
i
could
discern
taste
was
a
little
more
pleasing
but
still
oh
so
heavy
on
the
cherries
this
was
closer
to
some
kind
of
carbonated
flavored
mixed
drink
from
smirnoff
than
it
was
to
a
beer
taste
wasnt
terrible
but
so
sweet
that
id
never
want
to
drink
more
d
to
sweet
to
be
enjoyable
all
the
time
maybe
ok
as
a
desert
beer
but
not
very
impressive
d
good
for
a
few
have
something
different
an
then
go
back
for
a
few
more
i
am
not
the
descriptive
type
by
far
but
i
have
tried
quite
a
few
of
the
samuel
adams
beers
and
i
can
say
i
really
dont
feel
like
i
am
even
drinking
a
beer
when
i
had
one
of
these
chick
drink
comes
to
mind
my
wife
really
liked
it
though
and
turns
out
the
neigbhors
wife
likes
it
as
well
yet
he
pretty
much
thought
the
same
about
it
this
was
more
of
a
desert
beer
to
me
and
my
friends
than
anything
else
its
a
good
beer
to
finish
off
a
drinking
session
with
buddies
overall
this
is
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
isnt
there
for
me
i
will
tap
out
after
one
or
two
of
these
because
of
the
sweet
cherry
taste
fairly
nice
summer
drink
it
isnt
the
best
beer
but
i
would
recommend
people
at
least
try
it
bought
this
in
a
sam
adams
variety
pack
otherwise
i
wouldnt
have
bought
it
i
still
wouldnt
i
may
be
a
little
too
harsh
but
it
just
tastes
too
much
like
a
cherry
flavored
soda
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
as
a
beer
it
smells
like
cherry
soda
too
for
all
i
know
it
may
be
considered
a
great
fruitvegetable
beer
but
i
just
dont
dig
those
in
general
the
cherry
flavor
is
not
subtle
at
all
and
i
like
when
beer
has
subtle
flavors
this
tastes
like
cherry
soda
with
some
alcohol
in
it
drinkability
this
was
always
my
wifes
favorite
beer
in
college
so
i
had
a
lot
of
it
around
while
she
has
moved
on
to
being
more
of
a
hophead
cherry
wheat
stills
shows
up
once
in
a
while
i
think
it
is
a
nice
fruit
wheat
so
many
of
them
leaving
you
wondering
if
they
actually
added
any
fruit
to
the
beer
i
guess
i
dont
understnad
the
people
complaining
baout
it
tasting
too
much
like
cherries
it
is
what
it
is
a
fruit
beer
d
very
drinkable
beer
t
cherry
all
over
this
some
malts
and
hops
pop
out
at
the
end
but
really
a
nice
mix
a
good
mix
for
a
fruit
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
d
more
drinkable
than
many
flavored
beers
d
once
is
enough
for
me
but
fruity
beers
arent
my
thing
yet
a
little
surprised
as
it
was
a
little
more
complex
than
i
had
it
pegged
for
still
nothing
great
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
had
expected
it
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
nice
foam
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
a
strong
you
guessed
it
cherry
flavor
mild
malts
with
a
zesty
cherry
flavor
a
reference
to
cough
syrup
isnt
unjustified
and
definitely
doesnt
help
its
cause
not
the
greatest
mouthfeel
refreshing
enough
but
probably
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
or
very
often
actually
i
might
not
get
it
again
the
whole
cherry
beer
thing
just
isnt
for
me
drinkability
only
if
you
really
enjoy
it
can
you
go
back
to
back
bottle
poured
a
lightly
red
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sweet
wisconsin
cherries
with
some
more
subtle
wheat
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
sweet
wisconsin
cherries
with
a
light
medicinal
note
that
i
wasnt
exactly
fond
of
wheat
is
very
subdued
and
almost
impossible
to
detect
a
bit
too
much
of
the
cough
syrup
taste
for
my
taste
buds
but
still
a
worthless
effort
tasty
have
had
quite
a
few
of
these
before
solidly
above
average
fruit
beer
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
this
is
a
good
brew
i
am
not
crazy
about
fruit
beers
but
this
has
a
nice
touch
without
overpowering
the
beer
light
and
fruity
very
drinkable
while
not
complex
or
an
overly
great
brew
i
have
found
myself
in
the
position
before
where
this
is
the
best
available
hence
i
have
grown
to
appreciate
this
some
what
mediocre
brew
nothing
wrong
with
it
it
is
what
it
is
simple
brew
with
a
touch
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
for
me
though
there
are
some
redeeming
qualities
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
just
not
doing
it
for
me
i
wont
have
it
again
drinkability
is
low
for
me
the
taste
was
murder
and
i
wont
be
touching
this
again
if
i
can
help
it
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
with
a
lively
yellowishtan
head
that
shows
a
very
faint
pink
hue
aroma
has
a
very
full
nose
of
medicinal
marachino
cherry
and
butterysweet
graham
cracker
crust
im
not
really
detecting
any
hop
aroma
due
to
the
marachino
cherries
taste
is
very
similar
to
aroma
but
at
least
the
cherry
is
not
overpowering
the
malt
which
is
by
the
way
not
as
buttery
or
sweet
as
the
aroma
was
hop
flavor
is
pretty
floral
here
and
bitterness
is
kept
to
a
minimum
to
make
this
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
and
it
finishes
pretty
dry
and
crisp
which
helps
keep
this
beer
from
becoming
too
cloying
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
i
know
a
lot
of
people
dont
like
this
beer
i
do
its
a
good
fruit
beer
pleasantly
crisp
with
good
flavor
its
a
refreshing
beer
just
absolutely
no
balance
to
this
beer
at
all
they
went
wayyy
overboard
with
the
cherries
on
this
one
as
they
dominate
everything
about
this
brew
difficult
to
even
call
it
a
brew
since
i
had
to
work
so
hard
to
try
to
detect
anything
resembling
beer
from
this
one
gotta
rake
this
one
over
the
coals
for
the
total
lack
of
any
balance
and
i
love
cherries
but
i
love
beer
too
no
beer
here
that
i
could
find
might
be
good
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
good
beer
somewhat
of
a
novelty
good
for
sitting
on
the
porch
after
dinner
on
a
summer
night
i
never
was
a
fan
of
sweet
or
fruity
beers
but
i
liked
this
for
its
easy
drinkability
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
seemed
to
finish
a
bit
harsh
at
first
but
smoothed
out
markedly
as
the
beer
went
on
a
bit
of
a
puckering
taste
feels
very
fizzy
and
carbonated
too
might
be
difficult
to
quaff
more
than
a
few
of
these
between
the
strong
flavor
and
the
carbonation
purchased
as
part
of
a
sam
adams
summer
variety
pack
poured
the
beer
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
brownish
orange
in
color
and
the
head
dissipates
to
non
existence
quickly
the
nose
on
this
is
a
cherry
bomb
but
good
if
you
like
cherries
the
taste
initially
is
sweet
cherry
and
cherry
on
the
finish
but
somewhere
in
between
you
can
tell
that
this
is
a
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
just
about
what
you
would
expect
from
the
taste
and
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
i
would
drink
a
few
and
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
the
aroma
is
really
nice
with
a
lovely
cherry
aroma
with
the
wheat
in
the
background
the
taste
is
cherry
all
the
way
through
with
a
crispness
to
it
in
the
mouth
it
is
pretty
thin
overall
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
the
smell
is
the
strongest
part
of
it
to
me
this
beer
is
a
once
in
a
while
thing
i
could
not
drink
this
regularly
poured
with
beautiful
white
head
the
body
was
hazy
with
large
particles
averagely
dispursed
there
was
almost
no
carbonation
and
the
body
hue
was
a
moderately
darker
golden
brown
this
beer
is
rightly
named
the
aroma
was
thick
with
dark
cherries
that
overpowered
almost
every
other
scent
although
there
was
a
light
yeast
at
the
bottom
the
flavor
was
again
overpowered
by
dark
cherries
that
was
heavilyharshly
sweet
with
a
light
bitterness
towards
the
end
the
finish
was
average
length
with
a
tiny
amount
of
bread
and
very
acidic
the
palate
was
a
medium
body
with
a
watery
and
creamy
texture
and
soft
carbonation
d
different
and
versatile
good
but
not
great
solid
but
not
an
everyday
beer
d
this
was
ok
a
lot
of
cherrysyrup
in
the
flavor
which
dominated
everything
this
is
ok
to
drink
neither
one
i
would
pass
down
nor
one
i
would
seek
out
drinkability
good
transition
beer
can
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
feel
too
weighted
down
nice
job
d
its
light
and
drinkable
but
not
very
refreshing
and
not
very
enjoyable
d
not
recommended
at
all
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
id
rather
smell
it
than
drink
it
nah
who
am
i
kidding
its
still
beer
and
its
going
down
the
gullet
overall
actually
not
bad
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
1
or
2
you
get
2
in
the
summer
12pack
and
thats
sufficient
it
tasted
just
like
it
smelled
although
the
cherry
flavor
was
way
to
strong
it
just
tasted
like
beer
with
cherry
juice
in
it
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
not
impressed
at
all
does
anyone
make
a
beer
that
has
a
real
cherry
taste
to
it
i
had
this
brew
for
the
first
time
in
quite
a
while
when
a
friend
had
an
extra
one
sitting
around
it
was
just
as
disappointing
as
i
remembered
it
sure
smells
great
but
the
taste
is
pretty
bad
it
certainly
didnt
look
very
good
as
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
either
no
haziness
despite
being
a
wheat
beer
it
was
very
light
in
body
but
with
a
very
synthetic
and
cloying
cherry
flavor
drink
it
cold
and
its
tolerable
but
let
it
warm
just
a
little
and
you
are
bombarded
with
a
dismal
cherry
cough
syrup
flavored
aftertaste
d
not
impressed
at
all
d
as
i
said
before
this
isnt
the
first
time
ive
had
this
one
but
it
might
be
the
last
i
could
see
this
beer
as
an
ingredient
in
sauces
for
meat
dishes
though
i
dont
think
that
i
would
drink
this
again
it
really
is
just
a
sad
example
of
the
style
my
least
favorite
sam
offering
i
can
say
ive
tried
it
now
pours
a
nice
very
clear
golden
color
not
much
sign
of
the
cherries
there
but
thats
where
the
lack
of
cherry
stops
the
nose
is
cherry
and
not
a
lot
else
i
can
detect
and
while
it
borders
on
authentic
cherry
it
doesnt
quite
make
it
the
taste
is
quite
the
same
but
more
candy
like
but
with
a
bitter
finish
its
got
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
all
in
all
it
drinks
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
yellow
color
with
a
slight
redish
tint
to
it
head
was
very
small
did
not
retain
much
of
it
smell
is
awesome
cherrys
and
sweetness
taste
is
very
malty
low
carbonation
cherry
is
in
there
but
i
dont
feel
its
too
overpowering
slight
bitter
aftertaste
i
could
see
this
going
very
well
with
a
cherry
dessert
or
during
a
nice
winter
party
yet
to
have
a
fresh
sam
adams
i
did
not
enjoy
good
job
sa
it
was
not
horrible
because
it
is
clearly
a
cherry
wheat
beer
but
i
think
it
was
a
little
too
much
on
the
cherries
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
d
im
enjoying
it
much
more
this
time
around
sweet
but
not
quite
too
sweet
the
cherry
is
nice
and
avoids
the
artificial
flavor
many
fruit
beers
have
works
well
with
the
wheat
style
solid
fruit
beer
perfect
fit
for
the
beers
of
summer
12pack
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
one
mine
had
a
nov08
best
by
date
on
it
so
it
must
have
been
fresh
the
fresh
cherry
flavor
was
excellent
and
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
i
could
write
this
summary
up
in
one
word
cherry
ridiculously
overfruited
i
cant
smell
or
taste
anything
else
very
poor
supposed
to
be
beer
with
fruit
added
not
the
other
way
around
drinkability
poor
taste
but
not
poior
enough
to
keep
me
from
drinking
at
least
one
more
then
again
pours
a
slightly
bronze
colorfuzzy
head
that
quickly
fades
leaving
little
lacing
fairly
clear
smell
is
sweet
soft
cherry
essence
some
yeast
taste
is
slighly
sour
with
very
little
wheat
cherry
flavor
is
masked
by
the
sourness
for
some
reason
its
fine
in
a
bottle
but
on
tap
its
not
as
good
at
least
imo
very
little
body
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
moderate
ok
but
not
great
d
this
beer
feels
very
light
and
thus
goes
down
easy
inconsistency
from
one
bottle
to
the
next
is
disconcerting
very
strong
tart
cherry
aroma
and
flavor
dry
tart
crisp
taste
plenty
of
carbonation
which
adds
to
the
crispy
tart
bite
of
the
cherry
flavoring
the
cherry
totally
overpowers
the
wheat
i
can
only
get
one
of
these
down
the
cherry
is
just
too
strong
maybe
theyre
shooting
for
some
old
school
cherry
style
with
this
one
but
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
at
all
bought
a
six
pack
from
four
seasons
liquors
the
beer
settles
with
a
thin
head
throughout
but
with
no
real
lacing
clear
brownred
not
too
amberlike
appearance
aromas
are
potent
cherry
flavors
with
some
thin
grain
hints
not
too
overpowering
just
right
in
potency
taste
is
wicked
good
and
sweet
those
cherrygrain
flavors
are
apparent
and
warmly
wrapped
around
hops
and
malts
mouthfeel
is
basic
and
allows
it
to
be
crisp
but
a
little
light
overall
a
really
good
fruit
beer
from
sam
adams
interesting
sample
but
nothing
above
and
beyond
at
first
when
i
opened
it
i
took
a
big
whiff
and
really
thought
someone
gave
me
cherry
coke
instead
of
beer
i
took
a
sip
and
still
thought
i
was
drinking
cherry
coke
the
cherryness
died
off
some
the
more
i
drank
the
mouthfeel
was
alright
i
dont
believe
i
would
ever
choose
to
drink
this
again
unless
it
was
all
i
had
left
slightly
heavier
body
than
the
average
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
i
could
probably
tolerate
the
cherry
flavor
enough
to
have
this
again
but
not
in
succession
d
this
is
a
good
summertime
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
fruit
beers
with
a
sourness
to
them
but
dont
want
to
spend
the
extra
money
on
the
richer
belgian
fruit
beers
i
enjoyed
it
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
really
believe
you
have
to
drink
this
beer
out
of
the
perfect
pint
glass
from
sam
adams
to
really
appreciate
this
beer
overall
i
was
not
impressed
they
seriously
just
cannot
get
anything
done
with
fruit
flavors
anywhere
near
an
acceptable
level
i
would
not
try
this
one
again
as
its
just
a
waste
of
time
for
d
this
is
an
okay
fruit
beer
it
isnt
a
regular
in
my
fridge
though
i
really
dont
know
about
this
one
it
was
okay
not
great
by
any
means
a
touch
too
fruity
for
my
standards
not
over
bearingly
fruity
but
just
enough
for
me
to
pass
on
this
one
over
all
i
have
had
much
worse
as
far
as
fruited
beers
go
overall
not
too
over
powering
but
a
little
too
much
in
a
beer
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
i
thought
that
cherry
and
wheat
would
be
a
good
mix
and
this
lead
to
high
hopes
of
something
great
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
and
took
a
whiff
nearly
throwing
up
because
of
the
cherry
cough
drop
smell
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
reminiscent
of
cherry
cough
drops
i
had
the
beer
again
after
a
year
hoping
that
the
first
bottle
was
just
a
bad
batch
but
the
second
taste
was
the
same
cherry
cough
drops
probably
a
great
brew
to
drink
with
a
cold
to
supress
the
cough
i
make
no
apologies
on
this
one
it
may
be
okay
for
someone
who
is
trying
to
break
into
craft
beer
but
there
is
waay
too
much
cherry
artificial
flavors
to
be
enjoyable
to
me
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
black
cherry
soda
pop
taste
is
sweet
up
front
but
finishes
dry
flavors
of
maraschino
cherries
and
grain
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
carbonation
high
unfortunatly
the
drinkability
suffers
somewhat
the
sweet
taste
definiately
gets
old
after
one
beer
also
any
more
fruit
flavor
and
sugar
and
this
wouldnt
taste
much
like
beer
but
it
is
pretty
good
and
i
wouldnt
complain
if
i
had
it
again
mfd
a
good
thirst
quencherbbq
beer
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
all
the
time
but
it
did
wonders
on
the
beach
at
the
jersey
shore
serving
type
bottle
d
too
sweet
for
my
liking
to
enjoy
multiple
but
to
try
one
it
was
not
that
bad
dont
drink
and
review
the
cherry
flavor
is
not
cloyingly
sweet
but
there
is
some
natural
sweetness
to
it
that
takes
some
getting
used
to
to
me
the
balance
between
the
wheat
honey
and
cherry
flavors
work
well
together
actually
thought
the
cherry
aroma
was
funkier
than
the
taste
its
definitely
not
an
everyday
session
brew
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
on
a
warm
summer
day
beer
its
not
just
a
beverage
its
food
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
but
couldnt
drink
more
than
2
back
to
back
too
sweet
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
cleary
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
out
there
d
not
recommended
d
dont
want
to
drink
this
beer
as
the
bad
cherry
flavour
comes
out
didnt
like
it
avoid
sam
adams
worst
give
it
a
try
awful
beer
try
to
avoid
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
i
half
expected
this
one
to
be
a
little
darker
or
cloudier
strong
scent
of
cherries
up
front
and
sweet
wheat
malts
in
the
back
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
slightly
tart
sweet
and
big
cherry
flavor
a
god
fruit
beer
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
personally
the
only
reason
this
isnt
a
drain
pour
is
because
im
going
to
pour
the
rest
of
the
pint
into
some
tupperware
to
marinate
meat
in
or
make
some
kind
of
sauce
ditto
for
the
other
bottle
in
the
sampler
d
i
had
a
sixpack
a
year
ago
and
wasnt
so
fond
of
it
decided
to
give
it
another
try
it
seems
very
artificial
though
i
have
met
people
that
love
this
brew
perhaps
if
you
are
into
cherries
and
want
a
semidesert
beer
or
for
someone
that
doesnt
like
beer
m
d
a
happy
point
in
between
slightly
sticky
and
semidry
not
finishing
so
dry
though
it
does
seem
to
get
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
after
a
while
if
i
were
enjoying
sam
adams
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
id
likely
be
far
more
likely
to
go
with
one
of
their
other
offerings
this
one
is
alright
but
thats
about
it
overall
not
that
great
sam
adams
usually
does
a
great
job
on
most
of
their
beers
but
this
misses
the
mark
put
this
one
in
the
same
boat
as
the
cranberry
lambic
that
being
said
i
will
agree
that
of
all
the
fruit
beers
cherry
is
without
a
doubt
the
hardest
to
pull
off
even
using
fresh
organic
cherries
it
can
still
taste
like
cough
syrup
this
is
better
than
average
but
not
quite
up
to
the
sublime
cherry
nirvana
that
is
achieved
by
new
glarus
with
some
work
this
beer
could
be
great
until
then
ill
save
this
a
my
last
beer
out
of
the
six
pack
when
outside
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
in
the
future
no
problem
perfect
with
a
high
quality
dark
chocolate
try
it
with
some
cacao
reserve
and
ill
bet
all
the
ratings
go
up
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
slight
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
behind
a
light
lacing
very
strong
smell
of
cherry
with
a
faint
hint
of
the
wheat
on
the
back
end
taste
has
a
little
bitterness
to
go
with
the
cherries
that
finishes
with
a
faint
spice
and
dryness
good
amount
of
carbonation
dominates
the
mouth
i
might
be
able
to
drink
two
but
the
sweetness
and
the
carbonation
would
probably
prevent
me
from
having
anymore
da
dessert
beer
or
maybe
a
good
beer
gateway
beer
i
just
wish
theyd
tone
it
down
a
bit
so
that
some
other
flavors
had
a
chance
to
present
themselves
then
maybe
the
drinkability
wouldnt
suffer
as
much
wheats
dont
seem
to
be
this
brewerys
niche
though
their
white
ale
is
pretty
decent
might
pair
well
with
some
fruit
cheesecake
but
you
would
need
to
enjoy
the
smell
of
this
beer
its
a
bit
milky
but
not
thick
feels
like
a
smoothie
this
one
is
pretty
nice
overall
nice
balance
on
the
edge
of
oversweetness
but
a
good
summery
wheat
beer
overall
d
when
taking
a
long
pull
the
texture
is
almost
creamy
and
rather
enjoyable
but
the
cherry
sort
of
wears
on
me
after
a
while
if
you
like
the
fruit
this
isnt
bad
well
it
isnt
bad
anyway
but
i
guess
im
just
not
into
the
fruit
unless
its
a
lambic
d
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
d
the
candylike
nature
of
this
brew
makes
it
less
like
a
beer
and
more
like
a
drier
off
tasting
soda
i
might
have
a
couple
but
i
wouldnt
make
a
night
of
these
its
simply
too
intense
and
too
simple
overall
not
worth
it
this
is
a
brewmasters
collection
whatever
this
is
a
hobbyist
experiment
gone
wrong
at
best
i
truly
wish
sam
adams
would
take
this
out
of
what
would
be
an
outstanding
summer
variety
pack
as
it
is
this
one
beer
bruises
the
eye
of
their
summer
pack
boo
sam
adams
badly
played
not
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
a
little
cloying
i
enjoyed
drinking
one
but
i
dont
think
i
could
really
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
however
in
my
limited
experience
with
cherry
beers
ive
found
the
beercherry
combination
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
unless
its
incredibly
subtle
i
prefer
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
instead
of
jolly
ranchers
i
would
not
want
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
it
has
a
light
hazy
body
pale
golden
color
and
a
big
thick
white
head
the
aroma
of
cherries
is
very
strong
in
this
beer
there
are
some
light
malt
flavors
that
are
mostly
covered
up
by
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
and
honey
the
taste
is
good
but
the
body
doesnt
really
support
the
sweetness
its
light
to
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouth
feel
its
a
very
good
looking
and
smelling
beer
but
its
balance
is
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
however
this
may
go
well
with
a
dark
chocolate
brownie
i
think
i
will
give
that
a
try
d
its
not
too
sweet
and
doesnt
really
overpower
you
in
any
big
way
but
that
said
it
doesnt
stand
out
a
whole
lot
in
its
flavor
either
its
a
nice
changeofpace
beer
but
not
something
i
would
session
with
or
drink
regularly
pours
a
dark
slightly
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
strong
smell
of
artifical
cherries
taste
is
also
full
of
cherry
flavoring
i
found
it
too
sweet
and
artificial
syrup
tasting
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
like
a
wheat
beer
should
be
it
seems
that
this
is
one
you
either
really
like
or
really
dont
unfortunatley
not
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
is
good
but
i
think
the
cherry
would
get
old
after
a
while
notes
a
lot
of
talk
regarding
whether
this
is
a
chic
beer
i
suppose
that
many
women
do
like
fruit
flavorsbut
a
good
beer
is
a
good
beer
regardless
of
style
i
do
not
prefer
fruitvegetable
beers
and
yet
i
thought
this
would
be
a
good
alternative
to
a
corona
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
buy
one
from
time
to
time
and
while
this
beer
may
not
define
or
represent
the
manliness
of
the
beer
i
normally
drink
it
is
fine
for
certain
moments
i
do
not
care
to
worry
what
the
macho
men
seem
to
think
i
drink
for
the
experience
and
not
the
hang
over
d
no
doubt
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
with
my
tour
through
the
spring
style
beers
this
is
another
good
example
of
what
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
this
was
my
biggest
disappointment
when
it
comes
to
sam
adams
i
hate
to
label
it
as
a
chick
beer
but
i
fear
it
may
be
that
the
cherries
overpower
any
taste
that
a
beer
would
have
to
each
his
own
but
this
is
not
for
me
d
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
if
you
like
fruit
beers
you
might
want
to
try
this
one
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
move
it
into
the
lineup
edit
upon
further
reviewing
i
found
out
that
cherry
wheat
does
not
settle
well
in
the
stomach
when
it
follows
a
thick
red
namely
a
st
rouge
red
drinkable
as
a
fauxfruityfauxfruit
beer
can
be
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
drinkability
tasty
im
not
a
big
sam
adams
fan
but
this
one
worked
for
me
md
feels
like
a
pale
ale
but
the
cough
syrup
flavor
makes
it
more
suitable
to
drink
only
1
or
2
i
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
a
lot
of
the
fruit
infused
beers
on
the
market
i
actually
enjoyed
the
ale
in
the
very
sam
adams
glass
that
was
ever
so
generously
sent
to
me
from
the
sam
adams
brewery
for
being
a
founding
member
of
the
great
beer
advocate
magazine
cheers
the
wheaty
taste
and
hint
of
black
cherries
made
it
very
quaffable
as
a
light
after
dinner
dessert
drink
this
beer
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
definately
cherry
almost
like
ludens
cough
drops
in
beer
form
which
can
be
a
plus
or
minus
depending
on
who
you
are
this
is
definately
an
easier
drink
to
have
but
in
no
means
is
any
form
of
a
manly
man
beer
but
its
good
however
for
fruit
beers
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
my
top
10
its
a
good
beer
to
try
out
but
after
2
the
taste
gets
alittle
too
much
for
me
drinkability
is
fairly
low
low
alcohol
makes
for
easy
consumption
but
strong
cherry
flavor
becomes
taxing
a
beer
for
lovers
of
fruit
and
sweetness
hop
fans
may
want
to
look
elsewhere
sorry
to
gush
great
with
desserts
or
just
to
add
a
sweet
counterpart
to
a
meal
i
am
giving
this
beer
a
better
review
than
i
think
i
should
mainly
because
i
think
it
will
fill
a
good
void
of
giving
me
the
drink
i
need
when
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
a
stronger
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
for
one
or
two
bottles
this
beer
is
a
mediocre
wheat
beer
with
lots
of
cherry
flavoring
it
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
some
head
and
retention
and
a
hint
of
red
probably
from
the
copious
quantity
of
cherry
thrown
in
here
the
lacing
is
modest
the
smell
is
all
cherry
perhaps
a
smidgen
of
strawberry
vanilla
and
almond
as
the
beer
settles
there
is
some
grainy
wheat
hints
that
pop
through
this
is
a
moderately
carbonated
light
bodied
fairly
simple
beer
that
just
smacks
of
cherry
and
not
much
else
cherry
soda
is
not
far
off
the
mark
with
this
one
hops
im
still
looking
for
them
ive
had
plenty
of
lambics
and
this
one
is
just
not
in
the
same
league
its
an
okay
somewhat
change
a
pace
type
beer
that
is
a
novelty
would
i
buy
it
or
try
it
again
no
but
that
does
not
mean
it
isnt
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
go
particularly
out
of
the
way
to
find
it
however
the
aftertaste
is
thin
and
it
really
has
a
pretty
flat
finish
what
else
can
one
say
about
an
entirely
average
beer
it
does
smell
nice
though
d
enjoyable
beer
a
little
sweet
but
probably
intended
this
way
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
good
session
beer
if
you
can
get
past
the
overwhelming
aroma
drinkability
is
a
3
0
only
because
its
really
difficult
for
me
to
get
past
the
smell
every
time
i
take
a
drink
too
heavy
for
light
stylenot
quite
naturalbetter
options
in
this
space
i
used
to
really
really
hate
this
one
i
pretty
much
still
do
theres
a
plethora
of
fruit
beers
that
i
enjoy
some
even
with
cherry
flavouring
but
this
one
just
does
not
work
on
any
level
save
for
a
very
nice
appearance
this
beer
needs
to
be
seriously
reworked
stay
away
d
drinkability
was
like
a
cherry
7up
pass
on
this
one
do
give
it
a
try
my
friends
mother
also
tried
this
out
to
whom
doesnt
really
drink
beer
outside
of
bud
she
said
it
tasted
like
cherry
pepsi
i
would
say
this
could
appeal
to
casual
beer
drinkers
but
is
a
meh
pick
for
veteran
beer
drinkers
d
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
commercial
beer
available
thats
not
a
lambic
or
lambic
variant
way
different
ballgame
it
has
a
nice
fruit
flavor
but
isnt
cloying
and
has
a
nice
strong
beer
base
backing
it
enjoyable
anytime
of
year
golden
amber
colored
pour
smell
is
big
maraschino
cherry
flavor
and
even
though
i
dont
normally
like
the
artificially
cherrylike
smell
i
kind
of
liked
enjoyed
the
smell
as
it
mixed
with
the
light
wheatiness
taste
was
similar
but
a
slightly
more
subdued
cherry
flavor
although
it
is
still
quite
noticeable
as
is
the
wheat
maybe
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
overall
but
this
is
something
id
drink
again
and
still
like
just
as
much
as
before
i
became
somewhat
choosy
about
my
beers
d
very
easy
to
drink
went
down
like
a
soda
i
could
pound
these
on
a
really
hot
day
in
the
summer
but
i
fear
my
mommy
would
yell
me
at
and
wind
up
with
a
tummy
ache
d
i
drank
this
one
slowly
and
sort
of
regretted
ordering
it
this
is
a
very
fruity
beer
with
a
powerful
scent
of
cherries
it
has
a
rich
flavor
of
wheat
malt
and
cherries
noticeable
in
every
sip
its
taste
would
best
accompany
a
cooked
sandwich
or
hamburger
being
sweet
and
fruity
the
feel
is
bubbly
on
the
tongue
it
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
id
drink
more
then
one
of
in
a
sitting
d
i
could
maybe
drink
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
the
amount
of
fruit
would
make
me
want
a
change
drinkability
excellent
beer
to
quaff
down
several
in
a
sitting
probably
more
resigned
to
springsummer
months
though
as
opposed
to
winter
but
none
the
less
i
would
recommend
it
to
try
my
wife
like
it
so
id
consider
getting
a
six
pack
and
having
her
drink
5
but
for
the
most
part
ill
only
get
a
single
every
couple
of
years
there
are
better
sam
adams
beers
and
better
flavored
beers
i
e
southern
tiers
pumpking
taste
has
hints
of
cherries
but
is
not
overwhelming
for
a
fruit
beer
decent
malt
presence
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
could
have
used
more
balance
though
the
tartness
and
the
bitterness
seemed
to
conflict
this
is
a
pretty
good
and
refreshing
fruit
beer
the
beer
pours
very
nicely
with
a
light
amber
color
topped
by
a
thin
dense
silky
white
head
that
remained
throughout
drinking
it
it
smelled
of
fresh
wild
cherries
the
taste
was
quite
crisp
with
strong
wild
cherry
flavor
and
underlying
wheat
malt
the
cherry
flavor
is
the
star
of
the
show
here
this
would
be
a
good
dessert
beer
every
once
and
a
while
but
i
wouldnt
want
it
every
day
its
a
decent
change
of
pace
and
cherry
lovers
will
dance
in
the
streets
everywhere
with
this
i
however
wished
for
balance
that
was
ultimately
unrequited
notes
its
a
fruit
beer
so
some
people
are
going
to
like
this
beer
and
some
people
arent
id
say
it
would
be
a
decent
beer
to
try
once
or
maybe
a
good
desert
beer
or
something
to
go
along
with
a
salad
still
for
what
its
trying
to
pull
off
it
does
fairly
well
its
a
bland
wheat
ale
thats
flavored
with
cherries
readily
available
pours
a
nice
redtinged
golden
color
with
good
head
but
not
so
much
lacing
has
an
excellent
crips
scent
strawlike
with
great
fruit
overtones
a
great
taste
too
although
maybe
a
little
overboard
on
the
cherry
still
a
great
fruited
wheat
beer
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nice
blending
of
the
fruit
goes
down
fine
would
never
say
no
to
another
this
was
all
right
there
is
a
real
cherry
background
to
it
which
i
kind
of
liked
but
it
never
really
developed
much
complexity
to
it
the
wheat
beer
behind
the
cherry
flavor
was
all
right
too
but
when
mixed
together
it
didnt
really
go
anywhere
the
beer
and
cherry
flavors
did
not
seem
to
complement
each
other
as
well
as
they
could
have
i
dont
regret
trying
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
a
6pack
i
do
not
normally
like
fruit
beers
but
this
was
a
part
of
a
mix
pack
and
i
gave
it
a
try
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
have
even
had
this
very
beer
before
and
not
liked
it
but
i
like
it
this
time
might
be
the
glass
5
liter
wheat
beer
glass
this
helps
taste
the
cherry
which
may
be
a
tad
too
much
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
dessert
nice
job
bbc
drinkability
is
ok
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
during
the
winter
and
probably
enjoy
them
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
will
become
one
of
my
regulars
i
have
a
6pack
to
kill
i
think
ill
take
my
time
with
it
dark
goldenamber
ale
small
dissapearing
off
white
head
strong
cherry
cough
medicine
aroma
not
bad
at
this
time
of
year
after
a
while
the
harsh
medicinal
tone
goes
and
it
has
a
scent
of
glazed
cherries
pretty
straighforward
taste
cherry
dominates
but
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
might
lead
one
to
believe
actually
gets
a
wee
bit
bitter
on
the
end
like
cherry
pits
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
its
only
the
pleasing
carbonation
that
stops
it
being
downright
watery
what
can
i
say
a
pleasant
enough
drink
better
in
hotter
weather
im
generally
fine
with
most
of
the
sam
adams
products
especially
those
that
are
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
i
e
imperial
pilsner
however
their
cherry
wheat
misses
the
mark
the
look
is
fine
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
smell
is
not
so
great
maraschino
cherry
syrup
very
sweet
and
cloying
the
taste
is
not
so
cloying
but
still
nothing
good
too
sweet
when
there
should
be
some
tartness
mouthfeel
is
like
soda
bordering
on
harsh
yeah
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
could
see
people
enjoying
this
one
its
like
beer
but
not
recommendation
to
avoid
id
rather
drink
king
cobra
good
lord
great
with
spicy
wings
overall
a
pretty
decent
fruit
beer
not
being
a
big
fan
of
the
style
i
liked
this
sa
addition
i
dont
think
i
could
take
down
a
whole
6pack
and
at
5
2
its
not
the
fruit
beer
you
take
very
lightly
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
so
i
recommend
it
for
its
sneakiness
the
color
is
a
light
amber
that
is
a
little
cloudy
and
has
some
hints
of
an
orange
tint
to
it
as
well
it
definitely
is
a
beer
that
smells
like
cherries
mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
smell
also
the
cherry
smells
remind
me
of
maraschinos
or
those
ludens
cough
drops
the
taste
is
alright
as
one
can
taste
some
kind
of
cherry
taste
mixed
in
but
it
is
not
too
prevalent
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
similar
to
what
one
would
get
from
drinking
a
cherry
coke
which
is
a
light
cherry
taste
lingering
on
the
tongue
overall
it
is
an
average
beer
and
at
least
it
is
not
too
fruity
one
can
tell
that
this
is
a
beer
and
not
some
kind
of
malt
beverage
which
is
nice
my
biggest
complaint
would
be
that
there
does
not
really
seem
to
be
a
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
cherries
too
much
sometimes
it
almost
seems
like
the
two
flavors
are
clashing
with
each
other
mouthfeeldrinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
thes
but
i
think
that
i
would
get
tired
of
them
quick
i
do
however
think
they
would
be
good
with
a
nice
cigar
average
drinkability
on
this
one
its
an
interesting
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
much
of
it
its
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
it
would
be
a
good
special
occasion
desert
beer
first
of
all
i
would
like
to
say
im
going
to
be
very
open
minded
with
any
review
that
i
do
knowing
that
everyone
has
their
dislikes
and
likes
i
would
like
to
start
out
by
saying
for
a
5
35
alcohol
content
beer
this
is
a
very
good
choice
to
get
with
the
ladys
as
it
is
smooth
and
lacks
that
overall
beer
taste
alot
of
woman
despise
i
am
reviewing
this
as
a
flavored
beer
cause
thats
what
it
is
if
your
not
the
flavor
beer
kind
of
person
dont
waste
your
time
purchasing
this
i
think
the
smell
of
this
beers
is
amazing
smelling
of
cherrys
of
course
the
head
is
really
thick
and
just
perfect
the
taste
is
very
smooth
cherry
taste
with
a
faint
wheat
flavor
with
no
sign
of
any
alcohol
taste
around
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
its
alcohol
content
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
excellent
choice
best
flavored
beer
ive
ever
had
samuel
adams
has
always
been
my
favorite
beer
company
and
they
have
not
failed
me
on
this
one
the
bottom
line
the
smell
on
this
gave
me
hope
the
flavour
took
it
away
i
like
fruit
and
vegetable
beers
but
this
one
just
has
something
wonky
going
on
in
the
flavour
department
a
disappointment
d
null
for
me
on
this
one
im
not
entirely
certain
i
can
even
finish
one
maybe
if
cherry
7up
is
your
favorite
soda
and
youve
been
dying
to
try
an
alcoholic
version
this
will
be
for
you
otherwise
i
do
not
recommend
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
a
little
cloudiness
not
transparent
and
had
a
nice
34
inch
head
that
lasted
for
most
of
the
glass
this
has
an
overwhelming
smell
of
sweet
cherries
upon
my
first
sip
i
could
taste
the
cherries
i
had
smelled
but
was
surprised
at
the
bitter
bite
the
brew
had
there
was
subtle
hints
of
spice
but
i
could
not
get
past
the
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
had
decent
carbonation
and
more
weight
than
a
light
beer
had
i
cannot
figure
what
the
after
taste
is
but
i
do
not
like
italmost
to
the
point
of
not
drinking
any
more
of
the
sixpack
my
wife
bought
for
me
to
try
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
not
one
i
will
make
any
repeat
purchases
of
i
am
sure
that
this
otherwise
perfect
brewery
has
to
be
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
generally
i
do
not
enjoy
fruit
flavored
beers
but
this
beer
and
saranacs
pomegranate
wheat
are
the
two
major
fruit
flavored
beers
that
do
it
for
me
try
this
underrated
sam
adams
if
you
enjoy
fruit
beers
the
cherry
flavor
is
very
evident
and
the
wheat
hangs
around
the
edges
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
throughout
with
a
slightly
harsher
finish
the
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
is
skewed
slightly
toward
the
former
but
not
overly
so
giving
it
an
appealling
taste
throughout
each
sip
the
almond
nose
gives
it
an
extra
nuance
each
time
and
together
the
flavors
and
aroma
provide
an
overall
rather
refreshing
beer
this
is
one
excellent
beer
that
is
always
a
nice
sweet
break
from
bitter
beers
once
in
a
while
it
pours
an
excellent
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
body
even
looks
a
little
cherryish
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
cherries
the
taste
is
just
that
sweet
malts
and
cherries
but
like
the
candy
kinds
of
cherries
it
really
is
a
nice
taste
and
it
almost
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
beer
it
gets
a
more
beery
taste
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
but
other
than
that
this
beer
is
pretty
much
cherries
great
aftertaste
and
excellent
mouthfeel
try
this
beer
it
is
definately
worth
a
shot
this
beer
pours
a
medium
dark
yellow
very
little
head
smell
of
this
beer
is
ok
with
just
a
hit
of
wheat
and
cherry
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
what
sold
me
on
it
the
cherry
shines
through
but
at
the
same
time
is
not
to
over
powering
or
sweet
the
cherry
stays
with
it
all
the
way
through
the
palate
and
the
wheat
gives
it
balance
mouthfeel
is
average
a
bit
on
the
light
side
drinkability
is
a
tough
call
while
it
is
very
drinkable
i
think
that
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
to
drink
it
i
think
sometimes
it
would
seem
great
and
just
what
i
want
other
times
i
could
see
only
having
one
and
switching
quickly
that
said
i
think
it
is
worth
a
try
and
would
buy
it
again
d
yeah
but
the
cherry
annoys
me
after
a
while
a
good
contender
for
this
style
i
only
wish
everyone
could
use
real
fruit
instead
of
flavor
syrups
d
good
for
a
couple
beers
only
i
dont
think
drinking
an
entire
sixer
of
this
is
doable
you
will
be
over
it
after
a
beer
or
two
but
all
in
all
a
must
try
the
mouth
seems
just
about
average
drinkabilty
is
a
tougher
call
for
me
would
i
drink
this
all
night
no
would
i
drink
this
one
once
and
a
while
sure
got
this
6pack
at
walshs
in
brighton
ma
after
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
cracked
open
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
moderate
to
little
head
with
gentler
poor
attractive
brown
almost
red
hint
smelled
amazing
i
dont
believe
ive
ever
given
a
5
for
smell
but
this
definitely
warrants
a
5
sweet
cherries
hops
and
sweet
malts
taste
was
great
nice
cherry
taste
without
being
too
overwhelming
or
sweet
but
still
present
sweet
malts
and
hops
follow
behind
but
the
cherry
flavor
will
be
the
most
memorable
taste
only
downfall
of
this
beer
is
that
because
of
its
sweet
nature
its
drinkability
is
severely
decreased
would
not
be
able
to
get
more
than
two
down
in
one
sitting
let
alone
session
with
it
overall
delicious
beer
give
it
a
try
if
nothing
else
it
acts
as
a
great
gateway
for
crossovers
from
macros
to
craft
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
very
drinkable
taste
is
hard
to
deal
with
and
it
is
pretty
heavy
to
along
with
that
unfortunately
this
one
was
a
disappointment
im
finding
it
hard
to
get
past
the
bitter
metal
taste
of
this
beer
definitely
not
going
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
overall
if
you
are
seeking
for
a
liquid
dessert
this
might
hit
the
spot
but
not
something
to
drink
the
whole
night
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
you
can
really
taste
the
cherries
and
the
crispness
of
it
makes
it
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
its
hot
outside
this
was
a
disappointment
glad
i
only
bought
one
wheat
they
had
last
winter
it
seems
a
touch
out
of
balance
this
beer
is
fake
and
flabby
and
not
my
style
i
also
feel
it
is
overcarbonated
as
well
the
flavors
do
persist
at
the
end
overall
this
is
not
for
me
it
is
everything
that
is
wrong
with
fruit
beer
sam
adams
for
the
win
overall
a
decent
drinkable
cherry
beer
and
something
id
drink
again
but
nothing
amazing
ive
brewed
with
real
cherries
and
canned
and
cherry
flavoring
from
steinbart
i
think
cherries
are
tough
to
brew
with
and
not
get
a
cough
syrup
result
from
and
spam
has
done
pretty
well
with
this
one
im
more
impressed
than
i
thought
id
be
average
not
one
of
sams
adams
best
not
really
all
that
drinkable
i
could
have
one
or
two
at
the
most
a
little
too
much
cherry
sweetness
for
my
palate
but
overall
not
bad
did
smell
good
however
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
not
much
lacing
on
glass
clear
robust
gold
color
with
a
soft
sticky
milky
looking
head
aroma
is
sweet
cherry
juice
holding
back
any
malts
trying
to
sneak
through
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
in
the
way
back
upon
the
first
sip
there
is
a
striking
lack
of
anything
the
aroma
has
me
anticipating
a
syrupy
mess
and
what
i
get
is
blandness
i
suppose
its
better
than
a
sloppy
coughsyrupy
artificial
fruit
beer
at
least
i
can
drink
this
the
palest
of
light
malts
a
faint
sweetness
and
watered
down
cherries
its
crisp
and
refreshing
not
a
bad
body
for
a
summery
beer
but
its
almost
as
if
the
mouthfeel
is
more
in
focus
than
the
flavor
good
if
youre
doing
things
out
in
the
sun
and
using
beer
purely
for
refreshment
at
least
its
not
as
unpleasant
as
i
remember
it
being
mouthfeel
is
light
obvious
cherry
nose
and
faint
hint
of
wheat
and
hops
pours
light
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
extreem
cherry
taste
with
some
maltiness
and
hint
of
wheat
that
is
quickly
offset
by
a
jolly
rancher
like
taste
initially
it
throws
you
off
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
it
really
taste
like
some
sort
of
soda
ive
had
these
before
and
its
a
nice
change
if
you
like
the
fruit
flavored
beers
im
not
sure
i
would
recognize
this
offering
as
beer
rather
than
soda
in
a
blind
test
well
maybe
the
alcohol
would
tip
me
off
but
even
so
the
taste
is
a
cloying
cherry
punch
with
perhaps
a
dusting
of
wheat
flour
but
only
a
dusting
the
smell
reveled
the
onedimensionality
of
this
before
i
even
had
a
swig
and
the
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
and
lightly
carbonated
like
a
soda
not
recommended
im
going
to
get
a
few
more
before
the
end
of
summer
dfor
what
it
is
it
isnt
awful
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
would
like
a
little
more
than
cherries
ive
heard
pretty
good
things
about
sam
adams
beers
so
i
wont
let
this
beer
discourage
me
from
trying
the
others
but
this
one
is
pretty
nasty
it
seems
that
the
cherry
wheat
i
remember
from
college
tasted
like
a
beer
with
a
cherry
finish
but
now
it
seems
to
be
all
cherry
i
will
pass
on
this
mediocre
wheat
dr
pepper
cough
drop
unsatisfactory
sam
adams
does
a
whole
lot
of
things
right
better
than
right
this
is
not
one
of
them
hell
give
me
the
cranberry
lambic
instead
pours
a
one
finger
tan
head
over
a
crystal
clear
bright
light
orange
liquid
smells
of
marchiano
cherry
sweet
and
preserved
fruity
tastes
rather
unpleasant
marchiano
cherry
meets
jelly
belly
in
a
carbonated
beverage
syrupy
cough
medicine
flavor
with
a
very
odd
endaftertaste
cherry
is
in
the
flavor
line
of
cherry
cola
carbonation
on
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
can
get
rid
of
the
cherry
flavor
but
does
dry
out
the
beer
a
bit
medium
body
but
thick
in
a
syrupy
way
that
makes
me
wonder
about
how
the
cherry
flavor
was
imparted
mdheavy
carbonation
this
was
a
dumper
blech
dnot
for
me
if
i
want
a
cherry
cough
drop
ill
suck
on
one
i
think
sammy
does
a
nice
job
with
their
beers
for
the
most
part
but
this
one
needs
to
be
reworked
or
eliminated
this
is
my
first
fruit
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
this
beer
is
good
but
i
still
have
this
sense
that
there
may
be
a
few
too
many
cherries
in
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
but
is
lightened
a
bit
by
moderate
carbonation
a
nice
summer
brew
not
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
not
as
bad
as
many
people
insist
a
quality
product
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
slight
hue
of
amber
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
small
cap
the
smell
is
of
a
cherry
bomb
smells
like
a
cherry
cough
drop
artificial
i
never
smelled
actual
cherries
that
were
this
strong
before
the
taste
is
metallic
watered
down
cherry
nyquil
a
touch
of
honey
the
cherry
takes
over
the
whole
flavor
palate
the
feel
is
ok
its
light
and
fairly
crisp
i
used
to
like
this
beer
a
whole
lot
more
back
in
the
day
but
after
trying
many
more
beers
that
are
out
there
this
doesnt
stack
up
the
cherry
taste
is
too
artificial
and
strong
should
be
more
subtle
white
to
offwhite
head
which
settled
down
but
has
good
lacing
beer
itself
is
clear
gold
theres
clearly
cherry
in
the
smell
and
a
mild
honey
sweetness
underneath
no
discernible
hops
on
this
one
cherrys
also
in
the
taste
but
unlike
some
other
reviewers
i
didnt
find
it
overly
sweet
some
honey
fills
in
toward
the
end
i
did
expect
a
bit
more
crispness
from
the
wheat
in
this
beer
so
that
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
was
also
hoping
it
would
be
unfiltered
the
yeast
would
add
to
the
flavor
profile
but
ah
well
this
is
more
of
a
honey
ale
than
a
honey
wheat
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
id
likely
turn
elsewhere
after
drinking
one
of
these
compared
with
other
s
a
beers
this
is
not
what
i
expect
overall
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
borders
on
alcopop
it
would
be
nice
if
the
good
people
at
sa
would
reformulate
this
or
remove
it
altogether
from
its
fine
line
of
brews
poured
from
a
12
oz
glass
with
november
2007
bestby
date
poured
into
a
hefeweizen
glass
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
looks
pictureperfect
great
retention
smells
of
sweet
cherries
and
honey
flavors
of
the
cherries
wheat
touch
of
honey
not
too
complex
but
still
nice
and
clean
to
drink
lightbodied
mouthfeel
very
easily
drinkable
great
summer
beer
the
first
beer
that
got
me
into
the
hobby
great
beer
for
summer
cookouts
and
for
casual
drinking
smell
is
great
fruity
but
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
sip
on
these
all
day
and
still
not
get
sick
of
it
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
defiantly
a
good
one
drinkability
sorry
but
not
very
drinkable
at
least
for
me
i
didnt
appreciate
the
metallic
wang
and
the
general
impression
was
that
i
was
taking
down
a
spoonful
of
robitussin
with
every
pull
from
my
pint
glass
nothing
here
that
im
eager
to
revisit
anytime
soon
this
is
one
of
my
staple
summer
beers
since
i
first
got
the
nerve
to
drink
any
beer
with
fruit
flavoring
quite
a
few
years
ago
this
and
9
are
my
never
fail
fruit
beers
i
know
these
in
no
way
compare
to
some
of
the
hard
core
european
fruit
offerings
and
well
they
shouldnt
this
is
closer
to
the
mow
the
lawn
beer
and
they
go
down
so
easy
the
color
is
almost
straw
with
a
hint
of
copper
tone
the
head
is
fair
and
lively
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
beautiful
cherry
blended
with
a
bit
of
cerealwheat
as
one
might
expect
it
smells
crisp
and
it
tastes
much
the
same
a
light
and
refreshing
wash
of
pilsnerlike
flavor
laced
with
a
decided
cherry
sweetness
somewhat
dry
but
also
a
bit
watery
for
a
quenching
libation
that
finishes
with
a
tasteful
tartness
nothing
very
complex
and
easy
to
drink
many
this
is
my
light
beer
vaguely
sodaesque
but
it
retains
its
beer
integrity
in
my
book
may
be
too
soda
like
for
some
beer
fans
but
it
works
for
me
if
you
dont
like
the
aroma
try
drinking
it
from
the
bottle
d
a
good
but
not
great
beer
id
say
blue
moon
is
better
than
this
but
a
pretty
interesting
offering
if
just
a
bit
gimmicky
would
not
pick
this
one
up
on
a
regular
basis
sampled
at
the
spot
in
bethel
cherry
wheat
looks
really
nice
in
the
glass
nice
hazy
gold
with
a
great
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
too
fruity
i
would
have
maybe
liked
more
malty
balance
same
goes
for
the
taste
cherry
flavor
is
somewhat
artificial
tasting
and
too
sweet
sweet
aftertaste
hurts
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
as
well
not
an
awful
beer
but
definitely
not
an
award
winner
either
part
of
the
summer
sampler
12
pack
decent
beer
gold
color
with
a
medium
head
aroma
just
gave
off
a
little
sweetness
the
cherry
came
through
thankfully
on
the
taste
pleasantly
sour
the
label
says
it
is
crisp
and
i
would
agree
with
that
assessment
refreshing
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
that
fit
that
category
recommended
not
sure
id
buy
this
one
again
and
im
a
fan
of
every
other
sam
adams
product
ive
tried
thus
far
not
recommended
but
the
apperance
is
good
eric
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
mid
stream
all
the
way
d
not
for
me
the
fake
cherry
flavor
puts
me
off
way
too
fast
somethings
amiss
here
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
aroma
is
strong
cherry
scent
is
dominant
color
is
deep
golden
honeyamber
flavor
is
malty
and
pleasant
with
a
strong
cherry
overtone
and
wheaty
components
finish
is
smooth
and
pleasant
i
am
fond
of
cherries
which
is
one
reason
i
like
this
particular
beer
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
from
the
everyday
domestic
beers
no
heavy
carbonation
and
it
doesnt
have
that
watery
finish
of
some
beers
good
aftertaste
of
cherries
no
bitterness
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
highly
recommended
just
remember
to
bring
a
little
spare
cash
with
you
ill
finish
my
sixer
but
with
no
great
enjoyment
wow
sam
adams
made
a
mistake
in
judgment
here
the
taste
is
like
cough
syrup
not
syrupy
but
watered
down
carbonated
cough
syrup
very
bad
brew
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
even
if
it
was
the
only
thing
available
id
rather
drink
water
or
a
soda
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
faint
haze
maintains
a
creamy
white
head
with
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
pleasing
cherry
aroma
a
faint
cherry
bitterness
is
balanced
out
by
a
malt
sweetness
while
the
nose
is
relatively
fresh
the
taste
is
of
cherry
cough
drops
the
initial
sweetness
on
the
tongue
is
quickly
banished
by
dry
bland
wheat
the
wheat
and
cherry
cough
drop
flavors
are
unable
to
blend
together
and
both
stick
around
long
into
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
bit
of
water
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
any
cloying
sweetness
allow
me
to
finish
the
beer
but
i
certainly
wont
be
having
it
again
part
of
the
sam
adams
summer
pack
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
forming
a
creamy
2
inch
head
leaving
medium
rings
of
lace
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
just
like
a
blackcherry
soda
this
might
be
a
turnoff
to
some
but
i
think
it
smells
great
the
taste
is
a
little
less
strong
but
not
a
disappointment
cherry
flavor
mixed
in
with
a
light
wheat
ale
thats
about
it
simple
but
enjoyable
light
smooth
mouthfeel
and
finish
easy
to
drink
overall
i
actually
enjoyed
this
brew
while
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
i
could
see
having
one
or
two
throughout
the
night
definitely
worth
a
try
im
curious
to
try
some
of
the
mixes
that
people
use
with
this
beer
part
of
the
summer
beers
mixed
12
pack
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
color
a
big
fluffy
one
inch
head
which
slowly
fades
to
a
leave
just
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
cherries
and
little
else
taste
is
of
tart
cherries
and
sweet
malt
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
not
bad
for
a
flavored
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
its
way
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
i
personally
dont
like
the
taste
very
much
so
i
find
its
drinkability
extremely
limited
overall
its
a
very
average
beer
one
of
the
weakest
sam
adams
offerings
in
my
opinion
i
love
wheat
beers
but
this
was
a
let
down
pours
a
clear
golden
color
others
are
talking
about
a
cloudy
pour
i
had
none
of
that
clearest
wheat
beer
ive
ever
seen
2
finger
head
stuck
around
a
while
leave
small
amounts
of
lace
smells
like
cough
syrup
and
i
cant
get
over
that
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
pretty
crisp
with
hint
of
cherries
and
some
hops
moderate
carbonation
gives
it
a
mediumlight
mouthfeel
could
possibly
have
another
but
not
interested
in
anymore
just
cant
get
over
the
smell
drinkability
i
was
surprised
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
sweet
and
i
wouldnt
like
it
i
loved
it
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
those
youll
laugh
but
it
reminds
me
of
captain
crunch
berry
cereal
lol
im
going
to
have
to
give
up
on
fruit
beers
opening
the
bottle
i
was
overwhelmed
with
the
smell
of
cherry
cough
syrup
the
pour
was
ok
nice
hazy
reddish
amber
color
all
i
could
taste
was
artificial
cough
syrup
cherry
flavor
mouthfeel
seemed
ok
but
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
not
finish
d
looks
good
smells
good
but
this
beer
has
very
little
taste
to
it
it
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
very
slight
pink
tinge
lots
of
head
that
was
very
aromatic
no
mistaking
the
cherry
in
this
one
taste
was
almost
like
watereddown
cherry
koolaid
but
the
wheatiness
saved
it
from
tasting
flat
light
mouthfeel
that
still
feels
like
it
needs
to
be
savored
due
to
the
fruity
tones
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
no
hoppy
aftertaste
and
very
refreshing
this
would
be
fantastic
for
a
summer
beer
or
for
trying
to
get
fruity
cocktailloving
friends
into
beer
d
nice
cherry
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
very
good
for
a
fruit
flavored
beer
drinkability
i
was
expecting
the
worst
but
found
this
to
be
not
so
bad
its
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
only
have
the
two
it
would
take
too
long
to
drink
a
six
pack
as
i
quickly
get
tired
of
this
would
definitely
drink
more
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
beer
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
definately
cherry
almost
like
ludens
cough
drops
in
beer
form
which
can
be
a
plus
or
minus
depending
on
who
you
are
this
is
definately
an
easier
drink
to
have
but
in
no
means
is
any
form
of
a
manly
man
beer
but
its
good
however
for
fruit
beers
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
my
top
10
its
a
good
beer
to
try
out
but
after
2
the
taste
gets
alittle
too
much
for
me
now
dont
get
my
wrong
i
never
had
this
one
before
and
i
thought
it
would
good
i
just
wont
drink
it
again
but
the
thing
is
my
girlfriend
loved
it
d
no
problem
drinking
this
one
and
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
this
a
bit
as
well
though
the
cherry
might
be
overwhelming
after
a
couple
d
again
i
will
admit
i
am
normally
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
brew
however
the
bbc
has
done
a
good
job
for
the
style
as
the
cherry
flavor
isnt
overdone
and
its
actually
fairly
refreshing
brew
smells
almost
overpoweringly
of
cherry
but
personally
thats
fine
nice
color
and
head
with
decent
retention
the
taste
of
the
wheat
beer
mixed
perfectly
with
the
cherry
alot
of
fruit
beers
taste
too
much
of
beer
not
enough
of
fruit
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
balancing
the
two
leaves
a
fine
after
taste
and
mixes
well
with
most
kinds
of
foods
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
find
the
light
body
and
moderate
levels
of
carbonation
to
be
appropriate
for
this
style
nothing
too
special
in
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
backtoback
the
cherry
flavor
is
too
strong
overpowering
this
brew
is
more
juicelike
than
beerlike
this
is
one
fruit
beer
that
i
can
see
being
refreshing
on
an
extremely
hot
day
however
i
think
that
it
is
just
too
much
cherry
in
this
brew
for
it
to
be
drunk
on
any
other
type
of
day
ill
probably
not
be
buying
this
again
there
are
much
better
fruit
beers
out
there
this
beer
smells
like
a
cherry
bomb
i
guess
that
is
good
if
your
are
into
frutity
beers
or
whatever
but
its
not
really
for
me
the
taste
was
also
very
cherrific
however
i
did
notice
a
wheat
flavor
too
it
that
i
liked
somewhat
i
can
not
drink
sas
cranberry
lambic
but
this
is
i
can
stand
to
a
degree
or
two
it
finishes
secent
enough
and
has
a
an
alright
mouthfeel
not
my
first
choice
but
ok
samuel
adams
cherry
wheat
was
copper
in
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
had
decent
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
mostly
cherries
the
taste
was
cherries
with
some
light
malt
it
was
sweet
upfront
with
a
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkabilty
was
average
its
a
decent
beer
that
pairs
well
with
a
fruity
dessert
on
tap
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
golden
copper
color
with
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
flowing
in
the
glass
smell
is
of
strong
cherries
in
the
nose
also
a
bit
of
roasted
character
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
imo
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
it
has
a
malty
character
to
it
more
than
it
has
that
cherry
taste
it
was
very
good
and
a
bit
chewy
and
made
me
want
to
eat
a
good
meal
i
could
drink
this
on
tap
all
day
long
it
went
down
smooth
and
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
unlike
other
fruity
beers
that
i
could
only
tolerate
a
few
of
na
zdrowie
had
this
one
a
couple
years
back
and
wasnt
very
impressed
with
the
strong
cherry
flavor
without
much
else
appearance
is
ambercopper
color
a
little
bit
of
head
nose
is
all
cherry
taste
is
likewise
mostly
cherry
only
i
didnt
find
it
offensive
or
jarring
like
i
did
initially
although
the
buddy
of
mine
who
also
got
a
bottle
thought
it
was
crap
seriously
theres
not
much
else
i
can
say
about
the
flavor
other
than
that
it
is
fairly
fruity
and
sweet
almost
like
juice
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
not
particularly
complex
and
only
for
those
who
like
fruit
juice
pours
out
an
apricot
color
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
in
the
body
and
a
huge
creamy
head
with
dimples
all
along
the
top
as
the
head
slowly
recedes
it
leaves
thick
raised
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
big
punch
of
maraschino
cherries
with
some
backing
wheatiness
not
much
else
cherry
flavor
tastes
too
artificial
and
with
a
nutrasweet
like
flavor
the
wheat
and
grain
come
trough
a
bit
but
the
cherry
flavoring
is
too
much
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
fulsome
with
barely
any
carbonation
felt
on
the
tongue
despite
the
appearance
of
moderate
carbonation
too
flat
feeling
ill
manage
to
finish
the
bottle
but
it
will
be
reminiscent
of
a
chore
this
brew
poured
to
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
over
all
it
is
a
good
looking
brew
the
aroma
screams
cherries
to
be
frank
that
is
really
all
i
am
picking
up
they
give
off
a
very
sweet
scent
that
to
me
seems
too
much
the
flavor
again
seems
to
be
all
about
the
cherries
which
in
my
opinion
are
way
over
the
top
it
almost
has
a
cherry
coke
flavor
to
it
if
you
thought
the
nose
had
a
strong
cherry
presence
you
havent
seen
anything
yet
i
suppose
that
some
folks
might
enjoy
such
a
brew
but
the
cherry
flavor
seems
to
be
way
out
of
balance
with
a
slight
artificial
taste
to
me
this
one
is
not
a
keeper
would
like
to
have
something
different
in
the
summer
mix
pack
this
beer
pours
a
light
pale
color
aroma
is
similar
to
cherry
coke
and
cherries
in
general
which
isnt
bad
because
it
does
live
up
to
its
name
in
aroma
the
taste
has
a
strong
cherry
essence
with
some
hints
of
wheat
in
the
background
again
perhaps
too
sweet
or
too
heavy
on
the
strawberry
still
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
feel
is
worthier
than
other
styles
attempted
by
sa
taste
seems
tailored
to
foofoo
fruit
alcopop
drinkers
theres
a
sort
of
cherry
bubblegum
over
top
of
cherry
frosted
slightly
undercooked
cherry
cake
hops
who
knows
wheat
could
be
anywhere
the
flavor
isnt
offputting
but
its
almost
as
if
the
brewery
aimed
to
make
liquid
confectionaries
a
silly
laughable
beer
that
im
almost
embarassed
to
have
tried
ok
this
one
was
bad
bad
bad
tastes
like
discount
cherry
soda
mixed
with
beer
or
cough
drops
sam
adams
was
6
bucks
a
6
pack
if
you
bought
two
6
packs
so
i
picked
up
a
case
of
this
stuff
i
would
have
rather
had
spent
that
6
bucks
on
a
40
of
old
english
800
yes
this
beer
is
that
bad
if
you
want
something
fruity
buy
cider
or
a
malt
beverage
like
smirnoff
ice
this
beer
should
not
exist
drinkability
nice
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
pours
a
fourfinger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
bodied
and
light
carbonation
strong
cherry
nose
flavor
is
all
cherry
and
no
wheat
clean
finish
1
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
overall
not
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
cherry
flavor
versus
aroma
and
stronger
hops
and
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
by
my
standards
the
wheat
notes
are
more
evident
in
the
sip
than
the
smell
especially
in
the
aftertaste
although
a
bit
cloying
in
the
finish
and
the
whole
thing
is
masked
in
strong
fake
cherry
syrup
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
keeps
this
beer
tolerable
i
could
see
drinking
one
as
a
change
of
pace
or
on
a
hot
day
but
probably
wouldnt
look
for
a
sixer
too
sweet
and
unnatural
tasting
before
i
drank
beer
i
remember
having
a
roomate
who
raved
that
this
was
his
favorite
beer
and
he
truly
missed
it
after
having
stopped
drinking
for
a
while
so
ive
wanted
to
try
it
and
ive
stumbled
across
a
freebie
so
here
goes
its
a
pale
color
when
a
foamy
head
and
is
slightly
cloudy
due
to
the
lessthan
filtered
wheat
style
im
assuming
looks
good
smells
really
delicious
like
a
fruit
beer
should
and
was
appealing
to
those
who
arent
beer
purists
in
particular
as
it
smells
legitimately
fruity
i
dug
the
aroma
of
cherrys
being
so
strong
and
not
seeming
too
artificial
the
taste
tough
up
front
its
good
but
right
away
i
taste
medicinal
cherry
cough
syrup
i
cant
taste
anything
else
after
that
either
its
tart
and
not
a
sugar
bomb
but
not
noticably
hoppy
its
hard
to
want
to
call
this
a
beer
to
be
honest
youll
love
it
or
youll
hate
it
as
is
not
all
that
beer
like
which
is
not
necessarily
a
negative
but
in
taste
alone
thinking
of
it
as
a
desert
drink
i
couldnt
enjoy
this
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
not
watery
or
lightbeer
like
but
nothing
full
as
other
wheat
beers
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
honestly
unless
there
was
absolutely
nothing
else
around
and
i
imagine
there
would
be
long
periods
of
time
between
sips
to
help
me
forget
just
how
medicinal
it
is
only
to
take
another
sip
remember
and
not
come
back
to
it
for
a
while
or
put
it
down
unfinished
ymmv
but
i
cant
get
into
it
nice
try
sam
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
artificial
cherry
notes
may
start
to
get
to
you
after
a
couple
or
three
this
beer
pours
a
honey
clear
brown
with
many
bubbles
the
thick
white
foam
head
lasts
a
long
time
never
fully
disappearing
leaving
think
lacing
behind
the
small
is
too
sweet
it
smells
like
cherry
syrup
with
only
a
subtle
hint
of
beer
at
all
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
great
not
too
sweet
and
with
only
a
hint
of
cherries
the
mouth
feel
is
full
but
not
creamy
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
bubbles
are
not
really
present
in
the
mouth
feel
that
much
i
am
normally
opposed
to
the
idea
of
fruity
beers
but
this
one
was
done
very
nicely
the
smell
is
really
sweet
however
the
flavor
is
not
too
sweet
unlike
some
other
fruity
beers
you
can
still
taste
the
beers
in
this
sam
adams
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
a
lot
just
because
you
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
it
i
do
know
that
others
simply
love
this
beer
so
if
you
have
not
tried
it
for
yourself
you
should
especially
if
you
can
find
a
single
as
i
did
when
poured
it
had
a
golden
carmel
color
with
a
white
rocky
head
that
left
nice
lacing
it
has
a
strong
sweet
cherry
odor
and
once
you
can
get
past
that
you
actually
can
smell
the
wheat
the
cherry
taste
was
not
as
strong
as
the
smell
and
i
could
taste
the
wheat
not
my
favorite
flavor
im
not
a
big
fruit
beer
drinker
i
have
had
the
boisenberry
wheat
from
the
sam
adams
homebrew
collection
and
i
thought
that
was
a
better
beer
cherry
wheat
is
a
smooth
beer
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
i
put
average
for
drinkability
because
i
think
it
is
what
it
is
i
taste
cherry
and
i
taste
wheat
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
see
how
others
might
enjoy
this
definitely
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
really
refreshing
out
on
the
patio
flavor
is
more
of
the
cherry
no
hop
presence
or
real
malt
backbone
its
a
little
thin
and
watery
the
malt
isnt
too
great
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
quite
sweet
unique
and
tasty
not
to
sugary
a
little
diacetyl
but
a
very
solid
fruit
beer
overall
first
i
would
like
to
say
im
not
a
real
big
fan
of
sam
adams
beers
and
i
have
seen
this
beer
many
times
and
have
passed
it
up
i
was
very
leery
to
buy
it
but
i
was
surprised
and
glad
i
did
poured
a
honey
amber
color
with
a
three
finger
off
white
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
patchy
lace
to
the
finish
nice
fruity
cherry
aromas
with
a
taste
of
maraschino
cherrys
sweet
but
not
cloying
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
medium
and
smooth
and
carbonation
is
ok
drank
five
for
the
review
and
enjoyed
every
one
it
goes
down
like
water
making
this
a
beer
to
drink
a
steamy
summer
day
when
youre
too
hot
to
really
pay
too
much
attention
to
what
youre
drinking
overall
this
is
a
beer
made
with
nonbeerdrinkers
in
mind
the
cherry
flavor
overpowers
the
beer
flavor
but
its
still
not
a
bad
beer
feels
a
bit
thick
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
have
liked
probably
will
not
intentionally
have
again
but
will
drink
it
this
beer
starts
with
a
4
finger
head
that
goes
away
after
a
while
the
smell
is
very
strong
of
cherry
which
i
guess
is
the
point
but
is
almost
overpowering
it
almost
tastes
like
a
a
cross
between
a
wheat
beer
and
a
melted
cherry
slushy
its
hard
to
reallly
describe
the
taste
its
a
must
try
if
only
to
understand
the
flavor
i
agree
with
the
last
reviewer
that
this
beer
is
probably
for
nonbeer
drinkers
or
those
who
like
lambic
beers
i
personally
am
not
fond
of
the
cherry
flavor
either
but
its
definatly
a
different
and
interesting
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
of
cherries
but
i
had
heard
good
things
about
his
beer
so
i
gave
it
a
try
first
off
the
artificial
cherry
smell
has
got
to
go
whether
you
like
cherries
or
not
if
the
cherries
arent
enough
to
make
it
into
the
aroma
the
beer
shouldnt
have
to
smell
like
koolaid
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
but
i
think
it
is
definitely
one
for
nonbeer
drinkers
this
beer
would
have
been
much
better
without
the
cherries
this
is
well
below
samuel
adams
standards
drinkability
above
average
drinkability
the
beer
tastes
and
smells
good
but
its
one
to
be
drank
in
small
doses
hurray
for
cherry
beer
not
the
greatest
but
definitely
not
bad
refreshing
and
fairly
light
i
like
that
it
is
not
red
i
e
no
food
coloring
same
cherry
taste
as
a
kriek
but
without
the
sweetness
much
drier
wheat
cant
find
it
but
really
what
you
would
expect
from
a
cherry
beer
although
the
cherry
is
really
present
the
taste
still
is
that
of
beer
rather
than
fruit
i
like
it
this
one
would
work
very
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
im
impressed
that
he
cherry
taste
can
be
so
dominant
without
leaving
a
sticky
sweetness
in
your
mouth
d
i
enjoyed
the
combination
of
wheat
ale
and
cherry
and
overall
i
would
suggest
this
drink
for
those
who
prefer
to
be
experimental
in
their
beer
selection
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
enough
slightly
filling
i
thought
this
beer
wouldnt
be
that
great
considering
how
bad
the
cranberry
lambic
is
but
ill
admit
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
within
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
if
there
were
something
else
available
especially
since
a
given
place
that
would
have
this
beer
ontap
will
typically
have

adams

others

cherry
wheat
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
strong
cherry
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
maraschino
cherry
the
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
it
is
not
cloyingly
sweet
as
the
aroma
might
suggest
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
strong
and
the
finish
is
all
wheat
which
i
like
in
this
type
of
beer
this
isnt
really
my
thing
but
i
think
its
a
bit
better
than
average
but
not
outstanding
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
and
fluffy
white
head
surprisingly
good
retention
and
lacing
large
and
sweet
aromas
of
cherry
floats
to
the
nose
and
not
much
else
cherry
taste
is
more
subdued
than
in
the
aroma
cherries
and
cream
comes
to
mind
theres
also
a
bit
of
grain
and
wheat
but
the
cherry
flavor
dominates
overall
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
i
found
this
sessionable
but
certainly
more
so
in
the
summertime
but
still
a
good
go
for
one
or
two
during
winter
very
drinkable
beer
and
again
highly
reccommended
a
nice
fun
enjoyable
beer
that
seems
like
it
can
go
with
anything
however
it
seems
more
like
a
summer
beer
since
it
is
lighter
in
character
so
i
reccommend
waiting
for
the
temperature
to
rise
for
this
brew
to
be
at
its
finest
cheers2beers
pours
a

with

by
ripe
sweet

with
fresh

in

taste
is
similar
to
the

but
more
subdued
the
cherry

also
offers
some

not

in

an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beerwould
be
nice
in
the
summer
drinkability
this
beer
grew
very
tiring
on
the
tastebuds
as
the
glass
emptied
select
any
other
sa
beer
for
a
more
satisfying
session
would
i
buy
this
agian
maybe
it
went
well
with
the
dinner
and
the
roommates
all
seemed
to
enjoy
it
drinkability
a
refreshing
fruit
flavored
beer
i
poured
this
one
from
the
bottle
into
a
cylinder
glass
just
to
see
if
that
would
give
it
a
little
something
extra
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
large
head
maybe
just
from
the
glass
smells
a
bit
like
cherry
cough
syrup
not
really
pleasing
but
not
horrible
tastes
just
like
it
smell
no
hint
of
hops
i
know
its
cherry
wheat
but
i
got
all
cherry
and
no
wheat
overall
not
sam
adams
finest
offering
the
jury
is
still
out
on
this
one
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
fruit
beer
and
after
i
have
tried
a
few
more
ill
come
back
and
review
it
again
its
not
awful
but
it
definitely
is
not
my
favorite
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
would
have
been
better
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
overall
an
overly
sweet
fruit
beer
nothing
remarkable
this
is
the
first
fruit
beer
i
have
had
so
perhaps
this
style
may
not
be
for
me
or
there
are
far
superior
examples
out
there
i
just
need
to
try
this
just
seemed
like
drinking
seltzer
with
cherry
flavoring
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
of
cherry
was
very
overpowering
and
i
could
smell
it
far
away
from
the
glass
it
didnt
smell
like
natural
cherries
do
more
like
the
artificial
cherry
flavored
stuff
the
initial
taste
is
very
much
like
any
other
wheat
beer
but
that
soon
was
completely
replaced
by
the
cherry
flavor
the
cherries
tasted
much
more
natural
than
they
smelled
and
although
it
was
definitely
the
dominant
flavor
it
did
not
overpower
the
beer
the
finish
was
very
mellow
and
silky
if
you
like
cherries
this
will
be
a
good
beer
for
you
but
it
just
didnt
taste
enough
like
a
regular
old
beer
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
consistent
basis
i
think
if
perhaps
the
wheat
had
more
of
a
role
here
i
would
like
it
a
lot
more
instead
it
comes
across
as
a
fruity
concoction
that
leaves
the
grain
lost
and
thin
in
fact
the
overall
feel
is
almost
of
one
of
those
ubiquitous
malt
beverages
and
i
somehow
doubt
this
is
what
bbc
was
going
for
on
the
flip
side
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
as
the
sweetness
is
controlled
enough
to
be
crisped
a
bit
in
the
finish
making
it
refreshing
in
its
way
this
was
the
main
offering
at
a
friends
home
during
the
eagles
dismantling
of
the
giants
and
i
talked
to
him
about
maybe
steering
clear
of
the
fruity
brews
and
certainly
this
one
this
one
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
tall
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
very
strong
mostly
cherries
with
some
sweet
notes
the
taste
is
very
similar
very
sweet
and
strong
the
cherries
dominate
this
beer
not
much
else
comes
out
in
this
beer
it
is
one
dimentional
but
if
you
like
that
aspect
you
are
set
i
see
this
beer
as
a
love
it
or
hate
it
i
happen
to
love
it
it
is
an
easy
drinker
with
a
smooth
crisp
mouthfeel
even
though
the
cherry
taste
is
strong
it
doesnt
get
annoying
for
me
as
far
as
fruit
beers
this
is
my
favorite
i
hope
you
like
it
as
much
as
i
do
enjoy
this
brew
pours
into
my
pint
glass
a
golden
color
with
fair
clarity
a
white
head
developed
but
rather
quickly
diminished
into
a
thin
but
long
lasting
skim
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
no
surprise
cherries
actually
smelled
like
maraschino
cherries
the
smell
was
dominating
and
powerful
but
pleasant
there
were
no
real
strong
malt
or
hop
aromas
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
of
graininess
and
wheat
taste
and
a
lot
of
cherry
the
hop
bitterness
combined
with
any
acidity
from
the
cherries
gives
the
beer
a
nice
balance
by
the
smell
i
expected
an
overlysweet
brew
but
found
something
more
balanced
than
i
expected
no
real
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
but
that
was
expected
the
carbonation
was
moderate
body
was
mediumfull
and
had
a
nice
smoothness
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
the
handful
of
times
ive
entered
the
fruit
beer
realm
i
often
left
unsatisfied
but
this
one
is
a
keeper
the
aroma
is
wonderful
especially
if
you
like
maraschino
cherries
which
i
do
the
flavor
was
much
more
balanced
and
beerlike
than
i
expected
with
the
powerful
cherry
aroma
the
beer
was
also
quite
smooth
and
finished
with
just
about
the
perfect
amount
of
tartness
this
beer
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
head
that
slowly
faded
the
smell
had
aromas
of
wheat
and
a
cherries
the
flavor
had
a
medium
body
of
wheat
with
a
relatively
strong
flavor
of
cherries
the
hop
profile
was
very
light
in
all
aspects
the
mouthfeel
was
relatively
crisp
with
a
medium
carbonation
i
felt
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
unique
for
its
taste
however
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
alot
of
them
its
worth
a
try
though
appearance
is
cloudy
no
head
strong
really
strong
aroma
of
maraschino
cherries
which
is
nice
but
doesnt
come
out
nearly
as
much
in
the
taste
body
is
well
carbonated
but
flavour
is
quite
flat
the
cherry
flavour
is
too
sweet
for
beer
the
maraschino
cherry
anyways
i
might
suggest
a
different
type
of
cherry
this
seems
more
like
it
should
belong
to
a
mixed
cooler
flavour
can
come
across
as
artificial
at
times
though
it
is
well
fitted
into
the
beer
and
stays
well
rounded
overall
this
beer
was
a
fun
one
but
i
dont
think
it
quite
works
too
sweet
a
flavour
and
yet
not
nearly
enough
taste
somewhat
below
par
for
what
it
should
be
one
of
these
is
enough
for
me
its
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
not
a
good
call
for
this
one
the
drinkability
is
not
good
i
will
not
try
this
offering
again
mk
overall
this
would
probably
taste
better
on
a
summer
afternoon
than
on
a
winters
evening
like
this
one
but
its
still
better
than
i
expected
if
you
like
fruit
beers
this
ones
worth
a
shot
one
of
my
absolute
favorities
as
i
feel
thats
its
rare
for
a
beer
to
be
made
into
exactly
what
it
was
intended
to
be
as
much
so
as
cherry
wheat
the
cherry
taste
here
is
just
wonderful
at
the
start
with
enough
carbonation
to
really
set
it
off
somehow
the
sam
cherries
manage
to
tast
better
than
your
typical
cherry
the
finish
is
stronger
on
the
wheat
flavor
and
is
extremely
clean
almost
everyone
i
know
enjoys
this
even
if
they
arent
typically
into
craft
beers
notes
i
found
this
really
enjoyable
i
could
see
this
as
a
nice
daytime
brew
and
quenching
enough
for
hot
weather
its
not
good
or
bad
it
just
is
basically
tastes
like
cherry
on
a
triscuit
theres
a
strong
sweet
cherry
flavor
on
top
of
white
american
wheat
smells
of
mostly
cherries
with
a
little
wheat
not
really
my
taste
but
if
youre
a
beer
noob
or
into
fruit
beer
its
worth
a
shot
some
of
my
friends
that
enjoy
craft
beer
also
love
this
stuff
so
it
cant
be
too
bad
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
in
my
opinion
artificial
flavoring
or
not
i
guess
some
people
find
it
too
sweet
this
one
goes
well
after
a
dinner
as
a
good
dessert
beer
cherries
tast
a
little
artificial
mouthfeel
is
very
lively
the
cherry
taste
is
a
little
sour
not
too
sweet
and
dominates
the
entire
taste
profile
cherries
are
faded
out
by
a
grainy
dryness
brew
is
thin
though
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
more
robust
malt
bill
to
stand
up
to
these
cherries
more
wheat
character
as
well
i
think
more
prominent
characteristics
of
a
traditional
amber
ale
to
accompany
cherries
would
improve
this
one
but
very
refreshing
and
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
my
criticism
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
though
i
really
like
the
combination
but
it
i
think
it
could
be
done
better
it
is
good
though
and
highly
drinkable
fairly
refreshing
but
very
strong
cherry
flavor
also
too
much
of
this
gives
me
terrible
headaches
despite
the
refreshing
nature
of
the
body
the
oatmeallike
sensation
doesnt
lend
itself
to
continuous
consumption
two
or
three
tops
and
youre
done
but
then
again
as
we
all
respect
beer
we
would
never
drink
more
than
that
anyway
would
we
you
can
tell
there
is
a
good
beer
hiding
somewhere
in
here
but
it
is
overpowered
by
the
other
factors
i
mentioned
its
in
no
way
bad
but
even
for
a
fruit
beer
it
is
a
bit
lacking
if
you
really
like
cherry
colas
with
a
mild
wheat
aftertaste
then
by
all
means
enjoy
its
worth
a
try
but
having
a
few
in
a
row
wont
be
as
easy
this
wont
prejudice
me
in
the
future
i
will
stay
open
served
at
40
deg
in
a
pint
glass
light
amber
color
almost
neutral
aroma
save
a
very
faint
aroma
of
cheeries
the
taste
was
a
refreshing
blend
of
a
mild
wheat
ale
and
fresh
cherries
i
was
surprised
on
how
well
balanced
this
was
both
the
middle
and
finish
were
smooth
and
there
was
only
a
moderate
aftertaste
which
led
to
some
subtraction
in
dinkability
points
not
a
bad
brew
if
you
are
into
fruit
ales
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
brew
and
i
gave
it
a
3
5
in
the
taste
department
just
for
that
fact
although
i
wouldnt
care
for
another
first
off
it
looked
and
smelled
great
from
the
first
sip
you
get
blasted
with
the
cherry
flavor
with
a
mild
wheat
taste
but
its
all
about
the
cherries
with
this
one
i
guess
what
your
left
with
is
a
candylike
beer
that
leaves
a
sugary
feeling
in
your
mouth
and
its
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
cough
drop
medicinelike
cherry
taste
by
the
end
of
your
bottle
interesting
but
awkward
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
feb
07
freshness
date
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
it
is
sweet
and
mild
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
in
this
beer
drinkers
opinion
it
reminds
me
of
the
warrant
video
cherry
pie
for
some
odd
reason
it
goes
great
with
cheese
pretzels
and
i
would
imagine
dessert
highly
drinkable
highly
recommended
at
first
i
didnt
think
i
would
be
able
to
drink
many
of
these
however
after
one
and
a
half
or
so
and
my
palate
getting
used
to
the
sweet
cherry
overload
its
not
very
hard
to
drink
at
all
perhaps
thats
because
it
is
pretty
watery
and
weak
with
that
said
its
not
a
bad
a
beer
to
buy
at
a
place
that
only
carries
macros
the
big
imports
sam
adams
and
the
like
but
it
definitely
leaves
something
to
be
desired
something
that
reminds
you
while
youre
drinking
oh
yeah
this
is
beer
im
drinking
these
go
down
real
nice
i
will
continue
to
have
this
on
my
short
list
of
beers
to
keep
in
stock
overall
ive
had
this
several
times
over
the
years
and
each
time
i
come
back
thinking
that
ill
like
it
but
one
glass
of
this
and
im
set
a
nice
break
once
in
a
while
but
just
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
definitely
not
a
session
brew
im
going
to
spring
one
of
these
on
my
girlfiriend
tonight
at
dinner
i
think
that
she
will
realy
like
it
i
personally
enjoy
the
novelty
of
a
cherry
beer
but
it
has
essentially
zero
complexity
and
its
really
a
mediocre
beer
the
bbc
has
yet
to
impress
me
with
its
fruit
characteristics
in
any
of
its
beers
like
the
gorgeous
girl
at
the
party
whose
favorite
song
is
the
new
chingy
single
this
is
darn
good
looking
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
live
with
it
tasted
090706
da
perhaps
this
is
just
not
my
syle
drinkability
not
a
bad
offering
from
samuel
adams
i
would
recomend
a
try
or
two
to
someone
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
orangered
translucent
body
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
head
and
decent
lacing
onedimensional
aroma
cherry
cherry
dominates
flavor
with
some
malt
and
yeast
if
i
were
bigger
on
cherries
id
probably
like
it
better
my
only
real
complaint
about
this
beer
is
its
lack
of
complexity
but
its
a
tasty
mediumboddied
pleasant
little
beer
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
usually
have
one
of
these
for
every
34
drinks
a
very
good
fruit
beer
and
to
be
honest
its
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
thus
far
d
i
enjoyed
this
far
more
than
i
thought
i
would
a
refreshing
uncomplicated
beer
just
calling
it
cherry
wheat
is
a
pretty
functional
definition
because
i
didnt
find
too
many
other
flavors
hiding
in
this
one
gets
an
average
drinkability
because
it
was
less
enjoyable
when
i
poured
the
second
bottle
as
always
scores
are
within
the
style
pours
goldamber
with
a
huge
head
which
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
surface
the
whole
way
down
smells
like
swee
cherries
cherry
coke
taste
is
sweet
cherries
with
some
wheat
tanginess
fairly
balanced
actually
not
overly
sweet
medium
to
full
bodied
i
find
this
a
bit
cloying
its
okay
but
more
of
a
beer
for
nonbeer
drinkers
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
crisp
an
easy
beer
to
knock
back
a
lot
of
pours
a
straw
color
maybe
a
hint
of
pink
in
the
edges
minimal
white
head
aroma
is
a
bit
sweet
slight
cherry
notes
flavor
is
a
light
bodied
american
wheat
with
a
harsh
almost
sour
artificial
cherry
flavor
its
almost
overpowering
and
leaves
just
a
slight
metallic
tinge
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
thin
drinkability
its
been
years
since
i
tried
this
beer
now
i
remember
why
got
a
sixer
of
this
for
my
girlfriend
id
had
it
before
and
remembered
not
likeing
it
but
decided
to
try
it
again
pours
a
straw
color
with
the
slightest
red
tint
the
head
is
about
one
finger
width
smell
is
dominated
by
cherry
with
some
wheat
malt
and
not
any
noticable
hops
taste
is
overly
dominated
by
cherry
the
wheat
malt
plays
less
of
role
in
the
taste
as
i
would
have
expected
i
can
only
detect
the
a
slight
amount
of
hops
mouth
is
not
as
carbinated
as
i
would
have
wanted
in
a
wheat
beer
the
thickness
of
the
beer
is
ok
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
however
my
girlfriend
loves
it
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
with
an
interesting
flavor
and
aroma
but
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
of
a
novelty
the
cherry
flavor
is
a
bit
too
much
and
it
no
longer
tastes
like
a
beer
i
like
fruit
flavors
in
beers
and
i
like
lambics
and
such
but
something
here
just
seems
contrived
and
artificial
a
beer
trying
to
taste
like
fruit
certainly
worth
giving
a
try
but
you
probably
wont
see
the
need
to
try
another
taste
is
lightly
sweet
lightly
sour
cherries
crisp
lightly
sour
wheat
malt
light
body
sweet
aftertaste
pretty
good
for
a
fruit
beer
not
overdone
or
syrupy
sweet
pours
a
nice
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
and
decent
retention
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
definately
has
a
distinct
cherry
smell
to
it
followed
by
a
malty
smell
this
beer
has
a
very
strong
taste
of
cherry
as
the
name
would
imply
which
i
actually
find
to
be
too
strong
there
is
also
a
fruity
then
wheaty
taste
to
it
but
it
is
killed
by
the
cherry
went
down
easy
then
wanted
to
come
back
up
because
of
the
taste
of
cherry
i
kept
burping
up
overall
not
a
big
fan
im
stunned
that
this
beer
is
still
around
but
i
guess
some
people
do
like
it
there
is
obvious
cherry
on
the
nose
as
well
as
in
the
body
but
its
too
strong
of
a
sour
flavor
that
doesnt
identify
as
cherry
you
need
to
either
go
more
cherry
or
more
subtle
this
jsut
doesnt
balance
well
i
find
find
the
hops
playing
a
major
role
here
either
and
i
dont
relate
to
this
as
a
wheat
beer
it
looks
too
clean
and
doesnt
taste
refreshing
i
find
it
a
challenge
to
drink
more
than
one
overall
a
very
nice
fruity
beer
another
fine
product
from
the
samuel
adams
company
it
is
very
good
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
or
beach
in
my
opinion
as
well
girls
who
are
skiddish
about
beer
like
this
one
because
of
the
sweet
fruity
flavour
but
i
say
cherry
cherry
in
your
treejump
down
on
the
ground
and
make
a
pie
with
me
all
right
so
those
are
obscure
lyrics
but
this
is
a
serious
fruit
beer
a
wild
dose
of
cherry
extract
and
a
toastiness
that
conjures
up
the
taste
of
those
cherry
cordial
cakes
that
come
in
a
box
of
eight
for
1
50
you
may
have
foolhardy
tastebuds
and
think
otherwise
and
that
is
your
right
as
an
orangutanamerican
just
dont
get
all
persnickety
with
me
when
i
tell
you
that
this
is
a
top
shelf
cosmobrew
space
helmet
not
included
12
oz
bottle
best
by
1006
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
pumpkin
with
medium
visible
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
of
small
bubbles
that
retains
a
14
cap
and
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
tartsweet
cherries
and
cranberries
with
wheat
and
a
faint
nuttytoasty
aroma
it
tastes
like
cherries
with
wheat
and
lemon
and
a
low
hop
flavor
maybe
some
green
hops
with
a
low
bitterness
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
with
sufficient
carbonation
and
leaves
a
light
finish
overall
an
interesting
change
of
pace
but
not
something
id
make

session

out
of

is
cherries
all
the
way
but
not
like
fresh
cherries
more
like
a
jar
of
marrachino
cherries
it
is
really
too
overbearing
taste
is
not
so
bad
but
the
aroma
really
takes
over
before
you
can
even
get
the
beer
into
your
mouth
i
actually
had
to
hold
my
nose
and
take
a
drink
just
to
get
a
better
taste
of
the
beer
without
the
aroma
taste
is
also
cherries
but
much
more
muted
than
the
smell
you
get
a
bit
more
of
the
crisp
flavor
from
the
malts
and
a
bit
of
spicyness
from
the
hops
overall
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
it
smells
like
they
just
poured
jars
of
marachino
cherries
into
the
fermenter
and
although
the
flavor
was
not
bad
i
would
need
to
drink
this
with
a
straw
to
really
get
any
enjoyment
from
it
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
like
the
cherry
flavoring
from
cherry
coke
the
taste
is
also
cherry
sweetness
from
the
artificial
cherry
flavoring
but
it
is
quite
good
it
is
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
still
good
overall
highly
drinkable
for
a
fruit
beer
i
dont
know
about
as
a
wheat
beer
but
good
this
is
probably
a
like
it
or
leave
it
kind
of
beer
depending
on
whether
you
like
cherries
in
beer
for
me
i
think
it
makes
a
good
summer
drinker
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
maybe
not
one
i
would
drink
often
i
also
think
it
might
appeal
to
those
who
are
less
inclinced
to
the
flavor
of
beer
from
the
bottle
pour
a
honey
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
maschinos
cherries
wheat
just
a
hint
of
malt
flavor
those
maschinos
cherries
and
malts
come
out
nice
and
strong
along
with
a
cola
like
flavor
and
a
nice
bitterness
i
think
this
will
be
a
good
summer
evening
beer
sitting
on
the
deck
by
the
fire
pit
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
that
hot
july
day
after
doing
some
yard
work
or
just
relaxing
in
the
summer
sun
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
i
dont
have
a
very
pleasant
memory
of
this
beer
from
a
bottle
back
in
college
but
getting
it
on
tap
on
this
warm
evening
was
a
great
surprise
this
beer
doesnt
really
feel
like
a
wheat
beer
and
is
almost
more
of
a
light
dessert
because
it
smells
just
like
my
mothers
cherry
piedelicious
not
at
all
heavy
in
the
mouth
or
overpowering
with
cherry
flavor
but
is
rather
a
simply
stated
surprise
of
a
fruit
beer
not
anything
i
would
want
in
the
winter
months
but
this
could
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
craft
beer
as
is
the
case
with
a
number
of
sam
adams
beers
this
presentation
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
increased
my
rating
significantly
overall
i
have
bought
two
or
three
six
packs
of
this
beer
over
the
last
two
years
i
am
enamored
with
the
idea
of
cherry
wheat
though
it
could
be
done
better
still
it
is
a
solid
effort
good
but
not
great
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
good
i
like
the
fakeish
cherry
flavor
and
the
sweetness
doesnt
tend
to
stick
around
which
makes
it
better
cheers
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
quickly
fading
head
the
cloudiness
is
from
the
yeast
activated
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottom
because
of
a
quick
swirl
the
smell
really
does
smell
like
the
filling
from
a
cherry
pie
taste
is
dry
and
crisp
with
slight
notes
of
cherry
and
wheat
i
did
somewhat
enjoy
the
smell
of
this
brew
but
the
taste
was
not
to
my
liking
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
the
flavor
of
this
beer
and
it
was
hard
to
finish
the
whole
thing
actually
there
was
just
something
about
that
cherry
flavor
that
did
not
sit
well
with
me
glad
i
picked
up
a
single
and
not
a
sixer
drinkability
not
sure
if
you
can
drink
a
lot
in
an
evening
becasue
there
is
too
much
fruit
but
great
finisher
the
beer
pours
a
light
slightly
cloudy
copper
color
the
offwhite
head
is
very
foamy
about
1
12
inches
and
sticks
around
a
while
with
lots
of
lace
it
smells
like
sweet
cherries
more
cherrycoke
like
than
anything
else
i
couldnt
really
smell
anything
else
other
than
the
cherries
it
tastes
like
cherry
too
but
its
not
a
strong
flavor
theres
a
grainywheat
taste
in
there
too
but
like
the
cherry
taste
its
not
strong
at
all
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
either
the
beer
smells
better
than
it
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
overall
im
not
impressed
i
usually
like
samuel
adams
beers
but
this
offering
is
very
average
id
drink
it
again
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
for
free
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
beer
again
theres
many
more
beers
i
would
rather
spend
my
money
on
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
the
appearance
is
just
average
copper
color
w
little
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
its
cherry
all
the
way
tastes
a
little
sweet
w
a
bitter
finish
not
bad
but
definitely
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
or
often
at
all
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
though
super
easy
drinking
and
something
that
i
might
enjoy
on
a
scorching
hot
afternoon
the
taste
is
mostly
cherry
with
some
malts
and
hops
in
the
back
end
i
detected
a
small
amount
of
hop
bitterness
which
rounds
off
the
taste
nicely
to
me
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
light
tasting
beer
i
recommend
it
drinkability
refreshing
aside
from
the
slight
cough
syrup
flavor
i
drank
it
but
i
would
rather
have
the
lindemans
kriek
lambic
if
i
wanted
this
style
this
tasted
like
a
cherry
soda
not
bad
but
nothing
special
not
the
best
from
boston
brewery
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
a
definite
improvement
over
what
it
tasted
like
at
least
to
me
in
the
past
i
give
it
points
for
appearance
and
mouthfeel
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
suppose
i
could
put
down
a
couple
around
the
barbecue
but
i
dont
quite
think
sam
adams
nailed
what
a
really
good
cherry
wheat
could
be
enjoy
poured
into
my
trusty
0
4
liter
chalice
it
has
a
nice
head
that
dissapates
quickly
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
pours
to
a
rusty
yellow
hue
the
smell
is
very
cherry
smells
like
juicyjuice
cherry
in
fact
taste
starts
with
the
tartness
of
cherry
followed
by
a
brauny
wheat
carbonation
is
airy
finish
is
more
tartness
i
like
the
middle
taste
with
wheat
and
hint
of
cherry
but
the
front
end
and
back
end
are
a
little
too
sweet
very
different
i
guess
it
would
make
a
great
dessert
beer
off
the
wall
something
i
would
serve
as
a
conversation
piece
but
wouldnt
really
drink
in
any
quantity
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
decent
whitish
head
and
ok
stringy
lacing
nose
has
wheat
hints
thought
i
picked
up
banana
hints
when
colder
but
now
just
a
kind
of
junky
cherry
thing
going
on
taste
is
similar
a
decent
wheat
malt
in
front
but
i
just
dont
like
the
marachino
cherry
thing
it
has
going
on
bordering
on
the
comical
like
cough
syrup
or
cherry
flouride
just
isnt
balanced
out
right
too
much
cherry
when
cold
or
warm
first
sip
and
last
mouth
is
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
creamy
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
a
bit
of
spring
this
is
a
desert
beer
if
anything
but
not
one
id
buy
again
sorry
sam
not
your
best
work
a
tasty
beer
that
is
perfect
for
dessert
certainly
not
a
beer
for
everyone
but
if
you
love
the
taste
of
maraschino
cherry
then
this
beer
is
for
you
very
nice
smell
poured
a
nice
head
that
mostly
went
away
in
2
minutes
but
a
bit
stayed
obviously
a
taste
of
cherries
but
with
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
love
it
without
the
cherries
near
perfect
carbonation
great
beer
to
drink
only
planned
on
having
3
but
drank
the
entire
sixer
anytime
i
see
this
stuff
ill
grab
one
very
delicious
having
read
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
would
also
recommend
drinking
it
on
tap
rather
than
from
the
bottle
sam
adams
usually
makes
winning
beers
this
does
not
fall
into
the
category
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
which
is
the
best
part
of
it
smells
like
saccharin
and
those
cherries
you
get
on
ice
cream
sundaes
taste
well
like
those
candy
cherries
and
robitussen
its
quite
nasty
at
least
the
taste
doesnt
linger
mouthfeel
so
what
drinkability
well
if
you
close
your
nose
and
gulp
it
you
can
finish
it
quickly
what
pisses
me
off
big
time
is
that
this
crap
is
easy
to
find
yet
the
double
bock
is
damn
near
impossible
to
find
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you
people
i
must
say
this
is
a
totally
different
brew
in
a
glass
i
reviewed
this
when
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
it
tasted
like
cherry
soda
when
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
now
i
believe
i
was
tasting
the
aroma
it
certainly
smells
like
cherry
soda
but
tastes
nothing
like
it
it
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
headfilm
the
smell
is
amazing
almondycherry
tastes
like
almonds
hint
of
cherry
and
water
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
leaving
an
almond
aftertaste
it
is
light
and
drinkable
but
then
again
i
really
cant
rate
on
drinkability
i
drank
1
bottle
of
chimay
blue
delerium
tremens
and
a
bottle
of
fort
in
1
night
so
its
summer
here
and
i
have
been
drinking
alto
of
wheat
here
we
go
on
the
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
itself
was
a
amber
color
darker
than
most
wheats
with
slight
red
and
orange
hints
the
head
was
a
large34
inch
creamy
whiteslight
pink
hints
also
present
that
took
a
while
to
diminish
lots
of
white
lace
left
from
the
head
all
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
this
beer
almost
does
not
smell
like
a
beer
it
is
exactly
what
it
says
a
cherry
wheat
there
is
a
strong
smell
of
sweet
cherrylots
of
cherry
and
i
cant
stress
that
enough
and
lots
of
sweet
malt
the
beer
itself
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
it
smells
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
and
cherries
present
in
the
forefront
of
the
body
but
it
finishes
surprisingly
crisp
with
just
a
light
bit
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
and
a
tartness
from
the
cherries
for
something
that
could
be
so
sweet
sam
really
knows
how
to
balance
his
beer
sam
adams
does
wonders
with
this
beer
the
smell
is
over
the
top
and
the
taste
toned
down
enough
to
complement
it
it
appeals
to
multiple
senses
at
once
the
beer
has
ample
carbonation
creating
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
for
a
fruit
beer
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
maybe
i
should
put
a
disclaimer
on
this
i
dont
mind
sweet
beers
and
this
time
of
year
fruit
wheats
are
great
in
the
hot
southern
weather
poured
a
medium
brown
honey
color
with
a
quickly
dissipated
white
cap
aroma
was
very
much
cherry
almost
like
a
cherry
jolly
rancher
with
a
little
grain
undertones
in
the
nose
the
problem
i
had
with
this
beer
is
it
reminded
me
of
cherry
cough
syrup
even
though
i
love
the
kriek
lambics
and
other
cherry
drinks
this
one
turned
me
off
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
if
i
could
have
seperated
the
cherry
flavor
and
the
wheat
flavor
they
may
have
been
good
but
some
some
reason
together
remind
me
of
a
medicinal
syrup
a
little
bitterness
to
help
mellow
it
out
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
medium
carbonation
i
would
not
have
this
again
d
yeah
um
no
thanks
the
2nd
worst
fruitveggie
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
with
a
golden
body
some
brownish
tone
and
a
thick
light
tan
head
smells
gorgeous
marzipan
sweet
almondy
ripe
cherry
and
malt
the
taste
follows
up
with
sweet
cherry
right
up
front
then
breadydoughymarzipan
flavors
and
a
bitter
finish
the
hops
dont
stick
out
here
allowing
the
sweets
to
come
forward
delightfully
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
already
one
of
my
favorite
brews
of
all
time
delicious
with
a
chicken
parm
sub
tastes
was
cherry
think
of
a
good
lager
with
some
cherries
thrown
in
at
first
it
was
refreshing
and
different
after
i
finished
just
one
beer
though
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
it
im
not
so
sure
that
beers
are
made
to
be
this
fruity
however
it
was
a
decently
good
beer
and
it
is
definitely
what
it
claims
to
be
a
cherry
wheat
if
fruit
beers
are
your
thing
then
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
may
pick
this
up
again
later
in
the
summertime
for
a
refreshing
fruity
beer
they
were
giving
bottles
of
this
away
at
a
local
bennigans
for
25
cents
over
the
summer
great
deal
i
like
this
much
better
than
samuel
adams
cranberry
lambic
smell
is
of
sweet
cherry
its
really
close
in
taste
to
a
black
cherry
soda
with
alcohol
of
course
the
apperance
is
nice
pretty
basic
amber
with
a
good
head
drinkability
is
also
goodhad
three
before
they
told
me
they
were
all
out
wasnt
surprised
considering
the
price
drinkability
it
may
not
be
the
best
of
the
sam
adams
line
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
somewhat
refreshing
an
ok
beer
if
you
can
find
it
on
sale
somewhere
and
nothing
else
is
available
overall
pop
the
top
and
enjoy
this
with
dessert
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
was
not
extremely
impressed
but
i
wasnt
let
down
either
very
orange
beer
with
a
decent
almost
white
head
from
a
fairly
gentle
pour
slight
haze
and
lots
of
streams
of
bubbles
wheat
and
cherries
on
the
nose
pleasantly
sweet
taste
though
the
cherries
are
not
as
far
forward
in
the
taste
as
in
the
aroma
light
hops
bitterness
and
a
nice
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slim
but
very
quaffable
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
have
not
read
much
about
mixing
beers
on
this
site
but
in
this
instance
i
think
it
was
a
good
solution
and
helped
me
to
enjoy
a
few
pints
on
a
sunday
afternoon
it
poors
out
an
orangish
red
color
with
a
frothy
light
head
smells
of
deep
marichino
cherries
little
else
in
the
smell
aside
from
a
touch
of
hops
some
kind
of
noble
hop
if
i
had
to
guess
but
actually
pretty
nondescript
with
the
screaming
cherry
over
it
okay
so
the
cherry
will
hit
you
right
up
front
but
after
this
subsides
there
is
a
pretty
good
malty
flavor
actually
a
delicious
maltiness
very
earthy
and
strong
the
cherry
plays
pretty
well
with
it
too
if
only
it
tasted
a
little
less
like
marichino
and
more
like
pie
filling
cherries
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
the
second
best
one
i
think
i
have
had
mouthfeel
is
unassuming
and
light
maybe
a
little
warming
but
i
dont
know
how
at
5
2
the
beer
is
an
okay
one
ill
warn
that
if
you
dont
like
fruit
beers
you
wont
like
it
if
you
like
beer
and
can
appreciate
a
good
mix
of
fruit
in
it
then
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
try
this
is
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
just
beating
out
the
hefe
weizen
the
smell
of
cherries
hits
you
as
soon
as
you
pour
it
it
has
a
medium
to
dark
red
color
to
go
along
with
it
and
there
wasnt
much
head
its
definitely
sweeter
than
most
fruity
beers
ive
had
i
drank
it
with
a
burger
and
they
went
surprisingly
well
together
d
for
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
wheat
beer
im
suprised
i
even
picked
it
up
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
breath
of
fresh
air
very
nice
this
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
large
two
finger
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
a
very
sweet
strong
cherry
its
not
badbut
its
alittle
strange
for
a
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
good
and
i
would
rate
it
higher
except
that
its
all
cherry
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
wheat
beer
flavorbut
this
tastes
only
like
cherries
and
it
makes
me
feel
that
the
flavor
is
fake
it
is
refreshing
and
a
light
mf
makes
this
a
nice
crossover
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
this
is
ok
and
better
than
i
thoughtbut
i
just
wish
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
complex
pours
a
gold
with
reddish
tint
and
a
very
light
head
smells
strong
of
cherry
cant
really
detect
much
beyond
because
it
is
so
strong
taste
is
what
one
would
expect
a
cherry
flavored
beer
it
has
a
sour
tinge
that
gives
it
a
kick
but
basically
unless
you
really
like
cherry
flavoring
you
should
probably
stay
away
from
this
one
i
like
fruit
and
beer
so
thats
why
my
review
is
actually
higher
than
most
beerdrinkers
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
measure
it
is
just
not
a
particularly
great
beer
either
this
beer
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
or
over
powerful
the
beer
was
a
welcome
change
of
pace
verdict
a
good
summer
beer
this
would
go
great
with
a
hamburger
fresh
off
the
grill
either
way
a
noble
try
from
boston
beer
poured
this
beer
into
a
mug
from
the
bottle
it
pours
a
goldenamber
it
has
a
light
wheat
nose
that
has
a
heavy
cherry
overtone
it
has
very
little
head
that
quickly
dissipates
it
has
a
slightly
fizzy
and
medium
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
overwhelmed
with
cherry
i
can
barely
detect
the
wheat
flavors
due
to
the
overwhelming
cherry
taste
and
aftertaste
if
the
cherry
flavoring
was
toned
down
about
75
it
might
be
a
refreshing
beer
i
do
like
the
majority
of
beers
that
sam
adams
makes
however
i
think
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
tasted
from
them
i
like
the
cherry
lambic
much
better
gorgeous
cherry
amber
color
with
a
lasting
faerie
ring
this
beer
shows
off
its
cherry
jello
and
tart
candy
aroma
nicely
for
those
of
us
who
are
head
over
wings
for
fruity
sweets
sadly
the
taste
does
not
fair
as
well
as
the
scent
starting
sweet
there
is
a
bitter
end
that
smacks
of
cough
syrup
clean
and
fizzy
oh
so
spritely
its
still
difficult
to
take
in
fortunately
as
the
beer
warms
it
does
relax
a
little
adding
to
the
drinkability
and
since
you
wont
be
reaching
for
your
glass
much
its
sure
to
warm
drinkability
this
would
actually
be
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
but
the
taste
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
finish
even
one
the
way
it
feels
in
the
mouth
and
light
bodied
nature
makes
it
great
for
drinking
if
i
try
to
concentrate
less
on
taste
in
the
summer
i
could
drink
this
a
lot
its
light
not
as
sweet
as
a
cherry
pop
and
reminds
me
of
kiddie
cocktails
i
used
to
have
as
a
kid
however
when
i
want
a
beer
i
want
a
beer
two
hours
after
drinking
this
i
was
still
trying
to
find
things
to
get
the
brutal
aftertaste
out
of
my
mouth
it
leaves
a
very
sickly
sweet
feeling
and
thus
makes
this
beer
something
to
be
avoided
for
now
i
honestly
think
this
one
needs
a
retooling
tone
down
the
cherry
make
it
less
dominant
allow
the
other
flavors
to
mingle
more
if
they
could
make
the
taste
subtle
like
stoney
creek
does
with
their
vanilla
porter
i
would
have
been
happier
this
is
icky
just
plain
icky
i
know
a
few
girls
that
enjoy
this
as
a
fruity
girly
drink
but
i
think
this
is
really
unenjoyable
its
like
cough
syrup
robitussin
comes
to
mind
fakely
cherry
flavored
tussin
i
think
i
cant
manage
more
than
three
sips
gross
yucky
ew
blech
gags
pours
a
pale
orangish
color
with
a
slight
haze
two
finger
head
is
densely
packed
and
retains
well
leaves
nice
spiderweb
lacing
maraschino
cherries
dominate
the
nose
with
wheat
and
some
pale
malt
just
pulling
through
wheat
and
a
surprisingly
mild
cherry
syrup
flavor
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
aftertaste
shows
some
very
quiet
earthy
tones
mild
hops
and
cherry
skins
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
allow
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finish
is
a
touch
sweet
but
wont
detract
from
you
enjoying
something
this
unique
and
refreshing
pours
a
solid
copper
color
with
a
nice
tight
white
foam
of
compact
bubbles
over
the
top
big
cascade
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
is
keeping
the
head
at
a
substantial
level
a
little
darker
than
i
would
expect
for
a
wheat
but
that
could
be
from
the
cherry
nose
is
pretty
strong
cherry
with
a
subtle
wheaty
creamy
character
to
keep
it
from
being
to
candylike
pretty
well
all
about
the
cherry
here
flavor
is
more
wheat
central
than
the
nose
the
fruity
cherry
sweetness
hits
up
front
but
fades
behind
an
almost
heavy
wheat
character
it
has
a
light
bitter
to
light
astringent
character
on
the
finish
im
torn
between
this
being
a
very
mild
hopping
or
an
astringent
grain
quality
its
not
very
pleasing
either
way
feel
is
moderate
with
a
very
velvety
carbonation
giving
it
a
nice
creamy
character
im
just
not
sure
what
i
think
about
this
one
i
like
the
nose
a
fair
bit
as
the
wheat
and
cherry
blend
well
but
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
off
to
me
the
grainyness
is
too
strong
and
that
finish
is
not
working
its
not
a
beer
i
think
i
will
be
getting
again
ive
never
had
a
cherry
wheat
so
this
may
just
not
be
my
thing
im
not
sure
all
i
know
is
that
the
remaining
four
bottles
were
thrown
away
tonight
the
first
time
this
has
ever
happened
this
wont
deter
me
i
guess
it
is
worth
a
try
just
to
see
what
your
tastes
are
i
personally
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
if
it
were
given
to
me
it
was
just
that
bad
but
im
not
a
cherry
wheat
guy
but
then
again
maybe
it
tasted
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
and
i
just
hated
it
either
way
im
done
with
the
cherry
wheat
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
isnt
great
either
i
would
like
it
better
with
less
sweet
cherry
flavor
and
more
maltiness
i
could
drink
this
on
occasion
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
sam
adams
creation
i
poured
the
crystal
clear
sunset
golden
it
into
a
pint
glass
creating
a
nice
rocky
head
its
cherry
smell
was
pervasive
and
artifically
sweet
just
like
an
artificiallyflavored
cherry
lollipop
underneath
were
the
cherryalcohol
notes
of
cough
syrup
the
cherry
smell
could
not
be
separated
from
the
taste
which
was
disappointing
sans
taking
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
less
cherryesque
and
disappointingly
flat
and
bland
also
the
body
of
the
beer
was
light
and
thin
from
what
i
understand
fruit
beers
are
only
supposed
to
be
mildly
fruity
however
i
could
not
finish
12
oz
of
this
brew
because
of
the
overwhelming
cherry
cough
syrup
aroma
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
for
the
holidays
when
i
read
the
label
i
was
really
excited
i
could
try
a
wheat
beer
from
a
company
i
know
makes
decent
products
from
high
quality
ingredients
i
had
a
really
good
experience
with
the
first
wheat
beer
i
tried
blue
moon
belgian
white
and
it
had
cherry
in
it
to
boot
it
sounded
perfect
when
i
actually
tried
it
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
this
may
be
made
with
wheat
but
it
is
definately
no
belgian
style
white
it
was
almost
as
heavy
and
bitter
as
regular
sam
adams
lager
anyway
since
i
havent
poured
one
out
of
the
bottle
yet
i
rated
the
appearance
at
3
im
sure
it
is
probably
a
decent
looking
brew
but
until
i
know
for
sure
its
rating
will
be
in
the
middle
when
i
do
get
around
to
pouring
one
in
a
glass
ill
edit
this
review
smell
is
pleasant
with
some
fairly
strong
but
very
clean
malt
and
of
course
cherries
taste
disappointed
me
at
first
since
i
was
expecting
the
cherry
against
a
background
of
light
citrusy
wheat
beer
instead
of
the
rather
heavier
malt
flavor
strong
enough
to
be
typical
of
the
regular
sam
adams
boston
lager
still
on
repeat
samplings
the
cherry
blends
nicely
with
the
richer
sweetness
of
the
malted
wheat
its
pleasant
with
rather
weaker
hop
presence
than
either
regular
sam
adams
boston
lager
or
sam
adams
light
either
this
beer
pluse
those
two
represent
my
entire
sampling
of
boston
beer
cos
products
at
this
time
like
youd
expect
from
this
company
even
the
relatively
bland
hops
in
this
beer
are
still
high
quality
they
fit
the
beer
and
they
bring
only
good
things
to
it
even
though
the
cherries
really
main
contributors
to
the
flavor
aside
from
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
being
a
bit
lighter
than
regular
sam
very
similar
to
saranac
lager
drinkability
is
excellent
it
gets
a
tiny
bit
thick
towards
the
end
but
its
thirst
quenching
easier
to
drink
than
regular
sam
adams
and
seems
to
be
improve
the
more
i
sample
it
and
it
also
seems
to
pair
well
with
almost
anything
ive
had
3
different
beers
with
pizza
chips
and
dip
and
buffalo
wings
and
each
time
it
went
great
with
the
food
in
conclusion
this
very
pleasant
and
fairly
unique
brew
thats
definately
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
could
drink
many
of
these
if
i
had
to
but
i
would
prefer
not
to
its
not
my
favorite
beer
and
its
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
but
its
decent
enough
if
you
have
to
drink
it
or
are
curious
to
try
it
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
small
white
fully
diminishing
head
smells
of
fake
cherry
like
maraschino
cherry
juice
over
mild
wheat
the
taste
is
dominated
by
more
fake
flavors
that
overshadow
any
redeeming
qualities
of
this
beer
it
has
a
thin
body
watery
texture
and
low
carbonation
and
its
probably
the
worst
of
the
beers
to
wear
the
sam
adams
name
big
disappointment
a
beer
worth
trying
but
perhaps
not
worth
revisiting
i
poured
one
from
a
12
oz
bottle
and
found
it
to
be
drinkable
inoffensive
but
lacking
in
any
strong
positive
qualities
the
cherry
taste
is
welldefined
but
it
blends
with
the
beer
in
such
a
way
that
i
cant
escape
thinking
this
is
how
a
flat
diet
cherry
cola
would
taste
actually
the
body
is
much
crisper
than
flat
soda
and
that
helps
make
this
an
ok
beer
poured
out
a
hazy
honey
colored
brew
with
minimal
head
smell
like
black
cherry
ice
creamnot
bad
at
all
taste
is
very
surprising
and
i
gotta
say
i
like
it
cherries
cherries
cherries
but
they
are
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
nothing
special
drinkability
goodi
wouldnt
makre
it
an
all
the
time
brew
but
great
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
has
the
perfect
body
with
excellent
carbonation
matched
with
superb
smoothness
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
a
fruity
twist
on
your
brew
this
beer
smells
like
black
cherry
ice
cream
it
tastes
a
little
like
cough
syrup
it
looks
like
a
slightly
amber
hued
light
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
not
that
great
i
could
possibly
drink
more
than
one
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
ole
sam
puts
out
some
pretty
good
brews
but
i
think
this
one
comes
up
a
little
short
maybe
its
time
this
one
is
voted
out
of
the
brewtanks
ill
finish
my
sixer
but
then
im
done
with
cherry
wheat
probably
a
decent
crossover
beer
for
the
ladies
cherry
wheat
may
be
my
least
favorite
samuel
adams
offering
to
date
if
my
memory
is
accurate
i
even
thought
the
much
maligned
cranberry
lambic
was
better
with
a
major
tweak
or
two
this
could
be
an
okay
fruit
beer
in
its
present
form
no
thank
you
if
you
like
dr
pepper
and
chewing
on
cardboard
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
on
tap
in
an
11
oz
glass
at
maggregors
this
came
to
me
as
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
with
nice
lacing
the
fruitcherry
aroma
is
very
pleasant
this
has
always
tasted
more
like
a
cherry
fruit
drink
than
a
beer
to
me
the
wheat
side
is
there
but
sorta
weak
overall
though
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
very
malty
the
moouthfeel
was
slightly
creamy
and
moderate
in
terms
of
drinkability
could
drink
this
forever
just
might
get
a
little
bored
this
beer
is
in
a
nice
bottle
and
dont
let
that
dont
judge
a
good
book
by
its
cover
idea
fool
you
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
potential
this
beer
gets
a
decent
head
and
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
but
not
too
dark
the
smell
of
this
makes
one
look
forward
to
drinking
it
and
when
it
hits
the
toungue
it
has
a
fantastic
typical
lager
flavor
but
after
swallowing
the
cherry
aftertaste
makes
this
a
spectacular
beer
sa
cherry
wheat
is
a
simple
classic
beer
nothing
special
enough
to
spend
hundreds
on
but
certainly
one
that
i
recommend
this
beer
like
most
samuel
adams
are
good
with
beef
a
steak
a
burger
etc
try
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
not
too
high
in
fact
i
had
trouble
drinking
one
im
sure
there
is
a
segment
for
this
beer
and
with
the
low
abv
it
is
a
steady
drinker
but
not
to
me
and
likely
the
majority
of
bas
something
different
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
but
drinkable
could
be
very
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
relaxing
in
the
shade
poured
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
not
as
cloudy
as
other
wheat
beers
the
head
quickly
faded
to
leave
decent
lacing
it
smells
of
sweet
cherries
and
not
much
else
tastes
the
same
way
as
it
smells
hops
are
barely
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
sticky
almost
like
cherry
syrup
also
leaves
the
lips
very
sticky
i
enjoy
this
beer
after
dinner
occasionally
as
a
dessert
but
more
than
two
would
make
me
feel
sick
it
would
have
been
nice
for
s
a
to
add
more
complexity
to
this
underachieving
brew
this
is
sort
of
sickening
i
poured
it
down
the
sink
big
on
the
cherry
flavor
but
lacking
on
everything
else
pours
a
lessredthanexpected
color
with
disapointing
head
retention
for
a
wheat
aromas
are
big
of
cherry
and
nothing
else
flavors
like
cherry
koolaid
not
real
cherries
it
has
some
good
fruity
tartness
and
a
lacking
barley
or
wheat
quality
lacking
in
the
wheat
flavors
textures
and
apprearance
yeast
offers
no
fruity
esters
or
spiciness
barley
malt
is
hardly
detected
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
fleeting
finish
i
am
suprised
that
this
beer
didnt
turn
out
better
notes
flavors
dont
mixed
together
well
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
settling
over
oh
so
slightly
hazy
goldamber
liquid
tinged
with
a
light
pinkred
cast
the
nose
is
sweet
cherries
and
malt
with
light
hopping
the
light
mouthfeel
offers
flavors
of
cherry
sweet
malt
grass
and
decent
hop
bitterness
finishes
light
spritzy
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
hot
weather
brews
overall
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
the
boston
brewing
company
i
really
like
how
this
beer
finishes
with
a
nice
wheat
taste
keep
up
the
great
work
easier
to
drink
than
sa
cranberry
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
first
sampeling
of
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
often
drink
it
during
the
summer
as
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
when
compared
to
petes
strawberry
blonde
another
widely
available
fruitbased
beer
sa
cherry
wheat
has
a
more
pronounced
fruit
taste
however
its
not
at
all
overpowering
compliments
the
wheat
nicely
i
also
find
the
sweetness
to
be
quire
neutral
i
really
detest
any
sweet
drinks
ive
never
been
able
to
finish
a
sixpack
of
milk
stout
i
bought
never
drink
fruity
mixed
drinks
so
if
youre
looking
for
something
sweet
probably
look
elswhere
i
couldnt
believe
that
a
reputable
brewer
like
samual
adams
would
produce
such
a
terrible
obnoxious
tasting
beer
i
was
very
shocked
especially
because
i
was
having
it
at
a
sam
adams
tasting
oh
well
drinkability
the
cherry
would
have
been
too
much
after
a
couple
more
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
oily
and
its
more
of
a
malted
fruit
concoction
than
a
balanced
beer
therefore
i
would
not
want
another
this
will
certainly
not
be
for
everyone
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
transitional
beer
for
those
who
like
fruit
based
mixed
drinks
it
would
also
go
well
with
spicy
foods
maybe
even
a
fruit
dessert
without
question
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
i
have
recently
tried
and
a
great
summer
beer
give
it
a
try
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
small
head
which
does
not
last
long
but
lots
of
carbonation
a
nice
lacing
after
pour
though
scent
is
very
sweet
with
a
cherry
aroma
light
body
with
a
very
nice
cherry
after
taste
not
really
much
bite
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
5
2
brew
as
with
most
if
not
all
sas
brews
very
drinkable
this
brew
really
surprised
me
since
ive
never
had
any
kind
of
beer
with
a
fruit
in
it
a
very
nice
session
beer
the
cherry
flavor
is
not
overdone
nor
does
it
seem
as
artificial
as
on
the
nose
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
malt
to
back
up
the
cherry
flavors
hops
are
present
throughout
the
sip
but
become
most
noticeable
after
the
swallowing
when
some
of
the
cherry
and
malt
notes
subside
finish
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
with
some
tart
cherry
notes
the
texture
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
however
the
flavor
is
less
than
i
had
expected
it
doesnt
quite
taste
like
a
good
wheat
beer
or
a
good
fruit
beer
i
think
you
might
be
able
to
recreate
the
flavor
with
bud
light
and
some
amaretto
opinion
i
fell
into
the
marketing
of
this
beer
and
bought
a
sixpack
oops
it
looked
and
sounded
good
even
smelled
good
before
i
tried
it
i
was
then
extremely
disappointed
when
i
tasted
it
i
recently
drank
sammies
chocolate
bock
which
was
excellent
and
it
surprises
me
that
the
same
brew
master
can
produce
this
beer
i
know
that
sam
adams
has
the
ability
to
make
a
good
beer
but
unfortunately
this
is
one
that
i
would
not
recommend
this
is
a
very
refreshing
change
light
with
good
fruit
flavor
and
crisp
good
for
these
100
degree
days
we
have
been
having
here
in
the
lone
star
state
a
great
summer
drink
and
another
solid
beer
from
the
folks
at
sam
adams
drinkability
sometimes
i
drink
this
beer
and
i
like
it
other
times
i
think
it
is
to
sweet
and
tart
and
dont
really
care
for
it
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
today
it
seems
to
be
ok
i
could
drink
a
couple
mouthfeel
is
light
but
a
bit
heavier
than
some
wheats
probably
due
to
the
syruppy
cherry
flavoring
it
remains
quite
quaffable
on
hot
days
and
is
tolerable
whoa
the
cherry
is
too
overbearing
in
this
one
pour
was
disappointing

way
too
clear
for
a
wheat
beer
although
it
had
a
nice
cherry
and
malt
aroma
the
taste
went
from
strong
cherry
in
the
beginning
to
tasting
like
robitussin
cough
syrup
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
even
the
wifezilla
while
working
on
her
bottle
said
she
couldnt
stomach
another
tastemouthfeeldrinkability
sweet
cherries
up
front
replaced
by
slightly
stale
breadiness
and
wheat
in
the
middle
mild
sweetness
in
the
finish
decent
but
not
excellent
slightly
thin
watery
but
refreshing
drinkability
is
decent
but
more
than
one
would
be
too
sweet
for
me
good
for
summertime
but
not
a
year
round
drinker
drinkability
is
ok
on
this
but
not
my
particular
favorite
flavorstyle
funny
i
remember
liking
this
a
lot
more
years
ago
waitress
told
me
she
found
the
coldest
glass
just
for
me
why
anyway
after
my
first
three
selections
were
unavailable
i
reluctantly
went
for
the
cherry
wheat
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
here
great
taste
and
smell
unlike
some
flavored
beers
that
only
have
a
hint
added
i
e
saranac
caramel
almost
as
tasty
of
a
fruitvegetable
beer
at
the
cottonwood
pumpkin
if
you
like
cherry
definitely
try
it
out
this
is
my
first
review
and
also
the
1st
fruitvegetable
beer
ive
tried
one
of
my
friends
told
me
how
much
he
liked
fruitvegetable
beers
so
when
i
saw
this
at
my
grocery
store
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
it
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
smell
of
cherries
i
wasnt
sure
what
a
fruit
beer
should
taste
like
but
the
sweet
taste
of
cherries
was
very
pleasant
there
was
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
an
overall
smooth
finish
this
was
very
different
than
any
other
beer
that
i
have
tried
but
it
was
a
good
different
i
dont
think
this
will
be
my
favorite
style
but
it
was
a
welcome
change
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
this
one
came
in
a
brewmasters
collection
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
a
freshness
date
of
july
2005
the
beer
poured
deep
clear
golden
with
a
frothy
twoinch
thick
head
and
spirited
latent
carbonation
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
very
ripe
cherries
and
bready
to
yeasty
wheat
malt
cherry
flavor
was
again
prominent
in
the
taste
although
the
beer
was
not
very
sweet
at
all
there
was
also
a
lemony
yeastiness
typical
of
american
wheat
beers
no
fruity
esters
evident
in
this
one
and
its
a
shame
because
cherries
and
bananas
go
so
well
together
a
bit
thicker
on
the
tongue
than
a
typical
wheat
due
to
the
syrupy
fruit
juice
present
in
the
brew
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
ones
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
minimal
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
smell
of
cherries
is
definitely
the
first
thing
that
was
noticed
cherry
taste
seems
a
bit
artificial
and
a
little
forced
but
the
overall
taste
is
good
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
little
bitterness
at
the
finish
detracts
from
the
overall
rating
one
or
two
of
these
beers
is
ok
in
one
sitting
but
more
than
that
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
repetitive
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
edited
jan

ive
lowered
the
rating
somewhat
as
ive
broadened
my
horizons
still
a
beer
i
like
a
lot
but
not
as
high
on
my
list
as
it
once
was
the
beer
is
not
half
bad
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
perhaps
not
the
best
beer
to
enjoy
in
winter
but
i
might
enjoy
it
more
throughout
the
spring
and
summer
months
drinkability
much
better
than
sam
adams
cranberry
lambic
which
isnt
saying
much
this
is
actually
a
decent
fruit
beer
im
not
a
huge
lover
of
the
style
in
general
so
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
things
in
succession
but
if
you
like
fruit
beers
this
is
a
must
try
respectable
and
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
head
and
very
nice
lace
smell
of
some
wheat
malt
but
mostly
sweet
marachino
cherries
taste
is
ok
some
wheat
malt
flavor
and
a
nice
bitter
ending
but
in
the
middle
is
what
i
think
is
too
much
cherry
if
the
cherry
flavor
was
either
less
sweet
or
toned
down
a
bit
it
would
be
much
better
finishes
dry
and
leaves
a
cherryness
in
your
mouth
not
super
drinkable
maybe
on
a
warm
summers
day
its
better
uncle
hamish
says
blooie
ell
lad
whut
are
ye
feedin
me
now
sweet
tart
waer
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
but
could
see
myself
getting
tired
of
cherries
eventually
nothing
special
here
but
a
decent
enough
brew
overall
not
to
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
light
swill
i
wont
be
buying
more
of
this
but
incidentally
i
got
my
bmcdrinking
scaredtodiphisfootinthewaterofrealbeer
friend
hooked
on
this
stuff
i
might
drink
some
of
his
if
i
didnt
bring
my
own
beer
but
i
would
most
likely
bring
my
own
before
resorting
to
this
for
a
session
interesting
and
i
probably
wont
be
back
but
props
to
my
parents
for
this
one
if
you
like
cherries
youll
probably
like
this
but
i
cant
really
imagine
myself
drinking
this
regularly
or
with
any
sort
of
meal
except
for
desert
the
bastard
son
of
a
wheat
beer
and
froot
loops
this
beer
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
long
time
my
girlfriend
picked
up
a
6er
a
long
time
ago
and
they
have
just
sat
there
i
had
one
after
a
night
of
drinking
maredsous
10
and
i
thought
it
was
more
akin
to
snorting
pixie
sticks
than
having
a
beer
never
come
close
to
this
beer
unless
you
are
firm
in
your
opinion
that
you
want
a
fruit
beer
it
isnt
one
of
the
best
beers
of
had
but
compared
to
the
competitors
in
this
genre
it
aint
too
bad
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
large
rocky
white
head
pronounced
cherry
smell
along
with
wheat
malt
the
cherry
flavor
is
not
as
strong
as
in
many
fruit
beers
but
the
flavor
is
off
it
reminds
me
of
cherry
flavored
cough
drops
i
could
not
detect
any
hops
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
cherry
flavor
but
it
could
have
been
worse
a
solid
beer
paired
with
thanksgiving
dinner
poured
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
medium
head
that
retained
itself
well
smell
of
dark
cherries
permeates
the
first
whiff
of
this
beer
tasted
somewhat
sweet
with
a
prevalent
cherry
flavor
that
comes
out
immediately
and
stays
with
the
tongue
after
swallowing
this
beer
did
not
have
the
residual
bitterness
noted
in
other
beers
of
the
same
type
in
other
words
this
to
me
seemed
more
on
the
lager
than
on
the
ale
side
one
could
easily
order
another
one
of
these
after
the
first
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
surprise
was
the
nicely
rounded
mouthfeel
an
afterthought
to
the
scent
its
hard
to
critically
speak
about
this
beer
the
scent
was
gagging
and
the
flavor
was
wholly
lacking
just
poor
beer
passing
a
fruit
cocktail
for
those
who
dont
like
beer
the
exact
reason
why
my
friends
had
bought
it
too
sweet
and
fruity
for
me
but
my
girlfriend
likes
it
the
aroma
is
of
cherries
which
also
comes
through
in
the
flavor
the
cherry
is
so
strong
that
it
overpowers
any
hope
of
tasting
hops
the
beer
poured
out
of
the
bottle
oale
gold
in
color
with
hardly
any
head
a
good
beer
to
share
as
a
novelty
but
i
am
not
overly
fond
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
that
goes
way
back
to
when
i
first
discovered
good
beer
it
looks
like
a
traditional
wheat
beer
but
has
a
reddish
tint
and
has
little
or
no
head
the
smell
of
cherries
invites
you
to
drink
this
wonderful
brew
the
taste
is
also
of
cherries
and
a
nice
balance
of
wheat
malt
and
just
a
tinge
of
hops
i
am
not
usually
fond
of
fruit
beers
but
this
beer
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
it
is
definitely
drinkable
dont
let
me
turn
you
off
from
this
beer
my
wife
a
beer
neophyte
loves
it
but
its
just
not
to
my
liking
this
beer
pours
a
copper
colour
into
the
glass
it
has
a
big
white
foamy
head
that
are
long
lasting
the
smell
is
strong
of
cherries
it
has
an
artificial
smell
too
the
charry
taste
isnt
as
strong
as
the
smell
it
also
has
a
wheaty
malt
taste
i
find
the
body
to
think
for
my
liking
well
this
wasnt
my
favourite
beer
but
it
was
worth
trying
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
sits
about
a
14
its
a
decent
looking
beer
the
smell
is
good
it
smells
predominately
of
cherries
the
taste
is
wheatlike
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
and
as
it
coats
your
mouth
a
strong
cherry
flavor
takes
over
strong
cherry
aftertaste
average
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
its
an
alright
beer
but
nothing
special
im
not
big
on
cherry
flavored
beers
unless
its
a
lambic
or
something
of
the
sorts
maybe
just
not
this
one
try
it
if
you
think
this
might
be
down
your
alley
poured
a
clear
ambergold
with
a
12
inch
head
that
retained
fairly
well
aroma
was
noticeable
upon
popping
the
cap
as
a
sodalike
cherry
aroma
first
presented
itself
upon
further
aromatic
detction
however
i
found
the
aroma
to
contain
a
bit
of
wheat
like
malt
and
a
lot
of
artificial
smelling
cherry
the
flavor
is
a
lot
better
than
the
aroma
as
the
cherry
flavor
is
a
lot
more
subdued
than
the
aroma
might
let
on
the
flavor
begins
with
a
tight
melding
of
cherry
carbonic
bite
and
dry
wheaty
malt
it
soon
segues
into
just
malt
and
leaves
a
cereal
taste
almost
like
cheerios
to
linger
in
the
mouth
the
body
is
way
too
light
and
this
beer
could
use
a
little
higher
mash
temperature
the
drinkability
is
quite
subjective
and
personally
i
would
go
for
an
apricot
ale
from
pyramid
instead
of
another
cherry
wheat
as
it
is
a
bit
too
sodalike
and
is
definetly
a
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
beer
but
like
alcopops
i
am
not
a
hhuge
fan
of
this
beer
it
is
definitely
not
of
the
quality
as
other
boston
beer
offerings
the
cherry
smell
is
nice
but
when
i
taste
it
all
i
taste
is
syrup
like
cough
syrup
it
is
not
the
least
bit
complex
however
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
nonbeer
crowd
it
is
without
a
doubt
a
step
up
from
the
malternatives
pours
out
a
copper
color
with
good
lacing
a
very
strong
aroma
of
cherries
that
doesnt
smell
bad
just
not
what
i
prefer
i
thought
it
was
overwhelmed
with
the
cherry
flavor
and
good
hints
of
spices
the
body
was
full
and
heavy
to
me
this
beer
is
not
my
style
but
i
give
it
respect
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
serve
after
dinner
this
has
certainly
got
to
be
one
of
my
absolute
fovourites
from
samuel
adams
extremely
tasty
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
almost
no
head
just
a
thin
slightly
offwhite
haze
laces
the
glass
nicely
just
looks
good
almost
thirst
quenching
the
smell
is
very
strong
of
cherry
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
there
is
cherry
in
there
the
taste
is
divine
alot
of
cherry
at
first
then
it
subsides
to
a
maltiness
which
then
gives
way
to
a
very
nice
toasted
flavour
just
delicious
medium
bodied
not
too
heavy
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
the
black
motor
oil
porters
and
stouts
that
i
typically
drink
very
tasty
very
smooth
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
fantastic
oelergud
medium
gold
body
no
lasting
head
at
all
even
with
a
proper
pour
smells
like
not
very
surprising
cherris
the
taste
is
again
cherry
strong
but
a
yeastiness
is
present
from
the
wheat
beer
base
not
too
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
stays
away
from
a
cloying
flavor
does
not
approach
cough
syrupy
its
like
someone
put
grenadine
in
a
sam
adams
hefeweizen
drinkability
definitely
a
dessert
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
this
with
a
meal
however
it
is
refreshing
and
has
a
good
cherry
flavor
unfortunately
it
was
awfully
light
almost
like
drinking
a
flavored
light
beer
for
my
taste
nice
to
see
that
sam
adams
has
continued
to
produce
this
unique
fruit
brew
over
the
years
its
the
best
but
it
does
have
some
merit
to
it
ive
been
drinking
this
one
way
before
i
was
drinking
craft
beers
had
it
again
recently
as
this
was
the
only
somewhat
nonmacro
that
was
offered
it
was
an
amber
color
with
a
small
straw
head
it
smells
like
cherry
and
wheat
but
artificial
like
it
has
a
good
taste
for
just
drinking
beer
it
is
somewhat
sour
like
and
sweet
too
had
a
nice
hop
finish
i
see
why
i
liked
it
so
much
when
i
was
younger
and
dumber
if
theres
not
much
else
to
order
i
would
stick
with
this
one
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
average
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
offering
from
sam
adams
fails
miserably
as
a
fruit
beer
and
is
a
wretched
example
of
style
yellow
colored
body
slightly
opaque
with
a
light
white
head
smells
like
cherries
tastes
like
drinking
a
cherry
popsicle
cherry
is
not
my
favorite
fruit
flavor
the
cherry
characteristics
of
this
beer
overwhelmed
me
if
you
really
like
the
flavor
of
a
cherry
popsicle
you
just
might
like
this
but
this
is
not
for
me
slightly
bitter
but
overwhelmingly
the
flavor
is
of
cherry
cough
syrup
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
youd
be
better
off
going
out
and
drinking
a
bottle
of
robitussin
this
beer
is
good
but
there
is
a
little
to
much
sweetness
to
it
when
one
first
drinks
the
beer
it
tastes
more
like
a
sweetened
beverage
than
a
beer
the
intial
taste
is
good
but
the
taste
flatens
out
when
one
starts
to
swallow
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
okay
beer
but
it
is
a
little
to
sweet
for
a
same
adams
beer
for
my
taste
the
cherry
and
beer
flavor
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
the
cherry
taste
almost
overpowers
the
beer
overall
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
and
one
to
try
either
by
itself
or
with
light
nonspicy
snacks
on
a
warm
summers
day
medium
amber
color
with
a
good
lace
very
strong
pleasant
cherry
smell
taste
is
quite
mild
with
cherries
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
but
nonexistant
bitterness
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
a
good
refreshment
that
would
complement
milder
foods
or
good
on
its
own
smallish
slightly
offwhite
head
on
an
amber
shaded
brew
lacing
was
excellent
reasonably
strong
cherry
aroma
taste
was
pale
malts
balanced
with
cherry
flavor
but
not
overpowered
by
them
mouthfeel
was
good
for
a
fruit
beer
which
is
a
reasonable
compliment
since
i
am
not
the
worlds
biggest
fruit
beer
fan
drinkability
was
good
as
well
although
i
am
guessing
the
cherry
flavor
was
strong
enough
to
get
old
after
awhile
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
give
it
a
try
nice
long
lasting
creamy
head
glittering
opaque
orange
color
body
the
smell
is
of
artificial
cherry
like
cherry
yogurt
cherry
yogourt
in
the
taste
with
some
peaches
and
hints
of
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
round
with
a
low
carbonation
the
artificial
aromas
and
flavors
are
quite
annoying
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
another
one
then
again
i
dont
really
like
cherry
not
as
sour
as
a
lambic
not
as
refreshing
as
a
pilsner
this
beer
has
a
niche
in
between
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
the
head
is
big
offwhite
foamy
the
beer
is
almost
clear
a
dirty
orangeamber
aroma
is
very
sweet
cherry
ice
cream
really
sweet
cherries
dominate
the
front
with
sweet
cream
filling
in
the
middle
its
almost
a
white
chocolate
taste
finishes
better
the
sweetness
tames
it
bitters
a
little
and
nuts
show
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
creamy
with
a
nice
nutty
finish
but
its
too
sweet
for
me
even
as
an
ice
cream
beer
mouthfeel
was
creamy
with
medium
body
however
i
wouldve
like
something
a
little
more
lively
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
feel
like
drinking
more
than
two
i
think
beer
pours
a
nice
redamber
color
strong
carbonation
and
an
almostwhite
head
that
manages
to
stick
around
a
respectable
amount
of
time
the
cherry
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
balanced
well
with
light
hops
and
wheat
taste
lives
up
to
the
promise
of
the
smell
wheat
and
hops
lead
the
way
are
joined
by
the
cherry
midway
before
giving
way
to
a
nice
fruity
finish
the
cherry
is
subtle
and
fades
fast
and
clean
enough
to
avoid
a
coughsyrup
tackiness
i
live
in
the
desert
and
this
is
a
beer
in
my
regular
rotation
during
the
summer
when
i
want
something
light
refreshing
and
able
to
cut
through
a
dry
throat
with
a
little
bite
utterly
drinkable
after
a
couple
of
these
the
cherry
sweetness
becomes
cloying
and
artificial
still
this
is
a
drinkable
and
somewhat
light
beer
if
you
like
cherry
soda
with
a
mild
kick
overall
i
do
like
it
but
i
think
next
time
ill
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
while
cooking
up
some
bbq
with
some
friends
newly
discovered
and
now
one
of
my
current
favorites
i
could
drink
this
constantly
and
have
aroma
is
all
cherries
cherry
taste
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
declines
quickly
into
wheat
with
a
slight
bitterness
but
finishes
cleanly
this
beer
will
be
great
for
the
summer
cherry
wheat
uh
oh
this
is
one
of
the
more
stranger
beers
from
sam
adams
poured
out
a
dark
gold
which
left
lacing
around
the
glass
pretty
nice
appearance
i
must
admit
smell
was
mostly
cherries
almost
like
cough
syrup
taste
was
average
at
best
wheat
upfront
mixed
with
some
cherries
cherries
seemed
to
be
quite
sweet
a
little
sweetier
than
i
expected
it
to
be
ah
average
at
best
while
i
dont
know
if
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
it
is
certainly
not
very
drinkable
i
like
the
first
but
couldnt
stand
it
by
the
third
pours
a
golden
color
with
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
quickly
dissapatind
medium
sized
head
aroma
is
entirely
of
cherries
flavor
starts
of
with
a
cherry
sweetness
giving
way
to
a
crispy
wheat
aftertaste
with
some
pilsner
characteristics
also
again
this
wasnt
bad
but
it
lost
its
appeal
quickly
i
dont
know
what
it
was
exactly
but
maybe
cherries
and
beer
just
werent
meant
really
for
each
other
no
hops
no
wheat
to
sweet
of
a
cherry
at
that
ug
not
very
good
choice
imo
poured
a
hazy
light
bronze
color
the
aroma
was
as
expected
a
little
kreiky
all
the
natural
elements
to
this
beer
are
fine
water
wheat
hops
it
is
the
cough
syrup
finish
that
kills
all
the
promise
this
one
isnt
necessarily
always
a
good
decision
12
ounce
bottle
freshness
date
of

pours
golden
bronze
with
a
respectable
off
white
head
obvious
nose
of
cherry
and
some
yeast
in
the
background
as
advertised
cherry
flavor
carries
the
freight
here
typical
american
wheat
beer
mouth
feel
and
body
sweet
cherry
flavor
just
about
right
strenghwise
present
but
not
overpowering
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
by
this
one
nice
summer
quaffer
or
desert
beer
good
golden
wheat
color
frothy
white
head
not
very
thick
good
aroma
with
a
strong
sour
cherry
scent
there
is
a
pronounced
sweetsour
cherry
taste
on
top
strong
enough
that
it
somewhat
mutes
the
flavor
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
still
though
the
balance
of
this
beer
makes
it
one
of
the
crispest
beers
ive
had
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
leaves
little
to
no
aftertaste
a
great
summer
beer
especially
with
the
low
abv
this
beer
is
great
with
rhubarb
pie
or
raspberry
chocolate
cheesecake
zum
wohl
gold
like
a
pale
ale
big
soft
head
sweetened
cherries
with
some
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
not
bad
just
dominated
by
a
simple
sweetened
fruit
flavor
that
gets
annoying
to
me
mediumbodied
smooth
and
soft
wellmade
fine
beer
not
my
favorite
flavor
and
rather
simple
strong
cherry
i
can
enjoy
one
of
these
every
onceinawhile
pours
out
golden
colored
with
a
slight
orange
tint
to
it
and
a
great
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
behind
as
well
aroma
is
all
cherries
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
but
not
overpowering
which
is
most
peoples
fear
with
this
type
of
beer
it
is
moderate
in
strength
but
sweet
making
it
undesirable
after
maybe
2
or
3
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
always
enjoy
sammy
a
cherry
wheat
once
in
a
while
smells
like
cherry
flavored
cough
drops
to
me
but
i
think
smell
is
overrated
anyway
ive
had
plenty
of
excellent
cheeses
that
smell
like
a
marathoners
jock
strap
i
like
the
cloudy
mysterious
amber
color
although
the
head
is
on
the
thin
side
and
yep
it
tastes
like
a
cherry
flavored
wheat
beer
to
me
the
cherry
flavor
actually
takes
about
a
half
second
to
hit
you
and
isnt
overpowering
like
too
many
fruit
beers
but
it
is
still
a
little
on
the
strong
side
subtlety
is
best
with
the
fruit
beers
a
little
harsh
going
down
but
drinkable
not
my
favorite
but
its
still
good
for
a
quaff
now
and
then
overall
impression
too
much
cherry
not
enough
hops
just
leaves
the
beer
one
sided
and
not
on
a
good
side
i
like
fruit
beers
too
bad
this
isnt
one
i
really
cannot
fathom
why
this
is
rated
as
high
as
it
is
an
ok
fruit
beer
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
though
cherries
just
a
little
too
overpowering
but
considering
its
in
the
name
i
suppose
that
is
the
point
if
it
were
a
bit
more
subtle
the
wheat
could
come
out
and
play
making
this
a
more
complex
brew
as
it
is
its
a
singlethemed
dessert
i
dont
remember
the
cherry
flavor
in
this
beer
being
so
dominant
and
annoying
at
times
it
used
to
be
a
nice
compliment
but
now
its
taken
a
turn
for
the
worse
nevertheless
still
a
decent
beer
you
can
still
taste
wheatiness
though
it
is
not
very
pronounced
the
cherry
aspect
is
pleasing
but
gets
on
my
nerves
at
the
same
time
it
seems
too
much
like
cherry
cough
syrup
now
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
once
again
this
would
make
a
nice
afterdinner
dessert
beer
pours
to
a
frothy
offwhite
head
and
deep
goldenorange
color
smells
like
cherries
and
creamnot
beerlike
at
all
flavor
starts
with
a
rush
of
charry
flavor
then
fades
out
to
reveal
a
nice
wheat
beer
base
finishes
with
a
sour
wheat
malt
aftertaste
mixed
with
fresh
cherries
a
remarkable
beer
that
has
real
beer
flavors
mixed
with
cherries
it
would
be
appreciated
by
non
beer
lovers
as
well
after
all
these
years
this
is
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
and
dull
golden
amber
color
topped
with
a
rich
and
creamy
head
that
left
walls
of
lace
on
the
glass
theres
no
mistaking
the
sweet
cherries
in
the
aroma
fruity
and
sweet
malt
nose
with
some
sourness
from
the
wheat
malts
quite
amazing
actually
its
like
smelling
a
chocolate
and
cherry
cream
pie
smells
appetizing
taste
is
light
and
fruity
with
a
slight
metallictannic
tinge
to
it
pleasant
hop
bitterness
peeks
its
head
out
of
all
that
fruitiness
some
lactic
sourness
comes
through
medium
to
light
body
and
overall
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
change
of
pace
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
my
second
favorite
fruit
wheat
beer
behind
abitas
purple
haze
raspberry
wheat
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
many
of
them
in
a
sitting
its
a
very
sweet
beer
well
another
one
of
those
beers
that
is
what
it
is
not
exactly
great
not
exactly
horrible
just
in
the
middle
average
though
id
have
one
again
its
not
exactly
something
id
hunt
down
not
usually
a
flavored
beer
guy
i
decide
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
anyway
i
figured
sam
adams
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
why
not
it
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
amber
with
little
head
that
recedes
very
quickly
the
smell
of
cherry
is
very
strong
it
smells
like
a
jar
of
maricino
cheeries
the
taste
is
also
very
strong
in
the
cherry
aspect
its
all
i
can
really
taste
im
giving
it
a
good
grade
because
it
really
delivers
what
the
name
implies
but
this
isnt
a
drink
i
can
have
too
often
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
its
like
a
candy
in
many
ways
notes
start
the
night
with
your
favorites
then
step
to
the
cherry
wheat
your
tastebuds
wont
be
mad
at
you
for
trying
to
sneak
on
past
em
i
disagree
with
the
cherry
flavored
addative
the
lack
of
added
artificial
ingredients
is
why
i
love
my
other
sams
this
one
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
smell
is
strong
on
cherry
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
fresh
baked
bread
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
quite
unusual
at
first
but
i
liked
it
the
more
i
drank
it
starts
out
very
strong
in
cherry
flavor
sweet
at
first
then
tarty
towards
the
end
wheat
provides
the
base
and
is
also
a
strong
flavor
the
two
flavors
mix
well
together
the
finish
is
acidic
and
dry
it
is
also
very
crisp
this
wasnt
the
most
complex
brew
in
the
world
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
is
a
very
mild
flavored
beer
with
a
noticeable
cherry
flavor
it
has
a
cloudy
wheatlike
appearance
and
the
wheat
flavor
is
indeed
also
noticeable
this
is
one
of
my
husbands
favorite
beers
and
he
considers
it
a
guilty
pleasure
because
it
is
artificially
flavored
it
isnt
very
hoppy
or
malty
there
are
times
when
you
want
one
of
these
it
quenches
thirst
well
as
it
is
im
glad
i
only
purchased
a
single
just
so
i
could
have
the
bottle
for
my
collection
this
is
the
only
beer
ive
had
recently
that
i
definately
will
not
be
buying
again
cheers
drinkability
for
me
at
least
off
the
chart
if
i
could
only
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
it
i
drink
some
of
the
other
sa
products
but
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
beer
outstanding
a
bit
more
cherry
up
front
on
the
taste
a
bit
more
head
and
a
bit
drier
and
this
would
have
been
a
five
across
the
board
i
truly
do
love
this
beer
well
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
i
was
very
let
down
it
pours
a
very
promising
gold
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
which
went
away
fairly
quick
the
smell
was
decent
smelled
like
a
typical
weat
or
ale
with
a
very
small
cherry
smell
the
overall
flavor
was
quite
bland
not
much
of
anything
stood
out
other
than
the
artificial
cherry
taste
and
an
odd
aftertaste
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
another
6pk
of
this
although
i
may
try
it
on
tap
sometime
to
see
if
its
any
better
i
had
this
previously
on
draft
and
the
bottled
version
seemed
to
have
more
flavor
all
in
all
a
refreshing
brew
if
unspectacular
a
nice
appearance
light
copper
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
mainly
a
strong
cherry
aroma
with
virtually
no
wheaty
elements
taste
likewise
was
strong
on
cherry
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
this
might
be
an
excellent
alternative
for
cider
drinkers
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
was
ok
although
the
overemphasis
on
cherry
was
a
bit
much
if
you
like
the
flavor
of
cherries
try
it
if
not
i
would
stay
away
pours
a
interesting
lager
like
yellow
with
a
hint
of
red
adequate
head
actually
smells
like
cherries
surprisingly
enough
taste
is
only
meh
true
enough
cherries
are
a
distinct
flavor
along
with
the
hops
and
reasonably
complex
the
trouble
is
for
me
the
whole
package
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
i
dont
feel
the
cherry
taste
complements
the
beer
in
any
way
it
just
overrides
it
cheers
to
sam
adams
for
trying
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
but
nothing
special
here
pale
golden
color
with
a
long
lasting
short
head
and
lace
till
the
end
if
you
like
cherries
you
might
like
this
one
a
little
heavy
on
the
artifical
flavoring
though
the
nose
is
full
of
sweet
dark
cherry
aroma
with
a
slight
malt
background
the
taste
is
full
of
cherry
followed
by
the
malt
a
lingering
cherry
aftertaste
a
fun
beer
to
drink
but
not
one
id
drink
very
often
kinda
like
a
flavored
coffee
its
okay
once
in
awhile
but
its
best
without
all
the
flavorings
when
poured
it
was
a
light
golden
yellow
with
very
little
foam
the
smell
of
cherries
was
very
evident
along
with
a
hint
of
a
yeasty
wheat
aroma
the
taste
of
cherries
was
pleasant
but
sort
of
short
on
the
after
taste
and
very
little
wheat
in
the
finish
not
what
i
expected
but
it
could
have
been
worst
an
average
beer
from
samuel
adams
that
i
will
not
purchase
again
not
nearly
as
girly
as
i
might
have
guessed
ill
drink
this
from
time
to
time
a
decent
balanced
beer
overall
on
tap
at
logan
airport
clear
red
color
with
a
nice
sticky
head
that
leaves
lacing
after
every
sip
smell
is
of
tart
cherry
cough
syrup
and
a
bit
of
sour
wheat
taste
is
smooth
more
cherry
cough
syrup
with
a
decent
malt
balance
and
a
touch
of
hops
not
bad
one
of
my
early
favorites
and
introductions
to
the
world
of
good
beer
whole
lot
better
than
i
expected
enjoyed
this
at
the
bar
next
to
the
movie
theatre
before
watching
kill
bill
poured
a
little
darker
than
a
typical
lager
pretty
dark
for
a
wheat
large
white
headgood
lacing
etc
i
didnt
bother
to
smell
it
because
i
was
in
a
crowded
bar
taste
was
very
much
like
their
summer
ale
with
only
a
hint
of
cherry
if
any
drinkability
was
pretty
high
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
a
little
bland
but
refreshing
color
is
a
hazy
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
somewhat
fast
lace
is
spotty
aroma
reminds
me
of
watered
down
cherry
flavored
cough
syrup
or
maybe
koolaid
theres
some
wheat
malts
giving
an
overall
sweetness
in
with
the
flat
cherryness
that
seems
artificial
to
me
a
powerful
nose
as
it
warms
but
seems
almost
to
much
and
a
bit
artificial
taste
is
sweet
malts
of
wheat
pale
and
soft
with
a
kick
of
cherry
tart
flavor
thats
a
bit
to
sweet
and
again
comes
across
somewhat
artificial
and
syrupy
a
little
hard
to
get
past
the
cherryness
with
a
bubbly
carbonation
and
lighter
feel
that
nearly
makes
it
champagnelike
as
it
warms
it
becomes
alot
easier
to
handle
and
makes
for
a
nice
drinker
but
i
dont
think
id
have
alot
of
this
before
the
flavor
starts
to
get
old
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
unless
you
get
sickened
easy
by
sweet
stuff
this
could
be
served
as
an
afterdinner
or
desert
beer
just
make
sure
you
like
cherries
before
trying
this
one
next
time
sam
adams
wants
to
make
a
cherry
wheat
they
should
use
real
cherries
and
more
than
an
ounce
of
wheat
grain
looked
like
it
wasnt
going
to
be
a
decent
wheat
nice
golden
hazy
color
decent
white
head
which
stayed
but
alas
the
taste
was
the
downfall
cherry
cherry
and
more
cherry
not
the
good
cherry
either
mind
you
the
cheap
caugh
syrup
type
cherry
yuuuck
behind
the
cherry
theyre
was
little
to
tell
not
much
hop
to
it
just
seemed
clean
unfortunately
the
horrid
cherry
flavor
masked
a
decent
american
wheat
my
advice
to
boston
beer
use
natural
cherry
flavor
very
tasty
this
is
definitely
a
great
gateway
beer
perfect
for
those
friends
with
a
sweet
tooth
smooth
and
very
fruity
this
is
still
decent
for
those
with
a
more
refined
palate
i
can
only
drink
23
of
these
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
little
too
much
after
a
while
when
i
first
heard
about
this
beer
i
emailed
the
sam
adams
web
page
to
ask
if
the
cherry
flavors
were
all
natural
and
they
replied
that
they
use
all
natural
ingredients
being
naive
i
believed
them
and
bought
the
beer
without
first
examining
the
labels
on
the
six
pack
sure
enough
i
get
home
and
the
label
reads
something
like
with
natural
cherries
and
cherry
flavor
added
im
paraphrasing
which
means
they
are
most
likely
stretching
the
word
natural
to
its
utmost
limits
the
cherries
smelled
and
tasted
like
cough
medicine
artificial
to
the
core
which
is
a
shame
because
the
beer
has
a
greattasting
wheat
background
that
if
combined
with
more
subtle
naturaltasting
cherry
flavors
would
have
resulted
in
a
great
beer
as
it
is
though
it
seems
as
if
sam
adams
is
either
stretching
the
truth
a
bit
with
their
claim
of
all
natural
ingredients
or
has
somehow
made
real
cherries
smell
and
taste
like
red
kool
aid
with
cough
drops
swimming
in
it
a
real
disappointment
but
then
again
ive
tasted
far
worse
id
choose
it
over
most
macros
but
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
it
if
you
can
help
it
overall
well
i
have
not
had
this
before
so
i
decided
to
try
it
but
to
be
honest
even
the
small
16oz
sample
was
far
too
sicklycherry
for
me
maybe
it
would
be
ok
as
a
dessert
beer
though
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
far
from
it
it
just
has
too
much
cherry
flavoring
to
make
it
more
than
the
occasional
beer
i
believe
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
have
had
it
in
bottle
on
tap
in
different
locations
and
even
on
tap
at
the
brewery
the
bottle
is
a
little
disapointing
to
be
honest
but
on
tap
this
beer
is
simply
amazing
fresh
cherries
and
soft
clean
crisp
malt
an
often
overlooked
and
laughed
at
beer
that
just
proves
sam
adams
still
makes
damn
good
beer
to
its
credit
another
decent
and
somewhat
refreshing
beer
from
sam
adams
in
my
opinion
sam
adams
sometimes
doesnt
get
the
credit
it
deserves
this
isnt
their
best
but
its
more
than
drinkable

translucent
tawnyorangeygold

very
nice

the
potency
of
the
cherries
which
seem
very
similar
to
pie
filling
is
ideally
strong
but
not
overbearing
the
invitation
is
well
received
the
palate
is
a
wheaty
cherry
pie
with
a
faint
hint
of
medicinal
qualities
like
cough
syrup
the
sweetness
is
present
but
not
cloying
the
tartness
is
very
distant
the
wheat
is
definitely
noticeable
the
finish
is
clean
curt
and
refreshing
more
so
than
expected
the
carbonation
is
ideal
the

cherry

rides
in

decent
enough
id
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
one
again
its
not
girly

try
one
fairly
potent
aroma
of
cherries
yet
not
really
overpowering
decent
enough
amber
color
and
a
bit
cloudy
the
taste
has
a
good
wheat
backbone
with
the
cherries
more
than
fairly
evident
a
little
more
cherry
and
it
would
be
too
much
very
good
but
i
cant
drink
too
many
of
them
i
will
say
up
front
that
i
am
typically
not
a
flavored
beer
fan
lambics
notwithstanding
this
one
by
sam
adams
is
actually
rather
refreshing
in
the
summer
months
if
you
are
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
the
wheat
aspect
of
the
beer
comes
through
rather
nicely
however
i
think
they
really
overdo
it
with
the
cherry
flavoring
as
it
does
tend
to
overpower
the
subtleties
of
this
brew
all
in
all
a
nice
addition
to
the
flavored
beer
arena
and
i
could
session
with
this
one
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
it
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
with
a
nice
blast
of
cherry
but
not
overwhelming
it
is
a
great
summerfall
beer
has
a
nice
wheatale
underlying
taste
not
like
a
regular
wheat
beer
but
a
definite
light
taste
would
go
great
with
the
right
meal
appears
an
amber
orange
filtered
hue
with
a
thin
cream
head
topping
it
off
aroma
is
full
of
artificial
marciano
cherry
esque
sweetness
almost
overbearingly
cherry
no
balance
from
anyother
aromas
in
there
just
potent
cherries
taste
well
in
the
background
some
malt
sweetness
along
with
the
same
bready
sam
adams
characteristic
flavor
that
exists
in
all
of
bbcs
beers
what
makes
this
beer
near
untolerable
is
the
rush
of
cherry
extract
that
becomes
cloying
and
not
drinkable
or
enjoyable
like
candy
mouthfeel
fizzy
carbonation
lighter
bodied
with
slight
syrupy
mouthfeel
to
it
drinkability
pass
on
this
gimmick
cherry
wheat
and
go
find
a
good
beer
pass
on
this
grotesque
cloying
answer
to
wheat
beer
fads
this
beer
has
an
emmaculent
apperance
clear
and
inviting
it
has
a
very
pleasing
aroma
as
well
it
has
an
excellent
taste
of
cherry
that
is
accompanied
by
a
nice
hint
of
malt
that
plays
against
the
cherry
very
well
i
typically
find
wheat
beers
to
be
a
bit
too
spicy
for
my
taste
but
this
wheat
beer
is
excellent
poured
a
standard
to
dark
yellow
with
a
bubbly
mediumsized
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
rising
up
smell
is

more
than
fresh
cherries
a

not
overly
sweet
thank
god
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
bitter
with
hints
of
cherry
lingering
pretty
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
the
cherry
syrup
flavor
wouldwill
prevent
me
from
drinking
this
often
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
this
style
calls
for
both
hazy
color
and
good
head
retention
the
aroma
is
out
of
this
world
the
sweet
smell
of
cherries
overpowers
you
at
first
smell
a
great
aroma
the
taste
however
is
pretty
weak
there
is
still
that
taste
of
cherries
but
its
not
as
strong
as
the
odor
there
is
also
a
very
clean
beer
taste
here
look
wheat
beers
are
supposed
to
be
hazy
they
are
supposed
to
taste
like
wheat
malt
not
pale
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
good
the
body
is
very
light
and
it
drinks
easy
again
wheat
beers
are
best
when
they
are
left
alone
these
big
breweries
think
they
need
to
clean
them
up
to
sell
more
but
in
the
process
they
lose
the
drinkers
that
got
them
going
a
dark
golden
with
a
rather
thick
foamy
head
the
obvious
aroma
is
of
cherry
and
malt
overtones
a
sharp
yet
pleasant
fruit
taste
creamy
cherry
pie
malt
in
the
background
bordering
on
medium
bodied
refreshing
and
not
too
overpowering
for
an
apa
taste
is
smooth
and
easy
pleasant
cherry
taste
and
not
anywhere
near
as
sweet
as
it
smells
decent
malt
balance
a
touch
of
yeast
and
slightly
more
than
average
carbonation
make
this
a
genuine
entry
for
a
fruit
flavored
beer
instead
of
just
dumping
in
some
fruit
juice
at
the
end
and
calling
it
so
a
good
beer
to
have
with
dessert
and
a
fine
session
brew
for
the
fall
or
spring
i
was
hoping
to
try
a
different
selection
from
the
boston
beer
factory
as
my
first
review
from
them
but
this
was
all
the
bar
had
poured
a
gold
colour
with
a
little
cloudy
haziness
sediment
whoof
smell
them
cherries
from
a
mile
away
wheat
too
and
a
little
other
grain
hey
i
dont
smell
adjunct
ill
be
damned
tasted
id
say
35000
too
sweet
just
a
little
sweeter
than
i
thought
had
to
mark
points
off
for
that
but
hey
the
wheat
is
detectable
on
the
palate
as
is
a
little
yeast
that
suited
this
beer
but
then
the
cherries
are
detected
hmm
didnt
like
it
i
dont
like
cherries
so
excuse
my
bias
the
cherry
flavour
seemed
a
little
like
childrens
cough
syrup
damn
but
thats
okay
i
still
like
this
beer
its
crisp
a
little
sourtart
and
i
do
taste
some
diacetyl
an
above
average
beer
my
advice
add
a
little
more
bitterness
and
a
little
less
cherries
i
ordered
this
beer
to
top
off
my
evening
after
eating
ribs
i
opened
it
up
and
was
struck
by
the
blatant
cherry
smell
it
poured
a
nice
white
head
that
slowly
discipated
the
tast
was
overwhelming
cherry
followed
by
wheat
it
was
very
smooth
but
lacked
a
nice
consistency
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
top
off
the
night
i
definitely
could
not
have
more
than
one
of
these
a
sitting
fortunately
i
think
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
uses
in
the
kithchen
aiba
2003
artificial
cherry
aroma
candy
like
flavours
sweetish
but
dries
out
a
touch
towards
the
end
abit
stupid
but
not
all
that
bad
maybe
a
nice
one
for
the
friend
who
doesnt
like
beer
or
anything
that
resembles
anything
complex
didnt
really
get
into
it
a
nice
limpid
golden
amber
to
copper
color
with
a
modest
head
and
decent
lace
to
coat
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
sweet
hint
of
cherries
and
the
underlying
malts
add
much
to
the
appeal
start
sweet
the
top
light
in
its
feel
the
finish
overly
acidic
the
hops
adequate
with
the
aftertaste
dry
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
im
wild
about
but
many
will
like
it
hazyish
orange
color
with
a
skim
head
that
persists
pretty
well
slightly
plastic
phenolic
aroma
cherry
smells
are
slightly
artificial
in
the
mountain
dew
code
red
category
slighly
husky
grainy
malt
flavors
cherry
is
mercifully
subdued
but
seeming
overly
sweet
to
my
tongue
mouthfeel
ranges
to
the
overcarbonated
side
for
me
but
finishes
fairly
dry
and
composed
in
aftertaste
lacks
the
pithy
astringency
of
a
welldone
lambic
but
this
brew
is
less
offensive
than
some
other
fruit
experimental
brews
from
this
side
of
the
pond
i
just
cant
recommend
it
as
drinkable
had
a
surprisingly
above
average
appearance
poured
a
giant
head
a
reduced
slowly
leaving
chunky
white
lace
everywhere
the
color
is
a
hazy
gold
to
an
almost
orange
aroma
is
all
cherries
and
smells
quite
good
has
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
a
light
body
with
no
real
malt
presence
extremely
light
with
a
sweet
cherry
taste
not
too
complex
here
could
use
more
malt
to
thickens
things
up
a
bit
light
and
refreshing
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
other
than
that
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
lacked
in
crispness
and
carbonation
this
isnt
a
bad
drink
i
will
admit
this
is
the
first
cherry
flavored
beer
that
i
have
had
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
not
much
of
a
head
on
the
pour
a
slightly
dark
yellow
color
it
does
taste
like
cherrys
but
it
is
not
too
overpowering
the
beer
flavor
still
comes
through
if
youre
going
to
be
sitting
outside
this
summer
i
would
say
give
it
a
try
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
far
exceded
my
expectations
it
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
first
thing
that
caught
me
was
the
smell
of
cheries
very
cool
the
taste
was
good
with
a
malty
start
then
the
cheries
kicked
in
then
a
little
bit
of
a
crisp
bitter
finnish
this
is
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
everyday
but
on
occation
it
would
work
very
well
pours
very
nicely
wheat
yellow
in
color
nice
head
and
lacing
typical
of
sa
the
smell
is
very
appealing
it
smells
of
cherries
but
not
overpoweringly
so
taste
is
rich
and
smooth
somewhat
sweet
you
get
the
cherry
and
wheat
flavors
mingling
well
this
is
a
special
occasion
beer
in
my
unsophisticated
opinion
great
price
for
a
beer
of
this
caliber
f
the
color
is
goldenorange
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
haze
white
head
on
top
which
stays
fairly
well
the
aroma
is
all
about
sweet
maraschino
cherries
i
think
im
getting
some
slight
metallic
aromas
as
well
that
could
just
be
the
cherries
though
either
way
that
aspect
of
the
aroma
isnt
the
most
pleasing
makes
it
smell
artificial
the
flavor
shows
more
promise
lots
of
cherries
again
but
backed
up
by
a
generous
amount
of
wheatymalty
character
especially
for
a
mediumbodied
beer
hop
bitterness
makes
it
crisp
and
clean
very
slightly
metallic
and
a
bit
artificial
tasting
but
hey
better
than
i
expected
it
could
use
some
work
though
had
this
ontap
at
the
sam
adams
brewhouse
in
boston
was
a
golden
color
with
a
fairly
small
head
nose
was
definitely
fruity
cherry
light
to
medium
bodied
taste
was
dry
wheat
malt
obvious
cherry
very
crisp
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
not
too
bad
ive
had
this
in
the
bottle
also
but
tap
is
better
this
brew
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
quarter
inch
white
head
and
good
lacing
actually
it
had
awesome
lacing
the
aroma
is
all
cherry
with
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
malty
note
i
expected
the
taste
to
be
all
cherry
as
well
but
much
to
my
surprise
it
was
not
i
mean
of
course
there
was
some
cherry
taste
but
it
wasnt
overwhelming
the
cherry
hits
up
front
followed
by
a
malty
sweetness
one
thing
i
didnt
like
about
the
cherry
flavor
it
seemed
artificial
i
was
expecting
a
natural
cherry
flavor
but
it
was
more
like
a
cherry
syrup
type
of
taste
i
looked
at
the
bottle
and
it
said
made
with
real
cherries
but
it
also
said
cherry
flavoring
added
overall
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
too
bad
it
surprised
me
it
wont
become
a
regular
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
this
beer
has
been
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
about
4
summers
now
it
has
sweetness
but
still
stays
refreshing
i
dont
think
the
cherry
flavor
is
overdone
either
over
all
a
bit
above
average
for
a
flavored
beer
in
my
book
drink
ability
is
ok
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
this
for
a
session
brew
but
a
few
here
and
there
i
could
do
that
i
was
offered
this
at
a
college
party
i
normally
dont
mine
fruity
brews
but
this
is
just
downright
aweful
yuck
i
taste
the
cherry
and
i
taste
the
wheat
but
why
does
it
have
to
taste
so
bad
the
balances
are
way
off
or
something
sam
adams
sure
messed
up
with
this
one
side
note
maybe
they
didnt
mess
up
because
this
seems
to
be
rather
popular
people
like
lousy
beer
though
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
reviewing
this
one
as
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
a
long
time
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
texas
summer
day
sitting
by
the
pool
and
waiting
for
the
steaks
to
go
on
the
grill
i
only
wish
i
could
have
given
the
appearance
a
better
score
so
that
this
beer
could
receive
a
perfect
5
a
really
nice
pour
with
a
good
cake
of
creamcolored
foam
and
effervescence
one
expects
in
a
wheat
beer
laces
nicely
throughout
the
drink
color
is
a
nearly
clear
goldnot
striking
but
certainly
not
unpleasant
candied
cherry
aromas
dominate
the
smell
while
appealing
these
notes
smother
the
wheat
more
than
balance
it
the
taste
is
more
even
than
the
smell
with
the
crisp
grains
melding
rather
nicely
with
the
cherry
flavors
which
are
a
bit
more
tart
than
those
found
in
the
nose
tastes
more
like
a
wheat
beer
as
the
cherry
taste
fades
away
into
a
rather
crisp
dry
finish
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
than
one
finds
in
many
fruit
beers
mouthfeel
is
stickier
than
in
typical
wheat
beers
and
the
strength
of
the
cherry
scents
and
flavors
likewise
makes
this
beer
less
appealing
that
most
wheats
quench
your
sweet
tooth
i
dont
know
what
i
was
thinking
giving
this
beer
a
decent
review
earlier
medium
amber
with
hint
of
red
color
moderately
carbonated
with
quickly
disappearing
head
syruppy
sweet
cherry
aroma
with
trace
of
almost
underfermented
beer
to
it
very
sweet
cloying
like
a
lollipop
slippery
mouthfeel
tastes
like
a
cheap
soda
skip
this
one
i
got
this
on
draft
and
it
arrived
with
a
thin
film
on
top
not
the
classic
head
as
from
the
bottle
i
wondered
why
anyway
all
good
from
there
it
even
managed
to
lace
fairly
well
this
is
my
favorite
fruit
standby
beer
from
its
aroma
to
taste
its
cherries
all
the
way
its
cherrypie
tart
slighty
sweet
but
yet
crisp
to
the
mouth
i
like
this
brew
anytime
of
year
its
just
that
good
pours
hazycloudy
golden
yellow
color
nice
big
creamy
white
head
leaves
a
clingy
lace
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
sweet
fruity
cherry
aroma
flavor
of
cherries
and
wheat
very
sweet
tart
cherry
flavor
almost
sour
i
guess
this
is
ok
for
a
fruit
beer
chery
wheat
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
taste
is
exceptional
the
flavor
excelllent
i
am
flabergasted
by
the
bad
reviews
about
this
beer
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
the
cherry
flavor
isnt
overpowering
this
is
a
great
beer
i
reccomend
it
for
anyone
auburn
color
with
a
thin
light
beige
head
very
strong
cherry
aroma
there
was
just
too
much
cherry
in
the
flavor
making
it
almost
sickeningly
sweet
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
cherries
more
like
the
cherry
flavoring
they
use
to
make
popsicles
or
something
i
honestly
didnt
bother
finishing
the
bottle
this
wasnt
horrible
but
they
really
need
to
tone
down
the
cherry
or
balance
it
better
with
more
malt
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
at
a
local
restaurant
and
it
was
summer
time
i
was
looking
for
a
good
wheat
beer
to
go
with
the
hogie
that
i
ordered
the
waitress
said
that
the
only
one
was
the
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
i
tried
it
and
was
suprised
how
good
this
one
was
since
i
was
going
in
blind
the
cherry
was
there
but
not
over
powering
with
no
after
taste
this
was
a
very
smooth
tasting
beer
left
the
mouth
with
a
nice
feeling
not
to
full
enjoyed
this
so
much
that
i
went
out
the
next
day
and
bought
a
case
great
thirst
quencher
for
any
time
of
year
like
cherry
coke
the
fascination
made
me
try
this
one
it
had
the
same
effect
i
t
tasted
like
someone
had
dropped
a
halls
brothers
cough
drop
into
a
beer
and
refused
to
dump
it
the
cherry
is
very
annoying
hazy
gold
with
a
decent
head
that
retains
a
very
nice
lace
cherry
aroma
hits
immediatly
crisp
and
dry
with
some
cherry
flavor
and
bitterness
very
refreshing
but
not
what
to
get
when
looking
for
a
beer
good
for
a
change
of
pace
during
the
dog
days
of
summer
definitely
not
my
favorite
beer
or
even
my
favorite
sa
has
a
slightly
sour
medicinal
quality
to
the
cherry
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
not
much
to
back
it
up
im
starting
the
think
that
wheat
beers
just
werent
meant
to
be
fruit
flavored
nice
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
head
the
bubbles
are
not
that
tight
but
ok
the
head
lasts
really
well
and
leaves
a
little
belgianlace
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
fruity
and
yes
cherry
with
sweet
malt
a
touch
candyish
but
not
off
putting
in
any
way
it
has
a
medium
body
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
the
flavor
has
a
good
combination
of
fruit
and
sweet
very
lightly
caramel
malt
it
does
develop
a
somewhat
medicinal
cherry
cough
drop
flavor
after
a
few
sips
theres
very
little
bitterness
and
yet
it
doesnt
seem
cloying
although
it
does
seem
to
coat
the
tongue
must
be
the
combination
of
residual
malt
sugars
and
extract
flavor
the
finish
is
limited
but
the
aftertaste
lingers
and
seems
to
flip
flop
between
a
nice
fruitiness
and
the
medicinal
quality
overall
this
beer
seems
to
have
improved
over
the
years
a
nice
change
of
pace
during
the
hot
summer
months
the
hazy
orange
amber
hued
brew
is
topped
by
a
fairly
dense
ivory
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
lace
down
the
glass
cherry
absolutely
overwhelms
the
aroma
and
is
quite
overbearing
any
other
malt
notes
or
hop
nose
is
completely
masked
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
a
cloying
cherry
extract
flavor
and
as
the
beer
warms
an
odd
marzipan
flavor
becomes
noticeable
this
beer
is
an
epitomy
of
inbalance
the
fruit
extract
prevents
the
malt
profile
to
surface
finishes
sweet
w
a
lingering
offputting
sugary
cherry
candy
sweetness
there
are
fruit
beers
that
are
drinkable
this
is
not
one
of
them
this
is
a
very
nice
fruit
wheat
beer
the
most
dominant
characteristic
is
the
cherry
aroma
its
inescapable
nice
wheatbeer
haze
in
a
deep
golden
color
the
beer
has
a
decent
sized
white
head
and
a
pleasing
balance
not
as
sweet
as
i
anticipated
the
first
one
i
had
didnt
have
a
real
strong
cherry
taste
to
it
but
after
that
i
have
had
a
few
that
you
can
barely
taste
the
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
it
and
that
is
all
i
can
say
it
goes
down
great
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
true
beer
it
is
not
what
you
are
looking
for
it
is
very
fruity
this
is
tasty
lighter
brew
with
more
than
a
hint
of
the
fruit
within
i
found
it
to
be
very
popular
among
the
notintobeer
crowd
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
summer
night
i
used
to
think
this
was
the
best
beer
i
could
buy
in
florida
then
i
started
to
look
around
i
had
it
again
after
about
a
year
without
goldenreddish
color
nice
fuzzy
head
smells
like
a
bowl
full
of
cherries
after
drinking
quality
wheat
beers
i
think
this
tastes
more
like
a
pilsner
or
light
lager
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
very
bubbly
carbonated
and
heavily
flavored
after
the
first
couple
drinks
the
cherry
fizziness
seems
to
dominate
no
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
please
i
think
the
marin
blueberry
and
peach
ale
is
more
subtle
and
balanced
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
nice
looking
beer
with
a
deep
amber
color
and
nice
long
lasting
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
all
cherry
with
a
hint
of
cough
syrup
its
got
the
mouth
feel
of
a
wheat
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
very
prevalent
and
lasts
a
long
long
time
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
slightly
hazy
light
copper
in
color
minimal
head
which
disappears
quickly
pleasant
light
cherry
aroma
tastes
of
sweet
cherries
but
its
certainly
not
too
sweet
or
overbearing
light
bodied
and
one
can
detect
the
wheat
malt
used
a
very
crisp
and
dry
finish
not
a
bad
beer
and
would
be
a
good
summertime
quaffer
nice
rich
red
doesnt
quite
hold
a
head
though
smells
like
a
basket
of
cherries
soaked
in
gingerale
pleasant
but
not
overbearing
taste
a
bit
thin
and
a
bit
too
sweet
on
the
finish
really
a
good
beer
overall
though
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
very
fruity
smell
the
cherry
taste
is
good
but
not
overbearing
a
refreshing
beer
im
good
for
a
sixer
to
two
of
this
every
year
any
more
than
that
and
the
cherry
taste
gets
a
bit
much
one
of
my
favorite
beers
pours
a
nice
reddishbrown
and
the
smell
is
delicious
this
definitely
isnt
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
in
mass
quantities
its
more
of
a
sippin
a
few
with
the
boys
beer
or
a
dessert
beer
the
cherry
taste
is
definitely
present
but
is
not
overwhelming
i
have
found
this
to
be
a
beer
that
people
either
love
or
hate
and
i
love
it
definitely
worth
trying
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
dominated
by
tart
cherries
and
wheat
undertones
taste
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
tart
cherries
and
alcohol
come
across
strongly
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
crisp
and
refreshing
a
very
nice
summer
beer
i
love
sam
adams
but
the
cherry
taste
was
just
to
much
not
balanced
at
all
again
a
nice
changeup
but
i
doubt
id
purchase
this
again
if
i
am
looking
for
a
lighthearted
drinkable
brew
ill
stick
with
some
sort
of
hefeweizen
when
i
was
first
introducing
the
wife
to
the
wonderful
world
of
beer
this
was
a
favorite
of
hers
not
bad
really
kind
of
a
nice
tarty
changeup
from
the
usual
hazy
appearance
with
light
cherry
flavor
and
a
somewhat
effervescent
mouthfeel
background
with
this
beer
notes
a
great
mix
of
flavours
for
a
decent
fruit
beer
nice
and
refreshing
its
an
okay
fruit
beer
but
calling
it
a
lambic
is
ridiculous
to
call
this
a
lambic
is
an
insult
to
the
entire
country
of
belgium
no
words
for
how
awful
this
is
cheers
to
rinse
my
mouth
out
with
almost
anything
else
but
there
is
hope
i
use
this
stuff
to
cook
with
all
the
time
during
the
winter
and
its
great
try
putting
it
in
a
slow
cooker
with
some
chicken
breast
veggies
a
can
of
cream
of
mushroom
soup
and
some
garlic
awesome
i
got
this
beer
a
few
times
in
the
samuel
adams
winter
mix
packs
this
beer
each
year
was
by
far
the
worst
of
the
bunch
the
cranberry
tartness
is
just
way
over
the
top
its
like
drinking
a
sour
hard
candy
if
they
lightened
up
on
the
cranberry
it
might
not
be
that
bad
this
was
an
average
fruit
beer
the
flavor
was
a
little
too
light
but
it
wasnt
bad
has
an
extremely
muddy
and
murky
sort
of
sangria
brown
orange
red
and
a
single
finger
of
light
pink
foam
that
dies
to
a
scum
layer
in
a
minute
without
lacing
i
am
disappointed
that
this
brew
is
mislabeled
as
lambic
on
the
bottle
label
there
is
no
aroma
or
flavor
of
wild
yeast
esters
no
sourness
at
all
to
this
brew
there
is
a
vaguely
tart
but
mostly
sweet
cranberry
presence
and
a
fairly
generic
wheat
malt
and
that
is
all
texture
is
light
and
carbonation
is
high
enough
for
a
soda
popis
this
a
beer
or
an
alcopop
the
fact
that
is
it
is
difficult
to
tell
does
not
bode
well
if
a
beer
has
a
word
printed
on
the
label
i
fully
expect
to
have
the
promise
of
that
word
delivered
to
me
by
the
contents
of
the
bottle
i
am
disappointed
sam
adams
very
disappointed
the
great
majority
of
my
problems
with
this
brew
could
have
been
prevented
by
simply
refraining
from
lying
on
the
label
of
the
beer
overall
a
standard
lambic
drinkable
but
not
special
or
memorable
o
good
but
not
great
now
enough
cranberry
also
not
sweet
like
lindemans
then
again
they
back
sweeten
their
american
styles
wouldnt
get
again
as
it
wasnt
stellar
od
not
bad
but
comes
across
as
a
cranberry
wheat
beer
as
opposed
to
a
lambic
one
or
two
would
be
okay
but
the
acidic
nature
would
certainly
become
too
much
for
me
beyond
that
a
decent
beer
overall
o
not
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
not
by
a
longshot
at
least
i
can
say
i
tried
it
overall
i
think
this
might
have
been
my
favorite
out
of
the
holiday
sampler
appearance
is
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
smells
very
tart
and
fruity
with
a
yeast
and
wheat
undertone
tastes
like
cranberry
wheat
beer
nothing
special
really
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
it
is
just
ok
for
a
wheatfruit
beer
but
refreshing
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
everyday
pale
or
wheat
ales
o
this
lambic
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
feel
like
they
played
it
too
safe
and
it
came
out
too
bland
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
lambic
o
well
actually
great
for
women
maybe
their
plan
was
to
trick
people
into
thinking
it
was
a
lambic
with
the
tartness
or
sourness
of
cranberries
even
if
not
sam
adams
bad
job
on
this
one
not
a
bad
cranberry
wheat
but
definitely
not
a
lambic
no
discernible
wild
character
at
all
and
based
on
the
vague
label
description
its
not
totally
unexpected
the
beer
is
okay
with
nice
cranberry
flavor
but
its
overly
wheaty
for
what
i
would
expect
the
mf
was
ok
and
overall
i
didnt
hate
the
beer
1111
09
vintage
not
even
sure
if
its
available
at
all
was
in
six
packs
the
other
year
might
buy
a
six
of
this
for
fun
maybe
just
a
single
as
bad
as
that
may
sound
its
not
really
bad
in
fact
its
pretty
good
in
an
unusual
way
overalli
was
fooled
on
the
name
and
should
have
realized
when
it
was
32
for
a
case
of
lambic
othe
problem
is
that
although
it
tasted
ok
the
carbonation
did
me
in
it
drank
more
like
a
smirnoff
cranberry
than
a
beer
o
judging
by
the
reviews
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
disaster
it
really
wasnt
bad
at
all
in
fact
quite
enjoyable
sure
its
not
a
true
lambic
but
its
really
a
nice
go
at
it
by
an
american
brewery
it
really
smells
like
cranberries
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
lemon
cranberry
tartness
without
bitterness
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
despite
it
being
six
months
out
of
date
will
be
looking
forward
to
a
fresh
batch
at
christmas
pours
a
nice
reddishorange
smells
of
sweet
cranberry
possibly
a
little
overpowering
but
not
too
bad
judging
by
the
appearance
and
smell
i
thought
this
would
be
a
decent
beer
then
i
took
a
drink
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
beer
and
metallic
cranberries
i
barely
managed
to
drink
one
gave
the
others
away
ha
ha
sorry
suckers
this
beer
is
the
worst
samuel
adams
offering
in
my
opinion
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
about
a
quarter
inch
of
foam
on
top
of
a
hazy
beer
the
appearance
was
an
interesting
shade
of
reddish
brown
the
aroma
was
sour
and
malty
not
too
pronounced
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
i
am
a
big
cranberry
fan
and
really
enjoy
the
sours
the
flavor
lacked
the
sour
punch
of
a
belgian
this
may
be
due
to
the
beer
being
4
months
past
its
april
date
if
you
like
tartsour
you
may
enjoy
if
not
dont
bother
well
maybe
you
should
bother
just
to
be
familiar
with
the
style
though
im
sure
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
be
purchasing
again
not
bad
not
great
a
shave
above
average
elimination
of
the
aftertaste
would
make
this
a
great
gateway
beer
first
time
i
ha
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
cometely
undrinkable
i
had
a
few
sips
and
dumped
it
out
i
was
given
another
bottle
as
a
gift
some
time
later
and
gave
it
another
try
this
time
it
was
much
better
the
red
color
was
always
attractive
to
me
but
the
idea
of
cranberry
isnt
for
me
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
them
so
naturally
this
brew
wouldnt
please
me
for
this
who
enjoy
cranberry
do
try
this
youll
probably
enjoy
it
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
orange
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
quickly
dissipating
mostly
white
head
smells
malty
and
grainy
taste
is
not
too
impressive
definitely
taste
the
wheat
though
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
aftertaste
from
the
cranberry
coming
through
very
bubbly
feel
not
too
drinkable
in
my
mind
probably
would
get
sick
of
this
after
a
couple
poured
a
murky
light
red
in
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
with
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
that
of
bready
malts
and
cranberries
and
well
as
a
light
scent
of
spice
it
tasted
sweet
and
acidic
with
a
heavy
cranberry
wine
like
flavor
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
in
texture
with
a
light
to
medium
body
overall
a
nice
flavored
brew
d
can
barely
finish
one
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
lambics
i
have
had
from
belgium
are
definitely
my
favs
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
couldnt
wait
for
another
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
boston
beer
offerings
its
not
a
lambic
but
it
shines
out
in
its
difficult
category
its
a
polarizing
brew
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
i
love
it
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
one
on
the
bottom
100
too
it
pours
a
very
cloudy
and
murky
cranberry
red
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
has
a
light
pink
tint
to
it
the
aromas
are
pretty
subdued
it
smells
of
light
sour
cranberries
with
some
light
wheatyeast
accents
the
flavors
though
are
really
bland
id
say
this
is
like
the
cranberry
version
of
blue
moon
it
disappoints
it
drinks
fine
has
decent
body
and
is
smooth
enough
if
i
had
to
drink
this
again
i
wouldnt
mind
too
much
but
id
never
buy
it
again
i
had
to
try
it
because
its
a
sam
adams
lambic
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
about
edit
now
that
ive
read
the
posts
from
more
pro
beer
advocates
i
guess
my
talk
of
it
being
close
to
the
styles
are
inaccurate
but
i
will
keep
the
scores
the
same
pours
a
hazy
reddish
purple
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
some
malts
and
very
slight
cranberries
tastes
of
vague
cranberries
malts
and
some
wheat
drinkability
is
poor
its
quite
nasty
although
i
wish
theyd
offer
it
at
more
than
the
holiday
season
it
is
definitely
a
good
way
to
ring
them
in
overall
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
this
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
vilify
it
for
its
false
labeling
interesting
for
what
it
is
ill
gladly
drink
it
some
other
time
another
fine
and
enjoyable
brew
from
samuel
adams
i
need
to
explore
the
belgian
lambics
now
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
body
is
nice
light
reddish
color
with
2
of
nice
white
head
on
top
the
smell
is
light
and
fruity
not
much
else
its
taste
is
smooth
and
a
little
sweet
of
cranberries
there
is
no
hop
or
malt
taste
that
i
can
taste
it
has
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
and
i
think
is
nice
and
drinkable
dnot
what
i
would
label
or
call
a
lambic
as
far
as
pour
taste
ect
go
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
consider
them
refreshing
taste
would
be
great
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
maybe
but
as
far
as
a
winter
brew
maybe
not
notes
clearly
not
a
lambic
i
feel
like
i
should
join
a
support
group
my
name
is
phelps
and
i
like
cranberry
lambic
d
it
taste
like
crap
so
i
give
it
a
1
d
the
drinkability
is
not
too
good
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
there
is
just
nothing
about
it
that
is
really
good
i
do
not
recommend
d
i
dont
like
cranberries
at
all
and
i
dont
like
this
beer
stared
at
a
couple
of
these
in
the
fridge
for
way
to
long
d
wouldnt
be
happy
about
a
whole
six
pack
of
these
glad
i
only
bought
two
carbonation
level
ok
though
for
what
it
is
12
oz
bottle
pours
hazy
orange
with
foamy
redish
head
aroma
of
cranberry
yeast
brown
sugar
and
some
hints
of
banana
medium
sweet
body
flavor
of
cranberries
brown
sugar
with
some
yeasty
notes
finish
is
long
and
sweet
good
thirst
quencher
should
be
good
with
desserts
too
i
had
my
doubts
about
sam
adams
making
a
cranberry
lambic
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
pours
a
dirty
ruby
red
color
with
foam
everywhere
the
nose
was
a
lacking
but
had
nice
hints
of
cranberry
sugar
and
fruits
taste
is
a
blend
of
tart
cranberry
wheat
carbonation
and
sweet
and
sour
sam
adams
cranberry
lambic
is
decent
but
no
lakefront
rosie
overall
this
one
drinks
like
a
light
amberwheat
ale
that
has
some
mildly
sour
berry
flavoring
added
in
just
like
the
label
promises
in
this
regard
i
would
say
that
it
is
to
the
beer
world
what
that
canned
cranberry
sauce
is
to
thanksgiving
dinner
it
isnt
as
good
as
fresh
wholeberry
cranberry
relish
but
im
still
going
to
scoop
some
onto
my
plate
if
its
the
available
option
reddish
maroon
body
on
a
vigorous
pour
yields
a
small
white
head
this
dissipates
to
a
few
bubbles
around
the
edges
smells
slightly
sweet
slight
bit
of
earthiness
tastes
sweet
to
tart
and
back
to
sweet
fruitiness
creamy
medium
body
mouthfeel
i
could
only
handle
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
ill
probably
try
this
again
next
year
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
redish
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
it
had
a
sweet
cranberry
like
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
cranberry
easy
to
drink
low
carbonation
not
really
a
lambic
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
if
you
didnt
like
cranberry
you
wouldnt
like
this
at
all
d
not
a
true
lambic
more
of
a
fruit
beer
as
it
is
categorized
here
so
expectations
should
not
be
for
a
true
lambic
taste
they
probably
should
have
called
it
cranberry
wheat
this
brew
isnt
terrible
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
it
wont
be
a
stocked
item
in
my
frig
but
it
was
worth
a
try
this
is
not
the
finest
brew
sam
adams
has
put
out
but
it
certainly
is
unique
id
like
to
give
credit
on
a
good
attempt
bottle
ok
so
this
is
obviously
not
a
lambic
in
any
sense
of
the
word
so
as
such
i
will
rate
it
as
a
fruit
beer
not
sure
why
sam
adams
decided
to
call
this
a
lambic
when
clearly
it
isnt
poured
into
a
nb
tulip
glass
pours
an
apaque
rust
mahagony
color
with
tinges
of
red
the
head
is
a
big
fluffy
2
finger
head
with
a
very
slight
red
tinge
head
laces
as
it
settles
the
aroma
is
slightly
similiar
to
a
hef
with
banana
and
clove
notes
with
an
ever
so
slight
berry
note
the
taste
is
ahhh
not
that
great
to
be
honest
not
competely
terrible
but
not
all
that
great
either
again
i
get
more
of
a
slight
hef
flavor
with
cloves
some
mild
and
i
mean
mild
tartness
from
what
i
am
guessing
is
the
cranberry
medium
mouthfeel
slight
bitterness
in
the
end
with
some
sweetness
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
the
smell
is
sourish
with
hints
of
cranberries
the
taste
is
sour
this
is
the
first
lambic
that
i
have
tried
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
beer
style
may
be
one
of
those
ones
that
requires
an
acquired
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
almost
medium
i
dont
find
this
beer
drinkable
o
an
unusual
lambic
that
is
not
so
sweet
as
to
be
delegated
to
dessert
beer
should
pair
well
with
some
foods
well
so
on
top
of
all
that
i
read
on
the
bottle
that
it
has
maple
syrup
added
in
why
damn
you
sam
adams
youve
tricked
me
again
i
will
stick
with
your
oktoberfest
when
i
want
something
from
you
murky
amber
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
a
fizzy
cap
appeared
during
the
pour
subsided
fairly
quickly
and
had
a
beigerose
hue
spotty
lacing
sour
wheat
aroma
coupled
with
mustyearthy
berry
and
lemon
notes
banana
cranberry
and
slight
clove
as
it
warmed
pretty
strong
and
not
appealing
to
me
the
flavour
was
mostly
fruity
cranberry
and
lemon
with
some
malt
sweetness
up
front
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
clove
spice
lingered
fairly
dry
with
average
carbonation
that
was
on
the
coarse
side
medium
bodied
although
it
tasted
all
right
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
past
the
aroma
each
time
i
went
for
a
sip
i
found
that
exhaling
during
a
sip
was
the
best
way
to
avoid
the
unpleasantness
not
the
worst
fruit
beer
ive
had
but
not
one
that
id
have
again
either
d
first
off
this
is
not
a
lambic
this
is
nothing
close
to
a
lambic
and
sam
adams
should
put
a
disclaimer
on
the
bottle
that
even
though
it
says
its
a
lambic
it
really
is
not
this
one
makes
it
into
the
ranks
of
triple
bock
with
its
greatness
or
lack
there
of
after
my
tasting
of
this
i
went
to
the
bathroom
and
wiped
my
tongue
down
using
comet
and
a
brillo
pad
it
has
been
4
days
and
still
all
i
can
taste
is
sam
adams
cranberry
lambic
well
maybe
thats
not
true
but
i
think
its
pretty
bad
overall
a
misleading
title
simply
awful
looks
smells
and
tastes
and
utter
undrinkability
this
a
howard
the
duck
level
fiasco
a
total
dud
of
a
beer
shame
on
samuel
adams
for
even
having
this
available
let
alone
in
regular
rotation
overall
this
beer
was
just
ok
not
great
tastes
decent
i
think
sam
adams
wanted
to
make
a
beer
that
wasnt
overly
sweettart
because
americans
arent
really
used
to
the
style
i
think
its
pretty
cool
that
they
decided
to
take
it
out
of
the
winter
classics
12pk
and
make
it
into
a
6pk
i
think
this
would
probably
go
really
well
with
turkey
hmmm
this
did
come
out
right
before
thanksgiving
chuckles
sarcasm
glad
i
tried
it
but
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
pours
a
faint
amber
orange
color
with
an
off
white
head
nose
is
loads
of
cranberry
juice
the
taste
adds
in
a
bit
of
caramel
but
this
makes
it
taste
more
like
some
caramel
candies
have
been
soaking
in
a
glass
of
slightlycarbonated
cranberry
juice
cocktail
overnight
feel
is
a
bit
cloying
and
a
bit
tart
poor
drinkability
many
of
the
winter
pack
beers
are
pretty
decent
this
one
is
not
first
off
not
a
true
lambic
but
more
of
a
fruit
ale
the
beer
as
part
of
the
holiday
pack
was
the
one
i
dreaded
finishing
the
worst
or
actually
the
only
one
i
dreaded
a
very
sour
beer
typical
of
lambics
with
a
bad
aftertaste
overall
very
disappointing
from
boston
beer
co
dont
consider
this
a
lambic
fresh
puke
after
eating
too
many
cranberries
d
this
beer
is
not
terribly
potent
in
smell
or
taste
and
has
a
nice
look
and
mouthfeel
that
said
this
beer
is
by
no
means
drinkable
the
flavor
is
literally
nauseating
i
would
serve
this
only
to
an
enemy
or
very
drunk
friend
taste
brutally
sacharrin
sweet
rough
why
people
hate
this
but
not
all
the
other
lambics
i
dont
know
none
of
them
are
for
me
but
this
was
one
you
could
try
without
taking
out
a
mortgage
never
again
instead
of
cantillon
no
redeeming
quality
here
other
than
maybe
the
smell
of
cranberries
and
artificial
coffee
sweetener
thats
it
enjoy
i
tried
this
several
years
ago
and
remember
hating
it
not
sure
what
is
different
this
time
but
i
didnt
dislike
it
even
though
i
went
in
expecting
to
d
ive
tasted
some
lindeman
lambics
which
i
thought
were
superior
and
would
gladly
have
seconds
no
need
for
another
here
drinkability
not
very
its
hard
to
get
past
the
sour
taste
to
drink
another
i
have
a
feeling
this
would
be
decent
with
thanksgiving
dinner
or
with
a
heavy
meal
to
dull
the
sweet
and
sour
but
the
swing
is
rather
extreme
its
just
too
much
to
call
this
anything
but
average
at
best
it
is
quite
pretty
though
the
rest
is
a
let
down
i
have
limited
experience
with
fruit
lambics
but
i
can
tell
you
this
is
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
smells
pretty
good
upfront
and
has
the
color
of
cloudy
cider
the
head
is
thin
and
fleeting
at
first
it
has
a
intense
wheat
taste
that
is
dominated
fruit
and
malt
the
lingering
taste
turns
bitter
and
dull
and
although
still
retains
a
cranberry
taste
it
lacks
the
original
intensity
and
sweetness
could
have
been
a
little
better
but
theyre
on
the
right
track
with
this
lambic
rating
by
tommy
from
brewfanatics
com
i
cant
help
but
compare
this
beer
to
a
similar
cranberry
beer
new
glarus
cranbic
ale
while
cranbic
is
superior
in
every
way
cranberry
lambic
is
still
a
good
choice
for
anyone
seeking
a
mild
crowdpleasing
fruit
beer
for
the
holidays
tastes
like
a
ricola
cough
drop
that
has
been
left
in
a
dirty
kitty
litter
box
for
a
few
weeks
hints
of
nyquil
and
sudafed
will
haunt
my
dreams
for
the
next
four
days
after
drinking
this
foul
concoction
why
on
earth
would
anyone
actually
want
to
imbibe
this
insanity
i
can
hear
geico
money
taunting
me
from
the
lip
of
the
glass
which
hates
me
forever
now
btw
yes
there
is
some
cranberry
flavors
here
but
they
are
neither
appealing
nor
tasty
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
i
know
it
will
continue
to
torment
me
as
i
buy
at
least
one
winter
mix
pack
each
year
surely
there
is
some
evil
soul
that
i
can
pawn
these
off
on
overall
cranberry
lambic
was
very
difficult
to
judge
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
nor
do
i
like
cranberries
all
that
much
but
i
tried
to
be
as
open
minded
as
possible
everything
about
it
was
average
except
the
taste
was
better
than
the
smell
would
have
led
me
to
believe
not
too
bad
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
almost
seems
more
like
something
i
would
expect
from
magic
hat
rather
than
sam
adams
picked
this
one
up
in
a
christmas
sampler
cranberry
beer
is
a
new
one
to
be
but
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
poured
a
hazy
thin
strawberry
blond
color
smelled
well
like
cranberries
and
a
mildy
tartness
the
first
sip
was
disgusting
it
had
that
acrid
throw
up
taste
i
took
another
sip
yuck
sour
cranberries
and
some
wheaty
bile
two
sips
was
enough
for
me
this
one
went
down
the
drain
avoid
this
one
unless
you
enjoy
cranberries
mixed
with
stomach
contents
every
year
i
pawn
these
off
on
unsuspecting
friends
and
the
one
person
i
know
who
likes
this
beer
got
to
get
my
annual
fezziweg
so
i
keep
buying
the
samplers
alright
well
este
amigo
said
this
color
reminds
him
of
the
red
tide
yep
and
growing
up
on
the
gulf
coast
red
tide
is
never
a
good
thing
this
is
the
same
thank
you
baby
jesus
this
is
a
seasonal
offering
the
attack
is
strong
cranberry
then
it
almost
taste
like
a
smoothie
with
other
spoiled
berries
and
it
isnt
very
appealing
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
even
if
you
find
it
on
sale
like
i
did
no
thank
you
definitely
a
study
in
contrasts
its
really
rather
pretty
with
the
pink
head
smells
okay
bits
of
fruit
and
malt
i
guess
its
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
my
room
mate
just
loves
it
were
okay
though
as
next
time
we
get
a
samuel
adams
winter
sampler
pack
ill
give
her
my
cranberry
and
ill
have
her
boston
lager
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
to
my
liking
i
cant
even
really
say
why
a
bit
sweeter
than
id
like
and
just
nothing
that
stands
out
and
says
im
great
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
one
i
do
look
forward
to
during
the
holidays
i
never
was
fond
of
this
beer
however
for
some
reason
this
time
around
i
acually
found
myself
enjoying
this
i
still
wouldnt
pick
up
a
six
of
it
but
it
is
not
the
dreaded
last
bottles
of
the
winter
sampler
orangy
copper
colored
creamy
offwhite
head
ok
lacing
smell
is
of
musty
wet
grains
and
faint
cranberry
flavored
beverage
taste
is
akin
to
an
artifically
sweetened
partially
artificial
partially
real
cranberry
flavored
juice
product
think
contains
20
real
cranberry
nice
carbonation
nice
medium
body
mouthfeel
saves
this
beer
wasnt
as
horrible
as
i
exepected
artifical
tasting
not
a
true
lambic
in
any
sense
but
decent
body
d
not
a
lambic
a
true
lambic
would
really
stand
out
in
the
seasonal
mixer
pack
but
it
might
scare
a
few
folks
this
is
much
more
approachable
but
it
is
more
of
a
fruit
wheat
beer
judged
as
such
it
would
probably
rate
a
touch
higher
held
to
strict
lambic
criteria
it
would
come
in
even
lower
not
a
bad
brew
but
sort
of
mislabeled
d
sorry
just
not
for
me
its
a
two
part
problem
its
nasty
in
the
nose
and
thin
and
watery
on
the
tongue
the
label
calls
this
brew
a
lambic
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
which
i
have
not
experienced
it
is
not
to
my
liking
it
doesnt
mean
it
is
a
bad
brew
just
not
in
my
taste
zone
sa
cranberry
lambic
tastes
more
like
a
fruit
beer
not
my
favorite
style
either
d
cant
say
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
again
but
its
definitely
decent
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
big
bubbly
off
white
head
that
disapates
into
a
foamy
ring
with
no
lacing
very
hazy
orangeamber
color
you
can
smell
the
cranberries
and
as
it
warms
you
get
hints
of
maple
syrup
high
carbination
in
mouth
very
sour
in
taste
cranberries
and
a
slight
maple
sweetnes
finish
this
brew
is
an
aquired
taste
and
i
do
enjoy
one
or
two
now
and
then
but
no
more
than
that
this
is
however
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
use
in
cooking
makes
great
beercan
chicken
and
for
the
first
time
i
cooked
a
beercan
turkey
this
christmas
using
this
beer
the
flavor
is
an
also
juicy
cranberry
sweetness
with
a
tart
under
taste
that
makes
this
pretty
different
and
very
tasty
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
big
and
nice
fruity
flavor
and
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
in
a
beer
then
this
is
for
you
cheers
i
have
grown
to
like
this
beer
more
than
i
did
at
first
but
it
still
is
not
one
i
would
every
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
of
my
least
favorites
of
sam
adams
cherry
worse
this
would
go
fine
with
honey
ham
or
other
sweet
spicy
fare
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
serve
to
others
notes
if
you
score
this
according
to
the
style
its
absolutely
horrible
it
isnt
really
anything
like
a
true
lambic
however
if
you
score
it
on
its
own
merits
it
improves
slightly
the
smell
needs
work
but
i
think
the
flavors
could
be
refined
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
and
it
looks
decent
like
all
sam
adams
serving
type
bottle
d
once
again
meh
i
will
drink
this
but
do
not
want
another
ever
im
not
sure
about
this
one
ive
had
it
straight
from
the
bottle
and
the
improvement
gained
by
pouring
it
is
unbelievable
still
its
a
novelty
beer
and
i
dont
know
if
i
could
sit
down
with
a
pitcher
of
this
over
an
evening
slightly
above
average
marks
for
making
me
wonder
if
it
would
be
worth
trying
pours
a
cloudy
cranberry
colored
red
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
slightly
vegetable
like
with
an
additional
spicy
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
vaguely
fruity
but
overall
it
just
tastes
a
little
off
perhaps
a
little
vegetable
like
with
a
lack
of
carbonation
that
prevents
the
fruitiness
from
actually
being
refreshing
overallnotes
samuel
adams
i
am
become
disappoint
the
winter
pack
is
such
a
mixed
bag
this
beer
isnt
good
at
all
and
it
is
not
a
lambic
ive
only
had
2
lambics
during
the
earliest
of
my
good
beer
drinking
days
and
this
is
not
what
those
were
shame
on
you
in
other
words
look
for
something
else
and
if
you
bought
the
winter
pack
well
the
winter
lager
and
old
fezziwig
should
keep
you
distracted
long
enough
that
this
is
just
a
footnote
drinkability
ok
ok
cranberry
flavor
average
beer
at
best
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
nothing
about
it
really
impressed
me
its
a
pretty
cherryred
color
with
little
carbonation
the
aroma
was
an
overwhelming
amount
of
cranberry
which
should
have
been
an
indication
of
the
impending
disaster
the
taste
was
fruity
but
had
a
signifigant
sourness
to
it
that
i
found
very
ofensive
my
tongue
was
stinging
for
some
time
after
i
had
this
and
the
beer
i
had
following
this
did
not
mix
well
with
it
i
actually
felt
the
need
to
leave
the
party
i
was
at
but
toughed
it
out
i
will
never
try
this
one
again
fail
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
very
hazy
cranberry
color
with
a
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
nothing
the
aroma
is
heavy
of
cranberry
citrus
and
some
banana
the
taste
is
very
thin
lots
of
carbonation
and
mostly
banana
and
cranberry
flavor
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
berry
flavor
brews
and
dont
like
the
lightness
of
this
was
part
of
a
variety
pack
so
nothing
really
lost
d
not
a
bad
beer
nice
to
see
bbc
doing
something
like
this
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
my
girlfriend
really
likes
it
im
ready
to
toss
it
about
halfway
through
pours
a
reddishpurple
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
kinda
looks
like
a
glass
of
grape
juice
nice
color
though
smell
is
basically
sour
berries
a
little
offputting
taste
is
well
cranberry
tartness
little
bread
aftertaste
not
bad
really
somewhat
refreshing
just
kinda
onedimensional
and
eh
i
dont
think
its
as
bad
as
everyone
says
but
id
rather
just
drink
some
cranberry
juice
after
a
few
more
sips
and
adjusting
the
drinkablility
increases
as
the
taste
becomes
seemingly
more
balanced
i
wouldnt
session
this
the
taste
was
very
fruity
not
very
much
like
my
experiece
with
a
true
lambic
but
still
very
good
the
cranberry
accents
are
strong
and
more
than
a
little
sweet
sweeter
than
some
of
my
favorite
lambics
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
the
flavor
hangs
on
the
tongue
though
the
sweetness
is
a
little
stronger
than
i
would
have
preferred
as
with
most
fruit
beers
it
was
good
for
a
single
beer
but
i
woudnt
want
to
drink
more
than
that
at
a
sitting
the
label
on
the
bottle
says
to
try
cranberry
lambic
with
dessert
but
a
heavy
ale
or
stout
is
a
far
better
finish
to
a
meal
in
past
years
ive
drainpoured
both
bottles
of
this
disaster
however
this
year
i
drank
half
a
bottle
for
this
review
ill
need
many
beers
to
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
a
big
disappointment
here
unfortunately
hardly
a
lambic
this
seems
more
like
a
blend
of
a
rather
unexciting
wheat
beer
mixed
with
a
bit
of
cranberry
or
cranberry
ale
even
as
that
i
just
didnt
find
it
very
interesting
at
all
and
certainly
not
what
i
was
opening
for
when
i
opened
the
beer
d
i
tried
it
but
was
not
a
fan
i
usually
enjoy
sam
adams
offerings
but
not
this
one
a
little
too
sticky
to
make
you
want
another
d
easy
to
drink
got
double
gifted
the
winter
classic
24
pack
so
i
have
plenty
to
go
around
taste
is
strong
cranberries
and
not
much
else
almost
has
a
milky
or
creamy
taste
to
it
too
the
taste
is
strong
throughout
though
the
biggest
fear
i
had
was
that
it
would
be
strong
cranberries
upfront
and
quickly
fade
or
that
the
cranberry
taste
would
come
up
too
late
but
neither
fear
was
realized
here
its
really
a
solid
taste
throughout
the
mouthfeel
again
has
the
milky
or
creamy
feel
but
the
intense
carbonation
of
this
brew
makes
an
interesting
but
not
necessarily
good
feeling
i
would
say
it
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
for
this
weird
feeling
from
all
the
carbonation
surprised
that
after
all
of
these
years
of
hating
this
beer
that
i
actually
did
not
mind
it
that
much
essentially
a
dressed
up
wheat
beer
with
some
ocean
spray
cranberry
juice
added
good
tart
finish
and
some
coarse
grain
bitterness
to
offset
the
sweet
and
tart
you
can
find
a
yeastiness
in
there
as
well
not
something
id
drink
everyday
but
not
too
bad
either
very
well
carbonated
almost
to
a
fault
lighter
bodied
overall
it
went
down
ok
you
could
never
have
34
at
a
sitting
but
i
could
have
another
just
ok
but
far
from
the
horrific
and
even
mediocre
reviews
this
usually
gets
people
need
to
revisit
this
one
i
sure
needed
to
d
not
bad
almost
like
a
softdrink
and
refreshing
in
that
sense
it
has
just
enough
redeeming
character
so
that
i
will
be
able
to
finish
the
other
three
in
the
fridge
or
my
wife
will
this
really
is
not
a
lambic
in
the
traditional
sense
which
affects
my
ratings
lower
but
only
very
slightly
with
a
different
name
i
may
go
c
value
b
d
sourness
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
clean
finish
makes
this
a
rather
drinkable
beer
overall
ill
drink
one
if
its
free
sam
adams
has
plenty
of
other
beers
that
i
would
choose
over
this
this
beer
has
a
great
appearence
and
smells
good
but
leaves
you
wanting
alot
more
the
sweetness
is
so
overpowering
i
cant
imagine
alot
of
situations
i
would
reach
for
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
low
carbonation
which
made
it
very
easy
to
consume
the
flavor
was
not
as
strong
as
i
had
expected
i
am
not
sure
this
is
a
true
lambic
the
hoff
d
you
know
this
isnt
as
awesome
as
i
remember
but
its
still
very
good
i
think
my
taste
might
be
a
little
dulled
from
the
winters
bourbon
cask
ale
i
had
before
but
i
dig
this
beer
and
i
wish
they
sold
the
cranberry
lambic
in
sixpacks
id
say
make
this
your
first
beer
of
the
night
or
maybe
have
it
after
a
dark
malty
beer
or
a
stout
so
you
can
pick
up
the
cranberry
notes
as
a
side
note
if
you
like
a
girl
who
isnt
into
beer
this
apparently
a
good
starter
beer
for
her
all
the
guys
who
tasted
this
beer
with
me
hated
it
but
the
chicks
dug
it
cloudy
bloody
colored
body
with
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
cranberry
cherry
sour
aroma
a
strong
cranberry
dark
fruit
sour
aftertaste
with
plenty
of
sugar
to
go
around
a
thick
heavy
bodied
brew
that
sloshes
around
the
palate
like
yogurt
not
a
good
lambic
but
a
mediocre
one
try
it
only
to
put
some
more
cash
in
kochs
pocket
if
that
is
your
goal
d
not
as
bad
as
most
people
make
this
out
to
be
but
not
very
pleasant
either
perhaps
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
who
like
fruity
things
love
the
fruity
flavor
fruit
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
a
great
holiday
brew
the
feel
in
mouth
is
very
pleasant
and
hangs
out
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
i
guess
thats
aftertaste
but
is
a
good
aftertaste
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
they
claim
this
is
a
holiday
beer
i
can
believe
that
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
final
thoughts
i
was
able
to
obtain
this
as
an
individual
bottle
rather
than
in
the
variety
pack
and
i
am
so
glad
i
dont
have
to
drink
3
more
this
was
a
big
disappointment
but
at
least
it
only
set
me
back
2
60
would
rather
have
had
more
odd
nation
winter
09
pours
a
cloudy
and
dark
orange
champagnecolored
head
smell
is
fruity
almost
peachlike
and
sort
of
putrid
taste
starts
off
a
bit
like
maraschino
cherry
and
finishes
absolutely
sour
the
aftertaste
is
rotten
and
unpleasant
in
the
end
im
left
feeling
like
i
drank
a
glass
of
spoiled
cherry
cider
drinkability
is
nonexistent
drinkability
i
didnt
think
it
was
as
bad
as
its
been
hyped
to
be
definitely
lots
of
cranberry
flavor
which
isnt
personally
my
favorite
flavor
but
it
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
it
would
definitely
satisfy
a
fruitbeer
craving
decent
one
was
enough
though
this
beer
is
my
first
review
and
my
first
taste
of
the
lambic
style
upon
pouring
i
noticed
an
aroma
which
reminded
me
of
cranberries
and
wine
yeast
this
brew
poured
a
light
reddish
color
with
a
decent
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
what
surprised
me
the
most
was
the
taste
very
light
mouthfeel
with
a
taste
resembling
a
homemade
fruity
wine
rather
than
a
beer
the
cranberry
was
very
pronounced
and
tart
while
the
yeast
flavors
seemed
almost
overpowering
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
the
light
easy
drinking
cranberry
flavors
make
this
beer
one
that
the
family
could
enjoy
while
home
for
the
holidays
although
it
tasted
more
to
me
as
a
dulled
down
homemade
wine
it
was
definitely
not
bad
at
all
i
know
it
has
to
be
done
specialty
seasonal
holiday
brews
and
i
typically
dont
like
them
but
this
one
is
not
too
bad
this
beer
has
some
tartness
lingering
in
the
background
to
it
but
its
overwhelmed
by
tastes
of
bubblegum
and
banana
from
the
yeast
cranberry
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
with
the
malt
but
i
really
cant
get
over
the
yeast
character
if
this
had
some
more
of
the
complexitysourness
of
a
true
lambic
it
would
do
much
better
in
my
book
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
in
college
i
thought
it
was
completely
undrinkable
but
im
enjoying
sipping
on
it
right
now
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
sweet
and
fruity
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
amber
with
a
whiteish
foam
smells
incredibly
sweet
almost
syrupy
but
in
this
case
it
is
a
pleasant
aroma
and
the
cherry
is
not
only
present
but
prevelant
the
taste
is
malty
and
the
cherry
comes
in
quite
nicely
but
it
is
not
overly
sweet
feels
quite
crisp
and
the
fruity
aftertaste
is
a
plus
this
is
a
quite
alright
brew
and
while
it
has
its
weaknessess
its
strengths
more
than
outweigh
it
this
is
not
bad
at
all
not
a
lambic
by
any
means
its
an
inoffensive
fruit
beer
many
times
better
then
the
leinenkugel
fruit
beer
abominations
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
d
this
is
a
really
strange
beer
its
certainly
not
a
lambic
or
anything
resembling
one
the
combination
of
spice
fruit
and
tartness
just
isnt
working
out
here
a
desert
beer
ok
with
xmas
cookies
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
by
itself
im
rating
this
based
on
a
lambic
style
instead
of
the
cranberry
wheat
it
is
it
does
not
have
the
sparkling
crisp
pour
of
a
lambic
and
the
fruit
smell
was
subtle
for
a
lmabic
the
taste
was
more
domianted
by
the
wheat
taste
than
the
fruit
not
typical
is
there
actually
a
difference
between
the
cranberry
wit
and
the
cranberry
lambic
wouldnt
mind
having
them
side
but
side
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
waste
the
money
on
either
maybe
just
to
test
it
out
my
wife
ended
up
drinking
the
bulk
of
this
beer
tonight
and
actually
said
they
actually
have
the
nerve
of
calling
this
a
lambic
worst
sa
beer
they
have
d
ok
d
the
flavor
is
just
too
dominated
by
one
overly
sweet
flavor
to
warrant
drinking
another
one
unless
youre
a
real
cranberry
loverand
i
only
know
a
few
no
one
really
wants
to
eat
more
than
a
little
cranberry
sauce
its
the
same
with
this
beer
i
wish
sa
would
take
some
of
the
feedback
on
this
site
into
account
and
tweak
this
beers
formula
it
could
be
respectable
with
some
improvements
to
the
flavor
balance
making
it
an
actual
lambic
instead
of
a
secondrate
fruit
beer
would
help
as
well
d
there
is
nothing
drinkable
about
this
beer
its
that
bad
i
wouldnt
even
keep
these
in
my
fridge
as
free
beer
for
anyone
who
stops
over
however
dont
let
this
beer
stop
you
from
picking
up
the
winter
classics
pack
it
has
a
lot
of
great
beers
in
it
however
this
is
not
one
of
them
d
i
just
dont
think
it
tastes
like
a
real
lambic
its
not
an
undrinkable
beer
just
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
guess
im
giving
away
the
other
bottle
avoid
it
is
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
tastes
it
tastes
more
like
juice
than
a
beer
i
cant
say
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
other
one
in
my
pack
so
ill
probably
give
it
to
someone
this
is
worth
a
try
i
guess
but
its
not
the
best
thing
by
boston
beer
company
cheers
d
too
sweet
and
not
lambiclike
at
all
really
its
a
bit
too
syrpuy
in
nature
not
bad
as
a
beer
and
a
decent
addition
to
the
holiday
pack
it
doesnt
live
up
to
its
name
it
is
also
too
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
later
on
through
the
beer
it
got
really
buttery
which
just
killed
the
flavor
for
me
too
anyway
id
avoid
this
had
a
small
head
that
disappeared
almost
immediately
it
had
a
nice
color
to
it
imo
a
hazy
orange
brownish
all
i
got
in
the
smell
was
cranberry
and
caramel
maybe
some
brown
sugar
too
the
taste
was
similar
to
cranberry
juice
just
not
nearly
as
tangy
i
didnt
get
any
caramel
malt
in
the
taste
like
i
did
when
i
smelled
it
its
a
little
sour
kind
of
when
it
goes
down
and
leaves
a
less
than
par
after
taste
this
beer
was
decent
nothing
special
but
i
dont
think
its
as
bad
as
a
lot
of
people
do
d
im
normally
a
big
sa
fan
but
this
brew
was
not
very
tasty
ive
never
been
much
on
lambics
and
this
one
did
nothing
to
change
my
perception
its
a
good
beer
to
have
occasionally
but
a
bit
too
much
for
me
and
im
not
sure
what
the
much
is
this
is
no
masterpiece
but
its
no
travesty
either
d
this
beer
feels
like
something
thrown
in
with
an
otherwise
superior
winter
pack
no
craft
could
have
gone
into
formulating
this
beer
d
this
beer
is
far
more
drinkable
than
in
the
past
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
a
nice
fall
meal
but
on
its
own
i
think
one
is
enough
it
seems
that
bbc
took
at
least
some
of
the
criticism
of
this
beer
to
heart
and
made
it
less
soda
like
and
more
lambic
like
its
a
welcome
change
and
having
had
some
of
the
new
limited
edition
beers
from
sam
adams
it
seems
as
though
this
is
a
new
trend
that
i
hope
continues
d
drinkable
enough
but
severely
lacking
in
flavor
just
overly
mild
and
seemingly
watered
down
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
again
d
no
thanks
i
would
be
afraid
to
give
it
to
a
friend
or
someone
else
they
might
actually
think
i
like
this
stuff
the
taste
was
sour
but
not
mouth
puckeringly
so
there
was
also
a
malt
sweetness
the
maple
flavor
mentioned
on
the
label
the
color
was
a
redorange
and
it
had
a
one
finger
high
beige
head
that
faded
pretty
quickly
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
a
little
oily
and
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
but
its
a
different
taste
so
12
oz
was
good
24
oz
might
be
pushing
it
atmosphere
is
okay
appearance
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
nose
is
really
sweet
and
not
very
beery
for
what
its
worth
taste
again
is
sweet
but
tastes
almost
like
its
bad
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
but
not
something
youd
want
to
partake
of
in
great
quantities
or
very
often
d
i
feel
like
i
have
a
sugar
buzz
after
one
of
these
not
sure
if
i
would
press
my
luck
with
two
its
kind
of
like
drinking
a
beer
that
the
flintstone
vitamin
company
made
thickness
and
carbonation
is
fine
and
i
could
stand
to
drink
more
than
one
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
this
seems
alot
different
than
the
tart
cranberry
beer
i
remember
drinking
a
few
years
ago
overall
i
didnt
hold
this
beer
to
be
the
most
enjoyable
but
as
with
most
i
appreciated
its
unique
qualities
despite
the
afore
mentioned
lack
of
enjoyment
all
in
all
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
weather
as
part
of
a
multi
pack
but
certainly
not
something
id
buy
on
its
own
i
picked
this
one
up
in
a
winter
beer
sampler
pack
and
im
glad
there
were
only
two
of
this
one
in
the
set
having
never
tried
a
lambic
before
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
but
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
sam
adams
this
time
several
reviews
said
that
this
beer
does
not
fit
the
style
of
a
lambic
if
this
statement
is
true
i
look
forward
to
sampling
some
lambics
in
the
future
that
are
closer
to
the
style
i
would
advice
staying
away
from
this
one
though
overall
sweet
and
tart
if
you
like
cranberries
this
is
for
you
cranberry
lambic
was
not
the
dreaded
experience
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
from
all
ive
read
about
it
as
it
warms
it
actually
is
pleasing
to
feel
and
taste
in
the
mouth
im
afraid
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
many
of
these
in
a
row
however
having
one
every
now
and
again
around
the
holidays
would
not
be
amiss
needless
to
say
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
a
little
on
the
high
end
at
5
9
but
id
never
be
having
more
than
two
anyway
based
on
the
packaging
i
did
find
this
beer
ended
up
in
my
stomach
rather
quickly
im
pretty
okay
with
fruit
beers
they
sure
beat
the
hell
out
of
fruit
juice
this
one
in
particular
even
beats
the
cranberry
wit
for
me
that
was
too
much
of
a
coriander
bomb
if
i
end
up
liking
the
rest
of
the
winter
mixed
pack
this
is
something
id
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
more
times
this
year
and
the
suggestion
of
having
it
with
turkey
actually
sounds
really
nice
i
also
have
a
feeling
this
blends
well
with
the
coastal
wheat
in
the
package
for
those
who
may
not
enjoy
a
full
glass
of
this
d
the
cranberry
aftertaste
is
so
overpowering
that
i
couldnt
give
this
part
a
good
rating
overall
not
exactly
seasonal
nor
lambic
this
one
doesnt
fit
the
bill
in
my
winter
variety
but
itll
do
if
im
looking
for
a
light
beer
taste
alas
this
keeps
being
put
into
the
winter
sampler
year
after
year
and
this
time
add
the
2
bottles
of
the
next
to
awful
coastal
wheat
and
you
have
a
no
sale
which
is
a
bloody
shame
a
twelve
pack
consisting
of
winter
holiday
porter
and
old
fezziwig
would
be
just
the
ticket
drinkability
is
fine
i
suppose
not
a
horrible
beer
but
not
at
all
what
the
label
claims
and
even
when
you
recognize
what
it
is
its
not
much
better
than
average
d
no
bitterness
at
all
but
thats
just
as
bad
as
having
no
sweetness
imo
too
much
of
one
thing
after
developing
my
palate
in
the
year
since
i
first
had
one
of
these
i
realized
how
far
ive
come
and
how
little
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
else
overall
this
is
not
the
lambic
for
me
the
fruit
isnt
fresh
or
tart
and
it
is
very
dry
in
general
the
maple
syrup
in
a
weird
addition
to
it
not
something
i
want
a
lot
of
d
meh
i
cant
say
i
would
seek
it
out
again
though
it
wasnt
hard
to
put
this
one
down
paired
well
with
turkey
caserole
drinkability
im
enjoying
this
even
if
it
is
redolent
of
both
banana
and
pissoir
so
yeah
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
past
this
but
in
the
moment
its
fine
i
recommend
drinking
this
with
something
highish
abv
under
your
belt
for
starters
you
may
enjoy
it
more
had
this
beer
out
of
the
sam
adams
winter
classics
pack
obviously
the
reviews
thus
far
have
not
been
kind
but
ill
try
to
keep
an
open
mind
color
is
dull
reddish
with
a
two
and
a
half
finger
head
that
dissipates
down
to
a
small
ring
smells
predominantly
of
cranberry
and
some
malt
reasonably
promising
the
taste
is
surprisingly
strong
with
a
really
upfront
cranberry
sweetness
and
the
caramel
flavors
promised
on
the
bottle
its
not
quite
as
bad
as
some
people
said
it
was
but
on
the
whole
i
thought
it
was
really
unbalanced
and
the
cranberry
sweetness
resembled
a
cranberry
juice
or
soda
more
than
it
should
have
marginally
decent
but
a
big
letdown
for
me
based
on
sam
adams
previous
track
record
drinkability
one
and
im
done
a
bit
too
sweet
definitely
not
a
lambic
but
not
horrible
would
not
get
in
a
six
pack
if
they
ever
offered
it
d
from
what
i
see
alot
of
people
bash
and
dislike
this
beer
but
i
would
disagree
granted
its
not
superb
but
not
terrible
either
d
very
easy
to
drink
the
taste
while
not
terrible
isnt
something
i
would
search
out
i
really
dont
mind
the
pair
of
these
that
come
with
the
sa
holiday
pack
though
this
was
an
overall
disappointing
beer
that
had
strange
tastes
that
seemed
out
of
place
perhaps
its
my
palate
but
its
tastes
didnt
orchestrate
like
sam
adams
normally
does
for
me
overall
a
very
strange
unpleasurable
beer
it
is
however
substantially
drinkable
low
levels
of
carbonation
di
couldnt
even
finish
the
one
i
reviewed
the
berry
flavor
was
just
too
strong
and
not
enough
other
flavors
to
really
keep
me
sticking
around
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
ive
had
much
better
variations
of
the
same
style
i
could
see
myself
drinking
one
of
these
after
a
hearty
ale
and
with
a
dessert
at
thanksgiving
but
not
really
going
to
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
i
know
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
hate
but
i
actually
didnt
find
it
to
be
too
bad
if
you
try
to
imagine
it
as
a
lambic
and
not
something
else
it
actually
makes
more
sense
than
it
used
to
to
me
to
me
it
falls
squarely
in
line
with
sam
adams
usual
mo
nothing
amazing
but
decent
beers
that
would
represent
the
style
well
to
newcomers
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
it
has
a
medium
reddish
brown
color
that
is
slightly
cloudy
the
head
is
fairly
white
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
the
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
has
a
somewhat
unpleasant
sweet
and
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
cherry
and
cranberry
the
taste
is
very
sweet
as
expected
it
has
an
overall
fruity
taste
it
is
hard
to
really
pin
point
an
exact
type
of
fruit
the
sweetness
is
coming
from
the
end
of
the
sip
leaves
a
tartness
on
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
not
too
enjoyable
i
am
definitely
more
excited
about
the
other
selections
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
unless
one
is
handed
to
me
at
a
party
or
something
i
definitely
wont
be
seeking
it
out
anytime
soon
i
really
wish
the
cranberry
flavor
was
more
subtle
i
think
it
could
have
been
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
decent
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
the
worst
part
the
aftertaste
is
horrid
which
isnt
a
problem
though
until
you
get
near
the
end
of
the
glass
this
is
also
not
a
lambic
its
a
cranberry
wheat
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
but
with
cranberry
flavor
instead
and
not
quite
as
sweet
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
suspect
it
wouldnt
get
blasted
in
the
ratings
as
much
if
they
labeled
it
what
it
was
a
flavored
wheat
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
real
lambic
when
i
saw
the
bottle
but
after
seeing
the
catagory
it
being
a
fruitvegetable
beer
ill
take
it
for
what
its
worth
hope
to
try
a
real
lambic
soon
drinkabilty
is
just
ok
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
it
just
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
its
not
terrible
but
not
something
id
look
forward
to
having
again
salud
drinkability
it
is
too
bad
they
put
so
much
maple
syrup
in
to
counter
the
tartness
and
spiciness
it
could
have
been
pretty
good
as
is
it
is
okay
certainly
not
the
disaster
many
make
it
out
to
be
but
id
rather
not
have
more
drinkability
is
not
so
good
the
only
good
thing
is
that
only
2
bottles
of
this
came
in
the
sa
winter
mix
bbc
needs
to
retire
this
offering
not
very
pleasant
at
all
pours
like
a
beer
when
really
it
shouldnt
no
real
lambic
qualites
to
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rose
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
of
cranberries
taste
is
tart
cranberries
but
not
to
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
cheers
it
smells
strongly
of
cranberries
and
sorta
taste
like
them
i
guess
verdict
sam
adams
cranberry
lambic
may
not
be
a
real
lambic
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
just
think
of
it
as
a
wheat
beer
with
a
fruit
twist
its
interesting
enough
and
really
works
well
as
part
of
the
winter
mixed
pack
even
looking
at
this
as
just
a
fruit
beer
this
is
just
too
soft
and
forgettable
pretty
poor
effort
from
sam
adams
that
i
wish
they
would
replace
with
something
else
in
their
winter
beer
pack
i
think
this
beer
suffers
from
the
typical
antifruit
sentiment
that
plagues
the
style
in
actuality
ive
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
the
color
is
a
nice
reddish
hue
with
offwhite
head
the
flavor
isnt
too
tart
while
maintaining
a
distinct
cranberry
flavor
tehre
is
also
a
certain
butterylike
aspect
to
the
flavor
which
is
a
bit
odd
at
first
mouth
is
light
and
it
has
a
good
drinkability
the
mistake
i
think
they
are
making
is
releasing
it
with
the
winter
pack
i
tried
it
in
winter
and
then
have
now
had
it
in
summer
it
was
the
noly
decent
thing
available
at
a
bbq
and
it
was
quite
enjoyable
in
the
heat
certainly
nothing
amazing
but
not
too
bad
d
reading
the
label
it
says
wheat
beer
brewed
with
cranberry
juice
and
other
natural
flavors
added
this
is
not
a
lambic
one
taste
is
really
enough
i
think
ill
stick
to
my
lindemans
of
course
i
was
suckered
into
this
by
the
winter
mix
pack
which
is
otherwise
excellent
color
is
like
a
slightly
cloudy
rose
wine
and
the
head
dissipates
to
almost
nothing
smells
like
cranberrycherry
koolaidsugary
the
cranberry
flavor
is
there
but
not
tart
and
pronounced
perhaps
like
candy
or
if
you
mixed
a
wheat
beer
with
koolaid
eventually
it
tastes
like
a
cherry
lollipop
wait
did
someone
drop
a
jolly
rancher
in
my
beer
90s
style
at
least
i
got
a
little
clove
and
banana
from
the
wheat
but
its
certainly
not
enough
how
does
this
continue
to
be
made
at
least
call
it
something
besides
lambic
because
it
aint
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
sweetness
is
challenging
besides
just
not
being
very
good
overall
cant
imagine
having
anotherthis
one
is
more
than
enough
bottom
line
sam
adams
should
not
be
making
this
they
know
better
but
more
importantly
they
shouldnt
be
calling
it
a
lambic
because
its
not
a
true
lambic
or
if
it
is
it
certainly
tastes
fake
people
interested
in
trying
new
beers
may
think
they
dislike
lambics
if
this
touches
their
tongues
first
as
i
get
closer
to
finishing
this
beer
i
noticed
the
clumps
of
yeast
hanging
out
at
the
bottom
i
am
uneasy
they
are
big
enough
to
launch
an
assult
and
carry
this
glass
away
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
orange
in
color
with
above
average
amounts
and
very
active
prickle
light
foam
head
fruity
nose
with
hints
of
grape
and
cranberry
unfortunately
i
would
say
that
the
nose
would
be
rated
higher
if
not
for
what
you
know
is
coming
after
you
sip
the
beer
smooth
attack
and
smooth
fruity
flavor
the
cranberry
presents
itself
towards
the
end
of
the
flavorsip
and
the
beer
manages
to
finish
dry
and
almost
clean
its
just
on
a
lower
level
than
most
sam
adams
and
also
other
fruitvegetable
beers
i
am
glad
they
make
it
as
its
different
but
just
not
great
i
have
tried
this
beer
on
numerous
occassions
and
i
think
that
the
best
reviewing
statement
that
i
can
make
is
that
when
i
get
them
in
the
sam
adams
mixed
packs
i
dont
drink
them
until
later
in
an
afternoonevening
after
i
have
had
a
couple
of
beers
to
soften
the
blow
notes
i
actually
dont
mind
this
beer
but
i
have
to
be
in
an
odd
mood
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
also
the
bottle
reads
that
they
use
a
top
fermenting
yeast
so
this
is
in
no
way
anything
close
to
a
real
lambic
beer
very
smooth
drinker
d
drank
half
of
it
then
a
drainpour
i
dont
know
if
a
cranberry
beer
is
just
a
bad
idea
or
if
sa
made
a
bad
cranberry
beer
either
way
i
dont
like
it
d
i
guess
in
the
stead
of
real
rotting
cranberries
to
go
with
your
turkey
this
could
step
in
and
be
drinkable
but
that
is
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
please
sam
adams
dont
ever
put
this
stuff
in
a
12
pack
again
sad
thing
is
they
make
so
many
good
beers
this
was
really
hard
to
drink
i
couldnt
even
get
through
one
bottle
this
is
terrible
i
will
never
drink
this
again
unless
i
was
cast
away
like
in
that
movie
with
tom
hanks
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
watery
and
disappointing
the
drinkability
is
the
same
not
impressed
put
something
else
on
rotation
please
dnot
a
lambic
not
bad
but
a
little
disappointing
might
have
been
much
better
if
they
hadnt
skimped
on
the
fruit
d
cant
finish
this
not
drinkable
i
have
to
wonder
what
they
are
thinking
when
they
makebottle
this
i
dont
think
this
fits
as
a
true
lambic
it
is
just
a
weird
fruit
beer
not
recommended
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
people
make
it
out
to
be
but
its
certainly
not
the
best
either
i
havent
ever
had
a
true
lambic
so
i
was
just
reviewing
as
a
beer
not
against
the
lambic
style
overall
interesting
my
first
cranberry
lambic
not
great
but
drinkable
dont
know
if
i
would
go
back
immediately
for
another
after
finishing
this
one
got
this
in
a
sampler
pack
since
i
like
their
cherry
wheat
so
much
i
was
optimistic
but
i
think
they
ended
up
brewing
cranberry
juice
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
sharp
and
bitter
but
fruity
and
the
cranberry
was
evident
in
the
smell
and
immediately
with
the
taste
that
was
the
single
overwhelming
aspect
of
it
the
cranberry
it
was
fairly
dry
and
tart
but
the
fruit
was
too
overpowering
to
really
enjoy
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
orange
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
sour
malt
and
hint
of
cranberries
the
taste
has
a
mild
lambic
bite
and
a
bit
of
cranberry
tang
the
feel
is
light
and
very
dry
this
is
not
a
great
lambic
it
doesnt
really
give
you
that
good
lambic
bite
that
id
want
in
one
but
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
cranberry
lambic
is
probably
the
least
enjoyable
beer
ive
ever
had
from
bbc
im
pleased
to
see
that
its
perhaps
in
the
appropriate
style
classification
here
this
is
not
even
close
to
being
a
lambic
im
not
sure
theres
any
modifications
that
could
be
made
to
this
to
classify
it
as
such
its
not
a
good
beer
im
not
even
sure
its
worth
a
try
probably
better
to
skip
this
one
all
around
drinkability
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
if
it
were
sold
alone
cranberry
lambic
comes
as
part
of
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
a
very
good
beer
either
pours
a
clear
reddish
orange
with
2
fingers
of
foamy
tanwhite
head
with
some
pink
highlights
ok
retention
and
some
ok
lacing
blotches
smells
of
clove
honey
funk
and
cranberries
tastes
of
honey
lemon
sugar
clove
cranberry
and
some
wheat
notes
that
are
slightly
off
medium
in
body
not
much
carbonation
a
little
watery
with
not
much
tartness
and
a
little
too
much
candy
not
a
lambic
i
would
really
want
to
purchase
again
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
murky
garnet
color
with
a
slightly
pinktinted
onefinger
head
the
retention
was
moderate
and
the
lacing
scattered
the
aroma
was
of
pale
malt
cranberry
juice
wheat
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
started
semisweet
with
lots
of
cranberry
juice
then
gave
way
to
wheat
and
pale
malt
the
aftertaste
was
bitter
but
not
in
a
hoppy
way
it
was
more
of
a
weird
things
that
should
not
be
in
beer
kind
of
way
quite
tart
and
acidic
one
was
all
you
would
want
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
low
not
really
a
lambic
and
not
recommended
a
little
too
sweet
the
taste
is
too
much
on
the
candy
side
it
gives
up
the
taste
and
feel
of
beer
and
is
more
like
a
wine
or
cranberry
drink
the
smell
is
a
little
too
much
on
the
candy
side
it
is
very
drinkable
and
very
light
in
taste
the
taste
however
isnt
all
it
could
be
d
not
my
style
very
fruity
not
a
whole
lot
else
i
love
everything
sam
adams
well
almost
everything
now
not
a
winner
for
me
medium
body
with
fairly
low
carbonation
im
kinda
glad
i
read
so
many
negative
reviews
before
trying
this
for
myself
because
my
expectations
were
so
low
i
couldnt
possibly
be
underwhelmed
this
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
dare
i
say
it
was
actually
kind
of
well
good
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
name
because
this
is
not
a
lambic
at
all
its
just
a
better
version
of
the
cherry
wheat
and
with
cranberries
instead
of
cherries
they
should
call
it
what
it
is
cranberry
wheat
call
me
crazy
but
i
rather
like
that
sour
fruit
flavor
and
found
it
very
refreshing
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
buy
this
at
any
time
but
i
do
think
its
a
step
up
from
the
cherry
wheat
and
fits
in
nicely
as
a
winter
seasonal
d
a
nice
overall
raspberry
brew
here
better
than
most
raspberry
inspired
belgian
interpretations
from
other
american
craft
brewers
but
not
a
true
lambic
good
for
the
right
occassion
but
not
really
worthy
of
a
six
pack
purchase
pours
a
very
pale
golden
colored
body
with
a
foamy
white
head
with
good
lacing
has
a
very
cranberry
sour
aroma
almost
like
sour
cherries
mild
sweet
cranberry
taste
not
malty
or
hoppy
but
bready
not
very
fizzy
i
dont
know
about
this
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
off
i
wish
they
would
not
use
the
word
lambic
in
the
title
because
it
certainly
is
not
a
lambic
in
general
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sam
adams
beer
but
not
this
particular
one
overall
lack
of
flavor
and
some
other
issues
makes
this
one
is
a
pass
feel
and
drinkability
low
carbonation
and
just
a
thick
sickly
feel
to
it
terrible
its
that
damn
maple
syrup
this
shit
sucks
i
swear
to
god
if
i
ever
meet
a
person
that
swears
by
this
beer
im
going
to
punch
them
right
in
the
face
i
think
that
id
prolly
drink
that
fucked
up
petrus
aged
pale
than
this
at
least
with
that
there
might
some
hint
of
what
the
beer
was
supposed
to
be
this
shit
has
no
clue
id
like
to
meet
the
idiot
that
thought
that
this
beer
would
be
a
good
idea
do
you
not
see
what
you
have
done
youve
made
every
stupid
ass
college
kid
that
is
a
sam
adams
religious
zealot
think
that
this
is
the
way
a
lambic
is
supposed
to
taste
now
do
you
think
that
that
kid
is
going
to
go
out
and
ever
try
a
real
lambic
kids
on
the
short
bus
wouldnt
even
drink
this
beer
they
know
better
infact
im
going
to
get
a
whole
army
of
them
and
come
and
find
and
destroy
the
fool
who
came
up
with
the
idea
of
adding
maple
syrup
to
a
belgian
style
that
is
supposed
to
be
sour
and
tart
retard
strength
will
win
out
the
day
this
is
serously
an
abomination
of
all
that
is
good
an
holy
in
beer
i
think
that
with
each
barrel
of
this
shit
that
is
brewed
at
least
one
monk
is
rolling
over
in
his
grave
maybe
even
damning
god
for
the
birth
of
the
fool
who
came
up
with
this
idea
stay
away
from
this
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
this
if
i
did
i
wouldve
regretted
it
and
would
have
much
rather
set
the
money
afire
or
worse
given
it
to
a
homeless
if
you
drink
this
beer
itll
steal
520mins
of
youre
life
that
youll
never
get
back
stay
away
its
not
even
worth
it
as
a
novelty
brew
this
is
the
second
cranberry
lambic
from
a
sa
holiday
pack
i
bought
in
november
and
i
dont
remember
the
first
being
nearly
this
strange
then
again
i
had
a
head
cold
when
i
drank
the
first
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
cherry
hues
foamy
white
head
that
did
not
disappear
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
weak
fruits
with
a
metalic
quality
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
again
with
the
metalic
thingsome
hints
of
cranberry
and
wheat
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
d
drain
pour
and
poured
quick
too
have
i
mentioned
how
i
loathe
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
character
limit
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
the
drink
is
okay
i
could
almost
enjoy
2
of
these
on
a
warm
day
its
a
little
refreshing
lots
of
cranberrys
on
the
smell
taste
i
didnt
really
enjoy
the
sourness
of
the
cranberrys
mixed
with
the
malt
just
didnt
work
for
me
maybe
cranberrys
shouldnt
be
in
beer
something
different
for
sure
but
not
all
that
pleasant
and
certainly
shouldnt
really
be
in
a
winter
holiday
pack
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
expecting
cranbeery
cough
syrup
like
their
cherry
wheat
but
it
was
not
like
that
although
it
wasnt
an
automatic
drain
pour
it
quickly
got
old
and
i
could
finish
it
thanks
for
giving
me
a
pop
at
this
shawn
overall
this
beer
deserves
all
the
digs
taken
at
it
id
say
avoid
it
but
sa
has
made
that
impossible
d
i
would
give
0
for
this
is
i
could
d
limited
not
the
vile
beer
i
was
expecting
though
ill
take
this
over
cherry
wheat
any
day
so
im
supposed
to
rate
this
relative
to
its
style
but
what
style
is
this
exactly
this
is
unlike
any
lambic
ive
had
thats
for
sure
pours
a
light
ruby
red
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
fast
to
a
spotty
film
medium
carbonation
and
moderate
lacing
smells
strongly
of
cranberry
and
fruit
taste
reminds
me
of
those
beers
i
had
in
germany
once
where
they
mixed
a
pilsner
type
beer
with
cola
tequila
or
lime
except
this
is
like
they
took
some
kind
of
light
wheat
beer
and
dumped
cranberry
juice
into
it
it
literally
tastes
like
a
mixed
drink
of
wheat
lager
and
cranberry
juice
not
a
good
combination
in
my
humble
opinion
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
a
little
sweet
very
sour
probably
would
have
been
a
drain
pour
if
i
did
not
have
such
respect
for
jim
koch
and
the
boston
beer
companys
other
products
as
i
would
have
felt
bad
about
it
im
sorry
but
is
one
of
the
worst
beer
drinking
experiences
i
have
had
in
awhile
not
recommended
overall
some
pleasant
aspects
but
misses
the
mark
the
smell
reminded
me
of
rotten
fruit
which
drags
its
drinkability
way
down
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
finish
it
and
i
did
it
just
to
say
i
did
but
i
will
never
pour
myself
another
one
of
these
abominations
again
i
was
willing
to
give
this
beer
one
more
try
since
im
always
trying
to
be
open
to
a
new
good
beer
i
have
poured
this
out
in
the
past
since
the
tast
of
cran
is
strong
i
was
not
totally
turned
off
by
this
beer
and
did
end
up
enjoying
it
i
would
suggest
pairing
it
will
a
good
turkey
or
chicken
meal
with
some
fixings
do
seems
to
be
its
most
drinkable
at
its
coldest
you
know
for
a
holiday
gettogether
this
seems
like
an
inoffensive
offering
and
one
thats
certainly
different
from
most
of
the
stuff
on
the
market
however
if
your
main
draw
is
for
a
winter
warmer
and
not
a
fruit
beer
keep
looking
there
are
better
offerings
than
this
even
within
the
holiday
sampler
you
can
only
get
these
from
the
holiday
porter
was
very
tasty
if
someone
told
me
this
was
mikes
hard
cranberry
a
drink
which
i
havent
tried
i
would
probably
believe
them
i
wouldnt
pour
this
thing
down
the
drain
but
its
also
not
my
first
or
second
pick
out
of
the
winter
sampler
either
drinkability
ehhh
d
very
seasonal
but
there
are
much
better
coices
out
there
does
not
taste
like
a
lambic
but
more
like
a
sour
fruit
ale
would
not
drink
another
overall
i
dont
get
why
sam
adams
puts
this
lousy
product
in
with
an
otherwise
good
selection
of
beersales
a
lot
of
people
say
that
this
doesnt
taste
like
beer
i
have
to
disagree
there
it
tastes
more
like
beer
than
some
ive
had
just
not
a
very
good
beer
thin
all
the
way
through
like
someone
took
cranberry
juice
and
just
added
2
parts
water
to
it
with
an
unenjoyable
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
puckering
sourness
at
the
end
that
just
stays
with
you
that
flavor
lingers
on
the
palate
which
isnt
a
real
enjoyable
experience
has
kind
of
a
musty
foulness
about
it
somehow
manages
to
be
real
chewy
and
cloying
despite
the
thin
taste
behind
it
if
you
can
get
past
the
taste
its
very
drinkable
and
highly
carbonated
overall
its
not
the
posterchild
for
terribleness
that
it
is
made
out
to
be
and
i
can
see
someone
who
enjoys
the
lighter
fare
enjoying
this
as
well
but
im
really
not
a
fan
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
pillowy
white
head
lacing
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
fruity
with
lots
of
apple
notes
and
a
ever
so
slight
cranberry
nose
there
too
ethanol
towards
the
back
which
really
sours
the
smell
really
an
odd
smell
to
this
beer
taste
is
not
good
many
layers
of
flavors
but
unfortunately
none
of
them
good
first
is
an
apple
pear
taste
that
turns
into
a
bit
tart
into
cranberry
and
then
a
real
cloying
finish
i
might
have
to
turn
the
remaining
bottles
into
a
sauce
or
marinade
as
i
will
have
some
trouble
finishing
this
one
off
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
chewey
and
could
benefit
from
a
tad
bit
more
carbonation
to
help
carry
away
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
ok
nobody
likes
this
beer
but
hear
me
out
it
is
fine
if
its
not
too
cold
poured
in
the
proper
lambic
glass
the
pour
comes
out
a
bubbly
leatherbrownorange
with
a
1
finger
head
that
stays
retains
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
tart
berry
spice
with
orange
while
the
flavor
is
a
tart
crangrape
with
lemon
hops
the
malt
is
nice
and
the
flavor
not
overwhelming
although
ive
had
worse
examples
usually
too
cold
straight
from
the
bottle
at
cookouts
not
stellar
but
done
right
it
is
decent
drinkability
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
lambic
to
me
this
was
way
to
sweet
fruit
is
prevalent
so
it
fits
the
style
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
i
finished
it
and
drank
the
other
bottle
too
but
more
out
of
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
fair
play
ill
get
the
multipack
again
but
probably
just
hold
the
lambic
for
my
fruitybeer
drinking
friend
after
drinking
this
beer
i
am
forced
to
wonder
who
is
drinking
enough
of
this
to
keep
up
the
demand
i
very
rarely
almost
never
pour
out
a
beer
before
i
am
done
with
it
but
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
those
beers
appearance
is
good
making
me
think
at
first
that
it
may
be
ok
but
the
smell
is
sour
and
the
taste
is
tart
and
too
sweet
like
coughsyrup
mixed
with
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
puckering
and
drinkability
is
not
there
for
me
i
know
that
someone
likes
this
beer
but
i
am
not
that
person
do
this
beer
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
its
made
out
to
be
but
its
certainly
no
lambic
its
a
fruit
beer
and
a
very
sweet
one
at
that
the
fact
that
it
continues
in
production
means
that
someone
is
drinking
it
and
my
guess
is
this
is
targeted
towards
those
who
would
be
put
off
by
a
true
fruit
lambic
a
fancy
beer
for
the
lesseducated
palates
thats
included
in
a
festive
holiday
sampler
pack
i
understand
what
bbc
was
trying
to
do
and
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
but
i
probably
wont
have
another
unless
i
shared
a
bottle
over
dessert
with
several
other
people
i
was
trying
to
migrate
to
craft
beer
the
nose
alone
was
tough
to
get
past
d
not
a
bad
drink
albeit
the
sourness
is
a
lil
over
the
top
and
hinders
me
from
wanting
another
one
right
now
not
bad
but
could
be
better
drinkability
if
you
been
clamoring
for
a
cranberry
beer
this
may
be
your
lucky
day
i
myself
would
pass
on
another
of
these
tastehmmm
cranberryapple
light
carbonation
really
make
this
seem
to
be
a
glass
of
juice
wheres
the
tart
mouth
puckering
lambic
finish
overly
sweet
and
not
very
complex
its
not
terrible
if
youv
never
had
a
true
lambic
try
this
one
then
drink
a
duchesse
de
bourgogne
or
rocdenbach
grand
cru
yet
another
example
of
belgian
vs
belgianstyle
i
dont
know
what
i
was
really
expecting
out
of
this
but
i
know
i
was
expecting
better
d
this
beer
is
ok
and
can
be
consumed
in
numbers
but
this
is
in
no
way
a
lambic
i
was
glad
to
see
that
the
site
labeled
this
as
a
fruit
beer
because
that
is
all
that
is
here
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
the
bad
naming
takes
away
from
this
beer
ah
well
its
ok
very
drinkable
but
seems
to
be
very
light
bodied
and
uninspired
for
a
lambic
the
complex
flavors
of
a
true
lambic
didnt
seem
to
hit
it
off
with
this
offering
notes
a
good
fruit
beer
but
not
a
lambic
at
all
how
they
get
away
with
using
lambic
on
the
label
is
beyond
me
its
not
even
close
the
new
longshot
cranberry
wit
should
take
the
place
of
this
beer
imo
overall
intentionally
left
blank
poured
this
from
a
bottle
i
got
in
a
holiday
pack
not
much
head
on
this
beer
poured
bright
red
and
looked
almost
like
some
coloring
was
added
to
a
golden
ale
smell
was
faint
spicy
malts
with
mostly
cranberry
notes
taste
is
sour
with
lots
of
cranberry
the
cranberry
doesnt
match
well
with
the
subtle
hoppiness
and
malt
notes
in
the
beer
if
it
was
balanced
better
it
may
taste
good
but
it
just
doesnt
grow
on
you
and
if
anything
i
struggled
to
enjoy
it
half
way
through
the
beer
my
least
favorite
in
this
pack
which
is
alot
to
say
considering
one
of
my
least
favorite
sam
adams
beers
is
the
boston
lager
which
is
also
in
the
pack
and
unfortunately
nearly
all
of
their
packs
medium
in
body
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
okay
as
part
of
a
variety
pack
ps
dont
let
it
warm
up
drinkability
on
this
is
kind
of
low
because
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
wanted
it
i
did
down
this
sucker
as
fast
as
possible
to
get
another
beer
without
pouring
it
does
that
make
it
drinkable
i
just
dont
understand
this
beer
how
do
they
get
off
calling
this
a
lambic
its
the
farthest
thing
from
it
and
is
almost
a
mockery
of
the
belgians
if
i
reviewed
this
as
a
lambic
it
would
get
an
f
but
for
what
it
actually
is
cranberry
wheat
its
really
not
that
bad
as
a
fruit
beer
i
gave
this
a
shot
because
it
came
in
a
bbc
winter
brew
pack
and
i
like
or
can
drink
most
of
the
accompanying
brews
i
tried
it
quite
some
time
ago
and
swore
it
off
but
my
tastes
have
changed
and
i
wanted
to
give
it
another
try
i
guess
i
havent
changed
that
much
mouthfeel
is
bitter
sweet
yeast
seems
too
aggressive
for
the
beer
interesting
none
the
less
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
alone
drinkability
while
this
goes
down
easy
i
will
probably
only
drink
it
again
to
finish
off
my
supply
from
the
holiday
sampler
i
got
this
as
part
of
the
holiday
pack
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddish
orange
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
bit
leaving
rings
of
white
lace
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
a
sweet
and
sour
thing
going
on
it
is
a
bit
like
a
fruity
vinegar
no
notes
of
cranberrries
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
vingary
finish
the
after
taste
is
a
bit
sour
but
no
hints
of
cranberries
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
imo
a
bit
of
a
sipper
because
of
the
funky
flavors
this
is
not
as
terrible
as
everyone
makes
it
out
to
be
being
said
it
is
not
a
lambic
either
2
of
these
a
year
in
the
holiday
pack
are
more
than
enough
got
a
winter
sampler
as
a
gift
this
is
my
least
favorite
in
the
box
i
have
had
great
lambics
and
this
is
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
a
lambic
in
my
opinion
is
the
label
it
is
very
thin
and
watered
down
tasting
malt
comes
through
but
sweetness
seems
forced
or
artificial
i
appreciate
their
effort
but
wouldnt
want
another
if
this
was
a
classified
as
a
cranberry
wheat
or
fruit
beer
it
would
be
pretty
good
but
going
by
the
style
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
misses
the
mark
rated
nov

2008
very
new
to
lambics
but
found
this
obviously
in
a
friends
fridge
and
decided
to
rate
it
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
the
apperance
i
feel
as
though
it
holds
its
head
well
throughout
the
poor
and
has
a
nice
unfiltered
color
i
associate
with
belguims
in
general
yet
the
smell
seems
a
bit
strong
on
the
cranberries
almost
opening
a
cranberry
sauce
can
once
again
i
know
very
little
about
lambics
but
the
cranberrys
seem
to
be
too
strong
and
borderline
predominant
all
i
can
seem
to
catch
is
sweet
and
bitter
both
from
the
cranberries
also
the
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
special
seems
to
border
between
a
bubbly
lager
and
a
smooth
ale
nothing
that
is
overly
definable
of
its
self
the
drinkablity
is
a
bit
low
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
as
well
as
the
strong
cranberry
character
make
it
to
be
a
one
beer
a
night
type
of
deal
any
more
of
this
would
be
a
bit
more
than
my
palate
could
handle
other
comments
maybe
its
the
slightly
cloying
sweetness
or
maybe
its
psychological
because
im
offended
by
the
lambic
misnomer
but
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
why
are
they
still
making
this
d
this
is
really
not
a
bad
beer
but
more
than
one
at
a
time
is
way
too
much
the
carbonation
was
good
and
for
what
it
is
i
enjoyed
it
now
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
maybe
two
in
one
sitting
but
i
will
not
any
more
so
vigorously
steer
people
away
from
this
beer
di
will
give
it
the
benefit
of
calling
it
average
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
one
of
these
but
i
can
see
offering
someone
who
would
otherwise
drink
say
a
malternative
and
it
probably
would
be
enjoyed
not
a
drainpour
but
it
takes
up
space
in
the
holiday
12
that
i
would
rather
give
over
to
some
of
the
better
offerings
im
not
too
familiar
with
lambics
id
like
to
have
a
few
more
well
regarded
ones
but
i
did
find
this
beer
enjoyable
at
times
with
all
the
carbonation
it
resembled
a
cranberry
spritzer
regardless
i
did
find
it
overall
enjoyable
md
this
is
definitely
sour
not
so
much
in
traditional
lambic
style
i
would
say
more
gueuze
style
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
medium
body
if
you
can
get
past
the
tartness
its
quite
drinkable
drinkability
is
average
as
it
is
a
seasonal
brew
it
serves
its
purpose
to
be
something
different
for
the
holidays
but
good
luck
trying
to
kill
a
twelvepack
of
this
stuff
as
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
senses
maybe
the
best
part
of
the
beer
a
touch
on
the
fizzy
side
with
a
slick
finish
but
otherwise
ok
i
appreciate
sam
adams
trying
to
incorporate
an
american
ingredient
in
one
of
their
beers
but
it
seems
as
though
corners
were
cut
in
order
to
make
the
brew
more
costeffective
and
palatable
to
the
masses
right
up
there
with
lienies
berry
weiss
in
terms
of
a
good
idea
done
poorly
the
pour
is
shocking
only
because
your
expectation
of
what
comes
from
the
bottle
is
completely
shattered
by
what
appears
to
be
a
pink
soda
complete
with
the
requisite
head
suffice
it
to
say
i
was
a
bit
concerned
undaunted
by
my
desire
to
get
through
the
holiday
sampler
i
soldiered
on
only
to
find
the
taste
to
be
palatable
but
not
inspiring
the
cransberry
is
present
and
its
a
thoughtful
thing
for
the
holidays
but
like
so
much
christmas
choch
its
a
good
thing
we
only
have
to
deal
with
it
for
a
few
weeks
pours
a
murky
red
gold
color
with
a
slightly
pink
tinted
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
some
slight
lacing
smells
of
tart
cranberries
but
rather
muddled
there
is
an
underlying
bitterness
and
some
dry
maltiness
there
as
well
the
taste
is
like
thanksgiving
cranberry
sauce
pretty
overwhelmingly
cranberry
without
a
lot
of
depth
or
nuance
bitter
throughout
and
lacks
sweetness
very
tannic
and
bittersour
in
the
mouth
this
beer
tastes
fresh
and
like
real
cranberries
but
its
just
too
far
out
of
balance
and
a
bit
too
harsh
d
the
word
lambic
may
be
on
the
label
but
this
is
a
glorified
fruit
beer
i
was
optimistic
even
given
the
poor
reviews
on
this
one
but
i
must
agree
with
the
masses
that
this
is
an
average
at
best
brew
its
absence
from
next
years
samuel
adams
winter
pack
wouldnt
upset
me
greatly
pours
a
bit
muddled
no
real
red
color
just
cloudy
brown
smells
of
malt
only
no
fruit
taste
is
straight
cranberry
if
you
like
it
youll
love
this
beer
i
am
pretty
meh
on
cranberry
personally
finish
is
good
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
loveit
or
hateit
beer
d
its
not
terrible
in
fact
it
tastes
decent
but
theres
a
reason
there
arent
many
beers
like
this
one
its
extremely
onedimensional
and
not
that
great
at
that
dimension
in
the
first
place
ok
i
had
my
cranberry
lambic
for
this
year
next
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
one
inch
tight
white
head
generous
amounts
of
tiny
effervescing
bubbles
adhered
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
residual
spatters
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
nose
consisted
of
sour
tangy
fruity
esters
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
cranberry
character
is
finally
revealed
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
fell
between
light
and
medium
with
a
mild
effervescence
in
the
background
but
a
little
prickly
at
the
finish
due
to
some
acidity
better
than
i
anticipated
however
the
two
i
received
in
the
winter
mix
pack
were
sufficient
the
feel
is
bubbly
like
champagne
but
also
thick
and
syrupy
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
solid
beer
tart
and
sweet
not
really
a
traditional
lambic
despite
its
astringency
not
a
bitter
note
to
be
found
just
berries
and
belgian
spices
i
just
realized
that
my
c
rating
is
the
average
so
i
guess
i
do
feel
the
same
way
as
everyone
else
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
slightly
better
cranberry
zima
wheres
the
beer
to
be
honest
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
warmed
up
to
me
still
will
probably
never
drink
again
d
funky
flavor
but
thin
body
the
pour
is
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
head
the
nose
is
very
cranberry
and
molasses
there
were
hints
of
malt
too
the
taste
seem
like
chemical
cranberry
with
sweetness
i
was
expecting
a
bit
of
tartness
but
it
didnt
show
through
the
palate
the
finish
was
long
and
just
ok
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
than
just
okay
ill
finish
the
other
one
in
the
pack
but
if
offered
one
ill
ask
what
else
is
available
d
not
very
good
somethin
just
aint
right
with
this
stuff
the
cranberry
is
just
too
sweet
and
artificial
total
lack
of
carbonation
a
little
tartness
would
probably
help
this
brew
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
unique
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
it
is
a
reddish
color
in
the
glass
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
little
head
there
is
something
sickly
in
the
nose
on
this
one
it
just
isnt
quite
right
taste
is
another
matter
very
sweet
up
front
loads
of
maple
sugar
and
then
the
cranberry
bitterness
sets
in
and
does
its
work
ending
is
tart
fairly
slick
up
front
but
ends
up
fairly
watery
by
the
end
of
the
beer
truly
a
unique
offering
and
definitely
worth
a
buy
in
the
winter
mix
pack
pours
a
clear
orangeish
red
with
no
head
retention
and
spotty
lacing
smell
unexpectedly
smells
like
a
hefeweizen
more
than
a
wit
or
a
lambic
yeasty
bananaesque
light
wheat
malts
cranberry
juice
in
the
background
taste
wheat
malts
cran
juice
slightly
yeasty
and
tangy
and
yes
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
im
glad
i
dont
pick
up
the
maple
syrup
that
is
in
this
other
than
the
sweetness
left
behind
mouthfeel
soft
wheat
beer
feel
not
much
of
a
lambic
but
not
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
im
not
a
fruit
beer
fan
not
sure
why
everyone
enjoys
slamming
this
beer
so
much
ive
had
much
worse
taste
is
cranberry
with
a
belgian
wit
beer
flavor
hops
are
not
evident
mouthfeel
was
just
fine
for
a
fruit
beer
while
not
generally
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
this
was
more
drinkable
than
most
wont
have
any
difficulty
drinking
the
other
in
this
box
wonder
who
i
can
ditch
the
other
from
the
winter
12
pack
on
d
since
i
dont
like
the
taste
this
leaves
little
to
the
imagination
on
my
thoughts
for
drinkability
i
like
a
lot
of
the
samuel
adams
beers
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
them
too
bad
my
winter
pack
has
become
a
10
pack
instead
of
a
12
pack
thought
my
wife
might
drink
the
second
one
but
by
the
look
on
her
face
that
one
will
be
going
to
waste
though
they
may
not
be
the
most
adventurous
of
brewers
sam
adams
has
always
been
the
model
of
consistant
decent
beers
where
did
this
come
from
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
would
choose
not
to
drink
more
than
two
or
three
blech
maroon
pour
with
a
short
head
aroma
of
cough
syrup
and
cranberries
candylike
cranberry
taste
and
ethyl
alcohol
again
like
cough
syrup
i
like
cranberries
and
thought
this
would
be
good
its
not
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
and
hit
a
bottle
of
nyquil
as
average
as
this
beer
is
i
dont
know
why
people
buy
them
but
whatever
floats
there
boat
d
i
didnt
enjoy
this
all
that
much
doesnt
taste
like
a
true
lambic
to
me
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
that
great
either
it
is
however
pretty
tasty
and
is
a
fair
example
of
the
style
definitely
a
good
pickup
for
parties
where
you
know
there
will
be
people
who
dont
usually
drink
beer
not
bad
for
the
style
of
a
fruitwheat
beer
but
subpar
for
a
lambic
dont
believe
the
antihype
give
it
a
try
drinkability
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
all
year
long
d
this
one
was
a
lot
different
than
i
was
expecting
from
its
name
it
was
very
sweet
but
not
a
pleasant
sweet
it
is
a
fun
one
to
try
mid
body
enough
carbonation
my
least
favorite
in
the
twelve
pack
i
am
not
a
big
cranberry
fan
i
love
craisins
though
this
beer
is
not
as
bad
as
everyone
says
it
is
it
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
beer
everyday
but
cranberrys
are
festive
and
this
is
a
great
holiday
beverage
the
beer
pours
to
a
medium
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
head
the
smell
is
not
so
good
it
sorta
smells
like
rancid
cranberrys
the
taste
is
dry
and
tart
its
quite
interesting
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
and
thankfully
there
are
only
2
in
the
twelve
pack
i
enjoy
this
beer
once
a
year
its
the
holiday
season
rejoice
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
hints
of
red
and
orange
a
light
pink
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
of
cranberries
nothing
spectacular
but
can
notice
a
little
funkiness
in
the
nose
taste
is
slightly
sweet
like
cranberry
juice
mixed
with
beer
a
light
tartness
is
present
mouthfeel
is
ok
slightly
creamy
not
very
drinkable
im
only
drinking
this
because
nobody
else
wants
it
out
of
the
variety
pack
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
not
horrible
but
not
good
either
drinkability
is
low
i
will
never
drink
this
again
as
it
was
hard
enough
to
finish
the
bottle
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
bad
enough
i
wish
mr
adams
would
stop
lying
to
me
about
what
his
beer
is
supposed
to
be
got
this
in
a
case
with
six
other
sam
adams
this
one
was
not
one
of
the
best
i
plan
on
getting
some
more
of
the
sample
packs
and
these
will
hopefully
be
enjoyed
by
visitors
my
wife
not
a
fan
either
and
she
likes
both
fruit
beers
and
lambics
d
very
drinkable
almost
like
a
light
beer
as
a
rare
holiday
specialty
brew
i
can
enjoy
this
even
make
it
somewhat
of
a
ritual
considering
the
other
brews
that
come
in
the
holiday
box
by
itself
the
brew
is
interesting
on
the
first
bottle
but
might
grow
bland
pretty
quick
really
i
have
no
complaints
though
this
is
my
first
so
i
have
no
way
of
really
knowing
but
i
have
to
wonder
if
sa
hasnt
changed
the
recipe
for
this
year
2008
i
think
it
stands
up
better
than
the
reviews
would
lead
one
to
believe
nice
sort
of
reddish
hue
to
itnot
quite
pink
decent
head
that
definately
has
a
pink
look
about
it
somewhat
funky
aromaearthy
and
yeasty
tart
cherry
like
flavor
up
front
crisp
wheat
taste
just
funky
enough
tasting
to
get
by
wet
sort
of
cardboard
flavors
ok
enough
body
not
a
bad
beer
in
general
if
you
ask
me
doesnt
deserve
the
slamming
it
gets
here
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
but
in
a
variety
12er
i
find
this
ok
a
decent
gateway
but
maybe
move
on
asap
eat
drink
and
be
merry
taste
is
very
very
faint
cranberry
i
think
its
cranberry
slightly
off
and
smokey
definitely
not
a
lambic
very
thin
in
mouthfeel
this
is
going
to
be
a
chore
to
finish
my
wife
loves
lambicsthis
is
not
a
lambic
poured
this
into
a
large
wine
glass
since
i
dont
have
a
lambic
glass
and
since
this
is
the
way
she
always
gets
it
in
bars
cloudy
light
tan
with
a
hint
of
red
in
the
haze
weak
head
that
quickly
disappeared
some
aroma
of
cranberries
but
no
where
near
what
i
was
expecting
little
or
no
flavor
i
guess
someone
showed
a
cranberry
to
the
bottle
my
wife
the
lambic
lover
took
2
sips
made
a
wierd
face
and
handed
me
the
glass
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
offering
from
sam
adams
this
was
the
only
complete
dud
in
the
sampler
dlow
drinkability
not
very
tasty
wont
look
forward
to
this
beer
in
the
future
luckily
only
2
bottles
out
of
the
holiday
sampler
12
pack
alright
so
i
wasnt
quite
as
disgusted
by
this
beer
as
lots
of
folks
seem
to
have
been
in
my
opinion
it
was
a
fine
example
of
a
style
thats
just
not
particularly
interesting
or
noteworthy
but
one
that
im
okay
to
try
every
so
often
pours
a
deep
reddish
color
with
a
small
head
and
light
lacing
nose
is
strong
cranberry
sweetness
smells
similar
to
how
fruit
beers
smell
not
really
beery
but
not
necessarily
bad
taste
is
similar
although
definitely
has
some
bitterness
appropriate
to
the
cranberry
a
touch
of
beery
malt
in
there
no
real
hops
except
for
maybe
in
that
bitterness
feel
is
high
in
carbonation
medium
in
body
overall
its
really
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
although
nothing
particularly
interesting
either
my
wife
liked
it
thankfully
this
beer
only
comes
around
during
the
winter
and
is
not
served
in
six
packs
if
it
were
to
be
sold
in
the
latter
though
i
would
avoid
at
all
costs
pours
a
reddishpink
color
with
an
offpink
head
that
stays
around
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
cant
say
i
can
pick
out
the
caramel
as
others
did
taste
is
tart
and
sour
like
cranberries
but
it
had
a
metallic
aftertaste
i
had
this
beer
last
year
and
it
didnt
taste
like
this
was
a
tad
smoother
and
less
tartness
tried
the
2nd
bottle
out
of
my
winter
variety
pack
and
it
was
the
same
taste
very
disappointed
with
this
years
lambic
not
really
a
favorite
but
im
glad
it
is
in
the
variety
pack
well
it
is
what
it
is
i
think
most
by
now
know
this
is
a
feable
attempt
at
a
lambic
it
isnt
even
close
body
is
a
pinkred
color
with
a
pinkish
white
head
smells
of
tart
fruit
and
as
does
the
taste
cranberry
is
definitely
there
with
a
little
bit
of
spicey
wheat
or
yeast
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
light
feeling
beer
might
be
good
before
dinner
somthing
to
start
out
a
social
event
with
d
okay
would
liked
a
bit
of
cranberry
tartness
which
is
missing
from
this
one
drinkability
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
this
lambic
i
could
not
enjoy
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
overall
one
of
the
less
impressive
beers
in
sam
adams
lineup
but
i
give
them
credit
for
putting
it
out
ok
im
suprised
i
really
like
this
this
has
some
of
the
funky
earthy
qualities
i
like
in
belgian
ales
more
sour
cherries
than
anything
in
the
smell
and
taste
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
clean
slightly
sour
finish
i
hated
samuel
adams
cherry
wheat
it
kept
me
from
trying
this
this
is
definately
a
love
it
or
hate
it
brew
i
love
it
oh
since
ive
read
the
other
reviews
after
posting
mine
this
is
not
a
true
lambic
but
if
it
is
a
fruit
beer
it
is
the
first
one
ive
enjoyed
m
d
medium
body
and
a
little
oiliness
but
thats
about
where
it
ends
not
a
bad
feeling
but
none
of
the
dryness
that
i
might
hope
for
overall
its
a
doable
beer
and
i
dont
see
myself
pouring
the
others
in
the
winter
pack
but
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
otherwise
d
of
course
this
one
came
as
part
of
the
winter
mixed
12
pack
this
is
the
one
that
ive
heard
nothing
but
terrible
things
about
its
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
was
told
or
expecting
the
bottle
was
easy
enough
to
finish
and
after
i
got
used
to
the
rush
of
oddly
combined
flavors
i
liked
it
its
nothing
i
could
drink
as
a
staple
but
wouldnt
mind
every
so
often
drinkability
good
for
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
its
not
bad
and
tastes
fine
but
i
dont
think
this
thing
is
a
lambic
by
any
stretch
of
the
definition
thankfully
this
was
in
the
winter
sampler
only
have
1
more
of
these
to
go
the
rest
of
the
pack
is
good
not
going
to
say
i
am
reviewing
this
to
style
since
i
dont
hit
the
lambics
very
often
but
this
is
overall
pretty
soso
overall
good
to
drink
with
thanksgiving
dinner
and
as
the
bottle
sais
it
would
pair
nice
with
a
good
piece
of
cheesecake
drinkability
this
is
a
transient
life
if
you
can
set
still
for
2
or
3
of
these
you
will
certainly
be
ok
i
dont
know
what
im
going
to
do
with
the
2ond
one
in
my
holiday
pack
d
the
only
reason
that
i
would
have
more
is
because
the
taste
is
so
intriguing
that
i
want
to
know
more
the
drink
is
spritzy
and
macro
lager
lightbodied
with
a
sting
of
soda
popstyle
carbonation
a
single
bottle
is
plenty
for
me
at
any
one
sitting
two
per
holiday
season
is
plenty
until
the
winter
classics
arrive
this
time
next
year
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
it
is
probably
for
some
people
but
not
for
me
thought
id
post
some
extra
thoughts
dont
go
into
this
thinking
it
is
a
lambic
it
is
not
it
is
a
cider
plain
and
simple
for
a
cider
it
is
pretty
good
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
hardly
what
id
call
a
lambic
there
is
not
brett
funk
or
sourness
in
the
taste
it
does
however
have
a
nice
character
and
is
not
too
bad
of
a
fruit
beer
drinkability
pretty
damn
sweet
but
better
than
we
expected
could
probably
split
a
second
one
but
nothing
after
that
nose
was
again
cranberry
along
with
all
the
characteristics
of
sams
wheat
bears
the
flavor
on
this
those
was
quite
nice
a
refreshing
wheat
that
moved
to
some
cranberry
essence
the
beer
was
light
and
crisp
while
i
cant
take
down
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
now
do
not
dread
anything
in
the
sam
adams
mix
pack
and
actually
welcome
it
d
as
it
recommended
on
the
bottle
i
could
see
this
going
along
well
with
a
desert
or
to
someone
who
does
not
prefer
the
taste
of
anything
not
a
fruit
beer
ah
who
the
hell
am
i
kidding
i
would
buy
this
for
my
girlfriend
d
ill
prolly
never
buy
it
i
got
it
with
the
holiday
sampler
so
i
might
as
well
review
it
i
really
dont
like
fruit
beer
so
maybe
it
just
was
not
for
me
it
tasted
awful
and
i
had
to
struggle
to
finish
it
i
gave
the
second
from
my
sampler
away
no
need
to
waste
beer
d
the
first
time
ive
poured
out
a
beer
in
a
loooong
time
d
not
really
i
really
cant
say
anything
more
than
these
are
just
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
for
me
i
couldnt
finish
it
and
even
the
wife
found
them
too
sweet
and
tough
to
put
down
i
agree
with
the
previous
post
this
is
the
stinker
in
the
winter
mixed
pack
there
has
to
be
something
better
to
add
to
the
holiday
sampler
nice
winter
brew
upon
the
second
go
around
with
this
beer
few
years
after
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
i
have
come
to
appreciate
it
alot
more
good
taste
not
overpowering
with
the
crans
wish
it
wasnt
just
in
the
winter
pack
but
oh
well
still
nice
to
get
it
sometime
during
the
year
drinkability
this
is
the
beer
that
stains
the
pack
why
would
they
include
such
a
rechid
beer
inside
a
pack
with
such
strong
contenders
the
holiday
porter
old
fezziwig
cream
stout
winter
lager
are
top
winter
brews
but
this
beer
is
a
joke
jim
koch
needs
to
reorganize
this
pack
next
year
and
put
this
stuff
on
the
retired
list
im
going
to
go
against
the
common
grain
here
because
i
find
this
to
be
a
unique
and
rather
grand
fruit
beer
fully
aware
that
the
name
is
misleading
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
a
true
lambic
and
enjoyed
a
couple
with
an
open
mind
served
in
a
small
goblet
i
waited
and
swirled
and
allowed
this
one
to
warm
up
and
breathe
golden
orange
color
with
a
light
reddish
tint
a
huge
white
head
crested
the
glass
and
ultimately
dwindled
down
lots
of
white
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
a
lazy
constant
carbonation
aroma
is
tame
and
is
of
sour
fruit
makes
me
pucker
slightly
as
i
sniff
it
sharp
and
awkward
on
the
palate
at
first
this
one
got
smoother
and
friendlier
as
it
sat
wonderful
flavor
very
unique
yet
something
familiar
it
took
me
halfway
into
my
2nd
bottle
to
realize
that
i
had
made
a
dark
raspberry
wheat
homebrew
a
year
or
so
ago
with
some
similar
flavor
anyway
this
has
an
initial
sour
taste
the
cranberry
flavor
is
subdued
but
comes
through
in
the
middle
after
that
crisp
sourness
is
a
small
burst
of
dry
sweets
honey
in
nature
but
likely
the
maple
syrup
used
in
the
recipe
this
was
well
enjoyed
with
some
fancy
chocolates
dropped
off
at
the
office
as
a
holiday
gift
i
would
have
loved
to
have
had
a
few
of
these
during
thanksgiving
seems
to
be
a
good
fit
for
a
hearty
turkey
dinner
maybe
next
year
d
im
generally
not
a
big
fruit
beer
fanespecially
of
the
sam
adams
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
however
this
is
a
pretty
decent
fruit
beer
from
sam
adams
d
maybe
this
one
does
go
well
with
dessert
as
the
label
states
its
not
a
good
one
to
drink
by
itself
but
i
could
definitely
see
some
cooking
uses
for
this
beer
d
one
is
enough
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
tartness
coats
the
mouth
with
thisone
drinkability
is
okay
it
is
not
a
drainpour
beer
but
you
have
to
be
ready
for
the
tartness
the
only
brew
from
sam
that
i
have
not
liked
very
much
just
not
my
style
the
combonation
doesnt
seem
to
work
sam
adams
should
shelve
this
on
for
good
d
yeah
its
easy
to
drink
drinkability
may
end
up
a
drain
pour
not
positive
yet
this
is
the
first
sam
adams
brew
that
has
let
me
down
i
tried
to
take
to
this
beer
with
an
open
mind
after
all
the
negative
reviews
but
now
i
understand
them
next
year
when
i
get
the
sam
adams
winter
mix
pack
ill
be
saving
this
one
for
when
im
really
drunk
and
dont
care
about
the
taste
but
still
want
something
to
keep
the
party
going
sorry
this
one
gets
in
my
opinion
an
undeservedly
bad
rap
from
the
majority
of
reviewers
and
while
the
name
is
misleading
and
this
is
no
true
lambic
and
while
every
palate
is
different
and
no
palate
is
wrong
i
believe
that
a
great
number
of
negative
reviews
are
not
objective
but
are
based
rather
in
large
part
on
prior
negative
reviews
this
may
not
be
the
best
that
bbc
has
to
offer
but
i
most
certainly
wouldnt
call
it
the
worst
either

mfd
fruit
beers
arent
really
my
thing
and
this
one
was
certainly
noting
special
id
much
rather
they
put
some
more
holiday
porter
or
fizzywig
in
the
sampler
and
skip
this
one
next
year
i
couldnt
get
through
the
entire
bottle
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
certainly
isnt
good
future
outlook
a
horrifying
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
winter
classics
mix
pack
which
in
spite
of
this
i
will
surely
pick
up
again
next
season
looks
like
the
cranberry
lambics
will
be
given
out
as
part
of
white
elephant
gifts
to
poor
unsuspecting
family
membersfriends
poured
into
a
pint
glass
sickly
clear
guavastrawberry
color
with
a
pinkishecru
head
that
fizzles
into
nothing
within
a
minute
smells
like
crangrape
juice
and
mealy
old
wheat
artificial
sweet
fruitiness
that
isnt
particularly
reminiscent
of
cranberry
big
maple
syrup
note
that
turns
cloying
thin
bodied
and
not
tart
enough
to
be
called
a
lambic
pretty
much
tastes
like
carbonated
fruit
juice
thumbs
down
d
while
not
the
most
flavorful
thing
and
definitely
not
a
lambic
it
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
a
six
pack
as
i
think
itd
make
a
fine
dessert
beer
not
bad
but
definitely
misnamed
this
beer
is
pretty
much
the
only
reason
i
buy
those
holiday
cases
i
got
turned
onto
flemish
style
ales
a
year
or
two
ago
and
yeah
its
barely
beer
kind
of
sour
almost
wine
and
i
am
hooked
bigtime
jim
koch
described
it
as
a
weird
beer
at
the
night
of
funk
id
put
it
just
under
the
extreme
beer
shelf
cran
lam
has
the
10
a
bottle
funk
for
a
fraction
of
the
price
jim
give
us
a
few
750s
of
this
baby
i
did
try
cooking
with
it
recently
made
a
sauce
with
cranberries
and
this
beer
which
i
reduced
to
a
glaze
and
poured
on
a
roast
turkey
loin
unfortunately
that
didnt
yield
particularly
pleasing
results
either
by
far
the
worst
sam
adams
beer
when
i
buy
the
mixed
12
pack
sampler
i
either
offer
this
for
free
or
pour
it
tastes
like
some
sort
of
weird
alcoholic
apple
juice
just
way
too
sweet
and
the
flavors
dont
mesh
well
together
at
all
i
wish
sa
would
just
do
away
with
this
beer
all
together
i
havent
met
many
people
who
can
even
finish
one
d
well
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
very
untraditional
i
would
have
it
with
thanksgiving
dinner
but
not
more
than
one
beer
in
a
day
if
i
got
this
again
id
probably
give
it
away
instead
of
drinking
it
poured
a
light
amber
with
some
pinkishlight
reddish
hues
with
minimal
head
too
much
juice
and
not
enough
of
that
cloying
thick
almost
choking
fruit
burst
from
belgian
fruitlambic
beers
this
is
like
a
glass
of
cranberry
juice
with
some
sugar
weird
while
there
is
a
heavy
fruit
taste
it
is
thin
compared
to
others
in
the
style
are
made
and
instead
of
that
hearty
dry
backbite
from
a
real
lambic
this
has
a
tart
almost
sour
thin
and
watery
finish
for
a
sharp
cutting
backbite
not
a
good
finish
at
all
sam
adams
can
be
hitormiss
and
this
is
a
miss
this
was
part
of
a
variety
pack
i
recently
purchased
interesting
but
nothing
id
really
look
forward
to
trying
again
copper
color
topped
with
a
small
head
malty
berry
aroma
just
a
little
bit
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
this
is
too
much
like
soda
water
for
me
and
quite
sour
i
guess
thats
the
cranberries
im
tasting
not
much
else
to
it
drinkability
im
not
sure
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
but
i
highly
doubt
ill
be
back
for
seconds
on
this
one
this
rates
right
up
with
the
sam
adams
cheery
wheat
as
my
least
favorite
brews
from
this
company
poured
red
with
a
clearer
hue
strong
aroma
of
cranberries
hops
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
not
all
that
balanced
very
fruity
taste
but
too
sweet
and
sugary
has
more
of
a
malternative
taste
than
a
lambic
not
a
fan
of
lambics
but
wanted
to
give
it
a
shot
cant
drink
too
much
of
this
always
end
up
having
it
once
or
twice
around
christmas
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
fruity
nice
rich
hazy
cherry
with
a
thin
tan
head
not
exactly
lambic
but
a
good
cranberry
flavored
wheat
beer
the
smell
is
of
tart
cranberries
and
wheaty
malts
the
taste
is
similar
lots
of
fruit
a
bit
out
of
balance
this
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
a
drinkable
beer
but
definately
not
a
lambic
more
of
a
flavored
wheat
beer
copper
color
with
a
quickly
disapating
white
head
aroma
of
cranberries
clove
and
fruit
taste
is
sweet
and
very
fruity
having
a
dry
tart
aftertaste
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
as
the
beer
warmed
in
the
glass
it
became
more
tart
over
the
fuitiness
a
good
one
to
try
not
as
fruity
as
a
lambic
but
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
still
a
beer
not
really
a
lambic
but
that
goes
without
saying
d
maybe
with
a
turkey
meal
not
my
type
of
beer
side
note
people
should
stop
hating
on
this
beer
i
agree
that
the
word
lambic
should
probably
be
removed
from
the
label
but
there
is
no
way
that
this
beer
should
taste
offensive
to
anyone
it
is
far
to
bland
to
offend
any
beeradvocates
palate
unless
of
course
they
find
blandness
offensive
which
makes
me
wonder
how
they
would
ever
tolerate
water
i
feel
so
sad
for
these
people
if
they
exist
red
wine
colorno
head
smell
of
fruitcranberry
the
taste
was
fruits
and
cranberry
with
a
touch
of
malt
the
feel
was
light
carbonation
and
sweet
and
sour
stickiness
this
was
not
a
good
beer
i
really
do
not
think
this
is
even
a
beer
i
would
never
try
it
again
and
this
proves
no
one
is
perfect
i
could
not
drink
it
completelythis
has
only
happened
to
me
twice
and
eventually
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
it
seemed
fitting
i
couldnt
take
more
than
a
few
sips
of
this
beer
even
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
drink
id
rather
just
drink
water
instead
of
drinking
this
i
like
other
fruit
beers
but
just
dont
happen
to
like
this
one
for
some
reason
pours
pinkishred
with
a
large
pink
tinted
head
as
well
smell
is
cherry
cranberry
and
a
hit
of
witbier
like
aroma
and
slight
funk
witbier
yeast
interesting
taste
definitely
getting
some
wheat
in
the
finish
and
prior
are
some
slightly
sweet
and
tart
cranberry
and
fruity
notes
bit
too
thin
bodied
and
flavored
however
comes
off
like
a
thin
cranberry
wheat
beer
rather
than
a
lambic
which
it
isnt
even
classified
as
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
a
shot
but
not
a
repeat
buy
for
me
d
this
was
better
than
i
was
anticipating
i
havent
really
ever
been
let
down
by
a
sam
adams
brew
and
this
one
is
no
exception
this
brew
has
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
a
nice
flavor
as
well
d
pungent
sour
fruitiness
that
makes
you
pucker
going
down
to
much
cranberries
when
poured
into
a
corsendonk
christmas
ale
goblet
this
sam
adams
is
a
lightly
hazy
cranberryorange
color
that
had
a
small
white
head
of
foam
this
head
of
foam
quickly
faded
away
into
some
foamy
rings
along
the
edge
and
just
a
few
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
it
had
a
nize
sized
aroma
of
wheat
ripe
cranberries
and
a
dash
of
black
pepper
the
cranberries
and
wheat
were
fine
but
it
was
the
dash
of
black
pepper
that
ruined
it
for
me
the
taste
was
just
carbonated
juicy
cranberries
and
the
slightest
touch
of
malted
wheat
that
was
it
for
the
taste
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
mouthfeel
was
too
light
with
a
faint
aftertaste
of
malted
wheat
and
juicy
cranberries
i
like
the
taste
of
wheat
and
cranberries
but
i
just
didnt
care
for
this
beer
there
just
wasnt
enough
of
anything
in
this
sam
adams
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
if
you
are
a
big
cranberry
fan
the
sweetness
of
the
cranberries
are
not
very
evident
but
the
bitterness
and
tartness
are
very
evident
drinkability
not
impressed
not
something
i
would
want
to
try
again
maby
it
was
because
i
coudnt
find
this
beer
last
year
and
i
was
expecting
to
much
but
this
beer
just
seemed
very
average
nothing
special
this
beer
is
made
with
cultured
yeast
so
i
expected
the
lambic
taste
to
be
faint
and
it
was
but
when
i
could
barly
taste
the
cranberrys
i
was
disipointed
in
fact
i
tasted
the
maple
syrup
more
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
but
will
drink
the
other
one
in
the
fridge
t
it
has
a
tart
taste
thats
too
wet
meaning
its
not
crisp
feels
like
macerated
cranberries
but
without
a
pronounced
cranberry
taste
it
also
doesnt
remind
me
of
the
lambic
style
i
am
all
for
interpretations
but
only
if
its
better
this
is
not
however
an
awful
beer
just
not
my
fav
i
kinda
just
dont
like
the
style
but
this
beer
aint
too
bad
it
is
balanced
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
at
least
has
a
beer
aspect
that
shows
through
the
fruitiness
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
beer
aroma
is
cranberry
and
vinegar
pour
yeilds
a
offwhite
head
with
fair
lacing
peachy
color
taste
is
bitter
and
a
bit
strange
to
my
palate
goes
down
decently
but
a
bit
to
harshly
carbonated
okay
but
will
not
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
beer
this
is
a
vey
week
brew
and
a
disappointment
from
such
a
good
brewery
unfortunate
that
it
comes
with
all
the
other
beers
in
the
winter
sampler
drinkability
is
okay
it
is
not
a
drainpour
beer
but
you
have
to
be
ready
for
the
tartness
after
giving
away
these
for
years
out
of
the
holiday
collection
i
decided
to
try
it
this
will
do
in
a
pinch
d
sorry
but
between
the
odd
sweetness
and
artifical
sourness
theres
not
much
here
i
enjoyed
had
this
one
in
their
winter
sample
pack
the
appearance
was
a
promising
with
a
orangeamber
color
and
thick
head
it
was
a
bit
murky
in
a
cider
like
way
the
smell
was
ripe
with
cranberries
and
spices
so
that
is
not
a
disappointment
the
taste
was
way
to
overpowering
the
cranberry
aftertaste
lasted
awhile
and
was
overpowered
by
the
spices
too
so
you
basically
get
a
strong
lagging
aftertaste
of
synthesized
spicecranberries
sure
it
is
sweet
but
not
in
a
good
way
the
body
of
the
drink
was
pretty
flat
making
it
too
much
like
some
sort
of
cider
drink
overall
i
would
try
other
fruit
beers
andor
lambics
drinkability
well
lambic
this
is
not
but
its
not
the
bad
beer
many
people
make
it
out
to
be
maybe
i
just
got
a
suprisingly
good
bottle
seemed
fresh
and
to
be
perfectly
honset
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
during
the
summer
months
glad
i
went
against
my
judgement
and
tried
it
this
isnt
a
lambic
and
its
not
really
a
cranberry
brew
either
its
too
sweet
to
really
enjoy
more
than
1
bottle
of
i
imagine
it
could
be
some
type
of
gateway
beer
but
its
nothing
i
would
care
to
drink
again
d
i
think
you
would
be
better
off
drinking
this
with
your
thanksgiving
meal
but
just
to
watch
a
ball
game
on
tv
no
way
im
not
a
fan
of
fruity
beers
perhaps
women
would
like
this
better
because
of
its
wine
characteristics
just
to
buy
a
sixer
of
these
no
way
d
the
is
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
my
first
drain
pour
taste
proves
this
isnt
a
true
lambic
but
merely
a
fruit
beer
if
comparing
directly
to
a
lambic
it
would
fail
definitely
not
as
sweet
and
tart
as
a
lambic
should
be
as
a
fruit
beer
though
its
decent
at
best
the
cranberry
isnt
overwhelmingly
sweet
but
is
mixed
with
the
malt
and
creates
a
weird
kind
of
tart
finish
this
came
in
my
winter
mix
pack
it
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
fruit
is
strong
and
reminds
me
of
a
wine
it
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
a
wine
cooler
i
dont
really
enjoy
this
beer
probably
one
of
my
least
favorites
by
sam
adams
so
far
the
carbonation
is
really
fine
giving
it
an
almost
too
low
carbonation
feel
it
doesnt
wow
you
with
the
taste
or
anything
but
i
suppose
its
pretty
drinkable
to
the
general
population
because
its
not
offensive
and
goes
down
easily
drinkability
depends
on
what
your
looking
for
not
very
good
for
a
lambic
however
if
you
want
a
sweet
beer
that
will
appeal
to
beer
newcomers
this
is
right
up
your
alley
this
beer
has
a
bad
reputation
but
i
think
that
it
is
quite
good
and
look
forward
to
the
few
bottles
i
have
each
year
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
would
drink
all
the
time
but
good
for
a
once
a
year
sort
of
thing
d
i
would
not
drink
this
again
but
it
was
worth
the
effort
of
trying
i
wonder
if
sam
adams
let
this
one
pick
up
natural
yeasts
or
if
they
sped
the
process
along
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
from
the
boston
beer
co
and
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
true
lambic
to
me
very
unuasual
coloring
with
its
peachyapracot
hue
and
a
very
quikly
disapating
head
smell
is
a
bit
unusual
for
me
it
kind
if
reminds
me
of
cranberry
cocktail
spilled
on
carpet
if
you
can
picture
that
also
kind
of
funky
dont
think
the
cranberry
smells
blend
well
in
the
beer
first
taste
fish
face
as
a
result
of
the
tartiness
not
a
beer
i
can
honesly
rate
on
taste
ans
this
is
my
second
atempt
first
try
i
just
thought
i
was
being
negotive
and
this
time
i
conclude
to
the
same
answer
i
do
not
like
this
beer
overall
im
not
all
that
crazy
about
this
beer
its
ok
to
sample
the
two
in
the
holiday
pack
but
you
wouldnt
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
overall
a
good
tasting
beer
i
will
look
forward
to
next
years
this
is
one
of
the
rare
beers
that
actually
lived
up
to
the
hype
or
notoriety
as
the
case
may
have
it
i
didnt
think
this
beer
could
be
as
bad
as
people
had
made
it
out
to
be
it
may
actually
be
worse
the
fact
that
they
call
this
beer
a
lambic
is
not
nearly
as
offensive
as
the
taste
of
this
offering
d
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
cranberry
but
i
can
appreciate
it
in
a
well
done
beer
this
isnt
one
of
them
d
i
cannot
give
this
any
better
the
a
below
average
for
drinkability
i
certainly
dont
want
another
one
it
is
kind
of
pretty
in
the
glass
and
the
smell
is
interesting
if
not
great
but
i
just
cant
get
past
the
flaws
in
the
taste
moderate
to
pale
golden
body
in
flute
perfectly
foamy
twofinger
white
head
clings
in
varying
lengths
light
yeast
aroma
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
light
bread
dough
the
cranberry
arrives
with
a
little
medicine
feel
to
it
the
malt
suppresses
the
fruit
to
a
degree
lighttomedium
body
rather
dry
and
acidiceffervescent
but
a
bit
of
a
scrape
at
the
throat
a
friend
once
told
me
this
wasnt
by
definition
a
lambic
as
it
doesnt
use
the
strain
or
spontaneously
ferment
although
that
may
affect
the
taste
my
experience
offers
a
dry
bubbly
subdued
version
of
a
lindemans
and
a
trumpedup
version
of
any
proliferation
of
other
american
fruit
beers
crafted
simply
to
increase
a
brewerys
selection
surprised
to
see
the
rather
harsh
treatment
of
this
beer
the
kenny
g
of
lambics
d
drinkability
is
low
i
had
to
force
this
one
down
as
i
never
have
poured
out
a
beer
this
was
very
close
to
being
the
first
one
this
beer
had
the
apperance
and
smell
of
greatness
i
had
bought
the
sam
adams
winter
classics
and
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
it
it
was
a
bit
tart
and
was
not
like
any
beer
i
had
ever
had
its
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
herty
meal
but
thats
about
it
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
them
during
on
sitting
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
reccomend
it
if
you
are
looking
for
an
exotic
tasting
beer
id
best
compare
its
mouthfeel
to
what
id
imagine
as
a
jolly
rancher
beer
a
jolly
rancher
italian
soda
beer
doesnt
ring
as
well
as
cranberry
limbic
when
poured
into
the
glass
the
color
was
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
there
was
hardly
any
foam
and
no
lace
at
all
them
smell
was
of
hops
and
sweet
fruit
the
taste
was
of
hops
and
fruit
it
was
sort
of
thick
didnt
notice
it
when
poured
but
you
could
feel
the
thickness
of
this
ale
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
slight
bitter
acidic
fruity
feel
on
the
tongue
when
drinking
this
ale
not
bad
would
drink
it
again
different
bright
highly
carbonated
and
lighter
bodied
tasty
and
refreshing
with
a
slightly
buttery
texture
in
the
finish
a
nice
festive
starter
brew
that
tends
to
lead
people
who
may
be
new
to
craft
beer
toward
slightly
more
acquired
styles
such
as
lambics
gueuzes
sours
and
saisons
d
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
true
lambic
beer
being
far
from
an
expert
but
a
nice
beer
none
the
less
an
enjoyable
beer
i
wish
this
wasnt
in
every
winter
classics
package
i
would
love
to
see
a
scotch
ale
or
something
else
take
its
place
notes
what
the
hell
is
sam
adams
thinking
with
this
beer
and
why
do
they
keep
making
it
its
truly
terrible
stuff
pours
murky
gold
with
reddish
hue
fuity
aroma
obviously
cranberries
cinnamon
and
cloves
taste
is
tart
but
not
overly
so
sweet
light
malt
provides
some
balance
spicy
finish
cloves
again
kind
of
like
spiced
cider
the
cranberry
taste
is
there
but
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
light
mouthfeel
low
to
moderate
carbonation
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
too
much
of
nice
try
this
was
actually
my
very
first
sam
adams
pity
couldnt
even
finish
the
bottle
glad
i
bought
just
the
one
d
this
is
a
good
holiday
beer
i
enjoy
some
fruit
beers
abita
purple
haze
and
strawberry
harvest
lager
and
sa
did
a
good
job
with
this
lambic
however
i
would
not
seek
this
out
throughout
the
year
it
is
perfect
as
a
seasonal
and
i
look
forward
to
it
over
the
holidays
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a

chalice
poured
a
pinky
amber
with
a
pretty
big
head
left
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
as
the
liquid
fell
wow
i
drink
this
every
year
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
did
it
sober
smell
is
of
grapefruit
apricot
and
bad
sacramental
wine
taste
is
a
bit
sour
with
fake
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
were
talking
concentrate
here
overtones
mouthfeel
is
light
and
with
a
dry
finish
drinking
this
beer
sober
makes
me
cringe
when
i
think
about
drinking
the
second
one
in
the
winter
seasonal
mix
overall
neither
a
lambic
nor
cranberry
this
one
is
more
of
a
fruitflavored
wit
as
an
odd
offthewall
brew
that
might
be
accessible
to
joe
sixpack
its
acceptable
but
as
a
classic
lambic
its
a
complete
dud
its
a
fruit
beer
and
as
fruit
beers
go
its
an
enjoyable
one
as
a
lambic
subtle
tartness
or
are
a
style
purist
who
abhors
all
american
interpretations
i
just
wish
they
would
call
it
cranberry
wheat
or
something

not
much
else
of
course
though
i
did
manage
to
finish
it

to

lambic
is
not

of

light
crisp
taste
with
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
lightly
fruity
with
a
bit
of
lingering
malt
this
beer
was
not
very
lambiclike
and
not
even
very
beerlike
i
like
cranberries
so
that
was
not
an
issue
d
perfect
for
the
holiday
season
but
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
unfortunately
the
beer
isnt
much
better
the
cranberry
lacks
tartness
and
the
beer
lacks
balance
as
the
almost
sour
taste
interferes
with
any
possible
dry
fruit
flavors
the
sticky
sweet
caramel
malts
dont
help
much
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
not
awful
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
would
look
elsewhere
for
your
lambic
fix
d
no
its
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
lambic
but
im
going
to
overlook
that
for
now
i
think
to
the
open
minded
this
beer
doesnt
suck
but
for
those
that
dislike
fruit
beers
out
right
they
wont
dig
on
this
one
either
me
its
one
of
those
beers
that
when
i
see
it
i
know
its
the
holiday
season
and
that
makes
me
smile
and
its
original
there
really
isnt
another
beer
on
the
market
that
tastes
like
it
for
better
or
for
worse
d
extremely
drinkable
and
certainly
much
better
than
expected
one
of
the
most
balanced
fruit
beers
ive
had
for
sure
calling
this
beer
a
lambic
may
be
a
bit
extreme
but
i
thoroughly
look
forward
to
drinking
this
time
and
time
again
drinkability
is
not
so
good
this
beer
is
just
too
sweet
with
no
balancing
components
judged
as
a
fruit
beer
it
isnt
so
bad
but
even
with
brewing
techniques
aside
this
is
not
a
lambic
a
touch
too
alcopoplike
in
every
way
not
my
favorite
samuel

offering
this
beer
pours
a
clean
light
tanish
orange
with
a
touch
of
an
amber
hue
decent
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
light
thin
lace
down
the
pint
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
there
is
certainly
a
fruit
scent
present
in
the
nose
with
a
slight
hint
of
cranberry
i
guess
tones
of
dough
like
yeast
in
there
as
well
there
is
an
extremely
over
powering
presence
of
yeast
in
the
taste
rather
interesting
mix
of
light
fruit
flavors
though
it
is
certainly
more
of
a
different
taste
than
i
would
like
it
reminds
me
of
a
flat
watered
downed
fruit
flavored
soda
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
fruit
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
my
pallet
just
does
not
hold
a
special
spot
for
this
one
some
like
it
and
some
dont
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
medium
amber
color
with
a
thin
quickly
disappearing
head
aroma
was
strange
reminded
me
of
green
olives
the
flavor
had
almost
nothing
to
do
with
cranberry
it
did
taste
slightly
fruity
sweet
which
could
have
been
almost
anything
but
also
tasted
a
hint
of
salt
the
flavor
did
seem
to
fade
over
time
it
was
easy
to
drink
went
down
quickly
an
easy
to
drink
beer
nothing
special
and
probally
not
one
i
will
seek
out
again
it
says
cranberry
but
it
could
be
pretty
much
any
fruit
you
want
it
to
be
but
i
would
rather
it
be
anything
but
in
front
of
me
because
it
was
too
sweet
to
generic
and
too
compromising
a
name
along
doesnt
give
a
beer
an
identity
and
this
is
ringing
proof
of
that
the
sole
saving
grace
if
i
can
stretch
and
call
it
that
is
that
its
sweet
enough
to
stand
up
to
a
bevy
of
assertive
savory
appetizers
failing
those
though
i
cant
think
of
a
good
reason
to
go
this
away
again
samuel
adams
cranberry
lambic
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
well
the
aroma
is
definitely
cranberries
cranberries
are
noticeable
in
the
taste
too
but
this
beer
is
sweet
and
not
well
balanced
theres
some
wheat
at
the
end
but
its
not
very
prominent
im
neither
a
big
cranberry
fan
or
a
fruit
beer
fan
but
ive
certainly
had
better
fruit
beers
eric
it
was
far
to
sweet
to
be
drunk
on
its
own
unless
you
absolutely
love
the
taste
of
cranberries
you
will
not
like
this
beer
it
is
as
though
a
light
beer
was
mixed
with
a
cranberry
juice
and
tada
its
decent
for
a
lambic
and
worth
a
shot
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
drink
a
whole
bottle
again
but
perhaps
a
small
glass
of
it
because
its
sharp
bitter
cranberry
taste
is
nose
has
a
sharp
repressive
feel
that
is
quite
undesirable
and
it
is
the
same
taste
that
lasts
once
its
done
its
mouth
feel
reminded
me
of
champagne
the
most
redeemable
quality
of
this
beer
and
the
intense
fruit
reminded
me
of
sharp
red
wine
which
is
exactly
how
i
would
drink
it
again
in
small
amounts
like
a
wine
glass
drinkability
this
isnt
really
a
beer
but
i
wish
my
friends
would
drink
this
instead
of
their
smirnoff
triple
blacks
i
honestly
associate
this
with
sugary
malt
beverages
but
this
has
to
be
the
best
one
i
have
had
i
say
dont
fear
it
and
its
not
as
bad
as
its
made
out
to
be
its
not
a
lambic
its
a
wheat
cranberry
cocktail
enjoy
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
good
beer
for
your
woman
you
can
convince
her
its
more
like
a
fruity
champagne
drinkabilityit
may
just
be
that
this
is
not
my
kind
of
beer
but
i
really
dont
like
this
one
i
like
this
beer
although
im
not
sure
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
lambic
style
it
seems
like
something
different
maybe
more
like
a
flemish
red
but
with
more
of
a
buttery
taste
i
dont
really
know
how
to
classify
it
other
than
its
still
a
pretty
good
and
unique
beer
very
drinkable
and
some
good
carbonation
giving
it
a
nice
enticing
mouthfeel
i
can
definitely
taste
the
cranberries
although
theyre
more
mellowed
out
with
less
sourness
than
cranberry
juice
normally
has
i
think
sam
adams
is
being
very
creative
with
their
brews
and
this
one
deserves
a
try
especially
when
one
is
tired
of
the
normal
dark
stoutporters
the
smooth
ambers
and
the
crisp
citrusy
lagers
that
seem
to
be
ubiquitous
nowadays
variety
is
nice
and
experimentation
sometimes
works
even
if
it
doesnt
quite
fit
in
the
category
it
is
supposed
to
its
not
really
much
of
a
lambic
but
the
wild
yeast
makes
this
an
anomaly
some
people
hate
this
and
others
love
it
im
somewhere
in
between
its
not
a
favorite
but
its
not
bad
either
tried
as
part
of
their
winter
variety
pack
seems
a
bit
out
of
character
from
what
id
normally
expect
from
boston
b
c
a
classic
sourness
caught
me
a
bit
off
guard
because
of
the
genuine
lambic
character
sweetened
with
malts
or
sugars
to
reduce
the
sourness
to
a
solid
tartness
the
lambic
tartness
along
with
the
cranberry
tartness
made
for
a
plesant
complex
flavor
still
sweetened
to
drinkable
levels
the
appearance
is
a
very
nonassuming
straw
color
with
firm
head
retention
and
carbonation
aromas
grab
hold
with
a
pleasant
sweettart
character
very
clean
and
palatecleansing
in
the
finish
cranberries
make
for
a
christmas
brew
but
id
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
heat
of
summer
drinkability
is
ok
not
something
i
would
have
very
often
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
either
donated
by
a
friend
from
work
part
of
the
winter
12pack
pour
a
clear
yellowamber
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
quickly
faded
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
fruity
flavor
has
a
little
wheat
but
is
for
the
most
part
cranberry
fairly
tart
with
just
a
little
sweetness
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
i
enjoy
trying
it
again
every
christmas
but
not
something
id
drink
regularly
the
beer
had
an
amber
color
with
a
fine
foam
that
dissipated
as
i
drank
the
cranberry
scent
was
refreshing
after
several
months
of
light
beer
and
it
was
a
welcome
change
the
taste
at
first
was
good
but
as
approached
the
last
third
of
the
bottle
the
flavor
started
to
become
bland
and
unsatisfying
it
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
other
sam
adams
beers
and
it
was
very
dry
as
a
seasonal
beer
its
fine
but
i
would
never
choose
it
as
a
frequent
beer
curiosity
got
me
on
this
one
although
it
was
one
of
two
bottles
in
a
holiday
mix
pack
from
sam
adams
this
was
the
second
one
i
tried
poured
a
little
more
copper
than
cranberry
red
like
id
expect
from
lindemans
or
the
such
no
head
retention
at
all
each
sip
came
with
a
different
flavor
as
it
warms
the
sour
cranberries
become
more
pronounced
for
what
it
is
its
not
that
bad
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
expected
as
well
pleasantly
surprised
overall
but
a
bottle
of
this
is
enough
for
now
pours
a
deep
golden
amber
color
not
a
whit
of
haze
and
a
thin
tight
head
smells
bready
and
somewhat
musty
i
admit
i
struggle
to
smell
any
berries
here
a
few
more
deep
sniffs
reveal
a
roundy
sweetness
that
may
just
be
that
cranberry
thing
taste
ah
yes
heres
the
cranberry
and
some
other
weird
mess
of
things
big
berry
taste
up
front
to
be
sure
but
its
followed
by
a
wall
of
thickness
yeah
maybe
its
a
body
thing
more
than
anything
else
but
i
seem
to
be
getting
the
worst
aspects
of
syrupy
sweetness
combined
with
a
sort
of
sour
thickness
thats
just
not
doing
it
for
me
pours
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
leaving
some
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
and
cranberry
taste
is
mostly
hefe
weizen
like
yeast
with
tartness
and
fruittness
appearing
in
the
finish
modertate
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
this
isnt
very
good
would
be
better
if
there
was
a
lot
more
cranberry
and
lambic
like
tartness
i
dont
like
this
one
it
tastes
like
below
average
homebrew
d
i
thought
this
was
good
dont
really
think
it
qualifys
as
beer
as
it
had
no
characteristics
of
beer
i
would
think
of
it
as
more
of
an
alcoholic
soda
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
served
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
not
a
bad
looking
beer
it
smells
like
cranberries
and
not
much
else
from
what
i
can
tell
tastes
like
sour
cranberries
and
a
bit
of
malt
actually
i
think
it
tastes
like
a
wine
cooler
or
some
other
fruity
malt
beverage

a

they
must

it

not
bad
at
all
id
have
this
again
i
dont
consider
this
a
lambic
so
to
speak
with
a
hint
towards
red
nose
is
nice
and
sweet
with
cranberry
tinge
tastes
clean
but
it
definately
taste
like
there
is
more
than
just
cranberry
in
there
maybe
some
banana
the
beer
also
has
a
very
distict
aftertaste
to
it
i
wont
have
another
even
though
the
12pack
this
came
in
has
two
of
these
in
it
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
cranberry
flavored
soda
spiked
with
some
alcohol
its
far
too
fizzy
and
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
is
the
first
sam

of
which
i
am
definitely
not

in

malternative

should
probably
not

it
oh
well
grab
this

the

and
give
it
to

its
a

experimental
just
doesnt
smell
appetizing
dry
wheat
flavor
with
some
mild
fruitiness
decent
smooth
mouthfeel
i
opened
this
bottle
thinking
these
bleed
away
quickly
the
top
skimpy
it
didnt
lace
as
expected
the
nose
is
odd
and
borderline
gross
and
it
is
frankly
too
cloying
mediumlight
body
aroma
very
pleasant
the
body
is
closer
to
light
than
to
medium
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
but
otherwise
clean
a
surprisingly
good
fruit
beer
there
sufficient
malt
character
to
prevent
cloying
fruity
sweetness
i
think
sam
adams
was
poking
fun
at
themselves
when
calling

refreshing
light
taste
nice
kick
of
lemon
definitely
a
more
summer
beer
just
a
good
all
around
summer
brew
an
ok
summer
beer
nothing
more
this
right
now
is
my
favorite
summer
beer
not
too
sweet
or
fruity
but
nice
enough
to
sit
in
the
hot
sun
by
the
pool
it
tastes
exactly
like
lemonade
pretty
solid
for
the
summer
one
of
my
favorite
spring
yo
summer
goes
really
well
on
the
east
coast
light
citrusy
refreshing
good
intro
or
summer
beer
very
similar
to
leinenkugel
summer
shandy
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
quite
as
good
very
similar
to
their
summer
ale
but
better
imo
refreshing
summer
beer
i
prefer
this
over
the
sam
adams
summer
ale
has
a
sweet
lemon
taste
easy
drinking
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
orange
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
smells
of
sour
lemons
tastes
of
wheat
with
a
nice
blends
enough
lemon
flavor
to
make
a
nice
blend
beer
is
nice
carbonated
very
drinkable
light
bodied
overall
a
good
beer
its
the
7up
of
beers
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
sensory
glass
as
a
beer
and
lemonade
combo
this
is
probably
okay
as
a
goto
beer
many
people
will
probably
bypass
this
as
it
just
doesnt
satisfy
the
taste
buds
like
either
a
light
summer
beer
or
regular
lemonade
would
by
themselves
you
get
more
of
a
slightly
sour
pastitsprime
skunky
beer
flavor
more
than
anything
else
i
dont
know
why
ruin
a
good
malt
beverage
by
adding
lemonade
to
it
i
dont
get
the
appeal
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
good
summer
beer
its
a
good
beach
beer
taste
has
a
bit
too
much
lemonadeesque
flavor
and
the
lager
a
bit
to
biscuity
bordering
on
light
toast
id
like
a
less
sweet
version
with
a
more
neutral
malt
profile
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
radler
and
id
probably
rank
this
below
lienenkugels
summer
shandy
on
my
request
list
overall
this
is
the
second
radler
style
beer
ive
tried
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
would
appeal
to
people
who
do
not
normally
like
beer
because
it
tastes
like
a
soft
drink
the
modest
4
5
abv
means
you
can
enjoy
more
than
one
i
would
not
drink
this
often
but
its
a
good
beach
party
beer
single
bottle
from
a
craft
beer
pick
six
setup
poured
into
a
flute
not
my
preferred
beer
style
but
the
completist
or
obsessive
in
me
wanted
to
try
every
offering
in
the
current
sam
adams
summer
pack
and
rumor
has
it
that
this
tastes
at
least
somewhat
like
a
real
beer
as
opposed
to
some
limp
dick
30
beer
70
juice
blend
sorry
thats
a
cooler
not
a
beer
a
darker
than
expected
yelloworange
gold
rather
like
ginger
ale
with
an
initially
large
frothy
white
had
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
the
aroma
is
not
bad
some
of
the
rich
cereal
notes
one
expects
in
a
helles
the
expected
lemon
rind
and
oil
and
even
a
faint
whiff
of
grassy
noble
hops
on
the
palate
the
lemon
is
tastefully
done
not
overwhelming
the
light
malts
and
there
is
also
a
subtle
candied
ginger
vibe
and
the
hops
seem
to
combine
with
the
fruit
to
yield
a
sweet
lemongrass
tea
effect
not
particularly
sour
a
bit
heftier
than
expected
in
terms
of
body
accompanied
by
a
pleasingly
moderate
degree
of
carbonation
although
ones
biased
expectancies
do
yield
a
slight
desire
for
more
fizz
as
mentioned
not
a
shandy
guy
but
this
is
a
nice
revelation
even
if
i
would
not
purposely
seek
out
this
brew
again
its
a
candy
beer
but
one
with
some
grain
to
shore
it
up
o
now
that
i
read
the
bottle
label
after
starting
the
review
i
see
that
this
beer
perfectly
matches
its
description
it
is
a
light
beer
that
has
been
lightened
even
more
with
some
lemon
soda
or
at
least
lemon
flavors
and
water
why
i
dont
know
and
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
if
i
want
a
shandy
ill
mix
my
own
and
at
least
not
have
to
pay
full
premium
beer
prices
for
something
that
was
conveniently
watered
down
before
i
bought
it
this
is
a
megabrewer
tactic
that
is
not
worthy
of
sam
adams
overall
i
havent
had
many
radlers
and
perhaps
i
was
spoiled
by
the
sixpoint
rad
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
but
i
really
didnt
like
this
due
to
the
sugary
sweetness
i
find
it
amusing
looking
through
the
reviews
that
some
said
it
leaned
toward
having
too
much
beer
in
the
mix
and
others
said
there
was
too
much
lemonade
personally
i
would
side
with
those
that
said
there
was
too
much
beer
but
whatever
was
blended
really
throws
it
off
for
me
not
bad
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
i
just
poured
my
first
sapooro
down
my
drain
and
opened
this
hoping
it
would
take
that
horrid
taste
out
of
my
mouth
it
certainly
did
this
beer
is
wonderful
i
can
definitely
taste
lemons
which
is
something
thats
not
found
in
many
beers
after
my
taste
buds
got
over
the
shock
i
must
say
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
poured
it
from
a
bottle
into
a
british
pint
glass
it
has
a
small
white
head
that
faded
quickly
but
has
left
some
lacing
the
color
is
clear
amber
this
beer
is
perfect
after
a
day
in
the
sun
i
highly
recommend
that
you
try
porch
rocker
o
not
bad
the
lemon
almost
seems
forced
and
instead
of
being
more
nuanced
and
playing
a
supporting
role
it
is
more
the
star
of
the
show
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
could
be
better

cheers
this
porch
rocker
rocks
it
had
a
great
look
when
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
inviting
but
not
overwhelming
the
big
hook
was
the
taste
this
beer
was
truly
meant
for
summer
it
was
an
excellent
pour
that
was
matched
by
its
flavor
it
had
a
great
fruity
zip
that
was
a
perfect
match
for
summer
the
color
was
a
perfect
golden
yellow
this
is
now
on
my
list
for
summer
enjoyment
o
very
good

beer
stay
away
from

if

lover
porch

puts
it
to

great

on

whenever
this
is
a
bright

crystalclear
beer
with
a
small
airy
head

like
lemonfresh
pinesol
or
some
other
countertop
cleaner
ugh
just
sniffing
it
reminds
me
i
need
to
clean
my
counter
tops
taste
is
sickeningly
sweet
with
a
sweet
fake
lemony
flavor
its
not
even
tart
and
acidic
just
sweet
pouring
the
rest
out
limited
release
good
not
a
badtasting
lemonlime
gah
im
getting
tired
of
writing
that
flavoured
germanstyle
lager
however
its
plainness
puts
it
up
against
the
full
fruity
beers
out
there
as
opposed
to
the
simple
halfandhalfs
of
the
proclaimed
style
nothing
really
worth
seeking
out
for
that
reason
and
instantly
forgettable
pours
a
golden
honey
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
when
sipped
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
of
hopsgrains
with
citrus
the
taste
is
the
same
with
some
floral
in
the
mix
as
well
and
ends
of
a
strange
tangy
finish
from
the
lemon
overall
it
was
just
ok
would
be
a
much
lower
rating
except
my
wife
liked
it
so
at
least
the
two
bottles
from
the
sam
adams
variety
pack
didnt
go
to
waste
lemonade
beer
is
definitely
not
my
thing
o
whenever
i
get
a
bottle
of
miller
or
inbev
massproduced
beer
i
typically
add
lemon
or
lime
juice
to
make
it
palatable
sa
porch
rocker
tastes
pretty
similar
and
goes
down
smooth
on
a
hot
day
not
offensivetasting
but
not
tasty
either
just
an
easydrinking
beer
that
reminds
me
of
light
beer
with
lemon
although
ive
never
understood
the
point
of
the
germans
taking
good
beer
and
diluting
it
with
lemonade
to
create
a
radler
o
a
bit
lacking
in
the
flavor
but
still
enough
to
keep
the
relaxation
in
motion
on
a
hot
summer
day
sit
back
and
drink
em
down
can
hold
up
enough
to
drink
a
couple
thought
this
would
be
a
great
beer
like
the
summer
ale
for
the
summer
everything
is
there
but
very
lack
luster
this
is
the
only
sam
adams
that
is
a
pour
and
drain
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
in
thinking
this
would
go
along
with
the
summer
ale
for
my
summer
beers
o
the
radler
style
doesnt
seem
to
be
very
popular
among
the
hardcore
beer
crowd
and
there
are
a
few
solid
arguments
i
could
see
supporting
that
but
when
a
brewer
is
after
a
blend
of
lemonade
and
beer
one
must
to
go
into
the
experience
expecting
what
the
brewer
is
after
not
something
else
with
that
said
samuel
adams
porch
rocker
is
a
near
flawless
example
of
a
radler
a
wellmade
beer
blended
with
lemonade
thats
neither
artificial
or
overpowering
its
crisp
and
refreshing
aroma
make
for
a
lively
smell
that
leads
right
into
a
light
kiss
of
lemonade
tartness
balanced
with
a
bright
and
malty
helles
lager
in
the
flavor
still
beerforward
its
hard
to
ask
for
a
more
refreshing
or
sublime
marriage
of
the
two
the
feel
if
the
beer
pretty
light
and
goes
down
easy
its
low
abv
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
if
you
enjoy
the
almost
candylike
flavor
that
is
the
driving
flavor
of
this
beer
overall
i
had
better
fruit
vegetable
beers
then
this
one
it
is
just
to
much
tart
lemon
lingering
for
my
taste
overall
i
came
into
this
brew
with
at
least
some
decent
expectations
considering
sam
adams
brewed
this
was
deeply
unimpressed
tired
of
that
word
already
however
on
the
finish
i
did
notice
some
hoppiness
flavors
i
would
not
recommend
to
a
friend
unless
they
enjoy
those
shandy
beers
then
youre
on
your
own
cheers
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
anyway
a
dang
good
beer
from
sam
adams
when
they
say
it
hits
the
spot
on
one
of
those
hot
summer
nights
plenty
here
in
fla
i
can
tell
you
it
does
about
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
was
its
smell
the
lemon
scent
didnt
quite
mix
well
with
the
hops
but
other
than
that
it
was
fantastic
i
was
particularly
impressed
on
the
taste
crisp
refreshing
just
the
right
hint
of
lemon
mixing
well
with
slight
ale
flavor
definitely
one
of
my
new
favs
for
sam
adams
it
has
a
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
of
foam
it
has
a
slight
lemonade
smell
to
it
it
has
very
slight
lemon
taste
to
it
and
is
not
over
powering
it
has
a
very
fizzy
mouth
feel
that
doesnt
really
linger
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
and
is
worth
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
aroma
ifs
one
dimensional
with
lots
of
lemon
and
weak
grains
flavor
follows
the
nose
lots
of
lemon
hint
of
citric
leafy
hop
light
and
smooth
crisp
flavor
and
finish
in
the
end
pretty
refreshing
a
solid
session
beer
or
for
a
hot
summers
day
o
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
will
only
appeal
to
most
on
hot
summer
days
which
is
what
it
was
intended
for
for
that
ill
probably
drink
a
few
this
summer
o
overally
a
soso
shandy
can
not
believe
the
summer
pack
is
already
out
overall
a
refreshing
beer
for
warm
weather
goes
down
easy
o
citrusy
flavors
are
ok
as
subtle
as
they
were
i
think
the
beer
would
be
better
if
they
were
taken
down
one
more
notch
pretty
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
the
flavor
is
more
lemon
soda
than
lager
with
a
light
lemonadelike
sweet
flavor
with
fizzy
sodalike
taste
with
mild
malt
flavor
in
the
background
with
a
slight
yeast
accent
that
accentuates
the
lemon
soda
sweetness
toward
the
end
giving
more
of
a
coolertype
flavor
this
was
not
enjoyable
as
i
expected
i
have
had
other
radler
type
beer
mixed
bottles
before
that
seemed
like
a
better
hybrid
than
this
i
prefer
something
with
more
beer
and
less
lemon
soda
in
the
taste
o
extremely
refreshing
a
little
too
sweet
if
you
arent
drinking
this
with
food
but
definitely
my
first
approved
summer
favorite
of
2014
overall
not
really
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
this
is
pretty
straightforward
stuff
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
strictly
as
a
beer
this
would
rate
lower
since
the
lemon
component
is
really
the
most
prominent
but
for
the
hybrid
sort
of
beverage
that
it
is
it
works
well
overall
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
pretty
decent
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
very
crisp
and
refreshing
its
pretty
adequate
and
id
gladly
drink
it
i
like
a
shandy
every
now
and
then
especially
in
warmer
weather
however
it
is
always
hard
to
rate
them
because
it
is
a
blend
the
appearance
was
a
nice
hazy
yellow
with
a
smell
of
a
lot
of
citrus
the
taste
is
a
pretty
standard
shandy
with
a
very
light
feel
to
it
if
its
a
hot
day
and
you
need
something
to
cool
yourself
off
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beverage
however
dont
go
into
this
thinking
that
youre
going
to
get
something
groundbreaking
definitely
a
nice
session
beer
refreshing
not
much
character
but
totally
refreshing
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
my
favorite
summertime
beer
not
quite
a
shandy
though
not
far
off
the
lemon
flavor
is
evident
and
i
like
how
at
least
to
this
point
they
havent
tried
to
do
too
much
to
it
no
other
fruit
or
spices
to
take
away
from
the
german
lemonaide
makes
it
very
enjoyable
it
is
just
an
excellent
refreshing
summertime
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
overall
this
is
beer
is
just
okay
i
just
find
this
beer
meh
nothing
in
the
beer
stands
out
ojust
a
bad
beer
maybe
if
shadys
are
your
thing
try
it
but
everything
seemed
to
be
off
on
this
one
this
is
a
decent
selection
and
might
be
a
nice
choice
to
introduce
a
nonbeer
drinker
to
craft
beer
or
at
least
microbrews
if
the
bbc
is
still
that
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
lemon
notes
with
lightly
sweet
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
lightly
sweet
lemon
notes
with
some
lightly
sweet
malt
notes
body
is
light
with
average
carbonation
bland
shandy
summary
this
is
technically
a
radler
its
inoffensive
but
very
lemony
this
is
really
like
5050
lemonadebeer
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
only
have
it
on
a
hot
summers
day
o
kickin
it
with
the
ladies
take
this
to
the
party
youll
earn
brownie
points
overall
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
good
on
a
105
degree
day
in
phoenix
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
concoction
not
my
favourite
style
wise
it
has
its
place
among
summer
quenchers
if
this
were
the
beach
it
might
be
a
different
story
i
could
see
it
being
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
sitting
in
my
house
its
a
bit
too
much
not
super
bad
just
not
really
my
thing
per
se
i
could
see
non
regular
beer
drinkers
really
liking
this
in
a
league
with
shock
topblue
moon
etc
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
aromas
of
light
grain
and
some
lemonlime
sodapop
taste
begins
with
big
lemonlime
flavor
followed
by
a
dry
cracker
malt
middle
and
a
lime
peel
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
light
overall
a
decent
tasting
beverage
at
first
but
it
gets
really
cloying
after
about
halfway
through
as
its
just
too
sweet
and
alcoholpop
tasting
o
fruit
beers
are
not
really
my
thing
this
one
turned
out
pretty
much
as
i
expected
tolerable
but
i
figure
i
may
as
well
just
buy
a
bag
of
lemonheads
at
first
i
thought
this
was
ok
but
as
it
warmed
it
got
bad
i
dont
want
one
of
these
again
thankfully
all
i
had
was
one
o
i
think
this
is
a
good
entry
beer
into
the
world
of
beer
a
nice
mix
of
lemonade
and
beer
might
help
get
non
beer
drinkers
into
drinking
beer
very
refreshing
lighter
beer
that
is
blended
well
with
lemonade
a
good
beer
for
the
style
o
if
nothing
else
this
would
kick
ass
on
a
hot
day
as
a
rule
of
thumb
though
i
dont
rate
beersomething
else
hybrids
or
malternatives
highly
this
being
no
exception
id
drink
it
over
commercial
ciders
bmc
or
the
like
in
this
weather
but
not
over
a
welldone
pure
lager
which
incidentally
sam
adams
has
a
few
of
overall
a
refreshing
summer
beer
although
the
sweetness
limits
drinkability
somewhat
i
would
get
it
again
though
porch
rocker
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
hint
of
lemon
citrus
like
note
but
smells
more
like
lemon
pledge
cleaning
wipes
the
taste
however
has
a
nice
crisp
malty
backbone
with
a
nice
strong
lemonade
like
aftertaste
nice
blend
of
beer
and
lemonade
like
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
overall
wow
a
very
good
refreshing
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
summers
day
d
shandies
radlers
etc
easily
my
least
favorite
style
at
least
this
one
has
a
decent
base
beer
beneath
it
pretty
much
a
lemonade
beer
not
much
else
going
on
but
thats
the
point
i
suppose
it
is
what
it
is
o
as
i
have
been
to
germany
i
would
not
consider
this
a
radler
this
comes
across
as
a
shandy
with
too
much
ginger
ale
not
bad
but
not
what
i
crave
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
an
ok
fruit
juice
beer
does
what
it
sets
out
to
be
a
hot
weather
thirst
quencher
more
lemon
soda
like
than
beer
but
its
a
decent
sodabeer
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
mainly
because
i
dont
like
shandys
that
being
said
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
im
assuming
that
its
a
pretty
good
example
of
what
a
shandy
is
supposed
to
taste
like
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
use
to
try
to
convert
those
bmc
drinkers
or
landshark
drinkers
or
corona
drinkers
to
american
craft
beer
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
lawnmower
beer
its
certainly
refreshing
enough
pours
a
light
golden
in
color
less
than
a
finger
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
nice
strong
lemon
citrus
aroma
with
a
bready
wheat
like
lemon
taste
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
that
ends
very
clean
its
90
degrees
today
and
this
beer
is
doing
the
job
very
well
12oz
bottle
best
before
november
served
in
pint
glass
crystal
clear
and
pale
yellow
with
small
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
and
a
vanishingly
small
white
head
marginal
aroma
flavor
is
lemonade
all
the
way
refreshing
and
natural
but
sweeter
that
it
should
and
with
absolutely
no
hint
that
this
is
a
radler
as
opposed
to
a
straight
up
hard
lemonade
gotta
disagree
with
jason
on
that
one
the
body
is
pretty
thin
and
as
a
result
its
hard
to
taste
anything
but
lemonade
here
but
its
refreshing
and
would
probably
be
quite
enjoyable
if
thats
all
you
were
looking
for
not
as
fun
as
kronenbourg
blanc
and
only
marginally
less
gimmicky
o
ive
had
quite
a
few
shandysradlers
though
regarded
as
a
fruit
vegetable
this
is
the
respectable
crisp
refreshing
hardly
tastes
like
a
beer
a
good
thing
or
bad
thing
its
all
up
to
the
consumer
a
refreshing
pool
side
tart
lemonade
quencher
that
will
make
satisify
the
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
without
being
weighed
down
the
beer
was
smooth
with
some
after
taste
of
mostly
lemon
but
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
have
again
i
prefer
the
summer
shandy
from
leinie
but
this
is
a
good
one
as
well
poured
from
a
bottle
interesting
beer
drank
first
half
ice
cold
and
was
not
very
impressed
the
beer
starts
to
taste
a
little
better
as
it
warms
up
though
not
too
carbonated
which
i
was
ok
with
it
has
obvious
lemon
flavors
that
are
somewhat
refreshing
in
the
summer
it
reminds
me
of
a
hard
lemonade
and
beer
hybrid
but
leans
more
towards
beer
it
is
worth
trying
but
i
think
cider
fans
will
appreciate
it
more
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
the
lemon
is
a
bit
artificial
tasting
the
sweetness
while
not
cloying
is
also
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
but
i
do
like
the
simplicity
of
the
beer
and
would
be
a
great
choice
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
in
its
defense
my
thirtyyearold
daughter
and
her
boyfriend
bought
a
twelvepack
and
claim
to
love
it
they
like
leinenkugel
summer
shandy
too

poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
strong
of
lemonade
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
lemons
a
touch
of
tartness
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
unique
beer
worth
trying
once
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
steady
diet
of
it
yellow
color
and
heavy
moderation
heavy
citrus
aroma
initially
tastes
like
carbonated
juice
or
soda
as
it
moves
over
the
palate
youre
hit
with
sweet
citrus
beer
really
refreshing
yet
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
can
be
overpowering
a
great
summer
beer
for
those
who
like
or
dont
mind
a
lot
of
carbonation
o
an
interesting
try
at
a
radler
but
not
worthy
imho
of
any
revisits
porch
rocker
is
a
lemon
accented
beer
and
it
ranks
as
one
of
the
least
bitter
brews
i
have
ever
tasted
it
certainly
has
some
redeeming
qualities
as
a
summer
beer
but
it
isnt
the
type
of
taste
i
go
for
on
a
regular
basis
i
might
try
it
again
when
the
heat
and
humidity
of
summer
are
at
a
peak
but
other
than
that
i
will
likely
pass
on
this
one
more
often
than
not
the
sweetness
and
taste
of
lemons
are
not
beer
qualities
i
want
in
an
everyday
beer
overall
a
refreshing
beer
i
could
really
only
have
a
couple
due
to
all
the
sweetness
that
this
beer
is
characteristic
of
beer
poured
this
12
oz
fruit
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
bright
clear
golden
color
produced
a
nice
white
head
and
lacing
that
stuck
to
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
squeezed
lemons
and
fresh
baked
bread
light
in
body
the
ale
had
a
foundation
of
light
fluffy
bread
lemon
and
i
mean
a
heavy
dose
of
lemon
very
tart
crisp
smooth
refreshing
one
of
the
best
summer
or
lawn
mower
beers
i
have
ever
sampled
i
will
have
to
pick
up
a
full
6
pack
of
this
absolutely
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
by
sam
adams
can
definitely
drink
this
all
day
every
day
taste
is
outstanding
and
the
aroma
is
overall
exceptional
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
sitting
on
your
porch
just
as
the
name
suggests
overall
a
perfect
beer
top
notch
panty
dropper
still
nothing
i
would
drink
more
than
12oz
of
in
any
given
24
hour
period
its
a
nice
beer
to
start
out
or
have
early
in
the
drinking
experience
couldnt
see
it
working
in
anything
below
60
degrees
outside
carbonation
good
beer
neither
too
light
or
too
heavy
id
say
my
score
goes
up
12
grade
on
this
beer
when
its
90
degrees
or
above
outside
rjt
the
taste
was
a
lot
like
drinking
recently
squeezed
lemon
juice
mashed
in
with
pale
malts
and
barley
i
guess
thats
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
taste
considering
the
style
this
will
find
a
definite
audience
because
it
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
and
humid
day
maybe
if
i
try
it
again
in
midjuly
when
its
90
degrees
i
might
appreciate
it
better
overall
its
tasty
but
isnt
fantastic
a
nice
light
addition
to
the
summer
12
pack
tho
ill
certainly
enjoy
the
other
bottle
as
well
as
this
one
overall
middle
of
the
road
not
a
total
wash
out
but
no
blazing
success
for
a
style
i
actually
enjoy
the
lemon
is
very
pleasant
at
first
but
wears
out
its
welcome
with
the
aftertaste
maybe
needs
to
be
dialed
back
just
a
touch
on
the
flavor
addition
or
spend
a
few
more
days
in
the
fridge
love
me
some
porch
rocker
reminds
of
a
shandy
i
picked
some
up
at
shoprite
wines
spirits
in
little
falls
for
9
99
a
six
pack
i
also
realized
you
can
get
locally
delivered
from
there
website
at
shopritewine
com
they
have
so
many
craft
beers
over
400
you
guys
should
check
it
out
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
and
an
average
example
of
the
style
this
beer
was
going
in
the
right
direction
till
i
got
to
the
sweetness
if
that
was
toned
down
some
i
think
this
beer
would
be
on
par
with
most
shandys
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
but
the
flavors
couldnt
hold
my
attention
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
the
flavors
dont
really
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
nice
and
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
it
really
needs
to
be
toned
down
in
this
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
i
would
rather
have
summer
shandy
since
it
isnt
so
sweet
i
would
recommend
this
to
shandy
lover
who
dont
mind
some
sweetness
with
a
shandy
all
in
all
i
wasnt
that
into
this
beer
there
was
just
to
much
sweetness
for
me
and
it
ended
up
being
too
overpowering
and
it
made
this
beer
drink
much
more
like
a
lemonade
than
an
actual
beer
i
appreciate
the
attempt
but
it
just
didnt
come
together
as
well
as
it
could
have
better
luck
next
time

d
this
is
an
alcoholic
soft
drink
that
said
it
isnt
really
a
beer
so
i
didnt
know
how
to
rate
it
the
beer
is
orange
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
aroma
brings
wheat
fruity
sugars
grain
lemons
the
flavor
brings
lemon
candies
fruity
pebbles
cereal
really
sweet
with
artificial
fruit
flavoring
like
a
wine
cooler
not
my
thing
o
all
in
all
this
was
alright
tasted
good
at
first
but
afterwards
the
ricola
feel
kicked
in
and
my
feelings
were
mixed
id
say
its
worth
a
try
not
horrible
and
i
could
defiantly
drink
more
id
save
for
when
i
have
a
cold
lol
avoid
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
appropriate
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
you
do
some
yard
work
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
since
its
so
light
not
filling
at
all
very
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
considering
what
its
intended
to
be
but
there
are
other
lawnmower
beers
i
would
pick
first
cheers
summer
beers
look
no
further
i
didnt
even
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
and
i
could
have
downed
a
bunch
in
a
sitting
had
i
had
that
many
around
maybe
some
wheat
would
have
livened
this
up
a
bit
but
for
now
this
is
worth
a
go
once
just
to
see
what
else
is
possible
in
the
vast
array
of
sam
adams
products
currently
on
the
shelf
not
likely
to
disappoint
as
long
as
your
expectations
arent
terribly
high
o
really
depends
on
the
situation
this
will
never
be
a
beer
ill
sip
when
im
in
the
mood
for
quality
strong
tasting
brew
but
on
a
hot
day
or
any
other
time
your
thirst
calls
for
a
beer
refreshment
i
can
see
myself
going
for
one
of
these
i
guess
to
summerize
this
beer
is
good
for
what
it
is
strong
lemon
aroma
through
and
through
light
malt
character
and
mild
hop
character
through
some
foam
with
a
more
simple
lemon
oilpledge
after
the
beer
settles
flavor
is
decent
and
not
quite
overwhelming
in
the
lemon
department
though
it
is
certainly
well
represented
and
more
notable
on
the
finish
decent
body
for
a
style
within
a
stlye
easy
drinking
and
perhaps
even
robust
for
a
lemon
shandy
given
the
abv
overall
a
bit
sweet
to
have
a
few
of
and
might
actually
do
well
over
ice
would
prefer
a
more
robust
carbonation
otherwise
cheers
it
should
be
good
for
summer
o
i
thought
this
would
be
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
it
is
decent
it
is
not
hitting
the
spot
as
id
hoped
it
would
its
above
average
beer
my
pour
created
several
fingers
of
french
vanillacolored
head
but
its
inherent
fizziness
led
to
relatively
low
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
like
liquid
sunshine
in
the
glass
nose
was
very
lemony
and
it
brought
a
slight
pucker
to
my
mouth
in
anticipation
the
mouthfeel
was
light
not
thin
but
more
towards
unobtrusive
and
the
taste
was
fully
lemonade
finish
was
semidry
and
completely
refreshing
i
know
that
sa
is
making
the
move
to
cans
and
if
they
were
to
can
this
beer
it
would
be
great
at
the
beach
this
taste
like
someone
poured
lemonade
into
a
slightly
above
average
helles
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
color
is
a
bright
gold
that
im
not
certain
should
exist
from
natural
elements
the
mouthfeel
is
mellow
as
expected
for
they
beer
type
but
doesnt
add
its
a
bit
sweet
and
the
fruit
is
a
little
overpowering
for
me
i
guess
o
good
but
slightly
misses
the
mark
of
its
intended
purpose
kinda
reminds
me
of
sprite
without
less
carbonation
the
odd
sweetness
dull
out
any
attempt
of
a
crisp
feel
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
it
mentions
a
radler
i
dont
think
it
is
but
it
is
a
lemony
lager
not
bad
if
you
want
a
basic
beer
with
lemon
flavor
pours
brilliant
gold
with
fast
fuzzy
bubbles
swirls
out
to
just
liquid
see
through
helles
nose
some
citrus
notes
crisp
lemon
tart
taste
that
fades
into
a
chalky
lager
really
smooth
half
lemonade
half
beer
all
the
way
but
real
good
refreshing
summer
beer

tastes
too
sweet
and
citrusy
overly
tangy
good
idea
but
either
reduce
the
lemon
or
add
some
hops
jim
cloying
aftertaste
more
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
than
expected
but
it
delivers
on
the
citrusy
lemon
promise
grainy
character
is
slightly
offputting
and
i
would
actually
like
the
lemon
character
to
linger
more
ah
i
dont
like
it
not
sure
if
this
is
supposed
to
compete
with
the
lagershandy
crap
produced
today
but
this
isnt
good
avoid
m
light
bodied
good
carbonation
very
smooth
a
lemony
beer
soda
which
it
is
supposed
to
be
its
tough
to
rate
just
due
to
the
style
this
is
not
a
real
style
on
this
site
the
lemony
flavor
is
very
enjoyable
but
it
really
doesnt
have
enough
beer
characteristics
i
guess
a
good
change
of
pace
beer
during
the
summer
an
unsung
hero
of
cinco
de
mayo
straight
from
the
bottle
with
this
surprisingly
refreshing
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
a
beer
with
natural
flavors
added
sounds
way
better
than
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
tart
crisp
a
crowd
pleaser
great
for
what
it
is
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
clear
golden
with
a
finger
length
white
head
and
an
enormous
amount
of
tiny
bubbles
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
lemon
and
some
malt
its
pretty
straightforward
the
taste
follows
the
nose
which
is
lemonade
meets
beer
theres
the
crisp
lemon
flavor
that
mingles
well
with
the
light
malt
profile
the
body
is
light
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
for
what
this
is
its
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
the
appearance
is
good
but
not
much
head
or
aroma
to
speak
of
i
bought
this
in
a
sampler
pack
but
its
definitely
worth
buying
on
its
own
scores
reflect
for
what
it
is
designed
to
be
personally
i
would
not
buy
this
if
you
are
not
fishing
with
the
girls
this
is
a
mancard
surrender
immediately
the
beer
has
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
snow
white
head
that
diminished
quickly
the
beer
had
a
fruity
aroma
that
reminded
me
of
peaches
the
beer
is
somewhat
sweet
and
lemony
with
a
fruit
loop
kind
of
finish
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
quite
refreshing
this
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
with
almost
no
aftertaste
and
would
be
nice
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
atmosphere
is
pretty
strong
giant
foamy
head
and
solid
head
nose
is
very
light
malt
and
lemon
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
very
light
flavor
with
a
bit
of
lemon
not
so
much
as
to
overwhelm
though
overall
this
is
decent
quaff
although
ive
never
been
a
real
radler
fan
kudos
to
boston
beer
for
making
a
valiant
attempt
at
a
drinkable
version
its
a
clear
utterly
clear
light
golden
color
the
head
quickly
disappears
and
long
chains
of
bubbles
rush
up
through
the
brew
the
smell
is
notable
even
from
a
distance
huge
lemon
scents
it
smells
more
like
a
lemon
soda
than
a
beer
if
you
hunt
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
underneath
but
but
not
a
lot
the
taste
is
similar
very
reminiscent
of
lemon
soda
with
a
little
hop
finish
interesting
not
bad
but
not
quite
beer
either
its
got
huge
flavor
lots
of
lemon
some
grass
and
grain
hops
in
the
midtaste
through
the
finish
and
a
little
malt
underneath
interesting
but
not
my
style
light
in
body
i
bet
this
would
be
a
thirst
quencher
if
it
were
90
degrees
and
sunny
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
pale
straw
with
white
long
lasting
tall
head
and
soda
like
carbonation
some
lacing
body
is
medium
and
crisp
taste
is
lemonade
and
pale
malt
finish
is
short
and
unremarkable
this
brew
does
not
resemble
beer
easy
to
drink
refreshing
good
for
what
it
is
i
would
never
buy
a
sixer
of
this
though
i
prefer
my
beer
to
taste
like
beer
this
beer
has
a
very
light
color
and
a
light
taste
that
gives
you
a
feel
of
taking
another
sip
before
you
even
finish
the
sip
you
just
took
i
really
like
the
fragrance
of
this
beer
it
hits
you
as
your
nose
enters
the
mug
as
you
tip
to
sip
i
get
a
nice
citrus
flaver
in
my
mouth
after
each
and
every
sip
i
take
love
it
d
its
enjoyable
but
id
prefer
to
mix
my
own
radler
and
make
it
as
beer
heavy
as
i
prefer
i
also
typically
mix
radlers
using
american
wheat
beers
needs
more
lemon
or
less
as
i
see
it
sa
could
have
gone
two
ways
with
this
a
great
helles
with
a
mild
hint
of
lemon
or
a
lighter
beer
bursting
with
lemon
they
took
the
middle
and
the
beer
and
the
lemon
compete
rather
than
merge
a
good
experience
from
a
style
i
typically
have
bad
experiences
with
recommended
for
all
you
radlerlovers
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
type
definitely
different
and
definitely
good
for
summer
overall
meh
tastes
like
someone
spiked
my
beer
with
sprite
in
a
way
its
kinda
what
they
did
waaaay
too
sweet
think
bud
light
lime
with
stronger
beer
character
and
youve
got
a
general
idea
of
what
this
beer
is
all
about
not
a
fan
im
really
digging
this
one
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
its
tough
to
pull
off
a
beer
like
this
that
isnt
one
dimensional
and
unbalanced
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
a
perfect
beach
beer
and
because
of
the
lower
alcohol
something
that
wont
ruin
your
day
as
you
enjoy
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
doesnt
pack
any
spectacular
punches
but
it
is
rather
refreshing
the
smell
and
taste
both
compliment
the
same
citrusy
lemon
effect
i
think
this
would
be
best
enjoyed
served
quite
cold
on
a
very
hot
day
give
this
to
a
nonbeer
drinker
as
i
did
she
said
this
doesnt
taste
like
beer
at
all
i
would
possibly
get
this
again
overall
not
bad
tasting
but
not
what
i
would
call
a
beer
if
i
was
blindfolded
a
given
this
i
would
never
guess
this
was
a
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
hard
lemonade
overall
more
soft
drink
than
beer
not
a
favorite
it
has
been
years
since
i
had
a
lemonflavored
snapple
but
after
one
gulp
of
this
it
was
like
i
had
one
yesterday
lemon
iced
tea
is
the
main
flavor
though
apparently
there
is
some
beer
here
the
citrus
flavor
is
not
unpleasant
just
too
much
of
a
good
thing
lemon
peel
aftertaste
with
some
bitterness
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
ralphs
supermarket
in
san
clemente
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
sticks
around
a
little
while
there
is
a
lot
of
activity
has
a
pretty
solid
smell
my
olfactory
is
always
messed
up
so
take
it
at
your
own
risks
but
a
subtle
lemon
crisp
scent
is
there
man
this
beer
is
still
active
as
i
type
this
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
smooth
but
no
necessarily
in
a
great
way
the
taste
is
maybe
just
a
little
to
fruity
for
my
taste
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
little
crisper
and
a
bit
more
subtle
the
bottle
says
the
inspiration
was
from
german
cyclists
who
mixed
beer
and
tart
sparkling
lemonade
this
porch
rocker
was
inspired
by
that
i
wish
it
would
have
been
crisper
a
bit
more
tart
that
would
have
added
a
little
more
substance
to
it
c
poured
out
as
a
yellow
golden
color
very
clear
looking
with
a
white
head
on
top
thin
retention
on
top
and
a
light
lacing
the
smell
has
plenty
of
lemon
on
the
nose
definitely
smells
like
a
shandy
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
has
plenty
of
lemon
flavors
in
there
the
malts
are
hidden
in
this
beer
you
cant
get
too
much
from
them
the
mouthfeel
of
it
was
decent
lighter
bodied
nice
carbonation
overall
this
needs
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
for
sure
i
think
this
beer
will
be
much
better
on
a
hot
day
o
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
perfect
for
drinking
outside
on
the
beach
or
on
the
boat
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
o
2
75
this
is
a
high
for
style
abv
radler
with
i
think
more
lemon
flavor
than
average
i
feel
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
with
lemon
flavor
that
seems
too
artificial
in
addition
it
lacks
sufficient
balance
from
hops
beer
is
light
and
watery
on
the
palate
aftertaste
though
too
sweet
too
much
like
refined
sugar
and
lemons
odd
beer
although
not
as
bad
as
some
ive
had
in
the
past

overall
one
of
those
it
is
what
it
is
beers
not
bad
for
the
type
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
had
and
as
advertised
a
good
summer
drink
low
alchol
and
palatestripping
clean
taste
make
for
a
decent
drink
the
pour
is
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
definite
lemon
on
the
nose
with
a
strong
sweetness
light
tartness
so
sweet
bready
malt
and
a
very
light
floral
hop
aroma
very
fresh
lemon
note
to
this
the
taste
is
actually
very
lemonade
like
sweet
and
sour
flavors
with
some
hints
of
grass
light
bread
and
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
ever
so
slight
biscuit
malt
notes
too
overall
its
hard
to
grade
this
its
just
kind
of
a
unique
beer
if
youre
the
sort
of
person
who
cant
get
enough
lemon
youll
be
in
heaven
if
you
like
your
beer
to
just
be
you
know
beer
it
might
not
be
for
you
overall
drinkability
ive
not
had
a
true
radler
before
so
its
hard
for
me
to
rate
it
according
to
that
style
so
let
me
comment
on
it
as
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
lemon
in
it
it
works
for
about
half
a
glass
and
then
it
kind
of
loses
its
charm
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
hotter
or
i
was
outside
enjoying
this
inside
and
after
a
meal
its
just
okay
and
not
that
drinkable
one
is
enough
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
and
lots
of
lemon
lemon
juice
and
lemonade
aromas
taste
is
of
maltgrain
yeast
and
lemonade
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
mainly
for
the
fact
that
its
crisp
and
refreshing
even
if
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
not
all
that
exciting
o
tolerable
especially
if
its
super
cold
and
its
very
hot
out
otherwise
i
would
steer
clear
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
sudsy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
aromas
of
fresh
lemon
crisp
grain
and
slightly
doughy
malt
very
crisp
and
fresh
taste
is
similarly
lemonforward
nice
and
fresh
with
more
light
grainy
malt
and
clean
yeast
lemon
flavor
is
nice
and
authentic
not
sweet
and
fake
like
other
shandys
on
the
market
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
thin
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
welcomed
addition
to
the
sam
adams
lineup
hopefully
this
will
be
out
again
next
summer
this
is
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
that
samuel
adams
has
brewed
i
have
tasted
this
kind
of
beer
before
but
i
cant
remeber
which
brewery
maybe
magic
hat
either
way
very
fruity
some
spice
definitely
a
summer
beer
just
ok
for
me
o
this
isnt
a
true
radler
there
isnt
any
lemonade
in
it
its
a
lager
with
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
and
lemon
flavoring
however
i
would
say
that
i
enjoy
this
more
than
say
leines
summer
shandy
theres
a
bit
more
depth
and
complexity
here
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
found
myself
a
new
favorite
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
cap
some
lingering
foam
scant
lacing
big
lemony
aroma
zesty
with
notes
of
less
harsh
citrus
a
bit
of
tangerine
sweetness
perhaps
slightly
peppery
with
slight
wheat
sourness
lemonade
character
really
overpowers
the
flavour
but
its
tasty
and
refreshing
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
bitterness
was
lowish
up
front
but
lingered
and
there
was
a
hint
of
white
pepper
in
the
finish
mild
maltiness
throughout
and
wheat
character
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
slightly
sticky
and
sweet
texture
overall
it
was
interesting
but
not
something
im
likely
to
go
back
to
overall
almost
like
they
took
a
watered
down
boston
lager
and
spiced
it
with
a
bunch
of
lemonade
some
of
the
taste
is
full
out
lemon
sugar
drink
but
there
is
easily
enough
beer
in
there
i
could
have
several
in
a
row
but
could
not
see
myself
stocking
this
as
an
everyday
beer
super
drinkable
not
thirsty
for
another
one
but
it
was
pretty
refreshing
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
smooth
whit
head
that
quickly
minimized
to
a
thin
layer
smell
is
lemony
and
sweet
and
that
mainly
dominates
the
nose
the
beer
tastes
slightly
tangy
and
sweet
its
lemony
and
the
malty
profile
kicks
in
second
with
some
bread
and
a
hint
of
caramel
it
has
a
medium
body
not
as
light
as
i
thought
it
would
be
there
is
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
a
very
good
summer
beer
o
guess
the
boston
beer
company
wants
a
piece
of
the
radlershandy
pie
theyre
going
to
have
to
do
better
than
this
if
they
want
to
compete
with
miller
and
ab
really
a
lackluster
attempt
im
not
much
for
shandystyle
beers
its
usually
the
artificial
syrupy
qualities
that
throw
me
off
this
one
is
better
in
that
department
but
its
still
noticeable
it
does
exactly
what
it
advertises
its
a
light
bodied
lager
with
a
distinct
lemonade
flavor
throughout
ill
pass
in
the
future
but
anyone
enjoying
this
style
should
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
the
lemony
taste
drink
the
summer
ale
the
summer
ale
this
year
i
have
found
to
be
particularly
refreshing
the
porch
rocker
just
didnt
cut
it
for
me
thin
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
i
think
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
drink
for
a
first
time
initiate
to
beer
but
to
serious
drinker
this
is
a
clearly
overly
sweet
offering
its
still
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
very
solid
summer
beer
pretty
smart
on
mr
kochs
part
to
introduce
this
for
the
season
especially
after
the
disappointment
that
is
the
summer
ale
overall
a
decent
summer
offering
seems
like
sam
adams
is
really
pushing
the
lemon
zest
in
alot
of
their
beers
lately
time
to
stop
refreshing
beer
that
is
just
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
good
for
summer
time
and
one
of
the
better
shandy
styles
i
have
encountered
overall
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
bud
light
lime
its
better
though
but
not
by
much
its
drinkable
but
not
something
id
buy
again
its
probably
good
for
the
style
not
much
depth
and
does
not
pop
like
a
radler
does
obviously
due
to
this
being
pretty
much
a
full
on
beer
perhaps
if
the
body
with
lightened
up
a
bit
and
a
crisper
carbonation
this
would
be
great
im
reviewing
this
based
on
what
its
aiming
to
be
a
summer
thirst
quencher
this
would
be
a
giant
f
if
i
were
to
rate
this
as
a
beer
but
as
a
refreshing
beverage
it
seemed
to
have
accomplished
its
objective
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
simple
and
not
really
a
beer
more
of
a
mike
hard
watever
variety
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
nice
pale
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
for
me
of
grass
and
lemons
taste
was
good
for
a
lemonade
but
this
is
beer
if
i
want
lemon
id
buy
a
mikes
for
a
beer
this
didnt
do
it
for
me
and
i
dont
even
understand
the
point
of
brewing
this
the
mouthfeel
though
was
pleasant
and
as
a
drink
in
the
summer
i
did
like
it
i
however
am
reviewing
this
as
a
beer
i
think
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
november
2012
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
aroma
is
mostly
lemon
peel
and
lemon
candy
like
lemonheads
along
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
but
its
mainly
an
artificial
lemon
aroma
not
that
it
smells
bad
at
all
the
brew
tastes
like
slightly
sour
lemon
candy
and
theres
also
some
sugar
substitute
noticeable
tastes
a
little
worse
the
longer
i
drink
it
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
easy
enough
to
drink
i
guess
mostly
average
overall
i
only
tried
this
because
one
of
my
friends
gave
me
a
couple
bottles
i
wouldnt
pay
for
this
brew
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
either
i
really
enjoy
these
beverages
but
on
a
completely
different
level
than
beer
this
sam
adams
version
is
perhaps
less
sweet
and
slightly
more
beerlike
than
most
but
its
still
a
beer
coctail
and
likely
deserves
separate
criteria
overall
not
bad
but
id
rather
have
a
leinies
overall
i
thought
this
beer
would
help
sam
adams
replace
coastal
wheat
but
that
beer
is
better
this
reminds
me
of
bud
light
lime
same
soap
taste
overall
another
disappointing
2012
seasonal
from
samuel
adams
this
year
to
be
honest
i
loved
the
seasonals
right
up
until
last
years
oktoberfest
im
not
sure
what
happened
whether
to
blame
a
tastechange
or
the
brewery
but
each
samuel
adams
i
try
is
filled
with
an
unbalanced
mixture
of
hops
and
malt
the
lemon
in
this
tastes
very
unnatural
i
was
disappointed
with
the
whitewater
ipa
this
year
as
well
and
noble
pils
hasnt
tasted
the
same
to
me
either
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
again
it
sits
low
in
the
fruitvegetable
beer
category
and
i
would
much
rather
drink
a
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
when
it
comes
to
a
refreshing
summer
drink
spiced
with
lemon
tasteoverall
lemonade
meets
lager
with
some
saccharine
stirred
in
for
sweetness
now
granted
i
know
this
doesnt
sound
all
that
exciting
but
for
what
the
beer
is
it
works
i
would
be
more
than
happy
so
spend
four
hours
on
a
hot
saturday
afternoon
mowing
a
lawn
just
so
long
as
i
had
a
six
pack
of
this
to
plow
through
o
again
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
serves
as
a
nice
alternate
to
leinie
summer
shandy
or
even
to
corona
at
a
cookout
the
feel
is
as
advertised
effervescent
i
expect
this
beer
to
be
light
which
it
is
and
crisp
which
it
is
but
it
gets
too
filling
and
is
a
little
difficult
to
swallow
with
all
that
effervescence
it
tones
down
a
little
pat
of
the
way
through
and
gets
smooth
but
it
also
thins
a
little
at
that
point
drinkability
is
nice
on
a
balanced
beer
other
radlers
are
dominated
by
lemon
tastes
porch
rocker
has
a
wheat
base
that
balances
the
refreshing
lemon
very
well
this
is
a
limited
beer
and
i
would
grab
it
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
flavor
is
wellbalanced
with
the
lemon
being
not
so
forward
as
in
other
similar
brews
ive
had
enjoyable
overall
it
drinks
much
better
than
their
summer
ale
might
consider
getting
a
six
next
time
i
am
at
the
shop
overall
bleh
fake
tasting
beer
that
i
would
expect
from
a
macro
company
not
sam
adams
but
then
again
this
is
probably
more
to
get
the
ladies
from
leinenkugel
to
switch
to
this
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
side
note
i
think
this
should
be
a
different
style
in
itself
with
all
the
different
ones
coming
out
on
the
market
its
difficult
to
rate
it
as
strictly
a
fruit
beer
but
thats
just
my
opinion
overall
more
or
less
a
radler
with
a
more
american
ale
feel
good
lemonade
flavor
with
a
beer
pretty
tasty
samuel
adams
delivers
another
decent
summer
option
pours
a
pale
helles
like
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
this
one
seems
to
do
the
style
justice
even
talking
visually
by
itself
aroma
has
citrus
zest
pale
biscuit
malts
really
smells
like
lemonade
but
theres
still
a
beer
in
there
somewhere
flavor
speaks
better
of
the
actual
beer
brewed
here
refreshing
hints
of
lemon
zest
with
quality
biscuit
toasted
malts
and
mild
light
herbal
hops
in
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
to
strong
carbonation
flowing
forth
a
bit
of
bitter
zest
left
behind
on
the
palate
but
nothing
too
sweet
or
cloying
in
this
beer
overall
a
quality
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
bubbly
drinking
summer
beer
blended
with
lemonade
overall
it
is
refreshing
but
not
something
i
am
typically
looking
for
in
a
beer
it
is
much
better
then
something
like
a
mikes
hard
lemonade
so
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
of
that
like
take
this
instead
o
was
expecting
more
flavor
got
a
pretty
flatline
taste
drinkable
beer
however
just
not
very
bam
to
the
point
where
it
stands
out
vs
the
competiton
only
way
id
try
it
again
would
maybe
be
if
it
was
on
draught
ever
if
you
are
looking
for
a
crisp
refreshing
summer
beer
on
a
warm
day
this
one
certainly
hits
the
spot
well
i
could
see
myself
with
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
saturday
afternoon
after
a
grass
cutting
session
definately
recommend
for
a
summer
beer
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
lemon
with
some
wheat
notes
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
similar
this
tastes
more
like
lemonade
than
it
does
a
beer
but
there
is
a
little
bit
of
wheat
and
biscuit
malt
to
make
it
somewhat
beer
like
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
much
to
like
here
but
i
guess
it
tastes
about
like
what
the
brewery
was
going
for
the
beer
is
pretty
decent
but
has
some
off
flavors
on
the
finish
of
bandaids
and
wet
cardboard
but
their
faint
and
dont
take
away
from
the
beer
too
much
in
my
opinion
much
more
drinkable
than
other
fruit
beers
sam
adams
has
allowed
the
fruit
to
still
be
the
star
without
overpowering
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
for
what
it
is
pretty
refreshing
and
well
brewed
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
golden
yellow
body
with
a
quick
dissolving
head
that
leaves
nothing
the
smell
is
of
fresh
lemons
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
tart
of
lemon
and
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
the
mouth
feel
is
great
and
overall
a
really
good
summer
beer
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
still
not
as
good
as
its
geman
counterparts
but
a
good
effort
by
the
boys
in
boston
overall
i
like
it
its
very
different
and
good
for
what
it
is
way
better
than
shock
tops
and
even
better
than
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
i
like
it
cant
say
that
id
rate
it
very
high
but
if
you
must
sample
this
style
go
with
this
over
the
saranac
example
of
course
im
expecting
the
shock
top
example
to
fall
flat
radler
shandy
call
it
what
you
want
tastelemon
zesthoney
very
lightbodied
becomes
a
bit
cloying
upon
warming
best
served
wellchilled
very
shandylike
not
great
by
any
means
but
kudos
to
s
a
for
putting
different
style
out
there
surprised
to
get
this
when
i
did
today
and
im
a
bit
skeptical
about
it
despite
my
love
of
radlers
damn
you
time
in
germany
givin
it
the
ol
college
try
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
shortlived
fizzy
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
peel
light
cardamom
and
what
may
or
may
not
be
cracked
wheat
the
taste
leads
off
with
a
stark
and
somewhat
artificial
lemon
flavor
followed
quickly
by
a
somewhat
wheaty
apparition
that
intertwines
with
the
lemon
for
the
duration
the
two
toning
each
other
down
a
bit
whilst
working
their
conjoined
way
down
the
gullet
its
not
necessarily
bad
but
not
something
that
stands
out
as
being
particularly
tasty
either
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
bordering
on
fizzier
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
an
okay
neoradler
at
best
something
i
wouldnt
purposefully
reach
for
again
but
also
something
i
wouldnt
really
spurn
if
offered
to
me
in
passing
very
syrupy
one
of
sam
adams
worst
brew
in
my
opinion
not
a
big
blueberry
fan
and
it
is
also
artificial
tasting
for
sure
a
good
summer
flavor
clean
and
easy
drinking
lager
a
nice
crisp
lager
where
the
blueberries
shine
on
the
finish
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
clean
and
it
delivers
plenty
of
blueberry
taste
i
would
pick
this
up
again
nice
and
refreshing
real
nice
tart
yet
not
too
sweet
blueberry
taste
really
is
rather
weak
and
watery
however
actually
really
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
summers
day
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
another
fine
brew
by
sam
adams
and
my
very
first
blueberry
beer
this
stuff
is
fantastic
the
blueberry
isnt
too
overpowering
everything
meshes
together
nicely
highly
drinkable

strong

light
tart
surrounded
by
bready

that
becomes

very
fruity
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
recently
overall
this
is
the
first
blueberry
beer
ive
had
it
has
a
mild
blueberry
flavor
still
a
beer
taste
though
a
good
summer
beer
fairly
good
even
with
fruit
taste
i
couldnt
finish
this
beer
ended
up
pouring
it
out
as
the
blueberry
mixed
with
hoppy
bitterness
left
me
highly
disappointed
it
had
quite
the
unpleasant
after
taste
and
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
selection
i
have
to
say
i
did
not
expect
to
like
this
beer
my
experience
with
fruity
beers
had
not
been
positive
but
this
beer
was
quite
pleasant
especially
for
a
summer
beer
this
is
refreshing
and
light
in
smell
the
blueberries
come
out
overwhelmingly
but
in
taste
the
blueberry
notes
are
far
more
subtle
likely
not
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
interested
in
trying
fruit
beers
single
bottle
from
a
summer
mixed
pack
poured
into
a
flute
color
is
a
hazy
orangeyellow
amber
topped
by
a
moderate
amount
of
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
rather
unassuming
and
perhaps
bland
generic
pale
malt
a
little
husky
a
whiff
of
grassy
and
haylike
noble
hops
and
of
course
the
expected
blueberry
although
this
is
subtle
on
the
palate
the
latter
comes
across
like
a
sweet
jam
rather
than
fresh
fruit
which
is
ok
in
my
book
although
the
fruit
effect
does
precious
little
to
temper
what
i
feel
are
some
pretty
astringent
grainy
notes
in
the
background
as
advertised
a
little
citrus
emerges
lemon
highly
carbonated
and
on
the
thin
side
with
a
finish
that
is
a
tad
medicinal
grass
and
bitter
green
fruit
finish
might
be
a
strong
suit
here
id
say
the
merit
here
is
in
the
fruit
being
tastefully
executed
and
the
usual
sam
adams
expertise
with
noble
hopping
on
the
minus
side
of
the
ledger
i
am
not
feeling
the
malts
the
grainy
metallic
note
described
earlier
sticks
out
like
a
sore
thumb
not
an
essential
offering
from
this
brewery
overall
this
is
the
first
blueberry
beer
ive
had
it
was
different
and
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
i
will
probably
not
seek
this
out
again
samuel
adams
blueberry
hill
lager
brewed
by
boston
beer
company
with
an
abv
of
5
5
this
brew
pours
out
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
blueberry
hill
lager
is
a
unfiltered
brew
you
can
not
see
thought
it
the
smell
is
sweet
with
blueberries
and
a
hit
of
grains
this
brew
is
different
from
most
brews
on
the
market
as
far
as
the
smell
it
is
not
bad
it
is
just
different
the
taste
is
mild
with
blueberries
and
that
is
about
it
there
is
not
much
to
the
taste
of
this
brew
this
brew
does
go
down
smooth
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
also
refreshing
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
has
an
ok
balanace
to
it
i
was
hoping
for
more
in
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
solid
4
out
5
do
not
come
to
this
expecting
boston
lager
in
a
fiftyfifty
mix
with
blueberry
juice
there
is
a
lot
less
malt
a
whole
lot
less
hops
and
the
blueberries
are
well
balanced
its
a
nice
summer
quaffer
but
not
something
id
load
up
on
a
great
fruit
lager
but
appears
to
only
be
seasonal
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
a
sam
adams
blueberry
style
brew
my
expectations
did
not
quite
meet
reality
however
this
is
still
a
good
beer
to
have
during
the
warmer
months
i
poured
this
brew
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
first
impression
was
awesome
a
great
murky
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
was
definitely
blueberry
i
thought
the
overall
taste
was
a
little
lacking
i
would
prefer
a
stronger
blueberry
flavor
vice
a
hint
of
the
berry
that
this
brew
delivers
o
funny
thing
is
that
im
not
a
huge
blueberry
fan
the
berry
taste
does
not
dominate
and
is
light
refreshing
i
much
prefer
it
over
sams
cheery
wheat
cheers
this
is
rather
a
limpid
pale
gold
beer
that
developed
almost
no
head
at
all
the
nose
is
what
i
expect
from
such
things
frankenberry
cereal
basically
the
flavor
as
well
sickeningly
sweet
berryish
beer
with
no
other
flavors
this
is
very
badly
made
berry
beer
ever
way
too
sweet
to
finish
o
i
like
how
the
hops
add
lemon
and
citrus
so
this
beer
isnt
overdone
with
blueberry
it
is
more
enjoyable
than
i
thought
while
celebrating
the
u
s
of
a
declaring
its
independence
nothing
particularly
complex
but
hey
nothing
off
or
pandering
about
this
offering
either
for
that
matter
if
you
like
blueberries
and
a
swinging
to
and
fro
sweetness
then
this
one
might
be
for
you
me
i
can
appreciate
the
fruitiness
and
the
attempt
at
balance
here
so
i
will
certainly
pop
the
other
one
of
these
from
the
mixed
pack
on
my
sunny
deck
in
the
coming
weeks
purchased
today
part
of
a
variety
12pack
best
before
october
2014
served
from
bottle
into
a
14
oz
sea
dog
brewing
blueberry
wheat
ale
glass
cheers
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
if
i
had
to
drink
a
blueberry
beer
it
would
probably
be
this
one
the
feel
is
light
with
a
great
drinkable
feel
and
makes
for
a
good
summer
drinker
the
crisp
body
carries
some
of
the
sweetness
along
and
keeps
things
interesting
sam
adams
blueberry
hill
lager
not
their
best
fruit
beer
but
good
nonetheless
out
of
the
bottle
is
has
a
surprisingly
hazy
hue
to
it
you
can
see
the
carbonation
and
it
pours
a
thick
white
head
that
has
nice
staying
power
and
lacing
the
odor
emitted
is
simply
awesome
a
nice
mixture
of
blueberries
oranges
and
hops
that
mixes
oh
so
well
in
your
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
mostly
disappointing
too
much
aftertaste
for
my
liking
tastewise
it
was
pretty
good
the
blueberries
dont
quite
mix
as
well
with
the
citrus
as
the
bottle
tries
to
lead
you
to
believe
but
its
not
altogether
too
bad
overall
its
almost
outstanding
but
certainly
very
good
a
curiosity
i
wanted
to
try
from
the
summer
variety
pack
i
thought
this
was
quite
good
the
appearance
was
a
very
hazy
yellow
almost
amber
with
a
white
hail
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
was
all
blueberries
i
was
a
bit
worried
before
my
first
taste
but
my
worry
was
quickly
gone
the
blueberries
added
a
nice
layer
on
top
of
the
lager
that
i
thought
made
for
a
nice
sweet
beer
for
the
hot
day
it
was
very
thin
for
the
sweet
flavors
but
a
great
beer
to
mow
your
lawn
with
overall
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
the
hops
and
the
blueberries
work
together
well
in
this
lager
great
relaxing
beer
when
the
yard
is
finished
o
a
super
drinkable
fruit
beer
that
is
great
for
summer
the
blueberries
taste
pretty
authentic
as
well
well
done
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
weak
flat
head
nose
is
of
articficial
and
natural
blueberries
grassy
hops
and
12grain
bread
blueberry
flavor
is
soft
without
being
muted
allowing
the
pilsnerlike
qualities
to
really
shine
through
this
kind
of
tastes
like
a
bohemia
with
a
couple
of
blueberries
and
a
squirt
of
koolaid
in
the
pint
tasty
not
overwhelming
and
mild
enough
to
have
you
ordering
one
again
in
the
future
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
long
neck
bottle
with
raised
lettering
and
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
i
love
this
beer
its
different
delicious
and
satisfying
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
be
happy
i
love
the
carbonation
feel
in
my
mouth
this
beer
is
good
for
any
occasion
whether
it
be
mowing
or
partying
overall
pretty
straightforward
stuff
not
complex
and
nothing
spectacular
by
any
means
but
its
refreshing
and
tasty
enough
for
what
it
is

love
this
beer
to
death
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
beer
in
the
variety
pack
great
blueberry
beer
one
of
the
best
blueberry
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
anywhere
all
day
long
tastes
so
addictive
blueberries
blueberries
blueberies
what
more
can
i
say
o
this
beer
is
ok
i
have
to
say
that
the
women
who
dont
really
like
the
smell
of
beer
in
general
seem
to
enjoy
the
smell
of
this
beer
for
that
i
have
to
give
it
a
little
higher
rating
overall
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
gravitate
toward
but
it
is
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
light
yellow
color
lager
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
fake
blueberry
syrup
with
overly
sweet
malt
base
taste
is
also
dominated
by
this
fake
blueberry
syrup
with
overly
sweet
aftertaste
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
this
one
is
a
bit
disappointing
coming
from
sam
adams
oif
there
was
something
in
the
finish
the
beer
would
be
greatly
improved
but
right
now
it
is
just
some
semiartificial
blueberries
i
do
not
care
for
this
beer
at
all
it
reminds
me
of
orange
juice
after
brushing
your
teeththat
awful
taste
not
enjoyable
o
well
its
just
like
the
name
suggests
a
decent
lager
with
huge
blueberry
aroma
and
taste
with
the
standard
corn
finish
i
could
kick
a
few
of
these
back
and
i
suspect
it
would
go
well
with
breakfast
waffles
pancakes
pastries
etc
overall
i
am
by
no
means
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
isnt
too
bad
its
refreshing
in
a
way
and
has
a
nice
appearance
in
the
glass
worth
it
to
try
once
i
guess
overall
this
is
better
than
what
i
expected
it
is
sweet
but
not
so
much
that
a
2nd
maybe
in
order
would
make
a
better
dessert
beer
than
lawnmower
brew
eric
o
its
a
grainy
beer
with
blueberry
flavornothing
special
honestly
i
wouldnt
have
looked
for
this
beer
in
the
first
place
but
since
it
came
in
the
summer
sampler
i
gave
it
a
go
overall
not
undrinkable
and
not
terrible
still
wouldnt
look
for
this
beer
outside
of
the
sampler
and
probably
wont
want
another
one
mediocre
another
hohum
fruit
beer
the
blueberry
flavor
isnt
bad
overall
like
so
many
soldiers
in
so
many
battles
in
so
many
wars
we
are
going
to
take
that
hill
blueberry
hill
as
it
seems
like
exactly
the
alpine
spring
with
blueberry
flavoring
i
would
have
the
same
main
qualm
which
is
it
needs
a
bit
more
crispness
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
overall
a
good
summer
fruit
beer
with
hints
of
tartness
and
bitterness
and
not
overly
sweet
great
drinkability
o
another
good
entry
beer
for
people
who
do
not
drink
beer
often
i
feel
this
beer
has
a
strong
fruit
base
that
would
help
transition
people
into
the
craft
beer
movement
very
good
blueberry
aroma
and
taste
that
the
beer
blends
well
with
highlighting
the
blueberry
flavor
above
all
other
flavors
o
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
at
all
and
i
tend
to
be
a
bit
wary
of
the
fruit
beers
samuel
adams
produces
it
isnt
deep
complex
or
terribly
exciting
but
blueberry
hill
lager
definitely
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
i
definitely
would
not
turn
this
down
and
would
probably
seek
it
out
again
overall
an
ok
brew
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
in
a
six
pack
im
not
against
fruit
beers
i
love
the
cherry
wheat
and
im
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
but
i
dont
think
all
fruit
should
be
used
in
beer
d
too
bad
for
the
subpar
flavor
this
beer
had
a
lot
going
for
it
everything
else
hit
the
spot
though
as
far
as
the
sam
adams
beers
of
summer
variety
pack
goes
this
is
surprisingly
a
stand
out
hit
not
a
great
beer
but
at
least
it
delivers
what
it
promises
not
much
to
write
about
fairly
bland
for
a
fruit
beer
or
other
blueberry
beers
on
the
market
overall
a
pretty
decent
fruit
beer
nice
blueberry
flavor
and
honey
notes
that
avoid
becoming
too
sweet
o
i
find
this
blueberry
beer
to
be
better
than
most
fruity
beers
ive
tried
but
certainly
not
the
best
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
complain
if
it
was
available
the
blueberry
flavor
is
nice
im
glad
it
is
a
bit
more
subtle
than
a
shock
top
but
it
still
tastes
a
bit
artificial
for
my
preference
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
fruity
without
being
overpowering
and
nicely
balanced
with
the
bready
flavors
of
beer
it
makes
a
great
summer
beer
overall
although
im
not
sure
what
natural
flavor
added
means
this
fruit
beer
wasnt
bad
and
smooth
lager
finish
means
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
ok
mouthfeel
nothing
substantial
to
report
flavor
and
aroma
stays
with
the
beer
easy
to
drink
orange
in
color
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
one
of
the
worst
blueberry
beers
i
have
ever
had
but
that
isnt
exactly
a
bad
thing
it
is
not
super
sweet
like
others
and
the
blueberry
flavor
is
pretty
mild
it
has
a
very
light
body
and
almost
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
really
good
strong
flavor
of
blueberries
a
cold
one
on
a
hot
day
is
great
this
beer
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
while
not
the
best
balanced
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
tried
it
is
still
good
enough
to
earn
a
passing
mark
it
does
seem
like
a
good
summertime
brew
and
its
a
nice
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
12
pack
summer
sampler
overall
the
look
and
aroma
of
the
beer
were
quite
awesome
but
unfortunately
the
taste
and
flavor
didnt
live
up
to
the
former
even
so
it
is
still
a
decent
blueberry
lager
and
at
least
is
one
to
try
overall
its
a
nice
summer
beer
and
one
that
goes
well
with
the
summer
mixer
12
packs
i
could
personally
do
with
a
touch
less
blueberry
but
i
think
thats
more
my
tastes
than
anything
flawed
about
this
beer
sam
adams
probably
nailed
their
intentions
on
this
one
perfectly
anyone
who
like
blueberries
blueberry
beers
or
even
just
fruity
beers
or
lagers
will
probably
enjoy
this
brew
opretty
much
what
i
expected
a
blueberry
dominated
easy
drinking
brew
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
its
your
typical
brew
taste
is
nicely
blueberry
but
its
a
pleasant
natural
flavor
rather
than
a
weird
or
artificial
one
indeed
this
ones
summery
light
and
very
enjoyable
sure
its
not
super
complex
or
heavyduty
and
seasoned
hopheads
and
beer
nerds
will
turn
up
their
noses
here
but
i
like
this
blueberry
hill
lager
just
fine
thanks
o
meh
this
was
alright
not
really
a
fruity
beer
kind
of
guy
this
was
not
horrible
it
was
alright
it
just
was
not
exciting
or
enticing
to
me
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
the
pack
but
i
probably
wont
seek
them
out
again
overall
for
a
lager
its
full
enough
for
a
fruit
beer
its
fruity
and
fresh
enough
wasnt
amazing
but
i
quite
liked
the
bitterness
from
the
tettnang
hop
variety
used
here
helped
the
flavor
a
bit
the
beer
appears
a
cloudy
orange
hue
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
brings
blueberry
sweets
sugar
malt
alcohol
sweetened
artificial
blueberries
dominate
the
aroma
and
flavor
one
dimensional
and
unrefined
this
tastes
like
a
large
batch
operation
lacking
the
beauty
that
real
fruit
can
bring
to
a
beer
sweet
throughout
my
body
is
threatening
me
with
a
headache
if
i
continue
this
is
perhaps
not
as
bad
as
i
may
have
made
it
out
to
be
but
certainly
not
my
cup
of
tea
if
you
prefer
sweeter
offerings
this
may
be
worth
a
try
a
few
ounces
was
plenty
for
me
however
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
blueberry
lager
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
blueberry
beers
and
i
think
they
go
best
with
stouts
but
this
one
was
different
and
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
i
expected
so
far
its
the
best
non
stout
blueberry
i
have
had
so
far
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
clean
refreshing
and
the
flavors
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
the
blueberry
might
wear
on
me
after
that
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
nicely
the
blueberry
was
showcased
there
wasnt
any
point
were
the
blueberrys
felt
artificial
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
it
was
great
for
what
they
were
going
for
and
i
cant
think
of
anything
that
was
wrong
with
it
or
that
i
wish
was
changed
it
was
nice
just
the
way
it
is
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
if
they
sold
it
on
its
own
i
wouldnt
turn
down
one
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
keep
on
hand
for
people
that
arent
too
experienced
with
craft
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
fruit
or
blueberry
beers
even
the
regular
lager
drinker
might
enjoy
this
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
started
to
expect
the
worst
since
i
havent
had
the
best
track
record
with
blueberry
beers
but
this
one
was
surprisingly
nice
and
it
may
change
how
i
feel
about
the
style
good
job
sam
adams
you
guys
nailed
what
your
were
going
for
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
will
make
a
great
gateway
beer
into
the
craft
beer
scene
for
a
lot
of
people
nice
work
o
honestly
this
beer
is
making
me
a
little
sick
it
really
isnt
so
terrible
but
man
all
together
it
does
not
do
itself
any
favors
had
this
out
of
the
sam
summer
seasonal
pack
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
pretty
nice
an
orangecopper
with
a
big
head
the
taste
is
blueberry
its
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
tart
most
of
of
the
flavor
comes
through
with
the
finish
again
not
a
big
blueberry
beer
guy
but
there
are
worse
ones
out
there
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
blueberry
jelly
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
blueberry
muffin
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
suite
drinkable
with
a
solid
blueberry
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
the
type
of
beer
i
typically
drink
but
if
i
did
this
wouldnt
be
too
bad
of
an
option
overall
it
has
some
decent
blueberry
flavor
grains
are
mild
but
balanced
and
its
enjoyable
i
have
one
left
but
i
really
couldnt
see
getting
a
six
pack
of
this
aroma
of
pale
malt
with
some
light
citrus
accompanying
the
more
pleasant
than
anticipated
blueberry
character
flavor
follows
suite
with
a
subtle
berry
grain
flavor
a
lightly
chalky
aftertaste
followed
by
a
brief
cleansing
sweetness
blueberry
notes
dont
come
across
as
artificial
and
are
present
yet
not
overdone
in
my
view
decent
feel
with
a
light
grain
character
and
ample
carbonation
interesting
brew
and
not
overdone
subtle
and
pleasant
yet
with
enough
fruit
character
to
keep
it
interesting
for
a
while
anyway
a
darn
good
beer
wish
i
could
find
these
in
6ers
or
12ers
dont
think
they
do
that
though
one
of
the
few
highlights
of
this
years
summer
variety
pack
i
just
got
done
cutting
the
grass
and
sammy
as
blueberry
hill
lager
is
great
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
copper
with
white
head
that
is
lacing
the
scent
has
the
typical
sam
adams
base
with
hints
of
blueberry
the
first
swig
brought
memories
of
blueberry
pie
a
biscuit
base
with
blueberry
fruit
adornments
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
think
it
is
a
great
fruit
style
beer
with
without
being
over
the
top
creative
attempt
and
success
imo
at
a
fruit
beer
in
a
lager
style
works
very
well
the
blueberry
is
present
in
the
nose
more
so
than
on
the
palate
doesnt
overpower
but
melds
nicely
with
the
lemonycitrus
note
from
the
hops
and
the
cereal
notes
from
the
malts
nothing
jumps
out
but
theres
an
overall
understated
flavor
profile
that
offers
a
brew
that
is
easy
drinking
while
still
being
unique
my
first
in
the
sam
adams
summer
pack
was
a
success
it
has
more
character
than
just
blueberry
flavoring
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
really
good
for
a
fruit
beer
fruity
aroma
a
bit
citrusy

m
refreshing
and
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
probably
the
best
blueberry
beer
ive
ever
had
though
id
have
to
have
dfh
black
and
blue
again
to
say
definitively
the
blueberry
comes
across
as
fresh
and
natural
and
the
lager
does
just
enough
to
contribute
without
getting
in
the
way
still
its
drinkable
and
i
actually
like
a
blueberry
flavor
beer
from
time
to
time
for
what
it
is
designed
to
be
it
is
solid
enough
good
strong
blueberry
notes
imprinted
on
a
lager
like
backbone
similar
to
alpine
spring
which
i
find
enjoyable
i
think
the
quality
lager
characteristics
supporting
this
make
it
drinkable
for
example
imagine
a
blueberry
hamms
exactly
this
one
works
well
enough
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
rising
tiny
bubbles
the
nose
is
filled
with
aromas
of
blueberry
i
get
some
of
the
malt
as
well
but
its
pretty
straightforward
with
lots
of
blueberry
the
maltiness
comes
out
more
in
the
flavor
which
brings
some
breadiness
to
meld
with
the
blueberry
flavor
there
is
also
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
end
as
well
which
provides
some
nice
balance
to
this
beer
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
spritzy
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
had
a
nice
golden
amber
color
to
it
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
very
bubbly
head
dose
go
down
a
bit
the
smell
remind
me
of
blueberry
cobler
with
a
little
hint
of
citrus
maybe
the
fell
of
the
beer
was
very
smoth
and
crisp
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
tase
of
the
furit
was
not
too
over
power
and
well
balnce
with
the
wheet
and
grains
maybe
a
little
hops

very
easy
to
drink
better
than
several
other
blueberry
beers
either
ale
or
lager
ive
tried
my
wife
would
love
this
i
will
have
no
problem
killing
off
the
other
3
in
this
summer
variety
case
the
blueberry
in
this
doesnt
seem
forced
a
pleasant
suprise
summer
sampler
complete
with
token
fruit
wheat
fizzy
beer
to
complement
the
boston
lager
and
the
summer
ale
this
one
pours
bright
golden
with
a
slight
haziness
large
slight
off
white
head
flowing
nicely
leaves
behind
fine
speckled
lacing
aroma
gives
off
some
tart
notes
of
citrus
and
berry
jam
pretty
one
noted
sharp
wheat
accents
flavor
brings
tart
berry
jam
with
sharp
wheat
ale
acidity
biscuit
dough
yeast
cake
action
complements
with
a
hint
of
citrus
in
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
full
on
flowing
carbonation
not
too
spritzed
up
or
overdone
in
anyway
linger
natural
blueberry
flavors
between
sips
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
part
of
a
sampler
refreshing
summery
it
fills
the
quota
and
theres
really
nothing
too
off
overall
better
than
a
lot
of
other
berry
beers
and
could
hit
the
spot
if
you
are
indeed
craving
some
alcohol
with
your
blueberries
but
as
it
verged
on
some
artificial
flavors
it
could
have
been
better
aroma
is
of
blueberries
hops
and
pale
malt
body
is
medium
and
crisp
taste
is
of
blueberries
spicy
hops
lemon
zest
and
biscuit
malt
finish
is
long
and
slightly
tart
nice
refreshing
brew
i
try
and
taste
any
sam
adams
beer
i
see
their
brewery
in
boston
was
the
first
brewery
tour
i
ever
went
on
so
i
hold
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
their
beers
also
the
first
beers
i
really
liked
before
getting
into
some
really
hoppy
beers
out
there
were
fruit
beers
when
i
saw
this
blueberry
hill
i
was
pretty
interested
in
trying
it
i
like
sweetwater
blue
and
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
so
i
was
keen
on
seeing
what
this
one
was
all
about
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
the
smell
was
more
hops
and
less
blueberry
the
taste
is
way
more
packed
with
blueberry
flavor
than
the
smell
would
let
on
also
this
beer
isnt
as
sweet
to
me
as
the
sweetwater
and
sunset
wheat
which
is
fine
those
2
in
comparison
tend
to
get
the
old
head
throbbing
when
i
drink
a
ton
of
them
which
i
attribute
to
the
sweetness
i
think
there
is
enough
tang
from
the
hops
to
make
this
a
really
good
fruit
beer
i
think
this
one
could
appeal
to
hoppy
beer
fans
as
well
as
fruit
beer
fans
o
an
excellent
brew
i
would
easily
buy
a
12
pack
of
the
blueberry
hill
lager
wasnt
expecting
this
light
brew
taste
from
a
boston
brewery
lager
now
i
know
what
yallre
thinkin
but
no
im
not
gonna
make
a
fats
domino
reference
its
just
too
easy
man
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
syrupy
blueberry
yknow
thick
and
partially
artificial
without
bashing
you
over
the
head
with
its
fakeness
over
a
carpet
of
very
light
biscuit
barely
hanging
on
for
dear
life
against
the
torrent
of
berry
the
taste
proves
my
suspicions
about
the
artificiality
were
warranted
if
still
wrong
in
full
reality
as
some
plastic
weeds
its
way
into
the
berries
in
the
background
those
touted
noble
hops
serve
only
to
provide
a
clashing
foil
of
greenery
for
the
berries
muddying
the
waters
into
a
bayou
of
unhappiness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thankfully
dry
and
quick
finish
overall
things
just
didnt
go
well
with
this
one
as
the
berries
come
across
as
fake
and
the
hops
battle
rather
than
bolster
the
fruitiness
its
not
as
bad
as
the
horridity
that
was
the
cranberry
lambic
but
its
certainly
nowhere
near
good
either
o
definitely
a
novelty
beer
liked
the
smell
but
the
taste
was
kind
of
disappointing
refreshing
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
fruit
beer
is
a
difficult
thing
to
get
right
it
is
rare
to
find
a
beer
that
brings
real
balance
flavor
and
drinkability
this
beer
makes
a
good
attempt
but
ultimately
falls
short
of
being
rally
good
it
is
a
slightly
heavy
pale
golden
color
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
predominantly
blueberry
with
a
nice
whiff
of
earthy
hops
there
is
as
sweet
pale
malt
underneath
unfortunately
its
smell
reminds
me
of
booberry
crunch
the
taste
is
a
bit
ore
beer
like
with
some
malt
and
grain
character
and
some
more
genuine
berry
flavor
soft
finish
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
not
my
style
and
surely
not
great
but
good
and
flaver
a
very
enjoyable
brew
the
blueberry
taste
does
not
give
a
bad
aftertaste
and
leaves
a
nice
flaver
of
blueberry
as
well
as
the
flaver
of
a
quality
lager
beer
o
a
very
nice
refreshing
brew
going
to
be
very
nice
when
the
hot
summer
weather
rolls
in
really
enjoying
this
one
right
now
merely
okay
average
how
good
can
a
blueberry
lager
be
anyways
cloudy
gold
topped
by
a
solid
slab
of
thick
foam
tart
juicy
blueberry
aromas
upfront
with
a
sort
of
creamy
sweetness
a
little
less
blueberry
forward
in
the
flavor
berry
sweetness
grain
spiciness
and
a
citrusy
touch
near
the
end
light
slightly
acidic
and
decently
crisp
a
decent
warm
weather
drinker
but
not
something
i
need
more
than
one
of
if
you
enjoy
fruit
flavored
beer
youll
probably
like
this
beer
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
sam
adams
o
a
decent
blueberry
lager
with
an
almost
blueberry
pielike
aroma
and
taste
from
the
malts
not
bad
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
often
aside
from
maybe
with
blueberry
pie
during
a
cookout
not
as
a
good
as
id
hoped
and
im
a
sucker
for
fruity
beers
good
for
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
overall
another
fruity
brew
offering
from
samuel
adams
if
you
like
blueberries
youll
like
this
not
overtly
sweet
like
some
of
the
other
blueberry
beers
on
the
market
not
as
good
as
their
blackberry
wit
but
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
its
summer
mix
counterpart
porch
rocker
i
would
take
this
over
many
if
not
most
of
the
other
lagers
from
sam
adams
or
anywhere
else
i
suppose
the
blueberry
is
clearly
there
in
both
smell
and
taste
which
is
refreshing
the
aftertaste
provides
some
barely
noticeable
tartness
the
finish
has
that
familiar
lager
blandness
to
it
this
isnt
a
bad
drink
at
all
and
a
little
less
boring
than
the
standard
lager
enjoy
this
served
quite
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
probably
would
not
get
it
again
overall
an
ok
beer
not
something
i
would
buy
as
a
six
pack
but
it
isnt
something
i
would
pour
out
either
picture
of
an
ok
beer
high
d
first
before
i
try
it
i
love
blueberry
wine
and
beer
if
done
right
we
will
see
soon
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
color
with
a
solid
white
head
without
trying
to
seem
ridiculous
it
has
a
very
blueberry
smell
to
it
it
has
a
bit
of
activity
to
it
as
of
now
trying
one
it
is
very
drinkable
very
good
i
love
blueberries
i
bought
a
sam
adams
summer
sampler
and
while
it
did
snow
in
indiana
today
it
is
still
enjoyable
probably
would
be
a
good
breakfast
beer
lol
i
cant
imagine
eating
steak
with
this
but
if
you
were
at
a
festival
wanted
to
drink
with
breakfast
or
in
the
afternoon
with
a
lot
of
sun
watching
shows
this
could
be
refreshing
its
all
quite
solid
but
sometimes
i
really
wish
boston
beer
co
would
be
willing
to
diverge
a
bit
from
the
boston
lager
template
i
mean
yes
this
is
obviously
quite
different
from
boston
lager
but
like
nearly
all
of
all
of
sas
beers
it
has
just
about
the
same
body
as
boston
lager
as
well
as
the
same
bittersweet
biscuit
yeast
back
end
it
works
like
i
said
but
just
barely
and
deviating
a
bit
could
have
helped
it
come
together
much
more
nicely
overall
an
enjoyable
fruit
beer
with
natural
tasting
blueberry
flavor
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
pretty
good
and
there
is
a
moderate
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
fruity
there
is
a
delicate
aroma
of
sweet
blueberry
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
plenty
of
blueberry
flavors
there
isnt
much
depth
to
this
beer
very
one
dimensional
the
mouthfeel
of
it
is
lighter
bodied
good
carbonation
but
a
little
on
the
cloying
side
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
too
sweet
i
think
it
will
be
better
in
the
dead
of
summer
i
dont
think
that
blueberries
work
well
in
lagers
theyre
better
suited
to
ales
and
i
say
this
only
because
i
love
blueberries
and
anything
flavored
with
blueberries
however
this
isnt
as
bad
as
wild
blue
ugh
so
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
on
this
one
and
the
blueberry
flavor
seems
authentic
i
still
am
not
convinced
that
blueberry
is
an
appropriate
flavoring
for
beer
but
then
im
not
swedish
from
a
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
ralphs
supermarket
in
san
clemente
o
well
nothing
wowing
here
but
i
gotta
say
im
enjoying
it
blueberry
is
everywhere
with
this
beer
and
although
its
a
strong
taste
of
it
its
pretty
natural
tasting
to
me
balanced
out
with
that
lager
yeast
in
there
refreshing
as
beer
gets
id
drink
it
again
but
i
cant
say
id
buy
it
again
for
sure
definitely
worth
a
try
though
cheers
o
i
could
imagine
a
setting
where
this
beer
might
really
hit
the
spot
every
other
time
i
would
think
its
too
fruity
this
is
an
okay
offering
from
sa
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
it
isnt
awful
but
i
certainly
will
not
seek
it
out
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
touch
of
biscuit
malt
but
what
really
comes
through
is
a
ton
of
sweet
blueberries
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
blueberry
notes
add
some
nice
flavor
as
well
as
a
good
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
basically
a
light
american
lager
with
some
raspberries
thrown
in
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
just
what
it
is
i
like
picking
this
up
from
time
to
time
to
have
on
hot
days
i
like
this
beer
great
for
summer
days
on
the
golf
course
not
to
strong
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
recommend
great
taste
just
a
hint
of
fruit
best
served
on
draft
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beer
recently
enjoyed
at
fishbar
manhattan
beach
march
21
2015
honestly
this
beer
smelled
horrible
like
somebody
got
sick
had
two
already
and
both
were
the
same
so
it
wasnt
just
an
off
beer
it
pours
a
pale
lavender
color
almost
no
head
taste
is
fruit
and
berries
at
first
then
malt
and
clove
and
that
artificial
banana
type
flavor
you
get
in
some
wheats
which
i
like
but
the
combination
of
that
with
the
berries
makes
it
almost
undrinkable
for
me
ill
finish
the
six
but
will
never
think
about
buying
this
again
nice
mouth
feel
nice
raspberry
flavor
easy
drink
very
fruity
taste
popular
amongst
the
ladies
at
good
at
the
end
light
the
strong
taste
of
fruit
disappear
basically
a
decent
beer
but
not
much
else
i
do
like
the
fact
that
they
tried
something
different
here
but
nothing
really
stands
out
as
being
outstanding
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
other
than
that
nothing
overly
outstanding
overall
somewhat
underwhelming
but
still
fairly
tasty
id
have
it
again
but
its
nothing
exciting
underrated
beer
very
creative
and
refreshing
but
still
tastes
like
a
beer
and
not
a
girly
substitute
bottle
of
purple
haze
drank
overall
wont
drink
again
perfect
beer
for
the
type
of
person
who
would
normally
drink
twisted
yea
or
mikes
hard
over
beer
do
not
like
cant
drink
my
wife
did
like
it
though
which
explains
why
she
hates
beer
great
light
beer
for
out
on
the
boat
just
easy
to
drink
this
beer
tastes
like
artificial
flavoring
it
made
me
vomit
gross
my
husband
bought
me
this
and
i
was
like
uhhhh
thanks
i
guess
grape
beer
well
he
told
me
it
was
raspberry
which
i
love
and
was
still
thinking
gross
sweet
syrupy
nope
i
was
wrong
it
was
a
light
raspberry
taste
great
for
summer
very
drinkable
drank
a
bunch
and
now
i
need
more
for
a
much
better
raspberry
beer
try
founders
rubaeus
spellings
off
because
the
u
has
the
german
umlaut
at
least
when
you
get
a
macro
you
know
what
to
expect
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
great
look
smell
taste
great
beer
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
reviewing
this
as
a
raspberry
lager
nice
golden
color
with
little
head
smells
like
slightly
sour
raspberries
smooth
balanced
lager
with
a
good
tart
tartness
from
the
raspberries
easy
drinker
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
labeled
great
chill
beer
maybe
a
scarface
or
marvel
movie
relax
beer
not
clean
enough
for
a
clean
and
not
sour
enough
for
a
sour
not
my
favored
beer
yet
this
has
a
strong
following
not
bad
very
available
and
sometime
is
not
as
good
as
others
be
sure
to
check
bottled
on
date
my
favorite
craft
beer
on
the
market
nice
taste
of
with
a
hint
of
raspberries
raspberry
flavor
i
could
pick
up
on
my
girlfriend
could
not
i
think
the
beer
is
great
for
what
it
is
good
raspberry
flavored
wheat
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
would
take
it
over
anything
adjunct
anyday
however
not
my
typical
brew
low
abv
and
ibus
along
with
a
very
light
almost
diet
raspberry
taste
glad
i
tried
it
but
doubt
i
will
purchase
again
great
fruity
undertones
but
not
overpowering
a
bit
too
berry
and
the
aroma
not
so
pleasant
but
was
enjoyable
overall
i
like
the
haze
better
mixed
with
other
abita
beers
cool
label
and
the
color
of
the
beer
in
a
clear
glass
it
neat
but
nothing
special
about
the
beers
taste
no
raspberry
flavor
at
all
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
this
is
a
little
different
but
a
very
good
beer
give
it
a
try
really
good
if
you
enjoy
raspberry
nice
color
decent
head
really
nice
fruity
flavor
strong
fruity
wheat
flavors
very
good
with
a
nice
raspberry
flavor
this
was
just
truly
horrid
nice
fruitiness
with
the
raspberry
purée
added
after
fermentation
wheaty
finish
with
a
nice
hazy
color
damn
good
this
was
the
first
abita
beer
ive
had
and
its
still
my
first
love
sweet
refreshing
and
just
an
allaround
tasty
brew
its
great
out
of
the
bottle
but
outstanding
on
tap
a
nice
clean
beer
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
good
for
relaxing
on
your
summer
deck
the
bottle
and
label
makes
this
beer
look
like
some
kind
of
daunting
stout
but
dont
be
fooled
it
pours
into
a
pale
honey
colored
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
raspberry
flavor
little
artificial
tasting
but
i
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
few
beers
i
can
say
is
too
light
for
me
i
like
the
idea
of
it
but
it
sorta
just
tastes
like
sugar
free
juicy
juice
with
a
hint
of
beer
very
refreshing
though
good
beer
food
match
this
beer
would
pair
well
with
sushi
or
sashimi
calm
smooth
and
enjoyable
if
this
beer
were
a
woman
i
would
kiss
dating
goodbye
and
court
her
for
marriage
purple
haze
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
real
fruit
flavor
and
not
artificial

b
good
beer
i
had
this
on
a
evening
with
they
guys
at
my
old
job
in
a
sushi
eaterypub
taste
good
but
leaves
more
to
be
desired
body
feels
watery
carbonation
is
much
too
low
honestly
its
not
as
great
as
all
the
hype
that
was
surrounding
it
when
i
had
it
but
it
is
worth
a
try
and
very
easyenjoyable
to
drink
smooth
light
quite
crisp
refreshing
and
probably
palatabledrinkable
to
anyone
who
tries
it
i
especially
appreciate
the
raspberry
puree
that
was
brewed
into
it
high
raspberry
flavor
orangish
in
color
different
but
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
raspberry
ale
great
balance
between
the
fruit
some
honeylike
sweetness
wheat
malt
and
slightly
bitter
hops
delicious
im
certainly
getting
a
few
of
these
again
this
coming
summer
p
pairs
best
with
adventurea
in
bonton
and
sookie
stackhouses
fae
alternate
reality
and
im
listening
to
all
along
the
watchtower
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
dry
wheat
raspberry
syrup
and
a
touch
of
corn
the
taste
leads
with
the
corn
before
immediately
getting
blindsided
by
the
very
artificialtasting
raspberry
syrup
then
everything
returns
to
a
bland
corny
situation
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
beer
aint
my
jam
no
raspberry
pun
intended
what
with
the
artificial
taste
and
onesadnote
offering
its
not
horrible
but
ill
likely
never
drink
one
again
what
i
would
call
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
the
pour
is
dark
redpurple
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
berries
specifically
raspberry
the
taste
is
similar
although
a
little
more
reserved
very
sweet
which
made
it
a
bit
hard
to
pair
with
most
food
besides
deserts
though
overall
a
very
nice
beer
overall
not
outstanding
but
good
by
my
standards
i
really
dont
taste
the
raspberry
all
i
taste
is
muck
love
o
very
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
could
make
a
session
with
this
one
cheers
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
one
usually
i
dont
go
for
flavored
beers
because
they
tend
to
be
very
sugary
however
this
one
seems
to
have
that
perfect
balance
its
amber
colored
with
a
white
foamy
head
and
looks
great
my
first
smell
i
assumed
it
was
going
to
be
very
sugary
because
it
seemed
very
sweet
and
had
light
raspberry
tones
luckily
i
was
proven
wrong
its
light
to
medium
bodied
and
has
a
great
fruity
feel
finishing
with
strong
notes
of
malts
and
wheat
its
well
balanced
and
layered
wonderfully
pours
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
is
of
wheat
and
raspberries
the
taste
is
the
same
actually
with
the
perfect
blend
of
bot
the
raspberries
and
wheat
where
not
one
was
over
powering
at
all
not
as
sweet
as
you
might
thing
and
finished
with
a
slight
tangy
finish
overall
a
tasty
brew
o
average
beer
not
too
much
taste
or
aromas
going
on
the
raspberry
is
present
but
is
not
overpowering
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
lager
however
it
does
not
live
up
to
its
name
there
should
be
more
fruit
flavor
and
a
bit
more
sweetness
the
label
goes
as
far
as
to
say
you
may
even
see
some
fruit
pulp
im
not
buying
that
mildly
refreshing
could
use
improvement
nice
aroma
good
berry
wheat
flavor
although
it
tends
to
lean
a
little
to
the
artificial
flavor
side
good
drinking
beer
with
a
great
aroma
decent
head
and
color
will
drink
again
but
wint
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
decent
on
tap
but
better
out
of
the
bottle
nice
effort
and
a
unique
beer
o
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
that
are
just
getting
into
craft
beer
also
appeals
to
nonbeer
drinkers
refreshing
but
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
to
have
another
this
beer
is
a
decent
beer
i
know
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
when
i
had
this
beer
i
actually
had
it
in
a
bottle
and
on
draft
the
bottle
and
the
draft
was
good
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
still
was
good
i
would
not
have
any
problems
recommending
this
beer
to
someone
not
horrible
but
somewhat
uninteresting
and
pedestrian
overall
decent
but
not
exciting
not
bad
but
not
great
either
its
crisp
up
front
and
doesnt
fall
off
too
much
at
the
end
though
a
little
the
body
is
light
but
verges
on
being
thin
though
it
avoids
that
as
well
smoothness
is
moderate
as
a
touch
of
dryness
sneaks
into
the
finish
bbd
011314
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
just
a
touch
of
purple
shading
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
pour
is
hazy
from
pulp
light
head
that
diminishes
in
2
minutes
with
little
lacing
very
light
nose
of
raspberry
light
bodied
with
some
pulp
normal
carbonation
level
the
weak
flavor
profile
is
raspberry
but
you
have
to
look
for
it
since
there
is
very
little
flavor
present
the
finish
has
mild
effervescence
that
brings
raspberry
more
forward
with
a
bit
of
tartness
i
only
tried
this
because
of
my
love
of
abita
and
raspberries
i
didnt
expect
very
much
when
i
tried
it
and
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
like
it
in
reality
just
think
about
your
other
preferences
if
you
dont
like
fruit
beers
raspberries
or
the
like
you
probably
wouldnt
like
this
if
youre
like
me
and
a
raspberry
fiend
and
like
beer
youd
enjoy
it
overall
i
have
another
23
of
these
cans
to
go
and
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
into
craftmicros
probably
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
that
ive
had
you
can
definitely
taste
the
raspberries
and
its
a
cool
purple
colour
interesting
and
worth
a
try
but
im
not
really
big
on
fruit
beers
so
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
again
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
ladys
who
dont
like
beer
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
gave
my
wife
she
liked
it
but
now
that
she
has
acquired
the
taste
of
beer
she
cant
stand
it
what
makes
this
beer
cool
is
that
it
has
a
fruity
essence
without
a
sweet
fruit
taste
this
is
a
beer
i
would
never
drink
myself
but
keep
on
hand
for
those
inexperienced
beer
drinkers
if
you
dig
something
like
a
raspberry
juice
with
pils
that
may
be
your
beverage
choice
very
refreshing
overall
this
could
be
a
nice
summer
drink
not
for
me
but
good
to
try
out
enjoyable
brew
and
easy
to
drink
purple
haze
pours
a
darker
reddish
color
with
not
much
head
there
is
an
aroma
with
a
pale
wheat
note
and
a
strange
sweetness
the
taste
is
much
the
same
pale
wheat
undertones
with
a
weird
strange
out
of
place
sweetness
from
the
raspberries
awkward
flavors
and
rather
too
fizzy
overall
its
light
fizzy
and
way
to
sweet
and
the
flavors
dont
mix
that
well
o
for
what
it
is
its
a
decent
beer
i
could
see
drinking
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
working
outside
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
goblet
worth
a
try
if
only
to
say
youve
had
something
with
such
an
apt
name
from
the
60s
o
this
would
be
nice
enjoyed
on
a
warm
summer
day
easy
to
slam
back
and
the
alcohol
would
make
it
session
able
summary
to
me
this
is
not
a
beer
maybe
a
raspberry
cider
or
something
its
just
got
this
weird
feeling
to
it
and
its
so
fizzy
i
suppose
it
isnt
a
bad
drink
but
for
me
it
is
a
bad
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
depth
than
an
alcoholic
raspberry
spritzer
i
made
a
really
bad
choice
ordering
this
beer
it
was
the
only
non
bmc
tap
later
i
saw
some
bottles
that
would
have
been
better
unfortunate
that
it
was
my
last
beer
of
2013
i
will
never
ever
subject
myself
to
it
again
yuck
we
had
it
with
seafood
this
evening
fitting
for
a
cajun
ale
abita
purple
haze
is
a
crisp
american
style
wheat
beer
with
fresh
raspberries
added
during
secondary
fermentation
subtle
coloration
fruity
aroma
and
tartly
sweet
taste
some
may
not
care
for
unfiltered
beers
but
most
would
enjoy
this
anyway
as
it
is
still
crisp
and
cleansing
over
all
light
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
light
fruit
flavor
i
know
this
seem
bias
me
rating
it
as
high
as
i
did
however
this
was
an
excellent
beer
to
me
it
had
just
the
right
ammount
of
bitternes
and
flavor
i
dont
do
very
strong
beers
and
thats
why
i
liked
this
one
it
was
the
perfect
balance
i
have
had
it
both
in
bottle
and
on
tap
the
best
part
about
the
bottle
is
the
actual
raspberries
floating
in
t
overall
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
allhowever
not
a
gr8
one
eitherhas
a
nice
smootheasy
drinkability
and
they
slide
right
downbut
just
not
enough
flavoryou
know
you
are
drinking
a
fruit
beer
4surebut
it
just
doesnt
quite
make
the
cut
and
falls
just
a
bit
short
for
mei
like
it
as
a
whole
but
for
almost
10
bucks
a
6eri
can
buy
much
better
fruit
beers
for
a
lot
lessif
perhaps
it
was
67
bucks
a
6eri
would
think
about
buying
it
again
because
ice
cold
on
a
really
hot
day
this
a
is
decent
really
refreshing
beerand
the
low
abv
4
2
mixed
with
the
lightness
of
this
brew
makes
it
a
gr8
summer
time
session
beerit
wont
fill
you
up
or
hammer
you
into
oblivion
when
its
hot
a
hell
outmaybe
this
beer
is
just
really
priced
extra
high
in
my
area
oc
marylandand
thats
too
badbecause
as
i
said
i
would
buy
it
again
if
it
was
priced
a
bit
lessbut
it
just
is
not
worth
10
bucks
a
6ercheers
and
peace
to
all
oa
poorly
executed
fruit
beer
the
only
plus
side
is
that
nothing
was
artificial
tasting
mouthfeel
was
was
ok
and
soda
poppish
i
have
seen
this
beer
numerous
time
and
was
always
curious
what
it
tasted
like
it
has
a
great
aroma
with
the
subtle
smell
of
blackbeary
i
personally
wouldnt
get
again
because
the
taste
is
bland
its
not
that
it
has
a
bad
taste
just
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
at
all
overall
nothing
to
write
home
to
mom
about
i
think
one
would
need
to
be
on
the
same
stuff
jimi
was
to
truly
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
continue
to
try
them
hoping
to
find
one
that
is
amazing
purple
haze
is
good
but
its
not
amazing
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
thin
white
head
with
no
lace
the
scent
and
taste
are
accented
by
raspberries
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
ok
lawn
mower
beer
for
sure
o
did
not
meet
expectations
good
for
one
or
two
but
would
not
buy
another
6
pack
its
an
attractive
beer
but
its
exceedingly
simple
i
tasted
no
flavor
at
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
very
disappointed
after
two
taste
did
not
improve
and
i
felt
nothing
bottle
has
nice
design
catches
your
eye
looked
good
in
glass
but
had
no
flavor
whatsoever
that
i
could
detect
o
better
than
the
component
scores
would
suggest
honestly
im
disappointed
by
what
i
thought
it
would
be
but
on
the
whole
its
just
fine
for
what
it
is
o
slightly
disappointed
in
the
fruit
beer
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
refreshing
after
working
outside
i
have
had
this
beer
at
tastings
once
or
twice
and
decided
to
give
it
a
review
im
surprised
this
is
a
lager
since
i
get
a
distinct
wheatbeer
character
and
no
distinct
malt
flavor
not
really
something
to
seek
out
but
still
a
nice
easydrinking
and
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
unfiltered
appearance
raspberries
added
after
filtration
almost
orange
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
mild
head
very
fruity
and
sweet
aromayou
can
definitely
discern
the
raspberries
tastes
almost
like
raspberries
dropped
in
a
light
beer
not
exactly
in
a
refreshing
way
not
much
depth
a
little
tart
which
is
nice
the
beer
fails
for
us
not
on
the
raspberry
inclusion
but
on
the
beer
portion
itself
i
rarely
fail
to
finish
a
beer
once
i
open
it
but
this
one
got
the
better
of
me
i
just
couldnt
find
anything
to
enjoy

extremely
smooth

i
definitely
enjoyed
this
as
a
nice
sessionable
brew
its
just
a
disappointment
yuck
serving
type
tap
overall
its
a
little
too
watery
for
me
and
its
almost
seltzerlike
but
purple
haze
absolutely
has
its
place
for
the
long
summer
months
od
definitely
not
a
standout
very
much
a
gateway
into
craft
stuff
with
the
obvious
fruit
addition
decent
but
i
probably
wouldnt
try
it
again

berry
and
not
much
else
taste
was
light
and
also
of
berry
not
much
else
maouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
with
a
light
sweet
aftertaste
also
with
pronounced
berry
flavor
o
simplistic
but
pleasing
a
fresh
fruit
taste
and
contrasting
tartness
save
it
from
being
just
another
nondescript
fruity
wheat
ale
overall
a
decent
fruit
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
well
poured
this
fruit
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
golden
purple
hazy
color
produced
a
creamy
white
head
decent
retention
and
it
left
an
average
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
raspberries
and
malted
grain
light
to
medium
bodied
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
tart
raspberry
and
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
overall
decent
fruit
beer
the
main
plus
for
me
with
this
one
is
that
there
is
not
a
sticky
artificial
fruit
flavor
that
many
fruit
beers
have
nice
session
beer
o
i
cant
stand
fruit
beers
in
general
this
is
no
exception
i
like
about
everything
else
abita
does
but
this
smells
terrible
and
is
just
generic
this
is
one
of
my
mardi
gras
favorites
i
hate
sweet
beers
and
had
a
bias
against
this
one
before
ever
tasting
it
turns
out
its
not
sweet
more
aromatic
and
finish
for
the
raspberry
flavor
abita
has
some
great
tastes
and
this
is
one
that
should
stand
for
a
long
time
git
u
sum
son
overall
solid
for
a
lighter
fruit
wheat
beer
the
raspberry
taste
is
pretty
good
and
avoids
becoming
too
sweet
or
tart
overall
this
is
nice
simple
and
unpretentious
o
better
than
its
rating
led
me
to
believe
exceeded
expectations
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
o
overall
i
thought
the
beer
works
really
well
as
a
refreshment
or
something
to
to
drink
with
a
very
light
dessert
or
light
meal
it
would
make
a
good
lawnmower
beer
this
is
very
reminiscent
of
abitas
strawberry
harvest
lager
so
if
you
enjoy
that
beer
i
believe
you
will
enjoy
this
one
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
im
usually
not
one
to
enjoy
raspberry
fruity
beers
however
this
one
had
a
very
subtle
fruit
taste
that
was
very
dry
had
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
was
very
refreshing
the
only
thing
i
did
not
like
about
this
was
the
dryness
i
enjoyed
about
2
of
them
and
by
the
3rd
one
i
was
growing
tired
of
the
dry
mouthfeel
but
overall
the
fruity
aroma
refreshing
taste
and
inviting
appearance
was
pretty
good
o
easy
drinking
brew
light
on
flavor
would
buy
again
for
warm
drinking
days
one
and
done
for
me
as
the
fruity
beers
go
i
like
this
one
because
it
doesnt
taste
artificial
or
overly
sweet
the
pour
is
a
tad
unnatural
with
an
odd
purple
hue
to
an
already
cloudy
brew
there
is
about
an
inch
of
slowly
dissipating
white
head
the
nose
is
like
muddled
raspberries
fresh
and
tart
with
the
sweetness
only
coming
in
the
taste
there
is
a
light
wheat
malt
to
this
as
well
as
some
american
pale
malt
which
give
it
more
body
than
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
have
the
taste
shows
some
hopping
toward
the
finish
which
tames
what
would
otherwise
be
a
punishingly
sweet
conclusion
i
like
the
freshness
of
the
raspberries
though
they
taste
just
picked
to
me
and
it
makes
an
excellent
summer
drink
i
see
this
as
an
early
tee
time
brew
low
alcohol
juicy
and
sessionable
despite
the
sugary
vibe
great
carbonation
gives
a
light
and
bright
mouthfeel
down
easy
not
my
thing
in
the
winter
time
but
ask
me
again
on
a
hot
golf
course
around
1030am
sometime
this
summer
and
i
will
have
an
entirely
different
opinion
one
of
the
more
palatable
abita
brews
ive
come
across
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
122812
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
browngolden
color
with
a
massive
wheat
beer
sized
head
which
has
a
long
retention
the
smells
are
similar
to
a
pilsner
some
grass
hops
wheat
and
a
hint
of
raspberries
the
feel
is
medium
to
a
little
thinner
the
taste
is
okay
more
thin
and
light
than
i
was
expecting
you
get
some
wheat
very
faint
hop
bitterness
almost
none
and
a
very
light
raspberry
far
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
i
am
impressed
with
the
name
as
it
could
not
describe
the
appearance
any
better
hazy
and
yes
purple
this
wheat
beer
is
quite
pretty
i
smell
berry
on
the
nose
but
it
does
seem
a
bit
manufactured
the
taste
is
nice
raspberries
and
wheat
the
raspberries
seem
to
be
more
from
a
bottle
and
less
real
id
call
this
a
cheer
beer
but
i
liked
it
enough
that
i
drank
two
it
wont
set
the
craft
beer
world
on
fire
but
it
will
sell
a
lot
of
bottles
of
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
good
sized
whit
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
funny
but
for
a
beer
brewed
with
raspberries
and
called
purple
haze
i
was
definitely
expecting
more
color
the
nose
holds
a
bit
of
tart
raspberry
along
with
a
spicy
wheat
and
bready
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
mild
raspberry
flavor
that
peeks
in
and
out
of
a
bready
honey
like
spicy
wheat
malt
base
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
watery
and
slick
mouthfeel
this
is
just
so
blah
the
berries
feel
weak
and
artificial
and
the
underlying
beer
is
uninspiring
as
well
the
raspberries
dont
really
come
through
in
the
aroma
but
ive
never
really
had
a
raspbrew
that
has
so
im
not
surprised
it
doesnt
really
have
a
strong
armoa
the
cool
part
is
that
the
berries
come
out
and
sucker
punch
you
once
you
take
a
sip
and
then
it
fades
quickly
getting
replaced
by
easily
detectable
wheat
malts
yet
the
raspberries
linger
more
than
the
malts
in
the
overall
aftertaste
it
makes
for
an
interesting
experience
and
its
one
id
do
again
pretty
good
for
a
fruit
beer
excellent
smelling
with
average
tastes
o
a
decent
beer
but
not
much
above
average
flavors
were
wellexecuted
but
lacked
complexity
i
was
pleased
that
the
blend
of
ingredients
and
flavors
were
such
that
the
sweetness
of
the
raspberry
did
not
overpower
the
beer
this
brews
reputation
preceded
it
but
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
expectations
if
offered
as
a
selection
at
a
gathering
id
keep
looking
the
brew
poured
with
a
two
finger
white
head
with
an
orange
cloudy
body
there
was
no
visible
carbonation
due
to
the
cloudiness
there
was
a
lot
of
fruit
mostly
raspberry
on
the
nose
which
is
to
be
expected
there
is
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
first
sip
is
a
lot
of
raspberries
but
a
lot
of
carbonation
ive
had
this
before
and
this
is
not
what
it
tastes
like
something
is
missing
it
almost
tastes
like
raspberry
seltzer
there
is
definitely
something
wrong
with
this
beer
its
so
watery
and
weak
this
pint
is
definitely
not
reflective
of
the
beer
itself
normally
the
beer
is
a
nice
mouthful
of
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
wheat
mixed
in
it
goes
down
quick
and
it
goes
down
easy
not
this
one
i
think
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
pint
anyways
abita
purple
haze
is
an
easy
session
beer
with
some
great
flavor
just
dont
try
it
at
court
jester
in
freehold
pours
a
clear
reddishyellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
grain
and
some
slight
berry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
perfumelike
flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
clear
pink
like
water
piss
and
strawberry
juice
it
definitely
has
a
slight
purple
haze
there
is
little
to
no
head
but
a
ring
around
the
glass
that
is
soap
white
the
beer
is
quite
hazy
and
clear
amber
which
is
a
strange
color
for
beer
the
beer
smells
like
sour
bread
with
some
nice
wheat
wafting
and
a
salty
stale
bread
smell
as
it
settles
and
it
almost
reminds
me
of
buttered
toast
the
beer
tastes
heavy
with
wheat
malt
with
an
ohsosubtle
hint
of
raspberries
overall
it
seems
to
give
a
taste
of
flavored
water
with
a
lot
of
wheat
the
aftertaste
brings
the
tart
fruit
a
little
more
forward
but
still
it
remains
quite
mellow
the
mouthfeel
begins
a
little
uncomfortable
with
carbonation
but
settles
out
into
a
thick
and
oddly
creamy
feel
and
is
really
quite
drinkable
and
watery
this
beer
just
cant
decide
what
it
is
i
dont
get
enough
malt
and
not
enough
fruity
flavors
for
me
it
sits
uncomfortably
in
the
middle
and
thus
doesnt
seem
to
really
claim
a
category
and
leaves
me
at
a
loss
to
label
it
this
is
a
meh
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
orangish
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
of
sweet
berries
but
with
some
balance
with
the
grain
has
a
bit
of
a
tart
taste
but
it
is
very
good
and
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
this
light
bodied
beer
is
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
still
goes
down
real
smooth
overall
an
above
average
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
raspberry
beer
its
not
too
sweet
nor
does
it
have
an
artificial
flavor
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
a
good
beer
for
a
nice
hot
day
outside
overall
simple
but
solid
raspberry
wheat
beer
its
crisp
carbonation
is
what
separates
this
from
a
raspberry
wheat
like
sea
dog
let
me
start
out
saying
this
ive
been
on
beeradvocate
for
close
to
4
years
and
ive
never
felt
obligated
to
review
a
beer
however
this
thing
they
call
a
beer
so
disturbed
my
taste
buds
i
couldnt
help
it
my
girlfriend
who
will
put
down
bluepaw
and
milk
stout
all
day
said
she
couldnt
even
smell
it
it
tastes
like
moldy
rainwater
at
best
i
would
rather
have
to
snort
milwakees
best
interesting
combo
of
fruit
and
lager
nothing
sensationable
but
fresher
tasting
than
most
other
fruit
beers
also
to
add
another
note
this
is
a
fruit
beer
i
could
have
more
than
just
one
of
not
too
heavy
one
fruit
and
not
loaded
with
wheat
once
i
got
home
i
poured
one
in
a
glass
and
was
immediately
taken
by
the
color
the
pale
yellow
tinged
with
a
purple
haze
was
truly
unique
the
head
was
on
the
thin
side
but
no
beer
is
perfect
you
get
the
raspberry
flavor
but
its
not
that
strong
much
less
fruity
than
most
fruit
beers
its
an
inoffensive
pleasant
tasting
slightly
fruity
beer
that
is
fine
for
a
hot
summer
day
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
an
amberish
color
wiith
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sour
berries
taste
is
tart
lots
of
berries
a
bit
of
grains
and
malts
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
the
head
was
still
a
pinkishwhite
but
retention
was
much
lower
in
this
case
color
was
a
deeper
reddishamber
but
not
as
hazy
as
from
a
bottle
nose
was
still
filled
with
raspberry
but
not
as
cloying
as
from
a
bottle
mouthfeel
was
about
the
same
slightly
on
the
thin
side
the
taste
was
not
as
prevalent
as
from
a
bottle
more
muted
finish
also
lacked
some
of
the
oomph
that
the
bottle
imparted
bottom
line
if
somewhere
that
both
are
available
go
for
bottle
or
draft
but
if
hiking
camping
going
to
the
beach
reach
for
the
canned
version
that
or
if
they
begin
putting
fresh
puree
in
cans
then
it
will
render
the
point
moot
overall
i
bought
a
pint
just
to
review
it
and
honestly
not
worth
my
time
nor
yours
it
looks
good
taste
maybe
alright
but
i
have
had
much
better
from
abita
not
to
mention
better
fruit
beers
salud
the
body
is
good
smooth
easy
clean
and
nicely
carbonated
but
as
stickysweet
as
you
might
expect
drinkability
is
very
good
to
excellent
you
could
and
i
have
drink
these
all
day
long
on
a
sunny
summers
day
overall
a
very
nice
brew
when
your
in
the
mood
for
a
light
refreshing
brew
worth
your
time
overall
this
basically
reminds
me
of
a
weak
version
of
leinenkugels
berry
weiss
im
not
impressed
taste
is
of
raspberry
and
malty
wheat
its
a
bit
artificial
for
me
but
its
not
horrible
glad
to
try
but
i
dont
get
the
hype
its
not
that
good
i
prob
wont
get
again
o
a
decent
summertime
brew
the
raspberry
flavor
seems
too
artificial
and
sweetened
regardless
id
drink
another
one
overall
a
nice
beer
fairly
refreshing
but
not
one
i
plan
on
having
routinely
ive
had
this
in
a
bottle
and
on
tap
i
prefer
it
on
tap
but
not
bad
either
way
its
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
i
dont
think
that
its
overly
fruity
at
all
and
dont
really
find
that
it
has
a
distinct
raspberry
aroma
its
not
at
all
bitter
and
on
the
whole
very
enjoyable
d
a
very
average
fruit
beer
not
complex
decent
sessionability
due
to
its
low
abv
an
average
fruity
wheat
beer
o
interesting
combination
of
smells
and
tastes
good
summer
beer
initially
the
taste
was
amazing
sweet
raspberries
are
upfront
but
then
they
fade
to
the
dirty
flavors
that
ive
come
to
hate
with
american
wheat
pale
ales
its
almost
like
bl
bud
heavy
and
mgd
it
does
so
well
then
it
loses
it
when
those
awful
flavors
come
through
wish
they
didnt
have
it
because
it
would
be
in
the
realm
of
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
good
in
context
o
fruit
beers
are
just
not
my
thing
i
should
know
better
t
very
clean
the
raspberries
come
through
on
your
tongue
but
not
overwhelming
like
most
of
the
other
fruit
beers
out
there
trying
to
use
this
fruit
very
tasty
a
pretty
solid
beer
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
but
be
warned
that
it
is
pretty
fruity
pours
golden
with
a
white
head
the
beer
is
slightly
cloudy
due
to
the
raspberry
pulp
the
smell
of
raspberry
comes
through
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
wheat
the
raspberry
flavor
is
not
too
sweet
there
are
flavors
of
wheat
the
hops
arent
very
pronounced
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
its
a
refreshingly
good
beer
d
easy
to
drink
but
then
there
is
not
much
there
everything
is
rather
minimal
insipid
sort
of
a
yawn
i
remember
it
being
better
on
tap
down
south
more
fruity
raspberry
and
more
wheat
character
maybe
it
needs
to
be
fresh
are
they
changing
it
for
stability
in
the
mixed
packs
o
purple
haze
just
simply
doesnt
cut
it
in
the
flavor
department
its
not
all
that
focused
served
in
a
pint
glass
brew
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
light
mist
of
semifiltered
haze
nose
is
bright
and
crisp
with
the
promise
of
a
refreshing
fruit
taste
raspberry
fruit
flavor
shines
through
nicely
in
a
zesty
sweet
and
tart
feel
carbonation
really
quenches
the
palate
up
to
a
lightly
sticky
earthy
raspberry
finish
something
id
love
to
try
pairing
with
a
goat
cheese
salad
andor
grilled
gulf
shrimp
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
could
go
for
a
little
more
hops
or
so
as
it
tasted
a
little
watery
but
the
wheat
really
stood
out
in
this
beer
this
is
not
that
bearable
im
on
my
second
and
struggling
i
will
win
this
glass
but
at
a
price
somebody
pour
me
a
yuengling
please
o
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
i
used
to
drink
alot
of
this
back
when
i
bowled
in
the
pregaming
sessions
you
can
do
worse
but
you
can
also
do
quite
better
overall
i
really
dont
understand
the
name
of
this
beer
the
raspberries
are
barely
discernible
if
you
want
an
extremely
light
flavored
fruit
beer
this
is
for
you
to
me
this
beer
is
an
excellent
choice
for
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
different
tasting
beer
for
a
change
the
name
of
this
beer
says
it
all
the
look
of
it
is
a
faint
yellow
with
decent
head
the
taste
is
that
of
faint
grape
mixed
with
other
fruit
and
the
smell
is
fruity
overall
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
good
for
a
6pack
night
drinking
with
friends
a
light
very
drinkable
but
flavorful
beer
nose
is
raspberries
with
some
biscuity
malt
very
clean
lager
taste
w
the
raspberries
offering
a
notatall
overpowering
tartness
faint
bit
of
spiciness
from
the
hops
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
balanced
mostly
by
the
raspberry
tartness
for
what
it
is
a
relatively
light
american
lager
i
cant
think
of
many
other
beers
id
prefer
to
drink
when
thats
what
im
looking
for
its
real
raspberries
not
some
nasty
flavoring
and
its
executed
extremely
well
if
it
werent
for
the
price
id
buy
this
a
lot
more
often
as
a
solid
session
beer
o
a
perfect
summer
beer
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
probably
enjoy
this
on
a
regular
basis
would
love
to
see
this
in
my
area
as
its
well
balanced
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
good
and
there
is
a
freshness
about
it
that
puts
it
in
its
own
class
amongst
fruit
beers
nothing
artificial
tasting
about
this
one
great
job
to
abita
overall
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
flavor
wise
its
a
pretty
crisp
and
sweet
beer
you
can
taste
the
fruit
juice
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
kind
of
like
that
aspect
of
it
the
fruit
juice
comes
in
near
the
end
and
it
has
a
sort
of
dry
finish
i
dont
really
like
the
amount
of
carbonation
it
has
but
its
not
too
bad
theres
no
distinctive
hop
or
malt
character
though
i
dont
usually
like
fruity
beers
especially
ones
involving
raspberries
in
fact
only
apricots
are
a
fruit
that
i
liked
in
my
beer
purple
haze
is
a
little
different
i
had
it
a
while
ago
and
still
remember
the
name
i
finally
found
a
place
that
carried
it
in
bottles
the
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
the
taste
is
perfectly
mixed
with
a
beer
and
raspberries
its
not
overbearing
and
does
not
leave
you
with
a
fowl
aftertaste
its
even
good
at
room
temperature
definitely
recommend
this
brew
pours
light
slightly
darker
than
straw
color
small
bright
white
head
adorns
aroma
is
bready
malts
and
a
tinge
of
fruitiness
you
get
the
raspberries
on
the
taste
more
than
the
aroma
which
adds
a
slightly
sugary
sweetness
over
biscuity
wheat
very
light
in
body
crisp
its
a
fruit
beer
what
can
i
say
i
always
drink
these
last
when
i
get
a
party
pack
its
a
good
fruit
beer
overall
like
a
magic
hat
but
with
raspberry
instead
of
apricot
overall
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
it
doesnt
taste
artificial
like
many
fruit
beers
but
the
balance
just
seems
a
bit
off
o
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
had
hands
down
and
at
a
price
that
cant
be
beat
overall
it
is
sort
of
boring
despite
the
awesome
raspberry
flavor
it
just
needs
to
beef
up
the
nose
and
the
raspberry
profile
on
the
tongue
could
be
better
good
carbonation
light
feel
overall
it
wasnt
terrible
but
definitely
not
something
i
would
want
to
try
again
unless
i
was
perhaps
having
it
as
a
soda
rather
than
a
beer
yeah
this
is
a
needless
and
pointless
fruit
beer
it
doesnt
help
that
its
a
very
bland
and
rather
unpleasant
base
beer
but
the
fruit
addition
makes
it
even
worse
it
feels
senseless
and
cynical
very
unimpressed
d
ehhh
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
it
being
but
really
not
one
worth
getting
again
again
or
ever
again
for
that
matter
an
alright
fruit
beer
with
no
bells
no
whistles
overall
not
the
monster
people
seem
to
make
it
out
to
be
but
really
not
that
great
either
its
below
average
for
fruit
beers
but
not
particularly
offensive
meh
i
have
also
had
it
on
tap
and
i
recall
enjoying
that
even
more
but
this
review
is
for
the
bottle
version
i
have
at
hand
o
good
for
the
style
i
guess
however
its
a
bit
to
much
like
wine
cooler
or
somthing
for
me
refreshing
nonetheless
odthe
whole
purple
haze
thing
turned
me
off
from
this
beer
but
once
i
found
out
it
was
a
raspberry
beer
i
needed
to
try
it
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
lot
it
was
8
at
my
local
store
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
with
each
sip
catches
some
flak
but
i
am
a
fan
love
those
raspberries
not
as
good
as
blackbeary
wheat
by
longtrail
however
b
3
7
cons
dont
have
space
for
all
but
the
fact
i
will
pass
it
by
next
time
too
thin
and
one
dimensional
definitely
not
for
me
call
me
a
sissy
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
while
the
heat
is
on
o
this
brew
is
certainly
not
of
great
craft
beer
caliber
but
is
a
fun
drink
and
a
pleasant
experience
though
not
for
the
beer
aficionado
expecting
a
premium
complex
craft
beer
the
color
fits
the
name
purple
haze
a
nice
hazy
raspberry
color
its
a
nice
crisp
beer
with
a
sligght
sweettart
flavor
it
is
not
overly
sweet
or
artificial
tasting
its
a
great
lighter
beer
that
fits
in
well
with
the
hothumid
louisiana
climate
rjt
nice
name
though
i
like
the
concept
but
it
was
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
highly
recommended
for
those
looking
for
a
strong
fruit
taste
honestly
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
not
my
favorite
but
thumbs
up
this
is
a
beer
my
fruit
beer
loving
wife
enjoys
as
for
me
it
is
okay
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
particularly
good
one
lets
call
it
an
average
beer
with
a
great
name
overall
not
very
good
as
beer
goes
im
not
completely
sold
on
this
one
mind
you
but
im
willing
to
admit
that
it
wasnt
anywhere
near
as
cloyingly
nastily
awful
as
i
was
expecting
and
in
fact
would
go
over
fairly
well
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
beer
float
anyone
the
rest
a
decent
fruit
beer
that
is
pretty
light
and
crisp
with
a
body
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
the
aroma
however
is
a
bit
offputting
which
lowers
the
overall
rating
of
this
beer
d
very
unique
taste
in
a
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
several
times
and
would
drink
again
o
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
not
what
i
expected
it
was
just
too
bland
great
for
a
session
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
will
not
be
a
regular
for
me
and
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
anytime
soon
maybe
for
a
back
yard
summer
party
where
im
gonna
be
drinking
for
several
hours
poured
into
my
zero
gravity
pilsner
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
definite
pinkpurplish
tint
and
a
small
offwhite
head
nose
of
grains
wheat
and
coexisting
citrus
zest
and
raspberry
light
wheat
beer
profile
on
the
taste
buds
with
a
raspberry
sweetness
thats
just
strong
enough
to
overtake
everything
else
that
might
be
present
light
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
on
a
relaxing
summer
day
the
beer
is
a
murky
dark
yellow
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
beer
and
head
had
a
very
light
lavender
tint
it
left
a
lot
of
lacing
too
the
aroma
is
faint
with
wheat
bread
and
just
a
hint
of
raspberry
it
tastes
a
little
bland
to
be
honest
but
i
did
pick
up
mostly
wheat
with
a
slight
tartness
of
raspberry
with
a
bready
finish
the
beer
is
light
fully
carbonated
and
has
a
dry
finish
this
is
just
a
little
above
your
average
wheat
beer
with
a
little
twist
to
it
a
slight
twist
but
still
a
twist
o
this
is
a
halfway
decent
beer
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
brew
that
i
can
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
color
of
purple
haze
is
right
in
line
with
its
name
a
hazy
purplish
which
i
find
pretty
nice
the
smell
is
slightly
citrus
and
fruity
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
but
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
over
all
this
is
a
really
drinkable
and
unique
beer
mo
the
beer
has
a
great
balance
and
is
very
crisp
and
drinkable
its
perfect
for
a
hot
day
these
beers
are
tough
because
the
question
is
whether
its
artificial
flavor
or
too
overpowering
this
really
walks
the
line
of
being
a
drinkable
beer
that
has
real
flavor
and
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
nose
with
it
overall
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
easy
to
drink
if
youre
into
a
fruit
beer
the
tartness
make
it
kind
of
a
quencher
purple
haze
had
to
be
one
of
the
first
fruit
beers
id
ever
tried
this
beer
was
the
bottled
list
at
the
kaystone
pub
a
while
back
when
i
was
just
starting
to
explore
the
beer
world
the
reason
why
i
bought
it
was
because
the
name
made
me
think
of
jimi
hendrixs
song
so
without
hesitation
i
got
one
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
the
head
was
fluffy
at
first
before
it
vanished
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
and
had
a
good
amount
of
raspberry
aromas
in
there
the
taste
i
found
to
be
a
little
on
the
light
side
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
was
hoping
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
fairly
refreshing
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
gateway
beer
for
me
it
gave
me
an
idea
of
what
a
fruit
beer
was
and
shed
some
light
on
the
style
it
was
obvious
it
was
some
attempt
at
a
sort
of
fruit
beer
but
i
had
no
idea
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
wheatraspberry
fruit
beer
until
i
read
through
a
few
these
purple
haze
reviews
just
now
this
beer
is
quite
liked
by
a
couple
people
i
know
and
its
definitely
got
a
niche
it
fills
pretty
drinkable
great
summer
beer
o
ive
had
worse
but
i
really
dont
enjoy
this
beer
i
could
see
it
being
a
good
lawnmower
beer
or
going
good
with
fried
foods
honestly
theres
better
choices
out
there
for
that
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
beer
cocktail
or
a
beer
and
soda
but
not
a
bad
beer
and
definitely
nothing
wrong
with
it
imho
contrary
to
my
initial
belief
theres
no
homage
to
jimi
hendrix
here
nor
is
there
an
incorporation
of
marijuana
not
that
i
can
tell
yet
anyway
what
it
does
have
is
raspberries
i
never
read
the
label
i
just
drank
it
and
i
liked
it
for
a
fruit
beer
this
one
fills
niche
quite
nicely
now
excuse
me
while
i
kiss
the
sky
o
something
i
wanted
to
try
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
6er
but
was
offered
one
at
a
friends
house
will
not
really
search
it
out
again
i
do
like
abitas
other
offerings
but
this
is
just
not
one
fore
me
d
while
i
could
probably
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
or
afternoon
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
beer
back
to
back
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
but
a
nice
end
or
start
to
the
night
o
over
the
years
this
beer
has
been
surpassed
by
many
others
but
kudos
to
abita
brewing
for
continuing
to
make
this
beer
consistently
good
and
even
after
the
rebuild
of
katrina
ill
always
look
foward
to
some
purple
haze
geaux
abita
not
the
worlds
best
beer
but
by
no
means
a
slouch
much
better
than
the
shocktop
rasberry
wheat
that
is
being
marketed
as
its
competition
a
cloudy
beer
more
the
color
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
wheat
with
light
purplish
hues
decent
head
and
a
touch
of
lace
here
and
there
smell
is
tar
and
wheaty
with
a
wonderful
rasberry
scent
taste
dry
and
grainy
with
a
delectable
berry
tartness
very
crisp
feel
with
spot
on
carbonation
and
medium
light
weight
a
great
fruit
beer
usually
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
is
a
highly
quaffable
and
enjoyable
beer
top
notch
overall
enjoyable
beer
its
funny
because
the
last
few
fruitveggie
beers
ive
had
the
aroma
is
huge
with
flavor
and
whatever
fruit
is
being
used
but
in
this
one
the
raspberry
comes
through
as
the
dominant
attribute
could
drink
easily
more
than
4
but
like
always
going
to
move
on
to
new
and
more
interesting
beers
o
i
enjoy
well
done
fruited
brews
and
purple
haze
falls
just
short
a
very
disappointing
brew
it
doesnt
quite
know
what
it
wants
to
be
a
sour
or
a
reserved
raspberry
palelager
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
in
the
future
not
a
drain
pour
but
nothing
to
remember
my
buddy
mike
also
a
huge
beer
geek
thought
it
sucked
but
within
its
style
this
is
pretty
good
not
something
i
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
this
is
good
i
would
find
it
hard
to
have
a
session
with
this
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
thin
and
watery
with
decent
carbonation
so
far
nobody
has
made
a
raspberry
beer
as
good
as
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
this
beer
pales
in
comparison
which
is
too
bad
this
beer
pours
a
pinkish
yellow
reminiscent
of
a
pink
grapefruit
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
has
hints
of
wheat
and
citrus
with
a
tiny
bit
of
raspberry
showing
through
the
flavor
is
like
bubble
gum
with
a
tart
raspberry
note
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
abita
purple
haze
is
an
okay
beer
slightly
recommended
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
hazy
blood
tinged
gold
that
is
almost
opaque
the
pour
starts
out
with
a
huge
robust
three
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
quickly
into
a
thin
film
initial
aromas
are
very
similar
to
a
framboise
lambic
with
very
tart
and
sugary
raspberry
smells
but
they
are
balanced
with
wheat
aromas
as
well
with
some
toasted
cereal
characteristics
cutting
the
sweet
towards
the
end
smell
is
a
bit
strong
and
a
tad
sour
with
the
tart
sharp
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
cuts
the
raspberry
and
wheat
flavors
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
but
the
tartness
does
come
through
strong
there
is
a
light
fruit
sweetness
to
the
aftertaste
with
a
filmy
and
clingy
finish
the
increased
carbonation
makes
the
beer
a
little
on
the
sharp
side
but
the
flavors
are
light
compared
to
how
strong
the
aromas
were
to
start
interesting
blend
of
flavors
but
balance
gets
a
little
out
of
whack
at
times
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
wheat
like
notes
and
kind
of
like
asiago
cheese
in
the
taste
dry
wheat
notes
and
a
small
fruit
note
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
wheat
and
small
hint
of
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
kind
of
icky
with
a
bad
aroma
and
really
lacking
in
fruit
presence
enjoy
poured
into
pint
glass
has
a
cloudy
grapefruit
color
with
one
finger
of
foam
that
quickly
disappears
smells
of
raspberry
tartness
and
wheat
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
raspberrys
upfront
then
turns
to
a
wheat
beer
mouthfeel
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
texture
overall
a
delicious
beer
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
its
certainly
not
great
i
do
like
that
theyre
experimenting
with
fruits
at
abita
overall
one
of
the
most
boring
beers
ever
if
someone
gave
you
a
blind
taste
test
youd
think
this
was
vitamin
water
o
this
beer
is
incredibly
misleading
it
smells
and
looks
great
but
it
doesnt
deliver
in
any
other
areas
probably
wont
drink
again
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
but
smooth
and
goes
down
with
a
nice
easy
drinkable
feel
very
good
d
solid
nothing
spectacular
you
could
do
worse
nice
summer
and
newbie
beer
the
ladies
may
enjoy
the
sweetness
overall
i
had
this
a
few
months
ago
and
forgot
to
review
i
definitely
liked
it
m
drink
this
one
with
food
pairing
difficult
to
drink
quickly
or
a
large
amount
you
will
become
overwhelmed
this
is
a
decent
american
wheat
beer
good
for
hotter
temps
and
can
be
served
cold

bought
as
a
single
at
world
market
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
whitelight
pink
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
ok
aroma
is
sweet
raspberries
and
wheat
taste
is
mostly
wheat
and
bready
malt
with
some
raspberries
however
the
raspberry
flavor
isnt
nearly
as
strong
as
i
thought
it
would
be
mouthfeelbody
is
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
its
a
slightly
above
average
beer
but
i
wasnt
impressed
with
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
to
have
on
a
hot
day
i
expected
this
to
be
kind
of
a
sweet
mess
but
i
was
definitely
wrong
straightforward
and
nicely
balanced
d
very
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
quick
would
be
great
in
the
summer
drinkability
i
first
sampled
this
beer
and
tried
it
later
on
based
on
the
sample
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
as
it
was
not
too
heavy
and
had
a
good
flavor
then
again
this
kind
of
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
very
light
and
actually
kindof
watery
some
good
carbonation
a
bit
of
the
malt
hangs
around
for
a
relatively
clean
finish
certainly
very
easy
to
drink
and
for
the
audience
to
whom
it
is
targeted
i
bet
it
goes
over
well
but
hardly
the
kind
of
thing
i
would
put
much
stock
in
not
really
for
the
average
ba
im
guessing
poured
a
cloudy
pinkishyellow
with
a
small
white
fizzy
head
that
was
fully
diminishing
and
had
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
very
weak
with
notes
of
bread
malts
a
doughy
yeast
and
a
slight
hint
of
raspberry
it
tasted
lightly
sweet
with
a
mild
acidic
characteristic
from
start
to
finish
and
had
a
slight
hint
of
raspberry
at
the
end
with
the
flavor
disappearing
from
the
taste
buds
almost
immediately
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
the
carbonation
being
quite
lively
overall
a
nice
light
refreshing
brew
with
a
just
a
bit
of
raspberry
flavor
great
on
those
hot
summer
days
when
you
feel
like
having
more
than
just
a
few
drinkability
i
suppose
i
might
try
this
beer
again
under
the
right
circumstances
but
there
was
nothing
in
particular
about
it
that
stood
out
it
was
easy
to
drink
in
the
same
way
that
flavored
water
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
guess
i
might
buy
it
again
to
satisfy
someone
who
likes
just
a
hint
of
flavor
in
thin
watery
beer
i
wont
be
buying
it
for
myself
though
the
cpj
opinion
well
im
not
as
big
of
a
fan
of
this
particular
beer
as
my
brother
is
but
to
each
their
own
he
doesnt
care
for
korbinian
so
we
are
different
individuals
that
said
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
from
abita
their
amber
rocks
when
you
are
in
new
orleans
and
i
have
had
some
good
beer
at
their
brewpubcafe
in
abita
springs
but
as
a
regular
offering
this
is
one
of
their
better
ones
and
worth
a
shot
d
i
know
ive
mentioned
it
a
couple
times
already
but
the
taste
is
weird
its
definitely
not
my
cup
of
beer
in
any
shape
or
form
finally
the
taste
was
described
as
wheaty
and
fruity
in
taste
that
fades
to
a
tangy
raspberry
taste
a
cloudy
gold
to
orange
color
with
very
little
head
when
poured
not
seeing
any
purple
here
scent
was
definitely
raspberry
taste
was
clearly
raspberry
but
not
overpowering
a
pretty
well
balanced
fruit
beer
nothing
outstanding
about
this
one
but
nothing
offensive
either
drinkability
i
can
certainly
see
myself
drinking
this
cold
during
summer
and
maybe
spring
but
certainly
not
during
winter
i
think
abitas
has
a
done
a
good
job
creating
a
decent
fruit
beer
with
actual
raspberries
instead
of
artificial
flavoring
i
probably
wont
touch
my
other
bottles
until
the
va
humidity
and
heat
roll
in
around
may
or
so
d
the
beer
is
definitely
very
easy
to
drink
although
i
wouldnt
call
it
particularly
thirst
quenching
poured
into
a
common
bar
pint
interesting
amber
color
with
a
golden
and
red
smells
of
sweet
fruits
tastes
of
cranberry
and
raspberry
cocktail
involved
with
a
wheat
beer
the
fruit
is
not
overpowering
and
for
a
fruity
beer
i
would
say
this
is
among
the
better
ive
had
it
shows
a
light
body
with
a
stringent
syrpy
feel
and
small
carbonation
i
would
recommend
this
to
your
old
lady
or
sister
the
taste
follows
the
nose
initially
and
begins
pleasant
but
soon
becomes
overpowering
and
sickly
sweetfruity
the
nice
wheat
base
malt
is
completely
lost
amongst
the
sweetsour
berry
flavors
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
white
wine
mixed
with
raspberries
really
awful
actually
the
best
way
to
describe
this
is
a
good
wheat
beer
with
raspberry
juice
and
confectionery
sugar
added
gross
overall
this
may
be
tolerable
in
the
heat
of
summer
but
not
in
the
middle
of
the
february
during
worst
winter
in
recent
memory
ive
had
good
fruit
beers
and
this
is
not
one
d
if
i
was
in
an
easy
drinking
mood
and
didnt
want
to
much
going
on
in
my
beer
this
would
be
excellent
good
thirst
quencher
here
abita
is
a
great
company
that
not
a
lot
of
people
know
about
no
one
would
think
louisiana
would
produce
a
quality
beer
in
my
opinion
purple
haze
has
a
flirty
tint
to
its
color
and
it
is
great
for
fruit
whit
and
wheat
lovers
alady
that
is
new
to
the
beer
world
would
love
this
as
her
first
try
especially
since
i
try
to
get
people
to
try
something
other
than
blue
moon
however
i
do
like
it
overall
i
might
have
gotten
a
dirty
hose
but
im
not
impressed
poured
a
golden
in
color
with
some
haze
in
the
glass
and
a
head
that
diminished
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
smell
is
predominately
raspberry
tart
light
yeast
and
wheat
taste
is
better
than
i
would
have
thought
comes
over
the
tongue
on
the
thin
side
light
flavor
of
malts
and
mid
taste
yeast
and
finishes
with
a
raspberry
tart
flavor
does
not
have
the
artificial
taste
or
smell
that
a
lot
of
these
do
i
give
them
points
on
the
raspberry
puree
best
drank
right
after
it
is
poured
almost
like
a
light
lambic
d
this
beer
is
good
cold
i
know
that
sounds
stupid
as
it
mutes
the
flavors
once
it
warms
the
beer
takes
on
a
different
not
really
good
flavor
abv
is
low
to
make
it
more
sessionable
but
they
need
to
work
on
the
overall
flavor
more
i
think
served
in
a
plain
glass
it
boasted
a
two
finger
head
of
fluffy
foam
with
good
lace
cling
color
was
a
reddish
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
haze
to
appearance
smell
of
raspberries
apple
and
malt
taste
of
raspberries
caramel
molasses
apple
and
malt
good
texture
and
body
in
my
mouth
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
one
after
another
a
little
to
sweet
and
fruity
but
one
was
great
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
for
how
subdued
the
brew
is
but
is
otherwise
alright
and
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
the
simplicity
makes
them
easy
to
kick
back
this
is
just
about
an
average
beer
sam
adams
blackberry
witbier
does
everything
this
does
better
but
its
still
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
good
not
great
purple
haze
is
a
little
too
bland
for
those
who
enjoy
a
lot
of
flavor
but
the
light
body
and
refreshing
qualities
would
make
drinking
a
few
a
breeze
say
whatever
you
want
about
this
beer
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
offering
from
abita
d
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
a
more
drinkable
brew
also
there
are
a
number
of
beer
mixes
which
some
people
love
and
purple
haze
is
typically
on
that
list
poured
my
bottle
into
a
mug
next
to
nothing
for
head
but
what
was
there
was
white
the
smell
was
breadhaylike
with
a
tinge
of
fruit
the
taste
was
fair
at
best
the
wheat
and
raspberry
tastes
were
both
very
muted
their
was
no
bitterness
but
has
a
slight
sour
taste
at
the
end
of
drink
it
is
easy
drinking
but
thats
because
it
seems
watered
down
33
53
533
it
did
have
a
light
fresh
taste
and
due
to
it
being
a
light
beer
you
could
drink
more
than
one
easily
if
you
can
stand
fruit
beers
d
if
you
like
raspberries
then
its
easy
to
drink
this
was
hard
to
grade
was
it
a
good
beer
no
was
it
a
good
beer
for
people
that
dont
like
beer
yes
it
was
also
a
good
raspberry
drink
looks
like
a
darkish
amber
wheat
beer
with
a
touch
of
purple
big
surprise
smells
strongly
of
raspberries
and
some
malt
taste
is
somewhat
disappointing
as
the
raspberry
taste
is
lighter
than
expected
and
the
beer
flavor
is
very
weak
mouthfeel
is
light
but
has
an
almost
tingly
finish
i
could
probably
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
as
long
as
i
had
something
else
to
break
them
up
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
d
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
my
girlfriend
who
hates
beer
thought
that
its
not
bad
that
should
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
its
definitely
a
beer
i
would
like
to
have
and
enjoy
again
amber
and
hazy
a
quickly
dying
head
with
no
retention
little
to
no
lace
rapsberry
predominates
the
aroma
carbonation
bite
up
front
rapsberry
comes
next
followed
by
a
flat
middle
adjunct
grain
popcorn
finish
too
heavy
a
mouthfeel
for
the
style
almost
chewy
light
bodied
soda
like
carbonation
and
a
clean
aftertaste
it
could
certainly
be
refreshing
down
in
the
bayou
but
for
now
im
good
with
one
12
ounce
stubby
bottle
gotta
love
the
jimi
hendrix
reference
lets
see
if
this
beer
can
stand
up
to
my
love
of
all
things
hendrix
pours
a
flat
and
hazy
straw
yellow
with
no
head
hmm
not
a
great
start
aroma
is
subtle
like
raspberry
compote
mixed
with
some
basic
lager
beer
initial
impression
of
the
taste
is
strange
lots
of
wheat
character
in
this
almost
like
drinking
raw
wheat
very
little
raspberry
character
in
this
its
overpowered
by
the
wheat
ive
had
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
and
hefeweisens
over
the
years
but
this
one
may
have
the
most
wheat
character
of
any
that
ive
had
and
if
you
like
wheat
beers
this
one
may
be
your
thing
because
its
like
chewing
on
raw
what
i
however
am
not
a
fan
it
finishes
clean
berried
and
sweet
with
some
tartness
its
as
drinkable
as
any
other
beer
of
its
style
just
mostly
indistinct
from
the
others
most
likely
wouldnt
pick
up
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
i
have
been
converted
one
of
the
things
that
i
have
always
thought
is
that
fruit
and
beer
fight
rather
than
complement
each
other
this
beer
has
proven
to
me
that
exactly
the
opposite
can
be
true
quite
drinkable
and
quite
accessible
to
the
average
consumer
since
the
beer
is
not
so
extreme
not
the
most
interesting
beer
out
there
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
too
bad
smooth
drinkable
and
refreshing
minor
revision
with
new
overall
rating
on
5711
a
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
overall
an
ok
beer
not
great
but
drinkable
due
to
the
low
abv
and
the
taste
is
not
offensive
d
final
thoughts
would
recommend
but
would
probably
not
buy
again
ordered
at
a
favorite
local
restaurant
dining
outside
on
a
hot
humid
evening
was
looking
for
something
light
and
refreshing
i
felt
a
little
cheated
with
this
one
tastes
like
a
malt
beverage
pretending
to
be
a
craft
beer
avoid
poured
with
disappearing
head
there
was
a
faint
pinkpurple
tint
to
the
hazy
beer
and
the
raspberry
flavor
was
very
authentic
it
didnt
taste
like
an
artificial
additive
or
preservative
the
beer
had
a
lightish
flavor
and
with
the
subtle
fruit
flavor
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
it
actually
did
pour
a
slight
purple
hue
but
was
mostly
golden
with
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
a
little
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
on
the
nose
i
got
the
raspberry
aromas
right
away
along
with
grain
and
wheaty
bready
notes
pretty
basic
but
fruity
upront
the
raspberries
dominate
the
palate
and
also
came
with
grainy
and
wheat
accents
like
the
nose
the
brew
was
light
bodied
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
fruity
grainy
crisp
finish
and
was
quite
enjoyable
it
drank
very
good
and
was
really
good
paired
with
some
southern
style
bbq
drinkability
almost
like
drinking
a
fruit
drink
that
has
been
watered
down
its
easy
to
put
down
but
ehh
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
its
not
my
favorite
but
i
enjoy
it
every
once
in
awhile
abita
purple
haze
pours
a
light
light
hazed
whitish
yellow
a
very
small
head
is
present
but
seems
to
be
hanging
out
for
a
long
time
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
huge
it
almost
smells
like
welchs
juice
the
first
sip
is
like
biting
into
a
raspberry
filled
jelly
doughnut
the
wheat
is
present
only
on
the
finish
by
scratching
the
back
of
my
tongue
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
its
not
too
sweet
but
seems
more
like
something
to
have
with
breakfast
if
breakfast
is
too
early
for
you
on
your
days
off
of
course
maybe
with
some
cheese
cake
topped
with
fresh
raspberries
after
dinner
im
was
going
to
rate
this
beer
a
solid
b
but
it
seemed
to
become
flat
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
so
my
rating
is
a
middle
of
the
road
c
hazy
gold
beer
that
has
some
carbonation
bubbles
with
a
medium
head
that
lingers
for
the
drink
smell
is
rich
in
rasberry
not
much
else
the
taste
is
like
fruit
juice
its
definitely
rasberry
heavy
pretty
smooth
little
carbonation
bite
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
its
a
light
beer
that
tastes
like
a
fruit
drink
its
not
bad
but
just
not
for
me
this
has
so
much
promise
and
just
fell
flat
on
its
face
on
the
first
sip
many
friends
have
warned
me
that
abita
brews
unremarkable
beers
and
i
have
now
experienced
it
for
myself
overall
not
a
bad
drink
to
get
ppl
interested
in
craft
beers
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
not
beer
well
since
im
from
louisiana
i
have
to
show
a
little
bit
of
favoritism
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
1
5
to
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
at
a
leisurely
pace
if
you
smell
the
beer
before
you
try
it
the
first
thing
you
will
notice
before
you
bring
the
rim
of
the
glass
up
to
your
nose
is
the
raspberry
aroma
of
the
beer
but
at
first
sip
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
obvious
as
the
smell
this
beer
does
have
a
fruity
raspberry
taste
but
not
enough
to
rule
out
that
youre
still
drinking
a
beer
it
has
mild
hoppyness
and
mild
carbonation
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
louisiana
summer
overall
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
something
different
most
people
i
have
asked
say
they
dont
like
this
beer
but
i
just
tell
them
theyre
crazy
because
i
honestly
think
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
stumbled
upon
for
some
time
now
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
fruit
beer
its
actually
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
drinkability
i
dont
really
understand
why
this
beer
is
reviewed
so
badly
i
dont
think
its
that
bad
this
isnt
something
i
would
go
for
all
the
time
but
id
be
willing
to
have
it
again
if
nothing
else
this
would
make
for
a
great
refresher
to
have
in
the
fridge
d
real
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
to
make
it
a
repeat
overall
probably
not
something
ill
buy
again
just
goes
to
further
reinforce
my
dislike
of
fruit
beers
i
can
see
how
the
bmc
crowd
might
enjoy
this
one
but
its
not
for
me
it
almost
came
off
as
a
pale
ale
with
the
nice
wheat
taste
but
it
all
worked
together
very
nicely
im
definitely
adding
this
one
to
my
faves
probably
better
on
tap
because
this
one
was
good
and
ive
remembered
drinking
some
of
these
that
have
not
been
memorable
to
say
the
least
pours
a
hazy
grapefruit
like
color
with
a
one
finger
frothy
head
which
gives
way
to
nothing
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
raspberries
with
a
slight
floral
note
there
is
really
nothing
else
to
smell
the
smell
is
inviting
though
the
taste
is
of
tart
raspberries
but
it
is
kinda
weak
and
very
subtle
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
more
present
there
is
a
hint
of
a
wheat
backbone
the
carbonation
is
lighter
the
drinkability
is
okay
there
is
nothing
to
dislike
but
i
cant
say
there
is
anything
to
make
me
want
more
overall
im
not
sure
i
would
pick
this
up
again
but
i
know
some
people
that
may
love
it
its
certainly
drinkable
and
would
not
refuse
it
when
offered
one
but
not
what
im
personally
looking
for
notes
one
of
the
best
fruited
wheats
that
ive
ever
had
really
well
done
crisp
clean
and
tasty
i
still
cant
get
over
the
crap
floating
around
in
there
something
aint
right
yep
this
is
pretty
much
similar
to
no
9
in
terms
of
appeal
to
a
specific
audience
perhaps
nonbeer
lovers
not
horrible
but
i
could
find
a
local
example
thats
much
better
and
slightly
different
in
style
at
vt
pub
and
brewery
still
not
a
bad
thing
to
quaff
if
you
dont
feel
like
impressing
your
taste
buds
slightly
watery
feel
up
front
warming
in
the
throat
a
light
effervescence
lightish
body
poured
with
a
great
huge
white
foamy
frothy
fluffy
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
hazy
amber
aroma
is
weird
raspberry
and
skunk
got
this
at
a
quick
mart
type
store
and
even
given
the
brown
glass
who
knows
how
this
beer
was
stored
but
by
the
time
i
got
to
drink
it
it
had
warmed
a
bit
and
i
cant
imagine
how
that
improved
my
experience
flavor
was
similar
to
aroma
body
is
thin
and
carbonation
is
ok
finish
is
like
flavor
and
diminished
by
body
am
looking
for
the
sedative
effect
of
alcohol
right
now
prior
to
my
trip
tomorrow
and
cant
finish
this
beer
wa
d
not
a
terrible
ale
by
any
means
but
i
didnt
finish
it
a
decently
crafted
yet
uninteresting
fruit
beer
ill
pass
in
future
myself
drinking
this
again
drinkability
not
horrible
but
there
isnt
much
going
on
with
this
beer
maybe
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
would
taste
a
little
better
but
so
would
a
miller
lite
d
a
somewhat
refreshing
lowabv
fruit
brew
to
either
liven
up
a
dessert
or
be
a
designated
fruit
beer
during
the
summer
months
a
little
too
tart
to
pair
with
a
lot
of
foods
coming
to
mind
but
as
its
own
fare
its
simplistic
and
good
enough
for
what
it
is
drinkability
3
5
i
could
most
likely
drink
2
or
3
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
there
is
nothing
extrordinary
about
it
to
drink
anything
more
m
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
interesting
flavors
on
their
toes
but
just
an
average
light
ale
otherwise
dextremely
sweet
with
a
nice
light
body
pretty
one
dimensional
but
still
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
bone
white
frothy
head
of
tiny
airy
foam
which
starts
off
over
three
fingers
but
is
gone
before
you
know
it
close
to
zero
lacing
left
behind
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
lots
of
fruit
bits
visibly
floating
within
more
strongly
translucent
than
opaque
while
the
raspberries
are
clear
and
distinct
in
the
nose
overall
the
array
of
scents
are
light
mostly
lemon
peel
light
honey
or
pancake
syrup
generic
malts
not
really
getting
much
wheat
light
to
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
leaden
enough
to
add
weight
rather
than
create
a
lighter
sensation
sweet
comes
mainly
from
the
raspberries
and
again
vague
maltiness
more
wheat
and
field
grasses
here
as
the
mouth
texture
allows
for
added
tactile
dryness
yeastiness
softens
the
finish
some
clean
enough
ending
monochrome
enough
that
theres
not
much
more
to
say
but
easy
drinker
d
very
drinkable
the
scent
didnt
bother
me
at
all
when
i
was
drinking
and
the
alcohol
cant
be
tasted
at
all
solid
session
beer
side
note
does
everyone
love
this
or
berry
weiss
more
the
mouthfeel
of
this
abita
is
pretty
consistent
with
other
brews
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
from
this
brewery
refreshing
light
crisp
and
dry
are
all
adjectives
id
use
to
describe
this
offering
the
drinkability
is
also
fairly
good
if
the
consumer
likes
raspberries
if
not
i
would
wonder
why
one
would
partake
in
this
brew
to
begin
with
d
although
there
isnt
much
to
savor
here
it
certainly
is
refreshing
drinkability
basically
budlight
without
the
corn
aftertaste
with
a
slight
raspberry
flavor
on
the
backend
great
for
summer
beach
drinking
but
far
from
a
flavorful
beer
not
my
kind
of
beer
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
the
flavor
and
the
nose
arent
what
im
looking
for
in
a
raspberry
wheat
drinkability
after
first
sip
i
wanted
to
glug
the
whole
thing
down
of
course
i
had
also
just
come
in
from
working
outside
and
was
thirsty
i
like
the
tartness
of
this
brew
it
reminds
me
of
juice
spritzers
id
definitely
have
it
again
very
good
drinkability
the
raspberry
presence
is
assertive
but
not
overpowering
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
sue
me
i
like
this
beer
its
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
als
brings
back
terrific
memories
both
old
first
craft
beer
sips
and
new
classmate
at
my
20th
hs
reunion
who
knew
i
liked
good
beer
and
bought
some
just
for
me
id
drink
this
all
day
to
be
honest
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
didnt
really
seem
like
i
was
drinking
a
beer
there
was
no
flavor
of
hops
at
all
it
was
very
uninteresting
d
i
would
enjoy
this
one
again
it
is
a
good
beer
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
d
too
sweet
and
becomes
too
flat
too
quickly
to
want
more
than
one
d
not
a
bad
brew
very
sweet
a
pretty
good
raspberry
wheat
beer
one
of
the
better
fruit
wheat
beers
i
have
tried
its
easy
drinking
and
its
got
a
remarkable
wiezeny
body
but
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
tossoff
fruit
beer
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
medium
carbonation
semidry
finish
d
high
with
really
low
abv
and
nice
fruity
taste
not
overwhelming
this
is
obviously
a
well
crafted
beer
but
the
overabundance
of
rasberry
make
it
difficult
for
any
real
flavor
to
come
through
its
very
fruity
and
smooth
its
yummy
to
drink
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
more
and
more
pours
very
hazy
with
a
color
somewhere
between
orange
and
pink
a
small
white
head
up
top
that
quickly
disappears
its
largely
without
aroma
except
for
faint
notes
of
berries
the
berries
come
through
more
prominently
on
the
palate
adding
a
tartness
to
the
sweet
wheat
finishes
clean
nothing
lingers
overall
not
bad
overall
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
though
pales
in
comparison
to
lindemans
framboise
drinkability
not
bad
just
nothing
impressive
this
is
a
good
wheat
beer
with
the
addition
of
raspberries
not
sweet
but
just
the
hint
of
berry
that
is
subtle
enough
to
create
a
nice
taste
it
has
a
good
head
and
decent
lacing
this
beer
is
excellent
served
with
cajun
food
like
jambalaya
gumbo
and
even
with
spanish
paella
it
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
beer
in
a
unsweeten
lambic
style
wheat
is
more
noticeable
on
the
taste
up
front
segueing
to
a
fruitiness
come
midpalate
seems
a
bit
like
fruit
flavored
cereal
at
this
point
finishes
a
bit
watery
but
not
unexpected
given
the
style
and
the
light
abv
and
yet
does
offer
a
slight
coarseness
in
texture
offers
a
decent
and
steady
carbonation
maintaining
a
soft
presence
and
good
drinkability
light
bodied
and
unobtrusive
yet
inspiring
it
is
not
would
be
a
quaffable
accompaniment
to
a
salad
with
dried
cranberries
or
mandarin
oranges
the
smell
has
some
nice
hints
of
some
sort
of
berry
i
cant
quite
place
and
some
wheat
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
the
same
again
the
berry
flavor
backed
by
wheat
although
i
wish
the
berry
made
itself
more
present
if
it
did
it
would
be
a
lot
more
enjoyable
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
it
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
fairly
drinkable
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
drinkability
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
dont
think
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
but
if
presented
to
me
in
the
right
context
say
dining
outdoors
on
a
warm
day
id
be
glad
to
drink
it
again
this
beer
is
probably
better
than
a
c
but
not
by
much
it
pours
a
cloudy
dirty
blonde
hue
there
are
yeasty
particulates
floating
about
if
you
pour
the
entire
bottle
into
the
glass
there
isnt
much
head
to
the
beer
the
nose
has
a
nice
strawberry
and
raspberry
aroma
the
taste
is
a
bit
thin
and
weak
this
tastes
of
an
average
lager
with
some
raspberry
flavors
added
late
in
the
brewing
process
its
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
light
bodied
fruity
sweet
and
just
okay
smooth
not
a
big
aftertaste
some
subtle
notes
no
bitterness
a
little
sour
maybe
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
fruit
in
the
palate
beer
is
thin
fine
stylistically
the
beer
is
unoffensive
but
its
not
very
impressive
just
average
drinkability
is
fine
nothing
special
here
dvery
easy
going
down
nice
summer
beer
chicks
will
dig
it

medium
carbonation
aroma
is
slightyl
malty
with
light
notes
of

and
a

of

flavor
is
quite

mostly

with
a
light
berry
flavor
a
little
wheat
tang
no
bitterness
a
berry
finish
light
body
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
quite
sessionable
but
lacks
any
real
flavor
or
aroma
that
i
am
looking
for
a
fun
try
though
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
wont
even
get
into
drain
pour
md
slightly
overcarbonated
for
a
witbierfruitbeer
feels
more
like
a
crisp
lager
saying
that
it
does
wonders
for
the
drinkability
and
goes
down
as
smooth
as
something
like
the
king
of
beers
aka
budweiser
aka
false
advertising
more
like
pale
orange
haze
doesnt
look
especially
great
but
i
give
it
chance
because
of
the
name
i
expect
a
cloudy
hazy
beer
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
but
the
berry
smell
just
doesnt
fit
it
makes
me
actively
weary
to
taste
it
i
was
right
its
your
average
wheat
beer
with
an
out
of
place
raspberry
taste
that
makes
for
an
unpleasant
tart
it
feels
okay
but
by
this
point
i
just
want
to
finish
it
so
i
can
move
on
to
something
better
overall
its
ok
and
i
would
buy
it
again
especially
considering
its
price
if
only
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
way
overcarbonated
ive
never
been
able
to
drink
two
even
when
i
was
swilling
steele
reserve
between
rugby
matches
i
could
never
finish
more
than
1
of
these
a
little
bonus
for
nostalgias
sake
had
plenty
of
fun
with
purple
haze
in
the
college
days
notes
not
entirely
disappointing
but
quite
a
weak
wheat
fruit
beer
i
feel
and
all
too
often
see
a
prejudice
and
much
sexism
around
the
notion
that
there
are
beers
for
women
and
some
for
men
which
often
ties
fruit
beers
to
females
this
common
marketing
strategy
seems
to
have
worked
and
in
an
unfortunately
male
dominated
beer
culture
that
is
often
the
trite
criticism
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
ladies
will
like
or
not
this
beer
better
than
others
truth
is
that
while
not
horrible
this
is
not
too
great
a
beer
and
lady
or
not
this
is
not
something
that
i
will
be
serving
at
home
to
any
guest
drinkability
not
that
impressed
with
this
one
tastes
too
artificial
go
elsewhere
pours
an
orangish
colored
cloudy
body
with
a
small
whitish
head
diminishing
raspberry
aroma
wheaty
not
too
strong
an
aroma
raspberry
wheat
taste
some
funkiness
in
the
carbonation
almost
tastes
like
soda
water
not
too
fruity
okay
reminds
me
of
a
diet
soda
just
okay
but
a
little
too
much
to
be
refreshing
has
a
taste
to
it
like
mos
of
abitas
beers
maybe
its
the
spring
water
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
different
with
their
beers
its
certainly
refreshing
but
that
is
about
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
an
old
favorite
of
mine
its
easy
to
fine
and
good
to
drinkseveral
its
biggest
weakness
is
that
it
could
stand
to
feel
a
bit
more
loftier
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
it
is
sort
of
light
the
color
is
pretty
good
a
light
golden
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
fine
but
the
razz
part
doesnt
stand
out
great
flavor
though
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
the
beer
looks
a
bit
on
the
lighter
sideand
has
a
smell
that
tricks
one
into
thinking
it
will
taste

about
a
half
inch
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
head
quickly
fizzed
out
to
a
small
bubbly
layer
the
color
is
a
very
cloudy
blondorange
lots
of
sediment
floating
around
the
aroma
is
nice
not
real
strong
but
a
pleasant
balance
of
raspberry
and
yeast
the
taste
is
fruity
raspberry
with
light
malt
the
fruitiness
doesnt
completely
dominate
the
taste
its
a
little
more
subdued
which
is
nice
a
very
small
amount
of
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
end
its
got
a
light
mouthfeel
and
is
real
easy
to
drink
as
fruit
beer
goes
this
one
is
pretty
good
its
a
little
more
balanced
instead
of
just
trying
to
bonk
you
over
the
head
with
fruit
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
modest
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
some
lacing
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
jammy
and
wheat
like
almost
faintly
like
toast
and
jelly
definite
raspberry
flavor
but
weak
and
watery
all
in
all
not
bad
but
definitely
not
great
perhaps
a
good
introduction
to
fruit
beers
for
the
novice
drinker
which
is
probably
why
its
so
popular
at
least
in
my
area
anyway
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
this
style
before
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
at
4

heh
what
a
coincidence
you
could
drink
this
all
night
personally
i
cant
do
wheat
beer
for
an
extended
period
gives
me
a
headache
aside
from
that
i
could
probably
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
the
taste
getting
old
i
could
have
another
of
these
in
the
future
always
saw
this
beer
at
the
store
finally
got
around
to
giving
it
a
purchase

but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
like
it
isnt
overbearing
with
the
fruit
flavor
and
seems
pretty
well
balanced
but
a
but
a
bit
bland
still
an
above
average
fruit
beer
which
isnt
saying
much
giving
the
pretty
crappy
beers
in
this
category
but
solid
none
the
less
this
beer
pours
a
goldentoffee
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
head
that
recedes
to
a
film
that
sticks
around
lots
of
sediment
floating
around
in
this
brew
and
streaky
lacing
coats
the
glass
nose
is
slight
raspberry
wheat
and
some
macro
adjuncts
taste
is
of
adjuncts
up
front
filled
out
by
wheat
in
the
middle
and
a
raspberry
aftertaste
artificial
raspberries
light
body
low
carbonations
somewhat
watery
and
thin
with
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
its
easily
a
poundable
beer
but
there
isnt
much
to
it
for
enjoyment
a
fair
amount
of
thick
dense
fluffy
white
head
a
very
light
straw
color
no
signs
of
true
lacing

raspberries
play
only
a
minor
role
on

the

and

quite
drinkable
in
a
lawnmower

sort
of
way
a
refreshing
beer
but
not
one
i
see
myself
drinking
again
2
75
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
purple
tint
it
was
a
mildly
hoppy
flavor
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
i
enjoyed
it
at
my
favorite
pub
but
i
dont
have
to
have
it
again
im
not
big
on
fruit
wheat
type
beers
notes
from
my
honeymoon
at
disney
world
the
beer
had
a
hazy
orange
color
decent
lacing
on
the
sides
pretty
fruity
aroma
dense
florals
and
really
ripe
oranges
are
dominant
average
balance
of
sweetsour
with
the
flavoring
nothing
too
spectacular
wish
it
had
some
of
the
aroma
hints
mirrored
in
the
tastes
however
the
carbonation
was
quite
good
and
led
the
beer
to
be
quite
refreshing
overall
pretty
good
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
in
general
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
not
really
into
a
very
fruity
wheat
style
beer
to
me
its
just
not
a
beer
this
would
have
to
be
a
desert
beer
that
you
could
really
only
have
one
of
its
got
a
nice
flavor
just
not
something
i
could
visit
to
often
md
lightbodied
but
that
being
said
but
rarely
am
i
able
to
drink
fruity
beers
for
a
session
and
this
one
is
no
different
d
eh
not
really
one
that
i
enjoyed
but
i
manned
up
and
finished
off
the
mug
good
thing
it
was
a
draft
special
and
it
was
cheap
the
fruit
presence
in
this
beer
was
too
fakeartificial
tasting
and
the
base
wheat
beer
itself
wasnt
anything
to
call
home
about
cant
say
ill
approach
this
one
again
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
size
head
the
raspberry
smell
was
quickly
noticed
very
overwhelming
at
first
the
smell
went
away
and
so
did
the
head
i
took
the
initial
taste
expecting
it
to
taste
like
medicine
but
i
was
wrong
the
raspberry
taste
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
expected
as
well
as
the
tart
taste
ive
read
about
the
mouthfull
was
very
watery
and
left
a
very
watery
finish
just
about
no
taste
after
it
hits
your
palate
the
taste
gets
worse
as
you
keep
drinking
i
only
had
3
and
the
last
one
was
like
drinking
water
id
only
buy
this
if
i
were
gonna
chill
with
females
who
want
to
try
something
different
drinkability
i
mean
its
got
very
little
alcohol
so
thats
a
plus
i
guess
if
youre
putting
them
back
but
i
know
bigger
beers
that
drink
easier
than
this
all
in
all
id
say
its
an
avoid
beer
and
i
was
hot
and
thirsty
when
i
drank
it
if
i
wasnt
probably
wouldnt
have
finished
it
d
avoid
d
light
bodied
and
a
little
watery
expected
a
little
more
but
still
good
what
was
i
thinking
drain
pour
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
can
only
drink
one
before
it
started
to
upset
my
stomach
this
is
not
my
favorite
abita
by
any
means
and
their
strawberry
harvest
is
one
hell
of
a
fruit
beer
i
remember
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
that
i
drank
back
in
the
day
i
liked
it
well
enough
at
the
time
and
i
suppose
it
is
still
ok
id
never
order
this
again
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
rather
hazy
peach
with
a
massive
head
that
dissolved
into
just
a
thin
line
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
i
was
rather
surprised
with
how
quickly
the
head
disappeared
also
a
crisp
carbonation
continually
sticks
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muddled
sweet
raspberries
up
front
but
help
snuff
out
the
aroma
of
a
very
weak
wheat
that
must
be
the
base
beer
other
then
that
not
very
much
the
wheat
malt
adds
this
odd
underlying
tartness
to
the
aroma
not
a
good
aroma
because
it
doesnt
accent
the
raspberries
very
well
i
wish
the
tart
raspberries
would
have
been
more
prevalent
would
have
worked
better
with
the
tartness
from
the
wheat
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
just
flat
average
smuckers
sweet
raspberry
jam
mixed
with
a
very
ho
hum
wheat
the
berry
sweetness
really
comes
through
on
the
tail
of
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
crisp
carbonation
with
a
slight
dryness
this
beer
is
ok
i
think
it
might
be
a
decent
gateway
beer
for
people
i
was
actually
hoping
for
more
raspberries
aroma
and
flavor
which
i
didnt
get
d
very
easy
going
delicious
summer
beer
or
lawnmower
fruit
beer
with
out
the
syrupy
sugaryness
to
it
overall
i
was
hoping
for
more
pronounced
raspberry
here
sure
its
noticeable
but
its
kind
of
fake
and
doesnt
comprise
much
of
this
ones
flavor
profile
drinkable
but
hardly
amazing
tastes
more
like
an
american
wheat
beer
with
a
moderate
raspberry
infusion
fruitiness
is
in
no
way
overpowering
and
is
not
really
sweet
at
all
a
good
example
of
having
fruit
in
your
brew
while
still
maintaining
a
beer
flavor
profile
a
refreshing
summertime
drinker
i
like
it
and
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
more
popular
abita
offerings
d
decent
it
tastes
so
much
like
water
but
i
dont
wanna
drink
water
i
want
beer
so
decent
turns
to
average
d
very
drinkable
i
finished
mine
in
about
10
minutes
light
alcohol
which
is
always
a
plus
purple
haze
has
a
good
taste
but
is
nowhere
near
the
top
of
what
fruit
beers
can
offer
i
would
tire
of
this
quickly
great
to
bring
to
a
party
though
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summery
lawnmower
beer
but
nothing
thats
really
going
to
impress
final
thoughts
as
a
beer
with
raspberries
as
the
main
selling
point
this
is
nothing
short
of
disappointing
final
thoughts
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
nothing
spectacular
but
better
than
some
i
might
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
otherwise
i
would
think
twice
about
getting
it
drinkability
easy
to
throw
many
of
these
back
but
the
metallic
taste
is
frustrating
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
raspberry
wheat
beer
i
would
call
it
a
malt
beverage
with
raspberry
flavor
added
it
just
seems
too
artificial
a
melding
there
you
go
very
drinkable
good
complex
flavors
without
too
much
sticking
to
the
palate
for
a
long
time
easy
to
make
a
night
of
drinking
this
stuff
not
the
greatest
but
pretty
interesting
and
a
good
brew
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fell
quickly
lacing
is
light
aroma
is
pretty
wheaty
without
much
raspberry
to
speak
of
nothing
really
good
going
for
it
on
that
front
flavor
is
light
with
a
bit
of
artificial
raspberry
extract
almost
candylike
with
a
bit
of
flinstones
vitamins
thrown
in
i
dont
think
its
horrible
tasting
but
its
not
very
good
like
liquid
kids
cereal
crunchberry
anyone
light
bodied
crisp
carbonation
second
beer
of
the
night
that
i
will
not
be
seaking
out
again
not
as
over
the
top
with
the
raspberries
as
some
but
a
very
nice
summer
brew
this
beer
would
have
earned
more
points
if
the
raspberries
were
not
so
hidden
by
the
wheat
as
it
is
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
would
be
rather
refreshing
after
a
warm
day
outdoors
however
its
definitely
not
something
i
would
want
to
session
with
because
its
kind
of
lacking
in
tastesmell
d
i
think
i
could
do
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
would
tire
of
the
fruit
pretty
quickly
when
i
want
beer
but
could
be
a
good
hot
summer
day
beer

a

a

with
a
nice
crisp
active
carbonation
a
little
sticky
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
nice
simple
and
refreshing
fruit
beer
and
quite
sessionable
as
its
not
too
sweet
nice
doughy
white
two
finger
head
after
the
pour
this
recedes
to
a

and
eventually
to
nothing
hazey
tawny
with
lots
of
yeasty
suspension
tart
fruits
and
faint
fresh
rasberries
stick
out
in
the
nose
the
most
crushed
aspirin
mixed
with
some
light
rasberries
and
some
blackberries
too
very
yeasty
beer
accentuates
the
dry
fruity
malts

summer
beer
with
its
fruity
flavortalcy
dryness
and
somewhat
watery
finish
drinkabilitymaybe
this
is
just
the
wrong
time
of
night
for
such
a
light
beer
maybe
ill
try
again
on
an
upcoming
hot
florida
summer
day
12oz
screwtop
bottle
from
the
liquor
shop
in
tyngsboro
mass
pours
a
hazy
amber
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissipating
thin
offwhite
head
smells
grainy
with
touches
of
caramel
and
biscuit
with
a
fair
bit
of
raspberry
grainy
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
citrus
obviously
a
strong
undertone
of
sweettart
raspberry
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
fairly
quaffable
american
wheat
and
fruit
beer
are
not
my
favorite
styles
for
sure
but
this
is
a
reasonably
solid
example
of
both
worth
a
try
d
moderate
drinkability
very
light
abv
combined
with
a
fairly
easy
drinking
flavor
profile
are
pluses
on
the
negative
side
i
find
the
carbonation
getting
a
bit
old
taste
is
very
refreshing
yet
quite
malty
with
a
good
but
not
overpowering
amount
of
flavor
from
the
raspberry
i
enjoy
the
wheat
character
a
lot
sometimes
these
kinds
of
beers
come
out
so
thin
and
watery
that
its
barely
a
beer
but
this
has
the
light
crispness
of
wheat
but
with
a
solid
flavor
as
well
raspberry
compliments
the
malt
character
nicely
adding
a
little
sweetness
to
the
light
malt
and
peppery
carbonation
light
body
extreme
drinkability
this
is
what
should
be
on
those
big
budweiser
signs
i
could
see
myself
having
about
10
of
these
on
a
nice
spring
day
unfortunately
its
1
degree
fahrenheit
here
right
now
so
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
pretend
cloudy
orange
2
finger
head
smells
like
malt
liquor
like
a
40
oz
taste
the
same
except
with
raspberry
syrup
added
has
an
unpleasant
twang
i
believe
i
will
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
i
dont
believe
i
would
even
take
one
for
free
well
not
if
there
was
any
other
option
available
that
is
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
this
could
be
a
very
decent
session
brew
especially
at
4
2
abv
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
something
about
this
beer
just
doesnt
work
the
flavors
seem
somewhat
unbalanced
and
everything
is
just
sort
of
outofwhack
somewhat
refreshing
but
not
as
much
so
as
one
would
think
perhaps
the
raspberries
just
arent
one
of
those
fruits
that
make
a
good
fruit
beer
d
4
0
more
body
than
i
remembered
but
still
a
bit
thin
nice
for
a
mellow
raz
wheat
good
balance
for
a
fruit
beer
not
to
overwhelming
on
the
raz
notes
i
have
good
memories
with
abita
ph
so
i
am
always
willing
to
drink
one
of
these
d
superior
drinkability
as
in
i
polished
it
off
in
about
15
minutes
in
between
cutting
and
cooking
my
dinner
theres
not
a
lot
happening
here
in
terms
of
taste
but
id
probably
have
another
especially
on
a
hot
day
or
with
pizza
abita
purple
haze
is
a
cloudy
golden
ale
with
particles
the
elastic
white
head
has
good
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
raspberry
aroma
with
notes
of
lemony
wheat
and
dough
it
is
light
bodied
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
the
flavor
isnt
dominated
by
raspberry
like
the
aroma
is
there
isnt
really
any
bitterness
to
speak
of
there
are
notes
of
lemon
and
dough
to
reflect
the
aroma
theres
is
an
appropriate
amount
of
raspberry
but
it
seems
a
bit
artificial
drink
this
when
its
hot
and
humid
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
at
4
2
can
be
sessioned
blech
poured
a
foggy
light
orangeyellow
not
alot
of
head
faint
and
sweet
smalls
of
raspberry
slight
rapberry
biterness
sweet
tones
also
yeast
not
over
falovored
with
raspberry
still
tastes
like
a
beer
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
tasty
would
make
a
great
summertime
beer
bc
its
light
and
goes
down
very
smooth
def
good
nice
and
cold
fun
bottle
and
i
would
def
recommend
this
if
it
was
on
a
beer
list
at
a
pub
it
offers
something
a
little
different
i
like
it
mouthfeel
was
adequately
zesty
and
finishes
slicksmooth
a
little
thin
in
the
body
pretty
refreshing
d
being
brought
up
on
fake
fruity
drinks
like
kool
aid
im
not
too
averse
to
fruity
beer
but
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
like
a
tropical
feel
if
im
in
that
kind
of
mood
it
really
hits
the
spot
and
becomes
quite
drinkable
solid
atmosphere
an
okay
flavor
and
feel
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
decent
quaff
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
drinkability
if
this
was
a
wheat
wheat
i
may
give
it
higher
marks
but
the
raspberry
is
very
faint
there
are
way
better
fruit
beers
this
was
really
disappointing
i
really
do
not
like
the
finish
and
will
be
passing
on
this
one
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
an
overall
enjoyable
experience
for
a
fruit
beer
my
sister
who
basically
hates
all
beer
will
at
least
finish
one
of
these
and
mostly
enjoy
it
another
example
of
an
abita
beer
seemingly
geared
towards
drinkers
new
to
the
craft
scene
and
therefore
a
potential
turnoff
to
veteran
craft
drinkers
still
on
a
warm
day
probably
not
a
bad
beer
to
session
this
is
really
the
only
abita
flagship
i
would
want
to
buy
a
sixer
of
during
the
summer
besides
jockamo
pours
a
hazy
who
wouldve
guessed
light
amber
with
a
slightly
pinkish
hue
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
in
a
properly
cleaned
glass
aromas
of
standard
wheat
malt
but
with
a
slightlytoopronounced
tart
raspberry
presence
tastes
like
weak
weizen
with
light
sweet
and
sour
fruity
overtones
strange
almost
skunky
character
at
the
end
though
its
not
very
offensive
in
the
end
purple
haze
just
seems
fake
to
me
in
its
sweetness
and
fruit
character
a
very
tasty
spring
water
brew
if
im
ever
in
louisiana
id
like
to
visit
abita
springs
to
see
the
brewery
pretty
typical
wheat
with
some
fruit
fruit
taste
isnt
overly
apparent
but
adds
a
little
to
the
beer
nicely
carbonated
and
light
bodied
very
refreshing
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
wheat
if
you
want
a
wheat
with
a
little
fruit
taste
this
is
pretty
good
for
a
low
price
d
good
drinkable
brew
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
without
being
too
much
if
a
fruit
beer
notes
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
like
wheat
beers
and
raspberry
you
should
like
this
the
raspberry
is
present
enough
to
offer
balance
and
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
a
head
that
goes
to
about
one
half
incharoma
is
a
very
very
faint
raspberry
taste
is
raspberry
and
wheat
not
a
particularly
great
beer
although
not
awful
either
probably
worth
one
tryalthough
i
doubt
many
would
come
back
for
seconds
got
this
beer
on
tap
at
times
bar
grill
ive
also
had
it
numerous
times
in
the
bottle
before
as
well
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
slight
maroon
hue
small
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
raspberries
dominate
the
smell
with
a
slight
smell
of
malts
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
except
it
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
the
smell
definitely
a
wheat
beer
by
the
taste
the
beer
is
a
bit
watery
but
this
is
the
case
with
many
abita
brews
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
as
well
it
is
much
easier
to
have
a
few
of
these
at
the
bar
than
other
beers
you
may
see
on
tap
drinkability
very
very
easy
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
was
very
suprised
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
and
proably
my
favoite
fruit
beers
just
not
good
really
watery
tasting
needs
some
complexity
and
something
else
maybe
beer
appearance
is
by
far
the
best
part
of
this
beer
the
idea
of
a
raspberry
witbier
isnt
bad
but
needs
more
beer
qualities
if
you
really
must
have
a
raspberry
brew
try
celis
raspberry
or
a
raspberry
lambic
the
smell
was
a
great
preview
for
this
brew
quite
tart
anyone
find
this
on
tap
drinkability
is
good
if
your
tastes
run
to
fruit
beers
abv
must
be
about
5
would
be
my
guess
was
definately
a
little
light
on
the
body
carbonation
was
good
from
a
drinkibg
standpoint
the
low
quality
lowered
the
score
although
it
was
drinkable
i
could
imagine
this
to
be
a
girly
training
beer
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
wheat
ale
with
little
infusion
with
raspberry
i
thought
the
fruit
flavor
would
be
more
pronounced
honestly
it
left
me
a
bit
disapointed
i
could
probably
drink
a
ton
of
these
if
i
were
sitting
poolside
in
the
summer
maybe
i
should
have
had
it
in
the
summer
instead
of
in
autumn
it
is
a
nice
yet
unremarkable
drinkable
beer
i
would
certainly
prefer
a
hoegarden
or
alagash
if
i
wanted
a
wheat
ale
additionally
a
wheat
ale
with
fruit
influence
try
the
3f
gumballhead
d
definitely
something
to
throw
a
girl
at
a
party
if
she
doesnt
like
the
taste
of
beer
as
my
roommate
put
it
i
concur
a
light
beer
with
a
mild
fruity
taste
above
average
mf
d
light
and
fizzy
with
above
medium
carbonation
leaves
an
off
flavor
on
the
palate
with
the
feeling
of
artificial
sweetener
or
diet
soda
however
the
overall
lightness
and
mild
emptied
this
glass
in
no
time
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
there
is
lots
of
white
head
and
tight
lace
it
has
a
golden
body
with
a
good
amount
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
and
if
you
look
close
you
will
see
some
small
sediment
it
is
hazy
but
not
purple
the
smell
is
wheat
like
and
grass
maybe
a
little
bit
sweet
it
has
a
spicy
mass
produced
lager
taste
at
first
i
know
it
is
ale
but
that
is
just
how
it
tasted
to
me
this
beer
is
crisp
and
only
has
little
raspberry
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
refreshing
and
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
average
fruit
beer
notes
from
91904
the
drinkablility
of
this
beer
would
have
been
much
higher
if
not
for
the
fake
purple
taste
i
probably
wont
return
to
this
one
any
time
soon
aroma
is
sour
with
a
slightly
fruity
smell
appearance
is
similar
to
a
cloudy
pink
wine
cooler
the
taste
is
bitter
and
has
quite
a
lot
of
malt
but
very
little
raspberry
somewhat
dry
finish
with
some
wheat
flavor
overall
it
was
a
letdown
maybe
more
fruit
flavor
would
help
d
this
beer
would
have
been
a
perfect
summer
beer
but
the
amount
of
carbonation
packed
into
this
beer
did
not
make
it
very
drinkable
to
me
and
the
raspberry
taste
was
more
artificial
to
me
than
natural
it
wasnt
as
sharp
with
carbonation
as
im
used
to
especially
with
wheat
beers
but
it
was
decent
and
i
drank
through
it
pretty
quickly
this
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappears
smell
is
citrusy
with
faint
raspberries
tastes
of
tart
rasberries
with
a
dry
dry
taste
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
fruit
beers
are
not
my
favorite
this
one
is
okay
for
the
style
id
enjoy
another
d
this
is
the
perfect
summer
craft
brew
even
your
gf
will
enjoy
this
tasty
drink
above
all
its
drinkable
and
in
the
end
i
would
do
a
sixer
any
given
night
combined
with
some
burning
trees
did
i
mention
that
i
love
raspberries
if
the
beer
refused
to
pour
i
dont
mind
this
beer
isnt
a
6
or
a
9
poured
from
stubby
brown
12
oz
bottle
to
a
weizen
glass
a
hazy
golden
amber
no
purple
at
all
with
a
half
inch
of
white
foam
head
with
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
berries
and
wheat
has
a
mild
sweet
rasberry
and
wheat
flavor
somewhat
watery
it
is
a
light
and
very
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
this
many
times
before
and
will
continue
to
it
may
not
be
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
if
you
are
having
a
session
appearance
is
average
with
a
straw
yellow
color
a
bit
of
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
decent
with
some
nice
raspberry
notes
and
decent
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
almost
all
raspberry
didnt
taste
like
it
was
meshed
really
well
the
brewer
said
this
could
be
due
to
the
fact
that
its
mixed
in
after
fermentation
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
in
body
drinkability
is
very
good
d
abita
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
this
review
is
not
free
from
bias
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
always
love
to
have
some
on
hand
in
the
fridge
as
a
former
fan
of
other
adulterants
how
could
i
not
give
this
one
a
whirl
out
of
the
bottle
in
flagstaff
az
of
all
places
this
was
light
amber
with
a
faded
plumpink
hue
visible
in
good
light
the
nose
was
tart
raspberry
and
some
light
malt
the
flavors
were
fruity
and
sweet
but
the
raspberry
lacked
definition
it
was
more
general
fruit
sweetness
with
wheat
beneath
that
not
much
else
though
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
a
little
overcarbonated
i
felt
like
this
was
a
good
theory
that
was
poorly
executed
similar
to
long
trails
blackbeary
wheat
overallagain
a
decent
fruit
beer
somewhat
subdued
but
refreshing
it
was
very
light
and
refreshing
i
would
definately
buy
the
occasional
sixer
of
this
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
even
among
beers
of
its
kind
i
wouldnt
select
this
one
over
most
others
the
name
and
bottle
promises
much
poured
out
a
muted
murky
yellow
gold
color
medium
head
smelled
of
sweet
raspberry
tastes
of
a
tangy
malt
background
with
a
slight
hop
finish
the
most
noticeable
attribute
of
course
is
the
sweet
raspberry
its
not
often
that
you
hear
a
beer
bottle
advertise
a
certain
flavor
and
then
have
that
flavor
so
present
that
it
makes
you
forget
its
beer
in
my
opinion
raspberry
flavoring
is
one
thing
but
the
raspberry
was
a
bit
too
much
in
this
one
it
tasted
like
i
had
accidentally
poured
beer
in
a
welchs
or
something
overall
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
i
would
probably
turn
one
down
if
offered
but
thats
just
me
it
is
what
it
is
expect
lots
of
fruit
poured
a
golden
body
with
some
purplish
tints
hence
the
name
not
very
impressive
miniscule
head
that
died
quickly
but
left
lace
patches
a
quasisweet
im
assuming
from
wheat
twang
smell
mixed
in
with
a
very
fruity
smell
more
like
tropical
fruits
than
citric
ones
youd
find
in
a
hefe
light
bodied
to
me
it
is
a
tad
watery
and
slick
but
does
pack
a
fruit
punch
power
unfortunately
it
felt
like
i
was
drinking
punch
and
i
couldnt
really
taste
any
hops
or
malt
and
it
didnt
feel
like
a
beer
i
prefer
my
fruit
beers
be
beery
my
nonbeer
drinking
wife
liked
it
so
i
guess
thats
there
demographic
non
beer
drinkers
not
just
my
wife
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
bet
for
somebody
who
doesnt
particularly
care
for
beer
flavor
but
doesnt
mind
fruit
however
i
have
had
far
superior
fruit
beers
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
goldenorange
with
very
little
head
smell
is
nice
citrusberriesgrain
and
more
berries
tastes
basically
like
a
wheat
beer
with
artificial
berry
flavoring
added
just
too
much
flavoring
better
on
tap
when
i
had
it
before
still
not
even
close
to
my
top
d
i
have
no
idea
why
i
revisited
this
one
ill
pass
on
this
one
seems
like
more
of
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
hmm
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
one
of
the
most
expensive
sixers
on
the
block
the
purple
hue
was
pretty
cool
not
much
else
tasted
like
a
typical
wheat
with
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
raspberry
flavor
nice
and
drinkable
but
not
quite
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
a
little
too
watered
down
and
unassertive
to
me
could
drink
this
no
problem
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
da
light
and
refreshing
brew
that
is
not
going
to
catch
your
attention
to
much
a
good
way
to
introduce
women
to
beer
or
sweet
tooths
in
general
nothing
special
but
glad
i
took
a
revist
to
one
of
the
beers
i
drank
during
my
beast
days
d
it
goes
down
easy
but
has
some
issues
with
the
flavor
profile
d
im
conflicted
about
this
one
on
one
hand
the
fruit
flavors
were
not
overdone
or
cloyingly
sweet
as
in
some
other
beers
which
was
definitely
refreshing
still
there
wasnt
much
about
purple
haze
that
screamed
drink
me
it
was
a
nice
flavor
and
a
good
change
of
pace
beer
but
not
something
id
really
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
if
there
were
other
choices
available
serving
bottle
to
glass
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
medium
foamy
head
on
a
cloudy
clumpy
golden
body
i
was
a
bit
amazed
at
how
thick
it
appeared
with
the
bottom
of
bottle
sediment
yeast
literally
suspended
in
the
brew
the
raspberry
smell
was
obvious
but
not
overpowering
a
hint
of
staleness
and
hop
bitterness
in
there
as
well
taste
starts
out
raspberry
shifts
to
wheatiness
then
back
to
raspberry
to
finish
again
raspberry
not
overpowering
but
in
fact
a
bit
watered
down
didnt
feel
nearly
as
thick
as
it
looked
im
going
to
have
to
give
this
another
go
just
to
see
if
that
thickness
is
consistent
drinkability
fine
enough
for
a
fruity
flavored
beer
if
thats
your
thing
overall
a
smooth
beer
but
the
combination
of
raspberry
and
orange
was
not
quite
a
combination
i
really
enjoyed
drinkability
im
surprised
at
such
a
low
rating
for
this
beer
they
say
at
least
that
real
raspberries
are
used
and
though
its
not
drippingly
fresh
or
anything
the
raspberry
adds
a
nice
balanced
flavor
with
the
wheat
without
being
too
sweet
its
not
my
new
favorite
beer
or
anything
but
i
found
it
pretty
nice
for
the
summer
and
enjoyed
a
few
of
them
quite
easily
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
on
tap
and
many
times
from
bottle
the
raspberry
flavor
is
mild
but
gives
the
beer
a
nice
slight
hint
of
fruitiness
the
wheat
aspect
seems
much
more
apparent
in
the
flavorand
aroma
mouthfeel
is
light
and
increases
its
overall
drinkability
its
also
nice
to
drink
beer
made
from
the
natural
abita
springs
in
louisiana
aside
from
these
qualities
few
things
stand
out
about
the
drink
its
not
bad
but
nothing
too
impressive
either
d
ok
for
a
lawnmower
ale
but
not
a
wealth
of
flavor
here
and
modest
raspberry
stays
out
of
the
spotlight
which
seems
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
a
beer
called
purple
haze
i
might
try
this
on
draft
but
this
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
any
time
soon
was
suprised
by
this
beer
or
should
i
say
lack
of
this
beer
took
a
whiff
after
i
opened
the
bottle
was
expecting
to
smell
something
of
raspberries
but
all
i
could
smell
was
straw
the
taste
was
bland
and
the
carbonation
minimal
not
a
very
good
wheat
brew
much
less
a
wheat
brew
with
fruit
flavor
not
worth
having
again
d
good
drinkability
the
sweetness
does
get
a
little
old
after
a
while
but
would
be
a
nice
beer
in
warm
conditions
this
beer
was
not
my
favorite
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
brownorange
with
an
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
aroma
is
obviously
raspberryish
with
some
wheaty
esters
flavor
combines
the
insipidness
of
banana
pith
with
the
saccharinity
of
raspberry
syrup
those
two
aspects
even
out
into
mediocrity
really
light
and
drinkable
just
not
interesting
suffice
to
say
i
didnt
like
it
i
didnt
even
finish
it
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
i
dont
know
but
i
expected
much
more
out
of
it
taste
is
almost
like
stone
ground
corn
meal
with
some
grain
as
well
raspberry
flavors
in
this
one
are
nearly
nonexistent
and
very
faint
with
some
slight
tartness
on
the
finish
it
might
be
a
freshness
issue
the
freshness
date
on
this
one
is
of
the
notched
kind
on
the
label
but
none
of
the
numbers
are
notched
on
it
but
still
tastes
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
with
a
visible
freshness
date
to
see
if
it
is
any
different
overall
not
a
a
brew
but
not
deserving
of
a
c
either
its
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
d
an
ok
fruitwheat
could
go
either
way
on
the
raspberries
i
like
my
fruit
a
bit
stronger
but
i
can
see
how
some
people
would
prefer
this
subtler
touch
good
refreshing
summer
beer
md
mouthfeel
is
light
with
great
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
being
light
could
have
6
or
so
mouthfeel
is
ok
for
a
wheat
beer
not
too
watery
but
not
the
smooth
crispness
i
want
in
a
summer
beer
drinkability
is
ok
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
d
well
it
goes
down
so
damn
easy
that
it
has
to
be
at
least
a
4
there
just
isnt
a
ton
of
flavor
here
however
its
smooth
but
only
because
there
isnt
anything
that
can
be
offputting
about
it

all
in
all
not
a
real
drinkable
brew
in
my
book
more
a
curiosity
than
anything
if
you
like
this
style
beer
its
probably
worth
a
try
but
nothing
ill
be
buying
again
the
body
is
closer
to
moderate
than
light
a
bit
high
on
carbonation
in
feel
as
there
was
a
light
carbonic
bite
overall
a
little
to
fake
for
me
but
very
easy
drinking
come
on
its
a
fruit
beer
what
can
you
say
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
this
would
be
a
good
hot
summer
day
beer
easily
sessionable
and
not
so
fruity
as
to
drive
you
away
from
it
maybe
not
a
bad
jump
for
someone
who
is
considering
venturing
out
d
i
am
not
a
fan
so
i
cant
drink
it
one
of
my
buddies
swears
by
this
beer
but
this
one
is
not
for
me
served
to
me
cloudy
and
well
hazy
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
1finger
head
that
quickly
fizzles
away
the
smell
a
bit
too
strong
and
syrupy
for
my
taste
plenty
of
raspberry
but
more
like
the
manufactured
processed
raspberries
i
found
some
grassy
pale
malts
hidden
in
there
too
the
taste
however
it
much
better
with
more
muted
flavor
than
the
smell
the
taste
is
still
dominated
by
raspberries
but
its
more
balanced
between
tastes
fruit
pale
malts
wheat
its
got
a
crisp
little
bite
to
it
but
its
certainly
not
from
any
hop
presence
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
is
quite
refreshing
with
a
long
sweet
lingering
flavor
i
first
had
this
beer
when
living
in
mississippi
and
after
moving
to
new
york
i
was
thrilled
to
learn
that
a
bar
near
times
square
called
bourbon
street
had
it
on
tap
i
can
assure
you
on
a
hot
summers
day
in
the
south
this
beer
is
a
perfect
thirstquencher
but
on
a
warm
day
in
the
northeast
its
pretty
tasty
too
poured
small
out
the
bottle
with
a
one
finger
head
smelled
like
a
fusion
of
grape
and
a
good
hefeweizen
the
grape
was
somewhat
dominant
in
the
taste
but
not
in
an
overbearing
way
and
i
thought
it
was
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
weak
and
it
went
down
rather
smooth
but
still
enjoyable
overall
all
a
tasty
brew
nothing
to
knock
other
people
over
to
get
at
it
if
they
are
in
your
way
but
quite
good
none
the
less
raspberries
and
grapes
in
the
flavor
a
little
bit
of
hops
come
through
in
the
end
with
a
little
bit
of
added
spice
as
well
this
beer
is
tangy
medium
bodied
and
noticeably
carbonated
the
taste
is
good
but
its
a
little
watery
overall
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
is
smooth
and
quenching
i
was
worried
the
berry
quality
would
make
it
a
sweet
and
overpowering
experience
but
instead
they
were
subtle
and
complemented
what
would
make
a
very
nice
sessionbeer
in
warmer
weather
i
started
out
giving
the
drinkability
a
4
0
but
in
the
span
of
half
a
beer
its
gone
down
by
half
a
point
the
fruitiness
gets
to
be
too
much
after
one
ill
stick
with
a
good
hefe
no
after
taste
not
a
beer
i
really
enjoyed
grapefruitcolored
pour
into
a
pint
glass
translucent
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
to
meet
a
thick
layer
of
white
head
aroma
is
half
raspberry
half
metallic
almost
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
tart
taste
is
small
on
the
raspberryfruity
notes
its
wheaty
and
a
bit
watereddown
feels
light
and
not
as
bubbly
as
the
appearance
lets
on
no
aftertaste
yet
very
refreshing
as
for
the
drinkability
it
has
little
to
no
complexity
but
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
raspberry
wheat
brew
it
was
unfiltered
like
all
wheat
beers
so
it
had
that
kind
of
clouded
texture
but
it
had
a
very
strong
and
distinct
fresh
raspberry
flavor
with
very
little
bitterness
not
bad
for
a
specialty
beer
but
it
was
definitely
girly
pours
a
hazy
orange
peachy
color
no
head
no
lace
well
carbonated
bubbles
rising
throughout
the
life
of
the
beer
slightly
tart
aroma
in
the
nose
crisp
tart
rasberry
taste
upfront
not
overly
sweet
or
strong
fruit
in
flavor
bready
flavor
as
it
finishes
highly
drinkable
seems
like
it
would
quite
refreshing
in
the
summer
d
i
couldnt
imagine
wanting
to
have
another
one
of
these
d
its
an
alright
beer
and
quite
easy
to
put
down
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
with
and
consume
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
though
no
surprises
here
this
is
exactly
what
i
expected
its
not
bad
but
you
find
me
drinking
another
d
light
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
afternoon
i
would
have
again
if
i
ever
want
a
light
beer
i
would
grab
this
one
good
night
now
but
since
i
have
had
one
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
try
it
again
not
bad
though
d
too
fruity
and
sweet
for
my
taste
has
a
best
before
labeling
system
but
is
not
utilized
on
the
bottle
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
very
slightly
cloudy
straw
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
small
amounts
of
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
underwhelming
slightly
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
raspberries
taste
is
only
slightly
better
skunky
lager
mixed
with
fruity
raspberries
finishes
grainy
decently
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
stagnant
carbonation
overall
drinkability
is
low
because
i
didnt
like
the
beer
really
at
all
making
it
difficult
to
drink
disappointing
with
such
a
cool
name
appears
a
clouded
grapefruit
like
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
forms
thick
even
streaks
of
lace
this
is
an
old
favorite
from
my
early
days
of
beerdom
aroma
contains
tart
raspberry
with
acidic
sharp
wheat
and
mild
yogurt
tanginess
not
overly
sweet
like
most
fruit
infused
wheat
beers
these
days
just
natural
tart
raspberry
puree
flavor
has
creamy
but
tart
raspberry
sweetness
with
lingering
citrus
frit
and
sharp
wheat
notes
sticking
around
on
the
palate
it
never
gets
too
cloying
with
the
sweetness
a
nice
mix
of
tart
and
mild
creamy
raspberry
infused
yogurt
with
that
classic
lactic
character
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
even
carbonation
slightly
sticky
with
a
small
amount
of
residual
sugars
clinging
to
the
palate
body
overall
is
medium
to
light
textured
drinkability
a
solid
refreshing
fruit
beer
that
i
could
dig
in
moderation
in
the
summer
time
heat
i
will
always
hold
a
special
spot
for
this
one
since
i
discovered
it
while
living
in
socal
after
my
freshman
year
of
college
o
refreshing
and
gentle
two
good
things
that
all
fruit
beers
should
try
to
emulate
otherwise
pretty
boring
came
to
the
table
with
a
decent
golden
coloring
no
purple
coloring
at
all
but
little
head
and
no
lacing
it
has
a
crisp
slightly
fruity
scent
the
same
for
the
taste
but
it
was
hard
to
detect
what
kind
of
fruit
was
in
there
it
also
had
characteristics
more
like
a
lager
than
a
wheat
beer
it
went
down
smooth
although
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
wheat
beer
i
would
never
turn
one
of
these
down
but
i
wont
buy
any
more
for
myself
either
d
i
choose
bush
d
not
a
good
drinkable
amber
drank
like
overcarbonated
grape
juice
ugghhh
i
could
see
this
drink
being
good
for
a
real
hot
day
light
and
tasty
or
maybe
as
an
after
dinner
beer
very
cloudy
yellow
in
the
glass
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
light
fruit
i
guess
raspberry
but
it
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
also
a
bit
of
light
grain
in
the
smell
as
well
taste
is
fairly
sharp
it
starts
like
an
average
american
wheat
beer
but
then
comes
the
fake
fruit
which
stays
pretty
one
dimensional
and
average
at
best
mouthfeel
is
decent
light
and
effervesent
but
the
fruit
flavoring
leaves
a
slick
sweetness
that
is
a
bit
unpleasant
decently
drinkable
not
very
challenging
and
not
too
sweet
that
it
is
cloying
but
it
is
tough
to
drink
when
you
have
better
options
d
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
and
up
there
with
my
wheats
i
believe
the
closer
you
get
to
louisianna
and
the
brewery
the
better
the
beer
gets
do
a
six
pack
its
a
great
beer
id
pass
on
this
one
there
are
much
better
fruit
wheat
beers
out
there
believe
me
d
one
of
the
better
wheatfruit
beers
out
there
not
a
taste
sensation
but
it
would
make
a
excellent
summer
beer
on
a
90
degree
day
cloudy
pinkish
pink
lemonade
like
pour
with
a
bright
bleached
white
head
that
doesnt
last
smell
is
a
bit
wheaty
and
mostly
raspberry
as
expected
with
a
touch
of
a
metallic
smell
that
lasted
after
the
head
faded
taste
is
mostly
raspberry
and
a
bit
of
wheat
in
the
finish
but
its
slight
i
didnt
like
this
as
much
as
i
remember
liking
it
when
all
i
drank
was
bud
light
and
hard
ciders
its
an
ok
beginner
beer
id
say
as
my
girlfriend
liked
it
and
so
did
i
when
i
hadnt
tried
or
gotten
used
to
many
of
the
different
styles
or
bolder
flavors
that
i
really
enjoy
now
fresh
i
wouldnt
classify
this
beer
as
a
session
brew
or
a
one
and
done
i
dont
think
its
a
dessert
beer
or
a
breakfast
beer
either
if
youre
going
to
have
one
have
one
around
lunchtime
just
like
i
did
i
dont
see
anymore
purple
haze
in
my
future
unless
its
rolled
up
in
paper
drinkability
is
nice
i
was
impressed
by
the
taste
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
or
two
in
an
evening
as
it
is
pretty
fruity
the
taste
on
this
beer
is
extremely
lacking
and
its
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
i
normally
enjoy
fruit
beers
and
understand
their
role
in
the
beer
world
but
this
beer
doesnt
even
live
up
to
those
standards
its
extremely
watery
with
zero
body
and
the
raspberry
tastes
very
fake
im
actually
having
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
and
i
certainly
wont
be
buying
it
again
nose
is
extremely
metallic
with
a
grain
edge
to
it
flavor
is
actually
pretty
smooth
with
the
fruit
robust
wheat
body
with
a
smooth
and
seemingly
natural
berry
influence
feel
has
a
real
strong
large
bubble
hitting
the
tongue
and
a
pretty
standard
liquid
feel
overall
pretty
drinkable
i
will
say
that
it
is
oddly
earthy
and
robust
and
delivers
a
not
so
foofooey
fruit
beer
experience
may
not
be
the
most
beautiful
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
surely
interesting
poured
nice
from
the
bottle
with
good
color
to
it
the
aroma
of
raspberries
wasnt
very
strong
in
my
opinion
but
overall
the
smell
was
good
the
body
was
in
the
light
to
medium
range
and
i
found
it
to
be
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
the
raspberry
flavor
was
present
but
not
overly
strong
which
i
liked
since
it
didnt
overpower
the
rest
of
the
tastes
in
the
overall
i
think
its
a
good
fruit
infused
wheat
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
i
only
recently
started
enjoying
fruity
beers
ufos
raspberry
hefeweizen
being
one
of
my
favorites
so
i
thought
i
would
give
purple
haze
a
shot
it
pours
nicely
but
the
head
was
quick
to
dissipate
there
is
only
a
small
hint
of
raspberry
in
the
beer
which
was
disappointing
to
me
there
also
isnt
much
body
to
the
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
but
there
are
many
others
that
i
would
choose
before
i
came
back
to
this
one
its
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
not
something
to
sit
and
drink
one
after
the
other
the
flavor
is
not
as
bad
as
i
feared
theres
no
harsh
syrup
taste
little
medicinal
flavor
and
the
wheat
flavor
gives
it
a
nice
balance
its
still
a
little
too
sodalike
for
me
and
i
have
had
better
fruit
beers
but
i
have
also
certainly
had
worse
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
as
expected
as
mr
burns
would
say
i
know
what
i
hate
and
i
dont
hate
this
on
the
contrary
it
was
actually
a
decent
surprise
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
initial
aroma
of
hoppy
wheat
and
raspberry
was
amusing
but
this
quickly
faded
to
a
taste
that
was
not
tart
but
rather
flat
wheat
taste
and
nose
tried
to
make
itself
known
but
was
masked
by
this
raspberrylike
presence
i
enjoy
some
fruit
beers
like
the
belgian
krieks
and
other
lambics
but
will
pass
on
this
american
version
in
the
future
12
oz
single
hazy
pale
golden
with
a
large
tightbubbly
white
head
good
laceing
loved
the
aroma
of
this
one
the
raspberries
are
really
well
highlighted
and
as
i
love
the
smell
of
raspberries
thats
enough
for
me
the
raspberry
isnt
quite
as
pronounced
in
the
taste
its
rather
subdued
and
in
the
background
to
the
wheatygrassy
flavours
palate
lets
this
one
down
very
watery
too
limp
overall
a
mixed
bag
but
i
suppose
ok
i
find
some
fruit
beers
too
over
the
top
and
artificial
tasting
at
times
this
feels
and
tastes
real
and
refreshing
i
could
see
this
one
being
quite
popular
in
the
heat
and
humidity
of
louisiana
pretty
nice
beer
overall
d
easy
to
down
the
first
2
but
after
that
becomes
a
little
too
fruity
if
the
girlfriend
or
wife
is
around
she
will
love
it
all
in
all
a
good
one
this
beer
didnt
offer
what
i
usually
expect
from
a
wheatfruit
beer
the
raspberry
flavor
was
no
where
to
be
found
it
did
have
a
nice
smell
but
the
taste
didnt
match
it
a
friend
recommended
it
to
me
and
needless
to
say
i
was
not
impressed
and
will
not
be
trying
it
again
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
a
pretty
light
brew
overall
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
arent
great
as
it
may
be
overcarbonated
at
times
and
really
fizzes
in
your
mouth
i
dont
like
fruit
beers
my
wife
does
were
visiting
our
daughter
in
houston
and
my
wife
made
me
buy
this
for
her
she
thought
it
was
great
it
was
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
the
label
says
the
raspberry
puree
gives
it
a
slightly
purple
tint
yeah
right
very
sweet
fruity
aroma
sweet
cloying
taste
my
wife
can
drink
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
well
this
didnt
work
out
did
it
if
it
werent
for
the
raspberry
flavor
this
would
be
a
very
boring
beer
because
of
its
boringness
with
a
hint
of
fruit
this
might
make
an
alright
introduction
beer
to
somebody
otherwise
i
would
frogleap
this
one
this
is
a
beer
that
my
wife
likes
alot
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
the
head
has
minimal
thickness
about
a
half
inch
which
diminishes
quickly
the
head
that
remains
just
barely
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
with
a
large
void
in
the
middle
there
is
very
little
lacing
and
even
that
has
a
hard
time
hanging
around
the
smell
is
good
it
resonates
a
sweet
raspberry
smell
followed
by
a
slight
hop
and
malt
presence
as
far
as
taste
goes
i
prefer
an
ale
to
a
lager
in
the
way
of
fruit
beers
however
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
tart
taste
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
followed
by
a
very
light
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
more
concentrated
on
the
sweet
raspberry
flavor
than
anything
else
leaving
a
candy
like
component
in
the
throat
this
is
a
very
effervescent
beer
with
a
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
a
domestic
light
beer
the
sweetness
leaves
the
drinkability
at
one
beer
per
session
more
than
that
and
you
would
be
likely
to
end
up
with
a
stomach
ache
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
pale
whitishorange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
raspberry
and
v8
juice
it
is
not
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
lacks
the
nasty
vegetables
of
the
aroma
but
almost
completely
lacks
the
raspberry
too
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
it
but
nothing
much
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
unnaturally
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
disappointing
brew
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
this
again
d
if
youre
a
fan
of
raspberries
i
could
see
drinking
this
frequently
personally
im
not
so
i
likely
wont
be
drinking
this
one
again
there
are
some
fruit
beers
i
like
as
a
warm
weather
beer
and
some
i
cant
stand
this
is
one
of
the
former
i
cant
see
getting
excited
by
this
at
all
but
it
would
make
a
decent
beer
on
a
hot
day
particularly
if
you
are
sharing
with
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
the
way
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
session
drinking
however
a
nice
smooth
drinking
beer
the
tartness
of
the
fruit
isnt
evident
at
first
but
toward
the
end
of
the
brew
it
kicks
in
giving
an
authentic
fruit
character
no
hops
per
style
very
clean
very
drinkable
light
crisp
feel
very
tangy
very
good
served
cold
making
it
a
good
summer
choice
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
good
for
the
ladies
just
couldnt
get
by
the
syrupy
feel
didnt
want
another
initial
head
was
crazy
huge
but
it
did
settle
down
to
just
above
a
film
color
is
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
touch
of
orange
to
it
smell
was
rich
and
bready
sweetness
undenearth
that
and
a
touch
of
sharpness
flavor
seemed
bready
and
yeasty
with
the
malt
coming
in
afterwards
the
hops
are
there
and
just
a
touch
of
berry
that
came
in
mostly
toward
the
end
and
in
the
aftertaste
berry
flavor
doesnt
come
off
as
sweet
but
more
like
what
you
get
from
those
lightly
flavored
unsweeted
waters
aftertatse
is
quite
dry
with
the
berry
flavor
there
a
bit
and
the
grains
kicking
around
mouhtfeel
was
rich
and
drying
but
not
heavy
low
carbonation
drinkability
was
soso
it
wasnt
really
my
kind
of
beer
but
it
wasnt
bad
or
offputting
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
unfiltered
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
malt
and
raspberries
the
taste
is
pretty
thin
with
some
malt
and
a
hint
of
the
raspberry
flavoring
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
an
average
fruit
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
but
i
will
most
likely
not
purchase
again
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
it
was
a
change
of
pace
kind
of
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
some
time
pours
a
hazy
orangishyellow
color
with
a
good
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
has
a
fruity
wheaty
aroma
to
it
the
raspberry
certainly
sticks
out
the
raspberry
is
the
strongest
part
of
the
taste
too
but
not
too
overpower
like
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
after
the
raspberry
taste
the
wheat
is
also
very
apparent
has
a
moderate
mouthfeel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
while
at
the
same
time
not
overpowering
worth
checking
out
poured
an
attractive
golden
color
with
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
very
smooth
and
flavorful
fruit
flavor
is
much
more
evident
than
in
other
beers
ive
had
kind
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
which
seems
to
be
a
common
characteristic
of
abita
beer
i
think
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
but
not
something
i
would
sit
down
and
drink
10
of
pours
a
dark
cloudy
gold
with
a
somewhat
dusty
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
light
somewhat
cereally
malts
with
a
dominant
red
raspberry
note
initially
sweet
on
the
palate
with
a
healthy
amount
of
wheat
and
fruitderived
acidity
the
fruitiness
is
only
forward
during
the
beginning
and
the
end
theres
a
bit
of
a
sour
tightly
bitter
finish
though
that
ruins
things
a
bit
fresh
and
lively
with
acidity
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
decent
fruitwheat
beer
with
good
fruit
flavor
and
some
crispness
uncomplex
but
refreshing
its
nothing
deep
and
doesnt
have
to
be
drinkabiltyi
enjoy
this
beer
as
fruit
beers
go
this
has
a
nice
taste
to
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
foofoo
factor
is
high
drinkability
is
ok
for
a
summer
evening
nothing
id
seek
out
again
this
is
something
that
you
have
to
consider
basic
tastes
as
wheat
beers
and
especially
fruit
flavored
ones
may
not
be
for
everyone
after
having
had
a
frambozen
recently
this
was
a
pleasant
contrast
in
being
just
a
subtle
raspberry
flavoring
perhaps
along
the
lines
of
how
the
apricot
is
to
9
this
one
had
a
solid
cloudy
look
typical
of
a
good
wheat
beer
yellow
with
a
medium
head
you
do
smell
the
rasberry
most
notably
but
the
flavor
seems
a
little
less
obvious
with
a
sour
quality
this
is
a
nice
option
for
a
wheat
beer
but
not
hugely
compelling
purple
haze
wheat
brew
has
a
fresh
raspberry
puree
that
is
added
after
filtration
i
was
served
purple
haze
in
aon
tap
and
clearly
noted
visable
bits
of
raspberry
pulp
floating
both
in
the
beer
and
lining
the
bottom
where
it
had
settled
purple
haze
is
a
light
brew
with
a
slight
purple
tint
from
the
raspberries
in
the
color
when
i
first
smelled
the
brew
i
thought
it
smelled
more
like
a
grape
drink
instead
of
raspberry
once
i
tasted
it
i
definitely
got
a
mouthful
of
sweet
raspberry
ale
best
by
921
notched
on
back
poured
into
a
glass
with
a
pinkish
tint
very
cloudy
hazy
i
suppose
but
not
due
to
any
identifiable
yeast
the
head
is
thin
with
very
mild
carbonation
smell
is
faint
fruity
obvious
raspberry
the
mouthfeel
is
horrible
very
thin
i
wanted
it
out
of
my
mouth
right
when
it
touched
my
tongue
the
taste
is
fruity
but
mostly
overpowering
malty
flavor
very
little
hops
almost
tasted
like
stale
fruity
macrobeer
didnt
like
it
no
sir
not
one
bit
really
quickly
they
should
send
out
some
cheaper
kegs
of
this
stuff
maybe
7580
a
halfbarrel
at
a
party
this
stuff
would
be
awsome
if
it
was
for
a
good
price
and
would
beat
all
other
kegs
priced
the
same
i
dont
see
too
many
sparkling
reviews
for
the
bottles
of
this
stuff
and
college
chicks
could
totally
get
into
kegs
of
this
stuff
just
a
thought
pours
a
slightly
pinkish
tinge
on
your
standard
wheat
beer
nose
is
strongly
raspberry
without
much
else
taste
is
a
better
mix
of
raspberry
and
wheat
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
alright
i
guess
i
give
it
a
slight
edge
because
it
is
uncommon
in
terms
of
its
raspberry
flavor
however
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
interesting
or
special
with
its
flavor
so
in
my
mind
its
just
average
i
guess
check
out
pynk
by
yards
if
you
want
an
interesting
take
on
the
raspberry
flavor
done
is
definitly
enough
eric
d
super
easy
to
drink
because
it
has
almost
no
taste
but
is
smooth
enough
to
keep
the
mouth
happy
tried
this
at
a
beer
tasting
it
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
pink
hue
and
a
thin
head
smelled
and
tasted
somewhat
like
bubblegum
or
berryflavored
hard
candy
no
lasting
finish
to
speak
of
though
im
not
sure
i
wanted
one
i
would
not
purchase
this
beer
poured
a
light
hazy
pinkish
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
and
some
lacing
weak
raspberry
smell
no
wheat
malt
weak
raspberry
taste
watery
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
it
was
like
drinking
a
watered
down
fruit
juice
definitely
skip
this
one
if
your
looking
for
a
raspberry
wheat
beer
ugly
pinkish
purple
color
but
with
a
respectable
head
the
smell
is
not
terrible
very
wheaty
taste
is
very
subtle
with
the
raspberry
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
this
when
my
friend
brought
it
over
because
i
dont
know
of
a
nonbelgian
beer
that
doesnt
butcher
fruit
beers
so
the
subtlety
of
the
raspberry
was
welcome
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
thin
and
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
track
down
for
any
reason
thoroughly
unimpressed
with
this
beer
in
all
honesty
this
beer
tastes
like
newspaper
which
i
have
tasted
before
so
trust
me
on
that
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
on
back
label
had
a
light
grapefruit
color
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
quickly
went
away
the
smell
was
awful
it
had
the
standard
abita
skunk
base
with
a
sickly
fruity
smell
on
top
of
it
the
taste
was
even
worse
really
dont
see
the
appeal
or
reason
for
this
beer
there
are
several
fruit
beers
that
i
love
but
this
aint
close
to
being
one
of
em
1
5
na
ml
n
there
are
much
better
wheat
beers
out
there
d
not
great
not
that
bad
somewhat
thirstquenching
quality
watered
down
malt
and
wheat
taste
though
very
pungent
nasty
skunky
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
overcarbonated
wasnt
a
drinkable
beer
i
had
trouble
drinking
the
entire
bottle
it
had
a
value
macrolager
rather
than
a
flovored
wheat
beer
taste
to
it
had
this
on
a
whim
and
i
dont
regret
it
wispy
head
with
a
purplishamber
color
to
it
slight
smell
of
berries
and
a
tartishberry
taste
to
it
simple
not
overpowering
light
refreshing
enjoyable
ill
have
this
again
for
sure
d
not
bad
but
smells
better
than
it
tastes
sorry
gals
taste
is
small
on
the
raspberryfruity
notes
its
wheaty
and
a
bit
watereddown
feels
light
and
not
as
bubbly
as
the
appearance
lets
on
no
aftertaste
yet
very
refreshing
as
for
the
drinkability
it
has
little
to
no
complexity
but
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
in
bulk
too
if
need
be
this
poured
to
a
a
plum
color
with
a
light
lacy
body
the
little
head
that
it
had
disappeared
quickly
it
appeared
thin
and
watery
and
a
bit
muddy
there
is
a
hint
of
tartness
and
the
raspberry
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
but
subtle
it
has
nice
flavor
it
seems
to
get
better
with
subsequent
sips
i
wouldnt
a
lot
of
these
in
one
session
but
the
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
pinkish
head
whihc
was
quite
interesting
okay
retention
not
too
fast
but
not
slow
a
very
nice
raspberry
jamlike
smell
that
was
quite
appealing
and
intriguing
the
first
taste
was
a
little
rough
on
the
palette
at
first
probably
due
to
the
tartness
of
the
reaspberries
but
settles
down
to
a
nice
raspberry
tasting
brew
that
it
just
pleasant
and
easygoing
mouthfeel
was
okay
maybe
a
little
on
the
thin
side
not
much
to
really
brag
about
the
beer
however
is
very
smooth
going
down
and
is
pleasant
to
drink
the
fact
that
its
a
raspberry
beer
makes
it
a
very
fun
and
interesting
beer
havent
had
too
many
fruitvegetable
beers
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
tastes
of
a
very
light
lager
almost
beer
hard
to
say
that
this
is
a
real
wheat
beer
the
raspberry
comes
through
in
the
mouth
but
not
very
much
at
all
a
light
hoppy
bitterness
to
follow
i
would
prefer
it
to
have
just
a
tad
more
raspberry
to
help
highlight
the
fact
that
this
is
a
wheat
beer
a
little
to
filtered
as
well
for
wheat
will
make
a
great
summer
beer
this
brew
is
decently
carbonated
and
promotes
a
wet
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
behind
a
little
lacing
to
the
end
the
body
is
only
slightly
hazy
and
has
a
slight
purple
tint
to
it
this
gives
off
a
very
syrupy
and
slight
raspberry
aroma
i
can
detect
characters
of
the
yeast
too
this
brew
tastes
very
watery
i
cant
really
detect
the
raspberry
flavor
except
for
in
the
aftertaste
this
brew
is
a
bit
too
wet
for
my
taste
too
wet
one
of
several
beers
that
i
got
from
my
brotherinlaw
when
they
had
to
move
its
funny
because
i
bought
this
in
a
6
pak
a
few
years
ago
during
my
miller
lite
days
and
didnt
like
it
so
i
gave
it
to
him
he
ended
up
not
drinking
it
and
now
its
back
to
me
which
im
glad
since
my
taste
in
beer
has
radically
changed
since
then
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
light
pinkpurple
color
forming
a
very
slight
head
that
left
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
raspberry
if
theres
anything
else
there
its
covered
up
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
being
dominated
by
the
raspberries
but
maybe
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
back
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
not
one
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
at
a
time
even
though
the
mouth
is
ok
im
in
no
rush
to
buy
this
again
dirnakbility
good
a
decent
session
beer
if
you
would
like
would
get
this
one
again
with
food
not
a
solo
beer
had
this
one
at
barleys
tonight
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
over
the
top
fruity
the
taste
was
as
well
for
some
reason
i
thought
this
would
have
been
a
bit
more
mellow
slight
hoppiness
in
the
finish
but
all
i
really
could
get
out
of
this
was
the
fruitiness
wont
be
going
back
to
this
anytime
soon
a
decent
american
wheat
beer
i
believe
the
scent
of
this
beer
is
one
of
its
best
qualities
i
enjoy
a
fruity
brew
every
so
often
fruity
brews
also
go
well
for
the
ladies
keep
that
in
mind
overall
the
rasberry
flavor
was
gone
as
soon
as
it
came
it
didnt
stick
around
if
youre
impressed
with
a
cherry
wheat
sam
adams
then
youre
not
going
to
be
real
impressed
with
this
high
notes
are
smooth
not
a
heavy
beer
exceptional
aroma
i
had
this
at
the
bar
while
watching
the
game
i
never
had
it
before
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
well
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
has
a
great
amberish
color
and
the
smell
was
fruity
and
nice
the
proof
is
in
the
taste
and
this
one
tasted
really
good
it
wasnt
overly
heavy
and
so
i
was
able
to
woof
down
some
food
whilst
drinking
it
overall
it
is
an
ok
beer
and
one
i
suggest
when
you
want
fruity
beer
i
got
this
in
a
party
pack
and
thought
i
would
try
it
first
as
the
name
indicates
i
think
this
one
was
aimed
at
kids
the
head
quickly
disipates
and
there
is
no
lacing
cloudy
appearance
i
cant
hardly
discride
the
appearance
or
the
taste
this
is
not
one
that
i
would
have
bought
on
my
own
nor
will
i
be
persuaded
to
buy
this
in
the
future
its
not
so
bad
that
im
going
to
pour
it
down
the
sink
and
i
will
drink
the
other
one
but
this
beer
is
not
in
my
future
drinkability
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
sitting
around
in
the
summertime
not
the
best
thing
to
have
in
mid
november
but
the
weather
has
been
warm
lately
poured
out
a
yellow
golden
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
nose
was
sweet
with
some
berry
raspberry
cassis
and
sugar
sweetness
not
much
in
the
taste
ofthe
beer
some
malt
a
slight
berry
flavor
but
tastes
more
like
macro
lager
than
anything
else
has
some
strong
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
got
this
12
ounze
bottle
from
an
abita
party
pack
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
no
head
at
all
and
no
lace
to
mention
either
it
poured
a
nice
cloudy
goldish
color
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
aroma
the
taste
was
that
of
purple
i
didnt
get
much
raspberry
flavor
just
the
sense
that
i
was
drinking
purple
which
wasnt
bad
at
all
i
quite
liked
it
actually
the
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
rigid
decent
brew
not
awsome
dont
drink
and
review
pours
pink
a
lovely
colour
too
because
of
the
lack
of
head
this
doesnt
even
closely
resemble
a
beer
even
fruit
beer
at
all
very
hazy
lovely
appearence
smells
like
a
lager
with
trace
syrop
flavouring
my
first
impression
was
of
a
freezie
the
fruit
flavour
was
clearly
artificial
that
artificiality
would
be
consistent
in
the
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
was
high
carbonated
lack
of
texture
whos
kidding
who
this
is
just
a
macro
lager
with
some
artificial
flavouring
dont
get
me
wrong
i
liked
it
but
its
far
from
something
id
call
a
good
fruit
beer
that
overlooked
its
rather
enjoyable
no
offense
of
course
notes
in
the
end
its
fairly
crips
but
nothing
about
this
brew
is
all
that
interesting
purple
haze
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
but
very
active
carbonation
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
twist
off
bottle
you
can
smell
the
rasberry
but
this
beer
doesnt
smell
good
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
light
raspberry
followed
by
a
good
wheat
flavor
not
bad
not
great
worth
a
try
overall
definitely
drinkable
putting
down
several
in
one
sitting
would
not
be
hard
but
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
poured
bottle
of
purple
haze
into
a
pint
glass
head
was
very
fizzy
and
was
gone
pretty
quickly
beer
is
a
hazy
orange
with
heavy
carbanation
smell
is
of
corn
and
raspberry
also
some
sweet
nectar
smell
as
well
taste
is
of
cabonation
with
a
slight
rasberry
taste
to
it
really
other
than
the
carbination
there
is
not
much
going
on
in
here
it
kind
of
taste
like
selzter
water
i
would
drink
again
but
i
would
never
pay
for
it
drinkabilityoverall
an
easydrinking
hohum
flavored
wheat
beer
nothing
great
nothing
offensive
its
beer
girls
might
like
it
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
is
overwhelmingly
berry
like
and
slightly
floral
the
taste
is
delicate
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
is
a
smooth
beer
which
i
can
seeing
enjoying
from
time
to
time
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
but
too
watery
and
the
aftertaste
is
bland
and
boring
taste
is
light
and
wheaty
with
a
brief
hint
of
berry
juice
in
fairness
lacing
has
appeared
at
this
point
i
wouldnt
say
theres
too
much
carbonation
but
what
little
there
is
outweighs
the
lightweight
taste
i
dare
say
jimi
wouldnt
travel
by
dragonfly
to
drink
this
watery
confused
wannabe
mh
9
pours
a
hazy
peachorange
color
with
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
raspberry
is
the
most
noticeable
aroma
but
there
is
a
hint
of
wheat
also
taste
is
bland
the
raspberry
flavor
i
expected
from
the
smell
is
very
muted
there
is
some
bitterness
also
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
like
the
hop
bitterness
i
taste
in
other
brews
decent
carbonation
but
maybe
a
little
watery
probably
an
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
after
enjoying
many
other
of
abitas
beers
edited
to
add
it
occurred
to
me
that
since
it
was
on
sale
it
is
possible
that
the
keg
had
been
around
for
a
while
and
thus
influenced
the
taste
so
take
this
as
a
warning
to
both
drinker
and
brewer
alike
that
some
bars
may
be
doing
your
beer
a
disservice
tastes
like
rasberry
sparkling
water
with
a
slight
beer
flavor
added
clings
to
the
mouth
decently
easy
to
drink
but
would
want
a
different
brew
after
a
couple
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
brew
for
what
it
was
a
wheat
beer
with
a
rasberry
hit
dont
make
it
out
to
be
something
more
and
you
wont
be
depressed
d
there
you
have
it
drinkability
it
did
make
for
a
nice
decent
fruit
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
im
not
even
sure
i
bought
this
one
because
there
really
wasnt
much
going
on
in
this
beer
if
you
like
malted
wheat
with
a
subtle
taste
of
raspberries
then
this
is
your
beer
a
bar
pour
into
a
straight
pint
glass
yields
a
head
consisting
of
only
a
glass
ring
the
beers
body
is
mildly
transparent
and
is
a
dark
hazy
copper
smells
of
sweet
malt
prunes
cinnamon
caramel
apples
and
also
a
bit
sour
the
taste
starts
at
raspberry
tartness
moves
through
malt
grain
to
a
sweet
froot
loop
aftertaste
combined
with
a
good
biscuit
flavor
the
mouth
is
very
light
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
a
fun
easy
to
drink
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
complexity
to
it
nice
color
too
it
scent
is
great
smells
fruity
and
has
a
sweet
taste
too
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
very
good
stuff
if
you
are
just
looking
to
enjoy
a
beer
and
not
actually
taste
the
beer
drinkability
to
each
his
own
i
guess
this
isnt
one
i
would
get
again
i
havent
had
too
many
american
wheat
beers
i
have
cared
for
but
this
one
just
couldnt
do
anything
for
me
the
only
appeasing
part
was
the
smell
which
was
very
misleading
a
fancy
label
and
name
sells
the
beer
not
the
beer
itself
overall
an
overly
simple
raspberry
beer
not
a
horrible
beer
but
there
is
much
better
choices
out
there
thin
but
very
crisp
feel
if
this
only
tasted
better
this
could
be
the
best
hotweather
brew
ive
ever
tried
incredibly
refreshing
but
the
flavor
is
jut
too
shallow
i
dont
know
why
this
is
the
only
abita
brew
available
at
every
decent
liquor
store
in
southern
california
im
sure
theyve
got
something
better
than
this
this
was
almost
like
drinking
fresh
water
with
a
touch
of
raspberry
it
goes
down
easily
but
so
does
water
overall
too
watery
and
boring
imo
lavender
stained
nectarine
short
but
long
lasting
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
steady
walls
of
carbonation
race
upwards
a
few
angel
hair
threads
of
lacing
are
left
dry
wispy
raspberry
note
with
some
sharp
tartness
fills
the
nose
along
with
just
a
bit
of
wheat
initially
the
raspberries
rise
but
in
a
suggestive
rather
than
forceful
way
there
is
a
tart
crisp
component
that
compliments
as
well
as
a
slight
lemon
pith
taste
the
finish
is
dry
and
maintains
the
lightness
while
being
crisp
and
refreshing
mediumlight
body
with
mouth
scrubbing
carbonation
which
works
well
drinkable
enjoyable
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
sticky
virginia
afternoon
d
not
bad
not
good
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
bring
it
to
a
house
party
with
budmiller
drinkers
especially
if
women
will
be
there
however
youll
never
see
me
showing
off
at
the
homebrew
club
rarely
do
i
enjoy
a
flavored
beer
this
one
is
a
bit
different
it
looks
like
an
old
beer
or
that
green
tea
you
get
at
a
chinese
restaurant
or
something
when
you
pour
it
to
a
glass
its
got
a
purple
tint
not
much
head
either
the
smell
has
some
raspberry
scent
w
a
woodsy
type
smell
behind
it
now
the
taste
is
different
not
the
typical
beer
but
not
bad
its
actually
pretty
decent
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
still
it
is
ok
and
i
have
nothing
against
it
glad
i
tried
it
now
all
i
can
do
is
hope
that
the
other
abita
beers
are
more
interesting
i
like
it
i
would
surely
drink
it
again
if
offered
and
may
even
buy
it
again
someday
if
the
mood
strikes
drinks
okay
for
the
style
fruitty
beers
arent
my
thing
wont
knock
it
too
much
this
stuff
went
down
pretty
easy
when
i
was
in
auburn
alabama
this
the
amber
were
the
only
thing
of
interest
i
found
i
generally
dont
like
fruit
beers
this
one
is
better
than
sa
cherry
wheat
but
not
something
i
would
get
again
its
a
peachishorangishpink
but
not
purple
the
color
is
fairly
ugly
in
my
opinion
the
small
white
foamy
quicktodiminish
head
didnt
help
it
smells
like
a
wheatflavored
sweettart
with
fruit
juice
and
berry
being
most
notable
tastes
of
sweet
raspberry
wheat
and
some
weak
grain
with
a
lightly
tart
finish
it
has
a
mediumthin
body
watery
texture
and
low
carbonation
i
guess
its
sort
of
refreshing
in
some
way
but
definitely
not
satisfying
to
me
rather
boring
and
weak
and
flavors
that
werent
really
weak
were
unimpressive
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
for
people
that
dont
really
like
beer
i
dont
get
this
one
pours
out
to
a
medium
orange
pink
hued
color
with
an
initially
large
head
of
white
foam
that
quickly
calms
to
a
small
layer
of
bubbles
over
the
beer
medium
to
medium
high
carbonation
aromas
of
raspberries
malt
grain
biscuts
taste
is
boring
but
not
offensive
weak
malt
a
drop
of
fruitiness
some
light
grain
and
thats
all
folks
mouthfeel
was
slightly
bubbly
and
rather
light
drinkability
is
fair
at
best
what
was
abita
going
for
with
this
one
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
strong
pink
tint
nice
white
headstrange
looking
beer
the
aroma
has
some
notes
of
raspberry
puree
wheat
yeast
and
some
cane
sugar
interesting
the
flavor
is
wheaty
upfront
with
some
raspberry
and
sugar
notes
in
the
background
along
with
some
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
excellent
a
very
drinkable
wheat
beer
with
some
mild
fruit
flavors
solid
d
easy
enough
to
drink
although
i
dont
think
id
really
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
intense
fruityness
but
because
the
hops
and
malt
are
dulled
out
it
makes
the
beer
an
average
one
all
in
all
this
is
a
pleasant
summertime
brew
the
lager
could
have
been
a
bit
lighter
the
beer
could
have
been
fizzier
and
the
color
could
have
been
at
least
somewhat
purple
but
still
id
enjoy
drinking
this
while
swinging
in
a
hammock
musings
i
buy
just
about
every
fruit
beer
i
can
get
my
hands
on
for
my
wife
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
dry
clean
and
simple
with
true
to
life
raspberry
taste
pours
a
hazy
peach
color
very
slightly
lavender
i
suppose
thin
rim
of
head
huge
berry
flower
smell
excessively
fizzy
crisp
body
not
exactly
dry
but
light
and
bitey
the
berry
flavor
is
definitely
prominent
but
its
not
syrupy
actually
theres
almost
not
enough
raspberry
lindemans
framboise
this
is
not
the
wheat
and
malt
flavors
still
show
through
along
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
its
not
necessarily
a
winning
combination
still
its
a
blazing
hot
day
in
southern
california
this
is
a
light
tasty
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
a
couple
more
for
the
new
englander
basically
a
thinner
mh
9
except
raspberry
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
it
is
also
pretty
tasty
it
has
a
raspberry
tartness
upfront
and
finishes
with
graininess
and
raspberry
syrup
it
is
a
little
thin
but
there
is
nothing
objectionable
here
and
it
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
strange
little
beer
that
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
traces
of
purple
the
head
is
short
lived
it
smells
a
bit
like
a
blow
pop
and
beer
combined
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
tastes
like
if
you
are
into
speciality
beers
and
like
fruity
tastes
go
ahead
and
try
it
if
the
idea
of
drinking
a
beer
while
eating
blow
pop
turns
you
off
id
go
ahead
and
skip
it
it
pours
a
very
pale
color
and
is
quite
cloudy
the
taste
is
not
nearly
as
yeasty
as
expected
but
the
fruit
flavor
is
prevailent
and
masks
the
taste
of
the
beer
itself
leaving
a
bland
aftertaste
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
because
it
is
a
great
choice
for
a
summer
brew
on
a
hot
day
and
especially
for
the
ladies
and
dare
i
say
the
guys
who
insist
on
anything
but
beer
a
weird
pinkish
color
makes
me
seriously
wonder
if
im
drinking
grapefruit
juice
i
understand
this
is
a
raspberry
wheat
beer
but
this
just
looks
like
something
a
kid
threw
together
not
much
to
smell
here
but
maybe
thats
the
bar
atmosphere
not
that
im
complaining
i
love
the
flying
saucer
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
just
nothing
there
i
could
get
a
very
slight
yeasty
front
followed
up
and
finished
with
a
very
tart
sweetness
that
pains
the
stomach
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
which
made
this
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
make
it
very
drinkable
the
fire
sale
has
screwed
me
again
pours
a
dull
cantalope
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
mostly
rasberry
and
citrus
with
a
little
doughy
smell
in
there
tastes
the
same
mostly
rasberry
with
a
strong
wheat
finish
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
brings
out
a
good
amount
of
flavor
a
very
inviting
beer
that
is
good
for
all
to
try
a
good
mouthfeel
and
overall
easy
consumption
this
isnt
the
most
amazing
beer
but
definitely
worth
a
try
it
has
subtle
flavors
and
a
great
balance
check
this
beer
out
if
you
get
a
chance
this
is
an
easier
drinking
more
balanced
brew
than
i
was
ever
expecting
i
thought
id
have
a
sip
or
two
and
have
to
swear
this
one
off
forever
but
im
happy
to
say
that
id
gladly
sample
this
one
again
and
itd
certainly
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
brew
in
the
summer
m
d
slick
mouthfeel
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
drinkable
but
there
are
other
ones
out
there
that
i
would
have
first
this
one
could
be
a
decent
refreshing
summer
time
brew
pours
pale
orange
very
cloudy
peachypurple
tinted
head
of
dense
foam
reaches
one
finger
in
height
and
holds
well
leaving
a
few
specs
of
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
very
weak
with
just
a
hint
of
raspberry
and
wheat
and
the
taste
is
similiar
pretty
bland
imho
the
aftertaste
hints
at
dryness
but
with
no
hop
flavor
whatsoever
just
a
lingering
but
mild
raspberry
taste
that
manages
to
be
not
sweet
nor
tart
the
finish
is
mostly
clean
but
the
fruit
pulp
becomes
somewhat
chalky
and
leaves
a
scummy
film
the
mouthfeel
is
otherwise
decent
with
a
medium
crispness
and
smooth
body
the
drinkability
isnt
necessarily
harsh
but
this
really
dissapoints
as
a
summertime
fruit
beer
the
bee
empties
from
the
stubby
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
modest
sized
off
white
head
that
after
its
demise
leaves
a
thin
but
concealing
sheet
of
lace
nose
has
a
berry
like
sweetness
hints
of
cracked
wheat
and
a
nice
fresh
crispness
start
is
sweet
the
grain
profile
pleasant
and
the
top
light
in
feel
finish
is
light
to
medium
in
its
acidity
the
hops
light
but
pleasant
the
aftertaste
dry
a
nice
refreshing
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
the
raspberry
recalls
more
of
the
seeds
than
the
fruit
and
the
wheat
character
matches
the
grainy
aroma
you
might
catch
in
the
elephant
house
of
your
local
zoo
d
could
drink
it
all
night
like
an
american
light
beer
though
i
would
recommend
other
wheat
beers
and
other
rasp
beers
but
together
this
one
is
not
bad
but
not
good
either
drinkability
probably
phs
strongest
attribute
thin
bright
and
light
this
one
is
a
great
summer
quencher
could
line
up
a
few
for
a
day
out
in
the
yard
there
are
however
many
better
tasting
beers
with
these
attributes
drinkabilitymouthfeel
i
am
one
that
like
carbonation
especially
in
the
summer
and
it
makes
this
an
easy
to
drink
wheat
lager
extremely
refreshing
it
might
even
be
a
good
beer
to
help
introduce
someone
to
a
fruitwheat
beeror
craft
beer
in
general
pours
a
orange
pink
haze
with
a
white
cap
that
was
gone
fast
faint
bouquet
with
wheat
fruity
esters
and
malty
sweetness
faint
raspberry
flavor
was
a
musty
biscuit
with
a
sour
citrus
and
very
light
raspberry
notes
very
fake
sweetness
flavor
that
just
gave
it
a
very
bland
empty
feeling
in
the
mouth
watery
with
medlight
carbonation
finished
with
a
dull
dry
feeling
i
hope
i
dont
have
to
go
through
this
again
not
really
a
bad
drink
but
in
many
ways
more
like
drinking
a
bottle
of
flavored
selzer
or
soda
than
it
is
a
beer
probobly
great
to
drink
on
a
sorching
hot
summer
day
ive
never
been
impressed
with
any
abita
beer
save
the
restoration
ale
but
this
is
the
worst
offering
from
them
i
have
ever
tasted
seriously
what
the
fuck
really
only
good
on
tap
drinkable
but
i
simply
dont
want
to
i
remember
this
beer
being
alot
better
oh
well
glad
i
stole
it
from
my
girlfriends
stash
d
pours
a
hazy
gold
from
the
bottle
with
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
noteable
carbonation
its
not
noticeably
purple
the
raspberries
really
dominant
the
aroma
of
this
cant
detect
much
besides
raspberry
besides
a
little
mild
wheat
this
fruit
beer
manages
a
fairly
good
balance
in
the
taste
department
its
not
overpowerlingly
fruity
but
the
fruit
definitely
comes
across
for
me
not
very
drinkable
but
i
bet
a
lot
of
girls
would
like
this
one
body
is
between
light
and
medium
is
well
carbonated
with
a
soft
wheaty
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
grainey
texture
although
one
dimensionable
its
very
unassuming
and
easy
to
quaff
ive
had
a
few
of
these
and
no
two
pours
have
yielded
the
same
color
scheme
so
far
ive
seen
a
light
purple
and
a
orangishreddish
pour
both
had
nice
foamy
heads
i
love
raspberries
so
the
lingering
smell
was
delightful
tasted
very
fruity
definitely
an
afterdinner
or
desert
beer
for
me
mouthfeel
was
good
very
smooth
with
little
carbonation
hazy
amber
dont
see
much
pink
tint
but
the
lights
were
a
little
low
not
really
any
head
or
retention
smells
like
sweet
adjunct
ala
rolling
rock
bleck
taste
is
fairly
smooth
but
im
not
getting
any
fruit
out
of
it
again
theres
a
definate
adjunct
factor
here
its
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
but
it
tastes
like
a
dressed
up
cornmacro
the
appearance
was
a
bit
off
setting
i
dont
like
seeing
plum
color
to
my
beer
even
if
it
is
suppossed
to
have
fruit
the
smell
was
of
a
good
lager
with
a
hint
of
the
berries
very
nice
the
taste
like
i
said
was
very
good
i
think
i
liked
this
better
because
instead
of
being
made
with
too
sweet
of
a
fruit
flavor
that
let
the
berries
replace
some
hop
bitterness
with
a
tart
flavor
that
was
very
good
i
would
still
rather
have
a
regular
beer
but
this
was
pretty
good
i
find
that
a
single
beer
has
two
identities
one
on
tap
and
one
bottled
this
is
a
beer
that
is
better
on
tap
pass
if
you
see
it
in
the
bottle
but
it
may
be
worth
a
try
on
tap
poured
with
a
hazy
light
pinkishpurplish
color
into
an
average
pint
glass
has
a
pretty
average
smell
to
it
with
a
hint
of
the
raspberry
flavor
that
is
contained
within
has
a
clean
taste
with
a
bit
of
raspberry
flavor
that
reveals
itself
to
you
slowly
as
your
drink
it
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
its
a
perfect
beer
to
take
the
edge
off
a
hot
summer
dayor
a
hot
meal
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
amazing
beer
but
it
definitely
has
its
place
in
my
beer
fridge
it
poured
a
very
odd
color
a
purple
haze
as
the
name
suggests
well
actually
it
was
more
of
a
murky
pink
but
theres
no
hendrix
song
they
could
attached
that
to
it
wasnt
very
appealing
it
had
a
wheaty
aroma
with
hints
of
raspberry
the
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
somewhat
watery
more
iced
tea
than
beer
it
is
tart
with
a
light
body
the
small
6
oz
sample
was
plenty
this
wasnt
something
i
would
drink
often
i
cant
believe
i
wasted
15
bucks
on
their
party
pack
so
far
full
of
dissapointments
and
halfway
through
last
nights
i
ended
up
with
a
migrane
i
blame
it
on
the
brew
it
pours
an
offcolor
red
with
a
good
sized
frothy
head
the
nose
is
malty
with
hints
of
fruit
quite
nice
but
then
it
falls
flat
the
taste
is
rough
and
sorry
to
say
kinda
just
falls
flat
then
the
hops
hit
like
a
train
wreck
i
am
not
sure
what
the
fuss
is
about
with
abita
but
this
is
just
kinda
average
to
bad
appearance
was
just
slightly
hazy
but
very
clean
looking
for
a
wheat
style
beer
color
was
an
apricot
honey
shade
with
an
interesting
light
purple
shade
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
head
receded
quickly
but
cling
was
nice
aroma
was
of
artificial
raspberries
bread
dank
hops
and
yeast
taste
was
of
raspberry
flavor
mostly
but
much
like
it
smelled
with
a
bready
aftertaste
and
dank
hops
suspended
in
the
brew
mouthfeel
was
smooth
to
watery
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
before
trying
but
really
not
bad
you
know
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
shouldnt
like
but
i
do
normally
i
dont
gravitate
to
fruity
american
beers
that
are
not
belgiumstyled
or
lambic
in
nature
what
can
i
say
its
quirky
and
i
like
it
it
has
a
very
high
drinkability
it
pours
cloudy
amber
with
very
light
reddishpink
yea
maybe
light
purple
hazy
look
it
smells
like
a
breakfast
cereal
with
a
light
fruity
smell
it
has
a
light
head
in
my
mug
with
little
carbonation
going
it
tastes
light
and
refreshing
with
an
overtone
of
raspberry
almost
like
a
candyraspberry
its
almost
like
beer
coolaide
like
i
said
i
shouldnt
like
but
i
do
on
days
im
not
too
serious
and
want
to
just
quaff
a
few
pints
of
a
light
beer
i
sometimes
make
it
purple
haze
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
id
say
its
just
as
drinkable
as
bud
miller
or
coors
since
it
goes
down
like
water
how
can
it
be
hard
to
drink
i
probably
wont
ever
buy
this
beer
again
i
just
hope
that
my
homebrew
is
better
than
this
i
dont
think
that
itll
have
much
of
a
problem
tasting
better
than
this
the
standard
has
been
set
pretty
low
with
this
one
not
a
great
head
but
an
exceptional
beer
goes
well
with
any
cajun
food
and
is
great
on
tap
it
is
a
raspberry
beer
so
dont
expect
anything
traditional
but
it
is
a
bit
stronger
than
an
average
beer
and
has
a
great
taste
it
is
not
incredibly
complex
but
as
far
as
raspberry
beers
it
is
the
best
but
then
again
i
am
from
la
but
i
would
say
it
goes
best
w
crawfish
etouffee
solid
w
lsu
football
order
it
at
the
chimes
in
baton
rouge
and
relax
very
sentimental
beer
for
me
considering
i
got
my
first
one
when
i
could
drink
legally
at
18
cloudy
golden
colored
with
a
hint
of
pink
no
head
just
a
laced
circle
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
smell
was
part
fruity
and
part
grainy
didnt
have
the
raspberry
omph
that
i
expected
taste
is
wheat
up
front
with
a
fruity
medicine
like
aftertaste
felt
thin
and
a
little
syrupy
in
the
mouth
i
simply
just
did
not
like
this
beer
if
you
like
it
you
could
probably
throw
a
few
down
maybe
would
be
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
tastes
like
iced
tea
with
a
slight
raspberry
flavor
poured
a
hazy
orange
with
a
tinge
of
you
guessed
it
purple
not
much
of
a
head
mouthfeel
was
fairly
flat
but
it
was
expansive
on
the
tongue
aroma
is
little
bits
of
wheat
and
raspberrybut
not
lots
of
either
flavor
reminds
me
of
iced
raspberry
tea
little
bitter
but
more
sweet
from
the
frit
and
the
wheat
the
raspberry
is
also
more
of
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
than
the
bitterness
of
the
fruit
6pack
from
biglove
poured
true
to
its
name
a
hazy
light
purple
with
a
small
withe
head
aroma
sour
fruits
witha
touch
of
sugar
added
raspberries
sligt
hints
of
malt
flavor
sour
raspberries
and
other
sour
fruits
dry
this
is
another
one
of
their
beers
that
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
you
want
to
throw
down
a
few
not
an
every
day
thing
but
good
enough
to
be
in
the
outer
rotation
this
isnt
really
my
favorite
style
but
overall
id
say
its
an
ok
beer
kind
of
odd
but
refreshing
in
its
own
little
way
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
similar
to
other
hefeweizens
copious
creamy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
no
precipitating
carbonation
but
a
slight
amount
of
yeast
residue
barelythere
nose
primarily
of
wheat
definite
blueberry
flavor
on
the
first
taste
yet
not
too
sweet
this
is
the
predominate
flavor
none
of
the
usual
citrus
flavor
associated
with
other
witbiers
ive
tasted
or
any
other
bite
for
that
matter
watery
mildly
bubbly
mouthfeel
no
discernable
aftertaste
drinkablility
is
excellent
it
is
tasty
and
refreshing
however
overall
too
much
is
missing
making
it
an
above
average
but
hardly
noteworthy
brew
probably
a
good
beer
to
get
your
macro
friends
to
try
drinkability
except
for
the
nose
i
actually
like
this
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
it
regularly
but
it
is
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
criticism
among
serious
beer
lovers
yet
its
one
of
the
best
selling
micros
out
there
having
reveiwed
it
once
before
i
am
revisiting
the
growler
version
looks
like
grapefruit
juice
poured
a
cloudy
pinkish
color
and
released
a
dainty
white
head
that
laced
well
smells
sweetly
berrylike
has
some
sour
notes
from
the
fermentationgreen
apple
like
tastes
mildly
sweet
of
berries
and
adjuncts
of
corn
or
rye
citrus
grapefruit
and
tart
raspberry
and
green
apples
mildly
spicy
of
corriander
low
hop
flavor
but
moderate
bittering
that
chases
into
the
finish
body
tapers
from
creamy
to
thin
in
the
finish
finishes
cleanly
bittered
grapefruit
rinds
no
presence
of
alcohol
and
a
light
aftertaste
this
one
is
growing
on
me
although
you
wont
see
it
in
my
cart
anytime
soon
cloudystraw
colored
with
a
touch
of
pink
no
real
head
present
low
fruity
aroma
slight
rasberry
smell
but
it
doesnt
scream
at
you
some
malt
flavor
but
the
fruit
comes
thru
more
so
tart
sort
of
one
dimensional
average
bodyweakalmost
watery
very
ho
hum
overalltheres
definately
better
fruit
beers
out
there
i
dont
even
see
this
one
a
decent
hot
weather
beer
purple
haze
the
nonpurple
beer
it
pours
a
pinkish
orangish
color
looks
like
juice
the
very
white
head
looks
striking
against
the
juicyness
and
the
bubbles
they
never
go
away
its
great
smell
is
sweet
fruity
mostly
raspberries
taste
is
fruity
and
berry
as
well
but
a
weird
off
aftertaste
garbagey
like
stale
soda
its
not
overwhelming
but
it
definitely
makes
me
hesitate
in
opening
another
mouthfeel
is
light
but
a
little
watery
overall
an
okay
beer
but
the
aftertaste
kills
it
for
me
a
decent
summer
type
brew
that
may
appeal
to
non
beer
drinkers
pours
a
dull
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
cap
of
head
and
a
little
lacing
smell
is
a
light
rasberry
over
a
wheat
background
and
little
off
skunkiness
taste
is
pretty
malty
upfront
but
then
a
rasberry
tartness
hits
you
at
the
end
not
very
strong
rasberry
but
whats
their
is
too
sour
and
articificial
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
rather
fizzy
picked
this
beer
up
because
i
liked
the
name
and
cant
say
id
do
it
again
uf
poured
a
light
rasberry
color
with
large
white
head
smell
is
of
berries
taste
is
a
tart
berry
flavor
that
causes
a
dry
fell
in
the
mouth
not
much
to
talk
about
with
this
beer
seems
like
i
could
do
the
same
by
adding
a
little
cranberry
juice
to
my
beer
dn
a
beer
that
a
fruit
beer
lover
like
myself
could
quaff
all
day
super
easy
drinking
nice
flavors
and
aromas
if
you
like
fruit
beers
dont
pass
this
one
up
its
ok
dog
d
for
the
summer
this
beer
is
a
simple
and
smooth
drinker
refreshing
and
crisp
in
the
taste
and
well
represented
in
the
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
on
the
market
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
bright
white
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
golden
brew
head
lasts
well
and
laces
excellently
for
a
fruit
beer
aroma
is
lightly
fruity
with
a
sweet
malty
almost
adjuncty
tinge
to
it
taste
is
light
malts
with
a
crisp
fruitiness
and
a
dry
finish
seems
like
it
would
be
somewhat
thirstquenching
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
the
drinkability
falls
off
a
bit
due
to
the
fruitiness
perhaps
getting
old
after
a
bit
notes
the
raspberry
flavor
is
a
little
to
artificial
tasting
hazy
orange
color
with
some
raspberry
highlights
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
head
starts
off
good
but
then
sizzles
down
to
a
small
lace
probably
a
result
of
the
acidity
raspberry
juice
added
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
raspberry
tartness
and
soft
grains
the
first
thing
i
notice
in
the
taste
is
a
raspberry
tartness
but
not
over
done
however
soft
grains
follow
afterwards
and
a
semidry
finish
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
a
little
acidic
i
am
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
must
say
i
enjoy
purple
haze
this
is
because
no
flavors
are
over
done
or
come
off
as
fake
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
little
carbonation
and
a
thin
lace
of
head
smell
is
all
raspberries
and
is
pleasant
but
nothing
special
taste
is
is
quite
bland
and
a
little
disappointing
because
its
weaker
than
the
smell
its
a
a
little
dry
and
could
be
a
little
sweeter
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
its
perfectly
carbonated
slightly
dry
and
you
can
actually
taste
the
beer
before
you
even
swallow
it
drinkability
is
only
a
little
average
because
it
has
great
mouthfeel
and
smell
but
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
this
beer
pours
a
light
orangish
color
with
a
weaker
fizzy
head
aroma
is
cereal
grainy
and
a
slight
fruity
undertone
but
i
couldnt
describe
what
fruit
it
was
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
raspberry
beer
until
about
midway
through
which
shows
how
subdued
the
raspberry
character
was
much
more
of
a
wheat
beer
than
a
fruit
beer
fruit
seems
like
syrup
and
a
little
artificial
but
not
terribly
cloying
lighter
bodied
and
a
little
fizzy
finish
is
moderately
acidic
and
rather
forgetable
i
could
drink
about
two
of
these
before
getting
bored
and
moving
on
i
could
have
maybe
two
of
these
max
in
one
session
maybe
it
was
the
95
degree
heat
outside
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
refreshing
easy
drinker
i
would
have
no
problem
having
one
from
timetotime
drinkable
especially
ice
cold
thanx
4da
beer
biglove
picked
this
up
from
to
your
health
coralville
so
i
could
compare
a
raspberry
wheat
i
recently
made
to
a
commerical
example
poured
a
two
finger
pure
white
head
over
a
very
cloudy
light
dirt
rust
liquid
i
stirred
the
sediment
and
poured
it
in
smells
were
limited
to
raspberry
with
an
acrid
quality
about
it
taste
was
smooth
and
sweet
cool
and
nicely
raspberry
raspberry
started
from
the
getgo
and
was
a
gentle
presence
throughout
clove
was
hidden
beneath
the
raspberry
aside
from
that
all
i
could
get
was
a
watery
flavor
and
maybe
some
pear
on
the
tongue
md
light
mouthfeel
and
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
this
would
be
easy
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
to
get
exceited
about
just
a
pleasant
beer
overall
impression
thanks
to
biglove
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
nice
light
summer
brew
good
berry
flavor
without
being
artificially
sweet
one
of
my
friends
came
over
with
a
new
beer
tonight
after
i
had
already
had
quite
a
rough
session
of
my
own
including
another
new
beer
this
one
was
a
somewhat
dark
for
a
wheat
but
still
looked
the
part
the
smell
was
of
wheaty
malts
and
rasberry
as
was
the
taste
nothing
exceptional
but
merely
what
the
name
delivers
decent
but
not
something
i
would
likely
spend
a
night
with
a
bit
odd
in
appearence
def
hazy
though
so
they
got
that
right
lightly
wheaty
in
the
aroma
and
sure
theres
the
little
fruity
notes
taste
wise
lightly
wheaty
and
lightly
fruity
go
figure
balanced
yes
just
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
refreshing
as
all
hell
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
finishing
with
a
well
carbonated
tingly
bite
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
did
i
even
get
the
right
draft
sent
to
me
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
raspberry
flavored
brew
until
reading
this
site
it
makes
sense
with
the
name
which
i
really
like
but
nothing
reminded
me
of
similar
beers
of
the
style
definitely
disappointed
a
bit
hoppy
on
the
tongue
paid
3
50
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
atlanta
give
it
a
shot
i
admit
to
not
being
a
fan
of
nonlambic
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
slightly
better
than
most
ive
tried
received
as
a
part
of
the
confederate
bif
from
biglove
this
beer
came
is
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
with
a
psychedelic
label
the
beer
looked
cloudy
and
fizzy
the
head
was
foamy
and
left
some
average
lace
the
aroma
did
not
emphasize
fruit
but
instead
this
smelled
more
like
a
yeasty
wheat
ale
with
some
sour
mash
the
taste
was
light
with
raspberry
flavor
coming
through
in
a
very
subtle
way
unfortunately
the
malt
base
backing
the
fruit
was
very
bland
and
flavorless
which
was
all
the
more
surprising
since
the
body
was
not
too
thin
hardly
any
hop
presence
i
had
seen
this
beer
for
a
while
on
the
shelves
and
had
been
avoiding
it
since
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
this
one
is
not
awful
but
it
wont
change
my
opinion
about
the
style
i
will
stick
to
the
abita
amber
which
i
think
is
quite
nice
overall
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
beer
the
promise
of
a
wheat
beer
combined
with
raspberries
made
me
look
forward
to
trying
it
and
the
appearance
certainly
hinted
at
that
the
taste
fell
a
little
short
it
had
a
nice
raspberry
flavor
to
it
but
was
lacking
in
wheatbeer
character
the
taste
was
quite
weak
there
was
a
slight
raspberry
front
that
fades
in
and
out
through
out
the
beers
trip
across
the
tongue
a
nutty
hop
finish
hits
strongly
at
the
end
and
a
sleight
hop
taste
is
present
throughout
although
very
effervescent
the
beer
is
on
the
thin
side
all
in
all
a
rather
hum
drum
experience
drinkability

this
wasnt
really
that
bad
of
a
drinker
it
delivered
on
what
it
promised
thats
for
sure
caramel
color
and
poured
up
very
cloudy
with
lots
of
sedement
big
frothy
head
faded
fast
bland
aroma
that
doesnt
really
go
with
flavor
malty
taste
quickly
gives
away
to
rasberry
flavor
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
was
more
intrigued
by
the
name
perhaps
it
would
be
better
with
jimmy
probably
wouldnt
recomend
it
after
reading
some
positive
reviews
by
others
im
wondering
if
i
just
drank
a
skunked
beer
maybe
ill
pick
up
a
fresh
bottle
and
give
it
one
more
try
12
ouncer
has
a
hard
to
comprehend
consume
before
date
notched
onto
the
label
better
then
nothing
but
not
much
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
cantaloupe
melon
color
moderate
carbonation
and
body
nose
is
subtle
fruityness
this
is
litely
flavored
wheat
like
concotion
soft
malty
up
front
notes
of
fruit
sweet
berries
flowery
slight
hop
bite
in
the
finish
light
fruity
sweet
and
refreshing
worth
a
try
if
you
like
em
on
the
light
mild
fruity
and
sweet
side
good
for
light
fare
and
dessert
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
not
especially
exciting
but
im
sure
it
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
good
for
a
raspberry
wheat
but
nothing
to
kiss
the
sky
about
the
foamy
lace
was
thin
and
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
orangered
color
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
this
brew
at
all
drinkability
nope
stay
away
its
unlikely
we
got
two
bad
batches
over
a
year
apart
my
number
two
worst
beer
i
dont
think
it
will
be
suplanted
any
time
soon
comments
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
drinkers
of
heavy
complex
belgian
beers
will
probably
want
to
look
elsewhere
many
folks
seem
to
be
unimpressed
with
abita
but
i
would
suggest
that
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
showing
sampled
on
draft
flying
saucer
ft
worth
tx
a
hazy
orange
beer
with
a
minimal
white
head
raspberry
and
floral
aroma
raspberries
dominate
the
flavor
to
the
exclusion
of
practically
all
other
ingredients
smooth
and
easydrinking
the
cool
name
outshines
the
quality
of
the
beer
overall
impression
4
easy
drinking
thirst
quencher
ive
fond
memories
of
many
many
many
mugs
of
hazy
on
bourbon
street
watching
the
timeless
exchange
of
beads
for
pleasure
its
hard
to
be
impartial
still
while
this
isnt
a
ba
kind
of
beer
it
is
a
nicely
done
fruit
lawnmower
the
value
of
which
should
not
be
undervalued
until
you
feel
the
sauna
that
is
the
gulf
coast
in
august
an
inch
and
a
half
of
white
fizziness
sits
on
the
hazy
orangegold
blushing
beer
there
are
peanuts
of
course
and
overripe
raspberries
in
the
nose
raspberries
abound
in
the
dry
but
not
tart
front
the
middle
is
thinnish
fizzytingly
and
sweetish
with
raspberries
finish
is
again
mostly
berries
but
also
grainsy
and
a
little
bitter
its
not
bad
the
raspberries
are
a
nice
offset
to
the
abita
peanuts
weak
bodied
and
overbubbled
there
is
very
little
to
this
beer
and
even
less
thats
enjoyable
purple
haze
such
a
cool
song
such
a
cool
name
and
such
an
uninspired
beer
abita
owes
it
to
themselves
and
to
us
to
brew
a
kickass
raspberry
wheat
that
bears
this
name
im
waiting
pours
a
twofingered
white

reddishamber
color

with

a
12
oz
bottle
from
liquor
barn
london
ky
not
even
a
summer
refresher
or
a
lawn
mower
beer
i
doubt
ill
have
it
again
pours
out
a
hazy
copper
color
a
small
head
appeared
and
quickly
disappeared
leaving
only
a
tiny
ring
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
smells
quite
interesting
i
definitely
detect
the
smells
of
a
typical
wheat
beer
mostly
bananas
but
can
also
detect
the
underlying
fruit
im
not
sure
that
id
be
able
to
pin
it
on
raspberry
if
the
bottle
didnt
tell
me
thats
what
it
was
but
it
does
smell
fruity
at
least
taste
is
fair
to
middling
faint
wheat
taste
with
faint
raspberry
and
some
twang
finishes
sort
of
bland
mouthfeel
is
thin
not
overly
carbonated
but
still
doesnt
really
have
much
body
this
is
fairly
drinkable
no
better
than
an
average
craft
beer
but
certainly
much
better
than
a
macro
nothing
id
recommend
to
anyone
seeking
a
new
wheat
beer
though
an
interesting
brew
very
light
delicate
and
wellbalanced
a
difficult
beer
to
pull
off
correctlybut
i
need
a
little
more
oooomph
in
my
brew
about
as
good
as
you
can
get
when
it
comes
to
crossover
brews
ok
sue
me
for
being
a
pig
but
this
brew
is
for
sissies
and
i
mean
that
with
the
utmost
respect
overall
a
dissapointing
beer
abitas
purple
haze
is
a
raspberry
flavored
beer
that
is
fairly
easy
to
find
in
lousiana
and
texas
purple
haze
pours
a
fittingly
hazy
dark
peach
color
with
a
pretty
large
head
smell
is
fairly
standard
with
a
sweet
fruity
finish
taste
is
really
smooth
with
notible
raspberry
finish
overall
purple
haze
is
a
very
drinkable
fruitflavored
brew
but
it
isnt
something
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
a
single
session
i
see
purple
haze
as
a
quality
novelty
brew
and
wellworth
a
try
for
beer
enthusiasts
a
sweet
linger
for
such
a
dry
product
on
tap
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
peach
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
fruity
with
hints
of
wheat
and
yeast
not
a
very
strong
aroma
though
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
at
first
and
is
then
overran
with
diacetyl
its
like
they
tried
to
make
a
butter
flavored
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
only
fair
and
the
drinkability
lacked
some
due
to
the
horrible
diacetyl
taste
impressions
interesting
but
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
seems
to
not
get
better
as
the
glass
is
less
full
not
terrible
but
not
impressive
either
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
very
light
and
watery
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
dull
orange
typically
cloudy
wheat
color
you
can
really
taste
the
raspberries
at
the
end
tastes
like
they
flavor
this
after
and
not
during
the
brewing
process
a
shallow
wheat
beer
with
no
standout
characteristic
other
than
the
raspberries
and
too
watery
for
my
taste
this
might
make
a
fair
summer
beer
depending
on
your
taste
goes
down
easy
but
so
does
a
cool
glass
of
water
pours
a
hazy
orangehoney
color
nothing
purple
about
it
low
offwhite
sinking
head
low
aroma
of
sweet
fruit
a
little
grapey
but
no
malt
or
hops
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
tingly
too
much
like
soda
flavor
is
juicy
pretty
empty
upfront
and
all
in
the
finish
where
the
raspberry
finally
makes
itself
known
the
raspberry
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
flavor
also
has
no
malt
or
hops
this
one
has
no
depth
and
is
out
of
balance
drinkability
if
my
next
bottle
was
free
id
probably
pass
on
the
offer
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
orangegold
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
practically
no
head
there
was
a
very
fine
film
that
formed
the
aroma
was
merely
average
as
well
with
just
a
hint
of
raspberry
and
malts
the
taste
was
fairly
wheatfilled
in
the
beginning
before
giving
way
to
a
slight
raspberry
flavor
with
some
other
fruit
tones
lingering
in
the
background
overall
the
drinkability
is
moderate
at
best
and
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
very
pale
yellow
brown
color
after
the
pour
you
see
alot
of
big
bubbled
carbination
the
head
went
into
nothingness
you
do
not
see
alot
of
carbination
while
it
is
sitting
in
the
glass
i
catch
mainly
a
citrus
smell
and
flavor
but
nothing
really
presents
itself
as
overpowering
heavy
water
taste
with
alot
of
carbination
hitting
your
tongue
slight
champagne
memorybut
maybe
one
that
was
hit
with
seltzer
very
light
taste
and
feel
good
for
warm
days
or
warm
bars
beer
gardens
smooth
but
nothing
that
jumps
at
you
with
a
main
flavor
the
raspberry
seems
like
an
afterthought
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
the
beer
itself
does
not
have
anything
to
compete
nope
its
not
really
purple
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
maybe
a
hint
of
a
pinkish
color
small
white
head
disappeared
quickly
smell
was
pretty
nice
mainly
raspberries
with
a
little
wheat
very
light
malt
flavor
with
raspberries
noticeable
but
not
as
prominent
as
in
the
smell
watery
mouthfeel
fizzy
carbonation
not
bad
just
not
exciting
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
offered
to
me
beer
is
good
happy
beering
great
aroma
smells
like
fresh
raspberries
with
a
skunky
hop
aroma
underneath
light
tan
colored
head
fades
fast
to
a
film
hazy
light
golden
colored
beer
clean
light
and
refreshing
beer
crisp
raspberry
flavor
sits
atop
a
light
wheat
base
theres
really
not
much
to
the
beer
and
the
finish
is
clean
its
toward
the
lighter
end
of
the
fruit
wheat
beer
spectrum
but
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
pours
a
hazed
orange
color
with
barely
any
head
at
all
the
smell
is
that
of
a
light
hint
of
tart
fruit
and
light
burnt
grassy
notesodd
the
taste
is
of
light
malts
faint
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
fruit
and
a
sharp
carb
bite
this
is
a
very
very
light
bodied
beer
that
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
kind
of
strange
but
i
was
expecting
it
after
having
other
beers
from
this
brewery
this
strange
brew
is
middle
of
the
road
to
me
cheers
i
did
happen
to
like
this
beer
better
than
petes
wicked
winter
brew
another
raspberry
wheat
the
flavors
in
this
beer
were
not
bad
but
it
just
wasnt
terribly
interesting
this
might
be
good
as
a
hot
weather
brew
drinking
this
was
an
underwhelming
experience
i
doubt
jimi
would
drink
this
beer
if
he
were
around
today
very
drinkable
about
the
same
as
iced
tea
appearance
was
just
average
imo
hazy
orange
with
virtually
no
head
and
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
smell
was
also
just
average
barely
a
hint
of
the
raspberry
flavor
inside
the
taste
was
where
this
beer
shined
though
and
i
guess
thats
a
good
thing
considering
its
really
the
most
important
thing
to
consider
it
had
a
crisp
wheat
flavor
with
raspberries
and
other
fruit
undertones
the
raspberry
was
not
artificial
tasting
at
all
very
nice
mouthfeel
was
good
reminded
me
of
a
wit
very
crisp
drinkability
was
good
as
well
went
down
very
smooth
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
give
it
a
try
of
you
like
fruit
beers
nothing
purple
about
this
one
in
all
fairness
to
the
brewery
i
will
assume
my
bottle
was
several
months
past
the
freshness
date
but
dont
know
this
for
certain
if
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
i
dont
know
how
they
could
sell
much
of
this
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pinkish
gold
color
with
a
spotty
lace
head
its
not
a
very
good
looking
beer
thats
for
sure
the
aroma
is
weak
but
smelling
of
raspberries
and
pale
wheat
malts
they
could
use
to
increase
the
raspberries
used
in
the
brewing
of
this
one
for
one
it
would
increase
the
purple
color
and
the
aroma
of
the
fruit
i
had
to
stick
my
nose
practically
in
the
beer
to
get
a
wiff
also
the
flavor
would
be
more
pronounced
brewers
always
pussy
out
on
the
use
of
fruit
anyways
the
taste
is
average
it
is
quite
watery
with
a
slight
raspberry
aftertaste
that
hangs
on
your
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
drinks
fair
i
liked
this
beer
until
i
looked
at
it
critically
yellowpeach
in
color
with
chill
haze
and
aggressive
bubbly
carbonation
small
and
shortlived
white
head
at
the
forefront
the
aroma
is
the
citruslike
tang
of
a
wheat
bear
faint
berry
aroma
is
there
as
well
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
the
smellits
sort
of
underdone
and
artificial
taste
is
essentially
that
of
a
substandard
wheat
beer
with
a
little
raspberry
watery
thin
and
overly
carbonated
this
beer
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
and
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
it
when
i
can
find
it
have
bought
this
for
my
wife
many
times
as
she
came
to
like
awhile
backpours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
light
puple
tint
to
it
usually
not
much
head
pretty
flat
lookin
aroma
has
a
graininess
to
it
with
an
artifical
raspberry
tinge
to
it
taste
is
up
and
down
has
some
decent
raspberry
flavors
to
it
with
a
light
wheaty
malt
flavor
vut
it
really
sputters
out
about
half
way
down
the
glass
after
one
bottle
i
normally
cant
drink
anymore
its
cloyingthe
sweetness
really
comes
up
fast
on
ya
for
girls
at
least
thats
all
i
see
drink
it
ill
steer
another
direction
it
is
sticky
in
the
mouth
but
carbonated
i
have
seen
people
order
a
pitcher
of
purple
haze
and
come
back
for
more
i
guess
it
is
an
aquired
taste
for
me
one
was
plenty
for
a
lifetime
notes
two
middle
fingers
up
would
only
redrink
this
under
threat
of
force
12
oz
twistoff
with
freshness
date
notched
on
the
back
label
its
not
purple
but
there
are
tints
of
it
the
raspberry
aroma
is
quite
potent
but
the
raspberry
is
a
more
subtle
with
the
flavor
its
there
but
not
overpowering
its
pretty
crisp
like
youd
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
i
think
its
a
solid
effort
but
certainly
not
extraordinary
this
beer
just
screamed
coolness
to
me
named
after
a
hendrix
song
and
a
cool
purple
label
big
let
down
first
it
poured
a
bland
yellow
color
i
wasnt
really
expecting
it
to
be
purple
but
the
name
fooled
me
into
thinking
it
would
be
nonboring
had
a
medium
quickly
dissipating
head
and
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
grainy
and
there
were
a
few
fruits
but
mostly
just
the
normal
massproduct
smell
the
flavor
was
boring
as
well
a
little
malty
with
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
fruit
in
the
flavor
but
not
enough
to
even
mention
big
disappointment
hey
i
like
jimi
hendrix
and
heres
a
beer
named
after
him
maybe
ill
like
the
beer
too
pours
hmm
not
much
to
look
at
clear
gold
in
color
with
an
uneven
head
that
reminds
one
of
what
jimis
fro
would
have
looked
like
if
hed
stuck
around
long
enough
for
a
splotchy
baldness
starting
setting
in
how
bout
a
sniff
ugh
well
lets
see
hippies
smelled
bad
so
maybe
theyre
trying
to
make
some
sort
of
a
statement
here
i
would
have
preferred
patchouli
oil
however
to
the
rather
skunky
blend
of
raspberry
and
tart
wheat
that
i
found
here
im
not
looking
forward
to
the
taste
but
surprise
its
actually
not
horrible
the
raspberry
works
well
and
the
malt
actually
lends
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
undertone
to
the
beer
still
however
the
flavor
is
a
bit
onedimensional
and
the
hops
are
quite
muted
in
the
finish
more
like
the
many
cheap
imitators
that
would
follow
hendrix
than
the
original
deal
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
what
i
expected
at
all
very
malty
and
easy
drinking
with
a
touch
of
raspberry
fizzy
dull
dark
yellow
not
quite
the
shine
to
be
golden
small
white
tight
head
faded
fast
mixed
smell
of
fruit
punch
faint
raspberries
and
grains
sweet
syrupy
taste
breaks
through
then
fades
some
more
raspberry
flavors
settles
in
flat
light
carbonation
and
prickly
sweetness
not
very
refreshing
overly
slick
sampled
2x
while
in
birmingham
maybe
there
is
a
bad
batch
out
there
but
this
one
was
a
dissapointment
started
out
with
a
good
looking
head
that
reduced
to
almost
nothing
has
an
appealing
color
with
a
thin
white
headvery
cloudy
with
tons
of
junk
floating
around
i
hope
its
wheat
and
not
dead
yeast
very
pungent
raspberry
nose
thats
very
tart
smelling
color
is
a
straw
yellow
foaming
mouthfeel
that
leaves
a
full
feeling
in
the
stomach
no
traces
of
lacing
left
the
raspberry
flavor
isnt
that
good
the
aroma
of
raspberry
makes
the
taste
a
big
let
down
crisply
carbonated
thats
easy
to
swallow
its
ok
in
my
opinion
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
nor
would
i
reccomend
it
maybe
real
raspberries
instead
of
raspberry
flavoring
would
make
it
better
i
seriously
think
i
could
have
thrown
some
rasberry
extract
in
a
glass
of
pbr
and
gotten
the
same
results
the
wheat
mentioned
on
the
label
is
barely
detectable
much
less
delectable
hahahaha
ugh
where
am
i
going
with
this
oh
yeah
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
fruity
id
eat
a
banana
dangit
i
was
really
disappointed
with
purple
haze
but
maybe
i
expected
too
much
its
a
cheap
beer
with
a
very
slight
rasberry
taste
nothing
more
perhaps
a
little
less
purple
haze
poured
a
cidery
brown
color
clouded
with
unappetizing
chunks
of
sediment
and
a
weak
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
light
a
tiny
bit
of
raspberry
and
banana
the
taste
is
also
very
light
nice
and
fruity
without
being
too
much
so
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
not
extraordinary
for
a
raspwheat
but
not
bad
either
this
is
a
murky
amber
brew
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
dissipated
much
too
quickly
leaving
only
small
hunks
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
definitely
impressed
with
a
raspberry
presence
and
this
carries
through
into
the
taste
a
fruity
presence
that
overlayed
the
wheat
base
this
is
an
ejoyable
beer
that
fruit
beer
drinkers
will
enjoy
in
the
good
old
summertime
pours
a
light
and
murky
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
decent
lacing
aroma
is
raspberries
of
course
but
really
nothing
else
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
i
was
building
a
deck
in
almost
90
degree
temperatures
but
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
easy
to
drink
light
bodied
and
very
crisp
and
fortunately
the
raspberry
flavor
is
not
as
overwhelming
as
it
is
in
other
beers
of
this
type
clean
finish
nothing
awardwinning
in
my
book
but
a
passable
summer
beer
that
does
the
trick
sometimes
though
and
im
sure
this
would
be
quite
a
hit
with
the
ladies
at
the
beach
this
purple
haze
pours
a
nice
light
golden
yellow
a
fat
head
gave
away
to
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
raspberries
nothing
else
the
aroma
is
not
overpowering
like
most
fruit
beers
the
taste
is
a
touch
of
wheat
with
the
raspberries
and
a
bitter
finish
with
hops
the
raspberry
flavor
washed
away
to
nothing
after
the
swallow
it
started
out
nice
but
ended
up
watery
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
fruit
in
the
taste
the
watery
finish
doesnt
make
me
want
to
drink
more
so
it
is
low
in
drinkability
overall
not
bad
average
or
a
bit
above
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
peachy
in
color
that
was
fairly
cloudy
it
produced
a
minimal
head
that
lasted
a
whole
two
seconds
then
formed
a
slight
skim
and
ring
along
the
surface
very
little
lace
to
none
was
found
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
fairly
light
noses
of
tart
fresh
raspberries
wheat
grain
bread
and
a
slight
malt
at
the
end
the
taste
was
also
fairly
light
and
simple
flavors
of
light
raspberries
wheat
grains
bread
and
bitter
hops
all
were
present
the
over
all
feeling
of
this
beer
was
it
was
watery
and
the
flavors
were
overly
diluted
i
liked
the
raspberries
and
wheat
combination
just
wish
that
they
were
combined
better
to
give
a
crispier
feel
to
it
drinkable
but
there
are
better
fruit
beers
out
there
to
try
first
color
is
cloudy
pale
yellow
white
fizzy
head
faded
fast
leaving
a
skim
of
whisper
light
white
haze
on
top
that
stuck
around
the
whole
glass
and
had
some
very
small
spotty
lace
smell
is
mostly
wheat
pretty
sharp
with
a
very
slight
note
of
raspberry
taste
completely
mirrors
the
smell
with
lots
of
malted
wheat
a
tad
breadish
with
a
ever
so
slight
presense
of
raspberry
has
a
zesty
sweet
sharpness
thats
dulled
a
bit
at
the
start
and
then
airs
out
with
a
mellow
smoothness
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
a
bit
zesty
and
grainy
not
bad
drinkable
ya
sure
but
wheres
the
raspberry
orange
in
color
on
the
pour
with
littletono
head
what
does
show
up
is
gone
quickly
i
expected
better
the
smell
is
alright
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
raspberries
the
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
fading
to
a
light
hint
of
raspberry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
all
over
the
place
finishing
up
with
a
tingle
of
raspberry
at
the
back
of
my
mouth
drinkable
but
im
slightly
disappointed
thanks
to
morris729
for
the
bottle
indeed
they
dont
as
this
isnt
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
pinkish
hue
aroma
is
of
tart
raspberries
and
yeast
raspberry
flavor
is
pretty
mild
which
is
goodit
doesnt
overpower
the
other
flavors
however
there
arent
many
other
flavors
wheat
flavor
is
present
but
the
aftertaste
has
a
nasty
malty
macro
thing
going
on
that
isnt
too
great
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
for
a
fruit
or
wheat
beer
theres
much
better
out
there
very
little
raspberry
taste
more
wheat
tasting
than
anything
i
dont
really
care
for
fruit
beers
fer
fruits
only
i
guess
goldenyellow
hue
sticky
small
white
head
nose
of
light
rapberry
sweetness
in
the
backdrop
dry
palate
acidic
finish
this
is
nothing
i
will
seek
out
f
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
tinges
of
lemon
yellow
at
the
fringes
and
an
interesting
suspension
of
sediment
a
substantial
head
upon
pouring
though
it
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
underwhelming
with
just
a
mostly
clean
grain
smell
and
the
slightest
hint
of
fruit
very
watery
mouthfeel
with
a
taste
that
is
grainy
and
weak
much
like
the
nose
sweet
at
the
start
turning
crisp
and
then
getting
very
smooth
not
unpleasant
but
neither
strong
nor
memorable
this
one
is
certainly
drinkable
but
only
because
it
is
very
smooth
not
a
great
beer
but
an
ok
beverage
mouthfeel
also
like
raspberry
sodawater
very
thin
bodied
tight
carbonation
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
it
has
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
that
would
make
it
an
exceptional
summer
brew
the
fact
that
it
is
3
degrees
outside
and
we
are
due
for
12
20
inches
of
snow
is
not
hurting
it
though
lots
of
raspberries
hit
the
tongue
and
you
are
then
presented
with
a
nice
wheat
flavor
that
really
balances
it
out
this
is
a
pretty
good
fruity
brew
that
could
give
you
a
little
variety
from
time
to
time
pours
yellow
slightly
cloudy
no
aroma
to
speak
of
thin
head
that
does
not
last
no
lace
thin
berry
taste
more
malt
than
fruit
very
little
hop
finish
tinny
aftertaste
not
very
good
one
was
enough
medium
gold
color
slightly
pinkish
and
slightly
cloudy
small
to
no
head
aroma
is
raspberry
at
the
start
but
fades
to
a
little
maltyness
a
fairly
typical
and
very
average
fruit
wheat
beer
berry
flavor
is
mild
and
pretty
subdued
it
is
also
a
little
too
sweet
so
it
just
as
well
the
flavor
is
mild
pretty
average
mouthfeel
is
neutral
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
not
a
bad
little
bayou
beer
had
a
frothy
head
to
it
and
orangeyellowish
color
to
it
i
like
dixie
beer
so
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
shot
wasnt
disappointed
i
was
happy
with
my
six
of
it
and
couldnt
keep
my
buds
from
stealing
it
now
i
have
to
go
get
another
six
this
time
im
gonna
hide
it
anyways
it
went
down
smooth
and
had
a
semidry
finish
to
it
you
can
definately
smell
the
raspberry
in
it
but
the
fruity
taste
is
a
little
more
faint
give
it
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed
yall
it
aint
purple
but
it
sure
is
hazy
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
no
head
and
lace
slight
grain
and
big
raspberry
aroma
crisp
grainy
tastes
followed
by
tart
raspberries
sort
of
artificial
finishes
crisp
and
grainy
i
can
see
where
this
would
be
mighty
refreshing
in
the
middle
of
a
brutally
muggy
and
hot
louisiana
summer
but
for
a
beer
to
enjoy
and
savor
its
bad
too
much
like
a
malternative
i
like
the
good
mix
of
raspberry
and
wheat
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
notes
of
raspberry
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
tart
raspberry
flavors
and
a
dry
finish
a
nice
fruit
beer
hazy
gold
appearance
with
a
slight
rasberry
aroma
very
thin
in
body
with
a
dry
finish
i
really
thought
this
beer
was
horrible
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
certainly
would
not
pay
money
again
for
this
dry
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
decent
creamy
white
head
that
sinks
a
little
too
quickly
the
nose
has
some
slight
yeast
qualities
to
it
but
is
mostly
a
sweet
raspberry
aroma
decent
crisp
wheat
tastes
start
off
this
brew
before
it
goes
to
a
sticky
syrupy
raspberry
taste
that
is
too
overpowering
the
brew
is
a
bit
thin
for
being
unfiltered
but
is
fairly
refreshing
and
fairly
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
again
if
offered
from
someone
else
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
it
again
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
is
too
much
sweet
raspberry
and
not
enough
wheat
beer
this
beer
was
an
almost
pinkish
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
hold
and
left
little
lace
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
grain
and
raspberry
the
flavor
was
lightly
of
raspberry
and
a
bit
tart
the
finish
was
light
with
a
bit
of
the
tartness
a
fairly
weak
beer
for
this
style
but
okay
for
a
summer
session
brew
i
suppose
you
may
remember
the
good
times
from
nawlins
but
thats
about
all
this
beer
has
going
for
it
i
really
dont
understand
its
popularity
not
much
aroma
but
it
has
a
nice
malt
base
a
slight
raspberry
flavor
the
fruit
also
gives
it
a
gentle
tartness
which
works
pretty
well
but
overall
it
seems
kind
of
flabby
not
out
of
balance
in
any
way
just
unexceptional
in
character
one
more
thing
i
need
to
dispel
the
myth
that
this
is
a
womans
beer
its
a
fact
guys
a
sad
and
sorry
fact
that
more
men
drink
this
than
women
cloudy
orange
brown
color
with
lots
of
suspended
sediment
quite
large
rocky
head
when
poured
settles
to
a
thin
layer
with
moderate
lace
the
raspberries
are
quite
prominent
in
the
aroma
also
has
the
distinct
grain
notes
of
wheat
beer
flavor
is
quite
crisp
and
tart
begins
with
malt
flavor
then
tart
raspberries
with
slight
hops
towards
the
finish
very
refreshing
a
good
choice
for
summer
in
the
warmer
climes
notes
simple
and
pleasant
no
cloying
sweetness
or
artificial
fruit
flavour
a
great
pick
out
of
the
numerous
american
brewed
fruit
beers
take
abita
amber
and
give
it
just
enough
raspberry
flavor
to
be
noticeable
and
youve
got
purple
haze
kind
of
odd
actually
amber
is
preferable
passed
on
this
beer
a
number
of
times
because
the
name
sounded
too
much
like
one
of
those
cursed
malternative
beverages
according
to
the
label
raspberry
puree
is
added
after
filtering
so
im
not
sure
if
the
raspberry
is
a
brewing
element
or
a
flavoring
adjunct
lots
of
yeasty
sediment
which
decanted
in
spite
of
a
careful
pour
fruit
flavored
brew
johnoct
19
light
bodied
crisp
moderate
carbonation
easy
to
drink
fruity
a
great
spring
or
summer
beer
you
could
drink
every
day
i
dont
like
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
its
a
decent
enough
beer
the
apricot
flavor
doesnt
taste
contrived
and
the
residual
sweetness
is
more
apparent
than
real
i
could
see
this
as
a
refreshing
hot
weather
beer
this
is
an
overly
sweet
fruitvegetable
beer
that
is
just
too
much
for
me
its
only
suitable
for
drinking
very
sparsely
i
didnt
really
like
it
but
a
lot
of
people
do
almost
like
a
dry
apricot
cider
nose
is
sweet
taste
is
less
so
but
still
very
fruity
not
a
subtle
apricot
it
is
very
much
there
if
you
like
apricot
and
lighter
beers
you
will
love
this
nice
apricot
smell
and
taste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
horrible
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
backend
great
beer
for
a
summer
day
by
the
pool
easy
to
drink
with
a
light
apricot
taste
and
a
smooth
finish
very
fruity
the
apricot
flavor
is
a
bit
overwhelming
not
terrible
overall
though
a
bit
hinting
of
banana
and
belgiany
yeast
flavors
this
was
my
first
fruit
beer
and
it
has
remained
delicious
all
these
years

so

overall
not
a
bad
beer
jut
not
anything
to
go
bonkers
about

not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of

this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
looks
like
beer
who
am
i
to
say
otherwise
o
i
think
it
is
a
good
fruit
beer
it
tastes
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
that
being
said
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
gravitate
towards
however
i
have
learned
that
having
a
beer
party
where
there
will
be
several
people
who
are
not
beer
drinkers
or
women
that
are
not
really
beer
drinkers
fruit
beers
are
a
must
i
would
have
this
one
on
hand
then
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
smell
is
pretty
much
all
apricot
as
expected
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
fruity
taste
no
bitterness
or
hop
presence
detectable
fair
carbonation
crispy
after
taste
its
a
little
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
not
bad
for
a
fruit
style
beer
overall
worth
it
please
enjoy
one
and
think
for
yourself
for
some
it
might
get
too
peachy
after
a
while
it
also
might
be
a
little
too
carbonated
for
some
it
feels
a
little
like
mountain
dew
at
times
its
really
purely
subjective
if
either
is
too
much
or
just
right
for
you
on
tap
in
omaha
ne
frosted
mug
hazy
amber
orange
appearance
head
stayed
for
a
little
while
smelled
like
apricots
and
sweet
malt
maybe
a
touch
of
seltzer
went
down
exceptionally
smooth
mouthfeel
was
buttery
and
smooth
ended
refreshing
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
and
sweetness
almost
everything
was
right
here
definite
apricot
reminds
me
of
apricot
candy
without
being
artificial
or
nonbeer
like
great
beer
on
tap
o
this
is
an
outstanding
apricot
having
had
several
i
think
this
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
this
beer
was
decent
for
what
it
is
i
almost
feel
like
im
drinking
a
wine
cooler
as
they
have
removed
any
characteristics
of
an
beer
from
this
you
can
taste
beer
but
i
would
liken
it
to
the
most
ultralight
beer
you
ever
had
not
bad
drink
but
i
expected
a
beer
12oz
bottle
with
no
discernible
freshness
date
sort
of
hazy
yellow
lots
of
lacing
but
a
filmy
head
aroma
is
mild
apricots
and
wheat
flavor
is
wheat
and
mold
apricots
easy
to
drink
but
really
falls
short
in
comparison
to
dry
docks
apricot
ale
id
take
that
beer
over
this
one
every
day
of
the
week
o
pretty
refreshing
brew
the
apricot
can
seem
a
little
too
sweet
and
artificial
at
times
but
still
quite
drinkable
pyramid
apricot
ale
3
55
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
in
color
and
really
doesnt
head
a
head
at
all
some
very
light
spotty
lacing
was
seen
but
not
much
perfect
carbonation
when
first
opened
the
aroma
of
fresh
apricots
hits
your
nose
right
up
front
with
some
wheat
very
nice
the
taste
was
even
better
with
just
the
right
sweetness
with
good
wheat
to
balance
out
the
flavor
no
bad
aftertaste
and
goes
down
very
easy
available
year
around
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
that
lingers
as
a
ring
around
the
tip
of
the
liquid
no
lacing
aroma
is
apricots
and
clean
american
wheat
ale
flavor
is
of
course
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
but
with
a
sharp
bite
of
wheat
to
balance
the
sweet
no
significant
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
juicy
overall
impression
see
above
o
meh
how
many
different
ways
can
you
say
chick
beer
overall
a
delicious
summer
beer
my
only
complaint
is
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
a
little
higher
overall
this
beer
works
if
you
like
apricots
beer
and
are
brave
enough
to
think
outside
the
box
that
the
two
together
might
actually
be
flavorful
i
say
well
done
pyramid
it
makes
me
want
to
try
your
other
offerings
tastes
like
apricot
chapstick
mouthfeel
is
weird
and
acerbic
hard
to
get
past
the
chapstick
though
cannot
recommend
to
any
but
the
most
diehard
apricot
fans
overall
this
is
a
brew
big
on
apricot
flavor
with
much
less
of
else
taking
away
from
its
center
stage
presence
rather
tasty
and
refreshing
and
a
good
go
to
if
you
feel
like
something
apricot
or
fruity
not
bad
overall
was
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
beers
that
i
drink
the
apricot
aroma
was
nice
so
was
the
flavor
not
sure
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
or
consume
this
one
i
really
like
this
beer
it
does
taste
like
apricot
but
its
not
overly
sweet
i
like
that
isnt
a
hoppie
beer
for
me
i
dont
care
for
a
hoppie
beer
my
friends
and
i
have
had
this
beer
with
baked
cod
and
steamed
california
mix
veggies
we
have
also
drank
this
with
mexican
foods
for
me
it
cleansed
the
palate
well
with
foods
tonight
we
had
it
with
pecan
crusted
tilapia
and
asparagus
very
nice
with
both
o
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
because
the
apricot
flavors
seemed
natural
and
not
syrupy
or
artificial
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
one
again
i
think
most
people
seem
to
prefer
bitter
beers
so
they
rated
this
beer
down
i
cant
drink
real
bitter
beer
like
ipa
so
i
found
this
refreshing
this
is
a
solid
apricot
beer
no
complaints
its
not
too
fruity
either
pretty
balanced
with
a
mediumlight
body
some
reviewers
felt
the
aftertaste
wasnt
good
i
disagree
i
feel
the
aftertaste
was
fine
just
shows
that
taste
isnt
universal
great
for
a
springsummer
day
for
its
style
i
love
it
great
on
a
warm
yard
work
day
ive
had
it
on
draft
before
and
id
probably
a
cold
one
on
draft
will
get
a
half
a
point
boost
in
every
category
a
well
done
fruit
beer
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
see
this
as
a
good
fit
for
a
warm
summer
day
spent
outside
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
this
fruit
beer
and
i
usually
dont
like
fruit
beers
although
i
love
apricots
and
this
has
a
very
natural
apricot
flavor
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
average
wheat
beers
out
there
and
a
really
great
springsummer
refresher
nicely
done
ohonesty
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
but
enjoyed
it
i
would
try
again
on
tap
during
the
summer
blech
i
love
apricots
but
this
beer
is
far
from
it
the
aftertaste
is
very
near
the
point
of
being
downright
nasty
and
the
beer
really
has
no
redeeming
qualities
stay
away
from
this
one
overall
its
very
enjoyable
although
not
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
i
would
not
be
disappointed
if
i
bought
a
sixer
of
it
though
it
would
all
get
drank
nothing
special
here
just
a
decent
summer
beer
to
bring
to
a
bbq
i
can
see
noncraft
beer
drinkers
liking
this
so
i
guess
it
may
be
a
good
gateway
beer
pyramid
makes
a
good
hefeweizen
i
would
recommend
picking
that
up
pours
a
cloudy
lifeless
orangeish
color
looks
like
fruit
juice
a
few
shades
darker
than
orange
juice
zero
head
present
nose
is
full
of
citrus
orange
zest
and
apricot
very
fruity
with
absence
of
any
malt
profile
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
heavy
candied
apricot
character
not
much
else
going
on
than
carbonated
orange
and
apricot
juice
this
borders
on
malternative
territory
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
well
carbonated
overall
the
flavor
isnt
bad
per
se
but
it
certainly
isnt
good
for
a
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
too
much
so
the
high
sugar
levels
make
the
liquid
thicker
the
carbonation
cannot
overcome
the
cloyingly
sweet
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
like
peach
cobbler
not
my
style
overall
not
very
good
but
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
lots
of
fruit
but
its
all
fairly
syrupy
fake
tasting
light
carb
doesnt
help
and
sticky
sweet
kinda
icky
feel
brings
the
bad
beer
back
to
where
i
expected
it
to
be
poured
this
fruit
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
hazy
orangish
color
produced
a
decent
off
white
head
below
average
retention
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
ale
was
full
of
fruity
apricot
and
peach
light
in
body
this
beer
had
a
base
of
malted
grain
sweet
apricot
and
peach
nectar
there
is
a
somewhat
of
a
sour
medicinal
taste
that
is
not
well
balanced
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
quite
appealing
packs
a
very
nice
punch
but
the
apricot
flavor
does
not
follow
the
lead
thin
watery
this
beer
could
be
much
improved
with
a
bit
more
body
and
apricot
flavor
that
matches
the
aroma
pours
a
clear
gold
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
strong
apricot
slight
pale
malt
slight
wheat
and
a
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
fruit
vegetable
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
apricot
slight
wheat
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
decent
body
and
blend
but
the
appearance
is
very
weak
o
i
go
back
and
forth
on
how
i
feel
about
this
one
clearly
its
no
aprihop
as
the
apricot
line
of
beers
go
and
the
smell
can
overwhelm
but
i
like
apricots
and
kind
of
like
drinking
this
o
this
was
pretty
bad
all
apricot
no
beer
is
there
a
demographic
that
will
drink
it
yes
definitely
so
it
will
probably
sell
fairly
well
the
wine
cooler
crowd
will
undoubtedly
eat
it
up
this
is
the
ultimate
bitch
beer
if
youll
pardon
the
expression
there
are
far
better
fruit
beers
on
the
market
this
one
just
left
me
feeling
gassy
and
bloated

it
was

and
grabbed
a
sixer
out
of

this

was
a

with
a

retention
and
some

the
apricot

is
bright
and
appealing
with
hints
of

buried
underneath
the
flavors
were
again
mostly
apricot

it
is
dry
which
is
the

character
especially
if
you

of

on

good

was
nice
and

followed
immediatly
by
a
blast
of
zesty
fruit
cup
flavor
the
apricot
is
apparent
but
there
are
also
some
tart
fermentation
byproduct
tastes
similiar
to
pear
and
peach
and
has
a
goldenorange
color
similar
to
that
of
an
apricot
the
creamy
white
head
holds
fairly
well
before
dropping
to
a
wide
collar
this
beer
gets
pluses
for
staying
true
to
what
it
was
trying
to
accomplish
i
think
the
appearence
could
use
some
help
though
overall
i
think
its
nicely
complex
for
being
a
simply
apricot
beer
really
only
for
apricot
lovers
because
there
really
isnt
much
else
here
poured
out
a

i
cant

tell

its

so

my

man
its
like
someone
jabbed
a
bunch
of
apricot
up
my
nose
lots
of
them
yeeesh
ok
what
the
fck
the
taste
is
like
apricot
syrup
i
am
not
against
fruit
beers
bring
it
on
but
its
fruit
beer
not
fruit
can
i
throw
up
now
this
is
like
drinking
the
syrup
out
of
a
shoprite
packaged
fruit
can
on
sale
and
expired
seriously
bad
stuff
les
just
get
on
with
our
lives
now
this
is
a
very
nice
fruit
beers
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
have
a
soda
type
mouthfeel
imo
but
this
one
is
great
the
apricots
really
come
out
very
well
this
is
a
beer
anyone
can
enjoy
the
apricot
smell
is
alluring
the
only
thing
not
so
great
about
this
beer
is
its
appearance
could
have
a
lot
more
head
and
retention
i
will
definetly
pick
this
up
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
apricot
fix
pours
a
two
finger

head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin

no

and
medium
bodied
strong
apricot
nose
starts
with
a
sweet
strong

this

would
be
much
better
in
the
summer
1
69
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
chalet
party
goshen
in
pyramid
apricot
weizen
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
was
small
and
soon
dissipated
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
all
apricots
the
taste
was
apricots
over
a
light
malt
and
wheat
base
it
was
not
overly
sweet
and
balanced
out
nicely
in
the
finish
it
was
mediumfull
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
dinkability
was
about
average
its
alright
for
something
different
but
one
is
enough
for
me
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
great
beer
like
blue
moon
for
nonbeer
drinkers
this
beer
to
me
seemed
very
poor
in
quality
and
did
not
have
anything
in
my
book
going
for
it
like
i
said
i
could
not
finish
it
due
to
its
sweetness
but
like
i
say
give
it
a
try
but
ill
tell
you
there
are
way
better
interpretations
of
this
style
d
drinkable
might
work
as
a
session
beer
in
the
hot
summer
i
dont
really
like
it
the
meld
of
apricot
and
wheat
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
weizens
in
general
if
i
were
this
might
be
more
palatable
valiant
attempt
here
pyramid
but
ill
stick
with
your
wonderful
thunderhead
could
be
good
drinking
on
a
summer
day
but
doesnt
pack
enough
flavor
for
much
else
drinkability
unimpressive
flavor
limits
ones
eagerness
to
consume
it
is
uninhibiting
and
not
very
filling
however
a
middling
beer
experience
hazed
dull
amber
thin
dirty
white
head
specks
of
co2
cling
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
aroma
is
apricot
and
more
apricot
it
doesnt
really
overload
the
senses
but
theres
not
a
lot
else
going
on
here
still
a
nice
aroma
i
think
juicy
apricot
plays
over
a
dulled
wheat
base
to
give
this
beer
a
little
character
spritzy
mouthfeel
and
refreshing
decent
enough
beer
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
imagine
overall
i
do
not
like
this
beer
i
only
have
it
because
my
mom
who
does
like
it
bought
some
and
left
it
at
my
house
i
guess
if
you
like
your
drinks
to
taste
like
apricot
you
might
like
it
dvery
easy
to
drink
its
the
beer
you
buy
forr
girls
when
your
at
the
bar
a
decent
offering
for
what
it
is
flavor
is
certainly
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
a
drinkable
brew
especially
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
worth
a
try
not
to
bad
as
long
as
you
like
apricots
very
one
dimensional
poured
into
a
pint
glass
little
head
and
cloudy
peachbronze
in
color
the
haziness
was
expected
being
an
unfiltered
weizen
beer
the
smell
was
not
too
intense
but
definitely
of
apricots
the
initial
taste
is
of
the
apricot
sweetness
followed
by
a
kiss
of
kiss
of
hops
that
balance
the
beer
nicely
as
far
as
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
a
sort
of
medium
creamy
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
my
first
apricot
beer
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
not
too
often
that
an
apricot
beer
comes
across
the
palate
and
its
good
for
a
change
from
the
usual
it
may
also
be
a
good
choice
for
those
that
dont
enjoy
the
banana
clove
etc
flavors
of
german
hefes
but
want
something
more
exciting
than
an
american
wheat
drinkability
this
is
more
akin
to
soda
than
an
ale
but
an
interesting
change
of
pace
for
the
warmer
months
or
for
those
who
have
a
hard
time
enjoying
beer
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
semithick
head
smelled
only
slightly
of
apricot
seemed
dry
with
a
little
hoppiness
much
lighter
than
i
expected
the
fruityweizen
taste
goes
down
well
would
be
good
on
a
summer
day
but
id
sooner
reach
for
a
9
i
have
not
had
this
beer
in
years
but
my
wife
saw
it
while
walking
through
trader
joes
and
i
figured
what
the
hell
and
picked
up
a
six
pack
ever
since
i
started
drinking
beer
and
even
during
my
period
of
not
liking
any
type
of
fruit
beer
i
have
always
found
this
beer
to
be
nice
quaffable
and
enjoyable
a
work
of
artistic
brewing
perhaps
not
but
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
well
chilled
in
the
fridge
when
it
is
110f
45c
out
like
the
other
reviews
before
me
im
not
into
fruity
beers
after
pouring
it
into
a
pint
glass
i
noticed
a
rust
orange
color
with
a
small
head
which
disapeared
in
about
a
minute
the
smell
is
of
a
powerful
apricot
odor
which
almost
turned
me
off
immediately
the
first
taste
was
smooth
with
a
distant
apricot
finish
a
lot
less
than
the
strong
smell
of
the
beer
the
beer
had
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
higher
drinability
than
most
other
fruity
beers
i
would
only
recommend
drinking
about
2
because
of
the
lingering
apricot
taste
it
will
leave
in
your
mouth
i
would
prefer
to
drink
an
american
hef
and
add
my
own
garnish
of
fruit
it
was
drinkable
i
guess
if
you
really
have
a
thing
for
apricots
in
particular
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
i
bought
a
sixpack
and
the
final
three
sat
in
my
fridge
for
a
month
until
i
was
out
of
everything
else
orange
in
color
maybe
a
little
amberish
decent
sized
white
head
bubbles
up
aroma
is
of
course
of
apricot
but
with
some
bready
wheat
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
sweet
and
tangy
apricot
but
not
an
obnoxious
amount
bready
wheat
helps
balance
and
subdue
it
simple
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
maybe
a
little
cloying
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
is
what
it
is
an
apricot
beer
i
dont
have
anything
against
them
it
was
awesome
on
a
96
degree
and
humid
day
pyramids
apricot
weizen
pours
a
deep
golden
hue
holding
it
up
to
a
light
i
noticed
it
is
slightly
cloudy
in
appearance
the
head
dissipated
quickly
but
tracings
clung
in
minute
amounts
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
very
subdued
apricot
scent
compared
to
my
expectations
with
a
touch
of
grass
the
flavor
of
the
beer
naturally
brought
to
mind
apricots
but
was
slightly
bitter
there
was
a
significant
aftertaste
considering
how
little
taste
appeared
while
drinking
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
unimpressive
this
beer
looks
and
felt
like
a
slightly
thicker
macro
not
bad
for
a
different
kind
of
beer
but
certainly
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
average
golden
color
fruity
aromadoesnt
scream
apricots
but
they
are
definately
there
definate
apricot
flavorfairly
fruity
nice
crisp
tang
to
the
finish
ok
body
a
decent
enough
beer
i
dont
find
any
real
weizen
characteristics
to
balance
the
fruitiness
more
then
1
or
2
would
be
too
sweet
for
me
worth
a
shot
a
good
fruit
beer
and
one
that
can
really
introduce
people
to
the
style
i
have
had
a
few
fruit
beers
and
this
one
is
not
bad
worth
a
try
if
someone
you
know
wants
to
drink
something
that
is
not
very
strong
worth
the
smell
alone
overall
it
lives
up
to
its
name
apricots
definitely
are
the
main
point
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
due
to
tiring
of
the
apricot
flavor
anyway
this
is
nice
beer
my
wife
liked
it
too
apricot
weizen
is
a
hazy
orange
with
a
small
ultrawhite
head
retention
is
weak
the
aroma
is
a
very
full
fresh
sweettart
apricot
with
a
bit
of
underlying
wheat
a
sip
begins
with
tart
apricot
which
quickly
sweetens
with
the
additional
of
malt
and
wheat
flavors
the
apricot
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
towards
midsip
when
its
flavor
peaks
the
yeasty
hefe
character
is
minimal
here
apricot
and
wheat
flavors
dominate
overall
apricot
weizen
is
a
nice
fruit
beer
perhaps
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
still
a
good
example
of
how
to
combine
beer
and
fruit
flavors
but
maybe
not
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
apricots
highly
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
id
wager
but
itd
have
to
be
pretty
hot
for
me
had
to
try
it
and
get
a
bottle
of
the
regular
apricot
too
my
fiance
loved
them
both
i
was
not
so
enthralled
this
orangish
concotion
was
better
than
the
regular
apricot
decent
head
on
this
one
but
it
only
throws
up
apricotpeachness
with
a
bit
of
bread
taste
is
smooth
not
as
cloy
as
the
other
one
the
aftertaste
lingers
still
too
sweet
and
not
a
more
than
one
a
sitting
beer
drinkability
easy
to
drink
for
a
summer
brew
from
a
pretty
hard
pour
a
small
white
head
forms
and
dissipates
just
as
quickly
as
it
came
a
nose
with
a
moderate
amount
of
ripe
apricot
and
not
alot
else
the
taste
is
slight
tang
sourness
with
a
mettalic
quality
in
the
middle
that
is
not
really
pleasing
not
much
happening
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
i
imagine
this
beer
can
be
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
what
taste
there
is
wasnt
really
pleasing
due
to
the
metallic
quality
i
really
like
this
beer
im
not
a
usual
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
done
right
even
and
balanced
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
damn
good
fruit
beer
not
over
the
top
like
so
many
in
this
category
just
the
right
amount
of
apricots
and
a
good
wheat
backbone
ill
go
back
to
this
brew
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
being
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
but
theres
no
reason
not
to
drink
it
its
a
very
serviceable
beer
and
a
bit
of
a
novelty
which
makes
it
fun
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
crisp
refreshing
beer
pretty
appropriate
for
a
hot
sunny
afternoon
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
that
makes
it
something
i
could
probably
drink
one
or
two
of
in
a
sitting
12
oz
bottle
poured
out
an
orange
color
with
next
to
no
head
obviously
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
apricot
also
it
has
wheat
flavor
but
the
apricot
flavor
was
overpowering
it
had
a
fizzy
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
highly
drinkable
i
had
such
a
hard
time
drinking
it
that
i
let
my
wife
finish
it
delicious
this
is
my
first
apricot
beer
the
flavors
blend
quite
well
at
least
with
pyramids
yes
the
scent
and
taste
is
dominated
by
apricot
but
the
flavor
of
the
fruit
goes
well
with
beer
in
my
opinion
it
pours
out
a
cloudy
goldorange
the
smell
is
pure
apricot
the
taste
is
nearly
the
same
little
bit
of
fizziness
and
a
lingering
cottonmouth
aftertaste
i
could
have
done
without
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
this
is
a
fruity
summer
beer
its
drinkable
but
very
one
dimensional
the
taste
will
appeal
more
to
malternative
drinkers
than
beer
drinkers
not
a
big
fruit
beer
fan
myself
but
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
one
poured
it
into
my
pint
glass
and
noticed
a
nice
head
dissapear
into
less
than
a
thin
film
the
color
was
a
light
orange
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
the
smell
was
with
out
a
doubt
apricot
i
couldnt
smell
anything
else
the
taste
was
much
the
same
all
apricot
it
wasnt
an
overpowering
flavor
either
i
think
thats
why
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
it
was
very
smooth
with
a
nice
body
to
it
just
right
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
since
the
flavor
of
apricots
lingered
for
so
long
drinkability
i
like
fruit
beers
as
a
change
of
pace
and
this
one
is
very
drinkable
it
could
be
a
lot
better
with
a
bit
more
character
and
hop
balance
this
is
an
orangish
beer
with
a
thin
brittle
white
head
that
basically
smells
like
peach
airfreshener
the
taste
is
a
light
but
nonetheless
artificial
tasting
candy
reminds
me
of
jolly
ranchers
peach
apricot
flavor
that
overwhelms
any
discernable
malt
flavors
very
floral
hops
enhance
the
trick
nicely
and
a
hint
of
yeast
in
the
finish
makes
a
futile
attempt
to
dry
things
this
beer
is
a
bit
artificial
tasting
for
me
but
the
fact
that
i
tasted
both
hops
and
yeast
in
it
impressed
me
somewhat
lifting
carbonation
is
pleasant
cloying
qualities
kept
me
from
wanting
more
some
people
love
this
stuff
you
should
try
it
once
although
im
not
crazy
about
fruit
beers
not
counting
cantillion
and
the
like
this
beer
is
better
than
i
remembered
from
past
experiences
it
looks
nice
in
the
glass
although
the
head
is
weak
and
fades
fast
this
beer
definitely
delivers
in
the
apricot
department
the
smell
is
all
apricot
with
the
faintest
hint
of
malt
or
maybe
its
my
imagination
the
taste
is
all
apricot
with
hardly
any
of
the
weizen
flavors
coming
through
i
noticed
that
10
minutes
after
i
finished
this
beer
the
apricot
flavor
still
lingered
i
really
was
impressed
by
the
mouthfeel
a
nice
medium
texture
the
carbonation
seemed
just
right
not
too
fizzy
but
lively
enough
for
the
light
flavor
anyone
who
buys
this
beer
looking
for
apricot
flavor
will
no
doubt
be
satisfied
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
apricot
scent
along
with
the
standard
weizen
aroma
its
dry
yet
quite
fruity
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
wonderful
apricot
presence
that
refreshes
and
is
quite
enjoyable
however
it
also
has
a
dry
earthy
finish
that
seems
a
bit
sour
and
clovey
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
its
just
not
my
favorite
fruitbeer
combo
smell
is
of
a
multitude
of
different
fruits
apricot
is
very
noticeable
but
without
a
doubt
there
is
a
strong
presence
of
pear
andor
mango
although
there
are
fragments
of
fruit
contained
in
the
bottle
pour
is
smooth
with
a
nice
dark
coulour
head
is
thick
in
complexion
retention
is
also
longer
than
expected
and
a
fairly
thick
lace
remains
after
the
head
has
fully
disappeared
taste
as
expected
is
very
fruity
possibly
too
fruity
many
different
flavors
are
present
at
the
same
time
so
it
is
a
bit
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
nice
try
for
those
unfamiliar
with
the
category
this
very
fragrant
beer
is
probably
even
better
on
tap
smooth
flavor
light
effervescence
all
over
tongue
and
palate
a
touch
dry
tart
with
a
pleasant
apricotmalt
aftertaste
that
lingers
nicely
and
fades
slowly
evenly
mediumbodied
definitely
worth
a
try
good
stuff
by
the
way
i
am
new
to
reviewing
beers
im
sure
ill
get
better
at
it
i
gave
his
girlfriend
a
couple
of
weizen
glasses
a
few
months
ago
so
i
conveniently
have
the
proper
glassware
it
pours
light
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
shrinks
fairly
quickly
i
feel
like
im
opening
a
bag
of
dried
apricots
when
i
smell
this
beer
the
taste
sure
doesnt
disappoint
its
actually
better
then
it
could
have
been
the
flavor
is
filled
with
apricots
but
it
tastes
like
beer
rather
then
some
sweet
concoction
there
is
a
faint
but
noticeable
hop
presence
upfront
which
is
followed
by
light
wheat
notes
again
the
apricots
are
everywhere
so
you
should
probably
pass
on
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
apricots
but
if
you
do
like
apricots
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
look
forward
to
picking
up
a
sixpack
real
soon
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
fruit
this
is
not
a
syrupy
sweetly
sticky
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
well
made
sessionable
beer
if
you
feel
that
most
beers
that
use
fruit
go
overboard
to
the
point
that
they
ruin
the
beer
characteristics
this
maybe
one
that
you
want
to
give
a
try
d
this
is
one
of
the
beers
to
get
beer
haters
to
drink
not
my
thing
though
it
was
wirth
trying
but
i
doubt
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
if
you
like
apricots
or
maybe
mangoes
youll
love
this
beer
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
i
guess
id
call
it
a
beer
with
a
chick
twist
they
really
should
market
it
towards
young
women
drinkability
a
decent
fruit
beer
and
id
like
to
compare
it
to
the
apricot
ale
to
see
if
it
is
any
different
i
cant
recall
from
memory
what
the
apricot
ale
tastes
like
but
thats
what
my
wife
thought
it
was
when
she
bought
it
cheers
drinkability
total
drain
pour
i
give
the
drinkability
rating
a
little
leeway
because
i
think
i
am
drinking
an
outdated
possibly
oxidized
bottle
the
bottling
date
on
the
label
is
blurred
so
i
do
not
know
how
old
this
is
easy
to
drink
its
not
breathtaking
but
its
pleasant
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
perfect
in
a
restaurant
waiting
at
the
bar
for
the
rest
of
your
party
nothing
thats
going
to
destroy
your
pallet
for
later
on
but
still
something
youll
enjoy
something
to
drink
slowly
while
theres
a
lot
of
subtlety
in
the
flavor
and
smell
the
flavors
and
smells
you
really
notice
are
simple
and
immediate
worth
analyzing
once
but
not
going
to
get
much
out
of
a
second
try
that
you
didnt
get
the
first
time
crisp
and
fairly
smooth
definitely
drinkable
if
you
like
apricot
drinkability
didnt
carry
with
it
the
weize
drinkability
as
do
others
plus
the
flavor
was
so
faked
i
might
be
able
to
fit
two
beers
for
an
evening
and
thats
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
small
head
forms
no
lace
to
speak
of
smell
is
all
apricots
with
a
little
bit
of
honey
sweetness
and
floralcitrus
taste
is
sweet
and
apricot
fruit
some
floral
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
not
bad
not
good
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
subtle
creaminess
and
plenty
of
carbonation
quite
refreshing
really
i
could
see
this
going
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
reminds
me
of
ofallon
wheach
worth
looking
into
if
youre
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
apricots
or
both
unfiltered
as
well
the
amount
of
apricot
taste
this
beer
has
is
pretty
impressive
and
even
more
impressive
is
the
smell
i
was
actually
a
little
afraid
of
what
it
was
going
to
taste
like
before
trying
it
it
has
a
pleasent
sweet
taste
but
the
sweetness
is
not
excessive
or
overpowering
probably
a
bit
more
refreshing
than
alot
of
the
other
fruit
beers
i
have
had
id
recommend
this
ober
most
of
the
fruit
beers
i
have
had
nice
tasty
light
what
i
was
expecting
thanks
pyramid
really
not
terrible
for
a
fruit
beer
the
apricot
taste
is
remarkably
unoffensive
and
i
could
probably
grab
another
after
i
was
finished
with
the
first
one
probably
not
one
id
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
there
are
much
worse
fruit
beers
out
there
my
first
fruit
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
nice
carbonation
no
head
nice
lacing
throughout
scents
of
wheat
sweet
apricots
very
nice
taste
sweet
and
mellow
light
bodied
nice
aftertaste
this
goes
down
like
koolaidwater
could
drink
quite
a
few
but
watch
out
for
the
alcohol
content
drinkability
is
really
quite
good
tasty
refreshing
wheat
beer
that
would
be
good
as
a
summer
thirst
quencher
or
a
sunday
brunch
beer
not
sweet
enough
for
a
dessert
beer
but
this
would
go
very
well
with
a
salad
or
fruit
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
one
sided
the
fruit
side
if
youre
into
apricots
then
you
will
dig
it
ive
been
curious
to
grab
a
sizer
of
this
for
about
a
year
now
am
i
glad
i
picked
this
single
out
at
a
wine
shop
instead
not
good
at
all
at
first
this
one
poured
nice
looked
appealing
smelled
great
that
was
all
the
taste
is
bland
with
the
slightest
hint
of
apricot
sour
and
thin
this
one
was
one
of
the
biggest
disappointments
ive
had
in
a
long
while
for
the
first
time
in
months
i
left
a
quarter
of
it
in
the
glass
so
much
for
my
beer
quote
on
my
profile
not
the
apricot
ale
but
an
apricot
weizen
never
seen
it
before
and
in
vegas
its
hot
so
it
sounded
like
a
quencher
pours
a
cloudy
sunset
with
a
weak
head
ok
smells
fruity
grainy
beery
taste
is
refreshing
to
say
the
least
def
not
a
powerhouse
of
taste
explosions
but
tastey
nonetheless
crisp
and
refreshing
like
their
usual
weizen
american
wheat
beer
cough
cough
but
with
a
nice
apricot
smack
lightly
tart
with
a
nice
finishing
bite
light
and
refreshing
almost
a
bit
creamy
this
is
a
decent
brew
hell
forget
decent
its
a
pretty
good
brew
good
hot
weather
grab
body
is
rather
thin
but
slick
and
thirst
quenching
nontheless
medium
body
and
mouthfeel
that
was
dextrinous
and
semislick
the
hops
never
bitter
but
clearing
the
sweet
apricot
flavor
persist
till
end
i
would
like
a
crisper
finish
if
possible
i
would
describe
the
apricots
as
cloying
not
the
sweetness
feels
like
i
fell
asleep
under
the
apricot
tree
and
somehow
all
the
fruit
was
shaken
off
and
covered
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
pile
i
would
expect
this
to
attract
bees
on
the
deck
on
a
summers
day
pours
a
very
appealing
cloudy
copperamber
with
golden
yellow
highlights
around
the
edges
and
a
small
white
head
which
lasts
for
a
minute
or
so
looks
like
a
cross
between
an
amber
and
a
hefeweissen
smell
is
dried
apricots
right
up
front
quite
sweet
with
some
grainy
aftertones
taste
is
more
apricot
with
a
steady
balance
of
wheat
grass
not
particularly
malty
or
hoppy
but
the
bitter
wheat
balances
out
the
sweet
fruit
quite
well
reminded
me
of
a
apricot
version
of
tommyknockers
jack
whacker
wheat
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
i
like
a
wellcarbonated
fruit
beer
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
evening
cloudy
goldenorange
with
a
nice
fluffy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
candy
sweet
apricots
it
really
smells
fresh
and
juicy
some
malty
wheat
character
is
there
too
this
is
still
a
beer
after
all
apricots
are
just
as
prominent
in
the
flavor
with
a
strong
and
unique
sweettartness
the
classic
weizen
malt
character
is
present
to
some
extent
though
other
hefeweizen
flavors
such
as
banana
and
clove
are
absent
they
would
taste
pretty
screwed
up
when
clashing
with
apricot
i
imagine
tartness
affects
drinkability
to
some
extent
but
its
still
quite
a
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
so
far
ive
hated
most
fruit
beers
ive
tried
but
i
have
to
give
this
one
a
strong
recommendation
i
like
this
beer
because
the
apricots
know
their
place
in
the
body
of
the
beer
the
colour
is
a
pretty
pinky
brown
and
the
nose
is
like
a
bowl
of
apricots
the
beer
part
is
pretty
ok
but
the
fruit
part
is
what
really
makes
this
work
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
and
food
friendly
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers
drinkability
not
for
me
while
i
havent
tried
other
apricot
flavored
beer
id
prefer
raspberry
maybe
if
it
was
a
stronger
apricot
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
is
tremendous
the
smell
is
strongly
of
sugar
and
apercot
not
much
more
there
the
taste
is
simply
the
same
thing
just
sugar
and
apercots
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
like
you
are
biting
into
the
fruit
itself
they
must
have
a
special
way
of
harnessing
the
taste
great
for
summer
the
nose
is
all
apricot
the
apricot
taste
hits
hard
and
is
followed
by
a
bready
flavour
before
the
apricot
reasserts
itself
with
a
very
slight
hop
finish
this
is
refreshing
and
rather
as
one
would
expect
it
is
too
sweet
for
a
session
beer
this
old
friend
is
back
in
my
state
after
a
hiatus
of
4
years
time
has
not
hurt
this
brew
and
tastes
as
good
as
it
did
the
first
time
i
had
it
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
decent
foamy
head
beer
smells
of
apricotorange
taste
is
fantastic
a
fusion
of
wheat
and
apricot
that
makes
this
a
must
have
for
summer
a
session
beer
in
my
opinion
nonetheless
i
found
that
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
1
because
it
was
too
fruity
and
sweet
pours
a
cloudy
yellowishorange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
is
dominated
by
apricots
with
a
fruity
esters
background
but
still
the
apricot
smell
is
slightly
overwhelming
taste
is
your
basic
american
wheat
beer
with
an
apricot
theme
interesting
but
not
exactly
a
great
beer
the
apricot
flavor
in
a
american
wheat
is
intriguing
because
its
more
refreshing
than
youd
expect
but
im
not
sure
it
was
a
good
decision
anyways
definately
something
slightly
different
to
try
but
not
really
a
sucess
in
my
book
pyramid
also
has
a
brewery
in
berkeley
ca
its
on
gilman
just
west
of
san
pablo
i
think
ill
pay
them
a
visit
next
time
im
in
the
bay
area
light
and
billowy
in
the
mouth
with
soft
and
easy
carbonation
not
a
whole
lot
to
grab
on
to
here
but
better
than
most
attempts
at
a
fruit
infused
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
smells
of
ripe
apricots
and
a
slight
grassy
hop
aroma
as
well
tastes
like
apricots
as
expected
but
not
overly
so
there
is
a
discernible
hop
flavor
that
lingers
towards
the
finish
which
is
clean
and
slightly
dry
this
is
a
very
refreshing
light
fruit
beer
i
am
kind
of
bummed
that
i
have
only
found
singles
in
specs
so
far
a
somewhat
different
but
very
good
brew
the
beer
escapes
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
limpid
amber
color
with
a
modest
sized
frothy
light
tan
head
after
its
decomposition
the
lace
forms
a
thin
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
heavy
on
the
apricots
fresh
and
crisp
sweet
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
malt
profile
decent
the
top
fair
to
middling
in
feel
finish
has
a
pronounced
acidity
with
the
hops
light
in
spiciness
the
aftertaste
tart
and
dry
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
is
average
at
best
i
could
drink
it
again
but
the
apricot
flavor
could
get
old
eventually
lightmedium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
taste
is
pretty
straightforward
its
all
apricot
some
sweetness
comes
in
but
never
gets
to
be
too
much
a
pretty
easydrinking
noncomplex
fruit
beer
i
barely
got
through
one
bottle
and
i
doubt
ill
ever
try
this
one
again
too
sweet
a
beer
for
me
as
apricots
are
mostly
too
sweet
a
fruit
i
admit
my
bias
for
fans
of
the
fruit
i
imagine
this
is
a
good
beer
ratings
say
worth
a
try
i
say
avoid
edit
this
was
the
original
apricot
ale
need
to
try
the
new
name
and
see
if
it
is
audacious
this
beer
came
to
me
a
golden
brown
color
with
orange
highlights
on
the
edges
decently
carbonated
and
had
a
slight
haze
to
it
head
that
was
created
was
white
thick
creamy
and
on
the
sticky
side
patches
of
a
foamy
lace
were
present
but
not
in
my
opinion
a
true
lace
simple
aromas
came
from
the
glass

lots
of
apricots
wheat
grains
and
wisps
of
hops
a
beer
that
is
what
the
label
states
the
flavors
were
just
as
the
aromas
fresh
picked
apricots
some
sweet
malts
wheat
grain
tones
some
sugar
and
citrus
hops
from
beginning
to
the
end
aftertaste
was
light
the
body
was
on
the
medium
side
smooth
and
creamy
beer
was
rather
pleased
and
happy
with
this
beer
not
one
i
would
drink
in
quantity
but
a
nice
treat
and
would
drink
again
especially
during
dessert
drinkability
ill
still
continue
to
try
the
rest
of
the
pyramid
line
but
this
is
not
my
taste
for
a
beer
apricot
ale
tastes
pretty
much
as
youd
expect
it
tastes
like
apricots
its
a
sugary
honeyed
nectar
with
enough
wheat
to
make
the
beer
cuttingly
refreshing
despite
its
abundant
sweetness
but
on
the
whole
it
basically
tastes
like
sucking
down
the
syrup
out
of
a
tin
of
apricots
i
suppose
it
might
work
in
a
dessert
setting
and
it
could
probably
be
used
in
a
killer
recipe
but
it
completely
fails
in
scratching
that
beer
itch
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
i
will
say
this
in
defense
of
fruit
beers
apricots
and
peaches
pears
squash
pumpkin
and
apples
for
that
matter
work
much
better
with
beer
flavors
than
berries
or
cherries
its
just
a
better
marriage
or
it
could
just
be
a
personal
preference
dogfish
head
made
a
good
beer
with
aprihop
which
succesfully
married
the
sweetness
of
the
apricot
with
the
citric
bitterness
of
the
hops
it
worked
well
and
i
would
recommend
that
one
over
pyramids
abundantly
sweet
version
however
if
youre
an
apricot
nut
with
a
severe
sweet
tooth
or
some
sort
of
bee
or
fruit
fly
you
will
probably
prefer
the
pyramid
pours
a
clear
and
bright
goldenorange
in
color
fizzy
layer
of
dying
white
head
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
are
pronounced
apricots
maybe
with
a
spoonful
of
sugar
on
them
not
much
else
but
the
smell
sure
didnt
need
it
very
nice
flavor
is
also
loaded
with
apricots
with
a
breadydoughy
finish
to
it
theres
barely
any
bitterness
to
this
beer
apricots
remain
on
the
palate
long
after
the
finish
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
great
summer
beer
hazy
apricot
color
what
else
with
a
thin
white
head
that
lowers
quickly
and
flattens
out
to
nothing
smell
is
sweet
apricots
almost
candylike
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
leading
to
a
flavor
that
is
sweet
apricot
maybe
too
much
like
apricot
and
not
enough
like
beer
the
wheat
flavor
is
diminished
by
the
apricot
no
hops
come
through
although
there
is
a
tingly
bite
in
the
finish
but
its
not
hoppy
sort
of
tannic
a
bit
like
apricot
juice
average
body
and
it
went
down
nice
and
smooth
really
a
nice
little
treat
overall
not
a
bad
summer
brew

is
better

happy
apricot
beering
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
smell
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
fresh
ripe
apricots
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
apricot
flavor
but
its
surprisingly
not
as
sweet
as
expected
wheat
and
malt
flavors
are
also
there
but
the
apricot
is
dominant
minimally
hopped
slight
sour
aftertaste
id
recommend
that
anybody
try
this
beer
at
least
once
its
a
nice
novelty
but
i
dont
think
it
will
be
one
of
my
regulars
served
up
in
a
stubby
pilsner
and
poured
a
golden
wheat
color
with
heavy
carbination
very
light
head
reduced
to
a
light
ring
heavy
fresh
apricot
scent
wow
tastes
of
frest
fruits
and
of
apricot
nectar
but
not
too
sweet
the
flavor
stays
with
you
yeah
it
is
kind
of
girly
sounding
and
may
scare
of
alot
of
the
guys
but
if
you
buck
up
and
try
it
you
may
find
that
you
actually
like
it
if
you
are
one
for
the
fruit
beers
it
could
work
as
a
nice
session
beer
small
head
is
almost
white
coarse
noisy
beer

a
slightly
orangey

a
couple
of
small
spots
of

sweet
sweet
apricot
in
the
nose
not
much
else
of
note
apricot
in
the
front
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
fairly
light
fruity
middle
leads
to
a
nice
nutty
grainsy
finish
not
a
great
aftertaste
though
a
little
sour
a
little
chemical
but
i
like
it
its
a
light
fresh
fruity
sweetbutnotcloying
beer
i
probably
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
apricot
ale
is
not
good
beer
either
in
a
general
sense
or
when
judged
against
other
fruit
beer
it
needs
to
have
a
more
substantial
body
and
it
needs
to
replace
a
large
portion
of
its
sourness
with
sweetness
pyramid
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
pours
a
clear
honey
tone
color
with
a
nice
112
finger
white
dense
head
the
smell
consists
of
sweet
apricot
of
course
and
a
very
faint
grain
but
not
much
else
going
on
actually
in
a
blind
smell
test
i
dont
think
i
would
have
known
it
was
beer
the
taste
is
again
strong
apricot
with
only
a
hint
of
malt
a
very
slight
touch
of
hops
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
and
is
almost
overwhelmingly
sweet
but
still
manages
a
tart
dry
finish
not
bad
but
definitely
not
great
cheers
this
beer
has
some
great
qualities
i
like
a
few
fruit
beers
and
this
is
one
of
them
have
this
on
tap
at
pyramid
before
mariner
games
the
apperance
is
a
reddish
honey
with
a
white
head
that
dissapears
but
on
tap
this
had
great
lacing
throughout
the
smell
is
of
apricots
and
honey
hops
are
sublte
but
are
there
the
taste
is
not
to
bad
sort
of
a
citrus
and
apricots
with
malty
aftertaste
fells
fruity
but
dull
in
the
mouth
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
a
little
to
fruity
than
i
would
like
one
of
the
best
pyramid
all
year
beers
though
overall
and
interesting
and
unique
brew
a
little
too
in
your
face
for
my
liking
sweet
apricots
ive
passed
this
beer
numerous
times
in
the
beer
isles
throughout
the
years
and
glad
i
finally
gave
it
a
try
i
would
be
very
curious
to
taste
this
baby
in
the
pacific
nw
on
tap
im
sure
id
be
singin
a
different
tune
poured
a
semi
cloudy
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
small
head
beautiful
aroma
of
sweet
ripe
apricot
nectar
with
a
touch
of
zesty
lemon
the
taste
is
light
and
is
undeniably
flavored
with
apricots
light
in
body
thats
sweetened
with
fruit
its
wonderful
how
the
fruit
flavor
is
incorporated
into
this
beer
its
done
perfectly
not
overly
sweet
nor
underdone
a
sweet
nectar
tang
is
left
on
the
tongue
light
fruity
and
a
very
refreshing
treat
of
a
beer
very
nice
this
was
one
of
my
first
favorites
but
its
really
more
of
a
summer
beer
refreshing
and
overall
of
satisfactory
quality
no
more
syrupy
film
on
the
lips
id
have
to
say
that
youd
better
like
apricots
to
drink
this
beer
if
you
do

tastes
a
lot
like
peach
water
meh
i
tried
this
on
a
hot
day
in
florida
since
i
thought
it
might
hit
the
spot
and
its
just
not
doing
it
for
me
the
aroma
and
taste
were
like
the
syrup
from
a
can
of
peaches
which
i
personally
dont
find
appetizing
i
understand
it
says
real
peaches
but
i
just
wasnt
tasting
a
fresh
peach
there
maybe
it
was
just
not
the
right
batch
poured
a
hazy
orange
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
some
sparse
lacing
smells
of
peach
obviously
tastes
more
artificialrotten
peach
than
fresh
peach
feels
good
in
the
mouth
but
the
taste
overpowers
anything
good
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
wheat
ale
great
peach
taste
much
better
than
i
could
have
imagined
wonderful
cool
peach
flavor
thats
not
overpowering
or
phony
tasting
a
bit
dark
for
what
id
expect
a
peach
ale
to
look
like
but
comes
through
clean
and
smooth
had
a
very
artificial
peach
character
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
not
something
ill
be
revisiting
smell
and
taste
of
the
best
peaches
you
can
buy
in
south
carolina
the
best
summer
brew
available
phenomenal
beer
strange
bitterness
at
the
end
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
touches
of
amber
medium
collar
great
lacing
good
wisps
and
decent
head
aroma
is
great
like
a
fresh
juicy
peach
with
a
some
wheatiness
to
it
as
well
taste
is
where
it
falls
off
a
bit
i
get
the
peach
but
it
tastes
manufactured
peach
up
front
wheaty
banana
in
the
middle
and
some
odd
bitter
spiciness
at
the
end
medium
body
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
grainy
mouthfeel
too
o
i
could
see
this
being
an
extremely
refreshing
change
of
pace
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
highly
recommend
this
beer
very
tasty
quite
possibly
the
most
pleasing
beer
by
smell
ive
ever
encountered
the
taste
was
light
and
peachy
very
sweet
can
barely
taste
the
wheat
beer
the
wheat
gives
it
a
very
creamy
finish
which
compliments
the
flavor
overall
an
outstanding
fruit
beer
overall
this
beer
looks
and
starts
well
but
the
finish
and
flavor
are
off
putting
too
dry
and
not
balanced
possibly
a
bad
batch
too
much
peach
here
too
much
sweetness
for
me
the
peach
is
huge
in
the
nose
theres
some
hop
character
toward
the
end
but
not
too
much
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
by
the
sweet
peach
flavor
overall
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
departure
of
the
norm
since
i
typically
dont
do
fruity
beers
excellent
summer
beer
for
a
breakaway
from
the
norm
good
if
you
like
a
sweet
fruit
beer
i
like
this
beer
the
peach
flavor
keeps
it
from
being
too
hoppy
not
pretentious
just
a
good
beer
and
the
5

doesnt
hurt
either
o
i
would
have
liked
a
more
intense
peach
flavor
m
other
than
the
lingering
sulfuric
finish
the
body
is
appropriately
light
and
well
carbonated
meh
not
that
great
there
are
better
fruity
wheat
beers
i
had
this
at
packs
tavern
in
asheville
how
long
foes
the
comment
length
need
to
be
to
be
acceptable
i
feel
like
i
ant
up
if
just
for
the
hell
out
of
it
just
get
a
lambic
if
you
want
fruity
or
allagash
white
for
a
better
wheat
this
is
medium
to
lighter
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
decent
fruited
wheat
nothing
more
or
less
i
suppose
it
should
be
noted
that
this
packs
about
as
much
peach
character
as
you
can
naturally
get
in
a
brew
with
only
a
slight

going
on
in
it

to
my

this
is

if
you

peach
flavored
drinks
then
you
will
like
this
beer
it
has
a

look
to
it
their
is
not
that
much

like
some
beers
have
the
smell
is
really
good
the
taste
is
also
really
good
as
well
tou
actually
can
taste
the
peach
flavor
that
it
has
it
is
not
too
strong
like
some
beers
are
it
is
not
a
heavy
beer
but
it
is
also
not
too
light
at
the
sametime
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
color
smells
like
a
peach
creamsickle
vanilla
ice
cream
and
peach
preserves
in
the
flavor
really
bright
and
peachy
little
bitterness
some
toffee
flavors
to
go
with
sugary
peaches
a

this
is
a

i
had
this
beer
on
a
whim
i
saw
it
in
the
cooler
at
work
as
a
special
craft
night
beer
i
popped
it
after
hours
and
took
a
few
sips
i
figured
it
would
be
nice
and
refreshing
and
boy
was
i
right
it
was
so
sweet
and
perfect
pale
ale
and
had
amazing
peach
hints
through
the
whole
experience
to
me
it
would
be
an
amazing
summer
beer
i
loved
it
so
much
our
local
sams
club
sales
local
beers
and
i
stocked
up
favorite
for
now
overall
an
above
average
peachy
ale
that
has
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
fruit
nothing
groundbreaking
but
i
could
see
myself
finishing
off
a
six
pack
quickly
during
the
warmer

after
this
beer
was
done
i
made
a
mental
note
to
get
a
good
belgian
white
with
no
fruit
time
to
get
back
to
basics
o
the
best
fruitwheat
beer
ive
had
to
date
outstanding
use
of
peach
in
this
one
on
tap
its
a
bit
better
but
still
this
is
a
great
sessionable
fruit
beer
poured
into

pint
glass
pours
a
medium
peachy
golden
amber
with
a
huge
white
head
with
decent
retention
and

aroma
dominated
by
fresh
peach
juice
with
hints
of
biscuit
malt
and
wheat
flavor
follows
aroma
with
peachy
biscuit
malt
and
wheat
a
light
hop
and

finish
light
to
medium
bodied
the
peach
is
nice
but
this
leaned
more
towards
a
light
amber
ale
profile
than
a
wheat
ale
i
think
i
would
have
liked
this
peach
melded
with
a
more
distinct
classic
wheat
ale
high
scores
on
the
deft
use
of
peach
juice
but
less
so

as
a
first
experience
this
was
not
a
bad
one
for
seasonal
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
given
the
opportunity
but
at
the
same
time
i
will
not
go
apecrazy
for
it
when
i
see
it
on
tap
if
youre
into
fruit
flavored
beer
this
might
be
right
up
your
alley

abv
not
a
bad
fruit
flavored
seasonal
the
peach
taste
is
not
too
lite
or
too
strong
i
could
last
through
a
6er
with
this
one
the
best
part
is
there
is
no
over
dose
of
sweetness
and
the
aftertaste
is
works
which
seems
to
be
main
problem
with
a
fruit
flavored
beer
i
would
buy
again
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
awesome
just
like
a
fuzzed
up
peach
the
rest
of
the
experience
is
not
so
interesting
i
am
sure
these
beers
have
an
appeal
in
the
mass
market
but
i
am
looking
for
other
things
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
while
it
has
heavy
peach
flavoring
its
not
sweet
at
all
so
you
can
have
more
than
one
and
not
od
on
the
sweetness
that
is
the
downfall
of
many
fruity
beers
in
my
opinion
give
it
a
shot
and
see
if
you
like
it
ive
definitely
had
much
worse
id
buy
this
for
my
home
i
originally
had
it
at
a
bar
happy
tasting
would
not
buy
again
heavy
on
peach
not
so
great
on
the
beer
flavor
i
mixed
peach
schnapps
and
apricot
brandy
with
it
to
make
it
palatable
so
i
could
finish
the
remaining
5
bottles
my
brother
didnt
care
for
it
oh
well
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwkxyz
overall
i
will
return
to
it
cause
im
certain
i
tasted
an
old
or
just
plain
ol
bad
batch
but
if
this
is
what
this
beer
is
than
i
am
mortified
sad
to
say
but
id
pick
a
big
brewery
beer
over
this
one
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
the
aroma
is
strongly
of
peach
i
also
get
some
of
the
malt
the
peach
is
also
strong
in
the
flavor
theres
some
balacing
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
its
not
very
strong
i
also
get
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
you
get
whats
advertised
very
nicely
done
peach
wheat
refreshing
clean
and
i
dig
it
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
great
with
food
or
on
a
hot
day
wish
the
peaches
came
rhrough
a
little
more
tart
instead
of
sweet
bottom
line
peaches
if
only
the
ale
could
have
carried
those
tantilizing
aromas
through
to
taste
and
texture
as
well
and
we
could
have
something
special
but
the
beer
is
worth
the
purchase
based
on
aromas
alone
this
one
can
be
a
chick
beer
or
a
summer
favorite
o
if
this
was
not
a
3
special
i
would
have
complained
and
sent
it
back
im
highly
disappointed
in
this
considering
how
many
people
rave
about
this
beer
i
hate
being
so
negative
but
i
liked
nothing
that
this
beer
had
to
offer
i
wouldnt
put
this
on
your
shirt
list
my
angry
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
bubbly
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
unfiltered
indeed
it
was
a
cloudy
orangishamber
in
color
which
made
me
angry
i
feel
a
mean
drunk
coming
on
nose
was
as
peachy
as
georgia
and
trying
to
decide
how
much
of
that
was
real
peaches
and
how
much
was
natural
flavor
added
just
made
me
angry
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
the
peaches
almost
had
a
preservelike
sweetness
that
was
thankfully
offset
by
the
wheat
or
i
might
have
been
angry
finish
was
slightly
tart
but
definitely
peachy
it
all
added
up
to
a
beer
that
made
me
mean
and
angry
enough
to
fire
the
empty
bottle
through
my
neighbors
window
now
ive
got
the
fuzz
to
boot
not
a
very
pleasant
experience
this
beer
should
be
dialed
down
to
about
4
and
feature
a
stronger
wheat
profile
o
a
drinkable
if
mundane
fruited
american
wheat
beer
it
has
neither
the
fruity
intensity
of
a
peach
lambic
nor
the
refreshing
flair
of
a
bavarian
hefeweizen
either
of
which
id
choose
over
this
beer
any
day
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
almost
pulls
everything
together
it
is
a
bit
thin
to
be
great
but
definitely
worth
picking
up
on
relaxing
southern
summer
day
nice
use
of
fruit
balances
well
smells
like
deliciousness
but
drinks
a
little
shy
of
that
goal
bonus
points
for
being
refreshing
o
one
of
my
favorite
summer
time
brews
i
find
it
refreshing
after
cutting
the
lawn
or
relaxing
on
my
patio
this
years
offering
had
a
lot
more
floating
around
in
my
glass
kinda
weird
watching
those
chunks
working
around
in
there
i
look
forward
to
this
brew
every
summer
served
this
beer
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
produced
a
nice
white
head
great
retention
and
left
ample
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
malted
wheat
and
peaches
medium
bodied
the
base
of
this
american
wheat
ale
consisted
of
soft
malted
wheat
clover
honey
and
fresh
peaches
sweet
and
semi
tart
there
is
not
any
noticeable
hop
flavor
the
peach
aroma
is
stronger
then
the
taste
it
actually
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
peach
and
malted
wheat
there
is
a
fine
line
when
adding
fruit
to
a
wheat
ale
and
rj
rockers
did
a
good
job
of
not
crossing
it
with
this
ale
overall
a
very
good
fruit
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
then
you
must
try
this
one
o
this
type
of
beer
is
not
for
everyone
the
massive
amount
of
peaches
steers
many
away
i
really
like
it
it
is
quite
different
but
refreshing
it
packs
a
punch
for
its
style
at
around
6
not
an
overly
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
works
for
me
a
great
tasting
peach
wheat
ale
light
in
color
with
an
amazing
taste
very
sweet
goes
great
w
a
salty
pretzel
but
i
only
like
to
drink
one
because
its
so
so
sweet
most
fruity
beers
are
i
only
wish
i
like
the
rest
of
rj
rockers
beers
which
dont
doanything
for
me
and
my
beer
buddys
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
giant
foamy
head
that
takes
several
minutes
to
settle
there
was
great
lacing
and
retention
before
settling
there
is
heavy
sediment
and
cloudiness
the
nose
is
sweet
with
a
huge
amount
of
peach
fruitiness
the
taste
doesnt
follow
the
beers
nose
with
a
slight
amount
of
peach
and
a
big
amount
of
wheat
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
as
expected
not
too
thickthin
but
there
is
an
odd
aftertaste
that
deviates
from
my
expectations
i
would
probably
drink
this
beer
again
but
id
opt
for
an
ithaca
apricot
wheat
instead
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
carbonation
a
little
more
not
much
of
a
finish
tastes
slightly
artificial
when
its
all
said
and
done
still
i
gotta
give
it
props
for
being
a
pretty
decent
beer
in
what
i
view
as
a
somewhat
bland
style
overall
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
not
too
big
on
wheat
beers
but
this
is
really
good
overall
in
the
nose
department
its
amazing
and
everywhere
else
it
kinda
falls
off
and
disappoints
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
authentic
and
robust
the
peach
aroma
and
flavoring
was
at
no
point
did
it
feel
synthetic
or
overdone
the
nose
sung
of
summer
peaches
and
cream
while
the
taste
followed
through
nicely
with
nice
even
sweetness
and
a
bitter
finish
at
the
way
end
we
wish
that
the
sweetness
had
remained
just
a
bit
longer
to
help
better
balance
the
sourness
and
bitterness
of
the
final
flavors
this
is
a
highly
refreshing
beer
but
due
to
the
glorious
peach
insanity
this
guy
will
remain
for
special
occasions
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
the
odd
medicinal
flavor
through
me
off
but
even
that
aside
nothing
seemed
to
meld
together
and
the
flavors
were
all
over
the
place
not
a
good
effort
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
body
with
a
very
small
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
long
the
smell
is
like
smelling
a
fresh
peach
also
with
some
faint
wheat
notes
the
taste
is
of
a
nice
peach
flavor
with
wheat
in
the
back
ground
also
has
some
hop
bitterness
to
it
also
the
mouth
feel
is
great
goes
down
easy
and
is
refreshing
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
and
tasty
summer
beer
oglad
i
tried
it
above
average
not
bad
but
nothing
i
will
buy
again
would
be
a
better
beer
at
a
lower
abv
in
my
opinion
overall
impression
a
decent
brew
by
rj
rockers
but
came
a
bit
short
in
my
books
for
this
style
too
artificial
and
you
can
definitely
find
this
in
the
mouthfeel
would
still
order
again
because
of
its
refreshing
aroma
and
beginning
of
taste
but
not
going
to
be
on
my
top
100
list
anytime
soon
o
an
okay
beer
that
isnt
too
bad
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
bitter
flavors
are
a
bit
offputting
and
seem
to
make
it
have
a
bit
of
and
off
flavor
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
too
long
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
beer
smells
mostly
like
peaches
and
peach
syrup
and
a
bit
of
wheat
i
like
the
aroma
of
this
brew
a
lot
however
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
nice
the
peach
taste
seems
more
artificial
to
me
and
theres
a
lingering
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
its
a
decent
enough
brew
overall
i
think
its
also
overpriced
at
10
99
a
6pack
but
i
wont
have
any
problems
finishing
it
i
would
buy
this
again
but
just
not
at
that
price
strong
aroma
has
a
very
firm
overtone
of
peach
it
really
does
smell
like
a
freshly
cut
peach
and
i
love
peaches
it
has
a
wheaty
hint
as
well
pours
a
hazy
nearly
opaque
honey
golden
with
a
thick
and
rather
persistent
palest
honeytan
head
wheaty
flavor
has
a
firm
and
somewhat
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
overtone
of
peach
got
me
thinking
is
it
possible
to
make
peach
cider
or
peach
wine
well
the
japanese
make
plum
wine
pourquoi
pas
ok
enough
digression
texture
has
good
body
and
good
fizz
definitely
some
peach
in
the
finish
if
you
love
peaches
you
should
love
this
beer
o
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
very
nice
if
you
like
peach
beers
then
i
would
recommend
this
one
it
differs
from
others
in
the
fact
that
it
finishes
dry
which
i
like
some
others
can
be
over
the
top
sweet
this
is
a
decent
beer
thats
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
its
worth
trying
o
light
and
easy
to
drink
along
with
being
refreshing
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
how
light
the
peach
flavors
were
though
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
beer
was
not
overly
sweet
or
artificially
flavored
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
very
inviting
odtastes
better
than
it
sounds
wouldnt
order
it
again
would
expect
this
peach
beer
to
taste
worse
appearance
is
a
cloudy
gold
the
thick
white
head
has
good
retention
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
a
noticeable
peach
scent
perhaps
a
bit
of
lemon
in
the
background
the
taste
has
typical
wheat
beer
flavors
of
lemon
and
coriander
but
with
a
touch
of
peach
as
well
to
make
it
interesting
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
slightly
sweet
but
not
overly
fruity
i
havent
had
too
many
fruit
beers
that
ive
cared
for
but
this
one
was
very
good
o
this
one
really
surprised
me
this
is
really
tasty
and
a
great
summerstyle
beer
i
really
love
peaches
so
i
look
forward
to
having
this
one
again
its
very
peachy
and
could
become
one
of
my
regular
summer
rotation
beers
enjoy
i
have
had
this
beer
both
on
tap
and
in
a
bottle
it
is
completely
different
on
tap
the
bottle
left
me
with
a
bad
after
taste
and
sort
of
stale
on
draft
the
beer
is
very
smooth
with
a
burst
of
peach
flavor
overall
i
enjoy
the
beer
but
prefer
their
black
pearle
and
fish
paralyzer
i
had
this
at
the
rj
rockers
brewery
overall
im
not
a
huge
peach
person
but
this
was
a
very
solid
peach
wheat
sure
it
was
overpowering
but
it
was
over
powering
in
a
good
way
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
i
can
definitely
taste
the
higher
abv
in
this
beer
it
has
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
but
think
its
a
great
wheat
beer
o
for
those
who
love
peach
seriously
it
dominates
everything
else
overall
well
i
cant
get
this
locally
and
really
dont
want
to
drink
it
again
was
different
that
sweeter
artificial
flavored
peach
beers
pours
a
cloud
peach
amber
with
a
quickly
fading
soapy
off
white
head
aroma
is
canned
peach
syrup
with
light
wheat
and
straw
grainy
wheat
body
with
surprisingly
not
as
much
sweetness
as
expected
still
artificial
peach
sweetness
dominates
throughout
and
syrup
lingers
through
the
finish
syrupy
medium
thick
body
with
low
carbonation
well
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
expected
and
it
had
less
jolly
rancher
like
quality
to
it
than
others
have
attributed
but
still
not
something
id
return
to
onot
bad
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
though
but
makes
a
nice
refreshing
brew
for
something
a
little
different
appearance
is
gold
with
particles
a
floating
the
way
a
wheat
should
look
smell
is
peachy
which
it
should
have
seeing
it
is
named
son
of
a
peach
mouthfeel
bright
and
evervecent
on
the
tongue
taste
is
nice
if
you
like
peach
the
right
balance
reminds
us
of
that
syrip
in
canned
peaches
overall
as
wheat
beer
it
is
ok
your
typical
style
beer
will
go
well
with
pie
and
whipped
cream
ha
oh
throw
in
some
southern
bbq
o
this
is
a
variant
of
what
cigar
city
does
with
peach
jaialai
i
think
this
is
equally
as
good
though
as
a
different
style
really
enjoying
these
folks
from
sc
when
you
get
a
whiff
you
dont
want
to
stop
smelling
this
beer
it
smells
like
someone
opened
a
can
of
sweet
cling
peaches
and
poured
a
little
bit
of
golden
ale
into
it
this
is
addictive
and
i
wish
the
taste
had
followed
suit
the
peach
is
still
there
but
dried
out
the
wheat
helps
to
bring
peach
cobbler
to
your
thoughts
well
without
the
cinnamon
there
is
an
acridness
that
doesnt
kill
the
experience
but
i
do
wish
it
wasnt
there
as
it
messes
with
the
mouthfeel
otherwise
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
will
say
that
this
is
outstanding
for
the
style
a
real
lady
pleaser
to
boot
o
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
despite
all
of
the
peaches
its
not
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
flavor
isnt
artificially
sweet
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
colored
brew
with
a
white
head
on
top
that
hung
around
for
a
good
amount
of
time
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
nice
peach
aromas
mixed
with
a
touch
of
wheat
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
tart
at
first
catching
me
off
guard
the
more
i
drink
the
sweeter
the
taste
of
the
peach
becomes
and
the
less
sour
it
is
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
its
lighter
bodied
and
refreshing
in
the
warmer
months
overall
this
beer
was
enjoyable
for
me
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
having
it
on
random
occasions
wouldnt
be
bad
o
i
actually
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
after
hearing
about
it
it
came
across
as
just
another
average
fruit
beer
the
peaches
tasted
as
if
they
were
concentrated
and
a
big
caramel
dipped
peach
flavor
kept
coming
back
this
is
what
happens
when
you
try
to
get
cute
with
beer
i
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
stuff
heard
it
was
the
iconic
beer
of
rj
rockers
looked
great
smelled
great
everything
seemed
to
be
going
well
until
i
took
that
first
sip
then
im
not
sure
what
they
have
done
to
this
beer
the
peach
flavoring
must
come
from
the
peach
pit
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
peaches
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
bud
light
lime
is
much
better
im
just
thankful
i
didnt
buy
a
growler
of
it
o
passable
but
not
near
the
realm
of
good
wheat
beers
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
o
this
smelled
really
great
but
the
flavor
was
not
very
good
i
had
this
in
asheville
nc
at
the
thirsty
monk
south
happened
to
try
this
when
a
buddy
ordered
one
color
is
amberred
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
peaches
im
not
a
huge
peach
fan
but
this
beer
is
refreshingly
tasty
fruit
comes
through
well
and
is
just
sweet
enough
to
be
refreshing
without
being
cloying
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
unique
for
sure
a
very
simple
beer
not
much
going
for
it
im
not
much
for
mixing
beers
but
this
one
cries
out
to
be
cut
by
a
standard
pale
ale
or
a
wit
pours
a
pale
amber
with
a
thin
head
smells
of
unfiltered
peach
juice
heavy
on
the
skins
and
some
soapiness
the
taste
is
similar
starts
pretty
well
but
turns
a
bit
tannic
and
acrid
lacks
some
depth
o
a
very
peachy
ale
a
good
candidate
for
the
official
state
beer
of
sc
friend
of
mine
got
this
and
asked
me
to
taste
it
murky
orange
pour
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
fast
huge
peach
aroma
with
a
big
syruppy
peachy
taste
left
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
was
hard
to
shake
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
overall
both
my
friend
and
i
werent
big
fans
of
this
i
dont
like
to
give
bad
ratings
so
this
was
a
tough
decision
to
go
ahead
and
rate
it
at
all
rich
smooth
and
delicious
medium
effervescence
with
q
fuller
than
medium
body
peachy
aftertaste
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
drink
one
it
makes
a
great
dessert
o
i
was
expecting
a
overly
sweet
beer
but
am
pleasantly
surprised
how
drinkable
it
is
not
sure
if
i
could
have
a
ton
of
these
but
it
is
a
nice
summer
brew
and
above
average
for
a
fruit
beer
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
with
fresh
peach
notes
leading
the
way
but
it
fades
too
quickly
into
a
halfwaydecent
wheat
ale
with
a
slight
tinge
of
hoppiness
and
mineral
water
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
with
a
light
body
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
this
give
son
of
a
peach
a
try
if
you
happen
to
cross
paths
o
a
nice
beer
the
smell
and
flavor
do
a
nice
job
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
summers
day
worth
a
try
good
god
was
this
a
fantastic
and
enjoyable
summer
beer
fantastic
i
found
a
case
at
the
piggly
wiggly
off
of
kiawah
and
may
buy
another
to
take
back
to
pittsburgh
with
me
if
you
find
it
buy
it
o
this
is
an
incredibly
quaffable
session
beer
for
the
summertime
i
wish
it
had
more
dimension
to
it
like
some
tartness
or
hops
which
would
really
round
out
this
brew
cloudy
off
orange
pour
with
a
small
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
artificial
peach
aroma
artificial
peach
flavor
really
not
much
else
here
if
youre
gonna
make
a
peach
brew
at
least
make
it
taste
like
real
fresh
peaches
not
cheap
sticky
sweet
ones
as
you
may
have
guessed
didnt
think
too
much
of
this
one
sticky
sweet
finish
and
average
carbonation
cant
believe
this
is
their
most
popular
beer
the
girls
must
love
it
thats
probably
the
only
market
for
it
the
kind
of
girls
that
used
to
be
a
high
school
parties
with
wine
coolers
the
cpj
overall
this
is
an
average
to
below
average
wheat
beer
that
is
slammed
with
extract
its
one
of
the
reasons
many
beer
drinkers
are
not
big
fans
of
fruit
beers
overall
an
interesting
experience
and
something
i
grabbed
in
delaware
because
its
not
available
in
ny
o
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
it
is
quite
onedimensional
and
not
terribly
complex
definitely
worth
a
try
though
poured
a
hazy
orangehoney
color
with
a
good
amount
of
sediment
floating
around
thin
white
head
too
thin
strong
aroma
of
sweet
peaches
taste
is
mostly
of
peaches
as
well
but
from
a
can
the
kind
you
would
taste
with
all
the
syrup
there
are
some
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
which
combine
weirdly
with
the
peach
flavors
o
an
ok
beer
for
hot
weather
relief
they
definitely
hit
the
mark
for
a
peachtasting
beer
but
is
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
d
i
know
wheat
beers
dont
typically
rate
well
on
ba
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
i
typically
dont
like
peach
flavored
things
including
beer
but
this
is
done
pretty
well
and
is
crisp
and
refreshing
its
not
one
that
i
go
to
often
but
its
really
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
fruity
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
theyre
easy
to
put
down
and
fun
to
have
around
beer
is
super
thin
and
tastes
like
candy
has
been
dissolved
in
the
beer
this
worked
in
the
aroma
for
me
but
not
in
the
flavor
it
is
sweet
and
peachy
and
not
much
else
id
be
interested
if
this
was
sweetened
artificially
oh
well
o
overall
i
didnt
like
this
beer
it
has
a
peachy
smell
and
taste
which
is
nice
but
its
flat
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
and
will
not
buy
it
again
thanks
to
jpmclaug
for
setting
me
up
with
this
overall
its
refreshing
and
it
delivers
on
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
son
of
a
peach
beats
my
expectations
but
not
by
much
okay
this
is
what
i
dont
like
about
certain
fruit
beers
the
brewery
goes
overboard
it
becomes
a
liquid
candy
it
becomes
less
like
beer
and
more
like
an
orange
crush
or
something
this
one
is
a
peach
crush
though
its
a
wheat
appearance
cloudy
and
with
small
wheaty
particles
floating
the
smell
is
overpowering
peach
the
taste
is
the
same
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
good
carbonation
but
overall
if
you
like
peaches
chill
one
and
have
it
this
is
less
a
beer
and
more
like
a
mountain
dew
of
peach
beer
o
overall
not
bad
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
ours
a
slightlycloudy
peach
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
a
few
spots
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
peach
character
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
jolly
rancher
very
artificial
the
taste
is
the
same
way
except
it
tastes
like
artificial
sweetener
as
well
too
sweet
and
thats
in
a
bad
way
not
a
fan
at
all
despite
the
lowish
ratings
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
beer
and
dont
regret
trying
it
its
probably
a
good
beer
for
people
that
dont
drink
beer
sort
of
beer
but
not
as
much
for
regular
beer
drinkers
overall
a
little
onesided
in
complexity
with
peaches
dominating
every
sense
very
light
and
refreshing
though
and
a
nice
flavored
thirst
quencher
d
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
might
get
a
bit
too
sweet
after
a
while
but
i
still
think
this
is
very
impressive
for
a
fruit
beer
picked
up
a
6pack
it
was
pretty
pricey
so
i
figured
it
must
be
really
good
not
so
much
the
appearance
was
a
hazy
golden
wheat
color
the
aroma
was
of
peaches
okay
good
on
both
accounts
the
taste
bothered
me
it
was
a
sweetswill
i
get
that
it
is
a
fruit
beer
and
its
probably
my
own
fault
for
buying
it
but
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
more
peach
than
sugary
sucrose
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
overall
i
would
probably
tell
people
to
steer
clear
of
this
particular
beer
i
like
some
fruit
beers
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
for
me
okay
as
a
woman
i
was
told
that
i
had
to
had
to
buy
this
that
i
would
love
it
since
its
a
girly
beer
i
e
a
fruit
beer
well
let
me
dispel
the
myth
not
all
women
like
girly
beers
it
had
an
wheat
gold
appearance
with
head
when
poured
into
the
pint
glass
it
smelled
like
a
peach
but
im
not
sure
it
that
was
artificial
or
not
the
taste
was
average
for
a
wheat
beer
part
of
it
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
overall
it
was
average
also
had
a
friend
order
this
on
draft
recently
and
retasted
it
and
the
feeling
was
the
same
overall
very
drinkable
but
maybe
a
little
girly
finally
i
may
have
found
a
beer
my
wife
will
like
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
find
some
bottles
of
this
to
take
home
overall
i
love
most
fruit
beers
and
i
love
peaches
but
the
weird
aftertaste
hurts
this
beer
i
also
wish
the
peach
flavor
was
just
a
bit
less
but
peach
is
a
pretty
powerful
aroma
and
taste
definitely
interesting
and
worth
a
try
do
slightly
heavy
for
a
summer
beer
but
very
drinkable
this
manages
to
balance
the
beerfruit
thing
very
well
while
not
turning
into
a
flavored
malt
beverage
very
enjoyable
beer
for
summer
mix
half
and
half
son
of
a
peach
and
a
milk
stout
i
had
duck
rabbit
what
results
is
just
the
smoothest
maltiest
creamiest
peachy
mocha
flavor
highly
recommended
i
typically
do
not
enjoy
a
fruity
beer
but
another
patron
insisted
that
i
try
it
and
even
offered
to
pay
for
it
if
i
didnt
enjoy
it
d
very
drinkable
if
you
like
fruit
beers
and
in
particular
peaches
hv
mo
as
far
a
fruit
beers
go
this
one
is
pretty
good
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
looking
for
another
one
though
pours
hazy
orange
in
body
with
fading
white
foamy
head
sweet
aroma
of
peaches
and
fruit
juice
im
yearning
for
some
malt
or
hop
complexity
with
this
aroma
astringent
flavors
of
peaches
peach
skin
vanilla
extract
and
then
the
hops
id
hoped
for
in
the
aroma
make
an
unwelcomed
appearance
bitter
and
strange
then
the
drink
tries
to
finish
with
peach
syrup
but
its
too
much
of
a
turn
around
from
the
hops
lightmedium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
drink
with
no
direction
and
strange
acrid
flavors
d
the
peach
is
just
too
much
for
me
i
cant
take
a
whole
glass
of
it
overall
impression
a
refreshing
and
unique
take
on
the
style
easily
recommended
notes
i
do
like
peaches
a
lot
but
this
beer
is
straight
up
peaches
with
a
huge
sweetness
if
more
hops
and
malts
were
added
to
the
equation
this
would
be
a
much
better
example
good
but
not
balanced
enough
d
this
is
an
okay
wheat
ale
the
peach
isnt
overpowering
like
some
fruit
wheats
can
be
d
this
one
starts
out
strong
in
terms
of
appearance
and
smell
but
quickly
goes
down
hill
thereafter
this
one
seems
a
bit
forced
and
im
not
sure
i
would
accept
an
invitation
to
drink
this
again
in
the
future
i
didnt
really
like
this
at
first
but
it
has
grown
on
me
the
feel
is
certainly
decent
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
peach
flavor
but
this
isnt
too
bad
this
is
really
easy
drinking
despite
the
giant
sweetness
that
creeps
up
on
me
i
do
wish
this
had
a
little
tartness
to
it
to
cut
through
the
sweet
but
alas
i
guess
i
just
need
to
buy
some
more
festina
peche
f
finishes
semi
bitter
with
more
hops
attacking
grassy
and
earthy
hops
with
a
slight
floral
hop
flavor
most
of
the
hops
go
well
but
theres
a
slight
unpleasant
hop
bitterness
almost
like
hop
extract
that
doesnt
play
well
with
others
it
is
mostly
dry
at
this
point
as
well
but
has
a
slight
sticky
lingering
sweetness
like
the
syrup
from
canned
peaches
most
of
the
peach
flavor
is
gone
as
well
but
hints
of
remnants
that
i
just
chewed
on
peaches
but
without
skins
and
threads
stuck
in
my
teeth
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
and
the
peaches
are
all
up
in
your
grill
on
the
nose
but
more
subtle
and
juicy
on
the
taste
and
even
more
so
on
the
finish
so
the
nose
is
really
where
i
would
like
overpowered
peaches
and
def
not
on
the
flavor
so
they
hit
that
well
i
dont
necesarily
enjoy
peaches
but
this
is
not
over
the
top
or
under
the
radar
it
is
what
it
is
and
an
excellent
recipe
drinkability
a
fine
summer
brew
very
smooth
and
easy
to
knock
back
popular
with
all
but
the
the
most
diligent
of
fruit
beer
nazis
lol
d
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
in
the
midst
of
a
blazing
summer
day
its
refreshing
and
very
tasty
that
peach
looks
awfully
mean
still
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
almost
axactly
like
the
meat
of
the
colors
eponymous
fruit
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
peach
bestill
my
shocked
heart
wheat
whoa
now
more
surprises
and
a
nice
creamy
vanilla
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
rice
peach
skin
and
a
vanillaesque
cream
honestly
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
peachiness
but
at
least
they
didnt
go
overboard
i
guess
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
grainy
feel
one
of
the
better
fruity
wheats
ive
yet
had
drinkability
had
several
of
these
served
in
mason
jars
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
it
is
peach
season
here
d
ok
but
too
sweet
for
me
if
you
like
peaches
and
sweet
fruity
beers
you
might
like
this
one
wouldnt
really
look
to
try
again
medium
bodied
more
heft
than
i
would
have
guessed
low
carbonation
kind
of
slick
texture
great
summer
beer
some
good
flavor
and
a
very
easy
drinker
of
course
id
expect
no
less
from
a
beer
brewed
in
south
carolina
the
real
peach
state
suck
one
georgia
served
from
tap
into
a
standard
pint
poured
a
yelloworange
with
onefinger
white
head
that
reduces
and
stays
throughout
maintains
decent
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
one
is
dominated
by
peaches
the
flavor
starts
out
with
subtle
peach
with
some
grainy
notes
with
the
peaches
intensifying
upon
swallowing
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
from
the
rj
rockers
brewery
has
a
nice
peach
followup
that
is
quite
crisp
but
also
has
a
poor
flavor
up
front
it
is
not
horrible
but
i
am
not
a
fan
drinkability
is
pretty
low
for
me
if
youre
going
to
do
a
fruit
beer
do
it
right
see
new
glarus
this
is
a
mediocre
attempt
at
best
in
my
opinion
overall
other
than
the
overcarbonation
this
is
an
alright
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
the
peaches
make
it
especially
light
and
refreshing
though
it
lacks
some
of
the
toasty
rich
malts
i
have
seen
elsewhere
in
this
style
this
would
be
nice
with
lunch
on
a
hot
humid
day
in
the
south
the
billowy
head
was
quite
nice
as
well
and
worth
noting
im
not
sure
this
is
entirely
indicative
of
the
drinkability
but
after
finishing
the
bottle
i
found
myself
wanting
more
if
only
to
further
figure
out
what
the
heck
is
going
on
with
this
beer
with
all
honesty
i
can
say
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
it
i
really
cant
imagine
it
would
something
id
drink
frequently
but
id
like
to
give
it
another
shot
sometime
recommended
for
the
oddity
factor
alone
d
a
lightweight
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
id
return
to
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
ok
dont
think
id
purchase
it
again
unless
i
wanted
to
introduce
a
new
craft
fan
into
some
different
fruit
beers
mdtypical
hefe
or
wit
mouthfeelthin
and
spritzy
easy
going
insanely
drinkable
and
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
whose
closest
tolerance
for
fruit
beers
was
pumpkin
ale
fruit
beers
generally
piss
me
off
this
one
is
tasty
strong
summer
refresher
in
the
wheat
beer
category
kind
of
like
an
american
wit
rj
rockers
you
are
capable
of
making
good
beer
i
admit
it
pours
a
hazy
bright
orange
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
smells
strongly
of
peaches
which
is
a
good
thing
and
also
a
faint
aroma
of
wheat
just
enough
to
let
you
know
that
this
is
indeed
a
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
something
to
get
very
excited
about
the
peach
flavour
comes
through
very
strongly
without
at
all
being
offputting
after
a
few
minutes
pure
amazement
at
the
peach
my
head
returns
from
the
clouds
and
the
rest
of
the
taste
comes
through
with
a
lot
of
other
fruity
and
flowery
notes
the
aftertaste
is
a
very
sweet
peach
the
body
is
not
too
full
but
not
too
light
either
very
good
for
this
type
of
beer
the
allaround
greatness
of
this
will
keep
me
reaching
for
more
and
more
especially
during
the
sweltering
summer
heat
perhaps
my
favoite
beer
of
theirs
i
have
ever
had
this
was
just
sublime
at
times
a
great
great
beer
overall
i
was
so
impressed
i
had
a
second
very
drinkable
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
but
it
was
a
nice
walking
around
beer
at
the
fall
for
greenville
festival
drinks
pretty
easy
but
still
a
bit
too
fruitty
sweet
to
session
on
but
2
or
3
would
not
go
amiss
not
bad
it
is
fruity
and
it
does
have
relative
strength
so
that
makes
for
a
weird
type
of
drinkability
judgement
i
wish
theyd
make
both
a
more
powerful
and
a
more
subtle
versionsomehow
add
more
carbonation
with
less
ethanol
production
move
towards
festina
pesche
with
a
more
pungentpeachy
alcohol
bomb
move
toward
something
like
fort
or
the
upcoming
sweetwater
blue
balls
rj
rockers
has
something
here
and
they
should
roll
with
it
better
than
i
was
expecting
good
enough
to
give
it
a
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
by
a
sixer
of
this
unless
someone
asked
for
it
pours
a
cloudy
maize
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
amazingly
fresh
and
strong
peaches
yeast
and
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
low
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
tartnessacidity
associated
with
this
brew
tastes
of
peaches
up
front
and
throughout
tart
malt
yeast
slight
sweet
malt
and
very
slight
hop
overall
the
peaches
taste
really
fresh
and
strong
but
they
are
either
overpowering
the
other
beer
flavors
or
this
beer
lacks
complexity
is
this
a
good
beer
no
not
particularly
but
i
could
see
it
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
steamy
day
it
is
fruity
enough
to
hook
beer
novices
but
wellcrafted
enough
not
to
offend
the
more
experienced
drinkers
and
it
avoids
the
worst
offense
of
many
fruit
beers
and
that
is
to
taste
like
it
was
brewed
with
frozen
puree
or
artificial
flavors
taste
is
sharp
peach
extract
a
wheat
undercurrent
and
slightly
tangy
metalspice
flavors
average
mouthfeel
nice
for
a
fruit
beer
the
peach
and
wheat
go
well
together
the
drinkability
is
nice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hot
summer
beer
this
is
perhaps
a
gateway
beer
but
not
really
my
style
sometimes
i
buy
single
beers
just
to
have
funtaste
and
review
sometimes
i
am
upset
i
didnt
get
more
this
is
not
one
of
those
times
unless
its
the
only
beer
in
the
house
ill
never
have
this
one
again
creamy
mouthfeel
with
lower
carbonation
for
the
style
i
could
handle
mybe
two
of
these
but
the
sweet
peach
flavor
would
get
old
in
a
hurry
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
as
much
i
as
did
i
usually
approach
fruit
beers
with
a
certain
degree
of
trepidation
but
im
glad
to
report
that
this
one
worked
nicely
for
me
the
placement
of
the
peach
flavor
was
right
on
being
strong
in
the
aroma
but
then
being
more
balanced
in
the
taste
fresh
crisp
tasty
and
most
of
all
easy
drinking
this
is
a
great
summertime
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
that
could
satisfy
all
kinds
of
beer
drinkers
the
peach
is
authentic
without
being
too
candylike
id
reach
for
this
if
available
drinkability
very
good
for
this
wheat
beer
with
a
good
fruit
flavor
thrown
in
and
the
fruit
flavor
isnt
overwhelming
recommended
never
really
heard
of
a
peach
flavored
beer
that
wasnt
a
lambic
so
i
thought
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
it
pours
just
like
most
wheat
beers
light
golden
unfiltered
medium
head
on
it
but
what
got
me
was
the
smell
of
this
one
it
reeks
of
fresh
peaches
and
smells
of
peach
cobbler
it
was
pretty
impressive
and
very
nice
so
i
thought
that
drinking
it
would
be
way
too
overpowering
with
peach
flavors
but
it
was
actually
the
opposite
the
peach
flavor
wasnt
too
strong
and
had
just
enough
so
you
could
get
flavor
of
the
peaches
and
didnt
take
over
the
beers
flavor
overall
it
finished
very
light
and
easily
drinkable
it
is
a
good
spin
on
a
wheat
beer
with
a
good
flavor
profile
dont
know
if
ill
have
this
one
again
because
im
not
too
into
fruit
beers
but
if
you
are
then
this
one
i
would
say
is
a
must
try
the
low
alcohol
and
great
flavor
makes
this
fruit
wheat
beer
a
joy
to
drink
i
only
have
1
but
id
gladly
put
away
two
or
three
of
these
bad
boys
3
5
d
i
imagine
this
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
but
some
others
would
be
better
drinkability
i
was
reluctant
at
first
to
try
this
beer
ive
had
a
bad
time
with
fruit
driven
beers
in
the
past
this
pale
wheat
is
the
perfect
summer
refresher
i
highly
recommend
it
not
just
for
the
girlfriend
but
the
craft
beer
enthusiast
it
tastes
fresh
and
could
be
very
enjoyable
as
a
session
beer
for
the
witbierhefeweizen
drinkers
take
a
step
out
of
your
box
this
beers
a
crowd
pleaser
well
done
rj
rockers
another
tool
in
my
culinary
arsenal
drinkability
a
fine
fruitflavored
wheat
ale
for
a
pints
worth
particularly
if
youre
a
peach
aficionado
though
i
cant
help
but
hold
it
aloft
with
a
wink
and
declare
it
one
for
the
lahaha
ah
that
ding
with
only
7
reviews
currently
entered
hes
already
beaten
me
to
that
conclusion
well
i
still
stand
by
my
verdict
son
of
a
peach
is
one
for
the
ladies
which
now
that
i
think
about
it
isnt
a
halfbad
name
for
a
beer
to
begin
with
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
with
a
light
crisp
body
i
could
drink
this
on
a
hot
south
carolina
summer
day
without
a
problem
another
solid
offering
from
a
solid
brewer
finally
able
to
try
this
one
on
tap
and
was
very
excited
ive
reviewd
a
couple
rockers
brews
before
and
since
they
are
my
local
beer
i
may
be
a
little
biased
but
this
one
was
really
unique
it
has
a
cloudy
color
obviously
unfiltered
id
compare
its
appearance
to
an
apple
cider
which
was
cool
aroma
is
full
of
peaches
ive
tried
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
namely
blueberry
ales
that
smell
fake
but
lets
just
say
i
am
eagerly
anticipating
the
release
of
this
one
it
pours
a
cloudy
peach
color
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
peach
which
i
think
makes
it
seem
like
you
taste
more
peach
than
you
actually
do
not
sure
how
or
when
they
added
peaches
during
the
process
because
it
tastes
like
cough
syrup
so
sweet
hardly
beer
just
not
my
style
i
guess
phenomenal
fruit
beer
tastes
like
alcoholic
cherry
koolaid
this
beer
is
just
packed
with
cherries
from
reddish
hue
to
cherry
nose
and
tart
cherry
flavor
some
deep
malt
and
wood
flavors
in
the
background
this
screams
cough
syrup
its
a
beautiful
beer
but
too
medicinal
not
too
fruity
a
little
sour
or
tart
perfect
balance
really
enjoyed
this
easy
drinking
and
very
refreshing
i
have
one
or
two
of
these
a
year
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
really
tasty
enjoy
outdoors
with
friends
a
great
beer
at
the
near
pinnacle
of
the
style
it
leans
towards
the
onedimensional
but
there
is
just
enough
to
open
the
beer
up
to
make
it
a
real
worthy
beer
of
seeking
out
unexpectedly
fantastic
very
different
yet
great
too
sweet
the
cherry
flavor
overpowers
all
other
flavors
fantastic
sour
great
cherry
taste
cherry
pie
in
my
mouth
a
touch
sweeter
than
the
raspberry
tart
as
the
nice
malted
finish
is
a
bit
lost
however
the
beer
finishes
clean
and
dry
an
amazing
beer
that
tastes
like
sweet
cherries
the
taste
is
exceptional
but
i
am
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
a
glass
at
any
time
this
beer
is
a
cherry
bomb
through
and
through
it
is
absolutely
delicious
the
cherry
flavor
aroma
and
color
is
very
authentic
and
not
cough
syrupy
like
a
lot
of
commercial
cherry
beers
beer
is
not
very
sour
but
just
tart
enough
in
the
finish
to
give
the
impression
of
tart
cherries
i
have
never
had
a
beer
that
was
so
singular
in
flavor
profile
that
was
so
absolutely
delicious
this
brew
is
a
psalm
to
cherries
from
start
to
finish
the
dark
brownreddish
body
the
tanpinkish
head
and
the
blast
of
cherries
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
all
scream
ripe
red
juicy
cherries
it
also
achieved
an
impressive
body
and
mouthfeel
at
only
4
truly
delicious
total
4350
im
a
sucker
for
a
cherry
bomb
and
wbr
didnt
disappoint
straight
cherries
all
around
comparable
to
lindemans
but
a
little
less
sweet
and
more
full
body
if
you
like
a
lot
of
cherry
flavor
seek
it
out
went
to
new
glarus
brewery
a
few
years
ago
and
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
it
just
royally
sucks
that
we
cannot
get
it
here
in
oregon
it
is
the
best
tasting
cherry
beer
the
cherry
is
fresh
tart
yet
sweet
and
the
bubbles
are
amazing
it
is
a
beer
i
still
talk
about
to
this
day
very
worth
while
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
the
abv
they
stand
pretty
similar
in
quality
for
me
so
far
cheers
o
well
crafted
tons
of
flavor
and
aroma
hard
to
believe
this
is
just
4
0
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
not
my
usual
style
but
very
well
done
sweet
but
not
cloying
dry
enough
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
o
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
cherry
pie
in
a
glass
perfect
desert
beer
4
beautiful
garnet
clarity
indicative
of
the
fruit
from
which
it
was
made
reminds
me
of
red
wine
perhaps
a
red
zin
smells
of
tart
cherry
with
a
bit
of
candy
sweetness
not
at
all
reminiscent
of
flavoring
its
the
real
deal
flavor
is
as
good
as
you
could
expect
from
a
cherry
beer
tartness
wins
in
the
end
but
theres
a
great
sweetness
overall
this
is
perfect
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
finger
of
creamy
looking
white
head
smell
is
pure
cherry
a
malt
sweetness
is
lurking
in
the
background
but
its
hard
to
detect
anything
behind
the
huge
cherry
presence
the
taste
is
only
cherry
juice
im
not
sure
this
can
be
called
beer
i
could
drink
this
in
the
morning
with
my
toast
like
with
the
other
new
glarus
beers
of
this
ilk
im
finding
the
4
or
so
ounces
i
consumed
to
be
a
good
amount
the
sweetness
and
one
notedness
was
just
getting
to
me
by
the
end
still
an
absolute
killer
offering
really
disappointed
esp
after
how
much
i
love
raspberry
tart
and
serendipity
this
was
not
good
at
least
to
me
wife
thought
otherwise
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
4
55
o
much
like
the
rest
of
new
glarus
fruit
beer
lineup
i
am
blown
away
this
might
be
tied
with
the
deliciousness
that
is
serendipity
i
am
a
huge
sucker
for
cherries
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
am
so
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
really
good
beer
o
amazing
beer
slightly
better
than
serendipity
o
really
good
an
amazing
fruit
beer
not
something
you
drink
often
but
definitely
worth
savoring
when
you
do
o
an
incredible
fruit
beer
that
delivers
on
its
promise
the
cherries
are
definitely
the
focus
of
this
beer
as
opposed
to
a
beer
with
a
faint
cherry
character
very
nice
pours
a
hazy
ruby
red
with
a
thick
quickly
dissipating
red
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
lots
of
sweet
red
cherries
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
light
malt
on
the
palate
more
cherries
finishes
slightly
tart
light
bodied
with
effervescent
carbonation
overall
possibly
the
finest
example
of
a
fruit
beer
ive
yet
had
pours
a
cherry
red
color
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
is
full
of
fresh
ripe
cherries
exactly
amazing
to
just
breathe
this
beer
in
the
flavor
is
big
on
the
tart
delicious
cherries
doughy
malts
back
the
full
on
sweet
cherries
leaving
you
feeling
like
you
just
ingested
the
best
cherry
tart
in
liquid
form
this
is
exceptional
fruit
beer
medium
bodied
brew
with
soft
to
dry
cherries
overall
an
american
classic
made
with
care
in
small
batches
as
long
as
the
local
cherry
crops
allow
almost
impossible
to
find
outside
of
wisconsin
and
surrounding
areas
o
belgian
red
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
glarus
line
of
fruit
beer
this
is
great
on
a
hot
day
or
picnic
even
a
great
dessert
pairing
beer
nonetheless
this
beer
is
great
definitely
recommend
to
any
lambicfruit
lover
t
very
similar
to
the
smell
the
juicy
cherry
flavor
just
explodes
in
your
mouth
with
each
sip
red
apple
just
a
touch
of
oak
spice
theres
an
absolute
ton
of
cherry
sweetness
in
here
but
luckily
the
carbonation
is
on
point
and
keeps
this
from
getting
syrupy
a
definite
must
try
if
you
like
fruit
beers
amazing
stuff
overall
a
great
beer
for
after
a
meal
very
unique
and
a
wonderful
change
of
pace
o
this
is
a
very
unique
and
exciting
beer
i
absolutely
believe
every
beer
connoisseur
should
try
this
offering
in
fact
this
is
a
beer
that
people
who
hate
beer
will
enjoy
for
instance
my
wife
if
it
pleases
the
boss
that
says
a
lot
well
done
new
glarus
o
a
fantastic
beer
new
glarus
brews
amazing
fruit
beers
just
amazing
the
fact
that
i
can
go
get
some
solar
salt
at
walmart
and
grab
a
bottle
of
this
for
8
99
almost
makes
tolerating
wisconsins
shitty
winters
worth
the
trouble
almost
o
this
stuff
is
like
candy
loads
of
flavour
and
absolutely
delicious
i
wish
i
grabbed
more
of
this
stuff
because
it
really
is
phenomenal
o
judging
on
style
this
is
almost
perfect
thus
my
rating
sure
i
would
take
other
beers
before
this
but
this
is
top
notch
fruit
beers
thanks
aaron
the
finish
is
a
very
spicy
with
a
drybitter
bite
overall
very
sweet
too
much
so
taste
a
bit
too
much
like
a
kids
cherry
juice
not
as
impressive
as
raspberry
tart
overall
this
is
a
well
executed
fruit
beer
but
i
prefer
ngs
strawberry
rhubarb
to
this
that
said
it
is
better
than
the
raspberry
tart
all
of
ngs
fruit
beers
are
amazing
though
so
id
drink
any
of
them
gladly
olike
other
new
glarus
fruit
beers
it
is
much
more
sweet
than
sour
but
the
sweetness
is
not
artificial
at
all
o
pretty
nice
sweet
cherry
character
isnt
cloying
but
dominates
the
nose
and
palate
until
the
tartness
shows
up
on
the
finish
a
very
well
executed
cherry
beer
yet
more
tartness
would
have
been
awesome
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
again
the
brewery
created
a
fruit
beer
with
no
artificial
taste
it
has
enough
malt
in
the
back
to
let
you
know
its
a
beer
not
too
sweet
not
too
tart
a
great
dessert
brew
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
most
respects
but
just
isnt
my
thing
the
cherry
flavor
is
amazing
but
id
much
prefer
the
additional
depth
and
complexity
of
a
true
belgian
bottle
with
friends
nice
carbonation
and
warm
cherry
color
nose
is
of
a
big
red
wine
full
of
fruit
smoooth
stuff
rich
ripe
fruit
but
without
the
sugary
sweetness
lingers
on
and
on
dont
know
if
this
could
be
a
regular
consumption
but
id
like
to
try
overall
very
sweet
and
cherryforward
no
acidity
most
certainly
the
best
in
the
fruit
beer
style
and
one
of
wisconsins
best
beers
that
isnt
an
oneoff
looking
at
you
vsb
clearly
new
glarus
has
the
market
cornered
on
this
category
o
nice
beer
with
a
ton
of
cherry
flavor
the
bottle
says
there
is
a
pound
of
cherries
in
every
bottle
and
you
definitely
taste
it
i
know
its
a
cherry
beer
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
of
other
flavor
that
i
could
not
seem
to
find
still
a
very
good
drink
overall
the
best
fruit
beer
in
the
world
o
this
brewery
knows
how
to
make
fruit
beers
this
one
doesnt
dissipoint
jesus
this
is
glorious
still
my
favorite
new
glarus
lambic
of
them
all
the
cherry
flavor
is
bold
and
delicious
and
i
dont
really
like
cherries
that
much
which
says
a
lot
new
glarus
is
the
brewery
that
makes
me
exclaim
wow
every
time
i
try
one
of
their
fruit
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
would
love
to
see
such
a
beer
at
8
abv
as
a
strong
fruit
ale
o
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
is
not
only
one
of
the
greatest
cherry
beers
available
anywhere
its
also
one
of
the
most
quintessential
fruit
beers
on
the
planet
packed
to
the
brim
with
fresh
cherries
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
sublime
finishing
semisweet
with
a
perfect
level
of
tart
cherry
skin
acidity
overall
a
really
great
fruit
beer
one
of
the
best
american
takes
on
the
style
great
taste
of
real
fresh
cherries
overall
cannot
help
but
love
these
masterpieces
from
new
glarus
no
other
brewery
ive
had
can
bring
out
the
fruit
character
more
potently
and
perfectly
their
sweetness
is
always
kept
from
going
too
far
these
are
an
absolute
must
try
best
fruit
ale
i
have
had
o
i
will
admit
i
found
this
bottle
after
it
had
spent
at
least
a
year
in
my
cellar
shame
on
me
it
was
still
fantastic
now
i
need
to
find
another
to
try
it
fresh
im
sure
it
will
be
fantastic
o
the
cherry
flavor
and
aroma
are
so
vibrant
and
fresh
it
isnt
even
funny
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
infinitely
drinkable
maybe
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
overall
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
just
right
if
i
traded
this
raspberry
tart
and
serendipity
would
be
on
my
permanent
iso
list
i
could
drink
this
every
day
reviewed
61608
so
grease
back
your
locks
my
bros
and
get
yo
nails
did
my
girlies
and
hop
on
this
medium
cherry
amber
color
1
head
that
slowly
drops
away
strips
of
lace
like
the
best
krieks
starts
with
straw
and
malt
followed
by
real
tartsweet
cherry
taste
to
burst
in
quickly
and
smoothly
this
continues
blissfully
through
the
finish
surprising
taste
for
4
and
somehow
delivers
the
fruit
without
cloying
highly
recommended
bottle
from
brewmane
thanks
shared
with
beastmaster
pours
deep
opaque
ruby
red
with
cream
and
reddish
one
finger
head
huge
cherry
aroma
omfg
style
flavor
is
straight
up
jolly
rancher
cherry
then
more
cherry
bit
of
sour
and
mostly
sweet
light
mouthfeel
with
medium
heavy
carbonation
so
obvious
these
are
actual
fruit
and
not
some
flavored
syrup
over
the
top
cherry
and
very
good
fruit
beer
still
not
as
amazing
as
raspberry
tart
one
of
my
favorites
from
ng
this
is
definitely
a
cherry
bomb
while
not
mouthpuckering
this
beer
has
just
enough
cherry
tartness
to
be
considered
a
sour
drink
it
out
of
a
flute
and
admire
its
beauty
and
at
4
it
is
a
perfect
replacement
for
the
mimosa
at
the
breakfast
brunch
table
shared
this
with
the
neighbors
and
only
managed
about
a
four
ounce
pour
wish
i
could
have
had
more
than
that
it
tasted
like
cough
syrup
but
in
the
best
way
possible
like
a
bunch
of
those
really
good
ludens
cough
drops
melted
down
in
beer
form
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
smell
and
taste
were
borderline
perfection
will
have
to
try
this
beer
again
and
not
share
next
time
cherry
this
and
cherry
that
this
review
sounded
like
a
broken
record
im
sorry
but
this
beer
was
just
tart
cherries
and
nothing
more
no
malt
no
raspberry
no
hops
just
tart
cherries
this
was
an
extremely
easy
drinking
beer
the
abv
wont
sneak
up
on
you
it
was
hard
for
me
to
put
this
beer
down
i
wish
i
could
find
a
steady
supply
of
this
beer
big
thanks
to
my
good
ba
friend
meatyard
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
delicious
beer
a
perfectly
sweet
beer
to
have
for
desert
best
during
the
holiday
times
or
when
you
happen
to
enjoy
others
company
this
brew
is
perfect
for
sharing
with
those
who
love
wine
to
test
their
beerboundaries
and
bring
them
over
from
the
dark
side
with
beer
force
besides
the
quality
and
enjoyment
of
this
high
gravity
fruity
wonder
is
the
overall
look
of
elegance
and
class
with
this
beers
offering
of
a
champagne
style
container
with
dripping
red
wax
covering
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
capped
top
and
only
available
in
wisconsin
my
home
state
now
overall
a
terrific
american
take
on
the
belgian
kriek
style
not
quite
a
sour
as
a
belgian
kriek
might
be
but
attribute
that
to
the
lack
of
a
lambic
base
glad
i
got
around
to
this
before
they
ran
dry
in
wisconsin
but
sad
to
here
that
well
be
without
it
this
year
cheers
i
kinda
enjoyed
this
but
i
have
no
idea
how
to
rate
it
or
what
i
would
do
with
a
bottle
if
i
had
one
that
said
i
would
like
another
small
taste
to
give
it
a
fairer
shake
pours
a
brownish
red
color
fairly
cloudy
small
beigepink
head
this
beer
was
quite
sweet
and
tasted
like
concentrated
cherry
pie
filling
good
cherry
pie
filling
though
and
no
artificial
fruit
flavor
that
said
theres
a
strong
cough
syrup
flavor
in
there
too
the
feel
is
less
sticky
than
the
taste
would
suggest
but
it
was
still
a
bit
much
at
least
coming
to
the
beer
without
any
foreknowledge
little
to
no
oak
was
evident
this
is
a
beer
that
i
might
enjoy
a
lot
more
in
specific
circumstances
like
as
a
compliment
to
a
fancy
dessert
but
i
cant
say
that
i
loved
it
on
its
own
it
definitely
gets
an
entry
in
my
list
of
beers
to
revisit
a
really
nice
fruit
beer
new
glarus
really
can
do
no
wrong
in
this
category
unique
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
love
cherries
o
definitely
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
even
with
its
age
this
was
my
favorite
beer
i
had
on
christmas
especially
as
it
warmed
up
i
was
left
wanting
more
o
this
is
the
definition
of
a
fruit
beer
utterly
incredible
could
drink
at
least
one
a
week
divine
stuff
o
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
it
seems
more
like
a
dessert
than
a
beer
though
o
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
that
i
enjoyed
trying
probably
the
fruitiest
beer
that
ive
had
and
extremely
sweet
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
it
was
definitely
a
little
bit
too
syrupy
and
fruity
for
my
taste
if
you
like
really
fruity
beers
then
i
definitely
recommend
checking
this
out
review
from
notes
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
pinkish
head
smell
is
awesomely
cherry
like
a
cherry
pie
with
a
great
mix
of
both
sweet
and
tart
notes
taste
follows
the
nose
and
is
really
quite
excellent
the
cherry
pie
flavor
is
incredibly
well
done
and
its
got
a
bit
of
tartness
happening
here
too
the
beer
manages
to
be
sweet
without
being
overly
so
and
actually
is
rather
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
which
is
what
separates
this
from
most
other
fruit
beers
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
out
there
at
least
that
ive
ever
had
its
incredibly
well
made
and
is
much
more
complex
than
youd
expect
from
a
cherry
beer
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
beer
from
getting
a
higher
score
is
that
its
not
something
id
want
to
drink
with
any
sort
of
regularity
this
makes
for
an
excellent
dessert
pairing
beer
but
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
myself
just
sitting
around
and
drinking
a
glass
while
watching
a
football
game
750ml
red
wax
on
numerous
occassions
pours
a
bright
translucent
deep
pink
to
red
with
a
small
pink
creme
head
aroma
is
cherry
sucrets
cough
medicine
thankfully
moving
to
maraschino
cherries
and
clafoutischerry
pie
taste
is
sweet
black
cherries
cherry
pie
rich
and
viscous
with
a
major
spiced
note
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
palate
is
rich
creamy
dessert
like
not
oily
or
watery
its
not
the
show
stopper
that
ng
raspberry
tart
and
ng
apple
ale
are
but
it
is
evident
that
if
you
like
true
cherry
beer
and
arent
in
the
mood
for
kriek
this
is
the
ultimate
nonsour
cherry
fruit
beer
just
impossible
for
anyone
to
compete
with
new
glarus
in
the
fruit
beer
category
overall
an
outstanding
beer
very
fruity
nicelybalanced
and
guaranteed
to
put
a
smile
on
your
face
and
a
pucker
on
your
lips
it
probably
wont
appeal
to
all
beer
fans
but
i
thought
it
was
delicious
it
pours
a
dark
maroon
color
with
a
slightly
pink
bubbly
head
the
scent
is
rich
with
fermented
cherries
giving
it
a
very
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
rich
sweet
and
fruity
with
an
overall
great
cherry
flavor
its
smooth
refreshing
delicious
and
slightly
tart
one
of
new
glarus
signature
brews
that
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
one
the
market
definitely
something
you
have
to
try
o
this
is
very
good
it
seems
to
clearly
be
a
dessert
beer
and
not
a
drink
that
id
grab
out
of
the
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
but
at
the
right
time
in
the
right
mood
this
is
excellent
o
delicious
and
refreshing
tastes
like
real
cherries
not
like
a
lot
of
other
fruit
beers
which
are
syrupy
and
overly
fakely
sweet
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
could
easily
be
considered
a
gateway
craft
beer
for
some
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
red
was
a
murky
maroon
color
with
a
very
modest
offwhite
head
from
the
top
of
the
glass
one
can
detect
a
waxy
cherry
aroma
that
alomst
brings
to
mind
penny
candies
i
wonder
if
the
wax
top
of
the
bottle
affects
the
aroma
the
initial
taste
brings
a
tall
shot
of
tart
and
sour
cherry
the
best
qualities
of
a
cherry
the
taste
really
grabs
the
attention
of
the
sides
of
the
tongue
making
them
tingle
with
delight
a
backbone
of
a
biscuity
bread
allows
the
cherry
to
shine
while
still
having
a
subtle
quality
this
beligan
certainly
has
some
thickness
to
it
almost
like
a
beer
milkshake
mildly
fizzy
the
carbonation
and
the
thickness
allow
the
taste
to
linger
for
several
pleasant
minutes
a
sour
cherry
aftertaste
continues
the
fun
not
straying
much
from
the
initial
taste
however
i
find
the
aftertaste
slightly
more
sour
o
this
beer
is
a
cherry
bomb
all
the
way
it
surprised
me
that
the
cherry
profile
was
still
potent
even
after
i
sat
on
this
bottle
for
2
years
trip
out
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
again
if
you
like
cherriescherry
piecherry
cheesecake
give
it
a
whirl
it
wont
disappoint
yeah
i
dont
remember
liking
this
as
much
as
i
did
today
my
last
bottle
was
medicinal
yet
todays
sample
was
a
wellcrafted
example
of
craft
brewing
would
love
to
grab
another
bottle
preferably
unwaxed
arguably
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
it
pours
hazy
pinkish
pale
red
with
a
lovely
white
head
on
it
the
nose
is
sour
cherries
tart
and
a
little
sweet
with
some
funky
yeast
and
a
light
malt
body
my
friend
i
shared
this
with
took
one
whiff
and
declared
call
them
up
and
order
me
50
cases
he
hadnt
even
tasted
it
yet
positively
wisconsin
this
beer
says
to
me
with
a
cherry
taste
you
cant
get
from
washington
state
over
a
pound
per
bottle
it
says
and
i
believe
it
the
taste
is
puckey
from
the
cherries
almost
like
a
sour
beer
but
this
isnt
one
theres
also
some
other
fruit
esters
in
there
green
apple
and
pears
too
but
this
isnt
fruit
punch
there
some
bitter
hops
on
the
tail
end
and
a
rounding
cystal
and
pale
malt
body
underneath
it
all
the
carbonation
is
gloriously
bright
while
the
body
is
just
as
big
as
it
needs
to
be
i
am
in
awe
of
this
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ever
drinkable
and
interesting
but
unfortunately
unavailable
in
our
state
of
colorado
for
the
time
being
never
ever
pass
this
up
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
youll
be
blown
away
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
quick
fading
bubbly
head
that
leaves
some
lining
on
the
glass
smell
is
full
of
cherries
not
much
else
going
on
taste
is
full
of
cherries
as
well
very
sweet
but
delicious
mouthfeel
is
fully
carbonated
while
light
bodied
overall
this
is
delicious
pretty
cherry
forward
but
still
very
delicious
o
phenomenal
honestly
after
having
new
glaruss
offerings
on
fruit
beers
now
sure
ill
be
able
to
go
drink
any
others
buy
it
drink
it
enjoy
it
overall
one
of
my
longest
running
wants
and
it
did
not
disappoint
absolutely
delicious
overallthis
sets
the
new
bar
for
me
in
fruit
beers
i
love
the
depth
of
the
cherry
flavors
this
one
is
borderline
winelike
but
still
has
some
beer
flavor
the
fruit
seems
natural
and
not
in
any
way
artificial
when
i
am
back
in
wisconsin
next
year
i
will
bring
back
several
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
any
style
oamazing
amount
of
fruitiness
hard
to
believe
there
isnt
cherry
flavor
added
but
with
a
pound
of
cherries
in
every
bottle
i
guess
that
is
the
ticket
a
wonderfully
unique
delicious
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
bottle
from
a
friend
of
a
friend
who
was
going
to
wisconsin
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
dessert
in
a
glass
the
beer
pours
a
a
rusty
brown
maroon
with
tanred
head
that
fades
quickly
without
lacing
the
nose
is
very
bright
with
notes
of
cherries
plumb
cane
sugar
and
slush
puppie
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aromaa
huge
cherry
sweetness
that
sugarcoats
the
palate
followed
by
a
very
slight
tartness
to
keep
things
interesting
honestly
this
beer
tastes
and
feels
like
a
cherry
soda
not
nearly
as
attenuated
as
id
hoped
however
its
been
such
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
beer
like
this
that
its
still
enjoyable
i
dont
foresee
myself
getting
this
beer
again
but
its
still
a
great
beer
to
suck
down
on
a
hot
summer
evening
maintains
all
of
the
juicy
cherry
pie
sweettartness
in
the
flavor
as
well
in
fact
i
would
dare
say
that
oak
wood
shows
up
even
more
around
the
edges
in
the
flavor
than
on
the
nose
just
an
amazing
dessert
beer
especially
when
considering
how
it
never
gets
medicinal
or
cloying
at
all
despite
how
beefy
all
of
the
fruit
aspects
are
o
ive
throughly
enjoyed
both
the
raspberry
tart
and
now
belgian
red
from
new
glarus
fruit
beers
are
not
typically
a
style
i
enjoy
however
ng
has
succeeded
in
making
a
fruit
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
tartness
wisconsin
belgian
red
pours
a
very
nice
polished
ruby
red
with
gorgeous
cherry
highlights
a
little
more
than
two
fingers
of
bone
colored
foam
crown
the
beer
with
minimal
head
head
retention
and
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
has
a
huge
ripe
sweet
cherry
skin
aroma
with
just
a
bit
of
earthiness
behind
it
the
flavor
is
an
absolute
cherry
bomb
its
still
predominantly
sweet
but
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tart
cherry
edge
to
things
as
well
theres
a
slight
malty
sweetness
present
at
the
open
and
the
earthiness
comes
through
in
the
finish
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
though
with
a
little
more
heft
than
i
might
have
expected
for
a
4
beer
the
carbontion
while
on
the
bubbly
side
does
let
the
sweetness
mellow
for
a
second
or
two
before
really
kicking
in
wisconsin
red
is
outside
of
one
or
two
sours
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
fantastic
all
the
way
around
verdict
this
is
a
fantastic
fruit
beer
probably
the
best
fruit
based
beer
you
can
find
other
than
the
fruit
lambics
that
we
love
so
much
new
glarus
has
hit
a
home
run
with
this
and
almost
all
their
fruit
beers
hell
all
their
beers
are
dynamite
but
this
might
be
the
star
performer
of
their
line
9
a
750bomberish
lighter
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
smooth
yet
bubbly
on
the
tongue
this
is
easily
one
of
the
better
fruit
not
sour
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
o
overall
good
not
great
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
one
is
far
better
than
most
but
in
my
opinion
the
raspberry
tart
is
much
better
this
one
seems
much
more
artificial
and
generically
flavored
than
the
rt
which
literally
tastes
like
you
are
drinking
fresh
raspberries
certainly
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
o
if
you
have
access
to
this
pick
a
bottle
up
my
favorite
fruit
beer
period
d
not
quite
as
good
as
raspberry
tart
but
as
excellent
as
id
hoped
ruby
red
with
an
offwhite
head
some
retention
and
nice
lacing
nose
holds
loads
of
the
beautiful
wisconsin
cherries
dark
fruit
notes
spice
and
lots
of
jammypie
filling
characteristics
taste
of
cherry
pie
filling
spice
pie
crust
and
cherry
jams
dense
feel
full
and
just
an
immense
amount
of
flavour
packed
into
this
beer
another
brilliant
ng
fruit
beer
next
to
the
raspberry
tart
as
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
and
any
beer
ive
ever
had
wisconsin
cherries
are
fucking
boss
overall
i
actually
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
again
very
good
worth
trying
finally
got
my
hand
on
this
while
on
a
family
trip
to
milwaukee
22
ounce
bottle
sealed
in
red
wax
9
99
my
expectations
were
very
high
and
at
first
i
thought
they
were
met
however
after
the
third
sip
or
so
i
realized
how
overrated
it
was
worth
trying
for
sure
but
theres
great
fruit
beers
that
are
much
easier
to
find
o
i
prefer
raspberry
tart
over
this
raspberry
tart
is
more
refreshing
although
less
complex
but
ng
never
disappoints
world
class
beer
for
sure
o
not
really
impressed
with
this
but
i
thought
it
was
better
than
the
raspberry
tart
even
though
i
dont
like
cherry
flavor
too
much
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
fruit
beer
very
very
cherry
without
being
cloy
i
love
this
do
to
many
yeast
and
its
metabolites
are
what
distinguish
belgianstyled
beers
from
those
inspired
by
other
brewing
traditions
despite
being
called
belgian
this
fruit
beer
lacks
any
detectable
belgian
yeast
qualities
it
like
new
glarus
other
famous
fruit
beer
raspberry
tart
is
a
delivery
vehicle
for
fruit
qualities
this
beer
gains
an
advantage
over
its
sister
projecting
more
honest
cherry
that
the
other
was
able
to
do
for
raspberries
pair
with
dessert
and
women
m
medium
to
full
bodied
slightly
syrupy
with
a
low
carbonation
o
pretty
interesting
tastes
just
like
cherry
pie
but
i
could
barely
kill
my
8oz
pour
let
alone
a
whole
bottle
good
for
a
onetime
experience
o
this
was
by
far
the
best
fruit
or
vegetable
beer
have
had
i
can
see
why
people
go
nuts
over
this
stuff
but
its
a
bit
much
for
me
overall
impression
its
like
hearty
cherry
soda
its
like
a
good
shitty
port
without
all
that
pesky
alcohol
oprobably
the
best
fruit
beer
out
there
worth
seeking
out
and
is
perfect
for
warm
weather
o
so
complex
and
satisfying
and
easily
among
the
most
drinkable
fruit
beer
pairs
well
with
a
nice
creamy
wisconsin
cheese
flavor
is
sweet
candi
sugar
and
cherries
almost
like
a
ludens
cough
drop
nothing
but
sweet
fruit
and
a
bit
of
tartness
on
the
finish
no
booze
no
hops
anywhere
sticky
on
my
lips
and
sweet
but
still
fairly
good
drinker
next
time
i
will
split
the
750
though
o
extremely
drinkable
a
beautiful
treat
of
a
beer
thanks
yeahnatenelson
for
this
killer
treat
a
bit
all
over
the
place
and
a
bit
over
done
this
brew
is
a
bit
over
rated
imo
i
wont
seek
it
again
it
would
also
be
hard
for
me
to
recommend
i
much
prefer
raspberry
tart
thanks
nick
for
sharing
o
a
beer
for
the
style
and
for
just
being
a
delicious
brew
to
escape
to
occasionally
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
very
solid
fruit
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
blushing
monk
overall
i
recall
liking
this
quite
a
bit
when
ive
had
it
before
but
this
was
too
similar
to
cherry
cough
syrup
the
raspberry
tart
blew
it
away
its
also
gulpable
due
to
the
medium
slick
body
being
nicely
cut
by
the
carbonation
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
sessionable
if
you
can
get
it
and
is
probably
why
it
doesnt
come
off
as
a
cough
drop
delicious
brew
simple
yet
refreshing
and
well
crafted
very
nice
onot
an
overly
huge
admirer
of
the
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
very
smooth
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tired
hands
stemwine
glass
a
mostly
clear
cherry
red
color
tinted
brown
with
a
12
finger
puff
of
pinkishwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
wispy
layer
and
left
decorative
lacing
throughout
the
session
aroma
of
cherriesnaturallyand
distant
biscuity
malts
tasted
pretty
much
spot
on
like
cherry
pie
black
cherries
and
doughy
malts
good
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
with
the
sweetness
taking
a
slight
edge
and
the
breadiness
of
the
malt
keeping
everything
under
control
medium
body
slightly
chewy
moderate
carbonation
very
good
overall
sweet
and
vaguely
tart
its
like
a
chinotto
spritzer
but
with
pie
cherry
definitely
door
county
in
origin
straight
up
cherry
pie
crust
and
all
sweet
cherry
hard
candy
with
a
soda
spritzer
level
of
carbonation
at
the
riverside
brewery
this
used
to
be
aged
in
large
oak
foeders
not
sure
if
thats
still
the
case
as
it
doesnt
have
much
oak
character
at
all
mainly
an
apertif
with
cheese
or
paired
with
a
dense
chocolate
dessert
not
something
to
put
down
solo
really
more
of
a
crossover
for
wine
cooler
drinkers
thanks
hellomisterp
this
is
a
real
delicious
beer
this
brings
a
lot
of
great
cherry
flavors
and
does
it
great
awesome
in
your
face
cherry
smell
right
up
front
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
a
reddish
amber
color
head
dissipated
almost
immediately
to
just
a
ring
of
foam
taste
is
tart
cherries
up
front
with
a
sweet
finish
this
is
one
great
beer
that
left
me
wanting
more
a
very
tasty
beer
great
flavor
and
aroma
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
the
carbonation
giving
this
a
crisp
almost
champagnelike
quality
to
it
carbonation
is
not
antagonistic
which
is
pleasant
finish
is
quite
dry
this
is
such
a
great
beer
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
complexity
to
the
flavor
as
it
is
dominated
by
cherries
only
overall
drank
this
beer
many
time
just
finally
reviewed
it
i
really
love
this
fruit
beer
and
the
raspberry
tart
is
just
as
tasty
new
glarus
is
known
for
the
fruit
beers
for
a
reason
they
are
world
class
poured
into
a
champagne
glass
thick
cream
colored
foam
on
top
of
a
light
burgundy
red
beer
slowly
dissipates
to
a
ring
with
nice
lacing
smell
is
sweet
cherry
reminiscent
of
candy
taste
is
more
of
a
sweet
darker
cherry
not
very
complex
light
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
cherry
ale
not
overly
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
ive
not
found
anyone
that
doesnt
like
it
o
must
try
for
sweet
beer
lovers
cherry
lovers
and
highly
recommended
for
anyone
wanting
to
try
something
a
little
different
new
glarus
works
wonders
with
fruit
beer
as
displayed
by
this
fantastic
beer
bought
this
while
in
madison
poured
a
dark
red
color
with
a
off
white
head
aroma
heavy
of
cherries
this
beer
is
always
on
hand
at
my
house
perfect
for
dessert
and
great
for
people
looking
to
try
something
different
first
drink
was
very
sweet
very
delicious
fruit
beer
o
more
than
just
any
fruit
beer
very
rich
in
character
and
full
in
taste
would
be
great
after
dinner
or
for
the
holidays
this
is
the
perfect
fruit
beer
ranked
1
in
the
world
for
a
reason
o
i
wish
i
had
a
constant
supply
of
this
its
honestly
my
favorite
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
the
only
thing
close
to
this
was
smuttynoses
hanami
ale
which
was
discontinued
so
i
am
very
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
feel
that
taste
in
my
mouth
again
but
better
o
this
is
a
hard
one
to
rank
its
barely
beer
but
its
so
good
for
the
style
it
is
one
of
the
very
best
perhaps
even
the
best
overall
holy
hell
this
is
the
most
ridiculous
fruit
beer
ever
its
barely
beer
and
yet
its
everything
a
fruit
beer
should
be
thanks
to
crass3000
for
this
one
overall
its
not
hard
to
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
toprated
brews
from
new
glarus
theyve
most
definitely
hit
the
mark
for
providing
the
drinker
with
a
true
taste
of
cherries
at
their
finest
well
this
is
just
a
little
embarrassing
i
held
on
to
this
for
a
long
time
probably
longer
than
i
should
have
since
i
got
this
bad
boy
about
8
months
ago
and
who
knows
how
long
it
was
around
before
then
hoping
for
the
best
pours
a
very
hazy
red
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
drop
fast
the
smell
dear
god
that
smells
good
cherries
there
are
cherries
in
this
beer
lots
of
cherries
i
love
cherries
this
smells
very
good
it
also
tastes
like
theres
cherries
in
this
beer
it
does
a
great
job
of
balancing
the
sweet
and
the
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
and
the
drinkability
is
amazing
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
pop
this
one
this
is
seriously
a
worldclass
beer
if
you
like
cherries
you
will
like
this
beer
no
way
around
that
d
this
was
basically
onedimensional
which
was
somewhat
disappointing
to
me
it
had
a
terrific
natural
cherry
taste
but
nothing
else
it
must
be
sipped
since
its
so
sweet
this
could
go
well
with
vanilla
ice
cream
but
its
challenging
to
drink
a
full
glass
by
itself
nice
to
try
once
but
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
this
one
is
unique
i
very
much
enjoy
a
few
sips
but
the
drinkability
isnt
terribly
high
as
the
tartnesssweet
cherry
flavors
get
overpowering
by
the
end
of
the
glass
still
a
solid
beer
just
not
great
i
normally
like
fruit
beers
but
this
one
to
me
is
just
one
dimensional
and
starts
to
taste
like
cough
syrup
to
me
not
totally
digging
that
i
enjoyed
the
experience
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
the
beer
pours
an
interesting
dark
red
to
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
dominated
by
cherries
with
an
air
of
dryness
to
it
some
earthy
tones
linger
around
as
well
carbonated
and
light
on
the
palate
clean
cherry
sings
through
the
sweetness
is
beautifully
balanced
by
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
for
such
a
cherryladen
brew
complexity
abounds
it
has
wonderful
depth
and
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
owith
the
carbonation
in
this
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
cherry
soda
not
bad
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
fizzy
for
me
o
overall
this
is
a
really
impressive
brew
it
is
unique
and
a
great
representation
on
what
a
beer
can
be
and
still
be
great
shorts
should
take
note
these
guys
know
how
to
make
a
vegetable
beer
overall
a
glass
of
cherries
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
great
its
still
tough
to
rate
these
bizarre
beers
the
website
boasts
over
a
pound
of
door
county
cherries
in
every
bottle
but
packed
full
of
flavor

big
thanks
to
taturbo
for
this
beautiful
beer
the
beer
was
perfect
for
the
holiday
weekend
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
nice
looking
brownish
red
color
the
smell
was
of
fresh
cherry
juice
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
the
taste
was
wonderful
its
an
easy
drinker
although
i
find
myself
taking
small
sips
just
to
savor
the
epitome
of
world
class

5othis
is
definitely
more
complex
and
better
balanced
than
its
raspberry
brother
its
definitely
sweet
cant
think
of
a
negative
except
maybe
there
are
more
complex
beers
out
there
i
wish
they
made
a
sour
variant
of
this
may
28
2011
overall
i
wanted
to
like
this
more
it
is
pretty
tasty
except
for
the
slight
medicinal
notes
but
this
is
something
i
wouldnt
want
too
much
of
d
i
thought
the
raspberry
tart
was
good
this
is
better
amazing
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
this
again
o
most
fruit
beers
have
a
tinge
of
fruit
in
the
beer
but
this
fruit
beer
has
a
tinge
of
beer
in
the
fruit
it
tastes
incredibly
fresh
and
just
has
a
realness
to
it
it
feels
like
it
was
assembled
and
came
together
naturallynot
just
flavored
with
something
new
and
different
like
so
many
other
unique
beers
a
lot
of
great
beers
cant
really
be
appreciated
by
people
that
arent
beer
connoisseurs
but
this
sweet
crisp
lowabv
refreshing
beverage
could
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
absolutely
beautiful
brew
it
bears
repeating
new
glarus
could
teach
the
world
a
lot
about
fruit
beers
the
only
remaining
question
is
better
than
raspberry
tart
that
warrants
a
sidebyside
good
excuse
to
have
another
glass
of
each
excellent
just
awesome
all
around
every
drink
was
delicious
and
i
awaited
the
next
o
wont
find
a
fruit
beer
much
better
than
this
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
at
a
liquor
store
5
minutes
from
my
house
fortunate
to
be
in
wisconsin
where
it
is
available
a
good
brew
for
the
summer
months
i
see
myself
sitting
on
a
lawn
chair
in
the
sun
and
going
through
2
of
the
winestyle
bottles
myself
mild
unique
and
utterly
delicious
pours
a
murky
cranberry
juice
red
with
a
tiny
12
light
red
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
whatsoever
smells
of
fresh
sweet
cherries
in
their
own
juice
a
very
fresh
and
mouthwatering
smell
taste
is
very
much
like
the
liquid
form
of
a
cherry
flavored
jolly
rancher
very
sweet
yet
slightly
tart
at
the
same
time
in
a
perfect
balance
this
is
a
very
carbonated
beer
that
is
very
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
overall
an
awesome
fruit
beer
all
around
and
probably
the
best
cherry
flavored
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
will
seek
out
more
of
these
for
sure
first
off
this
should
be
a
soda
made
by
jones
i
cant
believe
something
this
tasty
is
a
beer
smell
of
cherries
fills
the
air
the
minute
you
open
this
bomber
tart
sour
and
sweet
taste
of
cherries
is
experienced
throughout
the
drinking
process
beer
may
be
too
sweet
to
have
more
then
one
bomber
but
when
the
taste
wears
out
you
crave
another
sip
to
satisfy
the
sweet
cherry
flavor
if
only
i
was
drinking
this
on
a
beautiful
summer
day
instead
of
cold
ass
chicago
winter
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
amazing
example
of
a
fruit
beer
it
smelled
good
and
tasted
good
as
well
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
cherries
i
would
stay
away
as
cherries
dominate
almost
all
aspects
of
the
beer
also
there
really
are
not
any
beer
like
qualities
to
it
but
if
you
want
a
good
fruit
beer
you
couldnt
go
wrong
with
this
one
d
really
drinkable
super
bold
flavors
that
just
feel
well
balanced
and
never
feel
out
of
control
the
fruit
flavor
is
excellent
in
this
beer
finish
is
really
nice
and
not
as
palate
blasting
as
expected
overall
a
nice
little
treat
that
doesnt
disappoint
saw
this
badboy
on
tap
and
had
to
have
it
as
the
bottle
i
had
before
was
quite
excellent
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
red
with
a
three
finger
very
light
pink
head
that
subsided
to
one
and
a
half
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
and
slight
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cherry
sugar
slight
tart
and
slight
sour
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
nothing
short
of
excellent
really
cant
believe
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
on
tap
it
was
really
just
as
good
as
out
of
the
bottle
everything
in
this
one
just
works
nothing
at
all
missing
for
the
style
and
is
likely
my
favorite
brew
of
the
style
only
compeating
with
raspberry
tart
if
you
havent
had
this
brew
before
regardless
of
the
serving
type
you
need
to
do
so
as
soon
as
you
possibly
can
d
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
special
and
unique
brew
desert
anyone
d
this
is
pretty
darn
tasty
if
youre
into
cherries
a
bit
hard
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
unless
you
really
love
cherries
very
good
stuff
try
it
at
least
o
this
beer
is
not
for
me
so
in
keeping
with
my
previous
methods
when
reviewing
a
beer
that
i
would
never
drink
again
i
am
rating
this
beer
as
straight
3s
hail
new
glarus
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
overall
more
likable
than
most
lindemans
but
theyre
more
similar
than
some
would
have
you
think
imo
incredible
this
is
pretty
much
the
holy
grail
of
fruit
beers
in
america
maybe
the
world
blows
away
any
other
beer
w
cherry
in
it
here
the
cherry
is
so
dominate
dont
even
think
of
trying
this
beer
unless
you
really
like
cherry
not
for
hophead
only
guy
you
cant
understand
the
cherry
dominance
in
this
but
again
the
nuances
of
everything
else
make
it
work
even
better
until
you
try
it
next
time
im
in
wisconsin
im
getting
like
10
of
these
hopefully
the
fruit
dont
fade
fresh
is
definitely
very
good
here
one
of
a
kind
brew
here
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
pinkish
foam
you
can
smell
this
is
bursting
with
cherries
the
minute
you
open
the
container
its
unlike
any
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
they
say
theres
a
pound
of
cherries
in
every
bottle
20
oz
bottle
and
i
dont
doubt
them
for
a
moment
this
beer
just
rushes
to
the
palate
its
quite
bubbly
but
that
works
wonderfuly
with
the
flavor
which
is
cherry
cherry
and
more
cherry
if
i
could
put
cherry
pie
in
liquid
form
this
is
what
id
come
up
with
simply
amazing
im
slightly
confused
about
the
difference
between
this
and
sparkling
cherry
juice
since
it
is
beer
it
seems
like
an
example
of
some
exceptional
brewing
skill
some
may
find
the
medicinal
character
to
be
objectionable
but
i
dont
750ml
bottle
courtesy
of
alpar
pours
hazy
red
juice
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
of
maraschino
cherries
taste
is
sweet
medium
bodied
with
a
luscious
ripe
fruit
finish
man
this
is
a
delicious
beer
thanks
for
sending
this
out
alex
awesome
stuff
this
is
the
holy
grail
of
fruit
beers
it
smelled
like
a
juicy
red
cherry
sweettart
with
a
twist
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
wheat
the
taste
was
a
direct
continuation
of
the
nose
tangy
candied
cherries
up
front
that
leave
you
with
a
little
pucker
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
with
a
mediumhigh
but
well
balanced
amount
of
carbonation
it
felt
mildly
creamy
and
had
a
somewhat
acidic
finish
i
ended
up
drinking
the
majority
of
the
bottle
and
didnt
grow
tired
of
it
through
4
smaller
glasses
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
9
110
aroma
is
very
sweet
loaded
with
cherries
and
some
softer
floral
notes
the
taste
is
similar
but
stronger
very
sweet
but
in
a
light
and
tart
way
with
a
bare
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
lip
smacking
good
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
scrub
the
sweetness
off
the
palate
or
it
could
be
the
temperature
of
the
beer
which
has
gotten
warmer
overall
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
poured
a
ruby
red
color
into
a
snifter
the
nose
was
overwhelmingly
cherries
but
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
was
the
same
but
with
the
slightest
tartness
just
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
i
could
have
easily
drunk
the
whole
bottle
but
was
glad
to
share
it
with
some
friends
thanks
levi
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
there
was
no
head
at
all
the
smell
is
very
sweet
strong
of
cherry
the
taste
was
very
carbonated
very
sweet
and
a
strong
cherry
falvor
just
a
small
bit
of
a
malty
taste
is
present
at
the
end
of
the
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
and
drinks
like
a
champange
overall
a
really
good
fruit
beer
different
and
it
will
only
be
liked
if
you
like
cherries
as
much
as
ive
gone
on
about
how
not
sweet
this
is
it
still
is
sweet
enough
that
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
bottle
that
being
said
this
is
phenomenal
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
love
me
some
cherry
beer
very
drinkable
for
such
an
intense
beer
easily
my
favorite
of
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
edit
after
having
this
a
few
times
the
thing
that
takes
it
a
notch
below
raspberry
tart
is
the
odd
cough
syrup
sharp
medicinal
aftertaste
that
occasionally
comes
in
i
dont
always
get
it
but
when
i
do
it
takes
me
aback
eliminate
that
and
this
would
be
in
the
tip
top
tier
rating
as
a
fruit
beer

drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
preferred
the
raspberry
tart
this
one
was
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
id
never
be
able
to
finish
a
bottle
by
myself
i
could
with
the
raspberry
5
minutes
in
and
im
sick
and
tired
of
the
syrupy
flavor
palate
is
flat
and
super
sticky
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
so
bad
but
in
the
end
three
of
us
ended
up
drinking
a
quarter
of
the
bottle
i
do
believe
it
will
make
great
ice
cream
sauce
d
absolutely
a
digestif
for
a
warm
afternoon
slowly
sip
while
reading
a
book
very
nice
d
drinkability
is
high
new
glarus
isnt
far
off
by
describing
this
as
the
marriage
between
beer
and
wine
and
maybe
fruit
juice
incredibly
easy
to
drink
without
having
the
cherries
dominate
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
special
occasions
but
probably
not
something
id
seek
out
for
everyday
drinking
this
is
such
an
easy
beer
to
drink
its
not
easy
for
me
to
obtain
and
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
it
every
night
and
thats
coming
from
someone
who
likes
things
on
the
sweet
side
of
things
a
delicious
beer
overall
though
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
best
nonsour
fruit
beer
i
have
had
to
date
absolutely
phenomenal
seek
this
stuff
out
hands
down
the
best
fruit
beer
that
ive
came
across
so
far
living
up
to
the
hype
i
really
cant
see
anything
wrong
with
it
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
too
so
im
scoring
this
one
very
high
pours
a
slightly
hazed
ruby
tinted
brown
color
nice
cap
of
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
scent
is
an
amazingly
bold
rush
of
tart
and
lightly
sweet
cherry
with
a
grahmn
crackery
malt
background
thats
about
it
and
thats
all
it
needs
to
be
taste
again
brings
the
cherry
tart
lightly
sour
and
lightly
sweet
and
the
faint
hint
of
grahmn
crackery
malt
provides
some
balance
medium
bodied
good
mid
to
high
carbonation
level
no
heavy
lingering
after
tastes
another
fantastic
beer
from
new
glarus
im
partial
to
raspberry
so
ill
give
that
one
a
nod
overall
but
they
are
both
the
best
fruit
beers
available
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
amazing
d
i
thought
the
raspberry
tart
was
good
this
is
better
amazing
beer
i
will
begin
to
demand
it
to
seal
the
deal
when
making
deals
with
guys
from
the
midwest
d
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
not
an
overpowering
taste
but
one
you
want
to
keep
tasting
gotta
find
more
krieks
poured
a
nice
deep
reddish
brown
not
much
head
but
very
bubbly
smells
heavy
of
cherries
very
good
smell
taste
is
just
as
heavy
with
the
cherries
nice
light
tastes
more
like
juice
than
beer
but
its
definitely
a
nice
taste
very
flavorful
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
i
probably
cant
drink
more
than
a
glass
at
a
time
overall
as
a
native
wisconsinite
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
is
in
nearly
every
grocery
store
ive
had
it
before
but
this
is
my
first
time
rating
it
the
appearance
is
really
great
deep
scarlet
almost
blood
red
the
taste
is
extremely
heavy
on
cherry
but
not
unpleasant
there
are
hints
although
faint
of
barley
and
the
smell
is
quite
nice
as
well
give
it
a
shot
for
its
uniqueness
drink
for
something
so
different
this
was
a
great
tasting
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
70
degree
so
cal
day
while
cleaning
the
house
looking
forward
to
that
raspberry
tart
i
traded
for
as
well
now
drink
is
surprisingly
well
for
all
the
craziness
of
this
beer
lots
of
bite
from
the
tingly
feel
and
acidic
bits
but
the
carbonation
and
sweetness
balance
that
and
the
tart
plus
sweet
candy
flavors
really
give
your
mouth
a
rollercoaster
ride
it
keeps
wanting
to
board
its
like
that
kid
who
gets
beat
up
on
teh
rollercoaster
but
as
soon
as
the
ride
ends
he
wants
back
on
i
can
barely
put
the
glass
down
to
type
a
sentence
before
i
need
to
take
the
next
sip
sessionable
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
truely
unique
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
without
question
d
extremely
drinkable
i
have
no
desire
to
share
the
rest
of
the
bottle
i
opened
with
anyone
yes
i
will
have
this
beer
again
d
overall
this
beer
is
very
tasty
it
never
becomes
cloying
it
never
burns
out
in
presenting
flavors
and
it
is
something
id
drink
again
probably
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
out
there
im
usually
not
the
biggest
fan
of
dessert
beers
but
this
is
delicious
and
extremely
quaffable
much
better
than
he
raspberry
tart
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
feel
very
clean
and
crisp
it
is
very
sweet
but
extremely
drinkable
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
had
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
outstanding
if
you
dont
like
cherries
or
sweet
beers
dont
even
bother
cherry
pie
in
a
glass
that
is
all
d
its
pretty
smooth
and
enjoyable
but
the
tartness
that
lingers
in
your
mouth
is
again
hurting
this
category
a
bit
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
few
ozs
at
a
time
too
sweet
to
be
considered
a
sessionable
beer
to
me
fruit
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
ng
does
this
nicely
in
an
unthreatening
way
i
wouldnt
have
another
by
myself
but
would
share
one
with
some
wine
loving
friends
nice
brew
very
big
on
sweet
cherry
flavors
and
a
very
nice
sipper
poured
a
gorgrous
dark
red
small
white
head
doesnt
last
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
aroma
is
huge
the
fresh
juicy
cherry
aroma
is
massive
perfect
level
of
tartness
more
so
than
the
raspberry
tart
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
light
tingle
from
the
carbonation
this
is
brilliant
super
juicy
drinkable
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
to
drink
it
myself
the
bottle
looks
great
with
its
red
wax
seal
over
the
cap
the
beer
pours
nice
with
a
decent
head
the
color
is
a
burnt
orange
red
i
would
opt
to
drink
this
over
many
desert
wines
it
is
not
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
want
to
drink
in
larger
quantities
i
was
surprised
how
strong
the
cherry
flavor
was
until
i
read
they
put
a
pound
of
cherries
in
every
bottle
honestly
i
would
have
liked
it
better
if
it
tasted
more
like
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
you
split
the
bottle
with
another
person
youre
in
good
shape
any
more
than
that
and
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
might
start
to
wear
on
you
drinkability
very
drinkable
like
drinking
juice
very
very
good
juice
thanks
to
zizzybalubba
for
this
one
pops
good
with
a
bit
of
bubbles
smell
is
cherry
candy
and
all
cherry
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
a
cherry
beer
thick
and
full
of
flavor
and
pretty
sweet
tates
like
a
kids
drink
or
something
like
that
very
different
beer
but
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
awesome
i
drank
the
bottle
and
was
wore
out
doing
so
i
think
the
first
glass
was
great
but
at
4
i
thought
i
would
be
able
to
do
this
on
my
own
the
last
glass
was
starting
to
get
to
me
but
the
first
glass
was
wonderful
drinkability
i
want
to
give
this
beer
a
5
the
flavors
are
so
mind
blowing
but
the
way
it
stings
my
mouth
i
will
deduct
5
this
beer
went
right
back
oback
on
my
want
list
d
it
felt
like
drinking
a
bowl
of
cherries
which
is
heaven
for
some
people
but
just
sort
of
cool
for
me
as
i
said
before
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
a
belgian
red
the
pink
head
is
cute
this
beer
pours
a
muddy
ruby
with
a
nice
3
inch
cap
that
disappears
into
just
a
thin
ring
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
head
lingers
and
leaves
decent
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
undiluted
organic
cherry
juice
no
added
sweeteners
no
preservatives
just
cherry
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
organic
cherry
fruit
roll
ups
concentrated
tartness
intermingled
with
cherry
sweetness
tasty
tasty
stuff
for
some
reason
i
also
pick
up
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
maybe
some
chocolate
malts
are
added
this
beer
is
utterly
fantastic
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
for
me
but
really
thats
a
little
thing
i
dont
know
if
this
is
the
best
american
fruit
beer
because
that
distinction
could
go
to
raspberry
tart
but
its
damn
close
d
this
stuff
is
great
i
dont
mind
having
extra
bottles
around
drinkability
is
good
a
bit
sweet
and
onedimensional
but
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
only
4
abv
definitely
seek
this
out
if
you
love
fruity
beers
andor
cherry
also
a
great
beer
for
those
that
arent
really
into
beer
d
i
dont
know
if
i
can
drink
a
single
750ml
in
a
single
sitting
but
it
makes
for
a
good
beer
to
share
with
friends
i
can
see
me
drinking
it
in
the
summer
by
the
pool
or
in
the
winter
next
to
the
fireplace
d
certainly
not
a
gulper
but
its
not
too
strong
to
declare
it
strictly
a
sipper
my
first
glass
i
finished
very
quickly
and
my
second
glass
i
nursed
a
bit
more
tasting
all
the
nuances
as
it
warmed
2
might
be
too
sugary
to
have
more
than
a
bottle
yourself
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
not
sure
my
stomach
would
agree
with
me
all
in
all
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
so
easy
to
drink
this
of
a
very
well
balanced
cherry
pie
definitely
try
this
once
if
you
like
fruit
beers
and
low
abv
brews
d
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
the
first
fruit
beer
ive
really
enjoyed
and
wished
i
had
a
second
bottle
easy
to
drink
and
amazing
flavor
d
i
appreciate
everything
that
they
were
going
for
but
it
is
still
a
bit
of
a
sipper
simple
and
kind
of
reminded
me
a
fruit
soda
still
it
is
well
executed
and
unique
d
overall
this
one
deserves
some
serious
credit
it
probably
is
the
best
fruit
beer
i
may
ever
enjoy
as
its
blown
away
its
predecessors
i
would
have
loved
to
crack
another
750
behind
this
one
but
unfortunately
i
only
picked
one
up
not
at
all
artificial
or
hard
to
put
down
as
i
find
most
fruit
beers
are
drinkability
a
m
a
z
i
n
g
love
love
love
d
incredibly
drinkable
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
raspberry
tart
so
i
got
these
for
my
wife
not
expecting
to
like
them
too
much
it
looks
like
ill
be
trading
for
some
more
of
these
in
the
near
future
o
tried
this
one
backtoback
with
founders
cerise
and
there
was
no
competition
this
represents
nearly
everything
you
could
hope
for
in
a
cherry
fruit
beer
this
is
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
hype
that
can
commands
a
premium
on
the
trade
forums
and
actually
deserves
it
it
deserves
at
least
one
shot
d
incredibly
drinkable
id
be
a
happy
camper
if
i
could
drink
several
glasses
of
this
edit
share
this
with
a
friend
or
two
i
made
the
mistake
of
opening
this
up
by
myself
about
half
way
through
it
feels
like
it
is
ripping
the
enamel
off
my
teeth
it
is
great
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
try
to
drink
this
bottle
alone
again
overall
a
fruit
beer
that
really
is
so
much
more
immensely
enjoyable
for
me
and
approachable
for
anyone
a
really
nice
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
after
having
this
numerous
times
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
poured
a
reddish
color
into
my
trusty
old
shaker
glass
yeah
i
shouldve
used
a
flute
but
what
the
hell
a
small
head
rises
quickly
and
disapates
nearly
as
fast
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
with
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
that
might
remind
someone
of
champagne
aromas
of
cherry
and
sweetness
on
the
palate
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
tart
cherry
this
is
a
delicious
brew
from
mr
carey
that
is
great
by
itself
or
mixing
it
with
a
good
stout
andor
porter
very
quaffable
im
going
to
easily
finish
the
bomber
and
will
actively
seek
out
another
but
its
not
exactly
sessionable
due
to
the
intense
fruit
flavor
i
really
do
like
this
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
but
does
not
compare
to
the
raspberry
tart
very
much
worth
a
try
however
taste
does
a
fruit
beer
as
well
as
ive
ever
had
its
medium
bodied
carbonated
feels
thick
extremely
drinkable
i
could
have
this
all
day
d
i
was
expecting
to
be
overwhelmed
with
an
overly
sweet
cherry
bomb
explosion
in
my
mouth
but
after
a
few
sips
i
found
myself
quite
pleased
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
beer
world
ive
grown
accustomed
to
i
think
i
may
explore
a
few
other
fruitysour
beers
in
the
future
thanks
to
my
girlfriend
for
sharing
her
bottle
the
taste
however
is
not
bad
heavy
heavy
on
the
cherries
with
a
nearly
cloying
sweetness
and
not
much
else
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
more
tolerable
the
cherries
become
more
lively
and
the
experience
much
more
pleasant
maybe
again
drink
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
new
glarus
other
major
fruit
beer
raspberry
tart
but
this
one
is
stupidgood
glorious
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
complex
while
still
allowing
the
cherries
to
lead
the
show
and
goodlooking
to
boot
handsdown
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
feel
that
i
would
get
sick
if
i
drank
this
too
fast
or
if
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
due
to
the
high
level
of
residual
sugar
and
the
carbonation
very
nice
overall
and
so
falls
the
last
of
the
mans
weekend
beer
acquisitions
it
pours
a
straight
cinnabar
topped
by
about
two
fingers
of
almost
pinkish
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
unsurprisingly
heavy
on
the
cherries
though
a
furtive
little
vein
of
medicinality
seeps
its
way
through
to
the
surface
the
taste
tones
down
the
medicine
and
ups
the
sweetness
a
notch
making
the
cherries
pop
all
the
more
fiercely
its
pretty
damn
good
baby
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
kinda
syrupy
feel
overall
an
extremely
drinkable
blast
o
fruity
goodness
get
some
the
appearance
is
a
nice
blood
red
color
with
the
slightest
of
pinks
adorning
the
head
on
the
surface
despite
the
cherries
on
the
label
the
initial
aroma
that
i
gathered
was
of
raspberries
and
fresh
ones
at
that
accompanying
the
aroma
is
the
sweet
smell
of
cherry
syrup
now
in
describing
the
taste
there
is
basically
a
red
fruit
salad
before
me
cherries
raspberries
and
hints
of
strawberry
to
boot
the
best
part
about
the
flavor
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
is
that
i
actually
can
taste
some
beer
maltiness
behind
it
thats
really
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
as
far
as
the
flavors
are
concerned
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
too
much
of
but
its
really
a
very
solid
fruit
beer
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
said
genre
of
brew
d
i
cant
think
of
any
other
beer
in
their
arsenal
that
encapsulates
ngs
attention
to
detail
and
exemplifies
their
desire
for
high
quality
i
constantly
remind
myself
that
the
beer
contains
no
wild
yeast
just
plain
old
awesome
oldfashioned
brewing
gotta
love
it
for
that
like
a
great
dessert
this
is
best
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
after
about
4
ounces
i
have
had
my
fill
and
the
beer
begins
to
become
cloying
d
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
not
too
sweet
like
i
thought
it
would
be
and
quite
a
nice
refreshing
beer
to
have
would
go
great
with
desserts
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
in
the
us
to
date
yet
still
very
approachable
and
drinkable
excellent
balance
of
sweetness
to
tartness
its
a
beer
worth
driving
to
wisconsin
for
or
at
least
finding
a
friend
to
ship
you
some
a
mild
yogurt
cheddar
cheese
with
tart
apples
sounds
like
a
great
pairing
d
was
excited
to
try
this
but
somewhat
let
down
a
darkish
cherry
7up
mixed
with
some
childrens
cherry
cough
syrup
would
be
an
apt
comparison
hopefully
this
review
with
its
high
rdev
and
low
score
on
a
high
rated
beer
wont
get
deleted
d
high
just
really
solid
and
a
low
abv
drinkability
is
no
good
on
this
one
maybe
if
i
was
a
child
drooling
for
candy
but
after
a
while
this
makes
one
sick
ill
revisit
this
again
sometime
but
its
not
too
appealing
to
me
as
of
now
d
so
drinkable
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
d
goes
down
ridiculously
easy
not
too
filling
mild
kick
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
could
have
again
and
again
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
out
there
number
1
there
are
some
poorlyexecuted
cherry
beers
out
there
and
this
trumps
them
im
glad
this
is
a
pretty
regular
ng
offering
but
perhaps
its
rank
is
just
a
bit
highbut
only
a
bit
cheers
and
new
glarus
this
one
is
a
staple
o
very
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
i
could
see
it
as
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
but
it
would
definitely
have
to
be
split
among
the
entire
table
dark
cherry
russet
brown
with
a
creamy
pink
tinted
tan
head
that
settles
slow
and
leaves
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
stunning
big
cherries
and
not
artificial
cough
syrupy
cherry
either
more
like
a
freshly
baked
cherry
pie
with
mildly
toasted
oak
velvety
smooth
tart
cherry
flavors
with
a
soft
caramelized
oakiness
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
seltzery
carbonation
finishes
sticky
this
is
really
nice
proof
that
great
beer
can
be
under
5
abv
this
is
the
same
beer
as
raspberry
tart
only
with
cherries
they
have
similar
malt
profiles
and
similar
levels
of
spices
if
you
like
one
then
you
will
like
the
other
and
trust
me
you
will
like
one
this
stuff
is
phenomenal
one
of
alltime
big
wants
since
i
started
on
ba
and
no
disappointment
here
i
could
drink
this
everyday
and
be
happy
so
good
pours
a
murky
dark
red
very
small
pinkish
head
smells
like
cherries
i
should
say
like
real
cherries
wow
taste
is
cherries
tart
cherries
kind
of
like
a
homemade
cherry
pie
very
very
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
exceptional
on
this
one
this
beer
lives
up
to
all
of
its
hype
my
girlfriend
and
i
got
done
this
bottle
and
just
sat
there
sad
that
we
couldnt
just
go
and
buy
another
one
i
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
and
try
pairing
it
up
with
some
desserts
and
maybe
some
entrees
seek
this
beer
out
d
nice
cherry
flavor
what
a
fantastic
brew
however
i
think
i
liked
the
raspberry
tart
a
bit
better
this
has
a
slight
artificial
taste
but
its
still
good
definitely
would
have
this
as
a
constant
in
the
fridge
if
it
were
readily
available
i
pretty
much
got
the
same
taste
as
i
did
smell
it
was
like
cherry
pie
all
the
way
through
with
a
nice
sweet
taste
to
it
not
a
fizzy
carbonation
or
anything
like
that
either
just
a
very
fruity
beer
d
its
only
flaw
is
in
its
simplicity
the
ulltimate
cherry
pie
beer
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
thick
light
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
red
amber
aroma
is
malt
sour
cherries
and
spice
flavors
exactly
like
nose
body
is
perfect
and
carbonation
is
the
ultimate
and
cuts
through
the
flavors
exactly
right
finish
is
fairly
long
and
exquisite
not
a
session
for
me
but
a
great
beer
for
desert
or
on
a
picnic
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
hued
color
with
a
slight
red
head
that
pillows
to
the
top
of
the
glass
honestly
the
aroma
is
strong
smell
of
cherry
fruit
punch
when
you
drink
this
i
think
it
would
be
totally
possible
to
not
really
know
it
is
beer
ever
so
slight
tart
beginning
that
transitions
to
a
full
boddied
cherry
flavor
very
clean
tasting
lightmedium
mouthfeel
you
do
not
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
just
outstanding
full
of
fruit
flavors
and
alcoholic
mmm
d
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
cherry
beer
and
youve
had
this
before
there
probably
isnt
a
suitable
substitute
its
truly
one
of
a
kind
low
enough
abv
to
be
sessionable
but
im
not
sure
how
much
i
could
have
before
needing
a
change
of
pace
db
this
and
the
raspberry
tart
give
me
a
reason
to
go
to
wisconsin
some
time
absolutely
awesome
beers
amazing
flavor
with
a
great
sweet
to
tart
balance
a
eyeopening
experience
quite
drinkable
with
a
lively
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
style
my
only
gripe
is
that
i
find
myself
half
way
through
the
experience
drinking
it
faster
just
because
it
starts
to
get
a
bit
too
acidic
and
agitate
the
back
of
my
throat
cheers
very
drinkable
but
definitely
not
as
much
as
raspberry
tart
crazy
carbonation
kind
of
hindered
it
for
me
not
sure
which
one
i
liked
more
the
flavors
for
this
one
had
a
bit
more
complexity
which
i
dug
what
can
i
say
another
amazing
fruithardtobelieveitsbeer
from
new
glarus
dthis
is
just
tasty
it
isnt
complex
or
adventurous
its
just
tons
of
delicious
cherries
with
a
light
to
even
moderate
amount
of
sourness
with
a
great
feel
to
it
and
enough
malt
body
to
give
it
some
balance
md
normally
i
would
say
you
couldnt
drink
more
then
one
or
two
of
these
throughout
the
course
of
a
night
not
this
one
it
has
a
nice
rich
body
with
perfect
carbonation
i
really
want
to
drive
the
four
hours
to
wisconsin
to
buy
this
again
right
now
for
my
first
beer
from
new
glarus
i
would
have
to
start
the
slow
clap
and
build
up
to
a
thunderous
roar
you
dont
feel
like
you
are
drinking
beer
but
get
rid
of
those
preconceived
notions
and
this
is
an
absolute
treat
highly
recommended
d
this
stuff
goes
down
so
incredibly
well
i
never
would
have
expected
so
much
aroma
and
flavor
from
a
lower
alcohol
beer
perfect
for
hot
summer
weather
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
biggest
treats
i
have
experienced
all
year
d
for
a
5
beer
its
not
crazy
drinkable
compared
to
others
but
this
is
just
different
from
others
it
will
take
me
a
minute
to
kill
the
bottle
but
i
opened
it
on
a
hot
day
and
was
in
the
mood
for
this
so
the
beer
is
just
what
i
wanted
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
big
fruit
then
you
wont
like
it
had
this
when
i
was
in
wisconsin
man
this
beer
was
a
eye
opener
smell
great
with
the
tart
cherries
and
the
drink
was
smooth
as
wine
the
taste
was
great
not
what
i
aspected
from
a
beer
but
it
was
great
they
are
on
there
game
new
glarus
have
fans
out
on
the
east
coast
wish
they
could
at
least
shipped
to
pa
flavor
is
tasty
very
sweet
high
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
flavor
is
mostly
cherry
and
not
much
else
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
even
though
its
not
your
every
day
beer
its
a
great
alternative
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
similar
to
a
fruity
champaigne
nice
fruit
beer
d
really
easy
to
drink
this
beer
wife
had
a
few
sips
but
i
finished
the
bottle
very
easily
very
refreshing
and
mouthwatering
highly
reccomend
iso
more
amazing
beer
i
would
enjoy
frequently
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
track
this
down
and
drink
it
now
you
will
not
regret
it
d
this
is
a
good
beer
definitley
a
sipper
im
gona
have
no
problem
finishing
this
one
on
my
own
glad
i
got
another
one
in
the
cellar
waiting
for
me
d
refreshing
and
delicious
having
an
entire
bottle
to
yourself
proves
to
be
a
bit
too
much
but
it
is
great
to
share
with
friends
d
the
flavor
of
this
is
just
outstanding
new
glarus
is
very
quickly
becoming
one
if
not
my
favorite
brewery
everything
i
have
from
them
is
really
good
definitely
dont
pass
this
up
if
you
get
a
chance
for
8
99
for
a
750
it
is
just
an
absolute
steal
too
very
good
though
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
d
low
in
abv
and
enticing
flavor
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
good
choice
for
a
celebratory
beer
with
friends
this
is
a
drinkable
fruit
beer
its
sweeter
than
a
lambic
but
much
smoother
if
you
dont
love
cherries
youll
probably
not
like
it
but
if
you
are
a
cherry
lover
this
will
be
quite
a
treat
it
goes
well
with
chocolate
or
any
cherry
dessert
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
superb
dessert
i
could
have
one
every
night
if
i
could
afford
it
and
it
was
actually
available
in
pa
i
think
this
might
be
better
than
the
raspberry
tart
pours
a
lovely
reddish
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
cherries
taste
is
the
same
but
insanely
intense
and
potent
with
some
additional
tartness
coming
through
very
bubble
and
lively
as
you
sip
this
is
a
delicious
and
unique
beer
would
definitely
drink
this
again
yum
mfd
an
intensely
fruity
beer
with
the
smoothest
carbonation
possible
considering
how
much
it
has
not
a
fruit
beer
kind
of
guy
but
i
could
practically
be
content
with
a
case
of
this
for
the
night
drinkability
for
fruit
beers
quite
so
for
normal
drinking
not
so
much
granted
i
would
not
drink
this
just
for
the
hell
of
it
this
is
a
very
tasty
desert
beer
or
just
a
beer
to
enjoy
around
the
holidays
i
have
another
one
of
these
coming
via
a
trade
and
look
forward
to
pairing
it
with
some
dark
chocolate
andor
brownies
a
very
good
beer
if
you
havent
had
this
get
on
it
new
glarus
is
my
life
oh
yes
tart
cherry
juice
your
hired
all
others
need
not
apply
the
tartness
matching
with
the
sweetness
is
what
makes
this
beer
as
amazing
as
it
is
that
and
the
dry
and
fine
tight
carbination
playing
around
i
wish
i
could
say
more
about
something
other
then
cherries
but
i
cant
and
really
there
is
no
need
to
have
anything
else
in
this
beer
love
this
beer
cant
wait
until
we
meet
again
drinkability
the
flavor
is
onedimensional
but
so
perfectly
captures
the
flavor
of
ripe
cherries
that
it
is
easily
overlooked
drinks
easy
but
i
probably
couldnt
do
a
whole
bottle
this
is
a
worthy
beer
for
one
who
loves
cherries
i
was
quite
surprised
at
this
beer
surprised
and
disappointed
normally
i
am
a
fan
of
all
things
new
glarus
but
this
beer
was
just
too
damn
fruity
it
smells
like
cherries
it
tastes
like
cherries
its
cherry
red
i
mean
i
like
cherries
and
all
but
this
stuff
is
like
cough
syrup
i
wanted
some
beer
with
my
fruit
salad
one
glass
was
enough
one
bottle
was
far
too
much
for
a
brewery
that
ordinarily
makes
such
wellbalanced
beers
this
cherry
thing
has
gotten
a
little
out
of
hand
if
i
wanted
juice
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
beer
the
aroma
is
strongly
cherry
and
not
much
else
on
the
tongue
the
cherry
flavor
is
backed
up
by
a
bit
of
a
grain
taste
the
body
was
very
effervescent
and
crisp
sweet
without
being
sticky
drinkability
will
depend
on
how
you
like
sweet
and
fruity
brews
i
loved
it
and
would
lots
more
if
it
were
available
to
me
i
dont
know
if
its
possible
to
improve
upon
a
beer
like
this
absolutely
delicious
i
wish
id
brought
another
back
from
wi
after
my
last
trip
kudos
to
new
glarus
drinkability
this
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
normally
think
about
sessioning
but
it
has
such
a
great
balance
of
sweet
and
mostly
tart
cherry
flavor
that
this
could
be
a
surprise
addition
to
my
regular
stash
this
will
be
a
staple
of
our
future
tastings
with
the
neighbors
edit
on
110912
have
had
this
many
times
over
the
years
most
recently
last
weekend
on
110212
possibly
my
favorite
fruit
beer
ever
this
beer
is
amazing
i
fear
this
one
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
i
was
especially
let
down
because
i
had
just
had
new
glaruss
unplugged
cranbic
the
night
before
which
really
impressed
me
so
i
had
especially
high
expectations
md
medium
to
fuller
body
lots
of
zippy
small
carbonation
a
very
rich
fruit
beer
drinkability
is
hard
to
rate
for
this
one
its
easy
to
drink
more
like
a
pop
than
a
beer
but
i
couldnt
do
much
of
this
split
a
750
and
that
is
plenty
good
overall
d
great
beer
and
representation
of
the
style
poured
at
a
recent
ba
tasting
event
someone
said
that
these
ng
beers
are
what
you
give
to
people
who
say
they
dont
like
beer
as
a
way
to
convert
them
and
i
can
easily
see
that
this
pours
a
hazy
auburn
and
smells
overwhelmingly
like
maraschino
cherries
the
taste
is
like
drinking
a
cherry
dumdum
pop
very
sweet
light
on
the
tongue
but
the
sweetness
for
me
was
overwhelming
and
i
didnt
want
any
more
than
about
2oz
of
it
warrant
would
love
this
beer
i
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
2
snifters
it
pours
a
fizzy
quava
color
with
lots
of
white
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
pure
cherries
at
first
the
cherry
flavor
is
a
bit
much
and
overly
sweet
but
by
the
second
sip
the
cherry
flavor
really
comes
through
making
it
very
refreshing
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
light
in
body
and
very
wine
like
for
me
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
had
imo
a
must
try
for
any
ba
d
in
short
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
at
all
i
drank
one
lambic
glass
full
and
gave
the
rest
awaywhich
is
easy
because
this
is
a
very
popular
beer
to
me
it
gave
the
impression
of
cough
syrup
without
the
medicinal
aspect
which
would
have
been
an
improvement
imo
i
really
respect
that
this
beer
is
all
cherry
without
being
artificial
which
is
why
i
am
trying
not
to
slam
it
too
much
but
this
brew
is
just
not
for
me
bottle
pours
a
hazy
reddishcranberry
color
with
a
small
frothy
offwhitepink
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
cherries
mostly
with
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
flavor
is
sour
cherries
a
hint
of
oak
and
some
winegrape
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
sour
and
a
fairly
active
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
overall
thoughts
are
i
cant
believe
i
passed
this
bottle
up
so
many
times
i
will
be
in
wi
again
this
week
and
will
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
another
bottle
this
may
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
right
person
great
alternative
to
someone
who
likes
wine
coolers
i
really
doubt
there
is
any
alcohol
in
this
beer
but
new
glarus
insists
there
is
i
feel
kinda
stupid
enjoying
this
juice
box
so
much
but
it
is
great
a
nice
after
meal
treat
5
0
d
i
need
more
of
these
fruit
twins
this
is
the
perfect
dessert
beer
for
both
beer
aficianados
and
bmc
guzzlers
alike
im
both
sad
and
disgusted
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
left
a
near
perfect
fruit
beer
for
my
tastes
in
most
every
regard
aroma
and
flavor
are
dominated
by
rich
complex
and
completely
natural
fresh
cherries
thick
syrupy
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
long
lasting
sour
and
tart
cherry
finish
appearance
is
murky
thick
rust
and
blood
color
with
a
large
cream
colored
head
with
a
light
rosy
tint
long
lasting
retention
and
thick
rings
of
web
like
lacing
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
all
5s
for
me
is
that
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
tart
to
sweet
cherry
flavor
but
its
a
minor
concern
this
beer
poured
a
lovely
hazy
deep
ruby
red
with
a
white
cap
that
had
the
slightest
pink
in
it
the
body
is
a
shade
darker
than
the
cranbic
lots
of
cherries
bing
and
maraschino
type
and
a
hint
of
apples
the
flavor
is
so
similar
to
the
aroma
that
the
only
difference
is
that
i
discern
a
touch
more
tartness
in
it
overall
very
sweet
smooth
texture
light
and
bubbly
a
great
drinker
all
around
d
great
stuff
it
was
enjoyed
by
all
all
parties
agreed
that
this
brew
would
be
best
for
either
a
hot
day
or
a
brunch
it
was
really
great
for
what
it
was
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
goblet
of
this
in
one
sitting
whereas
i
happily
drank
the
entire
bottle
of
raspberry
tart
in
a
short
amount
of
time
but
it
is
not
a
total
loser
it
is
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
fruitbeer
afterall
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
samuel
smiths
organic
cherry
it
pours
a
dark
red
and
smells
like
cherry
of
course
the
taste
is
great
sweet
like
cherry
but
not
too
sweet
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
who
likes
fruit
beers
samuel
smiths
cherry
or
new
glarus
beers
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
amazing
but
not
like
typical
beers
there
were
definitely
moments
where
i
just
wanted
to
tip
the
glass
back
and
chug
so
be
careful
and
refrain
from
doing
so
d
this
was
good
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
to
be
honest
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
table
wine
very
sweet
and
appealing
to
drink
in
small
doses
after
i
was
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
however
id
had
enough
it
just
got
a
little
too
sweet
after
a
while
i
wouldnt
drink
750
ml
of
fruit
juice
and
thats
basically
what
this
tastes
like
despite
this
its
still
a
very
respectable
fruit
beer
the
red
raspberry
is
much
better
imo
overall
a
great
cherry
inspired
fruit
beer
can
lean
a
little
towards
sweet
at
the
end
of
your
glass
but
it
never
struck
me
as
an
artificial
fruitiness
give
it
a
shot
overall
i
really
loved
this
beer
but
i
absolutely
love
cherries
cherries
are
probably
my
favorite
fruit
and
this
beer
really
tastes
like
real
cherries
instead
of
the
fake
extract
in
a
lot
of
cherry
beers
d
i
could
drink
this
for
days
md
medium
carbonation
and
body
the
taste
lingers
with
you
and
gives
you
time
to
think
about
it
for
a
minute
or
longer
after
having
it
one
of
two
perfect
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
need
more
wisconsin
belgian
red
d
very
drinkable
could
session
this
all
day
but
for
the
limited
distribution
however
just
because
you
could
doesnt
mean
you
should
bright
ruby
red
in
color
looks
like
a
red
wine
with
a
soft
pick
head
while
shortlived
has
lots
of
body
and
texture
smells
like
youre
walking
through
a
cherry
orchard
no
malts
hops
ect
none
needed
the
cherries
do
the
job
i
could
sit
here
and
smell
this
beer
all
day
flavor
follows
the
aroma
cheeries
not
cough
drop
cherry
flavoring
real
fresh
cherries
with
all
of
the
sweetness
and
tartness
that
cheeries
have
mouthfeel
is
on
the
full
side
of
medium
with
great
carbonation
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
session
beer
but
it
sure
is
easy
to
get
this
one
down
thanks
brewcrew
i
love
this
beer
first
you
have
to
consider
the
elegant
packaging
the
green
750ml
bottle
the
red
wax
even
the
label
is
classy
then
you
pour
aroma
is
a
blast
of
fresh
pie
cherries
and
the
color
a
hazy
beautiful
dark
pinkred
complete
with
a
light
pink
head
which
fades
quickly
taste
is
a
refreshing
sweettart
complex
sour
acetic
cherry
flavor
not
for
amateurs
my
friend
and
girlfriend
didnt
really
care
for
it
and
they
gave
me
theirs
she
said
the
tartness
and
carbonation
reminded
her
of
the
inside
of
zots
candy
more
for
me
just
one
drop
of
this
beer
is
loaded
with
flavors
pours
pinkred
and
slightly
hazy
fizzy
champagne
bubbles
aroma
is
amazing

wow
flavors

abound
finishes
tart

flavors
bitterness
is
low
this
is
all
about
the
fruit
i
could
drink
bottle
after
bottle
of
this
stuff
the
low

makes
this
extremely
accessible
splendid
beer
i
could
have
this
and
the
raspberry
tart
for
any
celebration
great
job
ng
overall
not
the
most
balanced
beer
to
say
the
least
but
again
the
flavor
profile
is
out
of
this
world
i
highly
recommend
acquiring
a
bottle
or
two
man
am
i
glad
my
girlfriend
brought
me
back
two
of
these
bad
boys
cheers
this
was
worth
the
wait
and
will
be
worth
the
effort
to
track
down
another
md
the
feel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
slick
syrupy
feel
left
behind
the
strong
sweetness
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
notch
and
i
certainly
wish
i
had
one
or
two
people
to
share
it
with
i
would
still
take
raspberry
tart
over
this
one
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
had
now
i
may
have
to
try
the
raspberry
brew
its
less
like
beer
and
more
like
cherry
soda
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
have
had
it
multiple
times
and
it
always
delivers
it
is
just
so
amazing
this
is
a
beer
i
love
to
have
access
to
very
drinkable
and
it
packs
a
huge
fresh
flavor
i
had
this
beer
to
celebrate
my
brother
moving
into
his
new
house
and
i
was
anticipating
this
to
be
the
greatest
beer
ever
when
i
saw
the
beer
it
wasnt
the
most
impressive
beer
i
have
ever
seen
but
i
felt
that
when
you
make
a
cherry
beer
it
would
look
like
this
in
that
aspect
the
brewer
had
gotten
exactley
what
they
wanted
the
smell
was
wonderful
when
you
are
making
a
cherry
beer
you
should
smell
cherrys
and
nothing
but
that
is
exactly
what
i
smelled
the
taste
hit
me
as
medicinal
i
dont
like
to
ever
speak
bad
of
beers
but
i
could
not
shake
the
fact
that
it
tasted
like
cough
medicine
the
mouthfeel
was
an
exception
to
the
taste
the
beer
seemed
to
be
perfectly
carbonated
and
didnt
give
me
any
reason
to
review
it
as
bad
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
not
good
for
me
i
emphasize
for
me
because
i
know
that
there
are
people
that
could
drink
this
like
crazy
but
i
am
more
of
a
beer
guy
and
never
drink
wine
i
feel
bad
to
ever
give
out
a
bad
review
but
to
me
this
beer
was
like
a
fine
painting
that
would
never
look
good
in
my
house
but
i
can
thoroughly
appreciate
the
effort
and
time
put
into
it
d
like
juice
this
is
so
appealing
to
me
that
i
could
drink
it
for
breakfast
just
tart
enough
that
the
sweetness
does
not
dominate
at
makes
this
the
perfect
fruit
beer
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
some
fruit
infused
lambics
ive
tried
would
be
interested
in
trying
this
beer
side
by
side
with
lindemans
cherry
lambic
however
the
intensity
of
flavor
in
this
beer
really
impressed
me
and
sets
it
apart
from
most
belgian
fruit
lambics
ive
tried
good
stuff
an
excellent
brew
and
a
definite
must
try
the
beer
pours
a
rosy
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
outstanding
it
has
a
killer
cherry
scent
thats
so
tart
and
refreshing
i
love
sour
cherries
in
beer
this
is
very
much
like
the
aroma
of
lindemans
kriek
the
taste
is
perfect
it
captures
the
essence
of
what
a
fruit
beer
can
and
should
be
its
bold
and
refreshing
with
tons
of
tart
fruit
character
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
as
well
its
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
and
their
raspberry
tart
are
by
leaps
and
bounds
the
best
fruit
beers
on
the
planet
i
only
wish
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
my
hands
on
them
thanks
to
tim
and
mary
anderson
for
the
opportunity
to
try
these
d
each
sip
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
this
beer
is
expertly
balanced
between
sweet
and
tart
and
is
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
tried
the
abv
is
undetectable
and
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
d
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
have
more
than
a
glass
of
this
becaus
it
does
get
to
be
a
little
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
i
typically
like
my
fruit
beers
to
be
sour
d
very
enjoyable
but
certainly
only
one
in
a
sitting
and
it
should
be
shared
i
will
certainly
be
enjoying
more
of
these
in
the
future
pours
reddishorange
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
unmistakable
lots
of
sugar
cherries
and
something
that
reminds
me
of
red
wine
the
flavor
is
more
cherries
with
a
ton
of
sweetness
this
tastes
like
cherry
filling
inside
of
a
fried
pie
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
carbonation
is
mediumlow
easily
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
sampled
get
this
one
and
make
yourself
popular
pours
a
brilliant
bright
red
color
with
a
couple
fingers
of
pink
colored
head
that
dissolves
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
this
beer
actually
does
have
a
cherry
like
appearance
fantastic
the
aroma
is
strictly
tart
fresh
cherries
the
flavor
is
the
same
straight
up
cherry
juice
with
a
little
lambic
flair
its
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
prickly
amount
of
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
the
simplicity
of
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
what
makes
this
an
amazing
beer
another
topnotch
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
wow
what
a
sweet
syrupy
beer
if
you
want
to
know
what
this
taste
like
get
a
hostess
cherry
fruit
pie
and
eat
the
filling
puree
inside
of
it
and
well
you
get
the
picture
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
desert
beer
and
would
be
awesome
for
any
after
dinner
treat
worth
the
effort
recommend
we
preferred
this
beer
over
the
raspberry
tart
which
seemed
a
bit
dryer
when
swallowing
feel
and
drinkability
spritzy
and
fine
carbonation
almost
like
it
burns
it
attacks
the
palate
and
fills
the
mouth
in
a
most
pleasing
way
but
not
like
soda
and
yet
it
doesnt
interfere
with
the
beers
flavor
body
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
expected
medium
in
body
going
toward
heavy
very
champagne
like
this
is
one
that
id
regularly
celebrate
with
if
only
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
drinkability
not
excellent
for
me
anyway
too
sweet
to
really
be
consumer
en
masse
but
not
bad
either
paired
with
the
right
dessert
im
sure
its
exquisite
and
with
the
right
lady
im
sure
its
even
more
so
an
experience
for
sure
and
worth
trying
a
shining
beacon
for
fruit
beers
in
an
sea
of
otherwise
extractladen
crap
i
dont
know
how
they
do
these
but
the
beer
world
would
be
a
better
place
if
more
people
knew
d
fuller
bodied
than
most
other
fruit
beers
which
really
works
here
a
bit
more
complex
and
the
silkiness
ties
all
the
flavors
together
deserving
of
the
hype
in
its
style
a
great
beer
one
that
i
hope
to
have
again
new
glarus
definitely
has
their
ducks
in
a
row
when
it
comes
to
these
fruity
tart
beers
great
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
great
fruit
beer
its
nice
to
have
a
pure
fruit
beer
and
not
a
beer
with
fruit
a
little
drier
and
more
carbonation
and
this
would
be
perfect
drinkability
fruit
beers
are
for
me
generally
a
fairly
unimpressive
category
new
glarus
does
these
right
though
really
captures
the
essence
of
the
fruit
d
i
found
this
beer
impressive
though
ive
got
to
admit
i
think
it
takes
more
like
fermented
cherry
juice
than
it
does
like
beer
being
sweet
and
loaded
with
cherry
flavor
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
very
easy
drinker
however
being
sweet
and
loaded
with
cherry
flavor
i
dont
think
ill
be
making
this
a
regular
beer
anytime
soon
move
along
this
isnt
the
fruitcherry
beer
youre
looking
for
im
certainly
surprised
at
the
ratings
around
these
parts
overall
its
kind
of
onedimensional
cherry
but
i
liked
this
a
lot
drinkability
is
good
the
brew
is
pleasant
and
drinkable
the
only
complaint
here
is
that
it
could
be
less
sweet
and
a
bit
more
acidic
or
tart
oh
well
i
feel
their
raspberry
tart
is
a
much
better
fruit
beer
than
this
one
im
really
impressed
with
this
one
i
poured
it
out
and
i
could
already
smell
the
fresh
cherries
it
looks
like
a
belgian
dubbel
but
with
a
bit
more
burgundy
color
to
itdecent
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
wisps
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
aroma
is
outrageousstraight
fresh
cherries
it
tastes
pretty
amazing
too
with
big
sweet
and
tart
cherry
flavors
followed
by
a
spicy
wheatmalt
backbone
with
some
cinnamon
spice
it
tastes
almost
exactly
like
cherry
pie
a
fantastic
cherry
beer
here
medium
mouthfeel
creamy
carbonation
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
definitely
tough
to
move
through
the
whole
bomber
but
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
after
a
meal
fantastic
the
aroma
is
full
of
ripe
sweet
cherries
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
flavor
is
absolutely
full
of
cherry
flavor
perfectly
balanced
with
a
wonderful
maltwheat
backbone
that
makes
it
taste
like
a
fresh
cherry
pie
including
subtle
spices
that
remind
you
of
cinnamon
and
sugar
sprinkled
on
top
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
know
its
hard
to
make
but
keep
it
up
dan
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
easily
despite
the
sweetness
great
after
dinner
beer
d
way
to
sweet
for
me
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
split
this
one
with
a
few
others
got
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
last
summer
thanks
to
a
beer
trade
friend
the
colour
was
cloudy
and
amber
with
a
temporarily
thick
head
the
aroma
was
cherries
cherries
and
more
cherries
on
the
palate
it
was
like
getting
a
cherry
pie
in
the
face
and
thoroughly
enjoying
it
loads
of
pie
cherry
flavour
and
even
pie
crust
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
baking
sugar
what
a
nice
beer
d
refreshing
and
delicious
the
kind
of
beer
my
momor
anyone
who
doesnt
like
beer
would
and
should
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
its
very
drinkable
despite
how
sweet
it
is
da
good
special
occasioned
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
as
an
after
dinner
treat
d
this
is
one
of
most
easy
drinking
beers
ive
had
even
with
the
sweetness
whenever
i
take
a
drink
i
just
want
to
keep
drinking
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
but
not
my
style
i
would
like
to
try
it
with
ice
cream
or
other
dessert
i
think
people
who
appreciate
fruit
beers
would
definitely
enjoy
this
one
because
its
just
so
overloaded
in
sweet
cherry
its
just
not
something
that
should
be
enjoyed
more
than
as
a
dessert
beer
as
i
was
left
to
enjoy
the
entire
bomber
by
myself
d
a
good
beer
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
thankfully
impressive
flavors
considering
the
low
abv
i
could
really
see
this
one
working
well
as
a
dessert
or
coupled
with
dessert
but
its
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
overall
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
fruit
beer
can
and
should
be
new
glarus
has
many
beers
worth
making
the
hourlong
trip
from
my
home
to
wisconsin
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
them
d
could
drink
over
and
over
fantastic
d
drank
the
whole
25
oz
bottle
wanted
more
easy
to
drink
fantastic
the
pour
is
quite
gorgeous
hazy
and
turbid
ruby
red
with
a
large
dense
off
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
pure
cherry
juice
fresh
and
refreshing
with
a
delicious
blend
of
tartness
and
sweetness
mildly
jammy
this
is
glorious
the
palate
is
similar
with
sweet
cherries
rich
and
pure
mild
tartness
is
present
and
the
acidity
and
funk
are
very
restrained
almost
nonexistent
for
a
beer
thats
supposed
to
have
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
the
finish
is
a
touch
disappointing
with
the
sweetness
fizzling
out
rather
rapidly
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
treat
but
my
8oz
were
sufficient
i
would
never
turn
this
down
though
d
a
really
great
and
tasty
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
the
whole
750ml
though
as
it
is
very
sweet
pours
a
very
hazy
red
color
and
i
mean
red
not
amber
but
like
ripe
cherries
or
pomegranates
the
head
is
thin
and
fizzy
with
loose
bubbles
white
colored
kind
of
fades
fast
and
only
leaves
tiny
bits
of
lacing
looks
pretty
normal
for
a
fruit
beer
but
not
extremely
exiting
the
smell
is
just
full
of
ripe
cherries
there
a
not
unsurprising
tartness
probably
both
from
the
fruit
and
the
yeast
but
the
fruit
is
incredibly
dominant
which
is
what
is
supposed
to
happen
here
the
smell
isnt
like
candied
cherries
or
like
cough
syrup
well
maybe
only
a
little
bit
but
the
cherries
smell
amazing
when
you
taste
it
you
can
kind
of
sense
the
beer
in
this
slightly
bready
with
a
little
bit
of
pale
grainy
sweetness
but
still
the
cherries
are
allowed
to
shine
and
enhanced
by
the
yeast
profile
the
cherries
come
out
first
like
the
tart
orangeyellow
cherries
rainier
cherries
i
think
then
it
becomes
like
a
darker
deep
red
fully
ripe
sweet
cherry
like
bing
cherries
then
it
takes
on
an
aspect
of
black
cherry
cola
with
a
rush
of
carbonation
and
finishes
with
a
yeasty
tartness
still
mingled
with
some
cherry
sweetness
really
a
nice
fruit
profile
on
this
the
body
on
this
is
nice
and
light
and
crisp
but
the
fruit
actually
makes
it
feel
a
little
more
full
but
the
crisp
bite
of
carbonation
keeps
it
in
check
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
depth
of
fruit
is
very
interesting
a
bit
slowing
but
not
cloying
and
at
barely
over
5
you
could
stick
with
this
for
quite
a
bit
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
a
great
dessert
or
apertif
beer
that
would
even
please
and
surprise
those
nonbeer
drinkers
that
you
know
fruit
beers
dont
get
much
better
than
this
one
you
can
tell
that
this
is
a
truly
artisinal
beer
that
goes
above
and
beyond
the
usual
fruit
flavoring
added
to
these
types
of
beers
this
is
one
that
would
please
most
crowds
d
could
drink
this
all
the
time
plus
i
would
choose
this
over
wine
every
time
this
beer
is
deserving
of
all
the
praise
that
it
gets
d
very
high
i
could
easily
finish
a
big
bottle
of
this
d
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
i
could
drink
this
forever
if
it
wasnt
so
rare
new
glarus
took
the
time
and
fermented
real
cherries
and
it
shows
in
the
taste
theres
just
no
substitute
for
the
real
thing
with
all
the
artificial
flavour
out
there
in
the
fruit
beers
today
youve
got
to
look
to
new
glarus
for
the
best
if
i
ever
get
to
wisconsin
im
buying
a
case
of
this
stuff
and
ive
never
bought
a
case
of
anything
in
my
life
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
forever
and
it
did
not
disappoint
wow
d
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
alcohol
level
is
low
and
its
presence
is
undetectable
while
drinking
it
very
much
like
cherry
champagne
this
would
go
great
with
any
kind
of
dark
chocolate
based
dessert
its
a
great
fruit
beer
if
a
bit
sweet
750
from
the
last
wisco
voyage
acidic
right
off
the
bat
very
tart
cherry
nice
sweet
malts
uncovered
with
no
hop
presence
bready
tastes
as
well
not
as
thin
as
i
was
expecting
which
adds
a
really
nice
texture
to
this
beer
very
easy
drink
with
slight
wine
characteristics
very
acidic
again
on
the
end
this
was
an
easy
drink
and
to
all
you
young
cats
out
there
trying
to
get
your
groove
on
with
some
honey
pop
one
of
these
and
let
the
night
begin
hv
75cl
bottle
thanks
to
photomike
for
bringing
both
this
and
the
raspberry
tart
to
the
august
sc
tasting
this
is
another
great
fruit
beer
by
ng
but
im
afraid
it
suffered
a
little
bit
being
tasted
along
side
raspberry
tart
which
is
hands
down
the
most
amazing
fruit
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
maybe
its
just
my
preference
for
raspberries
though
because
the
beers
were
almost
the
same
except
for
the
fruit
flavor
red
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
just
a
surge
of
cherry
pie
almost
leaning
toward
maraschino
cherries
in
a
fake
way
but
managing
to
tiptoe
the
line
and
come
across
a
little
more
like
piefilling
the
flavor
is
pure
cherry
pie
with
a
light
tartness
and
surprising
and
welcomed
lack
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
aroma
doesnt
burst
with
quite
the
amazingness
of
raspberry
tart
but
this
was
quite
good
in
its
own
right
bottle
pours
dark
red
color
with
a
head
that
looks
tan
colored
aroma
is
cherry
candy
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
cherry
and
not
much
else
this
reminds
me
of
a
cherry
candy
i
used
to
eat
when
i
was
a
kid
thats
what
the
flavor
is
to
me
overall
its
what
i
expected
it
to
be
stuffed
with
great
cherry
character
i
enjoyed
this
ive
found
it
pairs
well
with
good
dark
chocolate
d
highly
drinkable
as
i
can
down
sweet
beers
but
this
one
could
be
too
sweet
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
has
good
flavor
and
not
really
any
alcohol
flavor
as
i
contemplate
drinking
more
than
a
share
of
a
bottle
i
lean
towards
thinking
that
the
sweetness
was
a
little
too
much
i
would
struggle
to
finish
a
bottle
by
myself
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
tart
perhaps
a
little
more
dimension
that
said
this
is
a
phenomenal
worldclass
beer
that
i
am
making
a
point
to
get
more
of
especially
because
it
is
wife
approved
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
all
harmoniously
welded
the
balance
between
sour
and
sweet
is
incredible
each
receptor
in
your
tounge
is
overwhelmed
with
flavor
once
you
start
to
quaff
this
elixer
its
hard
to
stop
the
body
just
demands
more
and
more
if
belgian
red
was
sold
by
the
gallon
thatd
be
fine
with
me
d
as
tasty
and
unusual
a
beer
as
ive
had
yet
one
best
kept
in
small
doses
i
recapped
the
bottle
in
hopes
of
enjoying
later
with
dessert
absolutely
worth
tryingseeking
out
certainly
one
to
be
shared
an
amazing
beer
i
just
cant
understand
how
they
get
so
much
cherry
flavor
in
the
beer
but
personally
its
too
sweet
for
me
so
whats
the
verdict
on
wisconsin
belgian
red
well
its
without
question
a
really
impressive
fruit
beer
but
it
is
a
fruit
beer
i
like
it
but
im
not
quite
in
love
with
it
im
not
sure
that
ive
ever
loved
a
fruit
beer
just
not
my
thing
its
very
sweet
and
is
probably
best
appreciated
in
concentrated
amounts
but
its
easily
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
encountered
its
not
very
beer
like
but
has
a
strong
enough
flavor
to
be
an
overall
success
from
me
thats
big
for
a
fruit
beer
trust
this
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
have
the
opportunity
just
keep
in
mind
that
youre
getting
a
fruit
beer
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
blood
red
with
a
tiny
bit
of
head
and
lots
of
little
carbonation
bubbles
that
float
to
the
top
the
smell
is
of
rich
cherries
theres
a
slight
whiff
of
alchohol
and
a
little
earthy
grassiness
the
flavor
is
so
intense
with
cherry
you
swear
you
were
drinking
a
glass
of
s
straight
cherry
juice
i
get
a
mild
alcohol
flavor
more
akin
to
wine
then
beer
but
its
faint
the
flavor
comes
on
sweet
and
tart
and
finishes
so
smooth
its
scary
the
carbonation
dances
with
every
gulp
gulp
is
the
proper
word
too
you
find
yourself
taking
drink
after
drink
because
ng
made
it
so
damn
enjoyable
ive
yet
to
meet
anyone
who
cant
enjoy
this
lambic
high
drinkability
however
the
big
bottle
would
be
better
shared
than
drank
alone
my
palate
usually
gets
a
bit
fatigued
by
the
end
of
the
second
glass
but
a
small
price
to
pay
for
such
a
terrific
beer
cheers
i
have
to
say
i
am
a
much
bigger
fan
of
raspberry
tart
but
this
is
still
a
more
than
stellar
offering
highly
recommended
and
it
definitely
earned
its
spot
in
the
top
100
d
i
could
probably
have
the
whole
thing
but
id
feel
bad
about
not
sharing
its
too
good
to
hog
d
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
the
raspberry
tart
but
a
great
representative
of
the
style
many
thanks
to
mnjeff
for
the
trade
d
and
overall
impression
for
me
it
is
too
sweet
i
really
enjoy
the
flavor
component
but
i
had
to
share
the
bottle
with
a
good
buddy
of
mine
so
it
doesnt
get
high
marks
here
overall
i
think
this
could
be
a
beer
my
wife
would
likeshes
not
a
craft
beer
lover
i
like
it
just
dont
love
it
skal
overall
great
drinkability
nice
smooth
feel
nice
faint
tartness
to
balance
out
the
strong
sweetness
nice
dry
feel
toward
the
end
the
cherry
flavor
is
not
artificial
which
i
was
a
bit
worried
about
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
very
sweet
like
really
ripe
cherries
taste
is
fresh
sweet
very
cherry
and
clean
and
at
the
same
time
a
little
earthy
the
sweet
and
earthy
seems
like
an
impossible
combination
the
mouth
feel
is
like
sweet
tarts
lots
of
bite
this
is
such
a
refreshing
beer
for
a
summer
day
best
served
cool
the
only
reason
i
discounted
the
drinkability
is
the
sweetness
it
may
be
hard
to
drink
much
of
this
at
once
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
beer
in
this
category
it
is
easy
to
see
how
this
beer
won
the
belgian
beer
contest
in
belgium
d
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
tried
without
a
doubt
d
im
not
the
hugest
fan
of
fruit
beers
so
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
this
but
im
glad
it
was
suggested
to
me
as
a
trade
because
it
turned
out
to
be
damn
good
if
i
saw
it
in
person
id
get
it
again
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
poured
a
very
rich
and
dark
cherry
head
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
very
strongly
cherries
and
some
hard
to
identify
spices
very
lively
mouthfeel
flavor
is
sweet
with
the
cherries
dominating
this
is
a
remarkable
fruit
beer
would
have
liked
just
a
touch
more
acidity
and
even
just
a
trace
of
funk
or
farmhouse
oh
well
still
this
is
nice
although
the
sweetness
keeps
the
drinkability
from
scoring
higher
the
liquid
pours
a
creamy
red
with
a
quickdying
head
the
smell
was
of
sweet
cherries
and
the
taste
was
exactly
the
same
i
expected
this
and
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
even
though
it
bordered
on
coy
for
me
personally
i
would
have
preferred
a
beer
i
could
see
through
lighter
body
and
a
bit
cleaner
on
the
finish
but
the
effervescent
tingle
in
my
mouth
after
each
sip
was
wonderful
overall
very
nice
taste
and
quite
drinkable
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
typical
kriek
but
it
is
good
nonetheless
d
one
or
two
glasses
is
pleanty
for
me
so
a
whole
bottle
is
too
much
the
tartness
and
fruit
flavors
become
too
much
for
my
palete
i
enjoyed
this
beer
when
it
was
cold
like
fridge
cold
it
was
fun
to
taste
it
as
it
warmed
but
i
found
it
better
cold
also
i
really
regret
not
pairing
this
beer
with
some
food
or
cheese
the
drink
is
crisp
mediumbodied
and
quaffable
with
a
snappy
spritz
of
refreshing
carbonation
a
supereasy
drinker
on
a
hot
june
afternoon
pours
an
almost
clear
brown
with
red
hues
very
thin
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
nose
is
cherry
juice
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
tastes
like
cherry
cough
syrup
almost
almost
seems
like
a
touch
of
apple
cider
on
the
back
there
as
well
eck
feel
is
much
like
the
flavor
syrupy
carbonation
is
a
bit
lower
i
guess
good
lord
what
a
disappointment
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
drink
i
put
this
on
the
level
of
all
those
overly
sugared
fruit
beers
from
belgium
this
just
makes
me
miss
liefmans
kriek
even
more
drinkability
very
drinkable
another
outstanding
effort
from
new
glarus
cheers
troy
d
goes
down
really
smooth
no
alcohol
detected
at
all
but
thats
not
really
a
surprise
fruit
doesnt
belong
in
beer
that
being
said
this
was
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
d
split
this
with
my
girlfriend
but
probably
could
have
easily
split
this
three
ways
we
finished
it
easily
but
my
craving
for
this
type
of
beer
has
been
satisfied
for
a
while
d
too
much
fruit
for
one
person
to
finish
off
a
whole
bottle
but
found
it
to
be
a
superior
after
dinner
drink
nicely
done
dan
another
excellent
desert
brew
from
ng
much
like
the
raspberry
tart
this
would
pair
well
with
anything
chocolate
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
cherries
and
tart
and
funky
fruit
brews
ill
be
enjoying
this
one
again
soon
enough
good
for
after
dinner
or
a
single
drink
i
believe
it
may
be
too
syrupy
to
have
any
more
than
a
single
glass
im
glad
and
shes
glad
too
that
i
shared
this
with
my
girlfriend
she
loved
it
looking
forward
to
more
of
this
stuff
d
absolutely
sublime
if
i
were
able
to
get
this
at
all
times
i
would
never
have
a
mimosa
ever
again
the
perfect

concoction
and
a
wonderful

hello
wisconsin
belgian
red
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
had
the
joy
of
drinking
very
nice
this
gets
a
bit
much
towards
the
end
the
flavor
is
fine
but
man
you
start
to
really
feel
the
sugar
this
and
the
raspberry
tart
are
so
close
when
it
comes
to
preference
its
almost
ridiculous
the
tart
may
have
a
slight
edge
in
taste
but
not
much
both
fantastic
beers
overall
impressioncherries
dessert
in
a
glass
d
thanks
to
imperialking
for
this
one
very
good
but
i
prefer
the
raspberry
tart
pours
a
fairly
clear
reddish
brown
thats
appears
to
be
carbonated
like
a
cola
a
small
white
head
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
of
world
class
cherries
a
not
much
else
first
sip
is
tart
full
of
cherries
with
a
tad
of
oak
and
vanilla
note
present
but
lacking
in
malt
very
lightly
carbonated
super
sweet
closer
to
wine
than
beer
cloudy
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
that
lingers
for
a
long
time
smell
is
dominated
by
tart
and
sweet
cherries
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
in
the
background
taste
cherries
delicious
cherries
the
perfect
balance
of
tart
sour
and
sweet
whatever
beer
flavor
is
in
here
is
very
subtle
think
of
wisconsin
belgian
red
as
more
of
a
fruit
wine
than
a
lambic
so
while
the
beerlover
in
me
might
wonder
what
the
hype
is
about
my
tastebuds
will
not
deny
how
fantastically
delicious
this
is
high
sugar
content
makes
for
a
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
though
high
carbonation
keeps
it
from
being
unpleasant
sweetness
limits
drinkability
but
yummy
cherry
flavors
beckon
me
for
another
glass
what
a
great
brew
and
my
nonbeer
drinking
wife
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
as
well
in
addition
to
my
wine
drinking
only
neighbors
d
a
beer
id
want
to
drink
around
christmas
instead
of
those
shitty
macro
christmas
beers
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
special
occasions
or
holidays
and
one
that
can
be
used
to
supplement
or
replace
wine
the
cost
alone
makes
it
a
beer
i
couldnt
have
frequently
but
when
the
moment
is
right
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
it
up
i
could
put
a
bottle
of
this
down
rather
easily
conclusion
perfect
dessert
beer
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
this
was
available
in
ct
all
the
time
really
not
what
i
expected
and
i
was
blown
away
not
really
a
fan
of
fruit
beer
or
cherries
but
this
one
still
tasted
good
to
me
so
if
you
are
a
fan
of
either
you
will
probably
be
in
love
with
this
beer
the
only
knock
i
have
on
it
is
the
drinkability
because
like
i
said
i
havent
gotten
into
the
style
yet
poured
from
wax
sealed
bottle
into
new
belgium
goblet
pours
a
clear
medium
ruby
red
with
about
12
foamy
pinkish
head
that
settles
to
a
bubble
film
with
some
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
very
strong
sugary
sweet
but
very
tart
cherries
cherry
is
the
only
thing
i
can
smell
in
this
beer
but
thats
ok
because
i
love
cherries
the
aroma
literally
makes
my
mouth
water
taste
is
intensely
rich
sweet
and
tart
cherries
i
love
it
its
like
liquid
cherry
pie
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
feels
a
little
sticky
sweet
the
sweetness
limits
the
drinkablility
just
a
tad
its
a
little
cloying
but
this
beer
is
so
delicious
i
cant
put
the
glass
down
couldnt
drink
this
beer
very
often
but
it
makes
a
great
treat
once
and
a
while
d
amazing
i
would
expect
nothing
less
this
beer
actually
tastes
like
cherry
pie
and
is
a
delicious
dessert
beer
great
brew
this
may
be
the
best
fruit
beer
on
the
planet
i
know
i
havent
had
a
better
one
yet
but
it
is
very
delicious
and
anyone
beer
drinker
or
not
should
seek
this
one
out
if
they
get
a
chance
this
could
convert
some
nonbeer
drinkers
to
start
if
i
would
have
one
compliant
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
of
i
tried
to
sit
down
and
drink
a
bottle
by
myself
and
couldnt
finish
it
plan
to
drink
this
with
friends
especially
nonbeer
lovers
who
may
be
converted
with
this
sweet
nectar
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
it
more
times
than
i
can
count
every
time
that
i
have
this
beer
i
am
amazed
by
how
good
it
is
yet
another
excellent
brew
from
new
glarus
i
like
the
raspberry
tart
better
personally
but
this
is
crafted
just
as
well
seek
this
one
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
kriek
not
at
all
complex
just
an
exquisitely
crafted
fruit
beer
that
has
exceptional
drinkability
fans
of
cherries
andor
fruit
beers
should
seek
this
one
out
thanks
to
dancinwillie
for
the
opportunity
to
savor
this
wisconsin
treasure
d
this
5
beer
would
fill
my
fridge
if
i
lived
near
ng
this
is
great
on
its
own
or
paired
with
some
dessert
or
with
other
beers
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
it
probably
would
be
a
great
hit
with
the
ladies
as
well
m
d
finishes
dry
and
crisp
leaving
little
aftertaste
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
in
it
i
think
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
brew
if
youve
got
deep
pockets
some
people
dont
like
the
sweet
brews
like
this
but
i
think
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
d
great
if
you
can
over
the
cough
syrup
pours
a
deep
ruby
mahogany
red
head
appears
but
goes
away
quickly
beautiful
color
smell
is
not
surprisingly
of
cherries
big
dark
perfectly
ripe
cherries
only
knock
is
the
lack
of
other
aromas
but
this
beer
is
what
it
is
and
it
does
it
well
taste
again
cherries
not
complex
in
the
sense
that
other
beers
are
but
just
fantastic
not
at
all
syrupy
or
overly
sweet
just
intense
cherry
flavor
what
can
i
say
i
absolutely
loved
it
would
not
want
this
every
day
or
even
every
week
but
this
beer
at
the
right
time
and
place
is
simply
amazing
this
is
probably
the
first
beer
i
could
drink
with
a
meal
incredibly
tasty
and
i
will
seek
this
out
any
chance
i
get
overall
very
crisp
fresh
and
fruity
as
stated
before
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
summer
day
outdoors
plus
my
wife
who
is
not
a
big
beer
fan
enjoys
it
alot
too
plus
one
for
me
d
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
onedimensional
brew
but
the
wisconsin
belgian
red
really
does
the
cherry
profile
very
well
the
cherry
flavors
come
through
as
fresh
and
in
no
way
artificial
the
alcohol
stays
completely
out
of
the
way
which
also
helps
this
category
out
very
nice
brew
from
new
glarus
that
is
easily
recommended
d
the
consummate
libation
to
savor
while
enjoying
a
cherryhued
door
county
sunset
overall
excellent
beer
and
i
was
kind
of
leery
of
this
going
into
the
tasting
ended
up
being
something
that
i
would
maybe
by
one
of
on
visits
to
wisconsin
but
this
is
defintely
a
dessert
beer
my
complaints
are
no
real
complexity
it
tastes
like
cherries
the
end
and
it
could
use
some
oak
d
outstanding
if
this
stuff
was
more
readily
available
for
me
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
this
stuff
is
liquid
desert
an
absolute
treat
for
beer
geeks
with
a
sweet
tooth
d
low
abv
and
not
cloying
at
all
its
a
keeper
hey
maybe
i
will
learn
to
like
sour
beers
yet
drinkability
is
excellent
poured
into
a
taster
glass
pours
a
ruby
red
with
little
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
nice
pink
head
smell
is
simply
amazing
but
you
must
like
cherries
to
enjoy
this
litterly
smells
like
fresh
warm
cherry
pie
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
nice
heavy
carbonated
cherrie
flavor
this
reminds
me
of
a
liquid
cherry
candy
a
bit
of
tart
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
overall
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
to
date
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
bottles
of
this
at
one
time
which
could
be
a
dangerous
thing
the
master
crafters
at
new
glarus
really
know
how
to
make
impressive
fruit
beers
drinkability
wasnt
too
high
id
have
a
hard
time
drinking
an
entire
bottle
good
thing
i
had
a
buddy
to
share
it
with
overall
delicious
fruity
beer
much
like
a
champaign
or
sparkling
wine
great
as
a
desert
beer
overall
i
preferred
the
raspberry
tart
a
little
more
but
this
is
a
great
beer
nonetheless
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
drink
one
for
dessert
all
the
time
everyone
should
try
this
beer
pours
a
brilliant
and
beautiful
deep
cranberry
color
nice
fluffy
pinkish
head
hangs
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
a
few
spots
of
lacing
thousands
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
the
smells
and
flavors
are
just
perfectly
in
sync
big
robust
tart
and
rich
cherry
insanity
wow
sticky
sweet
moutfheel
tartness
zinging
the
tongue
and
taste
buds
this
is
just
an
absolute
treat
and
the
beer
drinkers
in
wisconsin
are
extremely
lucky
to
have
a
brewery
like
new
glarus
d
pretty
drinkable
if
you
are
not
diabetic
i
enjoy
the
occasion
sweet
good
desert
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
slick
with
a
touch
of
a
syrupy
quality
to
it
from
the
residuals
sugars
of
the
fruit
i
assume
quite
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
the
girlfriend
enjoys
as
well
i
could
probably
drink
the
whole
bottle
though
too
the
top
tier
of
fruit
beers
for
me
and
one
i
always
enjoy
drinking
worth
a
trip
to
wisconsin
grab
some
raspberry
tart
as
well
syrupy
mouthfeel
lighter
carbonation
when
compared
to
the
raspberry
tart
the
sweetness
knocks
this
one
down
a
rung
for
me
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
very
different
yet
enjoyable
i
do
prefer
the
raspberry
tart
over
this
one
however
attractive
bottle
with
wax
melted
over
the
cap
no
dates
of
any
kind
i
sort
of
wonder
if
i
got
an
older
bottle
read
on
pours
clear
cherry
red
with
thin
head
that
almost
immediately
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
obvious
sweet
cherry
aroma
with
a
little
sour
yeast
taste
follows
smell
almost
like
an
alcoholic
cherry
soda
but
with
a
somewhat
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
of
candied
cherries
not
at
all
complex
i
feel
like
this
beer
could
use
a
little
more
balance
maybe
a
little
more
in
the
hops
department
i
couldnt
taste
any
as
it
is
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
sticky
syrup
overall
this
is
interesting
and
worth
a
try
but
i
would
recommend
splitting
the
bottle
between
four
people
try
it
with
something
of
considerable
contrast
like
salty
rye
or
pumpernickel
crackers
and
mild
cheese
like
gouda
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
sharing
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
bright
maroon
with
some
light
penetration
pour
revealed
a
quarter
inch
wispy
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
soapy
swirl
nose
was
cherry
sucrets
and
cinnamon
taste
follows
nose
with
some
additional
cinnamon
heat
mouthfeel
fell
between
light
and
medium
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
drinking
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
extremely
flavorful
without
being
sickeningly
sweet
and
low
abv
makes
it
a
great
dessert
beer
im
enjoying
this
will
definitely
buy
again
its
a
nice
addition
to
the
fruit
beers
in
the
fridge

the

probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
it
makes
me
sad
everyday
that
colorado
cant
get
it
a
murky

to
dark

something
akin
to
a
reddish

this

of

d
although
this
beer
is
absolutley
delicious
its
certainly
not
superdrinkable
its
somewhat
heavy
and
the
sugar
content
is
a
bit
excessive
i
felt
like
i
got
a
sugar
rush
and
then
crashed
after
half
a
bottle
overall
make
sure
to
share
because
one
bottle
is
a
lot
for
one
person
but
a
very
good
beer
with
a
really
fresh
flavor
and
smell
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
something
you
will
mostly
sip
because
of
the
big
flavor
i
finished
the
whole
bottle
myself
but
it
didnt
go
quickly
d
a
world
class
beer
for
sure
and
deserved
of
all
the
hype
easily
my
favorite
fruit
beer
ever
and
one
i
will
gladly
have
again
and
again
poured
into
a
champagne
flute
as
recommended
this
brew
is
a
wonderful
sparkling
ruby
red
with
a
pink
head
that
bubbles
to
the
top
of
the
glass
and
settles
to
a
paper
thin
cap
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
amazing
with
strong
cherry
and
a
sweetness
that
dances
in
your
nostrils
the
taste
is
bold
as
the
carbonation
tickles
your
throat
and
the
bold
cherry
flavor
explodes
with
every
sip
the
tart
aftertaste
is
a
great
balance
of
the
sweet
cherry
taste
even
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
what
can
i
say
it
has
taken
me
too
long
to
try
this
beer
everyone
who
has
pointed
me
in
this
direction
was
right
light
bodied
and
it
really
leaves
a
nice
sweet
cherry
slick
on
your
palate
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
if
it
had
less
carbonation
it
would
be
too
syrupy
this
is
very
drinkable
with
the
low
abv
and
refreshing
quality
these
go
down
like
nothing
bears
little
resemblance
to
your
typical
beer
but
all
around
a
really
good
brew
easily
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
available
anywhere
really
i
find
this
beer
similar
to
the
red
and
white
from
dfh
an
interesting
melding
of
flavors
i
would
consider
keeping
this
in
the
cellar
for
when
guests
come
around
for
something
different
as
a
dessert
drink
d
i
mean
its
not
really
like
drinking
a
beer
there
is
little
resemblance
of
a
beer
so
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
i
might
get
sick
of
it
this
is
a
weird
drink
but
weird
done
perfectly
overall
a
truly
awesome
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
highly
recommended
about
as
perfect
a
brew
as
one
can
think
of
its
more
than
a
fruit
beer
its
the
nectar
of
the
beer
gods
big
thanks
to
jonstubb
for
this
beer
poured
out
in
to
a
wine
glass
a
murky
dark
pink
with
lighter
hues
towards
the
top
and
a
small
whitepink
head
smell
is
of
fresh
cherries
and
other
fresh
red
fruits
jolly
rancher
some
vinous
properties
hints
of
oak
and
wine
flavor
is
composed
of
luscious
cherries
pie
crust
more
oak
bits
of
tart
funk
here
and
there
but
overall
more
sweet
body
is
light
with
wonderful
carbonation
that
prickles
the
tongue
ever
so
slightly
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
made
up
of
malt
and
hops
as
the
fruit
is
so
damn
prevalent
drinking
this
is
far
too
easy
i
could
probably
go
through
two
bottles
this
is
close
to
being
a
perfect
beer
for
me
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
this
would
be
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
i
saved
this
to
open
on
thanksgiving
as
a
dessert
beer
i
half
expected
that
this
would
be
a
cloying
sweet
syrupy
cherry
overload
thankfully
it
is
none
of
the
above
nice
red
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
smells
and
tastes
as
everyone
has
already
noted
like
tons
of
fresh
cherries
amazing
that
new
glarus
was
able
to
pull
off
a
fruit
beer
that
has
tons
of
fruit
flavor
without
hampering
drinkability
low
abv
and
light
to
medium
body
plus
fairly
high
carbonation
make
this
chuggable
d
i
couldnt
drink
this
everyday
but
it
truly
is
a
great
drink
and
would
never
complain
when
i
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
if
you
have
friends
who
dont
like
beer
get
them
to
try
this
it
should
open
their
eyes
to
the
versatility
of
beer
styles
d
new
glaruss
fruit
beers
are
a
testament
to
why
we
should
all
move
to
wisconsin
or
at
least
befriend
someone
from
this
great
state
already
famous
for
its
cheese
i
think
beer
is
a
good
pairing
i
would
buy
this
beer
often
and
drink
it
on
many
occasions
were
i
able
to
drank
half
of
a
bottle
savoring
it
all
the
only
thing
slowing
me
down
drinking
this
was
making
sure
to
savor
every
drop
strong
acidity
is
the
only
drawback
but
no
problem
here
as
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
share
with
friends
and
family
huge
thanks
to
jeremy
drseamus
for
sending
this
my
way
this
may
be
one
of
the
first
beers
of
mine
that
my
fiance
actually
approved
of
definitely
a
must
try
brewed
with
montmorency
cherries
purportedly
a
pound
of
whole
cherries
per
bottle
locally
grown
wheat
and
hallertau
hops
the
beer
is
then
left
to
mature
in
12
ft
tall
oak
tanks
okay
great
lets
get
to
it
murky
rubyhue
capped
by
a
flamingopink
head
appearance
and
harbors
an
aroma
reeking
of
unabashed
cherrynicity
theres
nothing
fake
or
artificial
about
this
beer
with
a
taste
reminiscent
of
fruit
leather
the
flavor
is
certainly
aggressive
in
its
sheer
determination
to
cram
that
pound
of
cherries
down
your
damn
throat
it
deftly
walks
the
fine
line
between
sweet
and
tart
and
carries
with
it
a
jolt
of
juicy
cheekpinching
acidity
the
malted
wheat
and
hops
definitely
take
a
backseat
to
the
deep
strong
cherry
fruitiness
god
i
hope
you
like
cherries
the
high
level
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
does
well
to
bring
a
muchneeded
levity
to
what
otherwise
would
be
a
heavy
body
you
do
like
cherries
right
overall
a
deliciously
unique
beverage
though
i
suspect
some
may
be
left
angrily
shouting
the
catchphrase
wheres
the
beer
i
bought
two
bottles
will
let
the
other
age
a
bit
and
hopefully
the
sweetness
will
relax
a
bit
glad
i
had
the
young
one
but
wont
likely
have
another
till
the
second
bottle
ages
6
months
or
so
overall
a
great
treat
thanks
to
dontcallmesurly
for
the
trade
pours
a
light
orange
color
bordering
on
pink
with
a
light
amount
of
foam
into
a
brandy
snifter
nice
waft
bright
tart
cherries
and
not
much
else
in
the
nose
do
you
need
anything
else
when
they
use
a
pound
of
wi
cherries
per
bottle
taste
is
tart
cherry
a
nice
base
beer
flavor
semisweet
and
somewhat
dry
on
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
oh
so
very
tasty
probably
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
tasted
so
much
cherry
goodness
in
this
one
but
its
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
at
a
time
perfect
for
dessert
with
a
slice
of
cheesecake
i
prefer
the
raspberry
tart
over
this
because
this
one
is
a
little
shallow
to
me
it
is
good
though
and
i
will
likely
purchase
it
again
drinkability
is
good
limited
by
sweetness
as
i
do
not
have
much
of
a
sweet
tooth
i
would
not
want
more
than
about
half
of
one
bottle
at
a
sitting
mouthfeeldrinkability
perfect
carbonation
with
a
fizzy
and
smooth
feel
fizzy
upfront
but
in
the
back
nice
and
smooth
this
beer
could
be
drank
all
night
long
absolutely
fantastic
overall
this
is
one
fantastic
brew
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
sorry
to
see
this
bottle
empty
i
knew
i
shouldnt
have
shared
this
with
my
girlfriend
and
her
mother
d
super
easy
drinking
just
enough
tartness
to
balance
the
sweetness
best
damn
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
had
my
favorite
beer
of
the
night
and
that
is
saying
something
overall
it
is
similar
to
the
raspberry
tart
by
new
glarus
because
it
seems
to
lack
some
of
the
beer
flavors
however
it
is
still
a
great
beer
and
deserving
of
both
its
rank
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
captures
the
flavor
of
cherries
but
i
would
of
liked
more
beer
qualities
the
bottle
goes
quickly
and
the
low
abv
helps
drinkability
a
surprisingly
fluffy
two
fingers
of
light
tan
head
sits
on
top
of
a
murky
brownish
red
body
nose
is
amazing
like
crisp
suger
glazed
perfectly
ripe
cherries
wow
is
what
comes
to
mind
with
first
sip
an
interesting
combination
of
cherry
pie
filling
fruit
wine
and
malt
liquer
it
is
just
bursting
with
juicey
cherries
and
even
a
hint
of
raspberry
a
hint
of
tartness
balances
out
all
the
sweetness
nicely
mouthfeel
is
lush
and
you
really
cant
stop
drinking
so
split
the
bottle
or
drinkability
would
suggest
maybe
you
keep
it
all
to
yourself
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
beer
blends
with
a
good
smooth
porter
so
many
possibilities
with
this
one
big
thanks
to
unclejedi
for
sending
this
as
part
of
my
powerball
winnings
d
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
its
easily
drinkable
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
you
can
tell
its
a
well
built
beer
though
d
well
crafted
but
i
can
barely
drink
1
glass
way
too
fruit
forward
for
me
i
like
fruit
beers
a
little
more
subtle
than
this
d
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
its
easily
drinkable
im
glad
im
moving
to
wi
so
i
can
have
more
of
this
new
glarus
belgian
red
poured
a
brownish
reddish
color
smell
was
all
of
cherries
very
sweet
nose
the
taste
was
sweet
and
sour
cherries
tasted
close
to
a
belgian
flemish
red
not
overly
sweet
and
a
nice
tart
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
bit
thick
drinkability
was
nice
overall
a
good
beer
i
wish
that
new
glarus
would
send
some
of
their
beer
to
illinois
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
including
this
beer
in
a
very
generous
trade
and
giving
me
the
chance
to
have
this
again
and
finally
review
it
this
beer
is
even
better
than
i
remember
it
extremely
rich
and
spicy
with
laserlike
cherry
flavors
almost
tastes
like
a
slightly
less
spicy
version
of
a
gluhkriek
there
is
so
much
spicy
goodness
in
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
red
leaning
toward
brown
a
bit
smells
of
sour
cherries
cream
spicebox
notes
and
a
slight
cheesy
funk
probably
from
the
aged
hops
the
taste
is
downright
magnificent
glorious
sweet
and
sour
cherries
with
an
almost
vinous
finish
a
touch
more
of
that
cheesy
funk
and
lots
of
spice
clove
allspice
pepper
cinnamon
complex
deeply
flavored
and
long
and
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
that
ends
in
a
spicy
snap
more
proof
that
complex
belgian
style
brews
can
be
masterfully
done
in
the
u
s
a
wonderful
beer
absolutely
superb
and
worthy
of
the
belgian
in
its
name
new
glarus
went
allout
with
this
one
a
musttry
even
for
those
who
claim
to
dislike
fruit
beers
this
one
could
completely
change
your
mind
although
i
preferred
raspberry
tart
to
this
beer
the
bright
pink
head
and
tartness
in
flavor
gave
it
a
slight
edge
both
were
truly
phenomenal
products
now
if
they
only
did
distribute
this
outside
of
wisconsin
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
simply
gorgeous
a
shade
of
brownish
red
perhaps
a
mahogany
red
whatever
color
you
would
call
it
it
is
beautiful
and
not
far
short
of
perfect
wonderful
smell
with
cherries
and
oakiness
a
touch
of
hoppiness
and
malt
coming
through
in
harmony
the
taste
is
even
better
cherries
dancing
on
the
tongue
with
the
smooth
oakiness
balancing
perfectly
a
touch
of
sourness
adds
some
contrast
as
well
with
the
traditional
beerlike
tastes
of
hoppiness
and
malt
delicately
coming
through
towards
the
end
a
long
and
smooth
finish
that
is
about
as
delicious
and
drinkable
as
beer
gets
exquisite
notes
my
girlfriend
and
her
sister
fell
in
love
with
this
only
to
have
their
hearts
crushed
finding
out
it
was
from
wisconsin
looks
like
another
trade
shall
be
in
the
works
thanks
drdogbeer
i
consider
it
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
a
musttry
for
anyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
it
drinkability
as
a
fruit
dessert
beer
outstanding
a
very
impressive
natural
cherry
flavor
that
i
imagine
was
pretty
tough
to
achieve
a
completely
manageable
abv
as
well
you
gotta
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
though
as
its
definitely
all
cherries
all
the
time
give
it
a
go
drinkability
now
if
you
are
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
drink
this
doesnt
taste
like
beer
at
all
would
be
perfect
as
a
new
years
eve
toast
rather
than
champagne
or
a
wedding
toast
some
special
occasion
such
as
that
i
could
easily
suck
it
down
fast
like
my
morning
orange
juice
but
when
i
want
a
beer
this
just
wont
be
a
go
to
one
give
this
one
to
your
friends
who
dont
like
beer
they
will
like
this
one
for
sure
i
will
attempt
to
keep
at
least
one
bottle
on
hand
though
for
occasions
as
above
nicely
made
beer
for
what
it
is
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
color
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cherries
with
a
ton
of
tartness
and
an
underlying
nuttiness
the
taste
is
a
lot
more
sour
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
lot
of
cherry
some
nuttiness
and
a
lingering
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
look
for
it
and
enjoy
drinkability
a
great
beer
definitely
off
the
beaten
path
like
a
liquid
version
of
sour
cherry
jam
very
refreshing
interested
in
trying
some
of
this
brewerys
other
concoctions
pours
a
slightly
hazy
red
with
dark
orange
hues
2
fingers
of
fluffy
pinkish
eggshell
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
beautiful
lacing
smells
of
sour
cherries
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
light
bread
much
like
fresh
cherry
cobbler
tastes
of
brown
sugar
and
light
cinnamon
along
with
pie
dough
and
a
huge
dose
of
sour
cherries
with
a
touch
of
grass
medium
in
body
with
great
fizzy
carbonation
almost
champagnelike
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
excellent
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
nice
punch
of
tartness
this
is
definitely
among
my
top
dessert
beers
and
wouldnt
mind
having
it
every
week
with
sunday
dinner
overall
another
great
dessert
beer
exactly
like
cherry
pie
thanks
scott
d
extremely
drinkable
this
is
one
that
i
could
have
any
time
and
have
no
problem
drinking
big
thanks
to
ughsmash
for
breaking
this
out
at
the
rbsg

grand
tasting

flavor

cherry

filling
this
beer
embodies
the
sweetsour
dynamic
that
makes
cherries
so
good
phenomenal
dessert
beer
i
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
this
offering
by
the
folks
at
tiny
new
glarus
brewery
had
the
kind
of
national
following
that
it
does
it
deserves
it
try
it
at
least
once
shades
of
a
flanders
red
are
apparent
d
a
great
choice
served
chilled
on
a
warm
summer
night
750ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
dark
cherry
red
color
with
a
light
pinkish
colored
head
the
deliciously
enticing
aroma
is
filled
with
cherries
not
the
typical
artificial
cherry
flavoring
in
most
fruit
beers
but
a
really
fresh
cherry
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
with
a
good
dose
of
cherries
wow
this
is
a
really
great
beer
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
definitely
not
overly
sweet
and
artificial
like
your
typical
fruit
beer
would
make
for
an
awesome
dessert
beer
highly
recommended
this
beer
was
tasted
in
a
wine
glass
from
the
750ml
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pinkish
red
with
a
white
head
sporting
a
hint
of
pink
as
well
the
head
dissipates
without
leaving
much
lace
the
smell
is
straight
cherry
juice
the
taste
bursts
forth
with
more
cherries
and
a
bit
of
tartness
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
but
the
cherries
really
dominate
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
a
nice
fruit
beer
displaying
the
cherries
very
well
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
overwhelming
for
me
this
is
an
unusual
beer
no
doubt
and
perhaps
too
unique
to
return
to
every
day
its
certainly
interesting
though
and
quite
delicious
ill
pick
up
another
bottle
without
question
pours
a
murky
apple
cider
golden
brown
into
a
snifter
short
one
finger
head
leaves
spotty
lacing
smells
of
cherries
shocking
i
know
bits
of
caramel
and
spice
here
and
there
bit
the
cherries
almost
completely
dominate
the
nose
the
first
few
sips
are
like
liquid
cherry
candy
after
a
bit
of
warming
the
caramel
and
spice
pull
out
for
a
better
balance
i
kinda
wish
i
hadnt
chilled
it
at
all
medium
body
carbonation
make
for
a
smooth
drink
too
sweet
to
want
more
than
one
bottle
but
the
one
is
damn
tasty
a
very
unique
brew
perfect
for
a
summer
evening
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
at
a
slow
pace
not
something
i
want
in
a
six
pack
for
tailgating
rather
slow
small
glasses
during
a
party
i
love
this
stuff
it
and
its
raspberry
brother
are
the
best
fruit
beers
in
the
world
ill
never
quite
understand
why
fruitbeer
hating
geeks
love
these
as
theyre
the
fruitiest
of
them
all
but
who
cares
this
is
great
tasted
on
53108
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
reddishpurple
color
with
a
light
white
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
very
strong
with
a
nice
sour
cherriness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
it
is
very
smooth
flavor
is
a
nice
tart
cherry
taste
with
a
nice
sour
aftertaste
an
excellent
beer
d
drinkability
isnt
as
high
as
it
could
be
because
of
the
heavy
sweetness
but
thats
really
nitpicking
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
one
i
have
ever
tasted
pours
a
deep
cloudy
read
with
a
nice
white
head
with
a
slight
pinkish
head
nose
is
of
some
cherry
and
a
bit
of
tartness
flavor
is
a
deep
red
tart
cherry
flavor
almost
a
spritzer
type
quality
in
the
mouthfeel
a
very
refreshing
but
extremely
sweet
beverage
to
be
enjoyed
for
desert
on
a
summer
day
excellent
brew
one
to
be
admired
i
still
prefer
the
raspberry
tart
but
this
is
defenitely
the
second
best
cherry
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
the
best
cherry
beer
of
this
style
i
have
had
undoubtedly
thanks
again
to
dana
for
letting
go
of
this
one
d
very
drinkable
edit
after
a
couple
years
of
drinking
both
the
tart
and
the
red
the
red
is
much
better
scores
reflected
a
classic
shame
about
the
lack
of
head
retention
lacing
but
id
have
this
in
the
rotation
if
i
lived
in
the
dairy
state
for
sure
appearance
is
hazy
orange
with
red
and
pink
hues
a
rocky
white
head
settles
after
a
moment
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
has
cherry
pie
upfront
but
behind
that
there
is
some
nice
malty
notes
and
other
interesting
finds
like
buttery
graham
cracker
crust
and
cheesecake
flowery
hops
dance
around
the
malt
and
cherries
very
complex
nose
right
out
of
the
gate
in
the
taste
is
fresh
doorcounty
cherry
pie
what
follows
is
an
interesting
mix
of
malt
and
roselike
hop
flavors
hop
bitterness
however
is
fairly
restrained
and
it
could
be
ramped
up
a
bit
to
balance
the
moderate
sweetness
im
shocked
this
is
only
5abv
because
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
a
very
complex
beer
that
you
could
spend
all
night
finding
new
things
to
discover
within
dont
miss
it
deep
yet
bright
ruby
in
color
with
thin
lacing
when
swirled
the
nose
shows
off
an
abundance
of
rotting
cherries
this
continued
into
a
mediumbodied
palate
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
crispness
while
simple
this
is
very
wellbalanced
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
you
savor
enjoy
and
rue
over
when
its
gone
i
have
got
to
trade
for
more
of
this
its
too
good
not
to
have
more
of
great
great
great
and
something
i
wish
i
could
always
have
a
bottle
or
two
of
stowed
away
and
of
course
the
lady
loves
it
drinkability
is
very
high
with
me
though
i
have
been
told
by
friends
that
they
could
not
drink
alot
if
this
because
of
the
sweetness
but
for
me
i
could
drink
the
whole
750ml
bottle
i
stocked
up
on
this
after
my
first
taste
awesome
brew
that
everyone
should
seek
out
can
see
the
ladies
liken
this
one
d
tons
of
flavor
for
such
a
small
beer
as
a
brewer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
toally
blows
my
mind
how
did
they
do
this
the
body
is
hard
to
pin
down
with
a
moderate
feel
but
with
the
sweetness
that
lasts
into
the
finish
gives
it
more
of
a
fuller
texture
because
this
is
so
sweet
it
deters
from
drinking
too
much
and
leaves
a
lot
of
aftertaste
overall
a
fun
beer
and
must
try
at
least
once
taste
is
tart
fresh
juicy
cherries
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
but
i
prefer
it
that
way
surprisingly
noncloying
and
doesnt
get
old
or
tiring
to
drink
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
great
fruit
beer
just
thinking
about
some
other
fruit
beers
that
i
think
missed
the
mark
southern
tiers
raspberry
porter
comes
to
mind
this
beer
is
right
on
the
sweetness
is
accompanied
by
a
thick
full
body
and
enticing
tartness
that
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
d
the
750ml
was
way
too
much
for
me
its
very
tasty
but
in
small
doses
id
say
splitting
a
750
with
3
other
people
would
be
perfect
for
my
liking
also
it
completely
changes
as
it
warms
up
i
love
the
color
of
this
one
it
pours
out
a
sexy
cherry
really
with
hints
of
mahogany
around
the
edges
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
head
on
this
one
as
it
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
either
a
very
powerful
tart
cherry
character
is
present
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
a
lot
of
tart
cherries
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
this
bottle
had
a
very
bitter
aftertaste
which
i
dont
recall
from
previous
batches
maybe
my
palate
was
off
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
this
and
its
kind
of
similar
to
champagne
in
mouthfeel
i
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
this
one
and
look
forward
to
drinking
plenty
of
this
in
the
upcoming
summer
months
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
nice
sourness
cheers
to
jw347
and
scoobydank
for
sending
bottles
my
way
overall
a
good
brew
that
id
like
to
have
the
chance
to
try
again
since
i
do
most
of
my
drinking
in
wisconsin
i
have
become
a
big
fan
of
new
glarus
this
beligian
red
was
very
tasty
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
pink
head
perfect
tart
cherry
flavor
not
overly
sweet
and
not
too
tart
this
served
with
a
good
cheescake
or
even
a
sorbet
would
be
the
cats
ass
new
glarus
did
a
fantastic
job
with
this
one
this
is
a
pleasure
to
savor
but
drinks
much
easier
than
other
offerings
crafted
at
this
level
of
excellence
great
stuff
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
the
ultimate
fruit
ale
yet
but
it
ranks
very
high
it
has
so
many
flavors
and
doesnt
hold
back
it
tastes
fresh
sweet
yet
is
something
that
can
be
sipped
and
savored
for
hours
new
glarus
has
really
made
a
fine
cherry
beer
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
all
in
all
you
must
get
this
beer
great
job
mr
carey
d
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
its
fantastic
not
as
sour
or
tart
as
a
kriek
lambic
but
rich
in
flavor
and
quite
tasty
i
wish
this
came
out
to
the
east
coast
poured
from
bottle
into
a
chimay
goblet
totally
different
look
from
what
i
was
expecting
i
should
have
taken
that
into
consideration
for
the
rest
of
the
experience
they
say
they
put
1
lb
of
cheeries
into
every
bottle
i
believe
them
funky
pinkish
hue
to
the
beer
with
tons
of
carbonation
tastes
the
same
as
it
looks
almost
like
drinking
cherry
champagne
the
smell
is
amazing
something
out
of
my
childhood
candy
or
something
similar
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
i
will
never
drink
a
fruit
beer
and
not
compare
it
to
this
one
new
glarus
impresses
me
once
again
dbest
kept
quite
cold
i
was
hoping
my
wife
would
help
with
this
one
but
she
doesnt
like
it
its
decent
and
something
im
glad
to
try
but
only
once
utterly
sublime
taste
mouthfeel
sweet
and
juicy
the
cherries
really
take
over
this
beer
its
like
liquid
cherry
pie
low
acidity
and
very
mild
sourness
the
malt
backbone
is
soft
barely
noticeable
to
my
palate
fullbodied
yet
spritzy
a
clean
finish
without
much
residual
sweetness
makes
this
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
most
sweet
beers
but
the
sweetness
does
still
become
taxing
after
a
while
one
glass
is
plenty
but
its
one
highly
enjoyable
glass
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
ruby
hues
no
real
head
is
produced
on
the
pour
aroma
is
nice
and
fairly
gentle
notes
of
tart
cherry
and
tangy
wheat
taste
is
also
quite
nice
tart
cherry
and
tangy
wheat
mostly
with
a
bit
of
a
drier
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
low
alcohol
and
good
flavors
make
for
easy
consumption
i
did
not
really
enjoy
this
as
a
beer
if
it
were
bottled
as
a
nonalcoholic
cherry
cider
i
would
have
believed
it
imo
it
was
a
syrupy
overrated
mess
overall
as
with
the
raspberry
tart
i
must
admit
to
being
overwhelmed
by
these
brews
they
are
highquality
for
sure
as
the
taste
is
clearly
natural
not
artificial
but
not
for
me
which
is
strange
because
i
actually
like
many
fruit
beers
but
i
guess
these
particular
ones
arent
for
me
i
am
grateful
for
being
able
to
try
them
though
pours
a
rich
murky
maroon
color
with
a
creamy
pinkish
hued
fluffy
head
smell
is
a
great
big
rich
fresh
sour
cherry
aroma
thick
full
mouthfeel
especially
for
a
fruit
beer
taste
is
slightly
mouth
puckering
sour
cherry
tartness
very
fresh
and
enjoyable
a
touch
acidic
and
very
reminiscent
of
a
certain
sour
cherry
juice
i
grew
up
with
finishes
with
a
touch
of
drying
almost
tanniny
experience
and
a
touch
of
barley
grains
letting
you
know
this
is
still
a
brewed
beer
overall
an
amazingly
drinkable
and
delicious
drink
that
went
perfectly
with
thanksgiving
dinner
thanks
so
much
tyler
flavor
is
thick
cherry
without
ever
feeling
like
a
cough
syrup
tastes
very
natural
albeit
concentrated
i
honestly
believe
there
are
a
pound
of
cherries
in
every
bottle
sweet
for
sure
but
it
is
a
sweetness
that
ties
it
together
almonds
show
with
room
temperature
high
carbonation
works
to
cut
through
the
sweeness
i
am
getting
quite
a
bit
of
dough
and
vanilla
touches
of
cinnamon
i
could
drink
this
for
days
before
getting
tired
but
i
do
see
an
end
of
the
tunnel
12
a
bottle
was
fine
for
tonight
just
enough
to
make
me
want
another
but
i
will
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
moreover
it
makes
me
want
to
share
it
with
friends
again
i
had
3
bottles
of
the
wbr
after
my
trip
to
madison
in
06
i
drank
them
way
too
fast
with
people
who
didnt
appreciate
the
brew
it
will
not
happen
again
poured
into
rapscallion
glass
formed
1
of
creamy
light
pink
head
over
the
murky
deeply
red
brew
head
lasts
a
novelty
for
many
fruit
beers
ive
seen
and
lacing
was
good
aroma
is
deeply
of
cherries
but
the
real
thing
not
those
sickly
sweet
maraschinos
or
anything
with
corners
rounded
with
some
malt
presence
taste
is
starts
off
with
somewhat
sweet
cherries
smooths
with
some
light
malt
input
and
then
the
curtain
rises
on
the
sour
with
none
of
the
preceding
overdone
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
just
as
i
had
hoped
for
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
one
again
sometime
for
sure
this
is
a
delightful
beer
i
think
that
it
would
be
excellent
served
as
a
dessert
beer
or
paired
with
a
nice
sharp
cheese
this
is
excellent
i
reccommend
trying
it
if
you
have
a
chance
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
the
label
tells
me
you
hold
the
marriage
of
wine
and
beer
ill
certain
give
it
that
although
these
kind
of
beers
typically
dont
appeal
to
me
its
one
of
the
better
fruitinfused
beers
that
ive
had
and
i
can
definitely
see
where
if
youre
into
this
type
of
thing
youd
probably
really
like
this
beer
the
mouth
is
also
delightful
an
almost
full
body
with
a
fine
carbonation
and
slightly
tart
puckering
ending
that
nevertheless
stays
sweet
and
satisfying
after
every
drink
truly
this
is
must
have
for
all
fruit
beer
fans
and
to
so
thoroughly
satisfy
a
guy
who
doesnt
even
particularly
like
cherries
its
just
great
this
beer
is
worth
every
bit
its
rep
will
search
this
one
out
again
i
really
want
more
my
wife
even
had
a
few
glasses
with
me
and
she
is
not
into
beer
at
all
drinkability
what
a
fruit
beer
too
heavy
for
sessioning
but
awesome
for
sharing
and
tastings
great
stuff
well
balanced
for
the
amount
of
cherries
used
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ever
much
like
the
raspberry
tart
this
is
just
a
magnificantly
made
fruit
beer
and
hugely
drinkable
despite
a
big
does
of
sweetness
that
would
indicate
it
shouldnt
be
you
wisconsinite
bastards
are
very
lucky
very
lucky
dthis
is
one
damn
fine
fruit
beer
you
had
better
like
tart
cherries
which
i
do
this
beer
balances
the
fruit
sweetness
and
sourness
perfectly
certainly
worth
a
try
i
dont
know
that
im
really
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
nicely
done
overall
i
really
do
not
have
enough
good
things
to
say
about
this
one
every
aspect
of
it
was
fantastic
and
i
would
gladly
welcome
a
steady
supply
of
it
into
my
home
it
is
one
of
those
things
that
are
perfect
for
a
special
occasion
or
just
sitting
around
watching
a
movie
truly
unique
and
in
a
world
of
its
own
these
new
glarus
beers
never
cease
to
amaze
me
i
must
start
setting
up
some
trades
for
this
one
asap
d
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
perfect
balance
of
fruity
sweetness
and
tart
sourness
taste
was
cherry
filled
sweet
sticky
phenols
make
the
cherries
feel
fake
and
syrupy
a
thick
feel
to
it
with
a
small
bite
in
the
back
to
soften
the
syrup
feel
a
good
brew
but
not
very
drinkable
to
me
very
unique
beer
and
a
lot
of
fun
to
try
but
not
something
i
would
regularly
drink
i
can
barely
identify
this
as
a
beer
similar
to
a
lambic
possibly
i
think
it
would
be
great
as
an
after
meal
drink
similar
to
a
dessert
wine
this
is
also
more
of
a
refreshing
drink
you
could
have
all
year
round
there
is
more
noticeable
lacing
as
i
consume
the
beer
i
do
not
think
i
would
want
to
consume
a
lot
of
this
at
a
time
as
the
taste
could
become
tiring
after
a
while
but
for
now
it
is
enjoyable
tasted
better
with
food
later
on
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
this
is
an
interesting
offering
if
you
like
cherries
it
is
probably
pretty
tasty
i
dont
have
a
strong
opinion
of
them
either
way
so
this
creation
it
isnt
really
beerlike
just
seems
interesting
to
me
i
will
say
that
it
does
have
a
very
real
cherry
flavor
to
it
that
is
far
from
artificial
or
medicinelike
its
well
done
just
not
for
me
d
downright
delectable
outstanding
beer
experience
this
is
a
superb
beer
its
nice
to
be
able
to
enjoy
a
full
bottle
at
home
rather
than
the
2oz
samples
ive
gotten
in
the
past
at
the
gabf
my
only
complaint
is
that
they
dont
distribute
outside
of
wisconsin
this
brew
is
well
worth
the
effort
to
acquire
i
still
this
the
size
is
too
much
for
one
person
but
i
had
my
sister
helping
me
out
with
this
one
thanks
new
glarus
for
a
lambic
to
remember
d
awesome
certainly
a
great
fruit
beer
wow
this
was
good
poured
from
a
champagne
bottle
it
has
a
garnet
color
with
a
small
slightly
pinkish
head
the
beer
is
light
in
carbonation
although
this
meshes
well
with
the
sour
and
sweet
tastes
that
are
imparted
from
the
cherries
has
a
tremendous
and
complex
cherry
taste
this
bottle
was
gone
way
too
fast
pours
a
light
pink
to
reddish
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
sour
cherries
in
the
taste
cherry
very
cherry
with
a
small
sourness
lingering
behind
a
smooth
medium
body
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
cherry
aftertaste
cherries
feel
a
bit
medicinal
kind
of
like
cough
drops
a
small
tartness
and
big
in
cherry
no
bubbles
and
hardly
any
no
head
but
the
color
is
just
a
dark
cherry
red
reminds
me
of
fruit
punch
and
wine
mixed
together
the
aroma
is
almost
a
buttery
cherry
aroma
very
unique
and
still
pretty
funky
the
taste
is
a
medium
tart
cherry
juice
a
little
odd
creaminess
somewhere
upfront
but
very
quickly
fades
strong
funky
cherry
flavors
hit
the
mddle
hard
along
with
a
slow
lasting
sweetness
drinkability
very
high
this
is
a
tasty
smooth
beer
with
a
nice
complex
fruit
flavor
not
a
beer
that
you
would
drink
several
of
but
a
good
sweet
beer
to
enjoy
after
a
meal
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
could
probably
only
do
one
of
these
every
now
and
then
any
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
would
kill
my
tastebuds
d
so
easy
to
drink
what
an
incredible
beer
best
fruit
beer
i
have
had
so
far
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
raspberry
tart
and
hopefully
the
apple
ale
2008
release
body
is
medium
and
slick
with
juice
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
beautiful
example
of
beer
bottom
line
this
is
a
world
class
brew
that
hits
my
palate
on
all
cylinders
like
i
said
before
i
got
this
in
a
trade
and
it
certainly
wont
be
the
last
time
i
trade
for
it
thank
again

pours
a
rusty
looking
murky
red
with
a
nice
pink
head
that
takes
its
time
smells
mildly
tark
the
cherries
come
out
to
play
along
with
some
sweetness
taste
is
mostly
the
sweet
cherries
mildly
tart

a
smooth

flat

the
finish

a
sipping

the
body
is
very
opaque
the
aroma
is
outstanding
sour
cherries
blast
out
of
the
glass
the
flavor
on
this
beer
is
crazy
good
good
sour
cherry
flavor
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
which
seems
to
make
the
flavor
pop
ends
on
a
pretty
sweet
note
the
body
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the
flavor
but
its
pretty
light
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
if
i
ever
get
married
ill
use
this
in
place
of
champagne
for
the
toast
d
this
was
an
excellent
after
thanksgiving
dinner
treat
this
is
a
beer
with
real
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
perhaps
too
sweet
to
drink
the
whole
750ml
bottle
at
one
time
but
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
after
the
first
few
sip
i
had
to
break
out
some
dark
chocolate
just
to
see
chocolate
covered
cherries
every
trip
to
wisconsin
will
require
at
least
one
or
two
of
these
beauties
coming
back
with
me
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
deserves
to
be
towards
the
top
of
the
list
on
the
best
of
ba
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
creamy
and
frothy
brown
head
on
top
that
remains
for
quite
a
while
with
plenty
of
lacing
along
the
side
smell
is
strong
on
cherry
and
a
cider
type
smell
fills
the
nostrils
taste
is
ridiculously
sweet
with
some
sour
tart
notes
finishing

is
filled

i
have
not
usually
liked
the
tart
wild
ales
in
the
past
this
one
finally
works
for
me
maybe
im
not
a
huge
fan
or
maybe
i
am
finally
used
to
this
hybrid
type
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
limited
a
tad
because
of
the
sweetness
factor
still
blows
most
cherry
beers
away
thanks
to
nflmvp
for
the
two
bottles
of
this
served
this
chilled
from
a
waxed
750ml

dried

one

in
a
good
way
all
strong
tart
cherries
definitely
cherry

tasting

my
opinion

a
nice
thick
full
syrupy
tongue

was
right
on
as
well
awesome
drinkability
glad
i
have
another

glarus
offering
overall
wow
thanks
himerman
for
a
great
beer
i
love
it
and
so
does
mrsostrungt
i
would
always
have
a
bottle
of
this
if
i
had
access
to
it
the
only
problem
is
that
it
might
just
be
a
bit
too
sweet

my
mouth
literally
was
watering
with
every
sip
not
exactly
a
kriek
as
its
not
nearly
that
sour
but
a
damn
fine
brew
nonetheless
sample

of
a
travelling
fellow
beer
lover
this
brew
pours
a
lustrous
brownish

with
a
medium
thick
and
fizzy
beige

that
dissipates

fruit
character
of
fresh
cherries
and
strawberries
along
with
spices
and
malts
light
wheat
and
yeast
undertones
at
times
the
finish
is
richly
fruity
and
tart
and
leaves
a
lingering
cherry
aftertaste
quite
simply
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
had
for
my
29th
birthday
i
had
48
bottles
to
give
out
to
all
my
friends
but
we
could
not
drink
them
all
4
months
later
i
have
a
12
pack
left
too
sweet
for
regular
drinking
but
very
nice
as
a
dessert
and
could
be
good
with
certain
foods
maybe
roasted
chicken
this
stuff
is
pure
cherry
juice
it
seems
less
tart
than
before
and
sweeter
about
an
inch
of
head
strong
deep
smell
of
cherry
reddish
brown
in
color
slightly
tart
no
hint
of
alcohol
cherry
pie
filling
flavor
very
good
beer
hard
to
beat
for
this
style
of
beer
a
cloudy
rich
red
color
poured
aggressively
a
full
finger
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
light
lacing
remains
the
smell
initially
came
across
to
me
as
being
very
sweet
and
similar
to
maraschino
cherry
syrup
the
aroma
really
led
me
to
think
that
what
would
follow
would
be
as
sweet
full
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
complemented
by
a
cherry
sourness
that
flows
through
the
mouth
like
a
syrup
full
flavored
the
big
cherry
taste
reminds
me
of
a
tart
cherry
pie
filling
this
is
way
too
easy
to
consume
very
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
live
where
this
is
easily
available
a
cherry
treat
d
best
fruit
beer
i
have
tasted
a
great
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
reddish
orange
in
color
a
little
lighter
at
the
bottom
very
opaque
the
head
is
about
12
inch
thick
light
tan
color
it
falls
quickly
leaving
decent
lacing
behind
the
major
scents
here
are
cherry
and
cinnamon
there
is
also
oak
and
sugar
with
a
deep
spice
character
the
taste
is
much
the
same
cherry
and
oak
sherry
hops
sugarymalt
fruit
juice
tangy
with
bits
of
citrus
highly
carbonated
but
incredibly
smooth
and
balanced
slightly
syrupy
dry
finish
this
is
so
freaking
good
easy
to
drink
wonderful
but
not
an
everyday
thing
by
any
means
overall
i
have
come
across
many
beers
that
i
love
westy
12
and
ky
stout
most
notably
this
one
here
is
a
whole
different
matter
its
pure
sex
in
a
bottle
i
love
this
beer
the
aroma
the
flavor
the
enjoyablity
is
off
the
scale
new
glarus
you
rule
stylistically
very
well
done
compared
to
other
fruit
beers
ive
tried
unfortunately
not
to
my
taste
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
though
thanks
jrdegriselles
for
the
opportunity
and
to
schmittymack
for
the
chance
to
revisit
its
a
bright
red
beer
with
a
nice
pink
head
that
doesnt
stick
or
lace
but
doesnt
dissipate
that
quickly
the
aromas
of
straight
up
cherries
hit
the
nose
right
from
the
start
the
phenols
from
the
yeast
and
fruit
are
blended
in
there
but
make
it
rather
nice
the
taste
of
cherries
is
really
strong
and
sweet
but
balanced
out
by
a
slight
bitterness
there
really
isnt
any
malt
to
speak
of
since
there
are
a
pound
of
cherries
in
each
bottle
the
mouth
feel
has
a
certain
fullness
to
it
but
goes
well
with
style
of
beer
all
in
all
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
very
sweet
but
a
very
tasty
sweet
yes
yes
i
love
it
bong
bridge
wisconsinites
are
lucky
lucky
lucky
its
color
was
not
as
pleasant
as
i
expected
more
of
a
red
brown
than
a
brilliant
ripefruit
red
and
aroma
was
just
soso
but
that
flavor
was
a
big
punch
of
flavor
that
i
really
enjoyed
overall
holy
fucking
cherries
im
happy
i
shared
this
with
semi
knowledgeable
beer
friends
because
it
was
great
but
also
theres
no
way
i
could
have
drank
a
whole
bottle
its
just
too
much
cherries
one
glass
is
a
great
treat
though
cherries
d
this
was
really
good
i
generally
have
not
enjoyed
many
cherry
brews
but
this
was
quite
good
it
even
reminded
me
of
a
sparkling
cider
d
buy
this
buy
a
case
of
it
ages
well
and
i
doubt
many
people
will
not
like
it
i
couldnt
put
this
one
down
there
was
sooo
much
flavor
to
this
beer
that
i
couldnt
wait
for
the
next
sip
to
try
and
figure
everything
out
a
wonderful
beverage
but
i
struggle
a
little
to
rate
this
because
it
really
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
beerlike
qualities
it
takes
a
pretty
vigorous
pour
to
get
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
a
hedonistic
cherry
immersion
and
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
tart
fresh
delicious
malt
and
hops
are
undetectable
as
is
the
alcohol
actually
even
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
would
push
it
to
a
higher
level
for
me
recommended
definitely
but
i
do
have
to
rate
it
in
the
context
of
a
beer
drinkability
easy
drinking
sweet
beer
not
to
tart
or
sour
allmost
champagneish
this
is
a
gorgeous
beer
albiet
not
for
everyone
but
i
love
cherries
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
i
dare
someone
to
try
to
oneup
this
one
good
luck
drinkability
is
good
this
isnt
really
my
favorite
style
but
it
certainly
is
an
interesting
and
very
well
crafted
beer
d
im
using
it
now
as
a
sipping
beer
for
a
long
lazy
afternoon
and
its
great
a
dessert
beer
as
well
d
amazingly
refreshing
with
no
alcoholic
effect
thus
its
quite
drinkable
not
syrupy
or
overly
sweet
like
most
fruit
beers
a
must
try
and
something
i
would
often
return
to
were
it
more
available
i
dont
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
the
the
beer
store
had
this
one
in
the
fridge
i
just
think
im
not
a
fan
it
did
look
gorgeous
ive
never
seen
a
pink
cascading
head
before
the
aroma
however
just
reminded
me
of
juicy
juice
not
a
fine
beer
the
taste
was
a
little
more
complex
with
a
mild
tartness
and
sweet
cherry
flavor
i
really
couldnt
find
much
depth
here
id
go
back
to
the
raspberry
tart
before
this
one
pours
a
brownish
color
with
definite
red
highlights
small
ivory
head
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
flute
smell
is
incredible
like
opening
a
jar
of
fresh
cherries
very
enticing
smell
taste
is
pretty
much
like
cherry
pie
filling
with
a
lot
of
tartness
and
sourness
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
medium
body
is
nice
one
glass
is
great
but
two
glasses
is
too
much
a
nice
dessert
which
is
best
shared
with
3
friends
not
1
spouse
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
mild
carbonation
slight
slickness
a
world
class
fruit
beer
its
a
fruit
beer
so
what
it
tastes
so
good
and
is
absurdly
easy
to
drink
this
the
first
beer
that
worries
me
about
having
my
kids
get
into
and
starting
a
habit
so
good
drinkability
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
the
cherry
is
just
fantastic
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
awhile
i
would
highly
recommend
trading
for
it
a
very
well
made
and
delicious
beverage
still
it
left
me
wanting
more
something
more
mouthpuckeringly
sour
something
horseblanketly
funky
to
play
off
these
amazing
cherries
the
clear
cherry
flavor
recalled
my
enjoyment
of
drie
fonteinens
schaerbeekse
kriek
will
the
capable
ng
brewmaster
try
to
make
a
true
lambic
someday
i
certainly
hope
so
this
beauty
displays
a
thick
ruby
red
hue
with
a
thin
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
lacing
soon
after
pour
that
remains
throughout
tasting
smell
is
of
what
else
fresh
cherries
the
bottle
claims
they
use
over
a
pound
of
cherries
in
each
bottle
and
i
dont
doubt
that
for
a
second
no
alcohol
on
the
nose
at
all
scary
good
odor
a
bit
of
acidity
seems
to
tickle
the
senses
too
taste
is
once
again
of
what
else
cherries
starts
off
sweet
and
smooth
and
ends
up
tart
and
sour
i
also
detect
a
bit
of
bready
malt
in
the
flavor
which
helps
balance
some
of
the
acidity
i
think
this
beer
tastes
better
than
any
juice
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
a
generous
amount
of
carbonation
bite
drinkability
is
pretty
good
and
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
the
acidity
got
to
me
a
bit
if
i
could
fill
a
pool
with
this
beer
and
swim
around
in
it
i
would
be
the
happiest
man
alive
i
would
be
like
scrooge
mcduck
in
ducktales
swimming
in
his
coins
well
done
new
glarus
cant
wait
for
the
raspberry
tart
i
want
to
be
buried
with
this
beer
or
the
raspberry
thatd
be
fine
too
overall
give
kudos
to
a
small
brewery
like
new
glarus
for
creating
such
an
unusual
taste
treat
it
rightly
deserves
a
place
on
ba
top
100
list
even
if
youre
not
a
fruit
beer
fan
this
one
is
well
worth
your
time
to
sample
i
strongly
suggest
giving
this
beer
a
try
even
if
fruit
beers
arent
your
personal
favorite
you
will
not
be
disappointed
another
insanely
tasty
and
well
crafted
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
i
have
no
hesitations
calling
this
and
their
raspberry
tart
two
of
the
best
beers
overall
not
just
fruit
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
they
are
remarkably
well
made
and
so
damn
pleasing
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
some
carbonation
nice
litty
fizzy
head
basically
no
lacing
at
all
the
nose
is
of
malts
cherries
tangyness
and
slight
spices
maybe
some
caramel
the
taste
is
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
nice
tangysweet
bite
with
lots
of
cherries
thrown
in
slight
cinimmon
very
tasty
thirst
quenching
brew
medium
body
a
nice
complex
brew
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
one
highly
recommended
i
love
this
stuff
i
could
drink
it
every
damn
day
all
damn
day
its
damned
delightful
o
i
must
say
the
syrupy
stickiness
is
a
bit
too
overpowering
and
the
malt
a
bit
too
underpowering
for
my
tastes
i
have
real
trouble
trying
to
figure
out
how
this
ends
up
as
the
best
beer
in
wi
according
to
reviewers
on
this
site
overall
i
think
this
has
much
more
in
common
with
soda
or
sweet
champagne
than
it
does
beer
and
thats
probably
why
it
gets
such
great
reviews
everyone
loves
pop
im
not
a
big
fan
so
i
dont
think
this
floats
my
boat
as
much
as
the
next
geek
however
it
does
have
an
amazing
affinity
for
food
and
approached
from
that
standpoint
i
find
it
to
be
quite
useful
and
amazing
either
way
its
certainly
an
interesting
brew
and
still
leagues
beyond
most
ridiculous
attempts
at
this
style
thanks
for
sharing
this
viggo
this
pretty
much
looks
like
a
bottle
of
wine
and
the
whole
red
wax
seal
thing
was
kind
of
interesting
poured
a
cloudy
redish
orange
brown
kind
of
the
color
of
rust
pretty
big
fruity
smell
mostly
of
cherries
and
maybe
a
little
hint
of
citrus
what
little
head
there
was
dissipated
very
quickly
very
lively
on
the
tongue
both
sweet
and
tart
with
a
nice
cherry
fruit
taste
be
sure
to
lick
your
lips
after
taking
a
drink
of
this
one
because
the
taste
youll
find
there
is
delicious
carbonation
was
just
right
and
the
balance
was
perfect
with
the
tartness
offsetting
the
sweetness
not
sure
i
detected
much
hop
flavor
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
is
good
with
such
a
huge
bottle
pours
a
very
murky
redbrown
thick
off
white
head
forms
settles
down
to
a
think
layer
and
ring
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
amazing
rich
real
cherries
very
earthy
toffee
brown
sugar
nice
sourness
from
the
cherries
quite
amazing
taste
is
cherry
cake
toffee
nice
sour
cherries
through
the
middle
spices
some
ginger
more
cherries
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
very
thick
silky
smooth
low
carbonation
fucking
amazing
beer
just
insane
i
cant
wait
to
try
again
thanks
scott
i
owe
you
for
this
one
this
beer
is
just
a
complete
treat
to
drink
if
only
it
was
available
in
ohio
new
glarus
has
a
complete
knockout
here
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
cheers
wow
this
is
a
fantastic
fruit
beer
once
i
got
started
on
the
bottle
i
couldnt
stop
until
it
was
finished
truly
a
pleasure
not
a
daily
drinker
but
certainly
one
to
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
ive
never
tried
anything
that
i
could
even
remotely
suggest
as
a
substitute
cheers
thanks
to
my
blond
friend
sarah
for
bringing
this
to
me
from
a
trip
home
to
cheeseland
recently
poured
out
a
brownish
red
bricklike
color
with
a
small
segregated
chunky
greyish
pink
head
the
nose
is
cherry
sour
more
cherry
a
little
bit
of
cherry
some
sour
cherry
some
ripe
cherry
some
fruit
punch
some
super
concentrated
cherry
you
get
the
idea
the
taste
was
better
balanced
but
still
hit
you
over
the
head
fruity
cherry
this
is
more
like
sucking
on
cherry
pits
with
just
a
little
cherry
meat
left
not
exceptionally
complex
on
the
palate
but
really
fun
to
drink
has
a
slightly
prickly
mouthfeel
and
finishes
exceptionally
smooth
and
fairly
clean
tremendously
drinkable
d
i
think
that
one
dinner
bottle
of
this
is
enough
the
sweetness
is
pleasant
in
small
doses
but
could
easily
overpower
the
taste
buds
the
bitternesssourness
in
there
makes
it
easier
than
most
sweet
beers
quite
easy
to
drink
poured
from
the
750ml
bottle
into
a
st
bernardus
goblet
body
is
a
strange
opaque
pinkbrown
hybrid
with
just
a
few
wisps
of
creamy
white
head
very
sweet
aroma
of
cherries
cherries
and
more
cherries
with
maybe
some
confectioners
sugar
mixed
in
palate
is
again
thoroughly
dominated
by
sweet
cherries
this
almost
comes
across
like
a
soda
rather
than
a
beer
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
emerges
on
the
finish
but
there
is
still
plenty
of
residual
sweetness
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
which
does
provide
a
little
bit
of
an
indication
that
this
isnt
in
fact
soda
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
in
large
quantities
but
still
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
brew
d
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
just
not
sure
i
could
ever
handle
more
than
one
which
sounds
like
it
might
contradict
my
high
taste
ranking
im
liking
the
juicy
sourness
but
the
fruit
is
more
than
im
used
to
that
being
said
its
still
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
d
quite
probably
the
most
enjoyable
beer
i
have
had
to
date
gave
my
parents
a
try
and
neither
of
them
who
really
cares
for
beer
both
said
that
1
they
would
go
out
and
buy
i
know
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
to
get
more
of
this
i
will
stock
up
this
beer
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
especially
if
you
enjoy
cherries
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
the
bottle
has
a
wax
seal
on
top
and
the
label
has
a
story
about
the
beer
and
the
cherries
in
it
the
color
is
a
cloudy
ruby
color
wife
called
it
blood
plasma
it
had
a
small
head
and
tons
of
initial
carbonation
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
heavy
on
cherries
obviously
and
also
had
a
noticeable
wine
smell
the
mouthfeel
was
mild
and
went
down
smooth
with
just
the
right
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
taste
was
amazing
it
had
the
expected
cherry
taste
but
was
perfectly
balanced
to
not
be
overpowering
granted
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
and
not
all
the
time
but
having
this
every
couple
months
would
be
perfect
highly
recommend
unless
you
dont
like
cherry
4
5
hr
t
y
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
but
i
could
not
drink
a
lot
of
it
bottle
sampled
with
rudge75
and
my
friend
reid
dark
red
in
colour
with
hints
of
brown
low
to
medium
carbonation
huge
sweet
cherry
aroma
with
additional
notes
of
vanilla
and
some
pale
barley
malt
very
large
in
the
mouth
with
the
cherries
obviously
taking
centre
stage
along
with
a
bit
of
other
red
berry
fruit
as
sweet
as
it
is
there
are
more
dimensions
than
sweet
fruit
to
this
beer
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
earth
its
smooth
on
the
palate
yet
theres
enough
earthy
bitterness
to
keep
things
in
check
not
something
you
could
knock
back
a
lot
of
but
this
is
one
heck
of
a
dessert
beer
the
beer
pours
out
with
a
white
head
that
falls
right
away
the
deep
red
color
is
cloudy
and
very
inviting
the
smell
is
slightly
tart
but
very
fruity
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
cherries
just
wonderful
stuff
i
have
had
at
least
6
bottles
of
this
beer
and
it
never
gets
old
the
aftertaste
is
of
slight
barly
once
it
warms
up
deep
down
it
is
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
nice
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
a
lot
of
it
served
into
a
champagne
flute
poured
a
murky
red
color
slight
head
and
lacing
smell
is
hard
to
describle
kind
of
a
musty
sweet
smell
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
it
met
my
non
expectations
wow
what
a
different
flavour
huge
cherries
with
a
really
sour
finish
but
yet
sweet
at
the
same
time
the
sweetness
seems
to
be
like
a
honey
flavour
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
im
not
a
huge
cherry
so
the
flavour
of
this
beer
is
probably
wasted
on
me
i
due
to
have
to
give
credit
for
an
awesome
effort
and
a
very
complex
brew
i
am
very
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
but
probably
a
one
time
try
final
verdict
on
this
one
is
that
although
its
a
delightful
brew
and
would
be
a
great
afterdinner
beer
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
my
half
of
the
bottle
because
as
with
most
fruit
beers
they
give
me
some
nasty
heartburn
that
said
dont
let
it
stop
you
from
trying
this
one
just
share
the
bottle
with
a
few
friends
after
dinner
you
dont
need
more
than
one
glass
this
is
a
perfect
afterdinner
or
dessert
drink
i
could
also
see
serving
this
as
a
wine
substitute
during
a
traditional
thanksgiving
dinner
this
is
the
best
fruit
ale
ive
ever
tasted
but
its
certainly
no
session
beer
surprise
this
beer
rocks
from
pour
to
taste
it
is
an
unadulterated
incredibly
balanced
beer
which
screams
real
cherries
used
i
felt
as
though
i
might
actually
be
snacking
on
a
ripe
fresh
from
the
tree
bowl
of
cherries
best
of
all
this
is
done
in
a
very
complimentary
beer
and
yeast
combination
no
worst
case
no
fruit
cooler
here
just
a
wonderful
blend
of
malt
yeast
and
cherries
enjoy
if
you
can
get
it
served
in
my
lindemans
flute
pours
very
murkey
and
muddy
orangyred
with
a
tightly
bubbled
creamy
pinkish
head
you
can
smell
the
tartness
and
acidity
of
the
cherries
very
nice
some
yeastiness
absolutly
spectacular
flavor
sweet
up
front
tart
at
the
end
slight
drying
affect
full
luscious
body
lively
carbonation
i
bet
i
could
get
in
a
lot
of
knickers
with
this
beer
many
thanks
to
faro
for
sending
me
this
bottle
in
our
trade
earlier
this
fall
murky
scarlet
almost
like
watereddown
blood
with
a
thin
duskypink
foam
cap
the
aroma
is
almost
an
exact
sensory
replica
of
the
scent
one
detects
when
opening
a
can
of
naturally
sweetened
i
e
without
high
fructose
corn
syrup
or
any
other
goo
organic
cherries
pure
fruit
thick
pulpy
skinsandall
theres
a
hint
of
tartness
too
so
its
not
all
just
a
sicklysweet
mess
of
fruit
the
flavor
is
more
of
what
the
aroma
foretells
thick
chewy
cherry
pulp
intensely
sweet
but
not
syrupy
with
a
tart
dry
edge
at
the
finish
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
grain
flavor
perhaps
only
a
little
funky
tartness
from
the
wheat
malt
a
small
and
indistinct
spice
note
weaves
in
and
out
of
the
middle
as
well
sort
of
like
faint
cinnamon
dry
and
tart
on
the
palate
not
too
puckery
but
the
intense
sweetness
is
all
fruit
and
no
residual
sugar
syrupy
crap
i
dont
know
that
a
cherryflavored
beer
that
isnt
a
lambic
could
be
done
any
better
than
this
very
nicely
done
fruit
beer
and
very
special
beer
generally
speaking
this
paired
quite
well
with
the
vegan
chocolate
mousse
i
had
for
dessert
tonight
my
wife
didnt
like
it
too
well
but
shes
a
hophead
the
thing
i
love
most
about
this
brew
is
that
it
is
subtle
and
delicious
without
being
overthetop
or
too
pretentious
yeah
its
brewed
with
a
whole
lot
of
real
cherries
but
the
fruit
is
used
to
accentuate
the
beer
rather
than
to
overpower
it
perfect
blend
of
beer
and
fruit
and
by
far
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
tried
medium
bodied
fairly
thick
for
what
i
was
expecting
nice
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
bubbly
incredibly
easy
drinking
like
i
said
earlier
like
drinking
cherry
koolaid
truely
an
exceptional
beer
experience
a
750ml
bottle
i
picked
up
during
one
of
my
many
runs
over
to
wisconsin
this
was
a
definatly
great
beer
that
i
think
my
beer
hating
girlfriend
actually
enjoyed
it
poured
a
ruby
red
juice
like
color
into
the
glass
a
very
small
developed
but
soon
turned
to
film
the
beer
smells
of
cherries
naturally
but
it
is
very
sweet
and
tart
even
smells
borderline
oak
tastes
of
huge
cherry
flavor
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
tartness
there
is
nothing
to
complain
about
here
this
is
a
very
nice
quality
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
all
drinkability
youre
not
exactly
going
to
drink
this
down
fast
to
be
served
in
small
doses
definetely
a
beer
for
nonbeer
people
and
the
big
fruit
beer
fans
holy
grail
just
not
for
me
more
like
drinking
a
fruit
juice
or
drinking
a
liquid
cherry
pie
than
like
drinking
any
other
fruit
beer
huge
cherry
flavor
and
aroma
only
very
slightly
sour
nice
deep
rich
red
color
very
very
drinkable
the
perfect
beer
to
give
to
a
girl
who
says
that
they
dont
like
beer
but
why
bother
wasting
such
a
good
beer
on
a
girl
that
you
shouldnt
be
going
out
with
in
the
first
place
this
is
a
good
one
to
spring
on
someone
who
is
not
expecting
to
like
it
my
wife
usually
doesnt
go
for
beer
she
was
happy
with
this
try
it
because
it
is
different
because
it
is
delicious
pair
it
with
dessert
drink
it
one
special
ocassions
like
birthdays
mmm
i
could
drink
an
entire
750
of
this
and
that
is
saying
quite
a
bit
for
its
drinkability
considering
how
much
i
usually
dislike
fruit
beer
but
when
done
well
they
are
great
on
the
palate
it
is
very
similar
to
the
usual
kriek
counterpart
but
this
one
is
more
cherryfresh
tasting
the
cherry
component
is
just
more
ripe
very
good
medium
bodied
nice
dry
refreshing
finish
not
syrupy
or
watery
just
right
this
aint
no
koolaid
very
drinkable
provided
you
wanted
a
cherry
bomb
i
thought
i
would
get
sick
of
the
cherry
taste
but
i
wanted
more
maybe
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
ive
had
this
bottle
sitting
around
since
my
trip
to
madison
over
a
month
ago
finally
decided
to
crack
it
open
tonight
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
new
glarus
has
certainly
produced
a
beer
like
no
other
beer
im
familiar
with
great
beer
for
something
different
and
i
cant
imagine
a
better
example
of
the
style
well
worth
any
trouble
you
have
getting
your
hands
on
this
one
great
nose
great
taste
but
so
much
so
that
its
hard
to
say
more
than
one
full
glass
is
possible
ill
certainly
look
for
this
again
for
dessert
notes
this
is
a
great
beer
because
my
girlfriend
also
like
it
who
at
other
times
usally
described
beers
as
too
beer
tasting
not
that
i
ever
understood
that
so
its
worth
a
try
unless
of
course
you
hate
cherry
then
dont
bother
yowsa
so
sweet
that
it
is
best
enjoyed
in
moderation
i
will
keep
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
around
to
haul
out
after
dinner
now
and
then
or
as
a
trap
to
snag
the
but
i
dont
like
beer
people
its
good
for
its
style
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
mouthfell
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
the
beer
has
a
bit
of
acidity
that
aides
in
drinkability
this
was
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
couldnt
see
sessioning
this
beer
if
you
find
your
self
in
wisconsin
make
sure
to
find
some
of
this
beer
one
of
the
true
greats
brewed
in
the
us
i
have
had
it
4
or
5
times
always
in
a
750ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
at
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
fantastic
cherry
aroma
this
is
a
beer
that
deserves
to
be
served
in
a
large
snifter
style
glass
or
something
similar
to
a
wine
glass
did
i
mention
the
aroma
very
tart
cherry
flavor
that
you
will
want
to
sip
and
savor
the
flavor
is
not
at
all
sweet
as
some
might
expect
when
they
see
the
cherry
on
the
label
this
isnt
an
everyday
beer
and
it
definitely
isnt
a
session
beer
this
is
something
that
is
great
for
a
nice
meal
or
after
dinner
if
you
are
into
fruit
beers
at
all
this
one
is
a
must
even
if
you
are
not
you
should
find
enough
in
this
brew
to
at
least
be
impressed
with
its
creators
a
delicious
dessert
drink
the
only
thing
that
affects
the
drinkability
for
me
is
that
it
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
well
maybe
two
or
three
but
definitely
no
more
than
that
definitely
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
edit
12307
well
thanks
to
nflmvp
i
got
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
divine
nectar
and
it
is
even
more
amazing
than
i
remember
if
you
do
not
live
in
the
wisconsin
area
contact
a
ba
from
round
there
and
trade
for
some
of
this
it
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
try
nflmvp
he
always
seems
to
be
up
for
a
trade

another
bottle
fuckin
asimply
great
outstanding
flavor
and
body
move
me
to
wi
i
cant
drink
too
many
fruit
beers
but
if
i
had
to
this
would
be
the
one
light
mouthfeel
with
a
light
carbonation
powerfully
sweet
cherry
taste
impressive
that
they
can
get
this
much
sweet
cherry
flavor
without
any
syrup
or
extract
just
cherries
and
beer
light
feel
avoids
any
cloying
and
even
the
big
bottle
was
gone
pretty
quickly
an
impressive
brew
even
if
it
doesnt
quite
match
my
tastes
with
no
hints
of
alcohol
malt
or
hops
id
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
more
beerlike
champagne
bottle
brought
back
from
wi
for
our
anniversary
thick
brownish
red
and
opaque
nice
head
turns
creamy
after
a
couple
of
minutes
smells
like
cherries
and
wine
tastes
like
a
liquid
cherry
pie
not
very
beery
but
some
malt
can
be
picked
up
on
the
finish
texture
of
liquified
fruit
with
heavy
carbonation
very
nice
overall
best
of
the
best
as
fruit
beers
go
i
would
say
new
glarus
has
the
type
down
well
what
with
raspberry
tart
on
their
menu
as
well
well
this
is
official
not
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
far
too
sweet
and
sour
this
is
something
like
over
sweetened
kool
aid
with
tobacco
thrown
in
it
not
recommended
d
this
is
a
dessert
in
a
bottle
sip
it
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
good
but
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
this
nice
i
am
blown
away
and
cant
wait
to
try
some
other
things
from
new
glarus
d
this
beer
is
big
fruit
but
it
has
a
great
amount
of
depth
to
the
cherry
flavor
the
fruit
is
not
to
tart
and
not
sweet
at
all
they
have
a
really
great
balance
of
sugars
and
a
good
depth
of
complexity
very
nice
beer
d
perfect
balance
of
sweet
sour
and
tart
friggin
amazing
it
is
amazing
that
anyone
could
capture
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
the
beer
is
ruby
red
in
the
glass
with
a
smallish
white
head
the
smell
is
purely
cherry
like
pie
filling
or
marachino
sp
cherries
an
amazing
smell
for
a
legitamate
beer
i
absolutley
love
it
the
taste
is
largely
sweet
and
quite
tart
in
the
finish
possibly
some
slight
hops
in
there
but
mostly
just
cherries
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
and
good
very
nice
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
one
try
it
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
is
damn
fine
at
that
drink
it
after
a
big
meal
and
you
cannot
help
but
be
satisfied
uf
its
basically
a
desert
every
bit
as
full
thick
and
rich
as
a
framboise
and
must
be
sipped
like
one
the
tart
aromas
become
mouthpuckering
immediately
sweet
cherry
scents
come
across
as
vigorously
as
a
yankee
candle
flavors
are
intese
cherries
thats
it
its
basically
cherry
puree
maybe
with
a
little
belgian
beer
to
thin
it
down
to
a
drinkable
level
all
the
flavors
are
worthy
of
a
5
rating
i
just
wish
there
were
bigger
beer
flavors
in
there
to
ease
the
drinkability
very
full
and
rich
on
the
palate
another
savoury
brew
finishes
very
sweet
and
tart
great
taste
just
less
beerlike
than
i
wanted
muddy
reddish
body
with
a
whispy
white
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
cherries
some
sour
notes
as
well
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
a
touch
sour
cheeries
vanilla
caramel
and
a
hint
of
lemons
when
the
beer
is
allowed
to
warm
up
a
hint
of
chocolate
begins
to
comes
through
champange
mouthfeel
light
and
lively
very
tasty
but
a
good
one
to
split
with
a
friend
pours
muddy
brown
in
color
with
hints
of
red
and
orange
very
murky
and
opaque
mmm
smells
like
a
freshly
baked
cherry
pie
damn
i
can
almost
smell
the
crust
too
sweet
cherry
jam
and
lemongreen
apple
tartness
aromas
in
there
too
taste
is
like
a
sweet
cherryapple
cider
with
a
tart
finish
effervescenttingling
on
the
tongue
carbonated
like
a
sparkling
wine
high
points
for
uniqueness
and
although
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
back
to
back
for
the
fruitiness
this
beer
is
quite
the
experience
and
and
an
incredible
fruit
beer
thanks
again
go
to
badbeer
for
the
bottle
though
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
on
one
sitting
its
so
delicious
i
wanted
to
gulp
it
down
lest
it
should
disappear
before
i
could
finish
it
a
tremendously
tasty
treat
overall
impression
burp
wow
thats
good
my
wife
loved
it
as
well
great
beer
great
drinking
big
props
to
goldorak
who
graciously
brought
this
one
out
from
his
cellar
strongly
recommended
wish
it
was
available
in
texas
d
not
an
everyday
beer
of
course
but
very
good
the
cherry
flavor
isnt
obnoxious
like
in
some
fruit
beers
but
rather
you
get
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
highly
recommended
due
to
the
sweetness
im
glad
my
girlfriend
was
willing
to
drink
the
other
half
a
whole
750ml
may
be
too
much
at
one
time
amazing
beer
bright
hazy
reddish
color
very
small
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
very
little
lacing
looks
like
some
kind
of
fruit
juice
fantastic
smell
smells
exactly
like
fresh
cherry
pie
filling
yummy
i
cant
believe
this
is
beer
very
sweet
and
tart
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
light
and
slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
my
first
offering
from
new
glarus
and
the
best
fruit
ive
tried
so
far
only
available
in
wisconsin
so
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
this
beer
you
will
not
be
disappointed
reddishbrown
in
color
i
take
a
whiff
wow
cherry
smells
like
delicious
freshbaked
cherry
pie
big
time
oh
and
the
flavor
stunningly
delicious
tastes
like
the
most
wonderful
homemade
cherry
pie
filling
with
the
slightest
hint
of
spice
can
cherry
beer
or
any
fruit
beer
for
that
matter
possibly
taste
any
better
than
this
oh
i
surely
would
bet
not
this
beer
is
so
smooth
and
lusciously
drinkable
simply
remarkable
initial
the
taste
is
sweet
cherry
this
soon
gives
way
to
sour
cherry
delicious
and
more
complex
than
i
can
adequately
describe
malt
is
there
but
completely
blends
in
with
the
cherries
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lively
the
bubbles
are
tiny
i
believe
this
qualifies
as
a
session
beer
under
ba
guidelines
if
only
i
had
another
one
or
ten
or
so
id
drink
them
all
now
pours
like
champagne
into
flute
murky
red
liquid
topped
by
a
quickly
disappearing
thick
rose
head
no
lacing
cherry
aroma
duh
not
too
overpowering
glad
to
see
this
so
often
the
aroma
in
fruit
beers
is
too
much
taste
was
fruity
with
yeasty
finish
moves
between
sweet
and
sour
while
on
the
tongue
cherry
pie
in
a
bottle
a
grand
and
glorious
fruit
beer
notes
cannot
describe
my
complete
disgust
with
this
beer
ive
tasted
it
several
times
and
i
am
still
flabbergasted
that
people
actualy
enjoy
it
i
cant
stand
the
sweetness
and
i
dont
want
to
taste
pie
crust
in
a
fruit
beer
i
do
love
the
raspberry
tart
though
but
that
is
very
balanced
and
succulent
i
wasnt
sure
about
the
drinkablility
at
first
but
nearing
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
surely
ready
for
another
excellent
ohh
my
god
that
is
the
best
smell
in
the
world
rich
ripe
sweet
cherries
and
cherry
puree
it
smells
like
the
filling
of
an
expensively
made
cherry
pastry
its
just
fantastic
smelling
thats
all
that
can
be
said
faded
pinklight
red
in
color
with
a
thin
white
film
of
a
head
jeez
this
brewery
makes
increndible
fruit
beers
fore
is
full
of
cherry
spritzy
carbonation
mild
acidic
citric
notes
toward
the
finish
the
middle
has
ever
so
slightly
sour
notes
some
nuttiness
and
a
smooth
icing
laden
fried
flaky
sweet
dough
flavor
that
carries
into
the
finish
this
really
is
a
liquid
cherry
fritter
and
it
is
utterly
amazing
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
gets
you
excited
all
over
again
about
what
beer
is
and
can
be
eagerly
anticipated
pours
rust
in
color
with
little
head
a
thin
ring
of
carbonated
foam
remains
after
a
few
minutes
aroma
is
of
cherry
juice
and
dark
red
cherries
sweetness
and
a
slight
sour
aroma
first
sip
reveals
a
slightly
acidic
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
anticipated
not
as
tart
as
a
kriek
cherry
flavor
remains
on
tongue
for
half
a
minute
after
sipping
not
thick
and
syrupy
light
on
the
tongue
easily
drinkable
thanks
to
shippos
for
trade
this
was
worth
getting
incredibly
full
wheat
body
almost
chewy
very
refreshing
i
could
literally
drink
quarts
of
this
delicious
absolutely
delicious
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
just
dripping
with
quality
and
care
theres
a
quality
here
that
makes
me
wish
there
was
a
na
version
of
this
available
to
have
with
breakfast
every
morning
i
think
ill
never
be
able
to
tolerate
fake
cherry
flavors
ever
again
this
is
hands
down
a
fantastic
beer
the
only
shortcoming
on
its
drinkability
is
the
sweetness
its
necessary
for
the
flavor
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
split
more
than
one
bottle
at
any
one
sitting

opinion
even
though
the
fruit
beers
arent
my
favorite
this
beer
goes
down
really
smooth
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
but
i
prefer
the
fruit
lambics
especially
cantillon
i
have
had
this
bottle
for
about
a
year
now
so
i
thought
that
the
sourness
would
increase
with
age
i
am
pretty
satisfied
that
isnt
the
case
so
i
will
have
to
try
a
fresher
example
next
time
pours
a
murky
brownishred
completely
opaque
and
delicious
looking
as
soon
as
the
wax
is
cut
and
the
bottle
opened
the
room
is
filled
with
luscious
cherry
a
closer
whiff
and
im
blown
away
by
the
intensity
of
fresh
fruit
cranberry
some
apple
but
obviously
cherry
takes
center
stage
the
flavor
somehow
eclipses
the
nose
in
sheer
gravity
fresh
mouthpuckering
cherry
and
cranberry
puree
with
some
subtle
hints
of
vanilla
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
velvety
indulgent
lightly
carbonated
reminded
me
of
a
fresh
door
county
cherry
cider
with
a
tart
alcoholic
bite
the
sour
and
sweetness
of
the
fruit
balance
each
other
nicely
and
make
for
an
easydrinking
desert
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
downing
a
couple
bottles
of
in
the
course
of
an
evening
it
was
hard
to
share
it
with
my
lovely
girlfriend
but
its
the
holiday
season
a
truly
magnificent
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
how
lucky
to
have
them
in
my
backyard
drinkability
outstanding
drinkability
this
is
a
really
impressive
beer
its
so
different
than
what
id
expect
in
a
beer
very
good
find
this
would
taste
fantastic
outside
on
a
crisp
autumn
day
i
plan
on
seeking
this
one
out
again
what
a
nice
tart
cherry
taste
with
this
i
could
not
get
enough
of
this
taste
and
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
the
best
part
of
this
particular
experience
was
giving
3
or
4
relatives
the
chance
of
trying
this
beer
that
they
had
never
had
before
but
now
love
too
bad
we
are
too
far
from
wisconsin
to
get
this
often
thank
god
i
have
about
5
bottles
of
this
and
the
raspberry
cellared
away
750ml
bottle
i
really
liked
this
beer
from
the
red
wax
on
the
op
to
the
very
last
drop
this
one
pours
a
definite
reddish
color
there
was
some
haziness
to
the
beer
it
pours
with
a
big
head
that
drops
to
nothing
almost
immediately
there
was
some
champagnelike
fizzy
carbonation
that
continued
throughout
the
nose
is
somewhat
like
a
cherry
pie
just
not
as
sweet
it
was
sweet
sour
and
tart
all
at
the
same
time
the
taste
was
really
nice
cherries
were
the
main
component
they
were
somewhat
tart
with
some
sweetness
at
the
same
time
something
of
a
medium
malt
body
hiding
back
there
very
nice
drinkability
since
it
is
so
sweet
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
a
few
glasses
of
this
but
what
a
pleasure
to
savor
slowly
after
dinner
i
will
definitely
buy
more
when
i
return
to
wisconsin
for
the
holidays
drinkability
was
great
we
intended
to
share
a
bottle
then
move
on
to
something
else
but
finished
both
of
the
bottles
i
had
and
could
have
emptied
another
if
it
had
been
there
this
beer
poured
a
dark
dirty
cherry
color
it
doesnt
look
exactly
like
a
fruit
beer
but
not
really
a
normal
beer
either
fizzy
white
head
medium
in
size
not
really
too
much
lacing
aroma
is
exactly
like
cherry
fruit
gushers
i
mean
its
identical
i
cant
really
get
past
it
i
like
it
but
in
my
beer
taste
once
again
has
that
cherry
fruit
gusher
quality
to
it
cherries
arent
as
tart
as
i
expected
theyre
more
sweet
and
almost
taste
fake
body
is
somewhat
thick
and
has
a
nice
fizzyness
to
it
the
first
glass
of
this
bottle
was
good
but
the
second
glass
was
tougher
started
to
get
cloying
and
too
much
cherry
reminiscent
of
cherry
juice
sorry
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
it
smells
and
tastes
distinctly
of
cherry
not
sickeningly
sweet
cherry
syrup
like
in
a
kiddie
cocktail
but
like
real
cherries
still
sweet
but
also
tart
as
a
result
the
mouthfeel
has
a
cool
puckering
effect
to
it
this
beer
isnt
very
beery
but
tastes
extremely
goodif
you
like
cherries
imho

a
great
great
beer
without
question
the
best
fruitbased
beer
you
can
get
in
america
id
take
this
over
lindemans
any
day
of
the
week
ending
in
a
y
drinkability
this
all
depends
as
previously
mentioned
on
your
tolerance
for
cherries
what
makes
this
beer
truly
great
however
is
that
you
can
share
it
with
almost
anyone
yes
the
boys
got
a
wee
nip
and
were
suitably
impressed
and
they
will
generally
enjoy
it
that
said
a
little
cherry
can
go
a
long
way
my
wife
and
i
have
done
two
of
the
750
ml
bottles
of
this
at
once
but
thats
about
all
id
do
drinkability
quite
tart
12
a
750ml
bottle
is
plenty
pours
a
rich
red
color
with
a
pinck
head
whole
lot
of
lace
lining
my
chalice
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
fruityall
cherries
thank
god
not
marachino
cherries
though
flavor
is
almost
all
cherries
but
i
am
picking
up
some
sweet
spice
as
weel
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
finish
cherries
came
across
as
pie
filling
very
sweet
and
tart
the
tartness
clung
to
the
inside
of
the
mouth
but
did
not
coat
it
with
a
scummy
feeling
mouthfeel
is
very
full
flavored
finish
is
just
slightly
dry
and
some
cinnamon
very
easy
to
drink
the
bottle
thanks
to
bieristgut
for
this
had
this
a
few
months
ago
poured
a
nice
bubble
red
with
a
pink
head
aroma
i
know
this
will
make
bieristgut
upset
and
maybe
others
but
it
smelled
like
a
wine
cooler
but
it
was
good
got
cherries
spices
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
flavor
wow
those
cherries
come
right
out
and
grab
your
taste
buds
like
a
lot
of
other
reviews
tart
cheery
pie
normally
i
am
not
into
the
high
carbonated
fruit
beers
but
this
one
was
good
this
poured
a
ruby
red
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fizzled
down
to
a
foamy
island
in
the
middle
of
my
glass
the
smell
was
an
abundance
of
cherries
smells
amazing
the
taste
is
tart
and
with
an
incredible
amount
of
cherry
flavor
there
is
also
a
light
decection
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
good
swish
it
around
a
bit
and
nurse
those
flavors
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
friends
i
highly
recommend
it
750
ml
capped
and
waxed
bottle
some
residual
sugar
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
simple
brew
nothing
special
except
well
its
totally
unique
really
nice
dessert
beer
but
it
also
maintains
a
refreshing
quality
leaving
it
as
a
summer
drink
too
so
nice
all
around
incredibly
drinkable
i
kept
coming
back
to
get
more
of
that
cherry
taste
slightly
sour
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
pinkred
color
ale
with
a
huge
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
delicate
sweet
cherries
is
enchanting
i
could
spend
hours
smelling
this
beer
taste
is
perfect
with
nice
balance
mix
between
naturally
sweet
cherries
and
malt
subtle
sourness
at
the
end
brings
everything
together
for
a
perfect
close
carbonation
is
perfect
for
a
fruit
beer
as
well
as
carbonation
and
level
of
sweetness
truly
the
best
fruit
beer
i
ever
tasted
dusty
red
with
plenty
of
foam
that
falls
to
a
pale
pink
ring
nose
is
cherry
pie
filling
or
toasted
cherry
pop
tarts
taste
is
liquid
sugary
cherry
with
some
carbonic
bite
and
a
hint
of
hops
it
is
a
beer
finish
is
acidic
from
carbonation
and
cherry
skins
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
is
certainly
drinkable
none
of
the
tart
and
funk
of
decent
lambic
here
so
it
will
appeal
more
broadly
to
most
drinkers
pour
this
into
a
footed
pilsner
glass
with
two
scoops
of
vanilla
if
you
dont
want
to
drink
it
straight
definitely
a
desert
brew
tasty
not
overly
sweet
like
lindemans
soft
more
deft
hand
at
blending
the
cherry
flavor
with
the
gentle
malt
smell
is
of
marichino
cherries
that
are
a
little
soured
with
some
maltyness
in
the
background
that
is
much
the
same
but
with
a
slightdry
sourness
in
the
finish
not
like
a
true
blended
lambic
but
i
think
the
sour
and
dryness
comes
from
the
cherries
themselves
it
has
a
decent
body
with
light
carbonation
and
it
is
very
drinkable
but
it
is
best
to
share
this
bottle
i
took
another
bas
suggestion
and
mixed
this
with
some
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
and
it
was
one
of
the
richest
and
flavorfull
beers
i
have
ever
had
finger
licking
good
striking
dark
red
appearance
just
a
bit
of
head
one
sniff
gives
away
what
this
beer
is
all
about
cherries
real
ones
and
plenty
of
them
the
flavor
is
a
wheat
beer
body
with
cherries
throughout
not
those
canned
cherries
not
cherry
juice
if
the
flavor
was
just
a
little
more
tart
and
not
quite
so
sweet
it
would
be
perfect
high
carbonation
helps
prevent
the
sweetness
from
becoming
cloying
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
dont
usually
like
fruit
beers
medium
bodied
good
drinkability
its
a
dessert
beer
not
something
you
would
base
a
session
on
wbr
seems
to
be
a
love
it
or
hate
it
kind
of
beer
i
recognize
that
though
its
beer
in
the
technical
sense
it
doesnt
much
resemble
beer
in
the
classic
sense
ive
decided
to
judge
it
on
its
own
merits
with
my
enjoyment
as
the
sole
criterion
its
hard
for
me
to
imagine
a
fruit
beer
in
general
and
a
cherry
fruit
beer
in
particular
that
is
more
delicious
than
wisconsin
belgian
red
ive
waited
quite
a
while
to
taste
this
one
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
has
exceeded
my
expectations
with
room
to
spare
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
bottle
with
us
what
a
beer
it
pours
a
bright
red
color
with
a
small
ring
of
pink
foam
around
the
top
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
as
well
very
strong
aroma
of
cherries
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
sourness
nice
the
flavor
was
unreal
lots
of
cherry
flavor
all
over
the
place
slight
tart
character
but
very
slight
love
the
flavor
of
the
cherries
in
this
one
spectacular
flavor
drinkability
is
wonderful
as
well
i
must
seek
out
more
of
this
beer
wow
my
500th
review
about
2
years
ago
i
would
have
never
guessed
that
i
would
ever
try
this
many
beers
in
my
entire
life
oh
well
heres
to
even
more
beer
i
am
forever
in
debt
to
kevin
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
brew
with
me
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
burgundy
color
with
two
fingers
of
slightly
pink
head
there
is
a
good
deal
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
very
strong
with
me
getting
my
first
whiff
with
the
glass
about
5
feet
from
my
nose
strong
notes
of
maraschino
cherry
juice
one
of
my
faves
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
sourness
amazing
the
taste
is
full
of
cherry
as
well
and
just
a
bit
of
tart
flavors
going
on
its
very
sweet
as
well
i
enjoy
it
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
strong
and
smooth
for
a
fruit
beer
the
drinkability
is
superb
i
could
surely
drink
a
few
bottles
easily
a
remarkable
drink
a
wierd
beer
reviewed
from
notes
of
a
750ml
bottle
sampled
on
11505
the
bottle
was
dipped
in
red
wax
about
an
inch
of
light
red
head
formed
over
the
murky
dark
red
body
some
lacing
was
left
as
the
head
stayed
in
tact
strong
cherry
aroma
hits
you
first
with
a
bit
of
tartness
backing
it
there
is
a
slight
malty
sweetness
lingering
in
the
back
as
well
a
sweet
tart
like
flavor
hits
the
palate
first
before
all
the
cherry
flavor
rushes
in
the
cherry
flavor
is
great
in
that
tastes
like
real
cherries
not
sweetened
cherry
juice
or
something
artificial
a
good
amount
of
tartness
that
lingers
for
bit
rounds
this
one
out
about
a
medium
body
to
it
with
an
effervescent
feel
to
it
pretty
much
what
you
would
hope
for
with
the
style
this
stuff
is
hugely
drinkable
with
the
tartness
being
very
present
but
not
overpowering
and
the
other
flavors
complementing
each
other
so
well
this
would
be
a
regular
for
me
if
it
was
local
thanks
for
the
bottle
slander
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
by
far
the
best
cherry
beer
that
ive
tried
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
up
a
chance
to
try
it
again
edit
i
still
love
this
beer
so
good
so
balanced
a
fine
beer
symmetry
oh
my
goodness
is
this
fruit
beer
balanced
clear
soda
red
with
a
thin
cap
of
khakipink
foam
powerful
aromas
of
cherry
on
the
branch
then
some
blossoms
and
finally
a
bushel
full
of
aged
and
macerated
fruit
the
taste
is
sublime
with
a
perfect
blend
of
malt
fruit
acid
and
bitter
yeah
its
sweet
but
in
no
way
cloying
as
the
tart
and
bubbles
wash
all
that
off
your
buds
before
it
gets
a
chance
to
negatively
root
and
then
there
is
even
a
slight
lingering
bitter
finish
and
the
pull
to
renew
im
not
sure
what
critics
of
this
beer
think
it
should
be
but
i
think
its
damn
near
perfect
in
its
current
form
worth
seeking
out
by
travel
or
trade
again
i
must
thank
clark
for
bringing
this
in
this
beer
pours
more
of
an
auburn
in
color
tan
a
red
which
youd
expect
from
a
beer
with
cherries
on
the
label
and
an
whitish
head
the
aroma
is
all
cherry
fruit
roll
up
as
one
taster
put
it
and
a
slight
tartness
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
little
to
no
malt
flavor
and
then
some
tartness
this
has
some
body
to
it
but
there
is
a
little
harshness
in
the
finish
overall
for
a
belgian
style
it
is
very
drinkable
if
you
like
sweet
beers
this
is
a
truely
an
amazing
beer
it
pours
a
dark
color
with
red
hints
of
the
cherries
contained
within
the
beverage
the
head
was
more
than
descent
and
lasted
long
enough
to
enjoy
the
smell
was
an
olfactory
delight
yum
the
taste
was
absolutely
amazing
first
thoughts
are
of
fresh
homemade
cherry
pie
while
rather
pleasantly
strong
the
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
with
friends
after
a
nice
meal
enjoy
drinkability
i
finished
all
750
ml
of
the
bottle
and
it
was
great
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
if
you
know
about
lambics
and
belgian
beers
youll
appreciate
this
all
the
more
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
this
is
certainly
an
odd
beer
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
one
even
im
sharing
the
bottle
with
family
because
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
alone
nevertheless
this
is
quite
tasty
certainly
the
bridge
between
beer
and
wine
not
much
more
needs
to
be
said
about
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
its
easily
and
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
cherry
beers
in
the
world
it
reeks
of
cherries
it
tastes
like
cherries
it
is
cherries
a
pound
per
bottle
in
fact
and
its
completely
authentic
there
are
no
extract
flavors
here
its
rich
and
sweet
and
somewhat
tart
and
unlike
some
other
examples
ie
gluhkriek
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
or
too
fullbodied
to
be
enjoyed
as
anything
more
than
a
dessert
beer
excellent
its
really
amazing
that
this
is
beer
it
tastes
almost
exactly
like
liquid
cherry
pie
while
not
the
deepest
beer
it
certainly
does
have
appeal
and
character
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
it
again
theres
certainly
no
way
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
but
id
immediately
think
of
it
when
introducing
people
to
the
world
of
beer
id
bet
itd
turn
a
few
people
into
good
beer
thanks
to
chip
faernt
for
the
chance
to
try
this
long
sought
after
gem
it
was
as
good
as
i
had
expected
thanks
to
trbeer
for
this
gem
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
rounded
what
a
beer
big
bottle
with
wax
opening
into
a
champagne
flute
with
the
aroma
of
door
county
a
pie
crust
colored
head
appears
and
grows
to
colossal
size
on
top
of
a
slightly
brownish
red
body
that
looks
like
cherry
jelly
the
taste
is
sweet
and
then
tart
bringing
me
back
to
chopped
cherry
preserves
on
toast
its
like
breakfast
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
but
if
it
were
heavier
the
jelly
thing
would
take
over
the
experience
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
like
fruit
beer
much
but
this
is
always
on
hand
poured
a
copper
amber
color
with
a
small
slightly
off
white
head
and
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
fresh
cherries
taste
is
sour
cherries
alittle
yeast
but
the
cherries
are
extremely
fresh
this
was
not
sickly
sweet
artificial
syrup
taste
hey
i
may
need
another
one
of
these
notes
excellent
almost
perfect
smooth
rich
and
bold
in
the
mouth
id
call
it
a
mediumlight
body
goes
down
easy
probably
too
easy
try
and
drink
one
alone
and
youll
feel
sorry
and
lonely
a
top
of
the
line
fruit
beer
who
definately
deserves
its
reputation
pair
it
with
a
nice
chocolate
dessert
or
another
rich
sweet
but
id
say
having
it
with
cherry
pie
would
be
going
overboard
the
beer
itself
is
quite
sweet
and
refreshing
though
reasonably
viscous
with
a
medium
body
as
a
beer
i
might
not
have
to
much
respect
for
this
one
but
it
is
damn
tasty
and
a
perfect
desert
beer
has
a
sour
tart
fruity
tanniccherry
stone
thing
going
on
the
aroma
is
so
intensely
cherry
it
is
quite
wonderful
i
am
gonna
have
to
say
that
this
would
be
much
better
more
authentic
if
they
had
used
a
beer
such
as
la
folie
as
the
base
beer
i
really
cant
get
over
how
intense
the
cherry
flavor
and
aroma
are
this
is
certainly
quite
an
experience
as
a
desert
it
is
a
4
6
but
unfortunately
my
biases
and
prejudices
come
into
play
bottle
8
3
years
later
asnd
just
as
good
well
this
is
very
sweet
but
damn
one
cant
help
but
help
it
and
anyone
who
hates
beer
would
love
it
just
decadent
pie
flavor
with
restrained
oakiness
my
only
complaint
severe
judging
is
that
the
acidity
could
be
more
pronounced
as
this
is
extremely
sweet
it
tasted
like
it
was
baked
spicy
with
vanilla
notes
and
a
wow
creamy
velvety
body
with
a
surprisingly
above
average
carbonation
biting
actually
legendary
beer
from
the
worlds
best
nonlambic
fruit
flavored
beers
brewer
hands
down
thanks
again
nexxus
i
like
pie
ah
yes
200
review
time
what
better
way
to
commemorate
than
with
a
top
50
brew
one
i
know
i
like
at
that
shared
this
with
my
girlfriend
sus
over
our
valentines
day
dinner
was
this
fine
concoction
a
suitable
aphrodisiac
why
yes
it
was
poured
a
muddy
ruby
red
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
smell
of
rich
fresh
sweet
and
sour
cherry
pie
just
pours
off
this
beauty
amazing
how
did
they
get
this
to
not
smell
like
cough
syrup
like
sa
cherry
wheat
taste
is
guess
what
yep
cherries
sweet
at
first
with
a
pie
crust
maltiness
sourness
kicks
in
and
finishes
nice
and
tangy
delicious
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
think
cherry
champagne
that
i
could
drink
more
often
than
i
can
afford
to
appearance
pours
a
deep
murky
ruby
red
pink
grapefruit
tone
with
a
nice
white
pink
tinted
head
leaves
nice
fine
evenly
dispersed
lacing
nice
and
intricate
aroma
a
full
on
flail
of
cherries
nice
tart
and
sweet
with
a
candy
like
tone
to
it
but
what
makes
this
is
the
creamy
edge
that
surrounds
the
fruit
bouqet
taste
a
parfait
dessert
like
tart
cherry
tone
very
sweet
and
creamy
just
so
good
i
am
by
no
means
a
fan
of
fruit
infused
ales
but
this
wisconsin
bred
cherry
beast
is
definitely
a
winner
definitely
based
off
of
legendary
belgian
style
ales
lacks
some
of
the
farmhouse
and
woody
cask
aged
flow
of
a
cantillon
but
delivers
something
a
lindemanns
isnt
capable
of
mouthfeel
a
fuller
bodied
creamy
textured
heavenly
dessert
beer
drinkability
i
just
polished
off
a
bottle
and
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
drink
it
all
but
once
i
started
sipping
on
it
the
bottle
emptied
into
my
snifter
faster
than
anticipated
it
was
excellent
not
ready
for
a
second
but
extremely
satisfied
huge
thanks
to
tavernjef
for
the
trade
wisconsin
belgian
red
was
served
from
a
wax
sealed
750
ml
bottle
into
a
champagne
flute
the
beer
was
a
lovely
orangishruby
hue
and
murky
like
fresh
unfiltered
cider
topping
this
off
was
a
fine
and
ample
whitish
head
which
left
excellent
lacing
it
looked
beautiful
in
the
champagne
glasses
the
nose
was
curious
and
seducing
with
notes
of
fresh
tart
cherries
and
cinnamon
spice
i
dont
believe
i
have
ever
experienced
such
a
marvelous
combonation
the
peak
of
enjoyment
came
with
the
flavor
the
beer
starts
with
a
massive
sweet
and
tart
cherry
bomb
hitting
the
palate
with
tingling
fizzy
delight
this
sensation
smoothly
transitions
into
a
semidry
finish
with
delicious
lingering
flavors
of
cherry
and
subtler
winey
cinnamon
all
of
this
is
perfectly
balanced
but
charged
with
life
with
perfect
carbontion
and
a
sleek
mouthfeel
the
tartness
level
was
much
lower
than
a
kriek
but
in
this
case
was
just
right
leaving
me
completely
satisfied
and
ready
to
drink
another
bottle
of
this
if
i
had
one
this
is
a
phenomenal
fruit
beer
that
completely
blew
me
away
endless
thanks
to
ngandhi
for
deliverating
this
into
my
possession
a
fine
accomplishment
from
a
fine
brewery
even
better
than
the
raspberry
tart
as
the
cherry
seems
to
fit
the
beer
much
more
simply
fantastic
and
one
id
give
to
someone
who
didnt
much
care
for
beer
thank
you
to
bighuge
for
the
bottle
murky
opaque
red
liquid
topped
by
a
moderate
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
very
much
like
cherry
pie
filling
with
a
noticeable
sweetness
taste
is
also
much
the
same
but
with
a
sharp
tartness
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
so
acidic
on
the
finish
it
tasted
more
like
strong
cherry
lemonade
at
first
even
after
40
minutes
of
sipping
on
this
i
still
get
occasional
chills
from
the
sharp
bite
on
the
finish
every
once
in
a
while
a
slight
medicinal
bitterness
comes
through
only
to
get
smacked
into
submission
by
the
sourness
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
medium
body
a
supple
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
it
seemed
to
take
me
forever
to
finish
this
beer
while
im
not
trying
to
question
the
ingredients
in
this
beer
it
just
tasted
somewhat
artificial
i
dont
know
why
but
to
me
it
just
does
its
interesting
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
cool
artisial
green
bottle
with
red
wax
seal
over
the
cap
and
neck
murky
dingy
reddishbrown
color
pink
tinged
beige
rocky
head
fades
to
a
nice
thin
sheet
over
the
beer
wow
is
right
incredible
full
fresh
cherries
earthy
stems
skins
the
whole
damn
thing
in
there
unbelievable
aromas
taste
is
tart
sweet
and
chock
full
of
fresh
cherries
liquid
cherry
pie
sweetness
shines
more
that
sour
although
there
is
a
sharp
sour
aftertaste
that
finishes
up
but
doesnt
distract
full
cherry
taste
is
every
sip
tight
full
carbaonation
medium
to
light
bodied
but
more
medium
very
good
either
as
a
refreshing
guzzler
or
a
sipper
wow
an
impressive
beer
and
a
treat
to
be
sure
thanks
to
bditty
i
think
this
is
the
last
beer
of
our
blockbuster
trade
last
year
pretty
ruby
red
color
surprisingly
long
lasting
head
cherry
vanilla
aroma
and
then
it
goes
downhill
a
taste
so
sour
you
could
never
serve
it
with
food
if
it
had
been
a
little
thinner
sour
cherry
might
work
but
this
had
a
thick
texture
maybe
if
you
pour
a
very
small
amount
you
could
work
with
this
the
color
on
the
pour
is
a
deep
black
cherry
red
with
a
brobdingnagian
sized
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
the
color
a
light
tan
tinged
with
red
and
as
it
evanesces
the
lace
forms
a
thick
and
clinging
curtain
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
that
of
ripe
cherries
and
sweet
malt
grains
tart
and
crisp
fresh
an
appealing
like
homemade
bread
fresh
from
the
oven
the
front
is
ambrosial
loaded
with
malt
the
top
rich
and
full
what
a
treat
finish
has
a
meaningful
acidity
with
the
hops
present
and
delicate
in
their
spiciness
cherry
sweetness
and
flavor
carries
to
the
somewhat
vinous
and
dry
aftertaste
what
a
hoot
and
once
as
with
lambics
i
shunned
this
style
of
beers
thankfully
ive
had
a
reclamation
and
now
see
the
errors
of
my
ways
and
thanks
to
tavernjef
another
opportunity
to
sample
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
ng
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
one
and
the
other
beers
he
helped
me
to
sample
pours
a
deep
burgundy
hue
prety
spritzy
at
first
but
the
head
dissipates
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
a
typical
belgium
kriek
upfront
theres
some
tartness
followed
by
an
intense
burst
of
real
cherry
flavor
almost
like
a
baked
cherry
cobbler
finishes
with
a
surprising
flavor
of
spiced
plums
a
really
fantastic
interpretation
of
a
classic
belgium
style
by
an
artisanal
american
brewery
looks
like
a
liquid
cherry
a
beautiful
cloudy
red
beer
with
a
pinkish
head
that
wont
give
except
for
some
lacing
smells
predominantly
of
cherries
obviously
with
some
spice
even
though
it
really
does
not
taste
like
a
beer
is
there
alcohol
in
this
if
so
you
cant
tell
it
tastes
wonderful
sour
spice
and
again
of
course
cherry
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
delicious
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
just
the
right
amount
of
time
once
its
gone
you
want
another
taste
very
drinkable
all
of
its
strong
qualities
make
it
so
but
the
fruitiness
keeps
the
drinkability
from
being
perfect
wellcarbonated
and
lively
to
start
it
loses
a
little
punch
as
you
drink
it
its
not
bad
just
different
from
its
initial
feel
what
starts
as
a
lively
lambic
feel
drifts
to
the
dutchess
which
is
hardly
a
bad
thing
just
interesting
a
mouthfull
of
red
satin
sheets
nonetheless
its
very
drinkable
its
sweetness
limits
its
drinkability
a
tiny
bit
even
for
someone
with
as
big
a
beer
sweet
tooth
as
i
have
highly
recommended
though
a
cloudy
orange
red
looking
ale
with
an
initially
towering
head
that
subsides
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
disorganized
layer
of
froth
outstanding
aroma
of
whole
cherries
with
a
touch
of
cinniman
in
the
mix
has
an
almost
full
body
witha
tart
crispness
to
it
flavor
is
sour
and
crisp
with
a
big
cherry
flavor
and
a
dry
mouth
puckering
finish
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
am
extremely
pleased
a
very
flavorful
ale
and
paired
nicely
with
my
gorgonzola
and
chicken
salad
another
great
beer
from
new
glarus
please
search
this
one
out
another
brew
that
lives
up
to
its
hype
this
kriekstyle
ale
pours
a
deep
redamber
color
with
a
frothy
sparkling
winelike
pinkish
head
very
impressive
looking
in
a
flute
glass
this
one
leaves
trails
of
lace
smell
is
tart
and
almost
acidic
at
first
with
some
true
fruity
sweetness
coming
through
thereafter
taste
is
similar
but
totally
unlike
any
belgian
kriek
ive
had
big
monstrous
cherry
notes
hit
the
palate
at
first
with
a
dry
tart
and
acidic
finish
the
best
way
for
me
to
describe
it
is
like
cherry
pie
filling
cherry
pie
as
in
that
which
your
mother
would
make
not
hostess
wow
very
complex
and
if
nothing
else
divine
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
effervescent
at
first
when
chilled
then
somewhat
syrupy
when
it
reaches
room
temperature
moderate
in
alcohol
somewhat
sweet
somewhat
tart
but
overly
satisfying
this
belgianstyle
ale
drinks
incredibly
well
would
pair
incredibly
with
the
aforementioned
cherry
pie
as
an
appropriate
dessert
brew
better
yet
enjoy
it
by
itself
an
awesome
creation
from
new
glarus
a
huge
bigdog
thank
you
to
fellow
ba
xlperro
for
being
extremely
kind
enough
to
share
it
with
me
it
was
very
much
appreciated
proved
to
be
an
excellent
start
to
the
days
beer
activities
reddish
purple
brown
and
cloudy
with
a
pinkish
cotton
candy
head
resembles
many
mass
market
fruit
lambics
good
cherry
aroma
not
at
all
artificial
but
with
an
accurate
sense
of
sweetness
and
sourness
that
you
taste
in
real
fruit
some
yeasty
bready
notes
as
well
flavor
is
very
well
constructed
macerated
cherry
with
skin
in
a
very
natural
tart
state
an
accompanying
bit
of
wheaty
grain
makes
for
a
nice
velvety
mouthfeel
and
well
matched
sense
of
astringent
drying
for
the
finish
much
better
than
over
mass
market
sweetened
lambics
and
american
fruit
wheats
an
overalll
winner
still
a
little
too
sweet
i
am
still
hoping
against
all
odds
that
new
glarus
one
day
sells
on
the
other
side
of
the
wisconsin
border
overall
i
find
belgian
red
more
of
a
special
occasion
dessert
beer
than
anything
else
for
me
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
i
normally
like
if
i
could
change
anything
it
would
be
to
make
it
a
bit
tarter
and
a
wee
bit
maltier
573
great
fine
carbonation
scrubs
sourness
away
at
the
end
of
the
incredibly
long
finish
a
lick
of
the
lips
results
in
waves
of
sour
cherry
echoing
across
the
palate
a
tremendous
beer
a
well
crafted
brew
to
be
sure
but
one
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
all
too
often
i
will
keep
the
other
bottles
i
have
for
special
occasions
though
since
they
are
no
longer
available
outside
of
wisconsin
origianlly
sampled
7
october
2002
this
baby
has
a
beautifully
complex
nose
of
cherries
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
chocked
full
of
cherries
it
has
a
very
nice
red
color
this
beer
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
w
its
cherry
sourness
a
very
nice
example
of
a
sour
ale
yep
liked
it
extremely
fresh
soft
texture
with
a
wonderfully
lightly
tart
soft
natural
cherry
sourness
never
candyish
always
natural
except
the
aroma
kinda
smelled
like
lollypops
or
soemthing
mix
the
cherrys
in
with
some
light
oak
and
mayne
some
nuttyness
if
i
had
one
complaint
it
would
be
that
its
not
assertive
enough
more
sour
more
stink
but
hey
the
balance
couldnt
really
be
any
better
right
thanks
feloniousmonk
for
this
truly
classic
beer
reddish
brown
color
hazy
small
to
no
head
aroma
is
cherry
and
malt
wow
and
i
do
mean
wow
i
had
this
beer
several
years
ago
and
while
i
had
no
notes
on
it
it
tastes
exactly
the
way
i
remembered
it
medium
bodied
intense
cherry
flavor
sweet
sour
and
tart
there
is
some
malt
sweetness
as
well
as
hop
spiciness
as
well
complex
and
intense
flavors
extremely
smooth
not
very
beer
like
closest
style
might
be
a
lambic
but
who
cares
it
tastes
amazing
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
clean
and
sweet
world
class
beer
i
love
this
beer
first
you
have
to
consider
the
elegant
packaging
the
green
750ml
bottle
the
red
wax
even
the
label
is
classy
then
you
pour
aroma
is
a
blast
of
fresh
pie
cherries
and
the
color
a
hazy
beautiful
dark
pinkred
complete
with
a
light
pink
head
which
fades
quickly
taste
is
a
refreshing
sweettart
complex
sour
acetic
cherry
flavor
not
for
amateurs
my
friend
and
girlfriend
didnt
really
care
for
it
and
they
gave
me
theirs
she
said
the
tartness
and
carbonation
reminded
her
of
the
inside
of
zots
candy
more
for
me
just
one
drop
of
this
beer
is
loaded
with
flavors
medium
body
with
a
medium
brisk
carbonation
accentuating
the
tartness
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
at
the
gabf
from
tiny
flower
on
a
tree
to
a
ripe
red
fruit
for
use
in
this
wonderful
brew
the

has
not
been
featured
quite
like
this
before
the

poured
into
a
rounded
glass
its
the
color
of
ripe
cherry
red
with
a
very
pink
and
creamy
thick
head
the
aroma
is
bursting
with
ripe
whole
fresh
cherrys
pits
and
all
nothing
artificial
about
it
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
sweet
and
tart
whole
fresh
cherry
flavor
with
a
toasted
oak
finish
it
is
medium
body
holds
a
very
rich
but
refreshing
drink
the
carbonation
is
mellow
not
bubbly
allowing
the
complex
cherry
flavor
to
stand
tall
it
could
have
hit
a
5
in
taste
with
a
little
more
malt
in
the
backround
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
good
stuff
this
isnt
what
you
may
have
had
in
other
fruit
beers
pours
a
deep
reddish

has
a

you
can
tell
its
going
to
be
tart
right
away
fruity
citric
acid
makes
you
pucker
up
but
in
a
good
way
tastes
more
like
a
fruit
juice
than
a
beer
desert
drink
rather
than
an
everyday
beverage
was
really
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
one
after
trying
the
belgian
red
and
was
not
nearly
as
satisfied
with
it
very
sweet
rasberry
flavor
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
as
well
as
the
cherry
did
in
the
belgian
red
was
hoping
for
some
tartness
that
wasnt
there
just
fruity
sweetness
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
overall
some
argue
that
this
brew
is
not
supposed
to
be
sour
which
it
def
is
not
sour
what
so
ever
but
the
they
call
it
a
framboise
lambic
and
traditionally
the
style
is
a
little
funky
or
sour
this
was
only
fruit
syrup
tasting
so
incredibly
sweet
o
extremely
refreshing
and
drinkable
fwiw
it
would
be
helpful
for
beer
drinkers
to
log
flaws
that
would
help
establish
patterns
among
producersdistribution
chains
this
has
an
enormous
raspberry
nose
after
the
pour
i
can
smell
raspberries
with
the
glass
sitting
on
the
table
a
couple
of
feet
away
it
pours
a
raspberry
red
with
a
quickly
dissipating
pink
tinted
white
cap
the
palate
is
all
raspberries
with
the
light
malt
way
in
the
background
starting
with
a
light
sweetness
and
the
finishing
lemony
tart
the
texture
is
very
foamy
its
highly
carbonated
but
it
is
not
harsh
it
is
just
on
the
edge
of
bartles
and
james
territory
but
it
manages
to
step
back
from
the
precipice
of
falling
into
raspberry
soda
territory
way
to
sweet
like
drinking
the
syrup
for
a
snow
cone
i
have
no
idea
how
this
is
so
highly
rated
deserves
it
rating
outstanding
but
of
a
particular
niche
doesnt
really
register
as
beer
at
all
drinks
more
like
a
cider
or
even
just
fruit
juice
the
alcohols
so
low
its
practically
invisible
perfect
fare
for
a
picnic
or
a
kids
birthday
party
if
in
the
mood
its
heaven
but
you
gotta
be
in
the
mood
tastes
like
real
fresh
raspberries
not
raspberry
candy
like
rubaeus
or
rasberry
cough
syrup
like
raspberry
eisbock
once
i
got
past
the
fact
that
it
tastes
nothing
like
beer
it
was
very
enjoyable
very
sweet
but
with
enough
sour
to
balance
if
someone
told
me
it
was
raspberry
soda
id
have
believed
them
extremely
carbonated
overly
fruity
and
lower
than
desired
alcohol
content
overall
this
was
underwhelming
similar
to
strawberry
rhubarb
i
just
dont
get
the
hype
around
this
beer
overly
sweet
not
much
tart
and
very
syrupy
not
my
style
of
beer
just
feel
like
sugar
overtook
any
other
flavor
overallthis
lacks
any
of
the
beer
characteristics
of
their
apple
ale
this
is
more
like
a
soda
or
a
raspberry
wine
i
am
not
likely
to
purchase
this
again
as
it
does
not
remind
me
of
an
ale
whatsoever
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
has
delicious
raspberry
flavor
o
im
almost
sorry
i
gave
myself
time
to
appraise
this
thing
once
you
taste
it
its
a
slippery
slope
to
chugging
it
its
not
a
thinking
beer
but
in
its
simplicity
there
is
greatness
pours
a
deep
deep
ruby
red
with
a
pink
laced
healthy
head
the
moment
you
open
this
bottle
the
raspberry
scent
wafts
across
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
nose
here
somehow
the
tartness
does
not
overpower
the
sweetness
here
or
vice
versa
i
get
no
sour
feel
here
this
is
a
pure
dessert
beer
somehow
the
mouthfeel
and
lasting
taste
here
give
the
sense
that
you
have
been
drinking
a
squeezedpressed
bagful
of
freshly
picked
raspberries
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
the
raspberry
flavor
is
fantastic
id
love
to
try
a
few
of
their
sours
while
this
beer
leans
toward
the
sweet
side
theres
plenty
of
acidity
from
the
berries
to
provide
a
mouth
puckering
pop
pours
with
a
creamy
khaki
colored
head
that
produces
lots
of
wispy
lace
plenty
of
raspberry
aroma
with
a
bit
of
grain
in
the
background
tart
to
start
leading
to
a
sweet
but
not
cloying
middle
and
finish
big
raspberry
flavor
predominates
clean
fruit
finish
with
no
bitterness
medium
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
best
of
the
ng
fruits
i
have
had
so
far
trying
peach
soon
raspberries
galore
in
this
beer
smells
of
the
delectable
berry
with
a
touch
of
toast
in
the
background
from
the
malt
tastes
like
raspberry
cobbler
with
an
initial
rush
of
berry
sweetness
thats
quickly
overcome
by
slight
sour
puckering
and
just
when
you
think
the
beer
is
becoming
too
sweet
the
malt
hop
make
their
grand
beer
saving
entrance
and
balances
everything
out
finishes
slick
and
wet
leaving
my
palate
craving
for
the
next
sip
outstanding
from
the
masters
of
fruit
beers
overall
this
is
a
magnificent
beer
i
would
buy
it
regularly
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
to
me
this
tasted
much
more
like
a
cocktail
then
a
beer
all
i
really
got
in
the
taste
was
an
overly
sweet
taste
that
to
me
was
more
reminiscent
of
a
raspberry
syrup
then
fresh
raspberries
i
got
no
tartness
or
malt
balance
whatsoever
pours
a
dark
red
not
really
tart
sweet
with
great
raspberry
flavor
overall
a
damn
fruity
beer
but
a
damn
good
one
poured
a
rich
reddish
brown
color
with
a
short
tannishpink
head
the
nose
and
taste
of
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
mouthwatering
there
is
some
toasted
malt
and
bread
in
there
but
the
raspberries
are
truly
the
star
and
dominate
all
aspects
of
the
brew
there
is
a
hint
of
acid
and
some
mild
hop
spiciness
to
counterbalance
some
of
the
sweetness
the
fruit
is
the
true
star
and
this
beer
is
just
dripping
overripe
luscious
raspberries
total
4250
magnificent
an
outstanding
achievement
here
its
barely
beer
but
it
tastes
so
good
that
i
dont
care
ugh
been
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
and
im
pretty
sure
i
got
a
dud
when
poured
into
the
glass
it
has
a
very
nice
looking
head
that
was
very
thick
then
after
inspecting
the
beer
i
didnt
notice
a
jewel
like
sparkle
and
my
nose
detected
a
very
acidulous
smell
the
brew
poured
very
brown
and
muted
looking
in
color
after
the
first
sip
it
was
obvious
that
the
beer
was
off
lots
of
vinegar
and
a
very
acidic
burn
down
the
throat
barely
any
berries
to
speak
of
and
just
a
huge
disappointment
id
love
to
try
it
again
but
not
for
20
00
after
reading
all
of
the
reviews
i
was
expecting
amazingness
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
was
so
incredibly
sweet
and
not
in
a
good
way
it
burned
the
back
of
my
throat
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
either
this
was
as
sweet
as
sunny
delight
and
i
cant
stand
sunny
delight
o
usually
buy
as
many
as
i
can
when
the
opportunity
presents
itself
also
new
glarus
may
be
the
best
run
businessbrewery
on
their
scale
even
though
they
are
in
the
land
of
packer
nation
everything
from
their
outside
area
copper
kettles
sanitation
a
place
for
other
breweries
to
learn
from
for
sure
overall
i
am
blow
away
by
this
brew
ive
traveled
with
it
for
about
a
month
and
there
is
no
telling
how
old
it
is
but
it
taste
so
fresh
and
bright
the
framboise
body
alone
would
be
a
world
class
beer
but
the
fresh
berry
notes
push
it
to
legendary
bright
fresh
delicate
and
artfully
brewed
i
would
feel
bad
drinking
this
every
night
because
its
so
good
it
demands
to
be
consumed
after
a
world
class
meal
or
something
of
that
caliber
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
is
well
worth
the
pain
of
getting
it
trust
me
i
had
some
pains
getting
it
get
your
hands
on
this
beer
stored
colder
than
my
beer
fridge
and
poured
into
champagne
flutes
effervescent
with
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
great
lacing
and
slight
head
retention
clear
but
dark
red
not
that
it
needs
mentioning
but
fruity
aromas
and
sweet
light
crisp
taste
with
a
tart
finish
an
easy
drinker
and
pairs
perfectly
with
brunch
will
definitely
revisit
this
classic
poured
into
a
wine
glass
a
healthy
head
develops
atop
a
rose
colored
brew
scent
of
berries
is
pleasant
not
overpowering
tastes
to
me
exactly
like
whole
wheat
toast
with
butter
and
raspberry
jam
not
the
tart
i
was
expecting
but
i
cant
say
i
was
disappointed
by
that
medium
bodied
and
smooth
i
could
drink
this
all
night
lovely
rubypurple
color
the
nose
is
red
fruit
and
sugar
starts
off
a
bit
tart
like
an
underripe
raspberry
and
then
rounds
out
to
a
sticky
heavy
raspberry
sweetness
light
enough
to
drink
all
night
long
this
is
probably
my
favorite
from
new
glarus
to
date
perfect
summer
drinking
o
one
of
the
most
exceptional
fruit
beers
from
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
fruit
beer
brewers
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
is
dessert
in
a
glass
pure
raspberry
pleasure
starting
sweet
and
finishing
dry
and
tart
there
is
absolutely
nothing
else
like
it
o
new
glarus
knows
how
to
brew
fruit
beers
period
this
is
an
easy
drinking
low
alcohol
beer
that
is
perfect
to
have
after
a
meal
to
share
with
friends

down

14
inch
head
of
an

color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
strong
and
fresh
raspberries
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
fruit
vegetable
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
slight
tartness
and
slight
dryness
tastes
of
fresh
raspberries
hint
of
hops
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
the
aroma
and
body
of
the
raspberries
is
amazing
the
freshness
is
akin
the
samuel
smiths
raspberry
but
the
blend
is
even
better
it
tastes
of
more
than
pure
raspberry
juice
tart
slightly
hoppy
and
irresistible
enjoyed
the
beer
poured
very
well
chilled
from
a
750ml
into
a
large
goblet
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
nice
fruit
aroma
with
minimal
head
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
fairly
slightly
sour
tart
and
sweetness
from
the
raspberry
definitely
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
day
cheers
o
not
bad
but
the
feel
really
left
me
wanting
more
maybe
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
quality
raspberry
character
but
some
odd
aspects
along
the
way
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
ways
share
the
bottle
with
friends
over
desert
overall
b
o
an
exceptional
fruit
beer
best
fruit
beer
ever
insane
raspberries
and
more
raspberries
too
sweet
to
sip
more
than
one
but
soo
good
and
only
4
like
choklat
but
for
raspberries
this
is
simply
an
incredible
fruit
beer
i
kept
getting
so
much
more
than
fruit
on
my
palate
and
really
found
myself
enjoying
it
more
and
more
as
it
warmed
o
the
hops
and
malt
work
beautifully
in
the
background
to
help
create
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
due
to
the
balance
its
a
real
treat
i
really
wished
that
they
would
include
a
bottled
on
date
on
the
750ml
bottles
not
your
typical
beer
its
really
all
about
the
fruit
raspberries
are
my
favorite
fruit
so
this
was
awesome
overall
just
awesome
overall
a
wonderfully
refreshing
beer
i
just
tried
my
first
new
glarus
beer
this
week
and
i
already
cant
get
enough
this
one
is
easily
the
best
purely
fruity
beer
i
have
had
although
i
dont
think
its
perfect
there
isnt
much
to
change
to
get
it
there
it
poured
a
ruddy
reddishamber
with
great
foam
the
aroma
just
pops
with
a
fresh
berry
punch
its
the
same
on
the
palate
tart
and
crisp
and
wildly
vibrant
pucker
up
and
enjoy
it
a
real
treat
for
this
reviewer
this
beer
is
delicious
the
fruit
is
impeccable
it
was
very
refreshing
as
well
my
only
criticism
is
its
overly
sweet
after
a
few
sips
if
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
alcohol
i
feel
it
would
be
more
balanced
i
enjoyed
it
a
bit
better
after
mixing
in
a
bit
of
a
different
ale
to
cut
down
the
sweetness
overall
another
really
good
beer
from
new
glarus
as
with
most
of
their
fruit
beers
this
one
is
pretty
straight
forward
its
not
what
i
would
call
complex
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
what
it
is
is
a
really
tasty
fruit
beer
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
such
a
great
quality
beer
everyone
should
try
this
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
is
wonderful
it
is
always
consistent
lovely
color
aroma
and
taste
when
we
go
to
the
gabf
it
is
the
first
line
we
get
in
we
get
our
sample
and
go
right
back
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
get
another
overall
a
must
try
beer
o
is
new
glarus
my
favorite
brewery
they
might
be
they
knock
everything
out
of
the
park
and
this
is
no
exception
new
glarus
nailed
it
with
the
raspberries
the
beer
was
one
dimensional
but
its
an
extremely
well
made
and
delicious
one
dimensional
beer
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
the
raspberries
better
stay
clear
of
this
beer
if
you
like
well
made
lightly
tart
fruit
beers
you
better
make
a
run
for
the
wisconsin
border
and
pick
yourself
up
a
bottle
this
beer
kind
of
makes
me
wish
that
i
lived
in
wisconsin
big
thanks
to
mnbuffalo
for
hooking
me
up
overall
remarkable
overall
this
is
a
well
executed
fruit
beer
but
i
prefer
ngs
strawberry
rhubarb
to
this
as
the
raspberry
tart
doesnt
go
down
as
easy
im
gonna
keep
this
one
short
and
sweet
if
you
liked
serendipity
or
strawberry
rhubarb
youll
love
this
as
the
name
describes
this
is
a
very
raspberry
taste
with
lots
of
sweetness
and
a
deliciously
tart
finish
has
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
an
effervescent
feel
just
awesome
wow
what
separates
this
from
the
average
lindemans
offering
the
use
of
real
fruit
it
barely
tastes
candied
like
the
former
and
it
is
simply
true
joy
in
terms
of
maintaining
a
refreshing
and
flavorful
atmosphere
id
like
a
case
of
this
please
if
anyone
is
going
to
make
nonfunky
nonsoured
fruit
beers
the
right
way
it
will
always
be
new
glarus
this
is
a
prime
example
of
what
they
do
best
overall
this
smells
good
tastes
way
better
and
is
just
this
is
a
beer
i
want
around
to
be
drinking
in
the
summer
all
the
time
such
an
amazing
fruit
beer
i
could
elaborate
for
much
longer
but
i
wont
instead
ill
just
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
had
this
beer
is
outstanding
if
not
beyond
outstanding
try
this
when
you
have
the
chance
an
incredible
dessert
brew
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
full
of
raspberry
but
has
perfect
balance
very
tasty
and
highly
recommended
such
an
amazing
beer
completely
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
overall
we
immediately
paired
this
up
with
some
dark
chocolate
this
is
the
way
to
go
this
is
how
a
framboise
is
done
this
beer
is
fruity
rasberry
apple
lemonish
pear
tastes
come
off
this
beer
very
juicy
no
funk
or
tartness
compared
to
a
lambic
framboise
or
a
wild
very
tame
but
very
drinkable
great
flavorful
juices
its
like
something
god
would
drink
if
he
was
a
human
being
and
needed
refreshments
natures
harvest
hazy
dark
red
burgundy
with
a
small

aroma
is

fruit
raspberry
and
some
sealike
flavor
is
deep
sour
raspberry
very
intense
with
some
lemony
notes
and
a
fruity
acid
aftertaste
very
nice
medium
palate
start
filling
but
ends
dry
complex
refreshing
and
very
drinkable

very

super

not

a
great
fruit

a
very
tasty
beer
very
well
produced
it
is
very
natural
i
dont
get
the
typical
adjunctartificial
taste
like
some
other
fruit
based
beers
hats
off
to
new
glarus
overall
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
drink
enjoyed
it
out
on
my
patio
on
a
nice
sunny
fall
day
this
is
a
nice
treat
to
pick
up
once
a
year
or
so
when
im
up
in
wisconsin
thanks
atoneworks
for
this
amazing
beer
pours
a
hazy
ruby
color
with
a
large
head
that
dissipated
fast
but
did
leave
a
solid
finger
of
thick
foam
atop
the
beer
no
lacing
the
nose
can
be
described
in
one
word
raspberries
the
taste
isnt
very
far
removed
from
the
nose
raspberries
sweet
at
first
and
finishing
tart
almost
sour
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
balanced
this
beer
is
neither
cloying
sweet
nor
mouth
puckering
sour
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
outstanding
job
new
glarus
overall
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
just
right
if
i
traded
this
serendipity
and
wisconsin
belgian
red
would
be
on
my
permanent
iso
list
i
could
drink
this
every
day
this
really
is
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
the
essence
of
raspberry
is
totally
encapsulated
in
this
beer
edit
tried
this
one
again
super
pleasant
beer
that
tastes
great
and
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
i
would
increase
the
appearance
taste
and
overall
by
25
5
points
each
i
would
give
it
a
3
9
rating
today
omaybe
because
i
like
strawberries
and
cherries
better
than
raspberries
this
ranked
lowest
out
of
some
ng
fruit
beers
but
still
a
wonderful
beer
lets
face
it
this
is
about
as
good
of
a
fruit
beer
as
you
can
get
with
only
the
current
defunct
belgian
red
to
rival
it
this
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
color
with
a
fizzy
light
pink
head
the
aroma
erupts
with
the
scent
of
sweet
raspberries
the
taste
is
amazing
with
sweet
delicious
raspberries
only
downside
is
that
you
really
do
need
a
drinking
buddy
otherwise
1
bottle
is
way
too
much
sweetness
for
1
person
alone
reviewed

since
the
wife
likes
frambois
and
many
other
fruit
beers
i
have
gone
out
of
my
way
to
try
to
find
beer
she
can
appreciate
as
much
as
i
do
so
we
took
a
trip
up
to
wi
to
pick
up
some
ng
stuff
for
both
of
us
well
worth
the
quick
trip
from
chicago
lived
up
to
the
hype
raspberries
and
a
light
touch
of
oak
some
things
are
more
complicated
than
they
need
to
be
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
isnt
one
of
these
things
this
brew
is
bursting
with
fresh
berry
flavors
with
a
dry
tannin
kick
that
both
the
berries
and
the
oak
help
contribute
to
its
sweet
at
first
but
nicely
tart
at
the
end
o
my
personal
favorite
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
and
theyve
got
quite
a
few
top
notch
options
so
thats
saying
something
such
a
great
summertime
beer
extremely
well
made
i
wish
we
got
this
stuff
in
cali
overall
really
interesting
really
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
while
i
cant
say
im
a
fruit
beer
expert
this
was
really
excellently
put
together
and
at
no
point
seemed
sickeningly
sweet
which
was
my
worry
before
trying
it
o
not
your
run
of
the
mill
fruit
beer
this
ale
is
unique
expresive
and
would
be
a
damn
fine
pairing
partner
definitely
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
i
dont
think
i
liked
this
as
much
as
new
glaruss
apple
ale
or
serendipity
but
it
was
still
damn
good
i
prefer
this
one
to
founders
rübæus
just
by
a
little
bit
its
a
touch
more
succulent
juicy
and
fresh

this

the

and
its
not

another

is
that
its

by

probably
serve
some
of
this
at

to

saying
that
i
cant
imagine
a
fruit
beer
smelling
better
than
this
every
time
that
i
put
my
nose
in
the

but
awfully
syrupy
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
amazing
smell
not
only
raspberries
but
not
green
the
fruitiness
is
not
really
the
least
bit
artificial
and
theres
also
a
nice
powdery
pilsener
malt
presence
at
maybe

for
a

up
here
this
is
one
of
the
best
drinks
i
have
ever
had
but
drinkability
is
limited
to
being
full
and
leaves
a
thick
coating
in
my
mouth
after
each
sip
very
refreshing
the
rasberry
character
really
stands
right
out
for
all
the
sweetness
up
front
it
finishes
quite
dry
and

such

poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
wax
seal
and
story
about
the
beer
on
the
label
no
dating
info
the
color
was
a
dark
ruby
red
it
had
almost
no
head
and
that
was
gone
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
obviously
heavy
on
raspberries
but
you
could
also
smell
the
oak
from
the
barrels
also
had
a
bit
of
a
wine
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
really
good
and
not
too
raspberry
as
i
feared
it
might
i
like
raspberries
but
find
that
too
much
is
not
a
good
thing
the
only
downside
to
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
that
it
was
so
tart
that
each
drink
made
me
pucker
up
a
bit
not
enough
to
be
annoying
but
close
for
that
reason

really
hit

really
is

ya
all

will

and
sour
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
medium
level
of
carbonation
i
dont
think
they
could
have
nailed
it
any
better
for
the
style
i
poured
a
flute
for
the
wife
as
well
to
celebrate
the
night
it
was
wasted
on
her
as
she
just
couldnt
handle
the
taste
very
surprising
and
disapointing
as
one
glass
contains
enough
pleasure
and
torment
for
your
palate
during
the
course
of
an
evening
i
wish
that
this
were
more
accessible
to
me
but
why
bother
wasting
such
a
good
beer
on
a
girl
that
you
shouldnt
be
going
out
with
in
the
first
place
bigbelcheroct

followed
quickly
by
the
tart
and
sour
mouth
sensations
the
sourness
is
what
makes
this
beer
so
drinkable
and
gives
it
some
balance
without
the
tartness
this
beer
would
not
get
the
high
marks
it
receives
around
the
world
at
gabf
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
to
run
out
the
body
is
medium
light
with
the
fruit
providing
something
for
the
tongue
to
latch
on
to
the
co2
level
is
medium
high
perfect
for
the
style
the
finish
is
sour
and
not
overly
fruity
not
cloying
at
all
basically
and
im
just
overjoyed
so
far
and
then
worth
all

amazing

this

a

the

the

the

does

very
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
which
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
sour
apple
is
certainly
forward
sweet
but
not
overpowering
or
puckering
sweet
o
a
nice
take
on
an
apple
ale
very
easy
to
drink
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
too
acidic
or
sweet
that
you
can
only
have
one
would
have
no
problem
drinking
again
nice
straight
forward
apple
ale
not
too
sweet
not
as
complex
as
some
of
new
glarus
other
offerings
but
definitely
enjoyable
straight
up
apple
juice
with
malt
fair
with
rating
not
my
thing
apple
cider
assault
on
the
senses
wonderful
rendition
of
a
fruit
beer
best
cider
alternative
ive
had
overall
its
pretty
good
but
apple
just
isnt
an
interesting
enough
fruit
for
me
such
an
amazing
apple
flavor
it
is
not
artificial
at
all
nice
and
sweet
with
some
mild
tartness
new
glarus
can
do
no
wrong
with
fruit
beers
kinda
funky
like
sweet
apple
candy
just
too
sticky
sweet
for
my
liking
instead
of
an
apple
ale
i
feel
like
this
taste
more
like
an
apple
cherry
raspberry
sour
really
good
delicious
this
is
how
i
always
wanted
hard
cider
to
taste
but
it
never
does
tastes
and
smells
like
actual
apples
and
is
not
too
sweet
love
this
beer
amazing
with
cinnamon
whiskey
as
a
sidekick
light
copper
color
strong
fresh
apple
smell
and
taste
would
not
describe
this
as
a
beer
but
rather
a
carbonated
apple
juice
very
refreshing
and
slightly
on
the
dry
side
which
is
nice
because
its
not
overly
sweet
like
apple
juice
or
cider
typically
is
perhaps
i
just
wasnt
in
the
mood
as
i
love
all
ng
fruit
beers
but
this
one
was
just
a
hopped
up
apple
juice
to
me
overall
this
is
a
sweet
and
appley
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
but
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
to
just
quaff
all
day
overall
another
excellent
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
so
much
clean
crisp
fruit
character
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
12

purchased

unknown

date
poured
into
my
new
glarus
flutestyle
glass
drank
over
30
minutes
great
dessert
beer
really
joyed
this
after
a
nice
rich
meal
dont
normally
love
beers
this
sweet
but
i
would
recommend
this
for
certain
situations
sourish
apple
juice
authentic
swear
i
can
taste
the
peel
shavings
flavor
leaves
a
sour
creamy
feel
this
one
left
me
a
lot
on
the
fence
and
a
few
days
after
i
still
cant
quite
seem
to
make
up
my
mind
if
i
l
would
try
it
again
or
not
interesting
for
sure
o
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
a
beer
that
tastes
this
much
like
apple
juice
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
you
might
want
to
go
as
high
as
a
4
5
but
for
me
as
a
standalone
product
for
which
i
had
no
expectations
it
was
a
goodtasting
easydrinking
ale
that
went
real
easy
on
the
abv
but
not
necessarily
what
im
inclined
toward
in
an
ale
strong
apple
juice
better
than
any
cider
pours
light
copper
with
little
head
smells
like
apple
cider
very
fruity
aroma
interesting
flavor
lots
of
apple
flavor
very
tart
at
the
same
time
lots
of
malt
flavor
if
you
can
imagine
a
nice
amber
beer
with
tart
apples
blended
oddly
very
nice
because
it
sounds
horrible
but
is
actually
great
this
would
be
it
this
is
definitely
not
a
cider
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
want
something
different
a
beer
with
strong
cider
character
overall
so
there
is
excellent
apple
flavor
here
but
if
there
is
a
brown
ale
base
used
here
it
has
been
overcome
by
the
apples
if
you
like
apples
youre
going
to
love
this
as
the
apples
are
bold
and
natural
flavored
im
glad
to
have
tried
and
rated
this
but
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
brilliant
deep
copper
writer
a
lingering
frothy
cream
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
red
apple
flesh
and
green
apple
skin
slightly
floral
and
i
dont
know
if
its
just
suggestive
but
i
get
a
little
cinnamon
flavor
is
the
best
apple
product
ive
ever
had
im
not
a
huge
apple
fan
but
that
lingering
apple
flavor
is
balanced
nicely
between
sweet
red
and
a
sour
note
reminiscent
of
an
oud
bruin
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
complexity
wish
i
had
bought
more
2013
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
12
finger
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
tangy
apple
bite
comes
through
in
the
nose
maybe
a
little
caramel
in
there
too
it
smells
like
cider
in
a
way
that
no
other
ale
does
right
up
my
alley
taste
is
appley
and
tangy
upfront
the
sides
give
a
little
pucker
its
pretty
much
apple
until
the
finish
which
has
some
malty
wheat
flavor
after
the
apple
fades
5
mins
or
so
theres
a
vegetal
aftertaste
that
i
dont
recall
from
the
previous
bottling
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
which
tingles
the
tongue
and
the
throat
on
the
way
down
overall
its
wellmade
lots
of
apple
some
acidity
some
tanginess
it
isnt
very
complicated
but
its
very
very
enjoyable
it
tastes
a
bit
like
cider
but
it
isnt
so
i
give
it
extra
points
for
the
style
heres
hoping
this
special
edition
brew
continues
to
make
a
regular
appearance
o
very
similar
to
a
cider
maybe
a
bit
thicker
and
maltier
than
most
overall
good
but
not
ngs
best
overall
really
amazing
apple
flavor
i
just
dont
even
understand
how
they
translated
apples
into
beer
so
perfectly
a
very
delicious
and
refreshing
brew
that
stands
up
as
a
beer
instead
of
a
cider
not
amazing
but
raul
likes
it
yep
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
with
bubbly
tan
head
that
settles
pretty
quickly
into
a
medium
tan
collar
aroma
is
of
warm
apple
cider
brown
sugar
cinnamon
some
faint
clove
taste
is
wonderfully
the
same
apple
sweet
caramel
and
some
spice
fairly
carbonated
and
medium
body
another
amazing
beer
from
new
glarus
overall
ehhh
i
cant
say
i
am
disappointed
because
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
one
overall
it
just
tastes
like
cider
and
there
isnt
much
else
too
it
o
geat
representation
of
style
they
sure
know
how
to
make
fruit
beers
in
wisconsin
and
would
sure
like
to
get
more
for
those
warmer
days
ahead
next
time
i
will
have
to
try
this
ala
mode
o
tasty
and
refreshing
but
i
couldve
used
some
more
carbonation
o
impressive
beer
takes
the
apple
ale
game
to
another
level
flavors
are
reminiscent
of
the
best
apple
ciders
with
enhanced
body
and
malt
backbone
suggestions
of
caramel
malt
lends
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
but
this
beer
is
really
as
straightforward
as
the
name
well
done
o
as
a
fan
of
hard
cider
and
beer
i
really
like
ngs
apple
ale
its
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
i
should
have
bought
more
than
a
single
4pack
high
a
o
ill
admit
im
not
a
fan
of
hard
ciders
so
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
wowed
here
but
this
stuff
is
solid
new
glarus
just
cant
do
any
wrong
with
fruit
beer
o
its
like
apple
juice
as
a
beer
new
glarus
does
a
very
good
job
with
these
fruit
beers
quite
a
delicious
beer
much
more
substantial
and
full
then
a
hard
cider
malt
adds
a
warm
sweetness
and
bready
flavor
coupled
with
the
light
spice
notes
this
tastes
like
a
delicate
apple
tart
beer
is
light
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensit
resulting
in
a
lightly
foamy
15
and
otherwise
smooth
45
mouthfeel
thats
a
bit
watery
overall
closes
dry
with
substantial
sweetness
clinging
to
the
palate
overall
basically
apple
cider
that
happens
to
be
beer
solid
good
for
the
fruit
beer
style
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
secure
again
in
the
future
o
new
glarus
just
nails
fruit
beers
every
time
while
not
my
preferred
style
i
can
totally
respect
what
they
do
with
these
because
theyre
delicious
and
super
easy
to
drink
apple
ale
is
a
fun
sweet
and
refreshing
take
that
i
really
enjoy
well
done
another
outstanding
entry
in
new
glarus
thumbprint
series
this
is
the
third
one
ive
had
and
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
each
one
of
them
my
hats
off
to
this
amazing
little
brewery
thats
been
around
longer
than
many
people
realize
and
thanks
to
ri0
for
hooking
me
up
i
really
envy
our
wisconsin
bas
for
being
able
to
get
these
outstanding
beers
so
easily
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
apples
almost
to
the
point
where
it
is
hard
to
remember
you
are
drinking
a
beer
the
apple
flavor
was
very
smooth
though
and
it
was
enjoyable
to
drink
o
a
very
well
done
apple
ale
by
new
glarus
they
have
this
corner
of
the
market
nailed
down
golden
color
with
splotchy
lacing
and
little
to
no
head
the
nose
is
a
brown
sugar
and
of
course
sweet
apples
slightly
viscous
with
light
carbonation
and
a
lingering
finish
but
i
wish
the
finish
was
a
little
bit
longer
im
going
to
keep
the
other
three
that
i
havent
tried
them
when
the
weather
warms
up
i
will
certainly
look
for
more
in
the
future
overall
the
beginning
of
this
brew
is
so
wonderful
but
just
does
not
have
the
gusto
that
new
glarus
other
fruit
beers
have
more
of
a
gimmicky
feel
then
a
truly
great
fruit
beer
would
be
a
good
choice
for
a
cider
fan
honestly
this
couldnt
be
any
more
delicious
if
they
tried
its
adult
apple
juice
basically
its
better
than
any
cider
i
can
recall
having
overall
another
absolutely
amazing
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
apple
ale
is
another
good
beer
from
new
glarus
but
in
my
opinion
should
be
done
away
with
in
the
thumbprint
series
the
fruited
750s
are
much
more
enjoyable
and
the
limited
number
of
thumbprint
releases
would
be
better
served
leaving
this
out
of
the
yearly
lineup
overall
i
can
get
used
to
this
new
glarus
fruit
beer
thing
havent
been
let
down
yet
pours
an
ever
so
hazy
golden
amber
with
some
flimsy
white
edging
aroma
is
clearly
apples
a
nice
blend
of
tart
and
sweet
a
bit
of
wheat
and
spice
on
the
end
taste
is
similar
very
tasty
and
fresh
apple
juice
with
a
grainywheat
finish
and
a
lingering
sweetness
crazy
delicious
crisp
and
medium
bodied
o
very
much
like
dans
other
fruit
beers
sweet
and
clean
this
one
is
somewhat
ciderlike
but
with
palpable
notes
of
malted
wheat
another
win
for
new
glarus
and
its
no
surprise
its
yet
another
fruit
infused
beer
i
could
hoard
this
stuff
in
my
house
its
flavorful
and
simple
but
there
are
some
undeniable
complexities
that
come
straight
from
the
yeast
and
brewing
process
used
beers
already
taste
good
when
theres
actual
fresh
fruit
added
and
they
taste
even
better
when
theres
a
spicy
funky
yeast
to
back
it
up
wonderful
tasty
stuff
overall
o
dont
have
much
to
compare
this
one
to
but
its
spot
on
with
what
it
clams
to
be
lots
of
apples
crisp
and
juicy
a
apple
ale
i
really
enjoy
this
and
want
to
try
more
new
glarus
overall
awesome
apple
ale
better
then
any
apple
cider
i
have
had
the
ladies
and
guys
will
be
surprised
at
how
good
it
tastes
pours
a
light
apple
cider
hue
with
a
surprisingly
lasting
head
the
smell
is
all
apple
and
is
crisp
and
fresh
while
this
ale
has
a
fresh
apple
taste
it
is
well
balanced
with
some
tartness
there
is
a
lingering
beer
taste
underneath
the
heavy
apple
flavor
it
is
well
carbonated
as
expected
overall
this
is
a
great
apple
ale
fresh
sweet
but
balanced
but
without
letting
you
forget
that
you
are
drinking
a
beer
another
fine
brew
from
new
glarus
a
fun
drinking
beer
lots
of
sweetness
sour
apple
aroma
with
slight
sour
taste
more
sweet
tasting
to
me
little
to
no
hop
aroma
and
taste
slight
cloudness
in
glass
might
be
fun
to
mix
this
with
a
sour
lambic
to
see
what
you
got
over
a
refreshing
beer
that
i
would
try
again
this
is
pretty
unique
and
fun
to
try
its
not
entirely
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
see
this
being
a
popular
choice
for
many
people
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
broken
white
sheet
atop
smells
like
apples
and
maybe
a
bit
of
cherry
juice
as
well
flavor
is
sweet
apples
with
just
a
hint
of
tartness
on
em
some
caramelized
sugars
some
bits
of
grain
medium
on
thin
with
prickly
lowmod
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
i
like
this
beer
i
bet
its
cheaper
than
the
lindemans
also
i
wish
there
were
more
of
these
apple
ales
i
quite
like
them
when
done
well
apple
ale
they
werent
joking
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
didnt
have
a
variety
of
flavors
it
had
one
big
delicious
flavor
and
thats
it
extremely
drinkable
i
would
drink
another
bottle
big
thanks
to
fellow
ba
mnbuffalo
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beer
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
no
surprise
there
this
is
really
sweet
and
could
probably
benefit
from
some
tartness
regardless
the
amount
of
apple
flavor
here
is
amazing
i
hope
to
drink
this
again
repeatedly
perhaps
out
of
a
juice
box
o
not
something
id
drink
every
day
but
an
interesting
cider
ale
hybrid
its
like
apple
pie
in
a
glass
o
very
tasty
like
grown
up
apple
juice
it
certainly
echoes
hard
cider
to
a
degree
except
for
the
fact
that
the
apple
notes
here
taste
wholesome
and
fresh
as
opposed
to
chemically
induced
additionally
the
beer
doesnt
wander
off
into
a
syrupy
sweet
mess
booze
isnt
detectable
though
im
not
getting
a
lot
malt
or
hop
presence
either
pretty
impressive
and
tasty
effort
here
if
you
are
a
fruit
beer
fan
bottle
from
trade
pours
cloudy
orange
brown
smell
is
all
apple
cider
some
fermented
apples
and
more
apple
juice
prickly
carbonation
up
front
apple
flavors
and
something
else
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
light
caramel
comes
out
as
i
get
deeper
very
effervescent
dry
finish
keeps
it
from
being
a
very
sweet
cider
neat
beer
but
really
teetering
on
regular
old
cider
dont
get
much
malt
presence
here
however
i
am
not
complaining
as
this
is
quite
yummy
duplicating
the
flavor
of
a
cider
is
an
interesting
feat
but
it
is
not
what
i
am
really
looking
for
in
a
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
have
enjoyed
new
glarus
other
fruit
beers
more
oa
great
fruit
beer
great
blend
of
flavors
and
while
it
has
easy
drinkability
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
amazing
flavor
for
4
flavor
wise
it
tastes
more
like
10
fantastic
fruit
beer
done
right
sweet
without
being
too
sweet
one
of
the
hardest
things
to
accomplish
i
didnt
want
this
one
to
end
needless
to
say
ill
be
getting
my
hands
on
some
more
new
glarus
stuff
pronto
those
guys
know
what
theyre
doing
up
there
in
ol
wisconsin
othis
beer
is
delicious
and
i
would
love
to
have
more
at
my
disposal
thanks
again
for
the
experimentation
new
glarus
the
beer
poors
honey
gold
with
a
wispy
white
head
the
nose
is
diacetyl
buttery
apple
pie
candy
same
killer
fresh
baked
apple
pie
taste
with
a
tart
dry
finish
light
bodied
drinkable
tons
of
fresh
apple
tart
apple
finish
damn
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
exactly
as
describedexpected
its
apples
in
a
bottle
with
booze
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
and
lacking
that
tart
edge
i
like
with
other
new
glarus
fruit
offerings
solid
nonetheless
d
its
akin
to
braggot
substituting
cider
for
mead
and
im
not
sure
if
theres
a
name
for
this
style
the
freshness
of
the
fruit
and
perfect
balance
are
outstanding
i
do
wish
there
was
more
malt
character
o
overall
im
pretty
surprised
by
this
beer
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
but
new
glarus
definitely
delivered
again
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
12
ounces
of
this
beer
for
being
only
4
im
finding
it
pretty
sweet
and
rich
the
way
this
beer
blurs
the
lines
between
an
ale
and
cider
is
pretty
unreal
keep
doing
what
you
do
new
glarus
o
well
hell
its
hard
to
rank
beers
like
this
its
basically
pure
apple
with
some
caramel
and
some
wheat
its
simple
but
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
and
it
does
exactly
what
it
intends
to
do
much
like
new
glarus
other
fruit
beers
top
notch
for
the
style
imo
barring
their
redraspberry
ales
which
are
glorious
o
im
loving
this
beer
much
more
than
i
initially
thought
i
would
when
i
purchased
it
it
delivers
such
a
balanced
flavor
without
being
overkill
these
guys
definitely
know
what
they
are
doing
with
fruit
beer
o
this
is
definitely
the
closest
to
apple
juice
that
ive
experienced
in
a
beer
even
more
so
then
hard
apple
ciders
in
my
opinion
it
was
well
executed
very
good
for
an
apple
ale
and
probably
my
favorite
out
of
the
ng
fruit
ales
if
you
like
apple
juice
and
beer
im
sure
you
will
love
this
o
i
am
really
upset
i
didnt
buy
more
than
a
4
pack
of
this
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
find
again
next
time
i
am
in
wisconsin
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
in
warm
weather
very
refreshing
i
might
even
include
in
a
cider
tasting
to
do
some
side
by
sides
i
am
a
big
fan
of
cider
but
in
all
honesty
new
glarus
apple
ale
is
better
than
any
cider
ive
ever
had
like
i
said
that
malt
finish
replaces
the
lowpoint
of
cider
with
one
of
the
highpoints
of
bier
o
very
unique
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
just
guess
that
i
was
drinking
the
best
apple
cider
ive
ever
had
doesnt
taste
of
beer
or
alcohol
at
all
simply
lovely
overall
this
is
a
great
first
impression
of
new
glarus
i
have
their
other
fruit
beers
and
this
just
gets
me
excited
to
try
those
drinks
like
a
cider
yet
the
grain
at
the
end
proves
that
this
is
indeed
a
beer
excellent
unique
beer
from
what
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
big
thanks
goes
out
to
staywhatyouare2
for
sending
this
one
my
way
served
from
bottle
into
a
new
glarus
flute
also
from
staywhatyouare2
poured
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
green
apple
pastry
bread
sugar
and
apple
pie
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
pastry
green
apple
sugar
apple
pie
and
subtle
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
upon
first
investigation
of
this
one
i
was
knocked
back
by
the
aroma
of
apple
pie
i
couldnt
believe
what
i
was
smelling
this
beer
smelled
like
america
so
right
out
of
the
gate
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
the
flavor
even
carried
over
on
this
one
with
the
same
components
im
really
glad
this
was
the
case
because
usually
a
lot
is
lost
between
the
two
when
i
really
enjoy
the
aroma
really
well
done
on
this
one
new
glarus
o
this
was
pretty
good
and
definitely
interesting
that
said
my
expectations
for
this
was
that
it
would
be
an
apple
version
of
wbr
and
it
didnt
live
up
to
that
overall
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
straight
up
fruit
beers
ive
had
great
apple
flavor
effervescent
sparkling
apple
light
mulling
spices
and
sweetness
overall
quite
nice
i
could
drink
tons
of
these
very
nice
beverage
definitely
something
that
my
significant
other
enjoys
will
seek
out
more
next
autumn
new
glarus
if
you
read
this
please
make
a
bretted
version
of
this
i
feel
that
it
could
turn
out
incredible
pours
dark
brownblack
copper
hazy
no
foam
strong
apple
cider
smell
pronounced
taste
is
all
apple
some
cinnamon
notes
strong
apple
finishes
with
a
mild
malt
that
switches
back
to
beer
otherwise
its
very
cidery
smooth
and
light
good
if
you
want
a
well
made
hard
cider
knock
off
really
clever
hazy
orange
with
a
finger
or
two
of
white
head
retention
is
minimal
but
theres
some
lacing
nose
has
some
apple
flesh
and
some
mild
spicing
vaguely
resmebling
some
apple
pie
malt
is
semisweet
and
almost
resembles
a
cider
more
cooked
apples
and
spicing
that
further
resembles
apple
pie
sweet
malt
and
a
sortadry
finish
fairly
high
carbonation
that
i
wasnt
crazy
about
but
a
few
swirls
took
this
down
to
an
amazing
level
new
glarus
does
it
again
best
fruit
beers
around
overall
now
this
is
a
great
apple
ale
the
only
other
type
of
apple
ale
i
have
had
is
shipyard
applehead
and
this
new
glarus
kicks
it
out
of
the
ballpark
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
fruit
beer
new
glarus
hits
a
homerun
on
this
one
this
is
really
fantastic
imagine
this
your
wife
and
kids
are
making
christmas
cookies
and
drinking
hot
apple
cider
youre
looking
to
join
in
but
instead
want
something
with
a
little
kick
instead
and
you
wonder
to
yourself
what
should
i
go
buy
bam
new
glarus
apple
ale
thats
what
this
is
a
great
fallwinter
seasonal
pours
like
pressed
apple
cider
with
a
beautiful
sour
smell
i
mentioned
to
a
good
friend
that
this
makes
me
feel
like
a
cross
between
father
christmas
and
a
founding
father
as
i
imagine
this
style
was
big
in
the
mid
1700s
sour
apple
taste
thats
it
man
apple
no
malt
no
hops
just
apples
a
little
tingly
on
the
tongue
but
nothing
special
in
the
mouth
high
drinkability
due
to
low
abv
and
a
great
taste
i
should
save
a
couple
of
these
for
christmas
eve
but
they
wont
last
that
long
like
most
new
glarus
fruit
beers
this
isnt
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
its
a
welcome
and
delicious
surprise
my
biggest
problem
with
it
is
that
its
like
drinking
apple
juice
with
a
small
chaser
of
beer
i
wish
there
were
more
beer
in
it
im
conflicted
as
a
fruit
drink
its
freaking
delicious
as
a
beer
well
it
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
a
beer
tastes
very
much
like
it
smells
only
just
a
little
bit
gleefully
alcoholic
it
tastes
like
fizzy
apple
cider
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
booze
burn
near
the
back
and
then
the
aftertaste
is
a
chewy
yeast
thats
similar
to
the
one
they
use
in
their
fruit
beers
i
pick
up
no
nodes
of
brown
ale
but
i
absolutely
dont
need
to
because
this
gets
the
job
done
just
fine
overall
an
interesting
and
pretty
tasty
take
on
a
fruit
beer
its
like
fresh
apple
juice
but
has
just
enough
malt
presence
to
make
it
a
beer
o
this
was
a
great
representation
of
an
apple
cider
beer
i
love
that
it
had
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
was
full
of
fresh
apple
flavor
it
is
sweet
but
not
overbearing
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
on
the
fence
about
fruit
beer
o
sooo
fresh
and
inviting
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
o
i
love
this
beer
i
need
to
get
more
of
it
extremely
sessionable
and
something
i
could
drink
with
dinner
new
glarus
how
are
you
this
good
with
putting
fruit
in
beer
i
give
this
one
7
green
bananas
o
a
delicious
apple
fruit
beer
that
isnt
the
garbage
that
is
out
there
from
the
macros
get
some
o
a
great
beer
i
had
no
idea
what
id
think
of
it
but
holy
crap
i
need
to
get
more
o
im
glad
the
base
brown
ale
malts
still
have
some
say
in
the
taste
and
it
doesnt
come
off
as
a
cider
a
nicely
put
together
beer
with
the
main
focus
being
the
apples
definitely
a
nice
fall
treat
o
good
beer
even
though
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
applerelated
products
all
the
time
thanks
a
lot
too
treebs
for
giving
me
this
as
an
extra
cheers
o
there
are
many
ciders
that
lack
the
depth
and
intensity
of
apple
aroma
and
flavor
as
found
in
this
beer
the
age
may
have
slight
softened
the
beer
but
it
still
an
outstanding
ale
pours
a
clear
ambergold
with
a
slight
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
and
a
small
island
of
haze
absolutely
lovely
apple
aromas
emanate
from
the
glass
not
quite
real
but
not
quite
fake
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
apple
schnapps
by
dad
drinks
taste
is
obviously
appleforward
but
a
much
more
identifiable
red
apple
flavor
as
opposed
to
the
generic
apple
aromas
theres
a
touch
of
light
grain
some
honey
and
an
almost
cinnamonlike
quality
in
here
too
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spritzy
with
a
fairly
thin
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
an
entirely
enjoyable
brew
that
100
lives
up
to
my
expectation
i
feel
that
a
sixpack
of
this
would
disappear
quite
fast
cheers
to
the
cpj
for
sending
it
my
way
o
overall
this
was
a
delicious
beer
love
the
sour
applegreen
applecandied
apple
flavours
and
aromas
going
on
o
sweet
candy
apple
wierd
but
good
definitely
worth
a
try
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
sweet
apple
flavor
cost
2
99
for
a
12
oz
bottle
or
10
99
for
a
four
pack
pours
a
clear
light
amber
golden
color
well
carbonated
with
a
wispy
white
head
nose
is
heavy
on
green
apple
slightly
tart
bready
mild
honey
and
leafy
earth
flavor
is
surprisingly
well
balanced
between
a
golden
ale
bready
malt
and
dough
with
a
slightly
less
artificial
than
jolly
rancher
green
apple
sweettart
flavor
medium
full
body
strong
carbonation
and
a
sticky
doughy
finish
wasnt
pleasantly
surprised
to
enjoy
the
entire
bottle
alone
despite
some
initial
hesitation
that
this
would
turn
too
cloying
pours
a
clear
golden
color
almost
pilsner
or
bmc
like
medium
white
head
scent
is
wow
a
fresh
orchard
of
red
apples
red
and
fuji
apple
aromas
not
the
typical
green
apple
aroma
i
get
from
most
belgian
beers
very
unique
hints
of
cinnamon
this
smells
better
than
any
apple
cider
or
sparkling
cider
i
have
ever
had
and
the
fact
that
its
a
beer
absolutely
blows
my
mind
taste
is
initially
sweet
red
apple
which
somehow
changes
to
a
very
mildly
tart
green
apple
i
know
i
read
reviews
of
this
beer
tasting
like
a
green
jolly
rancher
and
they
are
absolutely
right
that
is
my
favorite
jolly
rancher
and
now
its
in
beer
form
this
is
weird
because
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
on
the
regular
but
for
the
style
being
a
fruit
beer
this
is
the
best
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
sparkling
ciderlike
drinkability
is
extremely
high
overall
this
beer
is
tasty
i
dont
care
who
you
are
if
you
are
a
fan
of
apples
you
will
love
this
beer
the
freshapple
flavor
is
like
nothing
i
have
ever
experienced
other
than
freshsqueezed
apple
juice
of
course
this
beer
blew
me
away
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
traditional
apple
cider
would
instead
this
is
literally
an
apple
alebeer
there
are
so
many
wonderful
apple
qualities
and
flavors
here
to
keep
me
coming
back
again
and
again
id
love
to
drink
this
yearround
the
reveal
new
glarus
apple
ale
well
this
is
a
great
beer
to
send
in
this
bif
if
only
because
it
is
so
polar
in
all
accounts
reading
the
label
it
says
they
used
green
apple
juice
im
wondering
if
it
was
concentrate
overall
impression
quite
interesting
caught
too
much
artificial
flavors
in
the
mouthfeel
though
will
still
be
giving
this
one
an
above
average
rating
not
sure
ive
had
an
apple
ale
like
this
ever
before
i
recommend
picking
this
one
up
along
with
the
others
from
new
glarus
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinker
warm
or
cold
weather
one
can
consume
a
lot
of
this
complex
fruit
beer
i
only
wish
this
were
a
regular
beer
by
new
glarus
poured
a
light
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
little
bit
of
a
foam
around
the
brim
as
soon
as
the
bottlecap
pried
open
my
face
was
hit
by
a
curtain
of
apples
ive
had
plenty
of
cider
in
my
days
and
i
have
to
say
the
only
one
that
ever
tasted
like
real
apples
was
harpoons
but
this
is
just
out
of
this
world
you
can
tell
they
used
a
few
different
kinds
of
apples
for
sure
the
taste
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
which
is
great
i
think
maybe
they
use
their
base
recipe
for
spotted
cow
on
this
one
same
mouthfeel
with
the
fizziness
and
crisp
this
is
a
great
experiment
by
them
and
i
am
glad
i
have
3
more
to
save
for
the
summer
months
o
if
you
dont
like
apples
then
it
should
be
obvious
this
is
not
the
ale
for
you
if
you
do
like
apples
then
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
immensely
new
glarus
knows
how
to
make
a
good
fruit
beer
and
this
offering
does
not
disappoint
o
ng
does
fruit
beers
better
than
most
others
this
is
a
great
anytime
beer
but
1
per
sitting
is
good
enough
because
of
the
sweet
apple
nature
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
another
good
fruit
beer
from
ng
ive
yet
to
have
a
bad
one
from
them
this
was
exactly
what
i
was
expectinghoping
for
as
it
tastes
a
lot
like
hard
ciderapple
juice
while
i
enjoyed
the
ng
cranbic
more
if
i
could
buy
any
of
these
fruit
beers
off
the
shelf
id
always
have
some
in
my
fridge
o
this
is
a
delicious
fruit
beer
clean
and
crisp
however
no
more
than
two
or
else
your
stomach
will
start
feeling
it
o
excellent
fruit
beer
i
would
not
expect
less
from
new
glarus
and
one
of
my
personal
favorites
of
the
style
it
never
lets
you
forget
youre
actually
drinking
a
beer
either
must
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
fruity
beer
or
apples
and
recommended
if
you
wanna
try
something
new
good
stuff
thanks
to
spdklz
for
this
great
extra
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
nothing
overly
complex
but
this
is
just
a
delicious
liquid
embodiment
of
tart
apples
starts
out
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
fairly
dry
so
that
its
not
cloying
light
to
medium
bodied
with
fairly
high
carbonation
quite
a
refreshing
brew
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
cheers
i
couldnt
see
knocking
back
an
entire
4
pack
to
myself
but
i
think
a
few
ounces
of
this
stuff
during
a
drinking
session
really
hits
the
spot
they
add
enough
other
stuff
to
it
to
make
it
right
up
the
alley
of
apple
pie
crust
cinnamon
orecommended
try
especially
when
it
first
comes
out
on
hotter
days
and
well
chilled
a
real
fun
beer
to
drink
o
a
pretty
good
apple
ale
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
bodied
and
clear
rusty
copper
in
color
with
a
very
light
and
quickly
dissipating
off
white
lacing
it
doesnt
look
like
much
the
aromas
are
of
slightly
buttery
spiced
caramel
apples
it
smells
great
like
roasted
apples
with
cinnamon
the
flavors
mimic
the
aromas
with
more
of
an
apple
juicecider
type
flavor
than
the
roasted
apples
it
has
nice
flavor
and
isnt
cloying
like
lindemans
pomme
the
closest
thing
i
could
relate
it
to
is
perhaps
leinenkugels
apple
spice
that
they
used
to
make
it
drinks
really
light
in
body
and
has
nice
flavor
at
four
percent
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
my
fiancé
would
love
this
well
apple
ale
looks
lousy
tastes
great
insert
your
own
misogynystic
joke
here
i
suppose
i
liked
this
slightly
better
than
raspberry
tart
even
but
like
rt
due
to
the
sugarsour
experience
i
couldnt
ever
throw
down
a
huge
amount
at
one
sitting
but
i
will
be
buying
it
a
really
nice
apple
beer
i
wish
it
was
just
a
touch
more
bitter
and
a
bit
less
sweet
but
id
only
be
nitpicking
i
love
this
stuff
my
hat
off
to
dan
as
usual
probably
the
only
exception
was
chocoabbey
man
what
was
that
about
o
not
anything
like
i
was
expecting
hard
to
classify
this
one
as
a
beer
more
of
a
hard
cider
i
would
say
nonetheless
i
will
see
if
i
can
get
it
again
drink
damn
this
was
tasty
between
all
their
fruit
beers
they
really
should
move
out
to
all
parts
of
the
country
they
are
killing
it
with
this
style
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
here
in
so
cal
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
othis
is
a
decent
beer
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
cider
or
even
a
cidral
mexican
cabornated
apple
soda
for
11
99
i
would
seek
another
beer
but
i
was
suckered
into
it
since
the
likelihood
of
finding
this
beer
in
illinois
is
rare
i
really
like
this
beer
i
have
never
tasted
a
beer
quite
like
this
before
as
mentioned
before
its
like
drinking
a
sparkling
wine
or
champaigne
i
also
like
that
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
with
my
wife
as
she
really
enjoys
it
as
well
new
glarus
apple
ale
is
hard
to
come
by
in
my
neighorhood
but
i
will
again
go
through
the
effort
to
find
it
again
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
an
excellent
fruit
beer
o
ng
is
the
king
of
fruit
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
would
love
a
case
of
this
to
pull
from
on
the
days
i
feel
like
a
break
from
big
boozy
stouts
and
barleywines
taste
is
pretty
sweet
it
has
a
lot
of
apple
flavor
obviously
beer
flavor
is
light
but
it
works
well
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
fruity
beer
and
lives
up
to
that
designation
overall
a
good
specialty
beer
with
some
interesting
flavor
and
is
different
do
strike
it
up
as
another
world
class
fruit
beer
from
dan
and
company
my
only
minor
complaint
is
the
head
retention
i
could
see
how
some
would
say
this
becomes
cloying
after
awhile
but
i
think
its
great
id
really
like
to
see
this
be
a
yearround
750ml
offering
from
new
glarus
right
along
side
its
cousins
brothers
o
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
cider
or
wine
cooler
or
better
yet
a
glass
of
apple
juice
too
sweet
and
has
no
taste
or
anything
that
i
enjoy
from
beer
i
do
however
understand
how
some
people
enjoy
this
beer
verdict
this
blows
ciders
away
massive
apple
flavors
but
nice
touches
with
the
biscuit
and
spicing
that
is
so
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
flavorful
such
a
great
take
on
beer
dan
proves
once
again
that
he
is
the
unabridged
king
of
fruit
beers
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
living
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
an
envy
of
anyone
living
out
of
state
o
this
is
a
sweet
beer
i
could
drink
over
and
over
again
its
a
very
attractive
beer
with
lots
of
apple
flavor
and
smell
and
highly
drinkable
with
a
small
abv
delicious
since
i
like
apple
candy
i
like
the
beer
as
a
homebrewer
and
cider
maker
i
realize
how
difficult
it
can
be
to
make
fruits
really
shine
in
a
beer
the
way
they
do
here
so
i
really
appreciate
the
effort
but
as
a
guy
who
loves
the
diversity
of
apples
on
the
planet
i
wish
this
beer
had
more
character
o
its
good
it
tastes
good
i
am
disappointed
am
i
wrong
to
want
more
complexity
something
else
going
on
not
something
i
am
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
o
excellent
brew
the
fruit
is
balanced
nice
with
the
malt
normally
id
be
disappointed
by
the
absence
of
hops
but
not
with
this
one
i
love
this
beer
this
will
forever
remain
on
my
wants
list
662011
overall
a
savory
drink
very
clean
apples
with
a
nice
finish
i
really
like
the
concept
but
i
wish
they
would
have
increased
the
malt
and
hop
profile
to
make
it
a
bit
more
well
rounded
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
tastes
more
like
apple
cider
than
a
beer
a
great
apple
cider
but
wished
it
had
more
of
a
balance
o
goes
down
very
easy
tasty
not
filling
low
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
isnt
a
beer
its
a
great
lil
drink
though
i
feel
more
goes
in
the
line
of
cider
than
beer
but
i
would
hit
it
up
again
a
buddy
brought
home
a
bunch
of
unplugged
beer
from
new
glarus
the
unplugged
apple
ale
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
apple
pie
i
get
all
of
the
notes
i
expect
with
some
cinnamon
apple
and
bready
notes
the
flavor
also
doesnt
disappoint
i
get
cinnamon
apple
and
crust
notes
this
beer
tastes
like
an
apple
pie
awesome
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
there
are
lots
of
breweries
out
there
but
i
dont
think
anyone
does
fruit
beers
better
than
our
friends
from
wisconsin
easy
drinking
and
tasty
overall
this
is
as
advertised
nothing
that
blows
me
away
but
nothing
that
makes
me
run
back
for
more
overall
i
dont
know
how
new
glarus
does
it
but
their
fruit
beers
are
great
this
is
another
success
from
this
brewery
i
would
have
another
cheers
o
very
close
to
a
cider
and
another
very
enjoyable
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
i
have
to
imagine
that
the
apple
qualities
of
this
beer
have
faded
over
the
past
several
months
at
this
point
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
and
sweet
drink
albeit
one
thats
a
tier
below
other
new
glarus
offerings
of
the
style
i
love
everything
from
new
glarus
im
fortunate
to
have
loving
relatives
in
wisconsin
but
would
love
to
have
more
regular
access
to
their
offerings
very
solid
lighter
beer
and
very
unique
owow
so
good
liquid
mcdonalds
apple
pie
another
very
nice
beer
in
the
unplugged
series
even
given
my
excellent
experiences
with
new
glarus
i
wondered
how
they
would
end
up
capturing
apple
in
a
beer
to
get
to
the
point
they
didnt
disappoint
this
is
straight
up
the
most
excellent
applesauce
youve
had
in
your
life
in
a
beer
spicy
apples
in
the
nose
spicy
apples
in
an
ephemeral
taste
this
is
delicious
and
might
even
trump
the
cranbic
im
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
within
a
manymile
radius
of
it
o
this
is
awesome
i
love
it
and
wish
i
had
better
access
to
new
glarus
really
interesting
brew
a
bit
of
a
novelty
but
definitely
something
unique
and
neat
to
try
redone
for
2012
tasted
less
like
apple
juice
and
more
like
a
beer
increased
the
review
a
terrific
little
brew
here
one
of
the
best
most
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
the
light
abv
is
incredibly
refreshing
had
a
bottle
of
this
from
an
extra
in
a
trade
pours
a
ciderlike
amber
color
a
thin
whispy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
this
wreaks
of
apples
in
a
good
way
wow
the
taste
is
pure
apples
and
some
spice
almost
like
a
sparkling
apple
cider
but
you
know
this
is
a
beer
when
you
drink
it
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
effervescent
you
cant
wait
for
the
next
face
full
of
this
stuff
cant
wait
to
have
more
o
pretty
one
dimensional
tasting
beer
but
overall
really
tasty
i
love
new
glarus
fruitvegetable
beers
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
i
cant
say
i
would
want
to
drink
this
beer
more
than
once
a
month
but
on
a
cool
fall
day
this
sucker
would
be
completely
phenomenal
spot
on
o
ive
had
this
one
before
and
i
enjoy
it
immensely
every
time
this
is
a
great
beer
to
change
up
my
drinking
routine
and
get
me
out
of
a
rut
tastes
of
pure
apple
with
nice
carbonation
and
amazing
crispness
o
very
easy
drinking
thought
the
aroma
was
better
than
the
flavor
profile
and
wish
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
but
it
was
still
good
and
a
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
again
overall
awesome
to
see
beers
this
far
down
the
spectrum
of
sweetness
and
even
being
away
from
most
qualities
of
beer
youd
think
this
was
a
cider
though
after
a
few
sips
some
malt
comes
through
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
apple
pie
i
get
all
of
the
notes
i
expect
with
some
cinnamon
apple
and
bready
notes
the
flavor
also
doesnt
disappoint
i
get
cinnamon
apple
and
crust
notes
this
beer
tastes
like
an
apple
pie
awesome
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
there
are
lots
of
breweries
out
there
but
i
dont
think
anyone
does
fruit
beers
better
than
our
friends
from
wisconsin
o
not
a
bad
effort
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
around
i
will
caution
you
however
too
let
it
age
a
bit
before
drinking
the
scent
and
flavor
really
represent
themsleves
in
much
truer
fashion
yet
another
amazing
fruit
beer
by
new
glarus
they
make
some
of
the
best
fruit
beer
out
there
between
this
the
cranbic
ale
the
raspberry
tart
and
the
wisconsin
belgian
red
thanks
to
taturbo
for
this
one
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
do
much
but
form
a
ring
around
the
glass
not
much
lacing
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
pretty
good
aroma
of
apple
to
it
it
starts
to
smell
better
as
it
warms
up
the
taste
is
like
a
blend
of
cider
and
apple
juice
with
a
good
amount
of
spices
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
medium
bodied
and
had
a
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
cant
say
that
it
was
my
favorite
apple
flavored
beer
as
much
as
i
love
these
beers
i
think
it
was
a
little
too
tart
at
times
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
new
glarus
just
plain
rock
all
the
time
and
im
about
ready
to
declare
that
an
irrefutable
fact
i
employed
a
very
gentle
pour
resulting
in
mere
wisps
in
terms
of
head
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
lightbrown
with
amber
highlights
it
did
indeed
resemble
freshly
squeezed
apple
juice
nose
was
very
much
driven
by
the
apple
juice
employed
in
its
production
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
the
taste
was
of
lightly
spiced
apple
juice
if
i
had
the
proper
equipment
i
might
consider
heating
this
in
a
double
boiler
as
a
sort
of
mulled
cidertype
of
drink
finish
was
a
pleasant
admixture
of
apple
and
spice
the
latter
most
likely
cinnamon
very
tasty
cold
and
would
be
welcomed
as
a
hot
drink
also
o
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
offering
from
new
glarus
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
overall
new
glarus
continues
to
impress
their
takes
on
vedgie
beers
are
pretty
awesome
and
they
do
it
second
to
none
for
a
fan
of
apples
vedgie
beers
and
things
different
this
is
another
must
try
pours
a
crisp
reddish
brown
a
touch
of
white
head
the
pour
is
not
impressive
smells
heavily
of
apple
but
in
a
very
bland
boring
way
the
taste
is
considerably
better
lots
of
apple
and
a
touch
of
light
malts
the
apple
flavour
is
top
notch
solid
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
very
tasty
but
more
like
a
cider
than
anything
else
im
pleased
that
its
not
full
of
apple
pie
spices
very
good

slightly
all
over

board
and
apple

apples
are
the
only
smell
from
this
beer
and
to
be
honest
it
doesnt
even
smell
the
slightest
bit
alcoholic
taste
is
of
all
of
the
apple
products
in
the
smell
along
with
some
spice
flavors
that
remind
me
of
apple
pie
carbonation
level
is
fairly
high
which
makes
for
a
crisp

bit
too
sweet
to
just
quaff
away
but
if
i
could
get
this
more
easily
i
probably
would
buy
some
occasionally
too
much
cherry
for
me
nice
flavor
not
too
fruity
still
tastes
like
a
beer
better
than
the
leinenkugel
berry
weiss
that
is
too
sweet
really
delicious
beer
very
fruity
if
i
wanted
an
applecranberry
juice
i
would
have
stolen
my
kids
lunch
juice
boxes
and
added
soda
water
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
these
ng
fruited
drinks
taste
more
like
cider
than
beer
my
wife
and
motherinlaw
would
love
it
loved
this
beer
tastes
like
sweetarts
in
a
good
way
total
4150
pour
is
a
hazy
reddish
copper
with
a
light
tan
bubbly
head
nose
is
strong
red
apple
lots
of
cherry
and
a
faint
touch
of
cranberry
taste
has
a
good
bit
of
red
apple
moderate
cherries
like
cranberries
and
a
moderate
touch
of
sourness
light
body
strong
carb
dry
finish
fruits
are
extremely
bright
and
really
play
well
together
certainly
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
struck
me
as
a
bit
simple
and
one
dimensional
and
was
not
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
wanting
to
buy
again
aroma
of
apples
predominantly
but
some
cherries
present
initial
flavor
is
a
healthy
mix
of
apples
and
cherries
cranberries
are
in
the
finish
and
resemble
the
dried
fruit
variety
texture
and
all
surprisingly
not
tart
but
more
on
the
sweet
side
very
good
stuff
by
far
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
had
you
can
taste
the
cherries
apples
and
cranberries
that
blend
beautifully
i
am
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
person
but
this
blew
my
socks
off
sure
wish
i
could
get
a
keg
of
this
just
amazing
not
only
is
this
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
tasted
its
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
at
4
and
under
i
cant
believe
how
much
flavor
got
jammed
into
this
bottle
i
cant
remember
dropping
a
score
this
high
in
a
long
time
i
want
another
this
beer
was
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
see
how
people
would
like
it
simple
but
amazing
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
as
expected
sooo
drinkable
and
tasty
no
sour
funk
here
just
pure
fruit
goodness
if
a
pantheon
of
straightup
fruit
beers
existed
it
would
be
raspberry
tart
wisconsin
belgian
red
and
serendipity
i
hope
that
new
glarus
keeps
this
fruit
beer
tradition
alive
for
all
of
existence
apple
and
cherries
coat
the
palate
with
intensity
and
it
lingers
beautifully
this
is
fruit
beer
overall
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
hands
down
i
love
the
sweettart
balance
along
with
how
each
fruit
profile
plays
together
so
well
on
the
palate
if
im
ever
in
new
glarus
neighborhood
im
making
time
to
visit
and
trying
their
other
fruit
offerings
wisconsin
initially
a
cherry
sweetness
hits
meandering
into
cranberry
tartness
in
the
finish
pretty
dense
body
with
strong
carbonation
sweet
overall
attenuation
isnt
a
priority
here
syrupy
for
sure
the
apple
might
be
adding
to
the
cranberry
finish
if
were
dealing
with
crabapples
or
green
apple
flavors
its
hard
to
tell
it
tastes
like
awesome
crancherry
fruit
juice
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
i
could
see
this
as
the
best
syrup
in
a
great
berlinerweisse
on
its
own
this
is
a
great
dessert
after
a
hefty
pot
roast
or
thanksgiving
dinner
its
not
crazy
complex
but
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
fruit
beer
cannot
get
enough
of
this
never
get
tired
the
right
amount
of
fruit
and
tartness
the
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
is
has
a
great
taste
and
feel
on
all
parts
of
the
tongue
bravo
o
i
really
love
this
beer
such
a
wonderful
unique
flavor
for
a
beer
and
it
gets
even
better
and
more
juicy
as
it
warms
my
only
complaint
is
the
same
one
that
people
in
49
states
have
that
its
only
available
in
wisconsin
overall
this
beer
is
a
world
class
fruit
beer
it
gives
you
that
juicy
tart
fruit
without
overdoing
the
overlysweet
aspects
that
most
fruit
beers
fall
victim
to
new
glarus
has
wowed
me
again
and
i
actually
prefer
this
to
the
raspberry
tart
cheers
o
very
good
fruit
beer
i
see
how
this
bought
multiple
different
fruits
together
to
meld
something
simple
yet
satisfying
i
prefer
belgian
red
to
this
but
i
prefer
this
to
raspberry
tart
hard
to
go
wrong
really
new
glarus
serendipity
4
55
this
is
absolutely
delicious
its
a
lightly
carbonated
fruit
punch
spiked
with
wild
yeast
o
amazing
cherry
and
apple
flavors
great
beer
overall
this
among
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
that
ive
had
and
enjoyed
more
than
thoroughly
the
reason
being
that
it
has
those
fruit
juice
characteristics
im
a
sucker
for
fresh
squeezed
juice
and
this
is
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
it
from
something
pertaining
to
the
beer
world
how
new
glarus
manages
to
hide
all
the
malt
character
of
the
beer
is
beyond
me
but
im
glad
they
succeed
as
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
that
display
a
malt
backbone
o
this
is
another
outstanding
fruit
beer
by
the
experts
at
new
glarus
ive
now
had
all
but
raspberry
tart
on
deck
for
another
day
and
i
havent
been
let
down
by
any
of
them
overy
tasty
and
very
sweet
something
you
gotta
crave
in
my
opinion
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
could
but
i
would
not
go
crazy
chasing
it
deff
worth
the
12
a
bomber
i
want
to
try
other
ng
offerings
a
little
less
on
the
sweeter
side
my
favorite
fruit
beer
sweet
apple
and
some
tart
cherries
really
nicely
balanced
love
how
juicy
this
is
without
tasting
just
like
regular
fruit
juice
great
body
for
a
4
fruit
beer
too
this
is
beyond
amazing
the
best
fruit
bier
from
new
glarus
and
thats
saying
a
lot
just
sublime
each
and
every
time
i
have
this
its
a
treat
ive
been
in
love
with
this
one
since
it
was
released
and
i
have
no
idea
why
ive
never
reviewed
it
before
its
just
perfect
o
this
is
probably
my
2nd
favorite
ng
fruit
beer
behind
strawberry
rhubarb
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
without
much
issue
would
like
to
try
to
age
one
of
these
further
as
it
is
the
only
sour
fruit
beer
in
their
line
up
pours
dark
red
two
finger
bone
head
smell
is
loaded
with
cranberry
cherry
and
apple
of
corse
tastes
of
the
same
fruit
but
also
honey
and
fairly
sweet
as
expected
there
is
little
carbonation
and
the
texture
is
not
thin
overall
this
is
very
well
done
loaded
with
fruit
flavor
and
not
super
complex
just
really
delicious
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
how
its
not
overly
sweet
and
not
syrupy
t
very
similar
to
the
smell
which
is
a
really
good
thing
theres
just
so
much
fruit
juice
packed
into
this
thing
its
incredible
tons
of
apple
cider
with
a
lot
of
juicy
red
cherry
and
cranberry
juice
cocktail
thrown
in
for
good
measure
a
hint
of
ripe
pear
fruit
leather
and
red
apple
skin
on
the
finish
just
enough
carbonation
to
break
up
the
sweetness
though
it
could
maybe
do
with
just
a
touch
more
this
is
the
most
fruit
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
i
really
love
this
stuff
overall
a
very
nice
sour
ale
i
was
lucky
to
try
overall
awesome
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
fruity
juice
with
acid
nice
sweetness
to
balance
all
the
fruit
juice
without
getting
too
sweet
like
some
of
hte
other
new
glarus
beers
good
apply
cherry
and
cranberry
fruits
faintest
hint
of
oak
that
i
kinda
wish
was
a
bit
more
bottle
poured
a
hazy
deep
reddish
color
ale
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
minor
lacing
aroma
of
cherry
and
sweet
apple
pie
is
out
of
this
world
and
pretty
closed
to
being
perfect
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
apple
pie
notes
with
some
sweet
cherry
notes
and
light
malt
presence
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
almost
veered
into
juice
category
but
in
a
really
good
way
overall
a
really
excellent
beer
i
wish
i
lived
closer
to
the
wisconsin
border
so
i
could
pick
this
up
again
incredible
that
this
is
actually
beer
i
dont
taste
any
malts
or
hops
just
the
giant
basket
of
fruit
that
went
into
each
bottle
o
really
tasty
shys
away
from
the
malt
and
hops
but
delivers
a
nice
lambic
quality
o
overal
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
o
overall
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
overly
sweet
no
cloy
aspects
basically
drinks
like
a
glass
of
cherry
apple
juice
with
some
cranberry
insanely
tasty
in
the
end
a
good
treat
and
very
memorable
although
it
doesnt
quite
qualify
as
a
musthave
beer
for
me
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
a
little
more
tartness
or
a
little
less
sweet
and
it
would
be
near
perfect
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
had
recommended
overall
what
a
fabulous
beer
this
not
my
typical
style
but
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
everyone
needs
to
try
this
gem
tastes
crisp
and
crisply
tart
cherries
and
apples
and
the
great
lakes
at
the
tail
end
of
summer
love
love
loved
it
o
this
is
an
insane
concoction
that
i
am
falling
in
love
with
an
absolute
fruit
medley
bomb
that
goes
together
so
well
new
glarus
crushes
these
fruit
ales
and
i
am
in
love
o
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
of
different
flavors
throughout
just
the
type
of
complexity
i
like
to
taste
in
beers
tasty
and
a
lot
more
complex
than
their
other
awesome
fruit
beers
thats
for
sure
o
ultra
sweet
to
the
point
that
it
got
a
bit
too
much
to
drink
after
a
while
greats
flavors
though
could
be
drier
extremely
rich
overall
a
must
try
beer
this
is
a
very
wellmade
fruit
beer
with
a
sourness
that
is
pleasant
the
fruits
taste
very
real
and
fresh
a
solid
malt
backing
gives
balance
and
support
very
enjoyable
far
above
the
typical
american
fruit
beer
imo
new
glarus
makes
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
never
had
a
bad
one
or
even
a
mediocre
one
from
them
would
i
drink
it
again
i
sure
would
its
probably
a
good
thing
that
i
dont
live
in
wi
because
is
be
drinking
their
fruit
beers
all
the
time
pours
a
fairly
clear
pinkish
amber
color
with
a
with
a
huge
bubbly
pink
tinged
head
that
persists
forever
the
aroma
is
sweet
tart
and
fruity
tart
and
sweet
cherries
with
bits
of
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
apple
cider
and
tart
berries
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
oak
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
but
the
tart
and
fruitiness
from
the
berries
and
apples
counter
that
nicely
very
subtle
woody
vanilla
flavors
round
this
one
out
nicely
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
light
syrupy
mouthfeel
nice
brew
i
would
have
really
liked
a
bit
more
tartness
but
i
still
had
no
problem
enjoying
this
one
overall
easily
the
best
straight
up
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
not
super
complex
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
the
beer
is
a
canvas
with
which
to
showcase
the
fruit
and
it
does
it
almost
perfectly
this
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
to
stock
up
on
and
drink
during
the
summer
overall
freaking
great
a
fruit
ale
with
complexity
very
tasty
some
have
not
liked
this
as
much
as
the
cherry
or
raspberry
versions
this
is
every
bit
as
good
if
not
better
a
wonderful
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
dmbforever
poured
into
an
8oz
snifter
red
amber
brown
in
color
with
cream
colored
head
decent
head
retention
about
a
minute
and
a
half
decent
lacing
and
the
head
shows
back
up
with
each
swirl
aroma
of
dark
sweet
fruit
raspberry
cherry
tart
apple
aroma
also
has
some
slight
funk
to
it
like
earthy
yeastiness
taste
is
of
cherries
raspberry
some
plum
and
blackberry
as
well
very
sweet
the
tart
cranberries
are
nice
but
they
dont
cut
the
sweetness
as
much
as
id
like
good
carbonation
and
medium
body
wrap
the
tongue
in
the
fruit
sweetness
definitely
another
enjoyable
brew
from
new
glarus
overall
this
might
be
the
king
of
fullon
fruit
beers
as
with
any
fruit
beer
there
is
considerable
sweetness
but
this
one
uses
the
combination
of
fruits
to
balance
the
sweetness
with
some
cleaner
drier
flavors
i
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
were
it
to
fall
into
my
lap
shared
a
bottle
of
this
ridiculousness
with
the
wife
needless
to
say
with
word
of
it
taking
a
hiatus
shortly
i
high
tailed
over
to
wisconsin
to
stock
up
cranberry
and
cherry
hit
you
in
waves
at
the
same
time
theres
never
any
mistake
this
is
beer
not
fruit
juice
not
a
wine
cooler
fantastic
stuff
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
also
the
best
chick
beer
extant
if
you
are
drinking
fruit
beer
and
its
not
new
glarus
you
are
missing
out
the
palate
opens
with
the
bite
of
cranberries
tart
and
refreshing
before
segueing
into
the
cherry
and
apple
flavors
the
apple
character
is
a
blend
of
sweet
and
mildly
tart
apples
a
blend
of
gala
and
pink
lady
apples
i
am
tempted
to
imagine
the
cherry
character
is
a
blend
of
dark
red
and
near
black
cherries
a
deep
fleshy
flavor
behind
all
of
this
is
a
mild
malt
sweetness
a
blend
of
caramel
and
a
little
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
vanilla
is
also
perceived
medium
in
body
and
with
a
soft
creamy
carbonation
this
feels
nice
on
the
palate
just
a
touch
watery
on
the
finish
the
dominant
lingering
flavor
is
apple
beautiful
stuff
this
is
more
cider
than
beer
imo
very
highly
recommended
this
one
pours
a
ruby
hued
amber
color
there
was
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
much
lacing
the
nose
is
good
it
almost
smells
like
fruit
juice
but
not
as
sweet
cherry
apple
and
cranberries
are
the
most
notable
the
taste
is
also
very
good
there
is
a
tartness
and
sweetness
at
the
same
time
cherries
cranberry
and
apple
somewhat
lighter
body
this
is
interesting
and
wonderful

but
you
dont
even
realize
there
is
alcohol
in
this
o
this
is
exactly
what
i
like
in
a
fruit
beer
to
me
it
should
be
big
on
the
fruit
flavors
with
a
light
to
not
discernible
yeast
profile
unless
were
talkin
lambics
of
course
if
i
had
the
money
i
would
replace
soda
pop
with
this
stuff
and
keg
it
at
my
house
the
thing
the
surprised
me
most
was
how
balanced
all
three
fruit
flavors
are
look
forward
to
trying
more
new
glarus
offerings
in
the
future

o
it
is
serendipity
this
beer
is
indeed
the
happy
accident
that
new
glarus
was
hoping
for
i
dont
know
if
new
glarus
will
continue
to
brew
this
beer
seasonally
but
i
would
certainly
would
make
a
regular
purchase
of
this
beer
if
they
do
continue
to
produce
it
overall
if
you
are
interested
in
a
beer
that
will
bring
you
that
christmas
cheer
year
round
look
no
further
than
this
new
glarus
creation
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
the
balance
and
complexity
of
this
beer
is
second
to
none
so
whether
you
are
a
beer
veteran
or
new
to
the
club
its
almost
impossible
to
not
fall
in
love
with
serendipity
its
a
well
done
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
reminiscent
of
martinellis
apple
cider
thanks
to
cdmillard
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
pours
a
translucent
amber
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
bubbly
slick
nose
is
very
much
reminiscent
of
sucrets
medicinal
cherry
with
the
addition
of
ripe
red
apples
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
new
glarus
the
blend
of
fruits
is
really
quite
exceptional
but
i
dont
get
too
much
cranberry
although
i
suspect
that
its
contribution
was
the
medicinal
notes
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
bright
lively
carbonation
i
am
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
fan
but
new
glarus
always
hits
it
out
of
the
park
for
me
this
beer
is
so
flavorful
at
4
0
however
it
is
not
for
the
meek
as
it
is
really
quite
sweet
if
youve
experienced
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
youll
find
yourself
in
quite
a
familiar
realm
with
serendipity
but
this
beer
doesnt
only
piggy
back
on
their
successes
it
flourishes
with
new
and
delicious
fruit
experiences
serendipity
proves
once
again
dan
carey
is
an
expert
brewer
of
fruit
beer
pick
this
one
up
without
hesitation
and
be
rewarded
by
its
delicious
fruit
complexity
for
this
beer
without
question
will
be
another
awardwinning
beer
from
new
glarus
this
is
my
new
favorite
fruit
beer
from
ng
cheers
overall
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
just
right
if
i
traded
this
raspberry
tart
and
wisconsin
belgian
red
would
be
on
my
permanent
iso
list
i
could
drink
this
every
day
o
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
depth
to
the
fruit
flavor
and
a
great
freshness
to
it
the
intense
fruit
flavor
would
be
nice
in
smaller
bottles
would
absolutely
drink
this
beer
again
puckers
a
bit
on
the
finish
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
god
i
really
loved
this
thing
im
glad
i
still
have
another
bottle
and
im
debating
whether
to
open
it
or
not
any
time
soon
the
fruits
are
wonderfully
present
and
robust
here
as
they
should
be
and
the
funky
yeast
and
flavorful
oak
notes
really
add
extra
complexity
to
something
thats
already
wonderful
in
its
own
right
ng
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
fruitinfusing
breweries
in
the
country
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
them
soon
absolutely
amazing
fruit
ale
cherries
come
through
perfectly
and
up
front
both
on
the
nose
and
taste
impossibly
light
and
effervescent
this
ale
is
a
wonerful
start
or
finisher
to
an
evening
slightly
sour
and
tart
finish
that
lingers
cleanly
for
a
bit
real
cherry
soda
comes
to
mind
must
try
fan
of
fruit
ales
or
no
overall
cheerwine
with
alcohol
superb
outstanding
must
try
othe
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
o
too
sweet
as
mike
said
as
he
shared
this
with
me
if
you
put
it
in
little
cardboard
boxes
and
stuck
a
straw
in
it
you
could
feed
it
to
the
little
ones
goood
to
cut
a
berliner
wiesse
though
2
75
the
beer
appears
ruby
to
amber
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
the
aroma
brings
a
potent
dose
of
apples
pears
tart
cranberries
sweet
fruit
juices
a
typical
new
glarus
fruit
beer
bold
and
assertive
teeming
with
flavor
sweet
cherries
and
apples
with
minimal
alcohol
though
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
theres
no
denying
that
this
is
a
terrific
beer
fantastic
in
small
quantities
the
ale
is
quite
serendipitous
indeed
where
drier
belgian
sour
ales
often
loose
their
fruit
identity
and
the
sweeter
ones
are
sickly
this
improvised
ale
lands
right
between
for
full
fruit
appreciation
and
without
distracting
cloying
its
a
beautiful
beer
for
most
occasions
from
complements
to
summer
salads
to
the
most
esteemed
celebration
cheers
d
its
like
fruit
juice
really
easy
to
drink
although
its
a
tiny
bit
sweeter
than
i
prefer
its
like
a
blend
of
apple
ale
cranbic
and
belgian
red
glad
new
glarus
was
able
to
make
lemonade
out
of
lemons
in
regards
to
the
poor
cherry
harvest
o
a
plethora
of
mixed
berry
with
a
slight
cider
hint
to
it
with
the
apples
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
i
must
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
satisfying
beers
i
have
had
in
some
time
i
was
proven
completely
wrong
with
the
thoughts
of
mixed
fruit
and
low
alcohol
new
glarus
brewing
has
proven
once
again
to
be
one
of
the
best
fruit
beer
producers
in
the
world
o
a
fantastic
beer
hard
to
give
perfects
but
new
glarus
fruit
beers
have
proven
to
deserve
it
time
and
time
again
o
wow
im
very
surprised
i
new
it
was
going
to
be
good
but
i
dint
know
it
would
be
this
good
apple
cider
cherries
tartness
so
refreshing
fruity
goodness
my
favorite
of
all
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
pours
a
hazed
rusty
hue
with
copper
highlights
when
held
up
to
a
light
source
tan
head
with
nice
lacing
a
lot
of
fresh
apples
and
tart
cherries
on
the
nose
the
cranberry
is
noticeable
but
toned
down
compared
to
the
others
very
slight
hint
of
barrel
funk
just
like
the
nose
the
apples
and
cherries
make
up
a
big
part
of
the
overall
flavor
the
finish
is
slightly
tart
from
the
cherries
and
cranberries
with
a
touch
of
that
barrel
funk
that
was
in
the
nose
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
effervescent
with
small
bubbles
silky
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
very
tasty
and
not
a
big
departure
from
new
glaruss
other
fruit
beers
not
better
than
the
belgian
red
but
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
raspberry
tart
plenty
of
unique
points
on
this
one
plenty
light
on
its
feet
at
4
abv
a
great
morning
and
hot
weather
beer
plenty
earthy
too
good
for
blowing
minds
when
people
think
the
only
beer
is
bmc
aals
taste
very
sweet
and
tart
bold
acidity
and
spiciness
on
the
tongue
cranberry
cherry
and
apple
flavors
are
present
the
sourness
compliments
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
bad
sucker
is
something
that
raul
is
doing
and
he
wont
have
a
problem
doing
it
well
again
o
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
their
fruit
beers
more
complex
and
less
sweet
than
raspberry
tart
the
folks
at
new
glarus
are
masters
at
making
fruit
beers
and
this
offering
is
no
exception
although
some
might
be
put
off
by
this
beers
sweetness
and
seemingly
lack
of
beerlike
qualities
i
absolutely
loved
it
and
cannot
wait
to
see
what
other
accidents
happen
in
the
future
pours
a
deep
amber
to
faint
red
with
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
is
downright
unbelievable
as
advertised
sour
cherry
jumps
to
the
forefront
backed
up
by
notes
of
apple
and
cranberry
the
taste
is
follows
suit
with
pleasant
balance
sour
cherry
sweetness
and
tartness
along
with
apple
and
cranberry
theres
also
a
nice
fruity
spicy
heat
that
follows
in
the
aftertaste
the
profile
follows
well
and
is
probably
best
compared
to
ginger
ale
for
its
sharpness
it
thankfully
has
a
low
abv
4
0
or
else
id
likely
wind
up
face
down
on
a
sidewalk
somewhere
for
anyone
who
claims
to
hate
beer
id
recommend
this
in
order
to
convert
great
stuff
bottle
from
a
friend
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
off
white
two
finger
head
huge
bouquet
of
cranberry
and
cherry
sweet
and
tart
smelling
flavor
is
more
cherry
heavy
with
hints
of
the
cranberry
coming
through
very
sweet
slight
tart
more
medicinal
than
i
had
hoped
but
not
overwhelming
lingering
tart
cranberry
that
grows
on
me
while
i
go
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
cool
beer
but
not
as
good
as
raspberry
tart
o
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
good
but
not
this
good
i
never
knew
a
fruit
beer
could
taste
so
damn
complex
delicious
and
refreshing
kudos
to
new
glarus
for
making
the
worlds
finest
fruit
ales
o
awesome
fruit
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
the
raspberry
and
cherry
versions
but
its
a
very
close
3rd
pretty
amazing
that
one
brewery
can
make
the
top
3
fruit
beers
magic
touch
i
guess
wonderful
strong
flavors
from
only
4
abv
too
great
fruit
beer
o
new
glarus
simply
kills
it
with
their
fruit
beers
this
happy
accident
ale
certainly
is
a
happy
accident
belgian
red
really
impressed
me
and
making
up
for
the
lack
of
cherries
with
cranberries
and
apples
is
just
genius
just
the
right
amounts
of
sweetness
and
tartness
o
overall
very
good
fruit
beer
so
much
fruity
and
juicy
character
almost
seems
like
an
ocean
spray
juice
blend
more
than
a
beer
carbonation
is
light
contributing
to
the
juice
character
alcohol
is
not
existent
and
doesnt
even
show
its
minimal
4
at
all
another
outstanding
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
i
would
probably
takes
this
over
new
glarus
more
common
fruit
beers
hard
to
believe
this
was
an
accident
and
not
a
well
thought
out
and
planned
beer
sublimely
executed
nonetheless
and
all
in
a
low
abv
package
cheers
good
stuff
i
prefer
raspberry
tart
though
apples
are
coming
through
in
the
flavor
but
are
still
smothered
by
the
louder
and
sourer
berries
inside
deliciousness
indeed
o
i
like
this
better
than
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
but
which
seem
overly
sweet
and
one
dimensional
it
has
the
aspect
of
a
fruited
cider
which
is
interesting
but
the
drinkability
is
still
limited
by
the
sweet
jammyness
this
is
best
had
in
small
doses
copper
red
with
good
clarity
and
good
general
appearance
aroma
is
strong
on
apples
and
cherries
cant
really
comment
on
other
aspects
tastes
very
tart
but
the
apples
sure
are
noticeable
cranberries
are
tart
and
theres
ample
dose
of
cherry
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
full
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
clean
but
with
a
lasting
tartness
if
this
is
oak
aged
then
the
oak
is
present
only
in
the
tannins
but
i
am
not
sure
overall
its
a
very
good
fruit
beer
but
the
label
hints
that
it
should
be
an
american
wild
ale
the
taste
was
very
tart
like
cranberry
cocktail
juice
and
yet
very
sweet
i
noted
highlights
of
different
fruits
as
i
tasted
it
for
certain
there
were
cranberries
and
apples
while
it
was
fruity
it
had
a
nice
malty
background
which
is
a
reminder
to
me
that
its
a
beer
not
juice
nor
fruity
wine
its
a
1
pint
and
9
fluid
oz
bottle
yet
very
drinkable
and
i
did
not
share
this
there
wasnt
anyone
to
share
with
anyway
a
relaxing
beer
to
enjoy
both
during
the
day
its
only
4
abv
and
in
the
evening
hours
enjoy
o
as
good
as
any
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
including
the
finest
belgian
lambics
pours
a
clear
orangered
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
mainly
a
variety
of
sweet
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
fruity
presence
that
makes
it
super
drinkable
o
really
tasty
wouldnt
be
a
beer
that
i
would
choose
to
drink
every
day
but
at
the
right
time
and
the
right
situation
this
is
perfect
o
from
my
past
track
record
for
ng
brews
i
had
high
expectations
those
expectations
were
exceeded
marvelous
true
session
beer
pours
a
browned
pink
with
a
fleeting
dusty
rose
cap
smells
of
apples
cherries
oak
and
some
lactic
acid
taste
is
cranberry
well
balanced
with
apples
and
cherries
the
beer
leans
toward
the
tart
side
of
things
and
helps
the
flavor
profiles
balance
out
like
a
well
blended
wine
there
is
a
medium
on
lightly
cloying
body
with
moderate
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
that
makes
me
want
the
beer
ice
cold
and
in
gulping
portions
on
a
early
summer
morning
really
a
refreshing
beer
i
believe
to
be
an
absolutely
fantastic
deviation
from
the
normal
new
glarus
beers
o
excellent
fruit
beer
i
think
this
is
the
best
one
that
new
glarus
has
made
its
like
a
mix
of
the
apple
ale
the
cranbic
and
the
belgian
red
all
three
flavors
work
together
quite
nicely
apple
is
the
dominate
flavor
but
they
all
play
off
one
another
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
on
the
regular
overall
perfect
fruit
beer
wow
new
glarus
again
knocks
this
completely
out
of
the
park
perfect
for
a
spring
afternoon
serendipity
is
considered
a
fruitsour
beer
and
you
can
definitely
get
the
tartness
from
this
brew
the
flavors
of
all
the
fruits
really
do
a
number
on
your
taste
buds
and
the
beer
pairs
perfectly
with
brownies
chocolate
cake
or
even
makes
a
great
dessert
on
its
own
o
i
think
a
lot
of
people
that
dont
like
beer
would
love
this
i
am
not
crazy
about
it
but
i
appreciate
all
the
hard
work
and
craftsmanship
in
making
this
new
glarus
puts
out
some
real
good
fruit
beers
i
liked
apple
ale
slightly
more
o
im
moving
to
wisconsin
after
i
retire
o
the
only
fruit
beer
ive
ever
enjoyed
not
truly
a
cider
but
not
a
lambic
simply
a
nice
and
unique
offering
from
a
midwest
favorite
bottle

shared
at
the
march
2013
tasting
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
dazzling
ruby
amber
color
with
a
disappearing
white
fizz
explosive
cherry
aroma
with
some
sharp
tartness
to
it
immediately
similar
to
jolly
ranchers
flavor
is
revelatory
as
is
the
case
with
most
ng
fruit
beers
an
absolute
barrage
of
concentrated
fruit
madness
cherries
make
up
the
major
flavor
component
candysweet
but
naturaltasting
with
a
base
of
ice
cider
apple
flesh
and
a
perfect
cranberry
bite
on
the
finish
rounding
out
the
immense
sweetness
with
a
divine
tartness
this
is
easily
on
par
with
belgian
red
et
al
and
arguably
better
due
to
the
complexity
and
synergy
thereof
serendipity
indeed
pours
a
transparent
roseamber
color
with
a
handsome
head
of
fine
khaki
froth
splotchy
lacing
clings
handsomely
to
the
glass
as
the
beer
recedes
the
aroma
smells
strongly
of
green
apple
and
cherry
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
pretty
comparable
to
the
nose
with
the
sourness
taking
center
stage
up
front
before
a
mild
honeylike
sweetness
comes
through
on
the
back
end
the
first
sip
really
is
delightfully
puckering
i
dont
taste
the
cranberry
so
much
per
se
rather
it
synergizes
seamlessly
with
the
other
fruits
the
cranberry
actually
seems
to
come
through
a
bit
more
as
the
beer
warms
a
tingly
ascetic
sourness
asserts
itself
in
the
finish
kept
vital
by
the
perky
carbonation
a
distinct
cinnamon
flavor
adds
an
extra
element
that
keeps
the
melange
from
becoming
too
fruity
in
spite
of
the
bold
flavor
the
finish
manages
to
remain
mostly
dry
this
really
is
a
fantastic
sour
ale
that
never
becomes
cloying
in
spite
of
its
flavorful
character
another
winning
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus

drops
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
apple
raspberry
cherry
and
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
am
a
really
big
fan
of
new
glarus
other
offerings
and
this
one
was
no
exception
tons
of
sweetness
without
being
too
sweet
tons
of
fruit
without
being
too
fruity
there
is
just
so
much
going
on
in
this
one
with
a
nice
balance
to
top
it
off
that
it
makes
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
a
true
must
try
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
raspberry
tart
or
belgian
red
you
wont
regret
it
o
new
glarus
knows
how
to
make
fantastic
fruit
beers
this
is
no
exception
o
walks
a
fine
line
between
sweet
and
tart
a
good
beer
i
was
incorrectly
expecting
something
closer
to
a
wild
ale
and
this
is
most
definitely
a
fruit
beer
period
refreshing
stuff
this
now
this
is
how
you
do
a
fruit
beer
throw
an
apple
some
cherries
and
a
few
cranberries
into
a
blender
bottle
it
up
and
call
it
serendipity
almost
perfect
execution
of
pure
fruit
flavors
while
avoiding
all
of
the
offputting
sideeffect
that
commonly
plague
this
style
of
beer
new
glarus
i
like
them
a
lot
on
par
with
all
of
the
other
new
glares
fruit
beers
all
about
the
fruit
with
some
good
tart
sourness
but
little
to
no
funk
if
someone
says
they
dont
like
this
beer
their
lying
d
obscenely
drinkable
a
great
beer
from
new
glarus
id
gladly
have
it
again
if
id
be
so
lucky
a
damn
fine
fruit
beer
seriously
impeccable
new
glarus
performs
fruit
alchemy
this
is
fruity
and
sweet
without
being
overly
sweet
its
like
fruit
salad
with
apples
cranberries
and
cherries
except
better
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
o
wonderful
sour
nothing
overwhelming
in
any
flavor
blended
excellently
in
the
oak
perfect
for
an
after
dinner
desert
beer
my
only
downfall
is
id
most
likely
only
drink
one
of
these
o
a
smooth
fruit
beer
that
goes
down
well
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
two
glasses
of
this
with
the
sweetness
factor
i
wish
it
had
more
tartness
to
offset
the
sweet
cherryapple
flavors
o
overall
just
wow
new
glarus
really
owns
the
vedgie
beer
category
if
only
they
would
distribute
im
just
amazed
by
each
and
every
one
of
these
that
they
churn
out
o
serendipidelicious
honestly
this
is
an
awesome
fruit
beer
and
a
perfectly
complimentary
offering
along
with
belgian
red
and
wisconsin
o
a
solid
fruit
beer
the
cherryberry
flavors
are
very
nice
its
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
still
worth
picking
up
o
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
pretty
good
and
i
can
recognize
a
good
beer
when
i
see
and
taste
one
m
light
to
medium
solely
because
of
the
fruit
and
sweetness
other
than
that
light
beer
o
new
glarus
made
a
great
fruit
beer
no
way
seriously
if
you
like
this
style
you
cant
go
wrong
with
anything
they
do
4
5
overall
i
want
more
of
this
beer
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
in
the
summer
its
simple
yet
complex
refreshing
and
light
the
perfect
fruit
beer
overall
new
glarus
seems
to
have
some
sort
of
secret
to
making
fruit
beers
that
no
one
else
knows
really
not
a
style
i
usually
enjoy
but
ive
loved
all
of
new
glaruss
offerings
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
raspberry
tart
and
belgian
red
it
does
get
a
little
overwhelming
after
a
while
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
whole
750
but
splitting
a
bottle
is
perfect
drink
for
something
so
different
this
was
a
great
tasting
beer
a
good
amount
of
balanced
fruits
and
then
some
oak
behind
it
not
sure
belongs
in
top
250
but
i
drove
to
freaking
wi
to
get
it
between
this
beer
raspberry
tart
and
belgian
red
i
think
this
is
my
new
favorite
the
carbonation
is
not
as
strong
as
belgian
red
and
the
sour
note
as
not
as
overwhelming
as
raspberry
tart
i
really
hope
serendipity
sticks
around
for
a
while
this
is
a
medium
bodied
offering
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
very
easy
drinking
with
the
alcohol
seemingly
nonexistent
my
only
gripe
is
the
medicinal
aspect
that
pokes
out
at
times
but
overall
this
is
pretty
good
you
get
everything
as
advertised
in
this
cherry
cranberry
and
apple
in
equal
parts
i
am
impressed
but
this
isnt
something
i
would
drink
regularly
overall
these
new
glarus
offerings
blur
the
line
between
sodas
and
beer
i
cant
in
good
conscience
rate
it
as
a
great
beer
no
matter
how
tasty
it
is
tastes
a
little
medicinal
super
sweet
rough
actually
not
a
very
good
beer
not
on
the
same
level
as
belgian
red
or
raspberry
tart
not
a
repeat
pour
yields
a
reddishbrown
colored
brew
with
a
short
fizzy
head
that
recedes
somewhat
quickly
the
nose
carries
a
strong
bit
of
cherry
and
cranberry
as
well
as
underlying
earthiness
some
tartness
coming
through
as
well
as
fruit
skin
flavor
is
moderately
tart
but
has
far
too
much
underlying
sweetness
body
is
medium
and
appropriate
but
theres
too
much
residual
sweetness
coming
through
pretty
nice
for
a
fruit
beer
but
pales
in
comparison
to
belgian
red
and
to
a
lesser
degree
raspberry
tart
poured
a
clear
ruby
red
color
with
tints
of
amber
and
a
small
fizzy
pinkwhite
head
that
dissipated
almost
completely
fruit
juice
aroma
obvious
apple
lesser
notes
of
berry
fruit
punch
taste
was
fresh
and
brilliant
apple
juice
cranrazz
mostly
sweet
but
a
bit
of
tartness
in
there
as
well
along
with
maybe
a
subtle
touch
of
spice
but
the
apple
flavor
was
clearly
in
charge
here
lightmedium
body
juicy
effervescent
and
overall
quite
enjoyable
im
not
sure
id
want
to
take
on
a
full
bottle
myself
andor
significant
quantities
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
definitely
great
in
small
quantities
crazy
ruby
tones
with
an
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
nose
of
cranberry
and
apple
pie
some
cherry
sucker
character
as
well
all
three
fruits
are
surprisingly
well
represented
sweet
malt
but
fruits
are
huge
taste
has
all
of
the
fruits
well
represented
some
pie
filling
jammy
and
jolly
rancherlollipop
flavours
of
the
fruits
in
this
brew
medium
feel
moderate
sweetness
and
some
effervescence
the
careys
hit
it
out
of
the
park
again
a
lovely
treat
from
new
glarus
this
one
was
made
thanks
to
a
cherry
shortage
so
cranberries
and
apples
are
added
to
account
for
the
diminished
cherry
crop
the
result
is
quite
pleasant
and
perfect
for
holiday
season
the
pour
is
raspberry
looking
pink
in
color
maybe
a
little
darker
with
a
few
fingers
of
fizzy
white
froth
the
nose
is
remarkably
sweet
like
fruit
candy
but
also
tart
a
sour
beer
for
sure
yeast
is
interestingly
balanced
out
by
the
fruit
smells
like
sour
granola
the
taste
is
cranberry
and
sour
yeast
tartness
at
first
and
then
gently
gives
way
to
a
holiday
spice
complex
of
apple
and
cinnamon
and
warming
mulling
spices
the
spice
then
dies
out
and
a
ton
of
residual
sugar
is
left
over
this
exacerbates
as
it
warms
great
feel
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
made
even
lighter
and
more
airy
by
the
thin
malt
profile
and
the
low
abv
a
lot
like
the
raspberry
tart
in
the
sense
that
i
dont
need
a
whole
750ml
bottle
of
this
for
myself
but
it
was
a
joy
to
try
i
hope
for
plentiful
cherry
crops
but
i
also
hope
this
beer
stays
in
the
lineup
a
really
nice
compliment
to
some
of
their
other
fruit
beers
the
champaigne
mouthfeel
goes
perfectly
with
the
fruit
and
the
sour
well
done
o
glad
they
made
this
one
i
really
enjoy
these
low
abv
fruit
beers
m
medium
body
creamy
light
carbonation
overall
a
nice
fruit
brew
but
i
do
enjoy
the
fruits
in
rt
and
wbr
more
more
a
personal
preference
thing
than
the
quality
of
the
brew
o
just
another
excellent
fruit
beer
from
dan
with
an
already
excellent
portfolio
of
them
yet
this
one
stands
out
and
tastes
so
smooth
and
juicy
o
not
bad
at
all
i
really
liked
this
one
o
ive
come
to
realize
that
im
personally
not
a
big
fan
of
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
they
are
just
all
overpoweringly
sweet
and
not
that
enjoyable
for
me
this
beer
had
a
ton
of
flavor
its
just
the
sweetness
makes
it
almost
undrinkable
i
probably
wont
be
having
this
beer
again
and
im
surprised
so
many
people
like
it
id
recommend
it
only
if
you
like
sweet
and
fruity
beers
doesnt
impress
me
as
much
as
the
other
new
glarus
fruit
beers
flavor
feels
a
bit
bloated
and
less
clean
because
of
the
presence
of
all
those
fruits
and
i
really
want
some
tart
or
sour
to
balance
out
that
sweetness
amazing
mouthfeel
pours
a
toffee
caramel
rustic
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
but
doesnt
fully
disappear
nose
is
apples
cherries
and
the
belgian
spicy
notes
similar
to
the
belgian
red
the
taste
starts
with
a
little
bit
of
lemon
that
moves
on
to
the
bombardment
of
fruits
cherries
and
apples
are
upfront
and
move
on
to
a
soft
cranberry
flavor
mixed
in
with
the
spicy
ng
yeast
strain
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
overall
this
is
another
fantastic
fruit
beer
from
ng
glad
i
got
to
drink
up
some
belgian
red
this
weekend
but
this
makes
a
fine
substitute
im
so
glad
the
harvest
was
short
on
cherries
because
this
beer
is
the
best
fruit
beer
so
far
for
me
i
got
3
bottles
and
i
forced
myself
to
hide
the
other
two
as
they
are
just
too
tempting
right
now
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beer
experiences
as
well
new
glarus
has
a
great
thing
going
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
extra
tartness
helps
keep
the
beer
from
getting
too
sweet
which
is
my
main
complaint
about
the
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
miles
better
than
either
of
those
and
i
hope
this
becomes
a
staple
o
i
enjoyed
this
just
as
much
or
more
than
the
belgian
red
this
one
is
a
little
bit
more
sour
and
tart
but
the
flavors
really
blend
together
nicely
after
drinking
this
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
clean
and
clear
ruby
color
and
it
is
capped
by
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lace
a
big
fruitcocktail
of
a
nose
features
apple
and
cherry
prominently
with
hints
of
cranberry
dancing
between
sweet
and
sour
whiffs
amazing
nose
the
palate
receives
much
of
the
same
treatment
with
flavors
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
tart
dark
fruit
cranberries
apple
and
a
touch
of
oak
creating
a
wonderfully
refreshing
and
tart
flavor
experience
silky
in
the
mouth
serendipity
is
mediumlight
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
happy
accident
indeed
bummer
about
the
cherry
shortage
putting
belgian
red
on
hold
but
ive
been
anxious
to
try
this
replacement
brew
new
glarus
makes
fantastic
beers
showcasing
each
of
these
three
fruits
cherry
apple
cranberry
so
its
no
surprise
this
motley
crue
of
a
beer
delivers
an
assault
of
flavor
cranberry
seems
most
prominent
and
provides
a
real
nice
tartness
happy
to
have
more
of
these
bottles
in
the
cellar
light
orange
red
active
bubbles
no
foam
fruity
smell
mixture
of
apples
cherries
cranberries
malty
backbone
tart
flavor
throughout
fades
out
tart
close
light
and
flavorful
super
fruity
really
good
fresh
crisp
cranberry
plays
the
lead
role
blueberry
and
apple
type
flavors
beneath
that
its
fruit
and
its
beer
its
delectable
a
notes
this
light
to
moderatebodied
brew
has
a
tart
but
not
overly
dry
mouthfeel
serendipity
is
a
fruit
beer
with
very
few
flaws
as
with
most
of
the
offerings
from
new
glarus
this
brew
is
stunning
and
i
will
certainly
be
seeking
out
more
bottles
cheers
to
the
brewery
for
this
fine
effort
this
is
a
very
good
fruit
beer
very
nice
fruit
sweetness
and
good
tartness
the
fruit
flavors
all
blend
together
quite
well

an
excellent
one
from
new
glarus
kinda
glad
there
was
a
cherry
shortage
in
order
to
have
this
honestly
not
that
different
from
belgian
red
but
it
is
slightly
less
artificial
candy
tasting
and
more
on
the
delicious
sweet
fruit
sugars
o
what
can
i
say
yet
another
excellent
fruit
beer
from
dan
and
deb
this
was
great
in
fact
i
think
i
like
it
better
than
either
of
the
wi
belgian
red
or
rasp
tart
come
on
guys
wi
is
the
bounceberry
capital
of
the
u
s
make
this
a
regular
the
beer
pours
a
clear
cranberry
red
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
around
the
beers
circumference
the
nose
is
very
pleasant
boasting
notes
of
ripe
apples
cranberries
and
the
new
glarus
house
yeast
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
nearly
as
cloying
as
belgian
red
or
razz
tart
the
apple
sweetness
and
slight
cranberry
tartness
works
well
with
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
tart
sweet
yet
well
attenuated
and
very
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
winner
something
id
try
again
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
has
a
slightly
tart
and
sweet
aftertaste
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
buy
this
beer
or
trade
for
it
if
you
get
the
chance
true
to
form
its
another
superb
fruit
beer
by
new
glarus
its
extremely
drinkable
and
complex
overall
this
is
is
a
great
beer
my
roommate
picked
it
up
for
me
definitely
a
good
choice
i
guess
this
was
a
oneoff
because
of
the
drought
and
low
crop
of
cherries
this
past
season
but
its
a
great
oneoff
way
to
make
lemonade
out
of
lemons
new
glarus
or
serendipity
out
of
apples
ahhh
get
it
o
this
is
a
world
class
beer
for
anyone
from
the
most
novice
beer
drinker
to
a
seasoned
vet
this
is
a
beer
anyone
can
drink
and
say
damn
that
tastes
great
its
plain
and
simple
quality
ingredients
used
to
make
a
quality
beer
seek
this
out
and
buy
many
in
case
they
dont
make
it
again
o
fruity
and
sweet
cherry
and
apple
fruit
salad
this
was
a
great
choice
for
after
dinner
serendipity
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
large
red
head
alot
of
sweet
aromas
especially
cherry
the
taste
has
a
blend
of
sweet
fruits
cherry
is
profound
with
hints
of
the
apples
and
cranberries
great
full
flavor
all
the
fruits
blend
together
there
is
no
stages
of
flavors
from
the
fruits
not
overpowering
sweet
overall
a
fantastic
fruit
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
overall
but
i
have
had
a
number
of
them
and
serendipity
reminds
me
that
no
one
does
it
quite
like
new
glarus
very
enjoyable
i
hope
they
keep
this
year
round
even
when
they
bring
back
belgian
red
o
the
best
example
of
a
fruit
beer
that
i
know
of
i
really
dont
know
how
new
glarus
could
improve
on
this
bravo
overall
ill
keep
this
simple
this
beer
is
amazing
even
if
you
hate
beer
this
beer
is
for
you
perfect
for
a
postthanksgiving
treat
to
just
mellow
your
night
if
you
see
this
beer
buy
it
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
great
job
new
glarus
keep
up
the
fruit
beers
and
keep
them
your
secret
because
they
are
truly
a
work
of
art
but
its
not
an
exemplar
its
only
itself
and
itself
is
perfect
overall
a
truly
great
fruit
beer
the
fruit
flavor
is
big
and
bold
while
the
sweetness
is
balanced
and
the
body
is
smooth
well
balanced
and
really
tasty
o
just
a
wonderful
treat
you
can
bet
i
will
be
visiting
this
one
again
while
it
is
around
and
im
not
a
fruit
beer
fan
but
this
is
really
great
effervescent
bubbles
give
this
beer
life
crisp
and
bubbly
fits
this
beer
to
perfection
big
flavors
of
cherries
and
apples
the
cranberries
really
show
up
on
this
finish
as
this
tarts
up
quite
nicely
this
sets
itself
apart
from
the
other
fruity
mainstays
from
these
guys
its
sweet
no
doubt
some
would
say
too
sweet
but
the
tartness
comes
through
at
the
right
moment
giving
a
nice
kick
to
the
back
end
i
think
id
be
able
to
get
through
a
bottle
of
this
one
my
own
but
i
find
it
is
the
perfect
beer
to
share
sweet
tart
tasty
thank
you
dan
you
work
quite
the
magic
with
some
fruit
thanks
to
traci
for
sending
this
one
out
for
me
to
try
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
vibrant
red
color
with
a
fizzy
white
colored
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
or
retention
behind
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
smell
like
pure
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
in
there
to
give
it
more
of
a
natural
essence
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
like
fruit
punch
its
got
the
cherry
and
the
apple
and
the
cranberry
all
in
there
at
different
times
the
flavors
mix
well
but
really
give
off
a
juicelike
flavor
the
oak
is
a
little
on
the
hidden
side
i
feel
it
could
have
been
aged
a
bit
longer
to
possibly
give
this
one
more
of
that
wooden
flavor
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
highly
carbonated
it
was
sharp
tart
and
crisp
its
was
also
light
bodied
for
having
such
a
large
amount
of
flavor
overall
i
cant
complain
its
a
good
brew
much
like
the
raspberry
tart
and
the
belgian
red
from
new
glarus
this
one
just
adds
a
new
outlook
to
what
theyre
able
to
pull
off
when
nature
throws
them
a
curve
ball
this
beer
is
enjoyable
its
sweet
and
juicy
and
loaded
with
fruity
flavors
its
worth
trying
if
that
is
what
youre
into
verdict
another
smashing
success
from
new
glarus
when
it
comes
to
fruit
beer
they
have
a
knack
for
this
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
will
miss
belgian
red
for
the
time
being
but
this
is
a
stand
out
beer
and
hopefully
one
that
stays
in
production
after
belgian
red
returns
thanks
joshuaseresse
for
the
opportunity
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
would
have
no
problem
slamming
a
bottle
like
it
was
water
awesome
m
rounded
but
cloying
and
too
heavy
from
sweetness
o
overall
a
fantastic
new
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
belgian
red
but
it
is
on
par
with
raspberry
tart
in
my
opinion
having
now
had
a
lot
of
all
three
in
the
last
week
i
think
the
reviewer
who
said
this
seems
like
a
blend
of
belgian
red
cranbic
and
apple
ale
is
spot
on
tastes
like
70
belgian
red
20
cranbic
and
10
apple
ale
it
has
a
light
tartness
to
it
which
i
loved
though
it
wasnt
so
sour
that
my
girlfriend
who
doesnt
like
sours
couldnt
drink
it
in
fact
she
loved
it
world
class
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
their
fruit
beers
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
that
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
finest
that
new
glarus
has
ever
created
this
is
right
at
the
top
of
the
list
with
the
belgian
red
and
the
raspberry
tart
i
really
enjoyed
the
combination
of
sweet
red
fruit
oak
vanilla
and
the
slight
sour
character
the
most
in
serendipity
i
highly
recommend
and
suggest
going
out
and
getting
this
if
youre
a
fan
of
ng
fruit
ales
and
if
you
live
in
wisconsin
or
live
near
the
border
pours
a
clear
blackcherry
red
with
a
small
pink
head
smells
like
apples
cherries
and
cranberry
juice
in
that
order
of
strength
smells
sweet
taste
is
great
starts
like
a
sweet
cherry
pie
then
tart
sour
crisp
apples
and
cranberries
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
malty
finish
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
acidic
but
not
offputtingly
so
clean
and
refreshing
will
definitely
buy
another
bottle
or
two
before
this
beer
disappears
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
bright
clarity
and
a
frothy
head
that
left
a
halo
of
sticky
spotty
lacing
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
big
fruity
aroma
of
cherries
and
cranberries
possibly
apple
too
the
fruit
is
obviously
natural
with
a
light
tartness
to
it
flavors
of
cherry
are
most
noticeable
at
first
then
the
supporting
notes
of
the
apple
and
cranberry
blend
in
afterwards
also
in
the
mix
is
a
nicely
dry
wood
tannin
in
the
aftertaste
that
balances
the
sweet
tart
quality
of
the
fruit
forward
notes
it
leads
off
with
its
light
body
is
reminiscent
of
cranbic
a
little
bit
so
is
the
moderate
tartness
with
a
slight
sharpness
to
it
overall
its
very
drinkable
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
new
glarus
fruit
beers
though
its
not
far
off
from
the
existing
range
o
another
amazing
fruit
beer
from
ng
the
fruits
blend
perfectly
together
to
give
mouthwatering
flavors
and
a
very
nice
aroma
id
say
more
but
this
beer
really
speaks
for
itself
i
normally
prefer
raspberry
tart
to
the
belgian
red
as
belgian
red
borders
on
too
sweet
but
serendipity
takes
care
of
this
rumor
has
it
that
new
glarus
will
brew
this
again
if
it
is
popular
and
i
hope
that
is
true
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
3
fruit
beers
they
are
all
a
treat
but
this
is
the
one
of
the
three
i
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
due
to
the
others
being
quite
sweet
hope
this
becomes
a
permanent
addition
o
this
beer
works
well
both
at
fridge
temp
and
closer
to
cellar
temp
poured
cold
its
reminiscent
of
sparkling
wine
as
it
warms
it
gets
closer
to
mulled
cider
with
the
spices
becoming
more
pronounced
i
drank
the
whole
750
myself
over
a
period
of
two
hours
so
i
could
see
different
characteristics
of
the
beer
evolve
as
it
warmed
if
youre
going
to
share
it
serve
it
closer
to
cellar
temp
abv
isnt
listed
but
i
would
guess
that
it
isnt
very
high
maybe
4
5
or
5
5
all
three
fruits
involved
in
this
beer
are
immediately
recognizable
and
full
of
robust
flavor
i
was
hoping
for
slightly
more
sour
but
its
a
great
beer
nonetheless
just
not
necessarily
my
particular
style
of
choice
overall
this
is
another
absolute
standout
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
they
seem
to
have
a
gift
for
capturing
the
authentic
flavors
of
local
fruit
o
cranberries
seems
to
be
the
main
focus
of
this
beer
carbonation
help
stimulate
and
imitate
the
tartness
of
the
cranberries
glad
to
have
another
fruit
beer
mixed
into
the
usual
lineup
of
new
glarus
barrel
aged
beers
o
hands
down
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
tart
cherry
melds
perfectly
with
the
cranberry
the
apples
round
the
tart
flavor
out
and
make
it
thoroughly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
5
picked
up
a
few
of
these
during
my
transit
back
from
darkness
day
gotta
love
new
glaruss
attitude
failed
cherry
crop
no
problem
poured
into
a
new
glarus
flute
glass
appearance
is
a
deep
purple
red
that
is
strikingly
clear
it
appears
just
like
juicy
juice
minimal
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
amazing
first
thing
that
comes
through
is
cranberry
with
a
slight
tartness
the
apples
then
pick
up
and
provide
a
bit
of
rustic
character
and
then
comes
the
cherry
the
three
fruits
are
so
harmonious
which
makes
for
a
candied
fruit
aroma
that
suggests
a
bit
of
sweet
and
a
bit
of
tart
the
taste
is
incredible
it
starts
with
the
more
candied
side
of
the
fruits
again
with
a
nice
harmony
of
the
three
featured
fruits
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
nice
tartness
that
takes
over
the
palate
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
overall
new
glarus
has
struck
gold
yet
again
with
their
fruited
beer
this
is
perhaps
the
most
balanced
and
delicious
one
yet
if
you
havent
sought
this
one
out
do
it
now
lovely
excellent
this
spinoff
of
the
famed
wisconsin
belgian
red
is
an
apple
cranberry
and
cherry
concoction
from
new
glarus
the
beer
pores
a
nut
brown
with
red
highlights
and
sports
very
little
foam
the
cherries
pull
through
the
aroma
along
with
a
heavy
dose
apples
the
yeast
also
contributes
the
flavor
highlights
the
fruit
in
many
ways
it
reminds
me
of
carbonated
fruit
juice
with
an
emphasis
on
apples
and
a
twist
of
beery
goodness
the
cherries
nicely
compliment
the
apples
the
cranberries
contribute
tartness
the
palate
is
left
dry
this
beer
is
complex
with
unique
character
i
just
loved
this
beer
it
was
the
first
of
3
new
glarus
beers
i
traded
for
that
i
get
to
enjoy
and
already
it
was
the
most
intenselyflavored
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
had
such
intense
flavors
it
was
almost
like
drinking
fruit
juice
i
suppose
that
might
not
appeal
to
some
beer
drinkers
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
wish
new
glarus
beers
like
this
one
were
available
where
i
live
i
had
to
trade
for
this
one
thanks
abisonego
i
wouldnt
drink
them
all
the
time
but
i
would
definitely
crack
one
open
every
so
often
one
word
of
warning
though
do
not
buy
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
cranberries
be
warned
o
fantastic
right
up
there
with
the
other
ng
fruit
beers
overall
a
big
disappointment
for
me
it
is
still
an
interesting
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
sour
more
complex
version
of
belgian
red
this
ended
up
being
my
least
favorite
of
the
new
glarus
750ml
fruit
beers
maybe
ill
age
one
for
a
bit
and
see
if
the
tartness
comes
through
at
all
i
cant
think
of
a
tastier
fruit
beer
at
least
as
good
as
belgian
red
maybe
even
better
d
this
beer
screams
harvest
a
lot
of
similar
characteristics
of
belgian
red
but
fairly
different
at
the
same
time
new
glarus
can
work
magic
with
their
fruit
beers
overall
dan
carey
is
a
fruit
beer
genius
this
beer
proves
it
he
is
no
one
trick
pony
hiding
behind
his
world
famous
fruit
twins
and
shows
off
his
originality
creativity
and
diversity
with
this
beer
he
is
a
truely
amesome
brewer
who
is
not
afraid
to
step
out
of
his
comfort
zone
and
change
it
up
for
the
better
when
conditions
are
not
optimal
for
making
his
tried
and
true
belgian
red
he
took
all
the
strengths
of
the
fruit
beers
belgian
red
and
apple
ale
that
he
already
brews
adds
some
cranberries
and
poof
the
next
big
thing
to
come
from
this
amazing
small
town
wi
brewery
honestly
i
enjoyed
serendipity
better
than
both
raspberry
tart
and
belgian
red
senendipity
blows
both
them
both
away
raspberry
tart
is
now
dethroned
as
my
favorite
new
glarus
fruit
beer
lets
keep
in
mind
that
both
raspberry
tart
and
belgian
red
are
also
wonderful
fruit
beers
with
very
high
accolades
my
only
request
is
dan
please
brew
serendipity
all
year
long
yep
i
just
said
it
this
may
very
well
be
my
favorite
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
all
of
them
are
so
well
done
and
this
is
just
a
unique
twist
for
a
fruit
beer
and
it
works
wonderfully
o
overall
this
is
another
excellent
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
although
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
dan
carey
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
seek
out
i
prefer
it
to
both
the
belgian
red
and
the
raspberry
tart
both
of
them
are
also
great
beers
but
they
are
a
bit
one
dimensional
where
the
serendipity
is
a
bit
more
complex
i
hope
this
one
sticks
around
it
shouldnt
be
a
beer
that
temporarily
replaces
the
belgian
red
it
should
be
added
as
another
year
round
option
o
if
youve
experienced
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
youll
find
yourself
in
quite
a
familiar
realm
with
serendipity
but
this
beer
doesnt
only
piggy
back
on
their
successes
it
flourishes
with
new
and
delicious
fruit
experiences
serendipity
proves
once
again
dan
carey
is
an
expert
brewer
of
fruit
beer
buy
without
hesitation
and
be
rewarded
for
this
without
question
will
be
another
awardwinning
beer
from
new
glarus
overall
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
fruit
brew
from
new
glarus
its
slightly
tart
as
advertised
but
nowhere
near
belgian
red
or
raspberry
tart
levels
the
different
fruits
work
so
well
together
i
will
definitely
be
buying
much
more
of
this
brew
and
hope
that
it
works
its
way
into
a
somewhat
regular
rotation
in
years
to
come
wow
ive
had
all
of
the
new
glarus
beers
all
the
thumbprints
etc
and
this
is
a
really
special
beer
i
got
6
bombers
of
this
today
and
i
am
enjoying
my
first
glass
as
i
type
this
this
is
really
like
a
combination
of
belgian
red
raspberry
tart
and
enigma
thats
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
it
has
all
the
flavors
of
all
3
of
those
beers
all
blended
into
one
in
fact
i
emailed
the
brewery
to
tell
them
this
was
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
by
them
this
is
really
an
amazing
beer
wow
i
cant
recommend
this
more
highly
than
i
do
go
buy
this
now
world
class
beer
by
ng
happy
accident
indeed
new
glarus
took
the
poor
cherry
crop
in
2012
in
stride
and
came
up
with
a
new
delicious
brew
serendipity
pours
a
burnt
reddish
color
with
a
slightly
pink
head
the
scent
is
still
mostly
cherries
but
is
overall
very
fruity
and
sweet
smelling
giving
it
that
classic
sour
ale
smell
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
all
the
main
elements
cherry
cranberry
and
apple
evident
in
the
mix
added
to
the
mix
was
the
great
decision
to
age
this
in
oak
to
make
this
an
interesting
fruity
and
delicious
sour
ale
that
is
supposedly
only
to
be
around
until
jan
1
in
place
of
their
usual
belgian
red
get
it
while
you
can
folks
o
absolute
delight
may
replace
moon
man
as
my
favorite
brew
from
ng
wonderful
brew
and
must
have
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
easily
just
unreal
strawberry
goodness
the
fruit
is
all
there
you
must
like
strawberryrhubarb
to
enjoy
this
beer
though
i
love
natural
fruit
nonacidic
styles
and
this
takes
the
cake
i
usually
love
ng
fruit
beers
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
pours
a
murky
amber
red
with
a
frothy
head
smells
like
pungent
fresh
strawberries
and
berry
preserves
with
a
touch
of
rhubarb
tang
on
the
end
doesnt
smell
artificial
in
any
way
just
packed
with
freshh
berry
taste
pretty
much
follows
thebnose
here
again
hust
bursting
with
strawberry
preserves
although
i
wish
it
had
slightly
more
tartness
from
the
rhubarb
it
is
incredibly
well
balanced
moderate
carbonation
light
body
and
creamy
nrw
glarus
just
nails
fruit
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
o
a
very
good
fruit
beer
if
sweetness
is
your
thing
ng
is
one
of
the
better
makers
of
these
types
of
beer
overall
massively
drinkable
and
tasty
ive
never
had
a
strawberry
beer
that
was
this
successful
wonderful
stuff
beautiful
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
retains
well
smells
of
freshly
squeezed
strawberries
honey
sweet
cream
and
tart
fruits
tastes
of
sweet
strawberries
tart
fruit
comes
through
at
the
back
of
the
palate
and
it
balances
out
the
sweetness
well
pretty
rich
and
full
bodied
for
such
a
low
alcohol
brew
but
it
works
well
just
a
damn
good
beer
overall
sweetness
is
matched
by
the
tartness
of
the
rhubarb
and
the
light
alcohol
is
matched
by
a
full
creamy
body
with
a
crisp
finish
probably
my
favorite
beer
too
fruity
and
tasted
more
like
champagne
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
o
wow
another
fantastic
fruit
beer
by
new
glarus
i
dont
even
like
rhubarb
and
im
not
particularly
a
fan

the
combination
is

im

obviously
i

give

a

really
didnt

to

my

try
of
any

visually
not
super
appealing
with
the
murky

great
smell
on
this
fresh

and
red

taste
was
fine
i

been

if
it
had
some

going
on

o
another

from

follow
the
advice
on
the
bottle
and
drink
a
bit
colder
than
cellar
temp
imo
it
would
creep
closer
to
5s
if
the
rhubarb
its
acidity
were
closer
to
the
intensity
of
the
strawberry
though
still
fantastic
and
no
complaints
as
is
o
a
fruit
beer
that
is
true
to
its
description
its
pretty
sweet
and
best
shared
but
a
nice
switch
up
from
the
usually
mundane
world
of
fruit
beers
my
favorite
of
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
it
also
helps
that
i
love
the
tart
sweet
taste
of
rhubarb
yep
strawberry
rhubard
its
there
yum
just
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
still
another
awesome
new
glarus
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
words
to
say
besides
strawberry
but
that
describes
it
very
well
once
again
new
glarus
captures
a
fruit
flavor
better
than
anyone
else
very
good
and
authentic
but
a
little
more
cloying
and
not
as
drinkable
as
their
other
fruit
750s
a
small
pour
of
this
one
is
best
i
think
still
probably
the
best
only
straightup
nonsour
strawberry
ale
around
overall
another
killer
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
this
one
works
out
well
with
both
the
tartness
and
rhubarb
to
balance
out
the
super
sweet
strawberry
candy
like
flavors
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
it
falls
in
line
with
all
the
other
new
glarus
fruit
offerings
plenty
of
fruit
and
sticky
sugars
yet
somehow
balanced
and
not
too
over
the
top
i
could
never
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
half
glass
of
this
but
it
certainly
is
my
wifes
jam
and
she
can
rock
this
back
like
its
nothing
brownish
purple
in
color
fruity
sour
kind
of
soapy
smell
nice
sweet
taste
tartness
from
the
strawberries
but
still
sweet
this
is
good
but
the
cherry
one
us
better
id
like
this
a
lot
more
if
i
could
glean
something
other
than
strawberry
from
uncapping
to
finish
its
just
a
strawberry
sugar
bomb
thats
not
unpleasant
just
not
suited
for
750ml
quantities
pour
is
a
murky
copper
with
some

edges
and
a
tight

is

notes
strong
strawberry
fruit
rollup
comes

taste
is
more
clean
strawberry
jam
with
a
faint
earthiness
to
balance
really
soft
body
and
fairly
assertive
carbonation
with
a
semi
dry
finish
a
hint
if
tartness
in
back
as
the
bright
strawberry
jam
lingers
fairly
clear
medium
brown
with
a
gray
tinge
from
the
rhubarb
its
not
a
pretty
beer
strawberry
dominates
the
aroma
but
the
rhubarb
is
the
star
in
the
flavor
adding
a
tangy
tartness
fairly
good
balance
reminiscent
of
the
pie
definitely
a
dessert
beer
a
bit
of
a
guilty
pleasure
overall
great
freaking
beer
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
o
a
delicious
concoction
well
balanced
flavor
profile
id
definitely
drink
another
poured
into
a
wine
glass
a
murky
brown
with
little
to
no

this
kind
of
looks
gross
the
smell
is
amazing
though
the
smell
is
straight
up
strawberry
preserves
go
to
the
store
pick
up
a
jar
of
smuckers
strawberry
preserves
open
and
inhale
and
thats
what
this
beer
smells
like
taste
perfectly
mirrors
the
smell
not
getting
much
of
the
rhubarb
but
i
really
dont
care
the
only
complaint
i
guess
is
that
the
sweetness
starts
to
naw
at
you
after
about
4
ounces
its
like
getting
too
much
of
a
good
thing
in
small
doses
this
is
amazing

incredible
sour
that
taste
just
like
the
name
says
o
the
outpouring
of
strawberries
in
new
glarus
strawberry
rhubarb
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
strawberry
beer
actually
tasting
like
fresh
fruit
not
artificial
flavoring
which
is
stellar
when
it
comes
down
to
the
brass
tacks
though
strawberry
rhubarb
as
fantastic
as
it
is
still
doesnt
measure
up
to
new
glarus
other
awardwinning
fruit
beers
ill
still
opt
for
a
serendipity
this
is
a
strawberry
rhubarb
sweet
and
sour
beer
there
is
strong
carbonation
that
can
be
compared
to
sparkling
champagne
you
cant
see
through
the
amber
brown
color
it
smells
like
a
sweet
bruised
apple
this
is
a
good
beer
to
introduce
people
to
craft
beer
and
it
is
also
one
that
experienced
beer
connoisseurs
can
enjoy
o
other
than
the
look
of
the
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
was
worried
it
would
taste
like
reds
atrawberry
ale
but
you
can
definitely
tell
its
brewed
with
real
strawberries
and
it
has
a
natural

quite

a
great

beer
with
tartness
and
sweetness
in
balance
not
so
much
funk
not
a
sour
bomb
and
not
the
most
complex
beer
ever
but
really
quite
enjoyable
i
dont
know
how
they
pull
these
fruit
beers
off
but
new
glarus
is
quite
good
at
them
recommended
for
sure
just
dont

at
it

and

i
paired

awesome
pairing
cheers
cheers
o
overall
i
am
somewhat
new
to
this
style
but
the
naturalness
of
the
flavors
really
caught
me
by
surprise
this
was
refreshing
and
definitely
a
treat
will
be
looking
for
more
fruit
beers
from
ng
in
the
future
i
would
consider
this
more
of
a
dessert
beer
but
i
could
see
enjoying
this
on
any
hot
summer
night
whether
ive
had
dessert
or
not
new
glarus
does
such
an
excellent
job
with
their
fruit
beers
sticky
sweet
overripe
strawberry
nose
color
is
a
dirty
red
luscious
huge
berries
that
are
very
sweet
a
touch
of
rhubarb
tartness
this
is
definitely
on
the
sweeter
fruity
side
than
tart
and
astringent
this
is
pretty
straightforward
but
its
wonderfully
light
and
refreshing
perfect
summer
sipper
verdict
absolutely
delicious
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
and
in
my
mind
the
pinnacle
of
their
fruit
program
wonderful
tart
rhubarb
flavor
nice
complimenting
strawberry
flavor
just
the
amount
of
each
id
like
rhubarb
in
focus
my
favorite
fruit
yes
its
a
root
but
i
like
it
more
than
any
other
fruit
bottle
poured
a
light
murky
brownreddish
color
ale
with
a
sizeable
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
tart
rhubarb
notes
with
some
lightly
sweet
raspberry
notes
taste
is
a
lot
more
tart
than
i
had
expected
with
rhubarb
notes
being
more
dominant
than
the
strawberry
notes
taste
is
more
tart
than
the
sweeter
side
associated
with
some
of
the
new
glarus
beers
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
lot
but
this
is
definitely
more
complex
and
bit
less
drinkable
than
i
was
expecting
o
flat
out
a
glorious
beverage
regardless
of
alcohol
was
a
treat
to
try
will
clear
the
shelf
if
i
ever
see
it
anywhere
in
the
future
o
i
like
strawberry
so
this
was
a
win
for
me
would
have
loved
a
bit
more
balance
from
a
tart
rhubarb
character
but
im
nitpicking
really
awesome
stuff
o
had
this
beer
back
to
back
with
westbrooks
rhubarb
remix
i
love
new
glarus
and
this
beer
hit
me
just
like
their
others
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
o
wish
more
of
the
tart
rhubarb
was
present
and
less
of
the
cloyingly
sweet
strawberry
as
sweet
as
this
was
its
not
as
sweet
as
serendipity
good
but
not
great
ill
cellar
my
other
bottle
for
a
few
years
and
see
if
it
even
out
thanks
again
for
this
bottle
matt
it
is
another
wellmade
fruit
beer
from
this
brewery
it
tastes
like
the
fruits
that
it
is
brewed
with
nice
sweettart
character
overall
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
another
excellent
example
of
new
glarus
fruit
beers
pours
the
murkiest
light
grey
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
head
on
top
huge
aromas
of
juicy
sweet
strawberries
and
a
hint
of
earthy
and
tartness
hops
yeah
maybe
the
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
with
lots
of
sugary
sweet
strawberries
with
just
a
hint
of
earthy
tartness
to
not
make
it
cloying
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
just
short
of
syrupy
mouthfeel
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
cast
from
the
same
mold
as
the
other
beers
with
a
different
fruit
and
the
same
wonderful
results
poured
a
clearish
rustyred
color
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
nearly
completely
disappeared
some
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
blipping
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
wafts
of
strawberry
from
the
glass
before
i
even
held
it
to
my
nose
unlike
other
ng
fruit
beers
ive
had
this
one
came
off
really
strong
and
really
artificial
like
those
little
strawberry
hard
candies
the
taste
was
similar
very
sweet
loads
of
strawberry
with
any
rhubarb
tartness
being
incidental
andor
overwhelmed
by
the
candy
sweetness
of
the
strawberry
artificial
and
nearly
medicinal
yet
still
strangely
alluring
body
was
medium
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
and
cloying
i
didnt
hate
this
it
had
its
charm
but
it
was
just
way
to
onesided
sweet
faketasting
for
me
to
want
more
than
a
sample
at
a
time
i
love
all
of
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
and
this
one
is
awesome
too
its
sweet
but
its
supposed
to
be
more
strawberry
than
rhubarb
in
both
nose
and
taste
hazy
wit
beer
color
with
a
good
inch
of
white
head
a
little
tartness
but
a
lot
of
jammy
sweetness
from
the
berries
and
rhubarb
a
simple
wheat
malt
base
lets
the
fruit
shine
strong
in
this
i
love
the
aftertaste
the
most
where
the
tartness
of
the
rhubarb
comes
back
to
fight
the
sugar
a
very
cool
sensation
on
the
tongue
prickly
carbonation
and
a
lighter
medium
body
keeps
this
drinking
easy
but
its
not
a
bottle
i
want
to
tackle
alone
it
is
far
better
shared
very
authentic
use
of
fruit
something
of
a
special
occasion
beer
but
one
of
the
better
uses
of
strawberries
in
beer
out
there
all
of
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
are
killer
and
i
am
thankful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
special
one
as
well
i
had
hoped
for
more
prominent
rhubarb
but
it
still
works
very
well
with
a
low
dose
of
it
pours
an
unassuming
murky
reddish
brown
with
one
to
two
fingers
of
dense
and
fluffy
head
that
settles
nicely
back
into
itself
absolutely
amazing
nose
incredibly
intense
strawberry
character
that
borders
on
fresh
jam
ephemeral
berry
sweetness
and
light
tartness
with
a
touch
of
earthy
notes
very
light
berry
sweetness
in
the
flavor
with
a
bit
more
acidity
than
the
nose
lets
on
light
bodied
and
tart
with
a
dry
finish
reddish
orange
with
highlights
of
ruby
strawberry
rhubarb
leaves
a
thin
white
head
that
provides
plenty
of
sticky
lace
the
expectant
aromas
of
strawberry
and
rhubarb
are
joined
by
a
cascade
of
other
notes
like
brown
sugar
wild
yeast
funk
and
earthiness
overall
the
aromas
create
a
delectable
piefilling
like
wonderment
for
the
senses
the
strawberry
flavors
open
on
the
palate
and
are
quickly
met
with
less
pronounced
notes
of
rhubarb
tanginess
that
helps
to
cut
the
sweetness
of
the
strawberries
lurking
under
the
main
flavors
a
slight
aceticness
creates
hints
of
sourness
that
blend
wonderfully
with
the
overall
impression
of
homemade
pie
creamy
and
lightly
carbonated
this
medium
bodied
ale
proves
that
dan
and
deb
are
truly
the
king
and
queen
of
fruit
beer
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
the
looks
are
pretty
nasty
but
the
flavor
is
awesome
check
it
out
fo
sho
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
give
me
the
nice
tart
bite
and
general
funkiness
of
a
good
belgian
fruit
lambic
over
this
any
day
maybe
some
age
would
help
lessen
the
strawberry
taste
and
let
some
of
the
tart
shine
through
more
mf
delicate
light
bodied

for

holidays
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
some
red
hues
and
a
brownish
off
white
head
smell
is
big
time
fresh
strawberries
and
some
tart
rhubarb
flavor
follows
with
up

sweet
strawberry
followed
by
a
tinge
of
malts
and
a
tad
of
sour
rhubarb
to
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
makes
this
super
easy
to
put
down
the
gullet
i
was
worries
i
wouldnt
like
this
as
other
strawberry
drinks
have
not
been
up
my
alley
but
as
usual
new
glarus
hit
it
on
the
nose
with
another
fruit
beer
very
nicely
done
this
was
a
hit
all
around
o
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
serendipity
is
my
fave
of
the
series
this
is
by
far
the
sweetest
and
least
drinkable
almost
a
caricature
of
a
beer
where
the
rapberry
tart
belgian
red
and
apple
ale
are
obvious
leaders
in
their
class
they
strike
me
as
being
overly
fruit
if
ever
so
slightly
but
this
strawberry
rhubarb
may
be
the
best
fruit
beer
to
have
ever
grazed
my
palate
i
am
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
and
this
is
exceptional
and
should
be
other
fruit
beer
fans
holy
grail
o
actually
tastes
like
strawberry
earthy
dirty
and
not
overly
sweet
nice
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
a
bit
of
a
colalike
mouthfeel
overall
i
like
this
i
generally
prefer
fruit
beers
that
are
a
bit
more
tart
but
this
is
not
too
sweet
and
the
flavor
is
genuine
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
new
glarus
fruit
beers
are
perfect
new
glarus
makes
great
fruit
beers
everyone
knows
that
this
is
great
even
for
their
high
standards
ive
had
pies
with
less
flavor
its
a
new
glarus
fruit
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
all
of
it
and
send
it
to
me
m
lighter
side
of
medium
high
carb
overall
another
marvelous
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
i
dont
think
this
one
is
as
good
as
raspberry
tart
or
wisconsin
belgian
red
the
flavor
is
milder
than
those
other
two
beers
but
its
still
highly
enjoyable
o
another
homerun
by
new
glarus
i
dont
think
they
can
do
anything
wrong
with
fruit
and
this
beer
is
up
there
with
the
best
try
this
if
you
can
i
am
not
the
biggest
strawberryrhubarb
fan
but
this
is
an
astonishing
beer
i
think
they
have
done
the
best
of
the
rhubarb
beer
attempts
thanks
to
jdiddy
for
breaking
this
one
out
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
unpasteurized
cider
with
a
loose
creamcolored
head
that
dissipates
into
an
oily
slick
nose
is
reminiscent
of
strawberry
preserves
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
the
rhubarb
cuts
the
sweetness
and
keeps
the
flavor
profile
from
being
too
cloying
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
but
closer
to
light
with
a
light
even
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
overall
another
awesome
fruit
beer
from
ng
its
amazing
how
much
flavor
is
packed
into
such
a
low
abv
brew
this
is
another
soontobe
legendary
fruit
creation
from
the
masters
of
the
style
way
to
go
new
glarus
overall
very
nice
beer
that
would
be
made
better
if
i
could
get
to
like
the
ng
yeast
flavour
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
strawberry
pie
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
strawberry
and
rhubarb
pie
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
quite
sweet
but
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
im
not
sure
that
if
i
didnt
know
id
immediately
peg
this
as
beer
it
is
quite
good
though
and
unique
among
beers
ive
tried
overall
this
is
a
great
offering
from
new
glarus
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
and
the
amount
of
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
definitely
the
best
strawberry
beer
ive
ever
had
there
is
plenty
of
carb
in
this
bottle
really
makes
the
presentation
impressive
with
the
foamy
white
head
the
body
has
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
like
cooked
rhubarb
the
smell
is
tart
strawberry
really
inviting
the
taste
delivers
the
strawberry
flavor
like
no
other
beer
ive
had
the
beer
finishes
with
a
light
tartness
that
does
give
the
tang
of
rhubarb
this
is
like
a
clean
crisp
version
of
strawberry
rhubarb
pie
really
delicious
fruit
beer
and
easily
the
best
strawberry
flavor
ive
had
this
beer
is
perfect
for
me
would
absolutely
drink
again
and
well
worth
what
i
traded
to
get
it
makes
me
want
to
make
a
trip
to
wisconsin
what
can
i
say
ng
knows
their
fruit
beers
this
is
delicious
the
strawberry
notes
are
very
fresh
and
perfectly
balanced
a
overall
quite
nice
sweet
but
not
overly
and
good
tartness
nice
acid
level
ugly
ducking
with
a
great
beer
underneath
o
overall
this
beer
screams
rhubarb
and
strawberry
the
strawberry
is
so
intense
here
would
like
a
bit
more
rhubarb
tartness
though
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
some
red
hues
and
a
brownish
off
white
head
smell
is
big
time
fresh
strawberries
and
some
tart
rhubarb
flavor
follows
with
up
front
sweet
strawberry
followed
by
a
tinge
of
malts
and
a
tad
of
sour
rhubarb
to
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
makes
this
super
easy
to
put
down
the
gullet
i
was
worried
i
wouldnt
like
this
as
other
strawberry
drinks
have
not
been
up
my
alley
but
as
usual
new
glarus
hit
it
on
the
nose
with
another
fruit
beer
very
nicely
done
this
was
a
hit
all
around
my
goodness
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
i
would
have
loved
a
pink
looking
beer
but
seriously
when
a
beer
tastes
this
damn
good
who
gives
a
flying
fuck
this
is
pretty
in
line
with
the
rest
of
new
glarus
fruit
offerings
clean
simple
and
delicious
im
glad
to
have
gotten
to
try
this
and
i
hope
they
keep
this
in
the
regular
lineup
o
a
perfect
appertif
beer
great
in
small
quanties
share
this
with
2
or
3
other
people
o
yet
another
successful
fruit
beer
from
ng
easy
drinking
fun
and
fresh
not
overly
complex
but
the
beer
manages
to
taste
just
like
the
name
says
without
any
artificial
quality
to
it
in
the
least
thanks
to
atoneworks
pours
a
murky
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
ok
lacing
smells
like
a
slice
of
warm
strawberry
rhubarb
pie
its
safe
to
say
that
ive
never
smelled
a
beer
like
this
the
taste
is
tart
with
lots
of
strawberries
it
finishes
with
a
sour
aftertaste
that
lingers
very
refreshing
ive
never
sampled
a
flemish
red
but
this
is
how
i
imagine
it
would
taste
its
got
a
lot
of
flavor
for
such
a
light
body
crisp
carbonation
overall
an
extremely
well
crafted
fruit
if
rhubarb
is
considered
a
fruit
beer
that
makes
a
perfect
aperitif
or
accompaniment
to
a
salad
on
a
warm
summer
or
early
fall
evening
o
might
be
my
favorite
new
tart
from
new
glarus
brewing
strawberries
are
almost
always
a
gimmick
or
failure
but
in
this
beer
they
actually
work
havent
had
a
bad
fruittart
beer
from
new
glarus
yet
world
class
indeed
overall
delicious
but
it
lacks
the
juicy
perfection
of
the
other
new
glarus
fruit
beers
overall
a
fantastic
fruit
beer
i
cant
say
its
my
favorite
out
of
the
incredibly
broadlydefined
style
but
its
certainly
up
there
they
manage
to
make
the
fruit
the
focal
point
of
the
beer
without
creating
something
cloying
and
overlysweet
rather
than
making
it
mouthpuckeringly
sour
with
bacteria
theyve
tapped
into
the
natural
tartness
of
strawberry
and
rhubarb
to
excellent
results
overall
impressive
nose
maybe
the
best
of
any
beer
recommended
overall
a
great
fruit
beer
just
love
the
way
this
one
tickles
the
tastebuds
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
slight
haze
a
prominent
beige
head
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
aromas
of
jammy
strawberries
are
strongest
a
little
of
that
distinct
rhubarb
aroma
if
you
look
for
it
taste
is
fruity
for
sure
strawberry
fruity
a
bit
seedy
and
fresh
with
a
bit
of
astringent
sour
rhubarb
noted
too
light
bodied
with
medium
to
slightly
high
carbonation
a
bit
of
tartness
to
balance
the
upfront
sweetness
overall
a
refreshing
easy
to
drink
tasty
beer
yet
to
have
anything
but
a
super
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
good
dessert
beerstrawberry
rhubarb
tortelike
o
as
with
all
new
glarus
fruit
beers
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
as
it
borders
on
a
nice
fruity
juice
nice
balance
of
fruitiness
and
sweetness
extremely
fresh
and
juicy
would
enjoy
again
i
know
a
5er
when
i
smelltaste
one
honestly
i
cant
think
of
how
this
beer
could
be
much
better
id
like
to
see
it
funked
up
a
little
but
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
different
beer
entirely
phenomenal
ugly
beer
hopleaf
tulip
an
odd
looking
beer
dark
garnet
extremely
cloudy
new
glarus
are
the
undisputed
not
open
to
debate
champions
of
the
fruit
beer
style
and
its
really
exciting
to
see
the
line
of
750s
expand
in
the
past
year
or
so
strawberry
is
an
ingredient
i
have
rarely
seen
translate
well
in
a
beer
until
now
this
is
bursting
with
fruit
flavor
a
little
tartness
from
the
berry
and
a
little
sweetness
from
the
rhubarb
this
is
an
instantclassic
and
an
incredible
summer
beer
o
really
good
beer
fantastic
actually
like
i
said
earlier
it
tastes
a
lot
like
strawberry
yogurt
the
only
problem
i
have
with
new
glaruss
fruit
beers
and
most
of
their
regular
beers
is
that
they
abv
is
so
damn
low
if
i
wanted
a
soda
i
would
drink
a
pepsi
phenomenal
try
some
oone
of
the
best
fruit
beers
out
there
had
alongside
serendipity
and
raspberry
tart
not
as
good
as
serendipity
though
taste
is
great
sweet
and
tart
strawberries
are
upfront
wild
an
earthy
tart
vegetable
rhubarb
flavor
some
straw
like
malt
adds
some
complexity
in
the
finish
and
there
is
a
pleasant
residual
sweetness
and
tartness
this
is
another
good
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
but
it
seems
the
flavors
are
a
little
muddled
this
opinion
is
based
on
their
other
fruit
beers
which
are
near
perfect
for
that
style
so
with
that
said
strawberry
rhubarb
is
still
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
out
there
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
new
glarus
bunch
thanks
to
the
gentlemen
from
the
midwest
for
the
hookup
of
ng
goodness
the
rhubarb
comes
into
play
in
at
least
one
way
and
possibly
two
ways
rhubarb
is
tart
so
it
is
probably
contributing
to
the
beers
sour
profile
but
it
is
a
sour
ale
so
it
is
hard
to
tease
out
the
rhubarbs
contribution
however
it
lends
a
tannic
finish
to
the
beer
that
causes
the
insides
of
my
cheeks
and
tongue
to
pucker
a
bit
which
makes
me
want
to
have
another
sip
for
me
this
means
that
mouthfeel
is
integrated
into
the
beers
profile
in
a
positive
way
if
you
dont
mind
sweet
with
your
sour
and
i
don
youll
find
this
beer
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
the
beer
appears
mildly
hazy
and
a
grapefruit
pinkish
color
the
aroma
is
classic
new
glarus
sweet
and
fresh
fruit
abounds
teeming
with
strawberry
and
rhubarb
akin
to
a
homemade
pie
just
delicious
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
as
with
other
beers
of
this
ilk
i
prefer
to
enjoy
in
small
quantities
as
the
sweetness
can
become
cloying
overall
this
was
fantastic
another
winner
from
new
glarus
if
you
are
not
a
fruity
beer
person
stay
away
from
this
beer
but
for
everyone
else
this
is
wonderfull
nice
balance
between
the
sweetness
of
strawberry
and
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
from
the
rhubarb
i
would
buy
this
beer
all
the
time
if
i
could
but
unfourtently
i
live
in
north
central
minnesota
which
is
about
a
two
hour
drive
from
where
i
can
buy
new
glarus
but
if
you
are
ever
in
wisconson
defintly
pick
this
one
up
if
this
had
more
tartness
i
dont
know
if
i
couldnt
have
given
it
an
even
better
rating
dan
carey
is
just
a
master
of
fruit
beers
theyve
come
out
with
two
new
highproduction
ones
this
and
serendipity
in
the
last
year
or
so
and
both
have
been
amazing
really
delicious
and
really
impressive
o
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
flavors
really
played
off
of
each
other
with
near
perfection
i
know
im
in
the
minority
here
but
i
enjoyed
this
even
more
than
serendipity
o
well
i
am
not
trying
to
knock
this
beer
not
dans
best
fruit
beer
or
sour
i
dont
know
if
any
brett
was
used
tasted
like
it
overall
try
it
i
enjoy
serendipity
more
than
this
one
this
phrase
is
usually
a
curse
but
here
i
use
it
with
admiration
perfectly
balanced
i
dont
know
how
new
glarus
makes
these
magical
potions
without
veering
into
cloying
or
nauseating
but
i
hope
they
never
stop
excellent
gets
damn
near
to
elite
status
appearance
is
somewhat
cloudy
with
an
orangebrownish
color
minimal
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
starts
with
bright
and
fruity
strawberry
with
notes
of
tart
rhubarb
and
mild
oak
the
strawberry
is
very
nicely
represented
here
the
best
strawberry
aroma
i
have
encountered
in
a
beer
the
taste
is
full
on
ripe
strawberries
which
presents
a
very
fresh
juicy
flavor
this
is
wrapped
around
a
hint
of
rhubarb
and
finishes
very
clean
not
quite
the
tart
bite
that
ive
grown
accustomed
to
with
other
new
glarus
fruited
brews
but
the
clean
finish
is
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
another
amazing
new
glarus
fruit
beer
not
sure
how
the
careys
do
it
but
they
know
how
to
incorporate
fruit
into
beer
color
is
a
cloudy
brownish
red
until
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
when
a
light
cloudy
ruby
red
color
comes
through
aroma
light
strawberry
with
some
caramel
malt
and
light
acidic
character
from
the
sourness
taste
again
strawberry
but
not
as
strong
as
other
new
glarus
fruit
beers
medium
malt
sweetness
with
some
sourness
maybe
some
from
the
rhubarb
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
probably
from
aged
hops
my
favorite
new
glarus
fruit
beer
by
far
o
what
a
great
wild
ale
this
one
is
delicious
id
probably
rank
this
as
my
lowest
of
the
big
4
fruit
beers
but
its
still
a
nice
diversion
and
gets
big
points
for
creativity
o
dont
let
the
appearance
of
this
beer
mislead
you
its
damn
tasty
and
not
quite
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
so
good
d
amazing
the
strawberryrhubarb
flavor
and
aroma
in
this
beer
only
complaint
is
it
is
a
bit
snapple
like
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
this
beer
is
another
definite
winner
from
new
glarus
nobody
makes
fruit
beers
as
good
as
they
do
as
consistently
as
they
do
o
dan
carey
is
my
brewidol
he
never
cranks
out
a
disappointment
seek
this
one
out
especially
if
you
love
fruit
beerstrawberriesrhubarbpieng
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
snifter
and
appeared
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tint
there
was
not
much
of
a
head
on
this
beer
but
there
really
is
not
supposed
to
be
the
highlight
of
this
beer
seems
to
be
the
aroma
as
it
smells
much
like
homemade
strawberry
jam
if
i
could
not
see
it
i
might
not
know
it
was
beer
on
the
initial
taste
one
gets
an
incredible
amount
of
sweetness
like
strawberry
jam
i
am
told
that
the
tartness
in
the
background
is
the
rhubarb
to
be
honest
i
do
not
know
what
a
rhubarb
tastes
like
so
in
regard
to
the
rhubarb
i
am
just
going
by
the
word
of
others
the
sweetness
of
the
strawberry
fades
as
the
tastes
continues
from
sweetness
to
a
more
seedy
berry
taste
it
makes
me
curious
as
to
whether
the
aromas
impact
on
the
initial
was
exaggerated
the
sweetness
continues
into
the
aftertaste
and
is
allowed
to
linger
because
of
the
thickness
of
the
beer
the
fruit
dominates
the
taste
in
this
beer
i
would
not
say
it
is
better
than
belgian
red
of
serendipity
but
it
is
another
strong
effort
by
new
glarus
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
too
sweet
and
easily
drinkable
right
now
im
somewhere
on
the
fence
with
the
tartness
while
its
certainly
tart
im
just
not
sure
how
like
it
seemed
a
little
bit
abrasive
however
this
could
be
bias
due
to
my
cough
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
overall
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
great
strawberry
fruit
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
tartness
overall
i
put
this
up
as
an
equal
to
serendipity
which
is
above
raspberry
tart
and
below
belgian
red
which
is
still
king
in
my
book
new
glarus
produces
probably
the
best
nonsour
fruit
beers
in
the
country
so
this
follows
in
the
same
tradition
of
the
others
delicious
refreshing
brew
for
sure
recommend
trying
this
at
least
once
overall
of
course
i
had
high
expectations
from
this
brew
and
it
did
not
disappoint
like
i
said
above
this
beer
feels
a
little
off
balance
in
the
strawberry
to
rhubarb
ratio
the
fruit
accents
are
incredibly
bright
and
vibrant
like
no
other
fruit
beer
in
the
business
o
an
amazing
fruit
beer
surprising
me
as
someone
who
isnt
normally
a
fan
pours
a
nice
light
red
strawberry
red
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
amazing
like
fresh
pressed
strawbeery
jam
sweet
and
sugary
this
one
starts
of
with
a
nice
quick
tart
punch
from
the
rhubarb
fallowed
by
the
sweet
juicy
strawberries
the
flavors
compliment
eachother
amazingly
almost
like
drinking
a
strawberry
fruit
roll
up
has
a
slighly
filling
mouth
feel
def
one
to
share
with
your
lady
friend
overall
another
fruit
beer
homerun
from
new
glarus
this
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
head
there
is
a
very
strong
aroma
of
strawberries
the
taste
is
a
sweet
clash
of
strawberries
and
rhubarb
it
basically
reminded
me
of
a
strawberry
fruit
rollup
from
when
i
was
a
kid
only
in
a
beer
form
i
dont
see
this
having
quite
the
hype
as
belgian
red
raspberry
tart
or
serendipity
but
its
still
quite
good
another
amazing
fruit
beer
from
ng
has
some
tartness
and
rhubarb
vegetal
notes
as
well
as
a
nice
amount
of
strawberry
pretty
much
all
i
expected
but
perhaps
i
would
like
just
a
bit
more
tartness
not
disappointed
overall
it
was
enjoyable
but
not
as
tart
or
full
bodied
as
i
had
hopes
for
as
what
i
have
had
before
from
new
glarus
fruit
beers
o
outstanding
frothy
head
retention
last
entirety
of
beer
fruit
flavors
are
excellent
i
did
hope
the
rhubarb
brought
a
much
higher
sourness
while
its
only
mildly
tart
low
abv
makes
this
an
superb
choice
as
a
desert
beer
very
refreshing
if
your
lucky
to
get
your
hands
on
one
it
wont
be
a
let
down
overall
another
masterpiece
by
new
glarus
this
guys
are
doing
amazing
things
with
fruit
beer
serendipity
and
strawberry
rhubarb
within
less
than
a
year
apart
new
glarus
and
company
we
are
going
to
expect
even
more
fruit
beer
experiments
since
you
nailed
the
last
two
that
you
brewed
i
highly
anticipated
this
fruit
beer
from
dan
and
crew
i
gotta
day
that
i
am
not
dissapointed
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
new
glarus
750s
i
was
expecting
a
sugar
bomb
like
raspberry
tart
and
belgian
red
instead
i
get
a
well
balanced
and
slightly
tart
beer
that
tastes
like
strawberry
pie
wonderful
job
tart
and
creamy
big
strawberry
flavor
with
acidic
tartness
from
the
rhubarb
light
and
spritzy
lingering
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
on
par
with
the
other
fruit
beers
they
make
about
as
tart
as
serendipity
the
strawberry
taste
is
pretty
assertive
on
point
with
dan
and
crews
world
reknowned
fruit
beers
exceedingly
we
are
able
to
cross
off
the
list
of
fruits
that
havent
been
blessed
to
be
brewed
in
new
glarus
wi
dont
stop
now
o
another
outstanding
fruit
beer
creation
by
new
glarus
and
dan
carey
keep
them
coming
overall
i
like
the
fruit
character
that
steps
up
this
golden
ale
will
always
look
for
more
of
this
in
the
future
o
this
is
a
sipping
beer
its
a
touch
to
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
has
a
lot
of
interesting
elements
but
they
do
not
always
come
together
overall
a
solid
fruit
beer
but
not
quite
top
tier
the
fruitbelgian
yeast
clash
just
a
little
bit
too
much
it
could
be
nice
with
either
more
fruit
flavor
or
less
phenols
other
than
that
the
amount
of
alcohol
is
nice
but
takes
away
a
little
to
much
since
the
fruits
dont
fully
develop
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
blueberry
backberry
along
with
belgian
yeast
i
thought
the
fruit
flavors
were
done
real
well
i
just
wish
they
had
put
this
in
a
wit
this
was
a
2012
vintage
at
the
brewpub
i
was
curious
to
try
this
combination
of
black
raspberries
and
blueberries
but
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
too
sweet
and
although
i
have
had
far
worse
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
have
again
is
this
a
beer
it
definitely
is
a
treat
for
beer
drinkers
medium
sweetness
the
fruit
comes
through
like
a
red
wine
like
nothing
ive
ever
drank
before
id
recommend
it
for
a
change
of
pace
or
nice
splurge
buy
one
afternoon
very
fruity
almost
cider
esque
strong
but
not
my
favorite
wont
reach
for
it
again
for
a
while
with
all
the
other
great
dogfish
options
felt
great
looked
great
smelled
great
tasted
great
o
not
a
bad
brew
from
dogfish
if
it
wasnt
for
the
rasberry
and
blueberry
puree
i
probably
wouldnt
like
this
beer
because
it
taste
a
lot
like
white
wine
and
i
am
not
a
fan
of
white
wine
very
sweet
and
fizzy
gotta
love
it
when
your
local
bars
get
some
cool
kegs
this
case
in
point
pours
a
partly
hazy
sunset
rusted
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
bone
foam
the
nose
comprises
blackberries
light
blueberries
very
light
banana
mild
biscuit
light
sourdough
and
a
pinch
of
allspice
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
berries
matched
by
some
belgian
yeastinfused
bread
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
and
light
grass
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
one
that
i
could
see
going
well
with
plenty
of
foods
muffins
and
lamb
dishes
spring
to
mind
i
think
i
got
hyped
up
for
this
beer
thinking
it
would
be
something
really
great
i
love
blueberry
beers
and
i
love
dogfish
so
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
combo
so
when
i
opened
the
bottle
i
didnt
think
the
smell
was
great
but
they
dont
all
smell
great
so
that
was
whatever
the
pour
was
good
and
the
appearance
was
a
good
hardy
beer
when
it
came
to
tasting
i
think
it
was
just
something
that
i
didnt
expect
so
i
didnt
love
it
wasnt
bad
but
im
not
sure
if
ill
buy
again
soon
mouthfeel
was
actually
nice
overall
i
gave
it
a
3
because
it
just
wasnt
for
me
080713
on
tap
just
a
taste
not
quite
the
fruitiness
id
hoped
for
all
in
all
a
good
tasting
brew
but
i
was
expecting
to
be
gob
smacked
and
that
didnt
happen
i
guess
thats
what
i
get
for
hyping
myself
up
this
is
one
those
that
may
just
fare
better
from
a
bottle
worth
a
second
chance
d
a
nice
one
to
try
as
very
different
but
i
dont
know
if
i
will
get
much
past
the
first
few
sips
yeasty
flavors
upfront
phenolic
and
footy
hints
of
fruit
come
through
would
like
a
bit
more
tough
to
discern
berries
seems
mostly
blueberry
emerging
spicy
bite
in
the
finish
yeast
dominates
too
much
for
me
which
detracts
from
the
exberryence
found
in
a
discount
bin
of
bombers
at
local
store
and
was
delighted
to
find
this
nice
fruit
beer
pours
a
beautiful
reddishpeachy
color
with
thin
pinkish
head
the
blackberries
come
in
heavy
on
smell
with
tinges
of
that
sourish
belgian
yeast
nice
strong
flavor
of
the
golden
ale
base
plays
under
those
real
berries
and
extra
notes
of
dates
licorice
granny
smith
apple
on
the
back
as
other
reviews
note
all
the
layers
mask
some
of
the
booziness
nicely
notes
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
start
off
your
tasting
with
if
you
sit
back
and
concentrate
you
can
find
many
layers
here
overall
this
was
good
not
great
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
it
was
an
intersting
change
of
pace
maybe
some
age
would
help
as
other
reviews
seem
to
suggest
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
if
youre
looking
for
a
big
fruit
beer
with
natural
flavors
and
some
winelike
qualities
this
should
be
right
up
your
alley
overall
more
like
wine
than
beer
at
this
stage
this
is
aging
really
well
and
im
willing
to
bet
i
wouldnt
like
this
beer
freshly
bottled
nearly
as
much
as
i
do
now
im
sure
it
would
be
a
solid
beer
but
i
can
see
it
being
super
sweet
jammy
and
heavy
on
the
fresh
fruits
used
this
is
becoming
darker
in
color
and
richer
in
malts
sugars
and
fruits
very
very
tasty
and
complex
fruity
fruity
fruity
not
that
you
should
have
expected
anything
less
from
a
beer
proclaiming
to
be
made
from
blackberries
and
blueberries
pours
an
interesting
redish
amber
with
a
clingy
thin
white
head
smell
is
a
lot
of
fermented
funk
sour
citrus
mild
malt
and
hints
of
blueberry
taste
is
yeast
but
opposite
of
the
smell
i
get
mostly
blackberry
on
the
palate
mildly
sweet
a
touch
of
sour
leaves
you
with
some
fresh
fruit
on
the
aftertaste
feel
is
great
easy
almost
too
easy
to
drink
you
would
swear
this
is
more
like
4
or
5
certainly
not
10
nice
boozey
warmth
once
it
gets
down
in
the
gullet
the
alcohol
can
sneak
up
because
its
so
easy
to
drink
i
downed
a
bomber
inside
of
30
minutes
and
definitely
felt
it
shortly
after
good
beer
preferred
red
white
if
they
can
really
be
compared
this
is
more
like
fruit
juice
with
beer
in
it
than
beer
with
fruit
in
it
still
thats
probably
what
was
intended
so
its
hard
to
knock
a
beer
for
being
what
it
is
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
in
no
hurry
to
have
it
again
unfairly
underappreciated
this
is
a
great
beer
well
made
and
fun
it
looks
pinkish
and
foamy
with
a
nice
richness
and
good
bubbling
smells
like
a
belgian
blond
but
has
some
great
germal
elements
malty
with
a
fruity
element
the
blueberries
stronger
than
the
black
berries
in
smell
and
taste
almost
tart
the
malt
meshes
amazingly
well
with
the
berries
a
cool
combo
and
definitely
something
different
yeasty
but
the
carbonation
is
huge
and
so
is
the
body
better
and
better
as
it
warms
up
love
the
fruit
here
like
no
other
and
the
alcohol
content
is
entirely
invisible
how
in
gods
name
is
this
thing
over
10
abv
just
feels
like
a
session
beer
overall
a
great
mix
of
fruit
flavor
and
taste
nose
of
baby
feet
a
little
but
a
real
high
quality
brew
here
this
is
a
2012
bottle
so
its
last
years
batch
i
have
to
say
theres
not
much
of
a
difference
in
the
year
this
has
been
cellared
overallnot
bad
definitely
need
the
subtlety
that
this
beer
provides
to
be
able
to
drink
the
fruit
stuff
the
dogfish
people
dont
typically
let
me
down
though
if
you
like
fruit
beers
then
you
will
love
this
its
one
of
the
most
natural
tasting
fruit
beers
ive
had
no
corn
syrup
sweetness
here
personally
i
enjoy
the
occasional
sweet
fruit
beer
so
i
enjoy
this
one
however
if
you
dont
like
those
types
of
beers
there
is
obviously
no
reason
for
you
to
waste
your
time
here
my
friend
brought
me
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
and
i
wish
id
have
known
to
age
it
seems
like
the
only
positive
reviews
come
from
vintage
bottles
mine
was
certainly
not
a
vintage
assuming
the
fruit
mellows
out
i
can
imagine
this
being
a
nice
beer
i
strongly
suggest
letting
it
sit
if
you
want
a
more
enjoyable
experience
watch
out
though
for
the
abv
a
very
welldisguised
10
o
i
am
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
ales
but
this
was
pretty
good
even
better
if
you
like
berries
the
flavors
were
not
at
all
overpowering
nice
to
sip

well

with
only
a

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
imperial

beer
nice
complexity
of
fruit
flavors
and
balance
of
spicy

esters
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
a
10
brew
a
very
enjoyable
offering
im
really
impressed
with
what
this
is
this
one
blows
away
barriers
as
to
what
to
expect
of
craft
beer
i
know
this
has
been
out
there
for
some
time
and
im
pretty
sure
ive
tried
it
before
as
ive
had
most
dfh
offerings
being
in
philly
not
sure
if
the
age
has
anything
to
do
with
it
but
i
really
am
enjoying
this
wow
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
one
big
ass
fruit
beer
and
its
a
good
one
dangerously
drinkable
and
not
as
sweet
as
you
would
expect
a
10
dfh
fruit
beer
to
be
im
looking
forward
to
trying
a
bottle
of
the
2013
batch
when
its
released
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
berry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
poured
this
fruit
beer
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
blueishpurplish
color
produced
a
thick
white
head
retention
was
average
and
lacing
was
minimal
the
aroma
of
this
ale
consisted
of
malted
barley
and
sour
fruit
juice
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
10
abv
thankfully
i
had
the
st
charles
whisker
biscuit
to
assist
me
with
this
a
sweet
malted
grainy
cereal
base
that
gives
way
to
tart
fruits
blueberry
and
black
raspberry
it
is
actually
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
tart
the
issue
i
have
with
many
fruit
beers
is
that
they
are
all
sweet
from
start
to
finish
this
ale
does
a
great
job
to
balancing
the
sweetness
from
the
malted
grain
with
the
tartness
of
the
berries
another
note
here
is
how
easy
to
drink
this
is
this
is
a
big
beer
but
very
easy
to
drink
dont
be
ashamed
to
grab
this
fruit
beer
and
share
this
with
a
friend
i
am
not
a
fan
of
fruit
flavored
beer
except
for
hints
of
the
flavors
and
this
beer
is
like
a
fruit
flavored
wall
of
marshall
amps
cranked
up
to
11
dogfish
head
makes
some
wonderful
beers
theyre
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
but
this
is
aggressive
and
obnoxious
the
smell
is
nice
mixed
berries
i
especially
smell
raspberry
but
the
taste
is
borderline
unbearable
tastes
almost
closer
to
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
its
so
sweet
and
fruity
so
unpleasant
i
poured
about
7
worth
of
its
13
dollar
bottle
down
the
drain
this
is
the
first
time
trying
this
beer
this
is
a
good
thing
because
i
likely
would
have
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
it
over
the
past
several
years
o
pretty
decent
fruit
forward
beer
that
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
it
still
was
worth
trying
though
drinkability
i
like
the
berry
flavor
but
the
slight
bitterness
takes
away
somewhat
from
overall
drinkability
o
i
like
it
its
good
maybe
not
great
but
very
good
recommended
i
may
not
have
it
again
but
im
glad
i
had
this
one
i
do
like
dogfish
head
very
much

overall
this
is
too
boozy
to
be
enjoyed
over
long
periods
of
time
with
a
abv
turned
down
a
few
notches
this
would
be
a
very
solid
beer
but
the
smell
and
flavor
profiles
tend
to
take
over
color
is
slightly
purple
from
golden
to
be
expected
good
lacing
on
the
glass
but
head
disappated
quickly
smell
is
more
blackberry
heavy
than
blueberry
taste
is
consistent
with
the
smell
slightly
boozy
taste
but
the
abv
tips
that
off
great
for
a
nightcap
o
dogfish
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
didnt
find
the
alcohol
presence
but
im
sure
an
entire
bomber
would
do
me
in
great
berry
flavors
with
a
small
supporting
cast
in
the
background
o
if
the
goal
was
for
a
berrybased
sparkling
ciderlike
beer
they
nailed
it
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
traditional
beer
but
is
good
for
what
it
is
edit
i
feel
like
i
didnt
do
this
beer
justice
in
the
review
or
the
score
so
i
adjusted
the
score
accordingly
like
many
people
on
b
a
im
not
the
biggest
veggiefruit
beer
fan
and
sometimes
my
reviews
will
reflect
that
bias
sidenote
dudes
please
stop
saying
that
fruit
beers
are
girly
im
a
woman
and
it
makes
me
feel
really
unwelcome
in
the
craft
beer
enthusiast
community
when
gender
is
used
as
a
benchmark
for
how
good
or
bad
beer
is
this
beer
accomplished
exactly
what
it
is
meant
for
its
a
good
seasonal
beer
and
you
can
tell
they
used
real
berries
instead
of
fake
flavoring
would
i
rather
have
a
robust
porter
or
an
ipa
sure
but
if
i
were
looking
for
a
fruit
beer
with
some
actual
complexity
this
is
a
really
excellent
one
i
like
a
good
fruit
beer
and
this
one
fits
the
bell
for
me
more
wine
tasting
than
beer
tasting
but
a
good
sipper
o
if
this
was
about
5
less
abv
and
was
crisp
and
dry
i
would
drink
this
beer
regularly
as
it
is
now
this
is
a
big
boozy
fruit
influenced
golden
ale
that
is
worth
checking
out
but
not
my
favorite
drinking
beer
beer
is
thick
and
sweet
strong
with
a
lot
of
cherry
flavors
very
strong
very
in
my
face
it
is
a
little
harsh
but
finishes
fine
lingering
fruitiness
very
sweet
nice
bold
fruit
beer
not
sugary
not
too
dry
or
sour
gets
the
flavor
well
this
beer
pours
an
amberruby
red
with
a
white
head
that
carries
a
hint
of
purple
within
it
and
is
very
thick
and
frothing
with
happy
bubbles
which
dissipates
slowly
leaving
a
nice
halffinger
head
and
also
light
and
sliding
lacing
that
droops
in
lovely
cloud
patterns
down
the
glass
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
yeasty
with
nice
hints
of
the
malts
and
stronger
hints
of
sweet
berries
i
also
detect
a
slight
hint
of
wet
dog
which
is
a
little
upsetting
to
the
beer
that
may
just
be
the
sour
berries
doing
funky
things
with
the
wet
smell
of
the
beer
but
it
is
a
little
strange
to
smell
malts
seem
sweet
and
light
and
a
hop
character
is
not
even
there
as
the
berry
bite
takes
its
place
the
beer
tastes
very
sour
with
a
metalliccitrus
tinge
in
the
back
of
the
taste
which
comes
partially
from
the
booziness
of
the
beer
but
that
doesnt
entirely
explain
the
metal
the
beer
is
almost
winelike
with
light
berry
accentuations
which
means
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
not
a
chugger
my
initial
thought
is
that
i
should
have
had
this
in
a
wine
glass
and
not
in
the
pint
mug
i
used
there
is
also
some
syrupy
flavor
after
the
taste
has
washed
over
your
mouth
and
the
bitter
of
the
raspberry
definitely
lingers
in
the
mouth
it
is
very
harsh
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
with
carbonation
it
leaves
the
mouth
very
dry
and
desertlike
the
farther
it
goes
on
the
tongue
but
the
very
middle
and
tip
seems
to
be
cloying
with
a
thick
and
sticky
syrup
feel
it
also
leaves
more
of
a
wines
sweet
fruity
lingering
in
the
mouth
than
a
beers
crispness
overall
i
am
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
especially
for
its
13
price
tag
it
has
a
nice
sour
taste
but
there
are
also
some
stranger
things
in
the
taste
especially
the
metalliccitrus
anomaly
the
fruit
just
doesnt
do
nicely
with
this
beer
i
either
want
more
fruit
flavor
or
less
and
more
beer
but
where
they
stand
is
not
really
working
for
me
i
also
dont
get
much
of
the
blueberry
in
the
taste
which
is
disappointing
i
suppose
the
raspberry
is
just
too
strong
of
a
flavor
but
i
would
have
loved
to
have
sensed
some
of
the
blueberry
the
beer
is
a
meh
and
definitely
not
a
recommended
from
me
honestly
i
just
want
more
berry
flavor
from
this
and
it
just
doesnt
deliver
sorry
dh
this
one
was
a
mistake
o
a
very
nice
beer
not
sure
they
hit
it
out
of
the
park
especially
for
the
cost
but
one
you
should
try
o
comes
off
like
a
tamed
version
of
fort
lots
of
berry
flavors
somewhat
of
an
earthy
and
medicinal
finish
way
too
much
alcohol
like
most
big
dfh
beers
i
think
this
is
meant
to
be
aged
to
calm
down
a
bit
i
hate
to
make
this
comparison
as
i
love
dfh
but
berry
flavored
malternative
beverage
the
best
fruit
beer
i
have
had
so
far
full
body
great
flavors
and
has
lots
of
kick
to
it
never
been
the
biggest
fans
of
these
type
of
brews
but
this
one
is
great
great
fruit
brew
here
another
stud
from
dfh
o
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
for
my
palate
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
this
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
an
easy
drinker
or
a
sessionable
beer
overall
a
little
too
sweet
still
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
revisit
i
dont
like
this
anymore
very
much
found
the
bottle
to
be
too
sweet
and
boozy
and
a
chore
to
drink
not
awful
but
just
not
very
appealing
these
qualities
would
work
better
in
a
big
stout
but
this
one
just
gets
too
hot
and
syrupy
after
a
few
sips
o
pretty
good
lets
the
fruit
shine
and
packs
a
nice
punch
the
last
time
i
had
it
it
must
have
been
older
because
it
seemed
to
have
the
flavors
blend
a
little
better
d
very
drinkable
very
fruit
forward
but
the
overall
beer
is
really
nice
and
interesting
i
like
the
balance
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
rich
auburn
color
body
with
just
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
nice
berry
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
a
little
tart
to
start
then
the
berries
come
in
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
gives
it
a
nice
like
sweet
flavor
i
get
like
a
white
wine
finish
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
nice
mouth
feel
very
little
after
taste
overall
this
is
very
different
and
i
really
like
this
beer
2012
bottling
pours
a
clear
pinkish
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
takes
some
time
to
go
down
scent
is
very
berryforward
quite
inviting
actually
smells
like
fresh
raspberries
and
blackberries
with
a
hint
of
tartness
lovely
aroma
taste
is
initially
just
a
bit
tart
but
quickly
turns
to
alcohol
flavor
there
is
some
definite
booziness
to
this
nowhere
near
fort
but
noticeable
booziness
belgian
yeast
flavors
with
some
spice
and
dark
malt
you
still
get
some
pleasant
raspberry
and
blackberry
not
really
picking
up
the
blueberry
finish
is
warming
and
sweet
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
although
it
drinks
fairly
light
the
puree
and
booziness
makes
it
feel
much
more
heavy
drinkability
is
fair
overall
i
was
very
skeptical
going
into
this
because
i
tried
fort
not
to
long
ago
and
hated
it
this
one
could
definitely
use
without
the
intense
alcohol
flavor
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
the
nose
especially
overall
not
really
what
i
am
looking
for
when
i
am
looking
for
a
beer
it
is
a
good
wine
alternative
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
sorta
a
white
winebeer
hybrid
o
if
you
like
the
occasional
belgian
fruit
beer
this
is
worth
a
try
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
it
was
good
original
review
10052010
overall
a
really
nice
unique
but
slightly
sweet
fruit
beer
i
was
expecting
something
insane
from
dogfish
head
based
on
the
other
reviews
but
you
pretty
much
get
what
you
read
on
the
label
which
is
really
nice
might
be
more
of
a
desert
beer
than
anything
you
would
want
to
drink
with
a
meal
othe
beer
borderlines
on
artificial
at
times
there
isnt
much
need
for
10abv
gorgeous
bright
red
with
a

subtle

of

feel
bright
berry
some

like
burn
on
be

sweet

remind
you
its
a
belgian
pale
ale
peppery
spiciness
flavors
all
blend
together
really
nice
tart
finish
pretty
subtle
for
such
a
big
berry
beer
nice
nothing
spectacular
though
not
worth
the
price
tag
a
big
booboo
for
dogfish
head
brewing
a
beer
thats
completely
unnecessary
10
witbiers
are
not
for
me
kudos
if
you
can
finish
a
whole
750ml
of
this
stuff
2
5
overall
definately
a
great
beer
and
unlike
many
dogfish
specialties
i
will
definately
consider
buying
it
again
at
first
i
was
significantly
unimpressed
by
this
black
and
blue
from
dogfish
after
a
few
sips
in
im
coming
around
a
bit
its
pretty
drinkable
relatively
light
in
body
and
probably
pretty
massappealing
im
still
not
in
love
with
the
black
and
blue
but
it
is
growing
on
my
slowly
this
is
definitely
not
the
best
fruit
beer
that
ive
ever
had
but
the
fact
that
it
is
a
fruit
beer
and
it
is
good
is
something
remarkable
its
fruity
and
juicy
but
not
overly
sweet
overall
one
of
the
better
fruit
experiments
from
dogfish
head
the
yeast
messes
with
the
profile
of
the
fruit
nice
fleshy
fruit
decent
o
i
like
this
beer
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
people
that
like
blueberry
beer
since
this
has
actually
blueberries
and
blackberries
in
it
love
the
smell
of
it
and
how
the
flavors
meld
together
this
ages
very
well
extremely
happy
with
it
after
keeping
it
in
my
basement
for
a
year
overall
i
have
had
a
couple
of
blueberry
beers
before
this
one
is
definitely
at
the
the
top
of
the
food
chain
not
super
sweet
but
just
right
you
will
definitely
like
this
beer
on
a
warm
summer
night
and
appreciate
its
purpose
hope
you
all
enjoy
and
cheers
nice
berry
aroma
could
even
smell
it
when
it
was
being
poured
10
abv
but
you
really
dont
get
the
alcohol
taste
or
burn
seems
like
it
could
be
a
sessionable
beer
but
the
abv
might
creep
up
on
you
strong
yeasty
flavor
from
belgian
yeast
on
back
end
overall
another
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
would
try
it
again
next
year
o
a
good
beer
but
definitely
one
to
share
very
sweet
o
decent
fruit
beer
not
quite
up
to
new
glarus
standards
but
glad
i
got
to
split
this
bottle
with
a
friend
nothing
stands
out
too
much
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
late
in
the
season
to
be
having
a
fruit
beer
but
i
found
a
2010
bottle
at
a
local
beer
store
and
had
to
have
it
it
tastes
just
like
it
smells
which
is
great
since
it
smells
wonderful
of
course
i
am
having
it
in
from
the
750ml
bottle
in
a
snifter
to
be
10
it
sure
is
hidden
well
but
most
of
that
probably
comes
from
age
if
you
like
fruit
beers
this
has
to
be
a
target
of
yours
it
is
a
wonderful
treat
this
looks
about
standard
for
a
big
fruit
beer
a
golden
red
color
with
a
tiny
head
aroma
is
about
what
id
expect
from
a
10
alcohol
brew
brewed
with
tons
of
blueberries
and
blackberries
taste
berries
and
booze
with
a
bit
of
malt
what
else
would
you
expect
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
with
prickly
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
a
great
extreme
fruit
beer
theres
a
ton
of
fruit
in
this
high
alcohol
beer
this
beer
poured
poured
out
as
a
purplish
red
color
with
a
foamy
pinkwhite
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
fruity
yeasty
and
has
a
little
funk
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
lot
like
wine
in
my
opinion
i
think
the
berries
used
in
it
give
off
an
interesting
flavor
once
fermented
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
semithick
like
most
of
the
dfh
big
bottles
are
overall
this
beer
is
decent
i
cant
say
that
ive
wanted
or
needed
to
have
it
since
the
first
and
only
time
i
drank
it
if
i
was
at
a
party
and
someone
had
it
i
would
totally
drink
it
again
overall
this
beer
is
too
boozy
not
flavorful
enough
and
in
need
of
more
carbonation
lots
could
be
improved
on
but
if
this
were
my
homebrew
i
would
be
eager
to
play
with
it
i
certainly
wouldnt
stop
here
id
reconfigure
the
recipe
and
try
to
make
something
spectacular
i
do
harbor
a
slight
concern
that
the
base
beer
is
the
wrong
platform
off
of
which
to
build
this
recipe
but
perhaps
more
fruit
and
a
bit
more
sweet
malt
action
could
save
it
overall
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
drink
im
not
usually
very
big
on
sweeter
beers
like
this
but
this
had
just
enough
balance
to
not
be
cloying
even
after
a
whole
bottle
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
an
excellent
dessert
beer
shared
after
a
nice
family
dinner
where
everybody
could
sip
on
it
it
is
pretty
delicious
md
medium
to
full
bodied
very
chewy
with
a
creamy
finish
difficult
to
drink
more
than
a
small
glass
too
sweet
and
thick
very
weird
for
the
style
at
10
this
beer
is
scary
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
ever
had
ill
definitely
pay
the
price
tag
for
this
again
overall
a
really
nice
unique
fruit
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
light
bodied
mead
i
was
expecting
something
insane
from
dfh
but
you
pretty
much
get
what
you
read
on
the
label
which
is
nice
just
unexpected
from
my
point
of
view
being
a
fan
of
dogfish
and
their
try
anything
attitude
i
wouldnt
advise
against
trying
it
just
not
my
cup
of
beer
138th
feel
is
a
strong
medium
and
the
carb
is
a
bit
lighter
than
the
red
and
white
counterpart
i
was
burping
up
jolly
ranchers
long
after
i
finished
this
so
the
artificial
flavor
stays
a
bit
a
bit
of
alcohol
to
but
not
hot
i
did
not
enjoy
this
so
much
to
fake
tasting
and
everytime
i
taste
candy
in
my
beer
its
a
huge
turn
off
had
3
bottles
of
this
along
with
3
bottles
of
red
white
on
a
fishing
trip
to
the
finger
lakes
must
say
i
liked
the
red
white
better
at
any
rate
this
is
a
fine
fruit
beer
the
fruit
is
very
pronounced
in
both
nose
and
mouthfeel
very
sweet
in
my
opinion
this
would
be
a
fine
after
dinnerdessert
beer
the
10
is
hardly
noticeable
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
quickly
not
so
sure
ill
revisit
this
in
the
future
but
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
very
nice
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
to
perfectly
balanced
out
the
fruit
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
buy
this
again
o
a
really
nice
fruit
forward
brew
love
the
berrycarbonation
pop
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
and
do
id
say
its
very
good
for
the
style
it
represents
pair
this
with
a
fresh

blue
is
a
clear
solid
golden
ale
topped
with
a
dense
sand
colored
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
super
fruity
aroma
of
fresh
black
raspberries
and
blueberries
its
a
little
sweet
a
little
floral
and
theres
a
whiff
of
light
grain
its
medium
bodied
and
lively
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
and
a
little
astringent
its
a
little
sweet
and
fairly
bitter
theres
a
little
sourness
it
tastes
more
like
fruit
wine
than
fresh
fruit
the
black
raspberry
is
pretty
prominent
at
the
start
of
the
taste
it
gets
progressively
more
bitter
as
the
finish
approaches
its
mostly
juniper
and
alcohol
by
the
finish
berries
linger
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
qualities
of
an
old
ale
a
mead
a
melomel
and
a
sahti
its
very
unique
it
tastes
a
little
boozy
so
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
for
chugging
but
its
enjoyable
unique
and
pretty
classy
o
i
can
dig
this
brew
its
kinda
like
a
blueberry
barleywine
not
sure
if
a
few
more
years
would
have
made
it
all
mellow
out
but
if
that
abv
can
tone
down
a
bit
this
would
be
a
really
nice
beer
d
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
great
beer
but
for
what
they
are
trying
to
do
here
they
really
nailed
it
this
is
a
fruit
beer
and
everything
about
it
screams
fruity
berry
goodness
if
youre
looking
for
a
fruity
interesting
beer
give
this
one
a
try
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
wonderful
and
the
fruit
overpowers
the
alcohol
enough
so
that
you
really
cant
taste
it
the
nose
on
it
is
very
enticing
this
is
another
great
beer
brewed
by
dfh
d
wouldd
be
a
great
desert
beer
or
you
could
nah
this
is
nice
anytime
on
another
note
it
made
em
crave
cheerios
which
i
eat
with
blue
black
or
raspberries
overall
i
do
love
fruit
beers
its
a
preferred
style
of
mine
knowing
that
though
i
havent
tried
a
hole
lot
of
them
but
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
everything
seemed
to
work
well
i
cant
wait
to
find
more
d
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
with
good
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
it
could
maybe
be
a
bit
more
bold
but
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
so
it
was
dangerously
easy
to
drink
great
beer
for
any
season
and
could
be
really
fun
with
food
pairing
i
enjoyed
this
better
than
red
white
overall
nice
berry
flavours
with
great
body
and
nice
level
of
sweetness
for
whats
going
on
in
this
one
just
a
little
boozy
but
its
forgivable
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
i
think
a
lot
of
wine
drinkers
might
enjoy
i
wouldnt
call
it
complex
by
any
means
and
the
belgian
golden
base
didnt
really
show
up
for
me
but
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
what
a
fruit
beer
can
be
o
hmm
this
beer
is
very
different
in
a
good
way
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
name
and
what
its
supposed
to
be
good
not
a
must
have
o
i
did
not
like
this
beer
pours
a
clean
and
clear
coppery
gold
color
small
cap
of
white
head
lingers
and
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
scent
is
dominated
by
the
promised
notes
of
blueberry
and
blackberry
faint
notes
of
alcohol
follow
with
a
moderate
amount
of
grahmn
cracker
sweetness
taste
again
is
fruit
forward
especially
at
serving
temp
blueberry
is
at
the
front
with
a
light
tartness
blackberry
and
faint
hints
of
concentrated
grape
juice
slightly
cloying
by
time
the
10oz
is
over
a
grahmn
crackery
sweetness
seems
to
intensify
as
the
drink
warms
a
little
spice
comes
out
as
well
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
moderate
lightly
dry
overall
i
prefered
this
to
the
bottle
the
fruit
stood
out
more
even
though
the
beer
felt
more
one
dimensional
o
didnt
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
dfh
is
phenomenal
but
blueberry
beer
but
it
works
it
tastes
good
and
its
definitely
refreshing
good
stuff
its
actually
not
half
bad
the
alcohol
is
a
little
high
which
gives
off
some
wine
like
characteristics
and
makes
it
a
little
tough
to
punch
through
a
bomber
still
miles
ahead
of
blackberry
witbier
by
sam
adams
though
pretty
decent
albeit
onesided
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
like
fruit
beers
in
general
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
especially
ringing
in
at
10
slap
a
new
glarus
label
on
this
and
i
bet
it
would
rate
out
to
an
a
average
at
least
cheers
dogfish
nice
job
on
this
one
black
blue
is
just
an
okay
release
from
dogfish
head
its
not
a
complete
disaster
but
a
couple
of
tweaks
would
help
primarily
less
berry
flavor
and
less
alcohol
flavorwarmth
if
youre
into
berry
flavored
beverages
you
just
might
like
it
irrespective
of
your
taste
it
is
worth
a
try
at
least
once
o
a
bit
of
a
surprise
i
didnt
expect
the
sweetness
without
the
alcohol
bite
very
smooth
well
balanced
beer
i
like
subtle
flavors
and
heavy
on
the
anything
tends
to
make
me
miss
the
point
this
beer
did
that
however
i
think
paired
with
the
right
food
it
could
be
delicious
but
on
its
own
this
wasnt
for
me
d
a
unique
blend
of
styles
that
challenges
the
senses
the
nose
is
more
fruit
than
belgian
the
palette
is
more
belgian
than
fruit
enjoyable
all
the
way
around
the
only
complaint
is
that
this
on
is
ever
so
slightly
cloying
overall
a
pretty
nice
effort
for
a
fruit
beer
the
berry
aroma
and
taste
is
well
presented
nice
beer
for
a
warm
spring
night
oi
had
this
a
very
long
time
ago
and
in
my
memory
it
was
a
miss
of
a
beer
maybe
my
taste
buds
have
matured
but
wow
im
loving
this
i
wish
it
werent
so
expensive
because
i
could
buy
a
case
of
this
and
drink
it
this
bottle
might
not
be
for
sharing
because
it
goes
down
so
easily
especially
considering
the
abv
this
is
extremely
good
and
definitely
quaffable
this
is
how
a
fruit
beer
should
be
soft
flavors
with
amazing
bouquet
of
dark
fruit
but
the
alcohol
backbone
to
round
it
out
into
a
fine
fine
beer
dogfish
just
knows
how
to
do
these
different
beers
correctly
love
just
about
everything
from
them
this
is
in
my
top
5
of
favorite
beers
ooverall
i
think
this
is
a
great
fruit
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
everyday
but
it
would
be
nice
to
have
on
a
mild
summer
night
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
on
the
side
this
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
beer
style
but
i
think
that
this
beer
is
very
greatly
crafted
and
is
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
fruit
beer
draft
to
snifter
beer
looks
good
not
that
im
sure
what
it
should
look
like
but
it
had
the
depth
representative
of
black
and
blue
berries
so
its
gotta
be
labeled
good
at
minimum
the
bouquet
was
also
good
the
fruit
was
wellrepresented
taste
was
excellent
the
flavors
poured
through
nicely
mouthfeel
was
good
definitely
a
sipper
overall
a
good
beer
that
ill
definitely
be
ordering
again
do
pretty
much
nothing
but
fruit
throughout
this
one
which
is
ideal
nothing
fancy
just
a
nice
mix
of
berries
and
beer
yum
o
plenty
of
fruit
in
the
nose
and
mouth
the
starchy
buttery
flavors
add
a
different
dimension
here
o
the
nose
is
fantastic
and
the
beer
opens
with
a
great
berry
flavor
but
the
medicinal
backend
sandbags
this
brew
from
really
getting
off
the
ground
drinkability
is
high
theres
a
good
amount
of
booze
in
this
one
but
its
very
enjoyable
and
goes
down
easy
not
hard
to
kill
the
750ml
alone
but
at
10abv
you
need
to
be
careful
i
had
this
in
a
750ml
bottle
and
kept
it
in
my
fridge
for
just
a
little
too
long
i
think
still
good
kind
of
tasted
like
a
sweet
tripel
poured
semicloudy
orangebrown
with
a
nice
white
head
fresh
fruit
on
the
nose
i
got
hit
with
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
right
away
which
made
the
blueberry
a
bit
harsh
and
acidic
followed
up
by
bright
malty
sweetness
with
some
light
sugars
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
harsh
but
i
could
tell
it
was
because
i
let
it
sit
in
the
fridge
too
long
so
i
cant
really
blame
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
pink
color
like
a
late
day
sunnyset
there
is
a
two
finger
soapy
white
head
whiches
recedes
to
skim
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
sides
very
nice
long
very
inviting
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
blueberries
and
blackberries
with
a
hint
of
graininess
the
smell
is
very
inviting
not
a
complex
smell
but
a
very
good
smell
the
taste
follows
the
nose
exactly
a
big
blueberry
and
blackberry
taste
with
a
hint
of
malt
to
balance
out
the
flavors
sweet
and
smooth
taste
very
good
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
and
is
slightly
dry
kinda
wine
like
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
nice
taste
for
a
fruit
beer
upper
ratings
there
but
the
smell
is
very
nice
this
is
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
and
again
o
fruity
and
enjoyable
4
o
a
well
crafted
brew
the
fruit
flavors
are
quite
authentic
and
not
sugary
imposters
i
will
finish
this
bottle
myself
and
if
i
had
more
id
probably
drink
it
o
a
very
interesting
fruit
beer
nothing
i
could
drink
3
or
4
of
but
a
nice
sipping
beer
cheers
overall
some
nice
blueberry
notes
that
are
at
times
overwhelmed
by
too
many
medicinal
notes
the
blackberry
also
really
never
comes
through
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
not
really
worth
getting
more
than
once
in
my
opinion
overall
i
choose
red
white
i
think
black
blue
lacks
a
uniqueness
to
separate
itself
from
other
blueberryflavored
beers
i
could
probably
get
a
sixpack
of
another
blueberry
beer
for
the
same
price
as
i
paid
for
this
bottled
pint
and
get
a
very
similar
taste
that
being
said
i
have
had
some
blueberryflavored
wheats
that
are
artificially
flavored
and
taste
nothing
like
blueberries
this
beer
is
not
that
hopeless
had
a
sample
last
night
at
the
brewpub
in
rehoboth
im
normally
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
had
to
try
this
one
wow
belgian
strong
with
blackberries
and
blueberries
berries
very
noticeable
in
the
aromaflavor
but
i
dont
know
if
i
didnt
know
what
they
were
that
i
would
have
been
able
to
tell
very
well
balanced
between
maltiness
and
fruit
flavor
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
full
pint
but
this
is
a
perfectly
executed
fruit
beer
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
style
however
at
10
a
bottle
only
a
few
can
afford
to
drink
much
of
this
one
received
a
bottle
of
this
one
as
a
gift
from
my
wife
for
some
holiday
or
other
poured
a
reddishorange
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
somewhat
tart
on
the
nose
with
aromas
of
dark
berries
alcohol
and
candi
sugar
medium
bodied
and
tart
with
flavors
of
dark
berries
candi
sugar
and
booze
eh
this
is
a
beer
that
is
not
sure
what
it
wants
to
be
pours
an
attractive
reddish
color
impressive
head
with
some
decent
lacing
not
as
much
berry
scent
on
the
nose
as
one
would
expect
it
is
there
but
its
not
strong
tastes
of
fermented
raspberries
not
much
hops
or
too
much
of
anything
else
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
syrupy
like
i
expected
ok
beer
nothing
i
would
go
out
and
buy
again
if
i
saw
this
again
where
i
usually
frequent
i
would
buy
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
not
this
time
id
rather
drink
a
macro
lager
than
this
really
huge
thumbs
down
for
the
price
i
wont
buy
up
the
store
but
if
i
see
another
bottle
i
am
most
likely
going
to
snag
it
d
this
ale
is
drinkable
but
would
prefer
more
tartness
from
the
berries
if
at
all
possible
d
crisp
and
refreshing
great
fruit
profile
yet
sort
of
straightforward
still
enjoyable
and
tasty
definitely
a
good
fruit
beer
d
this
is
always
a
repeat
beer
for
me
i
find
it
perfect
for
sipping
while
sitting
around
a
nice
big
campfire
this
definitely
isnt
your
ordinary
beer
but
the
flavors
alone
make
this
very
worthy
these
are
the
kind
of
beers
i
expect
from
dfh
well
done
recommended
overall
i
thought
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
enjoyed
every
aspect
of
the
brew
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
d
drank
the
750ml
by
myself
so
i
would
say
its
very
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
fruity
but
well
balanced
not
overly
sweet
delicious
carbonated
moderately
with
a
dry
overall
feel
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmness
in
the
end
overall
impression
pleasant
enough
but
rather
forgettable
easily
had
a
couple
glasses
of
this
a
must
share
with
dinner
or
after
overall
a
solid
fruit
beer
form
dogfish
head
d
wow
you
can
slam
this
dfh
making
another
drinkable
brew
for
the
ladies
and
me
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
appreciated
the
genuine
fruit
taste
as
opposed
to
fruit
flavorings
its
a
nice
sipper
but
i
still
like
the
belgian
lambics
a
lot
better
i
drank
almost
the
entire
750ml
myself
so
yeah
its
pretty
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
bit
above
average
drinkability
was
good
it
was
a
pretty
good
fruit
centered
beer
with
some
good
and
fresh
berry
flavors
it
had
a
fruit
juice
like
quality
to
it
that
was
pretty
good
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
as
mentioned
before
this
brew
drinks
more
like
a
wine
then
a
beer
but
i
find
it
goes
down
quite
well
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
times
before
and
always
thought
it
was
better
with
food
i
think
this
is
one
of
dfhs
more
successful
tangents
pours
a
moderate
reddish
brown
color
with
a
light
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
but
a
decent
amount
of
retention
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
are
pretty
much
consumed
by
the
berry
additions
although
there
is
a
bit
of
booze
in
there
as
well
drinks
fairly
well
at
the
moment
though
im
guessing
this
would
get
much
better
as
it
mellows
out
a
bit
with
some
age
d
you
gotta
give
it
to
dfh
for
continuously
pushing
the
envelope
on
what
beer
can
be
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
one
to
try
and
could
be
a
great
replacement
to
the
bottle
of
wine
for
a
dinner
party
but
all
in
all
not
something
that
i
would
ever
pick
up
in
a
6er
if
it
were
available
d
drink
it
like
wine
cheers
easy
driner
despite
the
abv
not
hot
at
all
other
reviews
cite
hotness
i
did
not
experience
that
overall
this
was
fun
to
try
as
it
always
is
with
the
folks
from
dogfish
head
drinkability
is
moderate
though
at
10
and
being
bottle
in
the
stadard
big
beer
pint
as
per
dfh
specialty
brews
2
5
d
definitely
not
one
of
dfhs
best
the
only
thing
good
about
this
is
the
appearance
but
in
the
scheme
of
things
important
that
doesnt
mean
much
boring
smell
boring
taste
boring
mouthfeel
thus
not
very
drinkable
and
worse
if
you
factor
in
price
the
color
is
an
amberdeep
red
it
has
a
thin
cream
colored
head
the
smell
is
strong
pundget
and
fruity
sweet
and
tangy
at
first
sip
it
is
malty
sweet
and
smooth
you
can
taste
the
tangyness
bitterness
and
sweetness
that
black
raspverries
and
blueberries
pack
in
the
back
end
of
the
beer
you
can
almost
taste
the
skin
of
the
fruit
this
beer
isnt
as
sweet
as
you
would
expect
like
most
fruit
beers
overall
pretty
good
d
kind
of
tasty
compared
to
most
fruit
beers
goes
down
dangerously
easy
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
certainly
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
that
ive
had
overall
good
but
there
are
better
fruit
beers
at
a
better
price
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
white
head
the
head
dissipates
to
small
beading
over
several
sips
the
aroma
is
of
blackberry
jam
ripe
blueberries
and
a
spiciness
from
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
cloying
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
and
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
alcohol
is
present
but
its
not
super
boozey
for
10
the
carbonation
is
medium
to
low
and
very
fine
overall
a
nicely
brewed
strong
fruit
beer
drinkability
refreshing
with
a
nice
bit
of
tartness
but
lacks
the
complexity
i
would
have
expected
fullbodied
chewy
mouthfeel
with
mediumlow
carbonation
with
this
type
of
flavor
profile
personally
im
not
going
to
have
a
lot
of
it
but
i
would
be
more
than
open
to
a
revisit
at
some
future
point
overall
impression
interesting
flavor
definitely
worth
trying
again
but
i
cant
have
it
on
a
regular
basis
dont
drink
too
coldyoull
miss
the
unique
character
drinkability
the
combination
of
the
high
abvs
the
dirty
iced
tea
look
the
sweet
berry
smell
and
the
gross
sour
flavor
on
the
tastebuds
make
this
a
difficult
beer
to
have
too
much
of
wish
i
had
a
taste
of
this
before
i
bought
a
whole
22oz
bottle
the
labels
states
ingredients
include
black
rasberry
and
blueberry
puree
but
the
taste
is
more
like
a
near
flat
peach
lambic
with
a
strong
alcohol
not
quite
sure
what
kind
of
meal
i
would
pair
this
with
maybe
some
nice
old
world
cheeses
share
the
25oz
bottle
with
friends
one
glass
is
enough
per
person
pretty
decent
overall
definitely
more
interesting
than
a
stock
golden
ale
or
fruit
beer
but
the
payoff
isnt
quite
all
there
this
beer
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
could
be
a
real
winner
m
d
i
could
drink
this
like
juice
and
am
get
a
bit
of
carbonation
on
sip
and
it
is
amazing
the
scent
and
aftertaste
make
this
easy
to
drink
first
bottle
i
sipped
second
bottle
i
am
drinking
like
a
bum
with
his
thunderbird
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
slightly
overpriced
and
harder
to
find
that
most
dogfish
head
brews
abv
is
also
kinda
much
but
if
non
of
the
above
are
problems
for
you
seek
it
out
drinkability
is
okay
sometimes
its
too
rich
like
molasses
and
other
times
it
seems
just
right
cant
drink
very
many
of
these
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
confusing
to
the
personality
of
this
beer
because
the
body
is
so
substantial
and
filling
it
makes
you
think
winter
but
the
taste
is
so
sweetly
delicate
although
robust
as
well
that
it
makes
you
think
summer
summer
to
me
is
typically
a
more
drinkable
beer
i
am
willing
to
bet
as
sam
calagione
founder
and
president
of
dogfish
head
often
mentions
that
this
beer
will
be
best
in
two
years
the
fruit
should
come
to
the
forefront
a
touch
as
the
yeast
dries
the
beer
out
crating
what
i
expect
to
be
a
more
tart
and
spicier
drink
right
now
though
it
is
easy
to
enjoy
on
its
own
or
with
almost
any
sort
of
cheese
pasta
pizza
fried
fish
or
cheesecake
mmmmm
try
it
with
cheesecake
bottle
pours
a
definite
bluepurple
tinged
color
with
a
slight
purple
head
fruit
smell
along
with
a
slight
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
a
touch
more
alcoholic
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
fairly
smooth
nonetheless
belgian
ale
taste
with
a
nice
fruit
finish
lightmedium
mouthfeel
as
a
fruit
beer
i
just
wish
it
had
a
stronger
fruit
profile
d
as
was
with
the
red
white
the
10
abv
makes
the
drinkability
low
for
me
also
while
i
love
black
raspberries
the
taste
with
the
alcohol
was
a
little
overpowering
poured
a
bottle
dated
december
of
2009
it
poured
a
light
amber
with
good
reddish
tint
in
the
light
the
head
was
slight
and
cream
colored
the
smell
was
amazing
it
wreaked
of
raspberries
perhaps
blackberries
and
was
both
sweet
and
tart
the
taste
was
very
good
but
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
that
the
scent
does
it
makes
you
crave
the
berry
accents
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
its
rather
light
to
medium
in
body
for
the
style
its
very
drinkable
it
is
delicious
and
completely
hides
the
alcohol
i
love
this
beer
and
would
greatly
recommend
it
if
only
it
werent
so
expensive
but
aged
bottles
are
definitely
worth
it
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
a
clear
amber
color
although
spottingly
white
the
beer
has
a
mostly
nonexistent
head
its
aroma
is
fruity
predominantly
blueberry
with
a
touch
of
other
fruit
there
is
a
notable
malt
scent
as
well
theres
virtually
no
hop
scent
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
a
firm
bitterness
although
theres
a
lot
of
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
yeast
its
a
fairly
clean
beer
medium
body
and
quite
drinkable
the
beer
is
straightforward
and
interesting
its
not
particularly
engaging
however
its
a
reasonably
good
fruit
beer
not
much
more
d
for
me
i
must
drink
it
cold
not
chilled
and
thats
do
to
the
fact
the
raspberry
flavor
comes
out
more
which
i
did
not
care
for
to
much
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
not
what
i
was
really
hoping
for
from
this
brew
and
its
another
example
of
dfh
falling
short
on
their
fruit
beers
to
me
d
as
one
of
the
beers
ive
personally
hyped
to
hell
in
my
head
it
didnt
really
live
up
to
it
in
the
end
though
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
better
than
red
and
white
for
me
a
unique
flavour
d
as
much
as
i
did
enjoy
this
i
dont
think
id
have
another
one
with
age
on
it
i
will
definately
try
it
fresh
and
compare
the
difference
very
easy
beer
to
drink
note
30
dec
2013
had
a
glass
of
this
last
night
and
found
myself
enjoying
it
more
this
time
than
i
had
when
i
reviewed
it
the
fruits
came
through
nicely
and
the
whole
seemed
more
drinkable
that
i
gave
it
credit
for
d
medium
drinkability
i
split
this
bottle
with
a
few
friends
and
was
perfectly
happy
with
my
portion
definitely
gets
more
cloying
as
you
drink
but
an
interesting
and
unique
brew
nonetheless
d
this
beer
is
very
approachable
and
drinkable
it
has
nice
fresh
fruit
aroma
and
flavor
but
has
enough
complexity
and
beer
notes
to
avoid
seeming
like
fruit
juice
or
a
wine
cooler
overall
a
surprisingly
good
fruit
beer
i
expected
a
sweet
syrupy
mess
but
it
wasnt
like
that
at
all
drinkability
is
above
average
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
not
one
that
is
excessively
drinkable
but
one
that
would
be
good
to
split
with
friends
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
25
6
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
large
dfh
snifter
it
is
a
light
red
color
translucent
with
a
fizzy
inch
or
so
of
head
smell
is
very
acidic
with
a
winelike
berry
presence
blackberries
blueberries
and
raspberries
are
all
very
prevalent
in
the
smell
taste
is
a
sourtart
blend
of
berries
with
an
emphasis
on
blackberries
and
raspberries
mouthfeel
is
very
acidic
and
fizzy
alcohol
is
present
but
hidden
fairly
well
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
mingling
of
fruit
and
beer
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
d
im
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
black
blue
it
is
very
palatable
not
something
for
constant
imbibement
of
course
but
it
has
its
time
and
place
would
be
a
good
beer
for
wine
heads
first
review
so
forgive
some
inexperience
a
nice
beer
for
late
in
the
night
and
drinking
alone
wouldnt
pair
very
well
with
food
but
does
well
alone
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
id
get
again
unlike
dfhs
red
white
the
alcohol
is
not
masked
but
that
might
be
intentional
in
order
to
balance
the
fruitiness
md
it
is
a
little
thick
but
in
a
good
way
not
in
a
heavy
stout
way
it
has
good
carbonation
and
i
put
down
a
good
bit
of
the
750ml
bottle
it
is
great
to
split
among
a
couple
of
people
where
you
each
get
a
glass
or
so
mouthfeel
a
bit
tart
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smells
of
sweet
berries
candy
sugar
higher
alcohols
lightly
phenolic
the
taste
is
not
really
what
i
expected
from
the
nose
lacking
is
much
in
the
way
of
berry
sweetness
i
get
a
bit
of
tartness
mixed
with
a
malty
sweetness
before
i
feel
the
twinge
of
alcohol
descend
from
my
lips
down
my
gullet
splashing
into
my
stomach
tart
sticky
mouthfeel
medium
to
thick
body
medium
level
of
carbonation
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
i
found
the
tartness
and
the
flavor
tasty
but
the
alcohol
burn
was
a
bit
to
much
for
me
maybe
an
aged
bottle
of
this
would
be
better
i
dont
think
i
liked
it
well
enough
to
put
forth
the
effort
to
age
though
d
tartness
limits
this
to
a
shared
750ml
bottle
though
a
strong
maduro
cigar
helps
to
balance
out
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
the
high
level
of
fruity
flavors
makes
this
beer
one
to
be
sipped
flavor
lots
of
fruit
drinks
more
like
a
wine
quite
yeasty
and
following
with
a
lot
of
ester
i
started
to
drink
this
while
it
was
still
pretty
cold
out
of
the
fridge
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
fruit
really
showed
itself
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
made
it
much
nicer
to
drink
clear
bright
reddish
orange
in
color
nice
lacing
berries
berries
more
berries
on
the
nose
black
berry
does
dominate
however
lambicstyle
sour
in
the
taste
with
mouthcoating
consistency
estery
nice
warming
finish
d
dangerously
drinkable
in
warm
weather
gives
no
hint
of
the
abv
d
this
does
not
feel
like
a
beer
but
it
is
not
bad
if
you
do
get
a
bottle
be
ready
to
split
it
with
someone
because
half
a
bottle
is
all
that
one
person
needs
in
a
night
d
well
i
wanted
to
try
these
beers
for
a
reason
to
sample
extreme
beers
on
the
cheap
this
accomplished
this
as
this
was
my
second
favorite
along
side
of
a
few
others
of
6
beers
sampled
an
earlier
reviewer
mentioned
that
it
might
mature
to
good
things
if
left
alone
and
perhaps
thats
the
case
as
it
is
this
bottle
turned
me
off
completely
especially
having
had
the
wonderful
dfhstonevictory
saison
du
buff
a
couple
of
hours
beforehand
d
dfh
is
a
brewery
i
respect
immensely
but
i
think
they
can
do
better
than
this
i
dont
dislike
it
and
would
likely
drink
it
again
if
offered
to
me
but
in
terms
of
flavor
it
could
have
been
more
powerful
still
worthy
of
a
quaff
dogfish
head
black
and
blue
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
sediment
there
was
a
medium
sized
head
that
had
a
purple
color
to
it
it
smelt
of
hops
blueberries
and
rasberries
so
overall
sweet
and
bitter
it
had
a
very
unquie
taste
first
it
had
a
typical
dogfish
head
bitternes
then
a
taste
of
blueberries
and
rasberries
and
it
finished
sweet
and
smooth
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
overall
a
great
beer
very
unquie
and
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
deffently
worth
a
shot
and
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
pours
a
sparkling
clear
amber
color
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
average
fluffy
fizzy
head
followed
with
good
lacing
very
berry
smell
with
a
taste
that
follows
much
the
same
has
a
bit
of
a
light
fruity
wine
flavor
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
not
the
least
bit
noticable
thin
fizzy
feel
and
very
sweet
probably
to
sweet
to
drink
in
bulk
but
could
definitely
drink
every
day
first
beer
i
drank
that
could
quench
my
thirst
could
drink
this
shit
at
halftimef
gatorade
pass
me
a
black
blue
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
certainly
something
you
should
consider
trying
i
dont
recommend
you
run
out
today
and
try
to
find
a
bottle
but
if
you
come
accross
one
and
can
find
it
for
a
reasonable
price
less
than
11
99
which
is
what
i
paid
for
the
25
6
ounce
bottle
i
purchsed
then
i
suggest
you
add
it
to
your
cart
at
any
rate
its
an
interesting
beer
the
bottle
labeling
is
artistically
considerate
and
its
brewed
by
a
fine
brewery
as
much
like
wine
as
beer
id
drink
this
like
a
bottle
of
wine
uncork
it
drink
it
appreciate
it
then
have
again
at
a
later
date
mouthfeel
is
complementary
dry
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
great
and
it
goes
well
with
food
i
had
mine
with
a
ribeye
this
has
very
high
carbonation
much
like
a
german
wheat
beer
or
the
like
feels
tingly
and
alive
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
content
also
warms
you
greatly
while
being
consumed
truly
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
one
bottle
may
not
be
enough
great
drinkability
for
such
a
heavy
hitter
notes
a
treat
to
find
this
one
on
tap
thanks
again
mr
p
d
a
pretty
good
beer
as
i
mentioned
it
grew
on
me
bit
by
bit
not
something
id
buy
regularly
however
especially
with
all
the
other
dfh
beers
that
are
so
great
drink
is
ok
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
d
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
fruitvegetable
beers
but
this
one
is
very
well
made
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
fruit
beer
that
would
go
great
with
a
gourmet
meal
it
seemed
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
but
otherwise
very
well
done
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
tank
7
tulip
poured
a
reddish
gold
with
a
thin
pink
tinged
head
fruity
aroma
that
is
slightly
tart
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
lots
of
fruit
berries
obviously
in
the
flavor
a
bit
of
tart
acidity
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
apparent
this
got
better
as
it
warmed
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
though
decent
fruit
beer
itd
be
nice
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
d
the
sweetness
makes
this
a
sipper
its
a
good
beer
but
god
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
a
bomber
in
an
evening
id
assume
it
would
be
really
good
with
some
sort
of
berry
pie
for
dessert
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
slighty
purplish
brown
tint
aromas
of
blueberries
citrus
fruits
such
as
grapfruits
and
lemons
along
with
some
yeasty
bread
dough
smells
the
flavor
is
very
interesting
starting
off
with
lots
of
blueberries
with
the
raspberries
not
showing
up
until
the
very
end
plenty
of
tart
citrus
and
sour
dough
flavors
show
up
between
all
the
berry
fruits
the
beer
seems
to
have
lots
of
fruit
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
no
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
sour
the
carbonation
comes
off
a
little
light
the
alcohol
seems
more
apparent
in
the
beer
compared
to
othe
dfh
fruit
themed
beers
i
have
tried
a
very
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
not
one
i
would
run
out
to
get
again
slainte
d
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
probably
wont
be
a
regular
one
from
me
pretty
expensive
too
this
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
d
really
good
for
a
big
beer
like
this
but
id
expect
nothing
less
from
dfh
sam
co
are
masters
of
hiding
booze
in
these
big
beers
hardly
any
head
at
all
even
with
a
somewhat
aggressive
pour
gone
quickly
with
no
lacing
to
be
seen
murky
orange
rust
color
with
some
brownish
orange
brick
hues
too
brightens
a
touch
around
the
rims
the
berry
scents
come
through
clearly
in
the
nose
however
these
are
nowhere
near
being
dominant
grapefruit
and
tangerine
citrus
there
raw
brown
sugar
peat
moss
lighter
yeasty
bread
dough
sweeter
maltiness
more
apparent
as
it
warms
fullbodied
dry
sour
and
borderline
acidic
really
gives
your
palate
a
nice
twist
as
in
the
nose

at

like
it

thought
it
would
be
a

done

is
definitely
there

it
is
different
than
you
expect
the

is
balanced
with
a

of

somewhere
between

and

ale
on
the

scale
besides
the
presence
of
fermented
fruit
this
really
has
no

of

whatsoever
the

also
very

this

is
definitely
one

beers
out
there
that
i
have
tried

much
better
than
in

really
this
is
one
i
could
drink
all

even
though
i
do
appreciate
the
lambics
now

again
to
me
this
was
sort
of
in

it
wasnt
a
true
lambic
and
it
wasnt

though
it
was
powerful
i
am
hard
pressed
to
place
this
beer
in
any
one
category
and
becasue
of
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
compare
to
others
i
probably
would
not
get
this
particular
one
again

i
look

to
trying
other

this
beer
is
not
my
thing
incredibly
drinkable
for
its
potency
but
not
as
cool
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
still
hats
off
as
always
to
dogfish
head
for
trying
something
new
d
rather
underwhelming
offering
particularly
for
a
fruit
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
even
tell
this
was
a
fruit
beer
in
a
blind
taste
test
this
was
good
for
a
group
beer
tasting
but
i
probably
wont
go
in
for
round
two
anytime
soon
i
thought
this
beer
was
decent
but
it
may
have
been
just
a
bit
too
mellow
a
mix
of
half
this
and
half
forte
i
think
would
be
perfect
not
very
fruity
and
kind
of
boring
all
gimmicks
aside
probably
my
least
favorite
dfh
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
a
really
good
beer
but
i
feel
like
the
same
flavor
could
be
acheived
at
much
lower
abv
id
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pay
for
it
drinkablility
fine
ill
drink
it
more
because
of
what
i
paid
for
it
rather
than
whats
inside
the
bottle
probably
the
biggest
disappointment
ive
experienced
from
dfh
a
total
180
from
their
red
and
white
which
i
thought
was
very
good
drinks
easy
i
could
see
the
alcohol
in
this
one
creeping
up
on
me
rapidly
drinkability
is
decent
with
the
11abv
nearly
impossible
to
detect
anywhere
but
in
your
hangover
overall
not
too
bad
glad
my
beer
guy
kept
one
back
for
me
to
try
i
missed
out
on
the
red
white
which
is
unfortunate
since
it
gets
really
good
reviews
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
fruit
beer
but
is
somewhat
lacking
in
taste
i
with
dfh
would
have
put
a
little
more
berry
punch
in
this
one
highmarks
for
feel
and
drinkability
it
drinks
like
a
smooth
wine
where
other
smooth
fruit
beers
are
simply
juicelike
the
flavor
however
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
its
just
bland
theres
mellow
light
malt
profile
with
a
touch
of
blueberries
but
thats
it
it
might
be
a
decent
in
not
expensive
gateway
beer
for
wine
drinkers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
good
carbonation
this
one
goes
down
really
easily
considering
the
abv
and
i
could
see
it
getting
me
in
trouble
if
i
drank
too
much
theres
really
no
alcohol
flavor
at
all
in
here
overall
an
interesting
brew
but
it
didnt
really
grab
me
enough
to
want
to
buy
another
bottle
at
the
price
point
it
sells
for
theres
many
other
things
i
would
choose
first
decent
drinkability
sort
of
a
big
sticky
beer
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
actually
overall
worth
a
try
but
nothing
id
come
back
to
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
purple
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
blueberry
scent
with
very
little
malt
aroma
the
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
mild
fruit
flavor
that
boasts
of
black
raspberries
and
blueberries
the
malt
bill
seems
quite
simple
and
lacking
character
i
understand
this
is
a
fruit
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
do
much
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
average
its
a
full
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
real
letdown
i
was
hoping
for
something
bold
but
it
really
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
pretty
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
11
but
was
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
glass
drinkability
the
real
loser
in
all
of
this
is
me
as
i
still
have
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
waiting
for
me
at
home
the
bottled
date
on
this
one
was
21307
so
it
had
almost
exactly
4
months
aging
it
pours
a
very
dark
rich
red
color
with
no
head
there
are
visible
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
my
dfh
snifter
the
only
smell
i
get
off
of
this
is
a
winetype
aroma
and
it
isnt
very
strong
i
like
that
the
fruit
is
fairly
subtle
or
at
least
not
with
the
usual
accompanying
sweetness
the
raspberries
are
up
front
and
as
they
fade
out
the
blueberries
step
to
the
front
its
almost
hard
to
think
of
this
as
a
beer
as
it
tastes
and
feels
more
like
a
wine
i
do
get
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
in
the
background
but
just
a
very
little
bit
i
like
this
beer
for
what
it
is
and
im
interested
to
see
if
aging
will
change
it
at
all
my
guess
is
that
it
will
probably
only
hold
its
own
or
go
downward
750

12
oz
sample
the
beer
is
a
deep
rose
to
light
red
color
with
a
tight
2
finger
that
falls
to
a
nice
coating
over
top
of
the
brew
clarity
is
moderate
and
there
is
a
small
carbonation
running
through
the
glass
the
aroma
is
giving
me
definite
blackberry
fruityness
that
sits
over
a
base
that
reminds
me
of
wheaty
beers
and
is
the
same
as
i
have
found
in
the
red
and
white
and
fort
the
flavor
is
a
little
subdued
to
me
the
fruityness
is
dominant
but
it
is
also
interrupted
by
a
detectable
alcohol
character
it
really
seems
to
be
somewhat
distant
in
the
flavor
category
id
like
a
more
prevalent
character
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
a
mild
carbonation
i
think
the
alcohol
character
works
towards
making
the
beer
feel
more
thin
overall
i
am
finding
this
beer
interesting
it
delivers
what
i
expected
just
not
in
the
quantities
as
far
as
flavor
goes
crimson
tinged
amber
robe
little
to
no
head
at
the
pour
and
whats
left
dissipates
quickly
fruity
in
the
nose
but
not
nearly
as
bold
as
you
might
expect
the
flavor
is
sugary
but
not
sweet
and
its
not
boldly
fruity
theres
some
black
raspberry
but
not
so
much
blueberry
jam
like
its
only
subtly
tart
and
it
could
stand
a
little
tartness
to
balance
the
sugary
side
the
alcohol
is
present
though
although
its
not
rough
and
actually
seems
to
work
within
the
dextrinous
flavor
and
body
interesting
drinkable
more
of
an
apertif
or
nightcap
beer
pours
a
light
amber
in
color
clear
with
a
bright
soapy
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
aroma
is
strong
of
berries
no
surprise
and
also
shows
some
lemon
and
perfumy
soapiness
taste
shows
both
raspberry
and
blueberry
mingling
with
a
good
sized
malty
sweetness
some
crisp
carbonation
esp
when
cold
and
a
dry
and
perfumy
finish
medium
in
body
nice
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
barely
evident
for
its
size
however
all
of
th
flavors
seem
to
be
fighting
each
other
rather
than
blending
well
together
i
like
my
fruit
beers
to
either
be
slightly
lighter
in
body
i
found
the
bigger
maltiness
didnt
blend
well
with
the
berries
or
to
be
more
singularly
focused
on
the
fruit
flavor
here
things
seem
to
be
competing
glad
that
dfh
is
pumping
out
new
and
different
product
this

isnt

no
lacing
but
a
fascinating
color
the
smell
is
still
a
little
hot
but
beyond
the
alcohol
is
a
hit
of
yeast
and
dry
dark
berries
the
taste
is
also
quite
yeasty
and
there
are
more
dark
berry
flavors
not
sweet
at
all
rather
the
flavor
is
more
jammy
as
found
in
a
wine
the
blueberries
are
more
prominent
tasting
the
black
raspberry
at
least
initially
but
as
it
warms
the
raspberry
becomes
more
evident
dry
and
very
drinkable
but
definitely
a
big
beer
i
like
it
drinkability
this
is
a
unique
fruit
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
trying
because
of
the
nice
flavors
but
to
me
this
is
a
one
bottle
one
time
of
year
beer
and
if
it
comes
out
next
year
ill
probably
pick
one
up
an
outstanding
pro
for
this
beverage
is
its
10
abv
and
its
unbelievably
coy
drinkability
going
into
this
i
feared
i
was
spending
14
for
a
fruity
malt
liquor
and
my
fears
were
confirmed
once
again
dogfish
head
suckered
me
into
ponying
up
way
to
much
another
one
of
their
failed
experiments
im
beginning
to
really
resent
this
brewery
in
spite
of
their
occasional
hits
kinda
like
microsoft
software
im
tried
of
paying
for
the
privilege
of
beta
testing
resist
the
temptation
it
may
sound
good
and
has
a
cool
label
but
is
definitely
not
recommended
poured
into
a
pint
glass

an

with
minimal
pink

that

a
bit
of

on
the
glass

is
sweet
berries
and
fruit
also
a
bit
of
bread
in
the
nose
taste
hits
my
tongue
with
a
tarte
taste
of
berries
and
a
bit
of
malt
character
little
carbonation
but
quite
smooth
it
has
a
unique
taset
and
one
i
truly
enjoyed
this
was
a
fine
and
different
offering
very
good
i
was
expecting
it
to
not
be
as
good
as
it
was
drinkability
is
very
high
for
such
a
high
abv
on
a
beer
this
went
down
smooth
and
under
control
i
could
drink
this
fine
beverage
all
day
long
eric
hot
heavy
alcohol
presence
too
much
for
my
liking
with
a
cloying
barleywine
distinction
not
as
fruitwinelike
as
i
would
have
expected
not
refreshing
not
very
complex
dfh
hasnt
impressed
me
in
quite
a
while
now
i
think
im
done
giving
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
my
money
cheers
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
meduim
body
the
beer
is
very
medicinal
and
boozey
in
mouthfeel
as
stated
previously
this
beer
doesnt
really
work
for
me
the
beer
was
drinkable
and
nowhere
near
a
sink
pour
however
the
beer
just
doesnt
work
for
me
on
so
many
levels
i
got
a
drinking
experience
from
this
similar
to
having
berry
extract
added
to
my
malt
liquor
with
that
said
i
know
the
beer
is
experimental
i
have
enjoyed
numerous
experimental
brews
i
will
most
likely
buy
another
dfh
experimental
beer
thanks
for
continueing
to
push
the
envelope
overall
like
many
of
dfhs
specialty
beers
this
one
is
interesting
and
pricey
and
overall
not
terribly
remarkable
i
only
bought
it
because
it
was
a
limited
release
i
vastly
prefer
dfhs
more
established
offerings
such
as
their
90
minute
ipa
worth
trying
for
obsessive
completists
such
as
myself
or
if
you
just
love
niche
craft
beers
what
an
odd
beer
it
tastes
like
a
40
mixed
with
a
berry
lambic
not
to
bad
but
not
a
beer
id
pay
for
again
d
there
are
some
subtle
hints
of
fruit
but
not
much
of
interest
in
this
beer
it
could
use
more
flavor
of
some
sorts
but
the
alcohol
is
very
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
1
lavender
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
bright
red
brew
head
holds
on
well
with
tons
of
slowfalling
lace
aroma
is
rich
an
d
fruity
without
the
intensity
that
sometimes
makes
one
think
artificial
taste
is
lightly
malty
with
somewhat
generic
fruitiness
coming
on
in
the
middle
and
becomes
more
blueberry
as
the
flavor
lingers
after
the
swallow
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
creamy
and
drinkability
is
not
bad
for
a
fruit
brew
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
probably
wouldnt
revisit
for
the
cost
your
mileage
may
vary
second
pour
from
the
bomber
was
from
up
high
results
yielded
a
nice
head
that
remained
for
awhile
alcohol
presence
came
through
as
it
warmed
more
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
characteristics
the
mouth
is
rather
syrupy
though
this
shouldnt
really
be
surprising
but
its
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
and
the
alcohol
is
overdone
defintely
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
if
looking
for
sweeter
brew
the
midas
touch
or
chateau
jihau
are
superior
the
beer
pours
an
amber
brown
color
with
very
good
head
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
closed
though
i
get
a
hint
of
ginger
and
malt
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
rich
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
honey
butter
and
melon
there
is
a
soft
creaminess
on
the
palate
and
the
beer
has
a
smooth
lingering
finish
the
abv
is
really
well
disguised
in
this
beer
knowing
sam
i
figured
it
would
be
up
there
but
this
does
not
taste
like
a
beer
with
an
11
abv
absolute
amazing
another
winner
from
dfh
the
color
was
very
impressive
a
gorgeous
red
amber
topped
with
an
inch
of
head
it
produced
a
nice
cherry
wood
smell
that
could
be
compared
to
watered
down
koolaid
if
i
were
very
cynical
the
taste
was
fruity
without
being
sweet
it
had
a
surprisingly
light
mouthfeel
but
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
later
i
found
it
enjoyable
but
like
other
dogfish
heads
you
dont
want
to
take
its
deceptive
lightness
for
granted
they
pack
a
powerful
punch
each
gulp
was
very
airy
as
it
went
down
yet
grants
a
buzz
the
smell
didnt
blow
me
away
it
hinted
at
some
sweetness
the
taste
wasnt
overwhelming
of
fruit
which
i
like
and
just
gave
a
hint
of
blueberry
and
blackberry
in
the
sweetness
as
you
sipped
not
much
in
the
line
of
hops
and
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
evident
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
to
sip
over
a
couple
of
hours
it
would
make
a
nice
dessert
beer
oelergud
well
this
is
by
far
the
worst
brew
ive
had
from
dfh
i
feel
cheated
for
shelling
out
12
for
this
bottle
the
fruit
flavor
is
bland
and
subdued
and
the
only
other
flavor
that
really
comes
through
is
the
alcohol
pass
on
this
one
overall
dogfish
head
has
created
a
solid
fruit
beer
but
it
was
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
did
however
try
it
during
a
tasting
that
involved
a
lot
of
great
big
beers
that
may
have
overshadowed
some
of
the
black
blues
more
subtle
qualities
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
and
see
if
any
of
my
opinions
change

at

nice
creation
crafted
with
skill
and
care
from

has
abv
at

a
good
offering
but
ill
not
be
a
repeat
buyer
nice
to
see
something
new
from
dfh
this
seems
like
a
good
beer
but
nothing
really
to
spectacular
hits
me
other
then
the
style
and
mixture
of
ingredients
that
dfh
has
tried
to
induce
into
this
ale
a
one
time
try
will
do
other
then
that
its
perhaps
passable
refreshingly
zippy
enough
and
mildly
fruity
but
just
not
enough
draw
or
character
to
really
perk
interest
beyond
the
cool
name
and
label
overall
this
is
a
neat
experiment
and
an
excellent
beer
to
get
wine
drinkers
interested
it
has
a
lot
of
champagne
qualities
from
the
fizziness
to
the
winelike
flavors
drinkability
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
d
unfortunately
it
is
too
powerful
to
have
much
of
maybe
as
a
dessert
on
a
special
ocassion
overall
a
good
balanced
fruit
beer
just
enough
fruit
to
know
what
you
are
drinking
good
masking
of
alcohol
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
strong
beer
for
summer
i
dont
think
i
could
make
this
a
regular
but
maybe
this
should
be
on
a
rotating
every
other
year
schedule
i
love
the
attempt
but
i
think
it
misses
the
mark
poured

redish
tinted

color
with

tight
white

wonderful
aromas
of
dark
berries
and
some
mild
floral
hops
smooth
and
creamy
taste
of
rich
yet
mild
blackberries
and
blueberries
hops
and
malt
make
a
well
enough
presence
so
that
the
beer
is
not
too
sweet
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
recommended
capped
750ml
bottled
on
021207
pours
a
slightly
pinkish
amber
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
was
mostly
grain
with
just
a
hint
of
berries
and
a
good
whiff
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
on
the
otherhand
was
just
a
mess
it
tasted
sort
of
like
a
bad
berry
wine
there
was
really
not
much
malt
or
hops
at
all
the
drinkability
was
low
due
to
it
being
unbalanced
and
boozy
overall
i
am
very
dissapointed
with
this
brew
as
i
had
such
high
expectations
after
the
red
white
not
reccomended
after
recently
enjoying
the
red
and
white
i
had
big
expectations
for
this
brew
though
nice
it
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
the
beer
pours
a
grapejuice
looking
ruby
color
with
formitable
retention
that
soon
faded
the
abundant
aromas
shows
a
blast
of
juicy
berry
character
with
a
strong
note
of
red
wines
and
oak
the
flavors
show
a
berry
wine
tartness
but
lacks
the
intense
flavors
expected
the
barrel
gives
a
bold
muskiness
and
earthiness
nearly
horse
blanket
which
dominated
the
fresh
fruits
the
feel
ended
up
a
bit
thin
although
hiding
the
alcohols
well
finishes
wiht
a
mild
astringency
and
lambic
quality
nice
but

blueberry
blue
and
black

dominate
the
flavor
as

with

malt
making
for
a
mostly
sweet
beer
with
a
hint
of
sourness
surprsisingly
little
alcohol
present
in
the
flavor
and
while
the

maybe
getting
this
one

whos

subtle

a
medarate
grainy
aroma
to
it
i
can
tell
i
served
this
one
up
too
cold
so
im
going
to
come
back
to
it
in
about
10
minutes
i
can
definitely
pick
up
on
the
berry
content
now
that
its
warmed
a
bit
noticeably
the
blueberry
i
love
fresh
blueberries
one
of
the
reasons
i
had
to
try
this
beer
this
beer
certainly
does
have
an
alcoholic
warmth
to
it
after
a
couple
of
sips
my
stomach
feels
a
touch
warmed
the
berry
flavor
is
subtle
taking
a
back
seat
to
a
malty
grainy
tasting
beer
no
descernable
hop
aroma
or
flavor
to
take
note
of
although
there
is
a
organic
vegetal
quality
to
the
beer
but
not
hops
carbonation
seems
a
bit
subtle
due
to
the
mediumtothick
body
of
the
beer
initially
malty
and
sweet
with
a
faint
tartness
near
the
finish
i
mentioned
that
i
love
blueberries
and
im
just
delighted
that
this
beer
kept
its
flavor
in
check
ive
been
disappointed
with
any
other
blueberry
beer
ive
tried
because
they
always
taste
like
a
jelly
belly
jellybean
or
if
koolaid
made
a
blueberry

sam

but
it
does
kick
in
later
on

is
ok
but
nothing
special
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
to
me
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
no
date
on
the
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
was
a
reddish
hue
with
a
small
head
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
i
couldnt
detect
any
particular
fruit
taste
was
the
same
sweet
but
not
much
else
i
think
after
drinking
the
bottle
that
maybe
i
could
taste
some
backberry
but
im
not
sure
no
hint
of
blueberry
some
malt
gave
it
a
decent
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
too
sweet
for
me
ignored
beer
advocate
glass
suggestion
and
poured
into
a
grolsch
glass
head
levels
out
a
good
two
centimeters
off
the
surface
with
decent
retention
and
delicate
almost
gray
lacing
the
body
is
red
amber
with
purple
tones
bright
red
high
lights
and
some
peachpink
its
moderately
translucent
with
good
clarity
and
tiny
bubbles
the
smell
reminds
me
of
fall
immediately
for
some
reason
maybe
because
i
had
jiahu
and
this
reminds
me
of
that
for
the
first
time
this
fall
but
i
can
not
say
for
sure
i
get
no
absolute
traces
of
raspberry
or
blue
berry
although
i
do
get
strong
hints
of
berry
but
what
specifically
i
cannot
discern
malt
is
present
with
a
weird
dried
corn
note
plus
very
little
hop
aroma
as
it
warms
the
fruit
becomes
much
more
apparent
almost
sticky
in
my
nostrils
taste
is
slightly
gummy
or
jammy
alcohol
is
perceptible
but
by
no
means
over
powering
i
taste
hints
of
fruit
in
the
beginning
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
the
midsection
and
another
flourish
of
berry
character
coupled
with
light
malt
on
the
finish
i
didnt
notice
the
normal
alcohol
warmth
you
would
immediately
after
taking
a
sip
of
something
10
abv
but
it
did
ketch
up
with
my
soon
after
for
me
the
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
unexpected
on
this
i
thought
there
would
be
much
more
residual
sugar
left
over
from
the
fruit
after
fermentation
i
get
the
feeling
the
fruit
had
so
much
fermentable
sugar
in
it
that
it
left
a
smaller
amount
of
desirable
fruit
flavor
and
aroma
but
in
tern
helped
to
boost
the
abv
so
high
very
interesting
definitely
not
a
sessionable
beer
not
because
of
the
drinkable
factor
simply
because
of
the
abv
fun
and
interesting
to
try
but
if
it
were
available
year
round
i
doubt
id
buy
it
it
is
a
rubypurple
red
crystal
clear
beer
with
a
faintly
off
pink
head
the
head
was
huge
but
it
dissapated
quickly
and
only
left
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aromas
are
of
strong
raspberries
black
berries
oak
and
some
phenol
alcohol
but
only
very
faint
phenols
as
the
regular
alcohol
comes
in
strong
flanking
the
beer
like
the
viet
cong
the
taste
is
very
sweet
raspberries
black
berry
fruity
flavors
along
with
the
balance
of
woody
oak
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
back
ground
and
as
it
warms
it
gets
even
stronger
never
the
less
it
doesnt
leave
that
traditional
alcohol
burn
on
you
palette
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
reduction
sauce
for
some
vanila
ice
cream
and
pound
cake
very
nice
once
again
sam
youve
out
done
your
self
great
reddishblue
color
nice
thin
white
head
reminds
me
of
the
one
berlinner
weisse
i
have
had
in
my
life
good
aromafruity
with
a
mellow
lactic
type
smell
to
it
fruity
and
dry
flavor
some
malt
flavor
no
real
bitterness
to
it
good
sourness
the
fruitmalt
dominates
while
the
label
says
blueberries
and
blackberries
neither
stands
outjust
says
fruit
nice
body
for
being
11
overall
a
nice
beer
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
shape
or
form
i
know
they
are
2
seperate
beers
and
styles
but
the
red
and
white
puts
this
away
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
beer
is
not
made
well
i
think
dfh
did
a
good
job
considering
what
it
is
and
i
respect
them
greatly
for
it
i
just
think
perhaps
this
is
one
direction
that
extreme
beer
shouldnt
venture
much
further
this
beer
poured
a
dark
red
color
and
formed
a
pure
white
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
leaving
trace
lace
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
berries
and
not
much
else
present
the
flavor
was
of
blackberries
and
raspberries
with
some
medicinal
aspects
to
it
it
has
a
fairly
light
body
to
it
and
the
finish
was
tart
its
hard
to
review
dogfishs
experitmental
offerings
since
they
always
go
to
the
extreme
which
isnt
necessarily
the
best
wasy
to
approach
a
brew
stay
with
the
red
and
white
dry
astringent
metallicmedicinal
berry
flavors
with
a
strong
robitussin
sensation
that
summons
up
deep
buried
memories
of
the
most
horrible
illnesses
and
almost
makes
me
gag
what
happened
here
red
white
was
phenominal
the
best
large
beer
dfh
has
done
in
while
this
is
a
chore
to
suck
down
and
may
meet
a
watery
grave
in
my
drain
before
long
alcohol
becomes
apparent
a
few
sips
in
with
a
bit
of
hotness
that
goes
straight
to
the
head
im
taken
back
by
the
taste
off
balance
of
berries
black
and
blue
i
assume
the
metallic
hint
is
back
moves
from
thin
to
syrupy
perhaps
i
expect
too
much
from
dfh
but
this
is
not
very
good
a
nice
attempt
though
drinkability
pretty
easygoing
light
flavors
and
body
make
this
a
pretty
refreshing
ale
that
said
the
flavors
arent
prevalent
enough
to
hold
my
interest
for
too
long
it
poured
nicely
developed
a
decent
size
head
and
had
a
nice
purpleruby
color
there
was
little
head
retention
had
a
nice
smell
and
initial
taste
was
good
not
overpowering
on
the
fruit
although
it
did
leave
me
actually
wanting
to
taste
more
of
the
berries
the
mouthfeel
fell
flat
and
left
a
chalky
feeling
on
the
back
of
my
tounge
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
my
high
standards
for
dogfish
left
me
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
this
one
and
it
did
nothing
of
the
sort
it
poured
a
deep
purplereddish
color
with
a
head
that
was
gone
within
seconds
and
like
i
said
before
the
first
few
drinks
were
very
pleasant
very
unimpressive
beer
from
dogfish
head
pours
a
dark
purple
berry
like
color
flavor
and
taste
was
just
so
so
no
better
no
worse
than
any
other
fruit
beer
cmon
sam
show
us
the
love
beer
had
at
gabf
in
denver
so
only
a
small
sample
poured
by
sam
the
man
himself
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
having
a
brewpub
only
beer
on
my
travels
to
rehobeth
beach
but
this
was
not
what
i
wanted
the
premiss
for
this
beer
was
taking
a
belgianlike
recipe
with
a
strain
of
yeast
and
during
primary
fermentation
feeding
blueberries
and
blackberries
everydayto
the
yeast
beasties
man
was
this
a
painfull
thing
like
almost
all
of
their
spirits
bruise
color
no
real
head
smells
like
boozy
berries
tastes
like
bad
berries
wine
yuck
maybe
they
will
be
able
to
turn
this
around
the
next
time
they
make
it
like
they
did
with
fort
its
like
bad
medicine
mixed
with
a
caramelized
concentrated
wine
mix
this
is
worse
than
the
sacramental
wine
that
we
would
taste
when
we
were
alter
boys
blech
only
available
on
tap
at
the
rehoboth
beach
brewpub
location
which
is
a
good
thing
this
is
a
sour
beer
and
not
in
a
good
lambic
way
sour
as
in
an
offtasting
badwine
kind
of
way
black
blue
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
characteristics
of
bad
cheap
wine
actually
it
comes
across
as
not
being
aged
enough
maybe
if
it
was
left
to
sit
for
a
while
it
would
mellow
out
but
as
it
stands
now
this
is
an
offensivetasting
intrusive
beer
the
black
blues
cousin
beer
red
white
was
completely
sold
out
in
under
a
month
whereas
bb
was
still
available
which
should
tell
you
something
overpriced
too
alcoholic
and
difficult
to
finish
avoid
upon
your
first
sniff
of
this
beer
it
is
pretty
evident
that
it
was
brewed
with
a
ton
of
fruit
about
300
lbs
of
fresh
blackberries
and
blueberries
to
be
exact
the
taste
is
spicey
a
bit
tart
and
definitely
led
by
blueberries
and
supported
by
the
blackberries
you
can
also
get
a
touch
of
the
hops
on
the
backend
that
round
out
this
beer
and
a
strong
bit
of
carbonation
running
through
although
the
fruit
and
spice
blend
well
to
form
a
pretty
smooth
not
too
sweet
beer
you
definitely
get
the
high
abv
burn
on
this
one
more
so
than
with
the
dfh
red
white
although
this
beer
is
pretty
extreme
from
the
amount
of
fruit
added
and
the
high
abv
it
is
suprisingly
drinkable
and
smooth
and
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
before
it
runs
out
good
beer
for
gf
folks
an
interesting
little
gf
beer
the
strawberries
are
an
interesting
touch
and
give
it
some
character
where
it
might
otherwise
be
a
bit
boring
not
too
shabby
as
a
dessert
pairing
when
i
read
the
label
i
thought
it
was
a
joke
when
i
tasted
it
i
knew
it
was
it
looks
like
either
a
urine
sample
or
a
glass
of
apple
juice
it
smells
like
liquid
hand
soap
strong
with
strawberries
the
taste
is
well
not
good
i
bought
a
4
pack
split
the
first
bottle
with
friends
at
a
tasting
and
am
now
wondering
how
i
will
get
rid
of
the
other
three
bottles
definitely
has
a
different
taste
not
unpleasant
at
all
if
i
was
gluten
intolerant
this
would
be
a
fine
choice
sweet
merciful
shit
im
almost
impressed
with
how
bad
this
is
sam
and
co
sometimes
when
youre
wondering
if
you
can
make
something
stop
and
consider
if
you
should
then
never
make
tweason
i
never
thought
that
i
would
say
this
about
anything
from
dogfish
head
brewery
this
was
a
bad
purchase
sorry
overcarbonated
strange
aftertaste
just
not
good
couldnt
even
swallow
it
spat
it
out
and
drainpoured
first
gluten
free
beer
not
trying
another
i
typically
dont
like
fruity
tasting
beer
but
this
one
seemed
fine
to
me
it
finished
well
as
opposed
to
other
beers
that
i
have
tried
with
fruit
in
them
interesting
brew
worth
a
try
dont
understand
the
low
ratings
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
surprising
good
taste
hint
of
sweetness
probably
from
strawberries
really
good
fruit
beer
with
a
nice
sour
twang
to
it
refreshing
sorghum
gives
a
slightly
weird
aftertaste
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
good
refreshing
specialty
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
not
sure
but
think
this
may
of
been
a
bad
bottle
i
didnt
notice
a
strawberry
smell
or
tastep
the
taste
bwas
of
mild
tartness
finishing
with
a
bland
tingle
on
the
tounge
will
try
again
and
compare
this
is
not
a
beer
for
people
who
love
ipas
or
drink
beers
every
day
this
is
the
beer
that
your
wife
or
girlfriend
will
actually
enjoy
or
the
beer
that
you
can
serve
to
your
gluten
intolerant
relative
during
the
holidays
it
is
a
full
strawberry
flavor
with
a
honey
sweetness
at
the
end
im
happy
and
appreciative
theyre
being
creative
but
they
should
edit
the
recipe
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
tint
of
red
the
foam
was
very
fizzy
and
did
not
trail
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
strawberries
to
the
point
where
i
couldnt
smell
anything
else
the
taste
was
an
intense
burst
of
tart
from
the
strawberries
which
then
mellowed
out
due
to
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
an
interesting
brew
adding
honey
and
strawberry
to
mix
did
make
the
experience
of
a
sorghum
beer
better
but
its
not
something
i
would
see
myself
getting
as
a
gluten
tolerant
person
the
strawberry
is
more
there
than
belmonts
strawberry
blonde
but
not
overpowering
it
does
leave
a
weird
aftertaste
like
you
ate
a
strawberry
cough
lozenge
this
is
probably
from
the
sorghum
overall
it
does
have
a
bit
of
mediciney
vibe
to
it
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
would
not
drink
it
again
maybe
on
tap
it
would
be
a
different
feel
definitely
stick
with
barely
based
beverages
rather
than
sorghum
creative
beer
but
overall
not
that
tasty
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
beers
fruity
aroma
had
a
mildly
tart
hint
part
of
me
wants
to
session
this
beer
on
a
lake
when
its
hot
out
but
theres
something
slightly
off
about
the
grainyfruity
taste
of
it
and
i
honestly
dont
know
if
i
could
make
it
past
two
golden
copper
color
weak
head
semi
sweet
fruity
aroma
clean
flavor
mild
graininess
sweet
strawberry
jam
light
body
over
carbonated
not
my
thing
but
ok
for
what
it
is
bottle
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
unrefined
grainy
notes
with
light
strawberry
flavours
is
a
weird
mix
and
not
the
most
enticing
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
unrefined
grainy
notes
with
some
light
unsweetened
strawberry
flavours
body
is
light
with
ok
carbonation
body
is
light
with
ok
carbonation
ill
leave
this
one
to
people
that
dont
tolerate
gluten
of
the
glutenfree
beers
that
i
have
subjected
myself
to
recently
it
has
been
the
fruitinfused
ones
that
were
the
most
palatable
an
aggro
pour
produced
a
brief
finger
of
fizzy
pinkishwhite
head
with
minor
retention
color
was
a
yellowgold
srm
45
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
of
green
apples
and
airplane
glue
just
as
earlier
reviewers
had
remarked
ha
ha
at
least
it
is
something
different
mouthfeel
was
thin
watery
and
fizzy
like
soda
water
taste
was
palatable
with
the
strawberry
really
shining
through
that
apple
vinegar
taste
that
is
so
prevalent
in
these
beers
finish
was
semidry
again
thanks
to
the
strawberry
cutting
through
some
of
the
sharper
flavors
to
round
the
edges
i
am
glad
that
i
do
not
have
celiac
but
if
i
did
it
would
have
to
be
the
fruitinfused
beers
that
i
would
turn
to
light
bodied
with
light
fizzy
carbonation
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
not
worth
seeking
out
again
i
do
admire
sam
and
dfh
for
their
breaking
molds
and
pushing
beer
to
its
outer
limits
but
still
the
beer
has
to
taste
good
and
when
i
get
burned
with
beers
that
dont
impress
me
and
usually
cost
more
i
have
to
say
no
o
certainly
a
unique
brew
nothing
really
off
about
it
aside
from
the
complex
green
flavors
perhaps
its
just
that
shock
of
tasting
something
different
it
did
grow
on
me
a
bit
by
the
end
all
in
all
its
one
of
the
better
gluten
free
barley
free
beers
out
there
overall
a
disappointing
entry
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
knew
going
into
this
it
wasnt
going
to
be
the
best
judging
by
its
ratings
ive
had
a
few
gluten
free
beers
and
a
few
made
with
sorghum
and
those
werent
great
but
this
one
disappointing
no
reason
to
try
this
one
poured
from
355
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
9282013
o
not
bad
but
that
aftertaste
i
guess
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
a
neutral
beer
o
i
actually
like
this
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
complex
o
i
thought
i
would
try
it
i
am
glad
i
dont
have
a
gluten
issue
after
this
one
well
for
those
gluten
intolerant
if
this
is
allowed
and
a
leine
summer
shandy
would
be
enjoyable
maybe
this
is
a
good
alternative
if
you
like
just
beer
well
stay
away
light
fresh
with
a
slight
fruit
taste
this
ale
from
dogfish
head
doenst
have
quite
the
wow
of
many
of
their
other
products
however
it
is
quite
drinkable
especially
since
it
has
such
a
light
feel
and
mild
taste
not
bitter
or
hoppy
at
all
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
but
if
someone
offered
me
one
id
take
it
has
a
strong
strawberry
and
honey
taste
but
surprisingly
is
not
sweet
has
a
dry
syrupy
feel
that
reminds
me
of
the
immort
ale
feels
fizzy
on
the
tongue
despite
the
strangeness
it
is
still
enjoyable
though
not
for
everyone
for
me
its
the
strawberry
that
helps
lift
it
overall
this
is
disappointing
lacks
flavor
any
type
of
complex
flavor
or
balance
tastes
like
a
cheap
table
wine
or
some
halfassed
girly
mixed
drink
at
some
yuppy
bar
nothing
id
recommend
or
revisit
again
overall
an
interesting
and
decent
take
on
a
fruit
beer
very
light
but
the
strawberry
taste
is
nice
o
being
a
glutenfree
beer
this
one
is
drinkable
not
my
favorite
mix
of
flavors
but
its
not
overthetop
sweet
to
the
point
of
being
undrinkable
drinks
somewhat
like
a
soda
but
its
nice
to
see
a
noble
attempt
at
a
glutenfree
offering
serving
type
bottle
final
thoughts
im
not
sure
this
beer
was
all
that
fresh
but
its
difficult
to
find
any
flaws
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
glutenfree
is
hardly
brought
up
in
the
flavor
another
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
tweasonally
screaming
with
odoriferous
emanations
of
strawberry
shortcake
tweason
ale
is
an
inviting
entry
into
the
fruitbeer
market
being
gluten
free
is
a
massive
added
bonus
hazy
reddish
amber
with
a
sedentary
head
this
brew
is
quite
tempting
the
nose
has
a
beautiful
essence
of
the
strawberries
within
but
the
malted
nose
gives
it
authenticity
slightly
bitter
and
marginally
sweet
this
beer
satisfies
quite
well
if
you
are
sensitive
to
gluten
this
is
truly
a
wonderful
alternative
to
those
brews
with
similar
attributes
which
are
simply
nonpotable
to
the
celiac
sufferer
kudos
to
dfh
overall
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
one
and
its
a
very
solid
fruit
beer
ive
only
found
a
couple
of
others
that
i
genuinely
like
and
ill
now
add
this
one
to
the
list
nothing
outstanding
thatll
make
me
search
it
out
but
when
im
in
the
mood
and
its
in
my
field
of
vision
i
wont
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
o
this
is
a
nice
beverage
to
drink
my
wife
is
gluten
free
and
why
we
have
it
around
the
house
i
definitely
think
of
this
more
in
a
sparkling
wine
category
vs
a
beer
category
that
being
said
for
what
it
is
it
is
good
in
the
beer
spectrum
its
only
ok
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
those
who
seldom
drink
or
have
an
aversion
to
gluten
very
much
a
warm
weather
beer
that
borders
on
a
cider
with
its
strong
strawberry
flavor
a
must
for
the
glutenfree
o
3
50
this
beer
taste
more
like
wine
than
beer
it
seems
more
like
a
novelty
than
anything
call
me
crazy
trust
me
you
wont
be
the
first
nor
will
you
be
the
last
so
i
dont
care
but
this
is
a
pretty
right
on
fruit
beer
that
is
also
gluten
free
i
mean
if
i
couldnt
have
gluten
i
would
load
up
on
this
brew
its
great
dogfish
did
a
great
job
on
this
one
great
quality
great
taste
and
all
around
pretty
fair
price
for
a
very
good
four
pack
if
i
see
this
again
i
am
liable
to
by
more
without
much
thought
ill
be
enjoying
the
rest
in
the
weeks
to
come
that
is
for
sure
this
ale
is
interesting
the
liquid
is
utterly
clear
with
a
thin
white
head
and
a
stream
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
subtle
but
multifaceted
with
fruit
berries
i
got
strawberry
as
noted
on
the
label
but
i
also
thout
i
smelled
some
raspberries
the
beer
is
semi
dry
with
a
lot
of
fruit
there
is
a
slightly
astringent
grainy
taste
almost
salty
as
well
medium
body
although
not
an
exceptional
beer
this
beer
is
very
engaging
flavor
is
considerably
more
dry
the
honey
tastes
entirely
fermented
out
the
flavor
is
more
floral
mixed
with
strawberry
and
even
though
its
dry
theres
no
particular
hop
character
pretty
good
but
could
just
as
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
dry
flavored
cider
pretty
fizzy
but
not
too
bad
drinkable
if
not
super
exciting
i
am
honestly
not
thinking
about
this
as
beer
but
as
a
glutenfree
beverage
the
problem
is
that
tweasenale
is
trying
to
be
both
a
beer
substitute
for
someone
who
must
avoid
gluten
and
its
also
trying
to
approach
the
problem
through
fruit
and
honey
it
doesnt
make
it
on
either
front
it
has
no
relation
to
a
standard
beer
and
the
fruit
tastes
very
candied
and
artificial
in
the
final
product
while
i
am
a
dogfish
head
fan
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
here
i
would
like
to
see
what
this
beer
tasted
like
without
the
strawberries
they
add
a
bit
that
i
think
might
just
clash
with
the
sorghum
it
would
be
nice
to
see
what
it
is
like
without
it
and
perhaps
with
some
other
fruit
or
just
no
fruit
and
fermented
with
a
different
yeast
strain
or
aged
in
some
kind
of
barrel
to
give
it
some
more
flavor
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
honey
color
not
unlike
an
ipa
the
aroma
is
floral
and
honey
no
noticeable
head
texture
is
watery
with
medium
carbonation
body
is
light
taste
is
definitely
unusual
i
am
not
sure
what
they
are
trying
to
do
here
i
respect
what
the
brewmaster
was
trying
to
do
but
it
seems
like
a
stretch
to
call
it
an
ale
for
now
this
is
not
a
brew
that
i
would
come
back
to
often
o
not
one
of
dogfishs
best
beers
but
to
tackle
the
glutenfree
category
they
make
this
a
solid
effort
for
those
with
sensitivities
to
gluten
this
is
a
good
option
to
try
hats
off
to
the
gluten
free
brewing
you
are
doing
a
great
service
i
had
this
on
tap
over
the
weekend
at
the
brew
pub
in
rehobeth
it
was
fresh
clear
and
had
a
fantastic
taste
the
color
was
good
and
the
smell
showed
the
fruit
added
to
the
batch
id
recommend
it
as
a
great
medium
bodied
beer
for
the
summer
it
wasnt
too
heavy
i
love
everything
dogfish
has
but
this
is
the
worst
beer
by
far
that
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
crap
in
a
bottle
for
50
bucks
a
case
i
not
only
feel
raped
but
robbed
as
well
this
should
be
flushed
down
a
toilet
only
i
fear
that
insects
may
come
across
it
drink
and
be
just
has
disgusted
as
i
was
i
hope
this
beer
burns
in
hell
for
what
it
did
to
my
mouth
overall
i
can
appreciate
the
effort
but
perhaps
strawberry
is
not
meant
to
be
in
an
ale
as
the
sweetness
overpowered
the
rest
of
the
beer
this
brew
is
okay
on
a
hot
day
i
am
drinking
it
on
a
hot
day
right
now
but
there
is
too
much
carbonation
and
not
enough
hops
like
most
fruit
beers
for
me
to
say
that
i
would
like
to
have
this
again
overall
one
of
dogfish
heads
most
refreshing
beers
even
if
it
is
a
bit
odd
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
fruity
scent
that
seems
a
tad
boozy
definitely
lacking
a
malt
base
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
yet
tart
with
an
apple
cider
flavor
it
goes
down
slow
and
easy
with
a
watery
sour
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
nonmalt
beer
with
character
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
more
overall
meh
didnt
have
high
expectations
but
the
wet
cardboard
cork
flavor
really
hurt
the
beer
even
more
if
it
wasnt
for
that
it
would
be
tolerable
but
that
just
ruins
any
possibility
this
beer
had
a
copper
color
when
poured
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
the
beer
had
a
very
light
mouth
feel
the
beer
tasted
like
strawberries
with
hints
of
honey
and
molasses
the
finish
was
tart
and
light
i
liked
that
the
beer
had
a
light
finish
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
stronger
flavor
with
that
being
said
this
beer
is
still
far
more
flavorful
than
other
glutenfree
beers
out
there
pours
an
orangish
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
strawberries
the
taste
starts
with
a
hint
of
strawberry
then
some
musty
sweetness
then
a
tart
light
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
especially
for
6
abv
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
but
decent
enough
tasting
dogfish
head
tweasonale
45
very
poor
drinking
ale
i
would
avoid
it
at
all
costs
not
for
me
this
beer
is
for
wine
converts
pours
a
crystal
clear
reddish
copper
with
a
shortlived
head
aromas
are
amazing
hyper
floral
notes
of
rose
petal
potpourri
grandmas
perfume
and
ripe
strawberries
tastes
is
odd
but
not
unappealing
the
best
i
can
describe
it
is
as
rose
water
with
phenolic
honey
hints
body
is
thin
and
watery
undercarbonated
an
interesting
beer
to
sample
but
not
to
stock
up
on
unless
glutenfree
is
your
game
o
gluten
free
not
that
good
pass
if
you
can
the
wife
wanted
something
light
this
is
all
i
could
offer
sorry
for
a
gluten
free
beer
this
is
quite
powerful
its
almost
like
strawberry
juicewater
strong
and
pungent
and
i
cant
really
get
any
subtle
character
off
of
it
its
a
nice
drinker
and
for
someone
with
a
gluten
allergy
i
would
think
itd
be
nice
but
for
me
its
way
too
strong
o
this
is
a
fair
strawberry
mead
that
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
sorghum
but
it
doesnt
show
up
here
and
there
is
not
much
else
to
taste
overall
i
think
its
my
first
glutenfree
beer
and
thus
its
hard
to
compare
against
others
of
its
kind
however
its
tasty
enough
although
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
o
my
wife
has
celiac
and
while
shes
not
a
beer
fan
in
general
i
got
this
for
her
to
try
overall
i
would
not
drink
this
regularly
but
at
the
same
time
given
the
reputation
of
many
gluten
free
beers
i
figured
if
any
brewery
could
pull
it
off
it
would
be
dfh
and
i
was
right
kudos
for
the
effort
overall
not
a
bad
beer
considering
its
unconventional
ingredients
but
i
would
think
a
beerloving
recently
discovered
celiac
could
find
a
better
beverage
choice
poured
this
fruit
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
clear
reddish
golden
color
produced
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
this
beer
fizzed
like
a
soda
very
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
ale
was
dominated
by
strawberries
and
honey
medium
in
body
since
this
is
a
gluten
free
beer
it
lacks
much
of
any
malted
base
in
fact
it
has
none
but
with
that
said
there
are
flavors
of
citric
oranges
lemons
and
tart
strawberries
thank
god
i
dont
have
an
issue
with
gluten
it
was
nice
to
try
this
brew
but
nothing
that
i
wold
ever
buy
again
if
i
ever
do
decide
to
go
glutenfree
and
i
just
might
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
this
in
the
meantime
ill
stick
to
my
ipas
and
lagers
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
below
average
fruit
beer
since
this
is
the
only
gluten
free
beer
i
have
tried
i
really
cant
compare
it
to
others
in
the
style
it
wasnt
terrible
but
to
me
it
tasted
much
more
like
a
sparkling
fruit
wine
then
a
beer
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
but
the
flavor
couldnt
hold
my
attention
this
might
be
nice
in
the
summertime
but
for
now
one
is
enough
for
me
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
that
bad
and
it
was
the
most
complex
aspect
in
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
similar
to
a
sparkling
fruit
wine
it
tasted
i
think
some
more
hops
would
give
it
more
beer
like
qualitys
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
just
isnt
my
thing
and
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
to
anyone
unless
they
actually
have
a
gluten
allergy
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
style
but
it
ended
up
not
being
for
me
i
think
its
cool
dogfish
head
made
a
beer
for
people
that
normally
cant
drink
a
beer
but
if
your
not
one
of
those
people
it
might
be
best
just
to
avoid
this
beer
all
together
and
be
thankful
you
dont
have
a
gluten
allergy
this
was
a
cool
concept
that
really
didnt
come
together
as
well
as
i
hoped
it
was
good
attempt
but
this
beer
just
isnt
for
me
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
wont
ever
have
it
again
o
overall
a
decent
beer
and
probably
order
again
i
appreciate
dfhs
willingness
to
experiment
but
jeez
you
dont
have
to
bottle
everything
if
i
had
to
live
a
gluten
free
diet
im
looking
for
another
way
to
catch
a
buzz
i
thought
this
beer
was
on
the
discordant
side
very
sweet
but
sour
and
they
didnt
seem
to
agree
with
each
other
im
glad
its
only
a
4
pack
maybe
i
can
get
my
wife
to
try
one
12
ounce
bottle
into
signature
pint
glass
bottled
on
442012
pours
lightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
12
finger
foamy
white
head
with
poor
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
minimal
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
huge
honey
tart
strawberry
apple
cider
pear
light
caramel
light
bread
and
a
touch
of
raspberry
very
nice
aromas
with
good
strength
and
balance
taste
of
honey
strawberry
pear
apple
cider
wheat
floral
herbal
earth
and
light
tart
raspberry
zero
bitterness
with
lingering
notes
of
honey
strawberry
pear
apple
raspberry
and
herbal
on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
good
flavor
balance
with
a
fair
amount
of
flavors
and
decent
complexity
quite
dry
on
the
finish
with
zero
cloying
sweetness
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
syrupy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
gluten
free
sorghum
beer
a
fair
amount
of
nice
flavors
with
decent
balance
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
stuff
if
youre
one
of
those
glutenfree
types
give
this
one
a
whirl
if
youre
a
barley
drinker
give
it
a
whirl
too
for
something
different
o
i
suppose
if
i
really
had
celiac
disease
i
might
turn
to
this
one
every
now
and
then
but
since
i
dont
i
wont
the
flavor
was
somewhere
between
beer
and
strawberry
lambic
but
not
as
good
as
either
honestly
this
was
below
my
expectations
for
dogfish
head
if
you
must
drink
a
glutenfree
brew
might
i
recommend
estrella
damm
daura
for
the
customers
and
mine
own
edification
and
lets
face
it
for
the
sake
of
the
tick
i
felt
i
should
try
this
new
glutenfree
beer
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sourdough
light
maple
syrup
a
twinge
of
stone
fruit
and
a
kiss
of
chamomile
the
taste
continues
the
breads
dominance
though
now
its
clear
this
bread
was
made
without
a
gluten
source
the
sorghum
flavor
being
not
only
distinct
in
its
own
right
but
clearly
on
display
here
this
is
the
major
failing
of
the
majority
of
glutenfree
beers
as
this
nonetootasty
flavor
is
never
properly
masked
theres
a
hint
of
strawberry
here
too
as
advertised
but
its
faint
an
echo
in
the
bready
darkness
a
honeylike
sweetness
pervades
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
glutenfree
options
out
there
but
it
could
use
more
fruit
never
thought
id
say
a
dfh
beer
needed
more
of
its
fruit
component
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
mask
the
sorghum
better
overall
i
dont
remember
it
being
quite
this
bad
the
last
time
i
had
it
but
perhaps
the
temperature
being
thirty
degrees
or
so
lower
is
affecting
my
palette
better
out
of
the
bottle
but
ill
leave
it
alone
next
time
not
quite
a
drainpour
but
far
too
close
nevermind
not
really
worth
finishing
sorry
smell
not
that
good
taste
not
good
mouthfeel
not
good
overall
you
guess
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
light
to
medium
golden
amber
with
a
very
thin
white
bubbly
head
left
really
just
lacings
almost
immediately
after
pouring
aroma
was
slightly
sour
with
noticeable
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
strawberry
in
the
back
end
flavor
reminded
me
a
sweet
slightly
dry
wine
a
small
hint
of
fruity
strawberry
was
hiding
in
the
back
but
was
very
minute
didnt
coat
very
well
in
the
mouth
and
ended
up
with
a
fair
amount
of
bubbles
despite
not
having
any
carbonation
overall
a
bit
on
the
unusual
side
really
reminded
me
more
of
a
wine
than
a
beer
so
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
so
this
is
the
type
of
beer
a
nonbeer
drinker
would
enjoy
not
for
me
i
always
respect
the
dogfish
head
experiments
but
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
and
im
happy
that
im
not
restricted
to
gluten
free
choices
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
the
one
part
of
this
beer
that
i
didnt
like
was
the
hard
to
pinpoint
sour
funky
taste
which
negated
the
nice
strawberry
flavor
o
for
a
gluten
free
fruit
beer
its
really
good
for
a
beer
overall
nothing
fantastic
definitely
a
beer
for
newbies
o
this
beer
wasnt
as
bad
as
some
other
glutenfree
beers
i
have
had
before
and
this
may
be
due
to
the
strawberry
flavors
making
things
a
little
more
palatable
overall
gluten
free
or
not
ive
had
worse
maybe
im
a
sucker
for
a
fruit
beer
but
i
dont
hate
this
its
not
one
ill
be
buying
regularly
by
any
stretch
but
it
isnt
one
id
shun
either
this
has
to
be
rated
in
comparison
to
other
gluten
free
beers
no
gluten
free
beer
is
anywhere
compared
to
ordinary
brews
my
daughter
who
enjoys
a
beer
as
much
as
anyone
found
problems
nagging
her
for
years
were
due
to
gluten
intolerance
that
dogfish
head
waved
its
brewing
wand
and
came
up
with
this
superior
for
gluten
free
beverage
for
people
like
her
deserves
commendation
i
understand
folks
who
may
not
have
tried
other
gluten
free
beers
but
this
is
a
fine
effort
in
that
genre
imagine
you
could
not
drink
your
fav
brew
or
any
usual
beer
again
and
you
might
be
happy

poured
gently
into
an
ommegang
goblet

a
very
brilliant
tangerinelight
maple
hue
transparent
without
sediment
and
a
short
lived
fizzy
white
head
of
1
no
lacing
in
the
glass
the
bouquet
is
of
much
fruit
honey
and
is
there
a
touch
of
buckwheat
in
there
i
didnt
realize
there
was
actually
buckwheat
used
in
the
beer
until
i
checked
the
bottle
apples
strawberries
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
peel
somewhere
in
there
the
flavor
is
sweet
in
the
forefront
with
the
honey
and
sweet
fruit
flavors
shining
first
then
a
train
of
sour
apples
and
strawberries
follow
finishing
with
a
lasting
sour
tail
and
the
slightly
earthy
tone
of
buckwheat
honey
the
grain
profile
is
different
for
sure
but
i
cant
quite
describe
it
just
now
it
tastes
like
theres
a
bit
of
wheat
in
there
but
i
cant
really
tell
what
i
do
know
is
that
its
quite
light
effervescent
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
dogfish
head
tweasonale
is
a
very
lively
and
clear
golden
brew
with
no
head
it
has
a
sweet
and
sour
aroma
with
a
large
dose
of
strawberry
its
super
light
bodied
and
and
very
lively
in
the
mouth
the
finish
is
a
little
chalky
it
tastes
a
little
sweet
and
pretty
sour
it
kind
of
has
a
strawberry
candy
or
strawberry
gum
flavor
going
on
some
herbal
bitterness
comes
in
at
the
finish
but
the
sourness
overpowers
everything
this
seems
like
it
would
be
a
light
easytodrink
affair
but
it
ends
up
being
kind
of
a
challenge
it
has
a
fruity
winelike
nose
of
strawberries
the
smell
is
very
sweet
it
tastes
a
bit
odd
up
front
from
the
sorghum
im
assuming
but
after
that
the
taste
of
honey
is
definitely
dominant
the
beer
itself
isnt
overly
sweet
like
honey
but
the
actual
flavor
of
honey
is
predominate
and
it
sticks
around
in
your
throat
like
you
were
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
with
honey
in
it
surprisingly
i
found
this
offering
from
dfh
really
good
i
was
wary
because
of
the
glutenfree
thing
along
with
a
beer
containing
strawberries
and
honey
but
its
pretty
good
id
drink
it
again
overall
i
dont
get
much
about
this
beer
i
understand
the
glutenfree
angle
but
theres
really
not
much
to
mark
this
as
beer
it
tastes
more
like
a
fruity
sparkling
wine
or
rosé
i
usually
appreciate
dfhs
attempt
to
make
unique
and
strange
beers
but
this
just
tastes
fizzy
and
artificial
i
cant
see
myself
paying
dfh
prices
for
something
like
this
again
o
i
dont
know
what
to
honestly
give
this
i
mean
it
is
dogfish
but
i
think
they
may
have
missed
the
mark
a
bit
on
this
one
an
average
fruitvegetable
beer
at
best
i
wouldnt
lump
this
in
with
beers
or
ales
although
it
has
some
origins
in
that
realm
at
least
it
isnt
too
unbalanced
i
cant
see
drinking
a
second
one
and
do
not
intend
to
buy
this
again
o
this
is
my
first
gluten
free
beer
and
my
first
taste
of
strawberry
in
a
brew
as
well
pretty
good
overall
nothing
that
really
turns
me
off
about
the
beer
a
good
beer
for
chicks
but
not
bad
to
try
or
indulge
once
in
a
while
o
not
very
good
at
all
buy
only
a
single
if
you
must
try
dfh
got
what
they
were
going
for
just
not
a
fan
of
the
strawberry
pours
a
pretty
reddish
pink
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
a
straight
strawberry
and
grainy
aroma
taste
is
too
sweet
and
slightly
sour
fake
strawberries
nothing
else
slightly
watered
down
and
yet
a
bit
syrupy
due
to
the
low
carbonation
no
real
malt
flavor
that
i
can
pick
up
kind
of
like
a
wine
cooler
meh
i
guess
its
good
they
offer
a
gluten
free
option
cheers
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bottled
on
70312
this
pours
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
fuzzy
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
fruity
strawberries
honey
something
a
little
funky
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
bad
im
guessing
its
better
than
other
glutten
free
beers
although
ive
never
tried
another
one
but
this
you
get
a
funky
off
taste
some
strawberry
and
honey
o
very
interesting
beer
i
dont
know
quite
what
to
make
of
it
it
is
very
different
i
cant
get
the
impression
of
red
wine
out
of
mind
it
has
a
distinct
berry
flavor
and
an
assortment
of
other
flavors
my
taste
buds
cannot
place
overall
a
unique
beer
that
missed
the
mark
for
me
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
buy
again
tweasonale
pours
a
light
bodied
strawberry
water
rosish
pink
in
color
with
little
head
but
plenty
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
light
and
pretty
simple
there
is
just
a
touch
of
sweet
and
slowly
tart
strawberry
and
also
a
tonic
water
like
element
to
it
the
flavors
are
fruity
and
sweet
up
front
with
plenty
of
strawberry
water
it
has
a
slight
tartness
as
well
but
has
plenty
of
that
tonic
element
once
again
it
drinks
a
little
watery
with
just
an
artificial
aspect
about
it
for
a
gluten
free
though
its
not
too
bad
its
at
least
different
than
most
other
options
sure
this
was
light
on
the
palate
but
it
was
only
after
i
finished
the
bottle
that
i
could
tell
that
there
was
just
a
bit
of
booze
in
this
i
was
hoping
that
dogfish
head
could
brew
a
beer
of
this
style
that
would
stand
out
from
other
examples
but
if
these
guys
cant
come
up
with
something
that
stands
out
who
can
take
this
for
all
its
worth
which
isnt
much
when
placed
next
to
the
60
or
90
minute
ipa
overall
for
a
fruit
a
beer
this
is
not
bad
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
i
wouldnt
say
no
in
the
furute
to
having
this
again
overall
a
powdery
sweet
strawberry
flavored
experiment
that
only
dogfish
head
could
make
at
least
somewhat
interesting
worth
trying
one
just
to
try
but
if
i
go
fruit
i
much
prefer
their
festina
peche
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
honey
in
it
as
well
as
some
strawberry
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
apple
cider
like
notes
as
well
as
some
strawberry
and
honey
while
all
of
these
notes
can
be
good
in
a
beer
they
dont
go
well
together
in
this
one
the
beer
tastes
messy
and
is
just
not
to
the
usual
level
of
dogfish
head
beers
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
appreciated
dfhs
approach
to
making
unusual
beers
especially
one
like
this
but
this
just
isnt
working
for
me
at
all
overall
every
time
i
try
glutenfree
beer
it
reminds
me
of
soda
the
body
the
carbonation
even
the
bubbles
from
the
very
first
pour
the
head
is
made
up
of
such
big
bubbles
it
looks
like
soda
foam
not
the
thick
creamy
head
associated
with
beer
the
taste
isnt
much
different
the
sorghum
always
reminds
me
of
cream
soda
in
some
weird
way
not
the
sweetness
level
just
very
mildly
vanillin
i
just
cant
get
past
the
lack
of
malt
frankly
i
dont
have
to
either
every
time
i
try
these
its
a
reminder
of
how
good
i
have
it
thank
god
for
beer
a
very
unique
beer
as
mentioned
above
very
easily
distinguished
flavors
enjoyable
bottled
on
date
of
1221
almost
8
months
ago
but
still
tastes
fresh
like
i
had
at
the
brewery
a
couple
weeks
before
strawberry
is
present
from
front
to
back
slightly
sour
style
smells
of
strawberries
and
sugar
good
color
golden
yellow
with
a
hint
of
pink
i
dont
need
gluten
free
but
this
is
a
winner
and
happy
that
it
is
being
made
to
accommodate
hot
summer
days
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
probably
one
of
the
better
glutton
free
options
i
have
tried
but
it
is
not
something
that
i
look
for
when
purchasing
beers
o
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
the
cocktail
set
or
for
the
ladies
and
this
beer
is
undeniably
unique
profiles
in
courage
however
unless
you
seek
out
fruit
beers
i
would
not
recommend
this
and
please
dont
judge
all
of
dogfish
heads
brews
by
this
one
style
o
probably
the
best
sorghumbased
fruit
beer
ive
had
to
date
but
thats
not
saying
much
the
6
abv
and
complexity
of
the
honey
and
strawberries
on
the
palate
did
surprise
me
a
bit
but
this
brews
a
tad
too
far
into
a
niche
outside
my
wheelhouse
kinda
bummed
its
the
in
between
seasonal
brew
dfh
will
come
out
with
4
times
a
year
recommended
for
a
certain
sect
but
not
the
masses
o
interesting
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
for
seconds
but
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
was
one
of
my
least
favorite
dogfish
beers
the
strawberry
flavor
was
good
but
there
was
a
lot
of
syrupy
flavors
that
came
across
fake
and
didnt
leave
a
good
taste
on
my
palate
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
smells
intensely
fruity
and
sweet
lots
of
strawberry
and
grape
but
sort
of
fakesugary
ones
not
much
actual
character
to
it
maybe
some
yeast
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
story
watery
but
intensely
sweet
with
highly
concentrated
and
sweetened
fruit
flavors
lots
of
grape
juice
and
strawberry
a
bit
of
cardboard
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
mediumlight
body
carbonation
is
on
the
lighter
side
as
well
the
flavors
here
arent
bad
but
they
die
out
quickly
and
the
soghum
finish
kind
of
turns
me
off
overall
really
not
a
bad
brew
its
fruit
flavor
is
pretty
good
and
hides
some
of
the
slightly
off
sorghum
flavors
an
interesting
brew
and
actually
one
i
would
have
on
greater
occasion
overall
barely
a
beer
needs
more
gluten
just
kidding
pleasant
enough
but
rather
cheap
tasting
fruit
from
concentrate
out
of
a
tin
can
i
paid
3
for
this
overall
a
beer
that
seemed
interesting
and
i
felt
like
i
had
to
try
it
but
now
im
somewhat
regretting
that
fact
i
mean
the
beer
isnt
entirely
bad
but
im
not
sure
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
to
expand
their
beer
horizon
i
did
not
enjoy
it
i
am
probably
not
going
to
finish
it
weird
flavors
and
smell
for
a
beer
pours
a
onefinger
white
head
that
vanishes
leaving
no
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
light
strawberry
nose
and
flavor
is
fruity
medicinal
and
some
sorghum
expensive
at
3
20
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
overall
if
i
had
a
gluten
allergy
id
probably
enjoy
the
fact
that
this
exists
luckily
its
back
to
barley
for
me
the
phenolic
notes
which
may
just
be
what
i
perceive
from
sorghum
are
overwhelming
and
theres
not
much
else
redeeming
here
overall
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
its
not
as
light
and
sickly
as
i
feared
one
bottle
of
this
is
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
pick
up
another
one
right
away
o
doesnt
really
do
much
that
other
fruit
beers
do
other
fruit
beers
also
do
it
better
really
happy
i
didnt
get
a
four
pack
of
this
because
im
happy
to
tick
it
but
likely
wont
buy
it
again
medium
body
and
effervescence
slight
warming
decent
but
just
lipstick
aftertaste
overall
it
is
a
sorghum
beer
and
they
all
suck
best
sorghum
beer
out
there
still
not
good
though
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
it
makes
since
to
put
these
in
a
4
pack
and
not
6
pack
but
i
would
pick
up
a
single
just
to
try
i
didnt
think
that
this
was
bad
at
all
the
strawberries
gave
this
a
nice
refreshing
flavor
and
this
overall
had
a
bit
of
a
dry
cider
thing
going
on
with
it
its
not
super
memorable
but
i
have
to
give
dogfish
credit
for
adding
something
new
to
the
glutenfree
beer
market
o
honestly
one
of
the
best
glutenfree
beers
ive
tried
but
that
being
said
certainly
not
something
id
buy
on
a
regular
basis
md
lively
effervescent
on
the
tongue
thin
body
candy
like
sweetness
will
turn
off
some
and
if
you
want
hops
at
any
level
look
elsewhere
kudos
to
dfh
for
branching
out
and
im
sure
gf
people
will
appreciate
it
o
overall
ive
never
had
a
gluten
free
beer
so
i
dont
know
whats
out
there
what
i
do
know
is
that
this
beer
carries
a
nice
strawberry
flavor
but
the
body
is
fizzy
and
seltzer
like
and
im
no
fan
of
seltzer
not
sure
what
gluten
free
beers
are
like
but
compared
to
nongluten
free
pretty
meh
i
used
to
think
that
a
ticker
has
to
tick
but
maybe
a
ticker
doesnt
really
have
to
tick
not
bad
not
bad
d
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
beer
with
some
good
flavor
especially
considering
it
is
gluten
free
i
like
the
strawberry
flavor
o
hmm
i
think
im
going
to
need
to
give
this
beer
some
time
the
sorghum
has
a
different
flavor
than
your
traditional
malt
it
doesnt
reach
the
caramelly
or
bready
depths
it
sticks
to
that
unprocessed
grain
flavor
which
can
be
good
but
you
really
need
just
a
bit
more
complexity
all
in
all
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
on
my
own
o
pretty
interesting
a
strawberry
ale
with
hints
of
other
things
overall
pretty
good
a
nice
and
easy
summer
ale
o
i
dont
have
much
standard
for
comparison
with
gluten
free
beers
but
i
do
not
much
like
this
beer
maybe
its
good
for
people
with
crohns
but
thats
about
it
o
overall
an
ok
beer
although
i
prefer
an
ordinary
beer
brewed
with
malts
over
this
one
my
first
gluten
free
beer
pours
a
pink
hued
golden
with
very
little
white
head
sweet
aroma
of
strawberry
honey
and
a
touch
of
grain
fortunately
not
a
thick
aroma
because
that
would
have
killed
it
flavor
starts
off
sweet
strawberry
but
that
dies
out
leaving
a
touch
of
graininess
in
the
finish
a
think
not
too
active
moutfeel
overall
not
bad
if
i
couldnt
drink
beer
i
could
certainly
drink
this
one
on
occassion
though
the
sweetness
is
not
quite
to
my
personal
tastes
but
really
better
than
i
expected
o
i
cant
recall
having
had
another
sorghum
based
gluten
free
beer
so
comparing
this
to
another
instyle
is
tough
on
its
own
though
and
knowing
the
beers
limitations
its
actually
ok
no
ill
not
be
reaching
for
this
but
those
with
celiacs
can
rest
assured
that
sam
and
the
dogfish
crew
have
crafted
a
rather
decent
replacement
to
a
stanard
craft
beer
this
is
definitely
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
which
was
worth
a
try
okinda
hard
to
rate
because
its
very
different
from
any
other
beer
i
have
had
and
i
havent
had
any
other
gluten
free
beers
overall
i
liked
it
but
its
definitely
in
a
class
of
its
own
i
generally
shy
away
from
gluten
free
beers
but
i
will
always
buy
them
for
my
wife
when
i
heard
dfh
was
putting
one
out
i
bought
it
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
its
oddly
flavored
the
strawberry
tries
to
add
something
to
nothing
but
it
doesnt
balance
well
my
wife
and
i
agree
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
o
not
liking
this
one
at
all
ill
pass
on
this
one
for
sure
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
strictly
strawberry
the
taste
is
sweet
of
strawberries
with
a
white
wine
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
with
a
very
dry
finish
almost
like
drinking
strawberry
flavored
champagne
defently
not
one
of
my
favorits
but
if
i
gluten
intolerante
i
would
drink
it
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
ok
beer
compared
to
other
beers
but
a
very
good
one
compared
to
other
sorghum
beers
ive
tried
it
felt
a
little
overly
sweet
and
fruity
for
me
but
id
buy
it
again
if
i
had
to
drink
sorghum
beers
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
coloring
for
a
specialty
beer
the
color
was
a
beautiful
solid
gold
as
far
as
flavoring
we
wish
that
the
strawberries
were
better
integrated
and
hit
the
palate
sooner
than
the
finish
what
was
really
overwhelming
was
all
of
the
winelike
components
with
grape
flavoring
dominating
the
fruit
department
while
this
is
not
something
we
would
routinely
buy
we
can
see
how
it
would
be
a
great
window
into
craft
beer
for
all
people
seeking
gluten
free
beer
a
and
props
for
the
consideration
and
effort
dfh
overall
not
a
very
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
enjoy
strawberries
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
isnt
very
good
overall
grab
it
when
you
see
it
especially
if
it
warm
outside
salud
d
an
interesting
beer
its
nice
to
see
a
brewer
try
to
address
a
whole
in
the
market
gluten
free
craft
beer
im
not
sure
the
end
result
is
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
and
that
i
can
recommend
to
anyone
other
than
someone
looking
for
a
gluten
free
offering
o
it
drinks
ok
but
if
im
going
for
a
fruit
beer
its
not
gonna
be
this
one
not
a
big
fan
of
the
finish
or
the
scent
and
really
didnt
find
much
of
the
strawberry
notes
which
i
had
really
been
hoping
would
be
the
brightest
note
pours
a
typical
but
appealing
clear
amber
with
a
thin
and
not
very
persistent
white
head
strong
fruity
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
strawberry
i
love
strawberries
taste
is
crisp
a
little
malty
mainly
strawberry
almost
like
what
a
strawberry
cider
would
taste
like
a
strawberry
cider
is
that
possible
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
has
an
undertone
of
must
be
buckwheat
texture
is
crisp
and
smooth
a
bit
thin
and
only
slightly
fizzy
but
this
is
still
a
satisfying
drink
one
of
these
days
somebody
will
brew
a
really
great
glutenfree
beer
pours
a
bright
and
glimmering
gold
with
light
bubbling
moderate
cap
of
froth
gone
quickly
scent
brings
tart
strawberry
light
honey
and
a
faint
faint
touch
of
mint
before
the
entire
experience
begins
to
go
down
hill
pleasant
scent
notes
end
with
a
strange
earth
herbal
metallic
note
first
sip
brings
über
tart
strawberry
purée
before
a
strong
herbal
taste
comes
through
moves
into
a
faint
splash
of
honey
and
soy
and
sorghum
notes
earthy
with
sharp
metallic
note
wine
like
taste
and
acidity
just
odd
medium
bodied
slightly
low
on
bubbles
overall
the
strawberry
and
honey
notes
are
the
most
redeeming
qualities
but
the
overall
ingredient
profile
never
blends
well
i
do
offer
respect
for
the
intent
of
the
beer
drink
its
for
some
people
not
for
some
people
i
happen
to
be
one
that
its
not
for
i
dislike
this
less
overtime
swirling
out
the
carbonation
helps
out
a
lot
on
that
front
all
told
this
could
be
a
lot
worse
o
another
good
experimentationconcept
beer
that
just
doesnt
have
that
wow
factor
making
me
want
more
wow
this
is
definitely
a
different
beer
and
im
actually
glad
i
tried
it
because
i
like
it
for
a
beer
with
no
malt
this
is
excellent
the
body
is
bulked
up
by
the
honey
and
it
also
adds
some
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
sour
and
tangy
qualities
this
beer
produces
this
is
definitely
not
for
the
typical
beer
drinkers
and
definitely
for
the
more
open
minded
beer
drinkers
overall
as
with
most
gluten
free
beers
i
have
had
it
just
doesnt
hit
the
mark
as
a
refreshing
beer
as
the
dryness
is
just
a
bit
too
much
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
raspberry
strawberry
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
strawberry
cherry
sugar
and
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
wow
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
high
abv
wine
cooler
on
this
one
with
all
of
the
fruitiness
going
on
granted
this
was
a
little
bit
better
than
a
wine
cooler
as
it
was
more
sweet
obviously
and
didnt
taste
like
ass
i
could
definitely
see
this
one
being
a
good
choice
for
that
girl
that
you
really
like
but
she
wont
put
out
unless
she
is
drunk
give
her
a
few
of
these
and
she
will
be
putty
in
your
hands
you
should
at
least
try
one
though
to
say
you
did
drinkability
in
the
sometimes
hitormiss
world
of
dfh
theres
bound
to
be
a
few
misses
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
but
ill
enjoy
the
last
bottle
on
a
nice
warm
afternoon
i
love
dfh
but
man
i
hope
they
dont
bottle
this
stuff
again
i
appreciate
them
trying
sometihng
different
thats
what
theyre
all
about
but
damn
this
is
a
darker
golden
color
with
mild
carbonation
smells
are
filled
with
sweet
strawberries
the
taste
isnt
as
pleasant
as
the
smell
still
with
some
strawberry
flavor
but
mixed
with
some
acidic
winetype
flavors
this
has
a
lot
in
common
flavorwise
with
some
of
fruitflavored
malt
beverages
or
wine
coolers
pretty
different
for
a
beer
o
a
big
disappointment
i
often
find
fruitveg
beers
to
be
too
heavy
on
the
fruit
but
this
one
was
the
opposite
the
strawberry
really
wasnt
there
in
the
palate
and
this
was
just
sugarhoney
water
it
is
nice
that
dfh
is
taking
a
shot
at
gluten
free
most
gluten
free
is
not
very
good
i
feel
like
gluten
free
beer
is
a
message
to
move
on
to
wine
tweason
is
a
good
time
but
there
is
still
a
ways
to
go
until
it
could
compete
with
the
90
minute
thank
you
dfh
d
not
sure
i
could
get
through
a
second
bottle
considering
the
acidic
quality
is
the
primary
focus
enjoyed
the
dry
and
effervescent
champagne
qualities
in
the
end
though
flavour
complexity
isnt
quite
up
there
with
other
fruit
beers
tweason
ale
is
not
very
good
beer
i
understand
that
its
gluten
free
and
i
applaud
the
efforts
to
craft
such
a
product
however
it
just
doesnt
taste
very
good
one
side
note
i
love
the
inclusion
of
nutrition
facts
on
the
label
this
needs
to
happen
much
more
frequently
as
for
the
beer
it
needs
work
a
lot
actually
pours
an
coppery
orange
hue
with
a
small
short
lived
white
head
aroma
of
berries
strawberries
some
honey
taste
is
a
combination
of
sweet
berries
predominantly
strawberry
with
a
kind
of
nutty
dry
weird
bitter
taste
palate
is
light
crisp
body
with
mild
soda
like
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
berries
ending
is
a
rather
weird
and
unpleasant
combination
of
flavors
i
did
not
like
this
at
all
could
not
finish
drinking
the
whole
bottle
overall
i
would
pass
on
this
perfectly
transparent
light
amber
color
with
a
short
eggshell
white
head
pale
malts
molasses
scotch
and
smoke
with
hints
of
strawberries
black
currants
and
honey
the
aroma
is
complex
and
like
most
dfh
brews
almost
smells
like
a
mismatched
group
of
scrap
ingredients
which
is
not
necessarily
an
awful
thing
initial
sip
is
full
of
strawberry
and
over
carbonation
almost
like
a
flat
99
cent
soda
from
store24
flavor
rolls
into
a
slightly
more
complex
body
with
the
hints
of
honey
molasses
and
dry
scotch
making
their
way
through
highly
carbonated
light
bodied
with
a
dry
pale
finish
quite
disappointed
with
this
one
coming
from
a
big
dfh
fan
in
my
opinion
this
might
qualify
as
their
worst
the
body
is
super
light
and
the
carbonation
is
what
it
should
be
overall
im
kind
of
impressed
i
went
into
this
one
expecting
to
pour
it
out
but
its
solid
im
sure
it
will
make
a
lot
of
people
who
cant
have
gluten
pretty
happy
i
am
very
impressed
and
expect
this
to
be
a
much
better
beer
than
redbridge
or
bards
it
almost
tastes
like
a
real
beer
o
im
glad
that
i
only
bought
a
bottle
of
this
to
try
all
i
can
say
is
i
now
truly
empathize
with
those
that
must
stay
on
a
gluten
free
diet
be
it
choice
or
not
for
those
that
can
enjoy
glutens
your
tastebuds
will
thank
you
for
going
elsewhere
o
wow
this
is
different
from
anything
ive
ever
tried
before
if
i
had
been
blindfolded
and
told
i
was
drinking
a
dry
strawberry
white
wine
or
a
dry
vermouth
it
would
make
more
sense
but
as
a
beer
it
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
for
the
rest
of
this
glass
i
will
pretend
im
sipping
a
strawberry
martini
now
if
only
the
abv
matched
o
glad
i
didnt
waste
money
on
this
ontap
at
dogfish
head
in
rehoboth
a
few
weeks
ago
it
probably
would
have
ruined
my
evening
ah
its
immediately
clear
this
is
a
sorghum
beer
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
strawberry
charactertough
to
create
in
a
beer
but
the
flavor
has
just
a
hit
of
the
fruit
upfront
before
the
more
unpleasant
almost
acidic
grain
sweetness
kicks
in
my
advice
if
you
have
a
gluten
intolerance
drink
this
cold
its
easily
one
of
the
better
glutenfree
beers
ive
had
but
no
match
for
a
normal
wheat
and
barley
brew
overall
this
is
a
departure
from
beer
as
we
know
it
but
i
think
it
tastes
good
nonetheless
big
props
to
aaron
for
tracking
this
one
down
for
us
thanks
man
o
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
a
little
different
than
the
rest
and
you
can
tell
it
has
a
bit
of
quality
to
it
overall
i
am
not
impressed
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
the
flavors
arent
very
good
not
a
good
effort
from
dfh
oi
like
the
gluten
free
idea
i
like
the
nutritional
facts
wouldnt
mind
seeing
nutritional
facts
on
other
beers
however
this
beer
falls
flat
o
overall
it
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
great
either
it
feels
a
touch
watery
and
one
note
although
that
one
note
is
a
pretty
interesting
one
if
you
have
celiac
disease
i
recommend
to
skip
this
offering
i
have
not
tried
other
gluten
free
beers
i
will
continue
to
jump
at
the
chance
to
try
dogfishs
beers
definitely
a
unique
entry
into
the
glutenfree
category
where
all
to
many
attempt
a
beery
taste
and
fall
short
this
is
something
different
for
those
with
celiacs
o
i
have
to
give
credit
to
dfh
for
trying
something
different
in
the
glutenfree
space
i
have
never
understood
why
so
many
brewers
try
to
create
a
sorghumbased
pilsner
or
helles
when
other
beer
styles
are
much
better
suited
to
sorghum
and
millet
o
overall
it
tastes
like
a
novice
extract
homebrew
with
some
fruit
in
it
on
the
positive
its
gluten
free
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
overall
the
more
glutenfree
beers
i
try
the
more
deeply
i
sympathize
with
the
plight
of
those
with
celiac
disease
o
definitely
was
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
considering
strawberries
are
like
my
favorite
fruit
too
oh
well
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
an
almost
soda
pop
style
flavor
im
not
crazy
about
this
but
give
an
extra
nod
to
dfh
for
continuing
to
push
the
envelope
by
trying
new
and
different
combinations
of
flavors
fails
in
the
flavor
its
as
if
a
strawberry
crush
soda
was
watered
down
just
a
tad
not
one
id
go
back
to
but
not
one
to
despise
either
a
decent
alternative
for
those
with
celiac
disease
andor
gluten
allergies
as
for
the
healthconscious
beer
drinker
i
say
eat
well
and
exercise
dont
sacrifice
your
beer
choices
o
the
strawberry
flavors
are
very
nice
and
do
not
come
off
artificial
i
personally
would
not
buy
this
again
pours
a
nice
light
orange
color
not
much
head
on
this
beer
and
it
dissipated
pretty
quickly
other
than
that
the
smell
has
a
slight
hint
of
strawberries
and
honey
i
was
expecting
those
scents
to
pop
a
little
more
but
over
all
its
very
pleasant
the
flavor
is
strawberry
in
the
front
with
honey
adding
the
sweetness
behind
it
its
not
a
strawberry
flavor
that
comes
out
and
grabs
your
attention
but
its
not
hidden
either
very
good
balance
here
im
really
not
a
fan
of
this
type
of
brew
but
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
great
job
from
dogfish
head
on
this
one
its
a
really
refreshing
beer
but
the
grains
really
leave
a
mark
on
the
tongue
at
the
end
but
thats
my
biggest
knock
on
this
one
not
a
bad
thing
o
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
make
gluten
free
make
it
interesting
much
better
second
time
around
tastestrawberries
and
apple
cider
vinagar
very
tart
and
sour
would
be
refreshing
as
a
hot
weather
beer
o
this
doesnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
goers
down
easy
and
all
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
great
there
is
just
sort
of
an
unenjoyable
flavor
and
i
think
it
is
just
missing
that
nice
maltiness
that
really
would
have
boosted
this
beer
in
every
category
overall
it
is
an
interesting
beer
that
im
sure
some
people
will
enjoy
but
it
just
isnt
for
me
i
think
it
is
worth
trying
out
though
cheers
hard
to
describe
but
its
kind
of
like
a
fruit
soda
beer
or
something
overall
i
dont
care
for
it
weird
chemically
fruits
with
lots
of
off
notes
ive
had
pops
that
taste
more
naturally
fruity
o
a
decent
fruit
beer
a
little
sweet
for
my
likings
but
not
bad
for
once
im
not
super
impressed
by
a
dfh
brew
and
for
those
of
you
who
say
all
they
do
is
hop
like
madmen
here
is
your
proof
thats
not
always
the
case
this
one
pours
a
pinkesh
hue
of
yellow
with
an
average
off
white
head
smell
is
fruity
and
tart
definitely
spring
like
aroma
flavor
is
the
essence
of
strawberry
without
being
sweet
i
respect
that
however
we
are
missing
some
gluten
here
sorghum
just
doesnt
malt
right
and
its
too
visible
here
feel
is
fine
whitewinelike
in
feel
acidic
and
dry
im
not
at
all
into
this
one
and
i
am
glad
i
got
a
single
nothing
redeemable
here
just
a
fruity
weird
drink
this
one
might
do
well
for
the
ladies
but
it
aint
no
90minute
for
those
of
us
in
the
know
o
for
a
fruit
beer
its
ok
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
but
i
suppose
its
nice
for
a
change
form
hop
bombs
which
ive
been
on
a
kick
of
lately
o
overall
a
pretty
average
light
beer
but
better
then
redbridge
probably
the
most
available
gluten
free
beer
some
light
strawberry
in
the
nose
and
even
more
in
the
taste
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
would
recommend
it
to
my
friend
with
a
gluten
alergy
i
expected
better
from
this
beer
after
the
talk
of
being
the
best
gluten
free
beer
out
there
i
am
not
sure
i
would
claim
this
if
i
was
dogfishhead
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
not
a
great
beer
either
it
was
enjoyable
and
went
down
easy
i
would
never
pick
this
up
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
with
the
rise
in
requests
for
glutenfree
beers
im
pleased
that
dogfish
head
has
entered
the
arena
with
this
clever
and
characterful
version
but
like
all
other
sorghumheavy
substitutes
the
beers
malt
richness
is
severely
lacking
and
not
a
great
substitute
for
barleyrich
beers
mouthfeel
is
very
light
its
in
down
and
gone
before
you
know
it
so
some
of
the
flavors
took
some
searching
not
a
bad
take
on
a
glutenfree
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
more
maybe
would
pair
well
with
an
even
more
exotic
dish
gotta
give
them
credit
for
giving
the
gluten
free
crowd
some
different
o
for
a
gluten
free
beer
i
was
impressed
but
i
think
the
bar
needs
to
be
regular
beer
and
i
have
faith
that
dogfish
and
others
will
get
there
so
im
judging
it
just
like
any
other
beer
overall
tweasonale
is
another
one
of
those
dogfish
ales
that
while
i
respect
the
process
behind
the
beer
the
final
product
just
doesnt
do
it
to
me
too
tart
too
winelike
still
its
quite
drinkable
reasonably
priced
and
worth
trying
overall
this
beer
has
everything
going
against
it
a
fruit
beer
made
with
strawberry
a
glutenfree
sorghum
beer
however
it
manages
to
do
well
with
its
limitations
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
for
a
glutenfree
strawberry
beer
its
pretty
damn
tasty
judging
it
within
its
limits
it
is
a
damn
fine
beer
poured
into
a
black
raven
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
amber
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
honey
peaches
and
strawberry
taste
is
very
dry
dominated
by
strawberries
finish
very
estery
and
tastes
artificial
bitter
an
unfortunate
light
plastic
flavor
with
the
strawberry
in
the
finish
light
bodied
this
was
a
rare
dogfish
head
miss
for
me
glad
im
not
gluten
intolerant
overall
a
very
crisp
winy
beer
its
the
best
sorghum
beer
ive
had
and
compares
favorably
to
dfh
midas
touch
an
accomplishment
considering
no
barleyone
more
reason
to
respect
dfh
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
ruby
red
minimal
lacy
head
that
is
lost
rather
quickly
very
interesting
aroma
rich
in
an
earthy
honey
very
natural
without
a
lot
of
sweetness
quite
a
complex
flavor
very
sweet
right
off
the
bat
filled
with
honey
and
strawberry
but
that
doesnt
last
long
at
all
it
melds
into
a
sour
earthyness
that
fades
away
rather
quickly
it
doesnt
last
long
on
the
tongue
and
leaves
you
feeling
kind
of
refreshed
at
the
end
odbought
only
a
single
this
as
a
fourpack
runs
around
ten
dollars
not
even
close
to
worth
it
for
me
strange
beer
me
no
likey
the
taste
is
of
strawberries
with
no
alcohol
smell
or
taste
the
aftertaste
sticks
with
you
for
a
while
i
really
kind
of
like
this
beer
it
goes
down
like
water
and
you
can
drink
it
really
fast
but
very
weird
im
not
though
so
its
just
a
good
fruit
beer
its
got
nice
tart
strawberries
tempered
a
bit
by
the
honey
the
late
taste
is
this
beers
highlight
as
it
goes
down
initially
theres
just
a
strange
sort
of
sweetness
that
id
like
to
attribute
to
the
sorghum
even
though
im
not
really
sure
how
it
actually
tastes
then
the
tartness
of
the
strawberries
rushes
in
and
keeps
things
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
chalky
but
is
otherwise
wellcarbonated
and
drying
the
drinkability
is
very
good
6
isnt
a
high
abv
by
any
means
but
it
hides
any
hint
really
that
this
is
alcoholic
at
all
overall
a
very
interesting
and
good
tasting
beer
i
might
go
back
and
pick
up
a
sixpack
with
the
warmer
weather
were
having
in
florida
right
now
im
sure
ill
get
one
during
the
spring
and
summer
releases
o
a
decent
beer
to
try
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
there
best
part
was
seeing
the
nutrition
facts
on
the
label
a
good
choice
for
the
glutenfree
consumer
it
does
take
some
getting
used
to
though
had
to
pickup
a
brand
new
dfh
beer
when
i
saw
it
in
the
store
that
being
said
fruitflavored
beer
is
not
usually
my
thing
it
pours
with
a
loudly
carbonated
head
which
quickly
dissipates
like
that
of
a
soda
smell
is
pretty
good
fruity
slightly
boozy
tastes
lightly
like
strawberries
and
honey
not
bad
very
light
and
refreshing
c
this
is
overall
a
great
beer
if
you
think
fruit
in
beer
is
for
wussies
not
for
you
personally
not
my
everyday
ale
but
a
great
taste
of
dfh
for
someone
who
cant
have
gluten
o
so
it
doesnt
taste
terrible
but
its
hard
to
rate
this
as
a
beer
its
more
like
a
desert
wine
it
is
a
refreshing
beverage
its
very
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
for
a
glutenfree
beer
it
isnt
too
bad
overall
the
first
dogfish
head
beer
i
ever
drained
poured
i
have
only
had
lakefronts
gluten
free
beer
and
it
was
at
least
drinkable
but
this
one
is
way
too
dry
and
tart
nutrition
facts
are
shocking
since
this
beer
is
no
way
worth
170
calories
pours
a
fairlyclear
golden
color
with
a
short
white
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
some
strawberry
and
a
bit
of
an
odd
character
that
i
cant
quite
place
nonetheless
not
terribly
enjoyable
the
flavor
follows
down
the
same
path
theres
some
spice
and
fruit
and
nothing
really
comes
together
light
body
not
a
big
fan
o
so
i
found
this
to
be
a
hard
brew
to
rate
it
has
some
positives
and
some
negatives
to
it
given
the
fact
that
it
was
designed
to
be
glutenfree
i
will
cut
it
some
slack
here
obviously
it
would
be
a
better
beer
if
it
was
made
out
of
wheat
theres
a
reason
that
sorghum
isnt
a
common
ingredient
in
beer
however
this
ale
was
designed
for
those
who
cant
have
wheat
and
for
them
i
can
recommend
this
beer
additionally
people
who
like
fruity
beers
will
enjoy
as
well
for
me
i
dont
know
if
i
will
revisit
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
mind
another
because
it
was
brewed
as
fruit
beer
i
will
rate
it
with
a
4
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
this
will
be
my
last
indulgence
in
this
style
of
brew
if
you
like
fruitvegetable
brews
and
dont
mind
the
thin
carbonated
mouthfeel
you
will
like
this
one
o
not
a
great
brew
the
strawberry
doesnt
carry
well
and
the
beer
itself
is
half
baked
more
than
half
way
way
through
i
think
this
will
be
a
summer
beer
the
stank
has
calmed
a
bit
a
though
not
my
favorite
taste
its
not
bad
overall
its
the
best
gluten
free
sorghum
beer
ive
had
tart
berries
are
nice
but
missing
a
sweet
balance
probably
a
nice
summer
beer
but
a
little
off
for
me
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
too
much
the
alcohol
presence
became
too
overwhelming
to
taste
anything
else
it
sort
of
became
ethyl
alcohol
and
soda
water
d
not
great
even
for
a
gluten
free
beer
the
honey
and
fruit
just
come
across
like
apple
juice
and
cheap
grape
juice
i
see
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
and
it
does
at
least
keep
the
beer
from
seeming
overly
thin
but
it
isnt
very
enjoyable
in
the
end
even
if
i
was
gluten
intolerant
i
wouldnt
drink
this
this
beer
definitely
leans
toward
cidery
which
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
simply
because
it
has
no
barley
or
wheat
its
a
good
substitute
for
those
who
have
issues
with
gluten
and
want
to
be
reminded
of
beer
but
it
has
some
strong
ciderlike
qualities
that
are
somewhat
detrimental
to
the
ale
in
the
title
but
that
is
of
course
what
the
brewery
was
going
for
here
and
this
is
the
best
of
three
gluten
free
beers
ive
tried
it
has
some
really
nice
flavors
as
the
strawberry
takes
a
lot
of
the
focus
away
from
the
lack
of
body
at
least
dfh
never
halfasses
anything
i
would
recommend
this
to
those
with
gluten
allergies
for
sure
i
however
probably
wont
buy
it
again
definitely
worth
the
try
though
o
i
dont
know
why
i
keep
trying
new
beers
from
dfh
i
respect
them
as
a
brewery
and
i
respect
sam
for
what
he
does
a
lot
of
people
love
their
beers
and
they
are
great
advocates
for
the
craft
beer
movement
however
i
have
been
disappointed
with
almost
every
one
of
their
more
unique
offerings
ive
passed
on
most
lately
since
im
tired
of
wasting
money
on
a
750ml
bottle
of
grossness
this
small
12oz
bottle
sucked
me
in
and
reminded
me
why
i
generally
steer
clear
only
buy
this
beer
if
you
cannot
handle
gluten
or
love
super
sweet
syrupy
drinks
oat
first
i
thought
it
tasted
weird
but
then
as
i
had
a
few
more
sips
i
started
to
enjoy
it
but
as
i
got
about
halfway
through
the
glass
i
really
started
to
hate
it
its
just
an
odd
beer
i
feel
like
people
are
gluten
intolerant
probably
want
a
gluten
free
beer
that
reminds
them
of
beer
not
some
weird
concoction
dfh
shouldve
tried
mimicking
the
taste
of
barley
or
wheat
instead
of
tart
berries
t
this
is
my
first
gluten
free
beer
and
im
actually
pretty
impressed
something
about
it
tastes
a
bit
off
but
not
in
a
way
that
totally
turns
me
off
some
tart
strawberries
and
lemons
as
well
as
some
pink
grapefruit
flesh
mouthfeel
reminds
me
more
of
a
cider
than
a
beer
but
its
a
pretty
tasty
beer
nonetheless
o
certainly
the
best
sorghumbased
beer
ive
had
although
i
havent
had
that
many
that
can
be
attributed
to
the
sweetness
of
the
strawberries
and
honey
for
the
most
part
nice
job
by
sam
and
dfh
to
try
to
make
something
that
tastes
better
than
pure
sorghum
in
a
glutenfree
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
sorgum
beer
its
jsut
hard
for
me
to
get
into
these
the
after
taste
always
kills
it
for
me
still
though
this
is
better
than
other
gluton
free
beers
ive
had
12
oz
bottle
from
olive
tree
in
ob
upon
first
sip
dry
white
wine
is
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
a
bit
of
berry
and
light
honey
a
bit
tart
but
finishes
very
clean
a
very
bubbly
brew
that
also
has
a
slight
syrupy
feeling
not
as
sweet
as
the
label
would
lead
you
to
believe
but
pretty
refreshing
seems
like
it
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
to
have
after
doing
some
yard
work
overall
this
is
by
far
the
worst
dfh
beer
ive
ever
had
but
thats
kinda
like
saying
this
onehundred
dollar
bill
is
diirty
its
a
good
beer
worth
trying
but
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
o
this
beer
really
surprised
me
and
i
am
enjoying
it
more
and
more
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
i
feel
that
dfh
did
a
good
job
with
this
pours
an
orange
ale
with
the
slightest
pink
twinge
to
it
some
white
foam
and
spotty
lace
brilliant
clarity
smells
like
a
light
beer
with
strawberries
and
honey
really
simple
a
pleasant
nose
with
nice
subtly
taste
is
interestingly
fruity
the
strawberries
are
there
slightly
tart
and
effervescent
there
is
a
certain
woody
flavor
along
with
the
honey
which
is
slight
and
just
barely
perceptible
thin
with
hi
carb
and
a
wet
finish
its
an
okay
beer
but
not
something
i
am
likely
to
seek
out
again
interesting
concept
and
reminds
me
more
that
i
drink
the
bottle
of
the
flavor
i
get
in
quaker
instant
strawberries
and
cream
oatmeal
but
way
more
subtle
more
like
an
undertow
overall
much
better
than
i
expected
though
this
is
also
my
first
ever
glutenfree
beer
for
what
it
is
i
feel
it
is
a
success
but
i
dont
foresee
myself
desiring
to
purchase
more
in
the
near
future
should
i
ever
fall
prey
to
a
disease
that
required
i
only
consume
glutenfree
food
though
well
i
suppose
that
i
wouldnt
mind
sipping
on
this
regularly
o
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
dogfish
head
beer
it
seems
like
a
halfformed
idea
of
a
beer
pours
a
light
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
in
the
aroma
fresh
strawberries
and
a
mint
like
herbal
note
the
taste
is
similar
tasty
strawberries
gummy
sorghum
a
touch
of
herb
spice
bitters
and
finishes
sweet
not
too
beery
but
a
little
alcohol
comes
off
a
bit
winecooleresque
but
a
good
one
refreshing
flavor
light
bodied
fizzy
feel
overall
this
is
a
great
option
for
those
with
gluten
allergies
tastes
like
a
more
commercial
flavored
malt
beverage
sans
malt
actually
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
maybe
a
little
too
strawberrydominated
but
it
doesnt
come
across
too
artificial
or
cloying
gives
festina
pêche
a
run
for
its
summer
money
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
13012
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
strawberries
honey
and
theres
also
a
grainy
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
slight
green
grapewhite
winelike
flavor
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
and
it
has
decent
carbonation
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
enough
brew
for
a
glutenfree
beer
its
not
bad
at
all
id
buy
it
again
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
8
99
for
a
4pack
overall
i
like
the
honey
and
berry
characteristics
but
i
feel
like
they
arent
supported
by
the
malt
bill
very
watery
on
the
taste
this
is
my
first
sorghum
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
hold
it
up
against
but
maybe
people
with
gluten
allergies
just
werent
meant
to
drink
beer
nutrition
facts
on
the
label
holy
shit
sam
youve
gone
main
stream
170
calories
in
a
gluten
free
beer
this
isnt
light
beer
certified
gluten
free
i
havent
seen
that
on
the
other
celiac
friendly
beers
this
one
pours
with
a
very
fizzy
carbonation
forms
a
white
head
while
the
body
is
a
light
pale
copper
with
maybe
a
kiss
of
pink
showing
off
the
strawbeery
juice
added
aroma
is
tame
a
hint
of
fruit
tart
fruit
but
i
cant
really
say
strawberry
from
just
the
smell
also
a
bit
of
generic
assorted
grains
with
a
touch
of
honey
notes
flavor
wise
its
kind
of
like
kissing
a
strawberry
blonde
hippie
chick
that
hasnt
bathed
in
a
few
days
theres
just
something
not
right
about
it
a
layer
of
mint
or
earthiness
a
little
bit
of
a
dirty
layer
of
beeswax
and
buckwheat
tart
strawberry
jame
like
real
jam
minus
the
concentrated
sugars
even
bodied
carbonation
finishes
a
bit
strange
and
i
cant
believe
its
six
percent
alcohol
by
volume
an
interesting
beer
for
all
of
the
celiac
patients
out
there
and
i
think
chicks
would
have
loved
it
if
the
calorie
count
was
staring
them
in
the
face
overall
a
nice
attempt
at
a
craft
version
of
a
gluten
free
beer
that
is
palatable
with
a
dfh
spin
o
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
one
of
my
least
favorite
dfh
beers
it
wasnt
overly
filled
with
flavor
and
the
flavor
it
did
have
was
kind
of
a
watered
down
strawberry
white
wine
flavor
not
really
my
style
of
beer
but
i
could
maybe
see
how
some
people
might
like
it
o
so
i
guess
dfh
is
going
to
produce
this
one
several
times
a
year
during
between
seasons
hence
the
name
tweasonale
this
was
good
but
not
great
however
those
of
you
who
love
ciders
as
opposed
to
beer
are
going
to
love
it
o
nowhere
near
as
good
as
i
hoped
and
not
as
bad
as
i
feared
an
ok
experience
but
not
one
to
seek
out
again
back
to
the
drawing
board
dfh
this
is
interesting
to
say
the
most
not
my
style
nor
my
flavor
i
like
the
effort
and
at
least
its
glutenfree
right
i
dunno
ill
just
avoid
this
one
from
here
on
out
cheers
o
great
fruit
beer
i
will
be
drinking
many
more
of
these

mouthfeel
with
a
dry
strawberry
to
small
honey
like
aftertaste
a
bit
dry
and
the
honey
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
much
o
overall
i
think
they
accomplished
creating
a
great
glutenfree
beer
for
people
who
are
left
out
of
a
giant
array
of
beers
that
we
who
can
drink
gluten
typically
enjoy
this
still
isnt
my
thing
but
i
respect
the
breweries
efforts
here
at
least
i
was
able
to
finish
the
beer
unlike
a
lot
of
gluten
free
offerings
overall
if
this
wasnt
gluten
free
i
might
even
enjoy
it
more
but
its
not
too
bad
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
anytime
soon
o
a
very
subtle
drinkable
beer
not
like
a
lot
of
dogfish
beers
that
focus
on
being
over
the
top
i
could
see
this
being
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
although
it
is
deffinatley
a
bit
girly
for
my
taste
i
am
not
a
silliac
and
i
kinda
wonder
how
somone
who
is
would
enjoy
this
seems
like
it
would
be
a
great
alternative
especially
if
you
were
a
girl
or
a
guy
who
likes
light
spritzy
strawberryish
drinks
cheers
feel
is
light
with
a
spritzy
feel
on
the
1st
sips
yet
this
just
sort
of
whimpers
away
feeling
this
less
and
less
as
it
warms
overall
glad
i
tried
this
for
a
go
but
wont
be
seeing
it
again
just
not
my
bag
o
ive
certainly
had
better
gluten
free
beers
than
this
mbege
and
shakparo
from
sprecher
come
to
mind
which
i
think
are
vastly
underrated
but
this
has
a
unique
flavour
profile
which
distinguishes
it
from
your
everyday
hunky
dory
gluten
free
beer
and
all
beer
for
that
matter
the
flavours
are
good
the
beer
is
thin
frankly
i
think
some
gluten
would
help
it
to
add
some
body
but
thats
not
what
dogfish
head
set
out
to
do
so
i
will
review
as
such
at
9
994pack
the
qpr
is
not
great
but
for
celiacs
i
think
this
is
a
worthy
effort
to
try
and
for
the
regular
beer
consumer
it
wouldnt
hurt
to
try
a
single
to
change
up
the
repertoire
to
fruity
for
me
not
a
big
fan
of
real
fruity
beer
but
if
you
cant
have
gluten
then
mos
def
try
it
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
not
the
best
but
still
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
o
i
was
unsure
what
to
expect
but
i
really
liked
this
and
would
drink
it
again
it
be
interesting
to
try
from
the
bottle
to
see
if
there
are
any
differences
md
light
bodied
with
some
lively
carbonation
the
flavor
is
there
and
is
a
nice
alternative
for
for
a
gluten
free
actually
by
far
the
best
choice
that
ive
had
so
far
for
what
it
is
its
a
decent
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
went
down
very
easy
o
overall
its
a
great
light
flavored
beer
its
something
to
drink
when
its
really
hot
out
or
when
looking
for
a
beer
that
isnt
going
to
overpower
the
flavor
of
something
light
like
a
salad
or
fish
i
would
buy
it
again
and
i
think
its
amazing
that
its
glutenfree
its
going
into
the
memory
bank
of
beers
to
recommend
to
people
with
gluten
allergies
body
was
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
fairly
high
carbonation
very
refreshing
beer
that
i
think
i
would
enjoy
more
on
a
summer
day
than
in
winter
poured
clear
golden
with
a
fuzzy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
sweet
aroma
flowery
with
obvious
hints
of
strawberry
candy
those
little
candies
that
have
wrappers
that
look
like
strawberries
taste
that
delivered
what
was
promised
with
sweet
strawberry
candy
very
obvious
grains
bubblegum
wet
grass
and
wildflowers
obviously
this
is
not
a
beer
for
everyone
but
for
what
its
worth
i
found
it
to
be
very
nice
light
body
and
very
easily
drinkable
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
slight
pink
hue
and
a
thin
white
ring
of
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
just
a
slight
stream
of
bubbles
aromas
is
certainly
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
strawberry
a
touch
of
honey
and
an
off
grainy
character
that
must
be
from
the
sorghum
taste
is
spoton
with
the
nose
very
sweet
with
lots
of
strawberry
honey
and
an
almost
applecider
quality
i
dont
think
id
immediately
guess
gluten
free
just
dont
expect
anything
too
crazy

the
perfect
fruity
beer
brewed
in
the
perfect
city
go
bombers
first
discovered
this
beer
at
a
ny
tap
festival
it
was
my
first
fruit
beer
i
would
say
and
has
since
lead
me
to
try
a
few
others
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
drinking
alcohol
while
eating
food
its
usually
one
or
the
other
aside
from
buffalo
wings
and
football
spectator
foods
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
in
that
instance
it
competes
well
with
juice
and
soda
and
is
by
far
is
my
favorite
peachapricot
inspired
beer
pale
orange
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
overpowering
apricot
aroma
and
flavor
kind
of
like
a
beer
cooler
but
it
kind
of
worked
such
a
crisp
light
beer
perfect
with
dinner
o
3
25
i
dont
know
the
abv
yet
but
i
am
guessing
5
5
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
summer
beer
out
on
the
dock
really
refreshing
and
a
surprisingly
nice
fruit
flavor
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
in
the
summer
to
share
nice
apricot
inspired
beer
slightly
dry
not
too
sweet
good
stuff
if
you
like
the
flavor
pours
a
peach
colored
and
slightly
hazy
liquid
with
very
little
and
quickly
disappearing
head
the
aroma
does
as
the
name
suggests
have
a
hint
of
apricot
however
not
strong
enough
to
my
liking
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
and
low
on
hops
a
refreshing
beer
but
ultimately
too
bland
for
my
tastes
o
refreshing
and
a
good
thirst
quencher
easy
to
drink
i
generally
dont
like
fruit
beers
but
on
a
hot
day
this
was
an
enjoyable
diversion
from
my
usual
hop
bombs
overall
ithica
is
capable
of
much
better
i
get
that
fruit
wheat
beers
arent
generally
targeted
at
the
beer
geek
audience
but
there
just
isnt
any
flavor
in
this
o
im
not
sure
youd
want
to
drink
this
unless
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
in
the
first
place
i
could
see
using
this
in
cooking
or
accompanying
a
wide
variety
of
summertime
foods
namely
barbequed
chicken
or
shrimp
not
to
mention
salads
with
vinaigrette
mandarin
oranges
and
toasted
candied
almonds
im
a
major
sucker
for
fruit
beer
so
i
had
to
try
this
one
it
was
my
first
time
at
a
local
bar
and
i
was
waiting
for
my
aunt
and
uncle
to
meet
me
after
work
so
i
ordered
this
beer
with
my
fries
it
was
sweet
but
not
too
much
so
in
other
words
you
could
definitely
still
taste
the
beer
in
it
there
was
a
perfect
blend
of
sweetness
and
yet
a
tiny
bite
to
it
it
was
very
smooth
and
amazing
when
ice
cold
if
i
came
across
it
again
id
definitely
go
for
a
second
taste
overall
i
havent
tried
many
if
any
apricot
beers
if
nothing
else
this
beer
demonstrates
that
the
flavors
can
work
together
probably
better
too
o
its
certainly
refreshing
good
to
quench
a
thirst
has
a
strong
apricot
smell
and
taste
without
in
my
opinion
being
too
fruity
or
sweet
its
just
good
sipping
goes
down
easy
hence
stock
up
please
and
i
enjoyed
having
them
i
like
this
beer
i
thinks
its
dope
aint
care
what
youse
all
thinks
beer
be
tastin
mighty
fine
to
me
peaze
it
nahimsayin
building
the
street
credit
is
what
robbie
p
says
do
what
you
gotta
do
get
it
kryzzl
be
liking
it
too
das
it
gurl
joel
says
f
that
bs
an
average
fruit
beer
smells
good
but
tastes
a
little
bland
this
beer
would
be
pretty
good
if
it
just
had
some
more
body
and
flavor
o
its
ok
missing
something
in
the
wheat
category
though
o
i
was
not
expecting
a
lot
from
the
beers
i
had
on
this
day
because
it
was
a
little
beer
cruise
around
manhattan
this
beer
was
refreshing
but
taste
wise
it
was
nothing
to
brag
about
overall
if
its
what
you
like
they
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
not
too
sweet
with
real
apricot
flavor
would
enjoy
this
one
again
not
really
a
beer
that
is
going
to
wow
many
craft
beer
fans
but
is
different
the
apricot
flavor
is
good
and
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
id
not
try
this
again
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
overall
this
was
not
what
id
ever
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
its
not
nasty
at
all
but
the
flavors
are
not
pleasant
for
what
is
labeled
as
a
wheat
beer
try
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
different
kind
of
wheat
beer
or
anything
that
is
plain
mild
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
to
me
their
are
american
german
and
belgian
wheat
beers
that
are
much
much
better
than
this
probably
the
worst
beer
ithaca
makes
its
probably
not
made
for
people
on
this
site
overall
not
too
impressed
i
havent
had
this
in
a
quite
a
while
and
decided
to
add
it
to
a
mixed
six
the
other
day
because
i
remembered
actually
liking
this
brew
back
in
the
day
not
so
much
anymore
smells
pretty
great
but
the
flavor
profile
just
isnt
there
ill
get
down
on
some
flower
power
all
day
but
i
definitely
wont
be
drinking
this
stuff
anymore
o
smells
great
and
has
a
good
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
is
weak
there
was
also
virtually
no
head
o
good
summer
beer
and
for
those
that
enjoy
strong
fruit
flavor
othis
started
off
okay
but
it
might
have
well
been
labeled
shock
top
its
that
bad
didnt
even
want
to
finish
after
getting
half
way
through
i
hope
ithicas
other
offerings
are
better
had
this
beer
the
other
day
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
and
grill
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
fruity
beers
but
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
definitly
a
distinct
apricot
taste
slightly
on
the
sweeter
side
enjoyed
the
citrus
aroma
but
not
my
favorite
beer
on
the
flip
side
my
girlfriend
loved
it
head
did
not
last
long
cloudy
yellow
appearance
expected
more
of
a
golden
yellow
look
sweet
as
expected
apricot
taste
is
kind
of
artificial
maybe
ok
for
a
hot
summer
day
purchased
in
a
craft
pack
so
only
have
one
to
drink
which
is
probably
enough
for
now
might
be
a
good
breakfast
drink
as
a
replacment
of
oj
overall
ah
it
is
an
ok
beer
but
somewhat
one
dimensional
and
a
bit
to
sour
up
front
not
one
i
would
go
to
with
real
occasion
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumblerpint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
orangeyellow
coloring
with
no
head
but
a
ton
of
carbonation
bubbling
throughout
aromas
of
apricot
slightly
sour
apple
and
sugary
sweetness
smells
like
a
candyshop
flavors
are
clean
and
crisp
with
a
strong
apricot
charcter
in
the
forefront
followed
by
a
roasty
grain
backbone
and
tangy
apple
highlights
the
aftertaste
is
like
finishing
a
jolly
rancher
with
sugary
sweet
lingering
flavors
crisp
slightly
long
lasting
finish
refreshing
and
light
but
quickly
can
bbecome
overbearing
overall
well
i
dont
really
care
too
much
for
this
beer
i
guess
its
really
only
for
the
apricot
lovers
out
there
this
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
hot
summer
weather
this
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
for
an
outdoor
event
but
probably
not
an
every
day
drinker
not
crazy
about
this
beer
i
did
not
like
the
overbearing
apricot
taste
i
like
fruit
beers
during
the
hot
days
but
not
this
one
so
much
less
than
average
for
me
i
dont
think
i
will
be
trying
it
again
i
would
give
a
try
to
another
ithaca
beer
brand
a
boring
wheat
ale
from
a
promising
brewery
a
bit
of
a
letdown
3
0
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
will
have
it
again
i
was
surprised
not
too
shabby
their
version
of
the
now
famous
magic
hat
number
9
this
is
not
nearly
as
good
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
smells
overly
sweet
like
apricot
jam
or
preserves
rather
than
fresh
fruit
heavier
wheat
malt
and
some
hefe
style
yeast
peppery
and
zesty
flavor
is
kind
of
a
combination
of
all
the
aromas
with
the
apricot
coming
on
first
then
the
yeast
and
finally
the
malt
and
a
different
apricot
vibe
a
bit
more
tart
this
time
very
front
of
the
tongue
it
actually
crisps
up
nice
in
the
finish
and
isnt
a
bad
summer
drink
with
its
light
body
and
bubbly
carbonation
overall
though
i
think
ithaca
is
best
at
making
hoppy
beers
and
this
foray
into
the
fruit
side
is
not
my
favotite
passable
even
good
for
those
unfamiliar
with
the
number
9
but
an
inferior
poser
to
those
in
the
know
hang
me
for
that
if
you
want
but
i
stand
by
it
hows
that
for
a
review
double
simcoe
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
definitely
preferred
in
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
has
a
fresh
fruit
feel
and
honestly
you
cant
go
wrong
salud
its
an
apricot
beer
i
like
it
better
than
9
or
aprihop
fwiw
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
idea
but
poorly
executed
too
much
apricot
flavor
maybe
with
more
malt
or
sweetness
it
would
have
more
balance
this
beer
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
no
head
or
lace
theres
a
good
bit
of
fizz
the
aroma
is
a
small
amount
of
apricot
and
something
else
strange
the
flavor
has
an
apricot
tang
but
a
strange
sourness
and
funk
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
sticky
ithaca
apricot
wheat
is
not
a
good
beer
there
was
a
sticker
on
the
bottle
that
said
sample
not
for
resale
not
recommended
o
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
fruity
flavor
without
being
too
sweet
this
beer
has
a
golden
color
body
with
no
head
or
lace
to
it
the
smell
is
very
strong
of
apricot
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
malt
up
front
then
the
apricot
hits
your
taste
buds
hard
but
in
a
tasty
way
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
overall
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
espically
when
it
warms
up
a
little
bit
the
flavors
really
come
to
life
o
nice
feature
of
apricot
however
it
is
lacking
the
balance
that
would
make
this
be
more
refreshing
because
of
the
low
amount
of
carbonation
and
light
alcoholic
content
of
this
it
would
be
easy
to
down
a
few
in
a
sitting
while
the
apricot
is
a
decent
flavor
for
a
beer
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
where
one
could
enjoy
that
and
the
drinking
session
as
well
while
not
bad
this
been
is
unmemorable
at
best
overall
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
however
it
is
done
right
no
flavor
takes
control
of
the
drinking
experience
everything
is
balanced
well
overall
in
retrospect
i
probably
should
have
bought
something
else
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
and
this
one
didnt
change
that
fact
i
guess
its
decent
for
the
style
and
it
does
in
fact
have
a
lot
of
apricot
taste
just
not
something
id
buy
again
cloudy
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
decent
head
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
citrusy
apricot
aroma
with
grainy
notes
tastes
exactly
as
you
would
expect
to
comment
on
other
reviews
i
concur
by
saying
it
is
a
bit
light
and
onedimensional
but
overall
not
bad
at
all
when
compared
to
some
other
flavored
wheat
beers
tastes
good
is
refreshing
even
though
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
taste
just
like
apricot
wheat
beer
imagine
that
ok
you
can
do
better
o
the
aroma
was
about
the
only
good
thing
going
for
this
beer
yes
its
a
summer
fruit
beer
but
i
wanted
more
fruit
the
wheat
and
malts
took
over
the
flavor
profile
and
left
an
aftertaste
that
was
unpleasant
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
crazy
apricot
in
the
aroma
and
taste
this
was
not
overly
sweet
as
is
easy
to
do
but
rather
it
was
big
on
the
actual
tasting
notes
of
the
fruit
rather
than
the
general
sweetness
these
qualities
were
so
robust
in
fact
that
it
started
to
obscure
some
of
the
more
desired
flavors
like
the
grain
bill
that
would
have
helped
to
really
balance
this
guy
out
so
every
once
in
a
while
a
fruit
beer
will
turn
up
in
my
fridge
if
it
is
a
quality
brew
i
dont
care
what
kind
of
beer
it
is
i
have
always
been
impressed
with
ithaca
so
i
had
some
pretty
decent
expectations
for
this
brew
somewhat
dissapointed
the
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
which
quickly
dissipated
carbonation
bubbles
flowing
and
rampant
smell
was
sour
and
peachy
taste
was
bland
too
much
fake
apricot
flavor
which
came
through
as
exceedingly
sour
grain
and
straw
liquid
sour
peach
rings
not
a
bad
summer
beer
just
didnt
work
for
me
has
more
of
a
malt
beverage
feel
then
a
beer
overall
i
kind
of
like
simple
fruit
beers
from
time
to
time
but
this
really
could
use
another
level
of
tart
kind
of
like
weach
to
balance
the
soapy
flavors
of
hops
and
wheat
still
could
totally
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
overall
this
is
a
decent
selection
at
a
bar
in
the
summer
compared
to
the
alternatives
sam
summer
or
summer
shandy
from
millercoors
but
is
that
really
saying
much
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
unfortunately
they
werent
met
oh
well
overall
the
apricot
flavor
seems
extracted
and
fake
completely
overbearing
any
other
present
flavors
interesting
to
try
but
horrendously
balance
and
just
not
my
thing
bleached
white
head
of
large
bubbles
which
are
gone
seconds
after
the
pour
no
lacing
at
all
huge
amount
of
bubble
beads
inside
the
murky
dark
golden
to
amber
colored
liquid
close
to
fully
translucent
strong
apricot
on
the
nose
with
peach
and
yellow
apple
too
soft
lemon
juice
accents
the
wheat
component
is
relaxed
and
hard
to
individuate
slightly
honeyed
maybe
the
graininess
comes
out
more
as
it
warms
mediumbodied
smooth
and
close
to
soft
only
the
carbonation
adds
a
steady
tickle
not
overly
sweet
but
again
the
apricot
is
by
far
the
dominant
aspect
as
supported
by
pear
and
peach
along
with
juicy
orange
and
lemon
citrus
moderate
dosage
of
wheat
rye
and
some
biscuit
dries
up
sufficiently
by
the
end
to
achieve
balance
this
without
impinging
on
the
friendliness
of
the
fruitiness
if
you
want
an
apricot
beer
this
should
be
on
the
short
list
not
a
bad
summer
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
and
sessionable
but
ill
pass
in
the
future
d
uber
fruit
dominated
but
not
fake
or
cloying
still
the
fruit
is
strong
enough
to
basically
smoother
the
rest
there
is
a
bit
of
substance
in
the
background
yet
the
fruit
domination
gives
this
a
bit
of
a
cider
feel
in
all
fairness
it
is
quenching
and
good
for
a
summer
novelty
i
tried
this
on
a
whim
didnt
like
this
much
offflavors
were
present
with
the
good
ones
in
equal
strength
the
aroma
was
light
and
very
fruity
much
more
then
i
thought
it
would
be
to
be
honest
lots
of
light
grain
peach
apricot
and
various
other
notes
along
the
lines
not
really
picking
up
many
hops
in
here
neither
in
the
flavor
took
a
sip
and
could
have
sworn
this
was
like
a
lindemans
or
something
lots
of
light
sweet
peach
and
apricot
notes
some
light
grains
and
a
touch
of
yeast
very
light
body
almost
water
like
in
its
thinness
lots
of
carbonation
as
well
with
tons
of
bubbles
just
rippling
up
toward
the
surface
and
keeping
it
the
consistency
of
seltzer
almost
easily
sessionable
though
a
bit
too
fruity
to
throw
down
too
much
of
it
you
could
do
worse
for
a
hot
afternoon
quencher
but
i
cant
really
recommend
this
one
anymore
than
that
o
i
want
to
hope
that
this
was
the
beer
bars
fault
and
not
how
the
beer
actually
tastes
i
am
going
to
buy
a
single
bottle
just
to
compare
it
to
i
hope
that
i
have
a
better
experiance
with
this
beer
poured
into
a
perfect
pint
with
a
semihazy
darkwheat
colored
body
with
a
finger
and
a
half
head
that
dissipates
leaving
little
to
no
trace
as
i
have
been
coming
to
expect
from
fruit
beers
the
smell
is
of
tart
wheat
and
yeast
with
a
fresh
apricot
smell
the
taste
follows
through
not
much
else
going
on
here
a
little
hop
bitterness
a
little
more
midget
help
very
prickly
on
the
tongue
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
very
light
watery
high
carbonation
refreshing
and
very
high
drinkability
good
hot
weather
beer
ill
have
to
try
dfh
aprihop
next
spring
now
makes
me
wonder
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
or
something
the
rest
very
little
malt
presence
and
no
hop
profile
at
all
this
is
more
of
a
apricot
cider
than
beer
o
a
solid
entry
beer
to
get
someone
away
from
bmc
and
a
really
different
style
if
youre
in
the
right
mood
i
e
hot
and
thirsty
this
isnt
bad
at
all
or
if
you
want
less
fruit
this
will
do
it
o
deelicous
offering
from
my
favorite
brewery
this
is
definitely
a
summer
beer
and
i
love
it
highly
recommended
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
pouring
a
light
copper
orange
kind
of
color
the
most
dominant
smell
that
i
get
is
definately
apricots
with
maybe
a
small
floral
scent
to
it
as
for
the
taste
the
apricot
does
not
come
through
as
well
as
i
thought
it
would
by
the
smell
it
is
very
light
and
drinkable
which
seems
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
it
seems
like
a
mix
between
sea
dogs
apricot
wheat
and
magic
hat
9
leaning
more
towards
the
magic
hat
9
overall
good
but
doesnt
hold
a
tee
to
a
dfh
aprihop
would
like
to
try
this
right
after
a
magic
hat
9
to
compare
the
cpj
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
cloudy
orange
yellow
color
the
head
was
pretty
fluffy
looking
until
is
simmered
down
to
just
a
thin
white
film
over
the
beer
the
smell
is
soft
and
sweet
the
apricot
really
shines
through
here
the
flavors
of
wheat
and
just
a
hint
of
apricot
are
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
like
most
wheat
beers
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
for
the
summer
if
youre
into
stuff
like
that
d
very
drinkable
overall
very
light
and
crisp
the
beer
could
have
used
a
bit
more
body
to
avoid
the
watery
feeling
the
apricot
flavor
is
nice
and
strong
and
sweet
but
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
bit
single
twelveounce
bottle
copped
from
total
wine
more
consider
this
a
watereddown
version
of
magic
hats
more
famous
rendition
of
the
same
style
good
but
not
great
light
mouthfeel
easy
on
the
palate
definite
apricot
aroma
pouring
through
lightbodied
refreshing
but
lacking
substantial
taste
o
a
nice
novelty
fruit
beer
thatd
be
fun
on
a
hot
day
it
is
well
done
and
this
apricot
flavor
is
much
more
present
and
appealing
than
what
you
get
in
a
magic
hat
9
overall
ok
but
the
cloying
wheat
and
apricot
are
a
bit
much
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
on
the
smooth
side
with
high
fizzy
carbonation
a
very
light
body
and
decent
drinkability
not
an
every
day
beer
but
a
decent
enough
beer
to
mix
up
things
with
o
i
enjoyed
it
more
the
1st
time
versus
the
2nd
its
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
brew
and
although
its
on
the
sweet
side
its
great
for
summer
second
time
was
good
but
not
great
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
if
i
new
it
was
really
fresh
o
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
but
also
underwhelming
typical
and
weak
cheers
o
this
beer
tastes
like
apricots
if
you
do
not
like
sweet
beers
or
apricots
you
will
not
like
this
and
your
reviews
will
read
as
most
of
the
others
ive
read
like
sweet
crisp
beers
try
it
not
pass
on
it
d
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
itd
be
at
least
theres
truth
in
the
advertising
you
better
like
apricots
if
you
try
this
maybe
im
rating
it
against
what
i
was
hoping
to
drink
but
i
def
will
not
be
seeking
this
out
again
its
easily
drinkable
but
not
for
me
i
wouldnt
want
another
i
could
not
recommend
this
too
one
dimensional
and
artificial
kind
of
a
shame
because
ithaca
usually
brings
it
to
be
fair
i
tried
this
one
after
the
january
best
by
date
by
less
than
two
weeks
although
i
doubt
if
that
would
make
that
much
difference
the
beer
poured
light
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
long
enough
to
barely
notice
theres
some
obvious
carbonation
in
the
clear
body
the
nose
is
all
apricot
overpoweringly
so
yet
not
entirely
unpleasant
the
taste
is
also
overpoweringly
apricot
with
a
slight
bitterness
of
hops
and
an
off
taste
of
something
rotten
around
the
sides
and
back
of
the
tongue
that
isnt
noticeable
if
you
swallow
it
real
fast
that
of
course
makes
the
mouthfeel
real
difficult
to
discern
as
you
pound
it
down
to
avoid
the
atertaste
of
rotting
fruit
and
make
it
real
difficult
imagining
that
another
round
of
this
brew
would
be
enticing
pity
too
as
i
always
liked
apricots
d
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
but
theres
nothing
interesting
in
the
taste
that
would
make
me
consider
this
to
be
sessionable
b
d
this
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
so
itd
be
easy
to
kick
back
a
few
of
these
my
overall
experience
wasnt
impressive
though
so
i
might
want
to
reach
for
a
different
beer
come
round
two
poured
a
clear
light
gold
with
slow
carb
trailers
thin
whitish
head
soured
apricot
for
the
nose
taste
was
a
more
bitter
apricot
with
very
light
wheat
body
finished
sour
and
the
feel
was
generally
thin
overall
although
carbonated
well
meh
d
for
me
personally
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
my
wife
loves
it
though
to
each
his
own
my
favorite
beer
nice
and
smooth
great
apricot
taste
it
actually
tastes
like
real
apricots
and
not
an
extract
i
get
this
whenever
it
comes
out
wish
they
did
more
cases
of
just
this
its
always
in
the
sampler
but
rarely
alone
the
smell
is
absent
of
hops
all
apricot
which
i
like
would
reccomend
to
anyone
dthe
over
powering
apricots
are
not
a
plus
but
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
apricot
wheat
pours
out
a
glazed
golden
color
that
is
darker
than
expected
a
nice
amount
of
white
foam
and
small
lacde
patterns
scents
include
apricots
sweet
malt
and
grass
semi
sweet
taste
is
apricots
and
fruity
pebbles
with
malt
backing
a
small
hoppy
bite
that
is
light
barely
nothing
feel
is
slick
medium
lively
and
sweet
afterwards
which
kinda
kills
it
ive
been
avoiding
this
beer
for
a
while
and
now
i
know
why
its
better
than
number
9
though
ithaca
you
are
much
better
than
this
im
disappointed
in
you
this
beer
has
done
everything
in
its
power
to
win
my
one
and
only
grade
of
f
three
ounce
sample
in
a
nonstandard
stem
glass
color
is
gold
slight
orange
no
head
no
lacing
because
its
a
cask
beer
aroma
has
no
recognizable
hops
definitely
a
fruit
beer
heavy
ripe
apricot
a
little
tooo
ripe
taste
is
super
ripe
apricot
lightbodied
beer
does
not
stick
to
palate
i
think
this
beer
needs
to
cut
back
on
everything
including
the
apricots
i
believe
it
is
possible
to
have
a
nice
apricot
beer
on
cask
that
wont
be
too
sweet
this
was
such
an
easy
drinking
beer
ive
had
it
both
in
the
bottle
on
tap
at
bars
and
on
tap
at
the
brewery
on
tap
is
better
but
both
are
good
the
apricot
is
so
distinct
on
both
the
nose
and
while
drinking
on
the
nose
its
unmistakable
it
smells
sweet
florally
mixed
with
a
bit
of
honey
in
the
mouth
however
you
just
get
apricot
none
of
the
sweetness
that
you
would
imagine
from
such
a
big
nose
dont
think
this
is
one
of
those
sickly
sweet
fruit
beers
this
is
just
wheat
with
a
kick
in
the
head
of
pure
apricot
i
was
unable
to
finish
this
beer
due
to
the
flavor
and
lack
of
anything
appealing
i
will
not
buy
this
again
someone
recommended
this
to
me
now
i
know
not
to
trust
them
drinkability
a
decent
and
unassuming
beer
if
this
beer
was
more
available
in
my
area
i
could
see
it
becoming
a
regular
session
beer
theres
nothing
overtly
exciting
about
it
but
it
is
a
solid
drinkable
refreshing
brew
worth
a
try
at
least
not
recommended
i
hope
that
i
dont
accidentally
buy
one
of
these
again
oh
and
this
is
written
by
a
guy
who
loves
a
fruity
wheat
beer
this
is
a
terrible
beer
that
should
be
skipped
md
the
feel
is
okay
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
but
not
a
bad
american
fruit
wheat
beer
overall
a
soft
wheat
beer
with
a
distinct
apricot
taste
that
enhances
it
without
overwhelming
the
balance
this
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
the
flavor
is
just
complex
enough
without
being
overbearing
or
fake
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
well
the
smell
is
pretty
good
and
taste
is
spot
on
for
a
apricot
wheat
beer
it
is
the
most
that
taste
like
apricot
so
far
to
me
it
has
a
good
taste
and
goes
down
easy
not
much
else
to
say
on
it
it
is
a
good
summer
day
beer
out
on
the
patio
or
cutting
grass
or
even
at
a
concert
d
tastes
natural
so
its
ok
in
my
book
d
a
session
beer
for
sure
but
definitely
not
the
most
interesting
or
flavorful
just
really
plain
in
every
aspect
of
the
word
its
drinkable
for
sure
when
theres
nothing
better
around
but
i
dont
see
myself
reaching
for
it
if
i
have
other
choices
overall
a
really
decent
fruit
beer
however
i
cant
speak
for
the
bottled
version
it
makes
me
remember
the
first
time
i
had
cherry
wheat
on
tap
i
would
pick
up
a
growler
of
this
the
next
time
i
was
in
town
good
summer
beer
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
three
fingers
of
egg
shell
head
it
is
golden
the
smell
is
fresh
apricots
it
taste
is
apricot
as
expected
it
is
more
subtle
than
other
apricot
beers
ive
had
9
pyramid
i
thought
this
beer
might
be
refreshing
after
an
eleven
hour
workday
in
the
sun
its
decent
it
is
a
step
up
from
the
aforementioned
apricot
ales
d
my
apologies
to
the
fine
folks
at
ithaca
who
typically
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
but
this
one
is
a
little
bit
of
a
struggle
to
get
through
while
not
the
most
challenging
of
styles
both
fruit
and
wheat
beers
can
still
be
enjoyable
experiences
unfortunately
apricot
wheat
misses
that
mark
on
both
accounts
notes
this
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
but
still
has
decent
flavor
cheers
d
not
very
drinkable
for
me
due
to
the
very
bland
taste
i
wanted
a
beer
not
a
apricot
flavor
water
notes
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
isnt
quite
as
good
as
a
wheat
beer
as
i
would
like
but
as
far
as
fruit
beer
goes
it
is
better
than
most
if
they
could
amp
up
the
wheat
side
of
it
this
would
be
a
good
beer
ill
try
it
again
if
by
some
outside
chance
i
can
get
it
on
tap
but
otherwise
i
will
steer
clear
d
i
like
this
as
a
i
just
got
off
of
work
let
me
have
a
drink
and
enjoy
the
nice
weather
drink
this
six
pack
will
probably
last
me
a
good
while
though
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
a
clear
bright
golden
color
the
head
was
bone
white
fizzed
out
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
all
apricots
and
wheat
and
the
flavors
all
apricots
and
wheat
the
flavors
were
natural
as
opposed
to
that
of
artificial
or
candylike
apricot
not
particularly
sweet
and
fairly
balanced
but
also
quite
simplistic
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
bubbly
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
a
touch
high
not
to
be
too
vermont
biased
because
im
not
even
a
huge
magic
hat
fan
but
9
for
example
is
a
far
better
beer
than
this
poured
golden
orange
very
carbonated
into
a
pint
glass
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
smell
was
on
the
sweet
side
apricot
and
syrup
with
a
hint
of
earthinessleather
the
taste
was
fairly
bland
until
the
finish
where
the
apricot
flavor
popped
up
in
a
notthatannoying
amount
and
lingering
a
little
through
the
finish
i
actually
was
somewhat
positively
surprised
as
the
smell
had
me
expecting
a
syrupy
mess
but
it
wasnt
that
way
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
and
supercarbonated
drinkable
yes
but
i
cant
picture
me
having
more
than
one
of
these
d
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
drinkability
i
might
be
one
of
the
few
that
will
give
this
beer
a
good
review
is
it
amazing
mind
blowing
no
not
even
close
but
is
it
decent
and
not
bad
for
its
style
yes
the
only
thing
is
the
smell
over
powers
the
taste
of
the
beer
making
its
drinkability
a
little
lower
then
usual
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
pours
golden
orange
tinted
with
a
slight
haze
bright
white
head
fades
rather
quickly
aromatics
have
a
nice
earthy
almost
nutty
apricot
pit
like
note
mild
citrus
background
with
sharp
wheat
flavor
has
american
wheat
with
apricot
extract
written
all
over
it
decent
fruit
beer
my
mom
and
my
wife
both
dig
this
one
alot
more
than
i
do
again
that
earthy
apricot
pit
shows
up
in
the
finish
almost
as
a
lingering
bitterness
to
replace
the
low
hop
additions
i
guess
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
drinkability
im
sure
this
one
is
going
down
much
smoother
in
the
summer
months
i
can
see
where
some
people
might
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
isnt
for
me
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
poured
darker
golden
with
not
much
head
scents
of
strong
wheat
and
sugary
fruity
sweetness
nice
ripe
apricot
flavor
with
lots
of
carbonation
also
flavors
of
biscuits
or
bread
almost
like
a
doughnut
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
making
this
pretty
drinkable
not
one
i
would
reach
for
very
often
but
a
decent
beer
smells
like
wheat
and
apricot
extract
taste
follows
absolutely
average
nice
refreshing
alternative
to
a
bmc
but
more
of
a
gimmicky
chick
beer
mouthfeel
is
too
carbed
could
be
a
session
beer
nonoffensive
just
too
safe
and
average
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
its
pretty
straight
forward
not
very
interesting
but
it
is
refreshing
and
has
good
flavor
di
really
dont
like
fruit
or
wheat
beers
to
much
but
for
some
reason
i
like
this
one
i
find
it
very
drinkable
and
would
have
it
agian
if
i
ever
came
across
it
d
pretty
good
variation
on
your
usual
summer
wheat
ale
but
the
apricot
flavor
is
just
a
bit
much
for
me
to
want
to
have
more
than
one
ok
maybe
too
if
it
was
really
hot
and
there
werent
any
other
options
although
it
isnt
heavy
the
overpowering
apricot
taste
does
start
to
wear
on
you
over
time
cheers
drinkability
i
had
some
of
this
after
the
flower
power
which
i
loved
this
seems
pretty
mass
marketed
with
not
much
quality
attached
however
and
it
seems
like
another
fruit
beer
marketed
for
people
who
want
to
drink
beer
but
dont
want
to
have
it
taste
like
beer
thats
of
course
fine
in
some
respects
like
what
you
like
but
i
wouldnt
try
this
again
fruit
beer
or
otherwise
cheers
this
is
a
thirst
quencher
and
i
could
probably
pack
away
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
day
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
but
i
could
buy
it
again
for
sure
t
apricot
really
comes
through
overpowering
really
dry
its
a
solid
fruit
beer
but
i
can
only
have
a
few
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
any
real
depth
in
flavor
the
apricot
and
wheat
balance
is
nice
but
i
wish
the
flavor
profile
was
a
litte
beefier
thanks
jjayjaye
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
fairly
high
for
a
juice
it
doesnt
even
really
seem
to
be
a
beer
i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
compared
to
other
fruit
beers
ive
enjoyed
d
i
was
expecting
a
nice
mild
refreshing
thirst
quenching
beer
for
this
june
heat
wave
and
thats
what
i
got
i
even
ordered
it
on
tap
for
my
bar
after
i
blow
this
keg
of
allagash
wit
a
great
summer
beer
easy
drinking
and
smooth
and
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
apricot
and
wheat
are
a
perfect
match
imho
i
could
go
for
about
5
more
of
these
overall
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
nothing
that
hasnt
been
done
before
this
is
not
as
sweet
as
some
apricot
beers
i
have
had
which
is
a
bonus
not
the
best
but
would
drink
again
the
tartness
while
mild
conflicts
with
an
otherwise
standardtypical
american
fruit
pale
wheat
ale
i
was
almost
able
to
finish
it
off
and
suppose
i
could
have
but
didnt
want
to
not
something
i
would
recommed
even
to
apricot
lovers
d
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
sessioning
too
sweet
but
if
you
can
see
through
that
go
for
it
overallinteresting
flavor
choice
but
too
sweet
and
muddled
for
me
credit
for
originality
though
seriously
this
beer
is
underrated
give
it
a
go
this
summer
i
thought
this
was
better
than
some
of
the
other
fruited
beers
ive
had
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
i
think
it
will
find
its
way
into
my
summer
rotation
the
taste
is
a
touch
watery
and
the
slightly
burnt
and
musty
flavors
in
the
nose
make
their
way
into
the
taste
of
the
beer
too
the
apricot
is
less
over
the
top
in
the
taste
but
still
present
this
beer
isnt
all
that
good
and
the
burnt
flavor
is
a
turn
off
the
beer
is
light
pretty
unidimensional
and
a
touch
drying
on
the
back
side
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
with
no
hops
and
not
much
of
anything
besides
burnt
and
musty
flavored
dried
apricots
overall
i
got
this
bottle
at
the
foodery
in
philly
if
this
were
more
available
where
i
live
in
ny
i
might
consider
it
over
9
as
a
standby
brew
not
groundbreaking
but
nice
and
fruity
a
great
everyday
beer
this
is
also
one
fo
the
most
drinkable
beers
ever
it
is
very
light
and
you
could
get
through
6
before
you
even
know
what
you
are
doing
great
aroma
smells
exactly
how
it
tastes
a
cloudy
almond
tan
color
with
a
whispy
white
head
and
weak
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
fairly
subtle
but
sweet
fruit
perfumey
apricot
with
little
else
to
distinguish
it
by
my
nose
the
flavor
is
a
pleasant
but
sweet
apricot
reasonably
tempered
by
a
drinkable
wheat
base
its
a
bit
whimpy
in
body
even
for
the
style
a
bit
dead
but
not
too
bad
if
comparing
to
magic
hat
i
will
take
9
as
the
livelier
more
balanced
apricot
brew
drinkable
enough
d
i
have
to
admit
i
usually
hate
beers
that
are
intentionally
fruit
flavored
and
i
initially
tried
this
only
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
as
it
was
included
in
my
sampler
but
actually
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
finishing
the
rest
of
them
overall
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
a
letdown
the
intense
aroma
gave
way
to
an
average
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
my
appalachian
brewing
pint
glass
clear
and
fizzy
with
not
much
head
retention
or
lacing
the
smell
was
apricot
mania
with
a
distinct
candied
apricot
scent
way
more
than
i
expected
in
the
smell
department
this
would
probably
be
a
good
chick
beer
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
too
much
apricot
rated
mar
5
2007
d
i
really
liked
the
first
34
the
last
fourth
i
fouind
myself
in
need
of
a
hop
bomb
might
be
the
weetness
might
be
the
lack
of
complexity
i
liked
it
id
recommend
to
try
it
just
dont
know
if
i
could
or
would
want
to
kick
back
a
few
m
d
starts
out
feeling
rather
crisp
finishes
a
touch
sticky
id
be
more
than
happy
to
enjoy
it
on
a
sunny
summer
day
though
even
though
ill
admit
it
would
be
more
of
an
afterlunch
dessert
type
choice
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
its
not
terrible
either
looking
at
my
numbers
its
not
getting
anything
over
a
c
but
its
still
worth
a
shot
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
a
kind
of
bland
wheat
beer
the
apricot
flavor
isnt
overbearing
and
is
mixed
in
well
which
is
good
but
could
use
a
little
bit
more
of
a
flavor
kick
its
drinkable
but
then
again
so
is
water
theres
much
better
fruitwheats
out
there
and
this
brewery
has
much
better
options
too
overall
uh
apricot
beer
nuff
said
d
not
impressed
i
doubt
ill
try
this
again
very
sessionable
flavor
profile
is
good
but
not
great
preventing
a
slightly
higher
score
in
this
category
im
surprised
at
the
lack
of
love
for
this
fruit
beer
because
i
think
its
actually
quite
well
made
golden
body
with
a
small
white
head
fresh
burst
of
apricot
and
grain
in
the
aroma
relatively
straightforward
apricot
and
wheat
flavour
but
well
demarcated
and
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
and
a
relatively
light
beer
not
something
you
would
drink
in
the
middle
of
a
snowstorm
but
a
good
summer
brew
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
average
for
the
most
part
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
d
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
maybe
i
dont
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
thus
i
am
biased
i
probably
would
not
have
it
again
unless
i
developed
an
appreciation
of
fruit
beers
d
very
drinkable
but
is
not
for
beer
drinkers
more
someone
who
likes
a
light
variety
and
is
looking
to
enjoy
a
nice
dessert
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
from
ithaca
brewing
company
ive
had
a
chance
to
try
this
at
the
brewery
and
have
had
some
in
my
house
this
summer
almost
ever
since
its
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
for
people
who
like
a
fruit
beer
or
fruit
wheat
beer
this
is
a
super
light
beer
with
apricot
flavoring
and
as
such
i
am
not
really
a
fan
an
interesting
change
up
from
the
other
stuff
ive
been
drinking
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
cheers
drinkability
certainly
no
drinkability
issues
but
im
not
left
yearning
for
another
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
1
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
fades
fast
leaving
not
much
lacing
smells
big
on
apricots
with
some
straw
and
wheat
backing
it
up
tastes
strongly
of
apricot
up
front
with
some
spices
and
a
nice
light
wheat
backbone
and
a
touch
more
citrus
in
the
finish
light
in
body
with
strong
fizzy
sparkling
carbonation
very
fruity
but
just
enough
wheat
presence
to
remind
you
this
is
a
beer
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
not
something
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
unless
i
was
in
the
mood
for
apricot
overall
a
decent
beer
if
you
love
apricot
they
arent
kidding
would
be
better
with
a
bit
more
hops
medium
amber
color
with
not
much
head
at
all
and
lacing
that
disappears
after
the
first
few
sips
the
aroma
of
the
apricot
hits
you
first
rather
crisply
light
in
body
makes
it
go
down
quite
easy
and
you
may
want
it
to
because
the
taste
gives
off
slight
metallic
flavors
at
first
then
the
apricot
and
finishes
with
the
wheat
it
actually
feels
good
in
the
mouth
despite
this
and
could
be
a
session
beer
if
the
flavor
suits
you
a
great
summer
beer
and
an
even
better
beer
for
the
gals
this
is
a
decent
wheat
but
if
your
like
me
and
want
the
ultimate
wheat
experience
all
the
time
youll
be
more
disappointed
than
if
you
got
a
three
dollar
hooker
d
overall
a
very
fruity
summer
or
lawnmower
beer
but
could
be
better
if
the
flavor
was
toned
down
a
tad
and
the
yeast
and
hops
were
allowed
to
compliment
the
overpowering
apricot
sweetness
i
couldnt
drink
very
many
of
these
too
sweet
and
lacking
balance
a
friend
gave
a
me
a
bottle
of
this
a
few
months
ago
and
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
this
weekend
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
so
i
was
a
little
skeptical
pours
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
of
apricots
and
not
much
else
it
has
a
sweet
apricot
flavor
quite
frankly
the
aroma
is
better
than
the
taste
d
this
beer
suffers
from
a
lack
of
depth
and
this
hurts
an
otherwise
refreshing
beer
d
definately
a
summertime
brew
not
my
thing
but
they
did
a
good
job
to
the
style
d
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
kind
of
has
a
magic
hat
9
vibe
going
on
but
not
quite
as
thick
or
bitter
decent
beer
thats
probably
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
poured
a
light
copper
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
smell
is
a
nice
refreshing
apricot
on
top
of
a
standard
citrusy
yeasty
wheat
beer
background
the
taste
starts
with
tasty
apricots
that
arent
sickly
sweet
which
was
unexpected
following
the
apricot
upfront
there
was
some
refreshing
citrusy
tartness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
some
fairly
sharp
carbonation
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
i
imagine
ill
be
grabbing
a
sixpack
or
two
come
summertime
nothing
impressive
looks
wise
here
a
little
deeper
in
color
than
an
average
macro
lager
smell
was
apricot
duh
and
not
much
else
from
the
smell
which
i
must
say
was
very
pleasing
i
expected
to
be
drinking
apricot
juice
but
it
wasnt
as
dominating
as
one
would
think
it
was
actually
balanced
out
pretty
well
with
an
earthy
taste
on
the
tongue
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
it
is
a
good
option
at
a
picnic
and
i
expect
it
would
do
well
with
the
ladies
decent
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
apricot
wheats
are
one
of
the
few
fruity
type
beers
that
i
will
drink
i
was
going
to
rereview
this
to
give
it
a
fair
chance
i
had
a
thought
that
maybe
i
destroyed
my
palate
with
some
of
the
other
beers
i
was
drinking
at
the
time
i
was
dissappointed
to
find
out
i
was
right
the
first
time
had
a
2
oz
sample
poured
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
into
a
glass
tasting
glass
much
better
than
the
plastic
cups
that
some
breweries
use
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
which
dissipates
no
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
quite
fruity
with
apricots
really
coming
through
as
well
as
a
bit
of
the
hops
and
some
esters
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
with
a
tartness
from
the
hops
balanced
by
the
added
sweetnes
from
the
apricots
in
the
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
content
mix
well
with
the
sugars
from
the
apricots
to
give
a
good
drinkability
this
beer
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
minimum
head
which
disapeared
rather
quickly
the
beer
smelled
as
advertised
slight
apricot
a
citusy
smell
the
beer
tasted
like
watered
down
apricot
syrup
with
flat
wheat
beer
realistically
i
am
not
sure
where
this
beer
has
been
since
it
was
a
one
of
a
kind
find
in
my
moms
fridge
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
i
would
definitely
try
again
under
different
circumstances
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
then
disappears
the
aroma
is
of
apricot
and
some
light
wheat
but
pretty
much
all
apricot
the
taste
is
of
apricot
and
some
wheat
the
apricot
overwhelms
most
of
everything
but
it
isnt
bad
its
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
good
could
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
but
it
still
has
a
good
mouthfeel
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
probably
have
a
few
more
of
these
if
i
could
drinkability
one
of
those
beers
thats
just
not
for
me
d
the
low
abv
means
that
if
i
were
of
a
certain
mind
i
could
pound
these
babies
all
day
long
unfortunately
i
am
not
of
that
mind
and
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
d
fruit
beers
arent
my
favorite
but
this
on
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
very
mild
body
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
carbonation
is
nicely
balanced
but
the
body
is
quite
watery
this
would
make
a
nice
drinker
if
i
were
swinging
a
hammer
on
a
roof
but
honestly
this
is
a
very
weak
brew
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
sweet
apricots
very
big
nose
in
the
taste
kind
of
sugary
and
a
dry
apricot
flavor
a
smooth
and
sweet
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
apricot
aftertaste
big
flavor
of
apricot
and
a
nice
dryness
to
it
a
bit
too
sugary
but
it
fits
in
this
beer
although
the
apricot
flavor
can
be
powerful
its
a
very
nice
beer
i
can
see
myself
drinking
several
i
liked
the
beer
overall
but
i
personally
prefer
a
darker
beer
i
have
sampled
the
3
main
ithaca
beers
and
this
ranks
2
out
of
3
d
as
advertised
its
apricot
its
wheat
dunno
what
more
to
say
about
it
light
refreshing
and
pretty
straightforward
im
a
sucker
for
apricot
so
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
as
long
as
i
dont
have
to
pay
for
it
otherwise
theres
a
lot
better
out
there
if
it
were
an
apricot
i
wanted
id
think
twice
before
getting
this
again
particularly
if
there
were
a
dogfish
head
aprihop
wheat
or
seadog
apricot
available
nothing
impressive
looks
wise
here
a
little
deeper
in
color
than
an
average
macro
lager
smell
was
apricot
duh
and
not
much
else
from
the
smell
which
i
must
say
was
very
pleasing
i
expected
to
be
drinking
apricot
juice
but
it
wasnt
as
dominating
as
one
would
think
it
was
actually
balanced
out
pretty
well
with
an
earthy
taste
on
the
tongue
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
it
is
a
good
option
at
a
picnic
and
i
expect
it
would
do
well
with
the
ladies
decent
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
very
pronounced
apricot
notes
with
a
clean
wheat
finish
another
great
summer
brew
from
ithaca
beer
co
ive
decided
to
cut
apricot
wheat
some
slack
where
scores
are
concerned
since
its
such
a
solid
example
of
the
style
whether
that
style
is
worth
drinking
or
not
is
up
to
you
i
still
dont
like
apricots
lightvery
grainyvery
rough
for
what
should
be
a
light
beer
feels
like
cough
syrup
in
the
mouth
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
again
no
idea
of
the
price
but
a
different
summer
beer
for
the
deck
party
i
bit
over
the
top
for
me
but
its
beer
like
this
that
helps
us
appreciate
better
beer
12
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
pry
off
cap
new
graphics
pours
a
dull
semi
cloudy
light
goldenapricot
nose
is
perfumy
fruity
and
sweet
apricot
present
in
the
flavor
profile
but
its
sort
of
candied
in
nature
tastes
too
sweet
and
not
all
that
natural
and
also
a
bit
watery
in
the
mid
section
expensive
lawn
mower
beer
at
best
very
thin
in
the
mouth
and
i
would
have
to
say
not
very
drinkable
i
will
finish
this
one
and
pass
the
other
two
from
the
sampler
on
to
someone
else
im
not
even
sure
that
the
ladies
would
like
this
one
maybe
the
bmc
drinking
ladies
might
find
it
interesting
part
of
an
assortment
12pack
4
different
ithaca
brews
i
pickedup
at
the
beer
zoo
outside
hershey
pa
i
hadnt
heard
of
ithaca
but
i
bought
it
specifically
to
try
the
apricot
i
was
not
disappointed
im
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
fan
but
theres
something
about
the
way
the
apricot
was
usedlike
hopsto
add
a
ctiruslike
edge
to
balance
the
malt
pale
gold
color
small
head
that
stayed
through
a
few
sips
apricot
in
the
nose
with
a
mostly
malt
taste
nicely
done
refreshing
just
had
this
at
friends
fire
tastes
a
lot
like
an
apricot
yogurt
a
domineering
apricot
start
with
a
solid
wheaty
finish
very
palatable
the
middleground
between
a
magic
hat
9
and
a
dogfish
head
aprihop
the
mouthfeel
is
as
expected
thin
but
creamy
with
carbonation
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
good
apricot
brew
d
i
certainly
wouldnt
get
tired
of
this
but
some
variety
would
be
nice
on
the
tongue
well
this
on
is
basically
light
and
tastes
like
apricot
flavoring
like
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
actual
apricot
it
taste
like
a
highfructose
corn
syrupbased
apricot
juice
with
a
slight
light
barley
background
still
inoffensive
overall
and
easy
to
dink
poured
a
sunset
gold
hue
with
minimal
head
that
was
quick
to
fizzle
out
smells
sweeter
than
i
expected
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
subtle
like
my
old
pal
numero
nueve
this
beer
however
had
a
strong
syrupy
smell
and
taste
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
they
were
really
cold
but
i
wouldnt
otherwise
choose
this
beer
again
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
is
reminiscent
of
wachusetts
blueberry
ale
which
i
find
to
be
revolting
the
wheat
beer
foundation
in
this
guy
is
solid
enough
that
the
syruposity
is
somewhat
masked
but
overall
its
just
not
a
very
balanced
beer
drinkability
i
like
some
fruit
beers
but
never
tried
an
apricot
beer
ba
list
well
more
then
a
dozen
great
summer
beer
i
did
enjoy
this
i
picked
up
a
12
mixed
pack
thick
like
a
juice
laves
quite
the
soursweet
aftertaste
this
is
really
a
beer
for
those
who
like
wine
coolers
or
fruit
drinks
its
not
for
beer
drinkers
in
my
opinion
too
bad
they
have
to
include
three
of
these
in
the
ithaca
12pack
its
a
girl
drink
and
its
hard
to
finish
i
actually
poured
it
out
with
about
13
left
d
not
very
drinkable
its
low
alcohol
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
maybe
its
better
in
summer
when
its
hot
thanks
to
wasatch
for
this
sample
drinkability
seemed
to
be
over
carbonated
and
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
apricot
flavor
was
overpowering
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
i
can
see
this
one
being
a
summer
time
favorite

itll
definitely
quench
your
thirst
its
not
for
everyone
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
wheatfruit
beer
give
this
one
a
try
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
wheat
ale
left
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
dissapated
quickly
into
a
ring
around
the
top
the
smell
was
distinctly
of
apricots
with
a
little
bit
of
the
yeasty
bread
smell
in
the
background
which
was
tough
to
pick
up
the
taste
was
very
much
of
apricots
as
another
reviewer
noted
far
more
than
magic
hat
9
likely
because
of
the
inherent
sweetness
of
wheat
ales
and
wheat
it
really
didnt
get
more
complex
than
its
own
name
there
was
a
yeasty
characteristic
to
the
aftertaste
but
it
was
still
mostly
fruity
i
could
detect
essentially
no
hops
flavor
and
thus
no
bitterness
but
the
beer
somehow
doesnt
become
overwhelmingly
or
cloyingly
sweet
which
i
liked
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
great
and
this
beer
screams
summer
overall
a
good
choice
if
you
want
to
pick
up
something
for
a
picnic
or
bbq
because
its
likely
even
your
nonbeer
drinking
friends
will
enjoy
this
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
creamy
two
finger
head
which
leaves
quickly
little
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
some
hops
apricots
and
wheat
the
taste
is
sweet
lots
of
apricots
and
grassy
light
body
drinkable
a
nice
thirst
quencher
d
i
didnt
find
it
very
tasty
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
might
able
to
turn
someone
off
of
a
macro
if
they
like
the
apricot
flavor
within
the
style
ive
certainly
had
better
to
compare
it
with
a
beer
of
the
same
fruit
flavor
i
did
like
it
better
than
magic
hat
9
however
this
would
be
one
of
my
last
choices
when
buying
beer
if
you
enjoy
fruit
beers
this
is
surely
one
for
you
this
has
even
more
apricot
than
magic
hat
9
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
powerful
scent
of
apricot
and
peach
with
little
head
drinkability
depends
on
if
sweetness
is
your
thing
people
who
enjoy
mixed
drinks
will
probably
drink
this
for
a
beer
but
someone
who
enjoys
hops
will
avoid
this
beer
definitely
something
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
give
it
a
try
bottle
from
a
12pk
sampler
picked
up
at
wegmans
in
syracuse
gold
and
slightly
hazy
with
just
a
patchy
white
head
woah
smells
like
an
apricot
jolly
rancher
or
somesuch
taste
is
the
same
sweet
sweet
apricot
no
room
for
anything
else
im
sure
there
is
a
market
for
this
beer
just
waaay
out
of
balance
for
those
who
want
a
beer
based
mixed
drink
wafts
of
slightly
skunky
wheat
and
apricot
come
off
the
huge
bubbly
head
inviting
nonetheless
its
a
somewhat
thin
ale
but
with
a
big
dried
apricot
payoff
there
is
none
of
that
syrupystickyoverly
sweet
element
that
turns
people
off
to
fruit
beers
it
is
however
still
on
the
dessert
beer
side
of
the
spectrum
due
to
the
strength
of
the
apricot
in
the
profile
i
would
love
to
have
one
of
these
after
any
kind
of
dinner
meal
a
prenight
cap
beer
or
warm
up
before
bed
brew
pours
to
a
strange
yellow
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
vanishes
extremely
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
what
so
ever
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
of
apricots
and
i
think
that
is
about
it
but
the
apricot
aroma
is
not
that
enticing
seems
to
be
way
over
the
top
the
taste
thankfully
does
not
have
as
big
of
an
apricot
taste
as
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
but
it
certainly
is
the
most
noticeable
aspect
of
this
brew
i
also
notice
a
very
watery
feel
to
the
brew
seems
like
it
is
very
thin
i
guess
it
is
an
ok
brew
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
felt
it
could
be
so
much
more
only
called
apricot
wheat
now
with
a
nice
orange
yellow
label
was
really
not
impressed
with
this
beer
whatsoever
i
like
apricots
i
e
9
and
others
however
this
was
very
blah
a
very
pale
yellow
color
had
a
very
wheat
taste
to
the
beer
almost
like
drinking
a
loaf
of
bread
was
not
a
big
fan
had
a
very
decent
apricot
flavor
in
the
end
though
and
some
decent
apricot
smell
not
one
of
my
favorites
worth
it
to
try
if
you
get
the
ithaca
mixed
case
but
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
fizzy
and
light
body
but
surprisingly
not
very
carbonated
in
the
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
a
bit
tart
but
overall
kind
of
dull
and
uninteresting
cheers
drinkability
well
this
is
the
second
beer
in
my
long
list
that
ive
actually
had
to
pour
out
pretty
average
looking
beer
pale
golden
color
without
much
of
a
head
smell
is
strong
apricot
with
a
graininess
lurking
in
the
background
taste
is
apricots
balanced
nicely
with
the
wheat
flavor
what
makes
this
beer
work
for
me
is
that
its
not
really
sweet
like
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
mouthfeel
is
denser
than
one
would
think
from
looking
at
it
has
a
dry
finish
with
a
bit
of
lingering
apricot
flavor
im
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
and
found
it
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
taste
is
a
malty
wheaty
light
ale
with
a
hint
of
nicely
ripened
apricot
as
it
is
described
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
on
a
hot
day
they
can
be
appropriate
and
this
might
be
one
of
th
ebest
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
definitely
a
good
one
for
the
style
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
while
im
going
from
memory
here
i
believe
that
this
is
a
slightly
drier
version
would
probably
make
a
pretty
good
icecold
swiller
after
mowing
i
also
just
remembered
that
my
friend
heather
has
a
chicken
and
dried
apricots
recipe
that
would
maybe
benefit
from
a
hint
of
this
beer
d
definately
a
drinkable
beer
i
am
suprised
as
i
dont
particularly
like
fruit
beers
but
on
a
hot
humid
day
like
today
it
was
perfect
drinkability
very
bland
flavorwise
and
this
beer
is
one
i
cant
see
drinking
again
this
may
appeal
to
nonbeer
drinkers
because
theres
not
too
much
beer
character
to
lose
this
would
probably
stand
up
to
being
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
courtesy
of
a
travelling
coworker
murky
golden
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
fizzy
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
nice
apricot
aroma
along
with
a
bit
of
malt
lightbodied
and
fruity
with
apricot
being
the
dominant
flavor
however
there
is
a
strange
sweetnessstaleness
in
the
background
that
ruins
it
somewhat
the
finish
is
fruity
wheaty
and
short
alright
in
some
respects
but
the
off
flavors
hurt
this
beer
too
much
this
pours
a
very
light
yellow
straw
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
apricots
and
bakers
yeast
along
with
a
strong
nut
aroma
the
smells
are
so
strong
that
they
have
to
be
artificial
if
you
sniff
this
for
any
length
of
time
it
can
even
get
alittle
sickning
its
not
bad
in
small
dosagesbut
i
dont
think
ive
ever
smelled
a
beer
as
strong
as
this
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
only
not
as
strong
this
is
all
apricot
nuts
and
bisquits
the
mf
is
light
with
the
strong
flavors
not
mixing
all
that
well
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
just
too
strong
if
ithaca
made
a
more
subdued
version
this
would
be
much
better
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
one
poured
a
dense
brightwhite
head
that
was
held
up
by
a
storm
of
carbonation
transparent
strawcolored
beer
holds
a
ton
of
bubbles
apricot
aroma
is
pretty
potent
and
almost
like
a
perfume
its
a
bit
much
and
a
little
artificial
to
me
apricot
is
mellow
and
subued
in
the
flavor
and
i
think
there
is
a
dash
of
coriander
in
there
as
well
i
think
i
might
taste
a
little
malt
or
in
this
case
wheat
but
im
not
really
sure
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
fluffy
rather
nice
its
apricoty
but
you
knew
that
the
only
things
id
change
would
be
to
make
the
apricot
flavor
a
little
more
naturalmellow
and
the
finish
much
crisper
but
those
are
my
opinions
a
very
drinkable
fruit
beer
a
perfect
light
summer
drink
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
a
good
head
that
quickly
dissipates
strong
apricot
nose
with
a
slight
whaety
undertone
a
bit
overdone
on
the
apricot
probably
a
bit
more
refreshing
in
the
summer
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
thick
a
finish
ok
on
the
drinkability
scale
but
dogfish
aprihop
is
abetter
choice
worthe
a
try
especially
in
warmer
weather
this
beer
pours
a
very
pale
clear
yellowish
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disapates
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
floral
with
strong
notes
of
apricot
and
a
bit
jammy
the
taste
definitely
apricot
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
some
wheat
notes
this
beer
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
complex
its
a
good
beer
i
might
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
such
a
light
beer
i
might
buy
some
again
sometime
but
its
nothing
that
will
be
on
my
mind
to
pick
up
pours
a
very
light
color
almost
watery
looking
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
but
dont
judge
a
book
by
the
cover
this
is
a
nice
lignt
beer
for
the
summer
the
fruity
taste
was
enjoyable
it
has
a
sour
apple
bite
to
it
if
your
looking
for
somthing
light
with
a
different
tastegive
it
shot
the
beer
poured
a
bland
yellow
with
hints
of
pink
and
orange
in
it
there
is
also
no
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
with
a
chemical
apricot
with
some
malts
in
there
the
taste
is
of
apricot
and
astrigency
way
too
sweet
lmost
like
a
dessert
wine
reisling
to
be
exact
only
carbinated
there
is
bitterness
in
the
end
but
it
is
more
like
rotted
fruit
bitter
than
hops
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
sharp
with
large
bubbles
and
a
dry
finish
not
a
pleasant
beer
in
my
book
pours
light
amber
not
much
lacing
but
a
crapload
of
effervescence
i
think
it
was
too
bubbly
smell
was
good
with
a
nice
whiff
of
apricots
along
with
light
flowery
hops
taste
followed
well
with
a
light
ipa
floweriness
some
wheats
and
solid
realtasting
apricots
dont
get
me
wrong
this
aint
no
9
but
its
certianly
a
nice
refreshing
option
moderate
mouthfeel
crisp
and
a
little
sticky
with
lots
of
bubbles
insanely
drinkable
its
not
for
me
but
a
go
if
you
like
the
really
sweet
brews
blechhkk
this
is
pretty
nasty
stuff
i
was
glad
to
see
something
somewhat
local
out
here
in
western
new
york
for
the
summer
and
jumped
at
the
chance
to
pick
up
a
mixed
12
of
ithica
4
different
beers
3
were
really
good
and
i
was
sort
of
skeptical
about
this
one
and
i
was
right
it
pretty
much
sucks
pours
a
yellowy
fizzy
mess
and
im
talking
soda
fizzy
not
your
average
beer
carbonation
smells
like
soda
too
sugary
and
fruity
way
too
fruity
not
a
nice
subtle
hint
like
in
some
fruit
beers
oh
god
after
another
few
sips
i
have
to
drop
that
taste
down
to
a
1
and
i
hate
to
do
it
because
their
other
beers
are
great
but
this
deserves
a
bashing
tastes
like
straight
up
juice
or
soda
hardly
any
recognizable
beer
qualities
no
hops
im
sure
theres
malt
in
there
and
hops
too
i
guess
but
theres
no
character
shining
through
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
this
and
i
never
pour
a
beer
down
the
drain
until
now
tastes
delicious
apricots
some
other
fruits
raspberry
and
orange
mostly
tastes
like
fruit
juice
but
its
spiked
i
think
i
could
turn
any
selfproclaimed
beer
hater
into
a
beer
lover
with
this
beer
it
just
tastes
deliciously
fruity
it
also
feels
great
lots
of
bubbles
nice
crisp
finish
crazy
drinkability
ive
never
emptied
my
glass
that
quickly
a
delicious
very
drinkable
beer
fellows
this
one
will
turn
your
girls
into
beer
drinkers
trust
me
a
5
in
enjoyability
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
medium
light
straw
with
not
much
head
or
lace
poor
head
retention
aroma
of
apricot
and
wheat
duh
but
more
so
of
the
sweet
apricot
taste
is
apricot
with
some
slight
wheat
malt
duh
again
finishes
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
overall
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
im
sur
it
tastes
pretty
good
on
a
hot
summers
day
an
ok
brew
but
not
much
to
write
home
about
bender
factor
the
perfect
way
to
finish
a
12
sampler
off
by
yourself
makes
you
think
that
you
are
getting
rehydrated
ordered
after
a
long
night
of
drinking
stouts
and
ipas
way
better
than
magic
9
which
is
a
weak
apricot
wheat
pursuing
blue
moon
ithaca
stands
alone
a
pretty
fun
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
based
on
its
strong
fruit
character
but
its
not
wildly
complex
well
suited
to
vary
ones
drinks
during
a
night
of
continuous
consumption
especially
with
its
light
and
smooth
texture
and
peppy
drinkability
the
only
non
macro
or
big
import
served
at
the
bar
at
belhurst
castle
so
i
gave
it
a
try
even
though
not
a
huge
fan
of
apricot
brewspoures
a
somewhat
hazy
straw
with
no
head
to
speak
of
poured
two
bottles
and
no
head
in
either
looked
flat
a
big
canned
apricot
aroma
going
on
like
a
few
others
noted
with
some
toasted
graininesstaste
is
like
sweeteded
apricots
and
and
toasted
malt
even
more
of
the
latter
in
the
finish
and
aftertastewent
down
quite
easy
not
bad
for
an
apricot
ale
have
had
better
i
let
my
wife
normally
drink
these
cloudy
golden
liquid
with
a
strong
artificialsmelling
apricot
aroma
the
apricot
smell
dominates
the
nose
and
not
much
else
comes
through
taste
is
slightly
grainy
without
the
wheatbeer
qualities
that
i
expected
its
a
very
soft
almost
watery
beer
with
essentially
no
aftertaste
this
is
a
beer
for
the
unadventurous
nonbeer
drinker
i
did
not
enjoy
it
first
imperial
pint
glass
pours
with
a
12
bright
white
head
which
fades
rather
quickly
and
minimal
lacing
clear
pale
straw
brew
with
a
strong
apricot
aroma
with
an
undercurrent
of
grainy
wheat
just
what
i
expected
which
is
always
nice
taste
is
quite
tartly
of
apricots
carried
by
the
wheat
body
light
as
it
is
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
average
but
for
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
know
im
not
the
biggest
fruit
beer
aficianado
anyways
but
give
me
a
good
one
and
ill
give
it
its
due
props
this
one
isnt
one
of
the
earthshakers
in
my
book
this
is
an
okay
brew
it
is
an
average
wheat
with
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
for
being
an
american
wheat
this
is
pretty
drinkable
obviously
a
beer
like
this
would
be
better
suited
for
the
summer
but
it
was
just
fine
with
my
orange
and
ginger
chicken
creation
in
the
dead
of
winter
its
flavored
but
at
least
the
flavoring
works
well
with
the
malt
drinkability
a
litle
too
malternative
for
me
needs
more
ale
character
probably
nice
well
chilled
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
for
every
day
but
definately
a
sweeter
summer
favorite
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
apricots
and
little
wheat
malt
the
taste
is
the
same
its
not
an
overpowering
apricot
taste
but
the
flavor
sticks
out
at
you
the
body
is
low
to
medium
its
a
drinker
especially
on
those
hot
summer
days
this
is
a
favorite
of
my
wife
but
shes
a
sucker
for
a
pale
fruit
beer
i
just
dont
care
for
wheat
beers
that
are
not
hazy
and
ringing
with
wheat
taste
and
aroma
fuller
bodied
than
most
wheats
im
typically
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
has
a
light
apricot
flavor
thats
not
overwhelming
pint
poured
into
glass
brown
body
very
slight
head
if
even
smell
is
like
those
laffy
taffy
banana
candies
taste
is
sharp
carbonation
sickly
sweet
artificial
tasting
banana
although
the
bottle
states
they
use
actual
bananas
not
saying
it
is
artificial
but
its
just
a
taste
to
me
then
toffee
and
some
dryness
but
very
little
slight
roastyness
but
not
much
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
will
not
buy
again
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
taste
was
immediately
of
banana
and
aftertaste
was
bicuity
pretty
spot
on
for
a
bready
beer
with
banana
flavor
not
my
cup
of
tea
though
again
wife
loved
it
just
love
it
i
love
bananas
already
so
yeah
haha
surprisingly
good
definitely
worse
beers
my
wife
loves
this
beer
cant
buy
a
6
pack
without
bringing
her
home
one
of
these
bad
boys
great
beer
id
drink
it
any
time
really
enjoyed
the
banana
flavor
of
this
was
good
even
after
warming
on
the
beach
for
a
bit
forgot
a
cooler
oops
i
could
taste
the
hint
of
banana
and
it
was
gooooood
awesome
beer
really
does
taste
just
like
banana
bread
very
good
looking
beer
smells
like
banana
with
notes
of
skunk
tastes
like
banana
bread
but
it
also
tastes
like
beer
which
is
nice
not
my
favourite
i
wouldnt
even
buy
it
again
but
its
a
very
interesting
experience
love
this
tastes
just
like
banana
bread
great
smell
very
smooth
pleasantly
surprised
i
think
that
the
most
important
aspect
of
note
with
this
beer
is
that
even
though
its
billed
as
a
banana
bread
beer
and
flavored
with
bananas
it
comes
across
very
similar
to
a
belgian
pale
ale
the
banana
comes
across
pretty
much
identically
to
belgian
yeast
not
as
hoppy
as
a
bpa
but
otherwise
very
similar
in
balance
my
only
knock
on
this
is
the
incredible
thinness
pours
with
a
large
white
head
has
a
very
clean
amber
color
has
an
actual
banana
bread
aroma
mixed
with
a
hoppy
aroma
initial
taste
is
of
banana
bread
immediately
followed
by
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
well
done
wells
well
done
medium
amber
color
with
short
lived
head
and
lace
deep
aroma
of
ripened
banana
with
a
backbone
of
biscuity
richness
the
banana
isnt
overbearing
in
the
taste
but
blends
well
with
the
slight
malty
base
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
with
a
buttery
texture
overall
its
a
pretty
balanced
brew
although
id
like
to
see
what
this
one
would
be
like
on
nitro
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
banana
pudding
smells
just
like
banana
bread
very
tasty
im
usually
skeptical
of
most
fruit
beers
and
im
not
a
big
fan
of
bananas
but
this
is
pretty
good
i
thought
it
tasted
more
like
oatmeal
with
bananas
but
nevertheless
it
lives
up
to
the
name
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
if
youre
into
something
different
and
refreshing
this
is
it
you
take
your
first
sip
and
its
beer
but
the
after
taste
is
absolute
banana
bread
goodness
very
surprising
great
beer
i
would
buy
again
its
a
gorgeous
rich
amber
color
when
poured
the
smell
is
almost
non
existent
with
just
a
faint
odor
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
rich
and
flavorful
light
carbonation
and
just
a
hint
of
banana
bread
smooth
finish
without
the
cloying
sweetness
ive
seen
in
other
fruit
type
beers
i
have
to
say
im
rather
surprised
by
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
its
delicious
and
satisfying
strange
to
see
such
experiments
from
british
brewery
but
this
one
is
nice
overall
the
aroma
and
taste
is
great
but
its
a
very
light
beer
missing
some
body
and
a
little
freshness
smells
a
lot
like
a
banana
dessert
beer
ehh
its
alright
i
mean
ive
had
better
but
then
again
for
what
this
beer
is
its
pretty
good
wow
very
good
beer
must
have
great
taste
not
hoppy
smells
great
exactly
what
you
want
from
a
flavoured
beer
tastes
strongly
of
bananas
which
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
exactly
what
should
be
expected
when
getting
a
flavored
beer
very
good
i
dont
know
why
i
like
this
but
i
do
surprisingly
enjoyable
could
use
a
tiny
bit
more
sweetness
but
it
stays
true
to
its
name
in
its
flavor
was
worried
it
would
just
taste
like
banana
flavoring
but
there
is
actually
a
wholesome
breadyness
to
it
as
well
interesting
but
good
banana
bread
taste
great
craft
beer
amazing
with
chocolate
stout
blend
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
pours
with
good
head
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
with
strong
nots
of
banana
the
taste
is
smooth
and
the
banana
are
obvious
on
the
palate
feel
is
slightly
carbonated
to
my
opinion
but
leaves
only
sweet
tones
for
after
taste
will
be
getting
this
again
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
to
begin
with
this
had
too
much
banana
but
i
cant
imagine
any
banana
flavor
being
a
positive
in
a
beer
has
a
strong
banana
taste
but
not
overwhelming
decent
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
heavier
with
a
better
head
the
beer
almost
has
to
be
taken
by
itself
not
even
a
pretzel
because
the
banana
flavor
is
so
delicate
i
enjoyed
trying
it
but
ill
not
likely
buy
again
newly
introduced
in
the
local
market
loved
this
beer
the
banana
flavour
made
it
special
i
simply
love
this
beer
its
like
drinking
dessert
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
with
a
head
that
fades
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
smells
exactly
how
it
sounds
banana
bread
and
british
ale
tastes
like
banana
bread
duh
the
banana
hits
you
up
front
and
the
finish
is
somewhat
lacking
i
find
the
banana
to
taste
a
lot
like
those
yellow
banana
popsicles
you
grow
up
eating
as
a
kid
i
wish
it
was
thicker
or
creamier
but
then
you
might
lose
some
accessability
decent
unique
brew
would
have
again
a
strong
smell
of
banana
bread
on
the
nose
that
was
slighty
more
subdued
on
the
palate
it
definitely
has
a
lingering
mouthfeel
that
emphasizes
the
banana
bread
experience
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
hint
of
banana
flavor
throughout
the
taste
is
robust
and
refreshing
this
beer
kicks
into
gear
right
away
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
and
would
purchase
it
again
for
myself
it
has
a
slight
bitter
taste
so
most
chicks
wouldnt
dig
it
however
i
dont
mind
this
flavor
one
bit
at
all
it
comes
in
a
500
ml
bottle
so
it
wont
leave
me
too
much
more
room
to
rate
any
other
beers
tonight
but
thats
ok
with
me
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
have
a
british
heritage
however
so
i
have
a
slightly
biased
opinion
very
week
taste
taste
like
a
flavored
miller
sorry
but
being
honest
great
beer
for
trying
something
new
this
beer
is
good
but
hard
to
get
through
an
entire
bottle
the
uniqueness
of
the
banana
taste
wares
off
and
it
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
great
i
picked
this
one
up
at
my
grocery
store
it
was
expensive
but
am
glad
i
didnt
let
the
price
keep
me
from
picking
it
up
this
beer
was
much
more
pleasant
than
most
people
discredited
it
for
this
beer
was
not
bitter
at
all
despite
other
comments
ive
read
about
this
one
i
did
experience
the
banana
flavor
both
in
the
taste
and
aroma
of
this
brew
it
has
a
very
smooth
well
balanced
satisfyingly
sweet
taste
and
best
of
all
it
didnt
leave
me
feeling
woozy
or
tipsy
at
least
not
yet
although
ive
had
even
better
fruit
beers
in
montana
this
is
certainly
of
the
better
ones
you
could
savor
the
current
ba
score
of
this
beer
at
the
time
of
my
review
is
79
a
pity
as
this
is
much
better
than
others
on
here
which
are
highly
overrated
as
far
as
the
aftertaste
goes
no
issues
as
of
yet
would
i
buy
this
english
brew
again
yes
indeed
its
a
winner
not
really
a
banana
bomb
but
it
is
easy
drinking
and
finishes
like
eating
a
banana
peel
just
the
right
amount
of
banana
flavour
lovely
banoffee
flavour
at
the
end
too
very
nice
jumping
jesus
this
is
top
5
for
me
this
beer
goes
great
with
grape
jolly
ranchers
and
a
newport
cigarette
i
can
drink
4packs
of
this
delicious
brew
all
day
every
day
and
i
do
bravo
wells
bravo
tried
on
tap
thin
body
very
weak

i
like
this
beer
may
be
sweet
for
some
but
i
dont
mind
that
one
bit
clever
well
made
worthwhile
maybe
not
2
in
a
row
but
ill
have
another
before
i
leave
the
bananas
in
the
nose
might
suggest
a
tradition
hefe
but
theres
enough
malt
and
sugar
underneath
to
say
otherwise
its
more
like
a
banana
popsicle
the
taste
is
lightly
toasted
malt
with
ripe
bananas
and
just
a
hint
of
light
caramel
in
the
finish
good
carbonation
give
the
body
a
nice
structure
to
enjoy
drinking
if
you
like
a
bananataste
profile
and
want
more
malt
and
body
than
a
hefeweizen
typically
provides
this
could
be
an
option
i
had
this
twice
when
i
went
to
buffalo
ny
thanks
to
a
friend
who
brought
it
from
michigan
since
i
live
in
puerto
rico
there
is
no
way
im
getting
this
beer
again
i
remember
the
beer
being
really
good
but
i
kinda
forgot
how
it
really
tasted
so
im
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
it
again
love
it
does
it
get
any
better
sweet
mellow
mart
profile
with
ripe
banana
flavor
laffy
taffy
some
bready
malt
notes
hey
im
not
proud
of
it
but
yeah
i
drank
it
and
it
tasted
like
banana
bread
go
figure
overall
2
93
i
would
call
this
a
wheat
lager
with
banana
notes
the
nose
is
the
strongest
part
of
this
banana
beer
it
doesnt
taste
like
banana
bread
and
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
craft
so
to
speak
its
a
notch
above
the
macros
and
its
pretty
decent
but
if
they
marketed
it
under
a
wheat
beer
with
banana
notes
and
put
it
in
12pack
cases
id
be
more
excited
about
it
and
probably
by
hype
id
give
it
a
3
5
or
more
if
youre
expecting
banana
bread
just
buy
a
loaf
instead
or
get
your
mama
to
make
you
one
its
probably
as
close
as
any
brewer
has
come
to
it
but
its
a
far
cry
from
a
delicious
treat
great
stuff
it
has
a
very
unique
taste
something
worth
trying
left
me
a
little
disappointed
tasted
too
much
like
extract
and
not
enough
fresh
banana
and
wholegrainy
goodness
surprisingly
good
but
much
like
banana
bread
itself
this
stuff
sits
like
a
stone
in
your
stomach
i
love
this
stuff
a
very
fresh
easy
to
drink
dessert
beer
pours
a
beautiful

ill
keep
it
simple
because
there
are
so
many

if
you
want
a
simple

for

and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
it
accomplishes
what
it
advertises
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
d
i
was
not
expecting
much
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
drink
this
early
in
the
day
or
at
dessert
with
sweet
food
and
id
turn
my
friends
on
to
it
as
a
change
of
pace
well
made
i
would
like
to
start
out
by
saying
this
beer
should
be
enjoyed
at
room
temperature
or
at
least
thats
where
i
got
the
best
flavor
profile
from
it
the
appearance
was
dark
amber
with
a
slightly
yellow
white
head
the
smell
was
full
of
bananas
and
nutmeg
the
taste
was
great
with
the
wheat
from
the
beer
and
the
banana
flavor
mixing
to
make
a
warm
banana
bread
flavor
for
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
also
very
nice
just
thick
enough
without
becoming
overwhelming
really
nice
twist
currently
drinking
a
glass
of
this
as
im
sitting
here
typing
i
had
this
beer
years
ago
but
decided
to
pick
up
another
bottle
since
i
see
it
all
the
time
the
beer
looks
really
good
in
the
glass
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
amount
of
head
on
top
the
smell
is
great
in
my
opinion
and
the
banana
stands
out
easily
as
far
as
the
taste
is
concerned
i
feel
like
something
is
missing
the
subtle
banana
flavoring
is
great
but
it
i
just
feel
like
theres
something
that
could
stand
out
more
that
just
isnt
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
that
readily
available
may
purchase
again
in
the
future
although
would
be
rare
this
is
a
once
and
while
type
of
beer
a
pretty
unique
brew
and
worth
trying
this
four
pack
of
11
2
ounce
bottles
was
a
bit
pricy
for
my
budget
at
over
10
bucks
but
oh
well
linear
simple
refreshing
and
tasty
smells
of
banana
bread
wells
really
knows
how
to
get
smell
down
feels
thick
in
my
mouth
and
tastes
sort
of
tangy
and
spicy
with
a
definite
aftertaste
of
banana
every
burp
tastes
like
banana
bread
excellent
beer
to
drink
with
comfort
food
like
a
grilled
cheese
sandwich
lower
apv
than
in
most
beer
id
consume
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
with
lunch
and
not
get
a
buzz
trying
the
wells
and
young
banana
bread
beer
at
the
pie
factory
in
florance
al
the
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
with
virtually
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
scent
is
definitely
banana
bread
the
taste
has
a
lighter
malt
base
with
banana
and
hints
of
spice
clove
the
m
outhfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
the
beer
hits
the
mark
as
far
as
taste
but
one
is
enough
for
me
enjoy
this
is
very
refreshing
and
it
taste
just
like
the
label
bananas
this
for
me
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
months
gives
you
that
tropical
feel
like
your
in
the
islands
anyway
it
is
a
light
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
not
overly
sweet
but
leaves
you
with
a
great
beerbanana
taste
that
lingers
if
you
like
banana
or
fruity
beers
add
this
to
your
list
seems
distinct
between
the
banana
bread
and
beer
flavour
at
first
banana
bread
in
all
its
rich
sweetness
then
turns
to
straight
up
beer
with
a
bite
at
the
finish
if
youre
a
fan
of
both
without
seeking
fusion
by
all
means
give
it
a
go
to
judge
for
yourself
for
me
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
not
something
id
list
as
a
regular
item
on
my
brew
menu
especially
for
the
price
for
the
price
of
six
others
i
only
get
four
but
such
is
the
way
for
the
adventurous
taster
pours
a
clear
amberorange
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
aromas
of
banana
scented
sunscreen
but
not
in
a
bad
way
actually
pleasant
ha
taste
begins
with
a
little
nuttiness
then
some
sweetbread
followed
by
banana
candy
flavor
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
overall
an
ok
beer
but
the
banana
flavoring
is
a
bit
too
artificial
tasting
to
me
id
rather
just
have
a
banana
forward
hefeweizen
if
i
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
bananas
very
thin
and
watery
looking
brew
light
metallic
bronze
color
with
thin
head
smells
decent
banana
runts
for
sure
the
taste
follows
the
nose
sweet
banana
like
the
candy
banana
runts
there
just
isnt
much
to
this
one
its
thin
and
lacking
complexity
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
initial
aroma
and
flavor
is
banana
runts
after
some
time
it
mellows
out
to
a
reasonable
banana
presence
but
the
bread
part
is
a
bit
lacking
would
be
nice
if
this
had
a
bit
more
of
a
malt
backbone
to
stand
up
to
the
banana
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
nuttiness
would
probably
complement
it
nicely
still
its
pretty
drinkable
once
the
artificialseeming
aroma
fades
a
decent
beer
for
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
unusual
o
if
this
tasted
like
it
smells
this
would
be
a
great
beer
but
i
feel
it
is
average
at
best
it
is
drinkable
and
fairly
enjoyable
but
could
be
much
better
i
get
the
banana
bread
thing
but
the
flavors
are
weak
okay
if
not
close
to
average
overall
wish
this
beer
had
more
depth
and
flavor
too
crisp
and
clean
but
its
worth
picking
up
to
try
definitely
a
good
beer
just
wish
it
was
an
outstanding
beer
o
though
the
beer
has
notsogood
ratings
i
like
it
a
lot
its
a
solid
brew
that
is
good
for
just
relaxing
and
enjoying
a
nice
flavor
this
beers
had
a
good
rep
in
the
beer
world
and
there
arent
many
banana
beers
out
there
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
a
wellmade
pretty
wellbalanced
beer
overall
the
banananess
tastes
and
smells
a
bit
artificial
to
me
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
if
youre
expecting
a
fresh
banana
experience
youll
be
a
bit
disappointed
not
overly
sweet
so
you
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
of
them
without
palate
fatigue
o
it
would
be
easy
to
fall
short
or
go
overboard
with
a
liquid
recreation
of
banana
bread
but
this
one
hits
that
inbetween
perfectly
not
a
beer
for
reinheitsgebotfollowers
but
for
beer
or
baking
enthusiasts
this
is
highly
recommended
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
around
the
top
of
the
beer
along
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
when
first
opened
you
can
smell
the
bananas
with
malt
very
pleasant
the
taste
would
be
expected
as
with
the
smell
bananas
and
yeastmalt
hense
the
name
a
different
beer
that
is
tasty
and
not
bitter
as
well
as
a
good
aftertaste
oslightly
let
down
by
the
sublteness
of
the
flavour
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
not
sure
what
else
you
would
have
with
it
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
not
sure
if
i
would
drink
again
overall
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
in
a
big
way
the
fruity
banana
flavor
is
not
cloying
at
all
and
the
toasty
malts
are
in
perfect
harmony
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
all
the
time
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
very
good
for
a
flavored
beer
you
can
actually
taste
the
bananas
but
not
in
an
overwhelming
way
okay
listen
this
is
a
beer
for
a
specific
purpose
youve
heard
of
dessert
wines
this
is
a
dessert
complimenting
beer
it
smells
very
much
as
advertised
it
tastes
they
way
you
would
imagine
it
goes
well
with
any
icecream
tart
fruit
or
pie
dessert
dish
this
is
not
your
during
the
game
or
social
outing
beer
but
if
you
utilize
this
beer
with
a
dessert
dish
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
by
any
means
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
more
malty
to
really
harness
the
sweetness
of
banana
bread
copper
in
color
with
a
small
one
to
two
finger
head
which
breaks
rather
quickly
leaving
a
very
thin
cap
and
some
lacing
the
first
smell
one
gets
is
unsurprisingly
sweet
ripe
bananas
there
really
isnt
much
more
that
be
picked
up
because
the
banana
smell
is
so
strong
the
first
taste
you
get
is
the
sweet
banana
as
well
but
then
it
is
followed
by
the
malt
and
hops
that
one
would
expect
to
get
from
a
british
bitter
this
beer
had
medium
carbonation
and
a
thin
or
light
feel
i
would
have
expected
it
to
be
heavier
but
was
surprised
at
how
light
it
was
my
biggest
issue
with
this
beer
is
an
associative
one
the
smell
and
initial
taste
remind
me
of
mr
freezee
ice
pops
for
americans
think
otter
pops
once
i
got
past
that
i
did
enjoy
the
beer
o
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
its
neat
to
revisit
every
once
in
a
while
got
this
particular
bottle
for
free
just
to
remember
that
there
is
a
beer
out
there
that
tastes
exactly
like
banana
bread
this
beer
smells
exactly
like
banana
bread
unfortunately
the
taste
doesnt
match
the
intensity
of
the
smell
most
of
the
flavors
are
only
slightly
detectable
a
little
malty
and
the
banana
taste
isnt
very
noticeable
until
the
aftertaste
still
this
is
a
crisp
and
very
drinkable
beer
was
really
excited
to
give
this
a
try
as
i
love
the
smell
and
taste
of
bananas
read
the
label
and
noticed
that
this
is
the
same
company
that
produces
the
double
chocolate
stout
hmmmm
i
was
disappointed
in
that
one
would
the
same
apply
here
meaning
would
i
be
let
down
by
the
promise
of
flavor
popped
a
bottle
in
the
fridge
and
poured
it
into
a
beer
glass
nice
2
finger
head
that
has
some
nice
lacing
as
the
head
dissipates
i
noticed
the
foam
keeps
throughout
and
never
totally
disappears
the
color
is
a
nice
flat
blondish
orange
clear
looking
has
a
faint
smell
of
bananas
that
is
artificial
i
wish
the
smell
was
more
pure
the
taste
has
a
very
faint
sweetness
to
it
and
the
fake
banana
flavor
comes
through
at
the
finish
and
lingers
a
bit
the
beer
itself
has
no
body
and
is
quite
thin
and
watery
what
happened
to
the
liquid
bread
they
were
talking
about
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
i
could
probably
have
2
bottles
easily
but
i
was
disappointed
in
the
overall
taste
when
i
drink
a
flavored
beer
i
want
it
to
taste
like
what
it
is
advertised
towards
the
end
i
added
some
dekuyper
creme
de
banana
just
for
kicks
and
the
taste
elevated
to
a
new
level
granted
it
was
still
fake
the
sweetness
and
the
banana
flavor
was
enhanced
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
women
my
wife
liked
the
taste
i
liked
it
ok
just
wished
it
was
more
true
and
flavorful
yeah
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
have
you
ever
tasted
any
other
like
it
strong
banana
nut
smell
and
upfront
taste
great
dessert
beer
for
special
occasions
something
different
and
fun
every
day
nope
i
wouldnt
drink
a
guinness
every
day
either
i
bought
it
just
for
fun
and
that
is
what
i
got
great
experience
all
around
the
only
thing
that
would
make
it
better
is
if
it
were
served
with
a
warm
slice
of
its
namesake
ps
following
a
recipe
on
the
internet
i
mixed
a
second
bottle
of
this
offering
with
some
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
probably
my
favorite
sweet
stout
the
resulting
blend
was
tasty
but
both
the
banana
and
chocolate
flavors
were
too
muted
to
make
for
a
delicious
desert
concoction
as
a
beer
it
tasted
like
a
thin
stout
interesting
but
not
worth
repeating
mouthfeel
heavy
for
a
fruit
beer
drinks
like
an
ale
and
less
like
a
cooler
overall
this
is
pretty
poor
stuff
the
banana
is
a
gimmick
and
no
more
and
it
doesnt
work
with
the
other
characters
of
the
beer
at
all
it
certainly
doesnt
live
up
to
its
moniker
a
concept
i
can
believe
would
actually
make
a
rather
tasty
brew
overall
it
needed
to
be
richer
and
sweeter
the
banana
is
there
but
easily
overcome
by
the
esb
nature
of
the
beer
the
body
is
about
medium
a
little
bit
of
a
mineral
edge
as
it
translates
into
the
feel
its
even
slightly
dry
as
that
herbal
hint
creeps
into
the
finish
crisp
and
otherwise
smooth
it
goes
down
prety
well
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
love
bananas
so
this
might
be
why
but
it
has
the
perfect
color
like
a
orangish
darkish
copper
and
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
taste
this
is
a
beer
i
will
keep
around
for
a
while
it
smells
very
fresh
and
has
low
carbonation
this
one
scores
to
be
in
my
top
5
favorite
beers
im
not
a
beer
snob
at
all
but
i
just
say
no
to
this
beer
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
but
i
dont
drink
it
as
often
as
i
would
like
so
when
i
do
it
is
a
real
treat
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
are
incredible
it
is
a
perfect
blend
of
beer
banana
and
spices
and
has
perfect
carbonation
highly
recommended
give
it
a
try
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
and
it
seem
its
to
go
down
hill
the
more
i
have
it
with
that
said
it
was
fantastic
the
first
four
pack
i
had
i
will
continue
to
buy
it
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
it
but
will
not
buy
any
to
have
on
hand
overall
it
is
worth
a
try
i
like
bananas
i
like
banana
bread
i
love
beer
will
they
fuck
this
up
surprisingly
no
this
beer
pours
a
copper
colour
with
a
thick
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
lasts
smells
of
banana
pudding
vanilla
bready
malts
and
just
a
faint
hint
of
pine
taste
starts
out
like
banana
bread
big
banana
flavours
with
some
malt
backbone
middle
has
a
vanilla
and
pine
flavour
added
in
finishes
like
banana
taffy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinkable
and
dry
overall
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
o
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
if
you
drink
it
cold
it
might
not
have
much
to
offer
but
the
moment
it
starts
warming
up
you
can
definitely
get
more
flavors
from
the
beer
i
would
have
it
again
d
a
beer
that
would
be
better
as
a
liquor
overall
this
is
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
it
is
very
definitely
banana
bread
based
but
fortunately
it
never
strays
close
to
being
gimmicky
and
holds
up
as
a
reasonable
beer
on
its
own
now
if
only
they
released
a
banana
bread
stout
a
unique
beer
that
certainly
follows
through
on
the
promise
its
name
makes
i
went
into
it
with
fairly
low
expectations
but
the
banana
blends
well
with
the
malts
and
is
not
overwhelming
you
can
definitely
smell
banana
bread
really
interesting
and
everybody
at
our
table
had
to
try
it
it
has
really
good
color
the
taste
is
more
on
the
sweeter
side
one
negative
for
me
is
that
this
beer
felt
thin
i
guess
since
i
like
stouts
i
prefer
full
bodied
beers
o
not
something
i
will
rant
and
rave
about
but
definitely
something
i
will
gave
again
in
the
future
overall
amazing
brew
i
am
a
sucker
for
anything
banana
and
this
really
did
the
trick
would
recommend
to
banana
fans
and
those
who
have
a
sweet
tooth
otherwise
it
might
just
join
the
ranks
of
fruit
beers
that
most
beer
drinkers
dont
enjoy
overall
if
you
like
banana
bread
bananas
or
just
sweet
beer
give
it
a
try
i
am
a
big
fan

abv
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
i
was
a
bit
tipsy
but
really
surprised
how
well
this
tasted
like
banana
bread
i
wasnt
able
to
sense
any
bitterness
or
bad
aftertaste
with
a
fruit
flavored
beer
it
likely
either
has
a
bad
aftertaste
or
such
a
strong
flavor
that
youd
only
be
able
to
handle
one
without
throwingup
this
one
would
be
able
to
be
consumed
in
a
6pack
the
taste
was
not
excessively
strong
and
neither
unsatisfying
to
the
way
it
settles
in
the
stomach
i
did
like
this
and
would
like
to
try
again
as
one
of
my
first
beers
to
be
able
to
truly
sense
any
subtle
hints
of
dissatisfaction
i
liked
and
would
buy
again
a
good
choice
for
the
fruit
flavored
style
the
appetence
could
improve
but
that
is
not
as
big
a
deal
as
the
taste
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
worth
a
try
overall
a
pretty
good
and
very
available
fruit
beer
the
bananas
are
the
star
and
make
this
worth
worth
trying
clear
yellowamber
pour
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
exactly
what
one
would
expect
banana
bread
i
was
expecting
just
bananas
but
they
nailed
the
bread
part
as
well
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
really
nice
surprising
spoton
banana
bread
flavor
not
artificial
at
all
and
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
adds
a
nice
twist
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
balance
and
none
of
the
artificial
aftertaste
i
had
expected
and
its
not
sweet
and
syrupy
but
very
sessionable
overall
this
was
very
surprising
yeah
its
kind
of
a
novelty
but
its
a
well
made
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
final
thoughts
its
a
good
beer
and
an
interesting
experience
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
something
youd
drink
regularly
i
actually
had
it
for
breakfast
one
day
anyways
like
a
broken
record
its
as
advertised
if
beer
is
liquid
bread
you
are
going
to
get
mild
liquid
banana
bread
banana
bread
and
beer
holy
mackerel
what
could
be
better
well
it
wasnt
stupendous
but
it
was
sure
good
from
the
bottle
the
beer
is
an
appealing
dark
amber
pouring
a
weak
head
but
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
distinctly
banana
i
dont
smell
much
of
bread
but
definitely
banana
which
is
a
pet
peeve
of
mine
if
you
advertise
it
one
way
it
better
be
that
way
oh
well
thats
advertisement
for
you
the
beer
however
was
bold
and
refreshing
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
but
still
good
i
really
did
enjoy
it
a
great
mixture
of
malt
and
banana
that
mixed
perfectly
overall
it
wasnt
banana
bread
but
it
was
a
good
banana
flavored
beer
that
i
think
many
will
like
overall
i
would
say
this
is
an
excellent
beer
fans
of
banana
flavor
should
definitely
seek
this
out
i
do
recommend
this
beer
to
people
and
is
the
perfect
beer
to
sit
around
with
and
you
could
drink
it
for
hours
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
light
bubbles
a
thin
loose
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
without
lacing
the
nose
has
subtle
but
detectable
notes
of
ripe
bananabread
seemingly
nonartificial
smelling
and
a
touch
of
yeast
and
vanilla
extract
the
banana
in
the
nose
doesnt
fully
translate
into
the
beers
flavor
profile
which
is
more
of
a
bitter
amber
ale
than
anything
but
does
leave
traces
of
lingering
green
banana
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thin
and
lightbodied
sessionable
effervescent
slightly
bitter
and
leaves
a
bittersweet
banana
aftertaste
id
say
this
is
definitely
not
what
id
expected
and
could
use
a
bit
more
body
yeast
and
sweetness
to
really
amplify
what
is
a
spot
on
nonartificial
banana
nose
and
taste
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
edit
i
forgot
to
mention
that
i
hate
the
idea
of
pouring
a
beer
down
the
drain
i
just
dont
see
the
point
in
being
wasteful
i
gave
this
one
a
solid
go
and
drank
about
80
but
that
last
bit
was
my
first
drainpour
ever
its
banana
bred
beer
in
a
glass
nothing
more
either
you
like
it
or
hate
i
think
its
perfect
taste
just
like
a
banana
bread
i
giggle
its
so
good
if
you
like
banna
bread
drink
tis
beer
nothing
more
to
say
they
capture
wht
they
were
going
for
nothing
needs
to
be
said
enjoy
the
berr
yes
or
no
i
love
it
so
enjoy
take
this
beer
for
what
it
is
if
your
looking
for
something
that
tastes
like
beer
then
you
should
just
walk
on
by
this
one
but
if
you
appreciate
how
they
came
about
to
make
a
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
banana
bread
then
this
is
the
one
for
you
it
is
unreal
how
they
did
this
great
job
guys
o
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
this
beer
is
great
for
a
flavored
beer
sweet
hints
of
banana
blended
surprisingly
good
while
still
maintaining
a
classic
malty
beer
taste
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
if
you
like
sweet
beers
and
bananas
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
overall
try
it
not
bad
not
amazing
but
enjoyable
i
ended
up
making
banana
bread
with
most
of
the
beer
which
was
great
i
wouldnt
normally
drink
it
because
of
its
confusing
flavor
the
aroma
is
nice
at
least
i
dont
intend
to
repeat
this
beers
for
its
not
feel
special
to
me
overall
well
the
fruitvegetable
beer
style
in
general
tends
to
be
a
little
different
in
my
opinion
but
certainly
worth
a
go
round
cant
say
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
any
time
soon
overall
a
mellow
easy
going
beer
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
very
fun
beer
o
good
looking
brew
not
necessarily
the
color
of
banana
bread
smell
is
alright
but
artificial
at
times
not
really
imitating
a
slice
of
banana
bread
i
do
appreciate
that
the
beer
has
beer
quality
but
i
think
it
could
work
better
with
a
smootherchewier
feel
and
a
touch
more
sweetness
wells
banana
bread
beer
comes
across
as
a
bit
kitchy
and
falls
short
in
terms
of
overall
appeal
i
love
bananas
and
beer
but
the
melding
of
both
in
this
offering
did
not
work
well
o
immediately
i
thought
wow
this
is
really
surprising
good
but
the
more
is
sipped
the
more
i
realized
this
has
the
nose
of
a
laffy
taffee
and
tastes
a
bit
artificial
in
their
defense
the
taste
isnt
too
overly
ripetoo
sweet
banana
almost
a
touch
bitter
which
is
very
nice
spices
pepper
and
sweetness
are
really
balanced
but
the
artificialness
is
something
i
couldnt
get
over
or
this
would
have
gotten
higher
ratings
o
a
really
nice
beer
but
more
of
a
rare
occasion
buy
when
your
feeling
frisky
not
something
i
would
stock
up
on
for
any
occasion
a
reasonably
decent
and
drinkable
ale
reminiscent
of
other
english
and
scotch
styles
with
the
added
gimmick
of
surprisingly
analogous
banana
bread
flavors
worth
a
try
might
even
have
it
again
but
it
isnt
spectacular
just
pretty
good
overy
very
average
beer
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
because
the
idea
is
unique
the
artificial
smell
and
taste
is
entirely
too
overpowering
that
being
said
id
still
try
this
beer
because
it
is
a
neat
idea
however
only
buy
one
i
mention
the
sorbetpalate
cleanser
concept
because
i
followed
the
banana
bread
beer
with
a
ballast
point
sculpin
ipa
my
third
bottle
of
the
six
pack
and
found
myself
completely
blown
away
with
the
flavor
of
the
sculpin
ipa
whereas
the
first
two
samples
of
that
same
six
pack
struck
me
as
merely
average
could
it
be
that
the
banana
bread
beer
sets
the
palate
up
for
a
new
beer
flavor
based
on
my
experience
i
say
it
does
worth
a
try
just
for
the
uniqueness
alone
mouth
feel
is
really
thin
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
bit
less
enjoyable
would
have
been
better
a
little
heartier
and
south
a
more
lingering
flavor
final
thoughts
wells
banana
bread
beer
delivers
on
its
promise
but
nothing
more
its
a
decent
gimmick
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
no
im
not
seeking
it
out
i
own
a
bar
in
wisconsin
we
specialize
in
micros
and
imports
been
doing
it
as
a
profession
for
7yrs
i
am
not
a
beer
expert
but
i
know
what
i
like
i
like
this
beer
i
drink
a
lot
of
jameson
when
i
want
to
ease
off
of
drinking
or
have
a
relaxed
drinking
engagement
this
beer
is
a
go
to
very
drinkable
and
smooth
not
filling
can
have
3
or
4
in
a
row
and
its
not
overwhelming
like
a
pilsner
with
a
banana
boost
not
sweet
banana
flavor
its
more
savory
we
do
joke
and
say
who
put
the
banana
laffy
taffy
in
my
beer
hint
of
that
flavor
it
is
a
must
try
not
steering
you
wrong
to
the
expert
and
the
green
horns
enjoy
this
very
unexpected
beer
have
a
good
taste
and
a
very
good
color
the
taste
and
smell
obviously
remember
us
a
banana
beer
despite
its
very
unusual
the
beer
is
very
good
in
overall
it
has
a
poor
neck
but
a
correct
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
surprising
you
at
all
if
you
could
i
recommend
you
to
drink
it
even
for
a
new
experience
on

a

becomes

with
a
very
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
a

for
this
beer
simple
but
pleasant

a
bit
on
the
thin

slight
diacetyl
slickness
if
you
like
the
taste
and
aroma
of
bananas
then
youll
probably
like
the
scent
and
flavour
of
this
beer
however
it
could
be
much
better
with
a
more
substantial
mouthfeel
overall
drinkability
quite
good
as
a
slushy
pours
a
medium
amber
brown
thin

no
retention
nice
looking

smells
of
ripe
bananas
fresh
walnuts
bready
malts
and
sugary
sweetness
i
hope
this
isnt
too
overly
sweet
actually
pretty
well
balanced
not
sickly
sweet
but
definitely
leaning
that
direction
nice
banana
flavor
not
much
hop
bitterness
to
speak
of
but
definitely
heavy
on
the
malty
caramel
bready
side
mouthfeel
is
thin
light
and
slick
nice
consistency
and
i
like
the
low
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
lives
up
to
my
expectations
thinner
medium
body
decent
carbonation
watery
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
basically
a
watered
down
fauxsweet
banana
bread
profile
with
some
borderlineadjunct
tendencies
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
my
partner
wishes
his
car
perpetually
smelled
like
this
beer
notes
of
vanilla
banana
bubblegum
and
the
initial
sweetness
is
followed
by
an
equal
amount
of
bitterness
more
banana
than
bread
maybe
a
hint
more
carbonation
than
necessary
it
tastes
as
if
they
took
your
favorite
beer
and
infused
it
with
banana
shaped
and
flavored
candy
we
expected
this
to
be
darker
and
denser
but
overall
not
bad
overall
not
really
a
great
attempt
due
to
unbalance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
o
probably
good
as
a
gateway
beer
to
explore
new
flavors
but
this
one
falls
short
in
a
lot
of
areas
i
liked
this
ale
and
will
drink
it
again
but
think
it
could
have
been
much
more
overall
just
a
delicious
fun
beer
why
does
it
have
an
avg
score
of
79
do
beer

really

a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
fun
just
buying
the
beer
for
the
name
and
exciting
to
have
something
different
but
sadly
not
something
i
may
buy
again
for
personal
use
maybe
i
would
think
differently
about
it
if
it
was
a
hot
summer
day
sitting
by
the
camper
or
right
after
i
mowed
the
yard
but
not
feeling
it
mid
december
its
light
and
crisp
like
a
session
beer
but
not
sure
if
i
could
hang
with
that
flavor
for
knocking
back
a
few
passable
but
still
a
novelty
beer
to
my
mind
or
an
attempt
to
cheat
another
more
interesting
style
overall
a
fun
and
approachable
beer
the
banana
taste
is
bold
and
clear
and
this
dominance
might
be
enough
to
turn
off
drinkers
who
like
to
play
with
layers
of
complexity
as
they
drink
still
though
this
is
probably
worth
a
try
if
the
concept
of
a
banana
bread
beer
is
enough
to
get
you
interested
a
solid
banana
beer
the
banana
isnt
overwhelming
and
i
wish
i
had
bought
another
one
overall
a
good
beer
especially
for
a
fruit
beer
would
recommend
to
try
and
will
probably
get
again
not
sure
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
but
as
a
novelty
and
change
of
pace
its
fun
and
a
good
time
o
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
that
ive
found
its
quite
the
oddity
but
i
have
to
say
that
it
was
worth
satisftying
my
curiosity
there
are
some
pretty
bad
fruit
beers
out
there
and
i
dont
feel
that
this
is
one
of
them
o
it
is
what
it
is
banana
beer
theres
a
definite
appeal
here
though
i
cant
say
i
really
enjoy
this
personally
id
much
rather
have
a
hefeweizen
with
a
more
natural
banana
ester
character
over
this
one
any
day
this
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
who
heard
i
liked
craft
beer
she
just
picked
a
bunch
of
stuff
from
the
craft
beer
section
and
this
ended
up
in
the
bunch
in
her
defense
the
other
stuff
included
some
dogfish
head
stuff
a
dead
guy
from
rogue
and
some
other
good
stuff
anyway
id
heard
this
was
bad
and
it
was
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
not
good
i
dont
think
it
was
the
execution
of
the
beer
but
the
concept
i
hate
pretty
much
anything
banana
flavored
except
bananas
themselves
and
banana
bread
i
rank
this
somewhere
between
banana
flavored
candy
and
real
banana
bread
mostly
i
couldnt
handle
the
smell
smelled
like
a
banana
peel
that
had
been
left
in
a
hot
car
all
day
it
tasted
okish
but
the
smell
was
always
there
theres
that
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
o
it
is
definitely
interesting
the
banana
taste
is
definitely
present
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
i
like
it
but
will
likely
only
buy
it
on
occasion
when
craving
something
very
different
o
not
bad
as
a
novelty
dont
think
this
would
be
very
sessionable
it
was
definitely
the
unique
brew
i
was
looking
the
alcohol
content
plays
a
subtle
role
in
the
taste
with
that
hint
of
banana
i
might
try
this
again
sometime
but
dont
see
this
being
heavy
in
my
rotation
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
really
did
have
an
unusual
flavor
of
banana
nut
bread
the
beer
really
had
a
crisp
and
small
flavor
profile
that
was
more
malt
forward
than
hoppy
but
the
fruit
portion
was
unusually
perfect
when
compared
to
banana
bread
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
but
for
an
after
dinner
drink
or
a
drink
to
break
away
from
the
norm
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
i
was
surprised
that
i
did
like
this
as
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
up
my
alley
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
nor
would
i
say
it
was
a
great
beer
or
worth
buying
if
i
ever
found
it
in
bottles
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
at
a
bar
with
some
friends
this
was
a
very
good
beer
the
pour
was
perfect
and
the
head
was
great
the
color
is
almost
a
carameloak
color
and
the
smell
is
that
of
bananas
caramel
sugar
and
nuts
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
this
beer
will
leave
you
wanting
more
the
first
sip
is
full
of
banana
flavor
i
would
reccomend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
wanted
something
different
taste
differs
a
bit
banana
is
not
as
present
as
in
the
aroma
where
malt
sweetness
in
predominant
medium
bitterness
though
banana
comes
back
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
have
had
this
on
my
wishlist
for
awhile
now
and
i
am
very
glad
i
found
it
since
i
enjoy
banana
bread
i
think
this
beer
is
delicious
this
beer
delivers
on
the
promise
of
its
name
check
it
out
any
way
you
can
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
especially
for
a
fruit
beer
which
i
am
not
usually
a
huge
far
of
it
smells
weakly
like
banana
bread
but
this
comes
out
a
lot
better
in
the
flovor
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
beer
and
the
banana
no
problems
in
appearance
and
it
isnt
too
sweet
so
that
it
is
drinkable
rjt
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
artificial
banana
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
watery
flavor
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
and
not
a
good
example
of
a
fruit
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
very
average
offering
i
think
ill
stick
to
hefes
for
my
banana
fix
in
ale
m
perfect
holy
crap
this
is
a
banana
moonpie
somehow
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
flavor
of
saltwater
taffy
this
should
be
tried
at
least
once
by
every
beer
drinker
even
if
never
again
it
would
be
a
stretch
for
me
to
finish
a
full
glass
of
this
much
less
a
second
that
being
said
i
feel
that
if
you
ever
loved
sweets
in
your
childhood
you
will
love
at
least
one
sample
of
this
beer
fing
banana
bread
this
s
is
bananas
b
a
n
a
n
a
s
great
specialty
beer
while
not
my
kind
of
beer
i
would
certainly
consider
buting
again
if
in
the
mood
for
some
liquid
dessert
just
goes
to
show
that
sweet
done
right
can
still
please
a
hophead
i
dont
know
if
id
exactly
make
tracks
to
go
out
and
seek
this
again
but
if
youre
curious
if
bananas
and
beer
go
together
well
it
turns
out
they
can
kinda
sorta
someone
do
a
banana
bread
porter
500
ml
bottle
copper
coloured
beer
smells
like
sweet
baking
banana
bread
warm
clove
spice
baked
bananas
bready
and
nutty
as
well
noticeable
spicy
hop
aroma
as
well
flavour
is
sweet
doughy
and
bready
banana
tastes
real
no
candyish
character
a
wellbalanced
and
surprisingly
tasty
beer
i
dont
think
id
want
to
make
a
session
out
of
it
but
for
a
change
its
pretty
good
not
a
bad
brew
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessionable
if
they
sold
it
in
sixpacks
just
wish
the
banana
bread
taste
was
a
bit
more
apparent
because
its
quite
good
when
you
finally
taste
it
o
despite
what
everyone
else
has
said
if
youre
a
fan
of
banana
bread
this
beer
is
up
your
alley
its
light
refreshing
easy
going
and
with
great
taste
try
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
the
taste
was
even
more
spot
on
i
was
skeptical
to
drop
the
money
on
this
beer
at
first
but
curiosity
got
the
best
of
me
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
similarity
between
banana
bread
and
this
brew
much
more
than
just
a
banana
flavor
which
is
what
i
originally
predicted
the
sweetroasted
after
taste
leaves
you
wanting
more
if
you
ask
me
the
only
tragic
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
11
2
oz
bottle
i
want
those
extra
8
damn
it
overall
a
beer
i
was
expecting
to
drink
and
soon
forget
but
i
will
remember
this
beer
as
being
very
subtle
but
still
pronounced
natural
flavors
win
no
gimmicks
here
i
couldnt
enjoy
more
than
a
bottle
every
now
and
then
though
a
beer
begging
to
be
paired
with
possibly
a
flourless
chocolate
cake
or
bananas
foster
not
as
fruity
as
i
was
expecting
toasted
walnuts
some
unexpected
pilslike
hop
notes
some
banana
not
too
sweet
pretty
unique
not
thirsty
for
a
second
one
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
have
had
this
on
my
wishlist
for
awhile
now
and
i
am
very
glad
i
found
it
as
a
lover
of
banana
bread
i
think
this
beer
is
delicious
i
hope
it
stays
a
regular
at
my
local
liquor
store
cheers
lampertland
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
it
has
a
long
lasting
flavour
profile
and
the
hops
balanced
the
malt
even
though
you
get
lots
of
banana
this
is
something
that
you
can
have
from
time
to
time
and
enjoy
may
actually
go
well
with
breakfast
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
some
very
light
lacing
aroma
of
banana
notes
is
quite
strong
with
light
sweet
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
banana
flavours
with
some
sweet
notes
body
is
a
bit
light
with
medium
carbonation
interesting
at
first
but
the
aroma
gets
to
be
a
bit
too
much
after
a
while
o
very
nice
definately
one
to
drink
again
but
i
like
bananas
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
until
that
bitter
and
metallic
taste
comes
into
play
they
certainly
got
the
banana
bread
part
right
in
the
aroma
and
at
the
start
of
the
flavor
so
they
definitely
get
points
for
that
the
overall
drinkability
and
enjoyability
of
the
beer
suffers
due
to
the
odd
finish
all
in
all
this
is
an
average
fruit
beer
that
was
nice
to
try
but
i
probably
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
overall
im
quite
impressed
with
this
banana
bread
beer
from
wells
the
flavour
and
aroma
is
spot
onnot
overdone
at
all
but
definitely
powerful
enough
to
let
you
know
that
the
star
of
this
beer
is
invariably
the
banana
poured
from
their
1
pint
9
oz
bottle
found
at
the
local
wegmans
pours
a
nice
amber
color
distinct
banana
smell
they
certainly
got
the
banana
bread
taste
down
here
nice
malty
finish
typical
english
ale
if
flavored
beer
is
thing
or
even
just
occasionally
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
plus
at
5
2
alcohol
a
good
kick
with
the
flavor
light
and
whispy
mouthfeel
banana
flavor
throughout
lightly
toasted
grain
finishes
like
eating
a
piece
of
banana
bread
although
brewed
with
real
bananas
some
of
the
banana
flavoring
seems
artificial
also
for
a
beer
called
banana
bread
i
thought
there
wouldve
been
some
more
bready
malt
flavor
along
with
a
fuller
mouthfeel
great
if
you
like
bananas
but
otherwise
doesnt
live
up
to
expectations
an
aptly
named
beer
for
people
who
like
banana
bread
overall
very
good
brew
interesting
and
good
taste
o
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
quite
easy
to
put
a
few
away
on
a
summer
night
o
its
is
a
good
beer
but
not
for
me
if
you
like
banana
bread
however
you
should
love
it
final
grade
3
4
an
acceptable
bminus
grade
in
academic
terms
fruit
beers
have
never
really
been
my
thing
but
wells
banana
bread
beer
is
an
enjoyable
example
that
i
might
just
pick
up
again
some
time
fans
of
banana
bread
are
unlikely
to
be
disappointed
because
this
beer
really
does
emulate
its
flavour
surprisingly
well
not
my
favourite
wells
young
offering
by
a
longshot
but
still
a
respectable
brew
that
is
worth
at
least
one
try
an
interesting
effort
the
description
of
liquid
banana
bread
is
entirely
justified
plenty
of
banana
on
display
and
very
sweet
the
banana
is
very
intense
in
the
aroma
but
balanced
by
a
more
obvious
malt
character
in
the
flavour
the
mouthfeel
is
too
watery
and
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
relatively
strong
taste
overall
it
goes
down
better
than
expected
though
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
worth
trying
o
i
was
expecting
a
gimmic
and
it
is
but
it
is
also
a
tasty
one
that
is
more
than
i
expected
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
definitely
tasty
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
that
sticks
on
top
until
the
glass
is
empty
this
beer
really
smells
like
banana
i
didnt
expect
that
taste
more
like
banana
biscuits
but
lots
of
banana
flavor
decent
beer
to
boot
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
nice
beer
to
have
from
time
to
time
for
a
fruit
beer
its
pretty
good
overall
not
a
daily
beer
since
i
could
see
getting
tired
of
the
banana
pretty
fast
with
repetition
but
tasty
enough
as
a
session
ale
o
very
enjoyable
quite
interesting
that
the
beer
has
the
flavor
and
smell
of
banana
bread
so
accurate
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
is
not
a
sessionable
one
for
me
i
could
see
myself
really
enjoying
this
in
the
fall
in
the
larger
1pt
9
bottle
good
cloudy
wheat
beer
color
banana
flavor
didnt
seem
at
all
artificial
to
me
the
bottle
was
nearer
its
sell
by
date
weak
foam
head
and
maybe
that
helped
knock
the
strength
of
banana
flavor
down
to
normal
levels
an
enjoyable
pint
but
not
one
ill
have
to
buy
again
overall
this
beer
taste
some
what
like
described
a
mild
bitter
banana
bread
although
it
was
a
bit
weaker
and
much
lighter
in
flavor
than
the
aroma
suggested
o
this
was
something
that
i
had
to
try
last
year
and
found
it
to
be
just
okay
after
gulping
half
the
glass
over
the
short
time
writing
this
review
ive
found
myself
to
thoroughly
enjoy
it
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
it
smells
like
banana
runts
in
the
taste
banana
bread
with
a
pleasant
note
of
cinnamon
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
ripe
banana
in
the
aftertaste
just
like
what
its
called
banana
bread
beer
try
one
for
the
novelty
but
i
wont
be
getting
again
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
with
the
right
dessert
this
would
probably
fit
the
bill
just
right
overall
i
wouldnt
say
i
dislike
this
beer
but
was
very
let
down
despite
the
anticipation
i
had
for
this
beer
below
average
in
my
opinion
would
not
revisit
this
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
was
hoping
that
it
had
more
flavors
pop
out
then
just
banana
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
that
needs
to
be
tried
once
by
everybody
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
a
specially
good
one
i
enjoyed
the
banana
flavor
in
this
one
unlike
the
previous
fruity
beers
ive
tasted
but
the
development
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
in
a
better
way
was
not
on
par
with
my
expectations
id
recommend
it
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
and
maybe
buy
it
again
but
not
if
theres
anything
better
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
id
say
a
bit
disappointing
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
for
thanksgiving
and
not
so
much
for
now
april
27
i
love
love
love
this
beer
the
aroma
the
taste
ahhhh
i
love
anything
banana
and
banana
nut
bread
is
one
of
my
favorite
desserts
so
imagine
how
excited
i
was
when
i
saw
this
on
a
local
pubs
beer
list
it
met
every
expectation
i
would
have
of
a
banana
bread
flavored
beer
did
not
disappoint
at
all
not
overly
fruity
or
sweet
but
it
is
a
dessert
like
beer
it
was
nothing
short
of
fabulous
this
is
an
interesting
beer
tastes
and
smells
like
a
bananna
shake
a
nice
beer
for
dessert
i
dont
normally
like
fruit
beers
but
this
is
nice
and
enjoyable
had
low
expectations
on
this
beer
but
actually
enjoyed
it
tastes
like
banana
bread
without
being
to
doughy
or
malty
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
consistently
but
liked
the
experience
i
love
banana
bread
therefore
the
idea
of
a
banana
bread
beer
interested
me
this
brew
definitely
delivers
on
the
bananas
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
the
peppery
hops
are
a
nice
touch
but
stronger
malts
would
better
balance
out
the
overall
taste
prost
pours
a
dark
golden
copper
amber
with
a
small
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
ripe
banana
fruity
with
some
malt
taste
is
of
ripe
banana
light
spicy
fruitiness
and
some
mild
hops
bitterness
palate
is
a
light
body
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
banana
fruitiness
some
malt
balanced
by
a
light
hops
bitterness
the
banana
flavor
is
not
overpowering
and
not
too
sweet
overall
a
light
refreshing
sessionable
ale
i
did
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
color
looked
nice
co2
was
harsh
interesting
i
like
the
whole
concept
how
beer
is
food
aka
liquid
bread
and
this
is
like
banana
bread
it
was
i
could
taste
the
english
ale
maltyness
fresh
hops
and
of
course
the
banana
it
was
tasty
and
could
be
paired
with
anything
real
good
if
you
were
munching
on
nuts
overall
not
really
something
id
want
to
buy
or
drink
there
are
other
beers
out
there
that
provide
a
better
banana
flavor
overall
this
was
a
bit
suprising
in
that
i
actually
liked
the
flavor
but
i
just
didnt
get
the
banana
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
o
although
it
should
probably
be
a
3
0
it
gets
half
a
bonus
point
for
being
so
different
wont
have
it
again
but
dont
regret
trying
it
and
i
think
any
beer
drinking
should
this
beer
is
quite
a
journey
it
looks
normal
but
then
you
are
treated
to
a
fresh
baked
banana
bread
loaf
then
punched
in
the
mouth
with
bitterness
and
a
taste
of
your
own
blood
weird
beer
m
real
easy
to
drink
good
coating
and
aftertaste
this
beer
is
just
not
for
me
i
can
see
how
some
people
might
enjoy
it
but
i
didnt
find
it
refreshing
like
some
others
did
overall
its
bananas
in
a
glass
delicious
o
surprisingly
drinkable
not
terribly
balanced
not
a
big
fan
of
artificial
flavors
either
overall
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
fantastic
and
in
some
ways
sets
you
up
for
a
disappointment
in
the
taste
and
feel
i
just
expected
something
more
chewy
and
bananay
in
taste
more
banana
bread
in
nature
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
go
to
on
any
regularity
o
a
good
beer
one
worth
trying
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
get
it
again
overall
its
interesting
but
id
certainly
prefer
a
german
wheat
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
banana
is
rich
and
impacts
the
flavors
in
a
positive
way
the
body
and
flavor
could
be
better
but
considering
there
arent
many
beers
with
this
flavor
profile
out
there
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
overall
the
virtue
in
this
beer
is
its
unique
quality
its
banananess
and
it
delivers
in
that
sense
it
was
fun
to
drink
but
not
a
brew
for
the
ages
honeycolored
and
lots
of
carbonation
but
not
much
of
a
head
though
some
nice
white
lacing
label
says
malt
beverage
brewed
with
bananas
and
banana
flavor
added
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
beer
remind
me
not
of
banana
bread
or
even
mashed
bananas
but
rather
bananaflavored
salt
water
taffy
but
not
nearly
as
sweet
a
bit
too
watery
for
my
taste
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
little
more
heft
3
0
t
its
not
bad
but
aside
from
the
nose
it
does
fail
to
live
up
to
its
name
taste
is
too
weak
and
mouthfeel
is
too
watery
to
take
this
seriously
oa
nice
change
of
pace
no
matter
what
it
is
that
you
are
used
to
drinking
more
than
one
they
come
in
16
9
oz
bottles
would
be
too
much
sweetness
in
one
night
for
me
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
what
i
had
o
really
tasty
different
beer
promoted
aptly
really
is
what
they
say
its
supposed
to
taste
like
big
banana
bread
flavor
o
not
bad
not
great
i
probably
would
have
given
this
higher
marks
if
that
banana
taste
had
been
produced
naturally
either
through
brewing
with
bananas
or
via
some
kind
of
voodoo
yeast
magic
i
would
not
be
opposed
to
having
this
beer
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
poured
this
and
compared
along
side
an
actual
slice
of
banana
bread
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
banana
and
thats
it
and
sort
of
a
fake
banana
smell
kind
of
like
the
runts
candy
banana
same
in
the
taste
a
little
malty
but
just
tons
of
banana
thats
not
as
fake
as
the
candy
but
not
as
real
as
an
actual
banana
kind
of
thin
with
nothing
that
really
lasts
more
of
an
interesting
occasion
beer
than
anything
else
o
worked
extremely
well
in
the
recipe
i
had
i
had
seen
this
around
for
awhile
and
finally
broke
down
and
bought
a
bottle
pours
a
clean
amber
with
a
yellow
tinge
around
the
edges
the
head
doesnt
last
long
and
is
soon
just
a
thin
film
on
top
obviously
there
is
a
aroma
of
banana
and
mild
spices
like
nutmeg
it
starts
off
with
a
mild
bitterness
but
soon
mellows
out
to
a
fine
drinkable
brew
going
to
try
this
with
a
beer
bread
mix
sometime
medium
bodied
this
beer
travels
well
over
the
tongue
leaving
nothing
behind
it
has
a
dry
finish
cheers
o
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
spot
on
for
the
flavor
but
average
the
rest
of
the
way
overall
if
you
see
this
in
the
supermarket
dont
buy
just
one
to
sample
buy
at
least
2
because
youre
gonna
want
another
o
this
brew
pleasantly
surprised
me
you
hear
bananas
and
cringe
a
little
but
this
was
really
good
nice
balance
with
the
banana
and
the
hops
doa
overall
tastes
like
banana
bread
but
is
pretty
intensely
flavored
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
work
too
overall
im
glad
i
drank
this
its
a
novelty
beer
thats
worth
a
sip
or
two
maybe
not
a
full
pint
overall
definitely
something
different
im
glad
i
tried
this
it
doesnt
taste
like
the
smell
but
its
still
good
o
great
novelty
beer
not
great
in
substance
my
girlfriend
liked
it
though
so
win
o
decent
beer
especially
for
the
price
nothing
great
though
when
i
got
this
beer
i
never
heard
of
wells
brewing
company
looking
at
the
name
banana
bread
beer
my
first
thoughts
were
this
mite
be
to
sweet
to
swallow
but
i
have
been
fooled
before
this
beer
was
amazing
very
impressed
a
great
dessert
beer
overall
i
like
the
banana
flavor
but
the
beer
is
just
a
bit
too
hard
for
the
soft
banana
wells
banana
bread
beer
is
a
light
looking
lagerish
beer
with
a
hazed
yellow
color
to
it
and
a
short
lived
burst
of
white
bubbles
on
top
no
stick
smell
is
what
is
advertised
banana
and
a
whole
lot
of
it
some
cereal
scent
after
all
the
hoopla
small
amount
of
grain
taste
is
less
artificial
than
expected
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
sweet
sugar
bomb
while
its
more
of
a
lightly
sweet
banana
infused
pale
ale
without
the
hops
if
that
makes
sense
feel
is
very
light
with
a
low
amount
of
bubbled
activity
kinda
dead
on
the
mouth
i
drank
it
and
thats
that
not
something
i
would
go
for
again
a
bottle
of
this
would
be
ideal
to
split
with
a
group
of
5
people
or
so
with
a
banana
infused
dessert
or
just
simply
dump
the
bottle
into
your
next
banana
inspired
dish
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
certainly
like
bananas
it
just
wound
up
as
a
disappointment
to
me
flavor
is
soso
at
best
and
lacks
that
comforting
hominess
one
associates
with
banana
bread
mouthfeel
seems
off
and
the
whole
thing
just
doesnt
gel
all
that
nicely
overall
an
interesting
beer
to
try
would
go
good
with
bread
or
dessert
d
a
very
strange
beer
though
fun
and
enjoyable
i
really
just
see
this
as
a
novelty
beer
one
would
try
once
just
to
see
what
it
is
like
overall
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
for
this
brew
based
on
what
others
had
said
and
i
was
still
slightly
disappointed
there
really
was
no
bread
in
the
banana
bread
at
all
and
the
banana
was
pretty
much
straight
candy
banana
flavor
with
nothing
else
going
on
complexity
wise
probably
a
good
experiment
that
shouldnt
have
gone
farther
than
that
i
bought
some
double
chocolate
and
some
banana
bread
from
a
local
craft
beer
store
i
will
be
trying
the
recipe
out
this
thanksgiving
dinner
after
the
meal
and
watching
the
game
o
much
like
the
name
the
flavor
and
aroma
is
quite
gimmicky
certain
yeasts
are
capable
of
making
a
banana
compounds
but
adding
actual
bananas
to
the
brew
takes
it
too
far
finally
whatever
that
terrible
astringency
is
coming
from
in
the
taste
needs
to
be
taken
care
of
it
almost
singlehandedly
makes
this
beer
undrinkable
i
wish
it
tasted
more
like
it
smelled
as
it
is
not
horrible
but
the
hop
profile
was
a
bit
too
tuned
up
for
the
banana
and
it
didnt
mix
too
well
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
modest
head
that
displays
decent
retention
and
fair
lacing
smells
like
bananas
all
right
slightly
sweet
malty
aroma
deep
behind
and
hints
of
spices
like
nutmeg
and
all
spice
theres
a
beer
under
there
somewhere
but
for
me
only
a
swirling
of
the
glass
brings
it
through
the
banana
onslaught
taste
is
a
hint
more
beery
sweet
candy
sugar
and
light
grainy
malt
mixed
with
bananas
smooth
sweet
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
i
kind
of
enjoyed
this
although
its
not
something
i
would
have
all
the
time
extra
credit
for
thinking
outside
the
box
reviewed
from
notes
enjoyed
091611
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
of
banana
and
bread
malts
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
of
banana
and
malts
surprisingly
there
is
a
little
hop
bite
at
the
end
overall
drinkability
overall
i
think
one
must
be
a
lover
of
bananas
for
this
beer
and
while
i
like
them
i
hesitate
to
call
myself
one
who
loves
this
flavor
still
this
beer
really
works
well
its
well
balanced
the
banana
comes
through
but
does
not
overpower
and
its
quite
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
having
a
full
pint
but
that
would
be
the
end
also
given
what
i
said
about
having
this
with
banana
bread
one
evening
not
this
one
the
beer
is
really
best
for
an
after
meal
treat
or
something
with
dessert
i
think
this
beer
would
be
quite
bad
with
other
food
still
a
good
beer
overall
and
if
offered
id
have
it
again
not
sure
though
if
i
would
buy
it
again
neat
beer
neat
experience
not
a
staple
beer
i
would
drink
all
the
time
food
match
maybe
a
couple
slices
of
banana
bread
would
make
this
beer
taste
likewise
wishful
thinking
this
stuff
is
pretty
good
i
have
never
tasted
anything
like
it
it
will
not
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
but
is
still
interesting
and
worth
a
try
o
not
one
that
i
would
go
on
a
search
for
but
its
a
decent
brew
to
have
every
now
and
then
i
really
can
appreciate
that
it
smells
and
tastes
like
banana
bread
ive
had
several
beers
that
speak
of
vanilla
or
other
flavors
and
it
might
be
present
in
the
aroma
but
not
at
all
in
the
flavor
but
this
beer
is
straight
up
what
it
claims
to
be
o
i
like
my
banana
bread
with
a
bit
of
cream
cheese
i
tried
the
same
with
this
beer
and
it
does
actually
pair
quite
well
overall
i
thought
the
banana
flavor
in
this
beer
was
too
artificial
but
then
again
a
real
banana
flavor
being
more
subtle
would
probably
disappear
among
the
malts
o
its
interesting
to
be
sure
its
not
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
its
good
as
a
novelty
beer
and
it
delivers
on
what
it
promises
a
banana
bread
beer
o
definitely
worth
a
try
its
a
pretty
unique
beer
i
might
purchase
this
again
if
im
in
the
mood
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
it
seemed
like
a
weird
beer
so
i
had
to
try
it
its
not
something
ill
keep
stocked
in
my
fridge
but
im
glad
i
could
mark
it
off
my
todo
list
owas
hoping
more
for
an
amber
or
stout
type
consistency
with
darker
hops
presence
not
recommended
o
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
anticipated
would
have
liked
it
better
had
the
hops
compleatly
wiped
away
the
bananna
on
the
finish
instead
left
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
i
was
not
a
fan
of
that
being
said
it
was
easy
to
drink
however
not
something
i
would
buythis
one
was
a
gift
o
this
is
a
solid
fruit
beer
although
i
wish
the
banana
taste
was
a
little
more
pronounced
the
beer
does
a
good
job
in
introducing
the
banana
on
the
nose
but
falls
short
when
it
comes
to
replicating
that
characteristic
in
the
taste
drinkability
nice
beer
that
has
a
hint
of
banana
bread
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
oi
like
banana
bread
so
this
rates
pretty
high
for
me
o
a
excellent
beer
that
i
would
try
without
doubt
nice
style
of
beer
well
developed
not
a
banana
overwhelming
flavor
im
not
sure
i
need
another
one
but
it
does
make
you
think
maybe
it
needs
hazelnuts
or
just
a
lot
of
malt
and
some
burnt
sugar
o
not
quite
a
sinkpour
mainly
because
i
couldnt
force
myself
to
pour
out
such
an
expensive
beer
my
buddy
with
whom
i
split
it
also
finished
his
but
after
much
longer
than
he
normally
takes
im
surprised
this
comes
from
the
same
folks
who
make
the
tasty
double
chocolate
stout
the
end
o
really
interesting
beer
i
like
that
the
banana
is
obvious
and
that
you
dont
have
to
dig
for
it
too
bad
its
so
expensive
had
this
once
before
but
i
think
i
like
it
much
better
this
time
around
overall
i
love
the
taste
of
banana
in
beer
which
is
why
i
am
drawn
to
the
hefeweizen
and
dunkelweizen
styles
i
figured
with
a
name
that
has
banana
bread
in
it
then
i
must
try
it
i
would
probably
buy
again
but
cant
see
committing
to
more
than
a
bottle
at
a
time
certainly
not
a
session
beer
but
a
should
try
if
you
enjoy
banana
flavor
in
your
beer
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
dominated
by
fresh
and
fruity
banana
there
is
a
slight
tang
to
it
and
some
nutty
malt
it
tastes
mostly
of
banana
bread
not
surprisingly
with
some
sweet
malt
and
a
peppery
hop
accent
the
beer
is
light
with
low
but
sharp
carbonation
and
a
pleasing
finish
this
is
a
solid
and
straight
forward
beer
nothing
to
complain
about
here
overall
enjoyable
something
different
doubt
that
id
search
for
it
again
as
its
not
what
i
want
out
of
a
beer
not
a
bad
idea
though
this
is
decidedly
a
gimmick
o
this
is
definatly
a
try
one
time
only
brew
for
me
it
was
pretty
crazy
with
bananas
probably
too
much
if
you
love
bananas
this
is
for
you
o
worth
it
not
what
i
expected
but
better
the
color
when
poured
was
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
minimal
amout
of
foam
with
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
banana
and
yeast
was
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
of
banana
bread
yeast
and
caramel
nicly
balance
of
sweetnesstartness
that
made
this
ale
pleasant
to
drink
this
is
a
very
interesting
ale
that
i
would
buy
again
and
again
overall
i
loved
this
beer
but
i
also
love
banana
bread
so
if
you
dont
like
banana
bread
dont
bother
not
sure
if
it
is
a
real
or
artificial
flavor
but
i
dont
care
because
it
was
delicious
it
seems
like
a
simple
principal
i
like
banana
bread
i
like
beer
i
should
like
banana
bread
beer
but
i
dont
its
pretty
mediocre
i
still
go
to
weihenstephaner
hef
when
i
need
a
beery
banana
o
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
i
really
liked
drinking
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
sweet
for
a
fuit
beer
overall
it
was
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
appearance
has
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
crisp
dissapating
head
smell
has
the
upfront
banana
bread
aroma
with
the
malt
in
the
back
taste
has
a
good
balance
bringing
out
the
bananas
with
the
malt
and
hop
mouthfeel
is
closer
to
medium
that
imo
should
have
a
lower
carbonation
to
bring
out
a
softer
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
brings
out
what
it
says
it
is
o
something
different
for
sure
i
might
try
it
again
sometime
o
overall
this
is
just
an
pretty
average
beer
buy
one
and
move
on
this
beer
pours
out
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
smell
is
very
nice
bananas
candy
sweetness
and
bready
malts
the
taste
is
a
bit
bizarre
but
still
pretty
good
the
banana
bread
and
the
beer
parts
of
this
beer
seem
to
exist
on
two
different
planes
that
are
forced
together
when
i
sip
this
the
beer
hangs
out
on
one
side
with
a
decent
bready
caramel
malt
presence
even
if
its
kind
of
watery
the
banana
bread
is
over
on
the
other
side
being
all
delicious
and
stuff
they
never
quite
coexist
to
become
as
delicious
as
they
can
be
but
its
still
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
but
can
strain
due
to
sweetness
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
truly
a
one
and
done
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
overall
its
a
great
beer
to
try
but
probably
not
a
repeat
brew
poured
a
clear
light
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settled
to
a
light
haze
i
thought
this
would
be
darker
for
some
reason
smells
like
bananas
banana
runts
actually
i
know
they
use
real
banana
in
this
but
i
cant
help
that
it
smells
artificial
perhaps
banana
is
just
a
tough
flavor
to
pull
off
anyways
theres
some
sweet
caramel
malt
in
there
too
i
guess
you
could
use
your
imagination
and
see
where
the
bread
comes
from
but
im
not
digging
it
taste
follows
the
nose
closely
mainly
banana
and
some
sweet
malt
flavors
of
coffee
and
cocoa
powder
too
sweet
body
is
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
i
can
understand
why
some
people
like
this
but
it
just
isnt
my
thing
pass
probably
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
drank
not
overly
sweet
just
right
o
i
thought
the
smell
was
fantastic
and
the
taste
although
not
what
i
expected
was
well
done
it
was
a
bit
high
priced
so
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
this
often
but
id
gladly
have
more
overall
this
beer
is
exactly
as
billed
although
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
it
was
interesting
to
have
the
banana
influence
without
the
spices
as
in
most
weizens
though
and
worth
a
shot
o
interesting
drop
this
very
sweet
despite
this
one
being
2
months
past
its
best
before
date
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
a
very
nice
wintery
desert
beer
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
if
u
r
looking
for
something
different
it
will
work
thanks
to
spinrsx
for
sharing
was
a
nice
split
would
recommend
to
any
banana
bread
aficionado
overalli
dont
like
this
beer
however
i
do
have
to
give
them
some
props
although
i
will
probably
never
drink
this
again
i
would
reccomend
it
to
the
right
person
overall
a
good
brew
its
like
a
hefe
on
steroids
this
would
make
a
great
dessert
beer
o
great
smell
to
this
that
makes
you
love
it
the
taste
holds
up
to
the
smell
in
the
beginning
but
leaves
you
underwhelmed
as
it
becomes
too
water
id
get
this
again
once
in
a
while
when
im
looking
for
a
sweeter
brew
which
wont
fill
you
up
overall
a
disappointment
even
though
my
expectations
were
not
particularly
high
i
like
banana
bread
a
lot
but
i
think
i
will
stick
to
the
real
thing
the
beer
would
be
improved
somewhat
if
it
was
not
in
a
clear
bottle
and
was
not
subject
to
being
skunked
i
tried
this
beer
on
june
11
2011
after
purchasing
at
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
red
colour
with
a
very
thin
white
cap
the
aroma
was
banana
spices
grainy
malt
and
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
is
mild
fruit
spices
and
acidic
maltiness
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
to
share
with
friends
especially
those
afraid
of
hoppier
beers
d
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
through
at
all
but
no
less
its
not
particularly
pleasant
to
drink
because
of
the
strange
flavor
combination
d
it
has
several
issues
but
it
is
still
tasty
id
recommend
splitting
a
bottle
with
23
people
as
this
is
infinitely
better
in
small
doses
the
beer
peeled
out
of
the
bottle
at
a
speed
unrivaled
by
any
canned
beer
it
really
took
me
by
surprise
so
i
got
yellow
and
ran
away
until
it
had
a
chance
to
settle
the
head
was
a
puffy
pillowy
twoplus
fingers
of
thick
yellowwhite
head
that
held
in
until
a
big
exhalation
of
co2
when
it
fell
all
at
once
by
gar
i
can
smell
bananas
everywhere
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
now
if
you
thought
bupgoo
was
wrong
in
being
marketed
to
the
kiddies
this
is
so
far
afield
that
i
cannot
believe
that
it
exists
i
am
going
to
see
if
my
current
beau
she
from
cabaret
if
you
could
see
her
approves
she
does
oh
my
darling
monkey
wait
i
see
a
monkey
with
a
bomb
its
inspector
clouseau
yelling
about
a
minkey
with
a
bimb
or
somesuch
these
brits
its
so
hard
to
tell
what
theyre
on
about
at
times
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
so
maybe
he
was
saying
something
about
it
being
thin
why
cant
the
british
speak
english
its
so
confounding
now
its
planet
of
the
apes
get
your
hands
off
of
my
banana
beer
you
damn
dirty
ape
its
irresistible
to
the
simian
set
apparently
have
you
ever
seen
woody
allen
in
bananas
he
sports
a
chefidel
beard
that
lends
itself
to
my
nickname
taste
was
as
advertised
bananas
with
a
hint
of
caramel
finish
was
very
banana
and
if
i
liked
bananas
that
would
be
a
good
thing
the
hops
monkey
on
my
back
nodded
in
agreement
o
drain
pour
as
much
as
i
love
banana
bread
this
doesnt
taste
good
at
all
probably
wont
go
for
it
again
might
be
nice
mixed
with
another
alcohol
like
vodka
as
a
flavoring
for
a
mixed
drink
it
lacked
hopping
and
body
overall
well
it
tasted
kind
of
like
banana
bread
i
guess
its
definitely
worth
trying
this
beer
just
for
novelty
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
though
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
o
one
and
done
for
me
moderately
dark
straw
with
a
thin
ring
of
off
white
foam
surprisingly
pleasing
aromas
of
overripe
banana
vanillabrown
sugar
perfume
sweet
with
medium
bitterness
to
balance
i
like
the
sweetness
in
this
one
good
dose
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
medium
bodied
quite
active
carbonation
but
also
creamy
enjoyable
pretty
good
dessert
or
snack
beer
and
not
overly
sweet
despite
having
both
corn
and
sugar
could
be
a
regular
pickup
alongside
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
o
disappointing
effort
from
wells
an
interesting
beer
but
it
cant
overcome
all
of
its
apparent
shortcomings
pale
amberorange
colour
light
white
head
no
lace
smell
is
almost
identical
to
a
banana
popsicle
malty
and
fairly
big
in
that
department
but
you
would
never
know
it
from
all
the
banana
taste
is
banana
malt
rolls
in
and
brings
a
nice
bitterness
with
it
biscuity
with
banana
in
finish
and
aftertaste
medium
body
and
slightly
syrupy
mild
carbonation
this
isnt
bad
and
quite
different
i
could
drink
this
again
but
not
for
a
good
little
while
though
this
may
just
not
be
my
thing
clear
bottle
pours
into
a
mug
a
pale
golden
with
a
good
size
banana
coloured
head
nose
is
banana
esters
and
malty
taste
is
rather
subdued
and
weak
subtle
hints
of
a
hefe
in
the
esters
present
certainly
a
banana
taste
and
more
malt
in
the
flavour
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
overall
a
dissapointment
weak
on
flavour
and
gimmicky
not
to
be
revisited
shame
since
i
really
enjoyed
wells
dbl
choc
stout
coppery
amber
color
with
moderate
cap
of
khaki
head
muted
notes
of
fresh
baked
banana
bread
lightly
nutty
some
hints
of
sweetness
taste
is
much
more
in
line
with
banana
bread
in
this
presentation
solid
lightly
sweet
bready
malts
comine
with
bannana
and
bubble
gum
notes
from
the
yeasts
only
negative
to
say
is
there
is
a
slightly
watery
grape
presence
towards
the
back
end
of
the
taste
medium
bodied
mildly
carbonated
improvement
over
bottle
accomplishes
its
goal
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
splitting
it
with
a
friend
is
the
way
to
go
and
it
makes
a
good
night
opener
the
subtle
banana
flavor
adds
enough
to
make
it
interesting
without
cheapening
it
worth
a
spin
o
worth
a
try
but
at
6
00
a
bottle
theres
certainly
better
beers
to
buy
a
bit
of
a
novelty
but
a
decent
attempt
nonetheless
o
overall
i
feel
let
down
i
wanted
to
get
that
big
banana
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
what
stands
out
most
to
me
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
my
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
i
think
the
idea
could
be
pulled
off
but
this
isnt
it
skip
this
one
this
beer
is
definitely
something
to
try
for
the
novelty
of
it
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
a
complete
drain
pour
although
i
did
only
have
about
6
ounces
or
so
of
it
i
could
stomach
it
its
pretty
sickening
after
a
while
and
something
i
cannot
fathom
why
anyone
would
drink
this
more
than
once
nice
try
wells
fairly
easy
drinking
not
too
sweet
and
lowish
alcohol
overall
i
have
a
hard
time
recommending
this
beer
it
was
an
interesting
experiment
but
i
certainly
wont
be
buying
it
again
its
one
of
those
things
that
you
try
just
to
say
that
youve
tried
it
overall
when
i
first
seen
the
name
banana
bread
beer
i
almost
jumped
all
over
it
i
thought
wow
what
a
cool
concept
if
they
could
actually
pull
it
off
and
to
be
honest
this
one
has
gone
above
and
beyond
my
expectations
coming
through
and
delivering
on
all
perspectives
thank
you
to
the
lcbo
for
bringing
this
one
in
for
the
summer
release
because
i
will
be
going
back
tomorrow
to
stock
up
on
more
before
they
all
disappear
a
great
beer
that
does
exactly
what
it
says
and
is
not
overpowering
while
doing
it
wells
youngs
makes
some
great
almost
underrated
beers
that
for
the
few
that
i
have
tried
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
overall
a
good
beer
it
would
go
great
with
some
dessert
not
my
idea
of
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
great
when
your
in
the
mood
for
something
different
o
see
taste
worth
trying
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
another
o
this
beer
isnt
necessarily
bad
but
it
is
too
unfocused
and
uneven
overall
this
beer
proved
to
fall
into
the
buy
it
once
for
novelty
category
try
it
if
you
must
but
dont
set
expectations
too
high
there
are
far
better
dessert
beers
out
there
i
would
drink
this
time
and
time
again
if
it
was
readily
available
the
bottles
however
are
larger
and
it
is
not
sold
in
6
packs
only
by
the
bottle
its
imported
from
england
regardless
i
would
totally
buy
this
beer
again
i
wonder
if
this
was
served
in
a
restaurant
if
they
would
serve
this
with
a
banana
wedge
on
the
rim
of
the
glass
talk
about
fruiting
your
beer
o
not
bad
overall
but
definitely
is
a
novelty
beer
smells
fantastic
and
tastes
ok
i
cant
imagine
buying
it
again
o
i
have
big
dreams
for
this
beer
the
aroma
is
outstanding
i
feel
like
the
idea
is
awesome
the
execution
was
just
not
perfect
this
is
not
the
first
time
ive
had
it
its
been
about
a
year
although
i
may
want
more
from
it
i
think
im
going
to
get
it
more
often
and
see
how
well
it
will
fuse
with
some
stouts
hell
yes
son
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
without
being
heavy
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
excellent
and
highly
recommended
interesting
the
beer
pours
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
banana
syrup
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
banana
and
toffee
malt
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
brown
sugar
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
it
definitely
tastes
like
bananas
but
after
a
while
the
beer
gets
a
little
hard
to
drink
o
i
love
beer
and
i
love
banana
bread
this
brew
gives
both
my
experience
is
most
fruit
beers
dont
taste
like
beer
or
the
fruit
and
each
of
the
flavors
are
ruined
in
trying
this
beer
marvelously
accomplishes
both
giving
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
beer
but
also
tastes
like
banana
bread
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
both
works
exceptionally
well
when
paired
with
puddings
or
flan
as
dessert
o
i
was
completely
baffled
by
this
beer
as
you
probably
read
there
were
a
lot
of
aspects
that
surprised
me
about
it
anyway
it
turned
out
pretty
well
i
consider
this
a
bit
of
a
novelty
beer
and
its
not
necessarily
something
id
seek
out
again
however
if
it
came
up
on
tap
somewhere
i
might
give
it
another
go
in
the
name
of
good
fun
the
beer
is
a
light
brown
color
with
not
much
foam
it
smells
and
tastes
just
like
banana
bread
as
you
would
expect
i
can
also
taste
slight
notes
of
caramel
and
maple
syrup
it
tastes
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
watery
i
wish
it
could
be
fuller
it
is
an
overall
good
beer
that
i
will
definitely
try
again
this
beer
is
definitely
something
that
a
little
different
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
nice
hazy
light
brown
color
the
head
is
thick
fluffy
and
white
the
aromas
are
exactly
what
you
expect
banana
and
bread
the
smell
is
dead
on
theres
not
question
about
that
the
taste
is
pretty
much
spot
on
too
the
beer
has
a
strong
banana
flavor
up
from
that
turned
into
a
bready
dryness
after
you
swallow
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
ton
of
it
all
at
once
i
feel
that
the
flavors
are
too
sweet
and
are
too
much
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
interesting
but
doesnt
quite
cut
it
for
me
as
there
is
something
about
the
combination
of
bananas
hops
and
mineral
water
that
i
just
fail
to
appreciate
that
said
reasonably
drinkable
although
i
could
see
myself
getting
tired
of
it
after
one
or
two
not
bad
d
low
just
not
as
advertised
didnt
pick
up
any
banana
bread
notes
pretty
basic
and
tastes
very
synthetic
its
not
that
it
tastes
bad
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
to
me
pretty
average
and
im
not
sure
what
market
theyre
trying
to
target
with
this
one
overall
i
could
enjoy
these
during
christmas
or
with
a
thanksgiving
dinner
nothing
to
seek
out
if
unavailable
but
it
is
decent
a
banoffee
pie
sort
of
beer
o
its
a
good
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
bananas
o
very
drinkable
but
not
as
much
banana
as
i
wanted
decent
try
o
overall
somewhat
of
a
letdown
after
the
great
aroma
was
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
of
this
glad
i
tried
this
but
likely
wont
pick
this
up
again
anytime
soon
a
unique
type
of
ale
that
yall
should
try
at
least
once
no
cloying
sweetness
to
worry
about
helps
if
you
enjoy
bananaesque
flavor
but
even
thats
not
overdone
banana
bread
beer
an
interesting
idea
but
only
average
execution
here
d
more
drinkable
than
one
might
expect
not
overpowering
md
nice
and
smooth
exceptionally
drinkable
absolutely
loved
this
one
but
even
though
i
usually
like
flavored
beers
more
than
most
people
this
barely
works
it
beats
chilli
beer
i
probably
rated
it
a
bit
higher
than
i
should
have
d
3
5
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
the
only
thing
that
may
hold
me
back
is
its
sweetness
but
thats
a
personal
preference
it
is
light
enough
that
it
really
isnt
filling
not
necessarily
what
youd
think
of
with
banana
bread
its
an
impressive
take
on
the
concept
the
aromas
and
initial
flavors
of
the
brew
are
worth
a
shot
for
anyone
that
enjoys
both
banana
bread
and
a
good
brew
serving
type
bottle
its
a
pretty
medium
copper
color
with
very
little
carbonation
or
foam
the
aroma
is
a
nice
banana
even
though
it
seems
a
tad
artificial
the
taste
really
is
like
banana
bread
not
as
sweet
or
spicy
as
im
used
to
but
its
good
it
goes
down
ok
but
it
seems
to
leave
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
its
ok
d
definitely
drinkable
very
interesting
to
try
and
i
think
i
might
actually
get
this
one
again
as
well
the
banana
taste
is
also
not
overpowering
it
is
smooth
though
perhaps
a
bit
too
carbonated
the
ale
comes
first
with
the
fruitiness
second
dry
at
the
end
it
is
a
nice
ale
but
not
a
particularly
spectacular
taste
overall
worth
it
to
try
as
wellsyoung
have
a
stellar
reputation
but
i
would
personally
stick
to
the
bombardier
i
went
out
to
the
beer
store
to
try
out
something
new
that
i
had
never
tried
before
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
bought
this
beer
but
i
was
surprised
at
how
great
it
tasted
if
you
ever
want
to
try
something
different
that
is
enjoyable
give
this
beer
a
chance
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
banana
taste
isnt
gimmicky
and
is
balanced
to
some
degree
by
the
flavors
of
malts
and
hops
however
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
d
the
beer
tastes
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
i
would
definelty
have
this
bber
again
it
is
also
a
good
beer
to
have
several
of
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
cant
stop
smelling
this
beer
rich
and
delicious
banana
bread
aroma
yum
color
is
a
nice
dark
amber
moderate
head
when
poured
into
youngs
pint
glass
flavor
is
a
much
more
subtle
version
of
the
nose
mild
banana
supported
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
akin
to
maybe
an
english
bitter
not
too
sweet
not
too
hoppy
really
enjoyable
beer
i
think
i
could
have
several
great
to
share
with
a
domesticated
primate
after
a
meal
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
to
me
this
beer
is
was
hard
to
drink
the
flavor
were
all
over
the
board
and
not
consistant
i
really
was
hoping
that
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
than
this
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
was
expecting
worse
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
a
different
beer
worth
a
try
for
its
uniqueness
d
very
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
and
tasty
for
the
fruit
beer
option
a
nice
desert
beer
ive
tried
this
seeming
oddity
before
but
havent
been
able
to
remember
much
about
it
til
now
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
nutmeg
light
cinnamon
and
rye
bread
so
far
it
seems
to
live
up
to
its
name
the
taste
brings
in
the
same
elements
along
with
some
raisins
and
a
touch
of
fake
banana
flavor
not
entirely
unlike
that
found
in
certain
yellow
runts
full
disclosure
its
my
favorite
flavor
of
runt
but
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
here
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
nothing
really
outstanding
by
any
stretch
but
it
could
have
been
bonechillingly
worse
given
the
desired
final
product
d
as
much
as
i
love
this
beer
id
be
good
after
no
more
than
say
2
pints
no
offense
intended
its
just
so
flavorful
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
would
be
the
perfect
desert
beer
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
with
some
cake
and
ice
cream
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
amateur
and
expert
alike
d
very
good
tasty
probably
one
my
top
10
favorites
id
call
this
a
stunt
beer
and
its
a
successful
stunt
in
the
fruit
beer
spectrum
its
in
the
mellow
end
of
the
spectrum
from
the
more
tart
cherry
and
berry
varieties
worth
at
least
a
try
if
youre
open
to
fruit
beers
and
if
fruit
beers
are
a
fave
for
you
this
could
become
a
regular
fruit
beers
are
my
favorite
i
like
em
spicey
and
sweet
wells
bananabread
beer
delivers
on
both
counts
the
smell
is
great
it
smells
as
if
youre
baking
banana
bread
right
in
your
glass
i
think
over
all
this
beer
would
appeal
to
both
fruit
beer
lovers
and
beer
fundamentalists
this
is
a
real
beer
with
real
beer
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
banana
and
spice
flavors
i
think
the
pairing
works
really
well
and
combines
to
accomplish
something
out
of
the
ordinary
and
great
one
of
me
all
time
favs
while
this
isnt
even
close
to
being
a
favorite
of
mine
id
say
that
within
this
category
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
dregardless
what
other
people
have
said
about
this
beers
concept
and
execution
i
cant
knock
it
its
successful
within
the
parameters
of
what
the
brewer
was
trying
to
accomplish
i
enjoyed
it
dyoull
probably
want
to
stop
after
one
but
its
a
hell
of
a
clever
idea
well
worth
trying
d
ok
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
avoided
for
nearly
10
years
now
i
know
why
it
is
just
ok
if
it
was
heavier
body
slightly
darker
might
have
been
delicious
but
too
watery
for
me
try
it
with
a
friend
no
need
to
seek
this
out
i
enjoy
this
one
on
an
early
weekend
morning
or
late
evening
nice
clear
brown
color
minimal
head
with
a
light
lacing
great
aromas
of
banana
wheat
and
spices
has
a
good
bitter
spice
taste
with
a
good
portion
of
banana
in
there
as
well
good
balance
of
bitter
and
smooth
flavors
finishes
nice
with
a
after
taste
leaving
you
thinking
you
had
a
slice
of
banana
bread
some
may
lovehate
a
dessert
beer
or
one
that
is
flavored
with
something
like
banana
but
i
do
enjoy
this
one
in
moderation
it
is
not
overdone
in
the
least
it
accurately
encompasses
the
banana
bread
vibe
without
sacrificing
the
beer
itself
d
a
few
sips
were
interesting
but
34
of
the
bottle
was
a
drain

2

super
fresh

a
deep

copper
hue
with
a
bright
off
white
cream
colored
head
fine
speckled
lacing
scattered
on
the
sides
of
my
chalice
nose
is
straight
up
banana
syrup
with
some
sweet
underlying
caramel
malts
flavor
actually
has
a
balanced
level
of
sweetness
upfront
though
its
banana
splitbanana
fosters
with
a
dry
finish
and
nice
mineral
water
character
ive
passed
on
this
for
quite
some
time
glad
i
tried
it
theres
a
nice
banana
flavor
that
comes
through
with
caramelized
sugars
bringing
dessert
like
notions
to
mind
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
mellow
nothing
heavy
or
harsh
the
sweetness
is
initially
a
bit
cloying
but
it
fades
nicely
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
drinkability
overall
is
decent
something
that
will
peak
the
interests
of
non
beer
folks
but
not
something
i
want
to
session
with
d
too
fruity
sweet
for
my
palate
to
drink
exclusively
for
an
entire
night
but
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
once
in
a
while
d
hefe
lovers
might
enjoy
this
more
than
others
due
to
the
bananalike
flavors
that
are
often
found
in
such
beers
very
drinkable
and
tasty
would
definitely
have
another
nooot
bad
i
came
in
expecting
to
pour
half
of
it
out
but
i
think
i
shall
finish
er
off
d
not
digging
this
as
much
as
i
did
before
smell
and
taste
is
a
bit
too
artificial
for
me
resulting
in
an
almost
fake
tasting
brew
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
liked
it
and
think
it
would
make
a
refreshing
summer
patip
beer
it
is
not
overly
carbonated
a
little
fizz
on
the
tongue
with
a
warming
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
complimented
by
the
fruitiness
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
and
easily
nor
is
it
very
expensive
so
with
5

abv
you
may
want
to
be
careful
wells
banana
bread
beer
has
a
dark
yellow
colour
and
a
good
3
cm
head
that
lasts
awhile
the
smell
is
mixture
of
banana
and
yeast
banana
bread
this
beer
starts
out
with
hops
and
banana
esters
the
finish
is
pretty
smooth
though
the
banana
flavour
remains
this
beer
really
is
like
banana
bread
but
its
a
little
too
much
for
me
will
definitely
buy
again
dvery
drinkable
made
me
want
another
glancing
over
other
reviews
it
seems
that
wells
banana
bread
is
a
fairly
divisive
beer
im
not
entirely
sure
why
i
found
it
to
be
a
fairly
conventional
commonplace
english
ale
albeit
with
some
banana
flavour
it
should
be
straightforward
enough
do
you
like
beer
do
you
like
banana
chances
are
you
already
know
whether
this
interests
you
bottom
line
underwhelming
and
uninspired
definitely
tastes
nothing
like
banana
bread
d
the
banana
was
a
little
much
so
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
while
the
constituent
components
are
all
there
they
seem
to
come
off
as
individual
players
disjointed
rather
than
the
supple
blend
that
is
yer
twoweek
old
bananas
and
sugary
bread
and
chocolate
chips
cant
forget
those
a
mere
curiosity
as
far
as
beer
is
concerned
but
relatively
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
for
its
ilk
very
clear
but
dark
oak
in
color
has
a
nice
head
but
virtually
no
lacing
the
color
and
how
transparent
it
is
is
quite
remarkable
nose
is
bananas
bubblegum
peppery
not
so
different
from
a
hefeweizen
to
me
the
sweet
banana
is
most
prominent
think
laffy
taffy
would
get
higher
marks
but
it
is
a
bit
subdued
not
so
much
of
a
banana
flavor
here
heavy
does
of
wheat
with
a
peppery
finish
and
the
banana
kind
of
lingers
in
the
background
throw
a
little
more
banana
in
there
and
we
would
have
a
winner
overall
taste
is
a
bit
weak
and
watery
in
itself
but
at
least
it
isnt
offensive
mouthfeel
is
great
and
i
can
say
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
in
the
summertime
overall
glad
i
tried
it
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
especially
in
the
summer
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
more
impressive
than
the
brews
tastes
and
mouthfeel
pretty
good
brew
but
once
the
novelty
wears
off
it
is
not
really
something
i
could
session
drinkability
wells
really
hit
it
on
this
one
i
could
only
drink
one
glass
of
this
beer
because
of
how
different
it
was
probably
would
give
you
a
stomach
ache
if
you
had
too
much
of
it
tough
to
say
this
beers
drinkability
overall
im
sorry
i
bought
a
4
pack
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
single
not
bad
one
of
these
every
once
in
a
while
is
a
nice
treat
id
pair
it
with
banana
bread
if
you
have
any
starts
off
strong
nice
retention
on
the
head
amber
color
crystal
clear
with
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
all
downhill
from
there
aroma
is
what
you
might
expect
bananas
and
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
not
bad
decently
soft
up
front
with
the
bananas
the
predominant
flavor
after
that
nothing
no
middle
or
finish
like
a
banana
flavored
light
beer
some
bitterness
in
the
end
but
not
enough
to
make
this
beer
interesting
medium
bodied
a
novelty
thats
worth
one
try
but
thats
it
out
of
the
bottle
the
smell
of
banana
is
the
first
thing
you
notice
the
color
is
a
nice
copper
color
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
smell
but
it
is
subtle
and
nice
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
but
that
makes
the
beer
smooth
like
a
nice
banana
bread
you
are
left
with
a
nice
after
taste
of
bananas
i
would
drink
this
again
but
would
not
make
it
a
part
of
the
regular
rotation
there
is
more
carbonation
than
i
really
like
but
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
and
has
a
dry
aftertaste
very
drinkable
but
again
nothing
special
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
looks
ok
and
smells
ok
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
a
bit
pricey
in
nyc
at
5
99
for
a
1
pint
9
oz
bottle
but
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
again
and
again
perhaps
savoring
it
just
for
special
occsasions
clear
copper
color
with
little
head
retention
has
a
mashed
ripe
banana
smell
with
sprucey
piney
notes
the
taste
reflects
the
aroma
the
banana
fruit
is
balanced
with
a
light
piney
hop
flavor
not
an
overbearing
fruit
beer
it
is
light
in
body
and
very
drinkable
with
a
clean
finish
i
get
a
lot
of
banana
and
malt
from
this
beer
its
one
i
want
to
try
homebrewing
but
i
am
afraid
this
beer
wont
disappear
for
years
if
i
make
5
gallons
overall
i
would
buy
again
and
make
it
a
regular
in
my
rotation
for
some
reason
i
am
attracted
to
concoctions
like
this
offering
from
well
pours
a
good
looking
pour
with
frothy
white
bubbles
that
dont
last
smell
was
a
potent
banana
bread
smell
they
werent
lying
it
had
a
more
smell
than
taste
but
thats
good
otherwise
it
would
be
overpowering
it
had
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
was
a
very
balanced
brew
however
one
is
probably
enough
overall
nothing
special
but
its
drinkable
and
light
in
flavor
smooth
no
hop
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
bannana
flavor
something
to
try
and
say
youve
tried
it
then
move
on
pours
out
a
light
amber
with
a
thin
whispy
head
that
manages
to
maintain
some
decent
lacing
smells
like
banana
bread
with
some
strong
aromas
of
vanilla
and
buttery
white
cake
icing
and
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
very
well
tastes
like
candied
bananas
someone
posted
the
resemblance
to
the
banana
runts
and
they
were
spot
on
a
very
sweet
and
rich
beer
definitely
a
dessert
pairing
brew
while
at
the
same
time
managing
to
bring
about
characteristics
of
the
malts
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
around
after
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
the
beer
itself
is
quite
rich
with
a
fairly
high
carbonation
level
all
in
all
a
good
beer
for
what
its
worth
more
of
a
novelty
or
a
one
time
attraction
this
is
an
interesting
semidrinkable
beer
but
i
think
it
belongs
paired
with
food
its
too
odd
to
stand
alone
it
would
definitely
make
a
good
breakfast
beer
maybe
with
some
fried
potatoes
bacon
and
eggs
yum
na
zdravje
d
low
abv
and
good
flavors
make
this
pretty
damn
drinkable
may
not
be
everyones
cup
tea
but
it
is
worth
looking
at
to
try
something
different
go
for
one
just
to
try
it
really
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
sweet
yuengling
overall
i
have
a
confidence
now
in
whatever
the
wells
youngs
ltd
brewing
company
does
this
beer
is
called
banana
bread
beer
and
truely
lives
up
to
that
title
great
beer
that
would
be
great
with
your
sunday
brunch
or
with
desserts
like
pumpkin
or
peacon
pies
excellent
brew
dr
id
have
it
again
and
recommend
it
to
friends
as
a
good
fruit
beer
i
love
this
beer
and
completely
satisfied
with
my
selection
i
was
completely
love
the
smell
and
aroma
of
the
beer
and
reminds
me
of
banana
bread
the
clear
color
is
beautiful
the
pour
of
the
beer
into
the
glass
was
smooth
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
ddrinkability
depends
on
situation
a
night
out
with
the
guys
not
for
me
summertime
at
the
pool
ill
have
this
all
afternoon
finish
was
also
poor
in
my
opinion
there
is
almost
a
skunky
beer
finish
under
the
banana
flavors
the
slight
banana
aftertaste
is
also
unpleasant
overall
this
is
a
nice
novelty
brew
but
its
not
even
the
best
beer
ive
had
with
bananas
in
it
im
a
huge
fan
of
dunkels
d
worth
trying
once
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
one
sitting
very
recommended
for
people
who
enjoy
fruity
beers
d
very
drinkable
for
a
novelty
beer
the
flavors
arent
over
the
top
so
it
doesnt
overwork
your
palate
this
beer
is
amazing
its
a
little
sweet
smooth
tastes
like
bananas
but
not
to
the
degree
that
its
unpleasent
as
it
finishes
with
a
wheat
taste
i
cant
overemphasize
how
smooth
this
beer
is
the
low
alcohol
isnt
even
detectable
and
overall
i
find
it
about
as
drinkable
as
beers
can
come
drinkability
suffers
because
i
dont
like
sparking
water
would
not
buy
this
again
too
bad
i
was
hoping
to
like
this
one
look
this
is
drinkable
they
didnt
do
a
bad
job
but
i
have
two
philosophical
questions
for
you
1
why
brew
beer
with
actual
bananas
when
there
are
already
beers
with
stronger
banana
flavors
simply
from
the
yeast
and
natural
process
used
and
2
why
brew
beer
with
actual
bananas
if
in
fine
print
at
the
bottom
of
the
label
it
says
banana
flavor
added
meaning
they
cheated
to
get
to
this
level
of
banananess
clearly
simply
adding
bananas
to
the
brew
doesnt
get
the
job
done
what
you
have
here
is
apparently
the
wine
cooler
version
of
bananalike
beer
overall
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
flavored
beer
i
couldnt
drink
it
all
night
because
of
its
uniqueness
but
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
dessert
substitution
if
you
combine
half
this
beer
with
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
you
will
be
in
for
a
real
treat
you
can
thank
me
later
this
st
is
bananas
bananas
this
is
the
beer
i
envision
everyone
being
forced
to
drink
in
hell
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
extremely
well
and
if
the
taste
were
more
prevalent
i
would
definitly
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
as
it
was
certainly
interesting
in
fact
it
was
quite
enjoyable
but
i
dont
see
myself
ever
buying
this
again
i
would
love
to
see
a
porter
or
stout
that
could
live
up
to
the
nose
of
this
unique
beer
the
rich
buttery
smell
and
flavors
just
beg
for
a
chewy
big
body
to
savor
d
very
delicious
complex
and
deep
with
nutty
flavors
dominate
rich
and
hints
of
spice
very
nice
slight
hops
and
well
balanced
vanilla
tones
set
this
one
off
from
the
regular
this
beer
had
about
a
one
finger
head
its
smell
consisted
of
a
strong
aroma
of
bananas
and
also
had
a
nutty
smell
it
does
smell
very
much
like
banana
bread
it
was
medium
bodied
it
had
a
good
level
of
drinkability
and
felt
smooth
but
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
one
sitting
overall
drink
on
this
one
is
kinda
rough
you
expect
a
bit
stronger
flavor
but
by
the
time
your
done
it
feels
you
have
ate
a
loaf
of
banana
nut
bread
this
would
not
be
a
good
session
beer
at
all
a
novelity
of
course
but
would
still
have
one
again
if
offered
might
not
seek
to
purchase
again
though
d
i
really
wish
this
beer
tasted
more
like
real
bananas
i
love
the
idea
of
the
beer
i
just
dont
think
it
was
excicuted
very
well
copper
color
1
finger
head
smells
like
nuts
and
bananas
success
tastes
like
banana
bread
lots
of
nuttiness
and
banana
flavor
the
banana
fruit
flavor
comes
across
really
big
its
like
drinking
banana
pudding
or
banana
nut
bread
something
like
that
i
like
it
when
a
beer
thats
supposed
to
be
flavored
like
something
tastes
just
like
it
medium
body
mouthfeel
with
pretty
good
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
glad
i
tried
it
althow
i
think
they
should
make
a
porterstout
version
of
this
one
kind
of
like
youngs
double
chocolate
but
youngs
dbl
banana
this
has
been
a
beer
i
have
been
afraid
to
try
but
i
made
the
leap
and
wow
this
is
great
the
apperance
is
an
average
brown
the
smell
is
remarkable
banana
and
nuts
just
like
banana
bread
the
taste
is
exactly
would
you
should
expect
out
of
the
name
you
can
taste
the
bananas
and
the
nuts
with
a
backing
of
booze
really
good
beer
not
something
to
pound
its
farly
light
and
not
overly
sweet
loved
this
beer
awesome
taste
will
drink
it
again
but
not
often
seeing
the
9
dollar
pricetag
was
a
little
much
around
a
fingers
worth
of
slightly
offwhite
head
comprised
mainly
of
larger
bubbles
which
means
little
retention
lackluster
lacing
as
well
superclear
copper
orange
color
with
a
darkening
reddish
aspect
a
few
lazy
bubbles
here
and
there
within
banana
goes
through
loud
and
clear
in
the
nose
however
fresh
and
light
not
in
any
estery
fashion
cinnamon
and
vanilla
too
sponge
cake
lighter
granola
lemon
yogurt
perhaps
a
hint
of
cherry
as
well
lightbodied
light
enough
that
the
active
carbonation
prevents
a
lot
of
the
flavor
from
soaking
in
the
banana
fig
pear
fruit
attenuated
the
same
for
the
bread
to
cake
aspect
the
lemon
and
vanilla
fold
into
each
other
the
spiciness
and
nuttiness
takes
a
couple
of
steps
back
without
more
richness
of
flavor
the
carbonation
keeps
plowing
ahead
detracts
from
mouth
feel
otherwise
inoffensive
and
innocuous
d
hmm
almost
a
tough
one
to
call
if
you
havent
tried
it
try
it
not
something
youd
want
to
drink
a
few
of
but
a
decently
drinkable
session
brew
its
like
an
english
hefewiezen
with
the
wheatbeer
style
flavoring
and
the
tangy
finish
my
wife
picked
this
one
up
one
day
while
we
were
out
beer
shopping
and
we
split
the
bottle
with
a
friend
poured
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
quickly
disappearing
white
head
aromas
of
bananas
but
not
real
bananas
more
like
banana
laffytaffys
on
the
palate
more
banana
flavors
some
realsome
fake
brown
bread
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
fairly
one
dimensional
and
really
not
very
good
d
not
very
drinkable
considering
its
novelty
100
and
it
tastes
so
much
like
banana
nut
bread
youll
be
tired
of
it
half
way
through
that
is
if
you
dont
like
eating
a
whole
loaf
of
it
at
one
time
md
at
first
it
takes
like
a
nice
hefeweizen
but
then
the
sweetness
hits
and
there
is
a
little
to
much
sweetness
i
might
give
this
another
try
but
i
am
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
one
notes
is
and
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
kind
of
expecting
a
hefeweizen
style
for
what
ever
reason
im
guessing
this
is
more
like
a
bitters
brewed
with
bananas
rather
than
relying
on
a
bavarian
yeasts
banana
like
esters
drinkability
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
good
for
those
looking
for
a
mild
decent
session
fruit
beer
i
was
kind
of
hoping
it
would
be
a
ridiculous
creamy
rich
milkshake
of
a
beer
not
so
much
hey
what
can
i
say
it
tastes
like
bananas
a
little
the
beer
poured
golden
for
the
most
part
in
color
with
the
head
dissapearing
instantly
the
taste
of
banana
was
there
light
and
not
over
powering
for
those
who
like
a
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
banana
flavor
this
may
be
the
one
for
you
poured
into
a
12oz
acdc
collectors
series
pint
glass
copper
in
color
with
a
1
finger
tan
head
strong
aroma
bursting
with
with
banana
fruits
malt
and
of
course
banana
flavorings
it
does
actually
taste
like
banana
bread
but
a
bit
synthetic
tasting
not
over
powering
at
all
only
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
a
drinkable
beer
but
in
the
end
not
too
outstanding
this
is
a
good
bear
to
pair
with
i
have
to
say
it
banana
bread
drinkability
is
average
but
if
you
really
like
banana
nut
muffins
or
banana
bread
then
crank
up
the
drinkability
higher
a
great
novelty
beer
for
anyone
that
like
bananas
if
you
dont
like
bananas
then
stay
away
banana
bread
poures
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
stayed
throught
the
beer
it
smells
very
sweet
and
very
much
like
banana
the
taste
is
initally
very
sweet
strong
banana
flavors
then
finishes
a
bit
harshly
easy
to
drink
but
the
harsh
aftertase
holds
it
back
overall
enjoyable
if
you
like
bananas
very
unquie
i
would
drink
this
one
again
liquid
banana
bread
like
mom
used
to
make
let
me
at
it
i
was
wary
at
first
with
the
possiblity
of
the
runts
fake
banana
taste
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
taste
was
literally
banana
bread
tasting
nutty
real
ripe
bananas
a
hint
of
nutmeg
and
nothing
overly
sweet
about
it
quite
refreshing
in
fact
that
was
was
what
over
powered
the
brew
but
it
was
thouroghly
enjoyed
d
definitely
a
solid
tasty
brew
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
again
but
seems
to
miss
on
the
banana
somewhat
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
i
have
never
seen
or
even
heard
of
a
banana
beer
so
i
had
to
try
it
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
mildly
average
taste
of
banana
which
is
just
enough
its
light
has
a
very
nice
color
and
aroma
i
bought
two
one
to
drink
and
one
to
store
i
really
wish
i
know
more
about
banana
beers
and
what
kind
of
hops
and
grains
goes
into
this
wells
beer
any
feedback
would
be
great
from
the
25
fl
oz
bottle
no
230311al00830404
sampled
on
september
7
2010
the
pour
is
copperamber
with
a
lot
of
fluffy
tan
head
that
slowly
pops
downward
although
it
remains
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
the
aroma
bursts
with
banana
flavorings
tropical
fruits
and
a
malt
character
the
taste
had
a
solid
bitterness
with
banana
flavorings
mixed
in
it
lives
up
to
its
name
final
thoughts
would
recommend
it
but
personally
would
probably
not
buy
again
banana
banana
banana
and
more
banana
this
is
a
good
once
in
a
great
while
brew
dont
drink
it
everyday
overall
a
very
decent
brew
the
only
reason
i
bought
it
was
for
the
novelty
of
it
you
gotta
try
it
once
with
the
expectations
of
it
being
an
average
brew
that
has
a
banana
flavor
cheers
its
an
okay
ale
but
doesnt
quite
hold
its
own
if
youre
looking
for
a
banana
bread
beer
find
a
decent
dunkel
weiss
and
skip
the
added
and
artificial
flavours
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
little
head
dissipates
quickly
very
nice
carmel
color
the
scent
is
primarily
bananas
ripe
very
appealing
the
taste
is
somewhat
mild
and
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
it
could
almost
pass
as
weak
cream
soda
with
a
bit
of
banana
not
really
bad
an
interesting
beer
to
try
probably
a
one
time
thing
d
i
was
not
expecting
too
much
from
this
beer
to
be
completely
honest
however
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
did
indeed
taste
like
banana
bread
and
was
not
cloying
or
overly
artificial
maybe
this
is
better
in
england
if
so
it
did
not
travel
well
i
bet
wells
can
do
better
and
i
will
be
excited
to
see
them
try
drinkability
pretty
darn
drinkable
i
think
the
novelty
of
the
flavor
and
the
bit
of
sweetness
would
start
to
wear
pretty
thin
on
me
though
after
a
couple
of
pints
this
is
a
very
middleoftheroad
beer
definitely
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
want
too
often
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
ripe
bananas
taste
is
also
dominated
by
bananas
some
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
good
quality
brew
drinkability
although
the
flavor
is
not
as
potent
as
i
would
have
hoped
the
alcohol
is
surprisingly
wellhidden
tastes
is
fairly
good
although
weak
so
overall
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
d
if
there
was
like
an
imperial
or
extra
version
of
this
where
it
was
thicker
and
more
flavorful
i
think
it
would
be
better
overall
it
doesnt
really
taste
bad
but
there
is
something
missing
try
it
one
then
move
on
the
mouth
on
this
is
crisp
carbonation
level
is
moderately
high
decent
body
the
banana
isnt
as
forefront
as
id
have
thought
or
really
wanted
faintly
present
in
the
aftertaste
fresh
breads
take
its
place
a
slight
mineral
twang
on
the
back
end
as
well
faint
english
hop
bite
allinall
this
wasnt
too
bad
not
all
that
i
expected
but
still
decent
i
even
finished
off
the
last
half
of
the
bottle
paired
with
some
actual
banana
bread
why
not
i
like
the
pairing
i
could
see
this
becoming
a
decent
dessert
beer
maybe
with
some
pie
the
flavor
profile
of
the
bananayness
yes
that
is
a
technical
term
was
spot
on
in
the
end
though
the
beer
itself
didnt
hold
up
for
me
list
drinkability
is
poor
not
much
to
like
about
this
strange
brew
lacks
richness
one
would
expect
to
see
from
anything
with
bananas
in
it
and
its
lack
of
body
and
octane
left
me
with
no
reason
to
every
open
another
one
the
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
novelty
but
its
not
bad
was
very
excited
when
i
saw
this
in
the
shop
and
thought
i
should
buy
immediately
apart
from
the
smell
its
been
a
big
disappointment
d
this
beer
drinks
exceptionally
good
for
a
fruit
beer
and
is
not
too
sweet
i
really
use
to
drink
this
brew
on
a
daily
as
a
session
beer
years
ago
beer
i
became
a
beer
advocate
and
i
can
tell
how
my
palate
has
evolved
because
this
beer
was
the
shit
to
me
d
more
of
a
novelty
than
any
kind
of
staple
beer
for
sure
but
it
is
surprising
how
easily
taken
back
this
one
is
i
could
definitely
do
two
in
a
row
before
being
compelled
to
move
on
drinkability
it
is
a
unique
brew
but
definetly
a
good
drinker
worth
a
shot
dan
average
beer
at
least
for
the
curiosity
factor
but
really
nothing
more
than
that
who
doesnt
like
banana
bread
this
beer
is
exactly
what
the
label
says
i
must
say
it
was
quite
enjoyable
i
was
expecting
to
taste
like
odd
fake
banana
flavor
but
it
was
very
tasty
if
you
like
banana
bread
you
should
try
this
beer
it
would
be
nice
to
a
few
of
these
around
for
desert
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
expected
it
to
have
a
sweeter
banana
flavor
pours
an
ambergolden
color
not
much
head
to
it
noticeable
carbonation
the
aroma
was
nice
you
can
definitely
smell
the
banana
the
taste
threw
me
off
mostly
a
lager
but
slightly
more
bitter
had
a
slight
banana
taste
in
the
background
but
i
actually
would
have
liked
more
i
barely
finished
the
whole
thing
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
it
was
much
cheaper
d
well
i
dont
really
know
i
mean
i
guess
if
youre
a
huge
fan
of
banana
bread
then
this
might
be
the
one
for
you
i
am
a
huge
fan
ofbanana
bread
and
i
still
didnt
find
this
the
most
appetizing
of
beers
pretty
much
a
banana
flavored
lager
overall
i
would
recommend
this
simply
because
it
was
interesting
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
everyday
or
once
a
week
but
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
once
a
year
during
winter
i
would
suggest
having
this
as
an
after
dinner
beer
or
with
dessert
not
too
bad
id
have
it
again
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
yeast
banana
hops
and
slight
vanilla
fits
the
style
of
a
fruit
vegetable
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
slight
dryness
noticeable
tastes
of
strong
banana
just
like
banana
flavored
smarties
pale
malt
yeast
slight
grain
and
slight
spice
clove
overall
good
aroma
and
body
poured
a
dark
golden
color
into
tulip
glass
the
smell
of
banana
bread
enters
the
nostrils
the
taste
of
banana
is
definitely
on
the
palate
average
mouthfeel
light
backend
nothing
overwhelming
decent
drinkability
with
a
banana
bread
flavor
overall
a
decent
beer
with
a
banana
taste
d
3
glasses
down
the
drain
should
tell
you
something
lives
up
to
the
name
smells
more
like
banana
than
it
tastes
but
the
flavor
is
present
a
yeasty
bready
flavor
follows
the
initial
banana
taste
not
much
more
to
this
beer
a
tad
stale
on
the
finish
but
a
good
fruit
beer
and
unique
to
say
the
least
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
because
it
leaves
such
a
pleasant
after
taste
that
always
calls
you
back
for
more
overall
it
is
nothing
earthshattering
but
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
different
beer
to
try
d
very
drinkable
for
what
it
is
i
remember
having
this
a
while
back
and
it
being
much
better
more
full
banana
bread
flavor
d
this
was
just
as
expected
clean
and
drinkable
and
quite
unique
its
not
something
i
would
crave
often
but
it
was
nice
to
try
once
overall
glad
i
picked
this
one
off
the
shelf
i
had
seen
it
several
times
but
never
took
the
plunge
because
it
was
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
unless
it
was
on
sale
or
i
had
a
super
craving
for
banana
bread
but
i
dont
feel
that
my
money
was
wasted
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
unless
youve
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
and
want
to
get
drunk
on
several
of
these
otherwise
i
would
never
want
more
than
one
of
this
dessertlike
beer
for
what
they
were
trying
to
go
for
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
but
what
they
were
going
for
may
not
be
the
best
thing
ever
the
color
wasnt
very
attractive
it
is
an
ugly
dull
brownish
orangeish
mess
the
aroma
is
a
lot
stronger
than
i
was
hoping
for
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
smell
exactly
like
banana
bread
but
it
does
just
on
the
nose
there
was
very
little
else
the
initial
taste
is
a
banana
attack
and
a
very
strong
attack
at
that
the
mid
palate
taste
and
even
feels
a
bit
like
butterscotch
which
is
i
think
saves
it
from
being
too
overwhelming
the
finish
is
a
little
watered
down
which
was
actually
quite
pleasant
i
definitely
think
that
this
isnt
a
beer
you
can
drink
often
but
was
exciting
anyway
and
could
probably
be
had
with
some
food
notes
while
i
cant
see
this
being
for
everyone
i
love
banana
bread
and
love
oddlyfull
flavored
beers
so
i
love
this
d
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
even
after
reading
the
reviews
the
smell
was
great
and
really
got
my
hopes
up
but
i
was
disappointed
with
how
weak
the
flavor
was
worth
trying
once
but
amp
up
the
flavor
a
bit
and
i
might
be
more
interested
in
drinking
it
again
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
could
probably
do
more
than
one
d
not
a
big
fan
of
very
strong
fruit
tastes
however
this
one
did
not
turn
me
off
as
i
expected
a
beer
that
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
deliciousness
of
its
name
but
pleasant
and
well
crafted
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
banana
beers
and
this
one
rocked
my
world
i
had
first
discovered
the
world
of
banana
beer
through
a
much
more
subtle
beer
called
el
jefe
weizen
ale
of
hales
ales
i
recently
went
to
my
coop
and
couldnt
find
el
jefe
so
i
tried
this
beer
and
i
now
prefer
it
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
but
i
think
one
is
plenty
not
that
i
didnt
like
the
beer
just
the
banana
flavor
would
get
old
quickly
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
worth
the
wait
i
knew
once
i
opened
the
bottle
that
it
would
be
a
good
one
and
i
would
definitely
buy
again
copper
colored
with
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
lace
smells
of
bananas
gosh
and
a
slight
mineral
smell
tastes
of
bananas
bubbblegum
and
a
slightly
bitter
hops
bite
and
a
touch
of
calcium
the
aftertaste
has
a
touch
of
cinnamon
as
well
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
good
balance
of
the
sweet
with
the
hops
elements
i
like
it
drinkability
while
this
did
capture
the
flavor
of
banana
it
was
the
taste
of
artificial
sweetner
mixed
with
banana
i
went
into
it
with
an
openmind
many
beers
have
banana
undertones
too
much
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
would
not
buy
this
again
drinkability
was
an
interesting
change
of
pace
i
would
compare
this
to
a
fruity
lambic
or
belgian
style
nice
and
sweet
with
some
spice
and
obvious
banana
flavor
could
easily
session
a
few
of
these
although
i
like
fruity
beers
others
might
not
maybe
its
because
my
tastes
memories
are
being
distorted
here
but
the
best
way
i
can
describe
this
beer
is
that
its
southern
tiers
pumking
infused
with
bananas
i
had
this
beer
a
number
of
years
ago
and
since
wells
have
merged
with
youngs
there
are
notable
differences
first
the
banana
taste
is
not
as
long
as
it
originally
was
and
the
beer
is
predominently
more
carbonated
these
days
and
if
i
am
honest
i
would
say
it
is
too
carbonated
having
said
all
this
it
is
still
a
good
drinking
session
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
still
like
it
was
when
it
was
first
brewed
overall
drinkability
isnt
bad
if
you
like
fruity
tasting
beer
i
guess
i
did
like
it
but
wasnt
overly
impressed
d
pretty
decent
brew
definitally
unique
but
not
something
i
would
go
for
all
the
time
i
may
get
some
more
however
just
because
i
really
like
banana
bread
everyone
should
have
this
beer
once
this
beer
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
i
love
banana
bread
but
not
in
my
beer
sorry
this
is
a
one
time
experience
for
me
from
the
bottle
pours
ambercopper
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
slowly
fades
and
is
almost
gone
within
five
minutes
leaving
very
little
but
mainly
no
lacing
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
and
then
some
bananas
and
banana
bread
pretty
spot
on
other
noticeable
aromas
are
spices
the
taste
isnt
as
impressive
as
the
smell
but
in
all
honesty
its
not
blowing
me
away
but
i
do
get
a
good
hint
of
liquid
banana
bread
the
banana
dominates
first
and
is
present
through
out
the
taste
its
followed
by
certain
malt
taste
mainly
caramel
towards
the
end
a
low
abv
this
isnt
a
problem
drinking
this
one
is
good
and
pretty
much
was
advertised
banana
bread
for
sure
but
at
least
its
not
overpowering
in
the
taste
and
you
can
tell
its
a
beer
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
probably
not
that
often
d
lets
just
say
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
this
taste
sweet
malts
with
banana
with
a
slightly
unbalanced
bitterness
there
was
a
slight
astringent
taste
midflavor
that
wasnt
helping
this
beers
case
kind
of
good
and
different
but
not
amazingly
so
d
an
interesting
ale
banana
as
a
sole
ingredient
and
not
a
yeast
byproduct
paint
me
surprised
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
very
much
like
liquid
banana
bread
and
very
interesting
its
not
amazing
but
it
is
enjoybale
on
occasion
i
poured
from
a
16
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
spot
on
big
banana
and
nut
notes
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
banana
bread
but
not
quite
the
banana
is
there
as
is
the
sweetness
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
not
bad
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
and
lightly
carbonated
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
that
i
enjoy
on
occasion
poured
from
a
11
2
fl
oz
bottle
purchased
at
a
six
pack
shop
in
erie
pa
into
a
snifter
color
is
a
caramel
kissed
with
amber
the
head
is
limited
to
a
thin
lining
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
glass
steady
carbonation
the
scent
is
light
but
sweet
with
banana
and
sugar
the
mouth
feel
is
heavily
carbonated
with
powerful
yeast
the
pleasure
of
the
banana
bread
is
loaded
in
the
after
taste
my
first
taste
is
almost
tinny
which
returns
later
after
about
a
dozen
sips
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
that
attempts
a
banana
bread
flavor
but
i
have
to
say
that
the
attempt
is
well
executed
however
even
if
you
are
a
fan
of
banana
bread
stick
with
a
six
pack
and
steer
away
from
the
dedication
to
a
full
case
something
tells
me
that
between
the
yeast
and
the
tinny
flavor
this
beer
would
not
hold
up
well
over
time
holy
banana
batman
this
beer
is
crazy
the
initial
sweetness
of
the
beer
mellows
out
with
a
fine
brown
malt
finish
this
really
does
taste
like
banana
bread
its
pretty
crazy
i
honestly
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
disaster
of
a
bottle
but
i
was
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
balanced
and
tasty
beer
cheers
to
el
nadador
for
finding
this
sexy
beast
a
thin
and
slightly
watery
feel
moderate
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
and
rather
unique
fruit
beer
the
banana
pairs
well
with
the
maltiness
especially
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
fell
a
bit
short
though
being
thin
and
underwhelming
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
in
color
with
a
quarter
inch
frothy
head
and
a
light
lace
smells
of
banana
and
banana
bread
taste
is
sweet
more
candy
like
than
like
banana
bread
flavor
is
right
on
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
ok
wife
gave
me
two
bottles
to
try
its
not
something
i
would
have
bought
thats
the
only
reason
its
being
reviewed
overall
an
interesting
experience
probably
worth
trying
if
one
is
available
tasted
from
bottle
pours
a
light
amber
almost
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
there
are
aromas
of
lightly
toasted
malts
and
you
guessed
it
banana
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
a
sour
aroma
the
slightly
bitter
bit
hits
up
front
and
then
quickly
disappears
the
banana
flavor
is
strong
but
doesnt
really
taste
like
real
banana
something
about
this
beer
reminds
me
of
circus
peanuts
candy
for
some
reason
the
finish
is
a
bitter
that
i
would
not
normally
dislike
but
it
doesnt
match
with
the
other
flavors
very
well
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
this
beer
is
interesting
but
i
would
not
describe
it
as
good
mouthdrink
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
but
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
i
could
only
seeing
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
due
to
real
banana
bread
taste
well
the
brew
poured
into
a
brooklyn
brewery
tulip
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
nice
one
finger
width
head
that
remained
for
quite
some
time
the
smell
is
decent
for
this
brew
however
it
seems
too
artificial
for
my
taste
the
initial
taste
is
that
of
some
bananas
malt
and
surprisingly
hops
cant
say
that
i
was
expecting
the
hops
i
wasnt
to
thrilled
by
the
way
it
meshed
with
the
banana
flavor
in
general
i
think
this
beer
is
a
novelty
however
they
still
need
to
refine
the
recipe
good
beer
bought
on
a
whim
would
probably
buy
again
i
find
the
beer
to
be
enjoyable
but
as
its
abv
may
suggest
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
good
session
beer
but
rather
a
nice
pairing
with
a
dessert
or
possibly
a
fruit
gazpacho
or
fresh
fruit
salad
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
great
its
thin
and
slightly
watery
despite
having
creamy
flavors
i
also
dislike
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
hop
bitterness
but
i
bet
they
would
mute
the
banana
flavors
to
sum
up
i
was
psyched
starting
out
with
this
beer
who
doesnt
want
a
glass
of
liquid
bread
especially
a
yummy
banana
bread
but
after
about
half
a
glass
im
bored
with
the
novelty
of
it
this
beer
loses
me
for
the
same
reason
it
originally
captivated
me
ill
stick
to
eating
my
banana
bread
from
now
on
but
ive
been
thrilled
trying
this
honest
and
tasty
brew
really
overall
a
good
idea
just
not
what
i
expected
wonderful
smell
nutty
and
banana
but
its
not
sweet
and
its
very
light
i
think
i
will
take
a
crack
at
some
thing
like
this
in
my
home
brewing
adventures
more
nuts
more
banana
more
sweetness
and
more
alcohol
d
more
of
a
novelty
beer
than
something
i
would
want
again
and
again
if
you
like
banana
check
this
one
out
if
you
dont
stay
away
drinkability
good
beer
overall
i
definitely
dig
the
banana
flavors
definitely
would
have
this
one
again
drinkability
its
more
of
a
novelty
than
anything
fairly
sessionable
notes
seems
more
like
a
banana
bar
than
banana
bread
due
to
the
sugary
sweetness
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
gimmicky
type
of
beer
and
pretty
good
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
it
i
like
the
idea
but
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
bread
and
a
bit
less
sugar
banana
flavor
isnt
intense
and
it
taste
generally
like
a
banana
with
just
a
slight
artificial
taste
artificial
taste
seems
to
follow
the
taste
of
a
real
banana
just
a
bit
stronger
and
sweeter
drinkability
this
is
a
hard
one
the
flavour
does
not
lend
itself
to
a
session
drink
but
im
thinking
that
pairing
with
a
good
banana
and
chocolate
dessert
a
few
bottles
could
go
down
very
well
d
its
a
good
thing
i
didnt
pick
up
a
case
because
i
really
dont
seem
to
like
it
good
novelty
beer
though
d
if
it
was
not
so
pricey
would
have
one
every
day
as
desertdid
i
say
yet
mmmm
d
very
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
expensive
it
would
be
a
good
standard
to
have
a
stock
of
just
for
something
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
its
the
only
banana
beer
ive
had
and
the
banana
flavor
goes
surprisingly
well
with
the
pale
ale
base
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
if
you
run
across
it
definitely
give
it
a
try
overall
its
pretty
good
for
a
banana
beer
i
wouldnt
know
what
more
to
ask
for
deep
golden
body
bordering
on
copper
very
clear
thin
off
white
head
sporadic
lace
smells
like
a
banana
flavored
popsicle
oh
i
used
to
really
like
those
flavor
has
imitation
written
all
over
it
very
artificial
tasting
confectionary
like
banana
extract
comes
to
mind
looks
like
they
used
real
bananas
but
it
tastes
like
imitation
not
a
lot
of
other
beer
traits
to
talk
about
maybe
a
little
caramel
malt
to
me
this
is
not
that
good
ive
only
had
one
other
banana
bread
beer
and
it
was
much
better
town
hall
far
too
sweet
for
me
and
rather
unbalanced
and
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
something
that
would
go
well
with
it
while
the
banana
bread
part
was
pulled
off
exceptionally
well
this
remains
a
novelty
been
for
me
kind
of
circus
like
in
that
it
is
enjoyable
but
only
every
couple
of
years
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
along
with
food
you
need
something
to
take
the
bitter
aftertaste
out
of
your
mouth
quickly
and
to
complement
the
bananas
i
ate
candied
walnuts
and
they
improved
the
beer
a
lot
flavor
is
like
your
average
crisp
carbonated
ale
followed
by
a
long
lasting
banana
aftertaste
banana
flavor
is
overall
light
which
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
heavy
banana
sweetness
but
alas
not
at
all
once
again
pretty
mild
light
mouthfeel
not
overly
sweet
not
bad
d
low
im
not
sure
banana
is
actually
soluble
in
water
so
artificial
flavoring
seems
likely
although
the
label
indicates
that
fairtrade
bananas
were
used
right
a
handful
of
bananas
and
a
gallon
of
banana
flavoring
value
the
worst
thing
about
this
beer
i
paid
4
99
for
a
bottle
should
be
priced
at
half
that
the
lightness
extends
to
the
alcohol
which
can
hardly
be
felt
here
polishing
off
one
of
these
wouldnt
be
that
hard
to
accomplish
in
terms
of
how
strong
it
is
but
it
takes
too
long
for
the
europeanlike
hops
in
the
back
to
kick
in
worth
a
try
once
only
because
i
have
yet
to
find
anything
out
there
remotely
close
to
this
incredible
aroma
but
stops
there
and
goes
downhill
quickly
as
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
taste
and
body
to
back
it
up
definitely
cannot
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
m
d
too
light
on
structure
and
too
heavy
on
co2
perhaps
a
passable
hotweather
thirst
quencher
but
not
suitable
for
serious
ale
drinking
nothing
very
objectionable
but
nothing
inspiring
either
d
its
good
but
would
only
be
willing
to
drink
one
of
theses
it
would
pair
well
with
some
foods
and
is
unique
a
good
change
of
pace
in
short
this
beer
is
entirely
hampered
by
what
it
purports
to
be
banana
bread
beer
d
i
would
drink
it
asgai
many
times
i
would
session
it
and
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
give
to
that
annoying
female
friend
you
have
who
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
it
again
but
its
better
than
some
beer
d
pretty
nice
as
an
apertif
or
dessert
brew
as
well
as
pairing
fantastically
with
banana
bread
spice
cake
or
banana
nut
muffin
as
far
as
wells
entry
goes
its
a
thumbs
down
for
me
which
is
too
bad
because
the
idea
is
a
good
one
and
i
do
like
banana
bread
maybe
the
beer
is
poorly
executed
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
maybe
my
taste
buds
dont
know
sht
or
maybe
a
banana
bread
beer
is
just
not
meant
to
be
after
all
i
like
pizza
too
but
a
pepperoni
and
sausage
ale
would
surely
fail
from
the
start
its
certainly
worth
trying
and
its
not
bad
at
all
still
id
rather
have
a
slice
of
banana
bread
preferably
with
some
cream
cheese
on
top
and
a
beer
on
the
side
preferably
not
at
the
same
time
but
who
knows
if
you
like
banana
bread
then
definitely
try
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
get
more
than
a
bottle
d
despite
low
abv
this
would
be
tough
to
finish
1
due
to
crazy
and
not
terribly
attractive
flavors
d
i
like
it
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
feels
a
little
under
carbonated
and
not
as
full
as
a
beer
whose
claim
is
bananna
bread
ill
keep
this
one
short
and
to
the
point
cloudy
yellow
golden
body
with
a
big
bubbled
ivory
head
the
smell
is
mostly
overripe
banana
sugar
and
a
toasty
malt
character
as
well
the
taste
is
the
opposite
of
robust
muted
over
carbonated
banana
soda
with
a
shot
of
booze
in
the
back
lacking
overall
and
very
average
if
not
below
d
went
down
very
easily
due
to
the
sweetness
and
low
alcohol
which
was
completely
hidden
in
the
fruitiness
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
beer
but
easily
finished
it
with
no
hesitation
if
you
need
a
potassium
fix
while
drinking
i
havent
found
the
content
but
this
may
be
the
thing
for
you
very
good
drinkability
sure
drinkability
very
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
it
was
a
very
interesting
beer
and
definitely
something
different
i
would
definitely
buy
another
bottle
banana
period
has
a
distinctive
banana
smell
on
the
pour
but
not
overpowering
you
actually
have
to
put
your
nose
to
the
glass
not
like
you
can
smell
it
from
a
foot
away
or
anything
has
a
distinctive
banana
taste
and
finish
that
is
pleasant
its
not
overpowering
banana
this
is
one
of
the
few
specialty
beers
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
at
one
sitting
but
it
is
a
little
thin
drinkability
averageminus
overall
nice
novelty
but
not
so
great
on
the
execution
drinkability
here
comes
the
problem
its
an
absolutely
gimmick
beer
much
like
pumking
is
yes
it
succeeds
in
tasting
like
banana
bread
but
after
a
while
it
gets
to
be
too
much
and
i
love
banana
bread
this
is
a
one
time
kind
of
beer
that
i
dont
think
id
have
again
but
it
is
worth
a
try
it
was
pretty
drinkable
but
i
cant
imagine
making
a
day
of
it
overall
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
maybe
not
a
everyday
drinker
but
very
unique
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
smooth
drinkability
is
fine
after
all
its
a
fruit
beer
just
that
damn
aftertaste
16
9oz
bottle
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
features
a
good
amount
of
banana
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
less
banana
flavor
but
it
is
still
evident
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
tha
is
definitely
worth
a
try
surprise
this
is
smooth
with
a
hell
of
a
bannana
after
taste
could
not
shake
the
bannana
taste
from
my
mouth
would
never
have
more
than
one
of
these
tasty
drinkable
but
truly
a
novelty
beer
not
something
to
go
back
to
multiple
times
over
drinkability
very
nice
i
would
and
will
definitely
drink
this
again
surpisingly
hop
forward
with
a
some
nice
floral
characetr
the
flavor
is
again
dominated
by
a
sugary
sweet
banana
flavor
slightly
bready
medium
body
which
is
pretty
crisp
and
clean
with
some
biscuit
nutty
malt
kind
of
a
silly
gimmick
but
actually
succeeds
in
tasting
like
banana
bread
i
tried
this
beer
at
a
winterfestival
this
past
weekend
and
was
blown
away
by
the
overall
pleasant
drinking
experience
it
gave
me
we
all
knew
it
would
smell
great
and
look
ok
but
tatse
wow
its
great
its
not
syrupy
or
overwhelming
like
banana
first
ale
second
no
no
this
one
is
done
correctly
ale
first
banana
second
i
think
after
a
nice
bitterly
smooth
ale
kick
the
banana
fades
into
the
back
of
ur
tastebuds
perfect
my
suggestion
try
with
youngs
dbl
choc
stout
u
guessed
it
banana
split
enjoy
to
all
for
something
different
try
this
i
will
again
oh
my
god
wow
this
is
so
delicious
you
think
you
dont
like
fruit
flavored
beers
dont
be
lame
you
like
banana
bread
right
this
tastes
like
banana
bread
it
also
smells
like
banana
bread
how
can
that
possibly
be
bad
not
only
that
but
the
underlying
ale
is
good
too
but
this
banana
taste
is
just
brilliant
overall
the
novelty
of
it
is
by
far
the
most
appealing
aspect
that
and
the
smell
poured
an
amber
color
with
an
ok
head
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
bananas
right
away
a
little
spice
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
banana
bread
all
the
way
with
some
cinnamon
and
caramrl
malt
in
the
background
i
also
detect
some
apples
and
pears
the
mouthfeel
is
to
much
banana
it
overwhelms
this
beer
its
all
im
tasting
however
it
is
one
to
try
its
just
not
one
to
have
to
often
dshared
it
with
my
wife
she
said
she
would
drink
it
all
night
i
onthe
other
hand
would
be
cool
after
the
first
and
then
switch
it
up
notes
this
one
is
worth
trying
its
different
and
a
good
unique
flavor
experience
i
scroe
this
a
4
0
on
drinkability
for
a
fruit
brew
it
reminded
me
of
an
banana
laced
cider
not
overly
sweet
or
too
fruit
intense
good
for
one
maybe
mix
half
with
a
stout
for
a
twist
but
count
me
out
on
a
second
round
good
for
something
different
try
a
slash
in
a
stout
sometime
it
may
surprise
you
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
who
doesnt
love
banana
bread
not
surprisingly
there
was
slight
aromas
of
banana
and
caramel
the
hops
leave
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
that
affects
how
many
i
would
want
to
have
in
a
sitting
i
dont
mind
slightly
bitter
beers
but
in
my
opinion
a
banana
bread
expierence
should
have
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
i
would
recomend
this
brew
i
just
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
after
already
trying
it
cheers
there
is
a
bit
more
banana
nut
bread
balance
to
the
beer
upon
tasting
the
banana
flavor
is
a
bit
more
natural
and
the
nutty
malts
show
up
a
bit
along
with
a
toastily
bittering
finish
that
seems
to
be
helped
along
by
a
touch
of
leafy
hops
i
cant
help
but
think
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
this
seems
to
be
a
style
that
screams
for
a
viscous
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
tad
more
sweetness
its
an
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
for
sure
but
the
novelty
wears
off
pretty
quick
overall
nicely
balanced
and
interestingwould
make
a
fine
dessert
beer
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
at
first
but
pleasantly
surprised
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
for
an
interesting
and
different
taste
experience
drinkability
this
is
the
most
banana
i
have
had
in
a
nonhefe
i
like
the
fruit
flavor
on
top
of
the
dry
beer
it
is
a
nice
change
from
fruit
beer
that
can
taste
too
much
like
syrup
i
would
have
this
again
but
two
is
the
most
i
will
have
in
a
sitting
i
do
not
get
the
advertised
bread
taste
and
certainly
no
nutty
taste
either
which
i
am
used
to
on
banana
bread
not
much
head
on
the
unique
bottle
pour
this
intrigued
me
and
i
was
expecting
a
belgien
type
but
this
was
more
of
an
ale
with
banana
flavoring
very
unique
and
good
big
banana
aroma
with
an
acidic
mouthfeel
and
banana
notes
this
is
a
beer
to
have
one
of
but
not
a
session
beer
good
though
if
you
are
into
that
flavor
profile
if
this
were
served
at
the
ebf
folks
would
rave
about
it
i
think
it
is
extreme
this
kind
of
tastes
like
banana
bread
at
first
but
then
it
doesnt
taste
like
banana
bread
it
has
this
weird
bitter
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
beer
after
the
weird
beer
flavor
it
starts
to
taste
like
banana
bread
again
but
then
the
beer
flavor
combines
with
the
banana
bread
flavor
and
it
tastes
like
someone
made
banana
bread
with
beer
instead
of
water
which
is
just
a
stupid
idea
if
youre
going
to
make
banana
bread
do
it
right
and
leave
the
beer
out
of
it
i
dont
know
why
you
love
this
stuff
so
much
nickd717
and
im
never
trusting
your
opinion
on
banana
bread
again
i
love
banana
bread
so
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
definitely
something
unique
to
me
id
definitely
get
this
brew
again
despite
my
reservations
im
fairly
happy
with
it
it
has
a
great
opening
there
are
pleasant
surprises
but
youd
better
down
it
while
its
still
got
its
legs
youd
better
drink
it
cold
on
a
really
hot
day
its
certainly
worth
trying
if
only
for
the
novelty
value
will
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
but
ill
have
one
if
youre
buying
drinkability
is
high
but
that
doesnt
count
for
much
with
me
these
days
just
because
i
can
drink
12
of
them
doesnt
mean
i
want
to
ill
pass
next
time
i
see
this
one
not
my
style
but
it
is
a
treat
overall
okay
as
a
novelty
but
thats
about
it
might
work
out
paired
in
small
portions
with
fried
bananas
but
otherwise
i
cant
imagine
buying
this
again
o
worth
a
try
but
not
an
outstanding
discovery
id
probably
drink
it
again
happily
if
it
was
an
option
in
a
slim
pickings
shop
overall
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
overly
impressive
i
do
however
highly
recommended
trying
this
beer
very
interesting
beer
but
i
think
it
would
have
worked
better
with
something
like
a
wheat
beer
im
sorry
wells
banana
bread
beer
i
wanted
it
to
work
its
not
you
its
me
we
could
still
be
friends
crystal
clear
and
bright
copper
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
big
creamy
head
that
settles
rather
quickly
yeasty
and
bready
homebrew
smell
with
fading
cooked
banana
notes
taste
very
frontloaded
with
lots
of
overripe
banana
sweetness
and
malty
sweetness
underneath
flavor
fades
quickly
leaving
little
but
faint
and
tangy
fruit
flavors
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
little
to
no
hop
characteristics
body
is
medium
to
light
feeling
very
thin
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
no
lacing
taste
is
as
the
nose
the
bana
taste
is
unique
though
it
tastes
much
like
fake
banana
both
the
banana
aroma
and
taste
remind
me
so
much
of
the
banana
runts
an
amber
with
fake
banana
not
something
id
buy
again
i
suppose
purchased
from
ottos
wine
cask
in
brown
deer
wi
pours
a
dark
golden
body
with
a
white
head
of
foam
that
falls
aromas
of
bold
fruity
esters
and
big
banana
smell
too
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
malt
flavor
to
compliment
the
banana
flavors
this
is
pretty
good
at
first
but
the
novelty
wears
off
about
half
way
through
too
much
banana
flavor
leaves
me
wanting
to
switch
to
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
beer
d
im
kind
of
confused
is
this
a
candyshot
or
is
this
beer
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
it
was
an
interesting
experience
never
the
less
d
drinkable
i
could
probably
enjoy
2
bottles
in
a
sitting
before
the
overwhelming
maltiness
got
to
me
overall
i
like
the
idea
here
but
not
the
followthrough
it
needs
waaay
more
malt
flavor
and
more
spices
to
justify
its
name
this
is
not
a
banana
bread
beer
its
a
banana
flavored
lager
d
not
sure
about
a
young
example
but
this
goes
down
super
easy
right
now
refreshing
clean
good
banana
but
not
overdone
pleasantly
surprised
an
interesting
beer
and
one
thats
good
as
a
crossover
beer
not
one
i
would
typically
buy
but
it
was
fun
wells
banana
bread
beer
how
can
you
walk
past
a
beer
with
that
kind
of
name
in
the
store
ive
been
eyeing
it
for
a
while
even
though
i
usually
think
that
fruit
beers
are
a
terrible
idea
i
had
to
try
this
one
i
never
say
i
regret
drinking
a
beer
and
i
dont
regret
drinking
this
beer
but
it
is
close
to
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
found
myself
debating
whether
it
was
an
ale
or
a
lager
half
way
through
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
yellow
nearly
flat
so
no
carbonation
at
all
no
head
overwhelming
smell
of
bananas
but
not
the
fruit
bananas
think
banana
runts
surprisingly
it
did
not
taste
a
lot
like
bananas
although
each
time
i
burped
they
tasted
like
bananas
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
thin
the
aftertaste
of
the
beer
was
stronger
than
the
taste
the
aftertaste
was
that
of
a
poorly
made
kolsch
on
the
bottle
they
wrotelong
ago
ale
was
known
as
liquid
bread
weve
used
our
long
history
of
creating
the
finest
malt
blends
and
added
fairtrade
bananas
to
awaken
the
senses
with
a
seriously
fruity
rich
yet
surprisingly
versatile
banana
bread
beer
lies
all
lies
dont
bother
with
this
beer
it
was
close
to
undrinkable
oelergud
anyone
who
has
to
witness
every
use
of
the
banana
firsthand
i
wont
be
having
another
one
soon

its

im
willing
to
forgive
its
cutesiness
since
it
was

of

bananas
b
a
n
a
n
a
s
it
is
probably
one
of
the
most
over
powering
banana
smells
i
have
been
around
the
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
and
that
is
bananas
there
is
really
no
malt
or
bread
notes
to
balance
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
there
is
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
drink
alot
of
these
you
would
have
to
really
want
it
in
small
does
this
would
be
a
good
beer
however
you
couldnt
take
in
big
doses
taste
sweet
and
smooth
upfront
spicy
hops
and
moderate
bitterness
in
the
middle
crisp
finish
and
a
little
banana
aftertaste
to
round
out
the
experience
i
wish
it
had
a
bigger
banana
taste
that
is
the
whole
gimmick
afterall
might
as
well
have
taken
it
to
the
extreme
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
one
finger
head
that
laced
very
well
reeks
of
candy
bananas
but
i
guess
that
was
to
be
expected
there
do
seem
to
be
some
hop
aroma
and
a
touch
of
malt
at
the
back
but
its
all
about
the
bananas
a
little
awkward
on
the
palate
starts
off
sweet
and
bananary
but
has
some
malt
beer
body
bringing
up
the
rear
throwing
it
off
then
those
banana
lolly
notes
hang
around
for
a
while
probably
wouldve
been
better
as
a
sweet
banana
beer
light
in
body
in
the
vein
of
some
fruit
lambics
not
horrible
but
once
is
more
than
enough
for
me
kind
of
tastes
like
what
was
the
point
the
banana
really
dominates
this
beer
it
has
rather
a
dairy
flavour
to
it
reminding
me
of
angel
delight
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
finish
but
that
isnt
uncommon
with
banana
generally
im
very
picky
about
bananas
yet
find
this
surprisingly
decent
d
again
a
very
underwhelming
fruit
beer
i
wish
brewers
would
incorporate
fruit
into
the
beer
better
instead
being
a
fruit
centered
beer
drinkability
overall
it
is
what
it
is
but
its
not
good
plenty
of
other
better
fruity
options
for
beer
out
there
d
this
is
not
a
good
beer
but
still
not
as
horrible
as
i
had
suspected
dont
know
if
a
banana
infused
english
ale
is
a
good
idea
what
so
ever
so
i
think
this
one
was
doomed
to
fail
no
matter
what
it
tasted
like
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
the
brewerys
got
better
offerings
than
this
my
inner
child
caused
me
to
reach
for
it
on
a
whim
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
except
a
single
bottle
for
a
tasting
meant
to
show
people
the
interesting
things
you
can
do
with
beer
taking
out
the
metal
taste
would
help
but
there
needs
to
be
a
better
layering
of
flavors
here
dvery
strong
on
the
fruit
end
but
not
the
bread
end
i
would
like
to
have
had
a
bit
more
balance
solid
atmosphere
really
nice
appearance
and
nose
is
definitely
banana
but
not
overwhelming
as
to
drown
out
whats
left
subtle
balanced
flavor
again
not
all
banana
good
feel
although
not
something
id
want
to
drink
everyday
overall
pretty
solid
quaff
drinkability
im
hoping
my
wife
likes
this
more
than
me
reminds
me
of
banana
bread
but
in
an
artificial
sense
decent
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
desert
beer
or
possibly
a
pairing
with
actual
banana
bread
probably
wont
reach
for
one
to
relax
with
on
a
warm
summer
night
however
the
beer
is
interesting
and
actually
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
it
to
be
i
enjoy
this
but
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
worth
the
experience
imo
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
fizzy
white
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
ripe
bananas
obviously
but
not
overpowering
bread
malts
with
a
twinge
of
bitterness
providing
a
decent
balance
flavor
is
very
similar
bananas
maybe
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
and
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
dry
carbonated
light
and
the
astringency
sticks
around
for
a
while
not
necessarily
my
cup
of
tea
but
a
decent
and
drinkable
beer
fairly
well
balanced
considering
the
use
of
banana
dont
know
if
id
drink
it
again
i
might
but
i
doubt
it
intersting
taste
not
at
all
bad
but
not
something
id
seek
out
and
drink
regularly
or
even
occassionally
i
just
prefer
other
styles
no
fault
of
the
brew
ruby
colored
white
head
with
little
retention
and
little
lacing
smell
is
all
banana
bread
its
like
having
a
piece
of
it
tucked
into
the
glass
some
maltiness
tucked
in
there
with
the
banana
aroma
taste
is
more
banana
but
not
balanced
taste
is
a
real
downer
from
the
smell
too
many
things
going
on
too
many
flavors
kind
of
tannic
like
throughout
finish
is
quite
dry
this
beer
would
be
better
suited
to
cooking
than
drinking
dr
certainly
now
if
there
was
only
a
way
to
get
some
walnuts
in
there
i
like
beer
and
i
like
banana
bread
so
i
figured
this
beer
would
be
a
home
run
however
i
bought
this
with
some
trepidation
because
fruit
beers
can
get
too
overpowered
by
the
fruit
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
as
the
head
struggled
to
form
on
top
so
did
my
expectations
the
aroma
was
just
what
it
should
be
bananas
not
much
hops
or
malt
aromas
if
any
surprisingly
the
taste
was
good
no
lacing
from
the
lackluster
head
but
bananas
was
obvious
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
wasnt
a
home
home
run
maybe
a
stand
up
triple
i
had
very
low
expectations
for
this
beer
but
i
was
plesantly
surprised
i
have
tried
other
fruit
beers
before
and
this
one
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
as
the
name
states
this
beer
does
not
just
smell
like
banana
but
it
smells
exactly
like
banana
bread
the
banana
taste
was
not
overpowering
beautiful
color
and
good
appearance
head
disapated
quickly
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
i
will
definatly
buy
this
beer
again
this
was
a
beer
that
upon
my
first
sighting
it
in
my
local
beer
joint
i
promptly
scratched
my
head
and
said
what
the
it
was
quite
an
interesting
concept
and
a
pleasure
to
try
my
two
main
gripes
1
a
heavier
mouthfeel
seemed
more
appropriate
to
me
2
too
much
banana
it
has
a
good
base
but
some
more
balance
would
have
been
nice
still
the
novelty
alone
makes
this
worth
trying
drinkable
i
didnt
even
manage
to
drink
half
of
the
bottle
not
entirely
novelty
but
not
a
beer
youd
designate
as
an
every
day
goto
beer
either
id
wanted
to
try
this
for
some
time
as
the
idea
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
while
this
is
no
grand
slam
it
does
well
enoughbut
ill
bet
dogfish
head
could
really
do
something
amazing
with
this
concept
i
thank
bdlbrewster
for
the
opportunity
to
try
a
bottle
cheers
matt
poured
from
a
brown
glass
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
theres
a
nice
smell
dominated
by
banana
the
taste
is
plenty
of
banana
but
not
much
else
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
i
like
the
idea
of
a
banana
infused
beer
but
this
one
just
doesnt
really
live
up
to
potential
this
beer
pours
a
light
orange
with
an
ivory
colored
head
foam
shrinks
down
to
a
thick
film
good
retention
smell
is
amazingly
like
banana
bread
the
banana
smells
realistic
not
overly
sweet
fake
flavoring
also
some
toasted
bready
malt
taste
has
lots
of
banana
as
well
again
naturally
tasting
there
is
some
solid
caramel
malt
that
keeps
it
from
getting
to
sweet
a
bit
of
spice
finish
cinnamon
maybe
no
real
hop
bitterness
but
dont
miss
it
anyways
i
would
say
mediumbody
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
original
and
unique
for
sure
exactly
as
advertised
definately
worth
a
try
but
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
d
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
for
what
its
worth
below
average
drinkability
for
my
tastes
somewhat
high
abv
of
5
2
artificial
tastes
whats
the
point
well
ill
be
im
really
quite
surprised
how
spot
on
this
beverage
nailed
the
experience
of
biting
into
banana
nut
bread
except
its
not
overflowing
with
flavor
and
strangely
dry
which
counters
the
desired
moistness
youd
want
from
the
bread
drinkability
even
though
i
thoroughly
detest
bananas
and
their
wimp
flavours
in
their
original
form
i
decided
to
put
that
aside
and
review
this
one
from
a
neutral
stand
point
thus
the
disappointment
lies
not
in
the
choice
of
flavouring
but
in
the
fact
that
it
is
all
too
weak
and
bland
conclusion
a
for
effort
intent
and
originality
the
execution
not
quite
so
great
it
tastes
like
what
its
supposed
to
thats
certain
this
could
be
pretty
damn
good
if
the
banana
intensity
was
just
ratcheted
down
a
touch
and
if
that
odd
bitter
somewhat
metallic
bite
wasnt
there
on
the
finish
still
worth
a
try
at
least
once
smells
like
a
banana
but
the
banana
taste
is
not
too
strong
the
taste
is
creamy
with
banana
but
not
over
powered
by
the
banana
the
beer
had
a
foamy
head
with
large
soapy
type
bubbles
it
is
a
good
change
of
pace
but
not
something
you
could
drink
all
night
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
a
nice
beer
definitely
unique
and
enjoyable
i
was
interested
in
trying
this
fruitbased
beer
knowing
it
was
a
gimmick
of
sorts
that
being
said
it
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
beer
and
seeing
as
it
only
distributed
in
singles
at
4
50
a
pop
i
cant
say
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
but
then
again
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
one
bottle
on
hand
since
i
enjoy
youngs
double
chocolate
and
mixing
the
banana
bread
beer
for
a
black
and
tan
is
a
decent
concoction
though
i
think
it
is
the
ydc
that
makes
the
concoction
delicious
and
not
so
much
the
banana
bread
beer
damn
this
smells
so
incredibly
good
and
i
even
have
a
bit
of
a
cold
i
could
seriously
imagine
just
buying
it
again
just
to
smell
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
fruitstyle
beers
though
some
can
be
great
one
of
my
biggest
issues
was
the
carbonation
on
cask
or
nitro
this
would
be
more
fun
im
sure
that
said
i
still
think
the
flavor
was
rather
lacking
or
missing
something
though
probably
the
smell
had
made
me
hope
that
this
would
just
be
liquid
banana
bread
or
something
an
interesting
beer
worth
giving
a
try
but
a
novelty
nonetheless
damn
banana
actually
pretty
weak
not
that
i
was
wanting
anything
overpowerful
but
nothing
is
there
to
accent
it
well
little
bit
of
hops
but
thats
about
it
disappointed
my
wife
really
wanted
to
try
it
too
but
almost
spit
out
her
taste
i
finished
the
bottle
but
that
will
be
the
last
really
interesting
beer
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
its
not
really
my
favorite
but
i
do
love
the
banana
flavor
this
is
a
beer
that
i
had
been
thinking
about
buying
for
a
couple
of
months
but
waited
until
a
friend
of
mine
gave
it
the
seal
of
approval
probably
not
for
everyone
but
you
never
know
how
much
youll
like
or
dislike
something
until
you
try
it
this
is
an
interesting
one
to
try
what
excites
me
most
about
this
beer
is
the
prospect
of
food
pairings
i
think
it
would
suit
equally
as
a
dessert
beer
or
as
a
light
fresh
foil
to
spicy
dishes
curries
mexican
etc
drinkability
despite
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
nothing
offensive
in
the
flavor
just
not
what
i
expected
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
frothy
but
somewhat
fizzy
beige
head
nice
pure
banana
oil
aroma
similar
to
banana
flavored
candy
i
also
get
some
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
flavor
has
some
banana
but
its
more
pithy
than
sweet
and
theres
not
a
lot
of
it
in
the
first
place
an
earthy
hoppiness
and
bready
malts
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
presumably
because
the
base
beer
is
an
esb
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
a
beer
named
after
a
rich
and
chewy
confection
carbonation
is
a
little
too
high
not
bad
d
good
but
this
gimmicky
beer
is
much
less
sessionable
than
many
others
like
it
within
its
style
d
its
pretty
drinkable
but
not
very
interesting
not
one
id
buy
again
if
you
want
a
banana
flavored
beer
try
ayinger
dopplebock
the
taste
is
light
byt
flavourful
a
definite
but
light
banana
element
throughout
with
earthy
leaves
and
tea
some
tasted
grain
esp
in
the
finish
it
is
dryish
with
light
sweetness
dominated
by
peppery
bitterness
that
lingers
around
the
mouth
for
a
long
time
its
light
crisp
a
bit
watery
but
actually
prwetty
good
and
interesting
m
d
kinda
medium
body
sizzly
carbonation
like
soda
again
fairly
easy
drinking
but
not
all
that
great
cant
say
im
a
fan
but
the
flavour
isnt
drainpour
worthy
nice
idea
but
i
wont
be
having
this
again
overall
a
nice
treat
but
not
a
regular
standby
if
im
feeling
like
something
fruity
i
might
go
for
it
the
beer
is
good
and
worth
its
price
only
problem
is
that
its
a
little
bit
too
obvoius
that
it
was
flavored
mostly
with
artificial
banana
flavoring
worth
trying
but
i
wont
get
it
again
the
labeling
is
impressive
like
most
youngs
bottles
are
for
a
beer
as
light
as
it
was
it
was
not
too
carbony
but
it
still
tasted
felt
like
gas
and
not
natural
carbonation
i
payed
3
69
for
mine
but
ive
seen
em
as
high
as
5
99
bottom
line
thoughits
just
a
light
beer
with
banana
flavoring
nothing
to
special
drinkability
although
this
isnt
what
id
hoped
for
it
remains
a
fairly
wellbalanced
and
definitely
refreshing
beer
d
medium
drinkability
i
guess
if
it
were
the
only
thing
amongst
buds
and
millers
i
might
go
to
it
first
but
wont
search
it
out
m
thin
bodied
consistency
of
water
with
just
a
little
more
viscosity
not
entirely
impressive
on
its
own
but
goes
well
with
the
rest
of
the
qualities
of
the
beer
d
this
particular
beverage
may
have
suffered
from
the
hype
i
put
on
it
but
i
was
not
impressed
and
wont
be
buying
another
i
failed
to
find
much
by
way
of
redeeming
qualities
d
this
is
okay
for
a
novelty
and
i
could
see
using
it
in
a
mixed
drink
or
in
cooking
but
not
really
a
beer

makes
you

to

when
you
serve
this
cold
it
is
actually
a

difficult
to
detect
the
banana
presence
but
as
it
warms
the
banana
definitely
becomes
much
more
pronounced
just
dont
let
it
get
too
warm
because
it
did
get
a
little
out
of
hand
towards
the
end
this
was
worth
a
try
and
i
can
appreciate
it
as
a
specialty
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
be
drinking
too
many
of
these
i
dont
know
anybody
whod
be
buying
a
whole
case
of
this
but
for
a
one
time
treat
this
was
an
interesting
thing
to
try
the
color
is
a

there
was
a
small
head
that
quickly
vanished
decent
banana
aroma
tastes
somewhat
like
banana
bread
but
overall
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
weak
there
was
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
more
than
1
pint
of
this
beer
would
be
too
much
i
guess
its
worth
trying
for
the
novelty
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
it
to
be
overall
i
thought
this
was
quite
tasty
fruit
beers
can
be
dicey
but
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
and
then
bitter
flavors
of
this
one
certainly
worth
a
try

you
are

else

but
this
will
be
my
last
not
to
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
almost
like
a
heavier
and
sweeter
hefe
such
a
specialized
flavor
i
cant
see
drinking
it
often
but
worth
a
try
i
wanted
this
to
be
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
the
label
makes
reference
to
beer
as
liquid
bread
and
posits
that
banana
bread
beer
is
then
a
logical
conclusion
ill
buy
that
without
a
slightly
richer
and
fresher
body
as
the
cask
version
demonstrated
but
it
has
several
boring
characteristics
this
all
makes
it
an
easily
drinkable
beer
some

remains
smell
is
nice
it
actually
smells
like
banana
bread
out

ripe

its
just
not
all
that

i
could
drink
a

once

just

off
the

bread
but
flavors
lack
balance
and
left
me
disappointed
this
beer
isnt
poison
but
its
nothing
special
either
very
unimpressive
well
this
is
a
try
one
time
kind
of
beer
too
many
esters
here
should
have
based
this
off
a
bock
or
wheat
beer
d
given
the
name
i
had
high
hopes
for
an
interesting
beer
and
despite
the
breakfast
sounding
name
i
found
this
beer
isnt
much
for
any
time
of
day
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
good
lacing
and
retention
yes
the
smell
is
about
bananas
but
what
do
you
expect
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
bitter
and
maltier
than
i
envisioned
the
bananas
are
pronounced
and
it
does
have
a
bready
or
earthy
tone
to
it
but
i
wasnt
expecting
this
level
of
bitterness
as
the
beer
warms
it
mellows
a
bit
is
less
bitter
and
more
warming
banana
notes
come
through
overall
the
beer
isnt
bad
worth
trying
and
enjoyable
but
it
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
youll
be
drinking
lots
of
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
the
aftertaste
slightly
tart
and
as
one
reviewer
mentioned
it
does
have
some
characteristics
of
what
you
would
find
in
a
pumpkin
ale
in
terms
of
the
bitternessspiciness
in
the
middle
1
pint
3
25
oz
bottle
the
brew
pours
a
nice
golden
to
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
very
dense
head
over
top
clarity
is
very
good
and
there
is
a
very
steady
curtain
of
bubbles
visible
the
aroma
is
nice
sweet
banana
with
caramel
blended
in
there
along
with
a
doughy
malt
base
i
have
to
say
that
this
one
smells
like
what
it
says
it
is
taking
a
sip
i
get
a
more
earthy
banana
kinda
like
a
bruised
banana
flavor
with
a
more
substantial
dough
and
breadyness
to
the
malt
what
surprises
me
most
is
the
strength
of
the
hop
in
both
flavor
and
bitterness
it
is
nice
and
herbal
and
very
pleasant
in
the
bitterness
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
rest
of
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
very
healthy
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
of
fine
bubbles
it
almost
as
a
bot
of
a
creamy
texture
as
well
overall
i
have
to
give
them
credit
for
making
this
one
truly
a
banana
bread
beer
i
think
the
hop
profile
doesnt
fit
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
i
think
the
banana
is
balanced
and
not
overdone
in
the
brew
i
poured
this
interesting
beer
into
a
tubler
at
50
degrees
it
was
a
nice
amberish
color
and
kinda
looked
pinky
also
maybe
it
was
the
light
it
was
night
it
had
a
nice
fine
bubbly
head
and
really
smelled
like
bananas
it
also
really
tasted
like
bananas
i
thought
it
was
interesting
and
really
not
bad
i
most
likely
will
not
buy
it
again
but
i
think
you
should
try
it
it
is
interesting
this
is
interesting
enough
to
try
once
i
cant
say
it
misses
the
mark
completely
though
i
do
with
that
the
banana
and
bread
came
together
more
completely
while
retaining
some
of
the
nutty
quality
to
give
it
some
depth
anyway
the
flavors
alone
are
all
there
and
not
bad
at
all
its
easy
to
drink
but
it
would
take
a
true
banana
lover
to
reach
for
more
than
one
gimmicky
kept
running
through
my
mind
but
better
than
many
other
gimmicky
beers
fruity
or
not
that
are
out
there
this
beer
is
a
light
clear
beer
with
a
creamy
tan
head
when
you
open
the
bottle
the
smell
of
banana
candy
hits
you
my
wife
reminded
me
of
those
large
peanut
shaped
banana
flavored
soft
candies
we
had
as
kids
not
a
pleasant
odor
in
a
beer
in
my
opinion
i
dont
taste
much
of
a
bread
taste
i
found
the
smell
to
be
overpowering
the
finish
is
more
of
the
same
artificial
banana
the
liquor
store
in
nj
where
i
bought
it
was
bourbon
street
in
greenwich
the
manager
noticing
i
was
buying
2
cases
of
micros
recommended
it
and
assured
me
it
was
not
too
overpowering
i
wont
be
taking
his
advice
again
i
just
could
not
get
past
the
artificial
banana
taste
it
was
all
i
could
taste
before
during
and
after
i
rinsed
my
glass
before
going
back
to
drinking
real
beer
but
the
banana
taste
just
lingered
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
light
lacing
there
is
surprise
surprise
a
hint
of
banana
in
the
aroma
i
was
expecting
it
to
have
an
overpowering
banana
flavor
but
instead
it
was
very
subtle
at
first
i
was
kinda
let
down
in
the
same
manner
that
a
framboise
is
liquid
raspberry
i
wanted
this
to
be
liquid
banana
halfway
through
however
i
began
to
appreciate
the
subtle
hints
of
banana
and
nutmeg
the
finish
is
very
breadyyeasty
and
kinda
sweet
i
imagine
that
it
would
have
been
amazing
with
bananas
foster
or
some
type
of
similar
dessert
saw
this
one
in
rehoboth
beach
the
label
and
name
immediately
stood
out
to
me
and
i
just
had
to
grab
it
nice
large
19oz
bottle
it
smells
candyish
i
wouldnt
really
say
artificial
but
the
scent
reminds
me
of
banana
flavored
candy
like
a
now
later
the
taste
is
kind
of
odd
and
maybe
a
little
disappointing
hearing
the
name
you
would
think
hefeweizen
but
its
really
not
the
banana
flavor
isnt
really
all
that
pronounced
nothing
like
say
a
weinstephaner
and
it
quickly
vanishes
to
reveal
a
bland
almost
flat
lager
flavor
underneath
finishes
watery
and
forgettable
and
not
that
clean
on
a
positive
note
this
brewery
uses
its
own
well
water
for
brewing
and
fairtrade
bananas
are
used
in
the
brewing
process
drinkability
this
beer
actually
went
well
with
a
fresh
loaf
of
banana
bread
i
made
but
as
a
stand
alone
beer
it
is
interesting
and
different
but
not
one
you
would
drink
regularly
nice
novelty
beer
in
my
opinion
good
drinkability
as
its
actually
pretty
refreshing
a
novelty
beer
to
be
sure
but
its
honestly
not
bad
and
i
might
even
be
inclined
to
pick
up
another
bottle
if
i
ever
saw
it
again
i
think
this
would
be
great
to
have
on
a
fall
evening
as
it
sort
seems
to
be
in
the
same
vein
as
pumpkin
ales
to
me
in
the
end
a
good
brew
that
is
just
above
the
novelty
ring
md
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
ever
had
not
overpowering
not
underflavored
a
great
beer
if
you
can
get
this
definitely
try
it
if
i
found
this
in
a
pub
i
could
drink
it
all
night
its
a
sweet
beer
thats
not
overly
sweet
im
not
really
for
or
against
fruit
beers
i
just
appreciate
when
they
are
done
well
and
this
one
tastes
like
really
bananas
not
naturalartificial
banana
flavoring
not
bad
at
all
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
forming
a
1
inch
head
the
aroma
is
of
very
strong
banana
bread
nothing
else
is
detectible
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
banana
bread
flavor
along
with
light
spices
not
overpowering
but
noticeable
smooth
light
finish
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
it
tastes
just
what
it
says
it
is
no
suprises
there
good
flavor
and
average
abv
make
this
brew
a
sessionable
ale
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
drank
average
nothing
special
here
banana
freaks
may
like
this
was
looking
for
a
lot
more
breadyness
to
go
with
it
makes
me
wish
for
some
bombardier
on
cask
recommended
for
banana
freaks
and
those
wanting
to
get
a
bit
primal
bananas
boom
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
opened
banans
everywhere
poured
with
some
head
that
quickly
faded
to
almost
nothing
no
lace
has
a
deep
amber
tinged
with
red
hues
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
dry
with
some
bitterness
strong
banana
esters
medium
body
naturally
long
banana
finish
one
was
enough
overall
its
an
above
average
beer
that
with
a
few
minor
changes
could
become
really
good
if
they
would
add
a
little
more
banana
some
spice
and
kick
back
on
some
of
the
hops
this
one
could
truly
shine
without
these
changes
its
still
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
that
dares
to
be
different
wonderful
aroma
disappointing
taste
d
meh
not
really
worth
the
money
it
is
far
from
the
worst
thing
i
have
come
across
but
ill
be
better
off
not
having
it
again
when
i
want
banana
bread
beer
i
will
seek
out
aventinus
that
is
certainly
closer
in
flavor
though
not
in
ingredients
a
nice
beer
worth
trying
and
i
think
worth
repeating
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
ok
flavors
seems
to
fight
a
little
bit
pretty
much
all
about
the
bananas
i
actually
think
this
would
be
better
if
it
was
a
little
less
carbonated
as
well
as
a
little
toned
down
in
the
hop
department
overall
not
bad
though
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
but
cant
say
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
its
not
bad
its
just
bland
the
problem
is
its
called
banana
bread
beer
and
you
expect
some
banana
and
bread
flavors
i
didnt
get
any
of
that
it
was
just
sweet
and
smooth
without
anything
standing
out
came
off
like
an
average
amber
ale
d
a
great
ale
to
mix
or
compliment
chocolate
but
not
cloying
fruity
but
just
enough
to
fit
the
style
i
would
try
it
any
time
i
might
be
feeling
a
little
bananas
there
is
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
this
beer
however
i
think
if
it
had
any
more
then
it
may
make
the
pint
a
bit
sickly
however
as
it
is
it
is
very
drinkable
dont
simply
buy
one
bottle
of
this
pleasant
refreshing
fruit
beer
or
you
will
be
very
disappointed
overall
an
average
fruit
beer
if
they
dropped
the
hop
taste
and
aroma
and
allowed
the
focus
to
be
on
the
banana
i
think
this
could
be
a
much
more
interesting
offering
as
it
is
one
bottle
is
plenty
i
wont
be
buying
more
the
label
suggests
a
mediumbrown
ale
but
whats
actually
poured
is
clear
copper
with
insignificant
head
and
little
lace
smells
of
squishy
banana
pulp
and
little
else
flavor
is
weak
but
a
bit
better
than
the
smell
starts
with
thin
biscuit
malt
builds
juicy
banana
flavor
in
the
center
before
finishing
with
a
faint
touch
of
hop
dryness
watery
and
overlycarbonated
body
light
and
drinkable
if
not
very
interesting
drinkability
if
nothing
else
this
is
a
drinkable
ale
its
character
and
complexity
wont
send
you
back
for
a
case
but
as
long
as
youre
not
asking
this
to
be
a
dessert
beer
you
should
be
happy
the
taste
was
good
nice
banana
front
with
a
load
of
soft
malt
and
yeast
again
a
small
tint
of
metal
and
alcohol
taint
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
good
beer
to
sip
and
if
you
like
banana
try
this
beer
d
i
would
have
this
beer
again
but
it
might
not
be
my
first
could
have
more
of
a
banana
taste
i
guess
if
youre
a
banana
fan
this
is
probably
an
alright
beer
the
concept
seems
weird
to
me
though
and
i
was
unable
to
finish
a
whole
bottle
however
i
assume
thats
mainly
because
of
my
dislike
of
bananas
pretty
good
and
it
might
make
a
nice
inbetween
beer
when
youre
at
a
pub
and
looking
to
mix
things
up
not
great
but
not
bad
either
lightmedium
bodied
drinkable
but
a
little
more
body
would
add
to
the
experience
this
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
banana
bread
or
even
bananas
this
is
worth
a
try
probably
best
as
a
dessert
beer
but
could
work
with
pork
or
turkey
thanks
to
my
friend
steve
for
bringing
this
back
for
me
from
a
recent
trip
to
england
poured
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
and
appeared
a
dark
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
dense
head
smells
of
banana
taffy
and
sweet
caramel
tastes
of
sweet
bananas
malt
and
a
slight
bitter
citrus
lemony
tang
medium
bodied
and
finishes
dry
and
crisp
this
beer
delivers
on
its
label
and
i
would
certainly
seek
this
one
out
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
the
carbonation
is
disagreeable
the
long
lasting
mineral
water
flavor
also
detracts
from
my
enjoyment
the
beer
is
ok
to
drink
one
time
i
will
not
repeat
this
particular
beer
again
overall
the
label
states
it
plainly
this
beer
is
all
about
banana
bread
the
smell
is
wonderful
but
the
taste
feels
tamed
and
short
with
some
crisp
bitter
bite
at
the
end
crisp
and
bitter
does
not
belong
with
banana
and
bread
as
well
as
a
fairly
light
body
just
a
fun
novelty
beer
overall
d
would
like
it
to
be
thicker
on
the
tongue
and
creamier
on
the
finish
to
give
it
more
of
a
bready
texture
just
feel
its
annoyingly
thin
almost
dare
i
say
a
macro
with
a
banana
flavour
this
could
have
been
so
much
better
but
still
a
nice
change
d
very
pleasantly
surprising
beer
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
it
was
very
good
i
had
this
beer
on
my
wants
list
for
quite
a
while
and
was
thrilled
when
i
spotted
it
on
my
recent
trip
to
ohio
im
glad
that
i
didnt
give
in
to
the
impulse
to
buy
multiple
bottles
because
it
really
isnt
that
good
my
scores
are
somewhat
inflated
because
i
enjoy
the
fresh
banana
part
of
the
schizoid
flavor
profile
so
much
it
hurts
me
to
say
it
but
this
beer
misses
the
mark
some
bananalike
flavor
in
hefewiezens
and
other
beers
is
actually
pretty
good
and
one
of
my
favorite
smells
is
the
fresh
baked
bread
aroma
in
some
belgian
and
german
beers
but
this
was
awful
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
chrystal
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
strong
banana
nose
starts
as
a
maltyhop
mix
but
then
the
banana
flavor
kicks
in
a
strange
soapy
banana
aftertaste

clear

color
with
a

and
minimal

the
aroma
is
of
course
all
bananas
mediumbodied
and
the
banana
character
luckily
is
not
as
dominant
in
the
flavor
as
it
is
in
the
aroma
however
it
is
still
a
lot
of
banana
along
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
nuts
the
finish
is
fruity
and
nutty
i
was
nervous
trying
this
but
it
actually
turned
out
better
than
expected
i
still
wouldnt
make
it
a
regular
purchase
though
i
want
to
quote
my
so
if
you
want
to
get

sweets
then
it
might
be
ok

i
for
myself
wonder
if
banana
beers
is
some
kind
of
strange
english
tradition
pours
a
rich
amber
with
some
significant
carbonation
feeding
a
nice
frothy
head
with
some
little
bits
of
foam
left
down
the
glass
strong
aroma
of
freshly
baked
banana
bread
what
more
can
i
say
except
that
i
quite
like
freshly
baked
banana
bread
some
more
traditional
malt
flavour
in
the
initial
taste
followed
rapidly
by
a
nice
banana
flavour
on
the
swallow
which
develops
into
a
nice
bready
flavour
and
finally
to
a
gentle
hop
finish
quite
an
interesting

profile
beer
banana
bread
then
back
to
beer
well
balanced
with
both
the
bananas
and
the
malt
and
hops
coming
through
im
impressed
with
this
a
nice
mouthfeel
without
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
very
interesting
and
rather
drinkable
novelty
beer
i
wouldnt
exactly
make
a
session
of
it
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
then
seek
this
out
this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
coat
that
clung
to
the
glass
somewhat
the
smell
was
very
reminiscent
of
banana
bread
with
notes
of
light
malt
and
caramel
the
smell
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
the
taste
was
lightly
tangy
and
malty
with
mild
banana
fruitiness
overall
with
mild
hoppiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
there
was
a
lightly
lingering
aftertaste
that
was
lightly
tangy
banana
and
malt
with
a
bit
off
hops
this
beer
was
really
not
bad
if
you
like
banana
or
hefeweizens
you
will
probably
like
it
other
comments
when
you
see
a
beer
called
banana
bread
beer
you
immediately
scoff
at
it
because
of
its
marketing
ploy
but
then
youre
almost
forced
to
give
it
a
try
thats
what
happened
to
me
anyway
definitely
gimmicky
but
its
not
allout
crap
like
banana
chapeau
or
something
doesnt
taste
like
it
smells
the
aroma
is
hyperbanana
but
the
banananess
in
the
flavor
is
more
like
an
overly
estery
hefeweizen
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
considering
the
style
i
cannot
fault
it
aside
from
the
fact
that
3
or
4
would
be
quite
sickly
this
is
definitely
a
nonsession
beer
before
you
even
get
to
what
it
looks
like
you
get
a
big
whiff
of
bananas
it
definitely
makes
you
think
twice
if
you
really
want
to
drink
a
banana
beer
or
not
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
light
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
big
head
that
goes
away
quickly
no
real
lacing
down
the
glass
did
i
mention
the
aroma
of
bananas
it
also
smells
a
bit
bready
the
predominate
taste
is
bananas
go
figure
there
is
a
bit
of
a
crispness
in
the
background
along
with
a
light
maltiness
did
i
mention
the
banana
taste
it
isnt
going
away
it
really
isnt
overpowering
but
it
is
all
that
is
really
there
and
they
are
just
too
much
to
take
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
that
ill
have
another
a
strange
beer
i
think
sweetish
doughy
banana
flavour
which
yes
ends
up
tasting
like
banana
bread
but
the
palate
was
a
little
to
sweet
and
even
cloying
i
thought
it
was
pretty
hard
to
down
in
the
end
dont
know
if
this
beer
quite
worked
for
me
way
too
sweet
more
like
fruit
juice
i
like
this
more
than
i
should
i
did
not
enjoy
this
at
all
i
always
see
this
beer
but
never
actually
see
anybody
buy
it
and
now
i
know
why
way
too
sweet
maybe
someone
goin
from
wine
coolers
to
beer
might
enjoy
this
so
so
so
super
sweet
its
too
sweet
for
a
beer
its
beer
candy
hahaha
its
pretty
smooth
but
its
too
sweet
when
you
want
real
beer
so
it
might
be
good
for
a
beginner
or
to
convert
someone
to
trying
beer
if
they
like
sweet
drinks
and
liquor
i
enjoy
the
fruity
taste
and
the
strong
smell
great
in
the
summer
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
is
almost
juicelike
the
very
subtle
hint
of
honey
halps
take
some
of
the
tart
out
there
is
very
litfle
actual
beer
taste
this
should
be
a
big
winner
for
lovers
of
fruit
punch
fruity
and
deliciously
crispy
perfect
for
a
summer
day

all

are
the

delicious

leave

an

it

overall
from
what
i
have
tasted
this
is
pretty
much
a
wine
cooler
if
you
want
something
very
sweet
and
lower
in
alcohol
this
may
be
it
but
if
looking
for
something
that
tastes
anything
like
a
beer
then
you
may
want
to
stay
away
overall
drinkability
i
got
this
an
extra
at
a
beer
tasting
when
this
particular
beer
is
mixed
with
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
it
is
a
very
nice
combo
by
itself
i
can
see
why
others
in
the
room
thought
this
was
a
wine
cooler
fruity
and
the
beer
gets
lost
in
it
all
i
finished
this
bottle
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
for
another
although
ill
give
it
a
slight
increase
in
rating
due
to
it
being
refreshing
which
i
suppose
is
the
whole
point
behind
a
shandy
or
radler
during
the
summer
that
fruit
serves
as
a
pickmeup
when
its
hot
out
and
you
want
something
to
drink
but
not
to
get
drunk
this
works
on
the
grounds
of
slaking
thirst
and
its
not
awful
but
its
awfully
sweet
and
once
done
im
good
and
have
no
interest
in
another
i
remember
drinking
this
in
college
thinking
it
would
be
an
upgrade
to
the
cheap
crap
i
was
drinking
at
the
time
boy
was
i
wrong
if
you
like
the
taste
of
fruity
pebbles
this
is
the
beer
for
you
otherwise
i
would
steer
clear
of
this
one
from
leineys
as
they
have
many
other
better
options
yeah
this
really
isnt
my
thing
glad
that
i
tried
it
just
so
i
know
to
steer
absolutely
clear
of
it
next
time
its
like
a
poor
mans
version
of
the
soft
parade
by
shorts
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
leinenkugels

a
nice
beer
from
a
good
brewer
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
this
got
to
hit
every
style
though
i
suppose
it
was
there
so
why
not
if
youre
a
beer
fan
you
wont
like
it
most
likely
overall
the
first
drink
or
two
is
ok
but
even
after
that
tasting
i
can
already
feel
myself
growing
distant
from
the
beer
ive
heard
of
people
mixing
this
beer
half
and
half
with
other
beers
and
i
can
understand
why
its
simply
overwhelming
if
leinenkugels
could
cut
the
taste
in
half
i
would
be
much
more
satisfied
overall
this
beer
is
not
very
complex
but
will
work
on
a
really
hot
day
or
for
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
this
is
a
mediocre
simple
fruit
beer
if
you
like
blackberries
and
a
light
bodied
beer
then
this
is
a
decent
offering
if
youre
looking
for
something
complex
or
full
bodied
look
elsewhere
definitely
not
my
style
of
beer
but
leinys
knows
its
fruit
beers
it
is
what
it
says
a
light
wheat
beer
with
tons
of
berries
from
the
northwoods
of
wisconsin
a
step
above
a
wine
cooler
i
guess
a
really
nice
light
fruity
beer
nothing
too
bad
but
also
nothing
absolutely
fantastic
i
picked
up
a
six
for
those
times
when
i
just
wanted
something
light
and
this
definitely
fits
the
bill
i
didnt
pour
it
out
so
no
comment
on
the
head
or
the
over
all
colour
the
taste
had
just
enough
beer
to
it
to
let
me
know
it
was
a
beer
and
not
a
wine
cooler
honestly
i
think
this
is
a
beer
that
a
lot
of
people
who
normally
wouldnt
like
could
come
to
enjoy
will
i
get
another
six
sure
now
that
my
girlfriend
likes
it
and
shes
busting
into
some
of
my
other
exotic
craft
beers
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
dark
pink
with
a

and
a
half
worth
of
head
interesting
to
say
the
least
it
smells
exactly
like
a
strawberry
milkshake
and
is
very
appealing
to
anybody
even
my
girlfriend
who
typically
doesnt
enjoy
any
type
of
beer
the
taste
is
of
cherry
7up
and
thats
about
it
not
bad
but
not
really
that
great
while
leaving
it
in
the
mouth
no
additional
flavors
come
through
it
only
feels
like
sparkling
wine
upon
your
tongue
once
again
interesting
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
however
not
something
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
in
europe
aften
called
a
girl
beer
lots
of
guys
drink
it
too
refreshing
beer
that
is
anything
but
a
traditional
beer
for
that
yes
its
way
too
sweet
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tried
it
is
not
even
worthy
of
a
pour
into
any
of
my
glassware
lest
the
super
sweet
artificial
flavors
may
forever
taint
my
glassware
i
would
rather
drink
any
other
beer
before
this
atrocity
the
only
way
i
was
able
to
finish
half
the
bottlewich
was
left
at
my
house
after
a
cookout
was
to
pretend
it
was
a
wine
cooler
wich
its
taste
more
resembles
do
not
buy
do
not
drink
for
free
overall
alcoholic
fruit
juice
period
mikes
hard
fruit
juice
basically
this
stuff
is
absolute
garbage
each
sip
i
took
to
write
this
review
was
painful
and
i
cant
wait
til
im
done
to
pour
this
down
the
drain
what
these
brewers
have
to
realize
is
that
with
fruity
beers
less
is
more
its
all
about
the
balance
if
you
want
to
try
a
good
example
of
this
style
pick
up
some
founders
cerise
great
in
bottles
even
better
in
a
frosty
can
or
mug
love
it
o
half
way
through
this
beer
i
almost
forgot
it
was
an
actual
beer
if
you
like
juice
drinks
then
this
is
for
you
i
might
consider
buying
this
for
my
girlfriend
who
is
into
mikes
hard
lemonade
and
all
that
other
fruity
stuff
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
depends
on
what
you
like
mouthfeel
is
average
overall
too
sweet
and
the
fruity
flavor
makes
it
taste
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
beer
not
horrible
to
drink
but
not
very
beer
like
either
pretty
amazing
pink
tinted
hue
going
on
head
was
white
with
addition
of
berry
juice
and
flavors
its
pretty
much
a
light
cotton
candy
pink
frothing
thick
head
aroma
has
tart
vinous
berries
with
an
upfront
acidic
quality
with
raspberrystrawberry
juice
notes
flavor
is
a
mix
of
juicy
fruit
tart
berries
earthy
citrus
flavor
its
actually
well
blended
i
thought
i
would
have
hated
it
but
its
actually
like
a
decent
alcopop
at
least
flavorwise
great
tasting
by
beverage
definition
theyre
onto
something
here
this
will
sell
mouthfeel
effervescent
carbonation
is
sturdy
i
actually
enjoyed
the
beer
its
filled
with
flavor
and
berry
notes
lighter
bodied
in
beer
standards
slightly
dry
acidity
nothing
like
a
belgian
fruit
ale
but
damn
good
drinking
fruit
beer
that
i
generally
despise
even
when
made
by
microbrewers
overall
im
not
into
these
types
of
beer
but
i
like
this
one
go
ahead
try
it
you
may
actually
enjoy
it
overall
although
very
sweet
it
was
a
rather
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
but
basically
it
dose
not
resemble
any
type
of
brew
i
have
had
so
far
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glassit
has
no
head
and
the
body
is
a
blush
color
body
the
smell
is
fruity
and
berry
the
taste
is
berry
sweet
and
fruity
not
a
normal
beer
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
it
is
almost
like
arbor
mist
overall
this
is
a
ok
beer
12
ounce
bottle
theres
a
date
of
sep
26
11
printed
on
it
but
i
have
no
idea
if
thats
the
bottled
on
or
best
by
date
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
pinkishamber
color
with
a
half
inch
light
pink
head
the
head
goes
away
quickly
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
berry
fruit
juicedrinks
and
grain
for
the
most
part
it
tastes
like
it
smells
it
tastes
like
a
mix
of
fruit
juice
grainy
malt
and
berry
flavored
carbonated
water
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
artificial
tasting
as
i
was
expecting
so
thats
a
plus
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
a
little
bit
syrupy
and
is
well
carbonated
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
id
have
to
say
this
is
average
all
around
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
i
dont
think
id
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
but
if
someone
gave
me
a
bottle
a
friend
did
give
me
this
one
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
the
taste
was
everything
youd
think
like
a
carbonated
koolaid
mix
definetly
not
what
a
ber
should
ever
taste
like
in
a
way
i
enjoyed
the
carbonation
its
basicly
the
only
thing
i
did
enjoy
everyone
has
theyre
own
taste
in
beer
but
this
wasnt
mine
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
easy
drinking
light
and
would
probably
be
nice
on
a
real
hot
day
unfortunately
though
i
just
didnt
think
it
was
a
very
good
beer
it
was
very
sweet
and
sugary
like
a
fruit
punch
and
the
fruity
flavors
felt
very
extracty
to
me
would
be
a
good
beer
to
give
to
nonbeer
lovers
though
so
im
sure
it
has
its
place
and
fans
a
very
interesting
brew
pours
a
fruity
purplish
pinkish
infused
hazy
gold
color
with
a
small
bubbly
head
smells
like
preserved
fruit
sugary
jams
and
wheat
taste
is
better
than
i
thought
itd
be
sweet
like
white
sugar
like
a
spoonful
of
smuckers
jelly
with
a
pleasant
yeasty
finish
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
quenching
summery
drinkable
more
than
a
couple
of
these
might
rot
your
teeth
though
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
summer
day
ive
been
known
to
squeeze
a
little
lime
in
my
corona
or
tecate
once
or
twice
i
have
even
garnished
a
hefeweizen
with
a
lemon
slice
but
thats
about
where
it
ends
i
like
tuna
i
like
martinis
but
i
wouldnt
mix
up
a
batch
of
tunatinis
i
guess
im
just
a
fan
of
beer
flavored
beer
overall
drinkability
decent
fruit
beer
the
berry
weiss
beer
is
a
good
fruitveggie
beer
the
berries
obviously
dominate
the
smell
and
taste
the
color
was
nice
with
decent
white
head
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
a
light
great
for
summertime
libations
although
to
sweet
for
me
and
i
would
not
drink
alot
of
this
stuff
really
no
redeeming
quality
to
this
beer
other
than
the
fact
its
not
absolutely
terrible
it
just
kinda
sucks
o
the
sugarysweetness
keeps
this
beer
from
being
very
drinkable
i
was
happy
enough
to
try
it
but
certainly
did
not
want
another
one
i
can
see
why
some
people
might
like
this
beer
though
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
great
on
a
warm
summer
night
or
anytime
during
the
summer
i
work
parttime
at
a
beer
distributor
and
have
recommended
this
beer
to
customers
and
it
seems
to
sell
ok
when
we
have
it
in
stock
my
friends
also
seem
to
enjoy
it
too
i
know
there
will
probably
always
be
a
market
out
there
for
this
stuff
but
i
dont
know
why
not
a
jacob
leinenkugel
best
probably
their
worst
imho
m
like
a
soda
in
every
way
thin
and
watery
o
not
a
beer
i
normally
would
reach
for
but
it
was
a
refreshing
choice
for
a
4th
of
july
picnic
where
the
weather
was
hazy
hot
and
humid
waaay
sweeter
than
i
expected
leaves
a
syrupy
fruity
residue
on
the
lips
beery
aspects
of
this
beverage
are
almost
completely
lost
to
artificialtasting
sweet
fruit
juice
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
fruit
beers
but
this
is
difficult
for
me
to
finish
i
dont
know
if
a
fresher
sample
would
help
but
i
cant
help
but
think
the
sweet
artificial
berry
flavor
would
still
be
overwhelming
as
much
as
i
hate
the
malt
beverage
cliche
pantydropper
that
is
what
came
to
mind
right
off
the
bat
for
this
atrocity
this
offering
was
much
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
i
would
not
want
to
try
it
again
o
nothing
about
this
is
remotely
complex
and
reminds
me
more
of
a
malt
cooler
than
a
beer
that
being
said
it
is
darn
tasty
and
i
could
probably
knock
back
a
sixpack
without
thinking
twice
o
im
not
opposed
to
fruit
beers
this
just
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
i
mean
give
me
a
good
framboise
or
a
kriek
any
day
of
the
week
overall
not
a
great
exemplar
of
the
style
be
a
fruit
beer
or
be
a
weizen
cant
do
both
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
experience
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
im
a
crazy
hophead
with
a
sweet
tooth
too
so
this
is
a
nice
wat
to
mix
things
up
especially
in
the
warmer
months
im
a
girl
and
what
can
i
say
i
like
fruity
drinks
from
time
to
time
but
i
also
enjoy
an
ice
cold
beer
as
well
this
brew
offers
me
a
little
bit
of
both
the
smooth
berry
brew
has
come
to
be
one
of
my
personal
favorites
and
i
would
recommend
you
give
this
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
little
something
that
the
typical
hops
and
barley
combo
doesnt
offer
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
purplish
pink
color
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
the
smell
is
of
sweet
berries
and
some
wheat
in
the
back
the
taste
is
basically
a
wine
cooler
very
sweet
berries
up
front
that
fades
into
a
light
wheat
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
highly
carbonated
its
ok
if
you
like
really
sweet
stuff
ill
drink
it
if
its
around
for
free
but
that
about
all
direct
from
the
leinie
lodge
to
my
glass
the
crack
glug
produced
two
fingers
of
cotton
candy
i
mean
cotton
candylike
pink
head
with
good
retention
for
you
jaspers
that
wonder
why
it
is
so
important
to
decant
from
can
to
a
glass
the
visuals
on
this
one
would
be
your
answer
pink
beer
like
pink
lemonade
including
a
slight
haze
i
am
cuing
up
the
theme
to
pink
panther
rather
like
champagne
with
the
flavoring
of
berries
and
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
it
lacked
an
after
taste
and
had
very
little
hoppy
flavor
this
was
a
very
good
beer
from
leinenkugel
and
i
will
be
very
happy
to
buy
it
again

off
this

is
what
it
is
a
fruit
beer
for
mass
consumption
and
for
those
who
arent
going
to

a

to
experience
good

combinations
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
during
the
warmer

the
color
is
that
of

the
taste
is
predominantly
blackberry
with

know
this
particular
beer
is
very
polarized
in
its
reviews
overall
blueberry

raspberry
taste
is
the
same
except
that
there
is
a
dominant
honey
aftertaste
this
is
different
than
any

have
ever
had

in

im

searching
this

out
i
actually
like
fruit
beers
and
another
wisconsin
brewery
new
glarus
offers
two
such
beers
that
are
also
quite
sweet
but
are
far
superior
the
difference
is
that
those
beers
combine
fruit
and
grain
in
a
seamless
way
whereas
this
tastes
like
a

never
a

again
if

this

i
wont

to

it
i
like
fruit
beer
there
was
more
substance
than
just
the
fruit
it
had
a
great
smell
for
obvious
reasons
and
although
it
lingers
a

in

its

511the
body
was
light
a
tad
watery
and
limited
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
fine
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
someone
offered
me
one
i
just
wouldnt
go
around
calling
it
a
beer
overall
an
excellent
beer
quite
refreshing
compared
to
most
beers
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
is
categorized
correctly
as
a
fruit
vegetable
beer
it
is
bold
and
overdone
with
the
berries
nothing
subtle
about
this
drinkability
is
average
at
best
because
of
the
sweetness
mixed
with
honey
weiss
it
is
much
better
if
they
tweaked
the
recipe
it
might
be
better
a
good
one
for
your
girlfriend
who
doesnt
like
beer
not
the
worst
thing
ever
made
but
not
one
i
drink
unless
the
wife
buys
her
sixpack
of
it
for
the
year
and
lets
bottles
sit
around
in
the
fridge
for
too
long
i
should
hate
this
but
i
dont
probably
the
best
in
class
for
what
it
is
and
i
dont
mean
best
fruit
beer
if
i
was
out
in
minneapolis
and
it
was
this
or
a
macro
id
drink
it
cloudy
reddish
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
is
all
berries
but
i
cant
really
tell
what
berries
are
used
maybe
blackberries
taste
has
more
of
that
sweet
berry
juice
flavor
fine
at
first
sip
sick
by
the
time
im
midway
through
i
like
a
sweeter
beer
from
time
to
time
but
this
one
needs
more
complexity
and
something
to
couterbalance
the
berries
plus
the
berry
flavor
isnt
really
all
that
good
tastes
a
little
fake
not
a
terrible
beer
and
maybe
refreshing
after
a
workout
in
the
hot
summer
heat
but
so
is
kool
aid
beer
poured
a
nice
colored
red
definately
not
a
traditional
beer
color
but
nice
looking
anyway
nice
head
on
it
but
didnt
stay
around
long
the
aroma
was
a
wonderful
berry
aroma
without
a
hint
of
any
real
beer
aromas
taste
is
almost
sickeningly
sweet
almost
like
a
soda
flavor
of
berry
concentrate
overpowers
all
other
flavors
especially
the
wonderful
flavors
of
a
traditional
weiss
definately
not
a
food
beer
as
every
food
i
ate
with
this
beer
made
it
taste
nasty
the
name
is
german
for
white
berry
hm
are
there
any
white
berries
perhaps
they
are
trying
to
tell
us
it
is
a
weiss
type
beer
flavored
with
berries
the
appearance
is
weird

kind
of
a
salmoncoral
color
a
nice
size
foamy
head
that
disappears
without
a
trace
aroma
is
also
weird
like
a
floral
rhine
wine
aroma
smells
like
a
coaltar
derivative
berry
extract
no
hops
no
malt
no
cigar
initial
taste
is
somewhat
malty
but
that
is
overwhelmed
by
the
honeysweet
berry
flavoring
a
thin
watery
beer
that
leaves
a
nasty
taste
in
your
mouth
eek
poured
a
light
reddish
berry
color
with
very
little
head
it
smelled
like
a
wine
cooler
mixed
with
a
coors
light
but
to
if
i
had
to
describe
the
taste
i
would
say
it
smelled
of
berrys
and
with
a
hint
of
malt
it
tasted
like
a
mix
of
strong
berry
concentrate
with
a
slight
node
of
hop
overall
this
beer
was
ok
but
nothing
i
would
run
out
and
grab
again
best
off
the
fresh
pour
while
the
carbonation
is
still
active
if
it
sits
or
warms
cant
do
it
drink
cold
while
your
hot
it
goes
down
fast
with
a
nice
little
kick
to
it
this
beer
reminded
me
very
much
of
btothee
in
taste
smell
and
appearance
pinkish
purple
color
smells
of
grain
and
berry
flavoring
taste
is
actually
quite
unpleasent
sweet
but
has
an
odd
funkiness
about
it
from
the
malt
not
very
good
i
like
btothee
better
than
this
but
not
by
much
it
was
the
first
beer
id
seen
which
was
a
purplish
color
it
smelled
nice
but
nothing
to
great
the
taste
is
good
but
has
no
real
beer
flavor
to
it
it
is
very
drinkable
with
the
sweet
taste
however
it
does
not
taste
much
like
beer
as
a
college
student
i
would
recommend
this
to
the
coeds
but
not
so
much
for
any
true
beer
fans
this
is
exhibit
no
1
on
the
list
of
outofbalance
fruit
beers
to
clarify
i
like
it
and
in
the
right
situation
would
drink
it
the
low
grades
simply
reflect
that
leines
berry
weiss
just
isnt
much
of
a
beer
and
doesnt
for
the
most
part
meet
the
minimal
standard
requirements
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
berry
flavored
malternative
went
down
well
with
strawberry
shortcake
a
little
more
tart
than
typical
wine
coolers
but
along
the
same
lines
pours
the
color
of
red
grapefruit
with
a
thin
pinkish
head
smells
very
sweet
grapes
and
raspberries
it
goes
quickly
down
hill
from
there
tastes
like
sugary
sweet
fruity
koolaid
with
a
bit
of
toasted
wheat
that
is
the
only
remotely
redeeming
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
syrupy
leinies
is
usually
reliably
mediocre
and
i
can
rely
on
them
when
faced
with
bad
beer
choices
but
this
one
didnt
sit
well
with
me
at
all
this
one
pours
a
dark
pink
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
behind
much
lacing
pretty
very
sweet
aroma
of
raspberries
but
not
tart
at
all
the
malts
and
hops
dont
come
through
well
because
of
the
strenght
of
the
fruit
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
lots
of
sweet
raspberry
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
beer
in
the
back
good
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
its
just
not
very
beerlike
for
the
malternative
crowd
this
is
probably
good
ive
got
a
buddy
who
is
hopelessly
addicted
to
sweet
ciders
as
well
and
he
loves
this
stuff
i
personally
dont
care
for
the
sweeter
beers
and
this
definitelly
falls
into
that
category
at
least
once
a
summer
i
find
myself
picking
this
beer
up
the
beer
pours
a
dark
purple
that
leads
to
an
impressive
head
i
can
smell
berries
raspberry
maybe
blueberry
and
cannot
detect
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
different
i
have
thought
the
leinies
carbonates
their
beers
a
little
too
much
that
leads
to
beer
gut
this
beer
is
no
exception
often
times
the
carbonation
overcomes
the
beer
that
aside
the
beers
tastes
of
a
berry
flavored
malt
some
say
this
is
a
wine
cooler
but
i
disagree
in
my
opinion
the
beer
is
a
little
thicker
than
that
beer
tastes
better
cold
and
due
to
the
carbonation
it
is
not
very
drinkable
not
a
session
beer
by
no
means
however
one
should
try
this
at
least
once
a
year
when
it
is
season
ill
admit
limited
knowlege
on
fruit
beer
style
but
i
feel
this
beer
was
just
to
sweet
i
feel
they
couldve
done
better
evening
out
the
berries
and
the
hop
and
malt
taste
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
medium
pink
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
just
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
very
fruity
lots
of
raspberry
very
sweet
almost
smells
like
lindemans
framboise
the
taste
starts
out
good
with
a
lot
of
sweet
berries
up
front
the
finish
is
wheaty
and
somewhat
phenolic
a
little
offputting
the
body
is
a
little
light
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
just
fair
as
well
mostly
due
to
the
taste
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
drink
but
as
a
beer
goes
it
is
not
exactly
a
stellar
offering
the
beer
pours
a
pinkish
color
just
sort
of
unnatural
for
beer
i
could
handle
it
if
this
were
brewed
with
the
berry
juice
but
it
is
just
flavored
with
it
there
is
not
much
coming
through
in
the
nose
but
the
berry
sweetness
i
get
blackberries
and
raspberries
from
the
smell
i
like
a
nice
berry
wheat
beer
if
the
berry
is
involved
in
the
fermentation
tasting
the
drink
the
berry
sweetness
kick
you
hard
first
after
swallowing
there
is
a
hint
that
you
are
drinking
a
beer
but
it
is
just
an
afterthought
i
have
to
give
this
a
bit
of
a
kick
on
the
drinkability
as
i
have
been
known
to
kill
a
6
of
this
in
a
night
but
because
it
is
flavored
with
juice
it
cant
be
more
than
slightly
above
average
this
beer
of
a
winecooler
actually
started
out
nice
enough
but
ive
quickly
found
that
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
its
so
sickly
sweet
actually
this
would
probably
go
really
well
mixed
6040
with
a
really
good
ipa
or
hearty
stout
so
as
to
offset
the
sweetness
with
some
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
im
not
going
to
say
that
every
beer
drinker
is
going
to
like
berry
weis
though
i
do
think
that
every
beer
drinker
should
try
it
its
truly
in
a
class
by
itself
pours
a
cloudy
pinkpeach
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
which
disappeared
quickly
there
was
no
lace
on
the
glass
at
all
this
kind
of
looks
to
be
the
color
of
a
raspberry
lambic
only
a
shade
or
two
lighter
the
smell
is
of
sweet
berries
blackberries
peaches
maybe
some
raspberry
the
taste
is
very
very
sweet
a
great
amount
of
blackberry
flavor
with
no
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
at
all
it
even
seemed
a
little
winey
towards
the
end
very
smooth
with
no
real
peaks
of
flavor
very
light
body
and
highly
carbonated
and
fuzzy
this
seems
right
for
this
type
of
beer
overall
didnt
seem
like
a
weiss
beer
at
all
too
sweet
for
me
but
not
horrible
poured
a
cloudy
purplishpink
color
with
a
large
foamy
pink
head
the
head
quickly
dissipated
to
a
bubbly
pink
film
no
mistaking
the
scent
thats
definitely
berry
taste
is
initially
like
a
berry
wine
cooler
but
not
quite
as
sweet
and
followed
by
a
slight
taste
of
wheat
and
malt
just
barely
enough
to
call
this
a
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
pretty
well
carbonated
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
however
this
really
isnt
as
horrible
as
some
of
the
other
reviews
make
it
out
to
be
berry
weiss
reminds
me
of
that
classic
cheers
episode
in
which
norm
talks
about
eating
at
a
restaurant
that
serves
artificial
meat
he
specifically
mentions
bef
and
loobster
as
two
of
his
favorites
maybe
this
stuff
should
be
called
ber
or
bere
since
it
doesnt
much
resemble
beer
bad
yet
i
keep
seeing
this
every
summer
so
someone
is
drinking
it
or
buying
it
to
try
saying
eek
and
dumping
this
is
truly
a
hideous
beer
the
berry
is
cloying
and
artificial
the
honey
is
sweet
and
the
appearance
is
a
downright
frightening
and
unatural
pink
the
taste
has
kind
of
puckering
that
reminds
me
a
little
of
the
mouthfeel
of
a
wheat
but
it
lacks
all
other
charecteristics
of
a
wheat
my
mothernlaw
loves
them
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
to
me
i
suppose
it
might
be
a
good
crossover
beer
but
it
is
a
long
long
journey
from
this
beer
to
anything
respectable
another
one
of
my
least
favorite
beer
styles
this
one
was
too
berry
and
way
too
sweet
tasting
for
me
it
had
a
small
white
creamy
head
with
fine
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
cloudy
with
carbonation
observed
and
the
hue
was
berry
the
nose
was
heavily
berry
and
the
taste
was
very
sweet
tart
sour
and
tangy
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
with
a
thinwatery
texture
and
light
bodied
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
this
beer
on
a
second
tasting
i
had
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
to
avoid
the
disturbing
blue
color
even
then
you
get
a
vaguely
trixflavored
mess
simply
ghastly
poured
a
creepy
pinkish
color
the
bottle
noted
blackberrys
used
in
the
brewing
but
the
aroma
was
more
raspberry
candy
cloyingly
sweet
berry
flavor
if
there
is
beer
beneath
this
onslaught
of
berry
syrup
i
cant
find
it
this
is
more
like
some
malternative
berry
cooler
than
beer
i
toughed
it
out
through
half
the
bottle
and
decided
life
is
to
short
to
struggle
on
with
finishing
the
beer
candy
poured
pink
and
light
like
lemonade
not
beer
very
strange
head
that
left
a
high
honey
and
berry
smell
i
liked
the
smell
becuase
i
like
fruity
smells
in
my
home
unfortunately
i
dont
like
them
in
my
beer
i
didnt
taste
beer
in
this
beverage
i
tasted
far
too
much
candy
like
sweetness
i
may
have
to
use
this
for
a
marinade
sometime
but
well
see
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
left
the
berry
taste
for
too
long
i
can
drink
this
again
but
if
im
offered
something
else
id
probably
leave
it
for
the
teenagers
to
drink
not
that
i
condone
that
behavior
it
say
on
the
bottle
it
is
brewed
by
73
people
who
care
i
dont
know
what
they
care
about
because
it
sure
isnt
the
taste
of
this
stuff
tastes
like
shook
up
boones
farm
poured
into
a
dirty
coffee
cup
looks
like
pink
lemonade
beer
shouldnt
look
like
that
if
you
like
zima
but
feel
it
isnt
sweet
enough
for
you
give
this
stuff
a
try
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
it
aint
beer
color
is
orangy
lightish
yellow
trying
to
be
red
but
thinning
fluffy
loose
head
thats
light
greyish
pink
fades
and
fizzes
away
pretty
fast
leaves
soapy
drippy
lace
smell
is
light
of
strawberry
and
raspberry
with
a
wheaty
touch
and
sharp
tint
of
clean
floral
hops
noted
underneath
taste
is
a
weaker
version
of
any
decent
fruit
beer
light
crisp
lightly
flavored
of
raspberry
and
strawbeery
i
guess
its
hard
to
determine
cuz
its
a
little
much
and
unmixed
very
juice
like
but
watered
down
quite
a
bit
feel
is
lightly
creamy
but
watery
and
a
thin
finish
its
a
fine
summer
drink
but
more
then
one
of
these
and
it
could
get
tiresome
give
me
a
good
hefe
instead
pours
out
a
pink
lemonade
colour
with
a
big
pink
foamy
head
which
leave
rings
of
lace
never
seen
a
beer
of
this
shade
before
big
time
berry
aromas
hard
to
pick
out
any
weiss
characteristics
previous
reviewers
who
hinted
at
the
fact
this
could
be
confused
with
a
wine
cooler
or
other
malt
beverage
have
it
nailed
too
sweet
and
full
of
wild
berries
while
not
undrinkable
in
its
own
right
for
a
beer
this
is
gone
wild
i
cant
imagine
drinking
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
its
just
too
much
now
i
could
see
mixing
this
with
the
honey
weiss
in
the
middle
of
summer
floating
down
the
apple
river
in
somerset
wisconsin
with
many
bikini
clad
home
grown
minnesota
and
wisconsin
babes
sharing
in
the
sweet
nectar
um
thats
beside
the
point
and
this
is
not
really
a
beer
try
something
else
a
variation
is
a
honey
berry
half
leinies
berry
weiss
and
half
honey
weiss
the
combination
cuts
some
of
the
sweetsness
in
the
berry
weiss
alone
and
makes
the
drink
a
little
bit
more
tolerable
i
tried
one
for
the
first
time
years
ago
at
a
concert
at
alpine
valley
where
they
had
a
leinie
lodge
set
up
and
were
pouring
pitchers
for
those
who
were
interested
what
can
i
say
except
that
this
reminds
me
of
a
wine
cooler
or
something
along
those
lines
luckily
i
was
given
one
of
these
and
didnt
make
the
mistake
of
buying
a
whole
sixer
some
artificial
berry
flavors
mixed
into
a
standard
beer
skip
this
poser
still
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
a
refreshing
libation
on
a
hot
day
or
with
a
sweet
dessert
for
that
matter
this
is
an
amber
beer
that
exhibits
a
pink
tint
it
pours
with
a
creamy
head
and
displays
good
retention
the
aroma
is
similar
to
a
wine
cooler
heavy
on
the
berries
with
maybe
a
touch
of
malt
the
flavor
is
also
wine
coolerish
heavy
on
the
berries
as
well
the
finish
is
a
little
too
sweet
but
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
it
was
a
nice
experience
berry
juice
colored
minimal
head
fruity
sort
of
very
berry
hiclike
aroma
not
much
beer
flavor
to
balance
the
fruit
flavor
is
all
fruit
juice
the
slightest
hint
of
wheat
flavor
is
present
mouthfell
is
thin
with
effervescent
carbonation
not
bad
if
your
into
fruit
beers
also
may
be
a
good
cross
over
beer
for
some
macro
drinkers
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
berry
weiss
excursion
look
no
further
if
lacking
in
anything
it
seems
to
be
the
alcohol
content
that
could
be
more
for
my
taste
i
wouldnt
drink
this
allofthetime
but
it
is
a
nice
changeofpace
beer
a
side
note
last
summer
at
my
sisters
gift
opening
party
at
my
mom
and
dads
house
the
sunday
after
her
wedding
there
were
coolers
macrobrews
available
among
others
leineys
honey
and
berry
were
available
zap
and
i
hid
in
the
garage
with
the
coolers
during
the
actual
gift
opening
we
discovered
a
half
and
half
mix
of
berry
and
honey
actually
tasted
halfway
decent
it
went
down
pretty
easy
on
a
day
we
both
were
experiencing
minor
hang
overs
i
dont
like
this
one
its
got
a
great
smell
looks
well
the
problem
is
its
too
fruity
not
beery
enough
when
you
buy
their
mixedcase
leave
this
ones
for
the
youngins
or
the
wimmins
and
i
am
from
wis
so
i
should
be
biased
but
as
a
local
let
me
tell
you
to
stay
the
hell
away
from
this
sweetberry
disaster
in
my
opinion
way
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
a
fruit
beer
in
that
theres
no
trace
of
balance
for
the
sweetness
and
little
mouthfeel
to
balance
the
overcarbed
fizziness
can
be
refreshing
on
first
impression
but
the
over
sweet
and
bubbly
taste
and
cloying
swallow
annoy
me
more
with
every
sip
not
recommended
tasted
like
pledge
smells
this
beer
is
horrible
perfect
break
from
ipas
a
refreshing
alternative
to
malt
lemonade
definitely
summer
in
a
bottle
smooth
light
refreshing
lemon
with
great
taste
o
its
okay
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
great
for
guzzling
on
a
hot
day
though
had
this
beer
at
a
company
party
it
was
surprisingly
tasty
strong
lemon
notes
but
it
was
smooth
almost
malty
overall
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
delicious
perfect
summertime
awesome
beer
good
refreshing
summer
beer
not
a
purists
beer
great
for
a
summer
outing
when
a
porter
or
stout
would
be
too
heavy
purchased
at
total
wine
summer
2012
nice
midday
hot
summer
beverage
great
during
a
hot
summer
day
but
can
only
drink
a
few
before
they
become
to
sweet
i
dont
like
this
one
too
much
its
a
weird
weissbier
with
some
sort
of
lemonade
flavoring
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
is
has
alcohol
first
summer
beer
i
had
and
loved
it
i
do
not
write
reviews
nice
summertime
beer
with
a
slice
of
orange
great
summer
beer
for
cookouts
or
the
beach
mow
the
lawn
and
then
partake
in
one
of
these
best
they
will
ever
taste
sweet
lemony
taste
great
on
the
golf
course
or
a
patio
on
a
hot
day
leinenliugels
honey
weiss
this
wasnt
as
bad
you
could
taste
the
honey
in
it
it
wasnt
a
particular
strong
wheat
beer
or
that
memorable
seeing
how
i
just
drank
it
and
nothing
really
stands
out
awesome
summer
brew
take
a
case
to
the
beach
or
a
bbq
and
party
great
summer
beer
not
a
dan
of
sweet
fruit
beers
but
this
has
more
tangy
lemon
flavors
rather
than
sweet
candy
flavors
this
beer
has
a
prominent
lemonade
taste
it
is
tailormade
for
a
summers
day
fine
beer
for
some
people
but
not
for
me
looks
light
and
like
lemonade
but
nothing
better
in
the
summer
tried
to
figure
out
if
i
was
drinking
lemon
pledge
or
carbonated
lemonade
with
a
strong
alcohol
feel
got
the
lemon
perfect
so
refreshing
cant
keep
enough
around
for
wife
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
eve
also
a
good
beer
to
cook
with
packers
suck
not
a
shandy
fan
but
i
try
them
try
any
beer
once
a
great
summer
beer
highly
recommend
overall
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
beer
it
definitely
will
grow
on
you
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
las
vegas
i
saw
it
on
the
menu
and
had
to
try
it
it
was
very
refreshing
and
i
ordered
a
second
bottle
goes
well
with
any
summer
foods
like
bbq
chicken
not
an
everyday
kinda
beer
but
an
enjoyable
tongue
twister
you
should
sample
when
you
get
a
chance
absolutely
one
of
my
favorites
awesome
summer
beer
very
smooth
on
a
tender
pallet
refreshing
and
perfect
for
warm
weather
overall
it
was
a
mediocre
drink
with
faint
grainy
wheat
taste
nothing
but
lemons
lemons
and
lemons
im
not
drinking
this
again
too
cloudy
strong
lemon
tastes
more
like
candy
than
beer
good
summer
beer
but
not
for
the
hardcore
beer
enthusiast
good
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
when
you
dont
want
to
feel
full
i
think
all
of
leinenkugels
fruit
beers
are
the
same
fruity
and
delicious
but
leave
you
wishing
they
had
something
more
distinguishing
than
which
fruit
is
in
this
particular
beer
youre
drinking
at
that
moment
refreshing
beverage
not
too
sweet
great
wit
light
and
refreshing
when
i
dont
want
a
heavier
beer
great
in
the
summer
not
a
huge
fan
of
shandy
style
beers
but
this
beer
is
a
great
hot
day
session
beer
if
you
like
lemon
poured
into
tumbler
dirty
yellow
color
smell
is
lemon
and
yeast
taste
is
like
a
dirty
lemonade
light
carbonation
no
head
decent
lacing
did
not
like
this
at
all
not
too
bad
would
drink
again
while
it
isnt
up
there
with
some
of
the
great
craft
beers
out
now
there
is
still
nothing
more
refreshing
after
mowing
a
lawn
in
90
degree
heat
different
strokes
for
different
folks
on
this
one
i
think
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
is
awesome
it
is
a
great
summer
beer
when
its
hot
as
hell
and
you
want
something
refreshing
lemon
beer
sounds
like
a
hideous
combination
admittledly
but
this
is
good
stuff
i
usually
like
beer
from
a
glass
but
here
i
prefer
drinking
from
the
can
or
bottle
technically
this
isnt
good
beer
but
a
good
shandy
and
should
be
judged
as
such
this
is
much
better
than
the
72
rating
would
suggest
in
fresh
cans
over
the
summer
this
is
actually
decently
tasty
its
not
refined
or
all
that
remarkable
but
it
can
really
hit
the
spot
sometimes
great
summer
beer
it
tastes
exactly
like
the
style
it
is
meant
to
emulate
all
in
one
bottle
better
on
tap
or
from
a
can
doesnt
taste
quite
right
from
a
bottle
great
for
hot
summertime
drinking
pours
very
hazy
golden
color
with
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
actually
very
good
with
this
one
has
basically
a
zesty
lemon
aroma
there
is
a
light
malty
backbone
followed
by
that
lemon
zest
when
drinking
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
there
is
no
complexity
more
like
hard
lemonade
if
you
ask
me
i
enjoy
most
leinenkugels
but
summer
shandy
would
be
my
best
guess
at
what
pine
sol
tastes
like
most
of
my
friends
enjoy
it
so
it
must
be
my
messed
up
taste
buds
o
not
a
whole
lot
of
beer
flavor
going
on
but
theres
a
whole
lot
of
lemonade
flavor
a
little
too
one
sided
for
my
taste
and
there
are
better
summer
beers
out
there
all
beer
is
relative
to
the
day
a
hot
day
in
southern
california
with
limited
refreshing
options
in
the
store
not
a
double
ipa
day
based
on
my
weather
and
yard
work
90
outside
i
prefer
lemon
beer
to
lemonade
on
this
frustration
day
it
agrees
with
me
give
it
a
try
on
a
hot
day
i
dont
think
you
will
mind
its
company
its
got
more
than
you
deserve
very
refreshing
but
as
the
beer
warms
it
loses
the
refreshing
taste
the
lemon
nuances
are
definitely
there
best
served
ice
cold
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
i
love
lemon
in
the
summertime
this
brew
is
exactly
what
it
should
be
light
citrus
delicious
perfect
for
drinking
by
the
pool
side
or
in
the
hot
sun
so
much
better
a
choice
than
a
bmc
imo
as
the
sun
begins
to
set
so
too
set
this
aside
for
something
more
robust
and
interesting
but
in
the
heat
of
the
day
very
cool
i
had
to
try
it
after
seeing
commercials
on
it
and
people
talk
about
how
good
it
is
so
i
got
a
12
pack
at
the
store
for
14
so
i
thought
by
that
it
would
be
good
its
a
lemonade
flavored
light
beer
but
very
disappointing
i
thought
it
would
taste
like
beer
and
lemonade
mixed
but
instead
it
tastes
mainly
of
lemonade
with
a
slight
hint
of
beer
taste
i
have
tried
other
flavored
beers
such
as
samuel
adams
blueberry
beer
and
its
right
on
its
equal
alcohol
and
blueberry
taste
i
will
stick
to
plain
non
flavored
light
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
doesnt
like
the
beer
taste
yet
wants
to
drink
a
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
as
long
as
its
free
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
overall
an
okay
light
beer
without
the
lemonade
background
in
its
making
this
would
be
very
mediocre
as
is
its
good
enough
past
mediocre
to
be
okay
i
like
it
lemon
notes
stood
out
so
strongly
i
could
forget
i
was
drinking
a
beer
and
imagine
i
was
drinking
lemonade
it
doesnt
go
down
smooth
but
neither
does
lemonade
i
suppose
i
drained
poured
this
because
i
should
not
undergo
torture
while
drinking
beer
as
new
to
beer
drinking
i
wanted
to
try
something
on
the
lighter
side
i
got
one
in
my
make
your
own
6
pack
it
came
in
a
bottle
so
cant
really
say
on
appearance
decent
looking
label
smells
highly
of
lemon
and
citrus
tastes
the
same
as
it
smells
really
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
im
surprised
by
the
overall
rating
on
this
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
think
its
the
ideal
party
beer
for
both
craft
beer
lovers
and
noncraft
beer
drinkers
i
think
this
beer
can
be
appreciated
by
the
masses
its
not
amazing
but
its
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
all
the
lime
flavor
lagers
produced
by
the
big
guys
this
was
one
of
the
beers
that
made
me
start
to
appreciate
the
finer
beers
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
personally
but
it
certainly
has
its
time
and
place
and
is
well
done
for
what
it
is
probably
my
favorite
shandy
out
there
right
now
decent
appearance
with
a
hazy
yellow
and
a
very
thin
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
mostly
lemons
but
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
lot
of
lemonade
but
a
subtle
finish
where
you
get
a
little
bit
of
hop
and
malt
to
make
the
end
of
the
beer
not
so
sweet
a
fine
shandy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
overall
for
a
radler
this
isnt
half
bad
but
it
is
nowhere
near
the
germanaustrian
versions
of
the
style
well
its
better
than
those
stupid
lemonflavored
bud
lights
but
youll
look
just
as
gay
drinking
it
it
tastes
like
beer
mixed
with
cheap
fake
lemonade
i
swear
you
could
sell
this
stuff
at
a
lemonade
stand
and
kids
wouldnt
know
the
difference
it
tastes
like
lemonade
which
is
fine
if
you
like
your
beers
sweet
and
artificially
flavored
but
i
dont
i
bought
a
12
pack
of
these
and
now
i
feel
obligated
to
drink
them
maybe
im
being
too
harsh
the
beer
is
great
for
being
lemonade
flavored
but
why
did
i
just
buy
lemonadeflavored
beer
me
overall
its
a
decent
shandy
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
cheap
one
there
however
better
lemon
shadys
out
there
t6pp
if
i
see
this
draft
again
it
is
my
go
to
o
so
far
the
best
summer
shandy
type
that
ive
tried
definitely
sessionable
will
be
going
to
pick
up
some
more
once
summer
rolls
around
if
you
dont
want
a
strong
beer
but
rather
a
crisp
lemon
taste
with
a
little
beer
taste
get
this
if
not
i
dont
know
overall
was
kind
of
let
down
should
focus
more
on
the
beer
aspect
o
okay
feels
like
im
drinking
beer
mixed
with
lemonade
but
definitely
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
not
awful
but
its
nowhere
near
good
either
even
among
other
shandiesbeer
cocktails
there
are
better
options
this
is
my
first
shandy
and
im
let
down
lemonade
plus
good
beer
sounds
delicious
this
is
lemonade
plus
mediocre
beer
o
a
good
version
of
the
style
fuller
body
and
a
touch
more
flavorful
than
most
other
radlers
ive
had
light
gold
in
color
with
intense
haziness
eggshell
colored
head
covers
part
of
the
top
of
the
beer
intense
aroma
of
lemon
is
all
i
get
the
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
intense
lemon
flavor
thats
rally
all
there
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
would
have
enjoyed
more
if
they
had
dialed
back
the
lemon
intensity
it
is
beer
that
borders
with
kemonade
teenagers
would
like
it
it
has
wierd
aftertaste
that
possible
only
with
us
made
food
chemicals
the
idea
is
mix
real
lemonade
with
real
wheat
beer
when
brewed
in
midwest
as
one
unit
it
turned
into
chemical
wierdness
i
would
recommend
anyone
that
like
citrus
flavored
beer
to
try
this
beer
you
wont
be
disappointed
cheers
overallnot
a
go
to
beer
for
me
but
as
a
picnic
or
cooler
addition
worth
a
look
a
take
off
of
the
german
radler
this
is
what
children
drink
in
bavaria
although
it
doesnt
come
in
one
bottle
you
take
a
pilsner
or
weisse
and
mix
with
lemonade
certainly
refreshing
a
nice
sweet
drink
after
a
long
day
working
in
the
yard
really
reminds
of
my
time
in
the
beer
gardens
of
munchen
nice
work
leinenkugels
i
dont
even
know
what
type
of
beer
the
summer
shandy
is
but
it
is
already
one
of
my
favorites
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
2
at
a
time
or
may
get
tired
of
the
taste
but
is
a
great
treat
overall
heavy
mouthfeel
for
a
light
summery
kind
of
beer
too
chalky
and
reminded
me
of
lemonheads
candy
too
much
just
not
my
thing
this
beer
is
best
served
icecold
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
good
beer
for
warm
weather
i
really
enjoy
the
lemon
and
beer
combination
in
this
recipe
an
extremely
light
and
crisp
beer
with
just
enough
hops
to
make
the
flavor
explode
in
your
mouth
very
good
beer
to
drink
while
eating
at
a
barbeque
with
smoked
meats
overall
decent
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
does
not
have
any
outstanding
qualities
or
attributes
this
is
probably
my
favorite
summer
beer
you
can
smell
the
lemon
and
citrus
scents
as
soon
as
you
get
your
nose
near
this
beer
it
tastes
refreshing
as
soon
as
the
beer
touches
your
lips
afterwards
you
are
left
with
a
lemon
taste
in
your
mouth
that
is
delicious
definitely
take
it
easy
as
you
can
down
34
without
even
knowing
you
consumed
them
overall
it
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
during
the
summer
due
to
how
refreshing
and
light
it
is
i
would
not
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
having
a
bottle
every
once
in
a
while
i
can
see
myself
doing
overall
not
bad
just
not
my
type
of
beer
its
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
and
i
bet
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
however
its
mid
april
not
summer
and
this
is
already
released
whats
next
oktoberfest
in
august
anyway
back
on
point
hot
day
or
not
i
would
rather
have
a
traditional
hefe
over
this
any
day
wonderful
shandy
and
perfect
for
every
summer
evening
undertones
of
the
wheat
base
but
a
crisp
lemon
aftertaste
not
overpowering
doesnt
linger
long
not
too
fruity
as
some
of
these
beers
can
be
leinies
got
this
one
right
best
served
icecold
maybe
colder
or
fresher
gift
from
someone
who
doesnt
know
beer
would
have
helped
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
i
like
the
orange
variety
better
i
am
sure
as
i
get
more
into
tasting
and
knowing
the
complexities
of
beer
i
will
look
back
and
laugh

o
im
not
crazy
over
this
by
any
means
but
it
does
serve
its
purpose
on
a
hot
day
ill
drink
it
if
its
around
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
unless
someone
was
requesting
it
i
have
a
hard
time
calling
this
a
beer
as
there
is
nothing
here
that
resembles
a
beer
or
at
least
what
i
consider
beer
that
said
i
enjoy
it
a
bit
of
a
guilty
pleasure
if
you
will
easy
to
drink
and
thirstquenching
definitely
a
good
beverage
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
great
crisp
light
body
summer
ale
cool
refreshing
lemony
beer
to
enjoy
at
the
end
of
a
summer
day
this
is
my
go
to
beer
great
cook
outs
and
camping
it
pours
with
a
nice
head
and
great
carbonation
this
beer
makes
it
really
feel
like
summer
is
here
es
i
know
its
from
the
majors
and
its
a
shandy
but
it
was
tasty
and
i
didnt
feel
dirty
after
drinking
it
and
liking
it
the
way
i
thought
i
would
have
overall
an
inoffensive
drink
guess
it
works
as
a
thirst
quencher
although
there
us
a
little
maltiness
detectable
in
this
product
the
predominant
taste
is
much
like
cheap
lemonade
manufactured
with
reconstituted
lemon
juice
the
alcohol
content
is
so
low
you
can
get
much
tastier
summer
refreshment
by
drinking
good
lemonade
and
adding
alcohol
of
your
choice
diont
waste
your
money
on
this
product
this
is
about
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
its
decent
but
theres
nothing
special
about
it
theres
a
time
and
place
for
summer
shandy
this
beer
is
pretty
gross
wouldnt
seek
out
over
all
i
am
not
a
fan
of
these
fruity
summer
beers
to
be
fair
i
had
a
6
pack
of
these
over
a
few
days
to
give
a
review
the
first
one
to
me
was
horrible
the
next
not
so
bad
after
finishing
the
pack
this
is
really
a
refreshing
summer
drink
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
bold
hops
or
really
malty
do
not
expect
that
with
this
beer
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
you
will
enjoy
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
tastes
like
candy
the
artificial
lemon
tasted
isnt
there
for
me
it
tasted
more
like
lemonade
i
do
taste
some
wheat
in
this
beer
but
the
lemon
is
dominant
in
this
beer
i
would
pick
this
beer
up
in
the
summer
on
a
hot
day
sometimes
you
cant
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
this
beer
isnt
like
a
bud
light
lime
or
something
of
that
nature
unfortunate
its
not
getting
much
love
on
this
review
page
oi
grabbed
this
beer
as
a
sortof
palate
cleanser
before
heading
out
for
dinner
oops
i
suppose
the
palate
cleansing
was
accomplished
but
at
the
cost
of
a
few
hundred
calories
that
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
brew
is
kinda
ugly
fake
smelling
and
tasting
and
generally
not
very
good
buyer
beware
o
meh
this
is
alright
good
for
sitting
out
in
the
hot
sun
like
i
am
right
now
but
you
know
theres
not
much
going
on
here
i
can
hardly
taste
any
lemon
great
for
berberques
and
all
but
id
probably
be
better
off
making
my
own
shandys
refreshing
really
easy
to
drink
doesnt
taste
like
beer
and
doesnt
taste
like
alcohol
mostly
a
natural
lemon
drink
with
bubbles
honestly
i
could
drink
an
even
more
lemoney
drink
in
higher
abv
like
this
kind
of
style
but
this
tastes
excellent
and
with
no
bitterness
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
was
a
refreshing
and
bold
surprise
i
had
it
indoors
but
i
think
it
would
have
truly
and
really
hit
the
spot
if
i
had
had
it
outdoors
on
a
hot
night
although
cloudy
to
the
eye
it
is
an
appealing
shade
of
yellow
with
some
lacing
not
only
can
you
distinctly
taste
the
lemonadelike
flavor
to
the
beer
but
you
could
smell
it
which
is
a
plus
to
me
it
was
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
look
for
it
again
well
you
could
have
handed
me
this
in
a
can
and
i
would
have
had
no
clue
that
it
was
a
beer
and
not
just
a
lemon
citrus
pop
which
im
sure
is
going
to
yield
some
rough
ratings
and
reviews
on
here
however
to
me
if
its
a
hot
day
id
take
this
in
a
heartbeat
its
very
refreshing
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
but
if
i
can
get
it
for
cheap
count
me
in
for
a
pack
an
added
plus
is
that
it
is
union
made
by
my
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
uaw
just
dont
order
it
at
your
neighborhood
bar
you
will
be
disappointed
unless
thats
where
you
go
when
your
hot
and
sweaty
o
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
refreshing
and
a
nice
way
to
beat
the
heat
but
it
isnt
enticing
enough
for
me
to
want
it
more
than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
cool
beverage
perfect
for
when
you
finish
mowing
the
lawn
overall
summer
shandy
is
decent
i
would
drink
this
as
a
lawn
mower
beer
if
someone
gave
me
it
i
would
not
ever
buy
it
for
myself
mainly
because
that
is
not
my
go
to
brew
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
a
shandy
in
the
summer
but
not
to
any
serious
craft
beer
fanatic
had
this
on
tap
at
redamaks
in
new
buffalo
mi
and
it
really
cut
through
the
amazing
burger
i
had
the
summer
shandy
has
intense
meyer
lemon
aromatics
and
taste
white
flower
florals
and
a
lightly
crisp
body
extremely
easy
drinking
with
balanced
juicy
flavors
i
just
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
love
the
taste
flavor
was
wonderful
the
smell
reminded
me
of
drinking
lemonade
when
i
was
a
kid
it
had
a
smooth
taste
and
was
not
over
powering
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
now
will
definitely
be
purchasingover
and
over
again
o
a
pleasing
summer
brew
its
not
rocket
science
or
reinventing
weiss
beer
but
the
formula
works
an
adventurous
taste
perfect
for
summertime
fun
is
leinies
slogan
for
it
i
agree
admittedly
im
not
a
big
fan
of
shandy
but
i
found
this
particular
brew
to
be
enjoyable
the
lemon
flavor
is
very
strong
but
it
is
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
its
a
strange
combination
like
it
doesnt
know
it
it
wants
to
be
a
beer
or
a
mikes
hard
but
if
this
is
the
type
of
flavor
you
are
looking
for
you
will
probably
like
it
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
abv
i
was
hoping
for
more
than
4
2
i
will
continue
to
drink
these
during
the
summer
as
it
has
become
my
go
to
summer
beer
low
c
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
2013
im
a
big
fan
of
the
shandy
and
summertime
is
the
perfect
time
of
year
for
this
typical
part
fruit
juice
normally
lemonade
part
beer
and
a
dash
of
honey
brew
typical
of
turn
of
the
century
eastern
european
brewerys
the
beer
goes
down
much
easier
than
it
is
to
pronounce
excellent
thick
foam
head
and
strong
lacing
deep
weiss
wheat
yellow
color
full
and
cloudy
body
carbonation
is
good
but
not
rising
frothy
in
nature
typical
lemon
shandy
aroma
minute
maid
with
a
dash
of
hops
crisp
light
mouth
feel
very
light
beer
in
nature
honey
and
lemon
nose
lemonade
and
lager
midpalate
good
hops
skunk
well
lagered
but
lightened
by
the
juice
over
tones
back
palate
its
all
sugar
water
and
just
a
hint
of
malt
a
little
oak
not
crisp
dare
i
say
wet
almost
too
watered
down
on
the
aftertaste
my
home
mixed
shandies
tend
to
have
more
bit
on
the
palate
more
malt
a
thickness
associated
normally
with
the
syrup
of
soda
less
wet
more
sour
maybe
im
picking
a
bit
heavy
here
but
the
saranac
summer
shandy
in
this
case
from
2011
was
much
better
i
would
still
pick
this
over
a
mikes
hard
lemonade
which
has
that
manufactured
feel
to
it
too
much
sugar
not
enough
beer
3
out
of
5
okay
needs
improvement
saving
grace
is
a
good
lemon
to
honey
balance
along
with
high
drinkability
i
would
kick
this
back
while
doing
yard
work
or
maybe
just
sitting
by
the
pool
bbq
will
wreck
it
and
over
power
it
be
forewarned
overall
its
a
nice
drink
for
summer
bbqs
or
at
the
golf
course
i
dont
see
it
as
a
sessional
drink
but
it
is
light
and
refreshing
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
a
very
dull
overly
sweat
beer
low
abv
and
very
small
amount
of
hops
not
a
great
beer
for
me
my
neighbor
loves
it
thought
so
you
very
well
may
as
well
it
really
tastes
very
lemony
but
not
subtle
lemon
like
some
beers
i
have
had
that
are
brewed
with
lemon
rind
more
like
it
was
cut
with
lemonade
or
they
used
a
very
potent
lemon
extract
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
refreshing
beer
that
is
perfect
for
summer
its
not
going
to
wow
anybody
but
its
a
solid
offering
in
the
style
o
if
youre
presented
with
this
at
a
bbq
this
summer
pass
grab
a
coke
or
7up
instead
well
i
have
to
start
by
saying
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
on
this
one
i
live
in
houston
and
i
drink
live
oak
hefe
on
the
reg
and
i
always
have
it
served
with
a
lemon
slice
so
when
i
see
this
at
the
store
say
traditional
weisse
with
lemon
i
think
its
something
i
could
enjoy
pours
a
cloudy
lemonade
color
with
a
couple
finger
head
that
doesnt
last
almost
no
lacing
as
the
glass
goes
down
all
lemon
on
the
scent
more
lemon
on
the
taste
than
i
would
like
for
the
style
i
expected
a
weisse
with
a
lemon
hint
not
a
mixture
of
beer
and
lemonade
overall
its
ok
im
not
going
to
pour
it
out
or
anything
but
its
defiantly
not
something
im
going
to
seek
out
again
this
one
is
probably
a
bit
underrated
here
on
ba
its
got
a
pale
hazy
yellow
glow
with
a
sudsy
white
head
aver
an
inch
tall
the
nose
is
akin
to
a
decent
berliner
weiss
lactic
and
tart
while
also
lemony
and
light
it
feels
less
like
a
half
lager
half
lemonade
than
it
does
a
brewed
beer
with
lemon
its
zesty
and
acidic
refreshing
and
light
very
fresh
and
the
lemon
presence
is
huge
here
its
got
a
nice
drinkability
and
is
very
easy
down
good
bubbles
minimal
body
although
not
sodalike
as
some
can
be
i
love
how
real
the
lemons
taste
not
artificial
at
all
and
i
think
the
proportions
are
right
ive
been
recently
appreciating
the
shandy
style
and
this
one
is
sort
of
the
original
in
the
united
states
i
like
it
much
better
than
many
other
leiny
offerings
and
would
be
happy
to
have
this
constantly
on
deck
all
summer
especially
in
the
mornings
and
early
afternoons
really
this
is
pretty
good
its
sweet
it
has
overpowering
lemon
flavor
and
it
kind
of
tastes
like
beer
its
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
and
leinenkugels
will
try
to
make
you
feel
good
about
drinking
it
o
could
be
worse
but
just
too
synthetic
and
sodalike
for
me
to
love
really
does
taste
like
sprit
lemon
aid
carbonation
is
distracting
this
is
about
the
best
commercial
shandy
ive
tried
i
really
like
this
as
a
lunch
beer
when
the
weather
gets
hot
oan
okay
beer
that
would
be
good
on
a
very
hot
day
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
find
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
thought
the
lemon
would
be
overpowering
but
only
had
hints
of
it
i
mean
you
can
smell
and
taste
that
its
there
but
its
not
too
overpowering
for
me
had
a
good
wheat
appearance
decent
head
nothing
to
brag
about
only
downer
for
me
was
it
was
about
average
on
the
beer
end
of
it
i
think
it
would
be
allot
better
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
bit
if
there
was
nothing
else
id
get
it
again
o
sessionable
if
you
can
handle
the
constant
barrage
of
lemonade
o
i
got
this
after
trying
fentimans
shandy
which
i
got
because
i
had
heard
of
this
shandy
and
looked
up
the
style
fentimans
is
sweet
and
tastes
almost
like
a
cola
but
this
is
more
towards
the
beer
and
lemon
side
of
it
overall
drinkability
i
think
this
is
pretty
close
to
being
a
real
shandy
just
wish
the
beer
had
more
backbone
to
it
and
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
more
interesting
beer
rather
than
just
an
average
one
however
i
will
give
it
high
marks
for
being
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
otherwise
nothing
special
never
heard
of
this
beer
until
i
moved
to
omaha
some
guests
left
it
behind
at
my
hotel
so
i
decided
to
try
it
my
first
drink
made
me
smile
it
was
not
what
i
expected
when
drinking
a
beer
the
bubbles
reminded
me
of
a
soda
pop
lemon
and
orange
easy
to
drink
found
just
in
time
to
kick
off
summer
o
not
impressed
the
smell
far
outweighs
the
taste
almost
like
a
michelob
ultra
overall
this
is
my
wifes
favorite
beer
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
refreshing
i
also
like
that
it
isnt
overly
sweet
im
more
of
a
fan
of
subtle
fruit
beers
however
and
the
lemon
is
a
bit
overpowering
for
me
overall
a
great
beer
to
refresh
your
mouth
on
a
summer
day
i
am
glad
six
pack
of
this
last
night
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
beer
in
future
ths
is
a
grea
beer
o
for
the
non
beer
beer
drinker
this
may
be
a
fun
thing
to
try
craft
enthusiasts
should
pass
i
can
see
it
being
a
good
summer
beer
or
a
beer
for
someone
that
normally
doesnt
drink
beer
for
me
though
i
think
i
will
pass
next
time
ive
heard
a
lot
of
take
about
this
but
everyone
has
a
different
taste
this
taste
like
lemonade
and
if
youre
a
fan
of
smirnoff
you
would
probably
prefer
this
because
it
is
manageable
taste
wise
if
youre
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sweetness
in
the
smirnoff
i
could
probably
drink
more
than
a
few
i
e
manage
a
six
pack
without
feeling
sick
i
would
accept
this
drink
but
probably
not
buy
it
personally
just
because
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
appearance
if
leinenkugel
summer
shandy
is
a
pale
yellow
color
the
aroma
of
it
is
a
lemon
and
citrus
smell
which
i
like
a
lot
it
tastes
like
lemony
beer
as
well
and
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
overall
taste
and
appearance
is
perfect
for
summer
and
really
anytime
if
you
like
lemonade
you
will
love
this
it
does
not
have
the
typical
beer
taste
to
it
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
perfect
for
enjoying
out
in
the
sun
of
a
really
hot
summer
day
o
not
big
on
flavored
beers
to
much
lemon
not
enough
depth
kind
of
boring
and
bland
not
terrible
its
drinkable
and
solid
for
what
it
is
for
a
hot
summer
day
itd
be
nice
i
mostly
drink
it
in
summer
on
the
boat
if
your
new
to
beers
and
dont
necessarily
like
beer
all
that
much

there
is
nothing
in

to

it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
lab
experiment
that
some
uneducated
person
or
persons
thought
might
pass
as
a
beer
they
were
so
wrong
cant
see
the
attraction
to
this
one
not

at
all
gave
the
rest
of
the

nearly

wanted

lighter

decent

definitely
a

and
not
my

at
all
but
i
can
see
a
market
for
it
during
the
summertime
taste
is
decent
malty
and
grainy
with
lemonade
a
slight
hint
of
hops
on
the
finish
a
bit
thin
but
not
bad
for
a
hot
summer
day
really
easy
to
drink
too
overall
a
cheap
beer
which
isnt
going
to
win
any

it
can
prove
to
be
very
refreshing
and

on

which
gives
the

life

the

this

very

9
im
enjoying
this
beer
by
the
pool
in
las
vegas
which
is
how
it
was
meant
the
low
reviews
this
beer
is
getting
i
regret
are
from
folks
who
are
too
serious
and
not
regardig
the
context
in
which
they
make
their
reviews
lighten
up
a
little
get
it
enjoy
this
delight
in
the
100
degree
desert
like
me
and
youll
see
what
i
mean
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
this
tastes
like
lemonade
mixed
with
a
pale
ale
which
i
guess
is
exactly
what
it
should
taste
like
hard
to
evaluate
since
the
lemon
is
so
dominantfrom
initial
taste
through
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
i
would
say
that
it
is
refreshing
after
walking
12
miles
it
doesnt
necessarily
make
this
a
good
beerjust
easy
to
drink
soft
drink
carbonation
but
decently
bodied
had
never
heard
of
the
brewer
but
have
bought
a
number
of
their
beer
recently
as
part
of
pick
6
sales
at
the
local
market
slight
leamonaid
flavor
crisp
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
nice
head
and
aroma
i
might
buy
this
beer
on
occasion
in
the
future
but
would
not
search
for
the
beer
if
headed
for
a
party
and
i
wanted
to
impress
friends
with
my
selections
only
time
i
could
see
enjoying
this
would
be
on
a
very
hot
day
and
if
i
was
very
thirsty
definitely
not
something
i
will
likely
try
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
opaque
cloudedyellow
coloring
that
is
pale
and
murky
with
a
thin
filmy
coating
of
white
head
along
the
top
aromas
of
roasted
wheat
are
drowned
out
by
a
tart
sweet
lemon
zest
bouncing
out
of
the
glass
flavors
are
very
lemon
heavy
with
a
tart
effervescence
that
hits
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
the
roof
of
the
mouth
like
someone
poured
a
fresca
into
a
wheat
beer
smooth
roasted
wheat
backbone
that
supports
the
lemondrop
sweet
main
palate
the
aftertaste
is
tangy
and
syrupy
sweet
like
you
just
ate
a
bag
of
lemon
jolly
ranchers
the
finish
is
smooth
and
light
with
a
slight
effervescence
to
it
as
well
all
in
all
i
can
see
how
some
people
like
this
but
it
is
definitely
not
my
mug
of
beer
bottle
poured
a
light
bright
yellow
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
with
sweet
lemonade
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
sweet
lemonade
notes
with
sweet
malt
body
is
light
with
average
carbonation
refreshing
drink
though
it
is
almost
alien
to
beer
call
me
crazy
but
this
is
a
really
solid
summer
beer
so
chugable
overall
it
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
with
the
lemon
and
all
but
il
definatly
be
drinking
more
of
this
great
abv
as
well
saw
this
on
the
menu
at
the
pike
here
in
reading
pa
i
normally
dont
go
for
fruity
beers
but
this
one
was
interesting
first
noticed
the
color
and
the
abscence
of
any
head
probably
not
one
of
the
big
movers
and
that
is
why
the
lack
of
head
leinenkugel
makes
many
good
brews
but
for
my
taste
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
am
a
dogfish
addict
i
tried
this
ontap
at
a
small
local
bar
in
janesville
wi
this
summer
seasonal
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
mild
scent
of
lemons
and
straw
smooth
lemony
flavor
with
cheap
straw
grains
a
little
too
watery
but
still
a
great
refreshing
drink
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
one
of
my
wifes
friends
left
this
and
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
try
for
the
review
actually
better
than
i
expected
but
i
didnt
expect
much
passable
as
an
outdoor
summer
beer
pours
yellow
and
diaphanous
with
a
etched
white
surface
some
spotty
residuals
on
the
rim
smells
like
lemon
juice
and
a
bit
of
detergent
really
not
much
else
going
in
the
nose
for
me
its
ceratainly
lemony
but
in
a
antibacterial
sense
taste
is
empty
wheat
water
with
a
bit
of
artificial
lemon
flavor
like
the
innards
of
a
lemon
head
candy
not
the
sour
part
very
commercial
to
me
in
a
bad
way
water
body
with
moderately
hi
carb
and
an
unobtrusive
finish
i
can
see
why
many
folks
dig
this
and
why
my
wi
buddy
asked
me
to
find
some
for
her
and
why
she
also
loves
the
beast
outta
milwaukee
notes
two
notes
hit
you
at
different
times
and
neither
is
all
that
great
or
complex
it
does
its
job
of
being
a
nice
summer
beverage
not
overly
tart
or
sweet
a
good
alternative
to
lemonade
without
being
overly
sweet
as
a
beverage
it
has
its
place
but
as
a
beer
it
is
sub
par
on
tap
this
beer
was
a
light
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
it
reminded
me
of
a
lemon
meringue
pie
the
retention
was
only
soso
though
it
did
stick
around
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
was
scattered
the
aroma
was
of
lemons
with
hints
of
floral
hops
behind
that
the
flavors
too
were
dominated
by
lemons
but
as
it
warmed
up
i
tasted
some
crystal
malt
and
a
light
note
of
bready
malt
it
started
sweet
but
finished
dry
helping
it
to
be
a
highly
refreshing
beershandy
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
mouthfeel
average
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
for
me
it
has
nice
carbonation
the
fragrance
below
average
it
should
have
a
much
stronger
fragrance
of
lemon
since
its
lemon
the
beer
touts
as
one
of
the
selling
points
needs
a
stronger
lemon
up
front
not
just
the
hint
on
the
after
taste
an
above
average
summer
cook
out
beer
o
its
nice
for
a
hot
day
drinks
smoothly
and
light
wheat
note
is
lacking
lemon
can
seem
a
bit
fake
like
lemonade
made
from
powder
and
sugar
decent
keep
in
mind
that
the
kind
of
glass
you
use
does
make
a
difference
in
head
head
retention
how
it
releases
the
aroma
and
ultimately
how
much
you
will
enjoy
it
o
i
enjoy
lemonade
but
the
flavor
of
this
beer
does
not
agree
with
me
buy
this
beer
if
you
like
watery
lemon
cough
drops
it
should
be
noted
that
not
everything
this
brewery
puts
out
is
crap
they
actually
make
a
decent
imperial
stout
and
ipa
dont
know
what
happened
to
this
recipe
this
beers
not
gonna
win
any
complexity
or
flavor
awards
but
for
what
it
is
an
arnold
palmer
with
beer
instead
of
iced
tea
it
gets
the
job
done
great
on
the
beach
during
a
hot
summer
day
shandy
beer
lemonade
know
what
youre
getting
into
its
a
premixed
beer
cocktail
and
obviously
not
solely
a
beer
these
things
tend
to
show
up
at
july
4th
parties
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
go
pours
like
a
cloudy
american
wheat
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
aroma
is
pure
lemon
while
the
flavor
incorporates
a
bit
more
beer
pretty
standard
light
wheat
with
little
hop
character
the
lemon
character
is
exactly
like
lemon
drop
candy
i
guess
its
decent
for
a
bottled
shandy
id
rather
just
make
my
own
with
a
better
quality
lemonade
and
beer
eh
not
bad
but
probably
not
the
beer
lovers
kinda
beer
has
more
in
common
with
the
fruity
alcoholic
drinks
mikes
and
such
decent
for
a
summer
refresher
though
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
summer
beer
it
does
taste
less
beerlike
than
many
brews
but
if
the
radler
is
a
partbeer
and
partlemonade
mix
then
i
think
this
may
be
spoton
overall
its
an
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
and
nice
for
a
hot
night
outside
hazy
pale
straw
body
with
a
nice
head
that
laces
well
never
had
a
shandy
before
nor
a
lemon
beer
and
i
am
now
fairly
sure
i
dont
want
another
one
lemon
on
then
nose
lemon
in
the
body
surprisingly
i
can
tell
this
is
a
beer
thigh
with
a
fairly
viscous
body
that
feels
like
a
beer
i
guess
this
could
be
seen
as
a
great
summer
beer
by
some
but
i
dont
like
it
half
way
through
the
pour
i
figured
what
the
hell
lets
add
the
lemon
but
definitely
a
summer
beer
not
something
i
can
drink
all
the
time
carbonation
was
off
overall
not
really
impressed
and
probably
wont
try
this
type
of
beer
again
ive
tried
a
few
different
types
of
fruitvegetable
beers
and
ive
yet
to
find
one
i
really
like
overall
not
the
best
summer
beer
by
far
but
worth
trying
id
say
give
it
a
go
its
a
great
summer
beer
to
complement
a
summer
bbq
or
day
at
the
poollakebeach
this
beer
is
a
great
summertime
beer
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
the
only
thing
bad
i
have
to
say
about
the
beer
is
the
very
low
alcohol
content
of
only
4
2
its
half
lemonaide
and
half
beer
the
color
reminds
me
of
carbonated
lemonaide
you
can
easily
drink
a
6
pack
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
just
wish
the
abv
was
around
6
if
youre
drinking
this
you
know
its
a
shandy
as
clearly
stated
on
the
label
summer
shandy
smell
is
lemony
certainly
refreshing
taste
is
lightly
malty
wheat
beer
with
a
refreshing
dose
of
lightly
tart
lemonade
its
just
about
right
for
sweetness
in
terms
of
the
lemonade
flavor
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
but
its
one
of
the
better
flavored
mass
produced
beers
ive
had
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
because
i
didnt
feel
like
having
the
taste
of
regular
beer
in
my
mouth
the
next
morning
easy
to
drink
smells
nice
tastes
like
lemons
as
everybody
else
has
said
though
with
the
low
alcohol
content
it
doesnt
really
get
you
drunk
a
good
beer
to
pick
up
if
you
want
to
have
some
ladies
over
who
cant
handle
any
other
beer
something
id
drink
from
time
to
time
if
i
needed
a
filler
to
keep
my
buzz
going
pours
a
hazy
nontransparent
straw
yellow
rolls
about
a
1
finger
head
that
forms
to
a
lace
around
the
top
of
the
glass
carbonation
is
visible
at
the
top
the
most
dominate
flavor
on
the
noseand
pretty
much
the
only
flavor
is
that
of
powdered
lemonade
mix
very
sugary
with
a
lemon
exctract
hints
of
wheat
maybe
not
sure
if
it
is
brewed
with
wheat
or
if
my
brain
just
wants
to
think
so
sugar
water
with
a
slice
of
lemon
on
the
side
a
grainy
corn
is
on
the
after
taste
medium
carbonation
tingles
when
entering
the
mouth
light
bodied
very
soft
drink
like
overall
this
is
pretty
terrible
even
the
fruit
like
flavors
taste
off
and
generic
stay
clear
of
this
unless
you
really
really
like
lemonade
mix
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
pretty
much
solely
of
lemonlime
soda
and
lemonade
mixed
together
taste
is
the
same
with
a
grain
flavor
that
comes
out
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
prickly
level
of
carbonation
but
its
a
bit
thin
overall
this
is
not
exactly
good
but
its
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
on
the
very
edge
of
not
being
beer
in
my
opinion
at
4
2
abv
its
very
easy
to
pound
a
few
without
even
thinking
about
it
very
refreshing
outdoor
beer
but
not
one
i
would
recommend
if
you
have
a
crew
of
craft
beer
lovers
coming
over
overall
not
a
real
flavorful
beer
but
not
an
offensive
one
it
would
be
great
for
sitting
outside
with
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
consider
it
a
good
hot
weather
session
brew
but
not
one
i
would
recommend
on
any
other
occasion
on
draft
at
a
ball
game
cloudy
light
yellow
with
little
head
aroma
is
lemonade
sugar
light
bread
and
very
mild
hops
taste
is
lemon
sugar
and
mild
beer
flavors
its
like
4
2
abv
kool
aid
thin
mouthfeel
meh
way
more
of
a
lemonade
than
a
beer
for
sure
rjt
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
although
i
cant
drink
this
because
its
a
killer
for
people
with
acid
reflux
o
session
friendly
kicked
many
of
these
back
in
college
great
beer
for
chilling
around
the
housepoollake
on
a
nice
michigan
summer
day
the
lemony
aspect
of
this
i
kind
of
enjoyed
but
i
think
that
the
base
beer
that
they
used
is
just
south
of
lackluster
overall
a
summer
brew
most
definitely
overall
decent
summer
brew
goes
nice
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
a
summer
dessert
beer
so
this
is
what
they
call
a
radler
a
german
style
of
a
cross
between
lemonade
and
beer
ok
interesting
im
not
exactly
sure
what
to
say
other
than
i
cant
guarantee
id
have
this
again
maybe
id
have
it
again
alongside
the
sunset
wheat
and
feel
like
id
have
a
great
dessert
or
maybe
id
give
this
to
the
malt
drinker
to
let
them
see
the
beer
side
this
beer
gets
ragged
on
unnecessarily
i
think
because
its
sweet
and
not
very
beery
kind
of
a
gateway
beer
its
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
i
might
keep
some
around
for
the
less
beerinclined
among
us
it
goes
down
too
easily
its
best
to
skip
it
if
youre
thirsty
it
tastes
more
like
lemonade
than
a
beer
this
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
some
other
shandystyle
beers
ive
had
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
good
by
any
means
this
is
more
lemonade
than
beer
and
artificial
and
sugary
at
that
ill
pass
note
this
beer
is
not
brewed
with
lemons
as
some
people
might
suggest
it
is
beer
with
natural
lemonade
flavor
says
so
right
on
the
label
i
can
definitely
see
the
appeal
of
this
one
its
just
not
my
thing
im
not
sure
how
traditional
this
shandy
is
anyways
this
is
a
very
simple
wheat
beer
brewed
with
lemon
its
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
had
many
beers
like
this
in
germany
the
main
reason
i
am
reviewing
this
beer
is
cause
i
feel
its
overall
score
is
low
do
to
people
reviewing
it
and
say
it
taste
like
lemon
why
would
someone
brew
this
first
of
all
it
says
brewed
with
lemon
so
the
lemon
stands
out
why
would
you
try
this
beer
if
you
have
a
problem
with
the
lemon
taste
i
like
it
a
lot
reminds
me
of
germany
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
yellowish
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
heavily
of
lemons
but
there
is
general
beer
malt
in
the
smell
as
well
tastes
of
a
lemonade
mixed
with
a
good
adjunct
lager
but
not
offensively
this
light
bodied
beer
is
very
smooth
carbonated
correctly
and
quite
a
bit
could
be
consumed
without
realizing
it
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
and
i
suggest
giving
it
a
try
especially
if
you
like
citrusy
beers
o
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
could
knock
out
a
few
of
these
on
a
summer
day
especially
a
hot
one
not
more
than
a
few
though
since
this
one
has
a
bit
of
an
odd
aftertaste
drinkability
repeatable
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
price
point
make
this
an
attractive
beer
for
the
summer
months
the
tartness
is
quite
refreshing
the
lemony
smell
surprised
at
first
but
it
turned
out
okay
i
like
the
way
the
flavor
keeps
shifting
from
sour
lemon
and
lime
to
maltysweet
to
acidic
orange
its
a
bit
unexpected
and
definitely
adds
to
the
beers
appeal
it
would
be
great
for
a
hot
day
o
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
very
sessionable
the
perfect
delicious
beer
for
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
if
i
am
going
to
mix
lemonade
and
beer
i
will
stick
with
sol
or
corona
pours
like
a
wheat
beer
hazy
straw
yellow
small
head
that
fizzles
away
aroma
is
lemony
and
artificial
musty
lemon
like
cleaning
product
and
lemon
drop
candy
wrapped
into
a
blanket
of
grain
taste
is
full
of
lemon
syrup
with
a
wheat
malt
base
tangy
but
not
without
a
touch
of
bitterness
like
watery
lemon
candy
soda
fleeting
grain
reminds
you
this
is
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
crisp
carbonation
and
lingering
lemon
flavor
overall
it
is
lemony
t
altough
its
a
mixed
beer
its
refreshing
and
tastes
good
at
least
ther
is
some
bitter
after
taste
that
is
a
little
bit
nice
appearance
is
pure
gold
with
some
cloudy
smell
is
strong
with
lemon
mouthfeel
has
some
lingering
to
it
with
a
pleasant
sweet
tartness
the
taste
is
strong
with
the
lemonaid
this
is
a
great
taste
on
a
good
hot
90
degree
day
here
in
pa
overall
this
is
a
true
seasonal
beer
good
in
the
summer
let
us
have
some
burgers
and
dogs
a
very
okay
summer
beer
although
i
am
sure
i
would
like
it
better
if
i
was
drinking
it
on
a
hot
summers
night
instead
of
on
a
cold
october
night
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
it
is
a
good
selection
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
drinkability
great
novelty
beer
does
well
what
im
sure
it
set
out
to
do
taste
like
lemonade
drink
it
when
the
thermometer
breaks
90
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
grab
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
goes
down
easy
and
really
satisfies
your
thirst
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
drinkers
who
do
not
like
flavored
beers
should
avoid
this
do
points
scored
on
the
drinkability
aspect
not
the
overall
one
aspects
evened
out
used
for
my
score
here
made
me
burp
a
lot
due
to
the
high
carbonation
if
you
enjoy
this
one
seek
out
the
potosi
steamboat
shandy
i
found
it
to
be
much
more
enjoyable
o
actually
didnt
mind
this
one
too
much
the
aroma
was
much
better
than
the
flavor
though
overall
this
a
suprisingly
decent
beer
for
the
style
attempt
if
you
have
had
shandies
they
are
sweet
and
slightly
malt
this
nearly
passes
for
fanta
id
drink
some
after
a
long
bike
ride
or
day
in
the
sun
d
a
lame
example
of
something
in
between
if
i
want
lemonade
ill
make
some
if
i
want
a
decent
beer
ill
have
one
this
is
neither
o
i
havent
been
very
fond
of
leinie
products
in
the
past
but
this
one
was
actually
pretty
decent
the
base
beer
seems
very
onedimensional
but
the
addition
of
lemon
makes
it
a
bit
more
interesting
i
love
lemonade
on
a
hot
south
texas
day
almost
as
much
as
i
love
a
cold
beer
and
this
is
a
good
marriage
of
the
two
o
with
a
modest
4
2
abv
and
bright
lemonade
flavors
this
is
a
decent
heat
killer
however
i
honestly
might
have
to
take
a
pepcid
or
tums
before
during
and
after
because
right
now
theres
acid
churning
around
my
stomach
the
hotter
the
better
for
this
one
this
beer
is
not
terrible
it
is
definitely
a
refreshing
summer
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
6pack
i
recommend
it
as
a
compliment
to
a
cook
out
or
to
cool
down
after
a
hot
day
would
pair
well
with
any
finger
food
o
easily
drinkable
great
taste
wish
it
was
available
year
round
perfect
beer
for
summer
ive
had
it
tap
bottle
and
can
equally
enjoyable
each
time
d
overall
would
make
a
good
summer
drink
not
something
i
would
more
than
one
of
the
sour
and
sugary
lemon
taste
is
a
little
too
much
o
probably
not
going
to
seek
this
one
out
often
it
could
be
great
after
a
long
hot
day
of
yard
work
but
not
many
other
times
than
that
o
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
brew
a
lemonade
beer
is
not
something
i
normally
would
drink
but
found
this
quite
refreshing
not
sure
how
many
i
could
have
in
a
sitting
but
on
a
hot
humid
day
doing
yard
work
this
would
be
a
good
choice
the
tastes
is
actually
better
than
i
expected
with
nice
lemony
and
slight
citrus
peel
tinges
with
slight
malt
flavor
rounding
out
the
flavor
with
slight
astringent
in
the
back
of
the
throat
like
lemonade
but
the
shandy
maintains
a
balance
of
mild
malt
with
tart
lemon
and
seems
to
finish
uncannily
clean
overall
what
can
i
say
i
like
this
as
a
summer
quencher
and
could
probably
enjoy
this
year
round
it
is
really
decent
if
you
enjoy
arnold
palmers
or
tea
coolers
depending
on
what
you
refer
to
them
as
the
malt
is
mild
and
the
lemony
flavor
refreshes
in
a
natural
way
i
consider
this
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
overall
heaven
on
a
hot
day
seriously
loved
this
beer
o
this
one
is
a
near
perfect
hot
summer
day
beer
that
you
can
down
several
of
not
the
best
beer
for
a
hearty
experience
but
hot
and
outdoors
bring
it
on
just
make
sure
its
good
and
cold
kinda
goes
funky
when
it
warms
up
depite
this
i
cannot
deny
that
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
i
liked
it
and
i
will
no
doubt
be
drinking
this
again
o
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
ever
order
again
my
fatherinlaw
gave
me
this
to
see
what
i
thought
sampled
from
a
bottle
best
by
101011
bright
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
white
cap
that
was
the
best
part
surprisingly
medium
bodied
with
assertive
carbonation
smell
and
taste
was
lemons
with
orange
zest
the
aftertaste
basically
left
you
feeling
as
though
you
were
drinking
lemon
concentrate
this
is
a
beer
that
would
be
enjoyed
by
nondrinkers
or
coors
light
lovers
the
summer
shandy
to
me
is
alot
like
mikes
hard
lemonade
or
smirnov
ice
or
spikes
countrytime
lemonade
the
appearance
is
yellow
with
with
head
the
nose
is
very
lemony
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
combonation
of
lemmon
and
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
too
tart
for
me
and
wouldnt
drink
this
stuff
very
often
is
this
a
really
light
and
unrefined
beverage
yes
but
its
damn
tasty
in
the
sun
from

sampled

2011
the
pour
is
lemon
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
lemon
zing
haze
and
a
huge
puffy
head
this
reeks
of
lemon
zing
to
the
point
that
i
get
little
else
except
a
whisper
of
fresh
hops
and
grain
but
i
gave
it
a
3
5
on
the
aroma
because
it
didnt
smell
artificial
the
body
is
light
and
thin
which
would
be
perfect
for
a
90
degree
day
the
taste
is
way
too
overboard
with
the
lemon
and
a
grainy
character
up
back
this
is
like
a
fruit
beer
and
saison
mixed
together
and
is
decently
refreshing
but
its
not
going
to
hit
the
spot
for
true
beer
enthusiasts
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
pint

looks
like

and
some

on

walls
of
the
glass
taste
is
all
lemon
and
malt
carbonated

tons
of
citrus
flavor
i
can
see
why
this
is
an
attractive
beer
to
some
light
bodied
very
carbonated
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
popular
given
the
fact
that
it
is
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
dont
good
lawnmower
beer
or
beer
to
throw
through
a
lawnmower
this
beer
is
a
great
session
beer
sitting
out
back
or
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
day
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
better
summer
shandys
out
there
i
really
prefer
this
on
a
hot
day
then
my
go

heifer
a
wheat
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
night
is
what
i
look
forward
to
after
a
long
day
at
work
if
you
like
wheat
beers
then
this
is
a
good
one
not
for
everyone
but
for
me
it
just
fine
going
in
to
get
my
third
one
now
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
above
average
overall
it
was
a
decent
beverage
but
not
a
very
good
beer
i
think
id
rather
just
have
an
actual
lemonaid
overall
maybe
these
types
of
beer
are
for
some
but
not
for
me
odbetter
than
expected
i
dont
really
like
lemonade
anyway
so
this
one
never
had
to
chance
to
make
the
word
underrated
slide
across
my
mind
yet
while
trying
to
be
somewhat
objective
this
thing
does
not
suck
nearly
as
bad
as
expected
o
honestly
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
but
still
a
bit
over
the
top
in
terms
of
sweetness
and
not
very
beerlike
either
o
objectively
this
isnt
a
very
good
beer
in
fact
it
doesnt
even
resemble
beer
mikes
hard
lemonade
is
more
beerlike
than
this
this
being
said
i
kinda
enjoy
this
on
its
own
standing
by
itself
without
attaching
a
label
to
it
hot
day
mowing
the
lawn
a
12pk
could
disappear
quickly
just
think
of
it
as
a
refreshing
lemon
drink
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
it
its
not
bad
i
like
it
but
this
isnt
beer
o
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
nor
will
i
drink
it
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
just
feel
like
i
am
taking
medication
rather
than
drinking
a
beer
worth
a
try
just
to
say
you
had
it
othink
leines
could
have
done
something
better
with
this
beerseemingly
took
the
cheap
route
by
making
a
basic
weiss
beeris
it
their
base
beer
that
they
use
to
make
honey
weiss
and
adding
some
lemonade
flavoring
too
much
in
my
opinion
and
this
was
the
result
would
be
interesting
to
make
this
one
with
lemon
juice
or
peel
and
see
what
could
be
done
here
for
a
summer
seasonal
can
see
why
this
would
appeal
to
many
thougheasy
to
drink
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
ill
be
honest
if
im
out
mowing
the
lawn
in
the
90
degree
heat
plus
high
humidity
weather
this
beer
would
taste
pretty
darn
good
going
down
short
of
that
this
beer
didnt
have
the
typical
flavors
of
a
good
unfiltered
wheat
ale
which
it
tries
to
resemble
i
liked
it
better
than
their
sunset
wheat
which
was
too
sweet
and
cereal
tasting
for
my
liking
give
me
my
allagash
white
ale
or
southampton
double
white
ale
for
my
summer
drinking
beer
admittedly
im
a
sucker
for
sweeter
beers
but
even
i
was
skeptical
at
a
lemonadebeer
combo
however
girly
it
may
be
it
is
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
that
manages
to
eliminate
all
of
the
negatives
of
a
malt
beverage
like
mikes
hard
or
a
flavored
beer
like
bud
light
lime
theres
no
lingering
sweetness
and
isnt
harsh
on
the
stomach
acid
wise
you
can
taste
the
beer
and
the
lemonade
but
neither
are
bad
the
flavors
dont
taste
fake
or
forced
great
refreshing
beer
for
a
summer
barbeque
in
a
way
it
is
kind
of
refreshing
low
abv
i
sweated
my
ass
of
in
the
weight
room
tonight
and
this
actually
kind
of
hits
the
spot
for
me
might
grab
one
out
of
a
friends
cooler
on
a
hot
day
or
something
but
not
thinking
ill
be
buying
much
of
this
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
with
a
nice
carbonation
that
goes
with
the
lemon
flavors
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
bit
of
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
i
will
surely
reach
for
it
again
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
after
a
minute
or
two
wheat
on
the
nose
with
a
soapy
lemon
aroma
lemon
flavor
is
predominant
and
definitely
does
not
taste
like
fresh
squeezed
lemonade
but
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
more
like
country
time
lemonade
carbonation
is
pretty
good
all
in
all
it
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
pretty
refreshing
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
but
on
a
105
degree
day
in
phoenix
if
someone
handed
me
one
i
would
certainly
enjoy
it
o
summer
shandy
represents
a
stab
at
the
blue
moonshocktop
market
im
not
sure
how
well
it
compares
to
them
as
i
have
not
sampled
blue
moon
in
many
moons
and
shocktop
has
never
touched
these
lips
in
comparison
to
other
summer
beers
summer
shandy
pales
next
to

still
it
is
marginally
than
sunset
wheat
and
berry
weiss
poured
a
34
white
head
hazy
lemonade
yellow
colored
body
smells
like
lemonade
taste
is
pretty
much
as
to
be
expected
half
weiss
beer
and
half
lemonade
although
there
is
some
lemonade
sweetness
i
dont
personally
think
it
was
even
a
fraction
as
sweet
as
a
typical
off
the
shelf
lemonade
plus
if
it
had
instead
been
predominately
beer
with
just
a
little
lemonade
spike
it
would
be
been
more
like
one
of
those
bmcs
with
lemon
or
lime
twist
so
all
in
all
i
thought
this
delivered
exactly
what
the
label
indicated
and
yes
its
refreshing
the
beer
pours
a
nice
yellow
to
gold
color
had
a
good
head
to
it
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
widmer
brothers
citra
blonde
summer
brew
was
by
far
better
tasting
pours
a
nice
bright
yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fizzes
away
at
a
fair
pace
and
leaves
some
lacing
smells
strongly
of
lemon
and
not
much
else
taste
is
of
carbonated
lemonade
with
some
malts
thrown
in
this
was
a
surprise
to
me
as
i
was
expecting
more
balance
not
that
it
was
a
bad
taste
it
just
threw
me
off
mouthfeel
was
decent
again
like
carbonated
lemonade
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
was
really
refreshing
for
sure
but
its
not
something
i
would
get
again
myself
wow
i
have
to
give
it
props
for
presentation
two
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
above
a
cloudy
bananayellow
colored
beer
it
looked
like
liquid
lemon
meringue
pie
it
smelled
like
it
too
that
or
lemon
pledge
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
a
sugary
lemonade
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
tend
more
towards
tart
andor
dry
but
the
inherent
sweetness
was
not
to
my
liking
finish
was
still
too
sweet
for
me
to
really
get
behind
it
i
am
a
member
of
leinies
lodge
but
i
am
not
putting
this
in
my
canoe
unless
pocahontas
is
coming
along
and
she
would
like
to
drink
it
in
which
case
nah
this
is
just
too
close
to
kiddie
alcopop
for
my
taste
o
i
recognize
that
there
is
potential
for
a
shandy
that
said
the
beer
aspects
are
absent
here
and
the
lemonade
charactersitics
taste
strongly
artificial
thus
this
one
didnt
work
on
almost
any
level
for
me
i
thoroughly
recommend
this
beer
for
summer
afternoons
post
mowing
or
on
the
beach
it
is
perfect
as
a
stepping
stone
to
convert
the
macro
drinkers
or
anybody
new
to
beer
ba
pros
may
enjoy
it
if
they
dont
take
it
too
seriously
o
its
not
offensive
i
just
dont
know
how
to
classify
this
or
even
rate
this
refreshing
non
the
less
overall
though
this
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
a
beer
i
dont
remember
what
mike
hard
lemonade
tastes
like
but
i
imagine
it
tastes
like
this
overall
this
tastes
ok
but
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
as
a
lemonade
it
tastes
pretty
weak
and
as
a
beer
its
almost
nonexistent
o
hey
it
is
what
it
is
a
refreshing
summer
thirst
quencher
would
i
want
more
than
one
or
possibly
two
no
not
really
but
it
gets
the
job
done
and
anyone
that
likes
lemonade
cant
say
this
isnt
good
cause
thats
basically
what
it
is
o
overall
its
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
not
a
complex
or
traditional
beer
but
a
tasty
summer
drink
it
was
a
great
thrist
quencher
summer
brew
very
strong
lemonlime
flavors
prevail
not
exactly
a
beer
drinkers
beer
but
for
a
good
swill
beer
in
the
heat
it
tasted
much
better
that
a
corona
with
lime
in
it
my
report
for
this
beer
isnt
under
my
usual
quality
controlled
enviroment
lazy
boy
chair
in
living
room
with
sam
adams
pint
glass
pourso
this
report
is
more
for
my
database
than
to
be
trusted
as
reliable
by
others
the
body
was
fairly
typical
for
an
american
wheat
ale
medium
and
clean
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
easily
see
having
a
sixer
of
these
while
hanging
out
by
the
nooksack
river
during
the
summer
overall
a
nice
little
beer
worth
your
time
this
was
mediocre
in
my
opinion
it
did
not
taste
enough
like
beer
for
me
i
would
rather
have
a
cold
beer
with
a
slice
of
lemon
lime
or
orange
o
this
is
a
decent
brew
served
ice
cold
on
a
summer
day
i
like
it
while
golfing
right
from
the
can
it
gives
me
the
beer
confidence
i
need
to
sink
6
ft
putts
while
the
4
2
abv
doesnt
turn
me
into
more
of
a
duffer
then
i
already
am
it
is
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
bud
light
lime
d
i
admit
i
like
this
its
great
for
the
summer
i
dont
buy
it
all
the
time
but
its
nice
and
unthreatening
plus
it
it
is
one
of
the
only
shandys
on
the
market
o
i
think
one
needs
familiarity
with
mixed
beer
drinks
to
appreciate
a
shandy
properly
im
admittedly
not
thinking
in
standard
beer
geek
terms
while
enjoying
this
drink
thats
the
bottom
line
really
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
is
it
a
fantastic
shandy
no
its
not
but
for
a
highly
commercialized
version
its
not
half
bad
seeing
how
most
places
will
make
these
to
order
if
youve
never
had
one
i
dont
think
this
should
be
your
introduction
if
you
have
i
think
one
would
be
okay
with
what
is
being
offered
here
onot
impressed
i
can
see
how
a
lot
of
folks
would
go
for
this
in
the
summer
but
for
me
this
beer
seems
to
miss
the
mark
o
the
appearance
surprised
me
wasnt
expecting
the
cloudiness
just
not
a
fan
im
not
a
fruit
beer
guy
to
being
with
and
this
one
just
confirms
yet
again
why
this
was
something
that
you
could
drink
bottle
after
bottle
and
enjoy
each
one
more
and
more
drinkablity
overall
overall
this
beer
is
decent
and
is
pretty
drinkable
i
would
call
it
almost
some
what
of
a
novelty
beer
its
really
a
cross
of
being
like
a
beer
and
fruit
juice
and
being
a
less
sweet
manlier
version
of
like
a
mikes
lemonade
its
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
would
do
quite
well
out
of
a
can
at
the
beach
but
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
often
just
to
chug
sitting
around
the
house
also
a
good
beer
to
bring
to
people
who
dont
really
drink
beer
hazy
yellow
color
glows
in
the
glass
pithy
white
foam
rises
and
crumples
back
to
a
thin
cap
of
bubbles
the
aromas
are
of
lemon
rind
and
cotton
balls
taste
is
very
nice
like
malted
lemonade
light
clean
biscuit
malt
with
a
tangy
lemony
finish
nicely
dry
and
lightmedium
body
very
clean
and
easy
mouthfeel
quaffable
good
summer
pounder
its
a
very
feminine
beer
but
damn
dont
i
enjoy
it
on
a
hot
day
this
one
pours
a
whitish
yellow
color
and
settle
a
lightly
hazed
straw
color
that
resembles
lemon
juice
a
fast
dissipating
inch
of
white
head
is
observed
the
nose
is
very
lemony
and
citrus
infused
lemon
lime
peel
zest
create
the
bouquet
although
quite
tasty
and
citrusy
up
front
the
after
taste
just
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
lemonlime
soft
drink
nothing
too
bold
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
bodied
this
is
the
highlight
of
this
brew
and
certainly
makes
up
for
what
lacks
in
the
taste
considering
how
hot
it
is
outside
great
for
a
hot
day
like
today
this
stuff
is
ok
too
much
emphasis
on
the
lemon
would
make
a
good
summer
session
beer
though
overall
id
buy
this
for
a
hot
afternoon
out
grilling
or
on
the
boat
otherwise
ill
drink
something
else
i
received
this
bottle
from
a
leinenkugel
rep
so
why
not
review
it
it
pours
a
very
very
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
a
soapy
looking
bright
white
head
it
kind
of
looks
like
a
quality
berliner
weiss
the
aromas
consist
of
country
time
lemonade
mix
with
a
light
pale
malt
finish
it
smells
artificial
but
it
is
appealing
on
the
nose
the
flavors
too
are
of
premixed
lemonade
with
a
light
and
dry
malt
finish
there
isnt
any
complexity
but
it
is
what
it
is
its
insanely
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
summertime
option
if
youre
wanting
something
nonbmc
and
with
some
flavor
like
most
of
their
flavored
beers
the
flavors
presented
seem
artificial
so
that
stops
me
from
giving
them
too
much
credit
for
this
tasty
brew
its
a
fine
shandy
o
this
beer
is
not
anything
i
look
for
when
i
go
to
the
store
or
walk
into
a
bar
it
has
a
long
underlying
sweetness
to
it
that
i
find
a
little
too
much
for
me
not
really
sure
i
would
drink
this
one
again
myself
but
if
it
were
to
be
offered
to
me
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
more
of
a
girlie
type
beer
but
seems
to
be
loved
by
the
masses
stateside
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
is
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
brew
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
a
blotch
it
has
an
aroma
of
lemonade
and
beer
breath
lemon
zest
is
detected
its
very
light
bodied
lively
and
gritty
it
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
like
its
covered
in
sand
it
has
a
stale
generic
beer
flavor
with
a
dose
of
lemon
zest
theres
a
little
sweetness
bitterness
and
sourness
this
isnt
pleasant
i
drank
one
of
these
after
mowing
the
lawn
and
it
did
not
quench
my
thirst
this
displeases
me
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
of
a
lemon
yellow
body
the
smell
is
of
fresh
lemons
it
taste
nice
of
lemons
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
crisp
the
beer
overall
i
think
is
good
for
a
nice
summer
beer
taste
tastes
like
someone
dumped
a
can
of
country
time
lemonade
into
a
pint
of
stella
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
a
lot
of
very
sweet
lemon
flavour
summer
shandy
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
it
the
head
settles
and
leave
a
little
lacing
around
the
glass
in
some
areas
the
aroma
has
a
ton
of
lemon
which
is
no
surprise
there
really
isnt
much
getting
past
that
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
again
a
lot
of
lemon
with
just
a
little
bit
of
grainy
malts
in
the
distant
aftertaste
the
mix
of
lemonade
and
beer
for
me
dont
really
mix
too
well
im
just
not
a
big
fan
on
lemons
or
lemonade
for
that
matter
i
can
see
someone
who
enjoys
those
beverages
may
enjoy
this
a
lot
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
light
and
a
decent
choice
for
some
people
in
the
summer
theres
really
very
little
difference
from
bottle
to
can
what
i
do
get
is
a
weaker
head
that
struggles
and
leaves
almost
nothing
behind
in
that
respect
the
main
difference
is
the
appearance
its
a
shandy
so
it
is
what
it
is
its
simply
not
a
wellmade
one
given
that
the
lemon
aspect
overtakes
all
but
the
slightest
inkling
that
this
is
a
beer
its
a
lemon
soda
with
slight
beer
character
shandys
not
a
beer

come
true
but
pick
up
a
stiegl
sp
if
youre
going
to
get
one
otherwise
just
drink
this
as
something
like
chrystal
light
mixed
with
sprite
as
such
perhaps
it
is
pretty
tasty
o
not
a
good
beer
throw
a
slice
of
lemon
in
it
and
i
could
easily
confuse
it
with
crystal
light
with
some
sprite
mixed
in
a
beer
for
people
who
think
they
wont
like
any
beer
the
trouble
is
drinking
this
will
really
turn
you
off
of
beer
ok
give
this
beer
a
break
people
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
it
is
a
summer
shandy
its
a
summertime
beer
it
is
light
crisp
refreshing
and
slightly
sweet
the
smell
is
of
lemon
candy
or
country
time
lemonade
it
taste
like
a
wheat
beer
with
country
time
lemonade
mixed
in
fizzy
citrus
some
sour
tart
lemon
swells
with
the
malt
background
its
a
cloudy
beer
but
it
has
some
creamy
head
and
lace
this
would
hit
the
spot
after
mowing
the
grass
in
the
hot
summer
sun
serve
this
one
cold
it
says
it
is
weiss
beer
with
lemonade
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
taste
like
they
get
an
a
for
nailing
what
they
set
out
to
do
this
should
be
graded
by
its
style
which
is
a
style
of
its
own
and
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
there
are
good
qualities
to
this
beer
it
just
isnt
what
most
beer
drinkers
are
used
to
when
they
think
beer
nothing
complex
or
outstanding
but
very
easy
to
drink
taste
is
uh
weird
lemon
but
not
the
way
im
used
to
usually
its
like
lemon
sour
or
lemon
citrus
hop
feel
but
no
this
is
like
lemon
candy
almost
the
beer
isnt
bitter
yet
has
lemon
as
its
most
defining
characteristic
just
doesnt
come
across
like
beer
or
a
fruit
beer
even
like
a
hotty
tottyboilermaker
type
of
drink
something
with
lemon
and
beer
in
it
but
not
a
lemon
beer
per
se
anyways
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
someone
who
likes
beer
d
damn
near
perfect
i
could
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
all
day
with
its
ultra
light
body
and
low
alcohol
great
fishing
beer
could
also
be
the
one
beer
that
the
girl
who
hates
beer
will
willingly
drink
light
and
breezy
and
cold
and
mindless
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
but
other
than
that
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
for
what
its
worth
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
is
it
great
heavens
no
but
if
its
sunny
youre
outside
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
have
to
quench
that
thirst
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
o
overall
a
pretty
good
light
bodied
easy
drinking
relaxing
summertime
beer
it
isnt
bad
pretty
refreshing
though
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
a
tart
drink
im
glad
it
wasnt
really
sweet
though
im
not
sure
how
often
id
drink
this
if
i
had
a
lot
of
good
craft
available
because
there
are
other
summer
seasonals
which
i
generally
enjoy
more
than
this
i
do
not
give
a
schlitz
for
summer
shandy
i
do
not
give
a
snapple
for
summer
shandy
and
just
to
be
clear
i
do
not
give
a
lemon
scented
pine
sol
for
summer
shandy
mo
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
overall
sweet
has
wonderful
carbonation
that
cleans
everything
away
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
summer
drinker
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
and
my
personal
favorite
for
taking
with
me
to
play
some
disc
golf
i
often
go
with
oberon
but
this
beer
is
lighter
and
more
refreshing
then
oberon
and
i
like
that
better
for
playing
disc
golf
this
beer
is
exactly
what
its
name
implies
a
shandy
and
thats
how
i
grade
this
beer
not
as
a
typical
fruit
beer
this
is
the
only
commercially
available
shandy
i
have
seen
most
of
the
time
shandys
are
dyi
recipes
so
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
already
mixed
and
the
fact
it
comes
in
cans
helps
also
i
tend
to
keep
this
in
my
fridge
all
summer
for
those
afternoon
disc
golf
games
they
are
nice
and
refreshing
and
dont
get
you
too
buzzed
it
just
has
great
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lighter
refreshing
beer
for
those
active
summer
days
then
this
beer
will
work
well
overall
i
didnt
realize
this
was
only
4
2
percent
until
i
got
it
home
i
never
buy
below
5
just
cause
i
want
a
real
beer
and
not
lite
beer
i
liked
the
other
3
beers
i
had
by
this
company
last
summer
one
was
blueberry
i
believe
and
another
wheat
cant
remember
exactly
summer
shandy
is
something
you
could
drink
all
day
if
it
was
sold
cheaply
enough
or
was
free
im
not
gonna
but
it
again
because
at
7
its
a
bit
expensive
for
the
abv
and
falling
into
the
joke
beer
category
such
as
being
a
lemonade
d
i
can
only
imagine
enjoying
this
on
a
hot
day
leading
up
to
something
else
the
glassware
is
the
best
part
figured
since
it
was
a
featured
brew
and
one
i
havent
had
at
quizzo
yet
id
take
it
down
tonight
it
pours
a
hazy
white
grapefruit
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
wheat
and
what
could
theoretically
be
construed
as
coriander
all
of
these
elements
come
through
very
meekly
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemonade
grapefruit
juice
lemon
peel
and
slightly
funky
wheat
it
all
comes
across
as
something
akin
to
a
crappy
bottle
of
squirt
or
something
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
grainyish
feel
overall
i
can
easily
say
that
i
would
not
go
for
this
one
particularly
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
just
perfectly
carbonated
and
has
the
right
thickness
to
be
refreshing
the
drinkabilitiy
of
course
is
phenomenal
may
as
well
be
drinking
lemonades
i
know
a
lot
of
elitists
will
hate
on
this
but
i
enjoy
this
brew
its
just
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
great
in
the
florida
sun
thin
feel
some
carbonation
separates
it
from
unsweetened
lemonade
glad
it
was
free
o
i
could
see
how
this
could
appeal
to
some
it
would
be
good
for
drinkers
looking
to
move
from
standard
macros
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
one
or
two
on
a
hot
summer
day
excellent
summer
beer
hint
of
lemonade
and
orange
flavor
with
hoppy

not
a
beer
for
the
winter
but
the
hot
90
summer
days
there
is
not
much
betterit
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
color
is

i
would

they

last

at

outing
i
could
only
drink
one
too
sweet
zesty
and
fizzy
for
a
hot
day
upsets
the
stomach
a
little
taste
sounds
drinks
and
feels
like
a
soda
pop
sorry
leines
this
is
your
worst
beer
during
summer
this
would
be
a
drink
of
choice
when
im
looking
for
something
fruity
during
the
winter
i
mostly
take
it
out
of
my
reserves
to
rebel
against
winter
as
for
being
a
beer
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
still
great
as
its
own
drink
d
love
this
beer
i
know
it
may
not
be
considered
a
beer
by
some
but
dang
this
is
soo
good
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
and
the
smell
was
fine
bit
of
fruitiness
smell
and
tiny
bit
of
grain
taste
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
fantastic
during
the
summer
months
drinkability
is
fair
wouldnt
be
my
choice
to
pound
these
one
night
would
rather
go
for
some
rolling
rock
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
as
i
grow
older
i
find
myself
more
drawn
to
the
hoppy
citrus
flavors
than
the
straight
lemonade
approach
a
hands
down
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
is
getting
such
bad
reviews
from
other
users
here
is
the
way
i
look
at
the
shandy
it
is
not
a
beer
per
say
but
a
delicious
flavored
beverage
that
goes
handinhand
with
hot
summer
days
laying
on
the
beach
going
out
on
the
boat
or
sitting
around
a
bonfire
on
the
back
deck
on
a
late
july
night
now
if
i
am
looking
for
an
actual
beer
but
not
worth
buying

this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
drinkablity
is
in
regards
to
the
total
ability
to
drink
it
often
and
quickly
but
it
really
depends
on
the
crowd
and
what
youre
in
the
mood
for

unless

had

hankering
for

far
as

goes

these
up
anytime

was
actually
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
still
not
very
good
pale
cloudy
big
white
head
not
bad
smells
like
lemons
and
nothing
else
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
but
lemons
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
to
begin
with
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
however
overall
i
would
have
to
say
it
still
beats
a
bud
light
this
beer
fits
the
woman
beer
category
with
the
low
alcohol
factor
and
the
watery
taste
i
guess
it
would
be
a
decent
starter
beer
to
get
the
ol
gf
or
wife
slowly
into
the
field
of
better
beers
drinkability
while
im
not
opposed
to
the
idea
of
beer
blended
with
lemonade
this
just
has
a
repellent
artificial
quality
to
it
less
summer
shandy
and
more
of
a
summer
shitty
wait
am
i
allowed
to
say
that
lets
face
it
this
is
not
a
hardcore
big
character
beer
but
at
4
2abv
on
a
super
hot
day
you
cant
go
wrong
with
the
refreshment
aspect
and
sessionability
of
this
beer
pairs
well
with
extreme
humidity
and
thirst
grabbed
this
in
an
attempt
to
find
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
a
cloudy
yellow
color
looks
like
the
typical
hefeweizen
the
off
white
head
quickly
dispersed
the
lemon
smell
over
powers
any
typical
beer
smell
and
the
taste
is
almost
like
drinking
lemonade
its
crisp
lemony
taste
is
easy
to
drink
and
if
you
like
lemons
youll
like
the
beer
overall
it
taste
like
the
typical
hefewizen
with
four
or
five
lemon
slices
squeezed
into
it
decent
offering
for
a
hot
summer
day
leinie
seems
to
be
going
for
the
teenage
girl
drinkers
or
women
who
dont
really
like
beer
well
carbonated
and
light
bodied
which
was
good
because
it
helped
get
this
beer
down
overall
i
drank
the
pint
but
it
sucked
lemon
soda
with
a
beer
in
there
somewhere
avoid
this
pair
with
spicy
food
or
a
lawnmower
and
youll
be
fine
pours
a
very
cloudy
yellow
color
pretty
good
to
hear
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
as
the
beer
goes
down
smell
is
of
a
fresh
made
glass
of
lemonade
nice
smell
but
reminds
me
way
too
much
a
german
radler
had
radler
brau
by
clipper
city
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
taste
is
very
much
radler
like
disappointingly
very
dry
in
the
mouth
and
in
the
finish
lemonade
taste
is
just
way
too
present
here
leaves
your
mouth
more
thirsty
after
you
finish
this
beer
than
before
you
started
never
a
good
thing
for
a
beer
on
the
plus
side
it
is
leaps
and
bounds
ahead
of
the
paper
city
beer
of
a
similar
style
but
definitely
nothing
id
ever
seek
out
again
and
would
probably
turn
down
one
if
offered
stick
with
the
sunset
wheat
overall
not
bad
i
drank
all
3
from
the
sampler
while
the
other
two
berry
weiss
lie
in
wait
for
some
sucker
to
try
notes
would
really
consided
this
a
true
beer
per
say
would
be
a
good
choice
to
enjoy
with
a
coed
group
of
friends
out
in
the
sun
overall
it
is
not
an
offensive
drink
it
is
still
refreshing
and
tasty
but
it
doesnt
give
me
the
feeling
of
beer
i
am
pretty
impressed
with
this
company
for
doing
something
a
little
differerent
i
am
never
a
fan
of
flavored
beer
myself
but
out
of
all
the
ones
i
have
tried
this
is
probably
the
best
one
d
rather
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
good
beach
beer
should
come
in
cans
drinkability
its
ok
not
that
drinkable
because
i
dont
care
for
the
taste
give
me
gumballhead
anyday
over
this
dr
lets
just
say
im
sorry
i
bought
a
sixpack
instead
of
a
single
if
you
like
the
flavor
it
would
go
down
very
easily
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
little
head
and
good
lacing
to
follow
the
overall
smell
is
of
lemons
with
some
wheat
beer
characteristics
the
overall
taste
is
lemonade
the
lemonade
however
isnt
over
powering
like
the
berry
weis
is
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
not
overly
carbonated
the
overall
drinkability
is
very
high
you
could
have
about
12
of
these
without
knowing
very
refreshing
d
i
find
this
beer
to
taste
more
like
a
bitch
drinkexcuse
the
language
however
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
on
a
weekend
like
the
4th
of
july
i
might
end
up
with
several
in
my
belly
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
the
store
to
buy
more
though
d
wasnt
a
real
fan
i
got
a
little
too
much
fake
lemonade
flavoring
out
of
it
probably
wouldnt
have
another
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
slightly
more
lemony
than
i
prefer
but
its
not
to
bad
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
its
perfect
note
this
is
a
really
good
beverage
but
it
is
a
little
hard
to
consider
it
wheat
beer
because
there
is
very
little
wheat
beer
flavors
fruity
but
lacks
the
variety
of
fruit
flavors
but
i
have
never
actually
made
a
shandy
before
but
i
feel
this
would
be
a
good
representation
of
it
very
refreshing
drinkability
this
would
make
for
a
last
minute
end
of
a
hot
summer
day
session
beer
nothing
really
great
about
it
other
than
the
lemon
flavor
if
that
is
what
you
find
to
be
really
refreshing
theres
better
summer
beers
out
there
pours
bright
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
smells
like
lemonade
i
dont
have
the
greatest
sense
of
smell
but
ill
be
damned
if
anyone
else
can
smell
anything
but
lemonade
in
this
i
like
lemonade
but
i
dont
want
my
beer
to
necessarily
smell
like
that
and
only
that
the
lemon
flavors
are
real
and
pleasant
this
kind
of
beer
could
easily
go
the
way
of
bud
light
lime
where
it
tastes
like
candy
and
not
like
fruit
but
it
doesnt
i
still
have
a
hard
time
picking
out
the
beer
flavors
from
it
near
as
i
can
tell
the
wheat
beer
this
is
based
on
only
contributes
a
foamy
head
and
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
clearly
this
would
be
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
if
i
wanted
beer
i
would
reach
for
something
else
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
as
a
summer
beer
this
would
be
decent
if
it
werent
for
the
dumping
of
lemonade
into
the
beer
d
theres
nothing
special
to
distinguish
this
i
could
mix
stale
bud
light
and
lemonade
at
home
and
it
would
save
me
the
trip
to
the
store
to
get
this
overall
very
unimpressive
from
the
company
that
makes
sunset
wheat
the
nonalcoholic
shandy
i
had
in
the
uk
even
tastes
much
more
flavorful
than
this
overall
this
is
a
supremely
inoffensive
beer
and
probably
best
serves
as
a
gateway
from
a
bmconly
world
if
you
want
to
drink
a
shandyradler
make
your
own
but
this
isnt
a
bad
alternative
when
that
isnt
an
option
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
small
white
head
after
i
finished
mowing
the
lawn
it
was
a
cloudy
yellow
color
it
smelled
lemony
it
tasted
like
blue
moon
infused
with
lemonade
i
guess
if
youre
going
to
garnish
wheats
with
friut
you
may
as
well
do
it
during
the
brewing
process
i
thought
it
was
very
good
and
i
apologize
for
the
blue
moon
reference
not
a
fan
the
summer
shandy
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
after
some
yard
work
it
is
a
very
nice
summer
session
ber
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
poured
a
hazy
lemon
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
all
lemons
and
that
was
a
good
thing
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
very
disapointing
the
lemonade
slightly
overpowered
the
beer
bringing
out
the
worst
characteristics
of
two
beverages
i
enjoy
it
was
way
too
sweet
and
there
was
no
beer
flavor
in
this
one
almost
like
a
malternative
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
way
overcarbonated
imo
it
is
almost
sickenly
sweet
and
i
had
trouble
drinking
it
avoid
good
drinkability
but
almost
kind
of
off
the
mark
of
a
beer
i
hate
to
compare
to
bud
light
lime
cuz
its
not
quite
on
that
level
however
its
not
quite
enough
to
give
it
praise
caught
in
between
nikki
very
drinkable
in
the
way
that
juice
is
drinkable
not
drinkable
like
how
beer
is
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
veerrrry
light
almost
nonexistent
but
overall
goes
down
easy
highly
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
great
summer
beer
i
thought
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
took
top
honors
out
of
this
brewery
but
summer
shandy
is
a
close
second
when
it
comes
to
having
a
refreshing
lighter
beer
drinkability
again
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
i
believe
you
could
drink
one
after
another
at
4
2
and
with
the
slickness
with
which
it
goes
it
is
very
drinkable
not
for
everyone
and
probably
not
for
purists
but
as
a
fun
recreational
drink
i
think
leines
got
what
they
were
going
for
would
defintely
have
again
its
a
pretty
opaque
gold
color
with
almost
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
the
aroma
has
some
lemon
zest
not
overpowering
like
some
bad
fruit
beers
ive
tried
its
suttle
and
pleasant
taste
wise
its
rather
pleasant
like
a
bit
of
lemonade
was
added
body
wise
its
about
average
for
a
wheat
beer
id
have
this
one
again
this
review
will
be
on
the
products
merits
as
a
beer
but
as
a
beverage
in
general
as
a
beer
this
fails
it
is
extremely
light
with
few
taste
characteristics
of
beer
however
it
is
not
at
all
bad
it
more
resembles
a
mellow
less
sweet
lemonade
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
fruity
with
some
nice
sweetness
at
first
and
then
a
more
bitterhoppy
finish
that
balances
nice
quite
refreshing
and
not
at
all
bad
for
a
hot
summer
day
which
is
exactly
how
i
am
enjoying
it
worth
trying
for
this
purpose
not
worth
trying
if
looking
for
a
great
beer
though
d
personally
i
think
its
good
for
what
it
is
lemonade
beer
m
d
sharp
carbonation
giving
it
some
nice
character
prickly
but
its
rather
fine
so
it
comes
across
as
being
a
bit
smoother
light
on
the
alcohol
makes
for
easy
drinking
but
i
couldnt
really
see
it
as
being
any
sort
of
session
offering
its
just
a
bit
too
sweet
in
that
sense
and
is
like
quaffing
back
a
lot
of
lemonade
drinkabilitymy
own
personal
rank
for
this
beer
is
higherprobably
a
b
but
i
do
not
think
it
meets
the
style
guidelines
well
i
think
this
is
great
for
a
shandy
but
not
as
a
wheat
ale
i
would
have
several
of
these
as
a
summer
refresher
but
maybe
not
the
first
thing
i
look
for
if
i
want
a
beer
the
lemon
is
very
strong
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
powdered
county
time
lemonade
before
it
is
mixed
with
water
there
is
absolutely
no
beeriness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
isnt
quite
so
processed
lemonade
like
but
there
still
is
nothing
beer
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
beer
simply
isnt
for
me
the
only
flavored
beer
ive
tried
that
i
think
is
fair
to
compare
it
to
is
bud
light
lime
and
if
forced
to
drink
one
i
would
choose
the
bud
light
lime
d
fairly
drinkable
on
very
warm
days
out
in
the
sun
quite
sweet
and
probably
hard
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
but
not
a
bad
offering
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
thick
fluffy
head
smells
like
lemons
with
a
little
bit
of
wheat
beer
mixed
in
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
lemonade
all
the
way
through
until
the
end
where
you
can
detect
a
wheat
beer
and
citrus
bitterness
a
lemon
overload
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
do
like
lemons
so
it
is
definitely
drinkable
but
on
a
summer
day
i
would
prefer
a
hefe
or
something
slightly
less
acidic
and
citrus
tasting
drinkability
is
probably
subpar
for
a
summer
sessionable
beer
its
light
in
terms
of
stomach
substance
but
heavy
on
tongue
cheek
and
overall
mouth
sensations
though
interesting
and
worthy
of
another
sip
id
pass
on
two
consecutive
just
about
every
time
d
not
sure
i
could
say
this
is
very
drinkable
i
suppose
i
could
see
having
one
of
these
on
a
hot
afternoon
but
definitely
not
something
i
would
ever
order
at
a
bar
overall
i
think
this
beer
has
potential
to
be
a
great
summer
session
or
cookout
beer
but
youll
have
to
find
the
right
foods
to
bring
out
the
taste
or
make
sure
you
arent
eating
anything
at
all
otherwise
it
starts
to
feel
like
drinking
beer
with
water
in
it
instead
of
lemonade
remember
the
prefacing
statement
if
not
see
above
when
all
else
fails
a
copout
3s
all
around
this
thing
is
really
drinkable
it
definitely
shines
in
this
part
of
the
rating
light
not
bad
tasting
and
pretty
refreshing
i
could
down
these
pretty
quickly
a
decent
summer
brew
for
a
hot
day
this
seasonal
is
a
good
treat
for
a
hot
afternoon
after
of
mowing
the
lawn
this
beer
is
a
bit
like
gatorade
the
more
hot
and
thirsty
you
are
the
better
it
tastes
this
beer
is
a
seasonal
because
one
is
not
usually
overheating
in
the
winter
the
smell
of
lemon
does
not
overwhelm
the
maltiness
of
the
beer
it
pours
a
bright
sunshine
yellow
which
foreshadows
the
presence
of
lemon
the
tase
is
a
pleasant
balance
of
lemon
and
malt
that
surprised
me
i
was
sure
this
would
be
some
cheap
hard
lemonade
concoction
but
it
wasnt
it
was
balanced
and
fun
to
drink
pours
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
with
a
very
lager
like
white
head
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
lemonade
and
a
bit
grassy
very
light
mouthfeel
wellbalanced
but
thin
and
fairly
bland
wheat
is
present
in
the
aftertaste
the
finish
is
acidic
a
little
too
much
lemonade
and
not
enough
beer
to
back
it
up
on
a
sidenote
i
wonder
if
the
beer
the
lemonade
is
blended
with
is
leinenkugels
original
or
something
different
d
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
for
the
style
but
the
taste
could
use
a
little
work
the
sweet
lemons
got
to
me
later
on
and
the
matliness
of
the
beer
was
way
overpowered
by
the
lemon
taste
mouthfeel
carbonated
reminds
me
of
a
wine
cooler
or
sparkling
wine
this
reminds
of
the
a
malt
based
wine
cooler
rather
than
a
beer
in
pa
malt
coolers
are
solid
at
beer
distributors
while
wine
based
coolers
are
sold
at
the
state
stores
at
least
that
was
the
case
back
in
the
mid
80s
when
these
types
of
drinsks
were
popular
i
try
never
to
refuse
a
beer
but
i
dont
think
this
was
a
beer
i
gave
it
to
my
wife
and
she
enjoyed
it
perfect
for
a
picnic
or
an
outdoor
ball
game
its
a
shame
leinies
doesnt
make
this
year
round
i
could
use
some
to
fend
off
these
cold
minnesotan
winters
serving
type
bottle
d
ive
made
my
own
radlers
by
mixing
home
made
lemonade
with
a
good
german
beer
but
this
is
undrinkable
for
me
taste
toasted
malt
hints
of
lemon
but
it
is
kinda
balanced
there
was
a
slight
bit
of
tartness
in
finish
but
overall
a
nice
clean
and
easy
beer
to
drink
i
think
samuel
adams
has
a
little
bit
better
summer
beer
d
not
a
great
taste
so
i
wouldnt
drink
many
of
these
the
citrus
is
too
overpowering
to
have
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
not
sure
who
this
beer
would
appeal
to
as
even
the
women
at
our
table
thought
it
tasted
too
cheesy
before
i
drink
this
again
ill
have
a
straight
lemonade
or
real
beer
not
this
tweener
this
sounded
good
on
paper
lemonade
meet
a
wheat
beer
well
if
they
had
used
a
decent
lemonade
and
a
mediocre
wheat
beer
then
maybe
they
would
have
had
something
all
this
is
is
a
sickly
sweet
mess
on
top
of
a
less
than
mediocre
wheat
beer
yuck
this
is
a
very
surprisingly
good
beer
that
everyone
you
know
will
like
even
those
damn
snobby
american
guinness
stout
drinkers
plus
you
dont
get
called
names
for
drinking
this
when
you
really
want
a
cheer
beer
it
even
has
a
twist
off
cap
this
beer
definitely
stands
out
it
kicks
ass
at
the
fruit
combination
thing
that
so
many
other
beers
fail
at
this
beer
really
changed
my
view
on
leinenkugel
as
a
brewery
though
i
dont
know
if
my
dismissal
of
them
was
due
to
me
actually
having
and
disliking
one
of
their
beers
or
if
i
just
really
hated
their
logo
and
fonts
and
everything
else
about
their
design
the
whole
package
looks
like
it
could
be
found
at
a
crappy
gift
shop
at
the
cherokee
indian
reserve
even
so
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
whenever
the
weather
starts
to
warm
up
a
little
bit
utterly
a
wreck
this
one
ended
in
a
drain
pour
which
i
seriously
hate
to
do
this
may
actually
only
be
like
my
second
drain
pour
it
was
just
that
bad
in
the
future
i
would
not
make
this
mistake
again
if
you
like
lemonade
go
for
it
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
radlershandy
i
would
rather
mix
lemonade
with
a
lager
of
my
choosing
d
ample
taste
with
the
lemony
kick
goes
down
pretty
easy
be
ready
for
something
thats
not
very
beerlike
having
never
tried
a
shandy
before
i
was
very
apprehensive
beer
with
lemonade
sounded
disgusting
to
me
i
was
mistaken
this
hazy
whitegolden
colored
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
the
sweetness
and
well
lemonade
flavor
make
it
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
d3
5
i
like
this
for
what
it
is
as
a
light
lemon
summer
type
beer
something
different
to
try
if
you
are
in
a
lemon
beer
mood
whatever
that
means
i
got
this
stuff
for
3
99
a
sixer
in
late
summer
so
i
drank
it
with
a
smile
on
a
hot
day
3
0
since
it
is
a
shandy
not
a
pale
wheat
ale
this
is
confusing
d
this
stuff
couldnt
be
much
easier
to
put
back
its
very
unoffensive
but
the
problem
is
none
of
the
flavors
are
strong
enough
everything
about
the
beer
is
weak
and
all
i
can
take
away
is
a
vague
lemon
flavor
over
a
weird
lightbeer
graininess
this
is
not
my
type
of
beer
but
then
again
i
guess
i
have
never
had
anything
like
this
before
so
props
for
that
and
trying
something
new
give
it
a
try
easy
to
drink
decent
beer
for
after
a
hard
day
of
work
or
maybe
out
at
the
pool
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
refreshment
than
a
beer
somewhat
like
lemonade
not
bad
though
very
good
beer
after
a
hard
days
work
d
my
stomach
couldnt
handle
even
half
a
bottle
of
this
this
is
a
weird
one
from
leinenkugel
the
makers
of
weird
beer
lemonaid
and
beer
mixed
together
sounds
gross
right
well
its
better
then
i
expected
it
to
be
not
great
though
aperently
this
style
of
lemonaid
beer
is
biger
in
england
and
parts
of
europe
but
it
is
the
only
one
i
have
seen
in
the
u
s
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
light
and
taste
like
lemonaid
beer
neither
flavor
is
overpowering
which
is
what
i
had
expected
it
to
be
like
i
cant
say
i
could
drink
alot
of
them
but
every
once
and
a
while
it
would
be
ok
to
have
a
few
you
have
to
try
this
one
for
your
self
to
really
understand
the
flavor
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
refreshing
for
what
you
get
it
isnt
all
that
bad
just
not
something
you
would
drink
if
you
wanted
a
beer
of
substance
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
the
lemon
flavor
is
so
strong
and
sweet
that
this
beer
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
malternative
beverage
that
ive
seen
while
still
technically
being
a
beer
well
im
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
one
a
shandy
is
lager
and
lemonade
mixed
and
thats
what
this
tastes
like
the
lemonade
might
not
be
the
best
it
tastes
like
powdered
mix
and
id
like
to
see
a
hint
more
acidity
but
i
can
hardly
fault
it
its
cloudy
like
lemonade
and
actually
has
pretty
good
lacing
it
smells
like
lemonade
when
you
raise
the
glass
to
your
nose
and
it
tastes
like
lemonade
mixed
with
beer
and
its
not
overly
sweet
or
overly
bitter
or
overly
acidic
so
overall
its
fairly
well
done
and
nicely
balanced
i
enjoyed
it
and
id
have
another
if
i
was
at
a
bbq
or
other
warmweather
outdoor
event
unoffensive
its
a
summertime
drink
that
the
ladies
would
like
and
that
wont
hurt
every
now
and
then
not
really
a
pure
beer
though
the
lemonade
part
is
for
real
do
not
waste
your
time
soft
hazy
swiftly
effervescent
orangelemon
body
with
a
sudsy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
line
in
a
tumbler
lemon
zest
aromanot
to
the
point
of
dawn
but
close
without
a
scent
of

or
hop
soft
zesty
swift
bubbles

tongue
no
impact
early
but
a
burst
of
champagne
bubbles
blast
late
results
in
a
pleasantly
drinkable
beer
lemonade
indeednot
sure
if
this
qualifies
as
a
fruit
beer
or
a
cheap
gimmick
most
on
this
website
seem
to
think
the
latter
a
bit
of
malt
at
the
finish
attempts
to
fortify
with
a
backbone
admittance
i
like
the
alliterative
name
of
this
beerwho
doesnt
feel
another
era
awaken
with
the
word
shandyand
of
all
the
leinenkugel
weisse
assortment
this
is
the
most
pleasant
to
drink
and
the
most
thoughtless
to
enjoy
i
e
it
does
what
it
set
out
to
do
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
would
make
a
good
session
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
designed
for
maximum
drink
ability
at
4
2
abv
would
like
a
little
more
flavor
had
this
at
a
buddys
house
as
a
leftover
i
was
expecting
worse
but
still
think
i
would
pass
on
purchasing
this
one
d
not
my
type
of
brew
interesting
and
different
but
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
i
personally
think
that
lemonade
and
beer
shouldnt
be
mixed
but
i
know
of
some
friends
that
think
the
shandy
is
a
great
idea
this
wasnt
too
drinkable
for
me
thinner
feeling
than
a
wheat
but
easy
to
drink
gets
a
bit
too
sweet
eventually
well
suited
for
the
season
on
the
label
d
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
beer
before
tasting
i
might
mistake
it
for
something
else
that
said
these
are
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
playing
golf
etc
and
when
appreciated
for
what
it
is
can
definitely
be
enjoyed
this
beer
will
remain
in
my
fridge
until
they
stop
making
it
unfortunatley
i
was
not
as
impressed
with
the
beer
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
sixer
the
beer
pours
an
odd
yellow
maybe
a
little
too
yellow
the
smell
is
pleasing
to
the
nose
but
it
smells
more
of
lemons
than
it
does
of
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
you
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
lemon
but
also
the
slight
bitterness
of
the
wheat
its
the
aftertaste
that
threw
me
as
the
more
i
drank
the
stronger
the
sweet
aftertaste
lasted
in
the
end
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
on
a
hot
day
but
it
is
not
a
great
drinking
session
beer
but
surprisingly
both
my
neighbors
and
i
agreed
it
was
very
drinkable
in
the
end
suffice
it
to
say
that
this
is
not
the
highest
testament
to
the
art
of
brewing
one
will
find
in
stores
this
summer
but
its
an
interesting
attempt
and
a
quite
acceptable
offering
for
a
hot
night
out
on
the
dec
the
concept
is
fine
but
this
is
hardly
a
shandy
regardless
this
will
be
suited
to
the
people
who
like
lemonade
from
a
powder
mix
with
just
a
tad
of
undetectable
alcohol
too
sweet
in
an
artificial
way
for
me
though
lemonade
dryness
almost
makes
up
for
it
almost
after
what
ive
just
said
about
it
im
surprised
to
say
that
i
still
find
this
to
be
a
good
easydrinking
refreshing
summer
brew
on
a
nice
hot
day
this
would
definitely
do
the
trick
overall
this
was
a
bit
much
the
label
says
weiss
beer
with
lemon
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
something
refreshing
well
the
lemon
was
there
but
i
never
did
find
the
weiss
beer
part
it
was
light
and
ctirusy
cool
but
left
me
feeling
more
like
i
was
holding
a
clear
malt
beverage
than
a
beer
too
much
lemon
and
way
to
sweet
to
even
think
about
drinking
more
than
one
without
getting
a
stomachache
interesting
but
more
lemonade
than
beer
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
as
were
my
expectations
now
the
first
gulp
felt
thick
and
creamy
it
looked
like
it
was
going
to
save
the
day
for
me
but
it
only
stayed
that
way
for
a
little
bit
it
decides
to
turn
watery
making
me
cry
inside
in
the
end
this
beer
felt
like
a
good
story
gone
wrong
it
made
me
want
it
until
i
had
it
the
only
way
i
can
truly
describe
it
is
if
mary
shelly
decide
to
brew
beer
waited
for
it
and
at
that
moment
she
tasted
it
she
had
an
epiphany
and
came
up
with
the
story
of
frankenstein
but
not
the
story
we
know
and
love
today
no
the
first
draft
the
draft
of
a
story
that
when
finished
looks
awesome
and
feels
awesome
but
when
you
come
back
later
and
reread
it
you
realize
how
much
it
could
have
been
better
so
you
edit
and
reedit
it
until
you
get
a
great
story
that
is
what
this
needs
it
needs
an
edit
an
edit
to
finish
what
should
be
a
great
story
kudos
to
leinies
for
bringing
an
unique
beer
flavor
to
the
market
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
little
nostolgia
while
listening
to
paul
simons
graceland
album
leinenkugel
summer
shandy
tastes
quite
a
bit
like
lemonade
a
quality
that
would
normally
convince
me
to
lower
my
rating
but
there
are
some
qualities
that
make
leinenkugel
summer
shandy
different
from
many
other
fruit
beers
and
make
it
more
enjoyable
first
the
fruit
is
not
syrupy
or
excessively
sweet
the
taste
of
lemon
is
obvious
but
this
beer
doesnt
taste
like
kool
aid
or
any
other
sugary
drink
second
it
still
has
characteristics
of
beer
even
though
the
lemon
taste
dominates
its
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
and
it
does
make
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
aroma
is
countrytime
lemonade
mix
not
the
drink
the
powder
very
acidic
pours
an
odd
shade
of
milky
yellow
with
a
billowing
cream
head
that
lasts
throughout
leaving
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
i
cannot
taste
any
beer
in
this
its
all
lemonade
very
acidic
and
harsh
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
in
conjunction
with
the
lemonade
makes
it
more
like
a
soda
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
with
this
but
just
went
overboard
on
the
lemonade
if
it
was
a
more
natural
lemon
flavor
it
would
probably
be
pretty
good
but
this
tastes
very
artificial
great
summer
beer
but
only
in
small
quantities
as
described
it
is
very
lemony
you
get
a
lot
more
lemon
than
beer
but
still
a
great
combination
for
the
summer
the
wheat
off
sets
it
enough
to
let
the
title
of
beer
remain
hey
if
you
like
lemonade
and
beer
give
this
a
try
i
also
recommend
pouring
this
in
a
glass
and
adding
a
real
lemon
wedge
and
circling
the
rim
of
the
glass
then
putting
it
right
in
the
beer
oddly
enough
its
actually
very
drinkable
and
once
i
finished
mine
i
was
actually
thinking
about
grabbing
another
just
to
follow
it
up
with
id
probably
buy
a
sixer
every
summer
just
for
the
odd
taste
combination
until
someone
managed
to
do
a
better
lemonadebeer
combination
well
it
come
in
a
12
oz
brown
longneck
so
i
guess
its
beer
but
you
could
toss
this
one
back
like
it
was
umm
lemonade
i
would
have
drunk
this
when
i
was
a
teen
who
liked
the
idea
of
drinking
beer
but
not
the
beer
taste
did
i
mention
its
really
lemony
like
if
you
drank
one
immediately
after
reading
this
youd
think
wow
that
was
more
lemony
than
i
had
expected
lemony
is
a
nice
word
try
working
it
into
a
sentence
today
not
sure
where
they
are
going
with
this
one
i
wanted
a
beer
not
a
mikes
ripoff
d
not
to
bad
not
awesome
the
lemonade
and
citrus
go
well
together
but
the
lemonade
was
a
little
strong
and
distracted
from
the
flavor
of
the
wheat
beer
a
little
overpowering
my
review
makes
it
sound
worse
than
it
probably
is
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
it
would
probably
hit
the
spot
any
other
time
and
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
one
this
isnt
my
style
but
if
offered
id
drink
it
again
perfect
for
someone
who
wants
to
have
a
real
beer
instead
of
random
persons
hard
lemonade
malt
beverage
d
in
short
i
like
this
much
better
then
leinenekugers
ill
fated
berry
weiser
this
one
still
tastes
like
beer
the
lemonadelemon
flavor
introduced
is
natural
and
not
sickly
sweet
i
see
people
comparing
this
to
mikes
hard
lemonade
but
i
think
thats
a
complete
stretch
this
is
just
a
decent
wietbier
with
some
lemon
flavors
added
to
it
which
complements
it
well
huge
white
fluffy
head
in
a
frosted
mug
with
a
fair
lacing
over
a
murky
golden
tan
colored
brew
the
lemon
is
easily
detected
in
the
aroma
to
the
extent
that
its
pretty
hard
to
pick
up
much
else
almost
lemonlime
if
your
not
use
to
this
mixture
its
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
you
can
adjust
to
it
if
youre
open
minded
tastes
sort
of
like
a
mellow
lemon
cake
with
modest
sweetness
its
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
and
i
would
say
it
grows
on
you
depending
on
your
expectations
i
probably
could
enjoy
these
if
i
just
think
more
lemonade
than
beer
not
often
such
a
desirable
option
but
i
can
handle
it
once
in
a
great
while
i
can
only
picture
drinking
this
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
not
typically
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
still
like
it
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
very
light
so
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
but
again
it
will
just
tick
you
off
if
you
think
it
will
taste
anything
like
a
maltybitter
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
is
a
refreshing
lemonade
type
beverage
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
1
and
a
half
fingers
of
foamy
white
head
that
has
average
retention
and
some
good
lacing
smells
of
lemonade
wheat
and
lemon
candy
tastes
of
sweet
lemonade
at
first
with
some
wheaty
bread
coming
in
behind
the
lemon
sweetness
finishes
with
a
little
extra
punch
of
lemon
zest
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
really
sweet
and
lemon
filled
refreshing
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
good
on
those
hot
summer
days
but
a
little
too
much
like
lemonade
not
enough
like
beer
for
me
to
want
to
session
wouldnt
mind
having
one
after
mowing
the
grass
though
d
i
put
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
have
another
it
is
an
interesting
idea
but
i
was
happy
with
the
beer
i
like
their
honey
weiss
though
drinkability
isnt
bad
at
all
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
stuff
can
certainly
fix
the
thirst
for
a
while
and
its
a
good
warm
up
beer
for
those
who
havent
had
much
beer
before
its
a
good
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
more
like
a
glorified
lemonade
why
not
summers
here
a
very
simple
yet
good
beer
my
wife
liked
it
a
lot
and
it
was
on
tap
so
i
had
some
and
it
wasnt
bad
next
time
im
laying
on
the
beach
this
might
hit
the
spot
notes
overall
its
a
refreshing
summery
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
although
it
leans
more
towards
a
mikes
hard
lemonade
malt
beverage
than
beer
this
is
alright
i
wont
go
searching
for
it
but
i
can
see
that
there
could
a
an
appeal
for
some
not
necessarily
immersed
in
the
hard
core
brew
scene
in
the
end
the
lemon
is
too
strong
for
my
taste
and
a
more
lightly
balanced
drink
would
have
been
more
satisfying
it
has
been
hotter
than
hell
here
in
florida
lately
so
i
decided
to
give
this
a
try
in
search
of
another
refreshing
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
warm
florida
summer
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
really
nice
looking
cloudy
pale
golden
white
color
almost
like
a
yellowish
witbier
the
aroma
is
more
lemonade
than
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
wheat
peaking
through
the
lemons
the
taste
is
a
hint
of
wheat
mixed
with
an
unsweetened
lemonade
flavoring
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
mixing
things
into
beer
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
it
is
not
really
bad
or
offensive
but
it
simply
isnt
my
thing
drinkability
refreshing
beer
but
too
much
of
a
lemon
taste
here
d
i
dont
really
know
about
this
one
i
dont
think
i
can
drink
another
full
bottle
of
this
stuff
again
i
hope
my
wife
drinks
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
after
all
it
was
her
idea
to
get
this
stuff
i
am
surprised
by
how
much
i
like
it
as
a
summer
seasonal
granted
id
rather
mix
my
own
radler
or
russ
but
this
would
do
in
a
major
pinch
nothing
to
freak
out
about
nothing
to
bash
it
is
a
descent
gimmicky
beer
i
must
say
leine
does
brew
4
really
popular
wheat
ales
largely
for
the
nonba
crowd
summer
shandy
berry
weiss
honey
weiss
and
sunset
wheat
they
found
their
niche
kudos
to
them
id
classify
this
beer
as
another
lawnmower
beer
youre
hot
sweaty
smelly
and
stinky
from
cleaning
out
the
septic
tank
or
whatever
and
you
want
to
slake
your
thirst
grab
a
couple
of
these
guys
theyll
go
down
just
like
well
like
lemonade
youll
hammer
those
down
and
go
for
the
third
before
your
stomach
knows
it
has
a
visitor
but
if
youre
chillin
on
a
soso
day
looking
for
a
good
tasting
manly
beer
pass
this
one
up
and
grab
something
else
there
are
plenty
of
others
to
choose
from
d
definitely
drinkable
although
i
dont
think
i
could
stand
to
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
nice
refreshing
brew
for
the
summer
for
sure
dont
compare
this
to
your
favorite
ipa
or
ris
have
reasonable
expectations
and
you
might
just
find
that
this
brew
is
pleasing

to

and

can

off

the
smell
with

taste
of

to
begin
with
and
then
the
lemons
come
through
and
finishes
with
a
bitter

it
reminds
me
of
detergentlysol
lemon
and
while
i
like
to
mop
my
floors
with
iti
dont
know
if
its
what
i
want
to
smell
in
my
beertho
many
people
probably
do
this
tastes
like
lemon
dropsthe
hard
candywith
a
similar
sourness
that
is
actually
pleasenti
am
surprised
it
could
have
some
more
lemon
flavor
and
stronger
malt
presence
if
i
had
a
saybut
then
im
sure
my
girlfriend
would
hate
it
along
with
most
of
the
consumers
who
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
its
close
to
obnoxious
with
its
thin
body
and
foamy
carbonation
the
next
time
i
drink
this
it
will
be
freejust
like
this
time
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
one
i
havent
had
good
experiences
in
the
past
with
fruit
enhanced
beerssee
sam
adams
cranberry
lambic
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
bottle
i
had
maybe
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
weather
i
drank
it
on
a
94degree
day
with
typical
midwest
humidity
not
sure
if
its
more
like
lemonadeflavored
beer
or
beerflavored
lemonade
but
it
is
seriously
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
overall
this
is
going
in
my
not
a
beer
category
in
and
of
itself
its
not
horribly
bad
ive
had
much
worse
yet
at
the
same
time
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
with
beer
flavor
you
are
not
going
to
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
very
refreshing
especially
on
this
95
degree
spring
day
in
pa
however
remindes
me
of
mikes
hard
lemonade
but
better
actually
less
abv
but
thats
ok
nice
change
of
pace
but
not
for
an
oldtime
beerdrinker
its
worth
a
try
especially
in
the
hot
months
but
not
a
beer
to
have
with
the
game
or
with
your
old
man
smooth
refreshing
and
lemony
good
summer
refresher

does
a
good

leinenkugels
summer
shandy
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
it
smells
just
like
lemonade
the
body
is
very
light
as
is
the
flavor
up
front
the
lemonade
flavor
isnt
bad
but
then
it
seems
kind
of
artificial
in
the
finish
more
a
malternative
than
a
beer
d
i
dont
plan
on
getting
this
one
again
couldnt
finish
the
glass
md
light
beer
that
was
smooth
and
creamy
the
drinkability
was
extremely
harsh
and
because
of
the
sour
vomit
taste
it
was
very
hard
to
put
down
the
throat
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
that
you
can
drink
a
bounch
of
em
like
coors
light
the
lemon
is
nice
but
saying
its
infused
with
lemonade
is
a
little
misleading
the
appearance
is
average
all
the
leinies
look
the
same
with
the
exception
of
the
berry
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
an
introductory
drinker
overall
not
something
i
would
make
a
habit
out
of
d
this
was
really
tough
to
get
down
its
incredibly
tough
for
me
to
pour
something
out
but
this
was
tempting
i
powered
through
it
though
and
have
to
say
that
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
this
pale
wheat
ale
is
a
cloudy
yellow
color
and
has
a
beige
head
poor
retention
the
nose
has
a
mixture
of
grainy
malt
and
wheat
the
taste
is
light
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
mild
malts
a
middling
body
is
heavy
on
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkable
in
my
book
just
too
light
d
although
not
a
great
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
and
would
be
a
good
outside
on
a
hot
day
beer
this
is
a
simple
beer
somewhat
of
a
novelty
and
nothing
any
beer
lover
should
be
embarrassed
to
admit
liking
its
a
step
away
from
the
usual
summer
stuff
and
it
might
surprise
you
it
did
me
the
lemon
element
couldve
been
1
too
tart
2
too
sugarysweet
3
too
artificial
tasting
andor
4
wretched
but
its
none
of
that
its
just
a
nice
diversion
from
the
bigass
ales
many
of
us
usually
indulge
in
certainly
a
wiser
choice
than
evil
alcopops
or
those
limeinfused
beers
the
macro
brewers
are
crapping
out
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
a
refreshing
lemon
aftertaste
i
really
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
but
it
is
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
nothing
serious
to
be
sure
but
would
be
great
for
a
bbq
d
i
could
pick
up
a
sixer
here
and
there
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
d
a
refreshing
summer
time
alternative
that
looks
like
a
wit
but
drank
like
a
lemonade
cooler
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
aroma
was
fruity
dominated
by
lemons
has
a
very
citrusy
taste
to
it
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
body
is
on
the
thin
side
nothing
spectacular
but
not
offensive
and
easy
drinking
p
s
this
does
not
taste
like
other
american
pale
wheat
ales
more
like
a
fruitvegetable
beer
if
even
a
beer
overall
impression
well
i
havent
had
any
other
beers
of
this
style
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
to
that
being
said
the
beer
is
second
stage
here
this
is
an
alcoholic
lemonade
with
a
bit
of
beer
flavor
in
there
if
you
really
look
for
it
md
its
got
a
very
light
body
and
a
watery
mouthfeel
appropriate
for
the
style
theyre
going
for
theres
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
as
well
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
the
beer
is
light
and
summery
but
it
tastes
pretty
bad
i
wont
be
getting
another
bottle
ever
again
and
i
would
probably
drink
an
american
macro
over
this
if
i
was
just
chilling
on
the
porch
in
my
humble
opinion
im
not
to
impressed
with
the
summer
shandy
i
will
say
though
i
think
the
brewers
succeeding
in
what
they
were
attempting
to
accomplish
this
is
a
beer
and
not
a
wine
cooler
it
does
a
good
job
satisfying
thirst
and
can
likely
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
it
is
not
something
id
purchase
necessarily
but
it
does
have
its
place
among
beers
12oz
brown
bottle
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
intensely
sweet
and
lemony
almost
like
fake
lemonade
tastes
very
citrusy
and
somewhat
pithy
though
the
flavor
isnt
as
intense
as
the
aroma
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
not
bad
very
easydrinking
and
refreshing
and
i
can
definitely
see
putting
back
a
couple
of
these
after
a
long
hot
day
that
said
it
seems
less
beery
and
more
like
an
alcopop
though
it
beats
the
heck
out
of
mikes
or
the
like
nice
attempt
at
something
different
but
they
need
to
tweak
the
recipe
before
i
try
it
again
caught
somewhere
between
lemonade
and
an
american
wheat
the
beer
is
both
appetizing
and
distracting
at
the
same
time
the
aroma
opens
with
a
burst
of
lemons
with
a
confectionate
counterpart
that
takes
the
acidity
off
of
the
nose
a
wheat
malt
balance
attempts
to
balance
out
the
lemonade
character
but
falls
a
bit
short
looks
timid
on
the
wheat
with
a
slight
haze
fizzy
head
formation
and
low
retention
levels
straw
colored
and
overcarbonated
quite
spritzy
flavors
are
dominated
by
the
lemonade
sweetness
and
tartness
with
again
lacking
wheat
beer
flavors
lightly
bready
underhopped
and
a
timid
barley
wheat
base
malt
flavor
keeps
the
beer
acidic
and
onedimentional
textures
are
light
crisp
and
a
bit
thin
but
certainly
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
finishes
well
lemony
with
that
mild
bread
base
palate
cleansing
and
ready
for
the
next
sip
the
beer
is
pleasant
enough
despite
the
lack
of
beer
qualities
unfortunately
in
spite
of
my
love
for
leines
sunset
wheat
i
have
yet
to
enjoy
any
of
their
other
varieties
although
not
as
sickening
as
the
berry
weiss
this
beer
is
no
exception
it
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
watered
down
lemonade
it
reminds
of
mikes
hard
lemonade
which
i
dislike
as
it
tastes
nothing
like
beer
i
imagine
leinenkugel
is
attempting
to
copy
radler
a
combination
of
beer
and
sprite
as
this
made
me
think
of
the
radler
i
drank
in
germany
however
there
is
not
enough
beer
flavor
to
this
brew
to
make
it
enjoyable
i
couldnt
finish
even
one
bottle
the
aroma
is
great
the
color
when
poured
gives
the
appearance
of
an
unfiltered
beer
the
first
taste
leaves
you
in
confusion
as
to
what
type
of
beverage
you
are
drinking
overall
this
is
a
good
summer
drink
it
is
light
fruity
and
quite
tastey
once
you
adjust
to
it
just
picked
this
one
up
and
i
am
enjoying
it
chilled
in
my
samuel
smith
pub
glass
pours
a
very
cloudy
pale
sulfur
color
with
an
enormous
white
headthat
stays
up
for
ever
and
leaves
great
lacing
smells
very
delightful
just
like
fresh
lemonade
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
it
is
pretty
much
like
lemon
water
and
nothing
much
more
smooth
at
first
and
then
a
sting
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
before
a
wet
lemony
finish
pretty
good
beer
but
needs
more
flavor
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
this
weekend
it
was
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
not
for
the
beer
drinker
who
doesnt
like
a
light
summery
beer
i
expected
it
to
be
lemony
since
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
its

not
for
me
once
again
they
got
the
orange
just
right
covers
up
the
tin
taste
that
wheat
beers
have
wife
is
always
bummed
when
they
run
out
i
really
tried
to
like
this
but
it
tasted
like
fizzy
bad
orange
soda
with
a
very
light
feeling
white
beer
could
have
done
without
the
extra
fizz
and
a
little
sweeter
a
little
out
of
season
as
this
was
hiding
in
my
fridge
since
midsummer
but
a
welcome
break
from
the
robust
stouts
and
spiced
creations
of
the
holidays
frothy
white
meringuelike
head
forms
after
an
assertive
pour
in
to
a
tall
weizen
glass
the
2
finger
crest
settles
in
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
with
little
to
no
lacing
this
brew
could
pass
for
fresh
squeezed
oranges
with
its
hazy
unfiltered
appearance
and
juicelike
color
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
half
time
at
youth
soccer
matches
with
freshly
sliced
oranges
taking
center
stage
against
the
backdrop
of
a
grassy
pitch
the
flavor
is
not
altogether
different
than
what
is
achieved
by
dropping
a
slice
of
orange
in
to
insert
random
american
pale
wheat
ale
although
with
little
other
pronounced
flavor
the
wheaty
mouthfeel
gives
it
some
body
and
helps
add
a
little
depth
with
a
grainlike
finish
pleasantly
refreshing
i
am
detecting
some
sour
citrus
notes
lemon
pith
and
sweet
candied
oranges
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
helps
create
a
thirstquenching
quaff
if
you
are
an
aficianado
of
orange
soda
then
this
is
your
beer
im
not
sure
if
this
can
really
be
called
beer
actually
but
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
its
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
in
to
my
second
pour
as
i
finish
this
review
the
low
abv
only
adds
to
the
refreshment
ill
be
looking
forward
to
this
one
each
summer
and
will
gladly
drink
this
over
the
abhorrent
lemon
shandy
varieties
that
ive
tried
unlike
their
recipe
of
dumping
countrytime
lemonade
in
to
a
cheap
wheat
beer
this
one
seems
more
natural
and
palatable
its
a
onetrick
pony
with
a
pretty
nice
trick
disappointed
with
this
one
love
orange
but
it
is
just
not
my
bag
aroma
is
great
but
it
cant
save
the
taste
tasty
refreshing
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
beers
best
quality
has
gotta
be
its
smell
it
smells
like
orange
juice
so
if
you
have
a
nagging
wife
or
if
you
want
to
have
a
bottle
at
work
just
pour
it
into
a
glass
and
tell
people
youre
drinking
healthy
orange
juice
itll
be
our
little
secret
had
this
on
draft
at
a
local
restaurant
and
on
bottle
this
is
good
in
the
bottle
but
much
much
better
on
draft
good
on
a
cold
snowy
night
with
friends
a
fun
quaffable
winter
beer
very
orange
in
smell
and
taste
it
doesnt
even
really
taste
like
beer
it
would
be
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
like
an
orangeade
got
together
with
a
beer
some
may
not
like
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
have
a
very
strong
hoppy
flavor
but
i
think
its
just
right
for
a
relaxing
day
i
enjoyed
this
on
a
beautiful
indian
summer
day
and
perhaps
the
last
of
the
balmy
days
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
considering
how
good
the
summer
shandy
is
but
not
terrible
it
tastes
a
bit
artificial
and
maybe
a
bit
too
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
not
bad
though
being
unable
to
find
an
individual
bottle
or
can
of
this
stuff
for
a
couple
years
now
imagine
my
happy
surprise
to
find
this
on
tap
during
my
first
visit
to
a
hooters
thanks
by
the
way
to
my
man
vdubb
and
his
lovely
wife
it
pours
a
cloudy
brassamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
straight
creamsicle
undercut
by
a
bit
of
wet
wheat
the
taste
leads
with
the
wheat
now
less
wet
then
proceeds
into
some
orange
wedge
and
then
a
bit
of
coriander
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
was
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
sadness
that
is
summer
shandy
however
little
that
actually
says
but
it
falls
a
bit
short
for
me
in
terms
of
full
enjoyment
its
not
bad
but
nothing
i
feel
like
trying
again
any
time
soon
overall
i
liked
their
summer
shandy
but
this
edges
it
out
great
light
flavor
for
the
summer
time
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
relaxing
outside
would
definitely
pick
up
again
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
for
this
brew
it
surprised
me
while
it
was
artificially
sweet
i
actually
enjoyed
the
orange
shandy
it
can
be
overpowering
with
orange
flavoring
but
overall
not
bad
overall
3
64
much
better
than
their
summer
shandy
all
in
all
its
a
capable
beer
and
worthy
of
a
try
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
grabbing
more
of
these
for
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
or
in
the
shade
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
which
isnt
very
good
i
may
buy
this
brew
again
o
a
nice
shandy
very
refreshing
but
not
a
good
session
brew
imho
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
mostly
smells
like
oranges
and
orange
peel
along
with
a
general
citrus
aroma
reminds
me
of
tang
and
other
orange
like
citrus
drinks
and
some
breadygrainy
malt
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
it
does
remind
me
more
of
a
slightly
watered
down
citrusorange
drink
than
a
fruit
beer
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
like
this
i
think
its
a
good
choice
for
a
warmer
day
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
leinenkugel
consistently
amazes
me
for
being
a
mainstream
brewer
they
release
ample
amounts
of
unique
and
often
complex
beers
even
if
im
not
a
big
fan
of
some
of
their
offers
ie
canoe
paddler
which
im
looking
to
retry
next
season
the
fact
that
they
can
throw
out
multiple
different
shandies
season
offerings
and
unique
looking
beers
such
as
creamy
dark
and
red
lager
year
after
year
is
nothing
short
of
amazing
orange
shandy
is
definitely
my
current
favorite
of
their
offerings
by
far
more
smooth
than
most
shandys
first
i
liked
blue
moon
because
you
have
the
orange
to
offset
the
taste
then
i
progressed
to
shock
top
now
this
is
the
ultimate
orange
beer
no
orange
needed
and
no
harshness
like
with
blue
moon
this
is
a
must
try
seasonal
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
beach
or
anytime
excellent
shandy
for
every
season
think
creamy
head
good
taste
would
of
expected
more
of
an
orange
taste
then
what
there
was
we
play
a
lot
of
yard
games
in
my
neighborhood
and
beer
often
gets
real
warm
while
outside
no
matter
ive
drank
this
beer
almost
tepid
in
temp
and
it
still
tasted
good
and
went
down
smooth
perfect
summer
beer
when
its
really
hot
outside
extremely
refreshing
o
nothing
special
but
decent
for
what
it
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
while
mowing
the
lawn
low
abv
and
refreshing
flavor
make
it
a
good
session
beer
for
someone
looking
to
drink
a
few
without
worrying
about
getting
hammered
this
beer
is
palatable
with
a
shot
of
high
quality
bourbon
to
offset
the
orange
fanta
flavor
with
a
4
2
alcohol
content
the
bourbon
is
a
definite
prerequisite
its
no
wonder
wisconsin
is
always
cold
and
gloomy
but
at
9
98
for
a
case
of
bottles
you
cant
go
wrong
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
orange
candy
and
orange
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
watery
orange
soda
and
orange
chewable
vitamin
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
it
has
a
somewhat
artificial
quality
in
the
aromas
and
flavors
overall
a
solid
beer
to
end
the
evening
at
an
affordable
price
a
credible
alternative
to
any
of
the
beergaritas
and
hard
lemonade
products
in
the
same
market
space
a
big
disappointment
the
orange
is
artificial
almost
tasted
like
tang
this
was
tough
to
choke
down
the
overall
orange
flavor
overpowered
everything
else
and
it
was
a
poor
orange
taste
at
that
weak
head
the
almost
a
dry
taste
in
the
mouth
ended
up
drinking
three
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
so
to
sum
up
its
interesting
and
quite
refreshing
if
you
like
shandys
this
has
more
alcohol
than
quite
a
few
of
the
european
versions
and
its
not
as
sweet
id
recommend
trying
it
to
others
provided
they
dont
mind
some
fruityness
in
their
beers
it
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
smell
has
a
orange
juice
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
like
the
summer
shandy
juice
with
orange
flavor
the
flavor
has
a
light
orange
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
a
good
beer
thanks

overall
it
wasnt
as
sweet
and
juicy
as
i
expected
a
mass
produced
shandy
to
be
orange
is
noticeable
but
not
too
dominant
this
one
tastes
basically
like
a
blue
moon
that
they
put
an
orange
slice
in
o
the
overall
generic
orange
taste
is
just
way
too
overpowering
o
orange
juice
with
a
malty
finish
it
not
had
and
is
pretty
refreshing
but
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
beer
i
also
find
it
strange
that
this
is
in
the
fall
variety
pack
as
opposed
to
spring
or
summer
another
bizarre
concoction
from
jake
and
the
crew
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
nice
waft
of
orange
very
similar
to
a
tequila
sunrise
pours
into
the
only
glass
i
have
handy
with
a
thin
but
fine
bubble
creamy
head
topping
a
cloudy
orange
mimosalike
appearance
on
the
taste
the
tartness
of
the
orange
hits
first
followed
by
classic
sweeter
orange
flavor
then
all
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
hoppiness
that
clears
out
the
orange
unique
indeed
for
what
it
is
it
is
spot
on
this
would
be
a
great
brew
on
a
hot
day
ice
cold
or
good
on
a
cold
winter
day
at
room
temperature
do
i
dare
say
it
may
even
make
a
good
hot
toddy
maybe
have
to
try
it
and
see
was
hesitant
to
try
this
due
to
bad
experiences
with
lambrics
but
orange
seems
to
compliment
this
brew
well
o
not
a
good
beer
i
enjoy
the
summer
shandy
from
time
to
time
but
this
isnt
working
a
recreation
of
their
famous
lemon
shandy
this
orange
brew
lacks
the
refreshment
and
easy
of
consumption
that
the
lemon
one
has
and
seems
a
little
out
of
season
in
the
winter
now
but
still
isnt
a
bad
brew
it
just
looks
like
a
light
wheat
beer
with
a
pretty
decent
head
on
it
that
doesnt
last
the
nose
is
orange
heavy
not
artificial
either
but
fresh
and
pulpy
the
fruit
part
smells
nice
but
in
combination
with
beer
ingredients
it
gets
a
little
funny
and
smells
like
the
base
of
a
barbeque
sauce
or
something
it
taste
also
very
orange
forward
like
carbonated
fresh
orange
juice
i
like
the
freshness
of
the
fruit
but
it
overpowers
any
grain
or
hops
and
results
in
a
beverage
that
may
refresh
some
but
falls
short
of
tasting
like
beer
to
me
and
thats
a
problem
again
no
off
flavors
here
just
too
much
fruit
to
still
be
beer
i
really
do
like
the
lemon
shandy
i
think
the
lemon
flavors
blend
better
with
the
lager
but
this
one
is
out
of
balance
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
a
drinkable
brew
perhaps
better
suited
for
hot
weather
than
prethanksgiving
frost
maybe
i
will
revisit
this
in
the
summer
maybe
not
this
is
pretty
gross
really
the
lemon
shandy
has
some
redeeming
qualities
but
this
one
is
just
too
overboard
on
the
artificial
citrus
juices
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
overcarbed
just
not
really
refreshing
and
too
much
orange
zest
flavors
o
if
youre
trying
to
watch
your
figure
and
need
something
light
to
go
with
a
low
calorie
snack
this
beer
works
other
than
that
its
pretty
average
on
all
accounts
the
taste
is
like
a
mix
of
orange
soda
and
light
beer
pretty
much
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
not
a
bad
flavor
actually
it
is
refreshing
and
could
serve
as
a
palate
refresher
if
sampling
heavy
or
high
gravity
beers
perhaps
i
would
say
give
it
a
try
overall
i
approve
the
pride
of
chippewa
falls
in
a
brown
bottle
immediate
orange
zest
syrup
bitter
flavor
accompanies
a
light
body
and
soft
carbonation
reminds
me
of
a
beach
barbecue
in
southern
california
barely
detectable
hops
with
a
light
malt
backdrop
4
2
alcohol
makes
it
very
drinkable
a
simple
beer
i
could
enjoy
one
or
two
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
outdoors
but
overall
very
average
and
forgettable
overall
this
is
what
i
expect
out
of
a
fruit
beer
since
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
are
just
regular
beers
with
fruit
flavor
while
i
am
more
of
a
hops
guy
i
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
my
favorite
low
alcohol
beer
under
5
is
low
to
me
its
very
orangey
but
the
label
should
give
you
some
hints
of
that
its
a
great
flavor
and
not
too
strong
tasting
would
be
one
id
reccommend
for
new
beer
drinkers

a
big
shout
out
to

this

poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
cloudy

color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
oranges
taste
is
a
bit
tart
lots
of
oranges
some
wheat
very
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
would
be
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
a
very
smooth
and
surprisingly
crisp
beer
for
one
released
in
the
fall
and
i
really
enjoy
beers
like
this
the
hazy
color
seemed
to
blend
perfectly
into
the
spirit
of
fall
but
the
flavor
seems
out
of
place
for
the
season
its
something
that
if
it
really
is
only
available
this
time
of
year
that
i
would
advise
hanging
on
to
until
spring
other
than
that
its
a
fantastic
drink
and
one
i
know
ill
be
having
plenty
more
of
got
this
in
the
winter
sampler
pack
not
sure
what
this
is
doing
in
the
winter
sampler
seems
more
like
a
summer
beer
drank
out
of
the
bottle
didnt
have
a
glass
available
looked
kinda
hazy
orange
when
i
looked
in
the
bottle
smell
was
very
strong
of
orange
when
i
took
my
first
drink
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
generic
orange
soda
way
to
strong
on
the
orange
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
odd
i
felt
like
i
had
coated
my
mouth
with
sugar
overall
just
not
a
beer
for
me
maybe
if
it
was
100
degrees
outside
and
i
was
craving
something
orange
but
i
think
i
would
just
go
with
a
soda
instead
o
tickers
gonna
tick
amirite
o
not
tasty
at
all
does
not
go
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
even
for
a
shandy
this
is
not
a
good
beer
in
any
respect
thin
bodied
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
average
carbonation
just
a
bad
beer
i
have
never
liked
a
beer
with
artificial
flavor
and
thats
about
all
this
beer
has
avoid
overall
drinkability
like
i
said
this
is
a
bit
summery
for
a
fall
release
a
little
more
yeast
and
body
and
a
little
less
orange
and
this
is
blue
moon
overall
a
sweeter
and
rather
refreshing
summer
brew
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
blend
of
lemonade
orange
juice
and
beer
while
not
quite
appropriate
for
winter
style
drinking
at
least
not
up
north
it
is
a
decent
sweet
summer
style
refreshing
brew
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
liked
how
it
wasnt
sweet
and
didnt
seem
watery
o
having
never
had
a
shandy
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
i
have
had
fruity
beers
and
enjoyed
them
so
this
seemed
like
a
perfect
choice
for
a
hot
unautumnlike
october
night
the
smell
and
the
taste
dont
match
it
tastes
much
less
orangey
than
it
smells
i
enjoyed
this
beer
tonight
but
cant
say
id
get
it
again
because
i
rarely
crave
beer
like
this
as
far
as
fruity
shandies
go
this
isnt
great
but
it
is
above
average
a
nice
fruity
something
different
drink
to
have
on
a
hot
day
o
not
terrible
but
definitely
all
orange
and
not
much
else
going
on
here
overall
il
admit
im
not
into
shandys
but
this
is
a
decent
example
of
one
not
a
good
beer
much
poorer
than
their
summer
shandy
which
i
actually
like
sadly
ive
got
two
more
cans
of
this
rjt
overall
this
is
a
fun
beer
for
a
warm
day
but
the
acidity
could
be
too
much
for
me
to
session
more
than
one
or
two
this
could
be
a
nice
pallet
cleanser
in
the
middle
of
a
session
though
leinenkugels
orange
shandy
35
this
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
has
wheat
mixed
with
orange
zest
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
an
orange
version
of
summer
shandy
the
texture
is
a
little
too
thin
and
the
flavor
doesnt
exactly
wow
me
either
i
do
like
oranges
more
than
lemons
though
if
i
had
to
choose
however
buffalo
bills
orange
cream
is
still
a
better
option
if
they
still
have
it
in
your
area
overall
tastes
better
than
the
lemonade
version
bought
in
a
12bottle
autumn
variety
pack
that
just
came
out
on
81
sampled
8213
after
chilling
in
my
beer
cooler
to
36
degrees
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
in
color
with
a
2finger
white
head
some
lacing
is
seen
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
orange
and
grains
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
was
really
good
and
is
the
same
as
the
smell
perfect
carbonation
and
goes
down
very
easy
no
bad
aftertaste
and
was
refreshing
great
summer
brew
overall
really
liked
this
one
overall
i
would
probably
put
this
in
the
middle
of
the
three
shandys
i
have
had
from
leinies
not
as
good
as
the
lemon
berry
one
not
offensive
but
there
are
other
fruit
beers
i
would
try
first
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
orange
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
of
orange
very
strongly
almost
like
orange
dreamscile
however
with
a
slight
hint
of
cereal
grain
tastes
of
orange
much
more
natural
than
the
smell
and
grain
not
much
different
than
other
shandys
beer
is
sessionable
light
bodied
going
down
smooth
carbonated
perfectly
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
o
orange
flavored
summer
wheat
beer
ok
at
that
orange
shandy
pours
a
hazy
yelloworangeish
color
with
a
nice
small
long
lasting
lacing
head
there
is
a
orange
aroma
that
is
similar
to
orange
hand
soap
the
taste
is
similar
to
soap
with
small
orange
notes
but
has
a
barely
noticeable
malty
and
wheat
like
backbone
a
bit
watery
which
may
be
a
good
thing
if
the
flavors
would
be
any
stronger
it
would
be
undrinkable
overall
its
a
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
summers
bbq
day
but
dont
expect
anything
to
great
i
will
say
it
was
refreshing
at
the
lake
over
july
4th
weekend
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
i
like
beer
the
score
is
what
it
is
this
is
a
beer
as
a
drink
its
not
great
but
better
than
it
is
as
a
beer
c
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
mediocre
and
a
slightly
below
average
example
of
the
style
the
orange
tang
aspect
was
just
too
overpowering
and
it
stuck
out
a
little
too
much
i
would
rather
have
a
more
natural
orange
flavor
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
a
little
refreshing
but
the
flavors
really
didnt
hold
my
attention
so
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
session
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
its
a
decent
looking
shandy
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
the
orange
tang
aspect
it
would
be
better
with
a
more
natural
orange
flavor
i
wouldnt
by
the
beer
on
its
own
i
would
rather
have
summer
shandy
or
lemon
berry
shandy
and
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
beer
all
in
all
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
leinenkugels
three
shandys
with
summer
shandy
being
my
favorite
i
appreciate
the
attempt
but
this
one
just
didnt
work
for
me
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
maybe
orange
and
beer
just
dont
go
together
well
in
any
event
this
one
clearly
isnt
working
too
well
it
comes
off
as
artificial
and
simply
doesnt
taste
that
great
o
this
beer
was
surprisingly
ok
not
bad
not
great
just
an
as
expected
beer
from
leinenkugel
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
people
rip
on
this
company
cause
its
a
macro
and
a
lot
of
people
praise
it
cause
they
have
no
palate
for
beer
if
it
were
cheaper
id
buy
it
until
then
ill
stick
to
my
cheapass
steigl
radler
for
a
light
fruity
brew
if
you
like
grapefruit
and
fruity
beer
check
it
out
only
89
cents
for
a
pint
can
at
my
local
craft
store
my
crack
and
inverted
glug
produced
but
a
momentary
head
of
fizzy
eggshellwhite
head
with
decidedly
low
retention
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishyellow
much
like
freshlysqueezed
orange
or
grapefruit
juice
nose
smelled
artificially
of
orange
and
when
i
closed
my
eyes
i
thought
back
to
tang
which
is
what
the
astronauts
drank
once
upon
a
time
in
the
here
and
now
it
had
a
thin
mouthfeel
but
quite
effervescent
it
tasted
like
a
liquified
dreamsicle
and
i
felt
like
a
little
kid
again
i
used
to
love
both
tang
and
dreamsicles
but
now
it
seemed
cloyingly
sweet
finish
was
likewise
very
sweet
and
i
began
to
wonder
who
i
would
share
this
with
it
would
not
be
my
current
old
lady
as
she
would
laugh
at
me
for
drinking
such
a
beverage
it
should
be
shared
though
as
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
by
myself
poured
into
a
red
solo
cup
wooo
a
somewhat
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
large
fizzy
white
head
that
soon
died
down
to
a
wispy
layer
of
bubbles
with
sodalike
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
aroma
of
orange
candy
and
light
stinky
grains
tasted
like
orange
drink
and
seltzer
with
some
stale
malts
in
the
background
not
that
i
expected
much
but
whatever
consistency
of
water
but
goes
down
like
it
too
so
at
least
theres
that
chicks
might
dig
this
but
not
me
plenty
of
other
much
better
summertime
quenchers
out
there
as
i
sit
here
sucking
down
the
last
few
cans
of
this
monstrosity
the
eight
summer
and
lemon
berry
varieties
at
least
got
me
buzzed
enough
to
tolerate
it
i
can
only
say
this
never
again
eff
you
leinenkugels
for
violating
my
taste
buds
in
such
a
horrible
way
bottom
line
this
beer
tastes
like
failure
stay
away
that
being
said
is
it
a
craft
brew
that
we
should
pick
apart
and
take
down
nope
it
fits
a
solid
niche
and
it
fits
it
well
eh
what
did
i
expect
not
a
lot
and
because
of
that
i
wasnt
really
let
down
in
fact
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
than
summer
shandy
and
im
sure
this
would
prove
to
be
extremely
quaffable
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
not
a
great
summer
brew
awesome
cans
but
thats
where
the
awesome
ends
this
is
the
perfect
backyard
bbq
beer
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
delicious
blend
of
watermelon
that
isnt
too
overbearing
with
little
after
taste
an
all
around
perfect
beer
for
those
late
summer
nights
in
the
yard
with
friends
horrible
one
of
the
worst
ever
i
have
to
give
it
the
grade
i
did
in
a
hats
off
manner
just
given
the
fact
that
they
actually
accomplished
a
watermelon
note
blended
with
a
fruity
wheat
flavor
is
somewhat
exceptional
to
me
not
that
its
a
great
beer
but
bc
if
the
feat
itself
i
cant
say
ill
ever
have
another
but
this
is
proof
american
brewers
are
yet
again
pushing
the
limits
of
flavor
it
poured
a
milky
golden
with
a
reasonably
nice
head
the
smell
was
a
lot
less
pungent
than
i
had
expected
citrusy
sweet
notes
with
some
of
that
wheaty
body
the
taste
was
interesting
at
first
i
almost
spit
it
out
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
watermelon
but
i
steadied
myself
and
kept
trying
it
the
taste
settled
and
it
actually
became
rather
pleasant
its
a
nice
drinking
beer
on
a
summer
day
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
unless
youre
going
home
for
the
summer
and
need
a
beer
to
drink
for
that
delicious
summer
beer
watermelon
taste
is
just
right
not
to
sweet
poured
into
tulip
hazy
yellow
a
tiny
little
bit
pink
smell
is
good
yeast
and
wheat
and
a
bit
of
sour
watermelon
at
the
end
the
taste
is
dryish
straw
like
good
feel
with
watermelon
rind
at
the
end
i
was
excited
seeing
this
beer
but
the
watermelon
was
sour
and
drying
id
still
buy
it
again
though
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
for
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
love
it
just
a
hint
of
watermelon
in
the
finish
other
then
that
its
no
different
then
a
coors
light
smooth
beer
cool
watermelon
aftertaste
perfect
for
the
summer
time
very
drinkable
watermelon
is
nice
touch
great
beer
light
fruity
easy
to
drink
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
tried
it
just
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
and
i
actually
enjoyed
the
light
watermelon
flavoring
of
this
beer
this
is
pretty
decent
summer
beer
refreshing
and
very
well
balanced
watermelon
is
definitely
there
but
it
is
not
predominant
also
it
is
not
heavy
on
wheat
and
with
perceivable
hops
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
nice
subtle
watermelon
flavor
with
a
bit
of
peppery
bite
it
does
feel
a
bit
watery
though
which
can
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
what
your
looking
for
i
find
it
good
on
a
lazy
hot
day
during
summer
icy
cold
the
can
art
is
great
as
well
something
different
has
a
jolly
rancher
watermelon
vibe
to
it
id
get
it
again
if
i
saw
it
o
gets
a
little
cloying
with
the
watermelon
after
one
or
two
so
its
not
the
most
seasonable
wheat
beer
nice
on
warm
summer
days
while
floating
in
the
pool
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
fruited
wheat
beers
rating
c
75100
ugh
had
high
hopes
for
this
after
founders
waltermelon
but
it
was
no
bueno
had
to
choke
it
down
wheat
on
the
front
of
this
beer
that
quickly
transitions
to
watermelon
this
lasts
for
a
few
sips
and
the
intense
flavor
of
the
watermelon
dissipates
this
is
a
very
bright
and
crisp
beer
very
light
mouth
feel
this
beer
at
the
start
has
a
candy
like
quality
to
it
the
watermelon
is
a
little
strong
at
the
start
but
this
subsides
quickly
and
the
beer
has
this
nice
light
fruit
flavor
to
it
overall
interesting
beer
lots
of
watermelon
a
little
wheat
and
a
touch
of
honey
interesting
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
but
i
do
find
in
intriguing
overall
honestly
its
just
an
okay
kind
of
beer
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
if
you
like
wheat
beers
and
watermelon
then
this
is
your
beer
wheat
beers
are
kinda
gross
and
boring
imo
but
this
wasnt
terrible
overall
meh
more
water
than
melon
good
change
of
pace
from
ipas
porters
and
ris
i
am
lucky
enough
to
have
tried
this
at
21st
amndt
in
san
francisco
on
draft
served
with
a
fresh
watermelon
slice
yup
it
is
not
complete
without
the
fresh
fruit
and
please
dont
judge
by
the
from
a
can
experience
i
think
it
develops
a
metal
residue
flavor
which
i
could
actually
pick
up
on
draft
only
for
this
one
please
enjoy
the
freshest
and
most
refreshing
watermelon
beer
its
not
fake
and
its
not
too
sweet
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
choose
something
else
but
if
you
want
a
watermelon
deliciousness
thats
still
a
beer
buy
one
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
the
watermelon
addition
is
a
compliment
to
the
base
wheat
beer
and
doesnt
dominate
in
any
means
a
nice
summer
sipper
but
not
something
that
i
would
indulge
in
on
a
regular
basis
im
a
big
fan
of
21st
amendment
and
if
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
they
make
theyre
doing
something
very
right
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
honestly
tastes
like
watermelon
for
some
reason
here
you
go
watermelon
beginning
until
the
end
when
a
wheat
character
comes
in
to
cleanse
the
palate
a
bit
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
buy
it
in
the
summer
if
it
were
available
in
michigan
refreshing
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
after
cutting
the
lawn
d
very
drinkable
but
not
complex
kinda
like
watermelon
i
darn
like
it
this
is
a
delicious
brew
i
would
turn
this
on
to
someone
who
doesnt
have
much
experience
with
the
hoppier
craft
brews
but
wants
to
develop
their
palate
it
has
just
hints
of
fruit
and
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
an
excellent
hotsummerday
brew
overall
not
too
bad
its
not
a
world
beater
though
the
watermelon
flavor
is
nice
but
the
base
beer
could
be
a
little
bit
better
taste
palate
its
lightly
bodied
and
like
its
aroma
it
has
light
pale
bready
and
wheat
maltiness
with
a
light
sweetness
and
an
equally
balanced
watermelon
flavor
again
like
its
aroma
it
also
has
a
slight
mineral
flavor
note
and
just
a
very
light
herbal
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
notes
this
is
definitely
a
hot
summer
day
or
lawn
mower
beer
its
thin
and
light
making
it
easy
drinking
and
interesting
it
like
that
the
watermelon
taste
is
natural
and
some
candy
like
flavoring
added
to
a
light
wheat
beer
o
nice
easy
summer
beer
some
mellon
flavors
alot
of
sweetness
some
off
flavors
just
a
light
wheat
beer
with
a
touch
of
fruit
overall
not
too
shabby
for
a
warm
weather
beer
pours
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
typical
wheat
beer
aromas
with
a
little
soapiness
and
some
watermelon
flavor
is
light
and
crisp
with
apparent
but
not
overwhelming
watermelon
notes
i
like
this
its
unique
but
well
executed
good
summer
brew
overall
it
stops
just
short
of
being
refreshing
o
this
beer
serves
its
purpose
as
an
innocuous
inoffensive
wheat
beer
with
some
watermelon
flavoring
thrown
in
to
make
it
a
bit
different
its
a
quaffer
great
for
music
festivals
and
sporting
events
where
you
just
want
something
semirefreshing
and
accessible
to
gulp
and
share
with
friends
especially
good
for
the
nonbeerloving
females
in
the
overall
scheme
of
things
though
there
are
much
better
things
to
be
drank
out
there
a
boring
wheat
beer
with
buttery
offflavors
o
a
good
summer
brew
for
a
hot
day
and
excellent
if
you
like
watermelon
and
beer
i
suppose
o
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
id
spend
the
money
on
this
brew
again
theres
plenty
of
other
great
session
beer
options
i
loved
the
way
the
watermelon
added
to
this
beer
not
overpowering
sweetness
just
some
light
melon
flavor
in
the
background
refreshing
yet
slightly
dry
this
is
an
excellent
summer
hot
weather
beer
nice
wheat
backbone
pale
golden
in
color
light
foamy
head
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
interesting
brew
id
imagine
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
be
quite
nice
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
some
o
someone
was
bound
to
make
a
watermelon
beer
eventually
and
im
glad
21st
amendment
did
this
kind
of
beer
isnt
my
thing
while
its
refreshing
i
can
think
of
more
enjoyable
beers
that
do
the
same
basic
thing
try
it
if
you
really
like
watermelon
otherwise
get
something
else
overall
this
is
just
not
the
beer
i
expected
its
not
a
decent
wheat
beer
and
i
really
only
get
a
tiny
bit
of
anything
resembling
watermelon
or
fruit
that
being
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
much
better
than
a
bud
or
something
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
as
it
was
a
total
letdown
a
perfect
beer
for
hanging
out
back
with
a
bbq
easy
drinking
slightly
fruity
some
citra
hop
presence
would
have
put
this
beer
over
the
top
it
would
of
complemented
this
watermelon
nice
go
get
it
o
its
refreshing
and
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
want
many
akin
to
abitas
strawberry
harvest
the
ale
underneath
the
fruit
offers
tepid
support
and
the
fruit
though
truly
seductive
seems
a
bit
contrived
if
the
balance
is
off
then
it
is
beautifully
off
i
have
a
soft
spot
on
my
palate
for
these
types
of
beer
normally
i
stay
away
from
fruit
flavored
beers
because
they
often
come
across
tasting
like
candy
or
are
just
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
not
with
hell
or
high
watermelon
you
get
a
hint
of
the
watermelon
and
it
doesnt
over
power
other
parts
of
the
beer
its
actually
one
of
my
go
to
beers
to
bring
to
summertime
bbqs
at
the
neighborhood
pool
its
very
refreshing
to
drink
on
a
hot
summers
day
interesting
beer
it
is
straw
colored
with
a
small
head
faint
haze
vegetal
smell
not
quite
watermelon
but
rather
a
watermelon
rind
and
stem
the
taste
though
is
very
summery
full
of
farm
watermelon
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
light
and
dry
but
very
genuine
interesting
and
fun
o
its
been
my
experience
trying
to
incorporate
the
flavor
of
natural
watermelon
into
a
beer
without
a
syrupy
fake
outcome
is
incredibly
hard
that
said
i
think
21st
amendment
has
done
a
fine
job
producing
such
a
beer
one
with
good
watermelon
flavor
incorporated
nicely
into
a
tried
at
three
monkeys
bar
grill
and
the
northside
grill
both
in
richmond
va
o
very
disappointed
i
was
looknig
forward
to
trying
this
beer
but
it
didnt
have
much
flavor
or
aroma
the
berry
flavor
it
did
have
seemed
artificial
im
not
sure
where
they
are
picking
up
the
watermelon
at
either
way
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
in
the
summer
but
would
never
want
to
drink
it
at
any
other
time
o
not
real
good
i
finished
the
glass
but
didnt
really
want
to
dont
like
the
watermelon
that
is
there
and
there
isnt
a
lot
of
it
as
far
as
a
wheat
beer
its
light
and
pilsnerlike
grainy
and
grassy
and
watery
just
not
my
favorite
but
not
terrible
12
ounce
can
canned
on
62713
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
the
brew
smells
mostly
like
sweet
and
bready
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
watermelon
jolly
rancher
candy
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
except
that
theres
more
balance
between
the
malty
and
watermelon
flavor
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
smooth
and
easy
enough
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
only
grabbed
this
since
i
was
able
to
get
a
single
can
at
my
local
kroger
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
but
its
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
before
the
appearance
isnt
bad
pale
cloudy
straw
color
2
fingers
of
lacing
which
dies
pretty
quickly
but
i
am
getting
about
as
much
taste
as
a
miller
lite
maybe
with
a
slight
watermelon
fruit
essence
and
slight
melon
odor
highly
carbonated
was
worth
one
try
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
but
will
never
get
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
can
taste
the
watermelon
much
more
then
can
smell
it
the
watermelon
flavors
go
along
with
but
also
do
not
overpower
the
wheat
many
fruitwheat
beers
seem
to
have
the
fruit
overpower
the
beer
but
this
does
not
watermelon
flavor
tastes
very
real
at
first
but
finishes
a
little
more
sweet
like
a
hint
of
watermelon
jolly
rancher
still
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
using
watermelon
which
i
have
not
seen
in
a
beer
before
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
crisp
finish
o
interesting
i
guess
fairly
good
in
terms
of
the
flavor
but
not
particularly
exciting
perfect
summer
beer
cool
and
refreshing
smooth
light
wheat
taste
with
great
real
watermelon
after
taste
doesnt
have
that
generic
fake
watermelon
after
taste
like
a
candy
no
bitterness
comparable
to
most
light
beers
in
wheat
flavor
but
with
the
additional
summer
fruitiness
overall
exactly
what
you
would
expect
a
watermelonwheat
beer
to
be
though
i
enjoy
how
the
watermelon
is
integrated
into
the
beer
i
wish
it
was
more
flavorful
this
does
make
a
very
good
summertime
session
beer
as
it
is
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
overall
just
plain
awful
this
beer
does
not
work
out
in
any
way
for
me
i
have
had
many
people
try
it
and
no
matter
their
beer
of
preference
or
level
of
intoxification
every
one
has
said
it
is
just
plain
bad
overall
impression
a
good
beer
to
quench
a
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
not
much
else
very
simplistic
and
somewhat
watery
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
watermelon
flavored
lite
american
lager
than
a
wheat
beer
from
its
very
very
light
body
overall
not
really
diggin
this
just
all
around
a
not
pleasant
experience
the
taste
has
got
a
watery
watermelon
taste
a
little
sweet
with
a
flower
like
geranium
finish
a
touch
of
perfume
in
the
mouth
it
is
strangely
alluring
very
easy
to
drink
but
certainly
wont
win
any
awards
kind
of
a
let
down
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
for
a
really
hot
day
in
hopes
of
sipping
at
a
refreshing
summer
beer
the
watermelon
flavor
doesnt
really
mesh
with
the
beer
well
it
tastes
really
artificial
like
watermelon
candy
if
you
want
a
watermelon
beer
i
would
recommend
thomas
hooker
if
possible
pours
a
nearlytransparent
lagerlike
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
heat
that
slowly
evaporates
the
aroma
is
a
musty
combination
of
hops
and
wheat
that
is
contrasted
by
a
fruity
brightness
from
the
watermelon
juice
the
flavor
similarly
features
the
light
juicy
watermelon
character
that
tries
to
uplift
sweeten
and
freshen
the
underlying
flavors
but
the
dull
wheat
and
musty
grassy
hops
keep
the
flavor
on
the
dry
side
the
fine
light
carbonation
gives
an
airiness
to
the
mouthfeel
that
also
works
to
lighten
the
flavors
overall
this
beer
is
different
interesting
but
mostly
gimmicky
rather
than
inspiring
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
light
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
to
a
thin
cap
aroma
of
melon
smells
a
bit
more
like
cantelope
actually
and
light
wheat
flavor
is
sweet
wheat
watermelon
distinct
in
the
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
as
it
finishes
slightly
dry
with
light
grassy
hops
light
bodied
as
appropriate
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
combination
but
the
light
watermelon
add
a
delicate
fruit
sweetness
to
the
wheat
which
worked
quite
well
i
would
definitely
think
about
this
for
lawn
mowing
this
would
have
been
too
light
for
a
witbier
but
delivers
exactly
what
it
advertises
as
a
watermelon
wheat
interesting
taste
but
not
enough
so
to
buy
again
the
smell
is
about
average
not
very
intriguing
the
taste
is
beerish
with
a
nice
blend
of
watermelon
fruit
lasting
in
the
end
almost
like
a
light
beer
with
a
watermelon
jolly
rancher
mixed
in
143
calories
per
can
with
4
9
abv
theres
not
much
to
this
beer
yet
i
feel
like
i
enjoyed
it
more
that
my
scores
would
suggest
to
put
it
in
context
im
grilling
and
sweating
and
its
hot
as
hades
out
here
it
was
quite
quenching
i
understand
this
beer
may
not
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
i
like
it
a
lot
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
refreshing
summertime
lawn
mower
type
beer
this
may
be
right
up
your
alley
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
film
of
head
the
nose
has
yeast
and
fruity
notes
this
offering
is
super
light
too
light
the
dominant
flavor
is
light
fruit
accompanied
by
a
fake
sour
essence
that
is
not
terribly
pleasant
the
finish
is
semidry
with
more
tangy
sourness
there
is
not
much
flavor
here
in
general
tasted
from
sampler
at
the
brew
pub
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
the
carbonation
is
pretty
active
on
your
tongue
and
the
beer
leaves
a
very
light
residue
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
and
roof
of
your
mouth
that
said
it
is
refreshing
another
beer
good
for
yard
work
o
not
bad
and
a
good
summer
beer
i
just
dont
see
this
being
anything
special
i
think
this
beer
is
great
with
summertime
arrived
this
is
a
great
beer
for
drinking
by
the
water
pretty
approachable
by
everyone
and
it
treats
the
fruit
wheat
beer
category
right
this
beer
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
i
feel
that
the
beer
advocate
rating
does
not
do
justice
to
this
sweet
wheat
the
first
sip
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
and
there
is
a
cumulative
watermelon
that
gradually
grows
in
your
mouth
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
sitting
outside
on
a
wharf
on
the
beach
delicious
o
ironically
this
beer
probably
would
be
pretty
good
without
the
watermelon
but
watermelon
it
is
and
this
beer
delivers
a
hefty
dose
of
it
though
in
the
end
i
dont
think
it
improves
it
o
decent
unique
beer
its
more
of
a
novelty
than
anything
but
i
imagine
grabbing
this
in
the
case
of
dying
of
thirst
pretty
quenching
and
i
cant
say
that
about
many
beers
d
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
much
of
a
fruit
beer
but
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
beer
the
flavor
has
a
dominating
watermelon
candy
flavor
to
it
without
any
redeeming
wheat
beer
qualities
i
enjoyed
this
more
on
draught
but
i
just
cant
recommend
it
in
cans
even
as
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
category
i
dont
think
i
would
have
ever
decided
to
try
watermelon
beer
if
there
were
no
outside
influences
but
i
had
just
read
an
online
article
about
coming
down
off
your
manly
beer
perch
and
trying
fruit
beers
in
total
wine
a
reasonably
attractive
woman
saw
me
looking
at
the
can
and
commented
that
it
was
very
good
with
a
winning
smile
these
forces
combined
with
my
uncontrollable
urge
to
try
something
new
or
different
everytime
im
faced
with
the
wall
of
beer
and
yes
it
should
be
capitialized
lead
me
to
setting
down
on
the
couch
to
watch
disney
channel
with
my
family
with
a
pale
yellow
fizzy
conncoction
smelling
like
one
of
the
kids
dropped
a
jolly
rancher
in
my
beer
after
the
first
drink
i
smiled
and
examinied
my
glass
again
hazy
yellow
thin
head
with
two
scents
a
good
wheat
and
candy
watermelon
i
smiled
wider
and
handed
the
glass
to
my
wife
what
does
that
taste
like
to
you
i
was
thinking
that
no
way
should
a
good
beer
and
watermelon
work
together
but
it
did
my
better
half
took
a
tenitive
sip
cherry
im
still
not
sure
how
she
got
that
bigger
swallow
watermelon
i
dont
think
the
normal
review
would
give
this
beer
its
due
long
and
short
of
it
is
it
tastes
good
low
enough
abv
to
qualify
as
sessionable
light
enough
to
allow
drinking
a
few
and
with
enough
flavor
that
you
want
to
now
i
will
say
that
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
people
to
session
but
give
it
a
try
for
what
its
worth
its
better
on
tap
the
beer
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
hint
of
orange
the
beer
forms
a
rocky
head
of
slightly
creamy
white
bubbles
the
beers
body
is
nearly
crystal
clear
with
just
a
faint
hazing
and
the
beers
head
leaves
a
lacing
of
sticky
dry
bubbles
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
tart
and
citric
with
a
nice
sweet
underlying
melon
scent
that
gives
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
there
is
also
a
slight
jammy
smell
that
is
a
part
of
the
melon
smell
but
i
assume
that
is
just
the
fruit
in
the
beer
from
the
can
the
sweet
fruit
is
more
pronounced
with
a
touch
of
vegetal
scents
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
with
a
light
tartness
and
some
lovely
distinctions
between
the
calmer
sweet
of
the
malt
and
the
fruitier
sweet
of
the
melon
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
bread
and
then
slowly
moves
into
distinct
bitter
watermelon
flavors
which
is
impressive
there
is
a
light
citric
tartness
underlying
the
flavors
but
the
water
melon
builds
into
a
big
sweet
crescendo
in
the
finish
leaving
the
aftertaste
clean
with
a
slight
hint
of
lingering
malt
sweetness
from
the
can
it
tastes
more
metallic
and
chemically
from
the
can
it
definitely
tastes
better
from
the
glass
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
crisp
and
on
the
heavier
side
of
light
in
body
with
a
touch
of
citric
spritz
from
the
medium
carbonation
levels
the
mouth
is
left
clean
and
a
little
tingly
with
some
slight
bitterness
overall
this
a
great
crisp
summer
beer
that
incorporates
the
watermelon
flavor
beautifully
it
is
not
too
sweet
just
a
touch
tart
and
just
a
touch
bitter
and
is
great
to
drink
it
is
a
great
fruit
beer
with
not
too
much
overpowering
fruit
try
this
beer
that
being
said
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
21st
amendment
beer
the
watermelon
is
very
poignant
and
almost
tastes
like
gatorade
i
drank
five
of
these
without
even
thinking
about
it
great
summer
beer
i
poured
this
watery
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
not
cold
enough
the
beer
was
a
pee
colored
concoction
but
did
poor
a
really
pretty
big
white
head
i
was
hopeful
slight
watermelon
smell
first
then
kinda
sour
smell
worried
slightly
cloudy
looking
also
the
beer
was
very
watery
tasting
kinda
like
watermelon
kool
aid
that
half
the
flavor
packet
had
not
made
it
into
the
mix
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
as
far
as
watermelon
beers
go
its
the
best
one
ive
had
simple
flavors
and
easy
drinking
overall
in
a
world
full
of
mediocre
fruited
summer
wheat
beers
i
feel
like
this
does
at
least
stand
out
a
bit
from
the
crowd
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
use
of
watermelon
i
thought
the
melon
worked
well
with
the
wheat
beer
base
not
excellent
by
any
means
but
if
im
looking
for
something
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
id
definitely
get
this
again
o
interesting
fruit
wheat
beer
subtle
watermelon
taste
a
refreshing
brew
but
nothing
i
would
grab
again
light
highly
drinkable
not
exceptional
but
interesting
good
session
candidate
pours
hazy
with
a
fair
amount
of
visible
carbonation
very
little
head
and
a
nice
bit
of
oily
lacing
that
persists
throughout
the
experience
i
can
faintly
smell
watermelon
but
i
also
know
its
supposed
to
be
there
i
can
definitely
taste
it
along
with
some
bitter
rind
and
some
thin
standard
flavors
of
a
lesser
wheat
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
ok
but
not
my
sort
of
beer
refreshing
but
not
a
winter
beer
in
my
eyes
which
is
when
i
had
it
this
is
a
strange
one
alright
and
while
i
appreciate
the
watermelon
rind
tartness
going
on
here
the
beer
lacks
all
of
the
hearty
chewy
characteristics
i
love
in
wheat
beers
i
paired
this
with
actual
watermelon
and
it
was
easier
to
drink
but
then
i
realized
that
the
watermelon
fruit
itself
was
more
flavorful
and
juicy
and
muted
the
beer
as
a
result
the
extra
graininess
alcohol
burn
and
thinness
does
not
make
this
as
refreshing
as
other
springsummer
alternatives
for
fans
of
novelty
beers
do
try
this
but
i
cant
recommend
this
as
much
as
id
like
to
can
poured
a
light
yellow
color
ale
with
a
small
pure
white
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
watermelon
and
light
wheat
malt
is
weird
and
not
really
enticing
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
watermelons
which
is
more
dominant
then
expected
with
some
light
wheat
malt
body
is
thin
with
light
carbonation
boring
thin
wheat
with
light
watermelon
flavours
emptied
into
a
sam
adams
glass
a
light
foamy
head
developed
which
dissipated
in
short
order
appearance
was
a
straw
yellow
with
a
hazy
hue
aroma
was
light
with
fruity
sweet
hints
and
slightly
sour
on
the
back
taste
was
fruity
and
did
remind
me
of
the
white
part
of
the
watermelon
taste
was
also
light
with
a
hint
of
sour
aftertaste
was
very
light
and
a
bit
sour
and
fruity
mouthfeel
was
watery
this
beer
is
weird
i
was
very
excited
to
try
it
and
i
thought
it
would
actually
be
a
little
more
fruity
than
it
is
watermelon
is
definitely
present
but
not
quite
in
the
capacity
i
would
have
liked
and
not
presented
in
the
manner
i
would
have
hoped
for
still
reasonably
drinkable
and
definitely
something
that
i
was
glad
to
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
this
one
again
o
an
odd
concoction
that
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
however
fans
of
fruit
beers
probably
wouldnt
find
watermelon
a
flavor
to
love
unless
it
was
more
candy
like
and
pronounced
id
look
elsewhere
something
also
on
trade
this
one
a
fruit
which
i
normally
dont
get
a
chance
to
try
much
pours
a
cloudy
pilsey
yellow
with
almost
no
head
and
little
lacing
smells
sweet
and
green
and
floral
taste
is
interesting
different
from
many
other
fruit
beers
surely
some
watermelon
but
only
hints
an
interesting
approach
to
a
fruit
beer
and
one
that
i
was
happy
to
try
easy
drinking
and
not
bitter
and
light
carbonation
is
only
lowmoderate
fun
to
try
the
color
when
poured
into
a
glass
was
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
hardly
any
foam
and
not
lace
at
all
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
yeasty
citrus
was
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
had
of
a
bitter
yeasty
watermelon
that
was
not
a
pleasant
feel
on
the
palate
this
is
not
what
i
would
expected
from
the
beer
company
not
one
of
their
better
brews
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
pillowy
white
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
watermelon
with
cake
and
mild
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
watermelon
throughout
with
lemon
cake
and
wheat
malt
notes
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
watermelon
and
the
rest
in
both
the
aroma
and
on
the
palate
its
mouthfeel
is
light
21st
amendment
hell
or
high
watermelon
wheat
beer
is
a
good
beer
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
refreshing
recommended
drink
i
thought
it
was
tasty
and
for
a
fruity
beer
with
a
wheat
background
i
would
anticipate
during
the
summer
this
would
taste
a
whole
lot
better
overall
had
one
of
these
leftover
from
summer
and
its
a
nice
hot
day
today
so
figured
id
kill
the
sixpack
this
is
probably
the
only
one
i
poured
into
a
glass
to
review
properly
the
rest
i
drank
straight
from
the
can
and
i
think
thats
how
these
should
be
enjoyed
floating
down
a
river
or
by
the
beach
in
a
tube
with
just
the
can
its
not
a
bad
summer
brew
but
i
think
the
artificial
flavor
would
turn
some
people
off
my
woman
didnt
like
it
and
shes
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
one
of
these
is
great
after
two
or
three
id
probably
get
tired
of
the
sweet
and
sourness
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
although
you
cant
taste
the
watermelon
in
the
beer
it
is
a
pretty
apparent
going
down
this
is
a
good
fruit
and
herb
beer
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
nice
sunny
summer
afternoon
this
brew
poured
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
body
was
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
with
mild
visible
carbonation
the
nose
was
very
muted
i
only
got
a
hint
of
watermelon
i
remember
this
having
more
of
a
nose
the
last
time
that
i
had
it
on
the
taste
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
was
how
much
more
carbonation
there
was
on
the
taste
than
what
i
could
see
in
the
glass
the
next
thing
that
hit
me
was
that
this
tasted
exactly
like
a
liquid
watermelon
jolly
rancher
to
me
this
was
completely
saturated
with
lots
of
artificial
watermelon
which
wasnt
all
that
pleasant
after
that
i
really
didnt
get
anything
else
any
other
flavors
were
completely
hidden
by
the
watermelon
the
finish
was
quick
again
with
watermelon
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
much
morei
guess
my
tastes
have
changed
i
would
not
rush
back
to
have
this
o
a
great
summer
beer
overall
it
is
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
one
was
plenty
cant
imagine
drinking
more
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
summer
brew
that
may
not
stand
out
in
a
crowd
but
is
a
good
beer
for
a
day
at
the
lake
watermelon
beer
what
will
they
think
of
next
very
little
head
that
lasted
a
very
short
time
i
personally
could
not
detect
any
discernible
smell
however
the
taste
was
exactly
as
advertised
by
the
name
resheshing
crisp
watermelon
dominates
i
like
its
uniqueness
hey
does
drinking
this
count
as
a
serving
of
fruit
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
grain
yeast
spices
and
some
slightly
fruit
but
not
watermelon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
mild
watermelon
flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
refreshing
but
the
watermelon
presence
is
mild
and
hard
to
pick
out
in
my
opinion
o
i
expected
a
lacklusterlight
bodied
overly
fruity
overly
sweet
beer
and
what
i
got
was
a
decent
summer
beer
would
buy
again
for
the
pool
or
the
beach
o
since
i
think
they
are
trying
to
replicate
the
experience
of
biting
into
a
piece
of
watermelon
as
thats
exactly
what
this
tastes
like
its
not
bad
but
as
an
actual
wheat
beer
its
not
very
good
i
dont
mind
fruit
in
beer
but
this
is
more
beer
trying
to
taste
like
fruit
than
it
is
fruit
trying
to
accentuate
the
flavors
of
a
beer
ill
give
it
points
for
being
refreshing
and
having
a
rather
nice
watermelon
flavor
but
its
not
something
i
would
reach
for
if
i
wanted
a
beer
cloudy
pale
gold
fluid
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
real
lace
smell
is
wheaty
with
good
amounts
of
twang
and
yeast
fruitiness
a
dry
crisp
cereal
graininess
flavor
is
just
short
of
the
next
score
for
me
full
bodied
wheat
core
with
a
perfect
amount
of
watermelon
juicy
body
and
a
dry
tart
finish
that
makes
it
a
superb
quencher
finish
has
a
bit
of
rind
and
artful
hop
balance
that
is
mild
yet
firm
this
beer
is
actually
a
delicately
complex
brew
crisp
feel
is
gently
carbonated
lending
to
a
great
drinkability
and
refreshing
character
one
of
my
new
summer
favorites
and
a
good
choice
for
the
adventurous
and
open
palate
tasted
good
with
normal
wheat
beer
taste
up
front
followed
by
the
watermelon
flavor
leaves
not
so
good
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
below
average
fruit
beer
seems
too
artificial
this
is
so
much
better
than
last
years
can
that
i
had
the
cooked
vegetable
isnt
even
a
memory
i
would
like
this
to
have
a
little
more
interesting
hop
profile
just
a
bit
of
nobles
maybe
but
for
what
it
is
im
very
impressed
o
not
horrible
but
not
special
by
any
means
almost
interesting
enough
to
seek
out
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
another
at
best
a
novelty
but
not
enough
character
to
be
good
one
recommendable
for
the
summer
months
definitely
a
nice
treat
for
a
hot
day
and
now
that
i
know
that
i
can
get
it
in
cans
itll
likely
come
with
me
to
the
next
bbq
i
attend
i
would
not
get
this
again
final
thoughts
this
was
an
average
beer
i
could
see
myself
having
it
again
at
a
backyard
bbq
or
summer
get
together
as
far
as
summer
seasonals
go
its
better
than
most
its
just
complex
enough
to
make
it
interesting
but
not
near
enough
to
make
it
exceptional
o
borderline
between
3
5
and
4
for
me
but
i
think
in
the
end
this
is
one
of
the
few
fruitbased
brews
that
i
can
finish
a
sixpack
of
bonus
points
for
not
being
a
berry
of
some
kind
o
refreshing
decent
summer
beer
but
thats
about
it
o
i
love
how
they
incorporated
the
watermelon
into
the
beer
and
it
fits
perfectly
it
is
a
nice
summer
wheat
beer
however
i
do
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
body
to
it
which
make
this
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
out
there
happy
to
see
the
experimentation
with
the
new
fruit
flavors
and
i
think
it
pays
off
o
better
than
other
watermelon
beers
i
have
tasted
but
still
strange
to
taste
watermelon
in
my
beer
average
fruit
wheat
not
boring
just
faulty
execution

a

you
get

with
an

is
actually
welcome
for
how
it

creates

theres
a

more
than
wheat

theres
an

added

at

might

here

it
but
its
unflawed
not
entirely
without
appeal
well
done
21st
amendment
and
thank
you
overall
im
still
searching
for
a
quality
fruit
beer
not
sure
if
ill
ever
find
a
real
good
one
but
for
some
reason
i
keep
trying
somebody
please
stop
me
o
certainly
the
best
watermelon
beer
that
i
have
tried
as
it
is
not
overly
sweet
and
does
not
taste
like
a
jolly
rancher
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
but
im
not
sure
it
would
be
a
sessionable
beer
for
me
just
not
a
flavor
profile
that
i
loved
would
be
good
on
a
real
hop
summer
day
hell
or
high
watermelon
poursa
somewhat
hazy
golden
yellow
three
or
so
fingers
of
white
foam
cap
the
beer
but
it
all
fades
quickly
and
quietly
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
a
jolly
rancher
watermelon
type
aroma
to
it
but
theres
also
another
smell
that
i
cant
quite
place
but
it
definitely
doesnt
belong
this
is
quite
simply
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
the
flavor
is
what
id
imagine
it
would
taste
like
if
you
let
the
leftover
milk
from
a
bowl
of
cereal
sit
out
for
a
day
and
then
tried
to
drink
it
the
body
has
a
weird
creaminess
to
it
only
highlighting
the
awful
taste
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
if
i
ever
did
a
video
review
of
hell
or
high
watermelon
it
would
probably
end
up
a
bit
like
the
i
award
you
zero
points
may
god
have
mercy
on
your
soul
speech
from
billy
madison
originally
reviewed
07062011
no
thanks
pass
on
this
one
o
im
really
disappointed
im
going
to
chalk
this
one
up
to
not
travelling
well
and
hopefully
try
it
again
someday
it
cost
me
less
than
two
bucks
so
im
not
disappointed
with
the
price
fallout
for
what
it
is
its
refreshing
fruity
and
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
before
it
takes
a
little
while
to
understand
it
and
enjoy
it
but
its
one
of
the
most
innovative
beers
ive
had
overall
between
this
and
abitas
strawberry
harvest
im
finding
more
fruit
beers
that
i
like
these
are
not
pumped
with
artificial
flavors
that
overpower
the
beer
the
watermelon
in
this
beer
is
so
subtle
that
it
could
easily
be
overlooked
if
your
not
thinking
about
the
flavors
once
you
start
to
really
dig
into
the
beer
the
watermelon
comes
out
of
hiding
and
compliments
the
wheat
very
nicely
normally
i
like
most
beers
from
21st
amendment
but
this
one
was
a
disappointment
o
this
one
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
is
a
little
more
complex
than
i
would
have
expected
but
it
still
bores
me
however
i
will
say
that
it
is
probably
the
best
watermelon
beer
ive
ever
had
but
ive
only
had
three
at
least
the
watermelon
tastes
fairly
natural
this
is
a
very
popular
beer
with
new
to
craft
drinkers
my
brother
swears
by
it
and
he
is
a
bmc
guy
so
i
guess
there
is
some
appeal
to
the
non
beer
geek
to
seek
this
out
with
the
watermelon
addition
i
need
to
try
this
from
a
can
but
my
draft
score
will
remain
overall
very
nice
effort
from
21st
amendment
as
always
i
love
their
cans
for
convienence
sake
an
easy
drinking
beer
when
you
want
something
just
a
little
different
if
you
are
looking
for
huge
depth
and
complexity
this
beer
is
not
for
you
if
judged
for
what
it
is
it
deserves
a
try
this
is
a
light
easy
drinking
beer
its
not
very
sweet
and
the
watermelon
doesnt
really
shine
through
its
drinkability
though
makes
it
a
refreshing
summer
beer
if
you
live
somewhere
that
gets
hot
and
want
a
different
refreshing
beer
give
it
a
try
bottom
line
if
you
like
wheat
beers
and
you
like
watermelon
this
is
it
worth
the
10
spot
for
the
six
o
definitely
a
nice
summer
brew
refreshing
and
relatively
low
on
the
abv
allows
one
to
kick
a
few
of
back
beneath
the
sun
o
a
really
interesting
beer
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
but
man
the
watermelon
really
is
something
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
i
could
only
really
have
one
or
two
very
rare
is
the
occasion
where
i
cannot
finish
a
beer
but
i
had
to
move
on
after
about
half
im
surprised
i
made
it
that
far
my
friend
and
i
trading
various
upsetting
facial
expressions
choking
it
down
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
was
going
on
with
this
beer
vomit
it
reminded
me
of
vomit
vile
repulsive
stuff
got
this
on
a
recommendation
of
a
friend
and
decided
to
pick
some
up
try
it
and
drop
a
review
on
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
head
is
thin
white
bubbly
and
gone
very
quickly
smell
is
of
a
standard
beer
variety
with
a
slight
sweetness
would
not
pick
out
watermelon
here
if
it
wasnt
on
the
can
taste
is
not
very
pleasant
slightly
sour
but
not
much
there
really
again
in
searching
for
the
watermelon
flavor
i
liken
it
to
a
watermelon
that
just
never
got
sweet
guess
that
can
be
expected
from
a
fruit
that
can
either
be
really
great
or
really
uneventful
was
kinda
surprised
because
previous
reviews
had
mentioned
an
artificial
flavor
of
watermelon
and
i
just
dont
taste
it
might
actually
make
it
more
enjoyable
canned
in
412
for
not
very
old
either
only
like
3
weeks
cant
say
ill
be
going
back
for
this
one
overall
not
for
everyone
but
it
is
as
advertised
if
the
watermelon
flavor
appeals
to
you
it
might
be
worth
having
a
can
on
a
hot
day
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
summer
beer
refreshing
crisp
sweet
perfect
for
session
drinking
mowing
the
lawn
lounging
around
getting
sunburn
on
the
lawn
i
thought
about
just
dumping
it
but
it
was
all
i
had
so
after
thinking
long
and
hard
i
remembered
that
if
you
hold
your
nose
you
cant
really
taste
what
is
in
your
mouth
it
worked
i
got
it
down
fast
this
is
nasty
shit
i
wish
i
could
rate
it
even
lower
im
glad
i
tried
it
it
delivers
as
promised
but
this
wont
be
repeat
for
me
ill
finish
the
six
pack
as
this
meets
my
summer
profile
of
preferring
lighter
brews
at
first
i
opened
the
can
poured
it
in
to
a
glass
and
right
off
the
bat
ya
can
smell
melon
rind
i
thought
o
no
this
is
going
to
be
bad
but
as
it
turned
out
this
is
my
new
best
summer
beer
now
the
taste
is
odd
very
odd
corn
and
watermelon
i
never
thought
id
like
it
but
i
really
do
if
it
didnt
smell
like
hell
itd
be
perfect
theres
a
nice
balance
of
fruitiness
from
the
watermelon
but
a
definite
beer
base
interesting
to
say
the
least
d
this
would
certainly
make
for
some
tasty
outside
summer
drinking
beer
i
would
also
imagine
that
it
works
well
with
a
watermelon
summer
salad
the
watermelon
flavor
is
neat
but
wouldnt
hate
for
some
more
body
to
back
it
o
not
terrible
but
not
the
most
appealing
beer
out
there
i
cold
with
a
meal
maybe
but
i
dont
need
to
drink
this
again
o
worst
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
id
like
to
say
its
the
watermelon
but
honestly
feel
it
is
just
a
poor
quality
beer
overall
and
yet
this
beer
is
somehow
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
ill
never
buy
it
again
but
id
probably
drink
it
if
offered
this
is
now
my
2nd
21st
amendment
beer
and
both
have
been
big
disappointments
dare
i
try
a
third
the
watermelon
flavor
is
more
authentic
that
i
expected
but
the
beer
overall
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
flavors
dont
blend
all
that
well
and
i
am
left
with
a
clash
between
yeast
and
fruit
mediumlight
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
however
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
one
again
the
easy
drinking
quenching
appeal
of
this
beer
is
overshadowed
by
an
unbalanced
and
lackluster
flavor
overall
yeah
its
a
novelty
wheat
beer
and
im
not
exactly
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
its
a
nice
crisy
beer
the
initial
smell
makes
it
seem
rather
bland
while
the
flavor
proves
that
there
it
does
have
something
worthwhile
to
offer
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
but
refreshing
and
perfect
hotdayin
the
sun
brew
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
a
weird
aroma
and
flavor
for
sure
finding
it
hard
to
finish
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
summer
months
a
little
too
expensive
tho
overall
ive
often
seen
this
sitting
on
the
shelves
and
being
kind
of
put
off
by
the
concept
of
a
watermelon
beer
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
a
pretty
tasty
light
wheat
beer
that
would
go
great
with
the
summer
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
the
watermelon
was
too
dominating
and
just
not
that
great
it
seemed
to
have
more
of
a
bitter
rind
vegetable
like
quality
to
it
that
i
didnt
care
for
a
little
metallic
as
well
not
something
id
want
to
try
again
overall
i
came
to
enjoy
this
beer
dont
plan
to
cuddle
with
it
as
it
will
go
flat
quick
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
summer
day
a
little
pat
on
the
back
worth
a
try
if
you
like
lighter
beer
poured
from
a
can
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
opaque
pale
yellowgold
coloring
with
no
head
whatsoever
aromas
of
tangy
sweet
watermelon
and
toasted
grains
flavors
are
light
and
sweet
with
a
strong
watermelon
character
on
the
forward
tongue
that
gives
you
a
sugary
tart
profile
atop
the
toasted
grain
backbone
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
quick
with
a
strong
watermelon
character
and
tangy
feel
crisp
light
finish
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
great
on
a
hot
day
also
goes
well
with
a
wedge
of
watermelon
as
we
originally
had
it
at
21st
amendment
in
sanfran
final
thoughts
this
american
wheat
is
not
worth
buying
twice
its
akward
flavor
is
hard
to
drink
let
alone
5
more
keep
trying
21
amendment
it
could
potentially
be
a
good
beer
i
was
in
ohio
and
we
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
cans
from
local
store
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
almost
like
a
farmhouse
cider
tiny
white
bubbly
head
with
no
lacing
there
was
definitely
some
melon
in
the
aroma
and
also
in
the
taste
malt
and
wheat
balanced
the
beer
in
both
smeel
and
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
probably
better
served
in
the
summer
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
not
buy
again
overall
a
nice
light
summer
beer
its
not
overly
flavorful
or
sweet
but
has
a
nice
real
watermelon
flavor
maybe
a
little
more
fruit
flavor
would
help
this
out
some
but
none
the
less
is
a
enjoyable
beer
for
what
it
is
this
is
totally
not
a
midwinter
drink
but
id
probably
appreciate
it
on
the
beach
in
the
summer
a
little
bit
too
light
of
a
wheat
beer
but
its
not
terrible
either
i
say
try
this
one
if
you
can
i
will
admit
i
was
not
excited
about
this
but
it
could
be
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
with
on
a
summer
afternoon
overall
this
is
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
an
interesting
take
on
a
beer
but
not
something
i
think
ill
seek
out
again
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
typically
with
fruit
beers
youll
get
something
overly
sweet
to
the
point
that
it
just
tastes
fake
especially
with
watermelon
beers
they
often
just
taste
like
drinking
a
jolly
rancher
surprisingly
that
was
the
not
the
case
here
and
while
there
was
a
ton
of
watermelon
flavor
it
really
wasnt
that
overly
sweet
syrup
flavor
pretty
good
id
say
not
something
id
get
all
the
time
but
i
did
enjoy
it
would
not
buy
again
drain
pour
in
the
end
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
wouldnt
totally
dismiss
this
beer
as
it
is
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
however
its
not
a
beer
that
id
find
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
the
time
it
does
sort
of
scream
to
be
bought
the
night
before
a
day
of
yard
work
overall
watermelon
is
a
difficult
beer
to
get
right
and
these
guys
certainly
made
a
good
example
of
it
yeah
the
taste
isnt
going
to
taste
like
biting
into
a
real
watermelon
watermelon
itself
has
very
little
flavor
other
that
sugar
watermelon
flavoring
is
still
delicious
though
and
being
a
big
fan
of
it
i
found
this
beer
to
be
great
light
in
body
i
actually
thought
the
carbonation
was
pretty
decent
i
might
have
preferred
a
little
less
carbonation
only
because
i
felt
that
it
added
to
the
sodalike
nature
of
this
beer
enjoyable
in
some
situations
but
definitely
not
a
staple
in
my
fridge
notes
light
mouthfeel
which
i
think
could
have
used
more
carbonation
i
will
admit
to
approaching
this
beer
with
some
trepidation
watermelon
flavored
beer
the
thougth
invoked
a
shudder
but
i
forged
on
nonetheless
i
was
pleasantly
surpised
at
how
deftly
the
watermelon
aspect
was
handled
rather
than
the
jolly
rancher
monstrosity
i
expected
the
watermelon
note
was
quite
subtile
just
barely
there
in
the
background
of
an
otherwise
quite
clean
and
light
wheat
some
citrus
balanced
well
with
the
melon
and
there
was
a
hint
of
fruity
perfume
in
the
aftertaste
not
something
could
see
myself
ordering
on
any
sort
of
regular
basis
but
an
interesting
endeavor
by
the
brewery
o
this
was
a
little
too
soda
like
wouldnt
buy
this
again
i
can
respect
21st
for
trying
this
though
o
interesting
idea
but
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
its
executing
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
or
try
again
o
this
beer
delivers
what
it
says
it
would
perfect
for
a
hot
day
as
it
is
quite
refreshing
not
a
brew
i
would
certainly
seek
out
but
it
was
enjoyable
some
watermelon
flavor
though
accompanied
by
a
bland
watery
character
more
like
the
white
rind
than
the
sweet
red
fruit
light
astringency
the
mouthfeel
is
basically
nonexistent
probably
not
something
id
revisit
personally
cool
new
can
design
though
m
light
and
drinkable
with
no
real
punch
just
an
easy
summer
beer
not
only
is
this
a
terrible
wheat
beer
it
is
a
bad
beer
with
artificial
tasting
watermelon
flavor
in
it
i
never
pour
out
a
beer
if
i
can
choke
it
down
this
one
got
dumped
after
one
painful
gulp
usually
i
can
find
something
positive
in
most
beers
but
i
am
drawing
a
blank
with
this
one
if
it
werent
for
the
watermelon
this
beer
would
be
as
exciting
as
bathwater
served
from
can
into
a
unibroue
la
fin
du
monde
tulip
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
fruit
and
watermelon
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
nothing
too
exciting
if
im
completely
honest
i
mainly
got
this
one
for
the
name
the
watermelon
was
definitely
present
but
really
didnt
blend
well
with
the
other
flavors
going
on
here
on
the
aroma
i
was
unable
to
isolate
the
watermelon
but
it
definitely
came
through
on
the
flavor
worth
trying
to
say
that
you
did
but
that
is
about
it
in
my
personal
opinion
o
the
beer
definitely
goes
down
very
easy
but
has
an
unremarkable
taste
it
would
be
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
are
just
looking
for
a
cold
beer
but
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
light
and
incredibly
refreshing
i
think
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
very
light
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
great
poolside
or
with
the
lawnmower
i
like
it
o
perfect
summer
beer
for
the
pool
or
beach
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
to
enjoy
labor
day
at
the
beach
with
college
football
its
great
to
be
an
american
overall
an
interesting
brew
something
off
in
the
scent
and
a
little
two
pungent
of
watermelon
flavor
upfront
o
watermelon
wheat
is
a
nice
summer
beer
and
it
deviates
from
the
normal
fruit
beers
with
the
addition
of
watermelon
and
besides
you
cant
be
it
being
in
a
can
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
great
brew
to
grill
out
with
very
refreshing
and
a
cool
concept
i
havent
seen
in
many
other
beers
i
for
one
ambitiously
declare
this
one
of
my
5
beers
of
the
summer
and
as
the
last
shipment
has
arrived
at
the
store
i
realize
that
i
have
survived
my
first
summer
in
ny
and
the
leaves
are
about
to
change
d
a
summer
refresher
for
sure
a
light
fruit
flavor
on
a
light
and
muted
wheat
beer
a
really
well
done
fruit
beer
overall
and
is
there
another
watermelon
wheat
out
there
sure
it
is
a
bit
onesided
and
even
gimmicky
but
every
time
i
try
one
of
these
i
am
struck
by
how
distinctly
it
does
taste
of
watermelon
oits
not
awful
but
im
not
sure
it
works
all
that
well
the
sweet
watermelon
flavor
gets
lost
with
the
wheaty
taste
and
it
seems
more
tart
than
it
should
be
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
more
of
it
the
pour
is
a
translucent
hay
color
with
about
a
half
inch
of
bubbly
white
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
is
perhaps
the
most
offputting
part
for
me
for
some
reason
i
cant
detect
anything
past
a
terrible
strong
curdled
milk
scent
i
cant
even
find
the
damn
watermelon
in
the
nose
i
brace
for
the
taste
ah
found
the
watermelon
there
is
a
dominating
yet
artificial
watermelon
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
jolly
rancher
or
some
other
sugary
candy
an
odd
milk
like
flavor
sits
between
the
melon
and
a
faint
wheat
base
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
lively
from
the
carbonation
nothing
spectacular
as
it
is
a
bit
thin
i
will
be
avoiding
this
in
the
future
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
a
watermelon
slice
on
the
glass
aroma
is
lots
of
watermelon
flavor
is
wheaty
with
you
guessed
it
watermelon
pretty
sour
and
almost
cidery
on
the
finish
light
on
the
palate
refreshing
but
a
little
offbalance
in
my
opinion
a
decent
fruit
beer
but
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
worth
trying
once
and
i
hear
its
better
on
tap
than
in
the
can
while
not
a
bad
beer
overall
the
focus
on
the
watermelon
as
guest
starring
ingredient
has
predictably
feeble
results
an
echo
of
an
already
delicate
flavour
doesnt
add
up
to
strong
memorable
flavours
that
said
agreeable
enough
for
days
like
this
30
degrees
where
ease
of
drinkability
and
cute
advertising
rule
omight
make
a
good
beer
to
have
occasionally
on
a
hot
day
but
i
cant
get
them
around
here
so
it
will
be
very
occasionally
for
me
othis
is
the
perfect
beer
and
my
goto
for
a
brew
to
take
with
me
to
south
beach
on
the
weekends
overall
though
there
are
better
wheat
beers
out
there
i
would
recommend
it
for
what
it
is
something
i
will
pick
up
again
aromas
are
good
some
watermelon
and
other
citrus
with
a
little
yeasty
note
mild
and
smooth
on
the
palate
not
overly
complex
but
enjoyable
much
more
natural
and
balanced
than
most
commercialized
fruit
beers
d
very
drinkable
the
watermelon
flavor
is
very
nice
but
it
just
needed
a
bit
more
flavor
and
body
felt
refreshing
but
just
a
bit
empty
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
although
the
watermelon
borders
on
jolly
rancheresque
artificial
sweetness
after
a
while
o
ok
paradoxically
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
not
because
it
resembled
anything
i
would
call
craft
beer
i
would
consider
this
nice
and
interesting
lawnmower
beer
sort
of
like
the
pleasure
one
would
get
drinking
a
pabst
or
natty
boh
but
with
watermelonwhich
aint
a
bad
thing
d
overall
it
did
drink
real
easy
not
overly
sweet
and
could
really
enjoy
some
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
poolside
it
was
a
decent
fruit
style
beer
12oz
can
1
99
hazy
yellow
color
looks
murky
with
a
pillowtop
head
smells
faintly
of
watermelon
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
heavy
watermelon
juice
so
much
so
that
it
almost
felt
artificially
flavored
but
i
liked
it
anyway
for
me
this
would
be
a
good
hot
weather
beer
but
not
a
session
beer
since
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
o
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
anytime
soon
nor
recommending
this
to
other
i
usually
enjoy
their
beers
but
this
one
is
a
miss
kind
of
an
average
beer
o
nice
an
crisp
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
summer
time
and
this
terrible
heat
wave
we
are
in
easily
could
enjoy
one
of
these
after
cutting
the
grass
or
while
cooking
out
or
any
other
summertime
activities
as
an
afterthought
its
cool
flavor
paired
really
well
with
spicy
mexican
food
i
ate
after
my
initial
tastes
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
mainly
wheat
but
i
also
get
a
nice
bit
of
light
watermelon
the
flavor
is
wheat
juicy
watermelon
and
a
light
bit
of
tartness
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
mouthfeel
a
nicely
done
fruit
beer
that
doesnt
taste
artificial
or
overpower
you
with
sweetness
o
interesting
i
bought
a
single
can
of
this
and
it
will
be
the
last
can
i
buy
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
like
i
said
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
in
general
and
i
dont
really
see
the
gain
in
putting
watermelon
in
beer
hell
or
high
watermelon
holds
a
light
body
dry
mouthfeel
and
moderate
semispicy
carbonation
the
clean
crisp
authentic
watermelon
flavor
is
immediately
present
at
the
forefront
and
fades
into
a
lighter
sweet
melon
tang
while
touches
of
grainy
wheat
and
malt
follow
through
to
the
end
the
profile
of
this
beer
overall
is
very
light
but
that
doesnt
keep
it
from
being
the
perfect
thirst
quencher
especially
when
its
115º
outside
as
much
as
i
disagree
with
the
current
stereotypes
of
women
and
fruit
beer
i
think
that
this
could
be
an
awesome
first
step
into
the
craft
beer
world
for
both
men
and
women
who
are
still
trying
to
become
interested
and
want
to
ease
themselves
in
to
those
who
have
bought
a
6
pack
and
dont
enjoy
it
save
one
for
a
bbq
and
give
it
another
shot
for
low
bitternessrefreshing
summer
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
overall
this
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
a
refreshing
summer
beer
that
proves
itself
as
an
ideal
pool
lounging
candidate
that
your
girlfriend
probably
wont
argue
with
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
wheat
beers
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
very
pale
golden
with
a
few
thin
strands
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
a
reasonable
head
formed
upon
pour
but
quickly
left
just
a
thin
layer
that
clung
just
a
bit
to
the
sides
aroma
was
a
bit
off
putting
smelled
slightly
sour
with
a
hint
of
pickles
and
grain
taste
was
of
watered
down
watermelon
bubble
gum
or
diluted
sorbet
not
a
natural
flavor
but
one
that
was
easily
identifiable
felt
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
didnt
coat
at
all
and
had
just
a
tad
of
carbonation
while
drinking
overall
was
a
blah
beer
might
be
fun
to
bust
out
as
a
gimmick
while
friends
are
over
at
a
bbq
mid
summer
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
o
not
a
very
good
beer
its
a
weird
flavor
that
i
didnt
expect
and
really
doesnt
deliver
the
promised
watermelon
taste
i
find
it
extremely
strange
that
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
sellers
at
winking
lizard
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
and
will
stick
to
other
offerings
from
21st
amendment
dthe
former
drinkablility
category
i
actually
would
buy
this
again
it
is
not
great
but
it
is
refreshing
and
unusual
i
dig
offbeat
stuff
and
this
certainly
is
that
low
in
abv
to
pound
down
in
the
summer
heat
i
like
a
summer
refresher
that
lets
me
drink
more
of
it
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
id
go
back
to
i
prefer
a
lighter
wheat
beer
for
a
summer
seasonal
and
im
not
a
fan
of
watermelon
the
fruit
so
watermelon
the
beer
probably
isnt
for
me
either
still
its
an
interesting
and
commendable
experiment
overall
this
one
is
ok
inoffensive
and
some
good
qualities
to
it
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
go
out
of
ones
way
to
acquire
i
might
buy
it
to
diversify
my
beer
menu
at
a
cookout
but
thats
about
it
m
nothing
special

tiny

really
picking
up

as

as

some

maybe
picking
up
the
water
melon
in
the
taste
right
away
and
its
not
candy
type
but
real
watermelon
after
that
its
just
wheatiness
very
simple
thin
mouthfeel
but
you
cant
hold
that
against
it
per
style
overall
very
dissapointed
very
very
boring
even
in
the
heat
this
beer
is
a
unique
take
on
a
wheatcentric
beer
by
adding
watermelon
something
of
which
ive
never
seen
done
before
and
it
works
quite
well
nothing
seems
overpowering
but
the
aromas
could
use
some
work
as
could
the
flavor
profile
in
the
taste
id
like
to
see
the
watermelon
stay
relevant
throughout
but
a
nice
base
for
a
flavored
wheat
beer
o
will
not
be
drinking
again
i
like
21st
amendment
but
this
is
just
not
very
good
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
see
how
this
could
be
a
polarizing
beer
o
great
fruit
beer
for
a
hot
day
im
not
one
to
love
fruit
beers
but
this
was
decent
per
style
i
would
buy
this
again
for
its
purpose
not
to
mention
the
girlfriend
liked
as
well
im
a
bit
sick
of
all
fruit
beers
getting
horrible
scores
just
because
it
isnt
the
most
favored
style
first
this
is
a
perfect
combination
of
a
fruit
and
beer
the
soft
watermelon
hints
pair
perfectly
with
the
wheat
style
it
is
amazingly
refreshing
during
a
hot
day
or
while
peddling
to
a
brewery
great
level
of
carbonation
too
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
one
watermelon
how
refreshing
poured
into
a
glass
a
large
head
erupts
and
loiters
for
a
bit
but
leaves
without
a
trace
a
nice
hazy
golden
wheat
body
the
beer
has
got
some
yeasty
and
bitter
rind
aromas
going
on
whereas
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
nice
watermelon
flavor
its
not
hard
to
pick
out
this
is
apparently
a
watermelon
beer
and
a
good
one
at
that
its
got
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
drinking
at
4
9
i
feel
like
ive
been
calling
a
lot
of
beers
refreshing
and
im
gonna
call
this
one
as
well
good
beer
yay
summer
fruit
beers
can
be
really
hit
and
miss
but
this
one
works
for
me
the
watermelon
is
subtle
but
tasty
nice
grainy
wheat
and
sweet
malt
and
crisp
my
local
bottle
shop
brew
in
south
philly
has
sixpacks
of
this
for
12
and
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
at
least
a
few
more
this
summer
my
first
thought
was
this
is
probably
going
to
be
sweet
and
nasty
but
i
give
credit
to
21st
in
that
they
made
the
watermelon
work
well
with
the
style
the
nose
is
watermelon
but
the
taste
is
wheat
with
only
a
hint
of
the
fruit
actually
finishes
nicely
with
a
smooth
grainy
taste
with
that
watermelon
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
could
have
been
a
disaster
but
it
actually
works
overall
this
beer
is
right
i
wouldnt
reach
for
two
in
a
row
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
think
i
will
have
another
one
in
the
future
d
once
you
get
past
the
aroma
theres
a
decent
beer
waiting
still
not
something
id
want
to
bother
with
again
markedly
inferior
to
the
watermelon
lambic
hombrew
someone
brought
to
rbwg
2010
it
was
also
like
a
watery
pale
ale
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
behind
it
but
the
sweetness
was
watermelon
the
carbonation
was
more
under
control
but
the
watermelon
was
a
bit
too
cloyingly
sweet
unlike
similarly
disfavored
beers
like
deschutes
twilight
ale
its
not
as
drinkable
as
similar
beers
just
due
to
the
cloying
sweetness
still
remember
the
first
time
i
had
this
at
the
annual
obf
where
for
god
knows
what
reason
it
remains
a
perennial
favorite
and
how
much
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
it
given
its
popularity
and
all
the
hype
surrounding
it
i
was
absolutely
stunned
by
what
i
tasted
or
should
i
say
by
what
i
didnt
taste
and
ended
up
dumping
my
glass
after
the
second
or
third
sip
ive
tried
it
on
several
more
occcasions
since
then
on
the
off
chance
that
maybe
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
palate
or
id
just
gotten
an
unusually
bland
batch
no
such
luck
this
beer
is
consistently
bland
boring
and
basically
tasteless
the
ultimate
gimmick
beer
at
least
in
my
book
o
this
has
slowly
become
my
favorite
tubing
down
the
river
beer
by
beating
out
butternuts
hefe
the
can
makes
it
portable
while
the
lower
abv
makes
it
great
for
having
a
bunch
while
floating
and
staying
coordinated
enough
to
scale
the
muddy
hill
back
to
the
car
i
wouldnt
get
this
for
much
of
any
thing
else
except
maybe
a
hot
day
on
a
boat
or
maybe
a
company
picnic
o
if
i
was
looking
for
something
to
have
multiple
glassescans
of
while
spending
some
time
outdoors
in
the
warm
weather
this
would
absolutely
be
my
choice
if
i
could
only
get
more
of
it
in
tn
i
definitely
recommend
it
as
a
summertime
brew
overall
its
a
beer
thats
not
noteworthy
other
than
the
cool
can
o
not
a
good
beer
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
good
beer
easy
to
get
down
but
pretty
much
of
nonconsequence
food
pairings
veggies
salad
grilled
chicken
grilled
pork
light
body
cheeses
o
not
my
thing
not
enough
punch
its
bland
and
clean
so
it
may
appeal
to
people
who
like
lighter
tasting
beers
hazy
light
golden
in
body
with
fading
white
head
smells
of
weak
watermelon
wheat
and
light
floral
notes
tastes
of
light
floral
wheat
watermelon
in
the
background
some
light
grains
and
a
dry
ending
having
the
watermelon
as
an
undertone
makes
for
a
refreshing
session
medium
carbonation
with
light
body
cloying
mouthfeel
perfect
for
mdw
down
the
shore
body
is
semi
crisp
with
a
lightish
medium
body
a
bit
flat
on
carbonation
for
a
wheat
based
fruit
beer
which
in
actuality
seems
right
on
course
with
many
of
the
other
fruit
based
wheat
beer
that
get
cranked
out
by
some
of
the
big
macro
breweries
and
micros
as
well
nothing
id
seek
out
really
other
then
trying
the
hollow
watermelon
trick
at
a
big
summer
picnic
or
party
i
like
fruit
beers
but
not
this
one
hell
or
high
watermelon
wheat
may
be
the
perfect
summer
beer
light
and
refreshing
with
a
subtle
fruit
flavor
that
reminds
of
fourth
of
july
picnics
o
i
have
enjoyed
all
21st
amendment
offerings
until
this
swing
and
a
miss
hell
or
high
watermelon
is
a
unique
beer
in
many
ways
not
excellent
but
not
horrible
its
drinkable
and
i
can
see
how
it
could
be
thirstquenching
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
can
see
what
the
brewers
were
trying
to
achieve
and
while
it
is
decent
i
think
there
is
room
for
improvement
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
but
not
crazy
not
very
much
to
say
about
this
one
d
overall
a
decent
beer
probably
not
one
id
drink
again
but
not
the
killshot
i
had
suspected
it
might
be
3
i
expected
much
better
and
really
didnt
care
for
the
mouthfeel
not
really
something
i
would
get
again
ooverall
this
a
decent
brew
i
can
totally
see
myself
drinking
this
during
the
summer
months
with
a
hot
dog
in
one
hand
and
this
beer
in
the
other
watching
the
red
sox
notes
hmmm
the
poorest
from
what
i
have
had
from
21st
amendment
entry
level
casual
quaff
under
the
scorching
sun
not
a
terrible
offering
but
having
a
choice
i
would
stay
away
from
this
one
they
can
do
much
better
than
this
pours
a
very
nice
looking
white
one
and
a
half
finger
head
i
can
slightly
hear
it
fizzing
though
which
isnt
a
great
sign
its
mostly
all
small
bubbles
and
it
has
kind
of
a
pillowy
look
to
it
its
not
hanging
around
too
long
but
better
than
some
beers
i
supposed
it
has
decent
lacing
the
body
is
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
color
id
like
it
to
be
a
little
cloudier
to
be
honest
but
its
pretty
legit
i
cant
see
through
it
at
all
overall
its
a
decent
look
the
lacing
could
be
better
and
the
head
could
have
lasted
longer
but
for
a
wheat
beer
its
not
bad
i
get
two
main
things
on
the
smell
the
first
is
watermelon
and
the
second
is
cheap
beer
its
not
an
overpowering
watermelon
smell
and
that
is
good
a
lot
of
these
wheat
beers
overdo
it
with
the
fruit
and
this
clearly
doesnt
the
cheap
beer
smell
worries
me
because
its
a
pretty
clear
smell
not
much
question
about
what
im
smelling
it
smells
refreshing
and
i
doubt
ill
dislike
it
but
that
cheap
beer
smell
may
cause
some
problems
on
the
taste
the
taste
is
good
its
mostly
just
watermelon
though
not
much
else
to
it
the
good
news
is
that
it
doesnt
taste
like
cheap
beer
just
a
one
sided
beer
you
do
get
a
little
bit
of
a
can
taste
to
it
which
really
pisses
me
off
because
all
these
micro
breweries
promise
that
even
though
they
put
their
beers
in
cans
it
wont
taste
metallicy
well
this
does
just
slightly
but
it
does
maybe
the
metallic
taste
was
the
cheap
beer
smell
i
was
picking
up
on
the
watermelon
taste
is
good
they
for
sure
didnt
overdo
it
with
the
watermelon
taste
and
thats
good
frankly
id
like
a
little
more
but
in
these
fruit
beers
its
better
to
have
less
than
more
because
some
breweries
go
nuts
with
fruit
the
wheat
aspect
is
a
little
different
i
mean
it
looks
like
a
wheat
beer
but
it
real
doesnt
feel
like
a
wheat
beer
that
much
there
is
a
tiny
wheat
feel
but
for
the
most
part
its
too
thin
so
considering
that
the
mouthfeel
isnt
all
that
great
the
carbonation
is
right
but
they
skimped
out
on
the
wheat
in
a
wheat
beer
so
yeah
the
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
very
well
overall
on
this
beer
its
a
good
beer
its
has
some
areas
that
could
for
sure
be
improved
on
like
the
headlacing
and
the
wheat
but
overall
its
not
bad
its
very
tasty
and
refreshing
can
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
surprisingly
the
nose
has
decently
strong
notes
of
watermelon
with
some
mild
wheat
notes
as
well
no
alcohol
or
hops
notes
to
mention
medium
mouthfeel
starts
slightly
sweet
with
a
building
watermelon
flavor
and
other
melon
refreshing
to
drink
minimal
lace
ever
so
slight
bitterness
lingers
but
miniscule
overall
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
interesting
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
think
id
like
it
on
a
hot
day
o
excellent
sessional
summer
beer
hangin
at
the
lake
in
the
heat
whatever
taste
great
i
need
more
will
i
finish
the
six
pack
yes
will
i
buy
again
probably
not
overall
i
would
advise
against
this
beer
i
would
love
to
try
some
of
this
brewerys
other
offerings
as
i
have
heard
some
good
things
hopefully
this
wont
affect
my
perception
of
their
other
brews
pours
a
hazy
really
pale
yellow
with
a
onefinger
white
head
goes
quickly
with
no
lacing
not
a
great
smell
smells
tart
and
a
little
sour
hints
of
wheat
and
yeast
as
well
flavor
begins
with
some
light
wheat
flavor
before
a
pleasant
watermelon
and
honeydew
sweetness
rounds
out
this
simple
flavor
profile
really
refreshing
melon
flavor
nailed
it
without
making
it
taste
like
watermelon
juice
solid
fruit
beer
minus
the
offputting
aroma
o
i
like
21st
amendment
and
most
of
their
offerings
just
not
into
this
one
i
bought
a
6pack
and
thank
god
the
wife
likes
it
shell
be
drinking
the
rest
of
it
alone
i
definitely
could
have
pounded
my
way
through
this
can
but
i
decided
to
let
the
sink
handle
that
instead
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
far
and
away
from
the
best
in
the
end
the
smell
was
the
deciding
factor
for
me
poured
clear
golden
into
a
tumbler
big
white
foamy
head
that
dissipated
after
a
few
minutes
to
just
a
thin
layer
aroma
first
impression
was
stale
and
unimpressive
and
i
started
having
doubts
that
i
picked
up
a
bad
beer
then
i
took
a
sip
watermelon
very
distinct
very
fruity
but
not
overbearing
or
sickeningly
sweet
and
truly
watermelon
very
light
and
smooth
no
acidic
harshness
that
often
pervades
wheat
beers
light
body
easily
drinkable
great
summertime
beer
i
want
more
hand
carried
back
from
maryland
das
i
said
above
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
bc
i
had
wanted
to
for
a
while
i
didnt
finish
the
can
i
had
left
about
14
in
the
glass
i
generally
am
a
fan
of
21st
amendment
but
this
one
just
didnt
work
though
i
respect
the
effort
in
trying
to
brew
a
different
beer
o
its
interesting
doesnt
taste
too
great
i
have
tasted
a
number
of
excellent
21st
amendment
beers
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
couldnt
even
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
and
as
i
already
stated
this
felt
like
a
soda
or
a
mixer
that
id
pour
into
some
spirit
thankfully
i
couldnt
taste
any
of
the
can
in
the
beer
like
i
thought
and
im
sure
that
thats
a
prejudice
that
i
personally
need
to
overcome
that
being
said
this
beer
comes
up
short
and
if
i
wanted
something
on
a
hot
summer
day
id
choose
something
with
a
bit
more
haze
and
body
in
it
this
isnt
a
novelty
but
its
not
that
far
away
from
that
status
either
can
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
very
toasty
biscuity
aroma
with
a
fresh
whiff
of
melon
the
palate
carries
more
biscuity
malt
with
some
wheat
notes
and
distinct
but
subtle
watermelon
in
the
finish
not
especially
yeasty
or
wheaty
to
me
more
biscuity
and
even
a
toasty
mouthfeel
but
subtle
on
the
fruit
which
keeps
things
intriguing
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
very
different
in
a
good
way
but
not
enough
for
me
to
buy
again
overall
im
unimpressed
and
thomas
hookers
would
definitey
be
my
choice
given
the
option
o
nice
light
sweet
and
refreshing
this
is
the
first
watermelon
beer
ive
ever
had
the
color
was
hazy
and
yellow
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
had
the
natural
aroma
of
the
watermelon
the
flavor
was
a
little
of
te
light
side
it
wasnt
that
bad
but
i
think
that
if
a
watermelon
wedge
was
added
to
this
while
drinking
that
it
would
amp
this
brew
up
and
make
it
a
lot
better
o
while
im
not
that
into
fruit
beers
this
one
is
pretty
good
as
the
fruit
flavoring
isnt
overpowering
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
beer
as
the
weather
warms
up
worth
trying
sometime
if
you
see
it
pours
out
a
nice
gold
color
small
amount
of
head
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
bit
of
citrus
some
watermelon
rind
tastes
very
light
i
can
probably
drink
this
all
day
watermelon
flavor
a
bit
like
watermelon
jollyranchers
nice
amount
of
carbonation
definitely
refreshing
hopefully
my
future
posts
will
be
for
better
buys
pale
gold
with
almost
no
head
no
lace
dead
looking
watermelon
fruit
and
some
faint
wheat
on
the
nose
taste
is
mostly
watermelon
with
a
distinct
wheat
base
fruity
aftertaste
very
light
watery
mouth
overall
this
was
a
clunker
glad
i
only
have
a
6
pack
from
a
variety
case
those
will
tough
to
get
rid
of
d
couldnt
handle
a
few
sips
no
way
will
i
buy
this
again
d
on
a
hot
day
this
may
not
be
too
bad
not
really
my
thing
but
i
can
see
what
they
were
going
for
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
at
all
but
it
sure
is
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
but
thats
about
it
overall
this
was
a
fun
one
to
try
a
fun
one
to
tick
but
not
one
i
ever
want
again
d
very
refreshing
a
watermelony
flavoured
lighter
beer
great
for
summertime
looks
like
your
typical
light
beer
not
much
on
the
nose
still
its
enjoyable
d
if
this
is
your
thing
then
pretty
high
its
light
enough
in
body
and
abv
to
drink
a
few
probably
a
good
lawnmower
beer
not
really
my
thing
but
i
might
just
chalk
it
up
to
being
out
of
season
as
well
as
a
slightly
dated
can
d
if
i
were
in
the
caribbean
and
no
beer
was
around
except
for
this
and
bud
id
choose
this
otherwise
id
definitely
skip
it
drinkability
a
sad
attempt
at
a
wheat
beer
a
poorly
brewed
wheat
beer
with
some
watermelon
juice
added
is
not
a
good
mix
md
a
little
sticky
and
light
carbonation
on
the
tongue
sweet
i
wouldnt
really
want
more
than
one
of
these
despite
the
low
abv
pours
a
light
honey
gold
color
with
almost
a
greenish
hue
no
visibility
through
the
wheaty
cloud
a
white
head
soon
turns
into
a
ring
smell
is
remarkably
crisp
i
get
many
light
green
fruit
tones
like
pear
and
apple
and
some
light
grains
taste
is
very
bright
and
crisp
the
watermelon
really
serves
as
a
nice
backing
without
too
much
sweetness
and
just
a
little
tartness
finishes
dry
with
a
little
hops
bitterness
and
lingering
watermelon
sweetness
pretty
good
and
my
favorite
fruitadded
beer
ive
sampled
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
tasted
watered
down
and
that
may
have
been
the
best
part
of
it
i
dont
mean
to
be
cruel
but
so
far
on
this
site
it
had
a
b
someone
must
have
been
grading
on
a
curve
taste
wow
dissapointed
it
tastes
like
spinach
i
dont
know
if
this
is
an
old
can
or
what
but
i
feel
like
popeye
should
be
drinking
this
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
is
low
because
im
assuming
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
this
maybe
its
an
old
can
but
i
only
bought
it
about
a
month
ago
the
flavor
brings
an
initial
squirt
of
starburstlike
watermelon
flavor
but
its
very
artificial
and
doesnt
last
long
it
quickly
gives
way
to
stale
wheat
and
a
cooked
veggie
presence
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
thin
but
nicely
crisp
and
refreshing
per
the
style
overall
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
fruity
wheat
style
but
the
base
beer
is
lackluster
no
point
in
adding
watermelon
to
a
mediocre
wheat
beer
id
pass
on
this
next
time
but
it
was
worth
a
try
d
yuck
will
never
have
this
one
again
nothing
about
this
beer
works
for
me
i
was
turned
off
by
the
smell
and
the
taste
provided
exactly
what
the
smell
promised
an
undrinkable
beer
avoid
this
one
someone
sent
me
a
can
as
an
extra
from
the
west
coast
hey
its
an
extra
and
they
hadnt
thought
that
fruit
beers
are
not
normally
my
thing
pours
a
light
pinkish
tinge
colour
with
quick
fizzing
disapearing
head
mild
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
acceptable
for
a
few
gulps
light
mouthfeel
this
isnt
real
watermelon
put
in
the
tank
taste
is
basically
a
wheat
beer
with
not
much
watermelon
flavor
at
all
its
basically
your
standard
wheat
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
rich
and
creamy
quite
good
there
is
some
weird
off
taste
thats
not
great
but
overall
its
a
step
above
a
macro
quite
easy
drinking
i
had
this
beer
ontap
at
the
21st
amendment
brewery
in
san
francisco
i
had
it
during
the
summer
and
it
was
a
good
summer
beer
it
was
highly
drinkablevery
light
and
crisp
there
was
a
strong
aroma
of
watermelon
and
it
was
served
which
a
watermelon
wedge
on
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
cant
miss
the
watermelon
in
this
beer
drank
it
with
a
chunk
of
watermelon
in
it
too
very
drinkable
light
tasty
watermelon
but
its
hardly
a
beer
really
good
for
hot
sweaty
summer
days
but
i
prefer
some
more
body
nonetheless
it
tastes
great
just
very
light
drinkable
for
those
who
like
a
light
lagerlike
fruit
beer
d
it
goes
down
easy
enough
it
isnt
awful
but
it
isnt
complex
at
all
it
really
does
nothing
for
me
it
will
go
away
quickly
simply
because
it
doesnt
taste
bad
its
more
that
it
doesnt
taste
bad
than
it
tastes
good
very
average
and
boring
light
body
some
lingering
dryness
on
the
tongue
i
guess
this
would
be
smooth
drinking
but
the
taste
is
pretty
confusing
and
unattractive
for
me
this
flavor
is
bigger
than
the
smell
but
very
restrained
which
works
for
the
style
the
watermelon
aspect
is
better
than
i
would
have
thought
if
anything
it
tastes
a
bit
fake
somehow
like
how
a
lollipop
approximates
flavor
this
being
said
it
isnt
bad
but
it
feels
unnatural
the
more
traditional
aspects
are
good
and
the
drinkability
is
high
this
would
likely
be
better
if
it
were
fresher
also
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
the
watermelon
flavor
becomes
watery
rather
the
sweetness
from
the
impact
isnt
strong
enough
to
last
d
im
wondering
if
this
was
on
the
shelf
too
long
or
something
because
i
had
abad
experience
with
this
brew
i
would
have
assumed
this
to
be
a
lot
lower
rated
on
here
than
it
is
i
would
not
find
this
drinkable
in
a
beer
situation
at
all
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
with
ha
hint
of
green
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
vanishes
within
seconds
the
aroma
is
of
watermelon
there
is
also
a
tart
aspect
to
the
aroma
that
isnt
pleasing
to
me
i
am
sure
this
beer
smells
how
it
is
intended
to
but
it
simply
smells
bad
the
taste
is
of
very
mild
watermelon
and
not
much
else
really
this
taste
is
of
virtually
nothing
it
isnt
bad
it
just
isnt
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
low
carbonation
bad
for
a
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
a
fairly
bad
beer
i
will
not
drink
it
again
d
its
nice
and
drinkable
because
of
how
mild
it
is
ill
never
confuse
this
with
an
ipa
or
stout
but
its
good
easy
drinking
for
a
warm
day
d
i
have
picked
up
a
6pack
on
a
few
occasions
first
its
normally
cheap
yay
cans
and
second
i
love
watermelon
i
imagine
if
youre
not
a
fan
you
wont
dig
it
something
i
bring
to
a
party
if
i
have
a
few
extra
bucks
but
not
in
the
regular
rotation
md
unfortunatley
i
samples
this
beer
on
a
damp
autumn
night
and
it
was
just
okay
it
would
be
much
better
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
would
not
recommend
this
just
not
appealing
at
all
d
light
enough
to
consume
easily
but
the
flavor
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
glad
i
go
to
try
it
but
definitely
wouldnt
have
it
again
d
medium
the
taste
and
novelty
just
wear
out
after
a
while
had
this
been
colder
or
had
i
more
of
a
thirst
for
a
light
refreshing
beverage
it
might
work
on
a
hot
summer
day
maybe
on
this
cool
fall
day
not
so
much
would
be
highly
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
tasted
better
than
expected
to
me
its
a
good
novelty
summer
fruit
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
as
im
not
a
big
fan
of
watermelon
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
and
does
not
leave
much
lacing
behind
nose
is
pretty
one
dimensional
with
watermelon
dominaing
semisweet
but
not
overly
ripe
taste
is
similar
although
a
bit
of
the
wheat
characteristics
make
heir
way
through
feel
is
a
bit
light
but
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
and
this
is
better
than
many
other
fruit
forward
apwas
i
cant
believe
i
still
have
four
left
ugh
overall
definitely
worth
trying
there
are
far
worse
fruit
wheat
beers
out
there
i
dont
think
a
beer
gets
more
drinkable
than
this
a
smooth
refeshing
wheat
beer
with
a
nice
light
fruit
flavor
just
under
the
surface
d
this
beer
despite
the
seemingly
capricious
nature
of
its
featured
adjunct
demands
to
be
taken
seriously
unlike
so
many
americanstyle
fruit
beers
this
does
not
seem
as
if
it
was
engineered
to
please
nonbeer
drinkers
in
fact
this
does
not
come
across
as
an
effortless
lawnmower
beerwhile
it
is
refreshing
it
would
probably
be
much
too
beerlike
for
the
casual
drinker
of
alcopop
or
light
beer
interesting
stuff
here
the
watermelon
works
with
and
contrasts
itself
at
the
same
time
perhaps
a
bit
to
intricate
though
still
somewhat
drinkable
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
into
different
kinds
of
fruit
beers
lightbodied
with
slightly
above
average
carbonation
and
pretty
boring
overall
on
the
mouthfeel
side
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
order
a
second
glass
unless
you
hate
watermelon
or
wheat
i
would
strongly
suggest
giving
this
one
a
shot
even
though
it
didnt
meet
all
of
my
expectations
d
not
impress
with
this
at
all
it
need
to
be
sweeter
and
maybe
add
some
other
flavors
to
enhance
the
watermelon
more
im
probably
going
to
have
to
drain
pour
the
rest
of
this
kudos
to
these
guys
for
trying
something
unique
but
it
just
simply
doesnt
come
out
very
well
its
worth
trying
to
see
what
its
like
but
do
what
i
did
only
buy
a
single
this
is
an
awesomely
unique
beer
with
a
strong
watermelon
smell
and
taste
im
not
sure
the
beer
under
it
is
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
hada
bit
grainy
lacking
some
of
the
complexity
of
a
good
wheat
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
not
rich
enoughbut
the
idea
of
mixing
watermelon
juice
and
a
decent
wheat
beer
is
just
a
really
good
one
and
this
is
a
great
very
drinkable
summer
beer
pretty
hazy
lighter
gold
colored
brew
small
white
head
but
it
lasts
a
while
wheat
malt
scent
with
a
nice
dose
of
watermelon
nice
light
wheat
taste
nice
infusion
of
the
watermelon
kind
of
sharp
on
the
tongue
but
a
lighter
to
medium
bodied
brew
thats
fairly
wet
nice
light
brew
for
the
summertime
12
ounce
can
not
decanted
aroma
very
hard
to
describe
i
suppose
the
smell
is
like
sugarry
watermelon
juice
kinda
unpleasant
taste
is
actually
nice
and
interesting
and
not
what
i
expected
after
struggling
with
the
aroma
sort
of
a
nice
flavor
to
add
into
a
wheat
beer
not
sure
why
im
almost
embarrassed
to
admit
that
i
like
this
beer
but
i
do
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
faint
wheat
note
and
a
small
fruitiness
in
the
taste
well
it
tastes
like
a
watermelon
jolly
rancher
a
small
dry
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
watermelon
jolly
rancher
aftertaste
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
average
wheat
beer
and
dropping
a
couple
watermelon
jolly
ranchers
in
there
and
then
drinking
it
a
very
popular
beer
this
summer
its
easy
to
see
why
this
little
man
in
a
can
is
so
appealing
to
so
many
but
the
purist
in
me
hates
gimmicks
yes
it
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
and
at
parties
beaches
etc
hell
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ever
a
quality
owing
more
to
lacking
flaws
than
having
virtues
that
extend
beyond
a
squirt
of
fruit
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
soda
fizz
head
that
dies
almost
immediately
aromas
are
very
simple
and
straightforward
a
bit
of
wheatiness
and
a
lot
of
watermelon
not
bad
by
any
means
but
neither
is
it
ponderous
in
the
least
same
for
the
taste
and
feel
it
takes
its
name
literally
and
is
not
nasty
in
the
least
but
neither
is
it
interesting
enough
for
me
to
ever
buy
again
unless
its
for
a
beach
party
of
the
uninitiated
taste
is
also
pretty
straightforward
its
clean
finishes
nicely
its
medium
body
is
a
bit
much
for
the
style
wish
it
was
a
little
lighter
grainy
in
the
back
some
sweetness
with
the
watermelon
flavor
overpowering
the
other
malts
and
any
hops
its
about
what
youd
expect
a
watermelon
wheat
to
taste
like
the
drinkability
will
vary
by
how
much
you
like
watermelonfruit
beers
for
me
i
could
do
3
max
and
then
be
burnt
out
but
as
i
said
some
could
do
many
many
more
some
1
and
done
this
beer
would
have
to
be
paired
very
carefully
as
the
watermelon
flavor
would
not
play
off
of
strong
savory
or
sweet
flavors
well
drinkability
i
bought
a
sixpack
for
my
wife
whos
a
watermelon
fiend
and
even
though
she
told
me
i
couldnt
have
one
im
having
one
now
i
dont
think
ill
have
another
one
i
imagine
however
that
some
folks
would
dig
it
under
the
right
circumstances
appearance
is
a
light
golden
straw
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
of
light
fruit
perhaps
watermelon
light
honey
taste
is
very
light
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
watermelon
than
wheat
but
there
is
still
a
faint
note
having
a
light
graininess
to
it
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
its
not
a
bad
wheat
nice
and
light
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
light
and
well
carbonated
i
could
see
where
this
could
be
quite
sessionable
for
some
and
where
i
did
enjoy
trying
this
i
feel
i
would
tire
of
the
watermelon
flavour
after
a
pint
or
two
its
not
bad
its
just
not
a
flavour
i
associate
with
beer
peculiar
for
sure
drinkability
interesting
brew
but
one
was
enough
for
me
as
the
watermelon
became
a
little
irritating
about
34
the
way
through
d
i
could
pound
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
not
too
high
in
abv
so
i
could
handle
this
this
is
strictly
a
summer
beer
though
tastes
like
bread
grain
watermelon
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
not
overly
sweet
and
the
watermelon
flavor
is
light
but
it
is
present
decent
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
not
much
aftertaste
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
not
sure
i
will
pick
this
one
up
again
bought
this
on
a
whim
while
grabbing
a
few
other
items
at
the
lolcal
bottle
shop
dark
orangish
in
color
with
a
fizzy
sodalike
had
that
disappeared
quickly
wheat
and
yeast
aromas
with
a
definite
sweet
watermelon
aroma
as
well
syrupy
feel
with
a
burst
of
carbonation
in
the
beginning
wheat
and
yeast
flavors
in
the
front
that
taper
to
sweet
watermleon
and
orange
flavors
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
mouthfeel
was
zesty
with
a
medium
to
light
body
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
couple
fingers
of
head
the
smell
is
funky
but
not
in
a
good
belgian
sort
of
way
instead
its
a
strange
unpleasant
smell
somewhat
wheat
like
but
not
entirely
the
first
taste
is
bitter
although
not
strongly
so
after
another
sip
or
two
i
start
to
notice
the
watermelon
flavor
but
im
not
enjoying
it
i
tried
to
finish
this
but
it
became
a
drain
pour
instead
perhaps
its
just
the
watermelon
but
this
beer
simply
does
not
work
for
me
even
though
i
love
wheat
beers
and
fruit
beers
drikability
is
amazing
i
could
sit
there
and
drink
this
all
day
absolutely
fantastic
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
very
filling
it
is
slightly
more
alcoholic
than
your
run
of
the
mill
macrobrews
making
it
possible
to
drink
a
great
many
of
these
at
any
given
time
its
a
good
beer
to
give
to
new
beer
drinkers
its
an
excellent
example
of
how
diverse
craft
beers
can
be
at
the
cloverleaf
tavern
in
caldwell
nj
it
poured
a
cloudy
yellowgold
with
one
finger
of
white
average
retention
and
average
lacing
the
nose
was
surprisingly
grassy
herbal
and
modestly
bitter
with
very
little
hint
of
the
watermelon
therein
the
taste
revealed
the
watermelon
blended
nicely
with
herbal
hop
and
malt
midpalate
and
not
overpoweringly
sweet
as
in
some
fruit
beers
also
it
didnt
fall
flat
at
the
finish
as
in
other
fruit
beers
the
balance
was
apparent
in
a
crisp
somewhat
minty
finish
i
must
admit
this
was
a
huge
surprise
of
a
beer
after
having
two
other
watermelon
beers
in
recent
memory
which
were
godawful
this
was
a
nice
thin
lawnmower
alternative
for
the
summer
months
not
bad
but
not
a
seek
it
out
must
have
d
i
dont
know
how
much
of
this
id
actually
be
interested
in
drinking
at
a
time
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
quite
refreshing
and
better
than
some
of
the
other
beers
that
were
on
tap
d
goes
down
alright
still
not
that
great
overall
notes
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this
beer
since
it
just
arrived
into
my
area
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
is
not
memorable
either
i
think
it
needs
a
little
more
kick
in
the
flavor
department
t
the
taste
is
reversed
from
the
smell
the
watermelon
is
bold
and
the
wheat
is
mild
its
like
a
jolly
rancher
was
put
into
a
wheat
beer
refreshing
but
this
taste
is
too
candyish
i
was
only
good
with
having
two
then
had
to
move
on
notes
this
is
a
very
average
wheat
beer
with
some
flavor
thrown
in
to
make
it
more
interesting
than
just
a
bland
beer
i
dont
think
the
watermelon
flavor
affects
the
score
really
at
all
with
it
the
beer
is
average
and
i
wouldnt
have
missed
it
if
it
wasnt
there
at
all
after
drinking
it
i
feel
that
despite
it
being
hailed
as
a
watermelon
wheat
beer
the
traces
of
watermelon
are
all
but
forgotten
the
beer
is
light
and
makes
for
a
good
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
other
than
that
not
impressed
light
body
but
not
overly
fizzy
watermelon
comes
across
very
subtle
without
an
artificial
feel
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
not
bad
this
beer
was
gross
overall
wont
ever
drink
this
again
i
only
finished
it
since
i
paid
2
for
it
after
seeing
this
beer
on
a
website
showing
cool
beers
i
should
try
name
seemed
interesting
and
inviting
and
after
looking
at
the
ba
overall
reviews
for
this
beer
i
decided
to
try
it
and
man
was
it
a
complete
disappointment
drinkability
sorry
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
its
difficult
for
me
to
be
particularly
interested
in
a
bland
wheat
ale
with
a
boring
watermelon
character
bummer
drinkability
this
is
the
cud
of
the
beer
world
never
again
we
just
had
21st
amendment
brewery
become
available
here
in
georgia
i
really
liked
their
ipa
and
figured
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
it
being
summer
pours
a
watery
yellow
with
very
little
yeast
though
the
can
was
agitated
per
instructions
white
head
disappears
almost
immediately
smell
is
rather
sour
and
has
hints
of
not
so
fresh
vegetable
matter
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
i
hope
this
is
a
bad
batch
because
this
to
me
is
undrinkable
d
a
good
summer
beer
one
is
plenty
for
me
as
i
would
grow
tired
of
any
watermelon
beer
fairly
quickly
give
it
a
try
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
lower
abv
makes
this
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
sixer
of
no
problem
the
fruit
flavor
is
very
pronounced
and
would
make
it
a
good
for
lack
of
better
terms
a
girlie
beer
a
good
beer
that
hits
the
style
of
what
it
says
it
is
going
to
be
not
getting
watermelon
in
the
smell
maybe
a
wheat
cereal
type
smell
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
not
much
else
tastes
akin
to
a
watery
wheat
beer
with
the
tasteless
white
part
of
the
watermelon
mixed
in
there
is
a
slight
bit
of
acidity
to
be
found
but
not
enough
to
make
things
interesting
fairly
light
bodied
for
a
wheat
beer
not
my
favorite
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
can
drinkability
the
watermelon
flavor
was
there
the
whole
time
and
was
very
intriguing
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
though
good
for
a
novelty
but
average
drinkability
my
can
says
its
made
in
mn
so
im
not
sure
where
its
made
anyway
the
appearance
was
alright
had
a
nice
little
head
to
it
but
died
out
quickly
to
a
thin
lacing
then
to
nothing
color
was
a
hazy
faint
straw
my
nose
was
a
little
stuffy
but
from
what
i
could
tell
it
was
mostly
a
wheaty
smell
with
background
smells
of
watermelon
malts
and
very
little
hops
taste
was
more
wheat
in
the
beginning
but
as
it
went
down
your
throat
the
watermelon
really
showed
itself
it
was
almost
as
if
someone
dropped
a
jolly
rancher
in
my
wheat
beer
but
not
as
sweet
and
fake
tasting
great
beer
for
the
summer
overall
a
decent
beer
glad
i
finally
tried
it
taste
overall
lots
a
caramel
and
not
your
typical
wheat
flavors
intense
caramel
just
as
it
touches
the
tongue
which
them
moves
to
straw
and
bread
malts
up
front
with
a
thin
slightly
bitter
edge
hints
at
grape
tons
of
caramel
in
the
middle
smooth
but
not
too
sweet
though
tropical
fruits
in
the
background
finish
is
quite
thick
with
light
caramel
bread
and
long
lingering
yeast
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
crisp
feel
to
it
like
a
larger
goes
down
easy
and
is
pretty
drinkable
d
easy
drinker
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
if
i
couldnt
find
any
water
nothing
special
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
one
finger
of
head
that
was
gone
before
i
could
discern
what
color
it
was
white
if
i
recall
correctly
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
in
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
watermelon
the
taste
is
your
basic
wheat
beer
with
some
watermelon
flavor
the
flavor
reminds
me
mostly
of
watermelon
rind
it
is
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
it
was
worth
a
try
and
is
quite
refreshing
after
working
outside
10
hours
in
the
mid
90s
delicious
to
say
the
least
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
put
away
i
am
glad
this
made
its
way
over
to
ohio
pouring
out
a
light
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
vanishes
suddenly
the
smell
is
what
youd
expect
rather
sugary
with
heavy
watermelon
and
wheat
the
wheat
is
light
with
a
small
watermelon
back
its
subtle
but
very
much
there
nothing
very
complex
but
really
i
dont
want
too
much
in
this
guy
at
4
9
its
perfect
for
spending
the
day
hanging
out
with
friends
or
family
without
having
something
thats
going
to
knock
you
on
your
ass
i
imagine
that
if
the
flavor
was
good
the
feel
would
be
ok
but
the
fact
that
this
beer
made
my
mind
go
down
the
i
never
want
to
drink
again
path
but
i
dont
know
that
i
will
be
getting
it
again
at
the
current
price
tag
near
me
good
for
the
novelty
of
the
beer
but
not
my
style
for
those
fruitwheat
people
you
may
enjoy
not
heavy
on
the
way
down
and
easy
to
drink
although
does
not
scream
back

its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
id
drink
it
again
i
really
enjoy
the
clean
pumpkin
flavor
on
this
easy
drinking
lager
a
little
lighter
in
flavor
than
most
but
i
like
that
its
different
ill
be
buying
it
again
next
year
a
pleasant
spiced
seasonal
pumpkin
brew
you
pretty
much
wouldnt
know
this
was
a
lager
unless
the
label
said
so
ive
had
plenty
of
lighterseeming
pumpkin
ales
perhaps
a
bit
drier
than
the
impression
i
have
thus
far
given
which
makes
this
something
that
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
come
time
to
dole
out
the
goods
to
the
trolling
neighborhood
kiddies
edit
im
eating
a
tuna
sandwich
now
finishing
up
this
beer
it
actually
pairs
well
with
that
so
its
not
a
totally
by
itself
beer
this
one
was
easy
to
finish
bottoms
up
overall
too
light
too
sweet
and
too
much
spice
relative
to
the
underlying
flavors
but
i
guess
thats
what
happens
with
a
pumpkin
lager
not
a
fan
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
nice
ring
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
pretty
much
for
the
taste
as
well
with
lots
of
good
flavor
medium
bodied
and
perfect
carbonation
goes
down
easy
and
really
tasty
a
easy
9
if
not
higher
for
this
one
you
can
actually
count
the
number
of
rings
from
each
sip
which
turned
out
to
be
11
love
it
if
a
truly
good
pumpkin
beer
does
exist
this
is
it
o
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
watered
down
though
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
like
the
crispness
of
it
and
the
well
balanced
spices
nothing
special
here
its
not
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
but
ts
also
far
from
the
best
the
spice
overload
is
a
bit
too
much
to
enjoy
i
like
beer
so
this
should
be
right
up
my
alley
i
gave
it
a
good
heavy
handed
pour
resulting
in
two
fingers
of
creamy
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
pumpkinlike
orangishamber
srm
7
9
with
nequality
clarity
i
know
that
8
is
between
7
and
9
but
my
card
does
not
have
that
shade
nose
was
very
spicy
cinnamon
clove
and
ginger
being
prevalent
mouthfeel
was
much
fuller
than
the
stoudts
pumkin
lager
giving
this
one
a
creamy
aspect
the
spices
were
just
right
not
overwhelming
and
by
closing
my
eyes
i
could
imagine
drinking
a
cool
pumpkin
latte
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
lager
but
dont
tell
linus
or
he
might
be
panicked
get
it
a
great
pumpkin
lager
finish
was
semidry
but
because
they
showed
some
restraint
at
the
spice
shelf
it
was
not
as
dry
as
it
might
have
been
id
rate
a
cider
with
these
properties
higher
but
i
expected
more
from
a
beer
o
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
flavor
to
it
and
is
quite
enjoyable
nice
combination
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
pumpkin
and
cardamon
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
definitely
recommend
this
one
for
a
quite
enjoyable
brew
for
a
fall
evening
great
with
ginger
snaps
after
dinner
i
believe
that
ales
are
always
more
flavorful
than
lagers
and
the
only
mistake
that
lakefront
made
here
was
to
introduce
this
as
a
lager
i
find
real
flavor
and
appeal
its
just
too
weak
overall
i
think
this
is
just
mediocre
in
all
aspects
not
above
and
beyond
in
any
particular
way
but
more
a
bunch
of
okay
aspects
that
make
for
an
okay
beer
pours
a
hazy
peachy
copper
with
a
white
fizzy
foam
that
retains
well
light
aroma
of
pumpkin
spices
and
bready
lager
yeast
in
the
taste
crispness
of
lager
yeast
upfont
spices
mid
palate
and
finishes
with
pumpkin
flavor
light
cinnamon
and
allspice
crisp
solid
pumpkin
lager
so
many
better
fallpumpkin
themed
brews
out
there
this
is
a
much
better
pumpkin
beer
than
i
was
expecting
it
is
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
small
but
respectable
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweetish
with
a
grainy
lager
background
ans
a
sweep
pumpkin
pie
forenose
spice
honey
pie
reminiscent
cream
and
crust
interesting
and
enjoyable
the
sweetness
could
get
a
little
overwhelming
but
in
small
volumes
this
is
great
smooth
and
flavorful
i
would
easily
have
another
o
this
is
actually
much
better
than
i
thought
i
had
a
beer
tasting
the
other
night
where
eight
of
us
sampled
21
pumpkin
beers
this
was
the
only
lager
and
i
was
very
surprised
i
am
drinking
a
full
serving
tonight
and
enjoying
i
expected
a
molsen
canadien
that
tasted
like
it
had
allspice
and
nutmeg
mixed
in
i
was
very
wrong
this
can
stand
up
to
the
ales
and
in
some
cases
beat
them
any
day
try
this
it
is
a
different
approach
but
a
good
one
average
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
this
again
this
is
a
fairly
decent
pumpkin
beer
no
more
no
less
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
o
3
25
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
lager
very
crisp
and
refreshing
o
i
found
this
to
be
an
easydrinking
pumpkin
beer
that
has
a
good
balance
between
the
pumpkin
flavors
and
spices
it
would
make
for
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
an
autumnthemed
dinner
i
absolutely
love
this
one
one
of
two
southern
tier
pumpking
pumpkin
biers
i
will
drink
the
addition
of
pumpkin
to
the
mash
allows
this
lager
to
showcase
the
pumpkin
with
a
clarity
that
is
unparalleled
this
bier
made
me
like
pumpkin
pie
when
i
drink
this
i
know
its
autumn
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
for
someone
looking
for
the
ultimate
pumpkin
beer
but
if
you
wanted
a
taste
of
the
season
without
getting
full
then
this
would
be
your
beer
oone
of
the
lower
rated
pumpkins
i
tried
in
2013
overall
not
a
bad
fall
pumpkin
beer
but
perhaps
if
it
wasnt
a
lager
some
of
the
spice
smell
and
flavor
would
be
stronger
overally
a
nicely
balanced
pumpkin
beer
not
much
going
on
other
than
some
malt
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
spices
but
thats
what
i
like
from
a
pumpkin
ale
id
buy
this
again
taste
spices
up
front
light
cinnamon
and
cloves
stand
above
the
rest
a
bit
of
grassy
or
hay
like
flavor
with
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
character
of
bread
and
caramel
this
is
a
lager
so
finishes
pretty
clean
o
lakefront
pumpkin
lager
is
a
exceptionally
crafted
pumpkin
beer
that
takes
the
richness
of
pumpkin
ale
and
drops
it
back
a
few
notches
creating
a
great
startoffall
beverage
thats
still
drinkable
and
refreshing
in
warm
weather
but
with
the
pumpkin
and
spice
remains
great
when
it
cools
down
also
a
good
beginner
pumpkin
beer
for
those
who
want
to
get
their
feet
wet
and
one
of
my
personal
favorites
of
the
season
a
excellent
beer
pours
an
orangered
totally
clarified
with
a
waifish
head
that
fizzles
away
quickly
on
the
nose
youve
got
cinnamon
first
and
foremost
if
you
really
get
in
there
its
like
a
stick
of
big
red
underneath
that
is
that
is
an
earthy
leafy
aroma
smells
sweet
and
spicy
man
you
can
really
taste
the
pumpkin
in
this
and
the
spice
and
i
think
im
getting
the
alcohol
coming
through
pretty
prominently
for
what
is
this
a
six
sweet
and
a
little
malty
otherwise
nice
mouthfeel
good
flavor
but
light
and
refreshing
i
think
you
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
getting
burnt
out
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
really
goes
down
easy
not
like
an
amazing
pumpkin
beer
but
worth
picking
up
for
the
season
ill
probably
buy
some
more
while
its
out
i
have
tried
other
beers
pumpkin
ales
not
lagers
that
seem
to
fall
short
in
pumpkin
flavor
that
im
looking
for
it
seems
it
only
add
a
tiny
dash
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
nothing
more
however
this
may
be
what
its
supposed
to
be
and
maybe
my
preferences
are
different
than
others
who
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
this
beer
never
fails
to
please
me
o
yet
another
overspiced
pumpkin
beer
and
this
one
is
of
the
more
subtle
lager
variety
making
the
imbalance
more
of
an
issue
nonetheless
the
wellchosen
mix
of
spices
will
appeal
to
those
who
like
spicy
pumpkin
beers
this
pumpkin
ale
is
pretty
average
a
little
heavy
on
certain
spices
but
a
decent
beer
overall
o
this
is
an
ok
beer
nothing
bad
and
its
different
but
doesnt
push
any
boundaries
lakefront
is
better
than
some
pumpkin
beers
ive
encountered
it
has
an
easy
drinkability
and
smooth
mouthfeel
but
is
lacking
some
of
the
depth
that
these
beers
deserve
basically
just
another
pumpkin
beer
nothing
special
though
refreshing
overall
a
simple
tasting
pumpkin
beer
with
a
good
taste
and
even
better
palate
check
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
o
not
going
to
bowl
you
over
in
the
end
drinkable
spiced
enough
to
give
you
some
appreciation
of
that
pumpkin
feel
and
easy
enough
balanced
for
multiples
worthy
a
single
try
poured
into
nb
globe
appearance
is
a
clear
orange
with
a
layer
of
white
head
some
lacing
present
nose
pairs
familiar
pumpkin
spices
along
with
a
grainy
lager
base
cinnamon
and
all
spice
come
through
the
most
one
significant
difference
between
this
and
other
pumpkin
brews
is
having
a
lager
as
a
base
this
provides
a
grainy
and
bready
profile
instead
of
a
sweet
base
the
taste
features
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
along
with
cinnamon
the
spice
is
present
but
not
in
your
face
the
flavor
tapers
off
and
has
a
dry
bready
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
prefer
my
pumpkin
brews
in
the
form
of
ale
but
this
isnt
a
bad
by
any
measure
overall
a
unique
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
but
the
spices
are
a
bit
too
much
i
think
if
the
spice
was
toned
down
it
would
allow
more
subtle
characters
to
come
through
really
nice
job
by
lakefront
the
weakness
here
is
we
got
a
lager
this
is
better
than
the
average
lager
but
the
lager
has
weaker
flavor
compared
to
the
good
ale
pumpkin
beers
however
this
would
do
in
a
pinch
i
would
like
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
very
refreshing
goes
down
well
with
summer
jazz
fest
music
like
joe
zawinul
music
the
spices
outshine
in
this
one
and
the
ginger
really
in
my
opinion
shines
the
most
its
good
but
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
less
tart
it
was
an
interesting
beer
thatd
id
have
again
next
year
at
halloween
time
no
problem
its
like
a
pumpkin
pie
baked
by
a
middle
school
home
ec
class
its
edible
since
its
pumpkin
pie
and
honestly
id
eat
pumpkin
pie
that
had
been
dropped
on
the
floor
but
the
seasoning
hints
towards
a
complete
lack
of
experience
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
baked
it
like
they
just
raided
the
spice
cabinet
and
started
pouring
things
in
all
willy
nilly
o
this
isnt
amazing
but
it
was
better
than
the
couple
of
pumpkin
ales
i
had
the
other
night
the
pumpkin
and
spice
aroma
is
great
overall
an
average
pumpkin
beer
that
smells
really
good
but
the
taste
does
not
follow
up
at
the
same
level
not
bad
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
i
will
pass
in
the
future
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
an
average
head
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
spices
thats
hard
to
pin
down
maybe
nutmeg
maybe
some
cinnamon
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
not
overly
so
cinnamon
seems
to
come
through
the
strongest
with
slight
grass
and
bread
flavors
typical
of
a
lager
not
very
complex
but
nothing
offensive
either
thin
mouthfeel
not
too
bad
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
memorable
going
on
here
overall
im
not
blown
away
by
this
but
nor
am
i
offended
its
actually
a
pretty
sessionable
affair
and
the
mouthfeel
really
is
nice
i
get
cinnamon
the
most
here
and
its
got
a
nice
spicy
kick
to
it
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
smells
slightly
of
stewed
veggies
with
some
pie
spice
taste
is
an
initial
candy
sweetness
followed
by
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
vanilla
there
is
a
bit
of
grain
after
that
and
some
nutmeg
in
a
semisweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
nicely
rich
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
most
pumpkin
beers
are
ales
but
this
lager
offering
is
a
nice
spicy
treat
that
is
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
at
a
halloween
party
pours
transparent
amber
in
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
soon
disappears
completely
the
bouquet
is
actually
quite
nice
with
healthy
doses
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
some
nutmeg
there
is
also
a
tartness
to
the
aroma
the
origin
of
which
i
am
curious
to
discern
in
the
palate
the
flavor
largely
matches
the
aroma
but
is
more
subdued
the
pumpkin
takes
a
bit
of
a
back
seat
to
the
spices
but
the
blend
works
well
nonetheless
i
think
the
tartness
detected
in
the
nose
may
actually
be
afforded
by
the
cinnamon
which
is
not
a
spice
i
have
much
familiarity
with
when
it
comes
to
beers
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
more
substantive
but
on
the
whole
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
brew
and
one
of
the
more
palatable
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
overall
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
not
great
in
the
same
light
of
a
lot
of
imperial
pumpkin
ales
but
pretty
damn
good
as
far
as
a
lighter
pumpkin
brew
goes
o
a
middleoftheroad
attempt
at
a
seasonal
style
it
doesnt
really
make
me
want
another
and
to
be
honest
its
not
making
me
crazy
about
seeking
out
other
lakefront
beers
ill
probably
keep
my
eyes
open
for
some
though
especially
their
ipa
i
heard
its
worth
a
look
this
beer
is
exactly
what
a
lager
is
in
respect
to
smell
and
taste
the
appearance
was
close
to
a
light
orangedark
gold
consistency
the
beer
had
little
aromaticity
in
regard
to
the
being
a
pumpkin
beer
i
caught
a
hint
of
some
spices
i
honestly
would
expect
to
be
able
to
smell
the
pumpkin
or
some
floralnutty
undertones
this
beer
did
not
have
that
aspect
the
taste
was
like
a
smooth
a
normal
lager
style
beer
it
didnt
have
much
bite
back
and
was
very
smooth
overall
i
just
wasnt
impressed
with
the
beer
itself
i
think
pumpkin
beer
should
at
least
have
scent
and
taste
of
pumpkin
nice
to
see
lakefront
beer
in
my
area
now
poured
one
and
a
half
bottles
into
a
12
liter
steindeep
burnt
orange
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
ofjust
a
thin
off
white
sheet
alot
of
spice
in
the
nosemainly
cinnamon
and
cardamom
i
pick
upnot
much
different
than
many
pumpkin
beer
out
there
spiced
with
a
dryer
than
expected
malt
base
wich
kept
the
sweetness
in
check
but
the
finish
lacks
any
real
depth
alot
of
cinnamon
flavors
but
the
thinner
feel
to
the
beer
actualy
keeps
it
from
being
overbearingin
saying
that
its
pretty
average
and
light
overall
really
like
this
one
it
delivers
what
i
want
in
a
pumpkin
lager
the
pumpkin
and
spices
are
there
but
they
arent
overpowering
it
all
sits
very
well
this
is
clean
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
id
certainly
pick
this
up
again
overall
drinkability
pretty
good
started
out
better
than
hornycopia
which
i
was
sampling
along
with
this
lacked
a
good
finish
overall
i
tried
about
5
or
6
of
these
over
the
last
few
days
and
they
all
run
together
and
seem
to
taste
the
same
with
subtle
differences
this
is
on
of
the
more
bland
ones
but
still
just
another
pumpkin
beer
o
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
probably
overlooked
due
to
the
lack
of
art
work
and
familiarity
with
the
brewer
but
this
beer
is
spot
on
for
the
season
purpose
not
the
best
pumpkin
but
far
from
the
worst
i
poured
thsi
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
deep
rich
coper
color
body
with
a
small
tannish
head
that
hanged
around
for
a
little
while
the
aroma
is
mainly
pumpkin
pie
spices
with
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
flavor
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
pumpkin
pie
but
has
a
little
more
malt
flavor
towards
the
bakc
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
overall
lakefront
does
another
quality
job
with
a
spiced
beer
a
pumpkin
lager
that
gives
a
spot
on
representation
of
a
warm
pumpkin
pie
the
slight
warming
is
a
magnificent
touch
overall
i
feel
this
beers
best
quality
is
it
is
visual
very
attractive
great
color
clarity
and
good
head
for
the
style
next
is
mouth
feel
smooth
with
a
spicy
bite
at
the
end
not
surprised
of
the
lack
of
pumpkin
in
this
beer
the
rest
is
solid
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
average
not
my
favorite
as
far
as
the
pumpkin
category
but
ranks
high
in
my
lager
category
im
just
not
a
lager
guy
there
are
better
pumpkin
brews
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
amber
color
the
head
was
a
little
on
the
soapy
looking
side
the
lacing
was
minimal
and
the
retention
wasnt
overly
impressive
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
lager
yeast
aromas
as
well
as
the
traditional
pumpkin
spice
notes
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
an
earthy
spiced
flavor
through
that
mixed
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
with
i
feel
it
should
be
heavier
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
m
lighter
side
of
medium
body
heavier
side
of
medium
carbonation
crisp
feel
overall
a
very
wellspiced
pumpkin
lager
oh
yeah
its
a
lager
easy
to
drink
for
what
it
is
when
it
comes
to
spiced
beer
its
pretty
subjective
on
whether
you
want
more
than
onebut
we
could
see
having
more
than
one
there
is
depth
but
lightness
as
well
two
worlds
that
should
have
met
a
long
time
ago
perhaps
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
slightly
orange
dark
yellow
straw
colored
very
slight
haze
as
well
started
with
a
2
finger
off
white
head
that
faded
to
none
after
a
few
minutes
aroma
was
a
sweet
pumpkin
with
small
hints
of
spice
mostly
like
a
pie
puree
taste
was
slightly
sweet
but
fairly
bland
akin
to
a
bland
bread
felt
a
bit
over
tingly
in
the
mouth
but
coated
well
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
pumpkin
beer
nothing
outstanding
in
any
direction
this
beer
is
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
savory
this
beer
can
go
well
with
savory
foods
such
as
turkey
and
be
a
great
dessert
beer
or
just
to
drink
around
overall
this
beer
is
very
wellblended
and
mellow
nothing
is
overpowering
or
out
of
balanceproportion
a
rarity
among
pumpkin
beers
overall
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
it
starts
out
really
promising
it
smells
good
but
it
doesnt
translate
on
the
palate
there
is
an
adjunct
wheat
quality
in
the
finish
that
throws
this
thing
off
kilter
and
the
spices
are
not
nearly
noticeable
enough
o
this
is
one
of
those
inoffensive
mostly
forgettable
beers
notes
its
spiced
so
well
all
the
way
around
what
a
tasty
beer
cheers
bummer
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
was
brewed
in
wisconsin
purchased
in
golden
colorado
the
flavor
was
entirely
too
spiced
like
pumpkin
in
a
can
and
the
beer
had
a
filling
malty
element
to
it
i
cant
say
i
hate
it
because
i
dont
at
all
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
the
inaugural
brew
of
the
season
dont
think
i
could
do
a
6pack
of
this
the
drinkability
wasnt
there
at
least
my
palate
is
ready
to
go
now
o
not
a
very
good
beer
it
isnt
offensive
but
its
bland
and
lacking
any
depth
o
like
others
have
said
far
from
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
but
also
far
from
the
worst
overall
i
enjoyed
it
o
not
terrible
but
it
didnt
really
taste
like
a
pumpkin
ale
this
isnt
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
but
its
far
from
the
worst
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
go
and
see
for
yourself
honestly
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
a
pumpkin
lager
before
regardless
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
bright
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
pale
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
nutmeg
brown
sugar
light
white
bread
light
caramel
sweet
flowers
clove
and
a
touch
of
mildly
tart
orange
flesh
nice
and
spicy
baby
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
bread
coming
in
lightly
toasted
the
orange
toning
down
the
tartness
and
the
caramel
coming
in
a
bit
stronger
theres
not
much
actual
pumpkin
in
here
if
at
all
but
the
spices
are
definitely
present
in
spades
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
surprisingly
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
one
that
really
embraces
the
spicy
side
of
pumpkin
beers
without
going
too
far
with
it
well
done
sweet
but
not
cloying
definite
holiday
spices
some
heavier
malts
which
is
good
less
pumpkin
than
other
beers
yet
more
flavor
overall
than
most
medium
body
tingly
carbonation
and
some
stickiness
is
delovely
yup
delovely
like
it
a
bit
recommend
it
o
seems
like
a
routine
fruit
beer
nothing
made
me
think
of
pumpkin
really
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
objectionable
about
it
m
sweetens
with
time
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
and
scent
are
difficult
to
pinpoint
very
floral
but
not
pumpkin
drinkability
not
enough
body
for
me
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
lager
takes
away
some
of
the
balance
that
i
want
out
of
a
pumpkin
the
flavors
are
a
tad
too
flat
for
my
liking
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
number
of
years
and
my
remembrance
of
the
taste
has
not
changed
o
overall
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
2011
and
it
was
a
nice
one
to
start
the
season
out
with
o
this
is
what
pumpkin
beer
should
taste
like
one
of
my
favorites
just
like
pumpkin
pie
its
right
up
there
with
pumking
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
top
pumpkin
beers
on
my
list
pours
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aromas
of
baking
spice
a
little
bready
and
finally
some
vegetalpumpkin
on
the
tail
end
spices
dominate
this
beer
especially
the
cinnamon
i
still
am
able
to
detect
some
pumpkin
on
the
palate
and
as
this
is
a
pumpkin
lager
as
opposed
to
the
more
popular
ale
it
finishes
pretty
clean
overall
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
and
the
first
one
i
have
had
in
a
couple
seasons
overall
i
did
read
from
some
of
the
other
reviews
on
here
that
some
people
did
pick
up
on
almost
a
crustlike
flavor
in
the
background
i
do
get
that
impression
from
this
one
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
seasonal
selection
personally
i
would
like
it
if
this
was
an
all
year
beer
instead
of
a
seasonal
serviceable
pumpkin
beer
served
labour
day
weekend
t
the
brewery
light
colourlacey
with
almost
no
head
spicy
pumpkin
and
cloves
in
the
style
and
better
than
some
pumpkin
beers
though
not
the
best
representative
ok
drinkability
must
be
in
the
mood
to
finish
a
half
pint
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
style
it
seems
like
it
is
just
some
novelty
that
grew
out
of
proportion
but
this
isnt
bad
o
ok
not
bad
but
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
for
a
nice
fall
beer
overall
lager
pumpkin
interesting
combination
the
crisp
nature
coupled
with
the
fall
spices
plays
out
like
an
homage
to
summer
gone
and
fall
coming
its
stuck
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
good
and
meh
o
too
much
of
the
lager
comes
through
without
enough
of
the
pumpkin
the
spices
are
there
but
its
not
the
greatest
balance
or
combination
o
i
have
found
most
of
the
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
to
be
a
little
to
spiced
for
my
liking
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
it
pains
me
to
say
this
but
paul
you
were
right
this
one
pours
a
very
light
bodied
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
aromas
are
very
sweet
and
full
of
spice
it
has
the
generic
pumpkin
vibe
and
is
kind
of
syrupy
sweet
the
flavors
again
are
all
spice
a
lot
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
moderate
amount
of
sweetness
and
a
somewhat
artificial
pumpkin
flavor
its
ok
but
doesnt
really
resemble
pumpkin
pie
or
anything
like
some
other
pumpkin
beers
do
it
drinks
very
light
and
smooth
for
being
a
lager
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
more
crisp
the
flavor
is
decent
but
overall
this
one
doesnt
compare
to
other
pumpkins
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
small
areas
of
lace
slide
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
spice
heavy
with
cinnamon
and
cloves
being
most
prominent
and
some
light
pumpkin
pie
aromas
taste
is
cinnamon
forward
with
some
light
malt
and
somewhat
artificial
pumpkin
flavors
on
the
finish
aftertaste
is
pretty
much
like
you
get
after
chewing
cinnamon
gum
and
then
spit
it
out
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
interesting
to
see
this
is
a
lager
and
therefore
doesnt
quality
under
the
pumpkin
ale
category
overall
not
too
bad
for
this
style
of
beer
but
not
that
great
either
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
the
big
flavors
that
other
pumpkin
ales
have
as
of
late
it
seems
they
divide
these
pumpkin
beers
into
standard
ones
like
this
ale
and
the
imperial
pumpkins
which
are
bigger
and
more
complex
cheers
overall
not
bad
for
a
1
49
however
it
does
lack
flavor
for
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
its
a
little
disappointing
tastes
more
like
a
lager
with
a
bit
of
pumpkin
versus
a
fullblown
pumpkin
ale
nevertheless
not
bad
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
that
is
enjoyable
but
nothing
amazing
do
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
complaint
this
isnt
a
bad
little
pumpkin
beer
especially
for
a
lager
quite
refreshing
would
have
been
better
to
have
this
one
and
a
couple
more
perhaps
in
the
fall
drinkability
decent
brew
for
a
relatively
standard
fruitveggie
beer
i
would
rank
this
one
and
wassatchs
punkin
ale
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
tried
the
taste
has
some
slight
pumpkin
character
in
the
background
though
its
not
all
that
sweet
like
many
pumpkin
beers
the
taste
is
light
ginger
plus
some
caramel
nutmeg
allspice
and
clove
mildly
bready
as
well
fairlylight
body
with
a
carbonation
level
toward
the
low
end
light
and
not
terribly
drinkable
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
alright
if
average
brew
to
fill
your
spiced
autumn
brew
needs
ddont
ever
need
to
try
this
again
drinkability
actually
not
as
bad
as
the
other
features
but
to
be
quite
honest
and
not
to
bash
the
beer
completely
im
not
exactly
the
biggest
fan
of
fruity
toned
beers
but
other
pumpkin
style
beers
i
had
encountered
so
far
since
fall
began
has
been
nothing
but
good
maybe
next
time
but
i
must
say
this
brew
is
not
for
me
for
the
time
being
cheers
dm
nice
crisp
carbonation
but
the
head
really
doesnt
stick
very
well
overall
a
pretty
tasty
enjoyable
brew
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
lagers
ive
had
yet
they
did
a
nice
job
on
this
beer
and
the
abv
is
perfect
the
finish
is
quite
sweet
malty
with
a
hint
of
creamy
pumpkin
all
in
all
id
put
this
lager
up
there
with
the
more
wellbalanced
highly
drinkable
spiced
beers
d
while
you
dont
really
get
much
pumpkin
out
of
the
beer
the
spices
are
enough
to
make
you
think
of
fall
all
in
all
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
more
solid
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
this
year
which
is
saying
something
considering
this
is
my
8th
or
9th
pumpkin
beer
d
while
this
one
doesnt
stand
out
in
the
vast
sea
of
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
the
lakefront
pumpkin
is
underappreciated
compared
to
the
previous
reviews
on
ba
imo
lakefront
pumpkin
lager
beer
awful
name
btw
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
for
people
who
love
pumpkin
spices
it
is
not
very
balanced
and
it
has
virtually
no
actual
beer
flavor
i
will
never
understand
why
this
is
so
popular
but
who
am
i
to
judge
its
not
for
me
and
thats
why
i
offer
so
many
alternatives
at
the
shop
drink
this
isnt
much
of
a
drinker
1
at
a
time
is
really
enough
for
me
even
though
i
did
have
3
in
a
sitting
last
night
kind
of
became
too
much
the
spices
really
take
over
after
the
first
one
d
this
beer
works
for
me
its
a
well
made
lager
as
lakefront
is
known
to
do
manages
to
avoid
being
flabby
like
most
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
while
still
having
the
spice
to
make
me
think
fall
the
only
complaint
would
be
the
apparent
lack
of
actual
pumpkin
flavor
although
im
not
sure
if
its
possible
to
naturally
add
that
without
taking
away
that
characteristics
that
i
love
about
this
beer
anways
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
in
a
sixer
so
far
although
still
not
quite
as
good
as
st
ambroise
the
great
pumpkin
ale
and
that
nice
light
one
what
was
it
oh
yeah
pumking
d
this
is
an
ok
pumpkin
beer
a
good
autumn
offering
from
lakefront
drinkability
overall
this
beer
has
improved
with
aging
in
that
the
spices
and
the
malt
have
softened
and
blended
together
well
it
doesnt
surprise
me
very
much
because
lakefronts
holiday
spice
is
also
much
better
with
a
few
years
of
aging
than
it
is
fresh
from
the
brewery
this
beer
was
just
a
big
wow
when
i
opened
it
earlier
today
drinkability
is
not
good
since
there
are
plenty
of
other
goodgreat
pumpkin
beers
d
easily
drinkable
just
not
very
special
would
benefit
from
a
little
better
balance
generally
with
pumpkin
aleslagers
the
spice
is
done
improperly
and
leaves
me
with
a
distaste
this
is
one
of
the
few
exceptions
not
something
id
seek
out
but
i
drank
the
whole
thing
drinkable
no
more
than
12
kind
of
disappointed
pumpkin
and
beer
are
2
of
my
favorite
things
this
beer
was
ordinary
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
just
because
while
the
spices
run
the
show
they
arent
overwhelming
the
sourness
in
the
finish
also
helps
to
keep
things
moving
too
having
a
bottle
thats
a
couple
years
old
so
im
giving
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
very
slight
pop
when
opened
and
small
tan
head
that
quickly
disappeared
and
no
lace
color
is
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
little
sediment
aroma
is
pumpkin
pie
spice
with
some
natural
pumpkin
and
malt
flavor
is
like
aroma
but
with
some
sour
beer
is
turningturned
body
is
ok
but
carbonation
is
going
flat
finish
is
like
flavor
ive
had
these
fresh
many
times
before
and
theyre
much
better
the
problem
with
the
beer
is
the
consistency
between
bottles
i
have
some
that
were
awesome
and
some
that
were
meh
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
traces
of
lace
almost
clear
amber

for
a
12oz

from

me
that
levity
brings
a
great
finishaftertaste
to
the
beer
pumpkin
spice
maintains
you
may
even
detect
a
sprinkling
of
vanilla
i
dunno
but
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
remains
drinkable
but
i
cant
see
having
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
sweetness
drinkability
is
good
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
just
beery
enough
and
spicing
is
controlled
clean
and
drinkable
for
a
spiced
beer
overall
a
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
granted
its
the
only
pumpkin
lager
on
the
market
so
its
hard
to
compare
this
is
one
of
the
least
offensive
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
overall
a
nice
offering
at
a
pumpkin
a
good
job
by
lakefront
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
id
suggest
this
one
from
lakefront
the
body
on
this
one
is
a
little
thin
but
this
aids
in
drinkability
as
this
is
quite
refreshing
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
the
pumpkin
is
there
but
not
overpowering
in
any
way
the
spices
are
muted
as
well
theres
a
very
pleasant
honeykissed
bready
aftertaste
that
i
really
dig
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkinflavored
beer
to
date
thanks
again
andy
picked
up
a
single
bottle
for
a
couple
bucks
at
princeton
liquors
the
beer
looked
great
after
pouring
clear
pumpkin
orange
with
a
tall
white
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
heavily
spice
like
most
beers
in
the
style
but
not
over
the
top
it
can
be
a
bit
hard
to
pick
out
the
pumpkin
in
between
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
but
its
here
with
a
creamy
candy
pie
taste
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
better
jacks
pumpkin
spice
from
ab
all
in
all
a
respectable
pumpkin
ale
but
it
could
use
more
actual
pumpkin
flavor
d
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
not
bad
either
id
try
it
again
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
the
biggest
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
as
drinkable
as
any
other
ive
had
final
thoughts
pretty
boring
pumpkin
beer
with
light
tastes
lots
of
syrup
like
tastes
and
flavorings
semi
sweet
low
carbonation
low
spices
at
least
and
its
so
called
lager
but
i
really
dont
get
much
for
lager
tastes
or
crisp
refreshingness
drinkability
while
this
is
imo
a
very
balanced
pumpkin
brew
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
a
sweet
pumpkin
taste
as
that
is
my
preference
that
being
said
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
however
not
my
number
one
choice
when
reaching
for
pumpkin
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
perfect
for
a
crisp
fall
afternoon
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
very
fast
leaving
nothing
behind
no
blanket
and
no
lacing
at
all
looks
like
a
glass
of
juice
after
a
few
minutes
smells
of
pumpkins
fruits
and
malts
maybe
some
nutmeg
too
i
get
a
hint
of
funkkriek
for
some
reason
too
tastes
of
pumpkin
malts
nutmeg
some
strange
citrusfruit
taste
that
makes
the
beer
taste
more
artificial
some
sweetness
too
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
with
a
pretty
large
carbonation
bite
and
no
alcohol
warming
drinkability
is
alright
not
the
best
taste
not
a
bad
price
the
taste
seems
to
die
down
after
a
bit
and
go
to
very
sweet
pumpkin
taste
probably
wont
get
this
one
again
i
had
this
beer
at
the
institute
in
philadelphia
on
draft
i
have
to
say
this
was
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
this
year
which
includes
southern
tiers
pumking
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
and
a
couple
others
that
escape
my
memory
lakefronts
pumpkin
beer
is
smooth
with
a
real
pumpkin
flavor
without
being
too
sweet
most
of
the
others
were
only
vaguely
pumpkiny
with
the
alcohol
and
spices
drowning
out
the
pumpkin
flavor
this
one
highlights
the
pumpkin
flavor
without
overburdening
it
with
high
alcohol
or
choking
the
flavor
with
spices
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
an
clear
orangeamber
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
cap
aroma
is
spicy
with
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
ginger
the
most
discerable
scents
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
beer
is
sweet
and
malty
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
coming
through
in
the
finish
good
drinkability
on
this
one
coppery
orange
in
color
minimal
head
and
lacing
smell
is
dominant
of
malts
and
grain
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
sugary
fruit
the
taste
is
lead
by
bready
malts
pumpkin
pie
spices
add
a
nice
touch
but
there
is
too
much
of
a
candied
sugar
taste
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
interesting
but
the
candied
sugar
taste
distracts
from
the
balance
taste
is
dough
pumpkin
pie
grainbiscuit
finish
pumpkin
pie
element
is
light
but
firm
and
wellintegrated
into
the
overall
doughybready
beer
character
it
has
hints
of
both
fresh
pumpkin
and
pumpkinpie
spices
its
very
good
lighter
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
smooth
with
a
few
highlights
not
bad
drinkability
its
definitely
refreshing
and
a
nice
beer
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
beer
it
is
way
to
light
on
the
spices
and
pumpkin
instead
offering
a
really
tangy
and
strong
taste
of
fruit
i
still
think
its
a
good
beer
just
not
what
i
would
go
for
as
my
first
choice
in
pumpkin
beers
would
not
drink
again
a
taste
two
years
later
is
compleely
different
over
spiced
and
under
pumpkined
whats
up
with
that
not
recommended
for
a
retaste
except
maybe
on
my
swing
through
the
region
next
month
if
it
can
be
found
on
tap
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
some
creaminess
to
it
this
isnt
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
anyone
who
cant
detect
pumpkin
in
this
one
should
get
over
their
cold
put
less
stock
in
their
palate
or
get
a
fresh
bottle
just
saying
fizzy
copper
orange
hue
this
beer
had
a
raucous
amount
of
carbonation
it
sounded
like
rice
crispies
as
the
head
was
dwindling
no
lacing
left
behind
the
head
was
an
off
white
fizzy
spectacle
aroma
is
hitting
hard
with
the
pumpkin
spices
with
nut
meg
allspice
and
cinnamon
not
much
gourd
going
down
in
my
glass
as
far
as
the
smell
of
it
flavor
tart
tongue
raping
experience
rotten
pumpkin
sourness
with
the
flavor
that
you
get
before
you
want
to
vomit
this
is
an
utterly
disgusting
brew
that
is
the
first
drain
pour
ive
gone
threw
in
quite
some
time
again
no
pumpkin
tones
just
heavy
acidic
spicing
levels
kills
the
palate
and
numbs
your
cheeks
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
carbonated
water
with
a
cloying
level
of
acidity
drinkability
like
a
said
previously
this
ones
going
down
the
drain
i
like
most
of
the
lakefront
offerings
however
this
sucks
ass
drinkability
is
decent
any
ba
who
loves
pumpkin
pie
spices
will
like
this
brew
but
for
those
looking
for
a
balanced
pumpkin
beer
this
is
not
good
pumpkin
beers
should
be
treated
like
esbs
where
it
is
all
about
balance
too
many
end
up
as
overspiced
fall
beers
that
are
not
very
drinkable
and
this
is
no
exception
d
refreshing
and
different
but
not
really
tasty
this
is
your
bud
light
of
pumpkin
beers
too
bad
d
if
you
really
like
the
flavor
its
good
if
not
not
so
much
a
beer
that
could
go
either
way
not
a
good
pumpkin
ale
at
all
as
it
warms
up
it
smells
good
at
start
and
deceives
the
drinker
that
a
good
ale
will
follow
but
the
finish
is
absolutely
downright
awful
and
the
flavors
of
citrus
negate
any
of
the
good
spices
and
pumpkin
flavor
a
good
ale
of
this
style
should
have
avoid
this
beer
33
5
overall
probably
not
worth
having
around
when
there
are
such
good
pumpkin
beers
available
i
do
think
id
rather
drink
this
than
post
road
brooklyn
though
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
good
overtone
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
rather
appetizing
it
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
with
not
much
of
a
head
pumpkin
flavor
is
strong
but
does
not
overpower
the
malt
there
are
hints
of
cinnamon
and
hops
texture
is
glasssmooth
and
just
a
little
tingly
a
good
fall
beer
but
enjoyable
any
time
of
year
d
a
bit
different
then
other
pumpkin
lagers
in
taste
but
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
unfortunately
kind
of
ruins
the
positives
of
the
taste
and
smell
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
soapy
off
white
head
no
real
lace
present
smells
savorylike
pumpkin
pie
spice
honey
and
buttery
grain
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
but
still
retains
enough
real
beer
flavor
to
be
palatable
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
dry
finish
one
of
the
better
beers
of
its
ilk
it
is
what
it
is
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
this
isnt
a
bad
one
not
bad
drinkable
and
all
but
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spice
theres
a
light
cream
head
stitting
on
an
amber
body
strong
sent
of
spices
theres
a
light
to
medium
body
with
some
strong
maltyness
the
spices
are
not
a
strong
as
the
inital
aroma
suggests
the
all
spice
cinnimon
and
ginger
contribute
to
the
toasty
munich
malt
and
meaty
pumpkin
flavors
every
flavor
has
its
moment
on
your
pallette
over
all
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
enjoy
try
with
a
baked
squash
or
corn
sufflet
well
as
you
can
see
this
didnt
work
for
me
at
all
way
too
overspiced
and
cloying
at
times
maybe
if
there
had
bit
a
bit
of
lager
like
crispness
this
would
have
gone
down
easier
but
nope
i
wont
be
visiting
this
again
bottle
from
paulys
orange
in
color
with
a
minimal
white
foam
head
gingercinnamonand
nutmeg
spice
aromas
tastes
like
grandma
made
pumpkin
pie
with
some
lager
in
the
mix
very
nice
very
subtle
nice
mouthfeel
some
lacing
solid
offering
drinkability
worth
a
bottle
or
pint
a
solid
easily
drinkable
pumpkin
brew
though
liking
pumpkin
beers
may
be
a
prerequisite
d
pretty
high
but
i
think
the
ketchup
smell
would
turn
me
away
before
i
had
to
many
but
the
taste
is
right
on
overall
impression
this
was
my
first
pumpkin
beer
and
my
first
attempt
at
drinking
a
beer
for
a
review
i
joined
a
review
group
and
pumpkin
beer
was
first
on
the
agenda
and
i
will
say
it
was
interesting
the
initial
aroma
was
far
and
away
the
highlight
for
me
and
i
found
it
less
enjoyable
as
i
went
along
it
is
definitely
more
pumpkin
pie
than
straight
pumpkin
but
that
may
be
standard
for
this
type
of
brew
i
am
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
pie
but
had
never
had
the
desire
to
try
a
pumpkin
beer
while
i
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
it
was
enough
to
get
me
interested
in
trying
other
pumpkin
beers
d
very
sessionable
its
subdued
spiced
nature
and
crisp
refreshing
character
make
lakefront
pumpkin
lager
a
worthy
harvest
beer
drinkability
this
one
is
not
fake
in
flavor
like
some
other
pumpkin
beers
and
with
this
being
a
lager
is
a
lighter
and
somewhat
refreshing
worth
trying
this
one
overall
light
easy
drinking
sessionable
and
modest
notes
the
malts
were
too
mildbut
it
was
a
fine
beer
and
worth
it
i
suppose
that
while
this
beer
lacked
in
spicesmalts
it
made
up
for
in
balance
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
2
fingers
of
foamy
white
head
ok
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
bread
and
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
tastes
of
light
citrus
up
front
then
bread
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
medium
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
good
pumpkin
and
spices
malty
yet
balanced
not
too
intense
on
any
of
the
flavors
but
nicely
paired
pleasant
easy
to
drink
and
not
tasting
too
high
in
alcohol
making
for
a
very
nice
sessionable
pumpkin
ale
for
the
fall
season
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
brew
ive
tried
and
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
its
a
lager
that
explains
the
rich
smooth
quality
very
different
from
a
pumpkin
ale
doesnt
have
all
the
complexity
that
you
can
get
with
an
ale
instead
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
and
the
simple
character
really
shines
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
very
intense
pumpkin
scent
along
with
an
equally
intense
cinnamon
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
and
light
crystal
malt
taste
with
a
huge
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
flavor
its
nothing
great
for
sure
its
just
lots
of
fruit
and
a
very
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
although
they
should
back
down
the
fruit
flavor
and
add
some
nutmeg
pours
a
pale
copper
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
pie
not
strong
but
noticable
nutmeg
allspice
and
cinnamon
are
predominate
some
buttery
malt
and
pumpkin
the
taste
has
a
strong
grain
quality
with
weak
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavor
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
plenty
of
carbonation
finishes
slightly
sweet
and
spicy
an
ok
pumpkin
bre
at
best
some
pumpkin
flavors
there
but
they
are
overpowered
by
the
grain
and
carbontion
easy
drinking
though
d
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
of
this
much
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
not
terrible
just
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
i
really
liked
the
smell
of
the
beer
the
flavor
not
so
much
here
is
a
time
that
a
beer
started
off
very
promising
and
couldnt
quite
pull
it
off
in
the
end
i
wanted
this
to
be
so
much
more
im
not
in
a
hurry
to
have
another
one
in
the
taste
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
very
high
level
of
carbonationthink
pumpkin
soda
im
almost
tempted
to
throw
in
some
ice
cubes
except
that
it
isnt
very
sweet
more
sour
than
pumpkiny
this
one
is
difficult
for
me
to
drink
sorry
a
clear
miss
it
is
very
drinkable
the
smell
may
seem
more
powerful
than
the
taste
at
first
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
a
great
seasonal
beer
clear
orange
to
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
creamcolored
head
that
dropped
quickly
but
left
a
subtle
lacing
on
the
glass
malty
spice
cinnamonnutmeg
in
the
nose
flavor
was
malty
with
the
fruit
and
spice
youd
expect
but
this
was
unique
because
it
offered
the
smoothness
of
a
lager
rather
than
the
ales
typically
pumpkined
at
this
time
of
year
as
the
glass
warmed
the
alcohol
came
out
a
bit
in
the
flavor
but
the
spice
kept
it
in
check
not
bad
enjoyable
light
amber
to
red
in
color
with
barely
noticeable
prickle
and
a
faint
wispy
head
very
mild
nose
of
pumpkin
spice
and
chalk
water
by
chalk
water
i
mean
it
smells
similar
to
the
water
in
a
bucket
after
washing
the
blackboard
in
grade
school
mild
attack
flavor
of
pumpkin
and
malty
grains
clean
finish
but
mildly
sweet
grain
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
compared
to
many
pumpkin
ales
and
lagers
i
would
say
pretty
good
and
call
it
a
b
ive
had
two
pumpkin
flavored
beers
blue
moons
harvest
moon
the
other
and
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
of
the
two
an
avergae
pumpkin
flavored
beer
nothing
bad
nothing
great
drinkability
is
good
this
will
not
be
my
go
to
beer
but
ill
grab
some
next
fall
when
foods
accented
by
these
flavors
will
be
featured
at
thanksgiving
and
the
like
worth
a
try
dvery
good
seasonal
beer
but
its
not
something
that
i
will
look
forward
to
next
year
if
you
are
ever
in
milwaukee
you
need
to
tour
poured
a
cloudy
goldenorange

pretty

i
had
a
tough
time
finishing
the

dry
finish
is
memorable
the
nutmeg
and
spices
takes
centerstage
but
is
balanced
by
light
caramel
in
the
taste
pumpkin
is
there
not
only
alluded
to
with
spices
but
in
natural
pumpkin
squashy
flavor
as
well
better
than
many
in
terms
of
authenticity
certainly
more
balanced
than
dfh
punkin
if
this
wasnt
my
4th
beer
i
would
have
drank
the
hell
out
of
it
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
but
it
has
nothing
on
dfh
so
hard
to
find
here
d
not
impressed
at
all
ive
been
spoiled
in
that
i
used
to
live
closer
to
deleware
and
had
dogfishhead
pumpkin
all
the
time
this
is
not
even
close
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
edit

had
this
one
much
fresher
some
im
upping
some
scores
still
i
enjoyed
this
one
recommended
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
only
a
thin
lace
of
head
around
the
edge
of
the
clear
a
lot
of
floaties
in
this
one
aroma
is
pleasant
with
hints
of
nutmeg
the
taste
is
full
of
spices
especially
nutmeg
and
ginger
but
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
seems
quite
carbonated
and
doesnt
go
down
all
the
smooth
but
not
much
bitterness
here
either
although
the
appearance
is
lackluster
and
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
to
brag
about
the
aroma
and
taste
are
what
make
this
beer
stand
out
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
another
interesting
take
on
the
pumpkin
thing
and
it
works
well
the
mild
spicing
is
enjoyable
and
works
well
with
the
clean
and
dry
lager
base
especially
good
on
these
80
degree
october
days
throughout
the
experience
this
beer
was
very
uncharacteristic
for
a
lager
almost
no
carbonation
and
an
odd
grainy
texture
the
starchy
malt
lingers
on
the
palate
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
dozen
or
so
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
this
fall
i
will
however
try
it
again
next
year
and
reevaluate
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
good
patchy
lacing
standard
pumpkin
beer
aroma
of
pie
spices
cinnamon
ginger
and
clove
mostly
medium
carbonation
and
a
light
medium
body
taste
is
nicely
balanced
some
genuine
pumpkin
flavors
mingle
with
the
dominant
spicing
and
some
spicy
hops
to
create
a
pleasantly
drinkable
lager
i
prefer
this
one
to
most
of
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
not
bad
overall
a
decent
spiced
pumpkin
lager
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fuller
body
of
an
ale
is
better
suited
for
the
style
d
nice
and
easy
sipper
lighter
in
color
than
i
expected
an
almost
golden
amber
the
aroma
is
very
strong
and
suggests
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
before
trying
this
beer
i
was
never
quite
sure
what
mouthfeel
actually
meant
but
this
beer
has
a
definite
mouthfeel
that
to
me
is
dry
and
almost
powdery
almost
as
if
the
spices
are
floating
right
on
top
the
taste
is
okay
and
definitely
pumpkin
but
the
dry
feeling
is
tough
for
me
to
get
past
why
why
why
why
do
they
keep
making
beers
like
this
i
know
there
is
a
market
for
this
but
there
just
so
damn
bad
there
is
really
only
2
pumpkin
beers
that
i
think
are
even
decent
and
this
is
not
one
out
them
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
i
would
probably
drink
it
off
of
looks
the
smell
has
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
to
it
the
taste
is
kind
of
like
a
red
beer
that
they
drug
through
a
wheat
field
there
are
nutmeg
and
odd
spices
that
dont
really
sit
well
with
me
tastes
very
simple
dry
and
spice
pumpkin
rind
orange
flavor
late
and
dries
with
a
carbonaton
that
acridly
clears
the
palette
peppery
zing
md
mouthfeel
and
stingy
carbonation
that
i
found
distracting
drinkability
didnt
do
anything
for
me
it
went
down
easy
but
i
did
not
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
glad
i
tried
it
and
im
glad
it
was
part
of
a
gift
pack
apparently
this
one
varies
wildly
from
batch
to
batch
and
this
particular
batch
bottled
second
week
of
oct
06
seems
a
solid
version
of
the
style
but
still
would
like
to
feel
like
i
licked
the
inside
of
a
pumpkin
gutsandall
real
good
but
still
searching
for
that
perfect
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
starts
with
a
mediumstrong
spice
aroma
of
cloves
and
nutmeg
deep
copperorange
color
is
great
for
this
style
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
big
pumpkin
taste
and
medlow
spices
to
balance
again
diacetyl
detracts
from
this
beer
mostly
in
the
finish
drinks
okay
basically
one
or
2
thats
it
were
having
a
halloween
paty
im
sure
i
can
foist
these
on
some
unsuspecting
guests
i
messed
up
again
a
bit
different
because
it
you
drink
this
too
cold
its
worthless
but
its
a
lager
and
you
dont
really
want
it
to
warm
up
too
much
semi
hazy
amber
bronze
color
smallish
white
head
atop
dwindles
instantly
not
much
of
a
sign
of
carbonation
after
the
initial
pour
once
warmed
a
touch
theres
a
solid
pumpkin
precense
lots
of
spice
in
the
aroma
but
the
spice
array
is
a
bit
more
indescript
than
other
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
decent
pumpkin
beer
all
around
smoother
than
most
yet
with
a
nice
array
of
flavors
finish
is
a
tad
too
spiced
solid
for
one
i
dont
think
id
really
care
for
another
overall
impression
meh
this
beer
is
not
quite
right
i
wont
be
looking
again
eric
slainte
love
the
round
mouth
easily
drinkable
also
to
note
i
agree
with
the
person
who
mentioned
that
some
batches
are
different
than
others
i
was
elated
with
this
last
beer
i
poured
out
but
would
not
give
as
high
a
score
to
other
batches
ive
tried
still
lakefronts
pumpkin
lager
won
me
over
the
first
time
i
tried
it
and
its
something
i
look
forward
to
every
season
drinkability
decent
purchased
bottle
in
menomonee
falls
wi
this
was
a
decent
fruitvegetable
beer
except
for
the
overpowering
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
spices
added
to
pumpkin
pie
this
is
much
like
leinies
apple
spice
in
that
the
motto
seems
to
be
the
more
spices
the
more
flavor
well
more
isnt
always
better
as
opposed
to
blue
moons
far
superior
pumpkin
beer
lakefronts
lager
is
too
overspiced
the
beer
looks
good
a
cloudy
orangish
color
it
smells
like
thanksgiving
at
grandmas
the
flavor
was
overpowering
as
previously
stated
too
much
perfumesweetness
in
what
could
have
been
a
nice
autumn
brew
definitely
not
up
to
lakefronts
quality
standards
d
average
to
slightly
below
average
pumpkin
beer
this
is
a
lager
and
not
an
ale
so
the
brewery
is
trying
something
different
here
its
too
bad
the
results
arent
that
spectacular
first
of
all
i
have
to
say
i
love
fruitspiced
beers
and
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
it
does
vary
a
little
bit
between
batches
some
being
better
than
others
but
usually
it
is
very
good
the
aroma
is
nice
with
the
spice
coming
through
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
nice
and
balances
well
with
the
spices
used
kind
of
like
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
pours
with
a
good
head
a
hazy
cloudy
orangish
amber
with
no
lacing
that
pumpkin
beer
smell
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
for
the
smell
not
bad
not
great
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
with
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
ginger
really
isnt
that
extraordinary
a
beer
just
doesnt
really
work
out
that
well
good
attempt
poor
execution
id
say
my
advice
go
to
the
brewery
for
a
truly
exceptional
oneofakind
brew
but
treat
it
just
as
thatoneofakind
and
not
to
be
found
anywhere
off
the
premises
this
sample
is
all
cloves
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
its
delicious
but
still
not
for
me
pours
an
uninspiring
orangeamber
with
a
bubbly
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
smell
is
heavy
on
the
allpurpose
pumpkin
pie
spice
assortment
mostly
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
some
sugrary
sweet
caramel
notes
taste
continues
with
the
canned
spice
extract
and
sweet
pumpkincaramel
malt
but
unfortunately
entertains
an
astringent
medicinal
bitterness
that
turns
it
all
foul
mouth
feel
is
thin
but
slick
theres
just
a
lot
going
on
here
that
doesnt
mesh
together
its
all
a
little
artificial
no
real
substance
dogfish
and
ofallon
are
oth
far
superior
to
this
timid
offering
hmm
a
pumpkin
ale
called
pumpkin
lager
thats
odd
hazy
copper
body
yellow
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
head
is
small
from
the
getgo
never
getting
more
than
a
small
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
sweet
and
spiced
with
your
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
thats
about
it
taste
is
terrible
nothing
like
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
sweet
and
funky
tastes
almost
infected
the
beer
was
bottled
the
4th
week
of
august
so
it
is
well
within
its
freshness
range
yuck
i
will
struggle
to
finish
this
one
i
thik
shipyard
has
the
ebst
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
so
far
i
have
tried
several
beers
from
this
brewery
and
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
any
of
them
until
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
one
i
really
like
pumpkin
beer
and
this
one
strikes
a
fine
balance
between
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
pumpkin
flavor
it
is
mediumbodied
and
sturdy
enough
to
support
the
spices
and
remain
smooth
and
drinkable
the
amber
color
reminds
one
of
an
oktoberfest
while
the
flavor
mixes
dried
fruit
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
perhaps
some
clove
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
tasty
brew
thats
perfect
for
the
harvest
season
id
buy
this
one
again
lakefronts
pumpkin
lager
looks
pretty
good
a
slightly
cloudy
suitably
orange
color
capped
by
a
fine
white
head
smells
yeasty
with
hints
of
the
promised
pumpkins
and
spices
but
not
much
the
taste
is
yeasty
as
well
kind
of
musty
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
in
the
finist
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
certainly
not
a
very
pumpkiny
pumpkin
beer
drinkability
i
can
only
drink
this
beer
once
in
a
sitting
this
will
most
likely
be
my
last
lakefront
pumpkin
for
the
year
although
a
buddy
of
mine
tried
it
on
tap
at
the
landmark
1850
and
he
said
it
was
awesome
he
had
three
in
one
sitting
drinkability
the
taste
and
medium
body
are
nice
but
the
lemon
wash
ultimately
has
me
seeking
something
else
tonight
pumpkin
lager
beer
is
as
twodimensional
as
they
come
and
is
quite
simply
abysmal
beer
i
have
never
homebrewed
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
could
do
better
than
this
on
my
first
attempt
i
will
now
have
serious
reservations
about
trying
any
more
beer
from
lakefront
you
however
at
least
with
regard
to
this
particular
beer
have
been
sufficiently
warned
cloudy
goldenorange
color
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
not
much
lacing
either
pumpkin
ginger
cinnamon
and
butter
bread
flavors
medium
body
body
with
a
buttery
mouthfeel
finishes
pretty
sweet
i
had
a
tough
time
finishing
the
bottle
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
i
like
some
aspects
of
it
and
will
enjoy
the
other
two
bottles
i
have
but
the
sourgreen
apple
notes
bring
this
score
downeven
though
they
are
not
as
strong
as
some
of
the
lakefront
litter
i
have
tried
hazed
dark
golden
tone
just
a
skimming
of
a
white
head
lacing
is
minimal
nose
is
all
about
the
spices
pumpkin
pie
spice
clove
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
a
little
sweet
malt
underlying
everything
this
beers
got
some
spice
on
the
buds
but
its
pretty
weak
in
the
malt
department
pumpkin
taste
is
lacking
its
a
little
phenolicmedicinal
as
well
not
really
that
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
was
like
most
standard
ales
sparkling
and
fullfilling
id
drink
again
during
the
season
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
though
theres
a
bit
too
much
cloves
for
my
particular
tastes
still
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
drinkability
and
overall
i
found
this
one
very
quaffable
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
works
well
for
me
a
nice
seasonal
offering
and
soup
made
a
fantastic
combination
that
would
have
warranted
a
4
04
5
rather
than
a
3
0
brewpubs
should
offer
this
mix
of
food
and
beer
as
a
special
for
the
month
of
october
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
style
there
is
a
great
deal
of
complexity
possible
in
this
style
and
i
believe
this
beer
does
a
nice
job
of
accomplishing
this
orange
in
color
with
a
brown
tinted
head
lightly
spiced
and
sweet
aroma
the
big
and
malty
flavor
holds
the
spices
in
check
and
the
body
makes
this
feel
like
a
meal
the
smoothness
makes
me
feel
like
im
drinking
a
regular
beer
this
is
very
well
balanced
one
of
my
two
favorites
in
the
pumpkin
beer
category
completely
clear
subamber
appearance
14
inch
head
diminishes
to
large
bubbles
on
the
surface
in
a
minute
laces
in
very
random
spots
not
much
other
than
pumpkin
pie
spice
to
the
aroma
slight
sense
of
white
pepper
maybe
low
carbonation
too
low
mouthfeel
is
feltlike
and
a
little
subpar
flavor
starts
predictably
vegetal
in
a
pronounced
cooked
celery
and
carrot
sense
with
cinnamon
sugariness
and
nutmeg
combining
in
an
early
statement
but
giving
up
to
a
watery
close
spice
attenuates
the
aftertaste
a
little
obvious
and
with
no
aspects
to
balance
it
out
as
a
pumpkin
beer
overall
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
less
than
average
for
me
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
clear
golden
with
an
orange
hue
head
is
small
and
reduces
to
just
a
thin
white
film
has
a
nice
spicy
aroma
of
cinnimaon
allspice
and
nutmeg
that
resembles
pumpkin
pie
well
as
others
mention
a
bit
over
carbonated
and
thin
flavor
isnt
all
that
bad
but
could
be
fuller
doesnt
match
the
aroma
at
all
a
little
bitter
i
havent
had
a
good
pumpkin
ale
in
years
and
the
last
good
one
i
had
was
bbs
several
years
ago
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
at
frog
bear
wild
boar
a
barclub
not
really
known
for
the
beer
selection
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
is
almost
spicy
enough
to
make
your
eyes
water
ginger
absolutely
dominates
with
a
little
pumpkin
and
malt
crying
for
attention
this
was
a
little
hard
to
drink
because
of
how
robust
the
spicy
flavor
was
i
would
have
welcomed
more
hops
or
malt
to
balance
out
the
spice
assault
dry
finish
an
interesting
attempt
but
not
something
i
am
going
to
search
out
again
a
good
autumn
brew
to
be
had
if
not
just
once
a
year
a
good
looking
appearance
with
its
hazy
orange
color
and
fluffy
white
head
the
twoinch
head
fades
quick
to
a
thin
film
with
little
lace
the
oder
was
its
down
side
for
me
the
taste
of
pumpkin
and
spice
mainly
nutmeg
cinnamon
was
good
mouthfeel
is
left
very
dry
at
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
seasonal
brew
pours
a
hazy
brownishorange
with
a
thin
head
that
disappeared
in
a
few
seconds
aroma
is
of
sweet
pumpkin
pie
and
nutmeg
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
of
the
taste
but
surprisingly
the
spice
pumpkin
flavor
and
mild
hop
taste
were
refreshing
pumpkin
lager
is
a
somewhat
gimmicky
beer
but
nonetheless
a
good
fall
and
thanksgiving
beer
to
try
a
refreshing
seasonal
lager
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
soft
white
head
with
heavy
carbonation
the
aroma
is
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
along
with
some
malty
notes
the
taste
is
the
aforementioned
spices
blended
with
a
faint
pumpkin
body
and
limited
hop
bite
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
this
is
a
very
good
specialty
lager
that
signals
the
beginning
of
fall
in
wisconsin
grab
a
cup
scoop
some
up
and
enjoy
i
like
fruit
beers
but
this
had
no
beer
taste
at
all
so
my
rating
of
this
is
based
on
what
it
is
not
what
other
beers
are
kinda
how
it
should
be
right
what
we
have
here
is
the
perfect
summer
day
beer
which
i
tried
in
the
winter
a
beer
that
shandys
likely
were
designed
to
emulate
my
rating
is
also
a
little
all
over
the
place
first
off
the
beer
looks
tragic
barely
fizzy
piss
perhaps
drinking
straight
from
the
can
is
a
good
route
to
take
get
past
the
look
and
take
a
whiff
to
find
a
pleasant
fruity
fragrance
that
seems
far
less
contrived
than
most
shandys
i
have
had
move
on
to
taste
and
it
is
light
fruity
refreshing
and
crisp
all
this
at
2
5
as
for
finish
heres
another
bonus
not
cloyingly
sweet
as
the
taste
may
suggest
look
this
isnt
something
you
will
crack
open
and
have
an
intellectual
moment
over
but
if
you
have
a
summer
drinking
marathon
in
your
future
you
have
got
to
get
a
few
of
these
especially
if
that
marathon
starts
before
noon
tastes
just
as
advertised
drank
from
a
can
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
idk
if
id
consider
this
a
beer
really
but
it
does
taste
great
and
it
def
has
beer
in
it
good
enough
for
me
in
a
can
5
0
great
on
warmhot
evenings
not
a
big
grapefruit
fan
but
this
is
nice
on
a
hot
day
overall
while
more
soda
like
then
beer
it
is
a
good
summer
beverage
that
would
be
fantastic
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
doing
yard
work
this
beverage
is
50
beer
and
50
grapefruit
juice
and
had
people
turning
their
nose
up
at
it
in
the
beginning
of
a
recent
tasting
i
held
but
this
tasty
treat
converted
a
lot
of
the
people
by
the
end
its
mild
beer
and
pink
grapefruit
taste
changed
a
few
minds
like
i
said
to
the
crowd
id
rather
drink
this
than
a
fake
fruit
cider
or
cooler
and
obviously
the
majority
agreed
very
refreshing
in
the
summer
nice
color
and
easy
pour
not
much
foam
o
not
bad
and
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
who
usually
hates
the
taste
of
grapefruit
ive
been
hearing
so
many
different
people
rave
about
this
stuff
i
had
to
give
in
and
buy
a
can
after
half
the
can
it
gets
to
be
too
grapefruity
but
they
certainly
accomplished
what
they
were
going
for
o
love
it
totally
different
take
on
a
fruit
beer
think
overly
sweetened
grapefruit
lemon
ade
its
quenching
but
not
very
beer
like
would
do
well
with
the
cider
crowd
i
think
please
seriously
consider
this
review
i
may
be
an
outlier
from
the
rest
but
i
sincerely
suggest
you
consider
an
alternative
to
this
particular
radler
if
you
want
something
that
tastes
even
remotely
like
a
beer
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
refreshing
beverage
its
not
very
beerlike
but
does
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
interesting
the
abv
is
very
low
and
it
is
hard
to
classify
this
as
a
beer
but
its
delicious
just
a
hint
of
beer
flavor
that
is
immediately
covered
up
by
a
wonderful
natural
grapefruit
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
drinks
i
have
had
in
awhile
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
beer
presence
but
for
what
it
is
excellent
will
drink
again
overall
a
delicious
and
thirst
quenching
radler
if
its
hot
as
hell
out
drink
this
at
the
beach
on
the
lawn
mower
or
just
sweating
your
ass
off
it
will
do
the
trick
2
75
more
soda
than
beer
there
will
definitely
be
fans
of
this
though
o
good
beer
o
surprised
with
the
crisp
refreshment
and
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
acidity
but
without
being
too
harsh
on
the
palate
one
cant
ask
for
a
whole
lot
more
than
the
light
but
not
shallow
body
zest
and
crispness
this
beer
brings
can
poured
a
light
yellow
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
aroma
of
fresh
grapefruit
juice
with
some
residual
sugar
is
as
far
remove
to
beer
as
possible
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
grapefruit
notes
with
some
residual
sugar
notes
and
some
light
wheat
malt
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
so
much
sugar
and
grapefruit
juice
that
it
does
not
resemble
beer
anymore
but
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
nonetheless
o
this
is
excellent
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
a
sixpack
of
this
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
but
even
more
so
after
having
sixpoints
rad
o
very
similar
to
a
grapefruit
soda
super
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
can
see
why
these
were
originally
for
cyclist
refreshment
it
is
great
on
a
very
hot
early
summer
day
here
in
nc
hottest
day
of
the
year
so
far
rjt
overall
tough
to
rate
as
a
beer
but
for
what
it
is
it
works
really
well
the
grapefruit
soda
plays
a
large
roll
in
the
overall
flavor
but
its
enjoyable
and
theres
enough
there
to
remind
you
that
you
are
actually
drinking
a
beer
some
moderate
effervescence
and
this
low
alcohol
brew
goes
down
easy
really
an
ideal
session
beer
during
summertime
afternoons
at
just
2
5
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
the
in
your
face
grapefruit
this
is
more
like
a
beer
cocktail
or
the
equivalent
to
a
wine
cooler
if
i
were
to
think
of
it
as
a
soda
it
is
better
than
fanta
or
fresca
as
far
as
beers
it
wasnt
really
present
in
the
taste
i
found
it
as
cloying
as
ciders
and
framboises
two
styles
im
not
too
fond
of
after
spending
countless
hours
in
bavarian
beer
gardens
in
the
summer
drinking
radlers
and
russns
this
brings
me
back
if
you
are
looking
for
a
real
beer
taste
then
this
is
now
what
you
want
if
you
want
a
summer
radler
then
this
is
a
fine
example
and
definitely
repeatable
for
the
style
very
referencing
and
low
alcohol
i
will
purchase
more
as
this
plus
schofferhofers
grapefruit
hefewiesse
and
sam
adams
porch
rocker
have
all
become
summer
staples
in
my
beer
fridge
cloudy
lemon
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
grapefruit
dominant
with
notes
of
floral
hops
and
crackery
malt
flavor
is
like
lemonade
but
with
grapefruit
tartness
slightly
sweet
s
touch
bready
and
somewhat
refreshing
not
your
typical
beer
per
se
but
it
has
its
place
ive
been
putting
down
a
lot
of
dipas
lately
and
needed
a
break
tonight
ive
always
seen
this
and
never
pulled
the
trigger
until
i
seen
it
at
a
bar
tonight
i
love
grapefruit
and
find
this
just
plain
delicious
not
something
i
could
session
though
but
a
nice
break
if
you
love
grapefruit
you
will
not
be
disappointed
a
very
flavorful
radler
incredibly
refreshing
makes
me
want
to
mow
the
yard
just
to
have
an
excuse
to
drink
a
couple
more
compared
to
some
other
radlers
and
shandies
ive
had
this
is
much
better
if
you
like
grapefruit
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
a
lowalcohol
thirstquencher
poured
a
cloudy
opaque
yellow
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
lacing
and
abundant
carbonation
bubbles
it
looks
like
fresh
squeezed
juice
or
a
headless
hefeweizen
scents
of
grapefruit
flesh
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
sweet
malt
not
much
to
the
aroma
but
it
isnt
bad
i
do
love
grapefruit
taste
begins
with
a
big
hit
of
sweet
grapefruit
soda
still
slightly
sour
as
one
would
expect
but
sweetness
balances
it
this
prevails
throughout
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
grapefruit
flavor
on
the
finish
though
extremely
faint
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
faintly
bitter
grapefruit
flesh
a
good
flavor
for
a
radler
very
fruity
full
of
grapefruit
flavor
and
refreshing
though
lacking
in
the
beer
flavors
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
slightly
tart
puckering
feel
the
after
swallow
feel
is
like
after
eating
grapefruit
flesh
quite
nice
and
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
a
radler
it
is
refreshing
fruity
and
crisp
and
does
its
job
well
not
bad
a
tangy
radler
with
a
lot
of
grapefruit
soda
sweetness
and
base
beer
wheatiness
earthy
weisse
yeast
has
a
touch
of
bubblegum
but
this
beer
is
grapefruitdominant
truly
what
its
intended
to
be
twofifths
beer
and
threefifths
summery
nonbeer
drinkers
delight
notes
of
lemon
flesh
and
green
apple
fight
to
be
tasted
very
refreshing
im
drinking
it
on
a
warm
muggy
evening
but
i
think
the
beer
would
look
and
taste
better
if
it
had
a
golden
stream
of
sunlight
shining
through
it
my
only
complaints
are
that
its
a
tad
too
carbonically
acidic
it
lacks
much
depth
of
flavor
and
its
a
bit
of
a
burpy
nightmare
for
a
radlershandy
were
hitting
the
nail
on
the
head
smells
strongly
of
grapefruit
and
the
taste
is
very
light
it
is
one
of
the
few
beers
my
girlfriend
would
drink
because
it
is
basically
like
drinking
juice
love
the
smell
and
love
the
taste
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
much
of
a
beer
at
a
low
2
5
abv
o
this
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
beer
but
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
for
a
refreshing
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
beer
would
probably
be
more
refreshing
in
the
summer
than
on
a
5
winter
day
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
o
i
remember
my
first
radler
in
germany
and
have
been
enjoying
them
since
typically
i
make
up
a
batch
of
my
own
to
enjoy
over
the
hot
summer
months
however
with
that
said
i
hesitate
to
call
this
a
beer
more
like
a
bottled
beer
cocktail
nevertheless
its
still
a
pleasant
drink
light
refreshing
and
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
literally
fresca
someone
put
fresca
in
a
bottle
and
told
me
its
beer
youre
saying
this
isnt
fresca
bullshit
its
fresca
thats
not
a
bad
thing
though
because
fresca
is
great
the
taste
has
a
sweet
citrus
flavor
which
is
tangy
but
not
bitter
with
some
light
wheat
flavor
adding
to
the
sweetness
of
the
grapefruit
and
presenting
some
malt
in
the
flavor
with
a
more
lemony
flavor
middle
to
finish
with
slight
efferscent
spice
in
the
background
overall
a
very
well
balanced
radler
nice
mix
of
wheat
with
citrus
fruit
not
going
overboard
it
starts
like
citrusgrapefruit
soda
and
finished
more
like
lemonwheat
enjoyable
a
wonderful
summer
brew
that
always
tastes
great
very
refreshing
enjoy
the
citrus
grapefruit
taste
it
blends
seamlessly
with
the
beer
enhancing
the
overall
taste
and
experience
very
crisp
also
enjoy
the
lemon
radler
from
stiegl
but
the
grapefruit
is
my
favorite
poured
from
a
500ml
can
pours
a
cloudy
and
fizzy
yellowish
color
with
no
head
nose
is
full
of
grapefruit
with
some
lemon
notes
of
sprite
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
even
brighter
with
nice
grapefruit
notes
the
grapefruit
has
a
bit
of
pucker
but
is
sweetened
up
by
the
soda
i
really
dont
detect
any
notes
of
the
beer
that
is
somewhere
hidden
in
here
but
i
guess
thats
okay
because
this
is
incredibly
tasty
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
light
overall
this
is
my
first
radler
and
it
is
quite
delicious
this
drinks
much
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
imagine
working
outside
on
a
blistering
hot
day
you
want
something
that
is
going
to
quench
your
thirst
but
also
something
sweet
not
so
alcoholic
and
still
beerish
its
as
simple
as
cutting
a
beer
with
soda
stiegl
opted
for
grapefruit
rather
than
the
traditional
lemon
here
surprised
this
style
has
not
caught
on
in
the
us
yetgood
drinking
for
what
it
is
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
a
radler
it
really
highlighted
those
fresh
grapefruit
flavors
and
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
a
nice
and
refreshing
after
doing
yard
work
in
the
summer
time
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
clean
refreshing
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
hopefully
it
doesnt
trigger
any
heartburn
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
fresh
grapefruit
flavor
and
the
true
to
style
mouthfeel
they
both
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
better
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
a
little
and
let
more
of
that
grapefruit
tartness
shine
through
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
think
i
would
mainly
get
it
in
the
summer
since
i
think
its
very
fitting
for
the
season
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
fruit
beers
shandys
or
grapefruits
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
had
all
the
makings
of
a
good
radler
and
besides
the
higher
sweetness
i
thought
it
was
pretty
sessionable
this
be
made
for
a
decent
first
impression
of
this
brewery
and
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
beers
from
them
nice
work
guys
in
the
end
i
had
hoped
for
a
bit
more
of
a
potent
grapefruit
and
not
this
sort
of
lemonade
sort
of
thing
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
too
punchy
as
well
the
balance
between
beer
and
fruit
juice
is
pretty
heavily
on
one
side
but
it
is
pretty
clean
and
drinkable
i
could
imagine
on
a
hot
day
next
to
a
lake
this
may
be
a
pretty
favorable
choice
and
a
good
crowd
pleaser
especially
when
there
are
people
who
may
not
drink
a
lot
of
beer
around
also
the
low
abv
is
nice
you
can
have
one
or
two
and
feel
good
continue
about
your
day
without
feeling
sluggish
i
wont
go
to
grab
more
i
was
satisfied
enough
to
try
it
though
not
bad
but
nothing
crazy
after
a
strenuous
bike
ride
with
20
lbs
on
my
back
this
was
the
perfect
thing
to
cool
down
with
which
is
its
precise
intended
purpose
its
not
an
ipa
not
beer
but
unless
its
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
not
a
repeat
purchase

and
if
you
handed
me
one
after

day

so
it
is

if
you
ask
me

i
keep
grabbing
a

this
is
a
whisper
of
a
beer
the
berries
are
hiding
behind
the
wheat
beer
character
that
is
disguised
as
an
alcoholic
beverage
as
an
adult
beverage
this
one
may
disappoint
but
as
a
refresher
hit
it
again
as
it
will
quench
it
wont
inspire
poetry
or
launch
a

but
it
may
just
hit
the
spot
if
its
summer
your
thirsty
have
to
drive
home
but
just
one
o
unexpectedly
good
for
a
fruit
beer
although
admittedly
the
bar
is
set
rather
low
bring
it
back
overall
youve
probably
got
a
friend
who
likes
dumb
fruit
macros
like
bud
light
lime
and
whatever
raspberita
is
and
whathaveyou
id
say
hand
them
one
of
these
its

and
fun
and
has
some

appeal
its

pours
clear
yellow
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
now
announced
as
discontinued
so
this
is
my
farewell
bottle
no
noticeable
hop
or
malt
profile
but
the
blackberries
remain
restrained
and
it
finishes
dry
and
crisp
ideal
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
if
we
are
honest
this
beer
at
110
calories
and
4
abv
is
light
years
better
than
any
mass
produced
light
beer
its
better
than
some
new
session
ipas
too
and
many
other
fruitwheat
craft
beers
sadly
it
lacks
the
hops
to
sell
anymore
and
so
must
be
retired
i
wonder
what
will
take
its
place
as
a
bridge
beer
o
keeping
in
mind
that
i
do
not
like
fruit
beers
this
one
does
what
its
set
out
to
do
i
could
easily
drink
5
of
these
without
feeling
a
thing
as
it
doesnt
even
feel
like
4
abv
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
extremely
refreshing
as
far
as
flavored
wheat
beers
go
this
one
was
almost
too
good
long
trail
has
definitely
nailed
this
recipe
very
good
as
a
post
skiing
or
hiking
beer
or
even
for
after
eating
i
suggest
it
be
served
around
40
degrees
it
seems
to
be
as
good
out
of
the
tap
in
a
glass
as
it
is
in
a
bottle
so
dont
worry
about
that
but
make
sure
you
havent
had
a
dark
beer
before
this
it
diminishes
the
taste
really
one
of
the
better
flavored
beers
ive
ever
had
and
100
worth
taking
sip
of
if
youre
just
coming
from
a
fun
outdoor
sport
o
like
i
said
im
biased
to
me
blackbeary
wheat
is
just
the
beer
that
flatlander
college
students
at
uvm
drink
to
look
cool
because
they
cant
stomach
a
long
trail
ale
this
seems
to
me
a
poor
example
of
a
poorly
made
light
beer
masquerading
as
something
refined
and
special
and
like
i
said
dont
get
me
wrong
i
had
my
long
trail
phase
and
i
would
never
turn
down
their
ale
double
bag
or
anything
elseexcept
for
this
try
it
for
yourself
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
respectable
wellmade
craft
beer
id
look
elsewhere
had
this
from
the
bottle
out
of
the
long
trail
summer
mix
pack
the
concept
of
fruit
beer
is
frankly
a
bit
feminine
inherently
to
me
but
i
like
this
one
its
a
bit
of
a
guilty
pleasure
the
blackberry
finish
is
not
too
strong
and
barely
sweet
nice
on
a
cooler
august
afternoon
the
color
is
darker
for
a
wheat
nothing
special
with
that
or
the
mouthfeel
one
of
long
trails
more
original
and
better
offerings
the
label
is
cool
too
if
that
matters
to
you
the
taste
also
expresses
itself
loudly
with
blackberries
which
i
happen
to
love
grains
herbs
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
clean
finish
very
nice
for
the
style
the
pale
yelloworange
liquid
pours
nicely
with
moderate
quickly
dissipating
head
moderate
carbonation
the
smell
is
somewhat
offputting
with
a
distinct
but
faint
presence
of
rotten
fruit
the
odor
is
likely
stronger
when
the
beer
is
not
chilled
to
38f
but
id
be
hardpressed
to
describe
it
as
aroma
this
only
gets
worse
when
you
taste
it
although
not
overwhelming
the
constant
presence
of
musty
blackgrape
flavor
is
distracting
and
bothersome
but
is
clearly
meant
to
be
a
feature
the
rest
of
the
flavor
is
missing
in
action
taste
more
like
flavored
mineral
water
with
a
drop
of
cheap
vodka
in
some
parallel
universe
it
may
give
leinie
a
run
for
its
moneybut
not
in
mine
and
i
cant
drink
leinie
with
a
straight
face
this
alone
would
make
me
think
twice
about
buying
lt
i
was
initially
unimpressed
with
lt
festival
samples
but
wanted
to
give
them
a
full
try
this
appears
to
be
the
worst
of
mediocre
lineup
the
fruit
doesnt
amount
to
much
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
fruit
beer
its
not
interesting
or
refreshing
enough
to
be
a
good
quaff
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
whole
foods
in
washington
dc
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
developed
a
full
airy
head
which
was
white
to
off
white
lacing
was
good
and
foam
lasted
for
a
short
time
aroma
was
fruity
and
sweet
with
slight
gum
notes
appearence
was
clear
and
golden
tast
was
sweet
and
fruity
like
berries
mouthfeel
was
light
and
clean
overall
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
going
on
but
what
flavor
is
there
isnt
bad
id
grab
this
over
a
mass
produced
light
lager
any
day
overall
for
a
light
refreshing
brew
this
brew
is
one
of
the
best
this
is
my
goto
brew
when
i
can
get
it
over
lighter
alternatives
that
lack
depth
and
flavor
i
definitely
prefer
this
ontap
the
beer
pours
kristelweiss
clear
and
yellow
like
some
very
clean
dehydrated
pee
the
head
on
top
is
huge
and
snow
white
with
finely
packed
bubbles
but
a
lumpy
exterior
the
beers
body
is
as
clean
as
a
hospital
with
a
light
torrent
of
carbonation
bubbles
working
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
is
medium
to
thick
sticky
and
quite
patchy
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
damp
wheat
with
a
light
spice
note
and
plenty
of
tart
and
syrupy
sweet
blackberry
smells
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
cleanly
of
wheat
bread
and
sweet
black
berries
the
beer
begins
with
damp
and
bitter
bland
wheat
before
opening
into
a
more
welcoming
biscuity
flavor
with
a
very
light
spice
from
the
yeast
and
then
crescendoing
with
the
syrupy
blackberry
taste
that
is
sweet
and
pleasing
the
close
of
the
beer
is
far
more
pleasant
than
the
opening
with
light
lingering
wheat
flavors
and
a
very
light
sweet
tang
of
blackberries
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
very
clean
and
of
a
lighter
body
with
some
very
nice
velvety
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
refreshing
kick
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
mouth
is
left
a
little
dry
and
sticky
strangely
but
the
throat
is
left
feeling
quite
refreshed
overall
this
is
a
light
fruit
beer
that
i
really
dont
mind
drinking
a
lot
of
longtrails
website
says
this
beer
originated
from
the
concept
of
belgiums
lambic
beers
but
i
see
it
as
far
more
akin
to
a
crisp
kellerweiss
and
i
think
they
should
start
marketing
it
that
way
the
beer
is
great
for
a
summer
day
when
you
want
something
a
little
sweet
to
refresh
the
tongue
clear
pour
very
very
light
not
surprising
berry
odor
comes
forth
but
not
very
distinctive
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
the
malt
flavors
are
nice
for
a
light
wheat
beer
just
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
for
me
the
berry
flavor
isnt
distinct
enough
wish
it
had
a
more
unique
flavor
but
the
base
beer
is
very
nice
overall
it
is
a
staple
and
a
goto
nothing
incredibly
unique
but
it
would
definitely
be
a
treat
for
visitors
and
i
enjoy
it
more
than
other
fruity
beers
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
there
is
a
bitter
edge
to
the
beer
sharp
on
the
tongue
cleans
up
nicely
after
itself
seems
like
a
good
upgrade
for
the
light
beer
drinking
crowd
both
for
clean
flavor
profile
as
well
as
low
abv
thanks
again
to
woodychandler
for
his
large
supply
of
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
of
blueberries
taste
is
also
of
blueberry
although
not
sweet
some
wheat
tartness
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
they
kept
it
simple
and
didnt
try
to
make
it
too
complex
its
a
straightforward
fruit
beer
and
its
a
good
one
maybe
a
step
behind
sams
cherry
wheat
o
a
nice
wheat
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
left
me
wanting
a
little
more
flavor
o
a
dull
somewhat
lifeless
wheat
beer
with
some
nice
blackberry
taste
its
crisp
and
refreshing
properties
are
about
the
only
thing
it
has
going
for
it
its
the
kind
of
beer
id
chug
in
lieu
of
water
after
a
long
run
on
a
hot
day
not
bad
for
a
lawnmower
beer
i
suppose
but
if
you
expect
anything
more
from
it
you
will
be
sorely
disappointed
the
crack
startled
me
as
it
was
another
craft
can
filled
to
the
brim
and
foaming
up
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
i
went
with
an
initial
inverted
glug
resulting
in
two
fingers
of
massive
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
faintly
of
berries
and
i
remember
this
being
a
knock
against
this
beer
not
enough
ooomph
in
terms
of
its
fruitiness
mouthfeel
was
light
not
watery
but
close
and
the
lightness
of
the
fruit
combined
nicely
with
the
inherent
tang
of
the
wheat
but
i
just
felt
like
it
had
been
dialed
down
from
what
it
could
have
been
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
which
may
be
appropriate
for
the
beach
but
i
just
was
not
feelin
it
overall
im
really
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
so
i
dont
know
why
i
bother
buying
them
i
will
say
that
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
and
if
for
some
reason
all
of
the
beers
in
the
world
had
fruit
in
them
id
buy
this
one
again
the
rest
im
not
a
huge
fruit
beer
guy
but
this
one
isnt
too
bad
its
still
a
one
and
done
for
me
but
its
a
decent
wheat
with
a
fairly
balanced
fruit
finish
very
light
in
color
and
fruity
got
it
in
a
sampler
pack
and
would
probably
never
purchase
this
beer
alone
it
was
worth
a
try
but
nothing
special
imo
this
is
underrated
on
ba
no
doubt
pours
a
brightly
bubbling
golden
color
with
a
short
white
head
smell
can
be
a
little
offputting
at
first
with
a
decaying
berry
kind
of
weird
fermenty
smell
i
think
it
smells
like
fresh
summer
beer
but
thats
just
me
flavor
is
what
its
all
about
and
this
tastes
good
lots
of
light
wheat
malt
and
a
healthy
dose
of
fresh
berries
on
the
back
end
not
as
all
sweet
i
think
its
an
amazingly
well
balanced
fruit
beer
in
a
summer
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
huge
factor
and
i
like
the
lighter
body
and
active
carbonation
of
this
easy
drinker
its
one
after
the
other
all
day
with
these
you
need
a
beer
like
that
sometimes
good
stuff
in
my
book
this
is
a
thin
as
in
no
body
even
a
blue
moon
has
more
substance
watery
brew
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
surprises
me
as
i
got
no
sense
of
hops
with
my
first
smell
id
let
this
one
go
by
if
your
looking
for
fruit
try
a
blue
point
blueberry
o
i
like
blackberries
but
they
seemed
to
be
trying
to
blend
in
too
well
in
this
beer
being
a
fruitvegetable
beer
i
thought
they
would
come
out
a
bit
more
still

i
decided
against
having
any
more
of
these
that
were

beer
seems
best

for
someone
who
enjoys
hard
lemonade
and
other
offerings
in

it
does
have
a
great

blackberry
aroma
to
it

is
very
appealing
this
would
be
nice
on

i
felt
that
the
sweet
malts
could
have
been
a
little
more
robust
for

ingredients
ill

moving
along
i
think
this
one
failed
to
deliver
pours
a

this
is
a
filtered
wheat
beer
with
a
modest
head
and
little
retention
or
lacing
no
real
fruit
smell
whatsoever
and
minimal
carbonation
there
was
a
tiny
hint
of
fruit
in
the

the
first
sip
hits
you
with
some

and

the

but

enough

this

a

just
a

there
are

beers
out
there
is
average
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
average
in
addition
to
the
blackberry
the
beer
is
watery
and
bland
with
a
slight
bubble
gum
taste
that
it
imparts
as
the
beer
warms
like
most
fruit
beers
it
goes
down
easily
and
is
gone
before
you
realize

there
is

the

is
more

petes

blond
the
majority
of
the
flavor
is
like
a
mix
between
a
pilsner
and
a
wheat
ale
but
nothing
all
that
interesting
i
was
hoping
for
some
nice
yeasty
and
wheaty
flavor
but
the
great
berry
scent
was
hardly
evident
in
the
flavor
beer
seemed
flat
and
the
flavor
just
as
the
bottle
suggests
in
addition
simply
put
i
adore
this
beer
it
is
my
goto
for
a
warm
summer
day
the
strawberry
and
raspberry
notes
are
reminiscent
of
a
glass
of
good
red
wine
cant
get
enough
and
for
7
its
amazingly
drinkable
enjoy
it
fresh
from
the
brew
pub
in
bottle
at
times
get
sour
taste
when
i
first
had
one
i
was
dazzled
by
the
taste
and
the
abv
the
fruitness
is
good
but
as
some
have
said
the
taste
can
get
old
after
awhile
while
it
tastes
fruity
this
is
a
good
choice

poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
purplish
hue
with
a
slightly
pinky
thin
head
a
few
strands
of
bubbles
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
fruity
definitely
could
pick
up
berries
predominant
to
me
was
blueberry
with
hints
of
other
berries
as
well
taste
was
somewhat
similar
to
the
smell
a
bit
of
sweet
berry
flavor
that
shifted
to
a
more
grainy
finish
the
grain
flavor
didnt
mix
terribly
well
with
the
berry
some
times
it
was
much
more
pronounced
than
others
thankfully
the
berry
wasnt
overly
sweet
or
powerful
it
was
fairly
subtle
and
balanced
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
but
seemed
a
bit
over
carbonated
too
many
bubbles
were
felt
on
the
tongue
overall
one
of
the
more
successful
beers
at
tasting
what
it
claims
to
the
grainy
finish
was
a
bit
distracting
though
overall
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
i
like
using
the
rye
to
balance
out
the
fruit
to
give
the
beer
multiple
dimensions
way
up
there
in
both
fruit
beers
and
rye
beers
underrated
overall
while
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruity
beer
for
what
it
is
this
is
perfect
for
the
style
not
too
fruity
but
enough
character
to
make
me
want
to
classify
this
as
well
not
really
a
beer
i
would
recommend
this
basically
to
any
women
who
likes
those
fruity
beers
as
this
is
a
top
notch
well
balanced
version
of
the
style
like
purple
bag
of
skittles
mixed
with
coors
light
wouldnt
recommend
or
try
again
but
then
again
not
a
fan
or
fruity
beers
but
overall
too
much
fruit
to
discern
any
specific
flavors
reminiscent
of
trix
cereal
due
to
not
being
able
to
tell
what
flavor
this
beer
was
willing
to
take
on
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
tried
i
dont
really
know
what
to
think
of
this
one
it
was
decent
and
easy
to
drink
but
at
the
same
time
very
one
dimensional
meh
as
a
regular
imbiber
of
colt
45
and
molson
xxx
i
think
i
know
my
buzz
factors
and
i
am
sure
if
you
are
at
this
site
you
know
it
is
not
easy
to
achieve
such
a
high
in
manufacture
especially
when
taste
is
the
main
objective
just
sayin
im
writing
this
review
in
case
anyone
reads
it
before
buying
this
beer
it
tastes
exactly
like
a
wine
cooler
in
a
blind
taste
test
im
not
sure
if
i
could
tell
the
difference
it
is
fermented
with
blackberries
blueberries
raspberries
and
strawberries
youve
been
warned
o
just
ok
drinkable
but
not
wowing
me
either
misses
the
mark
a
bit
with
some
off
flavors
and
a
fruitiness
that
doesnt
quite
complement
the
base
beer
the
base
seems
to
be
where
the
flaws
are
and
the
fruit
just
cant
compensate
enough
nowhere
near
the
top
of
the
list
for
shorts
beers
at
least
for
me
berry
madness
the
abv
strength
can
be
felt
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
adds
a
nice
edge
to
the
heavy
fruit
feel
nothing
artificial
about
this
one
but
it
does
remind
me
of
a
good
fruit
juice
mix
mdo
a
fun
drink
is
well
suited
for
the
summertimes
plenty
of
nice
flavor
the
malts
arent
my
thing
but
the
quality
is
there
odloved
this
beer
drinks
like
a
5
brew
the
flavors
are
natural
and
delicious
kicking
myself
for
only
buying
a
single
and
not
the
whole
sixer
raspberries
o
if
i
were
the
brewer
i
would
have
chalked
this
on
up
as
a
loss
it
tastes
like
a
homebrew
experiment
i
tried
once
long
ago
where
i
added
frozen
fruit
juice
concentrate
to
the
boil
the
beer
pours
a
murky
berry
red
with
accents
of
brown
syrup
and
touches
of
salmon
orange
the
head
is
eggshell
white
with
light
pink
highlights
and
the
lacing
is
thin
but
sticky
and
dry
the
beers
body
is
surprisingly
clear
of
particles
and
quite
translucent
featuring
a
steady
stream
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
on
the
nose
the
beer
is
big
and
jammy
with
lovely
thick
berry
scents
and
an
excellent
barley
malt
and
rye
spice
background
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
assorted
berry
scents
in
that
no
individual
berries
can
really
be
picked
out
without
really
shoving
your
nose
in
the
glass
the
malt
smells
of
light
biscuity
caramel
bread
and
has
me
thinking
rye
toast
and
jam
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
terrifically
sweet
with
berries
while
the
more
spicy
bread
malts
balance
the
sweet
and
a
touch
of
hops
adds
slight
earthy
bitters
the
flavor
begins
with
a
big
rush
of
fruit
berries
moving
from
strawberry
to
blueberry
to
black
berry
and
to
raspberry
nearly
so
fast
that
the
tongue
has
trouble
differentiating
between
them
the
berry
flavor
powers
through
the
mouth
throughout
the
taste
building
to
a
crescendo
that
tastes
a
little
syrupy
and
then
fading
into
the
aftertaste
but
beside
the
berries
there
is
a
strong
underlying
flavor
of
spicy
rye
bread
and
caramel
malt
which
eventually
brings
the
light
earthy
bitters
onto
the
back
of
the
palate
the
aftertaste
rings
lightly
with
strawberry
jam
faint
earthy
bitters
and
a
touch
of
aspirin
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
in
body
with
some
nice
syrupy
qualities
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
clean
with
the
slightest
dry
feeling
on
the
tongue
the
beers
carbonation
is
light
with
effervescence
providing
a
slight
prickle
across
the
tongue
as
it
moves
down
the
throat
the
beer
feels
clean
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
nonwild
fruit
beers
its
big
in
booze
and
in
fruit
flavors
but
still
lets
you
know
there
is
beer
beneath
it
and
it
blends
those
two
things
very
nicely
it
has
nice
the
rye
flavors
underlying
the
heavy
jam
and
definitely
has
some
semblance
to
a
fruit
wine
which
is
nicely
refreshing
this
beer
would
be
great
for
summer
nights
and
is
really
a
nice
beer
try
it
overall
i
guess
that
i
am
spoiled
with
all
the
new
glarus
fruit
beers
i
have
tried
apple
ale
belgian
red
raspberry
tart
and
serendipity
so
i
have
a
fairely
good
idea
of
what
the
best
fruits
beers
are
all
about
this
beer
isnt
horrible
but
it
is
definately
a
little
bit
odd
in
my
mind
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
beer
called
pink
killer
and
its
a
bit
of
an
improvement
from
that
beer
it
is
hard
to
finish
the
12oz
bottle
i
bet
dan
carey
could
make
an
amazing
fruit
beer
from
the
4
berries
that
are
used
to
brew
this
beer
o
i
never
expect
much
from
fruit
beers
but
this
exceeded
my
low
expectations
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
however
i
could
not
see
myself
having
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
o
ah
its
alright
i
was
expecting
much
more
more
tartness
and
flavor
but
its
not
bad
i
can
see
why
the
moniker
on
the
lable
offers
favorable
comparisons
to
wine
but
in
the
end
its
a
pleasant
fruit
beer
thats
best
enjoyed
with
a
freshly
mowed
lawn
this
pours
a
semiclear
reddish
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
scent
is
fruity
but
its
not
as
strong
as
you
would
think
for
the
style
of
beer
the
taste
is
kind
of
a
disaster
with
the
clash
of
fruit
with
the
high
gravity
ale
this
essentially
tastes
like
a
cheap
40
that
someone
dumped
day
old
fruit
juice
in
its
hard
to
pick
out
the
blueberries
strawberries
raspberries
and
blackberries
this
is
something
they
really
need
to
take
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
i
think
eliminating
the
high
gravity
ale
is
a
starting
place
finishes
with
a
slight
raspberry
taste
and
chalky
after
taste
i
tried
but
couldnt
get
into
this
beer
like
many
of
my
friends
its
tasty
but
when
i
want
a
beer
its
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
not
beer
enough
to
be
a
good
fruit
beer
and
not
authentic
or
sour
enough
to
be
a
lambic
the
9
abv
is
covered
up
very
well
as
almost
no
alcohol
is
detectable
but
i
will
probably
pass
on
this
brew
next
time
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
at
a
party
it
always
turns
out
to
be
a
hit
and
its
reasonably
inexpensive
811
6
pack
overall
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
the
flavors
are
rather
subdued
but
theres
no
denying
theres
a
lot
of
berry
in
this
very
refreshing
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
timetotime
during
hot
days
drink
shorts
well
you
got
me
on
this
one
not
their
best
offering
but
just
fell
short
sweet
like
and
muddled
poured
a
pinkishpurple
gemstone
sort
of
color
with
a
briefly
active
fizzy
1cm
head
that
settles
down
with
no
real
lacing
smells
and
tastes
of
dry
raspberry
and
strawberry
essence
with
a
much
smaller
amount
of
the
blueberries
in
the
background
and
a
sort
of
musty
earthiness
framing
it
all
that
i
presume
comes
from
the
rye
malt
stays
dry
and
crisp
throughout
light
body
and
carbonation
levels
abv
levels
are
very
well
hidden
it
could
use
a
bit
of
tartness
or
a
touch
of
acidity
to
help
make
the
dryness
of
it
all
more
interesting
overall
impression
lives
up
to
the
bill
soft
on
all
the
fruit
flavors
and
still
retains
all
the
characteristics
that
youd
hope
for
in
a
beer
without
losing
its
identity
well
done
musical
pairing
gerry
raffertys
right
down
the
line
o
really
not
all
that
bad
not
my
first
choice
for
sure
not
my
last
a
good
summer
relaxation
beer
that
is
a
crowd
pleaser
and
high
abv
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
and
it
has
grown
on
me
its
one
of
my
fiances
favorites
so
i
usually
leave
her
to
drink
them
but
ive
been
tearing
into
a
six
pack
over
the
past
couple
days
it
pours
a
pinkish
amber
color
fairly
unique
looking
with
a
small
pinkish
white
head
its
certainly
not
a
manly
looking
pour
nice
fruity
nose
mixed
berries
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
hops
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
that
is
supported
by
a
bit
of
bitterness
i
thought
it
was
a
little
thin
and
could
probably
stand
for
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
make
it
a
bit
more
on
the
refreshing
side
for
the
lightness
i
do
like
the
taste
its
grown
on
me
with
each
pour
its
strong
on
the
berries
particularly
strawberry
its
not
too
sweet
and
has
a
nice
bitter
backbone
pleasant
overall
a
nice
change
but
definitely
more
alcohol
than
i
would
choose
for
a
summer
session
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
its
refreshing
and
certainly
helps
beat
the
heat
definitely
worth
a
shot
but
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
o
very
unique
and
enjoyable
thanks
shorts
o
this
beer
is
outstanding
for
what
it
is
and
it
is
a
novelty
in
the
world
of
fruit
beers
this
one
really
gets
it
right
there
is
not
much
hops
flavor
and
this
really
lets
the
fruit
come
through
and
do
its
thing
this
is
more
like
a
barley
wine
with
a
fruit
kick
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
just
to
taste
a
well
crafted
fruit
beer
it
is
fun
to
experience
the
braod
range
of
fermented
beverages
that
can
be
called
beer
this
is
a
decent
fruit
beer
light
enough
for
many
to
enjoy
but
full
flavored
enough
to
satisfy
my
tastes
the
last
time
i
ordered
this
my
friends
teased
me
for
drinking
a
beer
that
looked
like
cherry
7up
whos
laughing
now
ahem
now
that
ive
brought
some
bottles
to
share
with
a
group
of
friends
who
loved
it
this
is
a
real
crowd
pleaser
that
im
happy
to
say
i
enjoy
as
well
o
this
one
was
interesting
but
i
couldnt
get
through
it
i
am
admittedly
not
big
on
fruit
beers
in
the
first
place
so
i
have
kept
hat
in
mind
with
my
ratings
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
7152011
pours
a
fairly
hazy
reddish
orange
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
fairly
dense
pinkish
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
nice
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
tart
raspberries
strawberry
blackberry
cherry
and
spices
nice
and
pleasant
fruit
aromas
with
nice
complexity
taste
of
lightly
tart
raspberry
blackberry
cherry
strawberry
pepper
clove
and
herbal
spiciness
lingering
notes
of
raspberry
strawberry
pepper
clove
and
herbal
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
nice
balance
of
fruit
flavors
with
spiciness
and
a
nice
bit
of
tartness
to
round
it
out
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
slightly
prickly
carbonation
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
at
8
with
hardly
any
alcohol
warming
after
the
finish
very
smooth
to
drink
but
is
still
a
bit
of
a
sipper
overall
this
fruit
beer
was
a
lot
more
enjoyable
than
i
was
expecting
nice
balance
of
all
flavors
with
good
complexity
and
very
smooth
to
drink
as
well
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
this
one
was
pretty
good
definitely
not
my
normal
style
but
very
unique
picked
this
up
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
i
cant
get
it
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
but
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
average
beer
i
expected
more
out
of
this
beer
but
it
was
still
worth
trying
it
did
hide
the
alcohol
well
so
you
have
to
pace
yourself
on
this
one
o
i
anticipated
this
beer
tasting
like
a
wine
cooler
with
double
the
alcohol
it
was
fruity
but
maintained
some
beerlike
elements
from
the
rye
and
barley
some
of
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
slightly
outofwhack
but
i
appreciated
the
effort
not
great
but
not
terrible
my
girlfriend
would
like
it
more
than
i
did
overall
liked
this
a
lot
and
could
drink
it
all
day
or
untill
i
pass
out
on
a
park
bench
overall
from
some
reviews
i
expected
way
too
sweet
fruit
juice
aspects
but
got
a
smooth
fruit
beer
thats
tart
with
little
actual
beer
flavor
but
just
enough
malt
and
carbonation
to
make
it
enjoyable
cant
wait
to
try
their
other
offerings
o
if
you
are
looking
for
a
traditional
beer
with
extremely
subtle
hints
this
beer
is
not
for
you
if
you
want
a
unique
beer
that
tastes
like
fruit
punch
and
is
refreshing
try
the
soft
parade
d
i
cannot
believe
the
stated
abv
on
this
beer
it
is
just
so
fresh
and
refreshing
a
bit
dangerous
really
if
this
is
your
mug
o
beer
it
is
exceedingly
drinkable
for
me
though
fruity
dessert
sweet
beers
are
sort
of
one
and
doen
but
it
is
one
super
nice
treat
o
not
really
my
thing
but
i
can
see
why
its
such
a
hit
with
the
ladies
its
a
cheerleader
beer
thats
actually
half
beer
and
not
just
malt
beverage
it
is
what
it
is
d
very
drinkable
i
rally
like
just
how
sweet
and
tart
it
is
and
how
strong
the
fruit
flavor
is
it
also
finishes
really
strong
with
some
great
flavor
soft
parade
is
a
solid
fruit
beer
that
features
an
interesting
mix
of
berry
flavors
overall
really
great
beer
considering
the
price
and
availability
of
this
one
id
pick
it
up
quite
often
whenever
i
wanted
a
tart
treat
saw
a
sixer
of
this
its
from
shorts
its
high
gravity
and
its
a
fruit
beer
had
to
pick
one
up
to
try
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
soft
parade
is
a
hazy
brownishred
color
with
a
thin
soapy
white
head
the
nose
is
unmistakably
berries
mostly
blueberries
some
raspberries
and
a
faint
hint
of
strawberry
the
taste
has
a
similar
berry
profile
with
an
unexpected
bitternesstartness
that
doesnt
complement
the
beer
there
is
a
faint
malty
backdrop
but
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
body
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
worth
trying
im
still
impressed
that
its
9
because
it
is
not
noticable
but
not
one
i
will
be
searching
out
in
the
future
o
overall
if
it
were
not
for
the
9
abv
i
would
have
poured
it
down
the
drain
but
needing
to
level
out
after
working
till
midnight
drank
it
down
like
a
seditive
overall
not
a
bad
brew
very
tasty
fruitiness
without
being
cloying
at
all
my
wife
noted
that
it
was
a
bit
too
bitter
and
dry
for
her
liking
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
this
probably
would
have
been
a
better
selection
in
the
summer
it
goes
down
real
easy
which
could
cause
problems
given
the
abv
many
thanks
to
kzoobrew
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
kevin
said
that
this
used
to
be
called
ye
old
panty
dropper
before
it
got
bottled
after
pouring
i
can
see
why
poured
from
bottle
into
boulevard
tulip
pours
a
rich
raspberry
color
nearly
transparent
nearly
no
head
on
it
smell
tart
strawberries
raspberries
powdered
sugar
juicy
fruitkoolade
concentrate
definitely
a
candy
nose
to
it
a
bit
artificial
i
read
in
previous
reviews
that
it
resembles
a
sour
on
the
nose
i
couldnt
disagree
more
no
sourness
here
it
is
all
candy
sweet
taste
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
there
is
the
blueberries
it
doesnt
manifest
itself
on
the
nose
at
all
but
it
presents
itself
at
the
front
of
the
palate
strawberry
sweetness
on
mid
palate
rich
carbonation
makes
for
a
dry
finish
distracts
from
the
sweet
nature
of
this
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
although
i
probably
lost
man
points
drinking
it
this
is
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
tart
on
the
flavor
with
a
fair
dose
of
alcohol
and
rotting
fruit
low
on
the
sweetness
and
actually
drinks
a
little
more
like
a
sour
than
a
fruit
beer
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
one
gets
better
as
it
warms
this
is
a
fine
brew
that
i
wish
i
had
access
to
on
a
regular
basis
the
nose
and
pour
of
this
had
me
thinking
infection
at
first
but
now
im
not
so
sure
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
sour
funky
and
fruity
o
best
shorts
to
date
b
to
a
for
sure
if
a
fan
of
the
funk
and
sours
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
shorts
their
yeast
strain
works
much
better
with
a
beer
like
this
than
traditional
offerings
taste
is
nicer
than
i
remember
still
light
but
pleasant
some
faint
blackberry
notes
and
again
earthiness
is
present
thin
mouthfeel
with
little
noticeable
carbonation
a
bit
watery
no
noticeable
alcohol
at
all
overall
not
too
bad
not
sure
if
this
would
really
appeal
to
wine
drinkers
like
the
initial
goal
was
i
wish
this
was
fruited
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
is
good
a
medium
body
edging
on
the
lighter
side
with
some
carbonation
its
crisp
up
front
and
smooth
in
the
middle
making
for
easy
drinking
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
shorts
offerings
but
so
far
my
impressions
have
been
all
over
the
map
this
one
im
not
all
that
into
its
just
decent
and
not
much
more
i
feel
like
its
aiming
for
something
somewhere
between
a
tart
belgian
fruit
beer
and
those
great
samuel
smith
fruit
ales
but
not
quite
getting
there
o
this
beer
is
ok
i
can
appreciate
and
enjoy
a
fruit
beer
more
than
most
bas
but
this
was
too
heavy
and
alcoholic
the
fruitiness
was
definitely
there
in
full
force
but
also
had
some
flavors
to
keep
it
from
being
refreshing
and
enjoyable
not
terrible
just
not
great
o
this
beer
is
decent
and
enjoyable
strong
fruity
berries
flavors
upfront
with
a
slight
sourness
the
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
for
being
9
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
it
does
the
job
im
a
big
fan
of
shorts
brewing
company
unfortunately
soft
parade
is
one
of
their
weaker
releases
its
not
a
total
disaster
but
the
fruit
flavor
seems
to
be
lighter
than
it
should
it
also
just
works
okay
with
the
flavors
its
not
exactly
a
symphonic
masterpiece
shorts
is
a
fantastic
brewery
this
is
not
one
of
their
stronger
releases
its
just
okay
if
youre
into
fruit
beers
you
might
like
it
just
my
02
its
nice
the
way
that
the
different
fruit
flavors
come
together
to
form
a
synergy
this
is
similar
to
the
way
that
a
juice
blend
can
form
a
more
complex
flavor
than
any
individual
juice
the
flavor
is
more
subtle
than
many
fruit
ales
but
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
a
light
refreshing
summer
drink
big
thanks
goes
out
to
funkydelic
for
sharing
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
vibrant
redorange
with
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
berries
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
and
a
shitton
of
berries
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
alcohol
on
this
one
was
very
well
hidden
behind
the
massive
onslaught
of
berries
that
it
created
however
i
happen
to
like
fresh
berries
from
timetotime
so
this
brew
really
suited
my
palate
quite
well
so
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
berries
avoid
at
all
costs
if
you
are
you
have
to
try
this
od
initial
pour
had
me
pulling
for
this
one
however
that
ended
up
being
the
best
part
some
sips
showed
promise
especially
as
it
warmed
but
not
enough
coming
through
to
make
it
stand
out
the
mouthfeel
is
particularly
pleasant
the
lasting
flavour
varying
throughout
for
a
beer
as
dry
as
this
one
the
carbonation
allows
for
a
smooth
and
refreshing
brew
which
goes
down
quite
easily
i
wish
i
had
some
fresh
goat
cheese
and
cranberry
preserve
on
hand
lighter
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
present
and
adds
some
warmth
a
very
interesting
beer
here
overall
this
beer
is
as
delicious
as
wayne
coyne
is
positive
ive
always
said
if
i
could
be
related
to
any
celebrity
it
would
be
wayne
coyne
hes
just
a
stand
up
classy
guy
this
is
a
stand
up
tasty
beer
i
wish
i
could
come
by
soft
parade
more
readily
here
in
ct
but
i
cant
so
my
dream
to
have
wayne
coyne
as
an
uncle
is
only
slightly
less
realistic
than
me
finding
more
of
this
beer
nearby
this
beer
poured
out
as
an
pinkish
orange
codor
with
a
pinkish
white
head
on
top
that
had
a
really
good
retention
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
fruity
similar
to
a
wine
cooler
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
rye
in
it
which
i
didnt
realize
until
i
read
that
on
here
now
that
im
aware
of
the
rye
being
in
there
i
can
now
place
the
taste
or
feeling
i
was
getting
in
the
beginning
of
each
sip
the
other
flavors
are
dominated
by
the
sweet
wine
like
fruit
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
its
well
carbonated
and
kind
of
refreshing
overall
i
think
that
its
decent
but
not
my
favorite
final
thought
get
this
one
any
way
you
can
received
a
bunch
of
shorts
beers
as
extras
time
to
do
the
lineup
first
pour
is
the
soft
parade
bubbles
shoot
around
in
the
pour
but
almost
no
head
appears
simply
a
pithy
white
foam
reduces
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
color
is
vibrant
deep
red
with
a
burnt
orange
tint
aromas
have
a
touch
of
tart
berry
fruit
smells
like
a
really
light
lambic
flavor
is
mild
and
lightly
acidic
flavors
of
earth
and
berries
light
overall
but
satisfying
finish
is
lingering
with
and
herbal
earth
note
fruit
dissapears
quickly
overall
a
solid
brew
full
bodied
but
mild
fruit
flavors
interesting
if
you
like
fruity
beers
youll
enjoy
this
if
fruit
isnt
your
thing
youll
hate
it
i
liked
it
not
the
tastiest
fruit
beer
ive
had
but
pretty
good
however
the
cloying
sweetness
and
kind
of
one
dimensional
flavor
prevent
it
from
being
overly
drinkable
overall
i
kind
of
had
low
expectations
coming
into
this
one
but
i
was
actually
pleasantly
surprised
this
fruity
concoction
actually
kinds
the
high
abv
very
well
and
i
only
get
a
few
mild
hints
of
the
alcohol
when
it
really
warms
up
great
sweet
fruity
flavours
on
the
aromas
that
really
come
through
in
the
tastes
you
can
almost
taste
every
single
berry
added
at
one
point
or
another
when
drinking
one
of
these
i
definitely
have
a
soft
spot
for
fruit
beers
in
the
summer
and
this
is
close
to
the
top
of
the
list
of
fruit
beers
that
i
would
drink
although
probably
better
suited
for
your
girlfriend
this
is
a
quality
drinker
for
anybody
and
well
worth
a
try
and
i
rather
enjoyed
it
but
despite
the
beer
shes
still
my
good
sister
d
if
the
abv
is
correct
on
this
listing
i
could
see
how
this
could
be
a
deadly
little
brew
that
would
sneak
right
up
on
you
i
would
have
assumed
half
the
abv
if
i
were
guessing
a
tasty
little
brew
from
shorts
certainly
not
world
class
but
a
good
fruit
beer
to
quaff
on
a
hot
summer
night
medium
bodied
higher
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
definitely
another
unusual
shorts
beer
and
a
nice
use
of
fruit
without
turning
the
beer
into
a
complete
juice
cocktail
o
refreshing
but
a
touch
sweet
due
to
the
fruit
o
not
much
flavor
to
it
i
would
like
to
have
seen
more
fruit
flavors
poke
through
very
easy
to
drink
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
one
but
i
is
not
terrible
overall
interesting
concept
but
could
have
been
executed
a
little
better
as
i
said
before
make
this
a
sour
and
its
a
big
time
winner
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
would
certainly
be
more
of
a
non
craft
beer
drinkers
beer
as
it
tastes
more
along
the
lines
of
a
mixed
drink
o
as
listed
above
doesnt
really
fit
either
style
but
enjoyable
either
way
it
doesnt
really
say
its
a
particular
style
anyway
excellent
alcohol
hiding
and
nice
twist
on
a
belgian
style
ale
overall
a
great
beer
a
fruit
beer
that
i
didnt
feel
was
too
girly
or
too
mikes
hard
lemonade
very
well
done
by
the
guys
at
shorts
overall
this
would
make
a
great
dessert
beer
or
perhaps
even
a
drink
best
saved
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
appreciate
the
style
but
its
just
not
something
id
go
for
normally
glad
i
got
to
try
something
from
this
northern
mi
brewery
bottle
shared
at
the
may
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
a
blush
wine
color
with
an
airy
white
head
raspberries
and
strawberries
are
strong
on
the
nose
with
a
solid
tartness
yogurt
and
cheese
are
also
very
distinct
berry
yogurt
flavor
with
an
even
rye
maltiness
midpalate
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
still
a
little
noticeable
pours
a
murky
strawberry
jam
color
with
a
2
inch
light
red
head
that
fades
to
a
very
thin
cap
bubbly
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
this
beer
smells
like
various
berry
jams
some
mild
grain
smells
come
out
too
taste
is
also
of
various
berry
jams
with
some
grains
wheat
perhaps
there
is
a
bit
of
medicinal
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
carbonation
is
quite
high
and
has
a
very
prickly
feel
going
down
perhaps
a
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
fruit
smells
and
tastes
but
its
nothing
too
exciting
d
interesting
fruit
beer
to
say
the
least
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
a
fruit
taste
if
it
had
200
lbs
of
fruit
added
to
the
mix
it
reminded
me
of
a
fruit
spread
and
a
fruit
smoothie
almost
like
a
hybrid
between
the
two
i
have
really
been
looking
forward
to
trying
something
from
this
brewery
and
have
to
thank
pittsburghkid
for
the
opportunity
o
d
there
are
some
weird
flavors
in
here
that
do
not
fit
so
i
dont
care
that
much
for
this
beer
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
at
all
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
red
color
with
a
small
pinkish
head
aroma
is
of
quite
fruity
and
fairly
tart
the
raspberries
and
strawberries
are
what
i
smell
the
most
along
with
some
sugary
notes
the
flavor
is
slightly
tart
and
very
fruity
with
alot
of
raspberry
along
with
some
sugary
notes
and
the
9
abv
is
really
well
hidden
the
body
is
light
with
a
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
solid
fruit
beer
but
fruit
beers
like
this
arent
really
my
style
this
was
more
fruit
than
beer
imo
o
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
out
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
it
again
either
first
off
i
went
in
expecting
leinies
berryweiss
and
was
pleasantly
suprised
that
it
was
not
that
type
of
drink
it
is
nowhere
near
as
sweet
fruity
or
well
blatant
as
bw
a
nice
crisp
berry
scent
which
is
balanced
in
flavor
by
the
malt
i
can
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
at
the
beach
or
maybe
a
picnic
in
the
summer
is
it
a
chick
beer
maybe
is
it
strong
enough
to
knock
you
on
your
ass
if
you
underestimate
it
yep
its
not
zima
its
not
boones
farm
its
just
kinda
good
give
it
a
shot
a
reddish
pour
of
something
cloudy
with
a
very
little
reddish
head
of
three
fingers
nose
of
berry
and
grain
sort
of
a
jungle
juice
of
all
the
berries
with
no
particular
hints
of
alcohol
palate
is
strawberry
pulp
and
mild
crisp
of
dryness
great
fruit
and
summer
high
alcohol
beer
soft
fruit
tart
mild
wheat
husk
and
i
subtle
woody
bitterness
taste
is
thin
slightly
tart
and
finishes
like
kool
aid
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
i
expected
intense
fruit
flavour
or
typical
beer
flavours
accented
with
fruit
this
is
neither
its
thin
and
vaguely
sweet
almost
like
fruit
flavoured
diet
pop
it
has
9abv
and
doesnt
taste
like
much
at
all
if
i
tasted
this
blind
i
dont
think
i
would
even
guess
it
was
beer
its
not
an
unpleasant
drink
but
not
what
i
expected
from
any
sort
of
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
not
thin
and
carbonation
is
surprisingly
not
very
high
the
weight
is
just
right
and
the
finish
is
neutral
thanks
to
the
malts
just
a
bit
of
tingling
on
the
tongue
from
carbonationfruit
is
a
nice
touch
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
who
doesnt
like
fresh
fruit
it
isnt
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
either
really
great
beer
in
my
estimation
overall
meh
lots
of
fruit
too
fruity
a
bit
boozy
very
yeasty
too
drink
and
overall
honestly
this
is
like
the
tenth
time
ive
had
this
beer
i
am
now
ticking
it
i
thought
going
in
it
would
be
a
c
beer
but
i
think
im
going
a
little
higher
i
enjoyed
it
more
this
time
as
i
gave
it
time
to
develop
and
really
look
into
the
complex
body
good
work
again
joe
o
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
i
thought
the
berries
would
be
too
overpowering
when
i
originally
smelled
this
but
it
turned
out
to
be
nicely
balanced
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
through
trade
received
in
trade
from
jbck109
thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pink
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
recedes
slowly
but
sticks
itself
to
everything
in
site
smells
fruity
and
tart
non
descript
tart
fruit
is
really
all
i
can
find
in
the
nose
wheres
the
beer
taste
is
again
sweet
fruity
and
tart
i
get
lots
of
berries
in
the
taste
a
bit
of
sweet
sugar
in
a
relatively
dry
finish
bubbly
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
slick
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
well
this
isnt
horrible
i
could
drink
it
calling
this
beer
would
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
but
the
biggest
thing
is
i
find
this
boring
and
lacking
complexity
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
one
and
done
for
this
guy
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
shorts
the
advertised
rye
really
does
not
show
up
super
sweet
in
the
lines
of
leinies
berry
weiss
be
careful
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
my
least
favorite
from
shorts
so
far
d
looked
great
smelled
great
and
tasted
pretty
good
but
seemed
like
a
watered
down
glass
of
blush
wine
unique
but
not
really
my
thing
one
side
note
it
is
strange
for
a
company
that
seems
to
have
unusual
and
archaic
demands
for
the
freshness
of
their
product
to
not
feature
a
prominent
datecode
this
was
a
pretty
interesting
sidebyside
tasting
of
an
unconventional
beer
i
do
think
the
fresh
soft
parade
has
the
slight
edge
on
the
much
different
aged
version
but
i
did
think
it
was
pretty
interesting
that
the
yearold
example
took
on
some
belgianlike
characteristics
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
neither
was
fantastic
but
this
was
still
a
fun
experiment
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
absolutely
hidden
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
i
am
really
into
things
that
taste
like
this
that
are
not
beer
and
absolutely
loved
this
one
another
winner
from
shorts
very
good
beer
obviously
fruity
as
it
states
but
not
too
sweet
looked
perfect
when
i
poured
it
to
the
glass
from
bottle
nice
head
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
as
is
usual
with
shorts
love
their
stuff
cant
wait
to
visit
their
brewery
soon
to
try
out
other
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
murky
red
berry
color
surprise
surprise
its
a
little
bit
darker
than
strawberry
but
not
quite
raspberry
deep
red
the
head
has
a
slight
pink
hue
about
it
and
tops
out
at
about
two
fingers
in
height
retention
and
lacing
are
both
serviceable
but
ultimately
unimpressive
the
nose
is
essentially
pure
raspberry
with
just
a
little
bit
of
blueberry
added
to
the
mix
as
well
blackberry
finally
shines
through
as
it
dominates
the
flavor
giving
a
tangy
bitter
quality
to
the
beer
i
was
expectinghoping
for
a
little
more
sweetness
supporting
the
beer
as
well
as
a
more
vibrant
berry
flavor
the
body
is
impressively
and
necessarily
light
for
a
beer
its
size
as
the
thought
of
a
weighty
fruit
beer
isnt
a
pleasant
one
the
carbonation
though
is
a
bit
overbearing
and
distracts
some
from
the
fruity
flavors
trying
to
shine
through
the
soft
parade
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
suppose
i
had
higher
expectations
based
on
some
of
the
more
experimental
beers
theyve
brought
to
festivals

served
in
my
maudite
tulip
pours
a
bright
translucent
copper
with
a
half
inch
loose
offwhite
head
that
sizzles
and
pops
as
it
slowly
dissipates
into
a
broken
froth
and
a
creamy
band
around
the
shoulders
nose
is
musty
and
also
slightly
metallic
with
a
suggestion
of
fruit
syrup
towards
the
back
taste
not
great
tart
acidic
artificial
fruit
flavors
a
metallic
quality
and
some
bitterness
towards
the
finish
reminiscent
of
grapefruit
seed
extract
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
prickly
and
gassy
its
also
fairly
acidic
and
not
in
a
good
way
well
this
is
pretty
much
undrinkable
i
got
through
about
13
of
the
bottle
before
having
to
do
a
drain
pour
not
something
i
do
very
often
i
just
couldnt
get
through
this
one
still
spoiled
by
new
glarus
fruit
beers
drinkability
to
sweet
almost
like
drinking
to
many
fufu
drinks
i
will
say
though
i
can
not
tell
that
this
is
9
abv
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
the
abv
creeps
in
a
bit
after
awhile
this
is
very
drinkable
and
and
doesnt
seem
7
my
wife
loves
this
beer
so
i
buy
it
a
lot
it
certainly
took
me
a
while
to
finally
review
this
drinkability
i
think
the
fruit
and
the
sour
flavors
and
rye
in
this
one
clash
a
bit
that
being
said
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
brunch
beer
d
again
other
than
the
high
carbonation
i
enjoy
drinking
this
love
the
sharp
fruit
flavors
and
the
overall
quality
pretty
good
brew
pours
a
trasparent
darkcherry
pink
color
with
sizable
pinkish
white
head
smells
like
a
mixed
drink
like
a
cosmo
or
something
other
berrybooze
concoction
i
dont
really
have
any
idea
what
to
think
of
that
so
ill
evaluate
it
on
how
pleasant
we
found
it
which
was
a
pretty
mixed
bag
tastes
like
a
very
carbonated
fruit
puree
potpourri
there
is
a
bit
of
perfuminess
as
described
by
the
potpourri
flavor
that
is
not
plesant
sweet
but
not
overly
so
which
was
welcomed
it
as
certainly
interesting
but
really
didnt
come
together
for
us
we
did
not
finish
the
12
oz
bottle
between
3
people
the
mouthfeel
was
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
but
overcarbonated
the
somewhat
off
perfumey
flavor
limited
the
drinkability
outside
of
my
personal
bias
against
the
drinkability
fo
the
style
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
has
a
lot
of
character
the
seductive
color
and
pretty
pinkish
head
sweet
fruity
nose
and
crisp
tart
fruity
flavor
make
for
one
tasty
beer
that
has
both
lambic
and
winelike
qualities
overall
this
is
a
fruit
beer
that
i
think
appeals
well
to
both
men
and
women
as
its
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
dry
and
at
9abv
i
can
certainly
see
why
they
call
this
one
ye
olde
leg
spreader
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
i
find
the
problem
with
most
fruit
beers
is
that
the
fruit
flavor
is
either
too
weak
or
it
comes
off
as
artificial
this
beer
was
neither
this
would
make
a
good
gateway
beer
for
girls
looking
for
something
tasty
without
being
bombarded
by
hops
and
malts
great
job
shorts
keep
thinking
out
of
the
box
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
slightly
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
it
showed
some
nice
fruit
flavors
at
times
but
also
had
some
kind
off
bitter
sour
flavors
at
other
times
not
awful
but
at
the
same
time
not
that
great
either
given
the
off
flavors
i
thought
were
there
this
could
be
another
shorts
beer
that
has
problems
in
certain
bottlesconditions
but
who
knows
even
considering
this
beer
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
for
non
beer
drinkers
i
cant
get
behind
it
pours
with
no
head
at
all
pinkish
hue
i
get
all
the
bitterness
from
these
berries
but
none
of
the
sweetness
the
nose
is
of
sour
with
a
touch
of
fruit
neither
is
very
strong
it
is
taking
me
a
while
to
get
through
this
beer
an
interesting
experiment
of
a
beer
realizing
the
shorts
designed
this
for
women
who
dont
like
beer
i
find
it
ironic
that
they
basically
created
the
beer
version
of
arbor
mist
which
was
designed
for
people
who
dont
like
wine
but
are
too
classy
for
wine
coolers
faint
haze
nice
reddish
colour
with
a
short
cap
of
offwhite
foam
that
really
lingered
spotty
lace
berry
aroma
not
intense
but
quite
fruity
strawberries
raspberries
it
smells
red
with
a
little
earthiness
and
sweeter
fruit
notes
sort
of
like
a
fruit
punch
light
bitterness
balanced
the
fruity
sweetness
slight
sourness
more
berries
light
citrus
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
decent
texture
quite
tasty
and
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
this
beer
pours
a
muddied
dark
dark
crimson
in
color
with
no
head
it
looks
great
and
is
ultimately
cloudy
and
looks
delicious
it
smells
like
strawberry
jam
i
love
it
ive
never
smelled
anything
quite
like
this
one
i
especially
like
the
aromas
because
its
unique
but
it
is
exceptionally
sweet
as
far
as
aromas
are
concerned
the
flavor
is
far
too
subtle
i
expected
much
more
from
this
it
looks
spectacular
and
smells
amazing
yet
it
leaves
you
scratching
your
head
with
the
flavor
it
couldve
been
so
much
more
it
has
four
berries
heavily
feature
one
of
them
please
instead
its
like
a
watered
down
version
of
rubaeus
it
drinks
smoothly
and
has
good
carbonation
but
is
a
little
too
flat
this
beer
sounds
great
but
drinks
into
mediocrity
drinkability
intriguing
as
a
fruit
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
real
problem
i
dont
see
many
other
reviews
noting
the
overcarbonation
so
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
reviewed
on
1312010
bottle
thanks
to
thecheeseman
this
one
exploded
all
over
my
kitchen
however
i
was
able
to
save
about
half
the
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
red
with
a
thick
foamy
pink
head
aroma
of
a
mess
of
fruits
strawberry
blackberry
raspberry
flavor
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
strawberry
and
blackberry
decent
fruit
beer
certainly
better
than
some
although
the
palate
is
weak
were
going
for
this
beer
pours
with
alot
of
carbonation
as
expected
considering
all
the
different
berries
the
red
hues
is
a
nice
look
the
berry
taste
so
delightful
on
your
tongue
being
this
is
such
a
drinkable
beer
beware
of
the
results
after
too
many
thank
you
shorts
for
a
nice
beer
in
the
end
this
is
a
drain
pour
for
me
i
simply
have
no
desire
to
take
another
sip
pours
into
a
reddish
colored
body
with
a
thin
reddish
white
head
it
has
some
retention
little
lacing
and
decent
carbonation
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
smell
the
first
thing
that
hits
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
fruits
most
noticeable
is
strawberry
and
raspberry
like
smelling
some
homemade
jelly
or
jam
the
taste
is
a
fruity
taste
of
different
berries
mixed
with
rye
and
the
alcohol
taste
and
carbonation
gives
it
a
sweet
wine
like
feel
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
clings
to
the
lips
and
tastebuds
and
if
you
like
a
strong
sweet
fruity
beer
than
this
is
a
beer
for
you
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
when
ever
i
feel
like
having
a
fruity
beer
in
the
future
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
now
all
i
need
to
do
is
try
shorts
uber
goober
and
pb
and
j
beers
d
this
is
quite
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
is
pretty
different
from
the
beer
that
i
usually
drink
this
isa
very
interesting
beer
and
if
i
was
in
the
right
mood
i
would
get
this
one
again
d
this
actually
grew
on
me
slightly
still
pretty
ugly
to
look
at
like
a
lot
of
shorts
brews
and
comes
off
as
trying
just
a
bit
too
hard
again
shorts
not
completely
bad
and
a
good
change
of
pace
through
most
standard
beers
d
the
abv
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
it
delivers
as
a
fruit
beer
should
a
little
girlier
maybe
but
the
abv
isnt
its
easy
to
lay
down
a
sixer
of
these
without
trying
i
dont
know
if
thats
a
good
thing
yet
or
not
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
nice
balance
between
fruit
hops
and
malts
its
high
gravity
but
not
boozy
very
drinkable
dessert
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
session
this
as
it
starts
to
taste
like
a
wine
cooler
after
about
34
the
way
through
the
bottle
overall
this
is
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
commit
to
a
full
six
pack
if
i
can
find
more
singles
of
this
i
would
pick
it
up
every
now
and
then
d
one
and
done
for
me
but
it
was
enjoyable
perfect
beer
for
your
winewine
cooler
drinking
wife
personally
i
will
pass
overall
simply
wonderful
and
something
i
would
have
no
issues
with
going
after
again
another
winner
from
shorts
decent
but
i
doubt
id
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
plus
shorts
is
difficult
to
find
in
my
area
ill
give
it
some
brownie
points
for
being
high
abv
but
easy
to
drink
if
i
had
it
fresh
on
tap
id
definitely
try
it
pours
a
beautiful
pink
ruby
with
a
nice
lightlytinted
head
that
has
a
bit
of
a
reddish
character
nose
is
soft
fruits
with
quite
a
few
different
berries
the
strawberry
really
came
through
to
me
with
the
blueberry
coming
through
to
a
lesser
extent
nice
blueberry
and
strawberry
flavor
throughout
in
the
end
the
feel
was
pretty
decent
and
it
drank
well
enough
but
the
unique
concept
only
lasted
for
a
bit
before
this
started
to
taste
less
interesting
and
wasnt
much
to
keep
me
drinking
picked
this
one
up
in
a
recent
trade
and
split
it
with
my
wife
tonight
poured
a
very
murky
purplishbrown
color
with
a
big
offwhite
head
that
is
shot
through
with
pink
and
purple
swirls
tart
berries
on
the
nose
along
with
a
hint
of
orange
juice
on
the
palate
this
one
is
mediumbodied
moderately
carbonated
lightly
tart
with
some
fruit
flavor
though
mostly
citrus
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
ill
try
to
find
again
d
i
like
it
and
i
could
drink
another
i
do
think
i
would
buy
6
another
thieved
bottle
from
my
brother
good
man
he
it
pours
a
clear
pinkishred
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mixed
berries
all
sorts
of
em
baby
with
a
minor
undertow
of
medicine
the
taste
brings
back
the
berry
bushels
dragging
along
some
flowers
cobwebs
and
a
light
rubber
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
relatively
dry
finish
overall
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
brew
all
that
much
it
sounded
pretty
tasty
but
it
seems
it
was
executed
a
bit
poorly
tasted
from
bottle
pours
pink
orange
with
a
thick
pinkish
head
that
leaves
solid
lace
the
nose
is
super
fruity
with
strawberry
dominating
and
a
toasty
malt
backbone
that
is
just
underlying
the
flavor
is
more
blueberry
dominant
with
the
toastiness
a
little
more
pronounced
the
body
is
light
with
heavy
carbonation
and
a
medium
fruity
finish
d
the
mixed
berries
are
huge
in
this
and
it
could
get
tiring
after
a
while
with
the
big
sweet
and
sour
thing
going
on
also
a
pretty
big
beer
at
7
2
or
is
it
9
bottle
pours
a
very
strawberry
red
color
with
a
slight
ligtly
pink
head
the
aroma
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
thought
with
some
strawberry
but
also
some
sort
of
offputting
aroma
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
hmm
the
taste
is
well
kind
of
blah
some
strawberry
pretty
muted
fruit
flavors
light
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
when
you
drink
it
almost
has
a
malt
liquor
taste
like
zima
to
it
this
one
is
not
a
winner
for
me
and
i
really
like
shorts
maybe
needs
to
be
fresh
from
the
tap
to
really
get
the
full
effect
pours
a
hazy
pinkish
to
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
in
the
aroma
dry
fresh
berries
in
the
taste
dry
berries
not
sugary
of
sweet
fruit
at
all
more
ale
like
a
smooth
and
light
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
berry
aftertaste
not
sugary
not
fruity
girl
like
either
shorts
must
have
made
their
reputation
on
the
rest
of
their
lineup
because
soft
parade
is
not
good
beer
this
is
one
parade
that
im
not
interested
in
joining
watching
or
drinking
d
not
sure
if
i
want
to
try
this
again
it
wasnt
a
bad
bottle
just
a
bit
strange
but
not
in
a
good
way
pinkish
red
color
with
a
large
pink
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
looks
very
good
for
a
fruit
beer
i
smell
mostly
blueberries
and
strawberries
i
also
detect
some
yeast
of
the
belgian
variety
a
nice
aroma
but
not
overly
strong
and
easy
to
pick
out
the
various
qualities
i
get
a
lot
more
malt
and
yeast
in
the
flavor
the
berries
are
still
there
but
it
is
more
in
the
finish
strawberries
being
the
berry
i
mostly
taste
something
about
fruit
beer
mouthfeel
that
i
find
unappealing
it
sort
of
disappears
from
the
mouth
leaving
a
strawberry
aftertaste
not
a
beer
i
would
want
more
than
a
12oz
bottle
in
a
day
but
it
has
good
flavor
and
overall
a
better
than
average
fruit
beer
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
it
was
okay
notes
really
different
never
had
a
beer
of
this
fashion
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
too
but
i
liked
it
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
as
if
all
this
isnt
enough
to
indicate
so
soft
parade
is
easy
to
lay
down
and
id
take
a
session
any
day
just
not
every
day
i
cant
wait
to
pour
this
in
front
of
friends
and
hide
my
smirk
as
they
remark
about
the
color
before
fully
experiencing
it
a
proud
example
of
its
breed
drinkability
gets
better
as
you
get
accustomed
to
the
way
the
yeast
and
fruit
work
together
though
it
never
works
for
me
relatively
different
but
not
one
i
will
be
heading
back
to
very
often
m
i
wish
this
were
more
carbonated
to
help
with
a
crisp
biting
feel
instead
the
carbonation
is
fluffy
and
light
dthe
carbonation
level
is
pretty
appropriate
for
this
beer
if
i
were
to
change
anything
it
would
probably
be
to
leave
out
the
blackberries
as
i
feel
they
contribute
heavily
to
the
lingering
aftertaste
i
experience
which
im
not
a
fan
of
as
far
as
fruity
beers
go
this
is
a
cut
above
the
rest
it
is
much
more
beer
than
fruit
sure
id
drink
this
again
it
just
might
not
be
the
first
fruit
beer
that
id
grab
i
like
my
fruit
beers
to
be
prominently
fruitforward
pours
a
hazy
translucent
really
reddish
mahogany
quite
appealing
to
the
eye
malty
aroma
has
a
strong
overtone
of
berries
especially
raspberries
raspberry
dominates
the
flavor
which
includes
hints
of
blueberry
and
strawberry
as
well
as
malt
and
hoppy
bitterness
jazzy
tingly
fizzy
texture
leaves
a
lively
finish
d
this
brew
is
actually
pretty
damn
good
considering
its
a
fruit
beer
it
drank
well
and
was
more
complex
than
expected
ive
had
this
in
my
fridge
basically
since
the
day
i
got
it
so
whatever
happened
happened
before
it
got
to
me
but
this
beer
was
literally
undrinkable
ive
had
very
few
drain
pours
in
my
life
this
was
unequivocally
one
of
them
d
this
was
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
really
was
hoping
for
something
more
exciting
and
interesting
but
was
left
disappointed
d
from
the
description
on
the
bottle
i
wouldve
expected
a
bit
more
complexity
and
honestly
a
bit
more
flavor
overall
the
substance
is
there
but
is
completely
watered
down
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
but
really
not
my
mug
of
beer
please
be
advised
as
with
all
my
reviews
this
one
is
imho
i
do
not
have
nor
claim
to
have
training
in
reviewing
beers
i
am
a
simple
guy
who
likes
beer
if
i
do
not
like
a
style
of
beer
i
will
not
review
it
although
i
do
keep
the
style
guidelines
in
mind
all
my
reviews
are
simple
and
short
i
tell
you
imho
what
i
think
of
the
beer
and
how
i
feel
it
tastes
for
that
style
medium
body
for
a
fruit
beer
good
carbonation
this
is
very
easy
drinking
the
wife
liked
it
as
did
the
3
guys
that
sampled
some
maybe
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
certainly
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
fruit
beers
or
red
wines
like
malbecs
d
goes
down
quite
easily
somewhat
filling
7
2
abv
gives
it
a
good
kick
with
out
any
discernable
alcohol
flavoring
i
could
have
a
pint
or
two
of
this
again
pours
pinkish
brown
with
a
one
finger
lightly
pink
hued
head
smells
like
the
berry
medley
that
is
promised
on
the
label
with
some
breadiness
taste
is
all
the
berries
from
the
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
some
very
light
tartness
in
the
finish
i
get
breadiness
but
not
necessarily
rye
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thin
highly
carbonated
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
a
self
describe
high
gravity
ale
overall
a
very
good
fruit
beer
the
sort
of
strong
effort
ive
come
to
expect
from
shorts
poured
from
a
growler
into
a
pint
glass
sweet
fruity
strawberry
aroma
one
finger
head
murky
brown
with
red
hues
taste
starts
with
a
little
bit
of
the
fruit
followed
by
notes
from
the
malt
bill
finishes
with
a
medium
bitterness
well
carbonated
slippery
mouthfeel
overall
it
is
a
unique
tasting
fruit
beer
although
there
is
some
alcohol
in
the
flavor
profile
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
being
9
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
and
wellcrafted
fruit
beers
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
slick
there
is
also
a
pretty
high
level
of
carbonation
the
one
really
nice
thing
is
there
is
no
sign
of
the
abv
at
all
and
it
drinks
quite
well
even
though
i
particularly
didnt
enjoy
the
taste
i
has
no
apprehension
finishing
the
bottle
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
before
but
its
generally
been
enjoyed
near
the
end
of
a
hard
night
of
consumption
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
it
from
a
bottle
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
the
average
beer
drinker
its
not
a
crowd
pleaser
by
any
means
however
if
you
dont
mind
lambics
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
sipper
but
refreshing
and
fun
light
hearted
sweet
carbonated
and
easy
a
pretty
unique
beer
that
is
worth
checking
out
for
sure
worth
drinking
and
enjoying
the
rest
of
the
6pack
may
not
buy
it
again
though
d
for
the
summer
or
anytime
for
that
matter
a
must
buy
throughout
the
season
for
a
fruit
and
vegetable
beer
i
find
it
one
of
the
more
quaffable
ones
i
usually
steer
clear
from
these
types
of
beers
just
not
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
however
this
one
has
the
right
elements
for
good
drinkability
nice
brew
from
shorts
d
a
rather
unexciting
beer
that
became
almost
annoying
to
drink
the
wife
refused
to
even
taste
it
i
disliked
every
moment
of
drinking
this
one
never
again
no
way
d
yuck
more
like
drinking
juice
seems
like
a
beer
made
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
cant
do
any
more
of
this
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
it
kind
of
screws
with
my
head
because
it
initially
tastes
pretty
bad
but
leaves
a
quite
refreshing
after
taste
too
bad
this
one
just
doesnt
come
together
tasteberry
fruits
wheat
subtle
flavors
nicely
balanced
very
refreshing
an
excellent
warm
weather
brew
a
fine
balance
keeps
this
beer
in
line
what
could
have
been
a
cloying
mess
is
instead
easy
on
the
palate
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
with
the
alchohol
wellhidden
in
a
tangy
and
tasty
offering
for
the
hot
summer
months
dnot
really
my
bag
a
mess
of
fruit
and
no
malt
to
back
it
up
i
might
like
this
better
if
they
had
thrown
some
bugs
into
it
and
soured
the
beer
maybe
next
time
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
hit
with
the
bugs
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
being
the
little
sister
to
the
imperial
version
doesnt
leave
the
same
impression
ive
heard
good
things
about
shorts
and
some
of
their
offerings
i
dont
think
this
was
one
of
them
very
unbalanced
and
overly
fruity
i
would
say
that
i
wont
drink
this
again
but
i
have
five
more
bottles
to
go
through
overall
pretty
disappointing
the
taste
is
and
aroma
are
bland
and
boring
barely
any
fruit
in
here
at
all
dont
bother
drinking
this
very
unconventional
and
satisfying
its
60f
sunny
and
breezy
outside
and
this
offering
is
doing
me
just
fine
i
love
the
slight
sourness
of
this
ale
along
with
the
bitter
chalky
hop
profile
it
really
mixes
well
with
the
fresh
fruit
giving
lots
of
balance
and
dimension
i
believe
ill
make
room
in
my
fridge
for
this
ale
for
the
spring
summer
months
strong
and
decent
for
a
fruit
ale
great
fro
mixing
with
stouts
d
refreshing
not
light
by
any
stretch
the
ale
packs
a
bunch
of
fruit
into
a
small
package
its
no
strawberry
shorts
cake
but
id
take
another
bottle
d
would
like
more
of
the
fruit
flavors
i
dont
know
if
this
is
an
older
bottle
but
it
would
seem
given
the
amount
of
fruit
that
is
in
it
it
would
come
out
more
overall
a
great
beer
to
sniff
not
so
much
when
you
take
a
sip
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
o
easily
blows
the
bottled
variety
of
this
beer
out
of
the
water
and
then
some
all
shorts
is
better
ontap
no
question
about
this
the
palate
isnt
as
awful
as
the
nose
but
that
isnt
saying
much
harsh
solvents
alcohol
and
cooked
fruit
before
a
grassy
and
vegetal
finish
and
if
that
isnt
enough
theres
some
rubber
in
the
middle
light
in
body
with
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
the
awful
finish
just
reemphasizes
the
trainwreck
that
this
beer
is
d
the
taste
kills
this
beer
for
me
along
with
the
extremely
high
carbonation
from
the
3
or
4
beers
i
have
had
from
shorts
they
seem
like
an
amazing
brewery
and
very
innovative
this
beer
however
was
my
least
favorite
to
date
from
shorts
beer
is
mostly
tart
i
dont
know
the
point
of
this
beer
unfortunately
its
about
1
flavor
and
its
not
that
strong
a
flavor
i
guess
there
is
some
nontart
sourness
in
there
as
well
i
just
dont
care
enough
to
talk
about
it
mouthfeel
is
ok
drinkability
is
boring
overall
im
just
really
bored
interesting
peachbronzereddish
colored
body
and
a
large
pinkwhite
head
sticks
around
like
ocean
foam
smell
is
somewhat
bizarre
kind
of
funky
tart
and
sweet
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
it
almost
smells
like
spoiled
fruit
and
industrial
chemicals
i
dont
think
i
care
for
it
too
much
yet
it
doesnt
absolutely
suck
either
the
taste
is
mouthpuckering
tart
and
sour
fruity
and
my
burps
taste
like
a
bouquet
of
flowers
a
bitter
blanket
coats
my
tounge
texture
and
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
decent
but
i
really
do
not
want
another
one
of
these
beers
the
aftertaste
is
killing
me
it
tastes
like
i
just
drank
some
perfume
drinkability
for
a
fruit
beer
extremely
so
i
honestly
think
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
session
these
and
at
7
abv
which
is
hidden
quite
well
you
would
be
having
a
good
time
after
a
couple
i
really
wish
i
had
waited
to
have
this
when
my
fiancée
was
home
because
she
would
probably
really
enjoy
this
and
she
normally
hates
beer
if
i
ever
come
across
a
six
pack
of
this
when
back
home
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
one
up
for
the
hell
of
it
because
it
is
definitely
something
i
would
try
again
when
in
the
mood
for
something
light
but
potent
easily
drinkable
i
could
certainly
go
for
more
good
balance
of
flavors
overall
but
could
use
just
a
little
hop
presence
taste
reveals
more
of
a
blend
of
the
fruit
with
maltsgrains
than
expected
from
the
allfruit
smell
the
sweetness
of
the
berries
is
very
juicy
and
slightly
tart
and
it
is
tempered
by
a
bit
of
dry
crispy
graininess
from
the
rye
the
alcohol
is
present
but
id
describe
it
as
more
smooth
than
hot
the
feel
is
very
lightly
carbonated
almost
a
little
on
the
flat
side
and
juicy
and
refreshing
highly
drinkable
d
drinks
pretty
easy
and
doesnt
seem
like
7
d
this
beer
started
out
well
but
fell
short
in
just
how
overthetop
the
yeast
carbonation
are
other
than
that
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
the
unfiltered
ale
poured
to
a
light
pink
haze
2inch
pinkish
head
formed
but
settled
rapidly
belgian
lace
did
not
form
nice
berry
nose
and
palate
with
some
bitter
and
greenleaf
edges
mediumlight
body
with
attenuated
lingering
hints
of
sweetness
balanced
against
the
bitter
notes
the
fruit
notes
are
most
evident
and
intriguing
when
served
at
cellar
temperatures
rather
than
refrigerated
although
promoted
as
brewed
special
for
those
ladies
who
enjoy
their
wine
that
is
far
too
limiting
this
brew
is
appropriate
for
both
genders
winedrinker
or
not
d
for
me
the
beer
is
too
sweet
not
to
say
that
someone
may
like
it
just
not
me
decent
enough
not
a
big
fruit
beer
lover
but
this
seemed
well
done
the
carbonation
is
pleasantly
sharp
in
the
mouth
but
it
does
leave
a
little
bit
of
stickiness
behind
while
its
not
very
high
in
alcohol
nor
does
it
feel
heavy
its
still
more
of
a
sipping
beer
for
me
its
probably
nice
for
a
summers
day
and
i
enjoyed
having
it
but
its
nothing
i
need
to
have
too
often
if
ever
again
overall
a
very
good
take
on
fruit
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
solid
and
interesting
offering
by
shorts
d
meh
fruit
beers
are
not
my
favorite
to
begin
with
and
this
did
nothing
to
change
my
mind
on
that
account
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
one
i
could
see
a
lot
of
nonbeer
lovers
really
liking
i
could
use
a
little
more
tartness
to
add
a
some
more
depth
to
the
sweetness
but
not
bad
at
all
for
a
nonsour
fruit
beer
flavor
just
like
i
thought
it
would
very
sweet
and
fruity
honestly
it
tastes
like
a
wine
cooler
just
like
it
smelled
reminds
me
of
a
dirtyhoeframboise
lambic
with
hoegarden
a
little
carbonated
but
overall
very
easy
to
drink
overall
im
surprised
this
is
considered
a
beer
but
tasty
overall
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
a
high
abv
fruit
beer
sounded
like
a
winner
but
it
was
just
a
mess
once
i
tasted
it
too
much
going
on
that
the
flavors
mix
together
in
a
way
that
i
didnt
prefer
for
the
abv
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
however
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
once
you
can
get
past
the
really
strange
smell
its
a
very
refreshing
beer
but
the
taste
doesnt
have
the
fruit
presence
that
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
pours
pink
not
red
pink
like
similar
to
white
zinfandel
almost
no
head
at
alla
dn
it
dissapears
right
away
smell
is
yeast
and
strawberries
and
is
more
than
slightly
unpleasant
the
taste
is
heavily
of
strawberries
with
a
sour
aftertaste
the
smell
make
stasting
rough
and
im
trying
to
decide
if
i
want
to
finish
the
beer
or
drain
pour
it
and
go
on
to
something
better
the
only
other
similar
beers
ive
had
are
founders
cerise
new
glarus
belgian
red
and
rasberry
tart
this
is
definitely
not
any
of
those
md
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
about
spot
on
for
a
fruit
beer
but
it
had
average
drinkability
for
as
sweet
of
a
style
drinkability
normally
i
dont
go
for
the
fruity
beers
the
ones
that
ive
had
usually
taste
artificial
and
overly
sweet
to
me
this
brew
is
very
refreshingly
sweet
but
not
over
done
this
one
is
surprisingly
good
thanks
kevin
my

it

3

to
finally
get
it
in

fairly
standard
copper

nice
and
bright

lingering

a
blend
of

pretty
much
dominates
slight

tang
sweetness
is
a
bit
subdued
considering
the
fruit
flavor
finish
is
rather
dry
ok
enough
body
not
overly
impressed
in
general
an
ok
beer
maybe
fresher
would
be
better
pretty
decent
brew
but
i
cant
imagine
folks
would
want
this
on
a
regular
basis
a
novelty
a
flashback
to
the
80s
bj
but
not
something
to
reach
for
more
than
once
in
a
blue
moon
d
good
drinkability
for
a
beer
with
such
a
high
abv
4
0
fairly
drinkable
but
the
astringent
kind
of
kills
the
desire
for
much
more
id
like
to
try
the
imperial
series
version
meh
its
hard
for
me
to
hate
on
a
shorts
brew
but
this
beer
just
wasnt
good
to
me
very
carbonated
up
front
way
too
much
so
possibly
from
slight
oxidization
there
is
still
some
kind
of
funky
earthiness
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
rye
in
there
balancing
out
the
natural
sweetness
of
the
fruit
again
raspberries
are
prominent
with
a
hood
bit
of
blackberry
blueberry
and
faint
strawberry
again
its
nice
that
it
tastes
like
fruit
not
fruit
flavor
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
but
i
still
didnt
find
it
too
drinkable
this
is
an
interesting
brew
but
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
raspberries
so
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
interesting
and
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
put
too
much
effort
in
seeking
it
out
i
admire
the
craft
behind
this
and
im
a
lover
in
tart
fruit
beers
but
this
may
be
too
much
drinkability
one
is
enough
i
think
d
not
bad
for
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
normal
for
the
style
drinkability
is
high
mainly
because
i
keep
reaching
for
the
glass
hoping
that
each
passing
moment
opens
up
the
flavor
more
but
it
never
happens
as
it
stands
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
far
too
light
for
7
2
abv
another
winner
from
joe
and
the
crew
at
shorts
i
just
wish
i
wasnt
so
far
away
from
the
brewery
i
wouldnt
mind
soft
parade
being
a
little
sweeter
but
then
again
i
have
a
notorious
sweet
tooth
my
friend
who
i
was
drinking
soft
parade
with
mentioned
the
liked
it
because
it
wasnt
too
sweet
so
obviously
its
a
personal
preference
either
way
its
one
hell
of
a
tasty
beer
d
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
goes
down
incredibly
easily
for
7
alcohol
would
definitely
buy
again
if
i
needed
a
change
of
pace
drinkability
eh
a
sampler
is
sufficient
overall
a
really
good
fruit
rye
ale
from
an
even
more
outstanding
brewery
ive
yet
to
drink
something
from
shorts
i
havent
enjoyed
very
drinkable
but
very
fruity
maybe
too
much
a
pretty
interesting
fruit
beer
definitely
worth
trying
d
for
the
abv
and
style
this
is
rather
enjoyable
overall
a
little
girly
but
a
great
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
fruity
beer
d
didnt
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
one
we
were
quite
surprised
by
its
fresh
berry
characteristics
and
its
ease
of
drinkability
excellent
summer
beer
astringent
tartness
raspberry
medicinal
bitterness
in
the
back
with
a
malty
aftertaste
fruit
is
indistinct
and
muddled
save
for
the
raspberry
its
like
trying
to
identify
the
specific
fruit
in
hawaiian
punch
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
amount
of
body
the
abv
is
certainly
hidden

a
bad

for
a

in

with
a

for
the

but
letting
it
sit
a

brings
out
the
nice

very

with
just
enough

to
balance
things
out

wouldnt

it

is
topnotch
taste
unsurprisingly
the
berries
are
taking
center
stage
i
cant
discern
the
multiple
berry
flavors
the
way
i
could
the
smells
finishes
with
a
tart
bitterness
would
love
to
see
the
brewers
at
shorts
make
a
sour
parade
specialty
batch
with
brett
or
something
else
equally
as
funky
d
one
of
the
stranger
beers
ive
had
recently
i
normally
dont
get
into
fruited
beers
but
this
is
among
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
though
jordan
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
as
opposed
to
the
imperial
soft
parade
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
berry
aroma
reddish
brown
and
lacey
strawberry
taste
mainly
more
subtle
than
bold
but
above
average
fruit
beer
carbonation
appropriate
but
above
average
drinkable
but
not
something
i
need
to
seek
out
drinkability
is
excellent
abvs
are
hidden
ridiculously
well
very
crisp
and
refreshing
to
drink
very
few
brews
at
this
abv
will
go
down
this
smoothly
remarkably
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
clear
reddish
orange
fruit
juice
looking
medium
sized
white
head
forms
drops
to
a
thick
lace
ring
some
chunks
stick
to
the
glass
looks
good
smell
is
neat
fresh
fruit
salad
berries
strawberries
bit
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
biscuit
more
berries
cherries
a
bit
earthy
very
fresh
smelling
pretty
cool
taste
is
similar
tons
of
fruit
very
juicy
berries
some
wheat
and
biscuit
strawberies
sugary
fruit
juice
middle
mango
again
pretty
neat
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
abv
is
very
hidden
and
the
fresh
fruit
character
is
great
but
dont
think
i
would
want
a
full
pint
of
this
one
drinkability
is
nice
pretty
well
balanced
but
the
above
average
carbonation
and
the
sweetness
slow
you
down
a
bit
still
a
nice
complex
fruit
character
that
im
enjoying
d
mmmm
i
sure
am
glad
were
getting
two
more
bottles
of
this
when
deuane
returns
from
his
trip
to
mi
this
is
a
unique
and
outstanding
beer
from
shorts
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
thanks
to
the
wife
for
sharing
this
with
me
strong
carbonation
that
makes
the
beer
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
if
you
like
sweetass
fruits
is
excellent
of
course
if
i
was
in
a
fruity
mood
id
throw
down
several
easily
i
had
this
before
my
dinner
and
it
made
a
very
nice
appetizer
course
very
interesting
imperial
style
fruit
beer
from
shorts
lots
of
fresh
berry
flavors
going
on
in
this
and
the
rye
character
added
a
different
layer
of
complexity
to
it
plus
it
definitely
earned
its
name
with
that
mouthfeel
remaining
soft
and
easy
despite
the
alcohol
presence
in
this
well
done
dwithout
question
a
most
impressive
complex
fruit
combination
a
very
interesting
and
flavourful
brew
pours
a
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappears
huge
smell
of
strawberry
and
other
fruit
flavors
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
and
is
very
different
from
the
smell
tastes
of
rye
with
a
fruity
sweetness
and
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
has
medium
body
and
has
decent
carbination
drinkability
is
good
and
is
hindered
only
by
its
high
abv
the
board
at
the
brewery
said
8
0
overall
a
solid
choice
from
shorts
for
those
who
enjoy
fruit
beers
d
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
one
the
fruit
tasted
fresh
and
did
not
hide
the
fact
that
this
was
beer
the
only
fruit
that
i
did
not
notice
that
was
used
in
this
beer
was
the
blueberry
which
to
me
says
a
lot
about
the
expressiveness
of
the
fruit
in
this
beer
the
use
of
rye
not
only
helped
balence
the
beer
but
also
added
a
nice
level
of
complexity
not
always
found
in
fruit
beers
a
great
extreme
beer
in
every
possible
sense
of
the
word
wow
no
one
could
convince
me
that
this
was
9
abv
this
is
just
hidden
so
well
and
its
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
ever
had
not
to
mention
being
extremely
interesting
thanks
again
brendan
another
great
shorts
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
ashleys
in
ann
arbor
i
was
happy
to
see
a
shorts
beer
on
tap
but
was
not
prepared
for
it
to
be
a
fruit
beer
the
beer
was
slightly
hazed
reddish
orange
colored
with
a
laceable
head
the
aroma
was
very
berry
i
couldnt
tell
which
berry
varieties
but
i
would
guess
raspberry
there
was
a
pleasant
aftertaste
a
little
yeasty
as
well
as
sweet
and
berryish
easy
drinking
if
not
a
little
too
sweet
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
it
were
but
not
a
bad
accomplishment
either
this
is
probably
a
good
beer
to
share
with
ladies
who
prefer
fruity
beers
but
find
lambics
too
fruity
the
color
of
this
beer
a
dark
pink
color
initially
scared
me
thinking
that
it
would
be
an
over
the
top
fruity
beer
in
reality
it
was
surprisingly
balanced
on
the
fruit
there
was
not
an
overly
sweet
taste
but
rather
a
dry
finish
a
little
like
champagne
i
could
not
pick
out
the
specific
fruit
although
i
know
it
has
strawberries
blackberries
blueberries
and
raspberries
it
is
a
kicker
at
78
they
have
an
imperial
at
10
hence
the
nickname
ye
olde
leg
spreader
it
was
not
one
that
i
would
drink
too
much
off
although
it
is
good
it
is
very
powerful
and
i
like
too
many
of
the
other
beers
to
pass
out
that
quickly
sampled
on
draught

torani
only
wishes
their
shit
was
this
potent
and
accurate
in
its

flavor
well
almost
surprisingly
this
isnt
really
cloying
or
sickly

by
a
dry

the
finish

fruit
barleywine
this
damn
drinkable
methinks
so
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
great
taste
crisp
and
refreshing
o
this
is
like
a
hard
cider
and
a
beer
combined
very
weird
in
character
but
that
has
been
the
whole
story
with
this
beer
this
doesnt
particularly
dive
into
my
realm
but
i
would
have
this
over
redds
apple
ale
i
find
the
fruitiness
of
this
to
be
overwhelming
the
taste
in
itself
isnt
bad
but
its
overpowering
not
much
on
the
nose
no
fruity
tones
in
the
taste
feel
is
very
watered
down
this
beer
tastes
and
smells
like
cough
syrup
to
me
i
have
tried
it
several
times
attempting
to
give
it
another
chance
but
i
cant
stomach
it
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
tastes
good
looks
good
and
goes
down
smooth
good
fruit
notes
great
beer
for
the
cost
o
notquiteevenclose
to
a
pale
ale
no
hops
not
much
real
beer
flavor
and
definitely
not
pale
in
color
pretty
simple
but
thats
its
strong
point
a
good
refreshing
summery
beer
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
bought
a
six
opened
one
took
two
drinks
discarded
the
rest
ok
many
years
ago
still
ok
now
just
have
not
been
happy
with
anything
they
put
out
its
sad
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
still
very
smooth
tasting
beer
will
certainly
add
into
the
collection
to
have
in
the
beer
fridge
great
tasting
beer
has
a
very
unique
taste
golden
orange
in
color
with
perfect

frothy

with

sweet

are

no

are

and

with

smooth
and
creamy
through
the
middle
with
a
slow
building
drying
sensation
toward
the
end
sweet
mellow
apricot
and

up

balanced
by
moderate
bitterness
through
the
middle
no

light
bready

near
the
end
as
this
finished
clean
crisp
and
dry
with
a
light
ready
and
bitter
aftertaste
fruit
malt
and
bitterness
strike
are
very
well
balanced
exemplifies
the
style
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
here
if
to
be
different
they
succeeded
but
not
in
a
good
way
tastes
more
like
a
chemical
laced
soft
drink
than
a
beer
i
have
had
worse
beers
but
not
many
a
fruit
beer
and
though
not
to
my
taste
fine
for
what
it
is
good
beer
real
smooth
flavor
i
liked
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
good
overall
taste
its
like
a
pale
ale
with
an
attempt
at
fruity
that
doesnt
really
come
through
lemony
with
some
mild
beer
flavor
not
my
type
of
beer
does
not
meet
the
tastes
l9ike
beer
test
but
not
awful
if
you
like
a
lighter
lemony
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
beer
flavor
peach
tangerine
up
front
with
boring
malt
profile
not
enjoyable
overall
meh
underwhelming
nothing
at
all
stands
out
i
dont
even
know
if
i
would
recommend
it
even
in
a
mix
and
match
not
enough
grains
to
make
the
body
equal
the
amount
of
fruit
added
and
not
enough
hops
either
its
just
to
unbalanced
that
makes
it
not
that
great
ill
have
a
bud
please
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
i
really
enjoy
how
refreshing
it
is
with
the
nicely
balanced
malt
raspberry
and
belgian
yeast
very
good
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
drinkable
but
less
than
memorable
it
definitely
asked
more
questions
than
it
answered
it
has
a
good
fruit
taste
to
it
but
overall
it
still
ends
up
being
smooth
with
not
too
much
bitterness
or
sour
taste
to
it
an
okay
beer
but
kinda
weird
across
the
board
seems
like
they
tried
to
make
something
that
would
appeal
to
people
who
dont
really
want
flavorful
beer
maybe
they
succeeded
but
thats
not
what
i
want
this
beer
is
underrated
sweet
taste
full
feel
so
drinkable
my
only
qualm
is
the
slight
syrupy
sugary
feel
that
forms
on
the
back
of
my
palate
over
time
good
with
anything
so
even
tho
some
wouldnt
call
it
world
class
its
really
good
any
time
and
stacks
up
against
the
best
f
yes
really
distinguished
apricot
tones

of
magic
hats

overall
its
ok
but
doesnt

to
others
ok
but
did
not
care
so
much
for
the
funky
aftertatse
which
lingered
o
very
easy
drinking
but
likely
becasue
there
isnt
much
to
this
beer
in
the
way
of
dominant
flavors
or
complexity
it
tastes
mass
produced
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
was
definitely
worth
trying
once
i
dont
think
i
will
be
getting
again
any
time
soon
though
smooth
and
drinkable
no
after
taste
and
i
could
not
taste
any
vegetables
enjoy
this
tastes
like
cough
syrup
cant
shake
it
i
made
it
through
one
the
other
night
i
tried
a
second
tonight
and
couldnt
stomach
it
i
recycled
the
remaining
four
bottles
tastes
like
an
expired
miller
highlife
so
gross
overall
not
a
terrible
fruit
beer
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
a
lot
of
the
other
ones
on
the
market
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
apricots
and
more
beer
like
than
others
in
the
style
but
not
my
preference
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
this
was
the
first
beer
ive
drank
that
i
would
classify
as
refreshing
id
had
other
magic
hat
brews
and
brought
to
a
bbq
and
everyone
made
the
same
face
when
they
noticed
how
smooth
and
fresh
the
beer
was
after
a
first
sip
pairs
extremely
well
with
food
and
is
and
ideal
summer
beer
f
yall
snobs
this
ones
for
you
barb
youre
my
boy
blue
it
wasnt
bad
and
id
get
it
again
definitely
is
worth
serving

than
the
crazy
cold
way
we
tend
to
serve
beer
here
in
the
states

kind

wouldnt
buy

id
get
it

bar
again

not

unique

poured
a

with

fairly
boring
looking
beer
scents
of
sweet
raspberry

overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
very

beer
no
other
aromas
are

very
sweet
and
fitting
a
fruit
beer
but
a
bit
lacking
in

sour

not

quickly
giving

to

overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
very
fruity
beer
that
is
balanced
mostly
towards
berry
flavors
with
malt
most
apparent
on
the
aftertaste
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
nose
let
on
however
and
is
pleasantly
dry
on
the
finish
better
than
expected
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
an
effervescent
slightly
chalky
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
very
drinkable
light
beer
refreshing
and
crisp
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
fruit
beer
it
has
a
rather
pleasant
sweet
aroma
leading
into
a
nicely
sweet
beginning
flavor
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
aided
by
a
crisp
mouthfeel
it
is
refreshing
not
at
all
cloying
and
fairly
well
done
a
fruity
beer
with
attractive
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
in
a
social
setting
definitely
not
for
th
e
superhoppy
lippuckering
beer
drinker
goes
great
with
bar
food
pretzels
with
mustard
wings
nacos
etc
o
somewhat
unique
but
flavor
left
halfway
through
no
distinguishing
flavor
to
write
about
i
was
surprised
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
was
good
i
would
definitely
order
it
if
they
had
it
at
a
restaurant
think
i
will
buy
a
12
too
it
is
different
no
real
flavors
but
not
watery
not
bitter
like
many
beers
can
be
i
was
told
this
had
a
unique
flavor
i
wasnt
lied
too
from
what
i
tastes
which
im
not
sure
what
i
do
taste
i
feel
as
if
there
is
some
vegtables
used
in
the
brewing
process
i
gain
a
hint
a
tartness
that
is
paired
well
with
a
mild
sweetness
for
any
of
cooks
out
there
i
do
reccomend
using
this
to
marinade
chicken
with
had
it
on
tap
and
thought
it
was
quite
pleasant
not
sure
why
it
is
rated
so
low
here
i
was
sampling
beers
you
know
a
super
market
cares
when
you
can
put
together
a
six
pack
before
i
tried
this
i
was
drinking
a
favorite
ipa
coronado
idiot
ipa
so
this
was
a
step
down
it
is
interesting
i
had
two
look
this
beer
up
because
i
thought
i
tasted
peaches
i
see
it
might
be
made
with
apricots
interesting
not
for
a
purist
though
not
a
session
beer
i
would
try
it
again
on
tap
not
bad
light
bodied
crisp
and
drinkable
are
points
in
its
favor
decent
nothing
amazing
but
decent
on
tap
had
a
bottle
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
after
it
had
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
few
weeks
the
beer
had
some
mild
hop
flavor
and
was
ok
but
there
was
not
much
that
was
special
about
it
low
abv
is
sometimes
desirable
drinkability
light
enough
that
several
can
be
drank
its
a
gooddrink
several
and
dont
look
cheap
type
beer
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
this
is
is
it
a
wheat
beer
it
is
not
an
ipa
sometimes
a
can
of
this
in
the
summer
is
really
quite
nice
and
if
im
somewhere
backstage
and
there
are
free
beers
ill
probably
pick
this
over
the
other
options
but
other
than
that
i
just
dont
really
enjoy
this
any
more
drinkability
drinkable
but
must
be
cold
or
its
rough
on
the
palate
the
fruitiness
draws
you
in
and
the
little
ditties
they
write
under
the
cap
keep
you
from
drinking
all
of
it
at
3
in
the
afternoon
on
a
monday
you
know
just
cuz
excellent
beer
just
starting
on
beer
thought
it
was
ok
magic
hats
flagship
beer
and
with
good
reason
tastes
like
american
beer
used
too
full
bodied
and
well
balanced
not
overly
hopped
not
too
weak
not
too
strong
just
right
first
time
i
tries
this
beer
it
was
in
college
8
years
ago
and
didnt
care
for
it
however
as
my
taste
for
beer
has
evolved
i
feel
as
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
change
from
the
regularly
available
beers
in
the
northeast
its
okay
my
favorite
go
to
beer
nice
hint
of
apricot
but
no
unnecessary
sweetness
very
nice
mild
flavored
beer
with
a
slight
fruity
flavor
o
not
a
beer
i
would
generally
choose
but
good
nonetheless
light
notes
of
apricot
and
bready
yeast
are
followed
by
a
little
tartness
and
a
clean
finish
i
am
going
to
have
to
get
a
lot
more
practice
in
reviewing
and
learning
how
to
put
up
a
good
description
of
my
beer
experiences
haters
gonna
hate
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
underrated
on
here
because
it
has
three
characteristics
that
people
on
ba
tend
to
dislike
its
a
fruit
beer
its
mass
distributed
and
its
made
by
magic
hat
while
not
an
amazing
beer
its
certainly
better
than
average
the
point
of
rating
beers
on
ba
is
to
consider
a
beer
within
its
own
genre
and
as
far
as
fruit
beers
are
concerned
i
think
this
one
is
damn
good
if
you
dont
like
fruit
beers
it
should
be
no
surprise
to
you
that
you
wont
like
this
one
if
you
think
its
uncool
to
drink
magic
hat
either
because
its
mass
distributed
or
because
of
the
west
6th
thing
then
dont
drink
it
anyway
now
that
im
down
off
my
soapbox
the
flavor
of
this
is
rich
and
the
apricots
definitely
come
through
refreshing
pretty
much
any
time
of
year
the
color
has
an
inviting
orangish
hue
which
i
find
very
appealing
mouthfeel
isnt
awesome
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
this
has
always
been
a
favorite
since
my
college
days
whenever
i
had
enough
money
to
afford
it
love
the
sweet
fruity
smell
you
get
its
not
over
powering
though
and
its
smooth
going
down
not
a
lot
of
bit
always
a
fall
back
beer
for
me
if
nothing
else
catches
my
attention
final
grade
3
41
a
passable
b
magic
hat
9
is
a
drinkable
but
fairly
unremarkable
apricot
beer
a
substyle
that
i
will
admit
i
am
not
exactly
wellstudied
in
this
has
all
the
markings
of
a
serviceable
massmarketable
fruit
beer
which
is
probably
how
it
has
managed
to
become
so
widely
spread
even
available
in
canada
and
longlived
in
the
marketplace
at
5
and
change
for
a
4pack
its
a
bit
of
a
steal
from
my
perspective
but
its
still
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
o
i
tasted
more
tea
than
apricots
this
would
be
a
good
choice
where
you
can
build
your
own
six
pack
o
its
not
all
that
bad
a
drink
i
could
certainly
understand
it
being
popular
amongst
young
kids
who
dont
enjoy
the
flavors
of
traditional
ales
and
lagers
real
beer
o
leftover
from
a
fourth
of
july
party
so
i
cant
complain
the
rest
of
this
one
will
be
made
into
pancakes
and
the
other
beers
will
be
given
to
my
family
when
they
come
over
tomorrow
it
is
a
not
quite
pale
ale
on
the
label
but
it
is
given
as
a
fruitvegetable
beer
on
here
which
makes
this
a
weird
beer
this
beer
was
a
good
beer
from
what
i
can
remember
i
know
that
i
liked
it
it
has
just
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
it
i
know
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
one
that
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
if
i
could
find
it
somewhere
close
to
where
i
live
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
poured
into
a
glass
from
a
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
lacing
isnt
very
prevalent
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
smooth
and
the
taste
is
smooth
very
much
like
a
fruit
beer
the
smell
is
fruity
as
well
i
would
try
this
again
it
wasnt
bad
had
this
brew
at
a
bar
in
louisiana
poured
a
two
finger
head
that
left
quickly
really
sticky
lacing
poured
at
a
moderate
pace
into
a
frosted
mug
from
a
bottle
first
sniff
gives
you
not
much
a
smell
at
all
first
taste
is
not
very
please
has
a
light
feel
in
your
mouth
but
a
kind
of
a
grapey
initial
taste
but
very
bitter
after
taste
i
dont
lie
this
very
much
at
all
wont
try
it
again
dont
recommend
picked
up
a
magic
hat
mix
pack
because
i
had
not
had
any
of
their
beers
they
have
not
gotten
good
ratings
so
my
expectations
were
low
this
one
surprised
me
decent
looking
beer
that
does
not
offer
much
to
the
nose
but
tasty
nothing
special
but
a
good
enjoyable
beer
i
will
gladly
have
another
of
these
this
is
the
beer
the
put
magic
hat
on
the
map
and
for
good
reason
theyre
right
by
calling
it
a
not
quite
a
pale
ale
as
the
color
is
more
of
a
paler
amber
if
you
will
the
smell
is
floral
and
fruity
and
this
matches
the
taste
it
goes
down
smooth
with
a
faint
fruitiness
mixed
with
the
malt
flavors
the
fruit
flavor
is
apparent
but
not
overwhelming
especially
not
present
enough
to
be
considered
a
fruit
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
its
a
good
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
night
9
brewed
by
magic
hat
brewing
company
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
5
1
and
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
there
is
a
small
white
head
to
this
brew
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
the
taste
is
rich
and
smooth
9
goes
down
with
and
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
there
is
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
of
this
brew
the
bite
is
nothing
over
powering
9
is
a
well
balanced
brew
nothing
over
done
in
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
o
a
good
summer
beer
goes
down
easy
could
drink
a
few
at
one
sitting
but
not
have
the
need
to
repeat
anytime
soon
overall
a
3
75
for
this
refreshing
brew
i
dig
the
faint
fruit
elements
too
the
fact
that
this
is
called
a
fruit
beer
kind
of
puzzles
me
but
i
enjoyed
9
nonetheless
this
brew
would
be
a
great
choice
for
any
hot
sweaty
summer
refreshment
with
a
quality
brew
i
will
certainly
buy
this
brew
again
this
has
really
become
one
of
my
gotos
over
the
past
few
years
im
partial
to
pale
ales
and
though
they
dont
quite
advertise
it
as
one
thats
what
it
is
its
a
little
hard
to
describe
what
makes
it
so
popular
but
i
think
its
that
it
has
a
lot
of
complexity
without
being
overwhelming
i
think
magic
hat
has
been
a
gateway
craft
beer
for
a
lot
of
folks
and
i
think
its
successful
balancing
act
may
be
why
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
amber
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
faded
the
taste
is
fruity
and
refreshing
it
would
be
a
good
beach
beer
overall
its
not
the
best
beer
ever
by
a
long
shot
but
its
not
a
horrible
choice
either
have
had
this
beer
in
the
past
but
probably
not
for
the
last
2
years
bought
it
as
part
of
a
sampler
case
overall
enjoyed
over
the
years
and
such
a
simple
beer
cheers
to
a
sunny
day
random
pick
from
a
mix
your
six
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
and
spit
directly
into
a
sink
to
be
fair
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
fruit
style
beer
but
i
can
appreciate
when
the
style
is
done
very
well
this
one
however
did
not
contain
any
fruit
i
know
in
nature
a
faint
pale
ale
with
semisweet
taste
too
foamy
and
distinctly
cheap
the
magic
is
that
they
are
still
making
this
love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
these
days
ive
had
it
several
times
and
seem
to
like
it
more
each
time
flavor
the
apricot
sweetness
dominates
here
as
well
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
the
sweet
malts
are
throughout
the
taste
with
the
fruit
overriding
all
else
overall
all
around
a
great
beercrisp
and
refreshing
with
fruit
undertones
but
not
a
lot
of
great
visual
aspects
overall
very
average
little
brew
im
not
sure
what
the
supposed
secret
is
but
im
guessing
its
something
along
the
lines
of
we
made
an
ok
pale
ale
and
there
are
thousands
of
ok
pale
ales
so
lets
say
its
got
a
secret
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
to
pick
up
at
the
gas
station
or
local
grocery
that
may
not
have
a
huge
selection
and
a
lot
of
my
friends
that
arent
a
beer
snob
like
myself
swear
by
this
beer
i
guess
my
palette
has
grown
too
refined
i
find
it
drinkable
but
cheap
o
refreshing
but
the
flavors
seem
artificial
pours
out
to
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
a
bit
color
is
a
coppery
gold
aroma
is
much
like
pyramid
apricot
minus
the
sharp
wheat
flavor
is
mild
and
fruity
with
some
pale
and
crystal
malts
shining
through
and
balanced
to
a
crisp
finish
no
discernible
hop
character
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
co2
is
just
right
overall
a
solid
brew
that
pleases
overall
this
used
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
and
probably
would
be
a
preferred
choice
if
there
isnt
good
selection
but
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
anymore
o
good
beer
just
a
little
on
the
light
side
excellent
session
or
hot
weather
beer
that
plays
with
the
taste
buds
just
enough
probably
not
something
i
will
buy
again
but
i
had
to
try
it
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
just
seemed
to
fall
short
of
the
hype
obvious
apricot
infusion
with
sometimes
buttery
notes
on
the
palate
subtle
amount
of
stone
fruits
n
the
palate
throughout
dry
finish
not
the
worst
nor
the
best
pale
alefruity
ale
but
is
very
wearily
drinkable
on
any
day
especially
a
nice
summers
night
cheers
o
i
expected
more
considering
the
hype
id
heard
about
this
brand
in
reality
it
seemed
more
like
an
aal
than
anything
else
according
to
its
description
it
asks
more
questions
than
it
answers
one
question
was
why
did
i
buy
this
in
the
first
place
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
ever
buy
this
again
this
apricotcolored
brew
leaves
poor
lacings
from
a
just
barely
there
head
that
quickly
fizzled
and
died
the
nose
is
also
of
apricots
with
a
dash
of
malts
and
honey
while
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
the
pallet
is
rather
crisp
so
perhaps
this
is
intended
crisp
slightly
malty
and
mildly
sweet
this
beer
is
simple
but
very
refreshing
i
could
definitely
see
myself
throwing
back
a
couple
of
these
while
hanging
out
at
a
bbq
or
at
a
pool
on
a
hot
day
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
great
for
what
it
is
not
a
bad
drink
a
guilty
pleasure
when
i
really
dont
want
to
buy
a
good
beer
this
has
gotten
worse
pass
pour
overall
i
couldnt
recommend
this
beer
i
feel
that
its
really
touting
itself
as
craft
beer
quality
and
it
just
isnt
its
unique
for
sure
in
its
concept
and
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
any
other
beer
ive
had
but
it
isnt
even
remotely
close
to
a
pale
ale
in
taste
or
appearance
o
this
beers
refreshingness
and
drinkability
increase
its
overall
score
certainly
better
than
avg
but
not
quite
outstanding
i
do
however
find
myself
coming
back
to
it
often
now
heading
into
the
winter
however
i
suspect
it
may
be
forgotten
on
the
other
side
of
the
snow
although
a
lot
of
you
have
probably
tried
and
forgotten
this
beer
i
for
one
keep
coming
back
its
one
of
those
beers
you
grab
when
you
dont
know
what
you
want
its
not
overly
showy
or
complex
but
its
still
good
slightly
sweet
overall
with
a
semiclean
finish
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
filling
but
not
too
light
either
best
in
the
summer
but
good
year
round
too
o
this
not
quite
pale
ale
was
not
quite
great
but
i
found
it
really
refreshing
try
it
if
you
have
the
change
because
i
found
it
very
refreshing
fruity
in
a
good
way
and
had
a
nice
after
taste
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
of
them
if
there
isnt
much
on
tap
taste
starts
with
pear
and
bread
then
peaches
and
apricots
with
a
light
malt
and
slightly
soapy
finish
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
average
with
high
carbonation
o
this
is
not
a
beer
for
me
i
didnt
care
for
it
and
really
didnt
like
it
i
couldnt
drink
another
and
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
my
friend
who
isnt
really
a
beer
drinker
thought
it
was
ok
my
experience
has
been
that
women
especially
those
who
dont
drink
beer
will
gravitate
towards
fruit
beers
that
is
only
my
experience
and
i
dont
want
to
offend
anyone
enjoyable
like
nice
summering
mowing
my
lawn
type
of
beer
overall
an
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
with
no
wow
factor
if
you
like
fruit
beers
give
it
a
try

a
good
drinkable

not

beer
o
actually
slightly
better
than
i
expected
decent
pale
ale
nothing
outstanding
and
nothing
id
buy
but
id
drink
again
9
was
good
a
sort
of
mysterious
beer
and
i
dont
typically
hear
much
about
it
i
would
probably
order
it
again
once
spring
and
summer
roll
back
around
but
its
not
something
i
absolutely
have
to
have
i
looked
it
up
later
too
and
it
seems
that
the
key
flavor
was
apricot
which
i
thought
was
interesting
glad
i
didnt
know
ahead
of
time
because
i
would
have
been
disappointed
o
a
good
beer
that
is
not
really
special
in
any
one
area
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
or
two
but
not
necessarily
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
if
i
am
looking
for
something
complex
poured
orangey
yellow
with
a
hazy
body
and
a
white
puff
of
head
that
diminished
quickly
aromas
of
pale
grains
wheat
twang
boiled
vegetables
mild
citrus
and
an
odd
earthy
tone
blended
with
the
apricots
that
is
simply
off
putting
flavors
are
very
similar
with
more
of
a
fruity
kick
in
the
finish
big
carbonation
for
the
thinnish
body
not
really
my
thing
d
very
drinkable
consider
this
a
session
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
magic
hat
easy
to
drink
and
taste
like
a
pale
ale
with
fruit
a
go
to
beer
from
magic
hat
o
enjoyable
clean
fruit
beer
apricot
flavor
not
too
overpowering
nice
finish
just
another
fruit
beer
nothing
worth
searching
for
but
could
serve
a
purpose
on
a
hot
sunny
day
nice
clean
citrus
hop
with
clean
finish
no
bitter
aftertaste
light
to
light
medium
mouthfeel
good
beer
with
a
pleasant
taste
repeat
ale
but
not
a
first
choice
perhaps
a
third
our
fourth
selection
osolid
across
the
board
nothing
truly
outstanding
but
very
good
in
all
aspects
i
keep
getting
reminded
of
a
belgian
maybe
an
apricot
lambic
or
something
like
that
one
way
or
another
i
approve
i
think
its
the
best
of
the
sampler
case
i
bought
overall
i
like
this
but
its
got
too
much
going
on
with
the
sweetness
and
not
all
that
complex
pretty
drinkable
though
that
said
if
you
are
looking
for
a
creative
use
of
apricots
in
beer
try
dfh
aprihop
it
is
superior
to
this
offering
in
every
way
beautiful
color
reddish
gold
color
one
finger
head
that
sustains
carbonation
is
steady
sweet
smell
good
initial
taste
smooth
with
a
light
mouth
feel
starts
out
strong
but
lacks
any
depth
no
aftertaste
overall
its
a
pretty
simple
beer
wont
blow
you
away
would
be
good
for
a
summer
day
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
beer
is
not
a
hop
fest
by
any
means
i
didnt
expect
anything
though
since
the
bottle
is
very
quiet
about
its
contents
overall
i
think
for
whatever
class
it
may
fall
in
it
performed
well
serving
type
bottle
hulk
gold
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
foam
on
top
apricot
on
the
nose
but
it
is
faint
i
take
a
sip
and
whoa
apricot
thats
it
very
one
note
not
intensely
sweet
but
not
too
pleasing
to
taste
the
flavor
definitely
sticks
with
you
well
after
the
swallow
medium
bodied
and
very
clean
body
pushes
through
the
finish
carbonation
is
well
balanced
in
the
beer
a
fruity
pale
ale
that
resembles
british
brews
and
it
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
this
is
a
different
type
of
beer
and
nothing
like
i
expected
not
looking
up
any
reviews
or
other
information
before
tasting
i
assumed
it
was
going
to
be
an
amber
or
pale
ale
but
it
is
nothing
like
that
it
is
actually
a
fruit
accented
beer
and
not
a
bad
one
at
that
it
doesnt
rank
among
my
favorites
but
it
does
have
enough
going
for
it
to
recommend
a
sample
or
two
magic
hat
9
was
so
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
it
didnt
look
as
nice
but
it
smelled
and
just
tasted
better
truly
a
good
brew
to
partake
from
and
one
that
ill
be
enjoying
from
for
thankfully
quite
some
time
of
course
if
the
taste
is
bothersome
then
the
mouthfeel
isnt
gonna
be
much
better
this
beer
truly
wasnt
for
me
i
like
fruit
beers
i
really
do
but
this
no
hell
no
ill
look
at
it
ill
smell
it
but
i
doubt
ill
ever
drink
it
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
agree
with
the
tagline
that
it
is
almost
a
pale
ale
it
doesnt
have
the
crispness
that
i
like
in
a
pale
ale
but
it
is
quite
satisfying
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
hype
to
this
beer
but
it
very
clean
tasting
and
crisp
maybe
i
just
like
the
style
better
than
most
i
dont
think
its
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
for
a
fruit
beer
it
is
light
and
not
overpowering
and
a
great
summer
beer
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
if
you
havent
tried
craft
beer
yet
pours
darker
golden
color
with
thick
foamy
head
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
is
quite
good
and
persists
smells
like
ripened
fruit
but
it
is
more
of
an
artificial
smell
beer
is
very
well
carbonated
with
a
malty
taste
you
can
taste
the
ripened
fruit
but
it
taste
like
artificial
flavoring
there
is
only
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
that
quickly
dissipates
this
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
but
not
one
i
would
particularly
want
when
i
have
a
beer
craving
especially
a
hop
craving
it
just
doesnt
bring
it
all
together
well
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
lackluster
beers
ive
ever
had
it
really
isnt
exciting
by
any
stretch
having
only
a
pleasant
apricot
smell
and
a
slightly
fruityapricot
taste
but
it
is
intriguingly
enjoyable
its
almost
like
a
smooth
light
apricotflavored
lager
this
is
an
easy
summer
drinker
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
overall
always
a
good
standby
and
nonoffensive
beer
good
for
bringing
somewhere
or
ordering
a
lot
of
to
share
overall
not
bad
i
definitely
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
pale
ale
though
im
glad
i
knew
it
was
a
fruit
beer
before
i
cracked
it
open
i
would
have
been
a
little
upset
if
i
was
looking
for
something
more
sessionable
the
label
doesnt
say
anything
about
the
flavor
id
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
day
but
i
wouldnt
run
for
it
o
seems
to
be
an
lack
of
direction
that
leads
to
the
flavors
not
coming
together
well
i
warmed
up
to
it
some
as
the
drink
went
on
but
still
a
bit
of
a
miss
for
me
one
that
i
will
pass
on
in
the
future
when
you
snag
a
bottle
off
the
shelf
that
you
are
totally
in
the
dark
on
sometimes
it
is
a
delightful
surprise
other
times
it
is
a
flop
this
one
was
the
latter
i
feel
like
they
have
watered
this
down
over
the
past
10
years
it
is
a
decent
light
refreshing
beer
and
i
enjoy
it
outside
on
hot
summer
days
but
it
isnt
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
i
think
it
they
made
it
a
little
more
stronger
or
added
some
additional
hopsmalt
this
would
be
fantastic
when
i
first
started
drinking
it
it
did
not
taste
as
light
to
me
i
honestly
think
they
have
watered
it
down
one
of
the
most
unusual
beers
ive
tried
in
a
long
time
and
left
me
confused
on
how
to
rate
it
it
started
very
sweet
and
the
aroma
was
a
very
good
one
that
had
plenty
of
apricot
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
had
more
of
the
same
but
wasnt
quite
as
strong
then
turned
slightly
bland
after
that
which
stuck
me
as
odd
summary
not
my
favorite
beer
thats
for
sure
but
its
not
a
bad
pick
for
a
fruit
beer
really
its
comparable
to
shiners
ruby
redbird
but
not
as
harsh
an
aftertaste
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
drinkable
but
if
somebody
was
to
ask
me
to
point
to
a
badlybalanced
beer
this
is
the
example
i
would
use
drinkability
it
was
ok
but
it
certainly
didnt
taste
like
a
fruit
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
pale
ale
is
the
9
in
reference
to
how
many
attempts
it
took
for
them
to
get
to
this
flavor
profile
maybe
they
should
have
a
10
just
sayin
golden
color
with
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
and
a
decent
head
hoppy
fruity
aroma
sweet
herbal
with
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
slight
bitterness
to
balance
lacks
a
complete
full
body
however
you
can
definitely
feel
the
carbonation
finishes
a
bit
weaker
than
it
started
overall
a
good
beer
that
pleases
the
palate
with
a
unique
flavor
o
not
a
fan
of
this
at
all
its
just
odd
and
displeasing
i
get
the
apricot
presence
but
its
just
not
a
good
apricot
this
would
be
much
improved
if
the
apricot
taste
was
real
and
not
a
syrupy
fake
glad
this
is
my
last
one
in
general
there
are
not
a
lot
of
good
fruit
beers
these
are
sweet
quite
specifically
flavored
dessert
beers
that
are
not
for
everyone
that
being
said
buyer
beware
but
if
you
like
apricot
give
it
a
shot
just
be
warned
that
this
is
not
an
organic
apricot
beverage
these
are
likely
artificial
flavors
poured
into
becker
clear
light
fizzy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
even
from
a
vigorous
pour
that
goes
away
fast
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
clean
malt
and
some
sort
of
artificialseeming
scent
perhaps
this
is
the
apricot
i
keep
reading
about
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
not
as
crisp
as
id
like
a
pale
ale
to
be
that
odd
sweet
flavor
comes
in
and
blurs
things
around
seeming
to
change
places
every
sip
first
its
in
the
front
then
its
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
what
its
trying
to
be
i
can
understand
the
cult
following
it
has
though
it
must
seem
like
a
supercomplex
ultracraft
beer
to
macro
drinkers
o
i
just
cant
get
behind
this
one
the
sweetness
is
too
overpowering
and
artificial
it
doesnt
mix
well
with
the
beer
even
the
beer
behind
the
flavor
is
average
at
best
most
likely
will
not
drink
again
its
okay
its
alright
nothing
special
so
how
do
you
keep
an
ahole
in
suspense
exactly
great
marketing
take
your
average
product
give
it
a
certain
amount
of
mystery
and
wait
to
see
the
results
guess
ill
need
to
taste
some
others
from
this
brewery
to
determione
if
theyre
viable
i
gave
it
a
4
in
taste
though
because
it
did
have
a
firm
discernible
taste
magic

overall
i
understand
this
beer
is
old
but
goddamn
was
i
caught
off
guard
its
like
taking
a
hit
off
a
bong
filled
with
cranberry
juice
its
unique
and
tolerable
but
the
poor
things
i
hear
about
it
are
true
honestly
if
you
gave
this
to
me
blind
id
think
it
was
a
bad
cider
o
for
an
ale
allegedly
cloaked
in
secrecy
their
secret
ingredient
isnt
much
of
a
secret
it
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
great
drinks
pretty
easy
but
it
isnt
what
i
normally
go
for
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
loved
since
my
first
taste
very
light
definite
apricotfruit
smell
and
taste
very
light
on
the
hops
very
light
mouthfeel
i
would
recommend
this
beer
at
a
summer
picnic
or
in
warm
weather
which
i
find
surprising
coming
from
vermont
overall
a
very
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
food
match
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
to
some
extent
and
would
match
well
with
seafood
a
decent
summer
salad
thrown
into
the
mix
also
if
were
talking
red
meat
then
lamb
would
go
down
a
treat
try
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
some
may
be
happy
with
another
its
not
a
top
quality
one
but
it
is
one
to
consider
when
you
need
a
beer
on
a
sunny
day
fairly
spritzy
and
lively
i
enjoyed
it

an

that
could
use

the

is
deftly
done
and
it

first
time
i
ever
saw
any
magic
hat
up
here
clear
golden
ale
with
a
largefrothy
eggshell
white
head
creamy
apricot
and
toffee
aromas
quite
similar
to
pyramid
apricot
wheat
apricot
and
semi
bitter
caramel
malts
maybe
a
touch
of
hop
in
the
very
end
ok
nice
palate
not
bad
good
summer
type
beer
okay
as
a
fruit
beer
goes
drinkable
but
pretty
average
overall
overall
it
is
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
most
people
should
like
it
unless
you
are
oppposed
fruit
flavored
beers
o
not
a
bad
beer
its
definitely
unique
if
youre
looking
for
a
pale
ale
thats
fruit
forward
and
dry
on
the
finish
this
is
your
beer
its
something
that
ill
continue
to
drink
when
im
looking
for
something
slightly
different
than
your
average
pale
ale
overall
i
guess
if
you
want
a
lightly
flavored
strawberrytype
beer
this
might
be
for
you
that
said
though
it
does
not
suit
my
palate
its
relatively
flawfree
so
i
wont
be
drinking
more
of
this
but
someone
might
want
to
o
overall
it
was
pretty
bland
and
artificial
i
strongly
suspect
pomegranate
is
in
this
secret
recipe
honestly
the
beer
was
kind
of
a
letdown
too
bubbly
and
friendly
on
the
pallet
to
be
truly
deep
but
its
flavor
is
somewhat
unique
a
kind
of
effervescent
fruit
ale
i
dont
see
pale
ale
in
it
at
all
but
it
is
different
ohad
it
before
never
reviewed
it
until
now
it
was
actually
better
than
i
remembered
but
still
nothing
special
not
quite
pale
for
sure
i
love
the
ipas
and
and
this
has
allllmost
the
flavor
my
husband
doesnt
like
the
ipas
at
all
but
he
likes
this
one
and
im
hoping
this
is
the
gateway
he
tastes
rasberry
i
do
not
but
a
slight
fruitiness
is
present
pleasant
aroma
a
little
citrus
a
little
fruit
lighter
body
not
too
heavy
good
flavor
like
alot
would
enjoy
again
maybe
it
was
the
fact
that
it
had
to
be
shipped
to
the
west
coast
but
this
beer
wasnt
very
good
at
all
a
good
flavor
is
key
to
a
good
beer
but
it
completely
falls
flat
in
that
category
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
the
notably
bad
beers
ive
known
notes
pretty
underwhelming
this
goes
down
easy
but
has
almost
nothing
to
make
me
want
to
buy
more
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
carbonation
and
an
average
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
consists
mainly
of
the
added
fruit
flavors
apricot
and
the
hops
for
the
taste
9
is
a
decent
pale
ale
with
the
fruit
infusion
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
overly
sweetcloying
as
some
have
claimed
nor
does
it
taste
overtly
artificial
its
a
very
light
beer
that
can
be
quite
a
refreshment
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
it
personally
i
dislike
many
flavored
beers
such
as
cherry
wheat
by
sam
adams
and
flavored
lambics
sugar
bombs
despite
this
like
i
said
i
enjoy
this
beer
for
many
myself
included
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
to
magic
hat
and
microbrews
in
general
it
taught
me
that
beer
can
taste
quite
different
from
the
bmc
staples
of
american
suburbia
overall
this
is
highly
recommended
on
a
summers
day
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
or
if
you
want
to
introduce
someone
to
craft
brewing
for
the
first
time
overall
after
years
of
drinking
this
beer
it
is
amazing
that
i
have
never
reviewed
it
it
is
good
but
when
it
comes
to
apricot
beers
there
are
a
few
other
that
take
the
extra
step
into
perfection
regardless
number
9
will
always
be
a
classic
when
you
go
into
a
bar
and
need
something
to
please
most
crowds
on
a
hot
summer
night
this
beer
is
one
of
the
obvious
gotos
enjoy
one
on
me
salud
overall
i
was
totally
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
smell
was
one
step
above
nasty
and
the
flavor
was
uninspired
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
appearance
and
even
thats
not
impressive
just
tried
this
on
a
whim
and
was
a
bit
disconcerted
when
i
first
opened
it
checked
my
hands
and
the
candles
i
had
burning
what
was
that
perfume
scent
it
was
the
beer
and
i
was
thinking
oh
im
not
going
to
like
this
i
like
things
on
the
line
of
fosters
green
newcastle
brown
ale
and
the
real
guinness
stout
a
touch
of
bitterness
with
some
durable
body
i
dont
like
frufru
beers
dressed
up
with
flavors
glad
i
tasted
it
the
nose
above
the
glass
is
strong
of
peach
scent
not
fresh
peaches
more
like
perfume
which
is
pleasant
but
not
what
im
looking
for
the
taste
is
good
with
the
aftertaste
i
like
in
a
good
ale
a
little
bitter
a
little
lasting
on
the
tongue
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
mandarin
orange
not
peaches
which
fits
well
with
the
body
of
the
beer
it
didnt
linger
in
the
aftertaste
other
than
a
little
citrusy
bitterness
which
i
actually
enjoy
i
like
bitter
tastes
or
overcome
the
character
of
the
ale
speaking
of
body
a
good
fullness
without
being
heavy
a
little
bit
of
zing
like
soda
water
does
i
wasnt
expecting
an
adjunct
flavor
but
this
one
which
i
perceived
as
the
mandarin
was
very
pleasant
the
only
thing
that
is
offputting
to
me
is
the
nose
of
peach
perfume
when
i
take
a
sip
not
fond
of
that
however
i
will
buy
it
again
see
it
as
a
good
summer
beer
and
will
offer
it
to
my
female
friends
who
are
reluctant
to
try
a
better
class
of
beer
but
arent
fond
of
the
stronger
body
that
a
good
beer
has
and
of
course
i
love
the
wisdom
of
the
bottle
caps
but
theyve
never
topped
the
devil
is
in
the
potato
salad
o
not
great
not
horrible
and
a
fun
challenge
i
think
this
is
good
for
home
brewers
and
craft
beer
drinkers
to
sit
around
and
debate
on
what
they
get
out
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
as
far
as
my
take
on
it
ill
never
buy
it
again
but
i
can
get
through
these
six
without
complaining
i
have
had
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
and
i
like
what
they
do
this
one
just
isnt
worth
my
money
decently
sweeter
and
more
flavorful
than
i
remember
it
in
the
past
overall
what
strikes
me
isnt
that
it
necessarily
tastes
bad
its
just
flavorless
and
theres
nothing
going
on
time
to
move
on
even
for
a
fruit
brew
this
isnt
really
delivering
o
calls
itself
a
not
quite
pale
ale
tastes
like
a
fruit
beer
minus
some
sweetness
pretty
good

if
only
at
the
right
time
and
place
they
must
also
be
wellmade
of
course
and
to
that
lets
just
say
that
few
breweries
could
have
an
apricotextract
flagship
brand
and
still
have
the
success
that
magic
hat
has
biegamanoct
05
dfh
aprihop
is
basically
a
better
version
of
the
same
concept
yeah
didnt
love
it
ill
take
it
over
the
big
american
beers
for
sure
fordoct
01
it
tastes
and
feels
more
like
a
fruity
lager
to
me
still
i
never
mind
having
one
in
the
midst
of
a
magic
hat
variety
pack
i
could
reach
deep
and
point
out
positives
aspects
of
this
beer
like
an
interesting
complexity
crispness
and
a
decent
color
but
to
my
palette
the
taste
especially
the
finish
is
something
id
never
want
to
taste
again
ive
had
a
lot
of
pale
ales
and
havent
had
this
reaction
before
maybe
its
just
my
palette
versus
this
particular
beer
this
brew
is
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
refreshing
this
beer
is
just
too
weird
for
me
it
smells
like
perfume
and
if
i
ever
drank
perfume
i
bet
it
would
taste
similar
though
without
the
carbonations
bite
its
really
complex
and
for
that
i
commend
them
they
pack
a
lot
of
fruity
flavors
and
it
finishes
dry
but
i
dont
see
how
a
person
would
be
able
to
enjoy
this
im
sure
it
divides
beer
fans
overall
discovered
this
beer
a
few
months
back
and
have
enjoyed
it
since
this
is
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
magic
hat
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
a
round
of
golf
the
beer
pours
out
like
piss
yellow
and
murky
almost
orange
the
beer
is
practically
the
epitome
of
a
dehydrated
piss
colored
beer
a
thin
scrimhead
of
soapy
white
bubbles
pours
and
stays
as
a
ring
on
the
glass
but
is
not
too
impressive
in
any
way
carbonation
bubbles
are
quite
constant
in
the
glass
and
lacing
is
thin
stringy
and
slippery
the
beer
smells
fruity
with
yeasts
and
a
nice
biscuity
malt
body
there
is
actually
some
sour
funk
in
the
smell
which
must
be
coming
from
the
apricot
extract
the
sweet
side
of
the
fruit
smell
is
at
the
back
of
the
whiff
and
is
slightly
candied
the
beer
tastes
biscuity
with
nice
bread
notes
from
the
yeast
and
a
slight
fruity
tingle
throughout
the
taste
aftertaste
is
strong
with
sweet
biscuit
malts
and
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
little
flood
of
saliva
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
a
little
thin
but
smooth
and
clean
carbonation
is
a
faint
bit
too
high
but
does
not
detract
from
the
beer
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
i
hate
calling
it
a
fruit
beer
because
it
really
isnt
and
then
again
it
isnt
really
a
pale
ale
either
i
guess
magic
hat
had
it
right
when
they
called
it
a
not
quite
pale
ale
but
that
hurts
when
trying
to
judge
this
beer
by
its
style
this
beer
is
a
classic
of
the
more
mass
produced
microbreweries
and
is
very
easily
sessionable
a
nice
go
to
cheap
drink
for
those
who
want
to
try
it
i
dont
think
that
this
beer
will
be
a
regular
addition
to
my
fridge
but
it
may
find
its
way
there
occasionally
overall
im
more
impressed
with
this
last
bottle
that
i
actually
poured
into
a
glass
to
review
and
took
from
the
fridge
the
other
ones
from
the
6
pack
were
consumed
from
the
bottle
and
beer
store
temp
and
i
disliked
them
in
a
big
way
even
poured
half
on
the
grass
this
bottle
is
quite
refreshing
on
this
waning
hot
summer
day
though
i
still
wish
it
was
a
pale
ale
as
mentioned
on
the
label
this
is
an
excellent
beer
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
it
has
a
darker
feel
to
it
while
remaining
rather
light
in
aftertaste
has
quite
a
fruity
taste
to
it
similar
to
a
bells
oberon
yet
it
is
built
more
so
for
any
season
or
occasion
and
doesnt
fit
a
particular
time
of
year
still
its
for
those
who
dont
mind
the
taste
of
a
little
fruit
in
their
beer
o
this
is
a
restrained
fruit
beer
with
the
apricots
still
taking
center
stage
but
not
overwhelming
the
underling
beer
the
problem
is
im
not
that
wild
about
the
underling
beer
the
apricots
might
be
suited
better
on
a
slightly
sweeter
base
style
beer
i
normally
dont
like
fruitinfused
ales
like
this
particularly
if
theyre
apricot
flavoured
but
this
is
an
exception
ill
probably
pick
up
one
in
a
while
now
that
its
available
in
ontario
o
its
not
great
by
any
means
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
nice
gateway
o
not
my
thing
but
very
easy
to
consume
i
have
alway
heard
people
refer
to
this
beer
as
a
pale
ale
which
is
why
i
probably
never
cared
for
it
however
if
i
think
about
it
as
a
fruit
beer
it
is
actually
decent
easily
a
session
drink
if
you
like
fruity
beers
again
not
my
preference
yet
not
undrinkable
its
about
95
degrees
out
and
9s
refreshing
flavor
does
the
trick
now
its
not
a
revolutionary
beer
but
it
has
its
place
this
beer
pours
up
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
1
12
finger
head
as
it
is
being
consumed
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
can
be
observed
the
smell
is
very
subtle
but
a
citrusy
aroma
can
be
perceived
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
sort
of
grassy
with
not
much
bite
to
the
finish
all
in
all
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
fairly
mild
and
a
welcome
occasional
alternative
to
some
of
the
hop
bombs
that
are
available
doa
the
flavor
offers
even
more
fruitiness
and
some
slight
butter
this
is
a
well
carbonated
light
pale
ale
a
good
intro
beer
for
someone
who
is
new
to
craft
beer
good
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
finish
makes
this
beer
somewhat
enjoyable
an
orangish
amber
brew
with
little
head
the
smell
includes
a
hint
of
honey
and
a
floral
note
but
otherwise
nothing
stands
out
taste
includes
a
hint
of
malt
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
a
hint
of
fruit
but
is
very
uninspiring
the
most
you
can
say
is
that
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
an
average
to
slightly
underaverage
beer
a
regular
beer
for
me
but
not
excellent
can
be
found
at
many
bars
around
michigan
reasonably
priced
o
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
no
born
on
date
but
i
think
this
might
have
been
sitting
around
for
a
bit
too
long
mostly
a
standard
pale
ale
the
pour
is
yellow
and
light
head
is
smaller
bubbles
with
good
lacing
but
dissapates
quickly
slight
fruit
on
the
front
of
the
beer
but
goes
away
quickly
to
reveal
a
lighter
ale
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
disappointing
and
almost
flat
final
thoughts
tastes
like
a
scottish
ale
gets
more
interesting
as
it
warms
but
not
much
to
this
one
good
session
brew
for
sure
a
party
pleasing
brew
especially
for
summer
get
togethers
m
pretty
awesome
mouthfeel
if
its
a
hot
day
actually
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
for
being
outside
on
the
4th
of
july
for
instance
i
cant
believe
they
brew
this
all
year
because
it
is
totally
a
seasonal
type
beer
overall
if
you
are
after
a
really
interesting
fruitbased
beer
this
one
is
good
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
have
it
all
the
time
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
a
good
interesting
beer
it
was
a
beautiful
opaque
gold
and
had
a
decent
white
head
smell
was
lightly
fruity
and
not
like
yeast
or
bread
taste
was
like
a
crisp
lager
with
a
hefeweisse
for
me
best
of
both
worlds
not
too
fruity
but
very
pleasing
i
am
not
a
pale
ale
fan
so
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
great
after
being
out
in
the
heat
but
is
more
complex
than
many
summer
seasonals
overall
a
touch
of
fruit
can
be
more
entertaining
than
something
all
out
like
a
lambic
however
i
am
not
sure
that
works
entirely
well
here
the
hop
and
malt
bill
are
very
muted
i
feel
like
they
should
do
more
of
the
heavy
lifting
to
compliment
the
kiss
of
fruit
flavor
not
a
quality
pale
ale
to
start
with
only
the
judicious
amount
of
fruit
makes
this
at
all
interesting
at
the
same
time
quenching
and
easy
to
down
id
put
this
in
the
same
category
as
leinenkugel
sunset
wheat
by
no
means
a
great
or
even
good
beer
but
a
compulsively
drinkable
one
i
remember
when
i
first
started
using
this
website
i
always
used
to
see
this
brew
reviewed
and
i
always
wanted
to
try
it
dont
know
why
maybe
its
somnething
of
what
you
cant
have
you
want
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
light
amber
hue
with
a
two
finger
fast
vanishing
head
and
some
wispy
lacing
not
muchthe
smell
is
dried
apricotstoffee
and
cherries
not
really
strong
aromas
of
one
fruit
but
a
few
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
over
light
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
apricotstangerine
and
confectionary
and
its
very
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
and
overall
yeah
ive
tried
but
wont
be
trying
it
again
cheers

rating

o
though
it
doesnt
have
a
great
rating
on
this
site
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
it
is
so
tasty
and
has
cool
and
crazy
flavors
well
done
its
like
an
apricot
and
rotten
fruit
beer
i
found
it
to
be
absolutely
terrible
one
of
of
only
two
beers
ive
ever
considered
a
drain
pour
im
not
a
big
fan
of
any
of
the
4
beers
i
have
tried
from

none
of
them
were
as

again
and

apologies
to
the

but
the
point
is
that
this
would
be
a
pleasant
light
session
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
for
the
style
not
overly
sweet
and
actually
has
a
decent
body
to
it
very
enjoyable
a
very
light
dry
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
dried
dark
fruits
again
apricots
sticks
out
most
if
you
became
naked
o
a
very
nice
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
feels
refreshing
and
it
slips
down
easily
while
still
not
tasting
bland
overall
i
dont
really
see
any
difference
from
the
bottle
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
and
perhaps
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
those
new
to
craft
very
lite
and
little
complexity
yet
vet
drinkable
o
k
summer
beer
smells
of
apricot
preserves
on
fresh
buttered
toast
the
nose
is
the
highlight
the
apricot
flavor
leans
toward
the
overly
sweet
and
slightly
artificial
thankfully
toasted
malts
and
tangy
wheat
provide
some
balance
to
the
sweetness
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
is
followed
by
a
disappointing
limp
finish
now
i
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
i
guess
but
this
is
a
pretty
pedestrian
beer
im
not
likely
to
revisit
12
oz
bottle
from
traders
joe
pours
deep
golden
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
hay
bready
malt
some
sour
notes
body
is
medium
slightly
crisp
light
hops
bready
and
caramel
malt
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
medium
and
dry
not
very
flavorful
but
easy
drinking
brew
9
is
always
the
first
and
last
beer
that
i
order
as
soon
as
i
enter
a
bar
or
pub
the
taste
and
aroma
is
leagues
above
any
one
else
and
there
is
no
hangover
feeling
if
i
have
had
one
too
many
and
usually
i
always
have
a
morning
head
ache
after
a
night
of
drinking
draft
beer
so
i
definitely
appreciate
magic
hat
for
allowing
the
moment
of
clarity
to
get
out
of
a
one
night
situation
slainte
everyone
overall
meh
nothing
special
tastes
like
a
soupedup
macrobrew
to
me
this
is
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
nothing
special
but
it
has
all
the
basics
and
would
work
as
a
good
intro
to
craft
cant
say
this
is
my
favourite
im
not
a
big
fruit
beer
guy
and
this
was
listed
under
pale
ales
at
the
yardhouse
so
not
what
i
was
really
craving
worth
a
try
though
body
seems
watery
o
a
perfect
summer
drinking
brew
light
and
fruity
with
a
nice
fragrance
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
however
mildly
bitter
citrus
up
front
followed
by
a
nutty
malt
mouthfeel
ending
with
a
kiss
of
apricot
nothing
too
complex
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
good
crisp
refreshing
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
good
introduction
to
craft
good
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
light
lager
was
pretty
awful
worst
beer
ive
had
for
a
while
b
overall
easy
drinking
fine
for
a
warm
day
but
the
fruit
rot
here
is
not
really
to
my
liking
at
least
when
its
not
combined
with
a
stronger
body
or
higher
abv
ive
had
the
9
a
few
times
before
and
thought
it
was
ok
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
really
gave
it
a
chance
to
impress
it
didnt
but
its
still
a
beer
that
i
might
have
on
a
hot
day
if
theres
nothing
nicer
available
golden
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
of
apricots
and
peaches
and
made
me
expect
a
tart
flavor
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
light
fizzy
feel
the
flavor
is
slighlty
nutty
and
fruity
with
a
strong
apricot
flavor
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
after
one
you
may
just
be
sick
of
it
overall
not
a
fan
as
it
is
fairly
underwhelming
the
fact
that
it
isnt
really
coming
under
a
specific
style
doesnt
make
it
a
special
breakout
beer
but
rather
a
failed
experiment
below
par
it
doesnt
do
what
a
pale
ale
should
and
that
is
be
refreshing
and
decently
drinkable
was
keen
to
try
this
when
i
saw
it
not
real
keen
to
buy
another
sadly
a
pale
ale
with
apricot
seems
like
it
could
work
but
this
needs
more
work
o
refreshing
enough
for
a
hot
afternoon
but
not
one
for
developed
palates
o
this
is
a
beer
i
had
very
fond
memories
about
from
college
but
unfortunately
my
palate
has
changedmatured
since
then
still
a
good
beer
for
a
very
warm
spring
afternoon
and
very
refreshing
but
not
as
good
as
remembered
likely
one
i
will
still
grab
in
the
future
o
very
good
light
beer
refreshing
and
bright
this
one
has
never
let
me
down
o
as
a
fruit
beer
definitely
not
for
me
this
one
very
sickly
to
drink
and
i
will
struggle
to
finish
would
not
recommend
strange
beer
that
some
may
enjoy
but
i
sure
didnt
o
i
think
it
takes
a
few
to
get
used
to
the
brew
once
that
happens
it
only
gets
better
pours
a
yellow
gold
with
a
thin
white
cap
a
dried
fruit
bouquet
apricot
is
overpowering
throughout
finishes
with
a
black
peppery
dish
detergent
flavor
thats
nearly
indetectable
through
an
apricot
perfume
that
invades
the
olfactory
via
the
palate
too
gimmicky
to
be
regarded
a
serious
beer
if
it
were
to
be
a
real
beer
id
likely
give
it
an
even
lower
rating
abolutly
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
nose
is
like
roses
parfume
that
becomes
so
overpowering
when
you
drink
it
that
i
felt
i
was
going
to
vomit
after
3
sips
i
am
absolutly
sorry
that
i
wasted
10
on
a
six
pack
just
horrible
the
rest
will
be
trashed
on
the
positive
side
it
looks
like
a
perfect
pale
ale
in
terms
of
srm
color
the
mouthfeel
not
much
here
cant
feel
the
malt
or
hops
very
light
and
watery
i
would
like
to
note
that
after
my
first
few
sips
i
let
the
glass
and
beer
warm
up
to
make
sure
my
flavor
profiles
where
correct
really
cant
stand
the
frosted
glass
thing
rjt
a
decent
brew
by
magic
hat
one
of
my
favorites
back
in
college
this
pours
amber
gold
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
apricots
tangerines
wheat
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
some
pine
flavor
follows
with
light
citrus
sweetness
only
a
small
bit
of
bite
and
a
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
medium
carbonation
listed
as
a
fruit
beer
might
be
a
little
misleading
while
it
is
sweet
and
apparently
contains
fruit
this
is
more
of
a
light
sweet
pale
ale
style
is
between
pale
ale
and
summer
ale
and
has
a
little
spice
a
little
hops
and
some
slight
citrus
i
am
curious
if
they
changed
things
as
others
seem
to
get
a
lot
more
fruit
character
than
i
do
doesnt
finish
as
clean
as
i
would
hope
but
an
okay
beer
overall
magic
hat
has
always
been
very
unique
with
there
beer
making
everyone
i
have
tasted
has
been
excellent
including
9
this
beer
has
an
excellent
color
and
taste
the
smell
is
kind
of
a
fruity
aroma
and
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
light
to
medium
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
the
body
is
a
little
thin
which
could
be
hindering
the
strength
of
the
flavors
however
this
of
course
makes
this
beer
easydrinking
soft
on
the
palate
and
rather
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
a
little
overly
fizzy
but
definitely
assists
the
body
in
creating
a
very
drinkable
beer
o
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
this
too
bad
the
taste
doesnt
match
up
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
one
finger
off
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thickish
covering
moderate
carbonation
first
hit
is
an
intense
chewy
toasty
carmamelly
malt
aroma
followed
by
peach
date
and
caramel
apple
the
taste
is
browned
apple
and
peach
butter
on
toast
this
is
something
different
cant
really
say
i
like
it
but
after
a
6
pack
it
kind
of
grew
on
me
decent
enough
and
quaffable
but
more
or
less
a
meh
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
a
good
beer
either
a
good
entry
into
beer
for
a
non
drinker
featuring
high
drinkability
and
sweetness
if
it
didnt
have
hints
of
less
than
stellar
beer
going
on
in
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
taste
it
would
be
quite
a
pleasant
beer
cheers
o
a
nice
specitality
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
o
i
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
others
likely
would
too
o
definitely
a
good
brew
to
throw
back
not
really
big
into
fruity
beers
but
this
one
comes
across
as
more
of
a
beer
with
some
fruit
flavors
than
just
a
fruit
beer
a
good
one
liked
by
all
o
i
got
my
father
drinking
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
after
being
rolling
rock
fan
for
many
years
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
o
coming
in
knowing
nothing
of
the
beer
aside
from
the
name
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
was
great
in
the
100
degree
heat
of
dallas
sitting
by
the
pool
not
sure
i
could
put
a
bunch
down
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
a
decent
fruit
flavored
beer
though
the
fruit
flavor
could
be
better
integrated
to
mix
with
the
flavors
nice
body
though
lighter
carbonation
would
certainly
benefit
it
a
beer
that
i
imagine
would
be
good
with
a
fruit
dessert
on
a
warm
summer
day
d
this
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
its
alright
overall
i
could
do
without
all
the
sweetness
and
more
citrus
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
off
not
a
goto
ipa
for
me
magic
hat
9
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
had
so
i
guess
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
it
i
cant
say
i
appreciate
it
as
much
as
it
did
about
5
years
ago
but
its
worth
a
try
any
fruit
beer
that
isnt
a
complete
disaster
should
get
bonus
points
o
i
remember
when
this
was
a
go
to
beer
years
ago
now
it
just
doesnt
excite
me
i
can
see
why
people
who
dont
like
beer
gravitate
towards
it
though
hadnt
had
one
in
2
years
not
a
regrettable
decision
but
theres
a
reason
why
ive
steered
clear
o
this
is
perhaps
a
bit
above
average
for
fruit
beer
category
mostly
onedimensional
the
apricot
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
too
much
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
and
its
not
really
worthy
of
being
a
flagship
beer
but
its
decent
i
can
see
it
working
better
on
hot
days
for
sure
pretty
light
good
for
a
warm
day
o
easy
to
drink
popular
drink
for
those
who
enjoy
fruity
beers
o
very
refreshing
beer
but
not
overly
great
i
want
to
like
this
more
than
i
do
but
the
peachapricot
flavors
are
too
strong
the
thickness
of
the
beer
lends
itself
to
syrup
a
little
too
much
and
hits
too
close
to
my
taste
buds
homes
its
just
off
putting
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
as
long
as
its
a
floral
sweet
type
of
hop
flavor
take
the
apricot
flavor
down
a
notch
and
maybe
i
can
learn
to
enjoy
this
brew
until
then
this
is
something
ill
pass
up
for
something
better
in
this
golden
age
of
craft
beer
that
we
live
in
overall
its
an
extremely
light
apricot
ale
not
much
depth
or
flavor
but
the
apricot
does
come
through
o
a
refreshing
beer
good
citrus
hops
but
the
fruit
flavors
are
too
intense
and
come
off
almost
syrupy
will
drink
again
m
dry
and
crisp
with
medium
carbonation
fresh
and
drinkable
o
good
offering
as
a
draft
stand
by
it
has
a
good
solid
taste
and
isnt
too
threatening
id
love
to
pair
this
with
thai
a
beer
that
has
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
and
at
tailgates
floral
aroma
with
some
citrus
nice
medium
sized
white
head
flavor
is
of
apricots
and
other
citrus
fruit
smooth
and
refreshing
have
had
this
in
can
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
like
seeing
more
beers
being
available
in
cans
onot
something
i
would
purchase
again
i
still
have
two
bottles
left
and
will
reevaluate
if
i
can
find
a
decent
pairing
i
dunno
if
this
bottle
is
old
but
it
smells
not
good
kind
of
a
weird
fruity
and
metallic
smell
and
the
metallic
note
is
only
amplified
by
taking
a
drink
there
are
certain
beers
usually
apas
that
just
simply
dont
taste
good
to
my
palate
and
this
beer
has
that
quality
to
me
it
tasted
like
a
much
cheaper
beer
with
a
hint
of
biscuity
malt
overall
i
just
dont
find
it
that
good
34
pint
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
mug
appearance
is
a
good
golden
copper
color
with
a
212
to
3
finger
head
and
moderate
carbonation
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
slightly
darker
and
not
as
hoppy
as
true
pale
ale
the
taste
begins
with
an
undefined
fruitiness
and
leaves
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
are
not
offensive
just
different
hard
to
define
but
lives
up
to
its
name
as
not
quite
a
pale
ale
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
normally
does
not
like
a
pale
ale
o
after
hearing
a
lot
about
this
beer
i
thought
i
would
pick
some
up
i
was
dissapointed
but
its
probably
just
my
own
preference
the
flavor
just
wasnt
for
me
i
will
say
that
this
beer
is
fun
to
try
to
pick
out
all
the
ingredientsflavors
to
its
credit
i
believe
it
is
very
complex
in
flavor
i
just
couldnt
pick
out
everything
myself
serving
type
bottle
appearance
is
not
what
i
expected
cloudy
looks
like
dirty
gold
nice
white
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
head
that
lasts
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
had
a
hard
time
placing
the
smell
i
kept
thinking
of
candy
like
butterscotch
taste
was
easier
to
describe
its
a
really
nice
maltiness
with
pickups
of
wheat
and
a
little
sweetness
alcohol
is
easy
to
pick
up
as
well
2nd
one
went
down
easier
than
the
1st
clean
somewhat
dry
finish
nice
fun
beer
to
drink
and
i
dont
really
go
for
fruit
beers
pretty
straight
forward
flavor
is
mostly
driven
by
the
apricot
extract
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
would
probably
be
pretty
lame
if
it
werent
for
the
apricot
aspect
d
very
pedestrian
not
a
bad
beer
a
couple
of
notches
above
the
typical
bmc
swill
easy
drinking
at
5
1
abv
a
couple
of
these
could
be
had
in
a
sitting
but
i
still
wouldnt
feel
fully
satisfied
there
are
better
options
out
there
o
i
just
finished
a
12
pack
and
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
see
this
a
must
have
i
dont
keep
a
lot
of
beer
in
supply
but
i
am
an
ipa
guy
so
i
doubt
i
would
go
back
to
this
one
often
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
over
all
pretty
average
o
decent
for
the
style
i
think
magic
hat
did
what
they
wanted
this
is
their
flagship
beer
but
for
me
probably
wont
come
back
to
honestly
not
that
thrilled
o
like
other
reviewers
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
has
gotten
so
huge
im
not
overly
impressed
with
other
magic
hat
beers
but
they
are
decent
this
is
among
the
bottom
of
what
ive
tried
from
them
so
far
d
hmm
a
memorable
experience
that
i
shant
repeat
soon
chalk
this
one
up
to
experience
and
life
lessons
sorry
guys
just
not
my
beer
just
a
complete
pass
from
a
brewer
that
isnt
great
to
start
with
perhaps
most
distressing
is
that
this
seems
to
be
the
worst
beer
this
brewer
makes
i
sincerely
believe
that
some
brewers
should
not
be
allowed
out
of
their
state
there
is
no
reason
a
beer
like
this
must
travel
near
1000
miles
certainly
they
have
drains
to
pour
it
down
in
vermont
there
is
just
too
much
going
on
in
too
many
different
directions
it
has
some
interesting
flavors
and
smells
but
they
just
do
not
come
together
for
me
it
is
not
bad
but
too
different
to
really
like
omeh
ive
had
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
just
got
around
to
reviewing
it
its
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
definitely
doesnt
showcase
what
craft
beer
has
to
offer
either
oi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
seen
this
everywhere
but
never
got
around
to
trying
it
until
now
it
is
a
slight
hazy
orange
color
with

just
doesnt

seasonal

i
have

everything

now

this

an

pale

a

had

quite
a
bit

is
left
on

as
well
has
a

aroma
but
i
do
not
think
i
could
identify
it
as
apricot
if
i
did
not
already
know
what
it
was
the
flavor
is
just
something
i
can
get
into
in
fact
i
do
not
liket
it
some
apricot
flavor
but
it
seems
artificial
the
aftertaste
is
not
pleasant
and
it
lingers
the
only
thing
saving
this
is
that
it
is
not
overly
sweet
the
body
is
light
and
maybe
some
floral
hops
taste
i
just
dont
find
this

will

better
then
i
remember
but
all
in

mediocre
as
a

brew
fairly
refreshing

kind
of
boring
it
doesnt
know
if
it
wants
to
be
a

beer
or
a
pale

and
ends
up
compromising
in
an
unsatisfying
way
dvery
much
so
but
i
dont
know
about
an
extended
session
sweetness
may
eventually
get
a

tiresome
overall
the
price
is
a
bonus

for
a
bomber
not
to
enjoyable
for
me
at
least
is
this
the
211
of
craft
brews
d
i
have
to
be
in
a
certain
mood
to
drink
this
beer
its
light
body
and
subtle
flavors
make
it
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
and
in
the
right
situation
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
getting
sick
of
the
sweetness
but
too
be
in
the
real
of
a
good
micro
it
needs
more
hops
and
malt
the
first
time
i
ordered
this
i
was
out
on
a
date
with
my
girlfriend
and
the
water
told
me
it
was
a
pale
ale
i
was
very
surprised
and
repulsed
when
my
drink
came
only
later
did
i
find
out
that
it
was
a
fruit
beer
d
light
refreshing
not
overpowering
all
around
decent
beer
drinkability
not
too
bad
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
but
if
its
where
i
happen
to
be
then
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
cheers
definitely
not
my
favorite
i
wish
magic
hat
would
make
their
odd
notion
09
a
standard
but
i
believe
this
is
their
most
popular
brew
this
was
interesting
its
not
really
like
anything
ive
had
before
apricot
taste
is
what
this
is
all
about
its
hard
to
discribe
but
to
me
it
tastes
alot
like
plants
or
earthy
as
some
say
the
after
taste
is
interesting
and
the
flavor
keeps
you
intrigued
but
at
no
point
is
great
i
think
this
was
diffrent
enough
from
other
beers
for
me
to
order
it
again
sometime
but
not
something
id
say
i
liked
alot
td
palate
follows
the
nose
light
bodied
fruit
beer
with
a
crisp

really
good
summer
beer
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
9
does
it
right
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
drink
a
lot
of
mouthfeel
is
neutral
not
a
lot
going
on
its
a
little
crispy
on
the
sides
of
the
palate
this
beer
is
drinkable
if
its
your
thing
kind
of
a
long
way
to
ship
them
d
this
is
very
drinkable
because
there
are
not
strong
flavors
so
none
to
get
sick
of
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
its
rather
low
in
alcohol
it
seems
like
a
beer
too
please
everyone
but
not
astonish
anyone
d
this
is
good
not
a
pale
ale
which
i
guess
the
label
says
its
still
good
though
i
do
like
this
beer
medium
body
with
lithter
and
sort
of
unpleasant
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
an
interesting
beer
the
taste
was
constantly
evolving
which
was
good
and
bad
notes
i
dont
know
about
this
beer
it
was
interesting
and
nonconvertional
it
could
have
been
worst
its
worth
a
try
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
again
but
u
never
know
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
and
with
a
relatively
low
abv
and
lighter
body
is
easily
sessionable
d
if
the
flavor
doesnt
get
to
you
it
has
great
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
low
but
if
youre
a
hophead
or
a
devote
fruit
beer
fan
you
probably
wont
like
it
its
too
middle
ground
to
appease
hard
core
fans
in
either
camp

was

let
down

it

feel
that
was

looking
to
have
another

for

this
is

with
a
solid
hop
presence
moderate
apricot
glides
through
the
entire
sip
making
an
interesting
citric
pairing
with
the
hops
coming
through
the
middle
and
finishing
the
beer
fairly
dry
some
grassy
herbal
flavor
light
buttery
flavor
in
the
middle
with
a
touch
of
apple
and
apricot
slight
piney
aftertaste
a
bit
rough
edged
well
carbonated
and
very
crisp
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
for
hazy
late
summer
new
england
a
quirky
interesting
beer
that
i
always
enjoy
not
a
terrible
summer
beer
and
with
its
popularity
could
be
somewhat
refreshing
though
this
certainly
isnt
one
of
my
top
beers
id
probably
have
another
one
again
overall
a
solid
pale
alefruit
beer
something
different
for
a
change
of
pace
this
beer
has
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
white
foamy
head
smells
wow
like
a
bag
of
dried
apricots
and
nothing
else
i
swear
i
could
reach
in
the
glass
and
pull
out
some
dried
apricots
taste
is
mild
up
front
with
the
taste
of
dried
apricots
in
the
middle
and
a
hoppy
finish
not
too
artificial
tasting
quite
refreshing
could
be
more
interesting
if
the
apricots
had
a
sour
or
tart
flavor
overall
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
humid
day
to
start
things
off
clear
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
very
fruity
more
like
plums
than
apricots
i
think
but
maybe
its
just
me
or
the
bottle
this
beer
seems
to
taste
different
everytime
i
have
it
there
is
also
a
hops
aroma
that
smells
kind
of
like
ashes
but
in
a
good
way
very
mild
flavor
this
time
with
a
lot
of
fruitiness
hops
come
through
at
the
end
but
not
too
strong
i
could
drink
this
all
day
medium
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
thicker
just
a
little
though
overall
real
nice
but
good
god
this
beer
changes
everytime
i
drink
it
usually
pleasantly
surprised
though
under
the
cap
have
3
gotta
pee
all
i
can
say
is
dont
break
the
seal
man
deep
golden
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
effervescent
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aromas
of
citrus
and
fruit
with
a
bit
of
graininess
wheat
to
it
palate
is
quite
thin
and
i
found
it
slightly
watery
flavors
of
honey
orange
and
corriander
stand
out
slight
metallic
aftertaste
this
is
slowly
becoming
my
staple
beer
its
strange
like
everything
magic
hat
doesbut
this
beer
tastes
different
everytime
i
drink
it
ive
tried
it
on
tap
and
it
tasted
totally
different
than
in
the
bottle
when
poured
a
thick
white
head
remained
leaving
trails
of
sticky
lace
left
an
instant
warming
feeling
in
the
stomach
color
is
a
crystal
clear
light
gold
first
taste
is
a
spicy
ginger
followed
by
a
dry
bitterness
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
very
fruity
with
a
cherrylike
taste
light
bodied
with
a
foamy
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
easy
leaves
a
strong
aftertaste
of
many
different
flavors
gingerwheatand
hops
a
bit
watery
which
surprises
me
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
great
for
a
summer
day
9
poured
a
golden
color
with
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
and
a
frothy
white
head
the
head
dissapated
to
a
thin
film
that
was
continuously
reinforced
from
the
high
carbonation
the
aroma
was
my
favorite
part
very
floral
and
fruity
full
of
apricot
and
other
soft
and
sweet
fruit
notes
the
taste
fills
the
mouth
with
the
same
apricot
background
and
a
mild
hoppy
bite
bittersweet
to
start
and
crisp
on
the
finish
this
is
actually
the
first
microbrew
i
ever
had
and
began
my
love
affair
with
the
magic
hat
family
i
would
recommend
and
type
of
mh
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
very
unique
and
easily
enjoyed
all
year
round
9
pours
a
gold
with
a
slight
orange
hue
there
was
a
thick
white
head
present
after
the
pour
the
head
did
give
way
to
a
nice
lace
to
the
end
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
bit
different
from
other
brews
there
is
an
oakysmokey
aroma
there
with
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
has
a
malt
flavor
to
it
and
hops
and
that
fruit
again
maybe
it
is
apricots
or
peaches
as
the
malt
leaves
in
the
flavor
the
hops
take
over
and
then
there
is
the
peaches
again
well
worth
the
effort
to
drink
one
beer
that
i
will
have
again
everything
about
this
beer
screams
apricot
hazy
apricotorange
color
brings
forth
mental
images
of
apricot
skins
and
dried
apricots
the
aroma
is
heavily
dominated
by
apricot
with
some
subtle
lighter
more
syrupy
fruit
flavors
underneath
naturally
the
flavor
is
similarly
loaded
with
fruit
never
one
to
mind
a
little
sweetness
in
his
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
the
concept
but
i
can
imagine
this
one
being
especially
popular
the
apricot
flavor
is
true
to
form
with
a
very
dried
apricot
sense
and
the
surprisingly
crisp
finish
is
not
really
bitter
but
extraordinarily
clean
dont
blink
or
youll
have
drank
this
one
before
you
even
notice
its
in
your
glass
orangegold
color
with
a
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
nothing
but
apricots
apricots
are
in
the
taste
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
expected
taste
is
malty
with
a
slight
hoppy
dryness
i
expected
beer
flavored
with
apricots
to
be
incredibly
sweet
but
this
was
dry
and
quite
pleasing
about
five
years
ago
9
was
my
first
and
most
frequent
magic
hat
brew
now
id
have
to
say
its
toward
or
even
at
the
bottom
of
my
magic
hat
list
which
certainly
isnt
to
say
its
a
bad
brew
cause
its
not
as
i
remember
it
in
the
past
the
apricot
taste
used
to
be
much
more
subtle
than
it
is
now
while
still
the
most
drinkable
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
9
seems
to
pack
a
bit
more
of
an
apricot
punch
lately
its
still
amazingly
dry
and
lacking
in
a
good
way
in
the
sweetness
that
most
fruit
beers
bring
to
the
table
also
id
like
to
see
it
pour
with
a
bit
more
head
as
well
but
maybe
thats
just
me
overall
still
a
fine
brew
thats
quite
good
the
hat
may
be
magical
but
a
ringwoodladen
apricot
brew
rolls
a
d20
and
comes
up
with
a
1
when
attempting
to
cast
impress
shirfan
not
a
bad
brew
and
definitely
different
but
i
wont
rush
out
to
buy
any
more
of
these
the
taste
was
of
malt
hops
butter
apricot
with
a
grainy
residual
taste
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
the
residual
of
grain
or
husk
was
very
unappealing
to
me
the
body
is
medium
with
a
crisp
finish
that
flows
very
smoothly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
i
might
sample
this
again
someday
but
i
dont
ever
see
myself
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
a
little
disappointing
yet
what
spurred
me
to
write
a
review
was
drinking
it
on
tap
and
realizing
how
much
i
really
do
enjoy
it
i
find
it
sweeter
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
its
not
for
everyone
but
another
fantastic
and
original
beer
from
magic
hat
good
mouthfeel
and
i
could
drink
alot
of
these
a
very
pretty
deep
orange
color
with
very
creamy
head
aromas
of
earthy
hops
and
musty
aprocot
pits
it
has
a
full
mouthfeel
and
a
long
toasted
malty
finish
thats
a
little
soapy
a
fruit
is
detectable
in
the
flavor
but
if
the
bottle
didnt
tell
me
that
its
apricot
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
there
is
also
a
lemony
hop
flavor
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
this
fruit
beer
didnt
work
for
me
very
well
but
it
was
eye
candy
hazy
light
peach
hue
one
fingered
well
retained
head
leaves
lace
ripe
sugary
apricot
and
light
lovibond
caramel
dominate
the
aroma
mild
butterscotch
and
faint
citric
hops
are
secondary
unique
but
not
particularly
enticing
aromawise
transiently
sharp
hop
bitterness
fades
quickly
revealing
an
agreeable
fruit
driven
combination
of
sweet
nectar
like
apricot
essence
and
a
clementine
citrus
hop
flavor
light
caramel
along
with
bread
and
butter
notes
curface
mid
palate
and
linger
until
cessated
abrupted

the
surprisingly
dry
cracker
like
finish
lightly
bodied
and
appropriately
crisp
if
intended
to
by
a
fruity
quaffer
kuods
to
magic
hat
for
using
a
light
pale
ale
as
the
base
for
a
fruit
beer
rather
than
the
typical
insipid
wheat
or
blonde
ale
base
it
grew
on
my
palate
the
more
i
sipped
the
apricot
presence
remains
a
notch
shy
of
becoming
cloying
refreshing
a
nice
change
hazy

aroma
is
of
faint

overpowered
by
the
sweet
apricot
perhaps
a
hint
of
honey
and
floral
flavor
is
of
immediate
sweet
apricot
with
undertones
of
honey
but
nearly
no
hops
and
definitely
no
malt
crisp
mouthfeel
a
little
wet
there
seems
to
be
a
very
faint
hops
aftertaste
and
then
that
also
is
overpowered
by
a
sweet
apricot
aftertaste
that
overpowers
too
crisp
and
sweet
for
me
and
not
balanced
in
any
respect
very
sweet
up
front
with
more
of
that
amazing
apricot
flavor
lively
carbonation
quite
refreshing
not
a
particularly
hop
infested

but
more
than
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness

in

the
most
balanced
and
appetizing
fruit
beer
i
have
had
to
date
pyramid
apricot
ale
could
learn
a
good
lesson
in
balance
from
this
one
smooth
mouthfeel
with
sweet
malt
and
apricot
flavors
omnipresent
but
never
overstated
hoppy
up
front
and
somewhat
dry
at
the
end
a
fascinating
beer
for
this
type
and
one
that
finally
gets
it
right
in
terms
of
maintaining
harmony
between
fruit
and
ale
god
bless
the
peacemakers
at
magic
hat
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
thin
white
head
the
head
fades
quickly
but
leaves
behind
a
thin
patchy
layer
of
foam
the
aroma
is
earthy
woody
hops
and
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
some
alcohol
esters
are
also
present
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
woody
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
some
bitterness
at
the
end
but
overall
it
tastes
like
im
chewing
on
a
stick
not
a
good
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
i
still
have
that
sawdust
feeling
going
on
drinkability
well
lets
see
ill
finish
it
but
im
glad
loren
only
brought
me
one
this
beer
is
as
odd
as
the
beatles
revolution
9
but
nowehere
near
as
good
give
me
another
blind
faith
or
heart
of
darkness
keep
the
9
somewhat
dark
straw
colored
without
much
head
on
it
subtle
aroma
of
apricots
in
it
taste
of
apricots
is
evident
but
not
overpowering
medium
body
wheat
beer
drinks
very
easily
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
slightly
better
than
the
pyramid
although
i
do
like
the
juju
ginger
which
is
similar
with
ginger
added
to
the
style
although
magic
hat
produces
some
good
beers
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
yet
no
9
does
seem
to
be
a
very
popular
brew
my
advice
would
be
to
try
this
one
on
tap
if
possible
paired
with
a
spicy
meal
that
might
stand
in
contrast
to
the
fruity
sweetness
of
the
beer
i
poured
this
beer
out
and
my
first
smell
of
it
was
a
bit
disconcerting
pine
sol
came
to
mind
although
the
smell
of
lemons
came
through
the
beer
poured
out
a
slightly
orange
gold
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
receded
quickly
the
taste
wasnt
that
bad
tangy
and
tart
with
some
hops
there
a
drinkable
and
interesting
beer
but
i
would
go
for
something
else
first
what
is
9
a
reference
to
john
lennons
repetitious
refrain
on
the
white
album
and
whats
with
the
hippyish
label
design
ah
im
beginning
to
see
the
psychedelic
connection
here
a
more
significant
question
is
why
add
the
essence
of
fruit
flavoring
apricot
to
a
beer
when
it
would
be
a
far
better
achievement
to
brew
the
apricots
into
the
beer
like
a
lambic
i
dont
know
while
its
not
really
a
bad
beer
it
certainly
could
be
much
more
9
is
a
little
too
thin
and
the
added
flavoring
masks
the
hop
flavor
interesting
nose
though
thanks
to
purplehops
and
unclejimbo
for
the
trades
a
good
summer
beer
pat
clear
yellowish
gold
very
very
light
amber
some
sticky
head
that
doesnt
linger
fruity
aroma
mostly
from
the
yeast
surprisingly
dry
which
is
its
best
feature
that
hop
quality
really
brings
out
the
best
possible
flavor
not
at
all
bitter
like
many
hoppy
beers
but
pleasantly
dry
refreshing
crisp
all
the
while
maintaining
a
sweettart
fruity
character
that
should
appease
the
cosmo
and
sangria
crowd
if
you
dont
like
apricots
i
wouldnt
worry
about
it
because
their
presence
is
minimal
if
you
dont
like
fruit
beers
you
might
want
to
try
this
anyway
since
you
are
going
to
find
plenty
of
american
ales
that
taste
just
as
fruity
from
the
ringwood
yeast
still
it
is
very
strange
that
this
has
become
magic
hats
biggest
beer
i
guess
the
sweetness
and
fruitiness
appeals
to
a
large
crosssection
of
people
for
a
better
introduction
and
more
beerlike
beer
look
to
blind
faith
or
better
yet
heart
of
darkness
very
fruity
apricot
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
wheat
hazy
orange
in
color
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
head
the
combination
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
struck
me
as
a
bit
fruitsoda
like
at
first
but
grew
on
me
as
the
beer
warmed
apricot
dominates
the
flavor
of
course
but
the
wheat
is
definitely
noticeable
and
adds
a
very
satisfying
dryness
to
the
finish
along
with
a
somewhat
grainy
aftertaste
im
definitely
drinking
this
in
the
wrong
season
its
not
a
winter
beer
crisp
mouthfeel
and
dry
finish
would
make
this
a
great
appertif
for
a
summer
barbecue
this
was
a
little
below
average
and
one
of
the
beers
i
do
not
often
get
when
thinking
of
magic
hat
sadly
most
of
my
friends
know
magic
hat
for
this
beer
the
beer
poured
light
with
a
white
head
that
reminded
me
of
some
macro
swill
pours
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
were
overbearingly
apricotish
without
any
real
complexity
it
was
also
very
watered
down
i
feel
that
9
has
been
left
in
my
bathroom
as
an
air
freshener
overall
i
would
call
this
beer
a
bit
on
the
wishy
washy
side
it
would
be
light
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
doesnt
go
far
enough
in
any
flavor
direction
it
is
slightly
watery
not
very
hoppy
not
very
malty
and
essence
of
apricot
is
pushing
it
if
it
is
going
to
be
an
apricot
flavored
beer
then
let
us
have
some
apricot
if
the
apricot
is
to
be
a
mystery
flavor
as
i
guess
they
want
it
to
be
then
bring
the
malt
or
the
hop
flavor
to
the
forefront
a
little
more
imho
this
beer
is
just
to
neutral
and
average
this
may
be
the
first
beer
that
i
ever
drank
back
in
highschool
i
liked
it
then
now
i
still
like
it
im
more
of
a
fan
of
darker
beers
so
i
wouldnt
normally
consume
this
but
i
just
cracked
a
bottle
from
the
9pack
i
bought
my
girlfriend
i
do
like
apricot
so
therefor
i
do
like
this
beer
one
is
enough
for
me
tonight
however
im
still
a
fan
of
the
9
pours
a
clear
orange
gold
with
a
thin
but
persistent
white
head
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lace
down
the
glass
aroma
is
of
apricot
and
yeast
even
though
i
dont
think
its
a
wheat
beer
it
reminds
me
of
many
wheats
ive
had
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
beginning
with
wheat
and
malt
and
a
finishing
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
apricot
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
dry
and
drinkable
a
very
good
fruit
beer
thanks
to
lupe
sending
this
one
my
way
not
a
big
fruit
beer
drinker
i
hedged
on
trying
this
quite
glad
i
did
the
fruit
flavor
did
over
power
the
dryness
of
the
beer
it
kind
of
made
you
pucker
with
each
sip
a
truelly
remarkable
beer
in
its
own
rite
pours
as
a
very
light
blond
forming
a
nice
thinly
laced
head
fruity
aromas
dominate
the
nose
berry
among
the
strongest
with
an
accompaniment
of
wheat
great
taste
for
a
fruit
beer
berry
flavored
with
a
taste
of
apricot
dry
and
light
bodied
very
effervescent
finishes
crisp
like
an
ice
beer
honeyorange
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
about
four
years
ago
and
i
was
very
impressed
fruity
and
sweet
are
the
first
things
that
i
notice
not
a
bit
fruit
beer
guy
but
this
is
good
everything
is
well
balanced
from
the
fruit
to
the
malt
crisp
body
clean
refreshing
fruity
taste
not
to
sweet
i
dont
like
peach
and
i
like
this
beer
small
hint
of
hops
smooth
fruity
aftertaste
highly
recomend
this
one
a
great
summer
beer
and
has
certainly
been
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
close
to
pyramid
apricot
but
i
still
prefer
pyramid
pours
a
golden
color
with
nice
head
that
leaves
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
apricot
and
peach
aromas
hit
you
right
away
nice
mouthfeel
light
slightly
hoppy
and
not
overly
fruity
with
some
apricot
flavors
balanced
nicely
for
a
fruit
beer
magic
hat
products
are
now
on
my
list
of
beers
to
pick
up
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
easy
to
drink
golden
color
nice
full
white
head
super
sweet
aromas
smells
like
inside
of
the
standard
marriot
fruit
basket
from
arms
length
closer
inspection
uncovers
subtle
hop
aromas
full
of
fruit
goodness
noticable
apricot
taste
hits
then
more
subtle
raspberry
and
even
some
slight
crisp
apples
not
fuzzy
syrupy
and
slick
like
some
other
fruit
ales
more
a
crisp
dry
hoppy
induced
finish
very
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
a
true
summertime
treat
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
have
enjoyed
or
even
tried
a
few
years
back
because
of
the
obvious
fruitiness
smell
that
hits
you
in
the
face
as
soon
as
you
get
it
but
now
for
some
reason
it
interests
me
the
beer
has
a
nice
goldenalmost
red
color
with
a
decent
head
that
didnt
seem
to
last
too
long
not
much
lace
either
i
found
the
beer
very
drinkable
especially
with
that
smell
close
behind
the
taste
doesnt
last
long
and
at
the
end
it
almost
hints
at
being
watery
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
noticed
it
in
the
bottle
as
well
overall
a
fun
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
slightly
fizzy
head
on
it
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
apricots
and
not
much
else
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
strong
apricot
flavor
and
then
transitions
into
the
odd
but
enjoyable
ringwood
flavor
before
going
somewhat
bitter
at
the
end
the
brew
is
slick
and
has
a
medlight
body
which
makes
for
some
good
drinkablity
i
never
used
to
like
this
beer
when
i
tried
it
in
the
past
but
i
am
definitely
thinking
it
would
make
a
great
session
brew
nowadays
thanks
to
bierman9
for
the
sample
the
first
of
the
magic
hat
beers
i
sampled
and
i
was
impressed
it
was
smooth
and
fruity
and
went
down
great
plain
and
simply
it
was
a
job
well
done
with
a
fruit
beer
not
too
much
apricot
and
a
good
solid
lager
to
make
it
just
right
excellent
beer
very
appealing
color
and
the
fruity
smell
is
present
but
not
overpowering
tastes
delicious
and
the
apricot
flavor
is
excellent
not
too
strong
so
it
still
tastes
like
beer
hopefully
i
can
find
this
in
southeast
pa
it
rocks
my
world
thanks
to
davo
for
the
sample
this
beer
is
just
heavenly
i
am
yet
to
taste
a
beer
from
magic
hat
that
i
did
not
like
great
golden
color
fruity
aroma
sweet
but
not
overkill
taste
great
blend
of
apricot
a
perfect
beer
to
compliment
spicy
food
i
love
it
with
buffalo
wings
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
fruity
pale
ale
very
smooth
melded
flavors
of
malts
hops
and
apricots
great
party
and
bbq
brew
i
really
like
this
brew
great
golden
color
with
nice
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
the
apricot
aroma
smacks
you
in
the
face
from
the
moment
the
bottle
is
opened
i
didnt
think
that
i
would
like
fruit
beers
but
this
on
is
alot
of
fun
to
drink
i
was
excited
to
see
the
m
h
beers
finally
availiable
in
a
store
near
me
i
picked
up
a
six
of
the
9
they
also
had
fat
angel
and
rushed
home
put
the
beers
in
the
fridge
saw
on
the
back
label
that
it
had
essence
of
apricot
added
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
not
being
the
biggest
fruit
beer
fan
but
said
what
the
hell
i
cant
let
it
go
to
waste
its
actually
not
that
bad
not
too
sweet
with
a
nice
apricotpeachpear
nose
its
a
bit
light
in
body
maybe
because
its
brewed
with
a
bit
of
wheat
in
it
as
i
drink
it
its
becoming
more
pleasant
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
itll
be
a
repeat
purchase
oh
yeah
the
bottlecap
mine
said
dont
yap
when
you
nap
i
was
not
impressed
seemed
lacking
on
all
levels
except
smell
i
think
my
expectations
were
oo
high
i
do
not
llike
this
beer
at
all
i
hear
alot
of
people
love
this
one
and
when
bars
have
magic
hat
on
tap
it
usually
this
one
and
i
just
dont
understand
why
this
to
me
is
their
worst
beer
it
is
way
to
fruity
with
a
very
sacharine
sp
after
taste
that
takes
forever
to
go
away
one
of
the
more
subtle
fruit
flavored
brews
very
drinkable
without
being
overwhelming
my
favorite
summer
beer
i
know
its
available
all
year
but
i
like
it
on
the
colder
side
on
a
warm
afternoon
dry
yet
refreshing
light
but
not
whimpy
beautiful
aroma
im
not
big
on
fruit
beers
lambics
etc
aside
but
i
thought
this
to
be
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
better
than
most
others
in
its
style
very
easy
to
drink
packed
with
fruity
apricot
flavour
and
has
a
nice
dry
crispness
about
it
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
i
cant
even
fathom
the
still
make
this
beer
there
have
been
many
amazing
things
added
to
beer
blueberries
grapefruit
etc
but
beets
beets
are
a
punishment
and
create
a
really
horrible
beer
its
not
secret
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
magic
hat
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
it
was
seriously
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
experienced
o
not
overly
impressive
but
somewhat
decent
fruit
beer
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
one
again
i
dont
know
what
to
say
my
notes
on
this
are
a
little
rough
but
ill
try
to
turn
them
down
i
just
thought
the
taste
of
beets
was
there
and
it
just
wasnt
a
good
thing
i
looks
cool
as
a
result
but
i
just
dont
think
it
works
unless
maybe
youre
dwight
schrute
hard
to
get
past
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
head
and
some
really
nice
lacing
nose
is
a
wheat
with
a
little
fruit
flavor
is
washed
out
malt
with
indistinct
fruit
compliments
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
this
smells
like
a
bitter
root
to
me
the
flavor
profile
is
well
boring
with
all
that
crap
they
are
using
in
this
beer
i
was
expecting
at
least
a
bit
more
punch
alas
there
is
not
much
to
this
except
faint
drab
hints
of
whocareswhatitis
nice
label
boring
beer
originally
reviewed
07112011
dont
be
too
hard
on
this
one
its
a
clever
summer
brew
pours
a
hazy
pink
color
from
beet
juice
added
with
a
short
white
head
without
much
retention
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
plenty
of
yeasty
spice
going
on
and
a
very
light
body
flavor
of
the
beets
does
not
really
come
through
its
more
of
a
visual
thing
but
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
with
nice
flavor
imparted
by
the
yeast
sort
of
sweet
for
just
a
second
at
the
end
before
fading
out
slowly
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
feel
is
fine
very
very
light
a
good
summer
session
with
intense
carbonation
overall
i
like
it
not
my
first
choice
but
a
very
drinkable
seasonal
that
is
perhaps
being
treated
a
bit
too
harshly
here
on
ba
appearance
is
interesting
with
roseamber
hue
and
pink
tinged
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
weak
vegetables
and
cranberries
and
not
much
else
taste
is
disappointing
also
with
soapy
tones
and
thin
malt
no
hop
presence
evident
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
uninteresting
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
i
do
give
them
credit
for
trying
something
outside
the
safety
zone
o
ok
so
its
past
its
best
by
date
i
didnt
look
until
after
i
drank
it
that
being
said
this
is
a
fing
strange
beer
not
awful
but
feels
more
like
a
wine
cooler
with
less
sugar
not
recommended
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
beer
flavor
was
really
not
impressive
dry
strawlike
and
lagerlike
slight
caramel
no
body
and
highly
carbonated
kind
of
like
drinking
dirty
soda
water
very
light
bodied
and
not
very
good
sweet
and
tastes
really
cheap
i
would
certainly
avoid
this
again
the
really
high
carbonation
kills
this
one
yuck
overall
so
so
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
was
just
old
or
what
but
i
had
been
leery
of
magic
hat
in
the
past
i
have
not
found
one
beer
brewed
there
to
my
liking
sorry
guys
keep
trying
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
on
an
extremely
hot
summer
day
it
is
refreshing
but
in
an
odd
way
i
allowed
my
love
of
a
bargain
to
overtake
my
love
of
beer
on
this
one
as
i
picked
up
an
assorted
12
pack
of
magic
hat
summer
scene
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
staring
at
what
is
essentially
a
purple
colored
beer
but
given
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
called
wacko
i
have
nobody
to
blame
but
myself
the
smell
is
what
one
might
encounter
at
an
overpriced
candy
store
in
some
touristy
area
an
artificial
yet
enjoyable
sugary
fruitiness
much
like
taffy
the
sugary
fruitiness
continued
into
the
taste
but
was
joined
with
an
earthy
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
had
very
much
a
fluffy
dessert
feel
to
it
despite
my
initial
hesitation
once
i
let
go
of
my
preconceptionspretentions
i
actually
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
there
is
a
solid
base
to
this
beer
beneath
its
initial
appearance
i
could
seriously
consider
sessioning
this
sometime
overall
this
is
decent
fare
having
many
good
flavors
and
characteristics
but
lacks
something
to
set
it
apart
from
the
field
and
begs
for
a
shot
of
brown
sugar
and
at
least
a
light
hop
kick
good
beach
fare
then
but
not
something
to
take
to
a
beer
tasting
the
aroma
translates
almost
exactly
to
the
taste
adjunct
lagerlike
corn
malt
taste
with
an
interesting
vegetable
flavor
im
guessing
beets
again
but
im
not
quite
certain
some
hops
add
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
it
lingers
throughout
the
taste
and
finish
leading
to
a
dry
finish
and
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
odd
as
well
with
that
vegetable
taste
lingering
its
refreshing
for
sure
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
refreshing
beers
that
i
like
the
taste
of
better
great
bottle
cap
though
of
course
banana
costumes
by
nature
are
funny
made
me
chuckle
reddish
copper
in
color
the
beer
pours
with
very
little
head
and
it
produced
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
both
somewhat
offfeeling
with
a
tart
twang
and
that
maltyadjuncty
character
that
reminds
me
of
cheap
kegs
in
college
getting
past
that
there
is
a
touch
of
caramel
some
sweet
vegetal
notes
come
through
but
really
it
just
doesnt
work
all
that
well
vegetal
hops
are
a
nono
i
feel
the
same
about
beets
in
my
beer
im
not
dwight
schrute
off
flavors
in
the
finish
not
diggin
this
though
it
is
much
better
straight
from
the
bottle
overall
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
its
really
not
terrible
just
odd
hard
to
pinpoint
exact
overall
flavor
impression
o
well
i
think
the
color
and
the
label
were
the
best
things
about
this
beer
i
was
not
overly
impressed
although
i
do
give
magic
hat
credit
for
trying
something
different
but
different
is
not
always
good
the
taste
is
light
and
malty
with
the
same
annoying
tang
thats
in
the
smell
no
trace
of
hops
bad
aftertaste
not
enjoyable
and
hard
to
get
down
high
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
terrible
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
brew
to
my
friends
there
are
better
summer
brews
available
overall
not
a
fan
dont
know
if
its
a
c
beer
but
its
not
something
i
would
want
to
try
again
the
color
throws
me
off
i
always
appreciate
the
creativity
and
therefore
i
wasnt
too
hard
on
this
one
fact
if
i
were
dwight
schrute
theres
no
doubt
that
i
would
love
this
beer
fact
i
am
not
dwight
schrute
because
of
this
i
find
myself
somewhat
at
odds
with
this
beer
i
dont
really
know
what
to
make
of
it
the
aroma
is
downright
disgusting
the
taste
is
strange
with
hops
and
malt
hinting
at
the
start
but
beets
taking
over
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
what
would
otherwise
be
an
interesting
albeit
wacko
diversion
okay
so
this
thing
is
about
as
strange
as
they
come
but
i
admittedly
dont
have
much
experience
with
fruit
or
vegetable
brews
maybe
thats
why
i
like
this
thing
they
should
have
called
it
that
hooky
thing
because
its
like
that
pop
song
you
wont
admit
is
a
guilty
pleasure
of
yours
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
thin
lacing
of
head
that
disappears
quickly
smell
is
sweet
and
yeasty
taste
is
an
odd
blend
of
malt
and
beets
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
very
end
the
beets
hang
on
in
the
aftertaste
the
beet
flavor
actually
is
as
well
blended
into
this
beer
as
beets
could
possibly
be
light
to
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
the
beets
kudos
to
magic
hat
for
trying
something
unique
but
the
risk
you
run
is
that
oftentimes
it
flops
this
was
one
of
those
as
a
summer
beer
its
suitably
refreshing
but
it
could
be
more
flavorful
for
this
summer
it
would
be
great
if
it
came
with
a
frozen
glass
or
person
with
a
giant
fanshaped
leaf
or
winter
a
peculiar
rosy
amber
color
with
a
weak
slightly
pink
scattered
head
that
spreads
to
the
edges
after
a
few
minutes
and
little
or
no
traces
of
laces
the
aroma
is
a
peculiar
mineralmintyevergreen
and
bubblegum
just
hard
to
describe
not
immediately
alluring
but
okay
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
brings
in
more
evidence
of
malt
and
maybe
even
what
i
might
call
a
hint
of
clove
and
sweet
grass
hop
theres
a
dry
bite
to
it
at
the
front
it
has
quite
a
bit
going
on
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
an
odd
sort
of
lager
thats
a
little
too
bubblegum
sweet
for
my
tastes
in
this
sort
of
style
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
tiny
bubbled
fizziness
in
feel
refreshing
an
alright
summer
beer
drinkable
enough
but
not
something
i
will
rush
back
for
overall
wacko
has
a
really
good
taste
to
it
very
refreshing
on
a
summer
afternoon
i
wouldnt
drink
this
regularly
all
year
long
but
i
can
see
myself
getting
more
of
this
next
summer
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
definate
smell
carmel
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
beets
taste
pretty
much
the
same
alot
of
caramel
and
chocolate
to
my
palate
but
thats
alrighta
hint
of
beets
that
inst
my
favorite
i
think
they
taste
like
dirt
pretty
thick
for
a
summer
for
me
not
really
what
im
interested
in
when
i
think
of
a
summer
seasonal
i
would
enjoy
this
much
more
in
the
winter
of
late
fall
all
in
all
pretty
solid
just
not
for
the
summer
this
beer
is
bright
red
in
color
which
is
concerning
off
the
bat
it
is
colored
with
beets
and
you
can
certainly
taste
the
sugar
right
off
the
bat
and
it
follows
through
the
whole
beer
experience
which
is
a
bit
much
even
for
someone
who
likes
a
sweeter
beer
first
taste
impression
is
sweet
followed
a
feel
of
having
a
sugary
drink
in
your
mouth
and
then
leaves
you
with
an
aftertaste
of
sugar
had
it
both
in
bottles
and
on
tap
on
tap
was
at
least
a
bit
better
as
it
seemed
to
balance
the
sweetness
a
little
more
throughout
but
still
was
a
bit
much
would
be
good
to
those
who
like
a
super
sweet
summer
beer
o
i
am
never
ever
pouring
one
of
these
out
of
the
bottle
ever
again
how
does
a
beer
that
looks
like
meat
juice
and
smells
like
raw
vegetables
taste
this
good
a
beer
with
a
wonderful
personality
but
it
looks
like
steve
buscemi
overall
well
i
covered
that
in
flavor
not
one
ill
be
looking
for
again
not
my
favorite
but
at
least
is
a
different
summer
brew
overall
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
i
like
that
it
is
something
different
o
id
say
that
its
an
average
fruit
beer
that
needs
to
be
drank
cold
almost
like
almost
all
aals
if
you
want
any
decency
out
of
them
if
its
not
cold
this
becomes
a
nasty
drink
that
can
be
hard
to
down
as
long
as
its
in
a
cooler
this
is
an
easydrinking
summer
beer
i
should
note
that
this
beer
is
not
currently
on
the
top
50
fruit
vegetable
beer
list
on
beeradvocate
and
for
good
reason
this
beer
taste
like
shit
it
is
a
drain
pour
for
sure
harsh
and
bitter
sweet
and
a
horrible
lingering
grainy
aftertaste
this
beer
kick
me
in
the
nuts
beat
up
my
wife
aborted
my
child
and
asked
me
is
this
your
dog
before
kicking
her
and
leaving
the
front
door
open
upon
its
exit
to
waste
the
air
conditioning
this
is
a
disaster
of
a
beer
beware
avoid
avoid
avoid
overall
i
tried
it
once
and
that
is
enough
overall
unique
flavor
and
aroma
though
this
beer
itself
feels
like
carbonated
water
with
flavoring
not
terrible
in
fact
unique
in
itself
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
the
color
is
beautiful
but
the
gimmick
of
beet
juice
is
its
hook
and
there
isnt
anything
to
keep
me
there
this
tasting
resulted
in
a
drain
pour
of
about
the
last
3
inches
of
the
pint
sad
i
know
but
life
is
short
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
just
as
the
name
suggests
wacky
i
assume
that
the
color
of
the
beer
and
to
a
degree
some
of
the
taste
has
to
be
attributed
to
beats
or
beat
sugar
whatever
this
flavor
is
ill
call
it
beats
and
some
sort
of
funky
yeast
taste
comes
through
overall
i
dont
like
this
beer
it
s
to
wacko
for
me
i
guess
someone
likes
it
this
beer
poured
a
light
rose
color
clear
offered
little
head
scent
was
undetectable
taste
was
minimum
im
not
sure
what
magic
hat
was
going
for
here
it
does
not
have
an
offputting
taste
just
not
one
that
is
well
tasty
mouthfeel
was
eh
overall
not
my
choice
i
got
a
growler
of
this
at
whole
foods
where
it
was
listed
as
an
amber
ale
certainly
not
a
great
characterization
again
an
average
beer
magic
hat
house
flavor
but
not
great
o
swing
and
a
miss
not
worth
the
money
or
the
time
strange
bright
red
color
some
head
with
poor
retention
minimal
lacing
after
ten
minutes
this
stuff
looks
like
cherry
koolaid
wheat
and
fruit
juice
aroma
odd
flavor
has
a
weird
sweetness
from
the
beet
sugar
i
dont
know
why
they
would
add
that
to
a
beer
mediumbodied
with
adequate
carbonation
this
stuff
is
definitely
innovative
however
in
this
case
im
not
so
sure
its
a
good
thing
o
not
really
impressive
at
all
below
average
cheap
feeling
beer
with
no
lasting
impression
on
scent
taste
or
mouthfeel
color
is
cool
beet
juice
added
but
is
more
of
a
gimick
i
like
9
by
magic
hat
but
they
missed
on
this
one
o
i
was
expecting
something
interesting
if
a
guy
who
brews
beer
for
a
living
is
drinking
this
but
no
really
the
most
bland
beer
ive
ever
had
just
pink
fizzy
water
with
a
little
sugar
oh
wait
thats
diet
soda
this
is
my
2nd
magic
hat
beer
and
so
far
they
are
0
for
2
this
beer
is
a
subtle
beer
and
i
could
tell
they
didnt
want
to
go
overboard
on
the
beet
taste
so
that
it
wouldnt
maybe
turn
people
off
when
they
tasted
it
yeah
its
a
safe
beer
for
such
an
outlandish
one
and
i
think
this
is
what
peoples
main
problem
with
it
is
they
are
expecting
this
unique
knock
your
socks
off
dare
i
say
off
centered
ale
but
instead
get
a
very
subtle
flavoring
profile
which
i
think
when
recognized
is
pretty
damn
good
this
is
a
really
good
sessionable
beer
as
well
as
its
light
in
the
mouth
and
alcohol
is
it
the
best
summer
beer
no
but
is
it
worth
getting
a
six
pack
of
this
summer
id
say
so
overall
impression
besides
the
awesome
artwork
on
the
front
this
beer
is
only
appealing
by
the
label
and
name
not
even
a
beer
in
my
book
more
like
a
malt
beverage
with
a
pink
colored
body
i
was
hoping
to
have
a
great
beer
from
magic
hat
with
the
cool
body
but
seems
its
just
for
show
pretty
tasteless
and
the
pink
color
seems
like
a
gimmick
overall
i
am
not
impressed
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
poured
with
almost
no
head
a
blood
orange
slightly
pink
color
very
interesting
smells
of
wheat
and
a
sweet
tartness
the
taste
is
has
a
tangy
bite
upfront
followed
by
a
light
wheat
body
a
crisp
finish
that
retains
that
tangy
slightly
sour
flavor
a
little
too
sweet
this
same
sweet
yeast
or
whatever
it
is
many
of
these
beers
taste
sorta
like
glade
overall
i
like
this
beer
because
i
dont
care
for
hoppy
aftertaste
never
had
a
beer
with
a
beet
undertone
so
i
proceeded
with
caution
will
buy
again
if
simply
because
i
like
it
plus
its
a
conversation
starter
d
not
overtly
bad
sweet
and
sugary
beets
is
the
main
flavor
with
some
light
beer
flavor
in
the
background
it
does
what
it
sets
out
to
do
but
not
something
i
would
probably
look
out
to
buy
o
glad
i
put
these
all
out
at
my
memorial
day
bbq
so
i
didnt
have
to
drink
too
many
of
them
as
far
as
summer
seasonal
goes
it
is
light
and
crisp
but
its
weird
i
finished
it
trying
to
figure
it
out
the
whole
time
i
wouldnt
do
this
again
sorry
magic
hat
well
this
was
interesting
i
was
quite
startled
when
i
started
pouring
the
beer
and
noticed
a
pinkishredish
hue
as
with
all
magic
hat
beers
there
is
something
familiar
that
each
one
contains
this
beer
is
no
different
as
mentioned
above
it
pour
a
redish
color
there
isnt
much
smell
allergies
could
be
causing
an
issue
the
taste
is
decent
there
is
some
subtle
citrus
there
but
seemingly
a
solid
amber
the
lighted
abv
and
somewhat
fruity
taste
make
this
a
good
summer
beer
o
probably
no
definitely
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
magic
hat
save
your
and
enjoy
some
of
the
other
brews
by
mh
cheers
overall
nice
to
serve
the
nonbeer
drinkers
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
guess
this
would
be
an
alternative
to
a
wine
cooler
for
that
crowd
try
it
at
your
own
risk
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
but
definitely
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
like
this
pours
a
pretty
electricorange
i
guess
the
beet
juice
is
doing
its
job
smell
is
a
vague
lot
of
fruit
and
grass
taste
has
a
sweet
base
on
which
there
is
a
pleasant
freshness
and
persimmonlike
flavor
finish
is
almost
nonexistent
a
crisp
beer
for
sure
but
i
dont
see
the
point
in
a
beer
which
is
very
comparable
but
less
tasty
imo
to
their
9
id
rather
just
go
with
one
of
those
ehh
wasnt
horrible
but
wouldnt
try
it
again
when
i
initially
poured
this
into
my
pint
glass
i
thought
what
the
seriously
is
it
izze
i
expected
a
cloyingly
sweet
maltyness
w
the
extravagant
bubbles
and
effervescent
head
ala
carbonated
raspberry
lemonade
it
wasnt
it
was
a
very
dry
slightly
bitter
beer
with
a
clean
aftertaste
i
wont
put
this
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
fine
beers
but
i
like
the
look
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
was
good
for
a
nice
warm
nc
afternoon
try
it
if
you
want
something
different
overall
not
really
my
sort
of
thing
i
guess
but
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
nonetheless
if
youre
in
the
market
to
try
something
different
give
this
one
a
shot
it
did
seem
to
get
better
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
glass
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
d
fairly
drinkable
the
beet
flavor
is
an
interesting
addition
to
beer
but
the
beer
itself
is
empty
and
not
very
interesting
feels
very
off
balanced
and
empty
as
a
whole
ok
not
a
must
have
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
but
it
isnt
anything
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
to
try
again
id
buy
this
for
hot
summer
days
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
i
had
a
six
pack
while
grilling
out
and
then
moved
to
another
brew
so
maybe
a
good
simple
starter
is
a
better
way
to
put
it
overall
this
beer
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
even
for
the
style
it
wasnt
well
beery
enough
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
cross
between
a
pink
sparkling
wine
and
a
zima
i
definitely
would
not
try
it
again
o
good
for
the
evening
on
the
beach
liked
it
last
year
and
this
year
i
am
a
fan
of
what
magic
hat
has
does
i
like
their
sense
of
style
and
their
advertising
is
usually
very
hip
and
fun
to
look
at
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
wacko
went
it
came
out
and
knew
that
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
a
local
place
had
it
on
tap
and
i
ordered
one
up
without
any
hesitation
the
beer
came
to
me
as
a
clear
pinkish
hue
of
a
beer
interesting
kind
of
girlie
looking
but
ill
give
it
a
go
the
smell
was
on
the
weak
side
wasnt
really
able
to
pick
much
up
other
than
generic
beer
aromas
like
some
malts
and
grains
the
taste
was
very
light
as
well
kind
of
bumming
me
out
the
beer
itself
is
drinkable
i
expected
a
little
bit
more
of
a
flavor
or
something
just
fell
short
on
me
i
guess
i
still
enjoy
other
magic
hat
brews
though
ill
just
skip
this
one
unless
it
free
o
i
guess
i
just
didnt
get
this
beer
definitely
wont
be
having
it
again
or
see
what
the
appeal
is
i
also
dont
see
why
its
back
for
its
second
summer
overall
i
guess
im
just
not
impressed
and
i
was
so
excited
by
the
thought
of
making
beer
with
beet
juice
yes
these
people
are
thinking
like
homebrewers
i
was
thinking
but
this
is
a
beer
not
worth
spending
money
on
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
the
summer
season
unique
with
its
color
fresh
tasting
and
malts
have
character
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
to
knock
either
im
4
beers
in
to
a
session
and
i
decided
to
give
this
a
try
my
first
and
only
question
is
why
looks
like
childrens
cough
syrup
not
a
bad
thing
if
it
brought
something
else
to
the
party
no
distinct
smell
except
sweet
maybe
a
little
cherry
taste
is
better
than
the
nose
but
im
only
picking
up
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
bottom
line
im
not
sure
the
beet
brings
anything
to
the
beer
except
for
the
fact
that
mh
stakes
a
claim
on
doing
it
first
big
whoop
d
its
light
and
refreshing
but
not
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
by
any
means
maybe
if
its
really
really
really
hot
outside
overall
a
waste
of
drink
too
mild
nothing
worth
the
time
to
drink
and
certianly
nothing
much
to
enjoy
very
easy
to
drink
and
low
alcohol
but
other
then
that
needs
work
oh
my
where
to
start
the
worst
part
of
mh
wacko
is
the
nose
imagine
a
nice
fresh
bowl
of
hot
vomit
or
the
bottom
of
a
dirty
shoe
somewhere
in
between
perhaps
and
who
in
their
right
mind
decided
on
a
beer
with
beet
juice
color
didnt
we
all
decide
at
age
5
that
beets
tasted
like
dirt
this
beer
is
just
not
right
from
the
get
go
i
used
to
live
in
a
town
that
used
beet
juice
to
coat
the
roads
because
it
has
a
property
that
melts
ice
perhaps
we
should
just
pour
this
stuff
in
the
road
and
put
it
to
good
use
there
i
love
beer
all
beer
but
not
this
beer
on
second
thought
its
not
beer
i
think
we
should
rename
it
hot
barf
on
a
wednesday
night
while
i
am
a
magic
hat
fan
this
just
fell
flat
as
far
as
taste
if
i
was
blindfolded
this
is
as
close
to
an
american
lager
macrobrew
that
ive
seen
them
come
a
bit
strongly
carbonated
with
a
hint
of
vegetable
from
the
beets
and
some
sweetness
on
the
backside
but
other
than
that
its
quite
plain
usable
as
an
attentiongetting
session
beer
but
not
much
more
than
that
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddishpink
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
berries
with
a
hint
of
tangy
wheat
it
is
rather
mild
though
the
taste
is
very
neutral
there
isnt
much
going
on
at
all
there
is
some
fruit
but
it
is
hard
to
detect
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation
and
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
kinda
shocked
when
i
poured
a
glass
of
this
wacko
summer
seasonal
from
magic
hat
the
color
is
surprisingly
red
the
smell
is
mild
and
fruity
the
taste
is
fruity
as
well
its
not
as
fruity
as
a
lambic
this
is
deffinantly
a
beer
there
is
just
some
slight
fruitiness
in
the
background
thiis
isnt
a
great
rich
powerful
beer
but
i
do
think
it
does
what
it
sets
out
to
do
be
a
refreshing
summer
beer
that
you
cant
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
wont
be
seeking
this
again
i
hope
this
is
their
first
and
last
attempt
with
this
one
boring
it
has
a
little
more
taste
than
a
coors
light
that
obviously
aint
sayin
much
overall
this
be
is
very
average
and
i
probably
wouldnt
not
have
bought
this
beer
had
not
come
in
a
sample
pack
i
would
probably
not
buy
this
beer
again
im
not
sure
why
they
would
do
this
to
their
company
i
know
they
like
throwing
different
things
into
their
beers
but
this
one
is
a
bit
wacko
overall
a
brew
with
an
interesting
taste
and
a
decent
drinkability
although
the
fizzy
carbonation
may
have
been
just
a
tad
too
much
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
a
slightly
hazy
yelloworange
beet
juice
colored
i
mean
it
is
on
the
bottle
afterall
with
a
two
finger
pure
white
head
with
a
slight
pink
hue
going
on
to
a
minimal
amount
very
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
big
sweet
fruit
grape
juice
and
beets
juice
maybe
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
nutmeg
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
if
im
honest
it
was
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
it
smelled
granted
that
really
isnt
saying
much
just
way
to
bland
in
the
flavor
to
be
good
i
have
never
had
beet
juice
before
but
if
this
is
what
it
tastes
like
count
me
out
i
would
personally
only
suggest
this
to
someone
to
get
a
reaction
from
when
they
smell
it
just
not
very
good
at
all
drinkability
is
pass
on
this
one
magic
hat
has
better
beers
than
this
d
this
one
didnt
grab
me
so
i
didnt
seek
another
decent
pour
with
a
very
reddish
color
presumably
from
the
beets
for
a
fruit
beer
i
am
rather
impressed
as
im
not
typically
into
that
it
has
a
very
sweet
flavor
that
works
fairly
well
it
may
not
be
the
best
brew
i
have
gotten
from
magic
hat
but
was
at
least
a
nice
brew
to
try
it
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
i
did
not
want
to
drink
more
than
the
couple
of
sips
that
i
had
even
if
you
are
fan
of
fruit
beers
there
seems
to
be
nothing
special
about
this
one
d
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
impressive
kinda
dry
d
low
alcohol
makes
the
drinking
easy
although
from
a
taste
standpoint
not
sure
if
i
want
another
not
bad
just
more
run
of
the
mill
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
an
oragish
haze
colored
beer
with
a
slightly
off
colored
head
i
could
have
sworn
the
head
was
kinda
pink
maybe
it
was
the
lighting
the
taste
is
of
malt
and
some
yeast
character
their
site
says
they
only
use
pale
ale
malt
which
im
wondering
is
true
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
mellowed
out
sam
adams
summer
ale
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
the
mouthfeel
heavier
than
a
lager
but
lighter
than
a
brown
ale
low
medium
mouthfeel
i
guess
you
could
say
d
i
just
cant
really
get
into
this
beer
it
just
falls
short
on
too
many
levels
needless
to
this
isnt
one
to
seek
out
anytime
soon
drinkability
i
dont
really
get
this
beer
seems
that
they
took
and
average
macro
light
lager
and
added
beet
juice
to
make
it
pink
uh
okay
why
light
bodied
no
lack
of
carbonation
somewhat
watery
not
something
i
would
care
to
drink
again
this
pours
as
i
quote
a
christmas
story
it
looks
like
a
pink
nightmare
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
tangy
smell
and
the
taste
isnt
doing
anything
for
me
either

ok
i
appreciate
the
experimentation
i
really
do
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of

i
wont
say
the
experiment
failed
but
its
just
not
for
me
good
shot

easy

great

easy

i

i
could

many
more
of

but
its
an
interesting
experimental
brew
and
i
think
it
might
actually
pair
well
with
a
salad
i
cant
really
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
though
it
was
interesting
i
wouldnt
be
interested
in
having
another
one
fairly
meh
would
not
get
this
again
d
not
bad
at
all
it
goes
down
easy
enough
and
is
well
balanced
if
a
bit
vague
it
is
something
different
and
fun
to
take
to
a
bbq
but
i
was
expecting
something
more
interesting
something
a
bit
well
wackier
overall
i
really
cant
think
of
a
good
reason
to
buy
this
beer
im
sure
some
new
craft
beer
initiates
will
find
it
palatable
however
id
wager
that
itll
do
more
harm
than
good
as
far
as
turning
people
onto
craft
beer
pours
a
clear
redish
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
big
bubbly
white
head
minimal
retension
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
has
malt
sweetness
a
bit
of
hops
and
true
as
the
bottle
states
a
bit
of
a
beetearthy
note
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
has
a
bit
of
malt
and
low
hop
profile
unfamiliar
taste
that
is
minorly
earthy
rounding
out
the
finish
medium
amount
of
carb
and
feel
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
it
was
an
interesting
experience
but
one
was
enough
i
actually
drank
it
right
at
the
brewery
and
it
always
seems
to
taste
better
there
to
me
a
good
unique
looking
summer
beer
well
made
and
refreshing
the
beets
add
a
striking
red
color
but
not
much
else
after
all
beets
do
not
have
a
strong
flavor
there
is
light
maltiness
and
very
slight
fruitiness
no
hop
presence
beyond
just
enough
bitterness
that
the
beer
is
not
syrupy
should
be
drank
cold
by
the
gallon
in
august
drinkability
an
easy
going
novelty
beer
that
turns
into
a
summertime
favorite
ok
beer
but
wont
seek
it
oout
wow
is
all
i
can
say
and
not
in
a
good
way
drinkability
is
awful
this
beer
is
really
bad
i
very
rarely
ever
not
finish
a
beer
but
this
one
may
be
unfinishable
the
taste
is
so
off
and
bad
that
i
actually
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
avoid
notes
a
uniqueness
is
the
only
thing
going
for
it
other
than
beet
color
drinkability
initially
i
thought
this
brew
was
pretty
good
but
my
feelings
on
it
have
changed
a
little
its
pretty
weak
id
say
its
an
occasional
brew
drink
it
cold
overall
was
awesome
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
maybe
its
just
that
this
beer
is
rounding
out
its
life
best
by
date
was
sep
09
but
it
really
didnt
wow
me
this
time
one
thing
i
will
say
is
i
downed
this
one
pretty
quickly
so
i
could
1
get
a
different
beer
and
2
stop
holding
a
pink
beer
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
i
will
not
be
looking
for
it
again
a
good
summer
beer
it
looks
good
in
a
glass
smooth
and
satisfying
pours
a
reddish
pink
color
it
is
a
weird
color
like
a
strawberry
soda
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
smell
is
faint
though
the
taste
is
of
grain
backbone
and
a
wierd
bitter
middle
to
after
taste
the
after
taste
is
almost
like
a
cigarette
butt
could
be
the
beets
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
overall
its
isnt
very
drinkable
the
after
taste
is
a
little
much
its
a
different
idea
with
the
beets
but
the
taste
is
off
this
seems
like
a
red
summer
brew
poured
without
a
head
not
even
a
lacing
the
colour
is
quite
pretty
malty
nose
subdued
hop
bitewoodsy
taste
lacking
in
a
distinct
beer
flavour
clean
sweet
finish
all
those
combined
doesnt
make
a
great
taste
or
even
a
good
taste
the
only
thing
going
for
this
quaff
is
the
colour
wait
a
minute
did
i
just
buy
soda
this
is
barely
a
beer
at
all
it
pours
like
a
soda
very
fizzy
with
no
lingering
head
bubbles
continue
to
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
earthy
taste
is
very
light
and
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
i
could
see
drinking
this
on
a
hot
day
if
it
was
served
very
cold
an
interesting
beer
non
the
less
got
it
from
a
sampler
12
pack
dont
think
i
would
bother
picking
it
up
again
on
tap
at
the
new
champions
sports
bar
in
the
marriott
copley
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
neon
red
color
of
this
beer
odd
has
a
bit
of
an
earthy
smell
the
flavor
is
unique
to
say
the
least
kinda
sugary
kinda
fruity
and
kinda
bitter
all
at
the
same
time
the
sugar
aspect
gives
it
some
sweetness
but
i
think
the
beets
counteract
that
with
some
tartness
very
dry
aftertaste
i
wanted
to
try
this
beer
because
it
sounded
strange
so
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
an
unusual
experiment
from
magic
hat
it
was
worth
trying
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
could
not
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
drinkability
this
beer
is
smooth
enough
to
be
drinkable
but
too
bitter
to
be
refreshing
leaves
the
mouth
dry
plus
its
just
a
very
average
brew
serve
cold
this
is
the
only
way
youll
enjoy
it
spend
your
money
elsewhere
this
beers
only
gimmick
is
its
coloring
magic
hats
quirky
bottle
and
packaging
visuals
often
are
much
greater
then
the
beer
inside
them
is
wacko
isnt
as
wacky
as
magic
hat
would
like
to
believe
instead
its
yet
another
in
a
long
line
of
misses
from
a
brewery
that
has
the
talent
to
come
up
with
pretty
good
beer
when
they
want
to
while
i
dont
regret
buying
this
single
since
it
satisfied
my
curiosity
ill
be
glad
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
is
such
a
bland
beer
i
wonder
what
their
thought
was
mabey
this
was
a
bad
beer
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
9
and
this
one
just
reaffirms
my
dissatisfaction
with
magic
hat
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
anything
special
either
9
wasnt
bad
enough
candi
sugar
beet
sugar
and
toasty
malt
the
website
says
wacko
is
an
english
ale
but
its
crisp
and
toasty
and
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
weird
marzen
vegetalbe
soaked
water
aftertaste
its
not
terrible
but
its
not
really
good
either
im
not
sure
what
to
do
with
this
notes
i
wanted
really
to
like
this
beer
but
overall
it
just
didnt
have
much
to
offer
other
than
it
had
an
interesting
color
wacko
smells
like
a
light
beer
with
a
very
faint
smell
of
produce
the
variety
would
be
difficult
to
pinpoint
without
the
label
letting
us
know
that
it
is
a
beet
it
tastes
almost
like
nothing
very
light
faint
beet
little
alcohol
presence
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
is
just
so
faint
although
i
do
enjoy
their
9
and
other
selections
from
time
to
time
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
this
offering
from
magic
hat
anyway
not
much
to
talk
about
with
this
one
trying
to
go
into
this
with
an
open
mind
but
the
initial
appearance
and
aroma
are
not
helping
the
situation
pours
a
clear
redpink
color
with
a
large
frothy
pink
white
head
that
actually
has
nice
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
very
unappealing
to
me
very
earthy
and
musty
beets
obviously
i
dont
know
dirt
in
general
very
vegetable
like
and
grainy
not
necessarily
offensive
certainly
unique
just
not
appealing
to
me
smooth
medium
body
with
fairly
high
carbonation
flavor
follows
the
nose
very
earthy
and
vegetable
like
actually
taste
is
more
appealing
to
me
than
aroma
suggested
and
has
a
slight
hop
presence
in
finish
as
this
warms
up
i
start
to
get
a
little
more
of
a
a
sweet
mildly
fruit
like
presence
in
the
body
before
the
drier
slightly
unpleasant
vegetablebeet
finish
this
is
actually
kind
of
refreshing
and
not
as
awful
as
expected
however
for
my
own
taste
ill
be
skipping
this
in
the
future
the
mouth
was
crisp
and
bubbly
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
flavor
was
of
sweet
malts
some
vegetable
taste
and
finished
slightly
bitter
this
was
decent
much
better
than
i
expected
id
get
it
again
this
beer
is
not
a
drain
pour
but
i
dont
intend
to
repeat
the
experience
its
pretty
weird
in
a
bad
way
this
beer
poured
a
clear
light
pinishred
color
with
a
very
thin
14
inch
pink
head
to
it
head
doesnt
stick
around
and
doesnt
offer
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
nose
is
predominantly
of
malt
and
grain
with
a
slight
hidden
fruityness
to
the
nose
mixed
with
beet
taste
is
interesting
i
expected
more
of
a
beet
presence
to
it
what
i
found
was
the
malts
and
grains
were
the
dominant
force
in
the
taste
with
beet
flavoring
giving
it
a
kick
and
a
bite
to
the
end
of
it
light
bodied
low
to
medium
carbonation
goes
down
somewhat
easily
but
an
odd
afterbitetaste
to
it
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
one
was
enough
for
me
i
like
magic
hat
fruit
beers
beets
and
wild
experimentation
but
the
base
beer
on
which
this
experiment
was
conducted
is
boring
at
best
why
not
inject
gimmicky
beer
color
into
a
good
beer
has
a
intresting
pinkish
hue
to
it
along
with
good
head
and
laceing
has
a
slight
malt
smell
with
a
sweet
potato
ending
good
allaround
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
good
smooth
little
light
and
i
could
drink
these
for
hours
would
buy
agian
for
sure
good
for
a
hot
day
d
meh
light
and
refreshing
but
the
tastes
dont
blend
t
great
malt
taste
theres
a
nice
vegatable
taste
to
it
it
says
beats
on
the
lable
and
that
makes
sense
very
smooth
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
its
pretty
balanced
and
a
good
drinker
for
a
hot
night
nonoffensive
but
not
something
im
compelled
to
necessarily
go
back
to
and
visit
either
with
so
many
summer
offerings
wacko
stands
out
more
on
packaging
design
and
label
art
as
opposed
to
substance
i
wish
the
taste
was
as
edgy
and
artful
d
not
unpleasant
not
great
it
could
grow
on
you
but
i
dont
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
drinkability
the
foul
smell
ruins
an
otherwise
exciting
beer
upsettingly
i
bought
a
sixpack
but
i
doubt
i
could
finish
even
this
one
beer
cheers
magic
hat
definitely
gets
points
for
originality
as
it
does
provide
to
be
a
light
semirefreshing
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
would
i
run
to
the
store
and
buy
a
sixpack
of
these
no
thanks
three
is
enough
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
i
guess
but
i
just
cant
think
of
anything
particularly
commendable
about
it
to
base
a
recommendation
on
so
i
dont
recommend
as
beer
enthusiasts
we
often
establish
certain
prejudices
and
fail
to
realize
the
intent
of
a
brew
if
every
beer
was
a
trippel
we
wouldnt
be
having
as
much
fun
would
we
im
not
here
to
tell
you
any
beer
is
good
or
bad
because
everyone
has
different
tastes
wacko
is
not
a
thick
beer
its
not
bitter
in
fact
its
very
sweet
barely
hopped
and
not
very
filling
the
sun
shining
through
its
red
color
is
beautiful
i
get
it
beers
can
be
black
so
why
not
red
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
much
higherquality
characteristics
but
to
say
this
is
a
lowquality
beer
would
undermine
magic
hats
intent
wacko
can
be
enjoyed
as
a
beer
of
choice
throughout
the
day
with
no
regard
to
its
richness
its
a
simple
summer
seasonal
nothing
more
i
was
disappointed
with
the
blandness
of
this
beer
magic
hat
makes
brews
that
i
quite
enjoy
or
quite
dislike
this
one
is
just
meh
the
beer
was
a
wild
pink
color
and
the
beer
had
a
great
big
white
puffy
rich
head
it
lasted
pretty
well
also
in
the
heat
the
lacing
was
great
the
taste
was
interesting
but
refreshing
and
clean
i
would
not
want
to
sit
and
drink
6
in
a
row
but
it
was
a
cool
brew
id
buy
it
again
i
guess
i
must
have
got
a
fresh
one
after
seeing
everybody

with
a
small

is
blandsweet

and
nothing
else
really
sugary
nasty
mess
i
was
right
to
be
afraid
of
this
beer
seriously
stay
away
from
this
one
d
a
little
too
thin
for
my
liking
not
alot
of
flavor
or
smell
not
my
favorite
from
the
sampler
pack
d
not
tasty
in
any
way
does
not
go
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
i
just
did
not
find
anything
good
about
this
beer
and
theres
no
way
that
i
would
drink
it
again
d
drinkable
after
you
have
a
few
but
the
first
sip
tells
you
that
you
dont
want
anymore
d
drinks
like
water
very
lacking
in
flavorsmell
but
not
at
all
bad
just
boring
against
my
better
judgment
i
picked
this
beer
up
i
was
already
not
a
fan
of
mh
beers
this
further
reinforced
that
opinion
d
not
something
i
want
to
have
again
difficult
to
drink
when
you
cannot
stomach
the
taste
of
the
main
ingredient
drinkability
while
this
beer
is
not
horrible
i
feel
there
are
better
more
flavorful
fruit
beers
out
there
good
to
try
i
dont
feel
its
so
good
to
keep
d
i
always
try
to
give
magic
hat
offerings
a
fair
shot
and
they
never
impress
me
i
would
not
want
to
drink
this
after
a
12
hour
day
on
a
chain
gang
down
south
although
thats
not
allowed
anyway
again
wacko
is
wack
and
magic
hat
needs
to
try
harder
or
take
this
off
of
their
seasonal
releases
forever
i
foresee
a
ton
of
this
not
being
consumed
and
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
d
it
is
drinkable
enough
i
could
see
this
being
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
there
is
just
not
enough
there
for
me
to
really
want
to
drink
many
of
these
on
a
hot
day
its
not
unwelcome
it
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
summer
beer
youre
better
off
with
just
a
good
heffe
or
pils
feels
verrrry
light
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
so
nice
with
a
meal
for
me
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
on
a
nice
day
lives
up
to
its
name
but
it
turns
out
thats
not
such
a
good
thing
d
a
decent
beer
that
does
down
alright
im
just
not
blown
away
this
is
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
d
not
enough
flavor
to
be
that
drinkable
but
still
easy
to
put
down
because
of
the
light
body
overall
an
interesting
summer
beer
but
not
one
id
likely
seek
out
again
this
beer
brewed
with
beet
sugar
is
a
distinctive
pinkish
color
with
amber
hues
the
head
is
white
and
fairly
stable
its
a
good
looking
beer
the
smell
is
a
little
fruity
strawberries
and
pear
along
with
a
mustiness
theres
not
a
lot
else
in
the
aroma
which
is
not
really
engaging
the
taste
is
moderately
dry
but
has
a
lot
more
sweetness
than
i
expected
when
learning
about
the
beet
sugar
i
had
anticipated
bone
dryness
and
this
doesnt
even
approach
that
level
still
its
not
a
sweet
beer
some
malt
and
fruit
come
through
in
the
flavor
berries
again
the
finish
is
crisp
and
there
is
a
solid
hop
presence
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
not
one
that
really
excites
me
not
overly
impressive
but
still
rather
refreshing
a
light
summery
beer
the
fruit
taste
is
so
minimal
that
it
leaves
me
wondering
why
beats
what
gives
if
you
are
looking
for
a
fruit
beer
there
are
better
options
out
there
if
you
are
looking
for
a
summer
beer
ditto
but
it
is
worth
picking
up
and
trying
it
out
the
hype
for
magic
hatss
wacko
was
less
then
acceptable
i
have
come
to
learn
and
love
magic
hats
variety
of
different
fruit
flavors
was
such
a
let
down
other
then
the
pink
color
wacko
was
nothing
more
then
coors
light
with
red
food
coloring
im
so
happy
i
bought
it
in
a
twelve
variety
pack
because
i
would
hate
to
have
to
force
down
the
other
tastless
seven
ultimately
wacko
is
an
ok
summertime
refresher
fans
of
purple
haze
with
find
comfort
with
this
beer
i
really
expect
more
quality
from
magic
hat
d
this
one
is
worth
a
try
probably
just
once
unless
fruit
beers
are
your
thing
sour
flavor
that
is
over
the
top
surprisingly
short
near
nonexistent
aftertaste
quite
the
novelty
thin
bodied
highly
carbonated
a
clear
miss
drinks
very
well
but
i
have
to
think
that
is
expected
of
a
4
5
of
this
style
d
if
you
can
get
beyond
the
lackluster
taste
you
could
polish
2
or
3
of
these
without
trying
low
abv
to
boot
not
really
much
of
a
beer
though
this
beer
was
a
bit
offputting
at
first
but
i
have
grown
to
like
it
it
is
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
reminiscent
of
a
cocktail
it
has
bitter
and
vegetal
aspects
as
well
as
sweet
and
fizzy
notes
all
in
all
way
better
than
the
odd
notion
also
in
the
summer
variety
pack
md
light
and
crisp
about
the
only
goodt
hing
going
here
the
taste
is
just
not
good
and
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
drain
pours
i
have
ever
had
on
a
hot
day
the
keg
version
is
much
more
flavorful
not
my
thing
a
bit
sweet
though
not
overly
not
much
to
it
a
carbonated
sweetish
pinkishred
drink
odd
fruit
beer
if
you
like
beets
you
may
like
this
brew
i
tried
a
couple
more
to
see
if
i
could
acquire
a
taste
it
didnt
happen
cheers
as
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
i
noticed
definite
red
tint
to
it
it
looks
like
cherry
7up
the
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
strawberry
component
the
taste
is
very
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
light
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
actually
isnt
too
watery
the
beer
is
unremarkable
but
would
be
ok
after
mowing
the
yard
or
a
round
of
golf

however
the
taste
seems
a

off

me
it
tastes
like
sweet

and
a
weird
unnatural
sickeningly
sweet
flavor
that
im
not

what
it
is
i
assume
its
from
the

but
i
dont

for

i
just

i
dont

then
i

so
that

im
lucky
i
just
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
i
couldnt
imagine
having
to
drink
any
more
bottles
of
this
than
one
unfortunately
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
i
think
of
most
but
not
all
magic
hat
products
this
is
just
another
brew
that
is
more
gimmick
than
substance
i
know
magic
hat
is
capable
of
making
good
beer
like
roxy
rolles
and
hipa
i
just
wish
theyd
focus
more
on
making
decent
beer
than
stuff
like
this
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
tad
underrated
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
drinkable
and
is
better
than
the
runofthemill
macro
lager
i
actually
like
this
more
than
some
micro
brewed
lagers
like
bells

you
are

the
mood

refreshing

beer
this
fits
the
bill

the
drinkability
here
is
off
the
charts
id
say
while
the
beer
isnt
likely
to
please
those
who
are
looking
for
an
ultracomplex
beer
this
style
isnt
really
supposed
to
be
that
way
for
a

this
is
definitely
a
top
choice
d
ok
drinkability

a

that

i
have
never
seen
a
beer
pour
the
color
of
pink
before
but
that
is
just
what
this
one
did
pretty
bizarre
or
whacko
like
the
name
implies
must
be
that
beet
sugar
that
is
really
the
only
aroma
i
get
is
a
faint
scent
of
sugars
or
hops
but
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
thin
and
watery
the
taste
was
also
on
the
bland
side
and
maybe
a
little
tart
the
only
unique
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
color

plus
beet
sugar
this
poured
a
clear
strange
pinkish
peach
color
with
white
head
it
smelled
mostly
of
bready
yeast
with
some
apple
and
copper
hops
and
a
bit
of
barley
its
taste
was
dominated
by
bready
yeast
and
earthy
wheat
and
barley
with
a
bit
of
copper
and
apple
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
metallic
and
wheat
aftertaste
overall
this
was
not
nearly
as
flavorful
or
unique
as
i
hoped
the
ingredients
all
tasted
lowgrade
leading
to
a
dirty
and
bland
flavor
this
also
had
a
weak
body
and
low
abv
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
but
its
difficult
to
justify
drinking
the
only
interesting
aspect
about
this
drink
was
the
strange
color
and
im
not
sure
that
was
a
good
thing
you
can
skip
this
beer
why
are
summer
seasonals
so
much
worse
than
winter
d
this
brew
was
interesting
but
the
pink
body
is
the
only
thing
that
really
makes
it
memorable
good
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
version
of
craft
beer
refreshing
summer
brew
this
is
an
odd
looking
beer
it
poured
bright
pink
with
a
little
head
the
smell
was
pretty
basic
american
macrolager
i
wasnt
able
to
detect
any
beet
if
it
was
supposed
to
add
to
flavor
as
well
as
color
taste
is
more
of
the
same
some
sweetness
up
front
with
no
hops
to
balance
it
out
i
could
be
drinking
budweiser
with
some
food
coloring
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
with
some
crisp
carbonation
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
most
american
macros
so
at
least
it
has
that
going
for
it
a
very
underwhelming
brew
very
disappointed
with
this
latest
magic
hat
release
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
anything
from
their
brewery
but
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
poured
into
a
clear
mug
the
color
was
interesting
enough
rose
colored
reminded
me
of
the
cherry
ginger
ale
that
canada
dry
used
to
make
anyhow
the
color
was
interesting
enough
to
start
several
conversations
about
different
beers
the
taste
was
another
thing
i
think
the
beets
played
tricks
with
my
mind
as
i
expected
one
thing
a
got
something
completely
different
i
cant
say
anything
else
other
than
i
couldnt
finish
it
and
had
to
toss
it
out
thank
goodness
i
was
at
a
party
that
i
could
leave
the
rest
of
the
bottles
behind
boo
hiss
magic
hat
this
beer
had
quite
a
peculiar
smell
maybe
it
was
the
beets
very
surprised
by
the
color
when
pouring
it
into
a
glass
was
worried
that
the
beer
was
skunked
from
the
initial
smell
but
figured
since
this
is
the
new
seasonal
that
was
unlikely
nonetheless
it
was
far
from
good
in
fact
i
hope
to
pawn
off
the
remaining
bottles
on
unsuspecting
friends
disappointing
coming
from
magic
hat
who
seems
to
be
normal
good
beer
certainly
a
nice
break
from
my
recent
personal
streak
of
bigass
syrupy
andor
ultrahoppy
ales
but
generally
im
thinking
this
is
pretty
runofthemill
nosurprises
stuff
maybe
the
color
is
a
bit
wild
but
the
beet
juice
doesnt
come
through
strongly
enough
in
the
flavor
and
a
kick
in
the
butt
like
that
wouldve
helped
this
beer
attain
something
more
than
averageness
its
okay
certainly
worth
trying
once
but
hardly
wacko
d
not
an
undrinkable
brew
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
half
the
price
i
could
just
get
labatts
or
something
comparable
that
is
thirst
quenching
the
only
slightly
redeeming
factor
about
this
beer
is
the
pretty
shade
of
pinkish
red
that
is
its
hue
i
am
truly
disappointed
in
magic
hat
for
putting
out
this
macro
type
of
swill
the
mouth
feel
is
average
the
aroma
is
less
than
appealing
and
the
taste
is
well
insipid
perhaps
a
heartier
does
of
hops
could
have
saved
this
brew
but
then
again
that
would
have
reduced
the
profit
margin
on
this
one
lesson
learned
dont
send
the
wife
to
the
package
store
with
less
than
specific
instructions
on
which
beer
to
purchase
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
thick
white
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
cherry
flavor
is
fairly
malty
and
has
a
subtle
hoppy
undertone
as
well
as
a
firm
hint
of
cherry
and
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
lively
and
tingly
pours
a
pretty
pinkish
amber
with
a
nice
sized
and
persistent
head
aroma
is
faint
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
an
interesting
note
that
must
be
the
beets
but
it
comes
of
as
kind
of
a
weak
rounded
apple
flavor
mellow
and
balanced
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
for
a
summer
beer
this
actually
pretty
good
and
enjoyable
tap
handle
is
100
times
better
than
the
beer
seriously
if
i
didnt
have
to
write
250
characters
i
wouldnt
even
waste
my
time
giving
it
some
sort
of
a
review
besides
saying
awful
and
who
tasted
this
and
thought
it
was
a
great
idea
to
put
into
the
market
if
i
was
magic
hat
this
would
be
the
last
beer
id
want
a
new
to
magic
hat
drinker
to
try
a
never
before
magic
hater
would
probably
never
again
i
got
tricked
into
paying
for
good
marketing
and
poor
liquid
by
magic
hat
once
again
overall
wow
this
was
really
not
that
great
of
a
beer
and
to
be
honest
i
was
unsure
it
really
even
was
a
beer
not
something
i
plan
on
going
back
to
for
sure
meh
d
could
take
it
or
leave
it
honestly
lacked
any
wow
factor
at
any
point
and
overall
was
an
average
drink
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
snifter
a
crisp
ungodly
pinkish
red
with
a
thin
eggshell
head
aroma
is
slight
sweet
fruits
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
an
overly
sweet
abundance
of
malts
and
fruits
really
nothing
but
a
mess
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
but
the
overt
sweetness
blows
that
all
to
shit
this
is
certainly
one
ill
never
touch
again
with
a
ten
foot
pole
im
very
glad
i
just
bought
a
single
bottle
overall
this
beer
beer
isnt
too
bad
i
expected
the
worst
after
pouring
ontap
at
liberty
st
tavern
in
allentown
pa
appeared
red
with
a
short
offwhite
head
really
this
beer
only
gets
a
c
its
not
that
bad
just
a
simple
summer
beer
with
an
interesting
cherry
and
apple
flavor
from
beets
theres
also
a
spicy
malt
flavor
in
the
background
from
wheat
maybe
not
that
bad
in
my
opinion
if
you
want
to
try
a
sweet
and
simple
beer
thats
a
little
different
try
this
its
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
straight
from
the
bottle
otherwise
its
true
that
im
not
a
fruit
beer
fan
but
this
just
isnt
very
good
it
pours
amber
reddish
in
color
has
a
slight
head
and
is
completely
clear
carbonation
is
light
to
moderate
there
is
a
almost
berry
like
aroma
that
smells
sweet
and
fruity
the
taste
is
of
malt
fruit
alcohol
and
almost
hops
this
is
a
different
type
of
beer
that
i
think
lives
up
to
its
name
not
nearly
as
wacky
as
the
label
would
have
you
think
overall
a
light
and
refreshing
ale
and
actually
quite
boring
at
that
little
more
than
a
novelty
i
do
not
see
myself
ever
buying
this
beer
again
no
way
so
a
beer
with
beet
color
im
not
going
to
lie
this
looked
like
cherry
7up
when
i
poured
it
nice
and
fizzy
scent
is
fairly
remniscent
of
an
amber
aleamerican
macro
sweet
somewhat
fruity
smell
dry
taste
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
thin
mouthfeel
an
interesting
beer
the
taste
was
hard
to
place
but
pretty
awful
pretty
sure
i
would
not
buy
this
again
the
feel
is
lagery
for
lack
of
a
better
word
smooth
enough
but
watery
this
one
is
a
real
disappointment
a
typical
macro
lager
in
sheeps
clothing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodies
fizzy
and
sugary
an
odd
but
interesting
choice
for
a
summer
seasonal
release
i
wish
id
read
some
reviews
as
id
have
stuck
with
one
bottle
and
not
six
probably
the
first
time
magic
hat
has
genuinely
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
d
it
isnt
awful
its
definitely
an
oddball
but
as
cubedoggy
said
i
dont
think
it
deserves
such
harsh
criticism
its
certainly
light
enough
to
be
withincontext
for
summer
the
overall
flavor
and
mouthfeel
would
make
it
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
extra
weirdness
in
the
flavor
sort
of
takes
away
from
it
fail
drinkability
not
recommended
ive
had
some
great
beet
dishes
in
my
time
now
i
suppose
ive
had
one
iffy
beetbased
beer
this
is
a
oneoff
release
right
right
poured
a
very
red
color
nice
gimmick
but
i
know
beet
sugar
wont
do
all
of
that
decent
head
but
almost
no
lacing
very
odd
and
weak
scent
hints
of
hop
malt
and
veggie
all
competing
but
none
of
them
are
strong
at
all
decent
taste
probably
would
have
been
a
nice
pale
without
the
addition
of
the
beet
sugar
which
really
blanded
everything
out
goes
down
fine
d
i
guess
i
was
a
little
disappointed
its
not
bad
but
maybe
i
wanted
something
different
other
than
the
color
it
taste
like
a
lager
a
decent
lager
not
what
i
wanted
in
a
summer
beer
at
least
today
notes
this
did
not
work
for
me
as
i
could
not
get
past
the
flavor
not
the
worst
of
summer
beer
just
not
my
ideal
summer
seasonal
d
i
dont
know
im
an
hophead
and
a
homebrewer
and
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
summer
brew
im
not
sure
why
theres
such
disgust
and
vitriol
in
the
other
reviews
ive
bought
it
3
times
already
while
here
on
business
in
boston
and
my
wife
has
some
waiting
for
me
when
i
get
back
to
maryland
on
the
upside
i
took
one
of
these
beers
out
of
the
running
consider
this
a
bullet
dodged
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
your
welcome
not
much
more
i
can
say
i
will
go
back
to
9
d
nil
slick
and
watery
mouthfeel
slight
tingle
in
the
finish
low
drinkability
im
not
enjoying
this
one
seems
like
its
perhaps
a
light
summer
drink
made
to
compete
with
malternatives
this
is
a
very
disappointing
brew
from
magic
hat
their
worst
brew
by
far
i
was
totally
misguided
on
this
one
can
not
even
recommend
it
for
more
then
a
few
this
brew
would
be
good
for
a
very
hot
day
or
maybe
pairing
it
up
with
a
meal
and
you
want
an
alternate
to
soda
drinkability
is
not
bad
especially
as
a
lawnmower
beer
this
one
is
right
on
the
edge
whether
it
deserves
a
glass
or
just
a
swill
out
of
the
bottle
i
bought
2
in
a
mixed
six
pack
i
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
with
so
many
better
summer
beers
around
a
bit
of
on
odd
beer
but
not
terrible
redish
pinkish
color
and
perfectly
clear
nearly
white
pinkish
head
that
goes
away
modertly
fast
no
lacing
an
odd
taste
its
a
mediocre
taste
right
off
the
bat
and
then
you
taste
the
fruity
sweetness
of
it
other
than
the
fruity
sweetness
apparently
from
beets
which
explains
the
color
there
is
really
nothing
else
interesting
about
this
beer
not
bad
but
not
too
great
recommended
for
a
pot
luck
tasting
and
nothing
more
light
bodied
possibly
a
little
overcarbonated
i
suppose
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
down
but
it
jusnt
taste
good
enough
to
me
to
even
finish
the
glass
this
is
a
interesting
addition
to
the
magic
hat
faily
of
beers
d
dont
know
what
to
say
here
i
guess
im
glad
i
tried
it
so
i
know
for
the
next
time
magic
hat
came
up
a
little
short
on
this
one
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
lost
cause
i
hoped
to
never
cross
paths
with
any
beer
of
this
level
of
shit
it
has
created
a
new
plateau
of
piss
poor
brewing
efforts
why
does
it
have
to
come
from
a
likeable
brewery
like
magic
hat
and
have
such
a
cool
fuckin
label
a
sixer
on
a
whim
and
cause
it
was
cheap
a
friend
and
i
split
them
and
neither
of
us
was
particularly
impressed
this
one
poured
a
strange
bright
maroon
color
with
touch
of
quickly
vanishing
head
nose
wasnt
terrible
sweet
maltiness
some
very
light
unidentifiable
fruit
not
a
lot
going
on
there
maybe
a
touch
of
yeast
flavors
fairly
similar
just
nothing
really
to
hold
on
to
and
i
might
not
have
known
it
was
a
fruit
beer
without
seeing
its
strange
appearance
a
hint
of
malt
some
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
hint
of
hops
feel
is
fine
appropriate
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
slightly
thin
body
overall
its
boring
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
i
know
this
was
just
a
taste
but
more
than
enough
in
my
opinion
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
seek
out
again
this
will
be
my
shortest
review
the
beer
is
pink
it
has
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
nose
it
has
no
flavor
my
wife
described
it
as
having
less
flavor
that
natty
light
i
have
to
agree
with
her
sad
very
sad
why
would
they
bottle
and
sell
this
a
sad
one
for
magic
hat
magic
hat
wacko
is
a
clear
sparkling
raspberrycolored
beer
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
pretty
good
lacing
the
color
surprised
me
it
has
a
yeasty
wheaty
aroma
with
a
note
of
citrus
peel
it
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
it
is
lightly
flavored
with
mostly
wheat
there
is
light
grassy
bitterness
to
it
this
is
chugging
beer
d
an
odd
beer
that
i
am
happy
that
i
have
tried
out
as
for
drinkability
i
think
i
could
only
take
a
few
at
a
time
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
full
6
pack
of
this
thing
and
got
it
instead
in
the
mixed
12
pack
still
very
mundane
ill
not
be
back
for
more
magic
hat
was
grasping
at
straws
again
for
a
kitschy
summer
brew
to
saturate
the
market
preemptive
for
an
odd
notion
perhaps
chicks
and
light
beer
drinkers
might
get
a
kick
out
of
the
sparkling
wine
look
but
the
flavor
is
ultimately
a
letdown
that
being
said
i
can
not
and
will
not
defend
this
abomination
to
beer
first
of
all
its
pink
and
that
to
me
just
seems
like
a
novelty
novelty
can
be
fun
if
the
product
is
also
good
this
beer
tastes
like
beet
flavored
seltzer
there
is
no
taste
its
just
a
really
bad
decision
magic
hat
however
is
known
for
being
experimental
and
when
you
take
risks
youre
sometimes
going
to
not
hit
the
mark
this
is
that
beer
d
a
total
gimmick
beer
if
this
was
yellow
no
one
would
pay
any
attention
to
it
i
normally
enjoy
magic
hats
odd
styles
but
this
one
really
falls
flat
its
not
terrible
but
thoroughly
average
taste
is
not
bad
fruity
but
not
overly
so
the
beer
strangely
works
for
me
if
you
get
past
the
color
the
beer
itself
is
refreshing
a
drinkable
worked
well
with
my
pulled
chicken
barbecue
12
ounce
bottles
comes
with
handy
freshness
dating
info
on
the
rear
label
pours
a
radical
shade
of
pinkish
reddiluted
beet
the
head
is
similarly
tinted
loose
and
fluffy
before
receding
to
a
thicker
film
and
leaving
copious
amounts
of
thick
lace
light
and
fruity
on
the
nose
not
my
favorite
style
this
one
is
the
expected
continuation
of
the
light
and
fruity
theme
hops
flex
their
muscles
mid
way
through
the
experience
hot
weather
summer
lunch
with
dessert
all
these
occasions
could
work
with
this
one
sorry
haters
i
dig
this
one
except
for
the
silly
color
and
gimmicky
nature
a
blind
taste
test
would
serve
this
brew
well
pours
a
clear
rose
color
with
a
wispy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
small
ring
something
very
unnatural
about
a
pink
beer
the
aroma
is
of
light
tart
fruit
perhaps
apricot
and
some
veggie
the
flavor
is
a
bit
grainy
little
metallic
and
sugary
brown
sugar
sweet
but
nowhere
near
cloying
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
fizzy
finishes
neutral
perhaps
a
touch
sweet
a
gimmicky
brew
flavors
are
ok
but
seems
to
have
identity
issues
pours
a
light
pink
color
very
off
putting
with
a
small
white
head
faint
pilsnerlike
nose
some
roasted
grain
a
dash
of
bitter
hops
no
adjuncts
light
on
the
palate
super
light
in
fact
dare
i
say
watery
almost
no
flavor
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
slight
bitterness
towards
the
finish
i
guess
it
does
its
job
well
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
is
all
this
beer
for
me
however
gets
looped
in
with
freaktoberfest
i
just
cant
take
it
seriously
it
plays
games
with
the
left
side
of
my
brain
every
time
i
look
down
at
the
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishpink
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
typical
golden
ale
scent
with
a
slight
fruityestery
aroma
i
guess
beet
juice
was
added
but
the
sugars
must
have
all
fermented
out
leaving
behind
just
the
color
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
thin
pale
malt
flavor
with
little
hop
character
and
a
dry
finish
i
detect
some
dry
fruity
taste
but
its
low
to
moderate
at
best
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
it
lacks
taste
and
real
beer
character
this
beer
is
why
you
should
look
at
reviews
before
purchasing
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
glass
into
my
sa
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
like
a
cranberry
7up
mix
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
i
do
not
want
my
beer
to
look
like
a
chicks
drink
the
aroma
is
very
faint
maybe
a
bit
musty
the
flavor
is
a
little
funky
with
a
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
i
guess
the
drinkability
is
ok
it
is
probably
better
at
a
bbq
with
food
to
hide
the
beers
lack
of
flavor
imo
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
from
a
craft
brewer
in
a
long
time
d
this
was
the
toughest
aspect
to
rate
i
say
that
the
wacko
is
drinkable
just
not
enjoyable
for
me
it
pours
alright
it
looks
fine
and
the
head
retention
is
decent
but
the
taste
is
quite
unexpected
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
if
you
like
beet
sugar
wacko
is
listed
as
a
summer
seasonal
at
the
liquor
store
with
no
hint
of
its
base
style
or
malthop
varieties
inside
its
astringent
and
i
detect
no
sour
element
to
the
beer
no
frutiness
from
the
ale
yeast
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
layers
in
the
pallette
magic
hat
has
some
good
beers
out
there
on
the
market
unfortunately
this
is
not
one
of
them
stay
clear
of
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
pink
color
with
a
matching
head
that
has
decent
retention
the
aroma
provides
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
some
off
notes
i
assume
the
beat
juice
the
taste
is
alright
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
and
sour
thing
going
and
a
dry
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
im
going
out
of
my
way
to
find
actually
somewhat
refreshing
i
guess
if
you
love
beets
this
one
will
sit
just
well
otherwise
its
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
thats
maybe
trying
a
little
to
hard
to
be
original
im
sure
there
are
some
fans
out
there
bought
as
part
of
their
summer
mixpack
unfortunately
i
dont
think
that
many
will
share
my
view
as
this
beer
will
be
viewed
as
a
procrustean
bed
traditional
apa
fans
will
spurn
its
general
lack
of
hops
while
summer
beer
fans
disappointed
that
magic
hat
has
not
created
another
circus
boy
will
wince
as
they
choke
back
a
six
pack
the
thought
of
this
drives
me
wacko
poured
a
medium
reddish
color
cherry
koolaid
with
a
smaller
sized
pinkish
head
one
wacko
looking
beer
aromas
of
vegetables
is
i
the
beets
and
some
grains
tastes
of
the
same
with
some
sugary
sweetness
this
one
was
definitely
different
d
an
alright
brew
not
too
impressed
but
to
each
his
own
so
what
do
i
say
gimmicky
perhaps
i
dont
think
that
the
beet
is
anything
special
but
on
the
other
hand
i
dont
think
that
marketing
something
like
this
is
bad
either
whatever
sells
right
and
lets
be
honest
cards
on
the
table
i
enjoyed
this
and
liked
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
tequiza
i
know
chicks
will
dig
it
and
hippie
guys
will
probably
love
it
too
so
what
the
hell
spread
the
love
md
decent
carbonation
but
the
flavor
is
just
off
to
me
i
had
one
and
now
im
good
pours
beat
redpink
with
not
much
head
and
no
lacing
the
color
is
interesting
but
it
in
no
way
resembles
a
beer
the
smell
is
very
light
with
a
small
whiff
of
hops
and
candied
sugar
the
taste
is
not
much
more
then
the
smell
there
is
nothing
offensive
and
the
flavors
that
i
can
pick
up
are
not
bad
in
anyway
but
it
has
as
much
flavor
as
a
bud
light
i
could
put
quite
a
few
of
these
away
easily
enough
because
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
dose
not
impress
me
at
all
how
can
magic
hat
replace
some
of
its
better
brews
with
this
didnt
know
what
to
expect
so
when
the
bartender
handed
my
ruby
redpinkish
draft
i
thought
he
mixed
my
brew
up
with
my
wifes
order
she
had
a
fraimboise
the
head
was
nonexistent
and
it
carbonated
like
cherry
7up
one
whiff
and
i
didnt
pick
up
much
except
some
faint
hops
and
some
minor
dark
fruit
notes
it
is
a
little
watery
and
slick
with
minor
hop
bitterness
and
dryness
in
there
along
with
some
floral
hop
notes
picked
up
some
sweet
malts
on
the
backend
for
a
decent
balancing
act
i
am
not
slamming
the
beer
by
its
color
and
magic
hat
usually
comes
up
with
good
beers
but
this
one
is
a
miss
pink
beer
what
next
looks
good
in
the
glass
held
the
head
well
and
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
smells
funky
and
metallic
malty
dry
taste
crisp
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
left
me
with
that
metallic
after
taste
that
i
didnt
care
for
so
its
not
something
i
would
buy
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
might
drink
again
but
only
if
it
was
summer
my
other
options
were
worse
and
maybe
there
was
a
pink
themed
party
going
on
thats
what
this
beer
was
made
for
a
pink
themed
party
with
a
bunch
of
your
macrodrinking
friends
for
that
it
would
get
an
a
the
color
caught
me
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
a
pinkish
reddish
color
that
looked
like
a
fruit
beer
it
had
a
pinkish
foamy
head
that
left
in
a
hurry
no
lacing
it
smelled
sweet
with
a
little
bread
mixed
in
there
you
could
taste
the
malt
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
with
a
dry
finish
you
can
not
taste
the
coloryou
know
what
i
mean
low
in
abv
so
drinkability
is
there
as
far
as
summer
beers
go
this
one
is
ok
i
liked
the
unusual
appearance
and
it
made
me
like
it
moremental
thing
cause
i
love
beets
give
it
a
whirl
with
an
open
mind
and
compare
it
to
other
summer
offerings
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
pink
with
a
fizzy
pink
white
head
this
is
one
very
different
beer
that
smells
quite
sweet
and
not
that
much
in
the
way
of
anything
else
except
for
some
pale
malts
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
the
sweetness
and
pale
malts
probably
my
least
favorite
out
of
the
summer
mix
the
color
is
a
bit
odd
a
pale
pinkish
to
me
it
looked
like
diet
soda
it
has
a
pleasant
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
kind
of
bland
its
not
offensive
or
over
powering
but
rather
lacking
any
real
lasting
flavor
once
again
with
the
taste
i
was
kind
of
reminded
of
diet
soda
d
meh
tastes
like
another
flavored
wheat
ale
for
the
most
part
interesting
for
a
few
sips
but
nothing
that
stands
out
a
unique
beer
they
named
it
correctly
but
nothing
special
here
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
this
anytime
soon
but
glad
i
tried
it
im
sorry
i
just
cant
get
my
head
around
a
beer
that
is
pink
this
beer
is
a
reddishpink
color
with
a
thin
pink
head
the
head
is
gone
in
seconds
it
has
a
nondescript
sweet
malt
aroma
some
improvement
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
more
hops
assertiveness
there
is
also
a
bit
of
bubblegum
in
the
taste
i
suppose
if
you
can
get
past
the
color
that
this
beer
would
be
a
good
session
beer
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
is
the
terminology
that
came
to
mind
with
this
beer
i
just
bought
to
try
it
out
didnt
know
about
the
beet
coloring
until
just
cracking
open
the
first
one
its
looks
like
a
raspberry
lambic
which
ive
tried
before
and
is
awful
but
it
taste
similar
to
a
summer
notion
beer
from
last
summer
it
had
a
nice
pinkish
head
that
never
quite
settled
to
me
it
tasted
like
a
piney
summer
beer
dont
let
the
color
trick
u
good
session
beer
for
the
summer
its
sure
is
a
head
turner
the
color
that
is
edit
grammar
corrections
hey
id
had
a
few
and
taste
taken
down
a
peg
now
that
ive
finished
it
off
this
tastes
like
one
of
those
mainstream
beer
that
craft
beer
consumer
rage
against
just
with
a
pretty
color
to
it
unfortunate
because
the
vibe
and
the
marketing
of
magic
hat
and
what
they
promote
is
fantastic
i
feel
really
bad
saying
this
but
it
is
about
the
beer
this
is
not
a
good
beer
as
far
as
flavor
and
quality
d
i
guess
you
could
drink
a
whole
12
of
these
if
you
wanted
to
but
for
me
theres
nothing
to
keep
me
wanting
to
drink
this
disappointment
perhaps
its
magic
hat
pandering
to
its
more
hipster
beer
drinking
crowd
instead
of
real
beer
drinkers
but
theyve
gone
down
a
notch
in
my
book
at
least
hipa
is
still
good
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
light
is
really
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
goes
down
well
drinkability
very
high
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
high
enough
to
be
reached
for
any
other
day
overall
too
watery
not
enough
hop
presence
to
make
this
a
worthwhile
apa
a
gimmick
because
of
the
beetjuice
coloring
okay
this
beer
is
just
silly
beetjuice
for
color
whats
the
point
this
came
in
a
mixed
12
summer
pack
so
i
drank
one
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
drainpour
but
it
doesnt
really
have
anything
to
recommend
it
either
pours
an
orangepinkishred
with
no
head
beyond
a
thin
ring
smells
vaguely
fruity
and
a
tad
dusty
tastes
light
fizzy
slightly
fruity
dusty
and
slightly
bitter
and
metallic
on
the
finish
pretty
blah
carbonated
and
slightly
bitter
and
artificial
in
the
mouth
the
beetjuice
does
nothing
for
this
beer
but
add
some
dusky
notes
and
an
artificial
color
and
there
isnt
much
else
there
either
ill
avoid
this
in
the
future
i
bought
a
six
of
this
even
after
reading
the
label
to
see
it
is
beet
red
in
color
which
makes
it
hard
to
take
serious
when
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
it
didnt
taste
absolutely
horrible
and
im
sure
people
that
dont
really
like
the
taste
of
strong
beer
will
like
it
people
who
like
wine
coolers
and
things
like
bud
light
would
probably
love
this
if
you
prefer
a
good
ale
porter
or
stout
or
fall
or
winter
beer
then
this
is
not
for
you
eventually
the
head
turns
white
and
the
beer
mellows
out
to
just
a
pinkish
read
not
much
there
aroma
wise
i
must
also
say
ive
never
tried
a
beet
before
so
im
not
sure
of
its
taste
but
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
nice
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
has
a
nice
fruity
sort
of
flavor
to
it
but
not
over
the
top
at
all
sort
of
like
9
just
with
beets
i
suppose
to
sum
it
up
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
light
bodied
and
good
i
dont
know
what
else
people
are
expecting
from
a
summer
beer
but
there
it
is
i
hope
to
see
this
beer
on
tap
this
summer
its
a
replacement
for
hocus
pocus
which
was
a
solid
good
brew
but
was
a
sam
adams
summerale
clone
so
i
think
i
prefer
them
doing
something
different
for
the
sake
of
variety
drinkability
i
dont
know
why
all
the
bashing
on
this
offering
sure
its
not
magic
hats
best
beer
but
its
a
fairly
decent
one
at
that
its
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
features
enough
elements
to
make
it
easily
better
then
alot
of
other
fruit
engulfed
beers
on
the
market
today
dont
know
if
id
get
another
6
pack
of
it
but
if
offered
i
would
easily
have
another
one
i
think
hocus
pocus
rocks
this
one
into
the
ground
even
with
its
limited
flavor
profile
way
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
a
couple
not
very
drinkable
for
the
session
beer
style
abv
the
taste
is
quite
nasty
what
were
they
thinking
this
tastes
like
really
lousy
ale
with
a
bunch
of
coloring
and
flavorings
added
the
underneath
is
a
dry
and
poorly
crafted
maltiness
and
on
top
is
just
some
awful
fruit
adjunct
the
beer
is
part
dry
part
sweet
none
too
refreshing
the
mustiness
just
lingers
all
the
way
through
what
a
disappointment
this
is
a
drain
pour
for
me
note
this
beer
could
work
in
getting
more
chicks
to
play
beer
pong
get
the
clear
plastic
keg
cups
avoid
this
trite
unrefreshing
beer
to
me
easily
the
worst
that
magic
hat
has
to
offer
a
poor
offering
that
ought
to
be
discontinued
forthwith
this
is
a
strange
beer
it
is
redish
pink
i
thought
i
have
seen
everything
until
i
poured
this
beer
the
appearance
is
cool
the
smell
is
like
a
slightly
sweet
beet
the
taste
is
not
bad
there
is
a
very
slight
hoppiness
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
too
this
beer
is
not
as
crisp
as
the
packaging
says
but
it
is
still
not
bad
in
the
mouth
as
for
drinkablity
this
beer
is
not
a
bad
beer
very
cold
and
i
could
see
the
refreshing
fator
on
a
warm
day
all
around
it
is
a
odd
but
solid
beer
and
i
will
buy
again
this
beer
is
weird
it
pours
with
no
head
and
little
carbonation
but
get
this
the
beer
is
pink
nose
is
a
little
bit
skunky
but
nothing
too
crazy
and
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
not
over
the
top
overall
this
beer
is
interesting
but
nothing
worth
buying
again
i
wouldnt
normally
recommend
this
beer
but
i
suppose
just
for
the
experience
it
might
be
worth
trying
as
long
as
you
dont
have
to
pay
for
it
might
as
well
have
drank
a
miller
light
and
put
some
food
coloring
in
it
poured
a
dull
pink
collor
with
excessive
carbonation
no
aroma
to
speak
of
tatsed
like
you
would
expect
a
bad
pilsner
to
taste
i
would
wright
more
but
the
opening
statement
pretty
much
sums
it
up
pink
colored
beer
with
a
light
pink
fluffy
head
that
fades
quick
and
leaves
some
splotchy
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
beets
otherwise
very
clean
tastes
very
light
and
crisp
faint
caramel
malt
and
toasted
grain
with
a
splash
of
beet
thrown
in
for
good
measure
light
and
effervescent
with
a
dry
finish
not
bad
but
not
great
either
the
bottle
i
have
says
4
5
abv
as
for
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
like
water
its
very
thin
but
might
actually
be
pretty
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
day
again
this
is
almost
like
drinking
water
you
could
down
a
couple
of
these
without
trouble
if
you
were
so
inclined
overall
an
interesting
beer
definitely
better
than
most
summer
ales
out
there
give
it
a
whirl
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
more
than
once
more
d
why
bother
it
just
tastes
like
a
light
lager
and
looks
fruity
but
doesnt
taste
like
any
fruit
was
used
in
it
i
could
say
it
is
drinkable
but
only
passable
really
i
would
prefer
some
taste
not
just
texture
and
a
colored
pale
beer
whatever
was
used
to
color
must
have
fermented
out
and
i
would
say
try
as
a
lawnmower
ale
if
you
see
it
cheaply
priced
the
fuschia
color
is
kind
of
queerwacko
notes
not
much
here
really
light
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
dry
tastes
an
awful
lot
like
single
chair
with
a
light
suggestion
of
red
fruit
overall
a
refreshing
ale
didnt
get
much
beet
however
not
a
bad
beer
would
probably
quench
your
thirst
in
the
summertime
not
much
else
to
write
about
and
too
similar
to
kerouac
except
that
the
carbonation
level
seems
higher
otherwise
worth
a
sample
if
not
a
full
growler
off
the
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
a
rebranded
slightly
tweaked
version
of
their
kerouac
a
beer
made
with
beets
was
a
winecoolerpink
color
the
onefinger
babypink
colored
head
did
not
retain
well
and
left
weak
lacing
consequently
the
aroma
was
rather
faint
a
blend
of
pale
malt
floral
hops
and
sugarbeets
the
flavors
started
dry
with
pale
malt
and
some
wheatlike
notes
followed
by
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
beets
and
hops
the
finish
was
semibitter
the
beets
again
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
generally
acidic
with
hints
of
tartness
like
an
augmented
hefeweizen
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
foamy
but
soft
the
carbonation
average
and
the
body
mediumlight
an
unusual
beer
to
be
certain
but
a
summery
one
and
worth
a
try
if
nothing
else
for
the
novelty

at
rattle

hum
nyc
on
tap
very
refreshing
the
hint
of
berry
is
a
nice
touch
light
bodied
wheat
with
a
balanced
flavor
we
could
become
good
friends
i
might
track
it
down
in
bottles
to
see
if
it
holds
its
smoothness
elder
betty
is
my
favorite
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
its
not
like
other
fruit
beers
where
you
think
youre
just
drinking
cider
theres
enough
of
an
aftertaste
that
reminds
you
that
its
beer
to
know
it
isnt
cider
and
its
not
overpowering
with
one
fruit
i
love
it
i
actually
like
this
more
than
i
probably
should
it
goes
down
wicked
easy
and
is
very
thirst
quenching
probably
better
for
a
hot
summer
day
where
i
could
pound
a
couple
of
these
like
nothing
overall
not
a
bad
summer
beer
it
is
pretty
sweet
i
would
have
it
again
notes
nice
berry
flavor
that
isnt
artificial
tasting
not
that
is
like
some
sours
with
tons
of
fruit
flavor
but
it
does
the
trick
good
balance
with
tartness
i
kept
being
reminded
of
blueberry
lemon
muffins

a

pie
of
some
kind
but
not
in
a
this
is
really
sweet
way
good
summer
beer
but
not
great
the
crack
showed
that
even
magic
hat
is
not
holding
back
when
it
comes
to
brimful
cans
knowing
now
why
many
of
them
do
it
i
am
curious
as
to
why
they
all
do
not
fill
their
cans
this
way
i
got
in
an
inverted
glug
and
then
sat
back
to
watch
as
the
pseudocascade
took
place
the
three
fingers
of
dense
rocky
yellowishwhite
head
was
like
meringue
atop
a
pie
i
kid
you
not
that
was
some
of
the
thickest
densest
head
that
i
have
encantered
in
a
long
time
it
took
forever
to
settle
also
color
was
a
cloudy
not
hazy
sorry

srm
5
pours

not

smells

only
a
little

not
much
exciting
about
this
beer
it
is
refreshing
but
does
not
go
enough
on
any
point
i
was
very
disappointed
overall
ok
brew
glad
i
tried
it
although
theyre
certainly
not
the
first
to
do
so
youve
got
to
give
magic
hat
at
least
a
little
bit
of
credit
for
originality
in
producing

the

daze
hahaha
smokers
cough
following
outside
of

the
american
yeast
used
in
the
beer
makes
the
wheat
component
pretty
lifeless
and
one
dimensional
on
draft
at
a
local
and
decided
to
try
glad
i
did
great
raspberry
smell
not
overbearing
raspberry
taste
a
little
sweet
but
overall
very
easy
to
drink
my
favorite
fruit
beer
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
raspberries
raspberry
color
along
with
light
hops
and
a
good
balance
of
grains
and
raspberry
flavor
make
this
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
aroma
of
tart
raspberry
juice
chemical
wheat
faint
breadiness
taste
koolaid
type
raspberry
grass
malt
synthetic
wine
cooler
not
crazy
about
the
raspberry
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
when
i
first
picked
up
a
6pack
on
a
trip
to
atlanta
i
was
extremely
pleased
with
my
purchase
this
is
just
a
darn
good
raspberry
hefeweizen
if
you
like
fruity
beers
this
would
be
a
great
one
for
you
to
try
great
taste
aroma
and
definitely
a
nice
smooth
drink
enjoy
overall
very
drinkable
and
accessible
would
recommend
for
a
nonbeer
drinker
o
this
is
a
great
raspberry
beer
the
sour
character
makes
this
really
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
might
be
an
awesome
complement
to
a
late
breakfast
or
even
brunch
or
for
a
lazy
saturday
afternoon
session
recommended
if
you
like
abita
purple
haze
this
blows
that
right
out
of
the
water
super
amazing
fresh
raspberry
smell
and
ending
flavor
not
too
sweet
still
tastes
like
a
beer
not
a
wine
cooler
i
am
a
big
fan
of
fruiting
the
beer
and
this
is
how
its
done
well
very
pleased
i
got
this
as
a
single
so
really
i
just
picked
it
up
for
the
raspberry
once
i
opened
it
i
took
a
second
look
at
the
bottle
and
realized
it
was
harpoon
no
wonder
its
amazing
final
verdict
buy
it
on
sale
i
dont
think
that
that
its
quite
worth
full
price
on
the
shelf
unless
your
looking
for
a
great
raspberry
beer
to
break
a
newbie
in
with
for
that
its
also
a
great
gateway
beer
pours
a
light
amber
with
short
quickly
fading
head
with
some
light
lacing
smells
of
raspberry
and
malt
with
no
other
notes
coming
forward
on
the
nose
tastes
as
one
would
expect
but
a
watery
finish
took
a
lot
from
what
this
beer
could
have
been
capable
of
mouthfeel
was
just
ok
with
some
small
light
bubbles
and
light
body
this
beer
is
by
far
my
favorite
to
drink
mostly
in
the
summer
but
i
love
to
relax
with
a
couple
pints
in
the
winter
as
well
it
doesnt
have
a
fake
raspberry
flavor
to
it
and
goes
down
smooth
sitting
on
the
back
porch
outside
in
the
sun
is
my
favorite
time
to
enjoy
the
lightly
flavored
raspberry
and
the
smooth
hefeweizen
beer
o
disappointing
excepting
the
flavor
o
pleasantly
suprised
hefes
arent
really
my
thing
and
neither
are
fruit
beers
typically
but
i
really
liked
the
subtle
raspberry
in
this
one
and
the
hefe
qualities
were
great
i
can
certainly
see
myself
drinking
this
again
and
will
also
sample
harpoons
regualr
hefe
because
of
this
stuff
i
am
not
usually
a
huge
fruited
beer
fan
but
this
one
is
exceptional
by
all
standards
it
pours
a
murky
pink
tinted
wheat
beer
pale
yellow
color
with
a
robust
inch
and
a
half
of
white
head
with
superb
retention
the
nose
is
quite
tart
taking
on
much
more
acidity
and
piquancy
from
the
berries
than
jammy
sweetness
light
banana
and
clove
from
the
yeast
a
little
dumbed
down
and
americanized
from
the
authentic
german
hefes
but
still
in
that
vein
raspberry
is
more
dominant
than
what
malt
in
the
taste
and
i
love
the
tartness
here
almost
having
a
wild
ale
sort
of
yeast
and
funk
complexion
albeit
more
approachable
and
indeed
more
drinkable
than
most
of
those
very
light
in
the
finish
careful
hopping
provides
enough
bitterness
to
not
let
the
berries
be
overly
sweet
but
not
enough
to
make
this
a
hoppy
brew
the
balance
is
expert
carbonated
like
soda
this
is
nice
and
refreshing
when
served
ice
cold
in
the
summer
one
of
the
better
summer
fruit
beers
and
one
of
harpoons
best
ufo
brews
serving
type
64oz
growler
pours
a
pink
hazy
orange
with
a
frothy
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
dominated
by
raspberry
with
some
wheat
and
yeast
coming
through
taste
is
all
raspberry
from
start
to
finish
with
the
wheat
coming
through
at
the
end
minot
much
else
going
on
a
decent
flavor
but
could
have
more
depth
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
smooth
easy
drinker
flavor
doesnt
get
overwhelming
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
amazing
going
on
here
but
not
bad
sourcing
purchased
at
heb
in
texas
in
june
of
2013
7
99
for
a
sixpack
of
twelveounce
bottles
overall
a
relatively
easy
to
drinking
hefe
with
a
moderate
but
not
obnoxious
raspberry
flavor
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
raspberry
aromas
and
flavors
help
to
spice
up
hat
would
be
a
pedestrian
american
pale
wheat
ale
o
almost
like
wheaty
yeasty
raspberry
soda
not
much
like
beer
at
all
not
bad
though
easy
enough
to
drink
but
leaves
this
one
for
the
girls
who
enjoy
sweet
fruity
malt
beverages
o
not
bad
but
nothing
really
special
it
is
just
raspberry
flavoring
added
to
regular
ufo
i
really
wish
they
had
added
some
real
raspberry
into
the
process
for
brewing
these
so
that
some
of
the
wonderful
tartness
of
raspberries
would
come
through
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
hot
weather
beer
just
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
tartish
raspberry
and
vegetal
raspberry
seeds
up
front
moderate
raspberry
and
cherry
sweetness
into
the
palate
wheat
bread
and
hefeweizenish
yeasty
fruit
notes
follow
tartish
raspberry
stays
throughout
providing
a
nice
foil
to
the
rest
of
the
flavors
it
also
keeps
the
beer
refreshing
and
light
moderate
body
with
a
lively
sprightly
feel
a
nice
summer
quencher
especially
if
you
like
raspberries
o
very
refreshing
but
its
flat
in
flavor
easy
to
drink
but
not
that
exciting
i
got
bored
after
about
a
third
of
a
12oz
glass
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
not
go
to
say
it
is
now
a
favorite
of
mine
but
i
feel
it
deserves
credit
were
due
i
will
not
argue
at
all
if
someone
were
to
offer
me
one
o
well
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
again
just
wasnt
that
impressed
for
me
still
good
for
the
style
i
give
it
props
for
having
a
true
raspberry
character
with
some
great
tartness
in
the
flavor
and
some
pucker
in
the
feel
criminal
to
call
it
a
hefeweizen
it
had
a
nice
rose
color
body
with
a
2
head
that
layed
down
quickly
the
smell
was
of
tart
raspberries
and
some
wheat
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
smell
nice
raspberries
and
wheat
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouth
feel
was
great
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
has
become
a
go
to
summer
beer
for
me
it
has
just
an
amazing
flavor
and
the
raspberries
give
the
hefeweizen
that
extra
flavor
i
just
started
buying
the
ufo
sample
pack
last
year
that
includes
their
hefeweizen
pale
ale
and
white
ale
this
was
a
summer
staple
for
me
last
year
after
replacing
the
sam
adams
summer
ale
that
as
been
on
a
steady
decline
for
the
past
few
years
o
perfect
for
a
nice
warm
day
certainly
not
for
those
fruit
averse
refreshing
with
every
sip
from
a
bottle

it
pours
a
very
heady
medium
amber
with
a
reddish
tint
when
held
to
the
light
raspberries
introduce
themselves
to
the
nose
immediately
with
more
muted
bready
malts
and
clean
crisp
mildly
hopped
character
it
smells
like
it
would
be
a
great
way
to
cool
off
on
a
hot
day
the
body
is
light
to
medium
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
raspberry
which
tends
to
overtake
everything
else
still
it
ends
tart
and
slightly
dry
found
at
the
four
points
hotel
bar
in
revere
ma
this
brew
shows
a
dark
amber
glow
with
yellow
edges
a
modest
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
sign
of
lacing
the
aroma
gives
off
mild
tart
raspberry
and
sweet
grass
the
flavor
brings
a
sour
raspberry
with
lemon
wheat
theres
a
dry
citrus
hop
finish
in
this
somewhat
thin
bodied
summer
brew
with
tiny
bubbles
to
tickle
the
palate
it
has
a
watermelonlike
quality
but
to
me
this
gets
old
fast
not
my
favorite
fruit
beer
could
use
more
grainy
substance
to
balance
out
the
fruit
tart
theme
but
it
probably
would
make
for
a
decent
change
up
during
the
summer
served
ice
cold
and
refreshing
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
maybe
a
slight
blush
of
pink
two
fingers
of
light
foam
that
disappears
very
quickly
aroma
is
strongly
that
of
the
raspberries
promised
on
the
label
same
goes
for
the
taste
very
fruit
forward
near
perfect
carbonation
with
no
vile
aftertaste
i
talked
my
distributor
into
selling
me
this
as
a
single
im
going
back
tomorrow
for
the
other
5
sneakily
good
probably
a
better
summer
beer
being
so
light
and
easy
o
did
not
knock
my
socks
off
it
is
what
it
is
a
good
beach
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
beer
looks
very
pretty
its
orange
with
ruby
hues
and
a
tall
frothy
white
head
it
smells
of
raspberry
and
wheat
and
more
raspberry
it
tastes
great
to
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
good
i
tasted
tart
raspberry
right
from
the
start
it
kind
of
makes
the
mouth
pucker
there
is
a
lot
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
lemon
this
beer
is
light
and
the
carbonation
attacks
the
tongue
it
finishes
very
dry
i
thought
this
was
the
best
of
the
ufo
mixed
pack
i
got
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
the
worst
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
d
i
like
fruit
beers
made
with
real
fruit
it
adds
a
roundness
and
well
integrated
complexity
that
really
sets
them
apart
instead
of
being
annoyingly
cloying
at
worst
or
just
mindlessly
drinkable
you
get
an
interesting
quencher
the
brewery
says
natural
fruit
flavor
rather
than
real
fruit
but
it
seems
authentic
even
if
it
is
not
real
whole
fruit
poured
on
tap
at
a
local
irish
pub
the
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
redtinged
color
almost
peachy
with
a
thin
foamy
dense
layer
of
filmy
head
that
coats
the
top
of
the
beer
as
well
as
any
part
of
the
glass
it
touches
the
aromas
are
heavy
raspberry
sweet
with
a
deep
dark
sweet
aroma
like
when
you
are
mixing
raspberry
jello
with
the
boiling
water
flavors
are
surprisingly
well
blended
with
an
initial
toasted
grain
flavor
that
is
quickly
followed
by
a
strong
but
not
overpowering
raspberry
tangy
sweet
character
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
the
toasted
and
a
bit
of
the
tangy
sweet
but
light
overall
the
finish
is
a
bit
tart
with
a
slight
coating
left
behind
tasty
brew
great
on
a
hot
day
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
its
not
going
to
win
awards
as
a
great
beer
but
its
much
better
than
i
expected
its
not
something
ill
drink
in
the
cold
weather
months
but
hits
the
spot
when
mother
nature
brings
the
heat
poured
a
bit
purpleish
amber
average
head
and
wheat
character
with
a
nicely
crisp
body
even
though
the
lable
notes
that
natural
raspberry
flavor
is
added
it
had
a
tinge
of
artificiality
to
it
and
rang
of
flavoring
adjunct
rather
than
brewing
component
sweetness
was
well
moderated
so
that
it
did
not
come
across
as
a
fruit
cooler
but
not
the
most
impressive
example
either
overall
this
was
generally
nice
nothing
special
but
enjoyable
and
refreshing
i
know
my
review
sounds
meh
if
anything
but
i
would
buy
this
again
for
a
summer
quencher
overall
i
loved
this
beer
i
am
buying
more
of
this
until
its
gone
for
the
season
almost
the
perfect
summertime
beer
i
drank
it
but
it
was
an
effort
skip
this
one
the
color
of
this
beer
is
a
nice
pinkish
red
and
the
nose
delivers
a
light
raspberry
smell
i
am
able
to
drink
a
6
pack
of
these
and
be
perfectly
content
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
tire
of
drinking
easily
they
are
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
fruit
complements
the
base
beer
very
nicely
the
abv
is
just
right
i
enjoy
regular
ufo
but
i
will
definitely
choose
this
instead
anytime
overall
a
wonderful
spring
summer
brew
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
a
warm
day
perfect
for
outdoor
outings
bbqs
in
fact
i
drank
it
while
grilling
last
night
and
it
was
incredibly
smooth
similar
beers
in
this
area
are
southern
tier
raspberry
wheat
id
definitely
buy
try
again
a
very
good
choice
for
a
bbq
beer
ive
had
this
on
tap
as
well
and
would
not
hesitate
to
have
it
again
if
your
looking
to
try
something
a
little
bit
different
this
summer
i
would
try
a
bottle
of
this
brew
oa
solid
fruit
beer
possibly
the
best
of
the
ufo
series
from
what
i
remember
from
the
ones
i
havent
reviewed
very
similar
to
the
white
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
ruby
hue
slightly
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
a
sour
raspberry
smell
with
a
backing
of
heffe
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
ton
of
wheat
upfront
with
the
yeasty
raspberry
coming
through
a
medicinal
raspberry
flavor
over
a
tangy
wheat
body
could
barely
get
through
a
bottle
of
this
with
the
raspberry
assaulting
my
taste
buds
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
fantastic
bbq
beer
and
it
would
be
really
hard
to
find
someone
who
honestly
wouldnt
like
it
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
warmer
months
and
a
much
better
choice
over
the
typical
blue
moon
or
other
summer
seasonal
beers
available
on
tap
at
your
average
bar
not
the
greatest
fruit
beer
in
the
world
but
it
works
o
this
beer
really
surprised
me
the
raspberry
never
got
to
be
too
much
flavorwise
which
makes
this
a
nice
summertime
beer
the
abv
makes
this
a
easy
beer
to
sit
around
and
have
with
friends
i
really
liked
this
beer
maybe
a
little
too
much
but
we
all
have
to
have
our
guilty
pleasure
beers
right
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
what
it
is
if
you
like
fruit
wheats
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
out
there
for
you
perfectly
balanced
flavor
profile
unique
in
color
i
picture
this
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
now
if
only
it
came
in
cans
d
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
without
being
empty
the
fruit
addition
on
top
of
the
hefewizen
base
is
a
really
nice
combination
this
raspberry
wheat
started
off
pretty
good
the
pour
was
nice
with
a
big
fluffy
head
on
it
the
beer
was
was
cloudy
golden
yellow
and
not
transparent
at
all
the
smell
was
quite
refreshing
on
this
beer
it
had
the
aroma
of
sweet
fresh
raspberries
of
course
that
were
very
pleasant
the
flavors
were
a
little
on
the
weak
side
i
thought
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
more
raspberry
all
over
this
one
a
little
bummed
out
that
it
wasnt
a
strong
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
mild
light
carbonation
the
beer
is
good
i
just
wouldnt
need
to
have
it
again
will
be
a
great
beer
for
a
cookout
or
lounging
in
the
heat
but
enjoyable
now
in
the
winter
as
well
a
good
beer
to
get
wine
drinkers
into
the
beer
world
with
ala
lambics
was
definitely
intrigued
when
i
first
saw
this
and
upon
first
taste
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
raspberry
name
pinkish
color
with
a
sweet
smell
taste
is
somewhat
tart
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
raspberry
i
can
see
it
being
a
great
session
beer
even
though
i
wasnt
too
crazy
about
the
tart
aftertaste
it
has
a
very
soft
mouthfeel
a
little
like
soda
to
be
honest
and
you
can
barely
notice
the
alcohol
all
in
all
if
you
like
fruity
beer
give
this
one
a
shot
db
i
can
see
how
this
beer
would
really
catch
on
with
the
main
stream
anyone
who
has
ever
mixed
sparkling
water
with
fruit
juice
knows
this
flavor
it
just
feels
watered
down
overall
quite
disappointing
after
a
good
aroma
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
light
reddishpink
color
with
a
head
that
is
mostly
white
but
has
just
the
tiniest
touch
of
a
pink
bubblegumlike
hue
nose
is
some
fresh
raspberries
that
are
mostly
sweet
but
a
little
bit
tart
taste
is
more
raspberry
with
some
faint
wheat
pretty
light
body
and
nice
drinkability
its
definitely
a
fruit
beer
but
doesnt
go
too
far
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
color
with
a
large
head
that
stayed
throughout
it
smells
of
raspberries
and
beer
not
the
best
combination
it
tastes
very
strongly
of
raspberries
and
just
a
little
bit
of
a
wheat
like
beer
taste
doesnt
tatse
like
beer
really
at
all
overall
not
bad
if
you
like
raspberries
not
too
much
of
a
beer
though
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
however
the
sweetness
might
limit
me
to
no
more
than
2
or
so
of
these
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
d
well
my
friend
hated
it
and
i
ended
up
drinking
the
rest
as
fast
as
i
could
to
get
rid
of
them
but
the
tartness
of
the
raspberrys
got
so
cloying
after
a
while
i
just
kept
them
till
now
would
pass
if
it
was
offered
to
me
today
drink
not
my
style
of
beer
my
wife
sure
enjoyed
it
though
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
appeal
to
some
especially
during
warmer
weather
d
very
easy
no
alc
impressed
by
how
fruity
it
really
is
too
sweet
to
have
more
then
a
couple
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
drinkable
its
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
it
isnt
bad
i
give
them
credit
for
making
a
fruit
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
the
fruit
its
supposed
to
and
does
so
without
seeming
artificial
this
beer
is
a
little
like
beersoda
but
its
really
quite
good
and
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
of
its
class
maybe
its
really
the
style
that
im
displeased
by
not
the
particular
beer
pretty
good
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
but
still
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
overall
quite
good
for
what
it
is
its
got
nice
raspberry
flavor
in
spades
ufo
raspberry
hefeweizen
is
a
good
offering
from
harpoon
the
base
beer
what
i
can
tasteof
it
really
isnt
a
hefeweizen
more
of
an
american
wheat
but
truly
the
raspberries
dominate
in
this
beer
and
provides
the
majority
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
smell
of
raspberry
manifests
as
the
cap
is
popped
and
perfumes
the
air
as
the
beer
is
poured
the
color
is
a
orangey
red
with
a
wispy
white
lacing
the
raspberry
flavor
is
pronounced
and
tastes
very
fresh
overall
the
beer
is
tastes
like
its
a
common
wheat
beer
with
a
couple
jolly
ranchers
dissolved
into
it
good
in
its
own
way
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
candylike
to
be
a
great
beer
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
goes
down
easy
dvery
very
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
night
or
day
i
love
this
beer
i
get
made
fun
of
sometimes
because
of
its
pink
hue
but
man
this
is
an
underrated
beer
if
you
like
raspberries
and
you
would
rather
taste
real
raspberries
rather
than
artificial
splenda
aided
raspberry
flavor
try
this
dont
let
the
pink
color
fool
you
this
one
is
a
great
time
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
so
good
you
just
want
more
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
raspberry
hefeweizen
refreshment
on
a
hot
summer
day
that
offers
a
unique
spin
on
the
style
meh
avoid
quite
hazy
pink
grapefruit
colour
with
next
to
no
cap
fruity
aroma
raspberry
slight
banana
you
can
pick
up
a
hint
of
wheat
if
you
really
try
but
it
could
just
be
an
illusion
the
flavour
was
heavy
with
raspberry
but
the
mineral
character
and
coarse
carbonation
made
it
taste
processed
and
artificial
light
bodied
high
carbonation
a
bit
dry
i
really
like
raspberries
so
i
hoped
this
beer
would
impress
me
but
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
at
all
pretty
good
drinkability
but
the
rasberry
taste
gets
a
little
old
after
awhile
i
would
have
like
to
seen
a
little
more
hefe
characteristics
come
through
i
prolly
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
it
was
nice
to
try
pours
a
hazy
grapefruit
like
color
with
some
visible
carbonation
and
a
thick
three
finger
head
which
disapates
to
a
skim
with
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
fanstastic
it
hits
you
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
the
smell
of
raspberries
and
flowers
hits
your
nose
the
taste
is
very
good
also
the
taste
is
a
wheat
backbone
with
a
tart
raspberry
taste
the
taste
is
like
a
real
raspberry
not
artificial
and
super
sweet
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
creamy
overall
on
a
hot
day
on
your
porch
you
could
make
this
a
great
session
beer
a
great
aroma
and
a
smooth
taste
make
this
a
great
beer
md
a
little
thin
but
very
drinkable
if
you
like
fruit
beers
you
will
love
this
one
overall
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
again
i
liked
it
but
my
buddies
were
not
impressed
and
i
like
regular
hefeweizens
better
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
does
not
offer
much
to
make
me
want
another
or
to
even
finish
this
one
i
just
think
they
were
in
between
a
few
ideas
it
definitely
fits
some
tastes
however
overall
i
like
hefeweizens
and
i
like
fruit
beers
if
they
are
not
sweet
especially
in
the
summer
i
saw
this
come
in
and
since
i
enjoyed
the
abita
purple
haze
enough
i
did
some
reading
up
on
the
ufo
i
am
glad
i
decided
to
get
it
without
a
doubt
a
perfect
summer
quencher
it
is
light
yet
has
flavor
oftentimes
summer
beers
mean
light
dreary
wheat
that
lacks
zing
that
is
not
the
case
with
this
beer
d
a
summer
beer
for
sure
this
one
is
very
easy
drinking
raspberry
flavor
almost
makes
it
a
sour
with
none
of
the
complexity
watery
in
the
mouth
and
a
real
thirst
quencher
however
im
looking
for
a
little
more
than
just
quenching
in
my
beers
so
ill
pass
unless
this
is
the
only
around
d
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
was
certainly
drinkable
worth
a
try
but
maybe
not
something
you
would
want
more
than
a
few
of
the
beer
has
a
slight
reddish
hue
the
white
head
dissipated
very
quickly
almost
like
soda
the
smell
is
of
raspberry
booth
sweet
and
tart
this
beer
starts
sweet
and
finishes
refreshingly
tart
the
tart
finish
separates
this
from
most
typical
soda
beers
it
makes
it
refreshing
and
nice
a
nicely
done
fruit
beer
raspberries
add
to
a
beer
that
is
american
pale
wheat
with
a
hw
influence
not
too
sweet
a
very
refreshing
brew
raspberry
doesnt
overwhelm
this
is
how
american
fruit
beers
should
be
d
a
fantastic
beer
regardless
of
style
very
drinkable
if
you
like
raspberry
or
berry
flavors
this
is
the
best
i
have
had
and
ive
tried
many
fruit
flavored
beers
this
is
the
best
raspberry
hands
down
probably
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
but
the
fresher
the
better
nonetheless
overall
while
not
the
greatest
fruit
beer
in
the
world
it
works
light
and
clean
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
not
mind
trying
it
again
overall
i
prefer
the
original
but
this
one
was
worth
a
try
as
mentioned
in
the
drinkability
its
easy
to
session
thats
for
sure
and
if
im
ever
in
the
mood
to
have
some
raspberries
in
my
swill
this
will
be
a
goto
drinkability
just
an
all
around
great
beer
any
friend
i
introduce
it
to
proceeds
to
tell
me
that
they
are
going
to
go
pick
some
up
right
then
probably
best
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
think
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
all
the
time
its
that
delicious
and
sweet
overall
a
very
good
beer
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
just
the
right
mix
of
tartsweet
to
keep
you
interested
d
its
something
i
would
like
to
have
every
now
and
then
but
its
definitely
not
my
go
to
beer
for
kicking
back
on
the
deck
in
the
summer
i
cant
really
have
more
than
1
or
2
without
getting
sick
of
the
flavor

12
oz

nh
hazy
orange
with
a
pinkish
undertone
color
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
very

smell
the
raspberries
is

very
drinkable
theres
a

hue
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
very
difficult
to
see
through
the
most
powerful
odor
to
come
off
of
this
beer
is
raspberry
for
sure
it
smells
like
raspberry
jam
my
wife
barged
in
and
claimed
her
love
for
it
and
i
told
her
to
get
the
hell
out
of
here
i
havent
even
tasted
it
yet
very
mild
sweet
and
sour
very
much
like
raspberries
theres
a
hint
of
typical
wheat
beer
characteristic
but
the
most
abundant
flavor
is
raspberry
and
its
very
good
tasty
i
know
that
most
dont
like
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
worth
the
try
i
loved
it
was
surprised
by
it
and
will
have
it
again
overall
a
decent
fruit
beer
that
could
amke
for
sa
refreshing
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
12oz
poured
a
hazy
pinkish
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
with
maybe
a
pinkish
tinge
also
aroma
was
raspberries
and
thats
about
it
tastes
were
mainly
artificial
raspberry
with
a
slight
biscuitywheaty
character
overly
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
more
tartness
may
have
helped
to
balance
the
sweetness
out
decent
in
small
doses
but
there
are
better
fruit
beers
out
there
in
my
opinion
once
again
i
think
the
term
hefeweizen
is
misleading
as
with
their
regular
ufo
d
not
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
not
really
something
that
i
usually
go
for
but
i
think
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
recommended
md
nice
carbonation
a
bit
of
zip
to
it
but
the
taste
seems
too
artificial
to
me
drinkability
lambics
are
not
my
thing
but
being
this
is
a
hefe
style
i
can
drink
this
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
day
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
and
is
thus
far
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
overall
im
definitely
interested
in
buying
a
6pack
of
this
stuff
if
i
can
find
it
this
is
a
great
fruit
beer
period
d
good
stuff
overall
which
comes
exactly
as
advertised
i
wouldnt
go
overboard
but
it
can
be
sessioned
too
easily
a
sun
beer
that
comes
recommended
smells
like
raspberry
ginger
ale
with
a
slightly
buttery
yeast
tang
tastes
like
raspberry
ginger
ale
with
a
slightly
buttery
yeast
tang
offensively
tart
in
all
the
wrong
places
not
much
wheat
here
at
all
some
citrus
hops
would
really
have
complemented
the
flavor
as
with
most
fruit
beers
this
is
a
one
and
done
drinkability
this
is
a
one
glass
beer
as
the
fruitiness
grows
a
bit
tiring
nice
flavor
but
in
short
bursts
only
d
excellent
could
drink
these
pops
all
night
the
gf
really
enjoyed
this
beer
too
bad
we
only
got
one
sample
bottle
i
would
have
to
be
truthful
and
say
that
i
did
not
find
this
first
experince
with
raspberry
ufo
as
being
a
posistive
one
i
think
the
main
reason
that
i
may
have
been
turned
off
was
the
aftertaste
and
this
beer
being
in
the
wrong
glass
i
think
a
tulip
glass
may
have
improved
the
experience
so
a
second
review
will
be
in
order
overall
still
not
very
impressive
but
a
bit
better
than
the
regular
ufo
hefe
its
kind
of
like
a
runofthemill
wheat
ale
with
raspberry
thrown
in
none
of
this
is
overpowering
but
a
decent
drinking
hefe
overall
i
really
dislike
this
beer
but
im
being
really
openminded
in
my
ratings
just
a
little
underdone
in
every
category
i
cannot
see
myself
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
or
another
one
in
my
lifetime
for
that
matter
d
im
having
trouble
finishing
this
one
still
not
a
big
fan
of
this
i
would
rather
have
something
that
taste
like
beer
but
this
isnt
too
bad
i
can
drink
it
not
gonna
lie
kinda
makes
me
feel
girly
though
i
feel
like
it
takes
points
off
my
man
card
can
see
this
being
refreshing
in
the
summer
but
i
would
still
plump
for
a
reputable
german
weizen
such
as
weihenstephan
or
a
frambozen
from
liefmans
for
something
fruit
based
overall
a
very
solid
beer
great
raspberry
flavoring
without
being
too
overpowering
the
only
big
negative
is
the
wheat
like
flavor
that
is
somewhat
dominant
in
the
beer
light
bodied
and
pretty
drinkable
i
am
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
however
and
this
one
would
not
help
convert
me
drinkability
very
easily
consumed
light
bodied
and
tasty
i
could
see
these
things
disappear
on
a
hot
summers
day
my
only
gripe
is
the
sweetness
i
would
imagine
this
beer
would
be
much
better
with
a
little
less
sweetness
an
okay
beer
good
if
you
like
raspberries
somewhat
of
an
acerbic
mouthfeel
makes
this
just
another
middle
of
the
road
fruit
beer
brewed
with
wheat
in
the
grain
bill

1
85
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
clean
clear
16oz
mixing
glass
the
beer
has
a
pinkish
orange
tint
brought
on
by
the
addition
of
raspberries
the
head
also
has
a
mild
tint
to
it
this
beer
has
a
unique
appearance
enhanced
by
the
clear
glass
being
used
the
smell
is
of
fresh
berries
the
head
lingers
more
than
i
would
expect
from
a
fruit
beer
a
positive
there
is
no
mention
of
the
abv
on
the
bottle
which
is
a
negative
even
though
i
know
it
is
5
1
from
this
website
as
well
as
harpoons
the
taste
is
very
crisp
light
and
assertive
fresh
berries
abound
with
lasting
notes
on
the
tongue
an
enjoyable
beer
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
probably
layer
nicely
with
a
guinness
float
if
you
wanted
to
cut
the
flavor
d
only
if
someone
gavebought
me
one
or
if
selection
is
slim
dont
think
ill
look
to
buy
this
one
again
appearance
was
a
tad
disappointing
with
a
minimal
head
and
pinkish
copper
tone
smell
was
mainly
raspberry
syrup
with
a
hint
of
malt
taste
was
overly
that
of
raspberry
not
much
wheat
or
malt
coming
through
mouthfeel
was
dry
with
a
lightly
bitter
finish
drinkability
was
ok
but
nothing
spectacular
eric
a
pretty
decent
beer
would
make
for
a
refreshing
summer
brew
i
probably
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
one
session
though
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
the
summer
i
tend
to
like
blueberry
fruit
beers
more
but
this
it
the
best
raspberry
beer
ive
had
give
it
a
try
on
a
hot
summer
evening
mfd
i
wish
i
would
have
known
how
good
this
beer
was
while
the
warm
weather
was
hear
im
sure
it
would
be
a
hit
with
the
ladies
really
drinkable
beer
maybe
its
just
because
i
love
raspberry
but
this
is
a
good
beer
have
had
worse
not
my
thing
really
but
drinks
ok
enough
d
this
is
an
alright
brew
and
while
it
luckily
doesnt
cross
the
line
of
overly
fruity
and
too
sweet
it
also
isnt
interesting
enough
to
come
back
to
easy
drinking
but
fairly
boring
significantly
better
than
the
standard
ufo
hefe
the
touch
of
raspberry
adds
what
the
other
doesnt
have
flavor
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
found
it
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
which
works
in
my
book
d
would
be
good
quencher
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
by
itself
but
not
necessarily
a
session
still
drinks
and
fairs
much
better
then
their
original
hefeweizen
nice
appearance
and
aroma
unusual
combination
of
dryness
and
sweetness
starts
off
dry
and
then
sweet
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
at
the
end
would
possibly
enjoy
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
i
assume
is
intended
would
buy
again
in
a
6
pack
to
give
it
a
chance
as
i
just
bought
1
bottle
to
taste
pours
a
strange
reddishorange
hue
with
a
miniscule
head
that
seems
slightly
shaded
pink
nose
is
dominated
by
a
raspberry
jam
aroma
and
not
much
else
somewhat
watery
palate
starting
off
with
more
raspberries
before
simplifying
down
to
a
wheaty
dry
crisp
finish
with
almost
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
not
too
sweet
thankfully
but
just
not
really
my
style
12
oz

7up
flavor

very
thin
feel

and
a

not
bad
overall
just
a
bit
too
tart
and
fruity
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
a
good
taste
and
decent
mouthfeel
make
drinking
it
very
easy
definitely
an
excellent
summer
beer
overall
drinkability
it
is
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good

some
wheat
high
carbonation
and
a

summery
yes
but
a
little
weak
for
my
preference
long
tart
finish
but
it
left
me
with
a
weird
aftertaste
more
of
a
fruit
beer
than
a
hefeweizen
from
notes
overall
this
brew
is
decent
on
a
hot
day
but
i
would
not
drink
too
many
otherwise
feel
has
a
slight
to
medium
body
and
the
carbonation
is
adequate
although
maybe
a
little
too
aggressive
for
a
hefe
drinkability
is
high
due
to
it
being
tasty
refreshing
and
easily
found
pours
a
clear
amber
that
has
a
ruby
hue
to
it
looking
at
it
makes
me
think
of
a
rose
champagne
nose
is
raspberries
almost
like
a
syrup
was
added
flavor
has
a
fully
artificial
edge
to
it
raspberries
yes
syrup
yes
real
fruit
no
its
like
drinking
fruit
juice
feel
has
a
biting
carbonation
to
it
and
the
liquid
is
slick
easy
to
drink
but
more
alcopop
than
fine
beer
pass
overall
an
excellent
offering
for
the
summer
itll
taste
great
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
even
better
paired
with
a
salad
d
once
again
the
fruit
beers
are
not
for
me
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
i
was
also
taken
by
how
perfectly
carbonated
this
beer
is
its
very
bubbly
a
feature
that
would
make
it
particularly
satisfying
on
a
hot
day
and
at
a
relatively
low
4
8
alcohol
content
you
can
safely
drink
a
bunch
as
you
while
away
a
day
in
the
sun
this
brew
from
harpoon
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
i
was
a
little
hesitant
at
first
as
hefe
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
in
my
beer
im
glad
i
decided
to
try
this
one
a
few
years
ago
the
beer
pours
a
little
cloudy
with
an
interesting
reddish
hue
the
smell
of
raspberries
is
intoxicating
no
pun
intended
the
beer
flows
smooth
and
you
can
enjoy
this
all
day
long
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
enjoy
this
beer
so
much
that
i
had
to
purchase
my
own
ufo
raspberry
hefeweizen
glass
the
beer
is
an
interesting
twist
on
the
traditional
hefeweizen
and
it
will
certainly
have
you
coming
back
for
more
as
many
others
have
stated
the
first
thing
one
will
notice
when
drinking
is
the
instant
aroma
personally
i
felt
the
aroma
was
nice
but
not
what
i
wanted
in
a
beer
for
me
it
was
a
bad
sign
of
what
was
to
come
in
drinking
it
pours
very
nicely
and
has
a
wonderful
orange
to
pinkish
color
easily
drinkable
but
the
hefeweizen
style
and
raspberry
flavor
for
this
particular
beer
doesnt
mix
well
would
recommend
drinking
something
else
although
try
it
at
least
once
for
its
interesting
taste
a
very
solid
fruit
beer
i
enjoy
it
much
more
than
the
regular
ufo
a
flavorful
ultrarefreshing
unfiltered
fruit
beer
thats
all
it
is
note
to
self
buy
more
raspberry
ufo
throughout
the
summer
not
bad
not
bad
raspberry
is
good
in
beer
apparently
poured
a
medium
coppery
red
with
a
fair
head
on
it
the
raspberry
smell
was
immediate
and
intense
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
a
strong
amount
of
raspberries
into
a
pretty
straightforward
wheat
beer
it
seemed
just
the
right
amount
of
berry
in
this
one
the
brew
seemed
pretty
carbonated
and
although
pretty
good
itd
be
slow
going
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
fruity
beverages
in
a
row
its
just
not
my
bag
incidentally
this
site
lists
the
beer
as
5
1
the
label
on
my
bottle
states
4
7
abv
are
there
two
versions
drinkability
just
the
right
amount
of
raspberry
flavor
i
could
even
clear
through
an
entire
pint
of
this
stuff
and
not
lose
my
cool
though
any
more
might
be
a
slightly
daunting
task
crisp
smooth
and
mediumlight
bodied
refreshing
change
of
pace
palate
cleansing
with
a
nice
tart
finish
md
a
light
beer
that
was
very
reminiscent
of
a
soda
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
it
sported
a
significant
amount
of
carbonation
which
mixed
in
with
the
sugary
smell
and
taste
made
it
very
much
like
a
spiked
soda
d
this
beer
is
a
little
sweet
for
me
and
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
setting
still
a
good
tasting
fruit
beer
this
12
pack
was
my
first
experience
with
the
raspberry
hefeweizen
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
impressed
the
brew
poured
to
a
dull
goldenamber
color
and
seemed
to
have
a
slight
red
hue
to
it
medium
sized
off
white
head
that
also
seemed
to
have
a
redpink
hue
that
had
some
retention
and
left
some
fair
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
very
strong
berry
scent
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
also
present
and
noticeable
is
the
nice
wheat
scent
the
flavors
where
very
nice
strong
raspberry
flavor
that
has
a
slight
tart
feel
to
it
the
wheat
flavors
take
a
back
seat
in
this
one
but
based
on
the
berry
flavor
i
think
that
is
ok
nice
carbonation
that
helps
add
a
slight
spiciness
with
what
i
guess
might
be
some
hops
in
the
background
to
me
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
suppose
that
it
could
be
because
it
is
so
different
that
what
i
would
normally
expect
d
overall
a
very
nice
fruit
beer
maybe
the
best
nonsour
one
ive
had
i
like
how
this
is
very
low
on
the
bitterness
scale
and
really
accents
the
fruit
this
has
a
very
original
auroma
and
flavor
ive
had
a
few
different
raspberry
beers
and
one
thing
i
like
about
this
one
is
that
the
flavor
isnt
too
overpowering
it
pours
a
cool
cloudy
peach
color
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
makes
sweet
lace
patterns
on
my
hefeweizen
glass
perfume
like
raspberry
hits
the
nose
as
the
bottle
is
opened
the
flavor
and
body
were
very
light
and
thin
the
flavor
has
some
tart
raspberry
with
hints
of
lemon
and
melon
the
palate
is
to
light
and
thin
with
some
light
fizzy
carbonation
the
finish
is
abrupt
and
leaves
me
wanting
something
more
overall
it
has
a
good
taste
but
lacks
depth
and
body
pours
a
very
bright
lavender
color
almost
pink
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
head
and
no
lacing
not
unusual
for
a
wheat
beer
it
had
just
a
little
too
much
color
for
me
nice
scent
all
of
it
raspberry
though
i
could
get
hints
of
the
crisp
wheat
beer
in
it
but
nothing
of
a
malty
or
straw
aroma
excellent
taste
though
the
raspberry
is
strong
and
dominant
but
here
is
where
the
wheat
beer
comes
through
with
a
nice
refreshing
sweetness
excellent
mouthfeel
too
it
goes
down
very
well
not
my
favorite
fruited
wheat
as
it
was
a
little
too
over
done
with
the
raspberries
but
still
quite
good
d
for
me
a
little
of
this
goes
a
long
way
although
interesting
and
relatively
enjoyable
there
wasnt
anything
that
was
compelling
me
to
consume
with
any
fervor
the
taste
hits
you
with
the
fruit
flavor
early
but
the
aftertaste
dries
out
a
bit
but
not
in
a
positive
way
the
texture
is
flat
and
fairly
lifeless
i
can
see
this
being
somewhat
refreshing
on
a
ht
day
but
im
just
not
feeling
it
this
is
a
typical
fruit
beer
its
not
terrible
and
has
some
things
to
recommend
it
but
it
doesnt
really
give
me
the
full
beer
experience
and
i
wont
look
for
it
again
d
very
drinkable
beer
ill
definitely
have
some
of
this
around
for
myself
after
a
workout
or
run
it
also
would
do
nicely
for
a
party
or
gettogethera
fresh
fun
beer
to
have
around
to
change
things
up
overall
i
would
not
consider
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
the
taste
was
quite
harsh
to
my
mouth
but
i
would
suggest
it
to
anyone
do
to
its
uniqueness
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
it
was
tough
to
finish
two
ounces
its
overwhelmingly
sweet
and
tastes
like
a
wine
cooler
more
than
a
beer
the
majority
of
our
group
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
i
certainly
wont
buy
it
and
would
suggest
numerous
other
fruit
beers
ahead
of
this
one
d
goes
down
easy
but
not
memorable
a
one
and
done
type
brew
very
few
characteristics
of
a
good
hefeweizen
are
present
this
beer
was
well
balanced
i
could
drink
it
all
afternoon
wroking
outside
in
a
hot
weather
not
good
to
me
but
the
lady
likes
it
dits
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
light
and
refreshing
the
raspberry
goes
really
well
with
the
hefeweizen
and
does
not
try
to
over
power
it
a
wonderful
lighter
alternative
to
a
framboise
perhaps
a
warm
weather
offering
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
very
easy
on
the
stomach
you
could
drink
up
to
12
of
these
with
no
issues
drinkability
ill
definatly
by
another
six
pack
of
this
this
is
a
fruit
beer
if
you
dont
like
sweet
and
you
dont
like
fruit
this
isnt
for
you
for
the
rest
of
us
who
like
a
decently
sweet
beer
without
that
bitter
twinge
drink
up
d
i
could
probably
have
a
couple
in
warmer
weather
but
i
probably
wont
dnot
really
feeling
their
wheat
beers
way
too
tannic
tasting
i
believe
there
are
other
versions
out
there
of
fruit
wheat
beers
that
are
better
this
one
would
be
nice
if
it
just
didnt
have
that
awkward
tannic
bite
at
the
end
annoying
rather
than
quenching
because
of
it
d
not
too
bad
for
a
fruit
beer
my
only
main
gripe
was
its
deviation
from
a
true
hefeweizen
it
was
more
watery
and
not
thick
and
cloudy
maybe
a
bad
batch
i
would
be
willing
to
try
again
drinkability
definitely
a
chick
beer
although
not
horrible
this
isnt
complex
enough
to
be
a
good
beer
very
simple
this
could
serve
as
a
beer
to
bridge
the
gap
to
craft
beer
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
revisit
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
mildly
fruity
with
a
mild
raspberry
aftertaste
i
feel
as
though
the
raspberry
worked
well
with
the
wheat
flavors
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
love
to
find
it
on
draft
overall
a
pretty
decent
fruit
beer
just
make
sure
its
not
ice
cold
from
one
of
them
christmas
gift
mixpacks
an
interesting
variation
on
a
hefeweizen
would
be
interested
in
seeing
more
of
these
types
d
if
you
like
raspberries
and
weizens
then
id
said
youd
love
this
im
not
extremely
fond
of
weizens
and
raspberries
are
just
ok
not
a
terrible
breweasy
to
drink
interesting
taste
and
something
different
but
its
not
something
id
bet
on
coming
back
to
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
with
lots
of
room
for
head
the
color
was
surprisingly
pink
with
some
orange
and
red
mixed
in
the
light
pink
head
was
very
large
very
cool
im
not
used
to
seeing
a
beer
with
that
color
unless
its
a
belgian
fruit
lambic
big
raspberry
aroma
but
it
pretty
much
overpowers
any
malt
or
hop
aroma
very
sweet
almost
spritzy
taste
carbonation
was
fairly
high
but
suited
the
beer
well
making
it
refreshing
and
quenching
a
little
too
artificial
tasting
to
become
something
that
i
would
continually
stock
my
fridge
with
but
a
nice
change
from
a
traditional
hefeweizen
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
pours
a
pinkish
color
with
a
pink
head
kind
of
like
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
thats
carbonated
the
aroma
is
a
of
very
strong
raspberries
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
raspberry
probably
too
strong
for
a
beer
but
it
is
actually
kind
of
refreshing
the
wheaty
malty
taste
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
and
it
really
is
a
nice
wheat
aftertaste
but
still
very
overwhelmingly
raspberryy
great
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
though
poured
a
bubbly
golden
with
an
offwhite
frothy
head
looks
pretty
good
in
the
glass
smell
was
of
tart
fruit
raspberry
as
advertised
with
a
soft
clovelike
aroma
taste
was
really
dry
and
acidic
for
me
due
to
the
raspberries
no
less
just
a
subtle
hint
of
the
crisp
wheat
malt
but
the
tartness
really
overpowered
it
mouthfeel
was
light
and
quickly
dissipated
across
the
palate
fairly
easy
to
drink
if
you
can
get
past
the
tartness
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
of
my
faves
the
taste
is
good
at
first
but
after
a
few
sips
the
blandness
kicks
in
some
creamy
vanilla
notes
pair
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
and
a
dominant
wheaty
note
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
but
not
much
else
too
much
carbonation
and
a
watery
thin
body
leave
me
wondering
if
this
is
beer
or
raspberryflavored
flat
champagne
i
cant
say
id
ever
buy
this
on
my
own
but
for
what
it
is
i
suppose
it
could
be
worse
a
nice
head
that
disolves
but
never
disappears
over
a
cloudy
pink
color
aroma
is
unmistakably
berry
taste
follows
and
its
almost
hard
to
find
the
beer
taste
underneath
all
the
berry
flavoring
the
aftertaste
is
you
guessed
it
more
berry
i
dont
want
this
to
necessarily
sound
bad
because
the
flavor
is
not
unpleasant
at
all
easy
to
drink
one
or
two
but
not
many
more
after
drinking
and
liking
harpoon
peche
i
had
high
hopes
for
ufo
raspberry
hefeweizen
i
thought
maybe
these
guys
had
figured
out
this
whole
fruit
beer
thing
not
quite
but
this
is
still
a
decent
warm
weather
beer
that
should
appeal
to
a
wide
range
of
people
i
recommend
this
beer
especially
when
sitting
outside
on
a
nice
day
watching
the
sun
go
down
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
on
hot
days
during
the
summer
pours
with
a
nice
head
although
it
dissipates
quickly
very
little
lacing
remains
during
the
tasting
amberpink
in
appearance
and
somewhat
cloudy
ive
had
varying
experiences
relative
to
the
visibility
of
yeast
in
the
glass
guess
it
depends
on
the
batch
however
my
expectation
is
that
there
should
be
some
residual
yeast
floating
in
the
brew
nice
subtle
smell
of
raspberry
but
not
overpowering
very
pleasant
in
the
mouth
a
little
bit
of
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
with
a
slightly
tart
finish
that
leaves
the
taste
of
raspberry
on
the
taste
buds
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
pinkish
hue
it
has
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
hefe
taste
with
loads
of
fresh
raspberry
flavoring
its
quite
fruity
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
light
hefe
flavor
that
goes
down
down
quick
and
finishes
crisp
and
fruity
its
dry
and
tart
with
a
lingering
raspberry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
i
wish
the
taste
was
as
fruity
as
the
aroma
its
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
all
in
all
a
fine
fruit
beer
girlfriends
can
rejoice
over
this
one
though
itll
save
your
guy
from
having
to
order
a
mich
ultra
or
smirnoff
ice
and
im
sure
theyd
appreciate
the
effort
to
foray
into
diverse
brews
i
give
harpoon
credit
for
creating
something
different
as
a
cousin
to
their
regular
ufo
good
mouth
feel
refreshing
but
not
something
i
could
drink
all
night
tastes
of
raspberries
some
citrus
and
a
slight
acidic
character
good
for
the
hot
summer
days
overall
impression
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
probably
would
be
a
great
gateway
and
they
definitely
go
down
easy
on
a
warm
day
i
guess
it
was
a
nobrainer
to
take
the
classic
ufo
and
add
raspberries
for
a
summer
seasonal
beer
fares
well
with
the
additions
i
have
always
found
the
base
beer
ufo
to
be
a
bit
subpar
compated
to
good
german
classics
but
the
fruit
flavors
contribute
a
ton
of
raspberry
character
the
wheat
malt
nose
is
dwarfed
by
strong
ripe
raspberries
tartness
and
a
bit
of
an
earthy
acidity
the
color
shows
a
typically
hazy
appearance
with
a
rubyred
grapefruit
color
and
fair
head
retention
and
fair
lacing
the
flavors
are
also
dominated
by
berry
sweetness
and
tartness
leaving
a
hint
of
wheat
malt
bready
estery
flavors
to
fight
through
late
moderately
full
body
with
a
thinning
tartness
and
mild
astringency
if
the
finish
i
like
the
beer
but
it
is
not
as
subtley
flavored
as
purple
haze
and
many
other
raspberry
wheats
i
will
keep
exploring
this
genre
as
i
feel
it
could
be
great
however
this
is
more
a
beer
for
your
girlfriends
who
want
a
lighter
fruity
beer
probably
the
best
raspberry
beer
ive
tasted
easy
to
drink
while
not
being
too
overly
sweet
this
is
one
adventure
i
am
glad
i
went
on
when
first
trying
this
i
was
skeptical
after
trying
many
other
fruit
flavored
beers
and
being
highly
disappointed
this
was
the
saving
grace
for
flavored
beer
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
is
too
fruity
to
drink
a
lot
of
pours
and
smells
like
it
should
be
very
flavorful
but
the
taste
was
like
weak
raspberry
flavored
soda
water
i
do
not
usually
like
these
flavored
wheats
but
i
gave
it
a
shot
considering
it
was
new
to
the
area
and
i
enjoy
most
of
what
harpoon
brews
unfortantly
i
could
not
even
finish
it
maybe
just
not
my
style
poured
a
hazy
pinkgold
color
with
a
decent
head
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
full
of
real
raspberry
scents
in
many
of
these
summer
fruit
beers
it
just
tastes
like
fruit
was
added
to
a
basic
beer
but
this
one
works
well
the
raspberry
flavor
compliments
the
beer
well
creating
an
insanely
crisp
and
refreshing
drink
the
mouth
is
thin
to
moderate
this
blows
the
regular
ufowhich
i
find
to
be
quite
bland
away
i
was
actually
looking
forward
to
trying
this
as
i
got
it
as
a
free
sample
from
a
friend
i
always
enjoyed
the
regular
ufo
so
the
addition
of
the
raspberries
made
it
interesting
to
grab
my
attention
unfortunately
it
failed
to
win
over
my
tastebuds
as
well
appears
an
amber
clouded
opaque
tone
with
a
largely
formed
rough
textured
head
sticks
around
for
awhile
forms
sporadic
chunks
of
lacing
as
it
dwindles
the
color
is
an
off
white
hue
with
a
pinkish
tint
to
it
aromatics
contain
tart
raspberry
with
a
mild
citrus
sharp
sweet
note
coming
about
with
a
bready
biscuit
malt
presence
along
with
those
mildly
acidic
wheat
notes
yeast
tone
gives
it
a
funky
mix
as
well
flavors
blend
decently
because
the
brew
doesnt
show
off
any
sugary
sweet
concentrate
kinda
of
like
a
nice
tart
raspberry
puree
here
with
the
yeast
wheat
and
malt
components
leveling
out
the
vibe
a
bit
i
actually
dig
this
more
than
the
ufo
hefeweizen
still
no
clove
and
banana
action
bc
this
is
an
american
wheat
but
it
does
the
trick
in
delivering
a
fruit
beer
without
candy
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
the
back
of
the
throat
with
each
sip
overall
not
something
that
seems
like
a
smooth
sipping
brew
drinkability
for
me
i
couldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
and
i
wouldnt
necessarily
crave
another
one
i
could
see
how
people
afraid
of
craft
brews
could
find
comfort
in
something
like
this
this
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
like
raspberries
as
expected
the
aroma
is
strong
and
full
of
raspberry
aroma
theres
not
much
to
indicate
that
its
a
hefeweizen
taste
is
a
different
matter
though
as
it
starts
to
blossom
as
a
hefeweizen
with
strong
raspberry
overtones
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
though
and
doesnt
have
the
consistency
of
cough
syrup
or
nothing
like
that
not
too
sweet
either
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
think
the
fruit
beer
balance
was
right
on
but
the
raspberry
flavor
was
off
smell
was
of
sharp
sour
raspberries
with
some
doughy
aspects
taste
had
nice
malt
notes
along
with
some
good
bitter
hops
presence
the
raspberry
however
was
sharp
and
oily
it
reminded
my
of
accidentally
fermented
berries
or
maybe
a
raspberry
seed
extract
im
eager
to
try
the
normal
ufo
to
compare
but
the
flavor
of
this
one
was
not
what
i
wanted
my
wifes
new
favorite
beer
i
cant
share
her
enthusiasm
its
a
hazy
redorange
color
with
a
small
head
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
a
little
grain
the
raspberry
flavor
is
there
but
it
tastes
artificial
a
little
malt
as
well
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
a
plain
hefe
solid
offering
i
recommend
trying
it
at
least
twice
since
this
is
the
first
hot
day
in
quite
some
time
here
in
boston
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
and
refreshing
i
gotta
say
im
not
such
a
fan
of
the
regular
ufo
offering
but
maybe
the
raspberry
aspect
will
spruce
it
up
a
bit
it
poured
into
a
magic
hat
hocus
pocus
weizen
glass
a
pale
somewhat
murky
light
pink
heading
was
thin
and
minimal
but
not
altogether
unappealing
looking
in
the
aroma
were
light
sweet
raspberries
a
bit
of
lime
very
similar
to
how
a
fruit
flavored
gingerale
smells
the
raspberries
become
a
bit
more
tart
when
tasting
with
some
green
leaf
flavors
more
citrus
notes
and
maybe
a
bit
of
watermelon
mouthfeel
was
light
crisp
and
very
refreshing
i
could
definitely
make
a
session
with
this
beer
especially
on
hot
days
like
today
this
might
not
be
the
best
fruit
brew
ive
tasted
but
its
a
solid
offering
recommended
drinkability
good
summer
brew
i
really
liked
the
harpoon
ufo
offering
and
decided
to
try
this
one
i
was
not
disappointed
ill
keep
this
in
my
frige
this
summer
for
a
nice
refreshing
offering
overall
not
bad
if
you
drink
only
1
very
drinkable
but
more
like
a
soda
in
my
opinion
especially
with
the
heavy
carbonation
this
one
is
enjoyable
certainly
more
enjoyable
than
i
was
expecting
its
got
flavour
and
is
well
balanced
and
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
i
dont
know
that
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
could
easily
have
this
one
again
try
it
i
will
never
drink
one
of
these
again
the
taste
is
way
too
sour
and
fizzy
for
my
liking
i
dont
mind
a
fruit
beer
every
once
and
a
while
but
the
raspberry
syrup
is
too
much
to
overcome
there
is
a
slight
wheat
or
bread
flavor
but
again
its
soured
by
the
sodalike
syrup
and
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
way
too
thin
for
a
hefe
ill
be
honest
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
beer
i
wouldnt
even
recommend
it
to
fruit
beer
fans
go
with
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
if
you
must
poured
a
rich
hazy
raspberry
tinted
pale
with
a
great
hefe
head
that
even
had
just
the
slightest
raspberry
red
tint
to
it
the
aroma
was
strong
on
raspberries
and
not
much
else
the
taste
was
also
strong
on
raspberries
but
of
course
had
the
typical
characteristics
of
a
hefeweizen
behind
it
the
beer
was
good
and
carbonated
as
a
hefe
should
be
this
was
quite
enjoyable
as
my
taste
for
wheat
beers
grows
with
spring
coming
back
in
bloom
d
nowhere
near
as
tasty
as
the
original
ufo
didnt
go
down
very
easily
for
me
not
very
filling
everything
ive
had
from
harpoon
so
far
has
been
at
least
decent
and
some
have
been
very
good
however
i
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
pours
a
cloudy
peach
pink
color
with
a
three
finger
light
pinkish
head
with
some
lacing
to
the
finish
nice
raspberry
aroma
hit
you
even
as
you
pour
it
nice
tartness
to
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
crisp
light
refreshing
dry
i
was
very
leery
about
trying
this
beer
but
found
it
very
good
i
think
for
a
summer
time
refresher
it
would
be
just
great
and
i
really
liked
the
way
it
looked
in
the
glass
this
beer
is
as
bad
as
rex
grossman
which
this
gentleman
grossman
cost
me
some
cash
poured
a
pinkish
light
red
color
the
smell
was
fruit
raspberry
strawberry
nice
head
smell
of
life
savers
crystal
light
taste
was
bland
boring
and
blah
it
was
better
than
the
ufo
rubbish
but
that
is
not
saying
much
the
taste
is
too
watery
for
me
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
to
me
i
tried
to
like
this
had
3
of
them
then
wrote
my
notes
gave
the
rest
to
the
lads
to
enjoy
they
still
like
drinking
the
coors
light
bud
light
swill
thans
to
rex
i
did
not
need
that
125
00
you
eejit
hold
on
to
the
ball
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
peachy
cloudy
color
with
a
very
small
bubbly
head
the
smell
is
definitely
of
raspberries
almost
wine
cooler
like
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
raspberries
with
the
malt
taste
being
almost
completely
hidden
and
a
very
light
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
downfall
of
the
drinkability
is
the
overpowering
sweetness
of
the
raspberries
otherwise
a
good
tasting
beer
preferably
in
small
amounts
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
light
budlike
head
that
rapidly
comes
and
goes
huge
carbonation
big
fat
bubbles
smells
like
raspberries
thats
about
it
maybe
a
hint
of
wheat
but
not
much
to
notice
taste
is
again
of
raspberries
and
not
much
else
except
for
a
funky
skunky
taste
in
the
finish
its
like
drinking
raspberry
seltzer
waterbeer
very
watery
and
very
carbonated
i
couldnt
finish
this
beer
not
even
close
i
had
to
hand
it
off
to
my
girlfriend
who
gladly
accepted
ill
pass
this
is
one
beer
that
is
safe
in
the
fridge
from
me
stealing
from
her
had
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
in
the
afternoon
after
my
classes
i
must
say
i
was
very
disappointed
it
poured
a
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
within
seconds
and
the
beer
itself
is
of
copperamber
color
there
was
a
good
scent
of
raspberries
but
not
as
good
as
i
would
have
predicted
the
taste
was
overwhelmingly
fruity
and
i
could
barely
taste
the
wheat
its
different
and
worth
a
shot
but
i
wont
be
having
another
one
of
these
anytime
soon
a
nice
above
average
beer
raspberry
aroma
and
taste
blend
for
a
nice
tart
summer
beer
enjoy
this
with
a
nice
piece
of
chocolate
cake
as
an
after
dinner
pairing
check
it
out
if
you
like
fruit
beers
da
this
is
a
nice
veryhot
day
style
beer
a
hazy
beer
for
a
hazy
summer
day
very
quenching
drinkability
low
the
fruit
is
too
much
cheers
a
hazey
golden
amber
beer
with
a
slight
pink
tint
has
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
lambic
lightly
fruity
sour
and
tart
the
raspberry
hits
the
tip
of
your
tongue
first
then
the
sour
tartness
takes
over
the
rest
the
sharp
tartness
on
the
finish
keeps
this
from
being
an
overly
sweet
fruit
beer
i
found
it
to
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
after
driving
home
from
work
having
a
six
of
this
in
the
fridge
just
to
have
something
refreshing
to
throw
down
your
throat
is
not
a
bad
idea
this
one
is
worth
a
trying
if
you
come
across
it
i
was
very
stunned
with
this
beer
at
first
it
tasted
like
a
malt
beverage
like
those
mike
drinks
but
as
it
went
down
each
sip
got
smoother
and
smoother
i
could
deffinetly
taste
the
wheat
in
it
but
it
just
had
this
nice
hint
of
raspberry
and
was
no
overbearing
while
still
maintaining
the
fact
that
it
is
a
beer
and
should
taste
like
one
very
well
done
overall
this
fails
due
to
the
flavor
seeming
artificial
this
is
a
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
i
definitely
enjoy
having
around
in
warm
weather
if
a
little
bit
of
a
gimmick
not
likely
to
drink
many
in
one
sitting
i
would
prefer
this
rather
than
berliner
weiss
with
added
raspberry
syrup
but
probably
not
as
much
or
as
often
as
a
high
quality
german
or
american
unfiltered
hefeweiss
with
a
slice
of
lemon
dropped
in
a
decent
fruit
beer
that
is
merely
lacking
in
substance
overall
the
beer
is
alright
and
i
would
imagine
that
it
would
be
a
popular
addition
to
any
backyard
bbq
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
but
i
would
take
long
trails
blackberry
wheat
over
the
ufo
raspberry
any
day
this
release
also
fills
a
gap
in
harpoons
portfolio
so
not
only
is
this
a
fun
release
for
fruit
beer
lovers
but
its
a
smart
one
highly
recommend
this
selection
for
those
hot
summer
days
ahead
lack
of
balance
in
flavor
haphazardly
thrown
together
that
comes
across
in
the
flavor
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
with
a
thin
head
thats
quick
to
fade
smell
is
straightahead
raspberries
carbonation
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
taste
is
tart
not
sweet
or
cloying
there
are
no
signs
of
the
usual
hefeweizen
lurking
in
the
background
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
jolly
rancher
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
would
probably
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
couldnt
make
it
a
session
beer
but
could
probably
have
a
couple
before
needing
to
move
on
to
something
else
the
alcohol
can
barely
be
discerned
while
drinking
this
and
there
isnt
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
accompany
the
taste
of
this
still
it
was
enjoyable
and
well
suited
to
someone
who
would
like
to
get
into
craft
beer
more
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
an
unfiltered
taste
but
this
brew
is
even
smoother
and
easier
to
enjoy
than
the
wheat
beers
of
recent
a
welcome
addition
to
my
spring
and
certainly
worth
a
try
for
a
wide
range
of
beer
enthusiasts
pours
a
reddishorange
with
a
white
foamy
head
smell
is
obvious
without
even
bringing
the
glass
to
your
nose
very
strong
raspberry
aroma
taste
is
also
very
fruity
refreshing
raspberry
flavor
with
subtle
wheat
and
yeast
flavors
in
the
background
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
especially
with
the
summer
coming
up
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
the
macro
drinker
to
something
with
some
character
d

very
drinkable
top
notch
fruit
beer
i
originally
picked
this
up
to
share
with
my
girlfriend
but
it
might
not
make
it
that
far
great
change
of
pace
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
due
to
the
fruits
acidity
but
thats
par
for
the
course
with
this
style
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
for
a
fruit
beer
its
not
where
id
go
first
but
i
imagine
that
fruit
beer
fans
would
really
enjoy
this
one
after
going
up
the
brewwery
over
a
month
ago
i
knew
a
rasberry
beer
was
soon
on
its
way
you
could
smell
it
everywhere
it
is
a
very
subdued
rasberry
flaovr
which
is
a
great
thing
not
to
fruity
with
no
real
aftertaste
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
however
i
think
i
still
like
the
original
ufo
better
with
some
lemon
it
is
definetly
worth
a
try
d
very
high
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
i
have
ever
had
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
of
abita
purple
haze
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
purple
haze
so
i
cant
express
a
preference
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
american
hefe
weizens
i
tend
to
prefer
the
fruity
and
spicy
flavors
present
in
german
hefes
i
think
the
raspberry
adds
some
of
what
i
feel
is
missing
from
the
american
style
as
such
i
prefer
ufo
raspberry
over
ufo
drinkabilitythe
drinkability
is
quite
high
i
saw
this
on
the
blackboard
at
the
bar
i
was
at
tonight
treydons
eho
ma
and
me
and
my
wife
split
the
bottle
not
knowing
what
to
expect
she
loves
it
definatly
a
summery
brew
picked
up
a
6er
at
the
grocery
store
on
the
way
home
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
a
cloudy
orange
rust
color
that
leaves
a
white
head
with
a
red
tint
that
is
frothy
and
bubbly
the
aroma
is
heavy
raspberry
tart
in
nature
almost
synthetic
the
taste
is
sweet
watery
raspberry
juice
it
continues
with
a
tartness
that
is
combined
with
a
somewhat
heavy
carbonated
wheat
feel
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
banana
nuts
almost
a
musty
taste
as
well
decent
hefe
could
be
great
with
more
real
raspberry
presence
in
the
body
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
another
great
harpoon
beer
damn
massachusetts
makes
great
beer
now
i
know
some
people
say
that
it
tastes
like
cough
syrup
well
i
say
so
what
are
you
expecting
fresh
fruit
in
a
bottle
of
beer
im
not
when
i
buy
a
fruit
beer
im
not
buying
it
and
expecting
to
have
to
pick
seeds
out
of
my
teeth
okay
enough
of
my
tangent
this
beer
was
very
tasty
for
anyone
who
likes
raspberry
78s
sam
adams
cranberry
lambic
18
dogfish
head
fort
a
nice
little
drinkable
fruit
beer
but
honestly
it
just
seemed
like
ufo
with
some
sugary
fruit
syrup
tossed
in
pours
faintly
pink
with
no
descernable
head
to
block
the
coloring
but
has
an
enourmous
scent
of
fresh
raspberries
maintains
its
wheaty
characteristics
and
flavoring
while
adding
an
almost
sweet
fruity
punch
the
finish
does
not
linger
but
thats
okayyou
dont
want
it
to
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
i
could
see
pounding
down
several
of
when
it
gets
a
little
warmer
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
once
the
summer
comes
but
i
cannot
see
myself
having
a
very
long
seesion
with
the
beer
rather
using
it
as
a
paring
with
certain
foods
or
having
one
just
as
a
change
of
pace
pours
a
twofingered
white
head
that
quicky
fades
leaving
traces
of
lace
cloudy
redamber
color
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
raspberry
nose
starts
nondescript
but
then
the
sweet
raspberry
flavor
kicks
in
and
leaves
a
lingering
raspberry
aftertaste
1
25
for
a
12
oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
nice
drinkability
level
overall
and
a
beer
that
will
only
become
more
desirable
as
summer
and
hot
weather
approaches
something
tells
me
this
beer
will
be
a
success
with
the
female
beer
drinking
population
worth
checking
out
i
lucked
out
with
such
a
fresh
sample
d
easy
to
drink
i
can
see
this
being
a
summer
cookout
beer
or
a
easy
choice
at
a
party
where
the
drink
of
choice
is
typically
more
mainstream
d
i
certainly
could
not
make
a
session
out
of
this
beer
but
that
is
only
because
i
am
not
into
fruit
beers
this
will
be
around
in
my
fridge
through
the
spring
and
summer
as
an
alternative
guest
pleaser
and
to
pair
with
food
i
could
easily
see
cooking
with
this
in
all
sorts
of
way
as
well
salads
beer
braised
chicken
quarters
or
even
a
lean
medium
rare
pork
loin
