its
not
a
beer
that
will
be
a
showstopper
and
i
would
say
even
the
stylistic
execution
could
be
finetuned
for
some
improvement
this
is
a
bit
minerally
and
a
bit
overly
earthy
but
overall
it
is
well
balanced
and
perfectly
sessionable
while
delivering
a
a
really
nice
malty
flavour
with
hints
of
the
hops
and
english
yeast
mild
and
unassuming
this
makes
a
pretty
solid
session
offering
really
pleasant
dark
beer
with
a
smooth
malty
taste
according
to
the
brewerys
web
site
hvd
won
gold
medals
at
both
the
2008
canadian
and
2008
ontario
brewing
awards
overall
a
fine
brew
that
is
well
balanced
and
wellrepresentative
of
the
style
an
obvious
fairly
local
comparison
is
the
neustadt
10w30
and
both
stand
up
after
further
scrutiny
as
being
really
solid
beers
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
a
bit
more
mainly
due
to
its
pungent
aromatics
but
both
are
and
enjoyable
and
affordable
interpretation
of
the
style
extremely
impressed
by
this
for
its
large
flavor
and
creamy
body
some
cross
off
crazy
porter
brown
ale
with
light
mild
character
fantastic
stuff
oustanding
smooth
dark
mild
a
quaffable
and
wellbalanced
interpretation
of
the
style
o
drinkable
but
in
part
because
its
a
on
the
light
side
not
a
beer
i
buy
often
but
one
i
always
enjoy
and
would
recommend
to
any
fan
of
north
american
takes
on
british
ales
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
light
body
good
carbonation
final
thoughts
when
i
think
of
english
brown
ales
new
castle
comes
to
mind
while
hockley
dark
is
in
that
same
grain
it
offers
slightly
less
sweetness
and
a
little
more
roughness
on
the
palate
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
another
good
beer
from
hockley
i
find
it
shares
similar
characteristics
to
their
black
tan
this
dark
ale
may
have
been
used
in
that
this
beer
isnt
spectacular
but
definitely
above
average
overall
impression
was
something
of
a
dark
english
mild
mellow
but
with
full
bodied
roastcoffee
flavors
aroma
was
soft
and
mild
but
carried
some
notes
of
dark
roast
and
mild
coffee
dark
in
the
glass
but
a
light
brown
when
poured
from
the
can
flavors
were
full
and
lightly
roasty
with
some
coffee
and
cocoa
impressions
a
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
from
the
roast
overall
smooth
and
malty
a
good
beer
id
seek
out
while
in
ontario
hopefully
on
cask
or
draft
final
grade
3
62
a
b
overall
alright
is
the
only
word
that
comes
to
mind
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
easily
drinkable
and
a
solid
dark
ale
overall
i
always
suspected
this
to
be
a
stout
though
its
actually
a
well
crafted
mild
brown
certainly
more
english
as
is
found
in
plenty
of
ontario
breweries
beers
i
found
it
drinkable
but
not
really
something
i
will
pick
up
often
which
is
unfortunate
seeing
as
its
the
local
brewery
in
a
small
town
od
hockley
seems
to
make
some
quality
classic
styles
easy
drinking
flavourful
and
interesting
the
rich
malt
character
is
appropriate
for
the
cooler
weather
these
days
i
like
it
m
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
o
another
decent
easy
drinking
brew
by
hockley
not
overly
complex
however
it
does
not
claim
to
be
not
bad
but
not
enough
body
to
back
up
the
pungent
smell
pretty
easy
drinking
and
would
make
a
good
steak
and
potatoes
accent
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
minimal
white
head
around
the
edges
smell
is
dark
fruit
and
raisin
with
roasted
malt
though
the
roasted
character
is
quite
minimal
and
imo
not
as
upfront
as
it
should
be
faint
notes
of
alcohol
come
and
go
roasted
malt
light
astringent
notes
chocolate
and
coffee
take
shape
and
battle
it
out
and
is
really
apparent
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
along
with
a
roasty
smoke
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
here
light
feel
but
medium
body
not
bad
overall
finishes
stronger
than
how
it
starts
solid
english
style
dark
ale
definitely
my
favourite
of
their
offerings
so
far
d
very
sessionable
though
thats
in
part
because
its
rather
light
for
a
brown
ale
hockley
describes
it
as
a
cross
between
the
northern
brown
ale
and
the
midlands
mild
id
say
its
quite
an
enjoyable
twist
on
the
style
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
one
complaint
i
have
is
that
its
a
bit
light
on
hockleys
website
they
say
they
tweaked
the
body
slightly
to
give
it
a
lighter
more
north
american
appeal
i
wish
it
had
a
fuller
body
and
taste
the
light
body
keeps
making
you
come
back
for
more
to
make
up
for
the
lightness
and
you
end
up
finishing
the
can
rather
quickly
overall
still
a
good
beer
drink
the
beer
really
does
have
a
nice
appearance
and
it
is
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
definitely
session
this
one
and
im
happy
i
tried
it
quite
light
really
moderate
carbonation
very
sessionable
also
from
the
can
mild
light
body
full
flavour
and
proudly
craft
brewed
in
ontario
canada
canadian
canned
beer
can
you
dig
it
dpretty
drinkable
not
much
to
it
imo
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
that
starts
off
with
thick
white
head
head
dissipates
and
leaves
a
small
ring
with
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
bready
malts
with
some
sweet
fruit
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
carbonation
level
is
good
with
smooth
mouthfeel
though
maybe
a
little
bit
thin
body
an
ok
beer
for
the
style
d
not
overly
drinkable
pretty
much
every
english
beer
should
be
a
session
beer
so
a
little
disappointing
here
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bit
lower
alcohol
on
this
which
would
be
true
to
style
although
it
fits
in
the
northern
english
brown
category
edit
crap
i
got
it
in
a
can
not
a
bottle
d
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
flavours
are
balanced
well
could
probably
enjoy
a
few
of
these
but
not
a
full
session
d
i
would
have
no
problem
having
a
few
pints
of
this
over
the
course
of
an
evening
a
perfect
session
beer
but
would
also
be
nice
with
food
i
recommend
this
brew
for
any
beer
drinker
and
think
it
would
be
a
good
way
to
get
into
a
darker
beer
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
savoury
and
crisp
british
bitter
notes
a
prime
candidate
for
sessioning
no
matter
where
you
are
in
this
broadly
spanning
country
of
ours
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
all
together
just
a
well
made
english
brown
doesnt
stray
from
the
style
and
doesnt
come
up
short
either
eta
im
just
noticing
that
the
lowest
grade
for
this
beer
is
a
b
and
the
highest
is
a
b
i
guess
the
next
step
is
to
work
out
if
being
consistently
above
average
and
just
below
excellence
right
across
the
board
is
necessarily
something
to
be
proud
of
whatever
the
case
it
seems
at
least
somewhat
remarkable
to
have
this
much
of
a
consensus
with
not
a
single
champion
or
detractor
in
the
midst
a
very
drinkable
ontario
dark
one
of
the
better
ones
available
on
the
market
the
taste
could
have
been
a
bit
fuller
and
im
confused
about
the
lack
of
head
but
still
ill
get
this
one
again
maybe
hockely
ships
the
whoops
the
brewmaster
slept
in
brew
in
cans
to
alberta
the
land
of
bud
light
etc
this
was
too
meek
in
every
aspect
the
brewery
does
not
apologize
this
believing
that
their
original
recipe
had
to
be
tweaked
to
give
it
a
lighter
appeal
no
bad
idea
hockley
valley
i
think
you
might
have
gotten
things
backwards
this
needs
to
be
heavier
if
it
were
just
that
little
bit
more
malty
and
just
that
little
bit
less
plain
it
might
just
be
an
outstanding
beer
as
it
is
im
tweaking
my
scores
to
reflect
a
lighter
amusement
i
will
drink
this
again
for
the
price
its
a
pretty
good
value
d
quite
good
as
long
as
it
does
not
warm
up
too
much
or
becomes
flat
obviously
this
is
more
of
a
session
beer
than
a
beer
to
be
savoured
for
too
long
m
this
is
what
hurts
this
good
tasting
beer
its
thin
like
a
watery
syrup
once
it
goes
flat
i
hope
future
batches
are
better
coffee
flavours
with
a
slight
caramel
followed
by
a
very
light
flavouring
and
a
very
strong
carbonation
reminding
me
of
7up
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
doubt
i
would
buy
this
one
again
but
cant
say
it
was
bad
enough
that
i
didnt
finish
it
a
pretty
good
browndark
ale
id
consider
buying
it
again
if
i
wanted
something
in
the
style
a
very
sessionable
brown
ale
good
balance
of
flavor
another
nice
suprise
from
a
can
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
very
well
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
mild
yes
light
bodied
yes
full
flavoured
not
so
much
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
was
that
it
seemed
too
watered
down
there
is
plenty
of
room
to
pack
some
more
malt
and
chocolate
into
the
taste
nicer
head
retention
would
have
been
nice
too
nonetheless
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
if
offered
this
was
a
decent
beer
by
no
means
my
favourite
but
i
can
see
why
it
was
the
overall
winner
i
vastly
preferred
the
corporals
bitter
brown
but
the
high
hopping
of
that
brew
made
for
a
lovehate
experience
the
hockley
on
the
other
hand
had
a
pleasant
balance
of
flavours
that
made
for
excellent
sessionability
it
surprised
me
and
i
guess
thats
a
good
thing
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
that
id
actively
seek
out
but
much
better
than
many
offerings
at
the
lcbo
hockley
valley
dark
is
an
opportunity
lost
for
hvb
mc
well
maybe
not
quite
lost
but
unsure
how
to
get
home
and
too
proud
to
ask
for
directions
theres
definitely
some
potential
here
this
beer
has
a
smooth
but
thin
mouthfeel
overall
this
it
lacks
carbonation
more
complex
flavour
and
body
will
buy
again
i
tried
this
beer
on
june
7
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
very
dark
translucent
brown
with
some
reddish
hints
the
head
was
tan
coloured
and
lasted
the
aroma
was
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
toffee
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
creamy
with
a
sour
hint
the
flavour
was
roasted
malt
dry
cocoa
and
a
little
bit
of
sourness
and
bitterness
covering
the
tongue
definitely
drinkable
and
a
nice
brew
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
havent
had
enough
english
dark
ales
to
compare
it
with
although
i
quite
like
newcastle
but
ive
been
inspired
to
try
and
find
more
more
remeniscent
of
a
dark
ale
than
a
brown
yet
either
way
the
malts
still
rule
the
roost
on
this
one
good
dark
ale
with
plenty
of
drinkability
for
the
style
and
alcohol
at
first
glance
this
is
a
frightening
beer
its
the
colour
of
prune
juice
but
with
foam
on
top
i
dont
know
why
thats
the
image
i
got
other
than
talking
to
my
grandmother
before
trying
this
she
loves
prunes
fortunately
it
improves
from
there
smells
of
burnt
whole
grain
toast
milk
chocolatenot
dark
coffee
toffee
grass
and
a
bit
of
i
believe
brown
sugar
tastes
great
roasted
malts
and
coffee
dominate
blending
with
some
sweetened
chocolate
caramel
plums
figs
and
raw
earth
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
medium
body
definitely
a
good
beer
i
shall
buy
it
again
and
give
it
a
proper
review
hopefully
the
second
time
i
can
find
a
better
appearance
description
than
prune
juice
great
flavor
on
the
tongue
dark
fruits
molasses
the
hops
are
just
noticeable
but
play
there
part
leaving
behind
some
earthy
grass
essences
a
definite
go
to
session
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
with
as
long
as
youre
all
right
with
the
sweetness
of
it
ive
had
better
in
the
style
but
its
still
a
very
good
beer
santé
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
beige
head
lots
of
carbonation
going
on
here
in
the
body
though
looks
like
cola
aromas
are
faint
malt
coffee
smokey
and
caramel
tastes
like
coffee
balanced
with
some
sweet
malt
and
some
mild
nut
flavours
finish
is
smooth
leaving
a
nice
malt
aftertaste
well
done
a
lot
more
enjoyable
than
the
organic
lager
swingtop
liter
bottle
as
pictured
taped
seal
handdated
100506
i
brought
this
back
from
toronto
nice
puffy
colacolored
head
but
it
dissipates
quickly
aroma
contained
a
nice
light
mild
hop
aroma
slightly
malty
with
a
faint
hint
of
coffee
very
nice
ale
and
the
first
taste
on
the
palate
was
hops
but
was
wellcombined
with
the
malt
flavors
malt
was
light
in
body
but
present
good
mild
bitterness
blends
with
the
malt
to
the
finish
a
vigorous
froth
gives
a
nice
bittersaweet
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
ale
actually
quaffable
in
my
book
i
enjoy
this
one
quite
a
bit
it
goes
the
extra
distance
without
trying
to
be
too
explosive
or
too
showy
good
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
night
on
the
patio
a
very
well
rounded
offering
from
hockley
pours
out
to
a
deep
ruby
color
that
appears
coffee
black
medium
low
carbonation
small
head
of
brownish
white
foam
dissipated
rather
quickly
aromas
of
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
with
some
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
notes
a
touch
of
mild
bourbon
nice
taste
is
medium
bodied
and
very
enjoyable
roasted
malts
mild
chocolate
a
touch
of
sweet
grain
caramel
and
the
hops
are
even
noted
playing
a
well
founded
evening
role
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
touch
creamy
drinkability
is
rather
good
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
recommended
pours
a
deep
brown
with
plenty
of
ruby
highlights
and
a
well
formed
two
finger
head
that
lasts
well
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
smells
of
nuts
and
cocoa
with
a
pleasant
sweet
maltiness
and
just
a
touch
of
bittering
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
quite
full
with
more
roasted
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
accompanied
by
a
very
nice
nuttiness
and
a
kiss
of
hops
in
the
finish
which
is
nice
and
long
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
substantial
and
well
carbonated
as
well
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
very
good
session
ale
which
would
im
sure
become
a
staple
if
it
were
available
here
as
it
is
i
have
to
thank
pootz
for
this
very
appreciated
part
of
the
canbif2
package
i
rather
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
even
if
it
does
have
more
hop
presence
than
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
brown
ale
with
the
5
alcohol
lighter
body
and
fairly
balanced
flavour
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
d
a
very
nice
product
mouthfeel
is
good
a
slight
overcarbonation
to
the
brew
but
a
substantial
body
that
i
rather
enjoy
drinking
it
lacks
the
smoothness
of
an
oatmeal
stout
though
i
only
say
that
because
its
my
only
comparison
as
a
young
beer
advocate
but
still
very
good
i
dont
know
about
drinkability
i
doubt
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
without
feeling
a
little
icky
for
lack
of
a
better
word
but
as
an
occasional
thing
i
must
say
that
hockley
valley
dark
is
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
winner
surprisingly
delicious
looks
like
a
fine
pint
of
stout
smells
absolutely
amazing
hints
of
berries
and
mocha
and
something
that
somewhat
resembles
chicory
taste
has
hints
of
mocha
a
slight
astringent
and
an
aftertaste
that
is
of
lightly
roasted
grains
mouthfeel
is
bold
slightly
carbonsated
quite
nice
pretty
drinkable
pretty
heavy
not
a
session
beer
but
makes
for
an
excellent
afterdinner
apertif
love
those
ontario
craft
breweries
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
british
or
irish
style
beers
somewhat
like
guiness
but
since
guiness
isnt
for
everyone
this
goes
down
easily
without
a
strong
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
pleasant
my
favourite
aspect
of
this
beer
hockley
valley
dark
is
pleasantly
bitter
and
goes
great
with
salty
food
i
had
mine
with
fried
ham
and
home
fries
yum
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
color
ale
with
nice
foamy
dark
brown
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
english
malt
with
floral
undertone
is
easily
distinguishable
taste
is
very
refreshing
wit
a
good
roasted
malt
presence
and
a
bitter
finish
with
a
good
balance
of
what
seems
like
english
hops
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
worth
trying
its
got
lots
of
flavor
but
could
use
a
little
more
body
pours
a
super
dark
brown
medium
tan
head
no
carbonation
the
nose
was
decent
some
nice
roasted
malts
a
pinch
of
coffee
and
cocoa
taste
was
mild
up
front
the
roasted
malts
seemed
to
peak
through
nicely
midsip
and
lingered
quite
well
although
subtle
again
i
found
some
traces
of
cocoa
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
light
and
smooth
a
pleasant
warmth
to
the
beer
i
found
that
the
flavours
of
this
beer
seemed
more
pronounced
long
after
a
sip
had
been
swallowed
it
grew
on
me
as
i
progressed
through
the
glass
nice
drinkability
smooth
light
bodied
but
warm
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
very
drinkable
comfortable
to
drink
but
not
especially
exciting
nothing
really
to
make
me
want
to
go
out
and
buy
this
one
again
im
afraid
just
picked
this
one
up
at
the
lcbo
quite
an
attractive
bottle
poured
out
of
1l
growler
beer
was
a
rich
dark
reddish
brown
with
lots
of
whitish
head
i
have
a
cold
so
it
didnt
really
smell
like
much
as
little
hoppy
and
metallic
though
the
taste
was
a
little
too
light
as
well
but
a
bitter
nutty
flavour
and
a
little
chocolate
were
present
however
the
taste
did
get
better
with
every
sip
the
mouthfeel
was
too
light
for
me
seemed
watered
down
altogether
an
average
beer
i
thought
it
has
high
drinkability
but
is
pretty
pricey
to
buy
on
a
regular
basis
worth
a
try
though
i
thought
it
was
pretty
decent
a
decent
microbrew
somewhat
of
an
experiment
to
juice
up
an
ordinary
dark
beer
that
works
carbonation
was
cheap
and
on
less
pleasant
and
less
drinkable
side
bit
novice
beer
drinkers
i
shared
this
large
minimum
magnum
with
went
with
the
cocoa
and
carmel

to
scoot
in
to
the
hockley
brewery
with
some
lovely
winding
roads
the
floppin
crappie
is
a
nice
sessionable
beer
the
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
there
is
not
much
scent
to
this
beer
subtle
hints
of
sweet
malt
that
is
about
it
the
taste
is
a
very
even
balanced
beer
the
malt
provides
a
sweet
back
drop
and
there
is
enough
bittering
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
to
make
it
very
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
a
wonderfully
delicious
treat
that
may
make
you
flop
like
a
crappie
after
your
first
6pack
a
delightful
change
to
your
regular
beer
or
a
viable
option
if
you
are
looking
for
a
new
daily
drinker
dont
be
surprised
if
you
are
throwing
pows

just
a
couple

considering
the

not

m
still
seems
somewhat
thin
but
thats
actually
appropriate
for
the
style
this
time
and
for
once
the
carbonation
is
actually
adequate
on
the
palate
despite
the
disappointing
head
a
very
maltforward
brewa
whole
lot
going
on
here
with
a
very
complex
layered
character
that
reveals
something
new
sip
after
sip
as
it
warms
up
sometimes
subtle
beers
can
bring
more
to
the
table
even
at
a
lower
abv
that
said
it
is
is
without
a
doubt
sessionable
i
like
the
idea
of
their
beerall
of
them
are
northwoodsy
like
central
waters
but
i
understand
the
brewery
is
actually
a
brewpub
with
not
a
lot
of
outside
distribution
maybe
if
i
went
to
the
restaurant
there
or
maybe
if
i
tried
others
i
could
get
a
better
appraisal
light
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
time
to
move
on
to
something
better
hahahaha
wow
this
is
a
first
a
beer
whose
flavor
and
aroma
are
so
subtle
that
i
cant
taste
them
now
i
will
admit
i
do
have
some
allergysinus
problems
but
until
this
beer
this
evening
ive
been
able
to
taste
and
smell
the
others
its
extra
weird
because
i
have
the
feeling
that
the
tastes
and
smells
are
almost
there
but
not
i
did
let
the
beer
warm
a
bit
and
still
wait
just
now
i
tasted
some
malt
hurrah
the
scores
i
gave
for
taste
and
smell
are
where
they
are
since
i
tasted
nothing
bad
or
out
of
character
and
now
i
did
pick
up
a
little
malt
pouring
aggressively
gave
me
some
off
white
head
that
quickly
died
down
and
no
lace
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
color
is
an
almost
clear
nice
medium
dark
honey
amber
with
some
tiny
bubble
trails
finish
is
ah
very
faint
and
so
short
fleeting
flavors
of
toasted
malt
seemingly
the
dominant
taste
characteristic
which
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
again
a
hint
of
molasses
sweetness
bare
hint
of
maltiness
in
the
mellow
aftertaste
feel
is
a
bit
flaccid
and
bland
which
puts
a
damper
on
the
overall
impression
despite
its
decent
flavor
smell
and
appearance
better
than
the
other
northwoods
beers
so
far
a
simple
clean
utilitarian
amber
ale
with
no
flaws
other
than
its
dull
mouthfeel
tailormade
for
taking
cans
out
on
the
lake
fishing
ah
the
crack
glug
i
miss
the
auditory
nature
of
my
beer
cansumption
when
it
is
any
other
serving
style
bottles
boring
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
rapidly
falling
deeptan
head
color
was
a
cpperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
light
malty
sweetness
underlain
with
a
slight
metallic
tang
no
not
from
the
can
but
more
likely
the
water
they
used
interacting
with
the
hops
better
living
through
chemistry
kids
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
muted
caramel
sweetness
in
the
mouth
finish
was
equally
hohum
like
they
were
afraid
to
let
the
reins
out
when
they
brewed
this
beer
it
needed
more
ooomph
i
would
not
seek
it
out
but
if
i
were
in
the
north
woods
of
wisco
i
would
not
pass
it
up
either
o
pretty
mediocre
brew
but
it
was
nice
to
have
it
again
after
having
my
fair
share
in
college
it
was
a
nice
gift
with
some
thought
behind
it
from
a
world
class

and
mildly
astringent

up

comes
on
before

even
a

of
sweetness
grainy
bready
finish
with
residual
mineral
water
bitterness
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
fizzy
feel
better
than
a
lot
of
canned
macro
beer
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
needs
more
complexity
and
freshness
oh
and
some
more
hop
presence
would
help
too
this
is
a
nonfrills
basic
rendition
of
an
amber
ale
theres
nothing
particularly
interesting
but
it
has
no
glaring
flaws
is
generally
tasty
and
easy
enough
to
drink
cheers
d
decent
the
bland
bitterness
doesnt
leave
you
begging
for
more
ounces
but
definitely
not
hard
to
drink
by
any
means
the
beer
drinks
well
enough
its
nothing
outstanding
nor
is
it
terrible
which
leaves
it
around
the
average
mark
pours
out

slightly
muddled

colour
thin
wispy

and

sweet

ghostly
mint
and

like
notes
rather
uninspired
flavours
of

with
a
strange
hop
flavour
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
if
there
is
any
wheat
in
here
its
hard
to
detect
this
really
doesnt
taste
all
that
good
flat
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
drinkability
isnt
all
that
good
not
impressed
good
drinkability
decent
beer
overall
this
wasnt
unpleasant
to
drink
but
it
fell
flat
lacking
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
departments
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
but
could
use
a
bit
more
heft
could
be
a
session
beer
but
i
would
reach
for
something
with
a
little
bolder
taste
profile
i
see
it
won
a
silver
medal
at
the
sturgis
beer
fest
d
this
is
an
average
ale
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
it
has
some
character
this
is
a
strange
one
but
is
somewhat
drinkable
for
this
fan
of
golden
toasted
marshmallows
recommended
for
the
crappie
fisherman
for
the
novelty
if
nothing
else
there
are
many
more
interesting
and
beerlike
options
available
in
wisconsins

drinkability
one
of
the
most
aptly
names
beers
ive
ever
come
across
bonus
points
for
honesty
originally
reviewed
april

2005
on
tap
at
the
gitchee
gumee
brewfest
2005
this
is
like
a
watered
down
burnt
toast
version
of
their
bumblin
bubba
yet
it
has
even
less
complexity
and
pleasentness
vague
sweetness
hints
of
cheap
caramel
and
a
fleeting
ghost
of
honey
light
off
notes
mark
the
finish
not
a
real
drinker
makes
me
wonder
if
they
had
crappies
in
the
tanks
prior
to
filtraton
almost
tastes
like
it
no
no
thats
mean
to
the
fish
i
take
it
back
lighter
medium
body
super
quick
and
easy
not
quite
watery
thin
overall
but
has
a
nice
crispness
to
it
but
lacks
an
ok
drinker
to
a
bit
boring
a
little
darker
in
color
than
i
expected
and
there
was
a
very
light
maltiness
to
it
but
overall
it
was
devoid
of
taste
and
aroma
a
beer
for
the
bud
light
drinkers
apparently
actually
most
of
their
10beer
menu
seemed
to
be
dumbed
down
for
crossover
drinkers
served
on
draft
at
northwoods
described
by
northwoods
as
a
wheat
looks
more
like
a
light
amber
malt
shows
a
hint
a
caramel
roast
and
we
start
getting
into
more
noticeable
hops
a
clean
finish
more
like
a
red
ale
not
much
in
the
way
of
wheat
taste
but
pretty
nice
if
you
to
try
this
beer
though
go
to
northwoods
and
drink
it
there
dont
take
any
bottles
home
as
they
seem
to
be
having
trouble
with
their
bottling
one
of
my
favourite
brews
to
date
and
its
a
local
beer
for
me
black
pours
a
thin
offwhite
head
smell
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
choc
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
real
dry
finish
like
cooking
chocolate
low
carbonation
feels
very
watery
ok
if
you
are
after
a
mid
strength
dark
ale
food
match
stew
or
shepherds
pie
would
pair
well
o
enjoyable
and
flavorful
beer
for
the
style
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
fairly
low
levels
of
carbonation
the
result
is
a
smooth
flowing
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
avoid
being
stagnant
closes
fairly
dry
with
small
amounts
of
lingering
stickiness
on
the
palate
overall
a
well
put
together
beer
but
far
too
mild
in
flavour
for
me
a
low
alcohol
content
but
is
quite
flavourful
and
pretty
wellbalanced
there
is
a
nice
earthy
base
and
a
pleasant
feel
with
some
nice
caramel
and
fruit
flavours
throughout
o
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
considering
the
lightness
of
body
and
low
abv
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
recommend
it
to
others
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
good
complexitydepth
to
the
flavor
and
the
smell
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to

its

and
low

content
but
is
surprisingly
very
flavorful
just
like
other

overall
a
very
good
beer
i
could
drink
gallons
of
it
o
my
first
introduction
to
the
mild
style
but
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
i
was
worried
about
its
age
but
it
has
done
well
in
the
time
since
it
was
brewed
poured
into

light
suggestions
of

and

flavor
is

but

light

i
was
facing
this
ale
with
some
trepidation
because
of
the
abv
but
i
am
quite
pleased
at
the
eveness
and
flavor
combination
of
this
ale
im
really
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
style
easy
drinking
the
full
flavor
warms
well
with
a
low
abv
this
is
a
classic
afternoon
session
beer
for
a
lazy
day
with
friends
or
alone
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
cant
believe
its
the
first
of
the
style
ive
reviewed
and
one
of
the
few
ive
tried
though
its
not
as
widely
an
attempted
style
as
many
taste
notes
the
upfront
taste
is
pure
roasted
caramel
with
no
hops
presence
at
all
then
this
aftertaste
creeps
in
which
reminds
me
of
potting
soil
or
old
coffee
grounds
now
this
may
sound
disgusting
but
actually
it
is
beguiling
to
say
the
least
there
is
an
old
cottage
in
the
forest
about
this
that
just
tickles
me
this
is
unlike
any
other
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
i
hope
to
drink
more
of
this
bewitching
brew

i
bought
a

and
the
next
time
i
have
company
for
a
session
this
will
be
a
most
promising
starter
ale
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
worth
the
import
price5
unless
i
could
find
it
absolutely
fresh
so
my
ignorant
opinion
is
thus
it
tastes
like
a
diluted
brown
ale
shrug
overall
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
at
3
4
percent
you
could
drink
a
good
few
of
these
with
some
good
conversation
and
still
enjoy
each
one
i
would
love
to
have
this

with

and
there
on

on
the
drink
down
smells

slight

and
some
roasty
notes
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
cold
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
that
fades
quickly
this
beer
has
very
light
carbonation
with
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
i
am
not
too
impressed
with
this
aspect
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
the
first
of
the
style
i
have
had
i
am
not
sure
if
the
mouthfeel
is
like
this
for
other
beers
of
the
style
but
i
am
not
too
fond
of
the
watery
aspect
pretty
solid
probably
a
million
times
better
on
cask
great
mild
overall
o
it
has
a
interesting
aroma
and
taste
with
a
nice
balance
on
the
hops
but
it
seems
a
bit
thin
and
could
better
if
it
had
a
thicker
body
this
beer
pours
a
cocacola
brown
in
color
with
red
highlights
once
fully
poured
it
resembles
a
dark
dark
brown
on
the
verge
of
black
with
a
one
finger
frothy
cream
colored
head
it
smells
of
lightly
roasted
malts
light
coffee
with
cream
and
possibly
even
espresso
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
frapuccino
and
it
tastes
like
an
iced
coffee
it
is
overly
drinkable
and
is
a
great
session
beer
fit
for
a
pub
it
drinks
light
to
medium
in
body
more
reminiscent
of
an
iced
coffee
which
is
fine
the
aftertaste
does
the
light
mouthfeel
some
justice
all
in
all
this
beer
was
pretty
impressive
its
hard
to
find
a
quality
session
beer
but
this
one
seems
to
pull
it
off
and
even
has
good
flavor
its
worth
a
try
o
my
american
senses
didnt
really
appreciate
this
mild
ale
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
but
it
was
mildaverage
in
nearly
every
sense
of
the
word
cheers
pours
rubytinged

quite

some
hints
of
coffee

there
to
really
nice
despite
not
being
overly
bold
flavours
are
more
roasty
but
still
light
and
mild
sot
much
caramel
but
still
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
towards
the
finish
great
moderate
carbonation
and
lightish
body
not
a
great
beer
but
a
long
way
from
being
a
bad
one
it
is
a
decent
beer
only
the
second
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
as
it
is
extremely
rare
d
could
easily
do
a
skixer
surprised
to
see
so
many
reviews
and
so
many
high
this
tells
me
the
best
of
english
milds
still
arent
getting
to
the
us
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
good
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
but
it
is
to
light
for
a
stout
or
porter
this
good
session
beer
as
some
subtle
depth
to
it
but
the
rich
flavor
is
the
many
player
light
in
body
and
really
roasty
ok
this
is
really
really
thin
its
like
cold
coffee
not
my
bag
but
i
guess
its
ok
d
highly
drinkable
each
sip
begs
another
i
poured
into
my
glass
to
a
thin
mocha
head
this
beer
is
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
aroma
is
milk
chocolate
and
bread
the
taste
is
milk
chocolate
and
finishes
with
some
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
the
abv
suggests
it
has
great
flavor
and
is
not
heavy
it
could
be
consumed
into
the
wee
hours
of
the
night
d
it
is
a
pretty
heavy
beer
but
fairly
low
in
alcohol
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
16oz
bottles
without
a
problem
although
i
am
reviewing
this
in
the
summer
i
feel
that
black
cat
better
suits
the
cold
winter
months
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
delivers
a
very
mild
plain
ale
some
sweeter
malty
flavors
tease
the
palate
briefly
a
vigorous
froth
releases
some
hop
bitterness
this
dark
ale
with
a
lower
abv
is
not
bringing
anything
spectacular
but
this
ale
does
taste
good
and
would
be
very
sessionable
would
also
be
thirst
quenching
possibly
fresh
on
tap
or
cask
in
england
would
have
a
little
more
oomph
solid
average
and
drinkable
with
a
desserty
taste
and
low
alcohol
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
that
impressive
looking
but
it
is
hard
to
believe
how
much
flavor
is
packed
into
such
a
low
abv
beer
what
head
did
form
quickly
faded
to
just
some
fine
bubbles
light
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
wonderful
aroma
of
chocolate
malt
and
fuggle
hops
classic
english
ale
aroma
that
i
absolutely
love
the
malt
and
hops
work
perfectly
together
in
the
flavor
as
well
notes
of
chocolate
with
some
herbs
and
earth
a
nice
body
for
such
a
light
beer
feels
much
stronger
than
what
it
is
a
beer
cannot
get
much
more
drinkable
than
this
a
relatively
harmless
abv
but
still
wonderfully
flavorful
american
brewers
could
learn
much
from
this
beer
deep
chestnut
color
some
head
and
lacing
not
much
aroma
wisemildly
metallic
and
tinge
of
sweet
caramel

aromas
very
solid
malty
flavor
again
a
trace
of
caramel
like
sweetness
just
enough
hop
bite
to
be
noticed
toasted
and
nutty
goodness
to
be
found
in
here
very
solid
mouthfeel
for
the
style
wowwhat
a
boat
load
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
the
brits
really
know
how
to
do
it
well
just
great
in
general
a
light
ale
thats
intended
to
be
served
on
cask
is
probably
not
best
represented
from
an
imported
bottle
solid
as
it
but
i
remain
more
optimisitc
about
it
in
the
homeland
overall
good
when
chilled
but
not
too
impressed
even
though
abv
was
low
rich
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
hues
in
the
light
nice
light
beige
head
retained
well
with
lovely
lacing
richly
malty
with
caramel
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
perhaps
a
touch
of
english
hops
as
well
as
far
as
taste
goes
this
is
probably
as
much
flavor
as
you
can
pack
into
a
very
low
abv
beer
rich
and
smooth
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
ample
bread
and
a
touch
of
bittering
in
the
finish
this
drinks
extremely
easily
but
will
probably
never
cause
your
palate
fatigue
wonderfully
sessionable
i
wish
i
had
the
whole
thing
to
myself
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
almost
black
as
tar
the
beer
poured
a
really
nice
frothy
tan
head
that
was
like
a
pillow
the
beer
had
a
beef
jerky
kinda
smoky
taste
it
was
too
bitter
though
and
watery
tasting
good
lacing
but
thats
it
i
will
buy
again
though
to
give
tis
one
another
chance
notes
a
lot
of
earthy
woody
and
nutty
flavors
that
are
a
little
bitter
this
is
balanced
with
a
very
slight
chocolate
caramel
malt
very
sessionable
beer
that
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
is
a
good
beer
to
just
drink
a
couple
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
smallish
soapy
tan
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
toffee
and
a
coffee
candy
almost
smells
like
kaluha
the
taste
is
of
coffee
with
mineral
water
added
to
water
it
down
the
coffee
flavor
is
nice
but
light
there
is
some
grain
flavors
with
toffee
sweetness
pretty
good
flavors
for
a
low
abv
brew
the
feel
is
very
light
and
water
with
fizzy
carbonation
almost
seems
like
i
am
drinking
carbonated
water
with
coffee
flavoring
drinks
very
easy
as
there
is
not
much
body
to
this
brew
i
can
see
why
these
are
session
brews
the
body
is
decent
crisp
carbonation
moderate
depth
flavors
of
mild
bittering
hops
lots
of
bittersweet
malts
a
light
sour
note
in
the
middle
and
a
faint
chocolate
finish
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
but
i
think
i
like
it
very
simple
but
full
of
flavor
and
character
nicely
done
towards
thin
though
grows
as
progresses
never
reaching
more
than
mediumbodied
at
most
even
after
slow
sipping
mildtomedium
carbonation
a
dry
roasted
aftertaste
lingers
drinkability
well
its
low
in
alcohol
so
certainly
one
could
drink
plenty
of
it
with
no
ill
effect
but
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
beer
that
really
inspired
me
to
reach
for
another
one
maybe
if
i
was
in
a
real
pub
and
this
was
from
a
cask
maybe
id
be
inspired
to
try
another
one
but
im
not
loving
it
not
bad
but
not
great
for
me
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
dont
feel
its
the
most
flavorful
but
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
makes
a
definite
session
beer
especially
considering
the
low
abv
of
3
4
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
appearance
is
dark
brown
to
black
but
a
little
more
transparent
than
i
would
like
as
a
result
the
beer
leaves
little
lasting
impression
in
the
mouth
and
the
flavours
do
not
last
beyond
the
initial
rush
d
low
alc
dark
and
very
flavorful
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
for
hours
on
end
sweet
soft
and
a
touch
dry
very
thin
in
body
but
remarkably
creamy
nevertheless
has
an
excellent
texture
in
the
mouth
that
holds
all
of
the
roasted
flavors
molasses
hops
and
earthiness
that
exudes
from
this
brew
interesting

structure
almost
sheetlike
on
the

the
roasted
caramel
and
sugary
malts
that
tastes
kind
of
like
a
smoked
schwartzbier
d
a
nice
dark
and
fruity
english
ale
a
good
dose
of
roasted
malt
makes
this
beer
seem
a
little
heavier
than
its
3
4
avb
but
it
is
still
appropriately
light
and
drinkable
this
is
a
great
session
beer
with
a
surprisingly
nice
brown
ale
flavor
this
is
a
little
beer
with
big
flavor
beers
with
this

on
cask
at
paradiso
pizza
in
georgetown
dc
its
got
a
slight
bitterness
that
i
didnt
expect
from
the
smell
the
peat
reappears
and
theres
a
sense
of
tobacco
not
too
bad
but
could
be
more
drinkable
as
it
has
a
bit
of
a
mineral
mouthfeel
to
it
that
really
dries
it
out
and
im
not
just
talking
about
the
finish
in
this
style
i
want
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
in
it
i
am
impressed
that
with
the
body
many
brewpubs
make
english
browns
too
watery
overall
this
is
wet
with
a
decent
aroma
that
doesnt
deliver
texture
and
taste
is
just
completely
lacking
even
for
a
mild
truly
tastes
like
peasants
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
average
english
mild
ale
i
thought
it
was
overcarbonated
and
a
bit
bland
in
the
taste
with
many
good
beers
out
there
by
olivers
this
isnt
one
to
really
seek
out
i
had
this
oncask
at
churchkey
in
dc
it
had
a
dark
redamber
colour
with
large
bubbles
and
a
good
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
sugary
with
a
hint
of
caramel
it
had
a
damp
and
musty
flavour
with
a
hint
of
honey
it
was
also
very
yeasty
the
finish
was
like
bitter
hop
water
i
didnt
really
like
it
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
on
the
nose
but
is
a
bit
boring
and
theres
still
a
bit
of
butter
in
there
some
light
roast
and
coffee
plus
a
touch
of
toffee
the
feel
is
quite
light
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
even
considering
the
serving
method
unfortunately
not
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
pratt
street
a
dark
amber
color
out
of
a
cask
and
i
expected
something
big
here
i
was
disappointed
i
didnt
pick
up
much
on
the
smell
side
besides
a
slight
malty
chocolate
i
identified
some
roasted
malts
on
the
first
sip
and
drank
this
one
pretty
fast
as
the
mouth
feel
was
smooth
and
refreshing
overall
im
always
a
bit
happier
when
a
good
mild
is
ontap
somewhere
and
so
needless
to
say
i
was
happy
at
pratt
st
worth
a
shot
low
body
bordering
on
medium
there
is
a
slight
roast
character
at
the
back
of
the
palate
but
its
kind
of
watery
up
front
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
english
mild
ales
but
this
is
about
what
i
expected
drinkability
is
high
there
really
isnt
anything
to
stand
in
your
way
so
to
speak
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
watery
feeling
in
the
front
is
completely
disconnected
with
the
back
a
unifying
flavor
or
more
carbonation
could
do
this
beer
wonders
maybe
its
better
on
draft
than
on
cask
it
was
fine
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
nice
full
offwhite
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
roastd

faint
coffee

and

notes
exceptional
flavor
follows

roasted

sweetness
present
medium

appropriate

another
excellent
real
ale
from
oliver
this

is
has
bigger
flavor
and
bigger
body
than
any
similar
brew
interesting
beer
drinkability
i
think
that
the
drinkability
is
good
the
abv
is
well
hidden
not
that
i
could
tell
as
i
dont
know
the
abv
and
the
flavors
are
pleasant

not
bad
but
not
good
either
this
is
the
third
beer
ive
tried
from
these
guys
aptly
named
a
nice
flavorful
beer
that
isnt
too
heavy
for
the
holidays
read
afternoon
football
drinking
not
a
ton
of
booze
which
helps
can
definitely
taste
the
toffee
and
rye
notes
tastes
are
reflected
in
the
nose
but
again
not
too
strong
decent
stuff
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
the
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
very
well
suited
to
the
style
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
mild
winter
is
a
deep
amberbrown
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
the
nose
is
sweet
with
amber
malt
burnt
chocolate
and
caramel
the
flavor
reflects
the
nose
nicely
with
the
roasty
characters
coming
to
the
forefront
coffee
and
burnt
chocolate
but
in
a
mild
nonacrid
way
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
light
yet
creamy
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
by
gi
i
could
definitely
drink
this
one
curled
up
next
to
a
fire
on
a
cold
winters
night
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
poundable
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
style
overall
an
american
attempt
at
an
english
bitter
and
i
think
goose
island
has
done
quite
well
hard
to
classify
this
one
but
it
is
a
tasty
beer
for
those
who
favor
the
englishstyle
ales
one
ill
certainly
look
for
again
and
for
the
record
it
still
holds
up
well
when
consumed
after
six
months
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
later

months

i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
do
not
like
the
ale
style
in
my
opinion
the
aftertaste
is
way
too
bitter
ive
had
ipa
before
that
i
did
not
mind
but
only
if
it
has
a
unique
flavor
i
e
coffee
etc
this
is
advertised
as
mild
which
was
very
strong
despite
the
label
in
my
opinion
would
not
try
again
or
recommend
unless
that
is
your
preference
i
didnt
really
sense
the
taste
of
the
caramel
advertised
in
the
description
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
pretty
good
as
its
not
too
strong
or
too
weak
its
slightly
sweet
with
malts
and
caramel
as
well
brown
sugar
it
has
a
little
bit
of
a
robust
taste
as
well
this
makes
for
a
pretty
good
winter
brew
very
well
balanced
beer
good
malt
character
and
the
rye
counters
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
nicely
fruitiness
adds
a
nice
complexity
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
pours
a
darker
copper
color
pushing
brown
but
just
barley
maintaining
its
red
tint
its
got
a
luscious
off
white
head
several
inches
tall
and
holding
on
pretty
well
the
nose
is
the
english
malt
and
caramel
sweetness
i
expected
not
really
convincing
me
this
is
anything
special
some
dryness
rather
than
sweetness
though
and
my
palate
always
leans
that
way
so
i
take
a
sip
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
how
mellow
the
sweetness
factor
is
i
am
allowed
to
taste
the
rich
english
malt
but
i
dont
have
to
deal
with
its
usual
residual
sugars
there
is
also
a
mild
bittering
hop
finish
that
gives
some
nice
balance
im
not
sure
what
the
yeast
is
but
it
almost
comes
across
like
a
lager
finishing
crisp
and
super
clean
for
a
beer
of
this
malt
persuasion
good
carbonation
soft
like
a
cask
and
not
filling
at
all
i
could
session
this
big
time
overall
an
impressive
regular
beer
from
goose
island
usually
their
sixpack
stuff
comes
up
short
for
me
but
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
cold
weather
brew
and
one
i
will
stock
the
fridge
with
come
fall
body
is
not
thin
at
all
just
real
approachable
carbonation
is
good

a
dark

with
a
nice
fluffy
off

smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
slight
syrupy
notes
nice
combination
tastes
of

and

very
malty

quite
balanced
with
spiciness
and
slight
chocolate

coffee
notes
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
bite
beer
is
carbonated
correctly
and
although
it
is
of
medium
body
this
is
definitely
sessionable
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
great
beer
stylistically
in
check
and
for
my
taste
its
a
wintertime
session
beer
for
sure
i
would
buy
a
case
of
this
to
keep
on
hand
any
winter
im
giving
it
a
4
5
overall
only
because
i
havent
tried
any
other
breweries
examples
of
this
style
this
is
certainly
better
in
mar
then
oct
a
little
time
to
let
winter
settle
in
i
guess
pours
a
solid

crisp

hint
of

apples
on
the
nose
green
apples
black
tea
and
a
smooth
finish
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
prost
o
overall
moderate
mild
complexity
mildly
amusing
and
mild
drinkability
decent
alcohol
warmth
but
nothing
that
holds
and
keeps
your
interest
whiff
off
toffee
and
toasted
barley
copper
with
a
decent
head
the
taste
reminds
me
of
the
buckwheat
tea
mugicha
that
i
used
to
drink
in
japan
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
balanced
out
by
toffee
giving
it
a
slightly
sweet
finish
medium
light
bodied
this
was
my
standard
beer
this
winter
when
watching
football
games
at
the
local
bar
good
winter
time
beer
of
which
you
can
have
more
than
one
othis
is
a
fairly
middleoftheroad
effort
perhaps
my
bottle
was
a
touch
over
the
hill
but
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
intensity
from
the
malts
and
some
more
spices
from
a
beer
touted
as
a
winter
seasonal
on
the
positive
side
this
might
be
a
good
brew
if
you
have
palate
fatigue
or
are
trying
to
introduce
somebody
to
craft
damn
this
is
tasty
tasty
beer
abv
seems
a
bit
high
for
the
style
but
wow
this
goes
down
easy
and
then
some
another
fantastic
beer
from
goose
island
12
ounce

noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
dark
mild
ale
good
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
definitely
an
interesting
beer
but
the
breadiness
up
front
dampened
my
enthusiasm
a
fair
amount
i
had
a
very
bad
experience
with
fat
tire
many
years
ago
in
seattle
its
scarred
me
for
life
close
but
no
trip
up
the
red
carpet
this
ones
good
conclusion
i
have
only
had
two
american
bottled
versions
of
this
style
most
of
the
examples
of
this
style
have
been
on
cask
in
england
and
this
one
is
the
winner
hands
down
not
up
to
par
the
real
stuff
on
cask
but
a
great
bottled
offering
now
if
they
could
make
it
bottle
conditioned
and
tone
down
the
carbonation
this
would
be
even
better
overall
i
am
presently
surprised
by
this
beer
ive
been
passing
this
up
quite
often
and
find
myself
regretting
it
now
a
pretty
darn
tasty
malty
beer
thats
easy
drinking
and
affordable
go
out
and
try
it
definitely
a
strong
seasonal
to
revisit
looked
great
poured
a
brilliant
mahogany
brown
and
produced
a
creamy
1
5
inch
tan
head
that
slowly
subsided
some
decent
malt
in
the
nose
and
suggestions
of
hops
faint
hints
of
cocoa
and
spice
mediumlight
body
surprisingly
short
some
lingering
bitter
notes
not
much
malt
on
the
palate
light
fresh
and
mild
not
as
dark
as
expected
some
lace
develops
when
looking
for
a
mild
ale
i
will
look
elsewhere
next
time
o
great
i
really
liked
this
one
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
when
the
weather
is
cold
this
is
a
rather
simplistic
beer
it
has
decent
flavor
with
a
very
malty
presence
this
is
a
beer
brewed
to
style
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
and
lower
sessionable
abv
this
beer
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
one
interested
throughout
a
session
but
there
isnt
much
here
to
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
crowd
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
once
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
12
oz

lasting

and

toasted

spicy

spicy

herbal
grassy
hops
and
hints
of
coffee
finish
is
long
and
dry
tangy
spicy
not
bad
brew
i
really
like
rye
beers
and
this
one
is
great
for
the
very
reason
i
enjoy
them
you
can
taste
the
rye
malt
in
this
it
has
a
mild
toasted
flavor
with
subtle
sweet
and
mild
nutty
earthiness
there
is
a
light
herbal
hoppiness
which
is
just
enough
to
keep
it
all
balanced
a
very
flavoral
yet
not
overdone
beer
i
really
cant
imagine
many
ways
to
improve
upon
this
except
maybe
more
of
the
same
i
really
thought
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
and
would
certainly
order
this
any
time
it
is
available
overall
not
a
bad
take
on
a
mild
english
winter
warmer
but
not
something
i
would
run
out
and
get
again
try
it
if
you
love
esbs
clear
dark
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
with
fair
retention
and
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
caramel
bread
and
toasted
malt
has
some
spice
and
light
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
not
much
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
overall
ok
but
not
great
malts
are
quite
nice
but
the
hops
are
not
as
much
so
too
much
overall
on
hops
especially
the
herbal
flavors
for
a
mild
even
an
english
mild
but
still
fairly
tasty
and
drinkable
brown
on
color
with
reddish
hues
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
dense
off
white
foam
that
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
earthy
grainy
aromas
with
dark
malt
toasted
malt
and
dark
ripe
fruit
medium
and
bodied
and
buttery
smooth
below
the
assertive
tangy

up

tangy
through
the
middle
followed
by
floral
hop
flavors
earthy
toasted
grain
and
bready
flavors
at
the
end
with
a
dark
roasted
malt
and
lightly
bitter
finish
finished
crisp
and
semidry
odnot
as
drinkable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
it
was
far
more
flavorful
than
i
expected
as
well
well
worth
a
try
id
actually
try
it
again
in
a
different
setting
with
a
bit
more
time
to
dissect
this
beer
i
guess
chicago
hopes
for
a
mild
winter
but
in
muncie
i
love
a
snowy
winter
so
mild
seems
less
then
optimal
for
me
of
course
it
now
says
brewed
in
baldwinsville
ny
pours
a
really
thick
head
that
takes
a
long
time
to
dissipate
a
very
rich
dark
caramel
color
is
what
you
see
looks
great
in
my
beatles
rubber
soul
glass
too
actually
probably
darker
then
caramel
but
not
a
chocolate
color
smells
great
malty
and
something
like
nutmeg
or
at
least
nutty
in
a
good
way
malty
taste
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
caramel
etc
i
cant
really
discern
a
whole
lot
but
it
taste
good
very
hearty
feel
and
enjoyable
o
a
nice
easy
winter
drinker
void
of
any
spice
rack
or
dark
roasted
malts
certainly
mild
in
both
smell
and
taste
but
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
a
little
higher
in
abv
than
the
style
calls
for
but
it
is
brewed
in
america
after
all
o
this
is
the
first
english
dark
mild
ale
ive
had
so
i
had
no
expectations
going
in
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
its
easy
to
drink
and
understated
but
definitely
drinkable
it
isnt
too
bad
if
there
is
nothing
else
on
tap
o
nothing
remarkable
but
a
good
option
if
youre
looking
for
something
mild
c
o
a
supremely
easy
drinking
brew
with
good
flavors
not
one
ill
run
back
to
get
but
if
there
were
a
bunch
a
a
party
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
pours
a
brown
ale
with
some
red
accents
occassional
foam
as
i
agitate
is
light
tan
nose
is
spicy
and
malty
there
are
hints
of
cinnamon
and
some
earthy
hops
but
mostly
a
simple
bready
nose
taste
carries
a
nice
brown
ale
character
accented
with
a
rye
ambience
nicely
spicy
with
a
tone
of
brown
ale
not
mild
ale
medium
bodied
with
a
lighter
carb
and
a
nice
forgettable
finish
this
beer
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
which
is
exactly
as
it
should
be
well
executed
this
brew
was
a
waste
of
time
and
a
waste
of
1
70
good
thing
i
only
bought
a
single
not
recommended
o
a
straightforward
winter
beer
from
gi
that
you
can
drink
multiple
of
in
an
evening
overall
this
was
quite
a
dissapointment
for
me
i
love
solid
brown
ales
winter
ales
rye
ales
as
long
as
they
have
a
quality
flavor
profile
this
one
however
does
not
and
really
misses
the
mark
because
of
the
hollow
malt
backbone
and
weak
mouthfeel
the
finish
just
lingers
in
an
unpleasant
way
for
me
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
midst
of
everything
and
even
though
this
wasnt
a
session
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
nothing
stood
out
with
this
but
nothing
was
offensive
either
and
once
in
a
while
its
good
to
have
a
beer
like
this
for
the
transition
from
fall
to
winter
it
tasted
just
slightly
burnt
without
leaving
any
type
of
burning
sensation
putting
the
mild
into
this
mild
ale
o
you
can
pass
on
this
one
i
tend
to
like
beers
like
this
good
flavor
but
not
too
heavy
or
to
high
of
an
abv
o
overall
a
pretty
good
dark
mild
ale
as
expected
super
malty
and
a
little
spice
in
the
taste
would
have
it
again
especially
at
a
bar
with
not
a
ton
of
craft
options
o
overall
this
brew
delivers
on
the
description
it
is
a
nice
winter
brew
and
truly
mild
i
just
wish
it
was
more
robust
as
it
just
falls
a
little
flat
for
me
overall
a
sessionable
winter
offering
that
provides
a
good
amount
of
flavor
at
a
reasonable
abv
somewhere
between
a
brown
ale
and
winter
warmer
overall
this
is
too
bitter
and
way
too
strong
to
be
anything
but
an
english
inspired
mild
among
my
least
favorite
alleged
milds
from
the
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
ogood
easy
to
drink
beer
while
not
spectacular
very
solid
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
grey
head
moderate
retention
on
a
rubymahogany
body
aroma
includes
caramel
malt
with
some
light
roast
some
raisins
a
hint
of
coffee
and
some
candi
sugar
taste
includes
light
coffee
some
fig
and
some
candy
sugar
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
no
objectionable
flavors
and
should
be
appealing
to
most
people
overall
a
decent
beer
here
nothing
incredibly
special
but
it
does
the
trick
mild
malt
sweetness
and
a
tad
too
much
bitterness
throughout
good
though
slightly
underwhelming
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
the
mouthfeel
is
too
carbonated
for
an
english
beer
style
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
beer
it
makes
this
beer
even
more
of
a
versatile
pair
with
burgers
or
a
rich
risotto
overall
i
like
this
beer
id
be
happy
to
down
a
pint
or
three
at
my
neighborhood
bar
a
good
winter
drinker
good
english
ale
with
a
cold
weather
twist
an
ambitious
seasonal
worth
trying
o
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
familiar
its
comforting
and
it
i
mean
can
i
say
this
it
makes
me
happy
its
like
an
old
friend
so
for
me
its
a
great
beer
even
if
its
not
necessarily
anything
special
i
like
it
this
is
not
a
mild
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
have
no
idea
who
would
label
it
as
such
the
carbonation
is
far
too
high
and
the
flavor
is
more
of
a
wellhopped
brown
ale
with
rye
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
actually
im
disappointed
i
only
picked
up
one
in
a
mixed
sixpack
it
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
for
a
cold
minnesota
fall
night
like
this
this
is
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
several
pours
would
be
a
tasty
treat
on
a
winter
afternoon
or
evening
overall
a
fairly
decent
winter
ale
as
its
not
too
heavy
and
yet
maintains
a
nice
flavor
profile
a
great
tasteing
beer
smells
boozy
but
its
not
its
a
great
tasteing
beer
for
english
dark
mild
ale
if
you
like
these
beers
s
then
you
will
like
this
low
in
acl
so
enjoy
drinking
it
great
taste
low
hop
so
enjoy
this
beer
great
color
may
be
not
great
taste
at
frist
sip
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
it
taste
great
and
go
down
fine
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
retention
leaves
a
bit
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
and
the
lacing
is
scattered
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
earthy
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
toasted
with
a
very
light
chocolate
flavor
and
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
its
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
its
a
malty
brew
its
gives
off
some
nice
english
elements
its
a
good
brew
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
by
the
title
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
winter
warmer
but
turned
out
being
a
dark
ale
that
i
actually
enjoyed
which
is
rare
for
me
to
say
lol
o
an
easy
going
winter
ale
thats
great
for
a
cool
night
by
the
fire
a
dark
golden
brown
color
with
a
substantial
oatmeal
colored
head
and
strong
lacing
very
nice
the
aroma
brings
chocolatey
cardboard
and
mild
nutty
citrus
sort
of
swampy
in
a
decent
way
the
taste
brings
out
more
swampy
malt
and
herbal
hops
theres
a
vague
touch
of
chocolate
and
even
some
citrusy
highlights
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
even
carbonation
light
caramelcoffee
qualities
with
a
midland
feel
of
tingly
refreshment
that
makes
a
somewhat
dry
finish
decent
sessionable
nothing
memorable
but
worth
a
try
do
definitely
not
a
winter
warmerthis
lateseason
ale
follows
the
road
lesstraveled
down
the
path
of
obscure
english
ales
it
seems
to
be
as
much
an
english
brown
ale
as
it
is
a
mild
but
either
way
it
is
a
mannered
success
the
flavor
profile
is
well
established
but
its
the
small
details
that
seem
to
shine
brightest
it
promises
to
serve
well
as
a
cooking
ingredient
but
it
really
deserves
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
glass
m
smooth
texture
results
from
that
dash
of
rye
malt
on
a
medium
body
with
ok
carbonation
this
beer
doesnt
fit
the
abv
for
a
dark
mild
but
the
character
seems
to
it
a
sense
it
was
sort
of
a
like
a
roasty
brown
there
was
a
mix
of
bitter
grain
with
subtle
herbal
citrus
hops
the
malts
were
creamy
up
front
and
then
quickly
lighten
and
dry
out
there
are
hint
of
cola
and
cocoa
with
the
darker
bread
and
toffee
overall
a
very
cool
beer
i
might
have
to
go
back
for
more
o
interesting
flavors
and
quite
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
session
beer
that
i
would
have
no
trouble
enjoying
again
and
again
it
is
rather
unfortunate
that
this
is
not
such
an
easy
style
to
get
since
i
find
these
beers
to
be
right
up
my
alley
o
this
beer
is
quite
flavorful
and
is
also
very
sessionable
this
beer
goes
down
quickly
its
a
treat
and
makes
me
think
ill
be
buying
more
very
soon
one
of
my
favorite
goose
island
beers
o
overall
a
true
great
example
of
winter
brews
hope
to
get
more
of
this
one
before
to
long
rather
nice
a
satisfying
winter
beer
many
winter
brews
ive
tried
have
been
notably
lacklustre
so
this
is
a
pleasant
change
subtle
wellbalanced
flavours
and
a
fantastic
body
for
the
style
the
abv
is
a
tad
high
for
an
english
mild
but
this
is
very
drinkable
recommended
so
what
complements
this
bitter
ideal
i
would
ask
you
one
little
thing
what
goes
with
a
bitterish
beer
for
these
little
bitter
beer
lovers
i
might
suggest
go
with
some
dark
folk
music
like
townes
van
zandt
or
greg
browns
songs
of
innocence
and
of
experience
or
covenant
if
youre
more
into
jazz
then
go
with
ran
blake
all
the
way
o
a
tasty
winter
beer
and
one
that
could
make
it
into
my
regular
winter
rotation
o
very
likable
easy
drinking
session
ale
from
goose
island
very
much
a
winter
beer
from
look
to
taste
the
rye
adds
a
uniqueness
and
some
depth
i
know
they
are
calling
it
a
mild
of
sorts
but
this
one
would
do
better
with
a
bit
more
strength
which
would
amp
up
the
maltiness
and
fruitiness
we
all
know
milds
can
be
bigger
overall
pretty
impressive
for
a
mild
beer
the
rye
adds
some
great
flavor
good
balance
of
bready
sweetness
spice
and
bitterness
overall
not
a
bad
rye
beer
this
one
actually
has
a
rye
note
to
it
and
transitions
nicely
between
the
malt
and
sweet
finish
overall
smooth
and
rich
but
not
overly
filling
strong
malt
flavor
and
mildly
bitter
profile
a
little
bit
boring
after
the
first
few
sips
that
being
said
i
am
cracking
open
my
second
so
it
must
not
have
been
too
boring
a
very
enjoyable
beer
lots
of
complexity
especially
for
such
a
low
avb
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
done
the
taste
more
justice
in
my
explanation
but
this
one
is
really
hard
to
nail
down
onot
unenjoyable
but
not
enjoyable
either
not
one
ill
order
again
im
not
too
familiar
with
rye
beers
but
if
this
is
a
typical
example
id
be
happy
to
try
more
it
pouts
a
beautiful
coppery
color
with
a
nice
twofinger
head
the
rye
is
noticeable
especially
in
the
finish
which
seems
to
linger
for
an
impossibly
long
time
this
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
and
ill
add
it
to
my
good
lateseason
football
brews
list
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
large
head
of
slightly
tan
head
that
retained
well
and
left
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
rye
bread
sweet
bread
and
a
caramel
malt
the
flavors
were
pleasant
and
balanced
i
tasted
the
rye
distinctly
but
also
notes
of
toasted
malt
caramel
malt
and
a
slightly
spicy
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
was
quite
nice
a
satisfying
brew
the
rye
is
light
and
this
one
is
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
most
in
the
style
definitely
more
malty
that
most
rye
beers
a
very
good
and
drinkable
beer
tasty
but
seems
to
lack
a
slight
bit
for
me
overall
this
is
a
good
mild
ale
and
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
again
o
a
good
beer
with
the
right
amount
rye
to
make
it
worth
a
try
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
1123112022
sampled
on
january
2
2012
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
decent
enough
head
that
settles
after
a
few
minutes
but
never
quite
goes
away
not
a
lot
in
the
aroma
other
than
barkey
and
grains
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
with
some
relatively
nice
body
the
taste
is
very
much
like
the
aroma
with
a
whole
lot
of
grains
upfront
and
a
clean
crisp
hopped
ending
poured
in
a
pint
glass
poured
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
light
beige
one
finger
head
almost
white
in
color
slight
reddish
copper
color
when
held
up
to
light
nice
mild
smell
plum
and
light
nuttines
winter
smell
a
lot
of
retention
as
glass
empties
very
little
carbonation
slight
plum
and
nutty
flavor
great
balance
of
spices
and
flavor
a
perfect
winter
session
beer
one
of
my
favorites
that
i
always
have
on
hand
during
the
winter
this
was
simple
but
good
its
a
straightforward
ale
clean
smooth
and
some
nuance
would
have
again
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
well
balanced
brings
out
a
little
spicy
heat
as
it
warms
presumably
the
rye
as
noted
on
the
bottle
o
nice
seasonal
offering
has
a
subtle
warming
effect
good
for
a
few
o
this
is
a
good
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
other
beers
from
this
brewery
o
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
nice
detour
from
the
winter
warmer
style
that
most
of
the
holiday
seasonals
fall
into
i
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
of
these
guys
in
a
session
o
its
a
nice
winterholiday
seasonal
hearty
and
significant
enough
without
overwhelming
ones
palate
with
spice
or
bourbon
barrels
or
huge
abv
it
drank
quite
nicely
on
a
mild
winter
evening
of
my
own
highs
in
the
50s
during
the
second
week
of
december
i
guess
its
not
technically
winter
yet
overall
this
is
just
another
average
holiday
beer
for
me
nothing
really
stands
out
its
not
bad
just
not
memorable
overall
this
is
a
good
holiday
beer
suitable
in
cold
climates
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
satisfy
a
thirst
i
could
not
imagine
reaching
for
this
on
a
hot
day
which
is
clearly
why
it
is
seasonal
fairly
filing
a
great
contender
to
other
winter
season
brews
pours
a
deep
amber
with
an
off
white
1
finger
head
the
smell
is
good
it
has
a
light
roasted
smell
the
taste
is
also
good
the
roasted
malts
come
through
quite
well
i
would
like
to
have
some
more
spices
in
it
though
overall
a
good
beer
when
goose
said
mild
they
ment
it
with
this
one
the
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
but
just
enough
to
give
it
some
uniqueness
good
overall
brew
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
there
is
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
on
top
of
it
the
head
has
some
good
retention
and
it
leaves
some
nice
scattered
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
starts
of
with
some
nice
toasted
malt
aromas
there
is
some
spicy
rye
caramel
chocolate
coffee
mild
hops
nuts
and
some
chocolate
and
coffee
the
nose
is
quite
pleasant
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
the
toasted
malt
flavors
come
out
first
there
is
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
nice
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
rye
makes
itself
known
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness
the
flavors
are
their
but
they
seem
a
little
muted
at
times
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
toasted
malt
caramel
and
chocolate
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
real
smooth
feel
to
it
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
but
there
is
some
roasted
bitterness
and
some
mild
hops
that
balance
it
out
there
is
some
spiciness
from
the
rye
here
as
well
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
a
nice
easy
going
beer
that
has
good
flavor
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
in
an
evening
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
an
interesting
rye
beer
i
definitely
think
this
beer
is
worth
trying
and
i
would
buy
it
again
cheers
o
nice
winter
beer
as
the
name
says
its
great
for
a
mild
winter
night
oa
little
too
heavy
on
the
rye
and
not
enough
spices
and
nuttiness
that
i
like
from
my
winter
beers
overall
it
is
just
ok
flavor
is
interesting
but
not
enough
body
to
back
it
up

overall
a
very
nice
winter
ale
that
was
a
pleasant
surprise
at
the
small
town
local
liquor
store
havent
always
been
a
huge
fan
of
goose
island
but
they
seem
to
have
gotten
something
right
with
this
one
dont
remember
trying
a
beer
with
rye
before
but
it
is
definately
something
ill
look
forward
to
trying
again
overall
a
decent
winter
beer
easily
drinkable
and
decent
taste
o
a
solid
winter
beer
its
cool
to
see
one
thats
done
without
the
usual
load
of
spices
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
not
necessarily
your
traditional
spiced
winter
beer
but
it
is
definitely
unique
and
is
a
good
beer
for
the
season
great
value
for
a
great
brewers
beer
creation
must
try
o
nice
easy
drinky
great
feautre
of
malts
rye
is
integrated
nicely
notes
medium
in
body
and
quite
flavorful
on
the
palate
its
a
tasty
brew
and
the
rye
stands
out
nicely
wellbalanced
and
quite
sessionable
a
very
solid
winter
release
o
pretty
enjoyable
and
seems
to
represent
the
style
well
will
certainly
be
buying
this
again
the
beer
pours
out
clear
and
deep
brown
walnut
with
a
nice
rich
head
the
aroma
is
very
light
but
is
yeasty
and
reminds
us
of
rising
bread
and
nuts
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
and
true
to
the
style
nicely
spiced
rye
its
an
extremely
enjoyable
and
slightly
spiced
beer
that
isnt
overpowering
but
is
just
complex
enough
because
its
not
overpowering
like
some
winter
seasonals
this
really
is
a
great
session
beer
oits
really
an
interesting
brew
great
for
the
winter
hence
the
name
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
revealed
a
nice
copper
hued
amber
color
with
a
head
that
was
maybe
an
inch
or
so
high
and
balanced
out
well
along
the
walls
of
the
glass
aroma
was
heavy
hops
at
first
citrus
and
pine
but
as
it
warmed
some
balance
is
brought
forward
by
bready
malts
and
hints
of
caramel
nice
and
smooth
clean
finish
had
a
nice
bite
to
it
but
mellowed
tremendously
as
it
went
down
leaving
a
semi
dry
semi
sweet
finish
in
its
wake
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
sticky
and
coating
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
this
rye
beer
is
just
okay
there
is
nothing
in
the
beer
that
stands
out
as
anything
different
another
let
down
from
goose
island
imo
malt
flavors
are
present
but
not
robust
as
they
should
be
their
is
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
but
needs
more
leaves
an
aftertaste
of
metal
almost
the
only
good
thing
about
the
beer
was
it
was
smooth
wet
and
light
kinda
like
how
i
like
my
women
pours
a
clear
lightly
red
tinted
brown
color
moderate
cap
of
khaki
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
smell
begins
nutty
but
with
a
distinctive
earthyness
and
spiceyness
taste
is
nutty
touches
of
roast
chocolate
dark
bread
nice
spiceyness
throughout
with
an
earthyness
to
it
faint
kisses
of
carmel
and
earthy
hops
medium
bodied
very
smooth
a
nice
find
expected
a
mild
and
got
something
more
akin
to
a
nut
brown
ale
or
esb
the
rye
which
i
wasnt
even
aware
was
a
main
component
in
the
beer
gives
it
a
lot
of
charachter
o
quite
a
pleasant
beer
uncomplicated
easy
drinking
got
the
last
two
bottles
from
the
shelf
for
this
year
but
will
be
glad
to
see
it
return
a
couple
of
seasons
from
now
goose
island
mild
winter
was
one
of
the
beers
i
was
recommended
by
kegworks
facebook
blog
to
start
off
it
looks
and
smells
wonderful
it
is
also
to
date
is
the
first
rye
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
the
flavor
is
excellent
and
remains
solid
during
the
first
pull
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
but
what
is
really
impressive
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
goose
island
mild
winter
is
like
drinking
liquid
silk
i
could
draw
some
parallels
to
a
mouthfeel
equivalence
with
some
of
the
cold
coffee
beverages
on
the
market
such
as
the
starbucks
frappuccino
but
the
feel
of
this
beverage
in
your
mouth
is
truly
sublime
the
only
criticism
i
would
wage
against
this
beer
is
that
and
this
may
be
personal
is
that
it
makes
me
feel
thirsty
afterward
as
if
there
was
a
small
amount
of
msg
in
the
bottle
this
though
may
be
just
an
aspect
of
the
style
finish
little
hop
note
sneaks
in
after
the
other
notes
dissolve
on
the
end
o
im
a
fan
of
goose
island
but
this
one
is
a
bit
unremarkable
nothing
bad
just
not
one
that
im
going
to
buy
in
the
future
this
brewery
is
consistent
irked
that
they
arent
brewing
the
hexnut
brown
any
longer
more
irked
that
they
have
sold
their
soul
to
the
devil
drinking
as
much
as
i
can
now
in
case
big
brother
starts
messing
with
the
recipes
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
clear
ruby
with
an
inch
of
pillowy
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
it
smells
of
toasted
grains
and
fresh
rye
bread
malty
up
front
with
a
crisp
rye
finish
delicious
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
and
very
carbonated
overall
a
great
winter
session
beer
another
winner
from
goose
island
the
look
is
like
a
nut
brown
ale
but
with
a
fantastic
pillowy
cloud
head
and
terrific
lacing
the
smell
was
somewhat
doughy
and
a
bit
toasted
the
taste
was
mild
toasted
rye
bread
with
an
illusion
of
sweetness
slight
hops
in
the
catagory
of
1213
bucks
for
a
twelve
pack
this
one
gets
an
a
one
of
the
best
beers
for
the
money
along
with
honkers
ale
d
sessionable
got
to
the
end
of
the
glass
before
i
was
even
done
writing
this
review
reviewed
ontap
from
the
dim
bar
light
i
see
that
it
pours
a
darkish
brown
an
offwhite
head
laces
around
the
glass
pretty
well
smell
is
good
rich
malts
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
also
gloriously
malty
the
rye
acts
as
a
rich
almost
syruplike
note
to
the
beer
very
mild
on
the
palette
as
well
drinks
easy
and
well
a
fine
beer
for
this
time
of
year
slick
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
overall
fairly
lackluster
for
me
overall
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
drinking
any
time
of
the
year
refreshing
and
tasty
this
one
poured
a
nice
gingerbread
hued
color
with
a
good
thick
head
of
off
white
foam
the
smell
of
this
one
is
roasted
gingerbread
with
definite
signs
of
other
roasted
malts
brown
suga
and
possibly
nutmeg
this
one
tastes
warm
and
inviting
giving
off
its
malty
notes
with
the
added
brown
sugar
flavor
coming
in
at
the
end
to
balance
the
roasted
taste
with
a
nice
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
is
slightly
watery
with
some
bubbles
at
the
same
time
i
think
this
goose
island
brew
is
pretty
drinkable
but
definitely
prefer
the
regular
christmas
ale
drinkability
i
love
rye
beers
and
i
found
goose
island
mild
winter
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
nicely
balanced
it
would
go
well
with
many
things
chips
pizza
steak
salad
etc
d
very
drinkable
perfect
for
those
end
of
winter
days
an
ok
rye
beerwinter
seasonal
at
best
really
nothing
special
definitely
could
use
more
complex
flavors
and
a
thicker
richer
body
very
solid
regular
beer
will
buy
again
this
beer
pours
a
murky
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
solid
eggshell
colored
foam
that
recedes
quickly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
caramel
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
a
faint
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
lot
of
complex
toffee
and
caramel
malt
flavors
and
just
a
little
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
soft
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
o
not
bad
not
great
goose
islands
mild
winter
is
just
kinda
there
its
beer
take
it
or
leave
it
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
blah
and
one
i
wouldnt
pass
up
if
offered
but
one
i
wont
be
asking
for
by
name
drinkability
in
some
terms
the
beer
can
be
seen
as
simple
but
in
others
it
could
be
seen
full
of
complexity
nice
and
quaint
but
full
of
flavor
drinkability
this
beer
is
alright
easiliy
drinkable
i
like
the
burnt
toast
flavor
ok
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
at
one
time
this
could
be
good
in
the
fall
as
well
as
the
winter
the
style
is
something
newer
to
me
so
once
i
have
a
few
more
ill
see
how
they
all
stack
up
the
head
on
this
beer
was
creamy
and
tan
and
lingered
for
quite
a
bit
i
thought
the
beer
showcased
the
rye
very
well
as
it
was
present
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
the
roasted
malts
were
also
very
smooth
and
mellow
which
allowed
the
rye
to
shine
through
other
spices
are
present
in
the
smell
and
taste
the
carbonation
is
low
and
it
allows
for
a
very
easy
drink
biggest
blizzard
to
hit
chicago
since
1967
better
get
inside
and
drink
some
goose
island
mild
winter
to
stay
warm
poured
it
from
the
bottle
into
a
big
willi
glass
as
suggested
the
beer
formed
a
beautiful
head
which
led
to
decent
lacing
the
clear
copperamber
color
was
a
sight
to
see
not
much
to
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
the
rye
used
the
taste
is
good
comes
off
the
pallate
dry
like
most
ryes
will
is
this
a
session
beer
you
bet
your
bottom
drink
up
my
friends
drinkability
one
of
the
best
goose
island
beers
i
have
had
i
can
really
taste
the
rye
yet
it
is
not
overwhelming
i
like
how
it
combines
with
the
pale
malts
i
could
easily
six
this
one
i
would
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
edit
2511
the
more
i
drink
this
one
the
more
i
am
impressed
and
the
more
complex
the
flavors
seem
to
get
the
rye
stands
out
more
and
more
as
you
experience
this
and
know
what
to
look
for
this
tastes
like
a
loaf
of
fresh
rye
bread
each
swirl
of
the
glass
reignites
the
foam
and
the
creamychewiness
is
amazing
i
like
this
more
each
time
i
try
it
and
had
to
give
it
props
this
beer
is
definitely
in
my
top
10
to
have
in
the
fridge
all
the
time
list
if
founders
reds
is
my
goto
ryeipa
this
is
my
goto
ryebrown
ale
these
two
will
keep
any
rye
lover
happy
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
rye
bread
taste
doesnt
do
it
for
me
goose
island
mild
winter
was
a
deep
amber
color
with
some
very
fine
particles
floating
about
it
had
a
beige
head
that
didnt
last
with
very
little
lacing
the
smell
was
malt
and
rye
bread
with
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
a
little
earthy
with
some
pepper
quite
interesting
it
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
was
an
interesting
ale
and
worth
a
try
on
tap
at
goose
island
as
well
as
from
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
drink
think
peppermint
clear
medium

carbonation

soft
great
drink
what
can
i
say
d
lower
of
the
alcohol
scale
and
mild
taste
good
combination
for
drinkability
d
this
beer
was
a
nice
crisp
tasting
beer
the
low
ibu
count
makes
it
a
easy
to
drink
beer
for
anyone
really
the
abv
lends
to
the
drinkability
as
well
mild
ale
not
really
which
bugged
me
rye
beer
more
so
than
mild
ale
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
a
lot
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
which
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
really
liked
that
it
was
a
winter
style
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavor
but
was
still
very
easy
to
drink
if
the
body
were
as
delightful
as
the
aromas
this
would
be
a
better
beer
although
there
isnt
too
much
to
complain
about
d
overall
this
beer
drinks
nicely
it
is
well
balanced
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
many
more
times
i
still
havent
had
anything
from
goose
island
that
i
havent
liked
taste
crunchy
grain
malts
probably
from
the
rye
along
with
toffee
and
a
butterlike
end
very
well
balanced
i
had
this
before
and
i
wasnt
fond
of
it
at
all
in
fact
i
remember
giving
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
away
this
is
a
nice
surprise
hits
the
front
of
the
mouth
with
a
sting
of
bitter
grape
then
creamy
malt
coats
the
mouth
with
a
chewy
full
flavor
finishes
with
yeastrye
bread
notes
very
nice
d
a
very
nice
rye
beer
with
good
spice
notes
and
wonderfully
drinkable
d

the
tangy
roast
tends
to
accumulate
over
time
not
because
theres
a
ton
of
it
in
the
beer
but
since
there
isnt
enough
of
a
counterpoint
a
good
beer
but
one
is
generally
enough
for
me
served
on
tap
into
16oz
pint
glass
reddish
beer
capped
by
half
finger
white
head
which
reduces
to
broken
lacing
almost
no
visible
carbontaion
faint
aroma
of
mild
toasty
malt
and
hints
of
spice
flavor
is
quite
enjoyable
lots
of
good
malty
flavors
biscuity
spicy
echos
of
cinnamon
toast
complete
with
raisins
for
a
beer
that
identifies
itself
as
a
winter
beer
this
one
is
quite
mild
with
high
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
under
carbonated
making
it
all
the
easier
to
swallow
but
perhaps
to
the
detriment
of
flavor
distribution
good
beer
got
this
brew
in
a
craft
your
own
sample
pack
from
my
locals
wegmans
best
idea
ever
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
now
before
i
review
any
further
this
was
my
first
time
trying
a
rye
beer
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
the
color
was
a
light
reddish
brown
with
a
fluffy
white
head
this
had
a
light
caramel
scent
with
strong
malty
flavors
the
taste
i
couldnt
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
fast
enough
it
wasnt
the
worst
taste
just
kinda
strange
it
didnt
make
sense
to
me
what
was
going
on
in
my
mouth
there
was
a
dry
malty
resin
left
in
my
mouth
it
took
more
than
a
couple
mouth
fulls
to
get
used
to
then
the
beer
began
to
flow
a
little
easier
not
sure
if
it
was
the
style
or
just
the
beer
but
definitely
not
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
nothing
stands
out
in
particular
the
taste
seems
just
a
bit
off
for
the
feel
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
here
great
rich
appearance
with
a
nice
foamy
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
not
complex
but
a
fine
malty
woody
thing
flavor
again
is
not
complex
but
ruled
by
the
rye
its
well
down
though
not
overpowering
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
a
unique
tasting
winter
its
good
i
rarely
feel
like
ive
been
let
down
when
i
drink
goose
island
d
overall
this
beer
drank
very
well
another
fine
beer
by
goose
island
i
thought
they
did
a
good
job
combining
the
classic
ingredients
of
malt
and
rye
into
a
easy
but
complex
tasting
drink
not
something
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
and
kind
of
heavy
on
the
stomach
but
good
to
have
one
every
once
in
a
while
d
as
i
said
a
good
one
to
put
on
some
music
and
chill
with
in
the
warmth
while
watching
the
rest
of
the
world
deal
with
the
bitter
cold
outside
your
window
drinkability
nothing
of
great
note
here
just
slightly
malty
good
tasting
quaffable
beer
i
wouldnt
hunt
for
this
one
but
a
person
could
do
a
lot
worse
d
this
is
a
nice
crisp
beer
that
is
malt
forward
with
some
good
depth
from
the
rye
and
nice
support
from
the
hops
d
very
easy
to
consume
would
prefer
a
little
more
complexity
to
draw
me
back
overall
a
very
solid
winter
seasonal
from
the
folks
at
goose
island
very
drinkable
great
beer
drinkability
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
a
well
balanced
mild
and
overall
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
winter
d
im
going
to
pass
on
this
one
d
drinkable
but
forgettable
lineup
filler
for
gi
at
best
overall
great
value
on
this
one
with
a
nice
nonoffensive
flavor
this
is
one
everyone
can
enjoy
d
perfect
beer
for
the
cold
weather
another
fine
brew
from
goose
island
d
a
nice
winter
warmer
type
beer
but
it
seems
that
they
could
increase
the
alcohol
on
this
one
to
be
more
of
the
style
but
perhaps
thats
why
its
called
mild
winter
while
it
does
have
a
hearty
graininess
goose
island
mild
winter
is
mediumbodied
casually
drinkable
and
has
a
tangy
refreshing
quality
that
actually
suits
not
those
cold
dark
snowy
nor
eastertype
storms
but
rather
as
its
name
proclaims
more
temperate
and
balmy
weather
whatever
the
forecast
i
see
a
high
probability
of
repeat
purchase
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
orange
on
the
edges
finger
thick
white
head
which
fades
quickly
into
moderate
lacing
not
much
aroma
at
all
taste
is
a
nice
nutty
sweet
mild
rye
aftertaste
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
not
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
exactly
what
you
hope
for
in
a
winter
beer
there
is
a
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
and
as
aforementioned
the
beer
would
serve
well
as
a
blizzard
session
beer
there
is
just
the
right
amount
of
a
somewhat
muted
carbonation
level
to
the
beer
which
really
allows
the
beer
to
have
to
be
forced
onto
and
across
the
palate
with
each
and
every
sip
d
good
appearance
on
goose
islands
part
but
the
flavour
and
smell
was
not
up
to
their
regular
standards
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
from
gi
d
good
drinkability
i
may
come
back
to
this
again
this
winter
and
would
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
for
a
lighter
winter
offering
totally
the
wrong
style
tag
but
totally
the
right
name
so
i
brought
this
beer
along
to
drink
after
a
hike
on
a
mild
lateautumn
day
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
have
enjoyed
other
goose
island
products
and
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
i
did
not
realize
it
was
a
rye
beer
an
i
had
never
had
a
rye
beer
before
this
was
certainly
the
most
refreshing
winter
beer
id
ever
had
and
it
was
spoton
for
after
a
strenuous
hike
i
would
describe
the
beer
as
light
i
did
get
the
vanilla
and
hazelnut
taste
it
also
was
creamy
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
in
the
afternoon
you
could
certainly
enjoy
a
couple
i
think
you
would
like
this
beer
and
i
would
suggest
picking
some
up
i
the
name
on
this
one
says
it
all
it
is
mild
and
mellow
easy
going
and
tranquil
serene
and
sedate
dark
amber
sweet
and
a
touch
fruity
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
it
is
what
it
claims
to
be
a
mild
winter
warmer
glad
i
bought
a
6
pack
ready
to
open
my
2nd
drinkability
i
like
this
better
than
any
of
the
other
gi
seasonals
and
right
now
i
would
say
that
it
holds
up
to
the
year
round
offerings
as
well
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
similar
to
a
cream
soda
carbonation
makes
the
beverage
seem
almost
fluffy
there
are
mild
winters
in
chicago
this
one
pours
a
clear
garnetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
black
pepper
rye
spice
very
light
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
wheat
and
nutmeg
the
taste
loads
up
on
the
rye
and
pepper
with
some
light
maple
syrup
very
light
molasses
and
cocoa
powder
backing
them
up
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
rye
beer
something
i
hope
to
have
more
of
in
the
coming
winter
months
this
one
pours
a
rich
hazelnut
in
color
with
a
light
white
head
it
smells
of
bread
bread
and
more
bread
i
know
its
a
rye
beer
but
it
smelled
like
nothing
but
oat
bread
unfortunately
it
also
tasted
like
nothing
but
oat
bread
i
like
oat
bread
but
not
as
a
beer
it
lacked
complexity
and
didnt
offer
anything
appealing
it
drank
fine
well
carbonated
and
smooth
but
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
again
its
too
bad
because
i
love
goose
island
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
essentially
an
english
nut
brown
with
the
addition
of
some
spicy
rye
in
the
grist
quite
effective
and
a
great
fireside
beer
when
a
more
modest
abv
is
preferred
good
stuff
d
while
i
think
this
is
an
extraordinarily
crafted
rye
beer
its
not
a
sessionable
one
the
flavor
does
become
a
little
bit
cloying
to
me
towards
the
end
of
the
pint
fantastic
brew
and
very
welldesigned
label
not
a
winter
staple
for
me
but
its
definitely
good
here
and
there
a
solid
winter
ale
the
rye
was
very
muted
mostly
acting
to
dry
the
beer
out
defintiely
better
as
it
warms
high
drinkability
for
me
this
is
a
good
beer
that
could
be
a
session
beer
overall
a
good
low
maintenance
drink
thats
pretty
unique
i
have
had
a
few
mild
ales
and
this
one
is
similar
with
its
malty
earthy
profile
the
rye
makes
a
step
above
most
in
this
category
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
heavily
hopped
winter
offerings
very
hoppy
with
a
mild
bitterness
enjoyable
worthy
of
your
time
and
a
good
session
goes
well
with
cigars
drinkability
really
good
stuff
straightforward
and
very
drinkable
i
wonder
how
many
calories
is
it
in
though
dm
drinks
very
smooth
goes
down
very
nice
and
doesnt
drink
heavy
and
also
doesnt
sit
heavy
very
enjoyable
overall
pretty
good
little
session
brew
a
few
things
i
might
change
if
i
could
but
its
hard
to
complain
about
them
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
im
not
sure
how
accurate
this
classification
is
as
goose
islands
website
refers
to
the
beer
as
an
american
mild
ale
that
is
not
a
category
available
here
on
ba
but
i
wonder
if
perhaps
there
is
a
better
class
for
this
listing
poured
a
chestnut
brown
moderate
roasted
malt
flavors
and
i
really
did
not
get
much
of
a
sense
of
the
rye
element
of
the
beer
a
pleasantenough
session
ale
but
im
a
bit
surprised
that
goose
island
would
pick
this
for
a
winter
offering
goose
island
seems
to
have
stepped
up
their
brewing
in
the
last
couple
of
years
and
this
is
another
triumph
this
rye
ale
is
an
attractive
deep
amber
with
a
rich
foam
and
a
fruity
biscuity
nose
so
far
seems
enticing
taste
is
a
surprisingly
smooth
and
spicy
with
a
hint
of
clove
subtle
and
tasty
this
ones
definitely
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
with
light
carbonation
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
hope
you
know
what
you
are
getting
when
you
buy
it
it
is
no
winter
warmer
essentially
a
dark
esb
drinkability
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
beer
that
could
easily
suffice
as
a
session
beer
poured
into
my
tulip
color
is
garnetcopper
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
pretty
decent
amount
of
time
the
nose
is
pretty
tame
with
just
a
bit
of
rye
and
light
caramel
the
taste
amps
it
up
with
caramel
rye
some
floral
hops
some
orange
and
a
little
spice
nice
feel
and
drinks
quite
well
in
the
end
althogh
it
is
somewhat
choppy
at
certain
points
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
head
not
a
strong
nose
smells
mainly
like
malty
goodness
very
drinkable
kinda
like
a
dark
esb
with
the
rye
lending
some
nice
heft
to
it
a
winter
session
beer
i
like
this
idea
a
lot
goose
island
has
really
been
brewing
strong
lately
received
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
poured
a
light
to
medium
brown
color
with
a
little
tan
head
aromas
of
cereal
light
hops
and
malt
onlightly
carbonated
medium
bodied
somewhat
creamy
on
the
palate
somewhat
sweet
lightly
hopped
with
hints
of
caramel
and
rye
a
solid
easy
to
drink
beer
d
goes
down
easy
bottle
dated
1014
very
fresh
sample
i
love
that
i
can
get
this
beer
fresh
and
know
it
is
so
from
the
bottle
pours
out
a
deep
copper
brown
with
a
very
white
head
reminds
me
of
an
english
red
ale
with
that
bright
white
head
smells
slightly
toasty
but
not
much
hop
presence
beer
looks
more
interesting
than
it
smells
that
is
one
area
that
i
find
the
bulk
of
goose
beers
kinda
fall
flat
aroma
and
mouthfeel
which
is
often
watery
but
more
on
that
later
the
taste
is
nice
a
roasted
flavor
hits
the
senses
first
followed
by
a
clean
bitter
finish
also
seems
somewhat
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
light
prickly
carbonation
on
the
tongue
this
beer
would
pair
well
with
a
lot
of
winter
foods
in
such
a
way
as
to
quench
the
thirst
after
eating
some
heavier
comfort
foods
this
mouthfeel
is
a
little
richer
than
the
average
goose
fair
and
could
be
benefitted
from
the
rye
some
vague
dark
breadiness
too
comes
forth
after
a
few
more
sips
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
this
as
a
good
fresh
fallback
beer
this
winter
albeit
not
extremely
complex
but
refreshing
nonetheless
i
had
to
wait
for
this
brew
to
warm
up
it
was
served
in
a
frozen
mug
not
by
request
it
was
very
tasty
and
left
me
wanting
more
d
actually
this
is
quite
drinkable
its
a
low
alcohol
lighter
bodied
winter
ale
that
is
nice
when
you
dont
feel
like
something
heavy
this
was
decent
but
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
the
hops
and
spice
toned
down
a
bit
in
the
taste
i
really
enjoyed
that
mix
of
breadiness
from
the
malts
and
rye
in
the
aroma
and
could
have
standed
to
have
some
more
of
that
coming
through
thanks
ghostee
for
the
opportunity
overall
a
good
beer
there
isnt
a
ton
going
on
but
it
is
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
d
this
beer
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
a
mild
mass
market
craft
beer
it
brewed
exactly
how
it
is
supposed
to
be
brewed
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
have
to
like
it
and
i
dont
personally
i
find
it
too
light
and
rather
one
dimensional
not
my
style
of
beer
and
not
one
i
will
be
searching
out
for
again
i
guess
i
have
always
preferred
a
mild
winter
after
all
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
the
top
appearing
a
little
darker
than
the
botton
and
a
nice
one
finger
pillow
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
little
breadiness
and
some
rye
along
with
a
faint
earthy
hop
smell
the
taste
is
a
roasted
malt
backbone
with
a
rye
hint
and
a
small
earhty
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
mildy
carbonated
overall
its
an
average
drinkable
beer
it
has
some
good
flavors
but
nothing
overly
complex
d
low
carbonation
and
creaminess
make
this
one
rather
easy
to
polish
off
notes
pretty
good
beer
that
is
very
bread
like
and
definitely
is
a
rye
beer
spices
worked
quite
well
and
really
compliment
the
wintery
feel
of
this
beer
md
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
rye
actually
chases
me
away
from
this
one
usually
i
down
rye
beers
like
water
but
this
one
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
d
for
me
this
was
a
great
beer
that
just
finishes
a
little
to
sweet
to
be
highly
drinkable
good
complexity
of
flavor
though
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
suppose
a
winter
beer
isnt
designed
to
allow
you
to
quaff
a
six
pack
i
am
enjoying
this
pint
while
watching
the
snow
pile
up
to
around
a
foot
and
a
half
which
seems
to
help
make
this
beer
better
d
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
session
this
for
sure
good
stuff
drinkability
the
medium
bodylow
carbonation
profile
of
this
beer
makes
it
excel
as
a
drinker
could
find
myself
drinking
a
number
of
these
on
tap
at
a
bar
goose
island
mild
winter
is
a
dense
looking
clear
reddish
light
brown
ale
with
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
foam
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
smells
quite
english
the
aroma
is
dank
and
doughy
and
funky
grassy
and
fruity
too
its
medium
light
bodied
and
quite
smooth
it
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
gritty
its
a
pretty
mature
flavor
its
really
well
balanced
and
quite
mellow
it
starts
almost
sweet
with
a
chocolaty
flavor
then
the
rye
is
detected
as
both
bread
and
whiskey
a
grassy
bitterness
zips
it
up
its
subtle
you
could
either
pound
this
or
brood
on
it
i
find
it
interesting
and
unique
there
arent
too
many
commercial
examples
of
this
style
anymore
so
i
had
to
try
it
when
i
saw
it
the
diacetyl
is
a
bit
distracting
for
me
but
besides
that
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
even
more
important
a
tasty
flavorful
but
not
overwhelming
beer
drinks
really
well
i
could
order
more
the
5
6
is
nice
not
to
heavy
not
to
lite
i
wouldnt
of
put
this
as
a
rye
if
i
didnt
learn
it
here
jonathan
passow
what
a
surprisingly
good
beer
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
left
a
good
112
of
puffy
head
which
extended
a
good
14
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
this
retained
all
the
way
down
left
good
lacing
dark
amber
color
not
much
smell
unfortunately
great
mildly
spicy
taste
though
nothing
overwhelming
just
a
very
tasteful
winter
beer
this
is
probably
the
best
winter
ale
ive
had
this
year
nice
balance
of
mild
malt
with
a
smooth
hoppy
finish
medium
body
and
great
drinkability
d
ill
have
this
one
again
for
sure
a
great

great

there
is

the

without
becoming
overpowering
very
subtle
complex
flavors
come
out
good
beer
with
a
foot
of
snow
outside
overall
a
good
session
winter
beer
the
rye
is
not
in
your
face
at
all
and
actually
has
a
nice
subtle
rye
bread
sort
of
quality
what
i
would
imagine
a
kvass
beer
might
be
like
d
nicely
drinkable
and
a
good
winter
ale
taste
kind
of
like
a
winter
warmer
with
the
rye
in
place
of
the
common
spices
used
in
winter
warmers
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
semisweet
caramel
malt
and
rye
scent
its
dry
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
mild
rye
spiciness
as
well
as
a
dry
roasted
character
its
easy
drinking
but
could
use
some
caramel
malts
for
some
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
rye
is
well
represented
its
a
bit
one
sided
but
not
bad
this
is
a
balanced
finetasting
and
drinkable
winter
offering
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
solid
malt
flavors
with
some
detectable
hops
its
an
easy
drinker
that
has
good
flavors
to
accompany
the
cold
season
without
leaving
you
bloated
d
for
a
rye
beer
its
pretty
good
nothing
really
special
but
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
thats
worth
trying
d
a
tasty
beer
and
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
though
not
as
sessionable
as
honkers
ale
pretty
tasty
and
definitely
enjoyable
a
good
example
of
using
rye
in
a
beer
but
not
exemplary
for
a
winter
beer
overall
i
love
this
brew
which
i
was
kind
of
surprised
i
have
tried
only
a
few
goose
island
products
and
i
wasnt
too
impressed
so
far
maybe
i
owe
it
to
this
brewery
to
go
back
and
try
some
of
the
ones
i
tried
again
this
makes
me
proud
to
be
a
citizen
of
chicago
i
am
just
bummed
this
was
the
only
one
left
it
is
head
and
shoulders
better
than
the
2
below
i
tried
yesterday
works
well
as
a
mild
winter
ale
i
really
like
this
although
theres
nothing
about
it
that
i
find
truly
exceptional
surprisingly
warming
for
5
6
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
ground
breaking
but
worth
a
try
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
prob
one
of
the
best
ryes
ive
had
yet
maybe
a
bit
light
for
a
winter
beer
but
i
could
def
make
this
one
of
my
top
10
session
beers
pours
a
darker
dull
brown
amber
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
sudsy
head
smells
like
an
esb
wet
grains
spicy
toasted
malts
caramel
light
floral
hop
bite
this
stuff
is
very
mellow
a
rye
esb
softly
spicy
softly
malty
softly
bitter
slightly
chewy
and
bready
light
floral
hops
mediumlight
bodied
with
sharp
carbonation
a
really
nice
balance
for
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
need
to
find
more
of
this
cant
seem
to
find
this
in
this
area
very
easy
overall
outstanding
beer
almost
wish
it
was
around
all
season
ive
always
thought
that
goose
island
brewed
some
mighty
fine
beers
and
after
matilda
this
would
be
my
second
favorite
cheers
a
rye
not
a
mild
recent
bottle
refreshin
with
that
rye
edge
moderately
pleasant
aroma
arising
from
a
medium
yellow
body
topped
by
good
amount
of
bubbled
head
lace
follows
through
very
drinkable
refreshing
warms
the
body
on
a
cold
night
average
mouthfeel
a
little
edgy
but
smooth
drying
aftertaste
unlike
many
ryes
it
doesnt
hit
you
in
the
palate
and
take
over
everything
it
is
a
bit
mild
as
in
the
name
for
a
rye
and
thats
why
i
like
it
its
still
good
even
though
they
are
almost
gone
conclusion
this
is
in
my
opinion
kind
of
the
american
equivalent
in
spirit
if
not
in
style
of
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
ale
its
a
quaffable
simple
unspiced
lightlyhopped
winter
warmer
style
beer
that
in
not
trying
to
overawe
or
overpower
ends
up
being
great
if
great
divide
can
make
a
rye
oktoberfest
whos
to
say
goose
island
cant
make
a
rye
winter
ale
i
would
say
its
pretty
drinkable
due
to
the
clean
finish
and
light
body
but
5
6
is
not
a
real
sessioner
still
not
a
bad
brew
to
have
a
few
of
nothing
here
to
really
scare
away
casual
drinkers
other
than
maybe
too
much
flavor
it
probably
would
be
an
easy
transition
for
those
who
liked
the
brown
ale
best
served
only
slightly
chilled
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
rye
gave
it
a
flavor
new
to
me
one
i
enjoyed
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
id
happily
have
more
of
this
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
wow
this
stuff
is
drinkable
i
could
put
back
many
bottles
of
this
one
this
is
a
good
light
feeling
beer
that
could
be
used
for
mass
consumption
tastes
not
quite
as
balanced
falls
too
far
towards
the
toffee
sweet
end
bready
candy
with
nothing
bitter
to
balance
it
candy
is
nicetheres
a
reason
kids
like
it
so
muchbut
i
usually
like
a
bit
more
in
my
beer
d
very
drinkable
abv
is
manageable
flavors
arent
overwhelming
although
somewhat
boring
its
winter
warming
affects
arent
as
strong
as
i
was
hoping
for
not
filling
drinkability
is
good
reminds
me
of
a
spicy
honkers
this
is
a
good
sessionable
fall
to
winter
style
beer
which
is
exactly
how
and
when
i
intended
it
d
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
one
off
and
on
throughout
the
winter
season
high
d
very
easy
drinking
and
super
sessionable
cant
beat
the
price
either
a
really
nice
winter
seasonal
from
goose
island
i
had
this
in
the
taster
flight
but
over
the
course
of
an
evening
i
could
have
had
it
all
night
long
much
easier
drinking
than
those
bcs
type
brews
matilda
included
poured
a
dark
brown
that
you
could
almost
see
through
with
a
respectable
head
that
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
pretty
quiet
but
i
got
a
bare
whiff
of
chocolate
when
i
first
poured
it
the
taste
was
mild
as
the
name
would
suggest
sweet
with
a
gentle
hop
presence
this
is
another
in
a
long
line
of
beers
that
really
improves
as
it
warms
the
caramel
then
came
out
strong
and
the
mouth
feel
also
thickened
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
both
flavor
and
abv
supported
sitting
down
with
a
sixer
one
of
the
cold
winter
nights
i
tend
to
enjoy
hopheavy
beer
so
this
is
certainly
not
a
brew
i
thought
id
enjoy
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
wouldnt
call
this
brew
delicious
but
its
quite
savory
and
pleasant
i
do
not
taste
the
variety
of
spices
that
others
here
mentioned
but
im
not
sure
any
spices
would
improve
this
ale
ill
be
having
a
few
more
of
these
and
looking
forward
to
it
each
time
winter
rolls
in
many
thanks
to
my

wow
dark

flavors
aggressive
carbonation
and
stinging

attack
the
tongue
very
drinkable
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
the
beer
is
decently
drinakable
nice
seasonal
nothing
special
that
i
would
go
out
and
search
for
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
an
interesting
take
on
the
typical
winter
seasonal
i
would
like
it
more
if
there
was
a
larger
hop
presence
drinkability
nice
for
cool
weather
moderate
abv
and
its
not
heavy
at
all
nice
mild
flavors
make
for
a
great
sessionable
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
during
the
holidays
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
really
wanted
something
sweeter
with
this
but
it
is
a
solid
rye
would
drink
a
ton
if
i
am
in
the
mood
but
would
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
to
seesion
these
drinkability
ridiculously
drinkable
for
a
winter
seasonal
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
milds
but
i
prefer
this
one
over
the
few
others
i
have
tried
d
goose
is
calling
this
an
american
mild
which
seems
contradictory
because
milds
were
always
light
in
hops
and
what
american
beer
is
light
in
hops
nonetheless

in

overall
interesting
lighter

with

a

the
addition
of
rye

was
a
good

very

i
might
want
something
a

plenty

a

is
a
passable

dark
ale
but
ill
add
an
asterisk
to
that
because
i
have
a
feeling
this
bottle
is
getting
a
little
old
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
both
craft
beer
fans
and
those
who
have
never
tried
anything
fancier
than
guinness
draught
should
be
able
to
enjoy
or
at
least
tolerate
i
will
need
to
try
this
on
tap
some
time
to
see
if
that
adjusts
my
perspective
at
all
but
for
now
id
say
this
one
is
worth
a
look
overall
dont
bother
with
this
until
its
almost
room
temperature
nice
but
i
have
had
other
english
ales
i
would
buy
first
overall
not
bad
i
received
it
for
free
and
have
seen
it
on
shelves
recently
and
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
some
time
after
tasting
it
now
i
would
recommend
trying
it
once
i
would
not
buy
this
though
after
this
review
something
about
that
flavor
on
the
end
of
the
taste
just
is
not
to
my
liking
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
malt
licky
sort
of
o
overall
i
was
floored
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
drain
pour
due
to
the
ravg
but
yeah
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
what
this
style
should
be

to

a

offering
o
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
example
of
what
an
english
mild
should
be
i
think
most
of
the
low
marks
come
from
people
expecting
an
american
amber
style
this
beer
nails
the
mild
style
if
anything
might
be
a
little
too
big
if
you
are
expecting
an
american
amber
or
an
esb
style
beer
then
you
will
be
highly
disappointed
this
historic
style
is
what
helped
keep
man
alive
when
you
couldnt
drink
the
water
it
brings
a
huge
smile
to
my
face
when
i
see
breweries
give
homage
to
such
styles
instead
of
trying
to
pack
another
100
ibus
into
the
next
hop
bomb
well
done
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beverage
is
its
ease
of
drinkability
in
line
with
its
stylistic
guidelines
it
is
certainly
not
the
most
exciting
beer
when
it
comes
to
flavor
or
aroma
as
it
has
that
dirty
dog
food
type
of
bite
regardless
there
is
enough
flavor
and
presentation
to
present
the
drinker
with
at
least
a
unique
style
of
beer
it
goes
down
without
complaint
and
is
nice
for
someone
looking
for
an
in
between
sipper
that
isnt
too
dark
but
isnt
too
light
as
always
were
excited
to
try
a
local
brewery
for
the
first
time
and
again
are
super
happy
that
this
is
a
bizarre
underrepresented
style
this
wont
become
a
fridge
favorite
for
us
but
we
will
certainly
look
for
other
beers
of
this
producer
to
see
what
theyve
got
to
round
out
their
arsenal
the
feel
is
also
flat
theres
a
barelymedium
body
but
both
smoothness
and
crispness
are
fairly
weak
its
not
that
there
isnt
crispness
but
its
barely
holding
on
the
whole
way
through
this
is
where
either
somethings
wrong
or
the
brewer
determined
that
lighter
body
meant
thin
and
watery
its
not
dead
but
its
dying
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
and
a
pretty
true
to
style
example
of
an
english
dark
mild
ale
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
this
style
but
this
beer
tastes
pretty
much
just
how
i
remember
a
good
english
dark
mild
ale
tasting
and
i
think
motor
city
brewing
did
a
good
job
at
representing
the
style
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
a
little
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
few
of
these
i
think
its
pretty
sessionable
and
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
good
beer
to
pair
a
meal
with
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
is
its
just
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
its
just
what
i
look
for
in
an
english
dark
mild
ale
and
i
dont
see
many
of
those
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
nothing
that
i
dislike
or
would
change
its
fine
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
ill
try
and
i
remember
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
next
time
i
go
on
a
beer
run
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
i
think
its
really
accessible
all
in
all
i
was
little
impressed
with
this
beer
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
their
lager
but
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
pretty
good
and
im
starting
to
think
that
the
english
ales
are
what
this
brewery
specializes
in
i
think
this
beer
is
on
the
same
level
as
their
nut
brown
ale
good
job
guys
i
enjoyed
this
one
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
to
me
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
a
light
beer
that
is
relatively
packed
with
taste
this
one
isnt
nearly
as
flavorful
as
the
style
allows
the
flavor
isnt
too
bad
just
way
to
weak
in
a
blind
tasting
of
4
dark
mild
ghettoblaster
new
castle
cabbie
shorts
earl
or
brixom
and
a
homebrew
it
placed
last
overall
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
great
example
of
this
style
but
its
ok
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
but
id
have
another
under
the
right
circumstances
ghettoblaster
turns
up
the
volume
on
a
style
that
is
typically
anything
but
loud
not
surprising
given
its
made
in
detroit
rock
city
while
i
suspect
some
of
this
added
personality
comes
accidentally
by
way
of
an
overactive
yeast
i
found
it
an
enjoyable
lowerstrength
offering
nonetheless
ill
look
to
try
more
from
motor
city
brewing
works
a
nice
product
from
motor
city
brewing
ghettoblaster
makes
for
a
very
nice
session
beer
when
you
plan
on
drinking
a
bit
this
is
soso
the
head
was
absolutely
ridiculous
at
first
i
ended
up
spooning
it
out
as
it
would
have
been
like
waiting
for
cupcake
frosting
to
dissipate
mild
tone
on
the
flavor
with
citrus
and
a
lot
of
malts
are
clearly
there
mild
certainly
also
a
mild
example
of
the
style
on
draft
at
the
michigan
brewers
guild
in
ypsi
this
pours
amber
into
my
little
plastic
cup
does
not
smell
like
much
maybe
a
slight
malt
in
the
nosethis
is
certainly
mild
where
is
the
flavor
i
know
this
is
a
mild
ale

this
beer
is
very
drinkable
burnheartsmke
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
barely
translucent
honeymahogany
malty
woody
slightly
sweet
aroma
is
not
strong
but
still
appealing
malty
flavor
has
honeysweet
and
woody
undertones
along
with
hints
of
hops
and
spice
fairly
smooth
tingly
texture
gives
it
a
decent
finish
d
not
the
best
representative
for
this
style
of
beer
as
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
going
for
it
in
all
categories
it
is
what
it
is
an
average
beer
d
a
session
brew
for
sure
kegs
of
ghettoblaster
seem
to
be
the
default
choice
for
gallery
openings
and
other
art
related
activities
in
and
around
detroit
drinkability
this
is
pretty
good
i
admit
that
i
tried
this
beer
just
because
i
thought
the
name
was
ridiculous
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
though
when
i
got
a
beer
that
is
good
and
is
something
i
could
drink
again
dgood
and
a
perfect
session
beer
i
used
to
drink
this
about
9
years
ago
and
was
looking
forward
to
finally
rating
it
but
this
bottle
my
bro
saved
me
is
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
ontap
version
i
had
the
other
day
or
as
in
my
memory
drinkable
brew
the
pour
was
very
nice
rich
looking
medium
brown
with
a
mild
cloudiness
about
it
rich
color
here
with
a
nice
head
of
off
white
which
hung
around
for
a
few
moments
before
settling
down
into
a
thin
film
the
aroma
was
light
medium
fruit
notes
apricot
maybe
with
a
hint
of
some
light
spice
and
tons
of
grain
more
of
the
same
on
the
taste
as
i
run
through
on
this
one
the
flavor
was
a
bit
lacking
for
me
nice
malt
profile
with
a
light
ouch
of
fruit
and
spice
but
not
nearly
strong
enough
of
a
profile
to
really
get
me
to
enjoy
it
smooth
mellow
carbonation
and
a
low
abv
made
it
nice
and
and
drinkable
though
a
bit
dull
overall
with
a
name
like
this
i
expect
alot
more
but
a
decent
beer
none
the
less
drinkability
very
high
if
i
liked
the
feel
more
id
probably
give
it
a
5
very
easy
to
drink
especially
with
food
a
quick
inspection
of
the
bottle
reveals
a
location
for
a
best
before
date
stamp
but
no
date
stamped
anywhere
the
beer
is
a
clear
copper
and
poured
with
a
thin
wisp
of
fine
offwhite
bubbles
that
formed
a
bit
of
a
collar
fairly
sticky
lacing
just
not
a
lot
of
it
the
meager
head
did
linger
though
the
aroma
was
mild
some
earthy
malt
hint
of
fruit
light
hopping
perhaps
some
chocolate
far
in
the
background
as
it
warmed
there
were
light
notes
of
toast
and
nuts
light
bitterness
malt
seemed
a
bit
thin
right
from
the
start
some
sweetness
caramel
mostly
and
mild
hop
flavour
but
still
quite
mild
overall
a
little
buttery
lingering
dark
malt
bite
without
the
fullness
of
flavour
expected
from
these
grains
carbonation
was
on
the
low
side
fine
for
the
style
but
the
body
felt
watery
rather
than
just
light
a
bit
dry
inoffensive
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
not
a
beer
that
id
look
for
again
id
still
try
it
if
found
on
tap
though
just
to
see
how
it
is
under
different
serving
conditions
d
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
i
had
it
while
helping
to
prep
the
thanksgiving
dinner
itd
be
great
for
a
backyard
bbq
tailgate
or
holiday
gathering
this
beer
is
also
overly
mild
even
for
mild
ale
at
best
i
find
it
to
be
kind
of
lame
dark
shoe
leather
copper
with
bronzed
edges
small
bubbly
ring
of
offbeige
head
light
plum
and
blackberry
fruit
notes
mix
with
roastedtoasted
malts
and
a
yeasty
twang
toasted
biscuit
and
cardboard
malt
notes
up
front
mild
winey
fruit
notes
midpalate
some
lightly
roasted
malt
comes
through
light
herbal
hop
and
grainy
bitterness
in
the
clean
dryish
finish
moderate
body
with
a
vastly
overcarbonated
feel
if
this
were
creamier
and
fuller
and
less
carbonated
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
still
this
has
promise
and
maybe
it
would
be
much
better
oncask
final
thoughts
with
a
name
like
ghettoblaster
i
expected
more
once
i
got
over
the
initial
disappointment
and
took
the
beer
for
what
it
was
it
was
a
decent
beer
pretty
good
but
not
as
aggressive
as
the
name
promised
dark
brown
with
slight
head
faint
aroma
very
watery
as
their
lineup
tended
to
be
this
night
understated
carbonation
drinkable
and
a
session
ale
taste
is
mostly
in
the
malt
profile
with
chocolate
malt
and
caramel
could
have
been
a
cask
ale
in
a
blind
tasting
nothing
exceptional
d
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
session
brew
from
the
bottle
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
color
of
this
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
golden
color
poured
a
light
mahogany
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
browm
sugar
malts
dark
fruits
sweet
flavorthe
flavors
did
not
come
close
to
the
aroma
everything
was
on
the
weak
side
got
malts
some
hops
sugar
to
bad
the
flavor
did
not
live
up
to
the
aroma
it
was
a
easy
drinking
beer
downable
a
good
session
brew
i
would
drink
it
again
especially
now
that
i
have
a
better
idea
of
what
a
mild
is
lightmedium
mouth
this
is
the
apotheosis
of
a
session
brew
this
beer
is
very
light
brown
in
color
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
fruity
malty
profile
this
mediumbodied
beer
starts
out
with
a
light
spicy
clean
hops
bitterness
then
continues
on
to
a
huskygrainy
malt
flavor
and
then
ends
with
a
slight
burnt
aftertaste
im
hoping
that
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
because
most
motor
city
beers
are
much
better
than
this
wow
thanks
to
proc
for
reccomending
this
brew
pours
out
to
a
brown
sugar
color
with
the
very
slightest
hint
of
cloudiness
medium
carbonation
and
a
head
that
stood
the
test
of
time
and
was
very
well
formed
odors
of
nuts
barley
and
honey
were
detected
but
the
sweetness
was
not
overpowering
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
overtones
of
malt
and
dough
finishes
well
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
aftertaste
my
buddy
proc
summed
it
up
well
this
is
a
session
beer
and
a
damned
fine
one
when
a
sixer
is
only
about
7
dollars
strongly
recommended
when
in
the
detroit
area
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
wellcarbonated
and
lively
very
sessionable
great
beer
just
dont
understand
the
name
or
the
style
though
i
would
almost
call
this
a
brown
ale
instead
of
the
english
mild
it
declares
itself
many
thanks
to
trbeer
for
sharing
thanks
to
trbeer
for
the
beer
my
brother
and
i
figured
that
the
great
lakes
invitational
championship
game
u
of
m
vs
msu
was
the
perfect
chance
to
crack
this
one
open
and
we
were
right
ironically
i
have
this
one
in
the
levitation
glass
and
though
its
not
quite
up
to
the
levitation
standards
its
definitely
a
very
solid
session
drinker
with
a
nice
malt
character
i
love
caramel
malt
and
just
the
right
touch
of
hops
and
this
is
one
id
be
glad
to
have
again
original
review
42602
a
mild
pale
ale
refreshing
you
could
put
down
quite
a
few
of
these
during
a
session
a
rather
light
pale
but
still
heavier
than
a
bass
ale
id
drink
this
again
a
great
beer
regardless
of
its
misnomer
this
beer
was
my
beer
of
choice
for
the
three
years
that
i
lived
in
the
cass
corrider
of
detroit
the
microbrew
only
being
two
blocks
away
made
it
easy
to
acquire
and
with
a
name
like
ghettoblaster
it
is
hard
to
pass
it
up
the
beer
pours
a
dark
with
little
head
the
smells
are
subtle
with
a
clean
taste
while
this
is
not
an
award
winning
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
does
not
take
long
to
polish
of
a
couple
of
pitchers
with
your
freinds
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
i
would
definately
have
another
in
fact
i
did
i
wasnt
expecting
much
of
this
beer
but
i
was
really
surprised
its
quite
a
tasty
brew
slightly
hoppy
and
toasty
aroma
and
tawny
brown
in
color
taste
has
a
toasty
malt
backbone
with
just
a
bit
flavor
hops
peeking
through
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
to
the
style
solid
beer
that
wont
overpower
or
bore
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
thin
head
and
a
vaguely
toasty
mostly
dusty
nose
the
flavor
is
all
malt
with
only
faint
hints
of
any
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
get
the
overwhelming
sense
of
raw
grain
very
simple
beer
awesome
name
better
effort
than
most
macros
overall
considering
the
abv
this
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
body
it
isnt
over
the
top
or
big
and
bold
but
it
is
fantastic
this
mild
greets
you
with
a
deep
rich
color
that
lets
you
know
exactly
what
you
are
getting
in
for
dry
flavor
with
hearty
caramel
and
toffee
overtones
the
perfect
complement
to
a
salty
or
smoky
dish
great
example
of
a
little
explored
style
replicates
a
true
british
session
ale
style
pure
malt
based
browncaramel
hued
ale
some
english
toffee
notes
with
minimally
noticed
aroma
mediumlight
mouthfeel
absolutely
a
beer
to
take
down
midweek
gotta
start
the
night
off
mildly
amiright
this
stuff
pours
a
slightly
murky
sienna
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
light
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuits
light
nuts
mild
grass
and
a
kiss
of
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
contingent
of
nuts
and
an
addition
of
dark
greens
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thickly
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
mild
id
probably
like
it
better
on
cask
or
something
but
here
its
still
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
nice
drink
that
went
well
with
the
food
refreshing
and
tasteful
acceptable
bold
for
style
the
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
brown
color
with
hints
of
auburn
when
held
to
the
light
the
nose
brings
caramel
malt
and
roast
bready
and
light
this
is
terrific
beer
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
what
a
session
beer
can
be
light
bodied
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
so
good
so
smooth
so
much
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
o
crisp
and
yet
watered
down
but
a
brew
that
you
just
wanted
to
drink
more
of
beer
is
thin
in
body
and
a
little
ashy
at
the
end
mildly
bitter
from
the
grains
overall
an
easy
drinking
decent
beer
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
mild
good
pours
a
dark
brownnearly
black
with
a
pretty
big
fluffy
tan
head
the
smell
is
nice
and
roasty
with
some
caramel
malts
also
factoring
in
the
flavor
really
nails
it
it
really
toes
the
line
between
roasty
and
flavorful
and
being
sessionable
and
refreshing
just
how
a
dark
mild
should
taste
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thinbodied
but
that
suits
the
style
just
fine
im
a
big
fan
of
dark
milds
and
this
really
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
pours
a
very
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
there
was
a
good
tan
head
and
some
nice
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brought
some
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
good
integration
that
gets
even
better
in
the
flavor
packed
with
beautiful
malt
notes
especially
considering
the
low
abv
lightmedium
body
with
a
slight
bit
of
chewiness
and
nice
carbonation
overall
a
really
excellent
beer
overall
not
particularly
impressive
although
nice
it
is
4
20
would
potentially
be
better
on
cask
so
light
and
refreshing
so
blackened
dark
and
evil
i
want
to
make
gravy
really
dam
good
and
fun
i
feel
like
i
could
just
pound
this
beer
all
day
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
realy
good
beer
lots
of
malts
and
super
easy
to
drink
would
love
it
if
they
canned
this
one
would
love
to
have
it
again
overall
love
low
abv
beers
that
are
packed
with
flavor
and
this
is
no
exception
very
easy
to
have
a
few
i
cant
recall
the
last
time
i
had
five
pints
of
the
same
beer
in
the
same
sitting
overall
a
very
good
take
on
the
english
dark
mild
pretty
full
flavored
and
hearty
for
a
lower
abv
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
exactly
a
session
ale
to
me
a
very
good
beer
overall
on
tap
at
the
bulldog
in
minneapolis
this
beer
arrives
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
and
burnt
malt
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
chocolate
burnt
malt
and
roasted
malt
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
mild
style
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
on
cask
as
i
think
its
true
colors
would
come
through
more
from
that
serving
type
overall
good
flavors
with
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
the
extra
hops
flavors
balance
the
big
malts
and
make
it
a
great
easydrinking
brew
one
of
my
favorite
nonsour
session
beers
smooth
subtle
flavorful
and
wellcrafted
not
bad
but
like
i
said
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
milds
were
meant
to
be
served
from
a
cask
and
this
beer
would
certainly
benefit
from
that
treatment
nonetheless
quite
drinkable
and
at
4
alcohol
this
is
a
pint
you
could
stick
with
all
night
overall
extremely
drinkable
and
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
brewers
should
make
more
beers
like
this
damn
you
omar
and
todd
can
this
now
the
palate
and
finish
of
this
ale
are
poor
extremely
thin
watery
and
flat
flavor
does
not
match
the
nose
which
isnt
too
bad
chocolate
coffee
roasts
and
wrecks
the
experience
not
a
great
product
from
a
respected
brewer
pales
in
comparison
quality
wise
to
the
rest
of
the
surly
offerings
i
realize
its
intended
as
a
different
beast
but
lets
be
blunt
and
honest
if
you
tasted
this
blind
you

i
dont
know
if
it
should
be
considered
a

i
could
see
myself
drinking

would
probably
be

at

i
thought
i
had
been

but
the
aromalook
soon
made
me
realize
i
was
given
the
correct
beer
not
sure
why
i
thought
this
was
going
to
have
a
lighter
look
to
it
the
aroma
is
more
pungent
than
i
would
have
expected
with

with

was

refreshing
and

as
a
homebrewer
i
find
this
beer
reminiscent
of
prefermented
wort
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
sessionable
beer
tons
of
flavor
with
out
the
huge
abv
or
caloric
intake
i
wish
there
were
more
of
this
style
around
drinkabilityextremely
drinkable
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
cask
plenty
of
subtle
character
to
this
sweeter
and
thinner
than
i
expected
happy
to
have
it
on
cask
not
sure
id
enjoy
this
as
much
at
much
cooler
of
a
temp
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
and
does
have
a
dark
coffeelike
malt
base
it
does
seem
slightly
watery
but
that
helps
it
be
drinkable
past
the
first
beer
despite
the
flavor
however
it
is
not
brewed
with
coffee
at
all
says
surlys
own
omar
it
makes
for
a
good
chance
of
pace
beer
if
youre
looking
to
switch
from
most
of
surlys
other
stronger
beers
if
they
canned
this
stuff
i
would
always
have
a
supply
in
my
fridge
to
bad
they
dont
bottle
or
can
this
great
beer
i
see
why
they
call
it
a
session

does
serve
a
nice
niche
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
just
a
average
english
mild
just
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
the
nose
was
good
but
the
flavors
were
just
lacking
however
this
beer
has
a
high
drinkability

on
the

after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

this
is
a
good
low

touch

only
a
kiss

wee
touch

well
carbonated
wouldnt
be
mistaken
for
an
english
dark
mild
but
thats
the
general
idea
one
of
the
better
american
mild
style
browns
light
flavorful
poundable
its
not
an
exciting
beer
which
milds
are
but
it
was
exciting
to
get
the
opportunity
to
taste
prepubescent
red
poppy
incredible
the
transformation
this
beer
goes
through
always
pleased
to
see
a
true
session
ale
though
this
one
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
flavorful
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
interesting
tasty
beer
at
the
abv
it
is
ok
to
have
a
couple
i
am
encouraged
by
beers
like
this
high
taste
quotient
and
low
abv
especially
since
i
have
to
drive
home
the
base
beer
for
red
poppy
growler
consumed
during
game
5
of
the
nab
finals
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
and
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
of
baked
bread
toffee
caramel
a
light
roast
and
a
subtle
nuttiness
the
flavor
displays
the
same
baked
bread
character
with
light
notes
of
toasted
and
nutty
malt
a
restrained
bitterness
is
evident
a
delicious
and
extremely
sessionable
beer
though
after
having
it
on
cask
at
churchills
and
at
the
real
ale
fest
i
doubt
any
tap
or
growler
rendition
will
truly
satisfy
me
i
believe
this
64oz
serving
will
go
down
quite
easily
d
the
flavors
didnt
exactly
excite
me
but
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
alcohol
allows
you
to
take
it
down
easily

not
great
either
d
didnt
know
this
beer
was

low

i
could
have
ordered
another
one
a
nice
session
pint
if
youre
at
port
very
nice
i
had
no
idea
until
i
started
doing
this
review
that
the
abv
was
so
low
which
makes
the
flavors
going
on
in
this
that
much
more
surprising
well
balanced
and
smooth
i
could
have
drank
this

there
hadnt
been

more
often

recommended
if
you
want
a
semilight
beer
or
you
plan
on
drinking
a
lot
of
it
nothing
special
but
not
bad
for
a
mild
ale
still
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
port
an
easy
drinker
with
a
mediumplus
body
good
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
was
well

and
seemed
fairly
tame
a
tasty
ale
that
suits
its
style
cheers
served
on
tap
at
pizza
port
san
clemente
the
beer
had
a
dark
copper
color
and
a
malty
aroma
there
was
a
slightly
burnt
malt
flavor
early
on
with
a
mild
hops
flavor
at
the
end
but
the
flavors
were
subdued
overall
nothing
outstanding
but
it
went
down
easily
and
paired
well
with
the
lahina
pizza
i
ordered
this
mild
ale
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
tan
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
layer
and
clung
to
and
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
very
low
sweetness
the
hops
were
mild
but
there
was
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
there
was
a
pleasant
lingering
malty
aftertaste
this
was
a
good
mild
overall
my
pal
eyechartbrew
tells
me
that
this
is
better
on
cask
i
concur
if
only
for
a
little
more
head
in
the
appearance
and
conditioning
in
the
body
nevertheless
a
solid
brew
an
easy
going
accompaniement
to
any
of
the
excellent
pizzas
and
at
3
2
its
a
relatively
safe
brew
if
youre
driving
like
i
was
i
had
this
beer
10204
at
pizza
port
in
solana
beach
the
beer
was
served
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
very
little
head
retention
from
the
bar
to
our
table
it
was
gone
the
flavor
is
sour
and
hoppy
with
mild
hop
floralness
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
a
bit
disappointing
i
was
expecting
something
stronger
but
instead
this
beer
had
the
force
of
an
average
pale
ale
i
would
even
describe
it
as
a
bit
weak
overall
there
is
a
definate
maltiness
but
it
lacaks
complexity
not
bad
but
i
doubt
id
ever
order
it
again
there
are
too
many
other
good
beers
from
pizza
port
to
waste
time
with
this
beer
straight
up
easy
drinker
and
good
beer
to
have
with
your
pizza
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
red
at
the
edges
the
head
is
minimal
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
suggestion
of
fruit
this
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
it
begins
with
some
sweet
malt
and
a
little
chocolateroastiness
just
a
little
not
like
in
a
robust
porter
the
finish
is
sweet
smooth
medium
to
light
body
overall
not
too
exciting
not
as
complex
as
i
would
like
i
will
need
to
retaste
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
watery
on
the
palate
it
is
mildly
sweet
and
has
a
nice
finish
this
is
a
craft
light
beer
probably
not
a
repeat
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
selection
a
true
session
beer
and
an
excellent
brown
ale
considering
its
not
a
real
favorite
style

mine

i
would
love
to
have
tried
the
competitors
in
this
category
o
was
expecting
more
of
an
english
brown
ale
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
get
a
mild
nice
smooth
flavors
that
are
pleasant
and
easy
to
enjoy
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
at
the
ends
from
the
malts
roasty
bitterness
is
advantageous
here
and
the
aftertaste
was
almost
nonexistent
in
a
good
way
drinkability
was
great
and
i
had
trouble
pacing
myself
with
this
each
sip
goes
down
without
any
fuss
while
being
satisfying
each
time
overall
a
nice
mild
with
just
a
little
sweetness
this
is
quite
good
this
probably
blows
away
most
milds
you
would
find
in

for
a
15
oz
pint
glass
they
called
it
a
brown
ale
but
clearly
more
in
the
english
tradition
just
what
i
needed
a
little
pick
me
up
that
wouldnt
knock
me
on
my
feet
a
good
find
o
i
think
my
first
mild
on
cask
i
quite
enjoyed
it
well
done
the
beer
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
small
khaki
colored
head
rather
nutty
with
plenty
of
toffee
and
a
mild
cocoa
note
might
even
be
a
touch
of
coffee
lots
of
toasted
malts
too
strong
nut

flavors
this
beer
is
really
driven
by
the
sweet
malt
character
a
little
bit
of
toast
and
some
mild
cocoa
this
one
really
surprised
me
overall
a
nice
english
mild
highly
drinkable
with
lots
of
flavor
otherwise
this
is
a
fairly
typical
sweet
malty
and
nutty
brown
ale
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a

the
beer
is
a
light
clear
brown
coloring
with
only
a
thin

clingy
white
surface
coating

of
very
sweet
nut
and
toffee
with
a
slight

are
a

watery
with

nutty
sweet
backbone
and
a
touch

cloying
finish
overall
not

conditioned

at
the
bangor

the

into

until
it
was
clear

copper
in

full

was
left
through
the
whole

a
small
aroma
if
toffee
malts
the
toasted
malts
appear
again
in
the
taste
as
well
as
some
grains
finished
with
a
small
hop
character
very
creamy
beer
has
no
carbonation
this
reminded
me
of
kilkenny
as
i
was
consuming
a
decent
beer
that
may
have
been
made
slightly
better
from
the
cask
overall
an
ok
beer
its
not
terrible
but
not
great
couldve
done
a
lot
better
with
it
especially
in
the
recipe
and
in
the
mash
fermentation
was
ok
but
it
doesnt
really
need
to
show
up
in
this
style

miss

the
beer

is
decent
it

a
dry

scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
special
roast
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
quaffable
dry
roasted
flavor
its
light
and
simplistic
but
highly
drinkable
there
is
a
bit
of
esters
in
the
finish
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
brown
ale
there
really
isnt
much
else
to
say
this
is
a
malty
but
slightly
nutty

beer
has
a
malty

the
beer
is

for
the

going

all
and
all
an
easy

ale
a
nice
brown
with
good
drinkability
nice
example
of
the
style
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
dark
reddishbrown
light
tan
head
it
was
really
smooth
and
had
a
bizarre
hint
of
coffe
that
stuck
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
like
it
was
spiked
with
a
porter
a
bit
dry
on
finish
a
tad
too
thin
imo
overall
an
agreeable
english
dark
mild
i
found
the
aromas
to
be
a
promising
start
but
fell
through
in
the
taste
nonetheless
this
has
the
definite
sessionable
quality
to
it
but
the
flavours
just
need
to
be
amped
a
tad
o
very
sessionable
this
isnt
outstanding
but
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
definitely
an
enjoyable

everything
just
a
little
light
tasting
pleasant
but
not

o
not
a
bad
drop
a
fairly
smooth
and
well
balanced
beer
but
a
little
bland
overall
overall
an
interesting
english
dark
mild
ale
has
some
grain
and
fruit
flavours
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
much
better
than
most
milds
i
have
had
however
it
is
5
abv
so
maybe
it
isnt
a
truetostyle
mild
overall
a
decent
brew
that
im
happy
to
drink
o
some
interesting
flavors
but
they
dont
really
go
together
and
ok
smell
but
overall
an
unimpressive
brown
ale
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
puffy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
pretty
much
only
of
toasty
maltgrains
there
is
a
slight
onion
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
toastyburnt
malt
and
a
slight
oniongarlic
flavor
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
as
it
stands
whistler
is
0
for
2
in
my
book
with
their
beers
i
dont
know
if
this
is
classified
right
as
an
english
dark
mild
ale
i
cant
really
say
but
it
is
a
simple
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
seems
more
like
a
smoked
beer
to
me
but
i
have
no
clue
i
have
had
other
beers
from
this
brewery
and
this
is
easily
the
best
one
they
make
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
brown
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
nutty
slightly
smokey
with
caramel
and
a
nice
vomity
note
ugh
fortunately
that
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
flavor
is
toasted
caramel
and
bread
with
a
whisper
of
smoke
and
a
mineral
water
finish
pretty
thin
with
prickly
carbonation
my
first
offering
from
this
brewery
and
im
moderately
impressed
more
of
a
nut
brown
ale
than
the
given
classification
but
whatever
its
an
easy
drinking
keep
em
comin
kind
of
beer
that
poor
mammoth
could
use
a
keg
of
this
or
so
i
would
imagine
drinkability
i
found
this
highly
drinkable
and
was
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
id
gladly
have
it
again
final
notes
a
tasty
nofrills
session
beer
that
would
pair
well
against
a
meal
or
for
a
night
at
the
bar
with
friends
nothing
really
special
but
i
can
see
myself
buying
it

had
a
bottle
of
this
back
in
sept
09
the
colour
was
a
very
dark
brown
with
no
head
the
aroma
was
quite
roasty
with
hints
of
day
old
coffee
and
bits
of
hops
on
the
palate
it
was
thin
and
had
some
lightly
roasted
malt
and
a
smidge
of
hops
but
all
in
all
it
was
rather
blah
drinkability
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
a
good
signature
brew
worthy
of
several
drinkability
is
pretty
good
really
slid
down
easily
if
not
the
most
exciting
beers
in
the
world
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
western
ca
wayyy
better
than
their
export
lager
regardless
im
sure
theyre
selling
truckloads
right
now
my
son
says
a
case
is
like
40
us
bucks
nuts
edit
noticing
my
rather
high
deviation
i
went
back
and
reviewed
the
bjcp
guidelines
for
this
style
as
an
english
brown
ale
11a
i
still
feel
this
beer
hits
the
mark
in
many
ways
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewer
but
thats
not
saying
too
much
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
a
good
dark
ale
a
little
too
watery
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
a
bit
questionable
everything
about
this
beer
seems
to
be
just
a
bit
off
it
might
not
be
a
bad
meat
tenderizer
but
beyond
that
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
the
bottle
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
brew
strong
aroma
of
sweet
nutty
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
syrup
and
mild
english
hops
palate
is
mild
dark
malt
with
a
pleasantly
sweet
nutty
character
a
bit
of
chocolate
syrup
and
some
mild
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
just
a
very
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
finish
is
smooth
and
moderately
sweet
the
body
is
creamy
and
smooth
but
just
a
touch
foamy
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
session
ale
and
of
a
style
that
i
dont
get
to
try
very
often
interesting
stuff
perhaps
this
appeals
to
a
crossover
crowd
but
this
did
nothing
for
me
i
normally
rate
decent
beers
with
a
low
abv
with
a
touch
more
drinkability
but
i
simply
did
not
want
another
after
this
one
thanks
bryan
altogether
i
like
this
one
it
is
to
me
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
this
much
when
i
picked
up
the
sixer
a
very
well
crafted
beer
well
done
grand

o
well
past
its

imo
thats
my

well

is
a
light
medium
slightly
watery
in
texture
carbonation
is
medium
low
and
gets
there
only
with
some
swirling
down
very
easy
to
drink
i
can
only
imagine
this
being
more
fantastic
with
cask
treatment
o
a
very
nice
low
abv
session
beer
much
more
flavor
than
anything
i
have
had
lower
than
4
so
far
the
cpj
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
lot
of
toffee
and
some
caramel
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
ton
of
toffee
caramel
cocoa
and
some
nuttyness
for
such
a
low
alcohol
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
especially
considering
the
low
abv
d
for
3
5
abv
this
is
an
amazing
accomplishment
real
flavour
and
truly
sessionable
cask
at
the
king

in

auburn
hues
and
two
fingers
of

are

vanilla

cream
pecanlike
sweetness
very
subtle
chocolatecocoa

a

hop
bite

almost
no

aromas
of
baking
yeast
mild
floral

and
molasses
develop
after

while
mouthfeel
is
soft
lighter
than
medium
low
carbonation
slight
spiciness
toward
the
finish
dryly
malted
and
lingering
aftertaste
this
benchmark
session
ale
displays
much
more
complexity
than
youd
expect
for
the
weight
a
winner
in
all
formats
and
grand
rivers
best
beer
if
you
ask
me
thanks
for
putting
this
on
rich
on
tap
at
volo
my
first
english
dark
mild
ale
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
when
i
ordered
this
came
out
a
light
brown
colour
with
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
toffee
deep
roasted
malt
nuts
and
some
floral
hops
taste
brings
all
of
this
together
nicely
with
a
mild
bitterness
i
didnt
realize
this
was
only
3
5
alcohol
when
i
was
drinking
it
but
it
was
quite
flavourful
i
really
should
have
drank
more
than
one
pint
and
ill
order
it
if
i
see
it
again
another
great
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
ontario
with
some
of
the
worst
labels
on
earth
overall
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
even
if
it
was
a
bit
onedimensional
proof
that
you
dont
need
a
high
abv
to
have
flavor
pretty
well
done
example
of
the
style
carefully
crafted
compared
to
most
ive
tried
thus
far
lots
of
flavour
and
its
great
fresh
this
brew
is
terrific
as
a
flavourful
session
works
well
on
those
nights
when
you
want
the
taste
of
a
dark
ale
but
without
the
weight
still
cant
get
over
the
abv
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
quite
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
with
some
light
toffee
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
fruity
ester
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
i
thought
this
one
really
packed
lots
of
character
while
maintaining
good
balance
d
500ml
is
a
good
serving
size
for
this
one
its
nice
to
see
a
lowabv
roasty
brew
although
this
isnt
in
the
league
of
other
session
delights
like
death
taxes
still
its
the
best
grand
river
brew
ive
had
so
far
cheers
i
dont
usually
like
light
beers
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprize
dark
colour
light
tan
head
one
to
two
fingers
with
minor
lace
and
a
wispy
surface
and
ring
smell
is
slightly
sweet
reminds
me
of
molasses
fresh
taste
did
i
mention
it
was
bottled
july
14th
and
purchased
from
the
brewery
mildly
hoppy
mildly
bitter
slightly
sweet
toasty
oats
honey
molasses
brown
sugar
although
tending
to
the
sweet
side
theres
nothing
cloying
about
this
its
a
very
nice
beer
overall
body
a
bit
thin
but
overall
mouthfeel
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
light
carbonation
but
regenerates
just
fine
with
a
swirl
even
to
the
lower
quarter
of
the
glass
low
alcohol
and
good
taste
make
this
a
terrific
sessional
im
impressed
sampled
fresh
from
a
growler
purchased
at
the
brewery
on
150108
deep
mahogany
body
sits
under
a
billowing
froth
of
beige
foam
excellent
head
retention
and
minute
lacing
throughout
the
drinking
experience
the
aroma
is
initially
roasted
barley
and
burnt
malts
it
is
also
quite
toasty
and
nutty
just
a
touch
of
vanilla
extract
and
mineral
the
flavour
profile
is
surprisingly
well
rounded
and
full
but
that
just
goes
to
show
you
that
full
flavoured
beers
dont
have
to
be
high
in
alcohol
this
beer
is
quite
full
of
sweet
burnt
malts
toasty
barley
quite
nutty
with
a
just
enough
of
a
hop
presence
to
create
a
perfect
balance
the
finish
is
dry
and
lingering
well
done
grand
river
brewing
d
a
very
good
ale
w
high
quaffability
that
is
hard
to
get
close
to
a
lot
of
flavor
for
such
a
small
beer
a
sessioner
you
wont
hesitate
to
order
more
than
one
of
if
possible
i
wish
i
had
more
milds
like
this
available
locally
thanks
grub
mill
race
mild
is
not
only
an
incredibly
well
made
ale
belonging
to
an
underappreciated
and
nearextinct
style
but
its
quite
simply
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
one
i
plan
to
revisit
again
and
again
and
why
not
in
sessions
to
brew
lowalcohol
beers
like
this
isnt
easy
there
is
really
no
room
for
error
in
my
eyes
grand
river
makes
none
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
ale
very
drinkable
with
a
solid
amount
of
flavour
much
like
a
light
porter
and
as
far
as
im
concerned
that
is
a
very
good
thing
would
love
to
knock
back
pint
after
pint
of
this
on
draft
and
am
jealous
of
those
who
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so
thanks
to
derek
i
have
a
few
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
that
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
trying
after
this
one
its
damn
good
stuff
im
a
fan
of
english
ales
but
i
generally
like
them
lighter
browns
and
reds
mostly
this
beer
really
surprised
me
all
in
pleasant
ways
id
quite
happily
drink
more
of
these
and
may
well
find
myself
doing
so
in
the
future
its
good
beer
thinner
medium
body
good
carbonation
its
a
bit
drying
as
well
the
low
abv
and
good
taste
of
this
one
make
it
almost
dangerously
drinkable
thanks
derek
d
quite
tasty
especially
considering
how
small
this
beer
is
good
session
beer
if
you
like
darker
ales
i
think
but
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
glad
i
dont
live
in
the
gta
id
be
in
trouble
if
this
was
on
tap
at
a
bar
near
my
place
good
on
tap
at
volo
not
as
good
as
other
milds
ive
had
but
a
fine
example
nonetheless
and
considering
their
rarity
in
these
parts
its
a
real
treat
dark
amber
body
with
a
sweet
aroma
malty
flavors
at
the
fore
with
caramel
coffee
and
a
hint
of
smoke
i
also
found
a
suprising
fruitiness
with
hints
of
apple
and
figs
in
both
the
nose
and
flavour
low
level
of
bitterness
like
other
people
have
said
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
this
is
a
good
a
reason
to
advocate
for
milds
on
cask
as
i
have
ever
seen
drinkability
is
great
a
light
ale
that
isnt
light
on
flavour
good
balance
solid
and
interesting
malt
base
absolutely
sessionable
grand
river
is
quickly
becoming
a
powerhouse
in
ontario
even
brewing
under
5
abv
some
pleasant
malty
and
floral
aroma
dark
colour
with
a
soapy
mocha
head
as
expected
in
a
cask
easy
drinking
mild
bitterness
a
bit
of
coffee
for
balance
and
taste
sessionable
and
worth
trying
but
about
what
you
can
get
out
of
a
low
abv
beer
ok
but
nothing
outstanding
had
this
again
six
months
later
at
volo
on
cask
and
was
mediocre
again
i
had
this
on
tap
2
5
years
later
at
the
golden
kiwi
and
it
was
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
and
appearance
noticed
a
milder
version
of
a
shwartzbier
d
very
drinkable
drinkable
and
clean
but
just
too
much
like
the
soso
dark
milds
from
fm
which
i
have
never
been
partial
to
sorry
to
break
up
the
lovein
but
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
effort
even
as
well
crafted
as
it
was
an
excellent
offering
from
this
brewery

overall
nice
introduction
to

even
if
this
one
is
not
exactly
a
typical
example
of
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
for
a
long
time
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
when
i
finally
got
chance
to
at
6
abv
this
is
strong
for
a
mild
but
it
works
well
its
very
drinkable
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
it
has
gained
such
a
good
reputation
strikingly
longlasting
creme
bruleecolored
head
in
contrast
to
a
no
less
striking
black
cherryred
body
visually
it
reminds
me
of
a
red
velvet
cupcake
and
the
smell
isnt
that
far
off
either
marshmallows
sweet
sherry
molasses
and
a
bit
of
licorice
come
through
plus
subtle
chocolate
and
peanuts
lots
of
figs
and
raisins
and
just
a
drop
of
maple
syrup
dark
deep
and
tempting
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
massive
nut
flavors
roasted
peanuts
and
pecans
dominate
though
they
are
neatly
wedded
to
a
dark
fruity
character
of
raisins
figs
cherries
and
dates
the
combination
reminds
me
in
a
way
of
peanut
butter
and
jelly
there
are
also
lovely
coffee
chocolate
and
sherry
notes
in
the
background
plus
somewhat
nondescript
bitter
hops
to
fence
everything
in
suitably
lush
and
smooth
with
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
of
burnt
hops
this
is
a
wonderfully
sweetyetbalanced
strong
ale
probably
very
versatile
with
food
especially
curries
cheese
and
chocolate
a
classic
when
it
is
on
form
a
good
beer
none
the
less
if
in
average
mood
ive
had
it
a
fair
number
of
times
and
have
rarely
been
disappointed
at
its
best
it
is
deep
and
complex
rich
and
fruity
yet
with
malty
chocolate
at
a
push
overtones
well
worth
seeking
out
it
tastes
like
a
6
so
you
know
what
you
ar
edrinnking
and
if
its
might
be
too
much
you
can
always
have
a
half
or
a
nip
the
aroma
gives
sensory
overload
the
taste
is
amazingly
rich
and
it
makes
it
difficult
to
understand
why
people
find
it
necessary
to
brew
high
gravity
beers
when
this
delivers
so
much
at
6
abv
had
three
pints
last
thursday
in
ye
olde
robin
hood
ironbridge
shropshire
still
a
wonderful
beer
in
cask
form
please
dont
let
the
bottle
sour
your
view
of
a
true
classic
weird
on
all
accounts
i
like
it
sarah
hughes
must
be
turning
over
in
her
grave
every
time
someone
drinks
a
bottle
of
this
beer
ill
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
believe
that
it
was
better
back
in
the
day
a
poor
choice
for
my
first
beer
of
2005
its
a
dead
cert
that
the
next
one
will
be
an
improvement
no
matter
what
i
pull
from
my
fridge
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
kind
of
ordinary
with
not
much
to
recommend
it
or
reject
it
the
flavor
is
certainly
mild
with
a
slight
roasty
presence
a
definite
cherrygrape
wininess
cardboardy
in
the
end
this
is
definitely
past
its
prime
certainly
musty
the
bodys
thinned
out
quite
a
bit
with
a
very
light
feel
flattish
carbonation
reminiscent
of
cask
i
wish
i
could
have
known
beforehand
rather
than
spending
3
on
a
drainpour
i
had
this
casked
a
long
time
ago
and
recall
it
being
very
good
ill
certainly
revisit
this
and
review
accordingly
it
is
a
cloudy
chocolatetybrown
color
with
little
carbonation
there
is
sweet
prunes
and
raisins
in
the
nose
as
well
as
a
grape
tinge
the
body
is
malty
and
syruppy
yet
slight
thin
it
tatses
of
some
caramel
and
fruit
with
a
metallic
tinge
and
some
winey
sourness
not
something
i
am
used
to
but
i
enjoyed
my
first
reaction
was
this
is
not
a
good
sign
my
chilled
bottle
gushed
a
bit
upon
opening
the
aroma
is
sour
and
lactic
doesnt
smell
bad
just
not
how
it
should
it
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
brown
head
it
is
quite
sour
like
a
flemish
brown
such
a
dead
ringer
for
a
sour
brown
that
it
almost
seems
like
the
lactic
character
is
on
purpose
is
it
this
would
be
how
the
old
ales
of
centuries
gone
past
would
taste
i
really
like
this
there
are
notes
of
burnt
raisin
and
roast
malt
here
as
well
it
is
very
well
carbonated
as
is
expected
from
this
deliciously
infected
bottle
quite
light
bodied
has
a
bit
of
molasses
as
well
i
probably
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
i
should
have
but
i
still
found
it
quite
pleasant
malt
dominated
lots
of
chocolate
vanilla
caramel
in
the
flavour
soft
round
texture
very
well
balanced
sweetish
and
rich
quite
nice
its
actually
a
beer
ive
been
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
for
a
while
and
even
though
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
it
was
a
still
a
nice

this
is
a
very
winelike
brew
in
a
way
none
ive
had
before
has
been
very
smooth
but
in
no
way
creamy
this
is
a
very
sultry
brew
i
cant
say
it
was
what
i
anticipated
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
certainly
a
pleasurable
break
from
the
norm
sarah
hughes
dark
ruby
on
cask
at
the
real
ale
festival
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
that
this
was
a
very
dark
maroon
thicker
head
that
picks
up
some
of
the
color
of
the
beer
fairly
clear
for
a
cask
conditioned
beer
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
dried
fruits
think
raisons
mixed
with
plums
the
taste
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
very
easy
to
sip
but
with
more
alcohol
than
id
have
expected
the
taste
was
initially
dried
fruits
from
the
malts
with
a
dryish
almost
red
wine
taste
toward
the
end
with
a
bare
hint
of
sourness
the
lads
and
i
all
thought
this
was
terrific
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
sees
it
on
cask
this
is
one
weird
beer
first
it
overflowed
the
glass
i
poured
it
into
no
it
exploded
like
a
volcano
while
overflowing
lots
of
bubble
with
this
one
light
fruit
smell
taste
starts
off
decent
with
a
taste
of
plums
and
raisins
then
falls
apart
there
is
a
sour
taste
on
the
finish
like
wine
gone
bad
not
again
for
this
guy
not
really
dark
ruby
looks
more
black
but
really
dark
brown
good
aroma
ginger
some
coffee
raisin
a
little
caramel
taste
is
odd
its
sour
it
didnt
smell
like
it
had
gone
bad
and
it
almost
tasted
like
it
was
supposed
to
be
that
way
i
actually
checked
the
other
ratings
to
make
sure
my
experience
fit
before
rating
to
make
sure
i
didnt
just
get
a
bad
bottle
odd
didnt
have
the
head
problem
though
okay
people
i
pour
this
beer
and
it
poured
out
a
very
dark
color
but
i
got
none
of
the
head
that
has
been
mentioned
my
fave
spot
just
got
this
from
their
distributor
last
week
dont
know
if
it
is
an
old
bottle
little
if
any
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
reminded
me
more
of
a
wine
than
of
a
beer
the
flavor
had
an
overiding
sour
taste
to
it
which
once
again
begs
the
question
are
they
trying
to
emulate
a
wine
quality
i
am
a
sucker
for
anything
that
says
dark
but
this
beer
is
unusual
worth
a
try
sure
i
liked
it
but
im
a
freak
gave
it
a
4
in
taste
for
creativity
just
dont
go
out
of
your
way
unless
you
are
daring
for
something
different
toddmay
06
overall
a
very
flavorful
and
tasty
light
beer
malt
rules
here
is
welcome
m
balanced
sensation
starts
more
sweet
than
bitter
but
the
end
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
should
od
im
slightly
torn
on
this
one
certainly
a
light
beer
with
character
not
bad
a
malt
cap
gun
instead
of
a
bomb
its
red
and
maybe
london
england
influenced
but
my
there
is
something
else
going
here
as
well
hopped
up
just
south
of
the
proverbial
nuts
yet
in
the
continental
way
earthy
floral
but
still
bitter
whatever
this
a
hell
of
a
session
bitter
and
id
love
to
be
able
to
prove
it
right
now
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
since
it
is
light
i
finally
found
a
light
beer
with
taste
i
believe
this
is
my
first
dark
mild
ale
if
this
is
characteristic
of
the
style
it
is
fairly
interesting
interesting
taste
and
feel
and
certainly
drinkable
color
is
amber
very
dark
some
reddish
notes
and
clear
practically
no
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malts
not
much
hops
maybe
some
fruits
in
the
aroma
cherry
not
sure
the
aroma
intensity
is
medium
but
for
a
light
beer
it
is
intense
taste
shows
caramel
with
a
very
subtly
bitterness
very
tasty
for
a
light
beer
thirst
quenching
too
thinbodied
d
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
really
keep
you
wanting
more
drinkability
very
good
would
make
a
nice
pub
session
beer
dreally
great
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
awesome
session
beer
just
something
you
could
hold
onto
all
night
clear
ruby

with
a
hefty
head
of
thick

with

peceptible
defect
for
a

o
a
good
effort
for
a
second

had
surprisingly
a
good
bit
going
on
not
sure
how
many
i
would
want
though

a
dense

is
grainy
toasty
mildly
smoky
and
has
a
touch
of
licorice
not
much
hop
character
is
present
complex
but
not
particularly
compelling
the
palate
has
the
complexity
of
the
nose
but
the
lightness
and
wateriness
thanks
to
this
being
a
second
runnings
beer
is
a
little
distracting
the
english
yeast
adds
some
nice
fruitiness
and
a
little
bit
of
a
body
but
not
quite
enough
light
in
body
mediumhigh
in
carbonation
drying
smoky
on
the
finish
this
is
solid
stuff
this
wasnt
bad
for
a
2nd
runnings
beer
but
it
could
have
ultimately
used
a
little
more
flavors
beside
burnt
roast
and
crisp
bitter
hops
i
mean
it
drank
ok
but
got
fairly
boring
after
a
bit
it
wasnt
bad
though
at
cleansing
the
palate
between
tulips
full
of
fred
from
the
wood
and
matt
d
easy
to
pound
which
is
a
great
characteristic
of
this
beer
haha
nice
to
drink
a
couple
of
glasses
and
not
feel
guilty
about
drinking
a
10
monster
great
for
a
session
ale
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
great
and
flavorful
session
beer
dark

deep
to
the

minimal

light

nutty

mild

taste
was
about
spoton
for
the
style
slightly
roasty
malts
nutty
pumpernickel
grassy
and
earthy
hoppiness
for
a
gentle
woody
bitterness
medium
body
simple
quite
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
to
use
a
cliche
expression
for
a
lower
abv
beer
perhaps
not
the
most
popular
style
of
beer
but
i
do
get
in
the
mood
for
a
good
dark
mild
every
once
in
a
while
so
this
was
nice
very
good
to
great
drinkable
beer
would
definitely
have
again
probably
one
of
my
favorite
dark
english
ales
highly
recommended
beer
is
nice
a
refreshing
not
a
dry
finish
at
all
nice
throughout
mildly
sweet
a
little
roasty
decent
id
have
it
again
this
brew
poured
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
red
hues
where
the
light
passed
through
very
little
head
on
this
mostly
due
to
the
pour
what
did
remain
was
on
the
yellow
side
of
offwhite
the
nose
on
this
one
was
pretty
roasty
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
up
front
i
get
those
sweet
malty
flavors
chocolate
and
a
little
fruit
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
there
are
some
earthy
notes
followed
up
by
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
the
carbonation
sits
on
the
high
side
making
this
brew
very
drinkable
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
wright
home
about
o
a
very
solid
brew
its
very
drinkable
and
packs
a
good
taste
to
boot
overall
awesome
beer
always
a
pleasure
to
session
any
ccb
beers
cheers
o
for
what
it
is
i
am
extremely
impressed
can
not
say
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
english
dark
mild
ales
but
i
can
say
el
lector
has
welcomed
me
to
the
style
overall
good
beer
overall
nice
to
see
ccb
putting
out
a
mild
ale
definitely
worth
a
shot
rich
looking
medium
brown
with
a
mild
cloudiness
about
it
rich
color
here
with
a
nice
head
of
off
white
which
hung
around
for
a
few
moments
before
settling
down
into
a
thin
film
the
aroma
was
light
medium
fruit
notes
apricot
maybe
with
a
hint
of
some
light
spice
and
tons
of
grain
more
of
the
same
on
the
taste
as
i
run
through
on
this
one
the
flavor
was
a
bit
lacking
for
me
nice
malt
profile
with
a
light
ouch
of
fruit
and
spice
but
not
nearly
strong
enough
of
a
profile
to
really
get
me
to
enjoy
it
smooth
mellow
carbonation
and
a
low
abv
made
it
nice
and
and
drinkabl

that
is
slightly

with
a
thin
layer
of
offwhite

aromas
of
light

sweetness
that
avoid
being

the

this

this
is

i
really
want
the

to
catch
on
to
this

and
i
really
want
ccb
to
start

producing

bottling
this

there
are

i
could
have
many
of

much

a
little
abv
drinkability
what
a
great
session
ale
i
dont
have
a
in
this
style
to
compare
to
but
i
enjoyed
it
looking
for
more
in
the
full

session
category
d
meh
not
my

ive
had
better

elsewhere

hops
in

i
was
expecting
more
roast
to
be
bang
on
the
style
carbonation
comes
through
more
aggressively
a
good
drinker
sessionable
as
i
can
have
this
and
head
back
to
whatever
i
was
doing
an
average
beer
overall
however
dark
colour
without
noticeable
head
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
only
4
abv
with
tons
of
flavor
packed
in
overall
this
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
full
flavor
and
low
alcohol
very
nice
skal
d
i
would
crush
tons
of
this
stuff
isnt
that
the
point
of
the
english
mild
mediumish
body
with
lightmedium
effervescence
a
touch
of
coffee
and
ash
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
quite
good
especially
if
you
are
having
several
this
is
an
interesting
beer
its
got
plenty
of
flavor
and
body

is

definitely
a

off

low

weak
roasty
aroma
and
flavour
sourish
and
thin
very
disappointing
as
my
expectations
were

will
need
to
rerate
a
fresh
bottle
or
cask
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
approacking
black
with
a
tan
head
looks
almost
like
a
stout
aromas
of
cocoa
and
some
bright
fruit
perhaps
raspberry
a
touch
of
treacle
and
a
round
maltiness
very
nice
taste
fruitier
than
expected
with
more
hints
of
chocolate
raspberry
and
quite
a
bit
spritzier
than
expected
as
well
this
settles
a
bit
and
the
long
fruity
chocolatey
malt
finish
lingers
the
slightest
bitt
chalky
at
the
end
quite
full
flavored
and
nice
to
see
it
in
a
low
abv
offering
smooth
and
spritzy
in
the
mouth
glad
i
picked
this
up
a
terrific
example
of
what
can
be
done
at
less
than
5
chocolatey
smooth

active
carbonation
that
tingle
in
the

and
lots
of
lace
dark

with

some
barrelled
raspberries
in
the
finish
this
would
be
a
staple
if
sold
locally
what
a
terrific
beer
for
those
of
you
who
think
you
know
what
a
good
mild
tastes
like
you
may
want
to
bring
your
taste
buds
with
you
to
this
session
theyve
packed
a
ton
of
flavor
into
a
this
lower
bodied
brew
initial
aroma
impresses
with
an
abundance
of
juicy
raisons
dates
molassas
malts
and
toastiness
flavors
continue
what
the
aromas
started
still
emphasizing
the
raisons
figs
and
plumbs
all
backed
up
with
a
rich
bready
yeasty
flavors
that
emphasizes
freshness
the
body
remains
light
allowing
the
beer
to
flow
easily
down
the
gullet
cleans
up
nicely
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
lingering
plumbs
and
figs
good
dark
milds
are
difficult
to
find
great
ones
such
as
this
are
greatly
impossible
explodes
out
of
bottle
and
pours
a
five
finger
brown
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
almost
black
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
port
nose
starts
with
a
dry
fermented
fruity
flavor
some

pricey
at

99
for
a
11oz

painesville
oh
this
made
quite
an
impression
on
me
it
poured
much
darker
that
i
thought
it
was
going
to
in
fact
it
nearly
poured
black
as
ink
pouring
a
very
dark
brown
it
had
a
caramel
coloured
foamy
head
that
actually
hung
around
for
3
minutes
or
so
quite
impressive
indeed
the
smell
of
this
ale
is
absolutely
amazing
very
sweet
and
chocolatey
with
a
good
bit
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
perhaps
some
fruit
and
berries
as
well
the
taste
was
equally
incredible
loads
of
sweet
malt
present
and
nearly
devoid
of
hops
although
they
are
of
course
present
in
small
quantities
i
am
simply
blown
away
by
this
ale
it
is
entirely
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
i
will
definately
buy
this
again
in
the
future
d
high
a
sweet
easy
down
only
the
alcohol
flavor
knocks
it
down
a
little
aroma
is
full
of
blueberries
and
dark
fruits
black
in
color
with
a
bunch
of
tan
streaks
and
bubbles
pretending
to
be
a
head
fore
is
dry
black
licorice
raisins
and
some
prune
notes
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
it
is
a
fruity
bitterness
more
citric
than
hoppy
increibly
still
beer
with
virtually
no
carbonation
drinkability
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
mild
particularly
in
the
mouthfeel
area
i
nevertheless
really
enjoyed
this
complex
and
unusual
beer
md
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
but
constantly
fed
by
lovely
creamy
bubbles
the
body
is
pretty
light
true
to
the
standards
of
a
mild
and
the
flavour
is
also
mild
to
my
surprise
actually
overall
this
bottleconditioned
version
is
not
a
bad
attempt
at
all
but
i
fear
the
more
colourful
fruitiness
and
richer
maltiness
as
in
the
cask
version
are
not
packed
in
the
bottle
the
end
result
is
a
softer
and
cleaner
mild
though
still
quite
drinkable
16
9

no

dating
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
kmpitz2
said
the
aroma
is
just
like
fresh
raisins
weird
the
flavor
is
mostly
comprised
of
that
fresh
raisin
thing
tasty
in
a
weird
way
i
wouldnt
really
call
this
a
mild
but
its
still
good
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
this
beer
pours
a
black
i
think
it
is
a
super
dark
amber
color
with
a
4
finger
head
that
falls
rather
slowly
the
nose
is
interesting
its
almost
like
ground
up
raisins
right
out
of
the
little
red
box
the
flavor
is
nice
with
quite
a
bit
of
raisin
flavor
along
with
a
kind
of
pulpy
fruityness
on
the
end
interesting
the
feel
is
a
light
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
i
like
it
overall
this
is
very
refreshing
and
fruity
im
not
sure
if
it
fits
the
style
as
i
have
had
very
few
of
them
i
do
like
it
drinkability

theres
no
modesty
here
this
is
a
big
un
to
say
the
least
they
ought
to
add
a
new
style
from
mild
ale
to
wild
ale
gales
festival
mild
is
a
better
than
average
english
dark
mild
that
has
flavor
to
spare
its
whole
isnt
quite
equal
to
the
sum
of
its
parts
however
it
could
stand
to
be
more
tightly
knit
on
the
palate
i
did
enjoy
this
little
11
oz
bottle
though
and
will
probably
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
im
betting
that
its
much
better
oncask
i
paid
4
50
for
a
500
ml
bottle
what
a
burn
i
think
that
this
is
a
splendid
ale
of
a
at
least
outside
the
uk
unusual
style
it
is
quite
expensive
approx
us4
for
50
cl
but
well
worth
the
money
taste
hops
bite
first
then
back
away
malt
is
prevalent
carbonation
high
fizz
aplenty
too
aplenty
its
like
a
soda
pop
up
in
here
tart
too
nothing
but
fizz
and
sour
not
terribly
pleasant
im
going
to
sit
with
this
for
a
bit
to
find
something
to
enjoy
in
it
aint
happening
eh
not
liking
it
spent
5
49
before
taxes
for
a
500ml
bottle
of
mild
ale
thats
not
the
tiniest
bit
mild
not
worth
it
a
bit
of
a
vinous
character
peeps
up
toward
the
end
but
its
too
late
this
was
a
waste
nothing
to
get
festive
about
or
anything
for
i
did
nothing
but
wince
and
grimace
ugh
skip
skip
gales
altogether
if
youre
wise
wiser
than
i
let
my
sacrifice
not
be
in
vain
deep
mahogany
with
very
little
carbonation
never
really
forms
a
true
head
but
the
dark
color
is
quite
attractive
in
this
mild
ale
nose
features
notes
of
chocolate
toffee
coffee
and
hops
the
complex
flavor
profile
exhibits
mild
chocolate
malt
raisins
toffee
roasted
coffee
beans
and
some
balancing
relatively
citric
bitter
hops
on
the
finish
somewhat
vinous
and
very
well
rounded
smooth
almost
noncarbonated
mouthfeel
just
like
what
one
might
find
in
a
caskconditioned
pint
of
mild
super
drinkable
low
abv
huge
flavor
a
pleasure
to
drink
with
the
designation
mild
ale
i
expected
something
very
low
key
and
conservative
this
beer
surprised
me
at
the
first
sip
a
citric
tartness
followed
by
a
bright
carameltoffee
malt
some
apple
flavors
drifting
about
sharply
carbonated
finished
a
little
dry
and
clean
quite
the
lively
beer
with
a
lot
of
personality
love
to
try
this
with
some
beef
stew
did
i
say
wow
special
recomendation
from
shiredave
this
one
was
quite
a
beauty
after
pouring
just
a
little
of
the
beer
a
huge
head
appeared
huge
a
craggy
with
tons
of
bubbles
however
with
a
little
patience
it
receded
allowing
me
to
pour
the
entire
pint
it
was
a
rich
dark
mahogany
which
was
opaque
except
for
a
slight
hint
of
brown
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
was
very
odd
indeed
the
aroma
was
do
intated
by
huge
notes
of
prune
and
vinous
red
wine
flavors
and
a
fair
bit
of
peatiness
taste
was
sweet
and
tart
with
raspberry
and
cranberry
flavors
competing
against
a
slight
smokey
undertow
and
that
same
tart
mustiness
that
you
would
see
in
a
lambic
there
was
just
the
barest
hint
of
some
slight
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
not
overly
carbonated
as
this
is
obviously
bottle
conditioned
and
damn
proud
of
it
if
i
ever
saw
this
on
cask
i
would
get
it
in
a
second

quite

it

a

definitely
pick

a
fan
of

my
trusted
seller
recommended
this
dark

i
found

have
held
better

a
good
taste

mildly

heartier
than
most

o
overall
a
decent
session
dark
beer
the
finish
is
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
but
the
overall
flavor
is
certainly
interesting
this
beer
was
not
bad
but
it
was
far
from
outstanding
devils
backbone
brewing
has
better
offerings
overall
its
classic
devils
backbone
flavorful
but
the
carbonation
on
this
is
just
way
too
much
if
this
was
dialed
down
to
let
that
the
light
toasty
malt
backbone
to
come
through
it
would
be
really
fantastic
good
bloody
hell
it
was
marvelous
i
am
sure
i
could
wax
lyrical
about
toffee
and
cocoa
notes
and
the
merest
hint
of
spicy
hops
but
why
when
it
was
the
sheer
pleasure
the
beer
bought
me
which
is
the
abiding
memory
d
cream
of
fergus
is
an
easytoquaff
englishstyle
session
ale
nuff
said
d
a
very
good
brown
ale
that
is
approachable
with
moderate
hoppiness
and
with
a
tocuh
of
peaty
smokiness
that
lends
a
great
deal
of
uniqueness
also
notable
for
a
great
deal
for
a
growler
fill
drinkability
kudos
to
an
american
brewer
trying
to
a
style
thats
far
too
often
overlooked
in
favor
of
bigger
bolder

this

simply
a

and
overall

dark
mild
ale
great
tasting
flavors
are
light
and
almost
lacking
i
get
a
slight
nuttiness
and
roasty
element
on
the
palate
but
the
light
body
is
deceiving
theres
enough
taste
here
to
remain
drinkable
and
sessionable
this
one
is
faithful
to
the
classic
english
brown
ale
style
and
pretty
decent
overall
a
quite
enjoyable
sessionbrown
ale
from
nola
a
good
beer
to
have
around
and
something
i
will
keep
in
my
fridge
for
sure
o
a
pretty
flavorful
malty
session
beer
in
some
circles
its
referred
to
as
the
slow
down
brown
due
to
the
low
amount
of
alcohol
o
overall
pretty
average
english
ale
here
not
much
going
for
it
truthfully
pours
a
rubytinged
brown
with
a
very
thin
head
smells
like
caramel
toast
and
chocolate
smell
a
bit
of
gummy
bears
in
there
too
flavor
is
up
front
pale
malts
with
a
smack
of
the
dark
malts
thrown
in
the
mix
toast
and
chocolate
hop
presence
is
very
subdued
finishes
with
an
interesting
tartness
but
way
too
much
jelly
in
the
finish
jelly
kills
it
is
this
made
by
saint
arnold
mouthfeel
could
be
fuller
and
with
more
subdued
carb
overall
this
can
be
pounded
at
this
abv
but
its
lacking
finesse
all
around
too
much
jelly
flavor
weird
o
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
amazing
love
gravity
some
nice
dark
malt
character
although
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
flavor
poured
from
tap
intp
pint
at
the
pickle
in
shreveport

nolas
answer
to
abita
amber
another
local
session
dark
it
has
a
nice
initial
punch
of
flavor
for
a
session

the
feel

are
clearly
off
for
my
complete
review

o
not
a
huge
fan
on
brown
ales
but
it
was
good
the
sweet
dairy
taste
was
almost
upsetting
the
beer
has
great
flavor
for
a
session
beer
and
has
good
drink
ability
overall
a
great
beer
probably
my
favorite
beer
in
this
category
out
of
our
great
state
will
definitely
pick
it
up
often
and
really
gives
me
a
good
opinion
of
nola
cheers
wheres
the
hopitoulas
nola
this
is
my
first
english
dark
mild
ale
but
i
think
a
label
like
american
mild
brown
would
be
more
fitting
its
like
a
brown
ale
just
lighter
there
are
some
weird
things
in
the
flavor
but
ultimately
this
is
good
this
is
designed
to
be
a
session
beer
and
it
definitely
serves
that
purpose
for
that
it
gets
a
bump
in
its
overall
score
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
retains
well
but
there
isnt
much
lacing
there
appears
to
be
plenty
of
carbonation
theres
an
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
fairly
mild
there
are
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
slightly
nutty
it
has
a
pleasant
sweet
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
not
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
light
clean
and
slightly
creamy
its
very
easy
to
gulp
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
easily
sessionable
and
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
a
few
pints
of
this
a
very
well
rounded
beer
gives
a
nice
aftertaste
of
toasted
bread
and
hints
of
cocoa
goes
down
easy
with
plenty
of
flavor
you
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
o
pretty
damn
good
out
of
the
can
really
different
from
the
tap
very
interesting
and
dark
version
of
a
brown
this
beer
tasted
like
the
crust
from
a
pie
my
grandmother
used
to
make
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
i
didnt
think
the
sweetness
was
a
negative
aspect
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
good
to
go
along
with
the
sweetness
it
was
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
it
finished
dry
and
quickly
enough
to
not
cause
aversion
i
have
had
two
excellent
beers
from
nola
but
this
is
a
major
let
down
not
something
i
would
recommend
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
really
did
not
stick
out
much
either
i
could
session
but
after
being
blown
away
by
flambeau
red
this
was
a
let
down
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
and
get
the
red
d
come
on

alcohol
its
amazingly
drinkable

and

supremely
drinkable
id
finish
a
growler
of
this
dvery
drinkable
went
back
for
more
soon
after
very
nice
session
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
not
much
head
but
a
bit
kinda
looks
like
coke
almost
smells
very
good
a
very
nice
smelling
beer
lots
of
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
tastes
great
lots
of
roasted
malts
a
bit
smokey
great
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
a
solid
brown
ale
for
sure
first
time
this
dark
of
a
beer
has
been
such
a
sessionable
beer
not
a
bad
brown
but
nothing
special
served
with
a
nice
creamy
fine
light
tan
head
and
some
lace
color
was
a
clear
dark
garnet
brown
traditonal
nut
brown
flavor
witha
bit
of
dark
ripe
fruit
and
a
bit
of
acid
body
was
a
tad
thin
and
carbonation
was
a
little
fizzy
roasty
slightly
sweet
finish
of
medium
length
note
on
11910
i
received
an
email
from
the
brewery
concerning
this
review
they
stated
that
it
sounded
like
a
an
issue
with
the
carbonation
level
of
the
beer
and
invited
me
to
try
some
directly
from
the
brewery
next
time
i
am
in
the
area
props
to
them
for
proactive
customer
service
i
will
definitely
try
some
more
of
their
beer
next
time
i
am
down
south
o
its
an
ok
beer
to
be
honest
i
dont
really
dont
see
the
appeal
of
this
particular
beer
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
another
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
it
was
served
up
with
a
spicy
plate
of
red
beans
and
rice
this
beer
would
be
great
for
any
spicy
dish
d
good
but
could
have
been
a
bit
more
bitter
it
tasted
rather
average
fairly
nutty
mild
tobacco
leaf
dryness
husky
malts
somewhat
crisp
with
a
slight
bite
ample
carbonation
almost
a
touch
too
much
for
a
mild
ale
still
its
a
simple
yet
refreshing
beverage
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
d
very
drinkable
at
3
9
but
not
superinteresting
if
i
were
in
louisiana
id
stick
to
the
blonde
i
think
this
was
actually
the
growler
that
kicked
last
at
a
party
i
held
recently
on
tap
at
the
avenue
pub
in
new
orleans
feb

2010
pours
a
dark
brown
with
slight
beige
head
good
dark
malts
of
caramel
chocolates
and
some
nuts
medium
body
and
carbonation
good
finish
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
nice
offering
in
my
humble
opinion
cheers
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
but
lends
itself
to
a
topnotch
session
brew
d
if
i
lived
in
the
area
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
excellent
flavor
and
übersessionable
strength
honestly
thought
this
was
a
bigger
dark
lager
schwarzbier
or
similar
what
a
surprise
the
type
of
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
sometimesfinicky
beerloving
wife
approved
of
and
my
beernovice
brother
proclaimed
as
really
good
a
night
after
hed
completely
rejected
my
similar
choice
from
abita
id
say
nola
has
a
winner
with
this
one
rjt
overall
a
lot
lighter
than
it
looks
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
value
as
well
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
light
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
isnt
very
complex
it
actually
seems
like
a
pretty
basic
brown
but
it
is
done
right
very
solid
and
satisfying
all
around
and
quite
sessionable
a
great
go
to
beer
if
in
the
mood
for
this
style
d
very
good
american
brown
ale
this
would
be
my
goto
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
this
style
it
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
that
is
quite
all
right
when
you
are
drinking
in
this
hot
louisiana
weather
you
could
session
this
beer
it
comes
across
that
light
d
i
couldve
had
several
of
these
beers
if
i
had
time
to
be
their
longer
great
effort
as
i
couldnt
ask
for
more
from
a
local
brewer
as
a
side
note
i
had
this
at
lagers
in
metairie
it
was
closer
to
what
other
reviewers
describe
when
i
had
it
at
the
barley
oak
it
wasnt
even
like
the
same
beer
so
somethings
wrong
over
there
this
is
a
brand
new
brewery
not
sold
by
bottle
yet
and
is
only
sold
in
new
orleans
and
its
the
only
brewery
currently
located
in
the
city
limits
of
new
orleans
its
a
brewery
that
represents
the
rebuilding
of
the
city
and
the
movement
to
make
the
big
easy

overall
its
an

for

and
the
hot
humid
sticky
climate
of

i
could
drink
this
all

and
not

bogged
down
despite
the
excellent

overall
finally
a
wonderful
beer
to
replace
the
boring

this
beer
along
with
their
blonde
has
become
my
everyday
beer
when
i
go
to
bars
d
call
me
a
homer
but
look
at
my
abita
reviews
before
you
do
this
beer
was
fantastic
the
taste
was
great
a
well
crafted
and
flavorable
brown
ale
that
will
become
a
staple
in
my
draft
diet
until
they
release
the
bottles
taste

good

excellent
and
unexpectedly
interesting
representative
of
mild

o
very
good
example
of
style
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
with
enough
character
to
enjoy
on
its
own
yet
reserved
enough
to
allow
long
conversations
and
light
food
to
take
center
stage
o
a
rather
nice
beer
not
a
huge
mainstream
style
in
fact
my
first
venture
into
it
but
quite
appreciated
to
have
versus
the
tried
and
true
styles
produced
today
o
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
given
its
light
body
and
low
alcohol
content
while
also
being
quite
flavorful
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
light
version
of
a
good
porter
overall
this
is
a
definitely
drinkable
and
tasty
mild

love
dark

with

flavorful
for

mild
ale
this
is
my
second
celt
experience
ale
and
im
impressed
an
interesting
take
on
the
dark
mild
ale
style
the
taste
starts
out
on
the
sweet
side
but
then
the
coffee
grinds
kick
in
with
a
low
bitterness
tying
it
all
together
at
the
end
this
has
the
bold
character
of
something
bigger
than
a

sometimes
youve
just
gotta
dive
in

relatively
low
flavor

that
ashy

through
pretty
considerably
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
its
not
overwhelming
nothing
about
this
is
as
mild
as
it
may
be
thats
probably
how
it
should
be
given
the
style
name
and
the
abv
the
feel
is
pretty
watery
thin
but
this
is
an
excellent
sessionable
dark
beer
without
a
doubt
i
know
this
is
classified
as
an
english
dark
mild
ale
but
this
really
tastes
like
a
porter
to
me
which
is
not
at
all
a
bad
thing
i
heard
that
this
tasted
like
black
water
although
im
assuming
this
is
the
second
runnings
of
something
like
4d
or
the
barleywine
base
ive
had
a
pint
of
this
before
at
hopcat

bought
a
variety
pack
of
guinness
beers
all
four
varieties
were
awesome
i
could
be
crazy
but
drinking
this
side
by
side
with
smithwicks
winter
spirit
i
think
they
are
literally
the
same
beer
same
colour
same
flavor
etc
not
a
bad
beer
but
sooooo
many
us
craftbeers
are
better
poured
out
of
can
into
an
english
pub
glass
i
got
a
nice
thick
twofinger
head
the
color
was
a
nice
dark
red
the
smell
was
sweet
malty
and
slight
pumpkin
spice
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
i
loved
the
malty
taste
with
the
sweet
finish
tastes
like
a
more
flavorful
version
of
guinness
draught
though
its
not
a
nitro
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
will
buy
it
again
if
i
get
the
chance
has
malt
bready
spice
aroma
dark
almost
black
and
ruby
colored
body
has
a
thick
two
fingered
foamy
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
much
like
the
guinness
draught
in
taste
but
has
a
maltier
presence
and
thinner
feel
mild
spiciness
leaves
a
smooth
creamy
feeling
there
is
not
a
ton
of
stuff
going
on
here
the
good
looks
and
mouth
cant
really
offset
the
blah
aroma
and
not
overly
interesting
flavors
overall
generous
what
this
beer
isnt
generous
anything
the
can
is
a
little
bigger
than
average
i
guess
inoffensive
pretty
boring
beer
im
almost
positive
the
smithwicks
winter
beer
that
came
in
the
same
christmas
pack
is
going
to
be
identical
ill
give
it
a
legit
shot
though
as
for
this
ale
itd
be
generous
of
me
to
describe
it
as
average
really
sharp
way
to
carbonated
pleasant
after
taste
a
reddish
brown
ale
the
head
is
off
white
and
medium
in
size
producing
a
delicate
lace
mother
smell
is
malt
forward
some
fleshy
fruit
and
bread
in
the
aroma
clean
flavor
unassuming
and
straightforward
the
generous
ale
is
an
easy
drink
beer
medium
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
beer
poured
a
clear
brownish
amber
with
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
only
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
is
bland
and
the
taste
carries
a
tinge
of
spice
overall
its
ok
quality
product
as
always
from
guinness
update
im
having
my
second
one
and
im
enjoying
it
much
more
thatn
the
first
the
flavor
seems
to
be
more
present
this
time
btw
this
is
from
a
can
a
plus
in
my
opinion
and
nonnitro
i
think
nitro
would
have
made
this
even
more
enjoyable
i
am
a
huge
guinness
fan
so
i
must
disclose
that
fact
the
generous
ale
is
like
a
red
ale
version
of
the
original
it
is
delicious
it
has
a
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
start
and
a
malty
smooth
finish
it
has
a
nice
amber
to
caramel
color
with
a
surprising
amount
of
clarity
the
only
issue
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
it
isnt
more
readily
available
overall
ok
ale
will
probably
not
buy
a
case
but
will
drink
it
when
it
is
included
in
a
guinness
mixed
assorted
case
rjt
thinner
body
than
expected
a
little
messy
and
not
as
clean
as
expected
a
little
tiny
too
many
dark
fruit
flavors
not
enough
toasty
and
biscuit
notes
sweet
yet
balanced
kind
of
like
an
underbaked
biscuit
with
fig
jam
on
it
and
maybe
a
touch
of
butter
really
thins
out
on
the
finish
semidry
but
would
benefit
from
being
dried
definitely
needs
more
body
o
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
not
being
too
huge
in
this
style
it
seems
my
bottle
was
more
skunky
than
it
should
be
it
came
from
a
friend
who
got
it
in
this
years
guinness
variety
pack
overall
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
next
time
drinks
fine
out
of
a
pint
glass
i
liked
that
my
pour
created
a
dense
thick
twoplus
fingers
of
tan
head
that
sat
defiantly
atop
the
beer
refusing
to
subside
and
allow
me
access
color
was
a
deep
mahogany
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
light
spiciness
to
accompany
a
malty
bready
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
like
anise
biscotti
if
that
makes
sense
finish
was
semidry
it
was
tasty
but
one
was
enough
it
just
seemed
to
lack
oomph
reddish
brown
with
ample
head
mild
caramel
in
the
nose
with
bready
undertones
and
a
faintness
hop
hop
very
clean
some
smoothness
mildy
crisp
with
a
moderate
sized
body
toasted
grain
hint
of
roastiness
grape
skin
slightly
metallic
slightly
sharp
bitterness
kiss
of
caramel
wet
body
bone
dry
finish
not
sure
what
to
think
here
not
much
of
a
winter
ale
of
body
nor
strength
i
guess
i
expected
a
bit
more
just
seems
a
bit
overly
processed
poured
into
a
12
oz
sam
adams
glass
clear
deep
copper
with
a
very
shortlived
creamy
white
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
limited
with
a
malt
sweetness
that
didnt
have
any
identifiable
notes
taste
is
about
the
same
theres
a
nondescript
malt
sweetness
but
nothing
distinctive
about
it
almost
no
carbonation
its
a
beer
that
has
the
form
of
an
english
mild
but
not
the
depth
you
would
expect
overall
a
tasty
irish
red
ae
o
a
boring
beer
little
flavor
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
satisfying
perhaps
by
taste
buds
are
rough
and
lacking
in
subtlety
but
i
taste
no
different
between
this
and
the
draught
so
if
you
like
very
dry
beers
that
leave
more
of
an
impression
of
flavor
than
flavor
itself
this
is
right
up
your
alley
since
this
tastes
just
like
the
draught
however
im
not
sure
of
the
point
of
this
brew
cheers
the
aftertaste
is
nice
and
overall
its
a
good
experience
like
most
guinness
products
it
is
an
underrated
session
beer
overall
good
beer
picked
up
from
a
variety
pack
i
saw
at
the
store
easily
money
well
spent
considering
the
other
gems
that
came
along
with
this
one
if
you
see
it
definitely
worth
your
attention
drink
and
enjoy
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
of
this
macrobrewery
offering
o
not
a
great
beer
but
neither
is
it
bad
i
wouldnt
buy
a
mix
pack
just
for
this
but
if
you
end
up
with
some
it
is
a
pleasant
session
ale

overall
ok
didnt
expect
too
much
so
not
overly
disappointed
could
do
2
or
3
of
these
overall
nothing
to
run
out
and
get
seconds
but
not
a
bad
winter
ale
is
it
not
well
known
that
the
guinness
family
of
english
origin
fought
against
the
repeal
of
the
act
of
union
and
thus
against
irish
independence
from
england
that
arthurs
eldest
son
was
a
member
of
the
orange
order
that
they
were
not
exactly
kind
to
the
irish
catholics
that
made
up
the
majority
of
their
work
force
in
fact
during
the
1930s
guinness
employed
over
12000
men
at
st
james
gate
close
to
10
percent
of
the
entire
male
population
of
dublin
and
it
wasnt
until
the
1960s
that
a
catholic
worker
was
allowed
to
enter
management
things
may
have
changed
but
to
note
arthurs
commitment
to
the
welfare
of
his
employees
the
community
certainly
raises
some
questions
in
my
mind
on
the
other
hand
being
an
openminded
person
who
looks
at
all
aspects
of
a
situation
i
do
have
to
acknowledge
that
at
least
until
the
1960s
political
and
religious
hierarchies
existed
throughout
ireland
england
and
the
rest
of
europe
lest
we
not
forget
nazi
germany
o
much
better
than
the
black
lager
this
is
a
decent
seasonal
english
ale
wish
the
malt
character
were
less
roastedcharred
finish
is
pretty
harsh
sourness
is
also
a
bit
odd
a
pleasant
afternoon
ale
lowno
hop
character
the
mineralastringency
is
interesting
overall
a
red
in
the
vein
of
newcastles
werewolf
but
a
bit
more
substantial
and
more
agreeable
reviews
dont
seem
too
enthusiastic
to
be
fair
its
still
quite
drinkable
just
dont
come
into
it
expecting
something
radically
different
from
the
guinness
mantra
o
i
was
excited
to
try
something
different
from
guinness
but
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
that
being
said
ill
still
take
it
before
lots
of
things
and
dont
regret
at
least
trying
it
overall
drinkability
easily
my
least
favorite
guinness
o
not
a
fan
it
doesnt
flat
out
suck
per
se
but
id
much
rather
use
the
remaining
bottle
from
the
pack
in
a
recipe
than
drink
it
i
can
see
this
being
fantastic
in
a
beef
stew
or
chili
at
least
14
9
oz
can
poured
into
an
english
pint
drinkable
winter
ale
but
for
me
a
little
too
similar
to
smithwicks
and
their
winter
ale
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
coded
bottle
date
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
large
tan
head
which
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
bread
malts
nutty
smells
and
a
little
hops
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
good
enough
a
little
bitterness
some
nice
bread
malts
and
a
little
toffee
owhile
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
appealing
the
light
body
tapers
the
flavor
id
try
again
but
likely
wont
buy
this
if
better
beers
are
available
smooth
with
a
hint
of
nutty
earthy
malts
light
raisin
bread
aftertaste
vague
fruity
esters
very
light
and
easy
drinking
with
lower
carbonation
true
to
style
overall
its
not
a
bad
dark
mild
as
long
as
you
know
what
youre
drinking
i
am
kind
of
surprised
to
see
this
listed
as
a
mild
ale
at
5
6
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
hazelnut
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
bready
taste
is
malty
toasty
light
hops
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
notes
i
was
drawn
in
by
the
label
and
hopeful
for
something
better
from
this
brewer
unfortunately
for
me
at
least
this
will
fade
into
the
distance
as
a
forgotten
beer
you
know
youre
a
ticker
when
youll
buy
a
guinness
12pack
simply
because
it
has
a
new
offering
in
it
guilty
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
smoky
topaz
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
wan
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
dark
greens
light
old
maple
syrup
sweet
barley
and
biscuit
things
are
even
more
bland
than
english
milds
reputations
occasionally
demand
the
taste
is
a
mess
of
soapy
grassy
lightlycaramely
biscuit
harumph
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
limp
offering
one
that
certainly
doesnt
deserve
a
12pack
feature
debut
though
imagining
this
stuff
in
its
own
sixer
is
even
more
offensive
so
yeah
guinness
can
do
better
o
this
one
wasnt
complex
by
any
means
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
solid
session
choice
its
like
a
lighter
tasting
ale
version
of
guinness
draught
overall
a
simple
but
respectable
beer
with
a
little
signature
guinness
type
flavor
generous
ale
actually
was
a
bit
like
smithwicks
but
lighter
bodied
more
roasted
and
hoppier
this
makes
a
solid
choice
for
a
session
beer
would
pair
well
with
smoked
or
grilled
cheddarwurst
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
an
off
white
filmy
head
smell
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
and
coffee
and
a
sweet
candy
like
background
the
taste
is
a
little
metallic
and
has
dark
bitter
coffee
flavor
with
an
earthy
hop
flavor
its
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
guinness
i
kind
of
expected
something
gimicky
like
their
black
lager
but
this
is
way
better
pours
a
nice
ruby
reddish
brown
topped
with
a
frothy
ivory
head
that
holds
good
retention
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
on
its
way
down
aromas
are
yeast
grain
metallic
earthy
woodsy
tastes
are
spicy
earthy
some
roast
more
bitter
than
expected
metallic
burnt
caramel
some
mild
earthy
pine
on
the
finish
thinner
body
with
a
dry
finish
from
the
roasted
barley
overall
somewhat
different
not
what
i
expected
but
actually
quite
pleasant
o
my
first
exposure
to
this
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
have
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
not
a
holiday
brew
but
interesting
in
its
own
right
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
dont
know
that
id
rush
to
buy
it
again
but
glad
i
had
it
overall
i
actually
like
this
beer
very
much
it
is
definitely
a
winterstyle
beer
but
isnt
overwhelmingly
dark
heavy
or
spicy
it
seems
to
be
easily
sessionable
with
just
enough
hoppiness
and
spiciness
to
give
it
a
little
kick
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
overall
thought
it
had
real
possibility
of
being
a
good
guinness
beer
but
it
was
alright
was
hoping
for
better
o
very
nice
brew
here
lighter
in
body
then
guinness
draught
but
without
the
creamyness
makes
for
a
light
and
flavorful
brew
that
i
def
enjoyed
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
pours
a
dark
but
translucent
brown
with
short
beige
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
and
a
touch
of
bitters
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
holiday
brew
it
is
nevertheless
very
enjoyable
and
reminiscent
of
their
smithwicks
labeled
ale
overall
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
along
the
lines
of
a
rich
and
tasty
british
mild
but
what
im
tasting
is
an
uninspired
english
style
amberred
ale
this
just
might
be
approachable
to
the
newbie
crowd
but
to
me
it
just
seems
hohum
not
to
mention
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
winter
ale
with
holiday
characteristics
the
taste
starts
a
little
sweet
but
it
immediately
finishes
with
an
acidic
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
slight
moment
at
the
end
for
a
holiday
brew
there
really
isnt
anything
that
jumps
out
as
unique
but
it
is
entirely
drinkable
tastetoasted
malt
and
barley
faint
hop
note
throughout
easy
drinkability
with
a
little
higher
abv
than
traditional
stout
a
mild
ale
to
be
sure
but
with
generous
in
the
name
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
in
the
flavor
department
worth
a
try
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
pretty
brunette
with
a
very
nice
amber
colored
head
the
beer
had
good
lacing
the
head
was
big
bubbles
which
is
okay
i
like
fine
the
taste
was
goodness
as
expected
from
a
guinness
not
as
heavy
as
regular
guinness
but
more
taste
than
the
new
black
lager
i
will
buy
again
i
only
wish
it
wasnt
so
easy
drinking
because
i
have
so
few
of
them
taste
is
similar
roasty
and
flavorful
yet
light
in
body
theres
a
definite
tinge
of
bittering
hops
within
the
mix
but
the
roasty
malts
are
most
prevalent
this
is
a
rich
and
easydrinking
ale
not
great
but
certainly
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
guinness
fine
to
be
part
of
a
bathmarinade
for
some
chicken
or
pork
sold
as
a
component
of
a
guinness
sampler
pack
it
seemed
to
be
a
filler
for
the
very
good
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
bland
taste
aroma
and
no
body
the
color
was
a
very
muted
brown
it
looked
like
it
was
trying
to
be
a
dark
beer
but
just
couldnt
make
it
im
not
really
impressed
by
this
one
while
it
has
the
flavor
characteristics
of
a
dark
mild
the
abv
is
too
high
for
the
style
it
is
almost
like
a
highly
hopped
amber
lager
with
a
handful
of
roasted
barley
thrown
in
really
not
something
i
would
drink
again
real
good
beer
more
of
a
traditional
ale
not
a
hop
bomb
think
bass
ale
with
a
shot
of
guinness
poured
in
this
was
a
very
drinkable
smooth
beer
with
a
very
mild
flavor
and
the
aftertaste
of
guinness
i
only
wish
they
sold
it
separately
if
only
to
be
able
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
rather
than
only
getting
three
per
twelve
pack
i
look
to
see
it
next
year
in
its
own
package
i
wish
they
would
offer
this
in
a
four
pack
or
a
6
pack
i
dont
mind
getting
the
variety
pack
but
often
want
to
get
other
beers
too
overall
as
a
fan
of
guinness
im
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
having
it
again
the
roast
and
hop
bitterness
leaves
a
metallic
touch
that
does
eventually
fade
it
stops
just
short
of
clashing
with
the
malty
sweetness
i
dont
quite
understand
the
holiday
aspect
other
than
by
suggestion
and
perhaps
the
slightly
high
abv
for
the
brewery
anyway
its
decent
enough
it
comes
in
the
winter
variety
pack
which
is
worth
buying
for
the
foreign
extra
stout
and
to
try
this
one
out
seasonal
mixpack
from
guinness
with
a
new
beer
to
my
eyes
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
the
beer
was
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
it
pours
a
bright
vibrant
ambercopper
coloring
with
a
thin
clingy
filmy
white
ring
around
the
surface
aromas
of
old
world
fruit
both
subtle
and
darkly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
spicing
flavors
are
roasted
initially
with
a
significant
drop
off
of
body
and
flavors
after
the
forward
profiles
touches
of
toffee
and
caramel
blend
in
the
backbone
with
a
touch
of
tang
throughout
the
roasty
qualities
survive
throughout
and
well
into
the
aftertaste
which
intertwines
with
a
tangy
sweetness
for
a
decent
balance
that
is
missing
on
the
main
part
of
the
palate
the
beer
is
light
and
smooth
made
for
a
day
of
quaffing
sweet
linger
on
the
finish
with
a
slight
cloying
feel
as
the
last
of
the
flavor
leaves
your
tastebuds
interesting
brew
and
not
a
bad
addition
to
the
stateside
lineup
for
guinness
o
picked
up
the
winter
12
pack
to
give
this
a
shot
not
bad
but
not
worth
the
cost
however
the
pack
also
containes
3
bottle
of
forein
extra
which
is
really
really
good
overall
its
a
fairly
plain
but
easy
drinking
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
myself
but
its
a
good
pick
to
bring
to
something
like
a
family
party
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
buying
the
whole
12
pack
just
to
try
it
its
good
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
if
nothing
more
but
next
time
ill
probably
just
buy
the
classic
guinness
draught
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
a
few
times
great
for
early
morning
tailgate
or
sippin
while
workin
on
a
craft
at
home
will
add
taste
notes
soon
just
wanted
to
add
score
c
overall
i
will
admit
this
was
my
first
beer
from
the
brewery
and
my
first
english
dark
mild
as
well
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
so
i
cant
knock
the
beer
for
that
the
aroma
was
the
highlight
for
me
if
it
was
replicated
in
the
taste
i
would
love
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
eagle
rock
gotta
support
the
la
area
breweries
im
trying
all
of
these
low
alcohol
beers
which
seem
to
be
a
nice
experimental
trend
the
search
for
great
flavorful
beers
when
you
dont
have
time
to
sleep
it
off
eagle
rock
is
doing
a
good
job
with
the
less
powerful
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
on
tap
at
pizza
port
in
ocean
beach
the
beer
pours
an
inky
black
with
trace
tan
head
swirling
around
the
glass
circumference
the
nose
has
subtle
notes
of
roasted
coffee
beans
grains
and
bitter
cocoa
hops
dont
enter
the
picture
until
i
take
my
first
sip
which
resembles
a
mild
porter
with
a
grainy
roasty
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
definitely
a
malt
forward
mildmedium
bodied
beer
that
opens
up
more
as
the
beer
trends
towards
room
temperature
tasty
drinkable
fairly
priced
but
unfortunately
has
difficult
availability
id
drink
this
beer
again
but
would
let
it
warm
up
more
before
pouring
d
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
and
very
sessionable
nice
example
of
the
style
man
if
the
taste
was
half
as
good
as
the
smell
i
would
be
trading
for
more
that
said
i
feel
like
this
could
be
a
world
class
mild
with
a
small
tweak
would
have
again
im
not
nearly
as
into
the
co2
version
so
i
wont
review
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
pretty
hefty
for
such
a
light
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
i
havent
tried
any
other
english
dark
mild
ales
so
there
arent
any
comparisons
to
make
but
this
beer
has
really
grown
on
me
it
pours
a
dark
brown
and
has
a
small
amount
of
head
retention
with
decent
lacing
as
the
beer
is
consumed
you
are
greeted
with
a
nice
roasted
smell
with
notes
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
with
a
coffee
background
it
tends
to
go
away
quickly
not
a
lot
of
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
light
with
soft
carbonation
some
have
described
it
as
having
a
watereddown
tastefeel
which
is
what
i
thought
the
first
couple
times
i
had
it
however
since
then
i
really
have
noticed
and
begun
to
appreciate
the
malt
flavors
if
you
werent
impressed
with
it
the
first
time
i
say
give
it
another
chance
drink
this
was
strictly
a
style
tick
not
a
fan
of
the
style
its
far
too
watery
and
light
i
guess
the
profile
just
isnt
for
me
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
solid
12
inch
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
roasted
nuts
and
some
minor
coffee
flavors
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
after
each
sip
along
with
a
slightly
sour
quality
on
the
tongue
this
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
tap
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
mild
but
the
sour
aspect
got
to
bit
too
much
towards
the
end
of
the
pint
o
really
we
need
to
see
this
style
on
cask
and
we
need
to
see
more
of
it
a
solid
example
of
this
rare
at
least
in
the
us
style
overall
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
but
that
is
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
flavor
is
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
very
nice
session
drinker
t
day
old
coffee
grounds
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
toffee
with
a
slightly
watery
finish
mouthfeel
is
definitely
thin
and
a
bit
watery
o
this
is
a
good
session
stout
low
alcohol
very
drinkable
but
nothing
remarkable
here
o
i
would
have
preferred
this
not
be
on
nitrogen
but
not
much
i
can
do
about
that
do
this
beer
offers
some
attractive
features
in
a
truly
sessionable
package
the
smell
is
quite
assertive
and
appetizing
like
something
that
should
accompany
breakfast
the
nitro
propulsion
smooths
out
the
front
end
taste
and
feel
successfully
retooling
the
acidity
issues
this
beer
has
on
draft
while
underwhelming
the
flavors
remain
just
interesting
enough
to
keep
coming
back
forand
they
never
threaten
to
tax
the
palate
which
is
amenable
to
the
sub4
abv
in
some
respects
it
would
be
difficult
to
pick
this
out
of
a
lineup
of
dry
irish
stouts
although
anyone
with
a
decent
sense
of
smell
could
probably
figure
it
out
d
because
this
is
such
a
low
abv
beer
this
could
be
drunk
for
hour
and
hours
its
a
great
session
beer
id
go
back
for
more
of
this
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
like
seeing
a
dark
mild
being
brewed
i
really
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
cask
though
mild
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
light
body
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
real
easy
drinking
beer
could
drink
all
night
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
was
served
to
me
at
tonys
darts
away
in
burbank
and
was
poured
perfectly
very
dark
in
appearance
with
a
thick
tan
creamy
head
chocolate
and
coffee
smell
but
not
a
strong
taste
of
it
sweet
and
very
mild
going
down
no
bitterness
at
all
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
yum
solidarity
takes
a
different
path
from
another
local
mild
prohibition
mild
but
end
up
with
a
similar
amount
of
goodness
didnt
have
any
trouble
finishing
this
beer
but
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
poured
a
dark
black
color
into
pint
glass
light
roasty
smell
the
taste
of
a
roasted
porter
light
in
taste
nice
mouthfeel
not
strong
good
drinkability
light
enough
to
drink
all
night
this
was
the
third
beer
i
had
after
drinking
red
velvet
and
revolution
this
was
very
good
as
i
wasnt
expecting
the
roastiness
of
the
flavor
light
enough
to
drink
but
with
a
very
good
taste
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
solid
first
effort
from
a
new
brewery
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
while
tasty
this
comes
across
as
more
of
a
homebrew
as
it
is
a
touch
rough
around
the
edges
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
eagle
rock
comes
up
with
given
more
time
this
is
a
suprememly
drinkable
mild
hell
my
glass
emptied
itself
a
few
times
cant
wait
to
get
a
few
growlers
to
me
this
beer
is
underrated
great
brew
very
pleasant
and
an
excellent
lunch
beer
its
worth
a
pint
to
accompany
a
noonday
sandwich
o
the
mild
ale
revolution
is
seemingly
always
right
around
the
corner
and
if
there
were
more
like
this
and
two
bros
long
haul
readily
available
it
just
might
happen
its
tempting
just
to
session
this
but
there
are
so
many
other
interesting
handles
here
to
try
this
is
a
session
nice
beer
some
good
tones
but
they
are
lacking
some
depth
pours
dark
brown
with
a
onefinger
head
smell
is
coffee
caramel
clover
tea
biscuits
taste
is
slightly
tannic
some
toffee
notes
random
herbage
crisp
bitter
finish
its
moderately
carbonated
not
bad
for
a
growler
over
a
week
old
quite
thin
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
fine
beer
wish
some
local
brewer
would
make
an
equivalent
o
a
nice
session
beer
that
is
pretty
fulfilling
given
the
depth
of
flavor
at
3
5
easy
to
drink
and
worth
trying
been
lookin
for
a
nice
true
session
ale
lately
this
one
pours
a
lovely
clear
smokey
topazgarnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
oatmeal
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
toffee
grass
flowers
and
a
pinch
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
happily
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
bit
of
calcium
but
in
a
good
way
put
it
this
way
normally
a
taste
of
hard
water
does
not
help
the
beer
any
generally
its
a
detriment
but
it
seems
to
augment
things
here
the
body
is
a
sorta
heftyseeming
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
easydrinkin
brew
something
i
can
easily
see
myself
downing
over
a
nice
long
afternoon
at
the
brewpub
this
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
red
mahogany
color
clear
body
with
a
decent
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
aromatics
are
faint
in
nature
there
are
hints
of
some
mild
fruit
but
with
a
biscuit
backer
the
flavors
of
this
beer
have
some
caramel
notes
with
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
faint
red
apple
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
bitter
but
only
enough
for
you
to
know
that
there
were
hops
put
in
the
beer
other
than
that
it
drinks
fantastic
at
3
5
how
can
you
lose
with
something
this
tasty
it
definitely
makes
me
wanna
head
on
over
there
myself
growler
courtesy
of
dunt
on
ba
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
glass
a
dark
clear
brownish
color
with
the
slightest
tinge
of
red
starts
with
a
12
finger
head
of
tan
that
quickly
settles
out
to
form
a
collar
around
the
glass
the
nose
has
notes
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
all
pretty
subtle
some
slight
lace
left
on
the
glass
mediumlight
mouthfeel
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
light
notes
of
coffee
caramel
and
roast
not
as
flavorful
as
i
was
holing
for
but
a
nice
drinker
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
i
could
throw
back
several
pints
of
this
pretty
easily
pours
a
fairlydark
brown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
to
tan
head
with
moderate
retention
and
a
nice
cap
as
it
falls
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
dose
of
roasted
malt
also
there
is
a
bit
of
coffee
and
mild
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
robust
than
the
nose
with
all
components
being
a
bit
more
pronounced
some
mild
bitterness
along
with
the
roast
in
the
finish
light
body
and
really
nice
drinkability
certainly
a
powerful
session
beer
beer
is
thin
in
body
expected
but
not
dry
in
the
finish
it
has
a
roasty
bitterness
at
the
end
that
is
nice
because
it
does
not
approach
something
that
is
really
bitter
like
coffee
or
too
much
hops
there
is
a
mild
lead
off
of
sweetness
at
the
beginning
and
finishes
nicely
as
well
i
seriously
could
drink
this
all
day
long
d
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
nice
schwarztbier
qualities
with
good
roasted
characters
and
pretty
clean
with
no
real
yeast
characters
but
still
delicious
and
drinks
very
quickly
di
could
probably
go
on
drinking
this
one
all
night
insanely
drinkable
and
interesting
enough
that
i
want
to
keep
drinking
it
d
this
is
pretty
easy
drinkin
if
i
were
in
a
particularly
english
mood
i
could
probably
go
with
this
one
all
through
a
good
football
or
even
cricket
match
it
was
however
one
of
if
not
the
most
drinkable
craft
beers
ive
ever
had
lots
of
flavor
to
be
enjoyed
but
easy
going
down
and
at
only
3
5
abv
not
much
to
be
afraid
of
upon
leaving
this
is
what
i
want
to
see
more
of
from
american
brewers
simple
is
the
name
of
the
game
very
drinkable
a
really
solid
mild
ale
overall
great
session
beer
in
any
sense
of
the
term
drinkability
is
ok
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
d
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
perfect
drinkability
bold
malt
profile
with
great
balance
smooth
and
delicate
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
this
beer
challenged
my
thought
that
low
alcohol
beers
cant
have
robust
flavors
this
one
most
certainly
has
them
d
drinkable
as
they
come
thats
the
whole
point
of
the
style
sessionable
brew
mild
but
delicious
not
my
alltime
favorite
of
their
brews
but
still
a
damn
fine
one
that
i
enjoy
regularly
when
i
want
delicious
beer
but
not
tons
of
alcohol
if
i
have
to
summarize
this
brew
in
one
word
i
suppose
it
would
be
complex
its
a
very
smoky
beer
with
an
excellent
mix
of
malts
i
found
the
scent
a
bit
underwhelming
relative
to
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
but
this
didnt
negatively
influence
my
review
i
noticed
that
another
reviewer
mentioned
some
fruitness
i
didnt
notice
this
myself
but
perhaps
ill
detect
it
next
time
youll
also
recall
that
my
pour
didnt
seem
to
have
as
much
head
as
was
mentioned
by
the
previous
reviewers
this
is
an
excellent
beer
which
you
must
try
at
least
once
excellent
mild
ale
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
very
thin
body
but
hits
the
mark
for
the
style
huge
foamy
head
from
the
cask
that
settles
and
sticks
to
the
glass
has
a
deep
brown
color
that
youd
expect
from
a
decent
brown
alemild
ale
i
will
drink
this
again
and
again
and
again
edit
make
sure
you
get
a
full
pint
the
2nd
time
i
had
this
it
was
short
poured
with
3
of
foam
one
of
the
best
cask
beers
ive
had
this
style
obviously
really
works
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
is
enjoyable
and
as
a
result
of
the
low
abv
definitely
a
session
beer
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
there
are
just
not
too
many
options
in
it
especially
made
in
the
us
glad
i
found
this
one
since
i
started
doing
full
reviews
i
previously
had
it
at
a
cask
festival
in
late
2011
overall
a
very
interesting
panoply
of
flavor
nice
to
see
more
breweries
experimenting
with
the
style
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
with
the
added
smokiness
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
to
session
with
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
milder
smoky
beer
o
this
was
my
1st
dark
mild
and
i
quite
enjoyed
it
but
not
as
much
as
the
company
i
was
with
overall
a
very
tasty
mild
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
a
small
package
overall
an
enjoyable
mild
slightly
watery
tasting
but
otherwise
a
good
beer
overall
pretty
good
drinkable
and
tasty
nice
malt
profile
hint
of
hops
despite
being
light
it
has
a
nice
dark
malt
presence
nicely
done
o
overall
i
really
like
this
dark
mild
nice
appearance
and
good
roasty
flavors
really
really
enjoy
this
and
would
like
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
it
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
rather
sessionable
especially
given
its
low
alcohol
content
justify
rating
with
a
review
i
didnt
like
it
very
much
if
i
lowered
my
rating
to
closer
to
the
current
average
what
contribution
have
i
made
this
is
simply
awful
i
honestly
dont
know
why
they
produce
this
beer
it
is
bitter
poor
flavor
and
just
overall
terrible
this
one
is
definitely
interesting
unique
and
pretty
light
and
refreshing
bottle
poured
a
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
super
large
dirty
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
some
oak
notes
and
funky
ester
is
a
weird
mix
that
i
wasnt
expecting
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
tart
notes
with
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
with
dry
funky
yeast
notes
body
is
light
with
perfect
carbonation
glad
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
but
not
sure
it
is
something
i
would
seek
on
a
regular
basis
overall
its
not
something
id
want
to
try
again
o
perhaps
i
miss
the
point
and
maybe
i
just
landed
a
bad
bottle
but
the
beer
i
got
offers
very
little
of
interest
the
flavors
hit
none
of
the
points
i
recognize
and
value
in
my
beer
drinking
the
sour
elements
were
perhaps
the
only
real
interest
and
they
were
quite
muted
out
front
was
wood
but
a
little
oak
goes
a
long
way
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
but
it
was
a
disappointment
jester
kings
commitment
to
the
farmhouse
yeast
is
commendable
even
if
some
of
their
attempts
at
mixing
styles
dont
quite
work
this
one
is
an
interesting
mix
with
some
cool
flavor
but
it
isnt
the
best
ive
had
from
jk
very
sessionable
but
why
there
is
nothing
to
recommend
the
flavor
except
perhaps
to
an
oak
leaf
roller
what
jk
is
doing
is
commendable
but
this
offering
does
not
make
it
for
my
taste
o
interesting
and
tasty
beer
flavors
were
subtle
but
enjoyable
and
beer
is
endlessly
drinkable
i
ended
up
knocking
a
few
points
off
on
it
due
to
the
flavors
starting
to
wear
on
me
as
the
bear
warmed
but
other
than
that
enjoyable
and
very
different
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
has
been
infected
or
if
its
supposed
to
taste
like
this
but
i
dont
like
the
slight
cherry
flavor
in
it
itd
be
good

just

a

to
show
everyone
how
farmhouse
is
supposed
to
taste

with
flavor
and
character
especially
given
the
modest

abv
the
oak
isnt
subtle
by
any
means
and
dominates
the
beer
its
not
a
bad
thing
but
it
seems
to
make
this
offering
a
bit
one
dimensional
a
tasty
and
interesting
interruption
of
the
session
beer
genre
though
im
not
sure
its
something
i
would
revisit
with
regularity
b
it
doesnt
work
for
me
tastes
and
feels
lagerlike
with
the
exception
of
the
carbonation
nothing
jumps
at
me
overall
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
extremely
light
body
and
while
the
flavors
are
all
fairly
light
it
has
a
pretty
complex
flavor
profile
plenty
of
woodiness
and
nuttiness
along
with
some
mild
funk
interesting
but
not
quite
to
my
tastes
the
tobaccowoody
elements
were
not
altogether
pleasant
for
me
not
bad
though

d
its
okay
but
its
boring
even
for
a
session
beer
overall
jester
king
has
a
knack
for
it
and
while
this
one
isnt
perfect
it
is
still
a
good
brew
milds
are
best
enjoyed
fresh
off
the
tap
if
im
ever
in
the
area
ill
have
to
stop
by
and
try
it
again
o
interesting
but
not
really
worth
a
second
try
imo
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
tuliplike
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
light
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
bready
and
caramel
malt
chocolate
oak
dark
fruit
cherries
and
some
spice
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
nuts
vanilla
and
dark
bread
also
the
chocolate
is
stronger
in
the
taste
than
it
is
compared
to
the
aroma
i
thought
the
taste
of
this
brew
got
better
the
longer
it
warmed
up
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
easy
to
drink
and
is
well
carbonated
this
is
the
2nd
jester
king
brew
ive
tried
and
ive
liked
them
both
so
far
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
7

a
bottle
this
is
a
weird
beer
but
i
like
it
the
oak
is
very
interesting
and
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
beer
especially
considering
how
mild
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
not
the
most
interesting
beer
out
there
but
its
novel
and
tasty
for
what
it
is
light
and
easy
drinking
but
carries
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
sipping
a
good
if
not
great
bottle
o
lots
going
on
here
for
a
3
5
beer
really
nice
one
taste
is
woody
and
winey
and
a
bit
of
smoke
and
some
strange
phenols
from
the
yeast
but
its
not
off
putting
in
any
way
a
little
thin
but
that
was
to
be
expected
nice
session
beer
that
im
glad
i
bought
leaves
you
thinking
but
gives
you
room
to
move
around
and
drink
the
whole
bottle
valient
effort
dont
understand
the
low
scores
poured
out
as
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
retention
is
and
lacing
on
this
beer
were
impressive
and
long
lasting
the
smell
gives
off
earthy
toasted
malt
aromas
as
well
as
some
subtle
oak
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
malty
and
dry
slightly
bitter
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
good
level
of
carbonation
but
very
dry
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
overall
meh
nothing
really
special
i
like
that
they
tried
something
new
but
this
doesnt
go
far
malts
are
meh
hops
are
even
more
meh
yeast
could
be
nice
if
it
brought
more
flavor
other
than
the
yeasty
flavor
and
oak
just
overpowers
everything
to
the
point
where
all
you
really
get
is
oak
and
light
sour
candy
malts
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
roasted
nut
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
nutty
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
served
from
bottle
into
a
hill
farmstead
oversized
wine
glass
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bread
fruit
wood
and
subtle
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
fruit
spice
dark
chocolate
and
subtle
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
apretty
decent
brew
i
went
into
this
one
truthfully
expecting
to
find
something
awesome
in
this
one
what
i
found
however
didnt
really
jump
out
at
me
like
i
would
have
hoped
there
was
a
nice
bit
of
things
going
on
in
this
one
which
was
nice
to
find
really
wish
there
would
have
been
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
going
on
in
this
one
to
balance
it
out
some
but
hey
you
cant
win
them
all
definitely
worth
your
time
if
you
get
the
chance
d
nice
oaked
mild
great
overall
balance
with
a
different
mix
of
flavors
o
a
great
cross
between
an
english
ale
a
farmhouse
ale
o
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
particularly
special
not
undrinkable
but
not
awful
either
o
this
is
a
nice
english
mild
all
of
the
right
aromas
and
flavors
are
there
and
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
a
sessionable
mild
i
dont
really
get
the
low
score
here
does
it
have
as
much
flavor
as
a
dipa
or
sour
or
pack
as
much
of
a
punch
as
a
barleywine
or
ris
of
course
not
is
it
supposed
to
absolutely
not
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
mild
its
in
the
name
after
all
and
to
be
drunk
in
large
quantities
without
putting
you
on
your
ass
this
beer
fulfills
both
of
those
requirements
and
is
tasty
at
that
nice
beer
from
jester
king
o
overall
i
am
glad
that
i
picked
this
up
it
is
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
again
but
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
another
beer
from
jester
king
i
never
know
what
to
expect
when
i
pop
open
one
of
their
beers
and
that
always
has
me
excited
after
a
very
surprising
beer
in
ru55
i
follow
it
up
with
this
i
remember
loving
this
beer
when
it
was
not
farmhouse
the
original
version
was
great
especially
on
cask
this
is
a
thin
unappealing
beer
that
has
no
business
in
the
english
mild
or
farmhouse
styles
a
complete
mess
deep
amber
in
color
finger
of
head
with
nice
retention
smells
of
funky
yeast
chocolate
raisins
oak
the
flavor
is
nutty
with
hints
of
oak
vanilla
a
very
mild
tasting
ale
high
carbonation
light
in
body
slightly
tart
excellent
sessionable
ale
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
very
flavorful
o
its
a
replacement
for
water
not
suggesting
this
is
anything
close
to
bmc
most
likely
wont
ever
purchase
again
8
smoked
water
na
d
the
base
beer
seems
like
a
great
mild
but
the
oak
becomes
overpowering
as
it
warms
oddly
compelling
in
taste
and
texture
the
beer
leaves
much
left
to
be
wanted
in
a
single
drinking
session
but
paired
with
herbinfused
sausages
and
a
slight
marmalade
glaze
would
set
the
ale
off
nicely
it
just
begs
for
the
dinner
table
o
this
is
a
delishious
session
it
really
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
im
glad
we
occasionally
get
jester
king
brews
brought
to
us
im
going
to
vote
for
this
to
be
in
6
packs
in
the
future
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
jks
regular
line
up
so
far
it
packs
in
a
lot
of
complexity
for
a
lowabv
beer
given
its
price
it
makes
for
an
excellent
semiregular
treat
throughout
the
year
highly
sessionable
but
with
so
much
complexity
makes
this
beer
drinkable
yearround
and
any
day
of
the
week
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pinttulip
glass
oaked
farmhouse
version
no
bottle
date
this
pours
a
dark
brown
mahoganyish
color
with
a
three
finger
tan
head
which
quickly
loses
half
its
size
then
remains
as
a
a
thin
film
the
smells
are
of
a
very
strong
malty
type
a
little
nuttiness
caramel
a
little
oak
but
not
as
prominent
as
the
others
the
feel
is
surprising
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
mid
to
thick
the
taste
is
pretty
good
full
flavored
for
a
3
5
abv
beer
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
a
little
nutty
flavor
loads
of
malts
caramel
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
first
sour
i
ever
had
was
a
sour
version
of
this
beer
i
loved
it
and
i
like
this
version
almost
as
much
great
beer
i
typically
dont
love
non
sour
jester
king
beers
but
this
one
is
great
i
would
certainly
buy
more
especially
at
this
price
point
very
drinkable
m
its
light
leading
to
medium
heavily
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
i
love
seeing
beers
that
show
how
flavor
can
be
imparted
wout
increasing
the
abv
tenfold
thanks
brad
o
the
skill
that
reveals
itself
in
pretty
much
every
aspect
of
enjoying
this
beer
proves
that
jeff
stuffings
is
a
master
of
the
craft
an
artist
delving
into
new
grounds
although
milds
are
not
my
favorite
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
recipe
would
rank
at
the
top
of
those
seeking
such
a
sessionable
beer
bravo
o
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sierra
nevada
tumbler
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
makes
for
a
perfect
low
alcohol
beer
for
the
winter
light
bodied
completely
to
style
in
this
case
with
plenty
of
lasting
oak
flavors
subtlety
is
the
name
of
the
game
dry
and
woody
flavorful
with
some
flashes
of
green
hop
traces
but
minimal
bitterness
very
smooth
and
refined
a
very
unique
rendition
of
a
mild
ale
and
something
i
wish
was
on
cask
locally
hope
someone
out
there
can
pull
strings
to
make
it
happen
this
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
with
thin
bubbles
and
an
apparent
low
carbonation
great
aroma
very
tart
and
bold
with
an
obvious
comparison
to
balsamic
vinegar
that
doesnt
do
it
justice
tastes
mouthpuckeringly
tart
like
sour
cherries
or
blackberries
and
just
incredibly
so
more
tartness
than
a
hoppy
bitterness
which
is
in
its
own
way
refreshing
the
souring
process
brought
something
to
this
beer
which
made
it
distinctive
and
in
a
class
all
its
own
this
is
wonderful
i
loved
every
sip
and
wish
i
could
have
had
more
this
is
a
great
session
type
beer
that
went
very
well
with
pizza
tastes
similarly
roasty
with
a
touch
of
burnt
chocolate
very
tasty
full
flavored
and
sessionable
top
ill
definitely
return
for
another
my
expectations
were
met
with
a
good
drinkable
brew
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
quite
nicely
lovely
dark
appearance
under
a
small
light
tan
head
smell
is
mild
malt
and
mild
hops
and
the
taste
follows
the
smell
precisely
fine
light
chocolate
maltiness
and
a
decent
breaddough
flavor
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
round
and
is
the
best
feature
of
this
madeforasession
beer
very
drinkable
d
this
should
be
more
available
as
a
style
session
worthy
flavorful
and
intense
in
the
way
that
rest
notes
accentuate
the
solos
in
jazz
i
have
loved
this
style
for
a
while
and
nabc
has
this
one
nailed
it
makes
me
want
to
brew
a
mild
even
more
when
i
taste
one
as
well
mades
as
this
it
has
custard
smoothness
and
truffle
like
depth
that
lingers
just
top
notch
great
on
draft
if
youre
planning
on
having
a
few
pretty
low
alcohol
great
body
with
good
flavor
another
pleasure
to
drink
reminescent
of
a
german
schwatzbier
the
bready
and
yeasty
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
expected
along
with
moderate
barley
malt
sweetness
throw
in
a
mild
black
malt
flavor
without
any
graininess
light
molassas
and
walnut
flavors
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
texture
is
light
and
airy
to
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
light
black
malt
bitterness
never
chalky
or
charcoallike
but
with
other
albanian
brews
the
carbonation
is
very
low
and
has
a
disapointing
foamstand
and
lacing
otherwise
a
joy
taste
smooooth
light
on
the
palate
very
easy
yet
full
of
character
if
not
too
full
of
body
loads
of
malt
lots
of
taste
much
more
full
of
taste
than
id
expect
from
an
english
mild
i
like
it
its
good
a
much
ballsier
mild
than
id
been
anticipating
very
worthy
very
good
nice
hooray
new
albany
and
all
the
new
albanians
special
thanks
to
mike
to
buying
a
keg
for
rich
os
patrons
and
then
giving
it
away
for
free
muddy
brown
color
with
a
thin
but
creamy
head
chocolate
espresso
almonds
and
a
subtle
hop
presence
in
the
nose
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
consitent
undercurrent
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
this
beer
goes
one
step
further
however
opening
up
with
some
nutty
malt
toffee
and
moderate
hop
flavor
delicious
really
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
smooth
and
only
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
is
outstanding
as
this
ale
abounds
with
delicious
flavor
and
low
alcohol
its
hard
to
drink
just
a
pint
of
this
stuff
another
please
growler
fill
calf
killer
can
do
no
wrong
o
this
should
have
been
gulpable
but
i
struggled
through
my
pint
a
bit
others
on
here
seem
to
have
liked
it
better
than
me
i
guess
i
should
try
it
again
someday
overall
another
great
example
of
why
calfkiller
is
my
new
favorite
brewery
cant
seem
to
get
enough
from
these
guys
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bearden
beer
garden
in
knoxville
tn
pours
very
murky
and
almost
a
purplish
brown
color
i
am
not
sure
what
style
this
is
supposed
to
be
but
it
seems
like
a
mix
of
several
there
was
a
definite
belgian
character
to
this
whether
it
was
the
yeast
or
maybe
some
candi
sugar
or
something
tasted
pretty
good
overall
aroma
were
slightly
sweet
and
belgian
like
with
some
cloviness
flavors
were
pretty
tight
as
well
a
definite
change
of
pace
and
a
decent
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
calfkillers
so
far
easygoing
and
very
sessionable
without
a
doubt
these
guys
are
the
best
upandcoming
brewery
in
midtn
their
best
brews
seem
to
have
that
chewy
creamy
nougaty
malt
up
front
while
closing
dry
and
crisp
with
a
very
branflakydry
maltiness
bars
serving
calfkiller
now
define
where
i
drink
in
nashville
it
is
highly
drinkable
a
very
good
session
beer
o
anchor
does
it
again
tough
style
for
people
to
get
behind
but
this
drinks
extremely
well
i
wish
more
local
breweries
made
beers
like
this
overall
now
drink
up
and
enjoy
by
that
i
mean
i
will
drink
up
and
enjoy
sorta
seemed
like
a
brekles
lite
this
pours
a
light
amber
tan
with
nice
foaming
theres
a
light
malt
aroma
atop
lots
of
caramel
malt
tastes
sweet
and
malty
nicely
smooth
and
it
can
stand
up
to
warming
mild
easygoing
but
not
terribly
exciting
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
dont
get
what
all
the
praise
for
this
one
in
the
region
not
on
ba
is
about
i
wound
up
exteremly
underwhelmed
with
the
zymaster
mild
ive
had
several
milds
up
to
now
and
this
is
easily
the
worst
that
ive
had
thats
something
that
i
thought
i
would
never
write
about
an
anchor
product
but
this
was
not
for
me
i
would
happily
drink
another
at
this
moment
a
good
way
to
start
the
night
this
beer
was
nice
and
smooth
i
would
have
it
again
my
slight
cold
may
have
hurt
or
helped
this
rating
as
well
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
dark

to

on

of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass

the
drink
down

is
of
malt
grain

some
slight

taste
is
of

and
grain
and
some
slight

flavors
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
fine
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
well
executed
smooth
and
clean
with
a
lot
of
flavor
beer
is
almost
holiday
spicy
in
a
way
light
in
body
sweet
burned
sugar
nice
caramel
sweetness
overall
a
nice
beer
but
it
falls
a
little
flat
the
finish
is
mildly
unpleasant
with
a
roasty
grainness
that
makes
me
not
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
low
in
alcohol
at
least
but
not
a
repeat
one
of
the
first
beers
they
had
here
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
a
unique
combination
of
styles
that
works
well
well
crafted
and
interesting
poured
from
tap
into
pint
at
1702
tucson
pours
a
deep
brown
amber
with
nice
creamy
bead
not
much
aroma
here
some
slight
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hop
with
a
bit
of
roastedness
taste
is
really
nice
almost
coffee
roasted
malts
and
sweet
malts
nicely
balanced
with
some
hop
bitterness
really
smooth
and
definitely
a
session
brew
nice
job
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
especially
for
being
this
far
from
england
and
in
the
desert
ive
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
someone
to
brew
a
dark
mild
around
here
and
while
its
not
quite
the
ideal
strength
around
3
abv
i
think
itll
do
just
fine
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
as
well
as
anything
else
this
fine
new
brewery
has
to
offer
the
chewy
texture
ample
malt
flavor
balance
between
dark
malt
and
sweetness
and
quaffability
make
this
a
great
beer
for
pairing
with
food
i
could
wish
for
something
closer
to
4
in
strength
in
fact
i
always
prefer
my
own
milds
to
be
under
4
but
i
could
see
the
low
alcohol
perhaps
being
a
harder
sell
for
your
typical
craft
beer
drinker
in
truth
though
i
am
really
quite
enjoying
this
beer
i
wont
mind
in
the
least
that
i
have
a
couple
pints
of
this
i
really
wish
this
style
of
beer
was
a
lot
easier
to
get
i
really
hope
this
does
well
here
in
tucson
it
would
be
nice
to
have
this
as
an
easy
option
when
going
out
to
dinner
around
town
i
will
always
have
soft
spot
for
milds
as
they
were
one
of
those
styles
that
i
had
to
brew
myself
in
order
to
actually
try
the
style
for
the
first
time
eh
not
too
great
here
d
hi
mark
for
drinkablity
could
guzzle
these
by
the
dozen
and
still
get
no
buzz
im
sure
american
craft
brewers
embrace
this
style
as
you
have
porter
this
could
be
a
great
gateway
into
cask
ale
for
americans
brewers
it
also
could
be
a
great
american
craft
keg
beer
some
experimentation
is
required
on
another
note
lets
hope
the
cains
brewery
of
liverpool
survives
and
grows
an
awful
lot
of
cases
of
canned
dark
mild
straight
from
merry
ol
right
on
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
walnuts
light
rye
bread
toffee
and
a
hint
of
tea
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
slight
bit
of
blunt
fruit
in
the
background
possibly
the
byproduct
of
some
tea
or
coffee
acridness
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
mild
if
nothing
all
that
outstanding
for
the
style
i
could
see
drinking
plenty
of
this
though
the
price
may
have
me
questioning
that
plan
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
better
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
before
this
one
overall
not
bad
it
is
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
more
like
a
light
milk
stout
or
creamy
brown
than
a
mild
at
least
what
ive
seen
but
im
not
very
familiar
with
the
history
of
british
milds
it
really
seems
to
have
nitro
carbonation
which
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
for
me
for
most
beers
esp
something
like
a
mild
where
it
seems
to
overpower
many
of
the
other
flavors
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
4
0
d
pretty
good
beer
to
reach
for
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
session
beer
no
real
complaints
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
carbonation
levels
of
medium
intensity
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
at
first
quickly
setting
to
a
smooth
softly
flowing
and
slightly
foamy
sensation
closes
semidry
with
small
amounts
of
lingering
stickiness
on
the
palate
up
to
now
i
have
only
rated
the
beers
i
have
tried
with
this
one
i
had
to
review
it
i
was
pretty
stunned
by
this
beer
the
color
is
this
deep
dark
blackish
mahogany
its
gorgeous
the
head
out
of
the
can
was
impressive
the
color
of
coffee
foam
and
initially
almost
a
full
third
of
my
glass
the
flavor
is
all
at
once
chocolate
and
coffee
with
no
trace
of
bitterness
it
made
me
think
of
mocha
ice
cream
without
the
sugar
the
mouth
feel
was
very
wet
almost
no
aftertaste
like
a
boddingtons
kind
of
at
3
2
abv
its
really
low
on
the
scale
i
would
say
if
you
like
malty
beers
this
one
is
worth
a
try
overall
i
could
probably
drink
gallons
of
this
stuff
big
flavor
in
a
lightabv
brew
always
wins
high
marks
from
me
i
want
to
get
these
for
a
sunny
afternoon
when
it
is
nice
to
be
outside
it
only
hit
37
degrees
today
still
frigid
even
in
the
sun
then
they
can
transport
and
refresh
you
with
liverpools
coolness
o
a
nice
beer
from
a
can
or
not
the
argument
for
this
being
a
simple
style
is
wellfounded
but
the
subtleties
here
are
very
pleasing
and
the
low
abv
is
perfectly
sessionable
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
always
appreciate
a
style
that
isnt
as
accessible
or
popular
out
here
in
the
western
us
and
would
drink
it
again
super
drinkable
mild
brew
that
has
an
almost
laughably
low
abv
for
us
mericans
used
to
at
least
5
even
in
our
light
pisswater
lagers
could
have
one
or
two
with
lunch
on
a
weekend
and
not
ruin
your
afternoon
malty
tasty
and
mellow
this
is
a
really
nice
session
brew
this
is
a
definite
entry
in
the
highflavor
lowalcohol
sweepstakes
from
the
16
oz
can
bought
in
abilene
texas
overall
a
very
very
impressive
beer
for
only
being
3
2
tons
more
flavor
than
any
light
beer
on
the
market
this
is
a
beer
you
could
literally
sip
on
all
day
oh
how
i
wish
we
could
get
more
beers
like
this
in
the
states
i
would
buy
case
loads
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
almost
watery
in
feel
it
is
otherwise
smooth
and
very
sessionable
the
beer
pours
a
rich
dark
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
tan
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
with
hints
of
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
coffee
taste
first
and
foremost
but
adds
on
that
with
the
undertones
of
toasted
malt
and
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
smooth
and
wet
to
start
but
then
drys
in
the
finish
overall
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
a
beer
one
could
sip
on
all
evening
nice
malty
coffee
aroma
deep
black
color
thick
foamy
head
that
lingers
to
the
last
sip
extremely
mild
yet
excellent
flavor
of
roasted
malt
pity
that
u
s
brewers
cannot
brew
a
low
abv
dark
beer
with
this
much
flavor
440
ml

pours
crystal
clear
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
slight
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
molasses
toffee
biscuit
toast
milk
chocolate
nuttiness
earth
and
light
herbal

very
nice
and
pleasant

good

earth
light

earth
and
herbal
on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
some
decent
flavor
balance
with
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
overall
no
cloying
flavors
at
all
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
good
no
alcohol
noticed
other
than
a
minimal
warming
after
the
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
as
expected
overall
this
is
a
nice
mild
nice
fairly
robust
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
i
hope
to
find
more
milds
in
the
future
there
really
arent
too
many
available
in
the
states
an
alright
take
on
the
style
this
would
be
better
on
cask
im
sure
drinks
pretty
easy
not
too
bad
for
such
a
low
abv
offering
some
times
they
travel
very
poorly
overall
sure
its
a
mild
but
compared
to
others
this
isnt
really
memorable
at
all
overall
a
decent
take
on
the
style
some
nice
flavors
and
very
light
kind
of
like
a
guinness
draught
not
bad
for
a
3
2
brew
this
should
be
in
minnesota
gas
stations
as
a
alternate
to
3
2
bmc
o
this
is
okay
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
a
little
too
pricey
at
11
99
a
six
pack
maybe
i
just
dont
like
or
understand
this
style
but
its
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
i
cant
recommend
it
on
any
level
the
dry
bitterness
hits
me
first
then
the
surprise
at
the
thin
mouthfeel
considering
that
thinness
theres
great
flavour
in
this
and
since
im
reviewing
a
british
beer
my
spelling
of
flavour
is
finally
appropriate
har
har
theres
lots
of
chocolate
flavour
and
dark
malty
flavour
and
the
bitterness
adds
to
it
nicely
not
overpowering
at
all
the
thinness
makes
it
both
flavourful
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
its
a
very
interesting
approach
to
a
dark
beer
i
see
why
its
called
mild
really
good
stuff
its
much
less
boring
than
i
expected
from
the
looks
of
the
can
i
imagine
this
stuff
is
pretty
cheap
in
england
which
is
a
shame
i
wish
i
could
buy
it
more
regularly
here
but
its
a
bit
pricey
for
such
a
mild
ale
still
well
worth
a
try
dont
be
put
off
by
it
being
mild
or
the
thinness
itll
surprise
you
ive
had
other
regional
3
2
beers
in
england
and
a
lot
of
them
are
low
in
carbonation
and
taste
watery
or
just
too
lacking
in
flavour
to
make
up
for
that
low
alcohol
content
but
this
one
is
spot
on
drinkability
though
light
and
on
the
weak
side
it
is
tasty
and
very
drinkable
i
am
definitely
eager
to
have
another
extremely
easy
to
drink
too
bad
american
breweries
do
not
do
beers
like
this
do
very
drinkable
with
the
low
abv
but
overall
somewhat
of
a
boring
beer
i
cannot
claim
to
be
an
expert
on
the
style
but
i
am
fairly
confident
that
there
are
better
options
out
there
2
5
overall
seems
most
suitable
as
a
thirst
quencher
or
accompaniment
to
a
meal
good
beer
to
give
newbies
who
think
dark
beers
are
too
strong
pours
almost
black
with
ruddy
tints
when
held
to
the
light
head
is
high
and
tan
not
much
lacing
smell
is
marigold
cut
wood
something
earthy
some
winelike
notes
taste
is
sweet
malt
up
front
a
crisp
vegetal
note
in
the
middle
with
tangy
rye
bread
at
the
finish
there
are
faint
notes
of
dried
fruit
as
well
its
a
thin
beer
moderately
carbonated
goes
down
easy
all
in
all
a
fine
beer
one
id
buy
often
if
it
were
available
cains
mild
dark
certainly
delivers
on
the
promise
of
full
flavor
with
superior
ease
of
consumption
in
fact
the
16oz
glass
met
my
mouth
only
four
times
before
the
beer
had
been
drank
it
would
take
no
time
to
vacate
a
few
of
these
from
the
sixpack
smooth
light
feel
low
carbonation
appropriate
for
the
style
lightly
toasted
grains
tobacco
vague
molasses
very
light
and
nuanced
but
thats
what
the
style
is
all
about
subtlety
very
easy
to
drink
sessionable
even
sad
if
the
rumors
are
true
that
this
will
disappear
from
the
states
very
soon
there
arent
many
readily
available
milds
out
there
pours
a
light
brown
color
creamy
khaki
colored
head
forms
with
excellent
retention
and
lace
mild
vaguely
malty
aroma
of
bread
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
flavor
mild
cocoa
like
flavor
from
the
malt
as
well
as
nutty
roasted
undertones
there
is
a
mild
toffee
like
flavor
and
a
small
tea
like
hopping
the
mouthfeel
of
cains
dark
mild
is
excellent
creamy
medium
carbonation
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
overall
a
fine
session
or
lunch
time
beer
low
alcohol
but
solid
flavor
and
great
feel
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
foam
that
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
fain
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
is
considerably
lighter
than
the
aroma
it
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
character
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
when
in
the
mood
for
something
light
light
bodied
fairly
light
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
and
so
drinkable
i
need
more
beers
that
resemble
this
one
low
carbonation
but
still
retains
a
bit
of
life
on
the
tongue
thinbodied
but
stops
short
of
being
watery
nice
as
a
change
up
to
a
steady
diet
of
boldly
flavored
high
abv
american
beers
however
theres
nothing
particularly
exciting
or
interesting
about
this
one
and
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
rather
have
a
tetleys
i
think
if
im
going
this
route
pretty
boring
beer
but
at
the
low
alcohol
level
its
fairly
remarkable
that
it
has
as
much
flavor
as
it
does
o
i
may
well
bring
this
beer
around
to
parties
its
not
great
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
not
flavorless
though
it
could
do
better
in
this
department
wont
kill
me
over
the
night
it
scratches
the
session
itch
though
mostly
for
lack
of
competition
in
the
canned
real
session
beer
category
i
think
a
didnt
really
judge
this
according
to
style
to
point
people
who
crave
only
huge
beers
or
those
who
dont
appreciate
nuance
though
to
be
clear
this
beer
is
not
weak
or
bland
will
hate
this
i
love
it
overall
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
being
a
mild
i
really
enjoy
is
and
reccomend
it
often
a
good
session
beer
overall
i
think
it
could
use
some
more
carbonation
but
when
it
comes
to
low
alcohol
beers
with
some
flavor
this
hits
the
mark
o
a
decent
little
beer
and
a
true
sessionable
one
at
that
overall
i
could
probably
drink
a
whole
keg
of
this
stuff
its
so
drinkable
very
thin
mouthfeel
which
i
wasnt
expecting
i
like
it
id
buy
it
again
ill
seek
out
more
milds
and
hope
to
produce
something
similar
myself
someday
not
a
bad
beer
not
an
exceptional
beer
just
beer
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
probably
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
you
wanted
to
drink
for
a
while
without
getting
buzzed
omight
make
a
nice
summer
drink
when
you
are
after
stout
flavors
without
the
heaviness
a
big
shout
out
to
woodychandler
for
providing
this
beer
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
can
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
nuts
somewhat
mild
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
this
one
was
interesting
to
try
not
my
cup
of
well
you
know
immediately
following
the
crack
there
was
an
offgassing
of
co2
that
looked
like
steam
rising
from
a
witchs
cauldron
i
am
doing
the
tragedy
of
macbeth
with
my
students
for
my
seventh
cansecutive
year
and
alan
eames
last
published
article
in
which
he
hypothesized
that
witches
were
simply
misunderstood
brewsters
cantinues
to
resonate
i
show
a
short
video
on
how
to
homebrew
and
one
of
these
days
i
am
going
to
lead
a
field
trip
to
a
local
brewpub
but
i
digress
the
glug
was
magnificent
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
resulting
in
not
only
a
cascading
action
but
also
a
dense
thick
two
fingers
of
mochatan
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
garnet
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
roasty
chocolaty
even
a
little
smoky
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
not
quite
creamy
but
still
very
big
on
the
tongue
the
taste
was
of
chocolate
and
coffee
initially
with
the
smokiness
arriving
and
lingering
on
and
after
the
finish
omfg
this
was
simply
marvy
darlings
the
dear
departed
ding
would
have
loved
this
session
beer
and
so
do
i
and
the
lacing
i
may
need
a
jackhammer
to
get
it
off
later
how
can
i
get
some
more
i
need
a
reserve
for
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
feb
annually
plus
some
for
the
beach
hiking
the
mountains
on
the
river
blah
blah
blah
arrived
in
a
pint
pub
glass
and
looked
much
like
a
very
dark
coke
with
a
slight
foam
head
lots
of
bubbles
visible
in
the
dark
brown
liquid
initial
smoke
in
the
nose
very
subtle
but
there
definitely
a
hint
of
the
smoky
roasted
malt
in
the
first
taste
with
a
spritz
on
the
tongue
and
a
very
mild
sorry
to
use
that
word
flavor
that
reminded
me
of
a
light
albeit
dark
beer
very
drinkable
and
at
3
2
abv
hardly
noticeable
as
an
alcoholic
beverage
but
enjoyed
it
very
thin
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
very
very
dry
finish
that
almost
made
your
mouth
feel
dry
perhaps
that
was
deliberate
makes
you
drink
more
nothing
id
order
again
but
i
enjoyed
it
you
could
put
down
a
bunch
of
them
with
a
meal
and
never
have
any
problems
walking
out
the
door
overall
long
thirsty
pulls
during
the
review
easy
drinking
and
great
flavor
great
beer
outstanding
session
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
low
alcohol
nice
pours
a
really
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
smallish
off
white
head
cant
be
coaxed
into
any
sort
of
retention
smells
lightly
of
chocolate
butterscotch
and
caramel
with
an
earthy
almost
mineraly
aroma
as
well
taste
is
earthy
butterscotch
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
slight
earthy
hop
breaks
through
the
sweetness
but
just
barely
light
body
and
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
could
certainly
drink
many
of
these
without
hesitation
it
was
a
bit
malty
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
presence
personally
o
owing
to
the
rarity
of
mild
as
a
style
it
is
hard
for
me
to
determine
just
how
closely
this
ale
adheres
to
the
traditional
guidelines
for
the
style
that
being
said
it
is
extremely
smooth
and
refreshing
handily
beating
out
the
likes
of
boddingtons
pub
ale
and
tetleys
english
ale
in
terms
of
depth
and
flavor
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
cask
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
true
session
beers
under
4
this
certainly
fits
the
bill
but
it
is
just
ho
hum
the
major
problem
is
i
have
not
tried
it
on
cask
very
neutral
on
tap
hopefully
one
day
i
can
try
it
on
cask
till
then
this
is
just
average
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
is
has
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
malt
with
some
light
chocolate
notes
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
some
lightly
roasted
notes
and
some
chocolate
the
hops
come
through
with
a
little
bit
of
earth
which
is
hidden
behind
the
malt
flavors
the
beer
is
fairly
thin
in
mouthfeel
and
is
a
little
bit
watery
the
carbonation
is
low
to
medium
overall
its
an
ok
beer
for
only
being
3
2
but
give
me
their
bitter
over
this
dark
mild
anyday
light
body
soft
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
sometimes
less
is
more
sampled
from
the
440
ml
can
marked
1112408574may12
it
pours
charcoal
black
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
after
a
short
period
of
time
the
aromas
are
full
of
chocolate
and
coffee
almost
like
a
porter
also
i
would
say
there
was
light
hoppy
note
and
licorice
the
body
was
disappointingly
thin
but
i
guess
that
was
to
be
expected
with
a
3
2
abv
the
taste
brings
out
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
a
light
bitterness
with
a
dry
hopped
finish
a
good
alternative
with
its
low
abv
this
is
what
i
call
extreme
drinkability
no
need
for
a
lot
of
alcohol
barrelaging
or
any
of
that
crap
just
a
good
ol
mild
saturday
afternoon
wanted
a
lighter
beer
cuz
i
still
have
much
to
do
today
so
i
decided
i
would
try
the
cains
mild
dark
its
not
too
bad
the
low
abv
had
me
concerned
but
there
is
good
aroma
and
flavor
to
this
beer
the
appearnce
is
a
dark
opaque
color
with
half
finger
ecru
foam
head
which
is
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasty
alot
like
guinness
the
flavor
hs
roast
and
malt
and
seriously
reminds
me
of
guinness
light
the
mouthfeel
is
good
lacks
some
body
but
overall
not
too
shabby
good
session
beer
at
2
a
can
i
might
buy
this
from
time
to
time
as
a
single
but
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
keep
working
on
brewing
up
a
mild
of
my
own
d
o
too
bad
about
the
metal
bit
that
really
drags
it
down
had
a
lot
going
for
it
up
until
that
point
well
give
it
a
try
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
cant
go
higher
than
three
here
cheers
thin
bodied
and
watered
down
with
a
very
weak
malt
presence
countered
by
faint
earthy
hops
and
zesty
spice
overcarbonated
with
more
spicy
pepper
than
anything
else
as
n
the
aroma
this
is
still
pretty
bland
even
as
it
warms
with
only
faint
hints
of
chocolate
hazelnut
and
caramel
countered
by
earthygrassy
hops
not
interesting
at
all
and
hard
to
choke
down
i
bought
an
imperial
pint
but
it
would
have
been
tough
to
even
finish
a
half
a
halfimperial
pint
serving
from
dandelion
in
philly
totally
black
in
color
with
a
brief
beige
head
foam
dissipated
quickly
no
lacings
or
cap
burnt
malt
and
caramel
aromas
with
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
very
lght
carbonation
smooth
and
refreshing
feel
dark
roasted
malt
and
burnt
malt
flavors
in
the
beginning
with
a
brief
caramel
malt
middle
and
finish
finished
dry
with
no
bitter
hop
character
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
low
abv
option
with
lots
of
character
for
a
mild
ale
o
one
of
the
best
edms
ive
had
yet
its
a
fairly
complex
and
interesting
mild
brew
pleasure
to
drink
i
love
the
fact
that
i
can
literally
have
ten
of
these
due
to
drinkability
and
a
3
2
abv
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
a
good
session
mild
beer
is
thin
and
has
a
nice
roastiness
to
the
back
of
it
unfortunately
for
it
ive
had
better
milds
recently
beer
is
all
around
good
but
i
have
a
hard
time
picking
up
the
flavors
at
the
front
of
the
beer
there
is
only
a
mild
sweetness
nothing
else
really
id
have
it
again
the
low
abv
makes
it
possible
to
drink
10
of
them
in
one
sitting
but
ive
definitely
had
better
milds
this
beer
from
cains
is
what
milds
should
taste
like
witha
lovely
subtile
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
coffee
and
the
apperance
is
a
darkish
brown
and
a
coffee
like
smell
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
milds
ive
tried
and
would
be
happy
to
drink
a
few
again
other
comments
this
is
a
mild
textbook
definition
ok
well
a
mild
doesnt
have
to
be
dark
anymore
but
thats
what
it
was
traditionally
and
thats
the
way
it
damn
well
should
be
in
my
book
really
hits
the
spot
roger
protz
rates
this
as
one
of
his
300
beers
to
try
before
you
die
some
of
his
picks
are
a
bit
questionable
but
this
one
i
can
definitely
agree
with
cask
dr
duncans
liverpool
dark
nearly
opaque
black
with
crimson
edges
no
real
foam
to
see
here
as
this
is
a
cask
conditioned
brew
the
aromas
are
so
intense
and
insane
for
a
3
2
brew
omg
how
do
they
get
so
much
into
a
3
2
brew
sugar
molasses
some
spirtlike
flavors
dark
fruits
chocolate
coffee
plums
caramel
and
mroe
the
taste
is
excellent
with
a
lovely
maltiness
and
some
chocolate
coffee
and
fruit
flavors
all
over
the
place
the
moufheel
is
smooth
and
lovely
and
the
drinkability
is
awesome
this
is
just
incredible
when
it
is
fresh
and
on
cask
surely
one
of
the
finest
if
not
the
finest
example
of
this
sadly
underbrewed
style
of
beer
stout
like
appearance
deep
black
with
a
fluffyfoamy
head
looks
great
soft
and
light
yet
with
quite
a
full
mouthfeel
slightly
acidic
bitterness
some
grapeynessraisins
some
nice
soft
roastyness
generally
pretty
nice
soft

caskgbbf

much
better
from
the
tap
than
the
can
tap
is
a
solid
4
5
very
good
beer
anyone
can
enjoy
my
dad
who
only
drinks
miller
lite
tried
pub
ale
at
lucky
town
liked
it
so
much
he
bought
a
case
of
it
o
very
sessionable
another
great
entry
from
lucky
town
drinkability
this
is
one
to
check
out
great
local
brewery
that
is
doing
it
right
making
excellent
beer
one
that
ill
definitely
be
coming
back
to
if
you
are
in
cincinnati
check
out
this
brewery
it
is
well
worth
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
decent
cap
of
foam
aroma
of
nutty
malts
caramel
and
light
floral
hops
in
the
flavor
alittle
roasted
malt
caramel
nutty
maltyness
somewhat
bready
balanced
light
coffee
very
clean
finish
lighter
bodied
super
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
milds
are
underrated
and
this
one
i
could
easily
make
a
staple
session
beer
mild
in
every
sense
of
the
word
but
not
a
bad
thing
how
wonderful
this
beer
that
flows
out
from
the
brewery
this
one
time
and
into
my
glass
dark
amber
the
hue
the
carbonation
rises
slowly
and
naturally
from
the
depths
of
the
glass
to
form
a
head
that
guiness
would
be
jealous
of
a
little
sweet
and
bready
aroma
with
some
very
light
chocolate
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
slight
ping
of
citrus
accompany
the
delicate
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
dark
but
light
light
but
not
thin
nice
body
really
easy
drinking
very
tasty
a
brilliant
piece
of
work
o
this
has
awesome
drinkability
it
just
so
creamy
and
goes
down
so
easily
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
no
doubt
i
think
this
is
an
awesome
anytime
beer
especially
since
the
low
abv
i
wish
i
could
get
this
regularly
i
have
drank
many
english
style
beers
recently
bitters
and
esbs
and
the
like
and
found
i
didnt
like
them
nearly
as
much
as
i
used
to
i
thought
that
my
tastes
had
changed
as
i
was
more
into
imperial
stouts
but
this
beer
shows
that
my
tastes
merely
demanded
more
flavor
which
this
beer
delivers
clear
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
theres
a
dense
light
brown
head
that
caps
the
beer
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
the
nose
is
great
brown
sugar
toffee
a
little
nutty
with
some
green
fuggles
hops
a
little
coffee
is
also
present
some
toasted
wheat
bread
is
also
present
the
palate
opens
light
but
with
a
nice
body
brown
sugar
toffee
and
a
nice
nutty
flavor
along
with
a
mild
bitterness
earthy
and
a
little
leafy
a
little
molasses
even
in
some
ways
this
is
a
cross
between
a
more
traditional
dark
mild
and
an
english
brown
ale
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
toasty
mildly
fruity
yeast
character
this
is
expertly
conditioned
and
a
joy
to
drink
had
this
on
cask
at
victory
a
ruby
colored
beer
with
a
nice
foam
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
i
get
mostly
a
light
roastylike
taste
and
smell
some
toasty
notes
hops
arent
evident
to
me
in
aroma
or
taste
but
their
bittering
influence
is
definitely
there
to
balance
any
sweetness
from
the
malts
was
expecting
a
little
more
malt
character
nice
mouthfeel
as
its
creamy
in
texture
and
light
drinking
easily
a
very
decent
session
beer
had
a
pint
at
the
grey
lodge
pub
it
has
a
rich
cocoa
and
hazelnut
though
the
flavor
is
considerably
uh
milder
its
slightly
acidic
with
a
hint
of
oxidation
expected
in
a
cask
beer
with
gentle
roast
and
nutty
flavor
very
drinkable
and
light
bodied
if
there
werent
other
beers
here
i
wanted
to
try
id
have
had
more
well
i
for
one
am
glad
that
they
took
this
one
out
of
retirement
its
a
little
more
hop
forward
than
i
would
have
expected
for
an
english
mild
but
i
didnt
mind
one
bit
as
the
extra
crispness
helped
counteract
the
thinness
of
the
cask
feel
really
tasty
and
hugely
drinkable
stuff
id
love
to
see
this
become
a
fixture
on
the
hand
pumps
here
oncask
at
the
brewpub
this
is
a
dark
ambernear
brown
brew
with
a
small
casklike
head
of
foam
that
dies
rather
quickly
and
leaves
a
minute
amount
of
lacing
the
aromas
are
all
spicycitrusy
hops
and
light
biscuity
malts
this
brew
taste
very
authentic
citrus
hops
up
front
with
bready
malts
in
the
middle
and
a
clean
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
perfect
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
this
is
a
very
authentic
dark
mild
and
victory
has
done
a
very
good
job
with
it
wow
dark
milds
are
rare
in
the
uk
what
a
treat
to
have
one
on
cask
in
pa
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
at
the
start
with
a
mildly
crisp
finish
some
malt
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
this
is
a
decent
session
brew
as
the
flavors
are
mellow
and
it
is
perfect
for
an
afternoon
of
quaffing
beers
without
overloading
your
tastebuds
first
sip
reveals
a
thin
yet
not
watery
brew
very
light
carbonation
as
cask
ale
should
light
caramel
start
to
the
flavor
which
rolls
to
a
bitter
pine
hop
presence
that
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
gradually
fades
very
very
easy
to
drink
excellent
session
beer
overall
a
really
nice
drinkable
mild
dark
amber
color
served
with
a
perpetual
offwhite
head
spicey
pinelaced
hop
aroma
light
malty
taste
with
a
decent
hop
note
a
bit
of
a
soapy
hop
taste
with
an
attractive
bitter
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkability
a
very
good
session
beer
and
a
surprise
from
victory
after
my
other
victory
experiences
that
are
sort
of
in
your
face
flavorful
this
one
can
be
better
appreciated
for
the
subtle
nuances
behind
the
hoppiness
found
this
victory
session
gem
on
cask
at
the
sharp
edge
creekhouse
just
let
me
say
this
is
a
very
mild
but
one
very
nicely
brewed
delicate
brew
it
appears
a
pale
amber
gold
with
a
creamy
textured
tannish
foam
head
with
a
healthy
amount
of
trickled
lace
surrounding
my
glass
the
aroma
is
a
wonderful
but
tame
floral
hop
character
with
underlying
malt
tones
very
nicely
done
and
on
the
forefront
of
the
flavor
there
is
a
slight
creamy
caramelly
mix
of
light
hops
and
sweet
malt
texture
is
very
frothy
and
inviting
one
drinkable
session
beer
from
the
victory
brewing
company
beer
comes
out
a
nice
brown
color
very
little
head
on
it
but
it
managed
to
stay
around
for
awhile
the
first
thing
that
you
notice
when
you
pick
up
the
glass
is
that
the
beer
iswarm
not
really
warm
but
served
at
proper
cellar
temperature
for
this
type
of
beer
not
cold
very
full
flavored
and
malty
an
excellent
version
of
an
english
mild
sweet
malt
nose
soft
smooth
balenced
mellow
flavors
deep
dark
scarlet
color
with
a
slight
white
head
and
lace
very
pleasing
to
the
tongue
mellow
is
the
word
to
use
to
describe
this
laidback
beer
quite
drinkable
as
its
lower
on
the
abv
chart
smooth
creamy
soft
flavors
i
enjoyed
sippin
this
beer
on
the
tour
the
bas
were
given
my
the
man
ron
himself
almost
too
easy
to
drink
a
unique
beer
in
a
special
style
overall
this
was
a
great
table
beer
or
second
running
or
mild
if
you
like
extremely
well
balanced
and
drinkable
a
very
rare
treat
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
if
it
wasnt
for
all
of
the
other
great
offerings
at
the
brewery
tempting
me
caskconditioned
through
handpump
at
the
brewery
this
mild
was
originally
dark
in
color
but
the
current
version
which
is
made
from
the
second
runnings
of
the
old
horizontal
barleywine
is
a
hazy
amber
its
full
creamy
white
head
holds
exceptionally
well
it
drops
to
a
thin
surface
covering
and
leaves
excellent
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
limited
but
offers
some
nutty
malt
and
a
light
touch
of
fruitiness
the
lightmedium
body
is
enhanced
by
its
soft
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
very
nice
the
flavor
is
mainly
malty
gently
sweet
with
a
light
nuttycaramel
thats
almost
cakelike
and
backed
by
a
mild
supportive
bitterness
it
definitely
falls
towards
the
sweet
side
but
its
still
very
well
balanced
and
quite
authentic
the
maltiness
simply
fades
away
into
the
finish
lingering
gently
and
reminding
you
that
theres
more
at
hand
highly
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
true
session
beer
that
has
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
through
several
pints

highly
recommended

i
really
liked
this
one
from

of

overall
pretty
nice
flavors
for
a
mild
ale
more
like
a
red
amber
actually
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
pretty
good
reason
to
check
out
the
sampler
it
comes
in
i
poured
this
beer
and
it
has
a
reddish
color
body
with
a
small
tan
head
to
it
the
smell
is
a
little
sweet
and
has
a
malt
aroma
also
the
taste
has
a
little
sweetness
and
malty
notes
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
end
of
the
tongue
mouthful
is
smooth
and
overall
a
good
beer
i
could
see
my
self
drinking
this
with
some
fish
and
chips
in
a
pub
if
they
sold
12
packs
of
this
beer
i
would
have
it
regularly
in
stock
the
mouth
is
slightly
thick
and
clingy
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
color
of
beer
as
advertised
a
red
tinge
mixed
with
a
dark
caramel
color
that
has
nice
highlights
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
of
malt
or
hops
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
well
mild
i
thought
it
would
blow
me
away
but
it
was
just
good
plain
good
which
isnt
bad
anyway
i
thought
the
mild
taste
of
ale
would
be
something
appealing
to
me
but
it
wasnt
as
much
as
i
thought
it
wasnt
bad
mind
you
it
just
didnt
tingle
my
toes
overall
it
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
i
have
tried
again
and
again
overall
per
category
this
is
a
pretty
unobjectionable
beer
flavor
is
pleasant
and
light
enough
to
enjoy
all
day
pours
a
clear
light
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
caramel
malt
hops
slight
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast
overall
a
decent
mild
with
good
blend
and
appearance
o
this
one
doesnt
get
high
marks
on
here
but
then
again
very
few
examples
in
this
style
class
seemed
to
have
made
an
impression
on
anyone
good
stuff
i
gave
away
the
other
one
of
these
that
came
in
the
pack
but
had
i
kept
it
i
could
have
easily
downed
it
in
my
sitting
the
alcohol
was
only
detectable
at
the
end
and
of
course
that
faded
quickly
as
well
there
wasnt
much
to
take
from
this
but
on
its
own
it
was
a
good
beer
to
have
an
a
fall
day
such
as
this
between
the
darker
fruit
up
front
and
the
lighter
finish
to
this
theres
just
enough
to
hold
anyones
attention
in
this
beer
just
dont
expect
anything
more
than
mild
from
this
overall
this
is
an
everyday
beer
for
me
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
offering
i
think
there
are
better
sams
out
there
but
its
good
i
think
id
have
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
nothing
offensive
or
to
complain
about
but
just
mild
in
so
many
ways

this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
nice
sweet
flavor
to
it
would
prefer
a
little
more
complexity
a
good
gateway
beer
to
someone
who
prefers
a
macrostyle
lager
nothing
harsh
or
offputting
here
at
all
at
the
same
time
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
like
most
english
mild
ales
this
sam
adams
release
was
highly
drinkable
but
rather
forgettable
if
you
dig
the
style
perhaps
you
should
give
it
a
try
overall
just
an
average
beer
in
my
opinion
nothing
stands
out
but
no
obvious
flaws
i
would
drink
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
not
bad
kinda
bland
and
on
the
sweeter
side
decent
malty
flavors
d
overall
a
nice
mass
produced
beer
a
nice
english
red
ale
but
not
its
for
me
i
can
pass
let
it
warm
is
my
advice
summary
not
bad
i
havent
tried
much
of
this
style
so
i
cant
speak
to
accuracy
would
try
again
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
but
much
better
beers
for
less
money
out
there
but
if
amber
beers
are
your
thing
then
give
this
one
a
try
this
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
malts
and
oak
the
texture
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
and
the
taste
isnt
very
bold
either
this
is
very
light
in
taste
and
texture
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
from
the
flavor
not
in
any
way
bad
it
just
could
use
some
more
work
before
you
see
this
as
a
year
round
6pack
as
right
now
it
is
only
available
in
a
sampler
12pk
while
it
seemed
originally
outofplace
in
this
years
fall
sampler
pack
i
can
see
how
this
beer
can
be
easily
enjoyed
by
many
during
this
months
of
hearth
and
change
after
second
thought
i
can
now
hope
to
see
this
included
in
their
seasonal
cases
in
years
to
come
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
good
old
standby
of
boston
lager
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
good
all
year
i
will
certainly
buy
again
and
would
recommend
to
some
friends
pretty
average
but
inoffensive
ale
mild
and
sessionable
nothing
special
but
nothing
really
to
complain
about
pretty
much
right
down
the
middle
some
bonus
points
for
a
nice
appearance
and
body
overall
impression
a
refreshing
and
flavorful
malthighlighted
strong
mild
not
sure
why
this
hasnt
garnered
more
ba
love
but
i
wish
there
were
more
examples
of
this
style
out
there
the
ruby
mild
seems
like
a
more
maltier
version
of
the
boston
ale
the
beer
pours
a
clear
nice
amber
with
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
is
mostly
english
style
hops
balanced
with
malt
maybe
a
slight
rye
smell
the
taste
is
very
well
balance
between
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
on
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
pours
soft
amber
light
foam
just
dark
enough
to
not
be

through
pale

quite

slight

fruit
quite

fruity
even
keeled
just
a
hint
of
an
edge
at
the
finish
some
funk
but
never
out
of
check
new
offering
but
feels
like
ye
olde
beer
fits
in
the
mix
pack
for
sure
cheers
the
verdict
very
good
this
new
seasonal
is
like
a
richer
and
smoother
version
of
sas
signature
lager
this
may
be
my
favorite
from
boston
brewing
overall
a
rather
malty
and
sweet
brew
that
still
maintains
an
easy
drinking
style
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
overall
overall
a
decent

mild

true

a

light

not

but
not
a
good
version
of
a
mild
imho
overall
not
a
great
brew
and
one
of
my
least
favorites
out
of
the
variety
pack
much
better
sam
adams
beers
out
there
ruby
hued
as
advertised
starts
with
a
cherry
pit
aroma
tastes
a
bit
bittersweet
with
some
caramel
flavors
mingling
ith
just
a
touch
of
coffee
roastiness
hard
candy
sweetness
up
front
then
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
then
it
finishes
sweet
very
drinkable
despite
the
fact
that
is
almost
six
percent
alcohol
for
a
mild
this
is
quite
pleasant
but
those
expecting
something
else
probably
will
be
underwhelmed
o
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
its
just
middle
of
the
pack
nothing
really
crazy
going
on
here
meh

ruby
mild

the

tastes
darker
than
the

this
is
an
unassuming
beer
and
its

that
i
probably
could
drink
for
a
while
nothing
that
jumps
out
but
thats
quite
okay
amber
copper
color
with
decent

and
mild
carbonation
slight
malty
and
caramel
aroma
crisp
malty
taste
and
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
sort
of
lack
luster
no
real
depth
or
an
element
that
makes
it
memorable
the
flavors
it
has
arent
bad
theyre
just
not
enough
o
a
decent
brew
o
even
though
this
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
its
still
enjoyable
and
as
expected
easy
to
drink
definitely
for
the
maltlovers
out
there
as
there
is
almost
no
hop
presence
if
i
wanted
a
real
mild
with
34
abv
this
would
be
a
bit
of
a
reach
otherwise
its
a
solid
beer
o
retains
a
lot
of
character
despite
being
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
rewarding
yourself
after
raking
leaves
or
some
other
fall
yardwork
overall
i
have
liked
a
lot
of
sam
adams
seasonal
specialty
beers
but
i
find
this
one
to
be
ok
or
just
short
of
it
it
hits
a
bunch
of
what
the
style
should
be
like
not
bad
enough
to
turn
away
but
not
overly
memorable
either
overall
while
im
am
not
familiar
with
this
style
this
beer
was
somewhat
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
aroma
of
caramelized
malt
brown
sugar
and
tea
like
hops
some
bread
and
toasted
edges
as
well
in
the
taste
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
toffee
with
a
small
earthy
nicely
bitter
hop
a
bit
grainy
caramelized
malt
becoming
more
predominant
as
it
warms
medium
to
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
that
retains
decently
overall
this
is
a
mellow
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
mild
overall
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
english
dark
mild
style
but
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
easy
drinker
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
my
tongue
interested
it
wouldnt
pain
me
to
see
this
one
in
their
future
autumn
mix
releases
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
good
with
more
yeast
flavor
and
malt
than
expected
with
a
slight
toasted
and
fruity
combination
of
malt
and
yeast
with
very
low
bittterness
as
expected
and
gentle
alcohol
in
the
taste
which
adds
to
the
subtle
spice
and
fruitiness
which
has
a
mild
currant
taste
with
light
herbal
hop
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
decent
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
this
is
just
okay
compared
to
the
originators
o
its
a
decent
mild
nothing
too
fancy
but
would
go
well
with
various
foods
and
situations
overall
i
think
sam
adams
somewhat
understands
this
beer
style
but
they
cant
finish
taste
wise
there
is
no
full
bodied
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
just
ruins
the
beer
o
i
was
really
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
one
a
weak
look
and
aroma
gave
way
to
a
surprisingly
rich
taste
and
a
smooth
mouth
feel
that
more
than
made
up
for
it
would
buy
again
a
worthy
representation
of
the
style
overall
not
a
great
job
by
sam
adams
so
much
potential
with
this
beer
but
they
missed
it
oh
well
o
a
decent
enough
brew
light
and
mild
in
the
aroma
and
palate
still
an
easy
drinker
not
a
style
thats
right
up
my
alley
but
nothing
objectionable
o
always
looking
to
try
new
sam
adams
brews
so
i
was
happy
to
see
a
new
beer
in
the
harvest
sampler
overall
it
isnt
bad
has
a
good
flavor
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
watery
reminds
me
of
a
weaker
sa
irish
red
certainly
wont
mind
drinking
the
other
ruby
mild
i
have
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
on
its
own
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
well
balanced
flavorful
not
too
expensive
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
with
out
getting
sick
of
them
id
recommend
overall
good
beer
and
a
nice
addition
to
have
is
it
the
best
thing
sam
adams
ever
made
probably
not
but
you
should
grab
just
to
have
it
grab
a
glass
and
enjoy
salud
sam
adams
is
very
consistent
with
the
quality
and
excellence
their
crafts
peoples
creation
another
fall
delight
clear
deep
copper
under
a
thick
frothy
head
smells
bready
with
some
caramel
molasses
nuts
and
sweet
dried
fruits
toasted
malts
dark
fruity
esters
nuts
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
fairly
sweet
and
somewhat
spiced
tasting
not
too
bad
a
little
sticky
and
fruity
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
just
the
one
bottle
is
good
enough
for
me
i
enjoyed
this
beer
over
their
irish
red
or
any
other
amber
alelager
style
that
sa
has
it
is
still
rather
a
boring
style
but
a
good
change
of
pace
beer
for
a
hoppy
or
sweetsour
session
similar
is
some
ways
to
the
boston
lager
but
richer
a
nice
beer

drinkable
while
remaining
rather
fullbodied
this
beer
is
a
great
addition
to
their
fall
seasonal
12
pack
im
enjoying
it
its
interesting
in
the
mixed
12
packs
for
fall
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
of
it
still
well
worth
your
time
o
its
not
that
far
off
from
their
irish
red
in
terms
of
the
flavor
profile
except
in
one
facet
its
quite
drinkable
unlike
the
former
which
is
low
on
flavor
and
hard
to
drink
this
could
use
a
few
tweaks
but
isnt
bad
overall
o
just
a
nice
plain
session
ale
nothing
more
nothing
less
i
would
actually
like
try
this
on
cask
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
is
in
sams
harvest
variety
pack
this
is
an
extremely
good
drinkable
beer
its
perfect
for
someone
who
is
into
a
lighter
body
beer
but
wants
a
malt
flavor
im
not
to
into
hoppy
ipas
like
everyone
else
so
i
look
for
good
solid
beers
without
bitter
qualities
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
head
foamy
blanket
and
some
light
lacing
nose
is
a
healthy
combination
of
roasted
grains
and
light
sweet
components
roasty
peaty
with
some
spice
and
sweet
hints
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
its
not
too
exciting
i
can
see
how
mild
ales
can
have
a
place
but
at
5
6
abv
this
doesnt
work
too
well
it
comes
as
part
of
the
twelve
pack
of
october
beers
and
i
dont
think
most
people
are
going
to
be
as
eager
to
try
this
one
there
are
better
session
beers
out
there
and
sam
adams
i
know
can
do
better
nice
change
of
pace
from
sam
adams
with
this
mild
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
amberred
with
offwhite
head
very
enticing
to
look
at
this
ale
nose
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
some
toastybiscuit
notes
and
a
caramel
quality
on
the
palate
im
getting
a
nice
malty
to
biscuit
sweetness
with
some
balancing
hops
very
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
and
very
subdued
alcohol
for
such
a
high
for
a
mild
looking
forward
to
cheese
pairings
with
this
one
gotta
love
it
when
you
see
an
american
brewery
come
out
with
a
mild
and
it
weighs
in
at
over
5
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
rusty
bronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
flowers
light
walnut
and
a
twinge
of
lightlytoasted
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
more
biscuit
now
buttery
for
your
southern
pleasure
and
a
twang
of
vague
sweetness
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crispish
finish
that
epitomizes
how
the
flavors
completely
fall
off
of
a
cliff
near
the
end
overall
this
was
a
pretty
disappointing
brew
its
weak
its
overcarbed
its
slightly
muddled
and
its
in
no
way
mild
lets
just
say
im
not
impressed
appearance
has
that
ruby
color
to
it
supporting
a
thin
head
leaving
nill
lace
smell
is
mild
with
the
caramel
malt
and
light
hop
taste
is
slightly
harsh
not
real
balanced
leaving
a
salinic
bitter
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
probably
one
i
wont
try
again
i
am
rating
this
highly
because
it
is
a
smoother
well
balanced
very
drinkable
version
of
their
red
i
like
their
irish
red
and
i
would
pay
2550
per
six
more
to
have
this
available
year
round
in
place
of
that
every
facet
is
slightly
better
tasting
and
smoother
than
that
already
good
beer
o
not
bad
not
great
sessionable
overall
reminiscent
of
their
irish
red
ale
at
least
for
me
there
seems
to
be
a
fight
in
this
beer
between
the
crisp
easiness
and
the
taste
as
the
carbonation
makes
it
feel
silky
but
washes
away
some
of
the
flavor
im
very
impressed
otherwise
as
its
quite
diverse
and
quite
flavorful
o
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
when
you
want
something
refreshing
the
fact
that
its
not
heavy
and
is
incredibly
smooth
make
it
a
great
session
beer
i
would
probably
rate
this
as
an
above
average
beer
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
small
white
cap
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
the
aoma
is
earthy
and
malty
great
full
malt
flavor
but
balanced
and
very
drinkable
it
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
could
enjoy
in
quantity
on
tap
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
full
satisfying
nice
brew
ok
my
fave
time
of
year
is
when
fall
seasonals
start
coming
looks
like
sam
adams
is
kick
starting
it
this
year
with
their
fall
mixer
which
was
purchased
july
24
in
my
neck
of
woods
first
up
is
ruby
mild
never
had
a
mild
so
cant
judge
off
of
style
good
solid
beer
no
head
retention
solid
malt
backbone
with
little
to
no
hops
reminds
me
of
bells
amber
without
the
subtle
hops
maybe
that
us
how
the
style
is
intended
good
overall
beer
a
smooth
reddish
ale
that
poored
crisp
not
too
much
head
if
any
was
supringly
tasty
the
beer
tasted
like
a
dummed
down
traditional
red
ale
which
i
expected
with
the
name
mild
came
in
an
autmn
sampler
pack
which
was
suprisingly
worth
it
would
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
traditional
ale
or
red
overall
not
a
bad
beer
stronger
in
alcohol
and
malt
that
the
traditional
english
version
but
still
tasty
malty
is
the
word
used
by
neustadt
that
highlights
this
offering
and
its
low
carbonation
is
a
distinguishing
trait
mild
not
risky
is
how
its
taste
strikes
me
as
a
brown
ale
its
worth
a
try
decided
to
try
one
more
time
raised
everything
up
a
quarter
point
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
will
buy
again
overall
not
sure
what
the
problem
on
why
i
didnt
enjoy
this
last
time
whether
my
tastes
have
changed
or
whether
pouring
this
into
a
glass
made
that
much
of
a
difference
pretty
damn
good
beer
but
restricted
to
no
more
than
a
couple
o
this
is
a
very
malt
forward
beer
with
great
flavours
of
caramel
molasses
and
dark
fruits
the
lack
of
any
noticeable
hops
leaves
this
somewhat
unbalanced
taste
starts
with
ample
grain
character
a
light
fruitiness
in
the
middle
closes
soft
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
could
be
a
nice
regular
drinker
definitely
a
good
example
of
a
british
brown
overall
a
really
nice
ale
much
more
complex
than
i
thought
it
would
be
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
good
flavours
but
cloyingly
sweet
couldnt
finish
the
pint
medium
body
and
carbonation
not
bad
overall
some
unusual
flavours
a
little
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
actually
almost
a
tad
watery
very
good
brown
ale
from
neustadt
brewery
in
ontario
and
im
glad
we
get
to
have
this
on
shelves
year
round
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
offputting
but
a
little
bland
and
unbalanced
towards
the
sweet
side
the
taste
is
malty
and
coco
smooth
light
tasting
brown
ale
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
tasty
stuff
tons
of
great
malt
flavour
without
going
overboard
and
winding
up
in
cloying
territory
definitely
worth
a
shot
and
something
i
will
likely
pick
up
again
as
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
in
the
last
year
or
so
fans
of
newcastle
brown
old
speckled
hen
and
the
like
will
enjoy
its
not
excellent
but
true
to
the
style
and
tasty
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
it
again

in
competitions
back
in
2004
10w30
is
still
a
strong
tostyle
english
brown
ale
well
worth
trying
it
isnt
very
sessionable
but
great
for
a
cold
day
other
reviewers
have
already
noted
this
but
ill
say
it
again
you
must
let
it
warm
a
bit
even
just
15
minutes
to
get
the
full
flavour
overall
a
nice
well
balanced
flavour
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
on
draft
more
than
i
did
from
the
can
od
nice
and
malty
rich
and
tasty
very
drinkable
in
the
colder
months
aka
most
of
the
year
a
solid
ontario
beer
very
drinkable
but
low
on
flavour
overall
i
liked
it
but
i
get
the
feeling
that
in
a
few
months
i
wont
remember
it
not
a
memorable
wrong
but
a
decent
shot
this
particular
can
illstored
in
an
lcbo
store
despite
a
keep
refrigerated
label
on
the
can
and
two
days
before
its
date
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
best
ive
had
because
i
forgot
about
it
for
half
an
hour
dark
brown
with
some
burgundy
highlights
a
couple
fingers
of
beige
head
with
a
collar
of
retention
and
a
light
head
nose
is
mostly
cocoamilk
chocolate
very
creamy
and
milky
some
nuttiness
as
well
taste
has
more
nuttiness
and
a
light
roast
character
medium
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
at
points
medium
length
finish
good
drinkability
but
not
overly
exciting
dark
brown
pour
with
a
thin
wispy
head
sweet
grainy
aroma
flavor
is
a
mix
of
caramel
mild
chocolate
and
maybe
a
faint
bit
of
coffee
some
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
taste
kind
of
lager
like
thin
body
not
a
bad
beer
i
liked
it
but
its
just
average
d
for
all
the
low
grades
i
would
have
this
again
light
to
mediumbodied
with
a
pretty
creamy
mouthfeel
without
feeling
heavy
while
this
lacked
much
aroma
at
the
outset
this
is
an
enjoyable
quaff
with
provides
some
nice
rich
malty
flavours
while
finishing
on
the
dry
side
which
i
prefer
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
didnt
like
it
and
strangely
im
enjoying
it
this
time
and
its
4
months
past
its
best
before
date
im
thinking
maybe
age
helps
it
out
but
its
hard
to
know
may
pick
it
up
again
to
find
out
d
decent
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
this
all
makes
it
a
very
versatile
beer
it
is
not
aggressive
or
potent
it
just
has
big
round
and
lush
flavors
that
sooth
the
palate
in
a
mellow
sweet
and
slightly
warming
manner
i
would
start
with
cheese
aiming
for
melty
brie
smoked
cheeses
old
white
cheddar
or
gouda
this
beer
will
also
fit
anything
roasted
or
anything
with
char
marks
it
may
have
been
designed
for
the
pub
and
as
such
try
anything
fried
or
smoked
as
well
it
would
even
do
well
with
cheesecake
or
rich
chocolate
deserts
tasty
enough
but
kind
of
pedestrian
d
pretty
good
not
as
good
as
a
lighter
variety
but
the
pint
went
down
quick
and
i
could
have
ordered
another
but
alas
i
only
had
1
d
very
easy
to
drink
no
alcohol
burn
finish
not
too
dry
just
a
charmer
in
every
way
not
bad
ill
probably
drink
it
again
went
down
fairly
smooth
nothing
offensive
but
needs
work
to
be
considered
one
of
the
better
ontario
brown
ales
on
tap
at
cest
what
pours
a
mahogany
brown
opaque
in
the
middle
and
clear
maroon
edges
minimal
head
and
lacing
looks
somewhat
watery
and
this
impression
carries
throughout
faint
sweet
smell
but
not
much
here
taste
is
watery
mild
sweetness
with
hints
of
caramel
but
pretty
basic
slightly
better
as
it
warms
thin
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
goes
down
easily
but
definitely
sticking
to
one
of
these
this
may
be
the
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
because
i
had
it
my
first
time
at
cest
what
and
it
made
me
keep
going
back
it
was
a
perfect
stepping
stone
from
the
more
flavourful
macros
such
as
rickards
red
that
i
used
to
drink
this
made
me
realize
that
there
was
something
other
than
amber
ales
or
guiness
if
i
wanted
a
beer
with
flavour
i
still
always
have
a
can
or
two
in
my
fridge
served
from
an
attractive
473ml
tallboy
with
a
freshness
date
stamped
on
it
poured
into
a
trusty
guinness
tulip
pint
glass
stolen
from
the
winters
in
newtownards
ni
moderate
head
which
dissapates
into
a
ring
of
bubbles
pretty
quickly
dark
mahogeny
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
and
a
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
heavily
grainy
with
a
little
hit
of
yeast
it
reminds
me
of
a
bakers
shop
maybe
a
touch
of
an
earthy
hop
but
the
malt
is
forefront
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
full
and
grainy
barley
and
maybe
even
a
bit
of
rye
some
dark
malts
to
be
sure
bready
and
wonderful
not
too
sweet
still
like
being
in
a
bakers
shop
the
hop
is
still
a
bit
earthy
but
acts
much
more
as
a
balance
to
the
malts
and
to
provide
a
nice
clean
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
nice
carbonation
but
its
not
over
the
top
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
or
day
which
is
a
more
fitting
description
of
the
current
time
i
had
forgotten
just
how
much
i
like
this
beer
its
drinkable
but
not
something
ill
be
buying
again
ive
had
this
on
tap
a
few
times
and
remembering
it
being
quite
a
bit
better
than
this
maybe
cans
are
not
the
right
way
to
buy
this
one
id
be
interested
in
reviewing
the
tap
version
sometime
im
positive
that
its
better
than
what
im
drinking
right
now
from
a
can
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
rich
red
hue
clear
thick
thin
bubble
cream
head
quickly
dissipates
but
laces
down
the
sides
to
the
bottom
loads
of
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
roasted
chocolate
a
little
lactose
caramel
slight
diacetyl
stewed
prunes
and
a
little
herbal
licorice
malt
forward
a
little
floral
nobel
hop
presences
balanced
for
what
it
should
be
the
flavour
is
of
a
vanilla
spiked
chocolate
some
caramel
sugars
a
little
astringent
in
its
mildly
dry
finish
currents
and
prunes
with
licorice
roast
malt
sweetness
and
herbs
very
rich
coffee
spiked
with
honey
and
rich
cream
a
little
bready
from
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
full
grainy
creamy
full
and
indeed
rich
the
carbonation
is
moderate
medium
and
just
beautifully
attenuated
subtle
dryness
with
a
touch
of
residual
sugars
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
does
not
get
enough
credit
for
what
it
is
a
regular
tap
selection
at
my
regular
pub
and
to
see
it
fends
just
as
well
as
fresh
in
cans
is
a
great
thing
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
weak
could
be
a
bit
thicker
or
fuller
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
highly
underrated
beer
imo
gotta
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
this
beer
could
be
tweeked
a
little
to
be
a
world
class
brown
ale
not
usually
a
style
im
very
much
into
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
drinkable
representation
sample
on
draught
at
cest
what
in
toronto
like
others
have
stated
the
name
implies
this
will
be
a
thick
and
dark
beer
this
is
not
so
body
is
amber
in
colour
with
some
rouge
hints
in
it
head
rests
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
taste
is
caramel
fruit
and
a
slight
roasted
malt
suprisingly
it
is
fairly
mild
so
it
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
despite
its
name
m
watery
but
smooth
and
creamy
to
start
dry
in
that
lingering
bitter
finish
medium
body
and
fairly
low
carbonation
makes
this
a
pretty
smooth
beer
delicious
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
keeps
me
coming
back
i
find
this
to
be
a
solid
representation
of
the
brown
ale
style
and
actually
find
myself
for
the
first
time
so
far
thinking
an
ontario
brewer
bottledcanned
a
style
on
par
and
made
an
enjoyable
drinkable
brew
that
i
would
buy
again
nothing
outlandish
here
but
a
solid
english
brown
overall
a
decent
beer
from
neustadt
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
their
scottish
ale
but
would
prefer
it
over
their
lager
highlights
were
its
sweetness
and
balance
but
its
downfalls
were
its
lacking
thin
watery
head
as
well
as
its
light
watery
body
its
not
one
of
those
beers
id
go
out
and
buy
again
but
would
be
happy
to
accept
another
drinkability
definitely
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
in
moderation
i
dont
typically
assign
myself
to
more
than
2
of
this
style
in
a
row
because
im
cognisent
of
the
fact
that
they
tend
to
be
richer
final
thoughts
another
solid
offering
from
neustadt
springs
which
i
will
hope
to
frequent
again
there
is
of
course
room
for
improvement
specifically
in
the
headcarbonation
department
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
bbq
for
drinking
at
the
pub
or
even
as
a
session
ale
good
stuff
this
is
one
of
those
funny
instances
where
you
think
you
really
love
a
beer
but
then
you
drink
it
critically
for
a
review
and
suddenly
you
realize
its
not
without
its
flaws
and
might
not
be
all
that
you
thought
it
was
and
doesnt
that
just
suck
mouthfeel
is
decent
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
having
another
is
definitely
in
the
cards
flat
cola
appearance
although
i
can
see
my
finger
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
under
a
bright
light
tan
head
was
fleeting
low
steady
carbonation
looked
good
i
smelled
a
lot
of
burnt
toast
here
almost
smoky
the
taste
seemed
a
bit
uneven
with
a
sweet
molasses
backdrop
that
didnt
seem
to
blend
well
with
burnt
malt
and
mild
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
dry
adding
to
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
lack
of
balance
the
more
i
tasted
it
the
more
i
got
a
sense
that
there
were
layers
of
grainy
malt
here
most
of
it
toasty
some
of
it
burnt
but
all
of
it
a
bit
out
of
synch
id
like
to
try
this
again
but
on
tap
next
time
as
it
was
out
of
the
can
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
drinkability
this
is
exactly
what
a
brown
ale
should
smell
and
taste
like
gorgeous
nut
aromas
and
flavours
with
plenty
of
sweetness
the
appearance
is
slightly
underwhelming
but
with
a
name
like
10w30
you
cant
say
you
werent
warned
a
session
brown
ale
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
but
theyve
left
room
for
improvement
can
poured
a
light
dark
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimum
retention
and
lacing
aroma
consists
of
lightly
roasted
malt
with
little
else
noticeable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
light
roasted
malt
with
some
even
lighter
caramel
note
i
thought
this
was
way
too
watery
and
thin
to
be
truly
interesting
d
quite
drinkable
overall
a
good
session
brown
ale
good
points
for
drinkability
a
good
beer
not
your
archetypical
brown
ale
though
tastes
of
toffee
biscuits
some
bitterness
but
this
beer
is
about
malt
imo
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
10
2008
after
purchasing
from
the
queens
quay
lcbo
outlet
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
translucent
dark
brown
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
heavily
roasted
malt
some
sweet
malt
and
some
grass
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
and
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
the
flavour
has
some
roasted
malt
flavours
some
sourness
and
some
sweet
tones
this
beer
seems
to
be
made
from
malt
and
hop
extracts
rather
than
the
genuine
article
however
even
with
that
being
the
case
the
beer
isnt
bad
at
all
the
brewer
does
a
good
job
of
making
this
work
not
bad
worth
a
try
beats
newcastle
easily
a
decent
brown
pours
a
clear
brown
colour
tinged
with
red
and
topped
by
a
medium
sized
creamy
white
head
which
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
muted
but
shows
signs
of
malt
and
caramel
the
flavour
which
is
pleasant
but
not
outstanding
contains
a
mix
of
sweet
malts
fresh
berries
and
roasted
nuts
this
is
ruined
somewhat
by
the
finish
which
shows
a
harsh
alcohol
taste
despite
the
standard
abv
fortunately
this
became
muted
as
the
drink
warmed
up
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
neither
boosts
nor
drags
down
the
beer
i
could
drink
another
but
i
probably
would
reach
for
something
else
first
dno
flavor
is
fairly
roasty
with
some
bakers
chocolate
as
well
very
malt
dominant
no
hops
or
abv
detectable
a
nice
brew
if
you
expect
a
mild
d
overall
quite
good
a
nice
sessionable
beer
if
you
like
something
with
a
solid
flavour
overall
i
like
it
i
will
drink
it
again
and
i
reccommend
it
to
any
malt
head
notes
special
thanks
to
biegaman
for
the
12
oz
sample
i
often
enjoy
englishstyle
brown
ales
but
rarely
for
reasons
of
distinctiveness
and
eccentricity
normally
this
is
a
style
that
is
serviceable
and
modest
and
enjoyable
in
a
simple
familiar
kind
of
way
neustadt
however
seems
to
have
turned
that
all
on
its
head
and
taken
things
down
a
road
less
traveled
i
sure
enjoyed
the
ride
not
quite
motor
oil
but
does
pours
a
very
dark
not
cloudy
amber
brown
the
head
fades
to
lacing
fairly
quickly
you
can
pick
up
on
some
interesting
malt
characteristics
in
the
smell
the
bottle
wasnt
joking
when
it
said
malty
grain
premium
dark
ale
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
malt
is
a
bit
sweet
there
is
a
bit
of
a
coffee
like
finish
to
it
although
its
derived
from
the
malt
as
the
ingredients
would
tell
you
no
such
ingredient
exists
the
carbonation
is
fairly
mild
which
i
tend
to
like
and
i
could
have
a
few
pretty
good
beer
taste
is
very
very
wellbalanced
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
and
malty
upfront
with
a
good
bitter
kick
and
a
pleasant
nottoostrong
aftertaste
no
specific
flavours
stand
out
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
id
definitely
order
it
again
although
i
still
thing
hockley
dark
might
have
an
edge
on
it
for
locally
brewed
english
browns
this
beer
isnt
as
thick
as
the
name
would
have
you
believe
but
its
still
a
very
full
flavored
full
bodied
brown
ale
im
surprised
it
has
such
low
reviews
its
definitely
worth
trying
i
dont
know
why
the
reviews
on
this
are
so
low
i
think
this
is
a
good
pint
of
beer
pours
a
dark
redbrown
with
a
small
head
but
lacing
smells
like
sweet
malts
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
tastes
like
sweet
malts
with
a
bitter
finish
but
theres
some
chocolate
malt
presence
in
this
one
a
little
roasty
smooth
medium
carbonated
ale
i
dont
know
why
people
dont
like
this
one
very
creamy
not
my
cup
of
brown
creamy
head
sharp
hop
bitterness
in
finish
also
good
some
sweet
maltcaramel
some
nuttiness
easy
drink
but
not
special
taste
found
it
lagerlike
my
friend
believes
it
may
be
the
yeast
believe
cest
what
nitrotapped
without
telling
us
pours
a
deep
brown
colour
with
a
smallish
head
faint
malt
aroma
slightly
fruity
a
little
toffeecaramel
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
not
too
strong
on
any
flavours
mild
caramel
malt
some
fruitiness
otherwise
quite
average
moderate
body
easy
drinking
not
something
id
have
again
though
overall
very
disappointing
not
very
many
attractive
characteristics
and
some
real
rough
edges
had
this
on
tap
at
the
pacific
hotel
in
wiarton
after
a
great
week
playing
with
the
salmon
in
the
bay
tapped
a
dark
redbrown
smallish
off
white
head
reduces
to
a
full
lace
not
much
in
the
nose
departement
very
subtle
light
wiffs
of
caramel
grains
light
fuggles
hopping
had
a
medium
body
with
nice
chewy
sweet
malt
texture
fairly
rich
right
to
the
finish
where
the
citrus
from
the
hops
are
evident
a
very
nice
well
balanced
draft
brown
ale
good
name
poured
an
very
clear
and
flat
looking
amber
the
nose
was
mild
and
subtle
for
the
most
part
light
malts
the
taste
was
somewhat
interesting
but
yet
bland
only
small
hints
of
roasted
malt
some
lighty
woody
notes
and
a
definite
fruitiness
of
dark
plum
and
semi
sweet
pears
overall
the
body
was
extremely
light
if
not
watery
flavours
fade
quickly
and
leave
for
a
below
average
experience
this
beer
has
a
great
name
and
excellent
marketing
the
tap
handle
looks
like
an
oil
can
with
an
obvious
oil
theme
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
lot
more
body
and
flavour
and
was
somewhat
disappointed
the
beer
is
a
deep
reddish
brown
and
had
a
thin
cream
head
the
aroma
was
quite
mild
with
delicate
floral
hops
and
a
faint
nuttiness
nuttiness
carried
through
into
the
flavour
and
was
replaced
by
strong
bitterness
at
the
finish
it
was
surprisingly
light
bodied
with
nothing
lingering
on
the
palate
not
bad
too
thin
fort
garry
dark
ales
one
shortfall
is
a
lifeless
and
unconvincing
mouthfeel
whether
that
relates
to
shoddy
ingredients
not
enough
ingredients
or
a
flaw
in
the
recipe
i
cant
say
what
i
do
know
is
that
a
style
this
mild
and
delicate
must
highlight
a
bountiful
allnatural
maltiness
if
it
is
to
work
and
this
unfortunately
did
not
do
so
this
isnt
that
amazing
of
a
beer
o
just
too
much
on
the
sweetness
to
the
point
that
it
feels
like
syrup
was
added
right
before
they
but
the
cap
on
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
just
not
enough
beer
flavour
this
is
an
interesting
beer
tastes
similar
to
english
ales
refreshing
and
inoffensive
but
kind
of
unbalanced
taste
wise
worth
a
try
in
the
summer
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
was
weak
but
a
bit
sweet
from
the
carmel
the
taste
was
rather
complex
initally
a
watery
taste
but
then
it
finishes
with
a
bit
of
a
coffee
flavor
and
hint
of
choclate
the
flavor
could
have
been
much
stronger
overall
a
beer
that
is
decent
and
could
be
much
better
with
a
stronger
flavor
d
i
hardly
ever
drink
fort
garry
but
when
youre
stuck
at
a
restaurant
with
not
many
choices
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
to
have
with
your
meal
the
only
other
time
ill
drink
this
is
at
winnipeg
goldeyes
games
pours
viscous
dark
with
no
head
lacing
or
retention
a
beer
like
this
definitely
should
its
aromas
are
muted
though
there
is
some
molasses
in
there
the
taste
though
offers
mild
notes
of
chocolate
with
molasses
light
sweetness
and
nothing
offensive
which
i
was
expecting
for
some
reason
viscous
mouthfeel
though
perhaps
a
bit
overcarbonated
turns
out
it
was
a
surprisingly
decent
beer
d
overall
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
by
fort
garry
so
far
but
the
others
were
pretty
forgettable
i
think
this
one
has
the
potential
to
be
better
if
they
stepped
up
the
flavours
a
bit
but
it
came
off
a
little
bland
i
wouldnt
be
embarassed
to
offer
this
to
someone
but
i
would
probably
preface
it
by
stating
that
its
just
average
too
me
this
was
a
great
beer
at
the
type
of
establishment
i
was
at
it
was
really
hard
to
review
with
all
the
surroundings
but
i
think
i
picked
out
some
of
its
traits
overall
an
adequate
if
fairly
plain
offering
its
dark
its
mild
and
its
an
ale
so
theyve
covered
their
truth
in
advertising
quota
however
im
not
convinced
that
this
is
all
that
much
of
a
quality
brew
it
gains
a
weird
sourness
as
it
warms
my
previous
experience
with
it
may
have
been
tainted
by
the
fact
that
it
was
the
only
noneuro
macro
brew
available
i
now
stick
to
wine
when
i
need
to
get
my
thincrust
za
and
wiseguy
sammie
fix
this
is
the
manitoba
equivalent
to
hermans
dark
from
vancouver
island
brewery
on
tap
at
quite
a
few
places
in
winnipeg
this
beer
does
a
decent
job
of
the
style
with
the
malt
notes
coming
through
in
the
finish
the
beer
wants
you
to
order
another
with
no
huge
fanfare
pub
beer
that
makes
the
grade
yet
doesnt
scare
off
the
average
drinker
goes
down
pretty
well
makes
a
nice
change
if
one
is
in
the
mood
for
something
other
than
a
lager
had
this
one
again
recently
and
was
much
more
impressed
this
time
out
clear
dark
brown
with
chestnut
highlights
but
little
head
off
a
fairly
hard
pour

barley
mild

with
some

and

mediumlight

with

and
a

pretty
good
fairly

thanks
zithal
this
is
a
better
beer
on
tap
than
in
a
bottle
by
far
although
fort
garrys
pale
is
a
better
beer
all
around
as
i
kept
drinking
the
sour
aftertaste
wasnt
as
prominent
and
was
replaced
with
a
cleaner
blander
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
it
seems
to
be
lacking
complexity
a
few
reviewers
have
extolled
its
virtues
on
tap

ill
have
to
give
it
a
try
next
time
im
in
the
peg
there
really
isnt
anything
here
to
draw
you
in
plain
and
blah
this
reminds
me
of
a
brown
ale
would
probably
fit
that
category
better
than
the
amberred
ale
that
has
been
watered
down
just
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
in
every
category
from
being
a
good
beer
that
said
theres
nothing
really
bad
or
wrong
with
it
but
its
probably
one
that
i
wont
be
revisiting
often
on
tap
at
the
free
house
in
winnipeg
manitoba
cola
brown
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
dies
out
sans
good
lacing
aromas
are
slight
caramel
malts
and
some
slightly
bitter
notes
of
something
else
where
are
the
hops
and
the
complexity
taste
is
bland
with
just
some
caramel
malt
flavors
to
keep
you
occupied
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
drinkability
is
blah
kind
of
crap
if
you
ask
me
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mildly
malty
with
a
hint
of
roasted
grains
the
beer
tastes
much
like
a
watered
down
porter
with
faint
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
theres
very
little
hop
presence
but
the
balance
of
bitterness
and
malt
isnt
too
bad
bottled
samples
ive
had
have
been
quite
inconsistent
but
the
tap
examples
have
generally
been
better
its
a
very
average
ale
at
best
fort
garry
brewing
company
is
manitobas
largest
brewery
im
not
sure
what
that
little
factoid
is
worth
but
if
i
lived
in
winnipeg
or
its
environs
id
demand
better
beer
poured
from
a
341
ml
brown
bottle
from
a
6
pack
a
decent
looking
clear
cola
hued
body
i
managed
to
get
a
fair
sized
tan
head
before
a
quick
recession
to
a
thin
ring
on
the
aroma
is
toasted
malt
thin
caramel
some
metallic
grains
all
pretty
weak
in
potency
however
the
flavour
is
similar
on
all
counts
toasted
caramel
malts
metallic
grain
in
the
middle
with
slight
herbal
hoppiness
on
the
finish
and
very
very
watered
down
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
abrasive
with
the
carbonation
not
the
friendliest
texture
for
a
dark
ale
not
a
very
appealing
offering
from
fort
garry
tastes
very
roastedbitter
coffee
finish
with
notes
of
chocolate
very
wellrounded
dark
ale
i
really
like
this
one
i
discovered
it
while
in
winnipeg
and
picked
up
some
before
leaving
manitoba
as
other
reviews
have
mentioned
this
is
a
light
tasting
dark
ale
that
pours
with
basically
no
head
it
stops
a
little
short
of
excellence
but
is
very
good
doesnt
have
as
strong
of
an
aftertaste
as
some
other
dark
beers
and
its
the
only
dark
beer
ive
ever
seen
develop
a
huge
following
in
nightclubs
hey
its
local
5
abv
cheaper
than
guinness
and
it
wont
bog
down
your
dancing
or
have
you
reaching
for
a
glass
of
water
might
as
well
definitely
recommended
ive
had
it
on
tap
too
but
that
was
quite
awhile
ago
and
i
cant
remember
if
there
was
any
difference
between
the
bottled
and
ontap
versions
a
baby
step
stout
very
mild
and
light
kickedup
carbonation
on
tap
which
worked
against
it
soapy
glass
so
couldnt
get
any
aroma
bit
of
malt
and
foam
a
beer
aimed
i
think
to
get
people
to
try
more
craft
beers
so
some
points
over
national
brand
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
beer
with
very
low
carbonation
and
therefore
almost
no
head
aroma
is
quite
weak
with
almost
no
discernable
malt
taste
is
light
and
somewhat
refreshing
with
some
note
of
sweetness
and
malt
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
lack
character
and
complexity
and
therefore
is
very
average
11
6
ounce
brown
bottle
no
freshness
date
its
clear
amber
a
darker
amber
almost
brown
a
small
head
forms
and
dissappears
all
too
quickly
with
no
lace
just
a
rim
theres
a
toasty
aroma
kind
of
like
a
nut
brown
ale
nothing
exciting
there
something
funky
in
the
aroma
too
i
cant
pinpoint
it
no
freshness
date
worries
me
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
a
little
fizzy
theres
a
slight
toasty
flavor
going
on
and
a
nice
dose
of
hops
for
some
ok
balance
the
aftertaste
is
rather
funky
i
really
cant
pinpoint
it
but
something
is
definitely
shady
about
this
beer
it
might
be
old
because
it
would
probably
taste
pretty
good
if
there
wasnt
a
nasty
aftertaste
its
only
4
a
sixpack
and
the
store
i
bought
it
from
is
discontinuing
it
so
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
its
too
watery
as
well
it
tastes
like
a
funky
wannabe
nut
brown
great
beer
yards
makes
some
of
the
best
a
dark
beer
that
tastes
good
and
not
too
heavy
its
surprisingly
smooth
o
relatively
tame
overall
with
everything
in
its
place
brawler
might
be
the
ultimate
session
beer
its
full
of
good
grain
and
malt
flavor
without
getting
too
sweet
and
its
crisp
and
so
very
easy
to
drink
the
malt
presence
does
in
fact
have
a
good
english
ale
feel
several
americanmade
amber
ales
come
close
to
hitting
these
notes
but
they
dont
hit
as
well
as
this
one
we
need
more
beers
like
this

the
closest
american
craft
to
a
true
english
ale
ive
tasted
calling
a
beer
a
mild
is
no
excuse
for
the
beer
not
having
any
flavor
this
was
highly
unsatisfying
and
watery
to
drink
not
recommended
a
fine
tasting
mild
and
perfect
for
mild
days
because
it
doesnt
sacrifice
a
full
flavor
caramel
malts
and
significant
roasted
almond
quality
nice
floral
bitterness
strawberry
on
a

toast
no
buttery
flavor
and
on
the
dry
side
its

lingering

cover
the

making
the

was
a

that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
much

lighter
but
good
aroma
some

perhaps
a

the
taste
is
a

lighter

pretty
good
caramel
malts
but
almost
no

a
touch
of

a
faint

in

a
nice

i
am
definitely
no
expert
in
the
tasting
of

but
this
is
a
fine
tasting
ale
good
taste
no
bitterness
pretty
smooth
for
an
ale
no
head
to
speak
of
but
i
think
thats
overrated
in
the
beer
world
after
all
you
dont
drink
foam
good
color
not
too
dark
not
too

very
drinkable
i
like
it

a

this

anexcellent

sweetly
and
a

doesnt
last

dont
expect
your

buds
to
jump
for
joy
its
not
that
kind
of
beer
i
want
more
bring
it
to
california
overall
a
good
session
beer
low
in
alcohol
and
easy
to
approach
it
would
go
well
with
any
meal
an
would
also
be
a
good
gateway
brew
poured
a
deep
clear
mahogany
it
has
a
creamy
tan
head
that
mostly
dissipates
but
lingers
around
the
circumference
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
and
malty
despite
the
dark
color
with
mild
malt
notes
the
taste
is
rich
and
malty
and
the
body
is
just
light
enough
to
hold
up
the
flavor
a
great
session
ale
overall
not
very
impressive
drinkable
but
ordinary
o
not
recommendable
if
someone
buys
you
one
thank
them
and
drink
it
overall
a
decent
beer
and
i
know
its
unfair
to
compare
it
to
other
beers
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
yards
worst
beer
which
may
be
more
of
a
compliment
to
their
other
brews
i
wish
the
backend
of
this
beer
had
more
bitterness
i
feel
as
if
it
is
unbalanced
in
that
aspect
o
at
4
20
abv
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
regular
session
beer
for
me
very
impressed
with
this
puppy
o
a
well
balance
sessionable
beer
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
not
over
the
top
but
it
tasty
overall
this
beer
has
a
good
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
i
will
be
purchasing
this
again
o
going
by
the
current
trends
of
the
craft
beer
world
this
wont
get
many
beer
sippers
all
hot
and
bothered
but
personally
this
beer
really
works
for
me
its
not
going
to
beat
you
over
the
head
with
the
flavoraroma
whomp
stick
but
its
a
great
example
of
a
dark
mild
just
another
great
ale
from
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
around
recommended
cheers

very

quite

has
that

othis
is
the
beer
if
youre

for
an

drinkable

well
done

go
well

drinkable

overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
very
malty
which
is
perfect
for
a
malt
fiend
like
me
and
very
quaffable
so
far
im
impressed
with
the
yards
brewing
company
o
seeing
how
yards
is
about
as
local
as
local
gets
for
me
ive
been
making
my
rounds
sampling
their
brews
whenever
i
can
yards
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
making
a
very
solid
sessionable
pub
brew
if
youre
ever
looking
for
something
flavorful
while
remaining
light
enough
to
knock
a
few
pints
back
give
this
one
a
second
lookits
if
nothing
else
worth
the
try
oa
decent
session
beer
easy
drinking
o
a
unique
beer
havent
had
one
exactly
like
it
though
it
reminds
me
some
of
a
belgian
quad
very
nice
beer
from
a
local
for
me
anyway
brewery
if
you
drink
butweezer
put
that
urine
down
and
try
one
of
these
i
would
be
a
great
beer
to
help
ease
yourself
off
of
your
addiction
to
garbage
o
good
flavor
and
low
alcohol
makes
this
a
great
beer
to
drink
multiples
of
nice
toasty
malt
and
a
nutty
flavor
lingers
well
into
the
hefty
body
pretty
good
with
danish
blue
cheers
pours
a
crystal
clear
ruby
color
with
no
real
head
smells
oaty
tastes
malty
not
too
much
else
feels
flat
and
just
a
touch
bitter
at
the
end
really
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
kinda
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
or
maybe
some
type
of
yuengling
or
something
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
cant
recommend
it
especially
at
4
2
abv
quite
a
nice
dark
mild
offering
peasant
malt
and
a
clean
and
somewhat
creamy
body
decent
a
little
bland
but
not
offensive
sessionable
o
great
drinkability
and
flavor
a
pretty
good
english
mild
nicely
balanced
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
and
its
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
its
nice
to
see
an
american
brewery
tackle
an
english
mild
and
do
a
nice
job
of
it
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
and
i
expect
great
things
from
yards
but
for
my
preferences
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
mild
in
flavor
i
ended
up
buying
a
mixedcase
of
yards
beers
just
before
christmas
they
were
really
fresh
and
seemed
like
a
good
choice
to
bring
home
and
share
some
philly
beer
i
am
really
happy
with
my
choice
and
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
the
same
case
at
the
price
i
got
it
for
in
the
future
a
good
mix
of
different
styles
and
most
importantly
interesting
beer
brown
colored
with
ruby
along
the
edges
onefinger
off
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
a
small
amount
of
head
on
top
of
the
beer
bready
malts
in
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
very
smooth
tasting
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
lighttomedium
bodied
an
enjoyable
ale
that
is
easily
quaffable
id
have
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
o
this
lives
or
dies
by
one
fact
would
i
want
multiple
servings
of
this
in
a
single
sitting
at
first
i
didnt
think
so
but
this
grows
on
me
the
more
i
drink
it
it
does
drink
like
a
bigger
beer
at
times
but
at
the
same
token
doesnt
have
a
strong
enough
flavor
profile
that
would
allow
it
to
fully
get
away
with
it
so
ill
hesitantly
say
yes
i
would
drink
multiple
pints
of
this
at
a
bar
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
but
id
love
to
see
what
cask
conditioning
transforms
it
into
o
i
was
mostly
disappointed
by
the
look
and
feel
of
this
beer
it
felt
like
it
had
potential
o
other
than
the
carbonation
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
for
the
low
alcohol
percent
a
sessionable
dark
beer
not
much
experience
with
this
style
but
that
off
flavor
is
not
pleasant
onice
crisp
beer
id
put
it
in
the
yuenglingflat
tire
category
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
unfortunately
this
is
usually
found
near
other
craft
beer
which
puts
it
at
a
disadvantage
great
beer
good
mouthfeel
and
flavor
no
aftertase
to
speak
of
and
it
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
malt
is
king
with
this
one
very
subtle
hops
no
bitterness
just
a
nice
crisp
almost
sweet
session
ale
yards
esa
is
also
a
good
product
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bit
more
hops
in
your
brew
id
love
to
try
this
on
cask
there
is
not
a
session
beer
as
diverse
as
this
the
connoisseur
will
be
happy
with
the
color
and
drinkability
for
sure
the
is
a
great
gateway
beer
if
you
want
to
transition
your
friends
over
to
ales
from
lagers
or
from
macros
in
to
micros
clearly
not
the
best
beer
ever
but
a
reliable
pour
no
doubt
o
a
good
brew
i
love
the
variation
from
the
standard
styles
and
am
pleased
to
say
that
the
result
is
tasty
and
very
sessionable
highly
sessionable
would
much
rather
play
beer
pong
with
this
than
any
of
the
bmc
alternatives
that
said
i
cant
see
myself
ever
buying
this
beer
for
myself
overall
its
not
too
bad
malt
flavors
are
almost
there
but
the
hops
are
a
little
confusing
still
a
recognizable
dark
mild
3
5
o
i
could
drink
these
all
day
but
it
is
nothing
too
crazy
just
a
solid
wellrounded
ale
overall
this
beer
while
suffering
from
a
little
to
much
sweetness
is
not
terrible
and
could
go
over
well
as
a
session
beer
for
those
times
you
want
to
have
a
few
and
not
loose
your
head
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
will
like
it
more
than
others
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
session
beer
and
an
alright
mild
brown
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
amazing
either
very
drinkable
and
a
change
up
from
the
normal
offering
of
a
pa
brewer
very
good
overall
a
light
abv
beer
with
a
roasty
flavor
not
the
greatest
darker
brew
but
lighter
and
good
for
a
session
beer
one
to
try
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
though
i
suppose
that
is
the
goal
for
the
style
this
is
definitely
a
light
flavored
but
enjoyable
beer
that
could
be
drank
all
night
long
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
all
night
long
well
im
so
happy
i
found
yards
in
willimasport
heard
alot
about
their
beers
and
this
style
of
beer
works
i
drank
this
beer
too
cold
tonight
the
other
night
i
drank
it
warmer
and
i
like
it
sitting
in
a
english
pub
this
would
hit
the
spot
great
color
so
i
will
drank
more
dark
mild
ale
nice
dark
red
in
color
and
i
taste
so
fruit
so
enjoy
this
beer
and
other
dark
mild
ales
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
bright
tawny
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
bright
white
head
big
malty
nose
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
touches
of
chocolate
on
the
heavier
side
of
a
light
body
with
incredible
briskness
body
holds
together
all
the
way
through
with
good
carbonation
a
punch
of
caramel
malt
character
some
toffee
on
the
sides
of
the
mouth
generally
sweet
but
a
bit
of
charcoal
on
the
back
along
with
the
right
amount
of
hop
character
gives
this
beer
impeccable
balance
this
beer
holds
true
to
its
name
definitely
one
you
can
go
a
few
rounds
with
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
doing
it
with
either
the
perfect
balance
of
flavor
and
drinkability
o
not
very
good
other
reviews
speak
highly
of
it
but
i
found
it
to
be
dull
and
unsatisfying
overall
for
a
mild
pretty
pleasant
lacking
a
little
bit
in
flavor
and
feel
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
beer
from
a
very
awesome
brewery
really
hoping
to
get
to
do
the
bbq
cook
off
there
again
this
summer
hopefully
ill
go
in
with
more
knowledge
of
their
brews
and
get
to
taste
this
stuff
on
tap
so
gorgeous
in
my
glass
and
only
14
left
sigh
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lowalcohol
craft
beer
this
aint
it
try
stone
levitation
as
it
is
far
superior
o
goes
down
ok
somewhat
tasty
not
filling
not
much
of
a
kick
ok
representation
of
style
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
however
a
decent
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
while
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
sessionable
beer
this
is
a
very
well
brewed
example
of
a
style
i
never
much
cared
for
which
makes
it
sort
of
hard
to
review
on
the
one
hand
its
bland
on
the
other
hand
that
blandess
is
not
only
intentional
but
expertly
crafted
all
in
all
a
good
beer
for
a
late
spring
or
summer
night
a
little
too
fruity
for
winter
if
its
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
do
yourself
a
favor
get
some
this
one
will
find
a
regular
spot
in
my
fridge
o
not
a
bad
brew
the
smell
was
a
lil
hard
to
figure
out
at
first
the
flavor
was
light
but
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
nuts
taste
is
malts
up
front
some
breadiness
very
lightly
hopped
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
yards
roasty
and
delicious
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
particularly
crisp
or
refreshing
still
enjoyable
if
unspectacular
clearly
fashioned
after
the
oldschool
british
pub
style
ales
worth
a
shot
very
good
worth
trying
aroma
is
as
earthy
as
it
can
get
deep
malty
nose
hints
of
leather
oak
nice
touches
of
roasty
malts
and
earthy
grains
really
just
wonderfully
balanced
and
smooth
nothing
heavy
here
at
all
and
this
carries
over
perfectly
into
the
flavor
which
was
nothing
short
of
stellar
smooth
creamy
and
tea
like
flavors
dominate
with
hints
of
oak
earthy
and
muted
hops
and
a
deep
resonated
earthy
grain
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
one
sessionable
beer
at
only
4
2
the
body
is
just
full
enough
to
allow
the
flavors
to
come
out
without
losing
drinkability
or
becoming
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
not
overly
noticeable
which
is
good
as
too
much
carbonation
would
certainly
detract
from
the
subtle
flavors
o
i
dont
know
this
style
too
well
as
i
generally
gravitate
to
beers
that
kick
you
in
the
face
with
flavor
but
i
enjoyed
this
brew
had
plenty
of
flavor
nothing
offensive
and
i
could
definitely
have
three
or
four
in
a
night
well
done
o
id
try
this
again
quite
enjoyable
never
had
this
beer
before
i
bought
a
varity
pack
while
in
the
philadelphia
area
i
have
had
the
ipa
and
the
philadelphia
pale
ale
which
i
really
like
the
brawler
has
a
dark
color
with
a
great
smell
the
taste
is
smooth
and
very
flavorful
good
after
taste
when
i
am
back
in
the
philadelphia
area
i
will
get
more
of
this
ale
overall
a
wonderful
sessionable
beer
that
is
very
english
in
character
nice
and
malty
but
the
hops
do
just
enough
to
balance
this
one
out
i
will
look
for
this
one
again
when
i
am
in
the
philly
area
sits
well
in
your
mouth
tasty
enough
to
go
few
rounds
thus
the
name
pours
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
nice
deep
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
sweet
grass
nose
and
flavor
is
same
plus
some
sweet
malt
7
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
at
sheraton
society
hill
hotel
philadelphia
pa
not
sure
where
or
when
i
first
had
the
brawler
but
ive
had
it
multiple
times
on
tap
and
in
bottles
pours
a
medium
brown
with
ruby
tints
and
a
decent
white
head
that
generally
retains
well
aroma
is
light
and
mild
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
earthy
hops
taste
of
sweet
malts
nice
and
light
caramel
and
maybe
a
suggestion
of
orange
blossom
gently
hopped
and
slightly
bitter
clean
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
sessionable
overall
not
a
very
memorable
brew
from
yards
i
got
this
in
a
variety
case
and
it
was
a
struggle
to
finish
6
of
these
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
o
its
definitely
a
session
beer
at
4
abv
not
a
lot
going
on
pretty
bland
taste
for
a
mild
it
does
have
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
though
it
does
what
its
meant
to
do
o
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
had
a
pint
at
raven
hill
bluegrass
in
manyunk
pa
from
notes
written
up
in
june
on
philadelphia
beer
week
trip
o
an
enjoyable
experience
and
a
pretty
solid
session
beer
from
yards
brewing
o
i
enjoy
this
it
is
a
great
session
ale
i
would
have
no
problem
seasoning
this
overall
not
bad
but
i
dont
know
how
many
i
could
have
before
the
flavor
got
old
i
only
have
the
one
bottle
but
im
not
overly
excited
about
it
this
is
a
great
beer
session
indeed
id
like
to
go
all
night
with
the
homies
and
a
case
of
this
overall
its
a
nice
light
easy
to
drink
beer
creation
id
like
this
one
along
with
dinner
or
as
a
session
beer
solid
light
with
good
flavors
definitely
need
to
let
this
warm
even
for
4
2
it
was
a
little
thin
in
the
body
yeah
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
brown
in
color
with
a
thinness
showing
at
the
edges
it
boasts
a
wellstructured
creamcolored
head
the
smell
is
of
nutty
malts
and
spicy
british
hops
probably
goldings
accurate
smell
for
the
style
and
the
taste
is
spot
on
as
well
it
has
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
with
some
nutty
characteristics
walnuts
that
carry
on
into
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
moderate
hop
presence
again
the
spice
of
british
hops
at
the
tail
end
of
the
aftertaste
after
the
beer
has
warmed
a
bit
theres
a
fruity
note
below
medium
in
body
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
not
a
great
one
but
not
bad
and
i
rarely
give
credit
to
anything
from
philadelphia
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
toasted
malts
taste
is
breadbutter
and
various
malts
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
thin
and
relatively
smooth
seems
like
a
beer
best
for
the
warmer
months
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
id
probably
buy
again
concluison
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
as
i
have
never
tried
a
sample
of
this
style
however
i
have
brewed
ales
that
i
consider
to
be
english
mild
ales
or
as
close
as
i
can
guess
and
i
love
the
overall
idea
of
a
session
ale
my
hopes
were
not
met
and
i
will
continue
to
search
for
more
examples
of
this
style
alcohol
if
youre
looking
for
it
move
along
you
wont
taste
it
and
youd
probably
have
to
down
a
sixpack
of
this
to
feel
it
this
is
about
as
easygoing
as
a
style
gets
without
feeling
watereddown
or
massmarketed
on
a
cool
summer
night
like
the
ones
weve
had
lately
it
would
be
tough
to
find
a
better
beer
to
enjoy
with
the
windows
open
since
this
isnt
complex
by
any
means
just
about
any
lover
of
suds
owes
it
to
him
or
herself
to
give
this
a
shot
this
can
appeal
to
quite
a
large
audience
o
a
decent
low
abv
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
drinking
again
for
the
right
occasion
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
love
a
english
dark
that
is
put
together
right
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
4
20
o
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer
would
love
to
see
more
breweries
brew
a
simple
drinkable
flavorful
ale
at
abvs
this
low
but
alas
that
is
not
the
custom
of
the
times
medium
body
and
carbonation
bubbly
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
drinks
okay
alright
in
a
bar
where
there
isnt
many
options
but
not
really
my
favorite
offering
from
yards
d
the
drinkability
factor
on
this
one
is
through
the
roof
this
is
a
session
beer
all
day
long
if
it
was
carried
in
this
area
i
would
always
have
a
sixer
of
this
in
my
fridge
for
daily
quaffing
a
good
session
brew
pours
a
deep
brownish
red
with
a
very
light
tan
head
dissipates
with
no
lacing
quite
quickly
sweet
malty
smell
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
nose
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
perhaps
some
hickory
smoke
in
there
and
some
brown
sugar
almost
has
a
hickory
smoked
bacon
quality
to
it
a
pinch
of
bitter
rounds
it
off
nicely
with
the
sweet
flavors
this
is
my
first
beer
from
yards
and
its
not
too
shabby
at
all
theres
a
terrific
amount
of
body
considering
the
low
abv
and
the
carbonation
does
its
job
well
to
keep
the
beer
moving
quickly
and
refreshing
at
all
times
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
without
much
thought
or
effort
but
is
still
rewarding
with
a
variety
of
simple
flavors
the
cpj
o
very
drinkable
pretty
low
abv
nothing
very
special
about
it
but
there
is
nothing
bad
about
it
i
could
see
myself
getting
another
six
pack
sometime
and
enjoying
them
as
a
session
beer
theres
not
much
special
about
this
beer
but
thats
what
makes
it
so
damn
great
there
are
not
enough
solid
session
beers
here
in
the
u
s
so
a
brew
like
this
is
a
true
gem
o
very
good
a
nice
low
abv
beer
that
i
could
drink
in
pretty
much
any
season
glad
that
i
can
now
pick
it
up
at
my
local
stores
overall
i
could
see
this
as
a
sessionable
thirst
quencher
for
people
who
prefer
dark
beers
but
overall
im
not
very
impressed
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
in
my
opinion
o
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
light
body
almost
carbonation
freedecent
taste
with
a
dry
aftertaste
o
the
beer
has
potential
just
needs
some
more
flavor
i
like
what
is
there
already
just
give
it
more
malt
and
this
would
be
really
tasty
after
i
finished
my
notes
i
took
another
brawler
out
to
the
hammock
and
then
looked
at
how
filthy
the
hammock
was
and
decided
to
sit
on
the
back
porch
instead
highly
sessionable
great
for
a
cookout
a
poker
game
or
watching
the
flyers
or
eagles
dash
your
hopes
against
the
pavement
once
again
overall
a
refreshing
and
insanely
drinkable
beer
accessible
to
newbies
but
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
veterans
interested
i
have
no
idea
how
typical
this
beer
is
of
its
style
but
its
fast
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
on
its
own
merits
probably
would
benefit
from
some
more
hops
to
balance
it
all
out
and
maybe
a
bit
more
alcohol
to
give
it
more
character
from
a
food
pairing
stand
point
i
recommend
this
beer
with
any
kinds
of
foods
ive
had
it
with
with
sandwiches
and
it
didnt
downgrade
the
taste
at
all
this
bridges
the
gap
of
brown
ale
to
mild
tasty
but
nothing
really
stands
out
nice
to
see
an
american
example
pours
a
hazy
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
roast
and
hint
of
coffee
in
the
taste
a
hint
of
coffee
and
roast
a
caramel
sweetness
and
a
bit
watery
a
small
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
caramle
in
the
aftertaste
good
flavors
just
a
mild
though
hence
it
being
thin
the
bar
keep
at
tulunes
in
johnstown
recommended
that
i
try
yards
brawler
ale
which
to
me
was
a
clone
of
bass
pale
ale
there
is
nothing
exciting
about
this
beer
the
color
was
amber
with
zero
head
there
was
no
scent
the
taste
was
as
mentioned
above
alot
like
bass
pale
ale
this
beer
is
certainly
better
than
budlite
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
could
certainly
session
compared
to
other
beers
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
going
on
to
keep
me
coming
back
overall
id
say
this
is
an
interesting
ale
thats
something
a
stout
lover
like
myself
would
reach
for
on
a
summer
day
the
malts
are
pleasant
and
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
im
not
disappointed
with
my
purchase
and
im
not
just
saying
that
because
im
from
philly
again
could
take
the
carbonation
down
a
notch
but
a
nice
drink
overall
it
is
a
drinkable
dark
ale
properly
titled
a
mild
dark
ale
this
is
a
really
nice
english
pubstyle
ale
very
enjoyable
where
are
my
fish
and
chips
nice
job
yards
now
behave
yourself
at
the
sporting
events
overall
this
beer
would
be
above
average
if
it
wasnt
so
over
carbonated
otherwise
its
a
nice
mild
ale
o
certainly
a
mild
ale
and
its
dark
too
hence
the
name
i
wasnt
too
impressed
here
but
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
overall
not
recommended
grab
the
yellow
pale
ale
instead
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
offwhite
head
nose
is
malty
some
light
grassy
notes
light
hops
taste
is
same
as
aroma
palate
is
medium
body
light
carbonation
has
a
watery
mouth
feel
finish
is
sweet
malt
and
bready
light
grassiness
with
some
light
hops
ending
overall
not
to
remarkable
an
average
brew
the
brawler
was
interesting
i
found
this
to
be
something
different
than
the
normal
stuff
that
most
breweries
are
putting
out
these
days
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
dark
brown
color
looked
like
burnt
caramel
blended
with
a
stout
the
aromas
were
mostly
roasted
malts
some
hops
too
in
the
mix
and
some
sweetness
the
flavors
were
kind
of
on
the
light
side
i
dont
know
why
but
i
felt
like
this
should
have
had
a
much
stronger
flavor
it
ill
give
this
one
a
try
again
one
day
all
in
all
brawler
is
a
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
session
beer
a
nice
effort
from
yards
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
in
the
future
hv
this
is
my
first
english
mild
so
i
cannot
really
judge
this
brew
against
its
peers
i
can
however
say
that
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
its
quite
malty
and
flavorful
yet
only
4
2
an
ideal
session
beer
there
is
a
good
amount
of
visual
appeal
too
dark
brown
body
that
is
highlighted
with
crimson
hues
full
fluffy
head
with
mild
lacing
and
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
its
best
aspect
full
bodied
and
silky
feel
on
the
tongue
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
a
little
life
this
is
a
great
effort
from
yards
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
dr
not
my
favorite
flavor
but
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
maybe
just
two
rounds
though
the
first
glass
contaminated
the
entire
beer
by
adding
a
disgustingly
buttery
smell
and
taste
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
separate
tumbler
for
review
dm
very
light
and
drinkable
fits
as
a
very
good
session
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
day
it
has
enough
weight
to
it
to
pair
with
food
maybe
im
still
new
to
the
mild
style
but
i
just
wish
it
had
a
tad
more
character
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
over
the
past
couple
of
years
and
i
could
see
myself
liking
it
even
more
with
the
next
one
pours
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
small
slightly
rocky
tan
head
head
slowly
fades
but
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lace
on
the
nose
aromas
of
dark
fruit
apple
wood
and
burnt
notes
the
flavour
is
maltforward
moderately
sweet
throughout
with
a
slight
sour
component
there
is
a
hint
of
hops
but
theyre
definitely
secondary
burnt
coffee
notes
enter
towards
the
finish
along
with
sour
apple
on
the
palate
it
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
smooth
watery
texture
and
slight
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
sweetish
mild
it
is
quite
flavourful
with
a
nice
complement
of
fruity
and
roasty
notes
12
oz
bottle
pours
redishbrown
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
no

aroma
is
of
bready
malt
with
some

light
smooth

flavors
are
light
of
toasted

and
some
brown
sugar
a
lot
of
astringency
finish
is
short
i
could
not
finish
the
bottle
drinkability
was
average
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
no
problem
but
overall
want
too
impressed
with
this
one
have
had
much
better
beers
from
dock
street
such
as
philly
amber
and
bohemian
a
good
sessionable
ale
with
a
nice
feel
and
easy
drinking
characteristics
it
is
just
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
drinking
it
but
it
is
still
a
long
ways
away
from
something
that
i
would
seek
out
or
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
off
tap
at
the
philly
airport
this
beer
was
a
hazy
garnet
color
with
one
finger
of
khakicolored
head
the
foam
was
little
more
than
a
very
thin
layer
after
five
minutes
and
it
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
nuts
toasted
malt
and
caramel
malt
the
flavors
were
similar
with
a
strong
nuttymalty
character
though
with
an
added
element
of
tartness
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
little
yeasty
what
is
that
otherwise
the
munich
and
caramel
malts
came
through
cleanly
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
mediumlight
yards
brawler
is
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
in
bottle
form
no
review
posted
yet
but
always
seems
to
disappoint
when
i
have
it
on
draft
it
tastes
very
mild
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
enough
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
the
malt
flavor
is
not
expressed
well
with
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
the
mouthfeel
often
seems
off
harsher
than
in
the
bottle
i
dont
know
whats
the
magic
that
goes
into
the
bottle
but
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
they
cant
get
it
right
for
kegged
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
milder
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
d
super
drinkable
seeing
that
i
am
flying
through
this
sixpack
great
sunday
beer
overall
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
session
beer
give
me
this
over
a
bottle
of
macro
swill
any
day
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
clean
and
gently
carbonated
d
well
i
actually
wanted
more
sweetness
in
this
beer
which
was
a
type
of
a
mild
but
overall
enjoyed
this
succession
able
beer
will
not
seeks
out
again
though
cheers
overall
i
think
they
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
this
style
is
intended
to
be
on
the
plain
side
with
a
high
drinkabilty
and
thats
exactly
what
it
is
a
fresh
herby
bitterness
and
marginally
acidic
bite
on
the
sides
of
the
mouth
initiate
the
flavor
which
burst
with
a
musty
fruitiness
finishing
with
tiny
caramel
and
mediumlight
malt
punch
the
feel
starts
off
and
follows
through
round
and
smooth
however
the
flavor
and
feel
seems
to
get
sucked
away
dry
suddenly
by
a
cardboardchalky
wash
a
little
less
of
that
and
you
have
a
fine
session
ale
overall
i
always
enjoy
having
traditional
versions
of
english
styles
on
cask
and
this
was
no
exception
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
well
worth
a
shot
pours
a
moderately
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
a
bit
of
sticky
lacing
though
not
much
nose
brings
faint
caramel
a
bit
of
bread
and
some
mild
chocolate
taste
is
semi
sweet
with
caramel
light
toffee
and
lighter
milk
chocolate
light
feel
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
good
pub
option
poured
into
a
16oz
draft
glass
the
coloring
is
red
amber
with
a
nice
head
at
pour
the
head
fades
away
with
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
nice
it
has
little
to
no
hop
presence
and
the
maltiness
is
well
done
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
taste
and
feel
to
it
i
would
really
like
to
have
another
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
how
about
that
a
pittsburgh
guy
recommending
a
philly
beer
d
as
advertised
a
session
ale
but
its
not
distinctive
enough
to
draw
me
for
repeated
visits
apologies
overall
a
great
take
on
the
style
from
yards
i
always
have
some
of
this
in
the
house
for
when
im
craving
a
lunch
beer
without
an
afternoon
nap
afterwards
it
looks
like
something
knocked
out
the
brawler
pugilist
whether
it
was
the
right
jab
of
pasteurization
the
left
hook
of
larger
scale
production
or
some
other
factor
i
cant
say
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
its
not
the
size
of
the
dog
in
the
fight
but
the
size
of
the
fight
in
the
dog
and
this
dog
has
neither
size
nor
fight
next
contender
please
d
this
beer
is
very
light
and
has
no
real
flavor
the
tart
note
and
fizz
are
all
that
really
stand
out
malty
coffee
caramel
chocolate
toasted
goodness
i
was
handed
one
of
these
and
was
superimpressed
wasnt
particularly
beer
like
as
far
as
my
palate
was
concerned
much
more
of
some
sort
of
other
drink
but
still
wonderful
its
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
just
as
a
suggestion
color
is
dark
brown
to
nearly
black
with
a
reddish
hue
and
good
clarity
nice
foamy
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
white
cap
and
lots
of
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
toasted
malt
aroma
after
the
pour
and
nutty
aromas
when
taking
a
sip
dark
fruit
aromas
kick
up
with
a
swirl
of
the
glass
light
bodied
with
lazy
carbonation
toasted
malt
flavor
in
the
front
that
tapers
into
a
lightly
bitter
apple
dry
finish
with
some
nutty
undertoneds
as
well
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
beer
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
and
its
another
good
one
from
yards
d
this
ale
has
good
flavor
not
to
bold
like
other
ales
but
good
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
d
definitely
agree
with
the
label
that
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
small
head
that
betrays
little
in
the
way
of
aromas
except
for
a
distant
whiff
of
toasted
malts
and
tea
on
the
palate
there
are
big
flavors
of
overcooked
biscuits
lots
of
earthy
and
tealike
bitterness
with
a
lightly
fruity
sweetness
altogether
these
flavors
call
to
mind
a
burnt
apple
fritter
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
altogether
very
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
d
a
4
2
with
plenty
of
flavor
means
high
drinkability
yards
brewing
company
definitely
has
a
niche
i
have
no
idea
what
a
pugilist
style
ale
is
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
it
pours
a
clear
dark
amberbrown
with
little
to
no
head
the
flavors
are
of
roasty
malt
and
a
light
hint
of
coffee
very
drinkable
and
light
on
the
mouth
feel
not
my
kind
of
beer
pours
a
coppper
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
present
however
the
color
is
very
nice
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
along
with
some
breadiness
the
taste
is
of
caremel
and
sweet
malt
backbones
with
some
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
raisins
and
plums
the
end
has
a
slight
hop
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
low
carbonation
overall
its
is
a
very
solid
beer
nice
sweet
flavor
that
has
nothing
to
dislike
it
is
also
an
easy
drink
i
would
say
for
sure
this
could
be
a
session
beer
i
poured
this
into
my
sam
smiths
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
rubydark
brown
with
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
wo
lacing
the
smell
is
that
of
dark
chocolate
but
it
leads
to
a
roasty
bready
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
somewhat
dry
drinkability
is
fairly
good
pours
a
brown
ruby
color
mostly
transparent
but
a
bit
cloudy
spare
off
white
head
spare
lacing
and
lively
carb
strong
bread
malty
flavor
with
burnt
toasted
nutty
hints
light
body
and
slick
oily
texture
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
slight
chalky
finish
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
sweet
but
seems
to
magically
pull
balance
from
somewhere
breadcrusty
flavors
with
esters
that
grow
as
the
beer
warms
appropriate
bitterness
not
much
depth
of
flavor
but
that
might
be
acceptable
in
this
style
softer
nutty
elements
creep
in
with
the
warmth
dnot
a
classic
english
dark
mild
but
tasty
smooth
and
very
poundable
contains
enough
character
to
keep
things
interesting
for
a
multi
pint
session
i
like
this
from
the
bottleand
even
more
so
on
cask
i
have
had
only
harpoons
brown
for
this
style
before
or
from
what
i
remember
this
is
a
good
solid
sessionable
brown
brew
a
brown
brew
you
could
session
at
a
bbq
in
the
dead
of
summer
and
it
would
hit
the
spot
there
is
something
to
be
said
about
that
d
this
is
freakin
slammable
a
wonderful
alternative
to
the
normal
session
beer
drinkability
i
love
this
style
of
beer
i
could
easily
drink
quite
a
few
with
no
poor
consequence
d
well
this
beer
is
designed
for
a
few
rounds
low
abv
makes
it
an
exceptional
session
beer
with
a
great
amount
of
flavor
d
easy
drinking
this
one
down
and
decent
enough
to
have
a
few
nothing
over
the
top
or
harsh
worth
a
go
poured
from
a
standard
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
no
indication
of
freshness
appears
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
tanned
head
that
retains
fairly
well
supported
by
constantly
rising
bubbles
aroma
is
malty
sweet
smelling
of
caramel
with
a
slight
touch
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
mineral
character
to
it
as
well
taste
is
malty
with
a
light
touch
of
hops
and
some
buttery
notes
through
the
finish
light
feel
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
overall
impression
is
that
it
is
a
bit
light
and
seemingly
watered
down
but
everything
about
it
is
to
style
with
the
exception
of
a
higher
than
expected
carbonation
level
drinkability
you
know
this
is
kind
of
an
allday
sessionable
beer
nice
flavors
that
are
solid
but
arent
going
to
wreck
your
palate
body
isnt
too
heavy
and
the
abv
is
pretty
manageable
too
cheers
to
yards
for
this
offering
low
abv
and
fairly
favorable
this
made
for
a
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
experience
i
dont
see
why
you
couldnt
session
a
couple
of
these
rather
easily
d
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
getting
into
quite
a
few
of
these
without
tiring
of
it
this
beer
went
down
quick
which
is
great
with
the
low
abv
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
hope
to
see
it
on
a
shelf
near
me
soon
d
a
surprisingly
fullflavored
nice
drinking
ale
which
is
pretty
wellbuilt
for
sessioning
however
this
is
a
good
beer
for
those
who
dont
really
like
beer
because
it
is
relatively
lightbodied
and
drinkable

really
great

the

there
is

this
is
an

but
its
not
the
most
interesting
beer
around
this
brew
is
ok
but
really
lacks
any
punch
pun
intended
at
all
as
the
bottle
states
you
could
definitey
go
a
few
rounds
with
this
but
with
so
many
others
to
choose
from
why
bother
pours
a
clear
but
dark
amberbrown
with
a
halffinger
of
ecru
head
that
leaves
a
few
traces
of
transitory
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
mostly
of
dark
wheat
and
coffee
with
some
roasted
malts
hanging
around
the
back
door
as
well
the
taste
combines
a
subtle
bit
of
roasted
coffee
and
dark
wheat
built
upon
a
foundation
of
malty
sweetness
everything
balances
nicely
for
a
rich
mild
flavor
the
body
is
a
healthy
heavymoderate
with
a
light
kiss
of
carbonation

slides
lithely

an
exceptionally
drinkable

drinkability
is
high
no
surprise
here
a
solid
and
rewarding
effort
in
the
true
session
ale
spirit
obviously
best
drank
fresh
as
can
be
most
likely
better
on
draft
and
probably
pretty
killer
on
cask
d
this
goes
down
smoothly
and
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
better
i
am
getting
with
it
i
can
see
making
this
a
beer
to
drink
several
of
in
an
evening
not
a
perfect
drinker
by
any
stretch
but
decent
enough
that
i
have
no
great
reason
to
mark
it
down
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
in
terms
of
easy
to
swig
with
good
flavor
need
to
push
this
into
more
local
dives
in
philly
i
have
been
trying
to
give
some
local
beers
a
go
as
of
late
so
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
beer
the
bottles
label
does
a
decent
job
describing
the
color
amber
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
breadlike
aroma
as
far
as
the
rest
of
this
beer
not
impressed
at
all
it
was
very
ordinary
on
the
flavor
front
malts
some
hops
but
a
dry
finish
that
was
a
bit
stale
as
far
as
the
4
2
abv
goes
yes
it
is
easy
to
drink
these
all
night
but
why
without
any
real
flavor
or
warming
feeling
in
the
palate
you
might
as
well
not
waste
the
calories
on
this
and
get
some
other
domestic
beer
that
actually
has
a
memorable
flavor
and
is
easy
to
drink
such
as
long
trail
flying
fish
dogfish
head
etc
skip
this
one
not
worth
the
money
beer
was
a
deep
amber
not
much
head
retention
but
understandable
for
such
a
lowmalt
beer
very
light
and
easydrinking
slightly
toasty
had
a
distinct
maple
or
brown
sugar
like
flavor
to
it
malt
forward
and
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
good
session
beer
hop
flavor
not
really
there
but
there
was
a
prominent
but
fairly
balanced
bitterness
overall
this
was
a
nice
mild
change
of
pace
and
another
sessionable
offering
from
yards
thanks
again
matt
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
worth
a
look
d
while
nothing
will
blow
you
away
with
this
beer
its
a
good
sessionable
beer
with
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
sometime
drinkability
excellent
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
eh
relatively
bland
for
my
tastes
and
not
really
what
i
like
in
a
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
easily
sessionable
brew
a
mild
isnt
something
id
reach
for
with
regularity
mainly
because
i
suppose
ive
become
corrupted
by
extreme
beers
and
i
love
being
smacked
around
by
huge
blasts
of
flavor
but
this
is
a
great
beer
for
just
kicking
back
and
enjoying
without
thinking
much
about
it
a
nice
addition
to
their
variety
case
another
botmc
the
first
selection
from
this
brewery
was
quite
tasty
lets
give
this
one
a
whirl
this
brew
also
has
a
wonderful
aroma
of
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
and
some
butterscotch
pours
to
a
dark
brown
root
beer
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
taste
is
a
delicious
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
a
hair
thin
but
the
flavor
carries
it
through
again
as
like
the
previous
selection
yards
does
alot
with
a
little
as
this
brew
is
only
4
2
yet
has
great
aromas
and
flavors
as
it
is
described
as
a
mild
ale
it
is
spot
on
and
with
the
flavor
and
ac
a
sessioner
without
a
doubt
i
will
enjoy
the
remaining
yards
from
this
months
botmc
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
not
really
feeling
it
personally
wouldnt
really
seek
this
out
again

d
this
is

it
goes
down

its
not
extremely
enjoyable
though
the
carbonation
hits
you
up
front
with
the
slight
malt
character
with
some
grain
astringency
and
it
finished
thin
and
dry
with
a
slight
tang
in
the
hop
finish
while
i
have
enjoyed
yards
beer
in
the
past
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
da
nice
lower
abv
beer
with
some
very
nice
qualities
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
business
lunch
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
glass
into
a
standard
pint
the
brew
is
slightlyl
dark
with
a
decent
2
finger
head
the
aroma
is
faint
a
bit
bready
the
flavor
is
very
clean
there
are
biscuity
notes
slightly
sweet
the
finish
is
crisp
the
beer
is
light
and
very
sessionable
even
though
i
would
not
make
this
a
regular
purchase
it
was
a
nice
sessionable
change
of
pace
beer
drinkability
as
the
bottle
says
it
is
good
for
a
few
rounds
always
nice
to
have
an
english
mild
in
the
us
even
if
it
isnt
that
exciting
di
could
drink
these
all
night
long
probably
because
the
low
abv
and
mild
tastes
again
nothing
mindblowing
but
also
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
poured
dark
amber
with
a
finger
of
white
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
smell
was
dominated
by
caramel
oakiness
and
wet
leaves
and
the
taste
confirmed
this
especially
the
earthiness
of
oak
and
leaves
while
this
was
a
rare
find
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
the
earthiness
overpowered
the
caramel
and
any
hop
presence
which
was
subtle
to
begin
with
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
silky
a
nice
testament
to
the
style
however
the
earthiness
was
too
much
for
me
to
handle
past
one
pint
d
a
very
noteworthy
session
brew
great
beer
to
kick
back
and
relax
and
drink
quite
a
few
without
busting
your
wallet
good
rendition
of
a
style
seemingly
forgotten
by
american
craft
breweries
thanks
to
edbeer
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
translucent
chestnut
with
ruby
red
highlights
when
backlit
quarter
inch
tancolored
skim
dissipates
into
a
thin
skim
no
lacing
on
this
one
pleasant
nose
dark
malts
and
some
caramel
notes
fairly
subdued
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
also
reveals
and
earthy
coffee
ground
character
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
carbonation
level
that
approaches
prickly
simple
and
easy
drinking
session
beer
however
carbonation
is
a
little
too
aggressive
d
low
abv
but
im
not
really
digging
this
one
enough
for
me
to
say
its
drinkable
d
i
feel
this
was
great
beer
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
the
flavors
that
this
beer
presented
were
very
tasty
and
its
worth
a
try
the
very
definition
of
a
session
beer
in
a
dark
style
not
especially
flavorful
but
more
than
easy
to
throw
back
multiple
bottles
or
glasses
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
and
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
little
more
action
but
the
smoothness
of
the
cask
can
not
be
beat
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
early
falllate
summer
the
nutty
flavor
came
out
a
little
more
as
it
warmed
up
at
4
2
you
could
drink
all
day
it
would
definitely
be
a
regular
at
the
pub
pours
a
perfectly
clear
brown
with
a
thin
head
nose
is
very
mild
slight
smoked
roasted
thing
on
top
of
malts
not
really
a
whole
lot
excellent
flavor
delivery
nice
hearty
body
on
a
malt
base
slight
tang
to
it
but
just
barely
a
wee
bit
feel
is
smooth
this
is
extremely
drinkable
a
bottled
english
mild
hallelujah
bring
more
please
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
for
3
50
id
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
as
im
a
big
fan
of
milds
and
other
session
beers
but
i
found
this
one
fell
prey
to
most
common
problem
of
loweralcohol
beers
its
boring
even
when
i
really
let
my
glass
warm
up
the
caramel
flavor
was
flat
and
not
all
that
interesting
like
a
watereddown
brown
ale
not
bad
beer
but
reminds
me
more
of
the
specialty
beer
big
brewers
put
out
like
yuengling
black
and
tan
that
looks
good
but
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
personally
a
really
great
bitter
or
british
mild
if
you
are
so
inclined
to
get
technical
brawler
is
an
notable
beer
for
socializing
chilling
out
and
a
great
beer
with
tapas
or
hummus
dont
drink
and
review
this
was
presented
with
a
soapy
foamy
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
reddishamber
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
slight
haze
nose
had
a
carameltoffee
quality
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
likewise
mild
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
would
be
a
truly
eminently
drinkable
session
beer
if
you
disagree
put
up
your
dukes
and
well
settle
this
with
queensbury
rules
nothing
mind
blowing
but
very
good
overall
had
this
beer
on
draft
at
kite
and
key
pours
a
turbulent
orange
with
a
miniscule
head
no
lacing
halfdecent
biscuity
aroma
punctuated
with
citrus
and
marzipan
disturbing
flowery
taste
with
pepper
and
biscuit
malt
very
light
mouthfeel
and
thin
finish
d
excellent
session
beer
glad
to
see
a
beer
with
body
and
charachter
in
a
session
category
dominated
by
much
lighter
beers
yards
has
a
nice
one
here
theres
definitely
a
gap
in
the
market
for
a
style
like
this
and
theres
gotta
be
some
room
in
my
fridge
for
a
beer
like
this
perhaps
ill
be
upgrading
this
single
bottle
to
a
six
pack
in
the
near
future
cloudy
dark
amber
in
appearance
grainy
and
caramelly
nose
taste
is
malty
with
good
sweetness
from
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
fruity
yeast
presence
as
well
and
slight
hop
bitterness
felt
at
the
end
this
is
a
damn
fine
malty
and
flavorful
beer
thats
only
4
2
abv
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
case
after
all
drinkability
is
very
good
its
light
bodied
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
sweet
finish
d
4
2
is
low
for
a
session
but
i
think
i
could
only
do
three
bottles
at
the
most
this
is
pretty
drinkable
although
its
not
my
style
almost
a
cola
color
on
pour
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
sticking
around
aroma
is
almost
of
a
light
coffee
strong
of
malt
and
some
toffee
taste
is
pretty
mild
like
the
aroma
with
brown
sugar
malts
a
hint
of
fruit
and
toffee
very
drinkable
and
with
the
lower
alc
could
put
a
few
back
for
sure
not
my
favorite
style
and
least
fav
from
yards
so
far
medium
body
with
lowmedium
carbonation
definitely
a
session
brew
if
i
liked
the
taste
more
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
if
only
pubs
would
carry
this
one
on
draft
d
a
nice
downer
that
was
easy
and
enjoyable
to
consume
all
the
rich
nuttiness
and
maltiness
of
an
alt
with
the
smooth
drinkability
of
a
mild
ale
fairly
big
on
flavor
without
being
a
burden
to
consume
worthy
of
a
six
pack
and
definitely
one
of
their
better
brews
that
ive
had
by
them
d
a
definite
session
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
craft
ale
house
for
around
2
togo
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
and
appears
a
hazy
medium
crimsonbrown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
light
tan
foam
the
nose
is
dominated
by
rich
toasted
grains
bread
and
almost
burnt
toast
tastes
just
as
the
label
states
malt
forward
sweet
caramel
malts
a
touch
of
lemony
hops
but
yeah
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malt
a
soft
bitter
finish
that
quickly
fades
this
ale
is
about
medium
in
body
but
a
bit
over
carbonated
overall
brawler
is
a
nice
flavorful
session
beer
worth
a
try
excellent
session
beer
from
a
great
local
brewery
like
the
label
says
for
when
you
want
to
go
a
few
rounds
unlike
ricky
hatton
vs
pacman
youll
still
be
on
your
feet
at
the
end
of
the
night
after
a
few
of
these
d
a
truly
terrific
session
brew
tons
of
flavor
and
character
all
for
a

abv
im
not
much
of
a
fighter
but
ill
gladly
go
a
few
rounds
with
the
brawler
any
day
of
the
week
i
love
the
name
especially
that
it
belongs
to
a
philadelphia
company
fits
in
perfectly
brawler
pugilist
style
ale
awesome
appears
a
deep
ruby
mahogany
hue
with
a
large
fluffy
light
khaki
head
that
rises
well
above
the
rim
of
my
imperial
pint
glass
scattered
light
lacing
forms
around
my
pint
and
sticks
well
with
each
sip
aroma
has
a
slight
nutty
roasted
malt
edge
with
a
mildly
sour
twang
to
it
almost
sourdough
bread
related
clean
carbonation
gives
way
as
well
not
much

going
on
low
alcohol
session
brew
malty
semi
sweet
and
roasted
caramel
with
a
nutty
edge
going
on
lacks
complexity
straight
forward
the
tart
edge
confuses
me
almost
a
brown
ale
quality
with
a
mineral
water
edge
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
almost
carbonated
water
at
times
nothing
cloying
roasted
malt
leaves
behind
even
bitterness
drinkability
overall
is
decent
a
brew
thats
only
4

that
gives
way
to
more
than
one
brew
definitely
the
type
of
beer
to
drink
in
number
poured
down
the
center
into
the
tulip
a
deep
dark
cherry
color
with
frothy
offwhite
head
that
dwindles
to
a
white
ring
there
is
some
lacing
but
not
much
there
is
a
strong
aroma
of
burnt
caramel
and
coffee
beans
a
faint
undertone
of
malt
te
burnt
caramel
continues
into
the
flavor
there
is
a
malt
forwardness
that
isnt
sweet
as
much
as
it
is
balancing
to
the
bitter
finish
a
well
balanced
beer
that
clears
the
palate
with
good
carbonation
quite
drinkable
warmer
but
not
quite
as
nice
right
out
of
the
fridge
this
is
a
good
session
beer
that
i
could
go
for
more
than
one
round
of
this
is
an
odd
one
i
know
the
word
odd
again
but
the
mustiness
really
doesnt
work
for
me
here
not
bad

has
a
excellent
brown
almost

looking

most
certainly
from
the

that
was

you
can
also
taste
the

and
most
importantly
its
been
far
too
long
i
can
stop
hoarding
the
old
stuff
met
you
back
in
99
at
a
charity
event
at
reading
market
through
adrian

george
of
the

what
a
beer
night
very
light
taste
of
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
certainly
has
a
nice
flavour
profile
but
too
flat
in
feel
and
too
limited
in
flavour
for
my
liking
i
will
admit
that
i
feel
the
same
way
about
most
english
mild
ales
reasonable
price
at
around
au48
a
case
or
so
but
i
really
would
rather
pay
an
extra
10
and
just
get
coopers
best
extra
stout
o
drinkable
beer
without
being
fancy
quite
enjoyable
delicious
beer
very
well
crafted
perfect
session
beer
high
drinkability
and
pleasant
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
brown
color
it
had
a
good
amount
of
darkness
to
it
which
seemed
to
hold
up
against
the
light
the
head
was
thin
and
cream
colored
it
didnt
really
lace
or
have
much
retention
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
brown
sugar
notes
along
with
some
raosted
malts
and
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
pretty
good
bitterness
to
it
mostly
from
the
dark
malts
i
think
could
have
been
from
the
hops
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
on
the
thinner
sidebut
remains
pretty
drinkable
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
with
drinking
it
again
it
pours
a
dark
murky
copper
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
chocolatecaramel
and
fruity
spicy
hopsit
has
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
light
coffeechocolate
maltsdark
cherries
and
finished
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
and
overall
yeah
its
alright
and
better
than
the
macro
offerings
out
there
but
thats
it
a
beer
that
i
believe
perfect
for
a
cold
winters
night
watching
the
football
it
is
a
tasty
dark
ale
that
still
allows
for
drinking
during
a
prolonged
session
the
biggest
disappointment
is
the
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
much
food
match
meat
pie
with
mushy
peas
classic
australian
fare
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
nice
touch
of
malt
complexity
this
is
a
good
sessionable
dark
beer
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
dark
malt
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
the
flavor
is
dark
malt
with
some
light
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
medium
carbonation
nothing
to
this
should
a
brown
ale
act
like
a
summer
drinker
even
to
style
this
could
have
a
lot
more
character
slightly
watery
high
carbonation
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
dark
mild
beers
out
there
that
i
would
choose
before
this
one
the
taste
is
also
mild
mostly
just
toasty
with
light
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
singed
leaves
it
is
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
just
dry
and
watery
it
is
thin
and
very
light
the
finish
is
little
like
old
coffee
grounds
and
burnt
toast
in
water
although
it
grows
on
me
a
bit
with
the
wateriness
decreasing
it
doesnt
do
much
i
havent
had
many
dark
milds
but
moorehouses
black
cat
is
far
superior
dirty
dark
brown
almost
black
huge
fluffy
offwhite
head
im
waiting
for
it
to
warm
up
its
not
icy
cold
though
out
of
the
fridge
for
about
20min
because
it
just
isnt
giving
much
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
chicory
and
a
touch
of
nuts
but
im
almost
snorting
the
beer
to
get
it
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
mild
bitterness
medbody
pleasant
enough
beer
but
not
the
best
from
the
coopers
stable
nice
and
drinkable
drinkability
most
of
the
coopers
have
been
poopers
but
this
dark
ale
well
its
downright
acceptable
fairly
light
mouthfeel
and
a
lack
of
body
make
this
one
not
a
personal
favorite
it
is
one
however
that
is
light
in
abv
and
fairly
drinkable
for
that
reason
alone
poured
a
12
7oz
bottle
into
my
brother
thelonious
goblet
when
poured
this
beer
really
reminded
me
the
way
that
root
beer
pours
pretty
much
the
same
color
and
same
effervescent
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
malts
brown
sugar
and
just
a
bit
of
plum
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
chocolate
malts
dominating
the
flavor
profile
but
just
a
hint
of
plum
skins
and
apple
comes
through
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
dry
almost
a
little
to
dry
actually
this
would
be
a
great
lunch
beer
something
you
could
sit
down
to
a
meal
with
and
enjoy
2
or
3
and
still
be
able
to
fully
function
afterwards
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
you
can
see
the
tiny
bits
of
grain
floating
in
this
beer
almost
motionless
14
inch
head
with
low
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
some
sweet
malt
but
mostly
chocolatebrown
sugar
aromas
fits
the
style
very
smooth
low
carbonation
and
fairly
crisp
mouth
feel
tastes
of
roasted
malts
all
throughout
the
beer
especially
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
coffee
flavor
but
an
additional
more
memorable
bitterness
overall
i
was
expecting
more
body
than
there
was
too
watery
for
my
taste
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
not
really
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
drop
i
will
pick
up
some
more
given
its
quite
cheap
d
in
the
end
its
just
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
tastes
despite
being
a
nice
sessionable
change
of
pace
in
terms
of
color
and
roasted
flavors
this
beer
comes
a
little
too
close
to
tasting
like
a
cola
d
nevertheless
i
did
enjoy
it
although
carlton
black
dark
ale
in
my
books
had
more
bite
i
would
definately
have
again
mdlight
body
and
a
bit
overcarbonated
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
but
im
not
sure
why
i
ever
would
i
although
have
cooked
with
it
and
have
found
decent
results
with
marinades
and
bastes
d
if
you
have
the
opition
pass
worth
a
try
a
very
deep
copper
colour
with
a
shortlived
creamy
head
i
got
very
little
aroma
and
the
taste
was
pretty
bland
as
well
theres
a
moderate
bready
dark
chocolate
taste
a
bit
roasty
but
nothing
lipsmacking
its
a
bit
like
a
macro
and
coopers
are
on
the
verge
of
being
a
macro
theres
a
slight
metallic
note
kinda
like
tooheys
old
but
not
as
bad
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
bit
thin
all
in
all
this
is
rather
underwhelming
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
just
unexciting
id
drink
it
again
but
never
buy
it
again
poured
a
dark
chocolatey
colour
with
very
little
head
that
disappears
after
a
little
while
is
rather
cloudy
and
has
a
very
sweet
chocolatecaramel
aroma
taste
is
quite
sweet
caramelly
and
light
lighter
flavour
than
expected
with
a
mild
fizz
not
as
heavy
a
mouthfeel
as
expected
from
this
type
of
beer
but
still
has
some
body
something
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
i
tried
a
six
pack
of
six
different
coopers
brews
that
i
picked
up
from
total
wine
and
more
in
fort
myers
this
was
a
nice
one
poured
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
smelled
of
roasted
malts
hint
of
caramel
some
brewed
coffee
tasted
of
roasted
coffee
with
a
good
hop
balance
and
a
semi
dry
finish
very
nice
for
an
organic
beer
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
ultimately
a
little
disappointing
its
frustrating
just
how
short
this
falls
of
something
great
d
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
i
would
recommend
it
for
anyone
looking
for
a
mild
ale
with
a
little
more
mellow
sweet
flavors
than
a
paler
mild
pours
a
cloudy
and
hazed
brown
with
a
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
at
all
nose
is
malty
and
caramel
sweet
flavor
is
a
fair
bit
of
coffee
but
a
lot
of
bitter
on
there
too
which
i
think
detracts
as
you
go
on
the
bitter
leaves
and
the
smoother
coffee
tones
dominate
more
so
as
time
goes
on
even
those
tones
get
washed
out
by
a
watery
flavor
profile
potential
but
doesnt
come
through
when
it
needs
to
feel
is
a
bit
lower
on
carbonation
on
the
liquid
level
it
is
fairly
average
overall
a
fairly
low
performance
on
this
one
its
the
first
i
have
tried
of
this
style
so
i
get
another
tally
mark
on
the
stats
list
but
i
cant
say
this
is
really
worth
cracking
open
pretty
drinkable
but
i
keep
wanting
more
flavor
from
this
i
really
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
this
was
the
first
time
ive
tried
swirling
the
yeast
before
pouring
it
in
a
coopers
and
it
is
the
most
ive
ever
enjoyed
a
coopers
not
sure
whether
this
is
more
due
to
the
better
mixing
of
the
yeast
or
that
this
is
just
a
better
beer
than
the
others
either
way
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
heaps
of
flavour
for
just
4
5
abv
being
a
coopers
it
is
priced
competitively
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
d
a
good
beer
easily
drinkable
definitely
mild
on
the
hops
didnt
taste
any
in
here
would
be
a
good
session
beer
just
got
to
be
careful
on
that
next
pour
these
coopers
beers
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
sediment
to
them
probably
the
only
english
mild
i
have
ever
had
they
are
a
hard
style
to
find
but
i
think
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
though
i
dont
have
much
to
go
on
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
tawny
hues
when
held
up
to
light
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
very
faint
chocolate
and
nutty
caramel
notes
it
is
a
nice
aroma
but
is
so
faint
that
it
is
grueling
to
find
the
taste
is
of
a
lot
more
noticable
than
the
aroma
it
is
of
nutty
caramel
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
grounds
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
appropriately
low
carbonatnion
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
is
certainly
not
a
priority
its
not
something
ill
buy
again
and
im
not
even
particularly
happy
ive
now
tried
it
its
one
to
avoid
if
you
were
looking
for
a
thick
texture
and
some
complexity
got
this
bottle
in
an
auction
package
hope
it
comes
at
a
good
price
in
the
down
under
i
wouldnt
mind
sucking
a
sixer
of
these
boys
down
id
much
rather
drink
a
porter
or
stout
that
has
a
similar
abv
but
much
more
flavour
12
7
oz
bottle
conditioned
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
into
my
nonic
a
deep
copperybrown
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
leading
up
to
a
loose
halfinch
tan
head
that
reduces
to
a
small
collar
depositing
little
lace
the
aroma
is
simple
yet
pleasant
with
notes
of
caramel
and
nutty
malts
the
flavor
adds
to
this
toasted
malts
molasses
appledark
fruits
smoke
and
some
grassy
hops
behind
it
all
contributing
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
it
feels
light
to
medium
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
finish
overall
an
easytodrink
real
ale
that
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
pours
dark
with
very
little
head
that
disappears
right
away
little
to
no
aromas
but
there
is
a
hint
of
coffe
and
malt
when
you
take
your
first
sip
dont
blink
you
might
miss
the
flavor
a
quick
hint
of
coffee
hits
the
palate
and
then
nothing
the
thinness
disapates
quickly
in
your
mouth
with
a
dry
finish
and
nothing
almost
like
you
didnt
drink
anything
definately
not
a
fan
i
definitely
liked
this
better
than
the
sparkling
ale
while
still
cold
i
got
some
nice
cocoa
flavors
that
likened
this
beer
to
a
light
porter
still
sweet
yeast
flavors
overcome
the
grains
and
make
for
a
somewhat
bland
drink
not
a
bad
option
if
i
were
in
australia
but
not
worth
picking
up
as
an
import
a
brown
in
color
no
head
to
speak
of
s
lots
of
nuts
and
some
faint
spice
with
a
little
sweetness
t
more
nuts
some
toffee
and
sugar
m
kind
of
light
with
little
going
on
d
it
is
still
easy
to
drink
mainly
as
its
a
low
abv
it
isnt
offensive
and
probably
pairs
well
with
some
meals
just
an
average
beer
overall
overall
not
the
best
offereing
from
coopers
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
sixpack
to
bring
to
a
party
this
would
be
a
great
nonlager
snag
that
would
go
down
well
with
macro
drinkers
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
much
like
a
black
lager
with
a
plentitude
of
dark
malts
and
no
hops
the
taste
is
much
like
a
black
lager
with
the
same
taste
and
body
as
a
stout
but
the
effervescence
of
a
light
lager
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
nut
taste
to
it
much
like
the
nut
brown
offered
by
the
same
brand
the
aftertaste
is
perhaps
whats
most
special
there
is
the
same
lingering
of
dark
malts
and
also
the
hint
of
candy
and
molasses
a
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
but
still
well
worth
a
try
dark
brown
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
didnt
last
long
a
small
amount
of
sediment
is
present
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
very
mild
as
the
style
suggests
it
feels
almost
like
perrier
with
a
little
less
carbonation
i
can
feel
the
roasted
malt
flavors
trying
to
get
through
but
its
just
not
strong
enough
maybe
this
style
just
isnt
for
me
but
it
seems
sort
of
like
a
watered
down
porter
or
stout
pours
a
deep
clear
mahogany
with
minimal
head
that
is
soon
gone
also
noted
bits
of
yeast
in
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
is
of
caramelly
dark
malt
has
a
rich
mellow
wellbalanced
taste
thats
easy
to
swallow
finish
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
find
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
could
easily
throw
a
few
down
drinks
okay
shouldve
known
a
beer
this
low
in
abv
wouldnt
fare
well
with
its
transpacific
journey
overall
it
is
drinkable
goes
down
rather
easy
certainly
lacking
in
some
respects
but
worth
trying
if
you
havent
had
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
coopers
offerings
go
for
the
stout
instead
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
easy
to
forget
a
flat
start
for
a
first
look
the
head
races
away
like
it
has
to
be
somewhere
theres
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
that
sort
of
replaces
the
bubbling
you
might
expect
since
there
is
none
a
decent
syrupy
scotch
browngarnet
hue
the
aroma
is
a
like
hazelnut
with
some
toasty
malts
and
folgers
coffee
grounds
the
taste
has
some
slight
dry
malts
that
gice
a
roasted
chestnut
flavor
at
first
then
some
light
wholegrain
wheat
toast
the
palate
is
nice
and
medium
bodied
yet
full
very
drinkable
and
could
become
sessionable
very
easy
drinkability
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pint
either
id
drink
this
for
morning
tea
if
i
was
allowed
to
average
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
did
nothing
for
me
aroma
weak
appearance
average
and
the
flavor
was
okay
but
nothing
stood
out
in
the
taste
really
enjoyed
the
coopers
sparkling
ale
and
pale
ale
and
was
looking
forward
to
another
fine
beer
from
coopers
but
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
coopers
dark
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
lots
of
yeast
floating
throughout
the
glass
i
didnt
realize
i
should
have
decanted
it
from
a
brown
12
7
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
tough
to
pick
up
on
this
one
not
much
there
taste
is
fairly
light
too
especially
for
something
this
color
mild
malty
and
nutty
flavors
i
guess
not
bad
but
not
particularly
flavorful
worth
a
try
poured
a
very
deep
mahogony
color
with
initail
large
puffy
offwhite
head
head
quickly
fell
to
a
thin
coating
with
no
lacing
present
smell
is
a
rich
combination
of
roasted
malt
caramel
taste
is
even
better
than
the
smell
with
a
nice
coffee
taste
present
in
addition
to
the
roasted
malt
and
caramel
fiinished
with
a
slight
dryness
which
is
the
perfect
ending
to
this
beer
very
drinkable
perfect
session
beer
plenty
of
baker
dry
chocolate
there
is
a
charred
woody
presencet
that
gives
it
a
nice
balancer
with
its
bitterness
but
also
some
depth
fruitiness
is
present
but
more
or
less
an
afterthought
and
never
really
makes
a
name
for
itself
other
than
suggestions
at
best
from
my
short
experience
this
seems
more
like
a
subdued
porter
or
a
brown
than
a
true
english
mild
all
said
its
still
not
that
great
but
decent
im
unable
to
compare
coppers
dark
ale
to
other
english
dark
meeks
because
its
the
first
one
that
ive
had
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
sessionable
dark
ale
that
looks
the
part
give
this
one
a
go
if
youre
looking
for
even
a
modest
amount
of
flavor
keep
looking
dark
mild
ale
too
mild
pours
out
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
or
lace
appears
to
have
low
carbonation
aromas
of
well
near
nothing
is
that
malt
i
smell
i
cant
tell
flavors
were
flat
and
mild
roasted
malt
some
grains
and
cocoa
bland
mouthfeel
was
good
as
the
carbonation
made
its
way
to
the
tongue
and
was
well
received
drinkability
isnt
great
im
suprised
that
coopers
cant
do
better
than
this
look
to
the
sparkling
ale
instead
drinkability
i
admit
i
dont
know
as
much
about
the
style
as
i
probably
should
but
i
like
this
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
ahh
another
coopers
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
just
short
of
black
color
and
a
small
white
head
sediment
still
ingered
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
as
well
nose
had
some
coffee
tones
a
bit
of
raisin
small
amounts
of
chocolate
were
present
also
taste
had
some
of
the
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
a
nutty
character
starting
off
sweet
and
ending
a
bit
sour
and
bitter
the
beer
did
come
full
circle
as
far
as
meshing
the
flavors
together
it
was
medium
bodied
with
a
low
alcohol
content
making
it
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
you
ask
me
another
good
job
from
coopers
im
never
reluctant
to
pick
up
one
of
their
beers
from
off
the
shelf
this
beer
is
different
and
interesting
but
im
just
not
into
it
ive
had
coopers
sparkling
ale
which
is
awesome
and
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
drinkable
by
not
my
choice
for
a
session
suggest
trying
some
better
examples
of
this
english
dark
ale
style
the
taste
is
pretty
dry
up
front
and
in
fact
throughout
there
is
a
touch
of
caramellike
sweetness
but
this
beer
remains
light
on
the
palate
throughout
the
finish
is
sharp
with
a
bit
of
hopbitterness
and
a
lingering
note
of
roasted
coffee
beans
the
roasted
coffee
notes
lightly
dust
the
entire
flavor
of
this
brew
all
in
all
each
of
the
flavors
in
this
brew
are
fairly
light
this
is
not
a
brew
that
demands
your
attention
instead
it
is
an
easily
quaffed
brew
nice
and
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
roasted
malt
is
dominant
here
with
just
a
slight
bitternessastringency
at
the
end
that
tells
of
hops
decent
mouthfeel
makes
this
for
an
enjoyable
experience
overall
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
wow
me
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
mild
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
its
dry
and
toastey
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
thin
crystal
and
roasted
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
earthy
with
some
yeast
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
nothing
id
buy
again
coopers
beers
are
run
of
the
mill
and
nothing
special
but
they
drink
well
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
the
initial
smell
may
well
put
you
off
completely
the
taste
is
pretty
yummy
i
thought
nutty
clean
and
crisp
with
nearly
no
aftertaste
nearly
no
hops
either
which
i
was
a
bit
sad
about
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
my
expectations
given
the
dark
color
of
the
beer
but
nevertheless
had
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
it
was
possible
a
little
overcarbonated
and
a
wee
bit
sodalike
in
my
memory
but
still
not
bad
not
one
of
coopers
best
beers
but
youd
be
streching
it
to
say
that
its
a
bad
beer
d
wouldnt
try
this
again
dark
root
beer
colored
paltry
even
foam
scented
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
only
mildly
the
bouquet
is
almost
imperceptable
and
this
is
at
about
55
deg
f
from
a
riedel
chianti
glass
bone
dry
gassy
savory
cocoa
flavors
provide
some
bitterness
low
acid
exceedingly
neutral
flavored
actually
this
is
kind
of
impressive
it
would
seem
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
alcohol
or
off
flavors
to
dominate
yet
they
cant
be
detected
still
not
a
beer
i
will
ever
crave
easy
to
finish
hard
to
remember
hard
to
believe
the
same
brewery
makes
coopers
sparkling
ale
a
beer
so
miraculaously
alive
with
flavor
because
i
couldnt
taste
any
flavours
early
in
the
palate
i
wouldnt
like
to
drink
a
large
amount
of
this
brew
in
a
session
a
very
dark
brown
beer
with
deep
mahogony
highlights
a
samll
light
brown
head
dissapears
quickly
there
is
a
rich
malty
aroma
with
a
strong
coffee
character
there
is
a
sparkling
sweetness
the
tha
start
of
the
taste
followed
by
a
robust
coffee
character
witha
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
on
the
finish
a
very
tasty
treat
remindes
me
of
a
light
batic
porter
a
good
ale
one
of
my
longterm
favourites
drinkability
yeah
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
not
too
strong
not
weak
just
about
right
decent
beer
but
nothing
very
good
either
still
makes
for
good
easy
sipping
drinkability
notes
a
tasty
brew
nothing
earth
shattering
ill
chalk
this
one
as
a
great
lunch
time
brew

i
paired
it
with
a
press
boursin
cheese
and
roasted
beef
on
pumpernickel
sandwich
i
guess
its
tough
to
stand
out
when
your
objective
is
to
make
a
standard
dark
ale
though
i
think
that
has
been
well
accomplished
easily
drinkable
and
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
for
a
session
on
a
cool
night
taste
is
very
light
and
fleeting
dry
toasted
malts
with
some
more
malts
a
little
fruitybut
not
really
almost
no
taste
really
fizzy
sharpish
carbonation
is
strangely
refreshing
and
a
little
shocking
overall
it
seems
that
english
style
milds
are
so
misunderstood
or
is
that
under
appreciated
i
dont
know
but
they
are
easy
to
sleight
it
seems
what
i
do
know
is
that
i
found
this
very
fresh
sample
to
be
extremely
quaffable
and
quite
tasty
given
its
4
5
abv
i
make
no
bones
about
the
fact
that
i
am
a
big
fan
of
english
dark
milds
and
i
will
admit
that
i
actually
quite
enjoyed
this
aussie
example
from
down
under
not
the
best
but
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
others
make
out
though
it
needs
to
be
fresh
though
me
thinks
well
it
was
a
decent
substitute
for
a
dunkel
lager
in
my
reduction
sauce
but
didnt
quite
have
the
same
amount
of
sweet
caramelly
flavors
and
you
could
taste
the
yeast
even
after
some
rough
extended
boiling
on
the
drinking
side
this
was
terrible
i
guess
coopers
is
proud
of
their
yeast
but
like
the
bottles
of
sparkling
and
vintage
ales
they
make
this
dark
ale
was
dominated
by
its
facetwisting
carbonation
and
sharp
cutting
yeast
the
beer
escapes
the
bottle
a
beclouded
deep
mahogany
to
almost
brown
color
the
head
substantial
and
the
texture
frothy
the
color
a
toothsome
light
tan
with
the
lace
a
solid
sheet
to
encircle
the
glass
nose
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
hints
of
caramel
crisp
and
fresh
with
the
start
lightly
sweet
the
top
light
in
its
feel
upon
the
palate
finish
is
meek
in
acidity
the
hops
mild
and
pleasant
with
the
aftertaste
dry
a
drinkable
but
barely
average
beer
they
could
do
this
beer
a
whole
lot
better
still
goes
down
quite
nicely
and
certainly
isnt
offensive
in
any
way
i
just
expect
a
lot
more
from
these
guys
with
a
beer
like
this
a
fairly
simple
brew
but
very
drinkable
ok
some
guy
beermailed
me
and
abused
me
about
my
rating
look
i
dont
really
like
the
stuff
that
much
and
you
cant
force
me
too
this
was
deep
brown
in
colour
quite
oily
dry
but
lacks
a
lot
of
character
also
perhaps
a
bit
sticky
im
sorry
but
i
really
cant
see
anyhting
in
this
brew
which
appeals
to
me
but
its
not
horrific
at
all
its
quite
drinkable
typically
english
beer
taste
just
not
my
mainstay
o
a
dryer
rather
than
sweeter
version
of
the
style
but
well
worth
trying
to
understand
and
enjoy
the
style
and
how
complex
a
low
abv
beer
can
be
14
9
oz
can
poured
into
an
english
pint
its
okay
tastes
pretty
similar
to
regular
smithwicks
it
is
easy
enough
to
put
down
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
refuse
one
if
offered
but
i
am
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
more
overall
i
expected
this
to
be
identical
to
the
generous
ale
that
came
in
the
same
guinness
christmas
pack
thankfully
it
wasnt
more
flavor
and
generally
sturdier
overall
i
might
not
rush
back
to
it
but
its
a
nice
offering
o
english
dark
milds
are
session
beers
and
thats
what
this
is
its
not
complex
but
is
very
drinkable
its
ok
tastes
like
an
off
the
shelf
at
the
grocery
store
kinda
beer
budwiser
or
some
other
college
frat
party
yellow
piss
beer
large
hit
of
nearly
flavorless
but
stinging
carbonation
and
hopes
in
the
beginning
mild
hint
of
beer
taste
in
the
middle
and
slightly
a
mild
random
grocery
store
beer
taste
at
the
end
yet
another
smithwicks
affair
i
swear
theyre
all
identical
much
like
newcastle
dark
brown
in
color
the
beer
has
a
nice
head
and
a
clarity
when
held
to
the
light
the
smell
is
faint
distant
malt
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
an
underlying
sweetness
slim
body
thinner
than
it
could
be
this
is
an
average
uninteresting
brew
overall
not
the
worst
thing
i
have
ever
tasted
this
beer
is
actually
well
balanced
and
has
some
pretty
good
hop
character
and
a
nice
enough
mouth
feel
it
is
even
one
of
the
better
and
more
balanced
beers
to
be
produced
by
smithwicks
im
new
to
reviewing
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
it
looks
like
a
glass
of
coke
smells
of
slightly
sweet
cherries
and
roasted
malt
taste
of
roasted
malt
is
weak
and
watery
with
no
complexity
to
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
the
can
says
its
a
full
bodied
winter
ale
i
found
that
to
be
very
disappointing
not
something
i
would
buy
again
if
your
looking
for
something
with
an
interesting
style
and
complex
flavor
look
elsewhere
it
didnt
really
stick
out
to
me
as
anything
special
and
i
could
name
a
number
of
beers
in
the
same
category
that
ive
enjoyed
more
its
a
totally
different
beast
than
alot
of
other
smithwicks
which
is
sad
to
say
however
i
can
see
it
being
enjoyable
none
the
less
it
isnt
as
boring
as
a
drugstore
beer
and
there
is
a
somewhat
different
taste
and
if
you
like
guinness
there
is
a
very
distant
flavor
similar
to
that
in
it
for
the
price
i
guess
not
awful
but
you
deserve
better
my
friends
a
really
poor
beer
im
afraid
and
one
that
was
both
too
bland
and
too
simple
with
not
enough
going
on
to
distract
from
what
was
basically
bitterness
and
some
roasted
flavours
avoid
this
one
if
you
like
beer
with
some
flavour
o
not
particularly
impressive
would
definitely
benefit
from
some
more
flavors
especially
spices
like
cloves
in
a
winter
seasonal
ale
reminds
me
of
a
mix
beween
guinness
draught
and
smithwicks
red
ale
the
price
and
easydrinking
makes
this
a
nice
winter
session
beer
and
the
value
isnt
bad
this
one
grew
on
me
as
i
made
my
way
through
a
can
pleasant
chocolate
maltiness
and
dark
fruit
coupled
with
some
earthy
spice
flavors
to
provide
added
interest
however
things
might
get
dull
if
one
actually
tried
a
full
session
and
the
sweetness
would
probably
get
overbearing
seems
bulkier
than
your
average
mild
had
this
out
west
really
enjoyed
it
wish
we
could
have
it
in
ontario
f
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
an
easy
drinking
english
dark
mild
by
nelson
the
roasted
characteristic
to
the
nuttiness
makes
this
stand
out
i
would
of
liked
to
see
a
little
more
to
the
appearance
in
particular
the
head
otherwise
this
brew
is
session
worthy
pretty
disappointing
stuff
that
i
doubt
ill
ever
drink
again
i
havent
had
the
best
luck
with
this
brewery
so
far
o
while
not
overly
complex
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
are
enjoyable
but
unfortunately
are
undone
by
a
weak
mouthfeel
it
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
coworker
whose
daughter
works
at
the
brewery
ive
tried
several
6packs
of
bottles
over
the
last
year
but
overall
i
dont
particularly
care
for
it
it
seems
to
leave
me
with
an
oily
feeling
after
i
finish
a
bottle
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
there
is
better
out
there
an
enjoyable
englishstyle
dark
ale
goes
down
with
no
problem
whatsoever
but
i
do
wonder
about
the
mild
designation
here
this
just
seems
to
fit
right
into
the
realm
of
normal
regular
plain
and
what
have
you
medium
body
and
carbonation
creamy
a
very
pleasant
mild
dark
ale
very
drinkable
i
had
myself
fairly
hyped
for
this
beer
as
i
think
nelson
brewing
has
a
lot
of
potential
and
the
reviews
were
favourable
i
dont
think
it
quite
lived
up
to
my
hopes
but
it
is
a
solid
complex
beer
that
i
dont
regret
picking
up
my
everrovingbeersearching
father
brought
a
sixpack
of
these
back
from
revelstoke
bc
for
me
thanks
dad
341ml
bottles
with
a
purpleblue
label
showing
the
brewery
and
the
nelson
brewing
logo
the
cap
reads
the
natural
choice
of
the
kootenays
the
beer
is
a
lovely
dark
ruby
colour
the
borders
showing
some
butterscotch
brown
an
extremely
rich
and
appetising
hue
of
purple
mollasses
or
deep
chestnut
ebony
the
head
was
good
at
first
but
then
goes
down
to
a
thin
bubbly
layer
the
sheets
of
lacing
are
still
quite
healthy
though
the
aroma
is
big
on
the
sweet
chocolate
and
even
tobbaco
i
love
the
sugary
smell
unlike
the
salty
roasted
notes
of
a
porter
this
gives
more
raisins
and
french
vanilla
coffee
very
little
detectable
hopping
just
as
the
style
should
be
the
aroma
is
quite
sweet
but
still
nicely
balanced
with
the
dark
malts
to
create
a
very
mouthwatering
nose
a
lot
of
raisins
cream
licorice
candy
sugar
and
even
suble
blueberry
there
is
also
a
little
dustiness
from
the
dark
malts
nothing
overly
extraordinary
just
extremely
wellbalanced
the
taste
at
first
is
the
grainy
malts
and
raisins
and
chocolate
along
with
some
black
coffee
the
middle
is
a
lot
of
nearsour
chocolate
malts
and
some
charcoal
dryness
by
the
end
the
malts
really
dominate
and
leave
quite
a
bitter
feeling
in
the
mouth
the
hops
add
a
little
herbaceous
kick
in
the
finish
but
the
malts
leave
most
of
the
dryness
a
sweet
candy
flavour
but
put
together
very
well
to
give
a
balanced
and
delicious
flavour
that
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
as
the
website
says
this
is
a
great
session
beer
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
the
body
mediumfull
i
could
drink
these
all
day
or
nightplenty
of
flavour
at
5
and
they
go
down
like
a
cold
lager
this
is
everything
it
should
be
wonderful
lesserbrewed
style
here
in
canada
and
a
real
delight
to
try
wish
alberta
would
import
it
this
is
a
real
nice
mild
edging
towards
a
brown
ale
in
attack
the
beer
pours
all
brown
and
rich
with
a
slightly
tan
head
the
nose
is
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
is
all
smoothness
with
malt
to
the
front
and
a
good
finish
this
tastes
a
little
like
a
softer
version
of
their
faceplant
winter
ale
a
great
fall
beer
with
meats
and
soup
this
tastes
like
a
powerful
nut
brown
ale
heavier
on
the
malts
with
less
hops
hints
of
malted
chocolate
nuts
and
a
slight
sourness
to
it
it
seems
a
little
bit
thick
in
the
mouth
and
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
our
stout
than
something
lighter
however
the
excellent
taste
and
mild
abv
make
this
a
session
ale
the
brew
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
small
brownish
head
that
laced
out
quite
early
smell
of
co2
and
sour
yeast
started
crisp
with
lots
of
hop
tartness
then
sits
lightly
on
the
palate
with
an
adequate
malt
body
then
that
sour
yeasts
taste
comes
in
and
destroys
the
drink
overall
a
tad
watery
and
yeasty
to
be
an
english
brown
it
is
deep
brown
and
has
a
rich
chocolate
malt
flavor
you
can
really
taste
the
grains
in
this
one
it
also
uses
roasted
barley
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
considering
the
flavors
that
come
through
the
hops
merely
balance
everything
nicely
they
dont
add
much
bitterness
or
aroma
enjoy
one
at
their
home
in
nelson
b
c
one
of
the
prettiest
towns
ive
ever
visited
or
anywhere
else
in
british
columbia
since
the
government
run
liquor
stores
all
have
it
i
had
to
enjoy
this
one
on
a
vacation
to
british
columbia
and
enjoy
it
i
did
englishstyle
mild
ales
are
completely
unavailable
in
my
hometown
and
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
one
on
any
of
my
other
travels
attractive
dark
brown
color
light
carbonation
light
head
and
little
lace
wellbalanced
flavor
that
strongly
reminded
me
of
theakstons
old
peculier
very
very
drinkable
a
real
find
in
one
of
those
goofy
governmentrun
liquor
stores
final
thoughts
im
to
understand
that
this
was
once
marketed
as
a
stout
much
like
their
india
pale
ale
if
this
is
a
stout
this
is
the
mildest
lamest
stout
ive
ever
experienced
as
a
dark
mild
ale
well
i
guess
it
fares
better
but
it
wasnt
as
flavourful
as
id
want
it
to
be
stick
to
the
ipa
or
the
red
if
you
want
to
drink
keiths
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
the
beer
looks
good
its
dark
the
head
looks
good
its
too
dark
to
see
any
bubbles
in
it
i
cant
smell
anything
though
to
be
fair
that
could
be
my
nose
its
never
been
the
greatest
the
taste
seems
more
like
a
stout
to
me
than
a
mild
ale
very
coffee
like
however
i
note
that
the
can
does
describe
the
beer
as
more
of
a
stout
than
a
mild
the
beer
felt
watery
to
me
in
my
mouth
after
a
very
pleasant
fizzing
sensation
from
the
carbonation
i
thought
the
beer
was
ok
to
try
once
overall
well
the
beer
looked
nice
in
the
glass
but
the
taste
really
ruins
it
perhaps
with
some
modifications
this
could
be
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
dont
bother
with
this
one
its
dark
creamy
and
guiness
like
except
with
a
hint
of
burnt
coffee
grains
as
well
not
fun
but
exactly
what
you
can
expect
from
such
a
beer
it
honestly
ruins
the
stout
type
style
if
people
only
look
at
this
and
refer
to
it
as
a
proper
stout
theres
some
beautiful
stouts
out
there
but
this
is
not
to
be
included
in
the
list
ordinary
beer
definitely
the
best
of
the
lot
as
far
as
this
brewer
is
concerned
more
of
an
english
brown
ale
and
pretty
plain
all
the
same
still
i
found
this
adequately
drinkable
huh
one
of
the
more
drinkable
of
their
beers
though
mediocre
for
a
dark
ale
pours
deep
brown
without
any
lasting
head
neutral
to
slightly
malty
aromas
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
it
is
sweetish
to
begin
with
but
carries
a
small
yet
harsh
metallic
finish
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
d
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
full
of
flavor
look
elsewhere
but
when
youre
somewhere
that
basically
only
has
macro
choices
its
a
good
way
to
go
i
had
this
one
on
draft
while
in
ontario
for
business
this
weekend
looked
inviting
with
a
nice
creamy
head
smell
was
mostly
roasted
malts
taste
was
very
good
a
nice
thick
flavorful
ale
similar
in
some
ways
to
draft
guinness
but
without
the
ashy
characteristic
this
is
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
during
a
sporting
event
or
while
chatting
with
some
friends
at
the
pub
much
better
than
other
alexander
keiths
brews
i
tried
this
week
id
drink
this
with
regularity
if
it
was
in
my
area
can
poured
a
light
black
color
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
limited
retention
aroma
of
adjunct
sweetness
with
limited
character
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
sweetness
originating
from
adjunct
body
is
way
too
light
with
average
carbonation
bland
no
character
and
too
much
adjunct
makes
this
a
bad
beer
i
had
this
one
in
a
bar
that
has
a
pretty
lousy
beer
selection
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
wasnt
bad
it
is
certainly
an
ale
and
a
very
dark
one
at
that
kinda
tastes
like
a
schwarzbier
in
its
roastyness
the
beer
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
more
flavour
than
i
expected
a
little
too
carbonated
and
not
totally
balanced
but
pretty
drinakble
and
low
in
abv
to
boot
whoa
overcarbonation
abounds
as
i
poured
this
into
my
glass
the
beer
was
very
dark
brown
with
clear
chestnut
edges
a
dense
beige
cap
formed
quickly
falling
and
leaving
a
lot
of
clumpy
lace
on
the
glass
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
stuck
around
for
quite
a
while
malty
aroma
a
bit
nutty
cola
sugary
sweet
faint
roast
the
flavour
and
body
were
unfortunately
thin
not
light
the
watery
texture
may
have
been
partly
due
to
copious
offgassing
during
the
pour
leaving
moderate
to
low
carbonation
behind
it
was
also
a
bit
coarse
grainy
and
dry
kind
of
astringent
the
taste
was
comparable
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
very
low
bitterness
not
very
appealing
after
starting
out
relatively
strong
this
one
ultimately
disappointed
overall
its
definitely
a
session
beer
not
a
sipper
more
interesting
than
your
average
ontap
offerings
d
overall
a
nice
beer
but
with
an
interesting
taste
its
pretty
drinkable
if
you
liked
it
itd
be
easy
to
have
a
few
or
several
i
imagine
i
just
dont
like
it
enough
to
do
that
one
was
fine
note
the
brewery
did
originally
release
this
as
their
stag
head
stout
which
honestly
probably
made
for
the
most
pitiful
unsatisfying
stout
ever
i
however
have
opted
to
grade
it
as
an
ambiguous
dark
ale
given
thats
how
its
being
sold
now
weak
mouth
feel
thin
sweet
far
too
sweet
in
an
adjunct
sweetness
bad
way
roastyness
and
coffee
tastes
are
there
but
the
weak
body
and
mouth
feel
combined
with
the
saccharine
sweetness
fouled
this
drink
for
me
keiths
dark
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
dry
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
and
some
herbal
bitterness
the
flavor
is
dry
with
some
nice
roasted
character
with
some
burnt
coffee
and
a
mild
astringency
there
is
a
bit
of
mild
graininess
i
would
guess
that
they
are
going
for
a
guinness
type
stout
more
than
a
mild
but
its
decent
beer
overall
its
nothing
special
but
way
better
and
more
bitter
than
their
ipa
d
this
is
a
half
decent
beer
in
comparison
to
most
of
the
macro
beer
that
is
available
on
tap
at
regualr
bars
and
restaurants
in
the
toronto
area
i
would
order
this
again
but
only
because
the
alternatives
are
so
bad
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
big
tall
boy
can
why
waste
time
on
a
grenade
smells
of
roasted
malts
but
not
much
hopping
pours
to
a
river
in
the
iron
range
translucent
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
upon
tasting
the
first
thing
that
stands
out
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
the
taste
starts
with
some
well
roasted
malts
then
gets
into
a
chaullky
chocolate
taste
with
a
mild
hoppiness
and
metallic
finish
tasty
beer
but
indeed
quite
thin
the
head
however
is
durable
and
gains
bonus
points
for
appearance
drinkable
but
not
a
standout
d
ok
drinker
but
lacks
serious
punch
overall
i
found
the
appearance
and
smell
surprizingly
positive
but
the
taste
a
bit
too
sharp
and
the
finish
too
abrupt
with
an
earthy
aftertaste
that
detracted
from
a
better
overall
score
the
finish
was
lacking
with
a
burnt
coffee
kind
of
thud
that
did
not
blend
well
with
the
rest
of
the
experience
still
for
a
mass
marketed
beer
its
well
worth
a
try
and
i
liked
it
better
than
their
more
popular
brand
that
they
call
an
ipa
drinkable
but
uninspired
too
subdued
alexander
keiths
dark
ale
is
dark
brown
in
colour
showing
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
its
beige
head
doesnt
last
very
long
and
doesnt
leave
much
lace
to
show
for
its
presence
it
smells
slightly
nutty
faintly
roasty
it
barely
has
a
scent
to
it
at
all
it
tastes
like
keiths
with
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
feels
thin
and
watery
its
like
they
took
the
regular
keiths
recipe
and
threw
in
some
specialty
malts
it
tastes
pretty
bad
and
doesnt
seem
very
well
thought
out
overall
this
beer
just
doesnt
come
close
to
fulfilling
my
expectations
of
a
stout
the
flavors
are
too
light
and
uninteresting
i
dont
hate
this
beer
but
it
is
just
not
great
in
any
respect
this
marks
the
worst
stout
ive
had
to
date
i
truly
wasnt
expecting
much
from
keiths
with
this
offering
but
this
fell
much
below
my
expectations
avoid
as
best
you
can
avoid
d
better
than
most
macro
beers
but
not
work
searching
out
its
quite
drinkable
and
i
can
see
how
this
would
seem
interesting
to
someone
who
has
never
had
anything
more
exotic
than
keiths
ipa
but
in
the
end
its
just
a
bland
offering
for
the
style
dark
ale
for
the
masses
yep
i
hear
you
johnnybarman
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
avoid
d
i
did
not
enjoy
this
much
at
all
it
was
lacking
in
all
aspects
and
to
boot
i
had
this
when
they
tried
to
call
it
a
stout
i
would
never
pay
a
premium
price
for
a
beer
like
this
when
there
are
others
out
there
which
are
far
better
tried
this
ontap
at
the
lower
deck
pub
i
may
be
bias
in
my
opinion
because
im
a
huge
keiths
fan
i
liked
it
not
my
favorite
keiths
mind
you
but
i
did
enjoy
it
had
a
guinness
look
to
it
but
a
hint
of
keiths
taste
and
it
was
not
overly
strong
or
thick
nice
beer
draught
sample
a
dark
brown
that
lets
some
light
in
pours
a
medium
sized
frothy
mocha
cap
that
recedes
to
a
thin
cap
nose
of
toasty
malts
some
milk
chocolate
mild
pit
fruits
some
hops
flavour
profile
is
much
of
the
same
with
the
chocolate
roasty
malts
a
bit
nutty
too
somewhat
fruity
leading
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
pretty
good
actually
but
seems
more
like
a
dunkel
to
me
tap
at
ocarrolls
colalike
appearance
dark
ruby
colour
nowhere
near
opaque
probably
a
shade
lighter
than
guinness
with
a
fully
diminishing
fizzy
offwhite
head
lightly
grainy
very
faint
chocolate
and
roast
aroma
with
some
acidic
and
vinous
notes
grainy
lightly
acidic
start
with
a
fruity
acidic
vinous
and
lightly
roasty
bitter
finish
light
if
i
stretch
it
i
could
get
as
far
as
light
to
medium
bodied
fizzy
almost
crisp
mouthfeel
very
lagerlike
feel
cleaner
than
i
expected
but
this
borrows
all
the
worst
aspects
of
labatts
velvet
cream
porter
guinness
and
sleemans
original
dark
its
a
dunkel
that
isnt
a
dunkel
a
porter
that
isnt
a
porter
guinness
that
isnt
guinness
and
most
importantly
a
stout
that
bears
no
resemblance
to
a
stout
of
any
kind
id
add
american
dark
lager
that
isnt
but
thats
probably
the
most
accurate
classification
for
this
its
not
terrible
granted
and
its
better
than
keiths
ipa
but
i
didnt
find
it
enjoyable
for
inbevlabattkeiths
to
call
this
a
stout
is
a
greater
heresy
than
calling
their
ipa
an
ipa
if
that
is
even
possible
poor
old
ak
rolls
in
his
grave
yet
again
maybe
try
this
is
there
is
nothing
else
availible
and
you
really
feel
the
need
to
have
a
beer
otherwise

as

its
a
very

drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good

overall
a
decent
dark
ale
that
is
sessionable
and
worth
another
go
a
tasty
dark
ale
sessionable
and
wellbalanced
for
sure
although
mild
might
not
be
the
most
appropriate
descriptor
because
the
flavour
is
fairly
full
for
a
5er
any
fan
of
brown
ales
would
have
little
difficulty
appreciating
this
stuff
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
solid
start
to
this
seasons
ocb
sampler
ill
definitely
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
stuff
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
really
wish
i
knew
about
these
guys
back
in
uni
because
they
would
have
been
a
nice
change
from
sleeman
and
wellington
overall
there
are
some
interesting
flavours
going
on
here
its
not
really
how
i
like
my
beers
to
taste
but
i
can
appreciate
the
fact
that
it
is
at
least
interesting
give
it
a
try
if
you
happen
to
see
it
d
a
delicious
easydrinking
ale
thats
well
worth
a
try
and
perfect
for
sessioning
5
abv
yes
but
tolerance
and
patience
take
care
of
that
if
it
is
impossible
to
transplant
the
charm
character
and
conviviality
of
the
traditional
english
countryside
pub
to
north
america
at
least
we
can
enjoy
the
flavour
of
a
good
dark
mild
ale
that
brings
back
images
of
such
a
place
i
feel
most
fortunate
to
have
a
brewery
offer
such
a
thing
so
close
to
home
ill
be
sure
to
thank
them
with
many
repeat
purchases
overall
really
a
really
great

despite

its

the

in

give
this
a
try
if
you
havent
already
good
stuff
well
worth
a
try
very
smooth
on
the

and
very
clean
fermentation
with
little
in
the
way
of

besides
a
very
slight

that
complements

perhaps
a

id
love

pretty

nice
to

worth
a

this
is
a
very
tasty
and
unique
ale
a
hybrid
i
think
some
nut
brown
character
with
dark
ale
profile
nice
blend
possibly
the
best
ale
from
this
brewer
the
overall
character
of
the
cask
version
is
very
similar
to
ontap
quite
clear
with
a
nice
chestnut
brown
colour
good
head
retention
malt
is
much
more
prominent
with
even
less
contribution
from
the
hops
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
low
carbonation
seemed
to
emphasize
lightness
in
the

quite
drinkable
and
good
for
a
session
brew
i
could
drink
this
and
look
at
its
dark

and
it
is
somewhat
rich
in
chocolate
malts

thanks
to
billy
for
this
one
overall
a
decent
quaffable
ale
hmmmm
not
bad
a
pleasing
blend
of
flavours
makes
this
quite
drinkable
although
it
doesnt
stand
out
body
could
be
a
bit
thickercreamier
a
decent
dark
ale
for
winter
drinking
easy
to
drink
and
on
the
sweetish
side
of
british
beer
scene
this
isnt
a
dry
bitter
beer
at
all
just
a
very
pleasant
ale
it
was
a
prefect
brew
after
a
long
winter
day
trip
in
the
welsh
countryside
dr
drinkable
enough
average
abv
great
price
and
decent
quality
try
it
but
dont
expect
much
it
would
be
better
if
it
were
ondraught
o
very
drinkable
session
ale
that
my
father
brought
back
for
me
on
his
trip
to
the
uk
reminds
me
of
a
schwarzbier
note
label
shows
4
1
abv
body
is
too
thin
d
id
like
to
try
this
on
cask
if
its
available
the
burnt
taste
makes
it
much
less
drinkable
not
much
aroma
apart
from
some
malt
which
was
nice
flavour
was
a
bit
flat
not
as
complex
as
others
but
toasty
to
the
point
of
burnt
with
little
malt
to
push
through
this
no
sweetness
at
all
and
a
bit
steely
as
well
i
guess
this
really
needs
to
be
off
the
cask
rather
than
bottled
a
lovely
ale
to
look
at
with
a
smooth
structured
seemingly
everlasting
ivoryhazelnut
head
atop
a
nearly
opaque
black
body
soft
and
mild
in
the
nose
with
timid
notes
of
nougat
caramel
and
peanuts
plus
a
faint
berrylike
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
more
upfront
deliciously
nutty
full
of
peanuts
and
almonds
buckwheat
tea
and
seedy
bread
there
is
a
steely
mineral
quality
in
the
finish
that
amplifies
the
dryness
of
the
beer
grassy
haylike
hops
appear
in
the
beginning
then
disappear
beneath
the
malts
to
resurface
as
a
slight
leafy
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
rollingly
soft
yet
light
on
the
palate
befitting
the
flavor
in
the
end
it
is
not
that
complex
or
robust
but
still
an
easy
quaffer
this
is
exactly
what
i
hoped
a
mild
would
be
i
would
so
love
to
try
this
on
cask
but
for
now
mouthfeel
is
okay
and
drinkability
is
also
okay
i
would
love
to
have
this
as
a
session
ale
given
the
abv
but
its
a
bit
sour
and
that
might
undercut
its
viability
as
a
session
beer
drinkability
this
beers
body
is
thin
to
medium
to
my
taste
and
the
aftertaste
is
not
long
enough
either
but
in
a
way
the
dryish
body
is
a
strong
point
to
make
it
a
different
mild
from
other
sweeter
and
more
watery
versions
i
truly
enjoy
this
beer
as
the
first
pint
after
a
days
hard
work
and
i
suppose
thats
exactly
the
kind
of
joy
and
sense
of
relief
this
classic
beer
brought
the
welsh
miners
of
old
as
well
other
comments
another
nice
real
ale
in
a
bottle
after
drinking
a
lot
of
pasteurized
bottled
english
ales
i
was
a
morrisons
shopper
its
been
a
real
treat
to
try
these
camrasanctioned
bottled
ales
available
at
sainsburys
an
awesome
welsh
cask
beer
on
cask
in
where
else
but
cardiff
dark
black
with
crimson
edges
the
aromas
are
all
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
some
floral
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
all
chocolate
roasty
notes
and
coffee
the
hops
are
almost
mia
but
they
are
there
in
the
back
cowering
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
an
awesome
dark
mild
by
a
very
underated
welsh
brewery
churning
out
some
fine
and
affordable
premium
cask
ales
for
all
the
citizens
of
wales
a
really
nice
mild
with
such
a
low
abv
it
has
alot
of
flavour
very
watery
nutty
smoke
and
earth
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favourite
every
day
dark
beers
along
with
carlton
black
they
are
both
an
australian
take
on
the
traditional
english
styles
similar
characteristics
but
with
a
lighter
body
and
higher
carbonation
to
make
them
easier
to
drink
in
a
session
and
more
refreshing
in
the
australian
heat
i
really
would
consider
them
more
an
excellent
version
of
a
dark
lager
than
an
english
dark
mild
decent
price
too
at
au45
a
case
of
24
x
375ml
one
of
my
favourite
pub
beers
is
a
tooheys
old
tooheys
new
blackandtan
i
will
say
i
do
prefer
old
on
tap
rather
than
in
the
bottle
but
good
nonetheless
not
a
bad
brew
but
kind
of
thin
and
somewhat
underwhelming
even
for
this
generally
anemic
style
theres
enough
flavour
to
make
a
go
of
it
if
moderation
and
sessionability
are
your
goals
for
the
night
but
for
a
singular
experience
this
just
doesnt
have
the
legs
o
surprisingly
good
beer
that
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
quality
beer
from
a
brewery
i
did
not
expect
much
from
worth
checking
out
o
very
light
and
mild
so
easy
to
drink
the
character
it
has
sets
it
above
most
australian
macros
but
still
a
very
average
beer
for
the
mass
produced
beers
of
the
land
down
under
this
one
gets
it
done
roasty
and
drinkable
this
is
the
pick
of
the
lot
in
most
sydney
pubs
for
me
this
one
is
more
nostalgic
than
high
quality
this
was
my
go
to
drink
for
some
of
the
best
years
of
my
life
so
ill
always
have
a
special
place
for
it
despite
how
average
it
is
on
the
grand
scale
a
slab
of
these
will
cost
ya
about
40
australian
bones
and
carrying
it
home
6
blocks
from
the
bottleo
is
great
for
the
biceps
its
got
a
faint
alcohol
taste
with
plenty
of
dark
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
gentlemans
class
to
it
mediocre
brew
in
the
land
of
lousy
brews
food
match
something
heavy
to
counter
the
dreaded
stomach
bloat
mentioned
above
i
think
a
roast
dinner
would
match
well
with
this
preferably
roast
beef
with
a
heavy
gravy
and
a
side
of
roast
potatoes
and
carrots
dark
brown
but
does
lighten
noticably
at
the
rim
good
nose
for
a
megalarger
sweet
toasty
malt
good
lift
doesnt
quite
translate
into
the
palate
traces
of
the
malt
evident
early
but
falls
into
a
more
mainstream
palate
with
some
fizz
and
some
weak
malts
to
finish
i
am
now
used
to
a
wonderful
roast
sweet
malt
aroma
and
easy
drinkability
quite
impressed
with
this
to
be
honest
drinkability
i
found
this
one
reasonably
drinkable
and
id
be
willing
to
have
a
second
one
but
id
not
seek
it
out
if
there
were
alternatives
but
on
the
other
hand
id
certainly
could
have
a
second
and
would
if
id
bought
two
of
them
the
best
on
offer
for
mass
produced
dark
beers
in
australia
but
seriously
thers
a
lot
better

d
this
beer
has
some
nice
schwartzbier
qualities
but
the
flavors
are
really
muted
and
not
much
depth
i
like
this
beer
better
than
some
of
the
modern
boutique
beers
becaiuse
they
try
too
hard
with
assertive
flavoursthis
one
is
effortless
real
traditional
and
also
wont
stonker
you
with
too
much
alcohol
a
bit
of
a
genuine
find
its
sad
to
know
that
one
of
the
best
macro
brewed
beers
in
australia
barely
achieves
a
score
of
3
tooheys
old
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
something
i
have
turned
to
at
pubs
that
give
only
macro
offerings
inoffensive
and
drinkable
but
there
are
so
many
much
better
micro
brewed
alternatives
second
tooheys
product
that
i
try
and
the
taste
is
good
easy
to
drink
as
well
another
decent
brew
from
tooheys
i
like
the
big
size
bottle
as
well
mouth
feel
is
creamy
a
bit
not
too
much
smells
good
overall
good
beer
im
really
taken
back
at
how
good
this
is
for
the
style
it
follows
it
well
and
is
a
solid
brew
the
other
australia
beers
my
buddy
brought
back
for
me
were
pretty
terrible
this
however
is
a
solid
english
dark
exceptionally
sessionable
at
its
current
abv
somthing
i
would
definatly
order
at
a
pub
not
real
interesting
but
very
drinkable
if
you
live
in
nsw
someones
bound
to
leave
some
at
your
house
eventually
go
for
it
this
was
the
first
ever
dark
beer
i
ever
tasted
20
odd
years
ago
and
i
hated
it
but
thankfully
my
tastes
have
improved
since
a
good
old
standby
drinkability
is
not
a
problem
i
have
tasted
dark
ales
that
tasted
a
little
heavy
with
artificial
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
reckon
the
watery
feel
works
in
this
ales
favour
overall
a
good
alternative
to
tooheys
usual
low
quality
lagers
a
solid
very
flavourful
beer
i
got
introduced
to
this
brew
at
bondi
icebergs
in
sydney
nsw
i
was
quite
impressed
it
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
lovely
mahogany
dark
color
and
the
head
was
thick
for
a
beer
on
co2
the
nose
had
hints
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
which
translated
nicely
to
the
taste
where
i
found
more
dark
chocolate
notes
the
flavour
is
very
nicely
balanced
sweet
enough
for
me
while
still
a
bit
bitter
on
the
finish
to
balance
it
off
a
great
session
brew
actually
my
ba
avatar
is
a
photo
of
this
beer
at
bondi
icebergs
i
highly
recomend
the
pub
and
the
beer
as
you
can
see
the
view
is
quite
nice
cheers
mates
inoffensive
of
course
and
quite
drinkable
but
certainly
nothing
to
streak
naked
around
a
bar
over
unless
thats
your
thing
overall
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
cheaper
beers
by
aussie
standards
drinkability
i
prefer
most
ales
to
american
lagers
to
me
this
is
a
great
session
beer
if
it
werent
for
my
schedule
id
still
be
sitting
in
a
pub
in
oz
drinking
tooheys
old
but
without
a
sharp
taste
instead
of
being
a
bit
bland
i
lost
interest
in
the
beer
pretty
quick
and
downed
it
fast
d
tasty
sessionable
beer
there
are
others
id
go
to
first
but
i
wouldnt
knock
this
one
back
one
of
the
best
macro
brews
ive
had
drinkability
okaverage
d
relatively
smooth
beer
to
drink
but
doesnt
have
much
flavor
to
it
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
good
session
beer
and
beats
alot
of
the
macro
crap
you
can
get
on
tap
this
stuff
is
almost
everywhere
overall
i
rate
this
beer
highly
i
have
fond
memories
while
partaking
of
this
beer
not
much
bitterness
or
hop
flavour
it
would
probably
be
better
left
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
little
while
and
would
be
a
great
winter
beer
perhaps
a
pint
or
2
before
a
game
of
football
d
ok
wouldnt
be
one
i
go
for
again
drinkability

nice
black
but
still
see
through
color
with
slightly
off
white
head
slight
smell
of
roated
malts
and
tiny
spiciness
tastes
nice
mild
roast
flavors
and
slight
sweet
carmel
touch
without
being
the
slightest
bit
in
your
face
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
personally
i
like
my
roast
malts
a
little
more
standoffish
however
the
light
touch
with
the
roast
malts
and
smooth
mouthfeel
make
it
easy
to
drop
a
few
back
pours
very
black
with
a
stringy
off
white
head
which
doesnt
last
tastes
strangely
similar
to
new
but
with
a
much
more
satisfying
maltiness
and
a
slight
chocolatey
nuttiness
to
it
quite
sweet
and
smooth
like
most
ales
in
australia
probably
not
actually
an
ale
feels
quite
lagery
and
often
very
carbonated
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
and
had
very
little
in
the
way
of
aroma
very
faint
smell
of
roast
malt
it
tastes
slightly
malty
slightly
chocolatey
and
slightly
hoppy
but
not
too
strong
of
anything
it
does
have
flavor
its
just
fairly
well
balanced
has
a
pretty
clean
finish
for
a
dark
beer
very
drinkable
since
the
alcohol
taxing
debacle
in
australia
tooheys
have
reduced
the
percentages
of
most
of
their
beers
this
includes
changing
the
recipe
for
old
it
was
a
big
mistake
it
used
to
be
a
refreshing
porter
at
4
5
and
is
now
a
strange
soapy
dishwater
ale
at
4
3
or
something
like
that
i
dont
know
if
it
was
ever
4
8
but
i
dont
have
one
of
the
old
ones
here
to
compare
with
i
think
it
was
always
4
5
anyway
they
changed
the
label
as
carlton
did
with
vb
and
as
other
beers
have
too
my
advice
if
you
can
buy
any
of
the
old
ones
with
the
black
label
get
them
while
theyre
still
good
they
keep
for
a
long
time
in
the
fridge
but
really
avoid
the
red
label
newer
ones
practically
everywhere
now
they
are
very
soapy
this
review
is
in
fact
for
the
ontap
kind
i
had
one
on
tap
at
the
nsw
leagues
club
near
hyde
park
barracks
a
few
weeks
ago
and
since
a
nice
cold
old
is
what
i
really
felt
like
i
was
so
disappointed
when
i
got
the
nastysmelling
and
tasting
crap
that
they
have
produced
for
some
months
now
i
will
never
have
another
old
until
they
change
the
recipe
or
unless
im
really
stinging
for
one
and
im
out
in
the
bush
somewhere
where
someone
has
bought
a
case
and
theres
nothing
else
to
drink
for
miles
other
than
that
never
im
disappointed
it
used
to
be
my
favourite
session
beer
and
indeed
one
of
the
only
regularly
available
session
porters
in
nsw
too
bad
makes
a
nice
cold
weather
session
beer
great
tasting
and
not
too
high
on
the
abv
really
the
best
australian
beer
around
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
great
aroma
of
chocolate
and
some
spices
this
however
is
not
a
stout
its
more
of
a
black
ale
similar
to
a
belgian
black
ale
or
a
german
schwarzbier
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
nothing
bad
flavor
is
rich
and
inviting
with
a
nice
hop
bite
after
the
chocolate
australia
had
a
lot
of
crappy
brews
and
most
of
tooheys
offerings
were
in
that
group
this
one
however
is
not
as
with
monteiths
black
its
a
dark
beer
you
can
have
a
session
on
and
for
a
brewer
that
is
known
for
brewing
particularly
dismal
beers
even
compared
to
carlton
its
a
real
standout
at
least
tooheys
have
shown
with
this
beer
and
by
subsidising
the
james
squire
brewery
that
they
have
some
slight
interest
in
brewing
a
quality
beer
they
get
points
for
that
alone
but
hey
this
is
one
of
the
beer
hunters
favorite
aussie
beers
its
hard
to
argue
with
that
assessment
i
certainly
dont
as
far
as
drinkability
it
was
pretty
tasty
and
was
my
favorite
brew
while
i
was
down
there
i
know
what
ill
be
looking
for
the
next
time
im
around
brisbane
i
liked
this
one
it
kinda
tastes
like
a
bad
black
and
tan
but
its
not
all
that
bad
very
drinakble
especially
on
tap
dont
know
that
its
a
stout
though
more
like
porter
or
english
style
old
ale
nice
light
smokiness
hints
of
leather
coffee
chocolate
and
smooth
mouthfeel
good
session
beer
drinkable
but
rather
average
it
looks
superb
with
a
towering
head
however
its
all
downhill
from
there
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
dull
and
lacklustre
with
weak
malt
character
and
little
else
going
on
body
is
ok
but
not
amazing
if
a
mild
is
judged
by
its
maltiness
then
this
one
is
below
par
goes
down
easily
enough
but
nothing
special
no
need
to
seek
it
out
a
solid
effort
from
thwaites
the
flavours
were
enjoyable
but
a
little
subdued
and
didnt
really
grab
your
attention
the
mouthfeel
was
good
however
and
the
alcohol
content
was
just
right
making
it
an
easy
beer
to
drink
all
in
all
not
bad
o
a
dark
beer
that
is
probably
for
people
who
are
looking
to
get
into
this
type
of
stoutdark
beer
style
defiantly
not
for
the
connoisseur
very
underwhelming
thin
and
light
even
by
mild
standards
it
does
hold
a
few
surprises
though
especially
the
dose
of
roast
which
snuffs
any
fruit
not
sure
i
get
the
fugglesekg
combo
at
full
strength
on
the
whole
id
prefer
very
nutty
nice
dark
ruby
edging
into
black
body
with
a
thin
but
dense
tan
head
the
scent
is
of
mellow
roasted
malts
pleasant
fruity
hops
and
light
sugar
sweet
brown
sugary
malts
in
the
taste
low
hops
in
the
taste
and
a
creamy
light
chocolate
taste
smooth
but
light
body
low
but
still
noticeable
carbonation
pleasant
taste
and
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
nice
session
beer
pours
deep
brown
with
tan
smooth
head
weak
smell
of
roasted
malt
taste
is
like
a
kvass
watery
and
unexpressive
tones
of
roasted
malt
and
tints
of
chocolate
almost
no
mouthfeel
very
light
drinkable
my
first
mild
and
im
in
doubt
of
this
md
very
soft
on
the
carbonation
with
a
good
input
of
microscopic
fizz
this
mild
drinks
better
than
on
the
nose
refreshing
but
not
thin
by
any
means
well
worth
a
try
when
the
cask
is
still
fresh
enough
high
drinkability
would
definitely
drink
again
nice
abv
and
price
as
well
my
first
beer
from
thwaites
and
i
have
to
say
im
not
that
impressed
it
started
quite
well
the
apperence
is
a
very
dark
brown
but
all
the
rest
of
the
isnt
impressive
not
a
lot
of
flavour
going
on
and
the
beer
is
quite
watery
and
i
wouldn
buy
this
when
theres
better
milds
out
there
d
if
you
want
a
malty
beer
with
a
low
abv
then
this
is
pretty
good
some
chocolate
malt
flavours
would
make
it
a
bit
more
interesting
good
session
beer
none
the
less
o
i
like
it
not
a
style
im
very
familiar
with
but
its
nice
to
have
a
simple
unoffensive
sessionable
beer
every
now
and
then
isnt
it
o
we
need
more
of
these
beers
stateside
lower
alcohol
rich
and
malty
if
it
werent
for
a
drive
home
id
drink
this
all
night
time
to
find
out
if
this
is
currently
on
the
shelves
this
is
an
easy
drinking
mild
ale
as
it
should
be
low
in
alcohol
clean
and
tasty
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
wanted
something
low
in
abv
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
certainly
better
than
most
low
abv
beers
out
there
overall
not
bad
being
considered
a
mild
ale
i
see
why
it
is
thin
and
some
what
watered
down
feeling
flavor
profile
and
taste
are
much
along
the
lines
of
a
stout
which
i
like
rather
drink
a
more
full
beer
but
glad
that
i
tried
it
12

all
around
good

darkbready

flavors
nicely
robust
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
great
beer
overall
a
pretty
much
phenomenal
beer
given
the
abv
another
great
one
from
shorts
if
this
were
available
all
the
time
thisd
be
my
goto
session
ale
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
a
english
dark
mild
ale
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
all
that
great
drinkability
that
i
always
look
for
in
the
style
i
like
motor
citys
ghettoblaster
a
little
more
but
i
still
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
this
beer
had
very
good
drinkability
it
was
really
smooth
clean
slightly
crisp
not
filling
at
all
and
it
had
just
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
its
very
drinkable
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
pretty
nice
beer
to
pair
with
a
meal
what
i
liked
the
most
about
beer
was
the
drinkability
they
fit
a
good
amount
of
flavor
in
a
small
3
9
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
slightly
watery
but
i
think
thats
to
be
expected
from
a
3
9
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
also
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
if
they
ever
decided
to
release
it
on
its
own
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
easy
drinking
sessionable
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
theres
was
nothing
crazy
or
unusual
about
this
beer
its
just
a
solid
english
dark
mild
ale
and
im
glad
shorts
decided
to
include
this
in
their
new
variety
pack
nice
job
guys
thinks
for
mixing
it
up
with
a
style
that
just
dont
seem
to
be
that
popular
in
the
age
of
hoppy
and
barrel
aged
beers
these
milder
beers
still
have
a
place
in
my
hear
and
im
glad
shorts
doesnt
forget
about
them
keep
up
the
great
work
overall
a
nicely
malty
brew
with
a
sensibly
slackened
alcohol
presence
i
thought
it
was
a
pleasant
and
it
was
gone
in
a
flash
this
beers
pours
a
dark
copper
color
body
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
long
the
smell
has
a
nice
inviting
malt
characters
to
it
the
taste
upfront
has
nice
maltness
then
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
after
it
has
warmed
up
a
little
bit
then
comes
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
hop
presence
but
not
over
powering
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
poured
dark
brown
two
shades
shy
of
being
black
little
foam
very
fizzy
settles
out
funky
nutty
smell
taste
is
sweet
nutty
and
cola
flavored
earthy
from
notes
but
in
hindsight
not
really
a
little
like
flat
soda
or
a
funkier
nut
brown
mild
understates
it
hard
to
fully
describe
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
honestly
cannot
tell
the
difference
between
drinking
this
and
drinking
a
soft
drink
if
i
didnt
have
any
previous
knowledge
that
this
was
a
beer
id
think
i
was
drinking
flat
fountain
dr
pepper
mixed
with
cola
a
w
root
beer
and
sprite
this
is
really
just
a
watery
mess
i
picked
the
right
beer
to
have
before
leaving
for
work
i
was
worried
about
finishing
one
in
time
but
ive
drank
34
of
it
in
the
time
it
took
to
write
this
short
review
insanely
drinkable
but
thats
not
a
good
thing
in
this
case
sorry
magic
hat
but
you
continue
to
underwhelm
my
taste
buds
at
least
i
can
finish
it
and
its
not
a
drain
pour
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
overall
not
anything
super
special
but
has
some
nice
flavors
and
is
fairy
drinkable
magic
hat
is
a
clear
very
lively
copper
beer
with
a
thick
elastic
off
white
foam
theres
a
little
sweet
dark
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
herbal
medicinal
hops
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
the
finish
is
a
little
gritty
theres
not
a
ton
of
flavor
up
front
upon
the
finish
a
resiny
botanical
bitterness
rolls
in
with
the
sweetness
of
cake
or
bread
it
lingers
for
a
while
this
is
kind
of
like
a
lightenedup
brown
ale
its
mild
enough
to
be
inoffensive
and
its
pretty
unique
i
wish
there
were
more
beers
like
this
available
on
the
market
of
course
no
one
else
would
buy
them
overall
quite
disappointing
ive
had
better
beers
with
half
the
abv
so
it
cant
be
just
that
its
drinkable
but
only
just
watery
thin
palate
with
some
added
mineral
and
dry
qualities
dry
roasted
and
heavily
toasted
malts
has
some
flavor
a
little
on
the
darker
side
and
is
easy
to
drink
good
session
ale
for
sure
o
nothing
about
this
really
stood
out
from
the
lack
of
lace
and
head
to
the
mild
notes
on
the
nose
and
the
very
mild
taste
i
wasnt
really
impressed
by
any
part
of
this
brew
o
this
is
to
my
knowledge
my
first
exposure
to
an
english
mild
so
its
hard
to
compare
to
style
however
my
overall
impression
is
a
sessionable
brew
with
an
aroma
that
is
kind
of
blah
but
a
taste
which
is
actually
rather
nice
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
or
the
style
in
general
for
that
matter
but
ill
have
no
issue
finishing
the
last
bottle
thats
in
my
fridge
this
isnt
bad
but
not
great
either
again
the
creamy
butterscotchlike
notes
put
me
off
of
another
magic
hat
offering
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
b1426101480113
sampled
on
april
6
2012
the
pour
is
a
handsome
dark
amber
with
a
shortlived
offwhite
head
that
becomes
a
ring
on
the
nose
is
a
subtle
profile
of
sweet
malts
and
light
hops
and
a
little
nutty
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
but
smooth
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
then
mildly
bitter
it
is
a
drinkable
session
beer
hey
thisll
be
my
first
dark
mild
review
ive
partaken
in
several
pints
of
cigar
citys
el
lector
but
never
in
an
environment
conductive
to
reviewing
it
pours
out
a
deep
red
with
some
brown
tinges
to
it
a
centimeter
of
head
steadily
crowns
the
brew
the
aroma
is
primarily
nutty
with
chocolate
roastiness
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
good
its
got
a
nice
complexity
to
it
with
the
nuttiness
roastiness
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
all
intertwining
the
finish
is
earthy
and
hoppy
before
leaving
a
nice
clean
dry
feeling
on
the
palate
the
drinkability
is
as
to
be
expected
very
good
overall
its
a
good
mild
id
really
like
to
find
a
honest
dark
mild
from
england
to
compare
this
to
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
does
lacks
substance
nothing
exciting
here
pours
a
dark
chestnut
color
under
a
slim
frothy
ring
of
a
head
that
dissolves
to
nothing
nutty
malt
cereal
grain
and
some
dark
slightly
tart
fruitiness
a
little
too
clean
which
seems
to
be
an
issue
with
magic
hat
beers
over
the
last
several
years
dark
dry
malt
and
cocoa
flavor
but
somewhat
watery
faint
toast
and
fruit
finishing
dry
mediumlight
body
with
too
much
carbonation
at
first
too
sterile
and
bland
to
be
all
that
enjoyable
not
terrible
just
not
good
slight
citrus
bite
of
hops
up
front
followed
by
a
roasted
nut
flavor
with
a
bready
mouthfeel
that
quickly
gives
way
to
a
flat
fruit
flavor
plum
there
is
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
solid
beer
very
interesting
with
lots
of
subtlety
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
the
spring
mixpack
at
market
basket
in
somersworth
pours
a
brickred
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
khakicolored
head
smells
sweet
and
maybe
even
a
touch
sour
nut
chocolate
and
roast
dominate
the
flavor
light
to
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
while
the
aroma
is
a
bit
offputting
the
flavor
is
great
spoton
for
the
style
and
thats
not
easy
to
come
by
o
a
dumbeddown
version
of
a
classic
style
cant
say
that
too
many
times
about
american
brewers
when
they
brew
classic
english
styles
but
it
certainly
applies
here
still
worth
a
try
though
odlike
most
magic
hat
brews
this
one
has
its
bright
spots
but
is
mostly
lackluster
i
had
no
true
complaints
about
this
beer
but
it
was
pretty
bland
i
will
easily
finish
the
glass
and
will
also
give
kudos
to
magic
hat
for
trying
to
brew
some
of
the
lesser
utilized
styles
such
as
this
not
my
favorite
by
magic
hat
but
its
certainly
worth
a
try
grassy
sort
of
smell
poured
a
deep
coppery
brown
with
a
decent
dark
beige
head
head
reduces
to
a
light
film
in
a
minute
no
apreciable
lacing
taste
is
very
nice
but
unexciting
almost
minty
sweet
with
the
barest
hint
of
bittering
definately
mild
worth
a
try
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
hits
all
of
the
marks
sufficient
enough
to
be
a
mild
ale
but
just
does
not
seem
to
have
the
soul
of
that
style
perhaps
due
to
it
being
not
real
ale
and
most
of
the
milds
i
have
run
into
have
been
on
cask
or
bottle
conditioned
overall
average
too
easy
on
flavors
and
nothing
special
its
not
bad
at
all
but
its
too
weak
for
any
seasoned
craft
drinker
o
overall
it
is
drinkable
though
unremarkable
it
characteristics
appear
to
be
representative
of
the
style
so
its
worth
a
try
overall
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
beers
i
have
had
with
smooth
sweet
flavors
and
a
nice
smooth
body
would
have
another
it
has
kind
of
a
belgian
feel
to
it
though
otherwise
its
pretty
straightforward
english
brown
ale
ive
never
heard
of
a
dark
mild
ale
as
ba
calls
it
but
it
is
dark
and
mild
overall
an
average
brew
a
little
light
on
flavor
for
me
i
prefer
el
lector
by
cigar
city
not
sure
if
means
0
is
the
math
they
were
shooting
for
i
really
cant
say
it
is
bad
you
could
drink
them
fine
but
it
just
isnt
worth
buying
craft
beer
for
this
little
flavor
almost
tastes
like
an
unhopped
homebrew
kit
made
exclusively
from
liquid
malt
extract
pours
a
pale
dark
copper
color
with
a
light
beige
head
forming
thick
and
dwindling
slow
visually
im
all
about
this
beer
the
smell
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
with
light
dark
roasts
thats
about
it
light
fruity
accents
generic
tart
cherry
with
cereal
toasted
grains
flavor
is
light
but
has
a
creamy
dark
roasted
malts
with
fruit
notes
pretty
mild
ale
that
shows
me
one
thing
magic
hat
has
been
going
toward
the
mainstream
this
beer
tastes
like
a
pseudo
craft
from
a
mislabeled
abi
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
moderate
carbonation
slightly
soft
textures
going
on
easy
to
drink
a
no
brainer
ale
with
enough
flavor
to
help
you
get
through
it
however
it
doesnt
really
push
the
envelope
or
do
anything
for
beer
lacking
some
complexity
has
a
nice
sweet
flavor
up
front
but
quickly
drops
off
and
not
much
else
takes
its
place
i
guess
it
pretty
much
fits
the
bill
for
a
mild
ale
but
it
is
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
first
off
whats
up
with
this
label
intriguing
i
guess
maybe
thats
why
i
grabbed
it
from
my
friends
fridge
to
try
it
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
no
head
at
all
moderate
fizz
of
carbonation
the
body
was
the
color
of
cola
smell
was
nonexistent
taste
was
just
a
bit
of
malt
and
some
caramel
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
this
beer
just
had
no
redeeming
qualities
to
it
at
all
just
plain
boring
mostly
minus
for
me
it
lives
up
to
its
name
its
neither
here
nor
there
i
could
do
with
or
without
it
plus
or
minus
whatever
cool
label
and
way
to
nail
the
name
another
plus
o
very
good
session
beer
probably
my
favourite
magic
hat
beer
like
liquid
and
slightly
watered
down
bread
pudding
this
one
is
caramel
and
toffee
and
butter
and
all
of
it
come
from
the
malts
here
no
attempts
to
be
dry
with
an
english
ale
yeast
character
and
a
high
degree
of
residual
sugar
bittering
hops
balance
it
well
though
so
the
beer
is
robustly
flavored
its
darker
in
color
pushing
deep
copper
with
a
tall
white
lasting
head
in
a
big
mug
at
the
pub
next
door
to
the
brewery
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
how
sweet
it
is
largely
attributable
i
think
to
the
light
body
almost
too
light
for
the
flavors
in
this
beer
it
needs
a
little
more
texture
carbonation
is
fine
though
and
the
beer
still
comes
across
pretty
rich
a
nice
hearty
take
on
the
style
one
of
the
better
and
more
complete
beers
i
have
had
from
these
guys
a
very
nice
dark
amber
ale
with
a
smooth
finish
after
the
bread
caramel
and
slightly
roasted
dark
malt
flavors
medium
body
and
easy
drinking
good
mouth
feel
nice
color
and
smell
with
the
appropriate
head
for
a
4
oz
sampler
glass
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
at
4
6
abv
and
20
ibu
good
drinkability
as
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
at
a
decent
price
the
beer
list
at
the
brewpub
labels
this
as
a
scottish
ale
it
is
decent
but
not
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
still
it
is
worth
a
try
wow
what
an
amber
fuller
than
most
its
got
a
lot
of
really
great
malt
flavor
to
it
its
not
overly
sweet
there
are
some
slight
hops
in
there
balancing
it
all
out
my
favorite
part
is
the
appearance
its
a
bit
dark
than
i
would
stereotype
carbonation
is
good
and
i
like
the
drinkability
not
too
shabby
d
alright
a
little
too
subdued
for
the
style
d
excellent
session
beer
goes
down
easily
tasty
and
although
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
doesnt
seem
to
be
too
high
excellent
amber
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
really
nice
amber
with
golden
hues
littel
head
from
service
and
just
a
little
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
nice
but
actually
a
bit
faint
tastes
rich
and
malty
as
advertised
with
a
medium
body
too
lively
at
first
but
carbonation
leveled
out
later
smooth
and
a
nice
complement
to
my
pasta
dish
but
i
wouldnt
get
too
excited
about
it
drinkability
right
in
there
with
you
average
amber
ale
worth
a
try
for
sure
a
clear
dark
amber
ale
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
a
light
balance
of
malt
hops
strong
malty
flavor
blended
quite
nicely
with
the
hops
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
slightly
bitter
overall
this
reminded
me
strongly
of
what
a
lighter
version
of
fat
tire
would
taste
like
a
good
session
beer
i
wish
that
a
i
had
tried
more
than
4
oz
of
it
and
b
i
lived
closer
to
billings
mt
the
menus
logo
for
this
beer
displays
a
bear
sitting
in
a
hammock
with
growler
on
his
belly
fantastic
the
beer
is
cola
colored
with
a
1
mm
head
of
foam
the
beer
seems
both
tart
and
sweet
i
suspect
ringwood
yeast
has
been
used
an
apple
favor
is
present
as
well
as
hints
of
tabacco
an
interesting
beer
and
overall
quite
drinkable
